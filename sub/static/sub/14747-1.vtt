42nd street.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.179
34th Street. Penn Station.

03:15.945 --> 03:17.779
Hurt?

03:17.864 --> 03:19.698
It hurt.

03:19.782 --> 03:21.867
Did they treat you all right?

03:21.951 --> 03:24.536
The place was dirty.

03:24.621 --> 03:28.290
Well, sure, baby.
It was a‒ It was a free scrape.

03:28.374 --> 03:32.711
It was a favor.
Can't expect Columbia Presbyterian.

03:33.796 --> 03:35.380
No more favors.

03:36.299 --> 03:39.301
Smoke a joint?
I told you to smoke a joint.

03:39.385 --> 03:41.553
He said it was illegal.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.027
The chick is sick.

03:57.111 --> 03:58.695
She's all right.

04:06.663 --> 04:09.081
You gonna play with your brushes,
or you gonna pay me?

04:09.165 --> 04:11.583
How much?
$50.

04:12.627 --> 04:15.587
Come on!
What are you talking about?
You said you had it yesterday.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.714
Well, yesterday
was yesterday.

04:17.798 --> 04:19.841
Today's today, right?
Right.

04:21.302 --> 04:22.928
I'm splitting.

04:23.012 --> 04:26.932
Okay. Okay, $50. Okay.
I know a guy. He owes me 100.

04:27.016 --> 04:28.433
All right.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.602
Is it any good?

04:30.687 --> 04:32.688
I don't know.
I don't use it.

04:34.357 --> 04:37.442
What do you want me to tell you, Marco?
It's from Tangiers? It's from Tangiers.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.695
Okay, I'm gonna get my coat.
Okay.

04:49.914 --> 04:52.165
What's the matter?
You all right?

04:52.250 --> 04:54.001
What, are you cold?

04:54.877 --> 04:56.461
Here.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.298
Put this over you.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.389
When I'm around,
I'll pick it up sometime.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.641
Okay, let's go.
Okay.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.310
I'll be back soon.

05:12.395 --> 05:16.148
Marco! Who did that?
She did.

05:16.232 --> 05:18.233
Oh, yeah?

05:22.155 --> 05:24.531
All right,
how do you spell Reeves?

05:24.615 --> 05:26.783
R-E-E-V-E-S.

05:26.868 --> 05:29.661
R-E-E-V-E-S.
You a member of Blue Cross?

05:29.746 --> 05:32.581
No, I'm not a member
of the Blue Cross.

05:32.665 --> 05:35.917
Member of any other
medical plan?
Jesus, I'm bleeding.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.545
Look, I have to have
this information for my records.

05:38.629 --> 05:40.922
Three pads in 10 minutes.

05:46.804 --> 05:48.889
Oh, can I help you?

05:48.973 --> 05:52.684
Uh, no. I'm going over to 424.
Yeah.

05:52.769 --> 05:56.855
Oh, well, visiting hours
happen to be over.
Come back tomorrow, okay?

05:56.939 --> 05:59.816
Aw, that's my sister.
She's sick.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.986
I just flew in from Jersey City.
Well, tomorrow at 2:00.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.946
2:00?
Right. 2:00 to 5:00.

06:23.257 --> 06:24.800
Hey.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.468
Hey.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.471
What are you doing here?

06:31.224 --> 06:33.475
I come, uh, for my scarf.

06:33.559 --> 06:34.893
Oh.
Remember?

06:34.977 --> 06:36.645
Mm-hmm.

06:37.730 --> 06:40.565
Um, how did you know I was here?

06:43.444 --> 06:47.364
I know a guy down the hall
in one of the rooms,
and he told me.

06:47.448 --> 06:51.159
Said there's this terrific-looking
chick in room 424,

06:51.244 --> 06:53.161
so I thought I'd come
and take a look.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.038
You seen Marco?

06:55.123 --> 06:57.416
Yeah, Marco.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.042
He split.

06:59.127 --> 07:02.212
He, uh‒
He had a gig somewhere.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.926
Well, you know them artists.
They're always splitting.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.847
Hey, how'd you get in here?

07:13.641 --> 07:16.184
I got my ways.

07:20.356 --> 07:23.984
Um, what are you gonna do?
Where you gonna go?

07:24.068 --> 07:25.610
I'm gonna go home.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.779
Oh.

07:27.864 --> 07:30.031
Where's home?

07:30.116 --> 07:31.992
Fort Wayne.

07:32.076 --> 07:33.743
Illinois.
I did time there.

07:33.828 --> 07:36.371
No, I-it's Indiana.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.457
Indiana?
Mm-hmm.

07:38.541 --> 07:41.293
I did time there too, I think.
Yeah. Indiana.

07:41.377 --> 07:42.711
Did time all over.

07:45.047 --> 07:47.215
Hey, uh, I lost your scarf.

07:48.509 --> 07:51.219
Blew right off of my head.
Terrible.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.515
I tell you what. To make up for it,
you can draw a picture of me.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.142
I can?
Sure.

07:57.226 --> 07:58.727
You're a great artist.
You!

07:58.811 --> 08:01.313
I said visiting hours
are over.
That's right. You told me that.

08:01.397 --> 08:03.899
Time to leave.
I was just saying
good-bye to my sister.

08:03.983 --> 08:06.985
And there are no planes
from Jersey City, either.
Oh, there are.

08:07.069 --> 08:09.863
There's a helicopter,
lands on the Pan Am building.

08:09.947 --> 08:11.948
Then a limousine takes you down.
It's terrific.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.367
You're a wonderful dancer.
You know that?

08:14.452 --> 08:15.577
Dyke.

08:50.446 --> 08:52.280
Hey!

09:00.289 --> 09:03.458
Give my best
to your old lady.
Okay, I'll do it.

09:13.094 --> 09:14.719
You're everywhere.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.471
My scarf.

09:26.315 --> 09:28.900
- You know I been in KY twice?
- KY?

09:30.069 --> 09:31.987
KY. Lexington.
Oh.

09:32.655 --> 09:35.615
Another thing.
I've been in jail eight times.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.869
Don't congratulate yourself
on my time.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.539
Oh! Ten times?

09:43.791 --> 09:46.793
How's 12 times?
I can't impress you.

09:48.379 --> 09:50.630
I told my brother about you‒
my brother Hank.
You did?

09:50.715 --> 09:53.258
Yeah.
He's gonna love you, man.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.554
Only he better not love you too much
'cause I'll kick his ass.

10:00.182 --> 10:03.351
You don't have to
worry about money either.
I got plenty of that.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.686
Yeah?
Yeah.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.104
I got nothin', man.

10:08.899 --> 10:11.776
Hey, we'll take a little trip.
Want to take a trip?
Mm-hmm.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.237
Ever been to Philadelphia?
No.

10:14.322 --> 10:15.864
Neither have I.

10:17.366 --> 10:20.035
What do you want to
go to Philadelphia for?
What?

10:23.539 --> 10:26.541
You know, I never had
an old lady around before.
They tie you down.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.252
You don't have to
have one now.
Don't say that.

10:36.802 --> 10:39.304
I‒

10:40.723 --> 10:43.558
He didn't like
responsibility much.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.644
Who?
Marco.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.732
You stuck on him
or something?
No.

10:51.692 --> 10:53.568
Well, proves
you ain't dumb.

10:57.573 --> 10:59.324
Who's this?
Me.

11:05.414 --> 11:07.374
He the father
of that kid?

11:07.458 --> 11:08.958
Who?

11:09.043 --> 11:10.418
Marco who.

11:11.420 --> 11:13.004
I guess so.

11:15.925 --> 11:18.093
That's some answer.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.728
You really got a place?

11:28.813 --> 11:31.731
Nah. Not a regular place.
I got a lot of places.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.274
Mmm.

11:33.359 --> 11:36.361
Listen, you wanna do me a favor?
Just keep walking. Go ahead.

11:36.445 --> 11:39.447
Don't look back. I'll be right back.
Just keep going.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.631
Merry Christmas.
What are you
gonna do with it?

11:56.716 --> 11:59.926
It's yours. Go ahead.
I don't have a place for it.
I don't even have a‒

12:00.010 --> 12:03.388
Come on. Take it.
How's it feel to steal something?

12:04.348 --> 12:05.807
Twelve dollars.

12:05.891 --> 12:08.101
This is UHF.
You get everything on here.

12:08.185 --> 12:10.145
You want Chicago,
you get Chicago.

12:10.229 --> 12:13.231
You get Turkey, I hear,
on this thing.

12:13.315 --> 12:14.524
Come on.

12:14.608 --> 12:17.193
I'll give you $15, okay?

12:17.278 --> 12:19.696
Esther,
I'm a dope addict.

12:19.780 --> 12:21.698
I heard that before.
Give me something new.

12:21.782 --> 12:23.908
I'm a sex-crazed dope fiend.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.953
Come on. Here. I'll give you $20, huh?
Twenty dollars!

12:27.037 --> 12:29.789
I'm dying from the dope,
Esther.
And I'm dying from hunger.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.583
Go already,
will you, please?

12:36.297 --> 12:38.339
Twenty-five dollars.

12:39.175 --> 12:40.759
Twenty-three dollars.

12:40.843 --> 12:42.844
Two dollars
for the sandwiches.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.271
How you feel?
Mmm.

12:56.525 --> 12:59.527
What was it like
where you come from?

13:01.363 --> 13:04.115
I mean,
when you was a kid growing up.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.534
It was all right.

13:06.619 --> 13:10.246
I was born and went to school.
Hmm. That's good.

13:10.331 --> 13:14.667
I had a mother and a father
and a little brother and a lawn.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.377
Terrific.

13:17.379 --> 13:19.964
I was always going
to art classes,

13:20.049 --> 13:22.717
and my mother was always
going to the doctor.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.053
It was all right.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.930
Why'd you leave, then?

13:29.266 --> 13:31.810
Don't just go around
leaving people for no reason.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.398
I wouldn't.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.692
Well, you shouldn't.
It ain't right.

13:49.286 --> 13:51.079
I won't.

13:52.414 --> 13:53.998
Good.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.398
Hi.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.942
Hi.

14:24.613 --> 14:27.907
- How do you feel?
- Mmm.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.626
You slept.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.469
If you want to bad enough...

14:54.435 --> 14:56.519
It's all right.

14:58.147 --> 14:59.856
Don't worry about it.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.737
It's too soon.

15:05.821 --> 15:07.447
We can.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.376
Go to sleep.

15:53.869 --> 15:55.370
Hey.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.164
Oh. Good morning.

15:58.248 --> 16:00.375
You're gonna kill yourself doing that.

16:02.836 --> 16:04.837
I'm not hooked.
I'm just chipping.

16:08.050 --> 16:10.802
You know what
the big thing at Marco's was?

16:10.886 --> 16:12.679
What?

16:12.763 --> 16:15.348
Grass brownies.

16:16.558 --> 16:18.893
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

16:27.861 --> 16:29.988
Where we going?
Chico.

16:33.242 --> 16:35.493
What's cooking?
How you taking it, man?

16:35.577 --> 16:38.913
Slow, baby, slow.
Who's the chick?

16:38.998 --> 16:40.957
Helen.
Helen, this is Chico.
Hi.

16:41.041 --> 16:43.418
She feeding
your arm?
Aw, man.

16:45.462 --> 16:48.715
Hey, Bobby.
You got anything, man?
No.

16:50.050 --> 16:52.927
- Sonny, this is Helen.
- Hotch has been around.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.013
Oh, yeah?
Piss on Hotch.

16:56.098 --> 16:59.267
Why don't you eat
your French fries?

16:59.351 --> 17:03.604
Come on. You eat like a canary.
That's probably why you're sick all the time.

17:07.108 --> 17:09.694
See these things?
Mm-hmm.

17:09.778 --> 17:12.821
I've been living on these
since I was 10.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.824
That's why I look so good.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.704
I suppose
you eat health food.

17:19.788 --> 17:22.248
I do not.
Yeah?

17:23.459 --> 17:25.501
How's a health food addict
like Needle Park?

17:25.586 --> 17:28.421
Here he is.
Hey, Bobby, how are you?
Good morning.

17:28.505 --> 17:31.215
Mr. Sammy.
This is Helen. Sammy.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.718
How's your paranoia, eh?
It's coming along.

17:33.802 --> 17:36.387
Helen, how are you?
♪ Shabba-doo, shabba-doo,
shabba-doo ♪

17:36.472 --> 17:39.557
I'll just take one.
I'm on a diet.
Have a French fry.

17:40.476 --> 17:44.187
I'm gonna go see this guy down at--

17:46.398 --> 17:48.232
Terrific. Terrific.

17:49.068 --> 17:52.487
- Thanks.
- See you again. Hey, she's cute.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.572
Give him my best, will ya?

17:56.492 --> 17:59.202
I like it here.
Yeah?

17:59.286 --> 18:01.412
All your friends are here.
You're here.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.247
Some friends.

18:03.332 --> 18:07.668
You know I've been beat by
half the people out there? Half of them.

18:09.797 --> 18:12.965
Hey, there's Hank. Hey! Hank!

18:14.551 --> 18:16.385
Hey! Hank!

18:16.470 --> 18:18.429
Dumb bastard's deaf.
Wait a minute.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.349
Oh!
Where you going?

18:21.433 --> 18:25.103
Watch this guy! He don't know
where he's walking! Hey! Hank!

18:25.187 --> 18:26.729
Hank!

18:39.076 --> 18:41.911
Why don't you go
direct traffic?

18:51.213 --> 18:53.464
Fucking Hotch.
Who's Hotch?

18:53.549 --> 18:55.258
He's a prick.

18:55.342 --> 18:56.884
He's a narco.

18:59.388 --> 19:02.974
This is my brother Hank.
Hank, this is Helen.

19:03.058 --> 19:05.101
She's an artist.
Yeah?

19:05.185 --> 19:07.270
What kind of artist?
Bad paper?

19:07.354 --> 19:09.355
Bad paper.

19:12.109 --> 19:13.901
Where'd you meet her?

19:15.445 --> 19:19.031
What is this, a party?
Look who's here.

19:20.075 --> 19:22.869
See Hotch?
Yeah.
You were right.

19:24.121 --> 19:27.999
Say, uh, you still selling grass in the Village?

19:28.083 --> 19:29.667
When I get a chance.

19:29.751 --> 19:32.753
I bet the spades think
you're a real bad man.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.382
Hank's a burglar.

19:38.427 --> 19:41.554
It's my business.
It's what I do good.

19:41.638 --> 19:45.016
Go ahead. Tell her how you never got caught.
Ain't never got caught. Tell her.

19:45.100 --> 19:47.018
Get out of here.
Go ahead!

19:48.395 --> 19:51.981
- I'll tell her how you get caught.
- No. Not me.

19:52.065 --> 19:53.816
Tell her.
Go ahead, tell her.

19:53.901 --> 19:59.280
Well, you see, uh, when I go into an apartment,
I, uh, I jam the lock,

19:59.364 --> 20:02.533
stick some toothpicks
in the keyhole
and break them off.

20:02.618 --> 20:04.785
That way,
when people come back,

20:04.870 --> 20:08.831
I can hear them
trying to get in,
make it out the fire escape.

20:09.625 --> 20:12.043
I copped
a television yesterday.
Yeah?

20:12.127 --> 20:14.712
Yeah.
What'd you get,
10 bucks?

20:14.796 --> 20:16.380
Twenty-five.

20:19.801 --> 20:22.053
Six hundred bucks
last night alone.

20:22.137 --> 20:24.263
Aw, terrific.

20:26.308 --> 20:28.309
What's he going for there?

20:29.561 --> 20:30.895
Little treat.

20:33.106 --> 20:36.108
Why don't you get
a decent meal?

20:36.193 --> 20:39.278
Aw, Hank. Ten dollars.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.867
I'm gonna keep this.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.203
What a brother I got.

21:04.012 --> 21:05.638
Bobby?

21:17.150 --> 21:18.776
Bobby?

21:54.688 --> 21:56.981
Miss Montez.
Room 41.

21:57.065 --> 21:58.733
Thank you.

22:00.402 --> 22:02.278
Hey.

22:02.362 --> 22:04.822
Sonny said you were here.
Yeah, I told him to tell you.

22:04.906 --> 22:09.076
I was worried.
I didn't know where you were.
Oh, man. What a night.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.120
What's that?

22:11.204 --> 22:12.955
What's what?
What we got here?
Yeah.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.749
Coffee, man.
Yeah.

22:15.375 --> 22:19.003
We saw them sitting
outside a delicatessen.
There's a cop.

22:19.087 --> 22:21.464
Shit.
Quick. Under here.

22:21.548 --> 22:22.923
Damn.

22:25.677 --> 22:29.680
Poor cop, just sitting there all day,
watching the germs go by.

22:29.765 --> 22:32.266
Carrying coffee.
Carrying coffee.

22:34.353 --> 22:37.813
You want to go up?
Two rings for up.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.787
I don't know.
I'm just nervous. What?

22:52.871 --> 22:54.497
There he is.
There he is.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.833
Come on!

22:57.918 --> 22:59.460
Did you get
the stuff?

22:59.544 --> 23:01.379
You're beautiful.
Did you get the stuff?

23:01.463 --> 23:03.839
Come on.
Move your ass. Yeah.

23:03.924 --> 23:07.718
Easy, man, easy.
Instant. Hey!

23:07.803 --> 23:09.387
This is Helen.

23:10.639 --> 23:14.725
Listen, there's a Pic 'n' Pay
grocery store on 74th Street.
Get the number, all right?

23:16.395 --> 23:19.730
Hey, man, I had to go
up to 112th Street to score.

23:19.815 --> 23:23.234
Some kid said he'd cop for me,
but I didn't want to get beat.
Nobody does, baby.

23:23.318 --> 23:25.069
Nobody ever does.
Hardly.

23:25.153 --> 23:27.696
Bobby, get me some water,
would you?

23:27.781 --> 23:29.907
How much
is it going for up there?

23:29.991 --> 23:35.413
Seven bucks
for a nickel bag, and it's shit.
It certainly is.

23:35.497 --> 23:37.832
Enjoy.
Oh. Thanks.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.583
Did you get the number?

23:39.668 --> 23:42.169
555-3092.

23:45.382 --> 23:48.634
You shouldn't have worried.
I had to go uptown to score.

23:48.718 --> 23:50.469
It's all right.

23:52.973 --> 23:54.515
Is he okay?

23:55.684 --> 23:59.228
He's just a little sick.
Hey, Mickey, you all right?

23:59.312 --> 24:04.024
He's all right.
Mickey boosted a vet's office
and shot himself full of worming medicine.

24:04.109 --> 24:06.235
Hey, Mickey,
how's the worms?

24:11.616 --> 24:13.742
Here.
Hold that for me.

24:13.827 --> 24:15.202
Doing all right.

24:16.163 --> 24:18.956
I took this guy for 48 cartons
of cigarettes once.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.750
I told him I'd leave him alone
if he bought our stuff.

24:21.835 --> 24:23.878
Hey, Penny,
look what Daddy's got.

24:26.715 --> 24:28.966
Yeah.
Two cartons of instant.

24:29.050 --> 24:32.094
No, man. I didn't boost
any cat food from you.

24:32.179 --> 24:34.472
What would I want
with some kitty litter?

24:34.556 --> 24:37.808
♪♪
All right, you want it or not, man?

24:37.893 --> 24:40.895
All right.
Okay, I'll be by then.

24:41.563 --> 24:44.273
How do I know when?
I'll get there when I get there.

24:44.357 --> 24:46.650
All right, forget when.

24:48.195 --> 24:50.196
- You eaten yet?
- No.

24:51.364 --> 24:54.742
Gonna hit the spot.
Hey, Bobby, give me a soda, would you?

24:54.826 --> 24:56.160
Eeeeyahhhh!

24:56.244 --> 24:57.661
Here, Mr. Chico.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.622
All right!
Enjoy life.

24:59.706 --> 25:02.708
Uh-huh.
Try to. Light my fire.

25:05.086 --> 25:06.629
Ooh.

25:07.297 --> 25:10.174
Cookin'.
Now I'm cookin'.
Cook that some more.

25:10.258 --> 25:11.842
Yeah. I got--

25:11.927 --> 25:13.844
That's my girl in there.

25:14.971 --> 25:17.973
It's a real panic, man.

25:18.058 --> 25:20.601
It's worse than '68.

25:20.685 --> 25:24.146
The dealers
have all gone down to Florida
and they're driving the prices up.

25:24.231 --> 25:26.607
It's worse than '64 even.

25:27.567 --> 25:31.237
I seen guys kicking their habit
in the streets,

25:31.321 --> 25:32.947
puking in the alleyway.

25:33.031 --> 25:35.699
It's an election year.
That's why there's no shit.

25:35.784 --> 25:38.869
What election?
I don't know, man.
Some election.

25:38.954 --> 25:43.123
Next time you boost clothes,
I want a size six.
I don't like to wake up alone.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.379
I don't want you to.

25:50.465 --> 25:52.967
But it happens sometimes,
you know.

25:53.051 --> 25:55.469
Believe I'm gonna do it.

25:56.596 --> 26:00.683
'Cause this panic's
something else, man.
It's-It's something else.

26:00.767 --> 26:04.144
This guy was telling me
that they burned...

26:04.229 --> 26:09.024
10 tons of raw heroin
in Turkey.

26:10.360 --> 26:16.031
If I went away somewhere,
would you come with me?

26:18.994 --> 26:22.371
- Where?
- I don't know.

26:22.455 --> 26:24.331
Yeah, do it, baby. Do it. Yeah.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.000
Somewhere.

26:27.127 --> 26:28.877
All right, getting‒
getting it in.

26:28.962 --> 26:33.007
Yeah. We can go
to Fort Wayne, Indiana.

26:34.301 --> 26:36.927
No, I could get a job
selling encyclopedias.

26:37.012 --> 26:40.014
I want to make a good impression
on your folks, right?

26:41.516 --> 26:43.934
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:44.019 --> 26:48.105
Yeah, the politicians
are putting the heat on.
Politicians.

26:48.189 --> 26:52.484
And that's why we gotta pay $7.00
for a $3.00 bag.

26:53.737 --> 26:55.529
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

26:56.865 --> 26:59.283
Joe says it'll break tomorrow.

26:59.367 --> 27:01.744
Tomorrow, man.

27:01.828 --> 27:05.873
Well, if it don't float now,
I tell you, man‒

27:12.213 --> 27:13.964
Mm-hmm.

27:55.507 --> 27:58.008
You're not going
anyplace without me.

28:00.011 --> 28:01.845
- Mmm.
- Okay?

28:29.582 --> 28:31.542
You know what you are?

28:31.626 --> 28:33.335
What am I?

28:42.262 --> 28:43.929
You're my girl.

28:46.474 --> 28:48.016
Right?

28:54.023 --> 28:55.482
Hey.
What?

28:55.567 --> 28:57.609
You wanna be
Miss Subways?

28:57.694 --> 28:59.153
Oh, yes.

28:59.237 --> 29:00.654
Yes?
Yes.

29:00.739 --> 29:04.950
I know a guy who could get you in.
You don't have to ball him or anything.

29:07.078 --> 29:10.748
Think I could get
something at the hospital?
Sure. You can get busted.

29:10.832 --> 29:12.583
Can't get nothing nowhere.

29:12.667 --> 29:14.793
Hey, there's Hotch.

29:19.591 --> 29:22.801
Two weeks ago
it was coming in like the morning milk.

29:23.845 --> 29:27.264
I know someone
who shot paregoric
and shoe polish.

29:27.348 --> 29:30.559
What?
It's a high.

29:30.643 --> 29:32.978
Hey, good night, Irene.

29:34.355 --> 29:37.691
Hey, baby.
What's happening?

29:37.776 --> 29:39.943
Hey, baby.
You holding anything?
Shit.

29:40.028 --> 29:43.697
They have more stuff
in the house of detention
than they do out here.

29:43.782 --> 29:46.408
What kind of stuff?
Smack, man.

29:46.493 --> 29:49.620
- All the butches be pushing.
- Looking pretty butch yourself.

29:49.704 --> 29:52.623
Yeah, well, when you in the house,
you play along.

29:52.707 --> 29:55.125
Smack with a bombita. That's good.

29:55.210 --> 29:58.045
Smack with anything
is pretty good. Coke.

29:58.129 --> 30:00.798
That's cool.
What'd they get you for, Irene?

30:00.882 --> 30:03.091
Robbery.

30:04.969 --> 30:07.304
They sure did, Jim.

30:07.388 --> 30:11.225
I walked up to this john on 72nd Street.

30:11.309 --> 30:14.603
No problems with smack
and coke, baby, none at all.

30:14.687 --> 30:16.522
You ever try shooting glue?

30:17.398 --> 30:19.900
- You mean sniffing it.
- I mean shooting it.

30:19.984 --> 30:22.236
John turns out to be a narco.

30:22.320 --> 30:25.072
- You know the best high of all is?
- What is it?

30:25.156 --> 30:27.825
- They busted me for robbery.
- Death.

30:31.913 --> 30:34.832
Never mind that shit.

30:34.916 --> 30:38.252
I said, "Man, I ain't no robber.

30:38.336 --> 30:40.337
I'm a prostitute."

30:43.883 --> 30:47.219
He told me it was on
75th Street and Broadway.

30:49.097 --> 30:51.598
Wait over there.
Wait over there.

31:03.945 --> 31:05.445
Come on.

31:58.291 --> 32:02.461
Sir. Hey, man.
I need to use the phone.

32:03.504 --> 32:05.505
It's out of order, man.

32:14.515 --> 32:16.016
Right.

32:21.397 --> 32:23.231
This really sucks!

32:35.453 --> 32:37.037
I've been beat.

33:02.814 --> 33:05.732
Come on, man.
You beat me, huh?
I'm sorry, man.

33:05.817 --> 33:08.318
- You took off on my bag?
- There wasn't enough to go around!

33:08.403 --> 33:12.322
- You bastard! Where's his money?
- Look at me straight!

33:12.407 --> 33:16.493
The trash can on 71 st Street.
There's some shit maybe.

33:24.585 --> 33:26.086
I got it.

34:02.081 --> 34:04.207
What are you doin'?

34:19.766 --> 34:21.641
I can't.

34:22.685 --> 34:24.478
I can't.

34:25.313 --> 34:28.273
I c-- I can't.
Hmm?

34:28.357 --> 34:30.400
Why?

34:30.485 --> 34:32.652
Not when I'm doing junk, man..

34:33.737 --> 34:35.155
I can't.

34:37.992 --> 34:39.451
All right?

34:39.534 --> 34:42.245
When I'm straight, okay?

34:44.706 --> 34:46.248
Tomorrow.

34:47.668 --> 34:49.168
All right?

34:51.255 --> 34:52.880
Tomorrow.

35:00.807 --> 35:02.390
Okay?

35:06.312 --> 35:09.731
No, no, no.
What do you mean, no?
I want my key, man!

35:09.816 --> 35:11.358
Not until you pay your rent.

35:11.442 --> 35:14.653
You charge rent in this germ factory?
You oughta pay me to stay here.

35:14.737 --> 35:17.531
Can I get my things?
Lady, you won't
miss your things.

35:17.615 --> 35:21.284
Whoa. Some clientele you got here.
Regular resort for spade hookers.

35:21.369 --> 35:24.246
They pay their rent.
You're beautiful.
You know that?

35:24.330 --> 35:25.413
You're lovely.

35:25.498 --> 35:28.083
Regular palace you got here,
huh?

35:28.709 --> 35:30.252
Bobby.

35:35.299 --> 35:36.800
Hey.

35:39.095 --> 35:41.054
Chico got busted.

35:41.139 --> 35:45.016
We can use his place.
Paid up till the end of the week.

35:45.101 --> 35:47.519
Okay.
Okay.

35:54.110 --> 35:57.487
I'm a germ.
You should split.

35:57.572 --> 36:00.699
You don't have to tell me when to go.
I'll just leave.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.498
Listen.

36:19.135 --> 36:21.720
I want you to do me a favor.

36:23.222 --> 36:25.849
Go up to 119th Street for me.

36:27.602 --> 36:30.312
I want you to score for me.

36:31.606 --> 36:33.315
You could.

36:33.399 --> 36:35.859
Yeah, I could, yeah.

36:36.903 --> 36:40.864
You're not just asking me to score for you.
You're asking something else.

36:46.120 --> 36:47.495
What am I asking?

36:47.580 --> 36:49.873
You're asking how much I'll do for you.

36:49.957 --> 36:52.042
Yeah. So?

36:52.126 --> 36:53.835
So...

36:55.213 --> 36:57.047
all right.

37:13.022 --> 37:16.024
Shh-shh-shh.

37:17.485 --> 37:20.028
Shh.

37:25.952 --> 37:28.036
You looking for someone?

37:28.120 --> 37:29.829
Freddy.
Who?

37:29.914 --> 37:31.957
Freddy.

37:32.041 --> 37:33.541
Why?

37:35.002 --> 37:37.963
Are you Freddy?
Why?

37:41.467 --> 37:44.803
- He's got something for me.
- Oh, yeah? What?

37:46.681 --> 37:48.682
Are you Freddy?

37:50.226 --> 37:51.726
Yeah.

37:57.024 --> 38:00.777
No. Wait, wait, wait. No.

38:00.861 --> 38:02.320
No, no.

38:06.951 --> 38:10.578
Hey, what's this? It's only $11.

38:10.663 --> 38:13.498
That's all I've got.
That's not enough.

38:13.582 --> 38:15.875
But that's all I've got.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.795
Maybe we can
take it out in trade.

38:18.879 --> 38:20.922
Goddamn garbage can!

38:21.007 --> 38:23.425
Hey, what's up?
What's the matter, man?

38:23.509 --> 38:26.428
Put your hands
against the wall.
Get your feet out.

38:26.512 --> 38:29.222
- What's wrong with you cats?
- Bark my goddamn shin.

38:29.307 --> 38:30.807
I'm clean, man.
Find anything?

38:30.891 --> 38:35.395
- Yeah, found the whole store.
- That's not mine, man.
That belong to somebody else.

38:37.064 --> 38:38.815
Whose is this?

38:38.899 --> 38:42.736
- That's a lightweight bust.
You cats don't want no lightweight bust.
- Turn around.

38:44.905 --> 38:47.324
I've seen you around, Helen.

38:47.408 --> 38:49.951
His name's Hotchner.
Bobby knows him.

38:57.084 --> 38:59.419
Bobby's got you
scoring for him already, huh?

39:03.132 --> 39:05.216
Come on.
We'll give you a ride downtown.

39:06.177 --> 39:09.220
I'm not going downtown.
Come on.
We'll give you a ride.

39:09.305 --> 39:11.973
I don't know
where Bobby is.
Come on.

39:12.058 --> 39:15.101
That's not mine, man.
It belongs to somebody else.

39:18.731 --> 39:20.273
Hey, Hotch.

39:22.943 --> 39:27.113
Freddy says he doesn't
want to give us Jocko.
The dude is my friend, man!

39:29.617 --> 39:31.785
You wanna get out, Freddy?
Yeah, right here.

39:31.869 --> 39:36.498
This is fine right here.
Just pull over. I'll just-- Huh? Okay.

39:36.582 --> 39:38.541
I'll just get out right here.

39:38.626 --> 39:41.753
That'll be three years, Freddy.

39:41.837 --> 39:43.713
What do you mean,
three years, man?

39:43.798 --> 39:46.299
Well, you're sittin'
on a one-to-three.

39:47.301 --> 39:50.220
We'll tell the judge
how cooperative
you've been,

39:50.304 --> 39:54.140
and, uh, that'll be good
for three years.

39:55.476 --> 39:58.103
Oh, man.

39:58.187 --> 40:01.189
I'm up for welfare, man.
That's gon' blow it for me.

40:01.273 --> 40:03.900
So, set up Jocko.

40:05.152 --> 40:08.822
You call him up, you make the buy.
You know how the game is played.

40:08.906 --> 40:12.367
- Just have to cop from him once.
- You already done busted the dude once.

40:12.451 --> 40:14.744
We don't mind busting people twice, Freddy.

40:14.829 --> 40:18.331
Shit. Man, you cats
must be out of your minds.

40:40.980 --> 40:45.400
No, man, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
The cat might not be home, man.

40:45.484 --> 40:48.486
Wait a minute. You have a dime?
I don't have a dime.

40:56.370 --> 40:59.038
Bobby never told you
about a panic, did he?

41:00.583 --> 41:05.086
This time next month,
he'll be ratting for a couple of bags.

41:05.171 --> 41:06.463
Everybody rats.

41:08.757 --> 41:12.969
One day you pick up a newspaper,
you read a little story in there.

41:13.053 --> 41:16.806
Maybe the feds
pick up 220 pounds of shit at the docks.

41:16.891 --> 41:18.558
Nobody reads about it.

41:20.269 --> 41:24.731
But for the next six months,
you got everybody kicking
on the streets and ratting on each other.

41:27.401 --> 41:30.862
That's one thing you gotta
remember about a junkie‒
he'll always rat.

41:35.034 --> 41:36.659
Always.

41:39.246 --> 41:42.290
Come on, Bobby.
Don't try to bullshit me.

41:43.709 --> 41:47.837
Have pity, man.
You got your habit back.
He's only chipping.

41:49.048 --> 41:50.840
I chip.

41:50.925 --> 41:52.550
He uses.

41:53.552 --> 41:56.596
- Fifty bucks a day.
- Thirty.

41:56.680 --> 41:58.723
That's two bills a week.

41:58.807 --> 42:00.975
This is just the beginning of the panic.

42:03.354 --> 42:05.939
Where's the money
gonna come from, Bobby?

42:08.025 --> 42:09.692
Huh?

42:14.573 --> 42:15.949
What are you gonna do?

42:18.285 --> 42:20.411
Well, I'm not gonna do it with you.

44:46.100 --> 44:47.475
Come on, man!

44:48.769 --> 44:51.437
Give me a chance to get set,
all right?

44:53.565 --> 44:55.441
Hit the ball now!

44:55.526 --> 44:57.276
Let's go! Let's go!

44:58.737 --> 45:01.280
Oh!

45:01.365 --> 45:04.867
Where you throwing it?
Here, let it bounce here.

45:06.120 --> 45:08.538
You gotta bounce it here.
Higher.

45:08.622 --> 45:10.915
Wait for your pitch.
Wait for your pitch.

45:19.466 --> 45:21.217
Right?
Oh, man!

45:21.301 --> 45:24.220
Aw, man!
What did I do, man?

45:25.472 --> 45:27.724
Back off.
You're lucky!

45:28.809 --> 45:31.352
I was the Babe Ruth
of West 81 st Street.

45:31.437 --> 45:33.646
That's right.
I hit that ball.

45:36.150 --> 45:40.737
I hit the ball on the roof one time.
I went up to get it,
there was this crap game going on.

45:40.821 --> 45:44.240
I won $79 before my next turn at bat.

45:44.324 --> 45:46.242
Huh?
I'm the greatest!

45:49.580 --> 45:52.165
Hey, Helen, get it. Go ahead.

46:09.600 --> 46:10.892
You got it.

46:30.954 --> 46:32.580
When did that happen?

46:59.983 --> 47:01.651
Banana cake.

47:31.181 --> 47:32.682
Hey.

47:35.602 --> 47:37.603
Let's get married.

47:41.400 --> 47:43.234
No? Why not?

47:46.446 --> 47:48.447
Come on.
Let's get married.

47:54.413 --> 47:56.372
So?

47:57.749 --> 48:00.126
What are you gonna live on?

48:01.211 --> 48:02.879
Whitey owes me 19 bucks.

48:02.963 --> 48:05.590
Oh, there's a start!

48:06.633 --> 48:09.385
If you're lucky,
maybe you can cop two bags with that.

48:09.469 --> 48:12.722
- No, I'm quitting.
- Sure.

48:12.806 --> 48:15.558
The responsibility.

48:15.642 --> 48:17.643
You're not gonna quit.

48:20.939 --> 48:23.900
You're gonna
come in with me.

48:25.152 --> 48:27.987
I got a nice little job
lined up.
No.

48:28.071 --> 48:29.906
I-I'm gonna get a job.

48:29.990 --> 48:32.408
That's good,
but this is nice.

48:32.492 --> 48:35.828
Something we can take
with ease.
I'm gonna get a job.

48:35.913 --> 48:41.292
Sure. What are you gonna do?
Portrait artist?

48:42.920 --> 48:44.670
Oh!

48:44.755 --> 48:46.797
I'm sorry.

48:46.882 --> 48:50.301
Darling, I wanted
a jelly doughnut,
not the chocolate.

48:50.385 --> 48:53.721
You said two coffees
and two chocolate‒
No. No, honey. You got it wrong.

48:53.805 --> 48:55.097
I wanted a hot chocolate.

48:55.182 --> 48:57.725
Hot chocolate.
Hot.

48:57.809 --> 48:59.852
Three black coffees.
Three coffees.

49:00.854 --> 49:02.605
Look at this.

49:07.694 --> 49:10.404
What would you like?
Cup of coffee
and a sardine sandwich.

49:10.489 --> 49:13.282
Cup of coffee
and a sardine sandwich.

49:14.368 --> 49:16.410
May I have
the hot chocolate, please?

49:16.495 --> 49:17.662
What?
Hot chocolate.

49:17.746 --> 49:20.706
Hot chocolate.
Here you go.

49:20.791 --> 49:24.001
You got
that jelly doughnut?
Just a minute.

49:34.012 --> 49:36.973
You're not holding out
on me, are you?
Three tricks, that's all.

49:41.520 --> 49:43.354
It's cold, baby.

49:47.693 --> 49:50.653
Can we have
a napkin, please?
Get 'em yourself.

49:53.740 --> 49:56.200
I can work at Pic 'n' Pay.

49:56.284 --> 49:58.577
All the groceries I can steal.

50:00.247 --> 50:04.458
I'm gonna work for Hank.
I don't want you taking shit from nobody.

50:11.675 --> 50:13.509
Come on, baby.

50:16.138 --> 50:18.264
I just--

50:42.456 --> 50:45.291
Hey, Bobby.
Wedding present.

50:46.376 --> 50:47.877
Oh.

50:47.961 --> 50:51.213
One's for her.
A couple of toasters.

50:51.298 --> 50:53.591
That's your problem.
Bobby, tonight.

50:53.675 --> 50:56.177
About tonight, once more.
Tell me. What do we do?

50:56.261 --> 50:58.179
Hank, again?
Again.

50:58.263 --> 50:59.889
I let you in.
You let me in.

50:59.973 --> 51:02.308
Right.
You bring up the stuff.
I bring up the stuff.

51:02.392 --> 51:06.937
Right. I back in the truck,
load it up, and off we go.

51:07.022 --> 51:08.606
Off we go.

51:08.690 --> 51:10.357
12:00.
12:00.

51:18.116 --> 51:20.743
Have you seen Bobby?
No, he ain't been‒

51:20.827 --> 51:22.661
He wasn't here?
Not tonight.

51:27.501 --> 51:29.168
Irene, you seen Bobby?

51:29.252 --> 51:32.213
Bobby?
 How the fuck should I know where Bobby is?

51:32.297 --> 51:36.092
- He was gonna meet Hank at midnight.
- It's only half past.

51:37.344 --> 51:38.844
Jesus, he said he'd be here.

51:38.929 --> 51:42.098
Bobby's gonna be late
for his own wedding.

51:46.603 --> 51:48.729
You sure he hasn't
been here?
You still on that?

51:48.814 --> 51:52.399
I just heard Bobby's OD'd.
He took a hot shot of junk.
What do you mean?

51:55.195 --> 51:58.280
Get him out of here!

51:58.365 --> 52:00.074
- He's dying.
- Get him on his feet.

52:00.158 --> 52:04.370
Oh, he's not gonna die!

52:04.454 --> 52:10.209
He's not dying here. You hear me?
Get him out of here. That's all I care about.

52:10.293 --> 52:12.920
- Get some towels.
- I only got one towel!

52:13.004 --> 52:14.964
Just do it!
Come on.

52:15.048 --> 52:17.466
Comes up here all the time.
I don't need him!

52:17.551 --> 52:19.885
Just keep him walking.
Come on, man!

52:19.970 --> 52:22.054
Come on.
Jesus!

52:22.139 --> 52:25.933
What did he take?
Is he gonna be all right?
Get him over here.

52:30.355 --> 52:34.150
Come on, man.
Come on. Come on.

52:34.234 --> 52:36.402
Where's the towel?
Come on.

52:36.486 --> 52:38.320
Hold him up.

52:38.405 --> 52:41.157
- Here's your towel.
- Give me the towel.

52:41.241 --> 52:45.619
He better not die, that's all.
'Cause I don't want no death in here.

52:45.704 --> 52:48.289
He ain't dying in here,
you hear me?
Shut up!

52:48.373 --> 52:51.292
Come on!

52:51.376 --> 52:55.588
- Will you shut that kid up?
- What am I supposed to do?
It's the maid's night out.

52:55.672 --> 53:00.593
Can you see? Come on.
Huh? Huh? All right.

53:00.677 --> 53:03.053
Would you do it
someplace else?
Shut up!

53:03.138 --> 53:05.890
Hey!
Come on.

53:05.974 --> 53:07.766
Come on. Come on!

53:07.851 --> 53:10.936
- Come on. I got business here.
- Aw, shut up!

53:11.021 --> 53:13.689
Don't tell me to shut up.
It's my place, isn't it?

53:13.773 --> 53:16.025
He's gotta puke.
He's not puking
on my floor.

53:16.109 --> 53:19.361
We don't want to mess up
your establishment.
I don't want him smelling up this place!

53:19.446 --> 53:20.988
I got business here!

53:22.324 --> 53:25.993
Come on.
Can't you just
take him in the hall?

53:26.077 --> 53:31.540
If he dies, Marcie, you can lay him out
with the baby and the three of youse
can turn the trick together.

53:36.004 --> 53:40.341
I didn't ask him to visit!
I really need this, don't I?

53:47.182 --> 53:50.392
Listen, he can't stay here.
Please. I got a trick coming.

53:50.477 --> 53:53.812
He's sick.
Sick my ass!
It's a $40 pop.

53:53.897 --> 53:56.273
I didn't ask him
to get off in here.

53:59.152 --> 54:02.988
Helen, could you take care of the kid
just till I get rid of the john?

54:03.073 --> 54:05.824
What's he gonna say
when he sees a kid here?
Yeah. Yeah.

54:05.909 --> 54:07.826
Maybe he'll offer to adopt youse both.

54:07.911 --> 54:09.912
Oh, please.
He's a regular.

54:11.831 --> 54:15.751
Oh, Jesus. Come on.
Come on, come on.

54:15.835 --> 54:17.711
Come on.

54:17.796 --> 54:20.214
Come on.
Give me a walk. Come on.

54:24.803 --> 54:27.930
What a trip.
What a trip.
I got him. Bring the baby.

54:28.014 --> 54:29.515
Shh!

54:35.981 --> 54:37.898
Not in the sink.

54:40.902 --> 54:42.945
Oh, baby.

54:43.029 --> 54:45.948
Can't you
keep him quiet?
Hey, Marcie, have fun.

54:49.869 --> 54:54.206
You tell Hank... never again.

54:56.293 --> 54:58.252
I swear to God.

54:59.629 --> 55:02.798
Last night, tonight.
What difference does it make?
So I fucked up.

55:02.882 --> 55:05.592
That's the story of your life‒
fucking up.

55:05.677 --> 55:09.138
What do I got to do,
carry you every place
to make sure you get there?

55:09.222 --> 55:10.973
Is that what a brother's for?

55:11.057 --> 55:15.227
What do you think,
it's some kind of "he's not heavy,
he's my brother" crap?

55:15.312 --> 55:18.355
Let me tell you something, man.
You are heavy.

55:18.440 --> 55:21.525
I was hustling a hot truck
all last night waiting for you.

55:21.609 --> 55:24.486
So we'll get
another one tonight.
So I get another one tonight.

55:24.571 --> 55:26.905
All right.
You just be there.

55:26.990 --> 55:28.657
Psst!

55:34.873 --> 55:37.791
Bring the stuff up to here.
I'll go around and get the truck.

55:37.876 --> 55:40.044
Now, look, man.
Don't fuck up.

55:40.128 --> 55:42.921
Don't open the door
until I knock, okay?

56:16.539 --> 56:17.956
Hank?

56:26.466 --> 56:27.883
Hank?

56:27.967 --> 56:29.551
I'm clean!

56:29.636 --> 56:32.554
You're gonna be clean
when you get on the outside.

56:32.639 --> 56:35.641
Yeah, baby.
Nothin' to do with‒

56:35.725 --> 56:38.060
They let you out, huh?

56:38.144 --> 56:41.647
Man, when I get out,
my first shot--

56:41.731 --> 56:44.733
You're never getting out.
Those cats out there
are shooting castor oil.

56:44.818 --> 56:48.654
The dealers have all split.
You know Santo,
the guy who runs the West Side?

56:48.738 --> 56:51.156
Santo?
Ever hear of Santo?

56:51.241 --> 56:55.828
We don't know him here.
What's his name again?
San-what?

56:55.912 --> 56:58.080
Santa Claus?

56:58.164 --> 57:00.624
You listen to me!
That's the truth.

57:00.708 --> 57:06.171
Santo's looking for someone
to take over the West Side,
just till the heat's off.

57:06.256 --> 57:09.091
Just till the heat's off.
You gonna take it over, baby?

57:09.175 --> 57:14.388
The next thing I know,
there's a big shipment in...

57:15.348 --> 57:19.017
and Santo is in charge of it all,

57:20.186 --> 57:23.480
and they need somebody
to come in with them.

57:25.692 --> 57:28.610
So everybody is wondering...

57:28.695 --> 57:31.155
and talking about
who it's gonna be.

57:31.239 --> 57:33.365
So guess who it's gonna be.

57:35.201 --> 57:36.827
Well, who?

57:36.911 --> 57:38.495
Me.

57:39.998 --> 57:41.957
Santo wants you?

57:42.041 --> 57:44.251
Why not? Anybody.

57:46.421 --> 57:50.090
And why not me?
It's dangerous.

57:50.175 --> 57:53.010
Santo's not gonna give you
the stuff on credit.

57:53.094 --> 57:55.637
You need money.
So I'll get the money.

57:55.722 --> 57:59.141
Yeah.
 No more penny ante shit with Hank, I'll tell you that.

57:59.225 --> 58:04.146
Listen, I was thinking
maybe, uh...

58:05.565 --> 58:09.276
when you get out,
we could go to the country and live.

58:09.360 --> 58:11.111
The country?

58:13.364 --> 58:15.449
Sure. And eat nuts?

58:16.409 --> 58:17.993
I don't know, man.

58:19.537 --> 58:22.414
I'm letting Hank
work for me.

58:22.499 --> 58:25.459
Hank wanted
to come today.
Yeah, well, fuck him.

58:25.543 --> 58:27.794
If it wasn't for him
and his big-deal fucking caper,

58:27.879 --> 58:31.048
I'd be on the street now, married.

58:31.132 --> 58:34.009
He got back and saw the cop.
There was nothing he could do.

58:34.093 --> 58:36.887
He could get me out of here.
He's trying.

58:37.931 --> 58:40.516
His lawyer's working on it.

58:40.600 --> 58:42.935
Meanwhile,
I'm playing with myself.

58:48.191 --> 58:50.859
I-It's bad outside.
Yeah?

58:50.944 --> 58:53.195
There's nothing.

58:53.279 --> 58:56.782
Narcs aren't even busting anyone,
there's so little around.

58:59.536 --> 59:02.079
I think about you all the time.

59:03.623 --> 59:05.749
Really.

59:05.833 --> 59:08.502
When you're clean,
that's all you can think about.

59:10.255 --> 59:12.214
I can't stop myself.

59:13.841 --> 59:17.010
I think about that first time
we made it together.

59:18.221 --> 59:23.350
I can let it go for two hours
just thinking about that one time.

59:24.310 --> 59:28.063
I go to the chaplain.
I tell him I've got dirty thoughts.

59:28.147 --> 59:30.983
You go to the chaplain?

59:31.067 --> 59:33.652
I know. It's a change.
It breaks the routine.

59:33.736 --> 59:37.155
You make me laugh.

59:37.240 --> 59:39.074
You know what you make me?

59:40.201 --> 59:42.494
Do you want to know
what you really make me?

59:42.579 --> 59:44.746
Listen, uh, I gotta go.

59:44.831 --> 59:46.665
No, don't go. Don't go.

59:49.669 --> 59:52.588
I'm gonna have
all the stuff in Needle Park.

59:57.176 --> 59:59.720
I never wanted anything
but you.

01:00:05.685 --> 01:00:07.352
I want you so bad.

01:01:11.626 --> 01:01:13.001
Hey, Bobby.

01:01:13.086 --> 01:01:14.795
Oh! Look who's here.

01:01:17.131 --> 01:01:20.467
Did you have
a nice stay?
It was wonderful.

01:01:20.551 --> 01:01:22.219
Only I missed you.

01:01:22.303 --> 01:01:24.221
Were you expecting
Helen?

01:01:24.305 --> 01:01:26.181
That's
none of your business.

01:01:27.308 --> 01:01:29.726
She's shooting $80 a day.

01:01:30.812 --> 01:01:32.229
Oh, yeah?

01:01:34.065 --> 01:01:35.982
Where's she getting it?

01:01:36.067 --> 01:01:37.609
Where do you think?

01:01:45.868 --> 01:01:47.285
Bobby!

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:48.954
You whore!

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:52.040
You've been peddling your ass
all over the West Side.

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:54.960
- You don't understand, Bobby!
- Don't give me that shit!

01:01:57.046 --> 01:02:00.465
You've been shooting it,
and you've been selling it! Huh?

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:04.344
I was gonna marry you!
I was gonna marry a whore!

01:02:04.429 --> 01:02:09.474
You know that?
I was gonna marry a whore!
You're a whore!

01:02:12.311 --> 01:02:14.730
Open the door!

01:02:14.814 --> 01:02:17.149
Open the door, Helen,
or I'll break it down.

01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:19.526
Open the door!

01:02:22.947 --> 01:02:26.241
Helen, open the door,
or I'll break it down.

01:02:26.325 --> 01:02:27.576
No!

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:29.035
Son of a...

01:02:30.163 --> 01:02:31.955
Look at this shit!

01:03:04.864 --> 01:03:06.281
Helen.

01:03:09.410 --> 01:03:10.994
Come on, open the door.

01:03:12.079 --> 01:03:14.456
I won't hit you, Helen.

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:17.083
Come on, open the door.

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:21.296
Helen, I won't hit you.

01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:25.509
Helen?

01:03:28.679 --> 01:03:30.388
Helen?

01:03:34.435 --> 01:03:36.353
Don't hit me.
No, I won't.

01:03:36.437 --> 01:03:39.105
I can't stand
anybody hitting me.

01:04:02.046 --> 01:04:04.673
Why didn't you
come to me, Helen?

01:04:04.757 --> 01:04:06.508
I could have helped you.

01:04:06.592 --> 01:04:08.343
You were gone.

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:12.639
You could have gone to Hank.

01:04:18.771 --> 01:04:20.730
I did. I balled him.

01:04:29.073 --> 01:04:31.157
Why did you tell me that?

01:04:33.411 --> 01:04:36.329
Oh.
I'd rather hook
than ball Hank.

01:04:36.414 --> 01:04:38.331
You shouldn't
have told me that.

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:46.298
Why did you tell me that?

01:04:52.138 --> 01:04:53.680
Ohh...

01:05:02.315 --> 01:05:07.485
Okay, you once said that you wanted
to go to the country, right?

01:05:08.487 --> 01:05:12.282
Well, I don't know how,
but maybe we could‒

01:05:12.366 --> 01:05:14.492
we could go there.

01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:18.163
No more games.

01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:22.584
It was a game.

01:05:22.668 --> 01:05:24.669
It was a game, all right.

01:05:25.838 --> 01:05:27.631
Yeah, no games.

01:05:30.676 --> 01:05:33.136
No games.
No games.

01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:52.447
So that's it, Helen.
It's all set. I'm the supplier.

01:05:52.531 --> 01:05:55.283
Helen, I'm the supplier, man.

01:05:55.368 --> 01:05:58.370
We're gonna have stuff
coming out of our ears.

01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:03.750
Man, I tell ya, I just sat in that car,
and I talked and I talked.

01:06:03.834 --> 01:06:05.835
I said,
don't blow this one, man.

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:10.799
Where you going?
Baby, we don't have
any money.

01:06:10.883 --> 01:06:13.969
What are you talking about?
We're gonna have thousands
and thousands of dollars.

01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:17.180
Not in time to get
either one of us straight today.

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:21.017
I don't want you to do that.

01:06:21.102 --> 01:06:23.061
Just until you score.

01:06:25.898 --> 01:06:28.316
It doesn't mean anything.

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:37.969
I want to, uh, speak to him.

01:07:46.353 --> 01:07:48.396
Sir‒

01:10:49.912 --> 01:10:54.123
They move in,
he gets the ball,
passes it, moves around‒

01:10:54.208 --> 01:10:55.959
Ooh!
Here you go!

01:10:58.545 --> 01:11:01.422
We win.

01:11:15.813 --> 01:11:17.647
Is that all there is?

01:11:19.441 --> 01:11:21.859
No, man, I got more.
Don't worry.

01:11:22.987 --> 01:11:25.863
Is Santo gonna
give you another piece?
Yeah.

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:27.448
Yeah.

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:33.329
I've got some stashed,
Helen, just in case.

01:11:34.206 --> 01:11:36.040
In case of what?

01:11:37.209 --> 01:11:39.627
What's the matter with you, man?
In case I get busted.

01:11:39.712 --> 01:11:43.881
I'm gonna need this stuff
to raise money for a lawyer.

01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:45.717
I gotta tell you that?

01:11:52.224 --> 01:11:54.017
Silence, Hank.

01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:57.228
Would you
like to ball him?

01:11:58.397 --> 01:11:59.897
Maybe.

01:12:12.036 --> 01:12:13.745
I think I'm gonna go.

01:12:14.913 --> 01:12:16.581
I got business.

01:12:36.685 --> 01:12:38.061
Fuck!

01:12:44.276 --> 01:12:46.569
You! You boosted it!

01:12:46.653 --> 01:12:49.822
- Bobby, I didn't know where it was.
- I had a whole stash!

01:12:49.907 --> 01:12:51.699
You could have told‒
I told you!

01:12:51.784 --> 01:12:54.327
You could've told Chico or Hank
you were playing the big businessman.

01:12:54.411 --> 01:12:57.121
Santo won't give me another piece!
I don't have any money!

01:12:57.206 --> 01:12:59.707
Could we please talk
about something else for a change?

01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:01.876
I don't have any money!

01:13:36.161 --> 01:13:38.746
You awake?

01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:46.879
What are you crying for?
Nothing.

01:13:47.923 --> 01:13:50.174
Then cut it out.
I don't like it.

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:59.934
You know, sometimes I think
you don't want me to do anything.

01:14:00.018 --> 01:14:01.936
You know that?

01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:04.689
It hasn't made things
any better, has it?

01:14:04.773 --> 01:14:07.442
What do you mean, it hasn't?

01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:10.778
You make all this money,
but we still never have any.
I got big, man.

01:14:10.863 --> 01:14:13.990
You're doing it all for us,
but we never see each other.

01:14:15.993 --> 01:14:17.535
I mean...

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:20.580
look at me.

01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:26.544
Stop talking like my old lady, man.

01:14:34.428 --> 01:14:36.929
Oh, God.

01:14:45.939 --> 01:14:47.690
You by yourself?

01:15:02.581 --> 01:15:04.582
You aren't gonna talk to me, huh?

01:15:06.084 --> 01:15:07.710
You got it.

01:15:09.922 --> 01:15:11.756
You're coming down,
aren't you?

01:15:14.259 --> 01:15:17.136
What's it like being a cop?

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:26.896
Well, we busted a guy the other day.
Took about an hour to find the tracks.

01:15:27.814 --> 01:15:30.399
He was shooting in his privates.
You know what I mean?

01:15:35.906 --> 01:15:38.407
Did that pretty much
do it for you?

01:15:40.911 --> 01:15:42.453
Hey, Helen.

01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:24.287
Not now. Ten minutes.

01:16:24.371 --> 01:16:26.664
I've got a trick.

01:16:26.748 --> 01:16:28.332
We need the bread.

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:31.168
Why here, man?
Ten minutes.

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:42.930
She puts me through
these changes.

01:16:45.892 --> 01:16:47.393
Go fuck yourself.

01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:51.022
That's Samuels.

01:16:52.482 --> 01:16:53.774
U-E-L-S.

01:16:53.859 --> 01:16:56.527
Yeah, Samuels.

01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:02.825
How much money was involved,
Mr. Samuels?

01:17:02.909 --> 01:17:04.952
Seventy-five dollars.
It was in my wallet.

01:17:05.037 --> 01:17:08.497
She took it out
when I was in the bathroom.

01:17:09.708 --> 01:17:12.835
Why were you
in the suspect's room?
We went up to get a couple drinks.

01:17:17.883 --> 01:17:20.134
There is no room service at the Martel.

01:17:24.264 --> 01:17:26.724
- Marty.
- Yeah?

01:17:36.401 --> 01:17:38.069
What's the story?

01:17:39.363 --> 01:17:43.324
The chick took him for 75 bucks,
which we did find in her purse.

01:17:44.951 --> 01:17:46.744
Let me have her.

01:17:46.828 --> 01:17:49.205
She's been whoring
all over the West Side.

01:17:49.289 --> 01:17:51.791
I know, but I need her
for something else.

01:17:51.875 --> 01:17:54.543
She turns you on?
It's a favor, Marty.

01:17:55.921 --> 01:17:59.131
Okay.
Then you handle the john.
All right.

01:18:02.219 --> 01:18:04.845
I was scared. Really scared.

01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:07.932
You're a hooker.
You get busted.

01:18:08.016 --> 01:18:12.144
Anyway, I say that you're not busted
till they put you in the tank.

01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:14.188
What you got there
was just paperwork.

01:18:14.272 --> 01:18:16.982
What happened?
Did they clean you out?

01:18:17.067 --> 01:18:18.818
Hmm? Oh, no.

01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:22.571
What are you doing,
holding out on me?

01:18:28.954 --> 01:18:33.457
You know how old I was
the first time I got busted? Nine.

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:35.960
Stealing rubbers in a drugstore.

01:18:36.044 --> 01:18:38.879
I told the cop
they was for Hank.

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:43.300
You got a letter.

01:18:54.938 --> 01:18:56.689
Who's it from?

01:18:57.941 --> 01:19:00.776
My mother.
Oh, yeah?
Any bread?

01:19:07.159 --> 01:19:08.743
What'd she write you, a book?

01:19:09.828 --> 01:19:11.871
Oh, sh...

01:19:11.955 --> 01:19:13.456
What's the matter?

01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:19.086
Some friends of hers are coming.
She wants me to see them.

01:19:19.171 --> 01:19:21.130
So see them.

01:19:22.132 --> 01:19:24.216
No, I don't--
No, see them.

01:19:24.301 --> 01:19:25.926
No, I don't--

01:19:26.011 --> 01:19:27.803
For bread.

01:21:09.239 --> 01:21:11.532
- Hey, what's happening?
- Hi.

01:21:11.616 --> 01:21:13.367
You ready?

01:21:13.451 --> 01:21:15.119
Almost.

01:21:15.203 --> 01:21:16.662
Good.

01:21:18.164 --> 01:21:20.374
You look great,
man.
I do?

01:21:20.458 --> 01:21:22.418
Yeah.

01:21:22.502 --> 01:21:24.503
Would you get my coat?

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:33.596
Oh, where'd you get
that ribbon?

01:21:34.556 --> 01:21:37.141
You like it?
Looks great.
Terrific.

01:21:38.101 --> 01:21:41.270
Listen, baby,
don't push it, all right?

01:21:41.354 --> 01:21:43.731
No.
Let them come to you.

01:21:43.815 --> 01:21:46.483
Okay.
How do you feel?

01:21:46.568 --> 01:21:48.485
Want me to go
downstairs with you?
Please.

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:50.613
All right, let's go.

01:21:54.826 --> 01:21:57.202
- A little bit longer, darling.
- Just shut up.

01:21:57.287 --> 01:22:00.247
We're gonna be
in Fort Lauderdale‒
Get out of here.

01:22:00.332 --> 01:22:02.583
There's Bobby.
Bobby!

01:22:02.667 --> 01:22:04.835
Come here.

01:22:05.837 --> 01:22:08.380
What's happening?
If you're looking for Helen,
she's using Marcie's.

01:22:08.465 --> 01:22:10.299
Yeah, that's right.

01:22:10.383 --> 01:22:13.344
She got all dressed up to go downtown.
What's she doing at Marcie's place?

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:15.512
Oh, come off it.

01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:18.015
She put on a hair ribbon
to do that, right?

01:22:18.099 --> 01:22:20.059
Don't he know?

01:22:24.147 --> 01:22:25.481
Your first time?

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:29.026
No.
Why, did it seem like it?

01:22:31.029 --> 01:22:32.529
No.

01:22:33.907 --> 01:22:35.449
It was great.

01:23:18.451 --> 01:23:20.869
Uh, listen, I, um‒

01:23:20.954 --> 01:23:23.706
I gotta be out of here
in eight minutes.

01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:26.917
Oh.
I have an appointment too.

01:23:29.504 --> 01:23:31.755
Could you put this out?
Sure.

01:24:19.554 --> 01:24:21.889
Open this door, Helen!

01:24:28.772 --> 01:24:32.149
Ten minutes.
Let me in.
Come on, for Christ's sake.

01:24:35.612 --> 01:24:38.072
What now?
You didn't go, right?

01:24:40.158 --> 01:24:41.658
What's this?

01:24:43.161 --> 01:24:44.661
Huh?

01:24:49.209 --> 01:24:51.210
- That's my wife.
- I...

01:24:51.294 --> 01:24:54.088
You've been having, uh,
assignation with my wife?

01:24:57.509 --> 01:24:59.259
Huh?
I'm sorry.

01:24:59.344 --> 01:25:00.969
I oughta kill you.

01:25:03.890 --> 01:25:05.766
How'd you like it
I balled your mother?

01:25:05.850 --> 01:25:08.185
I-I'm sorry.
You're sorry?

01:25:08.269 --> 01:25:11.021
Listen, I didn't know.
You didn't know?

01:25:12.190 --> 01:25:14.775
Get out of here.
Go ball your governess.

01:25:22.867 --> 01:25:26.453
20, 40, 50, 60.

01:25:32.293 --> 01:25:34.962
Come on, honey.
Get away from here.

01:25:35.046 --> 01:25:37.714
What are you grabbing?

01:25:59.487 --> 01:26:01.446
It's been a long time.

01:26:03.491 --> 01:26:05.033
Since what?

01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:09.705
Since we laughed
about anything.

01:26:09.789 --> 01:26:11.957
Yeah, well‒

01:26:12.041 --> 01:26:13.792
Well, Fun City, you know?

01:26:20.633 --> 01:26:22.259
No more fighting.

01:26:41.738 --> 01:26:44.156
I like this one.
How much is he?

01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:46.450
Fifty dollars.
Fifty dollars?

01:26:46.534 --> 01:26:49.536
It's little.
It's not gonna eat that much.

01:26:49.621 --> 01:26:53.373
Fifty dollars for that?
Come on. Come on.

01:26:53.458 --> 01:26:55.876
What is it, a male or female?
What difference
does it make?

01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:59.046
Well, it was a male
this morning.
So was I.

01:27:01.633 --> 01:27:04.218
Please?
Oh, if you beg,
of course.

01:27:06.554 --> 01:27:09.890
There you are. Take care.

01:27:12.477 --> 01:27:16.313
He's found a bone.
Come on.
Look at that dog.

01:27:16.397 --> 01:27:19.483
Hey, Skip.
No, this dog's
not a Skip.

01:27:20.485 --> 01:27:22.486
Come on, Rocky.

01:27:22.570 --> 01:27:24.279
Sounds like a prizefighter.

01:27:24.364 --> 01:27:26.823
Hey, are you a prizefighter, huh?

01:27:32.497 --> 01:27:34.248
This what you want?
Mmm.

01:27:35.166 --> 01:27:38.293
No more hooking.
We'll make out.

01:27:41.547 --> 01:27:43.757
Coming down?
Yeah.

01:27:44.634 --> 01:27:46.843
Let's wait till
we get Rocky home.

01:27:48.846 --> 01:27:51.598
We'll wait. We'll wait.

01:28:02.110 --> 01:28:03.694
How are you?

01:28:07.949 --> 01:28:10.409
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:28:11.286 --> 01:28:14.037
Yeah. A fresh start.

01:28:19.627 --> 01:28:21.545
Maybe we ought to move.

01:28:23.423 --> 01:28:26.258
Get an extra room for the dog.

01:28:28.553 --> 01:28:30.387
Out of Needle Park.

01:28:32.056 --> 01:28:33.849
That's where I live,
Helen.

01:28:36.227 --> 01:28:39.229
You know?
We'll stay there.

01:28:49.073 --> 01:28:50.741
Let's get off, man.

01:28:54.162 --> 01:28:56.079
Wait.
No.

01:28:58.082 --> 01:29:01.251
I don't want you coming down
when I'm up, all right?

01:29:05.089 --> 01:29:06.631
Where?

01:29:06.716 --> 01:29:08.759
The men's room.
Come on.

01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:27.569
Come on.

01:29:54.847 --> 01:29:57.224
Come on, get him out.

01:29:57.308 --> 01:29:59.893
No, Bobby.
Get him out.

01:29:59.977 --> 01:30:01.728
Come on.
No, please.

01:30:01.813 --> 01:30:03.647
Stay here. Stay with him.

01:30:03.731 --> 01:30:05.774
Shh.

01:31:29.066 --> 01:31:33.320
Hey, where's Rocky?
Where's the champ, huh?

01:31:33.404 --> 01:31:35.238
What's the matter?

01:31:40.328 --> 01:31:42.913
What happened, man?

01:31:54.258 --> 01:31:57.344
What's the matter?

01:31:58.638 --> 01:32:00.013
What happened?

01:32:04.393 --> 01:32:06.770
You can stay here
if you like.

01:32:12.401 --> 01:32:14.736
I'm going to Mexico
pretty soon.

01:32:20.785 --> 01:32:23.787
You've been through
some changes since I saw you.

01:32:30.586 --> 01:32:33.213
And now you want
to wipe all that out.

01:32:39.136 --> 01:32:41.388
You could if you wanted to.

01:33:14.005 --> 01:33:16.006
I gotta talk to you.

01:33:17.341 --> 01:33:18.800
Yeah?

01:33:19.844 --> 01:33:21.845
Where'd you go?

01:33:22.972 --> 01:33:24.180
Marco's.

01:33:25.766 --> 01:33:27.559
I figured that.

01:33:32.690 --> 01:33:34.357
What, did you ball him?

01:33:45.202 --> 01:33:46.786
You didn't?

01:33:47.538 --> 01:33:49.122
No.

01:33:53.044 --> 01:33:55.378
I thought
you'd never come back.

01:34:09.226 --> 01:34:11.061
I couldn't stay.

01:34:58.526 --> 01:35:00.110
That's my wake-up.

01:35:01.779 --> 01:35:04.656
You stole my wake-up.
Bobby, I needed it.

01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:06.866
I take you back,
and you steal my wake-up?

01:35:06.951 --> 01:35:09.202
I was gonna score for you.
You're supposed
to love me.

01:35:09.286 --> 01:35:12.622
I love you. I was gonna
go out and score for you.

01:35:12.707 --> 01:35:15.208
Give it to me!

01:35:15.292 --> 01:35:18.044
I love you.
If you love me,
give it to me!

01:35:18.129 --> 01:35:20.839
You fuck!

01:35:20.923 --> 01:35:22.966
Jesus!
Now neither of us has any!

01:35:25.010 --> 01:35:27.429
What seems to be the trouble?

01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:30.098
Well, I have a kidney stone.

01:35:30.182 --> 01:35:34.894
I was gonna get an operation,
but I didn't want
to leave the kids alone.

01:35:34.979 --> 01:35:37.355
Mm-hmm.
What about your husband?
Couldn't he help?

01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:39.691
We're divorced.
He's living in Pittsburgh.

01:35:39.775 --> 01:35:42.819
He's got a new wife,
and she doesn't like kids.

01:35:45.156 --> 01:35:47.866
Don't you have
a doctor of your own?
He died.

01:35:49.034 --> 01:35:52.454
His nurse told me, uh,
that I needed a prescription
for the medicine.

01:35:52.538 --> 01:35:54.539
That's why I came here.

01:35:56.292 --> 01:35:59.127
For a kidney stone?
It hurts.

01:36:07.178 --> 01:36:10.263
Mrs. Rogers, are you an addict?

01:36:10.347 --> 01:36:12.724
No.

01:36:17.563 --> 01:36:19.564
Mrs. Rogers?

01:36:22.359 --> 01:36:24.235
Please?

01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:26.029
I need something.

01:36:29.074 --> 01:36:30.700
Please.

01:36:59.563 --> 01:37:01.564
I can't give you
a prescription.

01:37:07.321 --> 01:37:08.905
Here.

01:37:09.824 --> 01:37:12.325
Now,
don't hit me again.
No.

01:37:12.409 --> 01:37:15.245
Please?
No. Thank you.

01:37:19.041 --> 01:37:21.042
Did you have
to trick him?

01:37:24.046 --> 01:37:27.173
I've been tricking a doctor
for three weeks just to get some.

01:37:27.258 --> 01:37:29.884
He don't give me money, just pills.

01:37:32.179 --> 01:37:34.097
Took four.

01:37:38.394 --> 01:37:40.812
Gonna sell the rest.

01:37:44.733 --> 01:37:47.402
Pushing pills.

01:37:48.612 --> 01:37:51.948
Bobby's playing king of the mountain,
and you're pushing pills to kids.

01:38:23.314 --> 01:38:26.024
You ever been
in a house of detention, Helen?

01:38:27.568 --> 01:38:29.319
Heard about it? Seen it?

01:38:32.364 --> 01:38:33.740
It's like a zoo.

01:38:37.161 --> 01:38:40.747
Those diesels,
when they see a cute chick like you,
they're not gonna screw around.

01:38:40.831 --> 01:38:43.750
They're gonna take your brains out,
scramble 'em and have you for breakfast.

01:38:43.834 --> 01:38:45.585
You having fun?

01:38:51.508 --> 01:38:53.843
I think I'm going to do you
a little favor, Helen.

01:38:56.180 --> 01:39:01.643
I got a friend who works in the DA's office.
Think I'm gonna have this fixed for you.

01:39:09.526 --> 01:39:10.777
Hi.

01:39:10.861 --> 01:39:14.280
That didn't take long, did it?
But that's only a pretrial.

01:39:14.365 --> 01:39:16.783
You still got a hearing
next month.

01:39:24.333 --> 01:39:27.335
You sure do know
the right people.

01:39:27.419 --> 01:39:29.003
No, you do.

01:39:35.678 --> 01:39:37.220
I want Santo.

01:39:38.389 --> 01:39:41.182
I've never even seen him.

01:39:42.393 --> 01:39:45.353
Can't help you.
Then you're gonna
have to give me Bobby.

01:39:46.730 --> 01:39:48.189
No.

01:39:48.273 --> 01:39:50.900
How did you like it in there
last night, Helen?

01:39:52.403 --> 01:39:53.987
I won't.

01:39:54.071 --> 01:39:56.781
You're sitting
on a one-to-three.

01:39:56.865 --> 01:39:59.826
That's a long time
without any shit.

01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:04.205
You give me Bobby,
and you'll go free.

01:40:04.289 --> 01:40:07.625
Bobby knows what the game is.
He won't do more than six months.

01:40:08.836 --> 01:40:10.586
He'll give me Santo.

01:40:13.465 --> 01:40:14.966
Look...

01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:18.344
I'll give you Sammy,
Sonny, anyone‒

01:40:18.429 --> 01:40:21.097
You rat up,
you don't rat down.

01:40:24.351 --> 01:40:25.935
I can't.

01:40:27.021 --> 01:40:28.438
I want Santo.

01:40:31.191 --> 01:40:34.819
There isn't any stuff around.
Bobby's not gonna see Santo.

01:40:34.903 --> 01:40:38.197
There's a new shipment
all over Harlem.

01:40:38.282 --> 01:40:40.116
It'll be downtown.

01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:46.039
That's the game that you're playing, Helen.
I didn't make the rules.

01:40:50.794 --> 01:40:53.463
You son of a bitch!

01:41:07.853 --> 01:41:10.980
Seen Bobby?
No, he ain't around.

01:41:14.318 --> 01:41:16.319
It's all over, baby.

01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:20.239
No more panic.

01:41:20.324 --> 01:41:21.616
What happened?

01:41:23.327 --> 01:41:25.244
Your old man,

01:41:25.329 --> 01:41:27.246
he's got an acre of it.

01:41:27.331 --> 01:41:30.083
Straight out of
Philadelphia, man.

01:41:30.167 --> 01:41:33.419
Oh, man, three pieces.

01:41:33.504 --> 01:41:35.713
Baby, we're in, man, we're in.

01:41:35.798 --> 01:41:37.799
No more pushing pills, right?

01:41:40.385 --> 01:41:42.011
Do you love me?

01:41:43.889 --> 01:41:45.556
Hmm?
I love you.

01:41:48.852 --> 01:41:50.812
I got people
working for me now, Helen.

01:41:50.896 --> 01:41:53.314
I just sit there
and count the bread.

01:41:53.398 --> 01:41:54.982
Say you love me.

01:41:55.067 --> 01:41:57.193
You know, Santo said...

01:41:57.277 --> 01:42:00.822
he's gonna give me
as much as I can sell.

01:42:00.906 --> 01:42:02.990
Huh? You dream
about these things.

01:42:03.075 --> 01:42:04.992
You want to?

01:42:05.077 --> 01:42:08.412
I... really want to.

01:42:08.497 --> 01:42:10.164
All right, baby, all right.

01:42:10.249 --> 01:42:11.874
It's okay. Here.

01:42:18.924 --> 01:42:20.716
I haven't heard from you,
Helen.

01:42:21.552 --> 01:42:22.802
Leave me alone, Hotch.

01:42:22.886 --> 01:42:25.304
You got a case
coming up in two weeks.

01:42:26.223 --> 01:42:27.890
I can't do it.

01:42:27.975 --> 01:42:29.600
You better think about it.

01:42:35.357 --> 01:42:36.941
Baby, baby.

01:42:41.321 --> 01:42:43.739
You're taking too much.
You know that?

01:42:44.575 --> 01:42:47.827
We got plenty.
You don't have to take it all at once.

01:42:53.250 --> 01:42:55.668
What's the matter?

01:42:55.752 --> 01:42:57.128
Hmm?

01:42:58.922 --> 01:43:00.923
You worried about your old lady?

01:43:03.051 --> 01:43:04.594
Is that it?

01:43:07.055 --> 01:43:10.057
If you're worried about her,
why don't you call her?

01:43:11.351 --> 01:43:13.019
Maybe tomorrow.

01:43:17.274 --> 01:43:18.858
I love you.

01:43:19.776 --> 01:43:21.277
That's wonderful.

01:43:22.571 --> 01:43:24.155
That's terrific.

01:43:44.218 --> 01:43:46.177
Hotchner.

01:43:49.890 --> 01:43:51.807
You want to ball me?

01:43:53.852 --> 01:43:56.395
It's not gonna be that easy, Helen.

01:43:58.690 --> 01:43:59.941
I want Bobby.

01:44:05.697 --> 01:44:07.114
Get out of here.

01:44:09.368 --> 01:44:10.743
You've got a week.

01:44:34.851 --> 01:44:36.852
What day is it?

01:44:38.563 --> 01:44:40.273
Wednesday.

01:44:41.525 --> 01:44:43.818
You got a big appointment
or something?

01:44:53.203 --> 01:44:56.205
Helen, I gotta go out
for a couple of hours.

01:44:56.290 --> 01:44:59.333
Why don't you put some clothes on
before Hank comes.

01:44:59.418 --> 01:45:02.586
Don't go.
I gotta go.
I got business.

01:45:02.671 --> 01:45:04.213
Please don't go.

01:45:04.298 --> 01:45:08.467
Baby, what do you want me to do?
Crawl in here and die with you?

01:45:08.552 --> 01:45:11.929
For Christ's sake!
The past three days,
all you're doing is lying here!

01:45:12.014 --> 01:45:14.557
You don't get up,
you don't get dressed!

01:45:14.641 --> 01:45:16.309
I want you to shape up!

01:45:17.853 --> 01:45:21.814
Goddamn it,
I want you to shape up
and get some clothes on!

01:45:21.898 --> 01:45:25.067
You want to give it to Hank,
go outside and do it!

01:46:08.653 --> 01:46:10.321
Hold it, pal.

01:46:21.541 --> 01:46:23.334
Shit.

01:46:23.418 --> 01:46:25.211
Cuff him.

01:46:59.079 --> 01:47:02.748
Cunt! You cunt, you!

01:47:02.833 --> 01:47:06.293
I was going to marry you!
All right, get in!

01:47:54.301 --> 01:47:55.885
Bobby?

01:48:47.479 --> 01:48:49.271
Well?
