Hey, we're still on technology vacation.

I know, but it just sounded so urgent.

01:59.786 --> 02:02.622
I know you two are avoiding
using technology or whatever,

02:02.705 --> 02:03.957
but this is urgent.

02:05.041 --> 02:06.042
Hm.

02:07.919 --> 02:12.465
Okay, we're here. But this better be real,
and not like your last "emergency."

02:12.549 --> 02:15.468
Yeah! Being out of ice cream
is not an emergency!

02:15.552 --> 02:17.262
Unless your prom date left you.

02:17.345 --> 02:18.721
Guys, Tony was taken.

02:18.805 --> 02:21.891
We don't have time to explain.
We need you to meet us outside of LA.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.685
I'm sending coordinates now.

02:23.768 --> 02:26.521
Bring some of that emergency ice cream
if there's any left.

Oh, okay. Well, I'm not the one
who plays a video game

02:52.839 --> 02:55.174
where I pretend to be a submarine captain.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.844
Hey! The Deepening is
more than a video game.

It's like an actual submarine simulator.

Yeah, but still! It's different.

[Layla groans]

03:28.583 --> 03:29.834
-[grunts]
-What's going on?

03:29.918 --> 03:33.880
We were playing a virtual reality game
when stuff got real.

03:33.963 --> 03:35.673
Like, really real.

03:35.757 --> 03:37.842
A plane swooped down and captured Tony.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.552
See? Technology.

03:39.636 --> 03:43.306
Okay. The first thing we gotta do
is figure out who might want to take Tony.

03:43.389 --> 03:45.558
Ooh, ooh! Mitch doesn't like him.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.977
That's true.
Neither does that one General dude.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.145
Or that tattoo guy.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.147
-Or the man-bun guy.
-Or the old guy!

03:51.231 --> 03:53.024
Which old guy are you talking about?

03:53.107 --> 03:55.401
There's a lot of them,
and they all hate Tony.

03:55.485 --> 03:56.736
I dunno. Pick one!

03:56.819 --> 04:01.908
On this one, I'm wondering if we should
call Ms. Nowhere and Palindrome--

04:01.991 --> 04:05.453
Hang on. Let's not forget what Palindrome
always says before going to him:

04:05.536 --> 04:09.123
"Is this an agent-sized problem,
or a Nowhere-sized problem?"

04:09.749 --> 04:10.625
-Agent!
-Nowhere!

04:10.708 --> 04:12.377
I mean, yeah. What you said.

04:13.211 --> 04:17.006
Wait a second. That plane that took Tony
looked almost identical to our spy plane.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.007
That might be good.

04:18.091 --> 04:21.219
Really? Isn't the spy plane
virtually undetectable?

04:21.302 --> 04:24.722
It is. Unless you know
what you're looking for.

04:25.431 --> 04:28.893
Every plane gives off its own signature
based on a combination of

04:28.977 --> 04:30.937
atmospheric disturbance, engine emissions,

04:31.020 --> 04:34.482
rotor dynamics,
and hydraulic bearing switch flexors.

04:34.565 --> 04:37.193
Okay, come on. You made that last one up.

04:37.277 --> 04:40.488
And since the plane that took Tony
is so much like our spy plane,

04:40.571 --> 04:41.698
I can copy our signature

04:41.781 --> 04:44.701
and use the agency satellites
to pinpoint similar readings.

04:45.410 --> 04:49.122
Now, let's see if we can find a match.

04:53.459 --> 04:54.294
There!

04:54.377 --> 04:57.630
It's heading west! Julius,
lock our coordinates onto that plane.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.382
We're getting Tony back.

04:59.465 --> 05:02.176
And solving problems all on our own!

06:35.686 --> 06:37.730
[Echo] I guess
the layout's similar to ours.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.650
They could be holding Tony
down there, in the cargo hold.

06:40.733 --> 06:41.859
Oh, man.

06:41.943 --> 06:45.238
I can't believe we have to rescue Tony
30,000 feet in the air.

06:45.321 --> 06:48.324
-Actually, we're cruising at 38,000 feet.

But that doesn't matter if you're talking
about falling to your death. Were you?

06:52.703 --> 06:55.164
[shakily] Yeah,
that's what I was talking about.

06:55.248 --> 06:58.417
You wouldn't even survive to the ground
because the air's so thin.

-[Frostee] Good news.

07:04.799 --> 07:07.802
A hatch on the belly of the plane
leads right to the cargo hold.

We can sneak in there.

-[twitters]

09:23.271 --> 09:26.023
Well, you know, Mr. Sudarikov, sir,

09:26.107 --> 09:29.860
air sickness can affect anything
that has a central nervous system.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.280
Once your mind receives
conflicting messages,

09:32.363 --> 09:35.950
your body tends to have
a natural, oftentimes unpleasant reaction.

09:36.033 --> 09:38.744
Now, some say this happens
'cause our ancestors,

09:38.828 --> 09:41.163
who used to experience
similar disorientation

Okay, I don't need to know
the whole history of air sickness.

09:47.753 --> 09:50.423
Well, sir, I think you're right on that,

09:50.506 --> 09:54.760
because there might be another explanation
why your dear Strigiformes there

09:54.844 --> 09:55.845
is so upset.

09:55.928 --> 10:01.642
Mayhaps someone got aboard this aircraft
that shouldn't be here.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.894
What? That cannot be.

10:03.978 --> 10:07.732
I lost my old job because
what I thought was an earthquake

10:07.815 --> 10:10.776
had nothing to do with
plate tectonics at all.

10:10.860 --> 10:14.488
If someone's here that shouldn't be,
I'll show 'em the exit.
