01:58.596 --> 02:01.730
[birds chirping]

02:19.400 --> 02:22.838
[man] The day I turned ten,
my father took me hunting for the first time.

02:27.277 --> 02:28.974
[bird squawking]

02:29.018 --> 02:31.542
It was his way of telling me that soon I would be grown up,

02:32.630 --> 02:34.502
his way to teach me about life.

02:37.896 --> 02:39.724
I followed him in silence,

02:39.768 --> 02:42.553
fully aware that
once I fired his rifle,

02:42.597 --> 02:45.339
the innocence of childhood
would be no more.

02:52.563 --> 02:55.218
He was not in a hurry
to kill an animal.

02:55.262 --> 02:58.003
But first, he wanted me to understand the difference

02:58.047 --> 03:00.876
between being a hunter
and being a tracker.

03:12.888 --> 03:14.237
The hunter
kills its prey.

03:15.630 --> 03:17.545
The tracker
understands it.

03:19.068 --> 03:20.374
He blends with nature,

03:21.331 --> 03:23.115
feels its power,

03:23.159 --> 03:24.247
hears its call.

03:26.206 --> 03:29.165
Tracking is
a sacred responsibility.

03:32.690 --> 03:35.476
It finds its origin
in the origin of mankind.

03:37.260 --> 03:39.219
A tracker preserves history.

03:40.307 --> 03:42.222
A hunter destroys it.

03:46.661 --> 03:50.882
But then comes the moment
when both become one.

03:50.926 --> 03:52.710
[heart beating]

03:52.754 --> 03:54.234
That's when he told me,

03:55.757 --> 03:58.455
"This is what it means
to be a man."

03:58.499 --> 04:00.762

[man 2] Hakansson, we have your wife and daughter.

05:37.162 --> 05:40.209
Half a million, if you want to see them alive.

05:40.252 --> 05:44.822
Tonight at 11:00,
Route 39, kilometer 28.

05:44.866 --> 05:47.347
You alone, no police.

05:47.390 --> 05:49.392
No police. You understand?

06:01.622 --> 06:02.753
Get in.

06:02.797 --> 06:04.364
[woman]
Where are you taking us?

06:04.407 --> 06:06.235
[whimpering]

06:09.369 --> 06:10.500
Let me go.

06:13.111 --> 06:14.765
Let me go.[man 2] Get in the car.

[car driving away]

06:44.665 --> 06:45.665
[in Italian] Help.

06:47.581 --> 06:49.887
Help! I feel bad. Help me!

06:56.503 --> 06:57.547
Oh!

Don't worry, baby.

07:31.233 --> 07:32.930
Everything will be all right.

07:32.974 --> 07:34.497
We are going to see Daddy soon.

Did you find them?

11:12.236 --> 11:13.236
Yeah.

11:14.108 --> 11:15.196
We found them this morning.

11:16.327 --> 11:17.502
Where are they?

11:50.144 --> 11:52.581
[man] Mr. Hakansson,
it's Detective Laterza.

11:52.624 --> 11:55.889
I have to see you.
I have information regarding your family.

11:55.932 --> 11:58.543
Meet me at Cafe La Piazzetta in Taranto, Wednesday at 4:00 p.m.

Okay.

13:22.627 --> 13:24.064
Almost there.

13:24.107 --> 13:25.674
About an hour or so?

13:27.894 --> 13:29.852
[chuckles]

13:29.896 --> 13:31.506
Hey, be honest.

13:31.549 --> 13:35.031
How excited are you
that we're about to go live

13:35.075 --> 13:37.817
in a small town
in southern Italy

13:38.818 --> 13:40.210
for two or three years?

13:40.907 --> 13:41.951
Very excited.

13:43.387 --> 13:44.432
Really?

13:44.475 --> 13:45.476
[chuckles] Yeah.

13:45.520 --> 13:46.521
Okay.

14:03.668 --> 14:05.888
Mister Ha-kan-sson.

14:06.933 --> 14:08.021
That's right.

14:08.064 --> 14:09.718
I'm glad you made it.

14:09.761 --> 14:12.155
- A long flight from L.A.
- Yeah.

14:12.199 --> 14:14.331
Right? Yes.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.768
I have all the billing
information I need.

14:17.987 --> 14:19.423
Do you want me
to show you around?

14:19.467 --> 14:21.164
It's a very nice place.

14:21.208 --> 14:22.513
It's okay.Okay.

14:22.557 --> 14:24.341
Just the key, please.Sure.

14:24.385 --> 14:25.623
This is your key. Thanks a lot.

14:25.647 --> 14:27.649
Call me

14:27.692 --> 14:30.173
All right. You can call me
when you want.

14:30.217 --> 14:32.436
I will. Thank you. Thank you so much.

Okay.

15:06.731 --> 15:07.863
You okay?

15:07.907 --> 15:08.951
Yeah.

15:08.995 --> 15:10.257
Nice, huh?

15:12.041 --> 15:13.303
Yeah.

15:17.873 --> 15:19.092
I gotta sit down.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.924
[guitar instrumental continues]

15:27.230 --> 15:28.362
Not bad.

15:28.405 --> 15:29.537
I love it.

15:36.674 --> 15:38.043
I think I could live here
for a while.

15:38.067 --> 15:39.677
[chuckles] Yeah.

15:45.770 --> 15:49.122
Are you not gonna help unpack
for the tired pregnant woman?

15:51.080 --> 15:53.300
I have to carry the babies
and give birth to them.

15:59.741 --> 16:01.830
Thanks for coming with me.

16:01.873 --> 16:05.181
Thought you could just knock me up and
leave me with these two little guys?

16:08.097 --> 16:11.318
Boys? You sure? Is that what you want?

16:14.060 --> 16:15.940
It doesn't matter.
I mean, as long as they're...

16:16.323 --> 16:17.541
Yours.

16:17.585 --> 16:19.108
[laughs]No.

16:19.152 --> 16:20.631
As long as they're healthy.

16:20.675 --> 16:21.850
And mine.

16:29.379 --> 16:30.819
[in Italian]
San Gallo, I'll miss it.

16:31.729 --> 16:32.729
No.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.038
You'll be way happier
where I'm taking you.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.694
One gets fond
of places...

16:40.303 --> 16:42.218
of people.

16:42.262 --> 16:43.262
It's not worth it.

16:44.133 --> 16:46.005
We conquered this place.

16:47.658 --> 16:49.182
But it never welcomed us.

16:51.271 --> 16:53.012
Giordano
is going to betray us.

16:56.711 --> 16:57.755
Do you want me to...

16:58.669 --> 16:59.714
Yes.

17:02.195 --> 17:03.196
Yes.

17:08.375 --> 17:10.203

18:23.972 --> 18:25.060
[in Italian] May I?

18:25.104 --> 18:26.888
Come in.

18:26.931 --> 18:29.369
I'm Commissioner Graziani.

18:29.412 --> 18:31.806
I have a meeting
with Detective Giordano.

18:32.720 --> 18:33.808
He's not here.

18:36.941 --> 18:39.118
Can't you ask someone else,
perhaps?

18:39.814 --> 18:40.815
Thank you.

18:48.257 --> 18:49.389
Sartori?

18:50.651 --> 18:51.869
Yes, he's here.

18:57.048 --> 18:58.746
Just a minute.Thanks.

19:20.202 --> 19:21.334
Leotrim.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.554
Commissario Giordano.

19:26.426 --> 19:28.167
[in English]
Don't be nervous.

19:28.210 --> 19:29.298
Nobody can hear us.

19:30.734 --> 19:33.041
I don't trust fish,
if you ask me.

19:33.084 --> 19:35.739
Well, you can trust me,
Gudon Leotrim.

19:38.873 --> 19:41.092
Don't worry.

19:41.136 --> 19:43.878
I'm not planning to shoot a police officer,
at least not today.

19:46.446 --> 19:48.622
Aren't you forgetting something?

19:48.665 --> 19:53.192
Lupo will get his next shipment
2:00 a.m. on Wednesday.

19:54.062 --> 19:55.803
By land, not by sea.

19:55.846 --> 19:57.152
By land?

19:57.718 --> 19:59.023
Trucks.

19:59.067 --> 20:00.373
What do you suggest?

20:01.809 --> 20:03.941
Wait, they process it,
and you ship it out.

20:05.726 --> 20:07.031
I might just do that.

20:14.343 --> 20:15.343
I will live with that.

20:16.258 --> 20:17.564
That makes the two of us.

20:19.043 --> 20:20.088
Good.

20:21.481 --> 20:22.761
[in Italian]
Are you comfortable?

20:23.352 --> 20:25.136
Graziani? From Torino?

20:25.180 --> 20:26.529
Yes, sir. Follow me.

20:26.573 --> 20:28.096
This is your office.

20:30.446 --> 20:32.231
And what's with the stuff?

20:33.275 --> 20:34.363
Training.

20:34.407 --> 20:35.973
That's called training.

20:36.017 --> 20:37.627
Two or three years
in a place like this,

20:37.671 --> 20:39.586
and you go back home
with a good promotion.

20:39.629 --> 20:41.327
This is your plan, right?

20:41.370 --> 20:44.112
Actually, no.
Excuse me, are you mad at me, by any chance?

20:44.155 --> 20:45.766
Yes. Welcome to Taranto.

20:46.375 --> 20:47.681
Good work.

20:47.724 --> 20:49.117
Go fuck yours...

20:49.160 --> 20:52.294
Excuse me? No, I mean, "Go for it."

20:55.297 --> 20:57.473
[sighs] What a great start.

21:23.717 --> 21:24.797
[in Italian]
He didn't move.

21:40.821 --> 21:42.344
Bye. Bye, man.

21:45.739 --> 21:47.859
[waitress, in English] I'm sorry, sir. We're closing.

21:48.394 --> 21:49.656
[in English]
Excuse me. Um...

21:51.962 --> 21:54.661
Do you happen to know
a Detective Laterza?

21:57.228 --> 21:59.100
Is that who
you were waiting for?

21:59.143 --> 22:00.144
Yeah.

22:03.713 --> 22:06.063
He committed suicide
four days ago.

22:10.720 --> 22:11.720
Are you sure?

22:12.374 --> 22:13.506
I'm sorry.

22:17.945 --> 22:19.033
Okay.

22:23.864 --> 22:25.039
Do you know where he lived?

22:26.736 --> 22:28.216
The last house
on the street.

23:44.205 --> 23:45.554
[motorcycle engine starts]

23:50.733 --> 23:51.733
[man] Hey.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.476
There he is.

23:54.520 --> 23:55.520
Ciao, love.

23:56.522 --> 23:58.001
Oh, you look exhausted.

23:58.045 --> 23:59.873
[sighs] I am.

23:59.916 --> 24:02.615
You can't imagine
the day I had today.

24:03.572 --> 24:04.965
That bad?

24:05.008 --> 24:06.445
Did you solve
a big case?

24:10.536 --> 24:12.015
Wanna see my battle wounds?

24:12.059 --> 24:13.277
Yeah.Yeah.

24:15.149 --> 24:16.455
[heavy exhale]

24:17.456 --> 24:18.587
Okay.

24:18.631 --> 24:21.155
[grunts] Look.

24:22.765 --> 24:23.810
Look at that.

24:24.550 --> 24:26.377
No gunshots here.

24:27.553 --> 24:28.641
Look at this.

24:29.293 --> 24:30.293
Mm-hmm...

24:32.166 --> 24:33.472
I think this is a paper cut.

24:34.690 --> 24:37.737
And there's
a carpal tunnel here.

24:37.780 --> 24:39.347
[laughs]Paperwork.

24:41.001 --> 24:42.176
What are you reading?

24:43.482 --> 24:44.526
All right, listen to this.

24:46.702 --> 24:49.270
"April is
the cruelest month, breeding,

24:49.313 --> 24:52.491
Lilacs out of
the dead land, mixing,

24:52.534 --> 24:55.102
Memory and desire, stirring,

24:55.145 --> 24:56.843
Dull roots with spring rain."

24:58.671 --> 25:00.716
Does he know who you are?

25:00.760 --> 25:04.503
He's dead.
And has been for a long time.

25:04.546 --> 25:06.635
He's writing
about the month of April.

25:07.984 --> 25:09.246
I'm happy he's dead.

25:11.466 --> 25:14.121
I want our kids
to know good poetry.

25:14.164 --> 25:15.818
That's why
you married a cop.

25:15.862 --> 25:17.167
A jealous cop.

25:17.211 --> 25:18.517
[both chuckle]

25:18.560 --> 25:19.822
Close your eyes.

25:19.866 --> 25:21.041
Why?

25:21.084 --> 25:22.521
I'm gonna make you happy.

25:22.564 --> 25:24.523
Hmm. Close them.

25:24.566 --> 25:25.785
Okay.

25:30.398 --> 25:32.008
It's not gonna hurt, right? No.

25:34.097 --> 25:35.229
Open.

25:36.883 --> 25:39.625
Drink it quietly.
I am going to bed.

25:39.668 --> 25:42.105
[exhales] Thank you.

25:45.892 --> 25:49.156
Did I ever tell you
that I love you?

25:49.199 --> 25:50.244
[in Italian] Yes, I know.

26:11.091 --> 26:13.093
[dramatic music playing]

26:34.549 --> 26:35.768
[grunts]

26:39.946 --> 26:41.251
[in English]
What are you doing?

26:41.295 --> 26:43.297
Why are you following me, huh?

26:43.340 --> 26:46.474
[straining] Why?
Why are you following me?

26:46.953 --> 26:48.171
Huh?

26:48.215 --> 26:49.584
[in Italian]
I don't understand you.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.566
[in English]
Why? Who are...

26:51.610 --> 26:53.089
[grunting]

27:04.971 --> 27:06.146
Signore.

27:06.189 --> 27:09.105
Excuse me, where's the police?

27:10.019 --> 27:11.194
[in Italian] Police?

27:11.238 --> 27:12.238
[in English] This way?

27:14.284 --> 27:15.634
[Sartori] Graziani!

27:15.677 --> 27:16.983
[sighs]

27:17.026 --> 27:19.463
Graziani![in Italian]
Yes, I'm coming.

27:20.900 --> 27:21.988
[sighs]

27:30.170 --> 27:31.867
[Sartori, in Italian]
Do you speak English?

27:31.911 --> 27:33.521
[Graziani] Yes.[Sartori] Come, come.

27:33.564 --> 27:35.044
Mister Hakansson,
an old friend.

27:37.133 --> 27:38.395
Graziani.

27:38.439 --> 27:41.137
Ask him why
he came back to our city.

27:41.181 --> 27:43.701
[in English] He would like to know
why you came back in our city.

27:44.924 --> 27:47.709
Because Detective Laterza
called me

27:47.753 --> 27:49.624
and said he had some news
about the kidnapping.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.887
[speaking Italian]

27:53.367 --> 27:55.761
[speaking Italian]

27:55.804 --> 27:58.241
[in English]
Laterza committed suicide.

27:58.285 --> 28:00.679
[speaking Italian]

28:02.158 --> 28:04.421
[in English]
He says that he went crazy

28:04.465 --> 28:07.120
and started believing
in conspiracy theories.

28:07.163 --> 28:10.601
[speaking Italian]

28:10.645 --> 28:13.909
[in English] And he started reopening a
whole bunch of cases, including yours.

28:15.955 --> 28:18.435
So why did this kid
pull a gun on me today?

28:19.045 --> 28:20.220
Who?

28:20.263 --> 28:21.961
This young guy,
a 20-year-old guy,

28:22.004 --> 28:23.136
pulled a gun on me.

28:23.179 --> 28:26.052
[speaking Italian]

28:26.095 --> 28:30.709
[speaking Italian]

28:30.752 --> 28:32.972
[in English] He says he was
probably trying to rob you.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.673
[speaking Italian]

28:40.457 --> 28:43.025
[in English] He thinks that
your case is unsolved,

28:43.069 --> 28:44.940
and it's impossible to close it.

28:50.816 --> 28:53.427
Can I speak
to Detective Giordano?

28:53.470 --> 28:56.169
He was the one
who had my case originally.

28:56.212 --> 28:57.300
Giordano?

28:57.344 --> 28:59.085
[speaking Italian]

29:00.608 --> 29:02.741
[in English] Giordano took
a couple of days off.

29:03.611 --> 29:09.269
[speaking Italian]

29:09.312 --> 29:12.881
[in English] He says that he knows how you
feel, but he can't do anything for you.

29:12.925 --> 29:16.667
[speaking Italian]

29:21.498 --> 29:27.113
[in English] He says that he has
your fingerprints on an illegal gun.

29:27.940 --> 29:31.595
[speaking Italian]

29:31.639 --> 29:33.559
[in English] It's not good,
and you should leave.

29:38.602 --> 29:39.690
I'm sorry.

29:41.214 --> 29:42.214
Thanks.

29:42.911 --> 29:43.912
Nice to meet you.

29:48.221 --> 29:50.068
[in Italian] Would you tell
me what the fuck is going on?

29:50.092 --> 29:53.269
Ten years ago, they killed
his wife and daughter.

29:53.313 --> 29:55.794
So he comes back after ten years,
and we do nothing to help him?

29:55.837 --> 29:58.405
Graziani. We didn't manage to
close the case ten years ago.

29:58.448 --> 30:00.233
You think you can solve it now?

30:00.276 --> 30:02.713
Who do you think you are?
Sherlock Holmes? Go back to work.

30:02.757 --> 30:04.117
Yeah, I get it,
but the poor guy...

30:13.028 --> 30:14.073
Shit.

30:17.511 --> 30:18.425
[in English]
Hey, honey.

30:18.468 --> 30:19.600
Hey.

30:19.643 --> 30:20.819
Smells delicious.

30:20.862 --> 30:22.385
Another exciting day
at the office?

30:23.473 --> 30:25.867
[exhales] Kind of.

30:25.911 --> 30:28.391
I learned how to cook
a new dish.

30:28.435 --> 30:30.741
Oh, my God.
Should I start worrying?

30:30.785 --> 30:32.308
No.[laughs]

30:49.282 --> 30:50.457
Are you coming?

30:50.500 --> 30:51.675
Yeah.

30:51.719 --> 30:52.763
Yeah, give me a second.

31:00.684 --> 31:01.729
Hey. You want water?

31:02.382 --> 31:03.644
Yeah, thank you.

31:03.687 --> 31:04.863
Hey.Hi.

31:08.475 --> 31:09.755
[man, in Italian]
Did he see you?

31:14.524 --> 31:16.048
I asked if he saw you.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.576
I beg you, Lupo.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.101
What are you begging me for?

31:28.190 --> 31:30.070
Certainly you don't think
I'm going to kill you?

31:31.585 --> 31:33.239
You are like
a son to me.

31:35.067 --> 31:37.025
One who failed,

31:38.548 --> 31:39.767
but still, a son.

32:35.170 --> 32:36.867
[dramatic music playing]

33:20.563 --> 33:23.218
[grunting]

33:31.705 --> 33:32.706
[distant gunfire]

33:33.620 --> 33:34.969
Hey, are you all right?

33:37.363 --> 33:38.712
[grunting]

33:40.801 --> 33:42.020
[groans]

33:45.458 --> 33:46.807
[grunts]

33:46.850 --> 33:47.938
[muffled gunshot]

33:59.559 --> 34:00.559
[muffled gunshot]

34:08.176 --> 34:10.047
[breathing heavily]

34:22.538 --> 34:24.322
[cell phone ringtone:
upbeat music]

34:25.324 --> 34:26.629
[Graziani sighs]

34:29.937 --> 34:31.547
[in Italian]
What the fuck?

34:31.591 --> 34:32.940
[musical ringtone continues]

34:35.551 --> 34:36.639
Yeah?

34:39.033 --> 34:40.643
[sighs] Okay.

34:40.687 --> 34:41.687
Yes.

34:43.342 --> 34:44.429
[in English] Honey.

34:49.739 --> 34:51.567
What's happening?

34:51.610 --> 34:53.830
I'm sorry, honey.
It's something I have to do, okay?

34:55.440 --> 34:56.572
[sighs] I gotta go.

34:57.530 --> 34:59.793
[police radio chatter]

35:08.671 --> 35:09.671
[in Italian] Take this.

35:13.633 --> 35:14.634
There's the new guy.

35:27.473 --> 35:28.996
New commissioner?

35:29.039 --> 35:30.147
Antonio Graziani,
a pleasure.

35:30.171 --> 35:31.171
Giordano.

35:34.697 --> 35:35.742
What a mess.

35:43.445 --> 35:44.707
Where
do we start from?

35:44.751 --> 35:46.144
Yeah, where
do we start from?

36:12.822 --> 36:14.346
[grunting]

36:17.740 --> 36:19.438
[panting]

36:29.317 --> 36:31.885
Excuse me,
who did you rent it to?

36:31.928 --> 36:34.148
He was about 50,
a foreigner.

36:36.237 --> 36:37.456
Hakansson.

36:39.893 --> 36:41.242
Yeah, okay,
but what do I do now?

36:43.940 --> 36:45.115
Call the insurance company.

36:46.291 --> 36:47.553
Call the what?

36:48.815 --> 36:49.815
What now?

36:51.905 --> 36:53.036
Now it's war.

38:12.028 --> 38:13.334
[muffled gunshot]

38:37.358 --> 38:38.707
Psst. Psst!

39:08.215 --> 39:09.825
[in Italian]
Good evening.

39:09.869 --> 39:12.785
Sorry for the late hour.
We're looking for a thief.

39:12.828 --> 39:14.352
I didn't hear anything.

39:15.614 --> 39:16.919
[officer] All right.

39:16.963 --> 39:19.792
Call me if you see
anything suspicious.

39:19.835 --> 39:21.097
Sure.

39:21.141 --> 39:23.230
Thank you. Good night. Good night.

39:42.641 --> 39:43.761
[in English]
Come in, please.

39:46.209 --> 39:47.254
Who are you?

39:47.950 --> 39:49.430
Ray Martin.

39:49.474 --> 39:52.346
I moved here from England
quite some time ago.

39:53.303 --> 39:54.870
Lovely town most of the time.

39:58.352 --> 39:59.352
Care for one?

40:01.573 --> 40:02.704
No, thanks.

40:02.748 --> 40:04.924
Oh, too bad.

40:04.967 --> 40:07.448
It's a wonderful brandy,
Mr. Hakansson.

40:08.884 --> 40:10.886
How do you know my name?

40:10.930 --> 40:15.151
Detective Laterza from downstairs
told me he'd called you.

40:16.718 --> 40:18.764
And I saw you yesterday
out on the street.

40:21.549 --> 40:23.290
I know what happened
to your family.

40:23.333 --> 40:24.333
I'm sorry.

40:25.248 --> 40:26.248
Sit down.

40:32.473 --> 40:34.214
He was a lovely chap.

40:34.257 --> 40:35.607
We became friends
over the years.

40:38.392 --> 40:41.395
He died that same night
when he called you.

40:42.788 --> 40:44.006
Suicide?

40:46.792 --> 40:47.923
Someone killed him.

40:50.665 --> 40:52.798
I'm glad you don't believe
in the official version.

40:53.799 --> 40:55.757
That makes two of us.

40:55.801 --> 40:58.543
Kind of hard to slash
your own throat.

40:58.586 --> 41:02.547
Laterza had a feeling he was
stepping into a hornet's nest.

41:02.590 --> 41:04.505
I asked him,
but he didn't want to tell me.

41:05.724 --> 41:08.204
At first,
I was a bit offended.

41:08.248 --> 41:09.488
I thought we were good friends.

41:11.120 --> 41:12.120
But now I get it.

41:13.035 --> 41:14.428
He was protecting me.

41:16.256 --> 41:17.344
From whom?

41:18.519 --> 41:19.738
The people who killed him.

41:21.566 --> 41:22.741
You need to be careful.

41:24.569 --> 41:25.918
It's kinda hard to live
your life

41:25.961 --> 41:27.702
without knowing
who killed your loved ones.

41:29.443 --> 41:30.531
Revenge?

41:35.231 --> 41:36.232
I don't know.

41:38.104 --> 41:39.104
Justice, maybe.

41:46.939 --> 41:47.939
Come with me.

41:55.643 --> 41:57.471
He put everything
he knew up here.

42:00.648 --> 42:02.288
FATAL ACCIDENT,
CAR SKIDS AND CATCHES FIRE

42:07.046 --> 42:08.395
[clears throat]
Who's this guy?

42:09.570 --> 42:10.570
I don't know.

42:12.225 --> 42:16.925
Laterza always said no one could
be trusted in this village,

42:16.969 --> 42:19.406
not the local politicians,
not the police.

42:20.842 --> 42:22.148
Corruption is everywhere.

42:25.325 --> 42:27.196
I'll be in my apartment
if you need me.

42:27.240 --> 42:28.415
Thanks.

43:45.318 --> 43:46.798
[in Italian] Damn it.

45:13.319 --> 45:15.843
[in English] Get out of the car.
Get out. Get your hands up.

45:18.150 --> 45:19.238
Get out, slowly.

45:22.981 --> 45:24.634
Come forward. Forward.

45:26.506 --> 45:28.943
Two fingers, get your weapon out,
put it down.

45:28.987 --> 45:30.075
Slowly.

45:32.294 --> 45:33.774
I can tell you got it all wrong.

45:36.777 --> 45:38.431
I'm really sorry
for your family.

45:38.474 --> 45:40.389
Cell phone, take it out.

45:40.433 --> 45:42.696
Throw it down here. Quickly.

45:51.400 --> 45:52.488
Take your handcuffs out.

45:55.883 --> 45:57.145
Cuff yourself.

45:57.189 --> 45:58.930
You gotta be kidding. Cuff yourself.

46:00.235 --> 46:01.236
One hand.

46:10.115 --> 46:11.115
Where are we going?

46:12.639 --> 46:13.858
Where are we going?

46:13.901 --> 46:14.946
Let's go.

46:25.086 --> 46:27.741
Where are you taking me?
What do you want?

46:28.873 --> 46:30.962
Where are we going?

46:31.005 --> 46:32.746
I had nothing to do
with their kidnapping!

46:36.489 --> 46:37.489
[in Italian]
I gotta go.

46:38.317 --> 46:40.362
My wife needs something.

46:40.406 --> 46:42.234
Call me for any emergency,
okay?

46:42.277 --> 46:43.278
Thanks.

46:52.113 --> 46:53.113
[in English] What?

46:54.899 --> 46:55.987
[groans]

46:58.206 --> 46:59.206
No.

47:00.078 --> 47:02.297
[grunting]

47:07.999 --> 47:09.957
What? What do you want?

47:10.001 --> 47:12.003
I ask questions, you answer.

47:12.046 --> 47:13.091
What?

47:14.919 --> 47:16.485
Laterza.

47:16.529 --> 47:17.660
He knew too much,
right?

47:18.705 --> 47:20.315
That's why someone killed him.

47:20.359 --> 47:22.163
- I don't know what you're talking...
- Who killed him?

47:22.187 --> 47:23.707
I don't know
what you're talking about.

47:24.624 --> 47:26.626
I saw a picture of you and Lupo.

47:26.669 --> 47:28.019
Who is he?

47:28.062 --> 47:29.672
What's your connection to him?

47:29.716 --> 47:32.937
No Lupo's name came up
during the investigation, none!

47:32.980 --> 47:34.068
- [gunshot]
- No.

47:36.984 --> 47:38.029
Last warning.

47:39.465 --> 47:40.466
Who is he?

47:44.687 --> 47:45.950
I don't...

47:45.993 --> 47:48.387
[groaning, screaming]

47:57.918 --> 48:01.748
Fuck. Oh, fuck.

48:01.791 --> 48:03.097
What about the kidnappings?

48:04.664 --> 48:08.059
It's to finance his operation.
Drug smuggling.

48:09.843 --> 48:11.453
He alone
covers half of Italy.

48:11.497 --> 48:12.628
That's all.

48:13.238 --> 48:15.370
[groans]

48:15.414 --> 48:17.494
What about those men
who tried to kill me last night?

48:20.854 --> 48:22.574
[Giordano] You got here
in the wrong moment.

48:23.335 --> 48:25.554
Lupo is going to retire.

48:25.598 --> 48:28.818
He has this one
last operation.

48:32.257 --> 48:34.824
Enough to let this girl
disappear from San Gallo.

48:34.868 --> 48:35.869
San Gallo?

48:38.089 --> 48:39.481
San Gallo. Where is San Gallo?

Where is San Gallo?

48:55.193 --> 48:56.542
I told you
everything I know.

48:58.587 --> 48:59.849
You let me go now.

You let me go now!

No, don't ask me.

51:52.326 --> 51:53.326
Come.

51:54.415 --> 51:56.722
Come here, 26th Street.

52:17.351 --> 52:18.671
[in English]
Do you know this man?

52:19.397 --> 52:20.702
Hey.

52:20.746 --> 52:22.400
Do you know this man?
It's important.

52:22.443 --> 52:24.010
Important to who?

52:26.708 --> 52:27.970
Let me ask you a question.

52:29.189 --> 52:30.886
Your neighbor,
Laterza.

52:32.323 --> 52:33.846
Did he commit suicide or not?

52:35.674 --> 52:36.892
Are you new here?

52:39.417 --> 52:41.027
I'm from Torino.

52:41.070 --> 52:43.769
And I think I should be the one
asking questions here.

52:44.987 --> 52:46.728
Not until
I know I can trust you.

52:49.166 --> 52:51.046
So you're telling me
you don't trust the police?

52:55.955 --> 52:58.436
It looks like we both walked
into a hornet's nest.

53:00.873 --> 53:02.918
Yeah.

53:02.962 --> 53:06.226
Listen, I've been doing
some research on my own and...

53:08.576 --> 53:09.577

53:10.883 --> 53:12.003
Do you know what that means?

53:13.364 --> 53:15.540
[exhales]
It's a warning.

53:19.326 --> 53:20.458
A warning.

53:22.808 --> 53:23.896
I have a wife.

53:25.680 --> 53:28.422
And I'm about to become
a father. Twins.

53:31.512 --> 53:33.558
And I don't know what to do.

53:36.256 --> 53:37.779
Well, then you better
find Hakansson.

[in English]
I can't believe this.

54:13.989 --> 54:15.643
I'm wondering
how he lived so long.

54:19.604 --> 54:20.648
He knew everything.

54:22.084 --> 54:23.477
He's headed here.

Drop the rifle, slowly.

55:36.985 --> 55:37.985
Drop the rifle.

55:40.815 --> 55:41.815

A bad wound.

56:25.382 --> 56:26.731
He should go
to the hospital.

I need to ask you a favor.

56:37.132 --> 56:38.438
Sure.

56:38.482 --> 56:41.006
Just do what
I'm about to tell you.

56:41.049 --> 56:42.964
I don't know if I can do that.

56:43.008 --> 56:45.140
Listen. Grab whatever
you need for the night

56:45.184 --> 56:47.447
and go to the address
I'm about to send you.

56:47.491 --> 56:49.851
I'll try to be there as quick as I can,
maybe in the morning.

56:50.189 --> 56:51.233
I...

56:53.410 --> 56:54.672

56:54.715 --> 56:56.500

Number one is not answering.

57:29.533 --> 57:30.925
The Albanians are here.

Some tea? Yeah.

01:01:16.063 --> 01:01:17.369
I hate it when he does this.

01:01:18.152 --> 01:01:19.197
He keeps secrets.

01:01:20.459 --> 01:01:21.547
I'm his wife.

01:01:23.114 --> 01:01:25.812
- How am I supposed to trust him?
- He does it out of love.

01:17:09.625 --> 01:17:11.975
I-I didn't want...

01:17:12.018 --> 01:17:13.846
I didn't want...
It's not my fault.

01:17:13.890 --> 01:17:15.631
It's not my fault.

01:17:15.674 --> 01:17:17.284
I-I didn't want.

01:17:17.328 --> 01:17:19.199
[stammering]

01:17:19.243 --> 01:17:21.245
This is not my fault,
believe me.

01:17:21.288 --> 01:17:22.288
[shouts]

01:17:48.359 --> 01:17:51.362
[grunting, straining]

01:18:03.374 --> 01:18:04.897
[panting]

01:18:10.337 --> 01:18:11.337
You lose.

01:18:11.861 --> 01:18:12.949
[gunshot]

01:18:31.837 --> 01:18:33.796
What's her name? Maria.

01:18:33.839 --> 01:18:36.581
Maria. It's okay, come on.

01:18:36.624 --> 01:18:39.540
[Graziani, in Italian] Maria.
Come, I'm a police officer. Don't worry.

01:18:39.584 --> 01:18:41.264
[Hakansson, in English]
Come on. It's okay.

01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:46.765
All right, come on. Don't worry.
Don't worry. It's okay.

01:18:46.809 --> 01:18:47.897
It's okay, it's okay.

01:19:02.694 --> 01:19:04.150
[Maria, in Italian]
Where's my father?

01:19:04.174 --> 01:19:05.784
This way. Come with us.

01:19:05.828 --> 01:19:07.028
[in English]
Come on. Let's go.

01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:14.271
I'll take these.

01:19:15.794 --> 01:19:16.882
There's your dad.

01:19:19.102 --> 01:19:20.364
[in Italian] Dad?

01:19:20.407 --> 01:19:22.148
Dad.Maria.

01:19:22.192 --> 01:19:24.324
[both crying]

01:19:30.156 --> 01:19:32.680
I made a mistake.

01:19:32.724 --> 01:19:35.379
Dad... I made a mistake, honey.

01:19:35.422 --> 01:19:36.422
[sobs]

01:19:47.347 --> 01:19:48.653
[phone buzzes]

01:19:53.005 --> 01:19:55.703
[guitar instrumental playing]

01:20:21.164 --> 01:20:22.165
[Graziani] Hey.

01:20:23.601 --> 01:20:25.951
All cleaned up, all set.

01:20:25.995 --> 01:20:28.301
You're free to go.Thanks.

01:20:28.345 --> 01:20:30.216
Oh, by the way,
Giordano...

01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:33.654
He recovered enough
to end up in front of a court

01:20:33.698 --> 01:20:36.098
and probably the judge is gonna
take care of everything, so...

01:20:38.050 --> 01:20:40.748
Well, it was good work,
Detective.

01:20:40.792 --> 01:20:41.792
Thank you.

01:20:43.142 --> 01:20:45.884
Oh, yeah.
Uh, your newborns.

01:20:45.928 --> 01:20:49.105
My kids. Wait,
I gotta show you a picture.

01:20:49.148 --> 01:20:50.846
Mmm. They're growing fast.

01:20:51.716 --> 01:20:53.544
[Hakansson chuckles]

01:20:53.587 --> 01:20:55.870
And I guess we can say they're
gonna grow up in a better world.

01:20:55.894 --> 01:20:57.374
Thanks to us.

01:20:57.417 --> 01:20:59.028
Yeah, let's hope so.Yeah.

01:21:01.334 --> 01:21:02.553
All right, well...

01:21:05.556 --> 01:21:06.731
Thanks for everything.

01:21:08.167 --> 01:21:09.560
You have my number.

01:21:09.603 --> 01:21:11.301
Anything you need,
just give me a call.

01:21:11.344 --> 01:21:12.344
Will do.

01:21:17.655 --> 01:21:18.743
Hakansson.

01:21:23.966 --> 01:21:25.206
Come and visit once in a while.

01:21:26.055 --> 01:21:27.056
We're gonna miss you.

01:21:28.971 --> 01:21:30.015
Yeah.

01:21:48.512 --> 01:21:50.427
[birds chirping]

01:21:54.605 --> 01:21:56.845
[Hakansson] There's no joy or
sorrow for what we just did.

01:22:00.437 --> 01:22:03.788
All I remember is a boy walking
in his father's footsteps.

01:22:09.141 --> 01:22:10.142
I stopped.

01:22:11.448 --> 01:22:13.885
I looked up at the sky.

01:22:13.929 --> 01:22:18.498
And I knew the tracker,
the hunter and its prey...

01:22:19.543 --> 01:22:20.892
all live inside me.

01:22:39.345 --> 01:22:41.173
[upbeat music playing]
