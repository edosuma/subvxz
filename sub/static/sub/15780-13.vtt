WEBVTT

00:02.549 --> 00:04.141
- 911?
- Please, Rocky is killing people!

00:04.184 --> 00:05.708
- It's Rocky!
- Sir, calm down.

00:05.752 --> 00:06.844
Now, where are you?

00:06.887 --> 00:07.911
It's a big movie theater on Main.

00:07.954 --> 00:09.421
Oh, my God, Rocky has a knife!

00:09.456 --> 00:10.445
You're watching "Rocky"?

00:10.490 --> 00:13.084
- Rocky what? "Rocky 4" with lvan Drago?
- Horror!

00:13.126 --> 00:17.460
Another baffling mystery successfully
solved by the best family in the universe.

00:17.497 --> 00:18.794
Whatever, keep it moving.

00:18.832 --> 00:21.027
These shoes are wreaking havoc
on my heel spurs.

00:21.068 --> 00:22.968
I just can't believe
the Phantom of the Cineplex...

00:23.003 --> 00:25.233
was Old Man Johnson all along.

00:25.272 --> 00:27.740
What I can't figure out is why he did it.

00:27.774 --> 00:30.504
Apparently to screw your father out of
yet another commission...

00:30.544 --> 00:34.503
because you don't need a $100,000
spectral analytical ectoplasmic locator...

00:34.548 --> 00:36.607
to catch a jackass in a rubber mask!

00:38.118 --> 00:40.109
Doc, you OK?
What the hell is that?

00:40.153 --> 00:41.450
It's nothing, Brock.

00:41.488 --> 00:42.921
Probably a hernia... I've had it forever.

00:42.956 --> 00:45.686
It'll pop back in in a few hours,
always does.

00:45.726 --> 00:47.956
Oh, Doc, what the f...

00:47.994 --> 00:49.484
Get back on the X-1.

00:49.529 --> 00:51.360
We're taking you to a hospital, stat!

00:51.398 --> 00:53.389
Brock, will you stop worrying
for once and...

00:58.572 --> 00:59.732
This is serious.

00:59.773 --> 01:00.967
You can say that again.

01:01.007 --> 01:02.634
Dad's becoming a real fatty.

01:02.676 --> 01:06.237
No, Hank!
I think Pop is... pregnant!

01:13.453 --> 01:15.512
Medic!

01:15.555 --> 01:17.887
What's this?
Another one?

01:17.924 --> 01:19.687
Were you guys at
"The Rocky Horror Show"?

01:21.294 --> 01:23.421
Yeah. Could you please help him?

01:23.463 --> 01:25.090
Orderly.

01:25.132 --> 01:26.258
Put him in O.R. Three.

01:26.299 --> 01:29.462
The O.R. Is all full, Doctor,
and they just keep coming!

01:29.503 --> 01:30.765
The Cineplex just called.

01:30.804 --> 01:33.102
They found a few more
in the projection booth!

01:33.140 --> 01:34.300
OK.

01:34.341 --> 01:36.536
You'll have to put him in Maternity.

01:36.576 --> 01:38.203
Maternity?

01:38.245 --> 01:40.270
You weren't kidding, Deano.

01:40.313 --> 01:42.440
Pop really is having a baby.

01:43.650 --> 01:45.379
I think I need a cigarette.

01:49.523 --> 01:52.287
I'm sorry, sir, medical personnel only
beyond this point.

01:52.325 --> 01:53.451
I'm staying with him.

01:53.493 --> 01:54.653
I go where he goes.

01:56.229 --> 01:58.789
You must be his partner then.

01:58.832 --> 02:00.299
Not really, it's more like I work for him.

02:00.333 --> 02:01.925
Wait a minute! No!

02:01.968 --> 02:04.436
Look, you two, I'm dying in here.

02:04.471 --> 02:06.439
Have you heard anything
from Dr. Girlfriend?

02:06.473 --> 02:09.738
We've been calling her every hour,
and we keep getting her machine.

02:09.776 --> 02:11.073
Did you try the cellular phone?

02:11.111 --> 02:12.874
Yeah, we followed your
instructions to the letter.

02:12.913 --> 02:14.039
It's just that...

02:14.080 --> 02:15.843
Have you destroyed
the giant cocoon headquarters?

02:15.882 --> 02:17.008
Not yet.

02:17.050 --> 02:18.415
Have you sent the charred remains
of Wonderboy...

02:18.452 --> 02:20.010
to his beloved Captain Sunshine?

02:20.053 --> 02:21.247
- Yes.
- Rewound and returned...

02:21.288 --> 02:22.915
the director's cut of "Working Girl"?

02:22.956 --> 02:24.253
We tried, but...

02:24.291 --> 02:27.692
Unleashed the herpes-smeared sexbots
upon the traitorous members of the Guild?

02:27.727 --> 02:29.524
- Yep.
- Filled Phantom Limb's garage...

02:29.563 --> 02:32.191
with clingy, static-charged
Styrofoam packing peanuts?

02:32.232 --> 02:33.221
No.

02:33.266 --> 02:35.860
Sent apology letters to each
of my sponsored Ugandan foster children?

02:35.902 --> 02:38.097
- Check!
- Have you...

02:38.138 --> 02:40.402
killed the Venture brothers?

02:42.175 --> 02:43.335
I don't know.

02:43.376 --> 02:45.537
It might be nice to have
a little brother or sister.

02:45.579 --> 02:47.103
How are we supposed
to go on adventures...

02:47.147 --> 02:49.206
With some little crumb-snatcher
tagging along?

02:49.249 --> 02:50.944
And how's Brock gonna look all cool...

02:50.984 --> 02:53.452
if he has to wear one of those harnesses
on his chest?

02:54.588 --> 02:56.021
Oh, God, it's Rocky!

02:56.056 --> 02:57.921
- No! Not again!
- Well...

02:57.958 --> 02:58.982
Has Pop...

02:59.025 --> 03:01.118
- had it yet?
- Not yet, Dean.

03:01.161 --> 03:02.890
Don't you worry, though.

03:02.929 --> 03:05.056
Your dad's a...

03:05.098 --> 03:07.066
tough little dude.

03:07.100 --> 03:08.692
He's gonna pull through.

03:08.735 --> 03:10.794
Listen, there's no use in you two
hanging around.

03:10.837 --> 03:12.805
I want you to take a taxi
back to the compound.

03:12.839 --> 03:16.172
I called Dr. Orpheus.
He's gonna look after you.

03:16.209 --> 03:19.303
Who wants pizza rolls?

03:19.346 --> 03:20.870
Thanks, Dr. O.

03:20.914 --> 03:22.677
Hey, what's the green stuff?

03:22.716 --> 03:25.048
That's chai tea, Hank.

03:25.085 --> 03:28.077
I've been receiving a steady shipment of it
ever since I saved the emperor...

03:28.121 --> 03:30.351
from an army of clay samurai warriors.

03:30.390 --> 03:31.448
Oh. It's good!

03:31.491 --> 03:35.484
I think it tastes a bit like Play-doh,
but Pumpkin adores it.

03:35.529 --> 03:38.089
Is, uh... she coming home tonight?

03:38.131 --> 03:39.428
Wouldn't you like to know.

03:39.466 --> 03:42.435
She's attending
an electronic music recital.

03:42.469 --> 03:44.767
She will be arriving home near midnight...

03:44.804 --> 03:48.262
I suspect smelling mysteriously of cloves.

03:48.308 --> 03:50.037
Do you know when we can go back home?

03:50.076 --> 03:53.944
Mr. Samson seemed vague about that,
but it could be quite awhile.

03:53.980 --> 03:55.641
So, I suggest that you get comfy.

03:55.682 --> 03:58.583
There is a television
behind the El Greco.

03:58.618 --> 04:01.553
Sadly, the remote has vanished
from the material sphere...

04:01.588 --> 04:03.681
so it's stuck on Animal Planet.

04:03.723 --> 04:04.951
Thanks, Dr. O.

04:04.991 --> 04:06.219
I'm sure we'll be fine.

04:06.259 --> 04:12.926
Good night, you princes of Venture,
you kings of sleepovers.

04:15.802 --> 04:17.394
Well, I have good news.

04:17.437 --> 04:20.065
- Oh, thank...
- And bad news.

04:20.106 --> 04:21.903
You son of a bitch!

04:21.942 --> 04:23.170
OK, fine.

04:23.209 --> 04:25.006
Hit me with it.
Don't soft soap me.

04:25.045 --> 04:26.376
Give it to me straight.
I can take it.

04:26.413 --> 04:28.973
The good news is
the operation was a success.

04:29.015 --> 04:31.108
We were able to remove
the entire tumor...

04:31.151 --> 04:32.140
from your midsection.

04:32.185 --> 04:33.777
See, you big worrywart.

04:33.820 --> 04:35.481
What's the bad news?

04:35.522 --> 04:36.750
I...

04:36.790 --> 04:37.916
Oh, jeez...

04:37.958 --> 04:39.357
This is really hard.

04:39.392 --> 04:40.416
Oh, God.

04:40.460 --> 04:42.587
It's the big "C," isn't it?
You did this to me!

04:42.629 --> 04:44.096
All that secondhand smoke!

04:44.130 --> 04:45.893
You should be the one in this bed, mister!

04:45.932 --> 04:47.194
No, no, no, Dr. Venture.

04:47.233 --> 04:48.723
The tumor was benign.

04:48.768 --> 04:50.292
It's just that...

04:50.337 --> 04:53.272
Well, uh, we cannot find it.

04:53.306 --> 04:55.900
What do you mean you can't find it?

04:55.942 --> 04:58.638
Well, we took it out, and I don't know.

04:58.678 --> 05:02.774
When I finished sewing you up,
I turned around, and it was just gone.

05:02.816 --> 05:04.044
Gone.

05:04.084 --> 05:05.176
Well...

05:05.218 --> 05:06.549
I want a second opinion.

05:06.586 --> 05:08.679
Oh, wait... I'm a doctor!

05:08.722 --> 05:10.212
I can give myself one!

05:10.256 --> 05:12.884
You suck, and I'm leaving.

05:12.926 --> 05:15.019
This is how it's always gonna be.

05:15.061 --> 05:16.085
What do you mean?

05:16.129 --> 05:19.565
Now that Dad has a brand-new baby,
he's not gonna want us hanging around.

05:19.599 --> 05:21.089
I'll bet he just leaves us here.

05:21.134 --> 05:23.364
You're crazy.
Dad would never do that.

05:23.403 --> 05:26.099
Well, I, for one,
ain't gonna stick around to find out.

05:26.139 --> 05:27.231
I'm out of here.

05:27.273 --> 05:31.209
I'm not gonna play second banana fiddle
to some stupid ol' baby!

05:31.244 --> 05:32.472
Well, not me.

05:32.512 --> 05:33.911
I'm staying right here.

05:33.947 --> 05:36.313
I'll be sleeping in a room
right next to Triana.

05:36.349 --> 05:38.840
And then she'll hear, like,
thunder or something...

05:38.885 --> 05:41.513
and she'll run into my room
all scared and stuff.

05:41.554 --> 05:46.753
And I'll be, like, "Hush, my darling.
It's just ionized air molecules expanding."

05:46.793 --> 05:48.761
And she'll be, like, "Oh, hold me."

05:48.795 --> 05:49.921
And then I'll, like...

05:49.963 --> 05:53.592
Dude, if we stay here,
that means that we'll be Dr. Orpheus' kids.

05:53.633 --> 05:55.464
And that means Triana will be your sister.

05:55.502 --> 05:58.027
And that means you two will have
extra-retard babies.

05:59.339 --> 06:01.068
I never thought of that.

06:01.107 --> 06:03.337
All right, I'm with you.

06:03.376 --> 06:06.368
The medical board
will be getting one stern little letter...

06:06.413 --> 06:08.779
from Dr. Thaddeus S. Venture,
I can assure you.

06:08.815 --> 06:10.874
I can have quite the poison pen when l...

06:10.917 --> 06:12.851
- What?
- What?

06:12.886 --> 06:15.719
Hey, buddy,
you didn't happen to see a, uh...

06:15.755 --> 06:18.349
experimental supersonic aircraft, did you?

06:18.391 --> 06:20.256
Oh, you're kidding me!

06:20.293 --> 06:21.555
Silver...

06:21.594 --> 06:22.959
about 100 feet long.

06:22.996 --> 06:24.623
No?

06:24.664 --> 06:26.564
Nuclear engines...

06:26.599 --> 06:27.861
No?

06:28.935 --> 06:30.232
Pumpkin, you're up early...

06:30.270 --> 06:33.398
And you've changed
out of your jam-jams into...

06:33.440 --> 06:36.739
the clothes you wore last night.

06:36.776 --> 06:38.971
How frugal of you.
Did you just get home?

06:39.012 --> 06:42.243
Kim was totally plastered,
and then we were like...

06:42.282 --> 06:43.909
Sweetie, let me love you.

06:43.950 --> 06:45.577
Don't make this hard for us.

06:45.618 --> 06:47.745
Now we have the Venture twins
staying with us...

06:47.787 --> 06:50.551
and they're not in the den.

06:50.590 --> 06:52.751
I sense something is amiss.

06:52.792 --> 06:56.922
Is there something else
you forgot to tell Daddy?

06:56.963 --> 06:58.521
They ran away.

06:58.565 --> 07:03.195
They said they were going to the city
to become famous lion-tamers.

07:03.236 --> 07:05.363
Mr. Venture trusted me
with his offspring.

07:05.405 --> 07:06.702
I have failed him!

07:06.740 --> 07:09.072
For, even now, they could be in peril!

07:09.109 --> 07:10.508
Remember when I ran away?

07:10.543 --> 07:12.340
I just went to Rachel's house.

07:12.378 --> 07:15.370
So try not to embarrass them... for me.

07:15.415 --> 07:18.873
Don't worry, Pumpkin,
it is not my intention to shame them.

07:18.918 --> 07:20.783
I just have to keep them safe.

07:20.820 --> 07:23.050
I will be their shadow...

07:23.089 --> 07:26.581
Nay, their unseen guardian angel!

07:26.626 --> 07:30.221
Pumpkin, get me my cloak.

07:30.263 --> 07:31.560
Why don't you wear the...

07:31.598 --> 07:33.225
All right, fine.

07:33.266 --> 07:36.929
Get me my blue windbreaker!

07:38.000 --> 07:44.074

07:49.783 --> 07:51.375
Dude, look on that mountain!

07:51.417 --> 07:53.146
A haunted mansion.

07:53.186 --> 07:54.483
So what?

07:54.521 --> 07:56.045
A haunted mansion!

07:56.089 --> 07:58.250
Ghosts and evil scientists and stuff.

07:58.291 --> 07:59.724
What? Am I hearing things?

07:59.759 --> 08:01.522
Am I all alone out here?

08:01.561 --> 08:04.553
Didn't you just feel the wind of freedom
ripping through your sweater vest?

08:04.597 --> 08:07.657
Can't you hear the wind calling,
little miss, little miss can't-be-wrong?

08:07.700 --> 08:08.724
We're free.

08:08.768 --> 08:10.030
We are the future.

08:10.069 --> 08:11.627
You're still thinking like the old Dean.

08:11.671 --> 08:12.695
You're right.

08:12.739 --> 08:14.536
Screw that junky old mansion!

08:14.574 --> 08:16.974
Boy, the world better watch out for us...

08:17.010 --> 08:19.843
because we're on the fast road
to now-town!

08:19.879 --> 08:21.938
Haunted castles!
Who needs 'em?

08:21.981 --> 08:23.107
Not me!

08:23.149 --> 08:24.275
Not me!

08:24.317 --> 08:27.047
Go Team...

08:27.086 --> 08:28.348
- Guys?
- Brothers?

08:29.622 --> 08:30.987
I'll tell you what the problem is...

08:31.024 --> 08:33.390
they just give Ph.D.s out in India.

08:33.426 --> 08:35.519
The medical schools
over there are like Apex Tech...

08:35.562 --> 08:36.586
with bigger bugs.

08:36.629 --> 08:38.494
You should have stayed
at the hospital, Doc.

08:38.530 --> 08:39.998
Just put me on the bed.

08:40.033 --> 08:41.659
And bring up the big TV.

08:41.701 --> 08:43.566
Oh, and can you fluff up the husband?

08:43.602 --> 08:44.934
There you go.

08:44.971 --> 08:46.632
Here's the clicker,
here's H.E.L.P.eR.'s remote.

08:46.673 --> 08:48.573
I'm gonna go downstairs,
make you some soup.

08:48.608 --> 08:50.576
What would I do without you, Brock?

08:50.610 --> 08:51.736
You would have died.

08:51.778 --> 08:55.475
Oh, Brock, don't forget the big TV
when you come back up.

08:55.515 --> 08:57.915
And maybe a couple
of my special aspirins...

08:57.951 --> 09:02.081
and some applesauce,
ginger ale, a couple more blankets...

09:02.121 --> 09:07.354
the "New York Times,"
Britney records...

09:07.393 --> 09:08.417
What the?

09:09.696 --> 09:10.993
Doc, we've got a problem.

09:11.030 --> 09:12.088
I want you to stay put.

09:12.131 --> 09:13.325
There's someone in the compound.

09:14.367 --> 09:16.835
Yeah, what about the big TV?

09:25.745 --> 09:27.212
What'll it be, sugar?

09:27.247 --> 09:31.479
The flask of sugar seems to be filled,
but your concern has been noted.

09:31.517 --> 09:33.178
Now, please stand to the side.

09:33.219 --> 09:35.210
You gonna order anything or not?

09:35.255 --> 09:38.554
I made the purchase of
this Homeboy figurine...

09:38.591 --> 09:41.617
from the vending machines
in your sitting room.

09:41.661 --> 09:43.060
I've had a long day.

09:43.096 --> 09:44.791
You can either order some food or leave.

09:44.831 --> 09:46.355
Fine.

09:46.399 --> 09:48.560
Now, let me see.

09:51.971 --> 09:53.404
No, no.

09:53.439 --> 09:55.134
I will have a tonic.

09:55.174 --> 09:56.300
What kind of tonic?

09:56.342 --> 09:58.071
Moxie.

09:58.111 --> 09:59.408
We don't have that.

09:59.445 --> 10:01.003
Birch beer.

10:01.047 --> 10:02.412
Nope.

10:02.448 --> 10:03.710
The pancakes, please.

10:03.750 --> 10:05.581
And, yes, I know what time it is.

10:05.618 --> 10:07.586
I'll be having them for lunch.

10:07.620 --> 10:08.678
Pretty cool, right?

10:08.721 --> 10:10.154
And you?

10:10.189 --> 10:12.316
And the gentleman will be having
the lamb dinner...

10:12.358 --> 10:14.292
and a side of whatever disco fries are.

10:14.327 --> 10:16.056
Mr. Pibb?

10:16.095 --> 10:17.824
Tell me you have Mr. Pibb.

10:19.232 --> 10:21.063
Grape, orange, or cola?

10:22.635 --> 10:23.932
Grape.

10:23.970 --> 10:25.597
That waitress was totally into me.

10:26.739 --> 10:28.400
She knows a good deal when she sees it.

10:28.441 --> 10:32.002
I might let her kick the tires
of the old Hank machine.

10:32.045 --> 10:33.342
Me, ah!

10:33.379 --> 10:35.040
I got a girl back home.

10:35.081 --> 10:36.548
So you can have her.

10:36.582 --> 10:39.745
Hey. Check that yokel with long hair.

10:39.786 --> 10:42.118
Oh, I think she's cute.

10:48.661 --> 10:49.753
Hello, Rusty.

10:49.796 --> 10:51.127
Daddy?

10:51.164 --> 10:52.654
What are you doing in Mommy's womb?

10:52.699 --> 10:58.331
I came to tell you, son,
there is another Venture.

10:58.371 --> 10:59.929
Why are you talking like Yoda?

10:59.973 --> 11:03.340
This is your dream, Rusty,
you tell me.

11:11.250 --> 11:12.478
Hello, Rusty.

11:12.518 --> 11:13.610
Who the hell are you?

11:13.653 --> 11:16.383
Don't you recognize me, Rusty?

11:16.422 --> 11:17.753
It's been a while, I know.

11:17.790 --> 11:19.951
I get it, you're supposed
to be my father, right?

11:19.993 --> 11:22.154
- I'm still dreaming.
- This is no dream.

11:22.195 --> 11:23.856
Fine... hallucination... whatever.

11:23.896 --> 11:25.727
I must be still woozy from
the painkillers, though.

11:25.765 --> 11:26.789
I got your head all wrong.

11:26.833 --> 11:29.097
Forty-three years ago...

11:29.135 --> 11:30.625
you tried to kill me.

11:30.670 --> 11:32.297
Forty-three years ago I wasn't even...

11:32.338 --> 11:33.930
I'll give you a hint.

11:33.973 --> 11:36.908
We used to share a rather cramped
little one-bedroom...

11:36.943 --> 11:38.535
down on Mommy Street.

11:38.578 --> 11:40.136
Is that my oven?

11:40.179 --> 11:41.441
And that bit there...

11:41.481 --> 11:43.415
That's the capacitator from my robot!

11:43.449 --> 11:45.508
Just what is going on here, mister?

11:45.551 --> 11:47.815
Consider these bits of crap I've stolen...

11:47.854 --> 11:50.152
the first small installments
of what you owe me, Rusty.

11:52.759 --> 11:54.522
That's OK, Rusty,

11:54.560 --> 11:56.960
I've waited this long.

11:56.996 --> 11:59.794
I can wait a few minutes more.

12:01.467 --> 12:02.661
Hey, boy.

12:02.702 --> 12:05.432
Why don't you get a haircut?

12:05.471 --> 12:06.733
You hear me, boy?

12:06.773 --> 12:09.901
Are you deaf,
or are you just a faggot?

12:09.942 --> 12:13.571
May I suggest that you two gentlemen
take your local color elsewhere?

12:13.613 --> 12:15.877
You're drawing undesirable attention
to my presence.

12:15.915 --> 12:18.247
What are you gonna do about it?

12:18.284 --> 12:20.013
You're wearing pantyhose.

12:20.053 --> 12:21.884
- What?
- He is...

12:21.921 --> 12:23.855
'cause he's a gay-boy.

12:23.890 --> 12:26.222
Consider this your final warning.

12:26.259 --> 12:29.422
You do not know the risk you are taking.

12:29.462 --> 12:32.920
For a whisper from my lips
could open your mind...

12:32.965 --> 12:37.425
to a world of arcane tortures.

12:37.470 --> 12:38.960
Faggot.

12:40.773 --> 12:41.831
Check, please.

12:44.277 --> 12:46.336
Brock, come in, Brock.

12:46.379 --> 12:48.847
Your beloved Brock
won't be saving you this time.

12:48.881 --> 12:50.075
I've already seen to that.

12:50.116 --> 12:53.882
Go ahead, try and hurt me, mister,
because you're not getting in here.

12:53.920 --> 12:56.787
Those walls are solid ste...

12:58.491 --> 13:00.686
Oh, you just don't get it,
do you, Rusty?

13:00.726 --> 13:02.250
You can't escape me.

13:02.295 --> 13:04.195
I know all your tricks.

13:20.480 --> 13:24.007
Do you know that you were doing fifteen
on a sixty-five-mile-per-hour highway?

13:24.050 --> 13:25.415
We did not, officer.

13:25.451 --> 13:27.817
But if you call our father,
he should be able to clear all this up.

13:27.854 --> 13:29.014
Dean!

13:29.055 --> 13:30.545
We don't have a father anymore.

13:30.590 --> 13:32.319
All right, what's going on here?

13:32.358 --> 13:33.825
And what are those?

13:33.860 --> 13:35.452
Hover-bikes.

13:35.495 --> 13:39.022
Where do kids like you get hover-bikes,
selling weed to classmates, huh?

13:39.065 --> 13:40.362
Get 'em hooked early, right?

13:40.399 --> 13:41.957
Nothing like a steady customer.

13:42.001 --> 13:45.835
Which reminds me,
shouldn't you boys be in school right now?

13:45.872 --> 13:47.203
We don't go to school.

13:47.240 --> 13:48.707
We have a bed that
teaches us everything.

13:48.741 --> 13:50.902
Oh, I get it now...

13:50.943 --> 13:52.137
dust head.

13:52.178 --> 13:53.907
Let's get off the floating chopper.

13:53.946 --> 13:55.607
He's not a dusty head.

13:55.648 --> 13:58.481
We really do have beds equipped
with audio-suggestive learning aids.

13:58.518 --> 14:00.418
Dabbling in super-science, eh?

14:00.453 --> 14:05.413
All right, you two,
I know just the place for boys like you.

14:09.462 --> 14:10.554
Oh, dear.

14:10.596 --> 14:11.654
Help us!

14:19.805 --> 14:21.102
Who the hell are you?

14:21.140 --> 14:22.164
Who else?

14:22.208 --> 14:23.732
I'm your brother, Rusty.

14:23.776 --> 14:25.607
Your twin brother.

14:25.645 --> 14:27.135
That's impossible. I don't have a...

14:27.180 --> 14:29.341
You sucker-punched me in the womb.

14:29.382 --> 14:30.849
I've been inside you all your life...

14:30.883 --> 14:34.410
watching, listening, planning, waiting.

14:34.453 --> 14:36.011
You jerry-rigged my body.

14:36.055 --> 14:37.818
That's why I have all these blackouts.

14:37.857 --> 14:39.085
I thought it was the pills.

14:39.125 --> 14:40.387
Your body's a mess.

14:40.426 --> 14:42.360
It's become absolutely uninhabitable.

14:42.395 --> 14:44.522
Yeah, well, I don't remember
asking you to live in me.

14:44.564 --> 14:45.758
Wait a minute!

14:45.798 --> 14:48.790
You're why I've been having
all these F-ed up dreams.

14:48.834 --> 14:51.496
You're probably why
I lost my hair, too, aren't you?

14:51.537 --> 14:53.300
You stole my hair!

14:54.607 --> 14:57.075
You're probably wondering
why you're here.

14:57.109 --> 15:01.102
You're here because you done
[bleep] up too many times!

15:01.147 --> 15:03.308
You think you're hot [bleep]
In a champagne glass...

15:03.349 --> 15:06.318
but you're really
cold diarrhea in a Dixie cup!

15:06.352 --> 15:08.286
And if you keep up
like you been doing...

15:08.321 --> 15:09.788
this is where you're headed.

15:10.823 --> 15:12.120
That's funny to you, right?!

15:12.158 --> 15:13.853
'Cause you're so [bleep] bad?

15:13.893 --> 15:15.087
I know your type.

15:15.127 --> 15:17.994
You think I'll just get me a costume,
rip off the neighborhood kids.

15:18.030 --> 15:21.261
Next thing you know,
you've got a jet shaped like a skull...

15:21.300 --> 15:22.494
with lasers on the front.

15:22.535 --> 15:23.729
This is totally gay.

15:23.769 --> 15:25.737
What?
Think this is gay, huh?

15:25.771 --> 15:28.399
Is that what you [bleep] said,
you scrawny piece of [bleep]?

15:28.441 --> 15:29.908
Oh, this isn't gay.

15:29.942 --> 15:31.705
But King Gorilla over there is.

15:31.744 --> 15:35.202
And I'll bet he just can't wait to snap off
a piece of your [bleep] in his [bleep].

15:35.248 --> 15:37.079
You! Get up!

15:37.116 --> 15:38.708
I said get the [bleep] up!

15:38.751 --> 15:40.150
- What's your name?
- Dean Vent...

15:40.186 --> 15:42.984
Your name is bitch!
And I own you.

15:43.022 --> 15:44.455
You're property!

15:44.490 --> 15:46.082
And when I'm tired of having sex...

15:46.125 --> 15:49.424
with every hole God drilled
in your slender frame...

15:49.462 --> 15:51.089
King Gorilla, you got a cigarette?

15:51.130 --> 15:52.722
There.

15:52.765 --> 15:54.130
I just sold you for a cigarette...

15:54.166 --> 15:56.862
And I don't smoke!

15:56.902 --> 15:58.096
Holy [bleep]!

15:58.137 --> 15:59.764
You're Dean [bleep] Venture!

15:59.805 --> 16:02.205
King, I gotta buy my bitch back.
Here's your cigarette.

16:02.241 --> 16:03.538
[Bleep] You. Give me a dollar.

16:06.145 --> 16:07.976
H.E.L.P.eR!

16:08.014 --> 16:09.379
H.E.L.P.eR., listen to me.

16:09.415 --> 16:12.782
Doc's in trouble.
I need you to drive my car.

16:14.487 --> 16:17.479
You can fly the X-1,
but you don't know how to drive stick?

16:18.691 --> 16:20.158
That's great, now punch it.

16:20.192 --> 16:21.784
I'll navigate.

16:21.827 --> 16:24.819
No, H.E.L.P.eR., it's the...
it's the right one and...

16:24.864 --> 16:26.229
it's a pedal!

16:26.265 --> 16:27.323
It's on the floor!

16:29.902 --> 16:32.496
Reverse, H.E.L.P.eR., reverse!

16:34.407 --> 16:35.704
OK, right.

16:35.741 --> 16:37.106
Right, H.E.L.P.eR.

16:37.143 --> 16:38.701
No, my right!

16:38.744 --> 16:42.339
I wish I had a program
like this when I was young...

16:42.381 --> 16:45.908
someone to tell me to knock off
all the evil science [bleep].

16:45.951 --> 16:47.919
Man, I was just like you.

16:47.953 --> 16:49.352
Then one [bleep] day...

16:49.388 --> 16:52.755
a vat of super-heated [bleep] plasma
blew up in my [bleep] face...

16:52.792 --> 16:54.692
What the [bleep] are you boys doing
in the big house?

16:54.727 --> 16:57.525
Well, our dad had a baby,
so we ran away.

16:57.563 --> 16:59.929
And then we got arrested
for not speeding enough.

16:59.965 --> 17:01.125
You shouldn't even be alive.

17:01.167 --> 17:03.965
- Huh?
- I put out a hit on you.

17:04.002 --> 17:05.300
Super-sorry.

17:05.338 --> 17:07.363
But, you know, I'm in
mother-[bleep] prison here.

17:07.406 --> 17:09.374
My life is [bleep].

17:09.407 --> 17:10.602
Dr. Girlfriend left me.

17:10.643 --> 17:11.940
Why would you want to kill us?

17:11.977 --> 17:13.808
Because she needs her space!

17:13.846 --> 17:15.279
Like I didn't give her space!

17:15.314 --> 17:17.111
She had the whole [bleep] cocoon!

17:17.148 --> 17:18.844
Now I'm gonna show you all
what it feels like...

17:18.884 --> 17:21.375
to be a victim of super-villainy.

17:21.420 --> 17:22.785
Give me your shoes.

17:22.821 --> 17:25.222
I said get those
mother-[bleep] shoes off...

17:25.257 --> 17:27.384
and throw them here!

17:27.425 --> 17:29.758
Now, give me your wallet.

17:29.795 --> 17:30.921
There!
How does that feel?

17:30.963 --> 17:32.089
How does what feel?

17:32.131 --> 17:33.393
I just took your wallet!

17:33.432 --> 17:35.229
Still want to be a super-villain?

17:35.267 --> 17:38.236
Well, I do now.
You have my wallet.

17:38.270 --> 17:41.171
Stand back, or so help me,
I'll blast you to kingdom come!

17:41.207 --> 17:42.765
Please.

17:42.808 --> 17:45.140
You couldn't blast me to
kingdom three-feet-from-here...

17:45.177 --> 17:46.405
with that thing.

17:46.445 --> 17:49.937
But this, on the other hand,
will incinerate you where you stand.

17:51.016 --> 17:53.416
Nice try, junior, but I know you're bluffing.

17:53.452 --> 17:55.079
I never got that stupid thing to work.

17:55.121 --> 17:58.921
You, no. But I did.

17:58.958 --> 18:03.486
You see, I was meant to be the son
of the late, great Jonas Venture.

18:03.529 --> 18:05.963
I'm superior to you in every way.

18:05.998 --> 18:07.795
Every way?
Check the mirror.

18:07.833 --> 18:10.597
You look like a talking fist
sticking out of an oven.

18:10.636 --> 18:12.763
You stole my life from me.

18:12.805 --> 18:14.204
Well, guess what, Rusty...

18:14.240 --> 18:16.902
I'm taking yours,
and I'm claiming my birthright.

18:16.942 --> 18:20.434
The Venture empire is mine!

18:50.743 --> 18:52.074
I'm in for murder!

18:52.111 --> 18:53.635
You boys don't want to end up in here.

18:53.679 --> 18:55.340
This place is full of [bleep] animals.

18:55.381 --> 18:57.906
I don't mean King Gorilla, Hank.

18:57.950 --> 19:00.612
I mean, this place will chew you up
and spit you out.

19:00.653 --> 19:03.019
No, I'm not talking
about Mecha Mouth, Hank.

19:03.055 --> 19:05.182
Oh, this was a big mistake.

19:05.224 --> 19:06.384
[Bleep]-A, right!

19:06.425 --> 19:07.585
This is all wrong.

19:07.626 --> 19:09.457
You boys are the [bleep]
Venture brothers!

19:09.495 --> 19:12.362
You've had your little adventure,
go the hell home.

19:12.398 --> 19:13.558
[Bleep] that [bleep]!

19:13.599 --> 19:15.590
Hank Venture, what is wrong with you?

19:15.634 --> 19:18.262
You're changing into
an extra-bad person.

19:18.304 --> 19:21.865
Do you even know how many baby angels
you just killed by saying that?

19:21.907 --> 19:23.602
Oh, my glory!

19:23.642 --> 19:24.973
You're right!

19:25.010 --> 19:26.534
What's happening to us?

19:26.579 --> 19:28.206
We searched for freedom,

19:28.247 --> 19:29.874
And it landed us in jail.

19:29.915 --> 19:31.974
I bet Dad's worried sick.

19:32.017 --> 19:34.918
And Brock... he loves you, Hank,
I just know it.

19:34.954 --> 19:36.353
Oh, this is just gay.

19:36.388 --> 19:38.822
Look, I gotta get back to yelling
at regular kids, all right?

19:52.271 --> 19:54.136
Brock! Wait!

19:54.173 --> 19:55.435
Don't!

19:55.474 --> 19:57.499
He tried to kill you, Doc.

19:57.543 --> 19:59.170
I know, but...

19:59.211 --> 20:00.940
He's my... brother.

20:00.980 --> 20:03.676
You're in shock, Doc.
Let me handle this.

20:03.716 --> 20:05.479
Brock, seriously.

20:05.518 --> 20:07.247
Samson, I'm giving you an order.

20:07.286 --> 20:08.753
You're my bodyguard, right?

20:08.787 --> 20:10.414
Well, he came out of my body.

20:10.456 --> 20:12.583
So, you'd be violating your primary...

20:12.625 --> 20:14.889
Yeah, yeah, I get it, Doc.

20:16.562 --> 20:20.498
Looks like botched attempted fratricide
runs in the family.

20:20.533 --> 20:22.433
So, does this mean we're even now?

20:22.468 --> 20:24.436
Oh, not by a long shot, Rusty.

20:24.470 --> 20:26.438
I think you owe me something

20:26.472 --> 20:28.099
for forty-three years of hell.

20:28.140 --> 20:30.836
Fine. Whatever. I'll give you the old
Venture compound on Spider-Skull Island.

20:30.876 --> 20:33.436
Just, please,
stop calling me Rusty.

20:33.479 --> 20:35.845
I haven't been called that
since I was out of college.

20:35.881 --> 20:37.178
Wait a minute.

20:37.216 --> 20:38.410
What do I call you?

20:38.450 --> 20:40.145
Jonas.

20:40.185 --> 20:42.949
Jonas Venture, Junior.

20:42.988 --> 20:44.080
Hello!

20:44.123 --> 20:46.614
My apologies, Dr. Venture.

20:46.659 --> 20:49.355
I'm loathe to intrude
while you're entertaining...

20:50.296 --> 20:51.285
guests...

20:51.330 --> 20:53.798
but there's a matter that needs
your urgent attention.

20:53.832 --> 20:54.992
What is...

20:55.034 --> 20:57.468
That's Doc's deformed twin brother
he absorbed in the womb...

20:57.503 --> 21:00.336
who's come back for revenge,
but now they've made up, so...

21:03.609 --> 21:05.600
Fine, take the busted up chifforobe.

21:05.644 --> 21:07.703
That's fair.
And you can have the X-2.

21:07.746 --> 21:10.112
The boat? What do I need the boat for?

21:10.149 --> 21:11.241
OK, take it easy.

21:11.283 --> 21:12.409
What else do you want?

21:12.451 --> 21:14.078
Do you want Dean?
You can have Dean.

21:14.119 --> 21:17.213
He can carry you on his back
like Masterblaster.

21:17.256 --> 21:18.985
What's with the low-speed chase?

21:19.024 --> 21:20.423
Come now, Mr. Venture...

21:20.459 --> 21:22.689
I think your boys have suffered
enough embarrassment...

21:22.728 --> 21:27.256
what with being bailed out of prison
by the rumble-bumble likes of us.

21:27.299 --> 21:30.564
I figure letting the boys drive ahead
might return an ounce...

21:30.603 --> 21:33.231
of their well-earned independence.

21:33.272 --> 21:35.365
For the folly of youth has...

21:35.407 --> 21:37.102
Fine!

21:37.142 --> 21:39.076
I can't believe we
have a new baby uncle!

21:39.111 --> 21:40.942
Every Christmas,
he's probably gonna give us...

21:40.980 --> 21:42.777
a Jovan Musk gift pack.

21:42.815 --> 21:44.715
And we'll have to pretend he's not
all creepy-looking.

21:44.750 --> 21:46.877
Oh, I'll bet we're gonna
have to kiss him!

21:46.919 --> 21:49.285
Right? Dude, did you shake his hand?

21:49.321 --> 21:52.290
It was like shaking hands
with a chicken dinner.

21:52.324 --> 21:55.452
That's all of them but
"kill the Venture brothers."

21:55.494 --> 21:57.962
So, if you see a place
we can get ammo for this, pull over.

21:57.997 --> 22:00.693
I think the Monarch
meant that metaphorically.

22:00.733 --> 22:02.291
What have you got here?

22:02.334 --> 22:04.234
That's a Homeboy.

22:04.269 --> 22:05.497
But be careful.

22:05.537 --> 22:10.634
That houses the souls
of two foul-mouthed rednecks!

22:10.676 --> 22:12.439
Oh, my hair's in my goggles again.

22:12.478 --> 22:13.502
I can't see squat!

22:13.545 --> 22:15.843
I'm so sick of you complaining.

22:15.881 --> 22:18.975
That's it, next salon we see,
you're getting a trim.

22:19.018 --> 22:20.280
I'm growing a ponytail.

22:20.319 --> 22:21.650
Hold on.

22:21.687 --> 22:24.178
I'm gonna ask those kids
on the mini bikes up there.

22:24.223 --> 22:26.282
Where can we get a haircut?

22:26.325 --> 22:27.952
And ammo for this?

22:27.993 --> 22:29.585
Hey, you're on the stick shift!

22:29.628 --> 22:31.596
I can't see the road!

22:44.977 --> 22:49.175
Two angels are plucked
from the heavenly sky

22:49.214 --> 22:51.341
In an instant they're gone

22:51.383 --> 22:53.408
In the blink of an eye

22:53.452 --> 22:56.285
If you listen close you'll hear

22:56.321 --> 22:58.721
Cherubs cry

22:58.757 --> 23:01.885
Oh

23:01.927 --> 23:03.189
Look away...

23:03.228 --> 23:04.559
No!

23:09.268 --> 23:11.429
All right, get their clothes.
