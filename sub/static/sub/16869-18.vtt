I understand the real reason
that you invited me on this team.

You just want
your own meta-human specialist

00:48.680 --> 00:49.727

I wish I could believe that.

- BARRY: Mmm-hmm.
-Yeah, he did.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.921
Okay, so break it down. How did it happen?

02:25.480 --> 02:26.481
Um...

02:26.840 --> 02:31.607
We were at the apartment,
and Barry sang to me,

02:32.160 --> 02:34.367
and then he proposed.

02:34.680 --> 02:37.524
My God, that's so romantic! You sing?

02:37.680 --> 02:38.806

So that card trick he played on Barry,
the water tank at Stagg,

07:56.640 --> 07:59.291

that he's masking as magic?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.128
To do the same thing? Why?

08:37.559 --> 08:39.642
He must have needed
our Earth's tech for something.

08:39.880 --> 08:42.121
Well, whatever it is,
we can definitely help you figure it out

08:42.280 --> 08:45.045
'cause I don't know about you guys,
but ever since last time you were here,

08:45.200 --> 08:49.000

- That's way too much.
-Embarrassing.

08:51.680 --> 08:52.841
Yeah, I just wanna catch him,

08:53.000 --> 08:55.606
so I can bring his ass back to Earth-19
and put him down.

08:55.840 --> 08:57.729
Don't worry. We can help you do that.

08:57.920 --> 09:00.400
We should check and see
if Julian's gotten anything.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.006
I'll go ask him.

09:02.600 --> 09:06.286

What is going on
inside that head of yours?

09:14.320 --> 09:18.484
(SIGHS) This guy knew what was going on
with you and me, and Savitar.

09:19.360 --> 09:20.964
If he knows something
about Savitar, then--

09:21.160 --> 09:23.128
He might be the key to saving you.

09:23.280 --> 09:25.282
This is the first real lead we've gotten.

09:25.480 --> 09:26.811
But, guys, what about Gypsy?

09:27.000 --> 09:29.571
I mean, if she gets a hold of him,
she's gonna take him back to Earth-19.

09:29.800 --> 09:33.327
We can figure that out later.
Right now, we just need to find him.

09:40.760 --> 09:41.761
I got nothing.

09:42.960 --> 09:44.086
Why can't I find you?

09:44.240 --> 09:46.402

You can't just vibe Kadabra's location.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.731
Whatever he's doing,
it renders him invisible to us.

09:51.880 --> 09:53.370
Okay, well, if we can't vibe him,

09:53.520 --> 09:55.284

we'll have to find him another way, right?

11:15.320 --> 11:17.288
Let's grab the speedsters and go.

11:26.320 --> 11:28.448
Man, you just can't help yourself,
can you?

11:30.160 --> 11:31.969
- You brought the whole team this time?
-Mmm-hmm.

11:32.200 --> 11:34.043
<i>ABRA MDABRA: Well, that wasn't
very smart, was it?</i>

11:34.320 --> 11:35.970
Oh. This guy sucks.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.248
I can see
why you wanna bring him down so badly.

11:38.440 --> 11:41.967
Do yourself a favor. Give it up.
There's nowhere for you to go.

11:42.320 --> 11:43.970
You can't out-trick all of us, Kadabra.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.848
Really? I think I just did.

11:49.160 --> 11:50.605
It's a hologram.

11:52.920 --> 11:56.606
Upon further inspection, there was
some rather odd particulate residue

11:56.760 --> 11:58.125
found at Stagg Industries.

11:58.320 --> 12:00.971
Yeah, that's the nanotechnology
that Gypsy was talking about.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.326
But what's it made out of?

12:02.480 --> 12:04.960
Not exactly sure. It's definitely organic,

12:05.160 --> 12:07.925
but it seems to have some sort
of metallic hydrogen properties.

12:08.120 --> 12:09.167
<i>Frankly, it's--</i>

12:09.320 --> 12:11.322
Beyond your understanding.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.130
You make a move, you'll regret it.

12:13.320 --> 12:16.051
Do you know how many times
I've heard that, Detective?

12:19.120 --> 12:20.167
<i>Told you.</i>

12:25.080 --> 12:26.127
Damn it.

12:28.120 --> 12:29.201
Go, go, go!

12:34.200 --> 12:35.201
Guys, move to the side.

12:44.960 --> 12:48.203
Now I can get what I came for.

12:50.080 --> 12:51.491
Everybody okay?

12:53.640 --> 12:55.927
Magic or tech, doesn't matter.
You're not getting out of these.

12:56.080 --> 12:57.241
Maybe not.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.924
You let me go,
I will tell you Savitar's greatest secret.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.731
It's the key to defeating him,
the key to stopping him.

13:04.240 --> 13:05.241
What secret?

13:05.400 --> 13:08.722
I know who he is. I know his name.

13:10.320 --> 13:11.560
Hand him over.

13:24.240 --> 13:25.571
GYPSY: Why'd you lock him up?

13:26.440 --> 13:27.930
I'm taking him right back to my Earth.

13:28.080 --> 13:30.287
Okay, but I need to talk to him first.

13:32.520 --> 13:36.320
Fine. Get what you need from him,
but when you're done, he's mine.

13:41.760 --> 13:44.843
You are gonna die
for all the things you've done.

13:45.480 --> 13:48.563
I cannot wait to see you be put to death.

13:56.520 --> 13:57.931
I'm gonna talk to her.

13:59.080 --> 14:00.491
GYPSY, darling.

14:03.480 --> 14:05.528
You said you knew who Savitar is.

14:05.800 --> 14:09.441
I know everything about the God of Speed.

14:10.520 --> 14:12.602
Hallowed be his name.

14:13.600 --> 14:14.761
Like what?

14:16.200 --> 14:17.565
That he's unstoppable,

14:17.800 --> 14:19.564
<i>that he was the first speedster,</i>

14:20.160 --> 14:22.128
and that you defeat him,

14:22.320 --> 14:26.086
but not until after he takes
what matters the most to you,

14:27.240 --> 14:28.287
Iris West.

14:28.440 --> 14:30.329
Tell us who he is, now.

14:31.280 --> 14:32.645
I don't think so.

14:33.280 --> 14:34.964
<i>It's frustrating, isn't it?</i>

14:35.440 --> 14:40.890
Knowing that you're going to die
unless I give the Flash what he wants.

14:41.480 --> 14:47.761
All that power, all that speed,
and yet you're still too slow.

14:48.640 --> 14:51.928
This isn't a game or a trick.
This is about my daughter's life.

14:52.240 --> 14:56.529
And it's my life
if you hand me over to that collector.

14:57.160 --> 14:58.366
<i>It's simple.</i>

14:59.120 --> 15:03.489
Let me out,
and I'll tell you who Savitar is.

15:03.720 --> 15:07.406
Give me to Gypsy, and Iris dies.

15:07.960 --> 15:10.770
<i>The decision lies with you, Barry.</i>

15:18.800 --> 15:22.441
Guys, we can't let Gypsy take him
before we find out who Savitar is.

15:22.600 --> 15:23.806
No, we cannot.

15:23.960 --> 15:25.246
Then what are we supposed to do?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.842
I don't know.

15:30.240 --> 15:31.685
What is it with you and this guy?

15:31.840 --> 15:33.808
It's like you're hell-bent
on taking him back with you.

15:33.960 --> 15:36.247
He killed a lot of people on Earth-19.

15:36.400 --> 15:37.925
He's killed people here, too.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.406
No one you know or care about.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.725
Did he take somebody from you?

15:45.680 --> 15:47.170
Is that what this is about?

15:47.320 --> 15:50.608
What this is about, Cisco,
is he needs to be brought to justice,

15:50.840 --> 15:55.164
and I am not gonna let anything
or anyone prevent me from doing that.

16:01.320 --> 16:03.687
CAITLIN: You're lucky.
This could've been a lot worse.

16:04.800 --> 16:05.847
I'm fine, really.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.004
"It's merely a flesh wound,"
as the Monty Python boys would say.

16:10.560 --> 16:12.289
Anyway, thanks for patching me up.

16:12.840 --> 16:13.921
Of course.

16:14.720 --> 16:15.721
(WINCES)

16:16.160 --> 16:18.401
Listen, I've been trying to find
the right time to say this,

16:18.600 --> 16:21.649
and now seems to be as good a time as any.

16:24.920 --> 16:29.528
I was so focused
on not hurting you as Killer Frost

16:29.920 --> 16:33.049
that I forgot
that I could hurt you as Caitlin Snow,

16:33.840 --> 16:35.763
and, for that, I'm very sorry.

16:36.120 --> 16:40.205
So I understand
if you don't trust me anymore,

16:40.360 --> 16:44.649
but maybe you can find it in your heart
to forgive me?

16:51.720 --> 16:52.767
You're good to go.

17:09.079 --> 17:10.319
Thank you.

17:12.160 --> 17:13.969
We're gonna figure this out, Barry.

17:14.280 --> 17:15.611
I mean, a guy like Kadabra,

17:15.800 --> 17:18.166
he should have no say
whether you live or die.

17:18.440 --> 17:20.727
How do we even know
that he's telling the truth?

17:20.880 --> 17:23.359
I mean, he's done nothing but tricks
since he got here.

17:23.560 --> 17:25.368
I mean, maybe this is one of them.

17:25.560 --> 17:26.891
It's not, Iris.

17:27.520 --> 17:30.569
So, what, you wanna let him go?

17:32.320 --> 17:33.321
(SIGHS)

17:33.600 --> 17:35.921
I mean, it just feels like our only move.

17:36.720 --> 17:37.960
He's a murderer.

17:38.400 --> 17:41.768
I know he's a murderer, but, I mean,
how many murderers have we put in prison?

17:42.320 --> 17:44.004
How many bad guys have we taken down?

17:44.160 --> 17:46.970
I mean, don't we deserve one win
after everything that we've done?

17:47.120 --> 17:49.964
Life doesn't keep score, Barry.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.210
You should know that better than anyone.

17:54.760 --> 17:57.684
Look, even if Kadabra hadn't shown up,

17:57.840 --> 18:00.047
we'd still be in the same place
we are right now.

18:00.200 --> 18:03.329
But he did, and if he knows
who Savitar is, he's gonna tell us.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.608
- Barry.
-lris, he can save your life.

18:05.760 --> 18:08.161
No, you can save my life.

18:09.120 --> 18:10.246
Not him.

18:11.360 --> 18:15.365
Trust me, I wanna find out who Savitar is
just as badly as you do,

18:15.920 --> 18:18.844
but I don't wanna let someone
who has caused so much pain

18:19.360 --> 18:21.840
walk free just to save my life.

18:23.840 --> 18:27.811
And, you know, deep down,
I don't think you want that either.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.325
I knew you'd come.

18:43.880 --> 18:48.602
'Cause you're the only person
who's willing to do anything.

18:48.760 --> 18:50.046
What do you want?

18:50.720 --> 18:52.131
To be set free.

18:52.880 --> 18:58.489
Murdering people, stealing smart tech.
You came here for something.

18:58.640 --> 19:04.602
Told you before, Detective,
it is beyond your understanding.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.527
This is about my daughter's life.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.002
It's as simple as that for me.

19:12.360 --> 19:15.523
You tell me who Savitar is,

19:16.800 --> 19:18.882
and I will let you go.

19:19.240 --> 19:22.403
You don't, you're going with Gypsy.

19:22.880 --> 19:25.201
A leap of faith for us both, then.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.650
Open the door.

19:29.120 --> 19:32.602
If you take one step before you tell me,

19:32.920 --> 19:34.809
I will blow you away.

No! What the hell are you doing?

-Damn it.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.281

We had a deal.

20:57.720 --> 21:00.371
Your freedom for Savitar's identity.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.727
I've altered the terms of our agreement.

- How bad is it?
-JULIAN: It's bad.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.641
It's bad. There's quite a few pieces
of shrapnel inside you,

and they look deep enough
to pierce your kidney

21:54.520 --> 21:55.567

21:56.040 --> 21:57.405
Guys, we have to get her to a hospital.

21:57.560 --> 21:58.925
We can't. They're gonna ID her as a meta.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.127
Yeah, and not just any meta.

22:00.280 --> 22:02.044

We do have another option.

22:08.120 --> 22:09.167

When Caitlin goes meta,

22:10.480 --> 22:12.687
her metabolic rate
offsets cold-tissue destruction.

22:12.840 --> 22:13.841
She can regenerate?

and a steady set of hands.

You were a field medic
in the Royal Army, right?

22:21.800 --> 22:24.406
What? No, I've never operated
on anyone before.

22:24.560 --> 22:25.766
That's okay. I'll walk you through it.

awake during your own surgery.

The other, to protect my family.

You let him out!

I have been searching for him ever since,
and he finally showed back up.

24:03.280 --> 24:06.966
Ten minutes ago, I had him dead to rights,
and then your friend messed it all up.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.090
So, yes, I do know what it is like

24:09.240 --> 24:11.971
to care about someone so much
that you break the rules.

24:12.120 --> 24:15.124

no matter what.

24:49.280 --> 24:52.250
It's normal for the shrapnel
to cavitate and displace tissue,

24:52.400 --> 24:54.562
but if I lose too much blood,
I'll start hemorrhaging.

24:54.880 --> 24:55.961
Okay.

24:57.080 --> 24:59.082
- IRIS: My God.
-Okay.

24:59.960 --> 25:02.884
All right, nearly done. Nearly done.
Hang in there. Hang in there.

25:03.520 --> 25:04.726
Okay, well done. Well done.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.928
That's all the pieces of shrapnel
from the surface gone.

25:07.080 --> 25:08.570
Okay, great.
Now it's time for the hard one.

25:08.720 --> 25:09.721
But you're doing great.

25:09.920 --> 25:11.604
- You got this, okay, Julian?
-Yes.

25:11.760 --> 25:15.924
It's wedged between my kidney
and my inferior vena cava,

25:16.280 --> 25:19.124
and it's surrounded
by some major blood vessels.

25:19.280 --> 25:21.851
<i>If you hit them,
there's a good chance I'll go into shock.</i>

25:22.040 --> 25:25.601
- Shock?
-But it's okay. You've got this.

25:25.840 --> 25:27.251
Okay. All right.

25:29.160 --> 25:30.207
Heart rate's increasing.

25:30.360 --> 25:31.407
<i>JULIAN: Okay, I think I've got it.</i>

25:31.560 --> 25:32.607
Great, pull it out.

25:32.920 --> 25:34.081
I can't, Caitlin. It's stuck.

25:34.240 --> 25:35.480
CAITLIN: Then turn it.

25:36.120 --> 25:37.121
Guys, it's getting up there.

25:37.280 --> 25:39.601
- It might be a tendon in the way.
-What if it's not a tendon?

25:39.760 --> 25:41.649
Then I will rip this necklace off.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.689
No! I would rather die.

25:45.360 --> 25:47.203
Caitlin, this is going to hurt.

25:55.800 --> 25:58.406
Can you please stitch me up
because I think I need to pass out.

25:58.920 --> 26:02.003
Yes, yes. Of course, of course.
Well done, well done.

26:05.840 --> 26:08.411
- She's gonna be all right.
-Thank God.

26:08.560 --> 26:09.925
That really was amazing, Julian.

26:10.080 --> 26:12.526
Seriously. Julian Albert, MD.

26:13.480 --> 26:15.847
I think I know why Abra Kadabra's
been stealing all that tech.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.764
- Why?
-Build a time machine.

26:20.240 --> 26:22.686
He's trying to get back to the future.

26:42.320 --> 26:43.321
(POWERING UP)

26:43.680 --> 26:44.966
Presto.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.530
What is that thing in his hands?

26:49.680 --> 26:53.890
Everything Kadabra's been stealing,
these are the exact components I used

26:54.040 --> 26:55.929
to build Evil Wells' time sphere
two years ago,

26:56.080 --> 26:58.082
but I could never figure out
what he used for a power source.

26:58.280 --> 26:59.281
<i>I think this is it.</i>

26:59.440 --> 27:01.966
So that's what he took
from the time vault, its power source?

27:02.120 --> 27:04.202
Last thing he needs
to return to the 64th century.

27:04.360 --> 27:07.728
Well, we need to find his ass
before he pulls another disappearing act.

27:07.920 --> 27:10.764
If Kadabra's plan is to Marty McFly
himself back to the future--

27:11.080 --> 27:12.889
He's gonna have
to open a temporal wormhole first.

27:13.080 --> 27:14.411
- And when he does--
-We can nail him.

27:14.680 --> 27:16.762
- Mmm-hmm.
-No, he's mine.

27:17.040 --> 27:19.566
I look forward to showing him
the same mercy he showed my partner.

27:19.720 --> 27:23.042
Hey, Gypsy, you can't go after him alone.

27:23.240 --> 27:24.321
Sure, I can.

27:24.520 --> 27:26.409
You wantjustice
for all those people that he's hurt,

27:26.560 --> 27:28.005
for your partner, right?

27:28.280 --> 27:30.886
Right now, we're trying to prevent
someone we love from getting hurt,

27:31.080 --> 27:32.570
but we can't do that without your help.

27:32.720 --> 27:34.324
I don't trust you guys anymore.

27:34.480 --> 27:36.050
Kadabra's already given
both of us the slip.

27:36.200 --> 27:37.440
If he does it again through time,

27:37.680 --> 27:39.444
I don't think
we get this opportunity back.

27:40.240 --> 27:42.083
Only way we catch him is together.

28:00.120 --> 28:02.122
Guys, Abra Kadabra's
heading south on Ninth.

28:02.320 --> 28:03.651
He opened up a Wormhole.

28:03.880 --> 28:05.245
What do you say?

28:12.120 --> 28:13.121
We can't let him get past us.

28:13.800 --> 28:14.881
We're not gonna do that.

28:15.080 --> 28:16.650
Catch me if you can.

28:21.440 --> 28:24.171
- BARRY: Where's he at?
-He's on State and Main!

28:28.240 --> 28:29.287
CISCO: We're on it!

28:29.560 --> 28:32.291
You shall not pass!

28:42.880 --> 28:43.881
(SCREAMS)

28:48.360 --> 28:50.283
Okay, now he's on Thurlow and Eighth.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.321
We're gonna lose him.

29:02.480 --> 29:05.484
No, we're not.
He's on Seventh, and he's moving fast!

29:17.680 --> 29:18.841
You've got to stop this guy.

29:20.360 --> 29:21.964
Time to go home.

29:25.080 --> 29:26.923
Barr, he opened up another wormhole.

29:48.560 --> 29:51.006
Yes. He did it. He got him.

29:51.480 --> 29:52.606
Thank God.

29:53.440 --> 29:56.205
- So much for your disappearing act.
-No.

30:02.680 --> 30:06.924
By the laws of Earth-19, I hereby collect
you for the crime of mass murder.

30:07.400 --> 30:08.561
Let her take me.

30:09.240 --> 30:13.529
You'll never find out what I know,
and Iris dies.

31:01.800 --> 31:03.529
You've come to see me off.

31:04.720 --> 31:06.449
I'm really touched.

31:10.280 --> 31:11.406
What are we gonna do here?

31:14.640 --> 31:16.165
You're going with her.

31:18.120 --> 31:19.485
I'm not gonna stop her.

31:19.920 --> 31:22.969
Then you'll never find out
what you want to know.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.483
I have nothing to offer you.

31:33.800 --> 31:38.010
No reprieve,
no escape from what you're facing.

31:38.160 --> 31:40.003
You've done some terrible things,

31:41.400 --> 31:43.482
but you are still a man.

31:44.040 --> 31:48.489
You have a family, friends,
people that you care about.

31:50.120 --> 31:53.442
Somewhere inside of you,
there must be a glimmer of light,

31:54.320 --> 31:55.401
of hope.

31:56.440 --> 31:58.807
It's that part of you that I'm asking.

32:00.840 --> 32:02.524
I'm begging.

32:04.320 --> 32:05.685
Help me save her.

32:08.520 --> 32:09.567
Flash.

32:10.880 --> 32:11.961
Begging.

32:14.840 --> 32:18.447
See, here it is. In the future,

32:18.600 --> 32:21.206
you and I have been enemies for years.

32:21.480 --> 32:23.448
There have been others, of course.

32:23.800 --> 32:26.963
There's Thawne, Zoom, DeVoe,

32:27.680 --> 32:30.524
but none of them hurt you like Savitar.

32:31.360 --> 32:33.966
He truly broke you.

32:34.480 --> 32:38.087
I have to be honest.
I was always a little bit jealous.

32:39.000 --> 32:43.050
But now it's like I get to kill her, too.

32:48.720 --> 32:52.770
If you'll excuse me,
I have my execution to attend.

33:07.480 --> 33:09.005
Where does this leave us?

33:11.320 --> 33:12.446
I don't know.

33:12.960 --> 33:14.371
Cisco, I'm...

33:55.720 --> 33:57.051
I'm still here.

33:57.960 --> 33:59.041
Yeah.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.882
Well, I wasn't gonna let you go that easy.

34:02.160 --> 34:03.366
Kadabra?

34:03.720 --> 34:07.088
He's gone. He's gone for good, apparently.

34:08.800 --> 34:12.521
Sorry, my palms are sweaty.

34:12.679 --> 34:13.920
It's quite all right.

34:15.480 --> 34:18.643
Honestly, my stitch work may leave
quite a lot to be desired, so...

34:19.760 --> 34:20.806
It's okay.

34:21.800 --> 34:25.168
I was never much of a two-piece
bathing suit kind of gal anyway.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.128
I cannot believe what you did, Caitlin.

34:30.520 --> 34:34.286
I mean, staying awake
during your own surgery, that's one thing,

34:34.440 --> 34:37.808
but talking my clumsy hands through it,
that's quite the other.

34:38.320 --> 34:40.129
You are immensely brave.

34:40.639 --> 34:44.360
You fought through the pain
like I've never seen anyone before.

34:44.600 --> 34:46.170
You did all the hard work.

34:47.800 --> 34:49.324
Hardly.

34:50.080 --> 34:52.047
You going soft on me, Julian?

34:53.560 --> 34:54.766
Yes.

34:56.360 --> 34:57.521
Absolutely.

35:04.560 --> 35:05.846
-(CAITLIN WINCES)
-(GASPS)

35:06.120 --> 35:07.849
I'm so terribly sorry.

35:09.160 --> 35:10.810
That's most clumsy of me.

35:11.040 --> 35:12.929
Some bedside manner you got there.

35:14.800 --> 35:15.881
I'm working on it.

35:18.880 --> 35:20.120
Just rest.

35:28.920 --> 35:30.001
Here you go.

35:30.520 --> 35:32.488
- Thank you.
-Yeah.

35:35.800 --> 35:36.881
Easy.

35:38.520 --> 35:39.567
Sorry.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.285
I should've been stronger.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.407
You think you should've shot Kadabra?

35:46.920 --> 35:50.402
<i>Dad, I think you showed true strength
by letting him go.</i>

35:50.840 --> 35:52.842
I try to be strong for you guys.

35:53.280 --> 35:55.567
For you, and Wally, and Barry.

35:55.720 --> 35:59.850
Dad, you have been,
and it makes me stronger, too.

36:01.520 --> 36:06.082
When you were a baby, I was terrified

36:06.640 --> 36:08.927
that you might die
in the middle of the night.

36:09.200 --> 36:10.770
I just didn't sleep.

36:12.120 --> 36:15.886
I would just sit in your room

36:17.560 --> 36:18.891
and watch you sleep.

36:20.040 --> 36:22.691
I put my hand on your chest

36:22.840 --> 36:25.969
just to make sure
you were breathing in and out.

36:26.560 --> 36:29.609
I would just sit there praying that

36:33.240 --> 36:35.288
you'd just keep breathing.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.684
<i>That's how I feel right now.</i>

36:44.120 --> 36:46.930
I don't know what I can do to save you.

36:52.560 --> 36:53.891
I know how to save her.

36:55.600 --> 36:56.681
What?

36:57.120 --> 36:58.451
I know how to save her.

36:59.680 --> 37:04.083
Kadabra, Savitar, Thawne,
you know, they're...

37:04.800 --> 37:07.565
They're always one step ahead of us.

37:08.160 --> 37:11.289
For one reason.
They know what's gonna happen.

37:12.160 --> 37:14.481
<i>So, every move we make,
every trap we try and set,</i>

37:14.640 --> 37:16.130
<i>it's all just history to them.</i>

37:16.400 --> 37:17.970
They're armed with the future.

37:18.680 --> 37:20.011
Well, not anymore.

37:20.320 --> 37:21.606
What does that mean?

37:23.120 --> 37:24.451
If the answers that we need

37:24.600 --> 37:27.126
<i>to stop Samar and save you
are 'm the future,</i>

37:27.440 --> 37:29.044
<i>then that's where I need to go.</i>

37:29.520 --> 37:31.409
I'm gonna run to the future.

37:41.160 --> 37:42.491
No more strawberry.

37:42.960 --> 37:44.041
What do you mean,
there's no more strawberry?

37:44.240 --> 37:45.571
I just bought some, like, a week ago.

37:45.720 --> 37:49.805
Yeah, well, I may have eaten some/all.

37:49.960 --> 37:50.961
Cisco.

37:51.160 --> 37:54.050
Do you want me to go out and get you more
strawberry Jell-O? I will get you more.

37:54.200 --> 37:55.201
No, it's fine.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.931
But next time I operate on you,
you're getting bupkis, mister.

37:58.080 --> 38:03.246
Next time you operate on me,
maybe you can fix my broken heart.

38:03.440 --> 38:05.727
I'm sorry it didn't work out
with you and Gypsy.

38:05.960 --> 38:08.645
If two metas from two different universes

38:08.800 --> 38:11.804
with the same vibrational powers
can't make it work,

38:11.960 --> 38:13.849
-then what hope is there?
-(DOOR OPENS)

38:14.040 --> 38:15.041
<i>H.R.: There you guys are.</i>

38:15.240 --> 38:16.321
<i>I've been looking all over for...</i>

38:16.520 --> 38:17.806
What are you doing in bed?

38:18.000 --> 38:20.241
- It's a long story, H.R.
-I have a long story.

38:20.440 --> 38:21.805
Yeah, how about you tell us
where you've been?

38:21.960 --> 38:24.122
Her name is Rhonda,
and she's into new positions.

38:24.320 --> 38:27.369
- We had the--
-Okay. My God, stop talking.

38:27.600 --> 38:30.604
You've got to let somebody know next time
you decide to go on a two-day love romp.

38:31.160 --> 38:33.128
Who was worried about me?

38:33.720 --> 38:35.449
He was. I'm touched.

38:35.640 --> 38:38.484
You'll be touched in the face
with a hammer

38:38.640 --> 38:39.926
the next time
you pull something like that.

38:40.080 --> 38:43.163
Guys, stop it. Don't make me laugh,
or I'll bust my stitches.

38:43.440 --> 38:45.044
Is that lime Jell-O?

38:45.240 --> 38:46.571
It's all you, H.R.

38:46.920 --> 38:48.160
Are you serious?

38:49.080 --> 38:50.081
(LAUGHS)

38:50.720 --> 38:53.371
I love the lime.

38:55.120 --> 38:56.610
I love the lime!

38:57.720 --> 38:59.927
You were really worried about him,
weren't you?

39:00.600 --> 39:03.922
Just promise me
that you'll never ever tell him.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.762
Cross my heart and hope to...

39:12.520 --> 39:13.521
Hey-

39:14.440 --> 39:16.920
Caitlin? Caitlin? Somebody help!

39:17.600 --> 39:19.967
- What happened? What happened?
-I don't know. She just started seizing.

39:20.120 --> 39:23.090
Hold her down. Hold her down!
H.R., grab her legs. Hold her down!

39:23.520 --> 39:24.965
What's happening?

39:28.200 --> 39:29.201
She's not breathing.

39:29.360 --> 39:30.600
We have to get an ambulance
in here right now.

39:30.800 --> 39:33.610
H.R., grab the crash cart.
Cisco, grab the oxygen.

39:33.880 --> 39:35.166
Wheel it over here!

39:36.760 --> 39:38.125
<i>Slow and steady, over her mouth.</i>

39:38.280 --> 39:41.682
Okay, go. Come on, slow and steady.
That's it. That's it.

39:41.840 --> 39:42.841
What's happening?

39:43.000 --> 39:44.161
She may have thrown a blood clot.
I don't know.

JULIAN: Charge the paddles!</i>

39:46.120 --> 39:47.326

- Okay, you're ready.
-Clear!
