WEBVTT

00:04.475 --> 00:06.345
Can you say "newspaper"?

00:08.016 --> 00:10.385
No, that sounds like "newsraper."

00:10.386 --> 00:12.423
- Say "news."
- News.

00:12.424 --> 00:13.726
- "Paper."
- Raper.

00:13.727 --> 00:15.363
Nah, it still sounds like "raper."

00:15.364 --> 00:16.698
Ah, you know what? I got an idea.

00:16.699 --> 00:18.334
Let's try something else. Look at this.

00:18.335 --> 00:20.105
- Can you say "peach"?
- Peach.

00:20.106 --> 00:23.711
Peach. You said it. Do you want it?

00:23.712 --> 00:25.181
Do you want to eat the peach?

00:25.182 --> 00:27.352
All right, here we go.

00:27.353 --> 00:29.758
Oh, my gosh.

00:33.332 --> 00:35.368
You devoured that thing.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.606
Oh, I wish I had more
peaches. That was my lunch.

00:37.607 --> 00:39.142
Customer. Bye.

00:39.143 --> 00:40.645
Hi.

00:40.646 --> 00:42.382
You're the guy who gets rid of ghosts?

00:42.383 --> 00:45.154
Um, I deal with ghosts, yeah.

00:45.155 --> 00:46.489
Okay, look, I have a gig for you.

00:46.490 --> 00:48.226
My father just died, and I found out

00:48.227 --> 00:50.165
that he was keeping a
secret apartment in midtown.

00:50.166 --> 00:51.399
And I would like to hold onto it.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.403
- The secret?
- No, the apartment.

00:53.404 --> 00:55.507
- Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It's in great location,

00:55.508 --> 00:58.212
it's rent controlled. The only problem is

00:58.213 --> 00:59.682
I went in there and there was this, like,

00:59.683 --> 01:02.154
evil cackling coming from inside the walls.

01:02.155 --> 01:04.524
Yeah, okay. Had you told any jokes?

01:04.525 --> 01:06.328
Uh, no.

01:06.329 --> 01:07.498
Maybe it was a nervous laughter.

01:07.499 --> 01:09.636
Right. Look, it doesn't matter.

01:09.637 --> 01:11.705
If you could just look into
it, that would be top-notch.

01:11.706 --> 01:14.111
- You got it. Yeah.
- Here's the address.

01:14.112 --> 01:16.383
The manager will let you
in. Tell him I sent you.

01:16.384 --> 01:18.419
And, uh, that'll be it.

01:18.420 --> 01:20.523
Let me know when you find
something and we can talk money.

01:20.524 --> 01:22.527
Oh, yeah, before you take off,

01:22.528 --> 01:24.532
do you want a candy bar
or something? I got...

01:24.533 --> 01:26.267
No, no. This looks terrible.

01:26.268 --> 01:28.072
Okay, well, to each their zone.

02:06.748 --> 02:10.253
Well, thank you for letting
me in, Mr. Mosalata.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.190
Please. Taro.

02:12.191 --> 02:14.529
So Jeremy said his dad rented this place.

02:14.530 --> 02:17.168
- Did you know him?
- Nah, never met him.

02:17.169 --> 02:19.706
He'd been here for 40 years or something.

02:19.707 --> 02:21.142
Well before I started.

02:21.143 --> 02:22.612
What about paying rent?

02:22.613 --> 02:26.318
Every month a rent check
would slip through the vent

02:26.319 --> 02:27.889
and land on my table.

02:27.890 --> 02:31.797
Until about three months ago
when the rent checks stopped.

02:31.798 --> 02:33.699
So I came up to check on the guy,

02:33.700 --> 02:36.807
- make sure he wasn't dead.
- Sure, yeah, yeah.

02:36.808 --> 02:40.513
He didn't answer, so I let myself in.

02:40.514 --> 02:42.484
But it was just...

02:42.485 --> 02:44.923
like this.

02:44.924 --> 02:48.528
Like no one had been here in decades.

02:48.529 --> 02:51.769
Well, I can see why Jeremy
liked the place so much.

02:51.770 --> 02:54.473
- Well, I'll leave you to it.
- Yeah, thanks, Terry.

02:54.474 --> 02:56.713
- Taro.
- Uh, yeah.

03:04.829 --> 03:06.296
Well, that's stuck.

03:06.297 --> 03:09.437
Gotta be a he-man or something.

03:11.408 --> 03:12.777
"Herro"?

03:15.783 --> 03:17.753
What about this guy?

03:17.754 --> 03:19.923
Oh, it's hinged to the...

03:26.938 --> 03:29.509
Oh.

03:29.510 --> 03:31.546
Awesome.

03:37.459 --> 03:39.496
Oh, cool.

03:43.738 --> 03:45.975
That's awesome.

03:45.976 --> 03:48.680
Whoa.

03:48.681 --> 03:50.350
Herro.

03:50.351 --> 03:52.889
Hey. That's my line.

03:52.890 --> 03:54.858
What is this place, huh?

03:54.859 --> 03:57.397
It's my office.

03:57.398 --> 03:59.768
Uh, who are you?

03:59.769 --> 04:02.941
Master inventor, Rube Goldberg,

04:02.942 --> 04:06.449
perfected the art of
creating complicated machines

04:06.450 --> 04:09.287
built only to complete a simple task.

04:09.288 --> 04:12.460
His intention was to
point out man's capacity

04:12.461 --> 04:16.801
for exerting maximum effort
to accomplish minimum results.

04:16.802 --> 04:19.808
Rube Goldberg.

04:19.809 --> 04:22.546
- Now do you know who I am?
- Yes. Yeah.

04:22.547 --> 04:24.517
Obviously you are the guy who invented

04:24.518 --> 04:25.919
all those Rube Goldberg machines.

04:25.920 --> 04:27.289
Close enough.

04:39.480 --> 04:42.452
Whoa-ho-ho. Well done, sir.

04:43.889 --> 04:47.295
Hi. Uh, sorry, my name is Kevin Pacalioglu.

04:47.296 --> 04:49.866
I've been waiting for
someone like you, Kevin.

04:49.867 --> 04:52.705
I've been waiting for the past 40 years.

04:52.706 --> 04:54.508
- I need your help.
- With what?

04:54.509 --> 04:56.914
Finishing one final machine.

04:56.915 --> 05:00.915
The greatest Rube Goldberg
machine of all time.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.483
My grandfather?

05:15.484 --> 05:18.623
Yeah. Yeah, apparently this
was Rube's secret office.

05:18.624 --> 05:20.727
He put it under your dad's name
so no one would bother him.

05:20.728 --> 05:22.062
Your dad didn't even know.

05:22.063 --> 05:24.501
Wait, Rube Goldberg died in the 1970s.

05:24.502 --> 05:26.638
How does a ghost pay rent for 40 years?

05:26.639 --> 05:28.542
That's the coolest part. Rodrigo here

05:28.543 --> 05:30.446
was holding down the fort the whole time.

05:30.447 --> 05:32.316
How is that even possible?

05:32.317 --> 05:35.288
Oh, Jeremy, let me drop a
little avian knowledge on you.

05:35.289 --> 05:37.660
Parrots can live to be 80
years old in captivity.

05:37.661 --> 05:39.664
They often outlive their owners.

05:39.665 --> 05:41.867
Especially when they've been
taught to feed themselves.

05:41.868 --> 05:43.404
This is how he did it.

05:43.405 --> 05:45.074
He pooped in this little tray right here.

05:45.075 --> 05:47.547
You see that? At the end of every month,

05:47.548 --> 05:49.950
when this got heavy enough
and full of enough bird poo,

05:49.951 --> 05:52.957
it would tip and it would flip
little switch on right here,

05:52.958 --> 05:56.095
causing this contraption to whir to life.

05:56.096 --> 05:57.832
This little arm would write a check,

05:57.833 --> 05:59.970
and this fan would blow it
into the vent right here,

05:59.971 --> 06:02.775
which is directly above the
building manager's office.

06:02.776 --> 06:04.612
That went on for like 40 years.

06:04.613 --> 06:06.349
Until about three months ago,

06:06.350 --> 06:09.087
when your gampy removed
this one domino right here,

06:09.088 --> 06:10.657
stopping the payments.

06:10.658 --> 06:12.061
Why?

06:12.062 --> 06:13.831
I think because he wanted you

06:13.832 --> 06:15.667
to find the place and then hire me.

06:15.668 --> 06:18.807
He wants me to help him
build his final machine.

06:21.347 --> 06:23.817
You know what? Forget it.

06:23.818 --> 06:25.119
Uh, forget what?

06:25.120 --> 06:26.756
The job. Just cancel the job.

06:26.757 --> 06:28.025
I don't want you helping that man.

06:28.026 --> 06:29.494
What? No. Why?

06:29.495 --> 06:31.799
Rube Goldberg destroyed this family.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.402
I don't want you helping him move on

06:33.403 --> 06:35.006
or find peace or any of that.

06:35.007 --> 06:36.842
He can rot away as a ghost for all I care.

06:36.843 --> 06:38.479
Good day to you, sir.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.383
No, see, ghosts don't rot, first of all.

06:40.384 --> 06:42.621
They kind of just like look
the same as they did when...

06:42.622 --> 06:45.493
Oh, shoot. Hey, what the hell, man?

06:45.494 --> 06:48.699
What... what about the money?

06:48.700 --> 06:50.568
I can pay you.

06:50.569 --> 06:53.776
If you finish this job, I'll
pay you whatever you want.

06:53.777 --> 06:55.613
Yeah. Yeah, I don't know, Rube.

06:55.614 --> 06:57.683
I've had lots of ghost clients before

06:57.684 --> 06:59.988
and they always seem to have
trouble opening their wallets,

06:59.989 --> 07:02.125
- if you know what I mean.
- I'm different.

07:02.126 --> 07:05.565
I was able to pay rent for
the past 40 years, right?

07:05.566 --> 07:06.934
That's true, you did.

07:06.935 --> 07:08.906
How does $10,000 sound?

07:08.907 --> 07:10.809
Ten thousand dollars? That's amazing.

07:10.810 --> 07:12.913
That, like, would change my whole life.

07:12.914 --> 07:15.017
You got yourself a deal, sir.

07:15.018 --> 07:17.923
All right, there are three items I need

07:17.924 --> 07:19.559
to complete my machine.

07:19.560 --> 07:22.632
The first item is a very special prototype

07:22.633 --> 07:24.101
for a new kind of spring.

07:24.102 --> 07:27.708
There is only one in existence.

07:27.709 --> 07:29.980
You'll pretend to be delivering fruit.

07:29.981 --> 07:32.618
No one ever questions a fruit basket.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.122
Can I help you?

07:34.123 --> 07:36.426
- Uh, yeah, I got some fruit.
- Qaddumi.

07:36.427 --> 07:38.797
Where is that spring catalogue?

07:38.798 --> 07:40.567
- Which one?
- The winter catalogue

07:40.568 --> 07:42.137
with the new spring collection.

07:42.138 --> 07:44.174
Uh, tomorrow, tomorrow, the latest.

07:44.175 --> 07:47.013
If we don't have that winter
catalogue by noon tomorrow,

07:47.014 --> 07:48.215
you're sprung.

07:48.216 --> 07:50.119
You can't just spring that on me.

07:50.120 --> 07:52.657
What does your little
lucky 7 ball say, huh?

07:52.658 --> 07:53.926
Does it say you're the boss?

07:53.927 --> 07:55.898
Or does it say I'm the boss?

07:55.899 --> 07:58.736
The next item is a four-hole bowling ball.

07:58.737 --> 08:02.745
There's one Alley in New York
where I know this ball exists.

08:08.990 --> 08:11.894
Who would ever need a four-hole ball?

08:11.895 --> 08:14.568
A guy with six fingers.

08:19.578 --> 08:22.649
Excuse me. Uh, still using that ball.

08:22.650 --> 08:24.552
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm always doing that. Yeah.

08:24.553 --> 08:26.056
Can't we just, uh...?

08:26.057 --> 08:27.960
Ah! Damn it!

08:27.961 --> 08:30.500
You broke my finger! Gah! Damn.

08:35.977 --> 08:37.945
The final item on the list

08:37.946 --> 08:41.720
The kindergarten class pet at
Charles Bukowski Elementary.

08:41.721 --> 08:44.259
It's a hamster. Not any hamster.

08:44.260 --> 08:47.131
It's a blind hamster.

08:50.171 --> 08:52.507
Oi, look at this wanker.

08:52.508 --> 08:54.646
What? Oh.

08:54.647 --> 08:56.583
Oh, ha-ha.

08:56.584 --> 08:58.986
Okay, very funny, guys. Step aside.

08:58.987 --> 09:01.993
Sorry, mate. You gotta pay the toll.

09:01.994 --> 09:04.799
Uh, no. No, I don't, because I'm an adult

09:04.800 --> 09:07.136
and adults don't pay tolls, genius.

09:07.137 --> 09:10.543
Ah! Where does that
come from? Was that you?

09:10.544 --> 09:12.046
Why would you do that? What are you...?

09:12.047 --> 09:13.916
What are you, little David Beckham?

09:13.917 --> 09:17.190
You've got quite the leg for
a 10-year-old. That stings.

09:19.728 --> 09:22.535
Oh. Hey, guys. You turned
my grapes into raisins.

09:30.010 --> 09:31.249
Hey.

09:31.250 --> 09:32.549
Hey, man, where the hell you been?

09:32.550 --> 09:34.089
You know how I am on punctuality.

09:34.090 --> 09:36.189
Yeah, I'm sorry, Roof, I tried to call.

09:36.190 --> 09:39.329
You know what? Take one
of my burner phones, man.

09:39.330 --> 09:42.599
Hey, Roof, when someone is,
like, super intimidating,

09:42.600 --> 09:44.609
but they're the only thing
standing in the way of you

09:44.610 --> 09:46.709
receiving some, like, life-changing reward,

09:46.710 --> 09:48.649
what's the best way to, uh...

09:48.650 --> 09:51.949
- bypass them completely?
- Hmm.

09:51.950 --> 09:54.220
The way I see it, man,
you gotta face your fears.

09:54.230 --> 09:57.329
You know. Like, I had a fear
of abandonment as a child.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.639
And...

09:59.640 --> 10:02.139
and now my fears came back.

10:06.320 --> 10:07.519
Hey, you.

10:07.520 --> 10:10.319
And you.

10:10.320 --> 10:12.329
I thought you weren't
ready for a relationship.

10:12.330 --> 10:15.069
And here you are on a date.

10:15.070 --> 10:17.700
With a very famous detective, no less.

10:17.710 --> 10:21.279
Uh, which... Oh, that actually means

10:21.280 --> 10:23.279
that you... you are
ready for a relationship.

10:23.280 --> 10:26.989
Perhaps my gentle let-downs
haven't been explicit enough

10:26.990 --> 10:30.729
to get through to your
sourdough bread bowl of a brain.

10:30.730 --> 10:33.439
Let me make myself perfectly clear.

10:33.440 --> 10:37.339
I would never date anyone like you.

10:37.340 --> 10:38.979
Ever.

10:38.980 --> 10:42.689
In fact, the only reason I might consider

10:42.690 --> 10:46.529
having you around is
because when I look at you,

10:46.530 --> 10:48.460
it makes me not want to eat.

10:48.470 --> 10:50.230
I'd just like to chime
in here for a minute.

10:50.240 --> 10:52.669
I'm not, uh, I'm not actually a detective.

10:52.670 --> 10:56.009
Um, I'm a, ahem, highly
acclaimed television actor.

10:56.010 --> 10:57.549
I could be doing movies too,

10:57.550 --> 11:01.089
- but I prefer...
- Fitz. Shut the (Bleep) up.

11:01.090 --> 11:04.229
The point is, is that Paul Fitzgerald

11:04.230 --> 11:08.339
is attractive, successful, and a homeowner.

11:08.340 --> 11:09.639
You, on the other hand,

11:09.640 --> 11:12.310
will never amount to anything.

11:15.650 --> 11:17.489
You know something?

11:17.490 --> 11:21.659
You are nothing like the
sweet, and kind Camomile

11:21.660 --> 11:23.269
I used to dream of growing old with.

11:23.270 --> 11:25.139
And you.

11:25.140 --> 11:28.109
You are nothing like the
smooth and confident detective

11:28.110 --> 11:30.249
that you play on the TV.

11:30.250 --> 11:34.250
Which I guess, makes you a
really amazing actor, actually.

11:34.590 --> 11:36.589
- So good for you.
- Namaste.

11:36.590 --> 11:38.629
And you're wrong about me, Camomile.

11:38.630 --> 11:41.099
I will not never amount to nothing.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.569
I'm... I will not...

11:42.570 --> 11:44.370
Get out.

11:44.380 --> 11:45.480
Out.

11:49.220 --> 11:51.519
How does $10,000 sound?

11:51.520 --> 11:53.259
Ten thousand dollars? That's amazing.

11:53.260 --> 11:55.659
That, like, would change my whole life.

11:55.660 --> 11:59.269
You will never amount to anything.

11:59.270 --> 12:02.339
The way I see it, man,
you gotta face your fears.

12:03.710 --> 12:07.710
I did not have sexual
relations with that woman.

12:25.360 --> 12:27.089
All right, listen up, snot wads.

12:27.090 --> 12:29.629
Step aside before I clean your clocks off.

12:29.630 --> 12:31.529
Is that a fact, wanker?

12:31.530 --> 12:33.570
- What's a "fackwanker"?
- Hit him.

12:44.630 --> 12:46.559
Oh, what just happened?

12:46.560 --> 12:47.770
- Get out of here!
- Let's go.

13:44.910 --> 13:47.650
Hey, little fella. Don't be afraid.

13:49.190 --> 13:51.389
Take you out on a little adventure.

13:51.390 --> 13:53.529
Who the hell are you?

13:53.530 --> 13:55.159
- Who am I?
- Yes.

13:55.160 --> 13:59.160
I'm... I'm 24601.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.679
I'm employee number 24601
from the hamster division.

14:01.680 --> 14:04.279
It's a mandatory hamster inspection.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.219
I'll just borrow this guy
and get him out of your hair.

14:06.220 --> 14:07.859
Excuse me. There is a sign-up
sheet for Mr. Wibbles.

14:07.860 --> 14:09.520
You need to sign him out.

14:09.530 --> 14:12.660
Oh, yeah, if you could just
bump me up on the list...

14:12.670 --> 14:14.199
Listen, I don't make the rules.

14:14.200 --> 14:16.639
- Oh...
- Thank you.

14:16.640 --> 14:18.639
What is that man doing?

14:18.640 --> 14:21.949
- Honey, he's checking...
- Is he taking Mr. Wibbles?

14:21.950 --> 14:25.259
Child, it's fine. I'm
just borrowing Mr. Wibbles

14:25.260 --> 14:26.929
so I can shove him inside of a machine.

14:26.930 --> 14:29.659
No! He's stealing Mr. Wibbles!

14:29.660 --> 14:30.869
No, I'm not stealing...

14:30.870 --> 14:32.900
Get out or I will extinguish you.

14:32.910 --> 14:34.680
No, no, no. I... ow! Ow! Ow!

14:37.850 --> 14:39.420
You're okay.

14:40.820 --> 14:42.260
Get out!

14:54.280 --> 14:56.549
Hey, Rube. Where's the parrot?

14:56.550 --> 15:00.359
I let rodrigo fly out the window.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.359
His work here was done.

15:02.360 --> 15:03.799
He earned his freedom.

15:03.800 --> 15:05.669
Cool.

15:05.670 --> 15:07.939
Of course, New York City's not
a natural habitat for a parrot.

15:07.940 --> 15:10.009
He'll most likely be dead in a week.

15:10.010 --> 15:14.010
Anyway, I got all the
stuff for which you asked.

15:14.650 --> 15:16.419
Look at this.

15:16.420 --> 15:17.660
Arab spring.

15:19.760 --> 15:21.299
Four-hole bowling ball.

15:21.300 --> 15:22.699
Lookit. Yeah.

15:22.700 --> 15:25.809
And last, but not least, your blind ham...

15:25.810 --> 15:27.309
Oh, no!

15:27.310 --> 15:28.910
Oh, my God.

15:28.920 --> 15:31.649
Oh, he was recovering so nicely.

15:31.650 --> 15:34.729
You should know that I actually
don't need any of these.

15:34.730 --> 15:36.890
- You don't need any of these?
- Uh-uh.

15:36.900 --> 15:38.829
Do you have any idea how difficult it was

15:38.830 --> 15:40.569
for me to get this stuff?

15:40.570 --> 15:42.509
There's a teacher at
Bakowski Elementary School

15:42.510 --> 15:43.709
with a broken leg.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.009
Snapped in half.

15:45.010 --> 15:46.479
Sarah will be fine.

15:46.480 --> 15:47.919
She's gonna be f...

15:47.920 --> 15:50.450
Wait a sec. What are you...?
How did you know her name?

15:50.460 --> 15:51.889
My whole life had been devoted

15:51.890 --> 15:55.829
to creating these complex machines.

15:55.830 --> 15:58.809
I kept thinking, "what's next?"

15:58.810 --> 16:04.619
When I died, I found that I had
completely neglected my family.

16:04.620 --> 16:08.620
That's when I realized that
our actions have consequences.

16:09.860 --> 16:11.859
Real consequences.

16:11.860 --> 16:14.699
That's when it struck me.

16:14.700 --> 16:17.409
What if I could build a machine

16:17.410 --> 16:20.309
that relied not only on physical dominoes,

16:20.310 --> 16:22.919
but metaphysical ones as well?

16:22.920 --> 16:25.929
What if I could create an event

16:25.930 --> 16:28.729
that led to another event

16:28.730 --> 16:32.039
that led to another event?

16:32.040 --> 16:33.870
And so forth.

16:33.880 --> 16:36.779
So am I supposed to be
one of those meta...?

16:36.780 --> 16:38.679
- Metaphysical dominoes.
- Yeah.

16:38.680 --> 16:40.489
Metaphysical dominoes. Am I one of those?

16:40.490 --> 16:42.820
No. You, Kevin, were necessary

16:42.830 --> 16:46.399
to put the metaphysical dominoes in place.

16:46.400 --> 16:49.809
And now, the machine is ready.

16:49.810 --> 16:53.509
Please, would you do me the honor?

16:53.510 --> 16:55.849
Push that domino over.

16:55.850 --> 16:57.719
- That one right there?
- Yes.

16:57.720 --> 16:59.730
Yeah.

17:05.599 --> 17:07.409
The other way, genius.

17:07.410 --> 17:09.579
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I
knew that. There we go.

17:26.609 --> 17:27.710
Ow!

17:45.720 --> 17:48.449
The winter catalog never arrived
and we missed the deadline.

17:48.450 --> 17:50.089
The spring collection is ruined.

17:50.090 --> 17:51.489
You're fired!

18:05.850 --> 18:08.589
No, no. I said "lawsuit."
Not "clothing suit."

18:08.590 --> 18:09.959
Why would I need a lawsuit dry-cleaned?

18:09.960 --> 18:12.070
Is that a parrot?

18:19.650 --> 18:23.150
Okay, now listen. This
buzzer's broken over here

18:23.160 --> 18:26.729
so if you need me, you just
pull this string on the side.

18:26.730 --> 18:28.729
It runs the whole length of the hallway,

18:28.730 --> 18:32.739
and it attaches to a see-saw
thing that'll ring a bell.

18:32.740 --> 18:34.779
I know it's super janky,

18:34.780 --> 18:36.009
but it's like one of those, you know,

18:36.010 --> 18:37.679
mouse trap kind of thingies.

18:37.680 --> 18:39.049
It's a Rube Goldberg machine.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.959
That's funny.

18:42.960 --> 18:45.029
- What's funny about that?
- No, nothing.

18:45.030 --> 18:47.970
It's just, uh, Rube Goldberg
was actually my grandfather.

18:51.110 --> 18:52.880
Rube Goldberg was my grandfather.

18:59.130 --> 19:00.529
Hello?

19:00.530 --> 19:01.729
Mr. Mosalata.

19:01.730 --> 19:02.999
Please. Taro.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.669
Taro, hey, it's Jeremy Goldberg.

19:05.670 --> 19:07.939
Listen, I think I'm going to keep

19:07.940 --> 19:09.709
- that apartment after all.
- Are you sure?

19:09.710 --> 19:11.879
Yeah. I just ran into my long-lost cousin

19:11.880 --> 19:13.549
who I'd never met,

19:13.550 --> 19:15.820
and the fact that we have
the same grandfather,

19:15.830 --> 19:18.159
the very man who rented that apartment,

19:18.160 --> 19:21.169
I... I don't know. It
seems like it's a sign.

19:21.170 --> 19:23.809
Like it's all part of some bigger plan.

19:23.810 --> 19:26.009
- I'll start the paperwork.
- Thanks.

19:26.010 --> 19:27.949
Oh, one thing that's definitely, you know,

19:27.950 --> 19:29.180
not part of the bigger plan.

19:29.190 --> 19:30.589
That broken window,

19:30.590 --> 19:31.789
can you fix that?

19:31.790 --> 19:33.029
I'll take a look at it.

19:33.030 --> 19:34.630
Okay. Thanks.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.050
Night's coming.

20:04.290 --> 20:05.689
Oh.

20:07.030 --> 20:08.629
Wow.

20:08.630 --> 20:10.999
Oh, my God.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.939
That was amazing.

20:12.940 --> 20:14.569
I mean, I still like the hand-clapping one,

20:14.570 --> 20:15.770
but that was cool.

20:15.780 --> 20:19.719
Oh, Rube, you are awesome.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.549
Wait. Oh...

20:21.550 --> 20:23.159
Wait, Rube.

20:23.160 --> 20:24.959
How am I supposed to
get my... my ten grand?

20:24.960 --> 20:26.959
Oh, freaking a! I knew it.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.169
Ah...

20:28.170 --> 20:31.039
Ugh, who's this?

20:31.040 --> 20:32.809
Roofie, it's a bad time, man.

20:32.810 --> 20:34.240
No, no. Wait, wait. This is good.

20:34.250 --> 20:35.749
Yo, check this, man.

20:35.750 --> 20:36.949
So I'm taking a taxi yesterday.

20:36.950 --> 20:38.819
All of a sudden a paper airplane

20:38.820 --> 20:40.759
flies through the window,

20:40.760 --> 20:42.929
hits the cab driver in
the face out of nowhere.

20:42.930 --> 20:44.199
We swerve,

20:44.200 --> 20:46.769
hit a town car, right?

20:46.770 --> 20:48.809
- Guess who's town car we hit.
- Uh, James McAvoy?

20:48.810 --> 20:50.009
No.

20:50.010 --> 20:51.309
Steve Myer.

20:51.310 --> 20:53.919
Steven Myer is the mayor of New York.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.089
- We elected a mayor Myer?
- I know, right?

20:56.090 --> 20:57.289
But check this out.

20:57.290 --> 20:58.809
Me and him get to talking,

20:58.810 --> 21:00.179
we chatting, right?

21:00.180 --> 21:01.979
And I asked him, I say, "yo, what's taking

21:01.980 --> 21:05.749
so freaking long with the
Second Ave. Subway line?"

21:05.750 --> 21:08.619
Yo, get this. He says the
workers don't want to work,

21:08.620 --> 21:10.949
because it might be haunted.

21:10.950 --> 21:12.619
Subway ghosts.

21:12.620 --> 21:14.119
Yup.

21:14.120 --> 21:17.160
Short story long, how would
you like to make $10,000?
