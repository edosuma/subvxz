WEBVTT

00:09.477 --> 00:12.346
ANNOUNCER:
Crescent City, give it up
for the Navy's very own...

00:12.380 --> 00:15.283
Golden Aces!

00:16.284 --> 00:18.086
Danny, phone.

00:18.119 --> 00:19.687
I'm texting Shay.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.689
He's got a thing
for Shay.
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

00:21.722 --> 00:22.090
I'm aware.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.227
CJ:
Whoa!

00:26.260 --> 00:28.196
That was tight!

00:28.229 --> 00:29.797
Right, D?

00:29.830 --> 00:31.799
It was pretty
cool, I guess.

00:31.832 --> 00:34.768
See? When you
open your eyes,

00:34.802 --> 00:36.770
look what surprises
life gives you.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.272
ANNOUNCER:
In a few minutes,

00:38.306 --> 00:40.241
American hero,
Lieutenant Lindsay Garrett.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.144
Ready, kid?

00:43.177 --> 00:44.445
I was born ready, old man.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.448
You're looking
a little pale.

00:47.481 --> 00:48.616
You good?

00:48.649 --> 00:50.084
Absolutely.

00:50.118 --> 00:52.220
Let's do this.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.155
ANNOUNCER:
Please put your hands together

00:54.188 --> 00:56.324
for New Orleans' own
Lindsay Garrett,

00:56.357 --> 00:59.427
flying the Navy's
brand-new fighter jet,

00:59.460 --> 01:01.662
the A06 Skystormer!

01:13.374 --> 01:17.211
CONTROLLER: Runway 3 waiting.
You are clear for takeoff.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.283
Yeah, yeah!

01:43.337 --> 01:44.805
Oh!
Whoa-ho-ho!

01:51.245 --> 01:53.113
Whoa!
Whoa!

01:58.486 --> 02:00.188
The plane don't
look too good.

02:09.363 --> 02:11.699
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:11.732 --> 02:14.335
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

02:14.368 --> 02:16.770
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:16.804 --> 02:17.938
* How, how, how, how

02:17.971 --> 02:20.274
* Hey, hey

02:26.447 --> 02:27.648
* You gotta come on.

02:29.383 --> 02:31.719
So clown shows up
half hour late,

02:31.752 --> 02:33.354
in a janky-ass
track suit,

02:33.387 --> 02:34.955
and barbecue stains
down the front.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.490
What'd you do?

02:36.524 --> 02:38.792
I was, like, "Bye, Felicia."
Gonna have to take

02:38.826 --> 02:40.528
a whole lot more
effort than that

02:40.561 --> 02:42.330
to get with all of this.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.399
How about you, Ms. Thing?

02:45.433 --> 02:47.835
How's, uh, the
roving reporter?

02:47.868 --> 02:50.804
You know, ex-fiancÃ©
with the Hugh Grant accent.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.274
That's on an... as-needed basis.

02:53.307 --> 02:55.343
James is on assignment in Kenya.

02:55.376 --> 02:56.710
So you playing the field?

02:56.744 --> 02:58.512
I'm open to it
if something interesting

02:58.546 --> 02:59.880
comes along, yeah.

02:59.913 --> 03:02.550
Kudos to you
for having standards.

03:03.617 --> 03:06.520
Unlike Mr. Walk of
Shame over here.

03:06.554 --> 03:08.489
I don't even want to know
what kind of suck-face scars

03:08.522 --> 03:10.258
you got going on
under that collar.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.392
I got nothing to hide.

03:11.425 --> 03:12.660
Rough night, Lasalle, huh?

03:12.693 --> 03:14.662
If by "rough, you
mean legendary.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.297
My man,

03:16.330 --> 03:18.432
were we on fire last night,
or what?

03:18.466 --> 03:20.734
Hold up, you two
went out together?

03:20.768 --> 03:23.437
The image of Patton Plame
twerking on a bar

03:23.471 --> 03:25.339
is not gonna be
easy to erase.

03:25.373 --> 03:26.640
Oh, I got

03:26.674 --> 03:28.642
my ways.
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:28.676 --> 03:30.578
I must have lost the evite.

03:30.611 --> 03:33.747
What about you, B?
Probably in
my spam folder.

03:33.781 --> 03:36.450
It's Pride.
Better get that joe to go.

03:36.484 --> 03:38.486
Plane crash
to investigate.

03:42.723 --> 03:46.026
WADE: The victim's
Lieutenant Lindsay Garrett,

03:46.059 --> 03:47.761
age 26.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.699
She was the first
female combat pilot

03:51.732 --> 03:54.935
to receive a Silver Star
for bravery

03:54.968 --> 03:57.471
after leading a mission
to Syria.

03:57.505 --> 03:59.407
Took out a band
of insurgents,

03:59.440 --> 04:02.510
saved hundreds
of innocent civilians.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.445
You brought the boys
to see her?

04:04.478 --> 04:06.847
Yeah. I thought it'd be
a fun family day.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.716
Didn't work out so well.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.552
Single mother at 50.
Ah. Working on it.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.288
Okay, so far,
fragmentation patterns

04:14.322 --> 04:16.424
to the lower body and torso.

04:18.326 --> 04:19.960
Multiple blunt injuries
to the head.

04:19.993 --> 04:21.962
It's typical of
catastrophic accidents.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.531
WOMAN:
Agent Pride.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.468
Madam Secretary.
You're here fast.

04:27.501 --> 04:28.802
I was attending
the air show.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.571
Do you know Doc Wade?
Yeah.
Ma'am.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.874
Lieutenant Garrett
was a hero.

04:33.907 --> 04:36.610
: A role model
for the Navy.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.078
Loss is immeasurable.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.713
For a multitude
of reasons.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.615
The Skystormer's a
crucial component

04:41.649 --> 04:43.451
of the Navy's
defense arsenal.

04:43.484 --> 04:46.053
For that reason, Melanie Pratt,
the jet contractor,

04:46.086 --> 04:47.488
Curtwell Industries' liaison

04:47.521 --> 04:50.424
to the Navy,
is here to provide full support.

04:50.458 --> 04:51.625
Whatever you need, Agent Pride.

04:51.659 --> 04:54.628
History and specs on the plane
would be great.

04:54.662 --> 04:56.764
I'll call my office, have them
send over the complete files.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.466
Thank you.

04:59.467 --> 05:00.801
Three weeks ago,

05:00.834 --> 05:02.736
POTUS approved shipment
of the Skystormer

05:02.770 --> 05:05.506
to strategically located
bases around the globe

05:05.539 --> 05:07.908
as part of a large-scale
defense strategy.

05:07.941 --> 05:10.744
But until we're certain
of what caused this crash,

05:10.778 --> 05:12.346
that rollout has
been held up.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.381
Leaving the Navy vulnerable.

05:13.414 --> 05:16.016
We need to find out
what caused the accident.

05:16.049 --> 05:18.652
The plane or the pilot.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.522
Counting on you, Dwayne,
and your team

05:21.555 --> 05:23.023
to make this happen.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.092
We won't let you down.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.495
It's Washington.
Excuse me.

05:27.528 --> 05:29.597
The black box
is uploaded, King.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.632
Be right there.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.569
MAN: According
to the flight data recorder,

05:35.603 --> 05:38.872
Lieutenant Garrett started
having trouble 46 seconds in,

05:38.906 --> 05:41.575
which is when she
stopped communicating
with flight control.

05:41.609 --> 05:43.411
Her comms go out?
Flight data confirms

05:43.444 --> 05:45.446
they were functional,
but no distress call.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.548
Shortly after last contact,
plane's flight pattern

05:47.581 --> 05:49.517
was overridden
by the ACLS.

05:50.618 --> 05:51.652
ACLS?

05:51.685 --> 05:53.454
Aircraft Carrier Landing System.

05:53.487 --> 05:54.922
Advanced technology
designed to land planes

05:54.955 --> 05:56.590
onto aircraft carriers.

05:56.624 --> 05:59.026
Carriers have shorter
landing strips than airfields.

05:59.059 --> 06:01.562
PRATT: To compensate,
the ACLS sends the plane

06:01.595 --> 06:03.631
into a rapid descent,
followed by a condensed landing

06:03.664 --> 06:04.998
buffered
by the ship's tail hooks.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.801
But if the function was
initiated mid-flight...

06:07.835 --> 06:09.970
It would send the plane
into a steep nosedive.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.806
And without tail hooks to help
bring the plane to a halt...

06:12.840 --> 06:14.107
It'd be a death trap.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.509
MAN:
Plane dropped a thousand feet

06:15.543 --> 06:16.844
at close to 300 miles an hour.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.046
A pilot of Garrett's caliber
would understand

06:19.079 --> 06:21.715
the ramifications
of initiating such a function.
Yeah.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.517
Software glitch?
PRATT:
Not possible.

06:23.551 --> 06:25.986
Once airborne, the only way
to initiate the ACLS

06:26.019 --> 06:27.888
is manually-- from the cockpit.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.957
And once it was triggered,
Lieutenant Garrett

06:29.990 --> 06:32.493
made no attempt
to course-correct or eject.

06:32.526 --> 06:36.530
So it's possible that this is...
not an accident after all.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.999
Possible the Navy's finest...

06:39.032 --> 06:42.603
crashed her plane
into the ground on purpose.

06:55.683 --> 06:58.719
LINDSAY: Picture yourself
hurtling through the air

06:58.752 --> 06:59.987
at 1,500 miles an hour,

07:00.020 --> 07:02.756
ten tons of titanium
strapped to your person.

07:02.790 --> 07:05.225
That's what it's like
being a fighter pilot.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.829
Closest you can get
to being part machine.

07:08.862 --> 07:11.499
MAN :
Are you ever afraid?

07:11.532 --> 07:13.601
Well, if I was,
do you think I'd admit it?

07:14.902 --> 07:17.771
No, the...

07:17.805 --> 07:19.507
difference between
life and death up there

07:19.540 --> 07:21.074
is being able
to compartmentalize the fear.

07:21.108 --> 07:24.144
Put it in a box
and get the job done.

07:24.177 --> 07:25.879
Lieutenant Lindsay Garrett,

07:25.913 --> 07:28.015
second-generation
military pilot.

07:28.048 --> 07:31.919
Graduated top of her class
at Naval Fighter Weapons School.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.021
After Garrett was awarded
the Silver Star

07:34.054 --> 07:35.889
for her mission in Syria,
she garnered

07:35.923 --> 07:38.158
national attention.
SONJA: No doubt. Homegirl's

07:38.191 --> 07:39.727
a media darling.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.630
New York Post, Top Trends,
Celebrity Beat.

07:42.663 --> 07:44.231
LASALLE:
Smart, strong,

07:44.264 --> 07:46.266
easy on the eyes--
total package.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.936
PRIDE: Yet we're supposed to
believe she killed herself and

07:48.969 --> 07:51.639
put a multimillion-dollar jet

07:51.672 --> 07:53.140
into the ground.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.042
Why?

07:56.944 --> 07:59.647
Chris, Brody,
head to Belle Chase.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.048
Look into Garrett's
mental state

08:01.081 --> 08:02.816
in the days leading
up to the air show.

08:02.850 --> 08:05.018
I'll have Patton check
into her digital footprint.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.920
Percy, stay on top of
Wade and Sebastian.

08:06.954 --> 08:09.557
MAN:
Agent Pride.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.561
I'm here about my daughter.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.028
My wife Sandra died

08:15.062 --> 08:17.865
when Lindsay was just seven.

08:19.232 --> 08:22.603
Pretty much just been
the two of us after that.

08:24.605 --> 08:27.107
Must have been tough.
We managed.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.677
Used to take Lindz out
in the Cessna on the weekends.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.646
Kid never wanted to come down.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.314
Said she loved
being up so high,

08:34.347 --> 08:35.983
so close to the sun.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.585
We're sorry for your loss.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.152
I understand
you were...

08:39.186 --> 08:41.689
with your daughter

08:41.722 --> 08:43.190
before the show.

08:46.093 --> 08:49.663
Did you notice anything...

08:49.697 --> 08:52.032
:
I don't know...

08:52.065 --> 08:53.667
off?

08:53.701 --> 08:54.935
With Lindsay?
Captain,

08:54.968 --> 08:56.136
they're asking questions

08:56.169 --> 08:57.938
about your daughter's actions

08:57.971 --> 08:59.840
in the cockpit.
I've been in the service

08:59.873 --> 09:02.042
more than half my life--
I know how this works.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.277
How's that?
Business of war.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.146
Fancy new jet
comes with agendas.

09:06.179 --> 09:08.982
Multimillion-dollar toy gets
a glitch, now, that's a problem.

09:09.016 --> 09:12.319
But... something wrong
with the pilot?

09:12.352 --> 09:14.822
That they can live with.

09:14.855 --> 09:17.625
My job here is just...

09:17.658 --> 09:20.127
is simply to find the truth.
The truth...

09:20.160 --> 09:22.262
is my daughter was
an exemplary pilot,

09:22.295 --> 09:23.330
as competent
and capable

09:23.363 --> 09:25.165
as anyone out there, any age,

09:25.198 --> 09:26.834
male or female.

09:26.867 --> 09:27.968
SONJA:
Excuse me.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.236
Doc Wade.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.238
Says she got something.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.140
WADE:
Upon examining

09:33.173 --> 09:36.143
the victim, I found
several traumatic injuries,

09:36.176 --> 09:40.113
but it's likely the fatal blow
was to the skull.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.049
PRIDE:
Hey, Danny, how you doing?

09:42.082 --> 09:44.017
Good.
Cool?

09:44.051 --> 09:46.119
Yes, sir.
WADE: Danny,
where's Lieutenant...

09:46.153 --> 09:47.988
Garrett's paperwork?

09:48.021 --> 09:50.590
Filed it, just
like you asked.

09:52.159 --> 09:54.327
No, these are alphabetical--
I asked you

09:54.361 --> 09:56.664
to file it
by medical code.

09:56.697 --> 09:59.199
Sorry. I forgot.
Danny,

09:59.232 --> 10:00.868
this internship
is an opportunity,

10:00.901 --> 10:03.103
which means...
rising to the task,

10:03.136 --> 10:05.806
diligence
and attention to detail.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.040
I know.

10:07.074 --> 10:08.809
Every fact in
its place...

10:08.842 --> 10:10.143
Brings the truth to bear.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.646
Yes.
She says that a lot.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.815
Believe me, I know.
WADE:
So...

10:14.848 --> 10:17.818
along with
the subdural hematoma

10:17.851 --> 10:19.052
on the right frontal lobe

10:19.086 --> 10:21.021
caused by the impact
of the crash,

10:21.054 --> 10:23.090
something else caught my eye.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.391
Her eyes.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.393
Ruptured blood vessels.

10:26.426 --> 10:27.928
Indicative of G-LOC.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.730
Exposure to excessive G

10:29.763 --> 10:32.733
Statistically, G-LOC is
one of the most common causes

10:32.766 --> 10:35.002
of pilot-error crashes.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.670
Loss of blood
to the brain

10:36.704 --> 10:38.706
leads to impaired vision,

10:38.739 --> 10:41.074
disorientation,
blackouts.

10:41.108 --> 10:43.711
All reasons Garrett
could have triggered the ACLS.

10:43.744 --> 10:46.847
WADE: By accident. Sebastian's
running a flight simulation

10:46.880 --> 10:48.381
to test my theory.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.050
I feel the need,

10:50.083 --> 10:52.953
the need for speed.
Ow!

10:52.986 --> 10:56.957
Yeah, sorry, Wordy Nerdy,
not feeling the Maverick vibe.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.158
More of a Goose,
aren't I?
Yeah.

10:58.191 --> 11:01.128
P-dawg! Missed
you last night

11:01.161 --> 11:02.963
with the boys.
Yo, what the hell?

11:02.996 --> 11:05.866
String Bean hung out
with Patton and Lasalle?

11:05.899 --> 11:08.235
Hells, yeah. Guys night.
It's a bonding ritual.

11:08.268 --> 11:09.937
Goes back to the
Middle Paleolithic era

11:09.970 --> 11:11.872
when male hunters would gather
to celebrate abundance.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.841
Anyway,
should have been there, man.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.776
It was... pretty crazy.

11:15.809 --> 11:18.245
What was it, buddy?
Uh, two Sea Breezes?

11:18.278 --> 11:19.713
And a Tom Collins.

11:19.747 --> 11:21.148
Shake off that hangover, dear,

11:21.181 --> 11:22.249
so you can tell us
about your simulation.

11:22.282 --> 11:23.784
Right. Okay, so, uh...

11:25.352 --> 11:28.255
Heads-up display from the
cockpit of the Skystormer.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.123
I ran my simulation
program on the last

11:30.157 --> 11:32.159
30 seconds of Lieutenant
Garrett's air show flight.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.494
When the ACLS function
was triggered?
Exactly.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.831
So, at the point of initiation,
Garrett was pulling four g's.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.733
But as the plane fell
into a rapid descent

11:39.767 --> 11:42.435
and increased in speed,
it elevated up to six. Now,

11:42.469 --> 11:45.172
watch what happens
at five seconds to impact.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.740
Dials level off.

11:46.774 --> 11:50.911
Five, four, three, two...

11:50.944 --> 11:52.980
Plane's down,
and as you can see,

11:53.013 --> 11:54.948
she still only maxed out
at six g's.

11:54.982 --> 11:57.450
Well, how many g's does it take
to suffer from G

11:57.484 --> 11:59.252
Pilot of Garrett's experience?

11:59.286 --> 12:00.520
Minimum eight.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.522
So, no G

12:02.555 --> 12:04.257
No. All signs still point

12:04.291 --> 12:06.860
to Lieutenant Garrett
voluntarily initiating the ACLS.

12:09.262 --> 12:12.532
Well, I, for one, am not ready
to accept that conclusion.

12:12.565 --> 12:16.804
At least not until I look
further into the victim's body.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.477
BRODY:
Commander Wilson, you were
Lieutenant Garrett's C.O.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.113
for the last two years?

12:26.146 --> 12:27.848
Yes. She was one of the most
prolific pilots

12:27.881 --> 12:29.282
I've seen in my career.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.819
Stress assessment and
situational awareness skills

12:31.852 --> 12:33.320
were off the charts.

12:33.353 --> 12:35.188
Pilots like that
don't go off the rails,

12:35.222 --> 12:36.990
crash their planes
intentionally.

12:37.024 --> 12:38.491
Did Garrett show
any signs of physical

12:38.525 --> 12:40.994
or mental duress
prior to the air show?

12:41.028 --> 12:42.462
Physicians cleared her
for sea flights

12:42.495 --> 12:44.464
on the Skystormer
less than three months ago.

12:44.497 --> 12:47.100
Awarded her top marks
across the board.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.870
But I wasn't actually in contact
with her on the day to day.

12:49.903 --> 12:53.040
Might be helpful for you to talk
to some of her squad mates.

12:53.073 --> 12:55.008
MAN:
Garrett was cool.

12:55.042 --> 12:57.110
She could hold her own
well enough with the guys.

12:57.144 --> 12:59.412
Gave us as good as she's got,
right, Gator?

12:59.446 --> 13:01.048
Yeah. Damn straight.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.883
Gator, huh?

13:02.916 --> 13:04.184
University of Florida.

13:04.217 --> 13:06.319
Bama. Roll Tide.

13:06.353 --> 13:08.922
You guys were close
with Garrett?
Training partners

13:08.956 --> 13:11.191
on the Skystormer
test flights.

13:11.224 --> 13:14.361
Yeah, Gator here
was her understudy.

13:14.394 --> 13:15.896
LC was in first position.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.297
I was her number two.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.132
LC?
Garrett's
call sign.

13:19.166 --> 13:22.970
Lucky Charm on account
of her, uh... charmed career.

13:23.003 --> 13:24.371
How did you guys feel
about that?

13:24.404 --> 13:25.405
Lindsay getting
all this attention?

13:25.438 --> 13:27.240
Oh, we gave her crap sometimes.

13:27.274 --> 13:30.377
You know, about being
the Navy's golden girl.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.245
End of the day,
we were real proud

13:32.279 --> 13:34.447
to call Lindsay
our squad mate and our friend.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.083
Yeah.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.384
Well, most of us were.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.352
Easy, Doog.

13:39.386 --> 13:42.289
You guys have something
to tell us?

13:44.324 --> 13:46.226
Look, fellas, we're just trying

13:46.259 --> 13:48.328
to get a feel
where's Lindsay's head was.

13:48.361 --> 13:49.629
When Garrett first got here,

13:49.662 --> 13:51.364
there were some rumors
floating around.

13:51.398 --> 13:52.465
What kind of rumors?

13:52.499 --> 13:54.067
That she, uh, didn't exactly

13:54.101 --> 13:55.368
earn her spot on the squad.

13:55.402 --> 13:56.236
Meaning?

13:56.269 --> 13:58.471
Meaning...

13:58.505 --> 14:02.309
maybe her test scores weren't
exactly up to snuff.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.244
BRODY:
Called the Naval

14:04.277 --> 14:06.513
Fighter School, put in
a request for Garrett's records.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.415
Well, I guess we'll see
if those, uh, rumors

14:08.448 --> 14:10.250
about her test scores
hold weight.

14:10.283 --> 14:13.153
You know, if Garrett was a guy,
would people be questioning her?

14:13.186 --> 14:16.256
No way. If you're pretty,
you slept your way to the top.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.091
If you're smart and ambitious,
you're a bitch.

14:18.125 --> 14:20.160
That seems pretty simple.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.363
You don't play up your gender
at work, shouldn't be a factor.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.899
Well, why wouldn't we play up
a thing that makes us unique?

14:25.933 --> 14:28.435
Yeah. I mean, guys don't have
to apologize for being guys.

14:28.468 --> 14:31.071
Yeah, especially when it comes
to guys night.

14:31.104 --> 14:34.241
Us skirts aren't good enough
to hang with the big guns.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.276
It ain't personal.
It's bro code.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.378
Yeah, well, bro
code is broken.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.480
Just another way to
keep the ladies down.

14:40.513 --> 14:43.951
If Garrett were receiving
preferential treatment,

14:43.984 --> 14:46.286
maybe she was worried
about it going public.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.922
Yeah, expose Navy's
golden girl as a fraud.

14:48.956 --> 14:50.390
Well, that'll be
a big-ass scandal.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.225
Yeah, but big enough to crash
a plane at an air show?

14:52.259 --> 14:53.593
I don't buy it.

14:53.626 --> 14:56.296
I don't buy it, either.
He twerks, he works.

14:58.598 --> 15:00.300
Follow me.

15:00.333 --> 15:03.336
So as I delved into Fly Girl's
digital footprint,

15:03.370 --> 15:07.340
her e-mails, her text messages,
her online purchases...

15:07.374 --> 15:08.976
Anything of note?

15:09.009 --> 15:11.444
Well, other than
her scented-candle fetish,

15:11.478 --> 15:13.113
her life was
humdrum.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.515
So I started looking into
Garrett's public persona,

15:15.548 --> 15:18.018
which is where I stumbled
across this charmer.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.652
Rudimentary but threatening.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.456
Translation of the Arabic--

15:23.490 --> 15:26.359
"Eye for an eye,
soul for a soul."

15:28.528 --> 15:31.231
WADE:
Hate threats?

15:31.264 --> 15:35.235
Possible retribution for the
mission Garrett flew in Syria.

15:35.268 --> 15:38.305
I got Patton
tracking the IP now.

15:38.338 --> 15:42.175
Those threats make sense
based on what I just found.

15:42.209 --> 15:45.512
I examined
Lieutenant Garrett's organs,

15:45.545 --> 15:47.414
and in addition
to scarred lung tissue,

15:47.447 --> 15:50.517
I discovered damaged neurons
and white matter

15:50.550 --> 15:54.988
in the brain, which is typically
a side effect of chemotherapy.

15:55.022 --> 15:57.224
Garrett's mother
died of cancer.

15:57.257 --> 15:59.492
But there was no sign
of it in Lindsay.

15:59.526 --> 16:02.229
What I did discover
was a potent neurotoxin

16:02.262 --> 16:04.497
in her bloodstream.

16:04.531 --> 16:05.732
You know what kind?

16:05.765 --> 16:07.400
Well, we're running
tests now, but

16:07.434 --> 16:08.601
that toxin was strong enough

16:08.635 --> 16:10.470
to completely shut down

16:10.503 --> 16:12.139
Garrett's
central nervous system.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.706
Symptoms?
Well, it's similar
to G-LOC.

16:13.740 --> 16:17.244
Blurry vision, loss of muscle
control, impaired judgment.

16:17.277 --> 16:20.480
All reasons Garrett could
have made an honest mistake.

16:20.513 --> 16:23.483
Well, how did a neurotoxin
like that get into her system?

16:23.516 --> 16:25.652
Not naturally.

16:25.685 --> 16:28.755
My theory-- she
was poisoned.

16:28.788 --> 16:32.725
Which means this plane crash...

16:32.759 --> 16:35.462
Just became a murder
investigation.

16:47.074 --> 16:49.142
Poisoned?

16:49.176 --> 16:51.311
M.E. found a
potent neurotoxin

16:51.344 --> 16:53.213
in Lieutenant
Garrett's system.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.715
Symptoms can range
from impaired vision,

16:55.748 --> 16:57.450
loss of muscle control,

16:57.484 --> 16:59.286
confusion.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.654
Which would affect Garrett's
performance in the cockpit.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.823
Running tests now
to figure out what the toxin is.

17:03.856 --> 17:07.227
Meantime, we're shifting our
focus to identifying suspects.

17:07.260 --> 17:10.797
Figure out who had motive
and access to Garrett.

17:10.830 --> 17:11.664
Thanks. Any leads?

17:11.698 --> 17:14.601
Online threat,
tensions within her squad.

17:14.634 --> 17:17.537
Garrett flies over 30
combat missions overseas.

17:17.570 --> 17:20.840
Killed in an air show back home.

17:20.873 --> 17:24.844
Regardless, if
Lieutenant Garrett was poisoned,

17:24.877 --> 17:26.746
it clears the plane, correct?

17:26.779 --> 17:30.817
Not comfortable going on record
one way or another.

17:30.850 --> 17:33.086
At least not until
we have all the facts at hand.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.621
Well, what's your time frame
on that?

17:34.654 --> 17:36.389
Long as it takes.

17:40.127 --> 17:41.628
Washington?

17:41.661 --> 17:43.396
Virginia.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.432
Oh. Your little girl.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.534
How

17:47.567 --> 17:50.437
Not so little. She's a
junior in high school.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.205
Driver's permit?

17:52.239 --> 17:53.840
Two weeks ago.

17:53.873 --> 17:55.875
Tempted to put
security detail on her.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.478
Well, may give you
peace of mind now.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.713
Cost you an arm and
a leg in therapy later.

18:00.747 --> 18:04.884
It's all just terrifying,
isn't it?

18:04.917 --> 18:08.121
Imagine putting her in the
cockpit of a fighter jet.

18:08.155 --> 18:12.559
Look, Dwayne, I know how
important your work is to you.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.395
It's one of the qualities
I admire most.

18:15.428 --> 18:18.898
But I have people in Washington
who need answers.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.500
Madam Secretary,

18:20.533 --> 18:23.870
a young woman's legacy
is at stake here.

18:23.903 --> 18:25.738
Believe me, I know.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.241
So, I'm going to stall
as long as I can with the hope

18:28.275 --> 18:30.310
you find who killed this girl.

18:30.343 --> 18:32.845
PATTON:
From the first moment
I saw it, this video

18:32.879 --> 18:34.647
didn't make any
sense to me.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.583
See, jihad work is
hella more sophisticated

18:36.616 --> 18:37.850
than this Looney
Tune crap.

18:37.884 --> 18:40.887
And sure enough,

18:40.920 --> 18:42.422
when I delved into the software,

18:42.455 --> 18:44.191
I found out
that it was homegrown,

18:44.224 --> 18:46.426
made right here
in the U.S. of A.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.329
Specifically,
Flash 6, C++ vector.

18:49.362 --> 18:51.331
That good or bad?
Neither.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.400
Any starving
Pixar wannabe

18:53.433 --> 18:55.768
worth their weight
can pirate a copy.

18:55.802 --> 18:59.506
But this particular version was
licensed and legit by this cat.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.908
Kellan Falk.
PRIDE:
We know who he is?

19:01.941 --> 19:04.177
Director
of Lindsay's documentary.

19:04.211 --> 19:07.347
Now he'd have access to
Lieutenant Garrett, but motive?

19:07.380 --> 19:09.616
Let's find out.

19:11.951 --> 19:15.955
It wasn't meant to be
a literal interpretation.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.258
It's hard to interpret
"eye for an eye" any other way.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.227
You're a smart
guy, Kellan.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.629
You should know that your videos
amount to a terrorist threat.

19:22.662 --> 19:23.796
Made with your software.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.865
Which may have led to a murder.

19:25.898 --> 19:28.835
When's the last time
you saw Lindsay?
Uh...

19:28.868 --> 19:30.537
Couple weeks ago, we did

19:30.570 --> 19:31.938
an interview for the
documentary's DVD extras.

19:31.971 --> 19:33.506
Excuse me.

19:33.540 --> 19:34.941
You've done what? Two movies

19:34.974 --> 19:36.309
since your documentary
with Lindsay?

19:36.343 --> 19:38.611
Three if you count my short.

19:38.645 --> 19:40.813
You've still got
her pictures up?

19:40.847 --> 19:42.215
The film was my baby.

19:42.249 --> 19:44.551
It holds a very special place
in my heart.

19:44.584 --> 19:45.985
What about Lindsay?

19:46.018 --> 19:48.888
Does she hold a special
place in your heart, too?

19:48.921 --> 19:52.759
Look, filming with Lindsay
was very intense.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.395
We got close.

19:55.428 --> 19:57.730
How close?
Were you romantically involved?

19:57.764 --> 20:00.900
Lindsay wasn't interested
in going there.

20:00.933 --> 20:05.004
She said the demands of her job
made a relationship impossible.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.974
Sounds like she just
wasn't that into you.

20:08.007 --> 20:11.010
So you figured if you scared her
from going back into the field,

20:11.043 --> 20:12.579
maybe she'd change her mind?

20:12.612 --> 20:14.247
And when that
didn't work...
Wait.

20:14.281 --> 20:15.815
I would never have hurt Lindsay.

20:15.848 --> 20:18.285
I wanted
to take care of her.

20:18.318 --> 20:19.586
I wanted to protect her.

20:19.619 --> 20:22.255
From what Al

20:22.289 --> 20:24.324
And some threats closer to home.

20:24.357 --> 20:27.994
There's some footage from the
documentary you need to see.

20:28.027 --> 20:29.896
Job's tough enough as it is.

20:29.929 --> 20:32.765
Feels like you're carrying
the weight of the world.

20:32.799 --> 20:35.268
I mean, add in being the...

20:35.302 --> 20:37.737
only female
in a sea of sharks...

20:41.007 --> 20:43.743
...burden gets
that much heavier.

20:45.612 --> 20:46.979
Let's stop.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.781
There on the wrist.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.483
Zoom in, please.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.288
It's Shay.

20:55.322 --> 20:57.424
She's pissed I'm never around.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.359
Okay, that's not
my concern at the moment,

20:59.392 --> 21:00.827
nor should it be yours.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.695
Why you got
to be so hard?

21:02.729 --> 21:04.997
I am not being hard,
but I do have expectations.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.534
Well, maybe your
expectations are too high.

21:07.567 --> 21:10.370
Look, I don't think so,
and neither should you.

21:10.403 --> 21:13.340
I'm not you. Okay, I'm not
some rock star in the lab.

21:13.373 --> 21:14.974
I'm never gonna be.

21:15.007 --> 21:17.009
And if that's not good enough,
then I'm out of here.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.611
Danny.
Back off.

21:18.645 --> 21:20.947
Just leave me alone.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.015
Danny.

21:23.049 --> 21:24.451
Everything all right?

21:24.484 --> 21:26.519
Yeah.
I, uh...

21:26.553 --> 21:28.321
I found the welt
on the wrist

21:28.355 --> 21:29.956
the documentarian
was talking about.

21:29.989 --> 21:34.093
It's at time code
a minute, 27.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.895
SEBASTIAN:
Oh, yeah, there it is.

21:35.928 --> 21:37.697
Well, based on the size
and the scope, I'd bet money

21:37.730 --> 21:39.366
this mark's a
defensive wound.

21:39.399 --> 21:41.568
By the depth of color, I'd say
it's about three days old.

21:41.601 --> 21:43.002
Somebody assaulted
Garrett.

21:43.035 --> 21:44.571
Hang on. What is that?

21:44.604 --> 21:46.072
This bruise seems

21:46.105 --> 21:48.074
to have a slightly raised
pattern injury.

21:48.107 --> 21:50.076
Usually it indicates that the
attacker was wielding something

21:50.109 --> 21:52.111
that left an impression
in the victim's skin.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.746
Can you work
your magic on it?

21:53.780 --> 21:55.348
Magic? Yeah,
I like the sound of that.

21:55.382 --> 21:56.816
I always wanted
to be a magician as a kid,

21:56.849 --> 21:58.585
but then I figured out
how David Copperfield

21:58.618 --> 22:00.119
made the Statue of Liberty
disappear

22:00.152 --> 22:01.087
and it totaled my whole...
Abracadabra, homes.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.121
Sorry. Right.
Okay, so,

22:02.154 --> 22:03.756
add a negative filter,

22:03.790 --> 22:05.958
sharpen the edges a bit here,

22:05.992 --> 22:08.661
and give the whole thing
a high-res pixel finish.

22:08.695 --> 22:10.730
Presto.
LASALLE: I'll be damned.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.965
Is that...?
Gator Nation.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.033
Gator Nation?

22:14.066 --> 22:17.069
They gave them
their own country?

22:17.103 --> 22:20.807
You think I poisoned Garrett?
I think you don't like playing

22:20.840 --> 22:22.509
second fiddle.

22:22.542 --> 22:24.811
So you started rumors
about Lindsay's test scores.

22:24.844 --> 22:27.113
Rumors that weren't true,
because Lindsay was top gun--

22:27.146 --> 22:29.982
best in her class-- I've got
the records here to prove it.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.752
But you didn't like
being beat out by a woman.

22:32.785 --> 22:35.087
So... you slip something
to Garrett, get her to mess us

22:35.121 --> 22:36.623
at the air show,
and then suddenly

22:36.656 --> 22:39.459
the understudy
is piloting the Skystormer.

22:39.492 --> 22:42.028
I had nothing but respect
for Garrett.

22:45.565 --> 22:48.868
Bruises say otherwise.

22:55.107 --> 22:56.609
What's wrong, Val, you nervous?

22:56.643 --> 22:59.679
Your hands are shaking.
Nah, just...

22:59.712 --> 23:01.047
Look, I didn't touch her
that hard.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.015
Why the hell were you
touching her at all?

23:03.049 --> 23:04.417
Past couple weeks...

23:04.451 --> 23:07.620
L.C. was acting... weird.

23:07.654 --> 23:09.589
Cranky, tired...

23:09.622 --> 23:11.190
just figured
she was burnt out.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.893
But then,
she started disappearing.

23:13.926 --> 23:16.463
Disappearing?
Couple days at a time.

23:16.496 --> 23:17.697
I got worried.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.198
Went to talk to her.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.167
When I asked her what's up...

23:21.200 --> 23:23.470
she started freaking out.

23:23.503 --> 23:26.038
Saying that I was questioning
her abilities.

23:26.072 --> 23:28.140
Kind of sounds like you were.
I told you,

23:28.174 --> 23:31.177
I was just looking out for her.

23:31.210 --> 23:32.779
Things got heated.

23:32.812 --> 23:35.548
We were angry, yelling.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.950
At one point,
Lindsay came at me,

23:37.984 --> 23:39.452
took a swing.

23:39.486 --> 23:41.153
So I grabbed her wrist
to stop her.

23:41.187 --> 23:42.922
Lindsay came at you?

23:42.955 --> 23:46.459
I'm telling you the truth.
If this is the truth,

23:46.493 --> 23:48.227
then why didn't you mention this
when we stopped by the base?

23:48.260 --> 23:50.196
Because the hell if
I was gonna give you

23:50.229 --> 23:53.500
or anybody else something that
might tarnish her reputation.

23:55.635 --> 23:57.003
Ice Man melt?

23:57.036 --> 23:59.506
:
Still not copping to anything.

23:59.539 --> 24:01.741
Just finished going
through Garrett's calendar.

24:01.774 --> 24:05.478
Find anything?
Well, besides this girl
being majorly maxed out--

24:05.512 --> 24:07.614
test flights,
training, media--

24:07.647 --> 24:09.549
I also noticed these X's

24:09.582 --> 24:10.950
randomly popping up every month.

24:10.983 --> 24:13.185
So I cross-referenced
Garrett's calendar

24:13.219 --> 24:15.488
with her OMPF file--
turns out these are

24:15.522 --> 24:17.524
her vacation days.

24:17.557 --> 24:20.627
Navy personnel get 30 days
leave per year, correct?

24:20.660 --> 24:22.495
Correct. Most sailors
take them in clumps.

24:22.529 --> 24:25.532
You know, a week at the beach
here, four-day weekend there.

24:25.565 --> 24:28.000
Garrett takes two days
at a time every month.

24:28.034 --> 24:29.168
BRODY:
Possibly sneaking away

24:29.201 --> 24:31.871
to meet someone--
boyfriend, maybe?

24:31.904 --> 24:34.674
Docu-dork said Garrett
didn't have time for guys.

24:34.707 --> 24:36.543
SONJA: What she did have
was a short-term

24:36.576 --> 24:40.713
rental in Belle Rose,
under the name Elle Cee Sandra.

24:40.747 --> 24:42.549
That's a play on
Garrett's call sign.

24:42.582 --> 24:45.117
Clever.
Oh, us girls can be like that.

24:45.151 --> 24:47.119
LASALLE:
That's not gonna get you
an invite to guys' night.

24:47.153 --> 24:49.121
You two can discuss it
on your way to Belle Rose.

24:49.155 --> 24:51.057
Find out what Lindsay Garrett
was doing down there.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.091
We're on it, King.

24:52.124 --> 24:53.626
WOMAN:
Real sweet girl.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.528
Always left the place tidy,
even the bathroom.

24:55.562 --> 24:56.963
I can't tell you

24:56.996 --> 25:00.032
how many renters have
serious hygiene issues.

25:00.066 --> 25:03.703
Lieutenant Garrett ever say
why she was in town?

25:03.736 --> 25:05.705
No. She said she
liked the area.

25:05.738 --> 25:07.073
Dang keys.

25:07.106 --> 25:09.141
Ah, now, let me, uh,
help you there.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.110
Thank you, dear.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.648
We got a runner!

25:15.682 --> 25:17.283
He's going through
the back door!

25:17.316 --> 25:18.517
I'll cut him off!

25:43.142 --> 25:44.777
NCIS.

25:45.745 --> 25:47.680
Get out the damn car.

25:50.349 --> 25:52.051
Captain Garrett?

25:53.252 --> 25:54.086
Hands up.

25:55.354 --> 25:56.589
LASALLE: Get 'em
on the hood.

26:04.130 --> 26:05.197
He's clean.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.666
Not exactly.

26:21.781 --> 26:24.083
Needles, Captain?

26:24.116 --> 26:27.820
Your daughter have a history of
drug use you forgot to mention?

26:28.788 --> 26:30.757
This isn't the Lindsay I knew.

26:30.790 --> 26:33.192
Life of a fighter pilot:

26:33.225 --> 26:34.827
intense,

26:34.861 --> 26:36.062
high-pressure.

26:36.095 --> 26:38.731
You know that
better than anyone.

26:38.765 --> 26:40.700
So tell me about
the needles.

26:40.733 --> 26:42.301
I got a call yesterday.

26:42.334 --> 26:44.804
Owner of the apartment
said Lindsay was late

26:44.837 --> 26:46.205
with the rental fee.

26:46.238 --> 26:48.374
That I was the...
the emergency contact.

26:48.407 --> 26:49.776
I didn't even know

26:49.809 --> 26:51.644
she had rented
the place.

26:51.678 --> 26:53.713
So I'm just
going down there

26:53.746 --> 26:54.981
to see what's going on...

26:55.014 --> 26:57.283
Before the Navy gets wind
of anything first?

26:57.316 --> 26:58.851
What you did--

26:58.885 --> 27:00.987
impeding
a federal investigation--

27:01.020 --> 27:03.322
could get you
in a world of trouble!

27:04.356 --> 27:05.892
I know.

27:05.925 --> 27:09.161
But I saw these needles,
and I thought,

27:09.195 --> 27:11.731
so this is her legacy?

27:11.764 --> 27:14.667
Not what she's done
for this country?

27:14.701 --> 27:17.770
And all the lives
that she saved?

27:17.804 --> 27:21.007
But a...
female pilot

27:21.040 --> 27:23.275
who cracks under pressure.

27:26.045 --> 27:29.882
As an agent, I cannot
condone what you did today.

27:33.786 --> 27:36.188
But as a father...

27:39.358 --> 27:41.794
Come on.

27:41.828 --> 27:44.330
I got some coffee going.

27:47.266 --> 27:50.803
BRODY:
Delusions, paranoia,

27:50.837 --> 27:52.304
shakes...
SONJA:
All kinds of whacked-out crap

27:52.338 --> 27:53.973
people do when
they're on drugs.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.274
Any of which could
cause Garrett

27:55.307 --> 27:57.476
to mistakenly
activate the ACLS,

27:57.509 --> 27:59.946
not to mention account for
neurotoxins in her blood.

27:59.979 --> 28:02.014
Well, it's common knowledge
military pilots

28:02.048 --> 28:03.950
been using amphetamines
to combat fatigue

28:03.983 --> 28:05.284
since the Second World War.

28:05.317 --> 28:06.986
And you saw her schedule:
jam-packed.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.921
Being a fighter pilot--
intense enough as it is.

28:08.955 --> 28:11.290
Add to that being
the female face of the Navy.

28:11.323 --> 28:13.425
Well, the girl had to be
feeling the squeeze.

28:13.459 --> 28:15.027
So steroids or speed
would make sense

28:15.061 --> 28:17.997
to help keep up
with the pace.
Shot up a bad batch,

28:18.030 --> 28:19.966
could've been cut
with some kind of toxins.

28:19.999 --> 28:23.035
Ladies, needles can sometimes
have serial numbers.

28:23.069 --> 28:25.004
Shipping order
from the medical supply company

28:25.037 --> 28:27.006
where Garrett's needles
were sold.

28:27.039 --> 28:29.876
See, guys can be clever, too.

28:33.012 --> 28:34.981
Fertility clinic.

28:35.014 --> 28:37.316
It's not the sordid
drug den I was expecting.

28:37.349 --> 28:40.452
From guys' night
to hormonal chicks
trying to get knocked up.

28:40.486 --> 28:43.823
Sad turn of events
for you, Lasalle.

28:43.856 --> 28:47.293
Guys' night really
bugs you, don't it.

28:47.326 --> 28:49.762
You want to know
who led the Pelicans

28:49.796 --> 28:52.364
in assists last year?
Tyreke Evans.

28:52.398 --> 28:53.933
You want to talk
micro brews?

28:53.966 --> 28:55.935
DBA on Frenchman has
a solid 20 taps.

28:55.968 --> 28:57.970
And if the conversation
moves to supermodels...

28:58.004 --> 28:59.972
I'm a Kate Upton girl.

29:00.006 --> 29:01.974
'Cause I appreciate curves.

29:02.008 --> 29:03.542
Do you, now?

29:05.277 --> 29:07.446
You know, I would totally
ace boys' night.

29:07.479 --> 29:10.082
I'll make sure
and spread the word.

29:10.116 --> 29:12.051
How long have you
guys been trying?

29:12.084 --> 29:14.987
We don't have any kind
of carnal knowledge.
Oh. Yeah, not even close.

29:15.021 --> 29:17.023
MAN:
Agents Percy and Lasalle?

29:22.528 --> 29:23.830
Get off of me!

29:23.863 --> 29:24.964
She'd been coming to us

29:24.997 --> 29:26.332
for about three months,

29:26.365 --> 29:28.968
on the 21st and 22nd day
of her monthly cycle.

29:29.001 --> 29:31.570
"Cycle" is another
word for...
I know what a cycle means.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.572
Now, that explains
the vacation days,

29:33.605 --> 29:35.574
but everything we
learned about Garrett,

29:35.607 --> 29:38.010
she was more focused on
her career, not babies.

29:38.044 --> 29:39.812
Oh, Lindsay wasn't trying
to get pregnant,

29:39.846 --> 29:41.113
she was harvesting eggs.

29:41.147 --> 29:42.949
Unfortunately,
Lieutenant Garrett's case

29:42.982 --> 29:45.852
was complicated-- she had
an unusually low egg count

29:45.885 --> 29:47.486
for someone her age.
So the last time

29:47.519 --> 29:49.421
she was here,
we gave her a prescription

29:49.455 --> 29:51.423
for injectable
gonadotropins.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.826
Okay, now that's
out of my wheelhouse.

29:53.860 --> 29:55.027
Fertility hormones.

29:57.196 --> 29:59.331
PRATT: Fertility drugs
cause side effects.

29:59.365 --> 30:02.034
Doctor at the clinic said
they can vary:

30:02.068 --> 30:05.137
headaches, blurred vision,
fatigue...

30:05.171 --> 30:06.338
All things
which likely contributed

30:06.372 --> 30:07.606
to Lieutenant Garrett

30:07.639 --> 30:09.508
erroneously triggering
the ACLS.

30:09.541 --> 30:10.910
Possible.

30:10.943 --> 30:12.845
We're still running tests

30:12.879 --> 30:15.014
to match the hormones
and the neurotoxin found

30:15.047 --> 30:16.548
in Lieutenant Garrett's system.

30:16.582 --> 30:18.184
Feels like you're grasping here.

30:19.551 --> 30:21.220
The facts speak for themselves.

30:21.253 --> 30:22.855
The plane was clean.

30:26.058 --> 30:27.059
Madam Secretary,
if you don't mind,

30:27.093 --> 30:28.294
I'll catch up
with you

30:28.327 --> 30:29.228
in a few minutes.

30:29.261 --> 30:31.630
Sure.

30:31.663 --> 30:34.066
I understand
how it seems on the page,

30:34.100 --> 30:36.035
but the facts haven't
all lined up yet.

30:36.068 --> 30:38.004
Navy protocol states
that pilots must disclose

30:38.037 --> 30:40.940
all medication down to the
last tablet of ibuprofen,

30:40.973 --> 30:42.274
and yet, Garrett didn't.

30:42.308 --> 30:44.276
Only woman
in an all-male squadron.

30:44.310 --> 30:46.979
Not the friendliest
place to talk about babies.

30:47.013 --> 30:49.248
Right, and any reason
to question Garrett's
commitment...

30:49.281 --> 30:51.250
Believe me, I get it.

30:51.283 --> 30:53.152
But the second
I acknowledge it,

30:53.185 --> 30:55.587
I'm accused of
going soft. Hm?

30:55.621 --> 30:58.090
Bottom line is,
if Garrett was remiss

30:58.124 --> 31:01.460
in any way and caused
that crash, then the
truth has to come out.

31:01.493 --> 31:03.562
Well, and it will,

31:03.595 --> 31:06.065
soon as we have all the
necessary information.

31:06.098 --> 31:07.466
Washington's getting antsy.

31:07.499 --> 31:09.936
I need my people
to start filing a report

31:09.969 --> 31:12.271
ruling one way or the other.

31:17.109 --> 31:19.045
WADE:
Tox screen came back clean

31:19.078 --> 31:20.346
for gonadotropins.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.114
PRIDE:
So Garrett wasn't taking

31:22.148 --> 31:23.582
fertility drugs.
Apparently not.

31:23.615 --> 31:26.152
I called the pharmacy
in Belle Rose.

31:26.185 --> 31:29.021
Turns out she never filled
out the prescription;

31:29.055 --> 31:30.256
requested the pharmacy

31:30.289 --> 31:33.159
to put the prescription
on hold for a month.

31:33.192 --> 31:35.261
She pushed it
until after the air show.

31:35.294 --> 31:37.229
Garrett was doing
the right thing--

31:37.263 --> 31:40.199
making sure she was fit
to fly the Skystormer.

31:40.232 --> 31:42.334
This case makes no sense.

31:42.368 --> 31:44.236
Unknown toxin
in the blood,

31:44.270 --> 31:47.439
damaged lungs,
and still no definitive cause

31:47.473 --> 31:52.144
for Garrett to make
this kind of a mistake?

31:52.178 --> 31:54.213
Well, if it was a mistake.
You don't work

31:54.246 --> 31:56.248
as hard as Lieutenant Garrett
to get to the top,

31:56.282 --> 31:58.050
and then just throw it all away.

31:58.084 --> 31:59.285
Says the first woman to join

31:59.318 --> 32:01.287
the Louisiana Board
of Medical Examiners.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.055
Woman of color at that.

32:03.089 --> 32:04.957
It was a boys' club, no doubt.

32:04.991 --> 32:07.293
Hard to get in;
harder to stay in.

32:07.326 --> 32:09.495
So you strive to be perfect.

32:11.230 --> 32:13.599
I see you pushing Danny.

32:13.632 --> 32:16.402
I'm finding
my way, Dwayne.

32:16.435 --> 32:19.238
This parenting thing...

32:19.271 --> 32:23.175
it's a steeper hill than
any I've ever climbed before.

32:23.209 --> 32:24.977
All I can tell you is...

32:25.011 --> 32:28.280
keep putting one foot
in front of the other.

32:28.314 --> 32:31.183
In the end...
it'll be worth it.

32:32.251 --> 32:34.320
Bye.
You don't need a ride?

32:34.353 --> 32:37.156
No, I'm going
back to the morgue.

32:43.195 --> 32:46.265
Danny, why are you here
so late?

32:46.298 --> 32:49.535
Decided to fix some files
I messed up earlier, so...

32:54.740 --> 32:57.309
What did I mess up now?

32:58.177 --> 33:01.147
Nothing.

33:01.180 --> 33:04.150
Oh. Nothing at all.

33:04.183 --> 33:07.186
Look, I know

33:07.219 --> 33:09.755
how hard it is
to stand out in this world,

33:09.788 --> 33:11.723
make an impression,
be great.

33:11.757 --> 33:14.726
I want to stand out.
I do.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.728
But I'm-I'm not you.

33:16.762 --> 33:19.165
I don't have your genes.
Maybe not

33:19.198 --> 33:21.700
but you are my family.

33:23.369 --> 33:25.304
Minamata.

33:25.337 --> 33:26.372
What?

33:26.405 --> 33:28.440
Family. Genes.

33:28.474 --> 33:30.442
Look up "Minamata."

33:30.476 --> 33:32.078
Print out
everything you find.

33:32.111 --> 33:35.214
Okay.

33:35.247 --> 33:37.416
I was digging into Lindsay
Garrett's family history.

33:37.449 --> 33:39.485
Infertility issues,
specifically.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.120
What'd you find?
Nothing.

33:41.153 --> 33:43.322
Not one case of infertility
on either side.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.491
But, when with Danny,

33:45.524 --> 33:48.260
what popped into
my mind? Minamata,

33:48.294 --> 33:52.064
a small fishing hamlet in
the southern region of Japan.

33:52.098 --> 33:53.599
In the 1950s,

33:53.632 --> 33:56.435
the village was stricken
by a mysterious phenomenon.

33:56.468 --> 33:59.271
The women were plagued
with reproductive issues--

33:59.305 --> 34:02.141
problems conceiving, stillborns,
birth defects.

34:02.174 --> 34:03.375
That's terrible.

34:03.409 --> 34:05.144
Ah, but relevant.

34:05.177 --> 34:07.513
The scientists were able
to isolate the culprit,

34:07.546 --> 34:10.482
methylmercury released
in the bay.

34:10.516 --> 34:12.551
Problem:

34:12.584 --> 34:15.187
mercury doesn't show up
on toxicology screens

34:15.221 --> 34:17.189
unless specifically tested for.

34:17.223 --> 34:21.827
Now, ask me what the symptoms
of mercury poisoning are.

34:22.761 --> 34:24.230
Headaches, fatigue,

34:24.263 --> 34:26.398
severe bruising,

34:26.432 --> 34:29.635
ruptured blood vessels
in the eyes.

34:29.668 --> 34:32.638
All symptoms Lindsay
Garrett suffered from.

34:32.671 --> 34:34.473
It says here
that contact with mercury

34:34.506 --> 34:36.875
can lead to muscle spasms.
So if we are going off

34:36.908 --> 34:39.345
the idea that Garrett was
poisoned, then whoever did it

34:39.378 --> 34:41.413
could also suffer
from mercury poisoning.

34:41.447 --> 34:44.250
If they didn't handle
the toxin correctly.

34:44.283 --> 34:45.717
Franco.

34:45.751 --> 34:49.388
His hands were shaking
pretty badly the other night.

34:49.421 --> 34:52.724
Let's go.

34:52.758 --> 34:54.293
PRIDE:
Just arriving at the base.

34:54.326 --> 34:56.262
Has anyone located
Lieutenant Franco?

34:56.295 --> 34:58.464
WOMAN:
Agent Pride, we just got word
a Skystormer left the hangar.

34:58.497 --> 35:00.132
F-15s are scrambling.

35:00.166 --> 35:01.733
We're determining
the location now.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.402
PILOT:
Tower, be advised.

35:03.435 --> 35:04.503
We've identified a Skystormer

35:04.536 --> 35:06.205
on Runway 422.

35:06.238 --> 35:08.174
There.

35:42.741 --> 35:44.510
Franco...
He's out cold.

35:44.543 --> 35:46.378
We're going to need an EMT here.

35:46.412 --> 35:47.813
Franco.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.793
You still think
I'm your bad guy?

36:01.827 --> 36:03.795
You were on the runway,

36:03.829 --> 36:05.797
about to take off
in the Skystormer.

36:05.831 --> 36:07.966
That doesn't exactly
bode well for you.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.269
I told you. I would never...

36:10.302 --> 36:12.271
Never hurt Lindsay. I know.

36:12.304 --> 36:14.373
So what were you doing
in that plane?

36:14.406 --> 36:16.608
Same thing you're doing here.

36:16.642 --> 36:19.611
Trying to prove that the
accident wasn't Lindsay's fault.

36:19.645 --> 36:21.547
I figured if I flew
her air show program,

36:21.580 --> 36:23.549
maybe the answers would just...

36:23.582 --> 36:25.484
appear.
Or...

36:25.517 --> 36:27.286
the same thing
would happen to you,

36:27.319 --> 36:29.455
and we wouldn't be having
this conversation right now.

36:29.488 --> 36:31.690
Funny risk for a killer
to take, huh?

36:31.723 --> 36:32.924
PRIDE:
Okay.

36:34.426 --> 36:36.628
Don't go anywhere.

36:39.631 --> 36:40.699
PRIDE:
Thank you.

36:40.732 --> 36:41.900
Doctor says

36:41.933 --> 36:44.603
mercury levels
in Franco's bloodstream

36:44.636 --> 36:46.838
suggest three
to four months' exposure

36:46.872 --> 36:49.241
with primary damage
to the lungs.

36:49.275 --> 36:52.678
So it's likely Lieutenant
Franco inhaled the toxin.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.780
Lindsey had lung damage, too.
So if the
timeline is right,

36:54.813 --> 36:58.417
both Garrett and Franco
started accumulating mercury

36:58.450 --> 37:00.386
during
the Skystormer sea flights.

37:00.419 --> 37:01.687
Which means it has to be...

37:01.720 --> 37:02.854
The plane.

37:02.888 --> 37:04.556
Because Lieutenant Garrett
and Franco

37:04.590 --> 37:05.957
both presented
damaged lung tissue,

37:05.991 --> 37:08.260
I knew that the mercury
poisoning had to be the result

37:08.294 --> 37:09.695
of inhalation. But...

37:09.728 --> 37:11.697
when I tested the oxygen system
on the Skystormer,

37:11.730 --> 37:13.665
came up empty-handed.

37:13.699 --> 37:15.934
You know he doesn't need
to be wearing that suit, right?

37:15.967 --> 37:17.969
If there's a chance for me
to dress up like Doc Brown

37:18.003 --> 37:20.472
from Back to the Future,
I'm just... I'm gonna take it.

37:20.506 --> 37:22.608
Anyway, as I
was saying,

37:22.641 --> 37:24.610
I dug deeper into the mystery
and realized

37:24.643 --> 37:27.813
that mercury vaporizes
at 357 degrees, meaning

37:27.846 --> 37:30.048
whatever plane part leaked
the toxin into that cockpit

37:30.081 --> 37:31.650
must have gotten pretty hot

37:31.683 --> 37:33.719
to release the
poisonous...

37:33.752 --> 37:37.022
gas.

37:37.055 --> 37:38.724
Electrical components?

37:43.929 --> 37:46.632
Great Scott.

37:50.936 --> 37:53.705
This supposed to mean something?

37:53.739 --> 37:55.541
Coupling...

37:55.574 --> 37:59.411
from the Skystormer's
electrical circuitry system.

37:59.445 --> 38:03.849
Agent Pride, there are thousands
of parts that comprise that jet.

38:03.882 --> 38:07.719
Couldn't possibly know every
inconsequential piece of metal.

38:07.753 --> 38:12.290
Well, this one happens to be the
one that killed Lindsay Garrett.

38:14.092 --> 38:16.662
Looked over...

38:16.695 --> 38:19.998
your final budget
that you submitted.

38:20.031 --> 38:22.534
Revisions indicate cuts,
correct?

38:22.568 --> 38:23.769
We had to get

38:23.802 --> 38:25.937
the budget down.
This here...

38:25.971 --> 38:28.774
this is a line item
for the coupling order,

38:28.807 --> 38:31.477
isn't it?

38:31.510 --> 38:33.111
We outsourced it.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.714
To a foreign
manufacturing plant.

38:35.747 --> 38:38.684
One that didn't adhere
to U.S. military specs.

38:38.717 --> 38:41.086
I didn't know
the part would be faulty.
You didn't know

38:41.119 --> 38:42.854
it'd be safe either.

38:44.423 --> 38:46.492
By taking that risk,

38:46.525 --> 38:49.728
it cost an American hero
her life.

39:07.012 --> 39:11.850
* I was burned out and lost

39:14.853 --> 39:17.889
* A dusty bulb,
an abandoned lot *

39:20.091 --> 39:22.694
* And the nighttime was

39:22.728 --> 39:26.064
* The worst

39:26.097 --> 39:29.935
* It shows you all the things
you lost... *

39:32.103 --> 39:33.772
Captain...

39:33.805 --> 39:36.442
please accept
my condolences.

39:36.475 --> 39:38.810
I appreciate that.

39:38.844 --> 39:40.879
Don't know if this will give you
any comfort,

39:40.912 --> 39:44.816
but I've read
the NSC black box report.

39:44.850 --> 39:46.151
Right before
she passed out,

39:46.184 --> 39:49.555
your daughter
did trigger the ACLS,

39:49.588 --> 39:51.623
but for good reason.

39:51.657 --> 39:55.994
Purposely avoided
a grandstand

39:56.027 --> 39:58.163
packed with spectators.

39:58.196 --> 40:00.699
Her last act,

40:00.732 --> 40:02.901
saving hundreds of lives.

40:02.934 --> 40:04.870
* Until you lose it all...

40:06.972 --> 40:08.974
Thank you.

40:14.980 --> 40:16.648
Agent Brody.

40:16.682 --> 40:19.217
Lieutenant Franco. You look
like you're feeling better.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.886
Thanks to your team.

40:20.919 --> 40:23.121
We're just
doing our job.

40:23.154 --> 40:26.758
Still, was hoping
I could thank you

40:26.792 --> 40:29.427
by maybe taking you out
sometime.

40:30.929 --> 40:34.666
Are you hitting on me at
a funeral, Lieutenant?

40:34.700 --> 40:36.668
Yeah, well,

40:36.702 --> 40:40.105
recently came to my attention
that life can be short.

40:40.138 --> 40:41.973
So what do you think?

40:42.007 --> 40:45.577
I think your
timing is terrible.

40:47.879 --> 40:49.781
Call me tomorrow.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.484
Try then.

40:52.518 --> 40:54.019
Got to warn you,

40:54.052 --> 40:57.055
my idea of a first date starts
at 15,000 feet up.

41:03.862 --> 41:06.231
* I was burned out
and lost... *

41:06.264 --> 41:08.233
Advance copy of my
report to Washington,

41:08.266 --> 41:10.702
citing mechanical failure
as the cause of the crash.

41:10.736 --> 41:12.904
I thought you should be
the first one to see it.

41:12.938 --> 41:15.541
Wow.

41:15.574 --> 41:18.243
Halting production
on that jet.

41:18.276 --> 41:20.879
Imagine you're gonna catch hell
back in DC.

41:20.912 --> 41:23.248
Had to be done.
And I'm glad we figured it out

41:23.281 --> 41:24.883
before anybody else got hurt.

41:24.916 --> 41:26.852
Can thank you and your team
for that.

41:26.885 --> 41:29.054
Appreciate you hanging in
with us.

41:31.322 --> 41:32.924
Back to Washington?

41:32.958 --> 41:34.993
Virginia. That kid's
gonna do me in.

41:35.026 --> 41:36.828
Enjoy her while you can.

41:36.862 --> 41:39.097
I fully intend to.

41:39.130 --> 41:40.131
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

41:40.165 --> 41:41.933
Girls' night tomorrow, B.?

41:41.967 --> 41:43.935
Kermit Ruffins is playing
at the Rock 'n' Bowl.

41:43.969 --> 41:48.039
Would love to, but Lieutenant
Franco kind of asked me out.

41:48.073 --> 41:48.974
What?!

41:49.007 --> 41:50.241
To go flying. I mean,

41:50.275 --> 41:51.943
I could reschedule, but...

41:51.977 --> 41:55.080
Girl, please. Fine pilot.
Mile High Club.

41:55.113 --> 41:57.949
I wouldn't let you miss that
for the world.

41:57.983 --> 42:00.986
You know, that is what girl code
is really about.

42:01.019 --> 42:04.189
Uh-oh. Sounds like some serious
female bonding going on.

42:04.222 --> 42:07.993
Well, you know, the difference
is we're open to all kinds--

42:08.026 --> 42:10.862
guys, girls, hell,
even freaks like you, Lasalle.

42:13.899 --> 42:14.966
Gator Nation.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.868
Ow! Dang.

42:16.902 --> 42:18.870
All right, Percy,

42:18.904 --> 42:21.172
all-time leading
Saints rusher.

42:21.206 --> 42:23.609
Deuce. 6,096 yards.

42:25.043 --> 42:27.012
Ginger or Mary Ann?

42:27.045 --> 42:28.814
Oh, I'd love to say Mary Ann,

42:28.847 --> 42:30.916
but, come on, Ginger.

42:30.949 --> 42:32.751
Typical.

42:32.784 --> 42:34.352
All right, look,

42:34.385 --> 42:36.822
next time the guys go out,
you're in.

42:36.855 --> 42:38.957
Nah.

42:38.990 --> 42:40.959
Nah, I think I'll pass.

42:40.992 --> 42:43.061
What do you mean?

42:43.094 --> 42:46.665
Yeah, I didn't actually want to
hang out with you Neanderthals.

42:46.698 --> 42:49.300
I just wanted to be asked.

42:50.702 --> 42:52.604
Where did Deuce
go to college?

42:52.638 --> 42:53.972
Ole Miss.

42:54.005 --> 42:55.907
He gave Alabama all
kind of headaches.

42:55.941 --> 42:58.109
Oh. Nothin' like
them elephant tears.
