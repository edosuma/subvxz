00:00.460 --> 00:01.954
<i>Previously on The Fosters...</i>

00:01.955 --> 00:04.353
I don't want to do it.
I mean, I wanna do it,

00:04.361 --> 00:05.294
but not like this.

00:05.329 --> 00:06.696
It's our first time,

00:06.730 --> 00:09.532
and we gotta get on the road.
We got a midnight show in L.A.

00:09.566 --> 00:11.701
You want a beer?

00:11.735 --> 00:14.404
Mariana: <i>I had sex for the
first time, with Wyatt.</i>

00:14.438 --> 00:15.872
- Cheers.
- Brandon.

00:15.906 --> 00:18.074
Let's do Tequila shots.

00:18.108 --> 00:19.108
(Cell phone vibrating)

00:19.143 --> 00:20.510
- What happened, Brandon?
- I overslept.

00:20.544 --> 00:21.944
Did you rewrite your fugue?

00:21.979 --> 00:23.746
No, I didn't get a chance to finish it.

00:23.781 --> 00:25.314
What were you doing all night?

00:25.349 --> 00:28.618
<i>My name's Cole. I'm 15.
I'm a transgender. Male.</i>

00:28.652 --> 00:29.952
- Sorry.
- Get out!

00:29.987 --> 00:31.120
This center's for foster kids.

00:31.155 --> 00:32.155
I am a foster kid.

00:32.189 --> 00:33.956
- Do you really trust him?
- Why do you ask?

00:33.991 --> 00:34.860
You know the reason he's here, right?

00:35.026 --> 00:36.926
What's up with that Tony
Gwynn ball in your room?

00:36.961 --> 00:39.462
Brandon: That was actually a gift.

00:39.497 --> 00:40.497
What the hell are you doing?

00:47.145 --> 00:48.545
What's going on?

00:48.580 --> 00:49.713
You want to tell her or should I?

00:49.747 --> 00:51.014
Look, this isn't what you think it is.

00:51.049 --> 00:52.616
Just say it, you were
going to steal the ball.

00:52.650 --> 00:53.650
No, man. That's not...

00:53.685 --> 00:55.886
- Really? You're going to deny it?
- Brandon, let him talk.

00:57.222 --> 00:58.222
I was putting it back.

00:58.256 --> 00:59.456
I told you we couldn't trust him.

00:59.491 --> 01:01.358
I'm not going to let
my dad get screwed over.

01:01.392 --> 01:04.161
Brandon, hold on. Um,
A.J., will you just...

01:10.709 --> 01:12.743
Okay, you need to chill, please?

01:12.778 --> 01:13.878
You're going to defend him?

01:13.912 --> 01:15.913
He took off today, Brandon, he's scared.

01:15.948 --> 01:17.982
Oh, okay. So that's what
people do when they're scared?

01:18.016 --> 01:19.984
They steal? Really? What happens
when he gets scared again?

01:21.086 --> 01:22.587
Do you remember when I first came here?

01:22.621 --> 01:24.155
I would've done anything to get to Jude.

01:24.189 --> 01:25.823
- You didn't steal.
- I would have.

01:27.993 --> 01:31.362
I didn't trust anyone until
you showed me that I could.

01:31.396 --> 01:33.331
Your dad did that with A.J. today.

01:34.366 --> 01:37.435
Can you please just let this
go? If not for A.J., for me.

01:43.175 --> 01:44.175
(Knock on door)

01:45.944 --> 01:47.244
Brandon's cool...

01:47.279 --> 01:48.512
for now.

01:48.547 --> 01:50.181
But if you so much as breathe
funny, you're on your own.

02:16.676 --> 02:17.676
How's your mom?

02:18.712 --> 02:20.212
They're coming for a visit.

02:21.103 --> 02:22.370
Huh! When?

02:22.404 --> 02:23.404
Tomorrow.

02:24.190 --> 02:25.924
Apparently, Nate's in town on business,

02:25.958 --> 02:28.793
and Mom and Dad want us
all to have dinner together.

02:28.828 --> 02:30.862
(Chuckles) Really?

02:33.165 --> 02:34.599
How do you feel about that?

02:36.002 --> 02:38.937
Well, I guess I'm... fine.

02:38.971 --> 02:40.839
I kinda have to be, right?

02:40.873 --> 02:42.874
But do you mind if we
have them here, though?

02:42.908 --> 02:44.218
I don't want to go to some restaurant where

02:44.219 --> 02:46.130
we won't be able to really talk, you know?

02:46.155 --> 02:48.823
Do you really want to talk?

02:48.858 --> 02:50.025
With all the kids here?

02:50.059 --> 02:51.326
No, it'll be Saturday night,

02:51.360 --> 02:52.694
all the kids will be out,

02:52.728 --> 02:54.663
and honestly,

02:56.599 --> 02:59.034
it's time to clear the air, right?

02:59.068 --> 03:00.936
I mean, he and my mom worked it out,

03:02.004 --> 03:04.773
and if she can forgive him for
calling her that hateful word,

03:07.743 --> 03:09.144
I guess I can, too.

So, you drove all the
way from San Francisco?

03:55.358 --> 03:58.193
- Isn't that like...
- Nine hours? Yeah.

03:59.229 --> 04:00.929
But it was worth it. Look...

04:02.232 --> 04:04.266
the whole trip all I've
been thinking about is...

04:05.368 --> 04:06.501
How we left things.

04:06.536 --> 04:08.804
But I kinda feel like

04:08.838 --> 04:10.439
I left you with the wrong impression.

04:12.242 --> 04:13.342
I love you.

04:14.611 --> 04:16.712
And I really want to have sex with you.

04:18.714 --> 04:21.116
I mean, if you still want to?

04:23.620 --> 04:24.653
Okay, good.

04:25.989 --> 04:28.891
But, I mean, not tonight, right?

04:29.893 --> 04:31.426
I mean, we can't, my moms are home.

04:31.461 --> 04:33.295
No, of course.

04:34.397 --> 04:37.199
But, maybe before I go back on the road?

04:54.317 --> 04:55.617
What?

04:55.652 --> 04:57.185
Oh, that's how it's gonna be?

04:58.321 --> 04:59.321
Are you serious?

04:59.355 --> 05:01.290
You started it.

05:03.393 --> 05:05.260
How long are we gonna stay here for?

05:05.295 --> 05:09.031
Um, I kinda promised Callie
that I'd spend the day with her.

05:09.065 --> 05:11.366
I don't want to be the
kind of girl that, you know,

05:11.401 --> 05:13.602
drops everything and cancels on everyone

05:13.636 --> 05:15.737
just to spend time with
her boyfriend. Okay?

05:17.173 --> 05:19.174
Okay... yeah, sure.

05:19.208 --> 05:22.210
So tell me about the tour. How is it?

05:23.413 --> 05:25.414
It's pretty boring, really.

05:25.448 --> 05:27.282
Mostly just driving around in the van,

05:27.317 --> 05:28.850
eating gas station hot dogs,

05:28.885 --> 05:30.752
and Never Have I Ever.

05:30.787 --> 05:34.022
For the record, Jasper's tried
some pretty messed up stuff.

05:35.158 --> 05:38.694
Yeah, like you're not mobbed
by groupies after every show.

05:40.663 --> 05:41.730
You got me.

05:42.966 --> 05:44.366
Check this one out.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.768
She's a little nuts, but a total brainiac.

05:46.803 --> 05:48.837
And, dare I say it, super hot.

05:54.844 --> 05:57.512
You photoshopped me into
all of your tour pictures?

05:57.547 --> 05:59.414
See? I only have eyes for one groupie.

06:01.918 --> 06:02.985
Cole!

06:03.019 --> 06:04.419
Hey, stranger.

06:04.454 --> 06:06.655
- Hi!
- It's so good to see you.

06:06.689 --> 06:07.923
Wait, your voice.

06:07.957 --> 06:08.991
Yeah.

06:09.025 --> 06:10.258
(Laughs)

06:10.293 --> 06:12.794
- Guys, this is Cole.
- Hey!

06:17.767 --> 06:18.767
(Knock on door)

06:18.801 --> 06:20.369
Hey, any musical geniuses here?

06:20.403 --> 06:22.404
Hey, Grampa!

06:22.438 --> 06:25.173
Hey, Brandon, how are you?

06:25.208 --> 06:26.375
Good.

06:27.377 --> 06:31.646
Good. How's that fancy
summer music camp coming?

06:31.681 --> 06:34.549
Uh, not so great, at the moment.

06:34.584 --> 06:36.518
Really? Why? What's the matter?

06:36.552 --> 06:38.587
Ugh! Where do I start?

06:39.856 --> 06:44.426
Let's just say I have a mid-term
presentation for the dean tonight

06:44.460 --> 06:45.527
and nothing to play.

06:45.561 --> 06:47.763
They've got a dean at a camp?

06:47.797 --> 06:49.064
Must be serious, huh?

06:49.098 --> 06:50.599
You think?

06:52.502 --> 06:54.469
And it's not even the dean
that's stressing me out.

06:54.504 --> 06:56.138
It's my stupid partner.

06:57.540 --> 07:00.342
It's like, no matter what
I do, she dumps all over it.

07:00.376 --> 07:01.927
Yeah? Well, you better get to work

07:01.928 --> 07:04.420
and just compose something
so undeniably brilliant

07:04.814 --> 07:06.281
that it'll shut her up for good.

07:07.316 --> 07:08.917
Easier said than done.

07:09.886 --> 07:13.155
Oh, hey! Sorry that I can't
be here for dinner with Nate.

07:13.189 --> 07:15.223
Oh, that's okay. We'll
have a good brunch tomorrow.

07:16.259 --> 07:20.295
- Grandpa, can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

07:21.764 --> 07:24.866
What happened? With Nate, I mean.

07:24.901 --> 07:26.335
Mama never talks about him.

07:26.569 --> 07:29.827
How do I put this? When I remarried Dana,

07:30.340 --> 07:32.842
Nate felt abandoned.

07:32.876 --> 07:34.944
He was angry.

07:34.978 --> 07:37.380
He was very, very angry.

07:37.414 --> 07:40.916
For good reason. I should've
never let his mother have custody,

07:40.951 --> 07:42.184
but back in those days...

07:43.553 --> 07:45.721
Anyway, I got him out

07:45.756 --> 07:47.690
to come spend the summer with us,

07:47.724 --> 07:49.325
and he was so...

07:49.359 --> 07:53.562
surly nasty that ultimately
he ended up going home early.

07:53.597 --> 07:56.932
And after that, it was easy
for him to just cut us off.

07:56.967 --> 08:00.536
I reached out to him
over the years, and then

08:00.570 --> 08:02.672
finally last year, he reached back.

08:04.575 --> 08:06.676
Anyway, I'm talking your
ear off, you got work to do.

08:06.711 --> 08:09.379
Just tell me one thing,
where is the working bathroom?

08:09.413 --> 08:10.980
I got a bladder that's about to burst.

08:11.015 --> 08:13.249
- Just there.
- Oh, thanks. See you soon.

08:14.351 --> 08:17.754
What is all this? Dana, it looks like
you brought the whole market with you.

08:17.788 --> 08:21.891
Don't be silly. You're so lovely
to host with such short notice.

08:21.926 --> 08:23.626
We just picked up a few things.

08:23.661 --> 08:27.297
Enough for a nice
charcuterie plate... or two.

08:28.299 --> 08:29.632
Where's Daddy?

08:29.667 --> 08:30.967
He needs to get his prostate checked.

08:31.001 --> 08:33.001
I swear the man pees every 15 seconds.

08:36.107 --> 08:38.850
Oh, I hope you don't mind, but Nate called.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.644
He's bringing his girlfriend to dinner.

08:44.415 --> 08:46.450
His girlfriend?

08:46.484 --> 08:48.986
Do you really think
that's appropriate? I mean,

08:49.020 --> 08:50.787
if I would've known he wasn't coming alone,

08:50.822 --> 08:52.956
I might have preferred we
do this at a restaurant.

08:52.991 --> 08:54.658
Oh, it'll be fine, honey.

08:54.692 --> 08:57.194
Sure, it'll be fine, but how are we
supposed to have a real conversation

08:57.228 --> 08:58.762
with his girlfriend here?

08:58.796 --> 09:00.831
A conversation about what?

09:00.865 --> 09:03.000
We haven't seen each
other in 20 years, Mom.

09:03.034 --> 09:04.468
You don't think we need to talk about why?

09:04.502 --> 09:07.237
No, I don't. It'll just upset your father.

09:08.773 --> 09:10.374
Wait a second.

09:10.509 --> 09:14.145
Dad still doesn't know about
this? About what Nate called you?

09:15.447 --> 09:16.447
No, he doesn't.

09:16.481 --> 09:18.115
And I'd like to keep it that way.

09:19.785 --> 09:22.253
When Nate reached out to you before
Christmas, what did he say to you?

09:23.322 --> 09:24.856
He apologized, right?

09:24.890 --> 09:26.290
No. No, he didn't.

09:26.325 --> 09:27.558
We didn't talk about it.

09:27.593 --> 09:29.427
Lena, please, can we just...

09:29.461 --> 09:31.095
Can we just, what? Pretend
like it never happened?

09:32.097 --> 09:33.764
He said horrible things to you.

09:33.799 --> 09:37.235
How can you even consider having a
relationship with him without talking about it?

09:37.269 --> 09:39.971
Because I just want to keep
the past where it belongs,

09:40.005 --> 09:43.174
and have a lovely family reunion.

09:43.208 --> 09:47.078
I see no reason to punish a grown
man for, what, he said 20 years ago.

09:47.112 --> 09:49.633
I got over it. It's time
you got over it, Lena.

09:49.641 --> 09:51.075
Where's my baby?

09:51.109 --> 09:52.877
- Hi, Daddy...
- Hey!

09:54.376 --> 09:55.877
Hey, Stef.

09:55.911 --> 09:57.979
- Stewart, so good to see you.
- You, too.

09:58.013 --> 10:00.648
Oh, I got something for my girl.

10:00.683 --> 10:02.217
Uh-huh.

10:02.251 --> 10:03.892
- A-ha!
- Oh, Daddy.

10:04.187 --> 10:05.587
I haven't had any of this in ages.

10:05.621 --> 10:06.888
I can never find it around here.

10:06.923 --> 10:08.690
I ordered it special.

10:08.724 --> 10:10.492
Thank you. Always thinkin' of me.

10:10.526 --> 10:11.726
No, thank you.

10:11.761 --> 10:14.362
Thank you for agreeing to this dinner.

10:14.397 --> 10:16.865
I'm very grateful to have
us all together finally.

10:20.803 --> 10:22.904
And a lot of queer kids
don't even go to prom.

10:22.939 --> 10:26.041
I mean, when your school can
stop a boy from wearing a dress,

10:26.075 --> 10:27.876
or two girls from going as dates,

10:27.910 --> 10:28.880
what's the point?

10:29.085 --> 10:32.254
So, I figured we should put
together a night that's just ours.

10:32.289 --> 10:33.556
A night where we can just...

10:34.958 --> 10:36.225
Be, you know.

10:36.259 --> 10:37.860
Sounds cool.

10:37.894 --> 10:41.263
You should come, it'll give you and Jude
a chance to meet other gay kids your age.

10:43.500 --> 10:44.767
Who are you taking?

10:44.801 --> 10:46.635
I am goin' stag.

10:46.670 --> 10:50.406
No! You cannot go to your own prom alone.

10:50.440 --> 10:52.041
There has to be someone you can ask.

10:52.075 --> 10:53.542
- Like who?
- Like me.

10:55.345 --> 10:56.579
Seriously? You don't have plans?

10:56.613 --> 10:58.714
I was just gonna go to the
movies with Jude and Connor,

10:58.748 --> 11:00.583
but no, we'll all come.

11:01.585 --> 11:02.751
We will?

11:02.786 --> 11:04.086
Yeah. It'll be fun.

11:04.120 --> 11:05.621
For real? Are you sure?

11:05.655 --> 11:06.889
Yeah, if you'll have me.

11:08.391 --> 11:11.327
All right, sweet. It's a date.

11:12.562 --> 11:14.964
I'm gonna go hit the water, cool off.

11:14.998 --> 11:16.098
Mmm-hmm.

11:16.132 --> 11:17.132
Rematch.

11:28.906 --> 11:30.240
So, what happened to him?

11:30.274 --> 11:32.208
He's transgender.

11:32.243 --> 11:33.276
Was born in the wrong body.

11:34.545 --> 11:35.745
So those scars...

11:36.814 --> 11:37.981
he did that on purpose?

11:38.015 --> 11:39.249
Yeah, and...

11:40.318 --> 11:41.551
Whoa.

11:41.585 --> 11:43.987
Okay, when I first met Cole,

11:44.021 --> 11:46.356
he was literally binding his chest.

11:46.390 --> 11:48.124
And look how proud he is now.

11:48.159 --> 11:49.659
Taking off his shirt like that.

11:49.694 --> 11:52.362
He's in a good place finally,

11:52.396 --> 11:54.130
so don't go making him feel weird about it.

11:55.066 --> 11:57.200
Damn. I was just asking.

11:58.336 --> 11:59.937
Remind me not to mess with you.

12:02.273 --> 12:04.308
I'm going in.

12:04.342 --> 12:05.842
Those sharks better watch out.

12:18.443 --> 12:20.800
_

12:54.501 --> 12:56.448
_

12:59.798 --> 13:00.798
I know what you're gonna say.

13:00.899 --> 13:03.067
"Hate the word and not the hater."

13:03.102 --> 13:05.336
I just don't believe that someone
could say something so racist

13:05.371 --> 13:07.605
and not be one, especially that word.

13:07.640 --> 13:08.640
I hear you, love.

13:08.674 --> 13:10.508
I get that Nate was 17, and he was angry

13:10.542 --> 13:12.176
he didn't get to live with his dad.

13:12.211 --> 13:15.113
I'm even willing to believe that
he doesn't feel that way now,

13:15.147 --> 13:18.850
and he would never say anything
so ignorant and hateful right now,

13:18.884 --> 13:20.518
but he said it then.

13:20.552 --> 13:22.720
And I just can't
understand how he could try

13:22.755 --> 13:24.622
to reconcile with my
mom without apologizing.

13:26.358 --> 13:28.660
Your mom doesn't seem to need an apology.

13:28.694 --> 13:30.361
Or she's just too
uncomfortable to ask for one!

13:30.396 --> 13:33.364
I'm not just gonna smile and
pretend it never happened.

13:33.399 --> 13:34.866
And no one is asking you to.

13:34.900 --> 13:35.933
My mother is!

13:35.968 --> 13:37.635
You don't need to do what she says, Lena.

13:39.538 --> 13:41.039
You don't need her permission.

13:41.073 --> 13:43.574
You pull Nate aside and you
have a conversation with him.

13:43.609 --> 13:46.944
The conversation you want to have.
You want an apology, you get one.

13:51.017 --> 13:52.884
You don't seem very happy he's here.

13:55.121 --> 13:56.955
I know you said it's no big deal,

13:56.989 --> 14:00.826
but just because you had sex with Mat
once doesn't mean you have to do it again.

14:00.860 --> 14:02.594
If you're not ready, he'll understand.

14:04.430 --> 14:06.031
I wish I could take it back.

14:09.736 --> 14:11.236
Yeah, but you love him, right?

14:12.872 --> 14:15.373
Okay, so even if the timing wasn't right,

14:15.408 --> 14:16.775
at least the guy was.

14:17.877 --> 14:21.546
You're really lucky you lost your
virginity to someone that you love.

14:24.617 --> 14:25.951
Oh, my god. Is that...

14:26.085 --> 14:27.252
Wyatt. Yeah.

14:27.287 --> 14:29.188
He's life-guarding this
summer. You wanna come say hi?

14:30.290 --> 14:31.623
Okay.

14:33.893 --> 14:35.427
- Hey!
- (Gasps)

14:36.069 --> 14:37.736
Wanna get in the water?

14:37.771 --> 14:41.207
Um, actually, we should get out of here.

14:42.242 --> 14:43.909
I thought you wanted to
spend the day with Callie.

14:44.911 --> 14:47.079
Honestly, she's kinda getting on my nerves.

14:47.114 --> 14:49.748
It's fine. Let's just go. Are you hungry?

14:49.783 --> 14:50.883
Yeah.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.161
Hey, buddy.

14:55.195 --> 14:56.629
Save it. I'm not your buddy.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.464
Whoa. Why so aggro?

14:58.499 --> 15:00.299
Is this how you're gonna
play this, really? Dumb?

15:00.334 --> 15:01.667
Play what?

15:01.702 --> 15:03.269
You and Kat, setting me up.

15:04.605 --> 15:05.605
What are you talking about?

15:07.074 --> 15:08.241
You get me to that party

15:08.275 --> 15:09.776
so she can make me think she's sleeping in,

15:09.810 --> 15:11.477
and when I don't show up
to work in the morning,

15:11.512 --> 15:13.279
I look like a flake in front of Chris.

15:13.313 --> 15:16.082
All so that he'll let the
two of you work together.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.751
- Dude, that's insane.
- Is it?

15:18.786 --> 15:20.820
Maybe. Either way, I'm still here.

15:20.854 --> 15:22.355
Okay? It didn't work.
I'm still stuck with Kat.

15:22.389 --> 15:24.056
And you know what, I might
have to deal with her,

15:24.091 --> 15:25.224
but I don't have to deal with you.

15:32.199 --> 15:33.733
(Cell phone bleeps)

15:35.969 --> 15:39.872
Oh! I gotta get over to the
hall and help him set up.

15:39.907 --> 15:41.340
Oh, okay. Um...

15:42.409 --> 15:44.577
So I'll see you there.
What time should we...

15:44.611 --> 15:46.813
No, I'm gonna pick you up.

15:46.847 --> 15:48.481
What kinda gentleman do you think I am?

15:48.515 --> 15:49.203
Okay. What time?

15:49.617 --> 15:50.984
6:00?

15:51.018 --> 15:53.053
That works. I'll see you then.

15:53.087 --> 15:54.387
Yes, you will.

15:58.659 --> 16:00.260
What?

16:00.294 --> 16:02.128
You like him.

16:02.163 --> 16:03.296
Yeah, as a friend.

16:03.331 --> 16:07.067
Well, he likes you, and not as a friend.

16:07.101 --> 16:10.170
Trust. Tonight? That's a date.

16:10.204 --> 16:11.638
A date-date.

16:11.672 --> 16:12.239
You're ridiculous.

16:12.473 --> 16:14.474
I saw him checking you out.

16:14.509 --> 16:17.010
What that dude was thinking
was definitely not friendly.

16:24.085 --> 16:25.485
How's that book?

16:27.121 --> 16:28.488
- (Knock on door)
- Come in.

16:33.761 --> 16:35.095
Hey!

16:35.129 --> 16:36.797
Is that what you're wearing?

16:36.831 --> 16:39.499
I know Cole said it was
creative black tie, but...

16:39.534 --> 16:43.070
No. I didn't wanna tell my
dad where I was going, so...

16:43.104 --> 16:44.304
I brought some stuff.

16:45.757 --> 16:47.358
You look great.

16:47.392 --> 16:48.526
Thanks.

16:48.560 --> 16:49.894
It's Jesus'.

16:49.928 --> 16:50.928
A.J. picked it out.

16:52.464 --> 16:55.666
I was going to get you a corsage,

16:55.701 --> 16:57.602
but I figured this would last longer.

16:59.303 --> 17:01.403
_

17:04.276 --> 17:05.309
It's a joke.

17:05.344 --> 17:06.810
Yeah. I got it.

17:07.980 --> 17:09.413
- (Doorbell rings)
- I got it!

17:12.718 --> 17:13.818
Oh, my goodness.

17:13.853 --> 17:15.854
Don't you look so dapper. Please, come in.

17:15.887 --> 17:16.921
Thank you.

17:16.955 --> 17:19.156
Callie, Cole's here! Lena, get your phone!

17:19.191 --> 17:21.326
Dana, Stewart. This is
Cole, Callie's friend.

17:21.359 --> 17:22.560
- Hi.
- How do you do?

17:22.595 --> 17:24.395
- I'm good.
- How are you, Cole?

17:24.430 --> 17:26.664
- So handsome.
- What's up, Cole?

17:26.699 --> 17:28.133
- You lookin' tight.
- Hey! Thank you.

17:28.166 --> 17:29.334
Lovin' the suit.

17:29.368 --> 17:31.169
(Gasps) Oh, my god!

17:31.203 --> 17:33.204
Look at our beautiful girl, Stewart.

17:34.680 --> 17:36.782
Freeze! Freeze right there.
Lena, you getting this?

17:36.816 --> 17:39.050
You look so beautiful, Callie.

17:39.085 --> 17:42.587
Hey! None of this half-smile
crap. Come on, smile.

17:42.622 --> 17:45.824
- Oh, Callie, look how beautiful you look when you smile...
- Look at that.

17:45.858 --> 17:48.393
Hey! Jude, Connor! Let's go boys. Let's go!

17:48.428 --> 17:50.829
Look at how nice y'all two match.

17:50.863 --> 17:52.497
Nice dress.

17:52.532 --> 17:55.333
Oh, this? No! I picked it up from the
vintage store on my way home from the beach.

17:55.368 --> 17:56.368
It's nothing.

17:56.402 --> 17:58.303
Well, you look amazing.

17:58.337 --> 18:00.172
Thank you.

18:00.206 --> 18:01.907
Okay, you guys, get together. Come on.

18:01.981 --> 18:03.215
That's a nice corsage.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.250
Callie! Smile! Please smile.

18:06.820 --> 18:08.454
Can this be over now?

18:08.488 --> 18:09.755
Stop!

18:11.124 --> 18:13.926
And look at our beautiful boys!

18:13.960 --> 18:15.594
(All exclaiming in awe)

18:15.628 --> 18:18.797
Jude, why so serious, my
friend? Let me see some teeth.

18:18.832 --> 18:21.333
Wait, wait. Look like you're
looking at Connor for the first time.

18:21.367 --> 18:23.368
You're seeing him, "oh,
look how he's so handsome."

18:23.403 --> 18:24.436
Mom, seriously?

18:24.471 --> 18:25.604
Yes, I'm totally serious.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.272
Okay, you guys, group shot. Get together.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.275
Hurry up. Hurry up.
You're going to be late.

18:29.309 --> 18:31.210
Here we go. All right.
And no blinking, my babies.

18:31.244 --> 18:32.611
You ready? One, two, three...

18:34.548 --> 18:35.915
- Aw!
- (Mouthing)

18:35.949 --> 18:38.250
Here we go. Smile, Callie.

18:40.086 --> 18:42.555
Honey, this is missing something.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.727
- Cayenne.
- Hmm.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.328
Lena, dear, do you have any cayenne?

18:51.432 --> 18:54.067
Look, I know Nate's
bringing his girlfriend,

18:55.102 --> 18:57.237
but I'm gonna pull him
aside and talk to him.

18:57.271 --> 19:00.006
You may not need to and
that's fine, but I do.

19:00.040 --> 19:01.341
(Doorbell ringing)

19:06.747 --> 19:08.014
Hi, Lena.

19:09.250 --> 19:10.283
Hi, Dad, Dana.

19:11.252 --> 19:12.552
This is Faith.

19:12.586 --> 19:13.786
Hi.

19:15.156 --> 19:16.156
Hi.

19:20.901 --> 19:23.100
I'll never understand
how you don't like moka.

19:23.205 --> 19:25.473
I don't like coffee with my ice cream!

19:25.507 --> 19:26.674
Leave me alone.

19:26.708 --> 19:28.342
I like my chocolate just fine, thank you.

19:30.712 --> 19:31.779
So, um...

19:32.781 --> 19:34.648
There's nobody home at my place.

19:35.684 --> 19:37.418
Oh.

19:37.452 --> 19:39.120
Do you wanna head over there?

19:40.422 --> 19:41.689
So what?

19:41.723 --> 19:43.991
We'll just have sex and then
you'll leave me in the morning?

19:46.027 --> 19:47.128
Oh, I thought...

19:48.263 --> 19:49.930
I thought that's what you wanted.

19:51.333 --> 19:53.000
That was before, but...

19:53.034 --> 19:55.536
you were right, I think we should wait.

19:55.570 --> 19:58.005
And you'll be home in
a couple of weeks, so...

20:00.375 --> 20:01.642
Oh, actually...

20:02.778 --> 20:03.778
What?

20:05.514 --> 20:07.848
We're extending... the tour.

20:09.818 --> 20:11.051
For how long?

20:12.888 --> 20:14.255
So how long have you two been together?

20:14.290 --> 20:16.157
Oh, what? Six months now?

20:16.192 --> 20:17.625
Has it only been six months?

20:17.660 --> 20:18.893
Oh! Gee, thanks.

20:18.928 --> 20:22.130
No! No, I mean...

20:22.164 --> 20:23.731
It feels like we've just

20:23.766 --> 20:25.633
always been in each other's lives.

20:25.668 --> 20:26.801
It was meant to be.

20:26.836 --> 20:28.236
That was well played, Nate.

20:29.905 --> 20:31.873
I wouldn't mind some more grandchildren.

20:31.907 --> 20:34.042
- Wink-wink.
- Stewart...

20:34.076 --> 20:36.010
Well, the thought has
certainly crossed my mind.

20:36.045 --> 20:40.448
Mmm. Do I dare open another bottle?

20:40.482 --> 20:42.617
Sure, I don't see why not.
We're just getting started.

20:42.651 --> 20:45.820
- I'm gonna go check on the roast, honey.
- Okay.

20:53.095 --> 20:54.696
Did you...

20:54.730 --> 20:56.798
Did you know that Nate
was dating a black girl?

20:56.832 --> 20:58.433
No, he never mentioned it.

20:58.467 --> 20:59.968
Don't you think it's a little odd?

21:00.002 --> 21:01.950
Uh, no. You didn't
mention that Stef was white

21:01.951 --> 21:02.931
when you started dating her.

21:09.242 --> 21:10.342
What?

21:11.344 --> 21:13.145
How am I supposed to have a
conversation with Nate now?

21:14.180 --> 21:15.280
What do you mean?

21:15.315 --> 21:17.182
Don't you think it would be
just a little bit offensive

21:17.216 --> 21:19.017
with his black girlfriend
sitting in the next room?

21:20.019 --> 21:21.920
No. It shouldn't, should it?

21:21.954 --> 21:24.990
I think it was a brilliant
way to shut me down.

21:25.024 --> 21:26.058
Really, Lena?

21:26.092 --> 21:28.160
You think he's dating
an African-American woman

21:28.194 --> 21:30.128
just to prove to you that he's not racist?

21:30.163 --> 21:31.663
Or to himself.

21:31.698 --> 21:33.165
(Sighs) Or...

21:33.199 --> 21:34.433
Maybe she's not really his girlfriend.

21:34.467 --> 21:38.103
Maybe he hired an actress
to play his girlfriend, huh?

21:39.305 --> 21:40.505
Never know.

21:43.243 --> 21:44.977
(Dance music playing)

21:53.420 --> 21:54.787
Hey, guys. How's it going?

21:54.821 --> 21:57.156
Um, this is my date, Callie.

21:57.190 --> 21:59.525
So, this is the infamous Callie.

21:59.559 --> 22:00.959
No wonder you talk about her all the time.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.700
(Indistinct chattering)

22:17.343 --> 22:18.710
Hey, welcome.

22:18.745 --> 22:20.012
I'm Jonah. I'm gay.

22:20.046 --> 22:23.482
How's it going? Lennon, gender-queer.

22:23.516 --> 22:25.617
My preferred pronouns
are "they" and "them."

22:25.652 --> 22:29.054
I'm Connor. Gay.

22:29.089 --> 22:30.055
I'm Jude.

22:33.059 --> 22:34.093
Hey, Jude.

22:35.295 --> 22:36.728
So... what are you?

22:36.763 --> 22:38.664
Just Jude.

22:38.698 --> 22:40.999
And you guys are a couple?

22:42.001 --> 22:43.102
Yeah.

22:43.136 --> 22:45.304
Let me guess, this is your first gay dance?

22:48.058 --> 22:50.226
(Playing piano piece)

23:06.977 --> 23:09.746
So what do we think of Brandon's fugue?

23:10.748 --> 23:11.781
I think it's great.

23:11.815 --> 23:13.316
I think it shows a lotta growth.

23:13.350 --> 23:16.686
Personally, I think it's less
imaginative than his first pass.

23:16.720 --> 23:19.322
Really? You think it's unimaginative?

23:19.356 --> 23:19.880
Mmm-hmm.

23:20.011 --> 23:22.579
I'll be sure to tell Johann
Sebastian Bach you said so.

23:24.382 --> 23:27.284
Wait, this is Bach?

23:27.318 --> 23:29.386
Yes. It's obscure.

23:29.420 --> 23:32.489
It's almost completely unknown, in fact,

23:32.523 --> 23:33.523
but it's Bach.

23:40.879 --> 23:42.113
Having fun?

23:42.147 --> 23:45.816
Sure, I mean. We just got here, but yeah.

23:45.851 --> 23:47.518
So what's the deal with your boyfriend?

23:47.553 --> 23:50.288
He's not gay, he's "just Jude"?

23:51.356 --> 23:53.124
He doesn't really like labels...

23:53.158 --> 23:54.625
Ah! I see.

23:54.660 --> 23:56.594
Translation, he's not sure he's gay.

23:56.628 --> 23:58.362
Been there, done that, girl.

24:00.966 --> 24:02.066
Been where? Done what?

24:02.100 --> 24:04.669
Been with boys who are curious or whatever.

24:04.703 --> 24:06.404
Listen, I'm only telling you this,

24:06.438 --> 24:08.839
because I wish someone had
warned me when I was your age,

24:08.874 --> 24:11.175
but if a guy can't say he's gay,

24:11.210 --> 24:12.877
it's because he ain't sure he is.

24:13.011 --> 24:15.913
And queen, that just means
he's gonna end up dumping you

24:15.948 --> 24:17.482
and breaking your baby-gay heart.

24:25.408 --> 24:26.575
Need anything?

24:28.177 --> 24:30.612
No. The roast just needs
to rest for a little bit.

24:34.584 --> 24:35.684
Faith is lovely.

24:35.718 --> 24:36.952
Isn't she?

24:41.991 --> 24:43.358
You know what...

24:44.794 --> 24:46.695
I should've said this earlier,

24:46.729 --> 24:49.097
thank you for reaching out at Christmas.

24:49.132 --> 24:50.232
It meant a lot.

24:52.001 --> 24:53.034
Don't mention it.

24:58.858 --> 25:00.426
(Hip-hop music playing)

25:12.439 --> 25:13.772
Hey, there you are.

25:13.807 --> 25:16.041
- What're you doing?
- Dancing.

25:16.076 --> 25:17.743
It's a gay dance, right?

25:17.777 --> 25:20.312
This is stupid. Can we just go?

25:20.347 --> 25:22.114
If you want to leave, then just go.

25:22.148 --> 25:23.682
Whatever...

25:23.717 --> 25:25.184
But I'm gonna stay.

25:25.218 --> 25:26.919
I'm having a good time.

25:26.953 --> 25:30.189
But you know, I'm gay, so...

25:45.105 --> 25:47.306
Seriously, you signed
your name to a Bach fugue?

25:47.341 --> 25:48.541
(Scoffs) Wow!

25:48.575 --> 25:51.911
I only recognized it because
I wrote my thesis on Bach.

25:51.945 --> 25:53.746
I know that, Teri. That's why I picked it.

25:53.780 --> 25:56.515
I read your bio. I knew you'd recognize it.

25:56.550 --> 25:57.717
What a joke.

25:57.751 --> 25:59.352
And I knew you would say it was crap.

25:59.386 --> 26:00.853
Oh, please.

26:00.887 --> 26:04.056
You plagiarized and got caught, and now
you're just trying to cover your ass.

26:04.091 --> 26:06.492
I did the work. Here's my original piece.

26:06.526 --> 26:08.928
- You actually wrote that one, right?
- Yes.

26:08.962 --> 26:12.865
Well, you've certainly managed to
prove that you can't work together.

26:12.899 --> 26:16.335
But quite frankly, I've had enough of
you two making a joke of this program.

26:16.370 --> 26:17.670
What does that mean?

26:17.704 --> 26:20.506
I don't know. I need to talk with Chris.

26:20.510 --> 26:22.945
We'll see you at seminar tonight
and let you know what we decide.

26:29.957 --> 26:31.992
I mean, she's always been so sweet.

26:32.026 --> 26:34.294
Um, once we were at the pier,

26:34.328 --> 26:36.363
and Lena accidentally
let go of her balloon,

26:36.397 --> 26:38.498
- and she just sobbed.
- Stewart: Yeah. I remember that!

26:38.532 --> 26:40.267
I was gonna get her another one,

26:40.301 --> 26:42.002
but that wasn't why she was crying.

26:42.036 --> 26:45.405
She said that she was afraid
that it would land in the ocean

26:45.439 --> 26:46.973
and choke a dolphin to death.

26:47.008 --> 26:48.208
Aw!

26:48.242 --> 26:51.144
Our Lena has always been very sensitive.

26:51.178 --> 26:53.513
Actually, I didn't lose it... the balloon.

26:54.649 --> 26:57.651
Nate took it from me, and
let it go to make me cry.

26:57.685 --> 27:00.186
- Oh!
- Really?

27:00.905 --> 27:03.273
It's true.

27:03.308 --> 27:05.008
Typical older brother stuff.

27:06.044 --> 27:08.178
I'm sorry I was such an ass.

27:08.212 --> 27:10.013
Just add that to my long list of regrets.

27:11.449 --> 27:16.286
And, Lena, I know I owe you
and Dana and Dad, I guess,

27:16.321 --> 27:17.321
an apology.

27:19.257 --> 27:20.857
I...

27:20.892 --> 27:24.094
I feel terrible for stealing them
away from you guys last Christmas.

27:24.128 --> 27:26.797
And I know it was hard being
away from the grandkids,

27:28.132 --> 27:31.435
so anyway, I'm sorry

27:31.469 --> 27:34.805
and I'll try to be more
considerate in the future.

27:36.551 --> 27:38.719
Well, Nate, that was just one Christmas.

27:38.754 --> 27:41.422
We're really sorry about
all the many Christmases

27:41.456 --> 27:43.491
that we didn't spend with you.

27:44.726 --> 27:46.394
Don't do that, Mom.

27:46.428 --> 27:48.162
Don't you dare apologize to him.

27:48.196 --> 27:50.164
- Stewart: Lena?
- Lena, please.

27:51.199 --> 27:53.868
Do you really think Christmas is the
only thing you have to apologize for?

27:55.470 --> 27:56.604
What's going on?

27:56.638 --> 27:59.240
He said he was sorry
for teasing you as a kid.

27:59.274 --> 28:00.841
Siblings fight.

28:02.811 --> 28:04.045
Mmm?

28:04.079 --> 28:05.246
Seriously, Mom?

28:08.250 --> 28:10.484
Lena, please don't do
this in front of our guest.

28:15.757 --> 28:16.757
Lena?

28:21.830 --> 28:22.964
Excuse me.

Hey!

29:09.607 --> 29:10.807
What are you doing out here?

29:12.076 --> 29:14.444
I think I'm gonna call
my moms to come get me.

29:15.479 --> 29:16.679
What happened?

29:18.382 --> 29:21.317
Connor freaked out because
I won't say I'm gay.

29:21.352 --> 29:23.753
But I don't get it, why do I
have to call myself anything?

29:25.656 --> 29:27.624
Look, I...

29:27.658 --> 29:32.996
I understand not wanting to
have to check a box or whatever,

29:34.298 --> 29:35.899
but there's power in
labels, too, you know...

29:37.701 --> 29:41.004
When I was at Girls United, most of
the girls refused to call me "he."

29:42.573 --> 29:44.574
And my label is what got me through.

29:44.608 --> 29:49.579
My label got me into an LGBT
home where I can just be...

29:51.048 --> 29:52.282
you know...

29:53.817 --> 29:55.685
me.

29:55.719 --> 29:57.020
No questions asked.

29:57.779 --> 29:59.713
I'm not saying labels are for everyone...

30:02.450 --> 30:03.884
but sometimes they can...

30:07.755 --> 30:09.056
I don't know...

30:10.558 --> 30:12.192
make us feel not so alone.

30:16.364 --> 30:17.397
You're lucky.

30:17.432 --> 30:20.334
You live in a home where you can just be...

30:21.803 --> 30:23.237
Whoever you want to be.

30:27.842 --> 30:29.643
I guess not everyone has it so good, huh?

30:35.951 --> 30:37.618
Am I wrong about this?

30:37.652 --> 30:40.554
Am I just holding on to
something I need to let go of?

30:42.691 --> 30:45.593
Mom, I don't want another
lecture from you. I get it.

30:45.627 --> 30:47.895
You don't understand where
I'm coming from. You never do.

30:47.929 --> 30:49.530
And if I'm feeling something that

30:49.564 --> 30:52.166
you don't understand, then you make me
feel like I'm wrong for even feeling it.

30:52.200 --> 30:53.934
That is not true.

30:53.969 --> 30:55.469
It is true, Dana.

30:55.503 --> 30:59.006
When it comes to Lena, I'm sorry,
but you can be very dismissive.

30:59.040 --> 31:01.575
I'm sorry, Stef, but this
is none of your business.

31:01.610 --> 31:03.043
I beg to differ.

31:04.196 --> 31:07.865
You want to be protective of
Stewart? Well, I want to protect Lena.

31:07.900 --> 31:10.401
I understand that you don't want
him to be hurt by what Nate said,

31:10.435 --> 31:13.571
but Lena was and still is.
How can you not see that?

31:13.605 --> 31:15.439
Okay, fine. So maybe you're right.

31:15.474 --> 31:18.576
Maybe I don't understand
why you're so hurt.

31:19.578 --> 31:22.046
What Nate said to me was horrible,

31:22.080 --> 31:24.348
but he said it to me.

31:24.383 --> 31:27.218
Why does it have to matter so much to you?

31:27.252 --> 31:30.221
Because, Mom, when someone
calls one person the n-word,

31:30.255 --> 31:32.356
it doesn't just hurt that black person.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.625
It hurts all of us. That word cuts.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.460
Whether you're black, or your mixed...

31:37.436 --> 31:39.571
Especially when it's
directed at someone you love,

31:39.605 --> 31:41.072
at your mother, your hero.

31:43.709 --> 31:45.210
It would have hurt less
if he'd said it to me.

31:45.244 --> 31:47.345
And what if he did?
What if he said it to me?

31:47.380 --> 31:49.347
Would you be so quick
to forgive and forget?

31:53.686 --> 31:56.021
Since Kat and Brandon don't
seem to be able to work together,

31:56.055 --> 31:59.157
they'll need to find someone willing
to double up in order to work with them.

31:59.191 --> 32:02.460
That means twice the work for a composer

32:02.495 --> 32:03.995
willing to team up with Kat,

32:04.030 --> 32:06.531
and twice the work for a pianist

32:06.565 --> 32:09.000
willing to take on Brandon.

32:09.035 --> 32:10.935
Let's start with Kat.

32:10.970 --> 32:13.104
Is there a composer that
would like to work with her?

32:21.247 --> 32:22.514
No one?

32:26.852 --> 32:28.453
I'm sorry, Kat, you're out.

32:29.239 --> 32:31.774
Seriously? Nobody?

32:32.976 --> 32:34.109
Tony?

32:38.048 --> 32:41.517
(Scoffs) I am the most
talented pianist here.

32:41.551 --> 32:43.018
Pack your things and go home, Kat.

32:44.588 --> 32:46.155
You are making a big mistake.

32:49.926 --> 32:51.327
So what about Brandon?

32:51.361 --> 32:53.095
Is there a pianist

32:53.129 --> 32:55.297
willing to double up and work with him?

33:01.138 --> 33:03.139
Is everything okay?

33:03.173 --> 33:05.575
Nate, Lena and I...

33:06.743 --> 33:08.077
We need an apology.

33:08.111 --> 33:09.879
An apology for what?

33:09.913 --> 33:12.148
For calling me that hateful word.

33:12.182 --> 33:13.616
Wait, what word?

33:14.618 --> 33:15.618
You know what word.

33:18.188 --> 33:19.322
When did this happen?

33:19.356 --> 33:21.123
The summer he came to visit

33:21.158 --> 33:22.358
and he left early.

33:23.560 --> 33:25.962
Nate got angry with me,

33:25.996 --> 33:27.263
- and called me a...
- No. No.

33:28.599 --> 33:29.699
Is this true?

33:29.733 --> 33:32.401
No, I mean...

33:33.971 --> 33:34.671
Not that I recall.

33:34.705 --> 33:35.838
Did you call my wife that word?

33:35.873 --> 33:37.507
I would never say that.

33:40.110 --> 33:41.678
Maybe you misheard?

33:42.813 --> 33:43.813
No.

33:48.052 --> 33:49.152
Nate.

33:52.356 --> 33:53.890
You're not going to apologize?

33:55.125 --> 33:56.626
You're gonna take her word over mine?

33:56.660 --> 33:58.227
(Sighs)

34:01.999 --> 34:04.801
I'm sorry, Faith, that you
had to be a party to this,

34:04.835 --> 34:06.602
but I'm going to have
to ask you both to leave.

34:10.174 --> 34:13.242
Of course, you choose them.

34:16.347 --> 34:17.580
You always did.

34:20.516 --> 34:21.684
Let's go.

34:31.562 --> 34:33.295
How come you never told me about this

34:33.330 --> 34:34.496
in all these years?

34:34.531 --> 34:39.168
Because I was afraid that
you would never forgive him.

34:40.571 --> 34:41.737
You were right.

34:52.922 --> 34:54.088
Why did you want to be my date?

34:55.424 --> 34:57.058
- Because...
- Because you felt sorry for me?

34:57.092 --> 34:59.594
I don't need a pity date.

35:03.199 --> 35:05.533
I saw the way you looked at me when
I took my shirt off at the beach.

35:05.568 --> 35:08.236
Just say it, you won't date me
because you don't see me as a guy.

35:08.270 --> 35:09.637
That is so unfair.

35:09.672 --> 35:12.807
I've always treated you
like a guy, Cole, always.

35:12.842 --> 35:14.676
I won't date you because
I see you as a friend!

35:14.710 --> 35:16.945
What am I supposed to date
every single guy I know?

35:16.979 --> 35:20.081
I've had two boyfriends
in my life, Cole. Two!

35:20.115 --> 35:21.850
And you know what I really
don't need right now?

35:21.884 --> 35:23.718
Is another boyfriend.

35:23.752 --> 35:24.819
I need a friend.

35:25.855 --> 35:27.756
Okay, I'm sorry if that's
not good enough for you.

35:30.259 --> 35:32.127
And I've never pitied you.

35:33.462 --> 35:35.830
Okay? I look up to you.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.302
I mean, look at this, look at what you did.

35:40.336 --> 35:42.404
You made this party happen.

35:43.439 --> 35:46.074
You're not just making
life better for yourself,

35:46.108 --> 35:48.576
you're making it better for
a lot of other people, too.

35:52.481 --> 35:54.349
You're such a bad-ass.

35:56.118 --> 35:58.153
My bad-ass. My bad-ass friend.

36:03.459 --> 36:05.694
Hi, I'm Jude...

36:05.728 --> 36:06.728
And I'm gay.

36:08.197 --> 36:10.665
You know what, I don't
think I can keep doing this.

36:11.701 --> 36:13.435
I know, and you won't have to.

36:14.470 --> 36:15.537
I promise.

36:15.571 --> 36:18.874
Because I am super gay for you.

36:21.477 --> 36:23.712
(Slow dance music playing)

36:27.617 --> 36:29.651
You wanna dance?

36:29.685 --> 36:30.919
I'd love to.

37:38.095 --> 37:39.662
Look, I know you're mad.

37:40.697 --> 37:43.699
You know what? I am mad,

37:43.734 --> 37:46.535
because you came down here, acting like
you were all worried about my feelings,

37:46.570 --> 37:49.739
when the truth is you just don't wanna
feel bad about extending the tour!

37:49.773 --> 37:51.207
You were just gonna have sex with me,

37:51.241 --> 37:52.908
and then tell me you were
gonna be gone all summer?

37:52.943 --> 37:54.110
- Mariana...
- You know what?

37:55.545 --> 37:57.546
You should just do your thing.

37:57.581 --> 38:00.983
Go on tour, have fun, party, whatever.

38:01.017 --> 38:02.651
I don't want you sitting around

38:02.686 --> 38:04.553
feeling guilty for not being with me,

38:04.588 --> 38:06.455
and then resenting me because of it.

38:06.490 --> 38:07.490
I don't resent...

38:07.494 --> 38:08.828
I don't want to have to worry all summer,

38:08.862 --> 38:10.229
and wonder where you are,

38:10.263 --> 38:11.430
what you're doing, who you're doing.

38:11.465 --> 38:12.665
Mariana, I told you, I'm not gonna...

38:12.699 --> 38:13.699
I don't want to feel guilty.

38:13.734 --> 38:15.334
What would you feel guilty about?

38:16.436 --> 38:18.070
I don't know.

38:18.105 --> 38:19.405
Not being with you.

38:19.439 --> 38:20.606
A lot of things.

38:22.543 --> 38:23.843
It's okay, Mat.

38:25.245 --> 38:27.613
Maybe it's just not our time.

38:29.049 --> 38:31.150
Mariana, please tell me you're not...

38:31.185 --> 38:33.553
Have a good tour.

38:33.587 --> 38:34.620
I'll see you this fall.

38:45.632 --> 38:47.800
- (Both whisper)
- I'm sorry.

38:47.835 --> 38:49.268
Baby, you want something else?

38:49.303 --> 38:50.536
No, I'm fine. Thanks.

38:53.240 --> 38:55.141
- Stef: Hi, sweets.
- Dana: There's my girl!

38:55.175 --> 38:56.609
Come give me a hug, honey.

38:56.643 --> 38:57.710
Mmm.

38:57.745 --> 38:59.445
- Stewart: Hey, baby.
- Where's Mat?

39:00.681 --> 39:02.982
He... he dropped me off.

39:03.017 --> 39:04.684
Well, have a seat. Get something to eat.

39:06.286 --> 39:07.286
Where's Nate?

39:08.722 --> 39:10.056
He...

39:10.090 --> 39:11.157
he had an early flight.

39:13.660 --> 39:16.362
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize
you guys were having dinner.

39:16.397 --> 39:17.964
- That's okay.
- You hungry?

39:17.998 --> 39:19.265
Come sit down and eat with us.

39:19.299 --> 39:21.334
I was just gonna grab a snack
and go finish watching the game.

39:21.368 --> 39:23.569
Oh, hush now. It's time you learn,

39:23.604 --> 39:24.871
no one says no to Grams.

39:24.905 --> 39:26.672
Well, that's true. The day I learned that,

39:26.707 --> 39:29.609
is the day life became
a heck-of-a-lot easier.

39:29.643 --> 39:31.244
And the prom king and queen are here.

39:32.646 --> 39:34.514
- You guys hungry?
- Always.

39:34.548 --> 39:35.882
Okay. One slice or two?

39:35.916 --> 39:37.150
- I'll have two.
- I'll just have one.

39:37.184 --> 39:39.685
Oh! But I'm gonna need to see
some ID from you, young lady.

39:39.720 --> 39:43.156
♪ Something came in the mail today! ♪

39:43.190 --> 39:44.757
Wait!

39:47.895 --> 39:49.462
Ah! My driver's license!

39:49.496 --> 39:50.596
Stewart: Congratulations!

39:50.631 --> 39:52.131
Oh! Gross, I look... Ugh!

39:54.134 --> 39:56.202
- Happy?
- I was gonna go with insane, but...

39:56.236 --> 39:58.237
I told you to practice.

39:58.272 --> 39:59.305
Why does no one listen to me?

39:59.339 --> 40:02.175
Callie finally got her license!

40:02.209 --> 40:04.410
Oh, my darling, the places you will go.

40:04.445 --> 40:06.479
Yeah, like work and school...

40:06.513 --> 40:08.114
And the trouble you will get into.

40:08.148 --> 40:11.117
Let's not put any ideas that she
doesn't already have in her head.

40:11.151 --> 40:12.318
This roast turned out pretty good.

40:12.352 --> 40:13.786
So, how was your date?

40:15.055 --> 40:17.056
Well, it turns out you were right.

40:17.091 --> 40:18.458
No need to gloat.

40:19.460 --> 40:21.294
Cole totally thought that was a date-date.

40:21.328 --> 40:22.328
Uh-huh.

40:22.362 --> 40:23.696
So how'd he take it?

40:23.730 --> 40:26.199
He was pretty mad at first, but
I think we worked through it.

40:26.233 --> 40:27.467
That's good. He's a cool guy.

40:29.103 --> 40:30.837
But I gotta admit, I was pretty jealous.

40:38.011 --> 40:40.246
Look at this. And here we
thought we'd have to wait

40:40.280 --> 40:42.449
until tomorrow to get together
with our beautiful brood.

40:42.983 --> 40:45.518
Yeah. All we need now is
for Brandon to come home.

40:47.154 --> 40:48.655
(All exclaiming)

40:49.710 --> 40:52.212
Grab a seat. Join the family dinner.

40:56.317 --> 40:57.684
Everything is delicious, honey.

40:59.120 --> 41:00.120
What's wrong?

41:00.154 --> 41:01.821
(Sighs) Nothing. I just got kicked out.

41:02.890 --> 41:05.191
- Of Idyllwild?
- Yeah. Long story.

41:06.193 --> 41:07.794
Can someone pass the potatoes?

41:08.963 --> 41:10.764
Potatoes? Oh, no, no, my darling.

41:10.798 --> 41:12.732
These are not potatoes.

41:12.767 --> 41:16.670
These are Gram's world-famous
gruyère-crusted potatoes au gratin!

41:16.704 --> 41:18.438
(All exclaiming)

41:18.472 --> 41:22.008
And everyone has to try them.

41:22.043 --> 41:23.843
A.J., Gramps has got your number.

41:23.878 --> 41:26.112
You'd better put some of those
potatoes on your plate now...
