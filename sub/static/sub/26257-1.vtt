WEBVTT

00:13.680 --> 00:17.392
Ya know, I just wanna find something
only I can do!

00:17.475 --> 00:19.561
-Totally.
-You're going to art school, right?

00:19.644 --> 00:23.314
It's nice knowing what you wanna do.
Hopefully I'll figure it out in 4 years,

00:23.398 --> 00:24.941
but I have no idea now.

00:25.025 --> 00:25.942
Don't worry!

00:26.026 --> 00:27.944
You'll have a goal no matter where you go.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.071
Just do what your gut tells you, ya know?

00:30.155 --> 00:31.531
Totally!

00:31.781 --> 00:33.908
<i>Something only you can do...</i>

00:35.285 --> 00:38.496
<i>What's something that only I can do?</i>

00:54.304 --> 00:58.767
AIR SELF-DEFENSE FORCE

01:06.733 --> 01:08.818
Keep coming.

01:23.333 --> 01:24.167
Okay. Open it.

01:32.133 --> 01:33.635
Mambo Viking 11.

01:34.177 --> 01:35.595
<i>After airborne.</i>

01:35.678 --> 01:38.389
<i>Maintain 2000 for area keep.</i>

01:38.973 --> 01:42.143
<i>Wind 080 at five.</i>

01:42.519 --> 01:45.313
<i>Runway 28 cleared for takeoff.</i>

01:45.772 --> 01:47.190
<i>Cleared for takeoff.</i>

01:47.565 --> 01:49.109
Mambo Viking 11.

02:04.624 --> 02:05.834
Amakasu.

02:06.584 --> 02:08.128
Amakasu!

02:09.003 --> 02:09.838
Yes, ma'am?

02:10.088 --> 02:14.384
Take this external interview application
to Flight Leader Kakiyasu.

02:14.884 --> 02:16.427
She's in Hangar 8.

02:17.011 --> 02:19.305
Hangar 8?

02:19.597 --> 02:21.391
But I've never gone to the northern...

02:21.683 --> 02:23.226
I'll lend you my moped.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.435
You'll be fine.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.062
-Ms. Akishima.
-Yes, sir!

02:26.563 --> 02:31.067
-Ogawa from the Tsuchiya Publishing...
-How is lending me your moped a solution?

02:31.151 --> 02:35.321
I've never been to the air test wing
or even knew that this Kakiyasu existed.

02:37.782 --> 02:39.200
Huh? Did you say something?

02:41.703 --> 02:42.537
Here.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.373
Thanks for taking care of it.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.879
I never expected it would be Amakasu.

02:51.129 --> 02:54.299
It seems she did very well
on the aptitude test.

02:54.799 --> 02:57.677
We'll just have to wait
and see what happens.

02:58.469 --> 03:00.597
-Oh, my tea leaf.
-Is it standing for good luck?

03:01.264 --> 03:02.348
It's broken...

03:04.058 --> 03:06.603
It only goes up to Hangar 7.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.939
Um... Hangar 8... Hangar 8...

03:10.023 --> 03:11.065
Yakult.

03:11.149 --> 03:12.817
Yakult... Ya--

03:14.777 --> 03:16.779
Don't you like Yakult?

03:16.988 --> 03:18.031
Here you go.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.741
STRAWBERRY YAKULT JOA

03:21.117 --> 03:22.118
Most likely,

03:23.036 --> 03:25.622
the place you're looking for

03:25.747 --> 03:27.624
is over there.

03:29.584 --> 03:31.252
Thank you very much.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.053
HANGAR 8

03:42.305 --> 03:45.558
Um... excuse me...

03:47.435 --> 03:51.814
Is there a flight leader
named Kakiyasu here...?

03:54.525 --> 03:56.194
Could this be

03:56.277 --> 04:01.074
systemic bullying concocted by women who
can't get married and other old weirdos?

04:02.575 --> 04:03.409
A pool?

04:06.663 --> 04:08.581
At a time like this...

04:15.046 --> 04:16.673
Ah, Goro!

04:16.756 --> 04:19.384
The world is such a cold, cruel place.

04:19.509 --> 04:23.638
Let me go back to the warmth
of your fluffy tummy.

04:35.400 --> 04:42.365
DRAGON PILOT: HISONE & MASOTAN

04:52.250 --> 04:54.502
Since long ago, we have been searching

04:54.585 --> 04:57.964
for the means to coexist
with Organic Transformed Flyers.

04:58.381 --> 05:02.218
Possession of Organic Transformed Flyers
allowed the nation to flourish,

05:02.427 --> 05:05.596
but also created a target for
neighboring countries to attack.

05:06.139 --> 05:10.977
As a result, our ancestors camouflaged
and hid the Organic Transformed Flyers

05:11.561 --> 05:14.230
with kites, feathered kimonos,
and banners.

05:14.731 --> 05:18.943
When control over them passed from
the shogunate to the government,

05:19.152 --> 05:23.531
concealment duties were run by
the Imperial Army and Naval air forces.

05:23.614 --> 05:26.743
Post-WWII, those duties were passed
to us, the Air Self-Defense Force.

05:27.076 --> 05:28.995
And what you encountered

05:29.078 --> 05:31.289
was one of those
Organic Transformed Flyers.

05:31.372 --> 05:34.751
A dragon, Hisone Amakasu.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.049
She wasn't listening, was she,
Ms. Kakiyasu?

05:41.215 --> 05:43.593
Commander Sosoda, it's only natural.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.137
Consider that she just met
a fantastical creature,

05:46.721 --> 05:51.309
was suddenly swallowed by said creature,
and just as suddenly spewed out.

05:56.105 --> 05:57.774
It's no use. He won't spit her up.

05:57.857 --> 05:59.275
Add in the emetic drugs!

06:05.114 --> 06:06.115
Vomit...

06:06.366 --> 06:07.408
Wonderful!

06:08.159 --> 06:10.578
Rather than fearing the creature itself,

06:10.661 --> 06:13.122
you seem more concerned
with being vomited out.

06:13.247 --> 06:17.335
You cope well with abnormal situations
and have flexible judgment.

06:17.960 --> 06:19.295
Hisone Amakasu,

06:19.379 --> 06:22.673
starting today, you'll join
the Organic Transformed Flyers,

06:22.840 --> 06:27.845
OTF for short, and become a dragon pilot.

06:27.929 --> 06:28.930
D...

06:29.597 --> 06:30.765
Dragon Pilot?!

06:30.848 --> 06:33.351
IT IS INSANE

06:33.851 --> 06:38.147
First off, let's officially
introduce you to the OTF.

06:38.523 --> 06:41.401
Um, I... I can't...

06:52.912 --> 06:56.290
The OTF are ordinarily deployed
from here, Hangar 8.

06:56.999 --> 06:58.292
Airman Okonogi.

06:58.709 --> 06:59.794
Y-Yes.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.422
He is the OTF maintenance leader.

07:03.464 --> 07:06.008
I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.

07:08.177 --> 07:10.012
You're very impressive, if I may say.

07:10.638 --> 07:12.640
To be chosen by an OTF.

07:12.890 --> 07:14.183
Chosen?

07:14.475 --> 07:18.104
To disperse their intense metabolic heat,

07:18.187 --> 07:20.148
the OTF need to fly in the sky.

07:20.690 --> 07:25.611
But for the past three years, this OTF
hasn't accepted any Dragon Pilots.

07:26.237 --> 07:31.117
Without a pilot, it can't fly much less
navigate an emergency situation.

07:31.868 --> 07:35.705
We've been able to cool it with the pool,
but we're at our limit.

07:35.955 --> 07:39.292
And you are our savior.

07:40.376 --> 07:41.294
N-No...

07:41.377 --> 07:43.796
I couldn't be a savior...

07:44.088 --> 07:46.090
Raising the OTF on the lift.

08:19.415 --> 08:22.835
-He's actually behaving today.
-Usually, he's like a spoiled brat.

08:23.127 --> 08:24.837
Now, try touching him!

08:24.921 --> 08:26.255
It's a strange encounter,

08:26.339 --> 08:27.840
just like E.T.!

08:28.591 --> 08:29.425
You don't know it?

08:29.800 --> 08:31.177
Look, just like this,

08:31.260 --> 08:32.678
take your finger and touch it!

08:35.223 --> 08:36.682
I...I can't...

08:45.316 --> 08:46.943
The OTF made the first move.

08:47.026 --> 08:48.027
She's the real deal.

08:48.444 --> 08:50.696
That's incredible, Amakasu!

08:54.033 --> 08:54.992
Amakasu?!

08:55.076 --> 08:57.954
Emetic! Get the emetic!

09:00.498 --> 09:02.458
AIR DEVELOPMENT & TEST WING
WOMEN'S BARRACKS

09:02.792 --> 09:06.546
Amakasu, you'll be residing
in these barracks from today.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.757
-I can't... I can't...
-OTF requires concealment,

09:09.840 --> 09:12.093
-so don't discuss it with others...
-That's why...

09:12.176 --> 09:13.386
I said I can't...

09:29.819 --> 09:32.029
Um... Would you like this?

09:41.205 --> 09:44.792
Cool it in the fridge!
It's freaking lukewarm!

09:45.334 --> 09:47.295
This is Airman 2nd Class Nao Kaizaki.

09:47.461 --> 09:50.506
She's also a Dragon Pilot cadet.
Get close with her.

09:51.007 --> 09:53.134
We aren't going to get along.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.094
I'll bully the hell out of you.

10:01.058 --> 10:03.436
<i>When being ejected from the OTF,</i>

10:04.228 --> 10:07.523
<i>cross both arms to reduce friction</i>

10:07.815 --> 10:10.276
<i>and protect your esophagus from harm.</i>

10:11.652 --> 10:12.528
<i>In an emergency...</i>

10:12.612 --> 10:15.615
Will I be thrown up again?

10:15.781 --> 10:18.951
By the way, you won't go out
the front door in an emergency.

10:20.369 --> 10:25.249
To prevent that, be sure to learn
the regular ejection procedure well.

10:26.834 --> 10:27.918
I can't...

10:28.002 --> 10:30.046
Amakasu's losing her spine!

10:30.129 --> 10:31.255
Hey, hey, hey!

10:31.631 --> 10:33.090
Keep coming!

10:48.064 --> 10:49.190
This is...

10:49.565 --> 10:50.399
We told you.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.485
-Keep coming!
-Since long ago,

10:52.610 --> 10:55.154
humans have had to camouflage the dragons.

10:55.738 --> 10:58.949
Since that is the duty
of the Air Self-Defense Force...

10:59.367 --> 11:02.286
What else could it be
other than a plane? Idiot.

11:03.245 --> 11:04.330
Rather than camouflage,

11:05.081 --> 11:06.499
it feels more like cosplay.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.087
Airman 3rd Class Amakasu,

11:11.212 --> 11:13.047
prepare for embarkation immediately.

11:13.130 --> 11:14.131
Huh?

11:14.256 --> 11:16.175
Before your flight training,

11:16.258 --> 11:19.595
you need to practice camouflaging the OTF
as a fighter aircraft.

11:19.970 --> 11:22.306
The OTF is set up and ready to go.

11:22.598 --> 11:24.392
Now, go get closer.

11:27.561 --> 11:28.562
You'll be fine.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.065
Just do exactly as directed
in the training video.

11:31.482 --> 11:34.235
You were chosen by the OTF.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.002
What are you waiting for?

11:52.294 --> 11:53.838
Secure your headpiece

11:53.921 --> 11:56.090
and let the OTF swallow you up.

11:59.343 --> 12:00.469
I...

12:03.097 --> 12:04.140
I...

12:05.433 --> 12:07.435
can't do it!

12:08.686 --> 12:09.520
Huh?

12:09.603 --> 12:10.521
What?

12:16.360 --> 12:20.197
You moron! You came this far
just to chicken out?!

12:20.281 --> 12:22.658
-She's screwing with us!
-What's the meaning of this?

12:23.868 --> 12:27.580
If you wanted to back out,
you had plenty of opportunities to do so.

12:27.997 --> 12:28.914
Why now?

12:28.998 --> 12:30.207
Fifteen times!

12:30.708 --> 12:32.585
I tried to back out 15 times.

12:32.668 --> 12:35.463
I said I can't. I especially can't.

12:35.921 --> 12:39.216
But every time you just ignored me!

12:39.550 --> 12:42.011
-Ah... Amakasu...
-Besides, my term is set!

12:42.386 --> 12:46.766
I was reassigned without being consulted,
and my term was extended, too!

12:46.849 --> 12:50.519
Is that not in violation
of the Labor Standards Act?!

12:50.603 --> 12:56.066
If I were to get on Twitter about this,
you'd have a huge problem on your hands!

12:56.150 --> 12:59.111
I don't even have a Twitter!

12:59.195 --> 13:00.738
-You...
-I can't believe it!

13:00.863 --> 13:03.699
Dragons, being puked out
the front, or the back...

13:03.783 --> 13:06.160
being pushed around
by some elementary school jerk...

13:06.243 --> 13:07.077
Why you little--

13:07.161 --> 13:08.537
You don't get to be indignant!

13:08.996 --> 13:13.083
Did you forget Self-Defense Forces Law,
Article 58 about behaving with dignity?

13:13.167 --> 13:16.587
Your hair may barely meet the standards,
but it's hardly appropriate here!

13:16.670 --> 13:19.465
I gave you my Joa
because I mistook you to be a kid!

13:19.548 --> 13:21.342
Actually, I feel I've been duped!

13:21.425 --> 13:24.428
I, too, have my own circumstances
and thoughts!

13:25.054 --> 13:27.765
I... I think...

13:30.309 --> 13:35.064
orange Joa tastes better than strawberry!

13:37.358 --> 13:38.192
Joa?

13:40.820 --> 13:45.282
Hiso Maso!

13:48.118 --> 13:50.037
Amakasu!

13:50.996 --> 13:53.624
I'm sorry it's so sudden.

13:53.916 --> 13:58.879
Yeah, it was really abrupt.
I'd be worried about me, too.

13:59.421 --> 14:03.259
At this rate, my future is going to be
controlled by utter darkness...

14:04.718 --> 14:06.011
I'll call you later!

14:08.055 --> 14:10.432
She's chattier than I thought.

14:10.558 --> 14:11.642
Amakasu.

14:12.309 --> 14:14.019
-I'm a chatterbox.
-Huh?

14:15.062 --> 14:16.146
Rather,

14:17.147 --> 14:22.027
I've got a huge personality problem!

14:24.905 --> 14:25.739
I tend to...

14:25.865 --> 14:28.242
always say what I think.

14:29.076 --> 14:33.289
My parents said that I should always
express my thoughts.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.040
I think it's a good thing.

14:35.124 --> 14:39.295
Like, if a fat person told me
they're worried about getting fat,

14:39.378 --> 14:42.172
I'd immediately tell them,
"Yes, you certainly are fat."

14:42.548 --> 14:43.549
I see.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.468
Even when you're trying to
cheer me up, Okonogi,

14:46.552 --> 14:48.304
I'd think you'd have ulterior motives.

14:48.387 --> 14:51.557
Or that because of your baby face
you smoke to try to look older,

14:51.640 --> 14:55.060
but you're still failing.
It all just falls out of my mouth.

14:55.144 --> 14:56.687
Is that... so...

14:59.064 --> 15:01.859
As long as I have thoughts,
they get voiced.

15:02.818 --> 15:04.695
That's why I thought

15:05.321 --> 15:06.989
I should just keep my mouth shut.

15:09.450 --> 15:10.701
I see...

15:13.037 --> 15:15.456
Thanks to you, we're in another bind.

15:16.206 --> 15:20.127
Everything was fine and dandy
while OTF was quiet.

15:20.878 --> 15:23.589
Why are they always making waves?

15:23.672 --> 15:25.507
Those darn Dragon Pilots.

15:25.591 --> 15:26.425
Hey,

15:26.508 --> 15:29.511
the Air Transport Unit
will be there to back you up.

15:29.595 --> 15:32.222
If you've got something to say
about the OTF Aviation Unit,

15:32.306 --> 15:34.016
take it up with Commander Sosoda.

15:34.308 --> 15:38.103
Your OTF needs us to follow in the air!

15:38.187 --> 15:40.481
You're always like this...

15:43.359 --> 15:44.485
I'll kill ya...

15:45.277 --> 15:46.111
I'll kill ya...

15:58.332 --> 16:01.585
The vertical stabilizer
is a little too close...

16:01.835 --> 16:03.963
and I'm not satisfied
with the front wheel...

16:06.548 --> 16:10.219
I kind of understand
why you picked Amakasu.

16:10.928 --> 16:14.431
You should be flying freely in the sky,

16:14.640 --> 16:17.393
but you're locked up here like this.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.228
Despite that, you still endure it.

16:19.728 --> 16:21.730
You have such great power,

16:21.897 --> 16:24.984
yet you stifle yourself
so as not to hurt anyone.

16:25.651 --> 16:29.113
Somehow, that sounds just like
what Amakasu was talking about.

16:32.741 --> 16:35.035
Sorry for my nonsensical ramblings.

16:35.202 --> 16:37.329
I'll be back after making the adjustments.

16:49.800 --> 16:50.843
Um, excuse me.

16:53.470 --> 16:55.139
I want to ask you something.

16:56.098 --> 16:59.226
Why did you choose me?

17:00.227 --> 17:04.648
I don't feel confident
that I can understand how you feel,

17:05.399 --> 17:07.693
especially since I'm nothing special.

17:08.152 --> 17:12.781
Plus, I offend everyone around me
and spoil the mood...

17:13.198 --> 17:15.159
But despite that,

17:15.534 --> 17:18.662
you still wanted me, didn't you?

17:25.753 --> 17:26.879
<i>What is this feeling?</i>

17:27.212 --> 17:32.926
<i>I feel like the mood is actually good</i>
<i>with this strange creature.</i>

17:34.344 --> 17:35.596
<i>What tranquil eyes...</i>

17:36.555 --> 17:38.932
<i>Why does he have such kind eyes?</i>

17:41.226 --> 17:42.061
E...

17:43.604 --> 17:44.688
E.T....

18:11.840 --> 18:13.092
She... did it.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.177
Amakasu broke out!

18:15.302 --> 18:17.554
Hip hip, hooray!

18:17.888 --> 18:19.139
Hip hip, hoo--

18:23.936 --> 18:24.937
That is not good.

18:28.023 --> 18:29.191
OTF is airborne.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.318
Stop the OTF!

18:31.401 --> 18:32.861
<i>We have no radio correspondence.</i>

18:32.945 --> 18:35.656
<i>It will be unknown due to</i>
<i>the absence of a flight plan.</i>

18:35.739 --> 18:38.450
Then set up a mid-air SOC!

18:38.784 --> 18:41.411
Amakasu isn't wearing a suit.

18:41.495 --> 18:44.039
At this rate, her life will be at risk!

18:49.336 --> 18:52.381
My skin is starting to tingle.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.300
Am I going to die?

18:55.592 --> 18:58.428
To everyone I've hurt
because of my frankness,

18:58.762 --> 19:00.556
I'm truly, deeply sorry.

19:00.639 --> 19:04.810
To my mom and dad
who taught me everything, thank you.

19:04.893 --> 19:09.314
Please forgive me for wasting your money
to raise me and for dying before you.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.984
I love you, Goro.

19:12.067 --> 19:14.945
I wish I could see you just one last time.

19:15.028 --> 19:17.406
You always purred for me
when I petted you.

19:17.489 --> 19:19.491
Purr, purr, purr...

19:31.253 --> 19:34.840
By chance are you happy
when you fly in the air?

19:38.093 --> 19:40.888
MOM: YOU CAN QUIT ANYTIME,
BUT FOR NOW GIVE IT YOUR ALL!

19:43.515 --> 19:44.641
Flight Leader Kakiyasu!

19:45.100 --> 19:47.352
Hisone Amakasu has made contact!

19:48.604 --> 19:50.606
<i>Um, Flight Leader Kakiyasu,</i>

19:50.689 --> 19:53.150
<i>I'm sorry this has gotten out of hand.</i>

19:53.525 --> 19:55.611
I'm still holding onto my life,

19:55.694 --> 19:58.989
but I at this rate, I might lose it
before I can apologize.

19:59.239 --> 20:00.741
I don't care about an apology!

20:01.200 --> 20:02.743
Where are you flying now?!

20:02.910 --> 20:05.204
How did you get a cell signal
from inside the OTF?!

20:05.287 --> 20:07.539
I got it! It's the rear riser headpiece!

20:08.916 --> 20:10.709
I can't pinpoint their location,

20:10.792 --> 20:14.338
but I've confirmed a signal coming from
the OTC prototype 16 safety visor!

20:14.838 --> 20:19.927
Maybe we're receiving correspondence
because Amakasu has the headpiece!

20:22.054 --> 20:25.057
Have the instrumentation unit determine
the OTF's position now!

20:25.265 --> 20:27.851
As soon as we have it,
send fighter planes to escort them!

20:28.227 --> 20:30.020
-<i>Amakasu!</i>
-Yes!

20:30.520 --> 20:31.355
Are you ready?

20:31.605 --> 20:34.107
I need you to do exactly as I direct you.

20:34.399 --> 20:35.525
-You got that?
-<i>Yes!</i>

20:35.901 --> 20:37.653
<i>You've got the headpiece on, right?</i>

20:37.778 --> 20:39.655
<i>Press the button on the back of it.</i>

20:40.447 --> 20:41.907
Y-You mean this?

20:43.867 --> 20:46.745
-The OTF control program is activated.
-Next!

20:46.828 --> 20:51.124
<i>Touch the PT-V2 module displayed</i>
<i>on the visor to start it up!</i>

20:51.875 --> 20:52.751
Um...

21:36.795 --> 21:38.297
FOXTROT

21:47.806 --> 21:50.767
It has changed from
Hotel mode to Foxtrot mode.

21:50.892 --> 21:51.727
She did that?

22:11.747 --> 22:13.165
It's beautiful.

22:14.583 --> 22:15.709
<i>Third Class Amakasu.</i>

22:16.084 --> 22:17.836
<i>Do you remember the landing operation?</i>

22:18.003 --> 22:19.046
Y-Yes.

22:19.421 --> 22:22.966
I'm supposed to rhythmically push my toes
toward my stomach,

22:23.258 --> 22:24.176
and--

22:28.889 --> 22:32.684
-Cancel! Tell me how to cancel!
-<i>Third Class Amakasu?!</i>

22:36.980 --> 22:37.814
I...

22:37.981 --> 22:39.483
I'm terribly sorry!

22:39.983 --> 22:41.777
Sheesh. Going rogue like that!

22:41.860 --> 22:44.946
Well, on the bright side,
at least she had that.

22:48.116 --> 22:51.370
That's a non-smart, flip phone, isn't it?

22:51.578 --> 22:54.331
Y-Yes, it is. What about it?

22:54.539 --> 22:55.957
Well, about that...

22:56.416 --> 22:59.086
OTF eat rare metals for meals.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.296
R-Rare metals?

23:01.797 --> 23:05.342
Everyone has switched
to smartphones lately.

23:05.759 --> 23:08.970
But his favorite food
is the flip phones.

23:09.096 --> 23:12.474
So you're saying he chose her
because she had a dumb phone?!

23:12.557 --> 23:14.935
Well, I can't say for sure...

23:15.018 --> 23:16.520
-That's right!
-Well...

23:16.603 --> 23:17.813
I'm getting a flip phone!

23:17.896 --> 23:19.356
I have a feeling that's not all.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.570
Yeah. I quit on quitting.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.740
I decided to try a little longer.

23:29.282 --> 23:31.076
Sorry! I'll call you later!

23:33.453 --> 23:35.831
-Excuse me!
-Did you find what you were looking for?

23:38.166 --> 23:40.669
I can't really explain it,

23:40.877 --> 23:44.131
but somehow... I guess...

23:44.965 --> 23:46.299
I think if I stay here,

23:46.716 --> 23:48.718
I'll find what I'm looking for.

23:49.761 --> 23:50.595
Huh?

23:54.182 --> 23:55.183
Excuse me!

23:55.642 --> 23:58.645
I like the orange-flavored Joa!

24:00.188 --> 24:01.940
Oh, that's right.

24:02.315 --> 24:03.608
STRAWBERRY YAKULT JOA

24:08.155 --> 24:12.033
I might be onto something
about that systemic bullying...

24:14.286 --> 24:15.120
Oh.

24:16.204 --> 24:17.038
It's good.

24:17.372 --> 24:18.665
TO BE CONTINUED

24:20.417 --> 24:22.794
<i>I felt something akin to fate.</i>

24:22.878 --> 24:25.422
<i>I'm only interested in your body.</i>

24:25.505 --> 24:26.673
