00:03.284 --> 00:05.517
Stay away from NCIS!

00:05.519 --> 00:06.718
This is Echo Bravo Nine.

00:06.720 --> 00:08.787
We have been targeted by
a surface-to-air missile.

00:08.789 --> 00:11.123
Everybody brace for impact!

00:12.025 --> 00:13.525
We have yet to pick up
a distress beacon.

00:13.527 --> 00:14.693
Get me the Russian embassy.

00:14.695 --> 00:16.862
<i>My office received word</i>
<i>of a downed aircraft.</i>

00:16.864 --> 00:19.364
I was not aware that it may
have been one of yours.

00:19.366 --> 00:20.832
It is ours, Mr. Pavlenko.

00:20.834 --> 00:22.401
Target of
a surface-to-air missile.

00:22.403 --> 00:24.503
The passengers-- where
are the special agents?

00:26.440 --> 00:28.674
You made this too difficult,
Agent Gibbs!

00:30.643 --> 00:32.144
Boss! Get in the truck!

00:34.247 --> 00:35.280
Sergei Mishnev.

00:35.282 --> 00:37.716
Our Intel says
Sergei survived.

00:37.718 --> 00:39.318
I hit him. He went down.

00:39.320 --> 00:40.819
He got up.

00:40.821 --> 00:42.254
And wherever he is now,

00:42.256 --> 00:44.089
there's a good chance
he'll be gunning for us.

00:45.792 --> 00:47.392
Not if we find him first.

00:50.330 --> 00:53.165
Did you see that kid's face
when I flashed my cuffs?

00:53.167 --> 00:56.101
She was 12 and sneaking
a smoke in the park.

00:56.103 --> 00:57.536
That was probably
her first cigarette.

00:57.538 --> 00:59.204
Eh, thanks to me,
she'll think twice

00:59.206 --> 01:00.772
before smoking
a second one.

01:00.774 --> 01:03.308
You're welcome,
health care system.

01:05.845 --> 01:08.580
Park's closed, ma'am.
Move along.

01:08.582 --> 01:11.149
Hey, unless you want to
put your hands together

01:11.151 --> 01:13.952
for old Simon and Garfunkel
here... move along.

01:20.493 --> 01:21.460
Oh, man.

01:21.462 --> 01:22.928
She's been strangled.

01:22.930 --> 01:27.232
Unit 20-21, reporting an ADW
in Town Center West.

01:27.234 --> 01:29.668
Request backup
and EMT code three.

01:29.670 --> 01:32.070
Geez, somebody
got her good.

01:33.140 --> 01:35.073
Oh, man,
she's still alive, Dave.

01:35.075 --> 01:36.241
Expedite medical assistance.

01:36.243 --> 01:37.876
It's okay, ma'am.

01:37.878 --> 01:38.910
Everything's gonna
be fine.

01:38.912 --> 01:40.178
We're gonna help you.

01:40.180 --> 01:42.714
Don't... touch me.

No.

Saw that one on HBO.

02:27.895 --> 02:29.327
Definitely not.

Okay, Tony, I think this list
of "sexy moves in the bedroom"

02:32.766 --> 02:33.999
is made up, like you said.

02:34.001 --> 02:36.034
I didn't say "made up""
I said "exotic""

02:36.036 --> 02:37.836
So you've heard of these things?

02:37.838 --> 02:39.671
Not just heard of them, McGoo.

02:40.406 --> 02:41.807
The amount of...
Okay, stop, stop.

02:41.809 --> 02:43.909
I'm sorry I asked.

02:43.911 --> 02:45.177
Number six, though, seriously?

02:45.179 --> 02:46.211
Really? You?

02:46.213 --> 02:48.613
Want me to tell you
about number six?

02:48.615 --> 02:50.215
No.

02:50.217 --> 02:52.150
Wait-- yes.

02:53.687 --> 02:55.554
It was a long time ago,
in France.

02:55.556 --> 02:57.889
I was young,
innocent, flexible.

02:57.891 --> 02:58.990
Before number six,

02:58.992 --> 03:00.392
I didn't know
that a woman could...

03:00.394 --> 03:01.860
fire a...

03:01.862 --> 03:03.061
jump shot,
that she could

03:03.063 --> 03:05.163
dunk it... women!

03:05.165 --> 03:06.665
WNBA, I follow it.

03:06.667 --> 03:08.200
You don't have to do that.

03:08.202 --> 03:10.368
The women are just as
competitive as the men.

03:10.370 --> 03:11.937
You don't have
to change the subject.

03:11.939 --> 03:13.305
I'm not the sex police.

03:13.307 --> 03:14.973
Kind of, you are.

03:16.309 --> 03:17.275
Um... hello?

03:17.277 --> 03:18.543
I'm married.

03:18.545 --> 03:20.212
I have more sex than
the two of you combined.

03:20.214 --> 03:22.447
From what I hear,
that's not how that works,

03:22.449 --> 03:23.648
but if you want--
All right.

03:23.650 --> 03:25.550
Give me that magazine,
smart ass.

03:26.252 --> 03:28.153
Let's see... hmm.

03:28.155 --> 03:30.055
Yes, yes, yes...

03:30.057 --> 03:31.189
Definitely yes.

03:31.191 --> 03:32.591
Definitely no.

03:32.593 --> 03:34.760
And... yes. Hmm.

03:34.762 --> 03:36.528
Number six?

03:36.530 --> 03:37.729
Are you double-jointed?

03:37.731 --> 03:39.898
It was kind of an accident.

03:39.900 --> 03:41.133
Jake and I went
camping once,

03:41.135 --> 03:43.468
and, uh, camp, uh...
we were on a camp...

03:43.470 --> 03:45.103
Grab your gear.

03:45.638 --> 03:46.638
Navy research scientist

03:46.640 --> 03:48.206
was attacked in the park.

03:48.208 --> 03:49.641
He still alive?

03:49.643 --> 03:52.477
Yes, she is.

03:54.847 --> 03:56.815
Actually, that's not
entirely true.

03:56.817 --> 03:58.316
The victim's dead, sir.

03:58.318 --> 03:59.518
Wait a second.

03:59.520 --> 04:01.653
But Dispatch said
Naval Research Scientist

04:01.655 --> 04:03.789
Sofia Glazman was
found alive.

04:03.791 --> 04:05.390
That report was later amended.

04:05.392 --> 04:07.125
The victim was alive
when we found her.

04:07.127 --> 04:08.827
Had a piece of wire
cutting into her neck.

04:08.829 --> 04:10.796
Looked like it was
pulled real tight.

04:10.798 --> 04:12.531
So we waited for EMTs.

04:12.533 --> 04:13.533
She say anything?

04:13.534 --> 04:14.699
Could barely talk.

04:14.701 --> 04:16.701
We asked about the
attack, who did it...

04:16.702 --> 04:19.171
But she just kept asking us
not to move her.

04:19.173 --> 04:20.438
Begging us not to.

04:20.440 --> 04:22.974
When the EMTs couldn't
get to the wire, either,

04:22.976 --> 04:25.377
we had no choice but to
get her to the hospital.

04:25.379 --> 04:26.511
She passed out
from blood loss.

04:26.513 --> 04:28.680
But they loaded her
into the ambulance.

04:28.682 --> 04:31.249
And that's when
things got ugly.

04:31.251 --> 04:33.919
We finally understood why
she didn't want to be moved.

04:34.787 --> 04:35.754
The body's in there.

04:35.756 --> 04:37.589
What happened?

04:38.559 --> 04:40.492
Nobody saw the device, sir.

04:43.696 --> 04:45.430
What's Ducky doing here?

04:45.432 --> 04:47.599
Well, at least somebody
got the updated report.

04:47.601 --> 04:49.601
Thanks, guys.

04:49.603 --> 04:50.869
Yeah.

04:52.738 --> 04:57.609
Ah, Jethro, there was a mix-up
in the initial case report.

04:57.611 --> 05:00.712
I trust you were able
to avoid the confusion?

05:00.714 --> 05:02.380
Two body bags, Duck?

05:02.382 --> 05:06.051
Ah, I see the confusion
still reigns.

05:13.693 --> 05:16.494
I know rule number two
is "always wear gloves""

05:16.496 --> 05:19.164
but when there's
this much blood...

05:19.166 --> 05:20.298
Rain gear.

05:20.300 --> 05:22.033
In the truck.

05:22.035 --> 05:24.336
When the head is
detached from the body,

05:24.338 --> 05:26.805
it's standard procedure to
transport them separately.

05:26.807 --> 05:29.541
Hence, the two body bags.

05:29.543 --> 05:31.610
I'm more interested in how.

05:31.612 --> 05:33.712
I think I found that out, boss.

05:36.916 --> 05:39.150
What is that,
a motorized garrote?

05:39.152 --> 05:41.953
Man... did you see
<i>The Counselor?</i>

05:41.955 --> 05:43.255
That was a pretty
good movie.

05:43.257 --> 05:45.090
I mean, what a cast--
you got Brad...

05:45.092 --> 05:46.291
Pitt...

05:46.293 --> 05:48.226
There's a bone stuck in this.

05:48.228 --> 05:49.961
A cervical vertebra.

05:49.963 --> 05:52.464
This thing acts like
a wire noose.

05:52.466 --> 05:56.201
Keeps getting tighter until it
pulls all the way closed.

05:56.203 --> 05:58.069
Explains the blood spray.

05:58.071 --> 06:01.640
Well, the carotid artery acts,
quite literally, as a spigot.

06:01.642 --> 06:05.243
No buttons, no timers,
just... on.

06:05.245 --> 06:08.146
Once the motor starts,
it doesn't stop.

06:08.148 --> 06:10.015
Well, apparently,
that one did.

06:10.017 --> 06:12.117
That's why the victim
begged not to be moved.

06:12.119 --> 06:14.219
I guess the motor
must have jammed.

06:14.221 --> 06:17.255
But... when they loaded her
onto the ambulance...

06:17.257 --> 06:20.091
Upon facing the guillotine,
it was common

06:20.093 --> 06:23.028
for the condemned to ask for
a sharpened blade.

06:23.030 --> 06:24.462
Make it clean, fast.

06:24.464 --> 06:26.331
Yeah, well,
this execution

06:26.333 --> 06:27.832
was purposely neither.

06:27.834 --> 06:30.302
They're sending a message.

06:32.000 --> 06:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:42.959 --> 06:46.028
Sofia was like
a granddaughter to me.

06:47.497 --> 06:50.532
Dr. Havana, do you know anyone
who could've done this?

06:51.468 --> 06:53.002
I won't look at those.

06:53.004 --> 06:54.904
And we will need
her laptop and notes

06:54.906 --> 06:56.839
back again today.

06:56.841 --> 06:58.841
We have a test run
tomorrow morning.

06:58.843 --> 07:00.743
It should be Sofia running it.

07:00.745 --> 07:03.145
You lab was working on
laser technology?

07:03.147 --> 07:05.447
Next big stick
in naval warfare.

07:05.449 --> 07:07.750
These lasers aren't weaponized.

07:07.752 --> 07:09.084
Data transfer?

07:09.086 --> 07:11.553
Yes. Very good.

07:11.555 --> 07:14.690
I read somewhere that NASA is
sending data to the Moon

07:14.692 --> 07:17.192
at 662 megabits per second.

07:17.194 --> 07:20.029
Word is that by using each color
on the light spectrum,

07:20.031 --> 07:22.331
that transfer speed
could be multiplied.

07:23.366 --> 07:25.367
Johns Hopkins. And MIT.

07:25.369 --> 07:27.503
Humble brag much?

07:27.505 --> 07:29.338
Don't worry,
I'm a Caltech man.

07:29.340 --> 07:31.674
Sworn enemies don't
get extra credit.

07:31.676 --> 07:34.743
Aren't both of
your mascots beavers?

07:36.479 --> 07:39.481
Uh, so, this
laser tech is valuable?

07:39.483 --> 07:41.684
Maybe in ten years,
when it's cost-effective,

07:41.686 --> 07:43.819
but, for now, everyone's
just trying to make it work.

07:43.821 --> 07:46.655
Including Ms. Glazman.

07:46.657 --> 07:48.157
I recruited her
when she was still

07:48.159 --> 07:50.826
at Moscow Institute of
Physics and Technology.

07:50.828 --> 07:53.128
Her parents died
when she was young.

07:53.130 --> 07:55.030
Practically raised herself.

07:55.032 --> 07:56.999
Becoming a U.S. citizen
and working here

07:57.001 --> 07:59.234
was a chance to start fresh.

07:59.236 --> 08:00.236
Was she seeing anyone?

08:00.237 --> 08:01.637
No.

08:01.639 --> 08:04.273
How could she have time to
have friends or a social life?

08:04.275 --> 08:06.909
She spent every spare
minute in the lab.

08:06.911 --> 08:08.077
Mm.

08:08.079 --> 08:09.311
Looks like a friend to me.

08:09.313 --> 08:11.847
Nelly Benin.

08:11.849 --> 08:15.317
Sofia's college lab partner
in Moscow.

08:15.319 --> 08:17.286
Sofia was recruited by us,

08:17.288 --> 08:19.888
Nelly stayed on and worked
for the Russians.

08:19.890 --> 08:22.291
But the two kept a...

08:22.293 --> 08:23.759
professional rivalry.

08:23.761 --> 08:25.894
Rivalry.
Hm.

08:25.896 --> 08:27.496
Professional, I said.

08:27.498 --> 08:31.633
The two of them were...
best of friends.

08:37.607 --> 08:38.607
Hey, Gibbs.

08:38.609 --> 08:40.708
I know this looks like
a lot of fun.

08:40.711 --> 08:44.413
But it's actually science
giving me unexpected answers.

08:44.415 --> 08:46.115
I don't know what to expect.

08:46.117 --> 08:47.516
Never seen
one of those before.

08:47.518 --> 08:49.184
I know.
It's fascinating, huh?

08:49.186 --> 08:51.420
I mean, if only there
were another use for it,

08:51.422 --> 08:52.488
then it would be cool.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.189
Bike lock.

08:54.191 --> 08:55.924
I like where you're
head's at.

08:55.926 --> 08:57.493
This motorized garrote

08:57.495 --> 08:59.194
would, indeed,
keep your bike safe

08:59.196 --> 09:01.530
but then you'd probably never
be able to move it again,

09:01.532 --> 09:02.898
at least not very easily.

09:02.900 --> 09:05.234
This is braided alloy,
and it's very, very hard to cut.

09:05.236 --> 09:06.502
Impressive.

09:06.504 --> 09:07.903
Oh, you should see the guts.

09:07.905 --> 09:10.172
Which were
super hard to get to

09:10.174 --> 09:11.507
and to reset.

09:11.509 --> 09:13.942
Every cog and coil
is custom-engineered

09:13.944 --> 09:15.144
for size and strength.

09:15.146 --> 09:17.212
It's like a perfect
killing machine.

09:17.214 --> 09:19.114
It's not that perfect, Abbs.
It broke down.

09:19.116 --> 09:20.749
Yeah, that's
what stumped me, too.

09:20.751 --> 09:21.784
At first.

09:21.786 --> 09:23.719
But then I swabbed
the inside,

09:23.721 --> 09:25.587
and I found a thin layer
of a chemical residue

09:25.589 --> 09:27.523
on the relay switch.
Get prints?

09:27.525 --> 09:30.159
No. And there's no hairs
and there's no fibers.

09:30.161 --> 09:32.161
But when I processed
the sticky gunk,

09:32.163 --> 09:33.495
it's actually...

09:33.497 --> 09:35.697
a smoke residue,
specifically from

09:35.699 --> 09:38.100
a strain of
cannabis sativa.

09:38.102 --> 09:39.535
Grass?

09:40.538 --> 09:41.937
Yeah. Grass.

09:41.939 --> 09:43.605
If you grew up
in the '60s.

09:43.607 --> 09:46.642
Um, and our killer
must've smoked a lot of it

09:46.644 --> 09:48.210
when they were
building this thing.

09:48.212 --> 09:50.512
Yeah, we used to
call that a "stoner."

09:50.514 --> 09:53.215
That term's actually
still culturally relevant.

09:53.217 --> 09:55.184
How's it relevant to our case?

09:55.186 --> 09:56.952
If you can find
our killer's stash,

09:56.954 --> 09:58.087
I can match it.

10:00.891 --> 10:02.658
Yeah, DiNozzo.
Go.

10:02.660 --> 10:03.660
Just got a call.

10:03.661 --> 10:05.327
Director Vance wants us
to meet him ASAP

10:05.329 --> 10:06.495
at the Pentagon.

10:06.497 --> 10:07.796
About what?

10:07.798 --> 10:09.731
He didn't say.

10:12.735 --> 10:15.070
I'm just as in the dark
as you are.

10:15.072 --> 10:16.638
SECNAV called,

10:16.640 --> 10:18.407
wanted to have a meeting
off the books,

10:18.409 --> 10:19.575
and here we are.

10:19.577 --> 10:20.909
In the basement.

10:20.911 --> 10:22.811
Don't they have secret war rooms
for meetings like this?

10:22.813 --> 10:24.179
And we're heading to one.

10:24.181 --> 10:27.316
And the, um, SECNAV
asked me to join?

10:27.318 --> 10:29.351
It's my idea, Agent DiNozzo.

10:29.353 --> 10:31.353
Need you to guard
the war room.

10:43.700 --> 10:44.900
How do you do it?

10:44.902 --> 10:46.201
It's like pigs at the trough.

10:46.203 --> 10:48.737
Eh, some places,
it really is a trough, ma'am.

10:48.739 --> 10:50.439
Fenway, Wrigley...

10:50.441 --> 10:52.107
Mm-hmm.
Mostly stadiums.

10:52.109 --> 10:53.308
Director Vance, Agent Gibbs,

10:53.310 --> 10:54.910
I apologize for the location.

10:54.912 --> 10:57.579
Well, like Gibbs said,
we've been to worse.

10:58.715 --> 11:01.316
You're investigating the
murder case of an NRL scientist.

11:01.318 --> 11:04.019
My office was contacted
by a foreign embassy

11:04.021 --> 11:06.188
claiming to have helpful Intel.

11:06.190 --> 11:08.891
Which embassy?

11:08.893 --> 11:11.693
I promised Secretary Kerry to
keep this meeting off the radar

11:11.695 --> 11:13.428
in order to protect everyone.

11:13.430 --> 11:17.099
Which embassy, Madam Secretary?

11:21.938 --> 11:23.939
All yours.

11:23.941 --> 11:25.941
Oh.
Yeah, no. I'm...

11:25.943 --> 11:27.176
No, thanks.

11:27.178 --> 11:30.746
So is that just
how you pick up women, then?

11:30.748 --> 11:32.314
You just wait outside the door?

11:32.316 --> 11:34.950
No, I'm waiting on a friend.

11:34.952 --> 11:38.120
Oh. My idea is better.

11:38.122 --> 11:40.122
Yeah. Yeah.

11:43.260 --> 11:45.227
S-So, you-you work down here?

11:45.229 --> 11:47.496
Mm...

11:49.766 --> 11:52.367
Counselor Pavlenko.

11:52.369 --> 11:55.404
NCIS Agent, uh...

11:56.839 --> 11:58.674
DiNozzo.
Of course.

11:58.676 --> 12:02.744
You are the one who led
the Fins onto Russian soil.

12:02.746 --> 12:04.146
Yeah, that's right.

12:04.148 --> 12:05.747
It was a rescue team, actually,

12:05.749 --> 12:09.384
because help didn't seem
to be coming from anybody else.

12:11.021 --> 12:13.222
In here, counselor.

12:19.495 --> 12:22.064
Was that the secretary
of the Navy?

12:25.535 --> 12:27.569
Agent Gibbs,

12:27.571 --> 12:29.571
I was

12:29.573 --> 12:32.441
relieved to learn
of your safe return

12:32.443 --> 12:34.443
after the helicopter accident.

12:34.445 --> 12:36.445
It was no accident.

12:36.447 --> 12:38.647
It was a missile.

12:38.649 --> 12:40.349
Which is not why
we're here today.

12:40.351 --> 12:42.251
Why <i>are</i> we here today?

12:42.253 --> 12:46.488
This time, it is our turn to go
through the proper channels

12:46.490 --> 12:48.790
and ask for help.

12:49.692 --> 12:51.059
Your help.

12:54.497 --> 12:56.398
Nelly Benin.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.233
Our victim's former lab partner.

12:58.235 --> 12:59.735
We're already looking into her.

12:59.737 --> 13:01.003
I can help.

13:01.005 --> 13:03.171
Benin was a valued asset

13:03.173 --> 13:05.173
of our scientific community.

13:05.175 --> 13:06.775
Was?

13:06.777 --> 13:08.510
Moscow has
reason to believe

13:08.512 --> 13:13.048
she is now in the employ
of terrorist Sergei Mishnev.

13:13.050 --> 13:15.183
The same man who you claim

13:15.185 --> 13:17.352
shot you down, Agent Gibbs.

13:17.354 --> 13:20.589
Benin's colleague.

13:20.591 --> 13:22.858
Found in his Moscow
flat two days ago.

13:22.860 --> 13:24.826
A sophisticated weapon.

13:24.828 --> 13:26.662
Same killer?

13:26.664 --> 13:28.196
Benin.

13:28.198 --> 13:31.500
She is here in Washington.

13:31.502 --> 13:32.901
Why?

13:34.070 --> 13:37.039
You want us
to find your missing scientist.

13:37.041 --> 13:38.206
Gibbs...

13:38.208 --> 13:41.576
It is all right,
Madam Secretary.

13:41.578 --> 13:45.447
Agent Gibbs has highlighted
the embarrassing truth.

13:45.449 --> 13:47.249
We are asking NCIS

13:47.251 --> 13:50.385
to find Benin and stop her

13:50.387 --> 13:52.954
by any means necessary.

13:52.956 --> 13:56.224
And in return,
you just want this kept quiet.

13:56.226 --> 13:57.793
Save face.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.829
Tell your embassy this matter
will have our full attention.

14:00.831 --> 14:02.631
And Justice has requested

14:02.633 --> 14:05.033
a Joint Terrorism
Task Force leader.

14:05.035 --> 14:07.736
FBI will be assisting
in the manhunt.

14:07.738 --> 14:10.672
<i>I knew</i>
<i>the cold war was heating up,</i>

14:10.674 --> 14:13.642
but meeting in the men's room
is downright sexy.

14:13.644 --> 14:15.410
You think?

14:15.412 --> 14:17.713
Well, it's... need to know.

14:18.815 --> 14:20.782
I didn't catch your name.

14:20.784 --> 14:22.918
I didn't throw it.

14:22.920 --> 14:25.520
Mm. Maybe you could
write it down for me, then,

14:25.522 --> 14:28.490
right next to your...
little phone number.

14:28.492 --> 14:30.058
Mm.

14:32.295 --> 14:34.296
Director Vance,

14:34.298 --> 14:36.932
Special Agent Gibbs
and DiNozzo,

14:36.934 --> 14:39.634
I'd like you to meet
FBI Special Agent Pendergast.

14:41.170 --> 14:42.604
She will be your partner

14:42.606 --> 14:44.473
for the duration
of this case.

14:44.475 --> 14:46.808
Pleased to meet you.

14:48.478 --> 14:51.346
Oh. Okay.

15:02.287 --> 15:04.155
Now, why are we having
a meeting in here?

15:04.157 --> 15:06.591
Ask Agent Pendergast.

15:06.593 --> 15:07.959
I did a quick check.

15:07.961 --> 15:09.894
She's a former
Deputy U.S. Marshal

15:09.896 --> 15:12.330
turned Joint Terrorism
Task Force leader.

15:12.332 --> 15:13.898
An FBI manhunter.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.900
And I always
catch my prey.

15:16.768 --> 15:19.137
Got a question, Gumby?

15:19.972 --> 15:21.038
Sorry.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.273
I won't be good with names.

15:22.275 --> 15:23.808
Um, my name is McGee.

15:23.810 --> 15:26.244
I'm wondering why we're having
this meeting in MTAC.

15:26.246 --> 15:28.079
It's a secure briefing.

15:28.081 --> 15:31.082
We usually just brief
in the squad room... ma'am.

15:31.084 --> 15:32.116
Call me Leia.

15:32.118 --> 15:33.351
Like the princess.

15:33.353 --> 15:35.553
I hate <i>Star Wars.</i>

15:35.555 --> 15:37.355
Nobody hates <i>Star Wars.</i>

15:37.357 --> 15:39.624
You do when you're named Leia,
Agent DiNozzo.

15:39.626 --> 15:41.659
Hmm.
Yet you know his name.

15:41.661 --> 15:43.261
We met earlier.

15:45.331 --> 15:47.231
Okay.

15:48.233 --> 15:50.101
Nelly Benin.
Russian scientist.

15:50.103 --> 15:52.770
Suspected of ties
to a Russian terror group,

15:52.772 --> 15:54.772
the murder
of a colleague in Moscow,

15:54.774 --> 15:56.674
and our Navy
Research Lab scientist

15:56.676 --> 15:58.109
last night here in D.C.

15:58.111 --> 16:00.311
Our target entered the U.S.
with her Russian passport

16:00.313 --> 16:01.779
before it was flagged

16:01.781 --> 16:03.814
by Interpol.
BOLO's already

16:03.816 --> 16:06.150
doing the rounds with LEOs
and transportation authorities.

16:06.152 --> 16:07.685
That it?

16:07.687 --> 16:10.121
I got handed this case
an hour ago.

16:10.123 --> 16:12.523
NCIS had a head start,
so let's see what you got,

16:12.525 --> 16:14.458
kick down some doors
and find our killer.

16:14.460 --> 16:17.628
Come on. I showed you mine.
Show me yours.

16:19.932 --> 16:21.666
Tell her.

16:21.668 --> 16:24.635
We've already done
some digging on Benin.

16:24.637 --> 16:26.537
And?
And

16:26.539 --> 16:28.172
none of it makes any sense.

16:28.174 --> 16:30.341
Up until the suspected murder
two days ago,

16:30.343 --> 16:31.809
she was a model Russian citizen.

16:31.811 --> 16:33.844
Only thing on her record
is a ticket

16:33.846 --> 16:35.313
for streaking
at the Sochi Olympics.

16:35.315 --> 16:36.581
It's pretty ballsy,

16:36.583 --> 16:38.950
but hardly a precursor
to terrorism and murder.

16:38.952 --> 16:40.885
Russian Intel is...

16:40.887 --> 16:42.853
Really difficult to verify.

16:42.855 --> 16:44.355
That's putting it nicely.

16:44.357 --> 16:47.024
Sir, I understand
your hesitation,

16:47.026 --> 16:49.894
but Benin is our best
and only suspect in this murder,

16:49.896 --> 16:52.063
and our orders are
to hunt her down.

16:52.065 --> 16:55.199
A suspect, not prey.

16:55.201 --> 16:58.636
If half of what
I've heard about NCIS is true,

16:58.638 --> 17:01.839
you guys must have something
the FBI doesn't.

17:04.943 --> 17:06.210
Who are you,
what are you doing here,

17:06.212 --> 17:07.811
and who was the 27th
president of the United States?

17:07.814 --> 17:09.880
FBI Special Agent
Leia Pendergast,

17:09.882 --> 17:11.182
to catch a killer, Taft.

17:11.184 --> 17:12.983
No. Wait.

17:12.986 --> 17:14.919
Yes, you're right.

17:14.921 --> 17:17.221
But why would Gibbs
send you down here alone?

17:17.223 --> 17:18.656
He said we'd get along.

17:18.657 --> 17:20.258
Might have been
sarcasm, though.

17:20.260 --> 17:22.159
Well, he probably noticed that.

17:23.395 --> 17:25.396
Not a hunter?

17:25.397 --> 17:26.631
The opposite.

17:26.633 --> 17:28.531
You're a breeder, then?

17:28.534 --> 17:29.767
What?

17:29.769 --> 17:31.869
No.

17:31.871 --> 17:35.740
Um, I found a deleted e-mail
sent to our headless victim.

17:35.742 --> 17:38.175
It's from a junk account,
but it mentions

17:38.177 --> 17:40.878
a meeting at a bar
around the time of the murder.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.014
How did you get this?
Dr. Havana

17:43.016 --> 17:45.683
from the Navy Research Lab
turned over her hard drive.

17:45.685 --> 17:47.551
Liberty Square Bar is
on the other side

17:47.553 --> 17:49.387
of the park
where the body was found.

17:49.389 --> 17:52.123
Our victim was headed to this
meeting when she was attacked.

17:52.125 --> 17:53.691
Can you trace
the junk account?

17:53.693 --> 17:55.826
Already did.
There's no name,

17:55.828 --> 17:58.362
but it originated
in Moscow, Russia.

17:58.364 --> 18:00.631
Meaning our missing scientist
could have sent it.

18:00.633 --> 18:04.435
Benin lured her former
lab partner to her death.

18:04.437 --> 18:06.904
Yeah, looks that way.

18:06.906 --> 18:08.639
- I like her.
- Why?

18:08.641 --> 18:09.707
Because she winked at you?

18:09.709 --> 18:12.176
Talk about no boundaries.
Manhunter.

18:12.178 --> 18:14.545
I know, right?
I mean,

18:14.547 --> 18:17.348
she's only flirting with you
to get closer to her prey.

18:17.350 --> 18:19.450
The case.
She's using you.

18:19.452 --> 18:20.985
What do we got?

18:20.987 --> 18:22.386
A problem with the timeline.

18:22.388 --> 18:23.554
And airport security.

18:23.556 --> 18:24.855
Ugh. Here
we go again.

18:24.857 --> 18:27.391
Just 'cause your wee
little McGee shows up

18:27.393 --> 18:28.726
on the full
body scanner.

18:28.728 --> 18:30.428
Hey, it's an
invasion of privacy.

18:30.430 --> 18:32.830
But that's not
what I'm talking about here.

18:32.832 --> 18:34.665
There was an unrelated security
delay at Dulles last night.

18:34.667 --> 18:36.634
Something the Russians

18:36.636 --> 18:37.835
couldn't
have known about.

18:37.837 --> 18:39.470
While the attack

18:39.472 --> 18:40.938
was happening
in the park,

18:40.940 --> 18:42.440
Benin was stuck
at the terminal.

18:42.442 --> 18:44.108
She couldn't have
killed Glazman.

18:44.110 --> 18:46.143
She's still our
only suspect.

18:46.145 --> 18:47.445
You sound like Leia.

18:51.149 --> 18:52.316
Our victim's getting a call

18:52.318 --> 18:54.452
on her cell phone
from the Liberty Square Bar.

18:54.454 --> 18:56.120
Same bar from the e-mail.

18:56.122 --> 18:57.355
Smells like a trap.

18:57.357 --> 18:58.989
Or could be something else.

19:00.258 --> 19:02.526
I'm listening.

19:02.528 --> 19:06.831
McGee and I have been working
on kind of a loose theory.

19:06.833 --> 19:07.998
Ish.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.500
What if Benin is running?

19:09.502 --> 19:11.001
The flight here,
the secret e-mail

19:11.003 --> 19:13.337
to our victim, and now we know
the Russian Intel is shoddy.

19:13.339 --> 19:14.772
What if she's trying to defect?

19:14.774 --> 19:15.973
The Russians
don't want

19:15.975 --> 19:17.641
their scientist
sharing state secrets.

19:17.643 --> 19:19.243
So they accuse her of murder?

19:19.245 --> 19:21.379
She didn't kill
our naval scientist,

19:21.381 --> 19:23.614
which means she probably
didn't kill the guy in Moscow.

19:23.616 --> 19:25.416
And if she knows
we're monitoring

19:25.418 --> 19:28.219
Glazman's cell, that call
could be her reaching out.

19:28.221 --> 19:31.055
And if she's strapped to a bomb
waiting for us to show up?

19:31.057 --> 19:32.556
It was just a theory.

19:32.558 --> 19:35.526
We don't even know
what's going on yet.

19:35.528 --> 19:37.194
We are going to the bar anyway,

19:37.196 --> 19:38.629
and we're gonna
find out.

19:38.631 --> 19:40.464
And we're gonna start
by asking nicely.

19:40.466 --> 19:42.066
Am I updating the FBI?

19:42.068 --> 19:43.701
No. No, not yet.

19:43.703 --> 19:45.703
Got it.

19:45.705 --> 19:46.971
Uh, if Leia asks?

19:46.973 --> 19:49.373
Geez, DiNozzo,
make something up.

19:49.375 --> 19:50.808
She's your girlfriend.

19:52.578 --> 19:53.911
Why? Did she say something?

19:53.913 --> 19:56.247
Did she mention me by name?

20:03.021 --> 20:04.488
It's a popular place.

20:04.490 --> 20:05.823
Yeah. Looks like

20:05.825 --> 20:07.925
Barry's having a good time.

20:07.927 --> 20:09.827
Think our Russian joined
the <i>mishegoss?</i>

20:09.829 --> 20:12.329
At the bar, McGee.
Your one o'clock.

20:13.932 --> 20:17.268
She's drinking.
That good or bad?

20:17.270 --> 20:19.236
Time to test your theory.

20:19.238 --> 20:22.606
Hey, happy Bar
Mitzvah, Barry.

20:32.751 --> 20:35.219
So, is that
vodka or water?

20:35.221 --> 20:37.455
Gin.

20:37.457 --> 20:39.957
And I'm waiting for someone.

20:39.959 --> 20:44.261
I'm only asking 'cause it
would say a lot about you,

20:44.263 --> 20:46.530
your plans for the evening.

20:46.532 --> 20:49.667
My plans?
Who are you?

20:49.669 --> 20:52.536
See, I'd be worried if that
glass was filled with water.

20:52.538 --> 20:54.371
It would tell me
you don't want

20:54.373 --> 20:56.040
to lose control
of your faculties,

20:56.042 --> 20:58.576
or your nerve.

20:58.578 --> 21:03.214
If you're planning on
doing something bad.

21:05.050 --> 21:07.551
So, if I said this was water,

21:07.553 --> 21:09.954
you would think I'm dangerous?

21:09.956 --> 21:11.856
Killer, perhaps?

21:11.858 --> 21:15.359
Yeah, but I don't
think you are.

21:19.030 --> 21:21.232
Well, maybe you're wrong.

21:22.767 --> 21:24.268
Insurance.

21:25.370 --> 21:28.205
In case I don't like
what you have to offer.

21:28.207 --> 21:31.041
So choose your next
words carefully.

21:34.279 --> 21:36.780
If you're looking to
defect, we can help.

21:38.950 --> 21:41.886
Then why didn't you just say so?

21:45.323 --> 21:46.991
Everything all right,
McGee?

21:46.993 --> 21:48.759
Yeah, I think
so, boss.

21:48.761 --> 21:51.795
No, everything is far from okay.

21:51.797 --> 21:53.831
But it's a start.

21:53.833 --> 21:55.566
My name is Nelly Benin,

21:55.568 --> 21:57.868
and I'm seeking asylum
in the United States.

21:57.870 --> 22:00.237
Gibbs. NCIS.

22:00.239 --> 22:02.172
Why don't we get you
out of here?

22:02.174 --> 22:04.241
Okay, fine,
but let's two things straight.

22:04.243 --> 22:06.443
I didn't kill anybody.

22:07.779 --> 22:10.281
And... I have to pee.

22:10.283 --> 22:12.883
Wait. What about
that bomb?

22:12.885 --> 22:15.119
There isn't one.

22:15.121 --> 22:17.521
Just pulled out the insides
of an old calculator.

22:18.523 --> 22:21.325
I got this.

22:28.667 --> 22:30.301
So, that, of course,
was accounting.

22:30.303 --> 22:32.102
The big abacus gave
it away.

22:32.104 --> 22:33.637
And here's the wall.

22:33.639 --> 22:36.740
Ah, the wall has seen
a lot of action lately.

22:36.742 --> 22:38.442
Sergei Mishnev
is your number one?

22:38.444 --> 22:40.377
That's odd.
You must want him pretty bad.

22:40.379 --> 22:42.446
Don't question wall.

22:43.949 --> 22:46.250
Your team has desks in here?

22:46.252 --> 22:47.985
Oh, God.

22:47.987 --> 22:50.120
The big orange room?
That'd give me a headache. No.

22:50.122 --> 22:52.122
We're in the Stephen
J. Cannell annex.

22:52.124 --> 22:54.425
I watched <i>The A-Team.</i>

22:54.427 --> 22:55.659
Pardon me?

22:55.661 --> 22:56.927
And <i>Rockford</i>

22:56.929 --> 22:58.562
and <i>The Greatest American Hero,</i>
mm-hmm.

22:58.564 --> 22:59.964
Really?
Mm.

22:59.966 --> 23:01.865
You found her, didn't you?

23:01.867 --> 23:03.300
I'm sorry. Who?

23:04.637 --> 23:06.604
And this was going so well.

23:06.606 --> 23:08.205
The tour?

23:09.475 --> 23:11.775
Yet you-you continue
selling me bull?

23:11.777 --> 23:13.243
<i>Hardcastle and McCormick.</i>

23:13.245 --> 23:14.745
Underrated
Cannell classic.

23:14.747 --> 23:16.113
<i>21 Jump Street--</i>

23:16.115 --> 23:19.049
kind of fascist and
weird, but I'm into it.

23:21.686 --> 23:24.054
Sorry.

23:25.290 --> 23:29.126
Not used to playing
the tough guy.

23:29.128 --> 23:31.762
But you still think
I'm dangerous.

23:31.764 --> 23:33.664
Well, your bluff was
a little too good.

23:33.666 --> 23:37.735
I didn't find out my friend
was dead until I got here.

23:39.972 --> 23:42.373
Things are going
so well today.

23:49.581 --> 23:51.882
There. All better.

23:56.588 --> 23:58.222
Geez. Come on!

23:58.224 --> 24:00.524
Let's go.

24:01.559 --> 24:03.360
Pardon.

24:06.965 --> 24:09.099
Something wrong?
Marijuana.

24:36.879 --> 24:39.614
This proves I had nothing
to do with the murders.

24:39.616 --> 24:41.950
Well, that depends.

24:41.952 --> 24:44.386
I don't know who that woman was,

24:44.388 --> 24:46.755
but I know
who she's working for.

24:46.757 --> 24:48.824
Sergei Mishnev.

24:48.826 --> 24:50.992
Leader of a rogue
military group in Russia.

24:50.994 --> 24:52.828
Yeah. Yeah, I know who he is.

24:52.830 --> 24:56.364
Well, I didn't,
not until last week

24:56.366 --> 24:59.100
when he approached me
in a café outside my apartment.

25:02.772 --> 25:05.640
That's him.
He knew I was working

25:05.642 --> 25:07.409
for the government lab,
but he wanted me

25:07.411 --> 25:08.944
to join him in a private sector.

25:08.946 --> 25:11.112
Hmm. Doing what?

25:11.114 --> 25:13.081
He refused to say.

25:13.083 --> 25:15.984
That's how I knew
it wasn't a normal job offer.

25:15.986 --> 25:18.753
So, I politely
turned him down.

25:18.755 --> 25:22.090
You <i>are</i> going
to help me after this?

25:22.092 --> 25:24.359
Let me stay in the U.S.?

25:32.935 --> 25:35.403
Mikhail.

25:37.073 --> 25:39.307
A coworker.

25:39.309 --> 25:40.709
I told him about the job,

25:40.711 --> 25:42.644
and he said
he'd received the same offer

25:42.646 --> 25:46.214
by the same man...
on the same day.

25:48.851 --> 25:50.785
Yeah, well,

25:50.787 --> 25:53.588
you both turned him down.

25:53.590 --> 25:55.390
The next morning, I got a call

25:55.392 --> 25:57.392
that Mikhail
had been murdered,

25:57.394 --> 25:59.794
and unless I took the job,
I was next.

26:01.330 --> 26:03.899
When do I talk to your consulate
about formal naturalization?

26:03.901 --> 26:06.601
Yeah, murder suspects
don't get citizenship.

26:06.603 --> 26:08.136
I'm not a killer!

26:08.138 --> 26:10.906
Then finish the story.

26:13.277 --> 26:16.811
Sofia and I had been competing
on the same laser research.

26:16.813 --> 26:19.648
But she was the only one
I could turn to.

26:19.650 --> 26:22.050
It never occurred to me

26:22.052 --> 26:24.653
that they would find out
and go after her, too.

26:24.655 --> 26:26.054
Sergei and his group

26:26.056 --> 26:28.456
want me dead because
I refused to work for them.

26:28.458 --> 26:31.192
Russia has police.

26:31.194 --> 26:33.295
Sergei said it would do no good.

26:33.297 --> 26:36.264
He said he had many friends.

26:36.266 --> 26:38.400
That's a big jump

26:38.402 --> 26:41.436
from murder suspect
to innocent victim.

26:41.438 --> 26:45.106
The fact that I had anything
to do with this is a lie!

26:48.311 --> 26:50.946
Who told you
I murdered my friends?

26:52.348 --> 26:53.815
I know you have our scientist.

26:53.817 --> 26:55.850
Nice to see you, too.

26:57.020 --> 26:59.354
Madam Secretary.

26:59.356 --> 27:01.323
I miss anything?

27:01.325 --> 27:03.458
The Russians
calling us liars.

27:03.460 --> 27:05.694
So the usual, then?

27:05.696 --> 27:07.562
Very good,

27:07.564 --> 27:10.298
but I know you've had Miss Benin
in custody for hours.

27:10.300 --> 27:11.900
Call it intuition.

27:11.902 --> 27:13.368
I hope it's not
the same intuition

27:13.370 --> 27:16.004
that told you that
Nelly Benin is our killer,

27:16.006 --> 27:17.806
because she's not.

27:17.808 --> 27:19.674
Now you're calling <i>me</i> a liar.

27:19.676 --> 27:21.142
The usual.

27:21.144 --> 27:23.912
You gave us bad Intel,
Bad Anton.

27:23.914 --> 27:25.847
I know.

27:25.849 --> 27:28.350
Moscow doesn't always
tell me everything,

27:28.352 --> 27:30.652
which can put me
in an awkward position.

27:30.654 --> 27:32.487
So why the
secret meetings?

27:32.489 --> 27:34.456
The urgent
manhunt?

27:34.458 --> 27:37.359
I believe you call it
"better safe than sorry."

27:37.361 --> 27:38.860
Hmm.

27:38.862 --> 27:42.230
But since she is no longer a
murder suspect, all the better.

27:43.632 --> 27:45.867
We have a government plane
waiting at Dulles

27:45.869 --> 27:48.670
for our safe
and immediate return.

27:50.106 --> 27:52.407
Well, that's assuming
that we have her.

27:52.409 --> 27:56.044
Madam Secretary, I do not think

27:56.046 --> 27:58.013
you want to open
an international wound

27:58.015 --> 27:59.614
over a scientist.

27:59.616 --> 28:01.950
<i>You</i> did.

28:01.952 --> 28:04.085
I will tell Moscow

28:04.087 --> 28:06.888
we have your absolute
cooperation.

28:16.199 --> 28:17.732
Ass.

28:17.734 --> 28:19.300
But he's right, Leon.

28:19.302 --> 28:22.203
We can't spend
political capital here.

28:22.205 --> 28:24.105
I... I was just sitting down
to write a note,

28:24.107 --> 28:25.340
and then Pavlenko walked in.

28:25.342 --> 28:28.076
No. You sit wherever you like.

28:29.178 --> 28:30.678
I want to know how the hell

28:30.680 --> 28:33.048
the Russians found out
we had Benin.

28:34.418 --> 28:35.617
Get me Agent Gibbs.

28:35.619 --> 28:37.419
Certainly. Hold on, please.

28:37.421 --> 28:38.720
Hey.

28:38.722 --> 28:40.855
I knew you found Benin.

28:40.857 --> 28:42.957
Couldn't talk to you until we
talked to her. You understand.

28:42.959 --> 28:44.059
No, I don't.

28:44.061 --> 28:45.560
Hey, we missed this room
on the tour.

28:45.562 --> 28:46.761
Check it out.

28:46.763 --> 28:49.230
No more tours, no more lies.

28:49.232 --> 28:50.799
Well, have a seat.

28:50.801 --> 28:52.267
Let's talk about it.

28:52.269 --> 28:55.003
If you killed me
right here, right now,

28:55.005 --> 28:57.906
my dead body would refuse
to sit at that table.

28:57.908 --> 29:00.909
Did you tell the Russians
we had Benin?

29:00.911 --> 29:02.477
Treason?

29:02.479 --> 29:05.146
Ah. <i>Light</i> treason.

29:05.148 --> 29:06.981
We've done some digging.

29:06.983 --> 29:09.050
You've been assigned to protect
three Russian emissaries

29:09.052 --> 29:10.852
in the last three months.

29:10.854 --> 29:13.221
And, in fact,
the Russian embassy specifically

29:13.223 --> 29:15.723
requested your assignment
to this case.

29:15.725 --> 29:18.393
Treason.
For hire.

29:20.329 --> 29:23.031
$28,000 was deposited
in your

29:23.033 --> 29:24.966
bank account
at the beginning of the month

29:24.968 --> 29:26.401
from an offshore account.

29:26.403 --> 29:28.770
I could kill you.

29:28.772 --> 29:30.472
Then it'd be treason and murder.

29:31.307 --> 29:33.641
You've lied to me,

29:33.643 --> 29:36.211
and you've made accusations,
but now you're wasting my time.

29:36.213 --> 29:37.779
I'm not your leak.

29:37.781 --> 29:39.747
I believe you.

29:39.749 --> 29:43.351
So tell us who sent the money,
and everyone else can.

29:43.353 --> 29:46.020
Go ahead, trace the account.

29:46.022 --> 29:47.822
Now who's wasting time?

29:47.824 --> 29:49.657
Belongs to my father.

29:49.659 --> 29:52.227
Your father has Russian ties?
No.

29:52.229 --> 29:54.762
I can't believe you.

29:54.764 --> 29:56.998
I'm trying to believe you.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.767
My father has money.

29:59.769 --> 30:01.102
A lot of it.

30:01.104 --> 30:03.438
He didn't come into it
till after I was 17.

30:03.440 --> 30:05.573
But now he sends me
$28,000 every year.

30:05.575 --> 30:07.976
Not because I want it,
or because I need it.

30:07.978 --> 30:12.147
Just because it's, uh...
some kind of tax benefit.

30:13.516 --> 30:16.451
Our relationship
has always been a little, um...

30:16.453 --> 30:18.186
Challenging.

30:19.121 --> 30:21.156
What would you know about it?

30:21.158 --> 30:24.292
Well, it's a long story.

30:24.294 --> 30:27.061
Well, then, we should skip it,
because I have a job to do,

30:27.063 --> 30:29.531
and our Russian scientist
has a flight to make.

30:29.533 --> 30:33.368
And you have prey
to catch.

30:33.370 --> 30:34.969
Always do.

30:34.971 --> 30:37.405
Except this one wasn't running
from you,

30:37.407 --> 30:40.141
and she's still being hunted.

30:44.346 --> 30:46.447
<i>This group wants me dead,</i>

30:46.449 --> 30:48.216
and you're sending me back?

30:48.218 --> 30:49.984
Sergei will find me.

30:49.986 --> 30:51.419
Clearly, my government
doesn't care about stopping him.

30:51.421 --> 30:52.720
Unfortunately,

30:52.722 --> 30:54.656
your government has made a lot
of things clear, Miss Benin.

30:54.658 --> 30:56.691
No. The United States
grants asylum

30:56.693 --> 30:57.825
to political refugees

30:57.827 --> 30:59.060
and those fleeing
religious persecution.

30:59.062 --> 31:01.462
How is this
any different?

31:01.464 --> 31:03.131
I'm sorry.

31:04.567 --> 31:07.268
Please. I have value.

31:25.355 --> 31:27.455
Am I too late?

31:28.525 --> 31:29.557
For what?

31:29.559 --> 31:30.658
We identified our killer.

31:30.660 --> 31:32.060
Using your description
from the bar,

31:32.062 --> 31:33.661
I got a hit on
our hit woman.

31:33.663 --> 31:35.096
Renata Atal.

31:35.098 --> 31:37.065
Russian expat wanted
in connection

31:37.067 --> 31:38.566
with multiple murder-for-hires

31:38.568 --> 31:40.268
involving unusual weapons.

31:40.270 --> 31:42.737
A motorized garrote
would qualify.

31:42.739 --> 31:44.906
I already put out the BOLO.
We know who's after Benin.

31:44.908 --> 31:46.908
Which means we can get her back
to protect her.

31:46.910 --> 31:48.543
No, we can't.

31:49.211 --> 31:50.745
DiNozzo and McGee get this?

31:50.747 --> 31:51.946
They weren't in the bullpen.

31:51.948 --> 31:53.214
Get it to their cell phone now.

31:53.216 --> 31:55.083
Okay. Uh, why?

31:57.354 --> 31:59.988
Let me go to your news media.

31:59.990 --> 32:02.557
If I cannot win your sympathy,
then-then maybe...

32:02.559 --> 32:04.592
I get it, okay?

32:04.594 --> 32:06.761
You'll help me?

32:06.763 --> 32:08.596
No.

32:08.598 --> 32:10.431
You're not worth
starting a war over,

32:10.433 --> 32:13.568
but like I said, I get it.

32:16.272 --> 32:19.674
Thank you for that, at least.

32:52.875 --> 32:54.842
<i>Why are we in here?</i>

32:54.844 --> 32:56.010
What's happening?

32:57.247 --> 32:58.646
Hello.

32:58.648 --> 33:00.014
Stay in the car.

33:00.016 --> 33:01.516
Tony, I think we're
being followed.

33:01.518 --> 33:02.717
You are.

33:02.719 --> 33:04.252
What? Where-where are you?

33:04.254 --> 33:05.687
Following you.

33:05.689 --> 33:07.622
And our hit woman now.

33:07.624 --> 33:08.690
What? The whole time?

33:08.692 --> 33:09.757
Yeah, I had a hunch.

33:09.759 --> 33:11.292
Now, stay in the car, Leia.

33:11.294 --> 33:12.660
Tony, what are you gonna do?

33:12.662 --> 33:13.795
Well...

33:13.797 --> 33:15.496
He hung up?

33:15.498 --> 33:17.398
Uh, what do we do now?

33:17.400 --> 33:19.300
Get down.

34:01.177 --> 34:02.177
Turn off the engine.

34:02.178 --> 34:03.578
Hands on the wheel!

34:08.117 --> 34:09.784
It's over.

34:13.956 --> 34:15.289
I know.

34:17.359 --> 34:18.993
Hey, hands on the wheel! No! No!

34:18.995 --> 34:21.094
No, no, no, no, no, stop!

34:27.202 --> 34:30.304
How did this woman know
I was being transferred?

34:44.257 --> 34:45.991
First you refuse
to grant me asylum.

34:45.993 --> 34:49.628
Then you use me as bait to lure
my assassin out into the open.

34:49.630 --> 34:50.728
And now you still plan

34:50.731 --> 34:52.297
on turning me in to
those responsible?

34:52.299 --> 34:53.998
We don't have proof.

34:54.001 --> 34:56.534
Outside of this building,
Counselor Pavlenko was

34:56.536 --> 34:58.604
the only one who knew
I was being transferred.

34:58.606 --> 35:01.306
It does appear someone
tipped off the hit woman.

35:01.308 --> 35:02.808
Yeah, and it still wasn't me.

35:02.810 --> 35:04.843
I ask about treason one time.

35:04.845 --> 35:05.845
Enough!

35:07.013 --> 35:09.481
What do we got?

35:09.483 --> 35:10.749
Well, dwindling shot clock.

35:10.751 --> 35:12.718
The Russians are expecting
their scientist back.

35:12.720 --> 35:14.620
I would rather die
than be looking over my shoulder

35:14.622 --> 35:15.721
for the rest of my life.

35:15.723 --> 35:17.456
We still don't have
enough evidence

35:17.458 --> 35:20.525
to connect Pavlenko to the
rogue Russians or to Mishnev.

35:23.863 --> 35:25.464
Body.

35:25.466 --> 35:26.531
Headless hit woman's with Ducky.

35:26.533 --> 35:28.000
And her SUV is down
in the garage.

35:28.002 --> 35:29.968
Abby's on it, but no word yet.

35:29.970 --> 35:33.305
Then you don't know
what we've got.

35:33.307 --> 35:34.873
Well, I...

35:34.875 --> 35:36.274
DiNozzo.

35:36.276 --> 35:37.576
I need Gibbs.

35:37.578 --> 35:39.411
Oh. Uh, yes.
Director, hold on.

35:39.413 --> 35:41.446
Uh, it's Director Vance.
He's looking for you, boss.

35:41.448 --> 35:42.814
Yeah, I'll bet he is.

35:42.816 --> 35:45.017
You know,
he's not here right now.

35:45.019 --> 35:46.718
I could ta...

35:46.720 --> 35:48.186
Hello? He hung up.

35:48.188 --> 35:49.554
Oh, can't imagine.

35:49.556 --> 35:50.989
Excuse me?

35:50.991 --> 35:53.925
Pendergast! With me!

35:55.895 --> 36:00.132
The Berserkers of Old Norse
literature were known

36:00.134 --> 36:03.602
for fighting in a bloodthirsty
and trancelike state.

36:03.604 --> 36:06.204
Hence, the term "going berserk""

36:06.206 --> 36:08.440
Yeah. One theory suggests

36:08.442 --> 36:12.277
that it was the ingestion
of a hallucinogenic mushroom,

36:12.279 --> 36:14.446
the <i>Amanita muscaria,</i>

36:14.448 --> 36:18.383
that made these warriors lose
their heads, so to speak.

36:18.385 --> 36:20.852
That's not what made
our killer lose hers.

36:20.854 --> 36:22.788
And Miss Atal
preferred dope.

36:22.790 --> 36:26.591
Uh, we used to call it
"Mary Jane," Miss, uh...?

36:26.593 --> 36:28.627
Leia. FBI.

36:28.629 --> 36:30.028
Ah.

36:30.030 --> 36:32.330
Oh, well, uh,
her body reeked of the drug,

36:32.332 --> 36:34.833
so she wasn't
in a berserk fury.

36:34.835 --> 36:36.935
She would find herself relaxed

36:36.937 --> 36:40.739
and mildly euphoric
as she killed others.

36:40.741 --> 36:42.874
Doubt her own death
felt very good.

36:42.876 --> 36:45.911
Well, facing a lifetime
of prison, suicide was

36:45.913 --> 36:47.512
no doubt preferable,

36:47.514 --> 36:50.315
and it would have prevented her
from being questioned.

36:50.317 --> 36:51.783
Duck, tell me you got something.

36:51.785 --> 36:53.251
Well, plenty of something

36:53.253 --> 36:55.353
to suggest that she killed
our Navy scientist.

36:55.355 --> 36:57.355
The-the murder weapon,

36:57.357 --> 36:58.824
the similar markings
on the neck.

36:58.826 --> 37:01.126
We need her employer.
Well, that's something

37:01.128 --> 37:03.128
that the body did not provide.

37:03.130 --> 37:05.464
Gibbs!
Abbs.

37:05.466 --> 37:06.832
You.

37:07.500 --> 37:08.967
Abby.
Um, I processed

37:08.969 --> 37:10.535
the weed residue
on our third garrote.

37:10.537 --> 37:11.970
It matches the first two.

37:11.972 --> 37:13.171
Definitely our killer.

37:13.173 --> 37:14.473
We know. The SUV?

37:14.475 --> 37:17.209
Still processing that,
but so far, nada, zilch.

37:17.211 --> 37:19.377
But before you ask,
I ran deep background

37:19.379 --> 37:22.214
on both Renata Atal
and Anton Pavlenko.

37:22.216 --> 37:23.415
What's the connection?

37:23.417 --> 37:25.984
Our hit woman was a pro,
Gibbs, so,

37:25.986 --> 37:28.019
if Pavlenko is
connected to her...

37:28.021 --> 37:29.187
He's no dummy, either.

37:29.189 --> 37:31.256
We just need more time.

37:31.258 --> 37:32.924
Time's up, Agent Gibbs.

37:32.926 --> 37:36.328
And there's nothing
we can do to delay this further.

37:37.597 --> 37:40.599
We have our, um...
we have our murderer.

37:42.502 --> 37:45.103
It's time to give the Russians
what they want.

37:50.511 --> 37:51.977
Ah.

37:51.979 --> 37:54.579
Came yourself this time, Anton.

37:54.581 --> 37:57.749
My people are waiting
with the plane.

37:57.751 --> 37:59.951
I was hoping
we could talk.

37:59.953 --> 38:01.920
Right.

38:01.922 --> 38:04.856
You tell Sergei I said howdy.

38:04.858 --> 38:07.459
What would make you think
he and I are friendly?

38:07.461 --> 38:09.528
You lied.

38:09.530 --> 38:11.696
You're lying right now.

38:11.698 --> 38:13.799
If I motivated you

38:13.801 --> 38:16.067
to find Benin faster,
then it was worth it,

38:16.069 --> 38:18.236
so you could protect her,
prevent escalation,

38:18.238 --> 38:20.205
war, even.

38:20.207 --> 38:21.606
We're already fighting one.

38:21.608 --> 38:23.675
Yes, and we are
on the same side.

38:23.677 --> 38:25.610
Against Sergei.

38:25.612 --> 38:29.781
Look, I had nothing to
do with those deaths.

38:29.783 --> 38:32.317
How can I prove that to you?

38:34.053 --> 38:37.122
Perhaps... next time?

38:37.124 --> 38:39.891
I know where to find you.

38:43.262 --> 38:46.231
No, no. No, I won't go.

38:46.233 --> 38:47.666
- Not with him.
- Take it easy,

38:47.668 --> 38:49.568
or you'll be flying
in handcuffs. Come on.

38:49.570 --> 38:52.671
I hope that will not be
necessary, Miss Benin.

38:52.673 --> 38:55.707
I give you my word,
we will return you home

38:55.709 --> 38:57.742
peacefully and safely.

38:57.744 --> 39:00.345
No. No. No!

39:05.451 --> 39:07.052
Don't do this.

39:08.221 --> 39:10.422
Stand down, DiNozzo.

39:13.860 --> 39:19.397
Agent Gibbs, do something.

39:30.244 --> 39:31.543
For God's sake,

39:31.545 --> 39:33.345
somebody do something!

39:41.721 --> 39:43.321
What did you do?

39:43.323 --> 39:46.124
My job.

39:52.598 --> 39:55.400
I guess Benin was dangerous
after all.

39:55.402 --> 39:57.335
But don't worry.

39:57.337 --> 39:59.638
I will tell Moscow the truth
when I get back.

39:59.640 --> 40:01.473
The truth?

40:01.475 --> 40:03.675
You're gonna tell the truth?

40:03.677 --> 40:06.478
That the Americans were
of great help,

40:06.480 --> 40:09.614
and that she is
no longer a threat

40:09.616 --> 40:12.017
or our concern.

40:15.154 --> 40:17.489
But it didn't have
to end like this,

40:17.491 --> 40:19.824
Gibbs.

40:35.309 --> 40:38.310
So, Pavlenko wanted her dead?

40:38.312 --> 40:40.111
This proves
he's behind the hit woman

40:40.113 --> 40:42.213
and part
of the Russian terrorist group.

40:42.215 --> 40:44.316
Yeah, maybe,
but with diplomatic immunity...

40:45.485 --> 40:47.819
Where's Gibbs?

40:49.289 --> 40:50.956
Right here,
Madam Secretary.

40:50.958 --> 40:52.257
Save the formality.

40:52.259 --> 40:54.526
How the hell did this happen
in our own house?!

40:54.528 --> 40:56.094
Thank you.

40:56.096 --> 40:57.829
That was base security.

40:57.831 --> 40:59.864
Pavlenko has left the Navy Yard.

41:01.534 --> 41:02.801
Gibbs?

41:06.639 --> 41:08.273
Madam Secretary.

41:09.275 --> 41:11.042
Oh, I usually used
glycerin to get out stains.

41:11.044 --> 41:13.478
Yeah, well, I have
some in Autopsy.

41:13.480 --> 41:15.080
Gibbs?

41:15.082 --> 41:18.249
You said give the Russians
what they want.

41:19.352 --> 41:21.987
We did.

41:26.759 --> 41:29.027
You had blanks in your gun?

41:29.029 --> 41:31.529
Hunter knows what weapon to use
to get the job done.

41:31.531 --> 41:33.331
And you and Gibbs
didn't tell me?

41:33.333 --> 41:35.066
It was my one condition
for going along

41:35.068 --> 41:36.234
with this whole crazy thing.

41:36.236 --> 41:37.535
I see.

41:37.537 --> 41:41.806
So... this isn't 'cause
I'm... better at my job?

41:41.808 --> 41:43.074
What?

41:43.076 --> 41:44.342
Yeah, you know,

41:44.344 --> 41:45.910
the stall tactics on you,

41:45.912 --> 41:47.912
following you
to get to the hit woman.

41:47.914 --> 41:49.914
Oh, and you think
that was because...

41:49.916 --> 41:51.916
Smarter. Me.

41:51.918 --> 41:54.819
What about the fact that I used
my contacts with the Russians

41:54.821 --> 41:56.087
to sell this whole damn thing?

41:56.089 --> 41:58.223
Dangerous. You.

41:58.225 --> 41:59.657
You're unbelievable.

41:59.659 --> 42:00.959
Thank you. Now,

42:00.961 --> 42:03.628
about getting that phone number
in writing.

42:03.630 --> 42:06.131
You're the detective, Tony.

42:09.068 --> 42:11.036
You know what "Tony" is
spelled backwards?

42:11.038 --> 42:12.737
Why not?

42:12.739 --> 42:16.074
Think about it.

42:16.076 --> 42:17.776
You overheard that.

42:17.778 --> 42:18.877
Didn't have a choice.

42:18.879 --> 42:21.012
Gibbs would never leave
you out of the loop

42:21.014 --> 42:22.180
on something like this.

42:22.182 --> 42:23.648
He didn't.

42:23.650 --> 42:26.284
You knew?
You were just...

42:27.520 --> 42:29.721
Wait. So, why bother
fighting with her?

42:29.723 --> 42:32.490
She fights back.

42:35.621 --> 42:37.654
I have a type.

42:38.624 --> 42:45.124
