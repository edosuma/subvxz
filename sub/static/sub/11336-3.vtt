WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.201
Look at me!

00:02.203 --> 00:03.669
You sold me out.
Sean,

00:03.671 --> 00:06.005
I didn't. I didn't.
Sean, Sean,

00:06.007 --> 00:07.240
listen to me.
listen to me.

00:07.241 --> 00:08.474
Just put the gun
down, okay?

00:08.475 --> 00:09.708
That's not gonna...
that's not gonna help!

00:09.710 --> 00:11.477
(mechanical whirring)

00:11.479 --> 00:12.711
Trouble.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.413
Geddes's moved.
He's in the line of fire.

00:14.415 --> 00:15.647
PARKER:
Hold. Hold.

00:15.649 --> 00:18.050
Give me Keenan's phone number.

00:18.052 --> 00:19.218
Your guys are at the door,
get him out!

00:19.220 --> 00:20.219
Team, I'm gonna

00:20.221 --> 00:21.353
start talking. Jules,

00:21.355 --> 00:23.055
you're my secondary.
<i> Sean,</i>

00:23.057 --> 00:24.256
you don't want to do this, man.

00:24.258 --> 00:25.290
Okay?

00:25.292 --> 00:27.092
I invest in you.
Look...

00:27.094 --> 00:29.161
let's think this through, okay?
And you spit on all that

00:29.163 --> 00:30.229
to make yourself a deal?

00:30.231 --> 00:32.031
It couldn't be
Jacks, okay?

00:32.033 --> 00:33.298
Just leave the kid alone.

00:37.271 --> 00:39.505
You had a future.

00:39.507 --> 00:40.473
Don't do it.

00:40.474 --> 00:41.440
One more word.

00:42.676 --> 00:43.809
Sean, please.

00:43.811 --> 00:46.278
I trusted you.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.047
What does that mean?

01:04.065 --> 01:06.098
(under breath):
Here you go.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.133
Milk-delivery
guy show?

01:08.135 --> 01:09.802
Uh, yeah.

01:09.804 --> 01:11.804
Half an hour ago.
Awesome!

01:11.806 --> 01:13.105
It's so great
how shipments

01:13.107 --> 01:14.440
arrive in time for my shift.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.141
Yeah, well, it's done.

01:16.143 --> 01:18.677
Uh, soy milk,
whole, fat-free.

01:18.679 --> 01:21.146
Sugar packs are refilled
and stix.

01:21.148 --> 01:22.648
My hero.

01:24.085 --> 01:25.617
You got a date?

01:25.619 --> 01:28.320
Uh, yeah.

01:28.322 --> 01:30.089
Really.

01:30.091 --> 01:31.790
You didn't go

01:31.792 --> 01:33.459
with flowers.
No, they don't

01:33.461 --> 01:35.227
play so well
with the four year olds.

01:35.229 --> 01:36.528
Oh.

01:36.530 --> 01:39.131
(chuckles)

01:39.133 --> 01:42.134
So... see you tomorrow.

01:42.136 --> 01:43.869
Julia, what are
you doing after?

01:43.871 --> 01:45.704
I dunno.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.706
Um...

01:47.708 --> 01:50.242
maybe I'll swing by later.

01:50.244 --> 01:52.211
Okay.

01:53.180 --> 01:55.180
Okay.

01:55.182 --> 01:56.715
Um, well, see ya.

02:02.723 --> 02:04.723
Hey, Ed.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.792
Got your new
mug shot.
Thanks, Sally.

02:09.730 --> 02:11.463
(whistling)

02:13.434 --> 02:15.434
Warrant?

02:15.436 --> 02:17.336
Not yet. New mug shot.

02:17.338 --> 02:19.204
WORDY:
We're sure he's going
to be alone, right?

02:19.206 --> 02:20.439
We do not proceed
unless he is.

02:20.441 --> 02:21.473
And when we do,

02:21.475 --> 02:22.841
it's a no-knock deal.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.810
It's all about the first
three seconds of engagement.

02:24.812 --> 02:25.911
We lose the element
of surprise--

02:25.913 --> 02:27.146
whole new rulebook.

02:27.148 --> 02:28.881
Who's their inside man?

02:28.883 --> 02:29.915
Naismith isn't saying.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.450
But they've had a narcotics cop

02:31.452 --> 02:32.818
deep undercover
for eight months.

02:32.820 --> 02:33.852
And today is Christmas.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.587
And it's
a record-breaking score.

02:35.589 --> 02:37.256
Brief little window
of opportunity

02:37.258 --> 02:38.357
before it disappears
on the street.

02:38.359 --> 02:39.758
Eight months of prep.
And they get

02:39.760 --> 02:41.527
to watch us fly in
for the grand finale.

02:41.529 --> 02:43.529
Well.
You ain't got the guts!

02:43.531 --> 02:45.631
That's why we get
the cool pants.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.332
That's what I'm saying.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.500
WOMAN (over PA):
Practice area reset.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.302
We're a go for round five.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.503
All right, guys,
one more time.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.238
Practice makes
perfect.

02:54.808 --> 02:55.807
Ready, Sam?

02:55.809 --> 02:57.643
I've cleared
bad guys before.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.645
It's serving a warrant
for the search

02:59.647 --> 03:01.664
of the gentleman's premises

03:01.665 --> 03:03.682
for the highly-corroborated
presence of narcotics.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.717
Speed, surprise
and aggressive action.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.719
Hey, so what
about tonight?

03:07.721 --> 03:09.388
Not going to happen.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.423
It's going to be a long day,
you're going to be hungry.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.425
Dinner's a very
important meal.
Sam...

03:13.427 --> 03:14.860
A burrito, and a couple
of beers--

03:14.862 --> 03:16.529
what's the big deal?

03:16.530 --> 03:18.197
All right, you know, I'm not
trying to flatter myself.

03:18.199 --> 03:19.398
I know you're
just being nice,

03:19.400 --> 03:21.433
I don't want to
read into this.

03:21.435 --> 03:22.901
I've just worked
way too hard

03:22.903 --> 03:25.237
to be here, to screw it
up by getting personal.

03:25.239 --> 03:26.705
It's not worth it.

03:26.707 --> 03:29.241
There's like 500 cops waiting
to get in the SRU,

03:29.243 --> 03:31.243
500<i> guys</i> waiting

03:31.245 --> 03:33.212
for me to do something
that I shouldn't.

03:33.214 --> 03:35.214
So, I'm sorry.

03:35.216 --> 03:36.615
But the team comes first.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.650
Jules, it was
just a burrito.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.719
See you at practice.

03:41.956 --> 03:44.223
(exhaling)

03:51.932 --> 03:53.832
Hi.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.000
Jackson.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.485
Hi.

03:56.486 --> 03:57.969
You can't just...
I know, I, uh,

03:57.972 --> 03:59.271
should have called.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.839
I'm sorry.

04:00.841 --> 04:01.940
Hey!

04:01.942 --> 04:02.941
Ella.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.593
Hey, how are you?

04:04.594 --> 04:06.244
Sweetie, just go inside
for one second, okay?

04:06.247 --> 04:07.946
Corrie...

04:07.948 --> 04:09.881
You're going to show
up here with a toy,

04:09.883 --> 04:10.916
everything's going
to be okay?

04:10.918 --> 04:11.950
She's my niece.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.018
Not today.
Well,

04:13.020 --> 04:14.586
then when, all right?

04:14.588 --> 04:18.357
It's been eight months,
four days and I am clean.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.858
I got a job,

04:19.860 --> 04:22.261
I'm doing the steps
and I miss my family.

04:22.263 --> 04:23.395
I'm sorry.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.763
The money you stole...

04:24.765 --> 04:27.366
I'll pay it back.
$680?

04:27.368 --> 04:29.368
I'll pay it back.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.669
That money was Ella's.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.337
For music lessons I promised
her 'cause $680

04:32.339 --> 04:34.339
takes a long time
to save.

04:34.341 --> 04:36.041
I'm sorry.

04:36.043 --> 04:38.277
Yeah, you were
sorry before.

04:38.279 --> 04:39.378
I promise...

04:39.380 --> 04:41.046
It's always
promises with you.

04:41.048 --> 04:44.549
If you want me to trust
you, you gotta show it.

04:45.519 --> 04:46.918
Okay.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.920
I'll get you the money.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.489
Okay.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.057
You get the money and
then we'll talk.
I will.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.492
Okay.
Today.

04:53.494 --> 04:56.428
I'll get you the money,
I'll pay you back.

05:06.340 --> 05:07.873
PARKER:
Let's make this drill
perfect, team.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.308
Only one shot in real life.

05:09.310 --> 05:10.642
Okay, team.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.311
Aggressive entry.

05:12.313 --> 05:14.346
Our guy's firing.
Shoot on the move,

05:14.348 --> 05:15.847
limit his angles.
ED:
Okay.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.349
Our guy's got a
flamethrower.

05:17.351 --> 05:18.784
Every eventuality,
let's go.

05:18.786 --> 05:20.786
Bravo team sends in a DD,
then rappels back up.

05:20.788 --> 05:21.887
Alpha comes in

05:21.889 --> 05:23.021
hard, other side.

05:23.023 --> 05:25.023
Okay, team,
final rehearsal.

05:25.025 --> 05:27.659
Keep sharp
and stay in formation.

05:27.661 --> 05:28.894
ED:
On my count.

05:29.530 --> 05:30.862
Three...

05:30.864 --> 05:32.397
two...

05:32.399 --> 05:33.532
one...

05:33.534 --> 05:35.067
go!

05:35.069 --> 05:36.468
Go! Go! Go!

05:36.470 --> 05:37.569
Go! Go! Go! Go!

05:37.571 --> 05:39.404
Down! Down!
Down! Down!

05:39.406 --> 05:40.706
Down! Down! Down! Down!

05:40.708 --> 05:42.341
Stay down!
Get down!

05:42.343 --> 05:44.376
Get down!
Get down!

05:44.378 --> 05:45.711
Get down!
Stay down!

05:45.713 --> 05:47.713
Stay down!
Stay down!
Ed!

05:49.717 --> 05:51.483
(grunts)

05:51.485 --> 05:54.119
Your breath is killing me, man.

05:54.121 --> 05:55.654
Sorry.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.389
Shel made cabbage rolls.

05:57.391 --> 05:58.990
Want to file a less lethal
report on those.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.726
Oh, watch it.
Let's see his hands!

06:00.728 --> 06:02.461
Let's see his hands!

06:02.463 --> 06:04.529
Get him up!

06:07.067 --> 06:09.067
Subject's secured.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.135
Again.

06:10.137 --> 06:11.903
Nice work, guys.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.438
Say it!

06:13.440 --> 06:14.623
Again!

06:14.624 --> 06:15.807
Again!
Let's reload the window.

06:15.809 --> 06:16.975
PARKER:
We're out of glass.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.143
Thank you,
Corporal.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.444
That was very
convincing.

06:19.446 --> 06:21.079
Good work, Sam.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.414
You're staying
on lead entry.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.015
I'm sure our
Special Ops guest

06:24.017 --> 06:26.017
will agree that we covered
every eventuality,

06:26.019 --> 06:28.019
backwards, forwards,
and in high heels.

06:28.021 --> 06:29.788
Yeah, well, if your
subject can fight

06:29.790 --> 06:31.022
these guys off?

06:31.024 --> 06:32.858
Tell him we can use him
in Kandahar.

06:32.860 --> 06:33.825
(laughter)

06:33.827 --> 06:35.460
Good.
All right.

06:35.461 --> 06:37.094
Let's recap in the Briefing Room
while we wait for the warrant.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.497
Good job!

06:50.110 --> 06:52.144
Hey, hey, uh,

06:52.146 --> 06:53.645
I was wondering
if you could lend me,

06:53.647 --> 06:55.647
I don't know maybe, like, uh...

06:55.649 --> 06:57.649
$700 or $600?

06:57.651 --> 06:59.017
That's all.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.754
Hey, uh, yeah, it's Jackson.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.122
I was just thinking maybe
I could work for a week,

07:04.124 --> 07:05.690
or a couple of weeks
if that's okay.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.194
No. Yeah.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.562
Okay.

07:10.564 --> 07:11.797
Um, okay, well, thank you.

07:11.799 --> 07:12.931
Thank you very much.

07:14.568 --> 07:18.003
Uh, like, uh, $600, $700.

07:18.005 --> 07:19.571
All right, no problem.

07:19.573 --> 07:22.207
Thank you though.

07:24.178 --> 07:26.445
<i> I could give you like</i>

07:26.447 --> 07:27.479
forty dollars.

07:27.481 --> 07:28.513
That's all I got right now,

07:28.515 --> 07:29.748
but you can totally have it.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.750
You know what? It's, uh...

07:31.752 --> 07:33.785
It's not a problem.
it's okay don't worry about it.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.787
Are you still going to stop by?

07:35.789 --> 07:37.622
Jackson?

08:07.521 --> 08:10.522
ED:
<i> So you're going to join us</i>
<i> or what?</i>

08:10.524 --> 08:12.524
My work here
is done.

08:12.526 --> 08:14.526
'Deeds, not words,'
my friend.

08:14.528 --> 08:16.094
Isn't that right,
Braddock?

08:16.096 --> 08:17.762
That's right.

08:17.764 --> 08:19.531
What do you mean
deeds not words?

08:19.533 --> 08:21.066
Army Special
Ops motto.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.767
Used to be his motto.

08:22.769 --> 08:24.102
Right. Right.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.237
So, how you been?

08:25.239 --> 08:27.606
Sun always shines
on Kandahar.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.241
Sally, is that
warrant in?

08:29.243 --> 08:31.510
Still waiting.

08:34.081 --> 08:36.181
(phone rings)

08:42.890 --> 08:44.556
Yeah.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.224
Jackson.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.893
Where you been, little man?

08:47.895 --> 08:49.961
No phone call, no postcard.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.298
All this time
that's the first thing you ask?

08:53.300 --> 08:54.966
You're asking for money?

08:54.968 --> 08:56.234
No.

08:56.236 --> 08:58.236
You know what? No problem.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.639
Why don't you come over
and we can talk about it.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.707
Okay, I'm on my way.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.083
<i> What's the deal</i>

09:12.085 --> 09:13.919
on the guy you're
taking down?
Name's Sean Keenan.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.587
Got a boatload of priors,

09:15.589 --> 09:17.923
squeaked his way out
of a couple of homicide charges,

09:17.925 --> 09:19.958
he's looking at his
third strike today.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.093
Oh, so he's got
nothing to lose.
Oh, man,

09:22.095 --> 09:23.762
it's the worst kind.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.330
Still, days like today...

09:25.332 --> 09:26.798
Yeah, they make
you feel alive.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.817
That's right.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.835
Uh, you know Sam Braddock
was in our unit, right?

09:30.837 --> 09:32.571
Yeah.

09:32.573 --> 09:34.606
What, something
I should know?

09:34.608 --> 09:36.575
It's not my place to say.

09:36.577 --> 09:38.377
I don't do innuendo.

09:38.378 --> 09:40.178
You got something to say about
a member of my team, say it.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.846
I'm saying it.

09:41.848 --> 09:43.949
Watch your team's back.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.951
Good luck today.

09:45.953 --> 09:48.019
Yeah.

10:01.702 --> 10:05.370
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

10:34.935 --> 10:38.003
SALLY (over speaker):
Warrant's in.
Team One, you're up, you're up.

10:46.213 --> 10:51.082
(siren wailing)

10:53.987 --> 10:57.389
(police siren wails)

11:01.862 --> 11:04.829
(tires screeching)

11:20.180 --> 11:21.780
Greetings.

11:21.782 --> 11:22.847
Nothing if not punctual, huh?

11:22.849 --> 11:25.784
What, only two sentries?

11:25.786 --> 11:27.285
That's interesting,
a day like today.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.703
You want a no tip-off guarantee,

11:28.704 --> 11:30.120
how about we round up
the whole neighborhood?

11:31.692 --> 11:33.258
How's it look?
It's good.

11:33.260 --> 11:34.926
Just waiting on word from
Geddes, seconds away.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.294
Here's the elevator
service key.

11:36.296 --> 11:37.796
Geddes your undercover?

11:37.798 --> 11:38.830
WORDY:
Harlan Geddes?

11:38.832 --> 11:40.315
Yeah, you know him?

11:40.316 --> 11:41.799
Yeah, we partnered
at 21 together.

11:41.802 --> 11:43.435
Had a barbecue
a couple weeks ago.

11:43.437 --> 11:45.170
What's his in?
NAISMITH:
He's worked his way up

11:45.172 --> 11:46.805
through the ranks over
the past eight months

11:46.807 --> 11:48.973
from a lowlife to
mid-level runner.

11:48.975 --> 11:51.142
Trust factor's pretty high,
so Asshat's giving Geddes

11:51.144 --> 11:52.811
a slice to sell to the
neighborhood kids.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.846
Anything else
we need to know?
Yeah.

11:54.848 --> 11:56.347
You know about the
double homicide, right?
Yeah, yeah.

11:56.349 --> 11:57.449
How'd he beat that rap?

11:57.451 --> 11:58.850
Joys of the
justice system.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.285
Look, if this guy
feels cornered,

12:00.286 --> 12:01.719
he's gonna
bite, okay?
Speed and surprise.

12:01.722 --> 12:02.871
We get it.

12:02.872 --> 12:04.021
Yeah, you do this right,
Geddes gets a shower

12:04.024 --> 12:05.457
and shave, okay?

12:05.458 --> 12:06.891
Takes Miriam out
someplace nice for a change.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.059
Thought "junkie
chic" got you

12:08.060 --> 12:09.226
into<i> all</i> the good
restaurants.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.762
Good to go?

12:10.764 --> 12:11.963
Hmm?

12:11.965 --> 12:13.131
Absolutely.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.866
Okay.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.735
Did he say "asshat"?

12:16.737 --> 12:18.136
He said "asshat."

12:21.408 --> 12:24.142
Hey, nice shoes.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.143
Hey, what's up, man?

12:25.145 --> 12:26.144
You don't look
at people

12:26.146 --> 12:27.579
when they're
talking to you?

12:27.580 --> 12:29.013
My boy said he
likes your shoes.

12:29.015 --> 12:30.482
Yeah, thanks.

12:30.484 --> 12:32.450
Yo, I didn't hear
no respect, B.

12:32.452 --> 12:33.985
Yo, you better
show some respect

12:33.987 --> 12:35.420
before you get
slapped up.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.756
Hey, yo, do
I know you?

12:37.758 --> 12:39.224
Guys, look...
Nah.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.258
Do I know you?

12:40.260 --> 12:41.626
'Cause I<i> don't</i> know you,

12:41.627 --> 12:42.993
and you want
to walk<i> my</i> street?

12:42.996 --> 12:44.996
Yo, you gotta drop
some paper, B.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.164
MAN:
Hey, Jackson.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.300
Hey, man.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.936
Jackson, what's up, man?

12:51.938 --> 12:53.872
Hey.

12:53.874 --> 12:54.973
Hey!

12:58.178 --> 12:59.811
You want
to be careful, man.

12:59.813 --> 13:01.079
You ain't been around
in a while.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.247
Yeah.

13:02.249 --> 13:03.815
You need some help?

13:03.817 --> 13:05.316
You need me
to hook you up?

13:05.318 --> 13:07.986
No, I'm just here
to see Sean.

13:09.055 --> 13:11.222
All right, man, don't want
to hold you back.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.091
Thanks.

13:24.070 --> 13:27.138
(beeping)

13:31.578 --> 13:33.444
Hey, it's Geddes.
We're a go.

13:34.548 --> 13:36.080
All right, planets
are in alignment.

13:36.082 --> 13:37.415
Shipment's in, target's alone.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.516
This is it.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.084
SAM:
Let's do this.
Alpha Team,

13:40.086 --> 13:42.020
we're switching up--
Sam, you're gonna be three.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.154
I'm gonna take lead entry.

13:44.191 --> 13:45.490
We're changing
the tac plan?

13:45.492 --> 13:47.559
Tac plan's a thing
of beauty-- let's go.

13:47.561 --> 13:49.360
Jules, Spike,
drop us off roof side.

13:49.362 --> 13:50.461
Why?

13:50.463 --> 13:51.563
Because when you're
democratically

13:51.565 --> 13:53.264
elected team leader,

13:53.266 --> 13:54.899
you get to make
autocratic decisions.

13:54.901 --> 13:56.301
Let's go.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.169
Be careful, children.

14:08.114 --> 14:10.081
PARKER:
Ed, I've got you on screen.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.183
Alpha, Bravo, proceed.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.985
2:03 PM.

14:13.987 --> 14:16.554
Elevated risk narcotics warrant.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.023
Underway.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.025
Subject, Sean Keenan.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.460
PARKER (over radio):
Just like we drilled, team.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.963
Secure, enter, arrest.

14:24.965 --> 14:27.532
Floor four:
ladies' blouses,

14:27.534 --> 14:30.201
perfumes and
fragrances.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.216
Okay, Ed, our guys

14:45.218 --> 14:47.318
are almost at the roof.

14:49.623 --> 14:51.623
You know, I'm good here.

14:51.625 --> 14:53.291
You want to go
check if your boys

14:53.293 --> 14:54.359
got the outer
perimeter secure?

14:54.361 --> 14:55.360
No, it's secure.

14:55.362 --> 14:56.961
You want to make sure
your guys

14:56.963 --> 14:57.428
get my 15 keys out
in piece?

15:02.135 --> 15:04.135
How come we can
never get along?

15:15.181 --> 15:18.149
Bravo Team?

15:18.151 --> 15:19.250
Bravo Team?

15:19.252 --> 15:20.485
Gearing up.

15:24.190 --> 15:26.024
Hey, a waste of time, man.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.325
Store's closed-- come on.

15:27.327 --> 15:29.127
I'm not shopping.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.163
Little man!

15:32.165 --> 15:34.032
Look at you, huh?

15:34.034 --> 15:36.200
(laughs):
Look at you.

15:36.202 --> 15:38.336
Where you been
all my life?

15:38.338 --> 15:39.537
Hey, we're done.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.139
You get that product
on the street.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.674
You're still
on probation.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.208
Yeah, I just ran into Jackson
on the stairs.

15:44.210 --> 15:45.243
We should hit it, man.

15:45.245 --> 15:46.477
You two know each other?

15:46.479 --> 15:48.613
Yeah, Jackson
and me go back.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.448
Interesting.
Jacks, man,

15:50.450 --> 15:52.684
we should shake it--
I got you covered.

15:52.686 --> 15:54.152
No, I got a better idea.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.288
This is good.

16:01.227 --> 16:02.226
Get in here.

16:06.566 --> 16:08.466
Bravo Team's seconds away.

16:35.762 --> 16:39.030
(whirring)

16:44.270 --> 16:47.438
(electronic humming)

16:50.276 --> 16:52.176
Clear.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.411
Looks good.

16:53.413 --> 16:55.613
Alpha Team holding.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.782
Bravo Team, prepare to rappel.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.350
Copy.

17:05.225 --> 17:07.258
Where's Geddes?

17:07.260 --> 17:09.093
He should be here
by now.

17:09.095 --> 17:10.361
Call him.

17:19.639 --> 17:22.507
Alpha, Bravo,
action on my go.

17:28.181 --> 17:29.447
Three...

17:33.353 --> 17:35.319
two...

17:35.321 --> 17:37.622
Yo, I'm still busy
with my friend, okay?

17:38.591 --> 17:39.590
Geddes is back inside.

17:39.592 --> 17:40.658
One.

17:44.597 --> 17:47.098
Three... two...

17:47.100 --> 17:49.400
GEDDES (on phone):
Yo, I'm still busy
with my friend, okay?

17:49.402 --> 17:50.802
Geddes is back inside.

17:50.803 --> 17:52.203
One.
PARKER (over radio):
Hold, hold.

17:52.205 --> 17:54.172
Alpha, Bravo, hold.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.774
Holding.
Holding.

17:56.776 --> 17:59.277
Geddes is inside--
what's he doing?
I don't know.

17:59.279 --> 18:00.211
Still holding.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.213
Plan's changed.
ED:
Boss...

18:02.215 --> 18:05.283
Fall back,
fall back.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.684
Okay.

18:07.654 --> 18:08.853
You done?

18:08.855 --> 18:10.321
Yeah, sorry.

18:10.323 --> 18:11.355
Client.

18:14.127 --> 18:15.226
Jackson...

18:16.196 --> 18:18.362
See something you like?

18:23.303 --> 18:26.137
You're not going in?
Give me the tenant profiles.

18:26.139 --> 18:27.472
You know the street value
of the drugs in there?

18:27.474 --> 18:29.307
Do you want your guy caught
in the crossfire?

18:29.309 --> 18:31.275
We're falling back--
tenant profiles.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.811
Alpha Team, let's
get eyes in.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.146
All right.

18:35.148 --> 18:36.380
Neighbors to the right,
there's trouble.

18:36.382 --> 18:37.215
Left, trouble.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.216
Upstairs?

18:38.218 --> 18:39.383
It's under renovation.

18:39.385 --> 18:41.152
That's good.
Ed, sixth floor.

18:41.154 --> 18:43.238
Copy that.

18:43.239 --> 18:45.323
Bravo Team, fall back
to the sixth floor.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.257
Game's changed.

18:46.259 --> 18:47.859
JULES (over radio):
Copy.

18:50.497 --> 18:52.864
So much for speed and surprise.

18:55.735 --> 18:59.137
So, Jackson, you got a meet-up
with your probie today?

18:59.139 --> 19:00.605
Uh, no.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.006
No?

19:02.007 --> 19:03.406
You on the breakfast TV
this morning?

19:03.409 --> 19:04.442
Win the free makeover?

19:04.444 --> 19:06.544
Yeah, guy
looks sharp, huh?

19:06.546 --> 19:09.180
Think I could clean
up as good as you?

19:09.182 --> 19:11.282
Shave and a haircut?

19:15.288 --> 19:17.355
So like I was saying,

19:17.357 --> 19:18.456
we should get moving.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.291
I'll take care of you.

19:20.293 --> 19:22.160
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Huh?

19:22.162 --> 19:23.828
What about your money?

19:23.830 --> 19:25.263
Oh, I'll come get it later.

19:25.265 --> 19:26.664
Yeah?
Yeah.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.432
No.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.602
Sit.

19:42.315 --> 19:44.615
We need to ask you to
evacuate while we take care

19:44.617 --> 19:46.384
of a police investigation
in the building.

19:46.386 --> 19:49.187
Please exit as quickly as
you can down the stairs.

19:49.189 --> 19:51.722
MAN:
Come on, guys, let's go.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.903
So, Jackson...

20:05.905 --> 20:06.871
Shut up.

20:09.576 --> 20:10.575
So how long were you in for?

20:10.577 --> 20:12.543
Uh, 30 days.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.846
30 days? Must be
the choirboy face.

20:15.848 --> 20:19.317
So 30 days, but I haven't see
you in what, six, eight months?

20:19.319 --> 20:21.619
Yeah, I've been busy
doing some stuff.

20:21.621 --> 20:22.887
Fix you something?

20:26.593 --> 20:28.893
Um... no, man.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.561
Thanks, I'm good.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.597
30 days go by,

20:32.599 --> 20:35.266
you're out and about,
you don't call...

20:35.268 --> 20:36.667
I feel kind of hurt.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.003
Yeah, sorry.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.738
How you guys know
each other again?

20:40.740 --> 20:42.607
I used to see him at the Grouse.

20:42.609 --> 20:43.641
Right...

20:43.643 --> 20:45.309
See smart guys

20:45.311 --> 20:46.577
like you don't
come around too often--

20:46.579 --> 20:47.945
case in point.

20:48.982 --> 20:50.481
And we had a good
thing going.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.583
Hmm? Give me your bag.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.752
Come on, man,
I got customers waiting.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.020
You're going into partnership.

20:56.990 --> 20:58.889
You remember
what I promised you?

21:00.260 --> 21:01.626
Big things.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.694
I keep my promises, little man.

21:05.732 --> 21:09.300
This is me saying,

21:09.302 --> 21:10.735
"I want you back."

21:13.373 --> 21:14.538
Show of faith.

21:14.540 --> 21:15.773
It's on me.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.775
How much did you say
you needed, huh?

21:17.777 --> 21:19.377
You take this
to the street,

21:19.379 --> 21:21.646
you're back in the game.

21:21.647 --> 21:23.914
Maybe you even got a little
extra left over for yourself.

21:26.619 --> 21:29.487
Um...

21:29.489 --> 21:31.355
Nah, man, I'm... I'm good.

21:31.357 --> 21:32.790
I'm just, uh...
You're sure you're good,

21:32.792 --> 21:34.292
'cause you don't look
so good to me?

21:34.293 --> 21:35.793
And I'm not so sure
who it is I'm talking to,

21:35.795 --> 21:37.762
you know what I'm saying--
who you turned into.
It's Jackson.

21:37.764 --> 21:39.830
Sean, come on man,
chill. It's Jacks.

21:39.832 --> 21:41.465
It's all good.
I'm talking.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.635
Can I trust you, little man?

21:44.637 --> 21:46.804
Look me in the eyes.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.707
'Cause I think you just
failed your first test.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.346
Yo, we've been
lookin' for you, man.

21:55.348 --> 21:57.048
What's up?
Cops on the roof, yo.

21:57.050 --> 21:58.582
Yo, it's SWAT.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.892
Let's get that ball camera
outside the window.

22:07.894 --> 22:10.561
Boss is right; we don't proceed
unless the subject's alone.

22:10.563 --> 22:12.396
SAM:
The undercover
knows we're coming.

22:12.398 --> 22:14.565
You know what happened
the last time this guy

22:14.567 --> 22:15.666
had unexpected company.

22:15.668 --> 22:16.667
Where are my eyes?

22:16.669 --> 22:19.470
Coming up, boss.

22:19.472 --> 22:22.640
Sean, come on, man,
I just came here for a loan.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.709
I swear.
Yeah?

22:25.712 --> 22:27.445
Yeah.

22:31.384 --> 22:33.451
Okay.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.953
(chuckles)

22:35.955 --> 22:38.055
Okay...

22:38.057 --> 22:39.623
(cell phone rings)

22:45.865 --> 22:47.598
You getting this?

22:47.600 --> 22:49.967
Yeah, I'm getting it.

22:49.969 --> 22:52.570
Okay, that's Geddes.
Okay, Geddes confirmed.

22:52.572 --> 22:54.372
That's Keenan.

22:55.908 --> 22:58.676
We got somebody else here.

22:58.678 --> 23:00.044
It's three individuals.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.512
Who's this?

23:01.514 --> 23:02.747
No idea.

23:02.749 --> 23:05.683
Sally, I'm sending you a snap.

23:05.685 --> 23:08.152
We've got a new subject
in our friend's loft.

23:08.154 --> 23:09.954
Let's see if we can
get some ID him.

23:09.956 --> 23:11.489
SALLY (over headset):
Copy that, standing by.

23:11.491 --> 23:13.691
(phone smashes)
I knew it!

23:13.693 --> 23:15.793
I could smell it on you!
GEDDES:
Sean! Sean!

23:15.795 --> 23:17.061
Keep it cool, man.
What's going on?

23:17.063 --> 23:18.662
You got your cop buddies
outside?

23:18.664 --> 23:20.598
Cops?!
30 days...

23:20.600 --> 23:22.066
I'm gonna kill you,
you lying piece...

23:22.068 --> 23:23.834
No, no, Sean, I didn't call
the cops, I swear.

23:23.836 --> 23:25.035
Come here.

23:27.006 --> 23:29.440
You getting this, boss?

23:29.442 --> 23:30.741
The gun's on the unknown,

23:30.743 --> 23:33.110
not Geddes.
What the hell is going on?

23:33.112 --> 23:34.678
I said, "Come here."
Sean!

23:34.680 --> 23:35.913
Sean, I would
never do that to you.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.681
I took you
under my wing.

23:37.683 --> 23:39.784
I gave you financial
independence.

23:39.786 --> 23:42.553
Sean, think about this, man.
It's not gonna help us, okay?

23:48.461 --> 23:50.895
All right, we got
a clean line, let's go.

23:50.897 --> 23:51.829
Geddes's not armed?
No.

23:51.831 --> 23:52.930
Team, I need options.

23:52.932 --> 23:53.964
ED (over headset):
Aggressive entry,

23:53.966 --> 23:55.533
Beta plan.

23:55.535 --> 23:57.034
Jules, Spike, five and six.

23:57.036 --> 23:59.036
Spike, double up on flashbangs,
let's go.

23:59.038 --> 24:01.872
(cries):
I'm only doing this
because I promised my sister!

24:01.874 --> 24:03.174
Look at me!

24:03.176 --> 24:06.577
You sold me out.

24:06.579 --> 24:08.712
Sean, I didn't! I didn't!
GEDDES:
Sean! Sean!

24:08.714 --> 24:10.681
Listen to me! Listen to me!
Just put the gun down.

24:10.683 --> 24:12.650
Okay, that's not gonna...
that's not gonna help.

24:13.820 --> 24:14.952
Trouble. Geddes's moved.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.687
He's in the
line of fire.

24:19.025 --> 24:20.558
Hold! Hold!

24:20.560 --> 24:22.660
Give me Keenan's phone number.

24:22.662 --> 24:24.562
Come on.

24:24.564 --> 24:25.930
Sean, you don't want
to do this, man, okay?

24:25.932 --> 24:28.232
I invest in you.

24:28.234 --> 24:29.867
I put my trust in you.

24:29.869 --> 24:31.902
Look, let's think this
through, okay?
And you spit

24:31.904 --> 24:33.037
on all that to make yourself

24:33.039 --> 24:34.805
a deal?
It couldn't be Jacks.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.106
Okay, just leave the kid alone.

24:44.750 --> 24:46.083
You had a future.
Don't do it.

24:46.085 --> 24:47.651
One more word...

24:49.088 --> 24:50.621
Sean, please...

24:50.623 --> 24:52.923
I trusted you.

24:52.925 --> 24:54.625
It wasn't me.

24:58.064 --> 24:59.230
(groans)

25:05.671 --> 25:06.904
Shot fired! Officer down!
Officer down!

25:06.906 --> 25:09.173
Sally, EMT, 725 Parliament.

25:09.175 --> 25:10.241
No siren, no siren.

25:10.243 --> 25:11.542
Get him out. Get him out.
No.

25:11.544 --> 25:12.543
Keenan's still armed.

25:12.545 --> 25:13.577
Two people in the crossfire.

25:13.579 --> 25:15.396
Just give me his phone number.

25:15.397 --> 25:17.214
Your guys are at the door.
Get him out!

25:17.216 --> 25:18.582
Team, I'm going
to start talking.

25:18.584 --> 25:19.583
Jules, you're my secondary.

25:19.585 --> 25:21.085
JULES: Copy.
Wordy, Lewis,

25:21.087 --> 25:22.887
on sentry. Ed?

25:22.889 --> 25:24.722
ED (over headset):
I'm on it. Got it. Copy.

25:26.092 --> 25:28.058
(groans)

25:28.060 --> 25:29.660
You still alive, douche?

25:29.662 --> 25:31.862
You want some more?
No, don't kill him. He's a cop.

25:31.864 --> 25:32.997
He's not a cop, he's a lousy...

25:32.999 --> 25:34.265
He's a cop, okay? He's a cop.

25:34.267 --> 25:36.033
Don't kill him.
Don't make it worse.

25:39.171 --> 25:41.105
You see that hit he took?
Shotgun blast out of a revolver.

25:41.107 --> 25:42.873
That's no
Saturday night special.

25:43.743 --> 25:45.709
We need a new entry plan.

25:45.711 --> 25:47.645
No time; we should be
in there already.

25:47.647 --> 25:48.846
Jules, stay on that monitor.

25:48.848 --> 25:50.814
Let me know
if the geography changes.

25:50.816 --> 25:53.250
Sally, I need you.

25:53.252 --> 25:55.319
You know he's a cop
and you don't tell me?!

25:55.321 --> 25:56.887
I didn't know, okay?
I just recognized him

25:56.889 --> 25:58.656
just now, he's one
of the guys that arrested me.

26:00.626 --> 26:02.693
Cop...

26:05.731 --> 26:07.932
Hey! You will not negotiate this

26:07.934 --> 26:09.833
while my guy bleeds to death.
You want a free-for-all,

26:09.835 --> 26:11.669
go in yourself
and take your chances.

26:11.671 --> 26:13.337
Or you let me do
what I'm here to do

26:13.339 --> 26:15.239
and maybe people
come out alive.

26:16.809 --> 26:18.876
Damn it.

26:19.979 --> 26:21.779
Sally, isolate this phone line:

26:21.781 --> 26:24.682
555-0166.

26:27.587 --> 26:29.753
Cop! Frickin' cop!

26:29.755 --> 26:31.589
Hey, where are you going?

26:31.591 --> 26:33.023
He's going to bleed
to death.
Let him.

26:33.025 --> 26:34.758
You want to go down
for murder, too?

26:34.760 --> 26:36.727
They ask you,

26:36.728 --> 26:38.695
you tell them...
it was an accident.

26:38.698 --> 26:39.763
(groans)
Okay.

26:39.765 --> 26:40.965
He jumped me.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.800
You saw it. He jumped me.

26:42.802 --> 26:44.835
There was a struggle.
The gun went off.

26:44.837 --> 26:46.337
Yes, there was a struggle.
It was an accident.

26:46.339 --> 26:47.871
He jumped me.
The gun went off.

26:47.873 --> 26:49.807
It was an accident.
It was an accident.

26:49.809 --> 26:51.308
I can trust you on this.

26:51.310 --> 26:53.210
Yeah, you can trust me, man.

26:53.212 --> 26:55.746
Okay, you're not going anywhere.

26:55.748 --> 26:58.248
You and me, little man.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.884
(phone ringing)

27:00.886 --> 27:02.953
Let's do this.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.823
Bolt the door.

27:08.928 --> 27:10.995
(phone continues ringing)

27:21.307 --> 27:23.040
Yeah?

27:23.042 --> 27:24.642
This is Sergeant Greg Parker

27:24.644 --> 27:26.310
with the police,
Strategic Response Unit.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.045
Am I speaking with Sean Keenan?

27:28.047 --> 27:29.647
Yes, you are.

27:29.649 --> 27:31.248
How can I help you, Greg.

27:31.250 --> 27:32.282
You want to tell me

27:32.284 --> 27:34.151
what's going on here today?

27:34.153 --> 27:35.386
Why, Greg?

27:35.388 --> 27:37.655
What's on your mind, hmm?

27:38.791 --> 27:40.924
Option A: we let the boss
talk him out.

27:40.926 --> 27:42.426
Option B: we try
to isolate Keenan,

27:42.428 --> 27:44.061
maybe we got a shot
at a clean rescue.

27:44.063 --> 27:46.864
What about immediate entry?
Wordy, hold off.

27:46.866 --> 27:49.933
Well, Sean, a firearm was
discharged in your vicinity,

27:49.935 --> 27:53.137
your area, in your neighborhood,
and we were just wondering

27:53.139 --> 27:54.938
if everyone in there
was all right.

27:54.940 --> 27:56.340
We're great.

27:56.342 --> 27:58.942
Thank you very much for asking.

27:58.944 --> 28:00.944
How about you, Greg?

28:00.946 --> 28:02.880
How are you doing?

28:02.882 --> 28:03.914
(hushed):
Hurry up.

28:05.718 --> 28:07.317
You know what, Sean,

28:07.319 --> 28:09.987
let's cut the pleasantries
and get to the point, okay?

28:09.989 --> 28:11.321
We both know why
my team and I are here.

28:11.323 --> 28:12.756
Right? You know?

28:12.758 --> 28:16.360
Why don't you tell me
all about it?

28:17.329 --> 28:19.096
Thanks, Sally.

28:19.098 --> 28:21.432
Weapon Keenan's carrying
is called The Jury.

28:21.434 --> 28:24.001
"The Jury"?
That's a street name, it's new.

28:24.003 --> 28:26.403
It takes five rounds,
shotgun, a single bore.

28:26.405 --> 28:28.105
Explains the size
of the wound.

28:28.107 --> 28:29.807
Yeah.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.177
Hey, man.
Easy, easy, easy...

28:33.179 --> 28:34.278
You're gonna be okay, all right?

28:35.881 --> 28:37.047
You should get out.

28:37.049 --> 28:38.449
I remember you.

28:38.451 --> 28:40.951
At the Green Grouse,
it was you who arrested me.

28:40.953 --> 28:43.454
Sorry...
No, no-no, man,
don't be sorry.

28:43.456 --> 28:45.222
It turned my life around.

28:45.224 --> 28:48.759
Kid...

28:48.761 --> 28:50.260
go on, get out.

28:57.036 --> 28:58.769
We got a guy dying in there.

28:58.771 --> 29:00.003
He's in the line of fire.

29:00.005 --> 29:01.872
So how long...
And we also have an unknown

29:01.874 --> 29:03.941
who is in the line of fire.

29:03.943 --> 29:06.076
Are we saving cops
or we saving drug dealers?

29:06.078 --> 29:07.044
Don't let it
get personal, Wordy.

29:07.046 --> 29:08.979
I'm just saying.

29:08.981 --> 29:10.147
He had the gun pointed
at the kid.

29:10.149 --> 29:11.281
Lover's quarrel.

29:11.283 --> 29:13.117
Body language, haircut,

29:13.119 --> 29:16.019
nice clothes--
it just doesn't add up.

29:16.021 --> 29:17.421
We do an explosive entry,
flashbangs...

29:17.423 --> 29:20.090
Keenan still has time
to fire his weapon.

29:20.092 --> 29:22.960
He's right, we got more
than one life here.

29:22.962 --> 29:24.394
I'm not putting
this kid at risk.

29:24.396 --> 29:25.863
PARKER:
<i> I don't give a flying</i>

29:25.865 --> 29:28.232
king-size crap
what you do for a living.

29:28.234 --> 29:29.466
I've got a friend in there,

29:29.468 --> 29:31.268
and I want to get him out alive.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.003
You're a smart guy.

29:33.005 --> 29:35.339
I expect you're fully familiar
with how to use a toilet.

29:35.341 --> 29:38.208
Hey, you've done this before.

29:38.210 --> 29:40.077
Nothing but the best and
brightest for you, Sean.

29:40.079 --> 29:41.945
You've very important to us,

29:41.947 --> 29:44.281
so if we can both handle
this professionally, the boys

29:44.283 --> 29:46.283
and I won't have to come in
there and trouble you at all.

29:46.285 --> 29:47.951
So you do what you've got to do.

29:47.953 --> 29:49.887
(Geddes groans)

29:56.962 --> 29:58.162
Go on, get out.

29:58.164 --> 30:00.798
Man, we're both
getting out of here.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.900
Can't do it.

30:02.901 --> 30:05.001
'Cause there's only a couple
of ways this can go, right?

30:05.004 --> 30:08.972
And we're not looking
for more people to get hurt.

30:08.974 --> 30:11.008
This guy's on his
third strike.

30:11.010 --> 30:13.010
He's going to be all about
the blaze of glory.

30:13.012 --> 30:14.444
How's Geddes doing?

30:14.446 --> 30:15.946
He's hanging in there.

30:15.948 --> 30:16.980
I don't know how much longer.

30:16.982 --> 30:19.082
Options.

30:19.084 --> 30:21.652
We're not coming up
with any other choices, boss.

30:21.653 --> 30:24.221
We go through the window...
And he'll use you as
target practice. No.

30:24.223 --> 30:25.556
Thanks, Sally.

30:27.526 --> 30:29.193
Our unknown
is Jackson Barcliffe, 21,

30:29.195 --> 30:30.527
a former client of Keenan's.

30:30.529 --> 30:33.864
He was arrested eight months
ago for possession.

30:33.866 --> 30:35.065
His parole officer says

30:35.067 --> 30:36.900
that he's been
on the wagon ever since.

30:36.902 --> 30:38.869
On the wagon
until today, I guess.

30:38.871 --> 30:40.938
PARKER:
Sean, we can resolve this

30:40.939 --> 30:43.006
peacefully right now
if you make the right choice.

30:43.008 --> 30:45.008
Place your weapon on the floor,
and you come out the door...

30:45.010 --> 30:47.044
Okay, Greg. I hear ya.

30:47.046 --> 30:51.281
I just need to think over
my options over here.

30:58.457 --> 31:00.858
(Geddes groans)

31:02.995 --> 31:04.995
Well, you do.
You think about those options.

31:04.997 --> 31:06.363
But you think about them
very carefully,

31:06.365 --> 31:08.131
because you're already
apprehended, right?

31:08.133 --> 31:09.816
That's a given.

31:09.817 --> 31:11.500
What about the kid?
Come on, he made his choice.

31:11.503 --> 31:12.903
How's he doing?

31:12.905 --> 31:14.004
He's still breathing.

31:18.510 --> 31:21.979
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.254
If you want to make things
better for your future,

31:30.256 --> 31:31.521
you should think
about showing us

31:31.523 --> 31:33.290
that you can make
the right choice.

31:33.292 --> 31:35.559
Running out of time, Ed.
(phone ringing)

31:35.561 --> 31:37.928
Yeah?

31:37.930 --> 31:39.296
It's the kid in the room.

31:50.042 --> 31:51.408
Let me see that.

31:52.444 --> 31:54.111
Jackson.

31:54.113 --> 31:56.446
My name's Ed, I'm a police
officer-- I'm with the SRU.

31:56.448 --> 31:59.049
I want to help.

31:59.051 --> 32:00.450
Okay, okay, let's talk.

32:03.555 --> 32:05.455
Jackson, you did
the right thing calling.

32:05.457 --> 32:08.191
The man who was shot,
how's he doing?

32:08.193 --> 32:10.260
Uh, there's a...
there's a lot of blood.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.361
He's bleeding
pretty bad.

32:11.363 --> 32:12.396
ED:
Okay, is he breathing?

32:12.398 --> 32:13.397
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
he's breathing.

32:13.399 --> 32:14.998
All right, his name's Harlan.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.566
Now, I need you to do
me a favor, Jackson.

32:16.568 --> 32:18.302
I need you to move your
finger back and forth

32:18.304 --> 32:19.303
in front of his eyes.

32:19.305 --> 32:21.004
No, he's conscious, it's fine.

32:21.006 --> 32:22.205
Okay, that's good.

32:22.207 --> 32:23.640
That's good.

32:23.642 --> 32:26.076
Look, um, I can't talk long.

32:26.078 --> 32:27.277
If Sean comes in...

32:27.279 --> 32:28.445
All right,
if he comes back, Jackson,

32:28.447 --> 32:29.780
just put the phone down, okay?

32:29.781 --> 32:31.114
Just put the phone down,
but leave it on,

32:31.116 --> 32:32.983
all right, that way
we can hear you.

32:32.985 --> 32:35.285
Make the smart choice, and that
sends a positive message.

32:37.189 --> 32:39.256
(crying):
This is all my fault.

32:39.258 --> 32:42.125
This should've never happened,
I just...

32:42.127 --> 32:43.560
I just...

32:43.562 --> 32:44.828
Take it easy, Jackson.

32:44.829 --> 32:46.095
I just need you
to listen for a...

32:46.098 --> 32:48.165
I swear to God, I'm clean,
I'm clean now.

32:48.167 --> 32:49.199
Jackson, that's amazing.

32:49.201 --> 32:50.233
Are you doing the steps?

32:50.235 --> 32:51.234
Yeah, yeah.

32:51.236 --> 32:52.569
Eight months.

32:52.571 --> 32:53.704
That's incredible,
that's incredible.

32:53.706 --> 32:55.072
That shows me that you've

32:55.074 --> 32:56.740
got a lot of strength
and you can do this.

32:56.742 --> 32:58.408
All right, you want
to help, I need you

32:58.410 --> 33:00.544
to wrap that towel tight
against his stomach, okay?

33:00.546 --> 33:03.413
He's still bleeding,
and we gotta slow that down.

33:03.415 --> 33:05.148
ED:
Okay, we gotta
get in there.

33:05.150 --> 33:07.184
We gotta get in there
and do our job.

33:07.186 --> 33:10.153
I don't want to see you get
hurt, so I need you to get out.

33:10.155 --> 33:11.989
JACKSON:
No, no, I'm not leaving--
this is my fault.

33:11.991 --> 33:13.090
No, we've got an
ambulance on the way.

33:13.092 --> 33:14.458
It's my fault.

33:14.460 --> 33:16.693
I'm not leaving.

33:16.695 --> 33:18.195
Okay.

33:18.197 --> 33:19.162
Take a look at the door.

33:19.164 --> 33:20.364
Do you see anything unusual?

33:20.366 --> 33:22.532
Any booby traps, any
wires around the frame,

33:22.534 --> 33:23.700
around the door
handle, any...

33:23.702 --> 33:24.701
No, uh...

33:24.703 --> 33:26.336
it's two locks and a bolt.

33:26.338 --> 33:27.437
Good.

33:27.439 --> 33:29.139
Okay, that's good news.

33:29.141 --> 33:31.091
Okay, here's the thing.

33:31.092 --> 33:33.042
If we come in now,
Jackson, you and Geddes

33:33.045 --> 33:34.411
are right in the line of fire.

33:34.413 --> 33:37.280
Okay, so what I'm gonna
ask you to do is move him

33:37.282 --> 33:38.482
to the other room.

33:38.484 --> 33:40.217
Okay, I... I can try.

33:40.219 --> 33:41.351
KEENAN:
Uh-huh.

33:41.353 --> 33:42.386
Uh-huh.

33:42.388 --> 33:44.488
Jackson? Jackson?

33:46.125 --> 33:47.391
Well, you know, Greg,

33:47.393 --> 33:49.393
I, uh... I appreciate the, uh,

33:49.395 --> 33:51.261
approach you're taking here.

33:51.263 --> 33:53.196
You sound
like a reasonable man.

33:55.134 --> 33:57.300
KEENAN (over speaker):
Well, Greg, you know, uh,

33:57.302 --> 33:58.702
I respect your point of view.

34:00.239 --> 34:02.372
I do, yeah.

34:05.110 --> 34:07.177
Okay, man, I'm gonna try
and move you, okay?

34:07.179 --> 34:08.678
All right, ready?

34:08.680 --> 34:10.480
Come on.

34:10.482 --> 34:12.182
(groaning)

34:12.184 --> 34:13.550
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.552
KEENAN:
You know, I'd like to
deal with someone...

34:15.554 --> 34:16.553
My name is...

34:16.555 --> 34:18.121
Harlan...

34:19.091 --> 34:20.190
Hmm?

34:21.827 --> 34:24.194
My name...

34:24.196 --> 34:26.830
is Harlan Geddes.

34:26.832 --> 34:28.598
Please...

34:29.568 --> 34:31.134
Tell...

34:31.136 --> 34:33.136
Tell my wife...

34:33.138 --> 34:34.838
I love her.

34:34.840 --> 34:37.274
(sighs)

34:37.276 --> 34:39.242
We're losing him.

34:39.244 --> 34:41.244
The kid's putting himself
on the line here.

34:41.246 --> 34:42.846
We already got an officer
on the line here.

34:42.848 --> 34:44.481
Careful.

34:49.188 --> 34:51.421
Tell my boys...

34:51.423 --> 34:54.257
I'm... proud of them.

34:55.427 --> 34:58.161
And I love them... okay?

34:59.131 --> 35:00.297
Eddie...

35:00.299 --> 35:02.265
You're gonna be fine, okay, man?

35:02.267 --> 35:03.500
It's all right.

35:03.502 --> 35:05.669
I just...
I just gotta move you, okay?

35:05.671 --> 35:07.404
I'm sorry, it's gonna hurt.

35:11.143 --> 35:13.610
ED:
Bravo Team, gear up
for rappel descent.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.712
Stay out of the window and
prepare for flashbangs.

35:15.714 --> 35:18.348
There's no time.
Sam, we lost surprise--
a window distraction

35:18.350 --> 35:19.416
buys us a couple seconds.

35:23.489 --> 35:25.355
(groaning)

35:30.295 --> 35:31.695
(groaning)

35:38.203 --> 35:39.803
JULES:
Keenan's onto him.

35:39.805 --> 35:42.372
End of the road, Ed.

35:42.374 --> 35:44.241
Immediate action: Beta Plan.

35:44.243 --> 35:45.709
Sam, damn it!

35:45.711 --> 35:47.244
Keenan, listen to me.

35:47.246 --> 35:48.778
This is really
important now.

35:48.780 --> 35:50.313
Are you listening
to me?

35:51.250 --> 35:53.750
(gunfire)

35:53.752 --> 35:55.218
Greg, what's the story?

35:55.220 --> 35:56.820
Damn it, Sam,
hold formation.

35:56.822 --> 35:58.288
Hold formation!

35:59.258 --> 36:02.325
(gunfire)

36:03.829 --> 36:05.328
Damn it! Go, go, go!

36:05.330 --> 36:06.663
Go, go!

36:07.633 --> 36:09.299
(gunfire)

36:09.301 --> 36:10.300
Police! Get down!

36:10.302 --> 36:11.535
Hold your fire, officers.

36:11.537 --> 36:12.903
Unarmed subject.

36:12.905 --> 36:13.937
Get down on the floor!

36:13.939 --> 36:15.272
Get down!
Get down!

36:15.274 --> 36:17.207
Stay down!
Get his hands.

36:17.209 --> 36:18.575
Constable likes it rough.

36:18.577 --> 36:20.343
ED:
Clear!

36:21.280 --> 36:22.345
Wordy, how's Geddes?

36:22.347 --> 36:23.413
EMT.

36:23.415 --> 36:24.648
Get me an EMT!

36:24.650 --> 36:25.649
How's he doing?

36:25.651 --> 36:26.650
Jackson...

36:26.652 --> 36:28.518
Jackson, it's Ed.
(groaning)

36:28.520 --> 36:30.237
I got you, buddy.

36:30.238 --> 36:31.955
I got you, the paramedics
are just around the corner.

36:31.957 --> 36:33.657
I got you, you're gonna be okay.

36:33.659 --> 36:35.425
He's still breathing!

36:35.427 --> 36:37.527
Move your hands, move
your hands for me.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.431
You did it, you did it, buddy.
(moaning)

36:41.433 --> 36:42.632
You did it.

36:42.634 --> 36:44.601
You do those 12 steps,
you can do anything.

36:44.603 --> 36:46.203
You gotta just keep talking.

36:46.205 --> 36:47.537
That's it, you're gonna do fine,
just keep talking.

36:47.539 --> 36:49.439
You're fine,
just hang on.

36:49.441 --> 36:51.241
Just keep talking,
all right?

36:51.243 --> 36:52.876
You're okay,
you're gonna be okay.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.578
You'll be okay,
all right?

36:54.580 --> 36:56.379
Okay.
Ella...

36:56.381 --> 36:57.447
Who's Ella?

36:57.449 --> 36:59.382
Who's Ella, Jackson? Huh?

36:59.384 --> 37:01.384
She...

37:01.386 --> 37:03.386
She's such a goof.

37:03.388 --> 37:05.388
She...

37:05.390 --> 37:07.390
she makes me laugh.

37:07.392 --> 37:09.226
(panting)

37:09.228 --> 37:10.360
Jackson, bet
she's proud of you.

37:10.362 --> 37:11.728
Stay with me, Jackson.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.263
Jackson, who's Ella?

37:13.265 --> 37:14.998
Jackson, who's Ella?
Stay with me. Jackson?

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
(distant siren wailing)

37:17.002 --> 37:19.269
Jackson?

37:38.023 --> 37:40.023
Hey, easy.

37:40.025 --> 37:42.759
These guys said you're
gonna be fine, okay.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.361
I'm gonna call
Miriam myself.

37:44.363 --> 37:45.695
You don't worry
about a thing.

37:45.697 --> 37:47.364
Whoa!

37:47.366 --> 37:48.765
Okay, I gotta
go debrief.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.900
I'm gonna check in on you
as soon as we're done.

38:02.614 --> 38:03.813
Kevin, where you going?

38:04.783 --> 38:06.983
I don't know.

38:08.487 --> 38:10.520
That was messed up.

38:10.522 --> 38:12.522
I know.

38:12.524 --> 38:14.024
(siren wailing)

38:14.026 --> 38:15.425
You okay?

38:26.972 --> 38:28.972
Looks like Geddes
is gonna make it.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.507
Too bad about the kid.

38:32.477 --> 38:34.978
How else was it
going to end?

38:34.980 --> 38:37.013
I don't know.

38:37.015 --> 38:39.616
I don't know,
but that is not your call.

38:40.385 --> 38:42.452
Maybe I was wrong, Sam. Maybe.

38:42.454 --> 38:43.520
But I need to know

38:43.522 --> 38:45.855
that my team is
on my side.

38:46.925 --> 38:48.658
Then treat me like
I'm on your team.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.493
What?

38:50.495 --> 38:51.728
You want to know
what happened

38:51.730 --> 38:53.830
in Afghanistan?
Is that what this is about?

38:53.832 --> 38:56.066
I was taking out

38:56.068 --> 38:58.435
targets in a stronghold,
1500 meters away.

38:58.437 --> 39:01.438
The reccy was done,
I was cleared to fire.

39:01.440 --> 39:04.441
We went down to do the ID's.

39:04.443 --> 39:07.077
One of them was my buddy Matt.

39:07.079 --> 39:10.347
I was sniping
with a .50 cal.

39:12.084 --> 39:14.084
He shouldn't have
been there.

39:14.086 --> 39:15.485
I was cleared
to fire.

39:19.458 --> 39:22.559
You just had to ask.

39:24.529 --> 39:27.097
You go in on my command.

39:27.099 --> 39:28.965
You keep entry
formation,

39:28.967 --> 39:30.967
and you don't go in
without a shield.

39:30.969 --> 39:32.969
Are we clear?

39:32.971 --> 39:34.704
Sir.

39:56.061 --> 40:00.563
¶ But often it happens,
you know ¶

40:00.565 --> 40:03.900
¶ That the things
you don't trust ¶

40:03.902 --> 40:09.139
¶ Are the ones you need most ¶

40:10.976 --> 40:16.045
¶ It's cautiously
into the dark ¶

40:18.183 --> 40:25.455
¶ But you see before long
that your eyes will adjust ¶

40:27.492 --> 40:32.529
¶ And under the night
you can hear ¶

40:32.531 --> 40:39.602
¶ The full moon rise
like a psalm in the air ¶

40:42.040 --> 40:47.110
¶ And the air goes ¶
