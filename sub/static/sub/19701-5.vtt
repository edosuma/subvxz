WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:04.590
Right now, we need time and
privacy to come to terms

00:04.640 --> 00:06.630
with the shock of losing
two family members.

00:06.680 --> 00:09.230
Someone's sending me things. The
police have got this all wrong.

00:09.280 --> 00:10.270
I am the police.

00:10.320 --> 00:11.870
Tell me that you didn't know.

00:11.920 --> 00:13.230
What do I do?

00:13.280 --> 00:15.190
I'll deal with it.

00:15.240 --> 00:17.430
Steiner is the criminal. A
fucking murderer, George.

00:17.480 --> 00:20.510
- Why don't you believe me?
- Get off me!

00:20.560 --> 00:21.590
One...

00:21.640 --> 00:22.830
two...

00:22.880 --> 00:24.030
three.

00:24.080 --> 00:25.120
Why do you do it?

00:26.280 --> 00:27.910
Why do you find the bad people?

00:27.960 --> 00:29.790
Cos I'm like them.

00:29.840 --> 00:34.390
The others should know what being
Alistair's "top girl" really means.

00:34.440 --> 00:36.390
Maybe I can warn people.

00:36.440 --> 00:38.550
Get out.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.120
Get out before you're me.

I'm tired.

02:47.200 --> 02:48.190
Hey, Layla.

02:48.240 --> 02:50.550
Er, my pass is on the blink.
Can you buzz me through?

02:50.600 --> 02:51.910
Someone will be right down.

02:51.960 --> 02:53.510
It's fine, I'm due in today.

02:53.560 --> 02:55.710
Someone's just coming,
if you just take a seat...

02:55.760 --> 02:58.360
- Buzz me through, Layla.
- I can't, Holly. - Fuck!

03:04.160 --> 03:06.270
Holly...

03:06.320 --> 03:09.110
- Am I fired? - Just come and
sit down over here. - Am I?

03:09.160 --> 03:10.950
I mean, did you really
think you'd be kept on

03:11.000 --> 03:12.470
after the way you behaved?

03:12.520 --> 03:14.110
This is the fucking Gestapo.

03:14.160 --> 03:16.070
Lower your voice.

03:16.120 --> 03:17.990
No.

03:18.040 --> 03:20.070
You're out.

03:20.120 --> 03:22.830
OK? Show a little self-respect
and don't cause a scene.

03:22.880 --> 03:24.910
Get Rory down here now.

03:24.960 --> 03:26.510
I'm going to keep talking, Charlie.

03:26.560 --> 03:30.150
I'm going to keep going and I really
don't think you want me to do that.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.830
- Charlie?
- I'm fired.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.990
- Get her to calm down.
- Back off.

03:34.040 --> 03:35.080
Come here.

03:36.080 --> 03:37.950
You need to get her straight, mate.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.360
Fuck you, Charlie.

03:43.040 --> 03:45.390
- Rory... - Keep walking. - Stop.

03:45.440 --> 03:47.270
What are you doing? Hm?

03:47.320 --> 03:49.790
You promised me you were going
to keep a hold of yourself.

03:49.840 --> 03:51.350
It's too late.

03:51.400 --> 03:52.910
Well, it is now, yeah.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.070
Do you understand?

03:54.120 --> 03:56.710
Every time you make a scene,
you jeopardise everything.

03:56.760 --> 03:58.830
No, it's worse, you don't understand.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.600
- It's fucking worse!
- What?

04:01.680 --> 04:03.400
He sent me something else.

04:06.600 --> 04:07.920
Tell me.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.160
'Get out.

04:14.240 --> 04:15.720
'Get out before you're me.'

04:20.720 --> 04:21.800
I didn't know.

04:27.360 --> 04:28.870
I thought this was all about money.

04:28.920 --> 04:32.120
Money is just what makes them
believe they can do this.

04:34.680 --> 04:36.680
How quickly will they arrest them?

04:38.880 --> 04:40.750
Rory!

04:40.800 --> 04:43.630
These investigations take months, Holly.

04:43.680 --> 04:45.830
If the police and the FCA
can get everything lined up,

04:45.880 --> 04:48.150
they will take him down
forever. He'll go to prison.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.400
They are raping her.

04:50.720 --> 04:52.550
- She doesn't say that.
- She doesn't have to.

04:52.600 --> 04:55.390
I'm not saying it's not
horrific, but she doesn't resist.

04:55.440 --> 04:56.950
What is wrong with you?!

04:57.000 --> 04:59.360
I am trying to get you to be clever.

05:00.440 --> 05:03.470
Do you know that after your last
conversation with Alistair and Jude,

05:03.520 --> 05:07.070
Solasta's accounts the police
were watching just disappeared?

05:07.120 --> 05:10.310
That was evidence that YOU made disappear.

05:10.360 --> 05:13.670
Steiner's investments are
already being tidied up.

05:13.720 --> 05:17.110
You could destroy the whole case, Holly.

05:17.160 --> 05:18.670
Fay's dead.

05:18.720 --> 05:21.950
It's a rich man's word
against a dead girl's.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.630
Who do you think is going to win that one?

05:23.680 --> 05:25.180
I need to get Georgia out.

05:28.480 --> 05:29.800
He's hurting her.

05:31.040 --> 05:32.830
She's... She's...

05:36.320 --> 05:37.360
I know.

05:43.280 --> 05:44.880
Look, I've got it downloaded.

05:46.200 --> 05:47.520
I'm going to take it in.

05:57.360 --> 05:59.680
I need you to delete it from your e-mails.

06:01.080 --> 06:03.200
- Why?
- It's dangerous, Holly.

06:05.080 --> 06:08.160
I don't want anything to
lead back to you, understand?

06:09.280 --> 06:10.640
Let me take care of it.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.600
Did you make any copies?

06:27.760 --> 06:29.240
No.

07:11.960 --> 07:13.200
Knock-knock.

07:27.640 --> 07:28.800
Sleep-Eze?

07:32.880 --> 07:34.160
How many did you take?

07:40.400 --> 07:41.440
You're silly.

07:42.480 --> 07:43.520
You need to get up.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.270
I've got the day off.

07:46.320 --> 07:48.070
Jude wants to see you.

07:48.120 --> 07:50.230
I don't work for Jude.

07:50.280 --> 07:51.600
Come on, I'll help you.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.120
I'm not going, Phoebe.

08:03.120 --> 08:04.160
Come on.

08:05.480 --> 08:07.000
Here we go. Arms up.

08:21.280 --> 08:23.360
I don't think that's your job, Jude.

08:25.160 --> 08:26.630
Do you want to give me a hand?

08:26.680 --> 08:28.510
It's definitely not my job.

08:28.560 --> 08:29.760
Fair enough.

08:33.960 --> 08:37.390
I was wanting to check in
with you about the other night.

08:37.440 --> 08:38.679
I'm OK.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.870
I hear you did a fantastic
job with Steiner.

08:47.920 --> 08:49.670
Well done for keeping your head.

08:49.720 --> 08:52.470
Not sure I would've managed all
those investment protocols.

08:52.520 --> 08:53.550
Yeah, well...

08:53.600 --> 08:55.830
it's the other stuff I'm good at.

08:55.880 --> 08:57.510
Other stuff?

08:57.560 --> 08:58.590
Mm.

08:58.640 --> 09:00.920
You mean the corporate entertainment?

09:02.440 --> 09:03.670
Yeah.

09:03.720 --> 09:05.000
"Entertainment."

09:07.200 --> 09:08.560
It's like you said.

09:09.600 --> 09:13.040
Once you get over yourself, it
doesn't need to be a huge deal.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.230
What I said?

09:16.280 --> 09:17.750
What you taught me.

09:17.800 --> 09:20.080
Use what you've got. Like the men do.

09:22.920 --> 09:24.040
I get it now.

09:25.160 --> 09:27.230
Steiner was...

09:27.280 --> 09:30.670
It messed with my head for
a bit, but I'm good now.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.750
Holly will never get that.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.360
She's not ambitious.

09:39.240 --> 09:40.320
Jude.

09:43.520 --> 09:44.560
Ouchie.

09:49.240 --> 09:50.510
'He wasn't like them.

09:50.560 --> 09:53.510
'He made me feel maybe I wasn't either.

09:53.560 --> 09:57.150
'I think I could've taken
it if it was just me.

09:57.200 --> 09:58.390
'And James...'

10:17.120 --> 10:19.790
'Maybe I can warn people.

10:19.840 --> 10:21.950
'Maybe I can do this one thing.

10:30.600 --> 10:31.800
Where is this place?

10:32.840 --> 10:34.000
You know, don't you?

10:36.320 --> 10:37.480
Please, Mo.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.520
Jude.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.800
Hi, what are you doing down here?

11:21.240 --> 11:24.910
Just... enjoying this
beautiful city of mine.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.750
You fancy a drink?

11:26.800 --> 11:30.470
I actually came to ask you...
to leave my brother alone

11:30.520 --> 11:32.110
and to stay away from my girls.

11:32.160 --> 11:33.390
Oh, really?

11:33.440 --> 11:36.240
Yeah, well, maybe not
ask, maybe just tell.

11:37.240 --> 11:38.750
Wow.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.830
You certainly know how to
make a man feel special.

11:41.880 --> 11:43.680
I know who you are, Florian.

11:47.520 --> 11:50.710
I'm choosing to believe this
is your idea of a joke, Jude.

11:50.760 --> 11:53.710
It's not a very funny joke, is it?

11:53.760 --> 11:56.160
Well, then you should
be very, very careful.

11:58.040 --> 12:00.070
My brother's always got
himself into trouble.

12:00.120 --> 12:03.030
He's careless. It's my
job to look after him.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.350
Alistair can look after himself.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.590
He looks after himself very well indeed.

12:07.640 --> 12:10.480
Take your money and get
the fuck away from us.

12:17.920 --> 12:20.400
You are a jumped up
little cunt, aren't you?

12:22.880 --> 12:24.760
That really the best you've got?

13:02.880 --> 13:06.430
It was their place, Fay and James.

13:06.480 --> 13:08.280
They told me to keep it a secret.

13:11.080 --> 13:14.240
They used to leave each
other messages in my car.

13:18.080 --> 13:19.480
I kept it safe for them.

13:21.880 --> 13:24.200
The only thing Alistair couldn't touch.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.560
It's the only thing that's left.

13:31.320 --> 13:32.600
She was happy.

13:34.160 --> 13:35.880
James made her happy.

13:38.040 --> 13:40.800
I think that's why she
didn't kill herself here.

13:42.040 --> 13:44.480
She didn't want him to find her.

13:50.240 --> 13:51.560
I was so scared.

13:55.680 --> 13:57.200
But then you were there.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.360
I thought we had saved her.

14:03.720 --> 14:05.120
I thought...

14:13.200 --> 14:15.120
You did everything you could, Mo.

14:18.840 --> 14:20.800
And she still died.

14:24.440 --> 14:26.350
'They make you feel just like them.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.480
'Just as bad, just as dirty.'

14:32.080 --> 14:33.600
We need to go to the police.

14:34.720 --> 14:36.990
I already have, sort of.

14:37.040 --> 14:38.790
What do you mean?

14:38.840 --> 14:41.750
They're investigating
Alistair and Steiner for fraud.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.230
They told you that?

14:43.280 --> 14:46.350
But they didn't know what
happened to Fay, so I...

14:46.400 --> 14:48.470
I made sure that they'll see that.

14:48.520 --> 14:50.990
- Did you make a statement?
- No, it's not like that.

14:51.040 --> 14:53.590
- Well, what did they say?
- I can't explain it.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.080
Holly, tell me the truth.

15:01.640 --> 15:03.950
There's someone on the inside.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.160
Inside Solasta?

15:06.200 --> 15:07.360
Who?

15:10.480 --> 15:11.760
Rory.

15:13.760 --> 15:15.670
I knew there was something.

15:15.720 --> 15:16.760
Oh, my God.

15:18.520 --> 15:19.760
I know.

15:21.480 --> 15:23.950
So they're already on Alistair?

15:24.000 --> 15:26.830
We have to wait for them to
pull the trigger on their case.

15:26.880 --> 15:29.200
- For how long?
- I don't know.

15:30.200 --> 15:31.630
What about Georgia?

15:31.680 --> 15:33.510
She wants nothing to do with me.

15:33.560 --> 15:35.470
Rory's made me promise
not to say anything,

15:35.520 --> 15:38.230
I could destroy the whole investigation.

15:38.280 --> 15:39.560
But it's Georgia.

15:46.840 --> 15:48.960
You're shit at snooping, Elizabeth.

15:50.960 --> 15:52.950
I don't think standing
outside your own bedroom

15:53.000 --> 15:54.750
can be considered snooping.

15:55.300 --> 15:56.300
What did you hear?

15:56.640 --> 15:58.590
That your boyfriend works for the police

15:58.640 --> 16:01.470
and that you're thinking of
ignoring his direct advice.

16:01.520 --> 16:02.640
She's seen it.

16:03.640 --> 16:07.040
We were friends long before
you came along, Rachel Maddox.

16:08.480 --> 16:11.520
We can still fix this,
even if we wait for Rory.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.160
What are you doing?

16:15.960 --> 16:18.390
- Georgia, hi, darling, it's me.
- 'Hey, Rach.'

16:18.440 --> 16:21.710
Alistair wants to know if you
can meet for lunch at two?

16:21.760 --> 16:23.190
'Today?'

16:23.240 --> 16:25.790
Yeah, today. Today at two.

16:25.840 --> 16:26.950
'Where?'

16:27.000 --> 16:28.910
Usual place.

16:28.960 --> 16:30.070
'OK.'

16:30.120 --> 16:31.430
OK, perfect. I'll send a car.

16:31.480 --> 16:32.510
'Thanks.'

16:32.560 --> 16:33.680
See you later, bye.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.240
"The usual place"?

16:40.200 --> 16:43.240
They've been meeting up
a lot outside of work.

16:54.680 --> 16:55.920
You bitch.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.160
I had no choice.

16:59.720 --> 17:00.920
What do you want?

17:05.000 --> 17:06.160
I, um...

17:08.640 --> 17:11.240
I want to talk about
what's really happening.

17:14.079 --> 17:15.589
Which is?

17:15.640 --> 17:16.960
That you were raped.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.280
That you're being raped.

17:23.720 --> 17:26.680
I think I get to decide
if I was raped, Holly.

17:28.160 --> 17:31.430
You're constructing a story
around what's happening.

17:31.480 --> 17:33.710
No, it's what I decide it is.

17:33.760 --> 17:35.150
OK?

17:35.200 --> 17:36.670
It's my choice.

17:36.720 --> 17:38.320
It will eat you up, Georgia.

17:41.240 --> 17:42.400
Yeah, well...

17:44.200 --> 17:46.600
.. we all have things
to keep inside, Holly.

17:47.880 --> 17:48.960
Secrets.

17:51.920 --> 17:54.620
Have you forgotten about
the little dead girl?

18:01.520 --> 18:02.870
Did you think I didn't hear

18:02.920 --> 18:06.350
what the kids at school
were saying about you?

18:06.400 --> 18:09.110
They said you were evil, Holly.

18:09.160 --> 18:11.350
Rotten inside. A monster.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.670
That's how I felt.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.680
And I never made you explain.

18:18.520 --> 18:19.720
Because I loved you.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.640
Because we were best mates.

18:23.680 --> 18:24.960
You saved me.

18:28.360 --> 18:30.660
But we still love each other, Georgia...

18:33.760 --> 18:36.430
Then do this for me. Just...

18:36.480 --> 18:38.350
leave it alone, just leave me alone.

18:38.400 --> 18:39.960
I can't.

18:43.800 --> 18:45.590
Then it's broken.

18:45.640 --> 18:47.280
This is broken.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.840
And I'll make you stop.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.270
I was a kid.

18:55.320 --> 18:56.680
But it was my fault.

18:59.760 --> 19:01.360
This is not your fault.

19:27.240 --> 19:28.600
(Come back.)

19:30.840 --> 19:34.680
(Come back. Come back.)

19:43.880 --> 19:47.470
(Come back. Come back.)

19:47.520 --> 19:48.720
(I'm sorry.)

19:50.760 --> 19:52.080
(I'm sorry.)

19:57.120 --> 19:59.350
Maybe you need to let her go.

19:59.400 --> 20:00.840
Stop trying to save her.

20:02.840 --> 20:04.360
I don't know how to do that.

20:05.360 --> 20:07.150
You're doing it.

20:07.200 --> 20:08.360
You're here with me.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.940
This is bigger than Georgia.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.480
- We can fix it.
- How?

20:19.240 --> 20:20.760
Tell the truth.

20:31.720 --> 20:33.950
- Welcome to Solasta.
- Nope.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.670
No.

20:35.720 --> 20:37.000
Maybe?

20:38.520 --> 20:40.400
Oh, God, absolutely not.

20:41.680 --> 20:44.830
Nice to see your judgment remains
entirely appearance based.

20:44.880 --> 20:47.670
Not at all, I'm a fantastic
judge of character.

20:47.720 --> 20:50.320
What did you think of me
when you first met me?

20:51.520 --> 20:53.110
I thought...

20:53.160 --> 20:54.670
"Wow.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.240
"What a special snowflake."

20:59.000 --> 21:00.440
They look young.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.190
They look younger than before, don't they?

21:04.240 --> 21:06.230
They really should serve
booze at these things.

21:06.280 --> 21:09.150
I was 17 when I came to this open day,

21:09.200 --> 21:10.600
listened to you talk...

21:11.560 --> 21:15.230
.. made Edinburgh my first
choice that same night.

21:15.280 --> 21:16.640
And here we are.

21:46.920 --> 21:48.080
Alistair!

21:51.000 --> 21:52.280
We need to start.

22:12.600 --> 22:14.360
Welcome, everyone.

22:16.200 --> 22:17.790
I just want to say a few words

22:17.840 --> 22:20.310
before I get Professor McDermid up here

22:20.360 --> 22:22.560
to give you a better idea of what we do.

22:24.160 --> 22:27.560
This is the fourth year of the
Solasta Women's Initiative.

22:28.560 --> 22:31.960
It was created for a very simple reason.

22:33.240 --> 22:35.790
My business benefits
from a female workforce,

22:35.840 --> 22:39.670
but somehow something makes that a
little bit more difficult to achieve

22:39.720 --> 22:41.350
than it should be.

22:41.400 --> 22:46.030
If Solasta can play even a small
role in correcting that imbalance,

22:46.080 --> 22:47.390
then I'm over the moon.

22:47.440 --> 22:50.310
I mean, some of the most
exciting people working for me

22:50.360 --> 22:52.950
came directly from this initiative, so...

22:53.000 --> 22:56.510
I look forward to seeing some
of your faces in the future.

22:56.560 --> 22:57.600
Professor?

23:02.720 --> 23:05.630
Thank you all so much for coming.

23:05.680 --> 23:09.430
It is fantastic to see so
many of you already engaging

23:09.480 --> 23:12.230
with the importance of making the
most of your time at university.

23:12.280 --> 23:14.790
- You are nice. - I would like
to start... - You are brave.

23:14.840 --> 23:16.470
.. by giving you an idea

23:16.520 --> 23:19.220
of what Solasta Women's
Initiative aims to do.

23:28.400 --> 23:29.760
And...

23:39.560 --> 23:41.190
Excuse me, just one sec...

23:41.240 --> 23:43.270
'Alistair is clever.

23:43.320 --> 23:45.150
'Like always, he was one step ahead.

23:45.200 --> 23:49.070
'Once he knew what we were
planning to do, he acted fast.

23:49.120 --> 23:50.670
'Just like that...

23:50.720 --> 23:53.990
'the whole thing comes
back to me and James.

23:54.040 --> 23:56.310
- 'Every deal, every short cut...'
- (What the fuck is this?!)

23:56.360 --> 23:58.990
'.. every illegal, disgusting, greedy act

23:59.040 --> 24:00.960
'is now in my name and in James'.

24:02.160 --> 24:06.670
'Jude McDermid offers a
bespoke service for us girls.

24:06.720 --> 24:10.230
'Our talents are tested so we can
be placed into the right department.

24:10.280 --> 24:14.870
'But there's an extra test for you
if you're after client management.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.710
'That's the special one.'

24:18.840 --> 24:20.640
'But the others should know...

24:22.000 --> 24:26.750
'The others should know what being
Alistair's "top girl" really means.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.950
'How they make you feel just like them...

24:29.000 --> 24:31.560
'.. just as bad, just as dirty.'

25:19.440 --> 25:21.070
We did it.

25:21.120 --> 25:23.830
It's everywhere. God,
it's already everywhere.

25:23.880 --> 25:24.920
Guys...

25:31.600 --> 25:33.990
I'm going to limit this to the facts.

25:34.040 --> 25:38.710
I have never sexually assaulted a
woman who works for me or otherwise.

25:38.760 --> 25:41.670
I know who I am, as do my
family, friends and colleagues,

25:41.720 --> 25:43.830
and it's not the man
that's been suggested.

25:43.880 --> 25:46.670
The police have reviewed the facts
and come to the same conclusion.

25:46.720 --> 25:48.320
I would ask the media...

26:12.200 --> 26:15.120
My solicitor said it would
be best to come here.

26:24.880 --> 26:26.680
Are you going to say anything?

26:28.280 --> 26:30.580
I spent my life thinking the best of you.

26:32.600 --> 26:34.430
Jude...

26:34.480 --> 26:35.800
You made a fool of me.

26:38.920 --> 26:41.800
You made me believe that you were good.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.870
Nothing's changed.

26:45.920 --> 26:48.870
"Nothing's changed"?!
You're a fucking rapist!

26:48.920 --> 26:51.270
I had consensual sex.

26:51.320 --> 26:54.790
Oh, what is wrong with you?

26:54.840 --> 26:57.560
Jude! I didn't rape her.

26:58.720 --> 27:01.070
Why don't you believe me?
You're my fucking sister!

27:01.120 --> 27:02.480
And that means what?

27:04.520 --> 27:07.870
You've bred this little tribe

27:07.920 --> 27:12.320
of nasty, jumped-up,
backstabbing little bitches.

27:18.560 --> 27:23.230
Fay wanted to tell the
truth about you and you...

27:23.280 --> 27:25.280
made her believe she had no way out.

27:27.320 --> 27:32.320
I can't be responsible for every
mad impulse an unstable woman has.

27:33.320 --> 27:34.360
Oh...

27:36.520 --> 27:40.470
Rachel knew she was nuts, she
warned me what Fay was planning.

27:40.520 --> 27:41.910
You can't stop lying, can you?

27:41.960 --> 27:43.710
- Jude.
- Why don't you just stop?

27:43.760 --> 27:45.080
Jude! Please.

27:47.240 --> 27:49.080
Get... out.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.960
I've fucked some girls, Jude.

27:59.800 --> 28:00.840
You knew.

28:02.280 --> 28:04.380
We were both getting what we wanted.

28:18.840 --> 28:20.080
It was you, too, Jude.

28:22.160 --> 28:23.660
You helped me build this.

28:29.920 --> 28:32.710
'I know who I am, as do my
family, friends and colleagues,

28:32.760 --> 28:34.470
'and it's not the man
that's been suggested.

28:34.520 --> 28:37.350
'The police have reviewed the facts
and come to the same conclusion.

28:37.400 --> 28:40.030
'I would ask the media
to attempt to do the same.

28:40.080 --> 28:43.030
'A good story doesn't equal a true one.

28:43.080 --> 28:43.710
'Thank you.'

28:45.160 --> 28:46.680
Nothing's happening.

28:47.880 --> 28:51.830
'Alistair McDermid is a
fantastic boss and a gentleman.

28:51.880 --> 28:53.950
'These accusations are ridiculous.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.960
'It's very easy to ruin a
man's life with a simple lie.

28:58.560 --> 29:00.750
'I'd like everyone to
know that the man I know

29:00.800 --> 29:03.630
'is not capable of what they're claiming.

29:03.680 --> 29:05.080
'He helps women achieve.

29:06.640 --> 29:09.470
'I think it's a shame that that
immediately brings distrust

29:09.520 --> 29:11.280
'and judgment down on you.'

29:12.320 --> 29:13.360
It didn't work.

29:14.800 --> 29:17.630
He's going to get away
with it. They're not...

29:17.680 --> 29:19.600
They're not going to do anything.

29:26.520 --> 29:27.560
Holly.

29:34.160 --> 29:36.470
I'm going back to halls, I
just want to go to sleep.

29:36.520 --> 29:38.790
Do you have any idea what you've done?

29:38.840 --> 29:40.560
You can't go back to halls, OK?

29:41.640 --> 29:42.680
Come on.

29:53.680 --> 29:54.840
Where have you been?

29:55.920 --> 29:57.280
Nowhere.

29:58.920 --> 30:02.640
So are you going to tell us what
this is about now Queen Bee is here?

30:04.400 --> 30:06.670
We are shutting down the house.

30:08.360 --> 30:09.680
Isn't that wonderful(?)

30:10.680 --> 30:14.830
I'm sure you've all got a lot of
questions, feel very betrayed.

30:14.880 --> 30:15.950
I know I do.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.150
Why would Fay do that? Try
and set him up like that?

30:19.200 --> 30:21.510
- You don't know what happened.
- Well, I know she was messed up.

30:21.560 --> 30:22.950
Yeah, and for what reason?

30:23.000 --> 30:24.630
- She was...
- Stop it. We're not doing this,

30:24.680 --> 30:26.270
we're not sitting here and speculating.

30:26.320 --> 30:27.590
I think it's exactly the time

30:27.640 --> 30:29.390
to start asking a few questions, actually.

30:29.440 --> 30:31.830
Seems to me Holly's the
only one thinking clearly.

30:31.880 --> 30:33.110
Holly's naive.

30:33.160 --> 30:34.710
She doesn't understand any of this.

30:34.760 --> 30:35.800
Thank you.

30:37.600 --> 30:38.800
Fuck this.

30:40.560 --> 30:41.720
Louise, wait.

30:45.840 --> 30:46.880
Anything else?

31:05.120 --> 31:07.150
We used to talk, you and me.

31:07.200 --> 31:08.790
You use to tell me things.

31:08.840 --> 31:10.310
Things change.

31:10.360 --> 31:12.310
Yes, they did.

31:12.360 --> 31:14.070
Suddenly you're just
talking to my brother.

31:14.120 --> 31:16.320
You mean doing the job you set me up for?

31:18.200 --> 31:21.400
He said that you were doing
more than just your job.

31:22.640 --> 31:25.230
He said that you told him Fay and James

31:25.280 --> 31:27.910
were going to expose him
and Steiner, but that's...

31:27.960 --> 31:29.400
That's a lie, isn't it?

31:31.520 --> 31:33.420
Everyone had their game to play.

31:34.800 --> 31:36.430
Rachel.

31:36.480 --> 31:38.470
It's over, Jude.

31:38.520 --> 31:39.920
Surely you can see that.

31:41.040 --> 31:44.480
You couldn't keep up. Now things
are happening without you.

31:46.080 --> 31:48.240
I don't know you at all, do I?

31:53.880 --> 31:55.510
What are you doing?

31:55.560 --> 31:56.640
Bye, Professor.

32:07.200 --> 32:08.320
Rory, talk to me.

32:10.760 --> 32:11.800
Rory?

32:13.360 --> 32:16.390
- What are you doing?
- I'll go and get your stuff from halls later.

32:16.440 --> 32:17.630
What?

32:17.680 --> 32:19.550
- You need to leave.
- I'm not going anywhere.

32:19.600 --> 32:22.750
He's going to come for
you now. Do you get that?

32:22.800 --> 32:24.510
You played the wrong hand, it didn't work.

32:24.560 --> 32:26.430
Somebody needed to act.

32:26.480 --> 32:28.350
Why haven't the police arrested him yet?

32:28.400 --> 32:31.350
You... You gave them everything, right?

32:31.400 --> 32:33.470
- My phone?
- Of course I did.

32:33.520 --> 32:36.430
Then why is nothing happening?
Why is he still walking around?

32:36.480 --> 32:38.520
I don't think you understand.

32:39.880 --> 32:42.510
Fay and James had a place. Maybe
there's stuff there, evidence.

32:42.560 --> 32:45.670
- Maybe we can still go...
- What-what place? - I didn't tell you.

32:45.720 --> 32:47.390
It was their secret.

32:47.440 --> 32:49.350
Where?

32:49.400 --> 32:51.000
Tyrell Street, on the water.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.480
- I-I can show you.
- No.

32:56.040 --> 32:57.640
It doesn't matter any more.

32:59.040 --> 33:00.590
I thought maybe we could find something

33:00.640 --> 33:01.990
that will prove that Alistair...

33:02.040 --> 33:05.430
It won't matter. For fuck's
sake, Holly, he's protected.

33:05.480 --> 33:06.510
By who?

33:06.560 --> 33:09.510
Businesspeople, politicians, the police.

33:09.560 --> 33:11.230
He has friends everywhere.

33:11.280 --> 33:13.310
You're insane, you...

33:13.360 --> 33:15.270
You said that they were
close to arresting him.

33:15.320 --> 33:16.470
You're not making any sense.

33:16.520 --> 33:18.400
He will fucking kill you, Holly!

33:26.880 --> 33:28.240
Let me keep you safe.

33:31.480 --> 33:32.800
Do you understand?

33:35.760 --> 33:36.880
Do you understand?

33:43.960 --> 33:48.070
I am going to go get your stuff
from halls, wait for me here.

33:48.120 --> 33:49.640
When I come back, we can go.

33:55.080 --> 33:56.200
I love you.

34:14.159 --> 34:15.350
'I need your phone.

34:15.400 --> 34:18.270
'I need to trace where they're
sending you this stuff.'

34:18.320 --> 34:19.830
'You gave them everything, right?'

34:19.880 --> 34:20.920
'Course I did.'

35:49.160 --> 35:51.750
- Hi.
- She's not here.

35:51.800 --> 35:53.550
Do you know where she went?

35:53.600 --> 35:54.640
No.

35:56.480 --> 35:57.640
No worries.

36:01.840 --> 36:03.160
I'm worried about her.

36:04.400 --> 36:06.470
She shouldn't be out, right?

36:06.520 --> 36:08.990
Holly's pretty good at
taking care of herself.

36:09.040 --> 36:10.960
She could be in actual danger.

36:12.120 --> 36:13.360
Maybe she likes it.

36:20.280 --> 36:22.310
- Holly?
- Rachel, I need you to help me.

36:22.360 --> 36:24.070
OK, calm down. Where are you?

36:24.120 --> 36:25.270
I'm at Rory's.

36:25.320 --> 36:28.070
Everything is still here, he
hasn't given anything to the police.

36:28.120 --> 36:30.310
I don't even know if there
IS an investigation.

36:30.360 --> 36:31.990
I don't know who he is.

36:32.040 --> 36:33.160
You need to get out.

36:34.160 --> 36:36.270
I think... I think I know where he's gone.

36:36.320 --> 36:38.590
They had a place, Fay and James.

36:38.640 --> 36:40.150
Stay where you are. Don't go over.

36:40.200 --> 36:42.680
I need to know. I need to know.

38:01.840 --> 38:03.240
What are you doing here?

38:07.080 --> 38:09.560
You never gave them the things I was sent.

38:10.800 --> 38:12.590
The things I handed over to you.

38:12.640 --> 38:15.880
- Whatever you're thinking,
you've got it wrong. - Did you?

38:18.480 --> 38:19.520
No.

38:23.200 --> 38:24.440
The police aren't...

38:25.720 --> 38:27.880
.. coming for Alistair, are they?

38:29.640 --> 38:30.680
I love you.

38:31.880 --> 38:33.080
Don't do this.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.520
I think I could've loved you, too.

38:41.080 --> 38:43.070
So stop, we don't need
to have this conversation.

38:43.120 --> 38:44.710
- Too late.
- No, no, no, it isn't.

38:44.760 --> 38:47.470
We can go, we can go right
now and we can start again.

38:47.520 --> 38:49.440
You're going to tell me the truth.

38:53.800 --> 38:55.800
You're going to tell me who you are.

38:57.520 --> 38:59.920
You know the bits that
matter, you know me.

39:03.840 --> 39:05.240
You belong to Alistair.

39:10.600 --> 39:11.760
Oh, my God.

39:13.120 --> 39:14.630
Oh, my God.

39:14.680 --> 39:16.880
I was trying to build a life for myself.

39:18.120 --> 39:20.240
Th-the police weren't going to move.

39:21.280 --> 39:23.870
Everyone around me was
progressing, I just wanted...

39:23.920 --> 39:25.590
You wanted in.

39:25.640 --> 39:28.430
I just wanted something for myself, Holly.

39:28.480 --> 39:30.070
Do you have any idea what that feels like?

39:30.120 --> 39:32.030
I just wanted something for myself.

39:32.080 --> 39:34.710
So you went to Alistair, you told him.

39:34.760 --> 39:36.950
I let him know about the
police investigation.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.510
Let him know where they were looking.

39:39.560 --> 39:40.880
And got what in return?

39:44.440 --> 39:45.680
Money?

39:49.520 --> 39:51.320
Oh, this is all about money?

39:53.080 --> 39:55.640
I didn't know any of
this was going to happen.

39:56.760 --> 39:58.760
I didn't know Fay and James would...

40:00.480 --> 40:01.880
James wouldn't stop.

40:03.520 --> 40:06.160
After Fay died, he wanted revenge.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.190
I tried to make him stop.

40:10.240 --> 40:13.160
Hey, please believe me,
I tried to make him stop.

40:14.880 --> 40:15.920
Did you...?

40:17.720 --> 40:19.240
Did you kill him, Rory?

40:24.640 --> 40:27.840
He was going to bring the whole
thing down, and me with it.

40:30.560 --> 40:33.670
I didn't know who Alistair was, who he is,

40:33.720 --> 40:36.920
I didn't know what he had done to Fay.

40:38.400 --> 40:40.200
I never wanted to kill James.

40:41.320 --> 40:44.550
It all happened so fast,
like it hadn't happened,

40:44.600 --> 40:47.240
like I'd made it up, like I was dreaming!

40:48.440 --> 40:50.360
Fay didn't kill herself, did she?

40:52.080 --> 40:53.400
You killed her, too.

40:54.880 --> 40:55.870
No.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.110
You're a liar.

40:57.160 --> 40:59.670
No, Holly, you know me, you know me!

40:59.720 --> 41:01.430
Please, hey?

41:01.480 --> 41:03.710
We can get out of here,
we can make for it.

41:03.760 --> 41:04.800
No.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.590
I-I...

41:11.840 --> 41:14.230
I told you to stop, why
couldn't you just stop?

41:14.280 --> 41:16.470
- Let me go.
- No.

41:16.520 --> 41:18.470
I told you to wait in the
flat, I told you to...

41:18.520 --> 41:19.600
LET ME GO!

41:31.000 --> 41:32.400
What are you going to do?

41:34.360 --> 41:36.960
Hey, please, talk...
Just talk to me, please.

41:38.160 --> 41:39.240
Let me leave.

41:44.200 --> 41:47.120
You can't. You CAN'T!

41:50.120 --> 41:51.010
Holly...

41:52.560 --> 41:55.030
No, Holly, please, shush! Shush!

41:58.280 --> 42:00.590
Shush! Please, shush!

42:00.640 --> 42:02.110
Help me!

42:02.160 --> 42:03.200
Holly...

42:04.840 --> 42:06.990
Shh... Please, shush!

42:07.040 --> 42:09.320
- Stop it!
- I told you to stop.

42:12.240 --> 42:14.160
You could have just left it alone!

42:48.000 --> 42:49.040
Stop it.

42:55.680 --> 42:57.160
Stop it!
