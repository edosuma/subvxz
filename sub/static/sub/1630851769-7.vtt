00:13.471 --> 00:15.932
- A new door opened
because of me.

00:15.974 --> 00:17.642
I need the ledger
to help me close it.

00:17.684 --> 00:19.894
- Once the new door is closed,
what then?

00:19.936 --> 00:20.937
- I'll return.

00:20.979 --> 00:22.022
- That's gold, Kal.

00:22.063 --> 00:23.189
- Keep access tight.

00:26.067 --> 00:27.527
- Fuck my life.

00:27.569 --> 00:29.946
- Kill it! Kill it!

00:29.988 --> 00:32.407
- Tasha, look, they're human.

00:32.449 --> 00:34.492
- Why did you abandon us?

00:34.534 --> 00:37.287
- I should rip your heart out
and throw it to the Herd.

00:37.328 --> 00:39.372
- But then I couldn't
make things right.

00:42.417 --> 00:47.714
- Gotta make it stop.

00:47.756 --> 00:50.300
- Make it stop.

00:50.342 --> 00:52.218
Make it stop.

00:56.598 --> 00:59.225
- Make it stop.
- Make it stop!

01:13.698 --> 01:16.368
- Carrie.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.295
- Mom?

01:30.924 --> 01:32.759
- You know what to do.

01:35.470 --> 01:38.973
Find me in Salem
and I'll make it all stop.

01:39.015 --> 01:41.434
You need rest, dear.

01:41.476 --> 01:46.356
The pain, the loneliness,

01:46.398 --> 01:48.942
the unending noise.

01:51.861 --> 01:54.364
You'll be home.

02:10.338 --> 02:14.259
Open that door,
then find me.

02:15.677 --> 02:18.304
- It was locked.

02:18.346 --> 02:21.850
- But someone has the key.

02:28.815 --> 02:31.985
- Disciples,
don't let anything pass.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.698
You know the drill.

03:00.138 --> 03:03.183
- Thank you.

03:14.152 --> 03:15.904
- Carrie, what are you doing?

03:23.536 --> 03:26.414
- Ah!

03:27.248 --> 03:28.875
- Shh.
They'll hear you.

03:43.807 --> 03:45.183
- No!

04:22.929 --> 04:25.807
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!

05:26.910 --> 05:29.120
- That snails really
lasering into us.

05:33.041 --> 05:36.044
- I cause so much death.

05:36.086 --> 05:39.506
- That thing was going to
cut my head clean off.

05:39.547 --> 05:42.842
You're my hero.
- She could have been saved.

05:42.884 --> 05:44.010
- Hallelujah.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.680
One step from Bible study
and bake sales.

05:46.721 --> 05:49.057
- No, really,
she could have been saved.

05:49.099 --> 05:52.435
I understand her.

05:52.477 --> 05:56.523
My whole life,
I felt like this cockroach,

05:56.564 --> 05:58.983
so when someone treated me,
you know, I--

05:59.025 --> 06:01.986
good or--
I don't know, what's the word?

06:02.028 --> 06:05.031
- With, like, kindness?
- Trust?

06:05.073 --> 06:07.617
I was theirs.

06:07.659 --> 06:10.870
I cheated my way
into the position of Guardian.

06:10.912 --> 06:16.042
Thought I'll play the hero,
win love.

06:16.084 --> 06:19.796
Johannes showed me
I'm a selfish nothing.

06:19.838 --> 06:22.966
Carrie Ecker,
the disappointment.

06:23.008 --> 06:26.511
I began to think,
I'm so worthless.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.304
Doesn't everybody?

06:28.346 --> 06:33.184
I ate its hatred like fruit.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.728
- We all have selfish thoughts.

06:34.769 --> 06:37.856
You are the strongest,
most loyal person I know.

06:37.897 --> 06:40.442
- You don't know what I did.
- Try me.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.736
- You'll hate me.
- Try me.

06:42.777 --> 06:47.407
- I let out the beast
that started this.

06:47.449 --> 06:51.494
All of those dead.

06:51.536 --> 06:53.538
I was unwell, but...

06:58.626 --> 07:00.962
I thought
the world deserved it.

07:03.214 --> 07:06.009
- Those fuckers put a child

07:06.051 --> 07:07.761
in charge of guarding
the gate to hell.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.012
- Innocence is a virtue.

07:09.054 --> 07:10.430
- You know what
my responsibilities are?

07:10.472 --> 07:12.390
Like, literally,
just the dishes,

07:12.432 --> 07:14.934
and I can't even do that.
It's so boring. Oh, my God.

07:14.976 --> 07:17.937
I make sandwiches because,
voila, no dishes.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.231
- If someone came to me
and was like,

07:20.273 --> 07:22.484
"Tasha, guard
the literal gate to hell."

07:22.525 --> 07:23.693
Minutes.

07:23.735 --> 07:26.780
- Yeah, it's not true.
- Girl, yes.

07:26.821 --> 07:29.616
My mom saw that
and then, poof, dead.

07:29.657 --> 07:33.203
So you're right.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.622
Maybe everything can heal.

07:35.663 --> 07:37.457
We're working on it.

07:37.499 --> 07:41.127
- Okay, good.

07:41.169 --> 07:45.215
Because I got
what I went back for.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.549
Let's close the tear.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.137
- Brolan.

07:51.179 --> 07:54.516
- Tasha, Tasha--I--
something's wrong--

07:54.557 --> 07:55.934
- Slow down.
- I can't, I--

07:55.975 --> 07:57.769
- I think he's have a bad trip.

08:12.909 --> 08:15.995
- Oh shit, shit, shit.

08:16.037 --> 08:18.665
Acid flashbacks.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.178
Weird puberty.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.350
Shit.

08:37.392 --> 08:38.727
Shit, shit.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.860
Not my fucking hair.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.946
- You stay here,
I'll go check on Nolan.

08:49.988 --> 08:52.657
Dad keeps all his WPN stuff
in a locked filing cabinet.

08:52.699 --> 08:53.908
- Okay.

08:53.950 --> 08:54.993
- The key is in
the beer money box.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.578
- Okay.

08:56.619 --> 08:57.871
I'll have a plan to close the
tear by the time you get back.

08:57.912 --> 08:59.664
- I'll ask Nolan to come too.
- Good.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.708
We're going to need
all the help we can get.

09:01.750 --> 09:04.502
Just be safe, Tashie.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.588
- Tashie?
- What?

09:06.629 --> 09:08.506
- Carrie, are you
doing nicknames now?

09:08.548 --> 09:10.050
- What?
No, be quiet.

09:10.091 --> 09:12.761
- Oh, my God.
Care Bear, I'm so proud of you.

09:12.802 --> 09:13.970
- Oh, sorry.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.388
Sorry, I thought we were--
- Well, no, wait.

09:15.430 --> 09:16.556
Are we hugging?

09:16.598 --> 09:18.016
- Go this way.
- Yeah.

09:19.934 --> 09:21.561
- Pickles.
- Sandalwood.

09:21.603 --> 09:22.729
- Pickles.

09:22.771 --> 09:24.564
- Bitch, Sandali 22,
sandalwood.

09:24.606 --> 09:27.025
It's becoming
my portable shower.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.321
Thanks for everything, Karaoke.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.245
- Nolan, what's going
on up there?

09:39.287 --> 09:41.539
- I just need a second!

09:41.581 --> 09:43.708
- Nolan! Hey!

10:39.431 --> 10:40.932
- Okay.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.443
One my invite Gehenna
into Earth,

10:51.484 --> 10:54.029
but never Earth into Gehenna.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.405
A door may only be opened

10:55.447 --> 10:58.491
or assigned by
the faithful hand of the Herd.

11:01.703 --> 11:05.373
And just as only the Bloodherd
can open the Door,

11:05.415 --> 11:08.293
only the Bloodherd
can close it.

11:39.115 --> 11:44.162
This fucking sucks!

11:53.296 --> 11:55.256
Ah, ah!

11:57.967 --> 12:00.470
- Why is there a rave
in our house?

12:00.512 --> 12:01.680
- I don't know, Gordon,

12:01.721 --> 12:03.556
what the hell
did you two talk about?

12:03.598 --> 12:05.642
- What?
He wants to be picked on less,

12:05.684 --> 12:07.811
I told him to put on
a suit of armor.

12:07.852 --> 12:11.106
Blend more, be less overt.

12:11.147 --> 12:14.943
- You told our child
to pretend to be someone else?

12:14.984 --> 12:17.529
- Yeah.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.532
- You lost your dadding
privileges for the week.

12:27.455 --> 12:31.001
- Kid?
Talk to us.

12:35.130 --> 12:37.173
Nolan?

12:40.427 --> 12:42.470
Honey?

12:49.602 --> 12:50.937
Mom.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.402
- Nolan?

13:00.030 --> 13:02.240
Help.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.242
- Kid.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.244
Kid, are you all right?

13:54.209 --> 13:56.503
- Snowball?

13:56.544 --> 13:57.796
Not snowball.

14:12.769 --> 14:15.313
- Khalil.

14:21.403 --> 14:24.447
Khalil, you have to stop.

14:25.824 --> 14:27.075
- I don't know
if you practice it

14:27.117 --> 14:30.161
at the Colony, but...

14:30.203 --> 14:32.914
privacy, Carrie.

14:44.300 --> 14:48.054
I'm a clown.

14:48.096 --> 14:51.266
Clown around time.

14:53.351 --> 14:55.437
You ever just let it ride?

14:59.441 --> 15:04.988
Where's Tasha?

15:05.030 --> 15:08.158
- I know you're in there.

15:12.203 --> 15:13.705
- Okay.

15:13.747 --> 15:17.876
- I know you're in there.

15:17.917 --> 15:21.671
Right, Khalil?

15:21.713 --> 15:27.177
- Yes, I'm...
standing right here.

15:31.890 --> 15:37.020
- This mineral,
it's called devil's bone.

15:37.062 --> 15:38.229
It's not gold.

15:44.402 --> 15:46.946
Look.

15:55.330 --> 15:57.916
I'm sorry you were exposed.

16:00.752 --> 16:05.548
- I'm always sticking us
at the edge of things.

16:05.590 --> 16:08.927
It's always humid.

16:08.968 --> 16:13.932
Grasses, lakes...

16:13.973 --> 16:17.477
- Those in charge would never
stoop so low,

16:17.519 --> 16:19.896
do it themselves?

16:19.938 --> 16:21.940
I know.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.025
- We lose our house--
- I know.

16:24.067 --> 16:28.196
- What more can I lose?
- You're whole self.

16:28.238 --> 16:32.242
Please, you have to stop.

16:47.632 --> 16:52.053
Pressure points,
just pressure points.

16:52.095 --> 16:53.013
You're going to be okay.

16:57.308 --> 17:00.854
- Hello?

17:00.895 --> 17:01.646
Nolan?

17:45.523 --> 17:46.483
- Nolan?

19:14.738 --> 19:16.448
- Carrie.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.867
- He's corrupted. He's not
really your dad right now.

19:18.908 --> 19:22.203
- Tasha, baby, your friend
has lost her damn mind.

19:22.245 --> 19:23.830
- I'm so sorry, dad.

19:23.872 --> 19:28.752
Nolan's corrupted too.
He's, um, not himself.

19:28.793 --> 19:30.128
- Are their parents okay?

19:30.170 --> 19:32.547
- They went to the police,
like that'll help.

19:32.589 --> 19:34.591
Holy shit, Carrie.

19:34.632 --> 19:35.842
- If we close that tear,

19:35.884 --> 19:37.344
cut them
off of Gehenna's influence,

19:37.385 --> 19:39.596
they stand a chance at getting
back to normal.

19:39.637 --> 19:40.847
Ready?

19:40.889 --> 19:42.766
- Dude, duh.
Let's go save the town.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.194
- Whoo.

19:54.235 --> 19:57.030
- Whoo!
- Take that, Frisk.

19:57.072 --> 19:58.031
- Frisky!

20:06.748 --> 20:09.292
- Spoons,

20:09.334 --> 20:11.044
I know you're up to some
hectic shit in the afterlife,

20:11.086 --> 20:15.173
so you probably can't hear me.

20:20.470 --> 20:22.305
For you, spoons.

20:24.349 --> 20:28.812
RIPIWP.

20:28.853 --> 20:30.772
Rest in peace in West Pine,
bro.

20:34.109 --> 20:35.360
For life.

20:38.113 --> 20:41.533
Try that shit on me, sicko!

20:41.574 --> 20:43.201
See how you do!

21:03.096 --> 21:05.473
- Ah, ah!

21:12.772 --> 21:18.361
Reece, run!

21:27.537 --> 21:32.083
- Yo, dudes, there's some
drunk fucker out here.

21:32.125 --> 21:36.880
Listen to this.
Ah! Ah!

21:39.507 --> 21:43.261
- Uh?

21:43.303 --> 21:46.973
- Oh, cut off.

21:50.185 --> 21:53.229
In honor
of our fallen brethren,

21:53.271 --> 21:56.149
which of you lads
is man enough to claim

21:56.191 --> 22:00.070
Timothy Spoons-in-ya-beans
Richardson's title

22:00.111 --> 22:05.617
as the one and only...

22:05.658 --> 22:07.494
dumpster bitch?

22:07.535 --> 22:10.121
Huh?

22:10.163 --> 22:11.915
You.

22:11.956 --> 22:14.668
You think you have
what it takes?

22:14.709 --> 22:17.587
- I can only do my best, liege.

22:17.629 --> 22:22.258
- Very well, challenger.

22:22.300 --> 22:24.803
Gentlemen, without further ado,

22:24.844 --> 22:27.639
we bear witness
to our dear friend,

22:27.681 --> 22:30.225
Reece Whelan's courage.

22:30.266 --> 22:33.603
Today, he becomes a man!

22:33.645 --> 22:35.271
Hold your post!

22:35.313 --> 22:38.566
Annihilation!

22:47.158 --> 22:49.786
What the--

23:13.685 --> 23:14.602
- Oh, my God.
