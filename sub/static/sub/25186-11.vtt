<font color="#00FFFF">let that be it and allow me to have</font>

<font color="#FFFF00">I did not get the opportunity</font>

<font color="#FFFF00">and say everything you want to say.</font>

03:55.720 --> 03:58.199
<font color="#FFFF00">With the whole, like,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">re-coupling thing last night,</font>

03:58.200 --> 04:01.159
<font color="#FFFF00">I felt like you put a lot of</font>

04:01.160 --> 04:04.679
<font color="#00FFFF">But the pressure was on.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">You are not letting me speak.</font>

04:04.680 --> 04:06.439
<font color="#FFFF00">You are not letting me speak.</font>

04:06.440 --> 04:09.119
<font color="#FFFF00">We are not having a conversation,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you are getting angry.</font>

04:09.120 --> 04:11.359
<font color="#FFFF00">You are asking me questions.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Let me answer them.</font>

04:11.360 --> 04:13.439
<font color="#FFFF00">Let me give you an answer.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Go ahead. Answer.</font>

04:13.440 --> 04:16.119
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel that, in the last 24 hours,</font>

04:16.120 --> 04:18.519
<font color="#FFFF00">you have put pressure on quite a few</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">situations.</font>

04:18.519 --> 04:20.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I do not feel that you gave me the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">space to talk to her.</font>

04:20.959 --> 04:25.079
<font color="#FFFF00">So, I've gone and had a conversation</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with her. I just asked her what</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">happened last night.</font>

04:25.080 --> 04:28.319
<font color="#FFFF00">Was it to do with the fact that</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I didn't lay it on thick enough?</font>

04:28.320 --> 04:31.079
<font color="#FFFF00">And actually, do you know what?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Part of it is for me to know.</font>

04:31.080 --> 04:35.879
<font color="#FFFF00">In the future, should I be going for</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it more? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Definitely, but come to me</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and tell me</font>

04:35.880 --> 04:37.839
<font color="#00FFFF">that is what you are going to do.</font>

04:37.840 --> 04:41.839
<font color="#FFFF00">I did not mean to upset you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in any way. I apologise for that.</font>

04:41.840 --> 04:43.919
<font color="#00FFFF">You haven't upset me,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">it has (BLEEP) me off.</font>

04:43.920 --> 04:46.159
<font color="#00FFFF">I feel that you owe it to me to say,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">"Oh,</font>

04:46.160 --> 04:49.039
<font color="#00FFFF">you know the girl you just got with?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">That you have grafted with?</font>

04:49.040 --> 04:50.919
<font color="#00FFFF">Actually, I would love to go and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">find out</font>

04:50.920 --> 04:52.479
<font color="#00FFFF">why she is not interested in me."</font>

04:52.480 --> 04:56.439
<font color="#FFFF00">What is wrong with that?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">What is wrong with me asking her...</font>

04:56.440 --> 04:59.599
<font color="#00FFFF">Because you are asking her</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">in order to get in there.</font>

04:59.600 --> 05:02.479
<font color="#FFFF00">I think he's being quite</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">unreasonable and unfair.</font>

05:02.480 --> 05:05.079
<font color="#FFFF00">If you look at what happened</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in the last 24 hours,</font>

05:05.080 --> 05:07.039
<font color="#FFFF00">I think quite a lot of people would</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">agree</font>

05:07.040 --> 05:09.599
<font color="#FFFF00">that he showed me more disrespect</font>

05:09.600 --> 05:13.519
<font color="#FFFF00">and was more unfair in the way</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">he treated me than what I have done.</font>

05:13.520 --> 05:16.639
<font color="#FFFF00">I do not think I was dishonest</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in what I did.</font>

05:16.640 --> 05:19.239
<font color="#FFFF00">Have I stopped you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">getting to know her?</font>

05:19.240 --> 05:22.319
<font color="#00FFFF">No, but you are trying to.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">You are trying. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> No, I'm not.</font>

05:22.320 --> 05:25.719
<font color="#FFFF00">OK, how have I tried to stop you?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">How have I stopped you?</font>

05:25.720 --> 05:29.519
<font color="#00FFFF">You are going to try to,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">which is why I am sat here.</font>

05:29.520 --> 05:32.479
<font color="#FFFF00">You want to try and scare me off.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm not trying to scare you off.</font>

05:32.480 --> 05:35.599
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm not here to scare anyone. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> You</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">are saying I'm disrespecting</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you.</font>

05:35.600 --> 05:38.039
<font color="#00FFFF">I am here to get what I want,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and that is what I want.</font>

05:38.040 --> 05:40.479
<font color="#00FFFF">And that is what I want to say,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you at least owe it to me,</font>

05:40.480 --> 05:42.839
<font color="#00FFFF">because we have always had</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">an open relationship.</font>

05:42.840 --> 05:44.519
<font color="#00FFFF">At least you owe me the respect,</font>

05:44.520 --> 05:47.119
<font color="#00FFFF">because I have always been honest</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and open with you.</font>

05:47.120 --> 05:50.399
<font color="#00FFFF">We have always spoken about us being</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">honest and open with each other,</font>

05:50.400 --> 05:53.599
<font color="#00FFFF">and I think he owed it to me because</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I have been there for him</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">throughout.</font>

05:53.600 --> 05:56.399
<font color="#00FFFF">I have my own morals and values that</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I stick by,</font>

05:56.400 --> 06:00.279
<font color="#00FFFF">and maybe I expect too much</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">from people.</font>

06:00.280 --> 06:03.199
<font color="#FFFF00">I am sorry that you feel angry</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">at me.</font>

06:03.200 --> 06:06.040
<font color="#00FFFF">I just think you should have</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">come to me first.</font>

06:27.200 --> 06:30.560
<font color="#00FFFF">Positive good vibes.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Only good vibes in here.</font>

06:34.640 --> 06:38.200
Come and join us in this
ritual ceremony of feelings.

06:39.320 --> 06:43.799
<font color="#FFFF00">He feels that I have disrespected</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">him by being dishonest.</font>

06:43.800 --> 06:47.159
<font color="#00FFFF">What, are they married now?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, that is what...</font>

06:47.160 --> 06:50.159
<font color="#FFFF00">I said to him that I don't feel</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that I've been dishonest</font>

06:50.160 --> 06:51.519
<font color="#FFFF00">in what I've done.</font>

06:51.520 --> 06:55.239
<font color="#FFFF00">If you remember from the start,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">he said that we are all in couples,</font>

06:55.240 --> 06:59.319
<font color="#FFFF00">but does that mean that we can't get</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to know each other? That is what he</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">said from the start.</font>

06:59.320 --> 07:01.679
<font color="#11FF11">It worked when he was with Hayley.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, with Hayley</font>

07:01.680 --> 07:05.599
<font color="#FFFF00">and he wanted to get to know the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">other girls. But now I might want</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to get to know someone</font>

07:05.600 --> 07:08.839
<font color="#FFFF00">that I was openly trying to get to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">know beforehand, he doesn't like it.</font>

07:08.840 --> 07:12.639
<font color="#11FF11">I'm proud of Alex, like,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">he's ate the opportunity up tonight.</font>

07:12.640 --> 07:16.159
<font color="#11FF11">He got a fresh haircut,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">he is changing his outfits up,</font>

07:16.160 --> 07:19.479
<font color="#11FF11">he's taking life by the balls.</font>

07:19.480 --> 07:23.039
Ironically, since Adam started
dressing like a James Bond villain,

07:23.040 --> 07:26.759
he's behaving like a proper gent,
and Rosie's liking it.

07:26.760 --> 07:29.519
I'm feeling happy today.
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes, we've had a good night.</font>

07:29.520 --> 07:32.199
How long can you pull off
this good boy act?

07:32.200 --> 07:34.480
<font color="#FFFF00">Stay in the good books.</font>

07:39.520 --> 07:43.079
Adam and I are really good today.
We had a really fun day

07:43.080 --> 07:46.119
and he has said that he is really
glad that we have coupled up again

07:46.120 --> 07:49.319
and that we're happy, so, yeah,
baby steps, but it is going well.

07:49.320 --> 07:53.279
<font color="#FFFF00">Me and Charlie, right, you cannot</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">tell anyone this.</font>

07:53.280 --> 07:56.279
<font color="#FFFF00">Swear. Just me, you and Charlie.</font>
Swear.

07:56.280 --> 08:00.279
<font color="#FFFF00">So, basically,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">me and Charlie realised</font>

08:00.280 --> 08:03.399
<font color="#FFFF00">that every time Alex was going to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">speak to Megan</font>

08:03.400 --> 08:05.679
<font color="#FFFF00">that Eyal was just getting</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in the way.</font>

08:05.680 --> 08:08.319
<font color="#FFFF00">So we made this little mission of,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">like,</font>

08:08.320 --> 08:10.999
<font color="#FFFF00">getting Alex in to speak to Megan.</font>

08:11.000 --> 08:13.639
<font color="#FFFF00">By the way, you cannot tell anyone,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">not even Megan.</font>

08:13.640 --> 08:17.839
<font color="#FFFF00">If Eyal does ever find out that we</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">were distracting him,</font>

08:17.840 --> 08:21.639
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't know if he will actually</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">see the funny side.</font>

08:21.640 --> 08:25.439
<font color="#FFFF00">If he is happy with Megan,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Megan will choose him regardless.</font>

08:25.440 --> 08:28.120
<font color="#FFFF00">We were just opening up a door</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">for Alex.</font>

to Charlie

08:39.080 --> 08:40.839

08:40.840 --> 08:43.039

<font color="#FFFF00">you know.</font>

08:55.040 --> 08:57.839

<font color="#00FFFF">mate, the exact same thing.</font>

08:57.840 --> 09:01.879
<font color="#00FFFF">He got fed up with it. He was doing</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the same thing and she was just</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">giving him a cold shoulder.</font>

09:01.880 --> 09:05.719
<font color="#FFFF00">I just think she could show a bit</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">more affection, rather than it all</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">coming from me.</font>

09:05.720 --> 09:07.839
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel like she could give me</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a bit more.</font>

09:07.840 --> 09:10.679
Are you all right? <font color="#FFFF00">I just don't know</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">where my head is at again.</font>

09:10.680 --> 09:13.439
<font color="#FFFF00">It's annoying me because I feel like</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm being dead fussy,</font>

09:13.440 --> 09:16.799
<font color="#FFFF00">but neither do I just want</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to rush something with someone.</font>

09:16.800 --> 09:21.079
He wants to get to know you,
he fancies you, like,
he really fancies you.

09:21.080 --> 09:25.679
He probably thinks,
'Why isn't she like this with me?'

09:25.680 --> 09:28.399
<font color="#FFFF00">But I haven't got that physical</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">attraction.</font>

09:28.400 --> 09:31.039
<font color="#FFFF00">At the end of the day, if I've got</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">some elements of doubt,</font>

09:31.040 --> 09:34.359
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm not going to force myself and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">put everything into that one person.</font>

09:34.360 --> 09:37.559
<font color="#FFFF00">I do enjoy being around him as a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">person, which is a start,</font>

09:37.560 --> 09:41.439
<font color="#FFFF00">and I do kiss him, but that is just</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">like a harmless kiss and cuddle.</font>

09:41.440 --> 09:43.239
<font color="#FFFF00">There is nothing to it.</font>

09:43.240 --> 09:46.679
<font color="#FFFF00">But that just sometimes gives me a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">bit of comfort in my relationship,</font>

09:46.680 --> 09:49.839
<font color="#FFFF00">because I feel like in here you need</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a sense of reassurance,</font>

09:49.840 --> 09:53.319
<font color="#FFFF00">otherwise you can feel lonely</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">if you have got no-one.</font>

09:53.320 --> 09:56.959
She is so, like...
She's a proper sort.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.599
Top shelf.

09:58.600 --> 10:02.959
<font color="#00FFFF">You are stuck between a rock and a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">hard place, really, because you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">don't want to not put it on her,</font>

10:02.960 --> 10:07.879
<font color="#00FFFF">because then she'll think you're not</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">interested, but then you don't want</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to put it on her and get rejected.</font>

10:07.880 --> 10:09.559
No-one likes to be rejected.

10:09.560 --> 10:12.000
<font color="#00FFFF">But she isn't going to reject you.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">No way.</font>

10:13.040 --> 10:16.079
<font color="#00FFFF">Am I being loud?</font>
No. No.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.639
I just feel like she was
talking about me.

10:18.640 --> 10:20.279
I don't know.

10:20.280 --> 10:25.119
<font color="#FFFF00">What I think is, oh, he's a really</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">nice person. He's really caring.</font>

10:25.120 --> 10:29.479
<font color="#FFFF00">But, like, I couldn't imagine myself</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">having sex with him.</font>

10:29.480 --> 10:31.719
Oh, do you not imagine that at all?
<font color="#FFFF00">No. No.</font>

10:31.720 --> 10:33.999
<font color="#00FFFF">Like, when you date someone</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and you think, OK,</font>

10:34.000 --> 10:36.799
<font color="#00FFFF">maybe they are not husband material,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">or whatever,</font>

10:36.800 --> 10:39.799
<font color="#00FFFF">but you kind of just have a couple</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">of dates because...</font>

10:39.800 --> 10:42.759
<font color="#00FFFF">We all need to be selfish sometimes,</font>

10:42.760 --> 10:45.039
<font color="#00FFFF">and it's not like you are</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">using anyone.</font>

10:45.040 --> 10:48.359
<font color="#FFFF00">I think Charlie</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is a very lovely person.</font>

10:48.360 --> 10:53.479
<font color="#FFFF00">He seems very genuine and he is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">very caring, and he makes effort.</font>

10:53.480 --> 10:59.039
<font color="#FFFF00">But I just don't want to rush into</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">anything,</font>

10:59.040 --> 11:02.839
<font color="#FFFF00">because I don't feel the need,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to be honest.</font>

11:02.840 --> 11:04.079
'No rush, Hayley,

11:04.080 --> 11:07.639
but if you could make your mind up
before the live final. Cheers, hun!

11:07.640 --> 11:11.799
Now Charlie's spoken to Jack, Dani
wants her man to spill the goss.'

11:11.800 --> 11:15.199
<font color="#FFFF00">What has Charlie been saying to you?</font>
He just speaks to me.

11:15.200 --> 11:18.559
<font color="#FFFF00">Is he all right?</font> He just speaks to
me, I just think he feels a bit bad.

11:18.560 --> 11:21.279
What is she waiting for? <font color="#FFFF00">That's what</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I said. And she's, like,</font>

11:21.280 --> 11:22.679
<font color="#FFFF00">"He's not my type."</font>

11:22.680 --> 11:25.959
<font color="#FFFF00">How do you know he's not your type?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">"You are not letting your guard</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">down."</font>

11:25.960 --> 11:27.839
<font color="#FFFF00">She's, like,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">"I have let my guard down."</font>

11:27.840 --> 11:31.199
<font color="#FFFF00">You need to look at someone</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and think, you know what? I've</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">coupled with you,</font>

11:31.200 --> 11:34.759
<font color="#FFFF00">and you might just know what their</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">brother or sister is called...</font>
Does she know?

11:34.760 --> 11:38.639
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't know, probably fucking not.</font>
(LAUGHTER) She properly knows
nothing, does she?!

11:38.640 --> 11:42.279
She doesn't ask anyone anything.
That is what Eyal said.

11:42.280 --> 11:47.279
(AS EYAL) I could have told you this.
I could have told you. <font color="#FFFF00">(AS EYAL) You</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">know, the vibes, you know...</font>

11:47.280 --> 11:50.039
(AS EYAL) She's not very nice.
(LAUGHS)

11:50.040 --> 11:53.039
That's what he said about her!
<font color="#FFFF00">Don't, that's not fair.</font>

11:53.040 --> 11:55.759
I think she's nice.
She cracks me up, mate.

11:55.760 --> 11:57.599
<font color="#FFFF00">I love Hayley,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I absolutely adore her.</font>

11:57.600 --> 12:00.839
But at the same time, you've got to
give him half a chance, haven't you?

12:00.840 --> 12:04.159
<font color="#FFFF00">Look at me and you.</font> Yeah. I didn't
think this would happen, mate.

12:04.160 --> 12:06.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I haven't even properly kissed you.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Do you find it weird?</font>

12:06.960 --> 12:09.079
Give me a kiss, then.
<font color="#FFFF00">What, a proper one?</font>

12:09.080 --> 12:13.919
Yes. <font color="#FFFF00">But I get scared.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">What's wrong with me?</font>

12:13.920 --> 12:17.959
What are you getting embarrassed for?
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm just embarrassed.</font>
Just give me a kiss.

12:17.960 --> 12:21.399
(LAUGHS) Give me a kiss. Give me
a kiss. Stop getting embarrassed.

12:21.400 --> 12:26.080
Give me a kiss.
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel like a little child!</font>

12:38.920 --> 12:41.599
<font color="#FFFF00">Don't tell the boys you've had</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a ten-second kiss.</font> I won't.

12:41.600 --> 12:44.119
I beat my record with Dani
kisses tonight.

12:44.120 --> 12:48.639
It was a proper kiss.
She went in for me, as well.

12:48.640 --> 12:50.799
I was over the moon.
I couldn't believe it.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.160
I thought Christmas had come early.
(LAUGHS)

13:01.000 --> 13:03.199
'It's time to hit the hay.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.839
And the thing about communal
bedrooms

13:05.840 --> 13:09.479
is you get a lot of different moods
under the same roof.

13:09.480 --> 13:11.560
There's reflective,

13:12.840 --> 13:15.639
raunchy,

13:15.640 --> 13:19.960
regretful, and ridiculously happy.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.199
That's Love Island for you.

13:24.200 --> 13:28.520
Life's rich tapestry played out on
a load of flat pack beds from Ikea.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.959
Still to come...

13:50.960 --> 13:52.959
Eyal wants answers.'

13:52.960 --> 13:55.920
<font color="#FFFF00">You guys tried to mug me off</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">last night.</font>

14:03.520 --> 14:08.560
# Try me in the morning
when the sun comes rising up #

14:10.280 --> 14:16.199
Last night, Alex was making some
very loud noises under the duvet.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.080
It actually woke people up.

14:23.240 --> 14:26.919
<font color="#FFFF00">I think it was Alex.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Was it me? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Yeah mate, it was you.</font>

14:26.920 --> 14:29.119
<font color="#FFFF00">It's that new haircut.</font>

14:29.120 --> 14:32.640
'He was snoring. What were you lot
thinking, you filthy pigs?'

14:49.880 --> 14:52.120
<font color="#FFFF00">Because it's been a week. (LAUGHTER)</font>

15:03.480 --> 15:05.359
<font color="#FFFF00">Obviously, it's very nice to hear.</font>

15:05.360 --> 15:09.759
<font color="#FFFF00">But, I'm just very aware of people</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">saying things that they don't mean</font>

15:09.760 --> 15:13.079
<font color="#FFFF00">or it's very early to be saying</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">things like that.</font>

15:13.080 --> 15:15.999
<font color="#FFFF00">I know he didn't say love.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">For me, it's similar.</font>

15:16.000 --> 15:17.999
<font color="#FFFF00">Maybe a miscommunication,</font>

15:18.000 --> 15:20.239
<font color="#FFFF00">But I really just want to be on the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">same page.</font>

15:20.240 --> 15:22.199
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't want him to be like,</font>

15:22.200 --> 15:24.279
<font color="#FFFF00">"Oh my God, I have fallen</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in love with Laura",</font>

15:24.280 --> 15:26.759
<font color="#FFFF00">and then I'm just like, "Oh..."</font>

15:26.760 --> 15:30.639
'Laura has carried the bed all the
way outside without spilling Wes.

15:30.640 --> 15:33.359
Impressive -
and now it's time to talk.'

15:33.360 --> 15:36.719
<font color="#FFFF00">What you said to me last night,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">what does that mean to you?</font>

15:36.720 --> 15:39.519
<font color="#00FFFF">I just started</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to have feelings for you.</font>

15:39.520 --> 15:41.599
<font color="#FFFF00">You said, "I've fallen for you".</font>

15:41.600 --> 15:44.599
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, not like</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I have fallen in love.</font>

15:44.600 --> 15:47.719
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah but that's what I took it as.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">That's why I reacted.</font>

15:47.720 --> 15:50.119
<font color="#00FFFF">No, no. It's been a week, Laura.</font>

15:50.120 --> 15:53.599
<font color="#FFFF00">I know, but when someone says that</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to me, that's what I hear, right?</font>

15:53.600 --> 15:57.279
<font color="#00FFFF">Not falling in love. I'm not saying</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that, I'm just saying.</font>

15:57.280 --> 16:00.599
<font color="#FFFF00">But isn't that what it means?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">It's fallen.</font>

16:00.600 --> 16:03.359
<font color="#FFFF00">Fallen is like you are close to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">falling in love with someone.</font>

16:03.360 --> 16:06.239
<font color="#00FFFF">You have not fell, have you?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">No, not at all.</font>

16:06.240 --> 16:10.879
<font color="#FFFF00">Let's not argue. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I'm not arguing.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't love you, OK?</font>

16:10.880 --> 16:16.079
<font color="#00FFFF">That's not what I'm saying. What I'm</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">saying is I can see the start of it.</font>

16:16.080 --> 16:19.199
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm not saying I fucking love you.</font>

16:19.200 --> 16:24.439
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm not gonna be angry at you,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">if you did say that.</font>

16:24.440 --> 16:27.279
<font color="#FFFF00">I was just shocked, that's all.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">No, just saying...</font>

16:27.280 --> 16:29.719
<font color="#FFFF00">It doesn't mean that I don't,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">like, care about you</font>

16:29.720 --> 16:31.239
<font color="#FFFF00">and think things are going well.</font>

16:31.240 --> 16:34.239
<font color="#FFFF00">I just never want to want you to say</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">something that you don't mean.</font>

16:34.240 --> 16:36.839
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't think these</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">words should be thrown around.</font>

16:36.840 --> 16:41.239
<font color="#00FFFF">It's weird. You don't realise</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">until you are in here how fast</font>

16:41.240 --> 16:48.599
<font color="#00FFFF">you form relationships and feelings.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">It shocked me, and it's quite scary.</font>

16:48.600 --> 16:51.519
<font color="#00FFFF">I haven't had eyes for anyone in the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">villa.</font>

16:51.520 --> 16:53.719
<font color="#00FFFF">Yes, it's a bit silly, I suppose,</font>

16:53.720 --> 16:56.079
<font color="#00FFFF">because you want to keep your</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">options open in here,</font>

16:56.080 --> 16:58.399
<font color="#00FFFF">but I have tunnel vision on Laura</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">at the moment.</font>

16:58.400 --> 17:01.839
<font color="#00FFFF">And I think that, yes, it leaves me</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">vulnerable, but I don't really care.</font>

17:01.840 --> 17:04.839
<font color="#00FFFF">So, it is what it is.</font>

17:08.920 --> 17:13.799
There is only two people who want to
see Eyal with Megan. Eyal and me.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.799
Because "M-eyeal"
is really fun to say.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.439
And now Rosie is trying to stir
things up.

17:19.440 --> 17:23.999
<font color="#FFFF00">Obviously, Alex told you that</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">he couldn't speak to you,</font>

17:24.000 --> 17:26.679
<font color="#FFFF00">because Eyal kept coming in between.</font>

17:26.680 --> 17:30.559
<font color="#FFFF00">And, like you said, you realised</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that's probably true, isn't it?</font>

17:30.560 --> 17:36.359
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, it is. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> So, Adam and Charlie</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">came up with a bit of plan.</font>

17:36.360 --> 17:41.799
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, no way. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> You know when Eyal got</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">called over there to talk to them?</font>

17:41.800 --> 17:47.039
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Well, they were like</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">distracting him. It was hilarious.</font>

17:47.040 --> 17:49.159
<font color="#FFFF00">I love them, they are so cute.</font>

17:49.160 --> 17:53.839
<font color="#FFFF00">Adam said he was literally thinking</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">about anything to talk about.</font>

17:53.840 --> 17:59.079
<font color="#00FFFF">It is hilarious. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> How funny.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I mean, it's no big deal.</font>

17:59.080 --> 18:03.399
<font color="#FFFF00">I think they're just worried,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">because he was going to be angry</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with them.</font>

18:03.400 --> 18:06.959
<font color="#FFFF00">But it's no big deal.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">It's just talking to you.</font>

18:06.960 --> 18:12.479
<font color="#11FF11">After last night, I thought that she</font>
<font color="#11FF11">would be more chatty.</font>

18:12.480 --> 18:14.399
<font color="#11FF11">But I can't really tell.</font>

18:14.400 --> 18:17.239
<font color="#11FF11">Like, they are kissing and there is</font>
<font color="#11FF11">a lot of affection going on.</font>

18:17.240 --> 18:20.199
<font color="#11FF11">There is a lot of cuddling and</font>
<font color="#11FF11">stuff. They seem really couple-y,</font>

18:20.200 --> 18:22.839
<font color="#11FF11">so I can't really say</font>
<font color="#11FF11">what's going on, to be honest.</font>

18:22.840 --> 18:25.479
<font color="#11FF11">My head, in all honesty,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">it's bit confused at the moment.</font>

18:25.480 --> 18:29.439
<font color="#11FF11">I really like Eyal, and I don't want</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to upset people that way,</font>

18:29.440 --> 18:31.879
<font color="#11FF11">but at the same time, who knows?</font>

18:31.880 --> 18:35.559
<font color="#11FF11">Maybe me and Megan have more</font>
<font color="#11FF11">of a connection, you don't know.</font>

18:35.560 --> 18:37.479
<font color="#11FF11">I feel like I haven't done</font>
<font color="#11FF11">anything wrong</font>

18:37.480 --> 18:40.319
<font color="#11FF11">and I don't think I'm doing</font>
<font color="#11FF11">anything wrong getting to know her.</font>

18:40.320 --> 18:42.439
<font color="#11FF11">Re-coupling doesn't mean that's</font>
<font color="#11FF11">your girl.</font>

18:42.440 --> 18:44.439
<font color="#11FF11">She's not possession, so, yeah.</font>

18:44.440 --> 18:47.439
<font color="#11FF11">I'd love to know what her thoughts</font>
<font color="#11FF11">are after last night.</font>

18:47.440 --> 18:50.639
<font color="#11FF11">And after he came over</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and he was quite angry and stuff,</font>

18:50.640 --> 18:52.039
<font color="#11FF11">what does she think of that?</font>

18:52.040 --> 18:54.719
<font color="#FFFF00">Do you think I was a bit too harsh</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">on Alex last night?</font>

18:54.720 --> 18:58.999
No, I don't think so.
You wasn't aggressive, was you?

18:59.000 --> 19:00.639
<font color="#FFFF00">No, not at all.</font>

19:00.640 --> 19:04.519
<font color="#FFFF00">I am not here to just make friends</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and be mates with all the boys.</font>

19:04.520 --> 19:08.479
<font color="#FFFF00">It is great if we all are mates,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">but at the same time,</font>

19:08.480 --> 19:11.399
<font color="#FFFF00">I want to be coupled up with you</font>

19:11.400 --> 19:14.799
<font color="#FFFF00">and I don't really want him to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">fuck it up.</font>

19:14.800 --> 19:17.039
Yeah. All the other boys,

19:17.040 --> 19:20.239
they kind of had a little mission to
get you distracted

19:20.240 --> 19:23.479
then he will come over to me.
<font color="#FFFF00">Really?</font> Did they tell you?

19:23.480 --> 19:28.879
<font color="#FFFF00">No.</font> Who was it?
Adam and Charlie called you over.

19:28.880 --> 19:30.879
What was they saying to you?

19:30.880 --> 19:33.799
<font color="#FFFF00">We were just talking about, like,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">being spiritual.</font>

19:33.800 --> 19:36.759
<font color="#FFFF00">They were just throwing</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">fucking banter at me and shit.</font>

19:36.760 --> 19:40.959
Yeah, that was when.
It was like, "God."

19:40.960 --> 19:45.239
<font color="#FFFF00">You lie! You lie.</font> I don't think
it was, like, malicious.

19:45.240 --> 19:50.639
It was funny. <font color="#FFFF00">I just think he could</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">have fucking come and told me.</font>

19:50.640 --> 19:52.999
<font color="#FFFF00">It wasn't like I was going to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">stop him doing it.</font>

19:53.000 --> 19:58.320
<font color="#FFFF00">It wasn't easy for me to kind of put</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it on you and find that confidence.</font>

20:00.480 --> 20:02.879
I don't take it lightly, personally.

20:02.880 --> 20:06.199
<font color="#FFFF00">That's fucked me off a little bit,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that plan.</font>

20:06.200 --> 20:09.439
No. They were just trying to help.
<font color="#FFFF00">They didn't say anything.</font>

20:09.440 --> 20:12.920
Don't say I told you.
<font color="#FFFF00">I won't, I won't. I promise.</font>

20:15.280 --> 20:18.559
<font color="#FFFF00">(SIGHS) I am slightly pissed off,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I won't lie.</font>

20:18.560 --> 20:20.799
<font color="#FFFF00">I didn't expect it from the boys.</font>

20:20.800 --> 20:23.399
<font color="#FFFF00">I want to say something,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">but at the same time,</font>

20:23.400 --> 20:29.239
<font color="#FFFF00">Megan has told me in confidence</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and I don't want to rat her out.</font>

20:29.240 --> 20:37.240
<font color="#FFFF00">I think that will just screw things</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with me and her. I don't know.</font>

20:38.320 --> 20:41.880
<font color="#FFFF00">Boys. Will you all just</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">come and sit here for a sec?</font>

20:52.840 --> 20:55.279
<font color="#FFFF00">I may as well do it</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in the exact same spot.</font>

20:55.280 --> 21:00.039
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel you guys tried to just</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">fucking mug me off last night...</font>

21:00.040 --> 21:03.319
<font color="#FFFF00">Cos you came up with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">this little plan.</font>

21:03.320 --> 21:06.999
<font color="#FFFF00">You obviously called me over,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and to be honest, like,</font>

21:07.000 --> 21:09.559
<font color="#FFFF00">one, you were mugging me off</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">about what I believe in,</font>

21:09.560 --> 21:11.679
<font color="#FFFF00">you also you had a plan</font>

21:11.680 --> 21:13.759
<font color="#FFFF00">so that Alex could go</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and take Megan off.</font>

21:13.760 --> 21:16.639
<font color="#FFFF00">All I have ever been is loyal</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to each one of you.</font>

21:16.640 --> 21:20.639
<font color="#FFFF00">You two obviously came up with a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">plan and I don't really understand.</font>

21:20.640 --> 21:24.199
<font color="#00FFFF">Me and Charlie were just having a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">little bit of light-hearted banter</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with you.</font>

21:24.200 --> 21:25.959
<font color="#00FFFF">We weren't taking the piss</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">out of you.</font>

21:25.960 --> 21:30.319
<font color="#FFFF00">No, but you called me over so Alex</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">could get his chance.</font>

21:30.320 --> 21:32.199
<font color="#FFFF00">When would I ever stand</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in his way?</font>

21:32.200 --> 21:34.759
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't think Alex felt</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">comfortable enough at the time.</font>

21:34.760 --> 21:38.079
<font color="#00FFFF">If we are being honest, he didn't</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">feel that he could go and speak</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to Megan.</font>

21:38.080 --> 21:40.159
<font color="#FFFF00">But then one of you two</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">should have said to me,</font>

21:40.160 --> 21:42.799
<font color="#FFFF00">Alex wants to speak to Megan.</font>
You would be fuming about it.

21:42.800 --> 21:45.479
<font color="#FFFF00">I wouldn't have got fuming</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">about it.</font> I think you would have.

21:45.480 --> 21:47.999
<font color="#FFFF00">No, I am fuming because you guys</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">fucking... I thought...</font>

21:48.000 --> 21:50.999
You should have had it with Alex last
night. <font color="#FFFF00">I am not an angry person.</font>

21:51.000 --> 21:54.639
Why should Alex come to you to speak
to Megan? Surely he can just go
straight to her.

21:54.640 --> 21:57.999
<font color="#FFFF00">You could have just said to me,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel like you haven't given me</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the chance.</font>

21:58.000 --> 22:00.599
What about when you, like,
necked Megan in front of Alex?

22:00.600 --> 22:03.159
<font color="#FFFF00">I have expressed that I did not</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">do that in a malicious way.</font>

22:03.160 --> 22:07.079
It is the same thing, mate. It's not,
like, let's mug you off here.

22:07.080 --> 22:10.199
I can see why you feel like that,

22:10.200 --> 22:12.479
the last thing I want to do
is single you out.

22:12.480 --> 22:15.079
<font color="#FFFF00">But that is how it is going to feel.</font>

22:15.080 --> 22:17.559
<font color="#00FFFF">Eyal is soft-spoken,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">he has got lovely energy,</font>

22:17.560 --> 22:20.039
<font color="#00FFFF">but if he wants to say something,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">mate, he will say it.</font>

22:20.040 --> 22:24.239
<font color="#00FFFF">Trust me, he don't give a shit. He</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">will pull anyone and tell them,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">do you know what I mean?</font>

22:24.240 --> 22:26.360
<font color="#00FFFF">Who knows about what has</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">just happened?</font>

22:27.880 --> 22:31.880
<font color="#00FFFF">Right, who told Eyal?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Did you tell him?</font>

22:33.080 --> 22:34.719
<font color="#00FFFF">Megan, man!</font>

22:34.720 --> 22:36.199
What? It is harsh.

22:36.200 --> 22:40.159
I am, like, coupled up with him and I
don't tell him. <font color="#00FFFF">I know, but he feels</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">really mugged off.</font>

22:40.160 --> 22:42.519
<font color="#00FFFF">You know what Eyal is like.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">He takes things to heart.</font>

22:42.520 --> 22:45.479
I know, but when I told him,
I was like, it is funny. He laughed.

22:45.480 --> 22:47.599
<font color="#11FF11">We were laughing about it,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">weren't we?</font>

22:47.600 --> 22:49.999
<font color="#FFFF00">If you would have called me over</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and just said to me,</font>

22:50.000 --> 22:53.039
<font color="#FFFF00">"We have done this because we want</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to give Alex a chance with Megan</font>

22:53.040 --> 22:56.239
<font color="#FFFF00">and we feel like you should</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">just stay here". And then we start</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">chatting.</font>

22:56.240 --> 22:59.359
You would have been cool with that?
<font color="#11FF11">I don't think you would have been.</font>

22:59.360 --> 23:02.159
<font color="#FFFF00">I would have been cool with it.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">You are quite angry with us now.</font>

23:02.160 --> 23:04.119
That is what we are saying, bro.
It's hard.

23:04.120 --> 23:08.679
<font color="#11FF11">You were very angry when I said...</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you were swearing and shouting.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I wasn't shouting. I was swearing.</font>

23:08.680 --> 23:11.039
<font color="#11FF11">I felt like you were quite</font>
<font color="#11FF11">aggressive at one point.</font>

23:11.040 --> 23:13.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't think I was aggressive.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I think you were quite angry.</font>

23:13.960 --> 23:18.039
<font color="#00FFFF">Megan, are you split between them</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">at all? Like, at all?</font>

23:18.040 --> 23:21.639
Yeah, I was,
but anything can happen.

23:21.640 --> 23:26.159
Like, a new girl or boy
could walk through the door
and we could change our minds.

23:26.160 --> 23:29.719
<font color="#11FF11">The last thing I want to do is be</font>
<font color="#11FF11">sneaky towards a mate of mine.</font>

23:29.720 --> 23:32.799
<font color="#FFFF00">But that is how it feels.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I get your point</font>

23:32.800 --> 23:34.759
<font color="#11FF11">and I think you have</font>
<font color="#11FF11">put it across well.</font>

23:34.760 --> 23:36.639
<font color="#11FF11">If it was one of us,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I would feel the same.</font>

23:36.640 --> 23:39.519
<font color="#11FF11">But I also feel like Alex</font>
<font color="#11FF11">was pushed into a bit of a corner</font>

23:39.520 --> 23:42.159
<font color="#11FF11">and the way you spoke to him</font>
<font color="#11FF11">last night was a bit off.</font>

23:42.160 --> 23:45.479
<font color="#11FF11">There was a few things. I understand</font>
<font color="#11FF11">your point on pulling us for a chat.</font>

23:45.480 --> 23:48.159
<font color="#11FF11">Sorry that you feel like that.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Cheers.</font>

23:48.160 --> 23:49.959
<font color="#11FF11">Don't want you to feel like that,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">bro.</font>

23:49.960 --> 23:52.439
<font color="#11FF11">I don't like it that you feel</font>
<font color="#11FF11">like we snaked you out.</font>

23:52.440 --> 23:54.920
Come here. We're mates.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.040
<font color="#FFFF00">No more.</font>

24:02.520 --> 24:05.759
Coffee? <font color="#00FFFF">I did not think it would</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">get that out of hand.</font>

24:05.760 --> 24:07.879
<font color="#FFFF00">Obviously, I am quite fucked off.</font>

24:07.880 --> 24:10.039
<font color="#FFFF00">It has been left</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">how it has been left,</font>

24:10.040 --> 24:13.719
<font color="#FFFF00">that I know the few people</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that I can trust in here.</font>

24:13.720 --> 24:17.079
<font color="#FFFF00">I have learned a valuable lesson</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">which I've always known.</font>

24:17.080 --> 24:20.879
<font color="#FFFF00">Evidently, when I forget it,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I am reminded of it,</font>

24:20.880 --> 24:23.200
<font color="#FFFF00">which is that people snake you.</font>

24:26.480 --> 24:29.159
What is that grin for?
<font color="#00FFFF">I didn't know, Eyal.</font>

24:29.160 --> 24:30.639
<font color="#FFFF00">I know you didn't.</font>

24:30.640 --> 24:34.639
<font color="#FFFF00">I am not gonna be mugged off by</font>

All right, we showed it to Andy the
intern.

<font color="#FFFF00">of course, we do feel vulnerable.</font>

38:12.960 --> 38:14.280
<font color="#FFFF00">I think.</font>

38:15.600 --> 38:18.319
<font color="#00FFFF">On a personal level, do you think</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">we are compatible?</font>

38:18.320 --> 38:20.199
<font color="#00FFFF">From my point of view, I just feel</font>

38:20.200 --> 38:22.759
<font color="#00FFFF">like we had a connection and I never</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">rushed it at all.</font>

38:36.280 --> 38:38.399
<font color="#00FFFF">Since when?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I have.</font>

38:38.400 --> 38:41.599
<font color="#11FF11">You know what, I could have picked</font>
<font color="#11FF11">anyone. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> So could I.</font>

38:41.600 --> 38:45.759
<font color="#11FF11">It wasn't up to you, was it? Was it</font>
<font color="#11FF11">up to you? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> No. </font><font color="#11FF11"> There you go.</font>

<font color="#11FF11">Charlie, you're annoying me.</font>

38:49.320 --> 38:51.359
<font color="#00FFFF">Why is that? Because you are wrong?</font>

38:51.360 --> 38:54.199
<font color="#FFFF00">The only fair way to do this is to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">answer</font>

38:54.200 --> 38:57.719
<font color="#FFFF00">the question, which is based</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">on pure compatibility.</font>

38:57.720 --> 38:59.719
<font color="#FFFF00">Not who you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">get on the most with.</font>

38:59.720 --> 39:02.079
<font color="#11FF11">It is the biggest twist so far.</font>

39:02.080 --> 39:06.679
<font color="#11FF11">We have control over, possibly,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">ending someone's journey here.</font>

39:06.680 --> 39:08.680
<font color="#11FF11">It makes you feel sick.</font>

39:17.480 --> 39:19.279
<font color="#00FFFF">Do you?</font>

39:19.280 --> 39:21.920
<font color="#00FFFF">You have got to think, on the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">outside...</font>

39:24.640 --> 39:26.120
<font color="#FFFF00">I think so.</font>

39:28.360 --> 39:30.239
<font color="#11FF11">Josh and Georgia?</font>

39:30.240 --> 39:34.919
<font color="#11FF11">Today they did really well in the</font>
<font color="#11FF11">compatibility challenge.</font>

39:34.920 --> 39:39.799
<font color="#11FF11">That has pushed me thinking they</font>
<font color="#11FF11">genuinely like each other.</font>

39:39.800 --> 39:42.959
<font color="#FFFF00">The way that Josh has been talking</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">about her has been really positive.</font>

39:42.960 --> 39:46.159
<font color="#11FF11">They are both each other's type as</font>
<font color="#11FF11">well, which makes it easier.</font>

39:46.160 --> 39:48.919
<font color="#00FFFF">Wes and Laura, come on.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">They are great together.</font>

39:48.920 --> 39:50.999
<font color="#00FFFF">They are probably really compatible.</font>

39:51.000 --> 39:53.359
<font color="#FFFF00">Really compatible.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Fuck that test, mate.</font>

39:53.360 --> 39:55.280
<font color="#FFFF00">We both know that anyway.</font>

39:56.440 --> 39:59.239
<font color="#11FF11">I think Wes and Laura have been too</font>
<font color="#11FF11">perfect.</font>

39:59.240 --> 40:03.079
<font color="#11FF11">With Jack and Dani,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">they have had their bumps</font>

40:03.080 --> 40:05.839
<font color="#11FF11">and ups and downs, but that is what</font>
<font color="#11FF11">a real relationship is.</font>

40:05.840 --> 40:08.199
<font color="#11FF11">Wes and Laura have had, like,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">nothing.</font>

40:08.200 --> 40:10.519
<font color="#FFFF00">Hayley and Charlie.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">They are not compatible.</font>

40:10.520 --> 40:13.079
<font color="#00FFFF">She said she doesn't want to be with</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">him whatsoever.</font>

40:13.080 --> 40:16.279
<font color="#11FF11">From my point of view,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">it should be Eyal and Megan.</font>

40:16.280 --> 40:17.839
<font color="#FFFF00">Same.</font>

40:17.840 --> 40:22.159
<font color="#FFFF00">I genuinely don't know if Eyal is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">being genuine towards Megan because</font>

40:22.160 --> 40:25.879
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel like he has come on a bit</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">too full on.</font>

40:25.880 --> 40:28.559
<font color="#FFFF00">When Megan has come in,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">he has jumped</font>

40:28.560 --> 40:30.840
<font color="#FFFF00">on that opportunity</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">as a safety net.</font>

40:32.160 --> 40:34.439
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't think Hayley deserves</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to be here</font>

40:34.440 --> 40:36.719
<font color="#00FFFF">because I don't think she knows</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">what she wants.</font>

40:36.720 --> 40:39.519
<font color="#FFFF00">That is not fair on Charlie.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Charlie wants to find someone.</font>

40:39.520 --> 40:41.919
<font color="#00FFFF">I just wish Hayley wasn't coupled up</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with Charlie.</font>

40:41.920 --> 40:45.399
<font color="#11FF11">Megan and Eyal. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I don't really get</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the whole thing with them.</font>

40:45.400 --> 40:48.079
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't think Megan is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">into him</font>

40:48.080 --> 40:50.639
<font color="#FFFF00">as much as she has probably</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">said she is.</font>

40:50.640 --> 40:54.479
<font color="#FFFF00">I know she is your friend, but it is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">still one of them.</font>

40:54.480 --> 40:57.719
<font color="#11FF11">I know, but everyone is my friend</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and I don't want to do it.</font>

40:57.720 --> 41:00.519
<font color="#00FFFF">OK, Eyal and Megan.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Brand-new.</font>

41:00.520 --> 41:05.879
<font color="#FFFF00">Before the recoupling, it was in the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">balance who she was going to pick.</font>

41:05.880 --> 41:07.879
<font color="#FFFF00">I like them both.</font>

41:07.880 --> 41:11.599
<font color="#00FFFF">I think they could also get to know</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">each other and bond more.</font>

41:11.600 --> 41:16.999
<font color="#11FF11">Josh and Georgia. Georgia is too</font>
<font color="#11FF11">over the top of everything.</font>

41:17.000 --> 41:19.239
<font color="#11FF11">If you are here to find love, just</font>
<font color="#11FF11">chill out.</font>

41:19.240 --> 41:21.039
<font color="#11FF11">Spend time with the person you are</font>
<font color="#11FF11">with</font>

41:21.040 --> 41:23.639
<font color="#11FF11">and don't be jazz hands, do you</font>
<font color="#11FF11">know what I mean?</font>

41:23.640 --> 41:25.239
<font color="#11FF11">Calm down.</font>

41:25.240 --> 41:27.799
<font color="#11FF11">That is not the question, is it?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">It is who is compatible.</font>

41:27.800 --> 41:29.719
<font color="#FFFF00">Who is compatible within their</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">couples?</font>

41:29.720 --> 41:34.320
<font color="#11FF11">It is not the question, just because</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I think she is a fake bitch.</font>

41:36.520 --> 41:39.279
<font color="#00FFFF">Megan and Eyal.</font>

41:39.280 --> 41:42.639
<font color="#FFFF00">They seem pretty decent.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">They are very loved up.</font>

41:42.640 --> 41:45.039
<font color="#00FFFF">I must say, there's a lot of Eyal...</font>

41:45.040 --> 41:47.399
<font color="#00FFFF">A lot of their affection is Eyal</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">going</font>

41:47.400 --> 41:49.959
<font color="#00FFFF">and taking her hand and him</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">kissing her.</font>

41:49.960 --> 41:52.399
<font color="#FFFF00">I have also seen Megan,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">she will sit with him</font>

41:52.400 --> 41:55.239
<font color="#FFFF00">and cuddle him and be with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">him, and stuff like that.</font>

41:55.240 --> 42:00.119
<font color="#11FF11">Sam and Alex, they are not in a</font>
<font color="#11FF11">romantic situation.</font>

42:00.120 --> 42:03.079
<font color="#FFFF00">I think that goes without being</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">said.</font>

42:03.080 --> 42:05.479
<font color="#11FF11">Is that just the obvious decision?</font>

42:05.480 --> 42:08.280
<font color="#11FF11">Can you imagine not having Sam here?</font>

42:10.320 --> 42:13.079
<font color="#00FFFF">Alex has put himself out there and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">tried with me.</font>

42:13.080 --> 42:15.559
<font color="#00FFFF">It is just unfortunate for him that</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">every time you</font>

42:15.560 --> 42:19.079
<font color="#00FFFF">like someone, they</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">are going to someone else.</font>

42:19.080 --> 42:22.239
<font color="#FFFF00">Samira and Alex, obviously I love</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">them</font>

42:22.240 --> 42:24.599
<font color="#FFFF00">as individuals, but as it showed in</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the</font>

42:24.600 --> 42:28.239
<font color="#FFFF00">challenge today, they are in a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">couple and the least compatible.</font>

42:28.240 --> 42:33.359
<font color="#FFFF00">They stated they will never go</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">further than friends.</font>

42:33.360 --> 42:35.439
<font color="#11FF11">I just think that Alex and Samira,</font>

42:35.440 --> 42:39.159
<font color="#11FF11">even though there is no natural</font>
<font color="#11FF11">chemistry there,</font>

42:39.160 --> 42:41.639
<font color="#11FF11">they have got a really good chance</font>

42:41.640 --> 42:45.759
<font color="#11FF11">of meeting someone and they are very</font>
<font color="#11FF11">compatible as people.</font>

42:45.760 --> 42:47.720
<font color="#00FFFF">Georgia and Josh...</font>

42:49.360 --> 42:54.719
<font color="#FFFF00">I think she is a bit too much for</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Josh. Josh is 26. She is 20.</font>

42:54.720 --> 42:56.759
<font color="#00FFFF">I think both of them, if the right</font>

42:56.760 --> 42:59.479
<font color="#00FFFF">guy or girl comes in, I think their</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">heads could turn.</font>

42:59.480 --> 43:01.639
<font color="#11FF11">Samira and Alex do not have the</font>
<font color="#11FF11">connection.</font>

43:01.640 --> 43:05.079
<font color="#11FF11">I wish that they really did click</font>

43:05.080 --> 43:07.959
<font color="#11FF11">with someone in here because they</font>
<font color="#11FF11">are both beautiful people.</font>

43:07.960 --> 43:11.039
<font color="#FFFF00">Hayley is not in it. Hayley does not</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">like him like that.</font>

43:11.040 --> 43:14.479
<font color="#00FFFF">I think he is beginning to realise</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">as well. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I think he is.</font>

43:14.480 --> 43:17.520
<font color="#00FFFF">He is beginning to realise this is</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">not gonna work out.</font>

43:18.960 --> 43:22.559
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, God.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Are you happy?</font>

43:22.560 --> 43:24.680
<font color="#11FF11">We have made a decision.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah?</font>

43:29.440 --> 43:32.199
<font color="#FFFF00">I think Wes and Laura.</font>

43:32.200 --> 43:34.359
<font color="#00FFFF">And Megan and Eyal.</font>

43:34.360 --> 43:37.119
<font color="#00FFFF">You still happy with that?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm still happy with that.</font>

43:37.120 --> 43:39.160
<font color="#00FFFF">Decision.</font>

43:43.600 --> 43:49.679
<font color="#11FF11">I would like to pick Hayley and</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Charlie. Josh and Georgia.</font>

43:49.680 --> 43:52.719
<font color="#FFFF00">I think I agree.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Shall we send the text?</font>

43:52.720 --> 43:54.920
<font color="#FFFF00">It is not an easy thing to do.</font>

43:57.080 --> 43:59.479
<font color="#00FFFF">We have definitely both decided on</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Alex and Samira.</font>

43:59.480 --> 44:02.719
<font color="#00FFFF">Not because of the people they are,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">but they don't have compatibility.</font>

44:02.720 --> 44:07.160
<font color="#11FF11">And then Eyal and Megan. You want to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">go with those two? Yeah?</font>

44:08.600 --> 44:13.799
<font color="#11FF11">Better send this flipping text and</font>
<font color="#11FF11">get it over with. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I'm so sad now.</font>

44:13.800 --> 44:16.120
<font color="#11FF11">Fuck sake.</font>

44:18.320 --> 44:20.599
<font color="#FFFF00">Hayley and Charlie.</font>

44:20.600 --> 44:24.199
<font color="#FFFF00">And Sam and Alex.</font>

44:24.200 --> 44:26.720
<font color="#00FFFF">Do you want to send it?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">You can send it.</font>

44:31.880 --> 44:35.079
<font color="#11FF11">Basically, we think we will go for</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Sam</font>

44:35.080 --> 44:37.719
<font color="#11FF11">and Alex because they are not in</font>
<font color="#11FF11">a romantic way.</font>

44:37.720 --> 44:41.599
<font color="#11FF11">Hayley and Charlie because Hayley is</font>
<font color="#11FF11">not into it.</font>

44:41.600 --> 44:46.080
<font color="#11FF11">Everyone else, we think</font>
<font color="#11FF11">are pretty legit. Can you do it?</font>

44:50.600 --> 44:53.239
<font color="#FFFF00">I am going for Samira and Alex.</font>

44:53.240 --> 44:55.079
<font color="#00FFFF">I think I definitely agree with</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that.</font>

44:55.080 --> 44:57.079
<font color="#00FFFF">I think the other one is Eyal</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and Megan.</font>

44:57.080 --> 45:01.679
<font color="#FFFF00">Same. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I think that is the final two</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">from us. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> We will agree on that.</font>

45:01.680 --> 45:04.319
<font color="#FFFF00">We will text the text.</font>

45:04.320 --> 45:06.800
<font color="#00FFFF">You can do that bit.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Shh, I'm texting.</font>

45:08.840 --> 45:11.999

of being dumped from the island.

45:59.120 --> 46:01.759

and Samira and Alex as the
least compatible couples.

say.

46:09.560 --> 46:11.799

Don't forget you are voting for the
couple you want to save.

46:19.560 --> 46:22.840
