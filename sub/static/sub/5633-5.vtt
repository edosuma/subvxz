10:52.486 --> 10:55.620
For centuries, our family
has made a daily offering

10:55.622 --> 10:58.456
of a special donut
to a slumbering

10:58.458 --> 10:59.991
underwater sea creature,

10:59.993 --> 11:03.662
so that he does not rise
and destroy us all.

11:03.664 --> 11:06.965
(both laughing)

11:06.967 --> 11:08.166
He is foolish!

11:08.168 --> 11:10.769
So foolish!
(laughs)

11:10.771 --> 11:12.637
Doesn't mean
you are not special.

11:12.639 --> 11:13.838

Now I have all eternity
to talk to you.

11:51.043 --> 11:52.410
Oh.

11:55.981 --> 11:57.649
Now we will
no longer have anyone

11:57.651 --> 11:59.984
uselessly floating donuts
in the ocean.

11:59.986 --> 12:02.420
They have made
our fish fat and ugly.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.589
Pathetic.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.333

12:15.335 --> 12:16.901
All right, calm down, children.

12:16.903 --> 12:20.238
Probably just excitement
over the cherry blossoms.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.040
Of course, the cherry blossoms!

the old man was right!

12:36.556 --> 12:38.423
Legitimate
difference of opinion.

12:39.892 --> 12:42.193
Professor,
how do we stop him?

12:42.195 --> 12:43.528
Fear not!

12:43.530 --> 12:45.597
Without the
buoyancy of water,

12:45.599 --> 12:48.233
it is physically impossible
for any creature that large

12:48.235 --> 12:50.101
not to collapse under
its own weight.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.603
It's a simple matter of--

12:51.605 --> 12:53.138

13:33.313 --> 13:35.413

So much farmland you can walk on
without hurting your feet.

Ah, thank you.

14:02.008 --> 14:05.009
So, the key to this movie is
it's so cheap it's funny.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.011
Then just think how
popular it would be

14:07.013 --> 14:09.180
if we spent a fortune
remaking it.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.682
We'll make millions!

14:10.684 --> 14:12.817
After spending
hundreds of millions!

14:12.819 --> 14:16.187

All we can do
is avoid him easily!

15:23.188 --> 15:24.188
It's a total bomb.

15:24.190 --> 15:26.024
We only sold one ticket.

15:26.026 --> 15:28.059
Oh, I didn't buy
my ticket for this.

15:28.061 --> 15:30.895
I just wanted to get a good seat
for the next <i>Star Wars.</i>

15:30.897 --> 15:32.864
Which will stink
to high heaven.

15:32.866 --> 15:34.098
There's only one thing
we can do.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.400
Dump everything at sea

15:35.402 --> 15:37.035
and say we lost it
for insurance purposes.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.569
Aw, yeah, that's
moviemaking, Steve.

15:38.571 --> 15:40.838

been hiking for hours

16:28.088 --> 16:30.655
and you two haven't spotted
a single butterfly.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.123
I thought we were
hunting owls.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.658
Well, you haven't
done that, either!

17:13.633 --> 17:16.134
Fine, but you'll follow me
with the camera, right?

17:16.136 --> 17:17.502
'Cause the important thing
these days

your brain give you?
