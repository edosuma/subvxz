00:14.828 --> 00:18.551
Man: Ah. Okay. Come closer, come closer.

00:18.551 --> 00:20.550
Right there. That looks great. Perfect.

00:20.551 --> 00:21.550
And happiness.

00:21.551 --> 00:24.550
Can Rodrigo's eyes come out to play?

00:24.551 --> 00:26.550
No. No, they'll stay in.

00:26.551 --> 00:28.550
Ah. Okay, the glasses stay on.

00:28.551 --> 00:30.751
Uh, Hendrik, get the maestro a baton.

00:31.551 --> 00:33.550
Thank you.

00:33.551 --> 00:35.550
Happiness. That... That
uh... That looks great.

00:35.551 --> 00:37.550
You ever held one of those before?

00:37.551 --> 00:40.550
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

00:40.551 --> 00:42.751
And, maestro, conduct!

00:43.551 --> 00:46.550
With passion.

00:46.551 --> 00:47.550
You have ten shots.

00:47.551 --> 00:49.751
Happiness.

00:51.551 --> 00:52.550
That was eight.

00:52.551 --> 00:53.550
You only have two left.

00:53.551 --> 00:55.550
W-What?

00:55.551 --> 00:56.550
You have two left.

00:56.551 --> 00:57.550
We just started.

00:57.551 --> 00:59.751
You want passion?

01:03.551 --> 01:04.751
[shutter clicks]

01:08.551 --> 01:11.751
This is the best photograph
I've ever taken.

_

01:20.551 --> 01:22.550
...is they permeate your essence.

01:22.551 --> 01:23.550
I am so sorry.

01:23.551 --> 01:25.550
The maestro's not usually like that.

01:25.551 --> 01:27.550
He's just, um...

01:27.551 --> 01:29.550
He's under a bit of stress lately.

01:29.551 --> 01:32.550
No, no, no. It's all happiness, brah.

01:32.551 --> 01:34.550
He was fantastic.

01:34.551 --> 01:36.550
There we are. Now give a look to the clock.

01:36.551 --> 01:38.550
Turn back time with your eyes.

01:38.551 --> 01:41.550
Yes. There we are. You're not
going to be deterred, are you?

01:41.551 --> 01:42.550
So let me ask you,

01:42.551 --> 01:44.550
how does your personal
life inform your work?

01:44.551 --> 01:46.550
- Uh...
- Maestro.

01:46.551 --> 01:47.550
Hmm? Oh, thank you.

01:47.551 --> 01:48.550
Sure.

01:48.551 --> 01:51.550
- I've never thought about that.
- Yeah.

01:51.551 --> 01:53.550
I don't think about those things.

01:53.551 --> 01:55.550
I actually find them quite idiotic.

01:55.551 --> 01:57.550
Maestros.

01:57.551 --> 01:59.550
Can't live with them,

01:59.551 --> 02:03.550
can't run a major orchestra without them.

02:03.551 --> 02:05.550
Thank you for being part
of the photo shoot.

02:05.551 --> 02:09.550
Listen Cynthia, you're an
asset to this orchestra

02:09.550 --> 02:11.550
in so many ways, even more so now

02:11.551 --> 02:14.550
that you're chairwoman of
the Players' Committee.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.760
Orchestra admires you so,

02:16.761 --> 02:19.550
as do I.

02:19.551 --> 02:20.550
That's great to hear

02:20.551 --> 02:22.550
because I would love your support

02:22.551 --> 02:23.911
in the upcoming negotiations.

02:26.551 --> 02:28.550
We have a lot in common, you and I.

02:28.551 --> 02:34.469
We're both fans of genius,
conductors specifically.

02:34.470 --> 02:37.550
You were a fan of Karzoff in Moscow

02:37.551 --> 02:40.550
and then of dear Thomas from '95 to '98

02:40.551 --> 02:41.913
when he was at the London Phil,

02:41.914 --> 02:43.550
and then Carlotta Di Gozzi...

02:43.551 --> 02:45.550
It's so hard to find great
female conductors...

02:45.551 --> 02:50.550
and then of Thomas again.

02:50.551 --> 02:52.550
And they were fans of mine,

02:52.551 --> 02:54.550
not that it's any of your business.

02:54.551 --> 02:57.550
[Rodrigo shouting in Spanish]

02:57.551 --> 02:58.550
He's quite a handful.

02:58.551 --> 03:02.550
Do you see this trench in my forehead?

03:02.551 --> 03:03.551
This... This is new.

03:03.552 --> 03:06.550
These strong genius big shots,

03:06.551 --> 03:09.550
they're just... they're just really

03:09.551 --> 03:11.550
overgrown babies, aren't they?

03:11.551 --> 03:13.550
Throwing tantrums. "I want this.

03:13.551 --> 03:15.550
Give me that. You don't understand me."

03:15.551 --> 03:17.550
Even if you do understand them,

03:17.551 --> 03:20.550
they don't believe that you do.

03:20.551 --> 03:22.550
But not with you, Cynthia.

03:22.551 --> 03:24.550
They know you understand them,

03:24.551 --> 03:26.751
therefore they trust you.

03:27.551 --> 03:31.550
This dynamic could be very helpful to us.

03:31.551 --> 03:33.550
What do you want?

03:33.551 --> 03:35.550
Stay close to him.

03:35.551 --> 03:38.550
In return, my door will always be open.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.427
These are challenging times.

03:40.428 --> 03:43.550
We both want this institution to survive.

03:43.551 --> 03:45.550
The difference is you look at the orchestra

03:45.551 --> 03:46.819
and you see an institution.

03:46.820 --> 03:49.550
I see musicians, and I
think the audience...

03:49.551 --> 03:51.550
Audience sees one thing: our new maest...

03:51.551 --> 03:54.550
I am not going to talk about her, okay?

03:54.551 --> 03:56.550
No! Okay?

03:56.551 --> 03:58.550
Is there a problem over here, maestro?

03:58.551 --> 04:00.550
No. We found the solution.

04:00.551 --> 04:01.550
Oh, great.

04:01.551 --> 04:02.550
The interview's over.

04:02.551 --> 04:04.052
Ciao.

04:04.053 --> 04:07.177
Hailey, put that sign up now.

04:07.178 --> 04:08.751
Hah. Huh?

04:19.551 --> 04:21.550
I didn't sleep with Rodrigo.

04:21.551 --> 04:22.550
Anything else?

04:22.551 --> 04:24.550
I really want to take lessons from you.

04:24.551 --> 04:26.550
What are you, some kind of masochist?

04:26.551 --> 04:27.550
Maybe. I don't know.

04:27.551 --> 04:29.550
Don't you kind of have
to be to play the oboe?

04:29.551 --> 04:32.550
Look, you're the best there
is in New York City,

04:32.551 --> 04:35.550
and you're the only shot I have
at coming any closer to this.

04:35.551 --> 04:37.550
You're right, I am the best,

04:37.551 --> 04:39.550
and some of that rubs off on my students,

04:39.551 --> 04:41.550
but I'm no miracle worker.

04:41.551 --> 04:43.550
I'm good. I'm better than I showed,

04:43.551 --> 04:45.550
and I'm willing to make sacrifices.

04:45.551 --> 04:48.550
What do you want, a medal? I'm expensive.

04:48.551 --> 04:50.550
I don't care.

04:50.551 --> 04:51.550
$400 an hour.

04:51.551 --> 04:52.550
Holy shit. What?

04:52.551 --> 04:54.550
No. Uh, I can make that work.

04:54.551 --> 04:55.550
When do we start?

04:55.551 --> 04:57.550
I didn't say yes.

04:57.551 --> 04:59.751
If I feel like it, I'll let you know.

05:00.551 --> 05:01.551
What the hell is going on?

05:01.552 --> 05:03.550
My commute takes 45 minutes.

05:03.551 --> 05:05.550
- What?- This is bullshit.

05:05.551 --> 05:08.550
"Rehearsal today is cancelled"?

05:08.551 --> 05:10.751
"Bring a sweater"?

05:12.551 --> 05:15.550
Okay, you're going to want to
pull the corners of your mouth in

05:15.551 --> 05:17.550
so that you're fully supporting the reed.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.550
- Good. That's really good.
- [cell phone jangles]

05:19.551 --> 05:20.751
Uh...

05:24.551 --> 05:26.550
And then you're going to want to inhale

05:26.551 --> 05:28.550
and then create a steady stream of air.

05:28.551 --> 05:31.550
Hailey, Tim's finally
going to get circumcised.

05:31.551 --> 05:33.550
He's going in tomorrow.
Should we bring him soup?

05:33.551 --> 05:37.550
Lizzie, meet Duncan. He's 12. Put pants on.

05:37.551 --> 05:38.550
Oh, for fuck's sake.

05:38.551 --> 05:40.751
- Sorry about that.
- [Cell phone jangles]

05:41.551 --> 05:42.751
Not a problem.

05:44.551 --> 05:45.550
You going to get that?

05:45.551 --> 05:46.550
- No.
- [jangling]

05:46.551 --> 05:48.550
- Is it Alex?
- Yeah.

05:48.551 --> 05:49.550
Zip it and crow.

05:49.551 --> 05:51.032
What, you're ignoring him now?

05:51.033 --> 05:53.550
- You're 12? No offense.
- None taken.

05:53.551 --> 05:56.550
Do you want me to do something about this?

05:56.551 --> 05:57.550
No. Absolutely not.

05:57.551 --> 05:58.938
I will deal with it later

05:58.939 --> 06:01.550
when I'm not teaching a lesson.

06:01.551 --> 06:03.550
There are two things that are bugging you.

06:03.551 --> 06:05.550
1, she was grinding her
crotch in his face,

06:05.551 --> 06:07.550
and 2, they slept together,
like, months ago,

06:07.551 --> 06:09.550
and they may still be boning.

06:09.551 --> 06:10.760
[bad note]

06:10.761 --> 06:12.550
Sorry.

06:12.551 --> 06:14.022
Duncan, I think that's actually

06:14.023 --> 06:15.550
all the time that we have for today.

06:15.551 --> 06:17.550
Well, here's the thing.

06:17.551 --> 06:19.550
My mom won't pay for
lessons with you anymore,

06:19.551 --> 06:22.751
so I was hoping I could pay with this.

06:24.551 --> 06:25.550
A stamp?

06:25.551 --> 06:27.550
It's a brown embossed SG 57

06:27.551 --> 06:30.550
from Great Britain, circa 1847.

06:30.551 --> 06:33.550
I predict it to be worth five lessons.

06:33.551 --> 06:35.550
Duncan, I don't even know
what to do with this.

06:35.551 --> 06:39.550
You eBay it. That shit's worth $500.

06:39.551 --> 06:42.751
Jesus. Deal.

06:43.551 --> 06:44.550
Oh.

06:44.551 --> 06:45.991
The course of conflict isn't determined

06:45.992 --> 06:47.551
by the person who initiates

06:47.552 --> 06:49.550
but by the person who responds.

06:49.551 --> 06:52.550
My parents do marriage counseling,

06:52.551 --> 06:54.550
even though they're not together anymore.

06:54.551 --> 06:56.751
Thank you, Duncan.

06:58.344 --> 06:59.550
- I'll see you soon.
- Bye.

06:59.551 --> 07:01.550
Don't talk to any
strangers on the subway.

07:01.551 --> 07:02.751
I won't.

07:09.551 --> 07:11.550
Betty: I shared an apartment
with two Hell's Angels

07:11.551 --> 07:13.550
down here in '79. Good times.

07:13.551 --> 07:15.751
Hi, Betty.

07:18.551 --> 07:20.550
- Hi.
- Hey.

07:20.551 --> 07:21.550
Oh. Let me...

07:21.551 --> 07:22.550
You will tell me next time

07:22.551 --> 07:24.550
he decides to pull
something like this, yes?

07:24.551 --> 07:26.751
I'll do my best, yes.

07:31.551 --> 07:33.550
Bienvenue!

07:33.551 --> 07:35.550
Welcome to the session.

07:35.551 --> 07:37.550
Hailey.

07:37.551 --> 07:38.550
Help me out.

07:38.551 --> 07:39.751
Everyone.

07:41.551 --> 07:42.550
Does this open?

07:42.551 --> 07:44.550
No, that's why I...

07:44.551 --> 07:46.751
Oh. Okay. All right.

07:48.551 --> 07:51.550
This is so goddamn wrong
on so many goddamn levels,

07:51.551 --> 07:54.550
- I can't even tell you.
- Welcome to the session, Bob.

07:54.551 --> 07:57.550
Oh. Cynthia, you're
wearing the bracelet, eh?

07:57.551 --> 07:58.550
Of course.

07:58.551 --> 08:00.550
Ah, and swift like a gazelle.

08:00.551 --> 08:04.550
I have metal kneecaps, so I
might as well use them, right?

08:04.551 --> 08:05.751
Nice one, D.D.

08:08.470 --> 08:10.751
- Mikael. Warren Boyd.
- Yeah.

08:11.551 --> 08:13.550
You're-you're... You're in.

08:13.551 --> 08:15.550
Svetlana, ah, watch it.

08:15.551 --> 08:16.550
Hello, Rennie.

08:16.551 --> 08:17.550
Hello. Hey, take care.

08:17.551 --> 08:19.550
You okay? Watch it, watch it

08:19.551 --> 08:21.877
because I can... Yeah. I can help.

08:23.551 --> 08:25.751
Now it's your turn. Go ahead.

08:27.551 --> 08:28.550
Watch it, watch it, watch it.

08:28.551 --> 08:29.550
- Hailey.
- Sorry.

08:29.551 --> 08:31.550
No, it's okay, it's okay.

08:31.551 --> 08:32.751
Okay.

08:34.551 --> 08:35.549
Oh.

08:35.551 --> 08:36.549
Yeah. You're free.

08:36.551 --> 08:37.549
Oh. Thanks.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.549
Okay.

08:39.551 --> 08:40.751
Good.

08:45.551 --> 08:48.550
Hello, Edward. I didn't
know you were a boxer.

08:48.551 --> 08:50.551
No, I'm not, but I train as one.

08:50.552 --> 08:52.550
I got a sparring partner and everything.

08:52.551 --> 08:53.550
Knocked him out by accident.

08:53.551 --> 08:55.751
He's fine now. He's a trouper.

08:56.551 --> 08:59.550
Mr. Beiben, your usual.

08:59.551 --> 09:01.550
No celery, extra carrots,
and raw Brussel sprouts.

09:01.551 --> 09:03.550
May I get you anything else?

09:03.551 --> 09:04.840
Uh, just bring my water, please.

09:04.841 --> 09:05.550
Thank you, Joel.

09:05.551 --> 09:06.869
Also, we're not going to eat this bread.

09:06.870 --> 09:08.550
Yes, sir.

09:08.551 --> 09:09.550
So, Gloria,

09:09.551 --> 09:12.550
I have got a 2:00
parent-teacher conference,

09:12.551 --> 09:14.550
so I'm afraid I'm going to have
to cut right to the chase.

09:14.551 --> 09:15.841
You look lovely, as always, by the way.

09:15.842 --> 09:17.549
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:17.551 --> 09:18.793
I was being interviewed yesterday

09:18.794 --> 09:20.551
for the Times business section,

09:20.552 --> 09:22.550
and the reporter mentioned
that our boy Rodrigo

09:22.551 --> 09:24.550
walked out on a Sunday magazine profile.

09:24.551 --> 09:26.550
Yeah, it's being rescheduled.

09:26.551 --> 09:29.919
I don't care. It was embarrassing. To me.

09:31.551 --> 09:33.550
I mean, Thomas Pembridge may
have lost his new car smell,

09:33.551 --> 09:36.550
but at least he was easy to drive.

09:36.551 --> 09:38.550
Edward, bringing Rodrigo here

09:38.551 --> 09:40.550
was a risk we knowingly took

09:40.551 --> 09:43.550
because the risk itself was
something we could market.

21:40.551 --> 21:41.550
to come with me to Florida.

21:41.551 --> 21:42.550
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.550
Why?

21:44.551 --> 21:45.551
Well, so I guess he was

21:45.552 --> 21:47.550
a modeling agent or something,

21:47.551 --> 21:48.551
came to my showcase

21:48.552 --> 21:51.550
and needed a dancer for a body spray ad,

21:51.551 --> 21:53.550
and yeah, he, uh, scouted me for the gig.

21:53.551 --> 21:55.550
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

21:55.551 --> 21:57.550
Wow. Um...

21:57.551 --> 22:00.550
uh...

22:00.551 --> 22:02.550
Florida.

22:02.551 --> 22:03.711
Um...

22:04.551 --> 22:06.751
I can't.

22:08.551 --> 22:09.550
I have, um...

22:09.551 --> 22:12.550
an oboe lesson at 6:30 in the morning.

22:12.551 --> 22:14.550
I know that sounds really ridiculous,

22:14.551 --> 22:16.550
but the lady who's giving them to me

22:16.551 --> 22:17.760
is really amazing,

22:17.761 --> 22:19.551
and she just, like, fucking hates my guts,

22:19.552 --> 22:21.550
so it's the only time that she agreed...

22:21.551 --> 22:23.550
- Yeah, yeah.
- ...to teach me, so...

22:23.551 --> 22:24.751
- Okay.
- Yeah.

22:25.551 --> 22:26.550
6:30 in the morning.

22:26.551 --> 22:28.550
Yeah. I know. It's horrible.

22:28.551 --> 22:29.550
It sucks.

22:29.551 --> 22:31.302
But it's really a big deal,

22:31.303 --> 22:34.751
and I just... I got to focus right now.

22:36.551 --> 22:38.550
Yeah, I'd love to hang out when I get back.

22:38.551 --> 22:40.550
- Okay.
- Yeah.

22:40.551 --> 22:42.751
All right. Have fun with your lessons.

22:54.551 --> 22:57.751
Gloria, can I tell you something?

22:59.551 --> 23:01.550
You should have seen them out there.

23:01.551 --> 23:04.260
It was incredible. It was beautiful.

23:04.261 --> 23:05.550
They were... Oh, my God.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.550
I've retained legal counsel
from Leonard Bernstein...

23:07.551 --> 23:09.550
not that one...

23:09.551 --> 23:11.550
who reminds me

23:11.551 --> 23:15.550
your O1 visa could be affected

23:15.551 --> 23:16.550
by your little adventure.

23:16.551 --> 23:18.551
You could be deported, Rodrigo.

23:18.552 --> 23:22.550
Oh, and I thought you'd like to see this

23:22.551 --> 23:23.550
from our friend Union Bob.

23:23.551 --> 23:26.550
An invoice for $80,000 overtime,

23:26.551 --> 23:28.550
including a performance bonus.

23:28.551 --> 23:32.052
Ah, it's okay. I'll pay it.
I'll pay it personally.

23:32.053 --> 23:33.551
Okay, but that's not the point.

23:33.552 --> 23:36.550
It's a small price to pay
for something so valuable.

23:36.551 --> 23:38.255
Really, it was the first time that I felt

23:38.256 --> 23:39.550
that we were getting at
something, you know?

23:39.551 --> 23:41.550
That we were reaching some place.

23:41.551 --> 23:44.550
Rodrigo, I am a true believer

23:44.551 --> 23:49.550
in your art, your attitude,
your excitement, you.

23:49.551 --> 23:51.550
I'm going to be straight with you.

23:51.551 --> 23:55.550
Our orchestra is in serious
financial trouble,

23:55.551 --> 23:57.550
deep financial trouble.

23:57.551 --> 24:00.550
You understand what I'm saying?

24:00.551 --> 24:02.751
Yeah.

24:04.551 --> 24:05.751
Yes, Gloria.
