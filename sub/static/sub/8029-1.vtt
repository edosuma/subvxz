00:44.360 --> 00:47.113
As I walk through the Valley
of the Shadow of Death

00:47.280 --> 00:50.450
I take a look at my life
and realize there's nothin' left

00:50.575 --> 00:53.119
'Cause I been blastin'
and laughin' so long

00:53.286 --> 00:56.289

00:56.414 --> 00:59.125
I really hate to trip
but I gotta loc

00:59.250 --> 01:01.961

the little homies wanna be like

01:05.047 --> 01:08.885

01:14.849 --> 01:20.730

01:26.861 --> 01:32.241
We keep spending most our lives
living in a gangsta's paradise

01:32.366 --> 01:35.078
Look at the situation

01:35.244 --> 01:38.081
I can't live with no hope

01:38.247 --> 01:41.084
So I gotta be down
with the hood team

01:41.250 --> 01:44.128
Took much television-watchin'
got me chasin' dreams

01:44.295 --> 01:47.173
I'm a educated fool
with money on my mind

01:47.340 --> 01:50.134
Got my tin in my hand
and a gleam in my eye

01:50.301 --> 01:53.179

01:53.304 --> 01:55.890

We keep spending most our lives
living in a gangsta's paradise

02:44.689 --> 02:47.608
Power and the money
Money and the power

02:47.775 --> 02:50.653
Minute after minute
Hour after hour

02:50.778 --> 02:54.907
Everybody's runnin', but half

02:55.074 --> 02:56.492
But I don't know what's cookin'

02:56.617 --> 02:59.537
They say I got to learn
but nobody's here to teach me

02:59.704 --> 03:02.790
lf they can't understand it
how can they reach me

03:02.957 --> 03:05.084

Oh. No, only-- only good.

that we have an applicant...

04:12.527 --> 04:16.697

term of, of supervised student teaching.

04:38.553 --> 04:42.807
Why did you stop so close
to being certified?

04:42.932 --> 04:47.061
Well, I met my husband and
started working for his company.

04:47.228 --> 04:48.563
Uh, w-we're divorcing.

05:04.579 --> 05:08.166
One of our, uh, academy
teachers, Mrs. Shepherd, left,

05:08.332 --> 05:11.961
and since then we've had
three substitute teachers.

05:12.128 --> 05:15.882

Mrs. Johnson is going to be

06:17.985 --> 06:20.154
I'm afraid Mrs. Gingrich
is no longer with us.

06:20.279 --> 06:23.825
- Carla, they--

06:23.991 --> 06:27.495

Yeah, yeah. No,

06:52.228 --> 06:55.940
Fly ho's and chains
and swingin' thangs

06:56.065 --> 06:58.484
Save me

06:58.609 --> 07:01.362
Just another young nigger

07:01.487 --> 07:04.365
Just a-havin' thangs

07:04.532 --> 07:07.577
Fly ho's and chains
and swingin' thangs

07:07.744 --> 07:09.579
Why must I feel like that

07:11.247 --> 07:14.625
Just another young nigger
havin' thangs

07:18.796 --> 07:20.631
lt's to your right.

07:22.842 --> 07:26.721
I guess Miss Shepherd's lesson
plans will be in her desk.

07:28.264 --> 07:30.141
Very possibly.

07:36.022 --> 07:38.357
This is your classroom.

07:43.112 --> 07:46.449
- Noisy bunch, aren't they?
- Yes, but if you stand there
long enough,

07:46.574 --> 07:48.242
they'll usually quiet down.

07:48.409 --> 07:50.244
Don't try and shout over them.

07:51.204 --> 07:53.164
Right. Thanks.

07:55.875 --> 07:59.087
Louanne.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.923
- I'm right next door.
- I wrote this about my life because
it's my shit you never heard before

08:02.090 --> 08:04.592
- Why don't you live in my world
That's my point that you
been searchin' for

08:04.759 --> 08:08.096
I know that you need to relax
A supported fact

08:08.221 --> 08:10.598
A little history
and history of government--

08:10.765 --> 08:12.767
lmmobilizing your physical
and your brain

08:12.892 --> 08:14.769
With the emotion
of subliminal motivation

08:14.936 --> 08:18.314
- Look at that!
- No, no, no. Not yours.

08:18.439 --> 08:21.984
- White bread.
- Snappin' my fingers
appropriately when I rip

08:22.151 --> 08:25.029
You get flipped and then I pass
the microphone to my homegirl Chris

08:25.154 --> 08:28.699
Now I see you runnin'
I'm comin', boom, how stunnin'

08:28.866 --> 08:30.952
Fast as I step
Got to earn a big rep

08:31.077 --> 08:33.913
For huntin' homies like deer
Crack a beer and some heads

08:34.080 --> 08:37.792
Then go find another poor person
I can trap in my cage for a night

08:37.917 --> 08:40.336
Let loose, fool, run
'Cause my first meal is done

08:40.461 --> 08:44.382
- May I have your attention, please?
- How long y'all been together?

08:44.507 --> 08:46.426
You run, I'll shoot
'Cause your homies said 'boo' to me

08:46.592 --> 08:49.053
Your life is a joke
Smoked by the A to the K

08:49.178 --> 08:52.807
You went to bed without a trace
lnfrared dot marks the spot

08:52.932 --> 08:55.977
-So duck or find your ass shot
-What happened to Miss Shepherd?

08:56.144 --> 08:58.521
- Better not do that.
- What?

08:58.646 --> 09:03.818
- What happened to Miss Shepherd?
- Ooh, no, she ain't askin' about
Miss triflin'-ass Shepherd.

09:03.985 --> 09:06.154
You playin' yourself.
Playin' yourself.

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!
Listen up! Yo, listen up!

09:10.241 --> 09:12.577
White Bread wanna know
what happened to Miss Shepherd.

09:15.455 --> 09:17.415
We killed the bitch.

09:17.540 --> 09:19.917
Kick it, kick it, kick it,
kick it, kick it. Hey!

09:20.042 --> 09:21.961
I was beginning to like
the puta!

09:22.128 --> 09:25.882
Ohh! No, no, no.
Everybody, everybody. Emilio ate her.

09:28.885 --> 09:31.095
Bullshit.

09:38.519 --> 09:41.481
- That bitch was too ugly to eat.
- Yeah!

09:42.815 --> 09:45.109
Fed her to my dogs.

09:53.117 --> 09:54.911
But I'll eat you.

10:05.129 --> 10:07.548
What is your name?

10:07.715 --> 10:10.384
Emilio Ramirez.

10:13.054 --> 10:17.809
- Now, Emilio!
- Emilio, you in trouble!

10:25.191 --> 10:29.237
Emilio! Emilio! Emilio!
Emilio! Emilio!

10:29.362 --> 10:32.448
- Emilio! Emilio! Emilio! Emilio!
- Oh, my God.

10:32.615 --> 10:35.451
Come on, come on, come on,

what they're like. Come on.

10:35.618 --> 10:39.539
Emilio! Emilio! Emilio! Emilio!
Emilio! Emilio! Emilio! Emilio!

10:56.305 --> 10:58.933
Madison surrendered
to the nationalists.

11:01.185 --> 11:06.691
Hamilton himself could have already have
composed the message that embraced--

11:11.195 --> 11:13.823
Donna. Donna,
take over the class.

11:19.787 --> 11:21.622
Shut up!

11:28.671 --> 11:30.548
What happened to Miss Shepherd?

11:30.715 --> 11:32.925
- Well, she quit.
- Why?

11:33.092 --> 11:36.220
Well, she was a very
high-strung individual.

11:36.345 --> 11:38.306
What, did she have a breakdown?

11:38.431 --> 11:40.641
No. She quit before that.

11:40.808 --> 11:43.227
One of the substitutes,
she had a breakdown.

11:43.394 --> 11:46.939
- That's how they weed them out.
- Who are these kids, rejects from hell?

11:47.064 --> 11:51.486
No. They're bright kids with
little or no educational skills...

11:51.611 --> 11:54.697
and what we politely call
a lot of social problems.

11:54.864 --> 11:56.699
Damn it, Griffith,
you could've warned me!

11:56.824 --> 12:00.953
Hey, Louanne,
you said you wanted to teach.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.997
- Now, is that a load of bull or what?
- No!

12:03.164 --> 12:04.582
- So teach.
- I ca--
- What?

12:04.749 --> 12:07.001
I can't teach them!

12:07.126 --> 12:11.506
Yes, you can. All you gotta do
is get their attention.

12:13.758 --> 12:15.384
Or quit.

12:23.684 --> 12:26.020
I'm back!

12:51.170 --> 12:55.633
"She decided that if Brian broke a rule
she would utilize these consequences:

12:55.758 --> 12:59.429
The first time he broke a rule his name
would be put on the board."

13:13.609 --> 13:17.613
This is the life

13:20.992 --> 13:25.204
This is the life

13:25.329 --> 13:28.708
This is the life

13:32.754 --> 13:34.422
Okay, you little bastards.

13:34.589 --> 13:36.048
- Come on
- Put your back into it

13:36.174 --> 13:37.258
- Come on
- Put your back into it

13:38.134 --> 13:39.927
- Come on
- Put your back into it

13:40.052 --> 13:41.637
- Come on
- Put your back into it

13:41.763 --> 13:44.307
- Come on
- Put your back into the beat

13:44.474 --> 13:45.975
Achieve the goals
in which you seek

13:46.142 --> 13:47.727
Don't let nobody
steer you wrong

13:47.852 --> 13:49.604
Or you'll be singin'
that same old song

13:49.729 --> 13:51.939
- How someone's always holdin you down
- There she is.

13:52.064 --> 13:53.649
- Just keep your two feet on the ground
- Girl, you didn't get enough yesterday?

13:53.775 --> 13:56.486
And when you come you be direct
'cause punks get no respect

13:56.611 --> 13:59.155
- My eyes to the west side
- East side, west side

14:09.123 --> 14:12.335
How you doin'? Yeah.

14:16.672 --> 14:21.177
Hey, everybody, everybody, look!
A cowboy!

14:21.344 --> 14:24.931
Put your back into it
Put your back into it

14:25.056 --> 14:29.894
- Put your back into it
- Don't talk about-- Don't talk
about yourself like that.

14:30.061 --> 14:33.356
"I am a--"

14:33.481 --> 14:37.318
- Shut up! Y'all sound
like them fifth-graders!
- You shut up!

14:39.445 --> 14:43.991
"Does... anyone...

14:44.158 --> 14:45.660
know--"

14:48.621 --> 14:52.083
- What's "karate"?
- Karate, you stupid asshole.

14:52.250 --> 14:56.462
- You're so stupid.
- You're a Marine? A for-real Marine?

14:56.587 --> 14:59.757
- Discharged, but yes.
- Estupido.

14:59.924 --> 15:02.760
I'll try some karate
with you, Miss Johnson.

15:05.847 --> 15:09.892
I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed
to touch a student.

15:10.017 --> 15:13.396
But if you really think you know
what you're doin', come on up here.

15:13.521 --> 15:16.566
Hey, sounds like a challenge to me,
ése. You'd better get up there.

15:16.732 --> 15:20.737
Oh, I know what I'm doin'.
There's no sense doin' it though
if you can't touch me.

15:22.405 --> 15:25.950
Okay, anybody else know
any karate? What about you?

15:26.117 --> 15:29.454
- Durrell Chang Chang.
- I know some motherfuckin' karate.

15:31.873 --> 15:33.332
Whoo! Durrell, gimme it!

15:33.458 --> 15:35.334
- Durrell.
- Shit.

15:38.421 --> 15:43.050
- What about you? You know any karate?
- Raul. Yeah, I know enough.

15:43.217 --> 15:45.136
- Okay, Raul.
- Go on up there.

15:45.303 --> 15:47.513
Come on up here.

15:47.638 --> 15:50.183
- All right. Yeah, shit. I'm
gonna take that motherfucker.
- Come on, Nacho.

15:50.349 --> 15:53.060
Shit. All right.
Come on, let's go, ése.

15:53.227 --> 15:54.729
Let's go.

16:05.782 --> 16:07.700
Shit!

16:07.867 --> 16:10.078
You guys--
Wait, wait, wait. Whoa!

16:10.203 --> 16:13.414
You guys don't know shit.

16:13.581 --> 16:16.125
-"l don't know shit," man.
I know what I'm doin', lady.
-You don't even know any throws.

16:16.292 --> 16:21.798
Now, I heard that a Marine
can kill a man with his, uh,
bare hands. ls that true?

16:21.923 --> 16:24.092
Absolutely.

16:25.093 --> 16:27.261
Oh, shit.

16:31.015 --> 16:33.643
Okay, h-here's how it starts.

16:33.810 --> 16:37.396
Um, okay, where's a-- Can you two move
that desk down there a little bit?

16:41.109 --> 16:44.445
Um, okay, everything is
slow motion at first.

16:44.612 --> 16:47.281
- Um, Durrell.
- Yeah.

16:47.448 --> 16:51.327
Okay, you, um, you move into
Raul like you're gonna hit him.

16:51.494 --> 16:53.371
Yeah, I can do that.

16:53.496 --> 16:54.789
- Okay.
- Nacho.

16:54.914 --> 16:59.001
Now, Raul, you're gonna
step into Durrell...

16:59.168 --> 17:01.921
and you're gonna
grab his wrist, okay?

17:02.088 --> 17:08.136
You're gonna turn your body
away from him so that your butt
is in his stomach. Okay?

17:08.301 --> 17:11.472
Fuck you!
Get the fuck off me, man!

17:11.597 --> 17:14.308
What you gonna do?

17:14.434 --> 17:16.810
- Man, you wish, homes! You wish, man!
- Bring it on, homes!

17:16.935 --> 17:19.396
- Fuck you! Get your hands off me!
- Bring it on, Nacho.
- You wish, man!

17:19.521 --> 17:23.108
- Bring it on.
- Now, it's a hip throw.
lt's a hip throw.

17:23.276 --> 17:26.779
- Okay, take your fighting
stance again, okay.
- Nacho.

17:26.945 --> 17:29.031
Okay, grab his wrist.
Okay.

17:29.198 --> 17:31.325
Now, now this time,
as you move in,

17:31.492 --> 17:34.996
you're gonna take this hand,
you're gonna grab onto this shoulder.

17:35.163 --> 17:36.998
Okay? Ready?

17:38.291 --> 17:40.209
Oh, shit!

17:40.376 --> 17:44.213
Thank you! Hey! Hey!
All right!

17:44.338 --> 17:47.508
- Ow, man! I'll kick your
motherfuckin' ass, ése!
- Sucker! Sucker!

17:55.099 --> 17:58.227
Well, that was "A" work.

17:58.352 --> 18:00.229
You'd make good Marines.

18:01.647 --> 18:04.942
ln fact, from this moment,

18:05.068 --> 18:07.695
each one of you
is like an inductee...

18:07.862 --> 18:11.115
- Who's a duck?
- with a clean record.
- Quack.

18:11.282 --> 18:16.287
- So, if you wanna pass,
- Quack quack.

18:16.454 --> 18:18.289
all you have to do is try.

18:22.251 --> 18:24.295
Oh, homes.

18:26.631 --> 18:29.842
Because at this point,
everyone has an "A."

18:30.009 --> 18:32.428
- What?
- ls she serious?

18:37.183 --> 18:39.936
But it's up to you to keep it.

18:41.521 --> 18:45.399
-Bullshit.
-Yo, why don't you shut up, man.

18:45.525 --> 18:49.070
What if it ain't bullshit? Ain't
never had no fuckin' "A" before.

18:51.697 --> 18:53.282
I once knew a man
who couldn't read

18:53.449 --> 18:55.368
He said it ain't no thang
'cause I graduated twice

18:55.535 --> 18:56.744
With the game I possess

18:56.911 --> 18:58.287
Bulletproof vest
to the chest

18:58.454 --> 19:00.790
But when his kids needed help
to prepare for a test

19:00.915 --> 19:03.751
lt was stress 'cause Pops
didn't achieve any academics

19:03.918 --> 19:06.129
And true, indeed
This problem is an epidemic

19:06.295 --> 19:09.549
Who want to work five long hard days
through it and get taxed

19:09.674 --> 19:11.134
So that's a message
for your mind

19:11.259 --> 19:14.720
The story's been told
about a thousand times

19:14.887 --> 19:16.431
So here's a message
for your mind

19:16.556 --> 19:19.725
One thousand-one
One thousand-two

19:19.851 --> 19:21.644
So here's a message
for your mind

19:29.277 --> 19:31.154
Morning.

19:35.241 --> 19:39.245
- Okay, today we are going
to conjugate some verbs.
- What?

19:39.412 --> 19:41.414
Hey, what about karate?

19:41.539 --> 19:44.500
Well, I can't just teach you karate.
I'll show you another hold next week.

19:44.625 --> 19:47.336
Get outta here!

19:55.303 --> 19:57.638
Belt it out, too.
I wanna hear it.

20:06.606 --> 20:09.525
We eat green beans for dinner.
What you do with 'em?

20:09.650 --> 20:11.736
"We eat green beans for dinner."

20:11.903 --> 20:15.656
- Okay--
- Hey, Pam. Pam!

20:18.785 --> 20:20.661
Ye-- Yo, Chris!

20:29.670 --> 20:31.297
Hey. Hey. Hey, what's up?

20:37.804 --> 20:40.348
Hey, man, it's not
a big deal, okay?

20:47.063 --> 20:48.523
ls that true?

20:48.689 --> 20:51.442
lf we wanna die?
Shit, no.

20:51.609 --> 20:54.904
We want you to die.

20:55.029 --> 20:59.367
- ls that true?
- Well, if it was between
you and us, hell yeah.

20:59.492 --> 21:02.453
- Okay.
- Hey! Hey! I don't care
if I live or die!

21:04.872 --> 21:07.375
- What about that?
- Suicide, man.
- What's all this bullshit with dying?

21:07.500 --> 21:11.546
- You want us dead?
- No, darlin', but I do
want you to keep your "A."

21:11.671 --> 21:13.548
So, no, I'm gonna make it
real easy on you, okay?

21:13.714 --> 21:18.928
All you have to do is tell me the verb
that makes this sentence true.

21:19.053 --> 21:22.056
We choose to do some karate.

21:22.181 --> 21:24.976
- Yeah, right.
- Okay, give me a verb
instead of "choose."

21:25.143 --> 21:27.812
- We're going to die?
- We must die, okay.

21:27.937 --> 21:32.567
- Okay, "we must die." ls "must"
a verb? Can you, uh--
- No, "must" ain't no verb.

21:32.734 --> 21:37.238
- Can you "must" something?
- Yeah. I must piss right now.
You'd better believe it.

21:44.078 --> 21:47.915
Okay, what verb that we used
today is the most powerful?

21:48.082 --> 21:50.668
- Die.
- Piss.

21:50.793 --> 21:53.087
Oh, you so stupid!

21:55.214 --> 21:58.050
- Choose.
- Choose.

21:58.176 --> 21:59.927
- What's your name?
- Callie.

22:00.094 --> 22:02.430
Callie, why?

22:02.555 --> 22:05.475
Because that's the difference between
owning your life and being afraid.

22:05.641 --> 22:07.268
Saying "l choose"
no matter what.

22:07.435 --> 22:09.270
You mean, like a guy's got
a gun to your head...

22:09.437 --> 22:12.106
and he's pulling the trigger
and you say, "l choose to die"?

22:12.190 --> 22:17.153
No, you ain't choosin' to die,
but you can choose to die
without screaming, right?

22:17.320 --> 22:19.447
I mean, you could always
choose somethin'.

22:19.614 --> 22:21.783
- Not where I live.
- Shit.

22:21.949 --> 22:23.993
Did you read that somewhere
in this class?

22:26.996 --> 22:32.794
No. ln our class we readin' this book
called My Darling, My Hamburger.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.629
- From this.
- My what?

22:34.796 --> 22:37.632
- My Darling, My Hamburger.
- Hamburger?

22:39.509 --> 22:42.929
Possessive pronoun, noun,
possessive pronoun.

22:43.096 --> 22:45.807
- Oh, watch it, girl.
- Let's see.

22:45.973 --> 22:47.850
E-Excuse me.

22:48.017 --> 22:49.811
- Excuse me, Miss Johnson.
- Uh-- Oh, yes.

22:49.936 --> 22:53.106
Would you stop by the principaI's office
before your next class, please?

22:53.272 --> 22:56.401
Mr Grandey would like
to speak to you.

22:56.526 --> 22:59.529
The principal!

22:59.654 --> 23:02.990
Oooh, White Bread in trouble!

23:23.136 --> 23:25.888
Yes. I'll talk to you later.

23:26.013 --> 23:28.474
Bye-bye.

23:28.599 --> 23:32.478
Miss Johnson, this is an office.
We knock before we enter.

23:33.646 --> 23:35.690
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:35.815 --> 23:37.191
Please.

23:43.156 --> 23:47.702
Now, Miss Johnson,
I'm taking into consideration
the fact that you're new...

23:47.827 --> 23:51.873
and therefore don't know that teaching
karate is against school policy...

23:51.998 --> 23:55.918
and can lead to a lawsuit
in case of an injury.

23:56.085 --> 23:59.213
But you can avoid this kind of error--
you simply follow the curriculum...

23:59.338 --> 24:01.716
dictated by
the Board of Education.

24:04.844 --> 24:09.140
Well, um, sir, that's
almost impossible, um--

24:09.265 --> 24:12.852
Most of my students don't
even know what a verb is.

24:13.019 --> 24:14.604
lf you're going to teach them,

24:14.729 --> 24:19.484
I'm sure there's a better sentence
than "We choose to die."

24:19.609 --> 24:22.904
I'm sure there are, but I--
I-l needed a sentence that
would get their attention...

24:23.029 --> 24:27.533
- Mmm.
- and, well, it had to
be better than this.

24:29.744 --> 24:33.206
Miss Johnson, that is the approved
curriculum for second period.

24:33.372 --> 24:35.500
Your class.

24:35.625 --> 24:39.045
Now, I know the newer the teacher,
the smarter she is,

24:39.170 --> 24:44.675
but I-I'm afraid you're just
going to have to go along
with our policies,

24:44.842 --> 24:47.678
even if you don't
agree with them.

24:49.847 --> 24:52.141
- All right?
- Mm-hmm.

24:53.434 --> 24:55.394
What a fuckin' idiot.

25:00.525 --> 25:02.902
- Griffith.
- Don't let them get to you.

25:03.069 --> 25:06.197
I'm not. I-ln fact, I'm about to
challenge the entire curriculum.

25:06.322 --> 25:11.619
- lf I could just find the paper
in the Xerox room.
- You can't. There isn't any.

25:11.744 --> 25:14.288
- What do you mean?
- I mean there isn't any.

25:14.414 --> 25:18.584
I mean, we're out of Xerox paper and art
paper and we're short on pencils.

25:18.751 --> 25:22.630
But we do have plenty of students.
I guess that, uh, balances things out.

25:25.341 --> 25:26.801
Thanks.

25:34.434 --> 25:36.727
Another fuckin' idiot.

25:36.853 --> 25:39.772
No, I can't run, I can't hide
from all this pressure

25:39.897 --> 25:42.984
lf I sell out, that means
I'm coppin' to a lesser charge

25:43.109 --> 25:46.070
- And whenever there's a will
baby, there's a way
- Shit!

25:46.195 --> 25:49.115
Each one teach one I always say
the murder rate is risin'

25:49.282 --> 25:53.327
Society ain't scarin' me
Life is like a puzzle
Ain't no tellin' when they'll bury me

25:53.453 --> 25:57.290
- Problems, problems
How are we gonna solve 'em
- So, what's on today's lesson plan?

25:57.415 --> 26:01.335
A little kickboxing?
Some, uh, target practice, huh?

26:01.502 --> 26:04.505
No. My own little
secret weapon.

26:04.672 --> 26:07.425
Problems, problems
How are we gonna solve 'em

26:10.970 --> 26:14.682
Okay, so, "never" is--

26:14.849 --> 26:16.976
- lt's a verb!
- Adverb! Adverb!
- Adverb! Adverb!

26:17.143 --> 26:19.228
Adverb! Fantastic!

26:19.353 --> 26:21.689
- Whoo!
- You guys'll be reading poetry soon.

26:21.856 --> 26:24.233
- You guys are sharp.
- Oh, my--

26:24.400 --> 26:26.069
- Whoa!
- Okay.

26:28.154 --> 26:30.323
- Homeboy!
- King of the calle!

26:30.490 --> 26:32.700
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

26:35.912 --> 26:38.581
- Sit down.
- Honourable sensei. Hmm.

26:38.664 --> 26:42.543
lt's obvious that "homeboy"
is a noun.

26:44.837 --> 26:46.714
Noun is correct!

26:46.881 --> 26:49.634
Well, give me my damn candy bar.

26:49.759 --> 26:51.177
- Whoo!
- Thank you.

26:51.344 --> 26:54.555
Boy, poetry will be a piece
of cake for this crowd.

26:54.722 --> 26:58.768
Yo, how come you keep sayin' poetry?
What's poetry got to do with this shit?

26:58.893 --> 27:01.604
Poetry? WelI--

27:01.771 --> 27:04.565
Because if you can read poetry,
you can read just about anything, hon.

27:05.399 --> 27:08.319
- When you're ready for poetry,
you're ready for bear.
- I say bring on the bear!

27:08.486 --> 27:11.781
- I'm always ready for bear. Shit.
- I'm always ready to see you bare.

27:11.948 --> 27:15.993
- Whoa!
- Oh, shut up, you stupid!
- Oh, yeah? Ohh! Ohh!

27:16.119 --> 27:20.206
Well, okay, here's the bear.

27:21.332 --> 27:23.376
So what the fuck is that?

27:23.501 --> 27:29.298
- I just happen to have copies
of-of-- of a poem...
- Wait for me! Shit!

27:29.424 --> 27:33.094
- That's okay.
- written by the greatest poet.

27:33.261 --> 27:35.263
My Darling, My Hamburger.
How's that?

27:37.974 --> 27:39.809
- Okay, here's the deal.
- She was joking about the bear.

27:39.976 --> 27:44.188
When we finish this assignment,
I am gonna take...

27:44.313 --> 27:46.065
all of you...

27:46.232 --> 27:48.151
to a place that has...

27:48.317 --> 27:51.863
the highest parachute jumps,

27:52.029 --> 27:53.948
the biggest roller coaster,

27:54.115 --> 27:56.075
the best rides,

27:56.242 --> 27:58.911
the most delicious hot dogs,

27:59.078 --> 28:00.663
the hardest games...

28:00.830 --> 28:04.792
and the best prizes
in the world.

28:04.917 --> 28:07.003
- You're kiddin'.
- For real?

28:07.170 --> 28:10.047
- And we don't gotta pay for it?
- Huh?

28:10.214 --> 28:13.009
- And we don't gotta pay for it?
- Not a penny.

28:13.176 --> 28:16.137
So then, who pays?

28:16.304 --> 28:18.723
The Board of Education.

28:18.890 --> 28:20.975
- Lord, did you hear that?
- I don't believe it.

28:22.602 --> 28:25.813
- Sound good?
- Hey!

28:28.274 --> 28:30.109
That's bullshit, man!

28:31.944 --> 28:33.404
I'm sorry?

28:35.406 --> 28:38.326
Since when has the Board of Education
done anything for us, huh?

28:38.493 --> 28:41.329
Yeah, man, we fuckin'
barely get lunch.

28:42.830 --> 28:45.583
Well, I'm sorry you feel
that way, Emilio.

28:48.044 --> 28:50.296
Good.

28:50.463 --> 28:54.842
- Uh, Durrell, you wanna read
the first four lines?
- Oh, man, you trippin', man.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.928
I ain't readin'. You trippin'.

29:00.098 --> 29:02.725
- Okay, how about the f--
- You've got to read it.
- How about the first line?

29:04.560 --> 29:07.230
I'm scared to death, motherfucker,
all right? That's all.

29:18.825 --> 29:22.703
- Move slowly to the right, people.
- Yep, yep

29:22.829 --> 29:25.623
Miss Johnson.

29:25.748 --> 29:28.376
- You better be for real.
- Yep, yep

29:31.879 --> 29:34.173
- Yep, yep
- Miss Johnson?

29:34.298 --> 29:36.509
Yes, Callie?

29:36.634 --> 29:39.929
lf you wanna get the class
to listen, get Emilio.

29:42.348 --> 29:44.225
- Yep, yep
- lt's all right

29:44.392 --> 29:47.353
- lt's all right
- As you may have heard

29:47.520 --> 29:49.105
- Yeah
- To smoke a fat one

29:49.272 --> 29:52.108
- To smoke a fat one
- And drink a Thunderbird

29:52.233 --> 29:55.027
- Drink a Thunderbird
- lt's okay

29:55.153 --> 29:58.030
- lt's okay
- To play this loud

29:58.197 --> 30:04.078
- Mister DJ, don't mean
to sweat you down
- Wait

30:04.245 --> 30:07.457
- I'll get you, you little fucker.
- Yep

30:07.623 --> 30:10.418
- Poetry?
- Poetry, yeah.

30:10.543 --> 30:12.962
- These kids?
- Why not these kids?

30:13.087 --> 30:15.298
Well, hey, go for it.

30:15.465 --> 30:18.885
No, but I gotta find a gimmick
first, you know. Something
that'll grab their attention.

30:19.051 --> 30:21.095
- Who's your favourite poet, Griffith?
- My favourite?

30:21.220 --> 30:24.056
- Oh, there are so many.
How do I choose?
- I'm serious.

30:24.223 --> 30:26.893
Mmm. Serious. Okay.

30:26.976 --> 30:29.353
- Big D. Dylan.
- Get out!

30:29.520 --> 30:31.355
Why not?

30:31.522 --> 30:33.900
Well, I don-- He's n-- You know,
he's not for everybody.

30:34.025 --> 30:36.944
I mean, he's a little
long-winded, don't you think?

30:37.070 --> 30:39.280
I suppose that's 'cause
he wrote drunk.

30:39.447 --> 30:41.199
He had a drinking problem?

30:41.324 --> 30:43.659
Well, the guy's Welsh.
There ain't a lot to do there.

30:43.826 --> 30:46.079
I thought he was from Minnesota.

30:46.204 --> 30:49.373
You know, if the guy's your
favourite poet, you might want
to read up on him a little bit.

30:49.540 --> 30:51.626
He was Welsh and
he drank himself to death.

30:51.751 --> 30:54.921
Dead? He's not dead.
I saw him yesterday on MTV.

30:57.340 --> 30:59.675
You saw Dylan Thomas on MTV.

31:01.094 --> 31:02.845
No. Bob Dylan.

31:02.970 --> 31:05.223
Oh--

31:05.389 --> 31:08.476
-Bob Dylan? Ohh!
-He looked dead. He looked dead.

31:08.643 --> 31:12.105
- Ohh!
- Hey, Mr Tambourine Man

31:12.271 --> 31:15.358
Play a song for me

31:16.192 --> 31:19.153
"Hey, Mr Tambourine Man--"

31:19.320 --> 31:21.322
- Tambourine!
- Tambourine!
- Tangerine.

31:21.447 --> 31:24.158
"T-Tambourine Man,

31:24.283 --> 31:27.495
Play a song for me

31:27.662 --> 31:31.791
I'm not sleepy and there is
no place I'm going to"

31:31.916 --> 31:33.584
Wow, he can read.

31:33.709 --> 31:35.628
Thank you. Taiwana?

31:38.089 --> 31:40.967
The next three lines, Taiwana.

31:41.134 --> 31:43.261
"Hey, Mr Tambourine Man

31:43.386 --> 31:45.721
Play a song for me

31:45.888 --> 31:49.475
ln the jingle-jangle morning
I'll come following you"

31:49.600 --> 31:51.561
- Good.
- All right.

31:51.686 --> 31:53.521
- Yes.
- What does that mean?

31:53.688 --> 31:56.023
What do you think it means?

31:56.149 --> 31:58.109
What, some guy's
got a tambourine...

31:58.234 --> 32:01.654
and this other guy wants him to
play it 'cause he can't sleep.

32:01.821 --> 32:04.449
- Okay.
- Yeah, but how come he want
to play the tambourine?

32:04.615 --> 32:07.285
Don't he got a radio or somethin'?
You know what I'm sayin'?

32:07.368 --> 32:12.331
Well, you kn-- That's a good point.
I mean, i-i-it's-- it's a weird choice.

32:12.498 --> 32:16.794
So, what if I told you
that Mr Tambourine Man...

32:16.919 --> 32:18.671
is a code name?

32:18.796 --> 32:22.133
- A code name for what?
- James Bond.

32:22.300 --> 32:24.802
- A drug dealer.
- ls it?

32:24.969 --> 32:26.804
Well, a lot of people think so.

32:26.929 --> 32:30.016
You know, this song is from the '60s,
when you couldn't sing about drugs,

32:30.183 --> 32:32.268
so they had to make up codes.

32:32.393 --> 32:37.899
So what was the code?
What does "Hey, Mr Tambourine Man
Play a song for me" mean?

32:38.024 --> 32:41.069
- Well, you figure--
- "Play a song for me"
means "give me the stuff."

32:41.194 --> 32:43.946
Yeah, it's like that nigger
been out drinkin' all night
and smokin' some shit...

32:44.072 --> 32:46.449
and everybody broke out on his
ass, you know what I'm sayin'?

32:46.616 --> 32:50.661
And he's high-- he's still high,
but he's kinda low and shaky.
You know-- "jingle-jangle."

32:50.828 --> 32:54.082
Yeah, and he needs something, like
a big hit of crack or cocaine and shit.

32:54.207 --> 32:56.250
He's crazy, okay?

32:56.375 --> 32:59.378
So, what do you think, Emilio?
Do you think that Raul is right?

33:02.006 --> 33:06.094
- All right, it's too
personal to discuss.
- What?

33:06.219 --> 33:09.555
You mean you choose not to
participate in the discussion?

33:09.680 --> 33:12.975
- Boy's too slick.
- Not about somethin' so personal.

33:17.939 --> 33:20.441
Wanna draw for it?

33:20.566 --> 33:22.610
What?

33:22.777 --> 33:26.489
High card, you don't have to
discuss anything.

33:28.241 --> 33:31.244
Why do I gotta draw for it?
That's the way it is now.

33:49.762 --> 33:52.265
Listen to this.

33:52.390 --> 33:55.977
Name one of the most influential
presidents of the 20th century.

33:56.144 --> 33:58.980
- Roosevelt.
- Simple, right?

33:59.105 --> 34:02.608
Wrong.
A history teacher's nightmare.

34:04.110 --> 34:06.154
How about Snoop Doggy Dogg
for an answer?

34:06.320 --> 34:09.741
Joe Montana. Winston Churchill.

34:11.617 --> 34:14.954
But this-- this is the best.

34:15.079 --> 34:19.083
"l will not answer this question on the
grounds that it is culturally biased...

34:19.208 --> 34:21.627
against individuals
such as myself."

34:23.880 --> 34:27.049
Actually, for this answer I'm
gonna give him partial credit.

34:29.135 --> 34:31.679
Louanne, you lose your
sense of humour, it's over.

34:33.097 --> 34:35.349
Uh, here.
New pictures of the rug rats.

34:35.516 --> 34:38.603
- Oh, God. People are supposed
to ask first, Griffith.
- Shut up.

34:40.897 --> 34:44.025
Ohh. They look like Maggie.
Thank God.

34:44.192 --> 34:47.695
Oh, I don't know. Harry with his thumb
in his mouth, he kinda looks like me.

34:47.862 --> 34:50.864
ls that his thumb?
I thought that was a cigarette.

34:50.989 --> 34:53.201
- How is Maggie?
- Good.

34:53.326 --> 34:55.369
She wants you to come over
for dinner.

34:55.495 --> 34:59.874
We had some fun times, you and Maggie
and me and-- what's his name?

35:01.501 --> 35:03.628
- I remember.
- Yeah.

35:06.089 --> 35:10.384
I remember too. That's why it's
hard for me to come to dinner.

35:12.887 --> 35:14.889
- Seeing anybody?
- No.

35:16.808 --> 35:19.227
How do you do that? You walk around
with a bag over your head?

35:19.393 --> 35:22.146
- No.
- Louanne, it's over six months.

35:22.271 --> 35:24.148
I'm not ready, Hal.

35:27.276 --> 35:32.573
You know, I thought you guys
always stuck together. What are
you sitting here with me for?

35:32.698 --> 35:37.703
You know, he was my best friend,
Louanne. "Was" is the operative word.

35:39.163 --> 35:41.499
He isn't worth your spit.

35:50.383 --> 35:52.385
What was that for?

35:52.552 --> 35:55.972
Just tell Maggie
she's a lucky lady, Griffith.

35:56.097 --> 35:59.767
Yeah, when they made me they
broke the mold. Both of them.

36:04.105 --> 36:06.065
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning.

36:14.240 --> 36:16.284
We gotta stop meeting like this.

36:19.871 --> 36:22.749
You sound awful.

36:22.915 --> 36:24.500
I refuse to take
medical advice...

36:24.625 --> 36:29.088
from somebody who eats Cheetos
at 8:00 in the morning.

36:29.255 --> 36:33.134
Yeah, well, you shouldn't smoke.
Listen to that cough!

36:34.969 --> 36:36.304
You know--

36:38.514 --> 36:40.975
- I'll see you inside.
- You're gonna finish
the cigarette, aren't you?

36:41.142 --> 36:44.687
No, I'm not. Really.
Honest. I swear.

36:44.854 --> 36:48.149
Here! Right here! Yeah!

36:59.118 --> 37:01.871
- Guys are off playin' pool.
- You wanna smoke a cigarette?

37:02.038 --> 37:04.707
- I gave you your money, man. 350 bucks!
- Three-fifty?

37:04.791 --> 37:06.959
What are you talkin' about, homes?
Are you callin' me a liar?

37:07.126 --> 37:10.505
- What, do you think I'm fuckin' stupid?
- Yo, man, no.
Don't get loud, motherfucker!

37:10.630 --> 37:13.382
I'm gonna kick your fuckin'
spic ass!

37:13.549 --> 37:16.219
- Fuck you, man!
- Jump back, motherfucker!
- Fight! Fight!

37:16.344 --> 37:19.472
- Get back, get back.
- You fuckin' pendejo!
- Okay, okay, okay!

37:19.639 --> 37:22.350
Back off! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

37:22.475 --> 37:24.727
- iPuto!
- One of you makes a move,
I will call security!

37:24.894 --> 37:27.563
- Aw, bullshit!
- Big fuckin' deal.
- They don't care.

37:27.688 --> 37:32.360
Okay, get to your classes.
Okay. lt's all over. Move!

37:37.740 --> 37:41.035
-You are stronger than these two
put together, and you know it!
-Bullshit, man!

37:41.202 --> 37:42.578
- iVato!
- He wishes, man!

37:46.082 --> 37:51.003
You could all be expelled if I report
this to the office, and you know that.

37:51.129 --> 37:55.758
Okay, if you give me your word that
it ends here, I'll forget it.

37:55.883 --> 37:58.511
ls it over?

37:58.636 --> 38:01.556
Yeah.

38:01.681 --> 38:03.558
How about you?

38:03.683 --> 38:06.727
- Yeah, simón.
- Absolutely.

38:10.398 --> 38:13.901
Okay, I trust you.
Now get to your classes.

38:15.403 --> 38:17.947
See you later, puto.

38:18.114 --> 38:20.199
Catch you later, ése.

38:27.081 --> 38:30.710
lf you hit those kids,
you'll pay for it. I swear.

38:38.634 --> 38:41.012
Get to your class
and behave yourself.

38:43.765 --> 38:46.184
You shouldn't have done that.

38:46.350 --> 38:50.271
- Oh? Why not?
- 'Cause you just shouldn't
mess with Emilio.

38:50.438 --> 38:53.816
Raul knows that if you make a deal
with Emilio and you fuck up on him,

38:53.983 --> 38:55.818
you get your locker smashed in
with your head.

38:55.943 --> 38:58.446
Everybody knows that.

38:58.571 --> 39:00.948
Well, maybe they'll all have
time to think about it...

39:01.074 --> 39:02.784
before they get to
the locker-smashing stage.

39:02.950 --> 39:05.912
They're gonna fight,
no matter what they tell you.

39:07.747 --> 39:09.957
What do you mean?

39:10.124 --> 39:12.627
When? Now?

39:15.463 --> 39:17.465
Where? Angela! Where?

39:21.427 --> 39:23.137
- Come on, motherfucker! Come on!
- Get him!

39:23.304 --> 39:24.639
Keep fightin'!
Keep kickin' his ass!

39:26.974 --> 39:29.310
Shit! Fuck!

39:31.729 --> 39:32.772
Ohh!

39:38.111 --> 39:39.862
Oh, shit.

39:41.989 --> 39:45.451
- Come on! Fuckin' come on!
- Fuck that!

39:45.618 --> 39:46.953
Shit!

39:50.123 --> 39:52.834
Come on, break it up!
Break it up!

39:53.000 --> 39:56.170
- Get the fuck off me!
- Get outta there!
- iPuto! You motherfucker!

39:56.295 --> 40:00.550
Get back! Now!
Get back! Get back!

40:00.716 --> 40:03.010
All of you! Comin' through!

40:07.181 --> 40:09.517
- Watch your head.
- Kickin', man.

40:09.684 --> 40:13.020
No. Wait a minute. Wait. No, no.
Gimme-- G-- Just give me a minute.

40:16.691 --> 40:18.568
- You promised!
- Yeah, but we had to,

40:18.693 --> 40:21.529
or we couldn't walk around
with our heads up no more.

40:21.696 --> 40:25.241
We got a reputation to protect.
You a Marine. You understand.

40:25.408 --> 40:27.493
Like, if America didn't stand up
everyone would attack it.

40:27.618 --> 40:30.705
Well, in our neighbourhood if you don't
stand up you can't walk down the street,

40:30.830 --> 40:32.999
'cause everyone will attack you,
you know?

40:35.126 --> 40:37.670
Rata, you fuckin' puto.

40:37.837 --> 40:41.048
- Man, I cracked that
motherfucker's head, ése.
- See you in the fuckin

40:44.761 --> 40:46.637
Okay, I see.

40:49.098 --> 40:52.059
And I made it worse and I made you and
Gusmaro look bad in front of everyone...

40:52.185 --> 40:54.395
by saying that Emilio was
stronger than the both of you.

40:54.562 --> 40:57.064
Yeah, well, you thought
you was helpin' us.

40:57.231 --> 41:00.651
Ma'am, I'm sorry. We really have to go.
I gotta get 'em home.

41:43.820 --> 41:45.071
Nasty cut.

41:50.326 --> 41:53.037
You mind telling me what the fight
was about in the first place?

41:53.162 --> 41:54.831
Yeah.

41:58.251 --> 42:02.588
I really would like to know
what happened. I'm not gonna
make any trouble for you.

42:02.755 --> 42:05.925
- I just wanna know, was it worth it?
- Yeah, it was worth it.

42:06.050 --> 42:09.095
- Why?
- Because it felt good
hittin' him in the face.

42:09.220 --> 42:12.306
- I got him good, man.
- Yeah, you like to hit people?

42:12.432 --> 42:14.308
Yeah, I like to hit people.

42:16.811 --> 42:19.313
Why?

42:19.480 --> 42:22.024
You feel angry
a lot of the time?

42:22.191 --> 42:25.069
So now you're gonna
try and psychologize me?

42:25.236 --> 42:28.823
You're gonna try and figure
me out? I'll help you.

42:28.990 --> 42:31.993
I come from a broken home,
and we're poor. Okay?

42:33.494 --> 42:36.330
I see the same fuckin' movies
you do, man.

42:39.959 --> 42:42.462
I would like to help you,
Emilio.

42:42.587 --> 42:46.674
Thank you very much. And how
would you like to do that?

42:46.799 --> 42:50.011
You gonna give me some good
advice? "Just say no"?

42:50.178 --> 42:53.514
You gonna get me off
the streets? Well, forget it!

42:53.639 --> 42:56.726
How the fuck you gonna
save me from my life, huh?

43:03.733 --> 43:05.568
Yep, yep

43:06.694 --> 43:08.571
Karen?

43:08.696 --> 43:11.783
I have three, uh,
student files here...

43:11.908 --> 43:15.161
- and I can't find a phone
number in any of 'em.
- Yep, yep

43:15.328 --> 43:17.538
Well, sometimes they don't
give a number...

43:17.663 --> 43:20.124
- and sometimes
they don't have a phone.
- Yep, yep

43:20.249 --> 43:24.253
- lt's all right
- lt's all right
- As you might have heard

43:24.378 --> 43:27.381
- Yeah
- To smoke a fat one
- To smoke a fat one

43:27.507 --> 43:30.218
- And drink a 'Bird
- A Thunderbird

43:30.384 --> 43:32.553
- lt's okay
- lt's okay

43:32.678 --> 43:35.556
- To play this loud
- Oh, play it loud

43:35.723 --> 43:40.645
Mister DJ, don't mean
to sweat you down

43:40.812 --> 43:42.897
- lt's all right
- lt's all right

43:43.022 --> 43:45.441
- As you may have heard
- Yeah

43:45.608 --> 43:48.152
- To smoke a fat one
- Smoke a fat one

43:48.277 --> 43:53.074
- And drink a 'Bird
- A Thunderbird, now

43:53.241 --> 43:57.578
lt's okay

44:04.961 --> 44:07.338
Come on. Come on.

44:09.006 --> 44:10.341
Do your homework.

44:31.446 --> 44:35.283
- You have a lovely family,
Mrs. Sanchero.
- Thank you.

44:40.413 --> 44:42.790
We know why you're here,
Miss Johnson.

44:44.167 --> 44:47.336
I warned Raul to
stay out of trouble.

44:47.503 --> 44:50.798
He's first in our family to
maybe graduate high school.

44:50.923 --> 44:54.010
- So he gonna get punished big
for what he done.
- N--

44:56.012 --> 44:57.597
Don't you worry about that.

44:57.722 --> 45:00.600
But he didn't do anything wrong.

45:02.310 --> 45:04.479
-But he expelled for three days.
-l know. No, I know.

45:04.645 --> 45:09.275
But he didn't start the fight. He was
defending himself from a bigger boy.

45:09.442 --> 45:11.986
He was protecting himself.

45:12.153 --> 45:14.906
- Uh, why they send him home?
- lt's just school policy.

45:15.073 --> 45:18.326
I-I-lt gives the other boy
time to cool down.

45:18.451 --> 45:20.912
Actually,

45:21.037 --> 45:25.291
I'm here because I just wanted
to tell you both personally...

45:25.416 --> 45:29.378
what a pleasure it's been having
Raul in my class this semester.

45:29.504 --> 45:31.923
You must be very proud.

45:35.134 --> 45:36.844
Yes.

45:37.011 --> 45:39.972
He's, um--
Well, he's very bright...

45:40.139 --> 45:43.518
and funny, articulate.

45:45.561 --> 45:48.648
The truth is, he's--
he's one of my favourites.

46:31.774 --> 46:34.152
Uh, soy Louanne Johnson.

46:40.867 --> 46:42.076
Oh.

46:43.953 --> 46:47.248
"l will not go down underground

46:47.415 --> 46:50.084
'Cause somebody tells me
that death's comin' 'round"

46:51.335 --> 46:53.713
Okay, this is another
Dylan poem.

46:53.838 --> 46:58.050
Now, is that a code, or does
that just mean what it says?

47:06.768 --> 47:08.811
"And I will not carry myself
down to die

47:08.978 --> 47:11.105
When I go to my grave
My head will be high"

47:11.230 --> 47:13.691
"My head will be high."
What does that mean?

47:16.611 --> 47:17.862
Anybody.

47:21.365 --> 47:23.951
Nobody.

47:24.077 --> 47:26.454
ls there something
I should know?

47:27.914 --> 47:29.624
Yeah. I'll tell you.

47:29.791 --> 47:33.461
You ratted on Raul,
Gusmaro and Emilio.

47:33.586 --> 47:36.130
Yeah. You got Emilio
put into detention.

47:36.255 --> 47:38.299
lt wasn't none of your
business, chismosa.

47:38.466 --> 47:40.635
And you got Raul
and Gusmaro suspended.

47:40.760 --> 47:43.054
- Now they're gonna get
their fuckin' asses kicked.
- And you got Emilio--

47:43.221 --> 47:45.348
- Hey, I didn't rat on anybody.
- Wasn't none of your business
anyway, you chismosa.

47:45.473 --> 47:48.726
- Bullshit.
- Let this--
- Told you she was full of shit.

47:48.893 --> 47:52.897
- Snitches get stitches, bitch.
- Do you wanna talk about this?

47:53.064 --> 47:56.484
On you, shit. Whatever
floats your boat, teach.

47:56.609 --> 47:58.861
We don't have no choices
in this room.

47:59.028 --> 48:01.697
Well, if you all feel that strongly
about it, leave the room.

48:01.823 --> 48:04.033
- What?
- Hey, listen.

48:04.200 --> 48:09.914
Nobody's forcing you to be here.
You have a choice.
You can stay, or you can leave.

48:10.039 --> 48:13.000
Lady, why are you playin' this
game? We don't have a choice.

48:13.126 --> 48:16.504
You don't have a choice? You don't have
a choice on whether or not you're here?

48:16.671 --> 48:20.007
No. lf we leave, we don't
get to graduate. lf we stay,
we gotta put up with you.

48:20.174 --> 48:22.218
Well, that's a choice, isn't it?
You have a choice.

48:22.385 --> 48:24.470
You either don't graduate
or you have to put up with me.

48:24.595 --> 48:27.348
lt may not be a choice you like,
but it is a choice.

48:27.515 --> 48:30.643
Man, you don't understand nothin'. l
mean, you don't come from where we live.

48:30.810 --> 48:34.689
- You-- You're not bussed here.
- Do you have a choice
to get on that bus?

48:34.856 --> 48:37.191
Man, you come and live in my
neighbourhood for one week...

48:37.358 --> 48:39.652
and then you tell me
if you got a choice.

48:39.777 --> 48:44.198
There are a lot of people who
live in your neighbourhood who
choose not to get on that bus.

48:44.365 --> 48:47.076
What do they choose to do?
They choose to go out and sell drugs.

48:47.201 --> 48:50.496
They choose to go out and kill people.
They choose to do a lot of other things.

48:50.621 --> 48:52.874
But they choose not to
get on that bus.

48:53.040 --> 48:57.253
The people who choose to get on
that bus, which are you,
are the people who are saying,

48:57.420 --> 48:59.714
"l will not carry myself
down to die

48:59.881 --> 49:02.675
When I go to my grave
My head will be high"

49:02.800 --> 49:05.011
That is a choice.

49:05.178 --> 49:07.513
There are no victims
in this classroom!

49:12.894 --> 49:15.021
Why do you care anyway?
You just here for the money.

49:15.146 --> 49:17.732
Because I make a choice to care.
And, honey, the money ain't that good.

49:17.857 --> 49:20.234
- Whatever.
- Read it again, Miss Johnson.

49:20.359 --> 49:24.238
- What?
- Read those lines you just read again.

49:38.711 --> 49:40.505
"l will not go down underground

49:40.671 --> 49:44.550
'Cause somebody tells me
that death's comin' 'round"

49:48.888 --> 49:51.140
Does that mean
just what it says?

49:52.600 --> 49:56.437
No, it don't mean
just what it says.

49:56.604 --> 49:59.107
Because...

49:59.273 --> 50:01.609
you wouldn't go
under the ground...

50:01.734 --> 50:05.488
if someone told you
death was comin'.

50:05.655 --> 50:09.200
But you would go into the ground
if you were already dead.

50:16.624 --> 50:19.961
Do the rest of you
agree with that?

50:27.468 --> 50:29.345
Well, I kinda agree with it,

50:29.512 --> 50:33.391
but I think
it just means that...

50:33.516 --> 50:35.268
he ain't gonna help death out,
you know?

50:35.435 --> 50:38.104
lt's not like he's just gonna
lay down and wait for it.

50:38.229 --> 50:42.817
I think he's gonna choose-- No,
I think he's gonna make the choice--

50:42.942 --> 50:44.819
to die hard.

50:47.113 --> 50:48.948
Mm-hmm.

50:49.073 --> 50:51.451
- Yeah, I agree with that.
- Yeah, me too.

50:51.576 --> 50:53.494
- That's what it sounds like to me.
- Okay.

50:53.661 --> 50:57.206
Well, what about, uh,
the rest of it? Um--

50:57.331 --> 50:59.333
"When I go to my grave
My head will be high"

50:59.459 --> 51:02.170
"Head will be high."
What does that mean?

51:02.336 --> 51:06.174
- You're gonna die with pride.
- Right.

51:06.299 --> 51:08.843
- See you tomorrow.
- Callie, wait up!

51:30.323 --> 51:34.410
You went to RauI's house last
night, and Gusmaro's too, right?

51:34.535 --> 51:37.121
Mm-hmm.

51:37.288 --> 51:39.457
Yeah, that's what they told me.

51:40.708 --> 51:43.211
That's cool.

51:55.014 --> 51:58.267
Hold up, wait a minute
Don't go there 'cause I ain't with it

51:58.392 --> 52:01.687
Hold up, wait a minute
Don't go there 'cause I ain't with it

52:05.817 --> 52:09.487
What you want
Baby, I got it

52:09.654 --> 52:12.740
What you need
Babe, you got it

52:12.907 --> 52:15.993
All I'm askin'
is for a little respect

52:18.329 --> 52:21.457
Yo, kick it, homes!
What you waitin' for, man?

52:21.624 --> 52:24.752
- Are you trying to steal my $2.50, ése?
- Ah, go, go, go.

52:24.919 --> 52:29.173
Man, that ain't shit.
Go faster, man. Go faster, man.

52:35.012 --> 52:38.057
- Come on, come on
- Faster, man, faster!
- You got to gimme, gimme

52:38.224 --> 52:41.561
- R-E-S-P-E-C-T
- I got to get it, get it

52:41.686 --> 52:44.981
- R-E-S-P-E-C-T
- You got to gimme, gimme

52:45.148 --> 52:48.401
- R-E-S-P-E-C-T
- I got to get it, get it

52:48.526 --> 52:50.236
- R-E-S-P-E-C-T
- Come on, get back.

52:50.403 --> 52:53.448
Are you all right, man? That looked
like a real bitch right then.

52:53.573 --> 52:57.577
Hey, get the fuck
out of there, man. Look at you!
You look like my grandma, man.

53:00.455 --> 53:02.999
- R-E-S-P-E-C-T
- Miss Johnson,

53:03.124 --> 53:06.210
the-- the School Board would have every
right to insist on your dismissal.

53:06.377 --> 53:09.505
You informed no one.
You got no permission slips.

53:09.672 --> 53:14.093
Oh, but there was no one to inform.
All the kids just decided to go to
the amusement park at the last minute.

53:14.260 --> 53:16.929
And then they let me come along.

53:17.054 --> 53:20.224
- Did they pay for you?
- No, I paid for them.

53:23.102 --> 53:26.898
I was just so moved
by the invitation.

53:30.443 --> 53:33.112
This wasn't, by any chance,

53:33.237 --> 53:37.867
their reward for reading
poetry, was it, Miss Johnson?

53:37.992 --> 53:42.705
ln my class, Mr Grandey,
poetry is its own reward.

53:47.877 --> 53:50.713
Angela, would you read
the first line?

53:50.880 --> 53:55.218
"Appetizers. Freshly cut bay shrimp
grilled to perfection."

53:55.384 --> 53:58.971
- This is a Xerox of a menu.
- That is correct.

53:59.138 --> 54:03.142
lt's from The Flowering Peach,
the best restaurant in town.

54:03.309 --> 54:06.395
- Ever hear of it?
- Yeah, we heard of it.

54:06.562 --> 54:08.815
lt's supposed to be like
some special restaurant or somethin'.

54:08.981 --> 54:11.150
Mm-hmm.
So, does it sound good?

54:13.027 --> 54:17.490
Because whoever wins the, uh,
the-- the Dylan-Dylan contest...

54:17.615 --> 54:19.992
- The what?
- goes there for dinner with me.

54:20.118 --> 54:23.079
Hey, what's the Dylan-Dylan
contest about?

54:23.246 --> 54:25.081
Well.

54:27.959 --> 54:30.294
There's Bob Dylan,

54:30.461 --> 54:33.005
who we've been reading.

54:33.172 --> 54:35.007
And then...

54:35.174 --> 54:39.512
there's Dylan Thomas,

54:39.637 --> 54:41.347
who also wrote poems.

54:41.514 --> 54:44.976
lf you can find the poem
written by Dylan Thomas...

54:45.143 --> 54:50.022
that is like a poem
written by Bob Dylan,

54:50.189 --> 54:52.442
you win the Dylan-Dylan contest.

54:52.567 --> 54:57.363
Hey, Mr Tambourine Man
Play a song for me

54:57.530 --> 55:03.536
I'm not sleepy and there
is no place I'm going to

55:03.703 --> 55:08.791
Hey, Mr Tambourine Man
Play a song for me

55:08.958 --> 55:11.377
ln the jingle-jangle morning

55:11.544 --> 55:15.047
I'll come following you

55:27.185 --> 55:32.273
Yo, every fuckin' poem Dylan Thomas
wrote is about death, man.

55:32.440 --> 55:34.650
Now, how we supposed to know
which one to write?

55:34.776 --> 55:38.154
"The sniper laid him low,
and strewed his brains.

55:38.321 --> 55:40.364
One would not think
the greenness of this valley...

55:40.490 --> 55:42.492
could let a day be sick
with so much blood."

55:42.617 --> 55:45.953
Man, that's some Rambo-Schwarzenegger
bullshit you found.

55:46.120 --> 55:47.955
- That's how it's supposed to be, right?
- No.

55:48.122 --> 55:50.333
- There's supposed to be killing shit.
- But it-- But it don't--

55:50.458 --> 55:53.211
But it don't even mean the same as
"l will not go under the ground."

55:55.171 --> 55:57.590
Now you're some sort of
poetic critic, now, right?

55:57.715 --> 55:59.926
- Oh, well, it don't.
- Thank you.

56:00.093 --> 56:02.637
Okay. Listen to this.

56:04.764 --> 56:07.600
"Do not go gentle
into that good night.

56:07.725 --> 56:11.312
Old age should burn
and rave at close of day.

56:11.479 --> 56:15.441
Rage, rage against
the dying of the light."

56:16.859 --> 56:18.986
Where's the code?
Where's the death?

56:19.112 --> 56:21.781
Night. All that stuff
about night. That's death.

56:23.366 --> 56:25.451
So it's "Don't go gentle
into that good death."

56:25.618 --> 56:29.122
Yeah, but I think "good"
is sarcastic.

56:29.288 --> 56:33.459
When he say, "Do not go gentle,"
that's like sayin', "Don't go easy."

56:33.584 --> 56:37.171
- So it's the same as
"l will not go down."
- We just won us

56:37.296 --> 56:39.715
Shh.

56:39.841 --> 56:42.718
This is the life

56:42.885 --> 56:46.889
Everyone has to be somewhere

56:49.350 --> 56:52.562
Oh

56:52.728 --> 56:57.734
I am here

57:03.156 --> 57:07.243
This is the life

57:07.410 --> 57:11.372
This is the life

57:11.539 --> 57:16.711
- This is my
- Well, the results of the
Dylan-Dylan contest are in.

57:16.878 --> 57:18.838
- Life
- The winners are--

57:18.963 --> 57:22.842
- That's me. Right here.
- Sit down. I am Bob Dylan. Sit down.

57:23.009 --> 57:25.970
- Yo, shh! Shh!
- Sorry, Miss Johnson.

57:26.137 --> 57:28.431
- Shh.
- Shh.

57:30.266 --> 57:33.102
Raul, Durrell and Callie!

57:38.232 --> 57:40.193
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

57:40.318 --> 57:43.446
- Here's your certificate.
- Hey!
- Congratulations.

57:44.655 --> 57:46.532
Congratulations, Callie.

57:46.657 --> 57:49.077
Okay!

57:49.202 --> 57:52.038
But there are no losers in this class.
You guys did great.

57:52.205 --> 57:54.499
You all get to pick a prize
from the box.

57:54.624 --> 57:57.877
How come they get a prize
when they got the wrong answer?

57:58.044 --> 58:01.547
Well, because sometimes
it takes a lot of wrong answers
to get to the right one.

58:01.714 --> 58:04.967
Hey, everyone can't be right,
'cept for us!

58:07.512 --> 58:09.430
Come on up.

58:17.647 --> 58:20.024
- Miss Johnson?
- Hey, Callie.

58:20.149 --> 58:23.861
- Um, I wanted to talk to you
about the restaurant.
- Uh-huh.

58:24.028 --> 58:26.406
- I can't go.
- Why?

58:26.572 --> 58:29.492
Because I have to work at this
supermarket every night until
June and I already told them--

58:29.659 --> 58:31.494
Oh, isn't there any way
to get out of it?

58:31.619 --> 58:35.206
No. Because of the schedule
and everything, I have to do it.

58:35.373 --> 58:39.252
- But thank you anyway.
- Well, o-okay. Well.

58:39.377 --> 58:41.921
Shoot.

58:42.046 --> 58:46.592
Well, no, it's okay. lf you
can't come to dinner, then, uh,
well, we'll bring dinner to you.

58:46.717 --> 58:50.346
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

58:50.513 --> 58:53.349
- Thank you.
- I'm taking orders, Miss Roberts.

59:03.025 --> 59:04.777
I couldn't find
a parking space.

59:04.902 --> 59:06.779
lt's okay.
I just got here myself.

59:06.904 --> 59:09.449
- Oh, you look very handsome.
- How 'bout this jacket?

59:09.574 --> 59:11.451
lt's fantastic.

59:11.576 --> 59:13.578
Go ahead, touch it.
lt's real leather.

59:13.703 --> 59:16.456
- Ooh!
- Hey, where's Callie?

59:16.622 --> 59:18.833
Oh, she had to work.
Where's Durrell?

59:18.958 --> 59:22.545
- Oh, he had to work too.
- Oh.

59:22.670 --> 59:26.299
Well, I guess it's just
you and me, handsome.

59:26.466 --> 59:28.301
I guess so.

59:29.719 --> 59:32.221
Oh. Ladies first.

59:32.388 --> 59:34.223
Thank you.

59:41.397 --> 59:44.066
- Hey, are you sure they got chicken?
- Mm-hmm.

59:48.404 --> 59:51.282
May I tell you a little
about this evening's specials?

59:51.407 --> 59:56.829
The chef is featuring foie gras
with smoked duck and figs
on a hill of bulgar.

59:56.954 --> 01:00:00.416
Uh, salmon tartar
in potato gaufrette...

01:00:00.583 --> 01:00:03.377
over wild mushrooms,
and fennel salad.

01:00:03.544 --> 01:00:05.755
Uh, for the entree
we're featuring...

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:09.675
a complex shellfish
pan roast with orso,

01:00:09.842 --> 01:00:13.638
a touch of comfit and a broth
thickened with lobster shell oil.

01:00:13.763 --> 01:00:16.724
All very, very good.

01:00:19.393 --> 01:00:21.562
- Could we have a few minutes, please?
- Ah, yes.

01:00:21.729 --> 01:00:24.023
Thank you.

01:00:24.148 --> 01:00:26.359
- Are you sure they got chicken?
- Yes.

01:00:26.526 --> 01:00:29.362
Here. See, it's right there,
sweetie. You see? Poulet.

01:00:29.529 --> 01:00:34.784
And when the waiter comes back,
you may as well talk to him.

01:00:34.951 --> 01:00:38.204
lt'll be good practice
for your summer job interviews.

01:00:38.329 --> 01:00:41.040
I can't talk to that guy. He probably
thinks I'm weird or something.

01:00:41.165 --> 01:00:45.545
He does not. He can't help
but notice your natural charm.

01:00:45.711 --> 01:00:49.507
You just look him straight
in the eye and you talk to him
like you would anyone else.

01:00:50.716 --> 01:00:52.427
Now, go ahead and call him over.

01:00:55.304 --> 01:00:59.308
Go ahead. Just give him
a little nod.

01:01:05.022 --> 01:01:08.526
- Are we ready?
- Okay, I'll have the chicken.

01:01:10.653 --> 01:01:12.530
A whole one.

01:01:15.575 --> 01:01:17.952
And I'll have the same.

01:01:18.119 --> 01:01:20.997
And one to go, please.

01:01:21.164 --> 01:01:24.292
One to go. Thank you.

01:01:41.684 --> 01:01:43.311
Hey, Miss J?

01:01:43.436 --> 01:01:48.399
I was wondering maybe, like,
in the next couple of days, if I--

01:01:48.524 --> 01:01:52.070
- ls everything all right?
- Everything's fine. Thank you.

01:01:52.195 --> 01:01:54.280
All right.

01:01:54.405 --> 01:01:56.783
Now don't be mad or nothing,
but I gotta be absent...

01:01:56.908 --> 01:01:59.535
for a couple of days
without your coming to my house.

01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:02.455
lt's important.

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:06.125
- You'll have to tell me why.
- I got some shit to do.

01:02:10.088 --> 01:02:12.131
I gotta make some money
to pay back this guy.

01:02:16.594 --> 01:02:19.263
This doesn't sound important
enough to cut school.

01:02:19.347 --> 01:02:22.183
lt is. I gotta pay
for this jacket.

01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:24.644
See, I got it off the street
from this guy for 200 dollars,

01:02:24.811 --> 01:02:26.646
and he said he'd trust me
for it until Friday.

01:02:26.771 --> 01:02:29.816
Why did you buy it on the street
instead of in a store?

01:02:29.982 --> 01:02:32.902
Are you crazy? You know how much
this would cost in a store?

01:02:33.027 --> 01:02:37.073
I needed a nice jacket and fast,
and I got it from this guy
'cause he cut me a deal...

01:02:37.198 --> 01:02:41.702
'cause he stole it,
probably.

01:02:41.828 --> 01:02:46.541
So, are you gonna go out and get
a job or are you gonna go out
and steal too to pay him back?

01:02:46.707 --> 01:02:49.168
Miss J, I gotta pay him back.

01:02:49.335 --> 01:02:51.504
He'll kill me.

01:02:52.672 --> 01:02:54.632
I didn't have nothing to wear!

01:03:04.058 --> 01:03:07.228
Fine. I'll lend it to you.

01:03:09.439 --> 01:03:11.983
I can't take your money.
Teachers are poor. Everyone knows that.

01:03:13.651 --> 01:03:16.070
Well, you don't really
have a choice, do you?

01:03:16.195 --> 01:03:18.614
lf you don't pay the guy back,
he'll kill you.

01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:22.535
lf you cut school, I'll tell
your father and he'll kill you.

01:03:22.702 --> 01:03:27.290
- So I'm your only way out.
- Oh, man.

01:03:27.457 --> 01:03:30.668
- But I do have one condition.
- Big?

01:03:30.793 --> 01:03:32.837
- Huge.
- What do you want, interest?

01:03:32.962 --> 01:03:36.257
- Mm-mmm. Bigger.
- Jesus Christ, what is it?

01:03:37.467 --> 01:03:40.303
Well.

01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:43.556
- Would you like dessert?
- No!

01:03:43.723 --> 01:03:46.642
- Another glass of wine?
- Oh, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

01:03:46.809 --> 01:03:49.645
- Coffee, perhaps?
- Hey, man, we're talking!

01:03:53.399 --> 01:03:55.985
So, what's the condition?

01:03:58.279 --> 01:04:01.908
You have to pay me back
on the day you graduate.

01:04:04.327 --> 01:04:06.704
But-- But what if
I don't graduate?

01:04:06.829 --> 01:04:10.291
Well, then you'll never
pay me back the money.

01:04:10.416 --> 01:04:13.961
But I know that
if you say you will,

01:04:14.087 --> 01:04:16.798
you'll kill yourself
keeping your word.

01:04:37.527 --> 01:04:40.780
Well, what do you say?

01:04:40.947 --> 01:04:45.118
I don't get it. Why do you
care so much if I graduate?

01:04:45.243 --> 01:04:47.495
Weird, isn't it?

01:04:53.251 --> 01:04:55.294
All right, I'll pay you back.

01:04:59.132 --> 01:05:01.968
- You have my word.
- Hey.

01:05:02.093 --> 01:05:04.804
lt is a very nice jacket.

01:05:07.014 --> 01:05:09.475
Thank you.

01:05:28.995 --> 01:05:30.830
- Hey.
- Oh, hi!
- Hi.

01:05:30.997 --> 01:05:33.332
- How you doin'?
- Oh, good.

01:05:33.499 --> 01:05:36.961
I think this is the first time I ever
brought food into a supermarket.

01:05:37.128 --> 01:05:40.506
-Yeah, I can smell it from here.
-Yeah.
-Good. Thanks.

01:05:40.631 --> 01:05:43.843
Well, Raul says if you don't like it,
he'll take it off your hands.

01:05:44.010 --> 01:05:47.430
Oh, please.
Like hell he will.

01:05:47.597 --> 01:05:50.433
Callie, could you help load
in aisle three, please?

01:05:50.558 --> 01:05:55.480
Be right there. I'm telling you,
this place would fall to pieces
if it wasn't for me.

01:05:55.605 --> 01:05:58.816
You know, Callie,

01:05:58.941 --> 01:06:00.818
just between you and me,

01:06:00.943 --> 01:06:06.199
with your scores, I think you should
consider going into Advanced English.

01:06:06.365 --> 01:06:10.078
- Oh, but I'm gonna be at Clearview.
You didn't know?
- No.

01:06:10.203 --> 01:06:13.748
You didn't see my record?
I tell you.

01:06:13.873 --> 01:06:15.750
No, I-- I didn't know.

01:06:15.917 --> 01:06:18.628
- Bye now.
- Yeah.

01:06:21.005 --> 01:06:23.674
ln the middle of a semester?
Are-- Are you moving?

01:06:23.758 --> 01:06:26.135
No. I'm pregnant.

01:06:26.302 --> 01:06:29.806
And since I'm startin' to show,
they thought it was time, you know?

01:06:32.433 --> 01:06:37.563
- Who thought it was time?
- The school. They don't let you
stay there if you're pregnant.

01:06:37.730 --> 01:06:41.150
But they told me they have this
really good programme at Clearview
for, like, teenage mothers.

01:06:41.317 --> 01:06:45.238
And they teach you stuff like parenting
and nutrition, all kinds of stuff.

01:06:45.363 --> 01:06:47.907
So I thought it would
be good for me, you know?

01:06:48.074 --> 01:06:50.326
- Yeah.
- Aisle three.

01:06:51.953 --> 01:06:55.456
"Degrade first the arts
if you'd mankind degrade."

01:06:55.581 --> 01:06:58.876
Hey, that's the spray can poem.

01:07:02.046 --> 01:07:05.716
-Hey, hey, what's the code word?
-The code word is "great rides
and great prizes."

01:07:05.883 --> 01:07:08.594
I'm keeping it undercover
But comin' soon, I surmises

01:07:10.972 --> 01:07:13.975
Does anybody know where, um,
Durrell and Lionel are today?

01:07:16.018 --> 01:07:19.772
- Durrell and Lionel.
- No.
- They around.

01:07:19.939 --> 01:07:24.110
Yeah, so what's the prize we're
gonna get for learning this poem?

01:07:24.235 --> 01:07:27.864
Learning is the prize.

01:07:27.989 --> 01:07:29.866
Yeah.

01:07:29.991 --> 01:07:33.077
Knowing how to read something
and understand it is the prize.

01:07:33.202 --> 01:07:36.456
Okay? Knowing how to think
is the prize.

01:07:36.622 --> 01:07:39.959
- I know how to think right now.
- Okay. Well, yeah, well,
you know how to run too.

01:07:40.084 --> 01:07:42.420
But not the way you
could run if you trained.

01:07:42.545 --> 01:07:45.423
You know, the mind
is like a muscle.

01:07:45.590 --> 01:07:49.510
Okay? And if you want it to be really
powerful, you got to work it out. Okay?

01:07:49.677 --> 01:07:54.348
Each new fact
gives you another choice.

01:07:54.474 --> 01:07:58.227
Each new idea builds
another muscle, okay?

01:07:58.352 --> 01:08:01.397
And it's those muscles that are
gonna make you really strong.

01:08:01.564 --> 01:08:05.568
Those are your weapons,
and in this unsafe world...

01:08:05.735 --> 01:08:07.945
I want to arm you.

01:08:08.071 --> 01:08:11.824
- And that's what these poems
are supposed to do?
- Yeah.

01:08:11.991 --> 01:08:14.494
Hey, try it. You're just
sittin' here anyway.

01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:17.497
Look. Okay.
lf at the end of the term,

01:08:17.622 --> 01:08:20.707
you're not faster, stronger
and smarter,

01:08:20.875 --> 01:08:23.836
you will have lost nothing.

01:08:24.002 --> 01:08:27.173
But if you are,

01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:32.261
you'll be that much tougher
to knock down.

01:08:32.428 --> 01:08:37.975
So what's "Hire idiots to paint
with cold light and hot shade"?

01:08:39.268 --> 01:08:40.978
They're being sarcastic, Raul.

01:08:41.104 --> 01:08:43.523
I mean, 'cause you know that light
is supposed to be warm, right?

01:08:43.648 --> 01:08:45.774
- And shade is supposed to be what?
- Cold?

01:08:45.942 --> 01:08:49.779
Exactly. But if you go
and hire an idiot to do the job,
he's gonna do it backwards.

01:08:49.904 --> 01:08:52.156
- Hello.
- There you go.
- Hmm.

01:08:53.698 --> 01:08:56.368
Don't make a big fuss
about this, Louanne.

01:08:56.536 --> 01:08:59.747
You have to help me. You have
no idea how bright this girl is.

01:08:59.872 --> 01:09:02.834
Yes, I do. And there's nothing
I can do about it.

01:09:02.959 --> 01:09:06.462
Oh! That just makes me crazy!

01:09:06.587 --> 01:09:10.049
What right do these miserable,
self-righteous sons of bitches
from the Board of Education...

01:09:10.174 --> 01:09:13.261
have to make a moral judgment
on Callie Roberts?

01:09:13.386 --> 01:09:15.470
- Do you know--
- Louanne, there are parents
in the next room.

01:09:15.638 --> 01:09:17.807
Look, I don't c--
I'm gonna fight this ruling.

01:09:17.932 --> 01:09:21.685
I'm gonna write an open letter
to every newspaper condemning
the entire School Board.

01:09:21.853 --> 01:09:24.104
- Oh, you can't do that.
- Why not?

01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:28.109
Well, first of all, the Board
has nothing to do with it.

01:09:30.403 --> 01:09:34.448
We prefer that these girls go to
the mother-to-be programme at Clearview.

01:09:38.243 --> 01:09:40.537
Oh, wait a minute.

01:09:40.705 --> 01:09:44.500
You mean this isn't a rule?
You mean this is your preference?

01:09:46.002 --> 01:09:47.920
Well, yes.

01:09:48.087 --> 01:09:52.216
You mean Callie Roberts is free
to go to any school she wants?

01:09:52.341 --> 01:09:56.846
- lncluding this one?
- Unless she's absent
for more than 30 days.

01:09:57.013 --> 01:09:59.557
And then she has to wait
until the baby's born
before she can come back here.

01:09:59.682 --> 01:10:05.438
But, Louanne, once these girls
have babies, very few of them
come back to school anyway.

01:10:05.563 --> 01:10:08.024
I see.

01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:12.278
So you make them think
they have to leave.

01:10:12.445 --> 01:10:15.656
You just push 'em out a little earlier,
make it a little harder,

01:10:15.782 --> 01:10:17.950
make it a little more hopeless.

01:10:18.076 --> 01:10:20.328
I do what I have to do...

01:10:20.453 --> 01:10:23.456
because it is dangerous to have
a pregnant girl in a classroom.

01:10:23.581 --> 01:10:28.294
lt's not a warning, Louanne. I-lt's
prestige, it's stardom, it's attention.

01:10:28.419 --> 01:10:30.671
You know, not all these girls
become pregnant by accident.

01:10:30.838 --> 01:10:33.966
- Pregnancy is contagious.
- Yep, yep

01:10:34.092 --> 01:10:35.968
- lt's all right
- lt's all right

01:10:36.094 --> 01:10:38.513
As you may have heard

01:10:38.679 --> 01:10:41.474
- Yeah
- To smoke a fat one
- To smoke a fat one

01:10:41.641 --> 01:10:44.143
- And drink a 'Bird
- Drink a Thunderbird

01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:46.479
- lt's okay
- lt's okay

01:10:46.604 --> 01:10:49.482
- To play this loud
- Play it loud

01:10:49.649 --> 01:10:53.569
Mister DJ, don't mean
to sweat you down

01:10:53.736 --> 01:10:55.655
Who is it?

01:10:55.822 --> 01:10:59.075
lt's Louanne Johnson,
Callie's second period teacher.

01:11:03.496 --> 01:11:05.665
Hi.

01:11:05.832 --> 01:11:09.001
Um, Callie's getting ready
to go to work.

01:11:09.127 --> 01:11:10.878
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

01:11:11.045 --> 01:11:13.548
Curiosity killed the cat

01:11:13.714 --> 01:11:15.508
- Oh.
- Hi.
- Hi, there.

01:11:15.633 --> 01:11:18.761
- What you doing?
- Watching TV.

01:11:20.596 --> 01:11:23.724
- What's your name?
- Tyeisha.

01:11:23.850 --> 01:11:27.103
- Oh, that's a pretty name.
- She just love her TV.

01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:30.815
Why ain't you in bed?
Come here, baby.

01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:34.360
Callie? Honey?
Your teacher's here.

01:11:39.198 --> 01:11:42.201
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:11:42.326 --> 01:11:45.705
I'm sorry to just bust in
on you like this, but I have
the most wonderful news...

01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:48.666
and I wanted to come
tell you personally.

01:11:48.791 --> 01:11:51.919
You do not have to go
to Clearview.

01:11:52.044 --> 01:11:57.300
There is nothing in the rules that says
you can't stay exactly where you are.

01:11:57.467 --> 01:11:59.343
But, uh, she already
enrolled in Clearview.

01:11:59.469 --> 01:12:02.597
Uh, well, that's all right. She-- that--
But she doesn't have to go there.

01:12:02.764 --> 01:12:06.309
Yeah, but Kimboley wants me
to take the mother-to-be programme
at Clearview, you know.

01:12:06.434 --> 01:12:09.812
He thought it would be a good
idea if I learned how to take
care of the baby and stuff.

01:12:12.106 --> 01:12:14.984
I don't understand.

01:12:15.109 --> 01:12:18.738
Do you not want to stay
at Parkmont?

01:12:18.863 --> 01:12:22.241
Well, yeah, but I gotta learn how
to take care of us, you know.

01:12:22.366 --> 01:12:24.827
I mean, we're getting our own
place and everything, so--

01:12:28.456 --> 01:12:31.584
Callie, just don't throw away
all you can become.

01:12:33.419 --> 01:12:36.672
Kimboley was so right.
He was so right.

01:12:36.798 --> 01:12:39.592
He told me that you'd probably
try to talk me out of this.

01:12:39.717 --> 01:12:41.636
You want to know
what else he said?

01:12:41.761 --> 01:12:44.388
He said that you probably
don't even like men...

01:12:44.555 --> 01:12:47.225
and that you're probably not married
and you don't want anybody else to be.

01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:50.436
That's why you're always
in everybody else's life.

01:12:54.315 --> 01:12:57.860
Look, I'm not saying
that I agree with him, okay?

01:12:58.027 --> 01:13:00.905
Well, Kimboley's wrong.

01:13:01.072 --> 01:13:03.449
I was married...

01:13:03.616 --> 01:13:05.451
and I was pregnant.

01:13:08.079 --> 01:13:10.665
So what happened?

01:13:12.625 --> 01:13:15.253
We got divorced...

01:13:15.378 --> 01:13:18.464
and I had an abortion.

01:13:22.135 --> 01:13:24.137
He beat me.

01:13:26.931 --> 01:13:30.268
Well, sometimes
you start out wrong...

01:13:30.435 --> 01:13:33.479
and just keep going.

01:13:47.535 --> 01:13:50.079
Hey, don't touch me.
Oh, get outta here!

01:13:51.831 --> 01:13:54.876
I'll see you.

01:13:55.001 --> 01:13:57.587
You took something that
fuckin' belonged to me, ése.

01:13:57.754 --> 01:14:00.715
Man, she came to me
with open arms.

01:14:00.882 --> 01:14:03.259
Besides, you gotta have
one of these.

01:14:05.344 --> 01:14:07.221
You're dead.

01:14:19.776 --> 01:14:22.612
As I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death

01:14:22.779 --> 01:14:25.948
I take a look at my life
and realize there's nothing left

01:14:26.074 --> 01:14:28.618
'Cause I've been blastin'
and laughin' so long

01:14:28.785 --> 01:14:31.913
That even my mama thinks
that my mind is gone

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:34.707
I really hate to trip
but I gotta loc

01:14:34.832 --> 01:14:37.293
As they croak I see myself
in the pistol smoke

01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:41.172
Fool, I'm the kind of "G"
the little homies wanna be like

01:14:41.339 --> 01:14:44.383
On my knees in the night
sayin' prayers in the street light

01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:49.889
Been spendin' most their lives
livin' in a gangsta's paradise

01:14:50.014 --> 01:14:52.058
- Hey, Miss Johnson.
- Hey!
- Been spendin' most their lives

01:14:52.183 --> 01:14:55.645
- Haven't seen you guys in a week.
- Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

01:14:55.812 --> 01:14:58.397
Thought maybe you got lost
on your way to class.

01:14:58.523 --> 01:15:00.608
I wanted to help you
find your way back.

01:15:00.733 --> 01:15:03.444
Get on inside.

01:15:03.569 --> 01:15:06.406
Clean up that pigsty of a room.

01:15:11.702 --> 01:15:14.580
Hi. I'm Louanne Johnson.
I'm the boys' teacher.

01:15:14.747 --> 01:15:16.582
I know who you are.

01:15:16.749 --> 01:15:20.294
You're that white-bread bitch
messin' with my babies' minds.

01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:22.296
I beg your pardon?

01:15:22.422 --> 01:15:25.550
My boys don't go to your school
no more, and that's gonna be it.

01:15:27.343 --> 01:15:29.804
- You took 'em out of school?
- You're damn right I did.

01:15:29.929 --> 01:15:33.766
I saw what they were bringing
home-- poetry and shit.

01:15:33.891 --> 01:15:38.688
A waste of time. They got
more important things to worry about.

01:15:41.274 --> 01:15:45.153
Don't you think that finishing high
school will be valuable to their future?

01:15:45.278 --> 01:15:47.280
That's not in their future.

01:15:47.405 --> 01:15:51.284
I ain't raising no doctors and lawyers
here. They got bills to pay.

01:15:51.451 --> 01:15:53.578
Why don't you just
get on outta here.

01:15:53.703 --> 01:15:57.707
Go find yourself some other
poor boys to save.

01:16:11.304 --> 01:16:14.140
Mama! I could stand
some lemonade.

01:16:20.229 --> 01:16:24.275
"lt is easier
to forgive an enemy...

01:16:24.442 --> 01:16:27.028
than to forgive a friend.

01:16:27.153 --> 01:16:31.115
The man who permits you
to injure him...

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:33.993
deserves your vengeance.

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:37.538
He also will receive it."

01:16:37.663 --> 01:16:40.458
Wow, who wrote that?
Some Mafia guy?

01:16:40.583 --> 01:16:42.460
You know, let's go on
with this poem tomorrow.

01:16:42.627 --> 01:16:44.879
Why don't you-- Take out your work
sheets and do the vocabulary drill.

01:16:45.004 --> 01:16:48.382
- Say what?
- Oh, man!
- Man, I don't wanna do no vocabulary.

01:16:48.549 --> 01:16:50.718
I don't wanna do
no damn vocabulary.

01:16:50.885 --> 01:16:53.054
Then don't.

01:16:53.179 --> 01:16:56.641
What do you mean?
You mean I have a choice?

01:16:56.808 --> 01:17:00.561
You're not gonna let me get away with
not learnin' my vocabulary, right?

01:17:04.023 --> 01:17:07.443
That's right. You have to do
your vocabulary.

01:17:07.610 --> 01:17:10.279
Words are thoughts
and we can't think without 'em.

01:17:10.405 --> 01:17:13.825
So-- Please?

01:17:13.950 --> 01:17:17.620
And so let's just do it, man. She's
gonna be down our back in a minute.

01:17:17.787 --> 01:17:21.124
- Whatever. She's grouchy.
- Grouch.

01:17:21.249 --> 01:17:23.960
- Thanks, Louanne.
- Grouch, grouch.

01:17:24.127 --> 01:17:27.296
Thank you, Louanne.
Such a nice lady, Louanne.

01:17:29.674 --> 01:17:32.885
What do I do?
What the fuck you want from me?

01:17:33.010 --> 01:17:35.805
Who, my teacher? You think
I'm gonna fuckin' talk to a teacher?

01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:38.433
Like they're gonna
really help me, huh? Huh?

01:17:38.599 --> 01:17:41.686
Teachers aren't gonna
fuckin' help me, okay?

01:17:41.853 --> 01:17:45.731
Miss Johnson! Miss Johnson,
we gotta talk to you.

01:17:45.898 --> 01:17:48.860
- There's nothing to talk about, Angela!
- What, are you Superman?

01:17:49.026 --> 01:17:52.029
ls your ass bulletproof?
ls that what you think? Tell her!

01:17:52.196 --> 01:17:54.824
- Tell her what you're gonna do.
- What is it?

01:17:54.949 --> 01:17:57.869
- He's strapped.
- Shut the fuck up!
She don't need to know my business.

01:17:57.994 --> 01:18:00.872
ls your business dying? No!

01:18:00.997 --> 01:18:03.916
There's this crackhead named Shorty.
He just came out of jail.

01:18:04.041 --> 01:18:06.502
He says that I'm his girl and
that Emilio took me from him.

01:18:06.669 --> 01:18:09.088
And now he wants to kill Emilio.

01:18:11.090 --> 01:18:14.302
Emilio, if this boy is threatening you,
we can go to the police.

01:18:14.427 --> 01:18:16.721
Look, this is nothing you
can do anything about.

01:18:16.846 --> 01:18:19.599
This guy is looking for me to kill me,
and the only way for me to stop him...

01:18:19.724 --> 01:18:22.226
is for me to kill him first.

01:18:22.393 --> 01:18:24.687
That's just the way it is,
all right?

01:18:24.812 --> 01:18:28.191
Wait, Emilio, wait, wait, wait, wait,
no! Can we-- Can we talk about this?

01:18:28.316 --> 01:18:31.027
- Come to my house.
- Yeah, right.

01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:33.321
Oh, what?
You're too proud to hide?

01:18:33.446 --> 01:18:36.657
lt's better to wander
the streets all night?

01:18:36.824 --> 01:18:39.786
- Come on.
- Please?

01:18:39.952 --> 01:18:41.788
Please, just go.

01:18:45.458 --> 01:18:48.461
Go. Go.

01:18:50.421 --> 01:18:52.882
- Can we drop you?
- Just go.

01:19:09.065 --> 01:19:11.651
ls this boy your age?

01:19:14.737 --> 01:19:18.074
- Yeah.
- Does he go to Parkmont?

01:19:18.199 --> 01:19:21.077
I won't tell you who it is.

01:19:21.202 --> 01:19:23.079
No, don't.

01:19:25.289 --> 01:19:28.251
But if you tell Mr Grandey
about him--

01:19:28.418 --> 01:19:33.756
not about his threatening you,
but about his being on crack--

01:19:33.881 --> 01:19:38.386
he'll be turned over to the juvenile
court for-- for drug abuse in school.

01:19:38.553 --> 01:19:40.888
H-He won't serve hard time,

01:19:41.013 --> 01:19:45.268
but by the time he gets out and
he's detoxed, he-- he will have
gotten over trying to kill you.

01:19:52.483 --> 01:19:54.360
No, I can't rat on him.

01:19:54.485 --> 01:19:57.488
Right. Kill him.
That's better.

01:19:59.031 --> 01:20:01.617
Man,

01:20:01.784 --> 01:20:03.619
you don't understand.

01:20:06.998 --> 01:20:11.794
You asked me once how I was
gonna save you from your life.

01:20:11.961 --> 01:20:14.547
This is how. This moment.

01:20:16.215 --> 01:20:18.968
Right now.

01:20:19.135 --> 01:20:21.512
This will make the difference
in your life forever.

01:20:52.001 --> 01:20:53.878
Emilio?

01:21:01.135 --> 01:21:02.970
Emilio?

01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:19.695
- Oh, Mr Grandey.
- ls there a problem, Miss Johnson?

01:21:19.862 --> 01:21:21.864
- Shouldn't you be in class?
- Yes, I'm late.

01:21:22.031 --> 01:21:26.744
Um, I just wanted to ask.
Did Emilio Ramirez come
to your office this morning?

01:21:26.911 --> 01:21:29.455
- Yes.
- Oh, God. Oh, thank God.

01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:32.583
- Did you talk to him?
- No, I sent him away.

01:21:32.708 --> 01:21:34.794
You-- What do you mean?

01:21:36.879 --> 01:21:40.758
- I mean I sent him away.
- Why?

01:21:40.883 --> 01:21:43.469
Because he didn't knock,
Miss Johnson.

01:21:43.636 --> 01:21:47.682
- Here we are.
- Because he didn't knock?

01:21:47.849 --> 01:21:52.103
Yes, Miss Johnson. I'm trying to teach
these children how to live in the world.

01:21:52.270 --> 01:21:55.481
And in the world, you just don't
burst into someone's office.

01:21:58.359 --> 01:22:01.195
Because he didn't knock?

01:22:04.323 --> 01:22:06.534
Damn it!

01:22:39.233 --> 01:22:41.110
Uh, Louanne.

01:22:42.570 --> 01:22:45.573
Mr Grandey is with the police.

01:22:45.698 --> 01:22:47.909
- Yes?
- Um.

01:22:48.034 --> 01:22:51.621
They just found Emilio Ramirez
three blocks from the school.

01:22:51.746 --> 01:22:54.457
He was shot this morning.

01:22:56.793 --> 01:22:58.628
ls he dead?

01:23:01.672 --> 01:23:05.259
- He's dead.
- I'm very sorry.

01:23:07.053 --> 01:23:09.263
Um...

01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:11.474
are you going to tell them now?

01:23:14.018 --> 01:23:16.395
Do you think that's wise?

01:23:19.398 --> 01:23:21.484
Yeah.

01:23:21.651 --> 01:23:25.196
Well, uh, perhaps if you talk to them
a little bit about death...

01:23:25.321 --> 01:23:28.491
and-- and-- and what it means.

01:23:29.742 --> 01:23:32.161
What would you like me to say?

01:23:32.328 --> 01:23:35.164
That if you don't want to die,
remember to knock?

01:23:36.624 --> 01:23:39.252
- That's not fair.
- What is?

01:23:56.602 --> 01:23:58.896
Bad news.

01:24:00.356 --> 01:24:03.443
Emilio was shot this morning.

01:24:05.278 --> 01:24:07.822
ls he dead?

01:24:07.947 --> 01:24:11.868
- Yes, baby, he's dead.
- Oh, no.

01:24:59.373 --> 01:25:04.378
Yo! Listen up. Miss Johnson
got something to say!

01:25:04.504 --> 01:25:07.965
- Shh.
- Thank you.

01:25:08.132 --> 01:25:11.469
I just want to say...

01:25:11.594 --> 01:25:14.722
l, uh-- I won't, um--

01:25:17.058 --> 01:25:20.144
I will not be here next year.

01:25:20.269 --> 01:25:22.146
I'm not coming back.

01:25:23.773 --> 01:25:26.067
How come?
ls it something we did?

01:25:26.192 --> 01:25:28.945
No. No, no, no. No. Um--

01:25:32.031 --> 01:25:34.200
I-l never intended to stay.

01:25:34.367 --> 01:25:37.036
Um, this was an unexpected job.

01:25:37.203 --> 01:25:41.124
So if you knew you wasn't
gonna stay, how come you made me
promise what I promised?

01:25:42.708 --> 01:25:44.544
I--

01:25:46.587 --> 01:25:49.632
At that time,
I thought I would stay.

01:25:49.799 --> 01:25:51.843
So how come you're leaving?

01:25:53.928 --> 01:25:55.763
I just...

01:25:57.181 --> 01:25:59.642
have my reasons,
certain reasons.

01:25:59.767 --> 01:26:03.896
ls it because it's too sad for you,
what happened to Emilio?

01:26:18.161 --> 01:26:20.121
Maybe.

01:26:20.288 --> 01:26:22.874
And Durrell and Lionel
and Callie. And I just--

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:24.876
I just think that--

01:26:29.714 --> 01:26:33.050
So if you love us so much and you're
so interested in our graduating,

01:26:33.176 --> 01:26:36.220
- how come you choose to leave?
- Yeah.

01:26:36.345 --> 01:26:41.184
You sad about Durrell and Callie
and Emilio and Lionel, but we're here.

01:26:41.309 --> 01:26:44.937
What about us, huh?
None of us make you feel happy?

01:26:45.104 --> 01:26:49.692
We been working hard and we stayed
in school, man. What about us?

01:26:49.817 --> 01:26:52.028
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:27:07.210 --> 01:27:10.463
Why are you packing up today
when tomorrow is your last day?

01:27:11.672 --> 01:27:13.549
Oh, just gettin' a head start.

01:27:15.093 --> 01:27:16.969
Oh, I see.

01:27:21.057 --> 01:27:25.561
What you did, when you
gave me the 200 dollars?

01:27:28.272 --> 01:27:33.569
That was the nicest thing
anybody ever did for me.

01:27:33.694 --> 01:27:36.155
I don't know anybody else
who would give 200 dollars...

01:27:36.322 --> 01:27:38.908
to a Mexican kid
on his word of honour.

01:27:44.872 --> 01:27:47.333
S-So you gotta let me
pay you back.

01:27:51.045 --> 01:27:54.173
Even if I don't graduate,
all right?

01:27:54.298 --> 01:27:57.009
Why wouldn't you graduate?

01:27:58.719 --> 01:28:01.681
Ain't no other teacher
gonna give me no "A."

01:28:01.806 --> 01:28:04.517
Yes, they will, if you work for them
the way you worked for me.

01:28:04.642 --> 01:28:07.186
No, but it was different with you.
You gave me an "A" to start with.

01:28:07.353 --> 01:28:11.732
- I didn't have to earn it.
I just had to keep it.
- Are you kidding?

01:28:11.858 --> 01:28:16.404
Keeping an "A" is harder than getting an
"A." Almost anyone can get an "A" once.

01:28:16.571 --> 01:28:19.657
But keeping it,
that's an accomplishment.

01:28:19.824 --> 01:28:22.702
- You think so?
- Oh, I know so.

01:28:22.869 --> 01:28:25.496
Do you realize the work
you did this term?

01:28:25.621 --> 01:28:29.208
Do you realize that
the poetry that we read...

01:28:29.375 --> 01:28:31.335
is given to people in college?

01:28:31.502 --> 01:28:33.671
- ln college.
- These same poems?

01:28:33.796 --> 01:28:37.133
- Yes.
- But they weren't even so hard.

01:28:37.258 --> 01:28:39.177
So, you see?

01:28:41.345 --> 01:28:43.723
Keep working.

01:28:43.890 --> 01:28:46.225
You'll graduate.

01:28:49.020 --> 01:28:51.814
I might even see you
in college.

01:28:51.939 --> 01:28:53.816
What do you think?

01:29:10.792 --> 01:29:14.128
I feel so bad about leaving
I can hardly breathe.

01:29:14.295 --> 01:29:18.382
I know, but-- Oh, what the hell.
You're right.

01:29:18.549 --> 01:29:23.096
You gotta be crazy to stay here
and teach these programme classes.

01:29:23.221 --> 01:29:25.848
There's no money.
lt's killer work.

01:29:28.309 --> 01:29:30.645
Why do you stay?

01:29:30.812 --> 01:29:33.272
Why do I smoke?
I'm crazy.

01:29:33.397 --> 01:29:35.358
You need any more help?

01:29:35.483 --> 01:29:37.777
No. Thanks.
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:29:37.944 --> 01:29:39.779
Yeah. Bye.

01:29:41.656 --> 01:29:44.700
This is the life

01:29:44.826 --> 01:29:48.746
Everyone has to be somewhere

01:29:51.165 --> 01:29:53.876
Oh

01:29:54.043 --> 01:29:59.882
I am here

01:30:02.593 --> 01:30:06.764
This is the life

01:30:06.889 --> 01:30:09.600
This is the life

01:30:10.977 --> 01:30:15.189
'Cause this is my life

01:30:15.314 --> 01:30:20.737
This is my life

01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:24.157
Hi.

01:30:26.993 --> 01:30:31.122
Well. Welcome back.

01:30:31.289 --> 01:30:35.084
This is the 29th day,
the last day I have to come back.

01:30:35.251 --> 01:30:38.379
So, am I still okay
for next term?

01:30:39.630 --> 01:30:41.466
Yeah.

01:30:43.384 --> 01:30:45.762
Did, uh,

01:30:45.928 --> 01:30:49.849
did you come back because
it was your last day or did somebody...

01:30:50.016 --> 01:30:53.269
ask you to come today
to talk me into staying?

01:30:53.436 --> 01:30:56.189
Well, it was both, really.

01:30:56.355 --> 01:31:00.777
See, 'cause I wasn't really sure
what I wanted to do...

01:31:00.902 --> 01:31:03.821
until I heard that you
were leaving and--

01:31:03.946 --> 01:31:06.532
'Cause up until then,
I don't know, I thought...

01:31:06.699 --> 01:31:10.078
that you'd always be here
for me, you know.

01:31:10.203 --> 01:31:12.371
You know, whenever I came back.

01:31:13.956 --> 01:31:16.459
But then Raul tells me
that you're leaving...

01:31:16.584 --> 01:31:18.461
just like that.

01:31:22.090 --> 01:31:24.425
And I realized that this
was my last chance.

01:31:26.594 --> 01:31:28.596
And I decided--

01:31:29.889 --> 01:31:32.975
We decided that...

01:31:33.101 --> 01:31:35.394
we're not gonna just
let you leave like that.

01:31:38.272 --> 01:31:40.817
Yeah, we realized
like the poem said:

01:31:40.983 --> 01:31:43.736
You can't give in.

01:31:43.861 --> 01:31:46.072
"You can't go gentle.

01:31:46.239 --> 01:31:50.326
- You got to rage against
the dying of the light."
- Yeah.

01:31:50.493 --> 01:31:52.703
Yeah, you gotta go for yours.
You know that, right?

01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:55.915
- Yeah.
- You gotta kick it in and get it up.

01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:59.335
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
No, no. Wait, wait. I'm not giving in.

01:31:59.460 --> 01:32:03.047
Um, this is my choice.

01:32:03.214 --> 01:32:06.467
I have no reason to "rage
against the dying of the light."

01:32:06.592 --> 01:32:09.595
'Cause you're not the one who's raging.
We're the ones who are raging.

01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:12.014
See, 'cause we see you
as being our light.

01:32:14.225 --> 01:32:18.104
- What?
- You're our Tambourine Man.

01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:23.109
- Oh, I'm your drug dealer?
- You got the stuff, Miss J?

01:32:23.234 --> 01:32:27.280
You're our teacher. You got
what we need. lt's the same thing.

01:32:27.405 --> 01:32:31.242
Come on, Miss J. All the poems
you taught us say you can't give in.

01:32:31.409 --> 01:32:33.661
You can't give up.

01:32:33.786 --> 01:32:36.664
- Well, we ain't giving you up.
- No way.

01:32:36.789 --> 01:32:41.210
Now, listen, baby, we gonna have to
tie you down to the chair and gag you...

01:32:41.335 --> 01:32:46.340
'cause you know
we want you to stay.

01:32:46.466 --> 01:32:51.179
What you need to stay, girl?
You want a candy bar?

01:32:51.304 --> 01:32:55.808
Okay, on the left and on the right,
a "Louanne, Louanne." Uh, here we go.

01:32:55.933 --> 01:32:59.312
Louanne, Louanne,
Louanne, Louanne.

01:32:59.479 --> 01:33:02.899
- Louanne, Louanne, Louanne, Louanne.
- Come on!

01:33:03.024 --> 01:33:07.612
Louanne, Louanne,
Louanne, Louanne.

01:33:12.825 --> 01:33:17.080
- You have to go first.
- I don't want to go first.
- Come on. You have to.

01:33:17.246 --> 01:33:19.082
Ready? You go like this. Go.

01:33:21.584 --> 01:33:23.795
- lt go like this.
- This how you do it.

01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:27.882
Go, Louanne. Go, Louanne.
Go, Louanne. Go, Louanne.

01:33:28.007 --> 01:33:31.135
Go, Louanne. Go, Louanne.
Go, Louanne.

01:33:37.767 --> 01:33:40.520
Let me see.

01:33:40.645 --> 01:33:43.606
- Excuse me.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:33:46.359 --> 01:33:49.195
- You want to sign my book?
- Yeah, I'll sign your book.

01:34:13.845 --> 01:34:16.556
How'd they get you
to come back?

01:34:16.722 --> 01:34:20.309
They gave me candy
and called me "the light."

01:34:20.476 --> 01:34:22.311
That'll do it.

01:34:51.382 --> 01:34:53.801
I won't do you wrong

01:34:53.968 --> 01:34:56.262
I'll do you right

01:34:56.429 --> 01:35:01.309
You can roll with me
for the rest of the night

01:35:01.476 --> 01:35:05.772
No need to fuss
'cause I don't wanna joke

01:35:05.897 --> 01:35:09.901
Baby, sit right here
and let the chronic smoke

01:35:10.026 --> 01:35:12.945
So hang around, love

01:35:13.112 --> 01:35:15.907
And give it up

01:35:16.074 --> 01:35:20.369
'Cause all the real "G"s
know what I'm thinkin' of

01:35:20.495 --> 01:35:26.084
'Cause you wanna be down, down
so give it up

01:35:26.250 --> 01:35:30.213
There's a party over here
So, baby, show your love

01:35:30.379 --> 01:35:34.550
'Cause I got the gin and juice
Yeah

01:35:34.717 --> 01:35:37.804
- You know that, you know that
- I got the gin and juice

01:35:37.970 --> 01:35:40.598
Yeah

01:35:40.765 --> 01:35:44.977
'Cause I got the gin and juice
Yeah

01:35:47.355 --> 01:35:49.982
- I got the, I got the gin and juice
- Yeah

01:35:50.149 --> 01:35:53.986
- I got the answer
- 'Cause I got the gin and juice

01:36:03.329 --> 01:36:06.082
As I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death

01:36:06.249 --> 01:36:09.502
I take a look at my life
and realize there's nothing left

01:36:09.627 --> 01:36:12.171
'Cause I've been blastin'
and laughin' so long

01:36:12.338 --> 01:36:15.550
That even my mama thinks
that my mind is gone

01:36:15.675 --> 01:36:18.386
I really hate to trip
but I gotta loc

01:36:18.511 --> 01:36:22.098
As they croak I see myself
in the pistol smoke

01:36:22.223 --> 01:36:24.308
Fool, I'm the kind of "G"
the little homies wanna be like

01:36:24.434 --> 01:36:28.020
On my knees in the night
Sayin' prayers in the street light

01:36:28.187 --> 01:36:33.985
Been spending most their lives
livin' in a gangsta's paradise

01:36:34.152 --> 01:36:39.866
Been spending most their lives
livin' in a gangsta's paradise

01:36:39.991 --> 01:36:46.205
We keep spending most our lives
livin' in a gangsta's paradise

01:36:57.300 --> 01:36:59.802
You spent so many nights
in heat

01:36:59.927 --> 01:37:02.555
- And out of control
- Like that

01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:05.183
Waiting impatiently to see

01:37:05.349 --> 01:37:07.852
- What's under my clothes
- Like that

01:37:07.977 --> 01:37:13.107
I just wanna take time
to get right into the point

01:37:13.232 --> 01:37:15.151
Now you got your choice, girl

01:37:15.276 --> 01:37:18.279
- To come and rock this funky joint
- Like that

01:37:18.404 --> 01:37:23.993
Don't you take too long, baby

01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:29.123
I'll be waitin' here
for you, baby, baby

01:37:29.290 --> 01:37:34.253
Here's a gift
to you from me

01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:38.925
Just you wait and see
lt's the curiosity

01:37:39.092 --> 01:37:44.764
- lt's the curiosity
- Curiosity

01:37:44.931 --> 01:37:47.934
- Do you wanna feel my body
- Like that

01:37:48.101 --> 01:37:49.936
Girl, all night long, yeah

01:37:50.103 --> 01:37:52.855
lt's the curiosity

01:37:55.900 --> 01:37:59.612
- Why not now
- Oh, yeah

01:37:59.779 --> 01:38:02.865
- Oh, yeah
- lt's the curiosity

01:38:03.032 --> 01:38:05.034
For you, for me

01:38:05.159 --> 01:38:07.745
lt's the curiosity
