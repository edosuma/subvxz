NARRATOR: Previously on
Once Upon A Time...

00:03.754 --> 00:05.290
-Who are you?
-Peter Pan.

00:05.381 --> 00:07.918
This Tinker Bell is not going to save us.

00:08.009 --> 00:09.749
-You know where Pan is?
-Sure.

00:09.844 --> 00:11.129
The arrow barely nicked me.

00:11.220 --> 00:12.300
Do you know how long?

00:12.388 --> 00:14.003
Days. Weeks at most.

00:14.098 --> 00:15.133
I don't belong here.

00:15.224 --> 00:17.840
You were created for a reason.
And I can help you find it.

00:18.394 --> 00:19.600
(WHOOSHES)

00:20.062 --> 00:21.927
PapalNo!

00:22.023 --> 00:23.638
You're not coming back, are you?

00:23.733 --> 00:25.598
I must do this to honor Baelfire.

00:25.693 --> 00:26.853
I know how to get to Neverland.

00:26.944 --> 00:29.936
Welcome home, Baelfire.

00:37.330 --> 00:39.036
FELIX: Feels like just yesterday

00:39.123 --> 00:41.705
l welcomed you to Neverland
the first time, Baelfire.

00:43.836 --> 00:45.337
I got to say,

00:45.421 --> 00:47.787
hoped I'd never see you again.

00:47.882 --> 00:49.964
Then maybe Pan shouldn't have
taken my son.

00:50.051 --> 00:52.918
Maybe you should've left
well enough alone.

00:54.138 --> 00:55.548
I'm gonna get him back.

00:55.640 --> 00:57.551
You really believe that?

00:57.642 --> 00:59.473
You were a Lost Boy.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.051
You know Peter Pan
is not to be trifled with.

01:02.480 --> 01:04.436
You know how long he's been searching

01:04.523 --> 01:06.650
for the heart of the truest believer.

01:07.318 --> 01:11.061
Do you really believe
he'll just give him up?

01:12.156 --> 01:14.772
-Maybe if I ask nicely.
-(SCOFFS)

01:15.701 --> 01:17.657
You may have grown up, Baelfire.

01:17.745 --> 01:20.327
But it would appear
you've grown up stupid.

01:20.873 --> 01:22.158
l have grown up.

01:22.250 --> 01:23.831
I don't know if I'm stupid or not,

01:23.918 --> 01:25.954
but I do know I know
how to tie an overhand knot.

01:30.341 --> 01:32.582
I'm not a boy anymore, Felix.

01:32.677 --> 01:34.713
I sure as hell ain't lost.

01:51.779 --> 01:52.768
RUMPLESTILTSKIN: Bae?

01:56.033 --> 01:57.318
A present.

01:57.410 --> 01:59.241
Something to sharpen your coal with.

02:02.540 --> 02:03.620
Where did you get it?

02:03.708 --> 02:05.539
From a man who no longer needed it.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.787
You mean taken from a man
who couldn't pay you.

02:07.878 --> 02:10.164
-Bae...
-Papa, I told you.

02:10.256 --> 02:12.713
I don't want any more gifts
from the people you terrorize.

02:14.885 --> 02:16.045
Then what do you want?

02:16.762 --> 02:17.922
Tell me, son,

02:18.347 --> 02:19.883
what will make you happy?

02:20.725 --> 02:21.885
Leaving this place.

02:21.976 --> 02:24.683
I'm tired of staying in this hovel
all the time.

02:25.730 --> 02:26.970
Well, that's easy to fix!

02:27.648 --> 02:29.263
How about a castle, huh?

02:29.358 --> 02:31.974
I could build you
a palace so magnificent

02:32.069 --> 02:34.446
its shadow will blanket the countryside.

02:34.530 --> 02:36.316
That's not what I mean.

02:36.949 --> 02:39.235
I want to go out. Have friends.

02:39.327 --> 02:41.318
See the world beyond these four walls.

02:41.412 --> 02:43.323
Papa, why can't you just trust me
to do that?

02:43.414 --> 02:45.075
I do trust you, Bae.

02:45.166 --> 02:47.077
lt's others that I can't.

02:48.836 --> 02:51.543
You see, I have many enemies
beyond that door.

02:51.630 --> 02:55.293
Once you leave,
any one of them could hurt you.

02:55.384 --> 02:56.885
Are you sure that's the only reason?

02:56.969 --> 03:00.052
Maybe what you're really
worried about is,

03:00.139 --> 03:01.720
ifl leave, I might never come back.

03:03.142 --> 03:04.348
No,no,no.

03:05.019 --> 03:06.384
I'm worried about your safety.

03:07.146 --> 03:09.307
This is the best place for you.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.315
I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you.

03:34.507 --> 03:37.590
BELLE: You've always felt
more comfortable behind a mask.

03:39.011 --> 03:42.629
You were the only one
who could ever see past it.

03:43.808 --> 03:46.470
Past the mask of the monster.

03:47.603 --> 03:50.094
Then why put it back on now?

03:50.189 --> 03:52.054
I need the monster, Belle.

03:52.817 --> 03:54.603
It's the only way I can save him.

03:54.693 --> 03:56.854
And that's what I've decided.
I'm going to save Henry.

03:56.987 --> 04:00.775
The prophecy states
that Henry will be your undoing.

04:01.659 --> 04:04.275
To save him will ensure your own death.

04:05.121 --> 04:07.157
You don't think I can do it?

04:07.665 --> 04:09.781
I think your intentions are good.

04:10.167 --> 04:14.376
But a lifetime of craven self-interest
is a nasty habit

04:14.839 --> 04:17.501
that you've never been able to break.

04:18.342 --> 04:19.673
Things are different now.

04:21.011 --> 04:23.548
How? What's different?

04:26.183 --> 04:28.299
Because I have nothing to live for.

04:31.063 --> 04:33.019
What about me?

04:34.400 --> 04:35.981
You're not real.

04:37.027 --> 04:39.063
Just a vision.

04:40.197 --> 04:42.859
But I'm back in Storybrooke,
waiting for you.

04:43.534 --> 04:45.445
You shouldn't be.

04:45.536 --> 04:47.868
When I said goodbye to you, Belle,

04:47.997 --> 04:50.238
we both knew it was for good.

04:50.875 --> 04:53.161
Maybe I think you'll come back.

04:53.252 --> 04:55.743
Even if I did, eventually, you'd leave me

04:55.880 --> 04:58.872
because you can see me
for what I really am.

04:59.008 --> 05:00.714
You think you see a good man.

05:00.843 --> 05:03.755
But in time, you'd see the monster.

05:04.555 --> 05:06.386
My son is dead.

05:06.515 --> 05:10.349
The only way I can redeem myself
is by saving his son

05:11.103 --> 05:12.889
and giving my life.

05:14.773 --> 05:17.264
This is where they're keeping Henry.
Pan's compound.

05:17.401 --> 05:19.357
-According to...
-Tinker Bell.

05:19.445 --> 05:21.436
Yeah. I know. Still weird to say.

05:21.572 --> 05:22.561
Tink is fine.

05:22.698 --> 05:23.983
Not sure that's any better.

05:24.074 --> 05:28.568
Anyway, she says there are sentries
positioned across the front,

05:28.704 --> 05:31.411
which is why we're gonna come in
through the back entrance, here.

05:31.499 --> 05:33.080
She's gonna talk her way in,

05:33.209 --> 05:36.747
once she makes sure the coast is clear,
then we're going to sneak on in.

05:36.879 --> 05:39.245
You'll still have to deal with
any Lost Boys once you're inside.

05:39.381 --> 05:42.418
I think we can handle a few children
with pointy sticks.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.421
It's not the sticks you need
to worry about.

05:45.095 --> 05:47.427
It's the poison they're dipped in.

05:47.556 --> 05:48.841
Dreamshade. Hook warned us.

05:48.933 --> 05:49.922
Good.

05:50.059 --> 05:52.015
Because one nick and you'll spend
the last of your days...

05:52.102 --> 05:53.842
Poison sticks equal death. We got it.

05:53.938 --> 05:56.350
Now, when can we put this
rescue mission into action?

05:56.440 --> 05:57.771
I'm ready to go.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.850
Just as soon as you tell me
the exit plan.

06:04.406 --> 06:06.613
You do have an escape plan, don't you?

06:07.243 --> 06:09.609
It was more of a last-minute trip.

06:10.913 --> 06:13.279
If you don't have a way off this island,
then none of this matters.

06:13.415 --> 06:14.541
We'll figure it out.

06:14.625 --> 06:15.705
You'll figure it out?

06:16.627 --> 06:19.790
No one comes and goes from this place
unless he allows it.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.461
This is a waste of time.

06:21.590 --> 06:23.296
When it comes to family,
we always find a way.

06:23.384 --> 06:25.124
You don't get it.

06:25.261 --> 06:27.217
Here, let me show you something.

06:27.304 --> 06:28.464
You know what this is?

06:28.556 --> 06:29.545
Yeah, a watch.

06:29.640 --> 06:31.471
I got it from the people
who brought your son here for Pan.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.390
Greg and Tamara? Where are they?
Why did they give you that?

06:33.477 --> 06:35.138
I got it off the girl's body.

06:35.938 --> 06:37.974
Spent half the night cleaning
the blood off it.

06:38.107 --> 06:39.722
And the other guy?

06:39.817 --> 06:42.149
Well, there wasn't enough of him left
to find anything useful.

06:43.988 --> 06:46.149
This is what Pan does
to people he employs.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.901
What do you think
he's gonna do to you?

06:47.992 --> 06:49.732
I'm not sticking my neck
on Pan's chopping block

06:49.827 --> 06:51.317
without a way off this island.

06:51.453 --> 06:53.910
You figure that out,
you know where | live.

06:53.998 --> 06:56.080
-Where the hell is she going?
-l'l| get her, bring her back.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.077
Don't. She's right.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.248
If there's one thing I've learned,

06:59.336 --> 07:01.497
you never break in somewhere
unless you know the way out.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.746
And where did you get that,
in bail bondsperson school?

07:03.841 --> 07:05.923
Neal taught me that.

07:07.344 --> 07:10.256
What about you, Hook?
You got off this island before.

07:10.973 --> 07:12.929
Yes, aboard my ship.

07:13.684 --> 07:17.848
Which would require some form
of magic to create a portal.

07:17.938 --> 07:22.352
Which I got from Pan in a deal
I don't think he's ready to repeat.

07:22.443 --> 07:24.934
So no one's ever left the island
without Pan's permission.

07:25.029 --> 07:26.439
One man.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.355
Her partner in crime. Neal.

07:30.159 --> 07:31.194
How?

07:33.537 --> 07:35.152
Maybe we can find out.

07:47.259 --> 07:50.001

You're not real!

08:36.725 --> 08:37.840
You're dead.

08:37.935 --> 08:40.347
What? Of course I'm real.
What the hell's going on?

08:40.437 --> 08:43.179
You're a vision, just like Belle.

08:45.234 --> 08:48.351
No. No. Hey, listen to me, it's me.

08:48.445 --> 08:51.687
lwas shot, okay? But I survived.

08:51.782 --> 08:53.272
See? I'm alive.

08:53.367 --> 08:54.527
My son is dead!

08:54.618 --> 08:55.949
You're just here to remind me
of my failure.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.025
That's not why I'm here.

08:57.121 --> 08:58.531
-My weakness.
-Put the spear down, please.

08:58.622 --> 09:00.533
You're here to question my resolve.

09:00.624 --> 09:02.364
But you won't succeed.

09:02.459 --> 09:05.121
I will sacrifice my life for Henry.

09:05.254 --> 09:06.619
And nothing will stand in my way.

09:25.774 --> 09:28.151
I thought I'd lost you forever.

09:32.781 --> 09:34.112
l was thinking,

09:35.284 --> 09:38.492
only a king should live in a castle,

09:38.620 --> 09:42.329

We'll start organizing

09:53.177 --> 09:55.088
You think you can hide him from me?

Where is he?

09:58.766 --> 10:00.256
Where is my son?

10:02.186 --> 10:04.427
He's not here, Dark One. I swear!

10:04.521 --> 10:05.806
Don't lie to me!

10:06.690 --> 10:10.023
Magic has led me
to this rat hole of a town.

10:10.110 --> 10:13.193
His trail ends here, in Hamelin.

10:14.698 --> 10:16.780
I know you're hiding him from me!

10:16.867 --> 10:19.199
No, we're not!

10:19.328 --> 10:21.944
Many of our children
went missing last night.

10:22.039 --> 10:25.782
Lured from their beds
by some unholy music.

10:25.876 --> 10:27.286
What kind of music?

10:27.377 --> 10:28.457
From a pipe.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.536
Only the children could hear it.

10:30.631 --> 10:34.044
Some of them tried telling their parents,
but no one believed them.

10:34.176 --> 10:36.383
They were sent back to bed.

10:36.470 --> 10:39.803
And this morning, they were gone.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.473
And who was playing it?

10:43.560 --> 10:45.471
No one saw his face.

10:45.562 --> 10:46.972
Only a figure,

10:47.064 --> 10:50.227
hidden by a pied cloak
of multicolored patches,

10:50.734 --> 10:54.226
leading the children from their homes
and into the forest.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.152
Don't you see?

10:56.240 --> 10:59.073
It has to be the same man
that has taken your son!

11:00.536 --> 11:03.699
Then whoever this Pied Piper is,

11:04.873 --> 11:08.331
he's about to play his last note.

11:10.546 --> 11:11.752
How is it possible?

11:11.880 --> 11:12.915
It's kind of a long story.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.588
Let's just say that the debt Robin Hood
owes you has been paid.

11:15.717 --> 11:16.923
You were back in our land?

11:17.052 --> 11:18.087
Yeah.

11:18.554 --> 11:19.589
But I made it here.

11:19.680 --> 11:22.342
The only thing that matters now
is that | help Emma save Henry.

11:22.432 --> 11:23.421
Where is she?

11:23.517 --> 11:25.428
I left her and the rest of them
aboard Hook's ship.

11:25.561 --> 11:27.517
As noble as their intentions may be,

11:27.604 --> 11:29.936
they don't have the stomach
to do what needs to be done.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.685
Like what you did to these boys?

11:32.776 --> 11:34.437
They're not...

11:35.612 --> 11:38.274
No, they're just sleeping, for now.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.447
Let's leave it that way, okay?

11:43.120 --> 11:44.951
You don't have the stomach either.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.903
I'll do what needs to be done.

11:48.125 --> 11:50.741
But killing Lost Boys,
we don't have to do that.

11:52.629 --> 11:54.290

25:59.892 --> 26:01.723
What prophecy? What's he mean?

26:01.811 --> 26:03.642
The prophecy that says
you've been tricked.

26:06.274 --> 26:09.061
Your father isn't here
to rescue your son.

26:10.486 --> 26:12.397
He's here to murder him.

26:19.620 --> 26:21.281
What the hell was he talking about?

26:21.372 --> 26:22.361
Oh, don't mind him.

26:22.457 --> 26:23.412
He said you were gonna murder Henry!

26:23.499 --> 26:25.751
He plays games, mind games.

26:25.835 --> 26:29.327
The important thing is
we got the boy and we got away.

26:29.464 --> 26:30.670
Where are we?

26:30.798 --> 26:32.584
The other side of the island.

26:33.009 --> 26:34.840
We're safe here for the time being.

26:34.927 --> 26:37.509
Hey. Henry, it's me. It's your dad.

26:37.638 --> 26:38.923
No. He can't hear you.

26:39.015 --> 26:40.004
Then wake him up.

26:40.141 --> 26:41.847
Pulling him out of the spell
could be dangerous.

26:41.934 --> 26:44.516
He'll wake naturally in a few hours,
he'll be fine.

26:45.313 --> 26:46.678
All right.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.855
Then you can explain
to me what the hell Pan meant.

26:49.525 --> 26:52.232
Which prophecy was he talking about?
Why would he say that you'd kill Henry?

26:52.320 --> 26:53.810
I don't know,
to create a wedge between us.

26:53.905 --> 26:55.190
That's not a denial.

26:57.575 --> 27:00.282
No, this has to do with
what happened when I found you.

27:00.369 --> 27:01.870
You thought I was a hallucination.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.161
You said that you had to do
the right thing and save Henry.

27:04.248 --> 27:05.499
-What did that really mean?
-Baelfire...

27:05.583 --> 27:07.448
lt's Neal!

27:07.543 --> 27:10.660
Now stop dodging
and tell me what's going on.

27:18.095 --> 27:19.710
There was a seer,

27:21.516 --> 27:23.507
and she told me of a prophecy.

27:24.143 --> 27:27.510
That a boy would help
reunite me with you.

27:28.356 --> 27:29.846
And that boy

27:31.901 --> 27:33.937
would be my undoing.

27:36.489 --> 27:37.524
Henry?

27:37.615 --> 27:39.981
I didn't know it was gonna be
my own grandson.

27:40.493 --> 27:43.576
Until I found you in New York
and discovered you were his father.

27:45.081 --> 27:48.494
You were planning on getting rid of him,
whoever he was, weren't you?

27:49.377 --> 27:52.119
To try and cheat fate.
To get around the prophecy.

27:52.213 --> 27:55.501
You cold-blooded son of a bitch.

27:57.093 --> 27:58.958
You were gonna kill him.

28:00.596 --> 28:01.927
Yes.

28:04.725 --> 28:07.102
Get back! Stay away from him!

28:07.186 --> 28:09.177
That was then. Things have changed.

28:09.272 --> 28:10.853
I didn't come here to Neverland
to hurt Henry,

28:10.940 --> 28:12.055
I came here to save him.

28:12.149 --> 28:14.014
After what you just told me,
I'm supposed to believe you?

28:14.110 --> 28:16.021
I won't lie to you, Bae.

28:16.112 --> 28:19.149
Self-preservation has been a nasty
habit I've had my whole life.

28:19.240 --> 28:20.571
But I came here to break it.

28:20.658 --> 28:22.899
To do the right thing
and to save your son

28:22.994 --> 28:25.201
even if that meant
sacrificing my own life.

28:27.623 --> 28:29.784
You have to trust me.

28:29.876 --> 28:31.457
How can I?

28:35.047 --> 28:36.207
(DRUMS PLAYING)

28:36.299 --> 28:37.459
(BOYS WHOOPING)

28:41.345 --> 28:43.336
PAN: You don't even recognize him,
do you, Rumple?

28:43.431 --> 28:44.887
How could I when he's wearing a mask?

28:44.974 --> 28:47.511
He might be wearing a mask,
but that's not the reason.

28:49.186 --> 28:50.346
Look at him.

28:52.940 --> 28:55.181
Playing with other boys.
Out in the world.

28:55.818 --> 28:57.479
He's happy, Rumple.

28:57.570 --> 28:59.356
That's why you don't recognize him.

28:59.906 --> 29:01.021
Bae?

29:02.158 --> 29:03.523
Baelfire!

29:03.618 --> 29:04.733
Are you all right?

29:04.827 --> 29:06.192
I'm fine.

29:06.287 --> 29:07.367
Why are you here?

29:07.455 --> 29:09.662
I know you think I don't care
about you, son, but I do,

29:09.749 --> 29:10.909
and I'm here to prove it.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.911
How?

29:13.002 --> 29:15.038
Go ahead, Rumple.

29:18.966 --> 29:20.046
Papa! What are you doing?

29:20.134 --> 29:21.499
l'm protecting you.

29:21.636 --> 29:22.716
(WHOOSHES)

29:22.803 --> 29:25.089
You're going to regret
not taking my deal, Rumple!

29:27.391 --> 29:28.506
Don't touch me! Get away!

29:28.601 --> 29:30.307
It's all right now, Bae, you're safe.

29:30.394 --> 29:33.101
Safe? l was never in danger!
The Piper was my friend!

29:33.189 --> 29:34.679
He may have wanted you to think that.

29:34.774 --> 29:37.516
But you have to believe me,
he would have hurt you.

29:37.610 --> 29:39.817
Why? Who is he?

29:39.904 --> 29:42.520
Another person that you abused
with your power?

29:44.408 --> 29:46.023
His name is Peter Pan.

29:46.744 --> 29:48.609
I've known him since I was a boy.

29:49.747 --> 29:52.830
Growing up, we were incredibly close.

29:52.917 --> 29:54.828
So you're saying he's immortal, too?

29:55.419 --> 29:57.205
He wasn't always.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.457
He went to a place called Neverland.

29:59.924 --> 30:03.508
He betrayed me, Bae.
He can't be trusted.

30:03.594 --> 30:04.879
What happened?

30:05.388 --> 30:08.630
All that matters is that
he fooled me for a long time

30:08.724 --> 30:10.976
before I'd finally seen his true nature.

30:11.060 --> 30:14.894
And it is darker and more repulsive
than you should ever be exposed to.

30:14.981 --> 30:16.596
He can't be any worse than you.

30:18.192 --> 30:20.854
I had to protect you, Bae.
I didn't have a choice.

30:22.488 --> 30:25.730
Stop lying because I know that you did!

30:26.117 --> 30:28.358
I know about the deal Pan offered you.

30:28.452 --> 30:31.865
He said all you had to do was
ask me if I wanted to come home.

30:32.873 --> 30:34.784
He told you?

30:34.875 --> 30:37.127
He said that way
I'd know if you really trusted me.

30:37.211 --> 30:38.997
If you really cared.

30:39.088 --> 30:41.329
-No, please, Bae...
-You didn't need to.

30:41.424 --> 30:44.757
I would have chosen to come home.
I would have chosen you.

30:47.888 --> 30:49.298
If only you had asked.

30:50.516 --> 30:52.677
Maybe we could have found
a way to be a family again.

30:52.768 --> 30:53.974
We can be.

30:54.395 --> 30:56.852
Bae.Bae!

31:06.949 --> 31:11.158
Tell me what I have to do
to gain your trust and lwill.

31:12.705 --> 31:14.946
Give me The Dark One dagger.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.039
I know you.

31:18.127 --> 31:20.994
I know you wouldn't come all the way
to Neverland without it.

31:21.088 --> 31:24.751
It's the only thing that can control you.
It's the only thing that can stop you.

31:24.842 --> 31:26.503
You wouldn't take any chances with it.

31:26.594 --> 31:28.175
I don't have it.

31:28.262 --> 31:30.799
-Why are you lying?
-l'm not lying to you, Bae.

31:30.890 --> 31:34.223
I hid it so Pan couldn't get it.
So he couldn't stop me.

31:34.310 --> 31:35.265
So unhide it.

31:35.352 --> 31:37.343
-My shadow took it.
-(LAUGHS)

31:37.938 --> 31:39.098
Your shadow.

31:39.190 --> 31:42.148
Man, you got an answer
for everything, don't you?

31:42.234 --> 31:44.270
I'm telling you the truth, I swear.

31:44.361 --> 31:47.103
Maybe you did hide it.
Maybe you do want to do the right thing.

31:47.198 --> 31:49.484
But that's today. What about tomorrow?

31:49.575 --> 31:50.610
I've changed.

31:50.701 --> 31:52.077
-Have you?
-Yes.

31:52.161 --> 31:53.617
The prophecy still stands.

31:53.704 --> 31:56.081
You save him, he's still your undoing.

31:56.749 --> 31:59.365
I'm still willing to die for him.

32:00.252 --> 32:05.417
What happens if we get back
and you're reunited with Belle,

32:05.508 --> 32:08.716
and you realize the only thing standing
between you and your happy ending

32:08.803 --> 32:10.293
is my son?

32:10.387 --> 32:14.300
And suddenly "undoing"
doesn't sound so great.

32:17.645 --> 32:19.886
You're my happy ending.

32:20.815 --> 32:22.601
This is.

32:23.359 --> 32:25.270
Because it's my redemption.

32:26.737 --> 32:29.649
I can be strong, son,

32:30.699 --> 32:32.826
if you have faith in me.

32:42.128 --> 32:45.291
You know when lwas living here
and sleeping in a cave,

32:45.881 --> 32:49.339
| used to dream of you
coming to rescue me.

32:51.053 --> 32:54.420
But then I'd wake up and remember
how you left me behind.

32:56.976 --> 32:59.763
You left your own son behind
for the power of that dagger.

32:59.854 --> 33:02.641
How can I think that things
would ever be any different?

33:12.241 --> 33:13.822
Neal?

33:14.702 --> 33:16.158
What are you doing?

33:18.038 --> 33:21.747
I'm gonna find Emma and the others,
then get the hell off this island.

33:22.459 --> 33:23.835
And I'm gonna get
my family back home.

33:23.919 --> 33:26.831
You can't go into the jungle alone!

33:26.922 --> 33:31.291
Without my power to protect you,
Pan will capture you both!

33:34.430 --> 33:36.512
I'm sorry, I got no choice.

33:38.058 --> 33:39.639
We're safer without you.

33:41.478 --> 33:42.979
Goodbye, Papa.

33:45.566 --> 33:46.772
(CRYING)

33:59.663 --> 34:01.870
How can you be so sure it's a map?

34:03.626 --> 34:08.086
There was a short time in Neverland
when Baelfire was aboard my ship.

34:09.465 --> 34:11.581
I taught him to navigate using the stars.

34:12.301 --> 34:15.088
What you're looking at
is the fruit of my labors.

34:15.179 --> 34:16.259
Then you can read it.

34:16.347 --> 34:17.462
Sadly, no.

34:18.349 --> 34:20.055
I thought you just said
you taught him how.

34:20.142 --> 34:22.007
Yes, but I also taught Neal
something else.

34:22.102 --> 34:24.058
The key to being a pirate.

34:24.146 --> 34:25.556
Secrecy.

34:25.940 --> 34:28.807
The best captains
conceal their maps in code.

34:29.610 --> 34:30.816
And he was an apt pupil.

34:31.904 --> 34:34.896
So, you're saying the only person
who can read this map is Neal?

34:36.700 --> 34:40.067
Which means the only person
who can read it is dead.

34:47.044 --> 34:48.955
-DAV|D: Emma, wait!
-Now is not the time.

34:49.046 --> 34:52.709
I can't even imagine
the sadness you must be feeling.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.506
I'm not sad.

34:54.593 --> 34:55.708
l'm pissed.

34:56.220 --> 34:59.587
Yes, Nealjust died,
but I lost him years ago.

35:01.600 --> 35:04.091
NOICE BREAKING) All that time
thinking that he didn't love me.

35:04.186 --> 35:06.643
Only to find out that he did,
and it was too late.

35:07.815 --> 35:10.056
I can't even tell him
how angry that makes me,

35:10.150 --> 35:12.357
or how much it hurt when he left

35:12.444 --> 35:14.901
or how terrified I was
when he came back,

35:16.657 --> 35:18.193
because I knew the moment I saw him

35:19.660 --> 35:23.198
I never stopped loving him.

35:25.207 --> 35:26.708
She'll be okay.

35:26.792 --> 35:28.748
-Really?
-We've done everything we can.

35:28.836 --> 35:30.827
That's the problem.

35:31.672 --> 35:33.628
I have no idea how
to comfort my own daughter.

35:33.716 --> 35:36.628
It's the first thing a mother learns.
And I don't know how.

35:36.719 --> 35:40.303
I know. I feel the same way.
But she is so upset...

35:40.389 --> 35:42.050
How can we even blame her?

35:42.141 --> 35:45.633
If you died,
I would not be able to move on.

35:46.145 --> 35:47.305
You must.

35:47.730 --> 35:49.345
I don't know, I'm just saying,

35:49.440 --> 35:51.021
every day we're here,
something bad could happen.

35:51.108 --> 35:53.224
And if it did, to me,

35:53.777 --> 35:55.313
I'd want you to move on.

35:55.404 --> 35:56.940
To continue. To be happy.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.065
That's really sweet.

36:01.160 --> 36:03.367
But nothing is going to happen to you.

36:04.121 --> 36:05.327
Not while I'm here.

36:26.935 --> 36:28.061
Emma?

36:29.563 --> 36:31.394
You were so close to finding her.

36:33.484 --> 36:34.473
You disappoint me.

36:35.194 --> 36:36.650
I thought I taught you better.

36:36.737 --> 36:40.070
Never break in somewhere
unless you know the way out.

36:40.699 --> 36:41.905
I'll remember that for next time.

36:41.992 --> 36:43.448
There isn't going to be a next time.

36:44.495 --> 36:45.985
But don't blame yourself.

36:46.830 --> 36:49.242
Your father could have
protected you out here, sure,

36:49.333 --> 36:52.370
but then, who would have
protected Henry from him?

36:55.381 --> 36:56.917
Talk about a rock and a hard place.

36:57.007 --> 37:00.044
I will get my son back.
No matter what it takes.

37:00.886 --> 37:02.592
You're not getting it.

37:02.679 --> 37:04.510
That's not the problem.

37:04.598 --> 37:07.135
You got him. I got him back!

37:07.559 --> 37:09.060
It's the game!

37:09.144 --> 37:11.135
No, my boy,

37:11.230 --> 37:15.314
the real problem for you
is that there is no escaping Neverland.

37:16.318 --> 37:19.526
No one gets off this island
without my permission.

37:19.613 --> 37:21.114
I've done it before.

37:21.990 --> 37:23.150
Did you?

37:25.369 --> 37:27.200
Look where you are now.

37:27.704 --> 37:29.490
It's like you never left.

37:31.375 --> 37:32.990
You saying you let me go?

37:33.752 --> 37:36.494
I'm saying everyone's
where I want them.

37:36.755 --> 37:37.995
(HENRY GROANS)

37:38.382 --> 37:40.293
Something to chew on.

37:40.843 --> 37:42.299
You know where to take him.

37:43.345 --> 37:44.676
No! Henry!

37:44.763 --> 37:46.924
Oh, don't worry. It won't be for very long.

37:47.015 --> 37:48.971
-I'm alive!
-Just until I reset the board.

37:49.560 --> 37:51.016
You see, the game is about to change.

37:51.103 --> 37:53.685
Don't give up hope, Henry!
I will come for you!

37:53.772 --> 37:55.273
I promise!

37:56.233 --> 37:57.598
(WHOOSHING)

38:02.156 --> 38:03.362

38:07.286 --> 38:08.651
I'm so sorry, Rumple.

38:10.664 --> 38:12.450
Neal should have trusted you.

38:15.961 --> 38:17.792
How could he?

38:19.965 --> 38:21.956
After everything I've done?

38:23.469 --> 38:24.584
Well...

38:25.012 --> 38:28.379
He may not know
what was in your heart, but I do.

38:29.224 --> 38:31.431
You would have protected Henry.

38:31.518 --> 38:36.353
You would've even given your own life
to show Neal that you've changed.

38:39.026 --> 38:43.611
Are you asking me?
Or do you truly believe that?

38:46.492 --> 38:48.778
I know it with all my heart.

38:51.371 --> 38:55.034
What I don't know
is why you look so upset now.

38:55.792 --> 38:58.579
I mean, Rumple, he's alive.

38:58.670 --> 38:59.955
Baelfire.

39:00.047 --> 39:02.379
You have something to live for.

39:05.302 --> 39:07.042
But the prophecy remains.

39:10.682 --> 39:12.468
Henry is still my undoing.

39:14.436 --> 39:16.097
That's why you're upset.

39:16.730 --> 39:20.268
You were so determined
to die for the boy, but now?

39:20.359 --> 39:21.644
Having something to live for

39:21.735 --> 39:25.148
has brought back that nasty habit
of self-preservation, hasn't it?

39:27.866 --> 39:29.026
Rumple,

39:30.118 --> 39:34.282
habits can be broken, can't they?

39:38.669 --> 39:40.205
Go away, Belle.

39:42.631 --> 39:45.088
I don't want to talk right now.

39:54.142 --> 39:55.348
(DRUMS PLAYING)

39:55.435 --> 39:56.971
(LOST BOYS WHOOPING)

39:58.855 --> 40:00.015
(GROANS)

40:02.526 --> 40:03.811
What happened?

40:03.902 --> 40:05.483
Oh, you fell asleep.

40:05.571 --> 40:06.811
I did?

40:06.905 --> 40:09.146
Don't worry. It was just a little cat nap.

40:09.825 --> 40:11.315
The night's still young.

40:12.077 --> 40:13.738
(WHOOPING CONTINUES)

40:19.001 --> 40:20.832
Wait, I remember something.

40:21.503 --> 40:23.004
My dad...

40:23.547 --> 40:26.505
When lwas asleep, I could have sworn
I heard him calling for me.

40:27.009 --> 40:28.044
Really?

40:28.719 --> 40:29.959
It must have been a dream.

40:30.053 --> 40:31.554
How can you be sure?

40:33.890 --> 40:35.505
Because my dad's dead.

40:37.561 --> 40:39.097
I'm sorry, Henry.

40:39.605 --> 40:43.189
It makes sense for us to dream
about the things we've lost,

40:43.275 --> 40:44.765
and the things we hope for.

40:45.777 --> 40:48.894
Like your father being alive.
Or your mother coming to find you.

40:49.364 --> 40:53.198
But eventually, you'll find
new things to dream about.

40:53.910 --> 40:55.571
And when you do,

40:56.538 --> 40:58.369
they'll start to come true.

40:59.458 --> 41:00.914
How do you know?

41:01.418 --> 41:03.079
Because that's what I did.

41:03.211 --> 41:05.338
And now you're here.

41:05.422 --> 41:08.960
Neverland used to be a place
where new dreams were born.

41:09.051 --> 41:11.042
You can bring that magic back, Henry.

41:12.429 --> 41:14.260
And we can be your family.

41:21.563 --> 41:23.724
I'd like to play a song.

41:25.942 --> 41:28.809
A song for our guest of honor, Henry.

41:30.822 --> 41:33.609
(PLAYING MELODY)

41:39.164 --> 41:40.745
(WHOOPING CONTINUES)

41:58.475 --> 42:00.807
(VOICE ECHOES) You can hear
the music now, can't you, Henry?

42:00.936 --> 42:02.096
(VOICE ECHOES) Yeah!
