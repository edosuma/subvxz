WEBVTT

00:09.096 --> 00:13.578
Up and at 'em, Roscoe.
Time for school.

00:13.665 --> 00:17.626
Shake a leg, Violet.
It's time for your sonogram.

00:18.627 --> 00:20.237
Sorry, Mom.

00:20.324 --> 00:22.022
Got to get
breakfast started.

00:22.109 --> 00:23.849
It's all right. I'm up.

00:23.936 --> 00:25.416
How'd you sleep?

00:25.503 --> 00:26.765
I didn't.

00:26.852 --> 00:28.593
Bad dreams?
Yeah.

00:28.680 --> 00:31.118
I keep having this nightmare
I'm a foot-long hot dog

00:31.205 --> 00:34.164
in a short bun.

00:34.251 --> 00:36.862
Oh, my God,
my back is killing me.

00:36.949 --> 00:39.691
Oh. Sorry, but...

00:39.778 --> 00:42.042
the couch is the best I can do.No, I know.

00:42.129 --> 00:43.782
I'm not complaining.
I just-- wow--

00:43.869 --> 00:46.176
wish I could feel my hands.

00:46.263 --> 00:48.091
Well, it's only
temporary, right?
Oh, yeah.

00:48.178 --> 00:50.093
As soon as I scrape up enough
money, I'll be out of here.

00:50.180 --> 00:53.531
And you will be missed.

00:56.969 --> 00:58.536
[phone ringing]

00:58.623 --> 01:01.148
That's me.

01:01.235 --> 01:03.019
[phone continues ringing]

01:03.106 --> 01:07.458
Must've fallen
under the cushions.

01:08.764 --> 01:10.679
Here, here, here, here!

01:10.766 --> 01:12.637
Let me... let me get it.What are you doing?

01:12.724 --> 01:14.987
I'm helping!

01:15.075 --> 01:17.164
What is wrong
with you?

01:17.251 --> 01:19.383
Get out of my way.No, no, no, no.

01:19.470 --> 01:21.429
Your back hurts. Let me.

01:23.039 --> 01:24.345
Christy,

01:24.432 --> 01:25.824
stop!

01:25.911 --> 01:27.348
[phone continues ringing]

01:27.435 --> 01:29.393
Oh, my God.

01:30.438 --> 01:31.787
[yelps]

01:35.573 --> 01:38.098
I have been sleeping on
this medieval rack for a month

01:38.185 --> 01:42.363
and you never told me
it folds out into a bed?

01:43.451 --> 01:44.713
Didn't I?

01:46.454 --> 01:49.370
I meant to.

01:49.457 --> 01:50.849
Ah, look,

01:50.936 --> 01:52.112
found your phone.

01:52.199 --> 01:54.636
Yay.

01:58.944 --> 02:02.948
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH
access.wgbh.org

02:16.701 --> 02:18.094
[sighs]
Off to work.

02:19.791 --> 02:20.531
See you later.

02:20.618 --> 02:22.968
[loud clang]

02:23.055 --> 02:25.536
All right.

02:25.623 --> 02:27.103
Bye.

02:29.105 --> 02:32.891
Oh, come on.
Don't do the silent thing.

02:32.978 --> 02:35.503
You're a pathetic excuse
for a daughter.

02:36.591 --> 02:37.983
I take it back.

02:38.070 --> 02:40.899
Do the silent thing.

02:40.986 --> 02:44.512
Just so you know, I won't
be here when you get home.

02:44.599 --> 02:46.122
Mom, stop.
No.

02:46.209 --> 02:48.559
You clearly don't want me here,

02:48.646 --> 02:51.083
and I certainly don't want
to be where I'm not welcome.

02:51.171 --> 02:54.696
You are very welcome.

02:54.783 --> 02:57.089
I just thought that...
couches are for visitors

02:57.177 --> 03:01.137
and beds are for... ever.

03:01.224 --> 03:04.271
And would that
have been so awful?

03:04.358 --> 03:05.663
Of course not.

03:05.750 --> 03:07.230
Well, thanks
for the hospitality.

03:07.317 --> 03:08.666
I'll see you around.

03:08.753 --> 03:10.277
[sighs]

03:10.364 --> 03:12.496
No, I don't want you to leave.

03:12.583 --> 03:13.193
Please.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.847
Forgive me.

03:15.934 --> 03:16.196
Stay.

03:20.591 --> 03:23.159
I can't forgive you.

03:23.246 --> 03:25.596
But I will stay.

03:31.080 --> 03:33.474
I can do this myself.

03:33.561 --> 03:36.607
No, no, no. It's
the least I can do.

03:36.694 --> 03:38.653
Yeah, no kidding.

03:41.308 --> 03:43.614
I just hope you understand
I'm gonna need some time

03:43.701 --> 03:45.094
to rebuild my trust in you,

03:45.181 --> 03:46.226
which, frankly,
has been shattered.

03:47.314 --> 03:49.838
Gotcha.

03:50.926 --> 03:51.927
[phone ringing]

03:52.014 --> 03:53.233
[groans]
That's me.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.103
Oh, relax. I got it.

03:54.190 --> 03:56.236
No, wait!

03:56.323 --> 03:59.021
I'm right here.

03:59.108 --> 04:01.545
No! No! No, no, no, no, no!

04:01.632 --> 04:02.938
What...
Ooh...

04:03.025 --> 04:03.243
the hell?

04:07.203 --> 04:10.075
You told me you were broke.

04:10.162 --> 04:11.207
Emotionally!

04:11.294 --> 04:14.166
[phone continues ringing]

04:14.254 --> 04:18.257
She can't talk right now. She's
about to get her ass kicked.

04:21.086 --> 04:25.221
I took you in because
you couldn't pay your own rent.

04:25.308 --> 04:29.312
Well, there's "couldn't"
and-and "didn't want to."

04:29.399 --> 04:31.227
So you lied to me.

04:31.314 --> 04:32.533
Uh...

04:32.620 --> 04:35.623
This couch
folds out.

04:35.710 --> 04:38.016
No, no, no, no, no.
That's done. Old business.

04:38.103 --> 04:41.890
There's a new lie in town!

04:41.977 --> 04:44.458
Fine. Take whatever you need.

04:44.545 --> 04:46.242
Don't try to buy your way
out of this.

04:46.329 --> 04:48.288
You sure? There's $4,000 there.

04:49.376 --> 04:53.075
$4,000?

04:53.162 --> 04:56.121
I have been paying
for everything around here.

04:56.208 --> 04:58.776
I know. And it's really
helped me save.

04:58.863 --> 05:01.257
I only had $3,000
when I moved in.

05:05.870 --> 05:08.786
I can't even talk
to you right now.

05:08.873 --> 05:10.527
I'm ju...

05:10.614 --> 05:12.312
Wow.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.667
Uh...

05:19.754 --> 05:21.451
sweetie?

05:21.538 --> 05:23.323
You're-you're gonna give
that money back to me, right?

05:24.324 --> 05:28.197
Uh, honey?

05:28.284 --> 05:31.287
Don't make Mommy kill you.

05:35.683 --> 05:37.641
[knocking]

05:39.034 --> 05:40.383
Yeah?

05:40.470 --> 05:42.951
BONNIE:
It's your mother.

05:43.038 --> 05:46.520
I don't have a mother.

05:50.262 --> 05:52.395
I made you breakfast.

05:52.482 --> 05:54.310
Oh.

05:54.397 --> 05:55.137
Okay.

05:55.224 --> 05:57.531
Thanks.

05:57.618 --> 05:59.533
There's coffee, oatmeal,

05:59.620 --> 06:03.885
toasted English
and a fruit cup.

06:03.972 --> 06:06.061
Nice.

06:07.105 --> 06:09.586
So... we good?

06:11.719 --> 06:13.764
Sure.

06:13.851 --> 06:15.679
I just hope you understand

06:15.766 --> 06:19.857
I'm gonna need some time
to rebuild my trust in you,

06:19.944 --> 06:22.686
which, frankly,
has been shattered.

06:22.773 --> 06:24.122
Oh, come on.

06:24.209 --> 06:25.733
Y-You didn't want me here,

06:25.820 --> 06:27.169
and I didn't feel like paying
to be here.

06:27.256 --> 06:29.171
Let's just call it even
and move on.

06:30.215 --> 06:31.391
[sighs]

06:31.478 --> 06:33.001
I don't know.

06:33.088 --> 06:35.395
Is there anything else
you haven't told me?

06:35.482 --> 06:36.352
[scoffs, chuckles]

06:36.439 --> 06:39.355
Probably.

06:39.442 --> 06:41.923
Well?

06:42.010 --> 06:43.968
Really? You want to do this?

06:44.055 --> 06:45.883
Yes, I want to do this.You're willing

06:45.970 --> 06:47.929
to come clean about everything
you've kept from me?

06:48.016 --> 06:49.931
Ooh...

06:50.018 --> 06:51.323
Yeah, tricky, isn't it?

06:51.411 --> 06:53.325
[sighs]

06:53.413 --> 06:55.850
Yeah. What the hell?

06:55.937 --> 06:57.025
Let's do it.

06:57.112 --> 06:58.330
Let's put it all on the table.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.768
No harm, no foul?

07:00.855 --> 07:02.639
Yeah, total amnesty.

07:02.726 --> 07:04.032
All right.

07:04.119 --> 07:05.773
You want
to go first?

07:10.517 --> 07:12.954
I'll give you $4,000
if you go first.

07:13.041 --> 07:15.043
Sweet.

07:16.174 --> 07:18.176
[grunts]

07:21.528 --> 07:24.966
You remember your Aunt Jeanine?

07:25.053 --> 07:26.141
Yeah.

07:26.228 --> 07:28.448
She wasn't really your aunt.

07:28.535 --> 07:31.886
She and I were, you know...

07:36.412 --> 07:38.414
Oh, my God.

07:39.981 --> 07:41.678
You were gay?

07:41.765 --> 07:44.812
Not gay so much as
temporarily disgusted with men.

07:45.900 --> 07:48.119
I don't believe it.

07:48.206 --> 07:50.121
Aunt Jeanine used
to take me to the park

07:50.208 --> 07:52.472
and teach me how to shoot hoops
and hit a softball.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.388
Oh.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.347
Your turn.

07:58.434 --> 08:02.177
[breathes deeply]

08:02.264 --> 08:04.048
All right, wow.

08:04.135 --> 08:07.443
I thought we'd warm up,
but you just dove in head first.

08:07.530 --> 08:09.227
That's what she said.

08:11.621 --> 08:12.579
Okay.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.494
I got one.

08:14.581 --> 08:17.105
Remember that kilo of hash
that was stolen from your car?

08:17.192 --> 08:18.149
Yeah.

08:18.236 --> 08:21.892
Best junior prom ever.

08:23.807 --> 08:25.766
Are you kidding me?

08:25.853 --> 08:27.985
I was almost killed
in the desert because of that.

08:28.072 --> 08:29.683
Amnesty.

08:29.770 --> 08:31.336
There was a gun to my head.

08:31.423 --> 08:34.383
They made me dig my own grave.

08:34.470 --> 08:37.429
Ooh, that's too bad.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.258
I was voted queen of the prom.

08:44.001 --> 08:45.437
You're up.

08:50.007 --> 08:53.445
Okay, here's a biggie.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.839
You know what? Never mind,
let me think of something else.

08:55.926 --> 08:57.711
No, I want that one.

08:57.798 --> 08:58.842
What's that?

08:59.930 --> 09:02.063
Um, uh, all right, uh,

09:02.150 --> 09:03.978
the only reason you passed
ninth-grade algebra

09:04.065 --> 09:05.893
is 'cause I gave your teacher
a handy on parents' night.

09:05.980 --> 09:08.765
Nice try.

09:08.852 --> 09:10.288
You told me that
the next morning.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.290
Now give.

09:12.377 --> 09:13.422
[clears throat]

09:15.467 --> 09:17.469
All right.

09:21.430 --> 09:24.433
Alvin Lester Biletnikoff.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.957
Who's that?

09:27.044 --> 09:28.524
Your father.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.572
What?

09:35.183 --> 09:38.360
You always said
you didn't know who he was.

09:38.447 --> 09:40.144
It could have been a dozen guys.

09:40.231 --> 09:42.582
I lied,
I always knew it was Alvin.

09:44.627 --> 09:46.977
Oh, my God.

09:47.064 --> 09:49.023
Whew, that's a load off.

09:49.110 --> 09:51.068
All right, your turn.

09:58.162 --> 09:59.555
CHRISTY:
Are you freaking kidding me?!

09:59.642 --> 10:01.383
I spent my whole life
wondering who he was,

10:01.470 --> 10:02.253
and you knew
the whole time?

10:02.340 --> 10:03.559
BONNIE:
Calm down!

10:03.646 --> 10:06.170
We agreed on amnesty!

10:06.257 --> 10:08.433
CHRISTY:
Screw amnesty and screw you!

10:08.520 --> 10:10.000
What's amnesty?

10:10.087 --> 10:12.350
Uh, it's when you
can't remember stuff.

10:13.656 --> 10:14.744
Watch your brother.

10:14.831 --> 10:15.789
We'll be back
in a few hours.

10:15.876 --> 10:16.659
What's going on?

10:16.746 --> 10:17.965
Nothing,

10:18.052 --> 10:19.183
we have to run
some errands.

10:19.270 --> 10:20.489
Very nice,
lie to your daughter.

10:29.454 --> 10:31.413
How'd you find him?

10:31.500 --> 10:33.458
Google-- I did
the satellite map thing.

10:33.545 --> 10:37.201
The son of a bitch has a pool.

10:37.288 --> 10:38.333
I could have had a pool?

10:38.420 --> 10:40.248
Icould have had a pool.

10:41.553 --> 10:43.468
How long has he
lived in Chico?

10:43.555 --> 10:46.167
I don't keep
tabs on him.
Mom.

10:46.254 --> 10:47.603
17 years.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.474
Married, two kids,
two mortgages,

10:49.561 --> 10:54.088
and he's on the Scientology
mailing list, thanks to me.

10:54.175 --> 10:56.438
Sounds like you have a little
unfinished business with him.

10:56.525 --> 10:58.658
Yeah, if I finish it,
I'll have to go to jail.

11:01.008 --> 11:03.314
Roscoe, it's your turn
to take out the garbage.

11:03.401 --> 11:04.794
I'll do it later.

11:04.881 --> 11:06.056
Pause the video game
and do it now.

11:06.143 --> 11:07.188
I don't have to listen to you.

11:07.275 --> 11:08.232
You're not Mom.

11:08.319 --> 11:09.756
Roscoe.

11:09.843 --> 11:10.800
Let me.

11:13.542 --> 11:15.500
Hey.

11:15.587 --> 11:17.415
You heard your sister;
take out the garbage.

11:17.502 --> 11:18.460
You take it out.

11:18.547 --> 11:21.115
Whoa, little man, not cool.

11:21.202 --> 11:23.117
You need to show some respect.

11:23.204 --> 11:24.509
Bite me.

11:24.596 --> 11:26.686
Okay, go to your room.

11:26.773 --> 11:27.730
No.

11:27.817 --> 11:28.470
I said go to your room.

11:28.557 --> 11:30.080
Luke, relax.

11:30.167 --> 11:31.516
No, he has to learn
to respect his elders.

11:31.603 --> 11:33.780
His elders?

11:33.867 --> 11:36.913
Five minutes ago you were
making armpit farts.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.175
Hang on.

11:40.438 --> 11:43.659
Go. To. Your. Room.

11:43.746 --> 11:47.707
You're. A. Big. Douche.

11:48.751 --> 11:51.885
You want to get spanked?

11:51.972 --> 11:52.581
You want to get kicked
in the nuts?!

11:56.063 --> 11:58.021
Who is this kid?

11:59.762 --> 12:01.677
So, what's he do?

12:01.764 --> 12:03.157
He owns a body shop.

12:03.244 --> 12:05.289
Really, and he has a pool?

12:05.376 --> 12:08.031
Ah, relax, it's above ground.

12:08.118 --> 12:08.684
Want to see a picture of him?

12:08.771 --> 12:10.730
Yeah.

12:13.950 --> 12:14.690
He's Chinese?

12:14.777 --> 12:17.345
Oh, sorry,

12:17.432 --> 12:21.262
that's just a fella I,
you know, keep company with.

12:22.306 --> 12:24.265
Okay.

12:24.352 --> 12:25.483
Here he is.

12:25.570 --> 12:26.528
Here's your father.[bump]

12:26.615 --> 12:28.748
What the hell was that?

12:28.835 --> 12:31.054
Oh, think you killed a possum.

12:31.141 --> 12:32.099
Nope, he's up.

12:34.405 --> 12:36.625
Okay, ha-hang
on before I...

12:36.712 --> 12:38.714
kill again.

12:45.068 --> 12:47.027
Wow.

12:48.724 --> 12:50.595
I don't look anything like him.

12:50.682 --> 12:51.814
He's five-five.

12:53.642 --> 12:56.776
Oh, Daddy.

13:00.344 --> 13:02.259
Is the little
jerk not eating?

13:02.346 --> 13:03.913
He's not a jerk,
and he won't come

13:04.000 --> 13:05.959
out of his room
because he thinks you're a jerk.

13:06.046 --> 13:08.613
Fine, then he doesn't eat.

13:08.700 --> 13:09.701
Probably could use a
good spanking, too.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.703
Are you kidding me?

13:11.791 --> 13:13.053
Is that how you want
to raise our kid?

13:13.140 --> 13:14.663
Hey, this ass got
swatted plenty

13:14.750 --> 13:18.145
and it's a better ass for it.

13:18.232 --> 13:19.668
Well, then we have a problem.

13:19.755 --> 13:22.627
I agree.

13:22.714 --> 13:24.542
What's the problem?

13:24.629 --> 13:27.937
I intend to raise our child
with patience and understanding.

13:28.024 --> 13:29.939
You weren't
raised like that.

13:30.026 --> 13:33.116
Exactly-- I want to do better,
I want to break the cycle.

13:33.203 --> 13:35.640
Wow.

13:35.727 --> 13:37.729
That's ambitious.

13:39.209 --> 13:41.168
Why don't we start now?

13:41.255 --> 13:42.691
Go talk to Roscoe, make peace.

13:42.778 --> 13:46.434
He threatened
my nuts.

13:46.521 --> 13:48.828
For me.

13:50.873 --> 13:52.788
[sighs]

13:52.875 --> 13:54.181
Okay.

13:58.228 --> 14:00.317
Don't worry.

14:00.404 --> 14:02.363
I'm in charge.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.888
[sighs]

14:05.975 --> 14:09.413
Looks like your daddy has a nice
operation going over there.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.067
[sighs]

14:11.154 --> 14:13.113
And he habla espaÃ±ols.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.462
That's considerate.

14:14.549 --> 14:14.810
I like him.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.075
So, what's the plan?
[sighs]

14:20.163 --> 14:22.078
I'm not sure.

14:22.165 --> 14:23.253
Man, my heart is pounding.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.168
Why didn't
you tell me?

14:25.255 --> 14:28.128
Why did you pretend he was just
some faceless stranger?

14:28.215 --> 14:30.782
I don't...

14:30.870 --> 14:34.482
Because I... thought that was...
better than the truth.

14:34.569 --> 14:37.354
Thanks for making that decision
for me.

14:38.399 --> 14:40.575
[sighs]

14:40.662 --> 14:42.577
All right.

14:42.664 --> 14:44.579
Last chance.

14:44.666 --> 14:47.799
I'm about to go over there
and hear his side of the story.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.324
Are you sure you don't want
to tell yours first?

14:52.717 --> 14:54.719
Uh...

14:55.720 --> 14:57.287
Uh...

14:57.374 --> 14:59.289
fine.

14:59.376 --> 15:01.248
Uh... [clears her throat]

15:01.335 --> 15:01.857
I was

15:01.944 --> 15:04.425
sixteen.

15:04.512 --> 15:06.949
I was living with my fifth set
of foster parents,

15:07.036 --> 15:09.343
and I sensed
I was losing their support.

15:09.430 --> 15:11.084
May have been related

15:11.171 --> 15:15.044
to a Trinitron TV
that went missing.

15:15.131 --> 15:16.741
Anyway, I, uh, met your father
shortly thereafter.

15:16.828 --> 15:19.309
Timing was good.

15:19.396 --> 15:20.876
I was between homes,
he had a Winnebago.

15:20.963 --> 15:24.749
So it wasn't a one-night stand?

15:24.836 --> 15:26.229
No. No.

15:27.274 --> 15:28.971
We were in love.

15:29.058 --> 15:31.104
Lived together two years
before I got pregnant.

15:31.191 --> 15:33.323
Wow.

15:33.410 --> 15:35.064
Mm-hmm.

15:35.151 --> 15:37.806
Yeah. He was so excited
he was gonna be a dad.

15:37.893 --> 15:40.896
He brought me strawberry
milkshakes every day.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.898
He made you a crib
out of leather.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.465
And then,

15:44.552 --> 15:46.336
you surprised us
a couple of weeks early

15:46.423 --> 15:48.251
at a...
at a Blue Oyster Cult concert.

15:48.338 --> 15:49.861
My water broke
right in the middle

15:49.949 --> 15:51.646
of "Don't Fear the Reaper."

15:51.733 --> 15:54.127
I never liked that song.

15:54.214 --> 15:55.867
Uh, understandable.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.827
You were stuck in my pelvis
the first time you heard it.

15:58.914 --> 16:00.960
And then, he rushed me
to the hospital where,

16:01.047 --> 16:04.702
thanks to your big head,
I had to have a C-section.

16:04.789 --> 16:05.747
But when it was over,

16:05.834 --> 16:07.923
there you were,

16:08.010 --> 16:09.969
our beautiful baby girl.

16:15.409 --> 16:16.976
It all sounds great.

16:19.108 --> 16:20.327
What happened?

16:20.414 --> 16:22.590
I...

16:22.677 --> 16:24.809
He panicked, I guess. I...

16:26.811 --> 16:28.770
I waited at the hospital

16:28.857 --> 16:29.858
for two days,
but he never came back.

16:29.945 --> 16:33.383
He just left you there?

16:33.470 --> 16:36.560
Us.He left us.

16:38.214 --> 16:40.173
Yeah.

16:42.610 --> 16:44.481
I was discharged Christmas Eve.

16:44.568 --> 16:46.440
[laughing]

16:46.527 --> 16:49.225
I remember sitting
on a bus bench

16:49.312 --> 16:52.359
with you in my arms,
not knowing where to go.

16:53.447 --> 16:55.536
Oh, damn.

16:55.623 --> 16:57.799
What?

16:57.886 --> 17:00.889
I hate it when you become
a real person with feelings.

17:03.196 --> 17:05.023
Sorry. I'm not that crazy
about it, either.

17:05.111 --> 17:08.027
[sniffling]
[sighs]

17:08.114 --> 17:11.987
Now I don't know whether
I want to hug him or kill him.

17:12.074 --> 17:15.208
Well, I don't want to influence
you either way, but...

17:15.295 --> 17:17.862
Mom, put that away, please!

17:17.949 --> 17:19.690
Don't!

17:19.777 --> 17:21.083
Mom!

17:26.696 --> 17:28.830
Okay, miss,
what can I do you for?

17:28.917 --> 17:31.746
Oh. Hi.

17:33.487 --> 17:35.880
I'm Christy.

17:35.967 --> 17:36.968
All right.

17:39.058 --> 17:42.235
Oh, look, we're
the same height.

17:42.322 --> 17:44.280
[laughing]:
Okay.

17:44.367 --> 17:46.587
Just came by
to insult me, did you?

17:46.674 --> 17:48.937
No. No, no, no.

17:49.024 --> 17:53.463
I just wanted
to tell you that...

17:55.857 --> 17:57.293
My car.

17:57.380 --> 18:01.471
I was thinking
about getting it painted.

18:01.558 --> 18:02.820
We can do that.

18:02.907 --> 18:03.865
What kind of car is it?

18:03.952 --> 18:04.866
It's that

18:04.953 --> 18:08.913
'91 Jetta over there.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.916
Ah. Hope you're planning
on painting it brown,

18:12.003 --> 18:15.616
'cause that is one
fantastic piece of crap.

18:15.703 --> 18:17.139
You think?

18:17.226 --> 18:19.272
Yeah, my advice is,
don't waste your money.

18:20.360 --> 18:23.537
Oh. Okay.

18:23.624 --> 18:25.539
I appreciate you being honest.

18:25.626 --> 18:28.455
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

18:31.153 --> 18:33.677
All right, well,

18:33.764 --> 18:34.896
thanks for your time.

18:34.983 --> 18:36.898
No problem.

18:38.987 --> 18:42.077
Oh. Nice-looking family.

18:42.164 --> 18:43.905
Oh, thanks.

18:43.992 --> 18:46.821
Yeah, my oldest son there
is just back from Afghanistan,

18:46.908 --> 18:51.130
and the younger one
is a DJ or something.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.697
I don't really get it.

18:53.784 --> 18:57.745
To me, he just looks like
an idiot playing records.

18:57.832 --> 19:00.356
But I'm sure I did dumber
things when I was his age.

19:00.443 --> 19:02.228
Like what?

19:03.925 --> 19:06.232
Well, like... none
of your business.

19:06.319 --> 19:08.799
Right.

19:08.886 --> 19:10.845
Sorry.

19:10.932 --> 19:13.108
That's okay. And listen,
if you ever get a car

19:13.195 --> 19:15.415
from this century, you
know where to find me.

19:15.502 --> 19:17.504
I do.

19:17.591 --> 19:19.114
Okay. There you go.

19:21.029 --> 19:22.030
[sighs]

19:32.475 --> 19:34.434
[sighs]

19:34.521 --> 19:36.436
You okay?

19:36.523 --> 19:39.874
Not really.

19:39.961 --> 19:43.051
Why didn't you tell him?

19:43.138 --> 19:43.965
I don't know.

19:44.052 --> 19:46.141
I choked.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.448
What did you think of him?

19:48.535 --> 19:51.277
Seems like a nice guy, good dad.

19:51.364 --> 19:53.104
[sighs]

19:53.192 --> 19:55.063
I mean, I wanted to yell at him

19:55.150 --> 19:58.936
for running off on us like
he did, but... what's the point?

19:59.023 --> 20:01.504
We turned out just fine
without him.

20:03.985 --> 20:05.987
[both laugh]

20:07.423 --> 20:09.033
[sighing]:
Oh.

20:09.120 --> 20:11.427
Oh. Oh.
[laughing]

20:11.514 --> 20:14.082
I have never loved you more.

20:14.169 --> 20:16.084
Back at ya.

20:16.171 --> 20:17.651
[chuckles]

20:17.738 --> 20:19.740
[sighs]

20:19.827 --> 20:22.090
You know, there's one more
thing that I kept from you

20:22.177 --> 20:24.832
that you should
probably know.

20:24.919 --> 20:27.182
Okay.

20:27.269 --> 20:28.879
[sighs]

20:28.966 --> 20:31.404
You're two years older
than you think you are.
