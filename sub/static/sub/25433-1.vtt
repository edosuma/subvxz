01:05.290 --> 01:07.248
It was my father's
religious beliefs

01:07.250 --> 01:09.288
that destroyed
our family.

03:01.125 --> 03:04.875
We have to be so very
careful what we believe in.

03:07.332 --> 03:09.248
Hello.

03:09.250 --> 03:13.288
There's a... there's a little
lad coming through to me now.

03:13.290 --> 03:15.250
Come on, come on.

03:16.665 --> 03:19.705
He wants to talk
to someone.

03:19.707 --> 03:22.705
Oh, he's a little...
he's a little lad

03:22.707 --> 03:25.830
and he... and he's
lookin' for his mom.

03:25.832 --> 03:29.538
He's sayin' his name
is... is Rob or Robbie.

03:29.540 --> 03:31.373
Is that... Is that you,
sweetheart?

03:31.375 --> 03:34.455
Stand up, my love.

03:34.457 --> 03:37.498
Mark Van Rhys is one of the
UK's most popular psychics.

03:37.500 --> 03:40.913
He believes that we're making a
documentary about his special powers

03:40.915 --> 03:45.123
whereas, in fact, we are investigating
the many, many complaints

03:45.125 --> 03:46.330
that have been made
against him.

03:46.332 --> 03:48.330
Do what this lady has done

03:48.332 --> 03:51.373
and accept the message.

03:51.375 --> 03:54.163
Mark?
Mark, can you hear me?

03:54.165 --> 03:55.705
Oh, just give us a sign.

03:55.707 --> 03:57.873
Scratch your nose
for a sec, see.

03:57.875 --> 03:59.373
Oh, thank God for that.

03:59.375 --> 04:02.038
It's Steph, right?
The woman's name's Steph.

04:02.040 --> 04:04.455
He calls you mom, but
he's... he's telling me

04:04.457 --> 04:06.205
your name is Steph?

04:06.207 --> 04:07.580
Oh, my God.

04:07.582 --> 04:08.748
Is... Is that right,
my love?

04:08.750 --> 04:10.498
- Are you Steph?
- Yeah.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.955
Okay,
so before the show starts

04:11.957 --> 04:13.788
Van Rhys' team
have audience members

04:13.790 --> 04:16.122
fill out one of these
prayer cards.

04:16.124 --> 04:18.413
There are the name
and details

04:18.415 --> 04:19.956
of the person
they wish to contact

04:19.958 --> 04:22.788
who has passed over
to the other side.

04:22.790 --> 04:25.623
The team then steal
this information

04:25.625 --> 04:27.456
and they feed it back
to Van Rhys

04:27.458 --> 04:30.373
through a hidden earpiece,
which I just hacked into

04:30.375 --> 04:32.831
and, hey, presto,
he's psychic.

04:36.458 --> 04:39.123
My blood hurts, mommy.

04:39.125 --> 04:41.083
My blood hurts.

04:42.375 --> 04:43.788
Why is he saying that?

04:43.790 --> 04:45.663
He had leukemia.

04:45.665 --> 04:47.081
Poor little lamb.

04:47.083 --> 04:50.663
Oh, he's got a cheeky
little smile, hasn't he?

04:50.665 --> 04:52.498
Yes.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.413
Children often make
the best connection

04:54.415 --> 04:57.373
because they're so pure,
you see.

04:57.375 --> 04:58.413
He was such a good boy.

04:58.415 --> 05:01.663
He still is, my sweet,
he still is.

05:01.665 --> 05:03.373
He says he's happy

05:03.375 --> 05:05.373
but he does miss
your cooking.

05:05.375 --> 05:07.248
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am sorry to interrupt.

05:07.250 --> 05:08.456
My name is
Professor Philip Goodman

05:08.458 --> 05:11.456
from the TV program
"Psychic Cheats."

05:11.458 --> 05:13.081
Mr. Van Rhys,
we have got..

05:13.083 --> 05:14.873
Mr. Van Rhys,
we have got proof

05:14.875 --> 05:17.498
that you are being fed information
through a hidden earpiece

05:17.500 --> 05:18.998
and you are passing it off
as contact with the dead...

05:19.000 --> 05:20.413
- Excuse me, sir.
- I beg your pardon.

05:20.415 --> 05:23.206
This is gonna be broadcast
on national television.

05:23.208 --> 05:25.163
Can you deny that you
were using an earpiece?

05:25.165 --> 05:26.456
That's slander.

05:26.458 --> 05:27.538
I can assure you,
you will be hearing

05:27.540 --> 05:28.998
from my solicitor
in due course.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.373
His assistant just
told him that Robbie

05:30.375 --> 05:32.456
was in
Christchurch Hospital.

05:32.458 --> 05:33.748
I can play you the tape.

05:33.750 --> 05:37.331
I'm sorry.
Christchurch Hospital!

05:37.333 --> 05:39.373
He's lyin', isn't he?

05:43.458 --> 05:45.623
The idea of us
and our loved ones dying

05:45.625 --> 05:49.248
just ceasing to exist
is so awful

05:49.250 --> 05:51.581
that we'll believe
anything which gives us hope

05:51.583 --> 05:54.456
that there might be
something beyond.

05:54.458 --> 05:57.663
That fear is known
as existential terror

05:57.665 --> 06:01.540
and the man who coined that phrase was Dr.
Charles Cameron.

06:05.583 --> 06:07.038
So why do you think

06:07.040 --> 06:09.913
the voices
come through you, Jean?

06:09.915 --> 06:11.457
'Cause we love her.

06:12.750 --> 06:15.623
And how many voices
are there?

06:15.625 --> 06:17.540
300.

06:19.250 --> 06:22.206
I moved back in.
I thought it would help.

06:22.208 --> 06:24.748
She's only here 'cause
she ran out of booze.

06:24.750 --> 06:25.748
Mom.

06:25.750 --> 06:28.498
She fingered herself
last night

06:28.500 --> 06:31.748
thinkin'
about John Travolta.

06:31.750 --> 06:34.373
Daddy sees everything.

06:34.375 --> 06:36.373
Jesus!

06:36.375 --> 06:38.081
I've seen this before.

06:38.083 --> 06:40.748
Your mother
feels abandoned

06:40.750 --> 06:42.748
at the death
of your father.

06:42.750 --> 06:43.998
Is she possessed?

06:44.000 --> 06:47.663
No, she's angry that
her husband had died.

06:47.665 --> 06:48.998
As for the vase..

06:51.000 --> 06:52.706
...I did that.

06:52.708 --> 06:56.413
The brain sees
what it wants to see.

06:56.415 --> 06:58.663
When I saw that clip
when I was a boy

06:58.665 --> 07:02.331
it was like
a lightning bolt struck me

07:02.333 --> 07:04.206
'cause it was like
somebody saying

07:04.208 --> 07:07.663
you don't have to have your life
ruled by superstitious fear.

07:07.665 --> 07:10.373
And the way that I'd been
brought up, that was..

07:10.375 --> 07:12.663
Honestly, that was a revelation
'cause I didn't realize

07:12.665 --> 07:14.706
there was a different way
of thinking.

07:14.708 --> 07:17.913
And, uh, from that minute

07:17.915 --> 07:20.163
I... I can remember thinking
that's what I wanna do

07:20.165 --> 07:23.038
that's what I wanna be,
that's who I want to be.

07:23.040 --> 07:24.663
The search
for the missing scientist

07:24.665 --> 07:27.788
and paranormalist, Charles
Cameron, has been called off

07:27.790 --> 07:30.623
three weeks after Mr. Cameron's
car was found abandoned

07:30.625 --> 07:32.456
near his house in Filey.

07:32.458 --> 07:34.663
I think it's ironic
to say the least

07:34.665 --> 07:36.163
that a man
who spent a lifetime

07:36.165 --> 07:39.331
explaining away mysteries
became one himself.

07:39.333 --> 07:41.875
I just wish I could
have met him is all.

09:00.332 --> 09:02.248
Hello, Professor Goodman.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.916
This is Charles Cameron.

09:06.750 --> 09:10.041
I'm sure you're surprised
to hear my voice.

09:11.832 --> 09:16.330
I'm familiar with your work
and I need to see you.

09:16.332 --> 09:18.664
I don't have long.

09:18.666 --> 09:23.039
Please come
to 79 East Shore

09:23.041 --> 09:25.705
Caravan Park..

09:54.875 --> 09:56.789
Hi, Mr. Cameron.
I'm Philip Goodman.

09:56.791 --> 09:58.123
Hello,
I'm Philip Goodman.

09:58.125 --> 09:59.289
Come on.

09:59.291 --> 10:00.748
Hello, Mr. Cameron,
I'm Philip Goodman.

10:00.750 --> 10:01.955
Hello, Charles.

10:01.957 --> 10:03.790
Hello,
I'm Philip Goodman.

10:23.166 --> 10:24.580
Hold on.

10:28.875 --> 10:30.498
Come in.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.457
I'm not paying
to heat the street.

10:45.457 --> 10:47.789
Oh, Jesus.

10:47.791 --> 10:50.705
Come in, sit down.
Sit down, please.

10:50.707 --> 10:52.123
Hello,
I'm Philip Goodman.

10:52.125 --> 10:54.125
I know who you are.

10:56.832 --> 10:58.498
I can't quite
believe this.

10:58.500 --> 11:01.205
No? Why is that?

11:01.207 --> 11:02.873
I think like everybody
else, I just pre..

11:02.875 --> 11:04.455
...sort of presumed
you were dead.

11:04.457 --> 11:07.790
How do you know I'm not?

11:18.500 --> 11:20.164
Can I ask what,
where you've been?

11:20.166 --> 11:22.705
- What's happened?
- Pour me a drink then.

11:22.707 --> 11:23.748
Pour it
from that bottle there.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.455
Bottle there. Pour it!

11:25.457 --> 11:26.790
Okay.

11:39.416 --> 11:40.958
I brought you something.

11:43.916 --> 11:45.833
It's a copy
of my latest book.

11:46.957 --> 11:49.750
- I signed it...
- Aah.

11:51.666 --> 11:52.833
Just stick it there.

11:54.832 --> 11:56.748
I'm so familiar
with your books

11:56.750 --> 11:59.955
and your, your TV work.

11:59.957 --> 12:01.830
I've always felt
a closeness to you.

12:01.832 --> 12:06.580
Save those sentiments
for your wife and family.

12:06.582 --> 12:09.707
What a surprise.
You're not married.

12:12.041 --> 12:13.830
You could always see
the truth, couldn't you?

12:13.832 --> 12:15.080
Truth?

12:15.082 --> 12:17.873
I look back now at my work

12:17.875 --> 12:21.873
with absolute shame.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.955
I see the arrogance
and the disrespect

12:23.957 --> 12:25.998
with which I went
into those homes.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.623
I took pleasure
in pulling those stories

12:28.625 --> 12:29.914
those people apart.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.414
I think you're being
really hard on yourself.

12:31.416 --> 12:35.580
I have seen your work,
Goodman.

12:35.582 --> 12:37.915
You want to know
what I think of it?

12:39.582 --> 12:41.955
It's shit.

12:41.957 --> 12:46.998
You are a conceited,
weak-willed coward.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.330
Editing out
any inconvenient data.

12:48.332 --> 12:49.955
Terrified of anything
that doesn't fit

12:49.957 --> 12:51.664
into your tiny
worldview...

12:51.666 --> 12:53.873
Okay, I'm done. I came here
in good faith because you...

12:53.875 --> 12:55.039
Three cases!

12:55.041 --> 12:57.498
I couldn't explain
three cases

12:57.500 --> 12:59.330
that haunt me still.

12:59.332 --> 13:01.373
Now you go and
investigate if you dare

13:01.375 --> 13:03.705
and come back and tell me
that I am wrong

13:03.707 --> 13:06.039
because I've come to one
inescapable conclusion

13:06.041 --> 13:07.873
and that is
the supernatural

13:07.875 --> 13:10.789
the unseen forces
that surround us

13:10.791 --> 13:12.580
everything that you and I
have spent a lifetime

13:12.582 --> 13:15.875
trying to debunk and
disprove, it's all true.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.832
Every last bit of it.

13:21.582 --> 13:24.914
Please, Mr. Goodman

13:24.916 --> 13:26.830
I'm begging you.

13:26.832 --> 13:29.165
Tell me I am wrong.

13:30.375 --> 13:33.500
I need you to tell me..

13:34.707 --> 13:35.915
...I'm wrong.

15:44.707 --> 15:46.665
Oh, hello, Tony?

15:48.041 --> 15:50.039
Aye, captain.

15:50.041 --> 15:51.998
Hello there.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.123
Hi, I'm Philip Goodman.

15:53.125 --> 15:55.789
Bang! Whoa! Slow.

15:55.791 --> 15:57.166
Too slow.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.955
Yeah, you look
like a teacher.

15:59.957 --> 16:01.498
Do I? Right.

16:01.500 --> 16:04.623
Um, well, technically,
I'm a professor.

16:04.625 --> 16:07.164
They bloody insist
on calling me that

16:07.166 --> 16:10.083
on that TV show that I do,
"Psychic Cheats."

16:11.416 --> 16:14.580
Oh, yeah, that's where
I know you from.

16:14.582 --> 16:17.205
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I seen that.

16:17.207 --> 16:18.582
Yeah, it's shit.

16:20.166 --> 16:22.123
I'm only joking
with you, mate.

16:22.125 --> 16:23.705
I ain't seen it.

16:23.707 --> 16:25.875
I have never even
heard of it, sunbeam.

16:28.375 --> 16:31.248
- Professor, eh?
- Yeah.

16:31.250 --> 16:32.955
You know,
that's the official title

16:32.957 --> 16:34.330
for someone who does
a "Punch And Judy."

16:34.332 --> 16:36.248
I bet you didn't know
that, did you?

16:36.250 --> 16:38.123
- No, I didn't actually.
- There you go then.

16:38.125 --> 16:40.039
The professor
just learned something

16:40.041 --> 16:42.080
from the humble
night watchman.

16:42.082 --> 16:43.414
And that's what you do,
is it?

16:45.957 --> 16:47.707
You're a night watchman?

16:49.207 --> 16:52.123
Actually, I don't wanna
talk about it, mate.

16:52.125 --> 16:53.330
Sorry?

16:53.332 --> 16:55.290
I'm just not feeling
very chatty, sunbeam.

17:01.707 --> 17:03.250
For fuck's sake.

17:08.583 --> 17:11.247
Oh, did I forget to mention
that there was a fee?

17:11.249 --> 17:13.163
- 100 quid.
- 50.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.165
Done.

17:18.958 --> 17:23.083
20, 25..

17:26.833 --> 17:28.165
50.

17:35.290 --> 17:36.163
So that's what
you do, yeah?

17:36.165 --> 17:37.873
You're a night watchman?

17:37.875 --> 17:41.081
Well, I was, you know,
when, um, it happened.

17:41.083 --> 17:43.291
- And now?
- Now?

17:45.040 --> 17:46.331
Let's just say
that immigration

17:46.333 --> 17:48.250
has made things
a bit tough, yeah?

17:53.375 --> 17:56.125
How about family?
You married?

17:57.250 --> 17:59.248
I was married
for 15 years.

17:59.250 --> 18:01.248
You get less for murder,
don't you?

18:03.333 --> 18:05.206
Did you divorce?

18:05.208 --> 18:07.583
She died 23 years ago.

18:08.375 --> 18:10.706
I'm sorry.

18:10.708 --> 18:13.581
If she fell ill now,
they'd smash that cancer.

18:13.583 --> 18:16.038
Different world, isn't it?

18:16.040 --> 18:19.038
Yeah. Any children?

18:19.040 --> 18:21.207
Mind your own
fucking business.

18:23.540 --> 18:25.538
How many more of these questions
have you got, eh, Kojak?

18:25.540 --> 18:27.500
It's worse than getting
car insurance, this.

18:50.708 --> 18:53.083
I got a daughter, Marnie.

18:54.875 --> 18:57.873
I was always
a big Hitchcock fan.

18:57.875 --> 19:00.788
If I had had a boy,
I would've called him Norman.

19:00.790 --> 19:03.498
- How old is she?
- She's 30.

19:03.500 --> 19:07.373
Right, so she was seven
when your wife died.

19:07.375 --> 19:09.165
That must have been tough.

19:10.500 --> 19:12.913
Marnie is not my wife's.

19:12.915 --> 19:14.373
I had a little bit
on the side.

19:14.375 --> 19:15.915
What are you gonna do, eh?

19:17.083 --> 19:19.956
Right.
You see much of her?

19:19.958 --> 19:21.373
Well, I'm done here.
This is bullshit.

19:21.375 --> 19:23.581
I thought you wanted to
talk about what I'd seen.

19:23.583 --> 19:25.375
Tony, I'm just
trying to help.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.500
You can't help me, mate.

19:43.083 --> 19:44.541
She's in hospital.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.748
She's been in there
five years.

19:47.750 --> 19:50.081
Oh, fuck.

19:50.083 --> 19:52.208
Locked-in syndrome
they call it.

19:53.915 --> 19:56.456
Her eyes are open, but..

19:56.458 --> 19:59.250
...everything else
is paralyzed.

20:03.165 --> 20:05.081
If I go and see her,
I... I don't know

20:05.083 --> 20:07.041
if she even knows
if I'm there or not.

20:10.040 --> 20:11.832
I stopped going
in the end.

20:13.250 --> 20:15.208
I couldn't handle it.

20:17.375 --> 20:18.750
My little girl.

20:19.833 --> 20:22.123
I'm sorry.

20:22.125 --> 20:23.915
You apologize a lot,
don't you?

20:25.415 --> 20:27.000
Guilty conscience?

20:30.665 --> 20:32.082
You wanna..

20:33.500 --> 20:35.458
Wanna tell me
about your incident?

20:36.540 --> 20:38.831
You'll think I'm mad.

20:38.833 --> 20:41.250
Everyone else does.
Even my priest.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.833
Ah, you don't believe,
do you?

20:56.540 --> 20:58.875
It was my last night
working that job.

21:00.790 --> 21:02.538
Quarter to 4:00
in the morning.

21:02.540 --> 21:04.500
That is a shit time
of night.

21:05.458 --> 21:07.413
Even after seven years
of doin' that shift

21:07.415 --> 21:09.500
your body never
gets used to it.

21:11.040 --> 21:13.248
That place had a history.

21:13.250 --> 21:15.208
None of it was nice.

21:16.375 --> 21:19.331
Hundreds of years before,
it was, um, it was a..

21:19.333 --> 21:22.041
What do you call it?
A nuthouse for women.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.123
Mad birds roaming
about the place.

21:25.125 --> 21:27.456
Old brasses, drunks

21:27.458 --> 21:29.998
young girls that got
themselves knocked up

21:30.000 --> 21:33.333
newborns that no one
wanted, thrown away.

21:35.665 --> 21:36.832
Miserable.

21:37.958 --> 21:41.163
In the month
leadin' up to that night

21:41.165 --> 21:43.663
two of the new
foreign blokes quit.

21:43.665 --> 21:45.625
They said
they had seen things.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.875
Did you believe them?

21:50.333 --> 21:53.000
I wish I had.
Christ Almighty.

22:35.500 --> 22:37.665
Hello? Marek?

22:40.125 --> 22:42.500
You have to press
the button on the side.

22:46.458 --> 22:51.708
Press the big black button on
the side, you Russian prick.

22:53.915 --> 22:57.163
Yo, Tony.
I am in other building.

22:57.165 --> 23:00.332
Congratulations.
Which other building?

23:01.665 --> 23:05.081
Um, the building
with the blue door.

23:05.083 --> 23:09.288
Alright. You're in
building number three.

23:09.290 --> 23:12.538
Yes, yes, yes.
What do I do?

23:12.540 --> 23:15.582
Well, you sit on your arse
for the next 10 hours.

23:16.625 --> 23:18.788
Every hour
go for a walk round

23:18.790 --> 23:20.663
and then chart it.

23:20.665 --> 23:23.538
Set that timer
that I gave ya.

23:23.540 --> 23:25.663
Other than that,
you do what you want.

23:25.665 --> 23:29.165
I don't know, read,
play chess, learn English.

23:31.458 --> 23:34.248
Okay.
Thank you a lot, Tony.

23:34.250 --> 23:36.040
Alright, Marek.
No worries.

23:45.708 --> 23:48.038
And then she sat down
with a cup of tea

23:48.040 --> 23:49.873
and just went mad.

23:49.875 --> 23:51.456
"That's typical of you,"
she said.

23:51.458 --> 23:53.913
"Lord Muck, always
thinkin' of himself.

23:53.915 --> 23:56.498
"Didn't even cross his mind
to ask if I wanted one, so.."

23:56.500 --> 23:59.663
I'm havin'
a cup of tea, mate.

23:59.665 --> 24:00.956
What do you reckon?

24:00.958 --> 24:04.538
Was I selfish?
Is that what marriage is?

24:04.540 --> 24:07.081
A lifetime sentence
of making

24:07.083 --> 24:09.498
two cups of tea
instead of one?

24:09.500 --> 24:13.581
Or is it good to grab
a bit of healthy me time?

24:13.583 --> 24:16.706
It can oil the wheels
after all.

24:16.708 --> 24:18.413
What do you think?

24:18.415 --> 24:21.248
- Mike in Barnet, hello.
- Hi, Jeff.

24:21.250 --> 24:23.706
Yeah, it sounds silly,
but we like... we like

24:23.708 --> 24:26.038
doing everything
together, whatever it is.

24:26.040 --> 24:28.538
Even if it is just getting a
Chinky on a Saturday night.

24:28.540 --> 24:30.538
Ooh, fried rice. Nice.

24:30.540 --> 24:33.623
We just love it, slobbing in
front of the telly. Perfect.

24:33.625 --> 24:35.581
Oh, thank you
for that, Mike.

24:35.583 --> 24:37.956
You mean a Chinese,
of course, don't you?

24:37.958 --> 24:40.788
Apologies
on Mike's behalf.

24:40.790 --> 24:41.956
But you're right.

24:41.958 --> 24:43.998
Maybe that's the secret
of all.

24:45.915 --> 24:47.290
Oh.

24:56.665 --> 24:58.250
How did that..

25:11.625 --> 25:14.248
...I'd have
been worth a fortune.

25:21.790 --> 25:23.165
What the..

25:24.290 --> 25:25.750
Ah.

25:30.458 --> 25:33.081
...about, you know,
you've got to have this

25:33.083 --> 25:34.206
and you've got
to have that

25:34.208 --> 25:35.663
and they forget
the simple things

25:35.665 --> 25:37.498
you know,
like holding hands.

25:37.500 --> 25:41.163
My husband had a stroke
a few years ago

25:41.165 --> 25:45.456
and, um, he has been
bedridden ever since

25:45.458 --> 25:47.081
but I see him every day
without fail.

25:47.083 --> 25:48.331
I hold his hand,
I tell him..

25:48.333 --> 25:50.081
Oh, well,
that makes you a saint

25:50.083 --> 25:52.206
you silly old bitch.

26:03.665 --> 26:05.790
Oh, Jesus Christ!

26:06.790 --> 26:08.540
Bloody hell.

26:13.750 --> 26:14.833
I don't..

26:52.875 --> 26:53.873
Hello?

26:53.875 --> 26:55.456
Oh, Jesus!

26:55.458 --> 26:56.833
Oh.

26:59.208 --> 27:01.873
Marek? Marek?

27:01.875 --> 27:04.248
Pick up, please,
it's Tony.

27:04.250 --> 27:06.413
Hello, Tony.

27:06.415 --> 27:09.373
Listen, have you been over
here to this building?

27:09.375 --> 27:12.040
Mm, no.
I am in other one.

27:14.875 --> 27:18.081
I don't like
this place, Tony.

27:18.083 --> 27:21.416
It feels... bad.

27:22.665 --> 27:24.913
We have, um

27:24.915 --> 27:27.956
we have a word
for this back home.

27:27.958 --> 27:31.208
It is zloslivy.

27:34.665 --> 27:37.163
Look, don't, um..

27:37.165 --> 27:39.790
don't let them thoughts get
into your head, mate, alright?

27:41.665 --> 27:43.790
Get yourself a radio,
sunbeam. Yeah?

27:45.790 --> 27:48.456
Look, I'm gonna, uh,
take a walk around, right?

27:48.458 --> 27:49.873
You sit tight
for 10 minutes

27:49.875 --> 27:51.663
and I'll call you
when I get back, alright?

27:51.665 --> 27:54.663
Okay.
Thank you a lot, Tony.

27:54.665 --> 27:56.000
Alright, mate.

30:51.375 --> 30:52.790
Hello?

30:55.040 --> 30:56.625
Is anyone there?

31:08.915 --> 31:10.957
Marek? Marek?

31:13.790 --> 31:15.082
Dada?

31:17.415 --> 31:20.456
It is a coma.
A probable lock-in.

31:20.458 --> 31:22.623
He is here for keeps.

31:22.625 --> 31:23.998
Just one of those things.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.040
The lights are on
and nobody's home.

31:34.500 --> 31:35.956
Marek?

31:53.708 --> 31:55.081
Right, listen.

31:55.083 --> 31:57.038
You've got two minutes to
get out of this buildin'

31:57.040 --> 31:58.875
before I come for ya.

32:14.415 --> 32:16.457
Marek, if that's you..

32:20.333 --> 32:23.083
What.. I can't believe this.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.375
Hello?

33:25.958 --> 33:28.666
Oh, what the bloody..

33:31.165 --> 33:32.082
Oh.

33:41.708 --> 33:43.458
I'm not fuckin' about.

33:45.208 --> 33:48.083
Right. Yeah? Yeah?

34:11.791 --> 34:13.081
Shit.

34:20.873 --> 34:22.246
Dada.

34:27.333 --> 34:28.873
I'm comin' in.

34:57.916 --> 35:00.331
Yeah. I got you now.

35:09.291 --> 35:10.458
Yeah.

35:28.333 --> 35:30.583
Let me out! Let me out!

35:34.916 --> 35:36.083
Shit.

35:38.541 --> 35:39.958
What the..

35:56.291 --> 35:58.414
Dada!

36:23.458 --> 36:25.498
Do you know what brought
Tony back to the church?

36:25.500 --> 36:28.248
Uh, you know,
I am not comfortable

36:28.250 --> 36:31.373
talking so directly
about a parishioner.

36:31.375 --> 36:34.039
I'm assuming you have Tony's
permission to talk to me?

36:34.041 --> 36:35.498
Yeah, yeah, of course.

36:35.500 --> 36:37.164
But I can..

36:37.166 --> 36:39.831
I mean, I can ask you some
more indirect questions

36:39.833 --> 36:41.414
if you're comfortable
with that?

36:41.416 --> 36:43.664
- Yes.
- Okay. Great.

36:44.833 --> 36:47.833
Um, so..

36:50.000 --> 36:52.456
So what do you think
is your responsibility

36:52.458 --> 36:55.414
when a grown man like Tony
comes to you and says

36:55.416 --> 36:58.331
that they've had
a supernatural experience?

37:00.041 --> 37:03.164
You know, uh, when I was
a school's chaplain

37:03.166 --> 37:05.123
I would always say
to the boys

37:05.125 --> 37:07.331
"Age is not important
to the Lord.

37:07.333 --> 37:09.750
We are all children
before Him."

37:11.333 --> 37:13.498
If He wants you to believe

37:13.500 --> 37:15.914
He will send you a sign.

37:15.916 --> 37:19.039
That is what
these experiences are.

37:19.041 --> 37:20.373
Signs.

37:20.375 --> 37:22.414
Sure, but..

37:22.416 --> 37:24.456
Uh, Tony, with Tony, uh..

37:24.458 --> 37:27.748
Presumably, Tony told you
about his incident?

37:27.750 --> 37:29.789
Of course.

37:29.791 --> 37:32.789
The spirit.
The unquiet spirit.

37:32.791 --> 37:34.081
Yeah.

37:34.083 --> 37:35.331
So for a moment

37:35.333 --> 37:36.539
let's hypothesize that
that really happened...

37:36.541 --> 37:38.623
Oh, you do not need
to hypothesize.

37:38.625 --> 37:40.289
It did happen.

37:40.291 --> 37:42.748
Tony testifies
that he saw a spirit

37:42.750 --> 37:45.458
and he changed
his ways accordingly.

37:46.416 --> 37:48.373
But in what way
is that not real?

37:48.375 --> 37:52.039
Oh, of course, for Tony's
sighting to be taken seriously

37:52.041 --> 37:54.456
there's got to be some
sort of material evidence.

37:54.458 --> 37:57.831
Because without that,
it's, uh, you know..

37:57.833 --> 38:00.831
Tony has got so much
emotional baggage.

38:00.833 --> 38:03.666
Baggage? We... We are
talking about a man.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.416
Our brother.

38:09.083 --> 38:11.123
I'm so tired
of this modern disregard

38:11.125 --> 38:13.123
for the spiritual life.

38:13.125 --> 38:16.373
How unfashionable it's become
to believe in anything

38:16.375 --> 38:18.500
other than
our own personal gains.

38:20.291 --> 38:24.539
Did Tony tell you what he did
after he had that experience?

38:24.541 --> 38:25.706
No.

38:25.708 --> 38:28.331
He went to see his
daughter, Marnie, again

38:28.333 --> 38:30.914
the very next day.

38:30.916 --> 38:33.331
And when she heard
her father's voice

38:33.333 --> 38:36.581
for the first time
in five years

38:36.583 --> 38:39.456
the doctor said
her heart skipped a beat.

38:39.458 --> 38:43.123
That, I think, professor

38:43.125 --> 38:45.623
tells us everything
we need to know

38:45.625 --> 38:50.458
about the reality of that
experience and its value.

38:51.541 --> 38:53.623
You, Mr. Goodman,
would do well

38:53.625 --> 38:56.458
to think about that with
regard to your own family.

38:57.833 --> 38:59.875
Good day.

39:54.625 --> 39:55.623
Who is it?

39:55.625 --> 39:57.081
Uh, it's
Professor Philip Goodman.

39:57.083 --> 39:58.916
We spoke on the phone.

40:04.541 --> 40:07.539
Do you have an ID
or anything?

40:07.541 --> 40:10.123
You might not be the man
that I spoke to.

40:10.125 --> 40:11.581
I am.

40:15.833 --> 40:18.373
Oh, okay. Here you go.

40:18.375 --> 40:20.333
You sent that
to Charles Cameron.

40:32.125 --> 40:33.541
Come in.

40:41.916 --> 40:43.875
I'll be upstairs, mom.

41:06.500 --> 41:07.791
Professor Goodman?

41:54.666 --> 41:55.750
Simon?

42:17.291 --> 42:18.666
Simon?

42:41.750 --> 42:44.706
- Down here.
- Oh.

42:44.708 --> 42:46.000
Jesus.

42:52.750 --> 42:55.333
Demon.

42:56.416 --> 42:57.541
- Sit down.

43:02.708 --> 43:04.666
Please,
don't touch my books.

43:08.041 --> 43:09.748
God, it's boiling
in here, Simon.

43:09.750 --> 43:10.664
Oh, yeah, yeah, I know.

43:10.666 --> 43:11.664
I just get really cold

43:11.666 --> 43:12.831
and really uncomfortable

43:12.833 --> 43:14.873
so I just like it
to be as comfort..

43:14.875 --> 43:17.206
I just like it
how I like it.

43:25.125 --> 43:26.416
Wow.

43:28.041 --> 43:29.375
Uh, so..

43:30.833 --> 43:31.956
So what are all these..

43:31.958 --> 43:34.289
Where are
these pictures from?

43:34.291 --> 43:35.956
They're from...
They're from all over.

43:35.958 --> 43:37.789
It's my research.

43:37.791 --> 43:39.123
Stuff that I find
on the internet

43:39.125 --> 43:40.164
or books that I'm reading.

43:40.166 --> 43:42.373
Stuff I'm interested in.

43:42.375 --> 43:43.831
I'm just trying to
understand certain things.

43:43.833 --> 43:45.081
So it's helpful
to have all that stuff out

43:45.083 --> 43:46.623
so I can see it
all the time.

43:46.625 --> 43:47.873
Or at least
whenever I want to see it.

43:47.875 --> 43:50.248
If I don't wanna see it,
I can look over there.

43:50.250 --> 43:53.289
The thing
that I don't want..

43:53.291 --> 43:54.831
I don't want people
looking at me and thinking

43:54.833 --> 43:57.081
that I'm mad
'cause I know what I saw.

43:57.083 --> 43:58.914
And that's the thing.
I'm tired.

43:58.916 --> 44:00.873
I'm so tired
and I'm finding it hard

44:00.875 --> 44:01.998
to think straight right now.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.206
But, I mean,
I want to talk about this.

44:04.208 --> 44:05.289
I wanna find out
about this

44:05.291 --> 44:07.164
but I don't want
people to think..

44:07.166 --> 44:09.789
I just want everything
to be straight now.

44:09.791 --> 44:11.789
No frayed edges,
no loose ends.

44:11.791 --> 44:13.750
All straight. All smooth.

44:14.708 --> 44:15.875
I don't want..

44:18.208 --> 44:19.623
I don't want
people thinking that

44:19.625 --> 44:22.791
there's anything
wr... wrong with me.

44:26.375 --> 44:27.375
I see.

44:32.958 --> 44:34.000
You okay?

44:35.875 --> 44:36.791
Yeah.

44:40.791 --> 44:41.916
Okay.

44:43.416 --> 44:44.708
So..

44:46.000 --> 44:48.164
...who else is up here
with us

44:48.166 --> 44:51.039
in the...
in the upstairs room?

44:51.041 --> 44:52.206
No one. It's just us.

44:52.208 --> 44:53.581
No, sorry.
In the top bedroom?

44:53.583 --> 44:55.248
- My brother's old room.
- Right. Your brother.

44:55.250 --> 44:56.539
So is he still
living at home?

44:56.541 --> 44:58.164
Well, Mr. Perfect..

44:58.166 --> 45:01.623
No, he's 25 and married.
He's got a flat.

45:01.625 --> 45:03.583
There's no one here.
It's just us.

45:06.291 --> 45:07.623
- Sorry, I was just up...
- There's nobody here.

45:07.625 --> 45:08.956
I'm telling you
there's nobody here.

45:08.958 --> 45:10.916
Do you wanna go and look?

45:24.000 --> 45:26.166
- No.
- Fine then.

45:29.958 --> 45:32.583
Can you go away, please?
We're trying to talk.

45:39.708 --> 45:41.331
Do you not get on well
with your parents?

45:41.333 --> 45:43.291
They don't care about me.

45:45.291 --> 45:47.458
I know you're still there!

45:57.458 --> 45:59.625
Can you help me?

46:00.875 --> 46:02.875
I'll try.

46:07.750 --> 46:11.706
All I need you to do
is to just..

46:11.708 --> 46:13.914
...just tell me everything
you can about that night.

46:13.916 --> 46:15.956
Everything.

46:15.958 --> 46:18.039
If I can just understand
what happened

46:18.041 --> 46:20.166
then everything
will be fine.

46:25.750 --> 46:28.000
Okay.

46:30.791 --> 46:33.998
I'm not the same person
now as I was. It's..

46:34.000 --> 46:36.916
The world is
n... not the same.

46:38.250 --> 46:40.208
Oh, God.
I feel like such an idiot.

46:41.291 --> 46:42.666
Why?

46:48.666 --> 46:49.833
Yeah.

46:52.625 --> 46:54.583
I was driving
my dad's car.

46:55.583 --> 46:56.956
I failed my test

46:56.958 --> 46:59.125
but I was too afraid
to tell them.

47:00.958 --> 47:03.083
I pretended
that I had passed.

47:12.083 --> 47:14.208
I was driving
without a license.

47:51.958 --> 47:53.664
- Hello?
- Where are you?

47:53.666 --> 47:55.539
I'm in the car. I am on the
way back from the party.

47:55.541 --> 47:57.039
Oh, thank God.

47:57.041 --> 47:59.039
He's in the car, Raymond.

47:59.041 --> 48:01.164
We've been trying to call you.
Where have you been?

48:01.166 --> 48:03.123
I... I'm sorry. There's no
reception near Eddie's.

48:03.125 --> 48:05.123
We've been sitting here
on shpilkes.

48:05.125 --> 48:06.789
You should have been
back hours ago.

48:06.791 --> 48:08.289
Should have been back
hours ago!

48:08.291 --> 48:11.123
Oh, Raymond, for God's
sake, I'm trying to talk..

48:11.125 --> 48:12.083
Hello?

48:27.333 --> 48:28.373
Hello?

48:28.375 --> 48:29.748
Your mother's
gone to bed.

48:29.750 --> 48:31.123
We are very upset.

48:31.125 --> 48:33.081
Dad, I didn't put
the phone down on you.

48:33.083 --> 48:34.081
Oh.

48:34.083 --> 48:36.039
And I'm sorry
that I'm late.

48:36.041 --> 48:38.414
I just found that bloody
housing form for university

48:38.416 --> 48:40.123
that you should have
sent in three weeks ago.

48:40.125 --> 48:41.581
You told me
you'd sent it!

48:41.583 --> 48:44.123
Well, I... I thought...
I thought that I had.

48:44.125 --> 48:46.164
You're a bloody liar,
Simon.

48:46.166 --> 48:47.456
You're a liar.

48:47.458 --> 48:49.039
You might be able
to schmooze your mother

48:49.041 --> 48:50.789
but you cannot
schmooze me.

48:50.791 --> 48:52.414
You lied about that form.

48:52.416 --> 48:54.498
You lied about getting that
Saturday job, didn't you?

48:54.500 --> 48:56.206
What are we gonna
find out next?

48:56.208 --> 48:57.914
That you lied about passing
your driving test?

48:57.916 --> 48:59.206
- Shit.
- I'll tell you what.

48:59.208 --> 49:01.166
I'm sick
to the bloody back teeth.

49:03.375 --> 49:04.916
Shit.

49:16.208 --> 49:18.581
Don't you put the bloody
phone down on me!

49:18.583 --> 49:20.164
I... I... I didn't put
the phone down on you.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.289
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

49:25.291 --> 49:27.164
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my..

49:27.166 --> 49:29.333
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

49:40.875 --> 49:42.208
You okay?

49:54.166 --> 49:55.916
Oh, my God.

50:39.000 --> 50:42.750
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

51:11.875 --> 51:13.083
No signal.

51:31.500 --> 51:33.125
Come on.

52:14.208 --> 52:16.166
Fucking O2.

52:28.208 --> 52:30.414
- Hello? National Breakdown.
- Hello.

52:30.416 --> 52:32.625
Can you give me the car's
registration, please?

52:35.125 --> 52:36.666
Just give me one second.

52:39.291 --> 52:43.458
AG57-EOZ.

52:45.500 --> 52:48.373
Thank you.
And is that Mr. Rif-kind?

52:48.375 --> 52:50.664
Rifkind. Yes.

52:50.666 --> 52:52.539
I'm Simon. I'm his son.

52:52.541 --> 52:53.789
Okay, Simon.

52:53.791 --> 52:55.831
And are you with the car
right now?

53:00.416 --> 53:02.208
Hello, Simon?

53:04.125 --> 53:05.914
Yes.

53:05.916 --> 53:07.331
Yes, I'm right by the car.

53:07.333 --> 53:09.539
Okay,
we have you on the GPS

53:09.541 --> 53:12.373
so we know exactly where you
are and we'll be with you

53:12.375 --> 53:15.914
somewhere between 10
and 45 minutes, okay?

53:15.916 --> 53:18.623
Please come
as quickly as you can.

53:18.625 --> 53:20.831
Thank you, Mr. Rif-kind.
Goodbye.

53:20.833 --> 53:22.208
Rifkind!

53:41.166 --> 53:43.414
What have I done?
What have I done?

54:15.416 --> 54:16.625
Hello?

54:47.000 --> 54:49.958
God, I'm... I'm so sorry.

54:56.416 --> 54:59.791
- Stay!
- Fuck that!

56:09.625 --> 56:13.208
The supernatural are unseen
forces that surround us.

56:31.708 --> 56:34.706
Charles,
I've now investigated

56:34.708 --> 56:36.875
two of your cases
quite thoroughly.

56:38.708 --> 56:41.206
It feels quite simple
to me, really.

56:41.208 --> 56:42.664
The brain sees
what it wants to see.

56:42.666 --> 56:44.873
They're your words,
Charles.

56:44.875 --> 56:46.498
Tony Matthews
is an alcoholic

56:46.500 --> 56:48.331
who's wrestling
with unresolved grief.

56:48.333 --> 56:51.706
And Simon
is a fragile young man

56:51.708 --> 56:54.706
and from a deeply
dysfunctional family

56:54.708 --> 56:56.206
who's on the edge
of psychosis.

57:06.500 --> 57:08.998
I understand
all too well, Charles

57:09.000 --> 57:11.414
how easy it is
to get confused

57:11.416 --> 57:14.664
and to lose faith
in one's own judgment.

57:14.666 --> 57:18.458
Especially when we're
tired and emotional..

57:21.791 --> 57:23.583
...and unwell.

57:49.916 --> 57:51.081
What the..

57:56.791 --> 57:58.706
Keep up, Goodman.

57:58.708 --> 58:01.498
Thing is, I'm the soppy one
if you can believe that.

58:01.500 --> 58:03.456
I wanted kids from the
moment we got together

58:03.458 --> 58:05.123
but Maria said, "No, it's
not gonna happen, babe."

58:05.125 --> 58:06.123
Maria is your wife, yeah?

58:06.125 --> 58:07.289
Yeah, of course, she is.

58:07.291 --> 58:08.664
Do you know why
she didn't want children?

58:08.666 --> 58:10.998
Presumably, you were
comfortable financially.

58:11.000 --> 58:12.623
Oh, Jesus.

58:12.625 --> 58:15.539
That's all your lot ever think
about, isn't it? Money.

58:15.541 --> 58:17.581
Sorry, what exactly
do you mean by your lot?

58:17.583 --> 58:18.748
No way
was she getting pregnant

58:18.750 --> 58:20.706
until she was made
a partner at the firm.

58:20.708 --> 58:22.331
Her words, not mine.

58:22.333 --> 58:23.789
Priorities.

58:23.791 --> 58:24.873
Someone's got to earn
the money

58:24.875 --> 58:26.664
so you brainy poofters
can sit around

58:26.666 --> 58:28.414
stroking your chins
and pulling onion

58:28.416 --> 58:29.789
out of your arses
all day long.

58:29.791 --> 58:32.289
Oh, hang on.

58:32.291 --> 58:34.164
Yeah, I've got to do this.

58:34.166 --> 58:36.123
Right.

58:52.083 --> 58:53.581
Alright.

58:53.583 --> 58:55.498
Can we, please,
talk about the incident?

58:55.500 --> 58:57.206
Do you know what they used to
call me when I was trading?

58:57.208 --> 58:58.373
- No.
- The prophet.

58:58.375 --> 58:59.914
I had a sixth sense
of what was going up

58:59.916 --> 59:01.831
and what was coming down.

59:01.833 --> 59:03.623
This isn't about
the financial markets.

59:03.625 --> 59:06.666
I know what it is
you're asking about.

59:10.666 --> 59:11.791
I know.

59:14.125 --> 59:16.000
Come on then, up there.

59:21.625 --> 59:23.914
I made a killing
in the city.

59:23.916 --> 59:27.081
Uh, I built the house.
Real investment property.

59:27.083 --> 59:29.831
And that's where the incident
happened, at the house?

59:29.833 --> 59:32.456
When Maria
finally got partnership

59:32.458 --> 59:34.956
bingo,
time to have a baby.

59:34.958 --> 59:37.664
But she was pushing 40
when we started though.

59:37.666 --> 59:40.873
So, yeah,
she had left it too late.

59:40.875 --> 59:44.206
She was drier than the
Gobi Desert down there.

59:44.208 --> 59:45.706
Still,
I said not to worry.

59:45.708 --> 59:47.331
A splash of IVF

59:47.333 --> 59:49.289
get the old baby machine
working again.

59:49.291 --> 59:51.164
I'd been to school with the
top guy in that field.

59:51.166 --> 59:55.831
So, uh, yeah, 30 grand
later, bull's eye.

59:55.833 --> 59:57.748
The old girl
is finally up the duff.

59:57.750 --> 01:00:02.623
Oh, why is it always the last
key that unlocks everything?

01:00:02.625 --> 01:00:04.539
Hm?

01:00:10.541 --> 01:00:12.748
Et voila.

01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:13.831
So, yeah, everything
was going great

01:00:13.833 --> 01:00:15.164
and then seven months in

01:00:15.166 --> 01:00:17.748
she suddenly
started spotting.

01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:19.789
So we pop her into a clinic
for a couple of days.

01:00:19.791 --> 01:00:21.706
Best care money can buy.

01:00:21.708 --> 01:00:23.248
It was more
like the bloody Savoy!

01:00:25.708 --> 01:00:26.748
So I dropped her off.

01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:28.081
Popped home
to do some paperwork.

01:00:28.083 --> 01:00:30.164
Okay, what time was that?

01:00:30.166 --> 01:00:32.208
It was..

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.914
Quarter to 4:00, hm.

01:02:10.958 --> 01:02:12.041
Hm.

01:02:13.791 --> 01:02:15.125
Hm.

01:02:49.625 --> 01:02:50.625
Hm.

01:04:28.958 --> 01:04:31.956
You're telling me you
actually saw that happen?

01:04:31.958 --> 01:04:33.956
It's my understanding
that a poltergeist

01:04:33.958 --> 01:04:36.748
is an evil spirit
or an angry spirit.

01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:38.289
- Is that true?
- No, it's not.

01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:41.123
There's absolutely no
evidence to support that.

01:04:41.125 --> 01:04:42.956
Hm.

01:04:42.958 --> 01:04:45.164
The guys at the hospital
took Maria in for a scan

01:04:45.166 --> 01:04:47.206
but they didn't
wanna show us.

01:04:47.208 --> 01:04:48.956
They said
there were distortions

01:04:48.958 --> 01:04:50.081
on the screen
or something.

01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:52.748
Sorry.

01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:55.623
I'm right in the middle
of this Chinese thing.

01:05:02.541 --> 01:05:03.414
Yeah, so the scan..

01:05:04.291 --> 01:05:05.539
What..

01:05:10.416 --> 01:05:12.498
A bit, uh,
bit chilly, prof?

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:13.998
Sorry, I, uh..

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.083
Have you ever killed
anything, Mr. Goodman?

01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:19.331
Certainly not.

01:05:19.333 --> 01:05:21.500
Nothing
you'll admit to, eh?

01:05:24.125 --> 01:05:25.456
The doctors
thought it best

01:05:25.458 --> 01:05:27.456
that Maria spend another
night in the hospital

01:05:27.458 --> 01:05:29.248
so I went back
to the house.

01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:31.000
I had a stack of work
to do.

01:05:32.416 --> 01:05:35.706
You're supposed to feel
safe in your own home

01:05:35.708 --> 01:05:37.041
aren't you, Mr. Goodman?

01:05:38.041 --> 01:05:40.083
Do you believe in evil,
professor?

01:05:40.791 --> 01:05:42.623
I didn't..

01:05:42.625 --> 01:05:44.166
...until that night.

01:07:01.708 --> 01:07:03.083
Maria?

01:10:01.375 --> 01:10:02.250
Maria?

01:10:03.332 --> 01:10:04.957
We are dead.

01:10:06.957 --> 01:10:08.580
Why aren't you
in the hospital?

01:10:26.832 --> 01:10:28.582
I managed to get out
of the room.

01:10:30.875 --> 01:10:33.080
I don't know how long I'd been
standing there when the phone rang.

01:10:33.082 --> 01:10:34.625
It was the hospital.

01:10:36.916 --> 01:10:39.083
I knew what they were
going to tell me.

01:10:41.207 --> 01:10:42.414
The prophet.

01:10:50.375 --> 01:10:52.500
Apparently,
the birth was..

01:10:54.541 --> 01:10:56.125
He split her in two.

01:10:59.125 --> 01:11:00.705
I'm glad
Maria never lived to see

01:11:00.707 --> 01:11:02.330
what Barty looked like.

01:11:02.332 --> 01:11:03.875
That would have
destroyed her.

01:11:07.291 --> 01:11:09.875
No one believed that Barty
would have survived this long.

01:11:11.416 --> 01:11:15.664
But somehow
life... finds a way.

01:11:15.666 --> 01:11:17.791
It's what I've learned,
that, uh..

01:11:19.666 --> 01:11:21.250
...life goes on.

01:11:29.041 --> 01:11:30.373
What?

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:37.080
Fuck. Fuck.

01:12:00.375 --> 01:12:01.666
Um..

01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:06.789
Mr. Cameron, I didn't know
you were here.

01:12:06.791 --> 01:12:08.205
I know exactly
what's going on.

01:12:08.207 --> 01:12:11.164
Oh, thank God. What?

01:12:11.166 --> 01:12:14.664
This whole thing's a stupid,
shitty hoax to get you back on TV.

01:12:14.666 --> 01:12:16.414
It's a way of usurping me.

01:12:16.416 --> 01:12:19.789
You are a lonely, jealous, bitter
old man, and that's the truth.

01:12:19.791 --> 01:12:22.123
Mr. Goodman, you wouldn't
know the truth

01:12:22.125 --> 01:12:23.873
if it kissed you
on the lips.

01:12:23.875 --> 01:12:25.289
Well, I know this!

01:12:25.291 --> 01:12:28.039
There is nothing
in any of these stories

01:12:28.041 --> 01:12:29.539
that couldn't be
explained away

01:12:29.541 --> 01:12:31.414
by any intelligent
five-year-old.

01:12:31.416 --> 01:12:32.623
Nothing!

01:12:32.625 --> 01:12:37.830
You just can't find it
in yourself.

01:12:37.832 --> 01:12:40.000
Can you, Philip?

01:12:41.875 --> 01:12:44.998
You can't find
the humility

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.289
to admit that perhaps,
just perhaps

01:12:49.291 --> 01:12:52.748
things are not always
as they seem.

01:12:52.750 --> 01:12:56.539
And that is precisely
my point.

01:12:56.541 --> 01:13:01.580
Everything, everything
is exactly as it seems.

01:13:01.582 --> 01:13:04.748
You sure about that?

01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:06.205
Yes.

01:13:45.375 --> 01:13:47.582
You don't know
everything.

01:13:48.541 --> 01:13:50.664
Do you, bubala?

01:13:56.250 --> 01:13:57.414
Oh.

01:14:14.625 --> 01:14:16.416
Sorry, can we cut?

01:14:19.291 --> 01:14:20.833
Who are you talking to?

01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:24.080
Philip..

01:14:24.082 --> 01:14:25.832
...the brain sees..

01:14:26.625 --> 01:14:28.998
...what it wants to see.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.830
Oh, I really wanna
show you something.

01:14:31.832 --> 01:14:33.000
May I?

01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:13.625
Um..

01:15:19.666 --> 01:15:21.914
In you come.

01:15:21.916 --> 01:15:23.083
Come on.

01:15:24.166 --> 01:15:25.664
It will just be
the four of us.

01:15:25.666 --> 01:15:30.123
You, me, Barty and, uh..

01:15:30.125 --> 01:15:31.500
...you know who.

01:16:01.125 --> 01:16:03.955
One last chance,
Mr. Goodman.

01:16:03.957 --> 01:16:05.539
Anything
you want to tell me?

01:16:05.541 --> 01:16:07.330
About what? I'm..

01:16:07.332 --> 01:16:09.665

Okay, you weren't

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.750
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:27.705
Mr. Brain Box,
clever clogs

01:16:27.707 --> 01:16:29.164
overachiever,
living on his own

01:16:29.166 --> 01:16:30.705
there's no one
there at home.

01:16:30.707 --> 01:16:33.248
Dare you turn some of that
prize-nominated

01:16:33.250 --> 01:16:36.041
never-quite-winning acuity
onto yourself?

01:16:37.416 --> 01:16:39.958
11, 92, 20?

01:16:42.666 --> 01:16:43.666
Ah.

01:16:46.707 --> 01:16:48.332
Come on. Ahem.

01:16:57.166 --> 01:16:59.208
Wait, wait, please.

01:17:00.791 --> 01:17:02.083
I don't like it.

01:17:29.207 --> 01:17:30.750
Do you want to go in?

01:17:36.416 --> 01:17:37.875
I can't.

01:17:45.457 --> 01:17:47.830
That's on my shirt!

01:17:47.832 --> 01:17:49.955
What are you doing, man?

01:17:49.957 --> 01:17:51.665
- Yuck.
- Hey.

01:17:54.875 --> 01:17:56.664
Oi, Jewface!

01:17:56.666 --> 01:17:57.791
Oi, Jewface!

01:17:59.541 --> 01:18:01.373
Come here.

01:18:01.375 --> 01:18:04.289
- I've got to go home.
- Come here.

01:18:04.291 --> 01:18:05.789
I've got to go home
for my tea.

01:18:05.791 --> 01:18:07.789
Or what? Your fat pig
of a mom will eat it?

01:18:10.207 --> 01:18:12.830
I won't tell you again,
mate.

01:18:12.832 --> 01:18:13.750
Get here.

01:18:15.082 --> 01:18:16.540
Come on.

01:18:18.875 --> 01:18:20.248
I'm not going
in there again, Freer.

01:18:20.250 --> 01:18:21.830
I'm not going
in there again, Freer.

01:18:21.832 --> 01:18:23.830
Oh, don't shit yourself.
It is not a gas chamber.

01:18:25.082 --> 01:18:26.332
Stand over there.

01:18:27.625 --> 01:18:28.916
Go on.

01:18:51.041 --> 01:18:52.373
Yes!

01:18:52.375 --> 01:18:54.830
- Alright, pick one up.
- I don't wanna.

01:18:54.832 --> 01:18:56.330
I don't give a shit
what you want.

01:18:56.332 --> 01:18:58.498
Pick it up!

01:18:58.500 --> 01:18:59.541
Go on.

01:19:02.166 --> 01:19:03.580
Put it
in front of your face.

01:19:03.582 --> 01:19:05.957
- What?
- In front of your face!

01:19:08.207 --> 01:19:10.165
Now don't you
fucking move.

01:19:20.082 --> 01:19:21.705
What are you playing?

01:19:22.707 --> 01:19:23.830
What is going on here?

01:19:23.832 --> 01:19:26.375
Hey, Kojak!
Hey, come here, mate.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.414
Oh, my God.

01:19:30.416 --> 01:19:31.623
Come on, mate, quick.

01:19:31.625 --> 01:19:33.039
Hey, Kojak.

01:19:33.041 --> 01:19:35.164
- Wanna be in our gang?
- Can I?

01:19:35.166 --> 01:19:37.330
Yeah, of course, you can,
mate, if you're cool enough.

01:19:37.332 --> 01:19:38.373
Do you think
you're cool enough?

01:19:41.207 --> 01:19:42.455
Where do you think
you're going, Jewface?

01:19:42.457 --> 01:19:44.080
- I need to get home.
- No, bollocks.

01:19:44.082 --> 01:19:45.289
You're staying here.

01:19:45.291 --> 01:19:46.789
You're gonna watch Kojak
do the 10th number.

01:19:46.791 --> 01:19:48.039
Yeah, stay and watch.

01:19:48.041 --> 01:19:49.955
Leave him alone, Freer.
You know he can't count.

01:19:49.957 --> 01:19:51.664
Yeah, I can.
I can count to 100.

01:19:52.666 --> 01:19:53.748
See?

01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:55.498
Right, come here.
Come here.

01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:58.289
You see that
on the side of the Echo?

01:19:58.291 --> 01:20:00.955
- What number is it?
- Six.

01:20:00.957 --> 01:20:03.998
Yeah.
Well done. Well done.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.248
That's the first number
of 10 different numbers

01:20:06.250 --> 01:20:08.539
I've chalked up
on the walls in there.

01:20:08.541 --> 01:20:10.455
All you have to do
to be in our gang

01:20:10.457 --> 01:20:14.123
is go in, right the
way in, keep walking

01:20:14.125 --> 01:20:16.123
until you find
all 10 of the numbers

01:20:16.125 --> 01:20:19.914
and then remember which
is the 10th one, yeah?

01:20:19.916 --> 01:20:22.248
- Callahan, there aren't...
- Mate!

01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:23.955
I just need to remember
the 10th one?

01:20:23.957 --> 01:20:25.998
Yeah, you only need
to remember the 10th one.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.330
Now you've got to look
carefully 'cause some of them

01:20:27.332 --> 01:20:29.539
are quite far apart. Yeah?

01:20:29.541 --> 01:20:31.123
Shut up!

01:20:31.125 --> 01:20:33.830
Now when you come out and tell
me what that 10th number is

01:20:33.832 --> 01:20:36.832
if you tell me the correct
number, you can be in our gang.

01:20:38.791 --> 01:20:40.830
Yeah? I'll start now.

01:20:40.832 --> 01:20:43.830
Now hang on.
You're gonna need this.

01:20:43.832 --> 01:20:46.373
It gets quite dark
in there.

01:20:46.375 --> 01:20:48.955
Alright. Go get that
10th number then.

01:20:48.957 --> 01:20:50.457
- Go on.
- Yay!

01:21:02.582 --> 01:21:03.790
Go on.

01:21:06.666 --> 01:21:08.039
Six.

01:21:08.041 --> 01:21:09.039
Good start.

01:21:20.125 --> 01:21:22.041
79.

01:21:31.457 --> 01:21:33.000
19.

01:21:40.457 --> 01:21:42.248
- What were you gonna say to him?
- Nothing.

01:21:42.250 --> 01:21:44.123
You were gonna tell him there's
no 10th number, weren't you?

01:21:44.125 --> 01:21:45.373
No, I wasn't.

01:21:45.375 --> 01:21:46.455
I bet you weren't
gonna tell him

01:21:46.457 --> 01:21:47.873
you shit yourself
when you tried it.

01:21:47.875 --> 01:21:50.080
So keep it zipped
or else..

01:21:50.082 --> 01:21:51.830
Alright?

01:21:51.832 --> 01:21:53.125
20.

01:22:00.250 --> 01:22:02.705
48.

01:22:02.707 --> 01:22:04.705
I don't like it.
I wanna come out now.

01:22:04.707 --> 01:22:06.750
Oh, don't give up now.

01:22:07.832 --> 01:22:08.914
Please!

01:22:08.916 --> 01:22:10.500
Oh, keep goin'.

01:22:16.082 --> 01:22:18.414
I wanna come out.
It's really narrow.

01:22:18.416 --> 01:22:20.414
Don't you fucking dare,
Kojak!

01:22:20.416 --> 01:22:21.789
We're not letting you
out of there

01:22:21.791 --> 01:22:23.916
until you find that
10th number, alright?

01:23:16.625 --> 01:23:18.041
Callahan!

01:23:21.041 --> 01:23:22.208
Callahan!

01:23:46.207 --> 01:23:48.498
You left him to die
in there, didn't you?

01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:49.664
What could I have done?

01:23:49.666 --> 01:23:51.623
Told someone
when you got home?

01:23:51.625 --> 01:23:53.580
Brought it up
in assembly the next day?

01:23:53.582 --> 01:23:54.830
How about running
into the Echo

01:23:54.832 --> 01:23:56.123
to see
if Desmond needed help?

01:23:56.125 --> 01:23:58.123
It was a fluke,
just one of those things.

01:23:58.125 --> 01:24:00.080
- A horrible accident.
- How convenient for you.

01:24:00.082 --> 01:24:01.414
We didn't know
he was asthmatic.

01:24:01.416 --> 01:24:03.789
The only fluke here
is the fluke in his DNA

01:24:03.791 --> 01:24:06.373
that left him vulnerable
to people like you.

01:24:06.375 --> 01:24:09.164
People like me?

01:24:09.166 --> 01:24:13.164
I've spent my life
trying to help people

01:24:13.166 --> 01:24:14.539
tryin' to put back in

01:24:14.541 --> 01:24:16.580
tryin' to help people
see the truth

01:24:16.582 --> 01:24:20.455
in amongst the sea of
sentimental lies and crap.

01:24:20.457 --> 01:24:21.748
That's...

01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:24.205
Don't laugh at me!

01:24:24.207 --> 01:24:26.664
I wasn't the one
who made him go in there.

01:24:26.666 --> 01:24:31.455
I wasn't the one who called
him Kojak to his face

01:24:31.457 --> 01:24:34.205
and I wasn't the one who
wouldn't let him come out

01:24:34.207 --> 01:24:36.414
when he wanted to.
I did nothing.

01:24:36.416 --> 01:24:38.666
That's right.
You did nothing.

01:24:39.707 --> 01:24:41.830
You passenger.

01:24:41.832 --> 01:24:44.455
And since then how have you
spent your days, Mr. Goodman?

01:24:44.457 --> 01:24:47.205
Reducing life's biggest questions
to atoms and molecules?

01:24:47.207 --> 01:24:48.580
It is just
atoms and molecules.

01:24:48.582 --> 01:24:50.123
What else is there,
for God's sake?

01:24:56.207 --> 01:24:59.082
Hello, here I come.

01:25:00.082 --> 01:25:01.790
Here I come.

01:25:03.166 --> 01:25:05.623
Barty, shh, it's okay.

01:25:05.625 --> 01:25:07.332
Look, look, look.

01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:10.955
Look, it's alright.
Daddy's got meow-meow.

01:25:10.957 --> 01:25:12.040
It's alright.

01:25:16.291 --> 01:25:18.705
Here we go, a big one.

01:25:18.707 --> 01:25:21.580
Open wide. Open wide.
Yeah.

01:25:21.582 --> 01:25:24.664
Yes. Good boy.

01:25:24.666 --> 01:25:25.958
Good boy.

01:25:27.332 --> 01:25:28.250
Good boy.

01:25:32.457 --> 01:25:35.289
Good boy, Barty.

01:25:35.291 --> 01:25:37.333
Oh, there's a good boy.

01:25:41.207 --> 01:25:42.625
Mr. Goodman,

01:25:44.082 --> 01:25:46.080
for all your clever talk

01:25:46.082 --> 01:25:48.705
you're really more scared
than anyone, aren't you?

01:25:48.707 --> 01:25:52.789
And what you've actually been doing
with your life isn't helping others

01:25:52.791 --> 01:25:56.039
it's running
from your greatest fear

01:25:56.041 --> 01:25:59.414
which is that there's more
than the here and now

01:25:59.416 --> 01:26:01.248
and that every action
you've ever taken

01:26:01.250 --> 01:26:04.000
or didn't take
has had an effect.

01:26:05.125 --> 01:26:06.582
It's left a little trace.

01:26:07.791 --> 01:26:10.123
A ghost of itself.

01:26:10.125 --> 01:26:11.500
That's true, isn't it?

01:26:16.291 --> 01:26:17.583
Shh.

01:26:21.041 --> 01:26:22.998
Shh.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.291
He's asleep.

01:26:25.416 --> 01:26:28.289
- Shh.
- Shh.

01:26:28.291 --> 01:26:29.458
Come on.

01:26:33.082 --> 01:26:34.748
Shh.

01:26:52.082 --> 01:26:53.914
Please.

01:26:57.291 --> 01:26:58.500
Callahan.

01:26:59.625 --> 01:27:01.375
Callahan, I'm so sorry!

01:27:10.875 --> 01:27:12.830
Oh, no.

01:27:12.832 --> 01:27:15.330
Oh, no. Not, not again.

01:27:19.791 --> 01:27:21.125
Please.

01:27:26.625 --> 01:27:29.500
Please, please, please,
please, please, please.

01:27:33.457 --> 01:27:34.789
Callahan,
please, please, please.

01:27:34.791 --> 01:27:36.458
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

01:27:37.916 --> 01:27:39.250
Please.

01:27:43.332 --> 01:27:45.500
Callahan. Callahan.

01:29:03.791 --> 01:29:05.830
...and just went mad.

01:29:05.832 --> 01:29:07.580
"That's typical of you,"
she said.

01:29:07.582 --> 01:29:09.623
"Lord Muck, always
thinking of himself."

01:29:09.625 --> 01:29:13.164
Yes, I know I missed
last Friday night, mom.

01:29:13.166 --> 01:29:15.705
I'm sorry. Um, well,
you could tell dad

01:29:15.707 --> 01:29:19.080
that I will be there
this Friday, okay?

01:29:19.082 --> 01:29:22.205
Please, mom, I'm at work.

01:29:22.207 --> 01:29:23.540
I've gotta go.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.625
Love you too. Bye.

01:29:29.582 --> 01:29:31.332
- Ah.
- Mr. Priddle.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.498
Ah, yes.
"Professor Philip Goodman

01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:39.830
"admitted April 13,
3:45 a.m.

01:29:39.832 --> 01:29:41.373
attempted suicide."

01:29:41.375 --> 01:29:44.916
"Failed
self-asphyxiation in his car."

01:29:45.957 --> 01:29:47.205
Silly bugger.

01:29:47.207 --> 01:29:48.748
Shotgun in the mouth,
that's the way to do it!

01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:51.541
Oh, better see this.

01:29:53.582 --> 01:29:55.580
Mm-hmm.

01:29:55.582 --> 01:29:56.832
Ha!

01:30:02.582 --> 01:30:03.875
Right.

01:30:05.625 --> 01:30:09.789
Neurological examination
reveals

01:30:09.791 --> 01:30:12.580
fixed and dilated pupils.

01:30:12.582 --> 01:30:15.789
So what's our verdict,
Dr. Rif-kind?

01:30:15.791 --> 01:30:18.164
Rifkind, uh..

01:30:18.166 --> 01:30:19.873
It, uh, coma.

01:30:19.875 --> 01:30:21.830
Uh, probable lock-in.

01:30:21.832 --> 01:30:23.289
He is here for keeps.

01:30:23.291 --> 01:30:24.664
Yeah, just one
of those things.

01:30:24.666 --> 01:30:27.458
Lights are on,
there's nobody home.

01:30:30.332 --> 01:30:32.998
Well, as my old professor
Charlie Cameron used to say

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.164
"Let's just hope
his dreams are as sweet.

01:30:35.166 --> 01:30:37.373
Next room, laddie,
next room."

01:30:37.375 --> 01:30:38.539
Ha!

01:30:52.791 --> 01:30:54.541
Hello again, sunbeam.

01:30:55.916 --> 01:30:57.291
Don't mind me.

01:30:59.541 --> 01:31:03.833
Love has a way
of, um, conquering.

01:31:06.625 --> 01:31:09.039
Hi, Jeff.
Yes, it sounds silly

01:31:09.041 --> 01:31:10.455
but we like...
we like doing

01:31:10.457 --> 01:31:12.539
everything together,
whatever it is.

01:31:12.541 --> 01:31:14.914
Even if it is just getting a
Chinky on a Saturday night.

01:31:14.916 --> 01:31:16.833
Ooh, fried rice. Nice.

01:31:18.791 --> 01:31:20.664
Alright.

01:31:20.666 --> 01:31:22.955
See you tomorrow.

01:31:22.957 --> 01:31:24.290
Be good.

01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:34.832
Here we go, sunbeam.

01:31:38.625 --> 01:31:40.457
A little change
of scenery.
