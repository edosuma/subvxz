I feel like a bull.

00:31.314 --> 00:34.251
I want to charge.

00:34.253 --> 00:36.719
Speaking of charging, did you
bring your wallet this time?

00:36.721 --> 00:39.991
The last two times
were honest mistakes.

00:40.961 --> 00:43.962
And I fully intend
to pay you back.

00:45.699 --> 00:48.969
Oh, that's just great, Justin.

02:11.079 --> 02:13.147
I'm really glad
we did this.

02:13.149 --> 02:14.549
I've been playing
with kids I met

02:14.551 --> 02:16.251
on the Internet
for too long.

02:17.686 --> 02:21.423
Now that I say that out loud,
I'm really glad we did this.

02:21.425 --> 02:22.958
Mm!

02:22.960 --> 02:24.460
I'll get this.

02:27.631 --> 02:29.466
I'll get it.

02:31.502 --> 02:35.271
Oh, okay, I guess
I'm really gonna get this.

02:35.273 --> 02:36.405
Thanks, Al.

02:36.407 --> 02:38.341
Oh, it's my pleasure.

02:38.343 --> 02:39.909
Are you crying?

02:39.911 --> 02:41.010
What? No, no.

02:41.012 --> 02:42.678
I have, uh, I have allergies.

02:42.680 --> 02:45.614
It's probably the dust
from opening his wallet.

02:49.153 --> 02:50.119
Damn it.

02:50.121 --> 02:51.154
What?

02:51.156 --> 02:52.355
It's Zoey

02:52.357 --> 02:53.657
and her new boyfriend.

02:55.092 --> 02:56.359
I am so sorry.

02:56.361 --> 02:58.995
This is tough
after what she did to you.

02:58.997 --> 03:02.732
Come on,
let's just get this over with.

03:03.968 --> 03:05.502
He didn't deserve it.

03:05.504 --> 03:06.670
He gave her everything.

03:06.672 --> 03:08.539
He actually
has things to give.

03:09.974 --> 03:12.109
Hi, Zoey.

03:12.111 --> 03:14.779
Walden.

03:14.781 --> 03:16.180
Hi.

03:16.182 --> 03:17.315
Lyndsey.

03:17.317 --> 03:17.949
Hi.

03:17.951 --> 03:18.583
Alan.

03:18.585 --> 03:19.817
Pfft!

03:21.220 --> 03:24.755
Um, this is my friend, Peter.

03:24.757 --> 03:26.290
Peter.

03:26.292 --> 03:28.091
Hi. Nice to meet you.

03:28.093 --> 03:28.792
Cheers, mate.

03:28.794 --> 03:29.893
"Cheers, mate.

03:29.895 --> 03:31.194
We hosted the Olympics."

03:33.164 --> 03:34.965
This is a bit awkward.

03:34.967 --> 03:36.233
Why is this awkward?

03:36.235 --> 03:38.268
Oh, yes, that's right,
I remember.

03:38.270 --> 03:40.137
Because you ruined
my best friend's life.

03:40.139 --> 03:40.804
I'm-I'm sorry.

03:40.806 --> 03:42.039
Nice to meet you.

03:42.041 --> 03:44.108
What you did to him was
wanton and reprehensible.

03:44.110 --> 03:45.709
All right, keep moving.
Jezebel!

03:47.145 --> 03:48.846
If it makes you feel any better,

03:48.848 --> 03:51.615
he didn't like you before.

03:53.886 --> 03:56.888
How you doing?
You okay?

03:56.890 --> 03:59.323
Oh, yeah, I'm fine. I mean, my
heart's racing but, you know...

03:59.325 --> 04:01.292
I was talking to Walden.

04:03.362 --> 04:04.629
Yeah, I guess.

04:04.631 --> 04:06.531
I mean, I thought seeing her
with somebody else

04:06.533 --> 04:11.336
would be the end of the world,
but I'm really okay with it.

04:11.338 --> 04:13.005
You're a better man than I am.

04:13.007 --> 04:14.540
We all know that, Alan.

04:16.510 --> 04:17.744
Yeah, I guess what I'm saying is

04:17.745 --> 04:19.745
it wasn't as bad
as I thought it would be.

04:19.748 --> 04:21.848
I mean, clearly Alan has
some unresolved issues,

04:21.850 --> 04:24.551
but I think I'm ready
to move on.

04:24.553 --> 04:26.186
I can definitely help you there.

04:26.188 --> 04:28.321
Uh, where you going
with this, sweetie?

04:28.323 --> 04:30.957
I have a ton of friends who
would die to go out with you.

04:30.959 --> 04:32.192
Really?
Oh, yeah.

04:32.194 --> 04:33.460
That's true.

04:33.462 --> 04:36.329
She has some of the hottest
friends you can imagine.

04:37.265 --> 04:39.799
Uh, that <i>you</i> can imagine,

04:39.801 --> 04:41.001
not that <i>I</i> would.

04:41.003 --> 04:42.235
I mean, why would I?

04:42.237 --> 04:44.337
You're the hottest of
them all, you know?

04:49.010 --> 04:51.545
So what's your type?

04:51.547 --> 04:52.913
I don't know if I have a type.

04:52.915 --> 04:54.048
I mean, I like brunettes,

04:54.050 --> 04:55.483
but well, I married a redhead

04:55.485 --> 04:56.784
and I've dated some blondes.

04:56.786 --> 05:00.488
So I guess what I'm saying is
I'm pro-hair.

05:00.490 --> 05:03.558
Well, in the upper deck not
necessarily around the dugout.

05:03.560 --> 05:04.792
Ah, interesting.

05:04.794 --> 05:06.961
If you're gonna go with
a baseball reference,

05:06.963 --> 05:10.465
I would've gone
with "on the mound." Um...

05:10.467 --> 05:13.268
They all have hair
in the appropriate places.

05:13.270 --> 05:14.469
What else?

05:14.471 --> 05:16.237
I don't know.

05:16.239 --> 05:18.239
I like a girl who's smart,

05:18.241 --> 05:19.774
I like a girl who's funny,

05:19.776 --> 05:23.311
I like a girl who's not gonna
leave me for another guy.

05:23.313 --> 05:24.746
Oh, oh,

05:24.748 --> 05:26.748
and no one who wears
those big furry boots

05:26.750 --> 05:28.183
with shorts or mini-skirts.

05:28.185 --> 05:29.350
You're either hot
or you're cold.

05:29.352 --> 05:30.818
Take a stand, ladies.

05:30.820 --> 05:32.720
I'll take care of it.

05:32.722 --> 05:34.155
So, Walden,

05:34.157 --> 05:36.591
as I told you, Jennifer is
my Pilates instructor.

05:36.593 --> 05:38.427
Yeah, Pilates.

05:40.563 --> 05:43.398
Well, you're certainly whipping
Lyndsey into shape.

05:44.099 --> 05:45.966
Not that you need it.

05:46.935 --> 05:49.403
Not that I was looking.

05:50.472 --> 05:51.972
Not that you're listening.

05:53.341 --> 05:54.408
Oh,

05:54.410 --> 05:55.476
can I take a picture of you?

05:55.478 --> 05:57.011
Okay.

05:57.013 --> 05:59.046
Uploading photo to wall.

05:59.048 --> 06:00.848
"Check out my hot date."

06:00.850 --> 06:02.383
Smiley face.

06:02.385 --> 06:03.951
LOL, right?

06:08.357 --> 06:11.326
So, Pilates,

06:11.328 --> 06:14.696
that's all about strengthening
the core, right?

06:14.698 --> 06:16.864
Hm?

06:18.801 --> 06:22.337
OMG. Cat in a bow tie riding
a skateboard.

06:22.339 --> 06:25.107
Retweeting.

06:25.109 --> 06:27.809
Guy in a bow tie right here.

06:27.811 --> 06:30.979
Oh, good news, one person
already likes our date.

06:30.981 --> 06:33.682
Unfriend.

06:35.051 --> 06:36.452
So what looks good to you?

06:36.454 --> 06:39.521
Actually, I'm
not going to eat.

06:40.790 --> 06:41.857
Nothing?

06:41.859 --> 06:43.592
No, I'm doing a
master cleanse.

06:43.594 --> 06:47.129
So I haven't eaten
solid food in two weeks.

06:47.131 --> 06:48.597
Dawn, you might have
mentioned that

06:48.599 --> 06:50.866
when I told you
we were all going out to dinner.

06:50.868 --> 06:52.934
No, it's no problem;
you guys eat.

06:52.936 --> 06:55.703
This stuff just
flushes you right out.

06:56.939 --> 06:58.473
Well, I guess it's worth it

06:58.475 --> 07:01.342
if it rids the body of all
those toxins and impurities.

07:01.344 --> 07:04.345
Right, and the stuff
that comes out of you.

07:04.347 --> 07:06.414
I swear I found a Barbie head

07:06.416 --> 07:09.016
that I swallowed
in the fifth grade.

07:09.018 --> 07:11.085
Good thing you didn't swallow
her Malibu beach house.

07:11.087 --> 07:13.287
Ouch.

07:13.289 --> 07:15.923
Well, whatever you're doing,
it's working.

07:15.925 --> 07:17.024
You look great.

07:17.026 --> 07:18.559
Thank you.

07:18.561 --> 07:19.827
I also inject myself

07:19.829 --> 07:21.429
with the urine
of pregnant women.

07:23.332 --> 07:26.868
Yeah, I don't think
I'm gonna eat either.

07:26.870 --> 07:29.705
It's got a hormone in it
that helps you lose weight.

07:29.707 --> 07:33.409
Which is ironic because pregnant
women pack on the pounds.

07:33.411 --> 07:35.678
I will never be fat.

07:37.281 --> 07:40.183
Or married.

07:41.618 --> 07:45.488
I can't believe you created
and sold your own company.

07:45.490 --> 07:48.291
You must be incredibly smart.

07:48.293 --> 07:51.360
I don't know, I think it's
more luck and timing.

07:51.362 --> 07:53.763
I think it takes a little bit
more than luck and timing

07:53.765 --> 07:55.799
to make $1.4 billion.

07:57.134 --> 07:58.969
Somebody did their research.

07:58.971 --> 08:01.638
I'll bet women
are after you all the time.

08:01.640 --> 08:04.374
I mean, you could look like him
and they'd still be after you.

08:07.345 --> 08:08.779
I mean...
You know what these women

08:08.781 --> 08:09.980
are thinking, don't you?

08:09.982 --> 08:11.948
"I mean, is this guy gonna ask
for a pre-nup?"

08:11.950 --> 08:13.082
'Cause theoretically,

08:13.084 --> 08:14.985
your alimony payments
would run 75,

08:14.987 --> 08:16.720
$100,000 a month at least.

08:16.722 --> 08:18.722
And that's
without child support.

08:18.724 --> 08:20.256
You're good at math.

08:20.258 --> 08:22.092
You know, I never thought
I wanted kids,

08:22.094 --> 08:24.027
but with the right person,

08:24.029 --> 08:28.164
I could see myself having
an entire litter.

08:29.366 --> 08:31.601
And I could see myself
having a vasectomy.

When she's on her meds,
she's actually lots of fun.

08:45.016 --> 08:47.183
I am.

08:52.156 --> 08:53.356
Hey.

08:53.358 --> 08:54.357
Hey.

08:54.359 --> 08:55.891
Just got off the phone
with Lyndsey.

08:55.893 --> 08:57.059
She's got another friend.

08:57.061 --> 08:58.127
She says this one's perfect.

08:58.129 --> 09:00.462
No, no more women, Alan.

09:00.464 --> 09:03.132
Wait, they were all women,
right?

09:03.134 --> 09:06.535
In the eyes of the law, yes.

09:06.537 --> 09:10.038
The Olympics, eh.

09:10.040 --> 09:12.907
Look, I know some
of the dates didn't work out.

09:12.909 --> 09:14.009
Didn't work out?

09:14.011 --> 09:16.344
One of them used
her roast chicken

09:16.346 --> 09:19.080
to show me where she
was probed by aliens.

09:19.082 --> 09:21.416
Uh, but you have to admit

09:21.418 --> 09:23.618
the chicken
was out of this world.

09:27.356 --> 09:30.291
You do know Lyndsey and I
are just trying to help.

09:30.293 --> 09:32.193
Yeah, I do, and
I appreciate it.

09:32.195 --> 09:33.627
But I think I was wrong.

09:33.629 --> 09:35.562
I just don't think I'm ready
to date right now.

09:35.564 --> 09:36.429
So you're giving up?

09:36.431 --> 09:37.830
No, I'm not giving up.

09:37.832 --> 09:40.600
I just, I want to change
my pattern, you know?

09:40.602 --> 09:43.637
My whole life I've jumped
from one woman to the next.

09:43.639 --> 09:45.573
I thought that was just
because every time you jumped,

09:45.575 --> 09:47.508
another woman slid in under you.

09:47.510 --> 09:49.076
Well, there's that.

09:49.078 --> 09:50.744
But let's face it, Alan,

09:50.746 --> 09:52.546
I went straight
from my mother's house

09:52.548 --> 09:53.614
to being married to Bridget;

09:53.616 --> 09:55.449
from Bridget to dating Zoey,

09:55.451 --> 09:57.084
and now I'm trying
to go from Zoey

09:57.086 --> 10:02.156
to a bunch of starving, crying,
gold-digging, crazy-ass bitches.

10:04.726 --> 10:06.193
Hey, if it weren't
for those women,

10:06.195 --> 10:07.794
I'd still be a virgin.

10:07.796 --> 10:10.197
And there'd be
no reality TV stars.

10:15.704 --> 10:17.839
Look, I'm just gonna
be alone for a while.

10:17.841 --> 10:20.708
And if the real thing
comes along, I'll know it.

10:20.710 --> 10:21.809
Hm, that's true.

10:21.811 --> 10:23.477
You know, I can still remember
the exact instant

10:23.479 --> 10:24.945
that I knew Lyndsey
was the one.

10:24.947 --> 10:26.847
How'd you know?

10:26.849 --> 10:28.381
Uh, she said, "I give up.

10:28.383 --> 10:29.716
You're the one."

10:32.053 --> 10:34.220
Hey, Walden.

10:34.222 --> 10:35.722
Hey.

10:35.724 --> 10:36.623
You here by yourself?

10:36.625 --> 10:38.024
Yes.

10:38.026 --> 10:40.293
I'm alone
and I plan to stay that way.

10:40.295 --> 10:42.729
Oh, well,
if you change your mind,

10:42.731 --> 10:46.198
there's a bachelorette party
in the corner with a couple of

10:46.200 --> 10:48.667
drunk and bitter
bridesmaids.

10:48.669 --> 10:50.402
Fish in a barrel.

10:50.404 --> 10:53.472
That's good to know,
but not tonight.

10:53.474 --> 10:55.441
All right.
What can I get you?

10:55.443 --> 10:56.475
I'll have a beer.

10:56.477 --> 10:58.077
Coming up.

10:58.079 --> 11:00.412
Excuse me.

11:00.414 --> 11:04.650
Can I have your nuts?

11:04.652 --> 11:05.785
What?

11:05.787 --> 11:07.987
Your nuts.

11:16.640 --> 11:18.141
Thank you.

11:18.143 --> 11:19.976
I'm Rose.

11:19.978 --> 11:21.678
Hi, Rose. I'm...

11:21.680 --> 11:23.413
Walden, I know.

11:23.415 --> 11:25.315
I heard the bartender
say "Hey, Walden."

11:25.317 --> 11:28.084
I mean, how else would
I know your name?

11:30.488 --> 11:31.922
It's nice to meet you, Rose.

11:31.924 --> 11:34.090
You too, Walden.

11:35.627 --> 11:38.061
I prefer real books.

11:38.063 --> 11:40.731
Some people do.

11:40.733 --> 11:42.065
You know why I do?

11:42.067 --> 11:43.667
Because if you use this

11:43.669 --> 11:46.903
to fix a wobbly table
it costs you $800?

11:46.905 --> 11:50.539
No, you can't hide
a gun in an iPad.

11:50.541 --> 11:54.477
No, I guess you can't.

11:54.479 --> 11:56.245
Sorry.
I'll leave you alone.

11:56.247 --> 11:58.214
Thanks.

12:04.221 --> 12:06.188
Oh, my God, are you okay?

12:06.190 --> 12:07.623
Nut. I can't breathe.

12:07.625 --> 12:09.191
Okay, don't panic.

12:12.329 --> 12:13.863
Oh.

12:13.865 --> 12:16.031
Thank you.
You saved my life.

12:16.033 --> 12:19.035
Can we get a glass of water
over here?

12:19.037 --> 12:21.670
And I'll have a martini.

12:24.273 --> 12:25.908
All right, I'm getting
ready to leave.

12:25.910 --> 12:27.843
Do you need anything
before I go?

12:27.845 --> 12:29.278
Mm, actually,
if you don't mind...

12:29.280 --> 12:32.314
Just making small talk, Zippy.

12:32.316 --> 12:34.149
Hey.

12:34.151 --> 12:35.518
Hey, how was your night?

12:35.520 --> 12:36.886
Great.

12:36.888 --> 12:39.022
In fact, I met a girl.

12:39.024 --> 12:40.556
Of course you did.

12:40.558 --> 12:42.892
I hate you, but I hate me more.

12:43.761 --> 12:45.328
This girl's
really interesting.

12:45.330 --> 12:46.729
Actually, I think you know her.

12:46.731 --> 12:47.931
Her name is Rose.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.066
See ya.

12:51.268 --> 12:52.936
Wa-- Rose?

12:52.938 --> 12:54.170
Crazy Rose?

12:54.172 --> 12:55.338
She's not crazy.

12:55.340 --> 12:56.973
And you know what?
Name-calling is cruel.

12:56.975 --> 12:59.342
How would you like it if
somebody called you Old Alan,

12:59.344 --> 13:01.544
or Cheap Alan, or Loser Alan?

13:01.546 --> 13:03.012
Somebody does!

13:04.716 --> 13:07.250
Did Rose tell you
she was stalking my brother?

13:07.252 --> 13:08.751
Actually,
she told me everything.

13:08.753 --> 13:10.620
You know,
she was in love with him,

13:10.622 --> 13:12.455
and I get it, when you're
in love with someone,

13:12.457 --> 13:14.224
love makes you do crazy things.

13:14.226 --> 13:17.026
No, crazy makes you
do crazy things.

13:17.028 --> 13:18.795
We all have skeletons
in our closets.

13:18.797 --> 13:22.132
Uh, yes, but in her case,
they may be actual skeletons.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.967
You know what? She told me
you were gonna do this.

13:24.969 --> 13:26.168
Of course she did.

13:26.170 --> 13:27.803
She's devious and deceptive.

13:27.805 --> 13:29.739
She's probably listening
to us right now.

13:29.741 --> 13:30.906
Hey, Rose!

13:30.908 --> 13:32.475
How you doing?

13:33.610 --> 13:35.244
Alan, calm down.

13:35.246 --> 13:37.080
I had a conversation
with the woman.

13:37.082 --> 13:38.548
I'm not marrying her.

13:38.550 --> 13:40.483
I don't even know
if I'll ever see her again.

13:40.485 --> 13:42.652
Oh, you will, trust me.

13:42.654 --> 13:45.054
Her face will be
the last thing you see

13:45.056 --> 13:47.991
before you black out
from the chloroform.

13:52.963 --> 13:55.031
Rose?

13:55.033 --> 13:57.067
Oh, Walden.

13:57.069 --> 13:58.201
Hi.

13:58.203 --> 13:59.469
Hi.

13:59.471 --> 14:00.671
Wait a minute.

14:00.673 --> 14:01.972
You're not stalking me, are you?

14:01.974 --> 14:03.673
Good one.
No, I stop here every day

14:03.675 --> 14:04.908
on my way to work.

14:04.910 --> 14:06.242
It's kind of a ritual.

14:06.244 --> 14:07.544
Really?

14:07.546 --> 14:09.946
There is no way
I would ever have known that.

14:09.948 --> 14:12.015
Do you mind if I join you?

14:12.017 --> 14:14.051
Please.
How can I say no to the man

14:14.053 --> 14:17.121
who saved me
from choking on his nuts?

14:23.094 --> 14:24.594
I told Alan that we met.

14:24.596 --> 14:25.796
Boy, did you call that one.

14:25.798 --> 14:27.064
Oh, let me guess.

14:27.066 --> 14:28.298
At some point did he say,

14:28.300 --> 14:29.866
"She's probably listening
to us right now.

14:29.868 --> 14:31.168
"Hey, Rose!

14:31.170 --> 14:32.502
How you doing?"

14:34.238 --> 14:35.738
It's like you were there.

14:35.740 --> 14:38.141
But I wasn't.

14:38.143 --> 14:40.543
Well, he is very suspicious
of you.

14:40.545 --> 14:42.345
He thinks you have
some kind of plan.

14:42.347 --> 14:44.848
Are you suspicious of me?

14:44.850 --> 14:47.117
I'm more curious
than suspicious.

14:47.119 --> 14:50.620
Good, because that's my plan.

14:50.622 --> 14:54.090
Does your plan include
having dinner with me?

14:54.092 --> 14:57.094
Oh, gee,

14:57.096 --> 14:59.930
I don't know about that.
Why not?

14:59.932 --> 15:01.599
You live in Charlie's old house,

15:01.601 --> 15:02.733
there's Alan...

15:02.735 --> 15:04.335
lots of baggage.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.637
None of that stuff
has anything to do with us.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.606
That's true.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.842
So, what do you say? Dinner?

15:10.844 --> 15:12.877
Okay.

15:12.879 --> 15:15.446
To dinner.

15:15.448 --> 15:16.513
It'll be nice to go out

15:16.515 --> 15:18.349
with someone normal
for a change.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.226
Hello, Alan.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.395
Rose.

15:30.397 --> 15:32.864
You've got a lot of nerve
coming to this house.

15:32.866 --> 15:35.801
As much nerve as you have
still living in it?

15:35.803 --> 15:37.969
Touché.

15:37.971 --> 15:39.304
Wow.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.573
This place looks fantastic.

15:41.575 --> 15:44.342
Don't act like
you haven't seen it before.

15:44.344 --> 15:45.711
I know what you're up to.

15:45.713 --> 15:47.646
Oh, really? What am I up to?

15:47.648 --> 15:49.882
All right, I don't know
specifically what you're up to.

15:49.884 --> 15:53.219
But Walden is my best friend,
and I will not let you hurt him.

15:53.221 --> 15:55.154
And he's very lucky
to have a friend like you,

15:55.156 --> 15:56.522
given what he's been through.

15:56.524 --> 15:58.925
Which you know because
you've been spying on us.

15:58.927 --> 16:00.760
<i>J'accuse!</i>

16:02.263 --> 16:03.463
No.

16:03.465 --> 16:05.565
I know because he told me.

16:05.567 --> 16:07.233
He's very fond of you, Alan.

16:07.235 --> 16:10.036
You finally made a friend;
don't screw it up.

16:10.038 --> 16:12.072
Oh, you're good.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.942
I'm totally confused right now.

16:17.278 --> 16:18.345
Ah, there she is.

16:18.347 --> 16:19.680
Hi, Walden.

16:19.682 --> 16:21.448
Are you two playing nice?

16:21.450 --> 16:23.083
Well, I am.
I don't know what she's up to,

16:23.085 --> 16:24.619
but I know it ends with
the audience yelling,

16:24.621 --> 16:26.354
"Don't go in the cellar!"

16:26.356 --> 16:28.089
You're funny.

16:28.091 --> 16:29.991
He thinks I've hatched
some nefarious plot.

16:29.993 --> 16:31.126
Are you after my money?

16:31.128 --> 16:33.529
No, you're
thinking of Alan.

16:35.699 --> 16:38.801
Are you planning on cloning me

16:38.803 --> 16:40.168
and running my
doppelganger for president,

16:40.170 --> 16:42.504
so you can be the puppet
master of the nation?

16:42.506 --> 16:43.906
Guilty.

16:43.908 --> 16:46.141
Better get a sample
right now.

16:47.043 --> 16:49.511
I get it-- hair, DNA,
the whole...

16:51.681 --> 16:53.448
Just stop worrying.

16:53.450 --> 16:55.083
Don't you have somewhere
you need to be?

16:55.085 --> 16:56.084
Well, as a matter of fact,

16:56.086 --> 16:57.318
Lyndsey and I are going
to the movies.

16:57.320 --> 16:58.486
Have a good time.

16:58.488 --> 17:00.088
Oh, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

17:01.390 --> 17:03.258
Watch yourself, buddy.

17:05.361 --> 17:06.627
He means well.

17:06.630 --> 17:07.729
I know.

17:07.731 --> 17:09.231
Can I pour you a
glass of wine?

17:09.233 --> 17:11.233
Yeah, that'd be great.
All right.

17:11.234 --> 17:13.367
Aha!

17:14.536 --> 17:17.338
Actually, I just forgot my keys.

17:18.574 --> 17:20.108
And your wallet.

17:28.285 --> 17:31.721
I shouldn't have eaten
that whole tub of popcorn.

17:31.723 --> 17:33.690
I'm gonna be
gassy all night.

17:33.692 --> 17:36.926
You know it's gonna take more
than a bloated belly

17:36.928 --> 17:38.628
to put a muzzle on Mr. Pokey.

17:40.498 --> 17:42.532
What was that?

17:42.534 --> 17:45.001
I don't know, but I've got
a bad feeling about this.

17:45.003 --> 17:46.669
Ugh...

17:46.671 --> 17:50.172
I've got a bad feeling
about this.

17:53.310 --> 17:54.877
Walden?

17:56.313 --> 17:57.646
What?

17:58.749 --> 18:00.048
I'm coming in.

18:05.023 --> 18:06.823
Don't worry, buddy.

18:06.825 --> 18:08.791
I told you she was nuts.

18:08.793 --> 18:10.493
Get out of here!

18:10.495 --> 18:11.193
What?

18:11.195 --> 18:12.228
Get out of here.

18:12.230 --> 18:14.596
I'm having the best sex
of my life.

18:14.598 --> 18:17.632
Oh, hi, Alan.

18:18.634 --> 18:19.935
How was the movie?

18:19.937 --> 18:22.304
It was... Wait, is
that a leaf blower?

18:22.306 --> 18:25.440
That's not what they call it
in Amsterdam.

18:48.301 --> 18:50.670
Oh.

18:52.673 --> 18:54.207
Hi, Jake.

18:54.209 --> 18:55.408
Rose?!

18:55.410 --> 18:56.642
What are you doing there?

18:56.644 --> 18:59.178
I'm dating Walden.

18:59.180 --> 19:02.314
I should've seen that coming.

19:02.316 --> 19:03.782
How's the army treating you?

19:03.784 --> 19:05.250
How'd you know I was
in the army?

19:05.252 --> 19:06.718
'Cause I've been spying
on you guys.

19:06.720 --> 19:08.086
What?!

19:08.088 --> 19:09.187
I'm just kidding.

19:09.189 --> 19:11.022
You're wearing a uniform, silly.

19:11.024 --> 19:13.624
Oh, yeah, right.

19:13.626 --> 19:15.193
And don't worry
about the obstacle course.

19:15.195 --> 19:16.294
You'll get it.

19:16.296 --> 19:17.996
Yeah, the rope climb is...

19:17.998 --> 19:19.965
Hey, wait a second,
how did you...?

19:19.967 --> 19:21.867
Got to go, Jake.
I'll tell your dad you called.

19:24.355 --> 19:28.075
How did I know
he was in the army? So cute.
