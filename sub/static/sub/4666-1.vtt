03:50.076 --> 03:54.672
<i>I have sailed the world
Beheld its wonders</i>

03:54.781 --> 03:59.309
<i>From the Dardanelles
To the mountains of Peru</i>

03:59.419 --> 04:03.617
<i>But there's no place like London</i>

04:03.723 --> 04:07.750
<i>No, there's no place like London</i>

04:07.861 --> 04:09.260
Mr. Todd?

04:10.196 --> 04:14.758
<i>You are young
Life has been kind to you</i>

04:18.171 --> 04:22.540
<i>You will learn</i>

04:37.324 --> 04:39.383
<i>There's a hole in the world
like a great black pit</i>

04:39.492 --> 04:41.357
<i>And the vermin of the world inhabit it</i>

04:41.461 --> 04:43.486
<i>And its morals aren't worth
what a pig could spit</i>

04:43.596 --> 04:46.087
<i>And it goes by the name of London</i>

04:47.233 --> 04:49.292
<i>At the top of the hole
sit a privileged few</i>

04:49.402 --> 04:51.302
<i>Making mock of the vermin
in the lower zoo</i>

04:51.404 --> 04:53.133
<i>Turning beauty into filth and greed</i>

04:53.239 --> 04:58.541
<i>I too have sailed the world
and seen its wonders</i>

04:58.645 --> 05:03.139
<i>For the cruelty of men
is as wondrous as Peru</i>

05:03.249 --> 05:07.515
<i>But there's no place like London</i>

05:25.372 --> 05:27.840
<i>Is everything all right, Mr. Todd?</i>

05:29.142 --> 05:31.440
<i>I beg your indulgence, Anthony.</i>

05:32.112 --> 05:34.273
My mind is far from easy.

05:36.249 --> 05:41.414
In these once familiar streets
I feel shadows everywhere.

05:41.688 --> 05:43.019
Shadows?

05:44.557 --> 05:45.854
Ghosts.

05:53.099 --> 05:56.660
<i>There was a barber and his wife</i>

05:56.770 --> 05:59.705
<i>And she was beautiful</i>

06:00.874 --> 06:04.241
<i>A foolish barber and his wife</i>

06:04.344 --> 06:07.370
<i>She was his reason and his life</i>

06:07.480 --> 06:10.643
<i>And she was beautiful</i>

06:11.351 --> 06:15.219
<i>And she was virtuous</i>

06:17.257 --> 06:19.851
<i>And he was</i>

06:22.061 --> 06:25.588
<i>naive</i>

06:33.239 --> 06:36.731
<i>There was another man who saw</i>

06:36.843 --> 06:39.869
<i>that she was beautiful</i>

06:40.647 --> 06:44.083
<i>A pious vulture of the law</i>

06:44.184 --> 06:47.551
<i>Who, with a gesture of his claw</i>

06:47.654 --> 06:51.181
<i>Removed the barber from his plate</i>

06:51.291 --> 06:55.785
<i>Then there was nothing but to wait</i>

06:55.895 --> 06:58.295
<i>And she would fall</i>

06:58.398 --> 07:04.803
<i>So soft, so young
so lost and, oh, so beautiful</i>

07:08.675 --> 07:11.769
<i>And the lady, sir, did she succumb?</i>

07:12.779 --> 07:16.237
<i>Oh, that was many years ago</i>

07:19.953 --> 07:23.286
<i>I doubt if anyone would know</i>

07:32.398 --> 07:34.161
<i>I'd like to thank you, Anthony.</i>

07:34.267 --> 07:38.294
<i>If you hadn't spotted me,
I'd be lost on the ocean still.</i>

07:39.506 --> 07:41.337
Will I see you again?

07:42.642 --> 07:44.974
You might find me if you like.

07:46.646 --> 07:49.479
<i>Around Fleet Street, I wouldn't wonder.</i>

07:51.251 --> 07:53.344
<i>Until then, my friend.</i>

08:03.596 --> 08:05.655
<i>There's a hole in the world
like a great black pit</i>

08:05.765 --> 08:07.824
<i>And it's filled with people
who are filled with shit</i>

08:07.934 --> 08:10.630
<i>And the vermin of the world inhabit it</i>

09:04.657 --> 09:05.681
A customer!

09:05.792 --> 09:07.555
<i>Wait! What's your rush?
What's your hurry?</i>

09:07.660 --> 09:09.890
<i>You gave me such a fright
I thought you was a ghost!</i>

09:09.996 --> 09:12.624
<i>Half a minute, can't you sit?
Sit you down. Sit!</i>

09:12.732 --> 09:15.223
<i>All I meant is that I haven't seen
a customer for weeks!</i>

09:15.335 --> 09:17.803
<i>Did you come here for a pie, sir?</i>

09:17.904 --> 09:20.134
<i>Do forgive me
if me head's a little vague</i>

09:20.239 --> 09:21.228
What was that?

09:21.341 --> 09:25.038
<i>But you'd think we had the plague!
From the way that people keep avoiding</i>

09:25.144 --> 09:26.133
<i>No, you don't.</i>

09:26.245 --> 09:28.338
<i>Heaven knows I try, sir!</i>

09:28.448 --> 09:31.110
<i>But there's no one
comes in even to inhale</i>

09:31.217 --> 09:33.947
<i>Right you are, sir
would you like a drop of ale?</i>

09:34.053 --> 09:37.216
<i>Mind you, I can hardly blame them</i>

09:37.323 --> 09:41.657
<i>These are probably
the worst pies in London</i>

09:41.761 --> 09:44.252
<i>I know why nobody cares to take them</i>

09:44.364 --> 09:47.595
<i>I should know, I make them
But good? No!</i>

09:47.700 --> 09:50.726
<i>The worst pies in London</i>

09:50.837 --> 09:54.705
<i>Even that's polite
The worst pies in London</i>

09:54.807 --> 09:57.298
<i>If you doubt it, take a bite</i>

09:58.711 --> 10:03.478
<i>Is that just disgusting?
You have to concede it</i>

10:03.583 --> 10:05.608
<i>It's nothing but crusting</i>

10:05.718 --> 10:11.315
<i>Here, drink this, you'll need it
The worst pies in London</i>

10:11.424 --> 10:13.949
<i>And no wonder
with the price of meat what it is</i>

10:14.060 --> 10:16.995
<i>When you get it
Never thought I'd live to see the day</i>

10:17.096 --> 10:20.190
<i>Men'd think it was a treat
Finding poor animals</i>

10:20.299 --> 10:21.425
<i>What are dying in the street</i>

10:21.534 --> 10:23.900
<i>Mrs. Mooney has a pie shop</i>

10:24.003 --> 10:26.528
<i>Does her business
but I noticed something weird</i>

10:26.639 --> 10:29.164
<i>Lately all her neighbors' cats
have disappeared</i>

10:29.275 --> 10:32.301
<i>Have to hand it to her
What I calls enterprise</i>

10:32.412 --> 10:34.073
<i>Popping pussies into pies</i>

10:34.180 --> 10:36.341
<i>Wouldn't do in my shop</i>

10:36.449 --> 10:38.974
<i>Just the thought of it's enough
to make you sick</i>

10:39.085 --> 10:42.145
<i>And I'm telling you
them pussycats is quick</i>

10:42.255 --> 10:45.622
<i>No denying times is hard, sir!</i>

10:45.725 --> 10:49.661
<i>Even harder than
the worst pies in London</i>

10:49.762 --> 10:53.425
<i>Only lard and nothing more
Is that just revolting</i>

10:53.533 --> 10:55.501
<i>All greasy and gritty</i>

10:55.601 --> 10:57.796
<i>It looks like it's molting</i>

10:57.904 --> 10:59.895
<i>And tastes like</i>

11:00.006 --> 11:01.405
<i>Well, pity</i>

11:01.507 --> 11:04.704
<i>A woman alone!</i>

11:05.611 --> 11:08.512
<i>With limited wind</i>

11:08.614 --> 11:13.608
<i>And the worst pies in London</i>

11:14.887 --> 11:16.149
<i>Sir</i>

11:16.789 --> 11:18.916
<i>Times is hard</i>

11:19.025 --> 11:24.657
<i>Times is hard</i>

11:27.133 --> 11:31.331
<i>Trust me, dearie, it's gonna take a lot
more than ale to wash that taste out.</i>

11:32.205 --> 11:35.641
<i>Come with me.
We'll get you a nice tumbler of gin, eh?</i>

11:48.387 --> 11:49.376
<i>Isn't this homey, now?</i>

11:51.057 --> 11:53.582
<i>The cheery wallpaper
was a real bargain, too.</i>

11:53.693 --> 11:56.287
It was only partly singed when
the chapel burned down.

11:56.395 --> 11:59.762
<i>There you go.
You sit down, warm your bones.</i>

12:00.399 --> 12:03.334
You've a room over the shop here?

12:03.436 --> 12:05.768
<i>Times is so hard,
why don't you rent it out?</i>

12:05.872 --> 12:08.841
<i>What, up there? No, I won't go near it.</i>

12:11.010 --> 12:13.069
People think it's haunted.

12:14.013 --> 12:15.878
- Haunted?
- Yeah.

12:17.216 --> 12:19.514
And who's to say they're wrong?

12:20.219 --> 12:23.985
<i>You see, years ago,
something happened up there.</i>

12:24.090 --> 12:26.115
Something not very nice.

12:29.195 --> 12:31.959
<i>There was a barber and his wife</i>

12:33.166 --> 12:36.693
<i>And he was beautiful</i>

12:36.803 --> 12:40.170
<i>A proper artist with a knife</i>

12:40.273 --> 12:43.538
<i>But they transported him for life</i>

12:43.643 --> 12:47.079
<i>And he was beautiful</i>

12:48.781 --> 12:52.717
<i>Barker, his name was. Benjamin Barker.</i>

12:53.553 --> 12:55.748
What was his crime?

12:56.088 --> 12:57.680
Foolishness.

12:58.891 --> 13:01.519
<i>He had this wife, you see</i>

13:01.627 --> 13:03.788
<i>Pretty little thing, silly little nit</i>

13:03.896 --> 13:08.026
<i>Had her chance
for the moon on a string</i>

13:08.134 --> 13:10.466
<i>Poor thing</i>

13:11.871 --> 13:14.169
<i>Poor thing</i>

13:15.474 --> 13:17.965
<i>There was this judge, you see</i>

13:18.077 --> 13:22.639
<i>Wanted her like mad
Every day he sent her a flower</i>

13:22.748 --> 13:25.444
<i>But did she come down from her tower?</i>

13:26.219 --> 13:28.983
<i>Sat up there and sobbed by the hour</i>

13:29.522 --> 13:31.547
<i>Poor fool</i>

13:31.791 --> 13:35.022
<i>But there was worse yet to come
poor thing</i>

13:41.767 --> 13:46.431
<i>Well, Beadle calls on her all polite
Poor thing</i>

13:46.873 --> 13:48.500
<i>Poor thing</i>

13:48.608 --> 13:51.702
<i>The Judge, he tells her is all contrite</i>

13:51.811 --> 13:55.042
<i>He blames himself
for her dreadful plight</i>

13:55.147 --> 13:58.207
<i>She must come straight
to his house tonight</i>

13:58.317 --> 14:01.013
<i>Poor thing, poor thing</i>

14:06.192 --> 14:09.218
<i>Of course, when she goes there
Poor thing, poor thing</i>

14:09.328 --> 14:12.161
<i>They're having this ball all in masks</i>

14:12.265 --> 14:15.428
<i>There's no one she knows there
Poor dear, poor thing</i>

14:15.534 --> 14:18.503
<i>She wanders tormented and drinks
Poor thing</i>

14:18.604 --> 14:21.539
<i>The Judge has repented, she thinks
Poor thing</i>

14:21.641 --> 14:24.701
<i>"Oh, where is Judge Turpin?"
She asks</i>

14:26.078 --> 14:29.377
<i>He was there all right
Only not so contrite</i>

14:32.018 --> 14:35.283
<i>She wasn't no match for such craft
you see</i>

14:35.388 --> 14:38.084
<i>And everyone thought it so droll</i>

14:38.190 --> 14:41.057
<i>They figured she had to be daft
you see</i>

14:41.160 --> 14:44.152
<i>So all of them stood there and laughed
you see</i>

14:44.263 --> 14:45.560
<i>Poor soul</i>

14:46.999 --> 14:48.557
<i>Poor thing...</i>

14:56.542 --> 14:57.839
No!

15:00.146 --> 15:02.842
Would no one have mercy on her?

15:03.749 --> 15:05.683
<i>So, it is you,</i>

15:06.519 --> 15:08.214
Benjamin Barker?

15:09.855 --> 15:11.584
Where is Lucy?

15:13.125 --> 15:14.752
Where is my wife?

15:15.328 --> 15:17.296
She poisoned herself.

15:17.997 --> 15:21.091
<i>Arsenic, from the apothecary
around the corner.</i>

15:22.301 --> 15:25.668
<i>Tried to stop her,
but she wouldn't listen to me.</i>

15:29.241 --> 15:31.368
And he's got your daughter.

15:33.546 --> 15:34.877
He?

15:36.015 --> 15:37.607
Judge Turpin?

15:38.851 --> 15:42.082
Adopted her. Like his own.

15:44.023 --> 15:45.547
Fifteen years.

15:46.492 --> 15:49.859
I've sweated in a living hell
on a false charge.

15:51.931 --> 15:56.459
Fifteen years dreaming I might
come home to a wife and child.

15:58.137 --> 16:01.504
<i>Well, I can't say the years have been
particularly kind to you, Mr. Barker.</i>

16:01.607 --> 16:04.098
No. Not Barker.

16:05.344 --> 16:07.039
That man is dead.

16:08.147 --> 16:11.139
It's Todd now. Sweeney Todd.

16:12.918 --> 16:15.148
And he will have his revenge.

16:48.187 --> 16:49.779
Come in.

16:50.156 --> 16:52.488
<i>Nothing to be afraid of, love.</i>

17:39.371 --> 17:42.397
<i>When they came for the girl, I hid them.</i>

17:42.508 --> 17:45.136
<i>Could've sold them, but I didn't.</i>

17:56.989 --> 18:00.015
<i>Those handles is chased silver,
ain't they?</i>

18:01.794 --> 18:04.058
Silver. Yes.

18:14.039 --> 18:17.167
<i>These are my friends</i>

18:18.777 --> 18:22.873
<i>See how they glisten</i>

18:23.816 --> 18:27.115
<i>See this one shine</i>

18:27.753 --> 18:32.486
<i>How he smiles in the light</i>

18:32.591 --> 18:35.890
<i>My friend</i>

18:35.995 --> 18:40.193
<i>My faithful friend</i>

18:42.735 --> 18:46.603
<i>Speak to me, friend</i>

18:47.673 --> 18:51.200
<i>Whisper, I'll listen</i>

18:52.178 --> 18:55.614
<i>I know, I know</i>

18:55.714 --> 19:02.381
<i>You've been locked
out of sight all these years</i>

19:03.022 --> 19:07.220
<i>Like me, my friend</i>

19:07.326 --> 19:11.422
<i>Well, I've come home</i>

19:11.530 --> 19:15.694
<i>To find you waiting</i>

19:17.002 --> 19:19.470
<i>Home</i>

19:19.572 --> 19:23.565
<i>And we're together</i>

19:24.410 --> 19:28.141
<i>And we'll do wonders</i>

19:30.282 --> 19:32.147
<i>Won't we?</i>

19:33.319 --> 19:36.083
<i>You there, my friend</i>

19:36.188 --> 19:40.090
<i>- I'm your friend, too, Mr. Todd
- Come, let me hold you</i>

19:40.192 --> 19:43.628
<i>- If you only knew, Mr. Todd
- Now, with a sigh</i>

19:43.729 --> 19:44.957
<i>Oh, Mr. Todd</i>

19:45.064 --> 19:48.727
<i>- you're warm in my hand
- You grow warm in my hand</i>

19:48.834 --> 19:50.802
<i>My friend</i>

19:50.903 --> 19:54.634
<i>- You've come home
- My clever friend</i>

19:54.740 --> 19:58.506
<i>Always had a fondness for you, I did</i>

19:58.611 --> 20:01.307
<i>Rest now, my friends</i>

20:01.413 --> 20:05.679
<i>- Never you fear, Mr. Todd
- Soon I'll unfold you</i>

20:05.784 --> 20:08.514
<i>- You can move in here, Mr. Todd
- Soon you'll know</i>

20:08.621 --> 20:11.784
<i>- Splendors you never
- Splendors you never</i>

20:11.890 --> 20:15.053
<i>- have dreamed all your days
- have dreamed all your days</i>

20:15.160 --> 20:16.752
<i>Will be yours</i>

20:16.862 --> 20:19.422
<i>My lucky friends</i>

20:19.531 --> 20:23.592
<i>- I'm your friend and now you're mine
- Till now your shine...</i>

20:23.702 --> 20:27.968
<i>- Don't they shine beautiful?
- ... was merely silver</i>

20:28.073 --> 20:30.564
<i>Silver's good enough for me</i>

20:30.676 --> 20:36.546
<i>- Friends, you shall drip rubies
- Mr. T</i>

20:38.017 --> 20:41.544
<i>You'll soon drip precious</i>

20:43.355 --> 20:46.188
<i>rubies</i>

20:53.899 --> 20:55.389
Leave me.

21:08.847 --> 21:13.580
<i>At last, my arm is complete again.</i>

22:14.947 --> 22:19.247
<i>Green finch and linnet bird
Nightingale, blackbird</i>

22:19.351 --> 22:22.548
<i>How is it you sing?</i>

22:23.589 --> 22:27.650
<i>How can you jubilate
Sitting in cages</i>

22:27.760 --> 22:30.820
<i>Never taking wing?</i>

22:31.930 --> 22:36.526
<i>Outside the sky waits
Beckoning, beckoning</i>

22:36.635 --> 22:39.365
<i>Just beyond the bars</i>

22:40.973 --> 22:44.136
<i>How can you remain
Staring at the rain</i>

22:44.243 --> 22:48.145
<i>Maddened by the stars?</i>

22:49.581 --> 22:53.779
<i>How is it you sing anything?</i>

22:54.486 --> 22:58.479
<i>How is it you sing?</i>

23:12.471 --> 23:16.532
<i>My cage has many rooms
Damask and dark</i>

23:16.642 --> 23:22.103
<i>Nothing there sings
Not even my lark</i>

23:22.214 --> 23:26.617
<i>Larks never will, you know
When they're captive</i>

23:26.718 --> 23:31.985
<i>Teach me to be more adaptive</i>

23:37.162 --> 23:41.622
<i>Green finch and linnet bird
Nightingale, blackbird</i>

23:41.733 --> 23:45.829
<i>Teach me how to sing</i>

23:45.938 --> 23:50.875
<i>If I cannot fly</i>

23:52.144 --> 23:58.777
<i>Let me sing</i>

24:10.195 --> 24:11.685
<i>Alms!</i>

24:11.830 --> 24:16.597
<i>Alms for a miserable woman</i>

24:18.437 --> 24:24.433
<i>On a miserable chilly morning</i>

24:26.578 --> 24:28.808
<i>- Thank you, sir!
- Ma'am?</i>

24:30.182 --> 24:32.946
Could you tell me whose house this is?

24:33.352 --> 24:36.344
<i>That's the great
Judge Turpin's house, that is.</i>

24:36.455 --> 24:38.821
And the young lady who resides there?

24:38.924 --> 24:42.917
<i>Oh, that's Johanna,
his pretty little ward.</i>

24:43.128 --> 24:46.461
<i>Keeps her snug, he does. All locked up.</i>

24:47.165 --> 24:51.898
<i>So don't you go trespassing there,
or it's a good whipping for you,</i>

24:52.004 --> 24:55.838
or any other young man
with mischief on his mind.

24:56.742 --> 24:58.209
<i>Alms!</i>

24:58.310 --> 25:03.373
<i>Alms for a desperate woman</i>

25:08.220 --> 25:12.316
<i>I feel you</i>

25:12.424 --> 25:16.360
<i>Johanna</i>

25:16.461 --> 25:20.795
<i>I feel you</i>

25:20.899 --> 25:24.801
<i>I was half convinced I'd waken</i>

25:24.903 --> 25:28.862
<i>Satisfied enough to dream you</i>

25:28.974 --> 25:35.072
<i>Happily I was mistaken, Johanna</i>

25:36.315 --> 25:40.308
<i>I'll steal you</i>

25:40.419 --> 25:44.219
<i>Johanna!</i>

25:44.323 --> 25:48.885
<i>I'll steal you</i>

26:03.475 --> 26:05.602
<i>Come in, lad. Come in.</i>

26:12.584 --> 26:15.018
<i>You were looking for Hyde Park,
you say?</i>

26:15.153 --> 26:16.415
Yes.

26:16.989 --> 26:20.481
<i>It's very large on the map,
but I keep getting lost.</i>

26:20.592 --> 26:22.651
<i>Sit down, lad, sit down.</i>

26:23.395 --> 26:28.059
<i>It's embarrassing for a sailor
to lose his bearings, but there you are.</i>

26:32.738 --> 26:34.205
A sailor?

26:35.674 --> 26:38.404
<i>Yes, sir. The Bountiful, out of Plymouth.</i>

26:38.543 --> 26:42.138
<i>A sailor must know
the ways of the world, yes?</i>

26:43.115 --> 26:46.573
Must be practiced
in the ways of the world.

26:46.685 --> 26:48.710
<i>Would you say you were practiced, boy?</i>

26:48.920 --> 26:52.185
<i>- Sir?
- Oh, yes.</i>

26:53.392 --> 26:56.725
Such practices.

26:58.397 --> 27:02.663
The geishas of Japan.
The concubines of Siam.

27:02.768 --> 27:07.228
The catamites of Greece.
The harlots of India.

27:08.840 --> 27:12.537
I have them all here. Drawings of them.

27:12.644 --> 27:18.173
Everything you've ever dreamed
of doing with a woman.

27:19.618 --> 27:21.483
Would you like to see?

27:22.587 --> 27:25.055
I think there's been some mistake.

27:25.924 --> 27:27.414
I think not.

27:29.661 --> 27:34.564
<i>You gandered at my ward, Johanna.
You gandered at her.</i>

27:34.666 --> 27:39.035
<i>- Yes, sir, you gandered.
- I meant no harm.</i>

27:39.137 --> 27:41.230
Your meaning is immaterial.

27:42.741 --> 27:44.208
Mark me.

27:44.309 --> 27:51.181
<i>If I see your face again on this street,
you'll rue the day you were born.</i>

27:55.353 --> 27:57.821
<i>Hyde Park is that way, young sir!</i>

27:57.923 --> 28:01.086
<i>A left and a right and straight on,
you see?</i>

28:01.193 --> 28:03.161
<i>Move on, now!</i>

28:11.570 --> 28:15.199
<i>You heard what Judge Turpin said,
little man.</i>

28:15.941 --> 28:20.901
<i>Next time, it'll be your pretty little brains
all over the pavement.</i>

28:45.237 --> 28:49.071
<i>I'll steal you</i>

28:49.174 --> 28:53.133
<i>Johanna</i>

28:53.245 --> 28:57.511
<i>I'll steal you</i>

28:57.616 --> 29:01.450
<i>Do they think that walls can hide you?</i>

29:01.553 --> 29:05.421
<i>Even now, I'm at your window</i>

29:05.524 --> 29:10.052
<i>I am in the dark beside you</i>

29:10.162 --> 29:15.190
<i>Buried sweetly in your yellow hair</i>

29:22.073 --> 29:25.600
<i>I feel you</i>

29:25.710 --> 29:29.544
<i>Johanna</i>

29:29.648 --> 29:33.516
<i>And one day</i>

29:33.618 --> 29:38.453
<i>I'll steal you</i>

29:38.557 --> 29:42.357
<i>Till I'm with you then
I'm with you there!</i>

29:42.460 --> 29:47.329
<i>Sweetly buried in your yellow hair!</i>

30:09.855 --> 30:13.382
He's here every Thursday.
Italian. All the rage he is.

30:14.259 --> 30:16.591
<i>Best barber in London, they say.</i>

30:48.059 --> 30:49.253
Hang on.

31:21.259 --> 31:25.389
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
May I have your attention, please?</i>

31:26.765 --> 31:28.733
<i>Do you wake every morning
in shame and despair</i>

31:28.833 --> 31:31.734
<i>To discover your pillow
is covered with hair</i>

31:31.836 --> 31:33.804
<i>What ought not to be there?</i>

31:33.905 --> 31:37.773
<i>Well, ladies and gentlemen
From now on you can waken at ease</i>

31:37.876 --> 31:39.741
<i>You need never again
have a worry or care</i>

31:39.844 --> 31:42.574
<i>I will show you a miracle
marvelous rare</i>

31:43.581 --> 31:45.378
<i>Gentlemen, you are about
to see something</i>

31:45.483 --> 31:48.384
<i>What rose from the dead!</i>

31:49.254 --> 31:51.279
<i>On the top of my head!</i>

31:53.792 --> 31:57.250
<i>'Twas Pirelli's Miracle Elixir</i>

31:57.362 --> 32:00.798
<i>That's what did the trick, sir
True, sir, true</i>

32:00.899 --> 32:04.426
<i>Was it quick, sir? Did it in a tick, sir?</i>

32:04.536 --> 32:08.131
<i>Just like an elixir ought to do</i>

32:08.239 --> 32:12.608
<i>How about a bottle, mister?
Only costs a penny, guaranteed</i>

32:15.280 --> 32:18.841
<i>Does Pirelli's stimulate the growth, sir?</i>

32:18.950 --> 32:22.283
<i>You can have my oath, sir
'Tis unique</i>

32:22.387 --> 32:25.845
<i>Rub a minute
Stimulating, isn't it?</i>

32:25.957 --> 32:29.688
<i>Soon you'll have to thin it
Once a week!</i>

32:29.794 --> 32:31.455
<i>Pardon me, ma'am
what's that awful stench?</i>

32:31.563 --> 32:33.190
<i>Are we standing in an open trench?</i>

32:33.298 --> 32:34.265
<i>Must be standing near an open trench!</i>

32:34.366 --> 32:35.355
<i>Pardon me, sir
what's that awful stench?</i>

32:35.467 --> 32:38.368
<i>Buy Pirelli's Miracle Elixir</i>

32:38.470 --> 32:42.031
<i>Anything what's slick, sir
Soon sprouts curls</i>

32:42.140 --> 32:45.541
<i>Try Pirelli's
When they see how thick, sir</i>

32:45.643 --> 32:49.238
<i>You can have your pick, sir
Of the girls</i>

32:49.347 --> 32:50.507
<i>Want to buy a bottle, missus?</i>

32:50.615 --> 32:52.139
<i>- What is this?
- What is this?</i>

32:52.250 --> 32:54.775
<i>- Smells like piss
- Smells like...</i>

32:54.886 --> 32:56.683
<i>- Looks like piss!
- Wouldn't touch it if I was you, dear!</i>

32:56.788 --> 33:00.224
<i>- This is piss, piss with ink
- Let Pirelli's activate your roots, sir!</i>

33:00.325 --> 33:01.849
<i>Keep it off your boots, sir
Eats right through</i>

33:01.960 --> 33:04.793
<i>Yes, get Pirelli's, use a bottle of it
Ladies seem to love it</i>

33:04.896 --> 33:06.796
<i>Flies do, too</i>

33:09.634 --> 33:11.499
<i>I am Adolfo Pirelli</i>

33:11.603 --> 33:13.662
<i>The king of the barbers
The barber of kings</i>

33:13.772 --> 33:17.037
<i>E buon giorno, good day!
I blow you a kiss!</i>

33:17.642 --> 33:19.473
<i>And I</i>

33:19.577 --> 33:21.772
<i>the so famous Pirelli
I wish-a to know-a</i>

33:21.880 --> 33:24.747
<i>Who has-a the nerve-a to say</i>

33:24.849 --> 33:27.010
<i>My elixir is piss</i>

33:27.986 --> 33:30.181
<i>Who says this?</i>

33:32.724 --> 33:33.952
I do.

33:36.061 --> 33:38.825
I am Mr. Sweeney Todd of Fleet Street.

33:40.031 --> 33:42.397
I have opened a bottle of Pirelli's Elixir.

33:42.500 --> 33:46.459
<i>And I say to you that it is nothing
but an arrant fraud,</i>

33:47.405 --> 33:50.203
concocted from piss and ink.

33:51.242 --> 33:55.008
<i>Furthermore, Signor,
I have serviced no kings,</i>

33:56.214 --> 34:00.981
<i>yet I wager that I can shave a cheek
with 10 times more dexterity,</i>

34:01.086 --> 34:03.421
than any street mountebank.

34:08.359 --> 34:10.327
Do you see these razors?

34:11.228 --> 34:13.789
I lay them against £5.

34:14.632 --> 34:16.623
<i>You are no match, sir.</i>

34:17.335 --> 34:22.034
<i>Either accept my challenge,
or reveal yourself as a sham.</i>

34:24.074 --> 34:26.168
You hear this foolish man?

34:26.844 --> 34:32.181
<i>Now, please, you will see
how he will-a regret-a his-a folly.</i>

34:33.184 --> 34:34.650
Toby!

34:34.752 --> 34:36.686
Who's for a free shave?

34:59.511 --> 35:01.638
Will Beadle Bamford be the judge?

35:01.779 --> 35:06.443
<i>Glad, as always,
to oblige my friends and neighbors.</i>

35:17.929 --> 35:19.123
Ready?

35:19.797 --> 35:21.025
Ready!

35:21.633 --> 35:22.895
Ready.

35:23.535 --> 35:27.995
<i>The fastest,
smoothest shave is the winner!</i>

35:52.730 --> 35:55.426
<i>Now, signorini, signori
We mix-a the lather</i>

35:55.533 --> 35:58.434
<i>But first-a
You gather around, signorini, signori</i>

35:58.536 --> 36:01.562
<i>You looking a man who have
had-a the glory to shave-a the Pope!</i>

36:01.673 --> 36:03.868
<i>Mr. Sweeney, whoever
I beg-a you pardon</i>

36:03.975 --> 36:06.375
<i>You'll probably say
it was only a cardinal</i>

36:06.477 --> 36:07.842
<i>Nope!</i>

36:07.946 --> 36:09.777
<i>It was-a the Pope!</i>

36:12.150 --> 36:16.985
<i>To shave-a the face
To cut-a the hair</i>

36:17.088 --> 36:22.116
<i>Require the grace
Require the flair</i>

36:22.227 --> 36:24.718
<i>For if-a you slip
You nick the skin</i>

36:24.829 --> 36:27.423
<i>You clip-a the chin
You rip-a the lip a bit</i>

36:27.532 --> 36:29.830
<i>Beyond-a repair</i>

36:30.435 --> 36:32.562
<i>To shave-a the face</i>

36:33.371 --> 36:37.137
<i>Or even a part
Without it-a smart</i>

36:37.875 --> 36:40.742
<i>Require the heart</i>

36:40.845 --> 36:43.336
<i>Not just-a the flash</i>

36:43.448 --> 36:48.977
<i>It take-a panache
It take-a the passion for the art</i>

36:50.888 --> 36:55.348
<i>To shave-a the face
To trim-a the beard</i>

36:55.994 --> 37:00.226
<i>To make-a the bristle
Clean like a whistle</i>

37:00.331 --> 37:06.270
<i>This is from early infancy
The talent give to me</i>

37:06.537 --> 37:09.563
<i>By God</i>

37:12.777 --> 37:16.770
<i>It take-a the skill
It take-a the brains</i>

37:17.282 --> 37:22.948
<i>It take-a da will
To take-a the pains</i>

37:23.721 --> 37:28.886
<i>It take-a the pace
It take-a the grace</i>

37:38.036 --> 37:40.834
The winner is Todd!

37:52.350 --> 37:56.252
<i>Sir, I bow to a skill
far greater than my own.</i>

37:57.622 --> 37:59.180
The £5.

38:05.663 --> 38:08.131
May the good Lord smile on you.

38:09.634 --> 38:11.499
Until we meet again.

38:12.270 --> 38:14.170
<i>Come, boy. Come!</i>

38:23.681 --> 38:25.308
<i>Suppose it's just me gentle heart,</i>

38:25.416 --> 38:28.510
but I do hate to see a boy
treated like that.

38:28.619 --> 38:31.087
<i>Congratulations, Mr. Todd.</i>

38:31.189 --> 38:34.022
<i>May I ask you, sir,
do you have your own establishment?</i>

38:34.125 --> 38:35.683
He certainly does.

38:35.793 --> 38:38.125
<i>Sweeney Todd's Tonsorial Parlor,</i>

38:38.229 --> 38:41.289
above my Meat Pie Emporium
in Fleet Street.

38:44.969 --> 38:47.028
<i>I thank you, sir.</i>

38:47.138 --> 38:49.902
You are a paragon of integrity.

38:50.007 --> 38:54.171
<i>Well, I try to do my best for
my friends and neighbors.</i>

38:55.012 --> 38:58.413
<i>Your establishment
is in Fleet Street, you say?</i>

38:58.683 --> 39:01.117
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Then, Mr. Todd,</i>

39:01.619 --> 39:05.680
you shall surely see me there
before the week is out.

39:05.990 --> 39:08.481
<i>You will be welcome, Beadle Bamford.</i>

39:08.593 --> 39:12.825
<i>And I can guarantee to give you,
without a penny's charge,</i>

39:12.930 --> 39:15.558
the closest shave you will ever know.

39:26.177 --> 39:27.804
<i>Come on, love.</i>

40:47.458 --> 40:49.756
<i>It's not much of a chair, but it'll do.</i>

40:49.861 --> 40:53.024
<i>It was me poor Albert's chair.
Sit in it all day long he did,</i>

40:53.130 --> 40:55.394
after his leg gave out with the gout.

40:55.500 --> 40:57.434
Why doesn't the Beadle come?

40:57.535 --> 41:00.732
<i>"Before the week is out,"
that's what he said.</i>

41:00.838 --> 41:04.137
<i>Well, who says the week's out?
It's only Tuesday.</i>

41:08.246 --> 41:12.910
<i>Easy now
Hush, love, hush</i>

41:13.017 --> 41:17.317
<i>Don't distress yourself
What's your rush?</i>

41:17.421 --> 41:21.653
<i>Keep your thoughts
Nice and lush</i>

41:21.759 --> 41:23.351
<i>Wait</i>

41:26.230 --> 41:30.496
<i>Hush, love, hush
Think it through</i>

41:30.601 --> 41:34.628
<i>Once it bubbles
Then what's to do?</i>

41:34.739 --> 41:38.937
<i>Watch it close
Let it brew</i>

41:39.043 --> 41:40.305
<i>Wait</i>

41:42.146 --> 41:46.845
<i>I've been thinking flowers
Maybe daisies</i>

41:46.951 --> 41:49.010
<i>To brighten up the room</i>

41:50.388 --> 41:55.189
<i>Don't you think some flowers
Pretty daisies</i>

41:55.293 --> 41:57.818
<i>Might relieve the gloom?</i>

41:59.630 --> 42:00.927
<i>Wait</i>

42:02.800 --> 42:05.234
<i>Love, wait</i>

42:05.336 --> 42:08.100
And the Judge? When'll we get to him?

42:09.240 --> 42:12.705
Can't you think of nothing else?
Always brooding away on your wrongs

42:12.810 --> 42:15.745
and what happened
heaven knows how many years ago.

42:15.846 --> 42:17.336
Come on.

42:17.448 --> 42:21.179
<i>Slow, love, slow
Time's so fast</i>

42:21.786 --> 42:26.052
<i>Now goes quickly
See, now it's past</i>

42:26.157 --> 42:30.116
<i>Soon will come
Soon will last</i>

42:30.227 --> 42:31.592
<i>Wait</i>

42:34.665 --> 42:38.761
<i>Don't you know
Silly man</i>

42:38.869 --> 42:42.396
<i>Half the fun is to plan the plan?</i>

42:43.107 --> 42:47.168
<i>All good things
come to those who can</i>

42:47.278 --> 42:48.506
<i>Wait</i>

42:51.716 --> 42:56.380
<i>Gillyflowers, maybe
'Stead of daisies</i>

42:56.587 --> 43:01.047
<i>I don't know, though
What do you think?</i>

43:10.968 --> 43:12.629
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, excuse me.</i>

43:12.737 --> 43:15.399
<i>- Mrs. Lovett, sir.
- A pleasure, ma'am.</i>

43:16.273 --> 43:18.332
<i>Mr. Todd,
there's a girl who needs my help.</i>

43:18.442 --> 43:20.467
<i>Such a sad girl and lonely,
but beautiful, too and...</i>

43:20.578 --> 43:24.139
<i>- Slow down, son.
- Yes. I'm sorry.</i>

43:25.583 --> 43:27.517
<i>This girl has a guardian
who keeps her locked away,</i>

43:27.618 --> 43:29.677
<i>but then, this morning,
she dropped this.</i>

43:29.787 --> 43:32.051
Surely a sign
that Johanna wants me to help her.

43:32.156 --> 43:33.714
<i>That's her name, Johanna.</i>

43:33.824 --> 43:37.055
And Turpin is her guardian.
He's a judge of some sort.

43:37.161 --> 43:39.095
<i>Once he goes to court,
I'm going to slip into the house,</i>

43:39.196 --> 43:41.562
release her and beg her
to come away with me tonight.

43:41.666 --> 43:44.066
<i>- Oh, this is very romantic.
- Yes.</i>

43:45.102 --> 43:47.161
<i>But I don't know anyone in London,
you see.</i>

43:47.271 --> 43:51.264
And I need somewhere safe to bring her
till I've hired a coach to take us away.

43:51.375 --> 43:53.400
<i>If I could keep her here
just for an hour or two,</i>

43:53.511 --> 43:55.741
I'd be forever in your debt.

43:59.517 --> 44:02.953
<i>- Bring her here, love.
- Thank you, ma'am.</i>

44:03.921 --> 44:05.286
Mr. Todd?

44:07.191 --> 44:09.386
<i>Oh, thank you.
Thank you, thank you, my friend.</i>

44:09.493 --> 44:11.188
<i>Thank you, ma'am.</i>

44:14.298 --> 44:17.790
<i>Seems like the Fates
are favoring you at last, Mr. T.</i>

44:19.236 --> 44:22.728
What is it? You'll have her back
before the day is out.

44:23.507 --> 44:24.804
What about him?

44:25.776 --> 44:26.936
Him?

44:27.044 --> 44:29.638
<i>Oh, well. Let him bring her here.</i>

44:29.747 --> 44:32.648
<i>And then, since you're so hot for a little,</i>

44:33.884 --> 44:36.409
<i>that's the throat to slit, my dear.</i>

44:38.189 --> 44:39.952
Poor little Johanna.

44:40.057 --> 44:43.493
All those years without a scrap
of motherly affection.

44:43.994 --> 44:47.088
<i>Well, I'll soon see to that.</i>

44:55.306 --> 44:58.605
Hello. What's he doing here?

45:00.611 --> 45:02.875
Keep the boy downstairs.

45:14.191 --> 45:16.625
<i>Signora, is Mr. Todd at home?</i>

45:16.727 --> 45:18.854
Plying his trade upstairs.

45:19.930 --> 45:21.591
Would you look at it now?

45:21.699 --> 45:24.190
<i>You wouldn't mind if I gave it a nice
juicy meat pie, would you?</i>

45:24.301 --> 45:28.101
<i>- Sì, sì, sì. Whatever you want.
- Come on, lad.</i>

45:28.572 --> 45:30.972
<i>Your teeth are strong, I hope.</i>

45:32.510 --> 45:36.071
Close the door.
Get you a nice lovely pie.

45:38.916 --> 45:41.248
Sit down. Make yourself comfy.

45:48.726 --> 45:50.159
Come in.

45:59.036 --> 46:01.732
- Mr. Todd.
- Signor Pirelli.

46:03.340 --> 46:04.830
Call me Davey.

46:05.876 --> 46:09.243
Davey Collin's the name
when it's not professional.

46:10.481 --> 46:12.915
<i>I'd like me five quid back,
if you don't mind.</i>

46:13.017 --> 46:14.109
Why?

46:14.218 --> 46:18.245
<i>Because you entered into our little
wager under false pretenses, my friend.</i>

46:18.355 --> 46:22.985
<i>So that you might remember
to be a bit more forthright in the future,</i>

46:23.093 --> 46:25.027
I'll be taking half your profits
from herewith.

46:25.129 --> 46:27.063
Share and share alike.

46:28.599 --> 46:30.999
Mr. Benjamin Barker.

46:33.537 --> 46:36.597
Here we are. Tuck in.

46:40.211 --> 46:43.146
I like to see a man
with a healthy appetite.

46:43.247 --> 46:45.545
Reminds me of my dear Albert.

46:46.150 --> 46:49.745
<i>Liked to gorge himself
to bloatation, he did.</i>

46:49.854 --> 46:52.152
<i>He didn't have
your nice head of hair, though.</i>

46:52.256 --> 46:55.487
<i>To tell the truth, it gets awful hot.</i>

46:59.663 --> 47:01.824
<i>Yes, this'll do nicely.</i>

47:05.469 --> 47:08.802
<i>You don't remember me, do you?
Why should you?</i>

47:08.906 --> 47:11.238
<i>I was just a little nip
that you hired for a couple of weeks,</i>

47:11.342 --> 47:13.310
sweeping up hair.

47:14.245 --> 47:16.304
But I remember these.

47:17.147 --> 47:20.173
<i>And how could
I ever forget you, Mr. Barker.</i>

47:24.488 --> 47:26.649
I used to sit right here.

47:27.591 --> 47:30.458
Dream of the day
when I could be a proper barber myself.

47:30.561 --> 47:34.292
You might say that you was
inspiration to me.

47:46.644 --> 47:48.509
<i>So, is we got a deal?</i>

47:49.914 --> 47:53.941
<i>Or should I run down the street
to me old pal, Beadle Bamford?</i>

47:57.554 --> 48:01.752
<i>What do you say to that, now,
Mr. Sweeney Todd?</i>

48:24.415 --> 48:27.441
<i>My, my, my. Always work to be done.</i>

48:27.551 --> 48:29.883
<i>Spic and span, that's my motto.</i>

48:42.566 --> 48:45.933
<i>So, how'd you end up
with that dreadful Italian?</i>

48:46.036 --> 48:50.405
Got me from the workhouse.
Been there since I was born.

48:50.507 --> 48:53.101
<i>Oh, God!
He's got an appointment with his tailor!</i>

48:53.210 --> 48:54.802
<i>If he's late, he'll blame me!</i>

48:54.912 --> 48:56.174
Wait!

49:02.820 --> 49:05.345
Signor! You got an appointment!

49:10.594 --> 49:14.394
Signor Pirelli's been called away.
Better run after him.

49:15.366 --> 49:19.803
<i>No, sir. I should stay here,
or it'll be a lashing.</i>

49:19.903 --> 49:22.599
He's a great one for the lashings.

49:28.479 --> 49:29.639
<i>So,</i>

49:30.948 --> 49:34.884
<i>- Mrs. Lovett gave you a pie, did she?
- She's a real lady.</i>

49:35.753 --> 49:37.380
That she is.

49:42.259 --> 49:47.253
<i>But if I know a growing boy,
there's still room for more pie, eh?</i>

49:47.364 --> 49:48.661
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

49:49.933 --> 49:52.731
Then why don't you wait
for your master downstairs?

49:52.836 --> 49:57.205
<i>- Be another pie in it for you, I'm sure.
- No, I should stay here.</i>

49:59.943 --> 50:03.879
<i>Tell you what,
why don't you tell Mrs. Lovett</i>

50:03.981 --> 50:07.439
that I said to give you
a nice big tot of gin.

50:07.551 --> 50:09.109
<i>Thank you, sir!</i>

51:17.121 --> 51:19.419
<i>This is the second time, sir,</i>

51:19.523 --> 51:22.651
you have been brought
before this bench.

51:23.894 --> 51:27.990
<i>Though it is my earnest wish ever
to temper justice with mercy,</i>

51:28.098 --> 51:31.261
your persistent dedication
to a life of crime

51:31.368 --> 51:35.031
is an abomination before God and man.

51:35.139 --> 51:38.597
I therefore sentence you
to hang by the neck until you're dead.

51:38.709 --> 51:41.678
And may the Lord
have mercy on your soul.

51:42.746 --> 51:44.509
Court is adjourned.

51:53.490 --> 51:55.981
<i>Thank you, Your Honor.</i>

51:56.093 --> 51:59.529
- Just the sentence we wanted.
- Was he guilty?

51:59.630 --> 52:00.756
<i>Well, if he didn't do it,</i>

52:00.864 --> 52:03.298
he's surely done
something to warrant a hanging.

52:03.400 --> 52:06.096
- What man has not?
- Sorry?

52:09.106 --> 52:10.869
No matter. Come.

52:12.075 --> 52:13.736
Walk home with me.

52:16.780 --> 52:19.476
<i>I have news for you, my friend.</i>

52:19.583 --> 52:22.609
<i>In order to shield her
from the evils of this world,</i>

52:22.719 --> 52:26.052
I have decided to marry
my dear Johanna.

52:26.156 --> 52:28.556
<i>Sir, happy news indeed.</i>

52:28.659 --> 52:30.217
<i>Strange though,</i>

52:30.827 --> 52:36.493
<i>when I offered myself to her,
she showed a certain reluctance.</i>

52:37.401 --> 52:40.097
<i>Excuse me, my lord
May I request, my lord</i>

52:40.204 --> 52:42.604
<i>Permission, my lord, to speak?</i>

52:42.706 --> 52:44.970
<i>Forgive me if I suggest, my lord</i>

52:45.075 --> 52:47.441
<i>You're looking less
than your best, my lord</i>

52:47.544 --> 52:52.243
<i>There's powder upon your vest, my lord
And stubble upon your cheek</i>

52:55.385 --> 52:59.287
<i>And ladies, my lord, are weak</i>

53:00.090 --> 53:02.354
<i>Stubble, you say?</i>

53:05.696 --> 53:09.154
Perhaps I am
a little overhasty in the mornings.

53:10.267 --> 53:12.735
<i>Fret not though, my lord
I know a place, my lord</i>

53:12.836 --> 53:15.361
<i>A barber, my lord, of skill</i>

53:15.472 --> 53:17.667
<i>Thus armed with a shaven face, my lord</i>

53:17.774 --> 53:20.072
<i>Some eau de cologne to grace, my lord</i>

53:20.177 --> 53:22.645
<i>And musk to enhance the chase
my lord</i>

53:22.746 --> 53:25.613
<i>You'll dazzle the girl until</i>

53:26.516 --> 53:27.881
Until?

53:28.452 --> 53:32.650
<i>She bows to your every will</i>

53:33.724 --> 53:35.021
Barber?

53:36.326 --> 53:37.350
Take me to him.

53:37.461 --> 53:42.160
<i>His name is Todd, my lord, and he is
the very last word in barbering.</i>

53:48.839 --> 53:52.275
<i>You ought to slow down a bit, lad.
It'll go straight to your head.</i>

53:52.376 --> 53:53.968
They used to give it to us
in the workhouse

53:54.077 --> 53:55.840
so as we could sleep.

53:55.946 --> 53:58.107
<i>Not that you'd want
to sleep in that place, ma'am.</i>

53:58.215 --> 54:00.581
Not with the things
what happen in the dark.

54:00.684 --> 54:02.015
<i>That's nice, dear.</i>

54:02.119 --> 54:03.950
Think I'll just pop in
on Mr. Todd for a tick.

54:04.054 --> 54:06.887
<i>- You all right, there?
- Leave the bottle.</i>

54:11.895 --> 54:15.296
That lad is drinking me
out of house and home.

54:16.300 --> 54:18.632
How long till Pirelli gets back?

54:19.269 --> 54:20.998
He won't be back.

54:22.873 --> 54:24.738
<i>Mr. T, you didn't.</i>

54:35.952 --> 54:39.547
You're barking mad.
Killing a man what done you no harm.

54:40.390 --> 54:44.326
He recognized me from the old days.
Tried to blackmail me.

54:45.595 --> 54:47.222
Half me earnings.

54:47.931 --> 54:50.729
<i>Oh, well, it's a different matter then.</i>

54:51.635 --> 54:55.127
<i>For a moment there,
I thought you'd lost your marbles.</i>

54:58.208 --> 54:59.835
All that blood.

55:01.345 --> 55:02.812
Poor bugger.

55:03.680 --> 55:05.045
<i>Oh, well.</i>

55:13.457 --> 55:15.857
<i>Well, waste not, want not.</i>

55:17.494 --> 55:20.759
<i>So, what are we gonna do
about the boy then?</i>

55:22.265 --> 55:23.789
Send him up.

55:24.735 --> 55:27.704
<i>Oh, we don't need to worry about him.
He's a simple thing.</i>

55:27.804 --> 55:29.328
Send him up!

55:32.242 --> 55:35.700
<i>Now, Mr. T,
surely one's enough for today.</i>

55:36.847 --> 55:40.339
<i>Besides, I was thinking of hiring the lad
to help me run the shop.</i>

55:40.450 --> 55:43.419
Your poor knees
aren't what they used to be.

55:44.221 --> 55:45.654
All right.

55:47.691 --> 55:49.989
<i>Course, we're gonna
have to stock up on the gin.</i>

55:50.093 --> 55:52.118
Boy drinks like a sailor.

55:56.266 --> 55:57.563
The Judge.

56:01.071 --> 56:02.333
Get out.

56:04.408 --> 56:05.670
Get out!

56:22.058 --> 56:23.548
Mr. Todd?

56:24.594 --> 56:26.221
At your service.

56:27.397 --> 56:30.525
<i>An honor to receive
your patronage, my lord.</i>

56:31.802 --> 56:33.497
<i>You know me, sir?</i>

56:33.904 --> 56:39.137
Who in this wide world
does not know the great Judge Turpin?

56:45.749 --> 56:47.649
<i>These premises
are hardly prepossessing,</i>

56:47.751 --> 56:49.582
and yet the Beadle tells me

56:49.686 --> 56:53.588
you're the most accomplished
of all the barbers in the city.

56:54.257 --> 56:56.623
<i>That is gracious of him, sir.</i>

56:57.694 --> 57:00.128
<i>What may I do for you today, sir?</i>

57:00.897 --> 57:03.695
A stylish trimming of the hair?

57:03.800 --> 57:05.791
Soothing skin massage?

57:05.902 --> 57:07.631
<i>Sit, sir. Sit.</i>

57:08.805 --> 57:13.765
<i>You see, sir, a man infatuate with love
Her ardent and eager slave</i>

57:13.877 --> 57:18.780
<i>So fetch the pomade and pumice stone
And lend me a more seductive tone</i>

57:18.882 --> 57:23.319
<i>A sprinkling perhaps of French cologne
But first, sir, I think</i>

57:24.387 --> 57:26.981
<i>a shave</i>

57:28.758 --> 57:31.852
<i>The closest I ever gave</i>

57:36.500 --> 57:38.798
<i>You're in a merry mood today, Mr. Todd.</i>

57:38.902 --> 57:44.067
<i>'Tis your delight, sir, catching fire
From one man to the next</i>

57:44.174 --> 57:46.734
<i>'Tis true, sir, love can still inspire</i>

57:46.843 --> 57:49.243
<i>The blood to pound
the heart leap higher</i>

57:49.346 --> 57:50.711
<i>- What more
- What more</i>

57:50.814 --> 57:52.975
<i>- can man require than love, sir
- can man require</i>

57:53.083 --> 57:54.277
<i>More than love, sir</i>

57:54.384 --> 57:55.681
<i>- What, sir?
- Women</i>

57:55.785 --> 57:58.219
<i>- Yes, women
- Pretty women</i>

58:29.419 --> 58:33.583
<i>Now then, my friend</i>

58:34.691 --> 58:38.559
<i>Now to your purpose</i>

58:39.563 --> 58:43.294
<i>Patience, enjoy it</i>

58:44.167 --> 58:48.604
<i>Revenge can't be taken in haste</i>

58:48.705 --> 58:50.900
<i>Make haste, and if we wed
You'll be commended, sir</i>

58:51.007 --> 58:52.372
<i>My lord</i>

58:54.978 --> 58:57.412
<i>And who, may it be said
Is your intended, sir?</i>

58:57.514 --> 59:00.005
<i>My ward</i>

59:01.251 --> 59:03.583
A pretty little rosebud.

59:03.687 --> 59:05.587
Pretty as her mother?

59:06.623 --> 59:09.217
What? What was that?

59:09.326 --> 59:13.626
<i>Nothing, sir. Nothing. May we proceed?</i>

59:15.365 --> 59:16.957
<i>Pretty women</i>

59:17.567 --> 59:21.936
<i>Fascinating
Sipping coffee</i>

59:22.806 --> 59:27.937
<i>Dancing
Pretty women!</i>

59:28.044 --> 59:30.410
<i>Are a wonder</i>

59:30.513 --> 59:32.981
<i>Pretty women</i>

59:35.785 --> 59:40.654
<i>Sitting in the window or</i>

59:40.757 --> 59:45.660
<i>Standing on the stair</i>

59:45.762 --> 59:52.361
<i>Something in them
Cheers the air</i>

59:56.039 --> 59:57.836
<i>Pretty women</i>

59:58.842 --> 01:00:00.673
<i>Silhouetted</i>

01:00:01.311 --> 01:00:03.711
<i>Stay within you</i>

01:00:03.813 --> 01:00:06.338
<i>Glancing!</i>

01:00:06.449 --> 01:00:08.713
<i>Stay forever</i>

01:00:08.818 --> 01:00:11.446
<i>Breathing lightly</i>

01:00:11.554 --> 01:00:13.647
<i>Pretty women</i>

01:00:13.757 --> 01:00:16.157
<i>- Pretty women
- Pretty women</i>

01:00:16.259 --> 01:00:21.026
<i>- Blowing out their candles or
- Blowing out their candles or</i>

01:00:21.131 --> 01:00:24.396
<i>- Combing out their hair
- Combing out their hair</i>

01:00:24.501 --> 01:00:26.025
<i>Then they leave</i>

01:00:26.136 --> 01:00:28.036
<i>- Even when they leave...
- Even when they</i>

01:00:28.138 --> 01:00:29.662
<i>leave you and vanish...</i>

01:00:29.773 --> 01:00:32.674
<i>- ... they still...
- ... they somehow can still remain...</i>

01:00:32.776 --> 01:00:38.237
<i>- ... are there, they're there
- ... there with you</i>

01:00:38.348 --> 01:00:39.372
<i>- Pretty women
- Pretty women</i>

01:00:39.482 --> 01:00:41.006
<i>- At their mirrors
- In their gardens</i>

01:00:41.117 --> 01:00:42.641
<i>- Letter-writing
- Flower-picking</i>

01:00:42.752 --> 01:00:43.776
<i>weather-watching</i>

01:00:43.887 --> 01:00:48.688
<i>- How they make a man sing
- How they make a man sing</i>

01:00:48.792 --> 01:00:51.317
<i>- Proof of heaven
- Proof of heaven</i>

01:00:51.428 --> 01:00:53.760
<i>- As you're living
- As you're living</i>

01:00:53.863 --> 01:00:56.263
<i>- Pretty women, sir!
- Pretty women, sir!</i>

01:00:56.366 --> 01:00:58.459
<i>- Pretty women, yes!
- Pretty women, yes!</i>

01:00:58.568 --> 01:01:01.969
<i>- Pretty women, sir
- Pretty women, pretty women</i>

01:01:02.072 --> 01:01:03.664
Mr. Todd! I've seen Johanna

01:01:03.773 --> 01:01:06.503
and she said
she'd leave with me tonight.

01:01:08.778 --> 01:01:10.177
You.

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:14.478
There is indeed a higher power
to warn me thus in time.

01:01:14.584 --> 01:01:16.484
Johanna elope with you?

01:01:18.254 --> 01:01:19.380
I'll make sure that neither you

01:01:19.489 --> 01:01:22.788
nor any other man
shall ever set eyes on her again.

01:01:23.493 --> 01:01:24.960
<i>As for you, barber,</i>

01:01:25.061 --> 01:01:27.495
it's all too clear
what company you keep.

01:01:27.597 --> 01:01:29.690
<i>Service them well
and hold their custom,</i>

01:01:29.799 --> 01:01:31.596
for you'll have none of mine.

01:01:31.701 --> 01:01:33.931
- Mr. Todd. You have to help me.
- Out.

01:01:34.037 --> 01:01:35.436
<i>- Mr. Todd, please.
- Out.</i>

01:01:35.538 --> 01:01:37.472
- Mr. Todd!
- Out!

01:01:43.146 --> 01:01:44.443
All this shouting and running about.

01:01:44.547 --> 01:01:46.708
- What's happened?
- I had him.

01:01:46.816 --> 01:01:48.010
<i>The sailor busted in, I know.</i>

01:01:48.118 --> 01:01:49.551
And then I saw them both
running down the stairs.

01:01:49.652 --> 01:01:51.119
I had him!

01:01:51.221 --> 01:01:53.280
<i>His throat was bare beneath my hand</i>

01:01:53.389 --> 01:01:56.290
<i>- There, there, dear. Calm down.
- No, I had him!</i>

01:01:56.392 --> 01:01:58.826
<i>His throat was there
And he'll never come again!</i>

01:01:58.928 --> 01:02:01.863
<i>Easy now. Hush, love, hush</i>

01:02:01.965 --> 01:02:03.990
<i>- I'll keep telling you
- When?</i>

01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:06.193
<i>- What's your rush?
- Why did I wait?</i>

01:02:06.302 --> 01:02:10.204
<i>You told me to wait!
Now he'll never come again!</i>

01:02:12.742 --> 01:02:14.642
<i>There's a hole in the world
like a great black pit</i>

01:02:14.744 --> 01:02:16.644
<i>And it's filled with people
who are filled with shit</i>

01:02:16.746 --> 01:02:19.909
<i>And the vermin of the world inhabit it</i>

01:02:20.016 --> 01:02:22.541
<i>But not for long!</i>

01:02:25.655 --> 01:02:29.887
<i>They all deserve to die</i>

01:02:29.993 --> 01:02:34.396
<i>Tell you why, Mrs. Lovett
Tell you why</i>

01:02:34.497 --> 01:02:37.261
<i>Because in all of
the whole human race, Mrs. Lovett</i>

01:02:37.367 --> 01:02:39.699
<i>There are two kinds of men
and only two</i>

01:02:39.803 --> 01:02:41.896
<i>There's the one staying put
In his proper place</i>

01:02:42.005 --> 01:02:44.303
<i>And the one with his foot
In the other one's face</i>

01:02:44.407 --> 01:02:46.568
<i>Look at me, Mrs. Lovett, look at you!</i>

01:02:46.676 --> 01:02:51.010
<i>No, we all deserve to die</i>

01:02:51.114 --> 01:02:55.551
<i>Even you, Mrs. Lovett
Even I</i>

01:02:55.652 --> 01:02:58.382
<i>Because the lives of the wicked
should be made brief</i>

01:02:58.488 --> 01:03:00.683
<i>For the rest of us, death will be a relief</i>

01:03:00.790 --> 01:03:05.090
<i>We all deserve to die</i>

01:03:05.195 --> 01:03:11.327
<i>And I'll never see Johanna</i>

01:03:11.434 --> 01:03:17.566
<i>No, I'll never hug my girl to me</i>

01:03:17.674 --> 01:03:19.403
<i>Finished!</i>

01:03:20.777 --> 01:03:24.474
<i>All right! You, sir. How about a shave?</i>

01:03:24.581 --> 01:03:28.347
Come and visit
your good friend Sweeney.

01:03:28.451 --> 01:03:31.284
<i>You, sir, too, sir.
Welcome to the grave!</i>

01:03:31.387 --> 01:03:35.380
<i>I will have vengeance</i>

01:03:35.491 --> 01:03:40.622
<i>I will have salvation</i>

01:03:42.565 --> 01:03:43.554
<i>Who, sir?</i>

01:03:43.666 --> 01:03:46.328
<i>You, sir? No one's in the chair.
Come on, come on.</i>

01:03:46.436 --> 01:03:49.997
Sweeney's waiting! I want you bleeders.

01:03:50.106 --> 01:03:53.405
<i>You, sir! Anybody!
Gentlemen, now don't be shy!</i>

01:03:53.509 --> 01:03:59.175
<i>Not one man, no, nor ten men</i>

01:03:59.282 --> 01:04:05.710
<i>Nor a hundred can assuage me</i>

01:04:05.822 --> 01:04:09.724
<i>I will have you</i>

01:04:10.293 --> 01:04:13.820
<i>And I will get him back
Even as he gloats</i>

01:04:13.930 --> 01:04:17.229
<i>In the meantime
I'll practice on less honorable throats</i>

01:04:17.333 --> 01:04:23.602
<i>And my Lucy lies in ashes</i>

01:04:23.706 --> 01:04:30.339
<i>And I'll never see my girl again</i>

01:04:30.446 --> 01:04:33.938
<i>But the work waits!</i>

01:04:35.151 --> 01:04:38.086
<i>I'm alive at last!</i>

01:04:38.621 --> 01:04:44.719
<i>And I'm full of joy!</i>

01:04:51.401 --> 01:04:53.164
<i>That's all very well,
but what are we gonna do about him?</i>

01:04:58.737 --> 01:04:59.999
Hello?

01:05:03.575 --> 01:05:05.133
Do you hear me?

01:05:08.246 --> 01:05:09.736
Come on.

01:05:10.515 --> 01:05:12.710
You great useless thing.

01:05:19.024 --> 01:05:20.457
Sit down.

01:05:40.445 --> 01:05:42.310
There. Drink it down.

01:05:44.416 --> 01:05:48.011
<i>Now, we got a body
moldering away upstairs.</i>

01:05:48.119 --> 01:05:51.020
<i>Now, what do you intend
we should do about that, then?</i>

01:05:51.122 --> 01:05:53.386
<i>Later on when it's dark,</i>

01:05:53.491 --> 01:05:56.790
we'll take it to some secret place
and bury it.

01:05:56.895 --> 01:05:59.489
<i>Oh, yeah. Course we could do that.</i>

01:06:02.667 --> 01:06:04.134
Don't suppose he's got any relatives

01:06:04.235 --> 01:06:06.100
that's gonna come poking around
looking for him.

01:06:11.476 --> 01:06:14.206
<i>Seems a downright shame</i>

01:06:14.546 --> 01:06:15.808
Shame?

01:06:17.449 --> 01:06:19.679
<i>Seems an awful waste</i>

01:06:21.786 --> 01:06:25.722
<i>Such a nice plump frame
What's his name has</i>

01:06:25.824 --> 01:06:28.156
<i>Had, has</i>

01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:31.390
<i>Nor it can't be traced</i>

01:06:32.497 --> 01:06:35.091
<i>Business needs a lift</i>

01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:38.391
<i>Debts to be erased</i>

01:06:39.237 --> 01:06:42.434
<i>Think of it as thrift, as a gift</i>

01:06:43.141 --> 01:06:45.234
If you get my drift.

01:06:45.877 --> 01:06:49.278
<i>Seems an awful waste</i>

01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:54.677
<i>I mean, with the price of meat what it is</i>

01:06:54.953 --> 01:06:58.047
<i>When you get it, if you get it</i>

01:06:58.623 --> 01:06:59.749
<i>Good, you got it</i>

01:06:59.858 --> 01:07:03.817
<i>Take, for instance
Mrs. Mooney and her pie shop</i>

01:07:03.928 --> 01:07:08.024
<i>Business never better
using only pussycats and toast</i>

01:07:08.133 --> 01:07:12.001
<i>Now a pussy's good for
maybe six or seven at the most</i>

01:07:12.103 --> 01:07:14.003
<i>And I'm sure they can't
compare as far as taste</i>

01:07:14.105 --> 01:07:16.665
<i>Mrs. Lovett, what a charming notion
Eminently practical</i>

01:07:16.775 --> 01:07:19.073
<i>- And yet appropriate as always
- Well, it does seem a waste</i>

01:07:19.177 --> 01:07:21.941
<i>Mrs. Lovett, how I've lived without you
All these years I'll never know!</i>

01:07:22.046 --> 01:07:23.035
<i>Think about it</i>

01:07:23.148 --> 01:07:24.172
<i>- lots of other gentlemen'll...
- How delectable!</i>

01:07:24.282 --> 01:07:25.613
<i>- ... soon be coming for a shave
- Also undetectable</i>

01:07:25.717 --> 01:07:28.515
<i>- Won't they? Think of all them pies!
- How choice! How rare!</i>

01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:32.215
<i>For what's the sound
of the world out there?</i>

01:07:32.323 --> 01:07:35.258
<i>What, Mr. Todd, what, Mr. Todd
What is that sound?</i>

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:38.887
<i>Those crunching
noises pervading the air?</i>

01:07:38.997 --> 01:07:41.898
<i>Yes, Mr. Todd
Yes, Mr. Todd, yes, all around</i>

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.265
<i>It's man devouring man, my dear</i>

01:07:45.370 --> 01:07:49.898
<i>- And who are we to deny it in here?
- And who are we to deny it in here?</i>

01:07:53.278 --> 01:07:56.179
<i>These are desperate times, Mrs. Lovett.</i>

01:07:56.881 --> 01:07:59.816
And desperate measures are called for.

01:08:00.084 --> 01:08:03.451
<i>Here we are, hot out of the oven.</i>

01:08:04.522 --> 01:08:05.716
What is that?

01:08:05.824 --> 01:08:08.850
<i>It's priest
Have a little priest</i>

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:12.361
<i>- Is it really good?
- Sir, it's too good, at least</i>

01:08:12.464 --> 01:08:15.729
<i>Then again
they don't commit sins of the flesh</i>

01:08:15.834 --> 01:08:17.698
<i>So it's pretty fresh</i>

01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:20.997
<i>Awful lot of fat</i>

01:08:21.104 --> 01:08:22.537
<i>Only where it sat</i>

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:26.201
<i>Haven't you got poet
or something like that?</i>

01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:31.112
<i>No, you see the trouble with poet is
how do you know it's deceased?</i>

01:08:31.216 --> 01:08:33.241
<i>Try the priest</i>

01:08:42.227 --> 01:08:44.091
Lawyer's rather nice.

01:08:44.194 --> 01:08:45.992
<i>If it's for a price</i>

01:08:46.096 --> 01:08:51.000
<i>Order something else, though, to follow
Since no one should swallow it twice</i>

01:08:51.102 --> 01:08:52.796
<i>Anything that's lean?</i>

01:08:52.904 --> 01:08:57.773
<i>Well, then, if you're British and loyal
You might enjoy Royal Marine</i>

01:08:57.876 --> 01:08:59.604
<i>Anyway, it's clean</i>

01:08:59.711 --> 01:09:02.874
<i>Though, of course
it tastes of wherever it's been</i>

01:09:02.981 --> 01:09:06.381
<i>Is that squire on the fire?</i>

01:09:06.484 --> 01:09:09.920
<i>Mercy no, sir, look closer
You'll notice it's grocer</i>

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:13.013
<i>Looks thicker
More like vicar</i>

01:09:13.124 --> 01:09:16.423
<i>No, it has to be grocer
It's green</i>

01:09:19.930 --> 01:09:23.662
<i>The history of the world, my love</i>

01:09:23.768 --> 01:09:26.430
<i>Save a lot of graves
Do a lot of relatives favors</i>

01:09:26.537 --> 01:09:30.497
<i>Is those below serving those up above</i>

01:09:30.608 --> 01:09:33.167
<i>Everybody shaves
So there should be plenty of flavors</i>

01:09:33.278 --> 01:09:36.406
<i>How gratifying for once to know</i>

01:09:36.514 --> 01:09:37.947
<i>- That those above
- That those above</i>

01:09:38.049 --> 01:09:42.008
<i>- will serve those down below!
- will serve those down below!</i>

01:09:48.292 --> 01:09:49.317
What is that?

01:09:49.426 --> 01:09:52.828
<i>It's fop
Finest in the shop</i>

01:09:52.930 --> 01:09:57.630
<i>Or we have some shepherd's pie
peppered with actual shepherd on top</i>

01:09:57.735 --> 01:09:59.498
<i>And I've just begun</i>

01:09:59.604 --> 01:10:04.507
<i>Here's the politician, so oily
It's served with a doily, have one</i>

01:10:04.609 --> 01:10:06.304
<i>Put it on a bun</i>

01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:09.812
<i>Well, you never know if it's going to run</i>

01:10:09.914 --> 01:10:13.042
<i>Try the friar, fried, it's drier</i>

01:10:13.151 --> 01:10:16.917
<i>No, the clergy is really
Too coarse and too mealy</i>

01:10:17.021 --> 01:10:20.149
<i>Then actor
It's compacter</i>

01:10:20.258 --> 01:10:23.193
<i>But always arrives overdone</i>

01:10:23.294 --> 01:10:26.661
I'll come again
when you have judge on the menu.

01:10:33.071 --> 01:10:36.598
<i>Have charity towards the world, my pet</i>

01:10:36.708 --> 01:10:39.643
<i>Yes, yes, I know, my love</i>

01:10:39.744 --> 01:10:43.339
<i>We'll take the customers
that we can get</i>

01:10:43.448 --> 01:10:46.076
<i>High-born and low, my love</i>

01:10:46.184 --> 01:10:49.176
<i>We'll not discriminate great from small</i>

01:10:49.287 --> 01:10:51.380
<i>No, we'll serve anyone</i>

01:10:51.489 --> 01:10:53.013
<i>- We'll serve anyone
- Meaning anyone</i>

01:10:53.124 --> 01:10:57.254
<i>- And to anyone at all!
- And to anyone at all!</i>

01:11:16.714 --> 01:11:18.181
<i>So, it's true.</i>

01:11:19.117 --> 01:11:23.781
<i>Sir, a gentleman knocks
before entering a lady's room.</i>

01:11:24.022 --> 01:11:26.684
<i>Indeed he does, but I see no lady.</i>

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:32.085
<i>I told myself the sailor was lying,</i>

01:11:32.196 --> 01:11:36.565
<i>that my Johanna would never betray me,
never hurt me so.</i>

01:11:36.668 --> 01:11:39.432
<i>Sir, I will leave this place.</i>

01:11:40.605 --> 01:11:43.335
I think that only appropriate

01:11:43.441 --> 01:11:47.639
since you no longer find
my company to your liking.

01:11:50.181 --> 01:11:53.116
We shall provide you with new lodgings.

01:11:55.953 --> 01:11:59.753
Until this moment I have spared the rod.

01:12:01.025 --> 01:12:04.722
But the ungrateful child
has broken my heart.

01:12:06.330 --> 01:12:08.264
<i>When you've learned
to appreciate what you have,</i>

01:12:08.366 --> 01:12:10.061
perhaps we shall meet again.

01:12:10.168 --> 01:12:11.726
Until then

01:12:13.271 --> 01:12:16.138
think on your sins.

01:12:23.347 --> 01:12:24.541
No!

01:12:28.653 --> 01:12:30.177
<i>No, please!</i>

01:12:33.558 --> 01:12:36.721
Johanna! Where are you taking her?
Tell me or I swear I'II...

01:12:36.828 --> 01:12:39.353
<i>You'd kill me, boy? Here I stand!</i>

01:12:41.199 --> 01:12:42.689
Johanna!

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:53.534
<i>I feel you</i>

01:13:53.638 --> 01:13:57.472
<i>Johanna</i>

01:13:57.575 --> 01:14:01.443
<i>I feel you</i>

01:14:02.079 --> 01:14:05.674
<i>Do they think that walls can hide you?</i>

01:14:05.783 --> 01:14:09.617
<i>Even now, I'm at your window</i>

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:14.157
<i>I am in the dark beside you</i>

01:14:14.258 --> 01:14:19.389
<i>Buried sweetly in your yellow hair</i>

01:14:19.497 --> 01:14:23.991
<i>Johanna</i>

01:14:32.009 --> 01:14:35.570
<i>And are you beautiful and pale</i>

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:38.774
<i>With yellow hair, like her?</i>

01:14:38.883 --> 01:14:42.341
<i>I'd want you beautiful and pale</i>

01:14:42.453 --> 01:14:48.688
<i>The way I've dreamed you were
Johanna</i>

01:14:52.129 --> 01:14:58.534
<i>And if you're beautiful
what then with yellow hair, like wheat</i>

01:14:58.636 --> 01:15:02.197
<i>I think we shall not meet again</i>

01:15:02.306 --> 01:15:05.275
<i>My little dove, my sweet Johanna</i>

01:15:05.376 --> 01:15:11.713
<i>I'll steal you, Johanna!</i>

01:15:11.816 --> 01:15:14.148
<i>Goodbye, Johanna!</i>

01:15:15.186 --> 01:15:18.280
<i>You're gone, and yet you're mine</i>

01:15:18.389 --> 01:15:20.721
<i>I'm fine, Johanna</i>

01:15:20.825 --> 01:15:27.526
<i>- I'm fine!
- Johanna</i>

01:15:34.338 --> 01:15:40.709
<i>Smoke! Smoke! Sign of the devil
Sign of the devil. City on fire!</i>

01:15:40.811 --> 01:15:43.905
<i>Witch! Witch! Smell it, sir
An evil smell</i>

01:15:44.015 --> 01:15:45.710
<i>Every night at the vespers bell</i>

01:15:45.816 --> 01:15:47.443
<i>Smoke that comes from
the mouth of hell</i>

01:15:47.551 --> 01:15:50.520
<i>City on fire!</i>

01:15:50.621 --> 01:15:53.818
<i>City on fire</i>

01:15:54.625 --> 01:15:57.185
Mischief! Mischief! Mischief!

01:16:05.636 --> 01:16:12.098
<i>And if I never hear your voice
My turtledove, my dear</i>

01:16:12.209 --> 01:16:17.875
<i>I still have reason to rejoice
The way ahead is clear</i>

01:16:17.982 --> 01:16:22.180
<i>Johanna</i>

01:16:23.988 --> 01:16:24.977
<i>I feel</i>

01:16:25.089 --> 01:16:30.652
<i>And in that darkness when I'm blind
With what I can't forget</i>

01:16:30.761 --> 01:16:31.785
<i>Johanna</i>

01:16:31.896 --> 01:16:34.922
<i>It's always morning in my mind</i>

01:16:35.032 --> 01:16:41.301
<i>My little lamb, my pet, Johanna</i>

01:16:44.308 --> 01:16:47.471
<i>- You stay, Johanna...
- Johanna</i>

01:16:47.578 --> 01:16:50.308
<i>...the way I've dreamed you are</i>

01:16:50.815 --> 01:16:54.410
<i>Oh, look, Johanna! A star!</i>

01:16:54.518 --> 01:16:59.080
<i>Buried sweetly in your yellow hair</i>

01:16:59.190 --> 01:17:02.591
<i>A shooting star!</i>

01:17:06.497 --> 01:17:10.433
<i>There, there, somebody, somebody
look up there. Didn't I tell you?</i>

01:17:10.534 --> 01:17:14.436
<i>Smell that air. City on fire!</i>

01:17:14.538 --> 01:17:17.439
<i>Quick, sir, run and tell
Warn them all of the witch's spell</i>

01:17:17.541 --> 01:17:19.168
<i>There it is, there it is, the unholy smell</i>

01:17:19.276 --> 01:17:21.471
<i>Tell it to the Beadle and police as well
Tell them! Tell them</i>

01:17:21.579 --> 01:17:25.413
<i>Help, fiend! City on fire!</i>

01:17:25.516 --> 01:17:28.917
<i>City on fire</i>

01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:30.783
Mischief. Mischief.

01:17:40.631 --> 01:17:47.059
<i>And though I'll think of you, I guess
Until the day I die</i>

01:17:47.171 --> 01:17:52.871
<i>I think I miss you less and less
As every day goes by</i>

01:17:52.977 --> 01:17:59.712
<i>- Johanna
- Johanna</i>

01:17:59.817 --> 01:18:06.154
<i>And you'd be beautiful and pale
And look too much like her</i>

01:18:06.257 --> 01:18:11.957
<i>If only angels could prevail
We'd be the way we were</i>

01:18:12.063 --> 01:18:18.935
<i>- Johanna
- I feel you, Johanna</i>

01:18:19.036 --> 01:18:22.062
<i>Wake up, Johanna</i>

01:18:22.173 --> 01:18:25.267
<i>Another bright red day</i>

01:18:25.376 --> 01:18:32.077
<i>We learn, Johanna, to say</i>

01:18:33.751 --> 01:18:35.241
<i>Goodbye</i>

01:18:38.923 --> 01:18:42.484
<i>I'll steal</i>

01:18:45.563 --> 01:18:50.432
<i>you</i>

01:19:27.905 --> 01:19:31.671
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
May I have your attention, please?</i>

01:19:33.244 --> 01:19:35.235
<i>Are your nostrils a-quiver
and tingling as well</i>

01:19:35.346 --> 01:19:38.406
<i>At that delicate
luscious ambrosial smell?</i>

01:19:38.516 --> 01:19:40.609
<i>Yes, they are, I can tell</i>

01:19:40.718 --> 01:19:44.552
<i>Well, ladies and gentlemen
That aroma enriching the breeze</i>

01:19:44.655 --> 01:19:46.589
<i>Is like nothing
compared to its succulent source</i>

01:19:46.690 --> 01:19:50.353
<i>As the gourmets among you
will tell you, of course</i>

01:19:50.461 --> 01:19:55.296
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
You can't imagine the rapture in store</i>

01:19:56.333 --> 01:19:58.631
<i>Just inside of this door!</i>

01:20:02.907 --> 01:20:06.365
<i>There you'll sample
Mrs. Lovett's meat pies</i>

01:20:06.477 --> 01:20:09.935
<i>Savory and sweet pies
As you'll see</i>

01:20:10.047 --> 01:20:13.505
<i>You who eat pies
Mrs. Lovett's meat pies</i>

01:20:13.617 --> 01:20:17.109
<i>Conjure up the treat
pies used to be!</i>

01:20:20.858 --> 01:20:22.587
<i>- Toby!
- Coming!</i>

01:20:23.661 --> 01:20:25.390
<i>- Ale there!
- Right, ma'am!</i>

01:20:25.496 --> 01:20:26.895
<i>Quick, now!</i>

01:20:28.132 --> 01:20:31.761
<i>Nice to see you, dearie
How have you been keeping?</i>

01:20:31.869 --> 01:20:35.464
<i>Cor, me bones is weary
Toby! One for the gentleman</i>

01:20:35.573 --> 01:20:39.134
<i>Hear the birdies cheeping
Helps to keep it cheery</i>

01:20:39.243 --> 01:20:42.679
<i>Toby! Throw the old woman out!</i>

01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:46.580
<i>What's my secret?
Frankly, dear, forgive my candor</i>

01:20:46.684 --> 01:20:50.142
<i>Family secret
All to do with herbs</i>

01:20:50.254 --> 01:20:53.712
<i>Things like being
careful with your coriander</i>

01:20:53.824 --> 01:20:56.555
<i>That's what makes the gravy grander!</i>

01:21:06.403 --> 01:21:09.930
<i>Eat them slow and feel the crust
How thin she rolled it</i>

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:13.669
<i>Eat them slow
'cause every one's a prize!</i>

01:21:13.777 --> 01:21:17.213
<i>Eat them slow 'cause that's the lot
and now we've sold it!</i>

01:21:17.314 --> 01:21:18.576
<i>Come again tomorrow!</i>

01:21:18.682 --> 01:21:19.979
<i>Hold it!</i>

01:21:20.985 --> 01:21:23.044
<i>Bless my eyes!</i>

01:21:24.688 --> 01:21:26.622
<i>Fresh supplies!</i>

01:21:26.724 --> 01:21:28.089
<i>- How about it, dearie?
- Is that a pie...</i>

01:21:28.192 --> 01:21:29.989
<i>- Be here in a twinkling!
- ... fit for a king</i>

01:21:30.094 --> 01:21:32.722
<i>- Just confirms me theory, Toby!
- A wondrous sweet</i>

01:21:32.830 --> 01:21:33.990
<i>- and most delectable thing?
- God watches over us</i>

01:21:34.098 --> 01:21:35.793
<i>Didn't have an inkling, positively eerie</i>

01:21:35.899 --> 01:21:37.196
<i>You see, ma'am
why there's no meat pie</i>

01:21:37.301 --> 01:21:39.963
Toby! Throw the old woman out!

01:21:48.045 --> 01:21:51.310
Still got to keep an eye
on the household expenditure.

01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:55.578
<i>Which isn't to say we couldn't get
some nice taxidermy animals,</i>

01:21:55.686 --> 01:21:57.984
bring a touch of gentility to the place.

01:21:58.088 --> 01:22:00.579
<i>You know, a boar's head or two?</i>

01:22:01.792 --> 01:22:05.558
- Mr. T? You listening to me?
- Of course.

01:22:06.163 --> 01:22:11.226
- Then what did I just say?
- There must be a way to the Judge.

01:22:11.335 --> 01:22:14.463
Judge. Always harping
on the bloody old judge.

01:22:15.506 --> 01:22:17.736
We got a nice
respectable business now.

01:22:17.841 --> 01:22:19.706
Money coming in regular-like.

01:22:19.810 --> 01:22:21.505
<i>And since we're careful
to pick and choose,</i>

01:22:21.612 --> 01:22:25.776
<i>strangers, people who won't be missed,
who's gonna catch on?</i>

01:22:27.418 --> 01:22:29.545
<i>Mr. Todd, I'm so happy</i>

01:22:29.653 --> 01:22:31.780
<i>I could eat you up, I really could</i>

01:22:31.889 --> 01:22:35.120
<i>You know what I'd like to do, Mr. Todd?
What I dream?</i>

01:22:35.225 --> 01:22:38.922
<i>If the business stays as good
Where I'd really like to go</i>

01:22:39.530 --> 01:22:43.864
<i>In a year or so?
Don't you want to know?</i>

01:22:43.967 --> 01:22:45.093
Of course.

01:22:45.202 --> 01:22:47.033
<i>Do you really want to know?</i>

01:22:47.137 --> 01:22:49.037
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

01:23:03.787 --> 01:23:06.756
<i>By the sea, Mr. Todd
That's the life I'll covet</i>

01:23:06.857 --> 01:23:09.724
<i>By the sea, Mr. Todd
Oh, I know you'd love it</i>

01:23:09.827 --> 01:23:14.855
<i>You and me, Mr. T, we could be alone
In a house what we'd almost own</i>

01:23:14.965 --> 01:23:18.196
<i>- Down by the sea
- Anything you say</i>

01:23:18.302 --> 01:23:21.100
<i>Wouldn't that be smashing?</i>

01:23:22.005 --> 01:23:25.133
<i>Think how snug it'll be
Underneath our flannel</i>

01:23:25.242 --> 01:23:28.211
<i>When it's just you and me
And the English Channel</i>

01:23:28.312 --> 01:23:31.110
<i>In our cozy retreat
Kept all neat and tidy</i>

01:23:31.215 --> 01:23:36.380
<i>We'll have chums over every Friday
By the sea</i>

01:23:36.487 --> 01:23:41.982
<i>Don't you love the weather
by the sea?</i>

01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:45.954
<i>We'll grow old together</i>

01:23:46.263 --> 01:23:50.723
<i>By the seaside
By the beautiful sea</i>

01:23:55.839 --> 01:23:58.831
<i>It'll be so quiet that who'll come by it</i>

01:23:58.942 --> 01:24:01.274
<i>except a seagull?</i>

01:24:02.146 --> 01:24:06.583
<i>We shouldn't try it
though, till it's legal for two!</i>

01:24:07.951 --> 01:24:11.079
<i>But a seaside wedding could be devised</i>

01:24:11.188 --> 01:24:14.021
<i>Me rumpled bedding legitimized</i>

01:24:14.124 --> 01:24:19.756
<i>Me eyelids'll flutter, I'll turn into butter
The moment I mutter "I do!"</i>

01:24:19.863 --> 01:24:23.526
Will you take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

01:24:27.671 --> 01:24:29.696
You may kiss your bride.

01:24:42.085 --> 01:24:47.955
<i>Down by the sea
Married nice and proper</i>

01:24:48.158 --> 01:24:53.755
<i>By the sea
Bring along your chopper</i>

01:24:53.864 --> 01:25:00.326
<i>To the seaside
By the beautiful sea</i>

01:25:18.555 --> 01:25:21.183
<i>I brought you some breakfast, dear.</i>

01:25:25.062 --> 01:25:28.088
Mr. T? Can I ask you a question?

01:25:29.299 --> 01:25:30.391
What?

01:25:31.468 --> 01:25:33.766
What did your Lucy look like?

01:25:36.707 --> 01:25:38.971
<i>Can't really remember, can you?</i>

01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:42.278
She had yellow hair.

01:25:44.214 --> 01:25:47.115
<i>You gotta leave this all behind,
you know.</i>

01:25:48.919 --> 01:25:50.511
She's gone.

01:25:52.155 --> 01:25:54.453
<i>Life is for the alive, my dear.</i>

01:25:55.592 --> 01:25:58.322
<i>We could have a life, us two.</i>

01:25:58.428 --> 01:26:00.453
Maybe not like I dreamed.

01:26:01.532 --> 01:26:03.693
Maybe not like you remember.

01:26:04.768 --> 01:26:06.565
But we could get by.

01:26:15.178 --> 01:26:19.308
<i>- Mr. Todd! Mrs. Lovett, ma'am?
- What is it, Anthony?</i>

01:26:19.416 --> 01:26:23.284
- He has her locked in a madhouse.
- Johanna.

01:26:23.387 --> 01:26:24.854
Fogg's Asylum.

01:26:24.955 --> 01:26:29.722
I've circled the place a dozen times.
There's no way in. It's a fortress.

01:26:29.826 --> 01:26:32.727
- I've got him.
- Mr. Todd?

01:26:33.997 --> 01:26:35.624
We've got her.

01:26:36.967 --> 01:26:38.332
Where do you suppose
all the wigmakers

01:26:38.435 --> 01:26:40.869
in London go to obtain their hair?

01:26:41.672 --> 01:26:42.900
Bedlam.

01:26:43.707 --> 01:26:47.575
- They get it from the lunatics at Bedlam.
- I don't understand.

01:26:49.079 --> 01:26:52.105
We shall set you up
as a wigmaker's apprentice.

01:26:52.215 --> 01:26:55.343
That'll gain you access.
And then you take her.

01:26:56.086 --> 01:26:57.747
<i>Go, quickly, go!</i>

01:26:59.256 --> 01:27:00.689
Fetch the boy.

01:27:00.791 --> 01:27:04.124
Don't you think you should
leave the boy behind?

01:27:18.675 --> 01:27:22.771
<i>- Toby. Mr. Todd needs you.
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

01:27:35.759 --> 01:27:37.090
Mr. T?

01:27:39.663 --> 01:27:43.622
<i>- Do you know where the Old Bailey is?
- Yes, sir. Not that I ever been there.</i>

01:27:43.734 --> 01:27:47.830
Take this there.
Seek out a Judge Turpin. Repeat that.

01:27:47.938 --> 01:27:50.406
Go to Old Bailey. Find Judge Turpin.

01:27:50.507 --> 01:27:53.943
<i>You put that into his hands.
Only to him, you understand?</i>

01:27:54.044 --> 01:27:55.136
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:27:55.245 --> 01:27:57.509
<i>And while I'm out, do you mind
if I stop by the grocer just to pick...</i>

01:27:57.614 --> 01:28:00.276
<i>No. You're not to stop,
you're not to speak.</i>

01:28:00.384 --> 01:28:02.978
You're to deliver the letter.
Do you understand?

01:28:03.086 --> 01:28:04.610
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:28:34.785 --> 01:28:36.252
<i>Where you been, lad?</i>

01:28:36.353 --> 01:28:41.017
We had quite the rush at dinner time.
Me poor bones is ready to drop.

01:28:41.124 --> 01:28:43.422
Mr. Todd sent me on an errand.

01:28:43.527 --> 01:28:44.516
<i>And on the way back,</i>

01:28:44.628 --> 01:28:47.495
<i>I went by the workhouse,
just to take a look.</i>

01:28:47.597 --> 01:28:51.397
<i>And I was thinking, but for you,
I'd be there now.</i>

01:28:52.502 --> 01:28:54.299
Or someplace worse.

01:28:54.404 --> 01:28:56.395
Seems like the good Lord
sent you for me.

01:28:56.506 --> 01:28:59.873
<i>Oh, love, I feel quite the same way.</i>

01:28:59.976 --> 01:29:01.876
<i>Listen to me, please.</i>

01:29:01.978 --> 01:29:04.242
You know there's nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

01:29:04.347 --> 01:29:07.475
<i>Say, if there were someone around,</i>

01:29:08.385 --> 01:29:10.148
someone bad?

01:29:10.754 --> 01:29:13.154
Only you didn't know it.

01:29:13.256 --> 01:29:16.987
What is this?
What are you talking about?

01:29:19.129 --> 01:29:25.591
<i>Nothing's gonna harm you
Not while I'm around</i>

01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:32.565
<i>Nothing's gonna harm you
No, sir, not while I'm around</i>

01:29:32.676 --> 01:29:34.200
What do you mean "someone bad"?

01:29:34.311 --> 01:29:40.841
<i>Demons are prowling everywhere
nowadays</i>

01:29:41.685 --> 01:29:47.954
<i>I'll send them howling, I don't care
I got ways</i>

01:29:49.226 --> 01:29:52.161
<i>Hush, darling, there's no need for this.</i>

01:29:53.897 --> 01:30:00.268
<i>No one's gonna hurt you
No one's gonna dare</i>

01:30:01.538 --> 01:30:07.170
<i>Others can desert you
Not to worry, whistle, I'll be there</i>

01:30:08.011 --> 01:30:11.777
<i>Demons will charm you
With a smile</i>

01:30:11.882 --> 01:30:17.684
<i>For a while, but in time</i>

01:30:17.788 --> 01:30:20.552
<i>Nothing can harm you</i>

01:30:21.792 --> 01:30:26.923
<i>Not while I'm around</i>

01:30:30.534 --> 01:30:32.195
<i>That's nice, dear.</i>

01:30:32.903 --> 01:30:37.533
<i>Now, what is all this foolishness?
What are you talking about?</i>

01:30:38.275 --> 01:30:42.143
Little things that
I've been thinking about Mr. Todd.

01:30:43.113 --> 01:30:48.107
<i>Not to worry, not to worry
I may not be smart, but I ain't dumb</i>

01:30:49.386 --> 01:30:54.585
<i>I can do it, put me to it
Show me something I can overcome</i>

01:30:55.859 --> 01:30:59.886
<i>Not to worry, ma'am</i>

01:31:02.699 --> 01:31:07.193
<i>Being close and being clever
Ain't like being true</i>

01:31:08.271 --> 01:31:13.800
<i>I don't need to, I won't never
Hide a thing from you</i>

01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:17.311
<i>Like some</i>

01:31:19.082 --> 01:31:23.280
<i>Now, Toby, dear, haven't we
had enough of this foolish chatter?</i>

01:31:23.386 --> 01:31:24.717
Here.

01:31:24.821 --> 01:31:29.986
How about I give you
a nice shiny new penny

01:31:30.093 --> 01:31:32.823
and you go get us some toffees?

01:31:35.165 --> 01:31:36.826
That's Signor Pirelli's purse!

01:31:36.933 --> 01:31:39.766
<i>No, it's not. Just something Mr. T
gave me for my birthday.</i>

01:31:39.870 --> 01:31:41.770
<i>That proves it! We gotta go, ma'am.</i>

01:31:41.872 --> 01:31:43.999
We gotta find the Beadle
and get the law here!

01:31:44.140 --> 01:31:46.973
<i>Toby. Hush, lad,
you're not going anywhere.</i>

01:31:47.077 --> 01:31:52.071
<i>You just sit here, nice and quiet,
next to me. That's right, right.</i>

01:31:54.985 --> 01:31:57.647
How could you think
such a thing of Mr. Todd?

01:31:57.754 --> 01:32:00.279
He's been so good to us.

01:32:04.494 --> 01:32:11.024
<i>Nothing's gonna harm you
Not while I'm around</i>

01:32:12.836 --> 01:32:18.331
<i>Nothing's gonna harm you, darling
Not while I'm around</i>

01:32:19.609 --> 01:32:25.275
<i>Demons'll charm you with a smile
For a while</i>

01:32:25.382 --> 01:32:28.510
<i>But in time</i>

01:32:28.618 --> 01:32:32.611
<i>Nothing's gonna harm you</i>

01:32:32.722 --> 01:32:38.354
<i>Not while I'm around</i>

01:32:42.132 --> 01:32:45.101
Funny we should be having
this little chat right now.

01:32:45.201 --> 01:32:47.396
'Cause I was just thinking...

01:32:48.305 --> 01:32:50.933
You know how you've always fancied
coming into the bake house with me

01:32:51.041 --> 01:32:54.169
<i>- to help make the pies?
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

01:32:54.344 --> 01:32:58.678
<i>Well, no time like the present, eh?</i>

01:33:18.568 --> 01:33:22.004
<i>I feel bad for you, going up
and down all these stairs.</i>

01:33:22.105 --> 01:33:25.905
<i>- Well, that'll be your job now.
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

01:33:30.347 --> 01:33:32.611
<i>Quite a stink, ain't there?</i>

01:33:36.319 --> 01:33:37.650
You see those grates?

01:33:37.754 --> 01:33:40.552
<i>They go right down to the sewers,
and the smells come up.</i>

01:33:40.657 --> 01:33:43.057
Always a few rats gone home
to Jesus down there.

01:33:43.159 --> 01:33:47.061
<i>Now, this'll be the bake oven.
Three dozen at a time.</i>

01:33:47.163 --> 01:33:49.927
<i>Always be sure
the door is closed properly, like this.</i>

01:33:50.033 --> 01:33:53.628
- Door's closed properly.
- This is a grinder.

01:33:54.237 --> 01:33:57.570
Pop in the meat. Give it a good grind.

01:34:00.877 --> 01:34:02.572
Pops out there.

01:34:04.481 --> 01:34:05.846
You try.

01:34:07.550 --> 01:34:08.778
Good grind.

01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:12.149
Comes out there.

01:34:14.157 --> 01:34:15.488
That's my boy.

01:34:15.592 --> 01:34:18.425
<i>I'm just gonna pop upstairs,
back in two shakes, all right?</i>

01:34:18.528 --> 01:34:21.759
You mind if I have a pie while I wait?

01:34:21.865 --> 01:34:23.856
<i>As many as you like, son.</i>

01:34:36.679 --> 01:34:38.044
<i>Yes, sir, I agree.</i>

01:34:38.148 --> 01:34:39.615
It would be to our mutual interest

01:34:39.716 --> 01:34:43.652
to come to some arrangement
in regard to my poor children's hair.

01:34:43.753 --> 01:34:45.186
Brunettes.

01:34:46.756 --> 01:34:48.246
Redheads.

01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:53.428
I keep the blondes in here.

01:34:53.530 --> 01:34:56.090
<i>It was yellow hair
you was looking for, sir?</i>

01:34:56.199 --> 01:34:57.564
Yes.

01:35:28.631 --> 01:35:32.658
<i>- That one there has the shade I need.
- Come, child.</i>

01:35:39.409 --> 01:35:42.901
Smile for the gentleman
and you shall have a sweetie.

01:35:44.914 --> 01:35:47.178
<i>Now, where shall I cut?</i>

01:35:48.585 --> 01:35:51.952
<i>Not another word, Mr. Fogg,
or it will be your last.</i>

01:35:53.890 --> 01:35:58.759
<i>Now, I leave you
to the mercy of your children.</i>

01:36:09.172 --> 01:36:12.505
<i>I got him locked in.
But if he escapes, he'll go to the law.</i>

01:36:12.609 --> 01:36:14.839
<i>- Then he won't escape.
- I don't know, Mr. Todd.</i>

01:36:14.944 --> 01:36:17.208
The Judge'll be here soon.

01:36:18.781 --> 01:36:21.614
<i>'Scuse me, sir. Gave me a fright.</i>

01:36:21.718 --> 01:36:24.710
<i>Not my intention, good madam.
I assure you.</i>

01:36:25.488 --> 01:36:28.480
Though I am here on official business.

01:36:29.159 --> 01:36:34.426
<i>You see, there's been some complaints
about the stink from your chimney.</i>

01:36:34.531 --> 01:36:37.557
They say at night
it is something most foul.

01:36:38.434 --> 01:36:41.528
Health regulations
and the general public welfare

01:36:41.638 --> 01:36:43.538
<i>naturally being my duty,</i>

01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:46.768
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take a look

01:36:49.646 --> 01:36:51.341
at your bakehouse.

01:36:52.749 --> 01:36:54.239
<i>Of course, sir.</i>

01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:58.013
<i>But first, why don't you come upstairs?
Let me pamper you.</i>

01:36:59.789 --> 01:37:02.724
Much as I do appreciate
tonsorial doormen

01:37:02.825 --> 01:37:05.293
I really ought to see
to my official obligations first.

01:37:05.395 --> 01:37:07.386
I completely understand.

01:37:10.767 --> 01:37:15.329
<i>If you'll indulge me, sir,
what is that exotic aroma?</i>

01:37:18.308 --> 01:37:21.334
<i>Me secret, is a touch of ambergris.</i>

01:37:22.712 --> 01:37:25.374
Dare I offer you something
a tad more appropriate

01:37:25.481 --> 01:37:27.881
for a gentleman of your standing?

01:37:27.984 --> 01:37:30.919
<i>The ladies will greatly appreciate it, sir.</i>

01:37:33.790 --> 01:37:37.055
You're the expert in these matters.

01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:39.094
Only take a moment.

01:37:43.233 --> 01:37:45.724
<i>Would you like a bit of bay rum, sir?</i>

01:37:45.835 --> 01:37:48.099
Bay rum is very bracing.

01:38:53.936 --> 01:38:57.565
<i>Let me out! Please, let me out!</i>

01:39:00.343 --> 01:39:01.970
Let me out!

01:39:19.629 --> 01:39:20.789
Toby?

01:39:22.598 --> 01:39:24.156
Where is he?

01:39:28.271 --> 01:39:33.140
<i>Toby, where are you, love?</i>

01:39:35.244 --> 01:39:36.506
Toby?

01:39:40.483 --> 01:39:44.112
<i>Nothing's gonna harm you</i>

01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:47.451
<i>Not while I'm around</i>

01:39:47.557 --> 01:39:48.819
Toby?

01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:52.924
<i>Where are you hiding?</i>

01:39:54.464 --> 01:39:55.624
Toby?

01:39:56.833 --> 01:40:00.030
<i>Nothing's gonna harm you, darling</i>

01:40:02.538 --> 01:40:05.132
<i>Not while I'm around</i>

01:40:09.178 --> 01:40:10.440
Toby?

01:40:12.582 --> 01:40:14.015
Mr. Todd!

01:40:16.052 --> 01:40:17.644
You wait for him here.

01:40:17.754 --> 01:40:21.246
I'll return with a coach
in less than half an hour.

01:40:21.357 --> 01:40:25.817
Don't worry. No one'll recognize you.
You're safe now.

01:40:26.829 --> 01:40:31.664
<i>Safe? So, we run away
and then all our dreams come true?</i>

01:40:32.769 --> 01:40:34.430
I hope so.

01:40:35.238 --> 01:40:38.435
I've never had dreams. Only nightmares.

01:40:39.442 --> 01:40:40.841
<i>Johanna,</i>

01:40:41.577 --> 01:40:45.035
when we're free of this place
all the ghosts will go away.

01:40:45.148 --> 01:40:48.584
<i>No, Anthony. They never go away.</i>

01:40:49.652 --> 01:40:53.383
I'll be right back to you.
Half an hour and we'll be free.

01:41:28.825 --> 01:41:31.453
<i>Beadle! Beadle!</i>

01:41:32.662 --> 01:41:37.429
<i>No good hiding, I saw you</i>

01:41:37.533 --> 01:41:42.493
<i>Are you in there still, Beadle?
Beadle?</i>

01:41:42.605 --> 01:41:45.403
<i>Beadle, dear Beadle?</i>

01:41:47.543 --> 01:41:50.671
<i>Beadle deedle deedle
deedle deedle dumpling</i>

01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:52.975
<i>Beadle dumpling...</i>

01:41:59.989 --> 01:42:03.015
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

01:42:05.261 --> 01:42:06.751
<i>Evil is here, sir.</i>

01:42:06.863 --> 01:42:11.459
<i>The stink of evil, from below, from her!
Oh, she's the Devil's wife.</i>

01:42:11.567 --> 01:42:15.560
<i>Beware her, sir.
She with no pity in her heart.</i>

01:42:17.573 --> 01:42:20.440
<i>Don't I know you, mister?</i>

01:42:20.543 --> 01:42:22.010
Mr. Todd?

01:42:33.456 --> 01:42:34.980
Where is she?

01:42:36.425 --> 01:42:39.019
<i>Below, Your Honor. With my neighbor.</i>

01:42:40.029 --> 01:42:43.590
Thank heavens
the sailor did not molest her.

01:42:43.699 --> 01:42:48.261
<i>Thank heavens, too,
she has seen the error of her ways.</i>

01:42:49.138 --> 01:42:51.402
<i>- She has?
- Oh, yes.</i>

01:42:52.275 --> 01:42:54.573
Your lesson was well-learned.

01:42:54.677 --> 01:42:58.773
She speaks only of you.
Longing for forgiveness.

01:43:00.583 --> 01:43:02.744
Then she shall have it.

01:43:03.819 --> 01:43:07.186
<i>- She'll be here soon, you say?
- Yes.</i>

01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:09.758
<i>Excellent, my friend.</i>

01:43:11.761 --> 01:43:13.422
How about a shave?

01:43:14.830 --> 01:43:16.764
<i>Sit, sir. Sit.</i>

01:43:19.769 --> 01:43:25.799
<i>- Oh, pretty women
- Pretty women, yes</i>

01:43:25.908 --> 01:43:28.968
<i>Johanna, Johanna</i>

01:43:29.078 --> 01:43:32.673
<i>Pretty women
Pretty women are a wonder</i>

01:43:32.782 --> 01:43:34.374
<i>Pretty women!</i>

01:43:34.483 --> 01:43:37.384
<i>What we do for pretty women!</i>

01:43:37.486 --> 01:43:41.149
<i>- Blowing out their candles
- Blowing out their candles</i>

01:43:41.257 --> 01:43:44.852
<i>- Or combing out their hair
- Or combing out their hair</i>

01:43:44.961 --> 01:43:46.656
<i>Then they leave</i>

01:43:46.762 --> 01:43:50.323
<i>- Even when they leave
- Even when they leave you and vanish</i>

01:43:50.433 --> 01:43:53.334
<i>- They still are there
- They somehow can still remain</i>

01:43:53.436 --> 01:43:58.373
<i>- There with you, there
- They're there</i>

01:43:59.175 --> 01:44:02.770
How seldom it is
one meets a fellow spirit.

01:44:02.878 --> 01:44:07.116
<i>With fellow tastes in women, at least.</i>

01:44:07.950 --> 01:44:09.417
What's that?

01:44:10.319 --> 01:44:13.220
<i>The years, no doubt,
have changed me, sir.</i>

01:44:13.322 --> 01:44:16.223
<i>But then, I suppose the face of a barber,</i>

01:44:16.325 --> 01:44:20.386
<i>the face of a prisoner,
a dog, is not particularly memorable.</i>

01:44:27.136 --> 01:44:29.570
Benjamin Barker.

01:44:29.905 --> 01:44:32.738
Benjamin Barker!

01:45:10.579 --> 01:45:14.037
<i>Rest now, my friend</i>

01:45:16.185 --> 01:45:20.417
<i>Rest now forever</i>

01:45:21.891 --> 01:45:27.158
<i>Sleep now the untroubled</i>

01:45:27.263 --> 01:45:32.826
<i>Sleep of the angels</i>

01:45:44.013 --> 01:45:46.106
<i>Come for a shave, have you, lad?</i>

01:45:46.215 --> 01:45:47.807
<i>No, I...</i>

01:45:51.687 --> 01:45:54.451
Everyone needs a good shave.

01:46:01.664 --> 01:46:03.723
Forget my face.

01:46:07.570 --> 01:46:10.801
<i>Die! God in heaven, die!</i>

01:46:24.653 --> 01:46:26.143
You.

01:46:35.097 --> 01:46:36.894
Why did you scream?

01:46:36.999 --> 01:46:39.968
<i>He was clutching onto me dress,
but he's finished now.</i>

01:46:40.069 --> 01:46:42.503
I'll take care of it. Open the door.

01:46:42.605 --> 01:46:44.903
<i>Open the door, I said.</i>

01:47:39.094 --> 01:47:41.756
"Don't I know you?" she said.

01:47:51.507 --> 01:47:53.338
You knew she lived.

01:47:55.311 --> 01:47:57.575
I was only thinking of you.

01:48:01.183 --> 01:48:03.151
You lied to me.

01:48:03.252 --> 01:48:06.813
<i>No, no, not lied at all
No, I never lied</i>

01:48:06.922 --> 01:48:08.583
<i>- Lucy...
- Said she took a poison</i>

01:48:12.995 --> 01:48:14.257
