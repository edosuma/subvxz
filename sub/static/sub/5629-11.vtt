You have reached the office of Michel Dorn.

00:33.579 --> 00:35.571
Please leave a message after the tone.

00:35.686 --> 00:37.680
Mr. Dorn, it's Freja Jensen.

00:37.681 --> 00:41.065
I'm on the 7-30 train from Copenhagen, um,

00:41.119 --> 00:43.116
I don't when it's gonna arrive, but

00:43.132 --> 00:45.347
I'm gonna go straight
to your office, and...

00:45.379 --> 00:46.845
I have something that...

00:47.491 --> 00:49.533
Well, I'm very eager to see you.

00:49.833 --> 00:51.077
OK. Bye.

00:53.177 --> 00:54.413
Sorry.

00:54.909 --> 00:56.688
Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you.

00:56.845 --> 00:59.488
- Did I... did I get any on your...
- No, no, I'm OK.

00:59.608 --> 01:02.613
- How about you?
- Yeah, I'm f... a little bit, uh...

01:02.654 --> 01:05.084
just fine, uh, what are you doing here?

01:05.086 --> 01:07.753
I got a symposium in Gothenburg, so...

01:08.047 --> 01:09.470
how very dull.

01:09.757 --> 01:11.164
How about you?

01:11.585 --> 01:14.329
Uh, I'm meeting a friend in Bremen.

01:14.376 --> 01:15.798
Oh, too bad.

01:15.821 --> 01:18.472
When I saw you, I was hoping
we'd be on the same train, so...

01:18.592 --> 01:19.873
Yeah.

01:20.524 --> 01:23.998
- Uh, well, uh, have a good trip.
- Have a good trip.

01:24.466 --> 01:27.622
Is that it? Freja, what
is going on? I mean...

01:27.623 --> 01:29.406
It's been weeks, you don't return my calls.

01:29.407 --> 01:30.741
Sorry, I've been distracted.

01:30.742 --> 01:32.762
- It's nothing, really, it's nothing.
- But, did I do something?

01:32.763 --> 01:35.543
No, no. My train is boarding, I have to go.

01:36.687 --> 01:37.943
Freja?

01:49.985 --> 01:51.185
Sorry.

01:59.245 --> 02:00.917
Can I help you with that?

02:01.825 --> 02:03.420
I got it. Thank you.

02:32.514 --> 02:34.989
Do you how much longer
until we get to The Hague?

02:35.113 --> 02:39.068
Well, we passed Bremen a little while
ago, so I'd say three hours or so.

02:39.069 --> 02:40.692
OK. Thanks.

02:44.876 --> 02:46.213
Are you OK?

02:46.719 --> 02:48.180
I'm fine. Thank you.

03:45.146 --> 03:46.532
Excuse me.

03:46.615 --> 03:48.540
The train is in the station.

04:29.519 --> 04:31.497
Mr. Dorn, it's Freja Jensen.

04:31.498 --> 04:34.856
I'm on the 7-30 train
from Copenhagen and...

04:34.898 --> 04:36.950
I don't when it's gonna arrive, but

04:36.951 --> 04:39.288
I'm gonna go straight
to your office, and...

04:39.289 --> 04:40.846
I have something that...

04:41.547 --> 04:43.448
Well, I'm very eager to see you.

04:43.860 --> 04:45.102
OK. Bye.

04:48.037 --> 04:50.071
Miss Jensen did not make it,

04:50.102 --> 04:52.982
she was found dead, in a locked lavatory

04:53.000 --> 04:54.816
on the train from Copenhagen.

04:54.878 --> 04:56.153
Cause of death?

04:56.501 --> 04:59.486
- As yet unknown.
- The Hague police are investigating.

04:59.765 --> 05:01.898
But given her message,
you would figure the worst.

05:01.923 --> 05:03.147
I do.

05:03.362 --> 05:05.002
What was she coming to see you about?

05:05.007 --> 05:07.482
She would not disclose
that on the telephone.

05:07.551 --> 05:09.224
What she would volunteer,

05:09.291 --> 05:13.405
she was bringing me a story
of international importance.

05:13.767 --> 05:16.395
And that thousands of lives were at stake.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.970
Ellie, what do you have on her?

05:17.971 --> 05:21.259
Ah, well, she called herself
a freelance journalist, but

05:21.260 --> 05:23.388
she never really made
much of a career of it.

05:23.450 --> 05:25.322
Both of her parents are deceased.

05:25.347 --> 05:27.134
Died in a car crash ten years ago.

05:27.135 --> 05:29.790
Her only next of kin is
her younger sister, Lea.

05:29.812 --> 05:33.917
So, are we thinking an investigative
journalist on to a hot story?

05:34.190 --> 05:37.540
Most articles she wrote
were cultural feature pieces:

05:37.541 --> 05:39.467
"Where to buy coffee in Copenhagen?",

05:39.468 --> 05:42.521
"The best spas in Baden-Baden",
that sort of thing.

05:42.522 --> 05:44.962
Ellie, is there anything in your research

05:44.963 --> 05:47.010
that could throw up a motive for murder?

05:47.011 --> 05:48.604
If she was murdered.

05:48.605 --> 05:52.209
If this is an international story,
with thousands of lives at stake

05:52.210 --> 05:54.749
it comes to us. Let's find out.

05:54.804 --> 05:56.004
Fast.

05:57.546 --> 05:59.679
_

05:59.710 --> 06:01.999
_

06:02.000 --> 06:04.438
Lea is in total shock, you understand.

06:04.439 --> 06:07.454
Her sister was all the
family she had in the world.

06:07.517 --> 06:08.717
Why is she here?

06:08.853 --> 06:10.495
She had bone cancer.

06:10.585 --> 06:13.484
But suffered a stroke during
surgery nine months ago.

06:13.620 --> 06:15.583
How often did her sister come to see her?

06:15.593 --> 06:16.827
Oh, every day.

06:16.846 --> 06:18.215
They were very close.

06:20.731 --> 06:21.931
Come in.

06:22.717 --> 06:23.917
Lea,

06:23.918 --> 06:26.473
these are the ICC inspectors who phoned.

06:27.845 --> 06:29.228
Hi, Lea.

06:29.874 --> 06:33.061
I'm Inspector Strand,
this is Inspector Costante.

06:34.118 --> 06:35.974
We're so sorry for your loss.

06:36.925 --> 06:39.171
I just want you to find who did this.

06:39.990 --> 06:41.475
"Who did this"?

06:41.572 --> 06:43.802
You... you think your sister was murdered?

06:44.772 --> 06:46.446
Someone killed Freja.

06:46.839 --> 06:48.448
There's no doubt in my mind.

06:57.239 --> 06:59.230
- Hi.
- Hello.

06:59.231 --> 07:01.872
I'm Margaret Booz, the train manager.

07:02.100 --> 07:04.001
Where's the lavatory
where you found the body?

07:04.016 --> 07:05.216
Right here.

07:07.189 --> 07:08.592
Have you got a passenger manifest?

07:08.593 --> 07:10.314
- Yes, I have it here for you.
- Thanks.

07:10.315 --> 07:11.515
Thanks.

07:17.541 --> 07:19.292
The police said it's a murder.

07:19.324 --> 07:22.383
But, how could someone kill
her in a locked lavatory?

07:22.384 --> 07:24.580
Well, we're not sure anybody did yet.

07:24.907 --> 07:26.746
Door was locked from the inside,

07:26.942 --> 07:28.500
they would have needed a key.

07:29.651 --> 07:30.851
Well,

07:30.852 --> 07:32.647
not necessarily.

07:41.199 --> 07:42.658
Misspent youth.

07:45.559 --> 07:48.582
So, Miss Jensen's seat, it was 65C?

07:48.702 --> 07:50.692
That's right. I will show you.

07:53.821 --> 07:55.442
Trouble in paradise?

07:56.517 --> 07:58.870
Just keep scraping, Sebastian.

08:03.745 --> 08:05.879
My sister always put me first.

08:08.391 --> 08:10.317
She could have been a brilliant reporter.

08:10.318 --> 08:11.518
I just know it.

08:11.787 --> 08:13.071
She was so clever.

08:13.585 --> 08:15.719
What makes you think
your sister was murdered?

08:17.903 --> 08:19.231
She had a story.

08:20.679 --> 08:22.361
She wouldn't tell me what it was.

08:22.401 --> 08:24.261
She'd sit just where you're sitting, and...

08:24.883 --> 08:26.341
and type on her laptop.

08:26.953 --> 08:28.739
Once she set her mind on something

08:29.282 --> 08:30.606
nothing would stop her.

08:30.770 --> 08:32.207
Um, her laptop?

08:32.288 --> 08:33.974
Do you know where we could find it?

08:34.501 --> 08:35.702
No.

08:36.203 --> 08:38.051
But she always kept it with her.

08:38.331 --> 08:40.823
Do you have any idea what
story she was writing?

08:41.104 --> 08:42.304
No.

08:42.589 --> 08:44.390
Do you know someone who might?

08:44.982 --> 08:47.725
Like... like an editor, or... or a friend?

08:48.707 --> 08:50.709
There was a guy she was seeing.

08:50.967 --> 08:52.167
A guy?

08:52.281 --> 08:53.908
Would you happen to know his name?

08:56.176 --> 08:57.912
Andre or...

08:58.927 --> 09:00.311
Antoine.

09:00.747 --> 09:04.396
I... I overheard her talking
on the phone once, but,

09:05.605 --> 09:07.158
she never told me his name.

09:07.215 --> 09:10.214
She kept promising to bring
him around, to meet me one day.

09:12.067 --> 09:13.505
But she never did.

09:14.927 --> 09:17.061
In the statement that you
made to The Hague police,

09:17.062 --> 09:20.281
you said that Miss Jensen entered
the lavatory with an overnight bag.

09:20.326 --> 09:21.526
That's right.

09:23.222 --> 09:26.119
She kept it on her lap the entire journey.

09:26.413 --> 09:28.436
And it wasn't found on the carriage.

09:28.707 --> 09:29.907
Hm...?

09:30.038 --> 09:31.467
Was she drinking coffee?

09:31.544 --> 09:33.689
I'm sorry, I didn't notice.

09:42.071 --> 09:43.271
Here.

09:53.467 --> 09:55.204
Like Cinderella's slipper.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.248
Or Snow White's apple.

10:00.752 --> 10:03.905
So, nobody had to break in to the lavatory,

10:04.393 --> 10:06.179
not if Miss Jensen was poisoned.

10:10.849 --> 10:13.715
Industrial Park - PRAGUE

10:28.842 --> 10:30.179
Beautiful weapon,

10:30.223 --> 10:31.480
don't you think?

10:31.780 --> 10:33.030
I suppose.

10:33.751 --> 10:36.294
It helped the Russians defeat the Nazis,

10:36.329 --> 10:38.409
now it will help us defeat them.

10:44.989 --> 10:46.868
There is only one problem.

10:47.634 --> 10:50.176
This shipment is short fifty rifles.

10:54.032 --> 10:55.409
I don't know what you mean.

10:55.414 --> 10:57.528
Which part of "short" didn't you get?

11:00.371 --> 11:01.911
There must be some mistake.

11:02.722 --> 11:04.344
I don't forgive mistakes.

11:05.964 --> 11:07.344
I promise you,

11:07.683 --> 11:09.902
- it won't happen again.
- You're right.

11:10.678 --> 11:11.878
It won't.

11:17.698 --> 11:18.986
Mr. Dudayev,

11:20.085 --> 11:21.459
Mr. Dudayev,

11:22.622 --> 11:24.045
please.

11:30.909 --> 11:34.191
You will bring me fifty extra
rifles in the next shipment

11:34.246 --> 11:36.446
at no extra charge.

11:36.447 --> 11:37.647
Yes...

11:37.989 --> 11:39.421
yes, of course.

11:43.033 --> 11:44.233
Get out.

11:46.062 --> 11:48.301
You've brought me
something for Miss Jensen.

11:53.991 --> 11:56.966
Andre or Antoine, she didn't give us much.

11:56.975 --> 11:58.716
No, but if we could find her laptop,

11:58.717 --> 12:01.046
the story she was writing
might give us a lead.

12:01.105 --> 12:03.438
Probably give us the name
of the mysterious boyfriend.

12:03.831 --> 12:05.931
You're leaning towards the
boyfriend as the suspect?

12:05.932 --> 12:08.917
Well, nine times out of ten,
it's a boyfriend or a husband,

12:08.918 --> 12:12.161
Not "All the President's Men". I
mean that is, if Freja was murdered.

12:12.162 --> 12:14.895
I'll admit, it's a bit
of a leap, going from

12:14.993 --> 12:17.087
cappuccinos to Woodward and Bernstein,

12:17.169 --> 12:19.431
but, the timing is suspicious.

12:19.714 --> 12:20.914
What's up?

12:20.958 --> 12:22.570
This was murdered, all right.

12:22.571 --> 12:23.771
How do you know?

12:23.859 --> 12:27.323
Well, we found Miss Jensen's
DNA on a discarded paper cup.

12:27.324 --> 12:30.269
The lab was able to
analyse the coffee residue.

12:30.343 --> 12:33.443
- And?
- And we found traces of aconite.

12:34.072 --> 12:35.917
Aconite is a poison, yeah?

12:35.941 --> 12:37.848
With an excellent reputation.

12:38.175 --> 12:41.425
It kills quickly, avoids
toxicological panels,

12:41.673 --> 12:43.838
and you can grow it in your gardens.

12:43.867 --> 12:46.638
It's also found in some
cardiac pharmaceuticals,

12:46.639 --> 12:48.966
it prevents ventricular dysrhythmias.

12:49.743 --> 12:51.438
Ven... ventricular what?

12:52.125 --> 12:53.528
It's a heart medicine.

12:53.529 --> 12:55.853
Uh, from her blood residue, ah

12:55.854 --> 12:58.118
we determined she ingested a lethal dose.

12:58.159 --> 13:00.611
But we have no idea who put it in the cup.

13:00.819 --> 13:02.068
Or why.

13:02.187 --> 13:03.387
Well,

13:03.620 --> 13:05.403
that rules out suicide.

13:05.440 --> 13:07.189
Can't be right all the time.

13:07.399 --> 13:09.827
Yeah, we need to find out
where she got that coffee cup.

13:09.878 --> 13:11.996
- Was it on the train?
- Great minds think alike.

13:11.997 --> 13:15.586
Well, that particular brand is
available at Copenhagen Train Station

13:15.587 --> 13:17.871
from a stand called Stoppe & Go.

13:18.238 --> 13:19.925
On our way to the station now.

13:34.944 --> 13:37.721
Look at that. She even found our factory.

13:58.008 --> 14:01.094
She was quite a nosy girl, our Miss Jensen.

14:18.156 --> 14:21.687
All that work, undone so easily.

14:29.954 --> 14:32.482
- Well done.
- Thank you, sir.

14:38.799 --> 14:40.740
I have another job for you.

14:44.906 --> 14:46.924
We have some loose ends.

14:51.758 --> 14:53.075
You got anything?

14:53.707 --> 14:56.468
I got a warrant to search
Freja Jensen's online account.

14:56.500 --> 14:59.795
- A warrant?
- See, you can teach an old dog new tricks.

15:00.112 --> 15:02.376
Unfortunately, it didn't yield much.

15:02.693 --> 15:05.213
I was rather hoping
she'd cracked a big story.

15:05.251 --> 15:07.708
Well, if she did, she kept
it off her email server.

15:08.155 --> 15:11.036
There are dozen of folders
in her DropPocket account and,

15:11.355 --> 15:13.622
- one of them looks really odd.
- Odd how?

15:13.742 --> 15:17.405
I'm not sure. The contents are long
gone, but the heading's still there.

15:17.421 --> 15:19.725
Sounds German, Fröbe.

15:20.772 --> 15:22.217
That mean anything to you?

15:23.155 --> 15:26.224
The actor who played
Goldfinger, I don't know.

15:26.269 --> 15:29.233
Well, she said to Dorn that
thousands of lives were at risk.

15:29.353 --> 15:31.833
She couldn't have been a little
more specific, don't you think?

15:35.251 --> 15:38.290
- Hope I'm not disturbing.
- Have you found something?

15:39.490 --> 15:40.903
Possibly.

15:42.015 --> 15:43.632
Do you recognize this man?

15:43.783 --> 15:45.970
He was seen on the station's CCTV

15:45.971 --> 15:48.243
talking to Freja the day she was killed.

15:48.295 --> 15:49.514
That's Doctor Nielsen.

15:49.515 --> 15:50.748
Doctor Nielsen?

15:50.924 --> 15:53.569
Yes. The surgeon at my oncology clinic.

15:54.371 --> 15:56.207
So that's how they knew each other.

15:57.211 --> 15:58.411
Yes.

15:58.634 --> 16:02.364
Lea, would Doctor Nielsen
have any reason to harm Freja?

16:03.095 --> 16:04.398
Oh my God.

16:04.600 --> 16:05.800
What?

16:06.666 --> 16:08.334
Doctor Nielsen's first name,

16:09.416 --> 16:10.690
it's Anton.

16:32.622 --> 16:34.692
Hi, Inspector Costante with the ICC.

16:34.693 --> 16:36.502
I'd like to see Doctor Nielsen.

16:36.852 --> 16:38.217
I'm Doctor Nielsen.

16:38.946 --> 16:40.259
How can I help you?

16:40.690 --> 16:41.892
Hi.

16:42.003 --> 16:44.283
I'd like to talk to you about Freja Jensen.

16:45.197 --> 16:47.591
Uh... Freja? What about her?

16:48.190 --> 16:49.553
She's dead.

16:50.793 --> 16:52.199
Oh my God.

16:52.981 --> 16:54.912
I... I just saw her yesterday morning.

16:54.913 --> 16:56.176
At the train station?

16:56.368 --> 16:57.568
Yeah.

16:57.784 --> 17:01.061
I was going to a symposium in
Sweden, she said she was headed for...

17:01.407 --> 17:02.607
for Bremen.

17:02.778 --> 17:04.422
Well, she wasn't headed for Bremen.

17:04.423 --> 17:05.931
She was headed for The Hague.

17:06.448 --> 17:08.354
And she never left the train, Doctor.

17:09.116 --> 17:10.366
She was murdered.

17:11.244 --> 17:13.585
Erm, let's... talk in here.

17:20.664 --> 17:22.435
Why would anybody murder Freja?

17:23.405 --> 17:25.145
Well, I was hoping you might tell us.

17:25.146 --> 17:26.425
I've no idea.

17:27.089 --> 17:29.970
I understand you and, ah, Miss Jensen

17:30.220 --> 17:31.984
were in a relationship?

17:34.534 --> 17:35.892
Who told you that?

17:36.095 --> 17:37.345
Do you deny it?

17:39.718 --> 17:42.084
- Would you like a lawyer, Doctor?
- No.

17:43.019 --> 17:44.365
I have nothing to hide.

17:44.366 --> 17:46.046
So you admit you, uh...

17:46.093 --> 17:47.662
you were having an affair with her?

17:48.205 --> 17:50.430
I'm a married man, Inspector.

17:51.491 --> 17:52.691
But yes.

17:52.695 --> 17:55.519
Your affair started while
her sister was a patient here?

17:55.639 --> 17:56.839
No.

17:58.176 --> 18:00.154
Not until several months later.

18:02.025 --> 18:04.702
Ran into her at a bar.
One thing led to another.

18:05.743 --> 18:07.047
Until she ended it.

18:07.436 --> 18:08.854
Why did she end it?

18:11.505 --> 18:12.814
I don't know.

18:12.916 --> 18:14.708
She stopped answering my calls.

18:14.785 --> 18:17.989
Hadn't seen her for nearly a month
until I saw her at the station.

18:18.728 --> 18:20.798
Are you familiar with the, um,

18:21.203 --> 18:23.346
the toxin called aconite?

18:27.610 --> 18:30.176
- Of course.
- It was used to kill Freja.

18:30.177 --> 18:33.127
Someone slipped it into the coffee
that she bought at the train station.

18:33.128 --> 18:34.369
Hold on.

18:34.370 --> 18:37.528
You do have access to medicine
containing aconite here, Doctor,

18:37.529 --> 18:38.729
don't you?

18:42.492 --> 18:44.904
I don't have anything more to say to you.

18:45.023 --> 18:46.541
Not without my lawyer.

18:47.855 --> 18:49.055
OK, then.

18:51.243 --> 18:54.972
By the way, do you know anything
about the story Freja was writing?

18:55.617 --> 18:57.106
Story? What story?

18:59.016 --> 19:00.216
Thank you, Doctor.

19:01.219 --> 19:02.459
I'll be in touch.

19:07.750 --> 19:10.348
_

19:10.349 --> 19:12.957
_

19:22.127 --> 19:23.327
Anything?

19:23.741 --> 19:24.945
Nothing.

19:24.946 --> 19:26.944
No paper trail, no phone records.

19:26.945 --> 19:30.551
I wish I could get my hands on that
laptop that she had in her bag, I...

19:30.792 --> 19:32.929
I wanna know what story she was writing.

19:34.311 --> 19:35.633
Maybe this will cheer you up.

19:36.563 --> 19:37.966
It's cold brewed.

19:37.967 --> 19:39.194
Cold brewed?

19:39.304 --> 19:40.793
Yeah, it's, uh,

19:40.805 --> 19:43.403
filtered for twelve hours
at room temperature, it's

19:43.404 --> 19:45.333
sweeter, less acidic.

19:45.685 --> 19:46.885
Hm.

19:57.387 --> 19:58.591
All right.

19:58.637 --> 20:00.802
I heard you're thinking
about leaving the unit.

20:04.052 --> 20:05.437
Where did you hear that?

20:13.994 --> 20:15.591
Yeah, I've not decided yet.

20:16.052 --> 20:17.252
Hmm.

20:18.363 --> 20:20.857
It's none of my business
what happened between you

20:20.858 --> 20:22.403
- and Arabela...
- You... you...

20:22.404 --> 20:24.771
- really... I...
- No, I... I think you need to hear this.

20:25.160 --> 20:27.436
When the Cross Border Unit was shut down

20:27.484 --> 20:29.462
Arabela was crushed.

20:29.689 --> 20:32.930
She was one of the best
investigators I ever worked with, but,

20:34.289 --> 20:35.581
she was sad.

20:35.667 --> 20:36.867
You know?

20:37.673 --> 20:39.651
Like, she was in mourning.

20:40.056 --> 20:41.677
Until you showed up.

20:43.337 --> 20:44.739
And she lit up.

20:46.167 --> 20:47.753
She cares about you.

20:48.195 --> 20:49.970
Probably more than you realize.

20:54.891 --> 20:56.464
Um, where's Sebastian?

20:56.465 --> 20:57.893
He has Erik tonight, why?

20:57.894 --> 21:00.659
That Internet sharing
file Freja Jensen had...

21:00.729 --> 21:03.044
Gert Fröbe, yeah, that guy
from the James Bond film.

21:03.045 --> 21:04.876
- And Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.
- Well, yes, but

21:04.877 --> 21:07.900
I... I've been running an anagram
on those five letters for hours,

21:07.901 --> 21:10.584
but then I realized it
wasn't five letters, but six.

21:10.596 --> 21:12.074
Not Fröbe, but Froße.

21:12.075 --> 21:15.660
She wrote what looked like a "B" when
actually she meant to write a "sharp S".

21:15.661 --> 21:18.737
Like "S" and "Z" or "SS"
are written in German.

21:18.738 --> 21:20.093
- Exactly.
- So,

21:20.094 --> 21:21.856
what kind of word is that, Froße?

21:21.857 --> 21:23.971
A trademark one. Look.

21:30.025 --> 21:32.531
_

21:33.192 --> 21:34.603
An anti-coagulant.

21:34.604 --> 21:38.014
She wasn't talking about
Goldfinger, but a pharmaceutical.

21:38.425 --> 21:40.208
Ellie, I could kiss you.

21:40.625 --> 21:43.587
Oh, uh, thank you, but, um...

21:43.712 --> 21:45.376
er, what does this mean?

21:45.618 --> 21:48.300
Well, it gives us a place to start.

22:37.588 --> 22:41.557
And so today, to commit the
body and soul of Freja Jensen

22:41.558 --> 22:43.740
into the loving hands of God.

22:43.916 --> 22:46.102
May she find eternal peace in Heaven,

22:46.222 --> 22:48.805
for she is home, at last.

22:49.074 --> 22:50.351
Amen.

23:20.196 --> 23:21.496
Lea,

23:21.616 --> 23:23.433
I'm sorry to disturb you here.

23:23.521 --> 23:25.063
You're not disturbing me.

23:25.725 --> 23:28.072
I just want to catch
the bastard who did this.

23:28.442 --> 23:29.887
Do you have any news?

23:30.015 --> 23:31.737
I have questions.

23:32.180 --> 23:33.380
About what?

23:33.396 --> 23:35.428
The surgery Doctor Nielsen performed,

23:35.436 --> 23:38.000
are you familiar with
a drug called "Froße"?

23:38.686 --> 23:39.886
Yeah.

23:40.036 --> 23:41.498
Thanks to Freja I am.

23:41.548 --> 23:42.748
What do you mean?

23:43.351 --> 23:44.789
Well, it's um...

23:45.893 --> 23:47.472
it's a blood thinner.

23:47.683 --> 23:49.697
A pretty expensive one,

23:49.698 --> 23:52.212
meant to reduce the risk of stroke

23:52.213 --> 23:53.593
during surgery.

23:55.333 --> 23:57.345
She wanted Doctor Nielsen to use it.

23:57.751 --> 23:58.951
And did he?

23:58.952 --> 24:00.152
Yeah.

24:00.395 --> 24:01.595
But,

24:01.704 --> 24:03.116
I still had the stroke,

24:03.412 --> 24:04.612
didn't I?

24:06.002 --> 24:09.652
We think the story your sister was
writing, we think it's about this drug.

24:09.719 --> 24:12.238
We believe whatever she
discovered caused someone

24:12.239 --> 24:14.623
to kill her to stop us from finding out.

24:15.312 --> 24:17.635
You think that's why she
went out with Doctor Nielsen?

24:18.306 --> 24:20.427
Do you think she blamed
him for your stroke?

24:21.989 --> 24:23.774
I know she blamed herself.

24:24.434 --> 24:25.634
She'd look for

24:25.635 --> 24:27.653
any explanation other than

24:28.230 --> 24:29.571
shit happens.

24:30.494 --> 24:32.196
Which is what I told her.

24:33.926 --> 24:36.333
_

24:36.364 --> 24:38.458
_

24:38.459 --> 24:39.659
Anything?

24:39.972 --> 24:43.135
It looks like our doctor is clearly
gone into some financial trouble

24:43.136 --> 24:45.977
- about two years ago.
- And what happened two years ago?

24:45.978 --> 24:48.106
Nothing as far as we can see.

24:48.190 --> 24:50.144
But he just started making money again.

24:50.228 --> 24:52.291
It just doesn't make any sense, does it?

24:52.292 --> 24:54.440
Maybe it does. Um, Lea said that

24:54.659 --> 24:56.819
Froße is an expensive drug, right?

24:56.820 --> 24:58.640
Very. It's cutting edge.

24:58.812 --> 25:02.815
And anti-coagulants must be used in almost
every surgery that the clinic performs.

25:02.816 --> 25:05.234
So he starts using a cheaper substitute.

25:05.235 --> 25:07.044
Pockets the difference
between what it costs

25:07.045 --> 25:08.819
and then what he blows for Froße,

25:08.916 --> 25:10.212
hey presto!

25:10.213 --> 25:12.360
Financial troubles disappear.

25:12.389 --> 25:15.083
I think that's it. It's a
10 billion Euros business

25:15.084 --> 25:16.931
across the continent, every year.

25:16.932 --> 25:18.783
That's a lot of people getting fake pills.

25:18.784 --> 25:22.201
Yeah, but for a doctor to deliberately
be using a counterfeit drug,

25:22.202 --> 25:23.790
I mean that's pretty low, isn't it?

25:24.623 --> 25:27.320
Unless he thought he was just
buying a cheaper substitute.

25:27.672 --> 25:29.442
Either way, if we're right,

25:29.443 --> 25:31.516
as we speak, that doctor
is performing surgeries

25:31.517 --> 25:33.743
with people who don't know
the dangers they're facing.

25:35.440 --> 25:36.753
Michel, do you have a moment?

25:36.754 --> 25:39.201
Only a minute. I'm late to court. What?

25:39.202 --> 25:41.458
We think Miss Jensen
discovered her sister's doctor

25:41.459 --> 25:43.727
was using a counterfeit
drug on his patients

25:43.728 --> 25:45.294
and that's why she was killed.

25:45.402 --> 25:46.602
You can prove it?

25:46.603 --> 25:48.946
That he murdered her? No.
But if we get a warrant

25:48.947 --> 25:50.988
to search the clinic, we
can confiscate the drug

25:50.989 --> 25:53.206
- and we can charge him for that.
- Carine,

25:53.207 --> 25:54.808
When Miss Jensen said that

25:54.846 --> 25:57.135
this was a story of
international importance

25:57.136 --> 25:59.038
with thousands of lives at stake.

25:59.039 --> 26:01.490
She was not talking about
the patients at that clinic.

26:01.877 --> 26:05.627
She was talking about the suppliers
of that medicine, who are undoubtedly

26:05.777 --> 26:08.250
peddling it to hospitals all across Europe.

26:08.727 --> 26:09.933
We raid the clinic,

26:09.934 --> 26:12.214
- we scare off the supplier.
- Exactly.

26:12.458 --> 26:13.922
We catch the little fish,

26:14.100 --> 26:15.701
the big fish gets away.

26:16.644 --> 26:18.338
You said that you ran into Miss Jensen

26:18.339 --> 26:20.485
on your way to a symposium in Sweden.

26:21.010 --> 26:22.337
But we checked,

26:22.508 --> 26:23.799
you didn't show up.

26:26.695 --> 26:27.989
I was going to.

26:28.169 --> 26:30.218
But I changed my mind at the last minute.

26:30.219 --> 26:32.028
Doctor Nielsen had nothing to do

26:32.029 --> 26:33.456
with the death of Freja Jensen.

26:33.457 --> 26:34.903
You were following her.

26:36.319 --> 26:38.969
I just wanted to see her, talk to her.

26:38.970 --> 26:40.421
About the story she was writing?

26:40.422 --> 26:44.055
- I don't know anything about any stories.
- That's why she was sleeping with you.

26:44.209 --> 26:47.476
Wasn't it? And why she stopped,
because she found out the truth.

26:47.477 --> 26:48.573
The truth?

26:48.574 --> 26:51.014
You were using counterfeit
drugs in your clinic,

26:51.015 --> 26:53.224
that is the reason that
her sister had a stroke.

26:53.225 --> 26:55.572
- That is an outrageous lie!
- Be careful.

26:55.761 --> 26:59.269
I am one phone call away
from a warrant to prove it.

26:59.608 --> 27:00.972
Then why don't you?

27:01.320 --> 27:03.904
Because we don't just want Doctor Nielsen.

27:05.148 --> 27:06.947
We need your supplier.

27:08.974 --> 27:10.402
Are you offering us a deal?

27:10.952 --> 27:12.799
If you killed Freja Jensen,

27:12.800 --> 27:14.000
no.

27:14.818 --> 27:16.825
But if you give us your supplier,

27:18.960 --> 27:20.160
yes.

27:26.948 --> 27:29.002
His name is Borz Dudayev.

27:29.731 --> 27:31.002
Dudayev?

27:31.320 --> 27:33.796
He's been on our watch list for some time.

27:35.213 --> 27:38.099
There's one more thing I want
you to do, Doctor Nielsen.

27:41.467 --> 27:43.490
All right, wiretap's up.

27:47.302 --> 27:48.649
He's making the call.

27:59.905 --> 28:01.105
Yes?

28:01.106 --> 28:02.306
It's me.

28:03.261 --> 28:05.046
I got your message yesterday.

28:05.402 --> 28:06.646
What is it, Doctor?

28:07.413 --> 28:08.696
I need to see you.

28:11.086 --> 28:12.286
Very well.

28:13.514 --> 28:15.289
I could be there on the next flight.

28:17.393 --> 28:19.162
I'd prefer to come to you.

28:21.592 --> 28:22.792
OK then.

28:33.603 --> 28:35.980
_

28:36.012 --> 28:38.566
_

28:40.093 --> 28:41.404
Right on time.

28:43.137 --> 28:44.807
Two minutes early actually.

28:54.714 --> 28:55.914
Listen,

28:56.034 --> 28:57.853
about what happened last week,

29:01.674 --> 29:03.518
I don't want you to quit, Luke.

29:07.308 --> 29:08.565
I know you don't.

29:09.690 --> 29:12.301
If you're waiting for me to apologize,

29:12.577 --> 29:14.017
that's not gonna happen.

29:33.275 --> 29:34.475
Right.

29:34.640 --> 29:35.840
Where are you going?

29:35.872 --> 29:37.134
To get a check-up.

30:01.041 --> 30:02.561
Police, get out of here.

30:02.818 --> 30:04.018
Move!

30:19.421 --> 30:21.095
Put your hands where I can see them.

30:22.233 --> 30:23.963
I said put your hands where I can see them!

30:23.964 --> 30:25.588
I've got a gun trained at your back.

30:28.011 --> 30:30.462
It's all right. Everything's
gonna be OK. Just stay calm.

30:30.463 --> 30:32.073
The whole place is surrounded.

30:33.001 --> 30:35.069
There's nowhere to go.
Just put the gun down.

30:36.637 --> 30:38.116
Drop the weapon.

30:38.732 --> 30:39.932
Drop it!

30:41.136 --> 30:42.837
There's nowhere to go. Do you hear me?

30:42.957 --> 30:44.157
Lock it.

30:45.530 --> 30:46.735
Shit.

30:46.753 --> 30:47.953
Move.

31:14.621 --> 31:16.057
All those from the clinic?

31:16.997 --> 31:19.106
Ten kilos of fake pills

31:19.107 --> 31:20.925
- for what they're worth.
- Which isn't much.

31:20.926 --> 31:24.862
Well, ten kilos of Froße would
be worth more than 250,000 Euros.

31:24.938 --> 31:27.506
Yes, which is a very large profit margin

31:27.507 --> 31:29.433
considering he bought them from Dudayev

31:29.434 --> 31:31.630
for less than 20,000 Euros.

31:31.717 --> 31:33.967
Any luck in figuring out
where these are coming from?

31:34.213 --> 31:37.348
Some. Uh, Dudayev travelled from Prague

31:37.349 --> 31:40.399
to Serbia six times in
the last eighteen months.

31:40.400 --> 31:41.881
He has some kind of

31:41.882 --> 31:44.978
manufacturing plant here,
in north-east Serbia.

31:44.979 --> 31:47.102
Which must be where he's making these.

31:47.103 --> 31:49.997
According to Freja's passport,
she was there six months ago.

31:49.998 --> 31:51.198
Smart girl.

31:51.199 --> 31:53.335
So Doctor Nielsen knew he was giving these

31:53.336 --> 31:54.930
empty pills to his patients.

31:54.931 --> 31:56.774
Well, not according to the nurses.

31:56.775 --> 31:58.297
They're pretty adamant that

31:58.298 --> 32:00.838
he believed he was using generics.

32:00.937 --> 32:03.018
So he wasn't aware of
the damage he was doing?

32:05.688 --> 32:06.888
I'm sorry.

32:07.266 --> 32:09.740
Michel, please tell me you found something.

32:09.951 --> 32:11.616
Her Majesty's government,

32:11.878 --> 32:14.608
has known for nearly ten years

32:15.258 --> 32:18.214
that Dudayev was producing
counterfeit medicines

32:18.215 --> 32:22.228
and using the proceeds to purchase
weapons for Chechen separatists.

32:22.429 --> 32:24.599
Can we use this information to arrest him?

32:24.600 --> 32:25.800
No.

32:26.079 --> 32:28.062
No, it's classified and

32:28.555 --> 32:32.575
officially, Her Majesty's
government will not interfere.

32:33.817 --> 32:35.135
What about unofficially?

32:35.207 --> 32:36.465
Unofficially,

32:37.313 --> 32:39.288
Dudayev is about to make a transfer

32:39.289 --> 32:41.930
of a new shipment of
weapons to the Chechens.

32:41.931 --> 32:44.326
- When?
- This afternoon.

32:44.870 --> 32:46.070
Do we have a location?

32:46.071 --> 32:47.674
It's in the Czech Republic.

32:47.948 --> 32:49.148
Rudná.

32:49.149 --> 32:50.932
On the route of the 916.

32:54.778 --> 32:56.696
MI6 intelligence indicates

32:56.697 --> 32:59.066
that Dudayev has a distribution point here,

32:59.067 --> 33:01.704
- an industrial park outside Prague.
- What's the plan?

33:01.705 --> 33:03.653
The plan is to go with
the Czech national police

33:03.654 --> 33:05.561
to assist and support only.

33:05.574 --> 33:06.774
Is that a good idea?

33:06.775 --> 33:08.074
We wanna catch this bastard.

33:08.075 --> 33:10.682
We will, but we need to
exercise extreme caution.

33:10.683 --> 33:11.733
Sebastian?

33:11.734 --> 33:14.945
Dudayev has been using the proceeds
of these counterfeit medicines

33:14.946 --> 33:17.449
to buy arms for Islamist
terrorists in Chechnya.

33:17.558 --> 33:18.779
They'll be at the drop.

33:18.780 --> 33:20.723
That's when the Czech police will move in.

33:20.724 --> 33:23.061
Our only interest is to apprehend Dudayev

33:23.062 --> 33:25.555
and whoever killed
Freja and Doctor Nielsen.

33:25.562 --> 33:27.688
OK, let's get this assholes.

33:30.716 --> 33:33.762
There's, ah, still just something
I don't quite understand.

33:33.763 --> 33:35.678
- What's that?
- Well, Freja started sleeping

33:35.679 --> 33:37.714
with Doctor Nielsen to
get information from him,

33:37.715 --> 33:39.725
but then she stopped
seeing him a month ago.

33:39.726 --> 33:42.942
Probably because she found out
he was using counterfeit medicine.

33:42.992 --> 33:44.432
Yeah, I just... I...

33:44.433 --> 33:47.436
I think we're still missing something.
Do you mind if I go and check it out?

33:47.590 --> 33:49.399
OK. Keep me informed.

33:53.059 --> 33:55.331
_

33:55.473 --> 33:58.243
_

34:04.676 --> 34:06.221
Vehicle approaching.

34:24.233 --> 34:25.607
There's Dudayev.

34:27.301 --> 34:29.730
Two men. Can you ID them Sebastian?

34:30.196 --> 34:32.371
Running facial recognition now.

34:34.319 --> 34:37.012
Khoda Umaröv and Zargan Shishani.

34:37.013 --> 34:40.150
Responsible for the
massacre of 237 hostages

34:40.152 --> 34:42.571
in the North Caucasus in 2012.

34:42.788 --> 34:44.670
Not the nicest of fellas.

34:48.024 --> 34:49.742
Thank you, Mrs. Peterson.

34:49.945 --> 34:52.568
Are you sure I can't offer
you some coffee, or tea?

34:52.569 --> 34:53.862
Ah, no, thank you.

34:55.908 --> 34:58.563
Eleanor Delfont-Bogard with the ICC.

34:58.617 --> 35:00.036
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:00.756 --> 35:02.134
I got your message.

35:02.757 --> 35:04.919
You said that the man

35:04.953 --> 35:07.749
who sold Doctor Nielsen
that medicine had him killed?

35:07.750 --> 35:09.306
Well, yes, he, um...

35:10.437 --> 35:13.266
our team are on the way
to arrest that man now.

35:14.570 --> 35:16.286
The police are moving in already.

35:17.533 --> 35:19.751
- Do you think they heard something?
- Yeah, possibly.

35:31.023 --> 35:32.579
Dudayev has disappeared.

35:32.699 --> 35:33.934
Where did he go?

35:35.927 --> 35:38.760
Lea, is there something
you want to tell me,

35:38.761 --> 35:41.400
something you failed to tell my colleagues?

35:42.036 --> 35:44.621
- What do you mean?
- Well, um,

35:46.361 --> 35:48.223
I just get the feeling that

35:48.224 --> 35:50.974
- you're not telling us everything.
- Of course I have.

35:51.111 --> 35:52.410
Why wouldn't I?

35:52.581 --> 35:55.457
Well, you told my colleagues
that you didn't know

35:55.458 --> 35:57.224
what your sister was writing about,

35:57.567 --> 35:59.963
or that she was dating Doctor Nielsen,

35:59.998 --> 36:02.926
or that they'd stopped seeing
each other a month ago, but

36:02.927 --> 36:05.361
we know she came and visited you everyday.

36:05.750 --> 36:07.614
We know how close you guys were.

36:08.832 --> 36:10.447
It just doesn't add up, does it?

36:11.537 --> 36:12.737
It's OK.

36:12.918 --> 36:15.649
Whatever it is, you can
tell me, I'll understand.

36:18.362 --> 36:20.095
There he is. Go!

36:33.454 --> 36:35.110
- Come on.
- Come on!

36:47.357 --> 36:48.877
I was afraid that

36:49.217 --> 36:50.417
they'd hurt me

36:50.576 --> 36:51.924
like they hurt her.

36:52.005 --> 36:53.915
Why? Has somebody threatened you?

36:54.826 --> 36:56.330
I've received this.

36:57.622 --> 36:58.822
Three days ago.

37:17.095 --> 37:18.859
I didn't know you were such a good driver.

37:19.392 --> 37:20.592
I'm not.

37:23.847 --> 37:26.158
Get around it. Get around it!

37:29.017 --> 37:30.217
OK.

37:30.246 --> 37:31.738
Go faster. Faster!

37:41.951 --> 37:43.151
Hands up.

37:44.852 --> 37:46.171
Put your hands up.

37:47.155 --> 37:48.579
Put your hands up!

37:54.326 --> 37:56.412
- Okay, you got him?
- No, I don't.

38:03.721 --> 38:05.135
Force them off the road.

38:10.292 --> 38:11.492
Shit!

38:58.516 --> 39:00.517
It's OK, Lea, it's OK.

39:00.594 --> 39:02.050
You're safe now.

39:06.790 --> 39:08.764
Arabela, where are you now?

39:08.765 --> 39:10.565
OK, we're at the bridge.

39:16.945 --> 39:18.996
- Watch out.
- We can make it.

39:18.997 --> 39:21.696
- No, we can't. Oh God.
- Yes, we can.

39:48.172 --> 39:49.578
A machine gun!

40:09.930 --> 40:11.388
Get out of the car!

40:12.762 --> 40:13.962
Now!

40:20.368 --> 40:21.826
Put your hands in the air!

40:23.867 --> 40:25.640
Put your hands in the air!

40:30.841 --> 40:32.985
_

40:32.986 --> 40:35.441
_

40:44.682 --> 40:46.971
You asked to see me, Mr. Dudayev?

40:50.013 --> 40:51.843
As you know, I'm

40:51.965 --> 40:54.139
facing some quite serious charges.

40:54.140 --> 40:55.340
You are.

40:55.683 --> 40:59.470
The authorities confiscated
rifles, grenades launchers and

40:59.590 --> 41:02.777
thousands upon thousands
of rounds of ammunition.

41:04.079 --> 41:06.753
This is something I did for my people.

41:07.733 --> 41:10.864
Let's make a deal and do
something for your people.

41:11.720 --> 41:14.038
I do not make deals.

41:14.267 --> 41:17.326
I'm disappointed in you, Mr. Dorn.

41:18.331 --> 41:22.066
I should think you of all people
would support our struggle.

41:22.067 --> 41:24.017
Nor do I take sides.

41:24.597 --> 41:26.230
I'm involved here

41:27.036 --> 41:30.526
because I deal with
crimes against humanity.

41:31.302 --> 41:33.354
Crimes against humanity?

41:33.776 --> 41:35.248
That's the point.

41:35.541 --> 41:38.677
They will judge me in
my country as a humanist.

41:39.101 --> 41:40.896
Mea culpa maxima.

41:41.260 --> 41:44.606
Here, you will judge me as a terrorist.

41:46.386 --> 41:48.831
That is another conversation, sir.

41:49.688 --> 41:51.761
You're a run of the mill criminal.

41:52.177 --> 41:54.470
A counterfeiter who has
flooded the hospitals

41:54.471 --> 41:56.671
of Europe with counterfeit medicine.

41:58.108 --> 42:00.431
Your revolution is over, sir.

42:00.946 --> 42:03.062
You are going to prison.

42:06.323 --> 42:09.839
A small price to pay to defeat injustice.

42:10.566 --> 42:13.011
You will never find the hospitals.

42:16.372 --> 42:19.496
The EMA has already instituted

42:20.175 --> 42:22.930
a total recall of those medicines.

42:24.700 --> 42:26.844
I will see you in court, sir.

42:41.538 --> 42:44.499
_

42:47.066 --> 42:48.266
Lea.

42:50.648 --> 42:52.399
This is Michel Dorn.

42:56.537 --> 42:57.938
Miss Jensen,

42:58.464 --> 43:02.018
your sister was a very courageous woman.

43:02.105 --> 43:03.564
Thank you, Mr. Dorn.

43:04.916 --> 43:08.161
Do you think Doctor Nielsen knew that
the medicine he gave me wouldn't work?

43:08.162 --> 43:10.655
- No.
- It wasn't until your sister

43:10.656 --> 43:14.810
started asking questions that he
realized what he had gotten into, and,

43:15.276 --> 43:17.784
by then, it was too late
for him to get out of it.

43:18.598 --> 43:20.594
It is my profound regret

43:21.223 --> 43:23.144
that we cannot undo

43:23.912 --> 43:26.718
the injustice that has
been done to you, and

43:27.147 --> 43:28.788
I am very sorry.

43:30.178 --> 43:31.546
I'm at peace with it.

43:32.315 --> 43:34.341
Freja was always the
one tilting at windmills

43:34.342 --> 43:36.438
trying to make the world a better place.

43:39.072 --> 43:42.051
- I'm ashamed of the way I acted.
- Oh, believe me,

43:42.423 --> 43:43.881
you of all people,

43:44.552 --> 43:46.400
have nothing to be ashamed of.

43:49.148 --> 43:50.387
I was afraid,

43:51.569 --> 43:53.867
I didn't tell Inspector Strand what I knew.

43:53.994 --> 43:57.825
You had every right to be afraid,
Lea. No one blames you for that.

43:58.563 --> 44:00.322
You just said that your sister

44:00.459 --> 44:02.815
was always tilting at windmills,

44:03.553 --> 44:04.828
not this time.

44:05.554 --> 44:06.754
This time,

44:07.816 --> 44:10.470
thousands of infirmed people
who would have suffered

44:10.471 --> 44:12.914
as you have suffered from
ingesting those pills.

44:14.413 --> 44:16.300
They've been saved because of her.

44:17.294 --> 44:18.565
Because of you.

44:22.772 --> 44:24.217
This is for her.
