WEBVTT

00:03.888 --> 00:05.088
This better be important, Jack.

00:05.155 --> 00:06.255
I was in the middle of bidding

00:06.323 --> 00:07.857
on a bag of bras on eBay.

00:07.925 --> 00:09.258
Lemon, Hank Hooper
is on his way

00:09.326 --> 00:10.359
up from Philadelphia,

00:10.427 --> 00:11.828
and he wants to meet
with both of us.

00:11.896 --> 00:12.896
Why does he want to meet me?

00:12.964 --> 00:14.163
Do you think it's a good thing?

00:14.231 --> 00:15.966
It's not, hon.

00:16.033 --> 00:17.266
I saw that in a movie once,

00:17.334 --> 00:19.268
but in the movie,
the guy was dead.

00:19.336 --> 00:20.769
Nice tie, Jack.

00:20.837 --> 00:23.005
How long have you been there?

00:23.073 --> 00:24.707
I was sitting in that chair
a minute ago.

00:24.774 --> 00:26.141
Nope.
That was me.

00:26.209 --> 00:28.176
What can I say?
I smell like leather.

00:28.244 --> 00:31.246
And you must be Elizabeth Lemon.

00:31.314 --> 00:33.015
Oh.

00:33.083 --> 00:34.083
Well, I'll be Bake McBrided.

00:34.150 --> 00:35.584
I know a Philly gal when I hug one.

00:35.651 --> 00:38.019
Now, Elizabeth, I like
to look someone in the eye

00:38.087 --> 00:41.122
and smile when I say that what
you're doing is bad.

00:41.189 --> 00:42.690
It's just horrible.

00:42.758 --> 00:45.893
Without Tracy, your show
is like my cholesterol.

00:45.961 --> 00:47.996
The numbers are killing me.

00:48.063 --> 00:49.764
So I'm gonna cancel <i>TGS.</i>

00:49.832 --> 00:51.398
Hank, as you know,

00:51.466 --> 00:54.300
tonight is <i>TGS's</i> 100th episode.

00:54.368 --> 00:56.903
And we've been getting
some good media buzz.

00:56.971 --> 00:58.371
Got on Wikipedia this week.

00:58.439 --> 01:01.675
So you did 99 shows
against all odds and reason.

01:01.743 --> 01:03.110
That's something.

01:03.177 --> 01:04.878
- Now it's time to rest.
- Really?

01:04.946 --> 01:06.847
You want to cancel the
only show on your network

01:06.914 --> 01:08.814
starring a 42-year-old woman?

01:08.882 --> 01:11.184
A show that is number one
in its time slot

01:11.252 --> 01:12.652
among men 18 to 49

01:12.719 --> 01:13.919
months left in prison?

01:13.987 --> 01:15.155
I thought this company was a family,

01:15.222 --> 01:17.157
but I guess it's that Austrian family

01:17.224 --> 01:18.358
and I am the girl in the basement,

01:18.425 --> 01:20.893
and you are the dad
who has been brutally--

01:20.961 --> 01:22.428
Thank you, Lemon.

01:22.496 --> 01:24.496
What Liz is neglecting to tell you

01:24.564 --> 01:26.632
is that Tracy Jordan is back.

01:26.699 --> 01:27.832
Oh.

01:27.900 --> 01:29.000
Well, that's something.

01:29.068 --> 01:30.469
And I would consider it
a personal favor

01:30.537 --> 01:32.504
if you would let them
do the 100th episode

01:32.572 --> 01:36.975
and then reevaluate
the show with Tracy in it.

01:37.043 --> 01:38.477
All right.

01:38.545 --> 01:39.778
You get one more shot.

01:39.845 --> 01:41.546
Just like the army doctor
said to me

01:41.613 --> 01:43.914
after my weekend in Okinawa.

01:45.517 --> 01:47.451
You know, Jack,
I'm amazed at how much

01:47.519 --> 01:50.354
you will stick your neck out
for your people.

01:50.422 --> 01:53.424
It's no wonder you're here with
us good folks at Kabletown

01:53.492 --> 01:54.925
instead of running GE.

01:54.993 --> 01:56.093
They're mean.

01:56.161 --> 01:57.860
Jack Welch once smacked a pretzel

01:57.928 --> 02:03.132
out of my hand at the Super Bowl.

02:03.201 --> 02:04.334
Is Tracy back?

02:04.402 --> 02:06.203
I'd hate to think I just lied to Hank.

02:06.270 --> 02:07.537
Geez, I'll get it done.

02:07.605 --> 02:09.172
You know I'll do whatever it takes.

02:09.240 --> 02:10.539
Lemon-style.

02:10.608 --> 02:12.974
♪ Everybody dance now ♪

02:14.511 --> 02:17.045

another sandwich

02:17.113 --> 02:18.880

your face up so bad

02:18.948 --> 02:19.981
you'll have a chin.

02:20.049 --> 02:21.650
I will waste you!

02:21.718 --> 02:24.453
You'll have to go through
this old bastard first.

02:24.521 --> 02:26.021
And I don't really
think it's fair

02:26.089 --> 02:29.557
for me to be on a jury
because I'm a hologram.

02:29.625 --> 02:30.858
What is the holdup with Tracy?

02:30.926 --> 02:32.059
I thought you found him.

02:32.127 --> 02:34.462
I did find him,
but he's still crazy.

02:34.530 --> 02:36.063
He thinks he can't be
funny anymore

02:36.131 --> 02:37.465
because now's a big Oscar winner.

02:37.533 --> 02:39.066
People respect him too much.

02:39.134 --> 02:42.803
He told me he feels like
a Bartram's Scrub-Hairstreak

02:42.871 --> 02:45.305
trying to crawl back
into its silky cocoon.

02:45.406 --> 02:47.807
Which is a butterfly metaphor,
by the way,

02:47.875 --> 02:49.276
and not, as I first thought,

02:49.344 --> 02:50.877
a list of African-American
hair pduducts.

02:50.945 --> 02:52.879
Well you just need to turn
the beautiful butterfly

02:52.947 --> 02:55.382
back into  a drunk,
incompetent caterpillar.

02:55.450 --> 02:56.750
And I have a plan.

02:56.784 --> 02:58.518
I booked him on every morning
show in New York.

02:58.586 --> 03:01.920
Traci will destroy all his
goodwill in time for rehearsal.

03:01.988 --> 03:03.589
I've been prepping him all week.

03:03.690 --> 03:05.358
So, Tracy Jordan,

03:05.425 --> 03:07.826
My wife Joey and I were
in Maralago--

03:07.927 --> 03:10.429
Jesus was black!

03:10.464 --> 03:12.131
Just get him back
in time for the show.

03:12.198 --> 03:13.499
I have a very full plate.

03:13.567 --> 03:15.200
Really?
Is it from that pie place?

03:15.269 --> 03:16.368
And I'm tired of going to bat

03:16.435 --> 03:17.369
for you and your show.

03:17.436 --> 03:20.004
Oh, okay.
Fine.

03:20.072 --> 03:21.139
But just to be clear--

03:21.206 --> 03:22.140
There is no pie.

03:22.207 --> 03:24.108
Okay.

Congratulations, everyone.

In 100 shows,
we've done Pam 107 times.

03:58.976 --> 04:00.777
Can you believe it's been five years

04:00.845 --> 04:02.545
since we first started doing this?

04:02.613 --> 04:03.980
Um, that wasn't me.

04:04.048 --> 04:05.347
There used to be another guy.

04:05.415 --> 04:06.481
I don't think so.

04:06.549 --> 04:09.084
Happy 100th show, miss Maroney.

04:09.152 --> 04:10.186
Danny and I were just talking about

04:10.253 --> 04:11.987
what an amazing five years we've had.

04:12.055 --> 04:16.325
I will choke you to death
with your boyfriend's wig!

04:16.392 --> 04:18.160
Give me back my man, bitch!

04:18.228 --> 04:19.461
Can you reminisce about something

04:19.529 --> 04:20.862
that's happened since I've been here,

04:20.930 --> 04:22.396
'cause I couldn't see any of that.

04:22.464 --> 04:23.932
I'll never forget what you said to me

04:23.999 --> 04:26.134
after that first show, miss Maroney.

04:26.202 --> 04:27.601
Terrific show, ma'am.

04:27.669 --> 04:29.704
If I know anything about television,

04:29.771 --> 04:31.206
<i>The Girlie Show</i> is a hit.

04:31.273 --> 04:32.273
Oh, please.

04:32.341 --> 04:33.541
If this turkey goes 100 episodes,

04:33.608 --> 04:35.543
I'll have your baby.

04:35.610 --> 04:36.877
I said that?

04:36.945 --> 04:38.478
I was so young.

04:38.546 --> 04:39.779
Wait. I saw that.

04:39.848 --> 04:41.448
How? Am I dead?

04:41.515 --> 04:43.783
Well, it's been 100 episodes.

04:43.852 --> 04:45.719
I better lay you across my
grandmother's lap

04:45.786 --> 04:47.054
in the mating shed.

04:48.389 --> 04:49.622
But seriously, imagine if Jenna

04:49.690 --> 04:50.891
really was a mother.

04:50.959 --> 04:52.759
It would be horrible.

04:52.827 --> 04:54.626
The only thing I want latched
to my funbags

04:54.694 --> 04:56.062
are celebrity DJs.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.263
I don't know, miss Maroney.

04:57.331 --> 04:58.931
I think you'd make a wonderful parent.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.300
You could sing the baby to sleep

05:01.368 --> 05:04.203
and tell it fairy tales and
act out all the witch parts.

05:04.271 --> 05:08.574
You're serious?
You albino goon.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.842
I wish.
Albinos get to be watchers

05:10.910 --> 05:14.612
in the mating shed.

05:14.680 --> 05:17.448
I can't even imagine you pregnant.

05:17.516 --> 05:18.816
A picture of you in <i>Us Weekly</i>

05:18.885 --> 05:20.852
next to Natalie Portman
in the same maternity outfit.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.187
"Who wore it best?"

05:22.255 --> 05:25.055
I did.
I wore it best.

05:25.123 --> 05:27.958
A baby gets you attention.

05:28.026 --> 05:29.493
Listen up, friends.

05:29.560 --> 05:30.794
It's pep talk time.

05:30.862 --> 05:32.829
I'm not gonna sugarcoat anything here.

05:32.898 --> 05:34.398
If we don't get Tracy back

05:34.465 --> 05:36.967
and do the best show
that we've ever done,

05:37.035 --> 05:39.036
we're cancelled.

05:39.104 --> 05:41.871
So we're counting on Tracy?

05:41.939 --> 05:43.639
Forget it.

05:43.707 --> 05:46.009
Frank, put that hat back on.

05:46.076 --> 05:49.645
Look, we've been through
bad times before.

05:49.713 --> 05:50.713
All right.

05:52.116 --> 05:53.950
Ride it straight to hell!

05:54.018 --> 05:55.151
Here come the roofies.

05:55.219 --> 05:57.819
Where's my Mac and cheese?

05:57.887 --> 06:00.822
And we've had some good times.

06:00.890 --> 06:03.525
Who wants--
my puddings!

06:05.395 --> 06:08.030
And I know what you are
all capable of.

06:08.097 --> 06:09.864
This is your moment.

06:09.933 --> 06:14.135
Tonight, <i>TGS</i> will not be
the worst thing on television.

06:14.202 --> 06:16.438
It'll be John Stossel.

06:16.505 --> 06:17.705
Who's with me?

06:17.773 --> 06:18.840
Yeah!

06:18.908 --> 06:19.841
Let's do it.

06:19.909 --> 06:20.942
Good job.

06:30.718 --> 06:32.286
Gas leak, huh?

06:32.354 --> 06:33.620
Great.

06:33.688 --> 06:34.655
Damn it.

06:34.722 --> 06:36.123
Why now?

06:36.191 --> 06:37.825
On my last day before retirement.

06:37.892 --> 06:40.627
Here. Let me show you guys something.

06:40.695 --> 06:42.863
That's my girl.

06:42.931 --> 06:44.198
We're getting married
when I get out of here.

06:44.266 --> 06:46.132
Why am I showing you guys this?

06:46.200 --> 06:47.633
It's gonna jinx everything.

06:47.701 --> 06:48.868
Plus you're a couple of pervs.

06:50.972 --> 06:52.105
Should be all right
as long as the leak

06:52.173 --> 06:53.506
doesn't get into--

06:53.574 --> 06:55.775
ah, damn it.
Look at this.

06:55.843 --> 06:58.144
It's going right into
the sixth floor air duct.

06:58.212 --> 06:59.446
Damn it again!

06:59.513 --> 07:01.881
Well, we're gonna have
to evacuate the sixth

07:01.949 --> 07:03.115
until this thing's taken care of.

07:03.183 --> 07:05.617
Who's up there?
<i>TGS?</i>

07:05.685 --> 07:07.453
Isn't that show already
half-dead?

07:11.291 --> 07:12.557
Who wants to kiss?

07:12.625 --> 07:14.559
What do you say we get
some fresh air?

07:19.519 --> 07:21.919
Jack, we´ve a problem- There's
a gas leak in the studio.

07:21.987 --> 07:23.320
Do you know what
I find fascinating?

07:23.388 --> 07:25.022
Mystery novels
written by janitors?

07:25.090 --> 07:26.691
How everyone who comes
through my door

07:26.758 --> 07:28.759
seems to want to talk about <i>TGS</i>

07:28.827 --> 07:31.261
as if it's also
the only thing in my life.

07:31.329 --> 07:32.763
Now, I may not be the head of ge,

07:32.831 --> 07:34.865
but that doesn't mean
I'm not a very busy man.

07:34.933 --> 07:36.800
I've got other things going
on too, you know.

07:36.867 --> 07:38.101
See?
I got a new hair.

07:38.169 --> 07:39.803
It's white and it hurts,
but--

07:39.870 --> 07:40.870
How bad is this leak?

07:40.938 --> 07:42.172
It's pretty bad.

07:42.239 --> 07:44.640
Prolonged exposure
could lead to incapacitation

07:44.709 --> 07:46.076
or even death.

07:46.143 --> 07:48.444
Other possible side effects include

07:48.512 --> 07:50.346
hallucinations, revelation of secrets,

07:50.414 --> 07:53.348
telling of truths, flashbacks,

07:53.416 --> 07:56.185
headaches, nostalgia.

07:57.553 --> 07:58.687
Can you believe this is
happening to me

07:58.755 --> 07:59.722
on my last day of work?

07:59.789 --> 08:01.156
My last day.

08:01.224 --> 08:02.424
I don't know if there
was a party planned--

08:02.491 --> 08:04.426
Evacuate the sixth floor.

08:04.493 --> 08:06.095
I don't care if anyone dies.

08:06.162 --> 08:08.730
I refuse to have long,
gas-induced conversations

08:08.797 --> 08:10.164
with any of you people.

08:10.232 --> 08:11.799
Boy, you know,
over the past five years,

08:11.867 --> 08:14.268
we've had a lot of crazy characters

08:14.336 --> 08:16.204
and guest stars drop by <i>TGS.</i>

08:16.271 --> 08:19.506
Thank you, Pete.

08:19.574 --> 08:22.009
Thank you, Pete.

08:24.512 --> 08:27.214
I can't believe it's been 100 shows.

08:27.282 --> 08:29.149
More like 100 little strokes.

08:31.953 --> 08:34.221
You know, <i>The Girlie Show</i>
was working just fine,

08:34.289 --> 08:36.857
and then Jack came along
and forced me to hire Tracy,

08:36.924 --> 08:38.024
and now look at us.

08:38.092 --> 08:40.394
Oh, life was so much simpler
back then.

08:40.462 --> 08:42.227
I had a boyfriend.
Dennis.

08:42.296 --> 08:43.895
Sure, he was an idiot,
but he made great chili,

08:43.964 --> 08:45.798
and he didn't care
if I watched TV during sex.

08:47.735 --> 08:50.169
Yeah, maybe I was better off then.

08:53.574 --> 08:54.874
Liz, we have to evacuate the floor.

08:54.941 --> 08:56.342
There's a gas leak.

08:56.410 --> 08:57.643
What?
What about the show?

08:57.710 --> 08:59.944
Everyone, evacuate immediately.

09:00.012 --> 09:01.012
This is not a drill.

09:01.080 --> 09:03.014
The gas is not affecting me yet,

09:03.082 --> 09:04.783
so I can lead you to safety.

09:04.850 --> 09:07.386
Just follow these...
Troll penises!

09:07.453 --> 09:11.390
Oh, God!
What have I done?

09:11.457 --> 09:13.424
He is an Oscar winner for his role

09:13.492 --> 09:17.027
as D'Jeffrey "Lucky" Seeda in
the movie <i>Hard to Watch.</i>

09:18.797 --> 09:21.031
Please welcome Tracy Jordan.

09:23.935 --> 09:25.369
Tracy!

09:25.437 --> 09:26.771
Tracy.

09:26.838 --> 09:27.905
Tracy?

09:27.972 --> 09:29.273
Why don't you shut your mouth,

09:29.340 --> 09:31.240
back that ass up
and make me a sandwich?

09:31.309 --> 09:32.509
He's awesome.

09:32.576 --> 09:34.444
You are still in character

09:34.512 --> 09:36.579
as the verbally abusive D'Jeffrey.

09:36.647 --> 09:39.382
I mean, he's become
such a part of him.

09:39.450 --> 09:40.750
So, Tracy Jordan.

09:40.818 --> 09:42.919
You asked to come on our show

09:42.986 --> 09:44.354
because you had a revelation

09:44.422 --> 09:46.689
about your post-Oscar
trip to Africa.

09:46.756 --> 09:48.390
I lied to all you ugly white ladies.

09:48.458 --> 09:49.758
I didn't go to Africa.

09:49.826 --> 09:51.627
I was hiding in a warehouse in Queens,

09:51.695 --> 09:53.529
watching vintage pornography.

09:53.596 --> 09:54.797
I love your honesty.

09:57.099 --> 09:58.900
It's because you didn't feel

09:58.968 --> 10:01.469
like your authentic self

10:01.537 --> 10:03.971
that you walked away from success.

10:04.039 --> 10:06.273
That's actually very brave.
Don't you think?

10:06.342 --> 10:07.908
No! It's unbrave!

10:07.976 --> 10:09.744
- You should hate me!
- I can't.

10:09.812 --> 10:12.213
You fly free.

10:12.280 --> 10:13.581
I'm a bird in a cage.

10:13.649 --> 10:14.982
Hey, you got to stay around.

10:15.050 --> 10:17.917
We've got our no-cook cooking,
hair make-unders.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.285
What does that even mean?

10:19.354 --> 10:20.620
It's new haircuts,

10:20.688 --> 10:22.322
but you can make salads with them.

10:26.060 --> 10:28.194
A true artist...

10:28.262 --> 10:30.029
He feels things we don't.

10:30.097 --> 10:32.599
This is <i>Today</i> on NBC.

10:32.667 --> 10:34.900
No, we can't do another Pam.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.335
Not tonight.

10:36.403 --> 10:37.436
Frank, what is this?

10:37.504 --> 10:39.004
"Broken eyboard alk show"?

10:39.072 --> 10:40.038
I write what I know.

10:40.106 --> 10:42.107
Also I broke my keyboard.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.509
No, we're throwing everything out

10:43.577 --> 10:44.877
and starting over.

10:44.944 --> 10:47.813
Only home runs, guys.
Focus up.

10:47.881 --> 10:48.881
It's just hard to concentrate.

10:48.948 --> 10:50.382
It's so nice working outside.

10:55.388 --> 10:56.421
Tracy, how'd it go?

10:56.489 --> 10:57.455
Are you on your way back?

10:57.523 --> 10:58.990
It was a disaster!

10:59.057 --> 11:00.525
What happened?
What about our plan?

11:00.593 --> 11:02.460
I'm so beloved, I can do no wrong.

11:02.528 --> 11:04.295
Now everyone's after me.

11:04.363 --> 11:06.697
Unicef, the Gates foundation.

11:06.765 --> 11:08.064
And what is Farm Aid?

11:08.132 --> 11:10.567
Is it a drink?
Is it a drug?

11:10.635 --> 11:12.669
Is it a bandage you put on a barn?

11:12.737 --> 11:14.438
See, that's the kind of
lazy stand-up

11:14.506 --> 11:15.839
I'll never do again.

11:15.907 --> 11:17.908
Tracy, just come back,
do the show tonight,

11:17.975 --> 11:19.376
and we'll figure all this out.

11:19.444 --> 11:21.044
F-u, l.l.

11:21.112 --> 11:24.781
Spells "full," because you're
full of BS, Liz Lemon.

11:24.848 --> 11:26.482
Listen to me.
There's still time.

11:26.550 --> 11:28.418
The media won't let you
embarrass yourself.

11:28.485 --> 11:31.153
Be like Michael McDonald
and take it to the streets.

11:31.221 --> 11:33.122
Get the public to hate you,
and the media will follow.

11:33.189 --> 11:34.524
And then you'll get
your old life back.

11:34.591 --> 11:35.591
Trust me.

11:35.659 --> 11:37.359
You better be right, Liz Lemon,

11:37.427 --> 11:40.094
'cause I can't take much more of this.

11:40.162 --> 11:43.097
I think Bono got in my limo.

11:46.402 --> 11:48.269
Liz!

11:48.337 --> 11:49.805
Do you think I'd be a good mother?

11:50.940 --> 11:52.173
No.

11:52.241 --> 11:53.974
And I wasn't even drinking anything.

11:54.042 --> 11:55.375
I just feel like I'm
at a point in my life

11:55.444 --> 11:56.744
where I'm starting to have
this real desire

11:56.812 --> 11:58.378
to nurture... my career.

11:58.447 --> 12:00.213
I think pregnancy would
be a great PR move.

12:00.281 --> 12:01.281
Oh, my God.

12:01.349 --> 12:03.250
You want a baby to help your career?

12:03.318 --> 12:05.385
Look... <i>TGS</i> may be going away.

12:05.454 --> 12:07.421
Being pregnant is a great excuse
for why I stopped working

12:07.489 --> 12:08.489
instead of the truth.

12:08.557 --> 12:09.989
I'm in my 40s, very difficult,

12:10.057 --> 12:13.960
and not that good
at playing <i>La Realite.</i>

12:14.027 --> 12:15.061
Jenna, think about this.

12:15.128 --> 12:16.295
You will have a child.

12:16.363 --> 12:18.064
Who will grow up to be
a little gay fancy man.

12:18.131 --> 12:19.766
Well, good luck finding
a man willing to ride

12:19.834 --> 12:21.233
that crazy train.

12:21.301 --> 12:22.969
I'll have you know I talked
with a man this morning

12:23.036 --> 12:24.604
who thinks I'd be a wonderful mother.

12:24.672 --> 12:27.405
He must be an idiot.

12:27.474 --> 12:31.276
He is an idiot.

12:31.344 --> 12:32.878
What about a sketch

12:32.946 --> 12:34.212
about how the Empire State building

12:34.280 --> 12:35.914
is controlling us with electricity?

12:35.982 --> 12:38.383
Come on, get out of here.

12:44.990 --> 12:47.291
Just maybe one more turn.

12:47.359 --> 12:49.460
Then I can go home to my sweetheart.

12:49.528 --> 12:51.195
I told her boy I'd hit a home run

12:51.262 --> 12:52.797
for him tomorrow night.

12:52.865 --> 12:54.632
Here we go.

12:57.635 --> 12:58.535
Damn it!

12:58.636 --> 12:59.870
I'm getting too old for this

12:59.937 --> 13:02.205
"shh" sound that comes
from this gas pipe.

13:11.716 --> 13:12.682
Who are you?

13:12.750 --> 13:14.182
You're so handsome.

13:14.250 --> 13:17.786
I'm Jack Donaghy,
CEO of General Electric.

13:17.854 --> 13:20.022
Who are you?

13:20.089 --> 13:21.289
I'm Jack Donaghy.

13:21.357 --> 13:22.691
You <i>were</i> Jack Donaghy.

13:22.759 --> 13:24.627
You <i>were</i> magnificent.

13:24.694 --> 13:27.295
- I'm still magnificent.
- No.

13:27.363 --> 13:29.231
I come from an alternate universe

13:29.298 --> 13:31.266
in which I followed our plan

13:31.334 --> 13:32.534
for world domination.

13:32.601 --> 13:33.968
I run the general.

13:34.037 --> 13:35.870
I own an NFL team.

13:35.938 --> 13:37.672
I guest-starred on <i>Entourage.</i>

13:37.740 --> 13:38.940
What do you do?

13:39.008 --> 13:40.509
I'll tell you what I don't do.

13:40.576 --> 13:42.644
Wear a striped tie
with a striped shirt.

13:42.711 --> 13:44.546
It's called "Power Clashing"

13:44.613 --> 13:46.280
and I do it because I can.

13:46.348 --> 13:48.749
I wore this on the January cover

13:48.816 --> 13:50.518
of <i>Meetings</i> magazine.

13:50.585 --> 13:53.054
We made the cover during
<i>meetings</i> history month?

13:53.121 --> 13:55.689
<i>I</i> made the cover.

13:55.757 --> 13:57.824
What happened to you, Jack?

13:57.892 --> 14:00.261
You were supposed
to spend six months in tv

14:00.328 --> 14:02.762
as part of your climb
up the GE ladder.

14:02.829 --> 14:04.330
You've been here five years.

14:04.398 --> 14:06.366
And here...

14:06.434 --> 14:08.034
Isn't even GE anymore.

14:08.102 --> 14:09.269
It's Kableclown.

14:09.336 --> 14:11.504
"Town," Donaghy, and that's not funny.

14:11.572 --> 14:12.805
It was funny when I said it

14:12.873 --> 14:14.174
on my syndicated radio show.

14:14.241 --> 14:15.275
You bastard.

14:15.342 --> 14:16.342
I'm doing fine!

14:16.410 --> 14:18.010
You used to be a shark.

14:18.078 --> 14:20.011
I still am.
Look at my claws!

14:20.080 --> 14:21.947
Sharks don't have claws.

14:22.014 --> 14:23.915
You don't even know
what a shark is anymore!

14:23.983 --> 14:25.684
Oh, God.

14:25.751 --> 14:28.087
Do you know why?

14:28.154 --> 14:29.088
No.

14:29.155 --> 14:31.756
Liz... Lemon.

14:31.824 --> 14:33.725
Lemon?

14:33.793 --> 14:35.460
She became your focus

14:35.527 --> 14:37.861
at the expense of
your own ambition.

14:37.929 --> 14:39.830
You should have
realized within a week

14:39.898 --> 14:41.031
that Lemon was a black hole,

14:41.100 --> 14:43.634
unworthy of our mentorship.

14:43.702 --> 14:45.869
And now it's five years later,
and what are you doing?

14:45.937 --> 14:48.406
Are you building factories
in bangalore?

14:48.474 --> 14:51.074
Are you dining
in the Palin White House?

14:51.142 --> 14:52.542
No.

14:52.610 --> 14:55.712
You're approving
<i>TGS</i> wrap gifts.

14:55.779 --> 14:59.282
Baseball caps with stupid
sayings from the show

14:59.350 --> 15:00.517
written on them.

15:00.585 --> 15:02.219
What the hell is a "Pwomp"?

15:02.286 --> 15:03.686
It's when two fat people--

15:03.754 --> 15:05.555
I don't care!

15:05.623 --> 15:07.156
What's happened to you?

15:07.224 --> 15:08.790
To us?

15:08.858 --> 15:10.926
We make me sick.

15:10.994 --> 15:12.595
Mr. Donaghy?

15:12.662 --> 15:13.895
- What?
- Yes, Tom?

15:13.963 --> 15:15.296
The gas leak has
spread to this floor.

15:15.364 --> 15:17.298
You got to clear out before
you start seeing things.

15:17.366 --> 15:18.900
- Thank you, tom.
- I'll clear you out!

15:18.968 --> 15:20.535
Oh, okay.

15:24.440 --> 15:25.774
The real Jack Donaghy

15:25.842 --> 15:28.209
could handle a little gas leak!

15:34.279 --> 15:37.779
I am a Jedi!

15:38.629 --> 15:39.730
Hey, look.

15:39.797 --> 15:41.832
Tracy Jordan is
ironically reappropriating

15:41.899 --> 15:44.267
his bad past behavior
as a commentary

15:44.335 --> 15:46.202
on Fitzgerald's dictum that
there are no second acts

15:46.270 --> 15:47.370
in American life.

15:47.404 --> 15:48.571
I want to take a picture of him

15:48.638 --> 15:49.638
with my old-fashioned camera.

15:49.706 --> 15:50.639
- No! No!
- Ah!

15:51.708 --> 15:53.376
Help!
I can't swim!

15:53.443 --> 15:54.710
Damn it!

15:54.778 --> 15:56.311
He just pulled me out
of the water and said,

15:56.380 --> 15:58.748
"Don't tell anyone I did this."

15:58.815 --> 16:00.215
I didn't even get a chance
to congratulate him

16:00.283 --> 16:01.717
on his Oscar.

16:01.785 --> 16:03.651
Modesty and heroism.

16:03.719 --> 16:06.855
Two words forever synonymous
with Tracy Jordan.

16:06.922 --> 16:10.091
"Tracy Jordan saves drowning man"?

16:10.158 --> 16:12.260
Ah, come on!

16:12.327 --> 16:13.828
Why is Tracy off rescuing people?

16:13.896 --> 16:14.896
Why isn't he here?

16:14.963 --> 16:16.163
He will be, I promise.

16:16.231 --> 16:17.265
And we need to be ready.

16:17.332 --> 16:18.499
Lutz, what are you working on?

16:18.566 --> 16:19.733
Breathing through my mouth

16:19.801 --> 16:21.067
so I don't smell
the throw-up on s shirt.

16:22.136 --> 16:23.203
I would take my shirt off,

16:23.271 --> 16:24.204
but I visited my rescue chimp

16:24.272 --> 16:25.906
for his birthday last week,

16:25.973 --> 16:28.675
and another chimp got mad
and bit my nipple off.

16:28.743 --> 16:29.777
He played with it,

16:29.844 --> 16:30.778
and then he kissed it,

16:30.845 --> 16:32.279
and then he ate it.

16:32.346 --> 16:33.814
Damn it, lutz.
Focus up.

16:33.882 --> 16:35.782
Where's my computer?

16:35.849 --> 16:37.784
Cerie, did you not
bring my computer down?

16:37.851 --> 16:39.018
You said you were writing.

16:39.085 --> 16:40.386
I've only seen you use that computer

16:40.454 --> 16:41.954
to look at pictures of Nate Berkus.

16:42.022 --> 16:44.457
Ah! Pwomp!

16:44.525 --> 16:46.526
Hey, Jack, you're friends

16:46.593 --> 16:47.993
with Jeter and Springsteen, right?

16:48.061 --> 16:50.029
Can you call and see if
they'll be in the cold open?

16:50.096 --> 16:51.129
They'd have to kiss.

16:51.196 --> 16:52.531
Oh, really, Lemon?

16:52.598 --> 16:53.832
You still need my help?

16:53.900 --> 16:55.867
Five years of my business life wasted,

16:55.935 --> 16:57.836
and I'm still supposed
to hold your hand.

16:57.904 --> 17:00.204
Your wet, yet somehow flaky hand.

17:00.272 --> 17:01.907
- What just happened?
- You happened.

17:01.974 --> 17:03.475
Sideways Jack was right.

17:03.543 --> 17:04.643
Sideways what?

17:04.710 --> 17:07.645
In here!

17:07.712 --> 17:10.280
Did you also have
to evacuate the NBC Store?

17:10.348 --> 17:12.115
No, it's just empty.

17:12.183 --> 17:13.884
This TV nonsense

17:13.952 --> 17:15.252
was supposed to be
my stepping stone,

17:15.319 --> 17:17.387
and instead, it's my gravestone.

17:17.455 --> 17:18.955
And do you know
whose fault that is?

17:19.022 --> 17:20.657
Sort of feel like
you're gonna say Leno.

17:20.724 --> 17:21.826
You.

17:21.893 --> 17:23.992
I got so sucked
into trying to repair you

17:24.060 --> 17:25.994
that I became
the American auto industry,

17:26.063 --> 17:28.598
failing to recognize
that you can't fix a <i>Lemon</i>

17:28.666 --> 17:29.966
Wow, yeah,
because the last five years

17:30.033 --> 17:32.469
have been so great for me
with you as my mentor.

17:32.536 --> 17:34.337
I was better off before we met.

17:34.404 --> 17:35.505
So what's your point, Lemon?

17:35.573 --> 17:37.239
You'd rather be doing <i>The Girlie Show</i>

17:37.307 --> 17:38.341
and going home to Dennis?

17:38.408 --> 17:39.608
I didn't say that.

17:39.676 --> 17:41.076
But at least Dennis was always
there for me.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.778
He's the only guy
I can say that about.

17:42.846 --> 17:44.713
I dragged you down?

17:44.781 --> 17:45.814
Opposite!

17:45.882 --> 17:47.115
I should have gone with my gut

17:47.183 --> 17:48.316
and fired you when we first met.

17:48.384 --> 17:50.919
What?
Flashback, please.

17:50.987 --> 17:52.020
Uh, Pete, hang back.

17:52.088 --> 17:56.123
Yeah, you bet.

17:56.191 --> 17:57.157
We have a problem.

17:57.225 --> 17:58.659
I can explain.
My zipper broke.

17:58.727 --> 18:00.862
I don't think Liz Lemon's
female voice

18:00.929 --> 18:02.463
is a good match for Tracy Jordan.

18:02.531 --> 18:05.032
Firing Lemon will send a
message to the whole staff.

18:05.100 --> 18:06.400
No, no, you can't fire Liz.

18:06.468 --> 18:07.668
This show is her life.

18:07.736 --> 18:08.836
She hasn't got much going on.

18:08.904 --> 18:10.871
She threw a birthday
party for her TV.

18:10.938 --> 18:12.839
If you fire Liz,
then--

18:12.907 --> 18:14.307
then I quit.

18:14.375 --> 18:16.075
You'll never succeed
by sticking your neck out

18:16.143 --> 18:17.276
for someone like her.

18:17.344 --> 18:19.445
But if that's how you feel,
so be it.

18:19.514 --> 18:23.016
The important thing
is that I fire someone...

18:23.083 --> 18:24.117
Pete.

18:24.184 --> 18:25.719
You tried to fire me?

18:25.786 --> 18:26.785
And then a week later,
you're like,

18:26.853 --> 18:28.587
"oh, I want to mentor you."

18:28.655 --> 18:29.922
"Unlikely friendship."

18:29.990 --> 18:31.023
Who do you think you are?

18:31.090 --> 18:32.290
I'll tell you who I was.

18:32.358 --> 18:33.626
That guy that fired Pete.

18:33.693 --> 18:35.160
And he could have run GE,

18:35.228 --> 18:37.563
but instead, he got lemoned.

18:37.631 --> 18:39.999
I should have fired
you from my life.

18:42.135 --> 18:43.467
I knew you were supposed to push,

18:43.536 --> 18:45.336
but I didn't say anything.

18:45.404 --> 18:46.971
Ugh.

18:50.175 --> 18:51.442
Mmm.

18:51.510 --> 18:53.344
The MSG is delicious today.

18:53.412 --> 18:55.413
I'm so glad that you're able
to meet me on my break.

18:55.480 --> 18:57.815
Is this just to talk,
or will you be activating

18:57.883 --> 18:58.982
my electric underwear?

18:59.050 --> 19:00.183
Just to talk.

19:00.251 --> 19:02.819
Paul, do you think
I'd be a good mother?

19:02.887 --> 19:05.155
Of course not.
And I'd be a terrible father.

19:05.222 --> 19:06.289
I mean, what if we had a child

19:06.357 --> 19:07.624
that was prettier than us?

19:07.692 --> 19:08.825
We'd have to leave it in a desert.

19:08.893 --> 19:10.561
But Kenneth thinks
I'd make a good mother.

19:10.628 --> 19:12.128
Oh.

19:12.196 --> 19:13.664
Is that something you want?

19:13.731 --> 19:15.230
Wasn't something I thought about

19:15.298 --> 19:17.967
until Kenneth said I'd be good at it.

19:18.035 --> 19:20.402
And of course,
it'd be great for my career.

19:20.470 --> 19:22.638
Everyone would talk
about my crazy name choice.

19:22.706 --> 19:25.074
Right now, it's between
"Frisbeeface" and "Glock,"

19:25.141 --> 19:27.409
gender irrelevant.

19:27.477 --> 19:28.978
I love you, Jenna Maroney.

19:29.046 --> 19:31.145
I want to hogtie you and hide you

19:31.213 --> 19:32.814
in the luggage compartment
of a Greyhound bus

19:32.882 --> 19:34.215
with just a bowl of dirty water.

19:34.283 --> 19:35.984
I love you too.

19:36.052 --> 19:37.185
But I don't know.

19:37.252 --> 19:38.519
I mean, Kenneth Parcell
may be the only man

19:38.588 --> 19:40.521
in the world who thinks you
should have a child.

19:40.590 --> 19:41.723
Break's over, Paul.

19:41.791 --> 19:43.257
Crew meeting in
Lady Chantarelle's office.

19:43.325 --> 19:46.561
He's pissed.

19:48.663 --> 19:50.864
- Hey, dummy.
- Gah! What?

19:50.932 --> 19:52.399
Whoa.
You look good.

19:52.467 --> 19:53.734
You lose weight or something?

19:53.802 --> 19:55.268
Your neck, it looks looser.

19:55.336 --> 19:56.637
What are you doing here, Dennis?

19:56.705 --> 19:58.739
I got your message.

19:58.807 --> 20:01.742
What message?

20:07.380 --> 20:08.447
Dennis, it's dummy.

20:08.515 --> 20:09.749
I miss you.

20:09.817 --> 20:10.950
Come see me.

20:14.655 --> 20:16.789
Things were better
five years ago, Jack.

20:16.857 --> 20:19.791
I was in my 30s and everything.

20:27.967 --> 20:30.002
Whazzup!

20:30.069 --> 20:31.837
You've reached Dennis' voicemail.

20:31.904 --> 20:33.005
"How you doing?"

20:33.072 --> 20:34.439
Get out of here, Joey.

20:34.507 --> 20:35.740
I'm recording
my voicemail message.

20:37.009 --> 20:38.275
Is that real?

20:38.343 --> 20:39.844
Okay, I did call you,

20:39.911 --> 20:40.978
but I was not in my right mind.

20:41.046 --> 20:42.212
I mean, how could I be,

20:42.280 --> 20:43.981
to call you after everything
you've done?

20:44.049 --> 20:45.249
Good evening, sir.

20:45.316 --> 20:46.951
I'm Chris Hansen
with <i>Dateline NBC.</i>

20:47.019 --> 20:48.686
Can I ask you what you're
doing here tonight?

20:48.754 --> 20:50.621
Yeah, I'm here to boff some
chick named Mary.

20:50.688 --> 20:53.089
Hey... threesome?

20:53.157 --> 20:54.157
How about it, huh?

20:54.224 --> 20:55.258
It's Tonya, right?

20:55.325 --> 20:56.826
It's wonderful service.

20:56.894 --> 21:00.163
Could you maybe not hit
on the waitress in front--

21:00.230 --> 21:01.998
Chew and screw!
Run, dummy.

21:02.066 --> 21:04.134
Ah!
Damn it, Dennis!

21:04.201 --> 21:05.802
I checked a coat.

21:05.870 --> 21:07.670
But you called me, Liz.

21:07.704 --> 21:08.771
Oh, whatever.

21:08.838 --> 21:09.872
'Cause down deep, you still got

21:09.939 --> 21:11.707
all kinds of queer
feelings for me.

21:11.775 --> 21:14.276
That's why I knew someday
you'd be all vulnerable

21:14.343 --> 21:16.812
from a gas leak or a coma
or a super period.

21:16.880 --> 21:17.846
You're disgusting.

21:17.914 --> 21:19.014
And I would be there for you.

21:19.082 --> 21:21.650
No. You know what I feel?

21:21.718 --> 21:22.784
You were a mistake

21:22.851 --> 21:24.185
that I made at a time in my life

21:24.252 --> 21:26.054
when I could afford
to make mistakes.

21:26.121 --> 21:27.855
That's what I miss,
Dennis, not you.

21:27.923 --> 21:29.323
Okay, gang, they fixed
the gas leak.

21:29.391 --> 21:30.624
They're airing out the studio.

21:30.692 --> 21:32.293
We can start heading back up.

21:32.360 --> 21:33.827
Whoa, hold on a second.

21:33.895 --> 21:35.796
You think I'm just gonna
give up now, huh?

21:35.863 --> 21:38.465
I'm a Duffy, Liz
and us Duffys,

21:38.533 --> 21:40.234
we didn't give up when we got
kicked out of Ireland.

21:40.302 --> 21:42.035
We didn't give up
when America sent us back.

21:42.103 --> 21:43.804
And we didn't give up when Ireland

21:43.871 --> 21:45.972
then just set us adrift
on a log, all right?

21:46.040 --> 21:48.575
Come on, it's not over, Liz.

21:51.340 --> 21:52.475
What a day!

21:53.590 --> 21:55.323
Miss Lemon's gonna
get Mr. Jordan back.

21:55.391 --> 21:56.991
We're gonna do the best show ever.

21:57.059 --> 21:58.426
And out on the Plaza,

21:58.494 --> 22:00.562
a bird landed on my apple.

22:00.629 --> 22:03.365
I thought he was gonna eat it,
but he just sat there.

22:03.432 --> 22:04.833
What's next?

22:04.900 --> 22:07.736
A different bird landing
on a different apple?

22:10.505 --> 22:11.705
Where are you, Tray?

22:11.773 --> 22:13.907
- I'm back, Liz Lemon.
- Tracy's back!!

22:13.975 --> 22:15.275
- Yeah!
- Yes!

22:15.343 --> 22:16.377
I'm gonna need
an Obama cold open,

22:16.444 --> 22:17.745
a fart doctor, and you know what?

22:17.812 --> 22:19.079
Write up that bum's
Empire State building idea.

22:19.146 --> 22:20.947
Fart doctor.

22:21.015 --> 22:22.883
No, I mean I'm back
to where I was yesterday.

22:22.950 --> 22:24.551
I can't get anyone mad at me.

22:24.619 --> 22:26.652
I even called a woman's
basketball team

22:26.720 --> 22:28.721
"Nappy-headed hos,"
but apparently,

22:28.789 --> 22:30.089
I'm allowed to talk like that.

22:30.156 --> 22:31.090
Why?

22:31.157 --> 22:32.492
Tracy, come on.

22:32.559 --> 22:34.293
Tracy Jordan?
Why isn't he here?

22:35.929 --> 22:37.597
I just had a meeting
with News down on four.

22:37.664 --> 22:40.065
Brian Williams sure gets close
to you when he talks.

22:40.133 --> 22:41.467
Very feminine energy.

22:41.535 --> 22:42.901
Anyway, I thought I'd just swing by

22:42.968 --> 22:45.236
and introduce myself
to Tracy Jordan, but--

22:45.304 --> 22:46.705
Ah!
He-- he is here.

22:46.773 --> 22:48.540
You know, he just likes
to learn his lines

22:48.608 --> 22:50.809
in the bathroom
and communicate by phone.

22:50.877 --> 22:52.277
Actors, am I right?

22:52.344 --> 22:54.546
You know, I once had to speak
to the Screen Actors Guild.

22:54.614 --> 22:56.047
Bunch of nutjobs.

22:56.115 --> 22:59.617
But you couldn't make movies
and TV without 'em.

23:02.186 --> 23:03.487
I'm just kidding!

23:03.555 --> 23:04.889
I mean, look at
<i>March of the Penguins.</i>

23:04.956 --> 23:05.890
Who was in that?

23:05.957 --> 23:07.324
Good luck tonight.

23:07.392 --> 23:10.494
You're gonna need it.

23:10.562 --> 23:11.862
Tracy, you can do this.

23:11.930 --> 23:13.898
You have to be at
the show tonight.

23:13.965 --> 23:15.164
Tracy who?

23:15.232 --> 23:17.233
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

23:17.301 --> 23:19.736
Look, you think the world
has turned its back on you?

23:19.804 --> 23:22.338
I know a place where
that's not true.

23:22.406 --> 23:24.741
A place where you can remember
the man you used to be.

23:24.809 --> 23:26.342
A place where you
can eat buffet ribs

23:26.410 --> 23:28.878
while someone's daughter
shakes her crack at you.

23:28.946 --> 23:31.847
Tracy Jordan, I am taking you
to a strip club.

23:35.585 --> 23:36.585
Oh, excuse me, miss.

23:36.653 --> 23:38.119
How much is a lap dance?

23:38.187 --> 23:39.387
I'm a little light on cash,

23:39.456 --> 23:40.956
but I have a PayPal account.

23:41.023 --> 23:43.358
Oh, my God.
Tracy Jordan?

23:43.426 --> 23:45.093
That's right.
Party time.

23:45.161 --> 23:47.328
When I saw you in
<i>Hard to Watch...</i>

23:47.395 --> 23:48.529
No, no, keep it light.

23:48.597 --> 23:50.097
You inspired me to contact

23:50.165 --> 23:51.799
my biological father.

23:51.867 --> 23:52.934
No daddy stuff.

23:53.001 --> 23:55.336
I hadn't spoken to him in 13 years.

23:55.403 --> 23:57.104
Maybe show him your butt.

23:57.172 --> 24:00.074
There are tears falling
on her boobies, Liz Lemon.

24:01.610 --> 24:03.376
I know you've been molested.

24:03.444 --> 24:05.144
That's how we all got here,

24:05.212 --> 24:06.613
but I don't want to hear about it.

24:06.681 --> 24:08.882
I just wanted to let you know

24:08.950 --> 24:10.183
that I'm going into the Navy.

24:10.250 --> 24:12.586
Because like you
said in your movie,

24:12.653 --> 24:14.888
"I invent my tomorrow."

24:14.956 --> 24:16.523
But I wasn't even supposed
to say that.

24:16.591 --> 24:19.692
The line was, "Shereen, I hope
Dr. Mogutu has good news

24:19.759 --> 24:20.993
"about my endoscopy,"

24:21.060 --> 24:22.361
but I couldn't get it right,

24:22.428 --> 24:23.829
so they told me to improv.

24:23.897 --> 24:25.263
Come on, guys.

24:25.331 --> 24:26.532
I'm making it rain.

24:26.600 --> 24:28.400
You see what you've done,
Liz Lemon?

24:28.468 --> 24:30.903
Tracy Jordan is broken.

24:30.971 --> 24:31.904
It's over.

24:31.972 --> 24:33.506
Get off stage!

24:33.573 --> 24:34.606
No whites!

24:35.673 --> 24:37.141
You wanted to see me,
miss Maroney?

24:37.209 --> 24:38.910
Oh, my.

24:38.978 --> 24:42.346
Candles, incense, Disco music.

24:42.414 --> 24:44.716
Someone's getting
into the easter spirit.

24:44.783 --> 24:45.817
No, Kenneth.

24:45.885 --> 24:47.552
Do you remember that silly joke

24:47.620 --> 24:49.587
about me having your baby?

24:49.655 --> 24:51.054
Yes.

24:51.122 --> 24:52.990
- So crazy.
- I know.

24:53.057 --> 24:55.592
It's crazy...

24:55.660 --> 24:58.862
Unless you're into it.

24:58.930 --> 24:59.930
What?

24:59.998 --> 25:01.865
No, ma'am.
That would be wrong.

25:01.933 --> 25:03.534
We're not married.

25:03.601 --> 25:05.702
And we're different religions.

25:05.770 --> 25:06.702
We can do whatever we want.

25:06.770 --> 25:08.037
Miss Maroney,

25:08.104 --> 25:11.340
I'd do anything for you
or mr. Jordan,

25:11.408 --> 25:12.608
but this is wrong.

25:12.676 --> 25:16.478
But, Kenneth,
you might be my only chance.

25:20.183 --> 25:22.117
No!

25:22.185 --> 25:24.953
Fine. I'll get you
when you're sleeping.

25:25.021 --> 25:28.089
It's not rape if neither party
really wants it.

25:33.095 --> 25:34.395
You're back.

25:34.463 --> 25:35.864
Yeah, and this is my front.

25:35.932 --> 25:36.865
Thanks for setting me up

25:36.933 --> 25:38.367
with another classic quote.

25:38.435 --> 25:41.001
I borrowed your whale semen candle.
It didn't work, by the way.

25:41.069 --> 25:42.102
You can keep it.

25:42.170 --> 25:43.837
I'm just packing up a few things,

25:43.905 --> 25:44.838
and then I'm gone.

25:44.906 --> 25:46.574
Wait.
Where are you going?

25:46.641 --> 25:47.875
I'm quitting show business.

25:47.943 --> 25:49.977
I can't stop the horrible respect

25:50.045 --> 25:51.979
people have for me.

25:52.047 --> 25:54.147
Tracy, you can't do that.

25:54.215 --> 25:56.616
Look, I would never say this
on the record.

25:56.684 --> 26:00.352
Of course.
This is all off the record.

26:00.420 --> 26:03.355
The show needs you,
and I need you.

26:03.423 --> 26:05.058
I'd rather do the show
than have a baby.

26:05.125 --> 26:07.594
- But you don't understand.
- Oh, I do understand.

26:07.661 --> 26:09.395
Look at Roman Polanski.

26:09.463 --> 26:10.396
No, thank you.

26:10.464 --> 26:11.964
Or Elia Kazan.

26:12.031 --> 26:14.432
He told the government
his friends were communists,

26:14.500 --> 26:16.401
then got a standing ovation
at the Oscars.

26:16.469 --> 26:17.769
That's crazy.

26:17.837 --> 26:19.071
A man named "Elia."

26:19.138 --> 26:20.706
That's a giraffe's name.

26:20.773 --> 26:22.507
You know, when you think about it,

26:22.575 --> 26:25.477
the only celebrities who
completely undo their goodwill

26:25.544 --> 26:26.711
are the murderers.

26:26.778 --> 26:29.146
John Wilkes Booth, Phil Spector,

26:29.214 --> 26:32.249
OJ Simpson,
who texted me earlier today.

26:32.317 --> 26:35.051
Shoot someone, huh?

26:35.067 --> 26:37.051
Nah. That's crazy, even for us

26:37.122 --> 26:38.990
I guess it would take
a pretty big gas leak

26:39.057 --> 26:41.458
to make you think
that was a good idea.

26:43.560 --> 26:44.794
All right!

26:44.862 --> 26:47.664
100th episode, 100 hours of comedy.

26:47.732 --> 26:48.798
Minus the commercials.

26:48.866 --> 26:53.503
20 hours of comedy.

26:53.570 --> 26:55.238
- Hey, dummy.
- Damn it.

26:55.305 --> 26:56.539
Look, Liz,

26:56.607 --> 26:58.008
if this is gonna work out
between you and me,

26:58.075 --> 27:01.276
you should know my tarantula
sleeps on my face.

27:01.344 --> 27:02.377
Oh, my God.

27:02.445 --> 27:03.612
My show is getting cancelled,

27:03.680 --> 27:05.380
I'm never speaking
to Jack Donaghy again,

27:05.448 --> 27:06.649
and the worst thing
that happened to me today

27:06.716 --> 27:07.650
is that you showed up.

27:07.717 --> 27:08.851
Ah, 'cause you called me.

27:08.918 --> 27:10.318
When I was high on gas.

27:10.386 --> 27:12.087
Do you not understand
what that means?

27:12.155 --> 27:13.188
No, not really.

27:13.256 --> 27:15.023
Gas has no effect on me at all.

27:15.090 --> 27:16.557
When I was growing up, my school,

27:16.625 --> 27:18.726
Gerry cooney elementary,
it was right next

27:18.794 --> 27:21.295
to a gas works in Queens.

27:21.363 --> 27:22.563
It ventilated into the Cafeteria.

27:22.631 --> 27:24.632
We got a big settlement
from the city.

27:24.700 --> 27:26.267
Our parents voted
to spend it on a boat

27:26.334 --> 27:28.803
that the families could share,
but then that sank.

27:28.871 --> 27:30.704
But you know what?

27:30.772 --> 27:32.639
I'm still smart enough to know

27:32.707 --> 27:35.142
that I'll never do better
than you, Liz Lemon,

27:35.209 --> 27:36.877
'cause you're a cook
in the bedroom

27:36.944 --> 27:38.011
and a whore in the kitchen.

27:38.079 --> 27:39.813
So I'm gonna give you one more shot

27:39.881 --> 27:42.049
to admit to me
that you keep bringing me back

27:42.116 --> 27:44.818
into your life for a reason.

27:44.886 --> 27:46.919
Subhas, take out the trash.

27:46.987 --> 27:48.253
Don't order me around, woman.

27:48.321 --> 27:50.522
No, I mean--
just--

27:50.590 --> 27:53.192
Dennis, get out.

27:53.259 --> 27:56.562
You'll change your mind.

28:06.806 --> 28:08.139
Let's rock, Duffy.

28:16.806 --> 28:17.939
You again!

28:18.006 --> 28:19.039
Wait a minute...

28:19.040 --> 28:22.139
- You're not Sideways Jack!
- I'm Past Jack.

28:22.211 --> 28:24.211
Because I'm from the past?
And I'm you?

28:24.279 --> 28:25.546
- Yeah, get it.
- Do you?

28:25.647 --> 28:26.914
'Cause it seems like

28:26.982 --> 28:29.584
you don't get much of anything
anymore, old man.

28:29.651 --> 28:32.219
If you're my future,
I'm gonna jump.

28:32.287 --> 28:33.220
Stop him!

28:33.288 --> 28:34.221
If he jumps,

28:34.289 --> 28:35.589
we don't exist anymore.

28:35.656 --> 28:37.156
I'm perfectly aware of that.

28:37.224 --> 28:38.558
I studied time dilation

28:38.626 --> 28:40.560
and quantum teleportation
in college.

28:40.628 --> 28:42.328
No, you didn't.
You saw <i>Time Cop.</i>

28:42.397 --> 28:43.930
Really?
I never saw <i>Time Cop.</i>

28:43.998 --> 28:46.633
You will in 2007,
and you'll love it.

28:46.701 --> 28:48.334
Why are you talking like that?

28:48.403 --> 28:51.069
This is how everyone
talked in the '80s.

28:51.137 --> 28:52.772
This is how Reagan talked.

28:52.839 --> 28:55.974
Look, there's still time
to fix this, Jack.

28:56.042 --> 28:57.810
You need to kick ass again,

28:57.878 --> 28:59.445
starting with getting rid
of that woman.

28:59.513 --> 29:00.946
Listen to him.

29:01.014 --> 29:03.015
He's awesome,
and you know he's right.

29:03.082 --> 29:04.717
Fire Lemon?

29:04.785 --> 29:05.984
I don't know if I can do that.

29:06.052 --> 29:07.786
Well, then, take this!

29:07.853 --> 29:09.888
Oh, God!

29:09.955 --> 29:11.088
That only hurt me.

29:11.156 --> 29:13.291
Why did I think that would
hurt you too?

29:13.358 --> 29:15.794
Jack, be the man
you were meant to be.

29:15.861 --> 29:16.861
Me.

29:16.929 --> 29:19.230
This tuxedo is made out
of the Puma

29:19.298 --> 29:21.332
that I rode into
my 50th birthday party.

29:21.400 --> 29:23.300
Why are you both wearing tuxedos?

29:23.367 --> 29:25.536
It's after 6:00.
What are we, farmers?

29:25.603 --> 29:27.771
Now go get rid of that woman.

29:31.175 --> 29:33.043
Just want to check everything out

29:33.110 --> 29:34.945
after your little gas scare.

29:35.012 --> 29:36.513
Well, my pen light is working.

29:36.581 --> 29:37.815
That's good.

29:37.882 --> 29:39.615
Now, can you say
the alphabet for me?

29:39.683 --> 29:41.884
Well, a very,
very heavy--

29:41.953 --> 29:44.287
uh, heavy, du--
bertation tonight.

29:44.355 --> 29:46.856
We had a very dairse--
dareson by--

29:46.924 --> 29:48.158
let's go ahead
and tersh-tayson

29:48.225 --> 29:49.225
lets gotobit anhaddapit.

29:49.293 --> 29:52.728
Excellent.

29:52.796 --> 29:54.230
My God, Jenna.

29:54.298 --> 29:56.365
Are you pregnant?
How?

29:56.433 --> 29:58.067
Did you go swimming
in a public pool?

29:58.134 --> 30:00.235
No, I got in my head
about having a baby,

30:00.303 --> 30:02.537
and now I'm having
a hysterical pregnancy.

30:02.605 --> 30:03.705
Well, that's redundant.

30:03.773 --> 30:05.107
All pregnancies are hysterical.

30:05.175 --> 30:07.376
They're started by penises.

30:07.444 --> 30:08.510
This should be perfect.

30:08.578 --> 30:10.212
I mean, all I want
is the attention.

30:10.280 --> 30:12.313
So why am I not happy?

30:12.381 --> 30:14.882
I mean, on some level,
do I want to have a baby?

30:14.950 --> 30:16.584
Do I want to be a mother?

30:16.651 --> 30:17.986
Should I be a mother?

30:18.053 --> 30:20.321
Bored!

30:20.389 --> 30:21.422
Hey.

30:21.490 --> 30:22.756
Greta Johannsen,
your animal wrangler.

30:22.824 --> 30:26.060
My God, you're beautiful.

30:26.128 --> 30:29.196
♪ if you say
good-bye tonight ♪

30:29.263 --> 30:34.001
♪ all I'll have will
be my memories ♪

30:34.068 --> 30:37.037

for the light ♪

30:37.105 --> 30:42.942
♪ I now believe these
are my memories ♪

30:43.010 --> 30:45.677
♪ my memories ♪

30:47.481 --> 30:51.317
Mr. Jordan, I refuse
to accept this is happening.

30:51.385 --> 30:54.053
You leaving is
as crazy to me as evolution,

30:54.121 --> 30:56.055
or a woman's right
to choose her haircut.

30:56.123 --> 30:58.424
I'm sorry, Ken,
but maybe Jenna was right.

30:58.492 --> 30:59.557
The only way I could come back

30:59.625 --> 31:00.725
is if I shoot someone,

31:00.792 --> 31:01.859
and that's crazy.

31:01.927 --> 31:03.528
Or is it?

31:03.595 --> 31:05.030
Maybe it's a good idea.

31:05.097 --> 31:06.431
I don't know.

31:06.499 --> 31:08.933
It has a nice, simple logic to it.

31:09.001 --> 31:10.868
Why don't we take a deep breath

31:10.936 --> 31:13.238
and then both say
what we think we should do.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.173
- You should shoot me...
- I should shoot you...

31:16.241 --> 31:17.374
- on the roof of 30 Rock!
- on the roof of 30 Rock!

31:18.876 --> 31:21.078
I only ask one thing, sir.

31:21.146 --> 31:22.579
Make it quick.

31:22.647 --> 31:24.915
I cannot promise you that, Ken.

31:24.982 --> 31:26.517
I'm a horrible shot.

31:26.584 --> 31:27.851
To the roof.

31:34.724 --> 31:36.926
- Hey, dummy.
- Hey.

31:36.993 --> 31:38.094
You ready to sign that lease?

31:38.162 --> 31:39.728
You know how we were talking earlier

31:39.796 --> 31:41.330
about me moving in with you
and how hard it is

31:41.398 --> 31:42.798
to kick a tenant out in New York?

31:42.866 --> 31:43.866
Just think about it.

31:43.934 --> 31:46.135
I'll make you chili every night.

31:46.203 --> 31:47.270
I'll provide for you.

31:47.337 --> 31:48.604
I have a new business idea.

31:48.672 --> 31:50.472
It's like Netflix,
but you go to a store,

31:50.540 --> 31:52.608
and you pick out your video
from a limited selection.

31:52.676 --> 31:54.509
- It'd be like five years ago.
- Exactly.

31:54.578 --> 31:56.478
I can move my stuff
in tonight, right?

31:56.546 --> 31:58.614
I just have one duffel bag
in a sidecar.

31:58.682 --> 31:59.648
My motorcycle got impounded

31:59.716 --> 32:01.316
from being parked too awesome.

32:01.384 --> 32:02.618
I just need you to sign
this lease I printed up

32:02.686 --> 32:03.818
off the Internet.

32:03.886 --> 32:05.920
Okay, I need a pen.

32:05.988 --> 32:07.055
You don't have a pen?

32:07.122 --> 32:08.289
You're a writer, Liz.

32:08.356 --> 32:10.024
All I have is
this kick-ass laser pointer

32:10.092 --> 32:11.826
that I point at nerds'
crotches in the park.

32:11.894 --> 32:13.394
Oh, wait.

32:13.462 --> 32:18.066
All <i>we</i> have is
this kick-ass laser pointer.

32:18.133 --> 32:20.166
Come on, baby.
Let's go find a pen.

32:20.234 --> 32:25.371
Okay.

32:28.542 --> 32:29.576
Oh, no.

32:29.644 --> 32:31.078
Let me introduce myself.

32:31.145 --> 32:33.080
I am--

32:33.147 --> 32:34.715
Future Jack, obviously.

32:34.782 --> 32:36.315
Is that what we're wearing
in ten years?

32:36.382 --> 32:38.017
More like 35 years.

32:38.085 --> 32:40.686
You're 87 years old?

32:40.754 --> 32:42.421
My God, I'm outstanding.

32:42.489 --> 32:44.123
I like to think so.

32:44.190 --> 32:46.692
I've come all the way
from the future--

32:46.760 --> 32:49.161
which is a lot harder
than coming from the past--

32:49.229 --> 32:50.496
Whatever, pops.

32:50.563 --> 32:52.764
To warn you not to listen
to the other Jacks.

32:52.832 --> 32:55.667
In the future, you're happier
than you ever imagined.

32:55.735 --> 32:59.904
You have grandchildren and a
gorgeous Polyblasian wife.

32:59.972 --> 33:03.407
That's a new race
that emerges in 2030.

33:03.475 --> 33:04.709
They're incredible.

33:04.777 --> 33:06.978
- What happened to Avery?
- Oh, you'll see.

33:07.046 --> 33:08.646
It's hilarious.

33:08.713 --> 33:11.849
Yeah, but what about his,
your, our career?

33:11.916 --> 33:13.684
Don't we wanna be this dude?

33:13.752 --> 33:17.821
Younger me's, business
is only a part of life.

33:17.889 --> 33:20.057
- Real happiness...
- Ah, shut up.

33:20.125 --> 33:21.825
Don't listen to his crap, Jack.

33:21.893 --> 33:25.094
If you choose my path,
you'll be plenty happy.

33:25.162 --> 33:26.295
You'll spearhead GE's development

33:26.363 --> 33:27.864
of the electric vagina.

33:27.931 --> 33:29.666
You won't be married,
but you'll have a house

33:29.733 --> 33:31.433
with a lot of glass, and it's cold.

33:31.501 --> 33:33.536
And you'll own the Buffalo Bills.

33:33.603 --> 33:35.638
You didn't say it was the Bills.

33:35.706 --> 33:36.873
Look, right now,

33:36.940 --> 33:39.241
Liz Lemon is downstairs
about to sign a lease

33:39.309 --> 33:40.408
with Dennis Duffy.

33:40.476 --> 33:42.177
If she does that, you'll lose her.

33:42.244 --> 33:43.879
In three years, they'll be married

33:43.946 --> 33:46.314
and living in Jacksonville, Florida,

33:46.382 --> 33:49.184
where he operates
an unlicensed alligator park.

33:49.251 --> 33:50.351
Jacksonville?

33:50.419 --> 33:52.320
Her hair can't handle that humidity.

33:52.388 --> 33:54.756
No, I don't care.
I'm tired of saving her.

33:54.824 --> 33:57.191
To quote Liz Lemon,
"Opposite!"

33:57.258 --> 33:59.160
You'd be saving yourself.

33:59.227 --> 34:01.328
The only way to get my life

34:01.396 --> 34:04.264
is to be distracted
from your blind ambition,

34:04.332 --> 34:06.000
and you can't do that

34:06.068 --> 34:08.268
without Liz Lemon in your life.

34:08.335 --> 34:10.204
Jack, this guy
is just trying to justify

34:10.271 --> 34:11.471
his own bad choices.

34:11.539 --> 34:13.106
Go down there and fire Liz.

34:20.681 --> 34:21.715
Okay.

34:21.782 --> 34:22.949
We're obviously all thinking it,

34:23.016 --> 34:24.184
so I'm just gonna say it.

34:24.251 --> 34:26.351
We're gonna have sex
with each other, right?

34:26.420 --> 34:28.954
- Yeah, we are.
- Oh, my!

34:29.022 --> 34:31.456
Lemon, don't sign that lease!

34:31.524 --> 34:33.558
- Why are you here?
- Just sign it, dummy.

34:33.626 --> 34:34.626
It's a receipt for some lez pants

34:34.694 --> 34:38.163
- you bought or whatever.
- No.

34:38.231 --> 34:40.599
If you have a problem,
I will fight you, Dennis.

34:40.666 --> 34:42.034
That wouldn't be very fair.

34:42.101 --> 34:43.601
I'm only trained to fight
four or more men at a time.

34:43.668 --> 34:44.902
There are three more of me upstairs,

34:44.969 --> 34:46.070
and I'd be happy to go get them.

34:46.138 --> 34:47.237
I can't.
I hurt my wrist.

34:47.304 --> 34:48.304
Hey, people.

34:48.373 --> 34:50.440
Somebody sabotaged the gas line.

34:50.507 --> 34:52.676
People could've died or had fights.

34:52.745 --> 34:54.277
What?
Who would do that?

34:54.346 --> 34:57.681
Hey, grab that black guy.

34:57.750 --> 34:58.682
It was you.

34:58.751 --> 34:59.883
What are you, mad at me, Liz?

34:59.951 --> 35:01.584
Huh?
I did it for love.

35:01.652 --> 35:04.087
You're insane.

35:04.155 --> 35:05.555
Hey, hey, hey, guys.

35:05.623 --> 35:07.090
Hands off the jacket, all right?

35:07.158 --> 35:09.226
It's from <i>Amar'e Stoudemire's</i>
eveningwear collection.

35:09.293 --> 35:10.961
If I ever see you again,
I'll kill you.

35:11.028 --> 35:13.329
Please.
You'll be back.

35:13.397 --> 35:15.232
All right, the gas is clearing out.

35:15.299 --> 35:16.665
It should be okay
in time for the show.

35:16.733 --> 35:17.867
According to my device here.

35:17.934 --> 35:19.201
Good work, Jennifer.

35:19.269 --> 35:21.070
Oh, my God, the show.
I gotta load in an audience.

35:21.138 --> 35:22.972
I gotta distribute scripts.

35:23.039 --> 35:25.241
I gotta change Jenna's blood.
I need Kenneth.

35:25.308 --> 35:26.541
Forget about Kenneth.

35:26.609 --> 35:28.677
I told Hank Cooper that
Tracy Jordan would be here.

35:28.745 --> 35:30.079
Where is the star of your show?

35:30.147 --> 35:31.180
Right here.

35:31.248 --> 35:32.446
I know you're talking about Tracy,

35:32.514 --> 35:33.514
but I don't care.

35:33.582 --> 35:36.151
Tracy and Kenneth went to the roof

35:36.218 --> 35:37.252
with a gun.

35:37.319 --> 35:38.253
Why?

35:38.320 --> 35:39.287
Because I gave Tracy the idea

35:39.354 --> 35:40.755
to kill the only man

35:40.823 --> 35:42.123
who would ever have a baby with me.

35:52.017 --> 35:54.151
- Nothing to see here, Mr. man.
- No, sir.

35:54.252 --> 35:55.987
Hello, Kabletown family members.

35:56.054 --> 35:59.457
And my favorite actress, Jenna.

35:59.525 --> 36:01.158
When <i>TGS</i> gets cancelled, I mean if,

36:01.226 --> 36:02.694
when <i>TGS</i> gets cancelled,

36:02.761 --> 36:04.496
we need to talk about your future.

36:04.563 --> 36:06.663
I know what my future holds, Hank.

36:06.731 --> 36:07.664
Motherhood.

36:07.732 --> 36:08.999
It's a surprise to me,

36:09.066 --> 36:10.767
but I have so much love to give.

36:10.835 --> 36:11.935
Well, why couldn't you be a mother

36:12.003 --> 36:13.704
and do a daytime talk show?

36:13.771 --> 36:15.405
Well, because the talk show
will be my baby.

36:15.473 --> 36:16.974
I'm not gonna be held back
by some uterus turd.

36:17.041 --> 36:19.275
Let's call my agent.

36:19.343 --> 36:22.345
Oh, my God.
Your stomach.

36:26.717 --> 36:28.417
For some reason,

36:28.485 --> 36:30.285
I'm starting to rethink this, sir.

36:30.353 --> 36:32.221
We all have doubt,
k-tel records.

36:32.288 --> 36:33.990
But we made a decision.

36:34.057 --> 36:35.791
And we'll look stupid
if we don't follow through.

36:35.859 --> 36:36.993
Okay.

36:37.060 --> 36:40.395
Just please tell my mother--

36:40.462 --> 36:42.463
My bad.
That was an accident.

36:42.532 --> 36:44.900
Tracy, stop!

36:44.967 --> 36:47.135
Don't startle me
when I'm holding a gun.

36:47.202 --> 36:48.737
Use your head, Liz Lemon.

36:48.804 --> 36:52.273
For God's sakes, Tracy,
give me that gun!

36:52.341 --> 36:53.708
Ugh!

36:53.776 --> 36:55.075
Do you have any idea
how much paperwork

36:55.143 --> 36:56.844
I would have to do
if you shot Kenneth?

36:56.912 --> 36:59.246
I didn't know that, Jack.
I'm sorry.

36:59.313 --> 37:03.517
I'm just trying to get people
to stop respecting me.

37:03.585 --> 37:06.420
Tracy, you want to destroy
the goodwill you have

37:06.487 --> 37:08.822
so you can go back
to your easy TV job?

37:08.890 --> 37:11.157
Yes, even more than
I want to shoot Kenneth.

37:11.224 --> 37:12.725
Then all you have to do is go back

37:12.793 --> 37:14.193
to your easy TV job.

37:14.261 --> 37:16.596
- What?
- Do TV.

37:16.664 --> 37:20.099
And no one will ever
take you seriously again.

37:20.167 --> 37:22.635
Doesn't matter how big
a movie star you are,

37:22.703 --> 37:24.003
even if you have the kind of career

37:24.071 --> 37:27.039
where you walked away
from a blockbuster franchise

37:27.106 --> 37:31.209
or worked with Meryl Streep
or Anthony Hopkins,

37:31.277 --> 37:33.912
made important movies
about things like civil rights

37:33.980 --> 37:35.881
or Pearl Harbor,

37:35.949 --> 37:37.883
stole films with supporting roles

37:37.951 --> 37:40.351
and then turned around and
blew them away on Broadway.

37:40.419 --> 37:43.454
None of that will matter
once you do television.

37:43.521 --> 37:45.556
You could win every award in sight

37:45.624 --> 37:48.459
and be the biggest thing
on the small screen,

37:48.526 --> 37:49.760
and you'll still get laughed

37:49.828 --> 37:53.064
out of the <i>Vanity Fair</i> Oscar party.

37:53.131 --> 37:55.600
by Greg Kinnear.

37:55.667 --> 37:57.969
Tracy, your career hit rock bottom

37:58.036 --> 38:00.470
the first time
you decided to do <i>TGS.</i>

38:00.537 --> 38:04.240
You want it to hit
rock bottom again?

38:04.308 --> 38:05.642
Go on Network television.

38:05.710 --> 38:08.478

38:08.545 --> 38:11.214
- Yeah.
- We have five minutes!

38:13.283 --> 38:15.117
Whoa, whoa, uh-uh.
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

38:15.184 --> 38:16.451
I'm sorry, folks.
While we were working

38:16.519 --> 38:18.220
on the gas line,
we somehow broke the elevator.

38:18.287 --> 38:19.387
She's an old building.

38:19.455 --> 38:23.025

38:25.762 --> 38:28.631

38:35.571 --> 38:37.105
Darn it.

38:37.173 --> 38:39.073
Excuse me.
The elevators are out.

38:39.142 --> 38:41.743

38:44.347 --> 38:46.681
