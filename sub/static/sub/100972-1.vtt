00:56.273 --> 00:57.407
Next, please.

01:02.947 --> 01:05.182
- How you doing?
- Good, thanks. How are you?

01:09.186 --> 01:10.720
Where are you travelling
this morning?

01:10.722 --> 01:12.522
Just going back to town.

01:15.325 --> 01:16.426
Purpose of your visit?

01:17.327 --> 01:18.563
I'm going home.

01:29.674 --> 01:31.408
- Have a nice day.
- Thanks, you too.

02:45.850 --> 02:46.851
Hello?

02:48.920 --> 02:49.921
At the house.

02:52.422 --> 02:53.457
Mmm-hmm.

03:01.632 --> 03:02.667
Okay, Dad.

03:44.942 --> 03:46.443
Yes!

03:48.880 --> 03:49.914
Very nice.

03:52.349 --> 03:53.816
What, no uniform today?

03:53.818 --> 03:55.418
Not today.
Good to see you, man.

03:56.087 --> 03:57.887
Good to see ya.

03:57.889 --> 04:00.723
It's a shame 'cause I was looking
forward to seeing the new you.

04:00.725 --> 04:01.991
Well, you should
stop by sometime.

04:01.993 --> 04:04.629
- See me in action.
- Yeah, I tried. You never returned my call.

04:09.934 --> 04:12.067
What? They don't
give you any breaks or what?

04:12.069 --> 04:14.804
Hey, man. The boxes
don't pack themselves.

04:14.806 --> 04:17.404
- Could see anyone on the way in?
- No, no. It's dead.

04:17.406 --> 04:18.808
I couldn't believe it
when the phone rang.

04:18.810 --> 04:20.108
I said, "Boy, you must
be desperate..."

04:20.111 --> 04:22.111
I guess I just missed you.

04:22.113 --> 04:24.814
- Shit!
- Come on, come on...

04:24.816 --> 04:26.751
You just needed the money,
didn't you?

04:31.556 --> 04:32.557
It's good to see you.

04:32.990 --> 04:33.991
You too.

04:45.069 --> 04:46.070
Okay.

04:49.807 --> 04:51.472
Here. I'll ride back with you.

04:51.474 --> 04:53.343
- All right.
- Throw those in my car.

05:23.473 --> 05:24.974
Oh... Got it.

05:24.976 --> 05:26.909
That was Dad.

05:26.911 --> 05:28.543
- What?
- Yeah, apparently, he left

05:28.545 --> 05:31.013
a few things at the house
and he wants me to go and...

05:31.015 --> 05:32.982
pick them up.
He didn't sound good.

05:32.984 --> 05:35.985
- Yeah, well...
- He sounds... shaken.

05:35.987 --> 05:39.755
- Uh-huh. He's adjusting.
- He's miserable, Stephen.

05:39.757 --> 05:42.457
Well, it's only been a week.

05:42.459 --> 05:44.894
He just finds things
to complain about.

05:44.896 --> 05:46.962
It's the best home in the city.
I don't know what to tell you.

05:46.964 --> 05:48.230
This makes me feel like shit.

05:48.232 --> 05:50.400
I know and that's what
he wants you to feel.

05:51.501 --> 05:52.570
You know?

05:57.975 --> 05:59.542
His house isn't safe now.

05:59.944 --> 06:01.112
I know.

06:02.580 --> 06:03.981
What if we gave him
Chris's room?

06:04.815 --> 06:05.981
- You can't be serious.
- No, come on.

06:05.983 --> 06:09.051
It's got its own little
bathroom, it's tucked away...

06:09.053 --> 06:10.352
It's not even being used.

06:10.354 --> 06:12.922
- Stephen, it's not even being used.
- I wonder why it's not?

06:12.924 --> 06:15.224
I'm gonna... We'll talk
about this later.

06:15.226 --> 06:17.826
- Stephen...
- I'm gonna... grab a few things.

06:17.828 --> 06:18.863
Shouldn't be long.

06:26.536 --> 06:28.604
You had a fucking laugh.

06:28.606 --> 06:30.906
What? You know what
I'd like to know?

06:30.908 --> 06:31.907
- What?
- What would this be for you?

06:31.909 --> 06:34.643
Like would this be, like,
nine months' salary?

06:34.645 --> 06:36.781
Oh, fuck off, man.
Fuck off.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.050
Tell me it's not more than 10.

06:42.053 --> 06:44.755
- Why do you do it? Honestly?
- You know why.

06:45.623 --> 06:47.222
Wow.

06:47.224 --> 06:49.625
How's it going with you?
How's Lori?

06:49.627 --> 06:51.060
Oh, you know...

06:51.062 --> 06:52.897
Complaining her fucking
life away.

06:53.431 --> 06:54.799
So it's the same then?

06:56.000 --> 06:57.800
Pretty much.

06:57.802 --> 06:59.070
Whoa, what's that?
What's that?

07:04.208 --> 07:06.141
- I thought you said it was dead.
- It was!

07:06.143 --> 07:08.179
- Go around!
- I can't! There's nowhere to fucking go!

07:13.918 --> 07:15.150
I'll grab the bike.
You grab the guy.

07:15.152 --> 07:16.253
No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!

07:20.925 --> 07:23.127
What's going on?

07:25.596 --> 07:27.096
Hey, what're you doing?

07:27.098 --> 07:28.664
- Hey, buddy, you okay?
- Don't talk to him.

07:28.666 --> 07:30.132
- I said don't talk to him!
- On the ground!

07:30.134 --> 07:32.067
You, on the ground!
On the fucking ground!

07:32.069 --> 07:33.736
Now! Right now!

07:33.738 --> 07:34.903
- Get the fuck down!
- Okay, okay!

07:34.905 --> 07:37.106
- You, over here! Bring the keys!
- Everything's cool.

07:37.108 --> 07:39.108
Keys! Shut the fuck up!

07:39.110 --> 07:41.076
Keys. On the ground. You too.

07:41.078 --> 07:43.012
Back up. Stay down!

07:51.088 --> 07:54.323
Okay. Okay, let's go!
Let's go!

07:54.325 --> 07:57.094
- Babe, let's go. Come on!
- Let's go then.

07:59.663 --> 08:00.662
How did he know we were here?

08:00.664 --> 08:02.064
Who gives a fuck?
I don't know. Come on, man!

08:02.066 --> 08:04.933
- What are you doing, Adams?
- Let's get the fuck out of here!

08:04.935 --> 08:06.902
- How did you know we were here?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:06.904 --> 08:08.637
- How did you know?
- Wait a second.

08:08.639 --> 08:11.040
- Get the fuck off, man.
- No, no! Wait, wait!

08:11.042 --> 08:12.276
Chris! Chris!

08:16.080 --> 08:17.980
Hey, hey, hey.
Okay, just...

08:17.982 --> 08:19.915
- Just wait a second, all right?
- Just wait, man.

08:19.917 --> 08:20.918
This was you?

08:22.386 --> 08:23.919
This's bullshit, man.

08:23.921 --> 08:26.290
That's fucking bullshit.
Just listen, okay?

08:31.962 --> 08:32.996
Both of you?

08:36.400 --> 08:38.167
It's not what you think.

08:38.169 --> 08:40.335
- This isn't...
- Jesus Christ, man!

08:40.337 --> 08:42.071
Okay.

08:42.073 --> 08:44.173
What were you gonna do?
Split it?

08:44.174 --> 08:45.774
- Was that the plan?
- Jesus, man...

08:45.776 --> 08:48.811
For 200 fucking grand?
Are you serious?

08:48.813 --> 08:50.312
Throw it away.

08:50.314 --> 08:53.082
- Oh, fuck. What... you're gonna shoot me now?
- Throw it the fuck away!

08:53.084 --> 08:55.050
- You're gonna shoot me and rob me?
- Fuck you!

08:55.052 --> 08:56.985
Fuck you!
You're such a piece of shit!

08:56.987 --> 08:58.120
Let's just talk
about this, okay?

08:58.122 --> 08:59.154
Lori, put the gun down.
What the fuck are you doing?

08:59.156 --> 09:00.489
You really think he's just
going to forgive us?

09:00.491 --> 09:03.826
- Jesus Christ! Just put the gun down.
- Listen. I'm sorry. Okay?

09:03.828 --> 09:05.761
- Just put the gun down!
- What are you sorry for?

09:05.763 --> 09:07.396
I'm sorry for...
I'm sorry for everything!

09:07.398 --> 09:09.398
I'm sorry for being
a fucking asshole!

09:09.400 --> 09:11.200
Oh, for being an asshole...

09:11.202 --> 09:12.801
Babe, look. You don't
wanna do this.

09:12.803 --> 09:15.370
You don't wanna do this.
This is not you.

09:15.372 --> 09:17.206
Oh, fuck!

09:17.208 --> 09:20.075
What the fuck? Go, go, go!

09:20.077 --> 09:22.211
Get the fucking bags!
Get the fucking bags!

09:25.883 --> 09:28.217
Fuck! You fucking bitch!

09:28.219 --> 09:30.321
Lori, get the fucking bags!

09:45.002 --> 09:47.771
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

09:49.106 --> 09:50.141
Fuck!

09:51.742 --> 09:52.943
- Chris.
- He could have killed us.

09:53.911 --> 09:56.278
He just shot me.

09:56.280 --> 09:59.016
- He just shot me.
- Just hang on! Just hang on!

11:13.390 --> 11:14.489
Hi.

11:14.491 --> 11:16.360
<i>I hate it when you
walk away like that.</i>

11:18.229 --> 11:19.964
<i>Chris is just fine.</i>

11:21.332 --> 11:25.133
- I know.
- <i>He doesn't even want to live with us.</i>

11:25.135 --> 11:27.402
<i>He knows we love him
and he has his own place...</i>

11:34.178 --> 11:35.179
What was that?

11:37.881 --> 11:39.216
I'm gonna call you back.

12:21.392 --> 12:22.426
Jeremy?

12:25.996 --> 12:28.864
- Have you been talking to your brother lately?
- Mom...

12:28.866 --> 12:31.066
He knows that you love him.

12:31.068 --> 12:33.201
Honestly. He's probably
just really busy.

12:33.203 --> 12:35.137
Well, how's his job going?

12:35.139 --> 12:37.205
- It's good.
- So, and?

12:37.207 --> 12:39.441
What do you mean,
"and?" He goes to work and he comes home.

12:39.443 --> 12:41.543
- What else do you need to know?
- I want you to talk to me.

12:41.545 --> 12:44.413
- About what, Mom?
- Everything. This...

12:44.415 --> 12:46.417
whole situation. We never
talk about it.

12:47.384 --> 12:48.553
Come on. What do you think?

12:51.121 --> 12:54.056
Well, I think if you treat
somebody like an outsider,

12:54.058 --> 12:56.925
then they become an outsider.

12:56.927 --> 12:58.894
And if you don't,
then they don't.

12:58.896 --> 13:00.130
I mean, I don't know.

13:02.567 --> 13:04.634
Mom.

13:04.636 --> 13:08.070
You see, this is... I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it that way.

13:08.072 --> 13:09.273
No, it's okay. It's fine.
It's just...

13:10.407 --> 13:12.274
It's just menopause.

13:12.276 --> 13:14.912
- Don't get it on me.
- No, you can't catch it.

13:17.582 --> 13:19.414
When did you become
so wise, huh?

13:19.416 --> 13:20.984
- Come here. What's your rush?
- Mom...

13:55.986 --> 13:58.322
Oh, fuck.

14:01.291 --> 14:02.292
What are you doing?

14:04.428 --> 14:06.061
- Nothing.
- I just saw you.

14:06.063 --> 14:08.731
- Whose bike is that?
- No one... Just a friend's.

14:08.733 --> 14:09.898
- A friend?
- Yeah.

14:09.900 --> 14:12.501
- What are you doing here?
- I was gonna borrow Pop's car.

14:12.503 --> 14:14.302
- You're gonna borrow the car?
- Yeah.

14:14.304 --> 14:16.238
- What is that blood on you?
- Huh?

14:16.240 --> 14:17.740
- What's wrong?
- I was just...

14:17.742 --> 14:19.508
- I'm gonna explain later.
- Are you okay?

14:19.510 --> 14:21.176
- I'm gonna see you later...
- Hey! Wait!

14:21.178 --> 14:22.645
Wait, wait, wait...

14:22.647 --> 14:24.580
Chris...

14:24.582 --> 14:27.617
- Oh fuck.
- Chris. Chris, tell me.

14:27.619 --> 14:30.053
Tell me. Answer me.
What happened?

14:31.088 --> 14:32.655
- Are you okay?
- It's bad.

14:32.657 --> 14:35.758
It's bad. It's really bad.
Yeah, you don't understand.

14:35.760 --> 14:38.529
- I'll understand. Just tell me.
- There was a...

14:40.063 --> 14:41.697
There was a girl.
She was on my bike.

14:41.699 --> 14:42.832
- Right.
- And she fell off

14:42.834 --> 14:45.703
and I tried to turn back
to get her, but I couldn't.

14:46.370 --> 14:48.704
- You left her?
- I had to.

14:48.706 --> 14:51.108
I couldn't carry her
or the bags.

14:53.778 --> 14:55.245
Why didn't you call
an ambulance?

14:57.649 --> 14:59.114
- Just...
- What?

14:59.116 --> 15:00.652
- Just...
- What?

15:03.287 --> 15:04.656
She was shot, Dad.

15:09.159 --> 15:10.461
They would've asked questions.

15:12.463 --> 15:13.796
So I hid her...

15:13.798 --> 15:17.432
I hid her away in one
of the old fields behind...

15:17.434 --> 15:19.203
by the Myers Farm, so...

15:23.307 --> 15:24.374
There was no one around.

15:27.377 --> 15:29.612
I gotta go back there
before someone finds her.

15:29.614 --> 15:31.048
Is she still alive?

15:34.318 --> 15:35.385
I don't think so.

15:37.120 --> 15:39.657
- Okay. You know what're you gonna do?
- I don't know.

15:40.224 --> 15:42.157
Do you even have a plan?

15:42.159 --> 15:43.293
It's a human being.

15:44.194 --> 15:45.661
Chris.

15:45.663 --> 15:47.197
- It's a human being.
- I know that.

15:49.634 --> 15:50.668
I didn't have a choice.

15:54.639 --> 15:56.039
- Get in the car.
- What?

15:56.774 --> 15:58.075
What're we gonna do?

15:59.677 --> 16:00.678
Hey!

17:26.430 --> 17:28.766
Did you get my message?

17:30.367 --> 17:32.135
Yeah, just bleeding
to death over here.

17:33.705 --> 17:35.671
Yeah.

17:35.673 --> 17:37.541
I don't know.
'Cause he's a greedy cunt.

17:38.241 --> 17:41.443
Yeah. Yeah.

17:41.445 --> 17:43.581
Look, uh... I'm gonna need
your help finding him.

17:44.916 --> 17:47.317
I don't know! That's why
I'm fucking calling you!

17:48.720 --> 17:50.320
What do you usually charge?
Like, 10?

17:51.689 --> 17:53.290
No, I'm at his place now.

17:54.626 --> 17:56.259
Yeah. No, I don't know.

17:57.294 --> 17:58.628
All right. All right!

17:58.630 --> 18:00.330
Just fucking...
Just let me know.

18:00.698 --> 18:01.766
Okay.

18:05.837 --> 18:07.237
Where do you want these?

18:09.574 --> 18:10.575
Mom?

18:12.376 --> 18:14.209
Mom, where do you want these?

18:14.211 --> 18:16.544
- Why are you yelling?
- Where do you want them?

18:16.546 --> 18:17.815
I want them in the shed.

18:32.496 --> 18:33.562
Hey.

18:33.564 --> 18:35.665
- Where's Chris?
- What?

18:35.667 --> 18:36.932
Where's Chris?
Where the fuck is Chris?

18:36.934 --> 18:39.935
I don't know.
He doesn't live here anymore.

18:39.937 --> 18:42.905
Look. Where would he go to hide?

18:42.907 --> 18:45.409
- If he didn't wanna be found, where the fuck would he go?
- His apartment.

18:47.578 --> 18:48.744
- Try harder.
- I don't know.

18:50.447 --> 18:51.814
- I don't know.
- Want me to ask Mom and Dad?

18:51.816 --> 18:52.950
Okay. Okay, stop!

18:56.253 --> 18:57.987
Fuck! Okay. I know a spot.

18:57.989 --> 19:00.022
I don't know if he's gonna
be there, but we can try.

19:00.024 --> 19:01.659
Good. Okay. Show me.

19:02.927 --> 19:03.928
You show me.

19:25.783 --> 19:27.550
And why
would he rob you?

19:27.552 --> 19:29.752
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do.

19:29.754 --> 19:31.687
- He must've been jealous.
- Jealous of what?

19:31.689 --> 19:33.723
I thought you just said
that he was your friend.

19:33.725 --> 19:34.826
We were.

19:36.027 --> 19:38.027
It's complicated.

19:38.029 --> 19:39.929
You just bring it across
and you hand it over.

19:39.931 --> 19:41.833
Is that... Is that what happens?

19:43.400 --> 19:45.400
It's the exact same thing...

19:45.402 --> 19:47.937
that you got caught for before.
That's what we're talking about here.

19:47.939 --> 19:50.740
The thing that's almost
torn this family apart.

19:50.742 --> 19:52.542
- That's what we're talking about, right?
- Yeah.

20:03.988 --> 20:05.857
- There it is.
- Just keep driving. Keep driving.

20:09.694 --> 20:11.729
Okay, pull over. Pull over.

20:55.472 --> 20:57.438
- You didn't leave a marker?
- What?

20:57.440 --> 20:59.509
- You didn't leave a marker?
- No, I didn't have any time.

21:00.544 --> 21:02.044
Oh, Jesus.
It all looks the same.

21:02.046 --> 21:03.946
Yeah, I know.
I could've sworn she was...

21:03.948 --> 21:06.851
Fuck! Fucking,
fucking she was...

21:21.933 --> 21:23.067
What the hell?

21:29.974 --> 21:30.975
Shit!

21:31.508 --> 21:32.509
Fuck!

21:33.811 --> 21:35.680
- Shit.
- Wait. Where did you...

21:37.715 --> 21:39.416
Fuck. I'm okay.

21:40.651 --> 21:41.984
You don't even know
which side she's on?

21:41.986 --> 21:43.020
I do. Just...

21:46.824 --> 21:48.023
Well, maybe
somebody found her.

21:48.025 --> 21:51.492
No. If they did, there'd be
cops everywhere, Dad. Fuck.

21:51.494 --> 21:54.029
- Well maybe she is not dead.
- Do you really think I would leave her

21:54.031 --> 21:56.133
if she wasn't dead?
Just help me.

21:58.202 --> 21:59.436
Look in there.

22:05.776 --> 22:07.979
Princess!

22:09.780 --> 22:10.982
Come on, girl!

22:27.464 --> 22:28.931
Look, man.
He must've been desperate.

22:28.933 --> 22:30.400
Nah, he's just
a fucking prick.

22:30.801 --> 22:31.903
Wait.

22:32.870 --> 22:34.637
Were you talking to him?

22:34.639 --> 22:37.139
No. No, I wasn't.

22:37.141 --> 22:39.241
- I thought he was done...
- Oh, fuck you, you little shit.

22:39.243 --> 22:41.646
You think I don't know
about you? Huh?

22:44.015 --> 22:47.850
I know you used to sell
dime bags for him.

22:47.852 --> 22:50.653
I know all about you.
So don't try to cover for him.

22:50.655 --> 22:53.488
I know that your mom
had a fucking breakdown

22:53.490 --> 22:55.826
when he got caught and that
didn't even stop him, did it?

22:56.661 --> 22:58.661
Does she know
about you too, huh?

22:58.663 --> 23:00.528
Look, I'm just saying...

23:00.530 --> 23:02.031
- I know he liked you.
- Oh, fuck you!

23:02.033 --> 23:03.632
He hasn't called me
in two years.

23:03.634 --> 23:05.500
He had to make a clean break.

23:05.502 --> 23:07.102
That' what he told me.
He had to cut everything off.

23:07.104 --> 23:08.572
All right. Get out.

23:09.674 --> 23:10.708
Get the fuck out.

23:19.817 --> 23:21.118
- Hello.
- Hey.

23:22.753 --> 23:24.521
- How's it going?
- Good.

23:25.189 --> 23:26.691
Good. Yeah.

23:27.224 --> 23:28.123
I'm Chris.

23:28.125 --> 23:29.925
- Wayne.
- Hey, nice to meet you, Wayne.

23:29.927 --> 23:32.661
- Yeah.
- What's, uh... What's going on?

23:32.663 --> 23:35.664
Uh, she's got herself into
something down there.

23:35.666 --> 23:37.099
- Something dead probably.
- Yeah.

23:37.101 --> 23:38.434
- You know what they're like.
- Yeah.

23:38.436 --> 23:41.036
- They love getting the stick, don't they?
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

23:41.038 --> 23:42.271
- I love dogs.
- Yeah.

23:42.273 --> 23:45.074
Here, girl. Come here, girl.

23:45.076 --> 23:46.608
- Come here.
- Don't worry about her.

23:46.610 --> 23:48.012
She's fine. Seriously.

23:48.946 --> 23:50.879
Poor thing has Parkinson's.

23:50.881 --> 23:53.215
- Really?
- Her motor skills are shot, but

23:53.217 --> 23:55.584
I swear it's affecting
her brain.

23:55.586 --> 23:56.986
She's half mental.

24:59.350 --> 25:01.719
- Is everything okay? Where are you?
- I'm with Adams.

25:02.887 --> 25:03.921
We're at Pop's.

25:07.191 --> 25:08.690
Are you okay?

25:08.692 --> 25:10.692
<i>Look. Don't say anything.</i>

25:10.694 --> 25:12.661
- Where are you?
- I'm gonna come with the bags right now.

25:12.663 --> 25:14.163
Just don't hurt him, okay?
I'll be over there in just a bit.

25:14.165 --> 25:16.031
- Fuck you!
- I swear to God,

25:16.033 --> 25:17.768
I didn't wanna do this.
I didn't have a choice, man.

25:18.836 --> 25:21.770
- I owe money... A lot of money.
- To who?

25:21.772 --> 25:23.372
Who do you owe
money to? Tell me.

25:23.374 --> 25:24.807
It doesn't matter...

25:24.809 --> 25:26.742
Fuck you, it matters!
You shot me!

25:26.744 --> 25:28.077
<i>No, she shot you.</i>

25:28.079 --> 25:29.178
Yeah, well, you know what?

25:29.180 --> 25:31.148
I'll fucking get her back,
don't worry about that.

25:35.853 --> 25:36.887
You already did.

25:41.258 --> 25:42.293
She's dead, man.

25:42.993 --> 25:43.994
<i>What?</i>

25:46.030 --> 25:47.131
You shot her.

25:49.100 --> 25:50.833
Fuck you. You're lying to me.

25:50.835 --> 25:52.736
<i>I'm not, I'm not.
She didn't make it.</i>

26:08.686 --> 26:10.020
You used her against me.

26:12.790 --> 26:15.090
You knew how she felt
and you used her against me.

26:15.092 --> 26:17.826
- No, it wasn't like that...
- <i>Yes, it is!</i>

26:17.828 --> 26:19.862
- Listen, buddy, it wasn't...
- <i>And now she's dead! You know what?</i>

26:19.864 --> 26:22.097
You better get the fuck over
here with those bags right now,

26:22.099 --> 26:24.900
or I'll shoot your whole fucking family.
Do you understand me?

26:24.902 --> 26:26.702
<i>Don't you even think
about calling the cops,</i>

26:26.704 --> 26:28.038
<i>'cause I'm not going
to jail again.</i>

26:35.746 --> 26:37.913
We gotta go.
We... gotta go back.

26:37.915 --> 26:39.815
- Why?
- He got Jeremy.

26:39.817 --> 26:42.050
- What?
- Jeremy's with him.

26:42.052 --> 26:44.119
What are you talking about?
Look, where?

26:44.121 --> 26:46.755
I don't know, but I know a guy
who can find them

26:46.757 --> 26:48.790
and he can take care of Adams.
We can go there right now.

26:48.792 --> 26:50.959
In 30 minutes, this'll all be over.
We'll never see Adams again.

26:50.961 --> 26:52.194
We just gotta pay him.
Adams knows him

26:52.196 --> 26:53.929
and he knows not to fuck
with him, okay?

26:53.931 --> 26:56.231
- Let's go there right now!
- What are you talking about?

26:56.233 --> 26:58.033
Are you talking about calling
some sort of hitman?

26:58.035 --> 26:59.234
No, no. He's not a hitman.

26:59.236 --> 27:01.303
He's... He's protection.

27:01.305 --> 27:03.007
This is why I didn't want
you to come along.

27:05.042 --> 27:07.075
- I'm gonna call the police.
- No! No, no, no!

27:07.077 --> 27:08.477
Dad, Dad, Dad!
You can't call the police!

27:08.479 --> 27:10.047
If they police get involved,
he'll kill him.

27:12.516 --> 27:13.751
He will.

27:14.752 --> 27:15.753
He'll kill him.

27:17.288 --> 27:18.322
He just said that.

27:33.804 --> 27:34.805
He won't hurt him.

27:36.507 --> 27:38.108
I know you don't believe me,
but it's true.

27:39.476 --> 27:41.310
He just wants the bags.

27:41.312 --> 27:43.078
Which we don't have.

27:43.080 --> 27:45.080
He doesn't know that.

27:45.082 --> 27:46.784
So as long as he thinks
that we do,

27:47.418 --> 27:48.719
then we have time.

27:49.887 --> 27:52.020
And if we act now,

27:52.022 --> 27:53.855
then we can... We can...

27:53.857 --> 27:55.924
I don't know we can get
the upper hand, but

27:55.926 --> 27:57.728
if the police show up,
I don't know what he's gonna do.

27:58.929 --> 27:59.964
So it's up to you.

28:01.932 --> 28:04.900
What about this girl?
This girl in the field?

28:04.902 --> 28:06.134
We're just gonna
leave her here to die?

28:06.136 --> 28:07.369
She's already dead.

28:07.371 --> 28:09.240
And even if we find her,
he's not gonna stop.

28:11.809 --> 28:12.943
We're gonna have to face him.

28:15.546 --> 28:17.813
God!

28:17.815 --> 28:19.383
Guess I don't have
a choice, do I?

28:21.018 --> 28:24.019
Once we get Jeremy back,
we'll come back for her.

28:24.021 --> 28:25.454
I just gotta stop
by a bank machine.

28:25.456 --> 28:27.456
- What?
- I gotta pay him.

28:27.458 --> 28:28.523
We'll pay him later.

28:28.525 --> 28:29.958
No! It doesn't work like that.

28:29.960 --> 28:32.494
There's one in the strip mall.
It's on the way, I'll be five minutes.

29:04.995 --> 29:06.196
You know, I met your mom.

29:09.333 --> 29:12.403
Couple of years ago, Lori and I were
helping Chris move. She stopped on by.

29:16.974 --> 29:21.209
There was this funny moment
that I'll never forget.

29:21.211 --> 29:24.048
I caught her staring at us
from across the room. You know.

29:27.084 --> 29:28.986
I smiled to her, you know.

29:31.255 --> 29:35.123
She just kept staring at us with
this blank expression, like.

29:35.125 --> 29:38.226
"Oh, she did not approve of us."
You know.

29:39.897 --> 29:41.332
We were not good
enough for her.

29:41.766 --> 29:43.200
Or for her son.

29:46.437 --> 29:49.304
I was pretty impressed honestly,
because most people would have looked away.

29:49.306 --> 29:50.906
But...

29:50.908 --> 29:53.310
She just...
she just held it there.

29:58.315 --> 30:02.186
You know, your brother always painted a
picture of her like she was half a wreck.

30:04.521 --> 30:05.956
Didn't seem that way to me.

30:07.559 --> 30:09.860
Seemed like she had more guts
than the rest of you.

30:14.365 --> 30:18.233
You haven't changed, you haven't changed.
You haven't changed one bit.

30:18.235 --> 30:19.669
And you wonder why you
don't have any friends.

30:19.671 --> 30:23.004
'Cause you screwed them all over
and you fought half of 'em like you

30:23.006 --> 30:25.107
- your friend in soccer.
- He wasn't my friend.

30:25.109 --> 30:26.508
- He wasn't your friend?
- He wasn't my friend.

30:26.510 --> 30:30.145
Oh, well then who was your friend?
Was the kid in band your friend?

30:30.147 --> 30:33.450
Or half the kids on the goddamn street?
Were they your friends?

30:35.720 --> 30:37.254
I would have given you money.

30:39.123 --> 30:42.124
If you needed it that bad,
I would have mortgaged the house.

30:42.126 --> 30:44.259
- All you had to do is ask.
- Oh, Right!

30:44.261 --> 30:45.262
Right!

30:49.233 --> 30:50.901
You haven't talked
to me in over a year.

30:51.636 --> 30:54.369
Well, neither of you have.

30:54.371 --> 30:57.040
You treat me like
I don't even exist.

30:57.975 --> 30:59.742
And that's fine. I fucked up,

30:59.744 --> 31:02.980
I get it, but don't go on like
I can just call you up.

31:04.214 --> 31:06.651
Because that's bullshit.
Jesus Christ, Dad.

31:08.285 --> 31:09.486
You gave up on me.

31:11.155 --> 31:14.055
I had nowhere to turn, and you
closed the door on my face

31:14.057 --> 31:17.727
So, don't act like I can just
turn to you when I need help.

31:17.729 --> 31:19.163
Because I can't.

31:23.233 --> 31:25.367
And I didn't fight all
my friends.

31:25.369 --> 31:27.335
That kid in soccer,
you told me to hit him.

31:27.337 --> 31:29.641
He was picking on me,
and you told me to hit him.

31:34.011 --> 31:35.379
I know I was doing good
until today.

31:37.448 --> 31:38.449
I work hard.

31:42.219 --> 31:43.220
You have no idea.

32:29.834 --> 32:31.101
Hurry up.

32:52.724 --> 32:55.090
- Hey love.
- Hey!

32:55.092 --> 32:57.092
What's going on, I thought you'd
be back by now.

32:57.094 --> 33:00.497
Well, there's just been a little
accident with the car.

33:21.819 --> 33:22.820
How's it going?

33:24.388 --> 33:25.522
- Good.
- Good!

33:28.392 --> 33:30.127
Just looking to sell
an earring of mine.

33:30.862 --> 33:32.260
I've got a watch too.

33:32.262 --> 33:34.195
I was actually in a few
weeks ago.

33:34.197 --> 33:35.633
You offered me six grand for
the earring.

33:38.803 --> 33:39.837
Six grand, eh?

33:40.572 --> 33:41.573
Yeah.

33:44.441 --> 33:46.443
Offer my wife, too?

33:49.146 --> 33:50.746
No, it's fine. Honestly.

33:50.748 --> 33:52.915
<i>Okay, well,
let me know if you need anything.</i>

33:52.917 --> 33:55.517
I just... I'll let you know.

33:55.519 --> 33:57.722
Hey, listen, you haven't talked
to Jeremy, have you?

34:00.290 --> 34:03.458
Um, no. Why?

34:03.460 --> 34:06.528
That's weird. I asked him to put
a couple of things in the shed and

34:06.530 --> 34:08.429
I haven't seen him since.

34:08.431 --> 34:11.168
I tried calling,
but he's not picking up.

34:13.737 --> 34:17.239
He just... he said that he had
some things to do.

34:18.342 --> 34:20.208
Yeah.

34:20.210 --> 34:22.277
<i>I get it. I think
I better get going, or else...</i>

34:22.279 --> 34:23.313
Dad called again.

34:35.960 --> 34:37.560
I'll give you four grand.

34:37.562 --> 34:40.328
Come on, man.
Two weeks ago it was six.

34:40.330 --> 34:42.264
- Two weeks ago I had cash.
- Jim?

34:43.568 --> 34:46.735
Jimmy Martin.
Hazelwood elementary?

34:46.737 --> 34:48.268
No, sorry.

34:48.271 --> 34:50.405
My gosh,
you're the spitting image

34:50.407 --> 34:51.641
- of one of my students.
- Just give me a second.

34:51.643 --> 34:52.742
What?

34:52.744 --> 34:54.242
I taught there 15 years
before I hurt my shoulder.

34:54.244 --> 34:56.946
You know what, screw it man, let's do it.
Let's do four. Four is good.

34:56.947 --> 34:58.513
Are you sure you're not related
to the Martins?

34:58.515 --> 34:59.949
No, I don't know them,
I'm sorry.

34:59.951 --> 35:02.654
Excuse me, we'll do four. Four is fine.

35:03.821 --> 35:04.822
You know what?

35:06.924 --> 35:08.726
It's a nice stone, but uh...

35:10.962 --> 35:12.394
I got a lot of nice stones.

35:12.396 --> 35:13.596
Oh, come on, man.

35:13.598 --> 35:16.431
Come on, what's the problem?
Let's do it. Let's do four.

35:16.433 --> 35:17.434
Sorry, man.

35:19.503 --> 35:22.303
Yeah, I do know that. So what?
What are we gonna do?

35:22.305 --> 35:24.006
So, maybe we acted too quickly.

35:24.008 --> 35:25.440
Oh, for God's sakes.

35:25.442 --> 35:26.909
<i>It's not working.</i>

35:26.911 --> 35:28.410
I wanna talk about
Chris's room again.

35:28.412 --> 35:31.413
Yeah, they're calling me over right
now, you know. I really got to go.

35:31.415 --> 35:34.550
No, don't do that. I really,
really think that this can work.

35:34.552 --> 35:37.653
Listen, I've got people coming at me from this
side, I've got you coming at me from this side.

35:37.655 --> 35:41.289
You always do this.
Every single time.

35:41.291 --> 35:42.424
<i>I got to go now.</i>

35:42.426 --> 35:44.492
I don't wanna give up
on him, Stephen.

35:44.494 --> 35:45.563
No, just our son.

36:02.512 --> 36:03.813
- I don't understand the problem.
- I was just being polite.

36:03.815 --> 36:06.916
I came in here. I came in here
two weeks ago.

36:06.918 --> 36:10.485
With the exact same stone and
you offered me $6000

36:10.487 --> 36:12.353
and now you won't do four man?

36:12.355 --> 36:13.989
I didn't even think
you'd say yes.

36:13.991 --> 36:16.625
- You offered me six grand...
- I didn't think you'd say yes.

36:16.627 --> 36:20.395
- Then you offer me and four's no good.
- It's not a good week.

36:20.397 --> 36:21.697
- Gotcha. Come back.
- Jesus!

36:21.699 --> 36:22.834
Come back.

36:29.339 --> 36:31.073
It's not the same one.

36:31.075 --> 36:32.942
- Excuse me?
- Did you switch it?

36:32.944 --> 36:34.476
- Did you switch it?
- Hey, hey.

36:34.478 --> 36:35.978
Did you fucking switch it?

36:35.980 --> 36:38.313
Hey, hey, hey.

36:38.315 --> 36:39.949
No, no, no, I'm sorry.

36:39.951 --> 36:42.383
- Just take the stone and go.
- I don't want that piece of shit.

36:42.385 --> 36:43.853
- I'm calling the police.
- I want my diamond earring, please. Call 'em.

36:43.855 --> 36:45.487
- Tell them you're trying to fucking rob me.
- Hello?

36:45.489 --> 36:47.089
I need car down here...

36:47.091 --> 36:49.558
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Let me go.

36:49.560 --> 36:50.960
Get the fuck off me, man.

36:58.936 --> 37:01.036
I've got to go.

37:01.038 --> 37:04.341
I really got to go. I'm gonna
call you right back. Okay.

37:11.749 --> 37:14.717
- Hey, hey, hey! Chris!
- He tried to rob me.

37:14.719 --> 37:16.752
The police are coming.
They're on their way.

37:16.754 --> 37:19.054
Four thousand for my earring.

37:19.056 --> 37:21.356
- I never said that!
- Yes, you did!

37:21.358 --> 37:23.025
Chris, what the hell
are you doing?

37:23.027 --> 37:25.493
- He puts in a fake and he switches it.
- What are you doing here?

37:25.495 --> 37:26.731
Your son is a liar.

37:27.531 --> 37:29.098
Your son's a liar.

37:29.100 --> 37:33.135
Look, I know, I know if I told you about
the earring then you wouldn't come.

37:33.137 --> 37:35.505
- Earring?
- I didn't have the money.

37:37.374 --> 37:40.810
But I swear to God,
he ripped me off.

37:40.812 --> 37:43.948
As soon as he turned around,
he fucking switched it.

37:45.149 --> 37:46.949
And now he won't give
us the money.

37:46.951 --> 37:48.953
I don't have anything to pay Samson with.
He fucked us okay.

37:51.521 --> 37:52.924
Dad, dad, dad.

37:53.591 --> 37:54.725
I promise you.

37:56.627 --> 37:57.762
I fucking promise you.

37:59.664 --> 38:01.764
I know how much hurt
I've caused everyone.

38:01.766 --> 38:05.435
I know that, and there's nothing I can do
about it. But I'm telling you the truth.

38:13.778 --> 38:16.544
- Did you tell my son that you're gonna give him four grand.
- No I did not.

38:16.546 --> 38:18.047
The police are coming,
they are on the way

38:18.049 --> 38:19.849
- Bullshit.
- Is that what you do, you...

38:19.851 --> 38:22.751
You wait till people's backs are
turned and then you rob them?

38:22.753 --> 38:24.854
- Did you rob my son?
- He's a liar.

38:24.856 --> 38:26.155
- We're not leaving without that money.
- Chris.

38:26.157 --> 38:28.456
Well I guess you're not
leaving then.

38:28.458 --> 38:30.693
'Cause this is my shop, pal.

38:30.695 --> 38:33.461
And we can wait as long as
you can wait here.

38:33.463 --> 38:35.764
And you don't come in here
dictating to me and my wife.

38:35.766 --> 38:40.202
Well, I'm not trying to dictate.
I just want you to give him what's his.

38:40.204 --> 38:43.205
- Who the hell are you anyway?
- Who am I? I...

38:43.207 --> 38:45.076
- His father.
- And who you think they're gonna believe?

38:46.978 --> 38:49.011
Where did he even get the stone?
Did you ask him that?

38:49.013 --> 38:51.180
- It's not your fucking business.
- Exactly.

38:51.182 --> 38:53.017
Because he probably stole it.

38:55.953 --> 38:59.588
I mean what kind of kid walks
around with a $5000 diamond.

38:59.590 --> 39:01.759
Oh, now it's 5000?
You fucking piece of shit.

39:04.996 --> 39:06.697
You must be real proud
of this one.

39:09.532 --> 39:11.901
Good job with the parenting,
man. Congratulations.

39:16.574 --> 39:19.575
Dad! Dad! The money in the safe.

39:19.577 --> 39:20.811
Dad, the safe,
the money.

39:21.712 --> 39:22.980
- Okay!
- Do it.

39:26.549 --> 39:28.483
$4000. Okay.

39:28.485 --> 39:30.119
We're just gonna get
what's ours...

39:30.121 --> 39:31.687
- Chris?
- Yeah?

39:31.689 --> 39:33.188
- Let him go.
- I got him.

39:33.190 --> 39:35.257
Let him go. We're just gonna
take what's ours.

39:35.259 --> 39:36.959
- I got him, Dad.
- We're gonna go.

39:36.961 --> 39:38.829
We're gonna go, let's go.

39:39.597 --> 39:40.965
Keep the stone.

41:19.363 --> 41:21.232
Did I really tell you
to hit him?

41:22.900 --> 41:25.703
That kid from soccer,
the kid with the... Jesus!

41:27.271 --> 41:29.138
I don't remember that.

41:29.140 --> 41:31.940
I remember him though,
I remember that he had buck teeth

41:31.942 --> 41:34.045
and that he looked
like a little beaver.

41:38.082 --> 41:39.850
Why didn't he get
his teeth fixed?

41:41.252 --> 41:44.622
Seriously! Didn't he
have parents?

41:49.660 --> 41:51.293
I saw him not long ago.

41:51.295 --> 41:52.696
What was he doing?

41:53.898 --> 41:54.999
He was cutting wood.

42:00.638 --> 42:03.874
With... a skill saw.
He's a carpenter.

42:06.777 --> 42:07.978
Well, good for him.

42:09.146 --> 42:10.147
Good for him.

42:12.850 --> 42:14.018
Hold up, hold up.

42:22.193 --> 42:23.292
Wait a minute. Is that?

42:23.294 --> 42:25.763
It's fine, it's not like he's
gonna call the cops.

42:28.132 --> 42:30.432
I'll just give him the money and
he'll take care of it. Okay?

42:30.434 --> 42:31.902
And then we'll get Jeremy back.

42:41.946 --> 42:42.947
It's okay.

42:47.852 --> 42:50.221
- I'll be in and out.
- Yeah, that's what you said last time.

42:56.327 --> 42:58.028
Wait. Chris.

43:14.044 --> 43:15.179
Okay.

43:42.006 --> 43:43.505
- Jesus!
- Fuck!

43:43.507 --> 43:44.942
I thought you were
the neighbor.

43:46.043 --> 43:47.910
Come put a lock on the gate.

43:47.912 --> 43:49.444
Only way the mutt can get in
and out of the house.

43:49.446 --> 43:52.247
Yeah, I know. He's scared of the stairs.

43:52.249 --> 43:55.817
You know.

43:55.819 --> 43:58.253
How you been? Haven't seen
you forever.

43:58.255 --> 43:59.955
- I'm all right, man.
- Fuck.

43:59.957 --> 44:01.223
- Yeah.
- He misses you, too.

44:02.226 --> 44:04.226
How's your old man, huh?
Is he still teaching?

44:04.228 --> 44:05.894
Uh, no, he just retired.

44:05.896 --> 44:07.162
- Shit.
- Yeah.

44:07.164 --> 44:08.165
Mr. Davis.

44:08.966 --> 44:10.365
Love that guy.

44:10.367 --> 44:12.234
Always gave us smokes,
you know.

44:12.236 --> 44:14.403
Yeah. Listen, uh...

44:14.405 --> 44:16.905
I'm in a little
trouble here, man.

44:16.907 --> 44:19.877
Oh, fuck. Yeah. No, fuck,
come in, come in.

44:20.544 --> 44:22.277
All right, let's go inside.

44:22.279 --> 44:23.912
Yeah, come on.

44:23.914 --> 44:25.316
Get in there,
go down the hall, go!

44:25.950 --> 44:27.316
Fuck.

44:27.318 --> 44:29.218
So, what's going on?

44:29.220 --> 44:31.086
Listen, so you, uh...

44:31.088 --> 44:32.821
You know, Adams, right?
You remember him?

44:32.823 --> 44:34.258
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. Well, he, uh...

44:35.492 --> 44:37.560
He tried to rob me
this morning, man.

44:37.562 --> 44:39.228
- What? I thought you guys were buds.
- Yeah, down the alley.

44:39.230 --> 44:41.496
Yeah, I thought so, too, till he
fucking shot his girlfriend.

44:41.498 --> 44:43.131
He tried to shoot
my little brother.

44:43.133 --> 44:45.534
- Fuck. Fuck.
- Yeah, he just went off, man.

44:45.536 --> 44:49.004
Shot her in the stomach. And me and my
little brother we're lucky to get out alive.

44:49.006 --> 44:51.073
I don't know what to fucking do.
All right, so I'm just thinking...

44:51.075 --> 44:52.307
Thinking maybe you
could help me out?

44:52.309 --> 44:54.176
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah?

44:54.178 --> 44:55.479
Come on, come here, man.
Come on.

44:57.448 --> 44:58.482
You met Deb, right?

44:59.516 --> 45:01.183
Uh, we met
a bunch of times, yeah.

45:01.185 --> 45:02.417
That's our little girl, Madison.

45:02.419 --> 45:03.885
Huh? Jesus Christ!

45:03.887 --> 45:05.020
Oh, no, don't worry about that.

45:05.022 --> 45:06.421
Have a seat, man.
We'll hammer it out.

45:06.423 --> 45:07.489
Just give me a sec.

45:07.491 --> 45:10.461
Hey, you ever
meet Maddie, Chris?

45:10.729 --> 45:12.027
Uh...

45:12.029 --> 45:13.328
I didn't, no.

45:13.330 --> 45:14.997
She's our little miracle.

45:14.999 --> 45:15.931
- Yeah.
- Aren't ya?

45:15.933 --> 45:17.868
Just a little miracle

45:19.870 --> 45:21.305
She looks good on you.

45:28.279 --> 45:29.880
Okay.

45:32.449 --> 45:33.949
Yep.

45:45.396 --> 45:46.261
<i>Hey, man.</i>

45:46.263 --> 45:48.365
- You got the money?
- <i>Yes, what's up?</i>

45:49.300 --> 45:52.000
Yeah. Well, he's here.

45:52.002 --> 45:54.136
<i>What? What do you mean?</i>

45:54.138 --> 45:55.971
I mean, he's in my living room.

45:55.973 --> 45:57.141
He just showed up.

46:00.944 --> 46:03.078
Yeah. Probably, yeah.

46:03.080 --> 46:04.614
<i>You remember, I hired
you first okay.</i>

46:04.616 --> 46:06.114
But it's gotta cost you 20 now.

46:07.451 --> 46:09.552
You fucking told me 10!

46:09.554 --> 46:11.887
Well, he said
that it's your fault.

46:11.889 --> 46:13.288
So, how do I know?
Maybe you're lying.

46:13.290 --> 46:15.558
They fucking
shot me, man!

46:15.560 --> 46:16.925
What do you expect?

46:16.927 --> 46:19.127
You tried to shoot
his little brother!

46:19.129 --> 46:20.529
What?

46:20.531 --> 46:21.997
No, I never... When?

46:21.999 --> 46:24.199
<i>I don't know,
this morning?</i>

46:24.201 --> 46:26.268
The fucking brother wasn't there
this morning.

46:26.270 --> 46:27.304
<i>That's not what he said.</i>

46:28.372 --> 46:31.641
<i>He said that after
you shot your girl in the back,</i>

46:31.643 --> 46:33.442
<i>you tried to shoot him
and his little brother.</i>

46:33.444 --> 46:35.177
<i>So, I don't know.</i>

46:35.179 --> 46:37.312
<i>I mean,
it's your word against his.</i>

46:37.314 --> 46:38.480
<i>And this is
an old friend of mine,</i>

46:38.482 --> 46:40.650
<i>not some asshole
off the street.</i>

46:40.652 --> 46:42.050
So...

46:42.052 --> 46:44.221
I'm... I'm half conflicted here.

46:45.255 --> 46:46.955
Okay, okay, okay.

46:46.957 --> 46:48.591
Fine, fuck, it's 20, fine.

46:48.593 --> 46:50.628
Just make sure he doesn't
fucking leave, you hear me?

46:51.328 --> 46:52.695
I'm on my way.

46:52.697 --> 46:53.663
And I'm not far.

46:53.665 --> 46:55.366
<i>Just hurry up
before I change my mind.</i>

47:01.305 --> 47:02.306
You were there...

47:02.707 --> 47:04.373
on the bike.

47:05.577 --> 47:06.709
Just wait a minute.

47:06.711 --> 47:07.976
Just, just...

47:07.978 --> 47:09.444
You were fucking there!

47:09.446 --> 47:12.414
Okay, okay, okay! I was, I was!
Look I owe a hundred grand.

47:12.416 --> 47:14.950
Okay? And I didn't know where to turn.
They gave me a fucking week!

47:14.952 --> 47:16.652
All right? And I had
a friend with a boat.

47:16.654 --> 47:17.787
We did the same thing
you guys did.

47:17.789 --> 47:19.388
We were stupid. We thought
we could avoid the border.

47:19.390 --> 47:21.022
But we got robbed
and I couldn't cover it.

47:21.024 --> 47:22.692
- You piece of shit...
- No, no, no, please, please.

47:22.694 --> 47:24.025
Look, it was...
it was my idea.

47:24.027 --> 47:25.327
Chris was just
trying to help me.

47:25.329 --> 47:26.528
He didn't even want me
to come this morning.

47:26.530 --> 47:28.363
But I told him that I wouldn't
let him do it without me.

47:28.365 --> 47:29.632
They would've killed me,
all right?

47:29.634 --> 47:32.169
He felt like it was his fault.
He was just trying to save me.

47:35.406 --> 47:37.141
Ah!

47:48.887 --> 47:51.119
<i>God and she could
cry, Chris, let me tell you,</i>

47:51.121 --> 47:52.287
<i>from the moment
she woke up,</i>

47:52.289 --> 47:53.623
till the moment
we put her to bed.

47:53.625 --> 47:55.223
And Lizzie
wasn't like that. See?

47:55.225 --> 47:57.125
Lizzie... Lizzie was a dream.

47:57.127 --> 47:58.561
Anyway, this one night...

47:58.563 --> 48:00.195
And we hadn't slept in days

48:00.197 --> 48:02.063
at this point...
Fuckface in there

48:02.065 --> 48:03.599
says, "Screw it.
I'm getting out of here."

48:03.601 --> 48:04.767
And goes over
to his buddy's place.

48:04.769 --> 48:06.569
Anyway, eventually,

48:06.571 --> 48:08.336
he comes back
and he goes over to the crib,

48:08.338 --> 48:09.538
'cause we had the crib in there
at this point,

48:09.540 --> 48:11.375
and he goes over there
to give her a kiss.

48:12.543 --> 48:13.609
And she's not there.

48:13.611 --> 48:14.610
She's sound asleep
at this point.

48:14.612 --> 48:16.779
Yeah. No, no, I am passed out
on the couch.

48:16.781 --> 48:18.547
I am gone. So he comes over

48:18.549 --> 48:20.282
and shakes me, like,
"Where the hell is Maddie?"

48:20.284 --> 48:22.184
And, I... I don't know.
I thought she was in her crib.

48:22.186 --> 48:23.518
Right, so...

48:23.520 --> 48:25.320
Well, we started
tearing up the house.

48:25.322 --> 48:27.623
And we're looking under the beds
and in the bathtub.

48:27.625 --> 48:29.659
- In the cupboards.
- Yeah, we did. We did, actually.

48:29.661 --> 48:31.092
- We looked in the cupboards.
- What...

48:31.094 --> 48:31.993
We looked everywhere.

48:31.995 --> 48:34.296
And so finally,
he... he looks at me,

48:34.298 --> 48:35.363
like, "Well,
where the fuck is she?

48:35.365 --> 48:37.199
"She didn't just walk out
the fucking front door."

48:37.201 --> 48:38.433
And I'm like,
"Well, she was right here

48:38.435 --> 48:39.669
"with me on the couch!"

48:41.706 --> 48:44.574
And sure enough, we both turn,

48:44.576 --> 48:46.241
and I ran over there,

48:46.243 --> 48:49.377
and I reached my hand in
and I can feel her little arm.

48:49.379 --> 48:50.445
- Jesus.
- God!

48:50.447 --> 48:51.581
And I haul her out of there.

48:51.583 --> 48:54.382
And right away,
I start doing CPR.

48:54.384 --> 48:56.351
And at this point,
I'm crying my eyes out.

48:56.353 --> 48:58.453
And he's crying his eyes out,
and we're both wrecks.

48:58.455 --> 49:00.489
But I just keep blowing.

49:00.491 --> 49:01.657
And blowing and blowing.

49:01.659 --> 49:03.425
And then all of a sudden,

49:03.427 --> 49:05.128
I hear a little cough.

49:08.465 --> 49:09.832
God! And I lean back,

49:09.834 --> 49:13.170
and that... that is
when I hear it, Chris.

49:14.071 --> 49:15.105
She starts crying.

49:16.440 --> 49:18.574
And to this day, I swear to God,

49:18.576 --> 49:20.444
that is the sweetest sound
I ever heard.

49:22.446 --> 49:23.581
Mommy's little angel.

49:24.281 --> 49:25.347
Ain't that nuts?

49:25.349 --> 49:26.749
Yeah, that was crazy.

49:26.751 --> 49:29.284
You don't want kids, Chris?

49:29.286 --> 49:32.022
Uh, no. I don't think so.

49:46.838 --> 49:48.472
Hey, man.
Can I nab one of those?

49:49.540 --> 49:50.740
Didn't know you smoked.

49:50.742 --> 49:52.175
Yeah, I don't.

49:52.744 --> 49:54.109
Thanks.

49:55.045 --> 49:56.846
All right, I'm gonna go
change this one.

49:56.848 --> 49:59.114
- Nice to see you, Chris.
- Yeah, you too.

49:59.116 --> 50:00.384
- Can I get... Can I get a light?
- Yeah.

50:01.786 --> 50:04.556
Oh!

50:05.255 --> 50:07.389
This ain't personal. All right?

50:07.391 --> 50:08.724
You should've
called me first is all.

50:19.236 --> 50:20.435
Hey!

50:20.437 --> 50:21.573
What are you doing?

50:24.842 --> 50:26.508
Where's Jeremy?

50:26.510 --> 50:27.745
What did you do with him?

50:28.145 --> 50:29.511
Where is he?

50:29.513 --> 50:30.713
What about the bag?

50:30.715 --> 50:31.781
- Hey!
- The bag?

50:33.885 --> 50:35.285
Ah...

50:46.931 --> 50:48.664
Oh, thank God.

50:48.666 --> 50:50.200
- Joe...
- Mr. Davis?

50:51.301 --> 50:52.668
I need your help.

50:52.670 --> 50:54.235
What's happening
doesn't matter.

50:54.237 --> 50:55.771
Just need your help.
Okay, son?

50:55.773 --> 50:56.839
I need your help.

50:58.508 --> 51:00.444
- Wait! Wait!
- Ah!

51:01.278 --> 51:03.213
Whoa! Whoa! Relax!

51:04.381 --> 51:06.214
Just relax!

51:06.216 --> 51:07.783
I told you to that
we have the bags.

51:07.785 --> 51:09.250
We have them.

51:09.252 --> 51:10.853
And we can take you
to them right now.

51:10.855 --> 51:12.220
What did you do with Lori?

51:12.222 --> 51:13.256
She's by a farm.

51:13.858 --> 51:14.859
Believe me.

51:16.661 --> 51:18.426
She fell off the bike.

51:18.428 --> 51:21.664
I... I... I couldn't get her
or the bags.

51:21.666 --> 51:23.333
So you fucking left her there?

51:25.202 --> 51:26.370
- Yeah.
- Fucking...

51:34.277 --> 51:36.544
If you are lying to me,
so help me God,

51:36.546 --> 51:37.747
We're gonna take you
to the bags.

51:37.749 --> 51:38.883
We'll take you there right now.

51:41.719 --> 51:43.819
See? See? Hey!

51:43.821 --> 51:46.789
Hey! Everything is cool.

51:49.694 --> 51:51.560
Okay, okay.

51:51.562 --> 51:54.599
You take me to the fucking bags.
All right? Let's go.

52:00.972 --> 52:02.470
I didn't wanna do this.

52:02.472 --> 52:03.839
Okay.

52:03.841 --> 52:05.340
I will bring
the money back here.

52:05.342 --> 52:06.408
You understand me?

52:06.410 --> 52:07.511
Okay.

52:21.759 --> 52:22.760
Go.

53:29.594 --> 53:30.728
Ah...

53:39.837 --> 53:40.938
Okay.

54:06.798 --> 54:07.863
Fuck.

54:40.665 --> 54:41.766
Answer it.

54:43.734 --> 54:44.735
Answer it!

54:48.438 --> 54:50.139
- Hey.
- Where are you?

54:51.075 --> 54:52.041
<i>I, uh... I'm with
him now.</i>

54:52.043 --> 54:53.845
We're going to get the bags.
Are you okay?

55:01.518 --> 55:02.720
He beat me.

55:03.554 --> 55:05.723
My face, man.
It's all fucked up.

55:07.758 --> 55:09.794
Everything's
gonna be all right.

55:14.464 --> 55:16.033
I told him.

55:18.002 --> 55:20.004
I told him everything. I had to.

55:24.842 --> 55:26.010
We're here.

55:31.182 --> 55:32.081
I gotta go.

55:32.083 --> 55:34.884
Look, I never meant to do it.
All right?

55:34.886 --> 55:36.719
I never meant
to get you involved in this.

55:36.721 --> 55:38.854
Yeah. Look, it's okay.
It's... It's okay.

55:38.856 --> 55:39.722
All right? It's fine.

55:39.724 --> 55:41.023
Just... Just stay
where you are, okay?

55:41.025 --> 55:43.659
Just... Just wait for me there.
Okay, I gotta go, I gotta go.

55:43.661 --> 55:45.096
I'm really sorry, okay?

55:54.906 --> 55:56.107
You never meant to do what?

56:01.913 --> 56:02.914
What happened to you?

56:04.181 --> 56:05.182
Sorry.

56:22.800 --> 56:23.801
What the fuck are you doing?

56:26.037 --> 56:27.102
Get out.

56:29.506 --> 56:30.507
Get out!

56:50.895 --> 56:51.896
Ugh!

56:54.699 --> 56:56.231
Here we are.

56:56.233 --> 56:57.967
It's about 20 feet in,
bag's with her.

56:57.969 --> 56:58.970
Okay, show me.

57:01.706 --> 57:02.707
Show me.

57:47.218 --> 57:48.283
Wait, okay, wait...

57:48.285 --> 57:50.052
Hey! Where the fuck is it?

57:50.054 --> 57:51.687
Wait, wait, wait!

57:51.689 --> 57:53.022
Right fucking now!

57:53.024 --> 57:54.723
I'm gonna put bullet
in his fucking head!

57:54.725 --> 57:55.791
Wait!

57:55.793 --> 57:56.859
- Lori.
- You wait.

57:56.861 --> 57:58.093
Tell me where she is.

57:58.095 --> 57:59.928
I will fucking shoot him
right now.

57:59.930 --> 58:02.064
Fine, fine, alright. it all
looks the same in here.

58:02.066 --> 58:03.899
and I'm trying to
understand how to find her.

58:03.901 --> 58:05.768
Would you just follow me?
Please.

58:05.770 --> 58:07.738
Just give me the benefit
of doubt, I promise you.

58:08.305 --> 58:09.306
Stop!

58:12.643 --> 58:14.610
Run, Dad, run!

58:14.612 --> 58:15.613
Run Chris!

58:21.752 --> 58:22.753
Chris!

58:23.054 --> 58:24.055
Chris!

58:42.239 --> 58:43.307
Fuck!

58:50.181 --> 58:51.248
Uh...

58:53.117 --> 58:54.118
Fuck.

01:00:07.758 --> 01:00:08.759
Hi, hey.

01:00:09.226 --> 01:00:10.359
Hey, you're alive.

01:00:10.361 --> 01:00:11.760
Oh, my God. Are you hurt bad?

01:00:11.762 --> 01:00:14.029
- I'm so sorry.
- Where were you?

01:00:14.031 --> 01:00:15.898
No, you're okay.
You're not gonna die

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:18.267
You're not gonna die, I promise
you I'm gonna help you.

01:00:18.269 --> 01:00:20.169
Okay, come on.
Alright, okay.

01:00:27.845 --> 01:00:29.178
You're gonna be alright.

01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:30.181
You're gonna be alright.

01:00:35.786 --> 01:00:37.154
I need you to be quiet.

01:00:41.125 --> 01:00:42.126
It's alright.

01:00:45.129 --> 01:00:46.130
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:00:52.803 --> 01:00:54.738
We gotta call ambulance.

01:00:55.906 --> 01:00:56.907
She's still alive.

01:00:58.142 --> 01:00:59.208
Get away from her.

01:00:59.210 --> 01:01:00.275
We can help her.

01:01:00.277 --> 01:01:01.278
Get away from her!

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:06.515
Just listen, it's not too late.

01:01:06.517 --> 01:01:07.718
Please?

01:01:09.086 --> 01:01:10.152
I'm sorry.

01:01:10.154 --> 01:01:11.155
You're still alive.

01:01:14.091 --> 01:01:15.424
You're okay?

01:01:15.426 --> 01:01:16.427
Okay, buddy.

01:01:17.461 --> 01:01:18.561
Oh, fuck!

01:01:18.563 --> 01:01:19.895
Oh, Jesus.

01:01:19.897 --> 01:01:20.898
Oh, fuck!

01:01:24.802 --> 01:01:25.803
Fuck!

01:01:39.049 --> 01:01:40.115
I got it, Dad.

01:01:40.117 --> 01:01:41.118
I got it, Dad.

01:01:42.519 --> 01:01:43.520
Hey.

01:01:44.589 --> 01:01:45.789
Dad?

01:01:46.558 --> 01:01:48.056
I got it, Dad.

01:01:48.058 --> 01:01:49.059
Dad, I got...

01:01:52.096 --> 01:01:53.197
Help!

01:01:55.532 --> 01:01:56.533
Dad?

01:01:58.936 --> 01:01:59.937
Help me, Chris.

01:02:01.071 --> 01:02:02.072
Help me.

01:02:43.314 --> 01:02:44.315
Uh, Dad.

01:02:46.517 --> 01:02:48.185
Hey, hey.

01:02:49.219 --> 01:02:50.352
I got you man.

01:02:50.354 --> 01:02:51.989
I'm gonna help
you up, okay?

01:02:54.559 --> 01:02:56.325
Okay. Okay.

01:02:56.327 --> 01:02:58.327
Alright, Upon three

01:02:58.329 --> 01:03:00.898
One, two, three.

01:03:11.241 --> 01:03:12.307
Okay.

01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:13.442
We gotta go 'cause...

01:03:13.444 --> 01:03:15.613
'cause someone... someone
might have heard the shots.

01:03:17.014 --> 01:03:18.347
Okay, so.

01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:20.351
Just stay here. And the...

01:03:20.951 --> 01:03:22.117
I'll ha...

01:03:22.119 --> 01:03:23.120
I'll be back, just stay here

01:04:23.715 --> 01:04:25.015
Okay.

01:04:26.283 --> 01:04:27.351
Okay?

01:04:49.641 --> 01:04:51.643
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

01:05:13.598 --> 01:05:17.201
One, two, three.

01:05:27.110 --> 01:05:28.479
Two, three.

01:05:37.521 --> 01:05:38.556
Get him up.

01:06:00.444 --> 01:06:01.646
Fucking.

01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:14.525
Okay.

01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:18.460
Dad. Where you going? Dad?

01:06:18.462 --> 01:06:19.631
I'll be right back.

01:06:30.274 --> 01:06:31.676
You need these right?

01:06:57.569 --> 01:06:58.803
Watch her head.

01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:05.142
Alright.

01:07:15.687 --> 01:07:17.387
Is that it? I think so.

01:07:19.591 --> 01:07:20.758
What are we gonna do with them?

01:07:22.694 --> 01:07:24.459
I gotta drop you back
to the car.

01:07:24.461 --> 01:07:25.830
I'll handle it, I know a place.

01:07:56.661 --> 01:07:58.362
Why didn't you just come to us?

01:08:00.397 --> 01:08:01.666
And say what?

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:04.636
Is he okay?

01:08:05.870 --> 01:08:07.770
Do you even know where he is?

01:08:07.772 --> 01:08:09.139
I think so.

01:08:10.642 --> 01:08:12.242
I think so.

01:08:27.892 --> 01:08:29.359
Is it because we made him leave?

01:08:32.261 --> 01:08:33.462
You didn't do anything.

01:08:35.332 --> 01:08:36.932
No, something's not working

01:08:36.934 --> 01:08:38.636
for both of you
to have done this.

01:08:44.709 --> 01:08:46.176
You did nothing.

01:08:55.819 --> 01:08:56.921
Let's go.

01:08:58.555 --> 01:08:59.590
Come on.

01:09:51.676 --> 01:09:53.845
- So how will I know?
- Just call me.

01:09:59.349 --> 01:10:00.549
You have my number?

01:10:00.551 --> 01:10:01.819
Yeah, I got it.

01:10:06.958 --> 01:10:08.025
You were right.

01:10:11.829 --> 01:10:12.830
About what you said.

01:10:17.101 --> 01:10:18.703
He was the only friend
I had, Dad.

01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:23.975
They both were.

01:10:27.477 --> 01:10:28.713
This is what I did to them.

01:10:41.491 --> 01:10:42.693
Are you okay?

01:10:45.663 --> 01:10:47.730
- Are you sure you can do this?
- Yeah.

01:10:47.732 --> 01:10:49.299
- Because I can.
- No, Dad, no,

01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:56.941
- Good.
- Dad.

01:11:03.748 --> 01:11:05.016
I know you didn't want me to go.

01:11:09.687 --> 01:11:10.755
I chose to go.

01:14:57.715 --> 01:14:58.749
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:14:59.450 --> 01:15:01.252
I've been trying to reach you.

01:15:01.786 --> 01:15:03.252
Sorry

01:15:03.254 --> 01:15:04.955
Did you get my message?

01:15:06.657 --> 01:15:08.225
Jeremy was attacked earlier.

01:15:14.732 --> 01:15:15.966
I heard.

01:15:18.836 --> 01:15:20.104
I found him at Dad's

01:15:21.405 --> 01:15:22.640
Is...

01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:24.640
Is he okay?

01:15:24.642 --> 01:15:26.143
No. No, not really.

01:15:27.945 --> 01:15:29.244
Where is he?

01:15:29.246 --> 01:15:30.312
He's upstairs. No, don't.

01:15:30.314 --> 01:15:31.814
Just...

01:15:31.816 --> 01:15:33.215
Just leave him.

01:15:33.217 --> 01:15:34.718
Let's keep him here.

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:38.589
Okay? Let's just keep
him here with us.

01:15:41.926 --> 01:15:43.661
I don't wanna make
the same mistake again.

01:15:48.299 --> 01:15:49.600
Okay.

01:15:54.305 --> 01:15:56.807
Is... Chris okay?

01:16:08.052 --> 01:16:09.286
Hmm.
