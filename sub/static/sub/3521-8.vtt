01:50.126 --> 01:53.129
In the czech republic, too,
we love pork.

01:53.246 --> 01:55.748
Ever had our sausages?

02:01.254 --> 02:04.757
In the czech republic, too,
we love pork.

02:04.757 --> 02:07.760
You ever had our sausages?

02:28.665 --> 02:31.784
- Adriana?
- In the czech republic, too,
we love pork.

02:31.918 --> 02:33.920
Ever had our sausages?

02:38.291 --> 02:41.294
Emil kolar?

02:41.294 --> 02:45.798
- Help you?
- Salami sub, hold the mayo.

02:45.798 --> 02:47.800
We're out of mayo.

02:51.304 --> 02:53.806
Change my meat
to black forest.

03:03.950 --> 03:06.953
- You killed me.
- What do you want me
to do about it now?

03:06.953 --> 03:10.456
- I wanna tell you.
- Tell me what?
You come here every night.

03:10.456 --> 03:13.459
- You fucked up.
- What do you mean?

03:15.211 --> 03:17.213
Here's these.

03:17.330 --> 03:18.831
Where did you find'em?

03:19.332 --> 03:22.335
One in the table.
Three in my skull.

03:24.837 --> 03:27.340
You will have our sausages.

03:27.340 --> 03:30.226
Get rid of these.

03:30.226 --> 03:32.729
Let go of me! Let go!

03:44.490 --> 03:46.492
I would have wrapped it, but--
that's okay.
A computer!

03:46.993 --> 03:50.496
This model got such a good
write- up, i got one for myself.
You're gonna love it.

03:50.496 --> 03:54.000
Let's move on, okay?
Congratulations.
God bless.

03:59.756 --> 04:02.258
Hon, you look gorgeous.
By the way,
who's your date?

04:02.258 --> 04:05.762
I'll give you "who's
your date." come here.
Good to see you.

04:05.762 --> 04:07.764
Congratulations.
Thank you.

04:07.764 --> 04:10.266
Melissa was beautiful
up there.
I know. Thank you.

04:10.266 --> 04:12.769
Oh, mama livia.
Come esta, darling?

04:13.269 --> 04:18.274
Listen to him with
that "my darling."
I am nobody's darling.

04:18.274 --> 04:20.777
This one here,
she never disappoints ya,
i'll tell ya that.

04:20.777 --> 04:23.780
Are you still seeing
your other women, lorenzo?

04:23.780 --> 04:26.282
Come on, ma.
Let's mingle.

04:26.282 --> 04:28.284
Sorry. The older she gets,
the worse she gets.

04:28.785 --> 04:31.788
Ah. Listen. I heard
some disturbing shit
last night.

04:31.788 --> 04:35.792
I wanted to talk to you about
it. But with the rehearsal
dinner and everything, it just--

04:35.792 --> 04:38.294
yeah.
I-- there's
the priest, though.

04:38.294 --> 04:40.296
I'll be right back.
Go ahead.

04:46.302 --> 04:50.807
Yeah! Whoo!

04:51.174 --> 04:53.676
Salute!

04:53.676 --> 04:55.678
Federal indictments?
Yeah.

04:55.678 --> 04:58.181
Where the fuck
you get this?
I got a guy who owes me.

04:58.181 --> 05:02.185
He's got agoomatowho
works at f. B. I. Headquarters
as a word processor.

05:02.185 --> 05:06.689
When's it comin' down?
I don't know. When she
knows, she'll tell me.

05:06.689 --> 05:09.575
Indictments? What the fuck
you talkin' about?
You sure about this?

05:09.575 --> 05:14.080
It ain't just my source in
jersey. Half of new york moved
to fort lauderdale already.

05:14.197 --> 05:16.699
Fuck. They're gonna
want my ass.

05:16.699 --> 05:20.703
Why?
What do you mean, why?
I'm o. C.

05:20.703 --> 05:24.207
When'd you get
your fuckin' wings?
I didn't.

05:24.707 --> 05:27.210
Not yet anyway.

05:27.593 --> 05:30.596
Uncle junior, you got anything
you wanna say about this?

05:30.596 --> 05:33.599
You guys see indictments
under your bed at night.

05:33.599 --> 05:37.103
Right away you're ready to lam
it. As far as i'm concerned,
it's just speculation.

05:37.103 --> 05:41.107
- It's rumor.
- Better be safe
than sorry, no?

05:41.107 --> 05:44.110
I say we duck for a while.
And what are we gonna do?

05:44.227 --> 05:45.728
Close shop?
We can't do that.

05:46.229 --> 05:47.980
Tony, what do you think?

05:47.980 --> 05:52.985
What the fuck you askin'
him for? I just--
i just gave you the answer.

05:52.985 --> 05:55.488
Junior's right. We go on
the lam now, it's open season.

05:55.488 --> 05:58.991
The fuckin' albanians
will be livin' in our houses.
Fuck!

05:58.991 --> 06:00.993
I just gave a g- note to
larry boy's kid for the boost.

06:00.993 --> 06:03.996
If i knew i may have to lam
in a hurry, i would've duked
her another time.

06:12.505 --> 06:15.258
Thank you, darlin'.
Gotta go.

06:15.758 --> 06:18.261
Say good- bye
to your father for me.

06:19.762 --> 06:23.766
I agree with my uncle.
He calls the shots,
we do it.

06:23.766 --> 06:26.769
But maybe, for today,
for right now...

06:27.270 --> 06:30.773
you were thinkin', uncle jun,
that everybody should do
a little spring cleaning.

06:31.023 --> 06:33.526
That was my next comment.

06:41.033 --> 06:43.035
We're goin' right now.
Let's go.

06:44.537 --> 06:47.039
Come on. We have to go.

07:07.810 --> 07:10.813
Think they're gonna come
over the weekend?

07:10.813 --> 07:13.316
They're comin' someday.

07:17.820 --> 07:20.323
- Where's the rest of the money?
- It's everywhere.

07:20.323 --> 07:22.825
Well, get it.

07:24.327 --> 07:27.830
What else?
How'bout your phone numbers?

07:27.830 --> 07:29.832
Anybody who's anybody
is in my head.

07:35.721 --> 07:37.723
What's the matter?

07:37.840 --> 07:40.843
Nothin'.
Just here we go.

07:40.843 --> 07:44.347
Here.
Why now?

07:44.480 --> 07:47.600
Why the fuck now, just
when things we're goin' good?

07:55.241 --> 07:57.994
Boot your computer.
The cops are coming.

07:58.494 --> 08:01.998
- So?
- You want them to see all that
porno you downloaded?

08:01.998 --> 08:04.500
Shit!

08:12.258 --> 08:14.260
You better give me
your jewelry.

08:14.260 --> 08:17.263
Jesus.
Hey.

08:17.263 --> 08:21.767
They know we can't produce
receipts. You want'em stealing
this shit from us?

08:25.388 --> 08:29.892
Come on.
I'm not giving you my engagement
ring. This isn't stolen.

08:31.394 --> 08:37.033
Is it?
No. What do you
think i am?

08:38.534 --> 08:40.653
Come on.
Give me that.

09:07.563 --> 09:09.565
Adriana!

09:11.067 --> 09:13.569
It ate my whole script now!

09:16.572 --> 09:18.574
You're still on the file.

09:18.574 --> 09:20.576
You must've deleted
the text.

09:20.576 --> 09:23.079
What the fuck--
whatever, whatev--
you fuckin' asshole!

09:23.079 --> 09:26.582
All right, stop
with the hysteria,
would you, please?

09:26.582 --> 09:30.586
If you're gonna keep behavin'
like a baby, fuck it, i'm not
gonna help you, christopher.

09:31.087 --> 09:35.091
- I mean it.
- At least you work that squirrel
program in the restaurant.

09:38.094 --> 09:40.596
There.
The text came back.

09:41.097 --> 09:44.600
You put it in
buffer memory.
What do you think?

09:44.600 --> 09:47.103
Of the script?

09:47.103 --> 09:50.606
Babe, i can't like give
an opinion every time
you add a sentence.

09:50.606 --> 09:53.109
I gotta have
the whole story flow.

09:53.109 --> 09:55.611
I'm startin' with the dialogue.

10:05.121 --> 10:08.624
"Imanugedto get
the drop on him"?

10:08.624 --> 10:11.627
Do you mean to say,
"imanagedto get
the drop on him"?

10:11.627 --> 10:15.631
Or is he saying"manuge,"
like"manugia l'american"?

10:24.140 --> 10:26.642
My tennessee william.

10:31.147 --> 10:33.649
Where you goin'?

10:33.649 --> 10:35.651
Get over here.

10:37.153 --> 10:40.656
I have never seen you
apply yourself like this.

10:40.656 --> 10:43.659
I love movies.
You know that.

10:44.160 --> 10:47.663
That smell in blockbuster,
that candy and carpet smell,

10:48.164 --> 10:50.166
i get high off it.

10:50.166 --> 10:54.170
I'm gonna let all this
love and knowledge
go to waste?

10:54.170 --> 10:57.673
My cousin gregory's
girlfriend amy, the one that
works for tarantino, said,

10:57.673 --> 11:00.176
"mob stories
are always hot."

11:00.676 --> 11:03.679
I can make my mark.

11:03.679 --> 11:06.182
Babe,
with these indictments,

11:06.682 --> 11:11.187
shouldn't you put
the script away for a while
and get rid of evidence?

11:12.688 --> 11:15.691
Travel light.
Free bird.

11:15.691 --> 11:19.695
You stole this computer,
plus the one
you just gave melissa.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.702
- I'm writing!
- Turn on channel 6.

11:26.702 --> 11:28.704
Turn on channel 6.

11:31.707 --> 11:35.711
New jersey attorney general
james d. Ricci stated
at a fund- raiser...

11:35.711 --> 11:38.714
that a grand jury has been
impanelled to investigate...

11:38.714 --> 11:42.718
possible mob activities
in the garden state,
with indictments to follow.

11:43.085 --> 11:46.839
With us is syndicated columnist
and author ofmafia:

11:47.339 --> 11:50.342
America's longest running
soap opera, jeffrey wernick.

11:50.342 --> 11:52.845
First of all, welcome.
Thank you.
Pleasure to be here.

11:52.978 --> 11:56.982
For years now, the f. B. I.
Has been telling us that
the mafia is all but dead.

11:57.483 --> 12:00.486
Let me interject.
While it is true...

12:00.486 --> 12:03.489
that the mob is getting
a standing- eight count,

12:03.489 --> 12:05.491
uh, i wouldn't call
the fight.

12:05.491 --> 12:07.993
The government knows this
better than anyone.

12:07.993 --> 12:12.498
Murder, truck hijacking as well
as money laundering are expected
to be among the inquiries.

12:12.498 --> 12:15.000
Do we know yet
the names of those
who will be indicted?

12:15.501 --> 12:17.002
Well, the indictments
are sealed.

12:17.503 --> 12:21.006
But with the recent death
of acting di meo family boss,
jackie aprile,

12:21.006 --> 12:25.010
my sources tell me that
corrado "junior" soprano...

12:25.127 --> 12:27.630
was made new boss
after the death of aprile.

12:27.630 --> 12:32.768
The sopranos have
long historic ties to
the new york families.

12:32.768 --> 12:35.271
What about these possible
murder charges?

12:35.271 --> 12:39.024
They will undoubtedly
be focused on
the as- yet- unsolved...

12:39.525 --> 12:43.395
execution- style slaying
of soprano family associate,
brendan filone.

12:43.395 --> 12:47.399
Uh, was it part
of a power struggle?
Interesting.

12:47.900 --> 12:50.402
No one would ever have
ranked him as associate!
My associates tell me that...

12:50.786 --> 12:54.290
filone is a loyal soldier, if
you will, and he winds up dead--
soldier?

12:54.290 --> 12:57.660
Brendan filone!
Associate? Soldier?

12:58.160 --> 13:00.162
Fuck you!
Jesus.

13:08.671 --> 13:13.175
Georgie, did you see it
from the beginning?
Did they mention my name?

13:13.676 --> 13:17.680
No-- stop the fuckin'
chitchat, all right.
I gotta go. I gotta go.

13:22.685 --> 13:25.688
Nobody makes "ginzo" gravy
like you, nana.

13:25.688 --> 13:29.191
You know, i'm up at bard
waiting for my care package.

13:29.191 --> 13:31.193
I don't like
that word, jason.

13:31.193 --> 13:34.079
- What? Ginzo?
- The word is offensive.

13:34.079 --> 13:37.583
She's right, jason.
It's not a nice word.
Sorry, nana.

13:37.583 --> 13:39.702
- What's it mean?
- Derived from the word
"guinea."

13:39.702 --> 13:42.955
- What's that mean?
- It's a derogation.

13:43.455 --> 13:46.458
I have a patient,
you wouldn't wanna say the word
"guinea" in front of him.

13:46.959 --> 13:48.961
Huh, italian male
seeing a shrink.

13:48.961 --> 13:51.463
Let me guess.
Mother issues.

13:51.463 --> 13:53.966
- Why wouldn't you say it, mom?
- You just wouldn't.

13:53.966 --> 13:57.970
What, you'd be scared?
Is he in the mafia?
I shouldn't have mentioned it.

13:57.970 --> 13:59.972
Can't we change
the subject?

14:00.472 --> 14:03.475
No way. What's he do, mom?
Is he in the mob or what?

14:03.475 --> 14:05.477
He's not a mobster,
is he, jen?

14:05.477 --> 14:09.982
Nobody knows better
than you, richard,
i can't discuss my patients.

14:09.982 --> 14:13.986
I just hope he's not
one of those crumbs they're
talkin' about on the news.

14:13.986 --> 14:18.490
Jen, just refer him
to another doctor. You could
do that, couldn't you?

14:18.991 --> 14:23.245
- Grate the cheese, dad, okay?
- Sure she can.

14:23.245 --> 14:25.748
That might be what
you would do, richard.

14:25.748 --> 14:28.751
Now i remember why
we got divorced.

14:29.001 --> 14:32.504
Why should i refer him
to another doctor?
He's my patient.

14:32.504 --> 14:34.139
You know you can't treat
sociopaths.

14:34.139 --> 14:36.141
He's scum and you shouldn't
help him with his bed- wetting.

14:36.141 --> 14:40.145
You have no idea
who this man is,
and yet you call him scum.

14:40.145 --> 14:43.649
People like him are
the reason italian- americans
have such a bad image.

14:43.649 --> 14:49.154
I agree.
Ask any american to describe
an italian- american,

14:49.154 --> 14:53.659
and invariably he's gonna
referencethe godfather,
goodfellas.

14:54.159 --> 14:57.162
Good movies.
And the rest
are gonna mention pizza.

14:57.162 --> 14:59.164
Good movies
to eat pizza by.

14:59.164 --> 15:02.668
Stop it, jason.
I never said he was
in the mafia.

15:03.168 --> 15:05.170
Why do you think we're never
gonna see an italian president?

15:05.170 --> 15:07.172
And that's
my patient's fault?

15:07.172 --> 15:11.677
- Hey.
- I realize you're very involved
in the antidefamation lobby.

15:11.677 --> 15:16.682
So go after hollywood if you
feel you absolutely have to,
but leave my patient alone.

15:16.682 --> 15:21.687
It's a synergy. News items
and the constant portrayal of
italian- americans as gangsters.

15:21.687 --> 15:27.192
Wasn't the italian antidef deal
started by joe colombo,
a mobster?

15:27.192 --> 15:29.695
Italians against discrimination
did a study,

15:30.195 --> 15:33.315
and in its height,
the mafia in this country
had less than 5, 000 members.

15:33.315 --> 15:36.702
And yet, that tiny,
insignificant fraction...

15:36.702 --> 15:41.206
cast such a dark shadow
over 20 million
hard- working americans.

15:41.323 --> 15:43.325
Dad, at this point
in our cultural history,

15:43.325 --> 15:46.829
mob movies are classic
american cinema,
like westerns.

15:47.329 --> 15:49.832
I have to agree there, rich.
You know,

15:50.332 --> 15:52.334
you never saw that scotch- irish
pissin' and moanin'...

15:52.718 --> 15:56.221
about always bein' portrayed
as, as rustlers
and gunslingers.

15:56.338 --> 15:59.842
That's absurd.
See what you started
with your gravy, nana?

15:59.842 --> 16:03.846
To we,
the 20 million.

16:03.979 --> 16:05.981
- Salute.
- Salute.

16:06.098 --> 16:09.351
Salute.

16:23.749 --> 16:27.503
- What?

16:27.870 --> 16:30.756
- Get down here right away.
We're exterminatin'.
- I'm kind of busy now.

16:30.873 --> 16:32.875
And get some sfogliatelle
and cannoli and shit
for the guys.

16:33.125 --> 16:35.127
Yeah.

16:48.524 --> 16:51.527
Twenty- nine.

16:58.784 --> 17:01.286
Here you go, big guy.
Thank you.

17:10.546 --> 17:12.047
Hey, gino.
What can i get you?

17:12.414 --> 17:15.416
Give me some--
whoa, whoa.
Number 34, right here.

17:15.416 --> 17:18.170
He was in line.
He just went out to go
get gas in his car.

17:18.554 --> 17:22.558
Oh, so i could go out,
fuck your sister, come back
saturday, i go to the front?

17:22.925 --> 17:26.310
- I said he could.
- Hey, poppin' fresh,
i'm in no fuckin' mood today.

17:26.310 --> 17:29.314
I'm next.
Now get a fuckin' pastry box.

17:29.431 --> 17:31.433
Gino, what can i get ya?

17:31.683 --> 17:34.186
Oh!
It's all right, dougie.
Let him go first.

17:34.319 --> 17:36.438
No. He don't make
the rules here.

17:37.940 --> 17:40.325
All right, let me have
two neapolitan loaves--

17:40.576 --> 17:44.696
you touch a single fuckin'
crust, you're gonna wish you
took that job at mcdonald's.

17:44.696 --> 17:49.084
- Fuck you.
- Okay, take a walk.

17:49.084 --> 17:53.088
What about my bread?
You come back
in ten minutes.

17:53.205 --> 17:56.592
- What the fuck do you
think you're doin'?
- Come on.

18:03.966 --> 18:07.352
Come on. Get up.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

18:07.352 --> 18:10.856
What is it? What is it?
Do i look like a pussy to you?

18:11.356 --> 18:12.858
No.
I'm serious.
Be honest.

18:13.358 --> 18:15.360
I won't get mad.
No.

18:15.360 --> 18:19.364
Why the fuck would you give me
a hard time and talk to me like
i'm nothin' to worry about?

18:19.364 --> 18:21.867
I- i- i'm sorry.

18:21.867 --> 18:25.737
Get a pastry box.
Move it!

18:28.874 --> 18:31.877
That's better.
Now fill it...

18:31.877 --> 18:34.880
with cannoli, sfogliatelle
and napoleons.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.882
Okay.

18:38.884 --> 18:41.887
- Move!
-

18:43.889 --> 18:45.757
good.

18:48.260 --> 18:51.263
Give me the box.
Come on.

18:51.263 --> 18:53.515
Here.

18:59.521 --> 19:03.025
Next time you see my face,
show some respect.

19:03.025 --> 19:05.160
I will.

19:05.277 --> 19:08.914
You motherfucker!

19:08.914 --> 19:12.534
- You shot my foot!
- It happens.

19:12.534 --> 19:15.037
Oh, you fuckin' asshole!

19:19.925 --> 19:22.427
If i'm gettin' an invitation
to the dance,

19:22.427 --> 19:24.930
i wish the feds would hurry
the fuck up about it.

19:24.930 --> 19:26.932
You heard what
they're sayin' on the news.

19:26.932 --> 19:29.434
The way things are workin',
it's gonna be junior's party.

19:29.935 --> 19:32.437
That was a far- thinkin' plan
you had there, ton.

19:34.439 --> 19:37.442
I called you
last christmas.
Fuck this.

19:37.442 --> 19:41.446
Hey, the sfogliatelle.
What's wrong with you?

19:41.446 --> 19:44.950
What are you doin'?
Were you brought up
in a barn or what?

19:44.950 --> 19:48.453
What's the matter with you,
huh? This is no time to go
on the rag, christopher.

19:48.453 --> 19:51.957
Not with the indictment shit
comin' down.

19:51.957 --> 19:55.460
Take georgie,
go in the bathroom,
sweep for bugs, okay?

19:55.460 --> 19:57.462
Come on.

20:04.469 --> 20:06.972
Well, i hope
they'll be all right.

20:07.339 --> 20:10.726
- Who?
- The guys.

20:10.842 --> 20:12.477
- What about me?
- You'll be all right.

20:12.978 --> 20:15.097
They didn't even mention
your name on television.

20:15.097 --> 20:18.100
Fuckin' amazing,
though, huh?
You know what, that news guy,

20:18.100 --> 20:21.603
he said the words,"brendan
filone," i'm tellin' ya, the
hairs on the back of my neck,

20:22.104 --> 20:23.605
they fuckin' stood up.

20:24.106 --> 20:28.110
- I mean, i knew the guy.
- They made him look like
john fuckin' gotti.

20:28.110 --> 20:30.112
I brought him around here.

20:30.612 --> 20:34.116
Tony wouldn't have never
known him if it wasn't for me.

20:34.616 --> 20:37.252
Huh. I had no idea.

20:55.520 --> 20:59.141
Who is it?
I'm sleeping!

20:59.141 --> 21:02.144
Carmela.
Oh, come on in.

21:02.277 --> 21:06.782
I- i- i just said that in case
you were that snooty- ass...

21:06.782 --> 21:09.284
mrs. Ryan down the hall.

21:09.284 --> 21:14.289
Oh, she is so shanty irish,
and with all her airs.

21:14.289 --> 21:16.291
Come on. Get dressed.
I'm taking you to brunch.

21:16.792 --> 21:18.794
What?
You heard me.
Get dressed.

21:18.794 --> 21:23.298
What's wrong? Tell me.
Nothing is wrong, ma. Why does
something have to be wrong?

21:23.298 --> 21:25.050
Is it meadow?
She eats like a bird.

21:25.050 --> 21:28.553
Everything is fine, ma.
Relax. Nothing is wrong.

21:28.920 --> 21:33.425
But you come here unannounced.
And i- i shouldn't wonder
if something's wrong?

21:33.925 --> 21:36.061
Oh, jeez. I'm sorry.

21:36.061 --> 21:39.064
It's a nice day.
I thought i would
take you out.

21:41.433 --> 21:43.435
I don't wanna go out.

21:46.321 --> 21:48.824
Is it anthony?
Those indictments?

21:48.824 --> 21:51.326
His father could take it
in stride, but he can't.

21:51.827 --> 21:53.578
I don't believe you.

21:57.332 --> 22:00.085
- Come on, ma.
Will you get dressed?
- We just went to a wedding.

22:00.585 --> 22:04.589
That was a big to- do.
This way, you and me, we get
to spend some quality time.

22:07.092 --> 22:10.095
The manor is gonna stop
serving brunch any minute.

22:13.098 --> 22:16.101
Did he cheat on you again?

22:17.969 --> 22:21.473
You know,
i try to do something nice.
I come here to take you out.

22:21.973 --> 22:26.478
Right away you think
i have some other agenda that
i have to talk toyouabout?

22:26.478 --> 22:29.481
Don't flatter yourself.

22:29.481 --> 22:32.984
I'll, uh--
i'll throw something on.

22:36.488 --> 22:39.124
Buckle your seat belt, ma.

22:39.124 --> 22:42.627
I can't find it.
Where is it?

24:07.078 --> 24:10.332
It's not definite.
I just thought i'd tell ya,

24:10.332 --> 24:13.335
you know, in case i don't
show up for an appointment.

24:13.468 --> 24:15.971
So, you're telling me
that you're planning
a vacation,

24:15.971 --> 24:18.473
but you're not sure
exactly when it will be?

24:18.723 --> 24:21.226
Right.

24:21.726 --> 24:24.095
I may never go.

24:26.097 --> 24:28.099
Let's put it this way.

24:29.100 --> 24:32.354
There's a strong possibility
that it-- it could happen.

24:34.356 --> 24:38.994
Does this have anything
to do with what's been
on the news lately?

24:43.248 --> 24:46.251
So, if you, uh, suddenly stop
coming to your appointments,

24:46.251 --> 24:49.254
i will assume that
you are on vacation.

24:49.371 --> 24:52.374
And i should wait
to be contacted?

24:52.374 --> 24:56.127
That would be
a good assumption.

25:01.132 --> 25:04.636
Who is it?
Paulie.
Open the door.

25:24.155 --> 25:26.658
I thought we were
steppin' out.

25:28.159 --> 25:31.663
I got two broads in the car.
You said ad' went to stay
at her mother's.

25:36.668 --> 25:40.171
No wonder.
This place looks like
a fuckin' sty.

25:42.674 --> 25:45.927
What's wrong with you?

25:45.927 --> 25:48.680
Talk to me.
This ain't like you, kid.

25:51.316 --> 25:53.435
I ran into
billy cracchiolo.

25:53.435 --> 25:55.820
The meter maid?
What about him?

25:55.937 --> 25:58.940
Told me the regular cops
in nutley are lookin'
for a guy.

25:58.940 --> 26:02.444
Blew off a kid's toe
for no good reason
in russo's bakery.

26:02.944 --> 26:04.946
Drove a lexus.

26:08.450 --> 26:10.452
Does tony know about this?

26:11.453 --> 26:13.455
What's goin' on, chrissy?

26:13.955 --> 26:16.458
Been workin' my ass off
on this movie script.

26:16.958 --> 26:20.211
You know how many pages
i got? Nineteen.

26:21.212 --> 26:23.715
That a lot
or a little?

26:23.715 --> 26:27.218
Books say movie's supposed
to be about 120 pages.

26:27.218 --> 26:29.721
Got this fuckin' computer.
I thought it would
do a lot of it.

26:29.971 --> 26:31.973
You ain't bein' frank
about the business, kid?

26:32.357 --> 26:33.858
I would never do that.

26:34.359 --> 26:36.361
It's only "suggested by."
That writer,

26:36.861 --> 26:41.366
with the bullfights,
blew his own fuckin' head off.

26:41.366 --> 26:43.868
I bought a script- writin'
program and everything.

26:44.119 --> 26:47.122
My advice.
Put that thing down a while.

26:47.622 --> 26:49.124
We go get our joints copped,

26:49.624 --> 26:52.627
and tomorrow, the words
will come blowin' out your ass.

26:54.629 --> 26:57.132
You ever feel like
nothin' good was ever
gonna happen to you?

26:57.132 --> 26:59.634
Yeah. And nothin' did.
So what?

27:00.135 --> 27:01.636
I'm alive.
I'm survivin'.

27:02.137 --> 27:05.140
That's it.
I don't wanna just survive.

27:05.640 --> 27:10.145
Says in these movie- writing
books that every character
has an arc. You understand?

27:12.147 --> 27:14.149
Like everybody starts out
somewheres,

27:14.149 --> 27:17.652
and then they do somethin'
or somethin' gets done to them,
it changes their life.

27:17.652 --> 27:21.156
That's called their arc.
Where's my arc?

27:23.658 --> 27:27.412
Take richard kimble,
all right?

27:27.412 --> 27:31.916
No, that's no good.
His arc is run, run,
jump off a damn-- run.

27:31.916 --> 27:34.919
Uh--

27:34.919 --> 27:36.921
keanu reeves, devil's advocate.
You see that?

27:37.422 --> 27:39.424
Al.
Right.

27:40.925 --> 27:45.430
Keanu's a lawyer.
Gets all turned on by money,
power and the devil.

27:45.547 --> 27:49.551
Then his wife says to him,
"you're not the man i married."
Leaves him.

27:49.551 --> 27:51.803
You see the arc?

27:53.304 --> 27:57.809
He starts down here.
He ends up here.

27:57.809 --> 28:00.311
Where's my arc, paulie?

28:00.812 --> 28:04.315
Kid, richard kimble,

28:04.315 --> 28:06.818
thedevil'swhatever,
those are all make- believe.

28:06.951 --> 28:09.954
Hey, i got no arc either.

28:09.954 --> 28:13.458
I was born, grew up,
spent a few years in the army,

28:13.958 --> 28:16.461
a few more in the can
and here i am.

28:16.461 --> 28:18.463
A half a wise guy.
So what?

28:18.463 --> 28:20.832
I got no identity.

28:21.332 --> 28:25.336
I mean, even brendan filone's
got an identity. He's dead.

28:25.336 --> 28:28.840
I killed that fuckin'
emil kolar and nothin'.

28:28.840 --> 28:33.344
I don't even move up a notch.
All i got is nightmares.

28:33.344 --> 28:35.847
That polish, czech, slavic,
whatever the fuck he is,

28:35.847 --> 28:38.349
is hauntin' me in my dreams
every night.

28:38.850 --> 28:42.487
That happens.
The more of them you do,
the better you'll sleep.

28:42.487 --> 28:45.490
I had one prick chasin' me
for months in my dreams.

28:45.490 --> 28:47.992
I feel like he's tryin'
to tell me somethin'.

28:47.992 --> 28:50.995
That we fucked up
the night that we buried him.
We didn't fuck up.

28:50.995 --> 28:53.498
- That i'm in danger.
- Could i ask you a question?

28:53.498 --> 28:56.000
Why the fuck would he wanna
tell you you're in danger,

28:56.501 --> 28:59.504
considering you put
a fuckin' moon roof
in the back of his head?

28:59.754 --> 29:02.257
What did we do wrong
that night?

29:02.757 --> 29:05.760
The gun was hot,
so the slugs in his head
couldn't be traced back to me.

29:06.127 --> 29:08.763
You know who had an arc?
Noah.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.402
Is that him?

29:31.903 --> 29:35.540
Now that would be
some fuckin' coincidence
if it wasn't, wouldn't it?

29:38.042 --> 29:40.545
Holy shit!
Look at that!

29:40.545 --> 29:44.165
- What?
- He was clean shaven.
He's got a fuckin' beard now.

29:44.666 --> 29:46.668
You know what?
I read that. That happens.

29:47.051 --> 29:49.053
Jesus. I always thought
it was bullshit.

29:49.170 --> 29:51.172
Oh! Look
at his fingernails!

29:51.306 --> 29:55.677
- Oh, fuck!
They're like a woman's.
- I'm gonna fuckin' puke.

29:57.178 --> 29:59.180
All right, help me lift him.

29:59.180 --> 30:02.684
We'll take him down to
pine barons before they build
a fuckin' condo here.

30:02.684 --> 30:04.686
Georgie!

30:08.323 --> 30:10.325
I don't know about
selling this property.

30:10.825 --> 30:14.329
I don't know about you,
but i sure as hell
could use an infusion...

30:14.329 --> 30:17.332
if we're gonna support jas
after he graduates.

30:17.332 --> 30:22.337
It's funny how
even during our marriage
we saw things differently.

30:22.337 --> 30:26.457
I never saw this place
as an investment.

30:26.457 --> 30:28.960
I always thought
that we'd build a house.

30:30.461 --> 30:32.964
So, are we gonna sell
or what?

30:32.964 --> 30:34.966
For jason.

30:35.466 --> 30:39.354
But, you know, i don't wanna
hear that you took one of
your colleens on a cruise.

30:39.721 --> 30:42.223
What's that supposed to mean,
"colleens"?

30:42.473 --> 30:45.476
We all know you're a sucker
for those irish girls.

30:45.977 --> 30:50.114
Every italian boy
bows down to the freckles.
I married you.

30:50.365 --> 30:54.869
- Yeah, i was a mother figure.
- Don't bust my balls with freud
by numbers, would ya?

30:54.986 --> 30:58.623
"Don't bust my balls"?
Watch it, richard.
Yourcalibrazeis showing.

30:58.623 --> 31:00.625
What, are you somehow
implying by all this...

31:01.125 --> 31:03.628
i'm- i'm ashamed to be
an italian- american?

31:03.628 --> 31:06.130
With all the poverty,
starvation, ethnic cleansing...

31:06.130 --> 31:08.633
and generally horrible shit
in this world,

31:09.133 --> 31:13.388
you devote your energies
to the protection of the dignity
of connie francis.

31:15.390 --> 31:18.893
You know, you're all
worked up about my patient,

31:18.893 --> 31:23.398
a man who has no bearing
on who you are or where
you are in this world.

31:23.398 --> 31:26.517
Call him a patient.
The man's a criminal, jennifer.

31:26.517 --> 31:30.021
And after a while,
finally you're gonna get
beyond psychotherapy...

31:30.021 --> 31:32.523
with its cheesy
moral relativism.

31:32.523 --> 31:36.277
Finally, you're gonna get
to good and evil.
And he's evil.

31:58.433 --> 32:01.436
Sorry i'm late.
The alarm was--

32:01.436 --> 32:04.939
what the fuck is wrong with you?
Didn't paulie tell you
i ain't been feelin' good?

32:05.440 --> 32:07.942
I wipe my ass
with your feelings.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

32:08.443 --> 32:10.945
Drive the fuckin' car!

32:18.953 --> 32:22.457
We're under a microscope,
and i gotta hear you shot some
fuckin' civilian in the foot...

32:22.457 --> 32:24.959
'cause he made you wait
for buns?
Fuckin' paulie.

32:24.959 --> 32:27.962
Don't blame paulie!
Makazian comes to me
and says nutley p. D. S...

32:27.962 --> 32:29.964
got a description
and a make on the car!

32:30.465 --> 32:32.967
Why don't you just leave a
fuckin' urine sample next time?
If i could've done it--

32:33.468 --> 32:36.971
oh, shut up! Fuckin' georgie
comes into the club, he's got
vomit all over his shirt.

32:36.971 --> 32:40.475
I ask him,"what the fuck?" he
said you're diggin' up some body
you clipped three months ago!

32:40.975 --> 32:42.477
I was worried--
shut up!

32:42.977 --> 32:45.480
People do that shit,
they wanna get caught.
I wanna get caught?

32:45.480 --> 32:48.483
You wanna get caught.
I seen it before,
this fuckin' "cowboy- itis"!

32:48.483 --> 32:51.486
You wanna be a big,
bad guy, christopher?
I was worried that i didn't--

32:51.486 --> 32:53.488
shut up!

32:58.743 --> 33:02.246
Can i try and explain here?

33:04.499 --> 33:07.502
I don't know, tony.

33:07.502 --> 33:11.506
It's like just the fuckin'
"regularness" of life is
too fuckin' hard for me.

33:11.506 --> 33:13.508
I don't--
i don't know.

33:19.013 --> 33:22.016
Look at you.

33:22.016 --> 33:25.019
I bet you're sleepin'
all the time, right?

33:25.019 --> 33:27.889
It's the only thing
i still enjoy.

33:29.390 --> 33:31.392
You know what i think?

33:31.893 --> 33:35.396
Maybe i have cancer.

33:35.897 --> 33:37.899
You remember
how jackie got?

33:38.032 --> 33:39.534
Cancer?

33:39.901 --> 33:43.905
Somethin' fuckin' horrible's
goin' on inside my body.
There's a physical change.

33:44.038 --> 33:47.542
Does this word "cancer"
pop into your mind a lot,

33:47.542 --> 33:49.544
a little bit, what?

33:50.044 --> 33:55.550
- Huh?
- Well, i'm just thinkin'
maybe you're...

33:55.550 --> 33:57.552
depressed.
Me?

33:57.668 --> 34:00.671
I'm no fuckin'
mental midget.

34:05.309 --> 34:07.311
All right.

34:09.179 --> 34:11.431
- Watch the, the--
- what?

34:11.933 --> 34:13.935
The filter.
Oh, fuck!

34:24.946 --> 34:28.449
Maybe you got a, uh,
serotonin problem,

34:28.949 --> 34:32.453
or whatever the fuck
they call it, ya know.

34:32.453 --> 34:34.839
You know about that shit?

34:35.840 --> 34:38.842
I saw it last night
on a...program.

34:38.842 --> 34:42.847
What, take fuckin' prozac?
Not this skinny guinea.

34:45.850 --> 34:48.351
Let me ask you a question.

34:49.719 --> 34:54.225
You ever think about,
uh, you know--

34:56.726 --> 34:58.729
fuck no!

35:00.231 --> 35:02.233
Good.

35:03.734 --> 35:08.239
Can you imagine those
fuckin' losers blowin' their
skulls all over the bathroom?

35:08.739 --> 35:10.741
It's fuckin' pathetic.

35:32.513 --> 35:36.017
Hey, didn't you hear
the goddamn doorbell?
I'm in the middle of a game.

35:36.017 --> 35:39.520
You'll be in the middle
of the fuckin' street
you don't wise up.

35:50.781 --> 35:52.783
Anthony soprano?

35:52.917 --> 35:54.919
What are you doing
in my backyard?

35:55.036 --> 35:57.038
The gate was open.
I'm agent harris.

35:57.538 --> 36:01.042
This is agent driscol.
May we come in?
If i say no?

36:01.292 --> 36:04.295
If we were local,
we wouldn't even have knocked.

36:04.428 --> 36:06.931
What's your point?

36:07.048 --> 36:10.051
We have a search warrant.
We know you have children
in the house.

36:10.434 --> 36:12.937
Other team's waiting out front.
We don't think it necessary...

36:12.937 --> 36:15.056
to traumatize kids
by kicking in doors.

36:15.556 --> 36:19.060
So, why don't you take
a minute and tell them
you have, uh, visitors.

36:34.075 --> 36:36.077
Hmm.

36:43.467 --> 36:45.469
Any quarters,
you can keep.

36:45.469 --> 36:48.472
You tryin' to bribe me?

36:48.472 --> 36:51.475
Why don't you tell me
what you're lookin' for?
Maybe i can save you some time.

36:51.475 --> 36:54.478
- Any incriminating evidence
would be nice.
-

36:56.347 --> 36:58.349
dad!

36:58.733 --> 37:01.736
They're taking my computer.
I have an english paper.
You gotta be shittin' me.

37:01.852 --> 37:04.739
I better have all
my programs on there
when it comes back.

37:05.239 --> 37:07.241
Anthony.

37:07.241 --> 37:11.245
What the hell are they doin'
in my kitchen?

37:13.748 --> 37:16.367
What the hell are you doin'
in my refrigerator?

37:16.367 --> 37:19.870
- If you forgot your lunch box,
pal, why don't you just ask?
- I'm very sorry.

37:19.870 --> 37:23.374
Mrs. Soprano, how much
would you say that bowl cost?
I'm not cleaning that up.

37:23.874 --> 37:25.876
Grasso, get somethin'
to clean that.

37:25.876 --> 37:28.379
Grasso--

37:28.879 --> 37:31.632
- your ass!
- Hey, hey, hey! Tony.

37:31.632 --> 37:33.634
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Grasso, take it easy.

37:34.018 --> 37:36.520
Tony, we're gonna be out
of here in a few minutes.

37:36.520 --> 37:40.524
Tony, let's wait
in the living room.
Clean up the bowl.

37:40.524 --> 37:42.526
Come on.

37:50.785 --> 37:53.287
I know those feds are doin'
their job, but it pisses me off
the way they act.

37:53.287 --> 37:55.790
That one guy wasn't
so bad, harris.

37:55.790 --> 37:59.794
Trust me, he was the biggest
sneak out of all of'em.
It's all part of his little act.

37:59.794 --> 38:02.296
And that guy
that broke the bowl,
he did that on purpose.

38:02.296 --> 38:04.799
I don't think so.
He was just a klutz.

38:04.799 --> 38:09.670
What was his last name?
Rizzo, razzo, what?
Grasso.

38:09.670 --> 38:12.673
Grasso. Do you think
it's a coincidence
they sent him?

38:12.673 --> 38:16.177
If he wasn't an italian,
he'd be back at the office
sweepin' up. The stupid jerk.

38:16.677 --> 38:18.679
They probably frisk him
every night before he goes home.

38:18.679 --> 38:22.066
- Why?
- Why? 'cause he has a vowel
at the end of his name.

38:22.566 --> 38:27.071
Grasso. What's he think,
he's gonna make it to the top
by arresting his own people?

38:27.071 --> 38:29.690
Pass the mushu.
He'll see.

38:29.690 --> 38:31.442
- He'll learn.
- We have a vowel.

38:31.942 --> 38:33.444
"F"- in' right,
and you be proud of it.

38:33.944 --> 38:37.948
Jesus christ, you'd think
there never was a michelangelo
the way they treat people.

38:38.082 --> 38:40.701
Did you know that an italian
invented the telephone?

38:40.701 --> 38:44.088
- Alexander graham bell
was italian?
- You see?

38:44.088 --> 38:47.958
You see what i'm talkin'--
antonio meucci invented the
telephone and he got robbed!

38:48.459 --> 38:50.961
Everybody knows that.

38:50.961 --> 38:53.464
Who invented the mafia?

38:53.464 --> 38:57.218
What?
La cosa nostra,
who invented that?

38:57.218 --> 38:59.603
- Who cares?
- Wasn't it salvatore lucana,

39:00.104 --> 39:04.475
better known as
charlie "lucky" luciano who
organized the five families?

39:04.608 --> 39:07.611
Lucchese, gambino,
bonnano, profaci.

39:07.862 --> 39:10.364
Is there somethin'
you wanna say to me?

39:11.615 --> 39:14.118
I just like history,
like you, dad.

39:14.235 --> 39:16.987
- Can you just shut
the fuck up about it?
- Hey!

39:17.121 --> 39:19.623
Hey!

39:21.125 --> 39:24.745
A. J. , did you know that
john cabot was italian?
Whoa.

39:24.745 --> 39:28.249
- Like he knows who that is.
- It's the famous discoverer
of canada.

39:28.632 --> 39:31.135
The bank of america.
You ever heard of it?

39:31.135 --> 39:34.138
One of the biggest banks
in the world,
started by an italian.

39:34.505 --> 39:36.507
The first american saint
was italian-- mother cabrini.

39:37.007 --> 39:39.009
That's right.

39:39.009 --> 39:42.012
Is it true that the chinese
invented spaghetti?

39:42.012 --> 39:45.516
Now think about it.
Why would people
who eat with sticks...

39:45.516 --> 39:49.019
invent something that
you need a fork to eat?

39:49.019 --> 39:51.522
And here's something else
i bet you didn't know.

39:51.522 --> 39:55.409
More italians fought for
this country in world war ii
than any other ethnic group.

39:57.161 --> 39:59.163
And they won't tell you about
sacco and vanzetti either.

39:59.530 --> 40:02.032
The two antichrists
that got the electric chair
in massachusetts?

40:02.283 --> 40:05.035
- Anarchists.
- Isn't it antichrists?

40:05.286 --> 40:08.289
They were two innocent men
who got the chair
because they were italian.

40:08.789 --> 40:11.292
How can there be
two antichrists?
There was only one christ.

40:11.675 --> 40:14.795
- So?
- And of course,

40:15.296 --> 40:17.298
francis albert.

40:19.934 --> 40:23.437
Will i see you next week?
Unless you know somethin'
i don't.

40:23.437 --> 40:26.941
Just so you understand,
that i have to charge you
for the missed session.

40:27.308 --> 40:29.810
What are you talkin' about?

40:29.944 --> 40:31.946
We agreed on that
on our very first meeting.

40:32.446 --> 40:34.448
I know, but i just explained
to you my situation.

40:34.815 --> 40:38.319
I understand,
but it's important that
we respect the agreement.

40:40.704 --> 40:43.073
- What if i got hit by a car?
- But you weren't.

40:43.574 --> 40:46.577
- I know, but what if?
- But you weren't.

40:46.827 --> 40:49.713
- I know that, but, but what if?
- You weren't.

40:49.830 --> 40:53.334
- Why don't you answer
my fuckin' question?
- I will not.

40:53.834 --> 40:55.836
You won't?

40:56.337 --> 40:58.339
All right, fine, fine.

40:58.839 --> 41:01.342
Here. Here you go.

41:01.342 --> 41:04.228
Of course, 'cause this is what
it's all about? Motherfuckin',
cocksuckin' money!

41:04.728 --> 41:06.730
Here.

41:08.232 --> 41:12.736
I don't understand that comment,
and i don't appreciate
being made to feel afraid.

41:12.987 --> 41:16.490
I don't appreciate feelin' like
i pour my heart out
to a fuckin' call girl.

41:16.740 --> 41:19.610
- Is that how you see me?
- Not until now.

41:19.610 --> 41:23.614
But it's obvious you don't
give a shit about my situation
or what's happenin' with me!

41:23.614 --> 41:26.617
Otherwise, you wouldn't
be shakin' me down.

41:29.119 --> 41:31.622
It'll show as "paid"
on your next month's bill.

41:32.122 --> 41:35.125
Fine.
Stick it up your ass.

41:44.735 --> 41:47.054
And how about dr. Goldman
over here?

41:47.054 --> 41:51.058
Originally, he was gonna be
a tree surgeon, but he fainted
at the sight of sap.

41:51.058 --> 41:54.061
Sap, ladies and gentlemen.

41:54.562 --> 41:58.065
Pace yourselves.
Don't spend it all
in one place.

41:58.065 --> 42:02.570
Movie night, right?
Last week they showed
the polish version ofrashomon.

42:02.570 --> 42:07.074
Everybody remembers
the rape exactly the same.
The'60s--

42:07.074 --> 42:09.577
what's the matter
with you, corrado?

42:09.577 --> 42:13.581
Headaches, that's all.
Not the kind you take
aspirin for.

42:14.081 --> 42:17.084
Now, tonight on our show,
we have mitzi gaynor,

42:17.084 --> 42:19.587
sergio franchi
and a woman from france...

42:19.587 --> 42:22.590
who will pull
a string of lightbulbs
out of her husband's throat.

42:22.590 --> 42:24.592
This woman can relate.

42:24.842 --> 42:29.847
I think we may have
a bad apple.
Does tony know about this?

42:30.347 --> 42:34.852
What are you gonna do?
There's not much to do.
We have to sit back and wait.

42:34.852 --> 42:38.856
And do me a favor,
don't let tony know you know.
He's under enough pressure.

42:41.358 --> 42:45.362
I'm sure he's tellin'
his psychiatrist
it's all his mother's fault.

42:45.613 --> 42:50.751
- What are you talkin'
about, a psychiatrist?
- Yeah, a psychiatrist.

42:50.751 --> 42:53.754
He's been seein' one
for a while now.

42:53.871 --> 42:57.625
God only knows what he says.

42:57.758 --> 43:00.761
- Tony?
- Yes, tony.

43:00.761 --> 43:04.265
Tony, who had
such a terrible mother.

43:04.265 --> 43:09.019
- A psychiatrist?
- Yes, junior.
For christ's sake!

43:09.520 --> 43:14.024
Show of hands.
How many people think j. F. K.
Is still alive? Come on.

43:14.024 --> 43:16.527
They should take
a zapruder film
of your salad bar?

43:16.527 --> 43:19.029
Hello? Help me out.

43:19.280 --> 43:21.782
Who?
The psychiatrist, i mean.

43:21.782 --> 43:23.784
Do you think i know?

43:24.285 --> 43:27.288
What did you say
to tony about this?
Me?

43:27.288 --> 43:31.792
Nothin'. I wouldn't give him
the satisfaction.

43:31.792 --> 43:36.914
And, junior, i don't want
there to be any repercussions.

43:38.415 --> 43:40.417
A psychiatrist?

43:40.801 --> 43:43.804
You're a broken record.

43:43.804 --> 43:45.806
Yes, yes.

43:45.806 --> 43:47.808
Shh.
Do i have to--

43:48.309 --> 43:52.313
this lady is blind. Dear,
i have a few words for you.

43:52.313 --> 43:55.816
Do i have to say it again?
They are lucy in the sky
with diamonds.

43:55.816 --> 43:58.936
All right?
Picture yourself in a boat
at ellis island.

43:58.936 --> 44:01.438
All right,
how does that sound?

44:05.442 --> 44:07.945
It's me. Leave a message.

44:07.945 --> 44:10.447
Christopher? It's mommy.

44:10.948 --> 44:12.950
I know you're there.
Pick it up.

44:13.450 --> 44:16.954
Are you all right?
I'm worried about you.

44:16.954 --> 44:19.957
My god, they mentioned your name
in the newspaper today.

44:19.957 --> 44:23.460
Thestar- ledger.
Mrs. Jones told me.

44:23.460 --> 44:25.963
With all those scumbags.

44:25.963 --> 44:29.967
It's been a while
since we met for therapy.

44:29.967 --> 44:31.969
Mm- hmm.

44:31.969 --> 44:34.972
Jason, how's bard?

44:37.474 --> 44:40.477
I'm moving into
a smoke- free dorm.

44:43.981 --> 44:45.983
And how do we feel
about that?

44:46.233 --> 44:48.736
I'm more interested
in discussing what
we mentioned before.

44:49.119 --> 44:53.123
Jason, are you concerned
that your mother is treating
this patient x?

44:54.241 --> 44:56.744
I don't care.

44:57.244 --> 45:02.249
As a colleague, jen,
i suggest you drop the patient.

45:02.383 --> 45:05.753
After her
last encounter with him,
she finally acknowledged...

45:05.753 --> 45:09.256
that she saw the different side
of him-- the subhuman.

45:09.506 --> 45:11.759
I take it you were frightened.

45:11.759 --> 45:14.261
Frightened, revolted.

45:14.645 --> 45:16.146
At long last,
appropriate emotions.

45:16.647 --> 45:19.149
Oh, for christ's sake, richard.
You too, sam.

45:19.400 --> 45:24.021
- When did we become so afraid
to get our hands dirty?
- It's what she gets paid for.

45:24.021 --> 45:27.024
Jason, how would you like
to see your mother--

45:29.026 --> 45:33.030
never mind.
I'm not gonna paint
any graphic images.

45:33.414 --> 45:35.916
See?
He always does that.

45:36.417 --> 45:40.421
- What?
- Follow that up, jas.
Dad does what?

45:40.921 --> 45:43.924
His real issue is that
i should distance myself
from this man...

45:43.924 --> 45:46.927
on the grounds of the stigma
that he brings us.

45:47.044 --> 45:50.547
I say, refer this patient
to a therapist...

45:51.048 --> 45:54.551
that specializes
