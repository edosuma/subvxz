00:02.360 --> 00:05.239
Anyone watching thinking
we know fuck all

00:05.240 --> 00:09.239
about knowing fuck all about owt
needs to watch their back.

00:09.400 --> 00:12.119
So you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk,

00:12.184 --> 00:14.343
sending prices sky-high,

00:14.365 --> 00:18.364
literally, literally
taking the grass from its own roots!

00:18.925 --> 00:21.084
And now you've got
your ConDemNation.

00:21.085 --> 00:24.844
Liberals noshing Tories
like altar boys picking dimps up.

00:24.845 --> 00:28.324
Have we had a national
fucking stroke or what?

00:28.325 --> 00:31.404
Is revolution a word
or was it never?

00:31.405 --> 00:33.924
Anybody watching needs to know

00:33.925 --> 00:37.924
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:38.165 --> 00:42.124
Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester

00:42.125 --> 00:44.364
and they charge us for water!

00:44.365 --> 00:48.364
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found,

00:49.045 --> 00:52.284
this green and pleasant
land in ancient times,

00:52.285 --> 00:55.364
yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak!

00:55.365 --> 00:57.484
It's nottheirsany more.

00:57.485 --> 01:01.124
This is our England now!

01:01.125 --> 01:03.524
Paaarty!

'Age-old question,
answered by many a martyr.

01:15.216 --> 01:18.375
'Who is the ultimate authority?

01:18.376 --> 01:21.215
'How many politicians do you trust?

Bang to rights!

Oh, Mother Mary!

I used to place my trust.

01:44.745 --> 01:46.784
Those poor babies.

01:46.785 --> 01:50.144
Civil war will claim another
hundred thousand,

01:50.145 --> 01:52.344
and they're not letting aid through.

01:52.345 --> 01:54.584
Going to be worse than
Live Aid, this one.

01:56.585 --> 01:59.264
Nothing plumbs the depths
like Status Quo.

01:59.265 --> 02:02.899
A good famine is the life support
of the British music industry.

02:02.915 --> 02:04.674
We'll have a chat on pay day.

02:05.805 --> 02:07.524
Begs the question, though.

02:07.539 --> 02:10.058
Famine and pestilence
don't prove there's no God.

02:10.097 --> 02:12.136
Try telling that to
the little pot-bellies.

02:12.137 --> 02:15.056
If he's up there,
how's it not a fucking disgrace?

02:15.057 --> 02:16.416
Better off not being born.

02:16.417 --> 02:20.416
For every claim that God
wouldn't let this happen,
I can provide ten arguments

02:20.537 --> 02:23.256
invoking man's culpability and
abuse of the gift of free will.

02:23.500 --> 02:24.579
Ah! Free Willy!

02:24.580 --> 02:27.459
Every Catholic's
get-out-of-jail card.

02:27.460 --> 02:30.019
What free will have they got?

02:30.020 --> 02:31.939
Where's God? Right now?

02:31.940 --> 02:34.939
Living like that?
Worse than no life at all!

02:37.220 --> 02:38.459
Divine intervention?!

02:38.460 --> 02:42.419
St Peter's press office
sending the latest spin? >

02:42.420 --> 02:44.259
Natural selection,
that's all it is

02:44.260 --> 02:46.179
Selfish genes.

02:46.180 --> 02:50.179
"We will procreate!
"We will procreate!"

02:50.340 --> 02:53.539
Yeah, knock a few million
out of the food chain.

02:54.580 --> 02:56.739
Take care of the rest of us
lucky fuckers

02:56.740 --> 02:59.099
by giving us
the winning lottery tickets.

02:59.100 --> 03:03.099
'Course, you lot change
the rules to suit...

03:03.420 --> 03:06.779
There's no use genuflecting

03:06.780 --> 03:08.819
You just incorporate
intelligent design...

03:08.836 --> 03:09.555
Come on.

03:09.556 --> 03:11.275
Into God's master plan...

03:11.276 --> 03:14.115
'Hiya, this is Alice.
You know what to do, don't you?'

03:14.116 --> 03:15.515
you live where the sand is,

03:15.516 --> 03:17.595
move where the food is.

03:17.596 --> 03:19.915
You'll be fucking guilty
when you get to heaven

03:19.916 --> 03:22.875
and there's nothing there and all
the money you put in the pot,

03:22.876 --> 03:24.835
money that goes towards

03:24.836 --> 03:26.835
the Pope having hand-crafted shoes

03:26.836 --> 03:30.235
made from the genitals
of Italian street boys.

03:30.236 --> 03:34.235
Fuck that!

03:38.316 --> 03:42.155
Thursday, your honour!

03:42.156 --> 03:43.635
Your honour?

03:43.636 --> 03:46.515
Corridors of power, Kelly.
Turns me on.

03:46.516 --> 03:48.755
He's only a magistrate!

03:48.756 --> 03:50.035
So what?

03:50.036 --> 03:54.035
Anyone can be one.

03:54.196 --> 03:56.595
You can't.

03:56.596 --> 04:00.595
Going out!

04:04.356 --> 04:06.795
That's not dressing
for Mortal Combat at Macka's!

04:06.796 --> 04:08.035
Something else came up.

04:08.036 --> 04:09.795
Are you two-timing me?!

04:09.796 --> 04:11.995
Look at you.

04:11.996 --> 04:13.715
It must be love!

04:13.716 --> 04:17.714
Behave! It's only the second time
we've gone out.

04:19.116 --> 04:22.435
Open's fine.

04:22.436 --> 04:26.435
Hey, no chatting to schoolies,
Teesh!

04:26.676 --> 04:29.155
Don't break her heart!

04:29.156 --> 04:33.155
Come, then.

04:37.196 --> 04:39.435
Did you have your chat?

04:47.356 --> 04:49.315
Can't we do it together?

04:49.316 --> 04:51.355
No, because that's
even more embarrassing.

04:51.356 --> 04:52.875
They know more about sex than we
ever will.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.235
Watching porn on an iPhone

04:54.236 --> 04:56.755
isn't going to help
her emotional development.

04:56.756 --> 04:59.555
Were you worried about
emotional development

04:59.556 --> 05:01.995
when we lay on your tracky top
in Sharston woods?

05:01.996 --> 05:03.395
You better do it.

05:03.396 --> 05:04.995
She listens to you.

05:04.996 --> 05:07.435
No, I said tails.

05:07.436 --> 05:10.955
I always have tails.

05:10.956 --> 05:13.355
Avril!

05:16.756 --> 05:17.715
Avril!

05:17.716 --> 05:21.355
I hear you!

05:21.356 --> 05:22.995
Jesus!

05:22.996 --> 05:24.555
Alice!

05:24.556 --> 05:28.555

05:48.116 --> 05:52.115
Alice, come on!

05:57.076 --> 05:58.755
Alice!

05:58.756 --> 06:02.035
Alice!

06:02.036 --> 06:05.875
Fuck, no!

06:05.876 --> 06:08.715
Alice! Alice!

06:08.716 --> 06:11.115
Fuck!

06:14.716 --> 06:16.195
Hey, what's wrong?

06:16.196 --> 06:17.755
Where've you been?

06:17.756 --> 06:19.635
Where do you think?

06:19.636 --> 06:21.875
Teesh!

06:21.876 --> 06:23.475
What's he done?

06:23.476 --> 06:25.715
Nothing yet. Really.

06:25.716 --> 06:27.315
So what's wrong, then?

06:27.316 --> 06:29.155
Maybe I'd like more than two words

06:29.156 --> 06:30.995
before he tries to take my top off!

06:30.996 --> 06:32.155
It's Warren!

06:32.156 --> 06:35.035
Do you know how many girls would
love to be in your shoes right now?

06:35.036 --> 06:36.875
Thought we were eating?
We will.

06:36.876 --> 06:40.795
Just come back inside
and have another drink.

06:40.796 --> 06:42.075
Maybe another time.

06:42.076 --> 06:46.075
You don't have to come.

07:22.396 --> 07:23.755
I'm really sorry.

07:23.756 --> 07:27.755
You should just
get some sleep now.

07:33.756 --> 07:36.835
I impregnated a 16-year-old.

07:36.836 --> 07:40.835
But she lost the baby.

07:42.436 --> 07:44.035
See you later. All right?

07:44.036 --> 07:48.035
OK.

07:51.476 --> 07:55.475
See you later.

07:57.236 --> 08:01.235
And they wonder why
church attendance is down.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.515
I'm sorry for texting.

08:10.516 --> 08:13.755
Oh, no, don't be.

08:13.756 --> 08:17.115
I'm glad you did.

08:17.116 --> 08:19.035
I'm glad you got to me.

08:19.036 --> 08:21.275
Maybe you do care.

08:21.276 --> 08:24.035
Of course I do. Always.

08:24.036 --> 08:28.035
There's still a chance for us, then?

08:29.996 --> 08:31.555
I'm teasing!

08:31.556 --> 08:34.475
Yeah, I know you were.

08:34.476 --> 08:35.995
As ever...

08:35.996 --> 08:39.995
So does being saved mean
I've still got a hope of heaven?

08:41.916 --> 08:45.915
I know there's a space
with your name on.

08:47.636 --> 08:49.515
On authority from above.

08:49.516 --> 08:50.595
Of course.

08:50.596 --> 08:53.355
You've got direct contact.

08:53.356 --> 08:56.715
This one was a visitation
in a dream.

08:56.716 --> 08:57.995
Clear as day.

08:57.996 --> 09:00.075
Said the plot's definitely yours.

09:00.076 --> 09:04.075
But it won't be ready until
you're the grand old age of 95.

09:06.116 --> 09:10.115
So promise me
you'll hang around till then?

09:10.676 --> 09:14.675
Anything for you.

09:16.236 --> 09:19.595
I think we would have had
a little girl.

09:19.596 --> 09:21.035
You will do one day.

09:21.036 --> 09:24.715
She'd be walking, talking...

09:24.716 --> 09:28.555
Alice, come on.

09:28.556 --> 09:32.555
You're going to be OK.

09:42.956 --> 09:44.595
He says condoms always split on him.

09:44.596 --> 09:46.795
Eurgh! That bony arse?!

09:46.796 --> 09:50.795
You better believe it.
Tony Baloney pressed all my buttons.

09:51.116 --> 09:52.195
Aren't you worried?

09:52.196 --> 09:54.435
No, I was at the chemist
before it even opened.

09:54.436 --> 09:55.835
Where his sister works?

09:55.836 --> 09:57.355
Oh, I know. I forgot.

09:57.356 --> 09:59.115
She made me feel like a right tramp.

09:59.116 --> 10:01.075
She can talk.
Exactly!

10:01.076 --> 10:03.355
What about catching something?

10:03.356 --> 10:04.955
I made him cover up.
What more can I do?

10:04.956 --> 10:08.395
Not sleep with him
on the first date?

10:08.396 --> 10:11.235
People are starting to wonder
what you're into.

10:11.236 --> 10:14.195
Whether boys are really
your thing.

10:14.196 --> 10:17.795
Think I care what people think?

10:17.796 --> 10:19.115
Well, I've gotta go.

10:19.116 --> 10:21.955
But I'm just saying,
it's the 21st century.

10:21.956 --> 10:23.355
Forget prim and proper.

10:23.356 --> 10:27.075
Tony told me
to bring Keisha for Warren.

10:27.076 --> 10:31.075
You're getting left behind, girl.

10:38.516 --> 10:40.915
Should have seen
the cuts on her arms.

10:40.916 --> 10:42.675
Bet she weighs next to nothing.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.795
So? Who knows what kind of shit

10:44.796 --> 10:48.475
she's dealing with at home.

10:48.476 --> 10:50.755
Which started with me
getting her pregnant.

10:50.756 --> 10:52.915
It took two to tango.

10:52.916 --> 10:54.635
She played you!

10:54.636 --> 10:56.275
I saw the gear she used to wear.

10:56.276 --> 10:58.875
Remember what I used to wear?

10:58.876 --> 11:02.875
Sending her money every month
is more than anyone else would do.

11:04.636 --> 11:05.835
Yeah...

11:05.836 --> 11:09.835
You saved her. Now put it to bed.

11:09.996 --> 11:11.115
Please!

11:11.116 --> 11:12.555
Jamie!

11:12.556 --> 11:15.875
Oi, mate!
No fighting on these premises, eh?

11:15.876 --> 11:18.235
I was going to visit later.

11:18.236 --> 11:19.875
There's no point!

11:19.876 --> 11:22.435
She sneaked out last night.

11:22.436 --> 11:26.235
Jumped from the top
of the hospital car park.

11:26.236 --> 11:28.275
No!

11:28.276 --> 11:31.008
She's all we had!

12:04.776 --> 12:06.295
Thank you very much, thank you.

12:06.296 --> 12:07.375
Thank you so much.

12:07.376 --> 12:09.355
Thank you.

12:09.447 --> 12:10.886
Settling in, Father? Yeah.

12:10.887 --> 12:13.286
Makes it easy when everyone
makes you feel so welcome.

12:13.287 --> 12:14.766
Thank you, thanks for coming.

12:14.767 --> 12:16.246
Beautiful service, thank you.

12:16.723 --> 12:17.802
Good morning, Father.

12:17.803 --> 12:21.802
Morning.

12:45.203 --> 12:48.322
The other kids are laughing at her.
Saying things...

12:48.323 --> 12:50.802
Forget age! What about
when it happens naturally?

12:50.803 --> 12:52.162
Right person, right time?

12:52.163 --> 12:54.522
I just think there's
a way of helping her out.

12:54.523 --> 12:56.242
Making sure it's not
a disappointment.

12:56.243 --> 12:57.762
I'm three months younger than you.

12:57.763 --> 13:00.242
What was so wrong
with your first time?

13:00.243 --> 13:02.242
It was perfect, Mr Loverman.

13:02.243 --> 13:05.442
Oi. Cloggsy's clouted
a transit full of laptops.

13:05.443 --> 13:06.522
Our name's on fifty.

13:06.523 --> 13:09.002
Over to the divine sisterhood.

13:09.003 --> 13:10.522
A higher authority...

13:10.523 --> 13:13.882
Laters.

13:13.883 --> 13:17.882
My real first time was a spotty
scrote behind the bins after netball.

13:18.323 --> 13:20.202
Horrible.

13:20.203 --> 13:21.722
So Jackson thinks he's your...

13:21.723 --> 13:25.722
Mmm-hmm.

13:25.843 --> 13:29.002
My first was 25, and I was 15.

13:29.003 --> 13:30.402
And?

13:30.403 --> 13:32.162
He certainly knew a thing or two.

13:32.163 --> 13:35.242
There you go. If it gives Letitia
a better experience,

13:35.243 --> 13:37.682
what's so wrong with that?

13:37.683 --> 13:39.962
Well, I always thought
she'd get it on with Aidan.

13:39.963 --> 13:41.002
No.

13:41.003 --> 13:44.002
Can I have a beer
and an alcopop, please?

13:44.003 --> 13:45.282
Have you nailed her yet?

13:45.283 --> 13:46.362
Like I'd tell you.

13:46.363 --> 13:47.562
Queer.

13:47.563 --> 13:51.562
That's a definite 'no', bro!

13:51.683 --> 13:55.682
Aargh, what you doing?!

14:19.803 --> 14:21.202
Bang to rights.

14:25.603 --> 14:27.202
Oh, hello!

14:27.203 --> 14:31.202
Yes, m'dear.

14:41.163 --> 14:44.002
My first time was
with someone older.

14:44.003 --> 14:46.842
There's a lot to be
said for experience.

14:46.843 --> 14:48.602
What's with the tag-team?

14:48.603 --> 14:50.442
What are you two getting at?

14:50.443 --> 14:51.962
Nothing.

14:51.963 --> 14:55.962
But maybe Warren's
worth a second chance?

14:56.523 --> 14:58.762
He sells weed and he grunts.

14:58.763 --> 15:00.882
You're supposed to want
the best for me.

15:00.883 --> 15:02.962
It'll be easier
when you go to college.

15:02.963 --> 15:04.122
What will?

15:04.123 --> 15:05.722
To date an older guy.

15:05.723 --> 15:07.082
Maybe one of your lecturers.

15:07.083 --> 15:08.242
Mum!

15:08.243 --> 15:12.242
Once it's over with, there's no
awkward boundaries. No taboos.

15:14.403 --> 15:18.402
Are you OK?

15:18.523 --> 15:20.002
Course.

15:20.003 --> 15:24.002
Don't worry, yeah?

15:28.003 --> 15:29.922
The genie is
out of the bottle, mate.

15:29.923 --> 15:32.882
Kids' heads get battered with sex

15:32.883 --> 15:35.842
and shagging soon after they've
stopped watching Iggle Piggle.

15:35.843 --> 15:38.242
You've done well
she's lasted this long.

15:38.243 --> 15:40.002
You ever bump into
the first girl you slept with?

15:40.003 --> 15:42.842
Erm... funerals, weddings.

15:42.843 --> 15:44.402
Was a second cousin.

15:44.403 --> 15:47.802
Shagged it behind a pile of turf
at my nana's in Kildare.

15:47.803 --> 15:48.842
You?

15:48.843 --> 15:49.482
All the time.

15:49.483 --> 15:50.682
Where?

15:50.683 --> 15:52.602
Two streets over there.

15:52.603 --> 15:54.362
No way!

15:54.363 --> 15:55.882
Avril was your first?

15:55.883 --> 15:58.682
On my Tacchini tracky. Turned it
inside out to keep it clean.

15:58.683 --> 16:00.962
You've done plenty of
splitting up though, yeah?

16:00.963 --> 16:02.722
Played away once.

16:02.723 --> 16:05.042
You've had...

16:05.043 --> 16:06.802
two women?

16:06.803 --> 16:08.722
Ever.

16:08.723 --> 16:11.682
What, you think there's
something wrong with that?

16:11.683 --> 16:15.682
No, it's, er... very noble.

16:18.723 --> 16:22.042
The last one I got off Coggsy
was riddled with that many viruses

16:22.043 --> 16:24.242
I thought I was going to
catch something.

16:24.243 --> 16:25.322
Well they're sweet, them.

16:25.323 --> 16:29.162
Who's wearing the trousers today?

16:29.163 --> 16:33.042
Nice one.

16:35.483 --> 16:39.482
What?

16:40.123 --> 16:44.122
I didn't know magistrates could
claim blow jobs on expenses.

16:45.403 --> 16:47.242
We can't.

16:47.243 --> 16:49.602
I've told them you're my life coach.

16:49.603 --> 16:51.642
Which is just about claimable.

16:51.643 --> 16:53.642
Like in boxing?

16:53.643 --> 16:57.122
No... someone who helps
with strategies

16:57.123 --> 16:59.402
for long-term
psychological happiness.

16:59.403 --> 17:00.962
Jeremy Kyle?

17:00.963 --> 17:03.962
Nothing like Jeremy Kyle.

17:03.963 --> 17:07.962
They want to interview
you about this.

17:09.083 --> 17:11.842
I struggle with words.

17:11.843 --> 17:13.762
Do you know the reason I choose you?

17:13.762 --> 17:16.442
My specs?

17:16.443 --> 17:20.202
You're a sensitive soul,
a rare rose,

17:20.203 --> 17:23.482
a delicate speciality.

17:23.483 --> 17:27.482
I know... you can rise to this.

17:33.443 --> 17:36.962
Oh. Let me guess - texting
Manchester's biggest gangster?

17:36.963 --> 17:38.922
Not him. He's been sacked.

17:38.923 --> 17:41.802
Did you laugh at his shit car?

17:41.803 --> 17:44.682
Mum's treating me to new jeans.
We can get Nando's with the change?

17:44.683 --> 17:45.842
Yeah, defo.

17:45.843 --> 17:47.562
Trafford Centre's open till 10.

17:47.563 --> 17:51.202
I can't go tonight. I told Sarah
I'd go pictures with her.

17:51.203 --> 17:54.922
No worries. Maybe some other time.

17:54.923 --> 17:58.922
I was thinking nice and tight.

18:31.203 --> 18:34.042
Hey.

18:34.043 --> 18:35.882
Insomnia must be contagious.

18:35.883 --> 18:39.882
Yeah. Go on, go back to bed.

18:41.683 --> 18:45.482
Dom, what's that about?

18:45.483 --> 18:48.522
Sanctioned self-harming.

18:48.523 --> 18:51.722
The church was on to
that buzz centuries ago.

18:51.723 --> 18:55.722
It's not funny.

18:55.723 --> 18:59.242
Trying to get to where her head was.

18:59.243 --> 19:01.562
To what end?

19:01.563 --> 19:03.242
See what pushed her.

19:03.243 --> 19:07.242
I thought you said she jumped.

19:07.323 --> 19:10.122
Look.

19:10.123 --> 19:14.122
I was mad into him back then.

19:14.363 --> 19:18.122
And now?

19:18.123 --> 19:22.122
We're having a slight
difference of opinion.

19:23.483 --> 19:27.042
In the name of the father...

19:27.043 --> 19:29.482
I order you to bed.

19:29.483 --> 19:33.482
Go on. I'm all right.

19:55.243 --> 19:58.882
Eloi, eloi, lama sabachthani.

19:58.883 --> 20:02.882
Eh?

20:02.883 --> 20:06.882
You don't mind, do you?

20:12.883 --> 20:16.882
You fucked with me
from the very start.

20:17.003 --> 20:18.762
No dad, no role model...

20:18.763 --> 20:22.762
is that how you suck us in, do you?
The vulnerable? The needy?

20:23.803 --> 20:27.802
Like some parasite nonce?

20:36.523 --> 20:39.242
All those years I covered for you,

20:39.243 --> 20:43.082
lying on your behalf...

20:43.083 --> 20:45.522
How often did I dupe
young men and women

20:45.523 --> 20:48.522
struck down in their prime
by incurable cancers?

20:48.523 --> 20:51.882
Reassured them -
pray to you, believe...

20:51.883 --> 20:55.882
their journey has a destination?

21:00.283 --> 21:02.682
I was never selfish.

21:02.683 --> 21:04.482
Not once.

21:04.483 --> 21:07.042
Cos that's how
it's supposed to work.

21:07.043 --> 21:08.682
You give when needed

21:08.683 --> 21:12.682
and I trusted that
you would do the right thing.

21:15.003 --> 21:19.002
Hadn't she suffered enough?

21:19.763 --> 21:23.762
Hadn't she suffered enough?!

21:31.203 --> 21:35.202
Can't you see
I'm done with you now?

21:46.083 --> 21:50.082
You're nothing to me.

21:50.363 --> 21:51.645
We're done.

22:05.505 --> 22:07.904
"Surround yourself with...

22:07.904 --> 22:10.903
"..persons most like the
people you want to become."

22:10.904 --> 22:14.383
Nearly."..Peoplemost like
thepersonyou want to become."

22:14.384 --> 22:16.583
I told him I'd struggle.

22:16.584 --> 22:18.903
What do life coaches wear anyway?

22:18.904 --> 22:22.343
He told me, smart and casual.

22:22.344 --> 22:23.423
He's paying.

22:23.424 --> 22:27.423
No.

22:28.824 --> 22:30.583
Try another.

22:30.584 --> 22:32.863
"Don't put off being happy...

22:32.864 --> 22:34.943
"..until some later date."

22:35.280 --> 22:36.519
At last!

22:36.520 --> 22:40.519
A lot of this makes
sense, you know?

22:41.320 --> 22:45.319
He called me a delicate rose.

22:52.800 --> 22:56.799
I'll have a glass of your finest
red wine - and one for Frank.

22:58.920 --> 23:00.399
Potius hodie quam cras.

23:00.400 --> 23:01.919
Come again?

23:01.920 --> 23:05.079
School badge - red wine in
the morning, pisspots' warning.

23:05.080 --> 23:09.079
In the name of all wars,
genocide, starvation, floods,

23:10.080 --> 23:14.079
earthquakes, disease,
suicides and pointless slaughter...

23:14.760 --> 23:17.239
I salute you!

23:17.240 --> 23:18.679
Anyone else?

23:18.680 --> 23:21.439
Oh yeah. In nomine patri...

23:21.440 --> 23:24.839
Enough of this sacrilege!
Where's your respect?

23:24.840 --> 23:28.839
I am now a born again convert
to the word... of our Frank.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.919
You shall burn in hell.

23:30.920 --> 23:32.719
No, no, there is no hell...

23:32.720 --> 23:34.919
no god other than Eric of Cantona!

23:34.920 --> 23:36.319
Eh-hey-hey!

23:36.320 --> 23:39.039
Georgi Kinkladze is St Peter!

23:39.040 --> 23:43.039
Five tonne now - another
monkey when the job's done.

23:45.280 --> 23:48.639
Take four weeks of spitting
in burgers to earn a grand...

23:48.640 --> 23:52.639
Should be an easy decision, then?

23:55.000 --> 23:57.239
Go on.

23:57.240 --> 23:57.999
I need assistance.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.999
With?

24:02.040 --> 24:02.999
Who?

24:03.000 --> 24:04.159
Me.

24:04.160 --> 24:05.399
What?

24:05.400 --> 24:07.639
Suicide. You were right all along...

24:07.640 --> 24:09.839
Whoa...! Don't you blame this on me!

24:09.840 --> 24:12.999
Oh, there's no blame, but...
there's no god for me anymore.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.959
And like you said - living a certain
way is worse than no life at all.

24:16.960 --> 24:19.039
I was speaking about
little immigrants!

24:19.040 --> 24:22.399
Spend it on a flight to Zurich - get
a professional service!
Frank...

24:22.400 --> 24:25.839
At least have a think about it.

24:25.840 --> 24:29.839
Go on.

24:39.240 --> 24:41.359
So how long are they away for?
Just one night.

24:41.360 --> 24:43.839
She's on her own?
No brothers or sisters?

24:43.840 --> 24:45.679
They're with her mum and dad.

24:45.680 --> 24:46.439
Smashed it!

24:46.440 --> 24:48.799
Our man's going to
rattle it all night!

24:48.800 --> 24:50.479
She told me to come prepared...?

24:50.480 --> 24:54.239
Scrub up proper. After shave -
you can use my Aramis...

24:54.240 --> 24:55.839
wash your bellend...

24:55.840 --> 24:57.519
She means condoms!

24:57.520 --> 25:00.199
I'll sort it -
on the house.

25:00.200 --> 25:02.359
I want details, yeah?
Size of her nipples,

25:02.360 --> 25:05.639
if she's shaved her poonani
or if she's got spider's legs...!

25:05.640 --> 25:09.639
Yep - hear, see,
and speak plenty of evil.

25:13.800 --> 25:16.079
Hey, bro, did you see that, bro?

25:16.080 --> 25:20.079
She was checking you out!
My man's on fire!

25:27.840 --> 25:31.799
We used to hang
around here as kids.

25:31.800 --> 25:33.679
Lovely.

25:33.680 --> 25:37.679
Exploring round here was
like a journey to a lost world.

25:38.200 --> 25:40.439
Huh! I remember once,

25:40.440 --> 25:42.879
a proper sunburst came
through an 'ole in the roof

25:42.880 --> 25:46.879
and lit Jimmy H like an angel.

25:47.040 --> 25:50.239
I was up there, looking down.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.439
It was beautiful. I felt
warm, connected to it all.

25:52.440 --> 25:54.399
Glorious.

25:54.400 --> 25:58.399
Truly. Ten years old -
my first mystical experience.

25:58.920 --> 26:01.999
My first holding hands
in my love affair with God.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.599
Mmm.

26:03.600 --> 26:05.479
So why end it now?

26:05.480 --> 26:08.199
I never gave doubt any space.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.919
You know, once you do, the...

26:10.920 --> 26:14.679
the questions on questions on questions,
you're just... dragged into a vortex.

26:14.680 --> 26:19.439
So, drink, take enough gear,

26:19.440 --> 26:23.439
block the lot - get so twatted,
no coherent thought gets through.

26:24.080 --> 26:25.879
Ha-ha!

26:25.880 --> 26:28.599
Now you can start living!

26:28.600 --> 26:32.599
Yeah. I admire you, Frank.

26:33.320 --> 26:37.319
I'll leave a note for our
Gloria to pay you the rest.

26:39.280 --> 26:41.319
But why do you need me?

26:41.320 --> 26:44.399
You kick these away, you
make sure that I'm dead.

26:44.400 --> 26:47.839
If you get it wrong, I could end
up a cabbage in a wheelchair.

26:47.840 --> 26:51.839
Phwor - enough of them
hanging round my neck already.

26:57.640 --> 27:00.679
Up there?

27:00.680 --> 27:04.679
Full circle.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.039
Watch it!

27:17.040 --> 27:19.959
You're the one who said you wanted
to be like "grown-up friends".

27:19.960 --> 27:21.599
Ooh, touche!

27:21.600 --> 27:25.119
You want me to go out with
someone who's experienced?

27:25.120 --> 27:26.999
I just don't want you
to be disappointed.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.079
What if he's
experienced, but younger?

27:29.080 --> 27:30.759
As long as he's legal.

27:33.840 --> 27:35.079
He's 16 in a month.

27:35.080 --> 27:37.399
It would be like going
with your brother!

27:37.400 --> 27:40.159
As an only child, that
means nothing to me.

27:40.160 --> 27:43.799
How do you know he's done
more than even kiss her?

27:43.800 --> 27:47.079
Are you still a virgin?

27:47.080 --> 27:49.119
No, I lost it when I was 12.

27:49.120 --> 27:52.639
It doesn't follow
that he's experienced.

27:52.640 --> 27:56.519
Suppose that confidence has
got to come from somewhere.

27:56.520 --> 28:00.519
It's just a little matter
of where and when.

28:04.880 --> 28:06.839
Way I see it...

28:06.840 --> 28:10.559
got no faith, you
only got two choices...

28:10.560 --> 28:13.119
live with no hope,

28:13.120 --> 28:16.159
which brings us here. Or...

28:16.160 --> 28:18.399
live with no fear!

28:18.400 --> 28:20.279
i. e....

28:25.240 --> 28:29.039
There! You see that?

28:29.040 --> 28:32.199
Just...

28:32.200 --> 28:36.199
Just do it.

28:45.240 --> 28:49.239
Ugh!

28:53.760 --> 28:55.559
That's a sign!

28:55.560 --> 28:57.519
That fucking hurt!

28:57.520 --> 28:59.039
You've been given a sign!

28:59.040 --> 29:00.399
From who, Frank?

29:00.400 --> 29:02.799
Well, I don't fucking know!

29:02.800 --> 29:04.319
A sign, you know!

29:04.320 --> 29:07.119
Well on the road to Golgotha now.

29:07.120 --> 29:09.359
There's no backing out.

29:09.360 --> 29:13.359
Living a healthier life
will enable me to...

29:14.680 --> 29:18.399
live longer, live more happily,

29:18.400 --> 29:21.799
have better energy...

29:21.800 --> 29:23.999
and...

29:24.000 --> 29:26.479
Be more...

29:26.480 --> 29:27.839
Oh, it's gone.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.759
Comfortable with myself.

29:30.760 --> 29:33.359
Christ, how hard can it be?
Sorry, I...

29:33.360 --> 29:35.839
I...

29:35.840 --> 29:37.079
I...

29:37.080 --> 29:38.519
Ah...

29:38.520 --> 29:39.959
Woah, woah, woah!

29:39.960 --> 29:42.679
Take it easy. Come on.

29:42.680 --> 29:46.679
Deep breaths now, come on.

29:46.840 --> 29:50.439
Now close your eyes...

29:50.440 --> 29:53.039
imagine you're
somewhere special,

29:53.040 --> 29:56.359
and you're doing something
that makes you happy.

29:56.360 --> 29:59.159
Now think of someone with you...

29:59.920 --> 30:03.919
someone who calms
and soothes you...

30:05.000 --> 30:08.679
'Who do you want that to be?

30:08.680 --> 30:12.679
'Now, this person is going to
help you through this task.

30:13.600 --> 30:17.599
'With this person beside you...

30:18.320 --> 30:21.159
'..you can accomplish anything!'

30:23.440 --> 30:25.439
Open your eyes.

30:25.440 --> 30:27.119
You feel better?

30:27.120 --> 30:29.239
Yes, thank you.

30:29.240 --> 30:33.239
You can do this.

30:34.760 --> 30:38.079
No, I couldn't hang meself,
anyway, I'm a physical coward.

30:38.080 --> 30:39.719
Er...

30:39.720 --> 30:43.719
Frank? Get me the biggest bottle
of paracetamol that they've got.

30:43.960 --> 30:45.639
There's no need!

30:45.640 --> 30:48.599
That raspberry in ours, she's got
her own pharmacy...

30:48.600 --> 30:51.399
paracetamol, diazepam,
tramadol...

30:51.400 --> 30:53.479
Get on our settee.

30:53.480 --> 30:56.999
Makes sense to do it
somewhere safe and comfy...

30:57.000 --> 30:58.999
familiar face holding your hand

30:59.000 --> 31:01.719
as you drift gently
into that good night.

31:01.720 --> 31:03.039
Yeah. Are you sure?

31:03.040 --> 31:05.319
Yeah, course. Just
give us, you know,

31:05.320 --> 31:07.559
half an hour to fuck Patty off

31:07.560 --> 31:11.559
and check that Aidan
and Stella are out.

31:12.200 --> 31:16.079
Non-prescription -
these don't come cheap.

31:16.080 --> 31:19.239
Oh, what cost your Christian soul?

31:19.240 --> 31:21.999
What's the point
if they won't kill him?

31:22.000 --> 31:24.079
He'll still be pissed
and fall asleep!

31:24.080 --> 31:24.839
And then what?

31:24.840 --> 31:26.679
I don't fucking know!

31:26.680 --> 31:30.599
Just buys us time to work on him -
just talk him out of it.

31:30.600 --> 31:34.599
Let him get on with it.
Never feckin' liked him anyway.

31:34.920 --> 31:37.679
Emo's ruin - good old paracetamol.

31:37.680 --> 31:40.839
Even if they get there
in time to save you,

31:40.840 --> 31:43.399
your liver'll pack up
within six months.

31:44.480 --> 31:46.599
Thought everyone was out?

31:46.600 --> 31:50.119
Must be Stella's new... cat.

31:50.120 --> 31:52.719
Fuckin' playing at?!

31:52.720 --> 31:56.719
Start thinking like
a manager, not a doer.

31:57.040 --> 32:01.039
It's Lillian's randomness
that I find most effective.

32:01.840 --> 32:04.079
Visualise your own success.

32:04.080 --> 32:07.799
I'd recommend her to anyone
with a busier than average life.

32:07.800 --> 32:10.839
"If you can't make it good,
at least make it look good."

32:10.840 --> 32:14.319
Bill Gates.

32:14.320 --> 32:16.839
Pissing and shitting
everywhere, it's...!

32:16.840 --> 32:20.839
Brought some more - in case.

32:21.960 --> 32:24.359
DIY paracetamol?

32:24.360 --> 32:28.359
One's misfortune -
two's fucking carelessness!

32:29.480 --> 32:31.679
Oh, God, what are
the chances of that?

32:31.680 --> 32:33.759
All right, Dom. Dom,
come on, come on, come on...

32:33.760 --> 32:34.519
Get off!

32:34.520 --> 32:38.519
Come on! Watch the... cat!

32:39.320 --> 32:40.079
You're taking the piss!

32:40.080 --> 32:42.639
Who do you think you're talking to?!

32:42.640 --> 32:45.319
You're the gobshite
taking the overdose!

32:45.320 --> 32:49.319
Have you any idea what that
does to those left behind?!

32:50.160 --> 32:54.159
Those boards should
never have broke!

33:04.520 --> 33:06.479
Who can I trust?!

33:06.480 --> 33:07.959
Me!

33:07.960 --> 33:10.159
Come on - this is
where it all starts!

33:10.160 --> 33:12.879
Two of us - afraid of nothing!

33:12.880 --> 33:15.079
Get a grip, shithouse!

33:15.080 --> 33:16.879
Why doesn't that appeal?

33:16.880 --> 33:20.199
Look, you... think I want
my dabs on these bottles?!

33:20.200 --> 33:23.199
You go to jail for this shit!

33:23.200 --> 33:24.800
Dom...!

33:24.880 --> 33:27.599
I don't know how to say it.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.759
He hasn't even got a bike.

33:29.760 --> 33:32.199
He has.

33:32.200 --> 33:34.359
I don't want to sound like a slag.

33:34.360 --> 33:37.799
You're asking him to come round,
not speak,

33:37.800 --> 33:40.319
just in case talking
"ruins the moment",

33:40.320 --> 33:43.359
shag you on a one-night stand,
then go back to the way it was.

33:43.360 --> 33:47.159
It's pretty difficult to dress
that up any other way.

33:47.160 --> 33:50.959
Give it here.

33:50.960 --> 33:54.959
Something like this?

33:55.040 --> 33:56.159
Maybe.

33:56.160 --> 33:58.039
It's perfect. Just send it!

33:58.040 --> 33:59.839
I'm scared.

33:59.840 --> 34:03.839
I don't know why you'd rather
him than Warren anyway.

34:03.840 --> 34:06.039
Gone!

34:06.040 --> 34:07.599
The blue ones are in the wash.

34:07.600 --> 34:09.359
What about the grey?

34:09.360 --> 34:12.119
'Perfect. I'm thinking red or black
for me?'

34:12.120 --> 34:13.359
Yeah.

34:13.360 --> 34:17.239
'Aidan. I really want you.'

34:17.239 --> 34:20.839
Yeah, can I call you back?
Someone's at the door.

34:20.840 --> 34:23.478
Yes! Get in!

34:42.440 --> 34:45.599
What difference does it make if I
land on one of them?

34:45.600 --> 34:49.599
Take one of them with me?

34:50.760 --> 34:54.079
What point this life you bestowed?!

34:54.080 --> 34:57.159
This... mind?!

34:57.160 --> 35:01.119
This pointless viscera.

35:01.120 --> 35:05.119
Decaying organs, bones, pumping
blood. It means fuck all!

35:13.440 --> 35:17.439
I'm down to the dregs.

35:17.440 --> 35:21.439
Liquid last supper.

35:27.080 --> 35:31.079
Live with no hope,
wither and die.

35:31.840 --> 35:35.599
Or live with no fear. Grab life.

35:35.600 --> 35:39.599
Both hands. Squeeze the living shit
out of it.

35:49.640 --> 35:53.639
Slainte.

36:01.720 --> 36:04.479
And I can't keep off the toilet.

36:04.480 --> 36:06.439
I've noticed.

36:06.440 --> 36:09.639
Her skirt shouldn't be too short.

36:09.640 --> 36:12.879
Except a bit of thigh gives
the right signal.

36:12.880 --> 36:15.319
And what is Aidan going to be like
afterwards?

36:15.320 --> 36:17.519
What if he turns into some
psycho-stalker?

36:17.520 --> 36:19.519
What if she does?

36:19.520 --> 36:21.319
How's that helping?

36:21.320 --> 36:24.759
Just softens it a bit.
You don't mind?

36:24.760 --> 36:26.479
Have you thought all this through?

36:26.480 --> 36:28.199
You are joking?

36:28.200 --> 36:30.519
Just... Aidan. I'm not convinced.

36:30.520 --> 36:31.639
It's too late.

36:31.640 --> 36:33.719
And I've ordered the rohypnol
in case he's shy.

36:33.720 --> 36:34.919
Not funny.

36:34.920 --> 36:37.239
I thought this was what you wanted.

36:37.240 --> 36:38.759
Kind of.

36:38.760 --> 36:42.759
Good. Cos I need Gloria to sort out
my bikini wax.

36:43.920 --> 36:47.919
Keisha's done it.

36:51.360 --> 36:54.679
And a little bonus for your
performance earlier on.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.559
You deserve it.

36:56.560 --> 36:58.919
I learnt a lot about myself.

36:58.920 --> 37:02.719
That's all well and good, but this
is still how you earn a living.

37:02.720 --> 37:05.399
Maybe not for much longer.

37:05.400 --> 37:09.399
Good for you. Turn your business
acumen to any number of things.

37:11.440 --> 37:15.439
Throw in your new "life" skills.
Nothing will stop you.

37:15.560 --> 37:17.799
I'm going to miss you though.

37:17.800 --> 37:21.319
There might be no need. You've got
to act if you want something.

37:21.320 --> 37:24.039
That's right.

37:24.040 --> 37:27.599
No point dwelling, thinking what
might have been.

37:27.600 --> 37:31.519
You can stop now. The test is over.

37:31.520 --> 37:33.359
I know you feel it too.

37:33.360 --> 37:34.879
I need to go.

37:34.880 --> 37:38.119
No, no kissing please!

37:38.120 --> 37:39.799
Let me buy you dinner?

37:39.800 --> 37:41.199
Dinner?!

37:41.200 --> 37:43.519
I want to "shape my own destiny".

37:43.520 --> 37:44.999
And I'm happy for you.

37:45.000 --> 37:48.959
Take control. Let your
rare rose fill you with her scent?

37:48.960 --> 37:51.079
We can get to know each other.

37:51.080 --> 37:52.719
Where?

37:52.720 --> 37:55.519
Maldini's Moston.

37:55.520 --> 37:58.479
I better go home. Freshen up a bit.

37:58.480 --> 37:59.999
You smell OK to me.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.999
Look good. Feel good. You want me
on top form, don't you?

38:06.800 --> 38:09.199
Ravioli. Half price before seven.

38:09.200 --> 38:10.399
Oh, ravioli!

38:10.400 --> 38:11.359
Before seven.

38:11.360 --> 38:15.359
I'll pick you up at six!

38:17.040 --> 38:19.519
Mmmm! Nice.

38:19.520 --> 38:21.679
No mum?

38:21.680 --> 38:24.079
All of a sudden she's gone
squeamish.

38:24.080 --> 38:28.079
Because it's Aidan?

38:32.160 --> 38:34.399
You OK?

38:34.400 --> 38:38.399
Yeah. Never better.

38:39.760 --> 38:43.079
It's Letitia's first time.

38:43.080 --> 38:45.599
Oh...

38:45.600 --> 38:47.879
And we sanction this do we?

38:47.880 --> 38:50.999
Well, Avril's opted for experience
over true love,

38:51.000 --> 38:53.439
so you need to make yourself scarce.

38:53.440 --> 38:54.839
Right.

38:54.840 --> 38:58.119
I think you should get some...

38:58.120 --> 38:59.279
help.

38:59.280 --> 39:02.639
Oh, no. No need.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.919
This bullshit's over.

39:04.920 --> 39:08.919
I'm as clear as I've ever been.

39:09.840 --> 39:13.799
Fuck guilt...

39:13.800 --> 39:17.799
Fuck God.

39:21.120 --> 39:25.119
I'm living for me.

39:31.720 --> 39:35.559
His wife might not like the idea.

39:35.560 --> 39:38.039
Who says he's married?!

39:38.040 --> 39:42.039
Come on! Statistically,
90% of them are.

39:42.600 --> 39:46.599
Even if he is, she can't mess
with what's meant to be.

39:55.920 --> 39:58.559
Oh, aye. Sniffing your pits,
must be serious.

39:58.560 --> 40:00.359
I'm meeting Letitia.

40:00.360 --> 40:01.959
What, round here?

40:01.960 --> 40:05.159
Watch a film or something.
Our DVD's broke.

40:05.160 --> 40:06.399
Gloria said we could.

40:06.400 --> 40:09.159
I wondered why she was here earlier.
She didn't tell you?

40:09.160 --> 40:12.079
That older kid with the souped-up
hairdryer?

40:12.080 --> 40:13.639
Warren?

40:13.640 --> 40:15.919
Yeah, that's him. About an hour ago.

40:15.920 --> 40:18.399
She was a bit unsure but he talked
her into it.

40:18.400 --> 40:21.799
Bit of a smooth operator.

40:21.800 --> 40:23.879
Haven't you got a girlfriend?

40:23.880 --> 40:27.879
If she's still speaking to me.

40:28.760 --> 40:31.519
Well, it can get messy so close
to home.

40:31.520 --> 40:34.239
Once you take that step it changes
everything.

40:34.240 --> 40:38.239
Never go back to being mates.

40:40.400 --> 40:43.319
Easy come.

40:43.320 --> 40:47.319
Easy go.

40:58.680 --> 41:00.159
Still no sign of him?

41:00.160 --> 41:03.199
I thought you were going to bed?

41:03.200 --> 41:07.199
Don't worry, I won't intrude.

41:07.320 --> 41:10.959
So what's your dad's take on all
of this?

41:10.960 --> 41:14.959
I don't think he knows.

41:18.640 --> 41:21.039
How long are you going to give him?

41:21.040 --> 41:22.199
Not much more.

41:22.200 --> 41:23.599
That might look a bit keen.

41:23.600 --> 41:26.239
That's what I was thinking.

41:26.240 --> 41:30.239
Do I know him?

41:30.480 --> 41:32.119
Aidan.

41:32.120 --> 41:35.439
Well, he's a very lucky lad.

41:35.440 --> 41:39.439
There's got to be some explanation
then, eh?

41:40.400 --> 41:44.399
Probably his girlfriend.

41:49.480 --> 41:52.679
So how come Aidan if it's all about
"experience"?

41:52.680 --> 41:55.599
Mum was the one going on about that.

41:55.600 --> 41:57.959
Sometimes mums knows best.

41:57.960 --> 41:59.479
You reckon?

41:59.480 --> 42:03.479
Yeah. Definitely.

42:03.800 --> 42:07.159
You know, I can tell you some
of the benefits if you really want.

42:07.160 --> 42:10.799
Like not getting stuck
on a bra strap?

42:10.800 --> 42:14.799
The truly experienced man should
always execute that manoeuvre

42:15.440 --> 42:16.799
with his teeth.

42:20.120 --> 42:23.399
Fingers and thumbs are for...

42:23.400 --> 42:27.399
the really delicate stuff.

42:32.400 --> 42:36.399
"Build it and he will come."

42:37.640 --> 42:40.279
I know what I need to do.

42:40.280 --> 42:44.279
Forget all this hocus-pocus
bollocks. Golden rule number one.

42:44.640 --> 42:48.439
If I focus on the future...
Rule number one!

42:48.440 --> 42:49.999
Lillian.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.239
Never fall for a punter.

42:52.240 --> 42:53.519
Never!

42:53.520 --> 42:55.799
My looks won't last much longer.

42:55.800 --> 42:59.799
More than all of us, you know this
isn't the place to find love.

43:01.560 --> 43:03.959
I can tell Malcolm's different.

43:03.960 --> 43:07.799
We pretend they're special
for their benefit.

43:07.800 --> 43:10.199
It gets dangerous if we blur
the boundaries.

43:10.200 --> 43:12.479
Let them live with the denial,

43:12.480 --> 43:15.119
live that lie every day,
skulking around

43:15.120 --> 43:17.599
behind their wives'
and girlfriends' backs.

43:17.600 --> 43:21.599
He's the same as all the others.

43:23.040 --> 43:26.759
So why say I'm a rose?

43:26.760 --> 43:30.759
So you'd try your hardest?

43:32.480 --> 43:34.239
I'll show him.

43:34.240 --> 43:38.239
Thinks I'm a mug?
Receipt for Malcolm Palmer.

43:41.400 --> 43:42.679
Got it.

43:42.680 --> 43:43.759
Visa? Mastercard?

43:43.760 --> 43:45.159
Visa.

43:45.160 --> 43:48.919
4921... 81...

43:48.920 --> 43:52.919
Look. The best way,
whether he went...

43:58.080 --> 44:02.079
Bloody hell is that?!

44:02.880 --> 44:05.039
Excuse me?

44:05.040 --> 44:07.279
"Dildos"? What's that?

44:07.280 --> 44:11.279
Nobody plays Lillian Tyler.

44:14.040 --> 44:18.039
'40 years of faith and trust
and belief, for what?'

44:18.880 --> 44:21.799
'What good did the sacrifice do?'

44:21.800 --> 44:25.639
'What have I contributed to the grand
sum of the human well-being?

44:25.640 --> 44:27.639
'Not a fucking jot.'

44:27.640 --> 44:30.319
'I could mourn the lost time,
say it was a waste,

44:30.320 --> 44:34.159
'but that's not true. I got something
from it, I got me,

44:34.160 --> 44:36.519
'I got the tools I carry, that makes
me the man I am today.

44:36.520 --> 44:39.399
'And that puts me in a good place.

44:39.400 --> 44:42.679
'To wreak some fucking havoc.'

44:42.680 --> 44:46.679
I hope you're gone by the morning.

44:47.480 --> 44:51.479
See? I told you.

44:53.680 --> 44:56.119
I'm good.

45:21.077 --> 45:40.036

45:44.900 --> 45:46.819
Morning!

45:46.820 --> 45:49.099
Good morning!

45:49.100 --> 45:52.819
Somebody's popped their cherry!

45:52.820 --> 45:54.499
Front door and back.

45:54.500 --> 45:58.499
Baptism of fire.
