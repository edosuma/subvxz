01:41.412 --> 01:44.037
- [Kevin] Okay, so imagine that this piece

01:44.037 --> 01:46.478
of paper right here is the app, okay.

01:46.478 --> 01:48.613
- [Guy] What's an app?

01:48.613 --> 01:50.414
- [Kevin] An application,

01:50.414 --> 01:54.767
you know, you use it to interface
with electronic devices.

01:54.767 --> 01:55.804
- [Guy] What?

01:55.804 --> 01:57.582
- [Kevin] Those little games
you play in your phone,

01:57.582 --> 01:59.422
does that ringing any bells?

01:59.422 --> 02:00.294
- [Guy] Like a gizmo?

02:00.294 --> 02:01.127
- [Male 1] Yeah, sure.

02:01.127 --> 02:02.964
Whatever works for you.

02:02.964 --> 02:04.805
- [Guy] What's the point?

02:04.805 --> 02:06.245
- [Kevin] Well I mean the point is

02:06.245 --> 02:09.300
it introduce yourself an
like an interesting way.

02:09.300 --> 02:10.133
You know.

02:10.133 --> 02:12.225
- [Guy] Why don't you just
go up and talk to her.

02:12.225 --> 02:14.000
- [Kevin] Because that's not cool.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.520
I mean you can't just walk up to her,

02:15.520 --> 02:16.353
so I write her a note instead.

02:16.353 --> 02:17.965
You just want to write a note.

02:17.965 --> 02:18.909
That's more interesting, you know.

02:18.909 --> 02:20.647
So you do this, watch, watch.

02:20.647 --> 02:22.729
- [Guy] Hey, yodi, I'm Kevin.

02:22.729 --> 02:23.889
- [Kevin] Yeah, yeah.

02:23.889 --> 02:25.606
- [Guy] What's a yodi?

02:25.606 --> 02:27.810
- [Kevin] Alright, just no
more questions please, please.

02:27.810 --> 02:29.322
Alright, so what I'm gonna do is

02:29.322 --> 02:32.126
I'm just going to rip this guy right here.

02:32.126 --> 02:33.221
Do that.

02:33.221 --> 02:34.741
Do this.

02:34.741 --> 02:35.574
Alrighty,

02:35.574 --> 02:36.636
so I'm gonna throw it over to her.

02:36.636 --> 02:37.469
- You're gonna throw it.

02:37.469 --> 02:40.101
- Yeah, and it's gonna
land next to her hand.

02:40.101 --> 02:41.440
And then she's gonna see it,

02:41.440 --> 02:42.425
and she's gonna open it up

02:42.425 --> 02:43.258
and be like "oh my God,

02:43.258 --> 02:44.518
"this beautiful man
just wrote this for me,

02:44.518 --> 02:46.216
"he must be so attractive
and probably owns

02:46.216 --> 02:47.736
"like really nice cars."

02:47.736 --> 02:48.872
So just get ready, alright.

02:48.872 --> 02:49.915
Here I go.

02:49.915 --> 02:51.332
No, no, trust me.

02:52.501 --> 02:53.952
- Where's my shake?

02:53.952 --> 02:55.948
- This guy's been bothering me all day.

02:55.948 --> 02:56.781
Okay.

02:56.781 --> 02:57.614
No, no, let me throw it.

02:57.614 --> 02:58.447
- Don't.

02:58.447 --> 02:59.654
- Oh my God, okay.

02:59.654 --> 03:00.951
Um, um, um, oh my God.

03:00.951 --> 03:02.438
Okay, I'm gonna go do that.

03:02.438 --> 03:04.771
And I'm gonna be right back.

03:11.764 --> 03:12.636
- Kevin.

03:12.636 --> 03:13.639
- Sir.

03:13.639 --> 03:15.044
- Did you clean the men's room?

03:15.044 --> 03:16.404
- Yes sir, yes, it is pristine.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.500
- So that's why the toilet

03:18.500 --> 03:20.500
is covered with poo?

03:20.500 --> 03:22.476
- Sir, I promise I will get done with it

03:22.476 --> 03:23.309
as soon as possible,

03:23.309 --> 03:24.244
but really I need to get over there.

03:24.244 --> 03:25.566
- No, no, you need to do it now.

03:25.566 --> 03:26.622
- No, no, no please sir.

03:26.622 --> 03:27.789
Oh, oh my God.

03:39.736 --> 03:40.847
- Kevin?

03:40.847 --> 03:42.014
What's a yodi?

03:46.624 --> 03:48.559
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

03:48.559 --> 03:50.512
Oh, oh, oh Bertha.

03:50.512 --> 03:52.296
Bertha, no, no, no honey.

03:52.296 --> 03:53.258
You remember all the times

03:53.258 --> 03:54.679
that we've gone together,

03:54.679 --> 03:56.075
and we've done great things,

03:56.075 --> 03:57.474
but please, come on please.

03:57.474 --> 03:58.307
You're gone.

03:58.307 --> 03:59.140
Oh my God.

04:00.277 --> 04:03.444
Son of a (horn beeps)

04:05.500 --> 04:06.756
oh shit.

04:06.756 --> 04:07.923
Oh that's hot.

04:09.717 --> 04:10.900
Hey guys.

04:10.900 --> 04:12.182
My car broke down.

04:12.182 --> 04:13.877
- Hey Kevin, catch.

04:13.877 --> 04:16.293
(boys laugh)

04:19.920 --> 04:21.112
I got him boys.

04:21.112 --> 04:22.997
- Hey, hey, Tyler.

04:22.997 --> 04:25.040
It's your favorite cousin.

04:25.040 --> 04:25.873
Kevin.

04:27.395 --> 04:28.587
Kevin Cassidy.

04:28.587 --> 04:30.333
Yeah, yeah, that's me.

04:30.333 --> 04:31.533
So the reason why I'm calling

04:31.533 --> 04:33.132
is because I have this new app

04:33.132 --> 04:34.653
and it's called Ice Breaker

04:34.653 --> 04:36.016
and everyone loves it,

04:36.016 --> 04:37.731
and I need to live in Austin.

04:37.731 --> 04:39.150
And you live in Austin,

04:39.150 --> 04:42.150
so I need to live with you for free.

04:43.896 --> 04:44.979
Yeah, really?

04:46.605 --> 04:47.438
No.

04:48.967 --> 04:50.195
Oh my God.

04:50.195 --> 04:51.355
Wow.

04:51.355 --> 04:52.971
This is so exciting.

04:52.971 --> 04:54.672
Well I just got halfway done

04:54.672 --> 04:56.413
rolling my socks.

04:56.413 --> 04:57.496
No, don't worry about,

04:57.496 --> 04:58.653
I'll take a bus.

04:58.653 --> 04:59.781
I'll take a train.

04:59.781 --> 05:01.555
I will piggyback with the hobo.

05:01.555 --> 05:02.637
I will do anything.

05:02.637 --> 05:03.795
I will be there, okay.

05:03.795 --> 05:04.682
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

05:04.682 --> 05:05.758
I'll see you then.

05:05.758 --> 05:06.925
Okay, goodbye.

05:08.113 --> 05:08.952
Man.

05:08.952 --> 05:10.244
Poor Bertha.

05:10.244 --> 05:11.700
See, it's not hard to talk to people.

05:11.700 --> 05:12.867
You can do it.

05:15.926 --> 05:16.946
My name's Mr. Sock.

05:16.946 --> 05:17.985
I'm gonna go to Austin.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.152
Yay, yay, yay.

05:20.522 --> 05:21.636
I'm going too.

05:21.636 --> 05:24.789
♫ This year's gonna be the year

05:24.789 --> 05:27.868
♫ That I get ahead,

05:27.868 --> 05:29.810
♫ Get a life and get a job

05:29.810 --> 05:31.551
♫ I'll move on,

05:31.551 --> 05:32.949
♫ Move forward,

05:32.949 --> 05:37.368

♫ That my dreams come true

05:44.347 --> 05:47.665
♫ I'm gonna read the paper in the morning,

05:47.665 --> 05:49.039
♫ Do the crossword

05:49.039 --> 05:50.731
♫ And talk to my neighbor

05:50.731 --> 05:53.966
♫ But I'll be the same guy

05:53.966 --> 05:56.373
♫ That I was last year

05:56.373 --> 05:58.325
♫ And the year before

05:58.325 --> 06:01.730
♫ I'll be the same guy

06:01.730 --> 06:03.285
♫ That I was the last year

06:03.285 --> 06:05.645
♫ And the year before

06:05.645 --> 06:07.445
♫ I'm gonna stop right now

06:07.445 --> 06:11.112
♫ Baby walk it out the door

06:27.527 --> 06:29.927
- Hey, hey, hey what the hell man.

06:29.927 --> 06:31.677
What the hell.

06:31.677 --> 06:32.674
- [Kevin] Don't worry about it.

06:32.674 --> 06:34.321
- Jumped out of my trunk.

06:34.321 --> 06:38.404
Knew I shouldn't have
taken my meds this morning.

06:41.866 --> 06:43.975
- [Radio Man] Are people fake as shit?

06:43.975 --> 06:46.855
Do you want to just quit your job

06:46.855 --> 06:49.031
and move to India?

06:49.031 --> 06:49.864
Join me.

06:50.883 --> 06:52.600
My name's Matt Carlson.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.320
And I'm picking up people
from all over the country

06:55.320 --> 06:57.650
to fly into India with me.

06:57.650 --> 06:59.458
- Hey, hey Tyler.

06:59.458 --> 07:02.318
- [Tyler] Hey what's up man?

07:02.318 --> 07:03.852
- I well I think I'm here.

07:03.852 --> 07:05.073
I'm just calling to make sure

07:05.073 --> 07:06.454
that everything's lined up.

07:06.454 --> 07:07.287
Are we good?

07:07.287 --> 07:08.390
- [Tyler] Ah, I don't know man.

07:08.390 --> 07:10.233
I'm just sick of all these fake people.

07:10.233 --> 07:11.252
- Tyler?

07:11.252 --> 07:13.156
- [Tyler] All day I'm in this nice suit,

07:13.156 --> 07:16.539
just sucking up to
these plastic mannequins

07:16.539 --> 07:17.797
with dead eyes--

07:17.797 --> 07:20.130
(dial tone)

07:28.612 --> 07:30.620
- How about that one coming
out of the ballet studio?

07:30.620 --> 07:32.123
- You know ballerina's are graceful,

07:32.123 --> 07:33.723
that's my kind of thing.

07:33.723 --> 07:35.345
Like graceful women, you know.

07:35.345 --> 07:37.185
With a smooth walk.

07:37.185 --> 07:39.982
- Oh man, I see a cougar
coming back from sixth street.

07:39.982 --> 07:41.262
What do you think of that?

07:41.262 --> 07:43.479
- I don't know, I can't really
handle cougars right now.

07:43.479 --> 07:44.878
They want money,

07:44.878 --> 07:46.363
and let's be realistic,

07:46.363 --> 07:48.178
it's not that time for me.

07:48.178 --> 07:50.718
I'm kind of in a rough time.

07:50.718 --> 07:51.801
But I can play that off.

07:51.801 --> 07:52.950
That's why I got you, Rocky,

07:52.950 --> 07:53.824
we're all good.

07:53.824 --> 07:54.657
- Oh yeah.

07:54.657 --> 07:56.336
Oh shit, is that a roller derby girl.

07:56.336 --> 07:57.599
- Oh my gosh, they're rough.

07:57.599 --> 07:58.913
But that's cool.

07:58.913 --> 08:00.511
I mean I could play that game too.

08:00.511 --> 08:01.344
- Okay.

08:01.344 --> 08:02.282
- Okay.

08:02.282 --> 08:03.365
Play it cool.

08:04.800 --> 08:09.241
Hey, ask about me lifting
weights when we walk by.

08:09.241 --> 08:10.074
Hey, hey,

08:11.575 --> 08:13.132
you want a ride on me?

08:13.132 --> 08:14.273
- Excuse me?

08:14.273 --> 08:16.440
- Do you want a free ride?

08:20.403 --> 08:21.236
Alright.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.377
What a nice day.

08:25.263 --> 08:26.096
- Great.

08:27.762 --> 08:29.983
- So, where are you going?

08:29.983 --> 08:31.684
You know some say love is blind.

08:31.684 --> 08:33.589
But I think it's deaf actually.

08:33.589 --> 08:34.422
- Whoa.

08:34.422 --> 08:35.777
- Hey are you alright man?

08:35.777 --> 08:37.033
- Yeah I'm fine.

08:37.033 --> 08:38.956
I'm just trying to find the 12 Seasons,

08:38.956 --> 08:39.789
but my app is all...

08:39.789 --> 08:41.301
- 12 Seasons is like right over there.

08:41.301 --> 08:42.514
- oh it's working now, it's working.

08:42.514 --> 08:45.411
- No, you can literally see it.

08:45.411 --> 08:46.887
- Oh, huh,

08:46.887 --> 08:48.002
well look at that.

08:48.002 --> 08:49.148
That's cool.

08:49.148 --> 08:50.991
Well, can you hold this for me?

08:50.991 --> 08:52.028
- Ah, no.

08:52.028 --> 08:54.031
- I just thought that maybe if it was cool

08:54.031 --> 08:55.769
that I could just ride with y'all.

08:55.769 --> 08:56.788
Wouldn't that be fun.

08:56.788 --> 08:57.621
- Not really.

08:57.621 --> 08:58.938
- Can you scooch it for me?

08:58.938 --> 09:00.483
- You know what, there's
so much room anyways, so.

09:00.483 --> 09:01.685
- This is pretty cozy.

09:01.685 --> 09:02.842
Thank you so much.

09:02.842 --> 09:04.117
Chariots away.

09:04.117 --> 09:05.073
- That's cool.

09:05.073 --> 09:05.906
Alright.

09:07.131 --> 09:08.856
- I've never been on one
of these things before.

09:08.856 --> 09:09.689
How fast can you go?

09:09.689 --> 09:10.956
Like 20 miles per hour.

09:10.956 --> 09:12.479
- You have like the luggage

09:12.479 --> 09:15.155
of like a 1920s grandpa.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.069
- Yeah, yeah,

09:16.069 --> 09:17.237
it's vintage.

09:17.237 --> 09:19.904
(calming music)

09:25.026 --> 09:27.208
- I'm Kevin Cassidy.

09:27.208 --> 09:28.726
- Hi Kevin.

09:28.726 --> 09:29.559
- Hi.

09:30.567 --> 09:31.400
So, uh...

09:33.362 --> 09:35.115
So you from here?

09:35.115 --> 09:36.197
I'm not from here.
- Born and raised.

09:36.197 --> 09:39.197
- I don't live in this neighborhood.

09:41.892 --> 09:45.392
Is it really as weird as everyone says?

09:45.392 --> 09:46.443
- Not really.

09:46.443 --> 09:47.888
- You know weird isn't enough.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.213
That's how I'd put it, honestly.

09:49.213 --> 09:50.046
- Gotcha.

09:52.272 --> 09:57.008
Um, you know I actually,
uh, I don't live here.

09:57.008 --> 09:58.385
I just work here.

09:58.385 --> 09:59.954
- I had no idea you weren't from here.

09:59.954 --> 10:01.453
I couldn't tell at all.

10:01.453 --> 10:03.677
- I'm actually here to sell my app.

10:03.677 --> 10:05.550
- That's really creative.

10:05.550 --> 10:07.368
- That's genius, it's genius man.

10:07.368 --> 10:08.789
- It's like if you know, if you wanted

10:08.789 --> 10:10.813
to talk to a girl and
you wanted to, you know,

10:10.813 --> 10:13.117
talk with here without
actually having to talk to her,

10:13.117 --> 10:15.117
you do the ice breaker and you

10:15.117 --> 10:18.073
(car horn honks)
break the ice.

10:18.073 --> 10:20.728
You're able to talk to her,
maybe take her on a date.

10:20.728 --> 10:22.750
- Can you scoot over or something?

10:22.750 --> 10:24.739
- I legitimately can't.

10:24.739 --> 10:26.406
- Welp, here we are.

10:27.887 --> 10:28.920
- Wow.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.708
- Heaven on Earth, 12 Seasons.

10:30.708 --> 10:32.603
- Very cool, how much?

10:32.603 --> 10:33.598
- It's about five bucks.

10:33.598 --> 10:34.609
- It's about 20 bucks.

10:34.609 --> 10:36.041
Hey listen, we kick ass.

10:36.041 --> 10:38.011
We're a squad, we're a team, okay?

10:38.011 --> 10:41.467
We make money, I get a
split, I got 20%, it's cool.

10:41.467 --> 10:42.971
- Yeah, 20.

10:42.971 --> 10:44.966
- Twenty'll do.

10:44.966 --> 10:47.205
- Well there you go.

10:47.205 --> 10:48.705
- Want any change?

10:50.467 --> 10:51.958
- Uh, nah.

10:51.958 --> 10:53.443
Nah I'm good.

10:53.443 --> 10:55.943
So, um, I was thinking that...

10:59.434 --> 11:01.273
So I'll see you around?

11:01.273 --> 11:02.106
- Maybe.

11:04.954 --> 11:06.511
- You sure?

11:06.511 --> 11:09.511
- No I'm good, don't worry about it.

11:10.447 --> 11:11.280
- Alright.

11:12.991 --> 11:14.967
Let's get outta here.

11:14.967 --> 11:16.550
- Toodle-do, bitch.

11:23.190 --> 11:24.812
- Hi, how may I help you?

11:24.812 --> 11:26.815
- Hi, I'm Kevin Cassidy.

11:26.815 --> 11:29.168
My cousin said he would
schedule me an interview

11:29.168 --> 11:30.869
- And who might your cousin be?

11:30.869 --> 11:32.286
- Tyler Williams.

11:34.065 --> 11:36.211
- Tyler no longer works here.

11:36.211 --> 11:37.893
- Really, since when?

11:37.893 --> 11:38.726
- This morning.

11:38.726 --> 11:39.725
(record scratch)

11:39.725 --> 11:43.190
- 12 Seasons, can I got
your continental breakfast?

11:43.190 --> 11:45.364
Maybe a banana up your ass!?

11:45.364 --> 11:46.781
- Interview? Yes?

11:48.091 --> 11:49.588
No? Okay.

11:49.588 --> 11:52.171
Well, um, you have a great day.

11:53.566 --> 11:54.801
Are you sure?

11:54.801 --> 11:56.202
I didn't even know him that well.

11:56.202 --> 11:57.035
(knocks)

11:57.035 --> 11:57.868
Tyler, come on.

11:57.868 --> 11:59.201
Answer the door.

12:01.140 --> 12:03.597
I rolled my socks for you man, I'm tired.

12:03.597 --> 12:06.354
I had to go into a truck,
it's been really tiring.

12:06.354 --> 12:07.235
I know stuff's rough.

12:07.235 --> 12:08.152
Whoa, jeez.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.313
Whoa, whoa.

12:11.274 --> 12:13.137
- [Tyler] My sweet dear boy, Kevin.

12:13.137 --> 12:16.039
I've escaped this
madhouse you call society.

12:16.039 --> 12:19.281
I'm sick of all the posers
flaking their way through life.

12:19.281 --> 12:22.149
India is calling my name.

12:22.149 --> 12:23.649
The name of Tyler.

12:24.516 --> 12:25.599
- Son of a...

12:27.962 --> 12:28.795
Bulldog.

12:40.645 --> 12:42.714
Hey petty, pedi-cab guy?

12:42.714 --> 12:43.891
- Oh shit.

12:43.891 --> 12:45.493
- What're you doing here?

12:45.493 --> 12:46.547
Do you live here?

12:46.547 --> 12:48.797
- Next door, unfortunately.

12:49.713 --> 12:51.553
What're you doing here?

12:51.553 --> 12:53.110
- I was supposed to live here.

12:53.110 --> 12:55.249
Like right there.

12:55.249 --> 12:56.607
- Do you know Tyler?

12:56.607 --> 12:59.309
- Yeah, he's my cousin.

12:59.309 --> 13:02.476
But, uh, apparently he moved to India.

13:03.317 --> 13:05.117
- Yeah, he said something actually about

13:05.117 --> 13:06.450
leaving his key.

13:08.854 --> 13:09.858
- Howdy, neighbor.

13:09.858 --> 13:11.322
Want to trade foot massages?

13:11.322 --> 13:13.378
Hey there neighbor, I
found a wart on my sole.

13:13.378 --> 13:14.211
Well hey there neighbor.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.115
Hey there neighbor.

13:15.115 --> 13:16.117
Hey there neighbor.

13:16.117 --> 13:17.295
I love you so much.

13:17.295 --> 13:19.846
You're my favorite neighbor.

13:19.846 --> 13:21.380
- His cousin's stranded.

13:21.380 --> 13:23.561
- That's what he did?
- Sorry about that.

13:23.561 --> 13:24.890
That sucks.

13:24.890 --> 13:26.802
You know, I actually
know a ton of cool places

13:26.802 --> 13:29.722
you can stay that are not
right here next door to me.

13:29.722 --> 13:32.472
- Could you maybe give me a ride?

13:35.336 --> 13:37.243
Yeah, let's go.

13:37.243 --> 13:38.076
- Sure.

13:39.073 --> 13:40.080
I don't care.

13:40.080 --> 13:43.019
I don't care about my wife.

13:43.019 --> 13:44.352
- Oh, thank you.

13:46.234 --> 13:48.852
- It's 30 bucks a night, can't beat that.

13:48.852 --> 13:50.351
- I got 16.

13:50.351 --> 13:51.909
- 16 total?

13:51.909 --> 13:53.332
- Yeah.

13:53.332 --> 13:55.994
- Okay, this whole me
carrying your bags thing?

13:55.994 --> 13:57.244
Ends right now.

13:58.523 --> 14:01.025
Thought I was getting a tip for this.

14:01.025 --> 14:02.609
- Oh, uh...

14:02.609 --> 14:03.442
Okay.

14:06.059 --> 14:10.228
- Kevin, here's the 20
you gave me Daddy Warbags.

14:10.228 --> 14:12.344
You can pay me back by coming to my show.

14:12.344 --> 14:14.084
- Oh, thank you so much.

14:14.084 --> 14:16.599
Great, when is it so I
can put it in my phone?

14:16.599 --> 14:18.091
- It's 22nd, Friday.

14:18.091 --> 14:20.861
- Okay yeah, I'll do that right now.

14:20.861 --> 14:22.506
- Yeah, do whatever you want bud.

14:22.506 --> 14:24.039
Don't forget.

14:24.039 --> 14:26.381
They kick you out after seven days.

14:26.381 --> 14:28.607
- Okay, well thank you.

14:28.607 --> 14:31.066
- Yeah, you can thank me.

14:31.066 --> 14:33.146
And I hope you do, big time.

14:33.146 --> 14:33.979
- [Kevin] Yep.

14:33.979 --> 14:35.370
- So where you from Kevin?

14:35.370 --> 14:36.890
- Oh, I'm from Lubbock.

14:36.890 --> 14:39.140
- Well Lubbock or leave it.

14:40.125 --> 14:41.824
Arlgiht, you're all set, room three,

14:41.824 --> 14:43.504
down the hall on the right.

14:43.504 --> 14:45.342
- So where is it, sorry?

14:45.342 --> 14:48.406
- It's across from the
space cowboy armadillo.

14:48.406 --> 14:49.961
He's the only one who smokes inside,

14:49.961 --> 14:51.379
don't get any ideas now.

14:51.379 --> 14:52.881
- I'll try not to.

14:52.881 --> 14:56.214
(acoustic guitar music)

15:24.771 --> 15:25.950
Hey there.

15:25.950 --> 15:26.783
- Hello.

15:28.164 --> 15:30.123
- What're you reading there?

15:30.123 --> 15:31.040
- Ginsberg.

15:32.180 --> 15:33.647
- I didn't know you
guys had two paintings.

15:33.647 --> 15:34.763
- Yeah dude, they all do.

15:34.763 --> 15:35.635
- Okay boys.

15:35.635 --> 15:40.043
- What're you homos doing
inside, it's a Friday night.

15:40.043 --> 15:42.335
I mean, unless you are homos.

15:42.335 --> 15:43.335
That's cool.

15:44.234 --> 15:46.431
We're going drinking, if you're thirsty.

15:46.431 --> 15:48.843
- Sorry, I just, I gotta work on this app.

15:48.843 --> 15:49.724
- At night?

15:49.724 --> 15:51.408
- You got any razors, Eric?

15:51.408 --> 15:53.569
- Nah sorry Dave, I shaved before we came.

15:53.569 --> 15:54.613
- No worries.

15:54.613 --> 15:56.442
- How about you, Wowza?

15:56.442 --> 15:59.192
- I have a poetry slam to attend.

16:00.222 --> 16:01.316
- Alright.

16:01.316 --> 16:04.358
- Quickest shave ever, you ready?

16:04.358 --> 16:06.014
- Let's do this.

16:06.014 --> 16:08.421
- Aroo, see you boys.

16:08.421 --> 16:12.442
- Gosh, they're even more
brutish than I'd imagined.

16:12.442 --> 16:13.439
- Who them?

16:13.439 --> 16:14.661
- Yes them.

16:14.661 --> 16:16.581
Modern day dinosaurs.

16:16.581 --> 16:21.521
Pooping and eating without
any intelligent thought.

16:21.521 --> 16:23.521
- So then why are you here?

16:23.521 --> 16:26.758
- My father used to
hostel when he was young.

16:26.758 --> 16:30.965
Thinks it's supposed to
build character or something.

16:30.965 --> 16:32.874
Sure you don't wanna come?

16:32.874 --> 16:34.328
- Oh, uh, sorry.

16:34.328 --> 16:36.133
I just gotta work on this app.

16:36.133 --> 16:37.466
- Suit yourself.

16:44.054 --> 16:45.509
- Oh yes, I did it.

16:45.509 --> 16:46.751
- Did what?

16:46.751 --> 16:48.527
- Oh uh, nothing.

16:48.527 --> 16:49.826
- You sell your app yet?

16:49.826 --> 16:52.493
- Get your shit off my bed, man.

16:54.529 --> 16:56.759
- Apparently there's a sick party

16:56.759 --> 16:58.851
for you tonight, if you want to come.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.264
- Oh, I'm way too busy or I would.

17:01.264 --> 17:02.260
- Doing what?

17:02.260 --> 17:04.694
Beating your Angry Dog score?

17:04.694 --> 17:06.694
Dude, you need to relax.

17:07.585 --> 17:09.675
- Oh, I don't have a glass.

17:09.675 --> 17:11.406
- Yeah, strike one buddy.

17:11.406 --> 17:12.671
Strike one.

17:12.671 --> 17:14.353
- Oh yeah, that's mine.

17:14.353 --> 17:17.789
- You guys just share out
of the same thing, okay.

17:17.789 --> 17:20.353
- What'd you think man, ready
to have a good time, eh?

17:20.353 --> 17:22.113
- You know you want to.

17:22.113 --> 17:24.780
- Alright, it can't be that bad.

17:26.266 --> 17:28.599
- That's what I like to see.

17:30.115 --> 17:31.282
- Wow, that...

17:32.192 --> 17:35.777
Looks like we're gonna go to a party.

17:35.777 --> 17:36.796
Nope.

17:36.796 --> 17:40.963
("We'll Get High" by Willy McGee)

18:06.249 --> 18:09.268
- ♫ Here we go again, cigarettes and gin

18:09.268 --> 18:13.630
- ♫ Only feels right 'cause
some might accept it tonight.

18:13.630 --> 18:14.503
- Oh, ho.

18:14.503 --> 18:16.628
- I know, that's stupid, but I wrote it

18:16.628 --> 18:18.225
and I feel like it could be a hit.

18:18.225 --> 18:19.369
- I love it, it's a hit.

18:19.369 --> 18:20.565
- You think so?

18:20.565 --> 18:21.988
My first hit single.

18:21.988 --> 18:23.148
- This is a hit.

18:23.148 --> 18:24.270
- That's a hit?

18:24.270 --> 18:25.687
- Is it a spliff?

18:26.561 --> 18:27.394
- Maybe.

18:29.165 --> 18:32.980
You know a French guy left it on my table.

18:32.980 --> 18:35.015
- I can't believe you just grabbed a guy

18:35.015 --> 18:37.199
from the party and took
him up to your room.

18:37.199 --> 18:38.354
- Yeah.

18:38.354 --> 18:39.920
Grabbed the French one.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.587
That's what happened

18:43.253 --> 18:44.693
- When is it the right time to shake

18:44.693 --> 18:46.916
someone's hand at a party?

18:46.916 --> 18:49.760
- What're you talking about,
no one shakes hands at a party.

18:49.760 --> 18:50.677
Wait, what?

18:52.479 --> 18:53.312
Oh my God.

18:54.668 --> 18:55.902
You think he's undercover?

18:55.902 --> 18:58.791
- Either that or he's the
most awkward dude ever.

18:58.791 --> 19:00.826
I kina wanna mess with him.

19:00.826 --> 19:03.287
- Wait, wait guys, seriously
I don't know anyone here,

19:03.287 --> 19:04.947
- Dude, dude!
- I'm freaking out.

19:04.947 --> 19:06.487
- You need to relax.

19:06.487 --> 19:08.444
- That's strike three, bro.

19:08.444 --> 19:09.923
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

19:09.923 --> 19:11.644
I did not see you there.

19:11.644 --> 19:12.538
- It's okay.

19:12.538 --> 19:13.483
It's alright.

19:13.483 --> 19:14.499
- Do you need a light?

19:14.499 --> 19:15.538
- Oh, oh no.

19:15.538 --> 19:17.123
I don't smoke.

19:17.123 --> 19:18.040
- Oh, okay.

19:24.291 --> 19:25.755
So who are you?

19:25.755 --> 19:27.890
- Oh, I'm Kevin Cassidy.

19:27.890 --> 19:29.952
That's my first and last name.

19:29.952 --> 19:32.176
I'm here to sell my app, yeah.

19:32.176 --> 19:36.272
- Oh, you came to a
party to sell your app.

19:36.272 --> 19:38.976
- Oh, oh not in particular.

19:38.976 --> 19:42.453
It's like, um, it's like
a phone that helps you

19:42.453 --> 19:44.120
talk with strangers.

19:46.673 --> 19:49.167
- That's a really bad idea.

19:49.167 --> 19:51.750
It's a really fucking bad idea.

19:52.696 --> 19:54.819
- I thought it was...

19:54.819 --> 19:56.232
- I mean, I'm sorry.

19:56.232 --> 19:59.080
It's like making an app that has sex

19:59.080 --> 20:00.955
with your girlfriend for you.

20:00.955 --> 20:03.038
- I'd pay for that, yeah.

20:03.882 --> 20:06.019
- I thought I was weird.

20:06.019 --> 20:07.416
- What?

20:07.416 --> 20:10.091
- Do you want to make
friends at this party?

20:10.091 --> 20:11.150
- Well yeah.

20:11.150 --> 20:13.014
- You think this is fedorable?

20:13.014 --> 20:14.224
It's not.

20:14.224 --> 20:16.432
- Hey, that was like 20 bucks.

20:16.432 --> 20:17.744
- Listen, listen.

20:17.744 --> 20:22.077
Dude, go get some beer
and talk to some girls.

20:22.077 --> 20:24.077
- Talk to them about what?

20:24.077 --> 20:26.934
- I don't know, isn't
there an app for that?

20:26.934 --> 20:28.235
- Oh God.

20:28.235 --> 20:32.402
("We'll Get High" by Willie McGee)

21:33.321 --> 21:34.454
- What the hell, man.

21:34.454 --> 21:35.436
What do you think you're doing?

21:35.436 --> 21:37.401
- Can I just pee in peace for one sec--

21:37.401 --> 21:38.271
Hi, um.

21:38.271 --> 21:39.104
I, got.

21:41.366 --> 21:43.058
That this was the pee spot.

21:43.058 --> 21:45.269
- Oh okay, then I'll just
go pee on your house later?

21:45.269 --> 21:46.910
- That's not what I meant,
it's just that's where they--

21:46.910 --> 21:49.163
- You know what, get outta here.

21:49.163 --> 21:50.749
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21:50.749 --> 21:52.473
Ah, it was just number one.

21:52.473 --> 21:53.944
That's all I did.

21:53.944 --> 21:55.944
How do I get outta here?

21:57.468 --> 21:59.218
- Hey man, I'm sorry.

22:00.511 --> 22:02.511
- Okay, I guess I was...

22:03.904 --> 22:05.130
- It was a joke.

22:05.130 --> 22:08.509
- No it's cool, I was just
confused because you kicked

22:08.509 --> 22:11.530
me out with your foot onto my
bottom, so that's why I was--

22:11.530 --> 22:13.402
- (laughs) Your bottom.

22:13.402 --> 22:14.925
- I just thought.

22:14.925 --> 22:16.874
- You know what, I'm sorry.

22:16.874 --> 22:17.904
I'm Lana.

22:17.904 --> 22:19.302
- Kevin, Kevin Cassidy.

22:19.302 --> 22:20.679
- Nice to meet you.

22:20.679 --> 22:21.811
- Nice to meet you too.

22:21.811 --> 22:25.191
- You wanna go back to the party?

22:25.191 --> 22:28.608
(electronic dance music)

22:44.478 --> 22:47.575
- Why don't you get us some beers and try

22:47.575 --> 22:51.075
not to get drugged by the time I get back.

22:54.203 --> 22:56.453
- Hey guys, what's hopping?

22:59.049 --> 23:00.153
- I like him.

23:00.153 --> 23:01.687
- Oh, you're clever.

23:01.687 --> 23:03.084
- Come here.
- Come here.

23:03.084 --> 23:04.036
- Oh, oh okay. Alright.

23:04.036 --> 23:04.869
- What's your name?

23:04.869 --> 23:06.260
- Oh, it's Kevin Cassidy.

23:06.260 --> 23:09.994
Do y'all know where to
find some beers or alcohol?

23:09.994 --> 23:11.517
- Yeah!

23:11.517 --> 23:12.532
Open your mouth.

23:12.532 --> 23:13.617
- Close your eyes.

23:13.617 --> 23:15.516
- Oh no, oh okay you know what?

23:15.516 --> 23:17.718
I think I'll, I'll pass, I'll come back.

23:17.718 --> 23:19.239
Oh don't worry, I'll be there.

23:19.239 --> 23:20.578
Oh yeah.

23:20.578 --> 23:21.578
- Come back.

23:40.395 --> 23:42.075
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

23:42.075 --> 23:45.198
I didn't even see you there.

23:45.198 --> 23:47.211
- Yeah, yeah actually.

23:47.211 --> 23:48.044
Wow.

23:48.972 --> 23:53.413
I don't mean to be rude,
but could I have two?

23:53.413 --> 23:54.246
Thank you.

23:55.198 --> 23:59.365
You know, it is just so
nice to finally be talking

24:00.377 --> 24:02.033
with someone, ya know?

24:02.033 --> 24:04.373
Those people in there are
just a bunch of horn dogs.

24:04.373 --> 24:06.958
- It's a little queer
for my taste, ya know.

24:06.958 --> 24:09.758
Just sissies taking shots, lotta mollie.

24:09.758 --> 24:11.313
- Yeah.

24:11.313 --> 24:13.230
- I'm more a man's man.

24:19.039 --> 24:21.157
Let's go check my bike out.

24:21.157 --> 24:24.173
- Oh well, my friend is over--

24:24.173 --> 24:25.006
What?

24:29.115 --> 24:29.948
I'm sorry.

24:37.336 --> 24:38.169
Lana? Lana!

24:38.169 --> 24:39.008
Lana!

24:39.008 --> 24:40.647
Excuse me, excuse me.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.175
Lana, Lana we need to go now.

24:42.175 --> 24:43.090
We need to leave.

24:43.090 --> 24:43.923
- Whoa, we just got here.

24:43.923 --> 24:45.729
- You don't understand,
you don't understand.

24:45.729 --> 24:46.995
- Where's that little shit at!?

24:46.995 --> 24:48.014
- Right there.

24:48.014 --> 24:49.404
- Oh, okay.

24:49.404 --> 24:51.369
- Let's go, go, go, go.

24:51.369 --> 24:52.996
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:52.996 --> 24:55.271
It seriously looks like someone needs

24:55.271 --> 24:56.836
an attitude adjustment.

24:56.836 --> 24:58.071
- Alright, let's go check my bike.

24:58.071 --> 24:58.904
- Yeah.

25:01.477 --> 25:03.832
(balloon pops)

25:03.832 --> 25:05.099
- Shh.

25:05.099 --> 25:07.932
- What if, what if they have guns?

25:09.987 --> 25:11.790
- Take your shoes off.

25:11.790 --> 25:12.873
- Okay, okay.

25:14.022 --> 25:18.189
♫ Taking off my shoes,
I'm taking off my shoes

25:24.482 --> 25:25.885
- Well don't just stare.

25:25.885 --> 25:27.085
- Oh, I'm sorry.

25:27.085 --> 25:28.418
I'm not looking.

25:31.381 --> 25:32.214
Oh my God!

25:35.006 --> 25:38.339
(upbeat romantic music)

26:51.302 --> 26:52.135
Oh wow.

26:58.056 --> 26:58.934
You got it.

26:58.934 --> 26:59.851
- I got it.

27:02.925 --> 27:03.968
Want some?

27:03.968 --> 27:06.424
- Oh, I don't smoke.

27:06.424 --> 27:07.924
- Really? Why not?

27:09.864 --> 27:11.697
- I have to get a job.

27:13.043 --> 27:15.793
- Dude, my professors smoke weed.

27:18.593 --> 27:19.426
- Alright.

27:22.596 --> 27:24.353
(Kevin coughs)

27:24.353 --> 27:25.521
Nope, that's you.

27:25.521 --> 27:28.964
Oh God, I haven't smoked
since high school.

27:28.964 --> 27:29.797
- Really?

27:31.695 --> 27:33.862
I smoke like everyday now.

27:39.277 --> 27:41.870
I miss smoking back then, though.

27:41.870 --> 27:42.703
- Why?

27:43.677 --> 27:48.179
- I don't know, it was
more ceremonial, I guess.

27:48.179 --> 27:50.315
I'd get all my friends
together and we'd find

27:50.315 --> 27:54.225
a secret spot, try to hide from my parents

27:54.225 --> 27:56.975
so they wouldn't catch us stoned.

28:02.817 --> 28:03.734
It's funny.

28:06.549 --> 28:10.632
Can't even see my parents
without being high now.

28:24.737 --> 28:27.404
- Having a little trouble there?

28:30.100 --> 28:32.120
- You know, I feel like
if I do this art show

28:32.120 --> 28:34.370
and nobody buys anything...

28:36.495 --> 28:38.828
I'm gonna feel like a loser.

28:39.837 --> 28:40.670
- Loser?

28:42.098 --> 28:44.096
What do you even have to lose, hun?

28:44.096 --> 28:45.013
- 50 bucks!

28:45.917 --> 28:47.167
And my dignity.

28:48.452 --> 28:49.874
- Your dignity?

28:49.874 --> 28:53.710
Your dignity went out the
window a long time ago, hun.

28:53.710 --> 28:55.859
Besides, what if people
see it and they think

28:55.859 --> 28:57.288
it's like the best
thing they've ever seen.

28:57.288 --> 28:59.001
- Or what if I stand there like a goober

28:59.001 --> 29:01.526
at the mall selling handbags?

29:01.526 --> 29:03.961
- When did you get so self-conscious?

29:03.961 --> 29:07.497
Did that awkward boy rub
off on you all night?

29:07.497 --> 29:08.330
- No.

29:09.575 --> 29:10.408
- Why not?

29:12.745 --> 29:15.162
(rock music)

29:17.229 --> 29:19.979
(water splashes)

29:25.322 --> 29:28.200
- So you've been waiting
tables for three years?

29:28.200 --> 29:31.682
- So you've been a bar
back for three years?

29:31.682 --> 29:33.380
- Is this scented?

29:33.380 --> 29:35.297
- Listen, I am fashion.

29:54.916 --> 29:58.503
♫ Oh baby, what you gonna do

29:58.503 --> 30:01.522
♫ When your man gon' come through

30:01.522 --> 30:04.662
♫ Oh baby what you gonna say

30:04.662 --> 30:07.961

30:15.181 --> 30:18.294
♫ Ooo baby what you tryin' get

30:18.294 --> 30:21.605
♫ 'Bout what your man did

30:21.605 --> 30:24.790
♫ Ooo baby what you tryin' get

30:24.790 --> 30:28.196
♫ About what your man did

30:28.196 --> 30:30.260
♫ Ooo baby what you gonna do

30:30.260 --> 30:32.007
♫ When your man

30:32.007 --> 30:35.174
♫ Gonna get outta bed

30:49.852 --> 30:50.856
- What's this?

30:50.856 --> 30:53.113
- Oh, that's my resume.

30:53.113 --> 30:53.946
- Thanks.

30:57.546 --> 30:59.657
Do I know you from somewhere?

30:59.657 --> 31:01.878
- I don't think so.

31:01.878 --> 31:03.128
- Ah, whatever.

31:03.993 --> 31:06.516
Okay, why do you wanna work here?

31:06.516 --> 31:08.183
- Well I need a job.

31:09.796 --> 31:12.951
I really, really need a job.

31:12.951 --> 31:16.391
- God, I just thought you
had a love of mac and cheese.

31:16.391 --> 31:18.713
- I thought this was a pizza place.

31:18.713 --> 31:20.963
- Honey, all things cheese.

31:22.752 --> 31:25.347
Have you ever worked in
a food trailer before?

31:25.347 --> 31:26.847
- Yes, yes I have.

31:31.892 --> 31:33.745
No, no I haven't.

31:33.745 --> 31:35.084
- You're hired.

31:35.084 --> 31:36.010
- What!?

31:36.010 --> 31:36.880
- Yep.

31:36.880 --> 31:37.713
- Wait...

31:38.650 --> 31:39.483
Oh, wow.

31:41.232 --> 31:42.065
- Wow.

31:42.065 --> 31:43.901
- That is amazing.

31:43.901 --> 31:46.131
You just don't know what I've been through

31:46.131 --> 31:47.091
trying to get a job.

31:47.091 --> 31:48.425
It's really hard to get one here.

31:48.425 --> 31:50.989
- You have to have some
skills here, to work here.

31:50.989 --> 31:52.608
- Oh, I'll do anything.

31:52.608 --> 31:55.672
- Half a brain, maybe one ball.

31:55.672 --> 31:58.015
- Remember the time we saw
George Bush at the party?

31:58.015 --> 32:00.173
He was wasted, man.

32:00.173 --> 32:03.068
Have you ever had sex with a kangaroo?

32:03.068 --> 32:04.452
- Um...

32:04.452 --> 32:05.769
Not yet.

32:05.769 --> 32:07.585
What is that, where did you get that?

32:07.585 --> 32:09.388
- I dunno, found it last
night on the street.

32:09.388 --> 32:10.668
- Six pockets.

32:10.668 --> 32:11.866
- Nice tits though, eh.

32:11.866 --> 32:14.166
- I definitely got laid, I think?

32:14.166 --> 32:15.489
- You didn't get laid, man.

32:15.489 --> 32:16.728
- No, I definitely got laid, I think.

32:16.728 --> 32:17.604
- That's not true.

32:17.604 --> 32:18.437
- Like--

32:18.437 --> 32:19.270
- What?

32:19.270 --> 32:20.103
- Like I helped.

32:20.103 --> 32:21.363
- This sheila I helped Friday night?

32:21.363 --> 32:23.954
- Hey guys, guess who just got a new job?

32:23.954 --> 32:25.238
- Oh that's sick, man.

32:25.238 --> 32:26.071
- Yeah.

32:26.071 --> 32:27.073
Wanna go like swimming or something?

32:27.073 --> 32:30.314
- Oh, we're heading back to the island.

32:30.314 --> 32:31.744
- What the hell am I supposed to do?

32:31.744 --> 32:33.433
Like who am I supposed
to hang out with now?

32:33.433 --> 32:34.728
- Really, man?

32:34.728 --> 32:36.693
This is like the easiest
place in the world

32:36.693 --> 32:39.146
to meet people, just go talk to someone.

32:39.146 --> 32:40.698
- [Dude] I was delivering
this guy like a sack

32:40.698 --> 32:42.399
of oranges right?
(Kevin laughs)

32:42.399 --> 32:44.839
No seriously, this is a true story.

32:44.839 --> 32:46.699
- Wow, dude nice throw.

32:46.699 --> 32:47.832
That was good.

32:47.832 --> 32:48.779
Yeah.

32:48.779 --> 32:51.949
- That disk is warped,
anyways like I was saying,

32:51.949 --> 32:53.895
I had the win, I had the win at the 2012

32:53.895 --> 32:55.953
International Invitational but uh,

32:55.953 --> 32:58.756
you know, I broke my back
while I was spelunking,

32:58.756 --> 33:01.186
so my mom wouldn't let me go.

33:01.186 --> 33:02.447
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

33:02.447 --> 33:03.280
- Oh no, that's cool bro.

33:03.280 --> 33:04.432
I got lots of stuff going on.

33:04.432 --> 33:07.907
I got my delivery service,
I've got these lessons,

33:07.907 --> 33:09.488
these pay pretty well.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.086
I got lots of stuff going on.

33:11.086 --> 33:13.568
I got lots of things.
- What do you deliver?

33:13.568 --> 33:14.587
- What was that?

33:14.587 --> 33:15.504
- Oh, yeah.

33:16.529 --> 33:17.686
What do you deliver?

33:17.686 --> 33:19.439
- Oh you know, just like anything.

33:19.439 --> 33:21.142
Anything you need, like we can go get it.

33:21.142 --> 33:22.305
- Literally anything?

33:22.305 --> 33:23.686
- Yeah, yeah totally bro.

33:23.686 --> 33:25.836
Like what do you want, what do you need?

33:25.836 --> 33:27.097
- I need to poop.

33:27.097 --> 33:28.865
- Oh, you got a case of the gurglies bro?

33:28.865 --> 33:30.982
I got something that'll cure it, dude.

33:30.982 --> 33:32.704
It's in my back pocket, right here.

33:32.704 --> 33:33.817
- Oh no, uh.

33:33.817 --> 33:35.116
- Oh really?

33:35.116 --> 33:37.446
Okay, well you know the
porta potties are back

33:37.446 --> 33:39.724
in the very front, but
there's a better spot.

33:39.724 --> 33:41.606
If you take the trail, alright?

33:41.606 --> 33:44.182
Back over past hole five, and you get into

33:44.182 --> 33:46.740
the thicket behind the
trees, you can right there

33:46.740 --> 33:49.025
and there's plenty of nice
big leaves for you to use.

33:49.025 --> 33:51.001
- I don't need the imagery, I just to know

33:51.001 --> 33:52.580
where it's gonna be.

33:52.580 --> 33:53.995
- Yeah, but watch out
'cause lots of joggers

33:53.995 --> 33:55.926
come by and they got dogs
and they can smell that shit.

33:55.926 --> 33:58.246
- I'm just gonna go find
it, I'm just gonna go find.

33:58.246 --> 34:00.329
- Alright, good luck bro!

34:16.437 --> 34:18.146
(Shea screams)

34:18.146 --> 34:19.346
- Oh no, it's me Kevin.

34:19.346 --> 34:20.775
I'm from the cab.

34:20.775 --> 34:22.597
I'm here to sell--

34:22.597 --> 34:23.442
- Sell your app.

34:23.442 --> 34:25.282
- To sell my app, exactly.

34:25.282 --> 34:27.341
- What're you doing
hiding in the grass for?

34:27.341 --> 34:29.411
- For uh, for uh, the app.

34:29.411 --> 34:32.889
You know, we're doing our
target audience, yeah.

34:32.889 --> 34:34.702
- I'm your target audience?

34:34.702 --> 34:37.333
- No, not you specifically.

34:37.333 --> 34:40.806
We're just looking for
attractive girls in general.

34:40.806 --> 34:42.900
- So you think I'm attractive?

34:42.900 --> 34:44.553
- No, no, no, no.

34:44.553 --> 34:47.241
We're just looking for a
girl for our ad campaign

34:47.241 --> 34:51.481
and that would be, preferably,
someone attractive.

34:51.481 --> 34:52.981
- So like a model?

34:54.897 --> 34:55.980
- Yeah, yeah.

34:58.236 --> 35:00.460
- I did modeling in high school.

35:00.460 --> 35:02.094
It was just for graduation photos,

35:02.094 --> 35:03.904
but I still modeled.

35:03.904 --> 35:05.013
- Huh.

35:05.013 --> 35:06.933
- You can use me if you want.

35:06.933 --> 35:08.258
- Really?

35:08.258 --> 35:10.397
- My profile pic has like 200 likes.

35:10.397 --> 35:12.376
It's not a big deal.

35:12.376 --> 35:15.451
- Alright, well how do I contact you?

35:15.451 --> 35:17.201
- Give me your phone.

35:19.988 --> 35:22.097
- So call you later?

35:22.097 --> 35:25.581
- Um, I'm busy tonight
but maybe we could go

35:25.581 --> 35:27.268
grab drinks tomorrow?

35:27.268 --> 35:28.351
- Definitely.

35:31.072 --> 35:32.322
- Are you okay?

35:33.850 --> 35:34.683
- Golden.

35:35.678 --> 35:36.511
100%.

35:37.509 --> 35:40.104
- I guess I'm gonna go now.

35:40.104 --> 35:41.362
- Yeah, totally.

35:41.362 --> 35:42.744
Yeah you just, um.

35:42.744 --> 35:45.577
You just keep on, keep on jogging.

35:46.466 --> 35:48.664
Jog away, like a,

35:48.664 --> 35:49.831
like a jogger.

35:51.366 --> 35:52.366
- Okay? Bye.

35:54.618 --> 35:55.451
- Cya.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.667
- Kate, Kate please.

35:59.501 --> 36:00.334
Please!

36:01.779 --> 36:04.521
- Kevin, I can't give you an advance.

36:04.521 --> 36:05.739
- Why not?

36:05.739 --> 36:08.780
- Oh, well for one, you
worked like 30 minutes.

36:08.780 --> 36:11.126
(Kevin groans)

36:11.126 --> 36:14.293
- There's gotta be something I can do.

36:15.461 --> 36:17.544
- You want to make money?

36:19.177 --> 36:20.997
- Well how would I do that?

36:20.997 --> 36:23.664
(ominous music)

36:28.366 --> 36:30.449
(knocks)

36:39.140 --> 36:39.973
No.

36:51.625 --> 36:53.278
- Hello?

36:53.278 --> 36:54.380
- Are you Linda?

36:54.380 --> 36:55.221
- Yeah, you're--

36:55.221 --> 36:57.664
- You don't need to know my name, okay?

36:57.664 --> 37:00.405
- It's Kevin, Kate told
me you were coming.

37:00.405 --> 37:01.238
- Dammit!

37:02.756 --> 37:04.376
Well do you have the money?

37:04.376 --> 37:07.107
- Yeah, it's in my pocket.

37:07.107 --> 37:09.239
- Mom, I'm going outside.

37:09.239 --> 37:11.076
- Stay out of the street.

37:11.076 --> 37:12.380
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, no.

37:12.380 --> 37:14.514
I am not dealing drugs to a parent, okay?

37:14.514 --> 37:15.898
That is just irresponsible.

37:15.898 --> 37:17.699
Kevin, it's pot. Relax.

37:17.699 --> 37:20.196
- What if the FBI is
listening to me right now?

37:20.196 --> 37:21.761
I'm done, I'm screwed.

37:21.761 --> 37:22.895
- Uh, Kevin.

37:22.895 --> 37:24.503
- I don't wanna be caught by the police

37:24.503 --> 37:27.313
and go to prison for life, okay?

37:27.313 --> 37:29.396
That's what they all say.

37:30.464 --> 37:32.954
- Oh yellow, good choice.

37:32.954 --> 37:34.727
- Bye Kevin!

37:34.727 --> 37:36.167
Thanks for the pot.

37:36.167 --> 37:37.572
- Stop saying my name.

37:37.572 --> 37:39.061
- Ah, shit.

37:39.061 --> 37:40.031
- Bye Kevin!

37:40.031 --> 37:42.010
- Stop saying my name, okay?

37:42.010 --> 37:44.570
It's not Kevin Cassidy,
it's George Palitroni.

37:44.570 --> 37:45.668
- Come back and see us seen.

37:45.668 --> 37:48.070
- You never saw me, you never saw me.

37:48.070 --> 37:49.586
- Bye Kevin!

37:49.586 --> 37:50.886
- Stop it, stop it!

37:50.886 --> 37:52.567
Go back to your mother.

37:52.567 --> 37:55.232
I'm never, ever doing that again.

37:55.232 --> 37:57.357
Okay? It's not happening.

37:57.357 --> 37:59.551
- Why, did she hit on you?

37:59.551 --> 38:00.881
- What? No, no.

38:00.881 --> 38:05.490
I'm just really uncomfortable
with selling drugs, okay?

38:05.490 --> 38:07.692
I ripped my shirt, too.

38:07.692 --> 38:09.932
- You know it's actually
kinda coming back into style,

38:09.932 --> 38:11.671
you can probably sell it.

38:11.671 --> 38:12.730
- Really?

38:12.730 --> 38:14.381
- Yeah.

38:14.381 --> 38:15.983
- Huh.

38:15.983 --> 38:16.816
Cool.

38:17.751 --> 38:19.148
You know what?

38:19.148 --> 38:20.398
You're a saint.

38:23.054 --> 38:25.304
- That's what they call me.

38:29.590 --> 38:31.300
- This guy again?

38:31.300 --> 38:33.249
Somebody get the fire extinguisher,

38:33.249 --> 38:34.770
we're gonna need it.

38:34.770 --> 38:38.937
("Let's Talk About the
Heat" by Willie McGee)

39:59.465 --> 40:02.298
- Hey girl, it's your best friend.

40:03.360 --> 40:06.682
His name is Kevin Cassidy
and he's about to take

40:06.682 --> 40:08.327
you on a date.

40:08.327 --> 40:09.160
Yeah, I'm sorry.

40:09.160 --> 40:10.827
I'll be right there.

40:12.808 --> 40:16.155
Alright, I got my caulk,
I got my peanut butter,

40:16.155 --> 40:19.491
I got my dollar, I got my
recorder, and I got a sock.

40:19.491 --> 40:21.824
How fun, a sock and a caulk.

40:22.832 --> 40:25.171
(jazzy piano)

40:25.171 --> 40:26.830
- Oh my gosh, these scallops are like

40:26.830 --> 40:28.747
the best scallops ever.

40:29.613 --> 40:32.995
- Yeah, I just wish I
wasn't allergic to seafood.

40:32.995 --> 40:36.068
- You should've told me, we
could've gone somewhere else.

40:36.068 --> 40:38.352
- We could go to like get fast food

40:38.352 --> 40:40.355
and just eat it really slow.

40:40.355 --> 40:41.855
- That's so funny.

40:45.369 --> 40:48.343
- Hello, how are we doing this evening?

40:48.343 --> 40:49.529
- [Kevin] Very good.

40:49.529 --> 40:52.533
- That's fine, how are you?

40:52.533 --> 40:53.507
- Good.

40:53.507 --> 40:56.432
- Excellent, what can I get for you?

40:56.432 --> 40:58.773
- Oh, I'll just have water.

40:58.773 --> 41:00.055
- I'm sorry.

41:00.055 --> 41:02.548
- What would you suggest for the Pinot?

41:02.548 --> 41:04.754
- What's really expensive.

41:04.754 --> 41:06.053
- Perfect.

41:06.053 --> 41:09.417
- I just, I think we just
need a minute, you know,

41:09.417 --> 41:11.359
get some more time.

41:11.359 --> 41:12.359
- Fràn Sois.

41:14.472 --> 41:17.289
- Great, there were two
options and he chose

41:17.289 --> 41:20.313
the most expensive one, so...

41:20.313 --> 41:21.396
Oh wow. Okay.

41:22.604 --> 41:24.969
It just gets worse as you turn the page.

41:24.969 --> 41:28.052
So the way I started my app was uh...

41:29.034 --> 41:32.652
Well, I don't really
tell many people this,

41:32.652 --> 41:35.069
but sometimes I doubt myself.

41:36.872 --> 41:38.400
I don't really know who I am.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.150
I guess I'm insecure.

41:41.836 --> 41:44.111
- Oh my God, look at this text.

41:44.111 --> 41:46.751
- I'm actually really glad
you weren't listening to that.

41:46.751 --> 41:48.501
- Hold on one second.

41:51.051 --> 41:52.134
You wanna go?

41:54.474 --> 41:55.932
- Yeah, sure.

41:55.932 --> 41:57.497
Sounds great.

41:57.497 --> 41:59.247
- I'll be right back.

42:01.016 --> 42:01.849
- Okay.

42:07.199 --> 42:08.032
- So...

42:11.861 --> 42:14.750
- Uh, you know I wanted
to talk to you about this.

42:14.750 --> 42:16.500
I didn't want to say
this while she was here,

42:16.500 --> 42:19.837
but there was actually a bug in my food.

42:19.837 --> 42:21.237
I mean...

42:21.237 --> 42:22.070
- A bug?

42:23.169 --> 42:25.214
- I just thought this
establishment was better

42:25.214 --> 42:28.397
than to have bugs in their food.

42:28.397 --> 42:29.917
- Okay.

42:29.917 --> 42:31.374
What dish?

42:31.374 --> 42:34.099
- Oh well, actually the wine.

42:34.099 --> 42:36.149
He was just swimming in here.

42:36.149 --> 42:39.816
He's like the next
Michael Phelps, but uh...

42:40.810 --> 42:43.127
- You're still gonna have
to pay for everything else.

42:43.127 --> 42:45.332
- Oh here it is, just go crazy with it.

42:45.332 --> 42:46.930
Just put that right there.

42:46.930 --> 42:47.763
- There you go.

42:47.763 --> 42:48.596
Alright.

42:48.596 --> 42:50.442
- Thank you so much.

42:50.442 --> 42:51.275
Alrighty.

42:53.388 --> 42:54.471
I'm gonna go.

42:55.592 --> 42:56.425
Oh shit!

42:59.604 --> 43:00.621
Alright, let's get outta here.

43:00.621 --> 43:01.454
Come on, come on, come on.

43:01.454 --> 43:02.423
Alrighty, we're having come.

43:02.423 --> 43:03.711
Okay, let's go, let's go.

43:03.711 --> 43:05.028
- Do you want to hail a cab or?

43:05.028 --> 43:09.128
- We should probably just walk, let's go.

43:09.128 --> 43:10.323
- No!

43:10.323 --> 43:13.288
Dammit, not in my section!

43:13.288 --> 43:16.621
(deep electronic music)

43:22.829 --> 43:24.792
- Wow, so this is your place?

43:24.792 --> 43:26.328
- Yeah.

43:26.328 --> 43:28.362
You can make yourself cozy,

43:28.362 --> 43:30.427
I'm gonna go get more comfortable.

43:30.427 --> 43:31.260
- Okay.

43:38.313 --> 43:39.646
That's terrible.

43:42.044 --> 43:43.794
Oh, that's so stupid.

43:47.948 --> 43:48.865
- Oh Kevin?

43:57.868 --> 43:59.285
Are you sleeping?

44:02.169 --> 44:05.502
(deep electronic music)

44:06.565 --> 44:07.398
- Wow.

44:11.527 --> 44:12.360
Oh, wow.

44:27.084 --> 44:27.917
- Kevin?

44:31.665 --> 44:32.668
Kevin!

44:32.668 --> 44:34.387
- Ah, that tickles.

44:34.387 --> 44:36.799
Got me right on my tickle spot.

44:36.799 --> 44:39.064
- What's wrong with you?

44:39.064 --> 44:41.425
Why are you all dazed and confused?

44:41.425 --> 44:42.627
- What?

44:42.627 --> 44:44.251
What're you talking about?

44:44.251 --> 44:46.731
- Please, you look like
you're on cloud nine.

44:46.731 --> 44:48.389
Are you high?

44:48.389 --> 44:51.429
- No, no, I don't do that stuff.

44:51.429 --> 44:53.029
You know I don't.

44:53.029 --> 44:54.789
That's gross.

44:54.789 --> 44:57.406
- Okay, well you can if you want to,

44:57.406 --> 44:59.083
I don't need you here today.

44:59.083 --> 45:00.549
- Come on, okay, okay.

45:00.549 --> 45:01.561
I'm awake, I'm awake.

45:01.561 --> 45:03.861
I'm not dazed and confused anymore.

45:03.861 --> 45:06.184
- That's fine, I still
don't need you here today,

45:06.184 --> 45:08.229
we haven't had a customer
in like three hours.

45:08.229 --> 45:10.008
- Well where am I supposed to go?

45:10.008 --> 45:11.726
I don't wanna go back to
the hostel, it's boring

45:11.726 --> 45:14.133
and just really, really, dirty there.

45:14.133 --> 45:15.632
- Kevin why don't you stop asking people

45:15.632 --> 45:17.916
what to do and just follow your gut.

45:17.916 --> 45:19.473
- Follow my gut?

45:19.473 --> 45:21.906
What does that even mean?

45:21.906 --> 45:23.831
Am I supposed to follow my gut and just go

45:23.831 --> 45:26.135
wherever I want to go and
turn left, turn right?

45:26.135 --> 45:27.530
I mean so if my gut tells me to just walk

45:27.530 --> 45:31.852
all the way to Wisconsin,
I'm supposed to do that?

45:31.852 --> 45:33.121
- Yes Kevin.

45:33.121 --> 45:35.195
If your gut tells you
to walk to Wisconsin,

45:35.195 --> 45:36.598
walk to Wisconsin.

45:36.598 --> 45:38.920
If your gut tells you to walk on a table,

45:38.920 --> 45:40.230
walk a table.

45:40.230 --> 45:41.415
- Hey, get off the table--

45:41.415 --> 45:43.130
- If your gut tells you
to poke your employee.

45:43.130 --> 45:43.963
Like this?

45:43.963 --> 45:45.486
Is it dirty like my broom?
- You don't know where

45:45.486 --> 45:46.319
that's been, it's been in
- Is that dirty?

45:46.319 --> 45:47.180
- Dirty places.

45:47.180 --> 45:48.921
- I know exactly where it's been, Kevin.

45:48.921 --> 45:51.252
Go to Wisconsin, Kevin!

45:51.252 --> 45:52.686
God!

46:26.142 --> 46:29.664

46:29.664 --> 46:30.701
- Oh sir, sir.

46:30.701 --> 46:33.644
I'm so sorry
- Step in a landmine?

46:33.644 --> 46:36.442
Come on over and sit
down, clean your boot off.

46:36.442 --> 46:39.708
- Okay, I'm just, I feel terrible.

46:39.708 --> 46:41.163
I'm so sorry, I just--

46:41.163 --> 46:42.924
- Oh that's alright.

46:42.924 --> 46:45.221
Nice view from here.

46:45.221 --> 46:48.023
Me and my wife used to sit out here

46:48.023 --> 46:49.773
and talk about, uh...

46:51.900 --> 46:53.567
Well hell, I forgot.

46:55.278 --> 46:57.236
Where you heading?

46:57.236 --> 46:58.736
- Nowhere, really.

46:59.793 --> 47:03.617
- Well, you're always heading some place.

47:03.617 --> 47:06.302
You just may not know where it is.

47:06.302 --> 47:07.469
Yeah, the key,

47:10.302 --> 47:12.135
is to keep on walking.

47:14.955 --> 47:19.240
- You know I have this one girl,
and she's kinda terrifying,

47:19.240 --> 47:22.833
to be honest, but I feel
like I'm in quicksand.

47:22.833 --> 47:24.475
- You honest with her?

47:24.475 --> 47:25.838
- No.

47:25.838 --> 47:30.339
- You gotta show her your rough
side and your good side too.

47:30.339 --> 47:32.497
But you're walking, huh?

47:32.497 --> 47:35.414
Come on, let me show you something.

47:37.743 --> 47:38.743
There it is.

47:39.777 --> 47:40.775
- Wow.

47:40.775 --> 47:41.999
- That's yours, son.

47:41.999 --> 47:42.978
- Sir, no, no.

47:42.978 --> 47:44.192
- No, no, go and take.

47:44.192 --> 47:45.503
- I can't take your bike from you.

47:45.503 --> 47:47.474
- No, this beats walking.

47:47.474 --> 47:49.493
It ain't a beauty, but it'll work.

47:49.493 --> 47:52.463
Never had no children to give it to.

47:52.463 --> 47:54.079
Go ahead and take it.

47:54.079 --> 47:55.995
That's what it's for.

47:55.995 --> 47:57.759
Somebody who needs it.

47:57.759 --> 47:59.538
Yeah, that'll get you there.

47:59.538 --> 48:00.788
Take care, son.

49:14.233 --> 49:15.976

49:15.976 --> 49:17.193
So hanging out.

49:17.193 --> 49:18.536
- Is that your shirt?

49:18.536 --> 49:19.750
- Yeah, yeah.

- Can I use it?

49:20.877 --> 49:21.710
- Sure.

- Yeah. Are you?

49:29.656 --> 49:32.406
- Yeah, I come here all the time.

49:35.307 --> 49:37.409

character, or something.

49:44.928 --> 49:46.652
- He's an attorney.

- That's cool, I guess.

49:49.963 --> 49:51.380
- What about you?

49:52.478 --> 49:53.606
- What about me?

49:53.606 --> 49:55.752
- What do you do?

49:55.752 --> 49:57.835
- That's a good question.

50:00.605 --> 50:02.772
I guess sometimes I paint.

50:04.066 --> 50:05.303
- You paint?

50:05.303 --> 50:06.649
- Yeah.

50:06.649 --> 50:08.247
- That's so cool.

50:08.247 --> 50:09.156
You know what?

50:09.156 --> 50:11.287
I wish I could paint, but
the only thing I'm good for

50:11.287 --> 50:12.688
is coding stupid apps.

50:12.688 --> 50:14.951
- Well at least apps are worth something.

50:14.951 --> 50:19.184
- Now I bet your paintings
are worth like a bajillion

50:19.184 --> 50:21.365
dollars, that's how much I'd buy it for.

50:21.365 --> 50:23.249

you never even seen 'em.

left without saying good-bye.

50:42.127 --> 50:43.025
- Mom, mom.

50:43.025 --> 50:44.911
- I was worried you might
be in a ditch somewhere.

50:44.911 --> 50:46.190
- Mom, mom everything's fine.

50:48.351 --> 50:50.967
- God, I thought you were dead.

50:50.967 --> 50:53.384
- Mom, I'm gonna do it, okay?

50:54.310 --> 50:57.030
I'm gonna sell our app, I'm
gonna buy us a new home.

50:57.030 --> 50:59.010
- Well, as long as it has wheels.

50:59.010 --> 51:01.414
Is Tyler letting you stay with him.

51:01.414 --> 51:05.145
- No, I'm actually living in a hostel.

belly flop over there,

51:14.279 --> 51:15.335
it was sick.

51:15.335 --> 51:16.695
What you been up to?

51:16.695 --> 51:18.695
- Oh, you know. School.

51:18.695 --> 51:21.617
- Word, I've just been skating a ton,

51:21.617 --> 51:22.952
just living it up.

51:22.952 --> 51:24.417
I dunno, Austin's sick.

51:24.417 --> 51:25.450
Yeah, yeah.

51:25.450 --> 51:27.279
- Have you been out a lot?

51:27.279 --> 51:29.039
- Yeah, I've been partying a lot.

51:29.039 --> 51:30.239
Like a lot, a lot.

51:30.239 --> 51:32.620
- Yeah?
- A lot, a lot.

51:32.620 --> 51:35.297
- Well maybe I'll like, see
you around at some parties.

51:35.297 --> 51:37.323
- I hope so, I haven't
been seeing you around.

51:37.323 --> 51:38.935
- Yeah, it's a been a while.

51:38.935 --> 51:39.768
I've been kinda busy.

- Word, word.

Keeping busy.

51:42.471 --> 51:43.304
- Yeah.

51:47.868 --> 51:49.228
I'm free.

51:49.228 --> 51:50.886
I'll be right over, okay.

51:50.886 --> 51:51.719
Cool.

- You know, I'm actually
here with a friend,

52:00.277 --> 52:01.890
so I should probably go.

52:01.890 --> 52:04.223
- Yeah no worries, whatever.

52:07.672 --> 52:09.077
- Yeah you know, I'm really little,

52:09.077 --> 52:10.528
but I can eat a lot.

52:10.528 --> 52:11.685
- Oh perfect, perfect.

52:11.685 --> 52:12.973
- I can drink a lot too.

52:12.973 --> 52:15.077
I don't know, I can drink wine like water.

52:15.077 --> 52:16.494

52:21.531 --> 52:22.909

52:22.909 --> 52:23.742

That is...

52:28.362 --> 52:29.862
That is very nice.

52:32.594 --> 52:34.914
- We're gonna go to my dad's.

52:34.914 --> 52:36.592
He's out of town for
the weekend, so we have

52:36.592 --> 52:38.089
the place to ourselves.

52:38.089 --> 52:39.517
That's okay with you, right?

52:39.517 --> 52:40.350
- S'yeah.

52:41.213 --> 52:42.046
Totally.

52:50.469 --> 52:51.650
Wow.

52:51.650 --> 52:53.817
This place is really nice.

52:55.490 --> 52:56.368
What does your dad do?

52:56.368 --> 52:57.831

- I was, just got back.

53:20.498 --> 53:21.844
- Are you going somewhere?

- No, no, my company develops apps.

53:41.945 --> 53:43.281

- Really?

53:53.559 --> 53:54.698
- It's genius.

53:54.698 --> 53:56.377
- Oh my God, thank you so much.

53:56.377 --> 53:58.607
- It's a shame you already sold the idea.

53:58.607 --> 54:00.857
- Well, I actually haven't.

54:03.078 --> 54:04.667
- But I thought that Shea said--

54:04.667 --> 54:07.627
- Yeah, honestly I just told her that

54:07.627 --> 54:09.206
to think I was successful.

54:09.206 --> 54:10.526
- Alright, listen son.

I don't wanna hear about
you lying to my daughter,

54:12.698 --> 54:14.646
but I am interested in your idea.

54:14.646 --> 54:16.799
You mind if I keep this?

54:16.799 --> 54:20.151
- Well that's the only hard drive I have.

54:20.151 --> 54:22.071
- Kevin, I can show
this to a lot of people.

54:22.071 --> 54:24.508
I'm about to go meet investors right now.

54:24.508 --> 54:26.188
Don't you want a lot
of people to see this?

54:26.188 --> 54:28.771
Don't you wanna sell your idea?

54:29.685 --> 54:30.966
- Yeah, yeah.

54:30.966 --> 54:31.799
You know what?

54:31.799 --> 54:33.443
You go it, you just hang onto it.

54:33.443 --> 54:34.886
- Daddy, your car's ready.

54:34.886 --> 54:36.827
- I gotta go, we'll be in touch.

54:36.827 --> 54:38.607
- Alright, great.

54:38.607 --> 54:39.440
- Bye.

54:48.224 --> 54:49.403
So...

54:49.403 --> 54:51.570
What do you wanna do, Kev?

54:53.436 --> 54:54.269
- Well...

54:59.528 --> 55:00.861
Good job, buddy.

55:19.768 --> 55:22.469
- I'm gonna hop in the
shower, you can go swim

55:22.469 --> 55:25.552
in the pool if you want to rinse off.

55:28.340 --> 55:29.173
- Alright.

55:38.852 --> 55:40.132
- Okay, get out.

55:40.132 --> 55:41.502
- Okay?

55:41.502 --> 55:44.367

- So what did you get your
undergraduate degree in?

56:28.607 --> 56:29.665
- Political science.

56:29.665 --> 56:31.328
I wasn't really sure
what to do so I did that.

56:31.328 --> 56:32.451
- Yeah?

56:32.451 --> 56:33.811
Well that's cool.

56:33.811 --> 56:35.144
- I'm coming up.

56:38.744 --> 56:40.315
Be there soon.

56:40.315 --> 56:42.149
- Wait, is he waving at you?

56:42.149 --> 56:43.509
- Yeah.

56:43.509 --> 56:45.647
I know that guy.

56:45.647 --> 56:47.327
- What? How?

56:47.327 --> 56:50.223
- I met him at a party a few days ago.

56:50.223 --> 56:52.359
- Whoo, I can feel it in my thighs.

56:52.359 --> 56:54.623
I can feel it in my thighs.

56:54.623 --> 56:56.315
I'm a coming, don't you worry.

56:56.315 --> 56:58.484
- But he is, he's a sweetheart.

56:58.484 --> 56:59.678
- [Kevin] I like your dress.

56:59.678 --> 57:01.642
- I trust you, but good luck with that.

57:01.642 --> 57:02.559
I gotta go.

57:06.277 --> 57:07.786
- I'm right over here.

57:07.786 --> 57:08.906
Hi, hi.

57:08.906 --> 57:12.156
If you had some water, that'd be great.

57:13.481 --> 57:15.980
Get ready for some big
thighs when I get there.

57:15.980 --> 57:16.813
Hey, Lana.

57:19.497 --> 57:21.487
How's it going?

57:21.487 --> 57:23.559
- What're following me?

57:23.559 --> 57:24.621
- No! No!

57:24.621 --> 57:27.499
I mean, uh, yeah, but uh.

57:27.499 --> 57:30.184
I was just riding around and, I dunno,

57:30.184 --> 57:32.016
what, what're you doing?

57:32.016 --> 57:33.214
- Just cruising.

57:33.214 --> 57:35.064
- Oh, cruisin' for a brusin'?

57:35.064 --> 57:36.976
- Good one, Kevin.

57:36.976 --> 57:38.809
- Where are you going?

57:39.684 --> 57:41.760
- Think you can keep up?

57:41.760 --> 57:45.260
("Colors" by Eric Burton)

58:37.407 --> 58:39.605
- This is incredible.

58:39.605 --> 58:40.438
- Yeah.

58:42.271 --> 58:46.068
- You know, one day I'm
gonna buy a huge house

58:46.068 --> 58:48.363
that has a view just like this.

58:48.363 --> 58:50.113
- What if you didn't?

58:51.611 --> 58:53.488
- What do you mean?

58:53.488 --> 58:57.131
- Imagine never getting the big house.

58:57.131 --> 59:00.387
How would your life be any different?

59:00.387 --> 59:02.707
- I dunno, I mean I'd feel like a failure.

59:02.707 --> 59:04.563
- Failure to who?

59:04.563 --> 59:07.886
- To myself, to the people I care about.

59:07.886 --> 59:10.608
- Is that what you
think people care about?

59:10.608 --> 59:12.822
Mansions and pet tigers?

59:12.822 --> 59:14.072
Jet skis and...

59:15.851 --> 59:18.351
What do you care about, Kevin?

59:29.728 --> 59:33.811
("In the Summer" by Jordan Hull)

59:50.815 --> 59:51.648
Kevin, no!

59:51.648 --> 59:52.481
Oh my God, stop it!

59:52.481 --> 59:53.314
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

59:53.314 --> 59:54.325
- Oh no (yells).

59:54.325 --> 59:55.548
- Oh, hold on.

59:55.548 --> 59:57.025
You need me to move?

59:57.025 --> 59:58.025
Where is it?

59:59.693 --> 01:00:00.526
Umm.

01:00:04.174 --> 01:00:06.253
- Come sit with me.

01:00:06.253 --> 01:00:09.243
- So did you let Lana paint you naked?

01:00:09.243 --> 01:00:10.365
- Funny.

01:00:10.365 --> 01:00:14.078
- You know she's my best friend, right?

01:00:14.078 --> 01:00:17.617
You mess it up with here
and you're out of a job.

01:00:17.617 --> 01:00:19.283
And I'll kick your ass.

01:00:19.283 --> 01:00:21.783
There's that.
- Hey, hey relax.

01:00:22.991 --> 01:00:25.241
I really, really like Lana.

01:00:27.096 --> 01:00:30.164
And besides, I'm helping
with her art show tomorrow.

01:00:30.164 --> 01:00:31.180
- She's gonna do it?

01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:32.341
- Mm-hmm.

01:00:32.341 --> 01:00:34.354
- You must've said something right,

01:00:34.354 --> 01:00:36.806
I could never get her to do anything.

01:00:36.806 --> 01:00:39.228
I'll let you off early from Pitch Fest.

01:00:39.228 --> 01:00:40.543
- What is that thing anyways?

01:00:40.543 --> 01:00:42.423
I feel like there's a
festival every week in here.

01:00:42.423 --> 01:00:44.428
- Well this one is
basically a bunch of nerds

01:00:44.428 --> 01:00:46.678
like you trying to sell
their souls to developers.

01:00:46.678 --> 01:00:48.201
It's actually pretty entertaining.

01:00:48.201 --> 01:00:51.228
Some people have some really bad ideas.

01:00:51.228 --> 01:00:52.478
- I bet, I bet.

01:00:54.759 --> 01:00:57.124
- Anyway yeah, I'll let you off early.

01:00:57.124 --> 01:00:58.554
- Cool, cool.

01:00:58.554 --> 01:00:59.971
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:01.474 --> 01:01:04.391
(rockabilly music)

01:01:13.651 --> 01:01:16.748
(phone rings)

01:01:16.748 --> 01:01:19.588
- [Phone] Kevin, Kevin, your phone.

01:01:19.588 --> 01:01:21.051
- What's crack-a-lackin'?

01:01:21.051 --> 01:01:23.990
- Oh nothing, just at my house painting.

01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:25.708
What's up with you?

01:01:25.708 --> 01:01:28.211
- Just finishing up some work right now.

01:01:28.211 --> 01:01:29.378
- That's cool.

01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:33.628
Um...

01:01:33.628 --> 01:01:34.827
You wanna come over later?

01:01:34.827 --> 01:01:36.869
- Yeah, no I'm sorry I can't.

01:01:36.869 --> 01:01:39.289
Kate and I, we have to
wake up like super early

01:01:39.289 --> 01:01:40.771
for this catering thing.

01:01:40.771 --> 01:01:42.190
- So you're gonna ditch me?

01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:43.348
- No, no of course not.

01:01:43.348 --> 01:01:45.470
I'm probably gonna finish on time.

01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:47.491
- Okay, 'cause I need
you to help me setup.

01:01:47.491 --> 01:01:49.074
- Consider it done.

01:01:56.721 --> 01:01:59.451
- So it's called the Friend Zone app.

01:01:59.451 --> 01:02:00.467
It let guys--

01:02:00.467 --> 01:02:01.668
oh sorry.

01:02:01.668 --> 01:02:02.501
Okay.

01:02:03.543 --> 01:02:04.967
- How many more of these?

01:02:04.967 --> 01:02:06.162
How many more?

01:02:06.162 --> 01:02:08.764
- It lets guys know when
they're in the friend zone,

01:02:08.764 --> 01:02:11.605
'cause obviously they don't know

01:02:11.605 --> 01:02:13.428
and they keep trying to call

01:02:13.428 --> 01:02:15.208
(phone buzzes)

01:02:15.208 --> 01:02:18.541
and call.
(phone buzzes)

01:02:19.467 --> 01:02:22.315
And they still try to call me.

01:02:22.315 --> 01:02:23.451
- Okay, thank you.

01:02:23.451 --> 01:02:25.284
So how does this work?

01:02:27.168 --> 01:02:28.001
- I dunno.

01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:31.883
- Okay,

01:02:33.858 --> 01:02:36.359
next we have Avery Smocklestocks,

01:02:36.359 --> 01:02:39.058
with the smart phone breathalyzer.

01:02:39.058 --> 01:02:40.332
- Now, look up now.

01:02:40.332 --> 01:02:41.165
- What?

01:02:41.165 --> 01:02:41.998
- You see that guy?

01:02:41.998 --> 01:02:43.313
That guy in the pink shirt?

01:02:43.313 --> 01:02:44.484
Yeah, I know him.

01:02:44.484 --> 01:02:46.913
All I need is a badge, that's it.

01:02:46.913 --> 01:02:48.426
- Well I need a career.

01:02:48.426 --> 01:02:50.047
- Well we both do.

01:02:50.047 --> 01:02:51.901
This is ridiculous.

01:02:51.901 --> 01:02:53.879
We shoulda done pizza.

01:02:53.879 --> 01:02:55.847
- Blow into it and it tells
you how trashed you are.

01:02:55.847 --> 01:02:58.084
- So, how does it work.

01:02:58.084 --> 01:02:59.604
- I mean I dunno, I thought you guys

01:02:59.604 --> 01:03:00.490
were supposed to tell me.

01:03:00.490 --> 01:03:01.657
- Oh my God...

01:03:02.565 --> 01:03:03.682
Okay, thank you.

01:03:03.682 --> 01:03:06.535
(crowd applauds)

01:03:06.535 --> 01:03:08.055
- Hi, how can I help you?

01:03:08.055 --> 01:03:09.786
- I'm here to get my badge.

01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:11.473
- Your name?

01:03:11.473 --> 01:03:13.288
- Uh, Dillard?

01:03:13.288 --> 01:03:14.935
- Gotcha.

01:03:14.935 --> 01:03:16.268
- Oh, thank you.

01:03:18.646 --> 01:03:20.572
- Next, we have Pinky Stinkelhiemer

01:03:20.572 --> 01:03:22.239
with True Superhero.

01:03:27.527 --> 01:03:31.031
- Hello, my name is Pinky Noodlebaker

01:03:31.031 --> 01:03:34.114
and I am here to show you my new app,

01:03:34.971 --> 01:03:36.345
True Superhero.

01:03:36.345 --> 01:03:38.288
- Is this your nephew or something?

01:03:38.288 --> 01:03:40.565
No?
- True Superhero is able to be

01:03:40.565 --> 01:03:43.605
able to show you, even you, your favorite

01:03:43.605 --> 01:03:45.989
super human and the possibility that he

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:47.902
can be your best friend.

01:03:47.902 --> 01:03:50.526
From the low price of 2.99, even you

01:03:50.526 --> 01:03:54.026
could exist as a super human in real life.

01:03:54.885 --> 01:03:57.635
(crowd applauds)

01:03:58.507 --> 01:03:59.340
- Dillard?

01:04:00.574 --> 01:04:01.849
Psst, Dillard. Dillard!

01:04:01.849 --> 01:04:03.929
You're up after this speech.

01:04:03.929 --> 01:04:05.179
- Cool, thanks.

01:04:06.943 --> 01:04:08.789
Oh don't, don't worry about it.

01:04:08.789 --> 01:04:10.693
- We are lucky to be in the presence

01:04:10.693 --> 01:04:12.664
in one of the godfathers
of web development.

01:04:12.664 --> 01:04:15.552
Next, give it up for our
host, Steve Carmichael.

01:04:15.552 --> 01:04:18.302
(crowd applauds)

01:04:25.451 --> 01:04:28.909
- Youth hold the key to our future.

01:04:28.909 --> 01:04:32.327
I met a kid the other day
that reminded me of myself.

01:04:32.327 --> 01:04:35.902
He was young, bright,
he was full of ambition.

01:04:35.902 --> 01:04:39.443
- Hey, he's talking about me
I was impressed.

01:04:39.443 --> 01:04:42.513
There's only one difference.

01:04:42.513 --> 01:04:44.763
He was so socially awkward.

01:04:45.796 --> 01:04:49.963
His body language was like a
dog trapped in a sleeping bag.

01:04:50.976 --> 01:04:52.711
- I don't understand that.

01:04:52.711 --> 01:04:54.773
- And I thought, "How
could a guy like this ever

01:04:54.773 --> 01:04:57.453
"get the nerve up to talk to girls?"

01:04:57.453 --> 01:04:59.987
I mean how could this
guy ever have the balls

01:04:59.987 --> 01:05:04.534
to talk to a women and
have any chance at all.

01:05:04.534 --> 01:05:07.393
After talking to him
for a while I realized

01:05:07.393 --> 01:05:09.871
he wasn't completely hopeless.

01:05:09.871 --> 01:05:12.497
All he needed was a way to break the ice,

01:05:12.497 --> 01:05:13.914
with Ice Breaker.

01:05:19.436 --> 01:05:20.513
(man sneezes)

01:05:20.513 --> 01:05:21.651
Bless you.

01:05:21.651 --> 01:05:23.276
- [TV] Ever imagine yourself
(knocks)

01:05:23.276 --> 01:05:27.443
on a deserted island with a
blonde, brunette, redhead?

01:05:28.334 --> 01:05:31.211
- [Kevin] Shea, I'm coming in.

01:05:31.211 --> 01:05:32.217
Shea where are you?

01:05:32.217 --> 01:05:33.117
Where are you?

01:05:33.117 --> 01:05:33.950
- Whoa, what're you doing?

01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:34.783
What're you doing?

01:05:34.783 --> 01:05:37.072
We need to talk about
your dad right now, okay?

01:05:37.072 --> 01:05:38.811
Wait, who the hell are you!?

01:05:38.811 --> 01:05:39.952
Who is this?

01:05:39.952 --> 01:05:41.886
Wait seriously, you're cheating on me?

01:05:41.886 --> 01:05:43.311
This is what's going on right now?

01:05:43.311 --> 01:05:44.307
- Cheating on you?

01:05:44.307 --> 01:05:45.523
Who do you think you are?

01:05:45.523 --> 01:05:46.867
- Well we hooked up like three days ago

01:05:46.867 --> 01:05:48.441
and you can't even contain yourself?

01:05:48.441 --> 01:05:49.767
Who are you, man?

01:05:49.767 --> 01:05:51.060
- You want a drink?

01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:52.288
- No I don't want a drink.

01:05:52.288 --> 01:05:53.326
You know what?

01:05:53.326 --> 01:05:54.315
You know what, okay.

01:05:54.315 --> 01:05:55.675
You and your dad deserve
each other, alright?

01:05:55.675 --> 01:05:57.331
And you know what, you
see this stupid pear?

01:05:57.331 --> 01:05:59.085
Yeah that stupid pear and you're as fake

01:05:59.085 --> 01:06:01.790
as this little tiny fake apple, alright?

01:06:01.790 --> 01:06:04.247
Oh, and you see the world through fake,

01:06:04.247 --> 01:06:06.425
stupid sunglasses and that's why you don't

01:06:06.425 --> 01:06:08.886
deserve them because they're stupid.

01:06:08.886 --> 01:06:09.719
Yeah, catch!

01:06:09.719 --> 01:06:10.750
- Are you done?

01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:12.748
- Oh yeah, and I'm not
even close to being done.

01:06:12.748 --> 01:06:13.947
You see this right here?

01:06:13.947 --> 01:06:14.808
You see this Jenga?

01:06:14.808 --> 01:06:16.350
Well Jenga, bitch.

01:06:16.350 --> 01:06:17.923
Okay, let's do this.
- Are you done yet?

01:06:17.923 --> 01:06:19.048
- Oh, okay?

01:06:19.048 --> 01:06:21.210
You probably don't play
the freakin' guitar.

01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:22.870
- No, okay, it was a gift!

01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:23.703
- Oh, it was a gift?

01:06:23.703 --> 01:06:25.036
Well watch this!

01:06:26.036 --> 01:06:27.241
- Y'all get the cops over here,

01:06:27.241 --> 01:06:28.241
I'm outta here.
- Oh, oh.

01:06:28.241 --> 01:06:29.497
Don't you dare!

01:06:29.497 --> 01:06:31.311
Don't you dare, I will call the cops.

01:06:31.311 --> 01:06:32.901
I will call the cops on you.

01:06:32.901 --> 01:06:34.610
Do not, don't.

01:06:34.610 --> 01:06:37.693
(police siren wails)

01:06:42.881 --> 01:06:46.464
(melancholic guitar music)

01:07:11.145 --> 01:07:12.022
- Lana it's just--

01:07:12.022 --> 01:07:13.541
- Just stop.

01:07:13.541 --> 01:07:15.458
Just tell me the truth.

01:07:18.438 --> 01:07:19.271
Who's Shea?

01:07:19.271 --> 01:07:20.703
- Lana, I mean Shea is just--

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:22.397
Her dad was supposed to--

01:07:22.397 --> 01:07:23.778
- Just stop.

01:07:23.778 --> 01:07:25.528
I trusted you, Kevin.

01:07:27.716 --> 01:07:28.549
Wow.

01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:29.893
- Lana, come on.

01:07:29.893 --> 01:07:31.814
- Here's the money I made last night.

01:07:31.814 --> 01:07:34.064
Minus your bail, of course.

01:07:36.250 --> 01:07:37.671
Don't call me.

01:07:37.671 --> 01:07:39.494
- I don't need this money, okay.

01:07:39.494 --> 01:07:41.970
I'm just hanging onto it for you.

01:07:41.970 --> 01:07:44.013
- No buddy, don't buy things online.

01:07:44.013 --> 01:07:46.272
I once tried to get a
phone and they showed up

01:07:46.272 --> 01:07:48.538
with a Swiss cheese package.

01:07:48.538 --> 01:07:50.791
No, like the whole deal.

01:07:50.791 --> 01:07:51.796
Knives and all.

01:07:51.796 --> 01:07:53.258
Hold on one second.

01:07:53.258 --> 01:07:54.290
Kevin.

01:07:54.290 --> 01:07:56.218
- Hey, I tried to use my key.

01:07:56.218 --> 01:07:57.898
- I tried to call you last night,

01:07:57.898 --> 01:07:59.148
your week's up.

01:08:00.619 --> 01:08:02.255
- What am I supposed to do?

01:08:02.255 --> 01:08:04.118
- I mean I would love to have you stay,

01:08:04.118 --> 01:08:05.827
but rules are rules.

01:08:05.827 --> 01:08:08.249
You just gotta move on, bud.

01:08:08.249 --> 01:08:09.713
- Okay, well here.

01:08:09.713 --> 01:08:11.953
- I watched your bags for ya.

01:08:11.953 --> 01:08:13.036
- Okay. Um...

01:08:15.558 --> 01:08:17.465
- Well good luck out there.

01:08:17.465 --> 01:08:18.790
You'll make it.

01:08:18.790 --> 01:08:20.308
Just smile for 'em.

01:08:20.308 --> 01:08:21.308
Be yourself.

01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:26.238
Be that sweet little
prince I know you are.

01:08:26.238 --> 01:08:27.654
- Stupid, stupid.

01:08:28.527 --> 01:08:30.673
I mean like freakin' Nora Jones?

01:08:30.673 --> 01:08:32.185
I mean she's probably just...

01:08:32.185 --> 01:08:33.670
Voice is okay, I guess.

01:08:33.670 --> 01:08:35.252
I mean it's better than mine.

01:08:35.252 --> 01:08:36.993
Who's that guy with the fedora?

01:08:36.993 --> 01:08:39.589
And he probably has a good
app, it's probably great.

01:08:39.589 --> 01:08:40.716
Willy Nelson?

01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:41.573
I mean what did he do?

01:08:41.573 --> 01:08:43.595
He just smokes pot, but
I can't make an app.

01:08:43.595 --> 01:08:44.767
I mean who am I?

01:08:44.767 --> 01:08:46.131
I mean really, I mean please, please.

01:08:46.131 --> 01:08:47.180
Lana! No!

01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:48.014
Lana!

01:08:50.063 --> 01:08:52.729
(Kevin screams)

01:08:57.961 --> 01:08:59.779
Oh sorry, I didn't see you there,

01:08:59.779 --> 01:09:00.613
I'll just...

01:09:00.613 --> 01:09:03.029
(Kevin sobs)

01:09:04.953 --> 01:09:08.202
- You couldn't put more
babes in a single radius.

01:09:08.202 --> 01:09:09.983
- Hey, can you y'all give me a ride?

01:09:09.983 --> 01:09:11.183
- Whoa hang on, whoa, whoa, dude.

01:09:11.183 --> 01:09:12.562
Where are you headed?

01:09:12.562 --> 01:09:14.380
- I dunno, Lubbock.

01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:15.496
Let's say that.

01:09:15.496 --> 01:09:16.420
- Now we're talking.

01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:17.439
- Wait, are you done?

01:09:17.439 --> 01:09:18.613
- Yeah man, I'm done.

01:09:18.613 --> 01:09:19.446
Going home.

01:09:19.446 --> 01:09:21.216
- What you couldn't find
a couch to sleep on?

01:09:21.216 --> 01:09:22.049
No one?

01:09:22.049 --> 01:09:23.572
- No, I cannot.

01:09:23.572 --> 01:09:27.479
- Wow, you know God invented
the world in seven days

01:09:27.479 --> 01:09:29.466
and you couldn't make
one friend in a week.

01:09:29.466 --> 01:09:30.466
- Thank you.

01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:35.680
- I'm getting a bigger cut of this, Rocky.

01:09:36.969 --> 01:09:39.354
- You really don't have to
worry, a lot of babes at bay.

01:09:39.354 --> 01:09:41.136
- She bailed you out of jail!?

01:09:41.136 --> 01:09:42.774
Oh my God, you blew it.

01:09:42.774 --> 01:09:44.598
Okay, let's spitball some ideas here.

01:09:44.598 --> 01:09:45.950
What do girls like?

01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:48.634
Ryan Gosling, free
drinks, 80s dance parties.

01:09:48.634 --> 01:09:50.473
- Wait, wait, what're we spitballing?

01:09:50.473 --> 01:09:51.305
- Mimosas?

01:09:51.305 --> 01:09:52.139
- Mimosas.

01:09:52.139 --> 01:09:53.627
- Why are you spitballing ideas?

01:09:53.627 --> 01:09:55.989
- Because you want to get her back, right?

01:09:55.989 --> 01:09:57.227
- No, dude--

01:09:57.227 --> 01:09:58.403
- You blew it.

01:09:58.403 --> 01:10:00.264
- No, you don't understand.

01:10:00.264 --> 01:10:01.808
This is a lose-lose situation.

01:10:01.808 --> 01:10:03.237
She hates me, okay.

01:10:03.237 --> 01:10:06.165
And I just gotta get outta here.

01:10:06.165 --> 01:10:09.427
- Look, I know it's scary to put yourself

01:10:09.427 --> 01:10:12.203
out there and be vulnerable, but like

01:10:12.203 --> 01:10:13.825
if there's something you want,

01:10:13.825 --> 01:10:15.658
you got to take risks.

01:10:15.658 --> 01:10:18.702
Like there's a sacrifice you have to make

01:10:18.702 --> 01:10:20.535
to find what you love.

01:10:21.421 --> 01:10:23.165
Rocky, we've embarrassed ourselves.

01:10:23.165 --> 01:10:24.131
- Absolutely.

01:10:24.131 --> 01:10:25.805
- We embarrass ourselves everyday.

01:10:25.805 --> 01:10:26.853
- Everyday.

01:10:26.853 --> 01:10:28.158
- Every single day.

01:10:28.158 --> 01:10:29.995
We're embarrassing ourselves right now,

01:10:29.995 --> 01:10:31.063
as we speak.

01:10:31.063 --> 01:10:32.234
- You wanna go to Lubbock?

01:10:32.234 --> 01:10:33.244
- Okay, I'm not going on like a two-seater

01:10:33.244 --> 01:10:35.244
Lubbock ride with Rocky.

01:10:38.658 --> 01:10:39.491
I might.

01:10:47.026 --> 01:10:50.443
(spiritual Indian music)

01:11:01.892 --> 01:11:04.222
- Thank you for driving
me from the airport.

01:11:04.222 --> 01:11:05.423
- Namaste, man.

01:11:05.423 --> 01:11:06.929
- I just feel like the
universe is coming together,

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:08.507
we're getting back to Pangaea.

01:11:08.507 --> 01:11:10.164
I really appreciate it.

01:11:10.164 --> 01:11:13.581
I feel like the world has given its gift.

01:11:14.791 --> 01:11:16.711
- Figured it's all karam.

01:11:16.711 --> 01:11:19.088
You got a ride, and I
just got my girlfriend

01:11:19.088 --> 01:11:21.330
back in New York after
she finagled a ticket

01:11:21.330 --> 01:11:23.306
from some goober.

01:11:23.306 --> 01:11:24.639
- Whoa, hold on.

01:11:25.824 --> 01:11:28.109
- She's a spiritual goddess.

01:11:28.109 --> 01:11:30.871
Makes me feel like a little child again.

01:11:30.871 --> 01:11:34.288
She's like the mist from the alpine snow.

01:11:35.410 --> 01:11:38.013
- Are you talking about Lampshade?

01:11:38.013 --> 01:11:39.469
- You know Lampshade?

01:11:39.469 --> 01:11:40.657
You met her.

01:11:40.657 --> 01:11:42.429
- Yeah, I know Lampshade.

01:11:42.429 --> 01:11:44.290
I'm the goober!

01:11:44.290 --> 01:11:46.051
I bought the ticket.

01:11:46.051 --> 01:11:49.456
- I'm sorry, look that stuff happens.

01:11:49.456 --> 01:11:52.051
I was at this girl's house the other day,

01:11:52.051 --> 01:11:54.348
she lives in a high-rise and I was about

01:11:54.348 --> 01:11:57.747
to nut my load, and
that's probably bad karma,

01:11:57.747 --> 01:11:59.925
but it's good karma for us.

01:11:59.925 --> 01:12:02.729
I was just about to get
off when her boyfriend

01:12:02.729 --> 01:12:05.487
smashes in and starts breaking everything

01:12:05.487 --> 01:12:10.164
and the cops show up, I got
a warrant for my arrest.

01:12:10.164 --> 01:12:12.368
I straight up based jumped out of there.

01:12:12.368 --> 01:12:15.125
You just paid a little ticket price

01:12:15.125 --> 01:12:18.390
and got to spend time with
a spiritual goddess, man.

01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:20.128
Who's holy.

01:12:20.128 --> 01:12:21.628
It's all good man.

01:12:24.423 --> 01:12:26.803
I got blocked, okay?

01:12:26.803 --> 01:12:27.970
Just like you.

01:12:29.457 --> 01:12:31.203
- What goes around, comes around.

01:12:31.203 --> 01:12:32.036
Namaste.

01:12:32.036 --> 01:12:32.869
Shalom.

01:12:32.869 --> 01:12:34.611
- Sure you got spiritual--

01:12:34.611 --> 01:12:35.528
- I'm done.

01:12:37.867 --> 01:12:39.043
Kevin?

01:12:39.043 --> 01:12:40.462
- You're back.

01:12:40.462 --> 01:12:41.888
- Are you leaving?

01:12:41.888 --> 01:12:44.150
- I'm not, I've been waiting for you since

01:12:44.150 --> 01:12:46.883
I got kicked out of the hostel, man.

01:12:46.883 --> 01:12:49.349
- Why did you stay in a hostel for?

01:12:49.349 --> 01:12:52.571
- 'Cause it's the only
place I could afford.

01:12:52.571 --> 01:12:54.483
- Why didn't you just stay here?

01:12:54.483 --> 01:12:56.511
You didn't see my note?

01:12:56.511 --> 01:12:57.698
- What?

01:12:57.698 --> 01:13:00.007
Yeah, I saw the note, but
the only thing it said

01:13:00.007 --> 01:13:02.507
was that you left for India.

01:13:02.507 --> 01:13:05.568
- No, like on the back of the note.

01:13:05.568 --> 01:13:07.651
How did you not see that?

01:13:10.333 --> 01:13:11.333
- Oh my God.

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:14.928
- So I've met the lead singer of this band

01:13:14.928 --> 01:13:17.925
like 10 times, but he never remembers me.

01:13:17.925 --> 01:13:21.467
I think he's always drunk
every time I meet him

01:13:21.467 --> 01:13:23.509
and he hit on me once.

01:13:23.509 --> 01:13:26.320
Gave me a free ride though,
that was pretty cool.

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:28.229
Okay, so which one are you gonna wear?

01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:29.523
You gonna wear red with me?

01:13:29.523 --> 01:13:31.440
We could both wear red.

01:13:32.328 --> 01:13:36.523
- I went by his hotel and
all of his stuff was gone.

01:13:36.523 --> 01:13:38.559
- Okay, so you like the purple one too?

01:13:38.559 --> 01:13:40.536
That's what I heard, purple.

01:13:40.536 --> 01:13:42.103
You gonna wear purple?

01:13:42.103 --> 01:13:43.216
- Should I call him?

01:13:43.216 --> 01:13:44.701
- Okay, so none of these, this.

01:13:44.701 --> 01:13:45.965
Good, and no.

01:13:45.965 --> 01:13:48.146
You're gonna stop worrying about it.

01:13:48.146 --> 01:13:48.979
- Really?

01:13:48.979 --> 01:13:49.812
- Yeah.

01:13:49.812 --> 01:13:50.795
- Should I call him?

01:13:50.795 --> 01:13:52.059
- Let me see.

01:13:52.059 --> 01:13:54.836
No, you should put that dress on

01:13:54.836 --> 01:13:57.035
and come to this concert
and get drunk with me.

01:13:57.035 --> 01:13:58.619
Get a little silly,

01:13:58.619 --> 01:14:00.598
you gonna get a little silly?
- How silly? How drunk?

01:14:00.598 --> 01:14:01.714
- How drunk?

01:14:01.714 --> 01:14:02.955
Like this drunk.

01:14:02.955 --> 01:14:04.128
Like this drunk.

01:14:04.128 --> 01:14:04.977
- Like this drunk?

01:14:04.977 --> 01:14:06.534
- Kinda like this drunk.

01:14:06.534 --> 01:14:07.905
We're gonna have a good time.

01:14:07.905 --> 01:14:08.738
People be like, "Y'all
having a good time?"

01:14:08.738 --> 01:14:10.088
We'll be like, "We're having a good time."

01:14:10.088 --> 01:14:11.448
We're having such a good time.

01:14:11.448 --> 01:14:15.156
You're stupid, put the
dress on, put this on.

01:14:15.156 --> 01:14:18.323
(bong water splashes)

01:14:20.635 --> 01:14:23.218
(Tyler coughs)

01:14:25.564 --> 01:14:28.065
- Dude, she bailed you out of jail!

01:14:28.065 --> 01:14:28.898
- Yeah.

01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:32.662
- Damn, that is rough.

01:14:32.662 --> 01:14:34.177
(video game noises)
That reminds me

01:14:34.177 --> 01:14:35.776
of something my dad said.

01:14:35.776 --> 01:14:37.901
He said love is like a fart.

01:14:37.901 --> 01:14:42.402
You try to force it and you're
just gonna shit yourself.

01:14:42.402 --> 01:14:44.569
He's divorced now, anyway.

01:14:47.705 --> 01:14:50.222
- Have you ever been in love?

01:14:50.222 --> 01:14:51.639
- Yeah, one time.

01:14:52.642 --> 01:14:54.641
- So what'd you do?

01:14:54.641 --> 01:14:56.324
- I never told her.

01:14:56.324 --> 01:14:57.157
- Why not?

01:14:58.379 --> 01:15:00.046
- She never told me.

01:15:01.043 --> 01:15:05.043
I mean I made the right
moves, look at me, dude.

01:15:06.584 --> 01:15:07.417
- Oh...

01:15:09.466 --> 01:15:12.806
- You wanna go slip and slide, man?

01:15:12.806 --> 01:15:16.187
You wanna set shit on fire or...

01:15:16.187 --> 01:15:19.088
You wanna have a noodle race?

01:15:19.088 --> 01:15:22.207
(phone rings)

01:15:22.207 --> 01:15:23.540
- [Phone] Kevin.

01:15:29.252 --> 01:15:30.441
- Honey, men are pigs.

01:15:30.441 --> 01:15:32.941
What you need is a good woman.

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:35.090
- Amen to that.

01:15:36.886 --> 01:15:37.719
Nice.

01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:45.923
(phone buzzes)

01:15:48.098 --> 01:15:49.602
Kevin?

01:15:49.602 --> 01:15:51.195
- Kate?

01:15:51.195 --> 01:15:53.057
Hey, hey, where's Lana?

01:15:53.057 --> 01:15:54.898
- We're at a concert.

01:15:54.898 --> 01:15:56.475
Where are you?

01:15:56.475 --> 01:15:58.600
- Wait, what concert are you at?

01:15:58.600 --> 01:15:59.433
Kate?

01:16:00.529 --> 01:16:01.362
Kate?

01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:07.454
Dang it, Dadnobit, Lloyd
Doggit, son-of-a...

01:16:07.454 --> 01:16:09.079
- Kevin?

01:16:09.079 --> 01:16:09.912
Kevin?

01:16:18.250 --> 01:16:22.510
- Dabnabbit, Doggotit,
biscuit eating bulldog!

01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:24.133
Every freaking time.

01:16:24.133 --> 01:16:25.815
You know it's never died,
but now it dies today!

01:16:25.815 --> 01:16:27.674
- Hey, find your center man.

01:16:27.674 --> 01:16:28.695
What's going on?

01:16:28.695 --> 01:16:30.439
- My phone, it's freaking dead, okay?

01:16:30.439 --> 01:16:31.351
- Just use mine.

01:16:31.351 --> 01:16:32.999
- I can't, I don't know her phone number.

01:16:32.999 --> 01:16:34.170
Wait, wait no.

01:16:34.170 --> 01:16:35.799
She said she was at a concert somewhere.

01:16:35.799 --> 01:16:37.458
- Alright, what concert?

01:16:37.458 --> 01:16:38.291
- I dunno.

01:16:39.495 --> 01:16:43.662
- Good luck man, there's like
40 concerts a night here.

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:47.000
- I gotta try, at least.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:47.917
- Try what?

01:16:49.262 --> 01:16:51.429
- I just don't know, okay?

01:16:52.934 --> 01:16:56.017
- Just don't do what you're gonna do.

01:16:57.979 --> 01:17:00.062
It's all about love, man.

01:17:01.012 --> 01:17:02.480
Namaste!

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:06.647
("Jive Babe" by Mikhael Paskalev)

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.239
- So what did he say?

01:17:39.239 --> 01:17:43.406
- Nothing really, he just asked
where you were and hung up.

01:17:45.315 --> 01:17:46.972
- Well let me call him back.

01:17:46.972 --> 01:17:48.435
- No, I tried Lana.

01:17:48.435 --> 01:17:50.518
I think his phone's dead.

01:17:54.609 --> 01:17:55.612
- Maybe he--

01:17:55.612 --> 01:17:57.169
- No, no.

01:17:57.169 --> 01:17:58.711
Lana, shh.

01:17:58.711 --> 01:18:00.433
Forget about it, okay?

01:18:00.433 --> 01:18:02.092
If he cared about you--

01:18:02.092 --> 01:18:03.026
Gross Lana.

01:18:03.026 --> 01:18:06.828
If he cared about you, he would be here.

01:18:06.828 --> 01:18:10.400
- You know, he probably has a small dick.

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:11.649
- What?

01:18:11.649 --> 01:18:13.067
You haven't seen it?

01:18:13.067 --> 01:18:15.490
I bet he has a tiny penis.

01:18:15.490 --> 01:18:16.898
- She blew him!

01:18:16.898 --> 01:18:18.487
- It's like tootsie roll.

01:18:18.487 --> 01:18:20.828
- He slept with another girl!

01:18:20.828 --> 01:18:23.787
It's so, what's that about?

01:18:23.787 --> 01:18:25.183
- He's a jerk.

01:18:25.183 --> 01:18:26.555
- You know, you're probably right.

01:18:26.555 --> 01:18:27.972
- I know, I know.

01:18:32.334 --> 01:18:34.417
- I enjoy paying for art.

01:18:37.185 --> 01:18:38.183
- Hey, hey.

01:18:38.183 --> 01:18:39.209
$15.

01:18:39.209 --> 01:18:40.284
- Sir, sir, okay.

01:18:40.284 --> 01:18:41.525
Just let me explain.

01:18:41.525 --> 01:18:42.830
- Wait, wait.
- Hey, Lana!

01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:43.839
- Hey.

01:18:43.839 --> 01:18:44.672
- She's right there!

01:18:44.672 --> 01:18:45.982
- $15 to get in.

01:18:45.982 --> 01:18:47.422
- Okay, okay. Fine.

01:18:47.422 --> 01:18:49.284
Well you know what, I
don't have any money, okay?

01:18:49.284 --> 01:18:52.342
But what I do have is a heart.

01:18:52.342 --> 01:18:53.657
- Oh yeah?

01:18:53.657 --> 01:18:54.654
- Yeah.

01:18:54.654 --> 01:18:57.302
You just made the biggest
mistake of your life, buddy.

01:18:57.302 --> 01:18:58.662
- I doubt that.

01:18:58.662 --> 01:19:00.779
(knuckles crack)

01:19:00.779 --> 01:19:01.612
Get out!

01:19:04.457 --> 01:19:06.042
- Let's just go dance.

01:19:06.042 --> 01:19:07.181
- Yeah.

01:19:07.181 --> 01:19:09.764
(crowd cheers)

01:19:15.322 --> 01:19:16.545
- Oh my God!

01:19:16.545 --> 01:19:18.006
What the--

01:19:18.006 --> 01:19:19.302
Oh my God.

01:19:19.302 --> 01:19:20.923
Get outta here.

01:19:20.923 --> 01:19:22.455
It's a madman.

01:19:22.455 --> 01:19:23.441
- I can't believe you did that.

01:19:23.441 --> 01:19:25.163
- Lana, I don't know if you're there

01:19:25.163 --> 01:19:26.617
or if you're in the bathroom or something,

01:19:26.617 --> 01:19:28.043
but there's something I need to tell you

01:19:28.043 --> 01:19:29.520
so please just listen to me.

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:30.551
- [Guy] Dork!

01:19:30.551 --> 01:19:32.799
- Okay, you know what, I
can handle being a dork,

01:19:32.799 --> 01:19:34.761
but what I can't handle is
never seeing Lana again,

01:19:34.761 --> 01:19:36.785
so please just let me talk.

01:19:36.785 --> 01:19:38.822
(organ piano)

01:19:38.822 --> 01:19:40.038
Oh, thank you.

01:19:40.038 --> 01:19:42.145
For all you people out
there, if you're with someone

01:19:42.145 --> 01:19:44.065
you care about, someone that showed you

01:19:44.065 --> 01:19:46.142
how to be yourself, then keep them

01:19:46.142 --> 01:19:48.843
because that, my friends, is valuable.

01:19:48.843 --> 01:19:52.426
That feeling is worth
far more than any car

01:19:54.204 --> 01:19:56.537
or stupid app on your phone.

01:19:57.576 --> 01:19:59.200
I met this girl this--

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:00.765
- [Lana] Kevin.

01:20:00.765 --> 01:20:01.598
- Lana.

01:20:05.443 --> 01:20:06.276
Lana.

01:20:08.372 --> 01:20:11.801
I don't know what you ever saw in me,

01:20:11.801 --> 01:20:14.737
but I know what I see in you.

01:20:14.737 --> 01:20:16.611
- Oh yeah, what's that?

01:20:16.611 --> 01:20:18.387
(crowd cheers)

01:20:18.387 --> 01:20:22.554
("We'll Get High" by Willie McGee)

01:20:36.028 --> 01:20:38.195
- Sweet pink shirt, Kevin.

01:20:39.150 --> 01:20:41.908
It's not pink, it's salmon.

01:20:41.908 --> 01:20:44.491
(crowd cheers)

01:21:23.524 --> 01:21:24.357
- Buster.

01:21:26.828 --> 01:21:28.578
He's such a good guy.

01:21:32.810 --> 01:21:34.011
He was so young.

01:21:34.011 --> 01:21:36.011
I knew he had it in him!
