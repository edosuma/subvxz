that ability to mimic here,

12:44.013 --> 12:46.724
The reason why I got into social media
and dancing here

12:46.807 --> 12:49.977
is because of trending dances
in Atlanta that came out.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.896

I was born in the Democratic Republic

13:18.756 --> 13:21.175
Coming to Atlanta,
I felt alone for a long time.

13:21.383 --> 13:23.844
So, like, I was self-taught, like,
all I do... I'd just be in my room,

13:23.928 --> 13:26.764
just dancing every day. We met and, like,
and then we just started hanging out,

13:26.847 --> 13:28.432
doing videos with each other.
You know what I'm saying?

13:28.516 --> 13:30.100
We're like,
"Wow, we have a lot in common."

13:30.184 --> 13:31.769

Some people might get ideas from that.
