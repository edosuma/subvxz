Sadie, better hurry up!
I'm gonna lock you in!

<i>Hey, just a sec.</i>

00:37.504 --> 00:40.339
Don't be too scared.
It's just me.

00:40.407 --> 00:43.275
I'm on my way over to
a spooky-Movie party.

00:43.343 --> 00:47.046
- You want to come?
- Party?

00:47.114 --> 00:50.839
- Who's throwing it?
- Ronaldo, the french fryman.

00:50.874 --> 00:52.985
Ugh! That social napalm?

00:53.086 --> 00:56.255
Do what you want, man.
I got better things to do than

00:56.356 --> 01:00.926
Wax weird with Beach City's
biggest bozo, Ronaldo.

01:00.994 --> 01:04.596
Okay.
Oh, ha! Nice timing, Steven.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.333
Hey, should we head over to Ronaldo's?

01:07.401 --> 01:10.536
Yeah!
I'm-A get so scared!

01:11.855 --> 01:13.105
Night, Lars.

01:13.173 --> 01:18.077
- Nighty-Night.
- Hey! Wait up!

01:21.813 --> 01:26.485
- So, where's this thing at?
- It's right up there.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.894
Steven!

01:34.895 --> 01:40.259
Welcome to my Beach City horror club.

01:44.204 --> 01:47.273
More like comedy club.

01:47.340 --> 01:51.277
Lars?! Oh!
What are you doing here?

01:51.344 --> 01:54.914
Um...
uh, c-c-c-come in.

01:54.981 --> 01:57.983
I'm scared already.

01:58.051 --> 02:00.286
Ronaldo, right? Yeah.
I'm Sadie.

02:00.353 --> 02:04.455
Nice to finally officially meet you.

02:04.658 --> 02:05.991
Boo!

02:07.278 --> 02:10.513
Steven, you're friends with Lars?

02:10.548 --> 02:14.100
Yeah. Isn't everybody?

02:14.201 --> 02:16.621
- Oh, boy!
- Yeah!

02:17.370 --> 02:21.307
Our first film tonight is
a rare classic that hardly

02:21.374 --> 02:27.480
needs introduction ...
"Evil bear 2: Bearly alive."

02:27.547 --> 02:30.449
What? I've seen that.
It's boring.

02:30.517 --> 02:34.286
And that stupid fake C.G. bear!
Hardly looks like it's

02:34.354 --> 02:39.925
- really killing anybody.
- C.G.?! Blasphemer!

02:39.993 --> 02:43.195
You saw the remake!
I have the original.

02:43.263 --> 02:46.265
A true fan would accept nothing less.

02:46.333 --> 02:49.034
Whoa, man.
Take it down a notch.

02:49.102 --> 02:51.637
Whoa, wait.
How did you get a copy of that?

02:51.738 --> 02:53.839
Can I see the box?

02:53.840 --> 02:55.941
Whoa! In this cut, you actually

02:56.009 --> 02:58.277
see evil bear eat the Hermit's leg.

02:58.345 --> 03:01.446
Ho! Oh, is this gonna
be a bit much for him?

03:01.481 --> 03:03.048
I can handle it!

03:04.206 --> 03:08.354
Yo, Steven, are you sure you
can see with the couch in your way?

03:08.421 --> 03:12.191
<i>- You're... eating my... leg!
- Oh!</i>

03:12.259 --> 03:14.593
Oh, did I miss the part where

03:14.694 --> 03:17.630
- you can see the sound guy?
- Hey!

03:17.697 --> 03:20.232
<i>- It was just getting good!
- What's going on?</i>

03:20.300 --> 03:24.403
- Probably just a fuse.
- Or maybe it's a gho-o-st?

03:24.471 --> 03:27.606
- Good one.
- No, really.

03:27.674 --> 03:32.344
What if it's a gho-o-o-o-st?
As a skeptic of mortality,

03:32.412 --> 03:36.115
I've long suspected that
this place might be haunted.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.551
Aha!

03:38.552 --> 03:42.054
Spirit, I beseech you!

03:42.122 --> 03:44.456
Dude, cut it out.
You're being super-weird.

03:44.524 --> 03:48.561
We wish to make contact!

03:48.562 --> 03:52.598
Please, spirit, send us a sign.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.867
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

03:54.935 --> 03:59.862
- Ow!
- Spirit, that was a good sign.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.474
But could you send a couple more
like that, just to be sure?

04:03.542 --> 04:06.478
Whoa!

04:06.546 --> 04:09.215
That's ... that's okay, spirit.

04:09.282 --> 04:13.953
- You can rein it in a little!
- How is this happening?!

04:14.020 --> 04:18.156
This... is amazing!
A real-life haunted house!

04:20.744 --> 04:23.262
Look out!

04:23.330 --> 04:25.948
Let's get out of here!

04:25.949 --> 04:28.567
It won't open!

04:31.121 --> 04:33.606
I'm so sorry!

04:33.673 --> 04:37.309
I had no idea there was this
violent of a presence here.

04:37.377 --> 04:39.645
- It happens.
- No, it doesn't!

04:39.713 --> 04:43.315
- It's not a ghost!
- Who cares what it is?

04:43.383 --> 04:45.382
We need to get out of here!

04:47.254 --> 04:48.988
You know, I deal with this

04:49.055 --> 04:52.558
kind of stuff on a regular basis,
but, uh, you, uh, looked

04:52.626 --> 04:54.960
- pretty cool back there.
- Yeah?

04:55.028 --> 04:59.899
- Yeah! You really took charge.
- When stuff gets hairy, I just

04:59.966 --> 05:03.969
- keep my eyes forward, you know?
- Once the civilians are safe,

05:04.070 --> 05:06.272
I'm gonna come back to investigate.

05:06.339 --> 05:09.909
If you wanted to help...

05:09.976 --> 05:12.344
- Is something wrong, Lars?
- Oh, shh!

05:14.197 --> 05:15.948
What is that?

05:16.016 --> 05:18.851
Oh, it's nothing!
We're all just hearing things

05:18.919 --> 05:22.154
and seeing things and feeling
things that aren't real!

Have you ever seen a haunting this bad?!

05:42.075 --> 05:45.611
This is no
run-of-the-mill haunting!

05:45.679 --> 05:48.881
It's a poltergeist!

05:48.882 --> 05:52.084
A "ghost" only haunts a house.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.904
A poltergeist haunts a person!

05:54.905 --> 05:57.623
They're usually attracted to the

05:57.691 --> 06:03.535
terrifying inner world of
the emotionally disturbed!

06:04.464 --> 06:06.966
You think stuff is coming after me?!

06:07.033 --> 06:09.101
How can you listen to this weird guy?

06:09.169 --> 06:11.904
He practically lives in a haunted house.

06:11.972 --> 06:15.174
Don't you think maybe he had
something to do with it?

06:15.241 --> 06:19.345
I think you can stop
being such a dink to Ronaldo.

06:20.974 --> 06:23.315
Sadie, you're not an idiot!

06:23.383 --> 06:26.289
<i>- Hey!
- Do you believe all of this?!</i>

06:26.324 --> 06:28.454
- I...
- All this stuff ... they've got

06:28.521 --> 06:31.991
to be doing it somehow.
We've got to ditch these guys.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.577
Come on.

06:35.378 --> 06:37.062
I'm not ditching anyone.

06:37.130 --> 06:40.366
But what about me, huh?!
Sadie, come on. You always ...

06:40.433 --> 06:43.786
Huh?

06:45.933 --> 06:48.854
- Sadie?
- The spirit took her!

06:48.855 --> 06:51.276
You're gonna drag us all down

06:51.344 --> 06:53.078
with you!
Don't you even care?!

06:53.146 --> 06:56.298
<i>Lars!</i>

06:56.299 --> 06:59.451
The basement!

06:59.519 --> 07:04.223
- I don't see her anywhere!
- Spirit, show yourself!

07:04.290 --> 07:06.992
It's close. I can feel it.

07:07.093 --> 07:11.755
It's hurting and... obsessed.

07:16.069 --> 07:19.628
- It should've been you!
- Wh-What?

07:19.663 --> 07:22.178
It took her, but it should
have been you, Lars!

07:22.213 --> 07:24.009
Whoa!
H-Hold on, Ronaldo.

07:24.077 --> 07:28.180
<i>Lars.</i>

07:32.352 --> 07:35.487
- Hey! Let go!
- Wait! Stop!

07:35.555 --> 07:37.990
What are you doing?

07:38.091 --> 07:43.028
Spirit, I deliver the package
of darkness!

07:43.096 --> 07:46.796
Return to us the innocent Sadie!

07:46.797 --> 07:49.263
<i>Lars!</i>

07:49.298 --> 07:51.970
C-Come on, man.
We used to be friends.

07:52.038 --> 07:55.107
And you threw me away!

07:55.208 --> 07:57.609
- Lars!
- No, Steven!

07:57.677 --> 08:00.779
- He's not worth it!
- Why does everything bad

08:00.880 --> 08:04.749
happen to me?

08:15.895 --> 08:18.530
<i>Sadie!</i>

08:18.598 --> 08:23.469
It's a gem.

08:23.536 --> 08:29.007
<i>This is the perfect clubhouse
for the Beach City explorer club!</i>

08:29.109 --> 08:31.110
<i>Secret clubhouse, right, Ronny?</i>

08:31.177 --> 08:33.261
<i>Zip!</i>

08:37.951 --> 08:41.553
<i>Lars, you're a riot!</i>

08:41.621 --> 08:45.891
<i>- Dude!
- Just carving our names in!</i>

08:45.959 --> 08:50.496
<i>Pretty metal, huh?</i>

08:50.563 --> 08:53.298
<i>Weird.</i>

08:52.299 --> 08:57.068
<i>Holy smokes!</i>

08:57.103 --> 08:59.104
<i>The clubhouse is possessed!</i>

08:59.205 --> 09:02.141
<i>Lars! Lars!
When you turn on the TV</i>

09:02.208 --> 09:05.544
<i>tomorrow, this is what's
gonna be on every station!</i>

09:05.612 --> 09:08.814
<i>B-B-But ... but you
said this was secret.</i>

09:08.882 --> 09:11.283
<i>Our first paranormal discovery!</i>

09:11.351 --> 09:15.454
<i>We're gonna take on the world together!</i>

09:15.522 --> 09:20.359
<i>Um... let me just ...
uh, I'll just, uh...</i>

09:20.426 --> 09:24.325
<i>No!
What are you doing?!</i>

09:24.360 --> 09:27.280
<i>- No, no, no, no, no!
- I'm just tearing myself out.</i>

09:27.315 --> 09:29.501
<i>Stop!</i>

09:29.569 --> 09:33.138
<i>Let me... see!</i>

09:33.206 --> 09:35.948
<i>What did you do?
Oh!</i>

09:35.983 --> 09:38.277
<i>Oh, come on.
Ronny, know I can't let </i>

09:38.378 --> 09:40.245
<i>- people see me like that.
- What?!</i>

09:40.313 --> 09:41.764
<i>What's the matter with you?!</i>

09:41.765 --> 09:44.983
<i>Don't you know how important
this was?!</i>

09:48.321 --> 09:51.156
<i>Why do you care so much about</i>

09:51.224 --> 09:54.259
<i>- what other people think?!
- You wouldn't say that if you</i>

09:54.327 --> 09:57.429
<i>knew what other people say about you!</i>

10:04.103 --> 10:06.271
<i>Lars?</i>

10:08.508 --> 10:11.952
Okay, shh. I've got you.

10:11.987 --> 10:15.731
When you were stuck in the wall,
was the house like your body?

10:15.732 --> 10:17.349
You must have felt like you were

10:17.417 --> 10:20.185
under attack, back when
carved his Lars carved

10:20.253 --> 10:23.589
- his name in you.
- Can I see that?

10:23.656 --> 10:28.961
Uh, sorry.
We should let it rest.

10:29.062 --> 10:33.465
So, all that lashing out was
just from feeling hurt

10:33.533 --> 10:37.928
- and trapped for so long.
- I didn't mean to rip it up, okay?

10:37.963 --> 10:39.438
You can stop talking

10:39.505 --> 10:41.540
- about me now.
- Wait!

10:41.641 --> 10:45.911
- Oh, Sadie, are you okay?
- Uh, yeah. I'm fine.

10:46.012 --> 10:47.246
Oh, yeah.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.882
We were both worried about ...

10:49.883 --> 10:52.451
I mean, I ran down here faster.

10:52.518 --> 10:55.887
- Can we get out of here?
- Sadie, you can

10:55.955 --> 10:58.257
come with me.
I think these two have

10:58.324 --> 11:00.604
- a lot to talk about.
- I bet.

11:00.639 --> 11:02.951
I wasn't trying to make you
look bad.

11:02.986 --> 11:04.802
Ah, whatever.
It didn't matter.

11:04.837 --> 11:07.309
- I don't care!
- Hey, Lars...

11:07.344 --> 11:09.923
take it down a notch.
