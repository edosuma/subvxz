00:02.419 --> 00:05.004
Mystic Falls. I was born here.

00:05.463 --> 00:08.132
- This is my home.
- And mine.

00:08.425 --> 00:09.508
And mine.

00:09.718 --> 00:12.803
For centuries, supernatural creatures
have lived among us.

00:13.096 --> 00:15.472
There are vampires.
Werewolves. DoppelgÃ¤ngers.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.099
- Witches.
- Even hybrids.

00:17.308 --> 00:18.851
There are those who protect them.

00:19.060 --> 00:21.228
The sheriff has a vampire for a daughter.

00:21.438 --> 00:25.441
And our lovely mayor, a son who is
half-vampire, half-werewolf.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.151
And those who want them dead.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.820
- They're our friends.
- Our enemies.

00:30.071 --> 00:31.280
The ones we love.

00:32.656 --> 00:34.783
And the ones we've lost.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.119
Matt, look out.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.247
And then there's me.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.959
I'm human.

00:46.963 --> 00:48.005
At least, I was.

01:13.990 --> 01:15.115
Stefan?

01:15.366 --> 01:17.701
Hey. I'm right here.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.162
You've been in and out for hours.

01:20.830 --> 01:22.498
What happened?

01:24.334 --> 01:25.834
You were in an accident.

01:26.753 --> 01:30.547
- Oh, my God. Matt, is he...?
- Alive?

01:32.300 --> 01:34.927
Ask Stefan. The hero.

01:36.679 --> 01:37.721
He's fine.

01:38.431 --> 01:44.311
Thank you. I thought that I...
How did you?

01:44.521 --> 01:47.022
Save you? He didn't.

01:48.358 --> 01:51.568
When Jeremy brought you to the hospital
before all this happened...

01:52.028 --> 01:54.404
...your injuries were worse
than anyone knew.

01:56.241 --> 01:59.660
Meredith Fell made a choice.
She used Damon's blood to heal you.

01:59.869 --> 02:04.581
When Rebekah ran Matt's truck off the road,
you had vampire blood in your system.

02:06.584 --> 02:08.418
Oh, my God.

02:09.878 --> 02:12.172
Does that mean that I...

02:13.675 --> 02:15.050
Am I dead?

02:16.970 --> 02:21.723
No. No.
No, that wasn't supposed to happen.

02:21.933 --> 02:25.394
Maybe it doesn't have to. I talked to Bonnie,
she's stronger than ever.

02:25.603 --> 02:27.896
- There may be something she can do.
- All that will help...

02:28.106 --> 02:30.065
...is for you to feed
and complete the transition.

02:30.275 --> 02:32.192
We have all day before she has to feed.

02:32.402 --> 02:35.696
- A day to exhaust every possible way out.
- There is no way out of it.

02:35.905 --> 02:40.701
We all know the drill. You feed or you die.
There is no door number three.

02:41.202 --> 02:42.578
I was ready to die.

02:44.080 --> 02:48.417
I was supposed to die. I don't want to be...
I can't be a vampire.

02:49.919 --> 02:52.546
If there's something Bonnie can do,
we have to try.

02:52.755 --> 02:54.673
We will. We'll try everything.

02:56.384 --> 03:00.387
Your choice, Elena. As always.

03:15.153 --> 03:18.238
Way to get her hopes up for something that's
never happened in history.

03:18.448 --> 03:21.909
You weren't there when Elena told me
she absolutely never wanted this.

03:22.118 --> 03:23.577
You shouldn't have let her die.

03:23.786 --> 03:26.580
I never meant for that.
She asked me to help Matt first.

03:26.789 --> 03:30.083
And now the world
has one more quarterback.

03:30.793 --> 03:32.169
Bravo, brother.

03:33.963 --> 03:37.966
I made a choice that I will regret
for the rest of my life.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.136
Now let me try to fix it.

04:10.333 --> 04:11.833
Jer.

04:17.173 --> 04:20.341
Are you okay?
I watched Vicki go through this.

04:20.551 --> 04:23.011
She was a mess.
Her emotions were all over the place.

04:23.429 --> 04:25.639
All these old memories came flooding back.

04:25.848 --> 04:27.516
I'm fine. I'm not Vicki.

04:27.767 --> 04:32.479
No, you're you. You act like everything's
okay so no one worries about you.

04:32.689 --> 04:36.233
- But you need help.
- I said I'm fine, okay?

04:37.652 --> 04:39.152
I'm sorry.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.823
- Have you talked to Bonnie?
- Yeah.

04:43.032 --> 04:46.159
When I was shot, she pleaded
to the witch spirits to bring me back.

04:46.369 --> 04:49.079
- And they listened.
- The consequences were horrible.

04:49.372 --> 04:51.790
More horrible than
you turning into a vampire?

04:53.167 --> 04:56.920
I need my sister.
Not another one of them.

04:58.881 --> 05:03.385
We're going to find a way out of this.
Everything's gonna be okay.

05:03.594 --> 05:05.178
I hope so.

05:23.114 --> 05:24.573
It's beautiful, isn't it?

05:26.326 --> 05:27.743
What is that doing here?

05:27.952 --> 05:30.120
The deal we made with Tyler
was you'd leave his body...

05:30.330 --> 05:31.788
...and jump into someone else's.

05:32.081 --> 05:34.624
Yes, when I assumed
I'd be a pile of ash.

05:34.917 --> 05:38.128
But apparently fate and oxygen
intervened, and there I am.

05:38.921 --> 05:40.922
- Put me back.
- I can't right now.

05:41.716 --> 05:44.593
Your history teacher outed Tyler
and Caroline to the Council.

05:44.802 --> 05:46.636
They're on a warpath
and this body's vulnerable.

05:46.846 --> 05:50.223
- I have to help Elena before she has to feed.
- She's dead. Not my concern.

05:50.433 --> 05:54.728
- You're forgetting who saved your life.
- You're forgetting I can rip your tongue out.

05:54.937 --> 05:57.564
Now put me back.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.776
If I can keep Elena human, you'll have
an endless blood supply...

06:00.985 --> 06:03.528
...to make your hybrids.
Isn't that what you want?

06:11.829 --> 06:16.958
Same rules apply. No one knows.
No one. Do you understand me, Bonnie?

06:25.468 --> 06:27.844
Pastor Young,
to what do we owe the honor?

06:28.054 --> 06:31.598
- Don't tell me it's your blood pressure again.
- Honestly, I wish it were.

06:31.808 --> 06:34.434
Blood bank's in the basement.
One of you sweep the rooms.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.937
- What are you doing?
- Adding security measures.

06:37.146 --> 06:39.272
The blood here
has a habit of flying off the shelves.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.400
- Who gave you that authority?
- The Council.

06:41.609 --> 06:45.570
They've entrusted me to secure the town.
Unlike some of our founding families...

06:45.780 --> 06:48.865
...I don't have conflicting interests.
- What's that mean?

06:49.075 --> 06:53.328
Alaric Saltzman told us everything.
Probably time to start looking for a new job.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.333
Elena doesn't wanna be a vampire.

06:58.543 --> 07:01.002
She doesn't want to be dead.
And now she's not.

07:01.295 --> 07:03.880
- This isn't your fault, Matt.
- It's all my fault.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.842
I was driving. I was saved.
She's a vampire because of me.

07:07.051 --> 07:11.179
Shh. Cool it on the V-word. I'm a fugitive.
I'm supposed to be halfway to Florida.

07:11.389 --> 07:14.182
If the Council's after you,
why are you here?

07:14.892 --> 07:16.935
Because I don't know where to go.

07:18.396 --> 07:21.356
Tyler's dead. Everything's different now.

07:30.950 --> 07:35.036
- Can I help you?
- Sorry.

07:36.747 --> 07:38.915
All good here.

07:44.213 --> 07:45.255
What's going on?

07:45.465 --> 07:47.048
We need to ask you about your son.

07:47.258 --> 07:50.635
- You can't arrest me. I'm the mayor.
- Not anymore you're not.

07:51.888 --> 07:54.222
Sorry, Liz.
You're not going to work today.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.224
What are you talking about?

07:57.310 --> 07:58.351
What's going on?

07:58.561 --> 08:02.147
They're taking your badge.
You're not fit to protect us anymore.

08:03.107 --> 08:06.568
- You have no idea what you're up against.
- On the contrary, Liz.

08:06.777 --> 08:09.196
I've taken your deputies.
Got the town's vervain supply.

08:09.405 --> 08:11.781
Including a stash
found at the Salvatore house.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.533
We're making our move.

08:17.413 --> 08:18.455
Mom. Hey.

08:18.664 --> 08:20.957
Where are you? Tell me it's far away.

08:21.167 --> 08:25.295
Where am I? Good question.
Uh, just a whole lot of boring highways.

08:25.796 --> 08:27.297
Why? Is everything okay?

08:28.758 --> 08:30.550
Caroline, what's going on?

08:45.107 --> 08:47.359
- It's disgusting.
- No, it's, um...

08:47.777 --> 08:50.987
- Disgusting.
- Yeah, I'm gonna puke.

08:55.660 --> 09:00.163
I never thought I'd be saying this,
but I can't stop thinking about blood.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.084
I should have saved you first.

09:04.293 --> 09:08.213
- You shouldn't be going through this.
- If you had saved me, Matt would be dead.

09:08.422 --> 09:10.507
What do you think
I'd be going through then?

09:13.094 --> 09:16.596
Stefan, listen to me.
You did the right thing.

09:16.889 --> 09:19.266
You did what you always do,
you respected my choice.

09:19.475 --> 09:21.768
What do I do if Bonnie
can't figure a way to help?

09:21.978 --> 09:25.188
Because then you'll have another choice,
either let yourself die...

09:25.398 --> 09:28.942
...or be a vampire.
- We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

09:30.278 --> 09:36.157
Heh. Oh, my God.
Did I just say cross that bridge?

09:40.037 --> 09:43.790
You're laughing. I'm pretty sure
you don't actually think that's funny.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.002
Ha-ha-ha. I can't stop.

09:47.628 --> 09:50.672
Your emotions are a bit
heightened today.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.552
A lot heightened.

10:00.891 --> 10:02.851
Hey. Shh.

10:05.855 --> 10:09.024
It's okay. It's okay.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.526
I'm sorry, I...

10:13.487 --> 10:14.821
Listen to me.

10:16.032 --> 10:19.367
No matter what happens,
I'm here for you.

10:20.077 --> 10:21.453
I can help you.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.205
Yeah.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.880
Why don't you go back upstairs
where it's dark?

10:32.715 --> 10:34.466
I'll clean up.

10:51.192 --> 10:54.194
- I thought you left.
- Cute p.j.'s.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.405
I'm tired, Damon.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.290
I brought you this.

11:07.917 --> 11:11.086
I thought that was gone. Thank you.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.517
I just have to say something.

11:25.726 --> 11:28.019
Why do you have to say it
with my necklace?

11:28.270 --> 11:30.271
Because what I'm about to say is...

11:31.565 --> 11:34.734
...probably the most selfish thing
I've ever said in my life.

11:36.153 --> 11:37.821
Damon, don't go there.

11:38.030 --> 11:41.783
I just have to say it once.
You just need to hear it.

11:43.077 --> 11:44.744
I love you, Elena.

11:45.830 --> 11:51.584
And it's because I love you
that I can't be selfish with you.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.797
That's why you can't know this.

11:57.633 --> 11:59.467
I don't deserve you.

12:03.931 --> 12:05.306
But my brother does.

12:20.072 --> 12:22.657
God, I wish you didn't have to forget this.

12:25.453 --> 12:27.495
But you do.

13:06.702 --> 13:09.120
You should know better
than to sneak up on a lady.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.539
Good advice. Have you seen one?

13:13.334 --> 13:15.710
Tragic about Elena.

13:16.337 --> 13:20.548
Not to make a gray cloud grayer, but
does Matt even have automobile insurance?

13:53.290 --> 13:54.541
Stefan?

13:55.543 --> 13:56.876
Elena, don't move.

14:09.139 --> 14:11.432
Ah, you incessant woman.

14:12.601 --> 14:16.771
- Hey, Mom. What's up?
- Tyler, thank God. Are you okay?

14:16.981 --> 14:18.731
Fine, why? What's going on?

14:18.941 --> 14:20.859
Pastor Young had me
arrested this morning.

14:21.068 --> 14:22.944
The Council grilled me
on your whereabouts.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.864
Don't tell me where you are.
The less I know the better.

14:26.073 --> 14:28.408
Mom, I'm okay. Relax.

14:28.617 --> 14:31.828
You didn't answer your phone.
I was scared you were with Caroline.

14:32.204 --> 14:34.956
Why? What happened to Caroline?

14:36.125 --> 14:39.669
- The Council took her.
- What do you mean they took her?

14:54.351 --> 14:55.768
Vervain ropes.

14:57.479 --> 14:59.731
Looks like Alaric outed us all
to the Council.

14:59.982 --> 15:03.735
The Council? What exactly do
they think they can do to me?

15:12.620 --> 15:13.953
What the hell happened?

15:23.047 --> 15:26.049
- Tyler?
- I'm harder to kill than you think.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.303
You're alive?

15:31.263 --> 15:35.350
- How are you alive?
- No time. Come on, we gotta go.

15:37.686 --> 15:39.187
Wait. What about me?

15:40.189 --> 15:42.357
Keep them busy, little sister.

15:44.693 --> 15:47.362
No. That's not possible.

15:55.371 --> 15:58.289
They're gone.
Whoever nailed Rebekah took them too.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.583
Please tell me you have something.
Anything.

16:00.793 --> 16:05.380
I can't. The Council locked Carol and me
out of our offices, files, computers, everything.

16:05.673 --> 16:10.009
So the mayor and the sheriff
never contemplated a back-up plan, Liz?

16:10.219 --> 16:11.469
Damon, relax.

16:11.679 --> 16:14.847
When Caroline called, did she know
where they were taking her?

16:15.057 --> 16:18.226
No, she was in some van in the middle
of nowhere and managed to escape.

16:18.435 --> 16:20.812
Perfect.
We've narrowed it down to nowhere.

16:23.065 --> 16:25.400
Hey. Is Elena here?

16:28.070 --> 16:31.114
In what world are you the one
that gets to live?

16:31.323 --> 16:34.867
- Damon, stop. It wasn't his fault.
- Let him go, Damon. Now.

16:46.422 --> 16:47.922
Still wanna be a writer?

16:49.341 --> 16:53.261
I remember how you'd read your
stories to my daughter when you'd babysit.

16:54.471 --> 16:56.556
She still loves writing
because of you.

16:56.765 --> 17:00.143
- Why did you bring me here?
- My deputies can watch out for us here.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.270
No vampires have been invited in.

17:03.230 --> 17:06.065
Elena, I know it sounds crazy,
but years ago...

17:06.275 --> 17:09.944
...it was your parents who were advocating
having an emergency plan like this.

17:10.154 --> 17:13.156
Never thought
we'd actually have to use it. Elena?

17:14.575 --> 17:15.907
Elena, are you okay?

17:16.952 --> 17:18.661
Where's Stefan?

17:19.163 --> 17:21.122
Where he can't hurt you.

17:21.623 --> 17:24.959
He would never hurt me. You have
no idea what you're talking about.

17:25.252 --> 17:28.963
I know that wherever you go,
Salvatore vampires seem to follow.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.968
- You hungry?
- No.

17:36.972 --> 17:42.643
So we'll hold Stefan until Damon comes
searching for you two.

17:43.312 --> 17:47.148
Then we'll use Rebekah
to lure her siblings back into town.

17:47.483 --> 17:49.192
You'll give us the White Oak Stake.

17:49.401 --> 17:54.489
And then we will exterminate
the entire vampire race for good.

18:00.788 --> 18:04.707
Something wrong? Elena, you okay?

18:05.501 --> 18:06.626
Yeah.

18:17.679 --> 18:19.847
No, I've gotta get out of here.

18:25.854 --> 18:27.313
Get her!

18:44.373 --> 18:48.209
I never thought I'd see you again.
I don't get it. How are you alive?

18:48.418 --> 18:51.087
This is going to sound incredible, but...

19:04.101 --> 19:08.062
Easy, love. Wrong time, wrong place,
wrong equipment.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.982
You're miraculously alive.
We're fugitives on the run.

19:11.191 --> 19:13.693
All signs
point to hot hybrid vampire sex.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.911
Did you just call me "love"?

19:25.706 --> 19:28.666
I don't know, love. Did I?

19:31.044 --> 19:34.297
- What the hell did you do to Tyler?
- That's what I enjoy about you.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.757
So much more than a pretty face.

19:37.009 --> 19:40.344
Oh, my God, you're Klaus.
You're disgusting.

19:40.554 --> 19:42.597
And you're a glorious kisser.

19:44.308 --> 19:47.685
Listen. I didn't have to risk
exposure to come save you.

19:47.936 --> 19:53.816
Oh. You do one semi-decent thing and you're
my hero? Ugh, I need to sanitize my mouth.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.569
Your mouth was all over me.
I was an innocent victim.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.863
- Put Tyler back.
- Gladly.

19:59.156 --> 20:02.950
Then maybe I'll take you up
on your offer of hot hybrid sex.

20:23.931 --> 20:26.974
- Spirits aren't listening.
- Is that it? Is that all we can do?

20:29.686 --> 20:33.814
- There's something else I could try.
- What? Do it.

20:35.776 --> 20:38.236
If the witches won't help me save Elena...

20:38.445 --> 20:40.947
...maybe I can go to the Other Side
and bring her back.

20:41.156 --> 20:44.242
- The Other Side is for dead people.
- She's still in transition.

20:44.451 --> 20:47.745
Not fully dead or fully alive.
What if her spirit exists on both sides?

20:47.955 --> 20:51.707
Even if it does, how can you get there?
You're not dead.

20:52.751 --> 20:53.834
No. No, Bonnie.

20:54.044 --> 20:57.505
I was able to stop your heart to stop Klaus'.
I'll do the same to myself.

20:57.714 --> 21:02.051
Witches have free rein on the Other Side.
I will find Elena and bring her back with me.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.679
- Assuming you wake up.
- I'm stronger now.

21:04.888 --> 21:07.473
- I found a new source of power.
- A new source of power?

21:07.683 --> 21:11.519
What power is gonna let you kill yourself
and bring someone back from the dead?

21:12.646 --> 21:15.231
Do you want Elena back or not?

21:17.818 --> 21:20.194
With vervain and weapons,
they could be anywhere.

21:20.404 --> 21:21.904
Come on, guys, think.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.739
It takes a lot to hold a vampire.

21:23.949 --> 21:28.077
- Reinforced steel, iron doors.
- The pastor has a cattle ranch.

21:29.162 --> 21:30.579
Those pens could be modified.

21:31.748 --> 21:33.874
It's remote, it's secluded.

21:36.086 --> 21:37.586
Well, guess what.

21:37.796 --> 21:40.756
Looks like you get a chance
to prove how sorry you really are.

21:40.966 --> 21:43.009
Let's go.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.869
I thought I killed you.

22:10.704 --> 22:11.787
Where am I?

22:11.997 --> 22:14.790
They thought you were a vampire
so they stuck you with us.

22:16.251 --> 22:20.129
- Where's Stefan?
- Elena, I'm right here. Are you okay?

22:20.756 --> 22:22.465
Stefan...

22:24.217 --> 22:25.676
I didn't feed.

22:26.970 --> 22:28.054
Ah.

22:28.263 --> 22:29.597
I see what's going on here.

22:31.308 --> 22:34.602
You died with vampire blood
in your system and you didn't feed.

22:34.811 --> 22:38.481
And now you're locked up in here
without a drop of human blood in sight.

22:38.690 --> 22:40.066
That is a problem.

22:41.318 --> 22:42.360
Just ignore her.

22:42.569 --> 22:44.445
Has anyone done the math or shall I?

22:44.654 --> 22:51.660
I'd say you've got less than three hours
before I get to watch you die all over again.

22:55.248 --> 22:57.416
My day just got a whole lot better.

23:23.902 --> 23:24.944
Oh, my God.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.408
Bonnie. Bonnie, open your eyes.

23:33.078 --> 23:35.496
I can't let you do this.

23:37.290 --> 23:39.166
You're dying.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.046
What the hell is that?

23:45.674 --> 23:47.758
Bonnie, no!

23:49.177 --> 23:51.303
Bonnie. Bonnie, wake up.

23:51.513 --> 23:53.139
Bonnie, wake up!

24:01.231 --> 24:02.440
Elena.

24:08.947 --> 24:10.573
Come back.

24:10.782 --> 24:13.159
Come back, Elena.

24:24.838 --> 24:25.921
Stefan.

24:27.674 --> 24:29.425
Stefan, something's happening.

24:31.761 --> 24:33.012
We're going home.

24:37.392 --> 24:39.101
No.

24:46.526 --> 24:48.736
Grams? What are you doing?

24:48.945 --> 24:50.488
You can't be in here.

24:50.697 --> 24:54.158
- You stay away from this sort of darkness.
- Elena needs me.

24:54.367 --> 24:57.203
She is not your problem to solve.
Now go.

24:57.412 --> 24:59.205
Before they try to keep you here.

24:59.414 --> 25:01.248
Grams, please.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.292
This magic is dark, Bonnie.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.085
It is not nature's plan.

25:05.295 --> 25:10.174
Touch it again and the spirits will unleash
their anger in ways that will make you suffer.

25:10.383 --> 25:12.635
Stay away.

25:13.595 --> 25:15.262
Go!

25:15.472 --> 25:17.515
Bonnie, wake up. Wake up!

25:17.724 --> 25:20.768
Come on. Open your eyes.

25:24.147 --> 25:26.190
Hey. You're awake.

25:27.150 --> 25:28.817
You're alive.

25:29.361 --> 25:31.403
I couldn't do it.

25:34.157 --> 25:35.950
It didn't work.

25:40.038 --> 25:41.121
Stefan?

25:41.331 --> 25:42.373
What happened?

25:43.416 --> 25:44.917
I'm out of time.

25:45.585 --> 25:46.752
I need blood.

25:48.547 --> 25:49.964
I'm dying.

25:55.428 --> 25:57.388
Hey!

25:59.474 --> 26:01.642
Anyone. Hey!

26:01.851 --> 26:04.436
Will you shut up?

26:05.480 --> 26:07.106
Do you think we're afraid of you?

26:13.113 --> 26:14.363
You want more vervain?

26:14.573 --> 26:16.073
Keep it down.

26:16.283 --> 26:17.366
Listen to me.

26:18.243 --> 26:20.286
Elena's gonna die if you don't let her out.

26:23.164 --> 26:25.457
Sorry. Not my problem.

26:26.293 --> 26:27.918
She's innocent. Let her out.

26:34.467 --> 26:35.634
Stop.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.012
I said let her out!

26:52.944 --> 26:54.737
She said she's not strong enough.

26:54.946 --> 26:57.489
You put me in here,
you're strong enough to get me out.

26:57.699 --> 27:00.618
I upset the spirits to save Elena.
I can't use that magic.

27:00.827 --> 27:02.953
- It's too dangerous.
- Do the bloody spell.

27:03.163 --> 27:04.496
She said she can't, okay?

27:05.624 --> 27:10.502
We'll just wait until you're strong enough to
do it with traditional magic. Right, Bonnie?

27:23.058 --> 27:24.642
- Aah!
- What are you doing?

27:24.851 --> 27:28.646
Ripping Tyler's heart out.
I'll jump into someone else. Maybe you.

27:29.981 --> 27:31.357
- Oh, my God.
- Stop. Stop.

27:31.566 --> 27:35.986
- He's bluffing. He needs a witch to do that.
- You think I don't have one? Or 10?

27:36.196 --> 27:37.237
Pick, Bonnie.

27:38.156 --> 27:39.490
You or Tyler.

27:40.825 --> 27:43.327
- Stop. Please. You're killing him.
- Fine, I'll do it.

27:44.037 --> 27:45.829
Just stop.

27:49.542 --> 27:51.168
Good.

27:52.962 --> 27:54.213
Let's begin.

28:17.570 --> 28:19.071
Elena?

28:19.280 --> 28:21.740
You still with me?

28:23.201 --> 28:27.371
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

28:28.123 --> 28:29.873
I'm okay.

28:30.083 --> 28:32.292
No, you're not.

28:32.502 --> 28:34.503
I can hear your breathing.

28:40.719 --> 28:43.679
Damon was right.

28:43.888 --> 28:46.765
You should have fed this morning.

28:47.809 --> 28:49.518
I'm so sorry.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.229
Don't be.

28:52.439 --> 28:55.149
You had hope.

28:55.734 --> 29:01.238
That's all I ever wanted you to have,
and you had it.

29:03.783 --> 29:06.410
I love you so much.

29:09.456 --> 29:12.499
Do you know why
I was even on that bridge?

29:15.962 --> 29:18.464
I was coming back for you, Stefan.

29:20.842 --> 29:26.138
I had to choose, and I picked you.

29:29.142 --> 29:30.809
Because I love you.

29:34.355 --> 29:37.107
No matter what happens...

29:39.319 --> 29:42.654
...it's the best choice I ever made.

29:46.117 --> 29:48.076
God.

29:48.286 --> 29:51.163
It sucks that I can't see you right now.

29:52.957 --> 29:55.667
I'm smiling.

29:58.004 --> 29:59.630
Me too.

30:25.490 --> 30:28.283
So, what, we just storm the place
with zero weapons?

30:28.493 --> 30:30.160
Nah. We don't need weapons.

30:30.370 --> 30:31.537
Just bait.

30:41.881 --> 30:43.090
Yoo-hoo.

30:43.299 --> 30:44.591
Anybody home?

30:44.801 --> 30:46.927
There's a big, bad vampire out here.

30:52.559 --> 30:54.935
Let him go. The boy's innocent.

30:56.396 --> 30:57.521
That's the point.

30:57.730 --> 31:00.482
Give me Stefan and Elena
and he's all yours.

31:01.943 --> 31:04.778
Come on, pastor. You know I'll kill him.

31:04.988 --> 31:06.864
- I want to kill him.
- Go away.

31:07.073 --> 31:09.575
You are not invited in.
And I'm not coming out.

31:16.916 --> 31:18.959
This is black magic.
She shouldn't do this.

31:29.470 --> 31:31.138
Tyler.

31:33.766 --> 31:35.809
Caroline.

31:36.019 --> 31:37.436
Hey.

31:39.606 --> 31:41.315
Tyler.

31:41.524 --> 31:43.108
Bonnie, what are you doing?

31:45.278 --> 31:49.406
I warned you, child.
I warned you to stay away.

31:49.616 --> 31:50.991
Bonnie, it worked. Stop.

31:51.784 --> 31:53.660
- What's happening?
- Let me go.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.662
- I can't.
- Let me go.

31:55.872 --> 31:57.164
Bonnie, what's happening?

32:02.253 --> 32:04.338
- Why can't I let go?
- Bonnie, stop the spell.

32:04.547 --> 32:05.672
You made your choice.

32:05.882 --> 32:07.633
Now they're taking it out on me.

32:12.013 --> 32:13.263
I'm sorry, Grams.

32:13.473 --> 32:17.434
- You can't do this. Please. Don't do this to her!
- Aah!

32:17.644 --> 32:20.979
- Bonnie, stop.
- No! No! Oh, my God!

32:22.982 --> 32:27.277
- What have I done? What did I do?
- You're okay. You're okay.

32:27.487 --> 32:31.156
What did I do? What did I do?

32:45.505 --> 32:48.006
I got this. Bring the other one in.

32:51.928 --> 32:54.805
Excuse me? Hello, sir?

32:58.601 --> 33:00.102
Thought I told you to shut up.

33:00.311 --> 33:03.313
Here's the thing.
My family, we have money.

33:03.523 --> 33:07.192
Castles, apartments, jewelry.
Just name your price and let me out.

33:10.238 --> 33:12.698
I'd much rather watch you die.

33:26.754 --> 33:28.714
Elena. Elena.

35:00.848 --> 35:01.932
Go ahead and kill me.

35:02.141 --> 35:04.601
You can't possibly hate me
more than I hate myself.

35:04.811 --> 35:05.852
Oh, yes, I can.

35:07.647 --> 35:08.855
It should have been you.

35:12.985 --> 35:14.736
Leave him alone.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.091
Just stop.

35:36.300 --> 35:37.676
Stop saving me.

35:37.885 --> 35:41.138
- What's your problem?
- What do you want me to say, thank you?

35:41.347 --> 35:43.807
Because honestly,
I wish you'd just let me drown.

35:44.016 --> 35:48.311
- What, you think you were my first choice?
- Elena's a vampire because of me.

35:48.521 --> 35:50.772
I have to live with that the rest of my life.

35:50.982 --> 35:53.942
You don't have to live with that.
You get to live with that.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.153
Because Elena put your life
before her own.

35:56.362 --> 36:01.408
So every morning you get out of bed
you sure as hell better earn it.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.622
- You were gonna kill him.
- Yep. Guy just won't die.

36:07.832 --> 36:10.542
It was my choice to save him.
Why aren't you seeing that?

36:10.751 --> 36:14.087
It's a little hard to keep track
of all your choices lately, Elena.

36:16.716 --> 36:18.091
I remember everything.

36:23.431 --> 36:26.099
One of the highlights of my transition?

36:27.894 --> 36:32.230
Remembering everything
that you compelled me to forget.

36:33.274 --> 36:34.774
Like how you and I met first.

36:36.861 --> 36:41.239
You were a stranger that told me you wanted
me to get everything I wanted from life.

36:42.742 --> 36:44.868
Damon, why didn't you tell me?

36:45.077 --> 36:47.495
Would it have made a difference?

36:50.374 --> 36:51.416
Didn't think so.

36:51.626 --> 36:54.252
You asked me to make a choice, Damon,
so I did.

36:54.462 --> 36:59.758
If you're gonna be mad, take it out on me,
not on Stefan, or Matt, or anyone else. Me.

36:59.967 --> 37:01.384
Are we done here?

37:01.594 --> 37:05.680
If it had been you at the bridge last night,
and not Stefan...

37:05.890 --> 37:07.891
...and I begged you to save Matt...

37:08.100 --> 37:10.602
I would have saved you in a heartbeat.
No question.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.939
That's what I thought.

37:14.148 --> 37:18.068
And Matt would be dead
because you couldn't let go.

37:18.277 --> 37:20.570
- Matt would be dead.
- But you wouldn't be.

37:22.156 --> 37:24.783
You would've gotten to grow up,
have the life you wanted.

37:24.992 --> 37:26.034
The life you deserved.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.787
And I know I didn't used to get that,
but I do now.

37:28.996 --> 37:30.956
And I wanted that for you, Elena.

37:31.165 --> 37:36.836
And I would have gladly have given it to you
and let Matt die, because I am that selfish.

37:37.672 --> 37:39.631
But you knew that already.

37:42.927 --> 37:45.971
The first night we met is not all
that you remember.

38:04.031 --> 38:05.824
How dare you save Caroline over me?

38:06.033 --> 38:08.994
Hello, brother. I thought you were dead.
So pleased you're not.

38:09.203 --> 38:10.370
You left me.

38:10.579 --> 38:12.664
I had time to save one,
you can't be killed.

38:12.873 --> 38:14.833
Rest assured, I had a worse day than you.

38:15.042 --> 38:17.752
It's time for us to move on.
Find some more werewolves.

38:17.962 --> 38:21.089
Create your hybrid family?
You don't know anything about family.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.967
I know how easily they can be silenced
with a dagger.

38:24.635 --> 38:26.011
No!

38:28.889 --> 38:30.974
- Drop them.
- I mourned you.

38:31.183 --> 38:35.353
- My heart broke thinking I'd never see you.
- Put the blood down, Rebekah. Good girl.

38:35.563 --> 38:37.105
It's always been me.

38:37.315 --> 38:41.276
Not Finn, not Elijah, not Kol. Me.

38:41.485 --> 38:43.862
I loved you through everything
and you don't care.

38:44.071 --> 38:46.072
- Drop it!
- You want your family?

38:46.907 --> 38:47.949
Here's your family.

38:50.911 --> 38:53.496
Rebekah, you're right. I don't care.

38:53.706 --> 38:57.834
From this moment on, you're not my family,
you're not my sister.

38:58.044 --> 39:00.837
You are nothing.

39:10.389 --> 39:13.641
The whole Council
knows who we are now.

39:13.851 --> 39:16.644
Everything's about to change.

39:17.605 --> 39:21.066
Yeah, I'm sure Damon
has a revenge plan cooked up.

39:23.569 --> 39:25.820
We'll figure out a way to deal with it.

39:26.030 --> 39:29.741
Stefan, you don't have to convince me
that everything's gonna be okay.

39:31.744 --> 39:33.620
I know.

39:34.288 --> 39:36.122
Wish I could, though.

39:36.957 --> 39:40.418
I wish I could just tell you
that you'll never feel pain...

39:40.961 --> 39:43.671
...that you'll never crave blood.

39:44.882 --> 39:45.965
But you will.

39:49.595 --> 39:52.430
It'll be the worst thing
that you've ever lived through.

39:54.975 --> 39:56.726
But I'll get to live.

39:57.978 --> 40:01.398
I'll be a sister, and a friend...

40:02.566 --> 40:03.775
...and I'll be with you.

40:05.569 --> 40:08.822
Forever, if I want.

40:16.497 --> 40:18.289
I'm gonna get through this.

40:18.499 --> 40:21.459
Just like we get through everything.
One day at a time.

40:25.214 --> 40:27.966
We should get inside before sunrise.

40:28.175 --> 40:30.844
Bonnie made this for you yesterday.

40:35.808 --> 40:37.267
Just in case.

40:37.476 --> 40:39.185
Daylight ring?

40:47.987 --> 40:51.364
One day at a time. Right?

41:19.685 --> 41:22.020
Folks, by now you know
the vampires have escaped.

41:26.150 --> 41:27.942
Here you go. Thanks for coming.

41:28.152 --> 41:30.403
And it won't be long before they retaliate.

41:33.240 --> 41:34.782
But fear not.

41:37.161 --> 41:39.204
I have been chosen
to lead us in a movement.

41:39.413 --> 41:42.332
- What are you talking about?
- Hear me, loved ones.

41:42.541 --> 41:45.585
Soon you'll be free
to pass through the gates...

41:47.046 --> 41:48.880
...and we'll all reunite in eternity.

41:49.089 --> 41:51.049
Seriously, pastor, what's going on here?

41:51.258 --> 41:52.759
Friends...

41:53.594 --> 41:55.053
...we are the beginning.
