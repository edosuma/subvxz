01:17.877 --> 01:19.745
<i>When I was a kid...</i>

01:20.280 --> 01:23.315
<i>...I used to think about the kind
of man I'd grow up to be.</i>

01:51.611 --> 01:55.214
<i>I never thought my life
would turn out this way.</i>

02:18.772 --> 02:20.774
So you're Chris Redfield.

02:21.424 --> 02:23.410
The expert on the living dead.

02:23.510 --> 02:25.345
The big hero.

02:26.746 --> 02:28.549
Bet you killed a lot, huh?

02:29.399 --> 02:32.636
So, Mr. Expert,
any advice on dealing with them?

02:34.437 --> 02:35.840
Yeah.

02:37.306 --> 02:39.142
You got friends?

02:39.542 --> 02:41.744
Sure. I got friends.

02:41.844 --> 02:44.938
- Family?
- Yeah. Got a wife.

02:45.038 --> 02:47.884
My folks. A little sister.

02:49.619 --> 02:52.990
There's corporations out there
creating viruses...

02:54.040 --> 02:56.043
...turning people into bioweapons.

02:56.693 --> 02:58.495
People like you and me.

02:58.795 --> 03:01.465
Your friends. Family.

03:02.365 --> 03:05.302
There will come a day
when you'll be faced with a decision.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.136
Kill them...

03:07.236 --> 03:09.039
...or be killed.

03:09.839 --> 03:12.242
Doesn't sound very heroic, does it?

03:18.448 --> 03:19.716
Sorry.

03:22.785 --> 03:25.628
We're approaching the target, so let's
go over everything one more time...

03:25.728 --> 03:27.609
...so there's no mistakes.

03:28.892 --> 03:33.196
The target is Glenn Arias. He's wanted
internationally for weapons trafficking.

03:33.496 --> 03:36.265
And we're not talking about
M16s and IEDs here.

03:36.365 --> 03:38.268
We're talking cutting-edge shit.

03:38.368 --> 03:41.704
He likes doing business
anywhere there's a major conflict.

03:41.804 --> 03:45.375
Intel says that Arias is now
in possession of a B.O.W....

03:45.875 --> 03:48.912
...a.k.a. bioorganic weapon.

03:49.612 --> 03:53.283
That's why the BSAA is here.
They know how to handle those things.

03:54.584 --> 03:58.162
One of our undercover agents, Cathy White,
went missing weeks ago...

03:58.262 --> 04:01.741
...along with her son, Zack.
We have two objectives today...

04:01.841 --> 04:05.545
...find them and grab Glenn Arias.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.243
Comm check.

04:53.643 --> 04:55.845
<i>No movement outside the compound.</i>

04:55.945 --> 04:59.149
Split up into three teams. We're going in.

05:32.381 --> 05:33.850
Clear.

08:12.541 --> 08:13.943
Jesus.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.830
Are you okay?

09:19.141 --> 09:20.443
Go!

10:42.358 --> 10:45.361
- Zack?
- Yeah.

10:48.047 --> 10:49.515
Go!

11:49.558 --> 11:51.427
Redfield, come in.

11:53.362 --> 11:55.965
Anybody. What the hell's going on?

12:03.339 --> 12:05.839
Emergency evac. Get the chopper now.

12:26.028 --> 12:27.863
Get out of here!

13:50.379 --> 13:52.247
Arias.

14:51.407 --> 14:54.257
Thanks to you, I'll have to move
my business somewhere else.

14:55.477 --> 14:58.247
You son of a bitch.

14:58.347 --> 14:59.749
Please.

15:00.649 --> 15:02.486
I'm a businessman.

15:03.986 --> 15:07.657
I make good products available
to anyone who wants to buy.

15:08.357 --> 15:10.193
And at reasonable prices.

15:11.393 --> 15:13.963
For example, this...

15:14.063 --> 15:16.098
...exquisite specimen.

15:29.341 --> 15:30.746
Cathy.

15:31.847 --> 15:33.128
Bastard.

15:34.316 --> 15:38.224
The last moments on Earth are
the most beautiful, don't you think?

15:57.656 --> 15:59.658
The wonderful thing about my products...

15:59.758 --> 16:03.628
...is that they know the difference
between ally and enemy.

17:50.686 --> 17:52.775
Congratulations!

19:03.225 --> 19:04.737
No!

19:37.426 --> 19:40.062
This is all for you, my dear.

19:43.966 --> 19:45.768
My Sara.

20:24.339 --> 20:26.175
Is that it?

20:26.445 --> 20:29.092
Is that the virus
that's making everyone flip out?

20:29.711 --> 20:31.134
Yes.

20:32.180 --> 20:36.452
It keeps getting worse and worse.
Attacks are happening all over the place.

20:38.587 --> 20:42.124
Where'd you get this?
I haven't seen this footage before.

20:42.224 --> 20:44.307
It hasn't been released yet.

20:44.593 --> 20:46.662
They don't want the public to panic.

20:47.362 --> 20:51.367
Are you kidding me? There's been
like 20 attacks in the U.S. already.

20:51.967 --> 20:54.703
The BSAA is working
to keep it under control, but...

20:54.803 --> 20:59.374
But it'll just keep happening until we
find the cause and stop it, right?

20:59.474 --> 21:00.977
Exactly.

21:01.877 --> 21:03.912
This is being done intentionally.

21:04.212 --> 21:06.615
If we can just find out who's behind it...

21:07.015 --> 21:10.552
Caramel macchiato?
Did you remember the chocolate chips?

21:10.652 --> 21:13.856
- And the whipped cream on top.
- Good boy.

21:13.956 --> 21:16.825
That's dessert, not coffee.
You know that, right?

21:16.925 --> 21:18.727
Your point?

21:19.761 --> 21:22.931
Nothing. Nothing at all, Professor Chambers.

21:31.156 --> 21:35.000
The dead coming back to life
and being used as bioweapons.

21:36.705 --> 21:40.601
These insane corporations have caused
far too much tragedy in this country.

21:41.116 --> 21:43.385
You think this is more of the same, then?

21:43.785 --> 21:45.420
I don't know.

21:45.520 --> 21:47.623
Based on what's happened before...

21:47.723 --> 21:49.820
...this time it feels different.

21:50.425 --> 21:52.477
Someone new could be behind it.

21:53.829 --> 21:56.064
Is that the vaccine simulation?

21:57.532 --> 22:00.402
The infected are exhibiting
different traits this time around.

22:00.502 --> 22:02.704
I'm attempting to suppress
the artificial virus...

22:02.804 --> 22:05.607
...because it seems to be
the base of the infection.

22:05.707 --> 22:08.710
I saw the computational
chemistry system running.

22:08.810 --> 22:11.614
- Are we making a test drug already?
- Of course.

22:11.714 --> 22:15.751
Our technology's come so far over the years,
making a sample doesn't take that long.

22:17.619 --> 22:19.721
Oh, by the way...

22:19.821 --> 22:22.458
...we got another delivery
of infected bodies.

22:23.058 --> 22:25.594
A lot. More than 30.

22:25.694 --> 22:29.575
- Who's getting the samples?
- The students are all out today.

22:30.365 --> 22:31.733
And...

22:31.833 --> 22:35.487
Oh, no. I'm postdoc. I don't do that.

22:37.906 --> 22:42.144
Fine. Anything you say, Professor Chambers.

22:44.279 --> 22:46.081
My hero.

23:21.466 --> 23:23.334
What the...

26:59.517 --> 27:01.001
Aaron.

27:01.669 --> 27:03.105
No.

28:08.169 --> 28:10.605
Why? Why now?

28:10.705 --> 28:12.307
Here?

28:13.708 --> 28:15.577
It's like it was planned.

30:45.743 --> 30:47.162
Rebecca.

30:47.862 --> 30:50.245
- Chris?
- You all right?

31:06.347 --> 31:08.149
It's been a while.

31:09.701 --> 31:13.004
You should be wearing
a clean-suit or at least a mask.

31:13.654 --> 31:15.490
Yeah, well...

31:15.790 --> 31:17.659
How you doing?

31:18.926 --> 31:20.996
I'm fine for now.

31:21.596 --> 31:23.665
But shouldn't I be in quarantine?

31:25.750 --> 31:27.235
Look...

31:27.705 --> 31:31.526
...if the virus really was that contagious,
we'd all be dead already.

31:32.707 --> 31:36.144
Besides, quarantine takes too long,
and I need you now.

31:37.344 --> 31:41.214
So don't worry. We'll get you to a hot
shower, and everything will be okay.

31:43.518 --> 31:45.537
Same old Chris.

31:48.456 --> 31:51.660
<i>According to police reports,
the suspects were armed terrorists.</i>

31:52.060 --> 31:54.296
<i>So far, the number of dead
is reported to be over...</i>

31:54.396 --> 31:58.236
<i>The mass killing that occurred in this town
just outside of Chicago is still...</i>

31:58.336 --> 32:03.338
<i>Sudden outbreak of violence
claimed dozens of victims today.</i>

32:03.438 --> 32:07.818
<i>Ontario's special task force has
declared the situation under control.</i>

32:07.918 --> 32:11.045
<i>While that might be the official
statement on the incident...</i>

32:11.145 --> 32:12.947
It's me.

32:21.256 --> 32:23.344
That doesn't look like you're resting.

32:24.359 --> 32:26.194
A hot shower does wonders.

32:29.364 --> 32:31.427
Is that the data you took from the lab?

32:31.527 --> 32:33.004
Yes.

32:33.104 --> 32:35.603
And now that we know
the test drug works as a vaccine...

32:35.703 --> 32:38.539
...we have to send this out
to other labs ASAP.

32:38.639 --> 32:42.444
The faster we get this mass-produced,
the more lives we can save.

32:42.844 --> 32:45.013
Yeah, maybe.

32:46.731 --> 32:48.650
There's a reason you're here, isn't there?

32:49.450 --> 32:51.286
You're after someone.

32:51.726 --> 32:54.509
Yeah, a man named Glenn Arias.

32:55.189 --> 32:56.924
Who's that?

32:57.024 --> 32:59.894
He took over Neo Umbrella
and Tricell's operations.

32:59.994 --> 33:04.299
And now he's selling the weapons they created
to crime syndicates and countries at war.

33:04.399 --> 33:06.434
He's a merchant of death...

33:06.534 --> 33:09.764
...using mercenaries and B.O.W.s
to do his dirty work.

33:09.864 --> 33:11.739
And now...

33:12.039 --> 33:13.882
...the dead are rising again.

33:14.942 --> 33:17.445
And you're sure Arias is behind it?

33:17.545 --> 33:19.040
Yes.

33:19.140 --> 33:21.926
After I found out that your research
was the most advanced in the world...

33:22.026 --> 33:25.083
You hopped on a chopper and came to see me.

33:25.183 --> 33:26.621
Yes.

33:26.721 --> 33:29.057
And after I saw how trashed your lab was...

33:29.157 --> 33:32.427
...it looks like the bad guys
knew about your research too.

33:33.362 --> 33:36.564
I reported our initial findings to the WHO.

33:36.664 --> 33:39.147
And then they sent it to facilities
all over the world...

33:39.247 --> 33:41.436
...that specialize in the development
of vaccines.

33:41.536 --> 33:44.139
The leak could've come
from any of those places.

33:44.239 --> 33:47.809
- Exactly.
- Arias wanted to disrupt your research.

33:47.909 --> 33:51.112
And now that he's got your data,
he's even more dangerous.

33:54.215 --> 33:58.420
I compared the new virus's DNA
to all the bioweapons we have on file.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.923
The sequence is extremely close
to the parasitic weapons...

34:02.023 --> 34:04.427
...used by the Los Iluminados cult.

34:05.927 --> 34:08.163
You think Arias might be one of 'em?

34:08.263 --> 34:11.516
Based on information I have now,
I'm not sure.

34:14.668 --> 34:17.304
Looks like we should go talk
to a real expert.

34:17.605 --> 34:19.407
Real expert?

34:34.722 --> 34:37.725
I can't believe you can read
a book at a time like this.

34:40.360 --> 34:42.597
I guess it's one way to pass the time.

34:43.665 --> 34:47.228
Well, someone once said,
"Knowledge is power."

34:47.768 --> 34:49.402
Francis Bacon.

34:51.505 --> 34:54.743
It only takes one bullet
to bring your enemy down.

34:55.443 --> 34:58.847
But with knowledge, you can defeat all evil.

35:01.382 --> 35:04.185
Hey, is it true what they say?

35:04.485 --> 35:07.649
You switched from special ops
to science geek?

35:09.591 --> 35:13.895
Man, the BSAA's chock-full
of people with weird rÃ©sumÃ©s.

35:13.995 --> 35:16.465
Bet you were pretty brainy to start with.

35:17.165 --> 35:19.634
So why'd you switch?

35:20.134 --> 35:21.970
That's a story.

35:23.070 --> 35:25.634
I used to be a medic
in the S.T.A.R.S. Unit...

35:25.734 --> 35:27.742
...in Raccoon City.

35:27.842 --> 35:31.379
I guess, in a way, I've always been
interested in medical science.

35:31.479 --> 35:35.484
Then one day, I decided to make it
my duty to stop people from abusing it.

35:36.584 --> 35:42.123
<i>I thought, "Here are these corporations,
run by scum, preying on the weak."</i>

35:42.223 --> 35:45.026
<i>They're like a disease on humanity.</i>

35:45.126 --> 35:47.895
<i>I want to find a cure, same as Chris.</i>

35:47.995 --> 35:52.633
<i>The difference is, he uses
his brawn while I use my brain.</i>

35:52.733 --> 35:56.003
So brains and brawns working
together to save humanity.

35:56.103 --> 35:58.453
What do you think your chances are?

35:58.673 --> 36:00.613
<i>What's that supposed to mean, Damian?</i>

36:00.713 --> 36:04.746
Nothing. It's just, like,
what if this disease don't got no cure?

36:05.546 --> 36:09.083
The assholes we're after,
they treat life and death...

36:09.183 --> 36:10.918
...like they shooting craps.

36:11.018 --> 36:12.740
Bunch of dicks.

36:12.920 --> 36:18.075
Hey, I just realized D.C. and Damian aren't
talking about <i>Breaking Bad</i> for once.

36:18.175 --> 36:21.432
- Hey, don't go there, Chris.
- Yo, that shit's ahead of its time.

36:21.532 --> 36:23.431
It's a goddamn masterpiece.

36:57.264 --> 36:59.501
Careful you don't scare the locals.

37:00.001 --> 37:02.036
Your stealth's for shit.

37:02.136 --> 37:05.139
It's a little early to be
that deep in the bottle, Leon.

37:07.274 --> 37:09.110
Well, look who it is.

37:09.210 --> 37:12.614
The BSAA's golden boy and Dr. High Hopes.

37:13.214 --> 37:16.124
- What the hell do you want?
- I got a job.

37:16.224 --> 37:18.052
We need your help.

37:19.620 --> 37:21.422
I'm on vacation.

37:23.057 --> 37:25.293
Let's talk about Los Iluminados.

37:26.261 --> 37:28.796
Remember the type of B.O.W.s they were using?

37:29.396 --> 37:31.833
That's so long ago, I don't remember.

37:32.333 --> 37:35.803
So what, you just gonna sit around
here another week and do nothing?

37:35.903 --> 37:38.307
I never make plans that far ahead.

37:39.507 --> 37:43.077
- Hey. Another bottle here.
- Cancel that.

37:43.177 --> 37:46.380
- Hey, who the hell do you...
- Enough! All right?

37:47.648 --> 37:50.720
What do you want, Redfield?

37:51.352 --> 37:53.793
What do you want, Leon?

37:57.458 --> 38:00.308
- Cut the shit.
- Guys, come on.

38:00.828 --> 38:04.599
Leon... I'm sorry to interrupt
your vacation...

38:04.699 --> 38:07.168
...but we wouldn't be here
if it wasn't serious.

38:07.268 --> 38:10.938
We think you might have some intel,
and we need it now.

38:14.375 --> 38:16.177
What intel?

38:30.391 --> 38:32.394
<i>Second target confirmed.</i>

38:33.995 --> 38:36.064
She stays alive.

38:36.764 --> 38:38.499
Finish the rest.

38:38.599 --> 38:40.235
<i>Copy that.</i>

38:53.881 --> 38:55.917
Look, this shit's spreading fast and thick.

38:56.017 --> 39:00.287
All of the researchers and staff
at my university were infected.

39:02.189 --> 39:04.025
This again, huh?

39:04.425 --> 39:06.594
It's like I'm stuck in a goddamn loop.

39:06.694 --> 39:08.964
- What?
- What are you talking about?

39:10.064 --> 39:12.348
You know that bomb that went off in D.C.?

39:13.034 --> 39:15.903
Well, it was my mission
to stop the terrorists.

39:16.938 --> 39:21.342
We got to our rendezvous point
and some asshole ratted us out.

39:23.277 --> 39:26.380
<i>The bomb went off
and everyone on Metro SWAT...</i>

39:26.480 --> 39:28.788
<i>...my whole unit, gone.</i>

39:30.051 --> 39:33.721
<i>I keep fighting and fighting, and fighting.</i>

39:33.821 --> 39:37.492
<i>And instead of seeing an end to this shit,
it just keeps getting worse.</i>

39:38.392 --> 39:40.661
Is this what my life's supposed to be?

39:42.113 --> 39:45.183
Fighting the living dead
and the bastards that make 'em?

39:45.783 --> 39:47.552
What's the point of it all?

39:47.652 --> 39:49.064
Look...

39:49.837 --> 39:52.406
...this is Glenn Arias, an arms dealer.

39:52.506 --> 39:54.675
His deals on the black market are so shady...

39:54.775 --> 39:57.344
...they landed him
on a certain government's hit list.

39:58.079 --> 40:00.381
<i>A smart bomb was dropped on his wedding.</i>

40:00.481 --> 40:02.884
<i>He lost his family and his wife.</i>

40:02.984 --> 40:05.723
<i>And now he's got a grudge.</i>

40:05.823 --> 40:08.289
<i>After the attack, he went underground...</i>

40:08.389 --> 40:12.460
<i>...but now he's back with B.O.W.s
and a score to settle.</i>

40:12.560 --> 40:16.761
<i>Here's the kicker... he said his products
have targeting capabilities.</i>

40:18.099 --> 40:21.222
<i>From what I've seen, I believe him.</i>

40:24.038 --> 40:26.373
So you got an arms dealer on one side...

40:26.473 --> 40:31.512
...and on the other, a government
dropping bombs on weddings.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.549
- Who's the bad guy here?
- Arias!

40:34.649 --> 40:38.352
- And it's our mission to bring his ass down!
- Your mission, not mine!

40:38.452 --> 40:40.557
- Goddamn it, Leon!
- Stop!

40:40.657 --> 40:43.166
Leon. With everything that's going on...

40:43.266 --> 40:46.093
...you just sit here
and feel sorry for yourself.

40:46.193 --> 40:50.064
And you? You're letting
a grudge get the better of you.

40:51.365 --> 40:55.169
God... I cannot believe
how alike you two are.

40:55.919 --> 40:56.937
What are you talking about?

40:57.037 --> 41:00.074
You're acting like a couple
of selfish brats right now.

41:17.391 --> 41:20.194
The virus is right under our noses.

41:20.294 --> 41:21.729
Always has been.

41:23.564 --> 41:25.262
I don't follow.

41:25.362 --> 41:29.804
We don't need to look for some new virus
that Arias is infecting people with.

41:30.504 --> 41:34.341
The virus is lying dormant
inside of everyone.

41:34.441 --> 41:36.310
Even you.

41:36.410 --> 41:38.846
What we need to find is the trigger.

41:39.346 --> 41:43.985
Something activates the latent virus,
and only Arias knows what it is.

41:44.385 --> 41:50.245
But until we find that out, everyone,
living and dead, are his potential weapons.

41:50.991 --> 41:54.629
If we don't figure this out right now, there
won't be quaint little towns like this...

41:54.729 --> 41:58.476
...for you to drink your
sorrows away in ever again.

42:00.067 --> 42:04.481
I created a vaccine,
and I tried it on myself and it works.

42:04.771 --> 42:08.244
But until we find out
how Arias triggers the virus...

42:08.344 --> 42:11.345
...who knows if it'll work
the same for everyone else.

42:13.113 --> 42:15.549
My blood holds the answers.

42:17.101 --> 42:21.005
If I die, get this to a lab you trust.

42:25.592 --> 42:28.495
I can't imagine what you
two have been through.

42:28.595 --> 42:31.799
But I know that neither one
of you are the type of person...

42:31.899 --> 42:34.902
...who would sit here and argue
while the world dies.

42:36.403 --> 42:38.239
That's not who you are.

42:40.507 --> 42:42.343
Or is it?

43:02.129 --> 43:04.131
That wasn't very nice of me.

43:55.615 --> 43:56.851
Leon!

43:58.018 --> 43:59.093
Patricio!

43:59.193 --> 44:01.480
- Wait, wait! Let me explain.
- Leon!

44:01.580 --> 44:04.663
You know that guy I was telling you about.
The one that sold out my unit.

44:04.763 --> 44:06.360
You don't understand.

44:06.460 --> 44:09.530
- This is the guy.
- Please, stop.

44:10.030 --> 44:13.100
- Hey! What do you think...
- Official business. It's okay.

44:13.200 --> 44:15.670
- Leon, come on!
- What do you want?

44:15.970 --> 44:19.340
Please. You're the only one
I know from the DSO.

44:19.440 --> 44:22.590
It's my family. You've got to save them.

44:22.690 --> 44:24.245
What?

44:25.246 --> 44:28.515
My wife and my daughter are in Spain.

44:28.615 --> 44:30.985
An arms dealer is getting paid...

44:31.085 --> 44:34.088
...by the surviving members of Los Iluminados

44:34.188 --> 44:37.945
...to launch a large-scale bioterror attack.

44:38.045 --> 44:41.295
I know too much.
They're going to kill me and my family.

44:43.364 --> 44:46.133
Did you hear what he said?
It's our lucky day.

44:46.233 --> 44:48.769
"Lucky"? Are you crazy?

44:48.879 --> 44:52.062
- He's gonna lead us right to our guy.
- What the hell are you talking about?

44:52.162 --> 44:54.375
The name Glenn Arias ring a bell?

44:54.475 --> 44:57.512
- How do you know?
- I'm psychic.

44:58.412 --> 45:01.081
I need your help! My family!

45:01.381 --> 45:03.217
Let me get this straight.

45:03.317 --> 45:07.388
You try and get me killed, and now
I'm supposed to save your family?

45:08.288 --> 45:11.492
Well, how about this?
You tell us what you know first...

45:11.592 --> 45:14.195
...and then we'll decide if we help.

45:55.252 --> 45:57.140
Son of a bitch!

45:57.905 --> 45:59.773
He was followed!

46:04.211 --> 46:05.946
This is my family.

46:06.046 --> 46:08.883
Please. Save them.

46:15.422 --> 46:17.124
Damn it.

46:24.498 --> 46:26.067
Rebecca!

46:30.204 --> 46:33.274
Target one down. Target two secured.

46:48.122 --> 46:52.192
D.C., they hit us at the hotel
and took Rebecca. Track 'em.

46:52.660 --> 46:56.664
- I know the big guy. He's with Arias.
- What's Arias want with Rebecca?

46:57.164 --> 47:00.268
I don't know. I just want to get her back.

47:01.168 --> 47:04.371
There goes my vacation. Again.

47:21.321 --> 47:23.790
<i>Hi, honey, it's me.</i>

47:23.890 --> 47:26.627
<i>Were you able to get the man
you said would help?</i>

47:28.895 --> 47:32.700
<i>I'm so scared. Selena misses her daddy.</i>

47:33.800 --> 47:36.170
- <i>Patricio? Hello?</i>
- <i>Can I talk to Papa?</i>

47:36.270 --> 47:40.874
- <i>Patricio? Who is this?</i>
- <i>MamÃ¡? Can I talk to Papa? Please.</i>

47:40.974 --> 47:44.844
<i>Where's Patricio?
Put my husband on the phone right...</i>

47:48.148 --> 47:50.984
There's a reason he gave that
to you before he died.

47:51.719 --> 47:54.088
It might have the answers we need in it.

47:56.423 --> 47:58.425
We have Rebecca's laptop.

47:58.525 --> 48:00.394
We have leads.

48:01.795 --> 48:05.065
Look, man, I need you.

49:24.344 --> 49:27.088
I succeeded in reanimating them, but...

49:27.188 --> 49:30.817
...I haven't figured out how to keep
the bodies from rotting away...

49:31.417 --> 49:32.720
...yet.

49:32.820 --> 49:34.822
Practice makes perfect.

49:36.123 --> 49:38.125
Meet my guests.

49:38.225 --> 49:41.028
My family and some of my dearest friends.

49:45.766 --> 49:48.169
Professor Rebecca Chambers.

49:48.669 --> 49:50.070
Welcome.

49:51.638 --> 49:53.474
I'm Glenn Arias.

49:54.875 --> 49:58.412
I heard you found a cure for my merchandise.

50:01.748 --> 50:05.252
For someone so young, you're quite brilliant.

50:07.721 --> 50:09.924
A cure isn't the only thing I found.

50:10.424 --> 50:11.892
Really?

50:13.093 --> 50:15.696
Please, tell me more.

50:17.497 --> 50:20.641
I figured out how
the latent virus is activated.

50:20.744 --> 50:24.638
Animality Virus, Professor.
A-Virus, for short.

50:27.207 --> 50:30.510
Your B.O.W.s can tell
who they're supposed to attack.

50:30.610 --> 50:33.247
That's a good selling point for a weapon.

50:33.747 --> 50:37.117
Engineering them with that trait
must have been difficult for you.

50:37.217 --> 50:39.253
But I know how you did it.

50:39.753 --> 50:42.190
There are three strains of the virus.

50:43.240 --> 50:45.709
One infects them.

50:46.059 --> 50:48.663
A second acts as a trigger.

50:49.363 --> 50:53.534
The third gives you the option
of choosing who your target will be.

50:54.334 --> 50:57.171
<i>A sort of inactivation virus.</i>

50:57.771 --> 50:59.606
<i>The vaccine...</i>

51:02.576 --> 51:04.411
Bring up the map again.

51:06.413 --> 51:09.029
She must have thought
these outbreaks were related.

51:09.129 --> 51:11.618
See how they're all concentrated
around the Great Lakes?

51:11.718 --> 51:16.023
If what she said is true, and this thing
can lay dormant inside people...

51:17.323 --> 51:19.560
...God knows how many are infected.

51:22.062 --> 51:24.615
<i>You mixed the base virus in drinking water.</i>

51:24.965 --> 51:26.933
I'm impressed.

51:27.033 --> 51:29.069
How did you figure it out?

51:29.869 --> 51:33.240
I noticed a huge concentration
of outbreaks around the Great Lakes.

51:33.740 --> 51:37.616
<i>Which just so happens to be
a major source of drinking water.</i>

51:38.228 --> 51:41.895
But they weren't planned by you.
They happened by accident.

51:42.415 --> 51:44.581
<i>It seems under certain rare conditions...</i>

51:44.681 --> 51:48.555
<i>...the latent virus can activate
without the trigger virus.</i>

51:49.355 --> 51:53.524
Speaking of, the trigger virus is
probably distributed through the air...

51:54.761 --> 51:56.611
<i>...by a gas.</i>

51:57.264 --> 52:00.500
By themselves, these viruses
either have no potency...

52:00.600 --> 52:03.003
...or they run the risk
of activating on their own.

52:03.303 --> 52:06.738
But when combined,
they become an effective...

52:06.838 --> 52:09.894
...controllable bioweapon.

52:10.427 --> 52:12.463
Nicely done, Professor.

52:13.413 --> 52:16.237
It's no wonder you survived Raccoon City.

52:19.053 --> 52:23.857
If the trigger's airborne, it's harder
to control where it goes or who gets it.

52:25.292 --> 52:28.895
So then Arias has to be using
some type of vaccine.

52:30.697 --> 52:32.999
That's how he controls
the spread of an outbreak.

52:33.099 --> 52:36.136
He vaccinates anyone
he doesn't want infected first.

52:36.236 --> 52:39.239
Which makes for a more accurate weapon. See?

52:46.913 --> 52:49.382
You've done your homework on the A-Virus.

52:50.717 --> 52:52.919
So now what's next?

52:54.120 --> 52:56.990
It wasn't hard for me
to engineer a test cure.

52:57.090 --> 53:01.562
And now that I know it works,
my team has my research and my blood.

53:02.262 --> 53:04.664
Your "merchandise," as you put it...

53:04.764 --> 53:07.567
...will soon be obsolete on the marketplace.

53:08.869 --> 53:13.139
I hate to say this,
but your research is incomplete.

53:14.508 --> 53:18.312
If you had found the cure, you wouldn't
have been attacked after you took it.

53:19.880 --> 53:22.349
But you were, weren't you?

53:24.250 --> 53:26.053
Not that it matters.

53:26.953 --> 53:30.423
No, you and your vaccine
will soon be out of time.

53:31.725 --> 53:34.728
Tomorrow, the world will be
a different place.

53:38.832 --> 53:40.868
Arias is planning something big.

53:41.518 --> 53:43.467
Patricio knew way too much about it.

53:44.571 --> 53:46.807
And that's why he was killed.

53:54.548 --> 53:56.421
I know what happened.

53:56.983 --> 53:59.119
They came to kill you...

53:59.219 --> 54:02.088
...but killed everyone you loved instead.

54:03.790 --> 54:05.792
It was your wedding day.

54:09.529 --> 54:11.799
The day time stopped for me.

54:22.642 --> 54:24.469
That's Sara...

54:25.545 --> 54:27.433
...my wife.

54:32.653 --> 54:35.255
You look so much like her.

54:41.027 --> 54:43.464
It's not a coincidence that we met.

54:45.331 --> 54:47.134
It's fate.

54:49.402 --> 54:50.871
Wait.

54:57.777 --> 54:59.846
Where are you going with this?

55:08.321 --> 55:10.390
I'm redoing the wedding.

55:14.728 --> 55:17.830
This time... with you.

55:21.301 --> 55:23.169
I'll rewrite the past.

55:30.043 --> 55:31.536
Rebecca...

55:33.479 --> 55:35.465
...meet Sara.

55:43.923 --> 55:45.992
We're going to be so happy.

56:11.217 --> 56:13.053
On second thought...

56:16.422 --> 56:21.227
...I'm going to replace your arm with Sara's.

56:24.397 --> 56:26.967
Maybe that will change your mind about me.

56:35.141 --> 56:37.811
He's gonna use the trigger virus on New York?

56:37.911 --> 56:41.381
- That's what it looks like.
- He's out of his mind.

56:43.750 --> 56:46.419
"If the outbreak is deemed uncontrollable...

56:46.519 --> 56:50.427
...tanks labeled with a green A contain
the vaccine and are ready to deploy.

56:50.857 --> 56:52.659
Location classified."

56:55.361 --> 56:58.769
All we have to do is find that stuff,
and we can change everyone back.

56:59.299 --> 57:01.335
Like flipping a safety switch.

57:02.285 --> 57:05.889
But if you were Arias,
where would you keep it?

57:06.339 --> 57:10.143
Someplace he can get to fast.
Someplace secure.

57:11.978 --> 57:13.980
His hideout in New York.

57:16.049 --> 57:18.318
And I bet we'll find Rebecca there too.

57:24.324 --> 57:27.961
- We need to expedite the release.
- <i>We're set for morning rush hour.</i>

57:28.061 --> 57:32.497
I have a feeling the BSAA will be heading
our way, so we need that countermeasure.

57:34.267 --> 57:36.503
You're planning another attack.

57:37.103 --> 57:39.105
I'm planning our future.

57:39.505 --> 57:41.975
Our time starts now.

57:42.842 --> 57:45.311
- "Our"?
- Yes.

57:47.613 --> 57:50.083
With the last of my remaining friends...

57:50.483 --> 57:53.354
...we will begin our new life together.

58:06.866 --> 58:08.734
It's time.

58:09.903 --> 58:11.304
Dad...

58:28.655 --> 58:30.857
...wish me luck.

01:00:29.008 --> 01:00:30.543
Oh, my God.

01:00:30.643 --> 01:00:32.912
Alex! Alex!

01:00:33.913 --> 01:00:35.749
I'll call the ambulance.

01:00:38.284 --> 01:00:40.286
Not now, goddamn it.

01:01:41.247 --> 01:01:43.916
Everybody get a dose of Rebecca's vaccine?

01:01:45.385 --> 01:01:46.820
Good.

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:49.356
What's the status on the reinforcements?

01:01:50.490 --> 01:01:53.760
BSAA and N.Y.P.D. SWAT
are on the ground in the thick of it.

01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:57.130
The state police won't get there
for another three hours.

01:01:57.230 --> 01:02:00.299
So that means we have
to nab Arias all by ourselves.

01:02:00.399 --> 01:02:01.968
Fantastic.

01:02:02.168 --> 01:02:05.038
Yo! The signal's getting worse.

01:02:09.442 --> 01:02:12.011
They're using tanker trucks
to spray the virus.

01:02:12.111 --> 01:02:14.548
He's not trying to turn a couple thousand.

01:02:14.948 --> 01:02:16.716
He's trying to turn them all.

01:02:16.816 --> 01:02:19.085
We need to take out those tankers.

01:02:19.685 --> 01:02:22.489
Professor Chambers' research says
the virus can't handle heat.

01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:25.245
It's got the same flash point as gasoline.

01:02:25.345 --> 01:02:29.196
Perfect. Let's light a match, watch it burn.

01:02:30.296 --> 01:02:34.234
I wish we could get to Rebecca first,
but the priority is those tankers.

01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:38.133
Alright, so we got three things to do.
One, blow up the tankers.

01:02:38.233 --> 01:02:42.699
Two, get Rebecca. Three, grab
the vaccine and deploy it on the city.

01:02:42.799 --> 01:02:46.362
- And grab Arias. Four things.
- Whatever you say, boss.

01:02:46.512 --> 01:02:49.949
D.C., Nadia, you guys work from the Osprey.

01:02:50.049 --> 01:02:51.918
Roger that, C.

01:03:04.997 --> 01:03:07.367
Gifts from the BSAA.

01:03:07.467 --> 01:03:10.503
They said that's the best
they can do for us for now.

01:03:17.276 --> 01:03:19.078
Dibs on the bike.

01:03:25.551 --> 01:03:28.388
<i>Once the tankers are down,
rendezvous at Arias' place.</i>

01:03:28.488 --> 01:03:31.038
<i>Depending on the situation, we might
have to put Rebecca on hold...</i>

01:03:31.138 --> 01:03:33.993
- <i>...until we find that vaccine.</i>
- Got it.

01:04:06.092 --> 01:04:08.561
Well, you ready to rock?

01:04:08.861 --> 01:04:10.697
Are you kidding?

01:04:11.197 --> 01:04:12.999
Let's do this.

01:05:08.521 --> 01:05:11.040
Damian! Shit.

01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:15.935
Damn it.

01:05:16.495 --> 01:05:18.131
Any ideas?

01:05:21.667 --> 01:05:24.978
I'll lead the dogs away.
You go blow up some more tankers.

01:05:25.078 --> 01:05:27.907
- Good?
- Yeah.

01:05:28.307 --> 01:05:31.376
Here, boy. Come on!

01:07:18.551 --> 01:07:21.620
This version of the trigger virus
is better than the last.

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:24.724
Stronger. Your blood was the key.

01:07:25.324 --> 01:07:27.127
Thank you so much.

01:07:31.364 --> 01:07:32.409
Unfortunately...

01:07:32.509 --> 01:07:36.769
...increasing the toxicity means it can't
be administered via gas anymore.

01:07:37.169 --> 01:07:40.206
So it's back to the old needle, I'm afraid.

01:07:40.606 --> 01:07:42.441
My apologies.

01:07:44.276 --> 01:07:46.826
If our simulations were correct...

01:07:46.926 --> 01:07:49.943
...it should start working in half an hour.

01:08:27.987 --> 01:08:30.622
Three down. Going for the next one.

01:09:57.142 --> 01:10:01.113
<i>Nice to see you again, Mr. Redfield.</i>

01:10:01.213 --> 01:10:02.748
Arias.

01:10:03.883 --> 01:10:08.087
<i>Thanks to Professor Chambers,
we made the virus much stronger.</i>

01:10:08.787 --> 01:10:11.967
<i>If you can stick around for...
another 20 minutes...</i>

01:10:12.067 --> 01:10:14.115
<i>...you'll see how strong.</i>

01:10:14.693 --> 01:10:18.498
<i>I can't wait for you to meet
the new and improved Rebecca.</i>

01:10:19.098 --> 01:10:20.783
<i>The question is...</i>

01:10:21.333 --> 01:10:23.936
<i>...do you have it in you to kill her?</i>

01:10:27.873 --> 01:10:32.211
My army of the dead will change
the world for the better.

01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:36.048
It will correct the imbalance
caused by recent wars.

01:10:36.348 --> 01:10:40.052
Maybe if you can stay alive long enough,
you can watch with me as my B.O.W.s...

01:10:40.152 --> 01:10:42.755
...bring down the most powerful nations...

01:10:42.855 --> 01:10:46.338
...one by one.

01:10:47.193 --> 01:10:49.362
You belong in a nuthouse, asshole.

01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:53.199
Unfortunately, I'm not crazy.

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.654
I want revenge.

01:11:09.715 --> 01:11:13.152
<i>I'm hitting the reset button on the world.</i>

01:11:13.252 --> 01:11:16.489
<i>And my merchandise, my B.O.W.s...</i>

01:11:16.989 --> 01:11:19.625
<i>...are the right tool for the job.</i>

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:49.982
- Leon.
- Sorry I'm late.

01:12:50.082 --> 01:12:51.917
I had to take the stairs.

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:10.429
Maybe this is what I've always wanted.

01:14:12.598 --> 01:14:14.841
A world in flames...

01:14:16.034 --> 01:14:18.304
...where only the dead remain.

01:14:50.352 --> 01:14:53.605
- Rebecca's running out of time.
- Then let's split up.

01:15:39.452 --> 01:15:40.886
Rebecca.

01:16:37.075 --> 01:16:38.910
You okay?

01:16:40.012 --> 01:16:41.180
Chris.

01:16:46.752 --> 01:16:49.162
No, no, no. Wait, wait.

01:16:49.262 --> 01:16:51.237
Where's the vaccine?

01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:53.725
Tell me!

01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:04.103
You just had to try to save her.

01:17:04.203 --> 01:17:07.706
You're so predictable, Chris.
That's your weakness.

01:17:18.083 --> 01:17:19.584
Shit.

01:20:06.685 --> 01:20:08.253
Rebecca.

01:20:14.059 --> 01:20:17.329
- You have to kill me.
- No.

01:20:17.429 --> 01:20:19.331
We'll find the vaccine.

01:20:19.431 --> 01:20:21.433
Just hang on a little longer.

01:20:50.395 --> 01:20:51.930
Diego...

01:20:52.230 --> 01:20:54.233
...the final stage.

01:20:56.101 --> 01:20:57.934
Unleash it.

01:22:03.935 --> 01:22:05.836
Redfield!

01:24:37.922 --> 01:24:39.789
Found you.

01:25:00.678 --> 01:25:05.149
I'm going to spill your guts all over.

01:25:17.629 --> 01:25:19.062
Nadia!

01:25:40.952 --> 01:25:42.820
Diego!

01:25:56.468 --> 01:25:58.001
Shit.

01:26:46.851 --> 01:26:48.317
Catch.

01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:20.416
Bye-bye, asshole.

01:28:37.829 --> 01:28:39.315
Rebecca?

01:29:18.803 --> 01:29:20.804
One more thing left to do.

01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:24.083
So let's do it.

01:30:43.221 --> 01:30:44.844
<i>When I was a kid...</i>

01:30:46.124 --> 01:30:49.192
<i>...I never thought my life
would turn out this way.</i>

01:30:51.929 --> 01:30:55.732
And once again, we find ourselves
back where we started.

01:30:58.002 --> 01:30:59.871
What do you mean?

01:31:00.371 --> 01:31:02.473
We got the bad guys.

01:31:02.573 --> 01:31:05.041
Hope we made the world a little safer.

01:31:10.915 --> 01:31:13.818
- Hey, Chris.
- Yeah?

01:31:14.218 --> 01:31:17.086
How much longer can we keep
going on like this?

01:31:18.422 --> 01:31:20.289
I don't know.

01:31:22.660 --> 01:31:24.861
I never make plans that far ahead.
