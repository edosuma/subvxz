00:19.573 --> 00:20.661
Risa!

00:20.661 --> 00:21.706
See you!

00:21.706 --> 00:22.663
See you later!

00:38.723 --> 00:39.811
Yeah?

00:41.160 --> 00:42.205
Oh, it's you, Sis.

00:44.990 --> 00:46.644
Change of clothes.

00:46.644 --> 00:48.646
How's your leg?

00:48.646 --> 00:51.388
It's just fine as long as
I don't move it around too much.

00:53.651 --> 00:54.869
You've gotta
be more careful!

00:54.869 --> 00:57.089
Well what about your leg?

00:57.089 --> 00:59.613
So. Are you running?

00:59.613 --> 01:02.051
You just
worry about yourself.

01:02.051 --> 01:03.661
Okay, okay.

01:03.661 --> 01:06.707
Hey, Risa? Heard of the
Wind Festival in Fula City?

01:06.707 --> 01:08.318
Yeah, I've heard of it.
What about it?

01:08.318 --> 01:10.668
It's supposed to
be a really big event.

01:10.668 --> 01:11.756
So...

01:11.756 --> 01:13.018
About that...

01:13.018 --> 01:14.672
I wanna ask you a favor.

01:15.716 --> 01:17.022
Uh...

01:18.110 --> 01:19.590
I'm home...

01:33.256 --> 01:35.606
Me catch a Pokémon?!

01:35.606 --> 01:36.781
No, no WAY!

01:36.781 --> 01:38.522
But Risa! I'm begging you!

01:38.522 --> 01:41.177
Not a chance!
Why are you asking me?

01:41.177 --> 01:43.657
Come on! Would you
take a look at my leg?

01:43.657 --> 01:46.051
What if I went out
and suddenly collapsed?

01:46.051 --> 01:47.748
And nobody was around to help?

01:47.748 --> 01:50.403
I mean, there I am, losing
consciousness, and the only

01:50.403 --> 01:52.449
person I'm thinking about
is my amazing sister!

01:52.449 --> 01:55.626
Is that what you want? Huh?!
I mean how could you?

01:55.626 --> 01:57.149
Okay, I'll try!

01:57.149 --> 01:59.238
But no guarantees!
Got it?

01:59.238 --> 02:00.631
All right!

02:00.631 --> 02:02.981
But I don't expect
you to do it for nothing!

02:02.981 --> 02:04.504
Take it. Here!

02:04.504 --> 02:05.897
What's this for?

02:05.897 --> 02:07.812
Something
to say thank you.

02:07.812 --> 02:10.074
Wear them and have
fun at the festival!

02:10.074 --> 02:12.121
Wow! They're pretty cute!

02:12.121 --> 02:13.992
Not too shabby,
little brother...

02:17.735 --> 02:19.084
Catching a Pokémon...

02:42.325 --> 02:44.327
There will
be an award ceremony for

02:44.327 --> 02:45.893
the winner of the catch race.

02:47.025 --> 02:48.026
All right.

02:48.026 --> 02:49.158
Father!

02:50.071 --> 02:51.725
Morning, Margo!

02:51.725 --> 02:54.206
Are you going to the
Wind Festival today?

02:54.206 --> 02:55.816
You take care then!

02:55.816 --> 02:56.730
You, too, Father!

03:00.604 --> 03:01.561
Yes!

03:36.727 --> 03:39.991
This young man is
Ash Ketchum, from Pallet Town.

03:39.991 --> 03:42.646
With his partner,
Pikachu, he's working hard

03:42.646 --> 03:44.517
to become a Pokémon Master...

03:44.517 --> 03:46.998
So, his
journey continues.

03:46.998 --> 03:49.348
He's arrived
in a city that lives in

03:49.348 --> 03:50.741
harmony with the wind...

03:50.741 --> 03:52.743
Fula City.
And right now...

03:52.743 --> 03:55.833
...the city is
holding its Wind Festival.

03:57.008 --> 03:58.488
Wow, this looks like fun!

04:06.713 --> 04:07.801
Pikachu!

04:09.020 --> 04:10.500
There's even
better stuff over here!

04:12.066 --> 04:14.112
It looked
light and fluffy and yummy!

04:15.592 --> 04:18.072
Hey... Never thought
it would be this lively...

04:19.117 --> 04:21.380
This isn't bad at all!

04:21.380 --> 04:22.816
Not bad at all.

04:24.209 --> 04:26.342
Now look, you,
stay away from me!

04:27.604 --> 04:28.866
Pity's sake.

04:28.866 --> 04:30.476
A lady can't even look
at flowers in peace!

04:30.476 --> 04:32.086
Uh...

04:32.086 --> 04:35.176
Impossible! I mean...
It's tomorrow, right?

04:35.176 --> 04:36.961
No, no, I know, but...

04:36.961 --> 04:38.354
Is everything all right?

04:38.354 --> 04:40.181
Yeah, everything's fine.
Don't touch them.

04:40.181 --> 04:41.444
Now, where was I?

04:41.444 --> 04:43.881
Can't we work something
out here? I mean...

04:43.881 --> 04:45.056
Yeah?

04:47.624 --> 04:49.713
Kellie, are you hurt?

04:49.713 --> 04:50.844
I'm okay!

04:50.844 --> 04:52.150
Watch where you're going!

04:52.150 --> 04:54.283
But this
place is so much fun!

04:54.283 --> 04:55.980
O--kay!

04:55.980 --> 04:58.635
I'll take you
somewhere that's even more fun!

04:58.635 --> 05:00.289
There are
lots of places to play!

05:00.289 --> 05:02.465
I love you,
Uncle Callahan!

05:26.445 --> 05:28.665
The Pokémon Channel!

05:28.665 --> 05:31.232
Here we go!
It's the Pokémon Channel!

05:31.232 --> 05:34.453
Get ready!
This only happens once a year.

05:34.453 --> 05:36.934
We're talking the
Wind Festival in Fula City!

05:36.934 --> 05:40.024
Aww! I wanted to go, too...

05:40.024 --> 05:41.895
If that's what you poor kids

05:41.895 --> 05:44.115
are thinking then I'm your guy!

05:44.115 --> 05:45.899
There's no need to fear!

05:45.899 --> 05:48.902
This channel will bring you
all the news from the festival!

05:48.902 --> 05:51.209
They say
that the festival was formed

05:51.209 --> 05:53.037
after a promise with Lugia!

05:53.037 --> 05:55.213
See,
once this place was a

05:55.213 --> 05:56.693
barren, desolate land!

05:56.693 --> 05:58.521
But
even so, people and Pokémon

05:58.521 --> 06:00.131
supported each other!

06:00.131 --> 06:02.394
Lugia
saw their bonds of friendship

06:02.394 --> 06:05.528
and promised to grant
them the power of wind!

06:05.528 --> 06:06.877
And
the people used that power to

06:06.877 --> 06:09.270
build and develop Fula City!

06:09.270 --> 06:12.186
Ever since,
Lugia comes to town once a year.

06:12.186 --> 06:13.971
After
seeing the bonds of friendship

06:13.971 --> 06:16.539
between people and Pokémon,
it gives them the gift of

06:16.539 --> 06:18.715
the wind for another year!

06:20.151 --> 06:21.718
But wait.

06:21.718 --> 06:24.503
There's one more thing you
should know. A long time ago...

06:24.503 --> 06:26.679
There was
a fire. On a nearby mountain!

06:26.679 --> 06:29.029
But Lugia put it out!

06:31.423 --> 06:32.381
Uncle Callahan?!

06:33.904 --> 06:36.341
See?
I bought some ice cream!

06:36.341 --> 06:38.082
Here!
This one's all for you!

06:38.082 --> 06:39.605
Oh, thank you, Kellie!

06:42.826 --> 06:45.959
Uncle Callahan,
please show me your Pokémon!

06:45.959 --> 06:48.309
Do you have the
strongest Pokémon ever EVER?

06:48.309 --> 06:50.137
Uh, of course I do!

06:50.137 --> 06:51.225
See?

06:51.225 --> 06:52.792
What kind is it?

06:52.792 --> 06:54.577
The strongest kind!

06:54.577 --> 06:55.578
Let me see!

06:55.578 --> 06:56.709
No!!

06:56.709 --> 06:58.319
See,
now's not a good time.

06:58.319 --> 07:01.061
It was just in a giant
battle! And it's exhausted.

07:01.061 --> 07:03.194
Hey, look out!
Your ice cream!

07:03.194 --> 07:05.457
It's dripping!

07:05.457 --> 07:07.720
Thank you.
You're a good brother.

07:07.720 --> 07:10.201
Kellie just had to come,
no matter what.

07:10.201 --> 07:11.594
No prob.

07:11.594 --> 07:14.379
But is she...
Is she up to this?

07:14.379 --> 07:16.947
Yes. She's been
feeling good lately.

07:19.340 --> 07:21.212
Uncle Callahan!?

07:21.212 --> 07:23.649
What kind
of Pokémon is that?

07:23.649 --> 07:27.174
Ah, that's the
Legendary Pokémon Lugia.

07:27.174 --> 07:29.046
Lugia's the
reason this city has grown

07:29.046 --> 07:30.439
to the size it has!

07:30.439 --> 07:33.137
Uncle Callahan,
you know everything!

07:33.137 --> 07:35.400
It happened
long, long ago.

07:35.400 --> 07:37.402
It was a cold day.

07:37.402 --> 07:39.883
I had just
arrived in town for work.

07:39.883 --> 07:41.841
When suddenly--

07:41.841 --> 07:44.975
I began to see a
red glow up on the mountain.

07:44.975 --> 07:48.065
It then occurred to
me that red glow was a fire!

07:48.065 --> 07:49.370
I screamed...

07:49.370 --> 07:51.285
Townspeople,
listen to me!

07:51.285 --> 07:54.463
The fire's
coming closer! Run!

07:54.463 --> 07:57.204
I called for Lugia.
Hoping for help!

07:57.204 --> 08:00.599
And Lugia came and
put out that mountain fire!

08:00.599 --> 08:02.688
Since then,
the town has been living

08:02.688 --> 08:04.560
happily ever after!

08:04.560 --> 08:07.258
The end! Thank you.

08:07.258 --> 08:09.303
Uncle Callahan,
Awesome! Yay!

08:09.303 --> 08:11.088
Yay!

08:11.088 --> 08:13.090
You lied!
Why do you do that?

08:13.090 --> 08:15.527
It's not lying.
It's called dramatic license.

08:15.527 --> 08:17.137
So, Kellie!

08:17.137 --> 08:18.574
Where to next?

08:18.574 --> 08:20.837
I see some
fun stuff over there...

08:20.837 --> 08:22.447
Yay, let's go!

08:22.447 --> 08:24.449
If only I could speak
in front of people like that...

08:26.973 --> 08:29.715
Lemonade! Lemonade!

08:29.715 --> 08:32.152
Hey lady!
How about some Lemonade?

08:33.501 --> 08:34.503
Phanpy!

08:34.503 --> 08:35.504
Hold it!

08:38.855 --> 08:41.466
Now what's going on
here?! Keep it away from me!

08:41.466 --> 08:43.599
Sorry.
We didn't mean it!

08:54.958 --> 08:57.177
Didn't you know?!

08:57.177 --> 08:59.484
That lady's world-famous
for hating Pokémon!

08:59.484 --> 09:00.572
Are you serious?

09:00.572 --> 09:03.140
Don't let go!

09:03.140 --> 09:05.142
See her hand?
Who wears a glove in summer?

09:08.014 --> 09:09.102
Margo!

09:09.102 --> 09:10.103
I'm sorry!

09:10.103 --> 09:11.017
The mayor's daughter!

09:12.018 --> 09:13.367
Hey!

09:13.367 --> 09:15.152
Great, what'll we do now?

09:15.152 --> 09:16.588
Now we can't make
Lemonade because you

09:16.588 --> 09:17.720
knocked everything over!

09:17.720 --> 09:19.678
I'm... I'm sorry!

09:19.678 --> 09:21.593
You see,
I'm in a hurry...

09:21.593 --> 09:22.681
Don't give me that!

09:22.681 --> 09:24.683
You're
gonna pay for this!

09:28.557 --> 09:30.080
Just calm down...

09:31.516 --> 09:33.213
After all,
this is a festival,

09:33.213 --> 09:34.519
so let's have some fun!

09:35.955 --> 09:37.827
Hey! Who do
you think you are?!

09:37.827 --> 09:39.698
Get him, Phanpy!
Use Rollout!

09:41.221 --> 09:42.222
Dodge it!

09:47.837 --> 09:48.881
Oh, wow...

09:48.881 --> 09:49.969
Now use Iron Tail!

09:52.276 --> 09:53.712
Phanpy, use Tackle!

09:59.892 --> 10:01.415
So you wanna
go another round?

10:01.415 --> 10:03.896
I'm...I'm letting
you off easy today...

10:05.289 --> 10:06.682
We're going home!

10:06.682 --> 10:08.553
We're not
gonna forget this!

10:09.598 --> 10:10.686
Thank you!

10:10.686 --> 10:12.688
No prob. Are you okay?

10:12.688 --> 10:14.733
Sure. Thank
you, too, Pikachu!

10:16.387 --> 10:18.389
My name's Ash,
from Pallet Town.

10:18.389 --> 10:20.217
This is my partner,
Pikachu.

10:21.174 --> 10:22.611
I'm Margo.

10:22.611 --> 10:24.482
Did you two come
here for the Wind Festival?

10:24.482 --> 10:25.614
Yup. You bet!

10:27.790 --> 10:29.008
Impressive!

10:29.008 --> 10:31.271
Indeed! Such agility!

10:31.271 --> 10:34.448
So what plan to pinch
Pikachu is on today's menu?

10:34.448 --> 10:37.451
The right one. We'll
start our own juice business.

10:37.451 --> 10:39.062
A perfect idea,
of course...

10:39.062 --> 10:40.498
Let's get started.

10:40.498 --> 10:42.239
JAMES/Wait,
you're not serious!

10:42.239 --> 10:45.242
We can help those
thirsty folks. Success is the

10:45.242 --> 10:48.985
right product at the right time.
And we've managed both!

10:48.985 --> 10:50.726
We're cool cash magnets!

10:50.726 --> 10:53.685
What about Pikachu?
How does that relate?

10:53.685 --> 10:54.730
Do you get it?

10:57.123 --> 10:59.430
Wow! Cash
relates to everything!

11:02.912 --> 11:04.783
Then we'll
be able to see Lugia?

11:04.783 --> 11:07.351
Sure. On the
last day of the festival.

11:07.351 --> 11:09.309
After all,
it's the main event!

11:09.309 --> 11:11.224
Sounds awesome!

11:11.224 --> 11:12.573
Hey! Look at that!

11:13.618 --> 11:15.446
The eternal flame!

11:15.446 --> 11:19.102
Lugia first sees the
flame, then it sends the wind.

11:19.102 --> 11:21.887
Wow... And, what's that?

11:21.887 --> 11:23.715
An old power plant.

11:23.715 --> 11:25.369
That's what I've heard.

11:25.369 --> 11:27.937
It broke down years ago
during a fire on the mountain.

11:27.937 --> 11:30.156
They haven't used it since.

11:30.156 --> 11:32.811
I also heard that
during the fire, Lugia brought

11:32.811 --> 11:34.639
heavy rains and put it out!

11:34.639 --> 11:36.293
Lugia's just so cool!

11:37.686 --> 11:39.557
Well, I'm gonna
be heading this way.

11:39.557 --> 11:41.907
And the Wind
Festival is over that way.

11:41.907 --> 11:43.517
Got it. Thanks a lot.

11:43.517 --> 11:44.954
See you later!

11:44.954 --> 11:45.955
Later!

11:51.003 --> 11:52.178
Wow...

11:52.178 --> 11:53.397
All right!

11:53.397 --> 11:55.791
Oh yeah!
I am the best at this!

11:55.791 --> 11:56.922
Congratulations!

11:56.922 --> 11:58.097
See that folks,
everybody's a winner!

11:58.097 --> 11:58.968
Thank you!
Thank you so much!

11:58.968 --> 12:00.056
Here ya go, pal!

12:00.056 --> 12:01.448
Thanks, kid!

12:01.448 --> 12:02.841
This is for you.

12:02.841 --> 12:05.235
You did it!
Thanks, Uncle Callahan!

12:05.235 --> 12:07.106
I'd win
a dozen before lunch.

12:07.106 --> 12:08.673
Good for you, Kellie.

12:08.673 --> 12:10.631
This toy that Uncle
Callahan won for me will be

12:10.631 --> 12:12.329
my treasure forever and ever!

12:15.767 --> 12:17.073
You all right?

12:18.117 --> 12:19.292
I'm sorry.

12:19.292 --> 12:20.903
Me, too! Are you hurt?

12:20.903 --> 12:22.426
Thanks. I'm fine.

12:22.426 --> 12:24.210
I wasn't looking
where I was going.

12:28.388 --> 12:30.129
'Scuse me.
Where's your Pokémon?

12:30.129 --> 12:31.609
Oh.

12:31.609 --> 12:33.567
I came here to catch one.

12:33.567 --> 12:36.788
And it must be super-rare
because I haven't found a thing!

12:36.788 --> 12:38.834
All you have to do
is ask Uncle Callahan!

12:38.834 --> 12:40.139
Me?!

12:40.139 --> 12:41.880
He's the best
Pokémon Trainer ever!

12:41.880 --> 12:43.273
Really?

12:43.273 --> 12:45.144
Please tell me where
to catch one, please?

12:45.144 --> 12:46.798
All right.
What Pokémon?

12:48.931 --> 12:50.280
It's this one.

12:50.280 --> 12:51.803
Oh. That one.

12:51.803 --> 12:53.544
It's
super rare, all right.

12:53.544 --> 12:56.590
Yeah? It is?
Where can I find it?

12:56.590 --> 12:58.636
Hold on, hold on...

12:58.636 --> 13:01.552
I've got it!
Over there, over there!

13:01.552 --> 13:04.381
The latest info
says it's up on that mountain!

13:04.381 --> 13:06.949
That's wonderful!
That's so nice of you!

13:06.949 --> 13:08.777
No prob.

13:16.610 --> 13:18.047
Now you've done it, buddy!

13:21.180 --> 13:22.747
Coming up on Main Street

13:22.747 --> 13:24.488
the Wind Festival's exciting...

13:24.488 --> 13:26.403
...Pokémon catch race!

13:26.403 --> 13:28.971
All Pokémon Trainers
are encouraged to join

13:28.971 --> 13:29.972
in on the fun!

13:31.016 --> 13:32.278
Pikachu, did you hear that?

13:33.671 --> 13:37.370
Uncle Callahan!
It's a catch race! Do it!

13:37.370 --> 13:39.285
I'm sure
you'll be the winner!

13:39.285 --> 13:41.679
Of course!
No doubt I will!

13:41.679 --> 13:44.551
After all, I'm the
best Trainer that ever trained!

13:44.551 --> 13:46.640
I'll bring down
the strongest of the strong,

13:46.640 --> 13:49.121
and win the trophy to give
to Kellie as a present!

13:49.121 --> 13:52.298
Yeah?! All right!!

13:52.298 --> 13:53.560
Come on, now.

13:58.043 --> 14:00.002
The speaker isn't coming?

14:00.002 --> 14:01.220
Now what, Toren?

14:01.220 --> 14:02.439
I'll
think of something...

14:03.701 --> 14:05.007
What do you mean,
think of something?!

14:06.269 --> 14:08.401
You know
the presentation's tomorrow.

14:08.401 --> 14:11.665
Find someone? You could've
just asked us to...

14:11.665 --> 14:14.320
I'll be all right!

14:14.320 --> 14:16.757
I'll figure
something out, don't worry.

14:16.757 --> 14:19.238
We need this
to continue our research.

14:19.238 --> 14:21.414
You of all people
should know how important

14:21.414 --> 14:22.415
that is, Toren!

14:25.244 --> 14:26.289
We're counting on you.

14:31.903 --> 14:33.209
What's in there?

14:33.209 --> 14:34.863
Winning a catch race...

14:34.863 --> 14:36.952
This says it's
the Pokémon Research Pavilion.

14:36.952 --> 14:38.649
Pokémon
Research Pavilion?

14:43.175 --> 14:45.656
Anybody
work around here?

14:45.656 --> 14:49.051
Yes. That would be me.

14:49.051 --> 14:51.662
This awful heat
has finally gotten my brains

14:51.662 --> 14:53.707
to the point where
they're extra crispy.

14:53.707 --> 14:55.057
I don't
think you're crazy...

14:57.929 --> 15:00.540
I'm sorry!
Did it touch your clothes?!

15:00.540 --> 15:01.759
No...

15:01.759 --> 15:03.674
But don't
you go jumping out from

15:03.674 --> 15:04.805
behind things, understand?!

15:04.805 --> 15:06.068
Want to give me a heart attack?!

15:06.068 --> 15:07.460
No, of course not...

15:07.460 --> 15:09.767
Here. Sign these...

15:09.767 --> 15:11.943
...and give them
to festival administration.

15:11.943 --> 15:13.379
Yes. I will!

15:13.379 --> 15:14.946
Right.

15:14.946 --> 15:16.034
I'm very sorry.

15:19.690 --> 15:23.172
Brother! You're
a Pokémon Re... searcher...

15:23.172 --> 15:26.088
And that means you
know everything about Pokémon!

15:26.784 --> 15:28.090
A-ha!

16:03.299 --> 16:04.822
These are for you two.

16:05.823 --> 16:06.824
Dig in.

16:10.219 --> 16:14.049
I'm sorry! I know it's
my fault that you got hurt.

16:14.049 --> 16:15.964
The Oran Berries
will help you get better,

16:15.964 --> 16:17.182
so eat them all up, okay?

16:21.273 --> 16:22.448
Be back soon.

16:35.896 --> 16:38.421
Wow... So many people!

16:38.421 --> 16:40.640
Lots of luck,
Uncle Callahan!

16:42.468 --> 16:44.470
I wonder what kind of
Pokémon we'll be catching...

16:44.470 --> 16:46.124
It'll be fun, right pal?

16:47.604 --> 16:49.214
Get your Lum Berry juice!

16:49.214 --> 16:50.520
Perfect for a catch race!

16:50.520 --> 16:52.783
Give something
healthy to your Pokémon!

16:52.783 --> 16:55.481
Lum Berries are
the best thing for a Pokémon!

16:55.481 --> 16:58.441
It's a very special
berry that can cure sleepiness,

16:58.441 --> 17:00.921
numbness, confusion, or just
about anything that ails ya!

17:02.097 --> 17:03.707
Hello everyone!

17:03.707 --> 17:05.970
We're just about to begin the
Wind Festival's catch race!

17:05.970 --> 17:09.191
The rules are
simple! Pokémon with a special

17:09.191 --> 17:12.150
mark are waiting all over Fula
City for Trainers to come along!

17:14.848 --> 17:16.241
But some of
them are very strong Pokémon,

17:16.241 --> 17:18.329
too, and they won't
be caught so easily!

17:19.896 --> 17:21.246
Participating
Trainers must catch these

17:21.246 --> 17:23.509
Pokémon with special
catch race Poké Balls!

17:25.945 --> 17:26.685
Points
will be awarded according

17:26.685 --> 17:27.599
to a Pokémon's strength.

17:29.037 --> 17:30.429
The Trainer
with the most points at

17:30.429 --> 17:31.648
the end of the competition
...will be the winner!

17:32.953 --> 17:34.433
Testing.
One, two, three. Come in.

17:35.695 --> 17:37.175
Everything's fine.

17:37.175 --> 17:39.308
I can hear
you loud and clear.

17:39.308 --> 17:42.398
Mr. Callahan, if I
do this, then you'll do our

17:42.398 --> 17:44.008
presentation for us right?

17:44.008 --> 17:47.098
Of course I will.
It's a win-win for both of us.

17:47.098 --> 17:48.882
So I'm counting on you.

17:48.882 --> 17:51.972
Right. But I
sincerely want you to avoid

17:51.972 --> 17:53.626
overworking my Staryu, okay?

17:53.626 --> 17:54.932
You've got it!

17:54.932 --> 17:56.847
Trainers
to the starting line!

17:56.847 --> 17:58.283
Ready?!

17:58.283 --> 17:59.676
GO!

17:59.676 --> 18:00.894
Let's hit it, Pikachu!

18:06.030 --> 18:08.032
We'll catch a bunch
and win that trophy!

18:10.165 --> 18:11.166
An Ekans!

18:12.341 --> 18:14.038
Use Quick Attack!

18:18.695 --> 18:19.739
Go!

18:23.656 --> 18:24.831
Yes!

18:24.831 --> 18:26.442
We caught
our first Pokémon!

18:31.577 --> 18:32.535
It's strong!

18:43.198 --> 18:44.373
The Trainers are really

18:44.373 --> 18:45.765
scooping up those Pokémon!

18:47.158 --> 18:48.638
But the
trainer catching the most?

18:48.638 --> 18:50.205
A guy named Callahan!

18:50.205 --> 18:51.510
Go,
Uncle Callahan, go, go!

18:52.816 --> 18:54.644
Staryu's
Ability is Illuminate!

18:54.644 --> 18:56.254
Other Pokémon love it!

18:56.254 --> 18:57.734
And they're
making awfully good use of it...

19:13.097 --> 19:14.229
Pikachu, see that?

19:16.535 --> 19:17.841
Right. Let's go after it!

19:20.060 --> 19:21.758
Aww...I'm beat!

19:21.758 --> 19:23.934
You're doing great!
You're in first place!

19:33.291 --> 19:34.988
Now what's going on?

19:53.398 --> 19:57.533
Sudowoodo is weak
against water! You can catch it!

19:57.533 --> 19:59.926
Oh, no!
We're just receiving word of...

19:59.926 --> 20:01.885
...a Tyranitar
rampaging though the city,

20:01.885 --> 20:04.540
and a Trainer named Ash
seems to be chasing it!

20:04.540 --> 20:06.846
Uh, there
appears to be some sort of cord

20:06.846 --> 20:08.544
wrapped around Tyranitar's neck!

20:08.544 --> 20:09.545
No way!

20:13.026 --> 20:14.289
Tyranitar!

20:17.901 --> 20:21.165
Pikachu, do you think you
can lead Tyranitar over there?

20:22.601 --> 20:24.299
I'm counting on you, buddy!

20:53.241 --> 20:56.244
You know, you
shouldn't lie to yourself.

20:56.244 --> 20:57.854
It's habit forming.

20:57.854 --> 21:00.683
That's the Imitation
Pokémon. That's what it does!

21:00.683 --> 21:01.814
Shut up!

21:03.163 --> 21:04.382
Hurry and
find me the next Pokémon.

21:33.411 --> 21:35.761
I've got you now,
Tyranitar!

21:35.761 --> 21:37.328
Oh, no!

21:37.328 --> 21:39.678
There are dozens of people
right where Tyranitar's headed!

21:42.855 --> 21:44.248
Right, Pikachu! Go for it!

21:44.248 --> 21:45.902
Use Iron Tail!

21:53.518 --> 21:55.433
Tyranitar!

21:57.043 --> 21:59.959
Hey... Everything's gonna
be all right now! I promise.

21:59.959 --> 22:01.352
You were great, Pikachu!

22:02.919 --> 22:05.748
Fantastic!
Ash managed to save Tyranitar!

22:05.748 --> 22:07.750
They created a
bond that's even stronger than

22:07.750 --> 22:09.621
simply catching! What passion!

22:09.621 --> 22:10.970
Can you stand?

22:15.453 --> 22:17.194
We present
the Mayor's Prize to the

22:17.194 --> 22:20.153
second-place finisher in the
catch race, Ash Ketchum, for his

22:20.153 --> 22:22.460
brilliant rescue of Tyranitar!

22:22.460 --> 22:24.244
Thank you very much!

22:24.244 --> 22:28.031
Not so fast, son. Thank
you for rescuing Tyranitar.

22:28.031 --> 22:30.120
All 'cause of Pikachu!

22:30.120 --> 22:32.078
That's why it worked.

22:32.078 --> 22:33.515
All 'cause of Pikachu!

22:35.386 --> 22:39.347
And now! The
grand prize... goes to Callahan!

22:39.347 --> 22:41.087
See, Kellie?

22:41.087 --> 22:43.394
Uncle Callahan,
you're the best!

22:46.441 --> 22:49.052
Congratulations
on your first-place finish

22:49.052 --> 22:50.706
Thanks!

22:50.706 --> 22:53.273
But you come to expect
these sorts of things with me.

22:53.273 --> 22:55.275
By the way,
are there any Pokémon that

22:55.275 --> 22:56.668
you'd like to catch next?

22:56.668 --> 22:58.191
Next? Let's see...

23:01.151 --> 23:03.588
I've been hearing
there's an extremely rare

23:03.588 --> 23:04.981
Pokémon around this area...

23:04.981 --> 23:07.070
Well
I hadn't heard about that.

23:07.070 --> 23:09.159
An extremely
rare Pokémon?

23:09.159 --> 23:11.770
Since I'm already
at the Wind Festival, I was

23:11.770 --> 23:13.119
hoping I could catch it.

23:13.119 --> 23:14.164
Heard of this before?

23:14.164 --> 23:15.208
No...

23:15.208 --> 23:16.253
Seriously?

23:16.253 --> 23:17.297
I wanna catch it!

23:17.297 --> 23:18.386
Wonder what Pokémon it is!

23:19.952 --> 23:20.953
We'd like
to thank Callahan, our winner,

23:20.953 --> 23:22.128
for his time!

23:22.128 --> 23:24.217
Thank you!

23:24.217 --> 23:26.219
The Pokémon Channel!

23:26.219 --> 23:27.830
I've got a late-breaking,

23:27.830 --> 23:29.484
important newsflash!

23:29.484 --> 23:31.355
There's an extremely

23:31.355 --> 23:33.009
rare Pokémon in Fula City!

23:33.009 --> 23:34.184
If you're
a Pokémon Trainer, you can't

23:34.184 --> 23:36.491
let this chance pass you by!

23:52.420 --> 23:53.682
Maybe
I'm imagining things...

23:59.122 --> 24:01.516
I wanna play
more with Uncle Callahan...

24:01.516 --> 24:03.474
Little miss
is talking in her sleep.

24:03.474 --> 24:06.869
She did run all over
the place. She's exhausted.

24:06.869 --> 24:07.783
That's fine with me.

24:09.393 --> 24:12.483
Wait.
What are you doing following us?

24:14.920 --> 24:16.879
Now
don't give me that!

24:16.879 --> 24:18.924
I returned
all the Pokémon I caught!

24:18.924 --> 24:21.057
And excuse me,
but I never caught you!

24:22.362 --> 24:24.582
You're following
my big brother because

24:24.582 --> 24:26.497
you like him, right?

24:27.846 --> 24:28.978
Go home!

24:30.632 --> 24:31.894
Why don't you go and
find somebody else to bother?

24:36.551 --> 24:38.161
Didn't
you hear a word I said?

24:39.162 --> 24:40.337
Oh hey!

24:42.034 --> 24:43.558
Did you
like the Wind Festival?

24:43.558 --> 24:45.211
It was lots of fun!

24:45.211 --> 24:48.127
I rode the roller coaster
and went in the haunted house...

24:48.127 --> 24:49.389
What about you?

24:49.389 --> 24:51.957
I was very busy today.

24:51.957 --> 24:54.743
The man who won the
catch race said something

24:54.743 --> 24:57.702
about a rare Pokémon
being in the area, but...

24:57.702 --> 25:02.794
Some story! I haven't
heard one word about that.

25:02.794 --> 25:05.928
But...weren't there
stories about Zeraora?

25:05.928 --> 25:08.104
Now, Margo.
It doesn't exist anymore.

25:09.540 --> 25:11.890
Father?

25:11.890 --> 25:14.414
We can't have
our citizens panicking!

25:14.414 --> 25:16.547
I want no
more talk of this!

25:16.547 --> 25:17.548
Yes, Father...

25:23.685 --> 25:25.948
Oh, come on! Where's
this thing supposed to be?!

25:30.692 --> 25:31.910
Would you
stop scaring me?!

25:36.088 --> 25:40.223
Hey, you! Don't you
know this mountain's off limits!

25:40.223 --> 25:42.878
You've heard of
Zeraora's curse, haven't you?

25:42.878 --> 25:46.316
Now wait just a second!
Zeraora? Curse?

25:46.316 --> 25:48.187
You're not
from around here are ya...

25:48.187 --> 25:50.973
Anyway, it's forbidden
to be here, so let's go.

25:50.973 --> 25:55.020
Fine, I'll come! Just
tell me, okay? This Pokémon...

25:55.020 --> 25:58.023
I hear it's rare.
You know it?

25:58.023 --> 26:01.157
Rare? Really?
Looks like just an Eevee to me.

26:01.157 --> 26:02.898
They don't
live around these parts.

26:02.898 --> 26:06.728
That old man lied
to me through his teeth!

26:10.166 --> 26:12.255
You scamps! How did you
get in here in the first place?!

26:17.390 --> 26:20.045
This one is
off limits! You got that?

26:22.004 --> 26:23.571
Stay away from me!!

26:34.756 --> 26:36.801
You worked hard,
didn't you, Staryu?

26:38.020 --> 26:39.891
But thanks
to your work, it seems

26:39.891 --> 26:40.805
we'll get through tomorrow.

26:47.116 --> 26:50.249
That man is extremely
good at performance, isn't he?

26:50.249 --> 26:53.383
So the presentation
should go well.

26:53.383 --> 26:56.604
So, Meowth, what kind
of research is he doing?

26:56.604 --> 26:58.301
Let's see...

26:58.301 --> 27:01.565
It looks like research
on Pokémon Abilities and moves.

27:01.565 --> 27:04.524
Perfect! I mean,
I have no idea what it means,

27:04.524 --> 27:05.961
but it's got to help!

27:12.794 --> 27:14.665
All right.
Let's do some stealing!

27:14.665 --> 27:15.710
Yeah...

27:19.191 --> 27:21.063
Is, uh, somebody there?

27:27.504 --> 27:29.462
Hey, everyone!
Wait, please!

27:33.379 --> 27:35.860
So. This is all it was.

27:35.860 --> 27:37.122
Everyone,
careful of the glass.

27:39.472 --> 27:41.344
This is the essence
we made from Smeargle ink.

27:43.041 --> 27:44.477
I wonder
why it fell down.

27:49.395 --> 27:50.527
That was close!

27:50.527 --> 27:51.659
I panicked.

27:51.659 --> 27:53.922
There's
always another day.

27:58.970 --> 28:01.756
Imagine, there might be
Pokémon we've never heard of

28:01.756 --> 28:04.323
before living somewhere
around this place, you know?

28:18.468 --> 28:21.036
Oh, yes...

28:21.036 --> 28:23.299
Those scamps
forced me to sleep outside...

28:35.311 --> 28:36.355
So what do
you wanna do today?

28:36.355 --> 28:37.443
Buddy?

28:49.325 --> 28:50.456
I found you!

28:50.456 --> 28:52.154
You found me?
Whaddaya mean?

29:00.510 --> 29:02.033
Pikachu's sorry about that.

29:02.033 --> 29:04.122
No problem.
Ancient history!

29:04.122 --> 29:06.298
I'm just so glad
the second-place winner in

29:06.298 --> 29:07.735
the catch race can help me!

29:07.735 --> 29:09.345
Hope I don't let you down.

29:10.650 --> 29:12.043
You see, my last
"big helper just fed me

29:12.043 --> 29:12.957
nothing but lies!

29:18.397 --> 29:20.051
You're the best, Pikachu!

29:27.232 --> 29:28.277
That's the one!

29:29.582 --> 29:30.583
Before you can catch it,
you battle it.

29:30.583 --> 29:32.107
What Pokémon do you have?

29:32.107 --> 29:33.412
I don't have any.

29:33.412 --> 29:34.587
You don't, huh?

29:34.587 --> 29:36.546
'Kay!o you mind, Pikachu?

29:37.808 --> 29:39.418
So now...

29:39.418 --> 29:40.506
...you go take it on!

29:41.594 --> 29:43.988
You're kidding!

29:47.252 --> 29:48.210
I can't!

29:51.909 --> 29:53.998
Sorry, Pikachu!

29:55.434 --> 29:59.003
Just keep calm!
Now listen! Watch Eevee closely!

29:59.003 --> 30:00.831
All right!

30:02.920 --> 30:04.008
Pikachu, dodge it!

30:05.096 --> 30:06.663
Risa! Call a Quick Attack!

30:06.663 --> 30:07.751
Use Quick Attack!

30:14.366 --> 30:16.194
Do it!
Throw the Poké Ball now!

30:16.194 --> 30:17.456
Right. Got it!

30:19.241 --> 30:20.764
Go!

30:29.338 --> 30:30.687
Tough break! Try again!

30:30.687 --> 30:31.775
Right!

30:35.953 --> 30:37.215
Now Iron Tail!

30:37.215 --> 30:38.303
Iron Tail, go!

30:42.220 --> 30:43.656
Now Thunderbolt!

30:43.656 --> 30:44.701
Use Thunderbolt!

30:52.578 --> 30:54.406
Risa!

30:54.406 --> 30:56.191
Here we go!

31:08.812 --> 31:10.683
Good for you, Risa!

31:10.683 --> 31:12.903
Does that
mean I caught it?

31:12.903 --> 31:14.209
Yup!

31:15.906 --> 31:19.736
All right! All right!
I just caught myself an Eevee!

31:21.259 --> 31:23.348
Thank you, Ash, Pikachu!

31:24.523 --> 31:25.873
Where are your eyebrows?!

31:33.010 --> 31:34.403
Thanks for waiting.

31:36.361 --> 31:37.885
Hey, let's see Eevee!

31:48.939 --> 31:51.115
I'm Risa.
Can we be friends?

31:54.031 --> 31:55.685
You'll see!
You'll be friends in no time!

32:03.998 --> 32:07.001
This was the first time
I ever caught a Pokémon.

32:07.001 --> 32:10.874
This feeling. I haven't
felt passion in so long!

32:10.874 --> 32:12.658
Right? Fun, isn't it?

32:12.658 --> 32:14.965
I've been training
in track and field since

32:14.965 --> 32:18.273
I was little. I had no idea
I could catch a Pokémon!

32:18.273 --> 32:21.493
Awesome!
Then you're quick on your feet?

32:21.493 --> 32:24.540
This might surprise you,
but I was the regional champion.

32:24.540 --> 32:26.455
That's awesome!

32:26.455 --> 32:27.543
But then...

32:27.543 --> 32:28.631
I gave it up.

32:28.631 --> 32:30.502
Why's that?

32:30.502 --> 32:33.679
I got injured. It's healed
up good as new now, though.

32:34.593 --> 32:36.378
Whoa...

32:36.378 --> 32:38.162
I suddenly
got scared to run.

32:44.777 --> 32:46.562
I think now that
Eevee's here, you'll

32:46.562 --> 32:47.911
be able to run again.

32:47.911 --> 32:49.739
How come?

32:49.739 --> 32:51.262
I mean...

32:51.262 --> 32:54.222
What you can't do on
your own, you can do with a

32:54.222 --> 32:56.398
Pokémon pal there by your side!

32:58.530 --> 33:00.880
Really?

33:06.538 --> 33:08.279
Officer Jenny?
What's wrong?

33:10.890 --> 33:13.850
Hey, Professor!

33:13.850 --> 33:17.462
What? What do you want?
It's early in the morning.

33:17.462 --> 33:20.161
I want to know
how you explain them!

33:21.727 --> 33:24.121
By them,
do you mean these Pokémon?

33:24.121 --> 33:26.384
They've been
acting strange ever since

33:26.384 --> 33:27.907
I came here yesterday!

33:27.907 --> 33:30.432
Ah, yesterday's
chemical spill...

33:30.432 --> 33:33.087
Of course that spill was
the essence of a Pokémon move

33:33.087 --> 33:35.306
that we call Sweet Scent.

33:35.306 --> 33:39.049
Pokémon love the smell,
so they gather around...

33:39.049 --> 33:41.486
What kind of
useless chemical is that?!

33:41.486 --> 33:44.185
I don't want any
Pokémon anywhere near me!

33:44.185 --> 33:46.665
I want that
stuff neutralized, now!

33:46.665 --> 33:48.928
Wait. I'm afraid...
I have nothing prepared...

33:50.104 --> 33:51.105
Toren!

33:52.149 --> 33:53.411
There's trouble!

33:53.411 --> 33:55.109
We just got word from
the festival admin!

33:58.808 --> 34:01.680
There are
signs of tampering with the

34:01.680 --> 34:04.379
attractions' electrical systems,
detergent spilled around town...

34:04.379 --> 34:07.121
...and reports
of other minor vandalism.

34:07.121 --> 34:09.601
I can't believe someone
would do something like this?

34:17.043 --> 34:18.915
Hey! YOU!

34:18.915 --> 34:21.525
Because of you,
I spent all night...

34:21.525 --> 34:22.918
Look, I'm sorry!

34:22.918 --> 34:25.313
I improvised. See?
My niece is right over there,

34:25.313 --> 34:27.228
so give me a break, okay?

34:27.228 --> 34:28.185
Pretty please?

34:29.491 --> 34:31.449
I'm begging here!

34:31.449 --> 34:34.539
People like you
end up in deep trouble.

34:34.539 --> 34:37.237
I know you! You
caught the Pokémon you wanted!

34:37.237 --> 34:39.456
Right, thanks
to your cool uncle here!

34:42.634 --> 34:44.201
Everyone my apologies!

34:44.201 --> 34:46.203
We'll make an
announcement when we're able

34:46.203 --> 34:47.813
to reopen the festival.

34:47.813 --> 34:49.641
We ask for
your continued patience.

34:49.641 --> 34:51.208
I guess it can't be helped.

34:51.208 --> 34:52.905
Let's head
back to the hotel and wait.

34:53.949 --> 34:55.038
Mr. Mayor?

34:55.038 --> 34:56.213
We can help out, too!

34:56.213 --> 34:57.301
Hey, it's Ash!

34:57.301 --> 34:58.737
Margo!

34:58.737 --> 35:01.653
Fascinating! You two
already know each other?

35:01.653 --> 35:03.264
We met in town yesterday.

35:03.264 --> 35:05.527
When you said,
We'll help out, you weren't

35:05.527 --> 35:07.137
signing me up, right?

35:07.137 --> 35:09.879
Sure, the sooner the city
goes back to normal and the

35:09.879 --> 35:11.402
festival starts, the better!

35:11.402 --> 35:14.144
Come on! Can we
PLEASE help out, too?

35:15.754 --> 35:17.800
It would be great to
receive aid from both the catch

35:17.800 --> 35:19.367
race winner and the runner-up!

35:19.367 --> 35:20.629
Yikes.

35:20.629 --> 35:21.934
Uh...

35:21.934 --> 35:23.675
I actually can't stay.

35:23.675 --> 35:25.938
I have a speaking
engagement at an important

35:25.938 --> 35:27.592
research conference.

35:28.898 --> 35:31.074
Why would you go to
a research conference?

35:31.074 --> 35:33.032
Uh...
See, it's like this...

35:33.032 --> 35:37.124
Liar. I feel so sorry
for your little niece.

35:37.124 --> 35:40.910
I'll stay quiet...but
you'd just better help out!

35:42.651 --> 35:45.219
All right. You win!

35:45.219 --> 35:47.221
Awesome. Let's do it!

35:58.667 --> 36:00.973
Now they've
added another one.

36:00.973 --> 36:02.279
There, there you go.

36:04.325 --> 36:05.848
Professor?

36:05.848 --> 36:07.371
Don't you have a
research presentation today?

36:07.371 --> 36:08.242
Yes.

36:13.377 --> 36:14.987
The Pokémon Channel!

36:14.987 --> 36:16.641
Time
again for the Pokémon Channel!

36:16.641 --> 36:18.382
Day two of the Wind Festival

36:18.382 --> 36:19.383
was marked by chaos!

36:19.383 --> 36:20.993
Ding!

36:20.993 --> 36:22.995
Somebody
played a bunch of pranks,

36:22.995 --> 36:24.649
threatening the
festival's opening...

36:24.649 --> 36:26.434
...but the vendors and

36:26.434 --> 36:29.350
townspeople are working very
hard to reopen the festival!

36:29.350 --> 36:30.960
So don't you worry!

36:35.617 --> 36:38.141
Man, why do we have
to be on cleanup detail?

36:38.141 --> 36:40.143
It's gotta
be Zeraora's curse!

36:42.624 --> 36:45.104
It's you guys!

36:45.104 --> 36:48.020
Hey you! Tell us
what Zeraora's curse is!

36:48.020 --> 36:49.761
You don't know?

36:49.761 --> 36:52.721
When Zeraora vanished
during the fire fifty years ago,

36:52.721 --> 36:54.549
the whole mountain was cursed!

36:54.549 --> 36:57.029
If a human sets
one foot onto the mountain,

36:57.029 --> 36:58.596
it'll bring disaster!

36:58.596 --> 37:00.946
And that's
Zeraora's curse!

37:00.946 --> 37:02.252
It's a lie!

37:02.252 --> 37:03.993
It's just not true!

37:03.993 --> 37:05.908
Hey, Margo...
What's wrong?

37:08.780 --> 37:11.653
This is a message
from festival administration.

37:11.653 --> 37:15.091
Since we've met safety
standards in all locations...

37:15.091 --> 37:17.833
We hereby reopen
the Wind Festival!

37:18.877 --> 37:20.401
Thank goodness, buddy!

37:20.401 --> 37:21.228
It went a lot faster
with everybody pitching in.

37:22.359 --> 37:23.708
Goody, goody!

37:23.708 --> 37:25.797
We've got
an emergency situation...

37:25.797 --> 37:27.712
Let's clean up what's
left in one shot, okay!

37:29.192 --> 37:30.454
Thank goodness!

37:30.454 --> 37:31.977
Let's get the
presentation ready!

37:31.977 --> 37:33.196
All right!

37:33.196 --> 37:34.415
Professor?

37:34.415 --> 37:35.764
Another one's
joined the group!

37:37.156 --> 37:38.375
Can't you be a
little quicker about this?

37:41.160 --> 37:42.814
I'm about to be buried
in an avalanche of Pokémon!

37:42.814 --> 37:45.817
Forgive me. I'll find a
solution before that happens.

37:45.817 --> 37:47.863
Right after
my presentation!

37:47.863 --> 37:49.256
I'm counting on it!

37:58.569 --> 38:01.311
Wow! The cable
car's working again, too!

38:01.311 --> 38:03.139
Our work here is done.

38:03.139 --> 38:06.534
Oh, no!

38:09.885 --> 38:12.191
Where did my uncle go?

38:16.848 --> 38:19.895
He's acting strange!
I'll bet he did this!

38:19.895 --> 38:21.200
He did not!

38:21.200 --> 38:22.201
Let's follow him anyway!

38:22.201 --> 38:23.246
Right!

38:26.902 --> 38:27.990
Where is he?

38:27.990 --> 38:29.165
'Scuse . Toren...

38:29.165 --> 38:30.253
It's time.

38:30.253 --> 38:32.037
Yeah.

38:32.037 --> 38:34.083
Here's the image
data for the presentation.

38:34.083 --> 38:35.214
Thanks.

38:35.214 --> 38:37.042
Are you going
to be all right?

38:37.042 --> 38:39.741
I'll manage somehow...

38:40.872 --> 38:42.396
Says it all.

39:11.468 --> 39:13.775
So...

39:17.996 --> 39:19.520
Um...

39:19.520 --> 39:20.869
Let's see...

39:20.869 --> 39:22.958
Just do your best!
You can do this.

39:22.958 --> 39:25.526
I...want to thank you...
Thank you...for coming...

39:29.312 --> 39:31.706
Pull yourself together!
You're a scientist!

39:31.706 --> 39:34.491
Today we w-wish to present...

39:34.491 --> 39:37.494
our Pokémon r-research...

39:37.494 --> 39:38.626
What's wrong with him?

39:38.626 --> 39:39.627
Stage fright?

39:41.280 --> 39:43.021
This...research...is...
the product...of a lot of hard

39:43.021 --> 39:44.196
work and...uh...late...nights...

39:44.196 --> 39:45.459
Uh-oh! I'm too late...

39:45.459 --> 39:47.461
Callahan?

39:47.461 --> 39:50.159
What business do
you have coming here?

39:50.159 --> 39:51.247
Um, well...

39:51.247 --> 39:52.291
Of...

39:52.291 --> 39:54.468
Toren! The visuals, now!

39:54.468 --> 39:55.469
Right!

39:55.469 --> 39:56.861
This is just great!

39:56.861 --> 39:59.342
There aren't more of you,
are there?

40:07.872 --> 40:10.484
Catch this one and
you'll be in first place!

40:10.484 --> 40:11.659
Cyndaquil is weak
against water, so use Water Gun!

40:11.659 --> 40:12.703
Got it!

40:12.703 --> 40:13.791
Use Water Gun!

40:19.101 --> 40:20.711
Yes!

40:20.711 --> 40:23.584
Now I won't
let Kellie down!

40:23.584 --> 40:26.151
My niece will think
I really am a great Trainer!

40:27.239 --> 40:28.327
Callahan?

40:28.327 --> 40:30.199
What was that all about?

40:30.199 --> 40:32.897
Uh...eh...uh...

40:35.378 --> 40:36.771
Uncle...

40:36.771 --> 40:38.076
Is that...

40:38.076 --> 40:40.818
No. Um. that's, uh...

40:40.818 --> 40:42.690
Did you... tell a lie?

40:50.219 --> 40:53.222
I got you! Who are you?

40:53.222 --> 40:55.485
Prepare for trouble!
We're the best.

40:55.485 --> 40:57.748
And make it double,
while forgetting the rest.

40:57.748 --> 40:59.968
Just shut your yaps,
we're hard-pressed!

41:01.796 --> 41:03.188
But still the best!

41:03.188 --> 41:04.842
Back to the nest...

41:06.627 --> 41:08.367
Uncle Callahan, I...

41:08.367 --> 41:10.108
...HATE YOU!!

41:10.108 --> 41:11.458
Kellie, wait!

41:13.851 --> 41:15.287
Kellie!

41:15.287 --> 41:16.245
Are you all right?

41:18.290 --> 41:19.553
JESSIE/JAMES/We're off!

41:19.553 --> 41:20.771
Robbers!

41:20.771 --> 41:22.033
The robbers
are getting away!

41:24.122 --> 41:25.602
Team Rocket?!

41:25.602 --> 41:26.690
Let's go, Pikachu!

41:37.527 --> 41:39.486
Eevee? Eevee?

41:44.621 --> 41:46.275
Eevee!

41:46.275 --> 41:47.798
Oh, no! What'll I do?!

41:47.798 --> 41:50.671
Eevee! Hang in there!
Eevee!

41:50.671 --> 41:52.499
Let me see!

41:52.499 --> 41:53.717
Is it...

41:53.717 --> 41:55.327
It's fine.
No need to worry.

41:55.327 --> 41:57.068
Chansey, use Heal Pulse!

42:00.289 --> 42:01.986
You'll be fine, Eevee!

42:04.162 --> 42:05.903
Stop right there,
Team Rocket!

42:05.903 --> 42:07.078
It's the Twerp!

42:07.078 --> 42:08.384
He's everywhere!

42:10.473 --> 42:11.518
Pikachu, use Thunderbolt!

42:13.607 --> 42:14.825
Wobbuffet, take it!

42:30.406 --> 42:31.494
Eevee!

42:32.539 --> 42:34.628
Eevee's
all right now.

42:34.628 --> 42:36.586
Speedy
first aid helped a lot.

42:36.586 --> 42:39.850
Eevee's leg still
hurts a bit, but just be sure

42:39.850 --> 42:44.115
not to aggravate it and
allow it plenty of rest.

42:44.115 --> 42:45.290
Thank you very much.

42:53.429 --> 42:55.823
How's Kellie?

42:55.823 --> 42:58.565
The doctor just
finished examining her.

42:58.565 --> 43:02.090
She's never had
the best energy or stamina.

43:02.090 --> 43:03.657
I guess the
last couple of days

43:03.657 --> 43:04.745
have taken their toll.

43:04.745 --> 43:07.138
I'm so sorry.
I'm responsible.

43:07.138 --> 43:10.185
No. It was my fault
for lying to her all the time.

43:16.234 --> 43:18.454
How'd it go?

43:18.454 --> 43:20.717
No luck.
I'm afraid we lost them.

43:21.892 --> 43:23.546
Wait is Eevee hurt?!

43:23.546 --> 43:26.723
Yeah. It got caught in the
panicked crowd after you left...

43:26.723 --> 43:29.247
But now, Nurse Joy's
treatment helped out a lot.

43:29.247 --> 43:30.640
It'll be fine.

43:30.640 --> 43:32.033
I'm glad.

43:32.033 --> 43:34.035
That Team Rocket...

43:34.035 --> 43:36.994
I'm afraid what Team
Rocket stole was Effect Spore.

43:36.994 --> 43:38.430
What about Officer Jenny?

43:38.430 --> 43:39.823
I filed a report.

43:39.823 --> 43:41.956
She told me that she
was going to investigate.

43:44.741 --> 43:47.309
I'm sure we're tired.
What a day.

43:47.309 --> 43:48.266
Let's get some rest.

44:02.890 --> 44:04.239
How's Kellie?

44:04.239 --> 44:05.936
She's sleeping.

44:05.936 --> 44:09.374
I'm thinking of taking
her back home with me tomorrow.

44:09.374 --> 44:10.462
I see.

44:11.463 --> 44:12.508
Where are you going?

44:13.596 --> 44:14.902
I don't know.

44:14.902 --> 44:18.383
But Kellie doesn't want
to see my face anymore.

44:18.383 --> 44:20.864
Not after
I let her down.

44:26.609 --> 44:27.654
You big idiot.

44:36.619 --> 44:38.839
Don't follow me.
Go away!

44:40.231 --> 44:43.713
It isn't
like you're my partner...

44:43.713 --> 44:46.629
You're throwing words
I said to you back in my face,

44:46.629 --> 44:48.283
and I deserve it!

44:48.283 --> 44:51.025
I'm giving
up lying forever.

44:51.025 --> 44:53.375
There's no
point in following me.

44:53.375 --> 44:55.116
Go someplace else.
Anywhere.

45:03.472 --> 45:07.302
I told all of you over
and over not to follow me!

45:07.302 --> 45:08.607
I'm not
putting up with it!

45:09.347 --> 45:11.480
Enough.

45:11.480 --> 45:13.090
It's
better being alone!

45:19.357 --> 45:20.881
If I had tried to run...

45:23.187 --> 45:24.798
...I could've
protected you...

45:26.669 --> 45:27.714
Understood.

45:27.714 --> 45:28.758
Well done.

45:29.716 --> 45:31.195
Hey, Father?

45:31.195 --> 45:32.327
Margo!

45:32.327 --> 45:34.111
What about
the Wind Festival?

45:34.111 --> 45:36.810
The committee just
decided to reopen tomorrow.

45:36.810 --> 45:38.028
We'll tighten security,

45:38.028 --> 45:40.422
and any safety concerns
will be addressed.

45:40.422 --> 45:42.380
That's great. I'm glad!

45:42.380 --> 45:44.643
No need to worry at all.

45:44.643 --> 45:46.907
We'll call
on Lugia tomorrow.

45:46.907 --> 45:48.604
Night, Father!

45:48.604 --> 45:49.648
Night!

46:42.310 --> 46:44.355
JESSIE/JAMES/To us!

46:46.357 --> 46:47.924
Okay, let's see it!

46:48.969 --> 46:51.580
But I thought you had it!

46:51.580 --> 46:53.582
But I gave it to Meowth.

46:53.582 --> 46:55.497
My paws never
even touched it!

46:55.497 --> 46:57.107
I gave it to you!

46:57.107 --> 46:59.588
I called you and did
a behind-the-back flip thing.

46:59.588 --> 47:02.591
Genius, I was running
in front of you the whole time!

47:02.591 --> 47:03.635
Egads!

47:03.635 --> 47:04.811
That means...

47:05.855 --> 47:08.205
Then who
did I fling it to?

47:08.205 --> 47:09.859
HORRORS!!

47:09.859 --> 47:12.470
Did I fling
it to a Ghost type?!

47:32.839 --> 47:35.232
Now what's
going on here?

47:35.232 --> 47:36.668
Never
seen that before...

47:49.159 --> 47:50.639
Risa?

47:50.639 --> 47:52.597
Hi. It sounds like
there's trouble outside, Ash.

47:56.384 --> 47:58.168
Ash, up there!

47:59.039 --> 48:00.562
The windmill...

48:00.562 --> 48:02.564
They say the winds have died

48:02.564 --> 48:04.479
down because the eternal
flame is gone!

48:04.479 --> 48:06.524
Gone?
As in completely?

48:06.524 --> 48:08.091
Yeah.

48:08.091 --> 48:09.919
This isn't just
about the festival, is it?

48:13.270 --> 48:14.619
The eternal flame?

48:15.707 --> 48:16.708
Come on!

48:18.710 --> 48:21.322
Honestly!
Why do we have to do this?

48:21.322 --> 48:23.193
Whose fault
does he think it is that

48:23.193 --> 48:24.455
the presentation was a bust?

48:24.455 --> 48:25.761
He'll hear you.

48:25.761 --> 48:27.763
I knew we
should've never released

48:27.763 --> 48:30.418
our results with his!
It would've been better.

48:30.418 --> 48:33.203
Next time, say
something before we all meet up!

48:33.203 --> 48:34.944
Enough of
that kind of talk!

48:36.685 --> 48:39.340
There's no one who's
more concerned about the

48:39.340 --> 48:41.559
welfare of Pokémon than Toren.

48:41.559 --> 48:44.301
Which one of you loves
Pokémon more than Toren?

48:44.301 --> 48:46.390
Does anyone know
more about them than he does?

48:46.390 --> 48:48.479
Anyone?!

48:48.479 --> 48:51.700
I think the one thing
needed in Pokémon research...

48:51.700 --> 48:53.180
...is what he gives.

48:53.180 --> 48:55.138
More than any
of the rest of us.

48:59.360 --> 49:01.231
They say the wind died.

49:01.231 --> 49:02.537
Hey what's going on?

49:07.803 --> 49:09.848
Kellie,
are you feeling all right?

49:11.546 --> 49:12.851
Where's my uncle?

49:12.851 --> 49:15.158
He said he was going home.

49:16.464 --> 49:18.422
I think...

49:18.422 --> 49:19.946
...I said
something bad to him.

49:20.816 --> 49:22.078
Kellie...

49:22.078 --> 49:23.558
It's all right.

49:23.558 --> 49:26.517
Now cheer up! Your uncle
doesn't mind at all!

49:32.045 --> 49:32.959
Mr. Mayor!

49:33.872 --> 49:35.004
It's Ash.

49:35.004 --> 49:36.397
I heard the
eternal flame is out!

49:36.397 --> 49:37.398
Yes.

49:37.398 --> 49:38.790
And that's why the wind...

49:38.790 --> 49:41.750
Lugia sends it
toward the eternal flame.

49:41.750 --> 49:43.186
But now...

49:43.186 --> 49:45.449
Does that mean
that Lugia doesn't know where

49:45.449 --> 49:46.885
to send the wind anymore?

49:46.885 --> 49:48.496
Yes.

49:48.496 --> 49:51.064
We need the eternal
flame. By the end of the night.

49:51.064 --> 49:52.804
No later than dawn tomorrow.

49:52.804 --> 49:54.589
Without the wind,
the city will eventually

49:54.589 --> 49:56.156
run out of power.

49:56.156 --> 49:57.418
No way...

49:57.418 --> 49:59.028
Do you mind if
I take a closer look?

49:59.028 --> 50:00.116
Go.

50:03.032 --> 50:07.210
I'm really afraid
of high places!

50:14.478 --> 50:15.566
What's up, buddy?

50:16.611 --> 50:17.786
You figured something out!

50:17.786 --> 50:19.744
Us, too?!

50:22.965 --> 50:24.314
Good! It's nice and lively!

50:24.314 --> 50:25.446
We can sell every one

50:25.446 --> 50:27.013
of these for a good price!

50:27.013 --> 50:30.146
Pokémon
hunting is a good thing...

50:30.146 --> 50:32.366
Love the great outdoors!

50:38.067 --> 50:40.939
It's Pikachu.

50:40.939 --> 50:42.289
Pikachu!

50:42.289 --> 50:44.291
The crook that
stole the eternal flame...

50:44.291 --> 50:45.901
Is that Smeargle?

50:46.989 --> 50:48.382
Eternal flame?

50:48.382 --> 50:49.774
Yeah, it's been stolen.

50:49.774 --> 50:51.689
Pikachu has been
following the scent and

50:51.689 --> 50:52.864
it led straight here.

50:52.864 --> 50:54.649
Right here to Smeargle.

50:54.649 --> 50:55.693
Smeargle's scent...

50:56.912 --> 50:59.523
You mean Smeargle ink?

51:02.091 --> 51:03.049
It can't be...

51:04.789 --> 51:06.748
I initially thought
it just slid off the table,

51:06.748 --> 51:07.879
but now...

51:07.879 --> 51:10.186
Somebody stole it!

51:10.186 --> 51:12.841
I can't be sure,
but if that's what happened...

51:16.018 --> 51:19.630
You see, Smeargle uses
its ink to mark its territory.

51:19.630 --> 51:22.894
I thought I can use it
for marking, but the chemical

51:22.894 --> 51:25.245
is invisible after
distilling its essence.

51:25.245 --> 51:27.290
Except this
light reveals it.

51:31.381 --> 51:32.600
There. Case in point.

51:32.600 --> 51:33.601
Incredible.

51:33.601 --> 51:34.776
You did it, Pikachu!

51:36.256 --> 51:38.040
If we follow these,
it should lead us straight

51:38.040 --> 51:39.302
to the culprit.

51:39.302 --> 51:40.303
Then let's go!

51:51.271 --> 51:52.707
Wonder if it's
been called off.

51:54.448 --> 51:56.102
It's all right!

51:56.102 --> 51:57.494
I'll protect
you this time.

52:03.283 --> 52:04.675
Huh...

52:04.675 --> 52:06.199
Who knew there was a place

52:06.199 --> 52:08.592
like this in Fula City?

52:08.592 --> 52:10.551
Let's hurry
up and find that rare Pokémon!

52:10.551 --> 52:12.118
There are a lot of Trainers

52:12.118 --> 52:13.554
who saw that video...

52:13.554 --> 52:14.729
Yeah.

52:14.729 --> 52:16.557
Zeraora,
they're after it!

52:19.299 --> 52:20.735
Hey, there!

52:20.735 --> 52:23.041
What are you two guys doing
all the way out here?

52:23.041 --> 52:25.653
Hi, little
girl! You from Fula City?

52:25.653 --> 52:27.350
Have you ever seen any Pokémon

52:27.350 --> 52:28.438
you don't see anywhere else?

52:28.438 --> 52:29.526
Sure I have!

52:29.526 --> 52:30.527
You mean it?

52:30.527 --> 52:31.572
So where?!

52:31.572 --> 52:33.487
Uh...that way!

52:33.487 --> 52:35.228
I never saw one like it!

52:35.228 --> 52:37.055
Thanks for
your help, sweet heart!

52:37.055 --> 52:38.492
You're welcome. Any time.

52:43.888 --> 52:45.194
What's that?

52:45.194 --> 52:46.717
A Ditto and a Teddiursa.

52:46.717 --> 52:48.676
No don't!!

52:51.069 --> 52:53.289
If you don't hurry,
that rare Pokémon will get away!

52:53.289 --> 52:54.290
Quick!

52:55.770 --> 52:56.858
We'll just take these two first.

52:56.858 --> 52:57.859
Houndoom,
go!

52:57.859 --> 52:58.816
Go, Sneasel!

53:03.952 --> 53:05.171
Houndoom,
use Flamethrower!!

53:05.171 --> 53:06.084
Sneasel, use Icy Wind!

53:16.573 --> 53:18.619
Hide, Zeraora! Hurry up!

53:18.619 --> 53:20.055
Hey, I've never seen

53:20.055 --> 53:21.230
that Pokémon before!

53:21.230 --> 53:22.362
It's the rare one!

53:22.362 --> 53:23.624
Use Fire Fang!

53:23.624 --> 53:24.799
Use Slash!

53:36.027 --> 53:38.073
Zeraora! It's too much!

53:38.073 --> 53:40.075
Your wounds
still haven't healed yet!

53:40.075 --> 53:41.555
Wow, it's fast!

53:41.555 --> 53:42.599
Hey but it looks like

53:42.599 --> 53:43.905
it's already wounded.

53:43.905 --> 53:46.168
Yeah, now's our chance!

53:46.168 --> 53:47.561
Sneasel, Ice Shard!

53:53.131 --> 53:54.611
All right, Houndoom!

53:54.611 --> 53:55.743
Follow that with Flamethrower!

54:07.407 --> 54:08.451
Zeraora!

54:09.887 --> 54:12.847
Zeraora! Wake up!
Zeraora? They'll catch you!!

54:12.847 --> 54:14.065
Time to wrap this up.

54:24.119 --> 54:25.207
What?!

54:27.992 --> 54:29.342
You okay, Margo?

54:30.778 --> 54:32.867
You were awesome
all by yourself.

54:32.867 --> 54:33.824
Ash, you're here...

54:35.435 --> 54:36.871
Father...

54:36.871 --> 54:38.264
Everyone...

54:38.264 --> 54:40.353
I am the
mayor of Fula City!

54:40.353 --> 54:42.137
Choose
your next move wisely,

54:42.137 --> 54:44.531
or I'll take legal action!

54:44.531 --> 54:45.662
What do you think?

54:45.662 --> 54:46.446
I think we leave.

54:49.187 --> 54:50.537
Hey, you!

54:50.537 --> 54:52.495
Following
them would be dumb!

54:52.495 --> 54:53.453
Stay here.

54:57.065 --> 54:58.588
Oh, Father...

54:58.588 --> 55:01.722
It isn't Zeraora's fault!
I did everything!

55:03.071 --> 55:04.594
That's Zeraora?

55:04.594 --> 55:05.726
Yeah.

55:05.726 --> 55:07.336
The stories
said it vanished.

55:07.336 --> 55:08.946
But there it is,
in the flesh.

55:13.124 --> 55:14.430
This is it...isn't it?

55:16.867 --> 55:19.783
Do you have any idea how
much trouble you have caused?

55:19.783 --> 55:20.741
For everyone.

55:22.351 --> 55:23.439
Margo...

55:25.833 --> 55:29.706
It's only been a little
while since I first met Zeraora.

55:29.706 --> 55:31.534
I was playing with
the Pokémon in the foothills

55:31.534 --> 55:32.970
of the mountain...

55:32.970 --> 55:34.929
Suddenly,
there was a rockslide.

55:37.714 --> 55:41.065
I should have been
crushed by that boulder.

55:41.065 --> 55:44.634
Zeraora is the one
who protected me back then.

55:44.634 --> 55:48.595
But by doing that,
Zeraora was badly hurt!

55:50.336 --> 55:52.425
It was all my fault!

55:52.425 --> 55:56.385
So I vowed to
help make it well again!

55:56.385 --> 56:00.128
Everybody in town
seems to be so afraid of it.

56:00.128 --> 56:02.478
I thought that at
least I could be its friend...

56:02.478 --> 56:05.786
...and take care of it
until it was all better again.

56:05.786 --> 56:08.832
But then they said
someone knew of a rare Pokémon.

56:12.880 --> 56:17.014
And I knew...that
everybody would try to catch it.

56:17.014 --> 56:19.495
That's when...I thought
that if the Wind Festival

56:19.495 --> 56:21.715
was called off...

56:21.715 --> 56:23.891
I knew it would
cause problems if the eternal

56:23.891 --> 56:25.632
flame was taken...

56:25.632 --> 56:27.373
But I was gonna
put it back the minute the

56:27.373 --> 56:29.113
festival was canceled!

56:33.291 --> 56:36.599
I'm sorry!
I'm really, really sorry!

56:37.383 --> 56:38.514
Margo...

56:43.867 --> 56:45.086
Margo...

56:45.086 --> 56:48.481
Thank you
for protecting Zeraora.

56:48.481 --> 56:50.874
There's something
I need to talk to you about.

56:52.180 --> 56:54.051
Regarding
the truth about Zeraora.

56:56.184 --> 56:59.709
Zeraora lived in
this area for a long time.

56:59.709 --> 57:03.409
It was master of
the land, beloved by Pokémon.

57:03.409 --> 57:05.802
And they
all lived in peace.

57:05.802 --> 57:07.848
So what did we humans do?

57:07.848 --> 57:11.199
We cut down the forests
that were home to the Pokémon...

57:11.199 --> 57:14.071
Looking
to enrich our lives.

57:14.071 --> 57:16.900
The reason for the
mountain fire? We did it.

57:16.900 --> 57:18.467
That was fifty short years ago.

57:21.427 --> 57:23.037
No way...

57:23.037 --> 57:24.908
Fire was everywhere!

57:24.908 --> 57:27.563
And people never
thought for a moment of

57:27.563 --> 57:28.912
the wild Pokémon living there.

57:30.566 --> 57:33.134
Everyone was in a panic.

57:33.134 --> 57:36.572
But Zeraora was the only
one who never gave up on saving

57:36.572 --> 57:38.835
the many Pokémon left behind.

57:38.835 --> 57:41.316
Ever since,
Zeraora has been deeply

57:41.316 --> 57:44.058
angry with humankind.

57:44.058 --> 57:46.060
I see. That's why.

57:46.060 --> 57:49.542
You see, people
did things that made Zeraora

57:49.542 --> 57:50.978
trust them less and less.

57:50.978 --> 57:54.111
All Zeraora wanted
was to live in peace

57:54.111 --> 57:55.896
with the forest Pokémon.

57:55.896 --> 57:59.203
But huge numbers
of Trainers gathered in

57:59.203 --> 58:00.944
the forest to catch Zeraora!

58:03.425 --> 58:05.383
The previous mayor,
wishing to make up for

58:05.383 --> 58:08.299
this injustice, decided
to lie to the townspeople.

58:08.299 --> 58:11.085
He said that Zeraora had
vanished, and the mountain was

58:11.085 --> 58:14.958
cursed. He forbade anyone from
entering the mountain again.

58:14.958 --> 58:18.179
He did it hoping to
protect Zeraora. It was the only

58:18.179 --> 58:20.137
thing people could think to do.

58:20.137 --> 58:22.052
That explains it...

58:22.052 --> 58:26.404
Very few people
know about it. Very, very few.

58:26.404 --> 58:28.319
And even
fewer young people.

58:28.319 --> 58:30.278
And that's...

58:30.278 --> 58:32.106
...the truth about Zeraora.

58:42.812 --> 58:44.422
What was that?

58:46.555 --> 58:47.948
Smoke...

58:47.948 --> 58:50.080
It could be related
to the Wind Festival...

58:50.080 --> 58:51.517
No.

58:55.956 --> 58:57.827
That doesn't look good...

58:57.827 --> 58:58.741
Here it comes!

59:00.003 --> 59:00.961
What was that?!

59:03.703 --> 59:06.009
Oh no...
It just can't be...

59:06.009 --> 59:08.142
Wait.
Do you know about this?

59:17.151 --> 59:20.110
The color of the
smoke...and these symptoms...

59:20.110 --> 59:22.243
It's possible
that this is Effect Spore...

59:22.243 --> 59:23.723
Hey,
Team Rocket stole that!

59:24.941 --> 59:27.640
Correct. Chansey,
use Aromatherapy.

59:29.511 --> 59:32.470
Tell me about this
Effect Spore... What is it?

59:32.470 --> 59:34.908
I was in the
process of researching it.

59:34.908 --> 59:37.301
Since it's a chemical
version of the Ability, Effect

59:37.301 --> 59:38.868
Spore, I kept it in a capsule.

59:40.261 --> 59:41.741
What does that have
to do with these Pidgey?

59:43.264 --> 59:45.745
When you breathe in
that chemical, it becomes a

59:45.745 --> 59:47.485
poison that numbs your body.

59:47.485 --> 59:48.965
That's what the smoke was.

59:48.965 --> 59:50.706
Why would
you ever make that?

59:50.706 --> 59:53.927
During my research, I
found that it's also effective

59:53.927 --> 59:55.189
against certain human diseases.

59:58.018 --> 59:59.149
Yes, it's me.

59:59.149 --> 01:00:00.977
Your Honor,
I have a report.

01:00:00.977 --> 01:00:03.501
There's been an
outbreak of an unknown smoke,

01:00:03.501 --> 01:00:05.199
engulfing a quarter
of Fula City.

01:00:05.199 --> 01:00:06.679
It's
spreading as we speak.

01:00:06.679 --> 01:00:09.290
Anyone who breathes
it experiences numbness,

01:00:09.290 --> 01:00:11.771
so we classified it as a poison.

01:00:11.771 --> 01:00:14.208
We have also
ordered emergency evacuation

01:00:14.208 --> 01:00:15.818
of all affected areas.

01:00:15.818 --> 01:00:17.211
There's
not a moment to lose!

01:00:17.211 --> 01:00:19.126
Please return to the city!

01:00:19.126 --> 01:00:20.214
Understood.

01:00:21.563 --> 01:00:22.956
Oh, no, Father...

01:00:25.523 --> 01:00:26.960
It's all my fault.

01:00:36.709 --> 01:00:40.016
Let's go! Watching
won't help anything!

01:00:40.016 --> 01:00:42.976
So whaddaya say we
go and protect Fula City?!

01:00:45.805 --> 01:00:47.110
Easier said than done,
but how do we do that?

01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:49.678
We've all got Pokémon
partners! Right by our sides!

01:00:52.376 --> 01:00:54.378
Whatever you can't do, you
can do it with a Pokémon pal!

01:00:57.077 --> 01:00:58.426
When you're with a Pokémon,
it's like your muscles and your

01:00:58.426 --> 01:00:59.732
mind get a lot stronger!

01:00:59.732 --> 01:01:02.212
And that's
called--Pokémon power!!

01:01:05.738 --> 01:01:08.828
What does
"Pokémon power" mean?

01:01:12.005 --> 01:01:13.441
Pokémon power, huh?

01:01:16.705 --> 01:01:18.489
Right. Let's do it!

01:01:18.489 --> 01:01:20.056
That's the spirit!

01:01:20.056 --> 01:01:23.538
Professor, is there
any way to disperse the smoke?

01:01:23.538 --> 01:01:27.542
Now let's see. I could
go back to the lab and produce

01:01:27.542 --> 01:01:29.762
large quantities of the
essence of the Pokémon

01:01:29.762 --> 01:01:30.893
Ability Natural Cure...

01:01:30.893 --> 01:01:32.547
But it's no use!

01:01:32.547 --> 01:01:35.419
There's no way to spread
it throughout the city!

01:01:35.419 --> 01:01:37.378
What about
using the wind to do it?

01:01:37.378 --> 01:01:38.640
The wind?

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.250
There's the
old generating station.

01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:41.643
You're right....

01:01:41.643 --> 01:01:43.645
But wait, I thought
that it was broken down.

01:01:43.645 --> 01:01:46.213
Harriet? If you
can't fix it, no one can!

01:01:46.213 --> 01:01:47.214
What do you mean?

01:01:50.826 --> 01:01:53.524
You see,
I built that power plant.

01:01:53.524 --> 01:01:56.266
Granny, that is so cool!

01:01:56.266 --> 01:01:59.922
I built the propeller
so it could run backward, too.

01:01:59.922 --> 01:02:01.837
If you run it in reverse,

01:02:01.837 --> 01:02:03.447
it will cause wind to blow.

01:02:03.447 --> 01:02:06.015
Question is,
will it still spin?

01:02:06.015 --> 01:02:07.451
I give it
a fifty-fifty chance.

01:02:08.322 --> 01:02:09.497
Fifty-fifty?

01:02:09.497 --> 01:02:10.672
Yes! We can do this!

01:02:12.413 --> 01:02:14.371
You scamps
will have to help, too!

01:02:14.371 --> 01:02:16.025
We're going to need
some muscle!

01:02:17.766 --> 01:02:19.289
Very well.

01:02:19.289 --> 01:02:20.856
Toren and Harriet, you need
to go to the power plant.

01:02:20.856 --> 01:02:23.598
Risa, Margo, and I are
going to stay here, and treat

01:02:23.598 --> 01:02:27.471
Zeraora and the wild Pokémon,
then we'll lead them to safety.

01:02:27.471 --> 01:02:29.952
Smoke is heavier
than air, so the tops of

01:02:29.952 --> 01:02:32.172
the mountains should be safe.

01:02:32.172 --> 01:02:34.609
And take this.
Super Potion.

01:02:34.609 --> 01:02:36.742
It will help
heal injured Pokémon.

01:02:36.742 --> 01:02:38.439
Thank you, Toren!

01:02:38.439 --> 01:02:39.788
All right, everyone...

01:02:39.788 --> 01:02:41.181
Good luck to you!

01:02:43.836 --> 01:02:45.576
Remain calm and orderly!

01:02:45.576 --> 01:02:46.882
Evacuate as quickly as possible!

01:02:50.625 --> 01:02:53.889
Mia, where are you?!
Is Kellie all right?!

01:02:53.889 --> 01:02:56.283
She's fine.
We're both doing just fine.

01:02:56.283 --> 01:02:58.851
We're on the gondola ride.

01:02:58.851 --> 01:03:01.157
We seem to have
come to an emergency stop.

01:03:01.157 --> 01:03:03.594
It hasn't moved in a while.

01:03:03.594 --> 01:03:06.206
Uncle Callahan! Help us...

01:03:06.206 --> 01:03:08.382
Kellie! Mia!

01:03:13.169 --> 01:03:14.083
How can I help them?

01:03:18.609 --> 01:03:20.046
So stupid...

01:03:22.004 --> 01:03:24.572
Such a stupid liar!

01:03:33.015 --> 01:03:34.451
I told you to go away...

01:03:37.193 --> 01:03:38.455
What's with you?!

01:03:40.501 --> 01:03:43.112
What do
you think we can do?

01:03:43.112 --> 01:03:47.073
All I ever
do is lie, then run away.

01:03:47.073 --> 01:03:49.989
We're weak.
Both of us.

01:03:54.645 --> 01:03:56.909
Hey!
What's that for? Stop!

01:03:59.781 --> 01:04:02.566
But why?

01:04:10.357 --> 01:04:11.271
Sudowoodo...

01:04:15.449 --> 01:04:16.842
You're not lying.

01:04:16.842 --> 01:04:18.669
You're actually
willing to help me.

01:04:28.070 --> 01:04:29.942
Thank you. Sudowoodo.

01:04:34.468 --> 01:04:36.513
I'm taking back my pledge.

01:04:36.513 --> 01:04:38.994
I'll do
whatever it takes...

01:04:38.994 --> 01:04:41.344
If it helps to
keep the ones I love safe!

01:04:43.216 --> 01:04:44.826
Together
we can't be beat!

01:04:46.175 --> 01:04:48.134
We'll save
Kellie and Mia as a team!

01:04:50.788 --> 01:04:53.052
Say what?!
Now you tell me!

01:04:55.532 --> 01:04:56.577
Status!

01:04:56.577 --> 01:04:57.839
Right.

01:04:57.839 --> 01:04:59.406
More than
half the city is already

01:04:59.406 --> 01:05:01.103
engulfed in smoke.

01:05:01.103 --> 01:05:03.627
We are sending
evacuees to the Pokémon Center,

01:05:03.627 --> 01:05:05.673
but it won't be enough.

01:05:05.673 --> 01:05:08.589
Mr. Mayor,
what are our countermeasures?

01:05:08.589 --> 01:05:09.851
We'll use Pokémon power!

01:05:16.292 --> 01:05:17.293
Toren!

01:05:17.293 --> 01:05:18.555
Where have you been?

01:05:18.555 --> 01:05:20.514
We've been given
evacuation orders, too.

01:05:20.514 --> 01:05:22.124
I see. Sorry.

01:05:22.124 --> 01:05:24.300
Give us a hand with these
research materials would ya.

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:27.651
What's the matter?

01:05:27.651 --> 01:05:29.740
Toren, are you listening?

01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:31.655
No. I mean...

01:05:36.269 --> 01:05:37.879
Pokémon power.

01:05:37.879 --> 01:05:40.273
Pokémon power.
Pokémon power! Pokémon power!

01:05:40.273 --> 01:05:42.101
Toren,
would you hurry, time's up!

01:05:42.101 --> 01:05:44.190
Listen to me, NOW!

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:46.844
I know you all hate me!

01:05:46.844 --> 01:05:50.196
I easily get flustered,
and I can't always speak!

01:05:50.196 --> 01:05:52.850
You probably think
of me as some weirdo!

01:05:52.850 --> 01:05:55.114
But right now,
I really need your help!

01:05:55.114 --> 01:05:57.812
There's still a way for
us to save our home!

01:05:57.812 --> 01:05:59.335
I won't run!

01:05:59.335 --> 01:06:01.816
I want to use my research
to save people and Pokémon!

01:06:08.170 --> 01:06:09.171
Toren?

01:06:09.171 --> 01:06:10.172
What?!

01:06:10.172 --> 01:06:11.782
You're always like this.

01:06:11.782 --> 01:06:15.090
Always putting other
people and Pokémon first.

01:06:15.090 --> 01:06:16.787
This time is no different.

01:06:16.787 --> 01:06:19.312
I respect you as a researcher.

01:06:19.312 --> 01:06:22.271
So what do you want
us to do? We'll help you.

01:06:22.271 --> 01:06:23.881
Whatever it is,
you know we'll get it done!

01:06:23.881 --> 01:06:25.231
Just say the word.

01:06:25.231 --> 01:06:26.406
Let us know what you need.

01:06:27.581 --> 01:06:28.712
You mean it?

01:06:34.109 --> 01:06:36.372
I want to make
massive quantities of the

01:06:36.372 --> 01:06:37.852
essence of Natural Cure!

01:06:37.852 --> 01:06:40.986
You heard him!
Let's get started right away!

01:06:40.986 --> 01:06:44.032
There it is! That's the one!

01:06:44.032 --> 01:06:45.555
Where is it hiding?

01:06:45.555 --> 01:06:48.602
Come out, Zeraora!

01:06:48.602 --> 01:06:50.691
Don't let it escape! Catch it!

01:06:53.694 --> 01:06:54.825
All done.

01:06:56.349 --> 01:06:57.350
Zeraora, you're awake!

01:06:58.655 --> 01:06:59.743
It's okay.
The bad men are gone now!

01:07:00.744 --> 01:07:01.832
Margo, wait!

01:07:07.969 --> 01:07:09.449
Zeraora, it's okay!

01:07:09.449 --> 01:07:10.754
We don't wanna hurt you!

01:07:20.373 --> 01:07:21.374
Well, I got it.

01:07:21.374 --> 01:07:22.375
Where's the professor?

01:07:22.375 --> 01:07:23.985
He hasn't arrived yet.

01:07:23.985 --> 01:07:27.815
Hey! What do I do
to get rid of all that smoke?!

01:07:27.815 --> 01:07:29.164
Well, it's you!

01:07:29.164 --> 01:07:30.557
Granny?

01:07:30.557 --> 01:07:31.819
So, we want to
get the former power plant

01:07:31.819 --> 01:07:33.168
to disperse the poison.

01:07:33.168 --> 01:07:34.604
Kellie is in danger!

01:07:34.604 --> 01:07:36.693
So let's get to that
formal whatever it is!

01:07:38.826 --> 01:07:39.914
What was that?

01:07:43.961 --> 01:07:45.485
It's by the transformer.

01:07:45.485 --> 01:07:49.576
It could be the
smoke caused a short circuit...

01:07:51.665 --> 01:07:52.753
Granny!

01:07:54.972 --> 01:07:56.539
The power's going out...

01:07:59.716 --> 01:08:01.675
We've gotta get
outta here or we're toast!

01:08:01.675 --> 01:08:04.069
Nothing changes, DOES IT?!

01:08:06.288 --> 01:08:07.507
Hurry up! Come on!

01:08:12.773 --> 01:08:14.296
We made it...

01:08:14.296 --> 01:08:15.602
It follows
that we're saved...

01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:19.736
It's a power outage!

01:08:19.736 --> 01:08:21.346
No, you can't!

01:08:21.346 --> 01:08:24.611
Not after all the work we've
done! Please, I'm begging you...

01:08:29.790 --> 01:08:31.399
What is it, Chansey?

01:08:35.839 --> 01:08:37.711
Granny!
Are you all right?!

01:08:37.711 --> 01:08:39.452
Prepare
a bed for her. Quickly!

01:08:39.452 --> 01:08:40.496
Sir!

01:08:40.496 --> 01:08:41.801
Don't bother. I'm fine.

01:08:43.586 --> 01:08:46.328
We can't wait for
the professor, so let's go!

01:08:46.328 --> 01:08:48.809
We'll need time
to get that junk started.

01:08:48.809 --> 01:08:51.986
Okay, then let's go!
I'll take you there!

01:08:51.986 --> 01:08:53.640
Right after toxic smoke

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:55.642
appeared in town, a power
transformer exploded,

01:08:55.642 --> 01:08:56.729
creating a gigantic
mountain fire!

01:08:56.729 --> 01:08:57.861
Here you go.

01:08:57.861 --> 01:08:59.254
Thanks a lot.

01:08:59.254 --> 01:09:00.560
The power's out, plunging

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.604
the area into total darkness!

01:09:02.604 --> 01:09:04.477
To everyone in Fula City,

01:09:04.477 --> 01:09:05.826
be careful!

01:09:12.832 --> 01:09:13.834
Zeraora?

01:09:21.276 --> 01:09:22.537
Where do you think it went?

01:09:22.537 --> 01:09:24.584
It went to rescue
the Pokémon there...

01:09:28.718 --> 01:09:29.850
Wait!

01:09:29.850 --> 01:09:30.894
Risa!

01:09:30.894 --> 01:09:32.548
I'll go after Margo!

01:09:32.548 --> 01:09:34.071
You've gotta get that
back to where it belongs!

01:09:34.071 --> 01:09:35.682
And call Lugia!

01:09:36.551 --> 01:09:38.118
Wait a minute!

01:09:38.118 --> 01:09:40.817
Nobody can get it over
there faster than you, Risa!

01:09:42.210 --> 01:09:44.037
It's something
only you can do!

01:09:45.779 --> 01:09:47.127
You can do this!

01:09:47.127 --> 01:09:48.173
I know it!

01:09:49.216 --> 01:09:50.261
I really can't!

01:09:50.261 --> 01:09:51.263
I mean...

01:09:51.263 --> 01:09:53.090
I can't...

01:09:53.090 --> 01:09:55.005
...run anymore...

01:09:59.923 --> 01:10:01.229
Eevee!

01:10:15.069 --> 01:10:18.028
Why do you keep
trying so hard?!

01:10:33.522 --> 01:10:35.350
I mean...

01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:38.353
What you can't do on
your own, you can do with a

01:10:38.353 --> 01:10:40.703
Pokémon pal there by your side!

01:10:45.012 --> 01:10:47.057
Together...

01:10:51.061 --> 01:10:54.195
With a Pokémon...
I can do anything...

01:10:55.805 --> 01:10:58.982
You showed me just
how determined you are...

01:10:58.982 --> 01:11:00.810
So I have to be the same.

01:11:05.032 --> 01:11:06.642
This time,
it's my turn to try hard!

01:11:09.254 --> 01:11:11.778
Let's deliver it.
Together!

01:11:13.258 --> 01:11:14.650
Right!

01:11:28.534 --> 01:11:29.622
Come here!

01:11:30.797 --> 01:11:32.059
Now hang on tight...

01:11:35.932 --> 01:11:38.283
Get ready
for our Pokémon power!!

01:11:53.907 --> 01:11:55.169
I've got to think!

01:11:55.169 --> 01:11:57.040
Think! Think!

01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:59.434
I've got the knowledge
if I can just THINK!

01:11:59.434 --> 01:12:03.090
I've got to think harder
than anyone in the world!

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:07.877
Lum Berries? That's it!

01:12:07.877 --> 01:12:08.965
Excuse me!

01:12:10.271 --> 01:12:12.142
It's these!
They can do it!

01:12:12.142 --> 01:12:14.144
May I please
have all these berries?

01:12:14.144 --> 01:12:15.581
To save the city!

01:12:17.626 --> 01:12:19.976
Just a little longer...

01:12:19.976 --> 01:12:22.501
It'll be okay.

01:12:22.501 --> 01:12:25.678
Uncle Callahan
will come and save us!

01:12:25.678 --> 01:12:28.463
Got it. So we just
have to get the place running.

01:12:28.463 --> 01:12:30.378
Then we use
it to spread out the

01:12:30.378 --> 01:12:31.553
professor's chemicals.

01:12:31.553 --> 01:12:32.641
You've got
a way with words.

01:12:36.079 --> 01:12:37.342
What's
this supposed to be?

01:12:39.866 --> 01:12:42.825
The only thing we can
do is find a different route.

01:12:42.825 --> 01:12:45.480
But isn't
the old power plant that

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:47.177
big rusty thing up there?

01:12:47.177 --> 01:12:49.702
Let's spray all
of it and bust through!

01:12:49.702 --> 01:12:50.877
No, you can't!

01:12:50.877 --> 01:12:52.139
I won't permit that!

01:12:53.575 --> 01:12:54.881
What's the matter,
Granny?

01:12:56.839 --> 01:12:58.667
It was this hand...

01:12:58.667 --> 01:13:00.190
If I held
it out a little more...

01:13:02.105 --> 01:13:04.107
YOUNG Snubbull!
Come back here!

01:13:04.107 --> 01:13:05.500
YOUNG Snubbull!!

01:13:10.026 --> 01:13:11.419
YOUNG This way! Hurry!

01:13:13.813 --> 01:13:16.424
YOUNG Snubbull!!

01:13:19.079 --> 01:13:21.603
I should
never have let it get away!

01:13:21.603 --> 01:13:23.170
Granny!

01:13:23.170 --> 01:13:25.868
Get it together!
I don't know about the past...

01:13:25.868 --> 01:13:27.609
...but we're with you now!

01:13:42.319 --> 01:13:45.061
Thank you, Snubbull!

01:13:45.061 --> 01:13:47.368
My beloved,
you protected the key.

01:13:47.368 --> 01:13:50.545
You probably did it just
for this very moment!

01:13:50.545 --> 01:13:53.418
So, now it's my turn!

01:13:53.418 --> 01:13:56.421
Scamps!
Will you do this with me?

01:13:59.249 --> 01:14:01.469
Then let's all
show 'em what for!

01:14:01.469 --> 01:14:02.731
Give 'em
our Pokémon power!!

01:14:08.955 --> 01:14:10.304
Can you hit it
from the air?

01:14:45.861 --> 01:14:47.080
Right!

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:48.429
Whatever
else it may have done,

01:14:48.429 --> 01:14:50.039
it managed to open up a path!

01:14:59.092 --> 01:15:00.354
What'll I do?

01:15:00.354 --> 01:15:02.835
If I just keep
running from the smoke,

01:15:02.835 --> 01:15:03.966
I'll never get there!

01:15:05.185 --> 01:15:06.273
Risa!

01:15:06.273 --> 01:15:07.361
Rick?!

01:15:07.361 --> 01:15:09.102
I'll be your navigator!

01:15:09.102 --> 01:15:11.713
I'm searching for a route
to the eternal flame pedestal

01:15:11.713 --> 01:15:13.410
that keeps you out of the smoke!

01:15:13.410 --> 01:15:14.977
Found it!

01:15:14.977 --> 01:15:16.413
Why are you doing this?

01:15:16.413 --> 01:15:19.112
Hold on! Just how
do you know where I am?!

01:15:19.112 --> 01:15:20.548
Never mind!
Just keep running!

01:15:20.548 --> 01:15:21.810
Right!

01:15:21.810 --> 01:15:23.595
See the woods
in front of you? Go in!

01:15:23.595 --> 01:15:24.987
It should slow down the smoke!

01:15:24.987 --> 01:15:25.945
Right!

01:15:45.791 --> 01:15:46.966
Zeraora!

01:15:49.621 --> 01:15:50.709
I knew it!

01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:56.497
Look out!!

01:15:59.544 --> 01:16:00.545
I'm all right!

01:16:01.894 --> 01:16:04.723
You hate people, right?

01:16:04.723 --> 01:16:06.333
You can't trust us, right?

01:16:07.464 --> 01:16:11.294
That's
a lonely way to live.

01:16:11.294 --> 01:16:14.776
Don't you think?
So I want to be your friend!

01:16:18.432 --> 01:16:19.912
Yeah...

01:16:21.870 --> 01:16:22.958
So stubborn...

01:16:26.179 --> 01:16:27.833
Pikachu, use Thunderbolt!

01:16:31.576 --> 01:16:33.229
Pikachu, Iron Tail!

01:16:40.541 --> 01:16:41.847
Use Quick Attack!

01:16:55.077 --> 01:16:56.383
We did it!

01:16:56.383 --> 01:16:58.951
All right!
We did it, we did it!

01:16:59.908 --> 01:17:01.040
Toren!

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:02.084
The mayor
sent a car. It's here.

01:17:06.785 --> 01:17:08.264
Your Honor!

01:17:08.264 --> 01:17:09.309
Preparations are complete.

01:17:10.092 --> 01:17:11.093
Good.

01:17:13.487 --> 01:17:15.663
This is
countermeasure headquarters.

01:17:15.663 --> 01:17:18.100
We request
everyone evacuate due

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:19.754
to the Effect Spore smoke.

01:17:19.754 --> 01:17:23.149
If there are any people
or Pokémon that are in need of

01:17:23.149 --> 01:17:26.195
assistance, I'm asking for
those nearby to give them

01:17:26.195 --> 01:17:28.284
whatever assistance they can.

01:17:28.284 --> 01:17:31.723
We have also dispatched
a countermeasures team to help

01:17:31.723 --> 01:17:33.159
solve further problems.

01:17:33.159 --> 01:17:35.378
We will spare no
effort to make the citizens

01:17:35.378 --> 01:17:37.642
of our fair city safe again!

01:17:39.469 --> 01:17:41.950
I'd also like to
take this opportunity to

01:17:41.950 --> 01:17:43.735
make a request, as mayor.

01:17:43.735 --> 01:17:45.475
The outbreak of
the Effect Spore smoke

01:17:45.475 --> 01:17:47.869
has caused a mountain fire.

01:17:47.869 --> 01:17:50.959
Once our team's plan
is in place, I ask that as

01:17:50.959 --> 01:17:53.658
many of you as possible
please join me...

01:17:53.658 --> 01:17:55.660
...in working to
help us put out the fire.

01:17:58.750 --> 01:18:01.927
For many years,
our city has lived a lie.

01:18:01.927 --> 01:18:04.799
But this time,
I would like for the people

01:18:04.799 --> 01:18:07.759
of this town, together with the
Pokémon always by our sides...

01:18:07.759 --> 01:18:11.545
...to join hands
in fighting this fire!

01:18:11.545 --> 01:18:14.026
This place is unbelievable!

01:18:14.026 --> 01:18:16.158
So how do
you intend to get it

01:18:16.158 --> 01:18:17.377
running without electricity?

01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:20.119
With this!

01:18:23.644 --> 01:18:25.428
Would you look at that?

01:18:26.473 --> 01:18:27.866
Good boy!

01:18:29.432 --> 01:18:31.304
Is she serious?

01:18:33.610 --> 01:18:35.351
Now it's
time for brute strength!

01:18:35.351 --> 01:18:37.353
We're gonna need
everybody on this!

01:18:37.353 --> 01:18:40.661
Listen up! You have
to push that all at once!

01:18:40.661 --> 01:18:43.620
Wait, Granny!
This runs on muscle power?!

01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:46.275
You have
some other power handy?

01:18:46.275 --> 01:18:47.668
You're kidding...

01:18:47.668 --> 01:18:50.453
Hey! Don't
just stand there! Positions!

01:18:53.630 --> 01:18:54.675
And we're off!

01:18:55.676 --> 01:18:56.764
All together now...

01:18:57.809 --> 01:18:59.419
And...go!

01:19:00.986 --> 01:19:02.596
And...push!

01:19:04.467 --> 01:19:05.425
Okay...

01:19:38.719 --> 01:19:40.329
YEAH!

01:19:43.463 --> 01:19:45.204
Pikachu, are you okay?

01:19:50.252 --> 01:19:52.951
Zeraora!
Please stop this, please?

01:19:52.951 --> 01:19:55.257
Deep down,
you know it's true...

01:19:55.257 --> 01:19:57.172
You know there are
people who aren't so bad!

01:19:58.130 --> 01:20:00.001
Please trust us!

01:20:07.748 --> 01:20:09.184
Zeraora!!

01:20:16.104 --> 01:20:17.323
Oh, no!

01:20:47.266 --> 01:20:48.658
Pikachu...

01:20:48.658 --> 01:20:51.487
All right!
Glad everyone's safe!

01:20:51.487 --> 01:20:54.142
Hey Ash! You scared us!

01:20:56.231 --> 01:20:57.450
Zeraora...

01:21:03.456 --> 01:21:05.371
Good.

01:21:05.371 --> 01:21:07.590
Now we're friends, right?

01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:09.723
Sorry to
keep you waiting!

01:21:11.856 --> 01:21:12.944
I finished it. See?

01:21:12.944 --> 01:21:14.597
Callahan?

01:21:14.597 --> 01:21:18.253
Oh, Professor, look
at this! I got this lump moving!

01:21:18.253 --> 01:21:19.864
That can't be the truth!

01:21:19.864 --> 01:21:21.474
Let's call
it a half-truth!

01:21:21.474 --> 01:21:24.694
This is incredible!
I can see this working.

01:21:24.694 --> 01:21:26.131
It'll work!

01:21:26.131 --> 01:21:28.350
Now, to spread
this onto the propellers...

01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:30.483
Leave it to me.

01:21:30.483 --> 01:21:31.788
I can throw it.

01:21:31.788 --> 01:21:33.399
Now wait just a minute!

01:21:33.399 --> 01:21:36.010
You're, you're going to
throw this into that?!

01:21:36.010 --> 01:21:37.403
What about a ladder?

01:21:37.403 --> 01:21:39.013
The ladders
all got burned up!

01:21:39.013 --> 01:21:40.580
Great...

01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:43.713
Professor.
Come on. This is the only way.

01:21:43.713 --> 01:21:46.020
What's going on?!

01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:48.370
Okay, gang!
Get this moving again!

01:21:48.370 --> 01:21:50.459
This time
we'll turn the propeller!

01:21:50.459 --> 01:21:52.505
Callahan...
my colleagues put all their

01:21:52.505 --> 01:21:55.421
efforts into making this,
and it's all that exists!

01:21:55.421 --> 01:21:57.292
Okay, I get it.

01:21:57.292 --> 01:21:59.381
I'll make sure
it gets there for the sake

01:21:59.381 --> 01:22:00.513
of my little Kellie!

01:22:05.039 --> 01:22:07.476
Right!
Push with all your might!

01:22:19.271 --> 01:22:20.620
This looks pretty bad.

01:22:22.535 --> 01:22:25.146
All this debris will
break the ball before it even

01:22:25.146 --> 01:22:26.321
gets to the propeller.

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:30.412
Do you know
a different way?

01:22:38.072 --> 01:22:39.987
I trust you...

01:22:39.987 --> 01:22:41.293
...partner!

01:22:49.562 --> 01:22:51.651
Now,
give it everything you got!

01:22:53.783 --> 01:22:56.830
Now turn, baby, turn!!

01:23:10.583 --> 01:23:11.932
Look at that...

01:23:13.064 --> 01:23:14.630
It worked!

01:23:18.025 --> 01:23:20.375
The city's people
and Pokémon need to know

01:23:20.375 --> 01:23:21.463
of this right away!

01:23:21.463 --> 01:23:22.595
Yes sir.

01:23:24.162 --> 01:23:26.555
This is some blast!

01:23:26.555 --> 01:23:27.556
Toren did it!

01:23:34.607 --> 01:23:36.261
Hey! Look outside!

01:23:39.699 --> 01:23:41.875
What do you know?
They all did it!

01:23:44.095 --> 01:23:45.531
Professor,
did you see that?

01:23:45.531 --> 01:23:47.794
Of course I did!
It was incredible! One shot!

01:23:47.794 --> 01:23:49.404
You're a genius!

01:23:51.537 --> 01:23:52.407
It was all
because of Sudowoodo

01:23:53.756 --> 01:23:55.802
Too early
for celebrating just yet...

01:23:55.802 --> 01:23:57.412
This mess isn't over!

01:24:10.599 --> 01:24:12.123
The fire isn't going out!

01:24:12.819 --> 01:24:14.342
It's okay!

01:24:14.342 --> 01:24:16.605
We'll just keep it contained
until Risa can call Lugia!

01:24:22.002 --> 01:24:23.308
Isn't that...

01:24:26.398 --> 01:24:28.226
Take half
and go around the back!

01:24:28.226 --> 01:24:29.227
It's Father!

01:24:30.358 --> 01:24:31.577
Margo!

01:24:33.144 --> 01:24:34.623
It's Zeraora!

01:24:34.623 --> 01:24:35.755
I'd never seen it...

01:24:37.974 --> 01:24:39.759
It's okay, Zeraora!

01:24:39.759 --> 01:24:42.588
This time, everyone's
here to protect the forest.

01:24:42.588 --> 01:24:44.111
Don't worry!

01:24:51.075 --> 01:24:52.380
All right! Get going!

01:24:53.512 --> 01:24:55.166
Ash...

01:24:55.166 --> 01:24:57.429
You're all right!

01:24:57.429 --> 01:24:59.170
This situation's not good.

01:24:59.170 --> 01:25:00.954
The sprinkler system!

01:25:00.954 --> 01:25:03.478
If it's not broken,
we can get it to work!

01:25:03.478 --> 01:25:05.089
I'll ask the
Electric-type Pokémon

01:25:05.089 --> 01:25:07.047
for assistance!

01:25:07.047 --> 01:25:08.657
Let's
put this fire out!

01:25:08.657 --> 01:25:10.137
Right! We can help, too!

01:25:12.574 --> 01:25:14.924
Zeraora? Listen to me.

01:25:14.924 --> 01:25:18.624
There are bad people...like
those hunters out there...

01:25:18.624 --> 01:25:22.584
...and I admit we all
make bad mistakes sometimes.

01:25:22.584 --> 01:25:25.196
But I want you to
realize that we're not all

01:25:25.196 --> 01:25:27.546
like those bad people.

01:25:27.546 --> 01:25:28.895
Ash said something...

01:25:28.895 --> 01:25:31.419
People can be
pretty weak by themselves.

01:25:31.419 --> 01:25:35.119
But when they team up
with Pokémon, it creates energy!

01:25:37.121 --> 01:25:38.818
I was wondering...

01:25:38.818 --> 01:25:40.863
If it's also true...

01:25:40.863 --> 01:25:43.301
If Pokémon felt
the same way about us...

01:25:43.301 --> 01:25:45.868
Well...I think
that it'd be nice.

01:25:54.138 --> 01:25:56.052
Try it now!

01:25:56.052 --> 01:25:57.445
We're counting on you!

01:26:19.728 --> 01:26:21.382
Okay, work with me!

01:26:29.173 --> 01:26:30.261
All right!

01:26:35.614 --> 01:26:37.181
Hey, Ash!

01:27:15.871 --> 01:27:17.090
Give it your all!

01:27:17.090 --> 01:27:18.134
You can do it!

01:27:18.134 --> 01:27:19.223
You can do it!

01:27:19.223 --> 01:27:20.441
Zeraora!

01:27:21.790 --> 01:27:22.922
Please, Zeraora...

01:27:28.710 --> 01:27:31.452
If Pokémon felt
the same way about us...well...

01:27:31.452 --> 01:27:33.585
I think that it'd be nice.

01:27:42.855 --> 01:27:44.378
Just a little more...

01:27:50.123 --> 01:27:51.429
It's almost there!

01:27:51.429 --> 01:27:52.517
Go on!

01:27:52.517 --> 01:27:53.518
Just a little more!

01:27:53.518 --> 01:27:54.519
You can do it!

01:27:54.519 --> 01:27:55.520
I know you can!

01:27:56.608 --> 01:27:57.783
Zeraora!!

01:28:30.163 --> 01:28:31.251
Zeraora!

01:28:31.251 --> 01:28:32.470
No!!

01:28:38.563 --> 01:28:39.477
Zeraora!

01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:43.568
Zeraora, wake up, please!

01:28:45.526 --> 01:28:46.527
Thank goodness!

01:28:56.624 --> 01:28:57.625
Lugia?

01:29:00.715 --> 01:29:02.674
Lugia, could
you make the rain fall?

01:29:02.674 --> 01:29:04.589
We need to put the fire out!

01:29:04.589 --> 01:29:05.633
Please, will you?

01:29:25.349 --> 01:29:27.351
Lugia.

01:29:27.351 --> 01:29:29.744
Whaddaya know?
I saw the real thing!

01:29:29.744 --> 01:29:32.225
Risa got to the
eternal flame just in time!

01:29:32.225 --> 01:29:33.444
Eternal flame?

01:29:33.444 --> 01:29:35.271
She made
it there so quickly!

01:29:35.271 --> 01:29:38.579
Yeah! She said that
she'd make sure Lugia showed up!

01:29:38.579 --> 01:29:41.321
You've gotta admire
that girl's sheer moxie!

01:29:41.321 --> 01:29:46.065
Once again our city
was saved by Zeraora and Lugia.

01:29:46.065 --> 01:29:47.675
Not quite...

01:29:47.675 --> 01:29:50.112
This time,
everyone saved it!

01:30:27.976 --> 01:30:31.937
Fellow citizens! The only
way we were able to reopen the

01:30:31.937 --> 01:30:34.069
festival for its final day...

01:30:34.069 --> 01:30:36.376
...is through the
complete cooperation of all of

01:30:36.376 --> 01:30:39.205
you, people and Pokémon alike.

01:30:39.205 --> 01:30:42.730
During the day's events,
I'd like to share what I heard.

01:30:42.730 --> 01:30:45.994
A young man said if
one can't do something alone,

01:30:45.994 --> 01:30:48.257
one can with a Pokémon.

01:30:48.257 --> 01:30:50.912
Those citizens and
Pokémon who helped put out the

01:30:50.912 --> 01:30:54.742
fires, along with many others,
proved those words are true.

01:30:54.742 --> 01:30:57.919
My wish is for this city
to be a place to live together!

01:30:57.919 --> 01:31:00.835
And now, our city is that
much closer to that.

01:31:00.835 --> 01:31:04.273
In order to see that
realized, I revoke the lie about

01:31:04.273 --> 01:31:06.711
the disappearance of Zeraora.

01:31:06.711 --> 01:31:10.236
I hereby proclaim that we
will live with Zeraora in peace!

01:31:33.912 --> 01:31:36.871
There are strange
and wonderful forms of life

01:31:36.871 --> 01:31:38.438
inhabiting this planet.

01:31:38.438 --> 01:31:41.310
They can be found
in the skies, in the sea,

01:31:41.310 --> 01:31:43.878
in forests and towns everywhere.

01:31:43.878 --> 01:31:46.098
Indeed,
these creatures can

01:31:46.098 --> 01:31:47.621
be found the world over!

01:31:47.621 --> 01:31:49.754
They work and play with us,

01:31:49.754 --> 01:31:51.930
and we all help each other.

01:31:51.930 --> 01:31:55.977
They live with us and around
us, and even battle with us!

01:31:55.977 --> 01:31:59.503
They form all kinds
of different bonds with us, as

01:31:59.503 --> 01:32:02.636
they live in peace alongside us.

01:32:02.636 --> 01:32:05.987
Each living
being has its own dream.

01:32:05.987 --> 01:32:08.990
And there are as many
adventures to be experienced as

01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:10.601
there are living beings!

01:32:10.601 --> 01:32:14.648
And the name of all
these incredible creatures?

01:32:14.648 --> 01:32:20.654
We call them...Pokémon!

01:36:57.513 --> 01:36:59.124
And so...

01:36:59.124 --> 01:37:00.865
Fula City
created a nature preserve!

01:37:04.346 --> 01:37:06.174
Risa?!

01:37:06.174 --> 01:37:09.743
Tell me! How in the world
did you know where I was?

01:37:09.743 --> 01:37:11.876
And it had
better be the truth...

01:37:11.876 --> 01:37:14.792
It's really kind of
high-tech...

01:37:14.792 --> 01:37:17.490
I wanted pictures
of the Wind Festival...

01:37:17.490 --> 01:37:18.665
So I uh...

01:37:22.277 --> 01:37:23.278
Pikachu?

01:37:24.171 --> 01:37:26.194
I wonder what kind of
Pokémon we'll meet next?
