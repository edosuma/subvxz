WEBVTT

00:05.927 --> 00:08.636
It can't wait till morning?

00:08.637 --> 00:10.346
Got to grab the deposit.

00:10.347 --> 00:12.216
Won't be long, honey.

00:12.217 --> 00:13.676
Charles.

00:13.677 --> 00:15.346
Don't be longer.

00:15.347 --> 00:17.676
I got a surprise for you
when we get home tonight.

00:17.677 --> 00:18.846
Ooh...

00:18.847 --> 00:20.216
Yeah.

00:37.257 --> 00:39.096
My God!

00:39.097 --> 00:40.926
Charles!

00:40.927 --> 00:42.256
Authorities have determined

00:42.257 --> 00:43.466
that the fire that destroyed.

00:43.467 --> 00:45.466
Keller's Diner was in fact arson...

00:45.467 --> 00:47.596
The wildfire burned almost 31 acres

00:47.597 --> 00:49.886
and destroyed 13 homes around
the town of Kavanaugh...

00:49.887 --> 00:51.556
Local resident Peter Walsh

00:51.557 --> 00:53.466
has been arrested for the alleged arson

00:53.467 --> 00:56.006
and murder of his former boss,
Charles Keller,

00:56.007 --> 00:57.466
owner of Keller's Diner.

00:57.467 --> 01:00.216
American Ninja competition?

01:00.217 --> 01:03.096
No. Weekend warriors
getaway with some friends

01:03.097 --> 01:04.012
from the Bureau.

01:04.013 --> 01:04.926
Sounds...

01:04.927 --> 01:06.032
excruciating.

01:06.033 --> 01:06.864
Let's hope so.

01:06.889 --> 01:09.006
When's the last time we
all had a weekend off?

01:09.007 --> 01:10.811
You still going to that hacker meet-up...

01:10.836 --> 01:12.256
That was supposed to be a secret.

01:12.257 --> 01:15.256
All right, ladies,
last check before I jet off

01:15.257 --> 01:16.427
to Augusta, G-A.

01:16.428 --> 01:17.596
Whoa.

01:17.597 --> 01:19.685
Are you playing in the Masters?

01:19.710 --> 01:21.283
Final check-in. Chunk?

01:21.308 --> 01:23.346
Seven witnesses prepped and
ready for the Guzman deposition.

01:23.347 --> 01:25.056
Psych files on the Rocketman IV

01:25.057 --> 01:26.216
and Sugar suits in your inbox.

01:26.217 --> 01:28.216
A very productive Saturday morning.

01:28.217 --> 01:30.197
I hope you all enjoy your weekend

01:30.222 --> 01:31.346
while the boss is away.

01:31.347 --> 01:32.926
I will be at the spa spending time

01:32.927 --> 01:34.426
with my masseuse Serge.

01:34.427 --> 01:35.636
Hey, wait, did Benny and Bull

01:35.637 --> 01:37.466
really go to New Hampshire to go fishing?

01:37.467 --> 01:39.386
Yeah, I didn't
even know Bull had a cabin.

01:39.387 --> 01:41.796
There is no record of it anywhere.

01:41.797 --> 01:43.596
If someone were to check.

01:45.015 --> 01:46.231
Bull has a cabin?

01:46.256 --> 01:48.046
Correction... Bull had a cabin.

01:52.137 --> 01:54.386
How old were you when you came up here?

01:55.847 --> 01:57.846
Every summer, ages ten to 14.

01:59.097 --> 02:00.506
It's where I learned to...

02:00.507 --> 02:03.477
fish, hike...

02:03.502 --> 02:06.252
go for long walks with Abigail Barnes.

02:06.277 --> 02:09.056
It's your dad's cabin...
Do you want to take a moment?

02:09.056 --> 02:11.256
No. I'm good.

02:11.257 --> 02:13.926
Seriously? That's it?

02:13.927 --> 02:17.216
You cannot lose the thing
you do not cling to.

02:17.217 --> 02:18.886
Buddha said that.

02:18.887 --> 02:21.136
Maybe it was Taylor Swift.

02:21.137 --> 02:23.506
If you didn't care about it,
why'd you buy it?

02:23.507 --> 02:25.926
Dad was strapped for cash.

02:25.927 --> 02:28.057
I overpaid, of course.

02:28.660 --> 02:30.489
You never talk about him.

02:30.514 --> 02:32.167
That's because there are seven billion

02:32.192 --> 02:34.151
more interesting subjects on the planet.

02:34.176 --> 02:35.306
Here comes one.

02:35.307 --> 02:37.306
Hi there! Saw your car.

02:37.307 --> 02:38.726
Joyce Magruder.

02:38.727 --> 02:40.097
At Mossy Green Realty.

02:40.100 --> 02:41.596
Jason Bull. Hi.

02:41.597 --> 02:43.266
Benny ColÃ³n.

02:43.267 --> 02:46.436
Jason Bull. Wow. Yes.

02:46.437 --> 02:48.306
I would remember

02:48.307 --> 02:49.396
that smile anywhere.

02:49.397 --> 02:51.226
I-I used to be Joyce Devlin.

02:51.227 --> 02:53.896
You probably wouldn't remember me.

02:53.897 --> 02:56.186
Of course I do, Joyce.

02:56.187 --> 02:58.226
You had that pink bike with all those...

02:58.227 --> 03:00.016
streamers on the handlebars.

03:00.017 --> 03:01.146
That's me.

03:01.147 --> 03:02.976
Shame about your dad's cabin.

03:02.977 --> 03:03.812
Such a tragedy.

03:03.813 --> 03:05.066
He's coping well.

03:05.091 --> 03:07.131
The insurance check helps.

03:07.727 --> 03:09.807
You always come out on top, don't you?

03:12.227 --> 03:14.356
Speaking of which, how's your father?

03:14.357 --> 03:16.146
I wouldn't know.

03:16.147 --> 03:18.436
Well, at least they caught this guy.

03:18.437 --> 03:20.516
Peter Walsh.

03:20.517 --> 03:22.306
You remember the Walshes.

03:23.597 --> 03:25.686
Well, Jason...

03:25.687 --> 03:28.686
if you're looking to sell your land or,
you know, maybe even

03:28.687 --> 03:30.726
buy something new...

03:30.727 --> 03:32.477
give me a shout.

03:35.227 --> 03:36.806
Nice to meet you.

03:36.807 --> 03:38.096
Yeah.

03:38.097 --> 03:40.096
Hey...

03:40.097 --> 03:42.016
what's up with your father?

03:42.017 --> 03:44.856
Well, let's just say...

03:44.857 --> 03:47.437
he didn't leave town with many friends.

03:55.267 --> 03:59.306
Ha! You get your
fishing license at a bar.

03:59.307 --> 04:01.186
How cool is that?

04:01.187 --> 04:03.226
You know, in Puerto Rico,
I used to fly fish

04:03.227 --> 04:05.556
on the flats for bonefish.

04:07.357 --> 04:08.896
Here it's all about the trout.

04:08.897 --> 04:11.306
Well, look who's here.

04:11.307 --> 04:13.147
Jason Bull.

04:14.437 --> 04:15.806
Walt Simonds.

04:15.807 --> 04:16.807
That's Chief Simonds.

04:16.808 --> 04:17.805
Okay.

04:17.807 --> 04:19.356
Well, I'm attorney Benny Coln.

04:19.357 --> 04:21.356
Colleague of.

04:21.357 --> 04:22.647
Dr. Jason Bull.

04:22.648 --> 04:23.936
Dr. Bull?

04:23.937 --> 04:27.767
Well, your father must
be very proud of you.

04:28.807 --> 04:30.476
He must be.

04:30.477 --> 04:33.227
Sorry about your cabin.

04:34.124 --> 04:35.766
Paper said you caught the arsonist.

04:35.767 --> 04:37.357
He's an arsonist and a murderer.

04:37.381 --> 04:39.878
Trial looks like a slam dunk.

04:39.903 --> 04:41.646
- How so?
- Well, Peter Walsh

04:41.647 --> 04:42.794
was the dishwasher

04:42.819 --> 04:46.056
at the diner, got laid off
two days before the fire.

04:46.057 --> 04:47.476
He wanted revenge.

04:47.477 --> 04:50.056
Then there's the can of lighter fluid

04:50.057 --> 04:51.856
with his prints all over it.

04:51.857 --> 04:53.936
And let's don't forget

04:53.937 --> 04:55.807
who his family is.

04:58.307 --> 04:59.806
That's right.

04:59.807 --> 05:01.356
He's a Walsh.

05:01.357 --> 05:03.266
Just like I'm a Bull.

05:03.267 --> 05:04.856
You got that right.

05:04.857 --> 05:07.146
See you around, Doctor.

05:07.147 --> 05:08.856
Three beers, please!

05:08.857 --> 05:10.267
You got it, Chief!

05:15.307 --> 05:17.596
We're not going fishing, are we?

05:17.597 --> 05:20.357
Not for fish.

05:27.477 --> 05:30.356
Feels like a bad idea, Bull.

05:30.357 --> 05:32.896
I love how no one locks
their doors up here.

05:32.897 --> 05:34.396
Listen, the kid's in jail...

05:34.397 --> 05:36.516
I'm sure he won't mind
us having a look around.

05:36.517 --> 05:38.856
No, I was actually referring
to you picking a fight

05:38.857 --> 05:40.266
with the chief.

05:40.267 --> 05:43.396
Diner bursts into
flames killing the owner,

05:43.397 --> 05:45.476
and the first guy they
blame is from a family

05:45.477 --> 05:47.306
the town's hated for years?

05:47.307 --> 05:50.806
Little too easy, if you ask me.

05:50.807 --> 05:53.975
Wow. This is some cool stuff.

05:57.097 --> 05:59.436
What's he doing living
out here in the woods?

05:59.437 --> 06:02.186
Well, the Walshes were
the town ne'er-do-wells.

06:02.187 --> 06:04.476
Father split, the mother died,

06:04.477 --> 06:07.471
the older brother was
always getting in trouble.

06:07.496 --> 06:11.516
Young male loner,
comes from a troubled family history.

06:11.517 --> 06:13.096
Fits the arsonist profile.

06:13.097 --> 06:14.516
As does substance abuse,

06:14.517 --> 06:17.936
but I don't see any signs
of drugs or alcohol. Do you?

06:17.937 --> 06:19.686
Nope.

06:19.687 --> 06:21.936
Just this jaywalking citation.

06:23.477 --> 06:25.726
Yeah, I got my fair share of these.

06:25.727 --> 06:28.516
In Kavanaugh, this is how they...

06:28.517 --> 06:30.306
give you a little warning.

06:30.307 --> 06:32.976
I take it you want to meet him?

06:32.977 --> 06:34.186
Don't you?

06:38.307 --> 06:40.356
But you're not a lawyer?

06:40.357 --> 06:41.686
I don't need to be.

06:41.687 --> 06:44.016
I just try to understand people.

06:44.017 --> 06:46.556
That's what my company does...
Trial analysis.

06:46.557 --> 06:48.646
It's about understanding...

06:48.647 --> 06:52.476
why, for instance,
people think you started this fire.

06:52.477 --> 06:53.766
And then...

06:53.767 --> 06:56.448
we need to get them to realize...
you didn't.

06:56.473 --> 06:58.016
Assuming you didn't.

06:58.017 --> 06:59.976
I'm a lawyer.

07:01.397 --> 07:03.356
Okay.

07:03.357 --> 07:06.266
So we've been talking for a few minutes.

07:06.267 --> 07:08.726
What do you understand about me?

07:08.727 --> 07:11.856
Well, so far... You're
inventive, smart...

07:11.857 --> 07:13.950
but you don't like to share,

07:13.975 --> 07:15.934
because people tend to take you

07:15.959 --> 07:17.596
the wrong way.

07:17.597 --> 07:19.936
And you have been an outcast so long,

07:19.937 --> 07:22.856
you don't trust an invitation...

07:22.857 --> 07:24.766
to join anything.

07:24.767 --> 07:27.187
Even a simple conversation.

07:36.807 --> 07:38.556
Did you start the fire?

07:38.557 --> 07:40.936
Hell, no.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.814
I just always get blamed for
what happens around here.

07:43.839 --> 07:45.306
You don't have an alibi.

07:45.331 --> 07:47.947
When I'm not at work, I'm at home

07:47.972 --> 07:49.992
playing guitar, or making one.

07:50.017 --> 07:51.476
By yourself?

07:51.477 --> 07:54.028
They found a lighter fluid
can with your prints on it.

07:54.053 --> 07:56.556
You'd just been fired, you can
understand how that looks.

07:56.557 --> 07:58.778
Yeah, but it's not like that.

07:58.803 --> 08:00.356
I mean, yeah, I was bummed.

08:00.357 --> 08:01.436
It was good gig, but...

08:01.437 --> 08:03.226
I would never...

08:03.227 --> 08:05.226
But what about you? What's your deal?

08:05.227 --> 08:06.522
What are you doing up here?

08:06.547 --> 08:07.936
My cabin burned down.

08:07.937 --> 08:09.476
I haven't been up here in a while.

08:09.477 --> 08:10.667
But I knew your brother Jake.

08:10.668 --> 08:11.671
Yeah?

08:11.696 --> 08:13.557
Look, if you guys are doing this

08:13.560 --> 08:15.556
out of some sort of favor to my brother,

08:15.557 --> 08:17.226
you should know that I think he is

08:17.227 --> 08:19.016
a lying scumbag.

08:19.017 --> 08:21.016
I can see you're nothing like him.

08:21.017 --> 08:23.396
Which is why I want to help you.

08:23.397 --> 08:26.212
Okay, Benny...

08:26.237 --> 08:27.658
Voir dire starts in two days.

08:27.683 --> 08:30.486
Peter... this is your new attorney.

08:31.557 --> 08:33.017
Dr. Bull...

08:34.937 --> 08:36.476
thanks.

08:36.477 --> 08:38.015
Don't mention it.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.344
I think we both have something
to prove to this town.

08:53.094 --> 08:54.673
So much for the weekend off.

08:54.674 --> 08:56.093
He wouldn't have called us

08:56.094 --> 08:57.384
if he didn't really need us.

08:57.385 --> 08:58.673
All right...

08:58.674 --> 09:00.053
we're here.

09:00.054 --> 09:01.179
Ooh.

09:02.304 --> 09:05.839
Wow. Norman Rockwell called.

09:05.864 --> 09:07.303
He wants his painting back.

09:07.304 --> 09:08.303
Kavanaugh, New Hampshire.

09:08.304 --> 09:10.303
4,000.

09:10.304 --> 09:12.973
Clean air, clean water,

09:12.974 --> 09:15.053
overpriced maple syrup
and strong-willed people.

09:15.054 --> 09:17.013
So, what, you had a cabin

09:17.014 --> 09:19.433
up here and never
used it once in 25 years?

09:19.434 --> 09:21.723
It's a funny story...
Maybe I'll tell you sometime.

09:21.724 --> 09:24.513
The techs have finished setting up.

09:24.514 --> 09:27.133
Let's go. We got a lot of work to do.

09:27.134 --> 09:29.093
Okay, Peter Walsh.

09:29.094 --> 09:31.013
He's been arrested five times

09:31.014 --> 09:33.553
by the sheriff... all
eventually dismissed.

09:33.554 --> 09:36.723
Peter's reputation was
decided a long time ago

09:36.724 --> 09:39.093
by his father and his brother... And now

09:39.094 --> 09:40.553
whenever there's trouble in town,

09:40.554 --> 09:42.593
the sheriff knocks on Peter's door first.

09:42.594 --> 09:45.433
We got to convince this town
that Peter's his own man,

09:45.434 --> 09:47.673
and nothing like his family.

09:47.698 --> 09:49.599
- That's not gonna be easy.
- Well, if it was easy,

09:49.623 --> 09:51.553
It wouldn't be fun, Chunk.

09:51.554 --> 09:54.723
Cable, I think it's time
we did a deep dive

09:54.724 --> 09:56.303
on the white hot social scene

09:56.304 --> 09:58.013
of Kavanaugh... Let's find out

09:58.014 --> 09:59.593
who the movers and shakers are,

09:59.594 --> 10:02.303
and who might hold sway over the
jury outside of the courtroom.

10:02.304 --> 10:04.593
So he's been charged
with second degree murder

10:04.594 --> 10:07.343
and arson, okay,
but arson has to be our focus.

10:07.344 --> 10:09.786
If they can't prove arson,
then the murder goes away.

10:13.264 --> 10:14.933
Go down and grab some lunch.

10:19.844 --> 10:21.133
Thanks.

10:22.514 --> 10:24.803
Hi, Peter. I'm Chunk.

10:26.174 --> 10:29.014
Dr. Bull asked me to
prepare you for trial.

10:30.054 --> 10:31.593
Yo.

10:31.594 --> 10:34.133
He, mentioned that you play guitar?

10:34.134 --> 10:36.723
I styled some bands for
magazine photo shoots.

10:36.724 --> 10:38.763
You kind of remind me of them.

10:38.764 --> 10:39.909
Yeah? Like who?

10:39.910 --> 10:41.053
Jack White.

10:41.054 --> 10:43.485
Black Keys, a few others.

10:45.804 --> 10:48.803
You seem distracted.

10:48.804 --> 10:50.133
It-It's my music.

10:50.134 --> 10:52.173
It fills my head.

10:52.174 --> 10:56.093
Well, there's a time for music,
and a time for focus.

10:56.094 --> 10:57.973
Is this gonna be a lecture?

10:57.974 --> 10:59.223
It's a life line.

10:59.224 --> 11:01.223
You gonna take it?

11:03.304 --> 11:05.303
Okay, here's our jury pool.

11:05.304 --> 11:08.383
Patricia Morrison,
head of the events committee,

11:08.384 --> 11:11.133
Tracy Chubricks, who
owns the flower shop,

11:11.134 --> 11:13.723
and Betsy Hanson,
runs the knitting studio.

11:13.724 --> 11:16.473
And Edward Klein is the
high school math teacher.

11:16.474 --> 11:18.383
And all roads lead to...

11:18.384 --> 11:20.673
Joyce Magruder.

11:20.674 --> 11:22.513
40, real estate agent.

11:22.514 --> 11:24.133
Married, no children.

11:24.134 --> 11:26.223
Cares deeply about
Kavanaugh's reputation.

11:26.224 --> 11:28.633
Yeah. Benny and
I already ran into her.

11:28.634 --> 11:31.303
She... she's our sneezer.

11:31.304 --> 11:32.739
I don't get it.

11:32.740 --> 11:34.173
Our influencer.

11:34.174 --> 11:35.553
When she opens her mouth,

11:35.554 --> 11:38.473
her words spread like
an unchecked sneeze.

11:38.474 --> 11:39.803
Gesundheit.

11:48.844 --> 11:50.343
Nice job, Chunk.

11:50.344 --> 11:51.803
Well, God gave him talent.

11:51.804 --> 11:53.763
This poor kid needs
all the help he can get.

11:53.764 --> 11:55.883
Well, now he gets us.

11:55.884 --> 11:57.513
There you go, Peter.

11:57.514 --> 11:59.933
Looking good. Thanks.

11:59.934 --> 12:01.224
You were gonna find something?

12:01.225 --> 12:02.513
Yeah, you know it.

12:02.514 --> 12:04.173
I see all my friends showed up.

12:05.514 --> 12:07.303
Enough chatter in the gallery.

12:07.304 --> 12:09.383
I expect good behavior in my courtroom.

12:09.384 --> 12:12.133
Peter, you've got a
reputation you don't deserve.

12:12.134 --> 12:14.173
We're gonna find you a
jury that'll give you

12:14.174 --> 12:15.433
that reputation a second look.

12:15.434 --> 12:17.763
Mr. ColÃ³n, you may

12:17.764 --> 12:20.093
begin your voir dire.

12:20.094 --> 12:23.053
You have a beautiful town

12:23.054 --> 12:24.433
here, folks. Wow!

12:24.434 --> 12:27.553
It's not hard to see
why Kavanaugh is known

12:27.554 --> 12:30.673
as one of New Hampshire's
best towns to live in.

12:30.674 --> 12:33.383
Of course, with the recent wildfire might

12:33.384 --> 12:35.053
cause some to rethink that.

12:35.054 --> 12:37.263
What do you like most about this town?

12:37.264 --> 12:38.933
The sense of community.

12:38.934 --> 12:39.974
She belongs

12:39.977 --> 12:42.093
to just about every club there is.

12:42.094 --> 12:45.053
A lot of overlap with Joyce.

12:45.054 --> 12:47.673
But she took off work last week
because her son was getting

12:47.674 --> 12:49.304
bullied at school.

12:50.899 --> 12:53.359
Acceptable to the defense, Your Honor.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.883
Do you know the defendant, sir?

12:55.884 --> 12:57.652
I hired him to clean out my garage.

12:59.514 --> 13:01.263
Strike for cause, Your Honor.

13:01.264 --> 13:02.433
Approach.

13:02.434 --> 13:05.093
This guy hired Peter for jobs.

13:05.094 --> 13:06.223
He's not sympathetic?

13:06.224 --> 13:08.803
No. Look at his body language.

13:08.804 --> 13:10.673
Hostile, arms crossed.

13:10.674 --> 13:12.223
He gave Peter a chance.

13:12.224 --> 13:14.383
Now he feels betrayed, like somebody

13:14.384 --> 13:16.883
who picks up a stray dog
only to have his hand bitten.

13:16.884 --> 13:19.804
Mr. Jenkins, you are excused.

13:23.884 --> 13:25.384
I know you stole my chainsaw.

13:28.974 --> 13:33.093
Ms. Magruder is acceptable
to the prosecution.

13:33.094 --> 13:34.553
Our sneezer.

13:34.554 --> 13:36.634
We strike her.

13:42.014 --> 13:43.304
Strike, Your Honor.

13:44.474 --> 13:46.843
Ms. Magruder, you are excused.

13:46.844 --> 13:48.843
Kavanaugh's a small town.

13:48.844 --> 13:51.053
Too small to find a mirror jury

13:51.054 --> 13:55.263
that's gonna accurately
reflect the real jury.

13:55.264 --> 13:56.593
So we use Joyce.

13:56.594 --> 13:58.473
She knows what everyone's thinking.

13:58.474 --> 14:01.433
She will function as our mirror jury.

14:01.434 --> 14:04.383
You and Joyce are about
to become quite close.

14:04.384 --> 14:05.764
Um...

14:07.203 --> 14:08.723
The court is in recess until

14:08.724 --> 14:09.724
9:30 tomorrow.

14:10.724 --> 14:13.383
Okay.

14:13.384 --> 14:14.383
Hey.

14:14.384 --> 14:16.473
So Chief Simonds is being,

14:16.474 --> 14:18.593
shall we say, uncooperative?

14:18.594 --> 14:20.263
He's stonewalling us on the fire files.

14:20.264 --> 14:22.304
Man really holds a grudge.

14:22.307 --> 14:25.224
- Shall I, get them a different way?
- No.

14:25.227 --> 14:27.434
This one's on me.

14:28.474 --> 14:29.433
Okay.

14:29.434 --> 14:31.933
Hey, Chief.

14:31.934 --> 14:33.843
Wanted to talk to you

14:33.844 --> 14:36.013
about getting access
to some of those files.

14:36.014 --> 14:38.133
Your assistant already asked.

14:38.134 --> 14:39.633
I already answered.

14:39.634 --> 14:41.159
You mean Danny.

14:41.184 --> 14:42.803
Um, yeah, I know.

14:42.804 --> 14:45.473
But I thought I'd ask again,
maybe a little more nicely.

14:45.474 --> 14:47.263
Pretty please, sugar on top?

14:47.264 --> 14:48.723
Sorry, no.

14:48.724 --> 14:50.473
Well, at least I tried.

14:53.554 --> 14:55.433
Is there something else?

14:55.434 --> 14:57.053
No, I'm just gonna head back to court,

14:57.054 --> 14:58.383
get a subpoena for those files.

14:58.384 --> 15:00.383
Yeah, I wasn't really asking a favor.

15:00.384 --> 15:02.311
My client has a legal
right to that information.

15:02.336 --> 15:05.553
We both know that, which makes me
wonder why you'd be denying it.

15:05.554 --> 15:07.723
I mean, are you just
being prickly and difficult,

15:07.724 --> 15:09.724
or are you hiding something?

15:14.171 --> 15:17.881
You think you can hustle me,
just like your father?

15:19.301 --> 15:21.301
It's your move, Chief.

15:23.011 --> 15:25.460
Your assistant can pick
up the files in my office.

15:25.461 --> 15:27.260
Well, I wouldn't call her my assistant.

15:27.261 --> 15:29.130
She's former FBI, Danielle James.

15:29.131 --> 15:31.841
I call her "Danny."

15:33.051 --> 15:34.420
See the floor?

15:34.421 --> 15:36.170
The fire chief stated in his report

15:36.171 --> 15:38.617
that these are pour patterns
from the lighter fluid.

15:38.642 --> 15:40.260
No.

15:40.261 --> 15:41.800
The lab didn't find any chemical trace

15:41.801 --> 15:43.220
of an accelerant or lighter fluid.

15:43.221 --> 15:46.380
These patterns are a heat
effect from the flashover.

15:46.381 --> 15:48.590
Okay. Prosecution's saying

15:48.591 --> 15:50.670
Peter poured lighter fluid on the floor,

15:50.671 --> 15:52.171
and that's not the case.

15:52.174 --> 15:54.260
Here's what I think's going on.

15:54.261 --> 15:55.785
There was

15:55.810 --> 15:58.832
a house fire about four
months ago off Route 25,

15:58.857 --> 16:01.010
and then last year,
a blaze took out a boathouse

16:01.011 --> 16:02.854
- on the south shore of the lake.
- Okay.

16:02.879 --> 16:05.460
But the chief ruled these
two fires to be accidents.

16:05.461 --> 16:07.960
But the more you know about how
these fires spread, the more

16:07.961 --> 16:10.050
similar they look to the diner fire.

16:10.051 --> 16:13.340
The diner fire was caused by propane gas.

16:13.341 --> 16:15.050
With a time-delayed ignition.

16:15.051 --> 16:17.300
And the other two fires were caused
by, um, space heaters.

16:17.301 --> 16:18.670
Same delay.

16:18.671 --> 16:20.760
Which gives the arsonist time to escape.

16:20.761 --> 16:24.170
Benny needs to see this.

16:24.171 --> 16:26.670
We need to bring up these fires
when the chief is on the stand.

16:26.671 --> 16:29.010
He went fishing with Chunk.

16:29.011 --> 16:31.220
Needed a moment of Zen before court.

16:31.221 --> 16:33.220
One bar.

16:33.221 --> 16:35.050
Two bars.

16:35.051 --> 16:37.300
No bars. Damn it!

16:37.301 --> 16:39.301
- The car's right over that hill.
- We're lost.

16:39.302 --> 16:40.300
We can't be.

16:40.301 --> 16:43.340
- I'm due in court in an hour!
- Damn!

16:43.341 --> 16:45.460
We didn't even catch a fish.

16:45.461 --> 16:48.340
Wait. The judge will
grant us a continuance.

16:48.341 --> 16:52.420
They can't put Peter on trial
without his lawyer, right?

16:52.421 --> 16:53.421
Right?

17:02.428 --> 17:05.002
Guess who's got a new bestie.

17:05.003 --> 17:07.542
Ð¡ongratulations,
new Miss New Hampshire.

17:07.544 --> 17:11.133
Seems she wants to pick my brain
as much as we want to pick hers.

17:11.134 --> 17:13.463
We have

17:13.464 --> 17:15.633
a date to, shoot skeet.

17:15.634 --> 17:18.173
Well, the skeet of New
Hampshire should be very afraid.

17:18.174 --> 17:19.423
Have you heard from Benny?

17:19.424 --> 17:20.803
I thought he was here.

17:20.804 --> 17:22.502
No. Benny's phone's going
straight to voice mail,

17:22.503 --> 17:24.002
and I can't reach Chunk, either.

17:24.003 --> 17:25.303
What do you want to do?

17:25.304 --> 17:26.843
Well, I could pull the fire alarm.

17:26.844 --> 17:29.009
Time's up, Dr. Bull.

17:29.034 --> 17:30.322
Where is Mr. ColÃ³n?

17:30.347 --> 17:33.043
Um... Your Honor,

17:33.044 --> 17:35.133
I wonder if, at this time,

17:35.134 --> 17:38.843
we might ask for one more continuance?

17:38.844 --> 17:40.883
Not a chance. That's not the way

17:40.884 --> 17:42.093
we work up here.

17:42.094 --> 17:44.843
We set a time, and we stick by it.

17:44.844 --> 17:46.671
Then I'll be filling in.

17:47.677 --> 17:51.016
Your Honor, Dr. Bull is not an attorney.

17:51.017 --> 17:52.756
Rule number 20.

17:52.757 --> 17:54.756
New Hampshire law.

17:54.757 --> 17:56.216
Mr. Walsh can assign

17:56.217 --> 17:58.596
temporary Power of Attorney to me,

17:58.597 --> 17:59.426
and I will

17:59.427 --> 18:01.136
represent him in court until

18:01.137 --> 18:05.216
such time as Mr. ColÃ³n is
available to join us again.

18:05.217 --> 18:08.426
Mr. Walsh, you'd like to have Dr. Bull

18:08.427 --> 18:11.216
act as your lawyer
until Mr. ColÃ³n arrives?

18:11.217 --> 18:14.217
Sure... Your Honor.

18:16.097 --> 18:18.256
As my report states,

18:18.257 --> 18:21.136
Mr. Walsh had recently
been fired from his job.

18:21.137 --> 18:23.056
There were no signs of
a break-in, meaning

18:23.057 --> 18:25.426
the arsonist used a key
to enter and exit.

18:25.427 --> 18:28.216
We also found an empty
container of lighter fluid

18:28.217 --> 18:30.136
in the Dumpster out back.

18:30.137 --> 18:33.306
Mr. Walsh's fingerprints
were found on the container.

18:33.307 --> 18:37.096
Based on a career of arson investigation,

18:37.097 --> 18:38.676
this is a clear-cut case.

18:38.677 --> 18:39.641
No further questions.

18:39.666 --> 18:40.985
Thank you, Mr. Pigden.

18:41.010 --> 18:42.355
Dr. Bull, you're up.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.096
It's interesting.

18:46.097 --> 18:47.846
So isn't it true that,

18:47.847 --> 18:48.938
the diner had

18:48.963 --> 18:52.136
an incinerator out back that
was used to burn trash, and

18:52.137 --> 18:54.426
they often used lighter fluid
to get those fires started?

18:54.427 --> 18:56.426
Lighter fluid was on hand.

18:56.427 --> 18:58.256
It's easy to see why Mr. Walsh

18:58.257 --> 18:59.967
used it to set the fire.

18:59.968 --> 19:01.676
Yeah.

19:01.677 --> 19:03.826
Just reading this report,

19:03.851 --> 19:05.516
and, you know, the chemical tests...

19:05.517 --> 19:07.136
They came back negative

19:07.137 --> 19:09.426
for the presence of
any accelerants or other

19:09.427 --> 19:12.216
flammable material that would
have been found in the diner.

19:12.217 --> 19:15.846
Sometimes a fire burns so hot,
no chemical residue remains.

19:15.847 --> 19:17.136
So help me out here.

19:17.137 --> 19:19.966
Why would the arsonist
throw this container

19:19.967 --> 19:24.104
into a Dumpster instead of the fire?

19:24.129 --> 19:26.216
Probably left in a hurry,
didn't want to be caught

19:26.217 --> 19:27.886
with evidence on him.

19:27.887 --> 19:29.256
Probably.

19:29.257 --> 19:31.676
It's not a word I like to use in court.

19:31.677 --> 19:34.176
But anyway, um,

19:34.177 --> 19:36.346
would it be possible for

19:36.347 --> 19:38.716
the arsonist to uncouple
the propane line,

19:38.717 --> 19:41.176
and then, say, leave these fryers on

19:41.177 --> 19:44.466
so that, an hour later, kaboom?

19:44.467 --> 19:46.136
It's possible.

19:46.137 --> 19:49.056
And wouldn't a fire
that hot spread without

19:49.057 --> 19:51.176
the aid of an accelerant,
like lighter fluid?

19:51.177 --> 19:53.516
My 40 plus years of experience

19:53.517 --> 19:56.096
tells me that he used an accelerant,

19:56.097 --> 19:57.946
and the lighter fluid was there.

19:57.971 --> 20:00.806
But you agree that
the theory is possible?

20:00.807 --> 20:03.346
You're just like your old man.

20:03.347 --> 20:05.256
Always trying

20:05.257 --> 20:07.216
to sell a story.

20:07.217 --> 20:09.426
You see how he didn't want
to answer the question?

20:09.427 --> 20:11.096
Deflection.

20:11.097 --> 20:14.216
Interesting. So try and answer
the question for me, Chief.

20:14.217 --> 20:16.096
Because this lighter fluid is

20:16.097 --> 20:18.426
the only piece of evidence that you have

20:18.427 --> 20:21.109
that ties Peter Walsh to this fire.

20:21.134 --> 20:22.132
Now you're trying

20:22.157 --> 20:24.556
to hustle these good people
into believing that that punk

20:24.557 --> 20:29.306
didn't kill a man and
burn down half this town.

20:29.307 --> 20:31.347
Not on my watch, son.

20:32.847 --> 20:37.306
Half the town's already burned
down on your watch, Chief.

20:37.307 --> 20:38.387
You watch it, Bull.

20:39.427 --> 20:41.636
Remember this fire?

20:41.637 --> 20:44.030
Four months ago, Route 25.

20:44.055 --> 20:45.886
Objection. Irrelevant.

20:45.887 --> 20:48.256
Because you haven't let me
say why it's relevant yet.

20:48.257 --> 20:50.162
Show us soon, Dr. Bull.

20:50.163 --> 20:51.016
Thank you,

20:51.041 --> 20:52.958
Your Honor. You remember this fire, Chief?

20:52.983 --> 20:54.386
Yes.

20:54.387 --> 20:56.307
- And you ruled it an accident.
- It was an accident.

20:56.310 --> 20:57.632
That's interesting.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.466
So, Oliver Brant's boathouse a year ago,

20:59.467 --> 21:02.995
you also ruled that an accident. And yet

21:03.020 --> 21:04.729
those two fires

21:04.730 --> 21:06.099
had the same M.O.

21:06.100 --> 21:07.599
as this diner fire.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.349
Except those were accidents

21:09.350 --> 21:11.099
and this was arson.

21:11.100 --> 21:12.599
I mean, that's just the last year.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.769
Which got me thinking, I mean,
what if we went back in time?

21:14.770 --> 21:16.559
How many more mistakes will we find?

21:16.560 --> 21:17.582
You son of a bitch.

21:17.607 --> 21:18.739
That's not an answer, Chief.

21:18.764 --> 21:20.028
Objection. Your Honor!

21:20.053 --> 21:21.053
Dr. Bull.

21:22.020 --> 21:23.230
No further questions.

21:26.639 --> 21:28.139
What the hell was that?

21:28.140 --> 21:30.139
Chief? He got a little riled up,

21:30.140 --> 21:31.639
didn't he? That's good for us.

21:31.640 --> 21:33.969
So that's why you're
doing this, isn't it?

21:33.970 --> 21:36.469
You want to get some sort
of revenge on this place?

21:36.470 --> 21:38.519
It's not revenge. It's...

21:38.520 --> 21:40.139
clarity.

21:40.140 --> 21:41.809
I think we both need that.

21:41.810 --> 21:43.429
You don't know what I need.

21:43.430 --> 21:45.849
You don't know me.
You don't know who I am.

21:45.850 --> 21:47.271
I know you.

21:47.296 --> 21:50.639
Or at least I understand
what you've been through.

21:50.640 --> 21:53.559
You know, my dad brought
us up here in the early '90s.

21:53.560 --> 21:56.389
There was a recession going on.

21:56.390 --> 21:58.559
But my dad had a big smile.

21:58.560 --> 22:00.559
He made fast friends.

22:00.560 --> 22:03.729
And then he got everyone
very excited about

22:03.730 --> 22:07.139
this big new development
coming to Kavanaugh.

22:07.140 --> 22:10.218
And he sold 'em a dream.

22:10.243 --> 22:12.389
Everybody thought they
were gonna get rich.

22:12.390 --> 22:15.390
My dad got his big finder's fee.

22:15.415 --> 22:17.906
But he lied to pretty much
everyone else in the process.

22:17.907 --> 22:21.986
And when the development
pulled out of Kavanaugh,

22:21.987 --> 22:25.366
an army of lawyers descended on the town,

22:25.367 --> 22:27.406
extracting millions in penalties.

22:27.407 --> 22:29.406
I was hated.

22:29.407 --> 22:31.616
Instant outcast.

22:31.617 --> 22:35.116
One night, my dad packed us up,

22:35.117 --> 22:37.406
and we just snuck out of town.

22:37.407 --> 22:39.817
Never said good-bye to anyone.

22:41.867 --> 22:44.616
My dad.

22:44.617 --> 22:47.237
He could sell ice to Eskimos.

22:49.237 --> 22:51.616
It's probably best you left.

22:51.617 --> 22:53.446
My mom stuck around, and I've been blamed

22:53.447 --> 22:56.446
for my family's actions my whole life.

22:56.447 --> 22:59.156
Well,

22:59.157 --> 23:01.276
we are gonna change some minds about you.

23:03.575 --> 23:05.657
- Hold on, guys. You can't come in here.
- Bull, hey!

23:05.660 --> 23:07.696
I'm sorry. We got lost.

23:07.697 --> 23:09.907
- It was my fault.
- Marissa filled us in.

23:09.910 --> 23:12.406
Hey, Chunk, will you go
get one of Peter's guitars

23:12.407 --> 23:13.512
and bring it to me here?

23:13.513 --> 23:14.617
Yeah.

23:15.777 --> 23:18.777
I think someone needs to play the blues.

23:20.947 --> 23:22.526
Pull!

23:24.657 --> 23:25.907
Pull!

23:31.577 --> 23:33.576
This is not beginner's luck.

23:35.577 --> 23:38.316
I lettered in archery. Maybe that helps.

23:38.317 --> 23:40.236
Still think you can get Peter Walsh off?

23:40.237 --> 23:41.616
I don't know.

23:41.617 --> 23:43.026
The jury's tough.

23:43.027 --> 23:44.446
They know Peter.

23:44.447 --> 23:46.316
That makes them prejudiced.

23:46.317 --> 23:48.576
Have you known Jason long?

23:48.577 --> 23:49.486
Seven years.

23:49.487 --> 23:51.099
He and I go back a bit further.

23:51.124 --> 23:52.576
He ever tell you about his father?

23:52.577 --> 23:53.724
I never asked.

23:53.749 --> 23:55.656
He was a real piece of work.

23:55.657 --> 23:58.200
Maybe he was just trying
to provide for his family.

23:58.225 --> 24:01.278
He stole from them, too.

24:01.303 --> 24:03.183
Pull!

24:03.910 --> 24:06.459
What did we learn from Joyce today?

24:06.484 --> 24:08.576
That if shotguns were
made out of foam rubber,

24:08.577 --> 24:09.696
I'd be an Olympian.

24:09.697 --> 24:11.225
She said you scored today.

24:11.250 --> 24:12.616
Picked up four jurors:

24:12.617 --> 24:14.696
Stu, Perry, Missy, and Andrew.

24:14.697 --> 24:16.186
Well, the bad news is

24:16.211 --> 24:18.919
there's still eight who believe
what the chief had to say.

24:18.944 --> 24:21.696
The worse news is Joyce is certain

24:21.697 --> 24:23.116
she can win the other four back.

24:23.117 --> 24:25.196
She'll drop a few rumors
and corral the herd.

24:25.197 --> 24:28.577
The comment the chief made about
your dad landed with the jury.

24:29.351 --> 24:30.456
Thanks again, Dad.

24:30.457 --> 24:31.560
Hey, Bull?

24:31.561 --> 24:34.270
Were you really the leader
of a motorcycle gang?

24:34.271 --> 24:35.680
Bull's Angels.

24:35.681 --> 24:37.100
But it was Huffys,

24:37.101 --> 24:38.470
not Harleys. I was 12.

24:38.471 --> 24:39.721
Actually, there was

24:39.724 --> 24:41.680
this kid, Eric. He was sort of a wild man.

24:41.681 --> 24:44.680
Strapped a lawnmower
engine onto his bike.

24:44.681 --> 24:46.010
Got that thing cookin'.

24:46.011 --> 24:48.390
We built a ramp down on the dock.

24:48.391 --> 24:50.270
Tried to get him to jump the lake.

24:50.271 --> 24:52.430
I thought he was gonna make it.

24:52.431 --> 24:53.862
He died.

24:54.431 --> 24:56.390
I'm kidding.

24:56.391 --> 24:59.060
Busted his legs up pretty good though.

24:59.061 --> 25:01.430
Joyce said your dad

25:01.431 --> 25:03.310
stole from you, too.

25:03.311 --> 25:05.060
Well,

25:05.061 --> 25:07.850
I had 500 bucks in my room,

25:07.851 --> 25:09.350
and my dad stole it from me.

25:09.351 --> 25:11.270
Said it was punishment.

25:11.271 --> 25:12.470
Punishment for what?

25:12.471 --> 25:13.890
Well,

25:13.891 --> 25:16.270
I had borrowed somebody's boat.

25:16.271 --> 25:18.750
It was the police chief's.

25:18.775 --> 25:20.220
Did you ever forgive him?

25:20.221 --> 25:22.010
My father...

25:22.011 --> 25:25.010
I never trusted him again.

25:25.011 --> 25:26.430
So if you can't forgive

25:26.431 --> 25:28.390
your father, what makes

25:28.391 --> 25:31.310
you think you can change our jurors'
minds about Peter?

25:33.931 --> 25:35.510
Hey.

25:35.511 --> 25:37.510
So, I've been going
over these fire cases,

25:37.511 --> 25:39.310
and something's just-just nagging me.

25:39.311 --> 25:41.270
Whoever's doing this is good.

25:41.271 --> 25:42.640
I mean

25:42.641 --> 25:44.350
professional good.

25:44.351 --> 25:46.350
Professional.

25:46.351 --> 25:48.601
You think the arsonist is a fireman.

25:57.421 --> 26:00.188
I got two pair, boys, aces and eights.

26:00.189 --> 26:02.388
If you can beat that...

26:02.389 --> 26:04.532
- I got nothing.
- Same here, Chief.

26:04.557 --> 26:05.728
Pair of kings.

26:07.729 --> 26:09.138
All right.

26:09.139 --> 26:10.978
Tough hand, Sam.

26:10.979 --> 26:12.848
Looks like you need a fourth.

26:12.849 --> 26:14.189
Mind if I sit in?

26:14.190 --> 26:15.388
What the hell do you want, Bull?

26:15.389 --> 26:16.768
Well, maybe

26:16.769 --> 26:18.268
a week in France would be nice.

26:18.269 --> 26:21.638
But I really want to know
which one of you clowns

26:21.639 --> 26:24.388
is responsible for the fire,
the one that you blame

26:24.389 --> 26:26.768
- on Peter Walsh.
- I'm gonna say this once, Bull.

26:26.769 --> 26:28.558
My men and I, we put out fires.

26:28.559 --> 26:30.428
We risk our lives in doing it.

26:30.429 --> 26:32.428
We don't expect any thank yous.

26:32.429 --> 26:33.888
It's the job.

26:33.889 --> 26:37.188
But what we do expect in return

26:37.189 --> 26:39.558
is the common decency not

26:39.559 --> 26:42.518
to be accused of arson or murder.

26:42.519 --> 26:46.518
Now, are you gonna walk
out the way you came or...

26:46.519 --> 26:47.888
I got what I came for.

26:47.889 --> 26:50.729
Thanks... Chief.

26:57.349 --> 26:59.558
So, what'd you get?

26:59.559 --> 27:03.058
I wasn't the only one bluffing in there.

27:03.059 --> 27:05.058
Follow the chief.

27:05.059 --> 27:06.808
I want to know every move he makes

27:06.809 --> 27:09.479
between now and the end of the trial.

27:11.889 --> 27:14.058
Okay.

27:14.059 --> 27:17.428
Now, the only way to convince
the people in this town

27:17.429 --> 27:19.848
you're innocent is

27:19.849 --> 27:22.598
to show them who you really are.

27:22.599 --> 27:26.598
Under stress,
your brain finds relief in music.

27:26.599 --> 27:28.428
I don't follow.

27:31.019 --> 27:36.478
Your testimony is gonna
be a basic blues riff.

27:36.479 --> 27:38.388
We're gonna show them
that you're a musician,

27:38.389 --> 27:41.728
an artist, and that you create things,

27:41.729 --> 27:43.558
not destroy them.

27:43.559 --> 27:45.928
Did you burn
down the diner that night?

27:45.929 --> 27:47.179
No, I didn't.

27:47.180 --> 27:48.428
So, you had been fired

27:48.429 --> 27:49.790
from your job.

27:49.815 --> 27:52.558
I got let go for the winter, but Mr. Keller

27:52.559 --> 27:55.228
promised he'd hire me when
the tourists come back.

27:55.229 --> 27:56.848
I wasn't angry about it.

27:56.849 --> 27:59.428
Mr. Keller and I were friends. He gave me

27:59.429 --> 28:01.518
my first Yardbirds record.

28:01.519 --> 28:03.058
I turned him on to the Black Keys.

28:03.059 --> 28:04.757
So, you like music?

28:04.782 --> 28:06.451
I love music.

28:06.476 --> 28:08.929
I've been playing
guitar since I was seven.

28:08.954 --> 28:12.405
You make guitars out of
some pretty unusual things.

28:12.406 --> 28:13.865
Guitars and amps.

28:13.866 --> 28:15.775
You know, most people
don't realize that you can

28:15.776 --> 28:19.235
make some pretty rad instruments
out of just about anything.

28:19.236 --> 28:22.485
Shovels, soda bottles, old chandeliers.

28:22.486 --> 28:26.405
This town sees you
as a dangerous criminal.

28:26.406 --> 28:28.615
But we're gonna show them that

28:28.616 --> 28:30.365
you're not the one to fear.

28:30.366 --> 28:33.365
In fact, you're afraid of them.

28:33.366 --> 28:35.954
Why don't you come
by town anymore, Peter?

28:35.979 --> 28:39.195
Well, I would. But a few
times when I've come

28:39.196 --> 28:42.366
to go dumpster diving to collect
parts to make my instruments...

28:45.906 --> 28:50.326
I've gotten accused of casing
houses to break into them.

28:51.326 --> 28:54.115
I'm just looking through the stuff that...

28:54.116 --> 28:56.276
everyone else has thrown away.

29:07.576 --> 29:10.325
Pigden's not gonna go easy on you.

29:10.326 --> 29:12.405
He's gonna want to get you angry.

29:12.430 --> 29:13.937
Whatever you do,

29:13.938 --> 29:14.990
don't.

29:15.015 --> 29:17.405
So, why does the empty
container of lighter fluid

29:17.406 --> 29:19.405
have your fingerprints all over it?

29:19.406 --> 29:21.736
- Because I use it to burn the trash.
- You had a key.

29:21.739 --> 29:23.735
To gain access.

29:23.736 --> 29:26.325
And you wanted to teach
Charles Keller a lesson,

29:26.326 --> 29:29.735
- isn't that right?
- Give me a break! No!

29:29.736 --> 29:31.905
Relax and remember,

29:31.906 --> 29:34.075
blues riff.

29:42.536 --> 29:44.695
I don't teach people

29:44.696 --> 29:46.985
a lesson. That's my brother.

29:46.986 --> 29:49.115
And I don't understand
why it's so hard for you

29:49.116 --> 29:50.905
to believe that I'm not him.

29:50.906 --> 29:55.325
Mr. Walsh, if it is really so
bad for you here in Kavanaugh,

29:55.326 --> 29:57.536
why stay?

30:00.536 --> 30:03.365
I was seven years old when my dad took off.

30:03.366 --> 30:06.148
And my mom didn't handle that well.

30:08.486 --> 30:11.535
And I think she's in a better
place now that she's passed on.

30:11.536 --> 30:15.075
But I visit her every Sunday

30:15.076 --> 30:17.155
at Chambliss Street Cemetery.

30:17.156 --> 30:19.824
My grandfather,

30:19.849 --> 30:22.535
he was born and died in
the same house I live in.

30:22.536 --> 30:24.536
Kavanaugh's my home.

30:26.906 --> 30:29.486
So where else would I go?

30:33.576 --> 30:35.905
Hey, you two. Hope you're both happy.

30:35.906 --> 30:38.115
That an innocent man is
one step closer to freedom?

30:38.116 --> 30:40.276
- Yes. We were just talking about that.
- People

30:40.279 --> 30:43.232
lost their homes,
property values are down.

30:43.257 --> 30:45.865
And we caught the son-of-a-bitch
causing all the trouble,

30:45.866 --> 30:47.485
until you strolled in

30:47.486 --> 30:48.889
with your crew of liars.

30:48.914 --> 30:50.485
I think she's referring to you.

30:50.486 --> 30:51.825
I-I got that, thank you.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.349
And you want to set him free?

30:53.350 --> 30:54.559
Collect a payday?

30:54.584 --> 30:57.585
Move on, just like your father.

30:58.600 --> 31:00.469
You can twist your Manhattan juries

31:00.470 --> 31:02.729
around your finger, but here...

31:02.730 --> 31:04.729
they listen to me.

31:07.230 --> 31:10.599
The jury is ours unless
Joyce contaminates them.

31:10.600 --> 31:13.269
I think we made her angry.

31:13.270 --> 31:15.889
Angry enough to tip her hand.

31:15.890 --> 31:17.889
You know how Joyce controls this town?

31:17.890 --> 31:20.179
Through gossip.

31:20.180 --> 31:22.970
And gossip is how we're
gonna take her down.

31:29.535 --> 31:31.940
Well, it's hay fever season.

31:31.965 --> 31:33.414
Time to sneeze.

31:33.415 --> 31:35.374
Okay.

31:35.375 --> 31:36.605
What did you have in mind?

31:36.630 --> 31:38.759
Something my dad would appreciate.

31:38.784 --> 31:41.414
The jury's listening to Joyce,

31:41.415 --> 31:44.124
we're gonna turn them
against her with a rumor.

31:44.125 --> 31:46.504
Dad always told me people
can't be sold something

31:46.505 --> 31:49.204
unless they want to buy it.

31:49.205 --> 31:52.771
How about Joyce is negotiating a deal,

31:52.796 --> 31:56.254
200 room resort with golf course,

31:56.255 --> 31:58.664
and spa?

31:58.665 --> 31:59.914
That's good.

31:59.915 --> 32:03.255
All over the county flannel
undies are bunching.

32:10.505 --> 32:12.005
Who's driving?

32:14.546 --> 32:15.546
There you go.

32:16.585 --> 32:17.834
Hey. Right on time.

32:17.835 --> 32:19.334
Hey. Good to see you.

32:19.335 --> 32:20.504
Do we look okay?

32:20.505 --> 32:21.754
We were told business professional.

32:21.755 --> 32:23.124
You guys look great.

32:23.125 --> 32:26.294
I might have lost the ties,
but why quibble?

32:26.295 --> 32:29.334
So, what we're gonna
do here today is,

32:29.335 --> 32:31.334
sort of like Simon Says.

32:31.335 --> 32:32.874
And right now,
you're gonna look to your left.

32:32.875 --> 32:35.464
You see that fountain over there?

32:35.465 --> 32:38.044
I'd like you to make a dismissive motion

32:38.045 --> 32:40.232
with your hand, like you're
just gonna level that thing.

32:40.256 --> 32:41.342
Yeah. There we go.

32:41.367 --> 32:43.464
Now, I'm gonna say
something really funny.

32:43.465 --> 32:45.254
Ready? And you're laughing.

32:47.375 --> 32:48.914
God bless America.

32:48.915 --> 32:50.374
All right, do you see that woman

32:50.375 --> 32:51.624
in the cranberry jacket behind me?

32:51.625 --> 32:53.004
Sure do.

32:53.005 --> 32:54.294
Give her a wave.

32:54.295 --> 32:55.464
You know her.

32:55.465 --> 32:58.254
You know her. She's the best.

32:58.255 --> 32:59.420
Did she wave back?

32:59.421 --> 33:00.584
She sure did.

33:00.585 --> 33:02.544
Okay, let's give
it a couple seconds.

33:12.241 --> 33:13.998
All right. We're done.

33:14.023 --> 33:15.204
Thanks for coming out.

33:15.205 --> 33:17.374
That's it? That's all you need?

33:17.375 --> 33:19.374
That is all I need.

33:19.375 --> 33:21.545
Thanks, everyone.

33:35.415 --> 33:37.464
How's it going?

33:37.465 --> 33:39.464
They're all blaming
Joyce for our planted story

33:39.465 --> 33:41.047
about the hotel development.

33:41.072 --> 33:42.704
People are losing their minds.

33:42.705 --> 33:44.960
It's almost scary how
quickly it's spreading.

33:44.985 --> 33:46.575
- It's like...
- Feathers.

33:47.295 --> 33:48.664
You know, there's this old story

33:48.665 --> 33:51.204
about a man who spread a nasty rumor

33:51.205 --> 33:52.664
about a rival shopkeeper,

33:52.665 --> 33:54.584
and it spread throughout the shtetl.

33:54.585 --> 33:56.794
I'm taking this man was Jewish,

33:56.795 --> 33:58.664
and he lived in Eastern Europe.

33:58.665 --> 34:00.374
It's an old story. Yeah.

34:00.375 --> 34:01.914
Benny, take note.

34:01.915 --> 34:04.124
Let's incorporate this into your closing.

34:04.125 --> 34:06.294
The gossip stuck,

34:06.295 --> 34:08.543
and the shopkeeper was
driven from the town.

34:08.545 --> 34:10.533
So the man felt bad

34:10.558 --> 34:14.414
about the gossip he had
spread about his rival,

34:14.415 --> 34:16.414
so he went to his rabbi to ask

34:16.415 --> 34:19.043
how he could undo what he had done.

34:19.045 --> 34:20.623
So the rabbi said,

34:20.625 --> 34:22.704
take a pillow to the town square,

34:22.705 --> 34:26.664
cut it open, and shake
it until it was empty.

34:26.665 --> 34:28.754
So the man did that.

34:28.755 --> 34:31.083
So the rabbi said, now go,

34:31.085 --> 34:32.583
and pick up all the feathers

34:32.585 --> 34:34.004
and stick them back in the pillow.

34:34.005 --> 34:37.333
"Impossible," said the man.

34:37.335 --> 34:39.293
Exactly.

34:39.295 --> 34:41.873
Once a piece of gossip

34:41.875 --> 34:43.623
leaves your mouth,

34:43.625 --> 34:46.583
you can't put it back.

34:46.585 --> 34:49.583
Peter Walsh did not burn down that diner,

34:49.585 --> 34:52.333
nor did he kill Charles Keller.

34:52.335 --> 34:54.004
And despite a lack of evidence,

34:54.005 --> 34:55.914
some of you still think he did.

34:55.915 --> 34:59.844
I notice everyone wearing
the buttons that say,

34:59.869 --> 35:01.704
"No Resort in Kavanaugh."

35:01.705 --> 35:05.164
Well, the rumors of a
resort coming to Kavanaugh...

35:05.165 --> 35:06.704
are not true.

35:06.705 --> 35:11.044
That's right, we made that
up to illustrate a point.

35:11.045 --> 35:14.704
You know the seven men and women in suits

35:14.705 --> 35:16.704
who came into town yesterday?

35:16.705 --> 35:18.584
Hired drivers from Boston.

35:18.585 --> 35:21.414
And yet, due to gossip,

35:21.415 --> 35:24.719
today the town is up in
arms and pointing fingers

35:24.744 --> 35:28.164
at one of their good friends.

35:29.665 --> 35:31.704
It's not true.

35:31.705 --> 35:34.204
That's the point.

35:34.205 --> 35:36.294
Gossip spreads like wildfire

35:36.295 --> 35:38.464
and can destroy this town!

35:38.465 --> 35:40.544
That's how gossip works.

35:40.545 --> 35:43.794
And the greatest victim of it
sits with us right here today.

35:43.795 --> 35:45.795
Peter Walsh.

35:47.165 --> 35:48.965
Innocent man.

35:54.875 --> 35:57.044
On the two charges

35:57.045 --> 36:00.037
of arson and murder in the second degree,

36:00.062 --> 36:01.642
how does the jury find?

36:03.005 --> 36:06.084
We the jury find the defendant,

36:06.085 --> 36:08.834
Peter Walsh...

36:08.859 --> 36:10.834
not guilty on both counts.

36:12.295 --> 36:14.834
This case is ended.

36:14.835 --> 36:17.164
The defendant is free to go.

36:17.189 --> 36:19.124
The court is adjourned.

36:20.134 --> 36:21.195
This is...

36:21.220 --> 36:23.544
You guys are really...

36:23.545 --> 36:26.004
I-I can't... I can't believe this.

36:26.005 --> 36:27.504
Th... Thank you.

36:27.505 --> 36:29.023
Of course.

36:29.048 --> 36:31.107
Now, listen, I want one
of those electric shovels.

36:31.132 --> 36:32.568
Can you make that happen?

36:32.569 --> 36:34.358
Yeah, I think so.

36:34.359 --> 36:35.569
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

36:38.859 --> 36:40.069
Bull.

36:41.359 --> 36:43.948
When you said the arsonist was one of us,

36:43.949 --> 36:45.528
it didn't sit well with me.

36:45.529 --> 36:47.529
Yeah, I got that impression.

36:49.489 --> 36:51.488
But...

36:51.489 --> 36:54.358
I went through the evidence
from the other fires again.

36:54.359 --> 36:56.948
Sure enough, something stuck out.

36:56.949 --> 36:58.398
One of my firemen,

36:58.399 --> 37:00.398
he was always the first to go in.

37:00.399 --> 37:03.358
If you know where the first started...

37:03.359 --> 37:05.608
He was destroying evidence.

37:05.609 --> 37:06.898
Sam Keane.

37:06.899 --> 37:09.171
He's at the sheriff's station right now.

37:10.359 --> 37:12.778
I found this at your...
cabin after the fire.

37:12.779 --> 37:14.779
It belongs to you.

37:23.819 --> 37:26.358
Well, what do you know?
There's my 500 bucks.

37:28.069 --> 37:30.279
You're not your father, Jason.

37:32.319 --> 37:34.698
Thank you, Chief.

37:34.699 --> 37:36.699
For the fireman's fund.

37:39.449 --> 37:41.069
Thank you.

37:48.359 --> 37:49.549
Aw...

37:49.550 --> 37:50.738
Let me s...

37:50.739 --> 37:52.358
Ho, look how cute you were.

37:52.359 --> 37:54.858
Don't let Benny see
that fish... He'll get jealous.

37:54.859 --> 37:56.569
You're right.

37:57.859 --> 37:59.488
So, Sam Keane.

37:59.489 --> 38:01.489
That's interesting, isn't it?

38:01.492 --> 38:03.198
I watched Sam Keane fold a winning hand

38:03.199 --> 38:05.278
because he didn't want to beat his boss.

38:05.279 --> 38:07.135
He is a classic subordinate.

38:07.160 --> 38:08.488
You think he didn't do it.

38:08.489 --> 38:12.158
Someone else is pulling the strings.

38:12.159 --> 38:14.319
Pull!

38:16.949 --> 38:18.778
Joyce.

38:18.779 --> 38:20.988
You know better than to startle a woman

38:20.989 --> 38:22.488
with a shotgun, don't you?

38:22.489 --> 38:23.968
It's interesting.

38:23.993 --> 38:25.422
You know, we were spreading this rumor

38:25.446 --> 38:27.179
about you buying up all the properties

38:27.204 --> 38:29.358
so this development that came
to town would make you a lot

38:29.359 --> 38:31.358
of money, and it turns out that's true.

38:31.359 --> 38:33.488
I took advantage of
some unfortunate events.

38:33.489 --> 38:34.985
Nothing illegal about that.

38:35.010 --> 38:37.892
No. Sam Keane said he set those fires.

38:37.893 --> 38:39.932
But he also said

38:39.933 --> 38:41.762
you paid him to do it.

38:41.763 --> 38:43.762
He flipped on you for a plea deal.

38:43.763 --> 38:46.262
Makes you an accessory to murder.

38:53.223 --> 38:55.263
I always hated you.

38:57.643 --> 38:59.642
All right, Joyce.

38:59.643 --> 39:01.932
Here we go.

39:01.933 --> 39:04.052
Somehow that makes me feel better.

39:04.053 --> 39:05.303
Pull!

39:10.143 --> 39:12.592
Hey, guys, I got one!

39:12.593 --> 39:14.335
All right, Benny!

39:14.360 --> 39:16.352
Crap. Never mind.

39:16.353 --> 39:17.592
All right, Bull,

39:17.593 --> 39:18.972
tell us the real story.

39:18.973 --> 39:20.142
Yeah. Why'd you keep

39:20.143 --> 39:22.592
your dad's cabin all these years?

39:22.593 --> 39:24.302
Well, I guess I just had this fantasy

39:24.303 --> 39:26.182
that one day I'd come back up here and...

39:26.183 --> 39:28.262
set things straight.

39:28.263 --> 39:29.762
Well, it's not a fantasy now?

39:29.763 --> 39:31.802
I guess not.

39:31.803 --> 39:33.824
Would've been nice to have Dad up here

39:33.849 --> 39:35.229
to see how things turned out.

39:36.433 --> 39:37.642
When did he pass away?

39:37.643 --> 39:39.392
He's not dead... He lives in Florida.

39:42.093 --> 39:43.093
Yes!

39:44.473 --> 39:45.973
- Whoo!
- Easy, ea-easy.

39:45.998 --> 39:47.451
- Ooh, ooh, ooh!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
