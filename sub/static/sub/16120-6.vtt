00:01.800 --> 00:03.768
Man:
Good morning, New Orleans,
good morning.

00:03.800 --> 00:07.258
- It's Andre All Day and...
- DJ Reggie G. here--

00:07.300 --> 00:09.359
at KCEW Radio,
coming at you

00:09.410 --> 00:13.278
with two incredibly talented
and lovely young ladies--

00:13.310 --> 00:16.245
Nova Bordelon from
the "New Orleans Daily News"

00:16.280 --> 00:19.113
and BLM activist
Chantal Williams.

00:19.150 --> 00:22.039
- We're big fans
of yours, Miss Nova.
- Thank you, Andre.

00:22.090 --> 00:25.514
That article you wrote
clone shook up this
whole town, okay?

00:25.550 --> 00:27.552
You pointing fingers
at the popo,

00:27.590 --> 00:29.387
the D.A.'s office,
the governor, the mayor.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.250
You just went and called out
everybody, all right?

00:31.290 --> 00:34.123
Blaming the current
administration,
the old one...

00:34.160 --> 00:36.424
Reggie and I don't know
if we're safe sitting
up in here

00:36.470 --> 00:38.791
after having you on our show.
Ain't that right, Reggie?

00:38.830 --> 00:40.798
Man, I swear, Jindal gonna
roll up in his Prius

00:40.840 --> 00:43.058
with his homies
and just, like,
take us all out.

00:43.110 --> 00:44.566
Whoo!

00:44.610 --> 00:46.532
So, how is our boy,
Too Sweet?

00:46.580 --> 00:50.141
Uh, well, he just
got out of a four-hour
surgery yesterday,

00:50.180 --> 00:52.819
and today he's back
in federal prison.

00:52.850 --> 00:55.171
He's a minor arrested
for a misdemeanor

00:55.220 --> 00:57.688
and he's sitting
in NOLA Parish jail.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.415
Yeah, that's how
they do you.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.348
That's how they
do you if you're poor,
if you're black,

01:01.390 --> 01:02.823
- if you live in the 9th...
- Andre: Preach!

01:02.860 --> 01:05.488
Nova's article highlights
what we've known for years.

01:05.530 --> 01:07.828
The over-policing
of our community always ends

01:07.860 --> 01:10.328
in the over-incarceration
of black youth.

01:10.370 --> 01:12.429
Oh, that article was bomb.

01:12.470 --> 01:14.233
- Yeah, you know
what else is bomb?
- What else is bomb?

01:14.270 --> 01:15.828
She's Charley
Bordelon-West's sister.

01:15.870 --> 01:17.428
- Ain't that right?
- That's right, but--

01:17.470 --> 01:19.700
And I got a feeling
that Charley Bordelon-West

01:19.740 --> 01:21.708
just might drop
that "West" for good.
What you think, Reggie?

01:21.740 --> 01:23.446
Oh, yeah,
that's all over
and done with, man.

01:23.480 --> 01:25.573
I think we all seen her
march down there on that court

01:25.610 --> 01:27.316
and push
that brother around.

01:27.350 --> 01:30.217
I mean, this man's
6'7", 250 pounds.

01:30.250 --> 01:31.512
I mean, homegirl
wasn't playing.

01:31.550 --> 01:32.710
You can't do nothing
with that, man.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.751
Oh, I could damn sure try.

01:34.790 --> 01:37.657
Come on, guys.
Guys, I'm not here
to talk about my family.

01:37.690 --> 01:39.897
What Chantal and I
would like to talk about

01:39.930 --> 01:41.852
is how we can enact change

01:41.900 --> 01:43.458
as a community.

01:43.500 --> 01:45.468
As Nova mentioned
In her article,

01:45.500 --> 01:47.536
eight out of 10 people
arrested in Louisiana

01:47.570 --> 01:49.458
can't even afford
an attorney.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.762
Wait, Reggie.
What was the name
of that crazy thot

01:51.810 --> 01:53.778
that set your drawers
on fire?

01:53.810 --> 01:56.142
Man, let it go.
You just gonna put my business
out there like that?

01:56.180 --> 01:57.875
- Andre: I always do.
- Miranda, man.

01:57.910 --> 01:59.741
Andre:
Miranda Rights!
You have the right...

01:59.780 --> 02:01.748
- Hey, you.
- Hi.

02:01.780 --> 02:03.748
Andre:
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

02:03.790 --> 02:06.258
one will be provided
for you.

02:06.290 --> 02:08.884
Unless you
live in Louisiana,
which is why we started

02:08.920 --> 02:12.219
a FundMe page
for Too Sweet
to help him get one.

02:12.260 --> 02:14.626
Reggie:
Chantal, are you single?

02:14.660 --> 02:15.888
You're up early.

02:15.930 --> 02:18.228
Nova's on the radio.

02:18.270 --> 02:20.636
_ - Nova: _
I'm just gonna segue Into--
- Andre: Let's go to the lines.

02:20.670 --> 02:22.763
Woman:
Hi, yeah,
this is for Nova.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.904
Did your sister know
Davis was sleeping
with prostitutes?

02:25.940 --> 02:27.635
Reggie:
Ooo, hoo hoo!

02:27.680 --> 02:30.501
- Wait, what is this?
- ( laughing over radio )

02:30.550 --> 02:33.917
It's supposed to be
about Too Sweet.

02:33.950 --> 02:35.918
Let's keep the questions
to Too Sweet

02:35.950 --> 02:37.918
or my article,
thank you.

02:37.950 --> 02:39.281
Okay, um...

02:39.320 --> 02:40.389
we got Shawn on line two.

02:40.420 --> 02:41.910
No, I'm good.

02:41.960 --> 02:43.780
Shawn:
Andre, you seen
that Goldie's ass?

02:43.830 --> 02:45.650
I ain't mad at Davis.
That's all I'm saying.

02:45.690 --> 02:47.419
- Andre: Ooh!
- Nova: Hey, y'all, come on.

02:47.460 --> 02:51.965
Andre:
Goldie--
Goldie has a fat ass.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.969
This has got to be
awful for Nova.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.934
( radio continues )

02:56.970 --> 02:58.801
Awful for Nova?

02:58.840 --> 03:00.535
Andre:
You just say, "Ahh!"

03:00.580 --> 03:02.468
Yeah, yeah.
That's mine.
Stay away from that.

03:02.510 --> 03:04.978
Shawn:
Shoot, that Goldie
knew what she was doing.

03:05.010 --> 03:08.446
What these hoes think
when they go up to a room
with a whole basketball team?

03:08.480 --> 03:11.540
- Play charades or something?
- ( men laughing )

03:11.590 --> 03:14.286
- Okay, okay, that's enough.
- Reggie: True dat, true dat.
There you go.

03:14.320 --> 03:16.857
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Nova, you don't agree
with that?

03:16.890 --> 03:20.553
Nova: Yeah, I have no idea
what happened, but I think
we need to ask ourselves

03:20.600 --> 03:24.889
why women who come forward
to report rape are always
to blame.

03:24.930 --> 03:28.696
Why do we always
portray the victim
as having asked for it?

03:28.740 --> 03:30.708
Andre:
And we're gonna go to
a commercial break right now.

03:30.740 --> 03:35.473
Wait, did she just call
Milena Galoudian the victim?

03:39.050 --> 03:42.247
She should keep
her bleeding heart
politics to herself.

03:44.750 --> 03:47.583
( theme music playing )

03:47.620 --> 03:51.579
* Dreams never die,
take flight, as the
world turns *

03:51.630 --> 03:55.452
* Dreams never die,
take flight, as the world
turns *

03:55.500 --> 03:57.764
* Keep the colors
in the lines, take flight *

03:59.640 --> 04:01.665
* Dreams never die

04:07.380 --> 04:11.339
* Keep the colors
in the lines *

04:11.380 --> 04:14.315
* Keep the colors
in the lines, take flight. *

04:16.990 --> 04:19.481
Baby, she didn't
mean anything by that.

04:19.520 --> 04:22.387
I just can't take
any more of this.
I can't--

04:22.430 --> 04:24.022
Why don't you come
to church with me and Blue?

04:24.060 --> 04:26.620
I'm gonna go pick him up
for 9:00 mass.

04:26.660 --> 04:30.027
_ I have a conference call
With DaVIS and our accountant

04:30.070 --> 04:33.039
because on Tuesday
we're paying the victim

04:33.070 --> 04:36.631
a whole hell
of a lot of money
so this doesn't go to trial.

04:36.670 --> 04:39.377
And then I've got to meet
with Remy because we still

04:39.410 --> 04:41.901
don't have a farm manager
or anything to put
in the ground.

04:41.940 --> 04:43.942
Okay, hold on.

04:43.980 --> 04:46.540
Now, Remy had me invite
Prosper over tonight

04:46.580 --> 04:49.378
so that you could ask him
to be your farm manager.

04:49.420 --> 04:51.581
Ralph Angel and Nova
gonna be there, too,

04:51.620 --> 04:53.918
so it's not all on you.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.554
You'll apologize
to Prosper.

04:56.590 --> 04:58.683
My cooking
will do the rest.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.522
All right?

05:02.570 --> 05:04.299
Yeah, okay.

05:12.110 --> 05:16.547
It'll all be okay.

05:16.580 --> 05:20.539
- ( both laughing )
- Sorry. I had no idea
that was gonna happen.

05:20.580 --> 05:22.741
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.815
Do you wanna grab
some lunch or something?

05:24.850 --> 05:27.114
Uh, I have to go
meet my editor.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.084
Well, then,
let me give you my number.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.052
( buttons clicking )

05:34.760 --> 05:36.819
- ( phone buzzing )
- Hello?

05:36.870 --> 05:39.020
Oh, hey, Chantal.
I'd love to hang.

05:39.070 --> 05:41.561
Call me later. Bye.

05:41.600 --> 05:42.999
Oh, my God.

05:43.040 --> 05:46.100
I love your necklace.
Is that Ganesh?

05:46.140 --> 05:48.108
Yeah.

05:48.140 --> 05:52.042
It's the Hindu goddess
of obstacles.

05:52.080 --> 05:55.709
Also the remover
of obstacles.

05:55.750 --> 05:58.719
- 'Cause isn't that
what we do?
- Yeah.

05:58.750 --> 06:00.581
That's what we do.

06:00.620 --> 06:02.156
You know what?

06:02.190 --> 06:04.579
Yeah.

06:04.630 --> 06:06.598
No, don't take it off.

06:06.630 --> 06:10.498
- Oh, my God,
are you kidding me?
- I want you to have it.

06:10.530 --> 06:13.863
You are doing...

06:13.900 --> 06:17.006
very important work.

06:17.040 --> 06:20.168
And you have a whole lot
more work to do,

06:20.210 --> 06:25.147
and opposition
is coming your way.

06:25.180 --> 06:28.513
- I couldn't take this.
- Let's just think of it
as a loan.

06:28.550 --> 06:29.915
Okay?

06:30.920 --> 06:32.182
And don't worry.

06:32.220 --> 06:33.983
You gonna give it
back to me.

06:37.660 --> 06:39.059
Thank you.

06:39.090 --> 06:42.560
Yeah.
Looks right on you.

06:42.600 --> 06:43.919
( clears throat )

06:43.970 --> 06:46.029
So, don't forget
your message.

06:46.070 --> 06:49.733
You promised
you were gonna call me.

06:51.070 --> 06:52.799
All right.

06:55.110 --> 06:57.704
When can
I drive this, Pops?

06:57.750 --> 06:59.638
- By yourself?
- Yeah.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.568
I don't know.

07:01.620 --> 07:04.509
I guess I started driving
a tractor when I was 12.

07:04.550 --> 07:05.539
- 12?
- 12.

07:05.590 --> 07:07.512
That's too long.

07:07.560 --> 07:10.529
- There ain't no rush.
- There y'all are!

07:10.560 --> 07:12.994
I've been calling all morning.
Why didn't you answer?

07:13.030 --> 07:14.554
Sorry.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.693
Had the ringer off.

07:16.730 --> 07:18.925
Still trying to get
used to this thing.

07:18.970 --> 07:20.597
- ( touch tones beeping )
- You got a new phone?

07:20.640 --> 07:22.528
Blue:
There's games
on it, too.

07:22.570 --> 07:24.709
Games on it, too?

07:26.240 --> 07:28.674
Why don't you come
go to church with us?

07:28.710 --> 07:30.473
I can't.

07:30.510 --> 07:31.943
I gotta go
to the warehouse
In an hour.

07:31.980 --> 07:33.845
Please come
With us, Pop?

07:33.880 --> 07:36.542
I can't, but I promise
we'll do something fun
tomorrow.

07:36.590 --> 07:40.082
- Okay.
- All right.
Here, take this.

07:40.120 --> 07:44.557
Y'all go get
some brunch on me.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.558
Where did you get
all this money from?

07:46.600 --> 07:48.090
I'm a working man.

07:48.130 --> 07:51.099
I got a job now,
remember?

07:51.130 --> 07:53.030
All right, let's go.

07:53.070 --> 07:55.095
( clears throat )
Best get back to what
I'm doing.

07:55.140 --> 07:57.028
See you later.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.111
There he is.

08:07.150 --> 08:09.015
Just the man
I was trying to find.

08:11.090 --> 08:13.058
I thought I'd come out
to that farm of yours
tonight,

08:13.090 --> 08:15.285
- take a look around.
- Can't. Got plans.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.629
Any time's good,
really.

08:20.700 --> 08:23.624
Got something new
coming in-- laptops.

08:23.670 --> 08:26.594
Yeah, about that.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.130
We even now.

08:28.170 --> 08:30.604
For the mother stalk.

08:30.640 --> 08:34.076
I sold a few phones,
but you can have
the rest back.

08:34.110 --> 08:35.600
I'm good.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.904
- Oh, you good now?
- I'm good.

08:37.950 --> 08:40.145
Ain't_ no return
policy, bruh.

08:40.180 --> 08:41.738
Yeah, you see, uh,

08:41.780 --> 08:44.010
you just getting
warmed up.

08:44.050 --> 08:46.280
I ain't doing this
no more.

08:46.320 --> 08:49.153
Look, man, when you
drove out that gate
with a bag full of phones,

08:49.190 --> 08:50.828
you made your decision.

08:50.860 --> 08:52.282
You in the game now.

08:52.330 --> 08:54.628
As a matter of fact,
yeah, we need you

08:54.660 --> 08:56.025
to stash some stuff
out that farm of yours.

08:56.060 --> 08:57.766
I ain't about to do that.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.098
Wasn't really
a question, bruh.

09:09.080 --> 09:10.206
(mm)

09:13.150 --> 09:14.572
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:14.620 --> 09:17.214
Let me just get my purse.
Want me to drive?

09:17.250 --> 09:19.047
( laughs )

09:19.090 --> 09:21.183
In the South...

09:21.220 --> 09:25.088
unless a man clone lost
his legs, he drives.

09:25.130 --> 09:27.098
And even then...

09:27.130 --> 09:29.724
- Noted.
- ( laughing )

09:29.770 --> 09:32.330
So, we're not gonna go to LSU.
I got a call from my contact.

09:32.370 --> 09:35.089
They're all sold out
of mother stalk.

09:35.140 --> 09:37.005
- So, you got two options.
- ( sighs )

09:37.040 --> 09:39.065
Special order
from another state,

09:39.110 --> 09:40.930
but that would take
a few weeks.

09:40.980 --> 09:42.845
Or?

09:42.880 --> 09:45.804
You can plant a new
seed cane variety
that I designed.

09:45.850 --> 09:48.011
That you designed?

09:48.050 --> 09:49.244
What does that mean?

09:49.280 --> 09:51.817
I have been working

09:51.850 --> 09:55.251
from a university grant
for the past three years.

09:55.290 --> 09:57.349
Most new cane varieties

09:57.390 --> 10:01.349
are created
by big agro companies
tested in Florida.

10:01.400 --> 10:04.392
But the soil is completely
different in Florida
than it is here.

10:04.430 --> 10:07.866
My cane variety
adjusts for that.

10:07.900 --> 10:10.368
It should produce
a higher sugar content, too.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.037
- It should?
- Well...

10:12.070 --> 10:14.106
I've only tested it
in small batches.

10:14.140 --> 10:15.835
Never a full harvest.

10:15.880 --> 10:18.178
I haven't gotten
any local farmers
to try it.

10:18.210 --> 10:19.916
Why not?

10:19.950 --> 10:21.372
Well, truth be told,

10:21.420 --> 10:23.047
it's hard
to conVInce a farmer

10:23.090 --> 10:25.741
to take a shot
on something like
his livelihood.

10:25.790 --> 10:28.258
Well, the stakes are
pretty high for me, too.

10:28.290 --> 10:30.781
Is there
a refund policy?

10:30.830 --> 10:32.024
No.

10:33.930 --> 10:36.194
- Uh...
- It's free.

10:38.170 --> 10:40.934
Just trying
to get somebody
to take a chance on me.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.173
All right.

10:49.210 --> 10:51.178
You got yourself a deal.

10:54.220 --> 10:57.041
* Breathe

10:57.090 --> 11:00.059
* Breathe with me...

11:01.320 --> 11:03.220
( phone rings )

11:05.090 --> 11:07.149
Hello?

11:07.200 --> 11:10.067
Woman:
_I have a collect call from
inmate Devonte Bonclair.

11:10.100 --> 11:11.920
Do you accept
the charges?

11:11.970 --> 11:13.130
Yes.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.762
Hey, Miss Nova.

11:18.810 --> 11:20.175
Nova :
Hey, Too Sweet.

11:20.210 --> 11:22.201
It's good
to hear your voice.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.969
How you feeling?

11:25.210 --> 11:27.371
They got me
in the infirmary.

11:30.120 --> 11:34.079
I'm supposed
to be walking around,
so I asked to call you.

11:34.120 --> 11:37.226
So, yeah,
I'm probably gonna be
in my cell tomorrow.

11:39.130 --> 11:41.223
It's kind of soon.

11:41.260 --> 11:43.990
They don't give me
a choice.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.093
Hang in there, baby.

11:51.240 --> 11:53.401
I'm not gonna make it.

11:56.140 --> 11:58.938
Yes, you are.
You are gonna make it.

11:58.980 --> 12:00.777
I'm gonna get you
out of there.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.087
Do I have
a public defender yet?

12:05.120 --> 12:08.248
- No, but--
- A trial date?

12:08.290 --> 12:11.020
You need a lawyer first.

12:11.060 --> 12:12.755
Bail money?

12:12.800 --> 12:14.097
Not yet.

12:14.130 --> 12:16.121
Then when
am I getting out?

12:20.800 --> 12:24.008
I don't know.

12:24.040 --> 12:26.361
We can't get a bail
reduction until we
get you a lavwer.

12:26.410 --> 12:28.878
And there's a wait list.

12:36.050 --> 12:38.041
Too Sweet,
you there, baby?

12:44.060 --> 12:45.925
You know,
when I gotjumped...

12:48.830 --> 12:50.821
I didn't know
who did it.

12:55.440 --> 12:58.568
The guards was
standing right there

12:58.610 --> 13:01.101
watching the whole time.

13:06.510 --> 13:09.980
I can see ifI can_
get you moved to solitary.

13:13.360 --> 13:17.319
Remember when I told you
to put your mind elsewhere?

13:19.090 --> 13:21.320
That didn't work out
too good.

13:25.330 --> 13:26.524
Let's go.

13:35.610 --> 13:37.339
( knocking )

13:37.380 --> 13:39.473
Remy, come on in.

13:41.620 --> 13:45.340
Ah, tulips,
my favorite.

13:45.390 --> 13:47.483
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

13:47.520 --> 13:50.353
- Let me put them
in some water.
- Okay.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.997
- What?_
- You always arrive early.

13:55.030 --> 13:57.089
That's good
home training.

13:57.130 --> 14:00.236
But remember,
I'm here to make _sure
that you get this right.

14:00.270 --> 14:02.192
- Oh?
- Yeah.

14:02.240 --> 14:04.629
Coach you through it.
Give you a few tips.

14:04.670 --> 14:06.501
Coach me through what?

14:06.540 --> 14:09.270
This is your third time
up at bat with Prosper.

14:09.310 --> 14:11.471
Okay? We're not going
to get another chance.

14:11.510 --> 14:15.514
So, always look him
in the eye.

14:15.550 --> 14:18.610
And your head is never
to dip at a 45-degree angle.

14:18.650 --> 14:21.016
So...

14:21.060 --> 14:22.880
noiPhone.

14:24.130 --> 14:26.155
Fine, no phone.

14:26.190 --> 14:28.397
- What else?
- Ralph Angel: Hey.

14:28.430 --> 14:30.261
Hey, just in time.

14:30.300 --> 14:32.268
What you saying,
Remy?

14:32.300 --> 14:34.165
Some time for what?

14:34.200 --> 14:37.260
A little lesson
on how to talk to Prosper.

14:37.310 --> 14:40.404
Now, Ralph Angel,
Prosper's been in
the game a long time.

14:40.440 --> 14:43.375
All right?
So, even if you
don't agree,

14:43.410 --> 14:46.447
don't question
the man's methods.

14:46.480 --> 14:49.540
I swear, if you mess
this up again...

14:49.580 --> 14:52.242
- Hey, Remy.
Hey, everyone.
- Hey.

14:52.290 --> 14:54.019
Hey, Charley.

14:59.560 --> 15:01.198
Hey.

15:03.030 --> 15:04.998
- Charley, what's wrong?
- I don't know.

15:05.030 --> 15:08.033
I'm still processing
some of the incredibly
personal things

15:08.070 --> 15:10.129
you said about me
on the radio this morning.

15:10.170 --> 15:13.037
- I didn't say anything.
- Okay, we've got company.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.002
Y'all leave this alone
for now.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.179
Nova:
Wait, did you listen
to the whole interview?

15:17.210 --> 15:20.043
- Did she?
- Here, put this
on the table, please.

15:20.080 --> 15:22.139
Andre and Reggie
were just playing around.

15:22.180 --> 15:23.442
They say a bunch
of stupid stuff.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.139
The only thing
that sounded stupid

15:25.190 --> 15:27.681
was you calling
Davis's accuser a victim!

15:27.720 --> 15:30.553
- Oh, come on, Charley.
- What made you think
that was a good idea?

15:30.590 --> 15:32.558
So, how's Blue
liking school this year?

15:32.590 --> 15:34.194
Uh, he like it.

15:34.230 --> 15:36.698
- He got
a real good teacher.
- Huh.

15:36.730 --> 15:39.961
Charley: It says something
that you would even go
on a program like that!

15:40.000 --> 15:43.436
- Nova: This ain't my fault.
- We_ need to start
drinking now.

15:43.470 --> 15:46.166
How could you
call the prostitute
coming after Davis

15:46.210 --> 15:49.304
the victim when you know
nothing about it?

15:49.340 --> 15:50.705
I did not call her
a Victim.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.706
See, you're twisting
my words around now.

15:52.750 --> 15:56.049
What I said was
that's how rape victims
who come forward are portrayed.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.186
What you said sounded
like my sister calling
my husband a rapist.

15:59.220 --> 16:01.586
- Could maybe y'all
talk about this later?
- Come on, girls.

16:01.620 --> 16:04.180
So, suddenly
you believe in Davis now?

16:04.230 --> 16:06.255
He hasn't been truthful
about a single thing so far.

16:06.290 --> 16:08.599
If that whore,
Milena Galoudian,

16:08.630 --> 16:10.495
is such a victim,
then why is she asking

16:10.530 --> 16:14.990
for a $3 million payout
from us to make this go away?

16:17.770 --> 16:21.001
Well, that is one
expensive piece of ass.

16:21.040 --> 16:22.530
( man clears throat)

16:36.290 --> 16:39.657
Violet, this was
an amazing meal.

16:42.060 --> 16:44.699
- I'm glad y'all liked it.
- Yep.

16:44.730 --> 16:47.528
Ever since Claire passed,

16:47.570 --> 16:49.128
I don't get many
home-cooked meals.

16:49.170 --> 16:51.161
You know what
I'm talking about, Remy,

16:51.210 --> 16:53.508
after your Shauna passed?

16:53.540 --> 16:55.576
A lot of takeout
and microwave meals.

16:57.580 --> 17:00.469
Well, not a day goes by
that I don't think about her.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.245
And I lost a...

17:04.290 --> 17:06.645
lot of friends
these last few years.

17:06.690 --> 17:09.716
And losing Brother Ernest
was toughest of all.

17:09.760 --> 17:12.729
I never thought
he'd be called before me.

17:12.760 --> 17:15.558
Which is why I'm here.

17:17.700 --> 17:19.588
Because I don't feel
like your hearts are
really in it.

17:19.630 --> 17:21.530
That ain't true,
Mr. Prosper.

17:21.570 --> 17:23.800
- I don't think
you understand--
- Is it true...

17:23.840 --> 17:28.402
that you're planning
on going one harvest,
and then selling?

17:28.440 --> 17:30.305
Because if that's
your attitude,

17:30.350 --> 17:32.568
then that's gonna
be mine as well.

17:34.250 --> 17:37.139
Now, I'll agree to be
your farm manager,

17:37.190 --> 17:39.545
plus the regular salary,

17:44.190 --> 17:47.751
I promise I won't
steer you wrong.

17:50.330 --> 17:52.696
It's gonna take
a lot of hard work,

17:52.730 --> 17:55.233
and if you work together,

17:55.270 --> 17:58.637
like your father
wanted you to,

17:58.670 --> 18:00.479
it can be done.

18:08.750 --> 18:11.389
All right.
That'll work.

18:17.690 --> 18:19.578
Violet, you got another
piece of that pie?

18:19.630 --> 18:22.599
( all laughing )

18:22.630 --> 18:24.723
Absolutely.

18:24.770 --> 18:28.729
I pulled out my best
recipe for Prosper.

18:28.770 --> 18:31.204
Whoa! You tell
Holleood about that?

18:31.240 --> 18:33.208
( all laughing )

18:33.240 --> 18:37.472
* Together we will stand,
divided we'll fall *

18:37.510 --> 18:41.139
* Come on, now, people,
let's get on the ball... *

18:41.180 --> 18:42.738
All right!

18:42.780 --> 18:45.214
After all these years,

18:45.250 --> 18:48.754
planting cane
is still done by hand.

18:48.790 --> 18:51.918
We have 200 acres to cover.

18:51.960 --> 18:54.895
Now, y'all got
your marching orders.

18:54.930 --> 18:57.364
Let's get to work.

18:57.400 --> 18:59.220
Hey, you got any
spare shovels around,
Ralph Angel?

18:59.270 --> 19:01.488
- Yeah, in the shed.
- I'll grab them.

19:01.540 --> 19:04.532
Oh, Remy, no!
Man, it's locked up.

19:04.570 --> 19:05.764
I'ma get it myself.

19:05.810 --> 19:08.233
Don't worry about it.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.373
Go on.

19:10.410 --> 19:14.414
* Come on, come on,
let's work together *

19:14.450 --> 19:16.441
* Now, now, people

19:16.480 --> 19:18.914
* Say now together
we will stand *

19:18.950 --> 19:23.284
* Every boy, girl,
woman and man *

19:23.330 --> 19:25.685
* Oh, yeah

19:29.500 --> 19:31.821
* Oh, look it here,
look it here... *

19:31.870 --> 19:34.839
I don't remember that shed
having a lock on it.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.528
Pa never locked
nothing up.

19:39.570 --> 19:41.800
Now we got all this
new equipment around here,

19:41.840 --> 19:43.341
can't be too careful.

19:46.480 --> 19:49.745
You mind taking Blue
to school for me?

19:49.780 --> 19:51.839
Don't want him
to be late.

19:51.890 --> 19:54.688
- All right.
- * Make someone happy

19:54.720 --> 19:56.813
- * Make someone smile...
- Come on, boy, let's go.

19:56.860 --> 20:00.694
* Let's all work together
and make life worthwhile *

20:00.730 --> 20:03.494
* Let's work together

20:03.530 --> 20:07.466
* Come on, come on,
let's work together *

20:07.500 --> 20:09.297
* Now, now, people

20:09.340 --> 20:11.831
* Say now together
we will stand *

20:11.870 --> 20:16.330
* Every boy, girl,
woman and man *

20:19.010 --> 20:21.342
* Two or three minutes

20:21.380 --> 20:23.587
* Two or three hours

20:23.620 --> 20:25.713
* What do they mean,
now, now *

20:25.750 --> 20:28.583
- * In this life of ours?
- All right!

20:28.620 --> 20:30.429
Take lunch.
One hour.

20:31.660 --> 20:33.855
Bring them in!
Bring them in!

20:33.900 --> 20:35.856
( Ernest whistles,
speaking Spanish )

20:35.900 --> 20:37.595
Prosper:
Come on!

20:37.630 --> 20:39.495
Yeah, come on.

20:41.440 --> 20:42.759
You all right?

20:42.800 --> 20:45.030
Yeah.

20:45.070 --> 20:49.507
Wow. That is literally
backbreaking work.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.679
I feel guilty.

20:51.710 --> 20:53.940
Why?

20:53.980 --> 20:57.586
Well,
I'm leaving after lunch,
but I'll be back tomorrow.

20:59.720 --> 21:03.053
My husband
and son are coming in.

21:03.090 --> 21:04.955
I got to take care
of some personal business.

21:04.990 --> 21:09.927
Oh. Well, we'll have
plenty of work for you
to do when you get back.

21:11.670 --> 21:13.535
Truth be told, I didn't think
you'd be out here

21:13.570 --> 21:14.559
actually doing the work.

21:16.070 --> 21:17.765
Is that right?

21:17.810 --> 21:19.698
I know,
I guess I just assumed

21:19.740 --> 21:20.900
that you'd have
a housekeeper,

21:20.940 --> 21:24.569
nanny, gardeners,
a whole team of people

21:24.610 --> 21:26.805
doing everything for you.

21:29.020 --> 21:31.443
I guess I was wrong.

21:31.490 --> 21:32.912
Actually...

21:32.950 --> 21:35.657
I do have all those people.

21:35.690 --> 21:37.954
You just couldn't fit them
on the private jet?

21:37.990 --> 21:40.049
- Saving costs.
- Got it.

21:40.090 --> 21:42.627
( laughing )

21:45.630 --> 21:46.699
( sighs )

21:46.730 --> 21:48.664
Charley's ridiculous.

21:48.700 --> 21:50.531
She's getting worked up
about a couple
of shock jocks--

21:50.570 --> 21:52.936
Cut Charley some slack.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.801
blown up on T.V.
like that.

21:57.850 --> 21:58.999
For real.

22:02.980 --> 22:06.541
How's the warehouse job
going?

22:06.590 --> 22:09.457
It's a job on top of the job
I already have.

22:09.490 --> 22:11.685
It is what it is.

22:11.730 --> 22:13.550
How much you got left
on your parole?

22:13.600 --> 22:15.693
A little over a year.

22:15.730 --> 22:17.960
Your parole officer okay?

22:18.000 --> 22:19.763
He all right.

22:19.800 --> 22:22.337
For a guy who make me pee
in a cup once a week.

22:23.740 --> 22:27.608
Checking on this,
checking on that.

22:27.640 --> 22:31.474
You know I got to take
a parenting class to learn
how to parent Blue?

22:32.880 --> 22:34.848
All they got to do
is see me with him

22:34.880 --> 22:37.986
to know
I know what I'm doing.

22:38.020 --> 22:40.818
You're doing all right,
Ralph.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.589
I was thinking,

22:45.630 --> 22:48.599
maybe I could ask Charley
to fill out my paperwork.

22:48.630 --> 22:50.598
So I could do this
for parole.

22:50.630 --> 22:53.599
What you need
to ask Charley for?
I'll sign it for you.

22:53.640 --> 22:56.666
I got to get paid,
40 hours, her money.

22:56.700 --> 22:58.463
Well, when we sell,
you can pay her back
out of that.

22:58.510 --> 23:00.808
Will you stop talking
about selling, Nova?

23:02.640 --> 23:07.646
* Humble I fall

23:08.720 --> 23:12.417
* Humble I fall *

23:12.450 --> 23:14.953
* To my knees

23:14.990 --> 23:19.859
* Humble I fall.

23:22.100 --> 23:24.421
Hey, why don't you run inside
and tell your mom we're here,
all right?

23:24.470 --> 23:26.563
_ - Yeah.
- ( Violet screams )

23:26.600 --> 23:28.830
I am so glad you are back!

23:28.870 --> 23:30.633
What's up?

23:30.670 --> 23:32.069
Oh, baby,
we missed you.

23:32.110 --> 23:33.930
I missed you, too.

23:33.980 --> 23:36.505
Okay,
so I just picked up
some barbeque

23:36.540 --> 23:38.508
from the place
down the road.

23:38.550 --> 23:39.972
- Go on in there
and help yourself.
- Okay.

23:40.010 --> 23:42.513
The others will be in
from the field any minute.

23:42.550 --> 23:44.643
Hey, Vi, can you tell
Charley we're here, please?

23:44.690 --> 23:47.454
I said they're coming in
from the fields any minute.

23:47.490 --> 23:48.718
Charley?

23:48.760 --> 23:50.523
Yeah, isn't that her now?

23:50.560 --> 23:53.927
( laughing, talking )

23:53.960 --> 23:55.518
( Charley gasps )

23:55.560 --> 23:56.993
Hey!

23:57.030 --> 23:58.793
Wait, Mom.
Stop, stop, stop.
You're dirty.

23:58.830 --> 24:00.468
- You're dirty!
- Come on.

24:00.500 --> 24:01.933
A little dirt's good.
You don't wanna get dirty?

24:01.970 --> 24:03.938
_ - No!
Why not?

24:03.970 --> 24:05.904
- What you say, Micah?
Welcome back, baby.
- What's up?

24:07.780 --> 24:09.600
Mr. Newell.

24:09.640 --> 24:11.972
- Remy, Micah.
- Remy.

24:14.650 --> 24:16.538
Micah,
better come on in here

24:16.580 --> 24:17.581
and get some
of these hot links

24:17.620 --> 24:18.746
before they're all gone.

24:18.790 --> 24:19.779
Go on.

24:20.890 --> 24:24.553
Oh, Davis,
this is Remy Newell.

24:24.590 --> 24:26.820
Remy, this is Davis.

24:26.860 --> 24:29.658
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

24:34.300 --> 24:36.564
If y'all don't mind,
I'm gonna go in here

24:36.600 --> 24:38.704
and grab some
of these hot links
before they're gone.

24:38.740 --> 24:40.628
Yup.

24:40.680 --> 24:41.772
( chuckles )

24:44.610 --> 24:45.975
So, is he a local farmer?

24:46.010 --> 24:47.511
No.

24:47.550 --> 24:49.518
No, he is an engineer.

24:49.550 --> 24:52.587
And a professor.

24:52.620 --> 24:54.258
Well, I...

24:54.290 --> 24:55.917
didn't think
you would get this, um,

24:55.960 --> 24:58.520
into farming.

24:58.560 --> 25:00.551
I've never seen you
water a houseplant.

25:03.830 --> 25:06.719
Let's get some lunch,
Davis.

25:06.770 --> 25:08.761
(faint talking )

25:15.780 --> 25:17.645
Davis.

25:17.680 --> 25:20.240
I'll wash up
and you can leave.

25:23.050 --> 25:25.018
Ralph Angel:
I'll see you out there,
Mr. Prosper.

25:25.050 --> 25:27.757
Prosper:
You're doing good, son,
you're doing good.

25:27.790 --> 25:30.679
Hey, uh.

25:30.730 --> 25:32.618
Micah showed me
your article.

25:32.660 --> 25:36.949
Yeah. It's good.
I can really relate,
you know?

25:37.000 --> 25:39.628
I've seen how the system
treats black men.

25:39.670 --> 25:43.333
Especially after living
through this witch hunt,
you know what I'm saying?

25:43.370 --> 25:46.533
When you're a black man
accused of something,
you must have done it.

25:50.340 --> 25:52.979
How'd you and Micah
get here, Davis?

25:53.010 --> 25:55.717
- We flew.
- Which airline?

25:55.750 --> 25:59.345
- Private.
-Hmm.

25:59.390 --> 26:01.711
We have a jet share program
with a few other players.

26:01.760 --> 26:03.580
But I had to, you know?

26:03.630 --> 26:05.586
So many paparazzi on me.

26:05.630 --> 26:07.325
Yeah.

26:07.360 --> 26:08.952
That's what I thought.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.662
Yeah.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.793
So, you flew private.

26:13.840 --> 26:14.989
You have a driver

26:15.040 --> 26:17.338
waiting to take you
back to Houston.

26:17.370 --> 26:22.376
Probably staying
in some fancy hotel
in the city.

26:22.410 --> 26:24.605
And you're paying millions
of dollars to pay off
your accuser

26:24.650 --> 26:26.641
so that you don't
have to stand trial.

26:29.280 --> 26:31.942
And you're sitting here
comparing yourself
to a 17-year-old kid

26:31.990 --> 26:34.015
without so much
as a public defender

26:34.060 --> 26:35.857
because you're both black.

26:39.730 --> 26:41.254
Listen,

26:41.300 --> 26:44.690
I don't know what lies
you have to tell yourself,

26:44.730 --> 26:46.664
to get up each morning,

26:48.740 --> 26:51.334
but let me point out
the most obvious one.

26:53.070 --> 26:56.233
The system doesn't treat
all black men alike.

26:56.280 --> 26:58.771
But you're so narcissistic

26:58.810 --> 27:01.643
that you don't even recognize
what your privilege buys you.

28:04.350 --> 28:07.001
( dialing )

28:08.220 --> 28:09.847
( phone rings )

28:09.880 --> 28:11.780
Man:
St. Josephine's
Loan and Trust Bank.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.310
How may I help you?

28:13.350 --> 28:15.989
Yes, I'd like to wire
some money from my account?

28:16.020 --> 28:18.921
And what's the name
on that account?

28:18.960 --> 28:22.350
Yes, I'm Nova Bordelon
on the Bordelon Farm Account.

28:22.400 --> 28:25.392
All right,
just give me one moment.

28:25.430 --> 28:26.829
And what's the amount?

28:26.870 --> 28:29.737
Yes,
I'd like to wire $10,000

28:29.770 --> 28:31.829
to All Out Bail Bonds.

28:39.880 --> 28:41.745
So, I see you switched up
your shifts, huh?

28:41.780 --> 28:44.487
Working nights now?

28:44.520 --> 28:46.841
All the better for me.

28:49.060 --> 28:52.951
Look, I got something
for you to take with you
when you leave, hear?

28:52.990 --> 28:54.298
Or I could stop by
and see that farm.

28:54.330 --> 28:56.457
Drop off a few boxes.

28:58.530 --> 29:01.829
I said
that's not gonna work.

29:01.870 --> 29:04.100
I said I'm coming by.

29:04.140 --> 29:05.505
What the hell's
wrong with you, young blood?

29:05.540 --> 29:07.838
You better watch yourself
before you hurt yourself.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.939
I ain't doing this
no more.

29:12.310 --> 29:14.312
Come on!

29:14.350 --> 29:15.317
( groans )

29:15.350 --> 29:17.910
Yeah, stand him up!

29:17.950 --> 29:19.941
- Get off me! Get off me!
- Get him up!

29:25.160 --> 29:27.128
( groans )

29:27.160 --> 29:29.299
What the hell
is going on here?

29:31.200 --> 29:33.020
Melvin?

29:35.040 --> 29:38.339
You're lucky those
weren't cell phones.
You'd both be fired.

29:38.370 --> 29:44.149
Now cut the crap
and get back to work.

29:44.180 --> 29:45.545
I can't work
with this dude no more.

29:45.580 --> 29:48.413
I can't.
I ain't doing this no more.

29:48.450 --> 29:51.010
Get back to work,
Ralph Angel,

29:51.050 --> 29:52.312
or you'll be looking
for a new job.

29:52.350 --> 29:55.217
- I'm fine with that.
- What'd you say?

29:55.260 --> 29:57.285
- I'm fine with that.
- You wanna get fired?

29:57.320 --> 29:58.548
No.

29:58.590 --> 30:00.785
I want you to lay me off.

30:02.360 --> 30:05.568
You're fired.

30:05.600 --> 30:09.331
And I'll make sure
your parole officer
is well aware of it.

30:13.610 --> 30:16.431
Yeah, I'll talk to him.

30:16.480 --> 30:20.007
'Cause I think he'd be
interested in seeing how
my check showed every week.

30:22.220 --> 30:26.111
His math might be better
than mine, sir.

30:27.250 --> 30:29.457
Now, lay me off,

30:29.490 --> 30:32.084
and no one got to know.

30:33.390 --> 30:36.097
Get your shit and get out.

30:36.130 --> 30:37.529
* The clay I woke up
was this one *

30:37.560 --> 30:39.323
Will do.

30:39.370 --> 30:41.463
* I can't sit and play
the victim *

30:41.500 --> 30:44.469
* My day's looking better,
my day's looking better...*

30:44.510 --> 30:46.137
You want cucumbers
or carrots?

30:46.170 --> 30:48.434
- Carrots!
- ( knocking at door)

30:55.420 --> 30:59.242
Man:
Are you Ralph Angel Bordelon?

30:59.290 --> 31:01.417
Yes, sir.

31:01.460 --> 31:04.281
We have a warrant
to search your property.

31:07.030 --> 31:09.089
T & K Warehouse,
where you're employed,

31:09.130 --> 31:11.394
has asked to have all
they're employer re5idences
searched

31:11.430 --> 31:13.421
for stolen merchandise.

31:26.610 --> 31:30.239
- What's going on, Pops?
- They're just looking around.

31:30.280 --> 31:33.443
When Aunt Vi answers,
tell her to come out here
right away, okay?

31:33.490 --> 31:35.515
- Okay. Yes.
- You heard me? All right.

31:35.560 --> 31:38.529
Stay in your room.
Don't come out.

31:38.560 --> 31:39.584
Go on.

31:42.630 --> 31:44.461
( clears throat )

32:11.260 --> 32:13.524
Got a key to the shed?

32:20.070 --> 32:22.061
Let's go.

32:40.750 --> 32:43.014
Go on.

32:45.430 --> 32:47.386
Open it.

32:53.100 --> 32:54.431
Step back.

32:55.700 --> 32:58.009
Step. Back.

33:34.840 --> 33:36.569
Okay.

33:37.840 --> 33:40.070
It's clear.

33:41.550 --> 33:44.383
Sorry to have bothered you.

33:44.420 --> 33:46.479
Have a good night.

34:15.180 --> 34:17.444
Aunt Vi.

34:28.730 --> 34:32.826
* I move

34:32.870 --> 34:36.237
* Heaw stones

34:40.610 --> 34:45.707
* I don't want to be
way down... *

34:45.750 --> 34:49.208
Blue says the police
were out here looking
for something.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.613
They ain't find nothing,
did they?

34:59.790 --> 35:02.224
No, they didn't.

35:04.570 --> 35:08.893
* Faith is the only thing
I need to hold on to *

35:08.940 --> 35:12.205
Well, they're not gonna.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.731
It's at the bottom
of the bayou.

35:14.780 --> 35:17.738
* Faith is the only thing
I need *

35:17.780 --> 35:22.217
* To hold on to...

35:22.250 --> 35:24.787
I'm sorry, Aunt Vi.

35:29.820 --> 35:34.655
* Need to hold

35:34.700 --> 35:39.660
* Hold on to

35:39.700 --> 35:41.565
I'm trying.

35:43.270 --> 35:46.239
* Faith is the only thing
I need *

35:46.270 --> 35:52.277
* To hold on to

35:55.280 --> 35:57.419
This is the standard
non-disclosure agreement.

35:57.450 --> 35:58.917
It states _
that you Will not discuss

35:58.950 --> 36:00.508
the night in question,

36:00.550 --> 36:02.256
what is discussed today,
or the dollar amount

36:02.290 --> 36:03.951
given to Milena Galoudian.

36:03.990 --> 36:05.821
Understood.

36:08.330 --> 36:10.298
Give her the check.

36:12.770 --> 36:16.262
For $3 million
this had better go away.

36:16.300 --> 36:19.428
It will.
But she's holding off
on signing her paperwork

36:19.470 --> 36:21.574
until after you apologize.

36:21.610 --> 36:23.737
So, make it sincere.

36:27.350 --> 36:29.272
When is she meeting
with the other players?

36:29.320 --> 36:30.446
She's not.

36:32.450 --> 36:33.678
Why?

36:33.720 --> 36:36.416
She only wanted
to meet with Davis.

36:36.460 --> 36:38.428
She may have already
gotten a payoff from them.

36:38.460 --> 36:39.859
But that is also
conﬁdenﬁaL

36:39.890 --> 36:41.721
so I have no idea.

36:46.770 --> 36:48.692
You ready?

36:48.740 --> 36:51.300
( sighs )

36:51.340 --> 36:53.399
Can you give us a minute?

37:05.490 --> 37:08.254
Listen,

37:08.290 --> 37:10.349
I don't know What
she's gonna say in there.

37:10.390 --> 37:13.359
I have no control
over that.

37:13.390 --> 37:15.620
But know this, Charley.

37:15.660 --> 37:17.628
I did not rape her.

37:20.700 --> 37:22.668
I know that, Davis.

37:25.040 --> 37:27.406
Or I wouldn't be standing
next to you right now.

37:30.710 --> 37:35.511
* Why do we build this castle
in the slq? *

37:37.420 --> 37:39.479
* All these
marvel clouds *

37:39.520 --> 37:44.014
* Imagine them
when I'm high *

37:44.060 --> 37:47.518
* Perfect isn't wise

37:47.560 --> 37:50.051
* When I feel the cloud

37:50.100 --> 37:54.366
_ * And the child
is Singing loud... *

37:54.400 --> 37:56.061
Woman:
Good morning, everyone.

37:56.100 --> 37:58.432
Miss Galoudian
will read her statement

37:58.470 --> 38:01.678
and then Mr. West
will have a chance
to respond.

38:08.110 --> 38:13.412
I have known you,
Davis West,

38:13.450 --> 38:17.056
for little over
three years.

38:17.090 --> 38:19.422
Over those years,

38:19.460 --> 38:23.328
we have developed
what felt like
a relationship,

38:23.360 --> 38:26.295
if not a friendship.

38:28.740 --> 38:32.062
I trusted you.

38:32.110 --> 38:34.476
That's why
I couldn't believe

38:34.510 --> 38:37.536
you would do
what you did.

38:37.580 --> 38:39.445
That night,

38:39.480 --> 38:42.449
when we went back up
to the room to party
with the team,

38:42.480 --> 38:45.085
you got that call
about Micah.

38:45.120 --> 38:47.816
He had an asthma attack,

38:47.850 --> 38:49.750
so you decided
to go back home.

38:49.790 --> 38:52.088
So, you gave me
some extra cash

38:52.130 --> 38:54.496
and you left.

39:01.600 --> 39:05.730
When I got
out of the shower,

39:05.770 --> 39:08.136
Felix and Eddie

39:08.170 --> 39:10.604
were waiting for me.

39:10.640 --> 39:13.143
Their girls from the agency
hadn't shown,

39:13.180 --> 39:16.479
but they said
you told them

39:16.520 --> 39:20.012
that they can
have a go with me.

39:20.050 --> 39:24.384
I told them that you
would never agree to that.

39:24.430 --> 39:26.785
That I was your girl.

39:29.160 --> 39:32.493
But they kept saying
that you paid.

39:34.030 --> 39:37.466
And then...

39:37.500 --> 39:39.764
and then they raped me.

39:43.580 --> 39:47.038
More guys from the team
joined in.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.513
They took turns--

39:48.550 --> 39:51.519
Look, Milena...

39:51.550 --> 39:53.780
I never told them
they could do that to you.

39:53.820 --> 39:58.018
I didn't tell
them that, honestly.

39:58.060 --> 40:01.757
How can you
look me in the eyes
and say that,

40:01.800 --> 40:04.564
after What
you said to me?

40:08.740 --> 40:09.889
When I came forward,

40:09.940 --> 40:14.104
and accused the guys
of raping me...

40:16.710 --> 40:18.075
I knew you'd call.

40:20.880 --> 40:23.542
( phone clicks, beeps )

40:23.580 --> 40:24.683
Davis on phone:
Baby,

40:24.720 --> 40:26.210
hey, why are you
doing this?

40:26.250 --> 40:28.957
Milena:
Did you tell
Felix and Eddie

40:28.990 --> 40:30.218
they could do that to me?

40:30.260 --> 40:31.955
Davis:
Do what?

40:31.990 --> 40:33.787
You got paid,
didn't you?

40:33.830 --> 40:36.719
Milena:
They raped me, Davis.

40:36.760 --> 40:38.967
Davis:
Come on, come on.
Milena...

40:39.000 --> 40:40.661
Look you started out
with gangbangs,

40:40.700 --> 40:43.464
and now you got
a problem with it?

40:43.500 --> 40:44.865
I mean, look...

40:44.910 --> 40:46.707
you should have
called me ﬁrst

40:46.740 --> 40:48.230
before you
opened your mouth.

40:48.270 --> 40:50.135
( Milena sobs )

40:50.180 --> 40:51.807
Ithought
I meant more to you--

40:51.850 --> 40:53.477
Davis:
Hold on, hold on.

40:53.510 --> 40:56.240
Milena, Milena, look.
You know what it is.

40:56.280 --> 40:58.487
Okay, I can bang
any bitch on the road.

40:58.520 --> 40:59.942
You understand me?
Any bitch.

40:59.990 --> 41:02.151
Okay, I pay you
to keep your mouth shut.

41:02.190 --> 41:04.624
That's what
I pay you for,

41:04.660 --> 41:05.854
unless I put
something in it,

41:05.890 --> 41:07.755
I pay you
to keep your mouth shut.

41:07.790 --> 41:10.156
I pay you to do shit
my wife won't do,
you understand?

41:10.200 --> 41:11.690
That's it.

41:11.730 --> 41:13.789
Now, stop coming after me
and my family.

41:17.640 --> 41:18.937
( phone clicks, beeps )

41:28.550 --> 41:30.814
- Milena, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, too.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.787
Truly.

41:48.840 --> 41:51.900

41:53.910 --> 41:57.778

41:57.810 --> 42:00.802
You're a monster, Davis.

Okay...

42:03.120 --> 42:06.283
_ You turned me
into a monster, too.

42:06.320 --> 42:09.881
- Listen--

42:09.920 --> 42:11.626
