17:30.551 --> 17:32.636
[chuckles] But that was a long time ago.

17:33.428 --> 17:35.764
Now they can't seem to stay away.

17:35.848 --> 17:38.684
At night, they post up where
the last of us still live,

17:38.767 --> 17:41.520
a police car on either side of the block.

17:41.603 --> 17:43.230
Keeping us safe…

17:44.690 --> 17:46.149
or keeping us in.

17:47.442 --> 17:49.361
You've lived around here for a while?

17:50.362 --> 17:53.073
Uh, since before the high-rises came down.

17:53.156 --> 17:55.158
William. William Burke.

17:55.242 --> 17:56.535
Anthony McCoy.

17:56.618 --> 17:58.036
[clicks fingers]

17:59.788 --> 18:00.789
You need a hand?

18:02.833 --> 18:04.251
[William] Home sweet home.

18:06.086 --> 18:09.464
Ah, the more things change,
the more things stay the same.

18:09.548 --> 18:11.049
How you doing, brother?

18:11.133 --> 18:14.803
Ask the white people around here
about "Girl X," Dantrell Davis.

18:14.887 --> 18:16.013
Blank stares.

18:16.096 --> 18:19.725
One white woman dies in the hood,
and the story lives on forever.

18:19.808 --> 18:21.518
It's a good story, I guess.

18:21.602 --> 18:23.687
You mind if I take some notes?

18:24.313 --> 18:25.314
[pen clicks]

18:27.816 --> 18:31.111
Makes you think about what could make
someone just snap like that.

18:31.195 --> 18:33.947
Helen Lyle was out here
looking for Candyman.

18:34.031 --> 18:36.533
You ask me, I say she found him.

18:38.619 --> 18:39.953
What's Candyman?

18:42.122 --> 18:45.876
[William] For me, Candyman
was a guy named Sherman Fields.

18:45.959 --> 18:48.337
He had a hook for a hand.

18:48.420 --> 18:49.421
Neighborhood character.

18:49.505 --> 18:52.508
Used to stand there
and hand out sweets when I was a kid.

18:53.592 --> 18:54.593
One October,

18:55.302 --> 18:58.847
a razor blade shows up
in a little white girl's Halloween candy.

18:58.931 --> 19:02.017
Police come around looking for Sherman,
but Sherman's gone.

19:03.435 --> 19:07.231
And one day, I saw him myself.

19:07.940 --> 19:09.525
[heartbeat thumping]

19:10.484 --> 19:11.944
[Candyman humming]

19:17.866 --> 19:19.451
[William] He'd been hiding in the walls.

19:19.535 --> 19:20.702
[screaming]

19:22.162 --> 19:23.455
[screaming continues]

19:26.667 --> 19:28.377
We got a suspicious noise…

19:29.461 --> 19:31.922
That's when I saw the true face of fear.

19:32.005 --> 19:33.507
[footsteps approaching]

19:34.341 --> 19:36.760
[policeman, muffled] Come on, come on.
Go, go, go!

19:36.844 --> 19:38.470
Go, go! Come on, let's go!

19:38.554 --> 19:41.473
[shouting fades]

20:00.284 --> 20:01.618
[muffled shouting]

20:01.702 --> 20:03.370
Hurry! Come on, go, go, go!

20:03.453 --> 20:04.955
[footsteps approaching]

20:18.010 --> 20:19.011
Over here.

20:19.094 --> 20:21.555
Get out of here! Come on!

20:21.638 --> 20:22.973
[indistinct shouting]

20:27.811 --> 20:29.229
[William] They swarmed him.

20:29.313 --> 20:30.647
[policemen shouting]

20:34.735 --> 20:36.069
[door shuts]

20:36.153 --> 20:38.238
Killed him right there on the spot.

20:38.322 --> 20:39.615
[bees buzzing]

20:41.491 --> 20:43.577
-[gunshot]
-[screaming]

20:48.874 --> 20:50.959
What shows up a couple weeks later?

20:52.211 --> 20:54.755
More razor blades in more candy.

20:56.298 --> 20:59.551
That's when we knew
Sherman had been innocent.

20:59.635 --> 21:01.053
Harmless.

21:02.763 --> 21:04.806
But that wasn't the last we saw of him.

21:16.568 --> 21:17.569
[knuckles crack]

21:58.819 --> 22:00.487
I don't know what to tell you.

22:00.571 --> 22:02.447
Beshaw dropped out of my show.

22:03.657 --> 22:07.119
Oh, I told you months ago
to put her in rehab.

22:08.120 --> 22:09.705
You fix this.

22:10.247 --> 22:11.748
[speaking in French]

22:16.378 --> 22:17.504
Uh.

22:18.172 --> 22:19.715
[continues speaking in French]

22:19.798 --> 22:20.799
Uh-huh.

22:21.341 --> 22:22.509
Uh-huh. Okay.

22:22.593 --> 22:23.677
[speaks in French]

22:24.970 --> 22:26.054
What's up?

22:27.055 --> 22:30.267
-You forgot your mother's.
-Shit. I'm sorry.

22:30.350 --> 22:32.269
Will you please call that woman?

22:32.352 --> 22:34.354
-Tomorrow.
-You said that yesterday.

22:34.438 --> 22:36.356
And it's nice that she wants
to spend time with you.

22:36.440 --> 22:37.816
Not everyone has that.

22:39.359 --> 22:40.861
Is she okay?

22:40.944 --> 22:44.198
She implied that I give you money
so you won't visit her.

22:45.365 --> 22:47.618
So, she's about the same.

22:47.701 --> 22:49.828
-[sighs] Stop it.
-[laughs] That's great.

22:49.912 --> 22:51.330
I wanna show you something.

22:52.122 --> 22:53.332
Uh…

22:54.249 --> 22:57.002
-Do I need to come upstairs?
-Stay right there.

22:57.085 --> 22:59.046
All righty then.

22:59.129 --> 23:03.342
[Anthony] Sherman's face was beaten
so badly that it was unrecognizable,

23:03.425 --> 23:06.011
and that's where the story started.

23:06.094 --> 23:09.014
About them seeing him around Cabrini.

23:09.097 --> 23:10.933
About him coming to get you.

23:11.600 --> 23:16.772
Over time, his name disappears,
and he just becomes the Candyman.

23:18.232 --> 23:19.483
What do you think?

23:19.566 --> 23:21.109
Well…

23:21.193 --> 23:22.945
it's a pretty literal approach.

23:23.779 --> 23:26.198
Not much room for viewer
interpretation, you know.

23:26.281 --> 23:30.035
Moving from the symbolism of violence
to the actual depiction of it.

23:30.118 --> 23:32.996
Okay, but how is it hitting you?

23:33.080 --> 23:34.498
It's…

23:35.415 --> 23:36.917
painful.

23:37.584 --> 23:41.046
I feel really connected to this.
I've never been this clear before.

23:42.464 --> 23:45.676
It's like I know exactly
what I'm meant to be doing right now.

23:46.927 --> 23:50.013
Babe, that's great.

23:52.099 --> 23:55.894
-And I'm sure Clive will be--
-Oh, there's one more thing.

23:56.728 --> 24:00.107
The legend is
if you say his name five times

24:00.190 --> 24:01.650
while looking in the mirror,

24:02.359 --> 24:05.571
he appears in the reflection
and kills you.

24:06.822 --> 24:09.449
So, I thought

24:09.533 --> 24:11.827
that we could…

24:11.910 --> 24:13.412
[laughs] What did you think?

24:13.495 --> 24:15.289
[whispering] Summon him.

24:15.372 --> 24:16.790
[scoffs]

24:16.874 --> 24:18.166
Hell no.

24:19.418 --> 24:20.794
No.

24:20.878 --> 24:22.337
Candyman.

24:22.421 --> 24:23.672
Anthony…

24:23.755 --> 24:26.508
-Candyman.
-Anthony, no.

24:26.592 --> 24:28.760
-Candyman.
-Stop. Stop it.

24:28.844 --> 24:30.387
-Candyman.
-Stop it!

24:30.470 --> 24:31.597
Okay.

24:31.680 --> 24:34.057
-You better not do that last one.
-Okay, okay, okay.

24:37.019 --> 24:40.147
-[whispers] Candyman.
-Anthony, you play too much!

24:40.230 --> 24:41.565
Stop, stop, stop.

24:41.648 --> 24:43.442
What happened to your hand?

24:43.525 --> 24:45.777
-Fucking bee sting.
-Really?

24:45.861 --> 24:47.279
Yeah, that shit hurt.

24:47.362 --> 24:49.615
Mmm. Looks like it.

24:49.698 --> 24:51.867
-Kiss it.
-Get the fuck outta here.

24:52.743 --> 24:54.453
Help, help.

25:22.481 --> 25:24.024
[crowd chattering]

26:27.754 --> 26:29.214
[camera clicking]

26:29.840 --> 26:32.176
-We can go now.
-Finally.

26:34.303 --> 26:38.307
Last year, we did a solo booth
at Frieze LA with Jameson.

26:38.390 --> 26:39.725
Phenomenal work.

26:39.808 --> 26:41.018
These are related works,

26:41.101 --> 26:46.231
but here, he's recreating
and looping archival footage.

26:47.858 --> 26:49.443
[Bri] Just take your time.

26:58.368 --> 27:00.746
This is quite a departure
from your previous work.

27:02.915 --> 27:04.166
Go ahead, open it.

27:12.299 --> 27:16.470
I'm trying to align these moments in time
that exist in the same place.

27:17.513 --> 27:19.223
The idea is to almost

27:19.306 --> 27:23.769
calibrate tragedy into a focused lineage
that culminates in the now.

27:24.770 --> 27:28.106
Brianna,
tell your boy not to hog the critic.

27:29.900 --> 27:31.944
He's got a whole thing.

27:32.027 --> 27:36.573
Yeah, no, I know, I heard it.
It's complicated.

27:36.657 --> 27:40.410
She's interacting with the piece.

27:40.494 --> 27:43.914
[Anthony] The mirror invites you
to attempt the summoning yourself.

27:45.582 --> 27:46.583
Huh.

27:48.961 --> 27:51.713
Anyway, I don't know why
I'm standing next to my own piece

27:51.797 --> 27:53.674
like some kind of asshole.

27:53.757 --> 27:57.928
-The work speaks for itself.
-Oh, it speaks, all right.

27:58.971 --> 28:01.431
It speaks in didactic knee-jerk clichés

28:01.515 --> 28:04.852
about the ambient violence
of the gentrification cycle.

28:05.561 --> 28:09.731
But your kind are the real pioneers
of that cycle, you know.

28:09.815 --> 28:11.149
Excuse me?

28:12.401 --> 28:13.527
Artists.

28:15.445 --> 28:18.323
Artists descend upon
disenfranchised neighborhoods

28:18.407 --> 28:21.201
divining cheap rent, so they can
dick around in their studios

28:21.285 --> 28:23.662
without the crushing burden of a day job.

28:25.581 --> 28:27.082
I'm gonna get another drink.

28:36.008 --> 28:38.135
-Should we try it?
-What?

28:38.218 --> 28:39.803
Summon the Candyman?

28:39.887 --> 28:43.140
Uh, yeah, no. Black people don't need
to be summoning shit.

28:43.223 --> 28:46.226
-Come on, that is nonsense.
-This isn't the bayou.

28:46.310 --> 28:48.187
In Chicago, that's white people shit.

28:48.270 --> 28:49.563
Mmm.

28:49.646 --> 28:52.900
-Candyman. Candyman.
-Zip it. Hey, stop.

28:58.655 --> 28:59.865
-Candyman.
-Stop it.

29:05.204 --> 29:07.372
[man] Of course, I did. I owe Brianna one.

29:07.456 --> 29:10.667
She introduced me to Thelma Golden
three years ago.

29:10.751 --> 29:13.212
-[Brianna] You still owe me one for that.
-[laughs]

29:13.295 --> 29:14.588
And, uh…

29:14.671 --> 29:15.881
Ah… [snaps fingers]

29:15.964 --> 29:17.382
Tony, is it?

29:17.466 --> 29:20.219
I love interventionist strategy.

29:20.302 --> 29:23.305
Conventional painting is such a drag.

29:23.388 --> 29:25.057
I love that you hid those fucking things

29:25.140 --> 29:27.351
in a storage room
with the lights out. So smart.

29:27.434 --> 29:29.603
Is all your work based on found material?

29:29.686 --> 29:31.647
I mean, where'd you
even find those paintings?

29:31.730 --> 29:33.023
Thrift store in the desert?

29:33.106 --> 29:34.525
[laughing]

29:34.608 --> 29:37.528
I found them in the studio
where I painted them.

29:37.611 --> 29:38.737
[laughing]

29:38.820 --> 29:40.572
You goofy-ass fuck.

29:41.990 --> 29:44.243
And you, you fucking hyenas.

29:44.326 --> 29:46.453
-Oh, what the fuck?
-Hey. Let's go. Clive.

29:48.121 --> 29:49.915
-Anthony.
-You think you'd even be here

29:49.998 --> 29:51.083
if it wasn't for her?

29:51.166 --> 29:53.168
Shouldn't you be stocking up
on morning-after pills

29:53.252 --> 29:55.045
to accommodate your summer intern program?

29:55.128 --> 29:57.923
That's not spontaneous.
You had that one in the bank.

29:58.006 --> 29:59.675
Yeah, I did, bitch.

29:59.758 --> 30:00.926
[grunts]

30:01.677 --> 30:04.137
That's fine.
I can take being called a bitch.

30:04.847 --> 30:07.516
-It's fine. I'm on a NuvaRing.
-[stammering] I know.

30:09.142 --> 30:10.435
Thanks for coming.

30:36.461 --> 30:38.547
I'm so fucking over it.

30:38.630 --> 30:41.216
Honestly, if she can't control her man…

30:41.300 --> 30:42.593
[woman] She lost control.

30:42.676 --> 30:45.387
It's like, do I get a thank you? No!

30:45.470 --> 30:48.307
Do I get an apology for that display?

30:48.390 --> 30:50.267
Atrocity exhibition.

30:51.101 --> 30:55.772
[Clive] Shoehorning her boyfriend
into my summer show was her first mistake.

30:55.856 --> 30:57.941
-Only mistake.
-[sighs] She's done.

30:58.025 --> 31:00.152
And she has no one to blame but herself.

31:00.235 --> 31:03.071
Don't mix curation
with who you're fucking.

31:03.155 --> 31:04.281
[woman laughs]

31:04.364 --> 31:05.782
Love will tear us apart.

31:05.866 --> 31:08.327
Jesus, Jerrica, we get it.
You like Joy Division.

31:08.410 --> 31:09.912
-[Jerrica laughs]
-[Clive sighs]

31:14.416 --> 31:17.002
-What's that thing again?
-[sighs] What thing?

31:18.545 --> 31:19.546
You know.

31:20.672 --> 31:22.716
Say what five times in the mirror?

31:22.799 --> 31:24.968
[sighs] You tell me.

31:25.052 --> 31:27.387
You proofread the press release, Jerrica.

31:28.514 --> 31:29.681
[Clive] "Candyman."

31:30.974 --> 31:34.269
But don't do it, okay?

31:35.187 --> 31:36.939
I don't want you to die tonight.

31:38.440 --> 31:40.651
At least, not until we…

31:41.401 --> 31:42.444
fuck.

31:44.363 --> 31:45.614
You're no good for me.

31:45.697 --> 31:47.950
You know what? I changed my mind. Do it.

31:48.033 --> 31:49.826
Necrophilia's always been
on my bucket list.

31:49.910 --> 31:51.078
Mmm.

31:53.413 --> 31:55.040
-[shoes clatter]
-[Clive] Mmm.

31:56.583 --> 31:57.668
Hmm.

31:57.751 --> 31:59.044
Let's do it here then.

31:59.670 --> 32:00.712
Um.

32:00.796 --> 32:03.298
-No, I've been here all day.
-Come on.

32:05.050 --> 32:06.385
[rain pattering]

32:10.973 --> 32:12.683
-[Clive] Mmm.
-[giggles]

32:13.892 --> 32:16.937
-[Jerrica] Candyman.
-Are you serious?

32:17.020 --> 32:18.188
Quiet, bitch.

32:26.029 --> 32:27.489
-Candyman.
-[Clive groans]

32:28.156 --> 32:29.658
Candyman.

32:29.741 --> 32:31.243
[bee buzzing]

32:32.494 --> 32:34.288
-Candyman.
-Mmm.

32:34.371 --> 32:35.706
Candyman.

32:53.223 --> 32:54.308
[Jerrica] See?

32:54.391 --> 32:55.976
Nothing.

32:56.059 --> 32:57.811
So much for that.

32:58.437 --> 32:59.605
[kisses]

33:00.189 --> 33:01.690

[Clive grunts]

33:05.777 --> 33:06.862
[blood splattering]

33:06.945 --> 33:07.946
[Clive] Is this real?

33:09.948 --> 33:11.742
This is real?

33:11.825 --> 33:13.118
What the fuck?

33:15.078 --> 33:16.788
-[gurgling]
-What the fuck!

33:16.872 --> 33:18.373
[bee buzzing]

33:22.753 --> 33:24.004
[Clive] Hello?

33:26.715 --> 33:28.175
[raspy breathing]

33:31.178 --> 33:32.471
[buzzing continues]

33:34.848 --> 33:36.141
-What…
-[whirring]

33:41.772 --> 33:45.651
-…the fuck?
-[whirring stops]

33:46.485 --> 33:47.611
[Clive hyperventilates]

33:47.694 --> 33:49.112
[raspy breathing]

33:52.533 --> 33:53.909
Oh!

33:53.992 --> 33:55.452
Fuck!

33:56.161 --> 33:59.206
Fuck me. Must go faster.

33:59.289 --> 34:01.333
-Must go faster!
-[buzzing intensifies]

34:08.799 --> 34:09.800
Fuck!

34:10.967 --> 34:12.302
-Fuck! No!
-[blood splatters]

34:14.096 --> 34:15.389
No! No!

34:17.766 --> 34:19.643
Stop! Stop! Stop!

34:20.561 --> 34:22.603
Help! No! No!

34:23.856 --> 34:25.107
[screaming]

34:26.233 --> 34:27.234
[grunts]

35:03.228 --> 35:04.605
[breathing heavily]

35:06.064 --> 35:07.858
Fucking assholes.

35:29.254 --> 35:30.422
[bees buzzing]

35:33.634 --> 35:38.013
The murders occurred after
Night Driver Gallery's group show opening.

35:38.096 --> 35:40.390
The bodies were discovered
in front of a piece

35:40.474 --> 35:44.102
from rising star Anthony McCoy
entitled Say My Name.

35:44.186 --> 35:47.105
Law enforcement officers
say they are investigating--

35:47.189 --> 35:48.232
[TV clicks off]

35:52.486 --> 35:53.820
Say My Name.

35:56.907 --> 35:58.325
They said my name.

35:58.408 --> 35:59.576
[chuckles]

36:00.369 --> 36:01.745
And Say My Name.

36:06.875 --> 36:08.001
I don't know, just…

36:09.253 --> 36:11.129
It's cool to be mentioned, I guess.

36:15.509 --> 36:17.094
I mean, obviously…

36:18.053 --> 36:20.180
Obviously, it's-- Obviously, it's awful.

36:21.056 --> 36:22.057
[Troy] Really?

36:28.230 --> 36:29.523
[rain pattering]

36:33.485 --> 36:34.778
[bees buzzing]

36:35.946 --> 36:37.030
[insects chirping]

36:40.450 --> 36:42.035
Clive?

36:43.871 --> 36:44.997
[bees buzzing]

36:45.998 --> 36:47.249
[girl] Dad?

36:51.920 --> 36:54.006
Why are you sitting there?

36:57.301 --> 36:58.468
Hey.

37:00.596 --> 37:03.473
I bet you didn't know
your daddy could fly.

37:04.516 --> 37:05.517
Did you?

37:08.604 --> 37:09.813
Well, I can.

37:09.897 --> 37:11.148
[bees buzzing]

37:12.774 --> 37:14.026
[Brianna screams]

37:23.619 --> 37:24.912
[heavy breathing]

37:25.787 --> 37:27.247
[rain pattering]

37:29.416 --> 37:30.792
[raspy breathing]

37:31.960 --> 37:33.378
[gasps]

37:40.427 --> 37:41.512
Anthony?

37:51.730 --> 37:52.981
Anthony?

37:55.651 --> 37:56.860
Are you okay?

37:58.695 --> 38:00.572
I had a bad dream.

38:01.365 --> 38:02.449
Me too.

38:04.034 --> 38:05.118
What was it?

38:06.828 --> 38:07.913
What was what?

38:09.331 --> 38:10.374
The dream.

38:15.295 --> 38:17.548
I'll be out. I'll be out in a minute.

38:21.718 --> 38:22.845
Anthony?

38:26.473 --> 38:31.478
So, I don't know what this is,
or how you knew it existed,

38:31.562 --> 38:33.939
but this is everything
we have under Helen Lyle.

38:34.022 --> 38:36.650
I didn't. That's why I had to ask.

38:39.027 --> 38:40.863
Well, here it is.

38:40.946 --> 38:42.447
Thanks, I appreciate it.

38:42.531 --> 38:45.158
Of course.
I found it filed under True Crimes.

38:45.242 --> 38:47.369
Work-study undergrads are the worst.

38:47.452 --> 38:48.954
So, are you a student?

38:51.081 --> 38:52.291
[tape recorder clicks]

38:52.374 --> 38:55.794
[woman] Some of the things that
have happened in Cabrini over the years,

38:55.878 --> 38:59.798
violence just so extreme, so bizarre.

38:59.882 --> 39:03.969
It's almost as if violence
became a ritual.

39:04.052 --> 39:05.345
The worst part,

39:06.013 --> 39:08.182
the residents are afraid
to call the police.

39:08.265 --> 39:12.102
A code of honor, perhaps,
fear of the police themselves.

39:12.186 --> 39:15.105
The easy answer is always,
"Candyman did it."

39:15.189 --> 39:17.691
The summoning game itself
could be connected.

39:17.774 --> 39:20.819
I mean, it's clear that
no one person makes this up.

39:20.903 --> 39:24.156
This grew from the community's
collective subconscious.

39:24.239 --> 39:28.493
A survival tool evolved from the need
to protect itself

39:28.577 --> 39:29.703
-and its children…
-[elevator dings]

39:29.786 --> 39:31.622
…from the horrors of the community.

39:33.665 --> 39:35.751
Bernadette and I tried the summoning.

39:35.834 --> 39:38.295
It's amazing how effective it can be.

39:38.378 --> 39:42.341
The suggestion that
you're being followed or stalked

39:42.424 --> 39:45.844
by something lurking
in your own reflection.

39:45.928 --> 39:47.095
But I get it.

39:49.264 --> 39:52.601
…intoxicating, inexplicably alluring

39:52.684 --> 39:55.020
about the promise of seeing a ghost.

39:55.103 --> 39:56.104
Almost as if…

40:03.153 --> 40:04.238
Come on.

40:04.988 --> 40:06.406
[elevator alarm rings]

40:08.784 --> 40:09.952
[laughs]

40:10.035 --> 40:11.161
[ringing stops]

40:11.954 --> 40:13.163
[clattering]

40:25.175 --> 40:26.552
[grunts] Ow!

40:44.862 --> 40:45.988
[raspy breathing]

40:54.037 --> 40:55.497
[raspy breathing continues]

40:56.415 --> 40:58.208
[glass cracking]

41:03.505 --> 41:05.048
[elevator whirs]

41:12.681 --> 41:13.932
[woman giggles]

41:15.642 --> 41:16.768
Hey.

41:21.356 --> 41:22.357
Excuse me.

41:22.441 --> 41:25.694
[woman on tape recorder] And she heard
a noise. Do you remember her name?

41:25.777 --> 41:28.071
[woman 2] I think
her name was Ruthie Jean,

41:28.155 --> 41:30.741
-and she heard this banging and smashing…
-[phone buzzing]

41:30.824 --> 41:33.035
…like somebody was trying to make
a hole in the wall.

41:33.118 --> 41:35.120
So, Ruthie called 911

41:35.204 --> 41:37.956
and she said, "There's somebody
coming through the walls."

41:38.040 --> 41:39.708
And they didn't believe her.

41:39.791 --> 41:42.211
[woman] They thought
the lady was crazy, right?

41:42.294 --> 41:44.087
[woman 2] Mm-hmm.
So, she called 911 again,

41:44.171 --> 41:46.381
and they still didn't believe her.

41:46.465 --> 41:49.343
And when they finally got there,
she was dead.

41:49.426 --> 41:50.761
[woman] Was she shot?

41:52.137 --> 41:53.388
[woman 2] No.

41:53.472 --> 41:56.850
No, she was killed with a hook.

41:56.934 --> 41:58.477
Yeah.

41:58.560 --> 42:00.145
[woman] Is it true?

42:00.229 --> 42:02.773
-Yeah, it is. I read it in the papers.
-[buzzing continues]

42:02.856 --> 42:04.691
Candyman killed her.

42:05.442 --> 42:08.195
[woman] Yeah, but--
I don't know nothing about that.

42:09.530 --> 42:10.531
Hello?

42:11.198 --> 42:12.241
I'm going out.

42:13.867 --> 42:15.702
We have the dinner tonight.

42:15.786 --> 42:17.371
I don't know how long I'll be.

42:17.454 --> 42:21.500
Jack Hyde is coming in from New York,
and he never comes to Chicago.

42:22.376 --> 42:24.920
So, please don't fuck this up.

42:25.003 --> 42:26.755
[Anthony] I'll be fine.

42:26.839 --> 42:27.881
[Brianna] For me.

42:28.590 --> 42:31.134
Don't fuck this up for me.

42:53.240 --> 42:54.741
[indistinct chatter]

42:59.454 --> 43:01.623
[man screaming]

43:01.707 --> 43:04.334
[baby crying]

43:14.845 --> 43:16.096
[doorbell rings]

43:16.805 --> 43:20.475
[art critic]
It's been a crazy couple of weeks.

43:21.852 --> 43:23.854
That is putting it mildly.

43:23.937 --> 43:25.272
[both laugh]

43:26.023 --> 43:29.735
As you can imagine, what I'm writing is
no longer an exhibition review.

43:29.818 --> 43:30.986
It's--

43:31.069 --> 43:33.947
It's now expanded into a larger article,

43:34.031 --> 43:35.657
which impacts both the works

43:35.741 --> 43:39.745
and the circumstances around the murders.

43:39.828 --> 43:41.038
I see.

43:41.121 --> 43:45.042
So, I just wanted to get
a few quotes from you.

43:46.460 --> 43:48.003
Well, I don't know much of anything.

43:48.086 --> 43:50.547
Your work is so macabre, and that's…

43:51.965 --> 43:55.052
pretty interesting,
considering what happened.

43:56.178 --> 43:57.638
That's a coincidence.

43:57.721 --> 44:00.098
I'm not saying that you're at fault,

44:00.182 --> 44:02.809
and I'm certainly not saying
that a ghost manifested

44:02.893 --> 44:06.939
by collective storytelling
killed a prominent art dealer.

44:07.022 --> 44:09.191
I'm just saying that…

44:10.734 --> 44:13.654
all of a sudden, your work seems…

44:15.739 --> 44:17.199
eternal.

44:17.282 --> 44:18.700
[upbeat piano music playing]

44:20.285 --> 44:21.453
What's next?

44:23.705 --> 44:25.707
I'm expanding the work into a series.

44:27.376 --> 44:29.545
I'm hoping to do a solo show.

44:30.712 --> 44:32.714
All about Candyman. Spread the word.

44:32.798 --> 44:34.591
Mmm, I love that idea.

44:35.592 --> 44:40.264
I'm surprised at how positive
your take on my piece seems to be now.

44:41.265 --> 44:42.975
Well, it grew on me.

44:43.058 --> 44:45.686
-Seemed like you didn't quite get it.
-No, I get it.

44:45.769 --> 44:49.273
It's the hood, gentrification, et cetera.

44:49.356 --> 44:51.692
Artists gentrify the hood?

44:53.110 --> 44:54.987
Who do you think makes the hood?

44:56.613 --> 45:00.450
The city cuts off a community
and waits for it to die.

45:01.827 --> 45:03.996
Then they invite developers in

45:04.079 --> 45:06.415
and say, "Hey, you artists,

45:06.498 --> 45:09.710
you young people, you white,
preferably or only…

45:11.044 --> 45:13.505
please come to the hood, it's cheap.

45:13.589 --> 45:17.384
And if you stick it out for a couple
of years, we'll bring you a Whole Foods."

45:18.719 --> 45:20.929
You wanna be a part of the story, right?

45:21.013 --> 45:22.556
Well, as a critic, I…

45:22.639 --> 45:24.975
To really engage with the work,

45:25.058 --> 45:26.393
to "get it"…

45:28.937 --> 45:30.022
you should say it.

45:30.105 --> 45:31.732
-Say what?
-Say his name.

45:31.815 --> 45:33.108
[laughs]

45:37.571 --> 45:39.198
Think I need to use the bathroom.

45:39.281 --> 45:41.033
Oh, this is as good a time as any.

45:42.534 --> 45:43.785
I dare you.

45:57.633 --> 45:59.218
[sighs]

47:03.198 --> 47:04.491
Ah!

47:17.129 --> 47:18.714

[raspy breathing continues]

48:40.337 --> 48:42.256
[bees buzzing]

48:55.602 --> 48:56.770
Are you all right?

49:04.695 --> 49:06.196
-I thought…
-What?

49:15.038 --> 49:16.248
I gotta go.

49:31.680 --> 49:32.806
[thud]

49:44.651 --> 49:46.612
[distorted dialogue]

49:46.695 --> 49:50.199
[man, muffled] Really?
No one's buying it, not that I care.

49:58.165 --> 49:59.416
Careful.

50:00.667 --> 50:05.589
I love being here.
It's so provincial, yet exciting.

50:06.715 --> 50:09.134
Oh, my God.
Have you met Danielle Harrington?

50:09.218 --> 50:11.845
-She's chief--
-Curator at the MCA.

50:11.929 --> 50:14.306
I find it crazy that
we actually haven't met yet.

50:14.389 --> 50:15.891
I've been so eager to meet you.

50:15.974 --> 50:18.560
Don't you start already. I get first dibs.

50:18.644 --> 50:22.773
Clive literally had to die
for Brianna to be free. Sorry.

50:22.856 --> 50:25.400
Jameson's doing a show
at my gallery in New York.

50:26.068 --> 50:28.987
I think it's
the perfect opportunity for you

50:29.071 --> 50:30.614
to spread your wings a bit more.

50:30.697 --> 50:32.032
Come to the big city.

50:32.115 --> 50:33.992
I could introduce you to
the women of Entre Nous

50:34.076 --> 50:35.160
if you decide on New York.

50:35.244 --> 50:37.663
Wow. Thank you.

50:37.746 --> 50:40.874
I've actually been considering
going out on my own.

50:40.958 --> 50:43.085
Don't you wanna focus
on working with artists

50:43.168 --> 50:46.088
instead of chasing outstanding invoices?

50:46.171 --> 50:49.591
You can change the institution
from the inside.

50:50.759 --> 50:52.427
You should come by the museum some time.

50:52.511 --> 50:54.429
Okay.

50:54.513 --> 50:56.014
-I think I'd like that.
-[phone buzzing]

50:56.098 --> 50:57.391
-[Jameson] Oh, my God.
-[phones chiming]

50:57.474 --> 50:58.559
-What's wrong?
-What's happening?

50:58.642 --> 51:01.228
Finley Stephens was found dead
in her apartment.

51:01.311 --> 51:02.980
[Danielle] Her husband found her.

51:03.063 --> 51:05.816
Poor thing. Oh, her husband's a suspect.

51:07.192 --> 51:09.653
-I have to go.
-Anthony.

51:09.736 --> 51:11.029
[gasps]

51:31.967 --> 51:33.093
Anthony?

51:33.177 --> 51:34.803
[Anthony] What is he?

51:34.887 --> 51:36.638
[William] Candyman ain't a he.

51:36.722 --> 51:38.974
Candyman's the whole damn hive.

51:40.392 --> 51:41.518
There are others?

51:43.061 --> 51:44.354
[William] Samuel Evans.

51:45.105 --> 51:48.692
Run down during
the white housing riots of the '50s.

51:48.775 --> 51:51.820
William Bell, lynched in the '20s.

51:52.738 --> 51:55.782
But the first one, where it all began,

51:55.866 --> 51:58.118
was in the 1890s.

51:58.202 --> 52:01.747
It's a story Helen found.
The story of Daniel Robitaille.

52:02.789 --> 52:07.044
He'd made a living touring the country
painting portraits for wealthy families.

52:07.127 --> 52:10.047
Mostly white, and they loved him.

52:10.839 --> 52:12.174
But you know how it goes.

52:13.759 --> 52:15.844
They love what we make

52:15.928 --> 52:17.012
but not us.

52:19.306 --> 52:21.183
One day, he's commissioned

52:21.266 --> 52:23.393
to paint the daughter
of a Chicago factory owner

52:23.477 --> 52:25.646
who made his fortune in the stockyards.

52:25.729 --> 52:26.730
Well,

52:26.813 --> 52:30.192
Robitaille committed
the ultimate sin of his time.

52:30.984 --> 52:32.736
They fell in love.

52:32.819 --> 52:35.072
They had an affair, she got pregnant.

52:35.155 --> 52:37.282
The girl tells her father, and, well…

52:37.366 --> 52:38.367
you know…

52:38.450 --> 52:41.161
He hires some men to hunt Robitaille down,

52:41.245 --> 52:42.663
told them to get creative.

52:43.497 --> 52:45.582
Chased him through here
in the middle of the day.

52:45.666 --> 52:46.792
He collapses from exhaustion

52:46.875 --> 52:49.545
right near where the old tower
in Chestnut used to be.

52:49.628 --> 52:52.130
They beat him. Tortured him.

52:52.214 --> 52:55.884
They cut off his arm
and jammed a meat hook in the stump.

52:55.968 --> 52:59.012
They smeared honeycomb
from the nearby hives on his chest

52:59.096 --> 53:00.389
and let the bees sting him.

53:00.472 --> 53:03.183
A crowd started to form to watch the show.

53:04.393 --> 53:05.936
The big finale:

53:06.019 --> 53:08.564
They set him on fire

53:08.647 --> 53:10.357
and he finally dies.

53:12.234 --> 53:14.194
But a story like that,

53:14.278 --> 53:15.571
a pain like that…

53:17.197 --> 53:18.615
lasts forever.

53:20.909 --> 53:22.202
That's Candyman.

53:27.374 --> 53:28.375
So…

53:30.502 --> 53:31.628
he's real?

53:31.712 --> 53:32.880
Bell is real.

53:32.963 --> 53:36.758
Samuel, Sherman, Daniel Robitaille.
They're all real.

53:37.593 --> 53:40.721
Candyman is how we deal with the fact
that these things happened.

53:40.804 --> 53:42.514
That they're still happening.

53:45.726 --> 53:47.060
Get some rest, young blood.

53:48.478 --> 53:50.022
You'll feel better in the morning.

54:07.039 --> 54:08.457
[Anthony] Don't look at those!

54:09.917 --> 54:11.376
What the fuck is this?

54:12.127 --> 54:13.795
You shouldn't be looking at this.

54:15.756 --> 54:18.842
Anthony, we are beyond
sensitive artist bullshit.

54:18.926 --> 54:21.136
What is going on?

54:22.137 --> 54:23.931
I think-- I think…

54:25.933 --> 54:28.727
-I made a mistake, Bri.
-What do you mean?

54:30.437 --> 54:32.314
-I brought him back.
-Who?

54:33.732 --> 54:35.400
You promise you won't think I'm crazy?

54:35.484 --> 54:36.902
Anthony, who?

54:40.989 --> 54:42.241
Oh, God.

54:43.367 --> 54:45.827
-Burke told me…
-God. Who is Burke?

54:45.911 --> 54:47.704
From the laundromat.
He knows about all of it.

54:47.788 --> 54:48.956
Knows about what?

54:50.541 --> 54:51.583
Candyman.

54:53.252 --> 54:55.462
-Candyman isn't real.
-I saw him!

54:55.546 --> 54:58.590
Candyman isn't real, Anthony!

55:00.133 --> 55:02.427
You know what is real?

55:02.511 --> 55:06.598
Me, Anthony. Me. This, this is real.

55:08.183 --> 55:10.060
-You don't understand.
-Okay.

55:10.143 --> 55:13.897
I will show you that-- Okay.

55:13.981 --> 55:15.941
-Candyman.
-No!

55:16.024 --> 55:17.025
Candyman!

55:17.109 --> 55:18.151
[screams]

55:19.987 --> 55:20.988
[screams]

55:22.239 --> 55:24.992
Don't… say his name.

55:25.075 --> 55:27.035
-You stay the fuck right there.
-Brianna…

55:27.119 --> 55:29.246
Don't follow me.

55:36.837 --> 55:40.340
[Troy] Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.
Let the motherfucker try and come up here.

55:40.424 --> 55:45.137
Fucking art ogre, fucking fee-fi-fo-fum.
Grady will stomp on his ass.

55:45.220 --> 55:47.973
-Ain't that right, Grady?
-If I have to stomp, I'll stomp.

55:48.056 --> 55:50.267
I mean, he literally was, like,

55:50.350 --> 55:53.395
"I summoned Candyman," and I'm like…

55:53.478 --> 55:55.105
Candyman ain't real, nigga.

55:55.189 --> 55:58.442
I told you not to start dating
that Dapper Dan-ass,

55:58.525 --> 56:01.778
li'l Basquiat-ass, fucking no-job Sun Ra--

56:01.862 --> 56:03.405
Troy. Okay.

56:03.488 --> 56:06.283
Ain't a dick on the planet good enough
to offset a demonology hobby.

56:06.366 --> 56:07.910
Okay, Troy, stop!

56:07.993 --> 56:10.204
What? It's the truth.
If Grady came up in here,

56:10.287 --> 56:12.122
smashing mirrors.

56:13.790 --> 56:14.791
Mirrors.

56:16.335 --> 56:17.336
He's right.

56:20.589 --> 56:22.090
-All right.
-You…

56:23.133 --> 56:25.219
take care of Lucy.

56:25.302 --> 56:27.596
And you are in time-out.

56:27.679 --> 56:28.805
Come here.

56:30.307 --> 56:31.517
Break it up.

56:36.813 --> 56:39.024
I spoke to Mom.

56:39.983 --> 56:42.402
She wants to close the storage unit out,

56:42.486 --> 56:45.364
so we finally have to deal
with Dad's work.

56:45.447 --> 56:47.366
I was thinking maybe we could

56:48.575 --> 56:49.952
sell or…

56:51.537 --> 56:55.541
-if you want to keep anything…
-No, I don't want any of that in my house.

56:55.624 --> 56:58.126
-Thank you.
-Then, sell or do a show.

56:58.210 --> 56:59.753
I think you should open a space.

56:59.837 --> 57:03.674
I'm not doing a show
of the thing that killed him, Troy.

57:03.757 --> 57:05.968
You can't hide everything, and…

57:06.051 --> 57:07.845
-and just hope it goes away.
-Troy…

57:07.928 --> 57:11.056
You don't have to be there every time
a tortured artist has a psychotic break.

57:16.728 --> 57:17.771
I'm sorry.

57:17.855 --> 57:18.897
[scoffs]

57:20.023 --> 57:21.358
Bri.

57:27.030 --> 57:28.740
I'm glad you're here.

57:30.826 --> 57:33.412
You can stay as long as you want,
on the condition you don't try

57:33.495 --> 57:34.913
and summon Candyman.

57:36.081 --> 57:37.791
Who would do that?

57:37.875 --> 57:39.835
-[bell ringing]
-What's up?

57:41.670 --> 57:44.214
[laughing, chattering]

57:47.384 --> 57:49.970
[girl] Trina was fooked up this weekend.

57:50.053 --> 57:53.223
-Guys, what should I do about my bangs?
-No one cares about your bangs.

57:53.307 --> 57:54.600
Annika, look at this.

57:54.683 --> 57:57.728
Trina's fucking trashed. Look.
Watch, watch, watch.

57:57.811 --> 58:00.439
-Samantha.
-Oh, my God, that's so sad.

58:01.148 --> 58:04.443
-[gasps] Oh, shit.
-Look at this chunky-ass vomit.

58:04.526 --> 58:06.904
Oh, my gosh, in front of everyone.

58:06.987 --> 58:08.780
Have you guys heard of Candyman?

58:10.240 --> 58:12.367
Fuck this. I changed my mind.
I'm not gonna do it.

58:12.451 --> 58:16.371
-Come on, Boof. Don't be a pussy.
-Why not? It's a warm and wonderful thing.

58:16.455 --> 58:17.956
Boof, we're already in formation.

58:18.040 --> 58:19.583
-Fine.
-Okay, ready?

58:19.666 --> 58:21.376
Candyman.

58:21.460 --> 58:22.961
All at once, dumbass.

58:26.548 --> 58:27.674
[all] Candyman.

58:29.218 --> 58:30.469
Candyman.

58:32.262 --> 58:33.472
Candyman.

58:36.099 --> 58:37.893
-Not today. Not today.
-Come on.

58:37.976 --> 58:39.686
[Haley] Two more times.

58:44.608 --> 58:46.151
[all] Candyman.

58:46.235 --> 58:47.361
One more.

58:49.530 --> 58:51.031
Candyman.

58:53.534 --> 58:56.119
Well, we're still alive, so…

59:00.290 --> 59:01.750
Hey, Trina.

59:02.960 --> 59:04.169
[Haley] Let's go.

59:09.132 --> 59:12.803
Hey, Triney, how's that hangover?
You're such a mess.

59:12.886 --> 59:14.221
[girls laughing]

59:14.304 --> 59:16.306
[banging]

59:16.390 --> 59:19.852
-Trina was fucking trashed.
-Don't let her drink that much.

59:19.935 --> 59:21.353
That's between her and her god.

59:22.187 --> 59:24.147
Trina, you broke the fucking door.

59:24.231 --> 59:26.733
[music on headphones]

59:28.068 --> 59:29.778
Haley, I'm too young to die. Open it.

59:29.862 --> 59:31.530
-I'm working on it.
-[bees buzzing]

59:31.613 --> 59:33.490
[raspy breathing]

59:36.326 --> 59:37.327
Guys…

59:37.411 --> 59:38.662
What the fuck?

59:38.745 --> 59:41.039
-Wait, I forgot my vape.
-Boof.

59:41.123 --> 59:43.750
You know, I don't think you should…

59:43.834 --> 59:45.210
-Boof?
-[thuds]

59:46.003 --> 59:47.004
Boof?

59:47.087 --> 59:48.297
[cracking]

59:48.380 --> 59:49.756
Boof?

59:51.925 --> 59:52.926
What are you doing?

59:53.010 --> 59:54.928
[cracking, crunching continues]

59:55.012 --> 59:57.264
[wet thud]

59:57.347 --> 59:59.641
[liquid running]

01:00:02.644 --> 01:00:03.854
[gasps]

01:00:06.857 --> 01:00:10.027
-Oh, my God, guys. Stop being so stupid!
-Haley!

01:00:10.110 --> 01:00:11.320
[muffled shouting]

01:00:11.403 --> 01:00:12.946
-[slashes]
-[blood spatters]

01:00:13.405 --> 01:00:15.365

[whimpers]

01:00:25.334 --> 01:00:27.127
-This isn't funny.
-[screaming continues]

01:00:29.087 --> 01:00:31.590
[Trina] You guys, what the fuck?
This isn't funny!

01:00:31.673 --> 01:00:32.674
[bee buzzing]

01:00:35.385 --> 01:00:37.346
[Annika whimpering]

01:00:40.098 --> 01:00:41.517
[Annika groans, grunts]

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.227
-[hook slashes]
-[squelches]

01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:45.812
-[music continues]
-No!

01:00:45.896 --> 01:00:47.564
[Haley screaming]

01:00:53.111 --> 01:00:55.030
[Haley] No!

01:00:55.113 --> 01:00:56.949
[hook slashes]

01:01:11.463 --> 01:01:12.923
[paper rustling]

01:01:19.763 --> 01:01:21.223
[grunts]

01:01:22.099 --> 01:01:23.517
[glass tinkling]

01:01:25.143 --> 01:01:26.311
[sighs]

01:01:29.439 --> 01:01:30.774
[groans]

01:01:46.748 --> 01:01:48.500
[whimpering]

01:01:52.045 --> 01:01:54.047
[strains]

01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:58.468
[gasping]

01:02:06.059 --> 01:02:08.145
[Danielle] We've been trying to move
in a fresher direction

01:02:08.228 --> 01:02:09.563
for the past few years,

01:02:09.646 --> 01:02:13.775
and our last curator was a great guy,
but just had a hard time getting there.

01:02:13.859 --> 01:02:16.695
[Brianna] Well, I've certainly noticed
a shift in programming

01:02:16.778 --> 01:02:19.615
-since you started here.
-Hopefully for the best.

01:02:20.115 --> 01:02:22.784
I'm so happy I finally got
to meet you at Jack's dinner.

01:02:22.868 --> 01:02:25.495
Yes. He's been trying
to get us together before.

01:02:25.579 --> 01:02:28.665
It's crazy about Clive.

01:02:28.749 --> 01:02:31.210
I heard you were the one
to find the bodies.

01:02:31.293 --> 01:02:32.628
Yeah…

01:02:32.711 --> 01:02:33.795
[guide speaking, indistinct]

01:02:33.879 --> 01:02:35.797
You've really emerged

01:02:35.881 --> 01:02:39.593
as an interesting figure amidst all this.

01:02:39.676 --> 01:02:42.346
The show you put together
sounded so good too.

01:02:42.429 --> 01:02:45.641
You were so brave to embrace formlessness.

01:02:45.724 --> 01:02:50.145
Actually, there were a lot of bodies--
figures in the show.

01:02:50.229 --> 01:02:51.855
Like Arnold's work.

01:02:51.939 --> 01:02:57.236
For so long, abstraction has been about
indexing a sublimated emotional state,

01:02:57.319 --> 01:03:00.239
-and I just wanted to focus on the body.
-Of course, but I mean,

01:03:00.322 --> 01:03:03.200
between the recent tragedies
and your father's legacy,

01:03:03.283 --> 01:03:05.702
you've got a fascinating story.

01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:08.247
Right.

01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:10.707
And your eye for emerging talent.

01:03:10.791 --> 01:03:13.126
How long have you worked
with Anthony McCoy?

01:03:14.044 --> 01:03:15.838
Just a couple years.

01:03:15.921 --> 01:03:19.842
My board members are buzzing
about McCoy's work.

01:03:19.925 --> 01:03:24.346
Feels like a Project Room show
is something we could start talking about.

01:03:25.639 --> 01:03:28.433
And of course, any other artist
you have your eye on.

01:03:34.982 --> 01:03:38.277
[reporter on TV] The Near North Side
community, once known as Cabrini-Green,

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:42.406
is stunned by the vicious mass murder
at Golin College Prep.

01:03:42.489 --> 01:03:45.450
Police have found a startling link
to the art world murders,

01:03:45.534 --> 01:03:48.620
in particular a piece called Say My Name,

01:03:48.704 --> 01:03:51.456
which was written in the victims' blood
on the bathroom wall.

01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:53.667
[doctor] Welcome back, Mr. McCoy.

01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:55.002
What?

01:03:55.544 --> 01:03:57.671
I saw in your file you were born here.

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:02.176
I was born on the South Side.

01:04:03.844 --> 01:04:05.721
No, it says you were born here.

01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:07.514
[voices whispering]

01:04:07.598 --> 01:04:10.142
Regardless, it's good that
you came in when you did.

01:04:10.225 --> 01:04:13.729
We need to admit you immediately
for monitoring and do some more testing.

01:04:15.147 --> 01:04:17.149
[rain pattering]

01:04:31.788 --> 01:04:33.290
[knocks]

01:04:40.088 --> 01:04:42.090
[door opens, creaks]

01:04:45.052 --> 01:04:47.304
Anthony, where have you been?

01:04:55.437 --> 01:04:56.855
What happened to your hand?

01:04:57.648 --> 01:04:59.274
Looks bad.

01:05:01.026 --> 01:05:04.071
Went to River North Memorial,
near Cabrini.

01:05:06.073 --> 01:05:07.908
They fixed me right up.

01:05:10.452 --> 01:05:11.745
You've been painting?

01:05:12.704 --> 01:05:14.540
[chuckles]

01:05:14.623 --> 01:05:18.585
Yeah, I've been inspired a lot, actually,

01:05:18.669 --> 01:05:20.462
by Cabrini.

01:05:21.505 --> 01:05:23.423
[sniffs] You want some tea?

01:05:23.507 --> 01:05:25.551
I heard a story about a fire.

01:05:26.343 --> 01:05:28.387
Killed a woman named Helen Lyle.

01:05:29.721 --> 01:05:31.348
A baby that was taken.

01:05:32.224 --> 01:05:34.393
Something they used to call Candyman.

01:05:34.476 --> 01:05:36.061
[shushes]

01:05:36.937 --> 01:05:38.647
Don't.

01:05:38.730 --> 01:05:40.148
Don't say that.

01:05:44.236 --> 01:05:47.030
You told me I was born on the South Side.

01:05:47.114 --> 01:05:49.408
I did raise you in the home you remember.

01:05:51.618 --> 01:05:55.122
But you were born in River North Memorial

01:05:55.205 --> 01:05:57.916
and spent the first two years in Cabrini.

01:05:59.126 --> 01:06:00.752
Why did you lie?

01:06:02.588 --> 01:06:04.006
To protect you.

01:06:09.011 --> 01:06:10.137
From what?

01:06:13.557 --> 01:06:18.604
I just wanted you to grow up happy

01:06:18.687 --> 01:06:20.230
and normal.

01:06:26.528 --> 01:06:28.155
Do I look normal, Mama?

01:06:33.827 --> 01:06:35.746
-[grunts]
-I have to know.

01:06:37.456 --> 01:06:38.457
Now.

01:06:40.083 --> 01:06:41.335
[sighs]

01:06:48.884 --> 01:06:53.305
When you first got taken,
I thought she was the one who did it.

01:07:03.232 --> 01:07:04.525
[sobs]

01:07:07.236 --> 01:07:11.156
When you first got taken,
I thought she was the one who did it.

Helen.

01:07:13.283 --> 01:07:14.743
[fire crackling]

01:07:18.038 --> 01:07:20.874
The way I found her in her apartment,

01:07:20.958 --> 01:07:22.501
covered in blood.

01:07:23.961 --> 01:07:26.004
We all thought she was crazy.

01:07:32.177 --> 01:07:33.846
But it wasn't her.

01:07:38.141 --> 01:07:39.726
It was him.

01:07:39.810 --> 01:07:41.186
[fire crackling]

01:07:43.522 --> 01:07:45.440
He had a purpose for you.

01:07:45.524 --> 01:07:47.401
[baby cooing]

01:07:47.484 --> 01:07:49.152
He chose you to be

01:07:49.236 --> 01:07:51.572
one of his victims.

01:07:52.573 --> 01:07:55.659
He wanted you to burn in that fire.

01:07:55.742 --> 01:07:58.078
But she pulled you out…

01:07:59.872 --> 01:08:02.124
and gave you back to me.

01:08:03.458 --> 01:08:04.626

01:08:08.422 --> 01:08:10.924
-I thought it ended that night.
-[Candyman] Wait!

01:08:12.050 --> 01:08:14.803
[Anne-Marie] In the fire.
I thought she ended it.

01:08:17.014 --> 01:08:19.850
And we vowed to never say his name again.

01:08:24.395 --> 01:08:25.898
But…

01:08:26.732 --> 01:08:30.736
someone broke the pact and…

01:08:30.819 --> 01:08:32.069
He found me.

01:08:32.154 --> 01:08:33.529
[sobs]

01:08:33.613 --> 01:08:35.698

01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:40.871
I'm sorry.

01:08:46.502 --> 01:08:49.712
Anthony, wait, wait. Baby, wait.

01:08:49.796 --> 01:08:51.548
Where are you going?

01:08:51.631 --> 01:08:54.343
Anthony, baby, wait, wait, wait.

01:08:54.426 --> 01:08:56.428

01:09:47.604 --> 01:09:48.897
Anthony?

01:09:49.648 --> 01:09:50.858
It is Troy.

01:09:51.942 --> 01:09:56.321
Come out immediately where I can see you.

01:09:56.405 --> 01:09:59.783
-Immediately.
-Troy, stop. Please, oh, my gosh.

01:09:59.867 --> 01:10:03.412
We are picking up her things

01:10:03.495 --> 01:10:04.997
and we will…

01:10:06.373 --> 01:10:08.542
be leaving with them.

01:10:08.625 --> 01:10:10.419
I see. Yeah, thanks.

01:10:11.253 --> 01:10:12.838
He's not with Noah either.

01:10:13.881 --> 01:10:15.424
What the hell is going on?

01:10:15.507 --> 01:10:18.886
-Maybe Candyman got his ass.
-That's not funny, Troy.

01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:59.885
Hello?

01:11:08.435 --> 01:11:09.645
[door lock clicks]

[doorknob rattles]

01:11:31.708 --> 01:11:33.252
Nope.

01:11:47.933 --> 01:11:50.853
Hello! Excuse me!

-[boy] Please. I'm not scared anymore.
-[girl] Go play with your puppets.

01:12:13.876 --> 01:12:16.420
[boy] I'm gonna pee on your bed
if you don't let me in.

01:12:16.503 --> 01:12:18.297
[girl] You're being so annoying right now.

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:21.049
-What are you doing?
-[girl] Mind your business.

01:12:21.133 --> 01:12:23.510
Come on, let me play. Please.

01:12:23.594 --> 01:12:26.680
[girl] This game is for grown-ups,
and you're a big baby.

01:12:26.763 --> 01:12:28.265
[Billy] I'm not a baby.

01:12:28.348 --> 01:12:29.641
Go away!

01:13:22.653 --> 01:13:23.654
Now…

01:13:25.572 --> 01:13:26.949
we have a witness.

01:13:34.039 --> 01:13:36.124
[man] I think I saw the guy
you're looking for.

01:13:36.208 --> 01:13:37.835
The "Say My Name" killer.

01:13:37.918 --> 01:13:40.462
He's roaming around
the row houses at Cabrini.

01:13:40.546 --> 01:13:42.089
A Black man, around 30.

01:13:42.172 --> 01:13:46.093
He was waving a hook and talking crazy.
I think he's killing people down there!

01:13:46.176 --> 01:13:47.302
[chair rattles]

01:13:47.386 --> 01:13:48.720

01:14:02.484 --> 01:14:04.069
I was baptized here.

01:14:06.738 --> 01:14:07.948
Isn't it beautiful?

-A-- A-- A-- Anthony?
-[voices whispering]

01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:20.544
[William] When something leaves a stain,

01:14:20.627 --> 01:14:23.130
even if you wash it out,

01:14:23.213 --> 01:14:24.214
it's still there.

01:14:25.465 --> 01:14:26.675
You can feel it.

01:14:27.634 --> 01:14:30.220
A thinning, deep in the fabric.

01:14:32.681 --> 01:14:35.559
This neighborhood got caught in a loop.

01:14:35.642 --> 01:14:39.479
The shit got stained
in the exact same spot,

01:14:39.563 --> 01:14:41.231
over and over,

01:14:41.315 --> 01:14:43.942
until it finally rotted
from the inside out.

01:14:44.026 --> 01:14:45.110
[gasping]

01:14:45.194 --> 01:14:48.280
[William] They tore down our homes,
so they could move back in.

01:14:48.363 --> 01:14:50.741
We need Candyman.

01:14:51.617 --> 01:14:54.578
'Cause this time,
he'll be killing their fathers,

01:14:55.329 --> 01:14:58.540
their babies, their sisters.

01:15:00.167 --> 01:15:04.963
I knew it was only a matter of time
before the baby came back here,

01:15:05.047 --> 01:15:07.132
in perfect symmetry.

01:15:07.216 --> 01:15:11.803
A chance for Candyman to take back
what's rightfully his.

[Brianna whimpering]

But… [grunts] …some of the specifics

01:15:46.713 --> 01:15:48.799

artist who lost his mind,

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.861
and the cops showed up
and shot him down in cold blood

without even saying a word.

Well, say his name, if you dare!

Say it five times in a mirror.
See what happens.

01:16:20.747 --> 01:16:24.293
When it's all done,
they'll tell his story,

01:16:24.376 --> 01:16:26.962
and Candyman will live…

01:18:36.258 --> 01:18:37.342
Brianna.

01:18:37.426 --> 01:18:38.927
[whimpering]

01:18:42.306 --> 01:18:44.183
[panting]

01:18:58.363 --> 01:18:59.865
No, no!

01:19:01.575 --> 01:19:03.493
Get up, Anthony. Get up.

01:19:04.661 --> 01:19:06.496
Baby, baby, baby…

01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:09.750
-[sirens continue]
-Please. No. No.

01:19:09.833 --> 01:19:11.793
Anthony, baby.

01:19:11.877 --> 01:19:14.505
-[whispering] It's okay.
-Get up, please.

01:19:14.588 --> 01:19:18.008
Please.
Please stay with me, Anthony, please.

01:19:18.091 --> 01:19:21.345
Please, please, please. Please get up.

01:19:21.428 --> 01:19:23.472
Please get up, Anthony.

01:19:23.555 --> 01:19:25.015
[police sirens wailing]

01:19:25.098 --> 01:19:26.141
Don't go.

01:19:26.225 --> 01:19:29.019
We're gonna get you help.
We're gonna get you to a hospital.

01:19:29.102 --> 01:19:30.437
We're gonna get you to a hospital.

01:19:30.521 --> 01:19:32.147
In here!

01:19:33.190 --> 01:19:35.067
-[officer] Put your hands up!
-He just needs…

01:19:35.150 --> 01:19:36.735
[gunshots firing]

01:19:38.862 --> 01:19:40.864
[ringing]

01:20:06.890 --> 01:20:08.600
[gasps]

01:20:10.811 --> 01:20:12.813
[whimpering]

01:20:14.815 --> 01:20:16.149
Oh, my God.

01:20:21.405 --> 01:20:23.198
[siren wails]

01:20:25.242 --> 01:20:26.952
[officer] Hey. Stay on your feet.

01:20:27.035 --> 01:20:28.704
-Come on. Move it.
-[officer 2] What's going on?

01:20:28.787 --> 01:20:30.747
[officer] We got two suspects, one's down.

01:20:30.831 --> 01:20:32.875
-[officer 2] Get her in the car.
-[officer 3] Hurry up.

01:20:34.626 --> 01:20:36.253
[officer 3] We didn't know what to do.

01:20:41.425 --> 01:20:43.385
[gasping]

01:20:43.468 --> 01:20:45.345
[officers, indistinct]

01:20:49.266 --> 01:20:51.268
[breathing slows]

01:21:03.947 --> 01:21:05.449
[door closes]

01:21:06.325 --> 01:21:07.784
[sighs]

01:21:10.537 --> 01:21:13.582
Very unfortunate
what happened to your man in there.

01:21:16.210 --> 01:21:17.711
We'd been looking for him.

01:21:19.046 --> 01:21:20.547
Got a tip he'd be here.

01:21:22.674 --> 01:21:24.176
You know anything about that?

01:21:28.222 --> 01:21:30.307
Whatever you tell us helps.

01:21:31.642 --> 01:21:33.310
Any cooperation is noted.

01:21:34.311 --> 01:21:35.938
Saying what you saw

01:21:36.813 --> 01:21:38.190
when he came at Jones…

01:21:39.525 --> 01:21:42.444
and Jones, obviously knowing
what he'd done before,

01:21:42.528 --> 01:21:46.073
seeing his hook,
knowing you were in danger,

01:21:46.156 --> 01:21:48.909
had no choice but to discharge his weapon.

01:21:53.413 --> 01:21:54.790
Doesn't sound right to you?

01:21:57.417 --> 01:21:58.794
[sighs]

01:21:59.628 --> 01:22:00.629
Or…

01:22:01.755 --> 01:22:03.340
she's an accomplice.

01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:08.053
She held the victims down, he cut 'em up.

01:22:09.638 --> 01:22:11.598
He died coming at a cop.

01:22:12.516 --> 01:22:15.435
She goes to jail for the rest of her life.

01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:21.441
Which story is it?

01:22:28.198 --> 01:22:30.492
Can I see myself?

01:22:30.576 --> 01:22:31.869
What?

01:22:31.952 --> 01:22:33.453
[Brianna] In the mirror.

01:22:34.955 --> 01:22:38.542
I'll tell you everything
if you let me see myself.

01:22:40.377 --> 01:22:41.503
No.

01:22:43.088 --> 01:22:44.798
I'll say whatever you want.

01:22:49.303 --> 01:22:51.305
[sighs]

01:22:58.437 --> 01:22:59.688
Candyman.

01:23:05.777 --> 01:23:07.237
Candyman.

01:23:07.321 --> 01:23:09.198
[scoffs] What?

01:23:12.701 --> 01:23:14.036
Candyman.

01:23:15.329 --> 01:23:16.872
What the fuck is that?

01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:21.502
-Candyman.
-Candyman?

01:23:27.007 --> 01:23:28.383
What the fuck?

01:23:28.467 --> 01:23:29.760
-[door rattling]
-[officer] Holy shit.

01:23:29.843 --> 01:23:32.012
Rooney? Jesus. What the fuck?

01:23:32.095 --> 01:23:35.265
[officer] 10-1, emergency. Officer down.
Officer down.

01:23:35.349 --> 01:23:36.767
What the fuck!

01:23:36.850 --> 01:23:39.228
-Get on the ground now! Now!
-[gunshots firing]

01:23:44.024 --> 01:23:45.192
What the fuck!

01:23:47.027 --> 01:23:48.487
-[officer] Let me in.
-I can't!

01:23:48.570 --> 01:23:49.821
[officer] Let me in, damn it!

01:23:50.781 --> 01:23:52.574
-Stop!
-No, no, no, no, no!

01:23:52.658 --> 01:23:53.909
[shouts]

01:23:54.576 --> 01:23:55.827
Holy shit!

01:23:57.538 --> 01:23:58.914
What the fuck?

01:24:03.752 --> 01:24:05.754
[bees buzzing]

01:24:09.466 --> 01:24:10.634
Who are you?

01:24:13.136 --> 01:24:14.596
[Anthony] I am

01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:16.390
the writing on the walls.

01:24:17.683 --> 01:24:21.812
I'm the sweet smell of blood
on the street.

01:24:23.438 --> 01:24:26.358
The buzz that echoes in the alleyways.

01:24:27.943 --> 01:24:31.154
They will say I shed innocent blood.

01:24:31.238 --> 01:24:33.574
You are far from innocent,

01:24:33.657 --> 01:24:35.492
but they'll say you were.

01:24:36.493 --> 01:24:38.078
That's all that matters.

01:24:42.499 --> 01:24:43.959
[sighs]

01:24:44.835 --> 01:24:46.837
[breathing heavily]

01:24:51.133 --> 01:24:52.176
[door opens]

01:24:54.887 --> 01:24:55.888
[door closes]

01:25:11.195 --> 01:25:13.280
-[police radio, indistinct]
-[distant groans]

01:25:17.326 --> 01:25:19.328
[officer choking, groaning]

01:25:23.832 --> 01:25:25.334
[bees buzzing]

01:25:26.543 --> 01:25:28.253
[officer shouts]

01:25:35.677 --> 01:25:37.387
[police sirens wailing]

01:25:39.348 --> 01:25:41.266
[buzzing continues]

01:25:57.991 --> 01:25:59.201
Tell…

01:26:00.661 --> 01:26:02.204
everyone.

01:26:03.705 --> 01:26:05.832
[tires screeching]
