00:10.745 --> 00:13.413
Good morning, darlings.

00:13.447 --> 00:15.583
I'm Alpha One-Nine
and here every day

00:15.617 --> 00:18.820
to disseminate the dirt,
destroy the disinformation

00:18.853 --> 00:23.858
and hopefully, God willing,
deliver a soupcon of hope.

00:25.392 --> 00:28.061
It is day 592 since the
outbreak of COVID-19 Delta

00:28.095 --> 00:31.398
and you are listening
the Doomsday Daily.

00:32.734 --> 00:34.836
I'm part of the small but
fierce network of radio ops

00:34.869 --> 00:38.506
across this sad but so
far undefeated country.

00:38.540 --> 00:42.944
I believe that we are defeated,
but we are still here,

00:42.977 --> 00:45.613
so here's your news.

00:45.647 --> 00:48.016
I would have loved
being at that meeting

00:48.048 --> 00:49.717
where the people in
charge thought it would be

00:49.751 --> 00:52.854
a good idea to take
the healthy folks

00:52.887 --> 00:54.822
and put them into the camps.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.625
'Cause putting lots
of people in camps,

00:57.659 --> 01:00.929
that's always worked out
so well in the past, right?

01:00.962 --> 01:03.297
In Pennsylvania where the
remaining isolation camp

01:03.330 --> 01:05.767
is located reports are
clogging the frequencies

01:05.800 --> 01:08.302
verifying an infected
person or a persons

01:08.335 --> 01:10.304
entered Camp Bastion.

01:10.337 --> 01:14.308
Almost all 20,000
people are dead.

01:14.341 --> 01:16.811
Rumors are someone's planted
a napalm in the area,

01:16.844 --> 01:18.412
well, I would love to
know who got their hands

01:18.445 --> 01:19.781
on that kinda shit.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.921
What do we do here?

01:52.112 --> 01:54.381
Your fever's gone.

01:55.950 --> 01:57.317
That's impossible.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.409
How far are we?

02:23.310 --> 02:24.344
Less than a day.

02:25.580 --> 02:26.948
We could be there
tomorrow morning

02:26.981 --> 02:28.850
if we push through all night.

02:33.855 --> 02:35.222
Sarah, what are you doing?

02:38.860 --> 02:40.728
Food, Guy, we need food.

02:40.762 --> 02:42.295
Yeah, we'll find it.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.732
We haven't eaten since
yesterday, we haven't slept.

02:44.766 --> 02:47.334
Come on, we can't sleep
til we get to Ben's.

02:49.871 --> 02:51.739
Are you sure
Ben will be there?

02:51.773 --> 02:54.174
When his dad died
he went a little nuts,

02:54.207 --> 02:55.710
became something
of a survivalist.

02:55.743 --> 02:58.780
He started stockpiling
things, fortifying his land.

03:02.917 --> 03:04.886
As long as he didn't get
sick, he'll be there.

03:08.923 --> 03:09.724
Over here.

03:18.066 --> 03:19.332
Slow down, sis.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.367
- I'm too hungry.
- It has to hydrate.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.070
No, I'm too hungry.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.582
You promise Ben will take us in?

03:34.615 --> 03:36.851
He was my mentor
at the bureau,

03:36.884 --> 03:38.753
one of the best FBI
agents I've ever seen.

03:38.786 --> 03:39.954
He won't turn us away.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.591
He might when he
finds out who I am.

03:43.624 --> 03:44.926
Listen, we had to run.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.360
At least there we
would've been running

03:47.394 --> 03:48.462
from that nut job.

03:49.931 --> 03:50.932
I know.

03:52.232 --> 03:55.435
I know, I still can't figure
out how he found out about you.

04:00.842 --> 04:03.978
It was that nurse,
I'm telling you.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.614
She got all kinds of religious.

04:08.182 --> 04:09.784
Like some kind of fanatic.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.021
And he was her god.

04:36.309 --> 04:38.713
Do you see anything?

04:47.387 --> 04:50.024
She's gotta be here somewhere!

04:50.992 --> 04:53.094
What do we do?

04:53.127 --> 04:53.961
How does he keep finding us?

04:53.995 --> 04:55.395
It's been weeks.

04:56.564 --> 04:57.965
Run!

05:03.871 --> 05:06.274
Don't shoot
her, we need her alive.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.041
You need to run.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.109
No, what about you?

05:08.142 --> 05:09.010
I have to protect you.

05:09.043 --> 05:09.977
No, I'm not gonna let you die.

05:10.011 --> 05:11.344
Yes, you are.

05:15.049 --> 05:17.384
You've known it was
eventually gonna end this way.

05:23.157 --> 05:25.392
Keep running west until
you find Route 21.

05:25.425 --> 05:26.794
Stay off the roads.

05:26.828 --> 05:28.428
Don't stop until
you get to Ben's.

05:32.033 --> 05:33.201
Go!

05:34.434 --> 05:35.903
Get the girl!

05:51.185 --> 05:52.653
You
know, I do feel sorry

05:52.687 --> 05:54.589
for those who tried
to run Camp Bastion.

05:56.190 --> 05:58.759
I think it was the last place
pretending to be civilization

05:58.793 --> 06:02.362
as if COVID Prime,
I just made that up,

06:02.395 --> 06:05.900
wasn't bad enough, it
just kept mutating,

06:05.933 --> 06:07.835
getting stronger each time.

06:07.869 --> 06:10.004
Things didn't get
completely discombobulated

06:10.037 --> 06:11.672
until the great
collapse due to the lack

06:11.706 --> 06:14.441
of healthy workers, which
then caused the first

06:14.474 --> 06:16.711
of the nuke plants to melt down.

06:16.744 --> 06:19.379
Then no food, no supplies,

06:19.412 --> 06:23.351
and you know what that
led to; land pirates.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.753
Marauders acting all
rapey and pillagey

06:25.786 --> 06:28.455
and the cities
descending into chaos.

06:28.488 --> 06:29.757
Survival of the vicious.

06:30.625 --> 06:32.226
But I have a question.

06:32.260 --> 06:35.796
What do the land pirates
do when they've plundered

06:35.830 --> 06:38.099
everything in the cities?

06:38.132 --> 06:40.968
They go into the
country where people

06:41.002 --> 06:42.870
have stockpiles of stuff.

06:42.904 --> 06:45.373
And we all know what
that means, right?

06:45.405 --> 06:47.708
We're back in the
wild wild west.

08:04.318 --> 08:06.687
In the "What Does It
Matter Anyway?" Category,

08:06.721 --> 08:10.891
they're saying at
Camp Bastion survived.

08:10.925 --> 08:12.860
Like Lazarus going for a stroll,

08:12.893 --> 08:16.731
he just left death's door
and he did not look back.

08:16.764 --> 08:19.066
Now, this is, of course,
something we haven't seen before

08:19.100 --> 08:23.337
so you ask, "Did he just
walk out of the camp"?

08:23.371 --> 08:24.939
Why yes, yes he did.

08:26.107 --> 08:28.409
After killing a couple
of the caretakers,

08:28.442 --> 08:32.313
and like any good messiah,
he got himself some followers

08:32.346 --> 08:33.347
and he's on a quest.

08:34.115 --> 08:36.049
What and where?

08:36.082 --> 08:36.884
No clue.

08:38.119 --> 08:39.486
The big brains at the
World Health Organization

08:39.520 --> 08:43.256
said 1% of the infected
could be asymptomatic.

08:44.725 --> 08:48.229
So batten down the hatches,
dial up the paranoia,

08:48.262 --> 08:50.498
stranger danger, all that.

08:50.531 --> 08:54.368
Watch out for unknowing
carriers and deranged messiahs.

08:55.703 --> 08:58.339
I'm not saying you might need
to drop people you don't know,

08:58.372 --> 09:00.274
but you might just
need to drop people

09:00.307 --> 09:02.109
that you don't know.

09:03.477 --> 09:06.180
Like I tell ya, darlings,
keep your asses home,

09:06.213 --> 09:09.116
stockpile your food, make
sure your guns are clean,

09:09.150 --> 09:10.251
take care of yourselves.

09:11.419 --> 09:15.256
With that, all right,
I'm back tomorrow.

09:15.289 --> 09:16.457
Maybe.

09:22.329 --> 09:22.730
How much further?

09:23.564 --> 09:24.331
We're close.

09:26.467 --> 09:28.169
Do you think she could've
gotten here already?

09:29.737 --> 09:31.939
On foot she could've gone
straight across the land.

09:33.841 --> 09:36.545
She's either there or
we'll be waiting for her.

09:36.577 --> 09:39.113
When we get her we're
gonna protect her, right?

09:39.146 --> 09:41.982
What'd you think
we'd do with her?

09:42.016 --> 09:44.685
We're gonna breed her,
it feels kinda cruel to me.

09:46.287 --> 09:47.321
She's our hope, Owen.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.957
This is how we make sure
this planet keeps going.

09:51.992 --> 09:54.161
But how many others are
gonna be hunting for her too?

09:54.195 --> 09:55.496
Shut the hell up!

09:58.632 --> 10:01.702
We follow Aaron's
plan without question.

10:03.204 --> 10:04.539
Without hesitation.

10:09.210 --> 10:12.279
He saw death and laughed at him.

10:13.681 --> 10:14.849
And death set him free.

10:16.317 --> 10:19.753
And now I'm the one who
decides who lives and who dies.

10:19.787 --> 10:21.021
Me.

10:21.055 --> 10:23.357
I conquered this virus
and every one of you

10:23.390 --> 10:25.292
is still breathing
because of me.

10:26.827 --> 10:29.430
I kept the virus away
from you, I pulled you all

10:29.463 --> 10:33.467
out of the trash and
made your lives whole.

10:33.502 --> 10:34.735
I gave it order.

10:36.203 --> 10:39.707
And I can make you
un-whole just as fast.

10:39.740 --> 10:42.877
Death gave me the
sight, but it is only

10:42.910 --> 10:45.646
the true believers who
will reap the reward.

10:47.181 --> 10:51.085
I will make everything right
again through this girl.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.354
Do any of you doubt me?

10:55.389 --> 10:56.257
You're the boss.

10:58.659 --> 11:00.227
Do any of you doubt me?

11:05.432 --> 11:06.867
Yes, I am the boss.

11:09.370 --> 11:10.639
And why is that?

11:10.671 --> 11:13.274
Because everyone is
looking for this girl

11:14.341 --> 11:16.277
but only I was
able to track her.

11:18.913 --> 11:19.914
And do you know why?

11:21.849 --> 11:24.586
Because he showed me where to go

11:24.619 --> 11:28.355
and he will show me what to
do when she's in our hands.

11:55.617 --> 11:58.252
I'm starting to hear things.

12:04.425 --> 12:06.293
It's been too quiet
out here, Dad.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.731
Starting to lose my mind.

12:28.282 --> 12:29.149
Hey, Ben.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.185
Take a second.

12:35.022 --> 12:37.458
Look how beautiful this is.

12:37.491 --> 12:38.759
How lucky are we?

12:41.195 --> 12:41.962
Yeah.

12:43.497 --> 12:45.299
Small enough that I
can keep my eye on you

12:45.332 --> 12:47.602
and big enough that I don't
have to see your ass every day.

12:47.636 --> 12:50.605
Hey, I'm the one who's
supposed to keep an eye on you.

12:52.172 --> 12:55.342
I promised Mom I'd protect
you, not the other way around.

12:55.376 --> 12:56.477
It was a joke.

12:58.513 --> 13:01.448
You losing the ranch
was never a joke to her.

13:01.482 --> 13:02.617
- Losing it?
- Yeah.

13:04.719 --> 13:06.487
We ain't gonna lose shit.

13:06.521 --> 13:09.591
Your FBI pension is
keeping us afloat

13:09.624 --> 13:10.958
until things turn around.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.495
You'll see.

13:16.631 --> 13:17.965
Things are never
gonna turn around if

13:17.998 --> 13:20.301
you keep blowing through
your money the way you do.

13:21.302 --> 13:22.970
Not now, Ben, please.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.006
Just enjoy nature.

13:26.040 --> 13:27.841
Have some fun for once.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.979
It's never gonna be a
good time for you, is it?

13:32.012 --> 13:34.014
You just keep on running.

14:21.261 --> 14:22.664
Hey.

14:22.697 --> 14:24.231
Hey.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.065
Wake up.

14:26.300 --> 14:27.301
Ben Grant.

14:31.205 --> 14:31.972
Hey!

14:33.708 --> 14:34.908
What name did you just say?

14:36.544 --> 14:37.545
Ben Grant.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.259
Guy Hodges.

15:34.134 --> 15:34.935
Damn.

15:46.548 --> 15:47.615
Upstairs.

15:48.683 --> 15:49.784
Go, first step.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.166
Howdy.

17:14.201 --> 17:15.537
Name's Matthew.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.106
What can I do for ya?

17:20.642 --> 17:21.943
Why, you see, we've been
living out of this thing

17:21.976 --> 17:26.113
for awhile now and we're
running out of supplies.

17:26.146 --> 17:27.615
Any of you infected?

17:27.648 --> 17:29.817
No, no, we're all good.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.794
Can't help you.

17:39.827 --> 17:41.094
Can't spare anything.

17:41.963 --> 17:43.565
What'd you say your name was?

17:43.598 --> 17:44.331
I didn't.

17:46.734 --> 17:48.570
You should probably keep going.

17:48.603 --> 17:50.638
I've searched for
miles, I found nothing.

18:04.586 --> 18:06.754
Are you Heath Grant's son?

18:08.355 --> 18:09.323
Don't I know you?

18:11.258 --> 18:13.828
I don't think so, but
it wouldn't surprise me.

18:16.196 --> 18:16.998
Stop!

18:18.600 --> 18:20.902
All right, all right.

18:20.935 --> 18:21.869
What do you want?

18:23.470 --> 18:25.673
Since we aren't armed,
perhaps we could have

18:25.707 --> 18:27.809
a conversation without the gun?

18:40.788 --> 18:41.556
Nope!

18:43.357 --> 18:46.995
I know it's the end of
the world but couldn't

18:47.028 --> 18:48.930
you show us some decency?

18:48.963 --> 18:50.898
I'll put mine
down when she does.

18:54.736 --> 18:56.871
Ah, that's my friend Marley.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.140
You caught us.

19:02.877 --> 19:05.113
A little insurance
always comes in handy,

19:05.145 --> 19:07.915
clearly you're a man
who understands that.

19:10.150 --> 19:13.721
As I said, I'll put
mine down when she does.

19:13.755 --> 19:15.857
Well, that's not gonna happen.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.726
So we're gonna have to make due.

19:18.760 --> 19:21.629
Now, listen, as my
friend here mentioned,

19:21.663 --> 19:24.799
we're gonna be relieving
you of some supplies,

19:24.832 --> 19:28.002
but more importantly I
think you may have something

19:28.036 --> 19:30.038
that belongs to me.

19:30.071 --> 19:31.171
What would that be?

19:32.674 --> 19:37.078
That would be a girl
about yay high, dark hair.

19:40.213 --> 19:41.181
Haven't seen her!

19:43.383 --> 19:46.821
Not exactly a time to be letting
strangers into your home.

19:46.854 --> 19:50.892
No, but maybe we could
have a look around,

19:50.925 --> 19:53.260
see if she's hiding
on your property.

19:55.395 --> 19:56.898
Why's she so important to you?

19:58.099 --> 20:01.836
She's important to
the future of mankind,

20:01.869 --> 20:04.906
but that's all you need
to know about that.

20:06.641 --> 20:08.042
So, what do you say?

20:08.076 --> 20:10.712
Can we have a look around and
we look and we don't find her

20:10.745 --> 20:12.412
we leave, no one gets hurt?

20:14.448 --> 20:15.583
Except a girl.

20:18.653 --> 20:20.387
If she's hiding
out here somewhere.

20:23.991 --> 20:26.728
Look, I don't wanna kill
anybody, but I'm done talking.

20:28.930 --> 20:31.364
You have 30 seconds to
get off my property!

20:31.398 --> 20:32.800
That's a little abrupt.

20:40.007 --> 20:40.240
Go.

20:47.915 --> 20:50.785
By the way, the
ranch looks great.

20:50.818 --> 20:52.553
Your father would be proud.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.028
Aaron!

21:06.200 --> 21:07.001
We'll find her.

21:08.301 --> 21:09.771
How do you know that guy?

21:09.804 --> 21:13.574
I know of him
from a former life.

21:13.608 --> 21:17.277
His father was a gambler
indebted to the organization

21:17.310 --> 21:18.278
I worked for.

21:19.046 --> 21:21.015
This is a sign.

21:23.383 --> 21:28.388
Because if death didn't have
a plan for me and that girl

21:29.223 --> 21:31.959
then how did we end up here?

21:31.993 --> 21:34.195
You could taste the
lies coming from him.

21:36.463 --> 21:37.198
She's there.

21:38.566 --> 21:39.934
I'm sure of it.

21:39.967 --> 21:43.303
And we're gonna make him pay
for taking what's rightly ours.

21:43.336 --> 21:45.940
We do
whatever has to be done.

21:45.973 --> 21:47.474
We turn around and go back.

21:50.211 --> 21:51.512
We'll find her.

22:30.017 --> 22:32.419
What do you think?

22:33.287 --> 22:35.156
What?

22:35.189 --> 22:37.024
What do you think?

22:39.126 --> 22:40.427
I think it's a lot of work.

22:40.460 --> 22:43.764
Well, if anyone
can do it, it's you.

22:43.798 --> 22:46.433
Come on, Benny,
it'll be worth it.

22:46.466 --> 22:48.069
How would it be worth it?

22:48.102 --> 22:51.072
You've been out there
in the real world.

22:51.105 --> 22:54.542
Out there everyone is waiting
to take something from ya.

22:54.575 --> 22:56.911
What happens if this
virus thing gets bad

22:56.944 --> 22:58.746
like they're talking?

22:58.779 --> 23:01.215
They're saying manufacturing
might even shut down.

23:03.084 --> 23:04.919
We have to protect the ranch,

23:04.952 --> 23:06.988
we have to protect what's ours.

23:07.989 --> 23:09.991
It's a huge piece of property.

23:11.225 --> 23:13.361
It would take weeks, no months.

23:13.393 --> 23:15.730
What else is there to do?

23:15.763 --> 23:18.599
All I'm asking is to
beef up the fence,

23:18.633 --> 23:21.302
grab some more
guns, I don't know,

23:21.335 --> 23:23.304
build some more
security around here.

23:26.274 --> 23:28.276
Is this about those
guys from the city?

23:28.309 --> 23:31.078
No, it's about us.

23:34.615 --> 23:35.850
I have work to do.

23:36.751 --> 23:38.485
We don't have a lot of time.

23:38.519 --> 23:40.054
We can't trust anybody.

23:40.087 --> 23:41.088
You sound like
you're going crazy.

23:41.122 --> 23:43.124
This land is all we have, Ben.

23:43.157 --> 23:45.159
It's just me and you out here.

23:46.426 --> 23:48.062
I mean, how would you
feel if you didn't do it

23:48.095 --> 23:49.397
and something happened to me?

23:49.429 --> 23:51.265
Oh, Jesus, Dad,
would you stop?

23:52.199 --> 23:53.466
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

23:54.502 --> 23:56.003
You're losing your fucking mind.

23:56.037 --> 23:57.505
What the hell happened?

23:58.639 --> 23:59.807
What do you mean?

23:59.840 --> 24:01.008
What kind of
world do we live in

24:01.042 --> 24:03.611
when a boy don't listen
to his own father

24:03.644 --> 24:06.380
or a boy don't have
respect for his own father?

24:08.182 --> 24:10.284
What am I supposed to respect?

24:12.119 --> 24:15.022
Am I suppose to respect how
you gamble away all your money?

24:15.056 --> 24:16.357
Benny.

24:16.390 --> 24:17.992
Am I supposed to respect
how Mom used to sit up

24:18.025 --> 24:19.360
every night not knowing if
or when you'd come home?

24:19.393 --> 24:20.328
If you were dead in a trash can?

24:20.361 --> 24:22.229
Stop, don't say another word.

24:25.232 --> 24:26.000
Okay, Dad.

24:29.637 --> 24:32.940
You know, you tell me what
I'm supposed to respect

24:32.974 --> 24:34.308
and I'll start respecting it.

24:36.210 --> 24:37.778
I gotta go to work.

24:55.363 --> 24:56.230
Here we go.

25:15.282 --> 25:17.251
Get back inside!

25:17.284 --> 25:18.686
Not a chance.

25:18.719 --> 25:19.987
Hands!

25:20.021 --> 25:21.122
I wanna see hands!

25:29.630 --> 25:32.533
I know you're lying.
Where's the girl?

25:32.566 --> 25:33.734
We can talk about this!

25:33.768 --> 25:35.504
There's nothing to talk about.

25:35.536 --> 25:37.204
Providence brought us here.

25:37.238 --> 25:39.373
And I told you, I
don't have any girl.

25:39.407 --> 25:41.342
I can hear the
lie in your voice.

25:41.375 --> 25:42.643
Like father, like son.

25:43.711 --> 25:46.414
Fuck.

25:46.447 --> 25:47.715
We can barter!

25:47.748 --> 25:49.850
This isn't
exactly a negotiation.

25:49.884 --> 25:51.085
It should be!

25:51.118 --> 25:52.920
Okay, you'd like to barter.

25:52.953 --> 25:55.222
Well, all right, may I go first?

25:55.256 --> 25:56.957
- Ready?
- Ready.

25:56.991 --> 25:58.259
Okay.

25:58.292 --> 26:02.229
You can A, give us the
girl, all your supplies

26:02.263 --> 26:04.665
and let me burn your
ranch to the ground.

26:06.133 --> 26:10.838
Or B, try and fight at
which point we will kill you

26:11.672 --> 26:12.907
and take the girl anyway.

26:14.942 --> 26:16.477
And C?

26:16.511 --> 26:20.181
Uh, A and B are
your only options.

26:21.449 --> 26:23.384
They're pretty limited.

26:23.417 --> 26:25.252
Now you hear me out.

26:25.286 --> 26:26.454
Okay.

26:26.487 --> 26:28.589
Think about the long run.

26:28.622 --> 26:31.225
If we fight we waste
a whole lotta bullets

26:31.258 --> 26:33.661
and we both know they're a
hot commodity around here.

26:33.694 --> 26:34.695
That they are.

26:36.764 --> 26:38.799
I'll trade you
food and supplies

26:38.833 --> 26:40.434
in exchange for you leaving.

26:42.336 --> 26:45.039
We forget this happened
and go our separate ways.

26:46.640 --> 26:48.442
Doesn't work for me.

26:48.476 --> 26:51.178
You see, I am duty
bound to save the earth

26:51.212 --> 26:55.149
from this virus and I
won't let anyone stop me.

26:56.450 --> 27:00.354
So now what's gonna happen is
we're gonna take everything

27:00.387 --> 27:03.691
that you have and then
we're gonna kill you anyway.

27:05.226 --> 27:07.361
Shit!

27:15.504 --> 27:17.638
Fuck!

27:43.264 --> 27:44.732
Oh, God, stop it!

27:46.367 --> 27:49.370
I will bitchslap you
right through that wall.

27:54.543 --> 27:56.777
Your crying isn't
helping anyone.

27:59.380 --> 28:00.247
Jackson is dead!

28:00.281 --> 28:02.750
Yes, he is dead, so grab a gun

28:02.783 --> 28:05.219
and kill the son of
a bitch who did it.

28:05.252 --> 28:06.053
Where's your gun?

28:09.089 --> 28:10.157
Go ahead.

28:12.092 --> 28:12.893
Go!

28:27.374 --> 28:28.375
Stop.

28:28.409 --> 28:29.343
Stop firing.

28:29.376 --> 28:30.377
We're running out of ammo.

28:30.411 --> 28:32.112
Matthew, how much do we have?

28:32.146 --> 28:32.913
Close to out.

28:34.048 --> 28:35.249
So, what are gonna do?

28:35.282 --> 28:37.284
Well, we're not
gonna keep doing this.

28:37.318 --> 28:39.554
Jeez, there are five of
us, there's one of him.

28:39.588 --> 28:41.523
But he has ammo.

28:41.556 --> 28:43.390
Well, then we
make him run out.

28:43.424 --> 28:44.559
Well how do we stop
him from running back

28:44.593 --> 28:45.594
to the house and getting more?

28:45.627 --> 28:46.894
We shoot back.

28:46.927 --> 28:48.929
Not a lot, not more than
one bullet at a time.

28:48.963 --> 28:50.397
Just keep him there.

28:50.431 --> 28:51.465
Until he runs out.

28:51.498 --> 28:52.900
- Exactly.
- And when we run out?

28:52.933 --> 28:54.735
We deal with that
when we get there.

28:54.768 --> 28:56.870
Just worry about
keeping him pinned down.

28:56.904 --> 28:58.272
That's all we have to do.

30:00.568 --> 30:02.369
I hit him.

30:02.403 --> 30:03.437
Fuck!

30:18.553 --> 30:19.721
Fuck you, Heath.

30:24.526 --> 30:27.194
He's running out
of ammo, and if he's hit

30:27.227 --> 30:29.698
we've got him just
where we want him.

30:29.731 --> 30:31.498
At this rate we'll
probably be here till night.

30:31.533 --> 30:32.567
Your point?

30:32.600 --> 30:33.901
By then we
could probably go out

30:33.934 --> 30:35.135
- and find supplies the-
- We're not here for

30:35.169 --> 30:36.236
the supplies.

30:37.539 --> 30:38.506
We're here for the girl.

30:41.576 --> 30:44.144
And if we leave and
that idiot inside starts

30:44.178 --> 30:49.116
telling people that we ran
and then everyone out there

30:50.017 --> 30:50.918
starts to think that we're weak.

30:52.920 --> 30:55.255
And I don't know about
you, but I'm not a fan

30:55.289 --> 30:57.424
of being anyone's bitch.

30:57.458 --> 30:58.359
I'm not either.

30:58.392 --> 30:59.728
He didn't take you in.

30:59.761 --> 31:01.028
He didn't take any of you in

31:01.061 --> 31:02.764
because he thought
you were weak.

31:06.300 --> 31:07.401
Are you weak?

31:08.636 --> 31:10.437
We're gonna take the
girl and we're gonna kill

31:10.471 --> 31:12.607
the rancher and if any
of you think that isn't

31:12.640 --> 31:16.110
what's gonna happen, I
suggest you step outside

31:16.143 --> 31:20.948
the war wagon now and gamble
on who shoots you first.

31:35.095 --> 31:36.130
Thought so.

31:41.770 --> 31:43.437
Oh shit.

32:25.045 --> 32:26.614
Come on.

32:26.648 --> 32:28.650
Come on, you fucker.

32:34.656 --> 32:37.525
- My leg.
- Matthew, get something!

32:42.664 --> 32:43.698
Fuck!

32:48.001 --> 32:49.470
Hurry!

33:22.670 --> 33:23.705
Fuck!

33:30.712 --> 33:32.379
Breathe, Ben.

33:32.412 --> 33:33.848
Fucking breathe.

33:46.594 --> 33:47.394
Fuck.

33:50.965 --> 33:55.870
Fuck.

33:58.305 --> 34:00.274
You can do this.

34:38.679 --> 34:39.478
Just sit.

34:46.853 --> 34:49.757
Oh, fuck.

34:57.297 --> 34:58.098
I'm fine.

35:01.335 --> 35:03.938
Yeah, you look fine.

35:03.972 --> 35:05.640
I mean it.

35:05.673 --> 35:06.541
I'm sure you do.

35:08.108 --> 35:09.510
Let me fix you up anyway.

35:09.544 --> 35:11.679
Just rub some dirt in it.

35:11.713 --> 35:13.380
We both know that's bullshit.

35:16.551 --> 35:17.685
Oh, that's nice.

35:21.556 --> 35:24.424
I'm sorry, does it sting?

35:24.458 --> 35:25.225
Like hell.

35:26.060 --> 35:26.828
Good.

35:28.963 --> 35:29.831
It's what you get.

35:29.864 --> 35:31.666
No, not now, Ben.

35:32.967 --> 35:35.135
Actually, I can't
think of a better time.

35:39.641 --> 35:41.009
All right.

35:41.042 --> 35:45.513
Let's hear it.

35:45.546 --> 35:47.749
How many times have
I told you to stop?

35:48.750 --> 35:50.450
How many?

35:52.687 --> 35:54.022
How many?

35:54.055 --> 35:55.023
Too many.

35:55.823 --> 35:56.858
Too many.

35:57.992 --> 35:59.292
How many times
have I asked you

35:59.326 --> 36:01.629
to add some more
security around here?

36:01.663 --> 36:02.864
Why?

36:02.897 --> 36:04.732
Because of all the ass
beatings you're taking?

36:04.766 --> 36:06.668
It's not that simple, Ben.

36:08.770 --> 36:10.104
But it is that simple.

36:11.606 --> 36:12.406
Ben.

36:16.243 --> 36:17.045
Dad.

36:19.246 --> 36:20.048
Dad.

36:21.115 --> 36:23.051
Look at me, look at me.

36:25.119 --> 36:28.790
I'm glad you're home and
I'm glad you're safe.

36:32.694 --> 36:33.861
I gotta lock up outside.

36:48.308 --> 36:49.877
Rub some dirt in it.

36:52.647 --> 36:53.881
Asshole.

37:14.301 --> 37:15.603
I'm gonna need your help.

37:20.407 --> 37:21.876
Wake up!

37:21.909 --> 37:22.944
Hey!

37:22.977 --> 37:24.979
I need you to wake up!

37:25.913 --> 37:28.015
I need you to wake up.

37:30.250 --> 37:31.018
Shit.

37:56.944 --> 37:58.146
Come on, baby.

38:38.553 --> 38:40.555
Have you seen him?

38:40.588 --> 38:41.388
Nope.

38:42.924 --> 38:45.159
Great, so now he's
out there somewhere

38:45.193 --> 38:46.160
with a ton of ammo.

38:47.695 --> 38:50.231
You're assuming he has
ammo, you don't know that.

38:50.264 --> 38:53.134
Then we need a plan, we need
to walk through our options.

38:53.167 --> 38:54.202
Now you're thinking.

38:55.570 --> 38:57.038
He's holed up in
one of those buildings

38:57.071 --> 38:58.673
with nowhere to go.

38:58.706 --> 39:00.908
We could storm in there and
pretend our guns are loaded.

39:00.942 --> 39:03.177
Any smart man would
surrender right then.

39:05.412 --> 39:07.915
What happens if
he shoots back?

39:07.949 --> 39:09.550
Why don't we sneak in there
instead of storm in there?

39:09.584 --> 39:11.152
Don't you think
he's watching us?

39:11.185 --> 39:12.452
John, he's smarter than that.

39:15.690 --> 39:18.860
So if we leave the war wagon
we'll most likely be shot.

39:18.893 --> 39:21.428
Right, and if we
stay in the war wagon

39:21.461 --> 39:23.030
we're gonna run outta
supplies and starve

39:23.064 --> 39:25.833
or he's just gonna come
down here and kill us.

39:25.867 --> 39:29.103
We wait until nightfall, we
could sneak up to the house,

39:29.136 --> 39:31.038
storm in, take him by force.

39:31.072 --> 39:33.107
Or you just don't
be chicken shits.

39:35.375 --> 39:39.013
What we need to do is
just go in right now

39:39.046 --> 39:42.550
and shoot this fucker
of mothers in the face.

39:43.985 --> 39:46.287
We tracked this girl for weeks.

39:47.889 --> 39:51.458
It was destiny that brought us
here to start the world anew.

39:51.491 --> 39:53.961
With her blood she will breed

39:53.995 --> 39:57.397
and her children will be immune.

39:57.430 --> 40:02.136
And they will speak of us as
the people who saved humanity.

40:03.403 --> 40:05.973
You're just being tested.

40:06.007 --> 40:07.141
You're being tested.

40:07.174 --> 40:09.310
Shit, I am being tested.

40:11.746 --> 40:16.017
And I have to ask you, are you
ready to embrace your destiny

40:17.484 --> 40:22.123
or do you wanna be just another
stain in this dying world?

40:24.091 --> 40:27.295
I was led to you
and you saved me.

40:27.328 --> 40:28.663
I'm not turning back now.

40:31.198 --> 40:32.499
I'm not going anywhere.

40:33.968 --> 40:36.270
Let's show that asshole
who he's dealing with.

40:39.707 --> 40:40.875
You're my family now.

40:43.044 --> 40:44.345
You know I would die for you.

40:50.618 --> 40:54.155
The greatest expression
of love is death.

41:27.054 --> 41:27.922
Get back.

41:31.659 --> 41:33.294
Get us in there
as far as you can

41:33.327 --> 41:34.195
and then we charge.

41:34.228 --> 41:35.129
What about the barricade?

41:35.162 --> 41:36.063
Fuck the barricade!

41:36.097 --> 41:37.398
Do it, Matthew!

41:37.431 --> 41:38.933
Jackson wouldn't of
died for nothing!

41:39.867 --> 41:40.668
Fuck off.

41:43.337 --> 41:45.840
You're in my house.

41:45.873 --> 41:46.674
Who are you?

41:46.707 --> 41:48.242
Why did you come here?

41:50.344 --> 41:54.081
I'm Guy's sister, Sarah,
and I'm in your house

41:54.115 --> 41:56.417
because my brother told me
that you would protect us.

41:56.450 --> 41:58.786
Well your brother
is full of shit.

42:00.021 --> 42:01.455
You wanna know what
I did at the FBI?

42:03.024 --> 42:03.791
Maps.

42:06.227 --> 42:09.230
I teach agents how to read maps.

42:11.132 --> 42:12.733
Who did you think I was?

42:22.643 --> 42:24.345
They found me.

42:24.378 --> 42:25.946
Come on!

42:39.393 --> 42:40.728
Don't let them take me.

42:51.972 --> 42:53.374
Put that away.

42:53.407 --> 42:54.575
Follow me, now.

42:58.479 --> 43:03.417
Go, go, go!

43:03.451 --> 43:04.251
Not you.

43:06.287 --> 43:07.321
Not on that leg.

43:08.656 --> 43:10.658
How much ammo you have left?

43:10.691 --> 43:12.326
Enough to kill
him if I see him.

43:13.761 --> 43:14.529
Good.

43:15.463 --> 43:16.263
Marley.

43:18.599 --> 43:20.000
You're my right hand.

43:21.202 --> 43:22.770
My work is your work.

43:23.971 --> 43:25.039
Bring her back to me.

43:27.808 --> 43:28.776
Anything for you.

43:50.064 --> 43:52.032
They've broken
through the barricades.

43:54.468 --> 43:55.870
Get into the basement.

43:55.903 --> 43:58.607
Stay quiet and lock the door.

44:28.402 --> 44:30.037
Do you see anything?

44:30.070 --> 44:30.838
No.

44:32.574 --> 44:33.707
He's here somewhere.

44:39.780 --> 44:41.348
Owen, Matthew, come with me.

44:41.382 --> 44:44.385
John, check that house.

45:32.933 --> 45:37.938
I saw on TV that virus
is killing a lot of people.

45:39.073 --> 45:40.274
Lotta countries
closing their borders.

45:41.108 --> 45:41.909
Yep.

45:51.151 --> 45:53.854
Another new reason for you
not to go into the city, okay?

45:58.492 --> 46:01.128
I ain't seen a deer
around here in weeks.

46:01.161 --> 46:02.863
Maybe it's a deer virus.

46:06.668 --> 46:09.504
Well, if we can't
kill one for dinner

46:09.537 --> 46:11.673
maybe I'll go into
town and buy one.

46:14.609 --> 46:17.778
I just told you you need
to stop going into the city.

46:19.346 --> 46:22.916
I said town, just down
the road to the market.

46:22.950 --> 46:24.519
It's a venison kinda night.

46:28.789 --> 46:32.359
If you insist, if that's
the case, I'll drive.

46:32.393 --> 46:35.496
No, really, Ben, I
owe you for patching

46:35.530 --> 46:36.531
me up the other night.

46:36.564 --> 46:38.432
Oh no, I insist.

46:38.465 --> 46:39.366
A little father-son bonding.

46:39.400 --> 46:41.302
We can bond here over dinner.

46:41.335 --> 46:42.537
You're in no shape
to drive, Heath.

46:42.570 --> 46:45.540
Just let me go as a thank you.

46:45.573 --> 46:47.975
You know, I can't
think of the last time

46:48.008 --> 46:49.678
you bought venison
as a thank you.

46:49.711 --> 46:51.345
Usually we kill 'em ourselves.

46:51.378 --> 46:53.682
Well maybe if we sit
here longer, try harder.

46:53.715 --> 46:55.949
We've sat here
long enough already.

46:55.983 --> 46:57.217
Dad...

46:57.251 --> 47:00.622
I mean, we can't
sit here all day.

47:00.655 --> 47:01.690
- It'll be quicker-
- Dad!

47:05.225 --> 47:06.761
Stop lying.

47:08.429 --> 47:09.229
Lie?

47:10.431 --> 47:11.965
Just trying to do
something nice.

47:11.999 --> 47:13.867
Oh God, you're so
full of shit it's coming

47:13.901 --> 47:16.337
out your fucking eyeballs.

47:16.370 --> 47:17.471
I'm telling the truth.

47:17.505 --> 47:20.542
The market doesn't
sell venison, Dad!

47:25.379 --> 47:26.447
I'm tired of this.

47:28.616 --> 47:29.684
I'm your son.

47:30.951 --> 47:34.556
I'm not your babysitter and
I ain't your fucking sponsor.

47:34.589 --> 47:37.592
If you keep this up, you're
gonna lose this place.

47:38.560 --> 47:42.664
If you lose this ranch,
you lose everything.

47:42.697 --> 47:46.200
And not just our home, you
lose everything Grandma

47:46.233 --> 47:48.536
and Grandpa ever worked for.

47:48.570 --> 47:50.871
I lose all my
childhood memories,

47:50.904 --> 47:53.575
all my good memories
with you and Mom.

47:55.943 --> 47:58.613
You wanna talk about
Grandma and Grandpa?

47:58.646 --> 47:59.913
Yes!

47:59.947 --> 48:02.049
Well let's talk
about them, huh?

48:03.217 --> 48:05.854
Where were you
when Grandma died?

48:05.886 --> 48:07.187
And what about Grandpa?

48:07.221 --> 48:08.288
Where were you, Ben?

48:08.322 --> 48:09.591
Fuck you.

48:09.624 --> 48:12.459
Don't tell me about loss,
I sat here and watched

48:12.493 --> 48:14.895
- my parents die.
- I was working!

48:16.163 --> 48:17.732
I had a job!

48:18.499 --> 48:20.467
You knew I couldn't leave.

48:20.501 --> 48:22.469
Do you know why you knew?

48:22.504 --> 48:24.471
Because one of us had
to be the grownup.

48:24.506 --> 48:26.641
Since when does growing
up meaning turning

48:26.674 --> 48:28.942
your back on your family?

48:30.678 --> 48:32.112
Turning my back on my family?

48:36.984 --> 48:37.786
My family?

48:40.487 --> 48:42.089
Where were you when Mom died?

48:45.860 --> 48:48.863
- I was-
- You were fucking gambling!

48:51.533 --> 48:53.434
You were gambling!

48:53.467 --> 48:54.803
It's not the same.

48:54.836 --> 48:58.972
Of course it's not the same
because you have a disease.

49:04.779 --> 49:06.313
I'd never turn my back on you.

49:07.715 --> 49:09.784
If I did, I wouldn't be here.

49:15.189 --> 49:16.791
You wanna do this to yourself?

49:17.826 --> 49:19.359
Then you just go right ahead.

49:21.395 --> 49:22.697
I can't do it anymore.

49:24.231 --> 49:26.967
If I do, I'm gonna have a
heart attack just like Mom.

49:29.470 --> 49:32.206
I'm done wasting my
energy trying to stop you.

49:35.677 --> 49:37.010
It's up to you, Heath.

50:35.737 --> 50:39.306
I'll do the barns,
check the deer blind.

50:40.742 --> 50:42.075
Shoot that bastard.

52:03.791 --> 52:05.860
You're fucking dead.

52:40.327 --> 52:41.729
No sign of him or the girl.

52:41.763 --> 52:42.997
Was that just
sitting up there?

52:43.031 --> 52:44.999
Yeah, there's
another one up there.

52:46.000 --> 52:47.535
Based on what I've seen
I wouldn't be shocked

52:47.568 --> 52:50.138
if there's weapons hidden
all over this place.

52:56.577 --> 52:58.780
Go sit in the blind, you
see him, you start firing.

52:59.781 --> 53:01.348
We'll come running.

53:01.381 --> 53:02.182
And you?

53:03.785 --> 53:05.553
I'm gonna take a
walk in the woods

53:05.586 --> 53:07.155
and see what I can find.

53:07.187 --> 53:08.756
All right.

53:08.790 --> 53:10.223
Good luck.

53:10.257 --> 53:11.059
You, too.

56:59.787 --> 57:00.988
You can come out now.

57:12.934 --> 57:13.768
You did that?

57:19.340 --> 57:20.608
Why do they want you?

57:23.945 --> 57:26.314
They think I can
somehow save them.

57:32.219 --> 57:33.955
Their leader, he...

57:34.989 --> 57:36.023
He wants to breed me.

57:50.838 --> 57:52.673
I gotta put some
lights on outside.

57:54.175 --> 57:55.176
It's gonna be dark soon.

57:58.079 --> 58:00.047
It's gonna be a long night.

58:06.921 --> 58:10.524
You know, I don't think
you're lying to me,

58:13.828 --> 58:16.330
but you're definitely not
telling me everything.

58:18.432 --> 58:20.067
Think about how that helps us.

59:06.547 --> 59:08.249
I know your footsteps.

59:10.251 --> 59:13.721
In a pride of lions
the female does most,

59:13.754 --> 59:15.256
if not all the hunting.

59:15.289 --> 59:16.824
Do know how a male lion hunts?

59:18.225 --> 59:19.226
No.

59:19.260 --> 59:20.795
Okay, I'll tell ya.

59:20.828 --> 59:25.366
He sits on his ass in
the brush and he waits

59:25.399 --> 59:27.168
for the prey to come to him.

59:28.402 --> 59:30.604
I am the male lion.

59:30.638 --> 59:32.339
I am the king of the jungle.

59:34.241 --> 59:35.843
I just wanted to check on you.

59:37.578 --> 59:38.345
I'll go.

59:39.814 --> 59:42.416
You need to get this
done, it's taking too long.

59:43.317 --> 59:46.420
I know it's a big ranch,
but he's out there,

59:46.454 --> 59:48.089
Marley, and so is she.

59:49.490 --> 59:51.560
He knows where to hide.

59:51.592 --> 59:53.627
There are four of
you and one of him.

59:55.296 --> 59:56.531
You disappoint me.

59:59.667 --> 01:00:00.968
I'm sorry.

01:00:01.001 --> 01:00:03.771
Don't be sorry,
that's for the weak.

01:00:03.804 --> 01:00:04.672
You're not weak.

01:00:06.273 --> 01:00:08.442
You go out there and do what
you have to do, get it done.

01:00:09.477 --> 01:00:10.644
Make me proud.

01:00:15.182 --> 01:00:15.983
I will.

01:01:10.004 --> 01:01:12.206
No, no, no, no.

01:01:12.239 --> 01:01:13.040
Shit.

01:01:23.684 --> 01:01:24.451
Ben.

01:01:27.522 --> 01:01:28.289
What?

01:01:38.265 --> 01:01:39.733
I have the virus.

01:01:46.373 --> 01:01:47.107
What?

01:01:53.948 --> 01:01:55.482
They don't know.

01:01:56.417 --> 01:01:57.451
No.

01:02:02.557 --> 01:02:03.592
They think I'm
immune, but I'm not.

01:02:04.892 --> 01:02:06.961
I'm a carrier, I
just don't get sick.

01:02:14.468 --> 01:02:16.337
The refugee camp
in Pennsylvania.

01:02:18.005 --> 01:02:21.909
That was you.

01:02:21.942 --> 01:02:23.143
That was me.

01:02:27.014 --> 01:02:28.148
All those people.

01:02:28.182 --> 01:02:29.750
I didn't know what I was.

01:02:29.783 --> 01:02:33.020
I showed up and everyone
started getting sick.

01:02:35.322 --> 01:02:36.957
They were all dying
except for me.

01:02:43.097 --> 01:02:46.166
The doctors couldn't
tell people that

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:49.370
they messed up by letting
me in, so they hid it.

01:02:51.372 --> 01:02:54.308
They told everyone I was immune
and everyone believed it.

01:02:55.943 --> 01:02:57.144
They threw me in
a quarantine cell

01:02:57.177 --> 01:02:58.812
and said that they
were gonna send me off

01:02:58.846 --> 01:03:00.047
to some research place.

01:03:01.982 --> 01:03:03.183
But I've heard stories.

01:03:04.719 --> 01:03:07.522
You don't know what they
do to people like me.

01:03:07.555 --> 01:03:12.493
They experiment, it's like
being a fucking rat in a cage

01:03:12.527 --> 01:03:13.961
waiting to be dissected.

01:03:16.665 --> 01:03:18.465
Was your brother
Guy a carrier?

01:03:19.534 --> 01:03:22.704
He was sick and
helped me escape.

01:03:24.204 --> 01:03:26.508
Neither one of us knew
how long he would make it.

01:03:33.682 --> 01:03:34.683
Am I sick?

01:03:39.654 --> 01:03:40.689
I don't know.

01:04:14.922 --> 01:04:16.390
I'll see who it is.

01:04:18.292 --> 01:04:19.460
- Ben-
- Go on.

01:04:21.095 --> 01:04:21.895
Go on.

01:04:23.397 --> 01:04:24.398
All right.

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:34.576
What do you want?

01:04:34.609 --> 01:04:35.876
What we always want.

01:04:37.311 --> 01:04:38.879
You
shouldn't of come here.

01:04:44.753 --> 01:04:46.788
Heath, we came to collect.

01:04:47.655 --> 01:04:49.624
I just need more time.

01:04:49.657 --> 01:04:50.924
You've had
more than enough.

01:04:50.958 --> 01:04:53.795
Just a little
more, I'm so close.

01:04:53.828 --> 01:04:55.062
Close?

01:04:55.095 --> 01:04:56.096
Is that a joke?

01:04:57.632 --> 01:04:58.733
Close? Hear that?

01:04:59.601 --> 01:05:01.301
You owe us more money every time

01:05:01.335 --> 01:05:02.771
you set foot outside that house.

01:05:02.804 --> 01:05:06.508
- I understand, but-
- Do you have it?

01:05:09.644 --> 01:05:10.812
Well then why don't we
see if there's anything

01:05:10.845 --> 01:05:12.279
more valuable inside?

01:05:12.312 --> 01:05:13.848
Not in the house!

01:05:18.085 --> 01:05:19.587
What are you doing, Heath?

01:05:22.189 --> 01:05:23.691
Get out of my way.

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:28.395
Hey!

01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:37.572
Dad!

01:05:37.605 --> 01:05:38.640
Dad!

01:05:38.673 --> 01:05:39.808
Hey!

01:05:42.009 --> 01:05:42.811
Hey!

01:05:45.212 --> 01:05:47.314
Don't come back!

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:01.355
It's not your fault.

01:07:04.124 --> 01:07:05.459
It's nobody's fault.

01:07:08.061 --> 01:07:10.330
It's just the way it is.

01:07:23.477 --> 01:07:24.579
Hide.

01:07:24.612 --> 01:07:25.412
Now.

01:07:34.722 --> 01:07:36.123
Where are you?

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:01.281
I got you.

01:08:33.548 --> 01:08:34.348
Come on.

01:10:04.404 --> 01:10:06.040
I know she's here!

01:10:26.961 --> 01:10:28.896
14 people are dead,

01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:30.131
including three children.

01:10:30.164 --> 01:10:32.399
Four others suffered
serious injuries.

01:10:32.432 --> 01:10:33.868
Police have a suspect in custody

01:10:33.901 --> 01:10:35.703
but are not releasing
any information

01:10:35.737 --> 01:10:37.939
until they complete
their investigation.

01:10:37.972 --> 01:10:39.607
Health officials
from around the world

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:41.876
met virtually today
seeking to unite

01:10:41.909 --> 01:10:44.045
all their resources
as the worldwide

01:10:44.078 --> 01:10:46.446
death toll now tops eight...

01:10:47.682 --> 01:10:49.050
To suppress
the mass looting

01:10:49.083 --> 01:10:51.919
the president sought to
order martial law in effect,

01:10:51.953 --> 01:10:54.055
but with more than 2/3rds
of the country's military

01:10:54.088 --> 01:10:56.456
and law enforcement
officers sick...

01:11:21.448 --> 01:11:22.917
Good evening, darlings.

01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:26.521
This is the new Doomsday
Daily and I'm still learning

01:11:26.554 --> 01:11:29.157
how to operate this
radio along with catching

01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:30.925
all the relays
across the country,

01:11:30.958 --> 01:11:34.595
so I'm coming to you from
somewhere in the heartland.

01:11:34.629 --> 01:11:38.166
So if you can hear me, I just
might be able to see you.

01:11:39.466 --> 01:11:42.970
It's been a brutal 24
hours, so let's forego

01:11:43.004 --> 01:11:45.206
the witty alliterative banter.

01:11:47.008 --> 01:11:48.709
The president has died.

01:11:50.077 --> 01:11:52.180
There's just no more government.

01:11:53.981 --> 01:11:55.049
He was the last.

01:11:56.551 --> 01:11:59.319
There is no longer anybody
running this country.

01:12:00.555 --> 01:12:02.924
I'm not sure what else
to report as we're all

01:12:04.192 --> 01:12:06.994
just figuring this out, but
I'm just gonna keep coming back

01:12:07.028 --> 01:12:08.229
for as long as I can.

01:12:08.262 --> 01:12:11.032
This is Alpha One-Nine.

01:12:11.065 --> 01:12:12.166
You know what?

01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:14.635
This is Jessica.

01:12:14.669 --> 01:12:16.037
Goodnight, darlings.

01:13:06.087 --> 01:13:07.655
You're never
gonna get that girl.

01:13:18.332 --> 01:13:20.234
You're never gonna get my land.

01:13:47.528 --> 01:13:52.432
You come to my house, you
try to kidnap this girl,

01:13:52.465 --> 01:13:53.167
and then you try to kill me?

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:55.136
Just wanted the girl!

01:14:00.274 --> 01:14:01.409
No.

01:14:04.312 --> 01:14:06.180
No, wait, wait!

01:14:06.213 --> 01:14:07.214
Wait!

01:14:08.382 --> 01:14:10.084
No, no, no, don't.

01:14:15.289 --> 01:14:16.456
No.

01:14:16.489 --> 01:14:17.692
Oh no, no, no.

01:14:33.708 --> 01:14:35.142
Don't do this.

01:14:38.212 --> 01:14:39.046
I don't have a choice.

01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:40.480
Yes, you do.

01:14:42.683 --> 01:14:43.751
She's not immune.

01:14:48.723 --> 01:14:50.558
The girl is sick.

01:14:50.591 --> 01:14:52.727
Hell, at this point, so am I.

01:15:05.106 --> 01:15:10.011
I have to kill you
or Aaron kills me.

01:15:10.044 --> 01:15:12.847
You can run, you can
head into those woods

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:14.215
and don't you ever look back.

01:15:26.627 --> 01:15:27.962
It's too late for that.

01:16:21.282 --> 01:16:23.484
We're gonna go for a walk.

01:16:23.518 --> 01:16:25.953
You try anything,
you try to run,

01:16:27.088 --> 01:16:28.622
I swear by sweet
and sainty Jesus

01:16:28.656 --> 01:16:30.658
I'll put a bullet in your head.

01:16:30.691 --> 01:16:34.295
Get up!

01:16:34.328 --> 01:16:35.362
Come on!

01:16:37.765 --> 01:16:38.533
Move!

01:16:50.044 --> 01:16:51.846
Oh, my God.

01:16:51.879 --> 01:16:53.280
Well, look at us.

01:16:58.553 --> 01:17:00.454
Let's be done with this.

01:17:02.389 --> 01:17:04.825
No, we have to talk
before we're finished.

01:17:04.859 --> 01:17:06.961
We have nothing else to say.

01:17:06.994 --> 01:17:08.929
You're gonna toss
that gun aside,

01:17:08.963 --> 01:17:10.197
I'm gonna give you
your lady back,

01:17:10.231 --> 01:17:11.499
you're gonna get into that truck

01:17:11.533 --> 01:17:13.701
and you're gonna ride
off into the sunset.

01:17:13.734 --> 01:17:16.605
Ah, happily ever after?

01:17:16.637 --> 01:17:18.305
- That's the idea.
- Uh huh.

01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:21.041
Well, let's think through that.

01:17:21.075 --> 01:17:25.312
So, I toss my gun,
you let her go,

01:17:26.515 --> 01:17:28.449
and how do you think
that would end?

01:17:28.482 --> 01:17:31.051
I mean, two people who've
been trying to kill

01:17:31.085 --> 01:17:34.355
you all day long standing
in front of you defenseless,

01:17:34.388 --> 01:17:35.656
we'd be dead in seconds.

01:17:35.689 --> 01:17:36.891
I see how that looks.

01:17:38.259 --> 01:17:40.394
I'll throw my gun
as soon as you do.

01:17:40.427 --> 01:17:41.630
You have my word.

01:17:41.662 --> 01:17:44.298
Your word doesn't
mean anything to me

01:17:44.331 --> 01:17:47.368
because I've been ordained
by the other world

01:17:47.401 --> 01:17:49.336
to kill anyone who
stands in my way.

01:17:49.370 --> 01:17:51.972
I don't want this!

01:17:52.006 --> 01:17:53.340
I'm not a killer!

01:17:53.374 --> 01:17:55.676
I think today you
earned that moniker.

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:03.484
And now you're standing
with a gun to Marley's head

01:18:03.518 --> 01:18:06.353
and you expect me
just to walk away?

01:18:06.387 --> 01:18:09.490
Yeah, I guess I do.

01:18:09.524 --> 01:18:11.258
Yeah, I guess you can see
that's not gonna happen.

01:18:11.292 --> 01:18:13.060
I didn't ask you to come here!

01:18:13.961 --> 01:18:15.362
Doesn't matter now, son.

01:18:15.396 --> 01:18:16.263
Look around you!

01:18:17.464 --> 01:18:19.333
I've already won!

01:18:19.366 --> 01:18:22.537
Toss your gun, cut your
losses, and go home!

01:18:24.038 --> 01:18:25.339
Stop!

01:18:25.372 --> 01:18:26.541
Just out of common courtesy,

01:18:26.575 --> 01:18:28.042
do you mind taking off her gag?

01:18:28.075 --> 01:18:30.477
I think she has some
wisdom to impart.

01:18:32.547 --> 01:18:33.280
Fuck you.

01:18:35.316 --> 01:18:36.717
Hey, Marley,
how's it going?

01:18:42.423 --> 01:18:44.124
I have had better days.

01:18:47.428 --> 01:18:50.331
Boys, I think we're
at a stalemate here.

01:18:52.567 --> 01:18:55.102
And the only thing
killing anyone is old age.

01:18:57.438 --> 01:19:01.576
The only prize is still
hiding somewhere on this land!

01:19:03.911 --> 01:19:06.615
See, we've been after her
ever since she left the camp.

01:19:08.617 --> 01:19:10.150
It was always about the girl.

01:19:10.184 --> 01:19:11.318
But you're wrong
about the girl!

01:19:11.352 --> 01:19:13.053
No!

01:19:13.087 --> 01:19:17.424
She's immune and Aaron
sees the big picture.

01:19:17.458 --> 01:19:21.395
He knows that she could
change everything.

01:19:21.428 --> 01:19:23.097
But she's not immune!

01:19:23.130 --> 01:19:25.432
That's a lie they
told you at the camp.

01:19:25.466 --> 01:19:27.968
She's a carrier and she
will infect you both!

01:19:28.936 --> 01:19:30.170
You're a liar.

01:19:30.204 --> 01:19:32.172
You expect us to believe that?

01:19:32.206 --> 01:19:33.907
Well, you better believe it!

01:19:33.941 --> 01:19:36.777
Because right now I'm breathing
all over your lady's face.

01:19:36.810 --> 01:19:39.514
And if I'm sick,
then she is too.

01:19:46.655 --> 01:19:49.023
I can smell your lies.

01:19:49.056 --> 01:19:52.026
I walked straight through
that disease, son,

01:19:52.059 --> 01:19:53.827
and came out alive.

01:19:55.462 --> 01:19:59.500
The girl is my right,
she is my destiny.

01:19:59.534 --> 01:20:02.803
But your destiny is
gonna get you killed.

01:20:02.836 --> 01:20:05.540
She is mine and
I'm taking her.

01:20:12.012 --> 01:20:13.515
Don't do it.

01:20:13.548 --> 01:20:14.549
Aaron.

01:20:16.518 --> 01:20:18.352
I've told you time and
again that I would do

01:20:18.385 --> 01:20:21.388
whatever it took to end
this and get her back.

01:20:22.489 --> 01:20:23.257
You did.

01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:28.195
And I have kept my promise
until now, haven't I?

01:20:31.231 --> 01:20:31.999
You have.

01:20:39.239 --> 01:20:41.075
Then you do what
you need to do.

01:20:43.611 --> 01:20:44.378
I will.

01:21:25.553 --> 01:21:26.588
Fuck.

01:21:29.156 --> 01:21:31.526
Come on, come on, come on.

01:21:43.237 --> 01:21:44.938
I had this thought
that when I got it

01:21:44.972 --> 01:21:46.940
it would be the virus
that took me down,

01:21:47.842 --> 01:21:50.678
not some dumbass with a gun.

01:21:51.979 --> 01:21:55.650
Sorry to break it to you,
this isn't how it ends.

01:22:05.325 --> 01:22:07.961
You're gonna have to live
with what you've done.

01:22:16.671 --> 01:22:17.438
What I've done?

01:22:17.471 --> 01:22:18.773
I beat death again!

01:22:23.977 --> 01:22:24.779
I'm invincible!

01:22:48.570 --> 01:22:49.704
He killed Guy.

01:22:52.674 --> 01:22:54.241
He would've done this again.

01:22:55.476 --> 01:22:58.646
I couldn't let him do
this to another person.

01:23:17.231 --> 01:23:18.833
I'm so sorry, Ben.

01:23:20.668 --> 01:23:22.102
I'm sorry this happened to you.

01:23:23.671 --> 01:23:25.105
Don't apologize ever.

01:23:30.512 --> 01:23:31.278
Are you okay?

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:34.047
I've been better.

01:23:41.054 --> 01:23:45.693
I always figured if the
world ended we'd band together

01:23:46.861 --> 01:23:48.462
and help each other and...

01:23:51.131 --> 01:23:52.634
I don't know what to do now.

01:23:53.968 --> 01:23:55.202
I don't have anyone.

01:23:59.439 --> 01:24:00.542
We have each other.

01:24:03.912 --> 01:24:05.647
We do have one
thing going for us.

01:24:06.881 --> 01:24:09.216
Yeah? What's that?

01:24:12.486 --> 01:24:14.722
An armored truck with
a tank full of gas.

01:24:17.892 --> 01:24:18.660
Yeah.

01:24:25.733 --> 01:24:27.969
It's time I leave this place.

01:24:30.237 --> 01:24:32.472
Maybe someone out there's
working on a cure.

01:24:37.244 --> 01:24:39.079
You'll need help
if you're sick.

01:24:40.682 --> 01:24:42.784
Are you coming with me?

01:24:44.117 --> 01:24:47.622
You shouldn't go
out there on your own.

01:24:49.356 --> 01:24:52.026
You got any supplies
we can take?

01:24:53.928 --> 01:24:54.696
Yeah.

01:24:56.798 --> 01:24:58.666
We'll be fine.

01:25:16.170 --> 01:25:21.170
