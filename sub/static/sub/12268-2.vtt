WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:02.536
PREVIOUSLY ON "REVENGE"...

00:02.570 --> 00:03.703
YOUR MOTHER'S ALIVE.

00:03.737 --> 00:05.073
I'M GONNA FIND OUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.

00:05.106 --> 00:06.474
YOUR BLOOD WORK--
IT'S POSITIVE FOR HYDROCODONE.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.076
NO, STOP IT. DAD, YOU'RE TRYING
TO KEEP ME LOCKED UP.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.243
EMILY!

00:09.277 --> 00:10.411
(lowered voice) CATSKILLS.

00:10.444 --> 00:11.579
(Emily) VICTORIA'S ALIVE.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.114
I NEED TO GET
A CAMERA IN THERE.

00:13.147 --> 00:14.415
CLAM CAM. I LIKE IT.

00:14.448 --> 00:16.117
(Emily) CHARLOTTE BELIEVES
THERE'S A CONSPIRACY

00:16.149 --> 00:17.285
TO KEEP HER LOCKED UP.

00:17.318 --> 00:20.054
CONRAD IS TRYING TO GET
CONTROL OF HER INHERITANCE.

00:20.088 --> 00:22.123
ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE
THE BABY'S YOURS?

00:22.156 --> 00:24.492
(Takeda) YOU THINK YOU CAN
SUCCEED WHERE I HAVE NOT.

00:24.525 --> 00:27.027
I WON'T ALLOW HER TO MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKE I DID.

00:27.061 --> 00:28.329
ELIMINATE THE LIABILITY.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.531
THEY'RE COMING FOR YOU.

00:30.564 --> 00:33.634
(Inxs) * DON'T ASK ME

00:33.667 --> 00:37.138
* WHAT YOU KNOW IS TRUE

00:37.171 --> 00:41.275
* DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU

00:41.309 --> 00:43.544
(Emily) FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE
 IN RESURRECTION...

00:43.577 --> 00:45.045
(singing along to radio)
* PRECIOUS HEART

00:45.079 --> 00:47.315
DEATH IS INCONSEQUENTIAL.

00:47.348 --> 00:50.451
IT IS NOT AN ENDING,

00:50.484 --> 00:52.019
BUT RATHER A NEW BEGINNING...

00:52.052 --> 00:53.421
* YOU WERE THERE

00:53.454 --> 00:56.023
A SECOND CHANCE.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.558
* TWO WORLDS COLLIDED

00:57.591 --> 00:59.227
A REUNION.

00:59.260 --> 01:03.297
* AND THEY COULD NEVER
TEAR US APART *

01:03.331 --> 01:06.600
(slaps steering wheel
rhythmically)

01:06.634 --> 01:10.471
COME ON.
MY VOICE ISN'T THAT BAD.

01:10.504 --> 01:13.441
DADDY SAID YOU WERE SICK.

01:13.474 --> 01:17.545
I'M ALL BETTER
NOW THAT I'M WITH YOU.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.613
WHERE IS DADDY?

01:19.647 --> 01:22.516
OH, DON'T WORRY, BABY.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.118
WE'RE ON VACATION.

01:24.152 --> 01:26.420
BUT THE VERY IDEA
 OF RESURRECTION

01:26.454 --> 01:30.424
IS SO SEDUCTIVE A CONCEPT,
 IT'S EASY TO FORGET--

01:30.458 --> 01:32.626
BEFORE YOU CAN RISE
 FROM THE DEAD...

01:32.660 --> 01:35.163
(voices fuse) YOU HAVE TO SPEND
 A FEW DAYS IN HELL.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.597
(Nolan) EMS. COME ON. WAKE UP.

01:36.630 --> 01:39.167
(strained voice) BAD DREAM?

01:39.200 --> 01:40.334
(sighs)

01:40.368 --> 01:41.769
(thud)

01:41.802 --> 01:44.405
DON'T DO THAT AGAIN.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.106
(normal voice) THIS IS WHY

01:46.140 --> 01:48.409
YOU SHOULDN'T FALL ASLEEP
WATCHING HORROR MOVIES.

01:48.442 --> 01:51.412
I FELL ASLEEP
MONITORING VICTORIA.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.314
EXACTLY.

01:53.347 --> 01:55.616
DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S A LITTLE BIT... DANGEROUS

01:55.649 --> 01:58.152
TO BE CATNAPPING
OUT IN THE OPEN?

01:58.186 --> 02:02.556
OR ARE YOU ACTUALLY BAITING
THE WHITE-HAIRED MANNIBAL LECTER

02:02.590 --> 02:03.724
TO COME FOR YOU?

02:03.757 --> 02:05.125
HE'S NOT GONNA KILL ME.

02:05.159 --> 02:07.127
OH, REALLY?
DID HE PINKIE SWEAR?

02:07.161 --> 02:09.096
(sighs)

02:09.128 --> 02:11.865
VICTORIA WAS LYING ABOUT
WORKING WITH THE GOVERNMENT

02:11.899 --> 02:13.467
TO BRING DOWN C(beep)

02:13.501 --> 02:15.169
WHATEVER SHE'S PLANNING,

02:15.203 --> 02:17.238
IT HAS TO
INVOLVE CHARLOTTE SOMEHOW.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.872
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,
CHARLOTTE'S IN LOCKDOWN

02:18.906 --> 02:22.543
AT DR. DOOM'S SOBER HOUSE.

02:25.213 --> 02:27.248
NOT FOR LONG.

02:32.753 --> 02:35.723
MORNING, LOVE.

02:35.756 --> 02:39.427
CARE TO JOIN ME FOR
A QUICK MATCH BEFORE WORK?

02:39.460 --> 02:42.230
SORRY. QUARTERLY REPORT'S
DUE OUT THIS AFTERNOON.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.464
SOMETHING WRONG?

02:43.497 --> 02:45.132
THE COMPANY'S R.O.I.
IS UP 10%.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.900
THAT'S 4% HIGHER
THAN ANY OF OUR COMPETITORS.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.636
ISN'T THAT A GOOD THING?

02:48.669 --> 02:50.137
IT WOULD BE IF THE NUMBERS
ACTUALLY MATCHED

02:50.170 --> 02:51.739
THE ASSETS IN THE BANK.

02:51.772 --> 02:52.740
I'M WORRIED SOMEONE'S BEEN

02:52.773 --> 02:54.908
ARTIFICIALLY INFLATING
THE RETURNS,

02:54.942 --> 02:56.143
NAMELY, MY FATHER.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.645
HE'S SMARTER THAN THAT.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.146
WOULDN'T THE BOARD KNOW

02:59.179 --> 03:01.249
AS SOON AS THEY SAW
THE BALANCE SHEETS TODAY?

03:01.282 --> 03:04.252
WELL, NOT IF HE'S ABLE TO
REFILL THE COFFERS BEFORE THEN.

03:04.285 --> 03:07.154
THE QUESTION IS,
WITH WHAT MONEY?

03:07.187 --> 03:10.858
WELL, MAYBE PLAYING A GAME
WILL HELP YOU FIGURE IT OUT.

03:10.891 --> 03:14.495
HIT A FEW BALLS,
GET YOUR BLOOD GOING.

03:14.528 --> 03:18.899
(cell phone buzzing)

03:18.932 --> 03:20.634
I'VE GOTTA TAKE THIS.

03:20.668 --> 03:23.170
(buzzing continues)

03:23.203 --> 03:24.805
WILL YOU SHUT THE DOORS,
PLEASE?

03:24.838 --> 03:27.708
(buzzing continues)

03:27.741 --> 03:29.743
(HI.p)

03:29.777 --> 03:32.246
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
ME CALLING. IT'S JUST...

03:32.280 --> 03:33.747
something's been
eating away at me

03:33.781 --> 03:35.249
ever since Memorial Day.

03:35.283 --> 03:36.717
WHAT'S THAT?

03:36.750 --> 03:38.218
BEFORE THEY
TOOK CHARLOTTE AWAY,

03:38.252 --> 03:39.920
SHE WHISPERED SOMETHING
IN MY EAR.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.922
SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS SCARED

03:41.955 --> 03:43.257
of her doctor.

03:43.291 --> 03:45.826
I--HE FOUND OUT SHE'S BEEN
USING AGAIN. I MEAN...

03:45.859 --> 03:47.328
she would have said anything
not to go back to that place.

03:47.361 --> 03:48.662
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
I THOUGHT, TOO,

03:48.696 --> 03:50.431
BUT I DID SOME RESEARCH
ON DR. THOMAS LAST NIGHT,

03:50.464 --> 03:52.733
AND IT TURNS OUT,

03:52.766 --> 03:54.735
he has a history of keeping
his patients

03:54.768 --> 03:57.271
longer than necessary
to pad his billing.

03:57.305 --> 03:58.606
YOU DON'T THINK IT'S POSSIBLE

03:58.639 --> 04:01.809
THAT HE FIXED
THE DRUG TEST RESULTS, DO YOU?

04:05.513 --> 04:07.381
DANIEL?

04:07.415 --> 04:09.783
I'M HERE.here?

04:09.817 --> 04:12.286
I hope I did the right thing
in calling you.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.221
OH, YOU DID.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.523
I'd hate to think

04:15.556 --> 04:18.257
that anyone was
taking advantage of Charlotte.

04:18.291 --> 04:20.528
C-CAN YOU E-MAIL ME
WHAT YOU FOUND ON HIM?

04:20.560 --> 04:23.464
YEAH, OF COURSE.

04:23.497 --> 04:25.666
UH, EMILY...

04:27.801 --> 04:30.270
I APPRECIATE THE CALL.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.240
(beep)

04:33.273 --> 04:35.309
(beep)

04:38.512 --> 04:42.282
(clicking)

04:47.455 --> 04:49.823
(seagull calling)

04:51.058 --> 04:53.561
(Thomas) JUST THREE MORE
QUESTIONS, CHARLOTTE.

04:53.594 --> 04:57.865
"DO YOUR THOUGHTS OFTEN FEEL
CLOUDED OR CONFUSED?"

04:57.898 --> 04:59.867
NOT SINCE I STOPPED USING,

04:59.900 --> 05:01.435
AND I HAVE STOPPED USING.

05:01.469 --> 05:03.671
THE BLOOD TEST WAS WRONG.

05:05.439 --> 05:06.707
"DO YOU BELIEVE YOU CAN

05:06.740 --> 05:08.409
SEE OR HEAR THINGS
OTHERS CANNOT?"

05:08.442 --> 05:10.444
NO ONE ELSE SEEMS TO SEE
THAT MY FATHER

05:10.478 --> 05:13.414
IS HOLDING ME HERE
AGAINST MY WILL.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.749
DOES THAT COUNT?

05:15.783 --> 05:17.685
I'M MORE CONCERNED
WITH THE FICTITIOUS PERSON

05:17.718 --> 05:20.287
YOU SAY GAVE YOU
THE DISPOSABLE PHONE

05:20.320 --> 05:21.622
I FOUND
HIDDEN IN YOUR BEDROOM.

05:21.655 --> 05:24.057
JUST READ THE LAST QUESTION.

05:27.428 --> 05:30.464
"DO YOU BELIEVE OTHERS
ARE PLOTTING AGAINST YOU?"

05:35.369 --> 05:36.504
(White-haired Man) SOUNDS LIKE
 I NEED TO INTERVENE.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.005
JUST IN TIME.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.507
(singsongy) HE'S BACK.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.008
(Victoria) YOU DO NOT
 TOUCH MY DAUGHTER.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.310
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

05:43.343 --> 05:44.612
WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME
 TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

05:44.645 --> 05:47.347
WELL, YOU MAY HAVE TIME.
 I DO NOT.

05:47.381 --> 05:49.750
I KEPT THE INITIATIVE
OFF OUR TRAIL FOR NINE WEEKS.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.819
PATIENCE IS NOT
THEIR STRONG SUIT,

05:51.852 --> 05:53.053
NOR MINE.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.557
I KEPT MY END OF THE BARGAIN.

06:01.495 --> 06:04.498
VERONICA AND SAMANTHA CLARKE?

06:04.532 --> 06:07.601
I THOUGHT YOU'D APPRECIATE
THAT TOUCH.

06:07.635 --> 06:10.003
(Nolan)
PASSPORTS, NEW IDENTITIES--

06:10.037 --> 06:11.739
LOOKS LIKE VICKY'S GONNA
FLY THE COOP.

06:11.772 --> 06:14.642
NOT WITH MY SISTER,
SHE ISN'T.

06:14.675 --> 06:17.478
(Victoria)
 WHAT ABOUT EMILY THORNE?

06:17.511 --> 06:19.079
FIRST THINGS FIRST.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.918
I CAN'T PAY YOU UNTIL CHARLOTTE
RECEIVES HER INHERITANCE.

06:28.756 --> 06:30.858
I'LL JUST HANG ON
TO YOURS THEN,

06:30.891 --> 06:33.026
TO MAKE SURE YOU STAY PUT.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.528
THE GOOD NEWS IS,

06:34.562 --> 06:37.765
YOUR DAUGHTER'S A DRUG ADDICT
AND YOU'RE ALREADY DEAD.

06:37.798 --> 06:41.535
THAT MAKES YOU BOTH DAMN EASY
TO DISPOSE OF.

06:41.569 --> 06:45.038
(door opens)

06:45.072 --> 06:47.407
(door closes)

06:47.441 --> 06:51.044
(exhales)
WHAT NOW, REVENGER?

06:51.078 --> 06:54.648
LET THE PUNISHMENT
FIT THE CRIME.

06:54.682 --> 06:58.486
VICTORIA TOOK MY MOTHER
AWAY FROM ME.

07:00.654 --> 07:14.434
IT'S TIME I TOOK HER DAUGHTER
AWAY FROM HER.

07:18.606 --> 07:22.576
***

07:22.610 --> 07:23.777
(yawns)

07:23.811 --> 07:26.046
HEY, PORTER.

07:26.079 --> 07:27.648
IT'S TREY CHANDLER,

07:27.681 --> 07:29.583
YOU KNOW, FROM STUDY HALL?

07:29.617 --> 07:30.718
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

07:30.751 --> 07:32.586
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD
A BOAT IN THIS MARINA?

07:32.620 --> 07:34.788
YEAH, IT'S REALLY EASY
TO MISS BETWEEN THE YACHTS.

07:34.822 --> 07:35.756
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

07:35.789 --> 07:37.491
CHARLOTTE OUT OF REHAB YET?

07:37.525 --> 07:40.460
I DON'T KNOW.
WE DON'T REALLY KEEP IN TOUCH.

07:40.494 --> 07:41.929
AH, ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

07:41.962 --> 07:44.498
YOU'RE SINGLE,
AND IT'S SUMMER, RIGHT?

07:44.532 --> 07:46.433
OH, BY THE WAY,
IF YOU WANT TO JOIN US,

07:46.466 --> 07:48.736
WE'RE, UH, WE'RE SAILING OUT
(thud)SCENT BEACH FOR THE DAY.

07:48.769 --> 07:51.071
CUTE GIRLS, BIKINIS, HMM?

07:51.104 --> 07:53.206
UM... I CAN'T.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.708
WE'RE RENOVATING THE BAR.

07:54.742 --> 07:56.076
WHAT, YOU CAN'T TAKE
A DAY OFF?

07:56.109 --> 07:57.611
NO, I CAN'T.

07:57.645 --> 07:58.812
I TAKE A DAY OFF,
AND THE BAR STAYS SHUT DOWN.

07:58.846 --> 08:01.048
THE BAR STAYS SHUT DOWN,
I DON'T GO TO COLLEGE.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.817
I DON'T GO TO COLLEGE,
THIS IS MY LIFE FOREVER.

08:03.851 --> 08:04.952
***

08:04.985 --> 08:06.820
(scoffs) WOW.

08:06.854 --> 08:07.955
IT SUCKS TO BE YOU.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.657
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.826
***

08:12.860 --> 08:14.695
(horn honks)

08:14.728 --> 08:16.697
(Nolan) Can someone
 please explain to me

08:16.730 --> 08:18.699
how this happened,

08:18.732 --> 08:20.834
why we're being audited?

08:20.868 --> 08:22.836
THE TAX EXAMINER SAID
OUR OFFSHORE HOLDINGS WERE

08:22.870 --> 08:24.137
"QUESTIONABLE."

08:24.171 --> 08:25.873
Well, what years
 are they investigating?

08:25.906 --> 08:27.675
ALL OF THEM.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.142
Who said that?

08:30.878 --> 08:32.613
WHO ARE YOU?

08:32.645 --> 08:34.147
Padma.

08:34.181 --> 08:37.217
LAHARI.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.818
YOUR ACCOUNTING ANALYST.

08:40.721 --> 08:42.722
THE VERY FACT
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT

08:42.756 --> 08:44.725
IS AN INDICATION
OF WHAT'S WRONG HERE...

08:44.758 --> 08:46.727
SIR.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.029
AND I HATE TO BRING THIS UP
AGAIN BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW

08:49.062 --> 08:50.230
YOU DON'T LIKE DELEGATING,

08:50.263 --> 08:51.732
HOWEVER, THIS SEEMS TO BE
AN OPPORTUNE TIME

08:51.765 --> 08:53.100
TO HIRE A C.F.O.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.702
Negative.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.804
I may be a control freak,

08:56.837 --> 09:00.774
but that is why we are
 where we are today.

09:00.808 --> 09:03.110
YOU MEAN BEING AUDITED?
(chuckles)

09:03.143 --> 09:07.748
Let's reconvene tomorrow,
 shall we?

09:09.850 --> 09:10.984
(sighs)

09:12.853 --> 09:15.856
I DON'T THINK MY EMPLOYEES
HAVE ANY RESPECT FOR ME.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.024
WHY WOULD THEY?

09:17.057 --> 09:18.558
YOU'RE NOT WEARING PANTS.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.527
WELL, I MEAN,
THEY DON'T KNOW THAT.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.029
YOU KNOW, I ONCE DID
A VIDEO INTERVIEW

09:22.062 --> 09:24.998
WITH KATIE COURIC
BUTT-NAKED IN MY JACUZZI.

09:25.032 --> 09:26.834
SHE HAD NO IDEA.

09:26.867 --> 09:29.102
HOW'S THE HOUSE HUNTING
COMING?

09:29.136 --> 09:33.841
WELL, HAMPTONS INVENTORY IS
STILL VIRTUALLY NONEXISTENT.

09:33.874 --> 09:36.143
THOUGH I HEAR THE GRAYSON MANOR
MIGHT BE AVAILABLE SOON.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.845
OFF TO REHAB?

09:37.878 --> 09:40.848
KEEP AN EYE ON VICTORIA.
LET ME KNOW IF ANYTHING CHANGES.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.783
OOH, MONSTER MOVIE
MARATHON.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.151
CAN'T WAIT.

09:46.086 --> 09:49.690
WHAT DID YOU SAY
TO JACK LAST NIGHT?

09:49.723 --> 09:51.925
HE CAME HOME WANTING TO KNOW
IF THE BABY IS REALLY HIS.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.827
JACK TOLD YOU HE WAS HERE?

09:53.861 --> 09:56.864
HE DOESN'T KEEP SECRETS
FROM ME.

09:56.897 --> 09:59.032
OH, RIGHT. THAT'S YOUR ROLE
IN THE RELATIONSHIP.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.569
I TOLD HIM I'D GET
A PATERNITY TEST.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.838
GOOD. GET ONE.

10:04.872 --> 10:06.974
LOOK... (exhales)

10:07.007 --> 10:08.842
I HAD A ONE-NIGHT STAND

10:08.876 --> 10:10.577
THE FIRST TIME
YOU SENT ME AWAY.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.946
BUT I STILL THINK
THIS BABY IS JACK'S.

10:12.980 --> 10:16.116
AND IF I'M RIGHT,
YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT IT.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.851
I LOVE HIM.

10:17.885 --> 10:20.754
AND IF YOU'D STOP TRYING TO
UNDERMINE EVERYTHING, THEN...

10:20.788 --> 10:23.824
MAYBE HE'D HAVE A CHANCE
TO LOVE ME, TOO.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.830
YOU'RE RIGHT, AMANDA.

10:29.863 --> 10:31.665
I'M SORRY.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.737
LET ME KNOW
WHAT LAB YOU'RE USING.

10:38.205 --> 10:39.973
WELL, THAT'S WHY
YOU CAME HERE, ISN'T IT,

10:40.007 --> 10:42.009
TO HAVE ME
ENSURE THE RESULTS?

10:44.277 --> 10:47.915
BUT I'M GONNA NEED YOUR HELP
WITH SOMETHING, TOO.

10:47.948 --> 10:50.017
(Conrad)
THANK YOU FOR BEING DISCREET.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.885
IT'S UNFORTUNATE
I HAVE TO DO THIS,

10:51.919 --> 10:54.221
BUT MY DAUGHTER'S
SELF-DESTRUCTION

10:54.254 --> 10:55.756
HAS FORCED MY HAND.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.224
JUDGE MORRIS
SAID TO TELL YOU,

10:57.257 --> 10:59.693
HE'S SORRY FOR ALL
YOUR FAMILY'S BEEN THROUGH.

10:59.727 --> 11:02.329
YEAH. IT HAS BEEN PUNISHING.

11:02.362 --> 11:05.733
(sighs) SOMETIMES I FEEL
LIKE JOB, FROM THE BIBLE,

11:05.766 --> 11:09.269
HAVING ESCAPED WITH ONLY
THE SKIN OF MY TEETH.

11:09.302 --> 11:10.637
(papers rustle)

11:10.670 --> 11:11.939
AT LEAST, AMIDST ALL THIS,

11:11.972 --> 11:14.207
YOU'VE MANAGED TO KEEP
YOUR COMPANY AFLOAT.

11:14.241 --> 11:15.909
(door opens,
telephone ringing in distance)

11:15.943 --> 11:17.878
MR. GRAYSON,
MAY I SPEAK WITH YOU?

11:17.911 --> 11:19.212
MS. DAVENPORT,

11:19.246 --> 11:20.981
YEAH, JUST CLOSE THE DOOR.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.150
(indistinct conversations)

11:23.183 --> 11:24.852
SO HOW'S MY BOY?

11:24.885 --> 11:26.153
NOT HIMSELF.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.855
HE WAS UP EARLY THIS MORNING,

11:27.888 --> 11:30.123
PORING OVER YOUR FINANCIALS.

11:30.157 --> 11:31.892
SOMETHING ABOUT THE NUMBERS
NOT ADDING UP.

11:31.925 --> 11:35.929
OH, WAS HE USING A CALCULATOR
OR HIS FINGERS?

11:35.963 --> 11:38.165
I DID EVERYTHING IN MY POWER
TO DISTRACT HIM,

11:38.198 --> 11:40.667
BUT HE WASN'T BITING.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.870
IS THIS SOMETHING THAT
WE SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT?

11:42.903 --> 11:45.105
THE ONLY THING THAT YOU
SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT

11:45.138 --> 11:48.208
IS KEEPING HIM AWAY FROM
THAT INVESTORS MEETING TODAY.

11:48.241 --> 11:49.409
ALL RIGHT?

11:50.944 --> 11:52.946
WHERE IS HE NOW?

11:52.980 --> 11:55.816
(indistinct conversations)

11:55.849 --> 11:57.017
(door slams)

11:57.050 --> 11:59.853
DR. THOMAS, A WORD.

11:59.887 --> 12:02.089
OF COURSE.
LET'S, UH, STEP INTO MY OFFICE.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.423
OH, THIS WON'T TAKE LONG.

12:03.456 --> 12:04.925
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH OUR FAMILY LAWYER.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.960
HE SAID YOU TESTIFIED TO
CHARLOTTE'S MENTAL INCOMPETENCE.

12:06.994 --> 12:10.297
YOUR SISTER
IS A VERY SICK GIRL.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.999
NO, WHAT'S SICKENING IS
HOW FAR YOU AND MY FATHER WENT

12:12.032 --> 12:13.300
TO PULL THIS SCAM.

12:13.333 --> 12:16.003
NOT THAT YOU'RE A STRANGER
TO ABUSE OF POWER.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.337
NOW WHATEVER HE'S PAYING YOU
FOR YOUR LIES,

12:17.370 --> 12:19.940
BELIEVE ME, IT WON'T OFFSET
THE LAWSUIT I'LL SLAP ON YOU

12:19.973 --> 12:21.074
UNLESS YOU GET ON THE PHONE
TO JUDGE MORRIS

12:21.108 --> 12:23.043
AND RECANT
THAT EVALUATION IMMEDIATELY.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.812
I WILL CALL HIM NOW.

12:30.483 --> 12:34.021
GRAB YOUR THINGS. WE'RE LEAVING.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.856
THEY'RE RELEASING ME?

12:35.889 --> 12:36.957
NO, I AM.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.291
IT TURNS OUT,
DAD WAS KEEPING YOU IN HERE

12:38.325 --> 12:39.927
IN ORDER TO GET HIS HANDS
ON YOUR INHERITANCE.

12:39.960 --> 12:43.330
I KNEW IT.
YOU STOPPED HIM?

12:43.363 --> 12:46.133
I FOUND OUT TOO LATE,
BUT I PROMISE,

12:46.166 --> 12:48.168
I'M GONNA GET IT ALL BACK
FOR YOU, EVERY PENNY.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.837
NOW COME ON.
LET'S GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.272
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE
WIWHAT?U.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.374
ISN'T IT CONVENIENT,
YOU COME IN HERE

12:54.407 --> 12:55.775
ACTING LIKE THE HERO,

12:55.809 --> 12:58.345
BUT ONLY AFTER
DAD STOLE EVERYTHING?

12:58.378 --> 13:00.881
I SWORE AT MOM'S MEMORIAL
I WAS CLEAN,

13:00.914 --> 13:02.883
AND YOU DID NOTHING
TO STOP THEM.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.351
(woman) EXCUSE ME, MISS.
ARE YOU FAMILY?

13:04.384 --> 13:06.987
I'M JUST DROPPING THESE OFF.

13:08.221 --> 13:10.390
SORRY. UNLESS THIS IS
A BAD TIME.

13:10.423 --> 13:12.092
NO, ACTUALLY,
IT'S PERFECT TIMING.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.962
YOU CAN GIVE ME
A RIDE HOME.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.796
GET OUT.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.134
(mouths words)

13:25.538 --> 13:28.408
IS EVERYTHING OKAY,
CHARLOTTE?

13:32.145 --> 13:34.247
WILL YOU TAKE ME
TO MY MOTHER?

13:38.151 --> 13:41.989
(man) * YOU TOOK
ALL MY AGGRAVATION *

13:42.022 --> 13:43.991
***

13:44.024 --> 13:45.158
DAMN IT!

13:45.192 --> 13:47.227
WHAT HAPPENED?

13:47.260 --> 13:48.561
(Jack) I TOLD YOU
TO TURN OFF THE WATER

13:48.595 --> 13:50.097
IF YOU'RE GONNA TOUCH
THOSE PIPES.

13:50.130 --> 13:51.831
YEAH, I GUESS I FORGOT,
YOU KNOW?

13:51.865 --> 13:53.934
KIND OF LIKE YOU FORGOT
ABOUT THAT STRICT WORK SCHEDULE

13:53.967 --> 13:55.802
THAT YOU WERE
HARPING ABOUT EARLIER.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.971
WHERE THE HELL
HAVE YOU BEEN, MAN?

13:58.005 --> 13:59.506
***

13:59.539 --> 14:01.508
ANOTHER BABY CHECK-UP.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.010
SORRY.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.344
YEAH.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.914
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE ARE
(cell phone rings)ELY.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.348
(ring)

14:08.381 --> 14:11.084
IT'S EMILY.

14:11.118 --> 14:13.853
I FORGOT SHE WANTED TO TAKE ME
SHOPPING FOR BABY CLOTHES.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.022
MM.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.390
WE REALLY HIT THE GODMOTHER
JACKPOT, DIDN'T WE?

14:17.424 --> 14:18.558
(chuckles)

14:18.591 --> 14:19.927
DO YOU MIND?

14:19.960 --> 14:21.128
NO, GO AHEAD.

14:21.161 --> 14:23.096
(mouths word)

14:23.130 --> 14:24.097
(keys jangle)

14:24.131 --> 14:25.398
(boat horn blows in distance)

14:27.467 --> 14:30.037
(door opens and closes)

14:30.070 --> 14:32.139
WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:34.942 --> 14:37.044
WE JUST HAD A PATERNITY TEST.

14:37.077 --> 14:40.047
SERIOUSLY?

14:40.080 --> 14:41.581
OKAY.

14:41.614 --> 14:44.151
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

14:44.184 --> 14:45.953
I MEAN, IF IT ISN'T YOURS?

14:45.986 --> 14:47.254
I DON'T KNOW YET.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.622
BUT NO MATTER WHAT SHE'S DONE,
SHE'S STILL AMANDA.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.391
NO, NO.
NO MATTER WHO SHE IS,

14:51.424 --> 14:53.961
IF SHE LIED TO YOU, MAN...

14:53.994 --> 14:57.097
WHY WOULD YOU RAISE
SOMEBODY ELSE'S KID?

14:57.130 --> 14:59.199
I MEAN, IF IT'S YOURS, GREAT.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.534
OBVIOUSLY, WE'LL MANAGE.
BUT IF IT'S NOT...

15:01.568 --> 15:04.371
OUR WORLD IS FALLING APART
AROUND US.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.073
WE DON'T NEED
THE EXTRA BURDEN.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.274
I MEAN, YOU TELL ME

15:07.307 --> 15:09.676
THAT YOU WOULDN'T BE
A LITTLE BIT RELIEVED.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.213
IF YOU WANT,
I CAN WAIT FOR YOU

15:13.246 --> 15:14.547
WHILE YOU TALK
TO YOUR MOTHER,

15:14.581 --> 15:18.018
DRIVE YOU HOME AFTER?

15:18.051 --> 15:20.220
ASSUMING YOU'RE
GOING BACK TO THE HAMPTONS.

15:20.253 --> 15:23.256
***

15:26.126 --> 15:28.495
OR YOU'RE WELCOME
TO STAY WITH ME.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.930
THAT'S REALLY NICE, EMILY.

15:30.964 --> 15:33.200
***

15:33.233 --> 15:34.901
BUT THE TRUTH IS,

15:34.934 --> 15:37.137
MY MOTHER AND I ARE SUPPOSED
TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY.

15:37.170 --> 15:40.307
SHE WANTS TO START A NEW LIFE,
CHANGE OUR NAMES,

15:40.340 --> 15:42.509
JUST DISAPPEAR.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.511
ONLY NOW THAT MY FATHER
HAS DRAINED MY BANK ACCOUNTS,

15:44.544 --> 15:46.679
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

15:46.713 --> 15:49.116
I DON'T THINK THAT VICTORIA
WILL CARE ABOUT THE MONEY

15:49.149 --> 15:51.084
AS LONG AS SHE HAS YOU.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.952
(man) * I CAN'T DEFEND IT

15:52.986 --> 15:55.522
AND, CHARLOTTE, THERE'S
SOMETHING THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW.

15:55.555 --> 15:58.325
I DIDN'T WANT
TO OVERWHELM YOU IN REHAB.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.293
WHAT IS IT?

16:00.327 --> 16:02.429
IF YOU HAVE TIME,

16:02.462 --> 16:05.999
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD...
LET YOUR SISTER TELL YOU.

16:07.434 --> 16:09.302
AMANDA'S BACK?

16:12.472 --> 16:14.407
(engine turns off)

16:14.441 --> 16:17.277
SHE'S PREGNANT.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.212
DUE THIS MONTH.

16:19.246 --> 16:21.181
IT'S A BOY.

16:21.214 --> 16:23.416
I'M GOING TO BE AN AUNT?

16:23.450 --> 16:26.019
CONGRATULATIONS.

16:26.053 --> 16:28.321
(seat belt clicks)

16:33.226 --> 16:34.661
AMANDA.

16:39.299 --> 16:43.203
OH, MY GOD. HI.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.188
(knock on door)

17:01.221 --> 17:02.555
(Charlotte) MOM?

17:02.589 --> 17:04.223
CHARLOTTE?

17:07.426 --> 17:08.461
OH.

17:08.494 --> 17:10.997
OH, MY GOD. IT'S YOU.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.300
OH, YOU'RE HERE. OH.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.301
MM. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

17:15.335 --> 17:17.637
I'VE BEEN WORRIED
HALF TO DEATH ABOUT YOU.

17:17.670 --> 17:20.272
DR. THOMAS
CONFISCATED MY PHONE.

17:20.307 --> 17:22.309
HE WAS WORKING FOR DAD.

17:22.342 --> 17:25.044
THEY TOOK EVERYTHING, MOM.

17:25.078 --> 17:26.779
MY INHERITANCE IS GONE.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.381
ALL OF IT?

17:28.415 --> 17:30.350
DAD HAD A JUDGE DECLARE ME
MENTALLY UNFIT.

17:30.383 --> 17:33.786
OH, THAT PIG IS EVEN MORE
DESPICABLE THAN I EVER IMAGINED.

17:33.820 --> 17:36.523
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY, THOUGH.
IT'S ONLY MONEY--

17:36.556 --> 17:38.024
SUNSHINE AND HAPPY THOUGHTS

17:38.057 --> 17:39.526
AREN'T GOING TO GET US
THROUGH THIS, CHARLOTTE.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.461
WE NEED THAT MONEY
TO SURVIVE.

17:41.494 --> 17:44.231
I CAN GET YOU MONEY, MOM.

17:45.532 --> 17:48.034
BUT I CAN'T GO WITH YOU.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.736
AT LEAST, NOT YET.

17:49.769 --> 17:52.339
I'M GOING TO BE AN AUNT.

17:52.372 --> 17:53.806
OH, GOD.

17:53.840 --> 17:56.776
DON'T TELL ME THAT YOUR BROTHER
IMPREGNATED EMILY THORNE.

17:56.809 --> 17:59.346
IT'S NOT DANIEL.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.448
IT'S MY SISTER...

18:01.481 --> 18:03.250
AMANDA.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.588
LOOK.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.490
YO THIS SHOULD HELP. MS?

18:10.523 --> 18:12.659
IS VICTORIA'S HEART
STILL BEATING?

18:12.692 --> 18:14.294
Was it ever?

18:14.327 --> 18:16.396
WHAT'S THE UPDATE
ON AMANDA ANYWAY?

18:16.429 --> 18:19.666
I hacked into the lab,
but the results aren't in yet.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.668
YOU'LL KNOW
AS SOON AS THEY ARE, THOUGH.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.670
AND SHE JUST OPENED
THE BAG.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.538
(clatters)

18:25.572 --> 18:27.207
WHAT IS THIS SUPPOSED
TO BE?

18:27.240 --> 18:28.541
I WENT HOME AND PACKED

18:28.575 --> 18:30.076
WHATEVER I THOUGHT
YOU COULD SELL FOR CASH.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.512
THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH
TO GET YOU BY FOR NOW,

18:32.545 --> 18:34.347
AND AFTER THE BABY IS BORN,
I CAN BRING MORE.

18:34.381 --> 18:37.617
WHAT, MORE SPOONS AND TIARAS?
THIS IS WORTHLESS TO ME.

18:37.650 --> 18:40.187
WHY IS IT YOU SEEM MORE UPSET
ABOUT THE MONEY

18:40.220 --> 18:41.688
THAN ME STAYING?

18:41.721 --> 18:44.791
I THOUGHT THIS WAS ABOUT US.

18:48.795 --> 18:52.131
YOU'RE RIGHT, CHARLOTTE.

18:52.165 --> 18:53.800
IT WAS NEVER ABOUT US.

18:53.833 --> 18:57.204
MY PLAN WAS ALWAYS TO LEAVE
EVERYTHING BEHIND, YOU INCLUDED.

18:57.237 --> 19:01.107
I ONLY NEEDED YOU
TO ACCESS THE ACCOUNT.

19:01.140 --> 19:05.612
IF YOU WANT TO SPEND THE SUMMER
WITH AMANDA CLARKE, GO AHEAD.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.448
LET HER BE YOUR FAMILY NOW.

19:08.481 --> 19:11.718
YOU REALLY ARE A MONSTER,
AREN'T YOU?

19:11.751 --> 19:14.153
GO ON.

19:14.187 --> 19:16.256
And whatever happens,
 don't come back here!

19:16.289 --> 19:17.724
(door slams)

19:17.757 --> 19:18.891
(Nolan) Tragic.

19:18.925 --> 19:21.628
Victoria pushing Charlie away
to save her?

19:21.661 --> 19:23.330
Bittersweet victory, Ems.

19:23.363 --> 19:24.864
DON'T TAKE
YOUR EYES OFF OF HER.

19:24.897 --> 19:27.334
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

19:27.367 --> 19:29.869
A MOTHER DOESN'T LEAVE
HER DAUGHTER SO EASILY.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.271
(cell phone beeps, door opens)

19:35.575 --> 19:36.676
WHAT HAPPENED?

19:36.709 --> 19:38.645
MY MOTHER.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.648
CAN WE JUST GO, PLEASE?

19:41.681 --> 19:43.616
(British accent)
OH, AND THE POOR LONELY PANTHER

19:43.650 --> 19:45.318
CAME TO REALIZE

19:45.352 --> 19:47.454
SHE WOULD NEVER RETURN
TO THE JUNGLE

19:47.487 --> 19:49.589
FROM WHENCE SHE CAME.

19:49.622 --> 19:52.158
(Padma) SO THIS IS
WHAT YOU DO ALL DAY,

19:52.191 --> 19:54.461
WATCH NATURE CHANNEL VIDEOS?
(chuckles)

19:54.494 --> 19:56.763
(normal voice)
OH. YOU CAUGHT ME. HUH.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.265
AND YOU ARE?

19:58.298 --> 19:59.832
PADMA.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.702
OH. RIGHT. (sighs)

20:02.735 --> 20:04.271
ONE OF MY LAWYERS?

20:04.304 --> 20:06.606
ACCOUNTING ANALYST.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.174
OH.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.611
HUH. WELL, YOU LOOK
DIFFERENT IN 3-D.

20:11.644 --> 20:13.313
WE ALL DO.

20:13.346 --> 20:15.915
SOMETHING YOU'D KNOW IF YOU
CAME TO THE OFFICE OCCASIONALLY.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.284
(clears throat)

20:17.317 --> 20:18.618
(chuckles)

20:18.651 --> 20:20.753
I KNOW YOU SAID NO
TO HIRING A C.F.O.,

20:20.787 --> 20:22.789
BUT THAT IS
A COLOSSAL MISTAKE.

20:22.822 --> 20:23.856
I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND
INSUBORDINATE--

20:23.890 --> 20:24.991
YOU DO.

20:26.659 --> 20:29.195
WHY ARE YOU REALLY HERE,
HMM?

20:29.228 --> 20:31.531
I E-MAILED YOU LINKS

20:31.564 --> 20:34.767
TO SOME POACHABLE C.F.O.s
IF YOU WANT TO LOG ON.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.372
OR I COULD SHOW YOU
ON MY TABLET.

20:39.406 --> 20:42.409
MM. YOU WIN.

20:42.442 --> 20:45.745
BUT, UH...
COULD YOU TURN AROUND?

20:45.778 --> 20:48.648
NEED TO PUT
SOME PANTS ON.

20:48.681 --> 20:51.418
(Conrad)
WELL, I WAS HOPING THAT MY SON

20:51.451 --> 20:53.820
WOULD BE HERE FOR THIS,

20:53.853 --> 20:55.922
BUT I AM THRILLED TO TELL YOU
THAT GRAYSON GLOBAL

20:55.955 --> 20:57.457
HAS FINALLY SHAKEN OFF

20:57.490 --> 20:59.459
THE VESTIGES
OF OUR FINANCIAL CRISIS

20:59.492 --> 21:02.295
AND RISEN FROM THE ASHES.

21:02.329 --> 21:03.796
AS YOU'LL SEE
IN THE PROSPECTUS,

21:03.830 --> 21:05.765
WE TOOK SOME HARROWING RISKS.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.767
BASICALLY, WE JUMPED--

21:07.800 --> 21:10.470
AND YOU BUILT YOUR WINGS
ON THE WAY DOWN,

21:10.503 --> 21:11.771
AS THEY SAY.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.473
PRECISELY.

21:13.506 --> 21:15.742
I TAKE IT THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL
REPORT BACK TO MR. TAKEDA.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.778
I NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU. NOW.

21:18.811 --> 21:19.846
(lowered voice) UNLESS
YOU WANT TO DISCUSS THIS

21:19.879 --> 21:21.314
IN FRONT OF OUR KEY INVESTORS.

21:21.348 --> 21:23.483
UH, EXCUSE ME, GENTLEMEN.

21:23.516 --> 21:26.353
FAMILY MATTERS.

21:26.386 --> 21:27.787
ASHLEY, WOULD YOU?

21:28.988 --> 21:30.289
OH. (exhales)

21:30.323 --> 21:31.724
(door closes)

21:31.758 --> 21:34.694
(Ashley)
UH, AS YOU ALL KNOW...

21:34.727 --> 21:35.862
OF EVERYTHING
YOU'VE EVER DONE,

21:35.895 --> 21:37.330
THIS MIGHT BE
THE MOST REPULSIVE.

21:37.364 --> 21:38.598
(lowered voice) DANIEL,
THIS IS NOT THE PLACE--

21:38.631 --> 21:40.299
NO, YOU CLEANED OUT
CHARLOTTE'S BANK ACCOUNTS.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.301
YOU MANIPULATED
A TEENAGE GIRL

21:42.335 --> 21:43.770
WHO'S STILL MOURNING
HER MOTHER'S DEATH.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.304
I MEAN, MY GOD!
WHAT ARE YOU?

21:45.338 --> 21:46.806
I AM YOUR FATHER.

21:46.839 --> 21:48.908
AND I'M HER FATHER, WHETHER
SHE WANTS ME TO BE OR NOT.

21:48.941 --> 21:50.977
AND EVERY CHOICE I MAKE
IS IN HER BEST INTERESTS.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.812
OH, LIKE HELL IT IS.
THIS IS THE SAME CRAP

21:52.845 --> 21:54.547
WHAT I DID IS DONE!

21:54.581 --> 21:56.849
IT IS OVER.

21:56.883 --> 21:58.851
SO DON'T YOU COME TO ME NOW,
ESPECIALLY NOW,

21:58.885 --> 22:00.720
COMPLAINING THAT I SHOULD'VE
DONE THINGS DIFFERENTLY.

22:00.753 --> 22:02.355
YOU KNOW, IF YOU REALLY WANTED
TO HELP,

22:02.389 --> 22:03.823
YOU'D HAVE GIVEN ME YOUR TRUST
WHEN I ASKED FOR IT,

22:03.856 --> 22:05.525
THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE
HAD TO TOUCH CHARLOTTE'S--

22:05.558 --> 22:06.759
YOU'RE RIGHT, DAD.
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

22:06.793 --> 22:08.828
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.
BUT THIS?

22:08.861 --> 22:10.563
THIS IS FAR FROM OVER.

22:14.767 --> 22:17.570
(cell phone rings)

22:17.604 --> 22:19.672
(rings and beeps)

22:19.706 --> 22:21.073
WHO THE HELL IS THIS?

22:21.107 --> 22:24.677
Conrad, it's Victoria.

22:25.912 --> 22:27.914
IS THIS SOME KIND
OF A JOKE?

22:27.947 --> 22:29.882
OH, YOU WISH.

22:29.916 --> 22:32.051
The next few moments
are going to be

22:32.084 --> 22:34.787
THE MOST IMPORTANT SECONDS
OF YOUR MISERABLE LIFE.

22:34.821 --> 22:37.490
You are going to do
exactly as I say,

22:37.524 --> 22:39.592
OR I WILL HAUNT YOU
ALL THE WAY

22:39.626 --> 22:43.763
TO YOUR LAST PATHETIC DAY
ON EARTH.

22:53.606 --> 22:56.042
SO IT'S TRUE.

22:56.075 --> 22:58.545
EVEN THE DEVIL HIMSELF
DIDN'T WANT YOU.

22:58.578 --> 23:00.847
THE ONLY DEVIL HERE IS YOU.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.616
AND DON'T PRETEND
FOR ONE MOMENT

23:03.650 --> 23:05.652
THAT YOU DIDN'T TRY
TO MURDER ME.

23:05.685 --> 23:08.555
OH, IS THAT THE STORY
YOU'RE TELLING YOURSELF?

23:08.588 --> 23:09.822
I TRIED TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.

23:09.856 --> 23:11.591
I WARNED YOU NOT TO GET
ONTO T(clatters)

23:11.624 --> 23:13.526
YOU SIMPLY FAILED
TO TELL ME WHY.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.061
ARE YOU TELLING ME
YOU WOULD'VE LISTENED?

23:15.094 --> 23:17.630
AGREE TO DISAGREE.

23:17.664 --> 23:18.765
JUST KNOW, IF THERE'D BEEN
ANY OTHER AVENUE,

23:18.798 --> 23:19.932
I WOULD'VE TAKEN IT.

23:19.966 --> 23:21.634
(unzips bag)

23:21.668 --> 23:23.670
WHATEVER HAPPENS
FROM THIS POINT FORWARD

23:23.703 --> 23:25.572
STAYS BETWEEN US.

23:25.605 --> 23:28.675
(clatters)

23:30.477 --> 23:31.611
SO WHAT'S NEXT?

23:31.644 --> 23:33.412
HIT ME.

23:34.647 --> 23:37.049
THIS IS YOUR ONE AND ONLY SHOT,
SO DO IT LIKE A MAN,

23:37.083 --> 23:39.619
IF IT'S EVEN POSSIBLE.

23:39.652 --> 23:41.788
OH, DEAR.

23:41.821 --> 23:45.925
NOTHING WOULD GIVE ME
GREATER PLEASURE.

23:47.527 --> 23:48.895
ALAN ALLERTON,
FORMER C.F.O.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.697
OF A $6-BILLION
TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMP--

23:50.730 --> 23:53.866
OH, $6 BIL
IS A LEMONADE STAND.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.502
PASS.

23:55.535 --> 23:57.003
LOOK,

23:57.036 --> 23:59.606
NO MATTER HOW IMPRESSIVE
THE RESUME,

23:59.639 --> 24:02.775
NONE OF THEM GET THE JOB
BECAUSE NONE OF THEM ARE ME.

24:02.809 --> 24:06.178
STOP THINKING OF IT
AS GIVING UP CONTROL.

24:06.212 --> 24:09.549
THINK OF IT AS GAINING SOMEONE
TO CONTROL COMPLETELY

24:09.582 --> 24:10.850
TO DO THE THINGS
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO.

24:10.883 --> 24:13.920
NOW TH I LIKE
THE SOUND OF.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.655
WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

24:15.688 --> 24:17.824
I AM NOT A CANDIDATE.

24:17.857 --> 24:19.526
I HAVEN'T EVEN FINISHED
GRAD SCHOOL.

24:19.559 --> 24:20.693

I MEAN, YOU DROVE ALL THE WAY

24:24.063 --> 24:25.732
OUT HERE TO LONG ISLAND,
DIDN'T YOU?

24:25.765 --> 24:27.767
THESE PEOPLE I'M PITCHING

24:27.800 --> 24:31.437
HAVE AT LEAST 15 YEARS
OF LEADERSHIP EXPERIENCE.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.606
YES, BUT I DON'T WANT
A LEADER.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.542
I WANT A PARTNER...

24:35.575 --> 24:37.544
THAT I CAN CONTROL.

24:37.577 --> 24:39.746
LOOK, YOU SAID
YOU'RE NOT LEAVING HERE

24:39.779 --> 24:41.748
UNTIL I CHOOSE A C.F.O.?

24:41.781 --> 24:44.584
WELL, HOW ABOUT,
I'M NOT LEAVING HERE

24:44.617 --> 24:47.587
UNTIL YOU SAY YES?

24:47.620 --> 24:49.989
***

24:52.124 --> 24:54.527
(Amanda) HEY.

24:54.561 --> 24:56.028
WHERE'D YOU DISAPPEAR TO?

24:58.497 --> 25:00.667
I PICKED UP THE TEST RESULTS.

25:00.700 --> 25:03.469
DID YOU OPEN THEM?

25:03.502 --> 25:04.771
NO.

25:04.804 --> 25:06.673
I WAS WAITING FOR YOU.

25:06.706 --> 25:08.641
OH. OKAY.

25:11.944 --> 25:13.245
(sniffs)

25:13.279 --> 25:14.814
MM.

25:16.015 --> 25:19.018
(paper rustling)

25:28.761 --> 25:31.931
(sighs)

25:31.964 --> 25:34.000
I TOLD YOU.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.769
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

25:38.738 --> 25:40.840
(paper rustling)

25:43.676 --> 25:47.279
LIKE I SAID,
YOU'RE GONNA BE A DADDY.

25:47.313 --> 25:49.048
(exhales deeply)

25:49.081 --> 25:50.783
(sets papers down)

25:52.719 --> 25:53.820
(sighs)

25:55.121 --> 25:57.590
THANK YOU.

25:57.624 --> 26:00.059
THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT.

26:03.095 --> 26:05.798
I LOVE YOU, JACK.

26:05.832 --> 26:08.735
I'D DO ANYTHING FOR YOU.

26:08.768 --> 26:11.003
ME, TOO.

26:11.037 --> 26:12.905
GOOD.

26:12.939 --> 26:14.941
CAN YOU GET ME A POPSICLE?

26:14.974 --> 26:16.643
I'M HOT. (chuckles)

26:16.676 --> 26:18.110
(laughs)

26:20.747 --> 26:21.914
MM.

26:31.824 --> 26:33.793
(cell phone beeps
and auto-dials)

26:33.826 --> 26:34.794
(ring)

26:34.827 --> 26:36.562
(Amanda) Hey, it's me.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.731
HAS JACK SEEN THE RESULTS?

26:38.765 --> 26:41.868
JUST NOW.

26:41.901 --> 26:44.270
PLEASE TELL ME
IT'S REALLY HIS.

26:46.739 --> 26:48.775
SORRY.

26:48.808 --> 26:50.209
I wish I could.

26:52.344 --> 26:53.746
(voice breaks) I...

26:53.780 --> 26:56.615
I don't know
how to thank you.

26:58.217 --> 26:59.618
GOTTA GO.

26:59.652 --> 27:00.853
(beep)

27:00.887 --> 27:01.821
(sets cell phone down)

27:01.854 --> 27:03.022
(sighs)

27:07.827 --> 27:10.162
(exhales deeply)

27:23.976 --> 27:25.912
(knock on door)

27:25.945 --> 27:27.313
(Daniel) CHAR?

27:30.683 --> 27:32.651
MUST FEEL NICE TO UNPACK.

27:32.685 --> 27:34.887
REPACKING, ACTUALLY.

27:34.921 --> 27:37.289
EMILY OFFERED ME
A ROOM AT HER PLACE.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.125
MM-HMM.

27:39.158 --> 27:41.093
WHAT'S THAT?

27:42.929 --> 27:44.396
I WENT TO THE BANK
AND OPENED UP

27:44.430 --> 27:46.032
A NEW TRUST ACCOUNT FOR YOU--

27:46.065 --> 27:48.100
ONE THAT DAD CAN'T TOUCH.

27:48.134 --> 27:49.802
I TRANSFERRED EVERYTHING
I OWN INTO IT,

27:49.836 --> 27:51.804
INCLUDING MY HALF
OF THE INHERITANCE.

27:51.838 --> 27:54.741
YOU CAN EVEN HAVE MY CAR
IF YOU WANT IT.

27:55.842 --> 27:57.643
WHAT?

27:57.676 --> 27:59.178
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

27:59.211 --> 28:01.180
'CAUSE WHEN YOU WERE BORN,

28:01.213 --> 28:05.117
MOM MADE ME PROMISE
TO BE NICE TO YOU,

28:05.151 --> 28:07.386
AND I DON'T WANT
TO LET HER DOWN.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.356
I'M GONNA MOVE OUT
TO THE POOL HOUSE.

28:10.389 --> 28:12.792
THIS, UH, YOU CAN HAVE
THIS PLACE TO YOURSELF.

28:12.825 --> 28:14.060
DANIEL, I HAVE--

28:14.093 --> 28:15.294
(Ashley) WHAT'S THIS
ABOUT THE POOL HOUSE?

28:17.864 --> 28:20.299
(clears throat) YEAH, I...

28:20.332 --> 28:22.835
I HAVE SOME NEWS. WE'LL TALK
ABOUT IT OVER A DRINK...

28:22.869 --> 28:23.870
OR TWO.

28:26.072 --> 28:27.373
SORRY.
WHAT WERE YOU GONNA SAY?

28:27.406 --> 28:29.341
I'LL FIND YOU
AFTER I UNPACK.

28:46.458 --> 28:49.461
(crickets chirping)

29:10.883 --> 29:13.719
WHAT THE HELL?
WHO DID THIS?

29:13.752 --> 29:15.387
YOU DID.

29:16.989 --> 29:19.859
AND IF I WERE YOU,
I WOULD START RUNNING...

29:19.892 --> 29:23.129
RIGHT NOW.

29:25.031 --> 29:28.467
(sirens wailing in distance)

29:33.005 --> 29:35.341
(sirens continue wailing)

29:38.310 --> 29:39.345
(gravel crunches)

29:39.378 --> 29:40.880
(man) OKAY!

29:40.913 --> 29:42.348
WE'LL GO AROUND BACK.

29:42.381 --> 29:44.183
VICTORIA?!

29:44.216 --> 29:47.019
(man) SEARCH THE PREMISES.

29:47.053 --> 29:49.055
(man)
I SEE IT. SHE'S IN HERE.

29:49.088 --> 29:51.390
(man) FOUND HER. CALL A MEDIC.

29:51.423 --> 29:54.160
OH, MY GOD, VICTORIA.

29:54.193 --> 29:56.528
WHAT DID THAT PIG
DO TO YOU?

29:59.231 --> 30:00.967
(man)
SOMEBODY GET AN AMBULANCE.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.802
(sighs) NOLAN?

30:14.113 --> 30:16.548
(keys jangle)

30:16.582 --> 30:19.018
(click, computer whooshes)

30:19.051 --> 30:20.953
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
 HOW YOU LET HIM GET AWAY.

30:20.987 --> 30:22.388
YOUR MEN WERE ON HIM.

30:22.421 --> 30:24.156
THEY'RE STILL SEARCHING
 THE AREA.

30:24.190 --> 30:26.092
WE NEED TO GET YOU
 TO THE HOSPITAL.

30:26.125 --> 30:27.526
NO, NO HOSPITAL.

30:27.559 --> 30:29.061
PLEASE CALL
 MY PRIVATE PHYSICIAN

30:29.095 --> 30:30.196
AND HAVE HIM MEET ME
 AT THE HOUSE.

30:30.229 --> 30:31.898
I'D LIKE TO GO HOME.

30:31.931 --> 30:35.834
(Conrad) IT'S A MIRACLE
 WHAT THIS WOMAN CAN ENDURE.

30:35.868 --> 30:37.003
(Victoria sighs)

30:37.036 --> 30:39.471
SON OF A BITCH.

30:45.177 --> 30:47.279
(Ashley)
HALF I COULD UNDERSTAND,

30:47.313 --> 30:49.481
BUT WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU FEEL
THE NEED TO GIVE HER EVERYTHING?

30:49.515 --> 30:52.151
BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING
TO DO. LISTEN--

30:52.184 --> 30:54.453
DANIEL?

30:54.486 --> 30:56.055
YOU'RE NOT WELCOME HERE.
GET OUT.

30:56.088 --> 30:58.891
THE STUDY'S JUST TO YOUR LEFT.

30:58.925 --> 31:00.292
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

31:00.326 --> 31:01.560
DANIEL.

31:01.593 --> 31:03.229
OH, MY GOD.

31:03.262 --> 31:06.332
MY DARLING. OH!

31:06.365 --> 31:07.967
ASHLEY, EXCUSE US.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.868
FAMILY ONLY.

31:09.902 --> 31:11.037
I KNOW THIS MUST COME
AS A SHOCK TO YOU.

31:11.070 --> 31:12.871
(Charlotte) MOTHER?

31:12.905 --> 31:15.241
(gasps) CHARLOTTE?

31:15.274 --> 31:16.976
SWEETHEART.

31:17.009 --> 31:18.544
(whispers)
THIS WAS THE ONLY WAY.

31:18.577 --> 31:20.479
HOW IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE?
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

31:20.512 --> 31:22.881
YOUR MOTHER WAS ABDUCTED
THE NIGHT OF THE PLANE CRASH.

31:22.915 --> 31:24.350
YOU WERE KIDNAPPED?

31:24.383 --> 31:25.851
(Conrad) AND RANSOMED.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.019
MR. GRAYSON.

31:27.053 --> 31:28.420
IF YOU'RE READY,
I'LL TAKE YOUR STATEMENT FIRST.

31:28.454 --> 31:29.888
YES, OF COURSE.

31:29.922 --> 31:31.857
UH, DANIEL...

31:31.890 --> 31:33.159
UH, WHY DON'T YOU
COME WITH ME, SON?

31:33.192 --> 31:36.095
I'M SURE YOU'LL WANT
TO HEAR THIS.

31:36.128 --> 31:39.031
GO AHEAD.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

31:39.065 --> 31:40.899
GO ON.

31:40.933 --> 31:42.901
(chuckles)

31:46.372 --> 31:48.874
(lowered voice)
CHARLOTTE, PLEASE FORGIVE ME

31:48.907 --> 31:50.476
FOR PUSHING YOU AWAY
THIS AFTERNOON,

31:50.509 --> 31:51.978
BUT I HAD NO CHOICE.

31:52.011 --> 31:53.579
WHY DID YOU DO IT?

31:53.612 --> 31:55.347
AND WHAT'S GOING ON?

31:55.381 --> 31:56.949
THE MAN WHO I ARRANGED
TO HAVE US DISAPPEAR--

31:56.983 --> 31:58.284
HE WAS LETHAL.

31:58.317 --> 32:00.619
WHEN THE MONEY FELL THROUGH,
HE TURNED ON ME.

32:00.652 --> 32:03.322
AND AS FAR AS YOUR FATHER KNOWS,
YOU KNOW NOTHING,

32:03.355 --> 32:04.623
AND THAT'S THE WAY
IT HAS TO STAY.

32:04.656 --> 32:06.058
GOT IT.

32:06.092 --> 32:07.893
NOW WHAT ABOUT
EMILY THORNE?

32:07.926 --> 32:10.062
HOW MUCH DID YOU TELL HER?

32:10.096 --> 32:11.897
EVERYTHING I KNEW.

32:11.930 --> 32:15.267
BUT WE CAN TRUST HER, MOM.

32:15.301 --> 32:18.404
BRING HER TO ME
IMMEDIATELY.

32:20.072 --> 32:21.340
I WAS DOING EVERYTHING
IN MY POWER

32:21.373 --> 32:24.977
TO MEET HER ABDUCTOR'S
INCESSANT DEMANDS.

32:25.011 --> 32:27.446
BUT IT, UH, IT BLED ME DRY.

32:27.479 --> 32:31.950
DEPLETED ALMOST
ALL MY ACCOUNTS...

32:31.984 --> 32:34.653
AND MY DAUGHTER'S.

32:34.686 --> 32:36.022
ARE YOU SAYING
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED

32:36.055 --> 32:36.989
TO CHARLOTTE'S INHERITANCE?

32:37.023 --> 32:39.191
TONIGHT WAS TO BE
THE FINAL PAYMENT.

32:42.161 --> 32:44.130
DANIEL?

32:44.163 --> 32:47.066
DETECTIVE, A MOMENT?

32:51.137 --> 32:52.471
WHY? WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

32:52.504 --> 32:53.939
THIS WHOLE TIME,
YOU KNEW THE TRUTH?

32:53.972 --> 32:55.674
YOU COULD HAVE AT LEAST TOLD ME
MY MOTHER WAS ALIVE.

32:55.707 --> 32:58.477
(lowered voice) MY TOP PRIORITY
WAS TO PROTECT HER LIFE.

32:58.510 --> 33:02.114
IF I TOLD YOU OR ANYONE,
DANIEL...

33:02.148 --> 33:05.284
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT THIS MAN IS CAPABLE OF.

33:05.317 --> 33:06.652
HE TOOK DOWN THAT PLANE.

33:06.685 --> 33:09.721
HE KILLED POOR LYDIA.

33:09.755 --> 33:11.457
(Victoria)
HE HAD SHOCK-WHITE HAIR,

33:11.490 --> 33:14.126
THE COLOR OF SNOW.

33:21.233 --> 33:23.502
(boat horn blows in distance)

33:23.535 --> 33:26.038
LATE NIGHT
AT THE OFFICE?

33:26.072 --> 33:27.005
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
BACK HERE?

33:27.039 --> 33:28.574
WE JUST DOCKED.

33:28.607 --> 33:31.343
SO, LISTEN, UM...

33:33.079 --> 33:34.313
I NEED A FAVOR.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.482
WHAT KIND OF FAVOR?

33:36.515 --> 33:38.617
I-I NEED YOU TO HOLD ON
TO SOMETHING.

33:40.386 --> 33:41.520
IT--IT'S MY PARENTS.

33:41.553 --> 33:43.021
YOU KNOW,
THEY BREATHE DOWN MY NECK.

33:43.055 --> 33:44.323
THEY GO THROUGH MY CRAP.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.258
I CAN'T KEEP ANYTHING AT HOME
THAT THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

33:46.292 --> 33:49.661
LISTEN, IF THIS IS ABOUT DRUGS,
NO, IT'S NOT. (chuckles)

33:53.065 --> 33:55.101
WHOA.

33:55.134 --> 33:56.368
DID YOU STEAL THAT?

33:56.402 --> 34:00.106
NO, MY DAD GAVE IT TO
MY STEPMOM FOR VALENTINE'S DAY.

34:00.139 --> 34:02.241
AND SHE'S NOT GONNA NOTICE THAT
THAT'S MISSING?

34:02.274 --> 34:05.244
SHE'LL BLAME THE MAID.
YOU KNOW THE TYPE.

34:05.277 --> 34:07.045
LOOK, ALL YOU NEED
TO DO IS JUST

34:07.079 --> 34:10.581
HANG ON TO IT FOR A COUPLE DAYS,
AND I'LL GIVE YOU 500 BUCKS.

34:10.616 --> 34:12.184
(sighs)

34:12.217 --> 34:13.185
WHY ME?

34:13.219 --> 34:15.786
'CAUSE YOU NEED THE MONEY.

34:15.821 --> 34:20.092
THAT'S A LOT OF CASH
TO DO NOTHING. HMM?

34:20.126 --> 34:21.460
COOL.

34:21.493 --> 34:25.063
AND THERE'S A LOT MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

34:30.335 --> 34:31.637
THANK YOU FOR COMING UP
SO QUICKLY.

34:31.670 --> 34:32.804
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

34:32.838 --> 34:34.373
I'M STILL TRYING
TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

34:34.406 --> 34:37.109
ALL I KNOW IS, SHE DID NOT
WANT TO LEAVE WITHOUT ME.

34:37.143 --> 34:40.112
I THINK THIS WAS HER ONLY WAY
OF GETTING OUT OF HIDING--

34:40.146 --> 34:42.080
SO WE CAN BE TOGETHER.

34:42.114 --> 34:44.081
(Velcro crackles)

34:45.417 --> 34:49.155
EMILY, I TOLD MY MOM
WE CAN TRUST YOU.

34:49.188 --> 34:51.357
WELL, CAN WE?

34:51.389 --> 34:53.324
WILL YOU KEEP OUR SECRET?

34:54.760 --> 34:58.164
I KNOW YOU MUST THINK
MY FAMILY'S CRAZY.

34:58.197 --> 34:59.831
BUT THEY'RE MY FAMILY,

34:59.865 --> 35:02.168
AND I NEED MY MOTHER.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.672
MAY I SPEAK WITH HER?

35:09.208 --> 35:11.177
MOTHER?

35:14.380 --> 35:16.114
(sighs) VICTORIA.

35:19.285 --> 35:21.820
WHAT AN INTERESTING
TURN OF EVENTS.

35:21.853 --> 35:24.190
MM. CHARLOTTE TOLD ME WHAT
A GOOD FRIEND YOU WERE TO HER

35:24.223 --> 35:26.625
AFTER I WAS TAKEN, AND...

35:26.658 --> 35:28.394
I WANTED TO THANK YOU.

35:28.427 --> 35:31.563
WELL, I DID WHAT ANYONE WOULD DO
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

35:33.232 --> 35:35.667
I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW
THAT IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,

35:35.701 --> 35:37.203
ANYTHING AT ALL,

35:37.236 --> 35:39.771
I'LL BE HERE ALL SUMMER.

35:39.805 --> 35:42.107
WELL, IT'S LATE.

35:42.140 --> 35:45.411
AND YOU ALL CLEARLY HAVE
SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT.

35:45.444 --> 35:47.379
I'LL WALK YOU OUT.

35:51.183 --> 35:53.752
THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DID
FOR CHARLOTTE TODAY.

35:53.785 --> 35:55.321
WELL, OBVIOUSLY,
I HAD NO IDEA

35:55.354 --> 35:56.822
THIS IS HOW IT WOULD
ALL TURN OUT.

35:56.855 --> 35:58.324
OBVIOUSLY.

35:58.357 --> 36:00.259
YOU'VE BEEN A GOOD FRIEND...

36:00.292 --> 36:03.395
TO THE FAMILY,
CHARLOTTE ESPECIALLY.

36:03.429 --> 36:05.364
LOOK, I KNOW YOU AND MY MOTHER
HAVE NEVER GOTTEN ALONG,

36:05.397 --> 36:06.765
BUT, UH...

36:06.798 --> 36:10.802
WELL, TRAGEDY HAS A WAY OF
BRINGING PEOPLE BACK TOGETHER.

36:10.836 --> 36:12.438
(Victoria) DANIEL.

36:15.641 --> 36:18.610
YOU SHOULD GO.
BE WITH THEM.

36:28.820 --> 36:31.323
(cell phone rings)

36:31.357 --> 36:32.458
(ring)

36:32.491 --> 36:34.360
(ring)

36:34.393 --> 36:35.627
(beep)

36:35.661 --> 36:37.162
HELLO.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.231
YOU HAVE SOMETHING I NEED.

36:42.434 --> 36:44.370
EVERY FRAME OF IT.

36:45.871 --> 36:48.774
YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME.

36:53.745 --> 36:55.180
(man) WE NEED TO GET YOU
 TO THE HOSPITAL.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.348
(Victori (door opens) SPITAL.

36:56.382 --> 36:57.549
YOU CAN CALL
 MY PRIVATE PHYSICIAN

36:57.583 --> 36:58.717
AND HAVE HIM MEET ME AT THE--

36:58.750 --> 37:00.552
OKAY, IN MY DEFENSE,
THERE IS NO WAY

37:00.586 --> 37:03.322
ANYONE COULD'VE
SEEN THAT COMING.

37:03.355 --> 37:04.823
WELL, RIGHT, HAD I KEPT
AN EYE ON VICTORIA,

37:04.856 --> 37:07.393
I WOULD HAVE,
BUT, SEE, THE PROBLEM IS,

37:07.426 --> 37:09.761
EVER SINCE YOU CAME BACK,
AND EVEN BEFORE THAT,

37:09.795 --> 37:11.663
IT'S LIKE YOU JUST
EXPECT ME TO BE

37:11.697 --> 37:14.900
YOUR FASHIONABLY DRESSED,
TECHNOLOGICALLY SAVVY SIDEKICK.

37:14.933 --> 37:16.835
YOU'RE RIGHT.

37:16.868 --> 37:18.437
(necklace clatters)

37:18.470 --> 37:21.573
YOU SHOULD HAVE YOUR OWN LIFE,
YOUR OWN PLACE.

37:21.607 --> 37:23.842
(sighs)
SO IS CHARLOTTE MOVING IN?

37:23.875 --> 37:26.812
NO.

37:26.845 --> 37:28.347
SHE'S UP AT HER HOUSE,

37:28.380 --> 37:30.416
CELEBRATING
HER MOTHER'S SECOND COMING.

37:30.449 --> 37:34.252
OH, VICTORY, VICTORIA.

37:34.286 --> 37:35.687
AND...

37:35.721 --> 37:38.223
TO ADD TO ALL THAT,

37:38.256 --> 37:40.859
AMANDA CARRYING
JACK'S BABY...

37:40.892 --> 37:43.695
WHEW.

37:43.729 --> 37:47.899
I TOLD AMANDA
THAT I FIXED THE RESULTS...

37:47.933 --> 37:49.668
THAT JACK ISN'T THE FATHER.

37:49.701 --> 37:52.371
YOU LIED TO HER?

37:52.404 --> 37:54.406
(scoffs) EMS...

37:54.440 --> 37:57.309
THAT'S DARK, EVEN FOR YOU.

37:57.343 --> 37:59.345
I DON'T CARE
WHERE YOU GO TONIGHT,

37:59.378 --> 38:02.781
BUT YOU CAN'T STAY HERE.
I NEED THE PLACE TO MYSELF.

38:02.814 --> 38:04.550
I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD BE ALONE.

38:04.583 --> 38:06.318
DON'T WORRY. I WON'T BE.

38:08.420 --> 38:10.456
(sighs)

38:10.489 --> 38:12.391
SO, UM...

38:12.424 --> 38:14.926
I WAS WAITING
TO TELL YOU THE NEWS.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.663
IT'S YOUR KID.

38:17.696 --> 38:19.565
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

38:19.598 --> 38:22.468
YOU LEFT THE RESULTS
LYING AROUND UPSTAIRS.

38:22.501 --> 38:23.669
***

38:23.702 --> 38:24.836
(chuckles)

38:24.870 --> 38:26.538
(chuckles)
CONGRATULATIONS.

38:26.572 --> 38:28.774
MM.

38:28.807 --> 38:30.476
LISTEN, WHAT I SAID EARLIER

38:30.509 --> 38:32.778
ABOUT NOT NEEDING
AN EXTRA BURDEN...

38:32.811 --> 38:34.513
THAT'S ME.
I-I'M THMNH-MNH.BURDEN.

38:34.546 --> 38:36.281
YEAH, I AM. I AM.

38:36.314 --> 38:39.385
YOU'RE STARTING A NEW LIFE,
AND I WANT TO, TOO.

38:39.418 --> 38:40.686
I'M GONNA GET MY OWN PLACE

38:40.719 --> 38:42.554
AS SOON AS I CAN
SAVE UP THE CASH.

38:42.588 --> 38:44.856
OKAY, SO NOT ANYTIME SOON.

38:44.890 --> 38:46.024
***

38:46.057 --> 38:48.660
(Amanda) JACK?

38:48.694 --> 38:51.563
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TURN ON
THE TV.

38:51.597 --> 38:53.732
***

38:53.765 --> 38:54.733
(click)

38:54.766 --> 38:56.835
...ARE CONFIRMING
 VICTORIA GRAYSON,

38:56.868 --> 38:59.505
WHO WAS THOUGHT TO HAVE DIED
 OVER TWO MONTHS AGO

38:59.538 --> 39:00.939
IN A PRIVATE PLANE CRASH,

39:00.972 --> 39:02.474
WAS FOUND EARLIER TODAY.

39:02.508 --> 39:03.742
NO WAY.

39:03.775 --> 39:05.411
SOURCES SAY GRAYSON
 WAS ABDUCTED

39:05.444 --> 39:08.580
AND RESTRAINED HERE
 IN THIS REMOTE CABIN.

39:08.614 --> 39:10.649
HER CAPTOR IS STILL AT LARGE.

39:10.682 --> 39:14.052
LOOKS LIKE
THE BITCH IS BACK.

39:14.085 --> 39:17.856
(Conrad) NOTHING WOULD
 GIVE ME GREATER PLEASURE.

39:17.889 --> 39:19.024
(grunts)

39:19.057 --> 39:20.792
(key clicks)

39:20.826 --> 39:23.028
ALL OF THIS WILL EXONERATE YOU.

39:25.597 --> 39:28.467
AND IT'S YOURS...

39:28.500 --> 39:30.902
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED IN RETURN.

39:32.103 --> 39:33.772
YOU ONCE SAID I WAS
A HELL OF A FIGHTER,

39:33.805 --> 39:35.607
LIKE MY MOTHER.

39:37.943 --> 39:39.478
YOU KNEW HER,
DIDN'T YOU?

39:43.415 --> 39:44.816
DID THE GRAYSONS HIRE YOU
TO KILL HER

39:44.850 --> 39:46.885
LIKE YOU KILLED MY FATHER?

39:46.918 --> 39:49.788
IF ANYONE COULD'VE PROVEN
DAVID CLARKE WAS INNOCENT,

39:49.821 --> 39:51.657
IT WAS YOUR MOTHER.

39:51.690 --> 39:54.392
HOW?

39:54.426 --> 39:55.727
WHEN HE ASKED FOR A DIVORCE,

39:55.761 --> 39:57.128
HE TOLD HER HE PLANNED
TO MARRY VICTORIA.

39:57.162 --> 39:59.831
YOUR MOTHER'S TESTIMONY

39:59.865 --> 40:02.934
WOULD'VE BROUGHT DOWN
THE WHOLE HOUSE OF CARDS.

40:08.073 --> 40:10.976
YOU?

40:11.009 --> 40:12.678
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

40:12.711 --> 40:15.781
I REALIZE I'M THE LAST PERSON
YOU WOULD EVER WISH TO SEE.

40:15.814 --> 40:18.950
BUT I AM SICK WITH GUILT
FOR THE MISTAKES I'VE MADE.

40:18.984 --> 40:20.952
YOU STOLE MY HUSBAND,
YOU WHORE.

40:23.789 --> 40:25.423
I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO BE

40:25.457 --> 40:27.659
VERY HARD
FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND,

40:27.693 --> 40:29.127
BUT DAVID
HAD BOTH OF US FOOLED.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.630
HE'S NOT THE MAN
YOU THOUGHT YOU MARRIED.

40:32.831 --> 40:35.901
HE'S A MURDERER

40:35.934 --> 40:37.736
AND A TERRORIST.

40:37.769 --> 40:39.705
(laughs)

40:39.738 --> 40:42.073
YOU SHOULD SEE IF THEY HAVE
A VACANCY HERE.

40:42.107 --> 40:44.075
THIS IS NO JOKE,
I ASSURE YOU.

40:44.109 --> 40:45.777
HE COULDN'T KILL ANYONE.

40:45.811 --> 40:47.946
DAVID WOULDN'T HURT A FLY.

40:47.979 --> 40:49.948
HE PUT YOU IN HERE,
DIDN'T HE?

40:49.981 --> 40:52.851
AND HE TOOK YOUR DAUGHTER
AWAY FROM YOU.

40:52.884 --> 40:54.886
WHO IS HE?

40:56.722 --> 40:58.990
THIS IS FEDERAL AGENT
GORDON MURPHY.

41:00.726 --> 41:03.094
IN 48 HOURS, HE AND HIS TEAM
ARE GOING TO ARREST DAVID

41:03.128 --> 41:05.831
FOR HIS ROLE IN DESTROYING
A JET LINER.

41:05.864 --> 41:08.834
(buckles clinking)

41:10.836 --> 41:12.904
DON'T WORRY.

41:12.938 --> 41:14.072
I'LL KEEP YOU SAFE.

41:14.105 --> 41:16.508
WHAT ABOUT MY DAUGHTER?
WHERE IS SHE?

41:16.542 --> 41:18.510
SHE'S IN GOOD HANDS.
DON'T WORRY.

41:18.544 --> 41:21.547
IN THE NEXT COUPLE
OF DAYS,

41:21.580 --> 41:23.014
WHEN ALL THIS GOES PUBLIC,

41:23.048 --> 41:25.617
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT
I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.

41:25.651 --> 41:28.954
BUT YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON
WHETHER OR NOT YOU AGREE

41:28.987 --> 41:30.889
TO LET US HELP YOU.

41:33.191 --> 41:36.227
(Emily) FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE
 IN THE RESURRECTION,

41:36.261 --> 41:40.031
DEATH IS INCONSEQUENTIAL.

41:40.065 --> 41:42.233
AND THEN YOU KILLED HER?

41:42.267 --> 41:45.571
THAT WAS THE PLAN,
BUT YOU KNOW, I...

41:45.604 --> 41:47.973
DON'T ALWAYS FOLLOW ORDERS.

41:48.006 --> 41:50.241
THEN WHAT DID YOU DO
TO HER?

41:50.275 --> 41:52.477
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW.

41:52.510 --> 41:53.645
(grunting)

41:53.679 --> 41:54.946
IN THE RESURRECTION,

41:54.980 --> 41:56.915
THOSE THAT WERE DEAD LIVE,

41:56.948 --> 42:00.485
AND THOSE WHO LIVE
 BELIEVE THEY SHALL NEVER DIE.

42:00.518 --> 42:01.920
(whispers) GOOD-BYE, AMANDA.

42:01.953 --> 42:03.755
(normal voice) I'M SORRY
IT HAS TO END THIS WAY.

42:03.789 --> 42:04.923
(muffled gunshot)

42:04.956 --> 42:06.024
(grunts)

42:08.093 --> 42:09.895
((thud)

42:09.928 --> 42:13.131
(panting)
