WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:04.213
<i>While my sister and I
are twins,</i>

00:04.296 --> 00:06.048
<i>we've always been different.</i>

00:06.132 --> 00:08.968
<i>By the age of two,
I was reading books.</i>

00:09.051 --> 00:11.178
<i>Missy was content to eat them.</i>

00:11.262 --> 00:13.764
<i>By five, I had
a healthy appreciation</i>

00:13.848 --> 00:15.683
<i>for a well-organized
work space.</i>

00:16.392 --> 00:19.228
<i>My sister less so.</i>

00:19.311 --> 00:21.230
<i>Which is not to say</i>

00:21.313 --> 00:23.065
<i>she doesn't have qualities I admire.</i>

00:23.149 --> 00:24.442
Get it. Get it.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.610
It's just a spider.
Calm down.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.320
It's got eight
legs and fangs.

00:28.404 --> 00:30.156
I see no reason to be calm.

00:30.239 --> 00:31.407
Did you kill it?

00:31.490 --> 00:33.576
- Yup.
- Are you sure?

00:33.659 --> 00:35.369
You tell me.

00:35.453 --> 00:39.165
<i>The bond between twins
is an incredibly close one,</i>

00:39.248 --> 00:41.917
<i>which is why I moved
1,500 miles to California</i>

00:42.001 --> 00:43.836
<i>the first chance I got.</i>

00:45.713 --> 00:48.549
<i>♪♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪♪</i>

00:48.632 --> 00:51.469
<i>♪♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪♪</i>

00:51.552 --> 00:53.971
<i>♪♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪♪</i>

00:54.055 --> 00:56.348
<i>♪♪ I am a mighty little man ♪♪</i>

00:56.432 --> 01:00.227
<i>♪♪ I am a mighty little man ♪♪</i>

01:03.773 --> 01:05.274
- Hey.
- Hello.

01:05.357 --> 01:06.358
You got a minute?

01:06.442 --> 01:08.362
John has something
he wants to talk to you about.

01:08.444 --> 01:09.987
I brought you kolaches.

01:10.071 --> 01:11.238
Ooh, yummy.

01:11.322 --> 01:12.948
Mmm. Mmm.

01:13.032 --> 01:14.492
So, what's up?

01:14.575 --> 01:16.595
You comin' to me to ask
for Connie's hand in marriage?

01:16.619 --> 01:18.079
No.

01:18.704 --> 01:20.956
But if that were
to come to pass,

01:21.040 --> 01:24.001
are you authorized
to bless the union?

01:26.295 --> 01:27.630
He was joking.

01:27.713 --> 01:29.006
Oh.

01:30.091 --> 01:31.884
- Tell him.
- Okay.

01:31.967 --> 01:33.677
So, some colleagues of mine

01:33.761 --> 01:37.473
at the university are doing
a research study on twins.

01:37.556 --> 01:40.101
I told them about
Sheldon and his sister,

01:40.184 --> 01:42.186
and they were most intrigued.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.105
Uh, what kind of study?

01:44.188 --> 01:45.815
It's a longitudinal
investigation

01:45.898 --> 01:48.067
of environmental
and genetic factors

01:48.150 --> 01:51.153
in the development of cognitive
and other capacities

01:51.237 --> 01:54.406
in pairs of fraternal
and identical twins.

01:55.366 --> 01:56.867
You asked.

01:56.951 --> 02:00.079
Well, geez,
I don't... I don't know

02:00.162 --> 02:02.665
if I want some scientists
pokin' and proddin' the kids.

02:02.748 --> 02:04.226
Oh, but they wouldn't
be poked and prodded.

02:04.250 --> 02:06.919
They just have to, you know,
answer some questions.

02:07.002 --> 02:09.505
And maybe some
puzzles and tests.

02:10.131 --> 02:12.091
That's not too bad.
Where is it?

02:12.174 --> 02:14.301
- Houston.
- And it just got bad.

02:14.385 --> 02:16.345
That's... that's a long drive.

02:16.428 --> 02:20.015
It does pay $50 an hour
plus gas and expenses.

02:20.724 --> 02:21.809
Really?

02:21.892 --> 02:23.769
I told you to start with that.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.938
Oh.

02:28.190 --> 02:29.859
No. See, Mary,
that's the best part...

02:29.942 --> 02:32.278
there's no pokin'
and proddin'. Plus,

02:32.361 --> 02:34.613
you know how much
Sheldon loves puzzles and tests.

02:34.697 --> 02:36.323
I'm not sure.

02:36.407 --> 02:38.284
Think about the money.

02:38.367 --> 02:41.078
50 bucks an hour,
four or five hours a week.

02:41.162 --> 02:42.639
That... that's more
than our mortgage.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.331
I know, I know.

02:44.415 --> 02:45.958
But Sheldon's already
self-conscious

02:46.041 --> 02:47.585
about being different
from other kids.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.461
I worry how this might
affect him.

02:49.545 --> 02:51.630
You're being too protective.
He's a rock.

02:51.714 --> 02:53.257
A rock?

02:53.340 --> 02:54.925
Are we raising
the same child?

02:55.009 --> 02:56.677
And what about Missy?

02:56.760 --> 02:58.429
Aren't these tests gonna
make her feel bad

02:58.512 --> 03:00.014
that she's not
as smart as Sheldon?

03:00.097 --> 03:01.765
I'm not as smart as Sheldon.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.809
Doesn't make me feel bad.

03:03.893 --> 03:06.896
And we could put the money aside
for their college education.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.190
That's a good point.

03:09.273 --> 03:10.357
It's a great point.

03:10.441 --> 03:12.043
I don't have to tell you,
times are changing.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.569
Kids are pitching in.

03:13.652 --> 03:15.571
Like that Webster kid on TV...

03:15.654 --> 03:17.907
he's making buckets
of money for his parents.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.492
Well...

03:20.576 --> 03:22.203
I suppose we could
give it a try.

03:22.286 --> 03:24.121
There you go.
I'll call Sturgis,

03:24.205 --> 03:25.831
tell him we're in.

03:25.915 --> 03:28.125
Baby, I'm getting
a fishing boat.

03:31.462 --> 03:35.090
So, Sheldon, Missy,
we got some exciting news.

03:35.174 --> 03:37.468
- Georgie took a bath?
- No.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.303
And how come I don't get
exciting news?

03:39.386 --> 03:40.888
This isn't about you.

03:40.971 --> 03:43.307
But after dinner,
why don't you go rinse off?

03:43.390 --> 03:45.142
- So, what's up?
- Well,

03:45.226 --> 03:46.852
a couple of scientists
at the college

03:46.936 --> 03:48.312
where Dr. Sturgis teaches
are doing

03:48.395 --> 03:50.439
a research
study on twins.

03:50.522 --> 03:52.608
They want to meet you guys,
ask you some questions.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.652
Oh, boy, a research study.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.015
Will they give us written tests?

03:56.070 --> 03:58.489
- Yeah, I think so.
- Oh, boy.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.659
Now, you don't have to
do this if you don't want to.

04:01.742 --> 04:02.993
It's purely volunteer.

04:03.077 --> 04:04.328
I don't want to do it.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.580
- Why not?
- They probably just want to find out

04:06.664 --> 04:09.333
why you're so smart
and I'm just average.

04:09.416 --> 04:12.378
Average?
That's a little generous.

04:12.461 --> 04:13.879
Why don't they want
to test me?

04:13.963 --> 04:16.214
- Georgie, not now.
- 'Cause I'm available.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.235
Listen, why don't we
just go there this Saturday

04:18.259 --> 04:19.260
and give it a try?

04:19.343 --> 04:21.845
And if you don't like it,
we don't have to do it again.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.889
Or they'll love it,
and they'll do it till

04:23.973 --> 04:25.683
they're 18, 19 years old.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.184
I already love it.

04:27.268 --> 04:29.603
My man. Missy?

04:32.106 --> 04:34.608
I believe there might be
a Dairy Queen on the way there.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.945
Can I get an Oreo Blizzard?

04:38.028 --> 04:39.196
You know what I think?

04:39.280 --> 04:41.740
I think you're smarter than him.

04:44.326 --> 04:46.829
Dr. Thorpe and Dr. Pilson,

04:46.912 --> 04:48.998
here are your
research volunteers,

04:49.081 --> 04:50.165
Sheldon and Missy.

04:50.249 --> 04:51.417
So nice to meet you.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.752
Thank you for participating
in our study.

04:53.836 --> 04:56.588
Always happy to help advance
our understanding of me.

04:56.672 --> 04:58.215
I'm just in it
for the Dairy Queen.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.175
All right.

05:00.259 --> 05:02.052
Um, if you two wouldn't
mind waiting here,

05:02.136 --> 05:04.513
we'd like to start by talking
to your mom, dad, and grandma.

05:05.514 --> 05:06.765
Why?

05:06.849 --> 05:08.285
Just to get some
background information

05:08.309 --> 05:09.518
on the both of you.

05:09.601 --> 05:12.855
Smart. Ask how old I was
when I completed potty training.

05:12.938 --> 05:14.148
You won't believe it.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.525
I'll do that.

05:16.608 --> 05:18.777
Will you keep an eye on 'em?

05:18.861 --> 05:21.363
Well, I'll try, but
if they start running,

05:21.447 --> 05:22.607
you may never see them again.

05:24.366 --> 05:25.659
Shall we?

05:27.953 --> 05:29.288
We are on the clock, right?

05:29.371 --> 05:30.706
- George.
- Hmm?

05:39.340 --> 05:42.217
Boy, this
brings back some memories.

05:42.301 --> 05:45.179
How come?
Well, when I was your age,

05:45.262 --> 05:48.432
I was also taken to a university
to be studied.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.768
Because they thought
you were really smart?

05:50.851 --> 05:54.271
Because they thought
I was clinically insane.

05:54.355 --> 05:56.398
And it wasn't just me.

05:56.482 --> 05:58.192
Did you know that
when Albert Einstein

05:58.275 --> 06:00.277
was a little boy,
his parents worried

06:00.361 --> 06:02.321
there was something
wrong with him?

06:02.404 --> 06:04.156
Because he couldn't
comb his hair?

06:04.239 --> 06:07.242
No, that was a choice
he made later in life.

06:07.326 --> 06:08.952
When he was young,

06:09.036 --> 06:11.914
he wanted nothing to do
with other children,

06:11.997 --> 06:15.501
and would often have
extreme temper tantrums.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.336
He sounds like you.

06:17.419 --> 06:20.172
I know.
Isn't it great?

06:23.008 --> 06:24.635
Well, to be perfectly honest,

06:24.718 --> 06:27.554
Sheldon has always avoided
children his own age.

06:27.638 --> 06:28.972
Tell 'em about
temper tantrums.

06:29.056 --> 06:32.351
They're not temper tantrums,
he just has strong opinions.

06:32.434 --> 06:33.560
Yeah,

06:33.644 --> 06:35.896
like when you yell
and stomp your feet,

06:35.979 --> 06:38.774
and slam the door
off its hinge.

06:39.358 --> 06:41.235
They're scientists.
You can't trick 'em.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.115
And, as for Missy,
she's just the opposite.

06:46.198 --> 06:48.450
Loves to be around people
and other kids.

06:48.534 --> 06:49.701
Makes friends easy.

06:49.785 --> 06:51.912
Does she have temper
tantrums as well?

06:51.995 --> 06:54.206
Nope.
She's very even-keeled.

06:54.289 --> 06:55.457
Except for when she's eating.

06:55.541 --> 06:56.741
You put your hand
near her face

06:56.792 --> 06:58.103
when she's working
on a lamb chop,

06:58.127 --> 06:59.628
she will bite off a finger.

06:59.711 --> 07:01.797
Our daughter doesn't bite.

07:01.880 --> 07:05.342
Right here,
Thanksgiving, 1986.

07:07.803 --> 07:10.764
Was there anything unusual
about your pregnancy?

07:10.848 --> 07:13.267
- No, not that I remember.
- Really?

07:13.350 --> 07:15.477
You cried for, like,
seven months.

07:15.561 --> 07:17.604
Those were tears of joy.

07:17.688 --> 07:19.481
What about all those times
you punched me?

07:19.565 --> 07:20.941
Punches of joy.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.736
You're not gonna get much
out of Fred and Wilma here.

07:24.820 --> 07:27.239
Why don't you just
get crackin' on the kids?

07:29.450 --> 07:32.911
Okay, Sheldon, this first
battery of tests measures

07:32.995 --> 07:35.122
basic problem-solving abilities.

07:35.205 --> 07:38.417
Is the Kaufman test or the
Wechsler Intelligence Scale?

07:39.460 --> 07:41.128
Are you familiar with those?

07:41.211 --> 07:43.291
It's embarrassing,
but I enjoy a little light reading

07:43.338 --> 07:44.339
in the bathroom.

07:45.424 --> 07:48.010
Okay.
Are you ready?

07:48.093 --> 07:50.220
- Will I be timed?
- Yes.

07:50.304 --> 07:53.557
Fantastic.

07:54.391 --> 07:55.392
Okay, Missy,

07:55.476 --> 07:57.102
the first thing
we're gonna do is test

07:57.186 --> 07:58.645
your problem-solving abilities.

07:58.729 --> 08:01.106
- Okay.
- You ready?

08:01.190 --> 08:02.441
I just have one question.

08:02.524 --> 08:03.609
What's that?

08:03.692 --> 08:05.194
Do you always wear
your hair up?

08:05.277 --> 08:08.739
Uh, well, usually at work, yes.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.616
I bet it looks cute down.

08:11.575 --> 08:13.452
Thank you.
Okay,

08:14.369 --> 08:15.370
you're all set.

08:15.454 --> 08:17.247
Is that camera
gonna be on?

08:17.331 --> 08:18.582
Yes.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.125
Can you move it
over to that side?

08:20.209 --> 08:21.251
Why?

08:21.335 --> 08:23.146
If I've learned one thing
from school picture day,

08:23.170 --> 08:24.922
it's that I look better
from that side.

08:25.797 --> 08:28.550
Sure, I'll move it.

08:29.885 --> 08:30.969
Okay...

08:31.053 --> 08:32.346
And bring it a little closer.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.392
- How's that?
- Great.

08:37.476 --> 08:38.684
Okay.

08:38.769 --> 08:41.563
- Whenever you're ready.
- Wait.

08:41.647 --> 08:43.815
Do I have any Oreos
in my teeth?

08:44.691 --> 08:45.776
No.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.361
- Ready to start?
- One last thing.

08:47.444 --> 08:50.280
Did you ever think of wearing
that white coat with a belt?

08:51.031 --> 08:52.533
No.
You should.

08:52.616 --> 08:54.243
'Cause you have
a very nice figure,

08:54.326 --> 08:56.828
and it's lost in there.

08:59.122 --> 09:01.291
Hey, check this out.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.127
<i>Did you see</i>
Honey, I Shrunk the Kids?

09:04.211 --> 09:05.837
- No.
- You should.

09:05.921 --> 09:07.965
'Cause there's a lot
of good science stuff in it.

09:10.259 --> 09:11.260
<i>Kudos on the question</i>

09:11.343 --> 09:13.679
"Which train gets
to St. Louis first?"

09:14.596 --> 09:15.806
Hmm.

09:17.558 --> 09:19.476
<i>I have to tell you something.</i>

09:19.560 --> 09:21.478
Why don't you
finish the test first?

09:21.562 --> 09:22.854
This can't wait.

09:22.938 --> 09:25.065
The other doctor's
got a crush on you.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.775
Oh, dear Lord.

09:26.858 --> 09:28.235
Oh, um...

09:28.318 --> 09:31.071
I don't...
I don't think so.

09:31.154 --> 09:32.447
Let's get back to the test.

09:33.198 --> 09:34.408
Okay.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.287
Why? What did you see?

09:38.370 --> 09:40.998
When you're not looking,
he stares at your tushy.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.207
Really?

09:42.291 --> 09:44.001
Imagine if you
wore the belt.

09:45.335 --> 09:46.628
Clever girl.

09:46.712 --> 09:49.506
That would accentuate
her buttocks.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.011
I can't watch.
Switch it back to Sheldon.

09:56.138 --> 09:58.390
Hot dog, syllogisms.

09:58.473 --> 10:00.017
If all squares
are parallelograms,

10:00.100 --> 10:02.185
and all squares
are rectangles,

10:02.269 --> 10:04.563
then some parallelograms
are rectangles.

10:04.646 --> 10:07.107
Who was this test
made for, children?

10:07.190 --> 10:09.109
I'm bored.
Turn it back to Missy.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.195
Go ahead.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.656
<i>This question about a train
going to "S-T" Louis</i>

10:14.740 --> 10:16.825
<i>makes no sense.</i>

10:16.908 --> 10:18.994
<i>It's okay to guess.</i>

10:20.621 --> 10:23.040
Take your time, baby.
The meter's running.

10:25.626 --> 10:28.420
Well, thank you all very much.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.130
This was a great start.

10:30.213 --> 10:32.174
Thank you.
Did you have fun?

10:32.257 --> 10:35.302
I got to take a test
on a Saturday. Heck yeah.

10:35.385 --> 10:39.348
He's like a young version of me,
but without corrective shoes.

10:40.515 --> 10:41.642
Missy, what'd you think?

10:41.725 --> 10:42.893
The tests were
just okay,

10:42.976 --> 10:44.269
but I like Sandra.

10:45.062 --> 10:48.023
Well, thank you, Missy.
I like you, too.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.526
All right,
we'll see y'all next Saturday.

10:51.610 --> 10:53.236
You bet we will.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.824
Good God, George,
have a little dignity.

11:02.579 --> 11:05.332
Are you doing something
different with your hair?

11:06.750 --> 11:09.252
No, uh, why?

11:09.878 --> 11:12.506
No reason, just looks nice.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.258
Oh!
Thank you.

11:15.342 --> 11:18.095
Um, uh, what do you think
about maybe stopping

11:18.178 --> 11:21.723
for a drink after,
to discuss the test results?

11:21.807 --> 11:24.184
I would like that.

11:36.905 --> 11:37.948
Oh, yeah.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.783
Get down.

11:41.076 --> 11:43.745
- We're home.
- Hey.

11:44.621 --> 11:47.207
- What you watching?
<i>- Soul Train.</i>

11:47.290 --> 11:48.917
I like trains.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.002
It's not that kind
of train, dummy.

11:51.545 --> 11:54.131
Well, that seems
like false advertising.

11:58.802 --> 12:01.138
Ooh, you sexy little thing.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.931
<i>George!</i>

12:07.602 --> 12:10.689
I do not like what this study
is doing to Sheldon.

12:10.772 --> 12:12.816
What're you talking about?
He had a great time.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.651
All the way home
all he could talk about

12:14.735 --> 12:17.571
is how that doctor thought he
was so smart. It's not healthy.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.298
Would it make you
feel any better

12:19.322 --> 12:20.925
if I told you how much money
we made today?

12:20.949 --> 12:22.117
No, it would not.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.535
$300.

12:23.618 --> 12:25.203
- Really?
- Cash.

12:27.330 --> 12:29.791
Okay, well, still, I...

12:29.875 --> 12:32.586
I'm not interested
in profiting off my children.

12:32.669 --> 12:35.672
You see, honey, that's where
you and I are very different.

12:45.932 --> 12:46.975
Boats.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.519
Sheldon, what do you think

12:49.603 --> 12:51.271
is happening in this picture?

12:51.354 --> 12:54.274
Easy. There are four chimpanzees
in a living room.

12:54.357 --> 12:56.526
<i>Okay, but what can you
tell me about them?</i>

12:57.611 --> 12:59.905
<i>They're not behaving
like chimpanzees.</i>

12:59.988 --> 13:00.989
Anything else?

13:01.823 --> 13:03.742
Chimpanzees don't drink tea.

13:04.493 --> 13:06.369
Is that it?

13:06.912 --> 13:08.139
Well, I suppose
it might be coffee,

13:08.163 --> 13:09.748
but they don't
drink that either.

13:10.332 --> 13:12.876
Anything interesting
about their body language?

13:14.878 --> 13:15.962
No.

13:16.046 --> 13:18.131
I think they found
his kryptonite.

13:22.135 --> 13:25.597
Missy, what do you think
is happening in this picture?

13:25.680 --> 13:26.848
The girl monkey on the couch

13:26.932 --> 13:28.433
is telling the
guy monkey a secret.

13:28.517 --> 13:31.186
Must be something juicy,
'cause he's smiling.

13:31.269 --> 13:32.521
Anything else?

13:32.604 --> 13:33.939
It might be dirty,

13:34.022 --> 13:35.166
'cause this girl monkey
is sending

13:35.190 --> 13:36.817
the kid monkey out of the room.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.319
He doesn't want to go.
He looks sad.

13:39.402 --> 13:40.487
Is that all?

13:40.570 --> 13:42.405
The monkeys on the couch
are drinking tea,

13:42.489 --> 13:43.949
so it's a tea party.

13:44.032 --> 13:47.202
Okay, very good.
Let's look at another picture.

13:47.285 --> 13:50.622
I'm not done.
The monkey in the painting

13:50.705 --> 13:51.915
is wearing an old lady hat,

13:51.998 --> 13:53.917
so she's probably
a meemaw monkey.

13:54.751 --> 13:56.002
She's not
at the party,

13:56.086 --> 13:58.922
so she must be bowling or dead.

14:00.048 --> 14:02.884
Well, Missy
won that round.

14:02.968 --> 14:05.512
It's actually
not a contest, George.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.347
This is Texas.
Everything's a contest.

14:08.390 --> 14:09.933
<i>A woman in a doorway.</i>

14:10.016 --> 14:11.434
Anything else?

14:11.518 --> 14:13.603
She's holding her head
with her hand.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.522
And what do you think
that means?

14:15.605 --> 14:17.148
Um...

14:17.232 --> 14:20.026
Wouldn't you rather ask me
about trains going to St. Louis?

14:20.110 --> 14:23.238
Good gravy, she's sad,
Sheldon, come on.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.574
Oh, she's very upset.

14:25.657 --> 14:27.617
I don't know why.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.536
Oh! Maybe she wasn't invited

14:29.619 --> 14:31.454
to the tea party
at the monkey house.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.375
Also, she's wearing a belt,
like you are.

14:35.458 --> 14:37.294
Nice going.
Very cute.

14:40.338 --> 14:41.756
And I'm loving the hair.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.592
Yeah.

14:43.675 --> 14:46.261
A lion sitting in a chair,
holding a pipe.

14:46.344 --> 14:47.345
Good.

14:47.429 --> 14:49.556
But what do you think
is on his mind?

14:49.639 --> 14:51.474
How should I know?
Maybe he's wondering

14:51.558 --> 14:53.268
why he's posing
for a silly picture

14:53.351 --> 14:54.644
instead of eating a gazelle.

14:55.604 --> 14:56.646
<i>Anything else?</i>

14:57.522 --> 14:59.691
What exactly are we doing here?

14:59.774 --> 15:01.192
I thought the purpose
of this study

15:01.276 --> 15:03.194
was to find out how smart I am.

15:03.278 --> 15:05.071
<i>That's what we're doing,</i>

15:05.155 --> 15:06.955
but there are different kinds
of intelligence.

15:07.657 --> 15:08.783
Poppycock!

15:08.867 --> 15:10.052
<i>There's only one kind
of intelligence...</i>

15:10.076 --> 15:11.745
George, Sheldon's getting upset.

15:11.828 --> 15:13.038
I don't like it.

15:13.121 --> 15:14.881
All right, I'll just
change it back to Missy.

15:16.041 --> 15:18.418
You are an insightful
young lady.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.837
I don't know what that means,
but thank you.

15:20.921 --> 15:22.797
It means perceptive.

15:22.881 --> 15:24.841
You see things most people miss.

15:24.925 --> 15:27.218
My name is Missy... go figure.

15:28.178 --> 15:29.429
Have you always been that way?

15:29.512 --> 15:32.223
I guess so. I think when
you're on your own a lot,

15:32.307 --> 15:34.309
you get good at seeing
that kind of stuff.

15:34.392 --> 15:36.436
<i>Really?</i>

15:36.519 --> 15:38.521
My dad does football
with my older brother,

15:38.605 --> 15:40.440
so they're like a team.

15:41.441 --> 15:44.694
And my mom and meemaw spend all
their time fussing over Sheldon,

15:44.778 --> 15:46.571
so they're like a team, too.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.865
So no one's on your team?

15:49.407 --> 15:51.785
Nope.
It's just me.

15:51.868 --> 15:53.411
Oh, Lord.

15:54.704 --> 15:57.290
<i>Hey, what's up with you
and Dr. Pillsbury?</i>

15:58.375 --> 15:59.793
Dr. Pilson?

16:00.335 --> 16:02.712
I don't know what
you're talking about.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.047
Oh.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.132
You can't say
'cause we're on camera.

16:08.677 --> 16:10.887
<i>Insightful.</i>

16:16.685 --> 16:18.603
A little late for me
to start cooking.

16:18.687 --> 16:20.939
- Why don't we stop somewhere for dinner?
- Really?

16:21.022 --> 16:23.525
The five of us?
That's kind of pricey.

16:23.608 --> 16:26.820
Would you rather
buy a fishing boat?

16:26.903 --> 16:28.343
You're a blabbermouth,
you know that?

16:30.031 --> 16:32.117
Missy, we're gonna
eat in a restaurant.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.451
Where would you
like to go?

16:33.535 --> 16:34.911
I get to pick?

16:34.995 --> 16:37.163
- Mm-hm?
- Why don't I get to pick?

16:37.247 --> 16:38.557
Because your sister's
getting to pick.

16:38.581 --> 16:40.458
It's not just about you
in this house.

16:41.459 --> 16:42.836
What do you think, baby?

16:42.919 --> 16:44.546
I pick...

16:45.171 --> 16:46.589
Red Lobster.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.425
You got it.

16:49.092 --> 16:50.510
Damn.

16:50.593 --> 16:52.053
There goes our per diem.

16:59.102 --> 17:01.730
<i>Out of an
I formation, it's the option...</i>

17:01.813 --> 17:03.148
George, you got a minute?

17:03.231 --> 17:04.816
- What's up?
- Not you.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.402
- Him.
- What?

17:07.484 --> 17:09.988
Sheldon told me that we get paid
to go to that college

17:10.070 --> 17:11.573
and answer their questions.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.282
Yeah, so?

17:13.366 --> 17:15.617
I want to know
how much we're making.

17:16.493 --> 17:17.579
Why?

17:17.662 --> 17:19.122
'Cause I want my fair share.

17:19.748 --> 17:21.499
Is that so?

17:22.041 --> 17:23.877
What do you think
your fair share is?

17:23.960 --> 17:25.086
Half.

17:25.920 --> 17:28.214
Hm, guess that sounds right.

17:28.298 --> 17:29.799
So how much are we making?

17:30.550 --> 17:32.510
$7.50 a week.

17:32.594 --> 17:34.804
- Really?
- Really.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.973
Well, I want half that.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.224
Which is?

17:39.934 --> 17:41.144
Hang on.

17:41.978 --> 17:43.438
Sheldon!

17:44.147 --> 17:45.440
Can we put on <i>Soul Train?</i>

17:45.523 --> 17:46.733
Why?

17:46.816 --> 17:49.360
There's a girl on there
I kind of want to marry.
