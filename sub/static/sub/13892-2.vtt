00:10.790 --> 00:11.690
Alright, listen up!

00:11.760 --> 00:13.860
We've got this birthday party today, so...

00:13.860 --> 00:15.730
lots to do.

00:15.890 --> 00:17.430
Muscle Man, High Five Ghost,

00:17.460 --> 00:20.000
you're in charge of picking up the special entertainment.

00:22.450 --> 00:24.600
Skips, you set up the bouncy castle.

00:24.610 --> 00:25.150
Hmm.

00:26.870 --> 00:28.770
Let's see, I'm picking up the kids,

00:28.780 --> 00:29.570
so...

00:29.580 --> 00:32.390
Mordecai and Rigby, you set up the chairs.

00:34.520 --> 00:36.920
Oh, what about me?

00:36.930 --> 00:40.800
Surely, I'm invited to my own birthday party!

00:40.870 --> 00:43.550
Um, your birthday was last week, remember?

00:43.630 --> 00:45.340
It's a kid's party today.

00:45.390 --> 00:48.360
I still have balloons!

00:48.360 --> 00:50.710
We've got it covered, Pops!

00:50.710 --> 00:52.730
Oh. I see.

00:56.900 --> 00:59.460
Dude, how come we always
get stuck with the lame jobs?

00:59.460 --> 01:00.650
Setting up the chairs?!

01:00.650 --> 01:02.100
Lame!

01:02.100 --> 01:04.989
I can't trust you guys with something actually important.

01:04.989 --> 01:06.480
You're always slacking off.

01:06.480 --> 01:07.750
You calling us slackers?

01:07.750 --> 01:08.830
Did he? Did you?

01:08.830 --> 01:10.000
He's calling us slackers.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.110
Look dude, we can totally set up
all those chairs without slacking off.

01:13.110 --> 01:15.040
Good. Do it then.

01:15.040 --> 01:15.910
We will.

01:15.910 --> 01:16.810
Yeah,

01:16.810 --> 01:19.060
and then next time you'll
get someone else

01:19.060 --> 01:20.780
to set up the chairs?

01:22.820 --> 01:23.740
Fine.

01:25.640 --> 01:30.110
Not settin' up the chairs next time!

01:31.420 --> 01:33.090
Just set up the chairs.

01:33.800 --> 01:37.120
Benson's gonna drop his balls when
he sees how good we set up these chairs,

01:37.120 --> 01:39.450
he's gonna be all like "Oh no, my gumballs."

01:41.520 --> 01:43.620
We rule at settin' up the chairs.

01:44.240 --> 01:45.140
One.

01:46.330 --> 01:47.570
One!

01:49.460 --> 01:51.550
Yeah dude, this sucks.

01:57.770 --> 01:59.030
All right.

01:59.980 --> 02:01.790
Must be nice to be the boss.

02:01.790 --> 02:03.830
Benson never has to do chores.

02:11.160 --> 02:15.120
- Happy birthday Jimm...
- Just drive the bus, you crazy slop jockey!

02:20.510 --> 02:22.460
What the H dude!?

02:23.890 --> 02:26.450
Can we please just focus?

02:27.780 --> 02:30.290
When you say that, it makes me tired.

02:30.290 --> 02:31.110
Dude!

02:31.910 --> 02:33.180
You sound like Benson.

02:33.180 --> 02:34.750
Dude! Listen.

02:34.800 --> 02:38.200
If we pound through this, we'll
never have to do this lame chair stuff again.

02:39.040 --> 02:40.800
Next time it could be us picking up...

02:40.800 --> 02:44.050
The special entertainment!

02:51.200 --> 02:53.670
We are here to pick you up.

03:00.200 --> 03:01.480
Just a second.

03:01.550 --> 03:03.480
...who's at da door?

03:05.770 --> 03:07.540
Whoa it's bright!

03:12.170 --> 03:15.370
You know who likes special entertainment like that?

03:15.900 --> 03:17.600
My mom!

03:18.110 --> 03:20.100
Could I borrow five bucks?

03:20.590 --> 03:21.540
37..

03:22.560 --> 03:23.450
38..

03:24.530 --> 03:25.200
38..

03:25.910 --> 03:26.800
Rigby!

03:26.800 --> 03:28.270
That's all the chairs dude.

03:28.270 --> 03:29.800
There's supposed to be fifty!

03:29.850 --> 03:31.720
That's Benson's problem.

03:31.790 --> 03:34.300
No dude, that's our problem.

03:34.760 --> 03:36.790
C'mon, we've gotta find the rest.

03:36.860 --> 03:39.720
Fine! Let's find your stupid chairs.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.870
It won't open, let's get out of here.

03:43.870 --> 03:45.540
Did you try the actual door knob?

03:45.690 --> 03:49.090
AAGGHHH! You're killing me!

03:50.010 --> 03:53.060
It's locked, let's do something else.

03:53.060 --> 03:54.970
C'mon dude, take this seriously.

03:54.970 --> 03:56.810
Uh! It is locked.

03:57.820 --> 03:59.680
We've gotta get those chairs.

04:04.140 --> 04:06.330
Agh, you see the chairs?

04:06.330 --> 04:08.170
Even better.

04:08.170 --> 04:09.150

04:12.750 --> 04:14.900
It's like old school heaven!

04:14.900 --> 04:16.899

04:24.390 --> 04:25.670
Who cares, let's play!

04:25.670 --> 04:28.510
No dude! Dude, no!

04:28.740 --> 04:31.080
You want Benson to think we're slackers forever?

04:31.120 --> 04:33.410
I don't know. Do you want to be boring forever?

04:33.410 --> 04:35.290
Not cool dude!

04:35.290 --> 04:37.450
Whatever! I'm takin' my break.

04:39.650 --> 04:42.950
Dude, you're not even doing it right.
You're just mashing the buttons.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.660
Whatever, why don't
you go back to work?

04:44.660 --> 04:44.680
I know, how 'bout I take my break too?
Whatever, why don't
you go back to work?

04:44.680 --> 04:46.680
I know, how 'bout I take my break too?

04:48.320 --> 04:49.910

05:18.450 --> 05:21.220
Wait man, what about that one?

05:24.800 --> 05:26.570
Didn't they teach you how to read?

05:26.620 --> 05:28.570
Out of order.

05:30.540 --> 05:36.910
Whoooaaa! This... looks... awesome!!!

05:38.130 --> 05:39.920
Yeah whatever, it's broken.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.510
Probably because people couldn't
stop playing it cause it's so awesome!

05:45.090 --> 05:47.780
How are you gonna fix that
with your third grade education?

05:47.780 --> 05:51.390
Hey! Why don't you go ask
Benson to tell you what to do?

05:53.080 --> 05:54.810
Move over Rigby!

05:58.930 --> 06:06.270
"In the name of all that is holy,
don't connect the red wire to the blue wire"?

06:11.090 --> 06:12.700
I don't think we should do this.

06:16.760 --> 06:18.480
C'mon c'mon!

06:25.660 --> 06:26.940
Dude, what just happened?

06:27.020 --> 06:27.670
I don't know.

06:42.040 --> 06:43.830
That can't be good.

06:43.830 --> 06:45.540
I don't know, it could be cool.

06:48.970 --> 06:50.770
Oh man, we're so dead.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.150
Maybe no one will notice.

06:55.020 --> 06:58.180
Oh, who unleashed the Destroyer of Worlds?

06:58.180 --> 06:59.620
Good show!

07:00.590 --> 07:02.310
We better go find Skips.

07:04.150 --> 07:05.700
Skips, uh dude.

07:05.700 --> 07:07.170
What did you guys do?

07:07.170 --> 07:08.490
What? Nothing. Heh.

07:12.480 --> 07:14.270
You ignored my note, didn't you?

07:14.350 --> 07:15.910
A note? What note?

07:15.910 --> 07:17.090
You mean like a musical note?

07:18.530 --> 07:21.690
You fools! Destroyer of Worlds will kill us all!

07:24.360 --> 07:26.050
I have an idea, but I need time.

07:26.120 --> 07:27.270
Distract it!

07:27.270 --> 07:28.150
Wait, what?

07:28.200 --> 07:29.370
Distract it how?

07:31.400 --> 07:32.570
Get outta here!

07:39.500 --> 07:41.110
We're here.

07:42.220 --> 07:44.750
It's the special entertainment!

07:52.910 --> 07:58.660
Hey kids.
Get ready for our very special entertainment!

08:07.080 --> 08:08.720
We're screwed.

08:09.230 --> 08:10.160
Get in!

08:14.280 --> 08:17.550
Climb on top but don't
press start until i say.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.070
Skips my good man!

08:27.220 --> 08:28.900
I lost my balloons.

08:28.900 --> 08:30.090
Take the wheel.

08:31.590 --> 08:34.510
It must be my birthday!

08:35.360 --> 08:38.789
Okay everyone, press your start buttons on three.

08:38.830 --> 08:41.799
One, two, three!

08:53.980 --> 08:55.720
Mordecai and I got the arms,

08:55.770 --> 08:57.390
Rigby, you got the legs.

08:57.390 --> 08:58.810
Aw what, legs?!

08:58.810 --> 09:01.220
Legs suck man,
this is worse than the chairs!

09:02.860 --> 09:04.500
Dude, quit mashing the buttons,

09:04.500 --> 09:05.440
you're messing up the legs!

09:05.440 --> 09:06.720
SHUT UP!

09:09.790 --> 09:11.580
Drive, Pops, drive!

09:11.580 --> 09:13.980
This is so much fun!

09:21.300 --> 09:22.360
Skips!

09:22.540 --> 09:24.580
Pops stop, we lost Skips!

09:25.830 --> 09:26.810
Skips!

09:28.520 --> 09:30.030

09:30.030 --> 09:31.480
Dude, you kill the Destroyer of Worlds,

09:31.480 --> 09:32.810
I'm gonna go get the chairs!

09:32.810 --> 09:35.050
It's too dangerous, just leave them!

09:35.150 --> 09:38.440
I don't care, we're not slackers!

09:39.750 --> 09:41.570
MORDECAI!

09:52.080 --> 09:54.980
The button mashing's working!
Finish him off dude!

10:13.400 --> 10:15.880
That was some pretty sweet button mashing.

10:16.060 --> 10:17.900
I told you I got skills.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.190
YOU!!!!!!

10:21.370 --> 10:22.760
Whoa, hey Benson!

10:22.860 --> 10:24.110
Before you freak out,

10:24.140 --> 10:26.090
we totally set up those chairs.

10:27.880 --> 10:30.410
Whoo! This birthday party's hot!

So we're cool right?

10:31.710 --> 10:33.070
