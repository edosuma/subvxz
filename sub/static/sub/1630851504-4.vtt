tremendous problems.

rust on the floor.

00:11.086 --> 00:12.402

00:12.421 --> 00:14.680
- This would have to be
a project of love

00:14.907 --> 00:17.424
'cause financially,
it's gonna make no sense.

00:17.576 --> 00:19.184
- Come on, mike.
Bring out that beautiful jeep.

00:19.411 --> 00:20.427
- You have got to be
kidding me.

00:20.579 --> 00:22.837
- Wow.
That is dope.

00:22.931 --> 00:24.581
- Unbelievable.

- Let's go.

Adam, what's happening, bro?

00:58.284 --> 00:59.800
- Really?

00:59.894 --> 01:01.543
You know, I always love
taking in a new project, man.

01:01.637 --> 01:04.471
But taking in a project that
was already in another shop

01:04.565 --> 01:07.124
And not completed,
not my favorite thing to do.

01:07.142 --> 01:09.884
You see, already I got a client
that's in a bad mood

01:09.978 --> 01:11.570
'cause stuff wasn't done right.

01:11.721 --> 01:14.798
Now we get to fix everything

with ryan and adam,

At a shop
for an awfully long time

01:23.976 --> 01:25.809
And was supposed
to be getting done

01:25.828 --> 01:28.754
And couldn't get it done
and sent it to us.

01:28.905 --> 01:32.149
And the description
from them was,

01:32.242 --> 01:34.501
They kind of thought
they had a car

01:34.653 --> 01:36.002
That was almost finished.

01:52.947 --> 01:55.763

01:55.783 --> 01:58.008

02:00.770 --> 02:02.179

<i> That could please</i>

02:13.542 --> 02:17.377
<i> And the 1968 model year still</i>
<i> stands as a crowd favorite.</i>

02:17.529 --> 02:19.621
<i> The 1968</i>
<i> was a complete redesign</i>

02:19.715 --> 02:21.031
<i> From the previous year</i>

02:21.049 --> 02:22.641
<i> And featured curvier</i>
<i> body lines,</i>

02:22.792 --> 02:24.959
<i> A shorter wheelbase,</i>
<i> a longer hood,</i>

02:25.053 --> 02:27.146
<i> And a semi-fastback roofline.</i>

02:27.373 --> 02:29.389

02:29.483 --> 02:32.317

<i> Coveted title of top</i>
<i> performance car of the year.</i>

02:53.990 --> 02:55.565
- I've put it on the lift,

02:55.659 --> 02:58.660
And I have found
tremendous problems.

02:58.754 --> 03:01.571
So there's rust in the floor...

03:01.665 --> 03:04.165
- Rust?
- Bondo on the front fender.

03:04.259 --> 03:08.578
It's missing suspension grille,
headlights, drivetrain,

03:08.597 --> 03:10.022
Turn--there's no parts.

03:10.249 --> 03:13.341
And the interior got done.
The guy subbed it out.

03:13.435 --> 03:16.603
So he did a nice job on the
seats, nice job on the top.

03:16.755 --> 03:18.922
But that was a different shop.
So I actually called that guy,

03:18.941 --> 03:21.107
'cause his phone number
was on a receipt.

03:21.202 --> 03:22.850
And that he did good.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.611
- Well, yeah,
I mean, the top looks nice.

03:24.763 --> 03:26.521
Have we seen
any of the interior?

03:26.615 --> 03:27.614
- Yes.
- I mean, it's all wrapped up.

03:27.766 --> 03:29.433
- Yeah.
- I've pulled it apart.

03:29.526 --> 03:31.101
Door panels.
The stitching is nice.

03:31.194 --> 03:33.378
The edges are nice;
like, the leather's tight.

03:33.605 --> 03:34.713
It's in good shape.

03:34.940 --> 03:35.956
- So it ended up
at a good upholstery shop.

03:36.050 --> 03:37.549
- Yes.

03:37.776 --> 03:39.459
- But other than that...
- There's already shrinkage,

03:39.611 --> 03:41.220
Looks like lacquer check.

03:41.447 --> 03:43.129
So I'm assuming they just
sprayed over old lacquer.

03:43.282 --> 03:44.556
- I mean,
literally nothing fits.

03:44.783 --> 03:46.633
- Well, I don't think they even
pre-fit anything,

03:46.785 --> 03:48.393
Because--so the inner fender

03:48.620 --> 03:50.454
That's supposed to be
spot-welded...

03:50.472 --> 03:51.471
- Yeah.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.898
- Is not even hooked up.

03:53.125 --> 03:55.125
And then there's about
a half an inch of bondo,

03:55.218 --> 03:57.218
And that sounds like wood.

03:57.312 --> 04:00.054
- Oh,
that is a half an inch bondo.

04:00.074 --> 04:01.648
- Oh, my gosh.

04:01.742 --> 04:06.411
- Yeah. I found that
on the quarter. We will--it's--

04:06.638 --> 04:08.062
- Do we have all the parts
for this car?

04:08.156 --> 04:09.656
- No, this is it.
- This is it?

04:09.808 --> 04:11.566
Like, everything's missing?

04:11.585 --> 04:13.643
- Yeah. Oh, and it's not like
it's a budget build.

04:13.737 --> 04:15.312
- No.
- Mind you, they wanted ls2

04:15.405 --> 04:19.165
Supercharged,
4l80, posi, big brakes.

04:19.260 --> 04:20.984
They want the whole nine, like,
pro-touring...

04:21.077 --> 04:22.427
- And we don't have
any of that.

04:22.579 --> 04:24.263
- Like, bagged, billet wheels,
the whole nine.

04:24.490 --> 04:26.247
- That's, like,
$50,000 in parts alone.

04:26.341 --> 04:27.766
- Just in parts.
- Just in parts.

04:27.917 --> 04:29.993
- Just in parts, right.
- And none of that's here.

04:30.086 --> 04:31.419
- I know they were
under the impression

04:31.513 --> 04:33.497
That this was,
put the drivetrain in,

04:33.590 --> 04:34.773
And put it together,
and let's go.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.333
- Yeah. Yes.

04:36.351 --> 04:37.517
- But we're missing
all of these parts.

04:37.669 --> 04:39.093
We don't even
have a drivetrain.

04:39.113 --> 04:40.687
We're missing
half the suspension.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.431
We're missing all the trim,
all the stuff, all the grille.

04:43.525 --> 04:46.510
The drivetrain,
it's like a $25,000,

04:46.528 --> 04:48.345
$30,000 drivetrain.
It's not even here.

04:48.438 --> 04:49.846
So I sure hope
they didn't pay for it.

04:49.865 --> 04:51.348
But unfortunately,
I think they might have.

04:51.441 --> 04:54.108
It's--it's sad.
It's a high-dollar bill.

04:54.202 --> 04:56.703
It wasn't like these people
were, like, cutting corners.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.798
They were trying to build
a really, really nice car.

05:00.025 --> 05:02.859
- Well, it's a great car.
And it looks like a car

05:02.952 --> 05:05.119
That would be
a fantastic car to start on.

05:05.213 --> 05:07.197
- Yes.
- But I can only imagine

05:07.215 --> 05:12.035
How much money these people
already have in this car.

05:12.054 --> 05:17.390
I hate--I really hate being
the shop that has to be

05:17.543 --> 05:19.484
The bearer of bad news...
- Yeah.

05:19.636 --> 05:22.045
- And has to clean up
after somebody else's mess.

05:22.138 --> 05:24.047
Because then the client
is wondering,

05:24.066 --> 05:26.232
"well, wait a minute,
who's--who's really taking me

05:26.385 --> 05:27.642
For a ride here?"
- yeah.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.052
- Man,
they got taken for a ride.

05:29.071 --> 05:32.072
This would have to be
a project of love.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.499
'cause financially
it's gonna make no sense.

05:34.726 --> 05:36.409
<i> You know, I really don't like</i>
<i> ragging on other shops.</i>

05:36.562 --> 05:38.003
It's just not my style.

05:38.154 --> 05:40.488
But when I see stuff like this,
it gets under my skin.

05:40.582 --> 05:42.415
This car deserves
to be treated right.

05:42.568 --> 05:45.919

things like that.

06:45.572 --> 06:48.148

- So...

06:50.059 --> 06:51.743

We're gonna supercharge them
both, give 'em some muscle.

And we're gonna do
all the cool guy things,

07:05.074 --> 07:06.650
The lift kit,
the big wheels and tires,

07:06.743 --> 07:09.261
The oversized bumpers,
the light bars,

07:09.488 --> 07:12.597
Yeah, just really make 'em
look, like, rugged and tough.

07:12.749 --> 07:15.767
- Fun, utilitarian,
looking good.

07:15.919 --> 07:17.160
- Correct.
- All right.

07:17.253 --> 07:18.662
- Even thinking about
doing things

07:18.755 --> 07:21.498
Like adding auxiliary gas
cans and winches

07:21.591 --> 07:23.516
And just really making 'em
wicked.

07:23.669 --> 07:24.776
This gonna just be fun.

07:25.003 --> 07:25.518
- Yeah.
- So no--no upholstery?

07:25.612 --> 07:27.170
- No upholstery.

07:27.263 --> 07:28.280
- What about stereo?
We gonna do stereo in 'em?

07:28.507 --> 07:29.781
- You know,
that's a good question.

07:29.933 --> 07:31.191
I'll find out from the guy.
- Okay. All right.

07:31.285 --> 07:32.676
- Yeah, 'cause they're on
a ranch; they're gonna need,

07:32.769 --> 07:33.935
Like, communication, radio...
- Maybe cbs or two-ways.

07:34.029 --> 07:36.029
- Cbs.
- Oh, dude, I like that.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.682
We'll throw that idea at them.
I think that's a good idea.

- We don't know what
they're gonna do with the.

07:41.110 --> 07:42.461
I mean, they might
auction them off,

07:42.612 --> 07:43.295
Or they might just
have them there

07:43.446 --> 07:44.779
For the camp freedom guys.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.372
- Right.

07:46.467 --> 07:49.359
So, ryan, here's the part
that you're really gonna like

07:49.377 --> 07:51.136
If you already have
not figured it out.

07:51.287 --> 07:53.972
Comes down to paint.
Each one will carry the theme.

07:54.123 --> 07:55.474
One will have
the military theme,

07:55.625 --> 07:58.051
The other one will have
the first-responder theme.

07:58.203 --> 07:59.536
And what you're going to dig
about this--

07:59.554 --> 08:01.054
- I already dig.
I know what's coming.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.223
- Right. These are the colors.

08:03.375 --> 08:05.132
- They're painted.
- They're--right, exactly.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.467
- Yeah, yeah.
- We're not doing

08:06.487 --> 08:08.803
Any color change.
This one's gonna stay red.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.381

24:40.146 --> 24:42.980
<i> And on top of that, we added</i>

matt, dave, and john.

24:51.157 --> 24:52.990
Matt, you've obviously
been here with me before.

24:53.217 --> 24:55.551
- Absolutely.
- 'cause we did a wicked nova.

24:55.569 --> 24:57.236
<i> - Incredible.</i>

24:57.330 --> 25:00.072
This is so far beyond anything
that I ever thought of.

25:00.224 --> 25:01.907
This is incredible.

25:02.001 --> 25:04.226
- You guys raffled it off.
- We did. We raffled it off.

25:04.319 --> 25:06.319
It raised
a tremendous amount of money.

25:06.413 --> 25:08.339
$300,000 for camp freedom.

25:08.566 --> 25:09.898
- Thank god.

25:09.992 --> 25:11.324
- Thank you for
doing that for us.

25:11.344 --> 25:13.827
- It's my honor because
of what camp freedom does.

25:13.846 --> 25:16.405
Camp freedom is
a magnificent organization

25:16.498 --> 25:21.076
Based in pennsylvania,
supports our vets

25:21.169 --> 25:22.594
And our first responders.
- Absolutely.

25:22.688 --> 25:25.839
- If it wasn't for our military
and first responders,

25:25.858 --> 25:27.691
We would not be able to do
the things we do.

25:27.918 --> 25:28.917
- True american heroes.
- Amen.

25:28.936 --> 25:30.194
- True american heroes.

25:30.421 --> 25:32.104
- And I'm standing here
with military men.

25:32.198 --> 25:34.439
Please tell me, brother,

25:34.592 --> 25:35.866
What was your branch
in service?

25:36.093 --> 25:37.368

for eight years

25:37.519 --> 25:39.019
In the 82nd airborne.
- 82nd airborne in the army.

25:39.113 --> 25:40.763
- Yes, sir.
- Good god.

25:40.856 --> 25:42.781
- Best unit in the army.
- Hey, man,

25:42.875 --> 25:44.600
God bless you,
and thank you for your service.

25:44.693 --> 25:45.784
- I appreciate it.

25:45.936 --> 25:47.603
- Marine corps.

25:47.621 --> 25:49.547

25:49.774 --> 25:53.442

- So what's gonna happen

25:54.612 --> 25:55.702

25:55.796 --> 25:57.388

25:57.539 --> 26:00.616
We're gonna raffle
both vehicles in one raffle.

26:00.634 --> 26:01.950

33:05.392 --> 33:07.058
<i> A beautiful car, man,</i>

33:07.211 --> 33:08.543
<i> But another shop started</i>
<i> on it,</i>

33:08.562 --> 33:09.969
<i> And they had messed it all up.</i>

33:10.063 --> 33:11.730
<i> '68 olds cutlass.</i>

33:11.882 --> 33:13.548
<i> You know, I'm not the biggest</i>
<i> fan of taking over jobs</i>

33:13.567 --> 33:16.067
<i> That come from another shop,</i>
<i> but the client wanted a car</i>

33:16.161 --> 33:17.385
<i> That would pay tribute</i>
<i> to his dad's memory.</i>

33:17.404 --> 33:19.070
<i> And that's something</i>
<i> that frankly</i>

33:19.223 --> 33:21.239
<i> I can really relate to,</i>
<i> so we took her in,</i>

33:21.333 --> 33:23.408
<i> And my guys got straight</i>
<i> to work on it, man.</i>

33:23.560 --> 33:25.168
<i> We turned this car inside out</i>

33:25.320 --> 33:27.004
<i> Fixing her up the way</i>
<i> she deserved to be.</i>

33:27.155 --> 33:28.747
She's finally done.

33:28.841 --> 33:30.841
And frankly, she may be
one of the finest builds

33:30.992 --> 33:32.067
We have ever done.

33:32.085 --> 33:34.252
<i> I just now received some news</i>

33:34.404 --> 33:36.421
<i> That I think my team needs</i>
<i> to hear directly from me.</i>

33:36.515 --> 33:39.758
So I called a meeting
to bring everyone up to speed.

33:39.910 --> 33:42.001
Here's the thing, man. I wanted
to call everybody together,

33:42.021 --> 33:44.913
'cause this is
an interesting day.

33:44.931 --> 33:46.506
Why this is an interesting day,

33:46.600 --> 33:49.584
We all know we've been working
really hard on an incredible

33:49.677 --> 33:52.771
'68 olds cutlass convertible.

33:52.923 --> 33:57.517
So the owner of the car,
terrence "shug" brown,

33:57.536 --> 34:01.930
This cat was building this car
in honor of his father,

34:01.948 --> 34:04.207
Ernest harris jr.

34:04.359 --> 34:06.101
Well, you know, his father,
you know, had passed away.

34:06.119 --> 34:09.713
So that's why terrence
"shug" brown was doing the car

34:09.864 --> 34:11.456
Just kind of as a tribute.

34:11.608 --> 34:14.051
Tragically here recently
terrence just passed away.

34:14.202 --> 34:15.277
- What?
- What?

34:15.370 --> 34:16.386
- Yeah.
- We just talked to him.

34:16.613 --> 34:17.796
- Yeah, literally.
- I know. I know.

34:17.890 --> 34:19.556
- It was, like, two weeks ago.
- Yeah. Yeah.

34:19.707 --> 34:22.726
I honestly don't know
the details.

34:22.877 --> 34:25.044
Kind of falls under none
of my business,

34:25.064 --> 34:27.455
But, you know,
the family's obviously

34:27.474 --> 34:30.975
Very tore up, and so,
you know, nothing but respect.

34:31.128 --> 34:34.738
So this car has now become
kind of a double tribute here.

34:34.965 --> 34:37.407
- It was a sudden thing.
It was unexpected.

34:37.559 --> 34:39.301
And the way this car
turned out,

34:39.319 --> 34:43.080
I just wish he could have
seen it for five seconds.

34:43.307 --> 34:45.156
- Yeah, yeah.
- 'cause it was his dream.

34:45.250 --> 34:49.661
- We're working with--with
shug's daughter on the car

34:49.755 --> 34:52.255
Getting sent back
to the family and everything.

34:52.407 --> 34:56.909
But in the meantime,
before we load this ride p

34:57.003 --> 34:58.595
And before we ship it off,

34:58.746 --> 35:02.432
I kind of figured we get
the a-team together here,

35:02.659 --> 35:05.585
And let's check out
the car one final time

35:05.604 --> 35:07.011
Before we send this thing off.

35:07.164 --> 35:09.180
But I was going down
a checklist here, man.

35:09.274 --> 35:12.834
I cannot believe everything
we've done on this car.

35:12.853 --> 35:14.594
I mean, this car is amazing.

35:14.613 --> 35:17.172
There's an ls3 in this thing
that kenne bell supercharged,

35:17.190 --> 35:18.448
700-plus horse?

35:18.600 --> 35:19.950
- Yes, sir. About 700,

35:20.177 --> 35:21.618
I believe a little bit
over 700 horsepower.

35:21.769 --> 35:25.363
- 700 horse, 645 foot-pounds
of torque,

35:25.457 --> 35:29.108
4l75-e trans
to back up all that horsepower.

35:29.202 --> 35:30.293
You got the borla exhaust.

35:30.520 --> 35:31.795
You got ron davis radiator
to keep it cool.

35:31.946 --> 35:34.447
Suspension, hotchkis, man.

35:34.466 --> 35:36.633
This is not a '68
olds anymore, man.

35:36.860 --> 35:40.695
This is a world-class
performance machine.

35:40.788 --> 35:43.140
And again,
god bless terrence.

35:43.291 --> 35:45.216
You know, he pulled out
all the stops.

35:45.310 --> 35:48.887
He had already been taken
for a ride at another shop.

35:49.039 --> 35:50.388
- They got ripped off.
- Yes.

35:50.540 --> 35:51.631
And it allegedly had
a whole bunch of stuff.

35:51.650 --> 35:52.983
- Except--except
for the interior.

35:53.210 --> 35:54.967
- Giving credit where
credit's due, man.

35:55.061 --> 35:57.487
The previous upholstery guy who
started it, he did a good job.

35:57.639 --> 35:59.714
- He did.
- I want us all to give it

35:59.807 --> 36:02.717
A good look around...
- Okay.

36:02.736 --> 36:03.493
- And then we're gonna load
this baby up

36:03.645 --> 36:04.828
And send it to the family.

36:04.979 --> 36:05.737
Let's go take a look
at this thing.

36:05.831 --> 36:06.905
- Let's go look.

36:07.057 --> 36:08.314
- I think cody's
still cleaning it.

36:08.333 --> 36:09.649
- Is he cleaning?
- Yeah, it's out here

36:09.668 --> 36:11.168
In the sunshine,
where it should be,

36:11.395 --> 36:14.337
'cause, man,
that pearl paint, is gorgeous.

36:14.564 --> 36:17.823
Perfect for that paint job.
It's gorgeous.

36:17.843 --> 36:19.176
I think cody's finishing up.
Cleaned it up.

36:19.327 --> 36:20.735
Yeah, there he is.

36:20.828 --> 36:22.179
- Wow.
- How's it going, cody?

36:22.330 --> 36:23.254
Looking beautiful.

36:23.407 --> 36:26.408
- Whoo.
- Good lord.

36:26.426 --> 36:28.092
- That pearl just glows
in the sun.

36:28.187 --> 36:30.187
- Look at this thing,
gentlemen. Good lord.

36:30.338 --> 36:31.763
- Wow.
- Beautiful.

36:31.915 --> 36:33.264
- Stunning.

36:33.417 --> 36:35.767
<i> This 1968 oldsmobile cutlass</i>
<i> started out</i>

36:35.919 --> 36:37.677
<i> As a labor of pure love</i>

36:37.696 --> 36:39.196
<i> And became a sort of</i>
<i> double tribute</i>

36:39.423 --> 36:42.014
<i> To two car guys</i>
<i> that we lost too soon.</i>

36:42.034 --> 36:45.368
<i> The fab team totally knocked</i>
<i> this one out of the park.</i>

36:45.595 --> 36:47.445
<i> We stripped the body</i>
<i> down to bare metal</i>

36:47.597 --> 36:49.781
<i> And brought it back</i>
<i> to factory steel.</i>

36:49.875 --> 36:53.451
<i> Under the hood, we dropped</i>
<i> the chevy ls3 v8 engine</i>

36:53.545 --> 36:56.938
<i> With a kenne bell superchargr</i>
<i> and borla exhaust</i>

36:56.957 --> 37:01.218
<i> And backed it up with a chevy</i>
<i> 4l75-e automatic transmission,</i>

37:01.445 --> 37:03.369
<i> Added a hotchkis</i>
<i> suspension system</i>

37:03.388 --> 37:04.963
<i> With mickey thompson tires.</i>

37:05.115 --> 37:07.131
<i> Ryan and the paint shop</i>
<i> did a fantastic job</i>

37:07.226 --> 37:10.301
<i> Laying down a wicked</i>
<i> gm white diamond pearl</i>

37:10.454 --> 37:12.378
<i> That just beams</i>
<i> in the sunlight.</i>

37:12.472 --> 37:15.473
<i> And with that gorgeous maroon</i>
<i> ragtop and matching</i>

37:15.625 --> 37:17.792
<i> Rocker stripes,</i>
<i> it just sets this baby off</i>

37:17.811 --> 37:19.385
<i> In all the right ways.</i>

37:19.404 --> 37:21.646
<i> Ghetto bob nailed</i>
<i> that old-school vibe</i>

37:21.798 --> 37:24.390
<i> With a killer console</i>
<i> sporting restomod air,</i>

37:24.409 --> 37:26.910
<i> And a thumping dls</i>
<i> sound system.</i>

37:27.061 --> 37:29.320
<i> This might be</i>
<i> the baddest cutlass</i>

37:29.473 --> 37:33.141
<i> That we've ever put out.</i>
<i> Man, this thing is beautiful.</i>

37:33.159 --> 37:36.086
- The color combo is stunning.
- Yep.

37:36.237 --> 37:38.663
- The stance is perfect.

37:38.815 --> 37:41.499
The wheel and tire combo
is right on the money.

37:41.651 --> 37:43.501
All the time spent
in metal fab,

37:43.653 --> 37:44.986
I mean,
look at those body lines.

37:45.079 --> 37:46.154
Look at the--look
at the panels;

37:46.172 --> 37:48.656
Look at the fit and the finish.

37:48.675 --> 37:51.342
- Lonnie's paint just glows
in the sun.

37:51.495 --> 37:52.752
- It's a white--it's
a white diamond, right?

37:52.771 --> 37:54.587
- That's--
gm white diamond.

37:54.681 --> 37:59.776
And then between the--the dark
brandywine, candy stripe,

37:59.927 --> 38:01.669
And the maroogundy stripe.

38:01.688 --> 38:03.338
- Yeah.

38:03.356 --> 38:05.189
- Kind of coordinated the top
and the leather interior

38:05.342 --> 38:07.191
All on the side of the car.

38:07.286 --> 38:10.936
- This might be a top-three car
that we've done.

38:10.956 --> 38:12.530
I'm gonna agree with you, kev.

38:12.624 --> 38:14.365
Frankie, let's see--let's see
under here, man.

38:14.518 --> 38:16.442
- Yes, sir.

38:16.536 --> 38:17.368
- 'cause I know there's a whole
lot of happy under this hood,

38:17.521 --> 38:19.854
And I can't believe it fits.

38:19.947 --> 38:21.189
- Barely.
- Look at this.

38:21.207 --> 38:22.465
Good lord.

38:22.617 --> 38:24.283
- That shocked the hell
out of me.

38:24.303 --> 38:25.468
When I came around the corner
and bob was working on it

38:25.695 --> 38:27.804
And saw that,
I expected it an ls,

38:27.955 --> 38:30.882
But then seeing a kenne bell
sitting on top of it,

38:30.976 --> 38:32.534
I couldn't believe it.

38:32.552 --> 38:34.385
- The whole cooling system,
the ron davis setup

38:34.538 --> 38:36.220
Is just absolutely stunning.

38:36.315 --> 38:38.815
- Yeah, the supercharger has
a--has its own radiator.

38:38.966 --> 38:40.299
Keep it nice and cool.

38:40.319 --> 38:41.709
- It's like a separate
cooling system...

38:41.728 --> 38:42.986
- Yeah.

38:43.213 --> 38:44.212
- That just runs cooling
through the intake.

38:44.305 --> 38:45.155
- Hear that supercharger
screaming.

38:45.306 --> 38:46.564
- Yeah.
- Wahh!

38:46.658 --> 38:49.551
- It's just--it's just
stunning under there.

38:49.569 --> 38:52.662
Kudos under the hood, man,
nothing--nothing but love.

38:52.889 --> 38:54.331
Show me some interior
on this thing, man.

38:54.482 --> 38:55.406
- Let's get--
let's get in here.

38:55.559 --> 38:58.726
- Let's look at this thing.

38:58.820 --> 39:00.503
- So a lot of this stuff
was done.

39:00.655 --> 39:03.155
The other upholstery shop was
able to get us some material

39:03.175 --> 39:04.749
So we could
change thing like that.

39:04.901 --> 39:06.250
You know, and then we changed

39:06.345 --> 39:07.344
And broke up the bottom
of the doors in black.

39:07.571 --> 39:09.587
- That was a good call
on the dash.

39:09.739 --> 39:11.089
- The restomod ac setup

39:11.183 --> 39:13.516
Where you set the controls
and how you got the vents

39:13.743 --> 39:16.094
There coming out
of that center console area,

39:16.188 --> 39:20.264
The shifter, the--
your power window switches..

39:20.417 --> 39:22.767
I was just gonna say,
the wood grain wheel.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.844
- Terrence picked that out.
This is everything

39:24.863 --> 39:26.011
That he wanted in this car.
- God bless him.

39:26.031 --> 39:27.589
- He had it planned out.

39:27.607 --> 39:30.758
He had it in his hand;
he had a vision and just--

39:30.852 --> 39:32.685
It took us
to finish his dream.

39:32.704 --> 39:37.265
- The man had a great vision.
This car is stunning.

39:37.358 --> 39:38.933
- Let's see what's
in the trunk.

39:38.952 --> 39:41.603
Ryan, the color combo
and the way the stripe is,

39:41.621 --> 39:43.955
Two different colors on that.
And it's so subtle, so subtle.

39:44.107 --> 39:45.790
- Yeah. Originally, we figured

39:45.942 --> 39:48.793
He would do something like
the hearse tribute, you know,

39:48.945 --> 39:50.369
Higher up on the body line.

39:50.389 --> 39:52.722
- Are you ready for this?
- Oh, yeah, man.

39:52.874 --> 39:54.540
- Look at that. Oh, man.

39:54.559 --> 39:55.875
- Clean, functional...

39:55.969 --> 39:57.376
- Money.
- Plenty of room.

39:57.396 --> 39:59.062
He could still use it.
He could still put stuff there.

39:59.289 --> 40:01.731
- The little accent
in the color combo.

40:01.883 --> 40:04.976
Gentlemen, I just--kudos
to the team.

40:05.128 --> 40:07.145
God bless the family right now
what they're going throug.

40:07.297 --> 40:10.055
I hope and pray
that when this gets there

40:10.075 --> 40:12.575
It puts a smile on their face.

40:12.727 --> 40:14.485
This was a--this
was shug's vision--

40:14.579 --> 40:17.914
- It will. It will.
- And--and we carried it out.

40:18.141 --> 40:19.582
Great job, gentlemen.
You know what?

40:19.734 --> 40:21.567
Why don't we take it
for a quick spin

40:21.586 --> 40:23.494
Before we ship it?

40:23.647 --> 40:24.570
- Let's go. Come on.
- I'm going.

40:24.664 --> 40:25.997
- You guys enjoy.
- All right.

40:26.149 --> 40:27.757
You guys rock.
- I'm gonna watch.

40:27.984 --> 40:30.168
- You guys rock.
You guys are the best.

40:30.320 --> 40:31.243
- Can you believe these guys?

40:31.337 --> 40:32.670
- They're chicken, man.

40:32.822 --> 40:35.581
Let's do this.
- Let's go.

40:35.600 --> 40:38.176
[engine turning over]

40:38.270 --> 40:40.495
- Our client came to us
after some bad luck

40:40.513 --> 40:42.163
<i> With another shop.</i>
<i> He asked if we could make</i>

40:42.182 --> 40:44.832
<i> His '68 cutlass</i>
<i> a dream come true.</i>

40:44.851 --> 40:46.759
<i> The car truly is a dream, ma.</i>

40:46.778 --> 40:49.446
The only thing missing
is the owner, shug,

40:49.597 --> 40:51.022
And sadly could not
be here to see it.

40:51.116 --> 40:53.191
He wanted to pay homage
to his dad's memory.

40:53.343 --> 40:54.617
Well, you know, that it does.

40:54.769 --> 40:56.360
But now it does
to shug as well.

40:56.455 --> 40:59.939
Man, I am proud of my guys
for doing an amazing job.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.625
<i> I'm glad that we get to send</i>
<i> this really special car</i>

41:02.777 --> 41:04.627
<i> Back to a family</i>
<i> who will surely miss</i>

41:04.779 --> 41:07.205
The two guys now
who've inspired it.

41:07.299 --> 41:08.873
[engine revving]

41:09.025 --> 41:11.116
- [laughs]
- uh-huh, you feel that, huh?

41:11.136 --> 41:15.638
[engine revving]

41:15.790 --> 41:18.290
- [laughs]

41:18.310 --> 41:19.867
This is too much fun.

41:19.961 --> 41:21.144
- I gotta get me one of these.

41:21.295 --> 41:23.462
- This thing is beautiful.

41:23.482 --> 41:26.465
You have no idea
how much I love this thing.

41:26.485 --> 41:28.559
This thing wants to fly.

41:28.712 --> 41:31.321
- Yes. It wants to just go.

41:31.472 --> 41:33.156
- Oh, my gosh.
You know how hard it is--

41:33.383 --> 41:34.882
I'm behaving right now.
- I know. I know.

41:34.901 --> 41:36.734
- I'm so behaving right now.

41:36.828 --> 41:40.497
[engine revving]

41:40.648 --> 41:42.890
Good gracious.

41:42.909 --> 41:46.410
- This car wanted to be
what it is.

41:46.563 --> 41:48.062
It knew what it wanted.

41:48.081 --> 41:50.064
- It did.
It was in the wrong place.

41:50.083 --> 41:52.658
It came to the right place.

41:52.677 --> 41:55.178
Kudos to shug for knowing
what he wanted to do, man.

41:55.329 --> 41:58.089
- And you know he was talking
about doing more.

41:58.241 --> 41:59.849
He had, like, three other cars
he wanted to do.

42:00.001 --> 42:03.019
- Really. God bless him.
