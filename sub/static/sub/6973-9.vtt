Holy Ghost, come to me.

00:40.740 --> 00:45.404
Praise God. Praise God.
Move up on me, Holy Ghost.

00:47.113 --> 00:51.516
Praise God.
This here sinner repents.

00:51.584 --> 00:53.677
Holy Ghost, move up on me.

00:53.753 --> 00:56.620
Protect me and mine
with your quickening power.

Not as far as you know.

03:15.394 --> 03:17.328
Right.

03:17.396 --> 03:19.489
Not this time of year.

03:20.866 --> 03:23.835
All right. Thank you, Doctor. Good-bye.

03:26.005 --> 03:28.633
Snakes.

03:28.707 --> 03:30.800
Lots and lots of snakes.

03:30.876 --> 03:33.310
Very pissed-off ones,
from the look of it.

03:36.315 --> 03:40.376
It's the former Mr. Jared Chirp
of McMinn County, Tennessee.

03:40.452 --> 03:43.751
- Oh, my God.
- 116 separate bite marks.

03:43.822 --> 03:45.915
Judging from the wound measurements,

03:45.991 --> 03:49.586
there were 50 different snakes involved,
mostly copperheads and rattlers.

03:49.662 --> 03:52.153
But it says here that he
was found dead in his car.

03:52.231 --> 03:55.928
Yeah, with a pistol in his hand.
He fired six shots into the floorboards,

03:56.001 --> 03:58.731
into the passenger seat,
even into his own right kneecap.

03:58.804 --> 04:01.136
The windows were shut
and the doors were locked.

04:01.207 --> 04:03.903
But what happened
to all the snakes?

04:03.976 --> 04:07.605
No one seems to know that.
There was not a scale found.

04:07.680 --> 04:11.707
I just got off the phone with
a herpetologist at the Smithsonian,
and he's stumped,

04:11.784 --> 04:15.345
especially because these rattlesnakes
tend to hibernate in winter.

04:15.421 --> 04:19.357
So you think that
Mr. Chirp was murdered.

04:19.425 --> 04:22.622
It certainly would appear that way,
but the question is how.

04:22.695 --> 04:25.926
There's no physical evidence at all...
no tire tracks, no footprints.

04:25.998 --> 04:29.593
I can't see how anyone
could've accomplished this.
Then you gotta ask yourself why.

04:29.668 --> 04:32.262
Why would anybody use poisonous snakes
as a murder weapon?

04:32.338 --> 04:36.832
Maybe it's symbolic. I mean, serpents
and religion have gone hand in hand.

04:36.909 --> 04:40.276
They've represented
the temptation of Eve, original sin.

04:40.346 --> 04:42.678
They've been feared and hated
throughout history,

04:42.748 --> 04:47.344
as they've been thought to
embody Satan... to serve evil itself.

04:47.419 --> 04:50.354
Maybe these ones actually do.

04:50.422 --> 04:53.823
These particular serpents
actually were serving evil?

04:53.892 --> 04:57.988
Are you gonna type that
on our travel request?

04:58.063 --> 04:59.997
No.

05:00.065 --> 05:03.000
But at the very least this case
does seem to center around religion,

05:03.068 --> 05:05.502
and you're not the only one
to think that, by the way.

05:25.357 --> 05:28.884
Jared is in a better
place now, Gracie.

05:28.961 --> 05:30.895
He's at peace.

05:42.574 --> 05:45.372
You know Reverend Mackey's
right, honey.

05:45.444 --> 05:47.537
He is in a better place.

05:58.957 --> 06:01.187
Reverend Samuel Mackey?

06:02.995 --> 06:05.088
My name is Fox Mulder.
This is Dana Scully.

06:05.164 --> 06:07.530
We're with the F.B.I.
May we speak with you, sir?

06:08.767 --> 06:11.167
Come on, Gracie.
Let's get you home.

06:17.009 --> 06:21.946
We apologize for our timing.
We'd like to ask you a few
questions aboutJared Chirp.

06:22.014 --> 06:25.040
I've already spoken
to the sheriff about it,

06:25.117 --> 06:29.076
though I'm not sure that
that was a good idea.

06:29.154 --> 06:32.089
Specifically, you had suspicions
about the manner in which he died?

06:35.661 --> 06:39.495
I should be the last one to
point a finger or say a harsh word.

06:39.565 --> 06:42.432
Our church is founded on
acceptance and tolerance...

06:42.501 --> 06:45.834
- of all people, all beliefs.
- But?

06:47.973 --> 06:52.672
BeforeJared joined us,
he belonged to a fundamentalist
congregation outside of town,

06:52.745 --> 06:55.612
the Church of God
with Signs & Wonders.

06:55.681 --> 06:57.308
It practices snake handling.

06:57.383 --> 07:00.978
As a sign of faith, worshippers
handle deadly snakes or drink poison.

07:01.053 --> 07:06.491
They believe that the Holy Spirit
protects the righteous.

07:06.558 --> 07:10.255
Jared grew up in that church,
but it is very difficult...

07:10.329 --> 07:13.423
to walk away from a belief system
that one is raised in.

07:13.499 --> 07:15.660
It takes great courage.

07:15.734 --> 07:17.827
Why did he walk away?

07:17.903 --> 07:21.839
He and Gracie, his girlfriend,
left it together.

07:21.907 --> 07:27.436
They found that a rigid interpretation
of the Bible was not for them,

07:27.513 --> 07:32.382
especially when it involves risking
life and limb in the act of worship.

07:32.451 --> 07:34.885
But, again,
it is not for me to judge.

07:34.953 --> 07:39.788
I will say, however,
that both Jared and Gracie...

07:39.858 --> 07:43.191
were persecuted by the members
of their former church.

07:45.431 --> 07:47.558
All this animus...

07:47.633 --> 07:51.125
stems from their church leader,
Enoch O'Connor.

07:51.203 --> 07:53.535
Animus enough
to motivate a murder?

08:21.467 --> 08:25.927
Snake handling.
We didn't learn that in catechism class.

08:26.004 --> 08:29.440
That's funny, I knew a couple Catholic
schoolgirls who were expert at it.

08:37.182 --> 08:39.116
Enoch O'Connor?

08:39.183 --> 08:41.118
Federal agents.

08:47.326 --> 08:49.260
Where's the light switch?

08:49.328 --> 08:51.819
The nearest one?
Probably ten miles from here.

08:51.897 --> 08:53.831
Yeah.
[Chuckles]

08:56.435 --> 08:58.369
All right.

09:15.988 --> 09:18.923
Rattlesnakes and medieval visions
of damnation.

09:18.991 --> 09:21.789
I, for one, feel
a whole lot closer to God.

09:21.860 --> 09:24.727
I don't know, Scully.
When you get right down to it,

09:24.796 --> 09:27.731
is snake handling
any harder to buy into than...

09:27.799 --> 09:31.030
communion wafers
or transubstantiation...

09:31.103 --> 09:33.333
Or believing in flying saucers,
for that matter.

09:33.405 --> 09:37.739
I'm just saying that your faith
and O'Connor's seem...

09:37.809 --> 09:39.902
to be based
on the same book.

09:51.857 --> 09:54.951
Uh-oh, Scully. What do you think
O'Connor keeps in here?

09:55.027 --> 09:58.019
Something slithery?

10:01.833 --> 10:05.599
- It's all right. It's empty.
- Why is it empty?

10:06.872 --> 10:10.103
[Hissing, Rattling]

10:29.061 --> 10:31.222
By what right are you here?

10:33.699 --> 10:37.135
Reverend Enoch O'Connor,
we're federal agents.

10:37.202 --> 10:39.670
We're, uh, with the F.B.I.

10:39.738 --> 10:43.308
Reverend, do something
about these snakes, please.

10:43.441 --> 10:47.502
You got nothing to fear
if you're righteous people.

10:47.578 --> 10:49.808
Just in case we're not, we could use
a little righteous help here.

10:54.952 --> 10:57.079
What do you want?

10:57.155 --> 11:02.183
We're here to ask you questions
about a former member of
your church... Jared Chirp.

11:02.260 --> 11:06.663
That boy strayed from the path
and was lost to the Dark One.

11:06.731 --> 11:08.824
I'm sorry for his soul.

11:08.900 --> 11:12.199
- There ain't much else to say.
- He died from multiple snake bites.

11:12.270 --> 11:15.103
We thought maybe you'd have
a special insight into that.

11:17.342 --> 11:19.276
I do.

11:21.212 --> 11:25.615
- It was a test.
- Test? What do you mean?

11:25.683 --> 11:30.620
A test of faith.
A test of righteousness.

11:33.191 --> 11:37.059
When the devil aims to test you,
you best be ready.

11:37.128 --> 11:40.461
And you sure better know
which side you're on.

11:40.531 --> 11:43.898
You speaking about the devil's test
or your test?

11:43.968 --> 11:48.234
I don't think you people
realize which side you're on.

11:50.675 --> 11:52.609
I do.

11:53.778 --> 11:55.871
You can leave now.

12:07.558 --> 12:09.685
Tennessee. Snakes.

12:09.761 --> 12:13.026
Thank you, Mulder.
Thank you so much.

12:13.097 --> 12:15.463
I say we arrest him and catch
the first flight out of here.

12:15.533 --> 12:18.866
He does seem like a likely suspect,
only the local sheriff's office
ruled him out.

12:18.936 --> 12:22.030
Apparently, he was in Kentucky
the nightJared Chirp died.

12:22.106 --> 12:24.734
Mulder, there are other people
in his congregation.

12:24.809 --> 12:27.744
Jared Chirp died with
a packed suitcase by his side.

12:27.812 --> 12:30.645
There's gotta be somebody
that knows where he was headed.

12:51.135 --> 12:53.069
Here you go, honey.

13:05.850 --> 13:07.977
Reverend Mackey?

13:08.052 --> 13:12.318
- This might not be the best time,
but can I speak to you?
- Of course.

13:12.390 --> 13:15.553
Jared called the boardinghouse
late the night he died.

13:15.626 --> 13:17.958
He wanted to talk to Gracie.

13:18.029 --> 13:21.362
I didn't let him.
It was after 2:00.

13:21.432 --> 13:24.890
She was sound asleep, and it sounded
to me like the boy had been drinkin'.

13:24.969 --> 13:27.062
He just wasn't
makin' any sense.

13:27.138 --> 13:29.868
He was rantin' about seein' the devil
and payin' for his sins.

13:29.941 --> 13:32.876
Iris, why didn't you
tell the police?

13:32.944 --> 13:35.276
I don't know how
to tell Gracie.

13:35.346 --> 13:39.680
I kept her from speaking toJared
his last night on earth.

13:39.750 --> 13:42.685
I couldn't have known though.

13:42.753 --> 13:45.187
- I couldn't have.
- No, you couldn't have known.

13:46.457 --> 13:48.755
I can help you
talk to Gracie.

13:48.826 --> 13:52.091
- Reverend Mackey? Everybody's here.
- Thank you, Gracie.

13:54.565 --> 13:58.194
You and I will see this through,
Iris, right after study group.

13:58.269 --> 14:00.203
Thank you.

14:07.245 --> 14:11.511
- [O'Connor] Our God is a fearsome God.
- [Congregants] Amen!

He demands our very lives!

"'Tis better to be hot or cold
than lukewarm."

14:30.001 --> 14:32.868
[Overlapping Shouts
Of Praise]

14:34.305 --> 14:38.639
God says
if you're lukewarm...

14:38.709 --> 14:43.078
he will vomit you
out of his mouth!

14:43.147 --> 14:45.081
Yes!

14:45.149 --> 14:48.380
- Did you hear what I said?
- Praise God. Praise God.

14:48.452 --> 14:53.549
Yes.
God hates the lukewarm!

14:54.625 --> 14:57.992
"'So, because you
are lukewarm...

14:58.062 --> 15:02.499
I am about to spit you
out of my mouth."'

15:03.868 --> 15:06.336
Now, that could sound
pretty harsh, couldn't it?

15:06.404 --> 15:09.168
I mean, depending on
how one reads it.

15:09.240 --> 15:13.267
But if we put this verse
in a historical context,

15:13.344 --> 15:16.575
I think we'll see thatJohn
was specifcally addressing...

15:16.647 --> 15:19.980
the problems of
the church of Laodicea.

15:20.051 --> 15:23.452

John ends this chapter,

16:33.290 --> 16:38.626
his emphasis is on teaching the church
of Laodicea perseverance.

I don't understand it.
None of us saw or heard anything.

18:28.370 --> 18:32.830
Just her scream. When we ran in,
she was lying on the floor.

18:32.907 --> 18:37.241
I cleared everybody out of the building
once I saw the bite marks, but...

18:37.312 --> 18:39.746
Reverend, how close
was Iris toJared Chirp?

18:39.814 --> 18:42.374
Not particularly close,

18:42.450 --> 18:45.317
but I'd spoken with her
not 15 minutes earlier about him.

18:45.387 --> 18:49.118
- What'd you talk about?
- She was upset.

18:49.190 --> 18:53.286
Something aboutJared calling her
the night he died, looking for Gracie.

18:53.361 --> 18:55.921
Something about
him paying...

18:55.997 --> 18:58.363
for his sins.

18:58.433 --> 19:01.960
But I don't know. We didn't get
to finish our conversation.

19:02.037 --> 19:05.438
Maybe that was the point.

[Sobbing, Sniffling]

19:10.945 --> 19:15.041
Why Iris?
Why is this happening?

19:22.190 --> 19:26.524
Gracie, we're investigating the leader
of your former church, Enoch O'Connor.

19:26.594 --> 19:30.963
We believe he may have had something
to do with what happened here tonight.

19:33.034 --> 19:36.197
We would appreciate anything
you could tell us about him.

19:36.271 --> 19:38.739
No, he didn't do this.

19:40.075 --> 19:42.305
He didn't do this.

19:42.377 --> 19:44.868
This is Satan's work,
not man's.

19:48.616 --> 19:51.483
Gracie, that sounds like something
Reverend O'Connor might say.

19:51.553 --> 19:54.886
Now, you're not a member
of that congregation anymore.

19:54.956 --> 19:59.484
I understand this, because you're
someone who thinks for herself.

19:59.561 --> 20:03.998
Keeping an open mind, Gracie,
is it conceivable that O'Connor
could've done any of this?

20:04.065 --> 20:07.501
No! Don't you think
I would know?

20:07.569 --> 20:09.730
Me, of all people?

20:09.804 --> 20:12.238
He couldn't have done this.
He just couldn't.

20:16.277 --> 20:21.044
- [Mackey] Gracie might be biased.
- O'Connor is your father.

20:29.324 --> 20:31.417
When Gracie got pregnant...

20:31.493 --> 20:36.726
O'Connor barred her from his church...
she and Jared Chirp.

20:37.866 --> 20:40.300
His church and his home.

20:56.184 --> 21:00.678
- You comin'?
- I think I'll check around back.

21:16.571 --> 21:20.268
"Pray for the souls...
lost to us."

22:32.247 --> 22:34.181
[Rattling]

22:39.988 --> 22:42.889
[Gasping]
Oh!

22:51.565 --> 22:54.261
You must be judged!

23:02.843 --> 23:04.777
Repent!

23:04.845 --> 23:08.281
Pray for the Lord's
quickening power.

23:11.018 --> 23:13.509
To the hands of God.

23:16.657 --> 23:18.887
Let her go!

23:32.006 --> 23:35.339
Your F.B.I. Partner could've
learned something about herself...

23:35.409 --> 23:37.570
if you hadn't
have stopped me.

23:37.645 --> 23:41.206
Some powerful good news, maybe.

23:41.281 --> 23:44.478
I'd say it's good news for you
that she's not here right now,

23:44.551 --> 23:47.816
considering what you
tried to do to her.

23:49.323 --> 23:51.416
Is that what you did
to your wife?

23:54.294 --> 23:56.228
Alice O'Connor.

23:56.296 --> 24:01.495
Succumbed to multiple
snake bites inJune 1994.

24:02.803 --> 24:05.670
It happened during
a church service...

24:05.739 --> 24:08.003
or at least, that's what
you told local police.

24:10.711 --> 24:12.906
You got away with it...

24:12.980 --> 24:14.914
almost.

24:16.950 --> 24:19.441
What was, uh, the problem
with your wife?

24:19.520 --> 24:22.978
Was she not...
righteous enough for you?

24:24.591 --> 24:29.290
Just like your daughter's boyfriend...
or Iris Finster?

24:29.363 --> 24:34.801
Educated man.
Too smart to know any better.

24:34.868 --> 24:37.769
Smart enough to know
you're a murderer.

24:37.838 --> 24:41.865
Satan is near,
and you don't even have eyes.

24:41.942 --> 24:44.137
You're just proud
and fancy free.

24:44.211 --> 24:47.669
Man, no one quite passes
muster with you, huh?

24:47.748 --> 24:52.515
You feel the need to exact
some kind of Old Testament revenge?

24:54.855 --> 24:58.655
What about your daughter?
What were your plans for her?

25:01.228 --> 25:03.321
I pray for her soul.

25:04.398 --> 25:07.492
I pray and I pray,
because she's lost.

25:07.568 --> 25:09.900
Because she no longer
believes as you do?

25:09.970 --> 25:15.408
You think because you're educated,
you're better than most? You ain't.

25:16.877 --> 25:19.846
Unless you're smart
down here...

25:19.913 --> 25:24.680
the devil's gonna make a fool of you,
and you ain't even gonna know it.

25:34.361 --> 25:37.228
I changed my mind.
I don't want to see him.

25:39.600 --> 25:42.967
Besides, I won't do any better than
you people at getting him to talk.

25:47.007 --> 25:49.908
Gracie.

25:49.977 --> 25:52.878
You still don't believe
your father did it?

25:54.148 --> 25:56.241
It don't matter
what I believe.

25:57.618 --> 25:59.779
He'll be judged
as he deserves.

26:00.854 --> 26:02.754
Can't nobody avoid it.

26:51.638 --> 26:53.572
[Snakes Rattling]

26:53.640 --> 26:55.574
[O'Connor Gasping, Muttering]

26:58.245 --> 27:00.179
Help me, Jesus.

27:13.994 --> 27:16.428
[Muttering Continues]

27:51.462 --> 27:53.987
Deputy found him
about an hour ago.

27:54.065 --> 27:57.057
There's no telling
when he was attacked.

27:57.135 --> 28:00.127
I guess it's looking less and less
like he's a suspect.

28:00.204 --> 28:03.002
Unless he somehow managed
to do this to himself...

28:04.976 --> 28:07.035
as a test of
his own righteousness.

28:07.111 --> 28:10.706
Well, if so, Mulder, the jury's
still out. I just spoke to his doctors.

28:10.781 --> 28:14.649
- It's a tossup as to whether
he's gonna pull through this.
- What about antivenin treatment?

28:14.719 --> 28:16.744
- He's not receiving it.
- Why not?

28:16.821 --> 28:19.915
Gracie stepped in. She's trying to
forbid treatment on religious grounds.

28:19.991 --> 28:23.222
It's not clear whether she has a legal
claim to do it, but she says that...

28:23.294 --> 28:25.854
it's up to God as to
whether he lives or dies.

28:25.930 --> 28:29.866
And you're thinking that her actions
may not be entirely motivated...

28:29.934 --> 28:33.028
by concern for her
father's eternal soul?

28:33.104 --> 28:35.538
Well, more to the point,
Mulder, what if she did this?

28:35.606 --> 28:39.906
She told me that her father
would be judged as he deserves.

28:39.977 --> 28:44.539
- You think this is what she meant?
- She grew up around snakes.

28:44.615 --> 28:47.778
Who's to say she isn't every bit
as adept at handling them as he is?

28:47.852 --> 28:51.948
I can see her being angry enough
at her father to attack him,

28:52.023 --> 28:54.753
but what about the others?

29:05.803 --> 29:09.603
He left in a hurry.
Packed one suitcase and a gun.

29:10.675 --> 29:13.269
Earlier that night
he calls Gracie,

29:13.344 --> 29:17.110
gets Iris instead and starts rambling
about paying for his sins.

29:17.181 --> 29:19.775
He's frightened
and wants to leave town,

29:19.850 --> 29:22.375
presumably with Gracie.

29:22.453 --> 29:24.546
So what's he scared of?

29:28.492 --> 29:30.687
I don't understand
how O'Connor's church...

29:30.761 --> 29:33.252
exerts a strong pull
on these people.

29:33.331 --> 29:35.663
- [Rattling]
- It's not so hard to understand.

29:35.733 --> 29:38.668
It's a culture with a very
well-defined set of rules.

29:38.736 --> 29:41.671
- It's an intolerant culture, Mulder.
- I don't know, Scully.

29:41.739 --> 29:44.640
Sometimes a little intolerance
can be a welcome thing.

29:44.709 --> 29:47.678
Clear-cut right and wrong,
black and white, no shades of gray.

29:47.745 --> 29:51.181
In a society where hard and fast rules
are harder and harder to come by,

29:51.249 --> 29:54.116
- I think some people
would appreciate that.
- You're saying that you,

29:54.185 --> 29:57.154
Fox Mulder, would welcome someone
telling you what to believe?

29:57.221 --> 30:00.679
I'm just saying that somebody
offering you all the answers...

30:01.759 --> 30:03.852
can be a very
powerful thing.

30:13.271 --> 30:15.205
Oh, it's lab results.

30:17.608 --> 30:20.338
Am I reading this right? DidJared Chirp
have himself tested for sterility?

30:22.046 --> 30:24.514
Which turns out to be
more or less the case.

30:26.450 --> 30:30.352
Based on this, that means Jared
can't be the father of Gracie's baby.

30:30.421 --> 30:33.288
It's dated the day he died.

30:33.357 --> 30:37.726
So maybe he was killed
because he discovered the truth.

30:40.064 --> 30:42.828
- [Machine Beeping]
- [Door Opens]

30:52.943 --> 30:55.138
Gracie...

30:55.212 --> 30:57.407
I'd like to ask
you to reconsider.

30:57.481 --> 30:59.847
No. This is what he'd want.

30:59.917 --> 31:02.545
He may die without
medical treatment.

31:02.620 --> 31:05.646
I've seen him bit
a dozen times.

31:05.723 --> 31:07.714
He always said that
it was up to God...

31:07.792 --> 31:09.953
whether he lives or dies.

31:10.027 --> 31:12.359
Said it was a worse sin
not to trust God.

31:13.731 --> 31:17.360
There are many ways
to trust God, Gracie.

31:17.435 --> 31:21.496
One of them is to trust in
the miracles of doctors and medicine.

31:22.573 --> 31:26.873
Or in your heart...

31:26.944 --> 31:29.572
do you really not want him
to get better?

31:31.382 --> 31:33.316
It ain't for me.

31:36.887 --> 31:39.255
I can't risk his soul.

31:42.124 --> 31:44.217
When you first came to me,

31:44.293 --> 31:47.456
you said that you wanted
to think for yourself...

31:49.265 --> 31:51.495
to live your life...

31:51.567 --> 31:53.831
as you saw fit.

31:54.970 --> 31:58.997
If you stand here
and let your father die,

31:59.074 --> 32:01.372
whose beliefs
are you living?

32:01.443 --> 32:03.308
Yours...

32:04.513 --> 32:06.310
or his?

32:20.396 --> 32:22.330
You're doing
the right thing.

32:23.332 --> 32:25.596
I'll go tell the doctor, okay?

32:35.678 --> 32:38.146
[Beeping Quickens]

32:50.993 --> 32:53.461
[Gasping]

32:58.000 --> 33:00.491
Agents, Enoch O'Connor is gone.

33:00.569 --> 33:02.833
I was away for five minutes.
His bed's empty.

33:02.905 --> 33:04.964
Gracie is gone too.

33:05.040 --> 33:07.770
How could Gracie have possibly
gotten him out of here?

33:07.843 --> 33:10.141
- Maybe he took her.
- He was on his deathbed.

33:10.212 --> 33:12.680
That's impossible.
And besides, what's his motivation?

33:12.748 --> 33:16.548
I may be able
to answer that.

33:16.618 --> 33:20.679
Jared Chirp wasn't the father
of Gracie's child.

33:20.756 --> 33:22.690
We know that.
What about it?

33:28.430 --> 33:30.364
Enoch O'Connor is.

33:32.067 --> 33:35.468
That's why she wanted to get away
from him and his church...

33:35.537 --> 33:37.971
as fast as she could.

33:38.040 --> 33:40.304
And I tried to teach her
to forgive him.

33:44.513 --> 33:47.346
Uuh! Daddy, please!

33:47.416 --> 33:49.509
[Panicked Gasping]

33:53.956 --> 33:55.981
I'm bringin' you home.

34:01.997 --> 34:04.693
Somebody help me!

34:09.670 --> 34:14.130
In the name of our holy
and most fearsome God.

34:14.208 --> 34:16.871
[All]
Hallelujah!

34:16.945 --> 34:20.277
Resist the devil
and he will flee.

34:20.349 --> 34:23.341
Resist him!

34:23.418 --> 34:26.911
Something's wrong.
Something's wrong with my baby.

34:26.989 --> 34:28.922
Oh!

34:34.163 --> 34:36.097
[Muttering]

34:36.165 --> 34:38.759
DearJesus, put your hands
on this woman. You can heal her.

34:38.833 --> 34:41.359
Oh, yes, God. That's it.

34:41.437 --> 34:44.873
Yes, Jesus. Yes, Jesus.

34:46.641 --> 34:50.077
O Lord. Dear Lord.

34:50.143 --> 34:52.612
DearJesus,
deliver this woman.

34:52.679 --> 34:55.739
Jesus. Jesus.

34:55.817 --> 34:58.877
Yes, Lord. Yes, Jesus.

34:58.953 --> 35:02.480
- No! Don't, don't!
- Dear God.

35:02.557 --> 35:06.152
Dear Heavenly Father,
deliver this woman.

35:06.227 --> 35:08.718
Lay your hands
on this woman.

35:08.796 --> 35:11.822
- God! Yes!
- No!

35:11.900 --> 35:15.996
- Don't! Don't!
- Yes. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.

35:22.410 --> 35:24.605
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

35:24.679 --> 35:27.739
DearJesus. DearJesus.

35:27.815 --> 35:30.943
HolyJesus! Hallelujah!

35:31.019 --> 35:36.013
DearJesus! Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!

35:38.226 --> 35:41.161
Hallelujah! DearJesus!

36:07.956 --> 36:11.653
- How is she?
- Deep shock and some loss of blood.

36:13.861 --> 36:16.329
What happened here?

36:16.397 --> 36:19.127
- Where's the baby?
- These folks aren't talkin'.

36:19.200 --> 36:21.225
[Mulder]
Scully.

36:22.503 --> 36:24.596
Take a look at this.

36:28.776 --> 36:31.301
Snakes.

36:33.715 --> 36:35.979
She gave birth to snakes?

36:38.152 --> 36:40.245
The devil has
been cast out.

36:41.923 --> 36:44.414
Stay with her.

36:44.492 --> 36:47.120
- Where are you going?
- To find her father.

36:47.195 --> 36:49.459
He's gonna wanna tie up
some loose ends.

37:11.619 --> 37:15.055
You stole what was
most precious to me.

37:16.290 --> 37:18.281
Gracie?

37:18.359 --> 37:20.725
She came to me on her own.

37:20.795 --> 37:23.958
- [Mouthing Words]
- She wanted to escape a life of fear...

37:24.032 --> 37:27.229
and judgment,
of intolerance.

37:29.070 --> 37:32.665
- Please, O God... [Muttering]
- She fled a harsh and vengeful God...

37:34.375 --> 37:36.502
and you.

37:44.352 --> 37:46.843
Drop the knife!

37:47.789 --> 37:51.384
[Grunts]
Uuh!

37:59.667 --> 38:02.101
You all right?

38:02.170 --> 38:04.104
[Panting]

38:07.108 --> 38:10.339
- [Siren Wailing]
- Daddy?

38:10.411 --> 38:12.641
- Daddy?
- Gracie, it's Agent Scully.

38:12.713 --> 38:15.147
We're taking you to the doctor
right now, okay?

38:15.216 --> 38:19.084
- No, I gotta...
- Can you tell me what happened, Gracie?

38:20.822 --> 38:23.518
[Quavering]
Ohh!

38:23.591 --> 38:27.391
- Where's my daddy?
- You're safe, Gracie.
My partner's gone after him.

38:29.497 --> 38:31.795
Gracie, you're gonna be okay.
He can't hurt you anymore.

38:31.866 --> 38:36.462
You don't understand.
He saved me.

38:45.313 --> 38:48.077
I'll call for an ambulance.

38:49.283 --> 38:51.478
Relax.
Help's on the way.

38:52.553 --> 38:55.886
No, it's not.
I told you, boy,

38:55.957 --> 38:58.892
you still don't know
which side you're on.

38:59.961 --> 39:03.124
Be smart. Down here.

39:09.170 --> 39:12.105
Yes, please hurry.
They're on their way.

39:18.112 --> 39:21.377
- Agent.
- It wasn't O'Connor.

39:21.449 --> 39:23.917
It was you.
You killed Jared Chirp.

39:23.985 --> 39:28.445
- You're joking.
- No. I'm just beginning to see it now.

39:28.523 --> 39:32.755
Jared must've come to understand that
he wasn't the father of Gracie's baby...

39:32.827 --> 39:34.761
that you were.

39:34.829 --> 39:38.424
Did he confront you earlier that night,
only to see you for who you really are?

39:38.499 --> 39:41.593
Just who is it
you think I am?

39:41.669 --> 39:44.604
Is that what happened
with Iris Finster?

39:44.672 --> 39:47.140
Was she beginning to catch on?
Is that why you killed her?

39:47.208 --> 39:50.871
Or was it just to further frame
Enoch O'Connor?

39:50.945 --> 39:55.473
Is that was this is really about?
Ruining O'Connor? Seducing his daughter?

39:55.550 --> 39:58.917
Destroying him by
any conceivable means?

40:04.188 --> 40:08.887
- Are you a righteous man, Agent Mulder?
- Stay where you are.

40:10.361 --> 40:12.295
It's just a simple question.

40:12.363 --> 40:17.960
Most people believe they're
on the side of angels.

40:18.036 --> 40:20.732
But are they?

40:22.774 --> 40:27.336
If you were put to the test,
how would you do?

40:27.412 --> 40:29.471
- [Rattling]
- Aah... aah!

40:55.974 --> 40:58.499
Where's Mulder?

40:58.576 --> 41:01.943
- Help!
- [Gasping] No!

41:02.013 --> 41:05.540
You can't help him.
This is his alone.

41:10.121 --> 41:11.782
Mulder!

41:18.096 --> 41:20.394
[Grunting]

41:26.037 --> 41:27.698
Aah!

41:35.213 --> 41:37.147
[Rattling]

41:58.536 --> 42:02.768
- Mackey?
- No, still no trace,

42:02.840 --> 42:06.970
even though every law enforcement agency
in Tennessee's out looking for him.

42:07.045 --> 42:09.411
They won't find him.

42:09.480 --> 42:13.211
People think the devil
has horns and a tail.

42:13.284 --> 42:16.481
They're not used to looking for
some kindly man who tells you
what you want to hear.

42:16.554 --> 42:18.579
He's just a man, Mulder...

42:18.656 --> 42:22.854
- just like O'Connor.
- Not like O'Connor.

42:22.927 --> 42:25.760
If this was some kind of test,
looks like I failed.

42:25.830 --> 42:29.425
I'd say if it was,
you passed with flying colors.

42:29.500 --> 42:34.199
- You're alive, aren't you?
- Proud and fancy free.

42:41.312 --> 42:45.476
Reverend Wells, it's a real joy
to have a man in the pulpit...

42:45.550 --> 42:48.713
who has such an open and modern way
of looking at God.

42:48.786 --> 42:51.118
Bless you for saying so.

42:51.189 --> 42:54.488
Well, I won't keep you.
I just wanted to welcome you to Hamden.

42:54.559 --> 42:57.892
Thank you.
I look forward to seeing you on Sunday.

42:57.962 --> 42:59.896
Thank you.

43:19.784 --> 43:21.718
[Squeaking]

43:32.196 --> 43:34.130
[Hisses]

44:27.384 --> 44:30.080
[Child]
I made this!
