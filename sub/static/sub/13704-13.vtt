00:51.684 --> 00:53.019
The contestant to be eliminated...

01:01.094 --> 01:02.395
The contestant to be eliminated is...

01:05.298 --> 01:06.299
JB.

01:13.673 --> 01:15.742
As for JB's teammate, Hae-seong...

01:16.543 --> 01:18.144
Hae-seong will be eliminated too.

01:18.845 --> 01:20.246
But she worked so hard.

01:21.214 --> 01:22.882
She worked harder than anyone.

01:29.122 --> 01:31.391
She was on the B team,

01:31.925 --> 01:34.794
which came in first place
in the first round of the audition.

01:36.696 --> 01:40.700
While she was on the lowest-scoring team
in this round,

01:41.067 --> 01:42.802
the bonus points she earned
in the first round...

01:47.974 --> 01:49.109
have saved her from elimination.

01:50.710 --> 01:53.980
You're getting a second chance.
Please step it up, Shin Hae-seong.

01:57.150 --> 01:58.251
How uncanny.

01:59.385 --> 02:01.020
Everything fits together uncannily.

02:01.287 --> 02:02.755
What do you mean?

02:03.289 --> 02:05.325
I don't know if it was intended,

02:05.758 --> 02:08.495
but as much as Rian has won
the sympathy of the audience,

02:09.062 --> 02:11.798
JB and Hae-seong
have aroused their hatred.

02:14.033 --> 02:17.303
But only JB was eliminated,
and Hae-seong survived.

02:18.037 --> 02:22.275
Which means that Hae-seong
could be the target of criticism.

02:23.443 --> 02:25.545
And the winner of this round

02:27.113 --> 02:29.449
is the pair Jin Yu-jin and Rian.

03:04.751 --> 03:06.452
No need to act in front of me.

03:07.921 --> 03:08.855
What do you mean?

03:08.922 --> 03:11.090
I didn't think you would cry.

03:11.491 --> 03:12.859
You're really something else.

03:13.960 --> 03:14.794
Rian.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.530
You're not as terrible an actress as
people say you are.

03:18.631 --> 03:19.933
Do you think that was part of acting?

03:20.733 --> 03:21.668
Wasn't it?

03:22.202 --> 03:23.770
Why the long face?

03:24.771 --> 03:26.839
Shouldn't you be happy? You beat JB.

03:27.273 --> 03:30.610
Did you know someone
was going to be eliminated?

03:34.280 --> 03:36.649
You knew, didn't you?

03:36.716 --> 03:37.584
No.

03:38.751 --> 03:40.420
Regardless, we didn't get eliminated.

03:40.954 --> 03:42.388
Isn't that all that matters?

03:42.789 --> 03:45.158
I wanted to win,
but I didn't want to push anyone down.

03:46.259 --> 03:47.360
Don't worry.

03:49.095 --> 03:50.029
JB...

03:51.231 --> 03:52.932
won't crumble that easily.

03:54.534 --> 03:55.602
I told you.

03:56.102 --> 03:57.904
The audition is rigged.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.774
There's a good reason
why he was eliminated

04:03.309 --> 04:04.677
despite pulling off a good performance.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.180
What is that reason?

04:11.150 --> 04:13.286
Here comes your answer.

04:17.790 --> 04:18.992
Excuse me, Mr. Shin.

04:21.494 --> 04:23.796
Eliminate me instead of JB.

04:24.063 --> 04:25.398
JB got the fewest votes.

04:25.465 --> 04:28.635
I'm not the one who eliminated him.

04:28.701 --> 04:30.903
Based on talent, I should be eliminated.

04:30.970 --> 04:34.574
Do you think JB was eliminated
solely based on talent?

04:36.576 --> 04:40.246
But if it wasn't talent, then...

04:40.513 --> 04:44.217
JB, your partner, knew your
skill level better than anyone.

04:44.951 --> 04:47.920
If he was set on winning,
he would have picked a different partner.

04:49.589 --> 04:52.392
The moment he chose to pair up with you,

04:53.693 --> 04:56.529
he gave up on winning this mission.

04:57.964 --> 04:58.798
Pardon?

04:58.865 --> 05:01.301
JB wasn't eliminated. He was disqualified.

05:02.168 --> 05:06.606
He cared more about going on stage
with you than winning.

05:07.607 --> 05:11.110
He insulted not only the other contestants
who did their best to win

05:11.177 --> 05:12.378
but also the audience.

05:23.656 --> 05:24.691
Hey!

05:28.861 --> 05:29.729
What do you think?

05:30.296 --> 05:32.632
Aren't I doing well for someone
who's just been eliminated?

05:36.602 --> 05:37.570
What's the matter?

05:37.937 --> 05:39.038
I'm fine.

05:40.273 --> 05:43.609
I've failed many auditions,
including the Kirin's admissions audition.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.679
But here I am, a Kirin student.

05:47.513 --> 05:48.448
And I got to meet you.

05:51.718 --> 05:52.685
Because of me...

05:56.422 --> 05:57.457
It's because of me...

06:00.126 --> 06:03.463
Didn't I tell you
that you don't look pretty when you cry?

06:05.231 --> 06:06.432
So don't cry.

06:07.066 --> 06:07.900
Stop.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.235
Hey, wake up.

06:43.803 --> 06:45.638
You stink.

06:47.106 --> 06:47.940
Hey!

06:49.242 --> 06:50.710
What do you think you're doing?

06:51.244 --> 06:53.513
How can you barge into
a guys' room like this?

06:53.780 --> 06:55.748
Isn't that unladylike?

06:56.048 --> 06:58.284
Do you know what time it is?
Why are you still in bed?

06:58.551 --> 06:59.619
Get up.

06:59.685 --> 07:00.520
Why?

07:00.887 --> 07:01.988
More practice?

07:03.489 --> 07:04.490
Let's just take one day off.

07:04.991 --> 07:06.993
Breakfast is ready. Come and eat.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.061
What? Breakfast?

07:09.429 --> 07:11.397
-Breakfast.
-You made breakfast for me?

07:11.464 --> 07:13.266
-Of course.
-Are you looking out for me?

07:14.033 --> 07:15.234
Wait.

07:15.568 --> 07:18.204
It looks like you're not wearing
much makeup.

07:18.471 --> 07:20.273
No panda eyes today.

07:21.073 --> 07:22.375
You listened to me.

07:23.676 --> 07:24.844
You like me, don't you?

07:26.612 --> 07:27.980
Why would I like you?

07:28.314 --> 07:30.416
Why would I ever like you?

07:30.483 --> 07:32.318
Just come and eat breakfast.

07:32.718 --> 07:33.553
Hurry.

07:56.776 --> 08:01.414
You're just like any other high school kid
first thing in the morning.

08:02.448 --> 08:04.283
Your complexion
isn't so flawless after all.

08:04.917 --> 08:07.487
-You must use great makeup.
-Wait.

08:10.256 --> 08:12.325
What do you want?

08:12.592 --> 08:15.261
-Rian made breakfast.
-Breakfast?

08:15.328 --> 08:17.363
She must be treating everyone
to celebrate yesterday's win.

08:18.130 --> 08:20.500
You were good yesterday.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.201
I'll give you that.

08:23.436 --> 08:25.605
Aren't you too composed
for someone who was eliminated?

08:27.073 --> 08:30.042
I learned something more important
than winning.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.279
Performing isn't about winning.

08:34.113 --> 08:35.648
It's about enjoying it.

08:39.218 --> 08:41.554
You're only saying that
because you're embarrassed, right?

08:43.256 --> 08:44.357
Don't act so cool.

08:45.124 --> 08:46.626
Brush your teeth. You have morning breath.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.565
No, I don't.

08:53.232 --> 08:55.535
-This looks amazing.
-Home-cooked meal! What a treat.

09:01.140 --> 09:02.608
-There are ribs!
-And fritters.

09:02.775 --> 09:03.709
Here you go.

09:04.410 --> 09:05.578
Who would have thought

09:05.645 --> 09:07.380
that you would ever lift a finger
in the kitchen?

09:07.813 --> 09:09.849
I've always been good
at helping with housework.

09:11.217 --> 09:14.887
She may be a bit of a diva,
but she must be diligent at home.

09:16.122 --> 09:18.190
Thank you, ma'am.

09:18.257 --> 09:20.626
You're very welcome. Enjoy.

09:20.826 --> 09:22.862
Rian told me so much about all of you.

09:22.929 --> 09:25.298
She said she made great friends.

09:25.498 --> 09:27.266
You were kind enough
to throw her a birthday party.

09:28.067 --> 09:29.402
Yes.

09:29.869 --> 09:34.073
We're best friends. Right?

09:37.643 --> 09:39.145
Don't act like a neat freak.

09:41.681 --> 09:44.283
Do you have a contagious disease?
Why do you carry around a spoon?

09:44.884 --> 09:46.986
So I can mooch off whoever, whenever.

09:47.386 --> 09:49.589
Suit yourself. Be a mooch.

09:50.323 --> 09:51.424
Be the biggest mooch out there.

09:58.331 --> 09:59.398
Eat your fill. This is good.

10:01.834 --> 10:02.668
Oh, no.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.404
I forgot to bring chopsticks.

10:05.871 --> 10:07.473
-Should I go buy some?
-Yes.

10:08.140 --> 10:09.208
What a good girl.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.277
Hey.

10:11.644 --> 10:13.980
I'm starting to see Rian in a new light.
Aren't you?

10:14.780 --> 10:16.782
She's so good to her mom.
She seems like a sweetheart.

10:51.083 --> 10:52.652
Stay away from JB.

10:52.718 --> 10:54.620
He was eliminated because of you.

10:54.687 --> 10:56.422
You should take responsibility
for what happened!

11:02.028 --> 11:04.163
Hey, what should we do with her?

11:04.730 --> 11:05.831
What will you do with her?

11:20.413 --> 11:21.247
Answer me.

11:22.548 --> 11:23.382
Come on.

11:23.983 --> 11:26.385
I want to see what you have in store.

11:28.254 --> 11:29.722
I can't stand her, either.

11:31.290 --> 11:33.826
So, go on. Go ahead.

11:36.495 --> 11:38.664
And of all places,
you had to do this out in the open.

11:42.234 --> 11:44.670
It seems you haven't decided on
what you're going to do with her.

11:45.905 --> 11:49.542
Why don't you run along
and come back once you've come up with...

11:51.343 --> 11:52.178
a concrete plan?

11:53.045 --> 11:53.946
Got that?

11:57.283 --> 11:58.284
Rian.

11:58.584 --> 12:01.153
We're only doing this for JB.

12:04.857 --> 12:06.525
I know. I really do.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.131
Here.

12:12.631 --> 12:13.799
Cheese.

12:19.772 --> 12:21.907
I have photographic evidence now.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.710
If you don't want to see me
at the police station,

12:25.811 --> 12:26.712
beat it.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.547
One, two...

12:35.721 --> 12:36.589
Thanks.

12:44.196 --> 12:46.132
You said you would make sure
JB wouldn't get hurt.

12:47.733 --> 12:51.771
How do you expect to protect JB
when you can't fend for yourself?

12:53.706 --> 12:56.108
If you're not confident, give up.

12:58.778 --> 12:59.745
Wait.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.354
There's something
that I don't know, isn't there?

13:09.755 --> 13:11.290
Why can't you be honest with me?

13:13.159 --> 13:15.027
Do you want me to be honest

13:17.463 --> 13:19.598
about why we came to this school,

13:21.400 --> 13:23.936
why the Super Idol Audition was planned,

13:25.671 --> 13:27.173
and why HershE was disbanded?

13:27.807 --> 13:28.641
Why?

13:29.375 --> 13:30.509
Why did all that happen?

13:30.943 --> 13:32.378
It was all for JB.

13:34.113 --> 13:38.250
It was an elaborate project
to make JB into a superstar.

13:40.252 --> 13:42.655
They picked Jin Yu-jin
as the first super idol

13:43.823 --> 13:46.592
so that he could serve as JB's pacemaker.

13:48.427 --> 13:49.628
Isn't it something?

13:53.165 --> 13:54.333
A pacemaker?

13:55.167 --> 13:58.170
What gives you the right to use me?

13:59.905 --> 14:00.840
Aren't you going to ask

14:02.274 --> 14:04.577
why Jin Yu-jin acted like that?

14:08.180 --> 14:10.115
But someone threw a wrench in the plan.

14:12.284 --> 14:14.420
And that's you, Shin Hae-seong.

14:16.255 --> 14:17.489
So, JB knew.

14:19.191 --> 14:20.693
Yu-jin knew as well.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.763
Everyone knew but me.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.600
What if JB ends up blaming you?

14:28.734 --> 14:31.503
What if he blames you
for having kept him from rising higher?

14:32.805 --> 14:35.007
What if he blames you
for losing everything?

14:36.742 --> 14:37.843
He won't.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.578
What will your excuse be?

14:40.813 --> 14:42.882
Are you saying these things
because you're worried about JB?

14:43.515 --> 14:44.850
I'm worried about you.

14:47.253 --> 14:48.087
But why...

14:49.321 --> 14:52.291
What do you care?

14:53.859 --> 14:55.027
Because I owe you.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.032
Thanks to you,

15:01.400 --> 15:03.502
I'm learning how good I can be
and how far I can rise

15:04.503 --> 15:05.571
all on my own.

15:21.153 --> 15:24.256
This is Park Hong-ju's video submitted
for the second round of the audition.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.660
This video was the inspiration

15:28.494 --> 15:30.329
for the theme of this mission.

15:34.199 --> 15:37.937
The title of this mission
is "A Song for One Person."

15:38.871 --> 15:40.673
If your song moves a single person,

15:40.973 --> 15:43.342
it can move everyone out there.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.545
Be honest and sincere
in expressing your story.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.515
What moves people is never far away.

15:55.287 --> 15:59.124
Won't indirect experience help them
express themselves more effectively?

15:59.425 --> 16:02.027
Would acting be helpful?

16:08.934 --> 16:11.704
I was an English literature major.

16:12.538 --> 16:18.911
I may be of help in teaching the kids
how to write lyrics...

16:19.278 --> 16:20.379
They're both good ideas.

16:21.280 --> 16:24.583
Mr. Yang, please prepare
a special lecture on writing song lyrics.

16:25.284 --> 16:29.421
Acting is a form of expression,
so we can film the students acting.

16:29.888 --> 16:31.390
It will be reflected
in their final scores.

16:32.891 --> 16:36.362
Please see to that, Ms. Ahn.

16:40.733 --> 16:42.301
I almost forgot.

16:44.937 --> 16:48.907
This will be the final round
of the Super Idol Audition.

16:52.478 --> 16:54.413
This is your last chance.

17:02.621 --> 17:05.891
He always throws in the key part
like a passing remark.

17:07.226 --> 17:09.028
Why is it suddenly the final round?

17:11.363 --> 17:14.333
Does this mean JB is eliminated for good?

17:24.143 --> 17:27.012
You have to sit out on the special classes
related to the audition.

17:29.014 --> 17:30.783
The outcome was unfortunate,

17:31.250 --> 17:33.419
but I personally enjoyed
your performance with Hae-seong.

17:35.320 --> 17:36.388
Don't worry about me.

17:38.690 --> 17:40.392
Just think of this as a temporary setback.

17:41.894 --> 17:45.297
If you fall, all you have to do
is pick yourself back up.

17:47.366 --> 17:48.300
I have faith in you.

18:31.677 --> 18:33.712
She shouldn't overexert herself.

18:34.079 --> 18:35.214
I know.

18:36.849 --> 18:39.051
Why did he have to say
it was the final round?

18:40.119 --> 18:41.487
Shouldn't we tell her to take it easy?

18:41.787 --> 18:43.021
She doesn't listen to me.

18:44.423 --> 18:46.391
Hey, have you tried talking to her?

18:46.792 --> 18:50.562
No. Like anything I say
would make a difference.

18:51.063 --> 18:52.464
You haven't even tried.

18:55.767 --> 18:56.735
What are you doing here?

18:58.370 --> 18:59.438
How's your throat?

19:00.606 --> 19:03.442
I've been seeing a doctor
JB introduced me to.

19:03.509 --> 19:04.610
My throat's a lot better.

19:05.110 --> 19:05.944
JB did?

19:07.279 --> 19:08.347
He's quite something.

19:09.848 --> 19:11.583
I haven't seen him around lately.

19:12.351 --> 19:13.852
Not just during the day.

19:13.919 --> 19:15.988
He's nowhere to be seen at night either.

19:16.755 --> 19:17.990
He's fallen off the radar.

19:19.424 --> 19:21.994
As for you,
you shouldn't overexert yourself.

19:22.528 --> 19:24.696
Don't worry. I can take care of myself.

19:24.963 --> 19:26.398
Take care of yourself?

19:26.865 --> 19:28.634
There's only so much you can do.

19:28.834 --> 19:29.668
That's right.

19:29.735 --> 19:32.504
You should take it easy
and never skip doctor's appointments--

19:32.571 --> 19:35.073
You guys are two peas in a pod.

19:35.140 --> 19:35.974
What?

19:45.250 --> 19:46.084
What?

19:46.451 --> 19:47.553
It's me.

19:52.457 --> 19:53.559
How about a free throw faceoff?

19:54.059 --> 19:56.595
I'm not in the mood.

19:58.764 --> 20:00.465
What's with you? You seem so listless.

20:00.966 --> 20:03.602
I'm so bored without you.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.370
You need to get a grip.

20:09.107 --> 20:09.942
Move.

20:10.776 --> 20:11.977
Gosh.

20:22.888 --> 20:25.691
Why are you following me around
like a puppy that's lost his master?

20:26.291 --> 20:28.026
I haven't lost my master.

20:28.527 --> 20:29.361
I'm...

20:30.295 --> 20:31.430
your pacemaker.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.599
That's why I'm following you around.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.168
Fine.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.670
Fine, let's go ahead and be done with it.

20:39.104 --> 20:41.139
If I win,

20:41.840 --> 20:44.209
you'll reenter the audition

20:44.276 --> 20:46.878
so that you can kneel before me
on stage to admit your defeat.

20:48.113 --> 20:49.314
Wager something else.

20:49.815 --> 20:51.049
I was eliminated from the audition.

20:53.552 --> 20:57.189
-If you insist, Shin--
-No way.

20:58.624 --> 21:00.058
Not Hae-seong.

21:00.125 --> 21:01.927
Who said it I was going to mention her?

21:02.694 --> 21:04.963
I meant shoes.

21:05.030 --> 21:06.765
We're wagering our shoes. I like yours.

21:18.844 --> 21:20.012
I'm sorry.

21:50.275 --> 21:52.277
What kind of lyrics

21:52.978 --> 21:54.112
move people?

21:55.747 --> 21:57.983
They can't be mundane, right?

21:59.217 --> 22:03.322
They need to be novel and artistic.

22:04.256 --> 22:05.090
Okay.

22:05.624 --> 22:08.994
"I'll wait for you forever."

22:09.528 --> 22:11.229
That's very mundane.

22:11.563 --> 22:16.435
How can you convey the same feeling
in a more artistic manner?

22:19.338 --> 22:24.443
DECEMBER 32ND

22:29.514 --> 22:33.285
"January has come,
but since you are not here..."

22:41.927 --> 22:44.096
What do you think?

22:44.496 --> 22:50.802
Metaphysical lyrics
that result from the coming together

22:50.869 --> 22:54.072
of the mind's message
and artistic creativity.

22:55.073 --> 22:56.141
Mr. Yang.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.109
Yes?

22:57.175 --> 22:58.477
It's too difficult.

22:58.710 --> 23:00.245
How can we come up with things like that?

23:01.646 --> 23:02.647
I suppose...

23:03.315 --> 23:05.083
Not anyone can do that.

23:07.119 --> 23:07.953
All right.

23:08.587 --> 23:13.458
There's something else you can do
if you lack artistic creativity.

23:13.792 --> 23:17.295
Even if you aren't novel or creative,
there's a way you can move people.

23:17.362 --> 23:18.196
How?

23:19.398 --> 23:21.700
By using your sincerity.

23:21.767 --> 23:22.601
Sincerity...

23:23.068 --> 23:27.539
No song is greater or more moving

23:27.606 --> 23:29.975
than one that is sincere.

23:30.409 --> 23:34.246
How about we take this time
for honest and open dialogue?

23:35.180 --> 23:37.048
Get into groups of three.

23:37.382 --> 23:38.216
Come here.

23:38.717 --> 23:40.452
Hae-seong, you sit here.

23:41.353 --> 23:43.855
Get into a circle and face each other.

23:46.558 --> 23:49.194
Sit in those positions.

23:50.028 --> 23:52.664
You can share happy memories

23:53.265 --> 23:55.467
or your deepest secrets.

23:55.967 --> 23:59.304
Just be open and sincere.

24:09.347 --> 24:10.782
-Rian.
-Yes?

24:10.849 --> 24:12.851
Isn't there anything
you can share with them?

24:13.718 --> 24:16.054
I don't have much to say.

24:16.121 --> 24:17.789
How about when you were a trainee?

24:17.856 --> 24:19.591
Everyone here wants to be a singer.

24:19.891 --> 24:21.526
Share some wise words
as an experienced singer.

24:22.227 --> 24:24.896
Yes, since you're experienced.

24:26.364 --> 24:27.466
Shall I?

24:29.835 --> 24:32.704
Every day, I went to the agency
to practice singing and dancing.

24:33.705 --> 24:36.107
As a formality, I went to school,
mostly to get some shut-eye.

24:36.641 --> 24:39.077
Then it was back to the agency
for more singing and dancing.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.113
When you started lagging behind,

24:43.181 --> 24:44.749
the agency would kick you out
just like that.

24:46.351 --> 24:50.388
So I kept practicing out of fear.
Over and over.

24:51.256 --> 24:52.991
You were so dogged.

24:53.625 --> 24:54.960
I wasn't like that at all.

24:56.628 --> 24:59.531
How did you manage to endure it?

25:02.033 --> 25:03.335
Because we were together.

25:04.836 --> 25:06.505
No matter how tough things got,

25:09.007 --> 25:11.009
I was not alone.

25:17.282 --> 25:19.317
Even when things got extremely difficult,

25:21.386 --> 25:22.454
even when I was hurting...

25:31.263 --> 25:33.031
A single glance or word of encouragement

25:34.666 --> 25:35.800
from him...

25:47.345 --> 25:49.247
It made everything disappear.

26:16.575 --> 26:17.475
JB.

26:20.178 --> 26:21.446
What are you doing here?

26:21.947 --> 26:23.114
I'm waiting for Hae-seong.

26:26.785 --> 26:28.119
I don't like this one bit.

26:28.753 --> 26:29.588
Why not?

26:30.622 --> 26:35.226
When you first came to our school,
you stood out because you were so unique.

26:37.095 --> 26:39.531
But you're so plain now.

26:39.998 --> 26:41.633
Way too plain.

26:43.301 --> 26:46.705
Hey, I look more like a celebrity
than you.

27:09.361 --> 27:10.729
Coffee and a waffle, please.

27:16.568 --> 27:18.136
That can't be her.

27:18.436 --> 27:20.505
She's way too plain.

27:21.406 --> 27:22.841
She's the epitome of plain.

27:22.907 --> 27:23.808
It is her.

27:24.142 --> 27:26.344
The picture in the paper
must've been photoshopped.

27:27.045 --> 27:29.080
I wonder how that girl
managed to seduce JB.

27:29.581 --> 27:32.450
She could be a nine-tailed demon fox
in disguise.

27:39.524 --> 27:40.825
Do you want to see my tail?

27:41.459 --> 27:43.762
Do you want to check
and see if I'm a real fox?

27:55.607 --> 27:57.842
Being JB's girlfriend
is no walk in the park.

27:59.077 --> 28:00.779
It takes a lot of strength
and self-restraint.

28:04.382 --> 28:05.383
Are you reading poetry?

28:06.451 --> 28:09.154
I want to write my own song
for the upcoming mission,

28:09.988 --> 28:13.925
but I was drawing a blank,
so I was reading it for inspiration.

28:16.361 --> 28:17.629
Have you found your inspiration yet?

28:24.769 --> 28:27.038
"Walking along a trail
by the field we used to stroll,

28:27.305 --> 28:29.441
gazing at the sunset
settling over the field,

28:30.108 --> 28:32.377
wounded flower petals wave their hands.

28:32.711 --> 28:35.513
It is the wounded flower petals
that are the most fragrant."

28:39.684 --> 28:40.585
What do you think?

28:41.319 --> 28:42.287
Cool, right?

28:45.223 --> 28:46.157
It's too complicated.

28:47.358 --> 28:48.426
Really?

28:48.493 --> 28:50.361
It hasn't been long
since I came back to school.

28:51.062 --> 28:52.397
Do something simple.

28:53.131 --> 28:54.632
Write about the person closest to you.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.203
The person closest to me?

29:02.207 --> 29:03.908
The mission is to sing a song
for one person.

29:04.442 --> 29:06.311
Don't you think
you should write a song for me?

29:08.113 --> 29:10.849
Of course, I should.

29:14.285 --> 29:16.821
You have to win this round

29:18.790 --> 29:20.425
to make my elimination
count for something.

29:26.364 --> 29:27.198
Are you done?

29:31.736 --> 29:33.138
"When I first saw you,

29:33.204 --> 29:35.173
the time bomb in my heart
started its countdown."

29:35.240 --> 29:36.374
"Countdown."

29:37.809 --> 29:39.511
"The countdown of destiny.

29:39.778 --> 29:43.548
You will fall for me before it goes off."

29:43.615 --> 29:44.449
"Fall for me."

29:45.150 --> 29:46.151
You call these lyrics?

29:47.318 --> 29:48.820
Hey!

29:50.054 --> 29:50.889
You're so...

29:52.657 --> 29:56.261
"This has never happened before.
I can't forget the electrifying jolt.

29:56.594 --> 29:59.764
You pull me in. You put a spell on me."

30:03.902 --> 30:05.670
Aren't you going to beat me up?

30:06.304 --> 30:07.272
Can I...

30:08.706 --> 30:09.974
have this song?

30:11.476 --> 30:12.477
Yes, sure.

30:16.381 --> 30:18.917
I have a woman

30:19.217 --> 30:22.053
I can't do this

30:22.120 --> 30:26.491
Every time I see you, I waver

30:26.558 --> 30:27.392
Hey.

30:27.826 --> 30:28.960
That's no good.

30:29.460 --> 30:30.295
Listen.

30:31.329 --> 30:33.198
It's infuriating

30:33.264 --> 30:35.333
Why do you keep toying with me?

30:35.400 --> 30:39.003
I think I'll go crazy

30:40.338 --> 30:41.372
That's no good either.

30:45.376 --> 30:46.211
How about this?

30:47.278 --> 30:48.479
Who are you dedicating it to?

30:49.514 --> 30:50.348
My dad.

30:50.415 --> 30:51.249
Your dad?

30:54.052 --> 30:56.521
Stifling and suffocating, dirty cash

30:56.588 --> 30:58.156
Not a penny to my name

30:58.223 --> 31:00.258
I'm happy as can be

31:00.325 --> 31:01.793
It is a crazy thing to say?

31:01.860 --> 31:04.229
Destroying my dream, dirty cash

31:04.295 --> 31:07.866
This world where money
Is the measure of happiness

31:07.932 --> 31:09.601
How much for my dream?

31:11.402 --> 31:14.339
It doesn't sound like
a good song for a dad.

31:14.739 --> 31:15.707
It's okay.

31:15.773 --> 31:17.976
Money means everything to him.

31:48.406 --> 31:50.241
SEUL'S MOTHER

31:55.380 --> 31:57.615
Singing is very much like acting,

31:57.682 --> 31:59.817
only that it's expressed
through music and lyrics.

32:00.184 --> 32:03.121
The acting class today

32:03.187 --> 32:04.889
will help you deliver the words
to your songs

32:04.956 --> 32:06.691
more effectively and emotively.

32:07.058 --> 32:12.730
Memorize the lines I gave you
and act out the scenes with a partner.

32:13.097 --> 32:14.132
Okay.

32:18.803 --> 32:20.371
I'm leaving today,

32:21.339 --> 32:23.908
but if you can give me one more chance,

32:24.509 --> 32:25.543
I'll stay.

32:27.578 --> 32:28.780
I'm sorry, but...

32:29.981 --> 32:31.749
you and I live in two different worlds.

32:33.718 --> 32:35.586
You're incredibly famous,

32:37.021 --> 32:38.790
and I'm so ordinary.

32:40.325 --> 32:43.094
You are too good for me.

32:44.295 --> 32:46.230
Fame is nothing.

32:47.532 --> 32:48.533
Right now,

32:48.733 --> 32:50.969
I'm just a woman who's standing
in front of the man she loves.

33:07.118 --> 33:09.754
You said that even if life pushes us off
the edge of a cliff,

33:11.055 --> 33:14.826
what lies beneath will not be the end.

33:18.029 --> 33:19.964
I want to love you again.

33:21.532 --> 33:23.801
It's not because I love you.

33:24.235 --> 33:26.037
It's because I can't help but love you.

33:26.738 --> 33:28.339
I love you.

33:36.381 --> 33:39.350
I'm not saying I want to be your husband
because I love you.

33:39.417 --> 33:40.518
Then what is it?

33:41.519 --> 33:44.255
Some kind of noblesse oblige?

33:44.322 --> 33:46.891
See? You really are dumb.

33:47.825 --> 33:49.827
It's not because I love you.

33:50.194 --> 33:53.664
It's because I love no one but you,
you amazing woman.

33:57.902 --> 33:59.570
Is that the best acting you can pull off?

34:00.471 --> 34:01.472
Are you sure?

34:02.607 --> 34:04.008
Just quit acting.

34:05.576 --> 34:08.546
This uniform is not what you think it is.

34:10.481 --> 34:11.749
Don't lie to me.

34:15.486 --> 34:17.255
That's not the face of a happy person.

34:18.656 --> 34:19.490
Yes.

34:21.959 --> 34:23.861
This is what I look like when I'm happy.

34:26.330 --> 34:29.734
Stop lying to me, you awful girl.

34:35.139 --> 34:37.108
You really drive me nuts.

34:42.580 --> 34:43.414
Yes.

34:44.582 --> 34:46.717
I love him.

34:49.887 --> 34:50.988
I love the president...

34:51.055 --> 34:51.956
I mean,

34:52.590 --> 34:55.760
I love Jin-heon very much,

34:57.261 --> 34:58.996
so don't get in the way.

35:00.865 --> 35:03.901
I know your situation,

35:04.435 --> 35:06.604
but it was all in the past.

35:06.671 --> 35:08.206
That's not true.

35:08.272 --> 35:10.775
It was three years ago.

35:11.175 --> 35:13.244
It never was over.

35:13.578 --> 35:15.513
That's what you think,

35:15.746 --> 35:17.548
but Jin-heon doesn't have feelings
for you anymore.

35:17.615 --> 35:19.150
He used to be my man.

35:19.217 --> 35:22.086
He's my man now.

35:24.589 --> 35:26.390
We never broke up.

35:27.658 --> 35:31.596
But he's dating me right now.

35:31.662 --> 35:33.931
You've been together for only 100 days.

35:35.466 --> 35:37.235
He and I lasted eight years.

35:38.269 --> 35:40.505
You're probably too young to know,

35:41.372 --> 35:44.008
but memories are just memories.

35:44.408 --> 35:46.210
Memories have no power.

35:54.185 --> 35:56.087
They're good.

36:04.495 --> 36:07.265
Who said Rian was a bad actress?
She's amazing.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.767
But she was not acting.

36:22.413 --> 36:24.248
Your acting was superb.

36:25.683 --> 36:27.385
If you had pursued acting
instead of singing,

36:27.785 --> 36:30.221
you could have had much more potential.

36:31.622 --> 36:33.991
You were good too.

36:34.692 --> 36:36.727
No one can call you
a terrible actress anymore.

36:40.998 --> 36:43.000
"Memories have no power."

36:45.102 --> 36:46.737
Do you really think so?

36:48.906 --> 36:50.141
Memories...

36:51.042 --> 36:52.543
are just memories.

36:54.378 --> 36:58.216
There's no future
if you stay caught up in the past.

37:01.118 --> 37:02.653
We'll see...

37:04.222 --> 37:05.356
if you're right.

37:25.376 --> 37:27.878
Why don't you ask your boyfriend
to help you?

37:28.813 --> 37:30.681
I'm fine. I can carry them all.

37:30.748 --> 37:31.682
You can put it back.

37:32.316 --> 37:34.652
Why so many boxes? Is it all food?

37:41.559 --> 37:43.027
STAY AWAY FROM JB

37:54.705 --> 37:56.774
Just look at that.

37:57.608 --> 37:59.510
I should throw that out.

38:03.781 --> 38:04.949
This isn't the first time, is it?

38:06.117 --> 38:07.752
You've gotten packages
like this before, right?

38:10.121 --> 38:10.988
What is this?

38:11.622 --> 38:13.824
What did you do
to deserve something like this?

38:24.869 --> 38:27.505
-Let go.
-What do you like about him?

38:28.673 --> 38:31.175
Is it because he's a celebrity?
Because he's a star?

38:32.076 --> 38:34.045
Just how much do you like him
that you'd go through this?

38:35.713 --> 38:37.348
Feelings for another person

38:38.449 --> 38:39.950
aren't something you can control.

38:41.519 --> 38:42.486
Don't you know that?

38:43.254 --> 38:44.088
Yes.

38:44.555 --> 38:45.556
I do know.

38:46.290 --> 38:47.358
I know all too well.

38:49.794 --> 38:50.828
That's why...

38:52.897 --> 38:55.933
I won't hide my feelings for you anymore.

39:00.471 --> 39:02.707
I'm sorry for liking you.

39:08.679 --> 39:09.513
Yu-jin.

39:09.847 --> 39:11.282
I'll become a better person.

39:12.783 --> 39:15.653
I'll become more famous than JB.

39:17.621 --> 39:19.657
That's not what this is about.

39:20.858 --> 39:21.859
It doesn't matter.

39:24.395 --> 39:25.396
In any case,

39:25.996 --> 39:27.298
I did say I was sorry.

39:45.416 --> 39:47.385
I stamped my seal.

39:57.728 --> 40:00.297
You called us liars and frauds.

40:01.399 --> 40:02.767
I take that back.

40:03.534 --> 40:04.702
Please make me into a star.

40:06.504 --> 40:08.839
Are you telling us you want
to become a professional singer?

40:09.673 --> 40:12.510
Will you make TV appearances,
do commercials, and release albums?

40:13.110 --> 40:16.180
I'll do whatever it takes
to become greater than JB.

40:18.315 --> 40:19.817
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

40:20.684 --> 40:21.519
I...

40:22.853 --> 40:24.188
I have to become better than JB.

40:24.455 --> 40:25.456
That's what I want.

40:27.858 --> 40:30.194
That's certainly good news.

40:33.998 --> 40:35.433
I look forward to your help and guidance.

40:41.505 --> 40:42.606
It's fascinating.

40:43.674 --> 40:45.242
He has a different look in his eyes.

40:47.044 --> 40:48.779
I don't know why,
but I want to root for him.

40:52.950 --> 40:56.053
FIRST PARTY: OZ ENTERTAINMENT
SECOND PARTY: JIN YU-JIN

40:58.556 --> 40:59.423
Yes?

41:00.925 --> 41:02.059
Hey.

41:02.493 --> 41:04.562
Who said you can barge in like that?

41:05.329 --> 41:07.698
Listen, I'm a popular
hotshot of a counselor.

41:07.765 --> 41:09.099
You need an appointment.

41:09.533 --> 41:11.368
I haven't seen anyone come here
all day long.

41:12.436 --> 41:14.305
Why were you spying on me?

41:14.772 --> 41:16.073
-What is it?
-Mr. Ju.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.007
What?

41:17.708 --> 41:18.809
I did something terrible.

41:22.513 --> 41:23.914
What now?

41:24.682 --> 41:26.417
What is it?

41:27.785 --> 41:30.087
What did you do?

41:30.521 --> 41:31.922
It wasn't that terrible.

41:31.989 --> 41:34.091
Then what is it? Did you beat someone up?

41:34.758 --> 41:35.993
The contract...

41:37.161 --> 41:39.163
I signed with Oz.

41:40.397 --> 41:43.000
Good grief. Why did you have to scare me?

41:43.834 --> 41:44.735
So you signed?

41:46.036 --> 41:48.005
I guess it could be considered terrible
in some respects.

41:48.873 --> 41:51.509
But what now?
You'll just have to work really hard.

41:51.575 --> 41:52.476
What's the big deal?

41:53.744 --> 41:54.712
Right.

41:55.713 --> 41:56.580
But...

41:57.414 --> 42:00.050
have you ever felt like you've lost
even though you've won?

42:01.318 --> 42:02.152
What?

42:03.120 --> 42:06.056
It's like I am in pain
after seeing someone else in pain.

42:08.125 --> 42:11.328
I'm a novice counselor.
Speak in plainer terms.

42:15.132 --> 42:17.034
At first, I just wanted to win.

42:17.101 --> 42:17.968
Yes.

42:18.435 --> 42:20.371
But seeing Hae-seong next to him...

42:22.273 --> 42:24.608
Seeing how hard it's been for her
because of him...

42:25.342 --> 42:26.343
Shin Hae-seong?

42:27.745 --> 42:30.614
Maybe it was all about her
from the beginning.

42:32.583 --> 42:34.251
My determination to beat JB,

42:35.586 --> 42:37.154
and my desire to become a star...

42:37.621 --> 42:38.556
So?

42:39.323 --> 42:41.191
Does that make you feel
uncomfortable and embarrassed?

42:44.628 --> 42:46.063
No need to be embarrassed.

42:46.830 --> 42:47.665
Hey.

42:48.465 --> 42:49.667
I was just like you.

42:51.769 --> 42:53.003
I picked up music

42:53.904 --> 42:56.674
to impress the woman who's now my wife.

42:58.943 --> 43:00.110
It's okay.

43:02.513 --> 43:03.747
RISING COMMERCIAL STAR, JIN YU-JIN

43:04.582 --> 43:06.317
YU-JIN, A THREAT TO THE COMMERCIAL KING,
SAM-DONG!

43:07.351 --> 43:09.620
NEW CELEBRITY WONDER,
SUPER IDOL RISING UP TO COMMERCIAL HEIGHTS

43:10.487 --> 43:11.322
Perfect.

43:12.690 --> 43:14.692
JIN YU-JIN, THE BLUE CHIP
OF NEXT-GENERATION COMMERCIALS

43:15.726 --> 43:17.261
THE MOST SOUGHT-AFTER STAR FOR COMMERCIALS

43:19.063 --> 43:24.568
HOW FAR WILL JIN YU-JIN'S
TRANSFORMATION GO?

43:27.938 --> 43:29.640
What if JB ends up blaming you?

43:32.009 --> 43:34.745
What if he blames you
for having kept him from rising higher?

43:35.946 --> 43:38.148
What if he blames you
for losing everything?

43:39.750 --> 43:40.951
He won't.

43:41.251 --> 43:42.820
What will your excuse be?

44:22.493 --> 44:25.763
THE FIRST STUDY ABROAD ADVISING

44:30.401 --> 44:31.468
What's all this?

44:32.036 --> 44:34.538
School brochures
your mom sent over from Australia.

44:35.372 --> 44:37.808
I'll take your opinion into consideration
this time.

44:38.242 --> 44:39.777
Take your time
and look them over carefully.

44:42.513 --> 44:44.415
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

44:45.482 --> 44:48.419
When I asked you to let me go,
you said to stay here for a year.

44:50.754 --> 44:52.022
I'm sorry, Seul.

44:53.524 --> 44:54.358
For what?

44:56.260 --> 44:58.162
You're not going to tell me
as usual, are you?

44:59.363 --> 45:01.131
When you divorced Mom

45:01.465 --> 45:03.333
and then sent me to her,

45:06.737 --> 45:08.706
you didn't explain anything to me then.

45:11.041 --> 45:12.810
Seul, I was...

45:14.378 --> 45:15.479
REPORTER PARK

45:18.682 --> 45:20.017
It's always like this.

45:32.663 --> 45:33.597
Hello?

45:34.465 --> 45:35.466
What's up?

45:39.636 --> 45:40.471
What?

45:43.140 --> 45:46.009
Are you sure it's Rian's mother?

45:47.144 --> 45:48.746
No one is spared.

45:48.812 --> 45:51.915
We'll dig up the past that our guests
may want to keep buried.

45:51.982 --> 45:53.083
Welcome.

45:53.484 --> 45:55.886
Oh, no, everyone will know
about your plastic surgery.

45:57.054 --> 45:58.322
Let's take a look.

45:59.123 --> 46:00.524
One, two, three.

46:00.858 --> 46:02.659
Ta-da.

46:06.363 --> 46:07.631
It's New Clear Man.

46:07.965 --> 46:09.600
I loved that show when I was a kid.

46:10.300 --> 46:15.139
There are rumors that it was you
who played New Clear Man.

46:15.572 --> 46:17.274
Come on.

46:18.509 --> 46:20.644
-People change as they age,
-Right.

46:20.711 --> 46:22.212
but this kid has an extra-large head.

46:22.279 --> 46:24.114
My head is definitely small.

46:24.181 --> 46:25.516
The size is different.

46:26.617 --> 46:29.486
If you were New Clear Man, you would've
been a more experienced actor than me.

46:29.553 --> 46:30.387
Really?

46:30.454 --> 46:34.191
The rumor started because the child actor
who played New Clear Man

46:34.258 --> 46:38.595
suddenly disappeared from showbiz.

46:38.962 --> 46:42.499
Yu-jin, why don't you tell us
about your parents then?

46:42.566 --> 46:45.035
We know very little
about your family background.

46:45.102 --> 46:47.271
I'm sure viewers are curious.

47:02.953 --> 47:04.121
My parents

47:05.389 --> 47:06.456
are dead.

47:06.957 --> 47:09.226
I'm sorry to hear that.

47:10.127 --> 47:12.362
It's probably hard to talk about it.

47:12.429 --> 47:13.864
I apologize.

47:13.931 --> 47:15.098
It's okay.

47:23.507 --> 47:27.744
A group who made thousands
by selling fake designer goods online

47:27.811 --> 47:29.313
has been arrested.

47:29.813 --> 47:31.181
According to the police,

47:31.248 --> 47:35.919
Kim and the group advertised the site
as being run by the famous singer, Rian,

47:35.986 --> 47:41.024
and made some 500 million won
by selling fake designer label goods.

47:41.859 --> 47:44.294
It has been reported

47:44.361 --> 47:47.798
that one member of the ring
is actually Rian's mother.

47:48.232 --> 47:49.266
Oh, no.

47:49.566 --> 47:51.635
Rian is still filming that TV show
with Yu-jin.

47:52.469 --> 47:53.303
Where?

47:53.604 --> 47:54.504
In the dressing room.

48:00.811 --> 48:02.112
That wraps up the shoot.

48:02.179 --> 48:03.747
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

48:03.814 --> 48:05.215
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

48:05.282 --> 48:06.884
-Let's go.
-Thank you.

48:07.150 --> 48:08.051
Good job today.

48:11.688 --> 48:15.025
When did your parents pass away?

48:20.664 --> 48:22.232
You must not want to talk about it.

48:22.866 --> 48:23.834
I'm sorry.

48:26.270 --> 48:27.671
You said your mother

48:29.539 --> 48:31.508
is quite the nagger, right?

48:33.477 --> 48:34.912
You remembered.

48:36.413 --> 48:38.782
When I became a trainee
and lived in the dorm,

48:39.616 --> 48:41.551
I got into fights with her
every time I went home.

48:42.586 --> 48:46.023
We would be mean
and refuse to talk to each other.

48:47.257 --> 48:48.258
You don't hate her?

48:48.792 --> 48:50.027
I do.

48:51.695 --> 48:53.063
But still, she's my mom.

48:57.834 --> 48:59.036
Over there.

49:01.605 --> 49:02.906
-Excuse me.
-Out of the way.

49:04.708 --> 49:05.609
Rian.

49:05.676 --> 49:09.012
Is it true that you were directly involved
in running the fake online shop?

49:10.213 --> 49:12.950
Do you know about your mother's arrest?

49:13.150 --> 49:16.420
Word is going around
that you'll soon announce your retirement

49:16.486 --> 49:17.921
to take responsibility for what happened.

49:18.689 --> 49:19.856
I will let you know

49:21.091 --> 49:22.826
after I look into the matter.

49:22.893 --> 49:25.896
You are admitting
to your involvement, right?

49:25.963 --> 49:27.197
Just a brief comment, Rian.

49:27.264 --> 49:28.432
Stop it.

49:29.666 --> 49:31.702
Please stop. This is a school.

49:32.602 --> 49:33.670
Let's get you out of here.

49:34.137 --> 49:35.772
-Wait.
-Rian!

49:36.340 --> 49:38.342
-We would like your comment, Rian.
-Excuse me!

49:38.408 --> 49:39.743
Are you pleading guilty to the charge?

49:48.018 --> 49:50.620
Let's stay here until things quiet down.

49:52.656 --> 49:54.124
Why are you helping me?

49:56.059 --> 49:57.394
We're not close enough

49:58.295 --> 49:59.930
for you to want to help me.

50:01.264 --> 50:03.066
I'm repaying my debt.

50:04.034 --> 50:06.970
I don't like owing anything.

50:08.372 --> 50:09.706
We have one thing in common.

50:15.612 --> 50:16.980
I thought about what you said

50:19.082 --> 50:21.018
about memories having no power.

50:26.056 --> 50:27.224
I think you're right.

50:32.462 --> 50:33.597
Can I...

50:36.500 --> 50:39.069
ask you a question?

50:42.472 --> 50:44.508
Why did you and JB break up?

50:48.111 --> 50:49.413
We didn't.

50:51.581 --> 50:53.350
He dumped me.

50:54.017 --> 50:54.851
What?

50:58.255 --> 51:00.490
It was the day
that JB's father passed away.

51:03.093 --> 51:04.828
I wanted to comfort him,

51:06.997 --> 51:08.231
but he said he wanted to break up

51:12.536 --> 51:16.306
so that he could be the best
like he had promised his father.

51:19.042 --> 51:21.678
Because of his debut show,
his dad passed away without him there.

51:23.814 --> 51:26.650
JB really wanted to keep
his promise to his dad.

51:29.019 --> 51:30.587
I couldn't refuse

51:34.357 --> 51:37.394
because I knew how important
his dream was to him.

51:40.263 --> 51:41.631
I wanted to protect his dream.

51:45.669 --> 51:47.170
From that day onward,

51:48.271 --> 51:49.773
JB didn't look back and pushed ahead,

51:51.842 --> 51:53.143
not taking a moment's rest.

51:58.415 --> 52:02.219
But you came along, and JB stopped short.

52:05.655 --> 52:06.523
So...

52:07.824 --> 52:12.028
Was JB the friend who you said
gave you strength and comfort

52:13.697 --> 52:14.631
during your traineeship?

52:22.239 --> 52:23.240
A star

52:25.108 --> 52:26.877
only looks nice from far off.

52:29.079 --> 52:30.247
Up close,

52:31.281 --> 52:32.382
it's not all that.

52:34.985 --> 52:35.919
I mean, look at me.

52:36.887 --> 52:39.856
Look at me struggle so hard
just to survive.

52:41.791 --> 52:45.595
And here I am now,
playing hide-and-seek with reporters.

53:03.547 --> 53:05.348
TO MY MOTHER...

53:14.090 --> 53:16.726
MOM...

53:39.716 --> 53:40.784
My dream is...

53:56.299 --> 54:00.403
to help JB realize his dream.

54:26.363 --> 54:27.631
Pick up the phone.

54:33.169 --> 54:34.137
Pick...

54:49.686 --> 54:52.689
SHIN HAE-SEONG

54:53.790 --> 54:54.624
Hello?

54:57.694 --> 54:58.962
It's been a few days.

54:59.763 --> 55:03.166
He always comes in late,
so I assumed he was with you.

57:01.084 --> 57:02.352
Because we were together.

57:06.723 --> 57:08.258
No matter how tough things got,

57:09.159 --> 57:11.127
I was not alone.

57:11.494 --> 57:13.596
WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER

57:15.165 --> 57:18.735
A single glance
or word of encouragement from him...

57:20.437 --> 57:22.272
It made everything disappear.

57:45.929 --> 57:46.830
You...

57:49.199 --> 57:50.066
and me

57:52.502 --> 57:53.436
together.

58:15.792 --> 58:18.228
DAY TO DAY...

58:46.089 --> 58:49.425
EVERYTHING BECOMES OKAY.
THE PAINFUL MEMORIES DISAPPEAR.

59:24.694 --> 59:25.795
Let's play hooky.

59:26.362 --> 59:28.665
See you at KBC Hall at two o'clock.

59:31.734 --> 59:34.604
You look so pretty, Hae-seong.

59:36.339 --> 59:37.373
Where are you going?

59:37.740 --> 59:39.943
Do you have to ask?

59:40.209 --> 59:41.210
You have a date, don't you?

59:43.112 --> 59:43.947
I do.

59:44.480 --> 59:45.982
So jealous.

59:56.793 --> 1:00:00.029
I think my hair's okay.

1:00:02.532 --> 1:00:03.600
I have to look plain.

1:00:05.268 --> 1:00:06.436
Maybe this is flashy.

1:00:11.874 --> 1:00:13.276
Dress like an ordinary student.

1:00:27.056 --> 1:00:29.926
Why did you want to see me here?

1:00:31.394 --> 1:00:35.031
It was here that I saw
the I:dn concert last year.

1:00:37.100 --> 1:00:38.201
You were here?

1:00:39.002 --> 1:00:39.902
Yes.

1:00:41.104 --> 1:00:44.907
I still vividly remember
what you looked like on stage.

1:00:46.609 --> 1:00:50.580
Then, I imagined standing next to you.

1:00:53.583 --> 1:00:57.920
Would you like to come to my next concert
as a guest and sing with me?

1:01:07.163 --> 1:01:08.097
It's a present.

1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:12.101
Did you write this?

1:01:22.578 --> 1:01:23.680
You and me together?

1:01:24.347 --> 1:01:25.181
Yes.

1:01:26.983 --> 1:01:31.120
I want to hear this song
at the next concert.

1:01:33.990 --> 1:01:35.191
It's a duet.

1:01:35.992 --> 1:01:37.660
We can sing it together up there.

1:01:41.197 --> 1:01:42.098
No.

1:01:45.068 --> 1:01:46.703
I'll just watch from here.

1:01:49.272 --> 1:01:50.540
This is where I belong,

1:01:52.675 --> 1:01:56.345
and that stage is where you belong.

1:01:59.849 --> 1:02:00.717
Even though

1:02:02.318 --> 1:02:03.953
you turn 30,

1:02:05.188 --> 1:02:06.656
or 40,

1:02:08.224 --> 1:02:11.394
and even though you end up having
a beer belly and your hair recedes,

1:02:13.062 --> 1:02:15.398
I'll always be your fan.

1:02:33.783 --> 1:02:35.251
Seeing the Jang U-jae

1:02:36.352 --> 1:02:38.054
who is just an ordinary
high school student

1:02:39.522 --> 1:02:40.890
made me realize something.

1:02:43.693 --> 1:02:45.128
What I like...

1:02:46.529 --> 1:02:49.832
is the JB who shines on stage.

1:02:52.268 --> 1:02:54.470
Seeing your sparkle disappear

1:02:55.805 --> 1:02:56.939
has been too hard.

1:03:02.578 --> 1:03:03.412
Hae-seong.

1:03:04.313 --> 1:03:05.248
Don't be like this.

1:03:07.750 --> 1:03:08.584
Let's...

1:03:13.956 --> 1:03:16.893
Let's call it quits now.

1:03:22.765 --> 1:03:23.900
I'll go on stage again.

1:03:26.435 --> 1:03:28.471
I'll become the JB you remember me as.

1:03:37.013 --> 1:03:37.847
It's...

1:03:39.248 --> 1:03:42.652
too hard for me to be your girlfriend.

1:03:45.788 --> 1:03:46.622
A star...

1:03:48.624 --> 1:03:50.259
only looks nice from far off.

1:03:52.228 --> 1:03:53.429
Up close,

1:03:54.564 --> 1:03:55.464
it's not all that.

1:04:30.333 --> 1:04:31.367
We'll get on the bus.

1:04:31.434 --> 1:04:33.236
-Sparrows go
-Chirp, chirp

1:04:33.302 --> 1:04:35.304
-Duckies go
-Quack, quack

1:05:36.732 --> 1:05:40.169
FOR JB &amp; RIAN
