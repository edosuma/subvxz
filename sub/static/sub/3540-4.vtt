<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font> For over a century,
I have lived in secret. Until now.

00:07.172 --> 00:09.868
I know the risk,
but I have to know her.

00:10.042 --> 00:11.566
<font color="#808080">ELENA :</font> I'm Elena.
<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font> I'm Stefan.

00:11.583 --> 00:13.734
<font color="#808080">DAMON :</font> I'm Damon.
<font color="#808080">ELENA :</font> You didn't tell me you had a brother.

00:13.946 --> 00:16.471
- It's complicated.
<font color="#808080">DAMON :</font> Elena. Dead ringer for Katherine.

00:16.682 --> 00:19.378
- Which one of you dated her first?
<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font> Katherine is dead.

00:19.551 --> 00:21.951
And you hate me
because you loved her.

00:22.121 --> 00:24.646
- I was hoping I'd see you again.
<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font> She's not a puppet.

00:24.823 --> 00:28.054
She doesn't exist for you to feed on
whenever you want to.

00:28.260 --> 00:32.594
- They're whatever I want them to be.
- Wear it for me for good luck.

00:33.565 --> 00:35.294
<font color="#808080">DAMON :</font>
You wanna kiss me.

00:36.268 --> 00:37.565
Vervain in the necklace.

00:37.770 --> 00:40.568
It's been a while since anyone
could resist my compulsion.

00:40.739 --> 00:42.468
<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font>
There's nothing human left in Damon.

00:42.708 --> 00:45.336
No good, no kindness. No love.

00:45.577 --> 00:49.308
Only a monster who must be stopped.

01:31.890 --> 01:34.825

of another deadly animal attack.

01:35.260 --> 01:39.856
The wild animal terrorizing citizens
has claimed another victim...

01:40.032 --> 01:43.001
...local high school student,
Elena Gilbert.

01:43.168 --> 01:47.400
Police are certain that evidence will
confirm that this is the same animal...

02:21.507 --> 02:24.340
Do you know how easy it was
to get into your head just now?

02:24.510 --> 02:28.412
You really need some human blood.
It might even the playing field.

02:28.680 --> 02:30.614
Football reference.

02:31.083 --> 02:32.948
Too soon?

02:41.927 --> 02:44.054
All right, I deserve that.

02:44.630 --> 02:47.724
But I just wanted to let you know,
they caught the culprit.

02:47.933 --> 02:51.096
The animal responsible for killing
Tanner and all those people.

02:51.270 --> 02:54.569
- What are you talking about?
- A mountain lion. Really big one.

02:54.740 --> 02:57.868
It attacked a hunter this morning.
It's all over the news.

02:58.043 --> 03:00.876
"Deadly beast captured.
All's well in Mystic Falls."

03:01.080 --> 03:03.605
Why would you cover your tracks?

03:05.784 --> 03:07.251
I've decided to stay a while.

03:08.587 --> 03:10.714
And I'm having fun here
with you and Elena.

03:10.889 --> 03:14.723
- Can't touch her now.
- The vervain keeps me out of her head.

03:14.893 --> 03:16.656
Maybe that's not my target.

03:16.895 --> 03:20.126
Believe it or not, Stefan,
some girls don't need my persuasion.

03:20.365 --> 03:23.766
Some girls just can't resist
my good looks...

03:23.936 --> 03:26.404
...my style and my charm...

03:26.572 --> 03:30.064
...and my unflinching ability

04:07.179 --> 04:12.310
I can confirm that a puma attacked
a hunter and was subsequently killed.

The hunter is in stable condition.

But how do I stop a monster
without becoming one myself?

04:25.130 --> 04:28.122
To repeat, the animal terrorizing
Mystic Falls has been caught.

04:33.572 --> 04:35.062
Him.

04:35.307 --> 04:36.740
Including tomorrow night's...

04:36.942 --> 04:39.672
<font color="#808080">ELENA :</font> The news guy?
- Also known as Logan "Scum" Fell.

04:39.878 --> 04:42.642
Did your mom tell you
why I moved away from Mystic Falls?

04:42.848 --> 04:44.975
Oh, no way.

04:45.150 --> 04:46.208
You and him?

04:46.451 --> 04:47.543
Logan Fell...

04:47.753 --> 04:49.050
He's cute.

04:49.254 --> 04:52.712
He is not cute.
There's nothing cute about him.

04:55.661 --> 04:59.654
- What are you doing with that?
- I got it from the safe deposit box.

04:59.865 --> 05:01.890
Mom told Mrs. Lockwood
she would loan it...

05:02.067 --> 05:05.468
...to the Founder's Council
for their heritage display.

05:05.971 --> 05:07.700
Is that Grandma Beth's wedding ring?

05:07.906 --> 05:10.773
Originally, it was Great-Great-Grandma
Mary's wedding ring.

05:10.976 --> 05:13.877
How much do you think this stuff
is worth, like, on eBay?

05:14.046 --> 05:15.274
You're not gonna find out.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.948
That stuff is Mom and Dad's.
You can't give it away.

05:18.116 --> 05:20.676
I'm not giving it away.
It's called a loan, Jeremy.

Are you okay?

06:05.764 --> 06:07.425
I'm good.

06:07.733 --> 06:10.930
- Sorry.
- Maybe we should press pause.

06:11.970 --> 06:15.303
Yeah, you're probably right.
That was getting a bit...

06:15.540 --> 06:17.565
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:22.247 --> 06:25.045
How do you look in a suit?

06:26.485 --> 06:29.113
- I can pull one off.
- How about tomorrow night?

06:29.288 --> 06:31.449
Will you be my date
to the Founder's Party?

06:31.657 --> 06:33.818
- They still do that?
- Have you been before?

06:35.193 --> 06:39.129
No, the Salvatores
don't get invited anymore.

06:40.065 --> 06:42.363
Well, this year,
there's this heritage project...

06:42.567 --> 06:44.194
...that meant a lot to my mom.

06:44.369 --> 06:46.837
She was really involved
in the Founder's Council...

06:47.005 --> 06:50.805
...and it was her favorite party.
I know it sounds really boring but...

06:50.976 --> 06:54.343
I would be honored to accompany you,
Miss Gilbert.

06:55.380 --> 06:58.315
The pleasure is all mine, Mr. Salvatore.

07:03.689 --> 07:06.123
No yellow. Jaundice. Go for the blue.

07:06.325 --> 07:08.316
- I don't like the blue.
- Well, I do.

07:09.127 --> 07:11.891
- And if I'm gonna be your date...
- You cannot be my date.

07:12.097 --> 07:15.362
My mother is going to be there
and she's a very proud gun owner.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.694
I went through a lot to make sure
this party wasn't canceled.

07:18.870 --> 07:21.202
It's very important I be there.

07:21.540 --> 07:22.700
Please take me.

07:27.746 --> 07:30.146
You should come
to the Founder's Party with me.

07:30.315 --> 07:32.112
Not if you're wearing that dress.

07:34.886 --> 07:37.855
What's so special about this Bella girl?
Edward's so whipped.

07:38.056 --> 07:41.685
You gotta read the first book first.
It won't make sense if you don't.

07:42.427 --> 07:46.329
- I miss Anne Rice. She was so on it.
- How come you don't sparkle?

07:46.498 --> 07:49.194
I live in the real world
where vampires burn in the sun.

07:49.401 --> 07:50.993
Yeah, but you go in the sun.

07:51.169 --> 07:54.229
I have a ring. Protects me. Long story.

07:56.174 --> 07:58.506
Will these bites
turn me into a vampire?

08:00.145 --> 08:02.170
It's more complicated than that.

08:02.347 --> 08:05.339
You have to feed on my blood,
then die, then feed on a human.

08:05.517 --> 08:08.714

- Go with Elena.
- She's asking Stefan.

09:27.165 --> 09:29.861
- Okay, go by yourself.
- Gee, thanks.

09:30.035 --> 09:32.765
What about your mom?
Is she okay with you bringing Damon?

09:32.938 --> 09:34.838
And I'm supposed to care why?

He's Older, Sexy, Danger Guy.

09:37.042 --> 09:40.534
Older, Sexy, Danger Guy?
Is that an official witch Twitter tweet?

09:40.745 --> 09:42.144
No more witch jokes, okay?

09:42.314 --> 09:44.612
That Mr. Tanner prediction thing
has me freaked.

09:44.816 --> 09:46.681
Okay.

09:48.119 --> 09:49.609
And Damon's not dangerous.

09:49.788 --> 09:53.622
You know, he just has a lot of issues
with his brother.

09:53.792 --> 09:56.158
You know, like major,
deep-rooted drama.

09:56.328 --> 09:57.386
Like?

09:59.064 --> 10:00.964
I'm not really supposed
to say anything.

kept a secret in your life?

10:04.836 --> 10:08.328
Okay. But you can't tell Elena.

No.

10:10.041 --> 10:12.032
So, what you gonna buy me?

10:22.654 --> 10:25.521
Really? Then who are you taking
to the Founder's Party?

10:26.091 --> 10:28.150

10:28.326 --> 10:30.817
...do you want me to ask you
to the Founder's Party?

10:30.996 --> 10:33.328

True.

10:35.066 --> 10:38.160

You realize you had to ask him
to ask you, right?

10:46.545 --> 10:49.036
You figure if you dress
like a respectable lady...

10:49.247 --> 10:51.238
...he'll finally treat you like one?

10:52.083 --> 10:54.517
Screw you, Jeremy.

10:55.053 --> 10:58.511
You know you're making wrong choice,
yet you make it anyway.

11:00.058 --> 11:01.525
It's sad.

11:12.938 --> 11:15.873
- Didn't know you were here.
- Going through Stefan's homework.

11:16.041 --> 11:19.101
Boy, this country has dumbed down
in the last hundred years.

11:19.344 --> 11:21.574
Why he wants to go to high school
is beyond me.

11:21.746 --> 11:24.738
In the '70s, he went lvy League.
Harvard, I understood.

11:24.916 --> 11:26.781
Actually, no. I didn't get that either.

11:28.153 --> 11:30.087
Go ahead, purge.

11:30.288 --> 11:31.949
Get it out. What's on your mind?

11:34.559 --> 11:36.049
Why are you here, Damon?

11:38.396 --> 11:40.296
To spend time with you, Zach.

11:41.299 --> 11:42.891
Family's important.

11:43.735 --> 11:47.000
I know you.
You always have a motive.

11:47.238 --> 11:49.263
So tell me, what is it this time?

11:50.742 --> 11:52.733
You are in no position to question me.

11:54.145 --> 11:55.612
I didn't mean to upset you.

11:56.781 --> 11:58.749
This is not upset, Zach.

- No, I'm not and neither are you.

12:14.165 --> 12:16.133
How many have to die
before you see that?

12:16.301 --> 12:19.202
- I see it, all right.
- Then why aren't you doing anything?

12:19.437 --> 12:21.632
I can't, Zach.

12:21.806 --> 12:22.830
I can't.

12:23.008 --> 12:24.270
It would take human blood.

12:24.442 --> 12:27.900
It's the only way that I could stop him
and I can't do that.

12:30.815 --> 12:35.343
Vervain could weaken him
if he ingested it.

12:35.553 --> 12:37.521
It would help get you the upper hand.

12:37.689 --> 12:40.385
Vervain hasn't grown here since 1865.

12:40.558 --> 12:42.458
Damon saw to that.

12:42.627 --> 12:44.356

<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font>
You've been growing it.

13:14.059 --> 13:17.517
It's just something that's been
passed down through the generations.

Blood only runs so deep
when you're related to vampires.

13:22.500 --> 13:25.333

13:25.970 --> 13:28.063
But you're telling me.

13:28.406 --> 13:29.964
Why?

14:00.205 --> 14:01.695
Not now, okay, guys? Please?

14:01.906 --> 14:04.374
- I'm fine. He's being a punk.
- I got your punk.

14:04.542 --> 14:08.069
Look, Tyler, maybe you should go.
Tell your mom that I'll see her tonight.

14:10.381 --> 14:14.147
Hey, would it make a difference
if I told you I actually like Vicki?

14:14.385 --> 14:16.615
Not even if you meant it.

14:16.821 --> 14:19.221
Delicate Flower versus Naughty Vixen.

14:19.424 --> 14:21.324
Tough call. Can we mix them?

14:21.526 --> 14:23.892
Look at you,
getting all pretty for your date.

14:24.062 --> 14:25.393
You seem happyish.

14:25.563 --> 14:27.588
I am-ish.

14:27.766 --> 14:29.597
Tonight's gonna be a good night.

14:29.801 --> 14:34.829
Don't let that stop you from telling me
whatever it is you wanted to tell me.

14:35.073 --> 14:38.736
What if I tell you in the morning?
I don't want to ruin the night.

14:38.910 --> 14:40.571
Bonnie, out with it.

14:40.745 --> 14:44.078
Okay, but it has to go in the vault
because Caroline will kill me...

14:44.249 --> 14:46.774
...if it gets back to Damon
that she squealed.

14:47.418 --> 14:49.943
Apparently, Stefan has
a very interesting back story.

14:50.755 --> 14:51.813
Uh-huh.

14:51.990 --> 14:53.958
Do you know what happened
with Katherine?

14:54.159 --> 14:57.287
I know that they both dated her
and that's why they have issues.

14:57.462 --> 15:00.693
Yeah, they both dated her,
only she chose Damon.

15:00.932 --> 15:02.160
And that drove Stefan mad.

15:02.333 --> 15:04.995
So he did horrible things to try
and break them up.

15:05.170 --> 15:06.501
He manipulated Katherine.

15:06.704 --> 15:09.605
He filled her head with all these lies
until it worked...

15:09.774 --> 15:11.298
...and she turned against Damon.

15:11.509 --> 15:14.569
Sounds like one person's side
of the story, meaning Damon's.

15:14.779 --> 15:16.770
I just wanted you to know.

15:16.948 --> 15:19.610
Anyway, his past relationships
are none of my business.

15:19.818 --> 15:22.548
Unless he's a calculating,
manipulative liar.

15:22.720 --> 15:23.778
That's your business.

15:23.955 --> 15:26.890
- Stefan is none of those things.
- Yeah? How do you know?

15:35.633 --> 15:37.863
They still wear ties at this thing?

15:38.102 --> 15:41.367
- Why are you even going?
- It's fitting. We were at the first one.

15:41.539 --> 15:44.030
It's better if we don't draw attention
to ourselves.

15:44.209 --> 15:45.801
So you should stay here.

15:45.977 --> 15:48.502
I'll see to it Elena has a good time.

15:50.148 --> 15:52.878
My goodness, I've driven you to drink.

15:53.685 --> 15:55.312
Can't seem to rid myself of you.

15:55.520 --> 15:58.512
What else am I supposed to do,
besides go about living my life?

15:58.690 --> 16:01.921
"Go about living my life."
See, therein lies your eternal struggle.

16:04.128 --> 16:06.255

Let me check. Mm-hm.

16:33.358 --> 16:34.757
I will find it and bring it.

Okay. Bye.

Ahh! God, what now?

The pocket watch. Where is it?

16:46.571 --> 16:47.697
What watch?

16:47.872 --> 16:49.806
The one you stole from Mom's box.

16:50.041 --> 16:53.408
Look, Mrs. Lockwood just called me
freaking out.

16:53.578 --> 16:56.911
It was on the list, Jeremy.
She can't find it and thinks she lost it.

16:57.115 --> 16:59.049
And maybe she did.
Maybe Tyler took it.

16:59.217 --> 17:01.082
Don't even play that card. You took it.

17:01.252 --> 17:04.779
Am I gonna find it on eBay?
Is that how you pay for your pot?

17:04.989 --> 17:06.819
Screw you.

17:15.599 --> 17:18.467
- I would never sell this, okay?
- Then why did you take it?

17:18.636 --> 17:20.262
Because it's supposed to be mine.

17:20.438 --> 17:25.102
Dad said it goes to the firstborn son.
His father gave it to him and now what?

17:28.246 --> 17:31.306
- And he was gonna give it to you.
- Yeah.

17:35.820 --> 17:39.256
Look, Jeremy, it's still yours, okay?

17:39.857 --> 17:42.792
Mom promised Mrs. Lockwood.
What do you want me to do?

has been the height of my happiness.

18:00.511 --> 18:02.001
You cracked a funny, Stefan.

18:04.048 --> 18:06.141
I should have a drink and celebrate.

18:13.358 --> 18:17.124
1864. You and Katherine
were the perfect couple.

18:17.295 --> 18:19.263
It was hell watching you
dance with her.

18:19.464 --> 18:21.955
My happiness was short-lived,
as you well know.

18:22.166 --> 18:24.031
I remember.

18:24.268 --> 18:26.395
I left the party early,
I was waiting for her.

18:26.637 --> 18:29.128
That night you dropped her off,
I was waiting inside.

18:29.307 --> 18:32.470
You were such a gentleman,
gave her a kiss on the cheek.

18:32.677 --> 18:34.838
When what she really wanted was...

18:37.015 --> 18:39.916
Oh, well. Here's to history
repeating itself, huh?

18:45.990 --> 18:47.514
I admire your effort, Stefan.

18:47.692 --> 18:50.684
Pouring yourself a drink
then spiking the bottle with vervain.

I'm not some drunk sorority chick.
You can't roofie me.

18:55.900 --> 18:59.563
But I can't help but feel a little used.
I thought we were having a moment.

And it all started
with the original Salvatore brothers.

25:02.299 --> 25:06.861

didn't he?

25:07.571 --> 25:09.801

The Salvatore name was practically
royalty in this town until the war.

25:28.993 --> 25:31.791
- There was a battle here...
- The Battle of Willow Creek.

25:32.430 --> 25:35.797
- Right.
- I know, we talked about it in class.

25:35.966 --> 25:38.901
Confederate soldiers fired on a church
with civilians inside.

25:39.069 --> 25:41.560
What the history books left out...

25:41.739 --> 25:45.266
...was the people that were killed,
they weren't there by accident.

25:45.443 --> 25:47.502
They were believed
to be union sympathizers.

25:47.711 --> 25:50.578
So some of the founders
on the confederacy side back then...

25:50.748 --> 25:53.273
...wanted them rounded up
and burned alive.

25:54.151 --> 25:57.848
Stefan and Damon had someone
they loved very much in that church.

25:59.590 --> 26:02.787
And when they went to rescue them,
they were shot.

26:02.960 --> 26:05.326
Murdered in cold blood.

26:05.529 --> 26:07.929
Who was in the church
that they wanted to save?

26:08.132 --> 26:09.531
A woman, I guess.

26:11.836 --> 26:15.033
Doesn't it always come down
to the love of a woman?

26:19.043 --> 26:21.944
I'm sorry that you and Stefan
have this thing between you...

26:22.112 --> 26:24.842
...but I can't get
in the middle of it, Damon.

26:25.816 --> 26:27.181
I just...

26:27.885 --> 26:30.353
I hope you two can work it out.

26:30.754 --> 26:32.381
I hope so too.

26:38.395 --> 26:40.454

26:40.631 --> 26:43.259

26:45.669 --> 26:48.900
Maybe you could show me around.
I mean, this place is amazing.

26:49.073 --> 26:52.201
Yeah, if you like living in a museum.

26:55.279 --> 26:59.579
Maybe I should just strip naked
and give Pastor Bill a lap dance.

26:59.817 --> 27:02.581
That's why we're hiding
in a corner all night, isn't it?

27:02.820 --> 27:05.983
You're scared of how I'm gonna act,
afraid of what your parents...

27:06.156 --> 27:07.987
...are gonna think about your date?

27:08.158 --> 27:09.921
I don't care about what they think.

27:10.160 --> 27:12.890
Great. Let's go say hi.

27:13.063 --> 27:14.087
Knock it off, Vick.

27:14.298 --> 27:16.596
Or we could just
sneak up to your bedroom.

27:16.800 --> 27:18.529
As long as nobody sees us, right?

27:19.036 --> 27:21.402
- Vicki, I swear...
- What's the matter, Ty?

27:21.572 --> 27:24.063
You scared to stand up to your mommy?
It's pathetic.

27:25.242 --> 27:27.176
- Look, let go.
- Tyler.

27:28.679 --> 27:30.738
We didn't get a chance
to say hello earlier.

27:30.915 --> 27:33.349
It's Vicki, right? Matt's sister.

27:33.551 --> 27:34.609
Yes, ma'am.

27:34.852 --> 27:37.184
You'll have to forgive
my son's rudeness.

27:37.354 --> 27:38.878
He gets it from his father.

27:39.089 --> 27:41.114
Well, that's okay, Mrs. Lockwood.

27:41.325 --> 27:43.919
Tyler and I
were just saying good night.

27:48.065 --> 27:51.762
That's what you get
when you bring the trash into the party.

28:29.306 --> 28:31.103
What'd we miss?

28:32.242 --> 28:34.574
We were just chatting.

28:35.179 --> 28:36.510
Drink, Damon?

28:37.448 --> 28:39.109
No, thanks, I'll pass.

28:43.621 --> 28:46.283
Stefan, do you have
another dance in you?

28:47.591 --> 28:49.024
Absolutely.

29:05.509 --> 29:08.000
They look so cute together.

29:08.212 --> 29:10.043
Don't talk, please.

29:22.059 --> 29:24.220
Don't shoot. Only need to refill.

29:24.962 --> 29:28.796
- Shooting implies caring.
- Feigned indifference. I like it.

29:28.999 --> 29:30.626
I'm over the banter, Logan.

29:31.335 --> 29:34.133
I'd really rather you just left me alone.

29:37.641 --> 29:39.632
I'm sorry, Jenna.

29:40.044 --> 29:41.978
About your sister.

29:45.015 --> 29:46.744
Thank you.

29:47.518 --> 29:49.486
I came to the funeral.

29:50.087 --> 29:52.851
I know. I saw you.

29:53.057 --> 29:56.857
I didn't wanna push my way in,
but I wanted to be there for you.

29:57.061 --> 30:01.361
And when I heard you were staying
in Mystic Falls, I thought maybe...

30:01.532 --> 30:04.592
Well, maybe I could have
a second chance to make things right.

30:13.277 --> 30:15.609
Her name was Monica, wasn't it?

30:35.632 --> 30:39.762
I hope Damon
didn't drive you too crazy.

30:39.937 --> 30:42.963
No, actually,
he was on good behavior.

30:43.140 --> 30:47.736
He even apologized and explained
why he is the way he is.

30:49.146 --> 30:51.637
That it all goes back to Katherine.

30:52.516 --> 30:54.006
Hmm.

31:01.091 --> 31:03.719
So tell me about her. What happened?

31:06.797 --> 31:08.526
Not something I like to talk about.

31:08.732 --> 31:11.428
I get that. I do.

31:11.602 --> 31:14.093
I just want you to know that you can.

31:14.271 --> 31:17.604
I mean, I burden you
with all of my drama...

31:17.775 --> 31:21.108
...and I want you to do the same.

31:23.213 --> 31:25.010
Um...

31:25.616 --> 31:27.174
Thank you.

31:29.486 --> 31:33.616
The truth is, Stefan, I don't really know
that much about you...

31:33.791 --> 31:36.851
...and I'd really love it
if you would open up to me.

31:37.594 --> 31:39.653
Damon said something, didn't he?

31:39.830 --> 31:43.425
He likes to play games
and cause trouble, Elena.

31:43.634 --> 31:46.865
This isn't about Damon,
it's about me trying to get to know you.

31:48.105 --> 31:50.699
Look, you're the mystery guy
and I like that...

31:50.874 --> 31:54.810
...but with mystery comes secrets,
and this thing with Katherine...

31:55.012 --> 31:56.570
Let it go.

31:56.780 --> 31:59.772
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Say something about yourself.

31:59.950 --> 32:01.042
Anything.

32:01.218 --> 32:04.654
Otherwise, I'm left with nothing
but what other people tell me.

32:04.855 --> 32:07.653
Don't you see
what Damon has done here?

32:07.825 --> 32:10.692
He's trying to get you
to turn against me.

32:13.030 --> 32:15.396
Well, then I guess it's working.

32:28.545 --> 32:30.638

32:34.384 --> 32:35.408
I feel terrible.

32:35.619 --> 32:39.180
I said I wouldn't get in the middle of it
and that's exactly what I did.

32:40.057 --> 32:42.048

Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Lockwood.

32:51.835 --> 32:54.827
I couldn't find it.

32:55.005 --> 32:58.236
I guess, it's still packed up
in my parents' stuff somewhere.

32:58.909 --> 33:01.935
I see.
Please let me know if you do find it.

Where have you been?

33:12.656 --> 33:14.749
I've been looking for you.

33:15.792 --> 33:18.283
Your brother barely danced with me
for five minutes.

33:18.462 --> 33:22.159
Okay, just a minute. Stand right there.

33:29.339 --> 33:32.206
Uh... You're not supposed to touch.

33:34.478 --> 33:35.536
What is that?

33:35.712 --> 33:37.407
Very important crystal.

33:37.581 --> 33:39.549
Well, how did you know
that it was there?

33:39.716 --> 33:41.308
<font color="#808080">DAMON :</font> Because I put it there.
- When?

33:41.485 --> 33:42.543

Tonight, I'm taking it back,
thanks to you.

33:45.322 --> 33:46.380
Well, what's it for?

33:46.556 --> 33:48.547
- Never you mind.
- You can't just steal it.

33:48.725 --> 33:51.193
- It's not stealing if it's mine. Come on.
- Well...

33:52.229 --> 33:53.719
Vodka tonic.

34:02.706 --> 34:05.504
Okay, I know that this is probably
gonna be strike three...

34:05.709 --> 34:09.145
...but I hope you can see it
for what it is.

34:09.313 --> 34:11.076
- And what is it?
- Persistence.

34:11.281 --> 34:14.114
Groveling, commitment.
Take your pick.

34:14.318 --> 34:16.478
I fled town because of you. Fled.

34:16.652 --> 34:20.315
I was young and stupid,
and then things changed.

34:20.489 --> 34:24.654
Life got real.

34:24.828 --> 34:27.295
You'd know that better than anyone.

34:29.099 --> 34:34.435
Hypothetically speaking, if allowed,
how would you make things right?

34:34.638 --> 34:36.799
Well, more groveling, of course.

34:36.974 --> 34:40.273
A recap of the past few years
spent soul searching.

35:01.298 --> 35:04.131
Flames, the candles.
Why aren't they lit?

35:06.069 --> 35:08.537
There's matches in the kitchen.

35:15.045 --> 35:16.069

35:49.312 --> 35:51.678
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:53.417 --> 35:55.510
So how are things with Stefan?

35:55.685 --> 35:57.414
Great. Just great.

35:57.587 --> 35:58.849
Really?

35:59.589 --> 36:01.022
Well, my radar must be off...

36:01.191 --> 36:04.592
...because I was getting all sorts
of other vibes.

36:06.396 --> 36:08.261
What is that?

36:10.100 --> 36:11.124
Don't.

36:11.868 --> 36:14.063
- Caroline, what happened?
- Nothing, okay?

36:14.237 --> 36:15.363
That is not nothing.

36:15.539 --> 36:17.404
- Did somebody hurt you?
- No, okay, it...

36:17.574 --> 36:19.337
Nothing, it just...

36:20.410 --> 36:22.469
My mom would kill me.

36:23.547 --> 36:26.243
- Did Damon hurt you?
- No.

36:26.416 --> 36:28.213
Of course not.

36:28.418 --> 36:31.854
Just leave me alone,
okay, Elena? God.

36:44.434 --> 36:46.493
There is something
seriously wrong with you.

36:46.736 --> 36:50.672
You stay away from Caroline
or I will go to her mother, the sheriff.

36:50.907 --> 36:54.741
You got it? Stay away from her.

37:03.253 --> 37:04.447
I'm sorry.

37:05.021 --> 37:06.181
I take it all back.

37:06.423 --> 37:08.914
- You're right about Damon.
- What did he do?

37:09.126 --> 37:12.027
There are bruises
all over Caroline's body.

37:12.195 --> 37:15.631
Bite marks. And he has her all confused
and messed up in the head.

37:18.835 --> 37:21.099
You don't look surprised.

37:24.908 --> 37:26.170
I'm handling it.

37:26.409 --> 37:29.640
Handling it? Stefan, you should be
having him arrested.

37:29.846 --> 37:32.940
Elena, please, l...

37:33.116 --> 37:36.552
- I don't expect you to understand.
- I don't understand anything, Stefan.

37:37.020 --> 37:39.011
So why don't you
just clear it up for me?

37:39.189 --> 37:41.987
Look, there are things
that you don't know, okay?

37:42.159 --> 37:45.128
Things that I want to tell you,
but I can't.

37:45.328 --> 37:47.626
And I may never be able to.

37:48.165 --> 37:49.792
And I just need you to trust me.

37:51.501 --> 37:53.332
Trust is earned.

make one more wrong choice today.

38:47.390 --> 38:48.880
Don't.
