Yesterday was quite good.

11:59.980 --> 12:02.286
Today was
good in early morning,

12:02.330 --> 12:06.247

estimate about an hour.

12:10.468 --> 12:14.646
In Lamborn, Illinois,
there's far more jet noise,

12:14.690 --> 12:16.518
and at times
it is very annoying.

12:16.561 --> 12:18.912
But it does not disturb
me nearly as much as does

12:18.955 --> 12:22.785

because here the noise destroys

while in the city

12:25.701 --> 12:27.790

and I'm going to run

He shouldn't have got married.

have married her, Ma.

Well, I still love him,
Ma, but I don't--

18:18.097 --> 18:19.881
I have nothing
in common with David.

18:19.924 --> 18:21.970
He was jealous of the fact
that I could do most

18:22.013 --> 18:23.276
things better than he could.

18:23.319 --> 18:24.886
It's a simple fact, Ma.

Well, yeah, he was better
socially than I was, but...

18:29.760 --> 18:32.415
Well, if you hadn't put me
two years ahead in high school,

18:32.459 --> 18:34.852
perhaps I would have
the ability to-- to hold

18:34.896 --> 18:37.594

longer than 30 seconds.

18:37.638 --> 18:39.161

got to first base, Ma.

You know what first base is?

Yeah, kissing, tongue rubbing.

Yeah.
I have tongue rubbed twice.

Twice. That's all. Nothing.
No-- no touching of breasts.

18:52.740 --> 18:54.176
No sexual intercourse.

Well,
who do you want me to tell?

Of course,
I would rather be miserable

by that humiliating method.

30:56.376 --> 30:58.987
Excuse me.
How much... how much is this?

30:59.031 --> 31:00.336
-25 cents.

31:05.341 --> 31:07.256
-Okay,
I'll think about it.

31:12.566 --> 31:14.655
-Doing some
entertaining there, Ted?

31:16.831 --> 31:18.093
-No.

31:18.137 --> 31:19.442
Just need cutlery.

31:20.226 --> 31:23.272
-Don't have a wife
to chew my food and regurgitate

31:23.316 --> 31:24.970
it into my mouth.
[chuckles awkwardly]

31:25.796 --> 31:27.059
-Fair enough.

31:38.766 --> 31:40.420
Since committing the crimes

31:40.463 --> 31:42.988
reported elsewhere in my notes,
I feel better.

31:43.031 --> 31:45.512
I'm still plenty angry,
you understand,

31:45.555 --> 31:48.471
but the difference is that
I am now able to strike back

31:48.515 --> 31:50.212
to a degree.

31:51.344 --> 31:55.783
True, I can't strike back
to anything like the extent

31:55.826 --> 31:58.481
I wish to, but I no longer
feel totally helpless,

31:58.525 --> 32:01.876
and the anger doesn't
gnaw my guts as it used to.

32:04.009 --> 32:07.186
Guilty feelings? Yes, a little.

32:07.229 --> 32:11.016
Occasionally, I have bad dreams
in which police are after me,

32:11.059 --> 32:13.844
or which I am threatened
with punishment

32:13.888 --> 32:17.196
from a supernatural source
such as the devil.

32:19.154 --> 32:21.722
But these don't occur
often enough to be a problem.

32:23.115 --> 32:27.075
I am definitely glad
to have done what I have.

32:27.119 --> 32:28.511
[music fades out]

32:31.950 --> 32:34.343
[shovel digging]

32:46.051 --> 32:47.356

33:15.950 --> 33:17.734

33:30.356 --> 33:31.748

[explosion booms]

34:40.556 --> 34:41.905
[coughing]

34:54.092 --> 34:55.571
Here comes a tough one.

34:55.615 --> 34:58.531
So, four numbers.

34:59.793 --> 35:01.751
Keeping the seven
in the same place.

35:01.795 --> 35:03.405
Mm-hmm.

35:03.449 --> 35:05.886
-Create the greatest
and the smallest number

35:05.929 --> 35:08.149
in a combination
of those four digits.

35:08.193 --> 35:10.064
I'm going to give you a hint.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.674
The zero, seven, five,
four is a three-digit number.

35:12.806 --> 35:14.112
Okay?
-Mm-hmm.

35:15.330 --> 35:16.636
-Mm-hmm.

35:17.202 --> 35:19.029
Yeah, what's the greatest
and smallest number

35:19.073 --> 35:20.988
for those four digits?

35:26.820 --> 35:28.126
Mm-hmm.

35:29.518 --> 35:30.998
[chuckling softly]

35:31.041 --> 35:32.521
Nice. Remarkable.

35:34.784 --> 35:36.090
That's fantastic.

35:37.004 --> 35:40.616
The smallest.
He's really coming along.

35:40.660 --> 35:42.314
He is really smart.

35:42.357 --> 35:44.011
I think you've
probably done enough.

35:44.054 --> 35:47.145
Yeah. All this math
does give me a headache.

35:47.188 --> 35:48.842
-That's what we want.

35:48.885 --> 35:50.626
[all laughing]

36:28.403 --> 36:31.319
In Montana,
if I went to the city to mail

36:31.363 --> 36:34.888
a bomb to some big shot,
the driver would doubtless

36:34.931 --> 36:37.499
remember
I rode the bus that day.

36:37.543 --> 36:41.286
In the anonymity of the big
city, I figured it would be

36:41.329 --> 36:45.290
much safer to buy materials
for a bomb and mail it.

36:45.333 --> 36:48.118
[whistling "Ode To Joy"]

36:51.383 --> 36:52.688

[high-pitched voice]
I wanna fuck you.

37:40.040 --> 37:42.347
[low voice]
I want to fuck you too, yeah.

37:46.873 --> 37:51.965
Nice ass. Nice tits. Face, meh.

37:52.008 --> 37:53.575
[laughing softly]

37:57.057 --> 37:59.059
I could end this bitch.

38:04.020 --> 38:06.501
[moody jazz music]

38:35.748 --> 38:37.053
[music fades out]

38:45.410 --> 38:46.715
-What are you reading about?

38:47.542 --> 38:49.892
-The psychology of women.

38:49.936 --> 38:52.199
I'm reading, I have work to do.

38:52.242 --> 38:54.419
I'm--
-Oh, yeah?

38:54.462 --> 38:55.855
-[aggressively] Mm-hmm.

38:55.898 --> 38:58.597
-What do you do?
-I'm a psychiatrist.

38:58.640 --> 39:00.599
-No shit.
-Yeah.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.212
Please do not
tell me your troubles.

39:05.255 --> 39:07.562
-[both laughing]
-Right.

39:09.912 --> 39:11.871
What do you...
what do you do for a living?

39:13.786 --> 39:16.571
-I just got out of prison.
I gotta go get a job.

39:16.615 --> 39:17.964
-Sure.

39:18.007 --> 39:20.358
[pensive music]

39:26.712 --> 39:29.802
-Maybe I'll go
be a psychiatrist now.

39:29.845 --> 39:31.804
[passenger chuckling]

39:33.109 --> 39:36.635
-Um, excuse me,
I have to--

39:36.678 --> 39:38.245
Hey.

39:38.288 --> 39:40.943
-I have to get
the fuck out of here.

39:42.902 --> 39:44.207
Have a good trip.

40:03.009 --> 40:04.314
[music fades out]

40:23.377 --> 40:25.074
[door buzzing]

40:31.429 --> 40:34.693
-Evening. I need a...

40:34.736 --> 40:36.085
room for one.

40:36.129 --> 40:41.264
-Name?
-It's Conrad. Joseph Conrad.

40:43.049 --> 40:46.618
Um, how much?
-$19.95.

40:49.838 --> 40:51.318
[rock music playing]

40:57.237 --> 40:58.499
[key clanging]

41:04.897 --> 41:06.246

41:07.552 --> 41:08.857
Change?

41:08.901 --> 41:10.380
[nickel clanging]

41:10.424 --> 41:12.208
Call me if you need anything.

the internal investigation

41:52.205 --> 41:54.294
and report to council
raised many questions,

41:54.337 --> 41:56.775
and it should be noted to date,
there has been no independent

41:56.818 --> 42:00.169
investigation on why it took
more than a year to arrest

42:00.213 --> 42:03.477
the son of a city councilman,
the son of a sheriff's deputy

42:03.521 --> 42:05.784
and the son of Shipley's
administrative assistant

in connection with two
burglaries in the city.

45:08.749 --> 45:10.795
I mean, you can--
The middle name is business.

45:12.057 --> 45:13.798
Watch this.
If I'm typing away--

45:13.841 --> 45:15.408
See, I made a mistake there.

45:15.451 --> 45:17.279
I typed "A"
when I wanted an "S,"

45:17.323 --> 45:19.238
so if I just hit this key twice,

45:19.281 --> 45:22.284
backspace there, I could
change that "A" to an "S."

45:22.328 --> 45:24.069
[voice distorting]
And away I go.

-The owner is behind

with the moustache.

45:36.908 --> 45:38.213
Oh.

45:39.127 --> 45:41.260
I mean, would you like
me to get him for you?

45:41.303 --> 45:42.609
-Oh, no.
-Okay.

45:42.652 --> 45:43.915
-Thank you.

-You're welcome.

45:45.220 --> 45:47.962
-This is interesting. Thank you.

45:48.006 --> 45:49.790
I need to-- need to go.

45:49.834 --> 45:52.967
But I'll think about
it and... get back to you.

45:53.011 --> 45:54.882
Come back anytime.
I'm always here.

46:02.934 --> 46:04.805
My motive for doing

46:04.849 --> 46:07.286
what I'm going to do
is simply personal revenge.

46:07.329 --> 46:10.942
I do not expect to
accomplish anything it.

46:10.985 --> 46:14.119
Of course, if my crime
and reasons for committing

46:14.162 --> 46:17.339
it gets any public attention,
it may help to stimulate

46:17.383 --> 46:19.907
public interest
in a technology question

46:19.951 --> 46:22.040
and thereby improve
the chances of stopping

46:22.083 --> 46:24.129
technology
before it's too late.

46:24.172 --> 46:26.740
But on the other hand,
most people will probably

46:26.784 --> 46:28.786
be repelled by my crime.

46:28.829 --> 46:31.658
The opponents of freedom may
use it as a weapon to support

46:31.701 --> 46:34.748
their arguments for control
over human behavior.

46:34.792 --> 46:37.359
With no way of knowing
whether my action will do

46:37.403 --> 46:40.841
more good than harm,
I certainly don't claim to be

46:40.885 --> 46:43.713
an altruist
or to be acting for the good,

46:43.757 --> 46:45.672
whatever that is,
of the human race.

46:45.715 --> 46:49.197
I act merely for my
desire for revenge.

tonight, huh?

Nice cough. You all right?

47:23.928 --> 47:25.625
-No.

47:25.668 --> 47:27.409
-You don't look so good.

47:28.454 --> 47:29.672
Here.

47:29.716 --> 47:31.892
Here's 40 for tonight,

47:32.588 --> 47:37.855
And get yourself something
else to drink, too, no charge.

47:40.422 --> 47:44.035
And I got some Old Spice
back there, on the house.

49:22.307 --> 49:24.091
At this hour,
police still have

49:24.135 --> 49:26.354
no leads in the package
bombing in Lake Forest.

49:26.398 --> 49:28.226
Chuck Goudie is here
with the latest

49:28.269 --> 49:30.315
in the investigation
to that story. Chuck.

49:30.358 --> 49:32.143
Jack, a couple
of days ago, Percy Wood

49:32.186 --> 49:35.537
received a letter from somebody
named Enoch Fisher.

49:35.581 --> 49:37.235
The letter informed
of when to expect a book

49:37.278 --> 49:39.411
in the mail very soon.

49:39.454 --> 49:41.543
But when he got the book
it blew up in his face.

49:41.587 --> 49:44.068
The return address:
3414 West Ravenswood Avenue.

49:44.111 --> 49:45.939
It didn't help much.

49:45.983 --> 49:48.202
It's a vacant lot.
So, police are hoping

49:48.246 --> 49:51.379
for better luck with clues
the explosion left behind.

49:51.423 --> 49:54.643
Today, inside
Wood's home, investigators

49:54.687 --> 49:56.471
finished picking up
pieces of the bomb.

49:56.515 --> 49:58.647
That was nerve-wracking.

49:58.691 --> 50:00.345
Metal fragments were scattered
throughout the kitchen and had

50:00.388 --> 50:02.173
to be separated
from bits of glass and paper.

50:02.216 --> 50:04.175
The evidence
recovered from the home

50:04.218 --> 50:07.961
of Mr. Hood-- Mr. Wood was
in good condition and has been

50:08.005 --> 50:09.919
dispatched by courier to
the Postal Inspection

50:09.963 --> 50:12.531
Service Crime Laboratory
in Washington, DC.

50:13.749 --> 50:15.447
The parcel wrapping,

50:15.490 --> 50:17.449
the packing and portions
of the bomb itself

50:17.492 --> 50:20.365
will be analyzed by
the laboratory technicians

50:20.408 --> 50:23.150
and they will
furnish us a full report.

50:23.194 --> 50:25.370
At this time, we are unable

50:25.413 --> 50:28.242
to release any details
on the makeup of the bomb.

50:29.374 --> 50:32.029
We have initiated
an intense investigation

50:32.072 --> 50:34.074
to solve the attack
upon Mr. Wood.

50:34.118 --> 50:36.511
Recently,
Percy Wood outfitted his home

50:36.555 --> 50:38.905

security system

50:38.948 --> 50:40.428

open the front door

50:40.472 --> 50:42.561
if a stranger was outside.

50:42.604 --> 50:44.737
Like most of us,
though, he opens mail.

50:44.780 --> 50:46.565
Not knowing what's inside.

50:46.608 --> 50:48.393
-"It will never happen to me,"

50:48.436 --> 50:51.091
is the way that
most people look at it.

50:51.135 --> 50:54.181
Yourself, how many times
have you opened your mail

50:54.225 --> 50:57.097
and thought that there might
have been something in it?

51:07.194 --> 51:09.544

You got a--

51:39.835 --> 51:42.577
Yeah, I'm fucking angry
with the car, asshole.

51:43.883 --> 51:45.885
You wanna know
who told us my wife?

51:45.928 --> 51:47.626
Your goddamn brother.

51:47.669 --> 51:49.541

54:21.780 --> 54:24.304

54:25.740 --> 54:29.744
Exxon conducting
seismic exploration for oil.

54:36.403 --> 54:39.624
Couple of helicopters
flying all over the hills.

54:39.667 --> 54:41.843
Lower, I think,
dynamite on cable.

54:41.887 --> 54:43.802
Make blast on ground,

54:43.845 --> 54:45.760
instruments
smash through vibrations.

54:51.810 --> 54:56.075
I camped out mostly in
what I call the diagonal gulch,

54:56.118 --> 55:00.297
hoping to shoot up a helicopter
in an area east of Crater Mount.

55:03.735 --> 55:05.258
[gunshot]

55:05.302 --> 55:07.391
It proved harder than I thought.

55:07.434 --> 55:09.697
Those helicopters
always in motion,

55:09.741 --> 55:12.047
never know
where they would go next.

Fuck.

55:56.831 --> 55:58.746
Desecration.

55:58.790 --> 56:01.619
Where can I go now
for peace and quiet?

56:01.662 --> 56:05.057
[somber music]

56:07.538 --> 56:09.975
When I got
back to camp, I cried.

56:10.018 --> 56:12.107
Partly from
frustration of missing,

56:12.151 --> 56:14.675
but mostly grief about what
was happening to the country.

56:14.719 --> 56:16.503
Fuck!

56:16.547 --> 56:18.418
Fuck you!

56:18.462 --> 56:20.986
It is so beautiful.

56:21.029 --> 56:24.903
But if they did find oil...
disaster.

56:24.946 --> 56:28.689
Even if not find oil, the blast
and helicopters ruin it.

-Hey, there, Ted.

57:29.576 --> 57:31.883
-Hello, Mrs. Hill.
-I'm so glad you're here.

57:31.926 --> 57:33.928
-You ready to work?
-Yes. What can I do?

57:33.972 --> 57:35.539
-Let's head back this way.

57:37.497 --> 57:40.108
I'm gonna put you
in the back with Becky,

57:40.152 --> 57:42.371
and we have
this huge pile of books

57:42.415 --> 57:44.112
that we have to sort through.

57:44.156 --> 57:46.985
Unfortunately, we have
to get rid of all of them.

57:47.028 --> 57:50.945
So I'm gonna have you guys
split them up by genre and...

58:07.048 --> 58:08.572
[sighing]

58:15.579 --> 58:21.541

58:28.461 --> 58:30.245
-Hi.
-Hi.

58:30.289 --> 58:31.943
-I'm Becky.

58:31.986 --> 58:35.337
-I'm-- I'm Ted Kaczynksi.

58:44.912 --> 58:48.307
They should really move
from the Dewey Decimal System

58:48.350 --> 58:51.658
to the Library
of Congress system.

58:52.616 --> 58:56.663
I'd suggested it a while back,
but they still haven't, so,

58:56.707 --> 58:59.318
now we have
to do all this again.

59:09.197 --> 59:11.373
[laughing]

59:11.417 --> 59:13.114
Um...

59:26.606 --> 59:27.825
No, we're--

59:51.283 --> 59:53.590
[change falling in payphone]

1:00:02.947 --> 1:00:04.601
[whispering] Fuck.

1:00:15.350 --> 1:00:17.962
Ugh. Goddamn it.

1:00:36.328 --> 1:00:38.373
Hi, David, it's me. Yeah.

1:00:41.028 --> 1:00:42.856
Yeah, because I was...

1:00:42.900 --> 1:00:46.686
I was calling to talk to you
and she picked up. And I--

1:00:46.730 --> 1:00:49.254
Well, I thought... I--

1:00:49.297 --> 1:00:50.734
I wanted to speak
to you, not her.

1:00:50.777 --> 1:00:52.387
I've never met her.
I thought it was

1:00:52.431 --> 1:00:54.389
a bad time to try
to meet her over the phone.

1:00:54.433 --> 1:00:56.348
And so I... so I hung up.

1:00:56.391 --> 1:00:59.525
Well, can I be trusted to say

1:00:59.568 --> 1:01:01.440
the right thing to--
to a woman, David?

1:01:01.483 --> 1:01:04.573
Especially Linda,
with the history, and...

1:01:04.617 --> 1:01:06.619
Oh my God, is that her
in the background?

1:01:06.663 --> 1:01:07.925
David, fuck.

1:01:11.755 --> 1:01:15.149
Just tell her I apologize
and ask her to leave the room

1:01:15.193 --> 1:01:17.064
so I can talk to you
in private, please.

1:01:17.108 --> 1:01:19.066
You domesticated yourself.

1:01:19.110 --> 1:01:21.590
You're like, like,
like a horse that's run

1:01:21.634 --> 1:01:24.332
into a farmer's field and...

1:01:24.376 --> 1:01:26.247
and volunteered for somebody
to jump on your back

1:01:26.291 --> 1:01:28.510
and put a bit in your mouth.

1:01:28.554 --> 1:01:31.731
Well, I thought that
we shared a lot of values

1:01:31.775 --> 1:01:33.733
and I thought that we were on

1:01:33.777 --> 1:01:35.735
the same page of
living in the wild.

1:01:35.779 --> 1:01:39.696
Now you're living in a zoo like
a caged animal with a trainer.

1:01:39.739 --> 1:01:42.481
A trainer who, uh,

1:01:42.524 --> 1:01:46.006
who you need
to run everything by. Um...

1:01:47.225 --> 1:01:49.140
I'm sure--
oh, I bet you have too.

1:01:49.183 --> 1:01:50.750
Like if I--
if I asked you-- I was--

1:01:50.794 --> 1:01:52.230
I was actually gonna call to ask

1:01:52.273 --> 1:01:54.449
for some help,
some financial help.

1:01:54.493 --> 1:01:56.147
I just wanted
a little money that I could...

1:01:56.190 --> 1:01:58.758
that I could repay.
But I'm sure you have--

1:01:58.802 --> 1:02:00.499
Yeah, you would have--

1:02:00.542 --> 1:02:02.544
Yes, you would have to ask her,
wouldn't you?

1:02:02.588 --> 1:02:04.329
Mm-hmm.

1:02:04.372 --> 1:02:06.244
See, that's what I mean.

1:05:39.805 --> 1:05:41.546

-Good morning.
-Morning. Nice day.

1:07:07.806 --> 1:07:09.242
Yeah.

1:07:09.286 --> 1:07:11.027
-You know, just checking
through the pass

1:07:11.070 --> 1:07:12.680
and a little investigation

1:07:12.724 --> 1:07:14.726
I was hoping
you could help me with.

1:07:14.769 --> 1:07:16.641
You seen anyone, anything,

1:07:16.684 --> 1:07:19.122
people, fooling around
with any buildings around here?

1:07:19.165 --> 1:07:21.559
-No, only those, uh...

kids who vandalized
that cabin a while back.

1:07:24.649 --> 1:07:25.954
Nothing since then.

1:07:26.651 --> 1:07:28.609
-Sure.
-You talk to Steve or Tom?

1:07:28.653 --> 1:07:31.395
-Yeah, Steve said his mill
got wrecked a while back too.

1:07:31.438 --> 1:07:34.006
-Yeah, a while ago. Yeah.

1:07:34.050 --> 1:07:37.096
-Or, um, motorcyclers,
they hassling you nearby here?

1:07:37.140 --> 1:07:39.838
-No, nothing like
snowmobile season, anyway, huh?

1:07:39.881 --> 1:07:42.406
-Exactly. Right, um...

1:07:42.449 --> 1:07:44.234
The reason I had to ask
was we heard you got

1:07:44.277 --> 1:07:46.845
pretty upset with some riders
from up the creek.

1:07:46.888 --> 1:07:49.195
-Yeah, I did. I did, yeah.

1:07:50.414 --> 1:07:53.504
Yes, assholes, though.
A couple of punks tried to--

1:07:53.547 --> 1:07:57.943
tried to come across my--
my property and, um...

1:07:57.986 --> 1:07:59.249
Yeah.

1:08:00.380 --> 1:08:03.383
I wouldn't call it anything
out of the ordinary, though,

1:08:03.427 --> 1:08:07.387
I imagine if you were
in my position, you would...

1:08:09.781 --> 1:08:11.435
You might act the same way.

1:08:16.266 --> 1:08:18.964
-Sure. Yeah, that's fair.

1:08:19.007 --> 1:08:21.009
I appreciate your time.
If you, uh, hear of anything

1:08:21.053 --> 1:08:22.533
you let me know.

1:08:22.576 --> 1:08:23.882
-Mm-hm.

1:08:53.041 --> 1:08:55.305
-Have a nice day.
-See you, Ted.

let them get their offer,

1:09:20.939 --> 1:09:23.768
because they don't have
credibility with us.

1:09:24.725 --> 1:09:27.511
Some think Earth First
is a terrorist organization,

1:09:27.554 --> 1:09:29.513
and they've
not renounced violence.

1:09:29.556 --> 1:09:32.342
They see a difference
between terrorism and sabotage.

-...the modern industrial
system as we know it,

1:09:52.666 --> 1:09:56.844
and one reason why we see
the modern industrial system

1:09:56.888 --> 1:09:59.804
as being so destructive
is because it's

1:09:59.847 --> 1:10:01.849
based on the premise
that it is for human beings

1:10:01.893 --> 1:10:03.721
that the world exists.

1:10:03.764 --> 1:10:06.637
The idea that human beings
are just another species

But let our action set the finer
points of our philosophy.

We don't have
to figure it all out.

1:11:10.744 --> 1:11:12.964
We all don't have
to be saints on this planet

1:11:13.007 --> 1:11:14.922
to do something for it.

1:11:14.966 --> 1:11:20.798
It's time for a warrior society
to rise up out of the Earth.

1:11:20.841 --> 1:11:23.409
And to put ourselves in front
of the juggernaut

1:11:23.453 --> 1:11:24.758
of destruction.

1:11:32.375 --> 1:11:33.985
We need warriors,

1:11:34.028 --> 1:11:35.943
we need people
and bodies out in the field

to take down the apparatus
of this mechanized destruction

that we have.

1:11:42.428 --> 1:11:44.778

My route took me past
a beautiful spot.

1:12:27.473 --> 1:12:30.998
A favorite place of mine where
there was a spring of pure water

1:12:31.042 --> 1:12:33.174
that can safely
be drunk without worrying.

1:12:34.088 --> 1:12:36.439
I stopped
and said a kind of prayer

1:12:36.482 --> 1:12:39.267
to the spirit of the spring.

1:12:39.311 --> 1:12:41.879
It was a prayer in which I swore

1:12:41.922 --> 1:12:43.794
that I would take revenge

1:12:43.837 --> 1:12:46.318

with the forest.

1:14:15.886 --> 1:14:18.323
have been a disaster
for the human race.

1:14:20.151 --> 1:14:23.502
We therefore
advocate the revolution

1:14:23.546 --> 1:14:25.896
against the industrial system.

1:14:25.939 --> 1:14:29.203
Thirty-seven: we attribute
the social and psychological

1:14:29.247 --> 1:14:32.380
problems with modern society
to the fact that the society

1:14:32.424 --> 1:14:34.861
requires people to live
under conditions

1:14:34.905 --> 1:14:36.950
radically different
from those under which

1:14:36.994 --> 1:14:38.474
the human race evolved.

1:14:39.649 --> 1:14:43.522
Forty-six: in order to avoid
serious psychological problems,

1:14:43.566 --> 1:14:45.219
a human being needs goals

1:14:45.263 --> 1:14:47.352
whose attainment
requires effort.

1:14:48.919 --> 1:14:52.749
Sixty-nine: it is true that
primitive man is powerless

1:14:52.792 --> 1:14:54.751
against some of the things
that threaten him,

1:14:54.794 --> 1:14:56.579
disease, for example,

1:14:56.622 --> 1:15:00.408
but he can accept
the risk of disease stoically.

1:15:00.452 --> 1:15:03.977
One-seventy:
"Oh!" say the technophiles,

1:15:04.021 --> 1:15:06.850
"Science is going to fix that.
We will conquer famine,

1:15:06.893 --> 1:15:09.026
"eliminate
psychological suffering,

1:15:09.069 --> 1:15:10.854
"make everybody
healthy and happy."

1:15:12.377 --> 1:15:13.770
Yeah, sure.

1:15:13.813 --> 1:15:15.685
That's what
they said 200 years ago.

1:15:17.730 --> 1:15:19.689
One-eighty:
When the system becomes

1:15:19.732 --> 1:15:21.778
sufficiently stressed
and unstable,

1:15:21.821 --> 1:15:24.607
a revolution against
technology may be possible.

1:15:27.348 --> 1:15:30.743
One-eighty-one: The technophiles
are taking us all

1:15:30.787 --> 1:15:35.269
on an utterly reckless ride
into the unknown.

1:15:38.185 --> 1:15:41.711
One eighty-five: as
for the negative consequences

1:15:41.754 --> 1:15:43.756
of eliminating
industrial society--

1:15:43.800 --> 1:15:46.411
well, you can't eat your cake
and have it, too.

1:15:46.454 --> 1:15:50.502
To gain one thing you have
to sacrifice another.

1:16:35.678 --> 1:16:37.201
Becky.

1:16:39.333 --> 1:16:42.641
[laughing]

1:16:43.337 --> 1:16:46.776
I got a-- I got a fish!

1:16:46.819 --> 1:16:48.255
I got one!

1:16:48.299 --> 1:16:50.170
Yeah.
-Whoo! Good job!

1:16:50.214 --> 1:16:52.433
-Yeah!

1:16:53.086 --> 1:16:55.132
-Holy--

1:16:55.175 --> 1:16:56.655
That's amazing!

1:16:58.091 --> 1:17:00.920
[Ted chuckling]
It's big!

1:17:08.798 --> 1:17:11.061
[ominous instrumental]

1:17:56.933 --> 1:17:59.936
-No, no, there's nothing that
could ever be important enough

1:17:59.979 --> 1:18:01.502
for you to get in touch with me.

1:18:01.546 --> 1:18:03.548
Even if Mother dies,
I don't wanna hear about it.

1:18:03.591 --> 1:18:05.376
Mm-hmm.

1:18:05.419 --> 1:18:07.595
I have nothing more--
I have nothing more to--

1:18:08.771 --> 1:18:12.078
David-- David.
I just need a yes or no.

1:18:12.122 --> 1:18:13.863
Are you gonna--

1:18:13.906 --> 1:18:16.213
Will you please
help me with money?

1:18:16.256 --> 1:18:17.823
What do you want?
You want me to beg?

1:18:17.867 --> 1:18:20.826
I'm begging, David.
I'm on my fucking knees,

1:18:20.870 --> 1:18:22.567
right in a phone booth,
begging you.

1:18:22.610 --> 1:18:25.265
Do you feel powerful, David?
Do you feel empowered?

1:18:25.962 --> 1:18:28.355
The-- the strong, dominant male.

1:18:28.399 --> 1:18:32.229
Finally, you have your brother
on his knees, asking for money.

1:18:32.272 --> 1:18:35.014
Goddamn it, David!
Cocksucker, man!

1:18:35.058 --> 1:18:37.016
I-- I'm asking for--

1:18:45.024 --> 1:18:47.070
Yes. One thousand.

1:18:49.942 --> 1:18:52.597
Thank you, David.
Yes, I know.

1:18:54.033 --> 1:18:58.255
Yes, it is a brotherly act
and I-- it's noted.

1:19:00.866 --> 1:19:02.433
You too.

1:19:02.476 --> 1:19:04.652
Hugs and kisses to Linda.

1:19:04.696 --> 1:19:06.263
[chuckling]

1:19:06.306 --> 1:19:07.264
Okay.

1:19:23.671 --> 1:19:28.764
[distorted instrumental]

1:19:38.686 --> 1:19:40.645
Boredom is almost non-existent

1:19:40.688 --> 1:19:43.213
once you've become adapted
to life in the woods.

1:19:43.256 --> 1:19:45.519
If you don't have any work
that needs to be done,

1:19:45.563 --> 1:19:48.609
you can sit for hours
at a time, just doing nothing.

1:19:48.653 --> 1:19:52.700
Just listening to the birds
or the wind or the silence.

1:19:52.744 --> 1:19:55.442
Watching the shadows move
as the sun travels

1:19:57.183 --> 1:20:00.230
or simply looking
at familiar objects.

1:20:00.273 --> 1:20:02.536
And you don't get bored.

1:20:02.580 --> 1:20:04.408
You're just a piece.

1:20:38.007 --> 1:20:40.226
[gunshot]

1:20:44.883 --> 1:20:48.974
[airplane engine roaring]

1:21:04.903 --> 1:21:08.776
[sound becomes distorted]

1:21:49.687 --> 1:21:52.211
To the San Francisco Examiner,

1:21:52.255 --> 1:21:54.648
we have waited until now
to announce ourselves

1:21:54.692 --> 1:21:57.825
because our earlier bombs
were embarrassingly ineffectual.

1:21:57.869 --> 1:22:00.959
The injuries they inflicted
were relatively minor.

1:22:01.003 --> 1:22:03.266
In order to influence people,
a terrorist group

1:22:03.309 --> 1:22:06.182
must show a certain
amount of success.

1:22:06.225 --> 1:22:08.967
When we finally realized
the amount of smokeless powder

1:22:09.011 --> 1:22:10.926
needed to blow up
anyone or anything

1:22:10.969 --> 1:22:12.492
was too large to be practical,

1:22:12.536 --> 1:22:14.494
we decided to take
a couple years off

1:22:14.538 --> 1:22:16.105
and learn something
about explosives

1:22:16.148 --> 1:22:18.150
and develop an effective bomb.

1:22:21.414 --> 1:22:23.025
In closure...

1:22:23.068 --> 1:22:25.636
the aim
of the Freedom Club

1:22:25.679 --> 1:22:27.725
is the complete
and permanent destruction

1:22:27.768 --> 1:22:30.206
of modern industrial society
in every part of the world.

1:23:06.982 --> 1:23:08.461
... potentially
by long distance,

1:23:08.505 --> 1:23:10.898
there's not a place

1:23:10.942 --> 1:23:15.033
to have conversation between
the perpetrator and the victims.

1:23:15.077 --> 1:23:18.210
So, the fact that we have

1:23:18.254 --> 1:23:24.521
one eyewitness, which is just
luck on our part, is really...

1:23:24.564 --> 1:23:28.351
We have looked
at all of the victims

1:23:28.394 --> 1:23:31.919
meticulously.
As to any correlation, so far

1:23:31.963 --> 1:23:34.444
it has just not being fruitful.

1:23:34.487 --> 1:23:37.229
Well, you have--
you have a wide range,

1:23:37.273 --> 1:23:39.362
actually, you have
corporate executives,

1:23:39.405 --> 1:23:43.757
you have one bomb placed aboard
an American Airlines aircraft,

1:23:43.801 --> 1:23:45.672
also in the late '70s.

1:23:45.716 --> 1:23:48.327
There have
been college professors.

1:23:48.371 --> 1:23:51.852
Two types of bombs
in the sense that about half

1:23:51.896 --> 1:23:55.987
of them are mailed,
letter bombs or package bombs.

1:23:56.031 --> 1:23:58.163
And about half of them
have been placed

1:23:58.207 --> 1:24:01.166
in a position
where someone would, uh,

1:24:01.210 --> 1:24:03.647
disturb the package.

1:24:03.690 --> 1:24:07.085
[reporter continues
speaking indistinctly]

1:24:10.567 --> 1:24:14.136
Well, as long as I'm going
to throw everything away anyway,

1:24:14.179 --> 1:24:17.704
instead of having to shoot it
out with the cops or something,

1:24:17.748 --> 1:24:20.881
I will go up to Canada,
and take off into the woods

1:24:20.925 --> 1:24:23.623
with a rifle
and try to live off the country.

1:24:23.667 --> 1:24:25.277
If that doesn't work out

1:24:25.321 --> 1:24:27.236
and if I can
get back to civilization

1:24:27.279 --> 1:24:29.629
before I starve,
then I will come back here

1:24:29.673 --> 1:24:32.328
and kill someone I hate.

1:24:37.202 --> 1:24:39.900
I need to renew my passport.

1:24:40.814 --> 1:24:42.251
And...

1:25:30.081 --> 1:25:31.735
Clearly, we are in a position

1:25:31.778 --> 1:25:33.780
to do a great deal of damage.

1:25:33.824 --> 1:25:35.347
And it doesn't appear
that the FBI

1:25:35.391 --> 1:25:37.654
is gonna catch
us anytime soon.

1:25:39.699 --> 1:25:42.441
The FBI is a joke.

1:25:57.761 --> 1:26:00.851
FBI, suck my cock.

1:26:03.158 --> 1:26:05.072
[explosion rumbling]

1:26:07.336 --> 1:26:12.210
[alarm bell ringing]

1:26:32.187 --> 1:26:33.797
[clearing throat]

1:26:36.278 --> 1:26:37.583
[dinging bell]

1:26:42.936 --> 1:26:45.156
-Morning.
-Uh, morning.

1:26:46.244 --> 1:26:50.553
I have a complaint about
the Montana Telephone Company.

1:26:50.596 --> 1:26:54.513
It concerns, uh, some of your
payphones in Lincoln, Montana.

1:26:54.557 --> 1:26:58.256
These pay phones consistently
malfunction in such a manner

1:26:58.300 --> 1:27:01.085
as to steal a caller's quarters.

1:27:01.128 --> 1:27:03.392
You put a quarter in and then
it either gets jammed

1:27:03.435 --> 1:27:05.350
or it doesn't register.

1:27:05.394 --> 1:27:06.960
And then the coin release
doesn't work

1:27:07.004 --> 1:27:08.875
so that either you can't
put the call through

1:27:08.919 --> 1:27:11.400
and the quarters are lost,
or the call does go through,

1:27:11.443 --> 1:27:13.793
but you end up paying 25 cents
or 50 cents more

1:27:13.837 --> 1:27:15.142
than the price of the call.

1:27:16.100 --> 1:27:18.581
This problem has persisted
for several years.

1:27:21.758 --> 1:27:24.151
This is not the first time
that I have, uh--

1:27:24.195 --> 1:27:26.502
that I have complained,
although it is the first time

1:27:26.545 --> 1:27:28.112
that I've complained in person,

1:27:28.155 --> 1:27:29.940
but I've spoken to
the operators about it

1:27:29.983 --> 1:27:32.247
several times and nothing
has been done over the years.

1:27:33.073 --> 1:27:35.554
The main offender
is actually the payphone

1:27:35.598 --> 1:27:37.991
on the corner of Highway 200
and Stemple Pass.

1:27:38.035 --> 1:27:40.255
I'm forced to use that one
on occasion because

1:27:40.298 --> 1:27:41.821
it's the only one
that the company provides

1:27:41.865 --> 1:27:44.563
that offers any level
of privacy at all.

1:27:44.607 --> 1:27:47.262
But it steals at least
50% of my quarters.

1:27:47.305 --> 1:27:48.828
It swindles me.

1:27:48.872 --> 1:27:51.266
And the company is aware
of this offending booth.

1:27:51.962 --> 1:27:53.790
That's a criminal act.

1:27:53.833 --> 1:27:55.531
My money is being stolen.

1:27:58.055 --> 1:27:59.709
-On behalf
of the Montana phone company,

1:27:59.752 --> 1:28:02.842
I apologize
for your inconvenience.

1:28:02.886 --> 1:28:05.192
Uh, do you happen
to have a record

1:28:05.236 --> 1:28:06.977
of how much money
you've lost over the years?

1:28:07.020 --> 1:28:09.153
I do. $5.75.

1:28:09.196 --> 1:28:12.939
-$5.75?
-Yes. Yes, this year.

1:28:12.983 --> 1:28:14.289
-This year.
-Yes.

1:28:14.332 --> 1:28:16.029
-Hmm.

1:28:16.073 --> 1:28:19.206
-I have a letter
which, uh, you could give

1:28:19.250 --> 1:28:23.080
to your superiors,
and it contains all the details

1:28:23.123 --> 1:28:25.952
that I have
just relayed to you now.

1:28:25.996 --> 1:28:29.129
-I would love to give
it to my superiors, but...

1:28:29.173 --> 1:28:32.394
we can only accept letters
through the post.

1:28:33.438 --> 1:28:35.310
I can't hand deliver a letter.

1:28:36.354 --> 1:28:37.921
Do you see the problem?

1:28:44.667 --> 1:28:48.105
-I came in here to bring
you the letter in person.

1:28:48.148 --> 1:28:49.411
-I appreciate that.

1:28:50.847 --> 1:28:52.283
But I can't take it.

1:29:13.304 --> 1:29:15.306
You have a wonderful day.

1:29:15.350 --> 1:29:17.526
I'm gonna write to
my congressman about this.

1:29:17.569 --> 1:29:19.092
Okay.

1:29:19.136 --> 1:29:25.403
[dreamy, melancholic
instrumental]

1:30:15.671 --> 1:30:17.586
[Ted]
During my romantic phase,

1:30:17.629 --> 1:30:21.154
I continued to have fantasies
of a primitive life,

1:30:21.198 --> 1:30:23.243
but I tended strongly
to embellish

1:30:23.287 --> 1:30:27.900
this with romantic details
like horns resounding through

1:30:27.944 --> 1:30:31.121
the forest, savage-looking
tunics and bearskin

1:30:31.164 --> 1:30:32.427
and so forth.

1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:27.307
Sequence of small advances,
there will be no rational

1:31:27.351 --> 1:31:29.571
and effective public resistance.

1:31:29.614 --> 1:31:32.835
It is not possible to make
a lasting compromise

1:31:32.878 --> 1:31:35.098
between technology and freedom

1:31:35.141 --> 1:31:38.188
because technology is by far
the more powerful social force

1:31:38.231 --> 1:31:39.885
and continually...

1:31:39.929 --> 1:31:43.454
erodes on freedom
through repeated compromise.

1:31:45.325 --> 1:31:46.718
[muttering indistinctly]

1:32:01.603 --> 1:32:04.431
As society
and the problems that face it

1:32:04.475 --> 1:32:06.259
become more and more complex,

1:32:06.303 --> 1:32:09.132
and as machines become
more and more intelligent,

1:32:09.175 --> 1:32:12.048
people will let machines
make more and more

1:32:12.091 --> 1:32:14.006
of their decisions for them,

1:32:14.050 --> 1:32:16.269
simply because
machine-made decisions

1:32:16.313 --> 1:32:19.577
will bring better results
than manmade ones.

1:32:22.362 --> 1:32:24.451
Eventually,
a stage may be reached

1:32:24.495 --> 1:32:26.628
at which the decisions
necessary to keep

1:32:26.671 --> 1:32:29.239
the system running will be
so complex that human beings

1:32:29.282 --> 1:32:32.329
will be incapable
of making them intelligently.

1:32:32.372 --> 1:32:35.637
At that stage, the machines
will be in effective control.

1:32:35.680 --> 1:32:38.378
People won't be able
to just turn the machines

1:32:38.422 --> 1:32:40.424
off because they will
be so dependent on them

1:32:40.467 --> 1:32:42.818
that turning them
off would amount to suicide.

1:32:46.604 --> 1:32:49.955
[loud thud, horn honking]

1:32:58.964 --> 1:33:01.097
[man groaning]

1:33:01.140 --> 1:33:04.361
[men laughing]

1:33:06.450 --> 1:33:10.149
[laughter continues]

1:33:13.022 --> 1:33:18.288
[laughing]

1:33:18.331 --> 1:33:21.683
-I must have been going
40 fucking miles per hour.

1:33:21.726 --> 1:33:24.903
[laughing]

1:33:33.782 --> 1:33:37.829
[chain clanking]
[screeching]

1:34:03.986 --> 1:34:06.162
-You know, my parents...

1:34:06.205 --> 1:34:10.035
pushed me so hard in academia,
I never really learned

1:34:10.079 --> 1:34:12.559
to be at ease around women.

1:34:12.603 --> 1:34:14.431
-Can you tell me your heart,
Ted?

1:34:15.650 --> 1:34:17.303
You're quite right.

1:34:17.347 --> 1:34:18.565
You love me.

1:34:19.088 --> 1:34:20.393
-I do.

1:34:21.438 --> 1:34:24.136
I do. See, actually, uh...

1:34:24.180 --> 1:34:25.964
It's the truth. I love you.

1:34:26.008 --> 1:34:28.532
I love you so much I'm gonna
let go of these handlebars.

1:34:28.575 --> 1:34:30.708
-No, don't do it!
-I'm gonna let go!

1:34:30.752 --> 1:34:32.492
-No, please don't.
-Okay, one hand.

1:34:32.536 --> 1:34:34.059
Just one hand, okay?

1:34:34.103 --> 1:34:36.061
Come on, there you go,
there you go!

1:34:36.975 --> 1:34:38.934
-Put it down!
-Okay, okay.

1:34:38.977 --> 1:34:41.197
Oh, the right hand come off!
You're my right hand.

1:34:41.240 --> 1:34:43.503
You might have to be
the right hand of a man.

1:34:43.547 --> 1:34:45.375
Okay, okay.

1:34:45.418 --> 1:34:51.903
[both laughing]

1:34:52.599 --> 1:34:54.558
[Ted whooping]

1:34:54.601 --> 1:34:59.171
[laughing]

1:35:15.579 --> 1:35:19.452
We are an anarchist group...

1:35:19.496 --> 1:35:24.066
...calling ourselves...

1:35:24.109 --> 1:35:26.764
Calling ourselves FC.
...FC.

1:35:26.808 --> 1:35:30.376
Notice that the postmark
on this envelope

1:35:30.420 --> 1:35:32.335
precedes a newsworthy event

1:35:32.378 --> 1:35:36.078
that will happen about the time
you receive this letter,

1:35:36.121 --> 1:35:38.123
if nothing goes wrong.

1:35:38.167 --> 1:35:43.781
We are getting tired

1:35:43.825 --> 1:35:48.264
of making bombs.

1:35:50.962 --> 1:35:54.444
It's no fun having to spend
all your evenings and weekends

1:35:54.487 --> 1:35:56.359
preparing dangerous mixtures,

1:35:56.402 --> 1:35:59.144
filing trigger mechanisms
out of scraps of metal

1:35:59.188 --> 1:36:01.016
or searching the Sierras
for a place

1:36:01.059 --> 1:36:03.018
isolated enough
to test the bomb.

1:36:03.061 --> 1:36:04.671
[explosion rumbling]

1:36:05.368 --> 1:36:07.370
So we offer a bargain.

1:36:08.458 --> 1:36:11.374
We have a long article
between 29,000

1:36:11.417 --> 1:36:14.856
and 37,000 words
that we want to have published.

1:36:14.899 --> 1:36:18.642
If you can get it published
according to our requirements,

1:36:18.685 --> 1:36:22.298
we will permanently desist
from terrorist activities.

1:36:22.341 --> 1:36:24.474
If the answer is satisfactory,

1:36:24.517 --> 1:36:26.868
we will finish typing
the manuscript and send

1:36:26.911 --> 1:36:29.609
it to you. If the answer
is unsatisfactory,

1:36:29.653 --> 1:36:31.568
we will start building
our next bomb.

1:36:31.611 --> 1:36:35.354
-[explosion rumbling]
-[objects clattering]

1:36:36.007 --> 1:36:37.443
FC.

1:36:38.531 --> 1:36:40.577
[chuckling]

1:37:41.638 --> 1:37:44.467
I am choked with frustration
at my inability to get

1:37:44.510 --> 1:37:47.731
my stinking fucking family
off my back once and for all.

1:37:48.427 --> 1:37:50.212
No, it does include you, David.

1:37:50.255 --> 1:37:51.648
It emphatically
and specifically

1:37:51.691 --> 1:37:53.606
includes you, yeah.

1:37:53.650 --> 1:37:56.261
Of course, you-- you're part
of my stinking fucking family.

1:37:56.305 --> 1:37:58.829
It's not an emotional decision.
It's a logical decision, David.

1:37:58.873 --> 1:38:01.353
It's logical.
Yeah, I have my own life.

1:38:01.397 --> 1:38:03.703
I have my own life, David,
I think my own thoughts

1:38:03.747 --> 1:38:05.836
and then I do what
I think I should do,

1:38:05.880 --> 1:38:07.229
as opposed to
what other people--

1:38:07.272 --> 1:38:08.665
Look, I'm not-- I'm not--

1:38:08.708 --> 1:38:10.580
I'm not gonna do this again.

1:38:10.623 --> 1:38:13.061
I'm not gonna do this again
with you, David. All right?

1:38:13.104 --> 1:38:15.585
I do not want to hear
from you or any member

1:38:15.628 --> 1:38:18.893
of my stinking
fucking family ever again.

1:38:19.589 --> 1:38:20.807
Goodbye.

1:38:42.133 --> 1:38:43.743
Hi.
[driver speaking indistinctly]

1:38:43.787 --> 1:38:45.049
Yeah, yeah.

1:39:07.028 --> 1:39:10.857
-This is CNN breaking news.

1:39:10.901 --> 1:39:12.947
-Hello from CNN News Center
in Atlanta,

1:39:12.990 --> 1:39:15.471
I'm Natalie Allen.
We're about to take live

1:39:15.514 --> 1:39:17.473
a news conference
from San Francisco

1:39:17.516 --> 1:39:20.345
headed up by the FBI today
concerning the bomb threat

1:39:20.389 --> 1:39:22.391
that has come in.
The person behind the threat

1:39:22.434 --> 1:39:24.697
may be the so-called Unabomber,

1:39:24.741 --> 1:39:27.222
and the threat has resulted
in heightened security

1:39:27.265 --> 1:39:29.746
at five airports in--

1:39:29.789 --> 1:39:33.054
Small debris,
big debris, dust--

1:39:33.097 --> 1:39:35.752
I'm relieved to
see a lot of security around--

1:39:35.795 --> 1:39:37.841
...and determination?

1:39:37.884 --> 1:39:40.191
-Well, our position is we will
keep the security measures

1:39:40.235 --> 1:39:42.977
in place until
the matter is resolved.

1:39:43.020 --> 1:39:44.761
It's been more
than five days since

1:39:44.804 --> 1:39:47.198
the Unabomber threatened
to blow up an airliner

1:39:47.242 --> 1:39:50.680
flying in or out
of Los Angeles by July 4th.

1:39:50.723 --> 1:39:54.510
But after 17 years,
23 injuries and three deaths,

1:39:54.553 --> 1:39:57.469
the Unabomber
is nothing to joke about.

1:39:57.513 --> 1:40:00.429
Experts say the Unabomber
is stepping up his activities

1:40:00.472 --> 1:40:02.431
because he's jealous
of the attention given

1:40:02.474 --> 1:40:04.433
to the Oklahoma City bombing

1:40:04.476 --> 1:40:06.043
which stole the thunder

1:40:06.087 --> 1:40:07.697
from his last
package bomb explosion.

1:40:07.740 --> 1:40:09.873
Experts also believe
the Unabomber

1:40:09.916 --> 1:40:11.875
may be headed for a fall.

1:40:11.918 --> 1:40:14.051
I think he's on a high now.

1:40:14.095 --> 1:40:16.184
I think he's all pumped up.

1:40:16.227 --> 1:40:18.708
I think he's intoxicated
with his own power,

1:40:18.751 --> 1:40:21.537
and I think at this point,
he's most vulnerable.

1:40:21.580 --> 1:40:23.582
[indistinct]

1:40:23.626 --> 1:40:25.802
I think he might
have made some major mistakes.

1:41:01.794 --> 1:41:03.883
The FBI is unable to catch him,

1:41:03.927 --> 1:41:06.234
and now the Unabomber
has raised the stakes again.

1:41:06.277 --> 1:41:08.540
In the letter sent
to The Washington Post

1:41:08.584 --> 1:41:10.760
and the New York Times this
week, the Unabomber has pledged

1:41:10.803 --> 1:41:12.936
to stop his murderous spree
if these leading American papers

1:41:12.979 --> 1:41:15.243
will publish
a 35,000-word manifesto.

1:41:15.286 --> 1:41:18.246
In the document the Unabomber
condemns modern technology

1:41:18.289 --> 1:41:20.335
and says computers have
created a world in which humans

1:41:20.378 --> 1:41:23.381
are mere cogs in the machine.
That proposal has led to a life

1:41:23.425 --> 1:41:25.949
or death question
for The Post and

1:41:25.992 --> 1:41:28.299
should they cave in to threats
and publish, or refuse

1:41:28.343 --> 1:41:30.171
to let themselves be
used as a platform--

1:41:30.214 --> 1:41:33.913
In paragraph 125,
we use an analogy of a weak

1:41:33.957 --> 1:41:37.482
neighbor who was left destitute
by a strong neighbor who takes

1:41:37.526 --> 1:41:41.182
all his land by forcing on
him a series of compromises.

1:41:41.225 --> 1:41:44.881
But suppose now that
the strong neighbor gets sick

1:41:44.924 --> 1:41:47.318
so that he is unable
to defend himself.

1:41:47.362 --> 1:41:50.147
The weak neighbor
can force the strong one

1:41:50.191 --> 1:41:52.802
to give him his land back
or he can kill him.

1:41:52.845 --> 1:41:56.066
If he lets the strong man
survive and only forces him

1:41:56.110 --> 1:41:58.242
to give his land back,
he is a fool,

1:41:58.286 --> 1:42:01.289
because when the strong man gets
well, he will again take all

1:42:01.332 --> 1:42:03.204
the land for himself.

1:42:03.247 --> 1:42:05.554
The only sensible alternative
for the weaker man is to kill

1:42:05.597 --> 1:42:08.818
a strong one while he has
the chance. In the same way,

1:42:08.861 --> 1:42:10.776
while the industrial
system is sick,

1:42:10.820 --> 1:42:13.953
we must destroy it.
If we compromise with it

1:42:13.997 --> 1:42:15.781
and let it recover
from its sickness,

1:42:15.825 --> 1:42:17.696
it will eventually wipe
out all of our freedom.

1:42:18.523 --> 1:42:20.699
We're back
at CNN in Washington--

1:42:21.265 --> 1:42:23.093
We hear somebody yelling,
"It ain't gonna happen."

1:42:26.401 --> 1:42:29.317
Trying to catch back up
to O.J. Simpson heading past

1:42:29.360 --> 1:42:32.581
LAX on the 405 freeway north.

1:42:34.235 --> 1:42:36.541
Again, you see traffic
in the South lanes stopping

1:42:36.585 --> 1:42:38.587
and looking,
police cars trailing,

1:42:38.630 --> 1:42:41.677
other traffic, stopping off to
the right.

1:42:47.073 --> 1:42:49.424
[indistinct chatter]

1:42:56.518 --> 1:42:58.433
Hey, Gilbert,
you should take this,

1:42:58.476 --> 1:43:00.522
even though it isn't for you.
-Maybe it's a bomb.

1:43:00.565 --> 1:43:02.219
You should send
that off to Bill.

1:43:02.263 --> 1:43:03.916
Maybe it's a love letter.

1:43:03.960 --> 1:43:06.876
Oh, it's Oklahoma City.
Oh, be careful.

1:43:18.192 --> 1:43:20.977
This Postal
Service circulates a special

1:43:21.020 --> 1:43:23.458
training tape illustrating
detection techniques.

1:43:23.501 --> 1:43:26.025
It also graphically
demonstrates the power

1:43:26.069 --> 1:43:29.377
of a mail bomb by use
of a dummy in a mock-up office.

1:43:29.420 --> 1:43:31.553
He's matching
wits, he's matching wits

1:43:31.596 --> 1:43:33.946
with everybody who comes
into conflict with him.

1:43:33.990 --> 1:43:36.253
This is the arena.
This is the Coliseum.

1:43:36.297 --> 1:43:38.647
"It's me against the lion."

1:43:38.690 --> 1:43:41.127
Add to this
the letter received

1:43:41.171 --> 1:43:44.043
by The New York Times, a letter
sent before the latest bombings.

1:43:44.087 --> 1:43:47.525
It warned of a newsworthy
event and claimed responsibility

1:43:47.569 --> 1:43:50.876
in the name of an anarchist
group calling itself FC.

1:43:50.920 --> 1:43:52.748
We don't have
a shred of evidence

1:43:52.791 --> 1:43:54.880
that he's connected
with any other people.

1:43:54.924 --> 1:43:58.101
The FBI says
it's up to The New York Times,

1:43:58.144 --> 1:43:59.929
whether they comply
with the Unabomber's

1:43:59.972 --> 1:44:01.713
demand to publish
a long-written piece.

1:44:01.757 --> 1:44:04.673
But the FBI seems
to doubt the sincerity

1:44:04.716 --> 1:44:06.370
of the Unabomber's offer.

1:44:06.414 --> 1:44:08.242
That's because,
in the same letter,

1:44:08.285 --> 1:44:10.722
he reserves the right
to engage in sabotage

1:44:10.766 --> 1:44:14.160
intended to damage
property instead of humans.

1:44:14.204 --> 1:44:17.468

1:45:51.432 --> 1:45:54.478
[birds chirping]

1:46:10.755 --> 1:46:12.627
This morning in Washington,

1:46:12.670 --> 1:46:15.194
the news dominating
street corner conversation

1:46:15.238 --> 1:46:18.110
was what was on the front page
of this morning's paper.

1:46:18.154 --> 1:46:21.462
The Washington Post
had published a special section

1:46:21.505 --> 1:46:24.421
containing the
35,000-word manifesto

1:46:24.465 --> 1:46:27.381
of the serial mail bomber
known as Unabomber.

1:46:27.424 --> 1:46:30.035
The post cited quote,
"Public safety reasons"

1:46:30.079 --> 1:46:32.821
for its decision,
taken and paid for jointly

1:46:32.864 --> 1:46:34.779
with The New York Times.

1:46:34.823 --> 1:46:37.956
In an unusual joint statement,
publishers Donald Graham

1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:40.481
of The Post
and Arthur Sulzberger Jr.

1:46:40.524 --> 1:46:43.048
of the Times justified
publication.

1:46:43.092 --> 1:46:46.182
Quote, "If we fail
to do so, the Unabomber--"

1:46:48.010 --> 1:46:49.707
[laughing]

1:47:04.200 --> 1:47:07.943
-Yeah! Yeah!

1:47:12.295 --> 1:47:14.428
[laughing]

1:47:18.954 --> 1:47:20.912
Unfortunately,
for attorney general and the FBI

1:47:20.956 --> 1:47:23.785
have all surrendered
authority to the Unabomber.

1:47:23.828 --> 1:47:27.266
I can see this fellow
who has to be right now

1:47:27.310 --> 1:47:30.139
having a psychological orgasm.

1:47:30.182 --> 1:47:33.185
They've elevated him
to controlling,

1:47:33.229 --> 1:47:37.102
like a puppeteer, cities,
newspapers and everything else.

1:47:37.146 --> 1:47:39.191
Where does it go from here?

1:47:39.235 --> 1:47:41.585
It's difficult
to argue with his logic.

1:47:41.629 --> 1:47:43.761
You can bet that neither
The New York Times

1:47:43.805 --> 1:47:46.416
nor The Washington Post
would have published his essay

1:47:46.460 --> 1:47:49.288
absent his track record
as a murderer

1:47:49.332 --> 1:47:51.639
and his, therefore,
totally credible threat

1:47:51.682 --> 1:47:53.075
that he would kill again.

killers derive the whole

"of their satisfaction

"In your case,
I suggested that killing

Hey, can you come
to show us your boundary?

1:55:41.325 --> 1:55:43.545
We're trying to figure it out
where your property line ends.

1:55:55.949 --> 1:55:58.647
-Morning, Ted.
-Morning.

1:55:58.690 --> 1:56:00.910
-This is Bob and Mike.
They're miners.

1:56:02.390 --> 1:56:04.740
-Good morning, Mr. Kaczynski.

1:56:04.783 --> 1:56:08.309
We've been doing a little mining
in the area and, well, we just

1:56:08.352 --> 1:56:12.226
got a little bit confused about
where your property line ends.

1:56:17.057 --> 1:56:19.755
And we were hoping
that you could show us

1:56:19.798 --> 1:56:22.018
exactly where this line is.

1:56:25.674 --> 1:56:27.763
-Yeah. Yeah, no. All right,

1:56:27.806 --> 1:56:29.983
let me just get my jacket--

1:56:30.026 --> 1:56:31.680
Get your fucking hands off me!

1:56:32.898 --> 1:56:34.988
Get your fucking
hands off of me!

Get your fucking
hands off of me!

-Mr. Kaczynski, we are the FBI.

1:56:41.646 --> 1:56:44.780
We have a warrant
to search your cabin.

...we're told
by federal law enforcement

1:58:10.866 --> 1:58:14.391
officials is that they received
a tip on this person indirectly

1:58:14.435 --> 1:58:16.480
from a family member.

1:58:16.524 --> 1:58:19.309
This man's brother contacted
a prominent Washington D.C.

1:58:19.353 --> 1:58:22.399
lawyer, who in turn
got in touch with the FBI

1:58:22.443 --> 1:58:24.488
and told them about this person,
and they've had him under

1:58:24.532 --> 1:58:27.187
surveillance now for about
a week or so, we're told.

1:58:27.230 --> 1:58:30.015
They are preparing right now
to serve a search warrant,

1:58:30.059 --> 1:58:32.583
or probably in the process
of serving it now.

1:58:32.627 --> 1:58:35.151
We don't know whether this
person is at home,

1:58:35.195 --> 1:58:37.110
or what they expect
to find there.

1:58:37.153 --> 1:58:38.937
If they're just going to
find evidence that they would

1:58:38.981 --> 1:58:40.852
take from the house,
possible evidence,

1:58:40.896 --> 1:58:42.854
or whether they're actually
going to find something.

1:58:42.898 --> 1:58:44.682
We don't know whether there's
been any arrest yet...
