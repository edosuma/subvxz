00:55.000 --> 00:58.070
Hey.

00:58.110 --> 00:59.280
Are you mine?

01:01.580 --> 01:03.080
Please be mine.

01:22.030 --> 01:27.970
Hey, I'm Bryan, and
you are Rufus.

01:39.050 --> 01:40.390
Hey, Rufus, wait!

01:41.620 --> 01:43.150
Rufus, wait!

01:48.290 --> 01:49.890
Rufus, wait! Rufus!

01:51.960 --> 01:53.130
Rufus?

01:56.500 --> 01:58.000
Rufus?

01:58.070 --> 02:00.340
Come on. Where'd you go?

02:04.410 --> 02:06.050
Who's there?

02:06.140 --> 02:07.910
Who's out there?

02:10.310 --> 02:11.310
Rufus?

02:25.660 --> 02:26.890
Oh, my God.

02:29.170 --> 02:30.270
Rufus?

02:54.720 --> 02:56.420
Eve, you shouldn't have done it.

02:56.530 --> 02:57.430
You have a group of parents
petitioning

02:57.530 --> 02:58.800
to have you fired now.

02:58.860 --> 03:00.460
I know who.
They've been trying

03:00.530 --> 03:01.810
to get me fired since I started.

03:01.870 --> 03:02.876
And sometimes it seems like

03:02.900 --> 03:03.900
you want them to succeed.

03:03.970 --> 03:06.970
Maine state law requires
sexual education.

03:07.040 --> 03:08.980
But local boards decide
which topics.

03:09.040 --> 03:10.640
And the topics
they don't want covered,

03:10.710 --> 03:13.110
do we imagine they just
disappear if we ignore them?

03:13.210 --> 03:15.580
I may personally agree with
you, but when you teach topics

03:15.650 --> 03:16.930
that aren't covered
by the board,

03:16.980 --> 03:18.820
you're telling them about stuff

03:18.880 --> 03:20.226
that we've decided they're
too young to know about.

03:20.250 --> 03:22.390
These kids know how to Google.

03:22.420 --> 03:24.490
And some people believe
that such information

03:24.550 --> 03:26.750
will lead to them having sex.

03:29.260 --> 03:32.830
I hope they don't, but
I know they will.

03:32.900 --> 03:33.830
There's a difference.

03:33.900 --> 03:35.430
I know.

03:37.770 --> 03:39.740
Nevertheless,
the board has decided

03:39.770 --> 03:41.610
to place you
on administrative leave.

03:44.070 --> 03:46.740
There'll be an official
announcement tomorrow.

03:51.680 --> 03:53.520
We'll figure it out.

03:53.580 --> 03:55.820
You tell Alex?
Yeah.

03:55.920 --> 03:57.620
She wasn't exactly surprised.

04:01.860 --> 04:03.160
I'm sorry.

04:03.260 --> 04:04.460
Don't be.

04:04.530 --> 04:06.940
Even if I resign, the other
schools will know why.

04:06.960 --> 04:08.200
I won't get a new job.

04:11.300 --> 04:12.800
I could go to work
for the paper.

04:12.870 --> 04:15.870
You already work too much.

04:17.440 --> 04:18.510
We could move.

04:20.110 --> 04:21.480
You'd do that for me?

04:21.540 --> 04:23.840
I'd do anything for you.

04:25.050 --> 04:26.050
You love it here.

04:28.620 --> 04:30.190
It is pretty.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.860
Not if you look closely.

04:44.130 --> 04:45.870
You coming?

04:47.470 --> 04:48.370
Hey, Nathalie.

04:48.470 --> 04:50.210
Mind giving our garden

04:50.310 --> 04:51.810
the same treatment
while we're away?

04:51.840 --> 04:53.810
If you take your bikes
instead of the car.

04:53.840 --> 04:56.140
You know, I saw at the library

04:56.180 --> 04:58.650
that it's the short trips
that pollute the most.

04:58.680 --> 05:00.050
Hope you didn't drive there.

05:00.150 --> 05:02.850
Dad, we have to go.

05:02.920 --> 05:06.560
Sorry, Nathalie.
Messy garden, it is.

05:12.160 --> 05:15.330
So, uh, Alex,
any particular reason

05:15.370 --> 05:17.870
for your newfound interest
in high school football?

05:17.930 --> 05:20.400
Is it a fascination
with team psychology,

05:20.500 --> 05:22.240
or are you making a study
of the celebration

05:22.340 --> 05:24.010
of the athlete
as modern gladiator?

05:24.040 --> 05:25.680
- Yes, Dad.
- Which one?

05:25.710 --> 05:27.350
The gladiator one.

05:27.380 --> 05:29.580
Oh, yes, 'cause I...
I don't know.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.156
I had a feeling
it might have something to do

05:31.180 --> 05:32.756
with the piercing blue eyes
of Jay Heisel,

05:32.780 --> 05:33.820
the superstar quarterback.

05:33.850 --> 05:35.350
Dad.

05:35.390 --> 05:37.530
- To which I would say...
- I'm not interested.

05:37.550 --> 05:39.050
To which I would say,

05:39.120 --> 05:41.190
there's more to life
than good looks.

05:42.860 --> 05:43.860
I know.

05:45.030 --> 05:46.630
Adrian meeting us there?

05:46.700 --> 05:47.900
If they let him.

05:56.040 --> 05:59.310
I'm done now.
Can I, uh, leave?

05:59.380 --> 06:01.320
I'm meeting Alex at the game.

06:09.390 --> 06:11.060
Can I leave?

06:24.170 --> 06:25.546
You know your father
can't hear you

06:25.570 --> 06:27.170
when you're wearing makeup.

06:45.920 --> 06:47.660
All football is
is white male aggression.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.330
3/4 of the NFL is black.

06:49.430 --> 06:51.030
Well, maybe they're oppressed,

06:51.090 --> 06:53.076
and this is their way out
of a bankrupt education system.

06:53.100 --> 06:54.600
But maybe they like football.

06:54.630 --> 06:56.970
Maybe you can be oppressed
and still like football.

06:57.030 --> 06:59.030
Either way, I'm gonna enjoy
my male privilege

06:59.100 --> 07:00.370
and stare at their bodies.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.550
Is that one of the moms
that got you fired?

07:21.960 --> 07:24.000
Okay, Mia, tell me where it is.

07:24.060 --> 07:27.560
Tell me where it is!

07:27.630 --> 07:31.370
You goddamn junkie.

07:33.340 --> 07:35.380
I don't know what you're
talking about.

07:35.470 --> 07:38.210
Rob told me
I can do whatever I want to you,

07:38.310 --> 07:40.010
as long as I make you talk.

07:40.080 --> 07:41.420
Huh?

07:41.480 --> 07:44.050
Well, maybe that's why
Rob is dead now.

07:44.150 --> 07:45.550
That's bullshit.

07:50.320 --> 07:52.160
Well, why don't you call him?

07:54.020 --> 07:55.020
Shit.

08:00.760 --> 08:03.560
Yeah, it's me. Where's Rob?

08:03.670 --> 08:05.740
Ohh!

09:01.590 --> 09:03.290
Think your boy's
gonna get lucky tonight.

09:03.390 --> 09:05.430
Not luck. Worked for it.

09:06.660 --> 09:07.730
Hey, Uncle Mike.

09:09.170 --> 09:10.240
Hey, Connor.

09:10.270 --> 09:11.770
Kid sure can throw a ball.

09:11.830 --> 09:13.900
Eh, raised him to be a man.

09:13.940 --> 09:15.910
Don't think my brother
knows what a man is.

09:18.410 --> 09:21.980
Dad.
What?

09:22.080 --> 09:23.726
Team wants to celebrate
tonight at Kristofferson's.

09:23.750 --> 09:25.920
Go. You deserve it.

09:26.950 --> 09:27.950
Do you wanna come?

09:29.590 --> 09:36.960
Alex is not old enough
for a party.

09:37.030 --> 09:38.130
Uh...

09:43.930 --> 09:45.530
Maybe we could have
discussed it first.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.100
Every time we discuss something,

09:47.140 --> 09:48.540
you give her
just enough vague hope

09:48.610 --> 09:50.116
to make it even more painful
when I say no.

09:50.140 --> 09:51.610
Maybe you
shouldn't say no, then.

09:51.640 --> 09:53.610
I wish you would do it,
but you don't.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.400
You say maybe
and leave the dirty work to me.

09:55.450 --> 09:57.490
Okay. Yes.

09:57.550 --> 09:58.480
Yes, what?

09:58.550 --> 09:59.480
Yes, she can go.

09:59.550 --> 10:00.950
She's almost 17.

10:00.980 --> 10:02.550
Which still makes her 16.

10:02.620 --> 10:05.360
She has to get out
and experience life.

10:07.290 --> 10:08.990
It's time to let her go.

10:10.890 --> 10:12.460
She'll be fine.

10:23.740 --> 10:25.340
She just wants
what's best for you.

10:25.410 --> 10:28.550
Do you also think
this is what's best for me?

10:31.680 --> 10:32.650
She loves you.

10:32.680 --> 10:34.720
She has no idea what love is.

10:34.820 --> 10:35.920
Hey.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.760
Her love is different.

10:40.820 --> 10:42.320
It's... It's nuanced. It's rich.

10:42.360 --> 10:45.100
She doesn't understand
our kind of love.

10:45.160 --> 10:47.230
Doesn't mean she loves any less.

10:53.670 --> 10:55.840
Wait till your mom is asleep.

10:55.870 --> 10:57.740
If you can get Adrian
to go with you...

10:59.040 --> 11:00.540
you can go
for a couple of hours.

11:03.050 --> 11:05.020
No drinking.

11:05.050 --> 11:06.890
Back by midnight. Okay?

11:12.360 --> 11:14.560
Pretty nice of your dad
to let you go.

11:14.620 --> 11:16.120
Very nice of you to join me.

11:16.190 --> 11:17.730
Oh, yeah, I'm the best.

11:17.790 --> 11:19.960
And your dad was okay?

11:20.030 --> 11:21.506
What's the point
of asking permission

11:21.530 --> 11:22.800
if he won't even talk to you?

11:22.870 --> 11:25.310
- Still?
- Two weeks and counting.

11:25.370 --> 11:27.240
Not that I miss him
calling me a freak.

11:27.300 --> 11:29.870
I think you should
just move in with us

11:29.910 --> 11:31.210
and we could adopt you.

11:31.240 --> 11:33.040
Oh, like a little shelter puppy.

11:33.080 --> 11:35.650
Yeah, then we can watch cheesy
eighties movies every night.

11:35.710 --> 11:38.650
Yeah, I'm sure Kevin and Eve
would love that.

11:38.720 --> 11:39.920
Yeah, of course they would.

11:39.980 --> 11:43.960
Mom's always 30% less
annoying when you're around.

11:44.050 --> 11:45.620
They'd love it.
I'd love it.

11:48.560 --> 11:51.130
And you are aware that pretty
much all of these people

11:51.230 --> 11:52.730
are superficial assholes.

11:52.760 --> 11:53.930
No, they're not.

11:55.270 --> 11:56.800
Look...

11:56.900 --> 11:59.740
I promise I will follow you
wherever you want to go

11:59.770 --> 12:01.940
when you fall in love
with a guy, okay?

12:02.010 --> 12:04.450
Or a girl.
I don't fall for gender.

12:04.510 --> 12:07.980
I fall for per...
Personality. Sure. Come on.

12:09.080 --> 12:10.420
Ohh.

12:20.460 --> 12:22.200
Hey.

12:22.260 --> 12:23.660
I... I don't drink.

12:23.760 --> 12:25.200
That's, like, totally offensive

12:25.260 --> 12:26.260
to the local culture.

12:26.300 --> 12:28.770
We can't be offensive.

12:31.630 --> 12:32.800
Well, that was nice.

12:32.870 --> 12:34.970
Thank you. What now?

12:35.040 --> 12:38.610
I don't know. We dance?

12:38.640 --> 12:39.640
Sure.

12:54.390 --> 12:56.730
What's the faggot doing here?

12:56.790 --> 13:00.030
I am here to hook up
with hot football jocks.

13:00.130 --> 13:01.800
- You.
- Oh?

13:01.830 --> 13:03.970
I thought you were a bottom.
Yeah?

13:04.000 --> 13:05.216
- Yeah.
- That's what you thought?

13:05.240 --> 13:06.370
Let him go.

13:06.470 --> 13:08.240
Hey.
What's going on?

13:09.640 --> 13:12.140
We were just having fun.

13:12.180 --> 13:13.820
Doesn't look
like he's having fun.

13:20.420 --> 13:22.190
I'm sorry for my friends.

13:22.250 --> 13:23.966
Apparently they forgot
what century we live in.

13:23.990 --> 13:26.360
Yeah. It's okay.

13:29.160 --> 13:30.660
I'm glad you came.

13:30.690 --> 13:32.590
I'm sorry about this.

13:32.660 --> 13:34.260
Let me get you guys a drink.

13:34.330 --> 13:36.870
I don't drink.

13:38.270 --> 13:39.700
Well, then if nothing else,

13:39.770 --> 13:42.210
then just to shake off
this whole experience.

13:42.270 --> 13:43.770
Okay?

13:45.280 --> 13:46.510
Okay.

13:48.880 --> 13:50.550
But just one.

14:05.360 --> 14:07.360
God, you're such a pussy.

14:07.400 --> 14:08.700
You know that right?

14:08.730 --> 14:10.176
Want me to come
and arrest it for you?

14:10.200 --> 14:11.230
You.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.370
Something killed my dog.

14:15.410 --> 14:16.950
It killed my... dog,

14:17.040 --> 14:19.210
a-a-and there was,
uh, something in the mist.

14:19.240 --> 14:22.110
It's... It's on its way.
We... We gotta warn 'em.

14:22.210 --> 14:23.480
Calm down, soldier.

14:23.550 --> 14:25.320
Don't tell me
to calm down. Okay?

14:25.380 --> 14:27.450
I-I'm telling you
there was something in the mist.

14:27.550 --> 14:29.626
Do you not understand that?
There was something in it.

14:29.650 --> 14:30.950
Okay. Okay.

14:31.050 --> 14:32.280
Now can you tell us,

14:32.390 --> 14:33.830
have you done any drugs lately?

14:33.890 --> 14:35.730
I'm not doing any drugs, man.
What the...?

14:35.760 --> 14:36.966
Okay, I'm telling you,
something...

14:36.990 --> 14:38.790
Something killed your dog, yeah.

14:38.900 --> 14:40.376
Listen, you can't go around
spreading fear like that.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.300
It disrupts
the public order, okay?

14:42.400 --> 14:43.876
Maybe you might
want to stay around here

14:43.900 --> 14:45.640
until you sober up again.

14:45.740 --> 14:46.640
We gotta get guns.

14:46.740 --> 14:49.110
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:49.170 --> 14:50.940
- Get the door!
- Ahh! Get off!

14:51.010 --> 14:52.850
Ahh! Get off me.

14:52.910 --> 14:54.350
- Stay down!
- No.

14:54.410 --> 14:56.280
I'm telling you... Ahh!
It's coming!

14:58.280 --> 14:59.780
You don't understand.

14:59.850 --> 15:02.290
I-It's coming.

15:02.350 --> 15:03.350
It's coming!

16:04.870 --> 16:06.470
Hey.

16:06.510 --> 16:07.280
What are you doing here?

16:07.340 --> 16:08.940
Who are you?

16:09.010 --> 16:12.850
Um, where is Mrs. Lambert?

16:12.880 --> 16:15.220
The old lady?
She died two months ago.

16:15.320 --> 16:16.560
I live here now.

16:16.650 --> 16:20.020
I, uh...
I didn't know. Um...

16:22.020 --> 16:25.720
I left some things in the shed.
If I could...

16:25.830 --> 16:27.700
Her stuff's
in a storage locker downtown.

16:27.730 --> 16:30.630
They couldn't find her daughter.

16:30.700 --> 16:33.040
Who'd you say you were?

16:33.070 --> 16:36.010
Just, uh, an old friend.

16:36.040 --> 16:38.310
Just an old friend?

16:38.370 --> 16:41.170
Yeah, well, there was nothing
of value in the garden shed,

16:41.210 --> 16:44.010
just some old furniture.
You want that,

16:44.040 --> 16:46.240
you'll have to take it up
with the estate lawyer.

17:19.280 --> 17:20.579
Alex.

17:24.390 --> 17:25.260
What is it?

17:25.290 --> 17:26.790
- Uh...
- Where is she?

17:26.890 --> 17:28.860
I don't know.
Maybe... Maybe she's, uh...

17:46.440 --> 17:49.780
Sweetie, you have
to tell us what happened.

17:49.810 --> 17:52.210
We can't help you
unless you tell us.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.320
I went to the party...
What?

17:54.420 --> 17:59.060
And I got drunk, very drunk.

17:59.120 --> 18:03.760
The last thing I remember is
someone helping me upstairs...

18:03.790 --> 18:06.630
Alex.
And I blacked out.

18:06.660 --> 18:08.900
Alex, I told you not to drink.

18:08.960 --> 18:10.660
You went to the party?

18:10.760 --> 18:13.500
I told her she could go.
What are you talking about?

18:13.600 --> 18:15.800
I told her she could go
if she brought Adrian along.

18:15.840 --> 18:17.110
Who allowed you to do that?

18:17.140 --> 18:18.280
I allowed it.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.180
It's okay, sweetie.

18:24.280 --> 18:26.080
You're home now.
That's what matters.

18:30.180 --> 18:31.920
Alex?
What's wrong?

18:33.820 --> 18:36.460
When I woke up, my...

18:36.490 --> 18:40.130
I could feel what had happened.

18:42.200 --> 18:44.800
There was blood on the sheets.

18:50.040 --> 18:51.210
I'm s-sorry.

18:51.310 --> 18:52.640
I shouldn't have gone.

18:54.840 --> 18:57.110
This can never be your fault.

18:57.180 --> 19:00.180
Alex.

19:04.180 --> 19:06.450
Adrian knows what happened.

19:09.660 --> 19:12.700
He says it was... Jay.

19:16.230 --> 19:19.670
We have to take her
to the police.

19:22.700 --> 19:25.570
Alex, honey... we should go now.

19:31.380 --> 19:33.550
Eve, I'm...
You went behind my back.

19:33.580 --> 19:35.350
Yes, because you...

19:35.380 --> 19:38.550
You're keeping her locked up.
I have my reasons.

19:40.050 --> 19:42.150
We can't fight right now.

19:42.220 --> 19:43.340
We have to be there for her.

19:46.060 --> 19:48.430
Then don't talk to me.

20:05.710 --> 20:08.250
Well, looks like
you have calmed down a bit.

20:09.950 --> 20:11.420
Why don't you tell me
who you are?

20:11.450 --> 20:13.390
I'll file a report.
We can all go home.

20:13.420 --> 20:14.860
What's your name?

20:14.920 --> 20:18.930
I, uh... Bryan Hunt.

20:20.390 --> 20:21.390
And where do you live?

20:23.260 --> 20:27.300
I don't, uh... I'm homeless.

20:28.470 --> 20:30.810
Ahem. Social Security number?

20:34.110 --> 20:35.750
I don't remember.

20:37.240 --> 20:38.980
Look, please, just listen to me.

20:39.080 --> 20:40.420
Hey! Hey!

20:40.450 --> 20:41.820
- You can't do that!
- Oh, yeah?

20:41.920 --> 20:43.390
You can remember the law, huh?

20:43.450 --> 20:45.550
Well, it looks like
we are calling Arrowhead,

20:45.620 --> 20:48.120
and you are staying
a while longer.

20:48.160 --> 20:49.330
Get me prints on that weirdo.

20:49.420 --> 20:50.420
Please.

20:51.460 --> 20:53.660
Okay.

20:53.760 --> 20:54.890
Heh.

20:58.470 --> 21:00.340
Kevin?

21:00.430 --> 21:01.930
What can I do for you?

21:01.970 --> 21:04.270
Maybe it's best
we speak to someone else.

21:10.980 --> 21:12.620
Hey, Jay.

21:12.650 --> 21:14.290
We need you to come with us.

21:14.310 --> 21:15.850
Why? What's going on?

21:20.790 --> 21:22.436
We just need you
to come down to the station

21:22.460 --> 21:23.760
and answer a few questions.

21:24.990 --> 21:25.990
About what?

21:28.160 --> 21:30.430
You're being investigated
for sexual assault.

21:30.500 --> 21:32.040
Yeah.

21:33.970 --> 21:35.370
C'mon.

22:22.520 --> 22:24.390
Did you see that?

22:24.420 --> 22:28.380
And the toads... Huh.
Probably a small earthquake.

22:52.550 --> 22:54.056
The police had
a few more questions for her,

22:54.080 --> 22:55.880
and then you can go home.

22:55.920 --> 22:58.760
She should see a therapist
as soon as possible.

22:58.790 --> 23:00.960
From you,
she needs stability, safety...

23:07.900 --> 23:09.900
Kevin, I can't say anything.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.810
- I need to know.
- It's a police investigation.

23:13.900 --> 23:17.370
There are signs of intercourse,
but no violence.

23:17.440 --> 23:20.380
There were also traces
of Triazolam in her blood.

23:20.440 --> 23:22.210
She was passed out.

23:22.280 --> 23:23.916
What about the DNA?
Can't you... shouldn't you, um...

23:23.940 --> 23:25.810
We took one,
and that will show who,

23:25.910 --> 23:27.380
but not that it was rape.

23:29.280 --> 23:30.950
There's a witness, right?

23:42.600 --> 23:45.000
I don't know what to do.

23:45.100 --> 23:46.770
I wanted to listen
to some music,

23:46.800 --> 23:48.240
and I need to pick a song.

23:48.300 --> 23:50.670
I was like, the song I pick,

23:50.770 --> 23:53.910
it'll always be
the first song I heard after...

23:55.810 --> 23:59.350
Mm, we can choose
a really bad song?

23:59.450 --> 24:03.320
Like a stupid Katy Perry song
or something.

24:03.350 --> 24:05.990
That way,
you won't ruin a good song.

24:06.020 --> 24:07.460
I like Katy Perry.

24:07.490 --> 24:09.290
You hate her.

24:09.320 --> 24:11.020
Right.

24:11.130 --> 24:13.500
But thanks.

24:17.330 --> 24:19.500
You know how this is gonna go.

24:19.530 --> 24:21.970
Everyone loves Jay.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.040
They'll say you're a liar
and that it's your fault.

24:26.140 --> 24:28.140
Who are "they"?

24:28.180 --> 24:31.720
The whole town.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.180
I shouldn't have
gone behind your back.

24:40.390 --> 24:42.230
Do you have any idea
what it's like

24:42.320 --> 24:45.020
having been bad cop
for 16 years?

24:45.060 --> 24:47.860
16 years of me saying no.

24:47.900 --> 24:51.300
16 years of a daughter
who loves you and who hates...

24:58.840 --> 25:00.340
Jesus.

25:11.050 --> 25:13.650
Get back in. Get back in!

25:23.290 --> 25:23.890
If they haven't pressed charges,

25:23.990 --> 25:26.890
it means the case is weak.

25:26.990 --> 25:29.360
You're not going to jail.

25:29.460 --> 25:31.530
I guarantee that.

25:31.630 --> 25:32.660
You hear me?

25:35.830 --> 25:38.070
Why do you talk to me
as if I did it?

26:49.740 --> 26:51.380
I thought I told you
to get out of here.

26:52.610 --> 26:55.610
Just let me... This
is private property.

26:55.710 --> 26:56.740
Oh, no!

27:04.390 --> 27:06.130
Oh, what's the matter?

27:06.220 --> 27:07.960
You afraid of the cops?

27:08.060 --> 27:09.406
Maybe you should have
thought of that

27:09.430 --> 27:11.600
before you tried
to steal whatever this is.

27:11.630 --> 27:12.730
Don't.

27:15.230 --> 27:17.500
Holy...

27:41.430 --> 27:43.370
I'm not sorry.

27:43.460 --> 27:44.790
Down on the ground!

28:03.180 --> 28:05.380
What are you doing?

28:05.480 --> 28:06.610
Alex is not safe here.

28:06.650 --> 28:08.220
We're staying at my sister's.

28:10.990 --> 28:13.360
What if she needs help?

28:13.460 --> 28:15.500
I'll find a therapist
in St. Vincent,

28:15.530 --> 28:17.570
and Dr. Sing phoned in
a prescription for Valium.

28:17.660 --> 28:19.130
I'll pick it up.

28:20.830 --> 28:23.400
Okay. I'll pack some things.

28:23.500 --> 28:24.500
You're staying here.

28:28.040 --> 28:31.240
Eve, it was a party.

28:31.340 --> 28:32.910
There's no way
I could have known...

28:33.010 --> 28:35.080
But I could,
which is why I said no.

28:35.180 --> 28:37.520
How could you have known?

28:37.550 --> 28:39.690
Because I've spent
my entire life

28:39.720 --> 28:41.190
around guys like Jay.

28:44.360 --> 28:47.200
I can't be with you
right now, okay?

28:47.220 --> 28:50.590
Come up in a few days.
Then we'll talk.

28:50.700 --> 28:52.540
You should get the window fixed,

28:52.560 --> 28:54.730
and then go to the police
with the harassment.

29:06.880 --> 29:08.726
Sweetie, I thought we agreed
you'd stop looking

29:08.750 --> 29:11.090
for conspiracy theories
on the Internet.

29:11.180 --> 29:13.950
You know Dr. Kleerick
says it's not good for you.

29:14.050 --> 29:15.350
This is not the Internet.

29:15.390 --> 29:16.760
It's the "Bridgeville Post."

29:16.850 --> 29:18.120
I'm fine.

29:18.220 --> 29:20.260
Huh.

29:20.360 --> 29:24.400
"Six people were found dead,
presumably killed by a bear."

29:26.060 --> 29:29.400
"Other animals came down
the mountain in large numbers,

29:29.430 --> 29:32.770
including moose
and deer and foxes."

29:32.870 --> 29:34.310
No frogs, though.

29:34.410 --> 29:37.580
"Some locals fear
it's a black spring.

29:37.610 --> 29:41.480
"The legend of nature
turning sour is evidenced

29:41.580 --> 29:45.720
by the frozen lake being black
like a rotten tooth."

29:45.750 --> 29:50.620
Well, the "Bridgeville Post"
sure ain't what it used to be.

30:03.400 --> 30:05.240
What do you want?

30:05.270 --> 30:07.010
Maybe I should speak
to Officer Pundik.

30:08.570 --> 30:10.370
Pundik is picking up Adrian
for questioning.

30:11.580 --> 30:12.650
Why?

30:12.740 --> 30:13.470
Because he's a witness.

30:13.580 --> 30:15.350
Why do you think?

30:15.450 --> 30:17.120
Now, you can either talk to me,

30:17.150 --> 30:20.450
or you can wait an hour or two
until Pundik's done.

30:32.160 --> 30:33.930
You stay right where you are.

31:00.540 --> 31:02.286
I'm sorry.
I know this isn't what you want,

31:02.310 --> 31:05.250
but it's for the best,
the way things are right now.

31:05.310 --> 31:07.810
You understand that, don't you?

31:11.890 --> 31:15.160
Everything I do,
I do to protect you.

31:15.220 --> 31:17.160
Protect me?

31:17.220 --> 31:18.220
You're not protecting me.

31:18.290 --> 31:20.130
You're controlling me.

31:20.160 --> 31:21.830
Sweetie, I just...

31:21.900 --> 31:25.240
Please. You just don't
want me to do what you did.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.380
But guess what. I won't,
'cause I'm nothing like you.

31:30.470 --> 31:32.910
What do you mean do what I did?

31:32.970 --> 31:34.410
What do you mean?

31:34.470 --> 31:37.240
You said it yourself.
It's a small town.

31:37.310 --> 31:39.250
I know.

31:39.310 --> 31:41.150
Everyone knows.

31:42.650 --> 31:44.020
Knows what?

31:44.080 --> 31:45.110
That you were a slut.

32:05.940 --> 32:07.540
I'm gonna go pick up the Valium.

32:07.610 --> 32:09.980
Do you want to come,
or do you want to wait here?

32:28.560 --> 32:30.860
Looks amazing.

32:30.900 --> 32:32.870
It's moving against the wind.

32:37.240 --> 32:38.580
Hey, Alex.

32:38.640 --> 32:40.240
Dad, won't you
please come with us?

32:40.310 --> 32:41.680
I don't want to go with Mom.

32:41.740 --> 32:43.580
I'll be there soon, honey.

32:43.640 --> 32:45.410
You'll be fine. Where's Mom?

32:45.480 --> 32:46.810
We're at the mall.

32:46.880 --> 32:48.250
Dad, please,
I don't want to leave.

32:48.320 --> 32:50.220
It'll be fine, honey.

32:50.250 --> 32:53.050
Okay... Hello?

32:53.090 --> 32:54.230
Wow.
Alex?

32:57.590 --> 32:58.760
Signal's gone.

32:59.930 --> 33:02.200
Well, let's go back inside.

33:02.260 --> 33:04.030
It'll blow over in a minute.

33:04.100 --> 33:06.270
Nah, just... just wait.
Just wait.

33:06.330 --> 33:08.230
I want to get
a photo for the missus.

33:08.270 --> 33:10.570
Great. You do that, Pundik.
We'll see you inside.

33:10.600 --> 33:12.100
Ah, God.

33:37.130 --> 33:38.530
God.

33:38.600 --> 33:39.900
Ah!

33:41.870 --> 33:42.800
God! Get off me!

33:42.870 --> 33:44.870
Ahh!

33:49.040 --> 33:50.240
Get off me!

33:55.650 --> 33:57.390
Shit! Get off me!

34:11.670 --> 34:13.510
Get... Get in the car.
We gotta go.

34:13.570 --> 34:14.976
- What is it?
- We gotta get out of here.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.270
- Let's go.
- What's going on?

34:16.340 --> 34:17.679
- Come on! Let's go!
- Adrian.

34:17.739 --> 34:19.110
Wait in the car.

34:19.170 --> 34:20.510
Kevin!

34:32.520 --> 34:33.989
Wow.

34:34.020 --> 34:36.620
Should we wait till it's gone?

34:36.690 --> 34:38.690
It's beautiful.

34:39.860 --> 34:41.530
We'll drag the bikes.

34:41.600 --> 34:42.699
- Mm.
- This way.

34:44.530 --> 34:47.370
It's like that time
at the inn up by Chocolate Lake.

34:47.429 --> 34:49.830
Except we stayed in bed.

34:51.340 --> 34:54.380
What... This...
This way, I think.

34:54.440 --> 34:57.210
Oh, no, wrong. Wrong.

34:57.280 --> 34:58.780
Wrong direction.

34:58.850 --> 35:01.320
These trees were by the church,

35:01.380 --> 35:03.550
so that means the bikes
must be that way.

35:09.360 --> 35:11.560
It's too thick, hon.

35:11.630 --> 35:12.970
Let's get back inside.

35:13.030 --> 35:14.570
Oh!

35:14.630 --> 35:16.170
Let's go.

35:17.460 --> 35:18.730
Are you real?

35:18.800 --> 35:20.030
We are. We are. We are real.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.640
But it's all real.

35:22.700 --> 35:23.700
Put down the gun.

35:28.140 --> 35:29.540
I'm sorry.

35:29.580 --> 35:31.020
I couldn't know.

35:32.410 --> 35:33.410
Forgive me.

36:07.640 --> 36:10.140
Mrs. Raven?

36:10.180 --> 36:11.550
Are you okay?

36:14.480 --> 36:15.480
Oh...

36:25.390 --> 36:26.760
- What's going on?
- It's okay.

36:26.860 --> 36:28.660
We just need...
Help!

36:28.690 --> 36:29.690
Help!

36:30.730 --> 36:31.760
In here.

36:31.860 --> 36:34.000
Help!

36:34.030 --> 36:36.270
Over here, man. Help.

36:36.370 --> 36:37.910
Hey, get us the...
Outta here, man.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.400
- Look...
- You gotta get us out.

36:39.500 --> 36:40.846
- Calm down. Calm down.
- You don't understand.

36:40.870 --> 36:42.670
We'll die if we stay.

36:42.710 --> 36:44.486
There's something in the mist,
and then it killed my dog.

36:44.510 --> 36:45.850
You can't let us stay.

36:45.880 --> 36:47.880
Shut the... up!

36:47.910 --> 36:49.710
What has happened out there?

36:50.920 --> 36:52.760
I don't know.

36:52.850 --> 36:55.120
What are you gonna do?

36:55.220 --> 36:56.620
Find my wife and daughter.

36:56.720 --> 36:59.060
No,
what are you gonna do with us?

36:59.090 --> 37:01.090
Look, what...
Whatever's happened,

37:01.190 --> 37:02.930
I'm sure it'll be over soon.

37:03.030 --> 37:04.536
Please, I'm just here because
the Sheriff thought I was crazy

37:04.560 --> 37:06.430
when I warned them
about the mist.

37:06.530 --> 37:08.570
Don't let her out.
She looks unstable.

37:08.600 --> 37:09.700
Like she did something bad.

37:09.730 --> 37:11.970
Not to anyone good.

37:14.910 --> 37:19.550
Unlike me, you're a nice guy,

37:19.580 --> 37:21.750
and you're never gonna be
able to live with yourself

37:21.780 --> 37:24.450
if you leave us behind,
'cause, if you do, we die,

37:24.550 --> 37:25.950
and you know it.

37:26.050 --> 37:29.290
Besides, if there's
something out there,

37:29.390 --> 37:30.830
how are you gonna survive

37:30.920 --> 37:34.390
taking care of a scared
little freak on your own?

37:35.430 --> 37:39.300
Get us out, and we'll help you.

37:41.570 --> 37:43.110
The more the better.

37:46.270 --> 37:47.640
I'll find the keys.

38:21.770 --> 38:23.370
Eve Copeland?

38:24.480 --> 38:25.950
Here you go.

38:28.950 --> 38:30.390
Mrs. Carmody.

38:30.480 --> 38:32.020
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

38:32.120 --> 38:35.390
Talking to those kids about sex.
Why.

38:35.490 --> 38:37.960
Because you can raise
your child any way you want to...

38:37.990 --> 38:40.860
And clearly you have...
But leave my child out of it.

38:41.990 --> 38:43.960
You pathetic bitch.

39:35.550 --> 39:38.850
What is it?
Ever seen this before?

39:41.720 --> 39:44.460
It looks so dense.
MAN♪2 It's just fog.

40:08.910 --> 40:10.380
Alex?

40:10.420 --> 40:11.390
Alex?

40:11.420 --> 40:13.320
Mom?! Mom.

40:13.420 --> 40:15.160
What's going on?

40:15.250 --> 40:17.390
We need to get inside now.

40:27.970 --> 40:30.470
It's okay. We're inside.

40:30.570 --> 40:31.946
No! Don't!
There's something out there.

40:31.970 --> 40:33.770
- What?
- I don't know, but...

40:33.810 --> 40:36.780
I'm so fed up with you people
and your need for attention.

40:36.810 --> 40:38.250
It's true.

40:38.280 --> 40:40.040
Said the girl
who lied about getting raped.

40:40.950 --> 40:42.180
Come.

41:01.130 --> 41:02.530
Jesus!

41:02.630 --> 41:04.830
What's going on?

41:26.860 --> 41:28.730
Call 911!

41:35.300 --> 41:36.300
You're not getting one.

41:39.370 --> 41:41.140
Are you... kidding me?

41:42.540 --> 41:44.310
That's the way it's gonna be.

41:51.680 --> 41:52.920
All right, this way.

41:53.020 --> 41:55.360
Connor will be waiting
right outside.

42:26.180 --> 42:27.380
Did anyone call the police?

42:27.420 --> 42:29.060
No.

42:29.090 --> 42:30.460
There's no phone signal.

42:30.560 --> 42:33.030
Hey, I just want to go home.

42:33.060 --> 42:35.300
I know,
but we're gonna have to wait

42:35.390 --> 42:36.730
till we find out
what's going on.

42:37.760 --> 42:39.560
Do you trust me now?

42:41.600 --> 42:43.570
It'll be fine.

42:44.940 --> 42:46.780
The police will help us.

42:46.870 --> 42:48.810
Dad'll get here.

42:48.910 --> 42:49.910
I'm here.

42:51.580 --> 42:52.820
We're safe.

42:54.080 --> 42:57.250
I trust you.

42:59.620 --> 43:03.220
You're safe.
