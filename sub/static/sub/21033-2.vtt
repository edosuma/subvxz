WEBVTT

00:01.499 --> 00:03.249
No, for real, you should've
been there, Wasp.

00:03.249 --> 00:04.832
I was like,
"Blop-blop-blop, bam!"

00:04.832 --> 00:06.333
And Yellojacket went down!

00:06.333 --> 00:07.790
Mmm-mmm.
Winging it just works.

00:07.790 --> 00:09.749
(ALARM BLARING)

00:11.374 --> 00:13.083
ALIEN:<i> With the human's</i>
<i>growth technology,</i>

00:13.083 --> 00:15.249
we will finally be able
to take over Earth,

00:15.249 --> 00:17.083
and then, the entire galaxy!

00:17.083 --> 00:18.749
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

00:18.749 --> 00:21.541
Hey there, little buddies,
what are you up to?

00:21.541 --> 00:23.707
World domination?
Can't have that.

00:25.083 --> 00:26.832
Come on! Ow!

00:28.000 --> 00:30.582
You know what we need...
Hey! Wait up.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.041
(GRUNTING)

00:34.416 --> 00:36.291
What we need is a plan.

00:36.291 --> 00:37.666
None of your "winging it."

00:37.666 --> 00:39.416
Let's capture
the leader and...

00:39.416 --> 00:41.000
(MOCKINGLY)
My name is Wasp and I like
to come up with plans.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.333
Watch out, aliens,
I'm going to punch you,
'cause that's my plan.

00:43.333 --> 00:44.499
WASP: It's not funny, Scott.

00:44.499 --> 00:45.541
Yes, it is. Uh-oh.

00:45.541 --> 00:47.041
(SCREAMING)

00:47.041 --> 00:48.124
(GROWLING)

00:48.124 --> 00:49.582
Hand over the growth disc.

00:49.582 --> 00:51.541
With it, we can finally grow
as big and mighty

00:51.541 --> 00:54.208
as our empire
was always destined to be,

00:54.208 --> 00:55.749
and rule the Earth!

00:55.749 --> 00:57.707
Okay, guys, yeah.

00:57.707 --> 00:59.374
Sure, we totally give up.
What?

00:59.374 --> 01:01.541
Let us go
and I'll give you the disc.
Agreed.

01:01.541 --> 01:02.707
WASP: Have you lost
your mind?

01:02.707 --> 01:03.666
That's unrelated.

01:06.166 --> 01:07.790
(LAUGHING)

01:07.790 --> 01:09.249
I feel the power...

01:09.249 --> 01:10.249
(GROANING)

01:12.749 --> 01:13.832
Now what?

01:13.832 --> 01:15.416
Now, for round two.

01:15.416 --> 01:16.666
(SCREAMING)

01:18.749 --> 01:19.874
WASP: Please tell me
you have a plan.

01:25.707 --> 01:26.790
ALIEN: I surrender.

01:26.790 --> 01:28.374
Just like I was saying,
you know?

01:28.374 --> 01:29.790
Always have a plan.
