01:04.662 --> 01:06.496
(Gilby Smalls) Well, when I was a kid,

01:06.498 --> 01:08.499
I really wanted to be an astronaut.

01:08.501 --> 01:09.900
You know, floating around,

01:09.902 --> 01:12.568
no school or parents
to tell you what to do.

01:12.570 --> 01:14.505
But I don't really like danger.

01:14.507 --> 01:16.205
Ow!

01:16.207 --> 01:17.641
And my mother wasn't very supportive.

01:17.643 --> 01:20.576
- You're gonna hurt yourself doin' that!
- Ow!

01:20.578 --> 01:22.779
(Gilby) I thought
photography would be cool,

01:22.781 --> 01:25.181
you know, 'cause girls love
to have their picture taken.

01:25.183 --> 01:28.151
- Ow!
- But I just didn't have the right feel for it.

01:28.153 --> 01:29.686
You stupid jerk!

01:29.688 --> 01:32.889
If my nose is broken, my
parents are gonna sue you!

01:37.629 --> 01:40.496
(Dr. Pollard) So, Gilby,
what is your occupation?

01:40.498 --> 01:41.632
Occupation?

01:41.634 --> 01:42.832
Yes, what it is that you do now?

01:42.834 --> 01:45.201
I mean, what is your profession?

01:45.203 --> 01:47.737
Why do people have to
be defined by their jobs?

01:47.739 --> 01:50.374
A person's job should not be
a reflection of their value

01:50.376 --> 01:52.241
as a human being, right?

01:52.243 --> 01:54.178
I am not my job.

01:54.180 --> 01:55.645
I mean, why can't people just live anymore?

01:55.647 --> 01:56.913
You know, what's wrong with that?

01:56.915 --> 01:57.948
There's nothing wrong with that.

01:57.950 --> 01:59.850
I mean, do-do you...

01:59.852 --> 02:01.451
feel like there's
something wrong with that?

02:01.453 --> 02:02.818
I don't.

02:02.820 --> 02:04.687
Might as well have your job and salary

02:04.689 --> 02:06.323
tattooed on your forehead.

02:06.325 --> 02:07.857
'Cause, these days, it's like,

02:07.859 --> 02:10.293
"What's your name? Okay, what do you do?"

02:10.294 --> 02:11.495
That's clever, but the issue is,

02:11.497 --> 02:12.895
do you like your job?

02:12.897 --> 02:16.199
Eh... I work at a crappy
cell phone store. It sucks.

02:16.201 --> 02:18.401
But, at least it's easy, not too stressful,

02:18.403 --> 02:20.536
and-and I can live my life.

02:20.538 --> 02:22.608
Is somebody making you feel
pressure about your job?

02:24.409 --> 02:26.542
My girlfriend, Sharon.

02:26.544 --> 02:28.644
I see... and what does Sharon do?

02:28.646 --> 02:30.513
She teaches psychology at Columbia,

02:30.515 --> 02:32.448
and she's doing research for some book.

02:32.450 --> 02:33.917
Well, that sounds great.

02:33.919 --> 02:37.221
I'd love to read it when it's published.

02:37.223 --> 02:39.222
Do you live together?

02:39.224 --> 02:40.923
Well, that's another sore issue.

02:40.925 --> 02:43.292
She thinks I'm avoiding responsibility,

02:43.294 --> 02:44.428
but I disagree.

02:44.430 --> 02:45.963
I'm avoiding stress,

02:45.965 --> 02:48.431
which I think is a pretty noble quest.

02:48.433 --> 02:51.300
Stress is linked to cancer
and high blood pressure.

02:51.302 --> 02:53.370
So, you think that living with Sharon

02:53.372 --> 02:55.339
will actually make you ill.

02:55.341 --> 02:58.308
Well, I think living with
any woman can be dangerous.

02:58.310 --> 03:00.577
Why do you think married
men die before their wives?

03:00.579 --> 03:03.246
(chuckles) Have...

03:03.248 --> 03:04.780
- No?
- (clears throat)

03:04.782 --> 03:07.284
Gilby, she's working
on her research project,

03:07.286 --> 03:08.818
and a book may come out of it,

03:08.820 --> 03:10.786
and you're working at a
crappy cell phone store.

03:10.788 --> 03:13.556
But, she's not a better
person than you are, Gilby.

03:13.558 --> 03:14.858
Thank you.

03:14.860 --> 03:16.930
She just might have a brighter future.

03:22.001 --> 03:24.734
Look, man, why don't you just
do somethin' romantic together?

03:24.736 --> 03:26.335
(Gilby) Do you have any ideas?

03:26.337 --> 03:27.937
Sure, man. Go see a movie.

03:27.939 --> 03:29.639
Check out a couples' movie. She'll love it.

03:29.641 --> 03:32.508
Oh. Like a romantic comedy? Like what?

03:32.510 --> 03:34.511
I don't know. Something
like "Jerry Maguire."

03:34.513 --> 03:35.711
It's Tom Cruise
and what's-his-face,

03:35.713 --> 03:36.979
and he's running through the rain,

03:36.981 --> 03:38.614
and he goes in and he does this whole spiel

03:38.616 --> 03:40.017
in front of all of her hard-up friends

03:40.019 --> 03:41.484
that are eatin' potato
chips and wearing Spanx.

03:41.486 --> 03:42.818
Girls love that stuff.

03:42.820 --> 03:44.453
Is that the one with that kid?

03:44.455 --> 03:46.455
- The ten-pound head kid?
- I don't like that kid.

03:46.457 --> 03:47.691
Guy really creeps me out.

03:47.693 --> 03:48.892
- Forget movies, man.
- (chuckles)

03:48.894 --> 03:50.560
Look, what does she like to do?

03:50.562 --> 03:51.862
- What does she wanna do?
- I don't know.

03:51.864 --> 03:55.631
She likes lakes. Like, nature.

03:55.633 --> 03:57.934
- Problem solved. That's great.
- I'm gonna take to a lake?

03:57.936 --> 03:59.036
That's gonna solve everything?

03:59.038 --> 04:00.370
It's a start, Gilby.

04:00.372 --> 04:01.838
Why am I taking your advice?

04:01.840 --> 04:04.507
When was the last time
you even had a girlfriend?

04:04.509 --> 04:06.977
You wonder why she doesn't
wanna spend time with you.

04:06.979 --> 04:08.945
Is it my shot yet?

04:08.947 --> 04:10.780
No, uh, you just lost.

04:10.782 --> 04:13.352
W... I didn't even go.

04:16.387 --> 04:20.389
I guess, if you ever Google
"beautiful lake near New York",

04:20.391 --> 04:22.892
just stay on the first page.

to look at it spiritually,

09:50.087 --> 09:52.756
Well, he's on his way,
and so you need to leave.

09:52.758 --> 09:55.157
I-I have nowhere to go.

09:55.159 --> 09:56.892
I-I just lost my job,

09:56.894 --> 09:58.228
and then my apartment burns down,

09:58.230 --> 10:00.129
and n-now you're gonna dump me?

10:00.131 --> 10:02.331
Right now? I mean, I...

10:02.333 --> 10:04.934
Can I at least shower before
I begin my life on the street?

10:04.936 --> 10:06.869
No. You can't take a shower here,

10:06.871 --> 10:08.137
and you're not gonna be homeless.

10:08.139 --> 10:09.406
Stop piling on like that.

10:09.408 --> 10:11.373
It's bad for your confidence.

10:11.375 --> 10:14.243
I'm con-I'm confident that you're insane!

10:14.245 --> 10:15.811
Okay, you know what?

10:15.813 --> 10:17.747
I have made my feelings very clear.

10:17.749 --> 10:19.949
I am not gonna let you
give me some guilt trip.

10:19.951 --> 10:22.951
Guilt trip? You're dumping
me after I've lost everything.

10:22.953 --> 10:24.720
That's a fact trip.

10:24.722 --> 10:27.190
Okay, this? Not gonna work.

10:27.192 --> 10:28.791
You're gonna have to go.

10:28.793 --> 10:32.027
You had to pick today
to become a sociopath?

10:32.029 --> 10:34.129
- Great, great.
- (door buzzer)

10:34.131 --> 10:35.931
He's here. Great.

10:35.933 --> 10:37.700
You are my landlord's cousin,

10:37.702 --> 10:39.301
and you came to the wrong apartment.

10:39.303 --> 10:41.304
You want me to lie for you? You nuts?

10:41.306 --> 10:43.908
You are nuts! Get out of my apartment!

10:47.345 --> 10:50.780
- Hey, baby.
- Hi. You're early.

10:50.782 --> 10:53.749
I just couldn't wait any longer to see you.

10:53.751 --> 10:56.219
- Mmm.
- Come here.

10:56.221 --> 10:58.121
Hi.

10:58.123 --> 11:00.156
- Um...
- I'm sorry.

11:00.158 --> 11:03.026
- I... This is...
- I, uh, didn't realize you, uh, had company.

11:03.028 --> 11:04.493
I don't, actually.

11:04.495 --> 11:05.962
Hi, I'm Gilby.

11:05.964 --> 11:07.030
Calvin.

11:07.032 --> 11:09.398
Calvin. Hi, Calvin. Did...

11:09.400 --> 11:13.169
Sharon, did you not tell
your friend about me?

11:13.171 --> 11:15.371
No, no, I don't think so.
Did you tell me about Gilby?

11:15.373 --> 11:18.775
- No, why would I?
- Well, we're...

11:18.777 --> 11:20.844
I'm Sharon's brother.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.478
- Oh!
- Yeah.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.012
- Great to meet you, man.
- Yeah, hey.

11:24.014 --> 11:25.515
Why didn't you tell me you had a brother?

11:25.517 --> 11:28.383
I-I don't know. It must
have slipped my mind.

11:28.385 --> 11:31.153
Why didn't you tell
him about your twin bro?

11:31.155 --> 11:33.156
Twins? Ha! Twins.

11:33.158 --> 11:34.456
(chuckles)

11:34.458 --> 11:36.526
Yeah, you know, now that you mention it,

11:36.528 --> 11:38.460
- you guys do look alike.
- You see it.

11:38.462 --> 11:41.330
- I see it. Yeah.
- I don't think so.

11:41.332 --> 11:43.499
- People say that!
- No one says that.

11:43.501 --> 11:46.002
- It's kind of a thing.
- It's not a thing.

11:46.004 --> 11:48.204
Do you guys, like, uh,
read each other's minds?

11:48.206 --> 11:50.473
- (laughing)
- Sometimes.

11:50.475 --> 11:51.807
Ooh!

11:51.809 --> 11:53.243
(laughing)

11:53.245 --> 11:55.011
- No.
- No, no.

11:55.013 --> 11:57.347
But we are closer than you can imagine.

11:57.349 --> 12:00.983
- Oh, I'm sure.
- You know what? That's completely true

12:00.985 --> 12:04.186
because we share the same taste in men.

12:04.188 --> 12:06.355
- (Calvin) So, you're, uh...
- Is, uh, is that right?

12:06.357 --> 12:09.825
(Sharon) Gay as the day is long.

12:09.827 --> 12:11.094
- Loves penis.
- Okay.

12:11.096 --> 12:13.897
- Loves penis, this one.
- Okay.

12:13.899 --> 12:16.299
Hey, what's with all the-the
boxes going around here?

12:16.301 --> 12:18.167
Are you, uh, redecorating
your place or something?

12:18.169 --> 12:19.569
Yes, yes, exactly.

12:19.571 --> 12:22.539
You know, us gays just love to redecorate.

12:22.541 --> 12:24.507
- Looks good.
- When we're not loving penis so much.

12:24.509 --> 12:25.941
Which you do. Mm-hmm.

12:25.943 --> 12:27.209
All the time.

12:27.211 --> 12:29.445
Yeah, we're loving hanging new drapes.

12:29.447 --> 12:30.814
(laughing)

12:30.816 --> 12:32.448
- I know. I know.
- This guy is funny.

12:32.450 --> 12:34.917
This guy, this-this guy,

12:34.919 --> 12:36.552
you-you picked a real winner.

12:36.554 --> 12:37.987
God, you guys are getting along so well.

12:37.989 --> 12:39.354
I hate to break it up,

12:39.356 --> 12:43.358
but Gilby is late for his date with a man.

12:43.360 --> 12:46.061
- So, you should go.
- Oh, you know what?

12:46.063 --> 12:48.198
I-I didn't tell you.
I changed those plans.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.598
'Cause I was just feeling a little tired,

12:49.600 --> 12:51.568
so I just wanna kick back and relax.

12:51.570 --> 12:54.337
- I'm just gonna stay here.
- (Sharon) Here? Alone?

12:54.339 --> 12:56.104
I don't think so. No, not by yourself.

12:56.106 --> 12:58.007
Then it's cool if I tag along with you two?

12:58.009 --> 12:59.275
No!

12:59.277 --> 13:01.076
No.

13:01.078 --> 13:03.613
- No, but you should stay here.
- So, just stay.

13:03.615 --> 13:06.882
Whatever you want, sis. Just stay? Okay.

13:06.884 --> 13:10.219
You know what? I'm gonna get my jacket...

13:10.221 --> 13:12.555
- for our date.
- Yeah, all right, then.

13:12.557 --> 13:15.090
So, you can...

13:15.092 --> 13:16.459
- Stay.
- Stay here.

13:16.461 --> 13:19.295
- Stay here.
- I guess.

13:19.297 --> 13:22.098
- Hey, a little advice about my sister.
- Oh, yeah, give it to me.

13:22.100 --> 13:25.300
Yeah, so, no matter
how aggressive she gets,

13:25.302 --> 13:26.569
just play hard to get.

13:26.571 --> 13:28.238
Don't fall for it. It's all a test.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.006
Like, don't even kiss her. She'll love it.

13:30.008 --> 13:31.541
She'll go nuts. Yeah, yeah.

13:31.543 --> 13:34.109
- Okay, thanks. Thanks for the tip.
- No problem. Yeah.

13:34.111 --> 13:36.145
- (Sharon) Gilby!
- Help a guy out. Yeah?

13:36.147 --> 13:39.147
(Sharon) Think you could come
help me pick out a jacket, bro?

13:39.149 --> 13:41.150
You know it, sister.

13:41.152 --> 13:44.924
- Okay. Don't do anything.
- Nothin'. Okay, cool.

13:47.491 --> 13:49.358
I want you outta here by the time I'm back.

13:49.360 --> 13:51.526
- You don't mean that.
- Yes, I do.

13:51.528 --> 13:53.262
I want you and your stinking boxes

13:53.264 --> 13:55.297
out of my apartment because
we're finished, Gilby.

13:55.299 --> 13:56.632
Got it?

13:56.634 --> 13:58.001
Huh.

13:58.003 --> 14:00.435
It's...

14:00.437 --> 14:01.905
Hey...

14:01.907 --> 14:03.672
Get the hell outta my bedroom.

14:03.674 --> 14:10.412
♪♪

14:10.414 --> 14:13.483
I have a huge surprise for you.

14:13.485 --> 14:16.352
- You do? I have a huge surprise.
- No, wait, you go first.

14:16.354 --> 14:18.421
- Can I? I can-I can go first.
- Yes, go, go.

14:18.423 --> 14:20.355
I think I finally found something

14:20.357 --> 14:21.991
we're both gonna love.

14:21.993 --> 14:23.392
I'm all ears.

14:23.394 --> 14:24.560
I don't think you're ready for this.

14:24.562 --> 14:27.129
I-I may need a sip of water. All right.

14:27.131 --> 14:29.598
A tantric retreat.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.434
- Hmm!
- Right?

14:31.436 --> 14:34.170
- Right?
- Right.

14:34.172 --> 14:36.171
Um, like the thing...
Uh, that's a group thing,

14:36.173 --> 14:37.172
though, right?

14:37.174 --> 14:39.275
Mmm, it's a sex thing.

14:39.277 --> 14:41.710
- Well, um...
- I mean, come on.

14:41.712 --> 14:46.214
It's a lot of sex with
me. Or... No, with me.

14:46.216 --> 14:48.184
(laughs) Um...

14:48.186 --> 14:49.419
Come on. It's gonna...

14:49.421 --> 14:51.054
It'll help our sex life.

14:51.056 --> 14:53.323
That part I'm in on.

14:53.325 --> 14:55.724
If it's the sex with you
and me helping the-the...

14:55.726 --> 14:57.093
Our sex life thing, then yes.

14:57.095 --> 14:58.994
- Really?
- I'm in.

14:58.996 --> 15:00.296
You're not gonna take it back?

15:00.298 --> 15:01.698
- You're really in?
- I'm totally in.

15:01.700 --> 15:03.432
- Babe!
- Put it in the books. We're going.

15:03.434 --> 15:05.401
Do you realize how happy I am?

15:05.403 --> 15:07.369
- That makes me so happy. Cheers.
- Okay. Cheers.

15:07.371 --> 15:08.671
(glasses clink)

15:08.673 --> 15:10.672
It's not a competition of surprises,

15:10.674 --> 15:12.975
but if it were, mine would win.

15:12.977 --> 15:15.411
- Okay. All right, I'm ready.
- Are you ready? Yeah.

15:15.413 --> 15:18.348
How would you like to
spend three weeks in Paris?

15:18.350 --> 15:19.348
Are you serious?

15:19.350 --> 15:20.682
I'm serious.

15:20.684 --> 15:23.051
- Paris? Yes, please!
- Yes, yes.

15:23.053 --> 15:24.753
- Are you kidding me? When?
- Only a-only a lunatic would say, "no."

15:24.755 --> 15:27.156
We leave on the 15th.

15:27.158 --> 15:28.623
Okay.

15:28.625 --> 15:30.727
All right, but the retreat is on the 18th.

15:30.729 --> 15:34.262
- So, do you... Can we...
- Oh, grr, what do I do?

15:34.264 --> 15:37.099
Do I roll around in the
grass with crazy people,

15:37.101 --> 15:38.501
or do I go to Paris? Grr.

15:38.503 --> 15:40.770
We can push it back a little bit, right?

15:40.772 --> 15:42.338
No, no, I can't, I can't.
I got work in Paris.

15:42.340 --> 15:44.109
I gotta be there for the 15th.

15:45.509 --> 15:47.443
Oh, right, okay.

15:47.445 --> 15:49.645
- This is a business trip.
- Well, no, I-I...

15:49.647 --> 15:51.113
Was that your surprise?

15:51.115 --> 15:53.516
Do you not remember
what happened last time?

15:53.518 --> 15:56.585
I was by myself the whole time. You...

15:56.587 --> 15:59.155
- I never even saw you.
- You were at the museum. Took all those great pictures.

15:59.157 --> 16:01.257
- We had a great time.
- Oh, which was wonderful.

16:01.259 --> 16:03.026
It's always about work with you.

16:03.028 --> 16:04.426
I'm... (sighs)

16:04.428 --> 16:06.661
Work comes before me, before us,

16:06.663 --> 16:08.097
before everything in your life.

16:08.099 --> 16:10.565
Fine. Don't go.

16:10.567 --> 16:11.733
Can we get the check, miss?

16:11.735 --> 16:14.337
Yeah, we're gonna take this to go.

16:14.339 --> 16:16.738
Really?

16:16.740 --> 16:19.776
You win.

16:19.778 --> 16:22.277
Great.

16:22.279 --> 16:25.281
Do you wanna come in?

16:25.283 --> 16:26.549
Mmm.

16:26.551 --> 16:28.151
What's wrong?

16:28.153 --> 16:31.487
I don't know. I just wanna take it slow.

16:31.489 --> 16:34.523
Come on. You know you wanna come in.

16:34.525 --> 16:36.291
No, what about your brother?

16:36.293 --> 16:37.392
Who?

16:37.394 --> 16:39.528
Oh, Gilby? No.

16:39.530 --> 16:43.568
He's long gone. It's just you and me.

16:44.769 --> 16:46.502
Fish sticks?

16:46.504 --> 16:48.204
Hey, hey.

16:48.206 --> 16:49.539
(chuckles) Well, that was...

16:49.541 --> 16:50.839
Yeah.

16:50.841 --> 16:53.209
(laughing) I'll call you tomorrow.

16:53.211 --> 16:55.777
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:55.779 --> 16:57.647
- Does he not like fish sticks?
- Get in the kitchen.

16:57.649 --> 16:59.681
Why the hell are you still here?

16:59.683 --> 17:01.617
Okay, you know, I gave it a lot of thought,

17:01.619 --> 17:03.719
and I decided that I forgive you.

17:03.721 --> 17:05.320
Oh, you forgive me.

17:05.323 --> 17:06.655
Yes, I just wanted to let you know,

17:06.656 --> 17:08.257
so that you don't torture yourself.

17:08.259 --> 17:09.858
By the way, where is the tartar sauce?

17:09.861 --> 17:12.228
How-how do you not understand this?

17:12.230 --> 17:15.263
- It's over.
- We're great together!

17:15.266 --> 17:18.233
Okay, we have some problems,
but so does everyone.

17:18.236 --> 17:20.169
We are not great together.

17:20.171 --> 17:22.471
- So, you never loved me?
- Gilby, come on.

17:22.473 --> 17:26.209
I was in love with you.
But, you're so immature.

17:26.211 --> 17:29.478
- And I am evolving, and you're not even trying!
- Okay, okay, so,

17:29.480 --> 17:31.146
th-th-this is all because
I don't have a career

17:31.148 --> 17:32.748
- you approve of, right?
- Okay, all right.

17:32.750 --> 17:34.851
Well, 'A', I don't have
that career anymore,

17:34.853 --> 17:37.385
and 'B', how shallow can you be?

17:37.387 --> 17:38.821
Just keep telling yourself that

17:38.823 --> 17:40.590
- if that's what makes you feel good.
- I will.

17:40.592 --> 17:43.659
Okay, great, but this whole
idea that work is somehow

17:43.661 --> 17:45.760
the root of all evil is an excuse for you

17:45.762 --> 17:47.596
to not ever do anything with your life.

17:47.598 --> 17:49.431
What? Oh, and this guy...

17:49.433 --> 17:52.567
- This what's-his-face, Melvin...
- Calvin! Calvin!

17:52.569 --> 17:55.371
Whatever! You're gonna tell
me he's emotionally mature?

17:55.373 --> 17:57.739
Yes, actually. He is in
touch with his emotions,

17:57.741 --> 17:59.408
and his career, and his sexuality.

17:59.410 --> 18:00.610
Whoa, whoa!

18:00.612 --> 18:02.344
What do you mean, his sexuality?

18:02.346 --> 18:04.713
Calvin's openly bi.

18:04.715 --> 18:06.815
You could never be that open.

18:06.817 --> 18:10.186
Finally, something we both agree on.

You don't want me here?

18:24.602 --> 18:27.569
Jeez, Mom, I never ask you for anything.

18:27.571 --> 18:29.738
I thought you'd be a lot
more comfortable in a hotel.

18:29.740 --> 18:31.407
Don't you think I
would've stayed in a hotel,

you wanna stay here anyway.

wanna stay with my own mom?

how much you smoke,

how many years do you have left?

21:39.830 --> 21:41.396
So, you ended it with her?

- She was devastated.
- Oh, it's gotta be tough.

21:43.401 --> 21:44.866

21:47.739 --> 21:50.472
- You're a terrible liar, Gilby.
- It was mutual.

21:50.474 --> 21:51.841
You know, we talked. I mean, we're adults.

21:51.843 --> 21:54.610
We decided the best thing for both of us,

21:54.612 --> 21:58.013
right now, in our lives,
was to just take some time.

21:58.015 --> 21:59.614
- So what actually happened?
- She left me

you were always complaining.

there was a-a stronger

24:10.114 --> 24:12.180

24:12.182 --> 24:14.816
she was able to realize himself.

24:14.818 --> 24:17.786
And he is, I think, much
happier than she was,

24:17.788 --> 24:19.587

But, seriously, you
fake it 'til you make it.

27:19.436 --> 27:21.069
You know, you really
wanna turn things around,

27:21.071 --> 27:22.403
you should follow my advice.

27:22.405 --> 27:25.340
Look, how much more do you have to lose?

27:25.342 --> 27:26.341
You're right.

27:26.343 --> 27:27.875
I, uh, I wanna make a change.

27:27.877 --> 27:29.077
Good.

27:29.079 --> 27:30.778
- No, I need to make a change.
- Yes.

27:30.780 --> 27:32.413
I kinda hit rock bottom.

27:32.415 --> 27:36.317
Apartment, job, girlfriend gone.

27:36.319 --> 27:38.754
Living with my mom.

27:38.756 --> 27:40.788
Any lower, then I'd have
to do something drastic,

27:40.790 --> 27:43.357
like throw myself in
front of a Bentley, or...

27:43.359 --> 27:44.927
Have you looked into that?

27:44.929 --> 27:46.461
I don't even-I don't even live in an area

27:46.463 --> 27:48.497
where Bentleys drive.

27:48.499 --> 27:50.865
I, you know, I gotta
start with, like, a Volvo.

27:50.867 --> 27:53.235
- Volvo's much more your...
- Volvo, yeah.

27:53.237 --> 27:55.170
- (laughing)
- Where are we going?

27:55.172 --> 27:57.372
Seriously, this party better be worth it.

27:57.374 --> 27:59.107
What kinda hip club is
in the middle of nowhere?

27:59.109 --> 28:00.843
So, about that, um...

28:00.845 --> 28:02.244
- Hey, hey!
- Little Kevvy!

28:02.246 --> 28:04.278
- Look who it is.
- You got so big!

28:04.280 --> 28:06.114
Give your auntie a kiss.

28:06.116 --> 28:07.382
(laughing)

28:07.384 --> 28:08.851
That's great. Hey!

28:08.853 --> 28:10.853
Oh, who is your little friend?

28:10.855 --> 28:13.055
Uh, I'm Gilby.

28:13.057 --> 28:14.189
Nibley?

28:14.191 --> 28:15.824
No, Gilby.

28:15.826 --> 28:18.026
Don't just stand there.
Come in. Join the party.

28:18.028 --> 28:19.393
- Here, I'll take your coat.
- Thank you.

28:19.395 --> 28:21.863
- You look so lovely.
- Oh, you're such a charmer.

28:21.865 --> 28:23.398
(laughing)

28:23.400 --> 28:26.067
I smell somethin' burning.
I hope it's not my ham.

28:26.069 --> 28:27.969
You ready for this?

28:27.971 --> 28:29.771
What the hell is this?

28:29.773 --> 28:31.172
It's my grandparent'' anniversary party.

28:31.174 --> 28:33.508
- This is an old farts party.
- Yeah, I know.

28:33.510 --> 28:35.009
I, uh, couldn't imagine anything worse,

28:35.011 --> 28:36.778
which is why I didn't come alone.

28:36.780 --> 28:38.013
Appreciate you being here.

28:38.015 --> 28:39.448
Grab a glass of wine, or five.

28:39.450 --> 28:41.949
Do somethin' about that.

28:41.951 --> 28:43.285
(Gertrude) Kevin! How are ya?

28:43.287 --> 28:44.553
Gertrude, you son of a gun!

28:44.555 --> 28:46.391
You gotta be kidding me!

28:50.894 --> 28:51.962
Oh.

28:57.233 --> 29:00.035
(piano playing)

29:00.037 --> 29:01.303
(collective chatter)

29:01.305 --> 29:04.275
♪♪

29:23.027 --> 29:24.895
Yeah, I know, right?

29:32.303 --> 29:33.602
Hey.

29:33.604 --> 29:36.039
Uh, red wine, please. Yeah, thank you.

29:39.108 --> 29:42.376
(sighs) Don't you just hate these things?

29:42.378 --> 29:44.078
Excuse me?

29:44.080 --> 29:45.546
I mean, it's all so fake.

29:45.548 --> 29:47.850
Everyone pretending to be
part of this big, happy family,

29:47.852 --> 29:50.084
then they won't see each
other again until the funeral.

29:50.086 --> 29:51.553
Let me guess.

29:51.555 --> 29:53.956
- Life coach?
- (chuckles) No.

29:53.958 --> 29:57.228
I, uh, I actually run my own company.

29:58.494 --> 30:00.295
Really? What kinda company?

30:00.297 --> 30:03.131
Uh, computers.

30:03.133 --> 30:05.566
Hmm. Didn't peg you for the corporate type.

30:05.568 --> 30:07.236
Oh, no, no, I'm not.

30:07.238 --> 30:10.471
Yeah, no, it was, uh, it
was more of a creative thing.

30:10.473 --> 30:12.641
- Design, or...
- Yeah, actually. Yeah, exactly like that.

30:12.643 --> 30:15.410
- Oh.
- Yeah, do you know somethin' about that?

30:15.412 --> 30:19.213
Yeah, I... More than I'd like.

30:19.215 --> 30:21.482
I hear ya.

30:21.484 --> 30:23.251
That's why I sold it.

30:23.253 --> 30:24.952
Just, you know, wasn't for me.

30:24.954 --> 30:26.421
You know, I had so much success so early,

30:26.423 --> 30:27.956
that I didn't really know

30:27.958 --> 30:29.624
what I actually was
passionate about, you know?

30:29.626 --> 30:32.494
- Good for you.
- Yeah, knowing yourself is its own kinda luxury.

30:32.496 --> 30:35.363
So, yeah, I'm just taking some time.

30:35.365 --> 30:37.199
Finding myself, spiritually.

30:37.201 --> 30:40.235
Well, I can relate to that.

30:40.237 --> 30:41.303
(glasses clink)

30:41.305 --> 30:44.506
(collective) Aww.

30:44.508 --> 30:46.341
(Gilby) Aww, that's so cute.

30:46.343 --> 30:48.176
(Rachel) Yeah.

30:48.178 --> 30:50.011
(Gilby) I bet she's
nagged the life out of him.

30:50.013 --> 30:51.646
- Wow!
- Yeah, yeah.

30:51.648 --> 30:53.481
I hear he's only 36.

30:53.483 --> 30:55.217
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:55.219 --> 30:56.351
So, let me guess.

30:56.353 --> 30:58.353
They're, uh, friends of yours.

30:58.355 --> 31:00.689
Uh, drinking buddies?
You did time together?

31:00.691 --> 31:03.691
No, no, I got it. Uh, swinging partners.

31:03.693 --> 31:05.294
Almost.

31:05.296 --> 31:07.228
They're my grandparents.

31:07.230 --> 31:10.332
(applause)

31:10.334 --> 31:13.337
(indistinct chatter)

31:18.709 --> 31:21.008
Hey, can I get a, uh, glass of white?

31:21.010 --> 31:22.244
Coming right up.

31:22.246 --> 31:23.545
Did you meet my sister, Rachel?

31:23.547 --> 31:26.213
Why didn't you tell me you had a sister?

31:26.215 --> 31:27.481
I don't know. It never came up.

31:27.483 --> 31:29.351
Well, how-how have I
never seen her before?

31:29.353 --> 31:30.651
Why is she never around?

31:30.653 --> 31:32.520
I don't see her around that much.

31:32.522 --> 31:34.189
I don't know. Our circles
don't really overlap.

31:34.191 --> 31:37.325
- Thanks.
- Dude, you gotta hook it up.

31:37.327 --> 31:39.227
What are you, nuts? You're the
Grinch that stole Christmas.

31:39.229 --> 31:41.662
What? Come on. What's the problem?

31:41.664 --> 31:43.532
I'm practically family now.

31:43.534 --> 31:45.267
That's right, Nibley.

31:45.269 --> 31:47.969
Here's the problem. You
see that guy over there.

31:47.971 --> 31:51.139
Smart guy, successful,
handsome, great posture?

31:51.141 --> 31:53.542
- Yeah, and?
- That's my brother-in-law.

31:53.544 --> 31:57.278
- (laughing)
- How many sisters do you have?

31:57.280 --> 32:00.548
I have one sister, Gilby.
He's married to her.

32:00.550 --> 32:04.018
Why does everything in my life
turn out to be a disappointment?

32:04.020 --> 32:06.153
Come on, man. It's train wrecks like you

32:06.155 --> 32:08.390
that make us feel good about ourselves.

32:08.392 --> 32:10.158
I'm kidding.

32:10.160 --> 32:12.494
I'm kinda kidding.

32:12.496 --> 32:15.363
Right before I was to walk down the aisle,

32:15.365 --> 32:17.199
my little ol' great-grandmother

32:17.201 --> 32:21.268
pulls me aside and tells
me, "Ria, you need to know...

32:21.270 --> 32:24.506
"a man's nature is a burden on a woman."

32:24.508 --> 32:25.640
(laughter)

32:25.642 --> 32:27.508
"Now, go get married."

32:27.510 --> 32:31.113
Oh, it's true, though. That's good.

32:31.115 --> 32:33.047
So, Eric, how's everything
goin' at the office?

32:33.049 --> 32:34.682
- Great, yeah.
- It's good?

32:34.684 --> 32:37.084
And you guys are doin'
similar as you had done before,

32:37.086 --> 32:38.553
except this is now your company.

32:38.555 --> 32:41.390
Yeah. Digital design,
branding, interactive campaigns.

32:41.392 --> 32:43.357
- That kinda thing.
- It's goin' well?

32:43.359 --> 32:46.027
Doin' great. We're expanding.
I've got this exciting, uh...

32:46.029 --> 32:48.162
(sighs) little gig in Paris,

32:48.164 --> 32:51.298
and I need to find someone to
look after things while I'm gone.

32:51.300 --> 32:53.035
Well, you were talking
about your design company

32:53.037 --> 32:54.436
that you used to own.

32:54.438 --> 32:56.604
I mean, maybe he could help you out.

32:56.606 --> 32:57.805
I'm sorry. You said what?

32:57.807 --> 32:59.474
Oh, right, earlier. Yeah, we were talk...

32:59.476 --> 33:01.476
I was telling Rachel about, um,

33:01.478 --> 33:03.277
my, uh, uh, design company.

33:03.279 --> 33:05.080
I ran a company, and sold it years ago.

33:05.082 --> 33:06.614
(Eric) Really? I find this fascinating.

33:06.616 --> 33:08.717
- I'm fascinated.
- What kinda work did you guys do?

33:08.719 --> 33:10.518
Uh, i-it was the same kinda thing.

33:10.520 --> 33:14.456
Design, branding, uh,
interactive campaigning.

33:14.458 --> 33:16.792
- Yeah.
- Wow! That's great.

33:16.794 --> 33:18.492
We don't-we don't have
to talk shop, by the way,

33:18.494 --> 33:20.295
if you don't want to because...

33:20.297 --> 33:22.130
I don't mind. I don't mind.

33:22.132 --> 33:25.199
Fantastic. This Paris
thing, it just popped up,

33:25.201 --> 33:28.269
and I've been worried that I wasn't
gonna find someone to cover for me.

33:28.271 --> 33:30.505
Is that something that
you'd be interested in, or...

33:30.507 --> 33:34.609
Um, I'm certainly not on the cutting edge,

33:34.611 --> 33:37.179
like I used to be, um,

33:37.181 --> 33:42.450
but I'm always curious to
see what the kids are up to.

33:42.452 --> 33:44.186
Look, I don't wanna
monopolize the conversation.

33:44.188 --> 33:46.488
No, no, it's fine. It's...

33:46.490 --> 33:48.190
Uh, but why don't you come by on Monday,

33:48.192 --> 33:50.558
and we can-we can, uh, talk there?

33:50.560 --> 33:52.827
Uh, great, yeah. Let's do it, Monday.

33:52.829 --> 33:54.196
Great.

33:54.198 --> 33:55.296
(Rachel) Great.

33:55.298 --> 33:56.363
(Kevin) Great.

33:56.365 --> 33:57.634
Great.

33:58.801 --> 34:00.469
(indistinct chatter)

34:00.471 --> 34:01.702
- Hey.
- Oh, thank you.

34:01.704 --> 34:03.438
Yeah.

34:03.440 --> 34:06.208
So, I guess I might have to
put my spiritual quest on hold,

34:06.210 --> 34:08.577
in order to help out your husband.

34:08.579 --> 34:10.478
Yeah, I'm sorry. I
shouldn't have said anything.

34:10.481 --> 34:12.646
- I don't know why I did.
- It's fine. I'm kidding.

34:12.648 --> 34:15.882
It's totally fine. I probably
deserve it for earlier.

34:15.885 --> 34:17.751
(chuckles) Yeah.

34:17.753 --> 34:20.121
Do you need help here?
There's a lotta dishes.

34:20.123 --> 34:21.822
No, no, I got it. I'm good. Thank you.

34:21.824 --> 34:24.159
You know, I can't believe
it's taken so long,

34:24.161 --> 34:27.329
but they're finally bringing competitive
dish curling into the Olympics.

34:27.331 --> 34:29.731
- You should look into it.
- Oh, you should see me carry garbage.

34:29.733 --> 34:31.867
Oh, please, garbage is one
of my greatest weaknesses.

34:31.869 --> 34:33.900
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

34:33.902 --> 34:35.637
You must have to go to
the gym to do all this.

34:35.639 --> 34:37.838
- It takes endurance.
- No, just yoga sometimes.

34:37.840 --> 34:39.907
- Yoga? Oh, cool, cool.
- Yeah.

34:39.909 --> 34:41.775
I'm-I'm totally into yoga.

34:41.777 --> 34:43.244
- Really?
- Yeah, I love it.

34:43.246 --> 34:44.813
What kind?

34:44.815 --> 34:48.849
What kind? Oh, well, of
course, there's multiple kinds.

34:48.851 --> 34:50.885
I, uh, I love it...

34:50.887 --> 34:53.889
Uh, you know, the... It's weight.

34:53.891 --> 34:56.358
(chuckling) Weight yoga?

34:56.360 --> 34:57.626
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

34:57.628 --> 35:00.195
Uh, for weight loss?

35:00.197 --> 35:01.595
Uh, well, no, I mean, it's-it's yoga,

35:01.597 --> 35:03.164
but it's weight-it's weight lifting.

35:03.166 --> 35:04.699
It's mostly for men,
so you might not have...

35:04.701 --> 35:07.369
But, lifting weights makes
your muscles more stiff...

35:07.371 --> 35:08.670
- right?
- Yes, no, it...

35:08.672 --> 35:09.737
- Yes, exact... You're right.
- Yeah.

35:09.739 --> 35:11.305
You're absolutely right.

35:11.307 --> 35:14.842
You get stiff, and then
you need to do more yoga.

35:14.844 --> 35:16.778
- It's sort of a capitalist approach to the whole thing.
- Okay.

35:16.780 --> 35:19.280
You just keep-keep going to class.

35:19.282 --> 35:21.782
Well, you should-you should try Rama yoga.

35:21.784 --> 35:23.450
The teachers are-are really great.

35:23.452 --> 35:24.586
- Really?
- Yeah.

35:24.588 --> 35:26.420
- That's where you go?
- Yeah.

35:26.422 --> 35:28.423
The Monday night class is awesome.

35:28.425 --> 35:29.791
Monday nights?

35:29.793 --> 35:32.494
That's when I have, um,
my Gangnam yoga class,

35:32.496 --> 35:35.229
- but maybe I can move somethin' around.
- (laughing)

35:35.231 --> 35:36.965
- There's no weights, though.
- No weights?

35:36.967 --> 35:39.700
- More traditional.
- More traditional?

35:39.702 --> 35:41.802
- If you can handle it.
- More-more like yoga, you're saying.

35:41.804 --> 35:44.371
- More like yoga. Actual yoga, yeah.
- More like real... Yeah, yeah.

35:44.373 --> 35:46.541
Okay, yeah, maybe I'll check it out.

35:46.543 --> 35:48.613
It sounds like fun.

35:50.347 --> 35:52.813
So, you now run a successful company?

35:52.815 --> 35:55.282
- Uh-huh.
- What the hell is that?

35:55.284 --> 35:57.251
I'm projecting a successful image.

35:57.253 --> 35:58.552
Thank you very much.

35:58.554 --> 36:00.854
All right, I appreciate the effort.

36:00.856 --> 36:03.291
Not necessarily experimenting
on my family, but...

36:03.293 --> 36:04.825
Oh, come on. Have a-have a little faith.

36:04.827 --> 36:06.661
I won't ruin the company.

And, by the way, I-I think you owe me,

36:13.769 --> 36:16.470
having tricked me into going
there in the first place.

36:16.472 --> 36:18.505
That's fair. That's true.

36:18.507 --> 36:20.342
Seems like you had a blast.

36:20.344 --> 36:22.010
It's just too bad you spent
all the time talking to Rachel.

36:22.012 --> 36:24.778
Yeah, I was having a much
better time talking to, uh,

36:24.780 --> 36:27.449
auntie what's-her-face
and uncle scoliosis.

36:27.451 --> 36:29.550
Scoliosis, yeah. Nicest guy.

- Don't be so dramatic.

36:35.925 --> 36:37.592
I didn't even know you could still do that,

36:37.594 --> 36:39.327
whatever that is.

36:39.329 --> 36:40.729
Well, we're not dead yet.

37:21.538 --> 37:24.307
I got it fair and square, all right?

37:25.842 --> 37:27.409
Yeah, well, if he'd wanted to offer more,

37:27.411 --> 37:29.510
then he should've offered more.

I just-I don't-I don't
need my team tempted

37:46.096 --> 37:47.862
- while I'm gone.
- Yeah.

37:47.864 --> 37:49.563
Don't get me wrong.
They're-they're hard workers.

37:49.565 --> 37:51.333
- I just want it to stay that way.
- Yeah.

37:51.335 --> 37:53.501
It's pretty simple. I'm
looking for a babysitter.

37:53.503 --> 37:56.104
Oh, yeah. No-no-no,
I-I know the drill.

37:56.106 --> 37:58.039
You know, been there. Paid for that.

37:58.041 --> 38:00.575
- (chuckles)
- Yeah.

38:00.577 --> 38:03.878
So, um, Kevin tells Rachel
that you guys are pretty close?

38:03.880 --> 38:05.347
Oh, yeah, ver-very close.

38:05.349 --> 38:06.847
He had some nice things to say about you.

38:06.849 --> 38:10.751
Yeah? Hey, well, if
they're nice, they're true.

38:10.753 --> 38:11.688
(chuckles)

38:15.358 --> 38:17.862
So, why'd you sell your company, Gilby?

38:20.496 --> 38:23.530
The question. (chuckles)

38:23.532 --> 38:25.467
(clears throat) Uh, good-good question.

38:25.469 --> 38:29.537
Um, seriously, it, uh, it was time.

38:29.539 --> 38:32.039
Yeah, okay, good. So, look, I'm
always looking for good people.

38:32.041 --> 38:33.641
Especially people I'm told I can trust.

38:33.643 --> 38:35.008
Oh, well, absolutely.

38:35.010 --> 38:36.911
Why don't we give this
a shot, see how it goes.

38:36.913 --> 38:39.012
Yeah, you got it, boss, yeah.

38:39.014 --> 38:40.648
All right, let me
introduce you to the team.

38:40.650 --> 38:42.916
Brad's an asshole, but
the rest are pretty good.

38:42.918 --> 38:44.818
Guys, everyone, listen
up. This is Gilby Smalls.

38:44.820 --> 38:47.088
He's gonna be overseeing
things for me while I'm gone.

38:47.090 --> 38:49.657
I thought you said that I was
gonna look after the group.

38:49.659 --> 38:51.793
Well, Brad, you really
need to focus on your work.

38:51.795 --> 38:53.661
And don't interrupt when
I'm talking to the group.

38:53.663 --> 38:56.764
You guys won't even know I'm here.

38:56.766 --> 38:58.733
Just don't make any mistakes.

38:58.735 --> 39:00.135
Gilby used to run his own media company,

39:00.137 --> 39:02.570
so don't be afraid to
ask him anything, really.

39:02.572 --> 39:04.438
Uh, what was the name of that company?

39:04.440 --> 39:06.574
Imagine, Inc.

39:06.576 --> 39:08.943
Imagine, Inc. is not a media company.

39:08.945 --> 39:10.545
Brad.

39:10.547 --> 39:12.679
Imagining, Inc.

39:12.681 --> 39:13.914
Imagining.

39:13.916 --> 39:15.883
Imagining, uh, Design, to be exact.

39:15.885 --> 39:18.887
Technically, The Imagining Design Company.

39:18.889 --> 39:22.757
Yeah, the old IDC, she was somethin'.

39:22.759 --> 39:26.594
Great. So, even though
I'm not here, I'm here.

39:26.596 --> 39:27.896
- All right?
- (clears throat)

39:27.898 --> 39:29.063
Let me show you the game room.

39:29.065 --> 39:30.867
Come on.

39:32.469 --> 39:34.568
Game? Game?

39:34.570 --> 39:36.072
We have a game room?

39:39.608 --> 39:40.809
(Gilby) Is this yoga?

39:40.811 --> 39:42.677
(woman) Hi. Shh.

39:42.679 --> 39:44.445
Hi.

39:44.447 --> 39:45.813
(Gilby) Hey.

39:45.815 --> 39:47.148
- Take off your shoes.
- (door slams shut)

39:47.150 --> 39:49.450
Oh, my God. Sorry. Sorry.

39:49.452 --> 39:51.119
Sorry.

39:51.121 --> 39:52.220
- Hi.
- (shoe thuds)

39:52.222 --> 39:54.188
- Oh.
- First time?

39:54.190 --> 39:56.858
No, I've yoga'd before.
I was yoga'ing yesterday.

39:56.860 --> 39:58.126
(instructor) Okay.

39:58.128 --> 40:00.061
Well, um, here you go.

40:00.063 --> 40:02.162
- I don't need a belt.
- It's okay.

40:02.164 --> 40:03.967
Go ahead.

40:08.972 --> 40:11.840
(clattering)

40:11.842 --> 40:16.878
(instructor) Try to use this
disruption in your meditation.

40:16.880 --> 40:19.349
Watch your thoughts and
see what comes up for you.

40:23.219 --> 40:24.952
Very nice.

40:24.954 --> 40:27.655
Remember to breathe.

40:27.657 --> 40:29.860
Beautiful job.

40:33.762 --> 40:35.063
Nice.

40:35.065 --> 40:36.530
(groans)

40:36.532 --> 40:38.900
Hey, hey-hey-hey,
don't force it.

40:38.902 --> 40:40.235
- It's not a competition.
- Yeah.

40:40.237 --> 40:42.237
Why don't you just rest in Child's Pose?

40:42.239 --> 40:43.838
No, thank you. I... Thank you.

40:43.840 --> 40:45.507
I appreciate it, but I can do this.

40:45.509 --> 40:48.675
Well, at least use the wall for support.

40:48.677 --> 40:51.045
I got it, okay?

40:51.047 --> 40:52.983
Child's Pose.

40:55.818 --> 40:57.117
I got it.

40:57.119 --> 40:59.586
(bones crunching, groans)

40:59.588 --> 41:00.755
(instructor) Oh, God, are you okay?

41:00.757 --> 41:03.191
Ow!

41:03.193 --> 41:05.260
I got it.

41:05.262 --> 41:07.064
I got it.

41:10.567 --> 41:11.965
Rachel.

41:11.967 --> 41:13.601
- Hi.
- Oh, hey.

41:13.603 --> 41:15.637
- Hey.
- I'm-I'm so glad you came.

41:15.639 --> 41:17.137
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:17.139 --> 41:18.873
- How's your back?
- Oh, it's fine.

41:18.875 --> 41:20.608
Only several hairline fractures.

41:20.610 --> 41:23.144
Oh, right, right. You should
probably get a body cast.

41:23.146 --> 41:24.979
- Yeah, exact...
- Help you out. You know, straighten you up.

41:24.981 --> 41:26.813
Sure, yeah, exactly.
Minor body cast injury.

41:26.815 --> 41:28.215
Yeah, no major body cast.

41:28.217 --> 41:30.150
(laughing)

41:30.152 --> 41:32.186
Rach, what a great class.

41:32.188 --> 41:33.287
Yeah, wasn't it amazing?

41:33.289 --> 41:35.657
It was. Yeah.

41:35.659 --> 41:37.992
- Gilby, this is Ann and Andy.
- Hi, brother.

41:37.994 --> 41:39.894
That was quite some flop in there.

41:39.896 --> 41:42.063
- Don't worry. It happens.
- Really? That's a relief.

41:42.065 --> 41:43.697
I've never seen it,

41:43.699 --> 41:46.066
but I'm sure it's happened to someone.

41:46.068 --> 41:47.568
Are you going to the
sweat lodge this weekend?

41:47.570 --> 41:48.836
(Rachel) I don't know.

41:48.838 --> 41:50.237
I'm thinking about it, you know?

41:50.239 --> 41:52.907
Maybe. You guys wanna grab a bite to eat?

41:52.909 --> 41:54.309
I'd love to. Yeah.

41:54.311 --> 41:56.077
- Oh, no, we can't.
- We can't.

41:56.079 --> 41:57.945
We're gonna be late for Reiki class.

41:57.947 --> 41:59.112
Breaky? What is that?

41:59.114 --> 42:00.648
It sounds dangerous.

42:00.650 --> 42:02.916
Reiki. You know, like chakras.

42:02.918 --> 42:04.918
What you just epically misaligned in there.

42:04.920 --> 42:07.088
Here, let me take a feel.

42:07.090 --> 42:09.624
- It's happening.
- I'm just gonna jump right in.

42:09.626 --> 42:10.958
- Raw food? Do you wanna get some?
- Anything.

42:10.960 --> 42:11.959
- Okay.
- Wow.

42:11.961 --> 42:14.095
We're gonna go, so...

42:14.097 --> 42:15.195
(Gilby) Pleasure was mine.

42:15.197 --> 42:16.898
Yeah.

42:16.900 --> 42:19.032
He's emitting a lot of
heat from down there.

42:19.034 --> 42:20.168
Mm-hmm.

42:20.170 --> 42:22.003
She better watch out.

42:22.005 --> 42:24.005
I think it's actually
really good for our marriage.

42:24.007 --> 42:25.840
You know, when you're
together all the time,

42:25.842 --> 42:27.809
it's so easy to get stuck in a rut,

42:27.811 --> 42:31.112
but, being apart makes you appreciate

42:31.114 --> 42:32.880
what you really have.

42:32.882 --> 42:33.947
Wow!

42:33.949 --> 42:36.284
You must really like wasabi.

42:36.286 --> 42:38.353
What is it they say?

42:38.355 --> 42:40.755
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

42:40.757 --> 42:42.293
(coughs)

42:44.159 --> 42:46.159
Are you okay?

42:46.161 --> 42:47.362
I'm fine. I'm fine.

42:47.364 --> 42:48.762
I'm sorry.

42:48.764 --> 42:51.199
I'm sorry. I just...

42:51.201 --> 42:53.400
That's so sad.

42:53.402 --> 42:55.737
- What's so sad?
- I don't know.

42:55.739 --> 42:58.072
I think your story, but I'm sensitive.

42:58.074 --> 42:59.907
- I'm very sensitive.
- Oh, wow!

42:59.909 --> 43:03.144
No, I think that's-I
think that's really great,

43:03.146 --> 43:05.179
you know, for a man to be so in touch

43:05.181 --> 43:06.847
with his core emotion.

43:06.849 --> 43:09.383
I wish Eric was more like that, you know?

43:09.385 --> 43:11.351
I keep trying to get him
to come to these classes,

43:11.353 --> 43:13.054
but he's just not interested.

43:13.056 --> 43:14.889
It would help him become more centered,

43:14.891 --> 43:17.090
and it would help us to connect
on a more spiritual level.

43:17.092 --> 43:18.392
Do you know what I mean?

43:18.394 --> 43:19.860
Yeah, definitely. Definitely.

43:19.862 --> 43:22.262
I always say, uh,

43:22.264 --> 43:23.764
if you're not growing together,

43:23.766 --> 43:24.898
you're growing apart.

43:24.900 --> 43:26.166
Exactly!

43:26.168 --> 43:27.702
Like the sweat lodge.

43:27.704 --> 43:30.972
I really wanna go, but, he will never go.

43:30.974 --> 43:35.108
You know, he's just...
Work is always first.

43:35.110 --> 43:38.679
I'm just tired of it.

43:38.681 --> 43:40.847
You can still go.

43:40.849 --> 43:41.983
Right.

43:41.985 --> 43:45.153
Am I gonna go by myself? No.

43:45.155 --> 43:48.021
Well, I don't know. I
was thinking about going.

43:48.023 --> 43:49.923
- Really?
- Yeah.

43:49.925 --> 43:52.092
- You would wanna go?
- Yeah, why not?

43:52.094 --> 43:54.228
(chuckles) Yeah, let's go.

43:54.230 --> 43:55.396
Sweat lodge. It sounds fun.

43:55.398 --> 43:57.231
You think so? Okay.

43:57.233 --> 43:59.200
All right, yeah. No, I would-I would...

43:59.202 --> 44:00.834
I'd really like that, Gilby.

44:00.836 --> 44:03.804
Oh, my God, look at that.
You really loved your food.

44:03.806 --> 44:07.275
I hate mine, so let me just give you that.

44:07.277 --> 44:09.276
Uh...

44:09.278 --> 44:11.112
Oh, I don't even know what...

44:11.114 --> 44:14.449
You just put it all-you
just put it all on there.

44:14.451 --> 44:17.050
Since you like that wasabi,
let me just get that on there.

44:17.052 --> 44:18.821
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

44:20.322 --> 44:22.058
Come on.

44:23.827 --> 44:25.295
(sighs)

44:29.498 --> 44:31.968
(dial tone)

44:52.755 --> 44:54.290
Mmm.

45:01.396 --> 45:03.130
(line ringing)

45:03.132 --> 45:04.465
- (Sharon) Hello?
- Hey.

45:04.467 --> 45:06.767
- Hey, it's me.
- Uh, look, Gilby,

45:06.769 --> 45:08.135
I don't really have
time to walk, right now.

45:08.137 --> 45:10.537
I-I-I just wanna say,
I've just been thinking,

45:10.539 --> 45:12.807
- and you were right.
- Okay. You know what?

45:12.809 --> 45:14.976
If this is some sort of a trick
to try to get back together,

45:14.978 --> 45:19.012
- I'm...
- No, no, it's-it's not.

45:19.014 --> 45:20.947
I should have been a better partner.

45:20.949 --> 45:25.755
You deserve that, and you
were right to leave me.

45:27.023 --> 45:31.358
Oh, well, thank you.

45:31.360 --> 45:34.061
No, thank you.

45:34.063 --> 45:36.164
(sighs)

45:36.166 --> 45:40.867
Look, I-I just really
want you to be happy.

45:40.869 --> 45:42.970
I really want you to be happy, too.

45:42.972 --> 45:45.405
- Get off the phone! I'm expecting a call.
- I'm, uh...

45:45.407 --> 45:47.541
- Is that your mother?
- Yeah, yeah.

45:47.543 --> 45:49.242
I'm taking care of her.

45:49.244 --> 45:53.380
She-she broke both her
hips stepping into traffic.

45:53.382 --> 45:55.383
The doctors think it's dementia.

45:55.385 --> 45:57.318
She-she must be having another episode.

45:57.320 --> 45:58.885
I-I have to go, okay?

45:58.887 --> 46:00.454
- Okay.
- Your mom both broke of her...

46:00.456 --> 46:02.222
Hello?

46:02.224 --> 46:05.025
That's such a weird relationship.

46:05.027 --> 46:06.526
They make phones with buttons now.

46:06.528 --> 46:07.528
Did you know?

46:07.530 --> 46:09.066
(May) I'm aware.

46:13.068 --> 46:14.936
Wow!

46:14.938 --> 46:17.204
It's so beautiful out here, isn't it?

46:17.206 --> 46:19.173
Yeah.

46:19.175 --> 46:21.041
Hi.

46:21.043 --> 46:23.077
- (Rachel) Hey.
- (Gilby) Hey.

46:23.079 --> 46:25.579
Love the face paint. Whose idea was that?

46:25.581 --> 46:28.481
Uh, we actually both did it on our own.

46:28.483 --> 46:29.950
Isn't it amazing?

46:29.952 --> 46:31.284
We're so much on the same energy field.

46:31.286 --> 46:33.387
We even think the same.

46:33.389 --> 46:35.222
Even, like, psychically,
we're on the same plane.

46:35.224 --> 46:37.090
Totally.

46:37.092 --> 46:38.492
Same plane. That's great.

46:38.494 --> 46:41.128
You can carry each other's baggage.

46:41.130 --> 46:43.099

46:44.967 --> 46:46.601
(Rachel) That was a good one.

46:46.603 --> 46:49.302
I don't think I get it.

46:49.304 --> 46:52.173
Well, stay warm.

46:52.175 --> 46:54.242
Thanks.

46:54.244 --> 46:56.177
(Gilby clears throat)

46:56.179 --> 46:57.644
Let's gather some wood, right?

46:57.646 --> 46:59.313
That seems too be the thing to do.

46:59.315 --> 47:02.316
(Rachel) We'll see you inside.

47:02.318 --> 47:04.822
- That was weird.
- Mmm.

- Oh, come on, you're kidding me.
- No, no, I'm serious.

50:38.701 --> 50:41.601
I realize I've been a-I've
been a really lousy sister

50:41.603 --> 50:45.206

wanna do something for him.

feel at all transformed?

50:57.686 --> 50:59.452
Transformed? Yes.

I-I've been completely
transformed into a cripple.

51:01.657 --> 51:03.389
No, I'm serious.

51:03.391 --> 51:05.626
I mean, you can't be exposed
to such powerful experiences

51:05.628 --> 51:08.195
without being affected a little, right?

51:08.197 --> 51:10.798
- Does burned count as affected?
- Are you making fun of me?

51:10.800 --> 51:12.633
- You're totally making fun of me.
- I'm-I'm sorry.

51:12.635 --> 51:14.568
I'm sor... I-I mean, I guess.

51:14.570 --> 51:16.302
It was very intense.

51:16.304 --> 51:18.873
You know, maybe I was
affected without realizing it.

51:18.875 --> 51:20.708
Oh, come on, your burn's not that bad.

51:20.710 --> 51:21.876
What do you know?

51:21.878 --> 51:24.648
What are you now, a-a burn specialist?

51:28.918 --> 51:30.751
This place is ridiculous.

51:30.753 --> 51:32.519
Thanks.

51:32.521 --> 51:34.822
Okay, wait. Is this FDA approved?

51:34.824 --> 51:37.324
Or is this a-a Broken Wing product?

51:37.326 --> 51:39.626
Okay, that's...
Ah! Ow-ow-ow!

51:39.628 --> 51:41.695
- Oh, oh.
- Oh, no, no, no! Stop, please.

51:41.697 --> 51:43.563
- Ow!
- Don't be such a baby.

51:43.565 --> 51:45.331
Please, no. No more! No more!

51:45.333 --> 51:47.901
Didn't your dad tell you never
to cry in front of a girl?

51:47.903 --> 51:51.405
No, actually, I didn't have a father.

51:51.407 --> 51:53.574
Did he-did he pass away
before you were born?

51:53.576 --> 51:54.708
No... Oh, no.

51:54.710 --> 51:56.342
No, I-I never met my father.

51:56.344 --> 51:57.711
I don't know anything about him.

51:57.713 --> 52:00.246
How could you not know
anything about your father?

52:00.248 --> 52:04.584
Um, well, my mom was still
on her free love trip.

52:04.586 --> 52:06.954
(sighs)

52:06.956 --> 52:09.322
Well, maybe that's it.

52:09.324 --> 52:11.458
I mean, maybe that's your revelation.

52:11.460 --> 52:14.260
Gilby, you never had a-a
male figure to look up to.

52:14.262 --> 52:16.697
Uh, you probably have identity issues.

52:16.699 --> 52:19.833
- I can't identify with that.
- I'm being serious.

52:19.835 --> 52:23.704
Did you have any male role model?

52:23.706 --> 52:25.940
I looked up to Han Solo.

52:25.942 --> 52:28.275
I meant someone you knew.

52:28.277 --> 52:30.411
No.

52:30.413 --> 52:32.213
Huh? Well, there you go.

52:32.215 --> 52:33.713
I mean, maybe you should look into it.

52:33.715 --> 52:35.416
That's all I'm saying.

52:35.418 --> 52:36.916
Somehow, I don't think it's that simple.

52:36.918 --> 52:38.318
I-I don't know.

52:38.320 --> 52:39.586
I think everything happens for a reason.

52:39.588 --> 52:40.920
And maybe-maybe that's why we met,

52:40.922 --> 52:43.224
so you could have this revelation.

52:43.226 --> 52:46.726
Trust me. I've got really good
instincts about this kinda thing.

52:46.728 --> 52:48.394
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

52:48.396 --> 52:50.396
Well, maybe you're wrong.

52:50.398 --> 52:53.467
Or maybe you just needed to
hear this at the right time,

52:53.469 --> 52:56.003
from the right person.

52:56.005 --> 52:57.704
I'm just saying.

52:57.706 --> 53:01.777
Here, let me-let me go wash these for you.

53:04.012 --> 53:06.280
You should probably burn them.

53:06.282 --> 53:14.021
♪♪

53:14.023 --> 53:15.956
(Gilby) I was worried.
You said it was important.

53:15.958 --> 53:17.858
Don't overreact. I just wanted to talk.

53:17.860 --> 53:20.260
Okay, okay, sorry. Yeah, hi.

53:20.262 --> 53:21.829
Hi. How are you?

53:21.831 --> 53:23.563
I'm good. I'm good. Come on.

53:23.565 --> 53:25.298
Can you please tell me what this is about?

53:25.300 --> 53:27.001
I mean, I thought, like,
your mother died or something.

53:27.003 --> 53:29.470
- How can you even say that?
- You know, I mean, sorry.

53:29.472 --> 53:31.639
- Like, maybe your cat.
- Gilby.

53:31.641 --> 53:32.840
Okay, no one died.

53:32.842 --> 53:35.309
Just, you know, levels of concern.

53:35.311 --> 53:36.709
- Hi.
- Hi.

53:36.711 --> 53:38.345
Hi.

53:38.347 --> 53:40.481

- Yeah.

53:40.483 --> 53:42.048
You look good.

53:42.050 --> 53:44.584
Thanks, thanks. You, too.

53:44.586 --> 53:46.586
Heard about your job. Congratulations.

53:46.588 --> 53:47.854
Oh, thank you.

53:47.856 --> 53:50.594
Yeah, well, yeah. Yes, it's going well.

53:52.527 --> 53:54.862
Seems like you really have it all together.

53:54.864 --> 53:58.065
Yeah, I wouldn't go that far, but...

53:58.067 --> 53:59.936
(chuckles)

54:01.971 --> 54:04.438
Um...

54:04.440 --> 54:05.805
(sighs)

54:05.807 --> 54:10.677
I just feel like I was impatient with you,

54:10.679 --> 54:13.313
or selfish.

54:13.315 --> 54:14.682
That's not true.

54:14.684 --> 54:17.985
- I was a real jerk.
- Well...

54:17.987 --> 54:19.920
No, I'm just... I'm just kidding.

54:19.922 --> 54:22.488
I-I-I,
um...

54:22.490 --> 54:25.092
I mean, I did the right thing,

54:25.094 --> 54:28.695
because we were-we just
were really stagnant.

54:28.697 --> 54:30.430
You feel that way, right?

54:30.432 --> 54:32.032
Yeah. No, I know.

54:32.034 --> 54:34.934
It's, really... It's fine.

54:34.936 --> 54:37.104
I mean, let's just forget about it.

54:37.106 --> 54:40.574
You know, what's the point
of digging up the past?

54:40.576 --> 54:43.376
Yeah.

54:43.378 --> 54:46.112
I guess I just wanted
to say I'm sorry, Gilby.

54:46.114 --> 54:48.382
I'm sorry, too.

54:48.384 --> 54:50.918
(chuckles)

54:50.920 --> 54:53.787
I missed you.

54:53.789 --> 54:56.724
I'm glad we can be friends.

54:56.726 --> 54:59.362
Yeah, yeah, me, too.

55:08.536 --> 55:10.137
You're drinking now?

55:10.139 --> 55:12.442
What? It's a nightcap.

55:19.148 --> 55:20.713
Can I talk to you for a minute?

55:20.715 --> 55:22.749
Oh, honey, I don't need
a lecture right now.

55:22.751 --> 55:24.485
No, nothin' like that.

55:24.487 --> 55:27.824
I-I-I just wanna ask
you about some stuff.

55:29.125 --> 55:33.159
- What stuff?
- Well...

55:33.161 --> 55:34.628
about my father.

55:34.630 --> 55:36.630
Oh, not this, again.

55:36.632 --> 55:38.164
How many times do I have to tell you?

55:38.166 --> 55:40.166
Do you know how many guys I slept with?

55:40.168 --> 55:42.068
I have no idea.

55:42.070 --> 55:43.637
How can that be?

- Here you go. Thank you.

- Sharon, I...
- Come on.

01:22:49.596 --> 01:22:52.397
Can I help with this? Turn the music on.

Music... I don't know
how to work the god...

Birthday" and a smile?

- Yes.
- And why is that?

Because Gilby is gay.

01:23:47.154 --> 01:23:48.352

What kind of degenerate are you?

- Kind of.

about your company, Gilby?

No, I was never more honest in my life

01:24:37.805 --> 01:24:39.338

I need you to get out.

Hey, how are you?

01:31:23.877 --> 01:31:27.044
I'm good. I'm good.

01:31:27.046 --> 01:31:30.147
I haven't seen you around yoga, lately.

01:31:30.149 --> 01:31:32.584
Oh, yeah, I don't-I don't do that anymore.

01:31:32.586 --> 01:31:35.553
It was just a-a phase, I guess.

01:31:35.555 --> 01:31:37.155
Oh, really?

01:31:37.157 --> 01:31:38.990
Yeah.

Yeah, all that seeking stuff.

01:31:42.061 --> 01:31:45.162
Maybe I just had too much time on my hands.

01:31:45.164 --> 01:31:47.568
Actually, maybe all I needed was a job.

01:31:49.936 --> 01:31:52.102
So, what are you doing here?

01:31:52.104 --> 01:31:55.040
Uh, I'm not really sure, to be honest.

01:31:55.042 --> 01:31:58.646
Um, everything ended so weird.

01:32:00.079 --> 01:32:04.081
Rachel... I'm really sorry.

01:32:04.083 --> 01:32:05.916
Oh, come on.

01:32:25.037 --> 01:32:29.074
I mean, y-you really changed me.

01:32:29.076 --> 01:32:31.045
You were a good friend.

01:32:39.252 --> 01:32:42.821
and I had no idea who you were.

01:32:42.823 --> 01:32:46.090
Hey, for what it's worth,
I thought it was special.

01:32:46.092 --> 01:32:47.726
I think you're romanticizing

01:32:47.728 --> 01:32:49.827
something that was never really there.

01:32:49.829 --> 01:32:52.296
Wow.

01:32:52.298 --> 01:32:54.299
Wow.

01:32:54.301 --> 01:32:55.799
I never thought about it that way,
