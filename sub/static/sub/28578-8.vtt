WEBVTT

00:11.225 --> 00:12.945
Welcome to night one of the first

00:12.970 --> 00:14.679
- Democratic presidential debate.
- _

00:15.729 --> 00:16.883
Good evening. I'm Lester Holt,

00:16.907 --> 00:18.140
the last living good man.

00:18.165 --> 00:20.047
Also joining me, Savannah Guthrie,

00:20.072 --> 00:23.107
Jose Diaz-Balart, Rachel
Maddow, and Chuck Todd,

00:23.170 --> 00:25.250
who, even next to 20
presidential candidates,

00:25.275 --> 00:26.474
seems like an ego-maniac.

00:26.499 --> 00:28.601
Hey, if everyone's saying
you're worse than shit,

00:28.626 --> 00:29.729
you're doin' something right.

00:29.753 --> 00:30.985
Let's meet the candidates.

00:31.010 --> 00:33.739
Audience, please withhold your
"Is this the best we can dos"

00:33.764 --> 00:35.457
until the end.

00:35.482 --> 00:36.548
Mayor, De Blasio.

00:36.573 --> 00:39.957
I'm Mayor Bill De Blasio,
and if I have one weakness,

00:39.982 --> 00:41.406
it's that I work too little.

00:41.431 --> 00:43.608
I'm Tim Ryan. I can't stop blinking.

00:43.633 --> 00:45.800
And every second feels like an hour.

00:45.825 --> 00:48.522
Julian Castro asked to
reserve his introduction time

00:48.547 --> 00:50.181
to later destroy Beto O'Rourke.

00:50.206 --> 00:51.680
- Wait, what?
- Senator Booker?

00:51.705 --> 00:53.619
I'm Cory Booker. If
you don't vote for me,

00:53.644 --> 00:55.311
I'll come to your home,
knock on your door,

00:55.335 --> 00:56.789
and ask, "Why not?"

00:56.814 --> 00:59.358
I'm Elizabeth Warren,
the healthy salad place

00:59.383 --> 01:02.025
that you should eat at,
but Chipotle is right there.

01:02.050 --> 01:03.583
I'm Beto O'Rourke. A bunch of people

01:03.608 --> 01:05.397
told me to run, and
I'm still not sure why.

01:05.422 --> 01:09.023
I'm Senator Amy Klobuchar,
and I'm not the monster...

01:09.048 --> 01:10.569
my former assistants

01:10.593 --> 01:11.715
make me out to be.

01:11.740 --> 01:14.472
I actually have a lot of good ideas.

01:14.497 --> 01:18.227
_

01:18.251 --> 01:20.327
_

01:20.352 --> 01:21.367
Jesus Christ!

01:21.392 --> 01:22.838
And there's crazy Russian plant,

01:22.862 --> 01:24.815
possibly a retired
Canadian football player,

01:24.840 --> 01:26.240
and bald guy.

01:26.265 --> 01:29.255
I am so confident, I will
attempt to speak Spanish

01:29.280 --> 01:30.812
without ever having studied it.

01:30.837 --> 01:34.192
Estado unedos es moy bueno e guapo.

01:34.217 --> 01:36.866
You won, Julian. Now stop!

01:36.891 --> 01:39.197
Julian, even I think
you're being too harsh,

01:39.222 --> 01:42.223
and I once made an
intern swallow a battery.

01:42.248 --> 01:45.003
Oh, man! Everyone here is really smart.

01:45.028 --> 01:46.623
Jesus, I'm kicking everyone's ass,

01:46.648 --> 01:47.860
and I still can't stop shaking.

01:47.884 --> 01:50.525
Hey, whoever's in charge of the audio

01:50.550 --> 01:52.876
is definitely the
dumbest one here, right?

01:52.901 --> 01:56.008
He's gonna get the reputation
of being the dumb guy.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.593
No doubt about it.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.051
- Welcome to night 2.
- _

01:59.076 --> 02:01.652
Different ingredients, same
burrito you found in the trash.

02:01.677 --> 02:03.844
Let's meet the candidates.

02:03.869 --> 02:06.072
I'm Marianne Williamson,
and I want to be

02:06.097 --> 02:08.872
the first quack president
of the United States, baby.

02:08.898 --> 02:10.484
I think it's safe to skip the next two

02:10.508 --> 02:11.999
unless the audience objects.

02:12.594 --> 02:13.740
Moving on.

02:13.765 --> 02:15.311
I'm Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.834
I'm so committed to being
president that I've allowed

02:17.859 --> 02:20.693
my city to descend into
a den of racial animus.

02:20.718 --> 02:21.838
Shouldn't you go back there?

02:21.863 --> 02:24.378
Yeah, I'm gonna leave
Miami for South Bend.

02:24.403 --> 02:25.568
Oh-ho-kay, bitch.

02:25.593 --> 02:26.692
Please don't call me bitch.

02:26.717 --> 02:27.784
Vice President Biden?

02:27.809 --> 02:30.247
I promise that as president,

02:30.272 --> 02:33.138
no pile of shit will go un-stepped in.

02:33.163 --> 02:34.684
I'm Bernie Sanders.

02:34.709 --> 02:37.320
My first action as president

02:37.345 --> 02:39.144
will be to clean up the White House.

02:39.169 --> 02:42.135
Pine-Sol the floors, put
Formula 409 in the tubs,

02:42.160 --> 02:44.160
and Windex all the windows.

02:44.185 --> 02:46.731
You are not going to be able to breathe

02:46.756 --> 02:47.987
in there for a month!

02:48.012 --> 02:49.885
I'm Senator Kamala Harris.

02:49.910 --> 02:52.440
I have a black father, Indian mother,

02:52.465 --> 02:53.525
and I'm a women.

02:53.550 --> 02:57.029
I'm a tasty turkey leg in
a trap ready to catch Trump.

02:57.054 --> 02:58.453
Okay, let me see who's left.

02:58.555 --> 02:59.654
And we're good.

02:59.679 --> 03:02.334
Joe Biden, I'm gonna
bus you into the forest

03:02.359 --> 03:03.458
and leave you there.

03:03.483 --> 03:04.523
Get him, Kamala!

03:04.548 --> 03:06.006
All right, look, look, look.

03:06.030 --> 03:09.764
Look, look, look,
look, look. Folks, look.

03:09.943 --> 03:11.543
Oh, that's my time.

03:11.568 --> 03:13.970
If you need someone
to calm tensions between

03:13.995 --> 03:16.514
Joe and Kamala, I am not the guy.

03:16.539 --> 03:18.295
Let's focus on the real issue.

03:18.320 --> 03:21.220
A cat's in my car and
refuses to unlock the door.

03:21.245 --> 03:23.244
Why isn't anyone asking
Marianne Williamson's

03:23.269 --> 03:24.688
position on busing?

03:24.713 --> 03:27.415
If Jane was not in the picture,

03:27.516 --> 03:31.552
I would send a crystal
to Marianne Williamson

03:31.654 --> 03:35.410
with a note saying, "From
your secret admirer."

03:35.435 --> 03:37.435
Everybody come on out. Everyone.

03:37.460 --> 03:39.493
You too, Tim Ryan, let's go!

03:39.518 --> 03:40.918
I want each of you to listen to me.

03:40.943 --> 03:43.002
Next debate, you need to
get your shit together.

03:43.027 --> 03:44.387
You're running for president here.

03:44.412 --> 03:45.944
- Sorry.
- Sorry, baby!

03:45.969 --> 03:48.323
It's okay. Joe, I think we're good.

03:48.348 --> 03:50.225
If you want, we can all
pretend you never ran.

03:50.250 --> 03:51.579
Get you a nice podcast.

03:51.604 --> 03:54.718
Are you kidding?
I'm setting myself up for 2024!

03:54.743 --> 03:58.579
From all of us here at
NBC News, God help us all.

04:00.593 --> 04:03.894
Karma isn't real, losers.

04:03.919 --> 04:05.418
Oh!

04:07.644 --> 04:09.710
♪ Three white people on a couch ♪

04:09.735 --> 04:12.269
♪ It's "Fox and Friends" ♪

04:12.294 --> 04:15.039
You're a good person,
so nothing you do is bad!

04:15.064 --> 04:16.329
- It's "Fox and Friends"!
- _

04:16.353 --> 04:18.070
Well, the the Intergovernmental Panel

04:18.095 --> 04:20.588
on Climate Change just
released another report

04:20.613 --> 04:23.111
saying climate change is real. What?!

04:23.136 --> 04:24.578
Climate change isn't real!

04:24.603 --> 04:26.336
I know because the mountain on my

04:26.361 --> 04:28.835
computer background is
still covered in snow.

04:28.860 --> 04:31.889
If the climate is changing,
how come every day this year

04:31.914 --> 04:33.380
has been the hottest one on record?

04:33.405 --> 04:36.169
Speaking of hotty-boom-bodies,
President Trump

04:36.194 --> 04:39.128
is delivering comments on
the climate report right now.

04:39.153 --> 04:41.230
Calm down. The Earth isn't heating up.

04:41.255 --> 04:43.554
The sun's just bloated from a big lunch.

04:43.579 --> 04:45.245
Mister President, why are you drenched?

04:45.270 --> 04:47.370
I just watched "The Perfect Storm".

04:47.395 --> 04:48.582
That's not how movies work.

04:48.607 --> 04:49.839
Fuck you!

04:49.864 --> 04:51.297
- Today was a hot one,
- _

04:51.322 --> 04:54.553
and that means President Trump
looked absolutely disgusting.

04:54.578 --> 04:55.778
According to sources,

04:55.803 --> 04:57.543
the sweat wanted to roll down his face,

04:57.568 --> 04:59.737
but there was just too
much sweat already there,

04:59.762 --> 05:01.595
so it retreated into his eardrums.

05:01.620 --> 05:04.274
Is President Swamp-ass
finally feeling the effects

05:04.299 --> 05:05.398
of climate change?

05:05.423 --> 05:06.455
You're...

05:06.480 --> 05:07.847
President...

05:07.872 --> 05:09.037
Swamp...

05:09.062 --> 05:10.604
Eh...

05:10.629 --> 05:12.629
It's too hot, forget it.

05:16.077 --> 05:17.843
What's your strategy
for the debate tonight?

05:17.868 --> 05:19.635
I'm thinking of jumping
on a bunch of stuff.

05:19.660 --> 05:21.426
I'm going to keep
announcing policies that

05:21.451 --> 05:23.539
for some reason people call unlikable.

05:23.564 --> 05:25.166
I'm just gonna say
what everyone else says,

05:25.190 --> 05:26.656
but vaguer and louder.

05:26.681 --> 05:28.747
That was my idea, fuck-nuts!

05:28.772 --> 05:31.673
Hey, who's that guy over there
whispering to his saltines?

05:32.839 --> 05:34.084
Pretty good. That's a good batch.

05:34.108 --> 05:36.258
- Oh, it's Bernie. Poor guy.
- Yeah.

05:36.283 --> 05:37.350
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:37.375 --> 05:38.377
Isn't he a front runner?

05:38.402 --> 05:40.333
- That doesn't sound right.
- It's still early!

05:40.358 --> 05:42.124
Look, I feel bad for the old man.

05:42.149 --> 05:44.389
I mean, he's got to be, what,
ten months older than I am?

05:44.418 --> 05:45.838
I'll go keep him company.

05:45.863 --> 05:47.896
Hey, Bernie, what's shakin'?

05:47.921 --> 05:51.611
This economy is completely
rigged against working people.

05:51.636 --> 05:53.674
Jesus, save it for the debate.

05:53.699 --> 05:56.330
I'm sorry. It's just that the economy

05:56.355 --> 05:59.451
is completely tilted against
everyday working class...

05:59.476 --> 06:01.858
Just hey, why don't
you come hang with us?

06:01.883 --> 06:04.089
Cory's showing us a
picture of his girlfriend,

06:04.114 --> 06:06.756
and, I swear to God, it's
the first Google result

06:06.781 --> 06:07.993
for "hot girlfriend."

06:08.018 --> 06:10.896
Uh, I don't belong over there
with you combed-hair types.

06:10.921 --> 06:12.754
You're a front runner, Bernie.

06:12.779 --> 06:14.946
Maybe it's time to
start looking the part.

06:14.971 --> 06:18.239
Get a haircut, buy a suit
you didn't find in a railyard,

06:18.264 --> 06:21.362
scrape off the lozenges
stuck to your necktie.

06:25.009 --> 06:28.143
I would, but I have to
do my pre-debate ritual

06:28.168 --> 06:31.339
where I go through all 75
punch cards in my wallet.

06:31.364 --> 06:34.599
Yesus H. Kripes.

06:35.902 --> 06:37.401
Has anyone seen the President?

06:37.504 --> 06:38.669
- No.
- Nope.

06:40.673 --> 06:43.128
I thought it might be
cooler under the table,

06:43.153 --> 06:45.921
but Pompeo's ankles
are like space heaters.

06:45.946 --> 06:48.864
Hey, is global warming real,
or is it just a scary story

06:48.889 --> 06:51.325
you tell your kids so they
ask to sleep at their mom's?

06:51.350 --> 06:54.896
Unlike my shit wife's
"film career", it's real.

06:54.921 --> 06:57.520
Okay, who doesn't believe
global warming is real?

06:58.410 --> 07:00.479
So, the four dumbest people in the room?

07:00.504 --> 07:01.689
Okay, it's real.

07:01.714 --> 07:03.047
Oh, what's the difference?

07:03.072 --> 07:05.472
By the time it kicks in,
we'll be dead or living in

07:05.497 --> 07:08.953
space mansions having zero
gravity bunga bunga parties.

07:08.978 --> 07:11.378
How would you get enough
leverage to perform?

07:11.403 --> 07:13.324
Velcro, you idiot.

07:13.349 --> 07:15.149
You think I didn't think of that?!

07:15.174 --> 07:16.974
Let him go. It's not worth it.

07:18.453 --> 07:20.253
Oh! The ice cream truck!

07:20.278 --> 07:21.711
Oh, thank God!

07:24.503 --> 07:26.376
Ice Cream! Huh?

07:26.401 --> 07:27.962
Hello, Donald.

07:27.986 --> 07:30.941
Mad Dog Mattis? Sad Dog McMaster?

07:30.966 --> 07:33.143
Third Dog Kelly? What are doing here?

07:33.168 --> 07:35.635
We hit save on our
tell-alls to warn you about

07:35.660 --> 07:38.094
the biggest threat to
our national security.

07:38.196 --> 07:39.896
Dashboard hula girls coming to life

07:39.921 --> 07:41.952
and yanking your steering
wheel into a ravine?

07:41.977 --> 07:43.176
Climate change.

07:43.201 --> 07:45.618
Oceans are rising, and, had you listened

07:45.643 --> 07:49.059
to briefings, you'd know
naval bases are on the water.

07:49.084 --> 07:51.818
And if troops launching
World War Three while wearing

07:51.843 --> 07:54.888
water wingies doesn't trouble
you, take a look at this.

07:54.913 --> 07:55.989
What's that...

07:56.014 --> 07:57.229
a big sweet roll?

07:57.254 --> 07:59.091
That, sir, is your face.

07:59.116 --> 08:01.471
If global warming continues
at its current rate,

08:01.496 --> 08:02.828
here it is in five years.

08:02.853 --> 08:05.472
Ten years. And twenty years.

08:05.497 --> 08:06.796
Aah! My face!

08:06.821 --> 08:08.301
I'd only be body-hot!

08:08.326 --> 08:11.270
Sir, if you don't do something
about climate change and fast,

08:11.295 --> 08:12.506
you will be the most uncomfortable,

08:12.530 --> 08:14.584
disgusting person on
the face of this Earth.

08:14.609 --> 08:15.908
More disgusting than...

08:15.933 --> 08:18.340
Chris Christie, yes,
even Chris Christie.

08:21.926 --> 08:24.894
I'm Chuck Todd, and NBC
won't give me a parking space.

08:24.919 --> 08:27.568
Tonight, the Democratic
candidates compete to represent

08:27.593 --> 08:29.532
the party against
President Donald Trump.

08:29.557 --> 08:32.205
They will be given one minute
to spout poll-tested buzzwords

08:32.230 --> 08:33.866
that I will give zero pushback on.

08:33.892 --> 08:34.981
Let's meet the candidates.

08:36.130 --> 08:37.506
Sorry I am late.

08:37.530 --> 08:39.698
I left my ThinkPad at the pharmacy.

08:39.722 --> 08:41.099
Hey! Pump your brakes, chief.

08:41.124 --> 08:42.988
This is for presidential
candidates only.

08:43.013 --> 08:46.605
Hello, operator, I am
a presidential candidate.

08:46.630 --> 08:48.303
Yeah, there's no way a
presidential candidate

08:48.327 --> 08:49.485
has relish on his shirt.

08:49.510 --> 08:51.187
That's why I went to the pharmacy,

08:51.212 --> 08:52.410
to get a new shirt.

08:52.435 --> 08:54.357
And please welcome
the Senator from Vermont.

08:54.381 --> 08:56.181
You know this guy... Bernie Sanders.

08:56.206 --> 08:58.956
That's me! Now you let me on that stage,

08:58.981 --> 09:01.253
or you're getting a
knuckle sandwich, pal,

09:01.278 --> 09:02.677
heavy on the relish.

09:02.702 --> 09:04.601
Senator Bernie Sanders? Is he here?

09:04.859 --> 09:07.515
He's probably at home
watching the movie,

09:07.540 --> 09:09.517
"The Socialism Network".

09:10.697 --> 09:11.730
Sorry.

09:11.755 --> 09:13.655
I know why you're doing this!

09:13.757 --> 09:17.625
Because there's a profit
motive in our prison system!

09:19.239 --> 09:20.372
Watcha doing, Dad?

09:20.397 --> 09:23.017
Thinking about how freaking
huge Andre the Giant was?

09:23.042 --> 09:25.943
I'm just thinking about how
to combat climate change...

09:25.968 --> 09:28.925
and I do my best thinking
sitting in an idling car

09:28.950 --> 09:30.715
inside an idling plane...

09:30.740 --> 09:32.136
on an idling boat.

09:32.161 --> 09:33.653
I don't know if I can

09:33.677 --> 09:34.909
solve this issue.

09:34.934 --> 09:37.646
There's no easy fix like
running a full page ad

09:37.671 --> 09:39.791
saying climate change
should get the death penalty.

09:39.816 --> 09:41.636
When you're not feeling up to it,

09:41.661 --> 09:45.478
remember that you're doing
it for the next generation.

09:45.503 --> 09:48.008
Oh, no, I'm doing this
for something important...

09:48.033 --> 09:50.066
me feeling slightly more comfortable.

09:50.091 --> 09:52.326
Right, but you're also
doing it for your children.

09:52.351 --> 09:54.113
You're putting words in my mouth.

09:54.138 --> 09:55.872
Just say, "You can do it, Dad."

09:55.897 --> 09:57.662
- You can do it, Dad!
- You can do it, Dad!

09:57.687 --> 09:59.052
He's totally doing it for us.

09:59.077 --> 10:00.143
No, I'm not!

10:00.168 --> 10:01.602
- And now, a message from
- _

10:01.626 --> 10:03.422
the President of the United States.

10:03.447 --> 10:08.065
My fellow overheated Americans,
for years, the party I hijacked

10:08.090 --> 10:11.190
as a vanity project refused
to accept the science

10:11.215 --> 10:12.690
behind global warming.

10:12.715 --> 10:15.663
Today, that changes
because I've been getting

10:15.688 --> 10:18.704
really frickin' sweaty,
and I'm sick of it!

10:18.729 --> 10:21.162
Okay, let's go to our first caller.

10:21.710 --> 10:23.009
We don't have callers?

10:23.034 --> 10:24.600
That's a mistake!

10:25.260 --> 10:28.787
I'm here with volatile
tech-freak Elon Musk

10:28.812 --> 10:32.752
to encourage all Americans
to embrace electric vehicles.

10:32.777 --> 10:35.511
Come on, let's take a look inside!

10:35.613 --> 10:36.913
Oh, sorry for the mess.

10:36.938 --> 10:38.738
You can push the cups out of the way.

10:38.840 --> 10:40.304
Wow, folks!

10:40.329 --> 10:42.095
You can see right through the glass!

10:42.120 --> 10:44.487
Now, why isn't it going
vroom, vroom, vroom?

10:44.512 --> 10:46.199
This is an electric car.

10:46.224 --> 10:47.958
It's just as fast as a gas one,

10:47.983 --> 10:50.850
but even more future and cool for me.

10:50.875 --> 10:53.212
Whoa, no stops at gas stations?

10:53.237 --> 10:56.030
That's the best part.
You pick up a Gatorade,

10:56.055 --> 10:59.219
off-brand gummy worms in
a bag sealed with a staple,

10:59.244 --> 11:01.727
squeeze by a rack of dirty
sodas to hit the john.

11:01.752 --> 11:03.827
You can still go to the
gas station to get, like,

11:03.852 --> 11:07.141
a Sprite or lighter to
light your cannabis joints.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.625
Forget it. Let me know when you

11:08.650 --> 11:11.804
crack the code on
gas-powered electric cars.

11:14.686 --> 11:16.485
This old vagrant says he knows you.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.329
Sorry for not calling ahead.

11:18.354 --> 11:20.813
My assistant's getting her hip replaced.

11:20.915 --> 11:23.176
So you need my help
to improve your look?

11:23.201 --> 11:25.700
You always look so handsome,

11:25.725 --> 11:27.263
and I look like a ragamuffin.

11:27.288 --> 11:30.810
Meals on Wheels won't stop
chasing my campaign bus.

11:30.835 --> 11:34.424
Hmmm, in 2024, it would be
easier to beat a socialist

11:34.449 --> 11:36.649
than a political dynamo
like Julian Castro.

11:36.674 --> 11:39.658
Heh? You have to speak at
90 decibels into this ear

11:39.683 --> 11:40.763
at this angle.

11:40.788 --> 11:42.221
Uh, sure, I'll help you.

11:42.246 --> 11:43.812
Looking classy is simple.

11:43.837 --> 11:46.392
Every equinox, I
re-lacquer my whole body

11:46.417 --> 11:48.183
and induce a coma so I get five weeks

11:48.208 --> 11:49.673
of rejuvenating bedrest.

11:49.698 --> 11:50.930
You sleep in a bed?

11:50.955 --> 11:54.200
Not three mismatched sofa
cushions laid end to end?

11:54.225 --> 11:57.269
Right. I also rotate my
teeth every 6,000 bites.

11:57.294 --> 11:59.094
Slow down, Jesse Owens.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.217
I gotta take some notes
here on my ThinkPad.

12:02.833 --> 12:04.866
God damnit, it's still updating.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.791
Gonna be about 300 minutes.

12:08.062 --> 12:10.250
The meat people are
making the planet hot,

12:10.275 --> 12:13.698
so I need the country to
stop eating cows nose to anus

12:13.723 --> 12:15.422
and start eating veggie burgers.

12:15.447 --> 12:18.133
Cory Booker just showed up
because he's a vegetarian.

12:18.158 --> 12:20.492
Actually, I'm a vegan,
and it would be unethical

12:20.517 --> 12:23.051
to not support the President's
leadership on this issue.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.742
As Gandhi once said...

12:24.767 --> 12:26.398
Always with the Mahatma!

12:26.423 --> 12:27.889
Let's get this over with.

12:31.317 --> 12:33.361
What is happening?!

12:33.386 --> 12:35.306
Oh, my...

12:35.331 --> 12:37.265
Aaaaah!

12:41.888 --> 12:44.054
Uh, side-table burger...

12:44.079 --> 12:47.213
I had a terrible dream I
had to talk to Cory Booker.

12:47.633 --> 12:49.796
♪ One percent of one
percent of one percent ♪

12:49.821 --> 12:52.622
♪ of one percent of one
percent of one percent of one ♪

12:52.647 --> 12:53.647
♪ Percent of one ♪

12:55.497 --> 12:57.972
Sorry, doctor says
the mucus is too close

12:57.997 --> 12:59.730
to my heart so they can't operate.

12:59.755 --> 13:00.964
On the trail, you're...

13:00.989 --> 13:02.100
♪ One percent of one percent of ♪

13:02.124 --> 13:03.256
Bernie, listen!

13:03.281 --> 13:05.135
It's important to show
voters that you don't

13:05.160 --> 13:06.460
eat every meal with a spoon.

13:06.485 --> 13:09.997
Obviously, I can still eat
sandwiches with a spoon.

13:10.022 --> 13:11.932
You are one odd-duck animal.

13:11.957 --> 13:14.098
The next thing is you need
to pull back the accent.

13:14.123 --> 13:15.503
Just talk like a computer.

13:15.528 --> 13:18.347
I told you the god damn
thing is still updating!

13:18.372 --> 13:19.551
Why is it so hot?!

13:19.575 --> 13:21.896
Here's the key. Just be agreeable.

13:21.921 --> 13:23.691
Stop saying what you think

13:23.716 --> 13:26.380
and start saying what
they think back to them.

13:26.405 --> 13:28.691
So I should stop cutting off everyone

13:28.716 --> 13:30.583
mid-sentence to shout, "You're wrong!"

13:30.608 --> 13:32.997
Ah, fine, but if this goes kaput,

13:33.022 --> 13:35.022
I get all the fruit in your fridge.

13:37.151 --> 13:38.984
Huh. I wonder who sent
a soaking wet package

13:39.009 --> 13:40.036
from the White House.

13:40.061 --> 13:41.094
- Aah!
- Aah!

13:41.119 --> 13:43.997
I can't eat anymore of
those goddamn peanuts!

13:44.022 --> 13:45.641
I can't be seen with you!

13:45.666 --> 13:47.600
Quick, put a tailored women's blazer on.

13:47.625 --> 13:49.246
No one can find out we met,

13:49.271 --> 13:51.215
or Hannity will die of a broken heart.

13:51.240 --> 13:52.972
I'm embracing the green lifestyle,

13:52.997 --> 13:54.494
and my body is rejecting it

13:54.519 --> 13:56.121
like the fiftieth packing peanut.

13:56.146 --> 13:57.146
How do you do it?

13:57.171 --> 13:59.342
I don't live that green a lifestyle.

13:59.367 --> 14:01.581
I eat burgers, ride in SUVs.

14:01.606 --> 14:03.493
You two-faced hypocrite!

14:03.518 --> 14:05.985
You're probably not even
committing white genocide.

14:06.010 --> 14:08.536
I promise I'm committing white genocide.

14:08.561 --> 14:11.167
I just recognize that it
takes collective action

14:11.192 --> 14:13.269
to move the needle on climate change.

14:13.294 --> 14:15.067
So I can live my life

14:15.092 --> 14:16.873
while still supporting
the Green New Deal.

14:16.898 --> 14:18.631
You're saying I can cool the planet,

14:18.656 --> 14:21.223
solve my sweating problem,
and I don't have to give up

14:21.248 --> 14:22.714
my natural spring water toilet?

14:24.472 --> 14:27.073
I am supporting the Green New Deal,

14:27.098 --> 14:30.732
which will halt global warming,
watershed moment,

14:30.757 --> 14:33.255
blah, blah, blah, and, most importantly,

14:33.280 --> 14:36.958
stop forcing me to change my
undershirt every three hours

14:36.983 --> 14:39.818
because it turned from
white to canary yellow.

14:39.843 --> 14:43.301
And I was just about to
support the Green New Deal!

14:43.326 --> 14:45.517
- We both know that's a lie.
- Okay.

14:45.542 --> 14:47.992
There's no way any Republican
will go along with this.

14:48.017 --> 14:50.485
Climate change is real, and
it's all our fault, folks.

14:50.510 --> 14:52.185
- Thousands of scientists are saying it.
- _

14:52.209 --> 14:54.710
If that many scientists told
me to stop resting my head

14:54.735 --> 14:57.914
behind tires I would, but
so far only three have.

14:57.939 --> 15:00.459
It feels weird to support the
president and Mark Ruffalo.

15:00.484 --> 15:02.641
I feel like I'm speeding
down the highway in reverse.

15:02.666 --> 15:05.444
We all knew one day the
president would save the planet.

15:05.469 --> 15:07.746
- But I assumed he'd do it by piloting
- _

15:07.771 --> 15:09.982
the Statue of Liberty
right into an alien

15:10.007 --> 15:11.232
spaceship's landing dock.

15:11.257 --> 15:13.357
He's a god, Hannity!

15:13.382 --> 15:16.456
Tie my shoes together,
push me down an escalator,

15:16.481 --> 15:19.015
and let me assist him from the clouds.

15:19.040 --> 15:20.606
I am done here!

15:21.333 --> 15:22.995
Ha! I was right.

15:23.020 --> 15:25.950
There was no way Bernie
Sanders was showing up

15:25.975 --> 15:28.372
to a pharmaceutical industry mixer.

15:28.397 --> 15:30.512
Just be patient. He said he'd be here.

15:30.537 --> 15:32.303
I'm not waiting here any longer.

15:32.328 --> 15:35.350
The CEO of Pfizer is
drunkenly playing hacky sack

15:35.375 --> 15:36.407
with his checkbook.

15:36.432 --> 15:38.717
Ladies and gentleman,
the honorable Senator

15:38.742 --> 15:40.478
from Vermont, Bernie Sanders.

15:41.760 --> 15:43.416
He's gorgeous!

15:43.441 --> 15:45.637
Senator... you look beautiful.

15:45.662 --> 15:47.604
Yeah, sure. Please tell me my table

15:47.629 --> 15:49.620
is not where the air is blowing.

15:49.645 --> 15:51.922
It dries up my gums, and I can't eat.

15:51.947 --> 15:55.133
Remember, be agreeable and
say what they want to hear.

15:55.158 --> 15:57.025
Shall we?

15:58.354 --> 16:00.675
I mean, we got to split
up these tech companies.

16:00.700 --> 16:03.348
Kids... they need to stop
watching "The Social Network"

16:03.373 --> 16:05.846
and start watching
"The Socialism Network".

16:06.896 --> 16:08.816
Yeah, how's it feel? Sucks, huh?

16:08.841 --> 16:11.709
This Green New Deal has
been driving me bananas.

16:11.734 --> 16:12.843
What's more pressing,

16:12.868 --> 16:15.757
human extinction or bipartisan civility?

16:15.782 --> 16:17.514
Scientists say we have 12 years before

16:17.539 --> 16:19.693
humanity is wiped out,
so what's the rush?

16:19.718 --> 16:20.983
That's three Olympics away!

16:21.008 --> 16:22.776
Bernie, what do you think?

16:22.878 --> 16:24.732
Be agreeable.

16:24.757 --> 16:26.190
Hmm...

16:26.215 --> 16:28.836
And for Pete's sake, taste
your food before you salt it.

16:28.861 --> 16:31.162
That way you know if it even needs salt.

16:31.187 --> 16:33.207
I agree with you guys.

16:33.232 --> 16:34.496
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

16:34.521 --> 16:38.345
The private sector is
perfectly capable of...

16:38.370 --> 16:40.304
s-solving climate change.

16:40.329 --> 16:41.672
- Uh-huh!
- Uh-huh!

16:41.697 --> 16:43.984
I was just about to
say what Bernie said.

16:44.009 --> 16:46.109
Shut up, Cory. Bernie, I must say,

16:46.134 --> 16:48.663
you keep this up, the Democratic Party

16:48.688 --> 16:51.191
might just have to
board this crazy train.

16:51.216 --> 16:52.482
I'll toast to that.

16:52.507 --> 16:53.617
- To Bernie!
- To Bernie!

16:55.867 --> 16:57.787
I'd also like to toast to Bernie.

16:57.812 --> 17:00.762
Cory, you know when someone
wants something so bad

17:00.787 --> 17:03.193
so that's the only reason
you don't give it to them?

17:04.586 --> 17:07.753
90 degrees yesterday, 80 degrees today.

17:07.779 --> 17:10.032
Should be a breezy 70 by tomorrow,

17:10.058 --> 17:12.015
then we can shitcan this Green New Deal.

17:12.040 --> 17:14.903
Good news, President
Awesome, the G-20 nations

17:14.928 --> 17:17.821
are putting together a
ceremony in your honor.

17:17.847 --> 17:20.337
I'm not surprised. Has
anyone in world history

17:20.362 --> 17:22.478
done more to solve
their sweating problem?

17:22.502 --> 17:26.892
And there's two young men
who'd like to say "thank you".

17:26.916 --> 17:30.886
Come on in guys. Don't be shy.

17:30.911 --> 17:33.222
"Dear Mister President,"

17:33.247 --> 17:35.879
thank you for stopping global warming.

17:35.904 --> 17:37.537
You are a good president.

17:37.562 --> 17:40.221
Did you always want to be president?

17:40.246 --> 17:42.197
Love, Donald Junior Trump.

17:42.222 --> 17:44.490
"P.S. What time is it there?"

17:44.515 --> 17:46.579
- "Dear Mister Pres..."
- Shut the hell up, Eric.

17:46.604 --> 17:48.256
Kellyanne, what is this?

17:48.281 --> 17:50.915
You put future generations
ahead of yourself,

17:50.940 --> 17:53.752
and now every child will
want to hug your leg.

17:53.777 --> 17:54.942
Yaayyy.

17:56.225 --> 18:00.482
The most important policy
we can have is unity.

18:00.507 --> 18:03.979
Now I can take a few questions,
but, please, don't get too close

18:04.004 --> 18:06.164
to the Mic. That foam
thing's a Petri dish.

18:06.189 --> 18:09.123
Hey, why'd you say
all that lame stuff on tape?

18:09.148 --> 18:10.235
- Yeah!
- That sucked!

18:10.260 --> 18:11.693
What are these kids talking about?

18:11.718 --> 18:12.850
They're supposed to like me.

18:14.108 --> 18:18.377
And another thing. 99% of Americans

18:18.402 --> 18:21.963
are dependent upon government
and believe that they are

18:21.988 --> 18:24.571
entitled to healthcare,
food, pre-schools

18:24.596 --> 18:27.152
not owned by Walmart, you name it.

18:27.177 --> 18:28.477
- Yeah!
- You said it, Bernie!

18:28.502 --> 18:32.223
If you don't make $150,000 a year,

18:32.248 --> 18:35.075
you should not be allowed to vote.

18:35.100 --> 18:37.067
Bernie! Bernie!

18:37.092 --> 18:39.453
I agree with what Bernie said.

18:39.478 --> 18:41.231
Shut up, Cory!

18:41.256 --> 18:42.956
What the hell was I thinking?

18:42.981 --> 18:45.426
I got applause from one
guy without a man bun,

18:45.451 --> 18:47.116
and I just went nuts.

18:48.011 --> 18:50.099
Don't come in here unless

18:50.132 --> 18:53.176
you're Scott Baio with a trench
coat full of cool watches.

18:53.201 --> 18:54.201
Are you okay?

18:54.226 --> 18:55.637
Did you remember that you accidentally

18:55.661 --> 18:58.026
kept the XFL offices
operational ten years

18:58.051 --> 18:59.250
after the league folded?

18:59.275 --> 19:01.942
It's cool outside, but
I still started sweating.

19:01.967 --> 19:03.522
How is that possible?

19:03.547 --> 19:05.280
Sometimes we start sweating because of

19:05.305 --> 19:06.455
our feelings on the inside.

19:06.480 --> 19:07.480
Not me, of course.

19:07.505 --> 19:08.950
I've scooped those
out like pumpkin guts.

19:08.974 --> 19:11.787
Tell me how to control
my feelings on the inside.

19:11.812 --> 19:12.826
I beg you!

19:12.851 --> 19:14.510
- So, uh...
- Uhhh...

19:14.535 --> 19:17.052
You can control your feelings...

19:17.077 --> 19:19.577
With this magic...

19:19.602 --> 19:20.701
Chandelier!

19:22.184 --> 19:23.484
Great. How's it work?

19:23.509 --> 19:25.392
Uh, whenever you're
feeling worried, just...

19:25.417 --> 19:26.444
Shake it!

19:26.469 --> 19:28.187
You guys are life savers.

19:28.212 --> 19:30.626
Can someone get some
chandelier clippers?

19:31.974 --> 19:34.774
I'm ruined, and it's all your fault!

19:34.799 --> 19:35.938
Hold on there, Mister.

19:35.963 --> 19:37.163
Everything you said was right.

19:37.188 --> 19:39.163
The only thing you left
out is that people who own

19:39.188 --> 19:41.190
fewer than five horses
should be sterilized.

19:41.215 --> 19:43.949
I don't believe that,
and the only reason I said

19:43.974 --> 19:47.430
any of those things was
because of your bad influence.

19:47.455 --> 19:49.198
Dad, is everything all right?

19:49.223 --> 19:52.225
I heard loud voices
like in a gangster film!

19:52.250 --> 19:53.682
Of course it is, Tagg.

19:53.707 --> 19:55.725
Daddy and Uncle Bernie are just talking.

19:55.750 --> 19:57.983
Your daddy is a real piece of shit.

19:58.008 --> 19:59.708
Holy Store Brand Baloney!

19:59.733 --> 20:01.182
Bernie, it's time to leave.

20:01.207 --> 20:03.358
Tagg, please walk
Bernie down the stairs,

20:03.383 --> 20:05.015
through the library, past the kitchen,

20:05.040 --> 20:06.974
around the second kitchen, past the spa,

20:06.999 --> 20:09.633
down the steps, through
the garden to his car.

20:10.141 --> 20:12.141
_

20:12.172 --> 20:14.672
_

20:14.696 --> 20:19.396
_

20:20.610 --> 20:24.011
As long as I have the
chandelier, I'll be fine.

20:24.113 --> 20:26.433
And now children from around

20:26.458 --> 20:30.084
the world unite in song
in honor of Mr. Trump.

20:30.186 --> 20:31.519
Oh, yes!

20:31.621 --> 20:33.742
♪ If we want to save the world ♪

20:33.767 --> 20:35.634
- ♪ And for Mother Earth's health ♪

20:53.932 --> 20:55.354
I'm flying back to the White House

20:55.378 --> 20:57.188
to pack up my shit before he gets back.

20:57.213 --> 20:59.467
Excuse me, pardon me, out of my way!

20:59.492 --> 21:01.159
I'll strike you in the throat!

21:01.184 --> 21:04.551
♪ So think of the children
instead of yourselves ♪

21:04.653 --> 21:07.085
Stttooopppp!

21:07.110 --> 21:09.210
Shut up! Shut Up!

21:09.235 --> 21:11.269
I don't care about you kids.

21:11.294 --> 21:14.248
I care about my skin not
making a peeling sound

21:14.273 --> 21:16.562
every time I get out of a leather chair!

21:16.587 --> 21:18.553
I'm pulling out of the Green New Deal!

21:18.578 --> 21:20.143
Oh, no!

21:20.168 --> 21:22.746
I'm replacing it with the Green No Deal!

21:22.771 --> 21:24.737
If you're not blowtorching
your way through

21:24.762 --> 21:27.827
Glacier National Park, we're
gonna bury you underground

21:27.852 --> 21:29.122
until you're coal.

21:29.147 --> 21:31.589
Enjoy the heat!

21:37.230 --> 21:39.537
- After President Trump fell unconscious,
- _

21:39.562 --> 21:42.222
the deeply offended
G-20 leaders cheered on

21:42.247 --> 21:44.579
the children as they
drew messages of hope

21:44.604 --> 21:46.010
on the President's face.

21:46.035 --> 21:48.302
The president's sweat
caused the ink to run,

21:48.327 --> 21:51.328
so they all agreed to
tattoo the images instead.

21:52.443 --> 21:53.443
- Bernie!
- Mr. Sanders!

21:53.468 --> 21:54.634
- What were you thinking?
- Is this the end

21:54.658 --> 21:55.687
of your campaign?

21:55.712 --> 21:57.771
If it is, I will retire

21:57.796 --> 22:01.013
and make it my duty to
tell people on ferries

22:01.038 --> 22:02.519
not to lean on the railings.

22:02.544 --> 22:05.945
There's nothing you can't see
if you take one step back, folks.

22:05.970 --> 22:07.802
- Bernie!
- Bernie!

22:08.083 --> 22:10.711
You're pretty lucky your
son has extensive experience

22:10.736 --> 22:12.896
getting tattoos of dicks
removed from his face.

22:12.921 --> 22:14.843
Boys, the Green New Deal is toast,

22:14.868 --> 22:16.923
and my face is melting like butter.

22:16.948 --> 22:19.969
Maybe you can put the
butter on the toast?

22:19.994 --> 22:22.116
Eric, we're gonna go
ahead and reinstate that

22:22.141 --> 22:23.507
"one sentence per day" policy.

22:23.532 --> 22:26.065
I need to stop sweating,
but I want to do it

22:26.090 --> 22:28.531
without leaving even a
single scrap of planet

22:28.556 --> 22:29.857
for the next generation.

22:29.882 --> 22:31.916
Wait a second. Does the Green New Deal

22:31.941 --> 22:33.792
specify how the money is allocated?

22:33.817 --> 22:35.415
Don, it's a spending bill.

22:35.440 --> 22:37.440
It's like the government
passed out in a whorehouse

22:37.465 --> 22:40.112
and everyone has until daylight
to root through its pockets.

22:42.784 --> 22:45.727
The one day I forget my tailbone pillow.

22:45.752 --> 22:47.819
Room for one more human man?

22:47.844 --> 22:50.044
I'm sorry about what

22:50.069 --> 22:52.168
I said, Mitt, and for calling you

22:52.193 --> 22:54.171
a piece of blue-blood shit
in front of your son, Tagg.

22:54.195 --> 22:56.234
His bedwetting has returned,

22:56.259 --> 22:58.394
but luckily we never took
off the plastic sheets.

22:58.419 --> 22:59.585
How do I do it, Mitt?

22:59.610 --> 23:02.911
How do I look like a nominee
and stay true to myself?

23:02.936 --> 23:04.880
You know, when I was
governor of Massachusetts,

23:04.905 --> 23:07.593
I betrayed my principles
when I passed Romneycare.

23:07.618 --> 23:09.718
Sure, it guaranteed our
residents would never die

23:09.743 --> 23:11.114
due to lack of health insurance,

23:11.139 --> 23:13.340
but it nearly killed
my presidential chances.

23:13.365 --> 23:15.968
I vowed to never betray
my principles again,

23:15.993 --> 23:17.514
and look at me now.

23:17.539 --> 23:20.039
I won the Senate Punctuality Award.

23:20.064 --> 23:22.140
Well, I shared it with
John Thune, but still.

23:23.190 --> 23:25.811
What in General Mills'
Rice Chex was that?

23:25.836 --> 23:27.336
Thank God you heard that, too.

23:27.361 --> 23:29.928
I thought my sinuses collapsed again.

23:30.108 --> 23:32.141
Thanks to that Green New Deal cash,

23:32.166 --> 23:34.387
this mega air-conditioning
unit will cool

23:34.412 --> 23:36.312
the entire White House grounds.

23:36.337 --> 23:39.324
Whether inside or outside,
you shalt not sweat.

23:39.349 --> 23:40.716
You forgot the best part.

23:40.741 --> 23:42.540
It's terrible for the environment.

23:42.565 --> 23:44.644
A/C begins in three...

23:44.669 --> 23:47.469
... two... one.

23:49.000 --> 23:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

23:56.189 --> 23:59.367
Should we be worried about
that plume of CO2 gas?

23:59.392 --> 24:01.965
In my experience, nothing
bad's ever happened

24:01.990 --> 24:03.756
involving the word "plume".

24:03.781 --> 24:04.862
_

24:04.887 --> 24:06.887
You're watching a massive
air-conditioning unit

24:06.912 --> 24:08.959
cool the White House
as it shoots deadly gas

24:08.984 --> 24:10.078
- into the atmosphere.
- _

24:10.103 --> 24:13.202
Meanwhile, the average global
temperature is already rising.

24:13.227 --> 24:14.239
Bad news day.

24:14.264 --> 24:16.123
But let's get to the important point.

24:16.148 --> 24:19.629
How will horses dying en masse
affect the electoral horse race?

24:19.654 --> 24:22.557
Coming up, analysis from a
former Reagan speechwriter.

24:22.582 --> 24:23.858
Oh, no.

24:23.883 --> 24:26.637
If it gets too hot, my
tomato plants are done for.

24:26.662 --> 24:30.098
Alright, I'm gonna go
stop that air conditioner.

24:30.123 --> 24:33.434
Give me some of your pomade
so I can get past security.

24:33.459 --> 24:35.503
Bernie, you don't need that pomade.

24:35.528 --> 24:37.072
You've demonstrated
that you can hang with

24:37.096 --> 24:39.851
the mainstream political
class by hanging with me,

24:39.876 --> 24:41.809
a quarter billionaire whose religion

24:41.834 --> 24:43.588
was invented after baseball.

24:43.613 --> 24:44.646
You be yourself.

24:44.671 --> 24:46.236
I'll help you get through security.

24:48.005 --> 24:50.361
You know when the temperature
is like, you're not sweating,

24:50.386 --> 24:51.746
but you're worried about sweating?

24:51.771 --> 24:53.497
Yeah, you want me to turn up the A/C?

24:53.522 --> 24:55.822
If you're getting up.

25:00.118 --> 25:02.219
Sick plume!

25:02.691 --> 25:04.523
Oh, hello, jackbooted pigs.

25:04.548 --> 25:06.882
I'm the 99% here to
confront the President.

25:06.907 --> 25:09.093
Americans should have
clean water for their bongs.

25:09.118 --> 25:11.759
Also, as is customary
for a government moocher,

25:11.784 --> 25:13.016
I've pooped my pants.

25:13.041 --> 25:14.334
Isn't that Mitt Romney?

25:14.359 --> 25:15.759
That guy fired my uncle!

25:15.784 --> 25:17.133
Let's kick his ass!

25:17.236 --> 25:18.301
Ow, oh, ow!

25:18.326 --> 25:20.448
Your grandchildren will
thank you for this, Mitt.

25:20.473 --> 25:22.782
All 84 of them.

25:22.952 --> 25:25.253
Brrr. It's getting a little chilly.

25:25.278 --> 25:27.517
Mind throwing another tire on the fire?

25:27.542 --> 25:29.861
We're out, so Styrofoam it is.

25:29.886 --> 25:31.798
Stop right there, mister!

25:31.823 --> 25:33.744
Ha! What do you want, Crazy Bernie?

25:33.769 --> 25:35.825
To leech off my air-conditioning unit?

25:35.850 --> 25:38.747
Maybe if you stopped
looking for handouts,

25:38.772 --> 25:41.207
you'd work hard enough
to get taxpayers to buy

25:41.232 --> 25:42.739
you a giant air-conditioner.

25:42.764 --> 25:45.116
Donald, you and I have a lot in common.

25:45.141 --> 25:47.737
We both support gun rights,
our base would rather die

25:47.762 --> 25:49.495
than see a woman president,
we both remember

25:49.520 --> 25:52.078
the jitterbug, but
mainly we are outsiders

25:52.103 --> 25:53.857
who wound up in the mainstream.

25:53.882 --> 25:55.614
And it's been uncomfortable.

25:55.639 --> 25:59.505
But we can still pursue
our goals while sticking

25:59.530 --> 26:01.120
to our outsider principles.

26:01.145 --> 26:04.266
How do I do that and
still stop my sweating?

26:04.291 --> 26:07.865
Okay, hear me out. Mesh suits.

26:08.353 --> 26:09.719
Sorry, Bernie.

26:09.744 --> 26:11.318
This is just slightly easier for me,

26:11.343 --> 26:12.875
so it's kind of a no-brainer.

26:15.116 --> 26:17.817
Oh, it finished updating just in time.

26:17.842 --> 26:22.069
I'm gonna hack into the A/C
and shut it down for good.

26:22.094 --> 26:24.882
Bernie, your laptop
is glowing white hot.

26:24.907 --> 26:29.266
Do you know if a '94
ThinkPad can run on the X-P?

26:29.291 --> 26:30.924
She's gonna blow!

26:32.627 --> 26:35.428
ThinkPad, looks like you're
going to be rebooting in Heaven,

26:35.453 --> 26:36.721
which is, of course, a made up place

26:36.745 --> 26:37.985
only an idiot would believe in.

26:49.668 --> 26:51.335
- Whoa!
- Bernie, I'm mad

26:51.360 --> 26:54.438
you blew up my air conditioner,
but I'm happy to finally see

26:54.463 --> 26:55.762
a mushroom cloud.

26:55.787 --> 26:57.909
And I'm happy that you've accelerated

26:57.934 --> 27:01.256
this country's decline
so that a class revolution

27:01.281 --> 27:03.947
is basically a foregone conclusion.

27:03.972 --> 27:06.016
Aww, my face is beet red,

27:06.041 --> 27:08.796
and it's not just the
Freon sizzling my skin.

27:08.821 --> 27:10.754
Dad, you're missing it!

27:11.083 --> 27:14.151
After Mass-Extinction-Gate,
the President won't have

27:14.176 --> 27:16.981
the political capital necessary
to solve the climate crisis.

27:17.006 --> 27:19.306
Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders
is back at the front

27:19.331 --> 27:20.497
- of the Democratic pack.
- _

27:20.522 --> 27:23.802
I wonder if he's had time
lately to watch the movie

27:23.827 --> 27:26.203
"The Social... The Socialism Network"?

27:26.228 --> 27:28.588
If I hadn't said it wrong, it
would have gotten a big laugh.

27:29.998 --> 27:33.120
Aww. That Freon did
a number on my throat.

27:33.145 --> 27:35.588
Should have never scraped
off those lozenges.

27:35.613 --> 27:38.048
Bernie, that was amazing what ya did.

27:38.073 --> 27:39.283
- You're my hero.
- We all agree you did good.

27:39.307 --> 27:41.194
- Nice job, fucko.
- Why don't you come

27:41.219 --> 27:43.063
get plastered with us
in Kamala's hotel room?

27:43.088 --> 27:44.955
I stole a prisoner's toilet wine.

27:47.115 --> 27:50.194
Thanks, guys, but I
still got a few dozen more

27:50.219 --> 27:51.571
punch cards to go through.

27:51.596 --> 27:53.629
Now, let's see here.
I've got an unused ticket

27:53.654 --> 27:56.733
to Staten Island Ferry,
beer parlor two-for-one,

27:56.758 --> 28:00.690
Walter Matthau's business card,
a half a dozen half dollars?

28:00.715 --> 28:02.133
That's why this thing's so heavy.

28:03.042 --> 28:06.063
The important thing is
you tried to save the world

28:06.088 --> 28:07.421
for us, Dad.

28:07.446 --> 28:09.545
I don't care if you
live or die, but thanks.

28:09.570 --> 28:11.866
Dad, you're not sweating
like a hog anymore!

28:11.891 --> 28:14.106
- You did it!
- I sure did,

28:14.131 --> 28:16.317
and all it took was blowing
up half the White House

28:16.342 --> 28:17.997
to get this great cross-breeze going.

28:18.022 --> 28:19.054
Whew!

28:19.079 --> 28:21.410
Whoa! Shit ton of
squirrels in here, Dad.

28:21.435 --> 28:22.535
Don't worry, Don.

28:22.560 --> 28:24.827
They'll be extinct in no time.

29:22.943 --> 29:24.175
Trump!
