00:36.459 --> 00:38.622
You get paid every week.

00:38.622 --> 00:40.582
But you gotta put a week in the hole.

00:40.582 --> 00:41.415

00:41.415 --> 00:42.454
That's okay.

00:42.454 --> 00:45.520

but I'm gonna have you shadow

00:46.569 --> 00:48.244

00:48.244 --> 00:49.457
Get familiar with the job.

00:53.279 --> 00:54.619
Hello?

00:54.619 --> 00:55.532
Yeah.

We got a new employee here.

00:57.284 --> 01:00.166
I want you to take him around

01:00.166 --> 01:02.269
His name is Randy Glass.

01:03.102 --> 01:03.935
Okay.

01:06.078 --> 01:06.911
Alright.

01:06.911 --> 01:08.407
There's absolutely no
smokin' in the building

01:08.407 --> 01:10.145
'cause the alarms will go off.

01:10.145 --> 01:11.228
All right?

01:15.545 --> 01:16.378
Let's see.

01:23.694 --> 01:25.719
You'll start at 8 AM.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.219
Lunch is at 11 AM.

01:28.234 --> 01:29.919
You get two fifteen minute breaks.

01:29.919 --> 01:32.894
One before lunch, one after lunch.

01:32.894 --> 01:33.741
All right?

01:33.741 --> 01:34.580
- Okay.

01:34.580 --> 01:36.094
- Any questions?

01:36.094 --> 01:37.382
- Nope, I'll be here.

01:37.382 --> 01:38.416
All right.

01:38.416 --> 01:39.770
Welcome aboard.

01:39.770 --> 01:40.729
- Thank you.

01:40.729 --> 01:42.147
Got 18.

01:42.147 --> 01:44.885
Hey, I was too close for y'all to win.

01:44.885 --> 01:46.545
Y'all might as well pay me now.

01:47.378 --> 01:48.211
Hey shut up.

I'm gonna grab the
rebound off of your miss.

02:06.495 --> 02:07.954
Ah, bro.

02:07.954 --> 02:08.846
Hey, man, bet's off, bro.

02:08.846 --> 02:10.044
You did that on purpose.

02:10.044 --> 02:11.782
Hey, no I didn't, man.

02:11.782 --> 02:12.615
Bet's still on, man.

02:12.615 --> 02:13.573
You gotta keep rollin'.

02:13.573 --> 02:14.406

02:14.406 --> 02:15.796
- Man, naw, if that's the
case, Randy gonna come

02:15.796 --> 02:16.629

02:16.629 --> 02:17.833
Come on, Randy Ran.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.823
- Naw, man, he can't come in for you.

02:19.823 --> 02:20.656
Naw, man, you can't-

02:20.656 --> 02:22.209
- Naw, bring him in.

02:22.209 --> 02:23.509
He ain't even warm up, yet.

02:23.509 --> 02:24.342
Bet's still on.

02:24.342 --> 02:25.483

02:25.483 --> 02:26.783

02:26.783 --> 02:27.616

02:27.616 --> 02:29.456

02:35.959 --> 02:36.792

02:50.786 --> 02:52.119

02:53.133 --> 02:54.048
Three and out or keep shootin'?

02:54.048 --> 02:55.137
- Three and out, man.

03:07.810 --> 03:09.477
That's 20.

03:12.698 --> 03:14.215
21, that's game.

03:14.215 --> 03:16.063
- Naw, man, we play 24 now.

03:16.063 --> 03:17.424
- What?

03:17.424 --> 03:18.588
- 24 in honor of Kobe Bryant.

03:18.588 --> 03:20.015
It's 24 now.

03:20.015 --> 03:21.600
- Yes, sir.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.585
- All right, 24.

03:31.422 --> 03:33.601
Shit!

03:33.601 --> 03:34.434
Damn.

03:37.038 --> 03:38.365
All right.

03:38.365 --> 03:39.490
23.

03:39.490 --> 03:40.602
24 and I win, yeah?

03:40.602 --> 03:43.263
- Yeah, if you miss, you
go back at 8 instead of 15.

03:43.263 --> 03:45.263
- Let me get this going.

03:46.177 --> 03:47.888
Yes, sir.

03:47.888 --> 03:49.803
Kobe!

03:49.803 --> 03:50.636
- Man, you suck, man.

03:50.636 --> 03:51.469
- Man, you garbage, man.

03:51.469 --> 03:52.777
You weak ass.

03:52.777 --> 03:53.694
- Whatever.

03:54.750 --> 03:55.583
You all right, bro?

03:55.583 --> 03:56.416
How's your ankle?

03:56.416 --> 03:57.249
I'm straight.

03:57.249 --> 03:58.401
Good lookin', man.

03:58.401 --> 04:00.263
Hey, man, go play again, I'll bet on you.

04:00.263 --> 04:01.096
- Hey, man.

04:01.096 --> 04:04.838
Y'all just got beat by a
dude in dress shoes, dawg.

04:05.671 --> 04:06.504
I got next.

04:06.504 --> 04:07.337
- I need a break here.

04:07.337 --> 04:08.238
Plus I don't got no hoopin' shoes.

04:08.238 --> 04:09.071
- All right, man, I'll catch you later.

04:09.071 --> 04:11.799
All right, bro.

04:21.324 --> 04:25.484
Hey, man, which one you like?

04:25.484 --> 04:27.823
- I like this one, but, I can't afford it.

04:27.823 --> 04:30.647
I need somethin' cheaper.

04:30.647 --> 04:32.487
- Hey, man, you should get what you want.

04:32.487 --> 04:34.762
- Uh, yeah, but I wanna
use it for Lyft driving.

04:34.762 --> 04:36.384
So I need somethin' cheap.

04:36.384 --> 04:38.474
Somethin' I can pay off quick.

04:38.474 --> 04:40.437
No car note, more profit.

04:40.437 --> 04:42.362
- Okay, Lyft, so.

04:42.362 --> 04:43.260
It's gotta be four door.

04:43.260 --> 04:44.093
- Yeah.

04:44.093 --> 04:46.408
- And it can't be more than 15 years old.

04:46.408 --> 04:47.241
Come with me.

04:47.241 --> 04:48.422
I got somethin' just for you.

04:48.422 --> 04:50.089
Thank you.

04:54.759 --> 04:58.176
- Cheapest I got and it's ready for work.

04:59.049 --> 05:00.647
How much?

05:00.647 --> 05:01.480
- 8,000.

05:01.480 --> 05:03.409
Cash or finance?

05:03.409 --> 05:04.242
- Cash.

05:05.870 --> 05:08.260
My credit is kinda terrible.

05:08.260 --> 05:10.449
I can have that in about three months?

05:10.449 --> 05:12.899
- Man, can you come back sooner?

05:12.899 --> 05:14.960
- I mean, I could try.

05:14.960 --> 05:16.310
I can try.

05:16.310 --> 05:18.096
- All right, I'ma get you my number, man.

05:18.096 --> 05:18.929
Call me.

05:18.929 --> 05:21.262
I wanna get you on the road.

05:23.055 --> 05:24.342
All right, thank you.

05:24.342 --> 05:25.530
Appreciate it, man.

05:46.857 --> 05:48.607
Who do you think you are?

05:48.607 --> 05:50.732
You act like you don't give a damn!

05:50.732 --> 05:53.396
That ain't how things go around here.

05:53.396 --> 05:54.994
Well,
if I don't get paid,

05:54.994 --> 05:55.860
I'm not workin'.

05:55.860 --> 05:57.834
That's how I work around here.

05:59.222 --> 06:01.704
Well I'm
changin' your pay rate back.

06:01.704 --> 06:02.537
- See?

06:02.537 --> 06:03.942
That's why I'm not comin'
in early and I'm not doin'

06:03.942 --> 06:05.156
no more doubles.

06:05.156 --> 06:06.352
- You can't do that.

06:06.352 --> 06:07.810
You can't just do on the system

06:07.810 --> 06:09.131
and change your pay rate like that.

06:09.131 --> 06:11.192
- Well, you didn't do it so I did.

06:11.192 --> 06:12.616
- I did put it in.

06:12.616 --> 06:13.449
- A dime?

06:14.531 --> 06:16.157
A dime.

06:16.157 --> 06:17.344
That ain't no damn raise.

06:17.344 --> 06:18.729
- That's what your evaluation said.

06:18.729 --> 06:21.812
A dime?
- That's what I put in.

06:21.812 --> 06:26.469
- All the stuff I'm doin'
here and that's what I get?

06:26.469 --> 06:28.044
Let me go.

06:28.044 --> 06:31.668
Let me go before I do somethin' bad.

06:31.668 --> 06:32.679
- Well, I'm callin' the cops.

06:32.679 --> 06:33.854
I'm pressin' charges.

06:33.854 --> 06:35.937
I quit.

06:38.801 --> 06:41.301
Come in my office.

06:50.380 --> 06:52.554
She's not gettin' away with this.

06:52.554 --> 06:54.189
Shoot.

06:54.189 --> 06:57.704
Who she think she is,
gonna change her pay rate?

06:57.704 --> 06:59.194
Man, it's gonna take a couple weeks for me

06:59.194 --> 07:01.779
to go back and find out what she did.

07:01.779 --> 07:04.154
I don't know how she thinks
she's gonna get away with that.

07:04.154 --> 07:07.256
Man, that's what the
District Manager makes.

07:07.256 --> 07:08.794
Man, look at all this.

07:08.794 --> 07:10.140
She's been shoppin' on here.

07:10.140 --> 07:10.973
What?

07:10.973 --> 07:13.056
What's this Fashion Nova?

07:13.904 --> 07:17.631
Randy, I'm movin' you up to prep tables.

07:17.631 --> 07:18.828
I'ma take the prep person and move him

07:18.828 --> 07:20.495
up to Shift Manager.

07:21.356 --> 07:23.214
You think you can handle that?

07:23.214 --> 07:24.547
- Yeah, I think so.
-  You been watchin'?

07:24.547 --> 07:25.631
- Yeah, I been watchin'.

07:25.631 --> 07:27.128
Good.

07:27.128 --> 07:28.878
It pays 75 cent more.

07:30.391 --> 07:32.816
It's a little bit more
work and you still gotta

07:32.816 --> 07:34.766
do your other job.

07:34.766 --> 07:36.253
Just for a little bit.

07:43.714 --> 07:45.874
Here, take this water, man.

07:48.513 --> 07:50.324
Get rid of her cousin, too,
'cause they're stealin'

07:50.324 --> 07:52.074
off the register.

07:52.074 --> 07:55.491
So I'm gonna need you to wait tables too.

07:56.489 --> 07:57.406
- Oh, okay.

07:58.449 --> 08:01.288
- Yeah, I know it's a
lot, but the Shift Manager

08:01.288 --> 08:03.087
did it for a little while.

08:03.087 --> 08:04.576
Okay.

08:04.576 --> 08:06.826
- Or, the ex-Shift Manager.

08:07.774 --> 08:09.762
I gotta report this.

08:09.762 --> 08:10.601
Go, go, get outta here.

08:10.601 --> 08:11.434
Let me go ahead.

08:11.434 --> 08:12.887
I gotta make a call.

08:16.071 --> 08:16.904
Go ahead out.

08:16.904 --> 08:19.451
I gotta call the police.

08:24.528 --> 08:26.578
Close the door!

08:36.488 --> 08:39.488
Yeah, I'd like to report some theft.

08:40.526 --> 08:43.193
Yeah, one of my employees stole.

08:49.189 --> 08:50.966
Well, actually it's two of my employees.

08:50.966 --> 08:53.339
One I caught stealin' off the register.

08:53.339 --> 08:55.214
The other one I caught
changin' her pay rate

08:55.214 --> 08:56.547
on the computer.

08:57.528 --> 09:00.111
What is that, like, wire fraud?

09:03.305 --> 09:05.934
- I heard everything he said, man.

09:05.934 --> 09:07.648
You got like four jobs, huh?

09:07.648 --> 09:08.481
- Yeah.

09:09.646 --> 09:11.627
- Workin' way too hard, man.

09:11.627 --> 09:12.460
See?

09:12.460 --> 09:13.509
Can't let them see that.

09:13.509 --> 09:15.342
They're gonna use you.

09:39.663 --> 09:40.496
- Ah, yes.

09:41.541 --> 09:42.374
Yes.

09:47.060 --> 09:48.626
Mm.

09:48.626 --> 09:49.459
Mm.

09:54.467 --> 09:55.753
Hey, ma.

09:55.753 --> 09:56.836
- Hey, Randy.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.698
How's work goin'?

09:59.698 --> 10:00.531
- Good, good.

10:00.531 --> 10:01.801
I got a promotion after my first week.

10:01.801 --> 10:04.400
- Oh, that's good,
that's good, that's good.

10:05.233 --> 10:06.400
You know what?

10:07.337 --> 10:10.170
I'm glad you did,
because I need some help.

10:10.170 --> 10:12.831
I just got my last unemployment check and

10:12.831 --> 10:15.341
I'm actually on here
lookin' for a job now.

10:16.742 --> 10:19.519
Boy, would you go get some water?

10:19.519 --> 10:20.436
- I'm okay.

10:21.977 --> 10:22.810
- Anyway.

10:23.916 --> 10:26.999
Go to the store for me and get, like,

10:29.717 --> 10:31.367
two bottles of that Earl Stevens

10:31.367 --> 10:34.284
and play my big lottery game, okay?

10:40.208 --> 10:42.125
I got it, ma.

10:46.478 --> 10:50.954
Ma, you know no matter what,
it's going to be okay, right?

10:50.954 --> 10:52.954
- I know, Randy, I know.

10:53.989 --> 10:54.822
Love you.

12:11.170 --> 12:13.283
How long have
you had the hiccups?

12:13.283 --> 12:16.349
- Uh, for about three days.

12:17.662 --> 12:18.859
- Let me listen to you.

12:25.184 --> 12:27.351
Take a deep breath for me.

12:30.371 --> 12:31.797
Okay.

12:31.797 --> 12:32.630
Again.

12:36.633 --> 12:37.466
Okay.

12:38.806 --> 12:40.704
Does it hurt when you breathe?

12:40.704 --> 12:41.554
- Not at all.

12:41.554 --> 12:42.513
No?

12:42.513 --> 12:43.874
Okay.

12:47.292 --> 12:50.160
Well, other than the
hiccups, I don't see or hear

12:50.160 --> 12:52.303
anything alarming.

12:52.303 --> 12:56.799
So, there's no medicine
for hiccups, unfortunately.

12:58.225 --> 13:00.844
Continue doing your home remedies.

13:00.844 --> 13:04.373
Holding your breath and
drinking plenty of water.

13:04.373 --> 13:07.099
And breathing in and out of a bag.

13:07.099 --> 13:10.014
And you're not experiencing any pain?

13:10.014 --> 13:11.181
- None at all.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.784
- It should go away soon.

13:16.784 --> 13:19.713
And if it doesn't, just
come back and see me, okay?

13:19.713 --> 13:20.546
- Okay.

13:20.546 --> 13:21.379
All right.

13:21.379 --> 13:22.386
Any questions for me?

13:22.386 --> 13:23.658
- Uh, yeah, can I have a doctor's excuse?

13:23.658 --> 13:25.092
I'm a little late for work.

13:25.092 --> 13:26.179
- Oh, sure.

13:33.157 --> 13:34.257
Hey, yo, what's up, Randy?

13:34.257 --> 13:35.502
- Hey, what's up, bro?

13:35.502 --> 13:37.811
Everything good.

13:37.811 --> 13:38.644
Check this out.

13:38.644 --> 13:40.443
I know you seen that game last night.

13:40.443 --> 13:41.875
- Ah, I missed it.

13:41.875 --> 13:43.177
- You missed the game?

13:43.177 --> 13:45.225
The buzzer beater?

13:45.225 --> 13:46.058
Woo.

13:46.058 --> 13:47.626
It was nasty, bro.

13:47.626 --> 13:49.212
Hey, yo, check this out then.

13:49.212 --> 13:51.922
Tonight, when the highlights
come on, you gotta see it.

13:51.922 --> 13:52.880
- Oh yeah, for sure.

13:52.880 --> 13:53.838
- For sure, bro.

13:53.838 --> 13:54.671
I'm tellin' you.

13:54.671 --> 13:55.504
Don't miss it.
- All right.

13:55.504 --> 13:57.442
- I'm outta here.

13:57.442 --> 13:58.922
Hey, yo, fellas, what up?

13:58.922 --> 13:59.905
- What up?
- Yo, bro.

13:59.905 --> 14:01.127
- Slow motion, man.

14:01.127 --> 14:01.960
Hey, tell me this.

14:01.960 --> 14:03.661
I know you all saw that
game last night, right?

14:03.661 --> 14:04.494
- You know I saw it.

14:04.494 --> 14:05.327
I'm tellin' ya.

14:05.327 --> 14:06.634
I told y'all.
- What he do?

14:06.634 --> 14:08.130
- I told y'all that young fella was gonna

14:08.130 --> 14:08.963
take over the league.

14:08.963 --> 14:09.948
He was crossin' it.

14:12.138 --> 14:12.971
- Nasty.

14:12.971 --> 14:13.804
- Lose some.

14:13.804 --> 14:14.637
- Right?

14:14.637 --> 14:16.060
- Hey, hey, your mans.

14:16.060 --> 14:17.424
He still got the hiccups, dawg?

14:17.424 --> 14:20.700
Bro, he had the
hiccups, like, all week long.

14:20.700 --> 14:23.440
- Every time I see him,
he.

14:25.873 --> 14:28.704
- Not even tryin' to be funny,
that shit look like it hurts.

14:28.704 --> 14:29.669
It do.

14:29.669 --> 14:30.850
Serious.

14:30.850 --> 14:32.063
I'm gonna
make a dance out of it

14:32.063 --> 14:32.896
on two dollar Tuesday.

14:37.298 --> 14:38.133
- You fly off on that.

14:38.133 --> 14:38.966
Right.

14:38.966 --> 14:39.799
Crazy.

14:39.799 --> 14:42.239
- Hey, I got somethin'
to fix that, though.

14:42.239 --> 14:43.682
- Whatchu gonna do to fix it?

14:44.985 --> 14:47.235
I'll show you.

15:03.258 --> 15:04.091
- You all right?
- You all right?

15:04.091 --> 15:05.549
- You all right, bro?

15:05.549 --> 15:06.466
- You good?

15:10.851 --> 15:12.078
- Hey, D.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.818
Didn't work, bro.

15:13.818 --> 15:15.352
- Man, what the hell was you all doin'?

15:15.352 --> 15:17.119
- Hey, chill.

15:17.119 --> 15:18.784
Was just tryin' to scare
the hiccups out you.

15:18.784 --> 15:20.938
- Man, you all play too damn much.

16:27.571 --> 16:29.515
- Are you sure you don't drink?

16:29.515 --> 16:33.840
A case of hiccups lasting
over 30 days is rare.

16:33.840 --> 16:34.673
Yes.

16:34.673 --> 16:35.840
Yes, I'm sure.

16:39.466 --> 16:41.621
- Your X-rays look good.

16:41.621 --> 16:44.682
The cause is really unknown.

16:44.682 --> 16:47.682
It's just a chronic case of hiccups.

16:49.094 --> 16:51.786
- How long is that gonna take?

16:51.786 --> 16:55.172
- Chronic case of hiccups
last over two days

16:55.172 --> 16:58.005
and can continue for over a month.

17:00.792 --> 17:01.625
Listen.

17:03.313 --> 17:06.235
I don't really have an answer for that.

17:06.235 --> 17:10.368
I've read about cases where
hiccups stopped immediately

17:10.368 --> 17:12.929
after a tumor was removed.

17:13.762 --> 17:15.436
Not that that's your situation,

17:15.436 --> 17:20.436
but I did read about hiccups
that lasted over 60 years.

17:20.719 --> 17:22.768
And another case where it was eight years.

17:22.768 --> 17:23.673
- Wait.

17:23.673 --> 17:24.506
60 years.

17:24.506 --> 17:25.339
No.

17:26.339 --> 17:27.921
- You know, typically these things

17:27.921 --> 17:30.799
go away within minutes, okay?

17:30.799 --> 17:32.590
I do wanna run some more tests.

17:32.590 --> 17:36.272
I would like to run a stress test on you.

17:36.272 --> 17:39.072
And a allergy panel, as well.

17:39.072 --> 17:42.174
This could be related to hypersensitivity.

17:42.174 --> 17:44.164
- Okay, I'll try anything.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.881
'Cause now it's startin'
to hurt up here now.

17:46.881 --> 17:48.290
- Hm. Okay.

17:48.290 --> 17:50.095
Well, that's your diaphragm.

17:50.095 --> 17:53.111
I'll have the nurse bring
in a prescription for you.

17:53.111 --> 17:54.097
For pain.

17:54.097 --> 17:55.004
Okay?
-  Okay.

17:55.004 --> 17:55.837
- All right.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.287
Corporate, can I help you?

18:25.287 --> 18:27.305
- Hi, I was callin' to
find out how I could become

18:27.305 --> 18:29.025
a Lyft driver?

18:29.025 --> 18:31.719
You have to
have a valid driver's license

18:31.719 --> 18:33.922
and fill out our online app.

18:33.922 --> 18:38.044
Then bring in your car to
a hub so we can expect it.

18:38.044 --> 18:40.726
Then, once everything is
approved, you're good to go.

18:40.726 --> 18:41.920
- Okay, so that's it?

18:41.920 --> 18:43.344
Yes, sir.

18:43.344 --> 18:44.177
- Thanks.

18:52.458 --> 18:54.625
Home remedies for hiccups.

19:03.852 --> 19:05.435
Traditional healer.

19:06.483 --> 19:07.316
Whoa.

19:17.873 --> 19:18.706
Hm.

19:20.411 --> 19:22.578
She might be able to help.

19:27.318 --> 19:28.419
Randy Glass?

19:28.419 --> 19:29.252
- Yes.

19:29.252 --> 19:30.594
- Here's your prescription.

19:30.594 --> 19:31.567
It's gonna be 20 dollars.

19:31.567 --> 19:32.898
Is it gonna be cash or card?

19:32.898 --> 19:34.139
- Uh.

19:34.139 --> 19:34.972
Cash.

19:37.190 --> 19:38.594
- Thank you.

19:38.594 --> 19:39.427
- Thank you.

19:39.427 --> 19:41.510
You're welcome.

20:00.561 --> 20:02.017
Randy Glass?

20:02.017 --> 20:03.100
- Yep.

20:03.100 --> 20:03.944
Here you go.

20:03.944 --> 20:04.777
- Thank you.

20:04.777 --> 20:05.610
You're welcome.

20:05.610 --> 20:08.210
- Congrats on the Shift Manager.

20:08.210 --> 20:09.377
- Thanks, man.

20:20.930 --> 20:21.763
Hey, bro.

20:21.763 --> 20:22.596
Hurry up.

20:22.596 --> 20:23.429
Come on.

20:23.429 --> 20:24.345
Hey, hey, I gotta get my bag.

20:24.345 --> 20:25.180
My keys in there.

20:25.180 --> 20:26.013
Man, forget that bag.

20:26.013 --> 20:26.866
Forget them keys.

20:26.866 --> 20:27.699
I'm out.

20:27.699 --> 20:28.532
Man, where y'all goin'?

20:28.532 --> 20:29.365
We don't get off 'til six.

20:29.365 --> 20:31.047
- Man, we about to go cash
these checks, brother.

20:31.047 --> 20:32.090
He overpaid us.

20:32.090 --> 20:32.952
Well, how much?

20:32.952 --> 20:33.929
I ain't gonna tell you.

20:33.929 --> 20:35.229
You'd go and snitch.

20:44.942 --> 20:46.192
What?

20:49.639 --> 20:50.825
What?

20:51.823 --> 20:53.850
Clear
souffle' plastic lids.

20:53.850 --> 20:57.207
Item six, 16 slotted plastic lids.

20:57.207 --> 20:59.374
Item seven, 16 oz up foam.

21:00.673 --> 21:02.273
Item eight, paprika.

21:05.239 --> 21:06.320
- Come back in 15 minutes, Randy.

21:06.320 --> 21:07.706
I'm orderin' supplies right now.

21:07.706 --> 21:11.197
Item
11, egg fresh shells.

21:11.197 --> 21:13.927
Item 12, apple cider vinegar.

21:13.927 --> 21:16.793

Item 4, diced tomatoes.

21:20.124 --> 21:21.795
Item 15, cream vanilla-

21:27.350 --> 21:28.491
Half?

21:28.491 --> 21:30.993
I'm not givin' y'all
half of my check, bro.

21:30.993 --> 21:33.088
No way, bro, you're crazy.

21:33.088 --> 21:34.158
- Okay.

21:34.158 --> 21:36.217
What about 3500?

21:36.217 --> 21:38.526
- You cashed all my other
checks for 10 dollars.

21:38.526 --> 21:39.991
Why would I give you 3500 dollars?

21:41.038 --> 21:42.959
- I can't cash this.

21:42.959 --> 21:44.757
It's too high of a risk.

21:50.773 --> 21:55.067
- All right, man, I'll
give you 500 dollars.

21:55.067 --> 21:56.317
- 1500 dollars.

21:58.457 --> 21:59.530
- Okay.

21:59.530 --> 22:00.363
Deal.

22:06.163 --> 22:08.472
You're not gonna cash
it or somethin', man?

22:08.472 --> 22:09.350
- You gotta sign it.

22:14.430 --> 22:18.013
And I need
about 3000 in singles.

22:19.420 --> 22:22.509
- What's your routing number?

22:22.509 --> 22:23.342
- Routing number?

22:23.342 --> 22:24.906
I don't got that with me.

22:24.906 --> 22:28.239
- I need to set up direct deposit.

22:28.239 --> 22:29.293
- Naw, naw, man.

22:29.293 --> 22:30.410
I don't want direct deposit.

22:30.410 --> 22:32.427
I told you I need cash.

22:32.427 --> 22:33.260
Cash.

22:37.651 --> 22:40.234
- It's gonna cost you 500 more.

22:42.353 --> 22:45.137
Done negotiating after that.

22:45.137 --> 22:45.970
- All right.

22:45.970 --> 22:47.220
All right, man.

22:58.274 --> 23:00.055
- Unbelievable.

23:00.055 --> 23:01.532
Seven rags.

23:02.490 --> 23:03.411
Seven, baby.

23:03.411 --> 23:05.510
That's what I'm talkin' about, baby.

23:05.510 --> 23:06.769
Seven.

23:06.769 --> 23:07.690
Seven.

23:08.523 --> 23:09.356
Let's get it, baby.

23:09.356 --> 23:11.655
Let's get it, let's get it,
let's get it, let's get it.

23:11.655 --> 23:13.067
Get it.

23:14.150 --> 23:14.983
Let's go!

23:17.144 --> 23:17.977
7,000.

23:19.779 --> 23:20.612
7 rags.

23:20.612 --> 23:21.445
I knew there was

23:21.445 --> 23:24.160
somethin' special about you.

23:24.160 --> 23:25.118
You wanna take it for a ride?

23:25.118 --> 23:26.467
You need some water?

23:26.467 --> 23:29.127
Naw, I'm okay.

23:29.127 --> 23:31.562
My neighbor's
wife had a car just like this.

23:31.562 --> 23:33.282
They had it forever.

23:33.282 --> 23:36.043
They took it on road trips and everything.

23:36.043 --> 23:36.876
You see those miles?

23:37.709 --> 23:39.511
Those are original low miles on this car.

23:39.511 --> 23:40.675
We had it inspected.

23:40.675 --> 23:42.795
This car is perfect for you.

23:42.795 --> 23:43.645
- Yeah, I like it.

23:43.645 --> 23:45.320
How much y'all want for it?

23:45.320 --> 23:46.489
8,000 dollars.

23:47.333 --> 23:48.297
- Ah, that's too much.

23:48.297 --> 23:49.880
I can't swing that.

23:50.852 --> 23:52.310
Since you
came back to the dealership

23:52.310 --> 23:53.455
so early,

23:53.455 --> 23:56.486
I'm gonna let you have it for 7500.

23:56.486 --> 23:58.119
- What about 6,000?

23:58.119 --> 23:59.682
- You pay 7,000 in cash.

23:59.682 --> 24:01.849
And I will sell it to you.

24:03.449 --> 24:04.393
- All right.

24:04.393 --> 24:06.302
Okay, I'll take it.

24:06.302 --> 24:07.711
- You sure?

24:07.711 --> 24:09.307
You wanna take that 7,000 dollars,

24:09.307 --> 24:10.189
apply it towards that truck,

24:10.189 --> 24:12.131
and we can finance the difference?

24:12.131 --> 24:13.641
- Mm, no, I'm cool.

24:13.641 --> 24:15.054
I like this one.

24:15.054 --> 24:17.181
- Okay, get what you like.

24:17.181 --> 24:19.588
Okay, I'm gonna print the
rest of the paperwork.

24:20.546 --> 24:24.372
And, you're gonna need car insurance.

24:28.772 --> 24:29.605
- Hold on.

24:29.605 --> 24:30.843
I'm gonna go check for you.

24:30.843 --> 24:32.276
Okay.

25:18.455 --> 25:19.288
Hello?

25:19.288 --> 25:21.444
- Hi, is this Dr. Adriana?

25:21.444 --> 25:23.111
Yes?

25:24.105 --> 25:26.188
- Do you cure the hiccups?

25:26.188 --> 25:27.381
Hiccups?

25:27.381 --> 25:28.214
Yes.

25:29.454 --> 25:30.912
- Okay.

25:30.912 --> 25:33.255
Do I need to make an appointment?

25:33.255 --> 25:35.627
No, just come.

25:35.627 --> 25:38.929
- Okay, your insurance is
gonna be 800 dollars down

25:38.929 --> 25:40.685
and you can drive off the lot.

25:40.685 --> 25:42.216
Now, you can't afford that.

25:42.216 --> 25:44.651
Do you have somebody you
can borrow that money from?

27:06.128 --> 27:07.692

27:07.692 --> 27:09.219

27:09.219 --> 27:10.722
I don't act so right

27:10.722 --> 27:13.267

27:38.078 --> 27:41.169

28:18.836 --> 28:19.669

28:20.502 --> 28:22.137

28:24.966 --> 28:27.084
Okay, I'm

28:27.084 --> 28:28.524

28:31.416 --> 28:32.249

28:32.249 --> 28:33.707
- Just cancel everybody and leave.

28:33.707 --> 28:35.737
Nah, just one more shoot.

What you about to do?

28:36.795 --> 28:39.430

28:59.716 --> 29:01.900

29:01.900 --> 29:02.733
Nevermind.

29:25.025 --> 29:25.920
Hey.

Excuse me.

29:27.155 --> 29:28.569

29:30.600 --> 29:31.630
- I'm tryin' to get to Las Vegas.

29:31.630 --> 29:32.959

That's my favorite kinda car right here.

29:50.625 --> 29:51.458
Mustang.

29:52.345 --> 29:55.041
And my favorite color is yellow.

29:55.041 --> 29:56.124

30:00.293 --> 30:01.532
Yes, my name is August, like the month.

30:01.532 --> 30:02.365
Hello?

30:03.435 --> 30:05.557
Look, I don't really like
dealin' with no one-line

30:05.557 --> 30:06.483
appointment schedulin' people.

30:06.483 --> 30:08.400
Can I just talk to Zap?

30:10.493 --> 30:11.493
He knows me.

30:13.684 --> 30:15.715
All right, just tell him I'm on my way.

30:15.715 --> 30:17.941
I'm just runnin' late.

30:19.979 --> 30:20.981
All right.

30:20.981 --> 30:23.231
So, I-15 North is that way.

30:25.430 --> 30:26.263
Wait.

30:26.263 --> 30:27.513
Where you from?

30:28.487 --> 30:29.749
- From Detroit.

30:29.749 --> 30:31.203
- Hm.

30:31.203 --> 30:33.316
You here on vacation?

30:33.316 --> 30:34.149
- I'm, uh-

30:34.149 --> 30:35.716
- Your princess with you?

30:35.716 --> 30:37.188
- I'm here to see a lady, so.

30:37.188 --> 30:38.021
- Hm.

30:38.021 --> 30:39.188
As you should.

30:40.163 --> 30:43.731
And you should take her
about 300 red roses, too.

30:43.731 --> 30:45.384
- All right.

30:45.384 --> 30:46.847
- But I'm on my way to this photo shoot,

30:46.847 --> 30:50.029
so do you mind if I take a
pic in front of your car?

30:50.029 --> 30:51.513
No, go ahead.

30:57.872 --> 30:58.705
- This angle.

30:58.705 --> 30:59.538
Here.

30:59.538 --> 31:00.705
Take this pic.

31:04.588 --> 31:06.775
How do I find North Las Vegas?

31:06.775 --> 31:07.733
- Okay.

31:07.733 --> 31:09.952
You gon' go right that way.

31:09.952 --> 31:12.371
And then you're gonna make
a right at the next light.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.497
And then you're gonna go left.

31:14.497 --> 31:16.377
And then you gonna veer-

31:17.621 --> 31:18.606
You know what?

31:18.606 --> 31:20.288
It's too much.

31:20.288 --> 31:21.635
Why don't you just let me ride with you

31:21.635 --> 31:24.364
and then you can drop me off
at the studio afterwards?

31:26.967 --> 31:28.662
- All right, come on.

31:29.671 --> 31:30.504
- There.

31:30.504 --> 31:33.180
So what's you sippin' on?

31:33.180 --> 31:35.397
Uh, right now, nothin'.

31:35.397 --> 31:37.216
You ain't buzzed at all?

31:37.216 --> 31:38.226
I'm tryin' to
take care of these hiccups.

31:38.226 --> 31:40.407
I got a chronic case, all right?

31:41.377 --> 31:42.997
All you gotta
do is drink a whole

31:42.997 --> 31:44.080
bunch of water.

31:44.080 --> 31:45.520
And then you gotta hold your breath-

31:45.520 --> 31:46.542
I already tried all that.

31:46.542 --> 31:47.375
It didn't work.

31:47.375 --> 31:49.544
That's kinda why I'm here.

31:50.687 --> 31:53.722
I know this
might sound backwards, but

31:53.722 --> 31:56.222
champagne always works for me.

31:58.879 --> 32:00.040
- I thought about that.

32:03.733 --> 32:06.214
- So where this lady's office at?

32:06.214 --> 32:07.721
What's the address?

32:10.184 --> 32:11.788
There ain't no address.

32:11.788 --> 32:14.459
Just says North Las Vegas.

32:14.459 --> 32:17.388
Does it say North
Las Vegas Boulevard or what?

32:17.388 --> 32:18.221
- No.

32:19.967 --> 32:20.951
Just google it.

32:20.951 --> 32:21.868
Let me see.

32:35.090 --> 32:36.858
This is not real.

32:36.858 --> 32:38.480
Yes it is.

32:38.480 --> 32:39.313
Look, scroll down.

32:39.313 --> 32:40.976
Read the testimonials.

32:40.976 --> 32:41.985
- Ain't no way this is real.

32:41.985 --> 32:43.958
- Dude with sleep disorder.

32:43.958 --> 32:44.817
Cured him in one visit.

32:44.817 --> 32:45.650
- Mm. Mm.

32:45.650 --> 32:46.483
- Scroll down some more.

32:46.483 --> 32:47.316
- Yeah?

32:47.316 --> 32:48.588
- Severe anxiety.

32:48.588 --> 32:49.654
Cured him, too.

32:50.764 --> 32:51.597
You're so damn negative.

32:51.597 --> 32:52.627
- No.

32:52.627 --> 32:53.795
Oh my God.

32:53.795 --> 32:54.628
Okay.

32:54.628 --> 32:56.461
Mm.

32:56.461 --> 32:57.793
- I believe her.

32:57.793 --> 33:01.638
And I ain't come all the
way out here to not try.

33:01.638 --> 33:03.894
- This angle, though.

33:03.894 --> 33:04.727
Oo.

33:05.560 --> 33:06.393
Oo, yes.

33:06.393 --> 33:07.226
Yes.

33:07.226 --> 33:08.493
- This ain't even your phone.

33:08.493 --> 33:09.689
- Ah.

33:09.689 --> 33:11.272
- Selfies and shit.

33:12.588 --> 33:13.588
- All right.

33:14.668 --> 33:19.621
So why don't you just try,
like, some scare tactics?

33:19.621 --> 33:20.557
- Right.

33:20.557 --> 33:21.724
Scare tactics.

33:29.183 --> 33:30.809
CBD.

33:31.642 --> 33:32.706
They better not try to overcharge me.

33:32.706 --> 33:33.925
'Cause I know how they do.

33:33.925 --> 33:35.666
- Uncle Elbow.

33:35.666 --> 33:36.666
Uncle Elbow?

33:38.810 --> 33:39.828
- Nephew?

33:39.828 --> 33:40.661
Is that you?

33:40.661 --> 33:41.494
Yes.

33:41.494 --> 33:42.577
- Oh, damn.

33:42.577 --> 33:43.927
Look at you, man.

33:43.927 --> 33:46.486
What you doin' out here in LV?

33:46.486 --> 33:48.596
Look like I'm lookin' at a ghost, boy.

33:49.606 --> 33:51.128
Oh no.

33:52.116 --> 33:53.810
You out here for that 30 dollars I owe you

33:53.810 --> 33:55.732

33:55.732 --> 33:57.204
- You mean 50 dollars.

33:57.204 --> 33:58.061
- I told you.

33:58.061 --> 34:01.015
As soon as I sell that iPhone,
I'm gonna Cash app you.

34:01.015 --> 34:02.197
Right.

34:02.197 --> 34:03.566
And that's why you wasn't
pickin' up your phone for?

34:05.222 --> 34:06.271
I'm not even here for that.

34:06.271 --> 34:09.196
I'm actually here to see
a doctor for my hiccups.

34:09.196 --> 34:10.972
I'm on my
way to this dispensary.

34:10.972 --> 34:13.969
Now, I know you don't smoke,
but come walk with me, man.

34:13.969 --> 34:14.802
Come on.

34:14.802 --> 34:15.635
You're comin' with me.

34:15.635 --> 34:16.468

34:16.468 --> 34:18.474
I got a couple runs to make, though, huh?

34:18.474 --> 34:19.572
What?

34:22.062 --> 34:25.238
One hell of a night, nephew?

34:25.238 --> 34:26.765
Ooh.

34:26.765 --> 34:27.982
Dawg.

Is that your whip?

34:29.446 --> 34:30.371
Ooh.

34:30.371 --> 34:31.329
Let's hit the strip.

34:31.329 --> 34:32.162

34:32.995 --> 34:33.921
I gotta drop her off first.

34:33.921 --> 34:34.992
Where your whip at?

34:34.992 --> 34:37.624

34:37.624 --> 34:38.995

34:38.995 --> 34:40.851

You know how that goes.

Well, lucky for her, it's

34:57.875 --> 34:59.984
Therefore, you can leave
her ass here and I'm ridin'

34:59.984 --> 35:01.454

35:02.476 --> 35:04.480
I gotta at least drop
her off for helpin' me.

35:04.480 --> 35:06.595
I mean, you can get in the backseat.

- All right, look, man.

38:20.306 --> 38:22.050
Where you at?

38:22.050 --> 38:23.861
- Come up, make a left.

38:23.861 --> 38:26.944
I'm on the first street on the right.

38:52.738 --> 38:54.851
- Hey, what's happening?

38:54.851 --> 38:56.071
- I told her we was ballers, man,

38:56.071 --> 38:58.161
and we got the car that they can use.

38:58.161 --> 38:59.080
- What?

38:59.080 --> 39:00.692
- Look, man, they shootin'
a music video in there.

39:00.692 --> 39:03.035
And I said, "Look, we got
a sports car you can use."

39:03.035 --> 39:03.936
She was like, "Word?"

39:03.936 --> 39:05.282
I was like, "Word."

39:05.282 --> 39:07.199
They gon' let us watch.

39:08.555 --> 39:11.814
May be able to hook up
with them afterwords, too.

39:11.814 --> 39:13.481
Seen her?

39:20.928 --> 39:21.761
All right.

39:22.892 --> 39:23.725
All right.

39:28.144 --> 39:29.957
- I'm not tryin' to see no music video.

39:29.957 --> 39:30.790
Where's your cab?

39:30.790 --> 39:31.856
I gotta go see this lady.

39:31.856 --> 39:33.096
- Come on, man.

39:33.096 --> 39:35.328
Look, I just wanna see how they shoot it.

39:35.328 --> 39:38.272
Man, look it, there's bitches in there.

39:38.272 --> 39:39.689
Fine bitches too.

39:40.768 --> 39:42.758
- I'm ready to go.

39:42.758 --> 39:43.591
- Come on, Randy.

39:43.591 --> 39:45.022
I gotta see this one girl do her thing.

39:45.022 --> 39:47.000
She said it's her turn
to pop off in the camera.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.764
And I know that motherfuckin'
girl gonna be like boom!

40:00.411 --> 40:01.702
-  Cut, cut.

40:01.702 --> 40:02.535
- Why, wassup, baby?

40:02.535 --> 40:03.368
How do I look?

40:03.368 --> 40:04.201
- No, you look good, man.

40:04.201 --> 40:05.034
We just too empty in here.

40:05.034 --> 40:06.265
We gotta bring some people in here, man.

40:06.265 --> 40:07.883
Come over here, man.

40:07.883 --> 40:10.438
Put these glasses on, man.

40:10.438 --> 40:11.431
Fold your arms like a
security guard in the corner

40:11.431 --> 40:12.265
or somethin'.

40:12.265 --> 40:13.098
Hey, cutie, how you doin'?

40:13.098 --> 40:13.931
Come over here.
-  Me?

40:13.931 --> 40:14.764
Oh my goodness.

40:14.764 --> 40:15.597
- Take some selfies next to him.

40:15.597 --> 40:18.097
Come here and stand over here.

40:24.173 --> 40:25.006
Don't rap to it, just dance.

40:25.006 --> 40:26.339
Just dance right now.

40:26.339 --> 40:28.139
Just dance to it.

40:28.139 --> 40:28.972
Action, action.

40:30.187 --> 40:33.433
I'm finally
famous, baby, yes I am.

41:24.074 --> 41:24.907
Hey, hey.

41:24.907 --> 41:26.072
Cut the music.

41:26.072 --> 41:27.310
Damn good, rapper.

41:27.310 --> 41:30.220
One more scene and we're gonna
shoot that hot tub scene.

41:31.259 --> 41:32.208
- My neighbor told me there's a party

41:32.208 --> 41:34.095
goin' on over here.

41:34.095 --> 41:36.143
That's not what I rent my house out for.

41:36.143 --> 41:36.976
You gotta go.

41:36.976 --> 41:39.245
- Yo, I got this spot
for another two days.

41:39.245 --> 41:41.322
And we gotta drop this video.

41:41.322 --> 41:43.047
- You can drop your video,
but it ain't gonna be

41:43.047 --> 41:44.346
in my house.

41:44.346 --> 41:45.634
Breach of contract.

41:45.634 --> 41:47.044
No parties, no filmin-

41:47.044 --> 41:48.322
- Man, that's bullshit.

41:48.322 --> 41:49.695
I'm not gonna let no bum
with a piece of paper

41:49.695 --> 41:50.670
tell me what I gotta do.

41:50.670 --> 41:51.503
Hey, hey, yo.

41:51.503 --> 41:52.810
Slow down, big fella.

41:52.810 --> 41:55.789
- You can cut all the tough talk, my man.

41:55.789 --> 41:56.622
Wait, wait.

41:56.622 --> 41:58.859
I need everybody to
stop what you're doin'.

41:58.859 --> 42:01.172
Look, we can
handle these one of two ways.

42:01.172 --> 42:03.734
You can get arrested
or you can just leave.

42:03.734 --> 42:06.999
But, y'all're gonna have
to settle this in court.

42:06.999 --> 42:07.946
- Right now, everybody gonna
have to get outta here.

42:07.946 --> 42:09.196
Y'all gotta go.

42:10.205 --> 42:12.070
And I'm gon' need some IDs.

42:12.070 --> 42:13.021
Make sure there ain't no minors in here

42:13.021 --> 42:14.421
with all this alcohol on the set.

42:17.171 --> 42:18.446
Hey, hey, man.

42:18.446 --> 42:19.431
I'm lettin' you know right now.

42:19.431 --> 42:21.381
I'm on probation, man, and
none of this stuff is real.

42:21.381 --> 42:23.194
We just shootin' a video, man.

42:23.194 --> 42:24.081
Probation for what?

42:25.054 --> 42:26.683
Aw, y'all are drunk.

42:26.683 --> 42:27.956
I need everybody to get their IDs.

42:27.956 --> 42:29.373
I need to see ID.

42:35.841 --> 42:36.841
- Got my ID.

42:38.756 --> 42:40.968
You're goin' to
jail if you ain't got it.

42:40.968 --> 42:41.801
All right?

42:41.801 --> 42:44.301
Sometime this week, big fella.

42:55.669 --> 42:57.220
Man, whatever.

43:00.394 --> 43:02.644
- Need to check on Bateman.

43:04.531 --> 43:05.983
Elroy Glass.

43:05.983 --> 43:08.556
- Oh shit, I gotta go to the bathroom.

43:08.556 --> 43:10.889
I'm followin' you.

43:12.146 --> 43:16.244
- Daniel, Octavia and Elroy has warrants.

43:16.244 --> 43:18.411
- Where is Octavia Bateman

43:20.446 --> 43:22.156
and Elroy Glass?

43:22.156 --> 43:23.131
Where'd them two go?

43:24.858 --> 43:26.706
Octavia Bateman is armed

43:26.706 --> 43:27.539
and dangerous.

43:28.372 --> 43:29.205
Repeat, armed and dangerous.

43:29.205 --> 43:31.129
- Hey, everybody here, get your hands up.

43:31.129 --> 43:32.244
Everybody.

43:32.244 --> 43:34.493
I need everybody out here
get your hands up right now.

43:34.493 --> 43:35.430
- Why do I gotta get my hands up?

43:35.430 --> 43:36.263
I own this house.

43:36.263 --> 43:37.096
- Look, I know, sir.

43:37.096 --> 43:38.231
I just need you to leave
right now 'til I can

43:38.231 --> 43:40.169
get this situation under control.

43:40.169 --> 43:41.669
Everybody get out.

43:42.581 --> 43:43.414
Everybody.

43:44.289 --> 43:45.539
Get outta here.

43:48.019 --> 43:49.194
Keep your hands up.

43:49.194 --> 43:52.194
Keep your hands where I can see 'em.

44:34.211 --> 44:35.044
Hands up.

44:35.044 --> 44:35.877
You.

44:35.877 --> 44:36.710
You up against the wall.

44:36.710 --> 44:37.543
Come on.

44:39.097 --> 44:39.930
Please leave your message-

44:40.763 --> 44:42.001
- Not answerin' the phone.

44:49.120 --> 44:52.281
You move before
I get these cuffs on,

44:52.281 --> 44:53.495
it's over.

44:53.495 --> 44:57.162
Finally

44:58.256 --> 45:00.123
Yes sir.

45:04.833 --> 45:06.546
- This is unit 1-15.

45:06.546 --> 45:09.248
We have Nevada's most wanted in custody

45:09.248 --> 45:11.345
and we'll be bringin' her in shortly.

45:11.345 --> 45:12.511
Copy that.

45:14.000 --> 45:14.948
- Girl.

45:14.948 --> 45:16.783
What the hell you do?

45:16.783 --> 45:18.386
What'd you do?

45:18.386 --> 45:20.020
You a killer?

45:20.020 --> 45:22.275
Oh, you got the breaks, huh?

45:22.275 --> 45:23.300
Damn.

45:23.300 --> 45:25.448
I was fucking with gangster bitches.

45:26.281 --> 45:28.364
Boy, you're a bad mother.

45:30.923 --> 45:32.257
- I left my money.

45:32.257 --> 45:33.090
- Money?

45:33.090 --> 45:33.923
What money?

45:33.923 --> 45:34.858
- My money was left in the house.

45:34.858 --> 45:36.858
- Are you drunk?

45:36.858 --> 45:38.123
Get outta here.

45:38.123 --> 45:39.097
No, this guy.

45:39.097 --> 45:40.860
They already got him
out, they came back in.

45:40.860 --> 45:42.933
He's tryin' to come back in the house.

45:42.933 --> 45:45.297
Excuse me, Sheriff.

45:45.297 --> 45:46.348
I left my property, my money.

45:46.348 --> 45:47.181
It's in there.

45:47.181 --> 45:48.097
- You need to go talk to him.

45:48.097 --> 45:49.180
- But I just-

45:51.657 --> 45:52.743
Randy, look.

45:52.743 --> 45:54.357
Go to the police department, man.

45:54.357 --> 45:55.190
Hey!

45:55.190 --> 45:56.707
Come and get me, man.
- Back up from the property.

45:56.707 --> 45:57.746
- Come pick me up, man.

45:57.746 --> 45:58.760
Come get me, too!

45:58.760 --> 46:00.496
- Girl, ain't nobody comin' to get yo ass.

46:00.496 --> 46:02.329
You's the reason we up in here.

46:02.329 --> 46:03.162
Shit.

46:03.162 --> 46:05.486
Too damn scared to jump
out the damn windows.

46:05.486 --> 46:06.319
Nephew!

46:06.319 --> 46:07.748
Go downtown to the bail bondsman.

46:07.748 --> 46:09.763
You know, the one with the commercial.

46:18.272 --> 46:19.813
"Don't be caught in a county trip.

46:19.813 --> 46:21.475
And don't let the cops catch you slippin'.

46:21.475 --> 46:23.413
Eight ball bails bond, baby."

46:31.963 --> 46:33.525
Don't
be in the county trippin'

46:33.525 --> 46:35.585
and don't let the cops catch you slippin'.

46:35.585 --> 46:36.875
Call Eight Ball Bail Bonds.

46:36.875 --> 46:38.884
Las Vegas, Nevada, baby.

46:38.884 --> 46:39.717
Get it in.

46:45.085 --> 46:46.712
Elroy Glass?

46:46.712 --> 46:48.045
Like the window?

46:49.764 --> 46:50.597
Okay.

46:50.597 --> 46:55.559
What station is he in and
how much is his warrant?

46:55.559 --> 46:56.621
Yeah.

46:56.621 --> 46:58.018
Do you know if there's
any other law enforcement

46:58.018 --> 46:59.935
that's lookin' for him?

47:01.846 --> 47:02.896
Okay.

47:02.896 --> 47:04.579
Okay.

47:04.579 --> 47:06.196
I'll be there to get him out tonight.

47:06.196 --> 47:07.521
And the other four.

47:07.521 --> 47:09.021
I'll see you soon.

47:17.613 --> 47:20.570
It's gonna be about 1800
to get him out tonight.

47:20.570 --> 47:21.403
Okay.

47:21.403 --> 47:22.270
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

47:23.290 --> 47:27.395
Wouldn't it just be better to
wait until he goes to court?

47:27.395 --> 47:29.913
So, he can some money?

47:29.913 --> 47:33.119
- I mean, you can, but,
it's gonna be about a week.

47:33.119 --> 47:33.952
No, that's too long.

47:33.952 --> 47:36.069
I'm gonna get him out tonight.

47:36.069 --> 47:38.130
- Look, are you sure?

47:38.130 --> 47:38.963
- Yeah, I'm sure.

47:38.963 --> 47:41.130
My grand dad will kill me.

47:47.886 --> 47:49.214
That's 1800.

47:49.214 --> 47:50.214
- Thank you.

47:55.426 --> 47:56.259
Okay.

47:56.259 --> 47:57.884
Let me get you a receipt.

47:57.884 --> 48:01.543
Where would you like for me
to tell him you're stayin'?

48:01.543 --> 48:02.691
- Highland Inn.

48:02.691 --> 48:03.524
Room 114.

48:07.226 --> 48:11.136
How long you think it's gonna take him?

48:11.136 --> 48:13.309
- I got five people to bail out.

48:13.309 --> 48:15.309
Three's from outta town.

48:16.874 --> 48:21.001
And one from Mexico that
I gotta get out before

48:21.001 --> 48:22.080
he goes to court.

48:22.080 --> 48:22.913
And your guy.

48:23.871 --> 48:25.553
It's gonna be awhile.

48:25.553 --> 48:27.561
Okay.

48:27.561 --> 48:28.394
Okay.

48:29.269 --> 48:30.102
All right.

48:30.102 --> 48:32.178
Thank you so much.

48:32.178 --> 48:33.758
How are we s'posed to find her?

48:33.758 --> 48:35.726
I can't believe she don't have an address.

48:35.726 --> 48:37.059
- Just call her.

48:45.623 --> 48:47.026
Please
leave your message for-

48:47.026 --> 48:48.621
- She didn't answer.

48:48.621 --> 48:49.454
Voicemail.

48:49.454 --> 48:51.064
- All right, so how 'bout
you just try to hold

48:51.064 --> 48:53.823
your breath until she does?

48:53.823 --> 48:55.971
I mean, that might
actually help you get rid

48:55.971 --> 48:57.221
of the hiccups.

48:58.095 --> 48:59.530
Fake anyway.

48:59.530 --> 49:00.363
- No she's not.

49:00.363 --> 49:01.196
She's real.

49:01.196 --> 49:03.384
I told you that earlier, remember?

49:03.384 --> 49:04.217
Look.

49:04.217 --> 49:05.340
She helped them, so she can help me.

49:05.340 --> 49:06.881
Mmhm.
- Look.

49:06.881 --> 49:07.714
Would you look at the phone?

49:07.714 --> 49:08.547
Look at the damn phone-
- No.

49:08.547 --> 49:09.380
Stop.

49:11.122 --> 49:11.955
- Can you get me my phone?

49:11.955 --> 49:12.788
- No.

49:12.788 --> 49:13.621
You get it.

49:13.621 --> 49:15.788

- No, you get it!

49:18.926 --> 49:19.873
Look.

49:19.873 --> 49:21.711
It's been a rough ass month.

49:21.711 --> 49:23.544
You get it.

49:32.956 --> 49:33.789
Look.

49:33.789 --> 49:37.667
I been makin' some stupid ass decisions.

49:37.667 --> 49:39.196
When my uncle get outta

49:39.196 --> 49:41.344

49:41.344 --> 49:43.370
And I'ma just take the rest
of my money, buy a car,

49:43.370 --> 49:45.591

49:45.591 --> 49:46.758
- Randy, look.

49:48.708 --> 49:49.603
Look.

49:58.098 --> 50:00.596
Ain't no doctor's offices out here.

50:00.596 --> 50:01.429
Wait a minute.

50:01.429 --> 50:03.309
Let me just check, okay?

50:05.199 --> 50:07.699
Location says it's right here.

50:14.774 --> 50:16.293
Whenever I click on the marker,

50:16.293 --> 50:18.783
it gives me this location.

50:19.616 --> 50:20.449
- A tent?

50:21.684 --> 50:22.517
A tent?

50:22.517 --> 50:24.415
Randy, she lives in a tent?

50:24.415 --> 50:26.251
She might be in there.

50:26.251 --> 50:28.067
Oh my God, a doctor in a tent.

50:28.067 --> 50:30.503
- You didn't even let me look yet.

50:30.503 --> 50:32.464
- This is stupid.

50:32.464 --> 50:33.297
Stupid.

50:34.714 --> 50:38.047
- I got a chronic case of
the hiccups and I need help.

50:38.047 --> 50:39.898
And I'm just tryin' to
find out where she is.

50:39.898 --> 50:43.122
I didn't come all the way
out here to turn back now.

50:43.122 --> 50:45.947
Can we just at least go look?

50:45.947 --> 50:46.780
- Fine.

51:16.085 --> 51:17.835
- Excuse me, Adriana?

51:20.558 --> 51:21.391
Adriana?

51:36.471 --> 51:38.191
I can't believe
you came all the way

51:38.191 --> 51:40.608
from Detroit for a Curandero.

51:42.533 --> 51:43.366
- What?

51:44.380 --> 51:45.547
- A Curandero.

51:46.741 --> 51:50.638
You know, one of those
traditional native healers.

51:50.638 --> 51:52.979
She gotta be from Mexico.

51:52.979 --> 51:55.396
One of those Mexican healers.

51:56.909 --> 51:58.038
- I don't care where she from.

51:58.038 --> 51:59.967
As long as she can take
care of my hiccups,

51:59.967 --> 52:00.884
I'm all in.

52:09.197 --> 52:10.364
- All in, huh?

52:18.329 --> 52:19.162
You know,

52:20.924 --> 52:23.091
most people come to Vegas.

52:24.342 --> 52:25.425
For vacation.

52:28.602 --> 52:29.435
To gamble.

52:31.865 --> 52:33.198
Drive nice cars.

52:35.388 --> 52:36.221
Party.

52:37.381 --> 52:38.214
Do drugs.

52:40.659 --> 52:41.492
Do a

52:43.590 --> 52:44.590
pretty girl.

52:52.311 --> 52:56.644
I want you to know that I'm
your pretty girl, Randy.

53:16.533 --> 53:18.123
- Who is it?

53:18.123 --> 53:19.201
Yo!

53:19.201 --> 53:21.096
It's me, man, open the door!

53:21.096 --> 53:22.708
Come on, man!

53:22.708 --> 53:23.601
Hurry up.

53:30.265 --> 53:31.450
Woo.

53:31.450 --> 53:33.258
Thanks for bailin' me out, baby.

53:33.258 --> 53:35.684
It's party time now, Nephew.

53:35.684 --> 53:37.645
I thought you was droppin' her ass off.

53:37.645 --> 53:38.478
Know what?

53:38.478 --> 53:39.311
Forget it.

53:39.311 --> 53:40.573
We can just leave her here.

53:40.573 --> 53:42.523
So let's go get some weed, some drank.

53:42.523 --> 53:44.335
Let's hit the strip!

53:44.335 --> 53:47.361
Let's ride slow so everybody can see me.

53:47.361 --> 53:49.693
You can't lock Uncle Elbow down.

53:49.693 --> 53:50.535
I'm a beast out here.

53:52.136 --> 53:54.446
Yeah, boy The Flamingo and Koval.

53:54.446 --> 53:55.816
Take some pics.

53:55.816 --> 53:57.605
Rest in peace, Tupac.

53:57.605 --> 53:59.785
Pour out a little liquor.

54:03.704 --> 54:04.537
Damn.

54:05.787 --> 54:06.818
Ooh.

54:06.818 --> 54:07.760
I'm hungry as hell.

54:07.760 --> 54:10.515
What you got around here to eat?

54:10.515 --> 54:13.589
- I'm hungry too, but I ain't
got no extra money right now.

54:13.589 --> 54:16.070
I got the rest of the money for Adriana.

54:16.070 --> 54:17.390
How did you get here anyway?

54:17.390 --> 54:19.851
Aw, man, you know
Eight Ball give you an uber

54:19.851 --> 54:21.333
when they bail you out.

54:21.333 --> 54:22.166
But, check it.

54:22.166 --> 54:24.795
I was in the ride share
with about five felons.

54:24.795 --> 54:27.737
Squashed in the little
ass car, smellin' bad.

54:27.737 --> 54:28.570
- Wait.

54:28.570 --> 54:29.403
Wait, wait, wait.

54:29.403 --> 54:30.409
What'd you say?

54:30.409 --> 54:31.364
- I said it stank.

54:31.364 --> 54:32.197
- Uh uh.

54:32.197 --> 54:33.030
Not you.

54:33.030 --> 54:34.081
Randy.

54:34.081 --> 54:34.914
- I said I was hungry.

54:34.914 --> 54:35.747
Why?

54:35.747 --> 54:36.638
You too?

54:36.638 --> 54:40.171
- Naw, you said you only have
enough money for Adriana?

54:40.171 --> 54:41.129
- Right.

54:41.129 --> 54:42.763
- Man, you wouldn't believe.

54:42.763 --> 54:43.976
Cats was trippin'.

54:43.976 --> 54:46.344
They had them missin' flights back home.

54:46.344 --> 54:48.674
This one cat left all
his shit at the hotel,

54:48.674 --> 54:49.806
rushin' to catch a flight,

54:49.806 --> 54:51.483
because he wasn't even
supposed to be here.

54:51.483 --> 54:54.104
He was on probation back home.

54:54.104 --> 54:55.729
But, let me tell you,
you know that ol' girl

54:55.729 --> 54:57.294
I was arrested with?

54:57.294 --> 55:00.155
Man, blasted a bitch 'cause
she messed up her eyebrow.

55:00.155 --> 55:01.918
You know, straight cold.

55:01.918 --> 55:05.048
Right now, she is wanted for murder.

55:05.048 --> 55:06.641
- You owe me 7,000 dollars.

55:06.641 --> 55:07.474
What?

55:07.474 --> 55:08.307
- What?

55:08.307 --> 55:09.814
Whatchu talkin' 'bout now?

55:09.814 --> 55:10.912
- You heard me.

55:10.912 --> 55:12.147
7,000 dollars.

55:12.147 --> 55:14.625
I been with you all day
and I charge by the hour.

55:14.625 --> 55:16.269
I want my money.

55:16.269 --> 55:18.329
- You a call girl?

55:18.329 --> 55:21.124
I knew I seen her around
here somewhere before.

55:21.124 --> 55:23.612
That's why I told you to
leave her ass at the store.

55:23.612 --> 55:25.116
Did you even hit it?

55:25.116 --> 55:26.533
Did you smell it?

55:27.910 --> 55:30.793
'Cause 7,000 dollars,
Nephew, is, like, damn!

55:30.793 --> 55:31.793
- Call girl?

55:33.348 --> 55:34.471
You was with me all day.

55:34.471 --> 55:36.343
You were supposed to be
helpin' me find Adriana.

55:36.343 --> 55:37.580
Then I was gonna drop you
off to the photo shoot

55:37.580 --> 55:39.163
at the studio.
-  You a prostitute?

55:39.163 --> 55:40.074
Man, get the hell outta here.

55:40.074 --> 55:40.907
Stop!

55:40.907 --> 55:41.740
Get off of me.

55:41.740 --> 55:43.489
I'm not leavin' until I get my money.

55:43.489 --> 55:44.322
Oh, you're gettin' out of here.

55:44.322 --> 55:45.382
Get off of me!

55:45.382 --> 55:46.654
You gettin' out of here!

55:46.654 --> 55:48.833
- Chill, chill, chill.

55:48.833 --> 55:50.377
Prostitute?

55:50.377 --> 55:51.943
Really?

56:16.675 --> 56:18.195
- See, man, I told you.

56:18.195 --> 56:19.658
You shoulda called me when you got here.

56:19.658 --> 56:21.391
I coulda warned you about shit like that.

56:21.391 --> 56:22.518
- I did call you.

56:22.518 --> 56:23.589
You did not pick up.

56:23.589 --> 56:25.694
'Cause you owe me fifty dollars.

56:25.694 --> 56:26.928
- Thirty dollars.

56:26.928 --> 56:28.866
Hell, it shoulda been 20 how
you holdin' onto all those

56:28.866 --> 56:30.527
good quarterbacks.

56:30.527 --> 56:32.624
- Don't nobody hold on
to no good quarterbacks.

56:32.624 --> 56:33.955
Now, you had all the runnin' backs.

56:33.955 --> 56:35.068
It was fifty dollars.

56:35.068 --> 56:35.901
- Bullshit.

56:35.901 --> 56:37.054
You had Brees.

56:37.054 --> 56:37.990
You had Wilson.

56:37.990 --> 56:40.049
And you had Patrick Mahomes.

56:40.049 --> 56:43.242
- You just mad 'cause I didn't
trade you Jameis Winston.

56:43.242 --> 56:45.893
- Famous Crab Leg Jameis!

56:46.734 --> 56:47.749
- I don't have time for this.

56:47.749 --> 56:49.095
August, I don't got time-

56:49.095 --> 56:50.140
- What up, doe?

56:50.973 --> 56:52.170
- I think you got the wrong room.

56:52.170 --> 56:53.003
- What up, doe?

56:53.003 --> 56:54.291
- This is room 114.

56:54.291 --> 56:55.723
Hey, you from
Detroit or somethin'?

56:55.723 --> 56:58.524
- No, I got the right room.

56:58.524 --> 57:00.077
I'm here for my girl, August.

57:00.910 --> 57:02.756
I got some people from up that way.

57:02.756 --> 57:03.985
And that's how they talk.

57:03.985 --> 57:05.008
What up, doe?

57:05.008 --> 57:07.091
Detroit versus everybody.

57:08.135 --> 57:09.881
- I'm here for my homegirl
August right here.

57:09.881 --> 57:11.739
She said one of y'all in here owe me 7,000

57:11.739 --> 57:14.016

57:14.016 --> 57:14.963
That's crazy.

57:14.963 --> 57:15.796
She was just with me.

57:15.796 --> 57:16.629
I didn't know.

57:16.629 --> 57:17.900
If I woulda known that.

57:17.900 --> 57:20.403
I don't owe her 7,000 dollars, man.

57:21.236 --> 57:23.316
Man, she was just with me all day.

57:23.316 --> 57:24.449
- All day, huh?

57:24.449 --> 57:25.282
Yeah.

57:25.282 --> 57:26.482
- All day?

57:26.482 --> 57:28.815
That means she escorted you.

57:29.830 --> 57:31.256
I need that money.

57:31.256 --> 57:32.089
Man, I knew I recognized her.

57:32.089 --> 57:35.081
- Hey, keep your fuckin' hands down, man.

57:35.081 --> 57:36.648
She friends with

What is her name?

57:41.023 --> 57:41.856
Nina.

57:42.689 --> 57:44.526
Nina, that's right.

57:44.526 --> 57:45.701
Nina like the gun, man.

57:45.701 --> 57:47.673
Look, she got that money.

57:47.673 --> 57:49.173
And she cold, too.

57:51.162 --> 57:52.162
- Nina, huh?

57:53.543 --> 57:54.376
Nina.

57:54.376 --> 57:55.209
Nina, huh?

57:57.418 --> 58:00.501
You just sit right here for a minute.

58:04.766 --> 58:06.848
August actually say y'all was hungry.

58:09.202 --> 58:10.035
Hell yeah.

58:10.035 --> 58:11.236
I been locked up all day.

58:11.236 --> 58:13.050
I'm hungrier than a motherfucker.

58:13.050 --> 58:15.210
- Naw, man, we good.

58:15.210 --> 58:16.172
You ain't hungry?

58:16.172 --> 58:17.005

58:17.005 --> 58:17.838
You ain't hungry?

58:17.838 --> 58:19.266
- Naw, we're gonna chill here.

58:19.266 --> 58:21.029
Oh, okay, you're
gonna chill right here.

58:21.029 --> 58:22.112
Oh, okay.

58:22.112 --> 58:24.195
I got another suggestion.

58:29.110 --> 58:30.512
Your treat.

58:30.512 --> 58:32.088
Let's go.

58:43.563 --> 58:45.327
You know what, I'm a pretty cool guy,

58:45.327 --> 58:46.509
as long as I ain't mad.

58:46.509 --> 58:47.926
August, you know.

58:48.785 --> 58:49.618
You know.

58:49.618 --> 58:51.908
Now, I'ma ask you for the last time.

58:51.908 --> 58:53.075
Where is Nina?

58:54.071 --> 58:55.863
I don't know.

58:55.863 --> 58:57.111
I don't even like her like that.

58:57.111 --> 58:58.893
Why would I keep up with her?

58:58.893 --> 58:59.954
Bitch.

58:59.954 --> 59:02.997
That bitch got me for 160,000 of my money.

59:02.997 --> 59:05.424
Took that shit right outta my stash.

59:05.424 --> 59:07.224
And now I can't find her.

59:07.224 --> 59:09.459
That's why you're not
supposed to leave nobody

59:09.459 --> 59:12.607
in your motherfuckin' house
for a long period of time.

59:12.607 --> 59:14.146
Definitely a woman.

59:14.146 --> 59:14.979
I been lookin' for her.

59:14.979 --> 59:16.545
That's my top money maker.

59:16.545 --> 59:18.639
Now I can't find her.

59:18.639 --> 59:20.365
- Can you please stop
wavin' that gun around

59:20.365 --> 59:22.057
before somebody gets shot
in the back of the head

59:22.057 --> 59:24.040
like that dude in "Pulp Fiction"?

59:24.040 --> 59:27.001
Now, I know where Nina at.

59:27.001 --> 59:30.046
She at H.T.'s right about now.

59:30.046 --> 59:33.963
So you can go ahead and
drop us off right here.

59:37.453 --> 59:38.764
- Shut up.

59:38.764 --> 59:40.496
- I been up there all day.

59:40.496 --> 59:42.632
I been lookin' for her all week.

59:43.590 --> 59:46.293
Stop all that goddamn hiccupin'.

59:46.293 --> 59:48.072
Hiccup again, motherfucker.

59:48.072 --> 59:49.280
You drunk?

59:49.280 --> 59:51.447
Okay, I'll stop.

59:53.356 --> 59:55.170
- Now, listen.

59:55.170 --> 59:56.003
Listen.

59:56.003 --> 59:58.200
You definitely listen.

59:58.200 --> 59:59.533
I want my 7,000.

1:00:01.042 --> 1:00:05.209
I'll be at your hotel room
tomorrow to pick it up.

1:00:07.482 --> 1:00:08.482
You hear me?

1:00:10.491 --> 1:00:11.324
Get the fuck out.

1:00:11.324 --> 1:00:12.445
I got somethin' to show you.

1:00:38.965 --> 1:00:42.632

1:00:49.088 --> 1:00:51.522
Hello,

1:02:29.172 --> 1:02:30.746
Do you hear me?

1:02:30.746 --> 1:02:32.454

I'll see you back at the hotel.

1:02:40.895 --> 1:02:42.145
Tomorrow night.

1:02:43.820 --> 1:02:44.959
Where're we at?

1:02:45.792 --> 1:02:46.767
Man, that guy gotta be dead.

1:02:46.767 --> 1:02:47.882
We gotta call the police.

1:02:47.882 --> 1:02:50.504
Yeah, you can,
but not on my phone.

1:02:50.504 --> 1:02:51.406
Man, I just got outta jail.

1:02:51.406 --> 1:02:52.827
Use yours.

1:02:52.827 --> 1:02:54.751
- It's at the room.

1:02:54.751 --> 1:02:57.355
- Look, man, I don't
want no parts of this.

1:02:57.355 --> 1:02:58.486
You need to go back to Detroit

1:02:58.486 --> 1:02:59.991
before anything else happens.

1:03:01.036 --> 1:03:03.033
- He could still be alive.

1:03:03.033 --> 1:03:04.442
We should call the police.

1:03:04.442 --> 1:03:07.793
- Look, man, like I said,
you can call the police.

1:03:07.793 --> 1:03:08.858
Just not on my phone.

1:03:08.858 --> 1:03:10.543
Use somebody else's.

1:03:11.376 --> 1:03:12.298
- So, that's just it.

1:03:12.298 --> 1:03:13.414
And we gonna forget about August?

1:03:13.414 --> 1:03:14.608
We ain't gonna try to get her?

1:03:14.608 --> 1:03:15.441
- What?

1:03:15.441 --> 1:03:16.657
Nah, forget about her.

1:03:16.657 --> 1:03:18.673
She the reason we in the middle of this.

1:03:18.673 --> 1:03:20.631
Look, I don't give a shit about her.

1:03:20.631 --> 1:03:23.714
And I don't care what they do to her.

1:03:25.701 --> 1:03:26.534
- Well.

1:03:27.367 --> 1:03:28.371
- Look.

1:03:28.371 --> 1:03:29.871
Man, you like her?

1:03:31.463 --> 1:03:33.818
Aw, man, this boy in love.

1:03:33.818 --> 1:03:35.290
Man, she don't care about you.

1:03:35.290 --> 1:03:36.297
Don't you see that?

1:03:36.297 --> 1:03:37.914
She only care about money.

1:03:37.914 --> 1:03:38.747
You know what?

1:03:38.747 --> 1:03:41.409
You need to let that go and get back home.

1:03:41.409 --> 1:03:42.242
- You know what?

1:03:42.242 --> 1:03:43.857
Your friend Nina only
care about the money.

1:03:43.857 --> 1:03:45.060
Why don't she give that
back to Eugene so August

1:03:45.060 --> 1:03:46.469
don't get hurt?

1:03:46.469 --> 1:03:48.719
- Why you like her so much?

1:03:49.676 --> 1:03:52.312
- I cannot find Nina without you.

1:03:52.312 --> 1:03:54.927
And I just wanna make sure
August don't get hurt.

1:03:54.927 --> 1:03:55.760
- Look.

1:03:55.760 --> 1:03:56.593
Yes.

1:03:56.593 --> 1:03:58.715
I do know her cousin.

1:03:58.715 --> 1:04:01.770
And, yes, she did mention
Nina to me before.

1:04:04.382 --> 1:04:05.739
Damn, Nephew, I'm tired.

1:04:07.153 --> 1:04:08.347
Man, you done gave me the hiccups.

1:04:08.347 --> 1:04:09.534
Man, get away from me.

1:04:09.534 --> 1:04:10.367
- Unc.

1:04:10.367 --> 1:04:11.200
Unc!

1:04:43.938 --> 1:04:44.797
- It's dead.

1:04:44.797 --> 1:04:45.630
Damn.

1:04:48.720 --> 1:04:50.053
Where's outlets?

1:05:47.238 --> 1:05:49.071
Answer that.

1:05:54.865 --> 1:05:55.698
Hello?

1:05:57.438 --> 1:06:01.827
Man, ain't nobody ordered

1:06:01.827 --> 1:06:05.990
Look here, bitch, just

1:06:05.990 --> 1:06:06.823
Huh?

1:06:07.788 --> 1:06:10.620
There ain't no room service?

1:06:15.538 --> 1:06:17.900
Close them blinds, Neph.

1:06:17.900 --> 1:06:19.567
Why you up so early?

1:06:20.762 --> 1:06:22.262
- On Detroit time.

1:06:23.512 --> 1:06:26.188
Why you sleepin' on the floor?

1:06:26.188 --> 1:06:28.262
- Sleep like this 'cause
the dude was shootin'

1:06:28.262 --> 1:06:29.595
last night, man.

1:06:33.477 --> 1:06:36.827
- I gotta get that money for Adriana.

1:06:36.827 --> 1:06:38.062
I gotta raise two grand, bro.

1:06:38.062 --> 1:06:39.663
I gotta figure this out.

1:06:39.663 --> 1:06:42.888
- Well, man, we can get the money.

1:06:42.888 --> 1:06:44.988
We just gotta find Nina.

1:06:44.988 --> 1:06:46.327
- Nah.

1:06:46.327 --> 1:06:48.160
That's Eugene money, not mine.

1:06:48.160 --> 1:06:51.263
We don't want no parts of that.

1:06:51.263 --> 1:06:54.773
I'm gonna go back home,
see my regular doctor.

1:06:54.773 --> 1:06:57.931
- Okay, look, I still wanna find her.

1:06:57.931 --> 1:06:59.764
This dude got 160,000.

1:07:08.858 --> 1:07:11.941
I need about two grand today.

1:07:15.357 --> 1:07:18.107
- Oh, you need 2,000 dollars?

1:07:18.107 --> 1:07:19.357
Yeah.

1:07:30.465 --> 1:07:31.967
Yeah.

1:07:31.967 --> 1:07:34.057
So, look, check it.

1:07:34.057 --> 1:07:37.057
I got those Ox bolox for the fidean.

1:07:39.986 --> 1:07:41.569
Yo, all 30 in here?

1:07:44.175 --> 1:07:45.008
- Yeah.

1:07:46.464 --> 1:07:49.554
- Feels good, man, feels good.

1:07:50.860 --> 1:07:51.779
Okay, look-

1:07:51.779 --> 1:07:52.779
Oh, a stack?

1:07:54.514 --> 1:07:56.264
And eight honey buns?

1:07:57.530 --> 1:07:58.815
All right, sure.

1:07:58.815 --> 1:07:59.815
In a minute.

1:08:07.450 --> 1:08:09.033
1800 for the pills.

1:08:10.087 --> 1:08:13.119
So you only need 200 dollars.

1:08:13.119 --> 1:08:14.188
- Yeah.

1:08:14.188 --> 1:08:16.062
All right, I can trade in the rental.

1:08:16.062 --> 1:08:17.619
Grab like a minivan or somethin'.

1:08:17.619 --> 1:08:21.142
That should save me like
two or three hundred.

1:08:22.386 --> 1:08:23.344
and then bring it back

1:08:23.344 --> 1:08:24.552
Now look, Nephew.

1:08:24.552 --> 1:08:25.802
Next two exits.

1:08:27.609 --> 1:08:29.239
Come up on the next two exits.

1:08:29.239 --> 1:08:30.771
Spring Valley, a'ight?

1:08:32.477 --> 1:08:33.310
16, 17,

1:08:34.266 --> 1:08:35.099
18, 19,

1:08:36.434 --> 1:08:37.267
20.

1:08:37.267 --> 1:08:39.437
And a honey bun for the player.

1:08:39.437 --> 1:08:43.350
Nice doin' business with you, Nephew.

1:08:48.029 --> 1:08:50.374
It's all about the money, man!

1:08:50.374 --> 1:08:52.575
- Wait, why you get that?

1:08:52.575 --> 1:08:54.013
- Just like Denzel said.

1:08:54.013 --> 1:08:56.176
"Taxation without representation."

1:08:56.176 --> 1:08:58.516
It ain't nothin' free
in this world, Nephew.

1:08:58.516 --> 1:09:02.433
You lucky Uncle
Elbow-havin'-motherfucker, you!

1:09:18.523 --> 1:09:21.813
You ain't made me no money.

1:09:21.813 --> 1:09:22.646
None.

1:09:24.318 --> 1:09:25.151
What's up?

1:09:28.535 --> 1:09:29.368
You know.

1:09:30.676 --> 1:09:33.759
I been knowin' you for 10 months now.

1:09:34.607 --> 1:09:37.528
I ain't think it would be
this hard to break you.

1:09:37.528 --> 1:09:39.654
But you yet to make me some money.

1:09:39.654 --> 1:09:41.321
What's up with that?

1:09:43.151 --> 1:09:47.282
- It's because I'm not
a prostitute, Eugene.

1:09:47.282 --> 1:09:50.282
I see those other girls and I can't.

1:09:51.645 --> 1:09:52.728
I just can't.

1:09:54.069 --> 1:09:55.713
Take a shot.

1:09:55.713 --> 1:09:56.546
Relax.

1:09:56.546 --> 1:09:57.976
- I don't want it.

1:09:57.976 --> 1:09:58.809
I don't want it.

1:09:58.809 --> 1:10:00.809
- Take the fuckin' shot.

1:10:07.217 --> 1:10:10.278
Relax.

1:10:10.278 --> 1:10:12.510
'Bout time you let me hit that anyway.

1:10:12.510 --> 1:10:13.343
Relax.

1:10:13.343 --> 1:10:14.258
I just said relax.

1:10:14.258 --> 1:10:15.475
- Stop!

1:10:15.475 --> 1:10:18.397
- Didn't I tell you to relax?

1:10:18.397 --> 1:10:20.079
What you trippin' for?

1:10:20.079 --> 1:10:20.912
Come here.

1:10:27.222 --> 1:10:28.581
- No, no, no.

1:10:28.581 --> 1:10:29.414
Relax.

1:10:29.414 --> 1:10:30.247
Relax.

1:10:41.747 --> 1:10:42.580
Hey!

1:10:45.318 --> 1:10:46.916
What you doin'?

1:10:46.916 --> 1:10:48.166
Open this door.

1:10:50.604 --> 1:10:52.096
Open the fuckin' door!

1:10:54.319 --> 1:10:55.152
Relax!

1:10:55.152 --> 1:10:56.408
I said relax.

1:10:56.408 --> 1:10:58.159
Open the door.

1:11:05.592 --> 1:11:09.215
Man, this where Nina
actually stayin' right here.

1:11:09.215 --> 1:11:11.037
I was over here a while back
playin' cards, you know,

1:11:11.037 --> 1:11:13.038
drinkin' and all that.

1:11:13.038 --> 1:11:15.373
And I think her cousin like me too.

1:11:15.373 --> 1:11:16.206
Come on, man.

1:11:16.206 --> 1:11:17.623
Look at me, baby.

1:11:18.864 --> 1:11:19.745
You crazy, man.

1:11:19.745 --> 1:11:20.578
Oh yeah.

1:11:20.578 --> 1:11:24.474
Oh yeah.

1:11:35.751 --> 1:11:37.455
Who is it?

1:11:37.455 --> 1:11:39.288
Is Mia here?

1:11:40.735 --> 1:11:42.729
Who are you?

1:11:42.729 --> 1:11:43.562
Elbow.

1:11:43.562 --> 1:11:44.895
I'm Ant homeboy.

1:11:50.084 --> 1:11:50.917
- Elbow.

1:11:52.035 --> 1:11:54.096
Why you never call me?

1:11:54.096 --> 1:11:54.961
- I was drunk.

1:11:54.961 --> 1:11:57.771
And I lost my phone the
same night I left here.

1:11:57.771 --> 1:12:00.167
But, I remember where you stayed at.

1:12:00.167 --> 1:12:02.926
So, I thought I would drop by.

1:12:02.926 --> 1:12:04.093
So, here I am.

1:12:04.929 --> 1:12:06.652
This my nephew, Randy.

1:12:06.652 --> 1:12:07.569
Randy, Mia.

1:12:09.029 --> 1:12:09.946
Mia, Randy.

1:12:13.695 --> 1:12:14.528
- Come on.

1:12:16.381 --> 1:12:17.501
- Same body.

1:12:17.501 --> 1:12:18.418
Still cold.

1:12:19.828 --> 1:12:21.256
- Thank you.

1:12:21.256 --> 1:12:22.992
- I bet you can't shake
and bake that thing

1:12:22.992 --> 1:12:24.625
at the same time.

1:12:26.354 --> 1:12:27.921
- You was at the card game the other day.

1:12:27.921 --> 1:12:29.768
You saw me twerkin', that's why you here.

1:12:29.768 --> 1:12:31.226
- True, true.

1:12:31.226 --> 1:12:32.059
So go ahead.

1:12:32.059 --> 1:12:34.354
Let me get that Facebook Live
performance, baby, go ahead.

1:12:34.354 --> 1:12:35.452
Throw that thing down.

1:12:35.452 --> 1:12:36.684
Forget all that.

1:12:36.684 --> 1:12:37.851
Where is Nina?

1:12:38.976 --> 1:12:39.809
- What?

1:12:40.755 --> 1:12:42.659
Why you wanna know?

1:12:42.659 --> 1:12:43.516
You know what?

1:12:43.516 --> 1:12:45.179
It's time for y'all to leave.

1:12:45.179 --> 1:12:46.359
- Well, can you tell her
we got a message for her

1:12:46.359 --> 1:12:47.774
from Eugene?

1:12:47.774 --> 1:12:48.607
- Who the fuck are you?

1:12:49.440 --> 1:12:51.491
And why would you answer the door?

1:12:51.491 --> 1:12:53.756
If you don't leave right
now, I'll blow you away.

1:12:53.756 --> 1:12:55.522
- Look, Nina, hold on, look.

1:12:55.522 --> 1:12:57.608
We only here to tell you
that Eugene hold August

1:12:57.608 --> 1:12:59.553
until he gets his money back.

1:12:59.553 --> 1:13:00.386
- What money?

1:13:00.386 --> 1:13:01.719
That's my money.

1:13:03.990 --> 1:13:05.685
- Maybe if you would let
me speak, I could tell you

1:13:05.685 --> 1:13:07.568
what happened.

1:13:07.568 --> 1:13:09.694
Please, put the gun down.

1:13:09.694 --> 1:13:10.676
- I know Mia.

1:13:10.676 --> 1:13:11.710
Mia know me.

1:13:11.710 --> 1:13:12.636
We don't know him.

1:13:12.636 --> 1:13:15.351
Plus, I was tryin' to get
Mia to be my baby mama.

1:13:15.351 --> 1:13:17.018
- Mia, you know him?

1:13:18.238 --> 1:13:19.071
- Yeah.

1:13:19.071 --> 1:13:21.154
Let me put Mama gun back.

1:13:25.130 --> 1:13:26.797
- So, he killed him?

1:13:28.075 --> 1:13:30.408
From what we seen.

1:13:32.888 --> 1:13:35.547
We called 911, but we didn't stay.

1:13:35.547 --> 1:13:36.714
Because, well.

1:13:39.924 --> 1:13:40.757
You know.

1:13:42.132 --> 1:13:42.988
I know.

1:13:42.988 --> 1:13:44.071
I understand.

1:13:45.102 --> 1:13:46.961
I been tryin' to leave.

1:13:46.961 --> 1:13:50.309
I been waitin' on my
passport to come in the mail.

1:13:50.309 --> 1:13:52.100
I been sleepin' in my storage bin.

1:13:52.100 --> 1:13:55.951
I been checkin' my P.O. box for a week.

1:13:55.951 --> 1:13:58.389
I just came here just to
sleep in a normal house

1:13:58.389 --> 1:13:59.556
for one night.

1:14:00.849 --> 1:14:03.707
We and Zap 'posed to been gone.

1:14:03.707 --> 1:14:06.227
We was gonna start off
fresh in Puerto Rico.

1:14:06.227 --> 1:14:07.431
That's where he's from.

1:14:07.431 --> 1:14:08.387
His family is there.

1:14:10.382 --> 1:14:11.482
- Look.

1:14:11.482 --> 1:14:13.439
I'm drivin' you to Phoenix tonight.

1:14:13.439 --> 1:14:15.566
I'll bring your damn passport to you.

1:14:15.566 --> 1:14:18.995
Eugene will never see you again.

1:14:18.995 --> 1:14:20.188
- Shoulda been down there.

1:14:20.188 --> 1:14:21.021
Damn.

1:14:22.236 --> 1:14:23.069
- Nina.

1:14:25.249 --> 1:14:27.512
You should give him the money back.

1:14:27.512 --> 1:14:29.246
Are you crazy?

1:14:29.246 --> 1:14:32.118
That maniac just killed her dude.

1:14:32.118 --> 1:14:35.241
- Well, at least for August's sake.

1:14:35.241 --> 1:14:36.729
Do you really wanna be
lookin' over your shoulder

1:14:36.729 --> 1:14:39.396
for the rest of your life, Nina?

1:14:39.396 --> 1:14:41.400
- He's not gonna do nothin' to August.

1:14:41.400 --> 1:14:43.815
He been tryin' to fuck
her for the longest.

1:14:43.815 --> 1:14:45.228
- Look, Nina.

1:14:45.228 --> 1:14:47.390
You can buy a corvette with that money.

1:14:47.390 --> 1:14:49.385
You can even get icy with that money.

1:14:49.385 --> 1:14:51.372
You can even put a big
down payment on a race

1:14:51.372 --> 1:14:53.193
with that money.

1:14:53.193 --> 1:14:55.208
But it'd be wrong.

1:14:55.208 --> 1:14:57.206
So, look, Nina.

1:14:57.206 --> 1:15:00.746
What I need you to do
is just think about it.

1:15:00.746 --> 1:15:02.545
Today and tomorrow.

1:15:03.378 --> 1:15:05.412
Make sure you make a decision
that you can live with.

1:15:05.412 --> 1:15:06.245
Okay?

1:15:10.451 --> 1:15:11.284
- Okay.

1:15:17.228 --> 1:15:21.561
- Look, man, she said she
stayed in her storage bin.

1:15:22.619 --> 1:15:23.452
- Man, that's 'cause she's hidin'

1:15:23.452 --> 1:15:25.254
from that crazy motherfucker.

1:15:25.254 --> 1:15:28.337
- Yeah, but you're not thinkin', man.

1:15:29.216 --> 1:15:30.711
- Thinkin' about what?

1:15:30.711 --> 1:15:32.578
- Look, if that's where she stay,

1:15:32.578 --> 1:15:35.432
that's where the money is.

1:15:35.432 --> 1:15:36.821
- Yeah, no, see, I'm not doin' that.

1:15:36.821 --> 1:15:37.654
No, you crazy.

1:15:37.654 --> 1:15:38.487
I'm not.

1:15:38.487 --> 1:15:39.320
No.
- Why not?

1:15:39.320 --> 1:15:40.961
I thought you wanted to save August.

1:15:40.961 --> 1:15:43.565
- Look, I'm not gettin'
caught in no love triangles.

1:15:43.565 --> 1:15:47.190
I'ma just let Nina give him the money.

1:15:47.190 --> 1:15:48.967
- Look, man, if you believe that, Nephew.

1:15:48.967 --> 1:15:49.800
You a fool.

1:15:49.800 --> 1:15:52.050
Come on, let's just go see.

1:15:53.646 --> 1:15:55.986
Look, man, check this out.

1:15:56.819 --> 1:15:57.652
Self-Storage.

1:15:57.652 --> 1:15:58.969
Henderson, Nevada.

1:15:58.969 --> 1:16:01.486
Lot seven, locker 153.

1:16:01.486 --> 1:16:03.099
Let's just go see.

1:16:03.099 --> 1:16:04.120
- You took a pic?

1:16:04.120 --> 1:16:05.120
- Yes I did.

1:16:05.960 --> 1:16:06.960
- Slick ass.

1:16:08.733 --> 1:16:10.992
- So, look, let's get this
money and take it back

1:16:10.992 --> 1:16:12.075
to the hotel.

1:16:12.928 --> 1:16:14.178
And get August.

1:16:15.573 --> 1:16:16.406
- No.

1:16:16.406 --> 1:16:18.905
I'm just gonna go see Adriana.

1:16:18.905 --> 1:16:20.848
Nina will take the money back to him.

1:16:20.848 --> 1:16:21.984
I'm gonna go see her and then I'm goin'

1:16:21.984 --> 1:16:23.014
back to Detroit, man.

1:16:23.014 --> 1:16:23.847
That's it.

1:16:23.847 --> 1:16:24.775
- Okay. Well, hell.

1:16:24.775 --> 1:16:26.096
Just drop me off on the strip.

1:16:26.096 --> 1:16:27.176
Let me go get me a beer.

1:16:27.176 --> 1:16:28.464
And two shots.

1:16:36.123 --> 1:16:39.513
- This the doctor you was
talkin' about, Nephew?

1:16:41.359 --> 1:16:42.797
- Adriana?

1:16:42.797 --> 1:16:43.630
- Yes.

1:16:43.630 --> 1:16:45.700
How can I help you?

1:16:45.700 --> 1:16:47.067
- I need help with my hiccups.

1:16:47.067 --> 1:16:48.472
What the hell, Randy?

1:16:48.472 --> 1:16:50.597
You tellin' me we did all that for this?

1:16:50.597 --> 1:16:51.889
Shut up, man.

1:16:51.889 --> 1:16:52.722
- Please.

1:16:52.722 --> 1:16:54.222
Remove your shoes.

1:17:02.845 --> 1:17:05.169
- I can't believe you, Nephew.

1:17:05.169 --> 1:17:06.542
- Shut up, man.

1:17:06.542 --> 1:17:07.628
- How long have you had the hiccups

1:17:07.628 --> 1:17:09.448
and where you from?

1:17:09.448 --> 1:17:11.321
It's been about a month or so.

1:17:11.321 --> 1:17:12.405
From Detroit.

1:17:12.405 --> 1:17:14.231
My doctor said I had a
chronic case of the hiccups.

1:17:15.064 --> 1:17:17.524
And, I needed to try some home remedies,

1:17:17.524 --> 1:17:19.427
so I came to you.

1:17:19.427 --> 1:17:20.260
Do you have a cure?

1:17:20.260 --> 1:17:21.612
- Yes.

1:17:23.602 --> 1:17:24.435
- What do I have to do?

1:17:24.435 --> 1:17:26.268
How much does it cost?

1:17:28.898 --> 1:17:30.674
5,000 dollars.

1:17:30.674 --> 1:17:32.193
5,000?

1:17:32.193 --> 1:17:33.890
I thought the ad said it was 2,000.

1:17:33.890 --> 1:17:34.736
How did it go up?

1:17:34.736 --> 1:17:37.419
- Man, Randy, you crazy.

1:17:37.419 --> 1:17:38.369
- It is no simple.

1:17:38.369 --> 1:17:40.372
My services start at 2,000.

1:17:40.372 --> 1:17:42.494
I do not wish to sell myself short.

1:17:42.494 --> 1:17:43.590
- You damn right.

1:17:43.590 --> 1:17:45.348
And, if you smart, we'll leave.

1:17:45.348 --> 1:17:46.556
Randy, let's go.

1:17:46.556 --> 1:17:47.389
- No, that's stupid.

1:17:47.389 --> 1:17:48.222
Why would I leave?

1:17:48.222 --> 1:17:49.350
She has the cure.

1:17:49.350 --> 1:17:52.459
I had the money when I got here.

1:17:52.459 --> 1:17:54.310
Can I give you 2,000 now and
bring the rest back later?

1:17:54.310 --> 1:17:55.143
- Mm, no.

1:17:55.143 --> 1:17:57.528
Pay me in full or no
healing services for you.

1:17:57.528 --> 1:17:58.361
That's it.

1:17:58.361 --> 1:18:00.003
I'm gone.

1:18:00.916 --> 1:18:01.988
- Okay.

1:18:02.946 --> 1:18:04.698
I'ma go talk to my uncle.

1:18:04.698 --> 1:18:05.680
Be right back.

1:18:05.680 --> 1:18:07.316
- Man, this is a scam, Nephew.

1:18:07.316 --> 1:18:08.149
- No it's not.

1:18:08.149 --> 1:18:08.982
I believe her.

1:18:08.982 --> 1:18:10.065
She has a cure.

1:18:10.065 --> 1:18:11.950
- Well, look, she askin' for more money

1:18:11.950 --> 1:18:13.680
that you ain't got, so.

1:18:13.680 --> 1:18:14.513
- So?

1:18:14.513 --> 1:18:16.463
I know where the money at, remember?

1:18:16.463 --> 1:18:17.341
U-haul storage.

1:18:17.341 --> 1:18:18.197
Henderson, Nevada.

1:18:18.197 --> 1:18:19.030
Lot seven.

1:18:19.030 --> 1:18:19.947
Locker 153.

1:18:20.997 --> 1:18:22.123
I can go if you ain't down.

1:18:22.123 --> 1:18:22.956
- What?

1:18:22.956 --> 1:18:24.308
160,000 dollars?

1:18:24.308 --> 1:18:25.442
Hell yeah, I'm down.

1:18:26.512 --> 1:18:29.303
You ever have a fish taco before?

1:18:29.303 --> 1:18:31.309
Man, that's my favorite.

1:18:31.309 --> 1:18:32.142
If Coney Island don't got it,

1:18:32.142 --> 1:18:34.041
I ain't never had it.

1:18:34.041 --> 1:18:35.593
What about street corn?

1:18:35.593 --> 1:18:36.551
What's that?

1:18:36.551 --> 1:18:37.796
It's about
damn near the best corn

1:18:37.796 --> 1:18:39.923
you ever had in your life, boy.

1:18:39.923 --> 1:18:42.817
You can get it on the cob or
you can get it in the bowl.

1:18:42.817 --> 1:18:43.934
I like mine in the bowl.

1:18:43.934 --> 1:18:45.927
Get a little more corn at the bottom.

1:18:45.927 --> 1:18:46.760
Check.

1:18:46.760 --> 1:18:48.995
It's up there runnin'
with Grandma's fried corn.

1:18:48.995 --> 1:18:50.333
- No, no way.

1:18:50.333 --> 1:18:51.198
Hell naw.

1:18:51.198 --> 1:18:52.698
- Boy, I tell you.

1:18:54.735 --> 1:18:56.439
- I'ma have to try it.

1:18:59.112 --> 1:19:00.445
- So, look, man.

1:19:01.468 --> 1:19:02.380
What we gonna do with the money?

1:19:02.380 --> 1:19:03.878
We gonna split it?

1:19:03.878 --> 1:19:04.711
- Hell no, man.

1:19:04.711 --> 1:19:07.594
I'm payin' Adriana and I'm gonna
take the rest to the hotel.

1:19:07.594 --> 1:19:09.610
Then let Eugene know it's all there.

1:19:09.610 --> 1:19:10.476
- Man, come on, man.

1:19:10.476 --> 1:19:12.521
After all this runnin'
around I been doin'?

1:19:12.521 --> 1:19:14.320
I can at least get some to fix my ride?

1:19:14.320 --> 1:19:16.226
- Okay, I'll give you a thousand.

1:19:16.226 --> 1:19:17.603
A thousand dollars?

1:19:17.603 --> 1:19:18.909
You gon' give me a thousand dollars?

1:19:18.909 --> 1:19:19.916
- Yes.

1:19:19.916 --> 1:19:21.755
- Look, man, I'm tryin' to
drop a new engine in that thing

1:19:21.755 --> 1:19:23.282
and put candy paint on it.

1:19:34.122 --> 1:19:36.722
Them fish tacos were slappin'.

1:19:36.722 --> 1:19:37.640
I told you, Nephew.

1:19:37.640 --> 1:19:40.587
I ain't gonna steer you wrong, baby.

1:19:40.587 --> 1:19:44.425
Hey, that look like old girl
that we saw at the tent.

1:19:44.425 --> 1:19:45.801
You know what though?

1:19:45.801 --> 1:19:47.411
Coney Island got a better fish sandwich.

1:19:47.411 --> 1:19:49.297
- Man, who in the hell
order a fish sandwich

1:19:49.297 --> 1:19:50.980
from Coney Island, man?

1:19:50.980 --> 1:19:54.470
I always get that cheeseburger
deluxe or that coney special.

1:19:54.470 --> 1:19:57.738
But, you know what I do need right now?

1:19:57.738 --> 1:20:00.816
That buzz ball cold, Nephew.

1:20:00.816 --> 1:20:02.129
- How did we not see anything?

1:20:02.129 --> 1:20:03.089
All that for nothing.

1:20:03.089 --> 1:20:05.314
- Look, man, obviously
it's not there, Nephew.

1:20:05.314 --> 1:20:06.707
She took it with her.

1:20:06.707 --> 1:20:08.097
So, look, let's go back over there.

1:20:08.097 --> 1:20:10.258
I'll distract Mia while
you go look for the money.

1:20:10.258 --> 1:20:11.508
How 'bout that?

1:20:25.984 --> 1:20:28.524
She want more
money than you ain't got, so.

1:20:28.524 --> 1:20:29.357
So?

1:20:29.357 --> 1:20:30.799
I know where the rest of the money at.

1:20:30.799 --> 1:20:33.200
Henderson, Nevada U-haul storage.

1:20:33.200 --> 1:20:34.033
Lot seven.

1:20:34.033 --> 1:20:35.783
Locker 153, remember?

1:20:37.837 --> 1:20:39.049
Uncle.

1:20:39.049 --> 1:20:41.488
When's the last time you saw Adriana?

1:20:41.488 --> 1:20:43.542
I thought I seen
her up at the taco patio.

1:20:43.542 --> 1:20:44.375
- Are you sure?

1:20:44.375 --> 1:20:46.510
Man, I'm positive, Nephew.

1:20:53.789 --> 1:20:56.029
Look, man, this is where I seen her.

1:20:56.029 --> 1:20:58.319
I seen her right here.

1:20:58.319 --> 1:21:00.380
Are you sure
you seen her right here?

1:21:00.380 --> 1:21:01.213
- Man, look, there she goes!

1:21:01.213 --> 1:21:02.171
Just gettin' on the bus there.

1:21:02.171 --> 1:21:03.261
And she got the money.

1:21:03.261 --> 1:21:04.094
Hurry up!

1:21:04.094 --> 1:21:05.344
Pull over, man!

Go.

1:21:19.486 --> 1:21:20.705
Go, go, go, go, go!

1:21:20.705 --> 1:21:22.237
The little sneaky ass.

1:21:22.237 --> 1:21:23.335
Man, call her phone.

1:21:23.335 --> 1:21:24.455
Shit.

1:21:25.321 --> 1:21:26.958
Please
leave your message for-

1:21:26.958 --> 1:21:29.323
Shit, she
pushed me to voicemail.

1:21:29.323 --> 1:21:31.938
Man, do a Hellcat
donut in front of the bus stop.

1:21:31.938 --> 1:21:33.265
Man, I'm just gonna go up
there and I'm just gonna hit

1:21:33.265 --> 1:21:35.520
her ass in the head and
just gonna hop off the bus

1:21:35.520 --> 1:21:36.538
and take the money.

1:21:36.538 --> 1:21:37.764
Why would I do that?

1:21:37.764 --> 1:21:38.597
That's bringin' too much attention.

1:21:38.597 --> 1:21:40.094
Why don't we just wait
'til she get off the bus?

1:21:40.094 --> 1:21:41.353
Park at the next stop.

1:21:41.353 --> 1:21:43.191
Let me out and I'm gonna run
up and hit her ass in the head

1:21:43.191 --> 1:21:44.274
with your shoe.

1:21:44.274 --> 1:21:46.336
It's just gonna look
like she sleep anyway.

1:21:47.211 --> 1:21:48.268
You sound crazy.

1:21:48.268 --> 1:21:50.036
Did you forget she saw your face?

1:21:50.036 --> 1:21:51.618
Why don't we just follow behind the bus?

1:21:51.618 --> 1:21:53.897
Look, man, there she go!

1:22:06.724 --> 1:22:08.816

Go and get the van!

1:23:25.913 --> 1:23:26.746

1:23:28.230 --> 1:23:30.695
That's down the street.

1:24:01.197 --> 1:24:02.292
Did he say anything to you?

1:24:02.292 --> 1:24:04.625
- Yes and he took the box.

1:24:04.625 --> 1:24:05.765

1:24:05.765 --> 1:24:06.723
- Yes.

1:24:06.723 --> 1:24:08.405
- Okay, so now I have

1:24:08.405 --> 1:24:09.857
Can I get it?

1:24:09.857 --> 1:24:10.868

1:24:10.868 --> 1:24:12.763

1:24:16.951 --> 1:24:18.469
What, that's insane.

1:24:18.469 --> 1:24:20.136
Why you go up on me?

1:24:21.123 --> 1:24:23.332
Could you just ride with

1:24:23.332 --> 1:24:24.165

1:24:24.165 --> 1:24:24.998
- No.

1:24:24.998 --> 1:24:27.140
I don't need a ride.

1:24:27.140 --> 1:24:29.508

Adriana was right there and

1:25:26.797 --> 1:25:27.689
- Not all of it.

1:25:27.689 --> 1:25:29.455
Look, we can split it.

Ain't nothin' gonna happen to her.

1:25:39.739 --> 1:25:40.572

1:25:40.572 --> 1:25:41.405
That's where you're wrong.

1:29:04.395 --> 1:29:06.871
or sneak out the back
door with your slick ass.

1:29:06.871 --> 1:29:08.010
- Where is the money?

1:29:18.365 --> 1:29:19.198
Please.

1:29:19.198 --> 1:29:20.212
Lay here.

1:29:20.212 --> 1:29:22.929
Put your arms to your side.

1:30:06.895 --> 1:30:08.062
- Tastes good.

1:30:52.671 --> 1:30:53.955
- I see.

1:30:53.955 --> 1:30:55.955
It was stress all along.

1:31:04.732 --> 1:31:05.565
- Hell.

1:31:05.565 --> 1:31:07.325
Well, I'll be.

1:31:07.325 --> 1:31:08.158
- Shh.

1:31:26.777 --> 1:31:29.052
Yo, I can't believe it, man.

1:31:29.052 --> 1:31:29.885
She really did it.

1:31:29.885 --> 1:31:32.414
Hey, I can't believe
Adriana cured you, man.

1:31:32.414 --> 1:31:35.064
Next time I'm stressed out,
I'm goin' straight to her.

1:31:35.064 --> 1:31:36.927
I ain't goin' to no liquor store, man.

1:31:36.927 --> 1:31:37.760
Mm mm.

1:31:37.760 --> 1:31:40.122
- See, that's why you gotta
trust those home remedies.

1:31:40.122 --> 1:31:42.096
Everything Grandma talk about works.

1:31:42.096 --> 1:31:44.499
- Yeah, but this dude on the
internet said that he can

1:31:44.499 --> 1:31:48.077
pass a drug test with syrup called Certo.

1:31:48.077 --> 1:31:50.716
Said it was nasty and
to mix it with juice.

1:31:50.716 --> 1:31:53.086
But I was gonna comment and
ask him can I mix it with

1:31:53.086 --> 1:31:54.418
rum and coke.

1:31:54.418 --> 1:31:56.154
Drink it right before I go.

1:31:56.154 --> 1:31:57.974
And feelin' right.

1:31:57.974 --> 1:32:00.016
Rum and coke
before your drug test?

1:32:00.016 --> 1:32:01.713
Unc, you crazy as hell, man.

1:32:01.713 --> 1:32:04.262
No, not literally right before.

1:32:04.262 --> 1:32:06.959
But drink it four hours
before you take the test.

1:32:06.959 --> 1:32:08.602
You know what it was?

1:32:08.602 --> 1:32:11.577
It was probably that oil
she gave you that did it.

1:32:11.577 --> 1:32:13.982
I wonder if it was CBD oil.

1:32:13.982 --> 1:32:16.999
She said it was the stress,
so I'd just smoke mines

1:32:16.999 --> 1:32:17.832
in a oil pen.

1:32:20.041 --> 1:32:21.374
- Who is it?

1:32:21.374 --> 1:32:23.150
Room service.

1:32:23.150 --> 1:32:25.983
We didn't order nothin'.

1:32:32.182 --> 1:32:35.432
- I know you didn't, but you gotta pay.

1:32:39.084 --> 1:32:39.917
Damn.

1:32:39.917 --> 1:32:40.750
Where you from?

1:32:40.750 --> 1:32:41.583
Cali.

1:32:41.583 --> 1:32:42.522
You got a man?

1:32:42.522 --> 1:32:44.552
- You only gonna see me one time.

1:32:44.552 --> 1:32:48.444
Oh, you one of them girls, huh?

1:32:48.444 --> 1:32:51.108
Oh, shit, you a killer?

1:32:51.108 --> 1:32:52.759
Why I keep attractin' murderers?

1:32:52.759 --> 1:32:54.870
Man, I'm gonna start online datin',

1:32:54.870 --> 1:32:56.651
so I can do background checks.

1:32:56.651 --> 1:32:57.738
What up doe?

1:32:57.738 --> 1:32:58.633
- You can't say that.

1:32:58.633 --> 1:33:00.823
You ain't from the D.

1:33:00.823 --> 1:33:02.947
- Where's August?

1:33:02.947 --> 1:33:03.780
- Know what?

1:33:03.780 --> 1:33:07.454
I knew you was gonna ask about her.

1:33:07.454 --> 1:33:08.954
Where my money at?

1:33:11.502 --> 1:33:13.585
It's all there.

1:33:18.134 --> 1:33:19.884
- Where's my 160,000?

1:33:21.799 --> 1:33:22.632
Look.

1:33:22.632 --> 1:33:24.690
All I owe is 7,000 for August.

1:33:24.690 --> 1:33:27.690
I don't got nothin' to do with that.

1:33:30.863 --> 1:33:32.941
- You know what, you right.

1:33:32.941 --> 1:33:35.630
But how did you get 7,000?

1:33:35.630 --> 1:33:36.539
- Hold on, man.

1:33:36.539 --> 1:33:37.936
Hey, we just got rid
of his pain pills, man.

1:33:37.936 --> 1:33:40.275
A couple Oxys for a couple thousand.

1:33:40.275 --> 1:33:42.039
And sold about six pair of my Yeezy's.

1:33:42.039 --> 1:33:46.956
Here, look, word on the street
is Nina at her auntie house.

1:33:48.857 --> 1:33:49.690
- Who told you that?

1:33:49.690 --> 1:33:50.934
Look, man, I ain't Tekashi 6x9,

1:33:50.934 --> 1:33:51.895
but the streets is talkin'.

1:33:51.895 --> 1:33:52.791
What you gonna do?

1:33:52.791 --> 1:33:54.967
Kill everybody on the street?

1:33:54.967 --> 1:33:55.800
- Okay.

1:33:56.746 --> 1:33:57.829
Auntie Helen.

1:33:58.824 --> 1:33:59.799
Auntie Helen.

1:33:59.799 --> 1:34:02.139
Damn, I didn't think of that.

1:34:02.139 --> 1:34:03.476
You better be right.

1:34:03.476 --> 1:34:05.349
You better be fuckin' right.

1:34:05.349 --> 1:34:06.182
Let's go.

1:34:16.291 --> 1:34:17.393
You fuckin' liar.

1:34:17.393 --> 1:34:18.647
- Man, what the hell was I supposed to do?

1:34:18.647 --> 1:34:19.978
I had to think quick.

1:34:19.978 --> 1:34:21.511
- Yeah, 'cause you don't
got no fuckin' Yeezy's.

1:34:21.511 --> 1:34:24.352
- I will as soon as you give
me that big bag of money.

1:34:27.231 --> 1:34:28.064
Who is it?

1:34:28.064 --> 1:34:28.982
August.

1:34:28.982 --> 1:34:29.815
You by yourself?

1:34:29.815 --> 1:34:31.065
Yes.

1:34:36.031 --> 1:34:36.989
Thank you.

1:34:36.989 --> 1:34:37.822
Thank you.

1:34:37.822 --> 1:34:41.684
Not gonna leave you by yourself.

1:34:41.684 --> 1:34:42.923
Come on, Randy,
you need to take your

1:34:42.923 --> 1:34:44.958
nasty ass home.

1:34:44.958 --> 1:34:45.791
Come on, let's count this money.

1:34:45.791 --> 1:34:47.996
Spread it out so we can get up outta here.

1:34:47.996 --> 1:34:50.829
Get outta this hot ass hotel room.

1:34:54.923 --> 1:34:57.063
Matter-of-fact, man, let's go.

1:34:57.063 --> 1:34:59.702
- Wanna come back to Detroit with me?

1:34:59.702 --> 1:35:00.825
Look, y'all
need to just quit all that

1:35:00.825 --> 1:35:02.439
"Jason Lyric" love bullshit.

1:35:02.439 --> 1:35:03.754
Let's go.

1:35:40.984 --> 1:35:42.401
- Babe, gotta go.

1:35:44.247 --> 1:35:45.247
- All right.

1:35:46.656 --> 1:35:49.171
So, I just gotta hang
the new clothes up, but,

1:35:49.171 --> 1:35:51.319
you know then I'll get a little break.

1:35:51.319 --> 1:35:52.654
Gonna come have lunch with me?

1:35:52.654 --> 1:35:53.487
- I want to.

1:35:53.487 --> 1:35:54.695
I'ma try.

1:35:54.695 --> 1:35:57.012
Just gotta see if these rides are done.

1:35:57.012 --> 1:35:58.107
You know what, just text me.

1:35:58.107 --> 1:36:00.625
I'ma see if I'm done and
then I can come over.

1:36:00.625 --> 1:36:01.458
- All right.

1:36:01.458 --> 1:36:02.458
- All right.

1:36:04.059 --> 1:36:06.936
- I was also wondering if, maybe,

1:36:06.936 --> 1:36:09.249
I could have a few dollars.

1:36:09.249 --> 1:36:11.796
Just in case, you know, if I
wanna buy any of the new stuff.

1:36:11.796 --> 1:36:12.676
- Right, right.

1:36:12.676 --> 1:36:14.384
I knew it was comin', so.

1:36:14.384 --> 1:36:16.229
- I wanna look good for you, though.

1:36:16.229 --> 1:36:18.147
- I wanna look good.

1:36:19.936 --> 1:36:21.890
All right, here.

1:36:21.890 --> 1:36:22.723
- Thank you.

1:36:22.723 --> 1:36:24.973
- I'll be back.
- Love you.

1:36:27.049 --> 1:36:28.507
- Have fun today.

1:36:28.507 --> 1:36:29.340
All right.

1:36:40.649 --> 1:36:41.482
- Hey girl.

1:36:41.482 --> 1:36:42.899
Hey.

1:37:07.092 --> 1:37:09.180

1:37:09.180 --> 1:37:10.222
Randy, right?

1:37:10.222 --> 1:37:11.055
- Yeah.

1:37:11.055 --> 1:37:12.073
- Little late, Randy.

1:37:12.073 --> 1:37:13.822
I got an interview I need to be at.

1:37:13.822 --> 1:37:14.655
- Traffic.

1:37:14.655 --> 1:37:15.488
Sorry, man.

1:37:15.488 --> 1:37:16.779
- It's all right. It's okay.

1:37:16.779 --> 1:37:18.898
I got another address for you.

1:37:18.898 --> 1:37:22.368
That way we won't be havin' any problems.

1:37:22.368 --> 1:37:23.650
Right, man?

1:37:23.650 --> 1:37:24.483
That's cool.

1:37:24.483 --> 1:37:26.004
Yeah?

1:37:26.004 --> 1:37:27.939
You look familiar.

1:37:27.939 --> 1:37:30.411
- Uh, I grew up around here.

1:37:30.411 --> 1:37:31.244
- You play?

1:37:31.244 --> 1:37:32.077
You play ball?

1:37:32.077 --> 1:37:32.910
- Yeah, yeah I do.

1:37:32.910 --> 1:37:33.743
- The park.

1:37:33.743 --> 1:37:34.576
- Yeah.

1:37:34.576 --> 1:37:35.525
- About six months ago.

1:37:35.525 --> 1:37:38.784
You was in the dress shoes
and you killed them dudes.

1:37:38.784 --> 1:37:39.617
Oh man.

1:37:40.450 --> 1:37:41.283
- What's up, man, how you doin'?

1:37:41.283 --> 1:37:42.116
That's crazy.

1:37:42.116 --> 1:37:43.315
Oh my goodness.

1:37:43.315 --> 1:37:44.148
Them dudes.

1:37:44.148 --> 1:37:45.509
Hey, they took 400 from me last time.

1:37:47.283 --> 1:37:48.116
Yeah.

1:37:48.116 --> 1:37:51.100
- He bigger, stronger, just as fast.

1:37:51.100 --> 1:37:53.547
He got better hops and
he catch way better.

1:37:53.547 --> 1:37:54.380
- No he don't.

1:37:54.380 --> 1:37:55.213
- Yes he do.

1:37:55.213 --> 1:37:57.897
- All right, but he catch one handed.

1:37:57.897 --> 1:37:59.533
- Okay, and?

1:37:59.533 --> 1:38:00.391
- Who you think better?

1:38:00.391 --> 1:38:01.420
Julio or O'Dell?

1:38:01.420 --> 1:38:03.392
- Man, you already know it's Julio, bro.

1:38:03.392 --> 1:38:05.309
- Uh, I'm not too sure.

1:38:06.597 --> 1:38:09.014
- 'Bout to pop it right here.

1:38:10.342 --> 1:38:11.908
- Little boy, you can't pop me.

1:38:11.908 --> 1:38:12.741

1:38:16.073 --> 1:38:16.906
- Hey, hey, hey, chill.

1:38:16.906 --> 1:38:17.739
Y'all.

1:38:17.739 --> 1:38:19.576
Let me just get y'all to practice.

1:38:19.576 --> 1:38:22.575
- Why's he goin' on the field?

1:38:57.603 --> 1:38:58.436
- Hey.

1:38:58.436 --> 1:38:59.269
- Hey.

1:38:59.269 --> 1:39:00.404
- Hey.
- Hi.

1:39:00.404 --> 1:39:02.320
- I mean, I think black
because you can't see black

1:39:02.320 --> 1:39:03.987
through your outfit.

1:39:05.637 --> 1:39:09.692
- I know, but red is
just, like, more sexy.

1:39:09.692 --> 1:39:13.359
- Yeah, but black you
can't see them at all.

1:39:14.923 --> 1:39:16.923
- Well, I still say red.

1:39:17.906 --> 1:39:20.109
Sexual attraction.

1:39:20.109 --> 1:39:23.654
- Okay, but black is more of a mystery.

1:39:23.654 --> 1:39:24.487
Hey, you're a man.

1:39:24.487 --> 1:39:25.801
What do you think?

1:39:25.801 --> 1:39:27.491
Black for a mystery?

1:39:27.491 --> 1:39:29.991
Or red for instant attraction?

1:39:31.316 --> 1:39:32.890
- Uh.

1:39:32.890 --> 1:39:34.307
Mystery, I guess.

1:39:35.608 --> 1:39:40.608
- See, I like to feel good all
the way down to my underwear.

1:39:41.266 --> 1:39:42.099
What about you?

1:39:42.099 --> 1:39:43.849
What color are yours?

1:39:48.876 --> 1:39:52.063
I'm not wearing
any panties.

1:39:52.063 --> 1:39:52.896
- Okay.

1:39:54.896 --> 1:39:55.729
Where to?

1:40:33.158 --> 1:40:34.570
- Good evening.

1:40:34.570 --> 1:40:38.293
So we're going to Metro
Detroit Airport, right?

1:40:38.293 --> 1:40:40.118
- So, wasn't you the one
that told me I don't wanna

1:40:40.118 --> 1:40:43.939
look over my shoulders
for the rest of my life?

1:40:45.756 --> 1:40:46.923
- What up doe?

1:41:06.275 --> 1:41:08.433
