A few years back, Gerald's dad
was trying anything he could
to make a quick buck.

34:27.233 --> 34:31.337
Hello. This is Ed from the bank.
Could you give me
your account number, please?

he was hit with an idea.

Poor thing.
It's dead.

That bird was as dead
as a doornail, and my son

[ Earl Narrating ] By the time
we went to see Gerald, the
miracle business was booming.

35:22.554 --> 35:26.692
But as it turned out, Gerald's
dad needed a little help to keep
the miracles coming.

35:26.758 --> 35:30.762
Hey, dirtbag.
Wanna make some real money?

35:32.097 --> 35:35.201
Hang on. Hang on.
Let me see you limp.

Okay. But you're only
gonna look, right?

If Joy knew it was a scam,

35:52.117 --> 35:53.852
she would've made me
split the money.

35:53.919 --> 35:56.255
So I told 'em I tripped
on some Japanese twins.

35:56.322 --> 35:58.290
Plus, I couldn't
ruin the night for Randy.

35:58.357 --> 36:02.494
I hadn't seen that look on his
face since I blew his mind with
the magic of "Got your nose."

36:02.561 --> 36:05.997
So, his powers
only work on birds?

36:06.064 --> 36:09.067
No. That's not true.
'Cause he touched
my monster zit,

36:09.134 --> 36:11.703
and the next morning
it was dried up
and on my pillow.

36:11.770 --> 36:16.174
Yeah, I used to put
some pharmaceutical-grade
Neosporin on the kid's hands.

36:16.242 --> 36:18.176
Carter,
how could you lie to us?

36:18.244 --> 36:22.248
How could you lie
and cheat sick people
out of thousands of dollars?

36:23.882 --> 36:26.117
I'm done.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.554
I-I don't have powers anymore.

36:28.620 --> 36:31.323
I'm done.

36:31.390 --> 36:33.659
Look.
I'm sorry I couldn't
heal your brother.

36:33.725 --> 36:38.129
But this is great.
I can finally be a normal kid.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.499
And what's so great about that?

36:40.566 --> 36:44.870
Everything, Dad.
I wear plastic gloves
on my hands.

36:44.936 --> 36:49.408
To school. And the only people
who talk to me
are the cafeteria ladies.

to begin with.
