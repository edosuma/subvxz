22:17.937 --> 22:19.503
I wouldn't even
be able to menstruate.

22:19.505 --> 22:23.107
My eggs would be all dry
and just refusing to come out.

22:23.109 --> 22:25.876
That's how lean
I really am, right now.

22:27.080 --> 22:29.413
                  Okay, I just--

22:29.415 --> 22:30.481
You don't
have to talk anymore.

22:30.483 --> 22:32.650
 Just lift up your shirt.

22:32.652 --> 22:34.919
I want to talk to
that fat of yours face-to-face.

22:34.921 --> 22:36.420
    I just don't really--
       Just lift it up.

22:36.422 --> 22:37.922
I've seen lots of
this kind of thing.

22:37.924 --> 22:39.123
   Oh.
   Oh, my God.

22:39.125 --> 22:40.524
     Oh, Jesus.

22:40.526 --> 22:41.892
I didn't expect to have
that reaction.

22:41.894 --> 22:42.993
          I'm sorry.
        I can put it--

22:42.995 --> 22:45.563
No, no.
No, no, it's all good.

22:45.565 --> 22:47.832
Well, look at that,
you have a muffin top.

22:47.834 --> 22:49.934
Hey, there,
little muffin top.

22:49.936 --> 22:51.469
How you doing,
little muffin top?

22:51.471 --> 22:52.703
 What you got down there?

22:52.705 --> 22:54.705
Is that blueberries
or cranberries in there.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.040
           Ohh!

22:56.042 --> 22:57.475
               You know, I just
         really don't even know

22:57.477 --> 22:58.709
       why they have to call it
                  a muffin top.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.411
                    I just wish
    they'd call it a Satan top.

23:00.413 --> 23:01.545
                    That's what
           it feels like to me.

23:01.547 --> 23:03.481
Fine, fine. Satan top.
Use that.

23:03.483 --> 23:06.083
Look, your mind
created this dis--

23:06.085 --> 23:07.485
please, pull that down.

23:07.487 --> 23:10.588
Your mind,
it created that disgusting

23:10.590 --> 23:12.857
blueberry-filled
muffin top.

23:12.859 --> 23:13.858
 It is yours to name.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.159
                           Okay.

23:15.161 --> 23:18.629
I want you to send in
to my lab your stool sample.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.715
                   Eugh.

23:20.716 --> 23:22.800
And most importantly,
I want you to begin each day

23:22.802 --> 23:26.737
by drinking two fluid ounces
of your own urine.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.973
                          What?
                   No. Oh, God.

23:28.975 --> 23:30.441
          Oh, I can't, I can't,
                   I can't, no.

23:30.443 --> 23:31.709
Now, look,
it's simple to do this.

23:31.711 --> 23:33.744
All you do, most of my clients
they just take it,

23:33.746 --> 23:35.112
they take the two ounces,

23:35.113 --> 23:36.479
they dump it
in their morning latté,

23:36.482 --> 23:37.581
just chuck it down.

23:37.583 --> 23:38.849
Never even know
the difference.

23:38.851 --> 23:41.085
Others make themselves
what they call a "pee tea"

23:41.087 --> 23:44.088
and heat it in the kettle
on that stove.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.524
Because Gandhi
drank his morning pee

23:46.526 --> 23:48.092
every single morning.

23:48.094 --> 23:49.527
                 Mahatma Gandhi?

23:49.529 --> 23:52.763
Yes, and now think back to
how thin Gandhi was.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.131
                      Okay.

23:54.132 --> 23:55.498
Hold on.
Stay on the ball.

23:55.501 --> 24:00.838
Now, I need you to mail me
your stool sample

24:00.840 --> 24:01.839
<i> in this envelope.</i>

24:01.841 --> 24:03.007
<i> It is self-sealing.</i>

24:03.009 --> 24:06.477
Do not do as many people do
and lick it.

24:06.479 --> 24:09.513
And this, right here,
these are your supplements.

24:09.515 --> 24:10.648
                    SUZANNE:
                    All right.
       Okay.

24:10.650 --> 24:11.733
               I'll do it.

24:11.734 --> 24:12.817
It really was a pleasure
to meet you.

24:12.819 --> 24:14.785
                     Thank you.
      It was so nice-thank you.

24:14.787 --> 24:15.986
             I'm truly grateful.

24:15.988 --> 24:18.155
               Oh, look, sorry.
                 I'm just not--

24:18.157 --> 24:19.824
I would stand first,
but in my culture,

24:19.826 --> 24:22.226
it's appropriate for women
to stand before men.

24:22.228 --> 24:24.061
          Look, I just--I'm not
 good at the ball thing but I--

24:24.063 --> 24:25.463
               thank you.

24:25.465 --> 24:26.864
Thank you so much.
I'm really grateful.

24:28.167 --> 24:29.200
       Mmm.

24:29.202 --> 24:31.635
You will be pretty someday.

24:34.841 --> 24:38.008
  It's our new house, buddy.
      What do you think?

24:38.010 --> 24:39.610
   Want to give Mommy kisses?

24:39.612 --> 24:41.779
   BooBoo, give Mommy a kiss.

24:41.781 --> 24:43.948
      Oh, there's a kissy.

24:43.950 --> 24:45.549
    Oh, not with the tongue.

24:45.551 --> 24:46.817
   That's confusing to Mommy.

24:46.819 --> 24:47.885
           Oh, yeah.

24:54.093 --> 24:55.893
  Come on, you son of a bitch.

25:10.243 --> 25:12.142
           Oh, Jesus.

25:12.144 --> 25:15.980
        Here, let me.
           No, no.

25:15.982 --> 25:17.147
    I'm so sorry.

25:17.149 --> 25:18.782
That was so weird.
I just--

25:18.784 --> 25:21.986
I have this thing where, like,
if I don't see it go in,

25:21.988 --> 25:24.188
I just Gaslight myself,

25:24.190 --> 25:26.056
like this old
black and white movie.

25:26.058 --> 25:29.894
      Yeah, where Charles Boyer
   tries to make Ingrid Bergman

25:29.896 --> 25:31.795
      think she's crazy.
             Yes.

25:31.797 --> 25:33.898
    I love that movie.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.733
  Me too.

25:35.735 --> 25:37.635
                      I thought
          I was the only person

25:37.637 --> 25:40.538
       who Gaslights themselves
                at the mailbox.

25:40.540 --> 25:41.972
 I totally do that.

25:41.974 --> 25:44.141
     It's just some stupid crap
                I have to send,

25:44.143 --> 25:46.143
                I'm treating it
                like it's gold.

25:46.145 --> 25:48.145
            Did it go in there?
                    Am I crazy?

25:48.147 --> 25:51.615
 Yeah, it's just some crap.

25:54.921 --> 25:56.287
  Thank you.

25:56.289 --> 25:57.621
                 You're welcome.

25:58.991 --> 26:00.024
    Morning.

26:00.026 --> 26:01.091
     ( GIGGLING )
     See ya.

26:03.829 --> 26:07.631
Decaf, double shot,
no foam, skinny latté

26:07.633 --> 26:10.134
with extra room like
you asked for it three times

26:10.136 --> 26:12.336
even though I heard you
the first time.

26:12.338 --> 26:13.704
                 Thank you.

26:18.678 --> 26:20.210
      Oh no, you don't.
            What?
           I-what?

26:20.212 --> 26:21.679
JAROD: <i> I saw what you poured</i>
<i> in that.</i>

26:21.681 --> 26:24.615
That is a decaf, non-fat,
skinny pee pee latté.

26:24.617 --> 26:25.749
                   How on earth
             did you even know?

26:25.751 --> 26:27.017
I run a coffee shop
in West L.A.

26:27.019 --> 26:29.887
I see every crazy diet fad
that comes in here

26:29.889 --> 26:32.156
and that Gregory tells people
to spend $300

26:32.158 --> 26:33.791
to drink their own urine?

26:33.793 --> 26:35.025
I mean, no wonder
they lose weight.

26:35.027 --> 26:37.361
They go through the day
too disgusted to eat.

26:37.363 --> 26:39.163
               They lose weight?

26:39.165 --> 26:41.098
Seriously,
that's all you heard

26:41.100 --> 26:42.666
 from what I just said?

26:42.668 --> 26:44.168
All right, I'm gonna
make you another latté.

26:44.170 --> 26:45.803
          Look, I--
      Oh, you know what?

26:45.805 --> 26:48.172
               You-that's mine.
            You've-that's mine.

26:48.174 --> 26:49.206
 Oh, sorry.

26:49.208 --> 26:52.209
Oh, no, wait a minute.
Good news.

26:52.211 --> 26:54.111
We ordered exactly
the same thing.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.346
Here, here's mine.
I didn't touch it.

26:55.348 --> 26:56.914
Take that, we're fixed.

26:56.916 --> 26:58.949
      No, it's not fixed
     because that's mine

26:58.951 --> 27:00.084
          and it's very special.

27:00.086 --> 27:01.619
 No, look, it's okay.

27:01.621 --> 27:04.021
I already put my fixings in
so you take that one

27:04.023 --> 27:05.689
and it's a win-win.

27:05.691 --> 27:09.259
   It's seriously not a win-win
              because it's mine

27:09.261 --> 27:10.694
       and I just really would--

27:10.696 --> 27:11.895
I know that we don't
know each other

27:11.897 --> 27:13.364
but I'm just gonna
say something here.

27:13.366 --> 27:16.200
I think I understand
what you're going through.

27:16.202 --> 27:18.702
You are afraid of change, right?

27:18.704 --> 27:20.004
             No.
      Of losing control,

27:20.006 --> 27:23.841
so you fixate on the idea
of ownership of objects.

27:23.843 --> 27:25.909
You know, I'm gonna
do you a favor, okay?

27:25.911 --> 27:29.246
I'm taking your latté
and I'm giving you freedom.

27:29.248 --> 27:32.016
You're gonna thank me,
you are.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.687
          Oh, mm-mm.

27:36.689 --> 27:38.756
I'm tasting your freedom.

27:38.758 --> 27:41.158
              So not my freedom

29:02.374 --> 29:04.074
Now, ladies,
I would like to ask

29:04.076 --> 29:06.844
how you feel about
the current epidemic

29:06.846 --> 29:10.481
of female self-mutilation
through plastic surgery.

29:10.483 --> 29:13.350
Oh, hon, count me among
the self-mutilators.

29:13.352 --> 29:15.352
         See my neck?
         I hated it.

29:15.354 --> 29:17.254
        Had more rings
     than an old redwood.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.089
         So I went in
    and had a nip tuck me

29:19.091 --> 29:20.524
       and now I love it.

29:20.526 --> 29:23.293
Well, Marcia,
you are an actress

29:23.295 --> 29:24.895
and obviously
you felt pressure

29:24.897 --> 29:27.331
 from the male-dominated media.

29:27.333 --> 29:30.067
      No, hated my neck
        so I fixed it.

29:30.069 --> 29:33.137
   As a transgender person,
   I've had some work done.

29:33.139 --> 29:34.972

                  a little more

29:39.845 --> 29:41.812
    what you mean when you say,

 I mean, it was so much fun."

01:07:14.564 --> 01:07:16.765
      But if we'd gone,
we would have just gotten hives

01:07:16.767 --> 01:07:18.633
     and would have gone
       to the hospital.

01:07:18.635 --> 01:07:22.170

   that's what this is?

           mutilation of women.

            a breast reduction.

01:07:31.114 --> 01:07:32.680
            What?
  'Cause they were too big.

01:07:32.682 --> 01:07:37.118
          I had to.
   I stuff my bra for work.

01:07:43.126 --> 01:07:45.326
         Yes, ma'am.
   And keep it to yourself.

01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:48.630
 We'll say nothing.

for Peter Durton.

01:08:07.551 --> 01:08:08.817
 Did you get the flowers?

01:08:08.819 --> 01:08:10.218
( LAUGHING )
Why, yes.

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:11.486
But I have no idea why.

01:08:11.488 --> 01:08:12.720
They're from Peter.

set up a drinks with you

at his private screening room

01:08:19.796 --> 01:08:22.497
to discuss a book deal
through his publishing arm.

I'm sorry,
do I know you?

01:08:24.468 --> 01:08:27.301
( LAUGHING )
Not me.

01:08:27.304 --> 01:08:30.638
Peter Durton, the editor
of Cheswick Fair Magazine.

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:31.840
He also does books.

01:08:31.841 --> 01:08:33.808
He rents a private
screening room

01:08:33.810 --> 01:08:35.676
to watch the nominated films.

01:08:35.679 --> 01:08:37.145
He has a suite
at the Peninsula

01:08:37.147 --> 01:08:38.813
but it always gets him
depressed.

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:42.283
So and he can't possibly
watch the movies

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:45.587
on a regular television,
oh, that's a nightmare.

01:08:45.589 --> 01:08:47.388
Anyway, can you do
Tuesday at 4?

01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:49.823
I'm sorry,
how does he even know me?

01:08:49.826 --> 01:08:52.660
From the Internet,
obviously.

01:08:52.662 --> 01:08:53.862
Congrats on that,
by the way.

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:55.729
 Hence the flowers.

01:08:55.732 --> 01:08:56.831
        Ah.

01:08:56.832 --> 01:08:58.399
Tuesday at 4.
We'll see you.

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:03.604
   I'm so glad you came by.
   Can you stay for dinner?

01:09:03.607 --> 01:09:08.910
            Maybe.
            Yeah.

01:09:08.912 --> 01:09:10.612
                     What a day.

01:09:10.613 --> 01:09:12.779
She was my mentor,
you know?

01:09:12.782 --> 01:09:14.515
I was counting on this.

01:09:16.286 --> 01:09:20.255
      Well, you've got alimony,
                  I'm guessing.

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:22.256
       No.

01:09:22.259 --> 01:09:24.658
We had a prenup
and I didn't fight it

01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:27.295
'cause I didn't really
want to get paid by somebody

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:29.497
to not have sex with them,
you know?

01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:31.933
                 That's ethical.

01:09:31.934 --> 01:09:34.368
      I admire that but clearly
            you need more wine.

01:09:34.371 --> 01:09:36.304
      Clearly.

01:09:36.305 --> 01:09:38.640
I dunno, maybe
this Peter Durton thing

01:09:38.642 --> 01:09:40.207
will turn out to be
something.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:45.580
Yeah.

 It's not a date, okay?

01:09:49.419 --> 01:09:51.653

it's drinks.

                 screening room

01:09:53.857 --> 01:09:56.925
             because he's bored
     of his luxury hotel suite.

01:09:56.927 --> 01:09:58.793
          It sounds like a date.

you are trying to be funny.

                    for dinner?

01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:39.901
 No. No, I can't.

call myself a feminist.

Look, I hate to harsh
your whole princess trip here

01:21:38.628 --> 01:21:40.227

the book contract

01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:42.129
 from Peter Durton.

01:21:42.131 --> 01:21:44.932
And, as your literary agent,
I have to tell you,

01:21:44.934 --> 01:21:48.269
which I hate to tell you
because it is so much money

01:21:48.271 --> 01:21:51.538
and I love money,
but it is the worst deal ever.

01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:52.539

01:21:52.541 --> 01:21:54.041
           What's wrong with it?

01:21:54.043 --> 01:21:56.310
It's indentured servitude
with better outfits.

01:21:56.312 --> 01:21:59.380

you have no creative rights.

01:21:59.382 --> 01:22:01.081

01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:02.917

exactly what to write.

01:22:02.919 --> 01:22:04.485
I mean, granted,
for a lot of money

01:22:04.487 --> 01:22:07.121
and, seriously,
better outfits.

01:22:07.123 --> 01:22:08.355

have the right to dress you.

01:22:08.357 --> 01:22:09.523
                    What?

01:22:09.525 --> 01:22:11.258
It's like
you're Author Barbie.

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:13.427
     All right, well, you know,
 we'll just negotiate with him.

01:22:13.429 --> 01:22:15.696

as long as you want

01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:22.569
and to write a book
that is actually good,

01:22:22.571 --> 01:22:24.571
which I believe
that I can sell.

01:22:24.573 --> 01:22:26.073

there's no guarantees but--

          living here for free.

my grocery shopping

01:28:42.584 --> 01:28:46.620
<i> before my bad lip job</i>
<i> went viral,</i>

01:28:46.622 --> 01:28:51.058
I asked you guys who do you
think is a feminist icon.

01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:56.663
And I've been
thinking about it,

01:28:56.665 --> 01:29:01.034
and I think that here
in Deborah's department,

01:29:01.036 --> 01:29:03.220
     no one is.

01:29:03.221 --> 01:29:05.405
<i> I can't be honest with</i>
<i> my students about anything,</i>

01:29:05.407 --> 01:29:07.407
<i> not even my own fat.</i>

01:29:07.409 --> 01:29:10.010
       So,

01:29:10.012 --> 01:29:12.713
I have actually
resigned my position.

01:29:12.715 --> 01:29:14.715
            What?
            Yeah.

01:29:14.717 --> 01:29:15.749
   I know.

01:29:16.952 --> 01:29:18.919
<i> I'm gonna write a book,</i>

01:29:18.921 --> 01:29:20.554
which I'm really
excited about

01:29:20.556 --> 01:29:22.656
 but I'm also really terrified.

01:29:24.693 --> 01:29:26.360
But the biggest thing is
that I'm just really

01:29:26.362 --> 01:29:28.695
 gonna miss all of you.

01:29:28.697 --> 01:29:33.767
   And so I decided to make
    presents for you guys.

01:29:33.769 --> 01:29:35.736
     I hope you like them.

01:29:35.738 --> 01:29:37.804
   This shirt fits everybody.

01:29:37.806 --> 01:29:41.441
It fits anybody that actually
 really cares about equality,

01:29:41.443 --> 01:29:43.377
     regardless of gender.

01:29:43.379 --> 01:29:46.646
  Because to me, that's what
    a feminist looks like.

01:29:46.648 --> 01:29:49.850
      And I just really
      want to thank you

01:29:49.852 --> 01:29:51.885
      for letting me be
        your teacher.

01:29:51.887 --> 01:29:52.919
         I've loved it.

            I do.

             I'm gonna miss you
                       so much.

01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:08.168
Oh, honey, oh, I know.
We're real friends.

01:30:08.170 --> 01:30:09.803
I'm gonna see you
all the time.

01:30:09.805 --> 01:30:10.871
                      Oh, don't.

01:30:10.873 --> 01:30:12.973
Oh, honey,
it's gonna be fine.

When I met Suzanne,

01:31:20.075 --> 01:31:21.541
 I thought one thing.

01:31:21.543 --> 01:31:23.477
I thought,
"There's a woman."

01:31:23.479 --> 01:31:25.579
And the second thing
I thought was,

01:31:25.581 --> 01:31:27.614
and I don't
like to use this word

01:31:27.616 --> 01:31:29.249
but in my profession
I have to,

01:31:29.251 --> 01:31:31.518
 "There's a fat woman."

01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:33.887
 And when she, God help me,

01:31:33.889 --> 01:31:35.088
 I hate to use this word too,

01:31:35.090 --> 01:31:38.525
when she waddled
into my room and she,

01:31:38.527 --> 01:31:40.227
 and I hate to use this word,

01:31:40.229 --> 01:31:43.029
"sat her fatness down,"

01:31:43.031 --> 01:31:44.598
I tried to look her
in the eye.

01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:45.966
But all I could do
was look her in the fat

01:31:45.968 --> 01:31:47.100
 and I thought,

01:31:47.102 --> 01:31:48.535
"If I don't help
this woman now,

01:31:48.537 --> 01:31:51.571
she'll be dead
within a week."
