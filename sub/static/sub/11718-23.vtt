Hey, Kono, what's up?

00:17.594 --> 00:18.895
KONA:
Hey.

(camera shutter clicking)

00:25.152 --> 00:26.736
(camera shutter clicking)

00:28.184 --> 00:29.518
You going straight in?

00:29.552 --> 00:31.019
Yeah.
All right.

00:31.054 --> 00:32.354
I may take
the scenic route.

00:32.387 --> 00:34.506
Okay.

01:22.155 --> 01:23.355
Fryer.

01:23.389 --> 01:26.224
Sir, we have a report
of a DOA in the alley behind

01:26.242 --> 01:28.944
2010 Halana Drive in Manoa.
Officers already on scene.

01:28.995 --> 01:31.613
10-4 on the last. Tell the CID
Lieutenant I'm responding,

01:31.664 --> 01:33.949
and have him roll
whichever team is up.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.617
I'll meet him there, okay?

01:35.668 --> 01:37.202
Yes, sir.
All right.

01:58.407 --> 01:59.941
Hey, this is Fryer.

01:59.976 --> 02:02.594
I'm at the reported DOA.

02:02.612 --> 02:04.196
Where the hell is patrol?

02:04.230 --> 02:06.064
Did you give me
the right address?

02:06.098 --> 02:07.765
It's 2010 Halana Drive.
There's nobody here.

02:07.784 --> 02:09.067
Where are all my units?

02:09.101 --> 02:11.453
Please hold while I check
the status of a DOA.

02:11.487 --> 02:14.772
Chief, I don't have any report
of a DOA.

03:55.591 --> 03:57.559
You should've told me
you were coming, Joe.

03:57.593 --> 04:00.061
I couldn't risk anyone knowing
I was on the island.

04:00.096 --> 04:01.713
I had to see for myself.

04:01.731 --> 04:03.148
See for yourself?

04:04.100 --> 04:05.150
How'd you know?

04:05.184 --> 04:07.152
When you bring down
an international

04:07.186 --> 04:09.020
arms dealer and murderer,
word gets around.

04:09.054 --> 04:10.488
Is that right?
That's right.

04:10.523 --> 04:12.741
And now that Wo Fat
is behind bars,

04:12.775 --> 04:15.393
we can discuss what's
been keeping you up at night.

04:15.411 --> 04:17.495
Oh, you mean the fact that you
lied to me about Shelburne?

04:17.529 --> 04:21.065
I know you're hurting, son,
but I did that to protect you.

04:21.083 --> 04:24.369
Joe, I'm done dancing
with you, okay?

04:24.403 --> 04:26.338
I'll find Shelburne on my own.

04:26.372 --> 04:28.906
Well, you won't
if you continue searching

04:28.925 --> 04:31.927
on the east coast
of Japan's Honshu.

04:33.963 --> 04:36.431
How did you know
I was in Japan?

04:36.465 --> 04:38.216
That's where you found Wo Fat,
wasn't it?

04:38.250 --> 04:39.351
You didn't answer the question,
Joe.

04:39.385 --> 04:40.936
Because I made damn sure

04:40.970 --> 04:42.103
"word didn't
get around" on that.

04:42.138 --> 04:43.688
I trained you, Steve.
I know how you operate.

04:43.723 --> 04:45.757
And it was just a matter of time
before you figured out

04:45.775 --> 04:47.759
that I lied, started looking
for Shelburne on your own.

04:47.777 --> 04:50.061
Only you were looking
in the wrong area.

04:50.095 --> 04:51.980
No, I wasn't looking
in the wrong area, Joe.

04:52.031 --> 04:53.765
I was just getting
there too late.

04:53.783 --> 04:56.067
Somebody was one step ahead
of me, moving Shelburne

04:56.101 --> 04:57.619
from safe house
to safe house.

04:57.653 --> 04:59.604
Somebody who knew me very well.

04:59.622 --> 05:01.206
Guilty as charged.

05:01.240 --> 05:03.575
But now that
Wo Fat's in jail,

05:03.609 --> 05:05.577
it's time for you
to meet Shelburne.

05:05.611 --> 05:07.545
Oh, yeah? Yeah, you're gonna
take me to Shelburne?

05:07.580 --> 05:09.947
That's why I'm here.

05:09.966 --> 05:11.967
(phone rings)

05:14.119 --> 05:15.286
McGarrett.

05:17.807 --> 05:20.475
Fryer? When?

05:22.178 --> 05:23.595
I'm on my way.

05:23.629 --> 05:25.096
We have to go.

05:25.731 --> 05:26.848
"We"?

05:26.899 --> 05:29.351
Yeah, "we," Joe. I'm not letting
you out of my sight

05:29.402 --> 05:30.602
until we finish
this conversation.

05:30.636 --> 05:32.787
Let's go.

05:32.822 --> 05:34.322
After you.

05:38.661 --> 05:41.813
STEVE: <i>Chin, what do you got?</i>
CHIN: <i>Not really sure.</i>

05:41.831 --> 05:42.931
Details are still
coming in.

05:42.965 --> 05:44.816
What I do know is that
Fryer called dispatch

05:44.834 --> 05:47.369
regarding a DOA
he was responding to.

05:47.420 --> 05:49.153
He was sent out here?

05:49.171 --> 05:50.422
Apparently so.

05:50.456 --> 05:52.507
When he got on scene,
he asked where patrol was.

05:52.541 --> 05:53.958
When a unit arrived
eight minutes later,

05:53.992 --> 05:54.976
they discovered
his body.

05:55.011 --> 05:55.944
All right, listen, Chin.

05:55.978 --> 05:57.679
I need you to coordinate
with HPD.

05:57.713 --> 05:59.881
Have them lock down the area,
round up bystanders, okay?

05:59.915 --> 06:01.216
Someone must've
seen something.

06:01.250 --> 06:02.417
Copy.

06:02.451 --> 06:04.886
Excuse me, ma'am.
What's going on?

06:04.937 --> 06:07.004
Sir, if you wouldn't mind
standing behind

06:07.023 --> 06:09.357
the police officers.
Thank you.

06:25.324 --> 06:26.708
The Chief was
a strong man.

06:26.742 --> 06:29.878
Took multiple GSWs to the chest to
bring him down.

06:29.912 --> 06:31.246
JOE:
Well, that's odd.

06:31.297 --> 06:32.163
What is it, Joe?

06:32.197 --> 06:34.632
Two of these wounds
have powder burns.

06:34.667 --> 06:36.033
Astute observation,
Commander.

06:36.052 --> 06:39.387
The powder burns indicate
close-proximity shots.

06:39.422 --> 06:41.056
And judging
by the size and shape

06:41.090 --> 06:42.090
of the entry wound,

06:42.124 --> 06:44.008
they're from
a small-caliber handgun.

06:44.042 --> 06:46.544
Yeah, but this third one
doesn't have any powder burns,

06:46.562 --> 06:49.764
and it looks like it was fired
from a distance.

06:49.815 --> 06:52.183
And by the way, Max,
you can call me Joe.

06:52.217 --> 06:53.601
I'm out of the service, son.

06:53.652 --> 06:55.320
Duly noted.

07:02.661 --> 07:03.945
All right...

07:03.996 --> 07:05.230
Fryer gets here.

07:05.264 --> 07:07.348
He finds this dummy lying
in the middle of the street.

07:07.383 --> 07:09.667
He takes one in the chest
from a distance,

07:09.702 --> 07:11.703
and the shooter comes down,
finishes him off at close range.

07:11.737 --> 07:13.588
Doesn't make sense.
A professional would've

07:13.622 --> 07:14.756
done it right the first time.

07:14.790 --> 07:16.124
Unless the shooter
wanted the kill shot

07:16.158 --> 07:17.459
to be up close
and personal.

07:17.510 --> 07:18.443
Vendetta?

07:29.305 --> 07:30.421
What do ya got?

07:30.439 --> 07:31.623
A .40 cal.

07:37.113 --> 07:39.514
He's got a round missing.

07:39.548 --> 07:41.299
Fryer got a shot off.

07:41.333 --> 07:42.266
Good for him.

07:42.284 --> 07:43.234
Joe's right.

07:43.268 --> 07:45.203
This wasn't
a random killing.

07:45.237 --> 07:46.704
This was personal.

07:54.130 --> 07:56.097
Hey, guys, over here!

07:56.132 --> 07:57.782
(gunshot)

07:57.800 --> 07:59.067
Max!

08:00.536 --> 08:01.786
Max!

08:05.324 --> 08:06.257
Joe!

08:06.291 --> 08:08.076
I got him.
I got him.

08:11.230 --> 08:12.847
We need an ambulance now!

08:12.898 --> 08:13.848
Danny!

08:15.317 --> 08:16.734
(tires squeal)

08:25.821 --> 08:27.489
(sirens blaring)

08:33.562 --> 08:35.580
Detective Danny Williams,
Five-O.

08:35.631 --> 08:38.032
I'm in pursuit of a Code 10,
white HPD vehicle

08:38.049 --> 08:41.352
with the plates 221.
Repeat: 2-2-1.

08:41.386 --> 08:44.306
Headed north on the Pali
coming from School Street.

09:02.224 --> 09:04.058
Relax, Max.
It's only a scratch.

09:04.076 --> 09:06.678
You're gonna be fine.

09:18.908 --> 09:20.709
Why would somebody shoot Fryer
and then wait

09:20.743 --> 09:22.344
for other cops
to show up?

09:22.378 --> 09:23.431
I don't know. Maybe he
was looking to check out.

09:23.456 --> 09:24.929
Maybe he's a complete idiot.

09:24.930 --> 09:26.965
I have no idea.
The bigger question is

09:27.016 --> 09:28.900
why is he heading
straight for the HPD?

09:28.934 --> 09:29.951
Seriously?

09:51.824 --> 09:54.559
DANNY: Oh, perfect.
Pretty sure it's the white one.

10:07.073 --> 10:09.841
CHIN:
Stairwell!

10:13.646 --> 10:15.129
STEVE:
On me!

10:25.808 --> 10:26.974
Where's Lukela?

10:26.992 --> 10:30.728
Hey, Danny, check
the security feed. Everybody!

10:30.763 --> 10:32.297
Hey, Steve,
what's going on?

10:32.331 --> 10:34.282
Everybody, listen up!

10:34.316 --> 10:36.167
We lost Chief Fryer.

10:36.202 --> 10:38.753
His killer is somewhere
in the building.

10:38.788 --> 10:39.654
The suspect is armed.

10:39.672 --> 10:41.923
I want this place locked down
right now.

10:41.957 --> 10:42.824
Nobody comes or goes.

10:42.875 --> 10:44.175
Lukela, verify your people
and get 'em

10:44.210 --> 10:45.326
moving right now.
Hey, Steve, I got him!

10:45.361 --> 10:47.212
You heard him.
Move, move, move!

10:47.263 --> 10:48.830
Basement, Steve, basement.

10:48.848 --> 10:50.164
The shooter's
in the basement!

10:50.182 --> 10:52.016
Guys, move it!

10:54.553 --> 10:57.839
Everybody out now.
Clear the basement right now.

10:57.857 --> 10:59.524
Clear! Clear!

10:59.558 --> 11:01.509
Clear! Get out of here!

11:01.527 --> 11:04.512
Go, go.

11:04.547 --> 11:05.513
You okay?

11:05.531 --> 11:06.514
Yeah.

11:06.532 --> 11:07.782
Some guy just bull-rushed me.

11:07.817 --> 11:09.484
Did you see him?
You see what he looked like?

11:09.518 --> 11:10.485
Yeah, like, 5'10", slim.

11:10.519 --> 11:11.703
He was wearing a black hoodie.

11:11.737 --> 11:13.154
Okay.

11:13.188 --> 11:14.873
Which way did he go?
Where'd he go?

11:14.907 --> 11:15.990
He was headed for the archives.

11:16.024 --> 11:17.659
Okay. Okay, get out of here.

11:17.693 --> 11:19.861
Yeah.
Go!

11:21.997 --> 11:23.030
(siren wailing)

11:23.048 --> 11:25.166
(monitor beeping steadily)

11:30.389 --> 11:31.890
Sir, he's trying
to say something.

11:31.924 --> 11:34.425
Hey, buddy.

11:34.477 --> 11:35.710
Am I gonna die?

11:35.728 --> 11:37.812
No, you are not
gonna die today, Max.

11:37.847 --> 11:38.847
McGarrett's gonna

11:38.881 --> 11:40.665
find the man
who did this to you.

11:42.568 --> 11:43.685
Joe...

11:43.719 --> 11:45.019
What? What? Hold on.

11:45.053 --> 11:46.821
What is it?

11:48.891 --> 11:50.241
(whispers)

11:51.610 --> 11:52.827
Are you sure?

11:56.248 --> 11:57.231
Hey.

11:57.249 --> 11:58.283
Anything?

11:58.334 --> 11:59.501
This guy's disappeared.

12:00.402 --> 12:01.536
No sign of him.

12:01.570 --> 12:02.787
He's still here.

12:02.838 --> 12:04.873
He's hiding someplace,
but he's still here.

12:04.907 --> 12:05.924
What, in a
police precinct?

12:05.958 --> 12:07.175
We catch this idiot,

12:07.209 --> 12:09.043
I want to put him on
<i>America's Dumbest Criminals.</i>

12:09.077 --> 12:10.578
You know, he could be a cop.

12:11.614 --> 12:12.514
Yeah, that would explain

12:12.548 --> 12:14.132
how he knows where he's going.

12:14.183 --> 12:15.383
(cell phone ringing)

12:15.417 --> 12:17.185
It's Joe.

12:17.219 --> 12:18.469
Joe, how's Max?

12:18.521 --> 12:20.471
JOE:
Yeah, he's stable for now.

12:20.523 --> 12:22.440
Listen, Max told me something
that you need to know.

12:22.474 --> 12:24.642
The person who shot him
is a woman.

12:24.693 --> 12:27.111
I repeat: a woman.

12:27.146 --> 12:29.147
Brown hair, early 30s.

12:29.198 --> 12:30.315
What?

12:30.366 --> 12:32.066
What?
I saw her.

12:40.292 --> 12:42.276
She was right here.
I saw her.

12:42.294 --> 12:43.962
Long brown hair,
early 30s.

12:43.996 --> 12:45.713
I thought
she was a civilian.

12:49.952 --> 12:50.802
Hey, boss!

12:50.836 --> 12:53.120
This look familiar?

12:53.138 --> 12:55.807
This is the hoodie
our shooter was wearing.

13:09.655 --> 13:12.907
(quiet hissing)

13:18.313 --> 13:19.614
CHIN:
Room clear.

13:19.648 --> 13:21.866
Hey.

13:21.917 --> 13:23.284
You smell that?

13:27.823 --> 13:30.792
(hissing)

13:32.327 --> 13:33.878
Out.

13:33.929 --> 13:35.546
Out! Out now!

13:35.598 --> 13:37.015
Get everybody out of here now!

13:37.049 --> 13:38.483
(alarm ringing)

13:38.517 --> 13:39.651
Go! Go! Go!

13:54.350 --> 13:57.018
(car alarms blaring)

13:57.036 --> 13:59.537
(people clamoring, screaming)

14:06.266 --> 14:08.300
(sirens wailing)

14:17.543 --> 14:19.511
STEVE: No, a little more hair,
little more hair.

14:19.545 --> 14:20.980
That's good. Shoulder
length, brown.

14:21.014 --> 14:22.097
Yeah, like that.

14:22.148 --> 14:22.982
Get that to Lukela,
all right?

14:23.016 --> 14:24.216
DANNY: Yo.
Hey.

14:24.234 --> 14:26.135
What do we got on Chin?

14:26.169 --> 14:28.671
Got a good bump on his head;
he broke a couple ribs.

14:28.705 --> 14:29.822
He's on his way
to Tripler though.

14:29.856 --> 14:30.890
Army hospital's
got better experience

14:30.924 --> 14:31.907
with blast trauma injuries.

14:31.942 --> 14:33.659
What about the shooter?

14:33.693 --> 14:35.227
Nothing so far.
The rescue team's still looking.

14:35.245 --> 14:37.229
Hopefully, she's
trapped in there,

14:37.247 --> 14:38.747
preferably in a lot of pain.

14:38.782 --> 14:40.115
No way, Danny.
She made it out.

14:40.150 --> 14:41.750
She knew exactly
what she was doing.

14:41.785 --> 14:43.285
I me, this explosion
was a diversion.

14:43.320 --> 14:45.237
You got Fryer.
Now you got this.

14:45.255 --> 14:48.223
This girl definitely has a
grudge against police officers.

14:55.849 --> 14:58.300
No, Adam, I'm all right, really.

14:58.351 --> 15:01.186
I'm just at the hospital now
looking for my cousin.

15:01.221 --> 15:03.439
I'll call you back
when I know more, okay?

15:03.473 --> 15:05.107
Okay, bye.

15:12.482 --> 15:14.950
Okay? I don't need an X-ray.
I'm all right.

15:14.985 --> 15:17.536
Not only are you getting
an X-ray, I want a CT scan

15:17.570 --> 15:18.520
as well.

15:18.555 --> 15:20.205
Now, what are you
doing down here?

15:20.240 --> 15:21.540
Head of E.R. called me.

15:21.574 --> 15:22.791
I'm credentialed to work here

15:22.826 --> 15:25.110
in case of emergencies,
so I came to help out.

15:25.128 --> 15:27.463
Look, baby, I am fine.

15:27.497 --> 15:28.714
I need to get back out there.

15:28.748 --> 15:30.749
Not until you're cleared
by a doctor,

15:30.783 --> 15:32.718
and that would be me, your wife.
There are a lot

15:32.752 --> 15:34.453
of other cops out there
in worse condition than I am.

15:34.471 --> 15:36.138
I know.

15:37.957 --> 15:39.758
I'm just glad you're okay.

15:41.627 --> 15:43.312
How many wounded
are there?

15:43.346 --> 15:45.230
20 so far.

15:45.265 --> 15:46.682
But no fatalities, thank God.

15:46.733 --> 15:47.933
What about Max?

15:47.967 --> 15:49.468
You hear anything
about his condition?

15:49.486 --> 15:50.903
He just went into surgery.

15:50.937 --> 15:52.488
He lost a lot of blood.

15:53.306 --> 15:55.491
Hey, cuz, you okay?

15:55.525 --> 15:58.093
Stubborn as ever
and ready to go back to work.

15:59.829 --> 16:01.646
Sorry, I should go.

16:01.665 --> 16:03.782
Yes, please.

16:03.817 --> 16:05.284
I'll see you at home.

16:08.405 --> 16:09.371
(sighs)

16:09.406 --> 16:10.706
What's the latest?

16:10.740 --> 16:14.043
Well, I just spoke to a desk
sergeant who said that Fryer

16:14.094 --> 16:16.128
was responding to a DOA call
when he was shot.

16:16.162 --> 16:17.496
The thing is,
there's no record

16:17.514 --> 16:20.265
of any such call
going through dispatch.

16:20.300 --> 16:21.600
Okay, well, that means
the killer

16:21.634 --> 16:22.601
reached out to him directly.

16:22.635 --> 16:23.668
Did you check
his phone logs?

16:23.687 --> 16:25.304
Yeah, the call came
from a burner phone,

16:25.338 --> 16:26.522
so no luck there.

16:26.556 --> 16:30.109
Who the hell is this person?

16:32.362 --> 16:35.013
STEVE: <i>All right, this woman</i>
<i>knew enough</i>

16:35.031 --> 16:37.449
about police procedure
to fake a dispatch call.

16:37.484 --> 16:38.817
Does not necessarily mean
she's a cop.

16:38.851 --> 16:40.703
And she knew her way
around HPD

16:40.737 --> 16:42.154
well enough to elude capture,

16:42.188 --> 16:43.739
blow the place up
and then vanish.

16:43.823 --> 16:44.823
Could be military training,

16:44.857 --> 16:46.158
it could be
law enforcement training.

16:46.192 --> 16:47.543
We don't know.
All right.

16:47.577 --> 16:48.827
Chin is going through
Fryer's old cases

16:48.861 --> 16:49.861
plus his IA investigations.

16:49.879 --> 16:51.964
(cell phone ringing)
If she is an ex-cop,

16:51.998 --> 16:53.882
she's gonna be in the system.
Danny, I don't want

16:53.917 --> 16:54.967
to believe this any more
than you do.

16:55.001 --> 16:56.752
Uh, this is
a private phone call

16:56.803 --> 16:58.220
that I have to take.

17:00.090 --> 17:02.040
You want me to cover my ears
and drive with my knees?

17:02.058 --> 17:04.041
I can, you know, I can put
my head out the window

17:04.060 --> 17:06.145
if you want, drive with my feet.
I got great toe control.

17:06.179 --> 17:07.512
(phone ringing)

17:07.547 --> 17:09.231
This is costing me money...
Take the call.

17:09.265 --> 17:11.683
Thank you. Thank you.

17:11.717 --> 17:13.435
Hello.

17:13.486 --> 17:15.738
Yeah, uh,
thank you for calling me back.

17:15.771 --> 17:18.656
Uh, did you have a chance
to look at the thing?

17:22.494 --> 17:26.231
Okay. Is there any way
I can stop it?

17:26.266 --> 17:28.117
I mean,
anything I can do?

17:28.167 --> 17:29.868
Okay, uh...

17:29.902 --> 17:31.587
Let me, uh,
let me call you back

17:31.621 --> 17:33.422
because I have to
seriously think about that.

17:33.456 --> 17:34.506
Okay?

17:34.574 --> 17:37.176
Thank you. Bye.

17:37.210 --> 17:39.294
(clears throat)

17:42.748 --> 17:44.266
So?

17:44.300 --> 17:46.418
So what?

17:46.436 --> 17:47.436
You gonna tell me

17:47.470 --> 17:48.753
what that was about?

17:48.772 --> 17:51.473
I already told you,
it was, uh, it was private.

17:51.524 --> 17:53.425
All right with
the Navy SEAL death stare.

17:53.443 --> 17:55.093
What, are you gonna do?
You gonna waterboard me

17:55.111 --> 17:57.251
until I tell you
about my private phone call?

17:57.252 --> 17:59.399
No, I'm just trying to get you
to tell me 'cause we're friends

17:59.732 --> 18:01.483
and I'm, I'm concerned.

18:01.534 --> 18:03.368
You mean you want me to share?
- Yes. - Share like you do?

18:03.403 --> 18:04.620
Okay, I can do that.
Here's what I'm gonna do:

18:04.654 --> 18:05.621
I'm gonna write you a letter,

18:05.655 --> 18:06.789
I'm gonna explain nothing,
and then

18:06.823 --> 18:07.906
I'm gonna just take off

18:07.940 --> 18:09.741
for a couple of weeks. Okay?
First of all,

18:09.775 --> 18:10.793
I had to do that
on my own, okay?

18:10.827 --> 18:12.494
You know that I had to do that.
Hold on.

18:12.545 --> 18:14.546
What?
There is no "my own" in a friendship.

18:14.581 --> 18:15.914
There is no "my own."

18:15.948 --> 18:17.382
Your problems
become my problems.

18:17.417 --> 18:19.501
So what's the problem?

18:19.552 --> 18:22.287
The problem...

18:22.305 --> 18:25.257
is that Stan
just got a project in Las Vegas

18:25.308 --> 18:26.809
and they want
to move, okay?

18:26.843 --> 18:28.927
And Rachel wants
to take Grace off the island.

18:28.961 --> 18:32.464
What? Are you supposed
to follow Stan and his projects

18:32.482 --> 18:33.932
wherever he goes?
No.

18:33.966 --> 18:35.434
I'm not going anywhere, okay?
Good.

18:35.468 --> 18:36.435
That was a lawyer.

18:36.469 --> 18:38.187
And I am trying to figure out

18:38.238 --> 18:40.939
how I'm going to fight
this thing.

18:40.974 --> 18:42.307
What are your chances?

18:42.325 --> 18:43.575
I got a good case,

18:43.610 --> 18:45.310
but I, you know,
it's gonna get ugly.

18:45.328 --> 18:47.279
I've got to drag Rachel
through the mud.

18:47.313 --> 18:49.781
And I'm not sure
that I want to do that.

18:57.423 --> 18:58.657
DANNY:
<i>Hey, tell me</i>

18:58.675 --> 19:01.376
something came up with
the door-to-door search?

19:01.427 --> 19:02.628
Nothing so far.

19:02.662 --> 19:04.296
It's like our shooter's a ghost.
We get anything

19:04.330 --> 19:05.848
from the surveillance system
in HPD?

19:05.882 --> 19:08.217
Yeah, we're piecing it
together right now.

19:08.268 --> 19:11.003
This is from a camera
right outside the utility room.

19:11.037 --> 19:12.354
Time stamp places it minutes

19:12.388 --> 19:14.139
before the explosion.

19:14.174 --> 19:15.941
Who is she?

19:19.012 --> 19:20.195
There you are.

19:26.536 --> 19:28.620
CHIN:
We got a match.

19:29.706 --> 19:31.173
All right, our shooter's
name is Hillary Chaver.

19:31.207 --> 19:32.875
She's got priors:

19:32.909 --> 19:34.192
armed robbery, assault.

19:34.210 --> 19:35.644
Can I see that?

19:36.913 --> 19:39.631
What about an address?
Yeah, the uh,

19:39.666 --> 19:40.582
county cemetery.

19:40.633 --> 19:42.584
KONO: What?
Yeah,

19:42.635 --> 19:45.370
She was killed evading
the police five years ago.

20:00.982 --> 20:03.483
(sirens approaching)

20:05.653 --> 20:08.322
(labored breathing)

20:16.264 --> 20:18.382
(dogs barking)

20:22.554 --> 20:24.243
What the hell?

20:24.343 --> 20:26.294
Who else is here?
Just Shelly,

20:26.561 --> 20:27.678
my receptionist.

20:27.729 --> 20:30.648
Get over there.
Stay here. You understand?

20:30.682 --> 20:31.982
Are you Shelly?

20:32.017 --> 20:33.784
WOMAN:
Yes.

20:33.819 --> 20:36.937
(gunshot)

20:36.971 --> 20:38.823
Scrub up.

20:38.857 --> 20:41.108
Scrub up.
You've got some work to do.

20:45.530 --> 20:48.132
I said scrub up!
Now!

20:55.207 --> 20:58.025
Where the hell are you?
Call me when you get this.

20:59.094 --> 21:00.711
Doesn't make any sense.

21:00.762 --> 21:01.995
Well, her file says

21:02.013 --> 21:03.631
she and her partner,
Rick Brantley, were killed

21:03.665 --> 21:06.550
in a high-speed pursuit
following a bank robbery.

21:06.601 --> 21:08.652
DANNY: We got two armed assault
charges,

21:08.687 --> 21:10.855
knocked off a couple
liquor stores. What else?

21:10.889 --> 21:12.473
Then a string
of eight bank robberies

21:12.507 --> 21:13.607
culminating in the botched

21:13.642 --> 21:14.775
Oahu Savings & Loan job,

21:14.810 --> 21:16.343
which resulted
in a high-speed chase

21:16.361 --> 21:18.011
and subsequent death
of both suspects.

21:18.029 --> 21:19.730
DANNY:
All right, so...

21:19.781 --> 21:21.682
we are either dealing
with a reincarnation

21:21.700 --> 21:23.567
or an angry, vengeful ghost?

21:23.618 --> 21:25.319
Was there an autopsy report?

21:25.353 --> 21:27.288
No. They were both waived due
to the condition of the bodies.

21:27.322 --> 21:28.489
All they got
was a dental match

21:28.523 --> 21:29.907
on Brantley.
Okay, well,

21:29.958 --> 21:32.209
obviously, Chaver's body
wasn't in that car.

21:32.244 --> 21:33.661
KONO:
Okay, guess who

21:33.695 --> 21:35.129
the lead investigators were.

21:35.163 --> 21:38.516
Fryer and our favorite
dirty cop, Frank Delano.

21:38.550 --> 21:40.000
DANNY: Fantastic.
All right.

21:40.035 --> 21:41.469
Why don't we go
chat with Delano.

21:41.503 --> 21:44.255
Maybe he can shed some light
on how a dead girl

21:44.306 --> 21:46.757
managed to kill Fryer,
shoot Max,

21:46.808 --> 21:47.875
and blow up

21:47.893 --> 21:49.209
the Honolulu Police Department.

21:57.352 --> 21:59.052
What can I do
for you fine gentlemen

21:59.070 --> 22:00.053
of law enforcement?

22:00.071 --> 22:01.322
This face
ring a bell?

22:05.243 --> 22:07.027
Hilary Chaver.
Mm-hmm.

22:07.061 --> 22:08.445
STEVE:
Yeah, she lured Fryer out,

22:08.497 --> 22:09.697
and then shot him.

22:11.416 --> 22:12.416
That's impossible.

22:12.450 --> 22:13.667
STEVE:
That's what we thought, right?

22:13.702 --> 22:15.402
So why don't you tell us
what happened to her?

22:15.420 --> 22:16.737
(chuckles)

22:16.755 --> 22:19.239
It's in the file, man.

22:19.257 --> 22:21.876
Her and her partner went
on a bank robbing spree.

22:21.910 --> 22:23.210
Fryer and I led the task force.

22:23.244 --> 22:25.212
DANNY: How'd you catch up
to them?

22:25.246 --> 22:28.749
Well, they were one step
ahead of us for weeks.

22:28.767 --> 22:30.184
They messed up.
We got an in-progress.

22:30.218 --> 22:32.887
When Fryer and I showed up,
they were exiting the bank.

22:32.921 --> 22:34.471
Boom, we exchanged fire.

22:34.523 --> 22:35.923
All right,
in the file,

22:35.941 --> 22:37.591
it says there was a chase.

22:37.609 --> 22:40.394
Yeah, but not until Fryer
hit Brantley.

22:40.428 --> 22:42.196
Vince was a...

22:42.230 --> 22:45.816
he was a piece of work,
but a damn good shot.

22:45.867 --> 22:47.201
Okay, uh, then what happened?

22:47.235 --> 22:49.653
Uh, Chaver managed
to get Brantley in the car.

22:49.704 --> 22:51.238
We chased them
up Tantalus Drive.

22:51.272 --> 22:53.123
She took that last turn
a little too hot.

22:53.158 --> 22:55.275
Boom, car went over.

22:55.293 --> 22:56.794
Burst into flames.

22:56.828 --> 22:58.712
Okay.
You saw the car go over?

22:58.747 --> 23:00.381
Sure did.

23:00.415 --> 23:02.299
Was there when the techs
bagged the barbecue.

23:03.952 --> 23:05.252
Wasn't much of them left.

23:06.287 --> 23:07.621
DANNY: Okay, let's say
Chaver's alive.

23:07.639 --> 23:09.623
Okay?
Who else could it have been

23:09.641 --> 23:11.175
in that wreck if not her?

23:11.209 --> 23:12.509
(laughs)

23:12.561 --> 23:14.845
Uh... somebody who crossed them,

23:14.896 --> 23:16.814
a lookout, an accomplice
we didn't know about.

23:16.848 --> 23:18.899
I... I don't know.

23:18.934 --> 23:20.734
That doesn't
make any sense.

23:20.769 --> 23:22.302
Okay, um, who would she go to?

23:22.320 --> 23:24.738
I mean, place she'd go hole up,
somebody she'd go see.

23:24.773 --> 23:26.357
I thought she was dead.

23:26.408 --> 23:28.475
How am I supposed
to know where she is?

23:30.662 --> 23:32.029
Come on. You're the supercops.

23:32.080 --> 23:33.197
Find out what she wants,

23:33.248 --> 23:35.366
you'll find out where she is.

23:35.417 --> 23:37.418
What do you think she wants?
She wants revenge.

23:37.452 --> 23:38.752
She already
killed Fryer.

23:38.787 --> 23:40.170
So, what,
you think she's, uh...

23:40.205 --> 23:41.672
she's coming for me next?

23:41.706 --> 23:42.873
I-I don't know.

23:42.924 --> 23:44.491
Uh, maybe.

23:44.509 --> 23:46.443
Luckily, you're in here, though.

23:47.379 --> 23:48.829
(laughs)

23:48.847 --> 23:51.198
That's one way of looking at it.

23:51.232 --> 23:52.683
Look, uh...

23:52.717 --> 23:54.184
anything else
I can help you with

23:54.219 --> 23:56.103
or, uh, we about done here?

23:56.137 --> 23:57.888
We're done.
(knocks)

23:57.939 --> 23:59.773
Hey.

24:01.026 --> 24:02.776
Do me a favor.

24:02.811 --> 24:05.813
You make sure
you tell Kono I said hello.

24:25.867 --> 24:27.351
Welcome back, Max.

24:31.539 --> 24:33.974
Oh. You looking
for these?

24:35.176 --> 24:36.727
Oh. Ah.

24:36.761 --> 24:39.113
Thank you, Joe.

24:39.898 --> 24:41.181
I-I don't know
how to express

24:41.215 --> 24:42.516
my gratitude for
all your actions.

24:42.550 --> 24:43.734
That's not necessary.

24:43.768 --> 24:44.985
You just get better.

24:45.020 --> 24:46.370
(door opens)

24:48.973 --> 24:50.774
Whoa, bruddah.

24:51.726 --> 24:53.077
You all right?

24:53.111 --> 24:54.862
We got tofu shrimp

24:54.896 --> 24:56.830
for the fallen hero.

24:56.865 --> 24:58.949
Thank you, Kamekona,
but I'm no hero.

24:58.983 --> 25:00.233
Here, I got it.

25:00.251 --> 25:01.919
Brah, you took a bullet
in the line of duty.

25:01.953 --> 25:03.954
McGarrett owes
you a medal.

25:04.005 --> 25:06.573
At least workmen's comp.

25:06.591 --> 25:07.741
JOE: Hey, you don't
have a plate

25:07.759 --> 25:08.742
of those spicy shrimp

25:08.760 --> 25:10.044
in that bag,
do you?

25:10.078 --> 25:12.212
Course I do.

25:13.965 --> 25:16.016
So, did they catch her yet?

25:16.051 --> 25:17.301
Negative.

25:17.352 --> 25:19.753
They got some leads,
but so far she's evaded capture.

25:19.771 --> 25:21.305
What I can't figure out
is how you knew

25:21.356 --> 25:22.856
she was still
at the scene of the crime.

25:22.891 --> 25:25.943
Oh, I noticed these circular
gravitational blood drops

25:25.977 --> 25:27.394
next to Chief Fryer's body.

25:27.429 --> 25:29.313
I concluded
that the shooter

25:29.364 --> 25:31.732
was standing over Chief Fryer,

25:31.766 --> 25:33.600
bleeding--
so I estimated

25:33.618 --> 25:35.602
the trajectory
of the blood trail

25:35.620 --> 25:37.788
and was following it when I was...
Wait a minute.

25:37.822 --> 25:40.107
You saying the suspect
was wounded?

25:40.125 --> 25:41.375
MAX:
I believe so.

25:41.409 --> 25:43.276
And given that Chief Fryer used

25:43.294 --> 25:44.628
hollow-point
ammunition,

25:44.662 --> 25:46.914
I'd say she suffered
significant blood loss.

25:48.750 --> 25:50.634
KONO:
<i>You think Danny's</i>

25:50.668 --> 25:52.336
really gonna move to Vegas?

25:52.370 --> 25:54.071
Well, if that's where Rachel
and Grace are moving...

25:54.105 --> 25:55.839
he didn't have much
of a choice, huh?

25:55.890 --> 25:58.425
No. What a mess.
It sucks.

25:58.459 --> 26:00.310
(phone rings)

26:02.013 --> 26:04.231
Hey.
Delano give you anything?

26:04.265 --> 26:05.649
Besides attitude, no.
No, but listen,

26:05.683 --> 26:07.300
Joe just called.
Max is awake.

26:07.318 --> 26:09.019
Well, that's great!

26:09.070 --> 26:10.154
STEVE: He said that Fryer
managed to wound

26:10.188 --> 26:11.471
the shooter before
he was killed.

26:11.489 --> 26:12.573
We need to do a grid search

26:12.607 --> 26:14.274
of all medical care facilities

26:14.308 --> 26:15.776
within a ten-block radius
of HPD.

26:15.810 --> 26:18.078
Copy that.

26:18.113 --> 26:21.281
Okay. I have two
urgent care facilities,

26:21.315 --> 26:22.649
one free clinic,
and a couple of pharmacies.

26:22.667 --> 26:25.419
No, that's too risky for her to
walk into one of those places.

26:25.453 --> 26:27.788
I mean, she's gotta know
that a doctor's required

26:27.822 --> 26:29.673
to report a gunshot wound.
She's slicker than that.

26:29.707 --> 26:30.924
Here's another option.

26:30.959 --> 26:33.527
We got a veterinary clinic
six blocks away from HPD.

26:33.561 --> 26:35.763
It's on the corner
of Kapiolani and Alima.

26:35.797 --> 26:37.330
That's gotta be it. That's it.

26:37.348 --> 26:39.499
Tell HPD we're on our way
right now.

26:43.888 --> 26:45.856
There.

26:45.890 --> 26:47.107
That should hold.

26:47.142 --> 26:49.293
It better.

26:51.479 --> 26:54.481
Look, I've done
everything you've asked.

26:54.515 --> 26:55.682
All I want is to see
my wife and kids again.

26:55.700 --> 26:57.734
Yeah?

26:57.786 --> 26:59.686
What are you gonna
tell the cops?

26:59.704 --> 27:01.405
I won't say a word, I-I swear...

27:02.207 --> 27:04.024
If the police come to me,

27:04.042 --> 27:06.126
I'll say you wore a mask...

27:07.745 --> 27:09.997
All right.

27:10.031 --> 27:12.132
I'm gonna need some meds
before I get out of here.

27:12.167 --> 27:13.350
Something for the pain.

27:13.384 --> 27:15.502
Of course.

27:18.256 --> 27:20.357
(dogs yelping, barking)

27:26.848 --> 27:27.881
MAN:
Yeah?

27:27.899 --> 27:29.149
Where the hell have you been?

27:29.184 --> 27:30.267
I've been trying
to call you all day.

27:30.318 --> 27:31.318
MAN:
Just calm down.

27:31.352 --> 27:32.786
Tell me what happened.

27:34.439 --> 27:36.773
I got hit.
I need you to come get me.

27:36.825 --> 27:38.192
That wasn't part of the deal.

27:38.226 --> 27:39.493
Don't give me that.

27:39.527 --> 27:40.861
I took out Fryer,
just like we agreed...

27:40.895 --> 27:42.312
MAN:
...and just like we agreed,

27:42.347 --> 27:44.865
you got your revenge, along with
the cash from your last job.

27:44.899 --> 27:48.919
But this whole
getting shot thing...

27:48.953 --> 27:50.254
that sounds like
a "you" problem.

27:50.288 --> 27:51.788
No, it's an "us" problem!

27:51.840 --> 27:52.956
Now get here,
before I make a...

27:53.007 --> 27:54.124
MAN:
If I were you, honey,

27:54.175 --> 27:56.593
I'd quit harping
and look out your window.

27:56.628 --> 27:58.295
What?

28:00.598 --> 28:02.716
(phone ringing)

28:11.092 --> 28:13.243
Supposed to be open.
We called. Nobody answered.

28:13.278 --> 28:15.195
She could have hostages.

28:15.230 --> 28:16.880
We're about to find out.

28:16.915 --> 28:18.765
Let's move.

28:50.398 --> 28:51.965
STEVE:
All right, guys, listen up.

28:51.983 --> 28:54.134
Chin, you and I,
we're gonna stack the door.

28:54.152 --> 28:55.635
Danny, we're gonna need
cover fire, okay?

28:55.653 --> 28:57.137
Whoa!

29:00.992 --> 29:01.909
Chin, on me!

29:01.976 --> 29:03.143
Danny, move it!
Go!

29:03.161 --> 29:04.211
Go.

29:17.125 --> 29:19.209
Danny, move!

29:19.811 --> 29:22.462
STEVE:
Move!

29:26.050 --> 29:27.551
Chin, move!

29:33.191 --> 29:34.174
We got her.

29:34.192 --> 29:36.226
Locked.
Blow it.

29:40.498 --> 29:42.432
(dogs barking frantically)

29:44.285 --> 29:45.769
Got a civilian down.

29:48.773 --> 29:50.107
She's dead.

29:50.141 --> 29:51.158
Chin.

29:51.192 --> 29:53.193
You got point. You ready?

29:53.211 --> 29:54.911
Yeah.

30:04.872 --> 30:06.340
(barking)

30:07.041 --> 30:08.175
Chin!

30:10.478 --> 30:11.712
CHIN:
Steve!

30:14.365 --> 30:15.716
Is he all right?

30:16.550 --> 30:17.768
It didn't go through.

30:17.819 --> 30:19.136
Okay...
You okay, Steve?

30:19.170 --> 30:20.220
STEVE:
Yeah.

30:20.238 --> 30:22.022
Body armor works.

30:24.726 --> 30:26.943
What is that look?

30:26.995 --> 30:28.528
Please don't do anything stupid.
Please?

30:28.562 --> 30:30.831
Nobody likes to get shot.

30:30.865 --> 30:32.499
Please don't do anything...

30:36.737 --> 30:38.171
(grunts)

30:50.084 --> 30:53.253
Is there something
the matter with you?

30:53.271 --> 30:54.821
Huh?

30:55.723 --> 30:57.858
That was for Fryer.

31:23.234 --> 31:24.918
Hey.

31:24.952 --> 31:26.303
I was just on my way
to the hospital to visit Max.

31:26.337 --> 31:27.304
How's he doing?

31:27.338 --> 31:30.090
Max is very deceptive.

31:30.124 --> 31:31.925
Deceptive?

31:31.959 --> 31:33.260
Yeah.

31:33.294 --> 31:35.795
Under the guise of that
mild-mannered medical examiner

31:35.813 --> 31:37.314
beats the heart
of a real fighter.

31:37.348 --> 31:38.565
(chuckles)

31:38.599 --> 31:39.766
Well, that's good to hear.

31:39.800 --> 31:42.569
Poor guy's been through a lot.

31:42.603 --> 31:43.820
Yes, he has.

31:43.855 --> 31:45.805
So have you.

31:47.658 --> 31:50.193
You know, Joe, I gotta say
I really thought

31:50.244 --> 31:53.163
you'd just disappear again
without saying good-bye.

31:53.197 --> 31:54.948
I can't say
it didn't cross my mind.

31:54.982 --> 31:56.366
But?

31:56.417 --> 32:00.954
But someone that I admire
and respect very much

32:00.988 --> 32:03.290
sent me here to do a job,
so I'm doing it.

32:03.324 --> 32:05.592
Shelburne.

32:05.626 --> 32:07.511
I got my bags all packed.
I'm ready to go.

32:07.545 --> 32:09.346
All you have to do is come with.

32:09.380 --> 32:10.663
That's all, huh?

32:18.389 --> 32:20.273
Who are you calling?

32:20.308 --> 32:22.675
Danny. If I leave
another note for him

32:22.693 --> 32:24.511
saying that I'm going to Japan,
he'll never talk to me again.

32:24.529 --> 32:26.363
Mmm.

32:26.397 --> 32:28.348
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

32:31.185 --> 32:33.370
♪ ♪

32:39.527 --> 32:41.611
(cell one ringing)

32:43.464 --> 32:45.365
GRACE:
Where are we going, Danno?

32:45.383 --> 32:46.466
DANNY:
I'm gonna show you.

32:46.534 --> 32:47.751
This is, without question,

32:47.802 --> 32:50.053
the most beautiful view
on the planet Earth.

32:50.087 --> 32:52.973
This is a very
special place.

32:53.007 --> 32:54.224
Sit down.

32:54.258 --> 32:57.377
I actually came here on my
very first day to Hawaii.

32:57.395 --> 32:58.512
Really?
Yeah.

32:58.546 --> 32:59.930
I mean, it was an accident.

32:59.981 --> 33:02.098
See, I was driving around
and I got lost.

33:02.150 --> 33:03.183
This is very hard to do
on an island,

33:03.217 --> 33:04.835
but I managed
to figure it out.

33:05.736 --> 33:07.604
So I ran out of gas,

33:07.655 --> 33:10.273
ran right here and I ended up
sitting right here.

33:10.324 --> 33:13.276
I'm looking out at
this beautiful view.

33:13.327 --> 33:16.563
The only thing I can think
about is how homesick I was.

33:16.581 --> 33:20.233
I'd only been here half a day
and I'm already homesick.

33:20.251 --> 33:23.086
And I looked out
and I said, "You know,

33:23.120 --> 33:26.373
a view this beautiful, maybe
this rock ain't so bad, huh?"

33:26.407 --> 33:29.459
Then I came to my senses
and I realized the only way

33:29.510 --> 33:33.079
this place would be tolerable
is if I get to be here with you.

33:33.097 --> 33:34.914
That's the most
important thing to me.

33:34.932 --> 33:38.151
And that's never gonna change,
Monkey, okay?

33:40.254 --> 33:42.939
All right, a little kiss?

33:43.757 --> 33:45.258
Ah, that's the best.

33:45.276 --> 33:47.427
All right, I'll be right back.

34:04.879 --> 34:07.831
Hey, Rachel, it's Danny.

34:07.882 --> 34:09.616
Uh, listen.

34:09.634 --> 34:11.585
You know, I, uh...

34:11.619 --> 34:13.553
I didn't want it
to come to this,

34:13.588 --> 34:15.922
but you are leaving me
no choice.

34:15.956 --> 34:20.393
I'm gonna contest
the custody modification.

34:20.428 --> 34:23.146
There's zero chance I'm letting
you take Grace away from me.

34:23.179 --> 34:24.915
Okay? Not without a fight.

34:40.947 --> 34:42.916
You know, I think
a little takeout

34:42.949 --> 34:44.951
and a bottle of wine
sounds perfect.

34:44.985 --> 34:47.771
You know, and some flowers, too,
Adam.

34:49.507 --> 34:51.491
KONO:
Yeah, 'cause that's one way

34:51.509 --> 34:55.094
a boyfriend would apologize
for bad behavior.

34:55.129 --> 34:58.682
Yes, using duct tape
is very bad behavior.

34:58.716 --> 35:00.016
(keys jingling)

35:02.053 --> 35:03.853
(door opens, then closes)

35:14.039 --> 35:16.173
(buzzer sounding)

35:23.515 --> 35:25.418
Just sign here and
here, Lieutenant.

35:25.419 --> 35:27.536
Thanks.

35:34.061 --> 35:35.728
All right, now,
he's all yours.

35:35.762 --> 35:37.980
Let's go.

35:41.435 --> 35:43.102
This immunity and means thing

35:43.153 --> 35:45.271
you Five-O guys have
comes in pretty handy,

35:45.322 --> 35:47.323
doesn't it?

35:47.357 --> 35:49.609
Chaver was working
for you, wasn't she?

35:49.660 --> 35:51.244
Here you go.

35:56.617 --> 35:58.734
Get in.

36:16.136 --> 36:18.771
Hey, I did everything
you asked.

36:18.805 --> 36:20.723
I got you out.

36:20.757 --> 36:24.260
You said on the phone if I did,
you'd let my cousin go.

36:26.864 --> 36:28.931
Yeah.

36:28.949 --> 36:30.616
About that...

36:31.985 --> 36:34.103
You tell me where Kono is,
or you're a dead man.

36:34.121 --> 36:35.955
(laughs)

36:35.989 --> 36:39.041
Come on, Chin.
Use that big brain of yours.

36:41.879 --> 36:45.231
You know if I'm dead...
so is she.

36:47.134 --> 36:49.769
Right.

36:49.803 --> 36:52.138
Give me the gun.

36:59.930 --> 37:02.181
You realize, it's only
a matter or time.

37:02.232 --> 37:04.066
I'm gonna hunt you down.

37:04.101 --> 37:06.569
Spare me the hero crap, okay?

37:06.603 --> 37:08.688
'Cause you don't have the time.

37:08.739 --> 37:09.855
What are you talking about?

37:09.907 --> 37:14.143
Well, as the old saying goes,

37:14.161 --> 37:16.812
we got good news

37:16.830 --> 37:18.981
and bad news.

37:21.335 --> 37:23.169
Malia?

37:24.421 --> 37:25.838
What did you do?!

37:25.872 --> 37:26.956
Where is she?!

37:26.990 --> 37:28.374
Yeah.

37:28.425 --> 37:30.826
You're not gonna save her
like this.

37:30.844 --> 37:32.845
Why?

37:32.879 --> 37:35.281
Why are you doing this to me?!

37:37.000 --> 37:38.935
'Cause you got away with it.

37:38.969 --> 37:40.553
Got away with what?
What are you talking about?!

37:40.604 --> 37:43.672
Everybody knows
you're a dirty cop, Chin.

37:45.175 --> 37:48.194
But instead of having your life
ruined like the rest of us,

37:48.228 --> 37:51.013
you, uh...
you get your badge back?

37:51.031 --> 37:54.400
Hey, I didn't take any
of that damn drug money.

37:54.451 --> 37:58.054
No. No, but you knew who did,

37:58.088 --> 38:00.823
and you didn't say a word.

38:07.831 --> 38:11.700
Let 'em go,
Frank. Please.

38:11.718 --> 38:13.753
They got nothing
to do with this.

38:13.804 --> 38:17.323
Well, what happens to them
is entirely up to you, Chin.

38:18.892 --> 38:21.894
Either one of them are
15 minutes away, okay?

38:21.928 --> 38:24.897
The good news is, you have time
to save one of them.

38:24.931 --> 38:27.566
Bad news...

38:27.601 --> 38:29.551
unfortunately, the, uh...

38:29.569 --> 38:32.571
the other one's gonna die.

38:32.606 --> 38:35.658
You got what you wanted!

38:35.692 --> 38:38.411
You're out of jail.
You got your revenge.

38:38.445 --> 38:39.728
Fryer is dead!

38:39.746 --> 38:43.249
Your cousin set me up,
and then sent me to prison.

38:44.668 --> 38:47.903
Want to save Kono, hmm?

38:47.921 --> 38:50.539
You get in that boat
right there; you head due south.

38:50.573 --> 38:52.958
She's in a boat
two miles offshore.

38:53.010 --> 38:56.595
You want to reach Malia--

38:56.630 --> 39:01.434
well... she's at home
waiting for you with, uh,

39:01.468 --> 39:03.269
dinner in the oven.

39:03.303 --> 39:05.104
(gasps)

39:06.640 --> 39:08.391
Chicken, I think.

39:08.425 --> 39:09.758
(sighs)

39:09.776 --> 39:11.927
You son of a bitch.

39:14.614 --> 39:18.534
Hey, don't bother
stopping to call HPD

39:18.568 --> 39:20.202
or your buddies,
McGarrett and Williams.

39:20.237 --> 39:23.439
I got all the lines covered,
you understand?

39:23.457 --> 39:26.075
Besides, you don't have time.
You better get moving, Ace.

39:26.109 --> 39:28.260
Clock's ticking.

39:39.423 --> 39:41.623
(phone ringing)

39:43.793 --> 39:45.644
What's up, Frank?

39:47.230 --> 39:50.249
Dump her.

40:01.244 --> 40:03.195
(tires screeching)

40:03.246 --> 40:05.247
(door banging open)

40:05.282 --> 40:07.149
Malia?!

40:07.167 --> 40:09.168
Malia!

40:11.037 --> 40:13.923
Malia?

40:13.957 --> 40:15.925
Oh, no!

40:15.959 --> 40:18.010
Malia.

40:18.044 --> 40:19.762
Come on.

40:21.014 --> 40:24.600
Come on. Baby, it's Chin.

40:24.634 --> 40:26.635
Please talk to me.

40:26.670 --> 40:28.220
Baby.

40:28.271 --> 40:30.222
Go ahead, baby.

40:30.273 --> 40:33.225
Baby. Baby, it's Chin.

40:33.276 --> 40:35.561
Please, open your eyes.

40:35.612 --> 40:37.813
Please!

40:37.847 --> 40:40.449
That's good.

40:40.484 --> 40:42.518
I don't know what happened.

40:42.536 --> 40:44.620
It's okay. It's okay.

40:44.654 --> 40:46.355
Just save your strength, honey.

40:46.373 --> 40:48.491
Okay?

40:49.559 --> 40:50.459
(gasps)

40:53.547 --> 40:56.248
(touch tones sounding)

40:56.299 --> 40:59.034
Yeah, this is
Chin Ho Kelly, Five-O.

40:59.052 --> 41:01.053
I need an ambulance now!

41:29.499 --> 41:30.699
(sighs)

41:30.733 --> 41:32.901
<i>Arigato.</i>

41:34.120 --> 41:37.256
This village...

41:37.290 --> 41:39.091
I was here.

41:39.125 --> 41:42.678
Yeah. 18 hours
after I was.

41:44.414 --> 41:46.348
Where'd you go next?

41:46.383 --> 41:49.585
Another one of
Hiro Noshimuri's safe houses?

41:49.603 --> 41:51.587
Only way to survive was
to keep Shelburne moving.

41:51.605 --> 41:55.891
Hiro's got little shotgun shacks
all over the country.

42:03.149 --> 42:05.284
That's it.

42:06.486 --> 42:08.270
You wanted answers?

42:08.288 --> 42:10.556
They're all in there.

42:11.941 --> 42:13.959
You're not coming in?

42:13.994 --> 42:16.378
No.

42:16.413 --> 42:19.031
I think it's best
if you do this part alone.

42:20.950 --> 42:23.352
I'm sorry, son.

42:23.386 --> 42:25.487
For everything.

42:46.826 --> 42:49.745
Mom.
