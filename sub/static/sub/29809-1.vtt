00:27.261 --> 00:29.495
(Tom sighs)

00:29.497 --> 00:32.698
(somber piano music)

02:11.432 --> 02:12.531
- Dad?

02:12.533 --> 02:14.700
Where's your packing tape?

02:14.701 --> 02:16.868
- Jesus, Claire, how
did you get in here?

02:16.871 --> 02:18.770
- I have your spare
key, remember?

02:19.540 --> 02:20.405
- Oh.

02:20.407 --> 02:21.473
Just a minute.

02:21.474 --> 02:22.540
- What is all this stuff?

02:22.543 --> 02:26.378
- The prop designer quit so
I have to figure out a way

02:26.380 --> 02:28.313
to make a giant Venus flytrap.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.483
- I think you should
stick with directing.

02:31.485 --> 02:34.453
- Yeah, or acting, but
nobody wants to hire me

02:34.455 --> 02:37.556
for that anymore, oh boy.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.427
So you're gonna do this, huh?

02:43.898 --> 02:45.164
- I'm gonna do it.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.667
- Let me get to
that packing tape.

02:49.937 --> 02:52.704
(Claire sighs)

02:59.313 --> 03:00.245
- Dad?

03:01.715 --> 03:03.593
Do you think I'm too
old to be starting

03:03.594 --> 03:05.472
an acting career?

03:05.473 --> 03:07.351
- Absolutely not, but
I'll tell you what a guy

03:07.354 --> 03:08.554
once said to me.

03:08.556 --> 03:12.925
If you can make a living
any other way, do that.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.795
- I'm gonna make you proud.

03:16.797 --> 03:17.896
- You already have.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.966
- No, no.
- No, I fucking called you.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.734
I don't care what she told you.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.337
- Tim, come on.
- No, fuck.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.150
- [Man] Well, call
him back right now

03:27.151 --> 03:28.962
and say we're gonna get
on the phone with him.

03:28.963 --> 03:30.774
- No, that's not cutting it.
- It spreads flatter.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.144
- No, no, no.
- Back 35.

03:32.145 --> 03:33.511
- Back 30.
- I can't do better than 30.

03:33.512 --> 03:34.878
- Listen, I'm gonna
start you over.

03:34.879 --> 03:36.245
Today I have a brand new
stock for you to make 5000 on.

03:36.250 --> 03:38.017
- It's gone up a little
bit, but I can guarantee

03:38.018 --> 03:39.785
you'll make at least--
- Come on, man,

03:39.787 --> 03:43.322
where you going, come on,
come back to the phone.

03:43.324 --> 03:44.823
- Do we get paid?

03:44.825 --> 03:45.824
I'll Lyft you.
- I'll offer out.

03:45.826 --> 03:46.825
- What?

03:46.827 --> 03:49.761
Goddammit, all right,
treat me subject.

03:52.533 --> 03:53.532
Fuck.

03:53.533 --> 03:54.532
Hey, I'm sorry, we lost it.

03:54.535 --> 03:56.368
- 500.
- Say 200 more!

03:56.370 --> 03:59.671
(all men shout incomprehensibly)

03:59.673 --> 04:00.973
- We didn't have
a good day today.

04:00.975 --> 04:02.625
- What happened?

04:02.626 --> 04:04.276
- No one wants to do anything.

04:05.512 --> 04:08.380
Most guys on the sidelines
with all the volatility.

04:08.382 --> 04:09.781
Fed's on a roll.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.550
- Tom, with this rate,
we're gonna have to shut

04:11.552 --> 04:12.818
your operation down.

04:14.288 --> 04:15.587
- I think it's a cyclical thing.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.356
I wouldn't worry
too much just yet.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.725
- You have a negative
carryover from last year.

04:19.727 --> 04:21.638
- I know.

04:21.639 --> 04:23.550
I just need a couple of
big trades to cover that.

04:23.551 --> 04:25.462
- Are you taking out
the younger clients?

04:25.466 --> 04:26.832
- Yeah, I mean I'm on 'em.

04:29.336 --> 04:30.902
- Keep plugging away, I guess.

04:30.904 --> 04:31.903
- Okay.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.407
- Is something
else bothering you?

04:36.944 --> 04:39.678
- No. (snorts)

04:39.680 --> 04:41.780
Just was my brother's
birthday, so.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.916
- Oh, I'm sorry.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.563
- Hey, where are you going?

04:59.333 --> 05:01.633
- Oh, I have to go. (laughs)

05:01.635 --> 05:02.601
- [Chloe] Why?

05:03.871 --> 05:05.304
- I work. (laughs)

05:05.306 --> 05:07.339
- Do you want some coffee?

05:07.341 --> 05:08.707
- I don't drink coffee.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.942
- Can't you stay
a little longer?

05:10.944 --> 05:12.577
- I have an important meeting.

05:12.579 --> 05:14.646
- I thought we
were having lunch.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.315
- Can we take a rain check?

05:17.718 --> 05:19.718
- Come on, stay a bit?

05:20.721 --> 05:24.756
- I can't, it was really
nice meeting you, Carol.

05:24.758 --> 05:27.726
- Chloe.
- That's what I meant.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.461
- Do you have my number?
- Yes.

05:29.463 --> 05:30.462
- What is it?

05:31.532 --> 05:32.931
- I have in my phone.

05:36.437 --> 05:39.604
It's, yeah, I don't have it.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.412
- Here, call me.

05:48.782 --> 05:49.781
- Bye.

05:54.621 --> 05:56.855
(Simone sighs)

05:56.857 --> 05:59.891
(funky jazz music)

06:04.832 --> 06:08.467
- Hi, it's me, are we
still on for tonight?

06:08.469 --> 06:10.369
Good, I'll see you at six.

06:14.808 --> 06:19.044
- I have a completely
new paradigm on life.

06:20.147 --> 06:23.515
I am so so inspired
intellectually, philosophically

06:23.517 --> 06:25.517
and sexually.

06:25.519 --> 06:26.918
- What's a paradigm?

06:26.920 --> 06:29.154
- You have beautiful
hair, Justine.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.655
- Thank you.

06:30.657 --> 06:32.157
- You have to live the moment.

06:32.159 --> 06:34.543
Don't let anyone
tell you otherwise.

06:34.544 --> 06:36.928
Don't plan, don't
plan a thing, just do.

06:38.399 --> 06:40.899
That's my motto, like
that Nike commercial.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.402
- Just do it, you mean?

06:43.404 --> 06:45.170
- Let's go away you
weekend, you and me,

06:45.172 --> 06:48.673
wherever you wanna
go, St. Bart's, Paris.

06:48.675 --> 06:50.809
- Mario, I have a photo shoot.

06:50.811 --> 06:53.545
- No, no photo
shoot, that's work.

06:53.547 --> 06:54.679
We have to live.

06:54.681 --> 06:58.784
- But I'm sorry, I don't
think of you like that.

06:59.753 --> 07:00.752
- [Paige] Mario?

07:02.790 --> 07:04.022
- Paige.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.690
- What are you doing here?

07:05.692 --> 07:06.858
- Paige.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.535
How are you?

07:08.536 --> 07:10.211
- Why are you still in New York?

07:10.212 --> 07:11.887
I thought you were
going to London.

07:11.888 --> 07:13.563
- I was, but something came up.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.534
- Hi, I'm Justine.

07:15.536 --> 07:18.703
- Paige, Justine,
Justine, Paige.

07:20.774 --> 07:21.907
- What is going on?

07:21.909 --> 07:26.545
- Look, I just needed some
time to think over my life,

07:26.547 --> 07:28.613
okay, I was going to tell you.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.515
- The whole thing
was a lie, wasn't it?

07:30.517 --> 07:32.584
Why is this happening to me?

07:32.586 --> 07:35.754
What the fuck are you doing?
- Why are you so upset, honey?

07:35.756 --> 07:36.855
Have a drink.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.660
- I am breaking up with
you, you motherfucker.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.498
I hate you.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.100
(quirky music)

07:53.540 --> 07:56.641
- As you can see, it gets
plenty of natural light

07:56.643 --> 07:59.144
and of course you won't have
to worry about furniture.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.246
- How many square feet did
you say this was again?

08:01.248 --> 08:04.583
- Well, we measure from the
outside, so it's 250 square feet

08:04.585 --> 08:08.553
but I'd say it's about 200
square feet of livable space.

08:09.623 --> 08:10.622
- I see.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.627
- Oh, right, I forgot to
tell you the AC is broken,

08:15.629 --> 08:17.696
but you can just pick up
a new on at PC Richards

08:17.698 --> 08:21.199
for, like, $200,
any other questions?

08:21.201 --> 08:22.901
- No, I love it.

08:28.075 --> 08:31.126
(Claire sighs)

08:31.127 --> 08:34.178
- And the men's shirts go
here, stacked just like this.

08:35.082 --> 08:36.681
- Got it.

08:36.683 --> 08:39.251
- I gotta admit, I
can't stop flirting

08:39.253 --> 08:41.887
with all the good looking
guys that come in here.

08:41.889 --> 08:44.289
This city is full
of 'em, anyways,

08:44.291 --> 08:45.957
I'm going on my lunch break now.

08:45.959 --> 08:48.159
I'll show you the
stockroom when I get back.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.662
- Okay great, hi!

08:51.698 --> 08:53.031
- Hi, I'd like to
return this belt.

08:53.033 --> 08:56.768
- Okay, no problem,
not the right fit?

08:56.770 --> 08:59.037
- Well, actually I was
gonna use it as a whip

08:59.039 --> 09:01.840
on my date, but I
never got around to it.

09:02.843 --> 09:05.243
- Sure, if I could just
have your credit card.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.714
- I'm a little nuts.
- Not judging.

09:11.885 --> 09:12.884
Thank you.

09:14.688 --> 09:18.690
- Paige, that bitch, I thought
she never goes to that joint.

09:18.692 --> 09:19.891
- Murphy's Law.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.091
- She stormed out of there.

09:22.262 --> 09:23.979
- (sighs) What are you gonna do?

09:23.980 --> 09:25.697
- Tell her I needed to
spend some time with you

09:25.699 --> 09:28.633
and figure some shit out, so
I canceled the trip to London.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.235
- You expect her
to believe that?

09:30.237 --> 09:33.238
- Yeah, girls believe
anything they wanna believe.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.708
Like Justine, that
vixen, she won't fuck me.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.877
She's giving me that
friendship vibe.

09:38.879 --> 09:41.313
I met this Danish chick
at the Amsterdam airport.

09:41.315 --> 09:43.982
Off the hook, got
her to visit me.

09:45.319 --> 09:47.819
What do you got?

09:47.821 --> 09:49.220
- Nothing.

09:49.222 --> 09:51.856
- This city fucks with
your head, you know?

09:51.858 --> 09:55.126
We'd be married by now if we
were living in Boise, Idaho.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.928
So many chicks in New York.

09:58.599 --> 10:00.099
It's like this.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.600
You walk into Barney's
to buy a suit.

10:01.602 --> 10:03.235
And you can't choose

10:03.236 --> 10:04.869
'cause there's so many
fucking nice suits.

10:04.871 --> 10:06.905
You're picky because you
think you should be picky.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.840
You try one on and
you kinda like it

10:08.842 --> 10:12.210
but you don't buy it because
you want to keep looking.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.646
What I do is I just buy
up all the suits I can

10:14.648 --> 10:16.715
and then return them all.

10:16.717 --> 10:19.001
- Aren't you gonna
run out of suits?

10:19.002 --> 10:21.286
- No, you never run out of
suits, this is New York City.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.072
How's your work?

10:24.073 --> 10:25.990
- It's falling apart, I can't
seem to get anything going.

10:25.993 --> 10:29.160
- You gotta meet this Kyle guy,
he's a big fixed income dude

10:29.162 --> 10:30.612
at Phonics.

10:30.613 --> 10:32.063
- Street?
- Buy side.

10:32.065 --> 10:35.233
- I can't do business with
him, it's company policy.

10:35.235 --> 10:38.036
- Well, meet with him at least,
he'll give you some color.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.639
He's having a
fundraiser next week.

10:40.641 --> 10:43.775
You gotta dress up
though, it's a formal.

10:43.777 --> 10:44.743
- All right.

10:46.013 --> 10:48.179
- You see that brunette
at my one o'clock?

10:50.317 --> 10:51.816
I think I'm getting
a vibe from her.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.419
(quirky music)

10:54.421 --> 10:56.321
- No.
- Yes.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.922
- She's not looking over.

10:57.924 --> 11:00.692
- Let's go talk to
them. (whistles)

11:00.694 --> 11:03.228
(Tom sighs)

11:03.230 --> 11:06.665
Friend's cute, sold to
you, not a good cashflow.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.450
- So I met him on Tinder.

11:08.451 --> 11:10.234
He seemed totally normal,
he had a good job,

11:10.237 --> 11:12.737
close to his family
and then a month later,

11:12.739 --> 11:14.939
he ghosted me, not a word.

11:17.944 --> 11:19.411
- What's good to drink here?

11:22.115 --> 11:24.082
- We're drinking Merlot.

11:25.218 --> 11:28.186
- Merlot, if anybody orders
a Merlot, I'm leaving,

11:28.188 --> 11:29.988
I'm not fucking drinking Merlot.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.924
(quirky music)

11:32.926 --> 11:34.959
You know that line
from Sideways?

11:36.163 --> 11:40.932
- (laughs) Yeah, yeah, good
one, that's a good movie.

11:41.301 --> 11:41.966
- Three Merlots.

11:55.348 --> 11:57.115
- If you don't mind my
saying so, the whole idea

11:57.117 --> 11:59.250
is dangerous and ludicrous.

12:00.353 --> 12:01.486
The whole id--

12:03.990 --> 12:06.124
The whole idea is--

12:09.730 --> 12:12.464
(doorbell rings)

12:14.401 --> 12:17.268
- Nope, Henrietta,
don't hang up.

12:18.271 --> 12:21.439
Oh my God, let me
explain, Henri--

12:22.743 --> 12:23.842
- Everything okay?

12:26.513 --> 12:28.313
How's things?

12:28.315 --> 12:29.981
- Work's good.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.150
We're designing a new
building in Brooklyn.

12:32.152 --> 12:33.151
- [Tom] Awesome.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.387
- But Henrietta and I broke up.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.922
- Just now?

12:37.924 --> 12:41.526
- Two weeks ago, I
broke up with her.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.445
- I thought you were
in love with her.

12:43.446 --> 12:45.363
- You don't know what
it's like to wake up

12:45.365 --> 12:47.165
to the same minutia
over and over again.

12:47.167 --> 12:49.300
- Six months ago you
were sad and lonely.

12:49.302 --> 12:50.935
- You're one to talk.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.438
How long have you been
sad and lonely for?

12:53.440 --> 12:55.218
Three years?

12:55.219 --> 12:56.997
- Things didn't work
out with Isabella

12:56.998 --> 12:58.776
because she had
to move to Europe.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.445
I tried.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.112
- Well, you kinda
just mope around here.

13:02.115 --> 13:05.350
It's like, I don't
know, like you're stuck.

13:05.352 --> 13:06.885
- My business is
going down the tubes.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.853
I don't have time
for anything else.

13:09.823 --> 13:11.790
- Tom, you're miserable.

13:11.792 --> 13:14.159
You're killing yourself, I mean,

13:14.161 --> 13:15.744
look, you've done well

13:15.745 --> 13:17.328
and your brother
would be really proud.

13:17.330 --> 13:20.365
- I'm not gonna let what he
built crumble like this, okay?

13:20.367 --> 13:22.233
- I just want you to be happy.

13:22.235 --> 13:23.935
- Yeah, well.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.171
- You have to stop
being so antisocial.

13:26.173 --> 13:27.172
- Okay.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.722
- How's your friend Mario?

13:32.723 --> 13:34.434
I never got to meet him last
year at the Christmas party.

13:34.435 --> 13:36.146
- Yeah, you'll like
him, he's crazy.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.816
- Maybe I should date men.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.020
- Really?

13:46.092 --> 13:49.360
I can buy the fours and sell
the four and a halfs for 22.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.529
15, I can't hit that, bro.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.065
There's no money in it.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.969
I already passed on 17.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.106
I don't have anything else.

14:05.946 --> 14:06.611
Okay.

14:06.612 --> 14:07.277
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

14:08.315 --> 14:09.781
Hey Peter, I gotta
go to this thing.

14:09.782 --> 14:11.248
Can you check out?
- Sure.

14:18.558 --> 14:22.126
- Hey Simone, it's Tom, where
can I get a bow tie near me?

14:24.865 --> 14:27.398
Well, I had one but the
clip part thing broke off.

14:29.202 --> 14:33.571
Yeah, okay, okay, thanks.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.243
- We're closed.
- No.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.945
- We open again tomorrow at 10.

14:42.148 --> 14:43.481
- But you sell bow ties, yes?

14:43.483 --> 14:46.150
- We do but not right now.

14:46.152 --> 14:48.219
Try Bloomingdale's.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.287
- That's too far, I have this
work function in an hour,

14:50.290 --> 14:51.656
please?

14:51.657 --> 14:53.023
- Look, I would help
you, but I'm running late

14:53.026 --> 14:54.459
for an appointment myself.

14:55.295 --> 14:56.595
- Can I just grab one of those?

14:56.596 --> 14:57.896
I'll take five
minutes of your time.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.197
Please, it's really important.

15:00.567 --> 15:01.566
- Okay.

15:04.137 --> 15:05.270
Something like this?

15:08.041 --> 15:09.908
- Do you have a clip-on?
- We don't.

15:11.344 --> 15:12.827
- I don't know how to tie
this, can you show me?

15:12.828 --> 15:14.311
- I'm gonna be really
late for this audition.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.381
- Okay, okay, I'll
figure it out.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.150
- Credit card?
- Yes.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.488
What's the audition for?

15:23.490 --> 15:27.325
- An independent film.
- Nice, exciting.

15:27.327 --> 15:29.093
- Yeah, I'm nervous,
it's my first one.

15:29.095 --> 15:30.428
- Oh really?

15:30.430 --> 15:32.096
- Yeah, I just moved
here a week ago.

15:32.098 --> 15:35.033
- Where from?
- Pennsylvania.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.673
You know what, come with me.

15:44.678 --> 15:48.079
Cross that over the
top, pull it under,

15:49.215 --> 15:50.481
pull it back nice and tight,

15:50.483 --> 15:52.300
throw it over your
right shoulder,

15:52.301 --> 15:54.118
just watch for now.
- Sorry.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.054
- You're gonna make
your little bow

15:58.058 --> 15:59.023
like

15:59.626 --> 16:00.558
that.

16:09.636 --> 16:10.635
You think you got it?

16:10.636 --> 16:11.635
- Yeah, I got it,
I got it, I got it.

16:13.073 --> 16:14.072
- Okay.

16:24.017 --> 16:26.517
- Can I give you a ride?
- No, I gotta go.

16:32.058 --> 16:33.524
- Hey, your keys!

16:44.137 --> 16:46.337
- Hi, I'm here for the audition.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.139
- They left, you
just missed them.

16:48.141 --> 16:51.175
- I knew it, can you
just read with me

16:51.177 --> 16:52.377
and record the scene?

16:53.146 --> 16:54.712
- No, they took the equipment.

16:54.713 --> 16:56.279
- Here, here here
here, use my phone.

16:56.282 --> 16:57.649
You can email her the video.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.017
- No, I'm not gonna
use your iPhone,

16:59.019 --> 17:00.284
that's not even allowed.

17:01.287 --> 17:02.654
- Are they gonna
be back tomorrow?

17:02.655 --> 17:04.022
- No, today was the last day.

17:05.191 --> 17:09.260
(Claire groans in frustration)

17:13.133 --> 17:15.466
- I think the
party's over, my man.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.435
There's no more cheap paper.

17:17.437 --> 17:20.772
Buy side's losing money,
investors are pulling out,

17:20.774 --> 17:23.241
it is not what it
used to be, hey Burt.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.344
- You don't think the
rate hikes are gonna help?

17:26.345 --> 17:28.245
- People are moving
to different products.

17:28.248 --> 17:31.149
You're looking at junk
bonds and emerging markets

17:31.151 --> 17:34.052
for the next five years, ugh.

17:34.054 --> 17:37.588
- Yeah, I don't know anybody
in those sectors unfortunately.

17:39.793 --> 17:43.494
- Tell you what, I'll
introduce you to Gary.

17:43.496 --> 17:46.731
He's insane, but if you
can keep up with him,

17:46.733 --> 17:48.600
you have a shot.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.468
- I really appreciate
that, Kyle, thank you.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.341
(Tom sighs)

17:58.578 --> 18:02.246
(moody atmospheric music)

18:03.283 --> 18:04.866
- Hey, who's the best
quarterback ever?

18:04.867 --> 18:06.450
- Tom Brady.
- Get the fuck outta here.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.219
- He's got five rings, bro.
- What kind of New Yorker

18:08.221 --> 18:09.821
are you?
- How 'bout Terry Bradshaw?

18:09.823 --> 18:11.489
- Steelers, ah, yeah.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.858
Round of shots,
fellas, let's go.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.082
- Yeah.
- My wife says

18:15.083 --> 18:16.305
I can stay out late tonight.

18:16.306 --> 18:17.528
When the wife says
go for a touchdown,

18:17.530 --> 18:19.797
you go for the touchdown, right?

18:19.799 --> 18:22.600
(group cheers)

18:23.770 --> 18:27.238
I gotta tell you guys
something, New York is dead.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.874
Vegas is where is
it, baby, Vegas.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.576
- Vegas.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.781
(wind howls)

19:28.535 --> 19:31.335
(somber music)

19:57.697 --> 20:00.464
- You are a sight for sore eyes.

20:00.466 --> 20:01.699
- Oh, sorry I'm late.

20:04.571 --> 20:07.205
- You, I love everything
you got going on.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.207
- (laughs) Can we sit?

20:09.209 --> 20:10.208
- Oh.

20:13.646 --> 20:17.348
You are absolutely ravishing.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.585
- Are you always
this complimentary?

20:20.587 --> 20:22.453
- Only when I'm inspired.

20:24.924 --> 20:27.692
Here, try this risotto.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.628
It is amazing.

20:30.630 --> 20:33.431
(woman laughs)

20:35.535 --> 20:36.767
- Mmm.
- Right?

20:37.770 --> 20:39.670
- Mmm, delicious.
- Right?

20:39.672 --> 20:41.305
I love your hair.

20:43.243 --> 20:44.342
I'm a hair guy.

20:46.546 --> 20:48.379
- I just washed it.

20:48.381 --> 20:50.548
- You don't know what
you're doing to me.

20:51.417 --> 20:54.252
(woman laughs)

20:54.254 --> 20:55.620
- What am I doing to you?

20:55.622 --> 20:57.955
- There are a few
things in my daily life

20:57.957 --> 21:02.460
that I can say are
amazing, like this risotto,

21:02.462 --> 21:05.663
but in the rare moment when
something is more than amazing

21:05.665 --> 21:06.664
like a

21:06.666 --> 21:11.969
'98 Chateau Morgeaux
or an '85 Sasicaya,

21:13.406 --> 21:16.307
I call that sublime.

21:17.977 --> 21:18.943
- Really.

21:20.413 --> 21:22.513
- Do you know what
else is sublime?

21:26.619 --> 21:28.019
You.

21:28.021 --> 21:30.021
You are sublime.

21:37.964 --> 21:40.698
(woman moans)

21:44.637 --> 21:46.070
Get on your back.

21:49.575 --> 21:52.009
I bet your ass tastes
better than mountain butter.

21:52.011 --> 21:53.477
- What?
- Nothing.

21:54.447 --> 21:55.880
- Oh, you're dirty.

21:56.849 --> 21:59.550
(woman moans)

22:00.853 --> 22:03.721
- [Peter] I could show you
15 and a half bid, Rob.

22:03.723 --> 22:05.690
16 and four offers
repeating, Jerry.

22:06.693 --> 22:08.893
15 and 28 bid now and
I'm running out of room.

22:09.929 --> 22:12.863
I think it's a very
good bid, Rob, Rob?

22:14.934 --> 22:16.867
What, come on bro,
let's print this,

22:16.869 --> 22:18.502
we've worked on this a lot.

22:20.473 --> 22:22.006
Jerry, can you come up at all?

22:27.080 --> 22:28.379
What?

22:28.380 --> 22:29.679
Hey, I'm sorry, we lost it.

22:30.883 --> 22:32.683
No, I wasn't trying to
fuck you, I lost out too,

22:32.685 --> 22:34.518
he shopped us, what?

22:40.893 --> 22:42.026
- Can I help you?

22:46.466 --> 22:47.598
- I'm just browsing.

22:52.839 --> 22:56.841
- We have this fine
shirt from Maison Juke.

22:58.077 --> 23:01.712
Oh, my, that looks
fabulous on you.

23:01.714 --> 23:02.713
- No.

23:04.117 --> 23:06.384
- We have some other
very nice things.

23:09.689 --> 23:13.858
- Hi, I was here the
other night, you dropped--

23:13.860 --> 23:16.160
- Sorry, I'm helping
another customer.

23:16.161 --> 23:18.461
- Do you work out?
- Excuse me?

23:18.464 --> 23:22.066
- You have broad shoulders.
- Okay. (laughs)

23:22.068 --> 23:23.401
- What size are you?

23:25.638 --> 23:28.155
- Hey, I have your keys.

23:28.156 --> 23:30.673
- Oh my God, you have my
keys, where did you find them?

23:30.676 --> 23:32.643
- You dropped them, you
dropped them on your way out.

23:32.645 --> 23:36.080
- Dammit, it cost me $100 to
get into my own apartment.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.948
- I looked for you, but
you took off so fast.

23:37.950 --> 23:40.718
- [Claire] Well, I didn't
want to miss my audition.

23:41.888 --> 23:44.922
- Well, how'd it go?
- Didn't make it.

23:44.924 --> 23:47.658
- Oh Jesus, I'm sorry, my fault.

23:47.660 --> 23:50.161
- Well, yeah.
- I'm really sorry.

23:50.163 --> 23:52.430
- I'm sure there
will be plenty more.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.733
- I'd like to make it up to you.

23:55.734 --> 23:57.434
- Are you casting
for a feature film?

23:57.437 --> 23:59.637
- Yeah, right, I know
you're new to town.

23:59.639 --> 24:01.839
Are you a foodie?
- Nope.

24:01.841 --> 24:03.674
- Do you like operas?

24:03.675 --> 24:05.508
- [Seema] Aren't you off
this weekend, Claire?

24:05.511 --> 24:07.044
- Seema?

24:07.045 --> 24:08.578
- I could get Met
tickets for you.

24:11.484 --> 24:14.685
- (sighs) No opera.
- Have you been to--

24:14.687 --> 24:15.986
- How 'bout salsa dance?

24:18.624 --> 24:20.991
Salsa dancing?
- That sounds lovely.

24:20.993 --> 24:23.894
- I don't dance. (laughs)

24:26.833 --> 24:29.567
(Latin music)

24:39.078 --> 24:40.644
- [Woman] You wanna dance?

24:42.615 --> 24:44.048
- No, thank you.

24:44.884 --> 24:47.117
- Come on, Papi.
- No no,

24:47.119 --> 24:49.787
My girlfriend, I'm
waiting for my girlfriend.

24:49.789 --> 24:52.723
- We're just dancing.
- She gets really jealous.

24:52.725 --> 24:55.259
(Latin music)

25:04.604 --> 25:06.804
- You look very uncomfortable.

25:06.806 --> 25:09.807
- I think I pulled a neck
muscle at the gym, very sore.

25:09.809 --> 25:12.276
- So you're not
gonna dance with me?

25:12.278 --> 25:13.777
- I can barely bring my arm up.

25:13.779 --> 25:15.796
I think I should
just take it easy.

25:15.797 --> 25:17.814
- I saw you chug that drink.
- That was my right arm.

25:17.817 --> 25:20.117
- It's really easy.
- No.

25:20.119 --> 25:23.220
- No, seriously?
- I'm really bad.

25:23.222 --> 25:24.989
- I will show you.
- It's okay.

25:24.991 --> 25:26.974
It's fun watching you.

25:26.975 --> 25:28.958
- Might I remind you that
you made me miss my audition?

25:30.096 --> 25:32.696
- All right, fine, don't laugh.

25:32.698 --> 25:34.265
- I won't laugh.

25:34.267 --> 25:37.001
(Latin music)

25:43.809 --> 25:45.643
Try to relax.

25:45.645 --> 25:47.228
- It's just that,
when I was in college,

25:47.229 --> 25:48.812
my best buddy he made fun of me,

25:48.814 --> 25:50.948
I think I was
dancing to New Order.

25:52.151 --> 25:54.652
He said that I looked like
I was having a seizure.

25:54.654 --> 25:55.753
- What a jerk.

25:55.755 --> 25:57.288
- Well, he's probably right.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.893
- Don't let go.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.128
You should have seen yourself,
you looked petrified.

26:04.130 --> 26:06.581
- No.
- You did.

26:06.582 --> 26:09.033
- That was a walk in the park.
- Let's do it again next week.

26:09.035 --> 26:11.001
- I don't think so.
- Chicken.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.640
- Welcome to New York.

26:15.641 --> 26:17.341
- Hopefully soon you'll
be saying break a leg.

26:18.578 --> 26:21.211
- Yeah, how'd you
get into acting?

26:21.213 --> 26:25.049
- I grew up around it, my
dad was a struggling actor.

26:27.119 --> 26:29.153
And I don't know, maybe
I'm kidding myself.

26:29.155 --> 26:32.623
- Don't say that.
- I think I waited too long.

26:32.625 --> 26:35.225
- It's never too late, but

26:36.762 --> 26:39.296
you should've moved to
New York sooner, maybe?

26:39.298 --> 26:41.599
- I couldn't.
- Why not?

26:43.169 --> 26:44.368
- I was engaged.

26:45.972 --> 26:46.837
- Oh.

26:46.839 --> 26:47.838
- Yeah.

26:49.375 --> 26:52.242
I was gonna be a high school
drama teacher, actually,

26:53.245 --> 26:56.146
and my fiance, he
was in the Navy

26:56.148 --> 26:58.649
and he didn't make it
back from Afghanistan.

27:02.054 --> 27:03.754
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

27:08.628 --> 27:10.894
We were gonna buy a
house near Penn State

27:10.896 --> 27:13.130
so he could get his
MBA when he got out.

27:15.301 --> 27:17.234
- What was his name?
- Jared.

27:19.271 --> 27:21.021
- Thank you for your service.

27:21.022 --> 27:22.772
- I didn't mean to.
- No, I--

27:24.777 --> 27:25.909
I lost my brother

27:27.346 --> 27:28.879
on 9/11.

27:30.182 --> 27:33.017
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

27:34.186 --> 27:35.786
- What a crazy world.

27:37.723 --> 27:39.123
God, it was a crazy day.

27:39.125 --> 27:41.759
I remember exactly where I was.

27:42.361 --> 27:44.328
- I remember the night before.

27:45.331 --> 27:47.431
We had just come
back from a road trip

27:48.934 --> 27:50.968
and I was parking the car.

27:52.071 --> 27:55.172
He was waiting for me and

27:56.809 --> 28:00.277
he was standing there and he
smiled at me, in a way that

28:01.981 --> 28:03.380
he had never smiled before.

28:05.951 --> 28:07.217
I'll never forget that.

28:08.354 --> 28:10.087
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

28:11.057 --> 28:14.758
- What was his name?
- Dan, Danny.

28:15.695 --> 28:17.828
- What did he do?
- He was a bond broker.

28:19.031 --> 28:22.232
- Isn't that what you did?
- I took over his business.

28:22.234 --> 28:25.869
I needed a job, my parents were
financially dependent on us

28:25.871 --> 28:28.105
at the time, but.

28:30.109 --> 28:31.642
I was gonna be a writer,

28:31.643 --> 28:33.176
I was working on
my master's at NYU.

28:34.046 --> 28:36.013
- So you never finished?

28:38.384 --> 28:40.384
Do you ever think
about going back?

28:40.386 --> 28:43.120
- I thought about night
school, but just too busy.

28:46.859 --> 28:48.125
What?

28:48.127 --> 28:49.393
- You're not a bad guy.

28:51.197 --> 28:53.864
(Tom laughs)

29:12.218 --> 29:13.751
Thank you for dinner.

29:14.754 --> 29:16.520
And for attempting to dance.

29:16.522 --> 29:17.521
- Welcome.

29:20.392 --> 29:22.993
Do you want to go
biking next weekend?

29:22.995 --> 29:24.762
- Are you asking me out, Tom?

29:27.800 --> 29:29.967
- I just thought
I'd be your friend.

29:32.138 --> 29:34.522
- I heard a lot of
guys in New York

29:34.523 --> 29:36.907
were afraid of being
rejected with their big egos.

29:38.511 --> 29:42.112
- I'm not afraid of rejection,
I'm afraid of, yeah.

29:42.114 --> 29:43.881
- What are you afraid of?

29:43.883 --> 29:45.966
- Nothing.

29:45.967 --> 29:48.050
- You are gonna be my first
guy friend in New York.

29:48.988 --> 29:49.987
- There you go.

29:52.858 --> 29:54.458
Night.
- Good night.

30:11.544 --> 30:14.344
(phone rings)

30:14.346 --> 30:16.079
- Mr. Heeney's office?

30:16.882 --> 30:17.881
Just a moment.

30:17.883 --> 30:22.219
Mario, there's a
Jill on line one.

30:23.489 --> 30:25.823
- Who?

30:25.825 --> 30:27.591
- Hello, what is your last name?

30:29.161 --> 30:31.995
She says her name
is Jill Hansen.

30:35.201 --> 30:38.001
- Tell her I'm
out of the office,

30:38.003 --> 30:40.838
I'm out of town for business.
- Sure.

30:40.840 --> 30:43.106
(quirky music)

30:43.108 --> 30:47.110
Hello, Miss Hansen, Mr.
Haney is out of the office.

30:47.112 --> 30:48.111
- Simone.

30:49.381 --> 30:52.049
- Oh my God, Nicole,
you can't do this.

30:52.051 --> 30:53.851
- I just wanna spend some
quality time with you.

30:53.853 --> 30:55.419
Is that so bad?

30:55.421 --> 30:56.854
- What?

30:56.856 --> 30:58.522
Yes.
- No one has to know.

30:59.925 --> 31:02.443
- (laughs) You're the one
who's getting married.

31:02.444 --> 31:04.962
- I don't know anymore, I may
just need to think about that.

31:04.964 --> 31:07.564
- Well, don't not get
married on account of me.

31:07.566 --> 31:08.632
- I love you.

31:08.634 --> 31:12.169
- Jesus, Nicole,
you barely know me.

31:12.171 --> 31:14.404
We worked together
for five months.

31:14.406 --> 31:16.974
This is getting really weird,
the way you're stalking me.

31:16.976 --> 31:18.559
- I feel you understand me,

31:18.560 --> 31:20.143
I really cherished
our time together.

31:21.146 --> 31:22.880
- (laughs) You're just confused.

31:22.882 --> 31:25.549
- I wanna make love to you.
- Nicole, no.

31:25.551 --> 31:27.451
- Why not?
- First of all,

31:27.453 --> 31:29.953
I am not gonna be your
bicurious guinea pig.

31:29.955 --> 31:34.291
Second of all, I'm trying to
figure my own shit out, okay?

31:34.293 --> 31:38.195
- You're not attracted to me?
- No, yes,

31:38.197 --> 31:39.162
that's not the point.

31:39.164 --> 31:41.131
- Just once, please?

31:41.133 --> 31:43.467
I think I'm making a big
mistake marrying Victor.

31:43.469 --> 31:45.402
- Well, I can't
help you with that.

31:46.472 --> 31:49.973
- Hey, please?

31:55.247 --> 31:56.914
- Do you have a strap on?

31:56.916 --> 31:59.917
- Strap on?
- A dildo, a strap on dildo.

32:00.452 --> 32:01.919
- No.

32:01.921 --> 32:04.521
(quirky music)

32:09.061 --> 32:10.594
- It's not a race!

32:13.299 --> 32:14.464
It's not a race!

32:14.466 --> 32:17.267
(gentle music)

32:33.619 --> 32:34.985
- It's nice out here.

32:36.055 --> 32:37.054
- Yeah.

32:40.492 --> 32:43.093
Do you think you could swim
across to the other side?

32:43.095 --> 32:45.462
- I don't know, is
it about a mile?

32:45.464 --> 32:46.463
- I think so.

32:46.465 --> 32:50.567
- I'm a wicked back
stroker, so probably.

32:50.569 --> 32:53.070
- I wish I were
a better swimmer.

32:53.072 --> 32:54.171
- It takes practice.

32:56.575 --> 32:58.675
- Would you try and save
me if I were drowning?

33:00.079 --> 33:02.479
- I don't know, Tom, I don't
know how good of friends

33:02.481 --> 33:03.480
we are just yet.

33:06.118 --> 33:08.385
(Tom laughs)

33:08.387 --> 33:09.386
- Fair enough.

33:25.270 --> 33:28.438
- What's with the orange bike?

33:28.440 --> 33:30.640
- My ex wanted a colorful pair,

33:30.642 --> 33:32.609
so now I'm just
stuck with this one.

33:34.079 --> 33:35.779
- How long were
you guys together?

33:37.282 --> 33:40.217
- Two years, it
was long distance.

33:41.086 --> 33:43.520
- Where?
- Paris.

33:43.522 --> 33:47.024
- Wow.
- Yeah, we Skyped a lot

33:47.026 --> 33:48.325
and really enjoyed that

33:48.326 --> 33:49.625
not being able to see
each other feeling.

33:50.562 --> 33:52.195
- So the distance killed it?

33:54.400 --> 33:56.133
- I guess, who the hell knows?

33:58.170 --> 33:59.236
- Were you in love with her?

34:03.342 --> 34:04.341
- I guess.

34:06.178 --> 34:08.678
- I was in love with Jared,
just not in that desperate way,

34:08.680 --> 34:10.147
you know?

34:10.149 --> 34:11.782
We were together
for a long time.

34:19.525 --> 34:22.192
So you said you're not
afraid of being rejected.

34:23.729 --> 34:25.062
- What?

34:25.064 --> 34:27.397
- After dinner the other night.

34:27.399 --> 34:32.536
- Oh, yeah, no, I mean, no.

34:33.305 --> 34:34.538
- So what are you afraid of?

34:36.542 --> 34:39.242
- Nothing, I'm pretty
sure we're all gonna die.

34:39.244 --> 34:41.344
- Don't sugarcoat it.

34:41.346 --> 34:43.213
- That's one way
of looking at it.

34:43.215 --> 34:44.448
Why be afraid of anything?

34:44.450 --> 34:45.682
It'll all be over soon.

34:48.187 --> 34:49.186
But

34:51.490 --> 34:55.092
I mean, you lose people love,
I guess it makes you clam up.

35:00.833 --> 35:04.434
- And you don't like
opening up, do you?

35:24.723 --> 35:26.656
- Well, we've come to
the end of the road.

35:26.658 --> 35:30.861
- It's a nice ending.
- Had a nice time.

35:30.863 --> 35:33.730
- Me too, thanks for everything.

35:33.732 --> 35:34.764
- You're welcome.

35:38.604 --> 35:40.504
So you're gonna
catch the C train?

35:42.741 --> 35:43.740
- Yep.

35:45.444 --> 35:47.911
- I guess I'll see you later.

35:56.255 --> 35:59.422
(somber piano music)

36:22.214 --> 36:24.848
(Claire sighs)

36:48.407 --> 36:51.208
(quirky music)

37:25.344 --> 37:26.509
- Hey, Simone.

37:26.511 --> 37:29.879
I'm not sure what I
should be getting.

37:29.881 --> 37:31.681
- [Simone] What's the problem?

37:31.683 --> 37:34.584
- Well, there's a lot of stuff.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.753
- [Simone] Well, then,
get a bunch of stuff.

37:36.755 --> 37:39.489
- But I don't--

37:40.525 --> 37:42.292
- [Simone] Get the harness kit.

37:44.463 --> 37:46.796
- The harness kit?
- Yes, the harness kit.

37:57.009 --> 37:58.308
- Could I help you?

37:58.910 --> 37:59.876
- No.

38:02.414 --> 38:05.015
(quirky music)

38:28.307 --> 38:29.939
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

38:31.009 --> 38:32.976
- You don't have to do that.

38:32.978 --> 38:33.977
- Okay.

38:36.048 --> 38:39.749
- So is this what you've
been fantasizing about?

38:41.653 --> 38:42.536
- Yes.

38:42.537 --> 38:43.420
- There's no turning back.

38:43.989 --> 38:44.954
- No.

38:45.991 --> 38:48.825
(quirky music)

38:55.000 --> 38:57.834
(Nicole gasps)

39:02.941 --> 39:05.742
(Nicole moans)

40:02.801 --> 40:03.833
- Eloquent.

40:21.887 --> 40:24.554
¶ She'll be coming around
the mountain when she comes ¶

40:24.556 --> 40:27.090
¶ She'll be coming around
the mountain when she comes ¶

40:27.092 --> 40:29.204
¶ She'll be coming
around the mountain ¶

40:29.205 --> 40:31.317
¶ She'll be coming
around the mountain ¶

40:31.318 --> 40:33.430
¶ She'll be coming around
the mountain when she comes ¶

40:33.432 --> 40:36.833
¶ She'll be pulling six
white horses when she comes ¶

40:36.835 --> 40:40.003
¶ She'll be pulling six
white horses when she comes ¶

40:40.005 --> 40:41.571
¶ She'll be coming
around the mountain ¶

40:41.572 --> 40:43.138
¶ She'll be coming
around the mountain ¶

40:43.141 --> 40:44.774
- Fuck, fuck you!

40:47.546 --> 40:48.511
Fuck!

40:52.851 --> 40:53.984
- What do you have for me?

40:53.985 --> 40:55.118
- I can generate some momentum

40:55.120 --> 40:57.554
with a couple of buy side guys.

40:57.556 --> 40:59.022
- Tom, you know
there's a hard wall

40:59.023 --> 41:00.489
between retail and
street brokers.

41:00.492 --> 41:02.091
- Historically, I
understand that that's true,

41:02.093 --> 41:04.861
but small shops have
weak sales coverage

41:04.863 --> 41:06.463
and there's where I
can make a difference.

41:06.465 --> 41:08.798
- If even one client
makes a stink about it,

41:08.800 --> 41:10.634
I gotta deal with
the consequences.

41:10.635 --> 41:12.469
- I would only work with
guys that don't have

41:12.471 --> 41:13.848
a problem with it.

41:13.849 --> 41:15.226
- I know you'd do
the right thing.

41:15.227 --> 41:16.604
It's about perception,
I can't risk it.

41:16.608 --> 41:18.775
- Then how do you expect
me to prop this up?

41:18.777 --> 41:20.743
- You need to focus
on the younger guys.

41:20.745 --> 41:24.147
- I am doing, it's
not about personality,

41:24.149 --> 41:25.815
it's about general lack of flow.

41:25.817 --> 41:28.001
- I agree to disagree.

41:28.002 --> 41:30.186
Whatever it is, if you
can't put up the numbers,

41:30.188 --> 41:32.555
I gotta come up
with some solutions.

41:37.128 --> 41:38.161
- Is this seat taken?

41:38.163 --> 41:39.996
No, it's not taken.

41:39.998 --> 41:41.631
Mind if I sit down?

41:42.901 --> 41:43.900
No, go ahead.

41:43.902 --> 41:45.168
Mind if I,

41:46.671 --> 41:47.170
mind if I--

41:51.243 --> 41:52.208
Dammit.

42:08.527 --> 42:09.759
Hi, hey.

42:11.863 --> 42:13.663
Fine, how are you?

42:15.800 --> 42:16.966
I was just wondering if.

42:32.784 --> 42:34.284
- Hi, come on in.

42:34.286 --> 42:35.685
- I brought you wine.

42:36.855 --> 42:37.720
- You didn't have
to, but thank you.

42:37.722 --> 42:39.172
- No big deal.

42:39.173 --> 42:40.623
- Bring your script?
- Yeah.

42:41.693 --> 42:43.293
I appreciate you helping me.

42:43.295 --> 42:45.828
It's just hard not working
off of someone, you know?

42:45.830 --> 42:49.866
- No, yeah, anything
for a struggling artist.

42:50.969 --> 42:52.602
- What are you making?

42:52.603 --> 42:54.236
- My specialty if
you want to call it.

42:55.106 --> 42:56.739
Spaghetti a la Bologne.

42:56.741 --> 42:58.575
- Yum, aren't you
the master chef?

42:58.577 --> 43:00.710
- I cook out of necessity.

43:02.714 --> 43:04.280
Oh, wine?
- Sure.

43:05.016 --> 43:08.151
(light piano music)

43:15.093 --> 43:16.125
- Here's to...

43:17.862 --> 43:21.030
It's good to see you.
- It's good to see you too.

43:21.032 --> 43:23.900
(glasses clink)

43:25.604 --> 43:27.320
Can I help?

43:27.321 --> 43:29.037
- Yeah, sure, do you want
to chop up some garlic?

43:29.040 --> 43:30.640
- Sure.
- Oh, sorry.

43:32.611 --> 43:33.610
There you go.

43:38.817 --> 43:41.718
You know, I was gonna
call you the other day

43:41.719 --> 43:44.620
after we biked, but I
don't know, I just--

43:44.623 --> 43:47.890
- No, I was gonna call you
too, I just didn't know.

43:47.892 --> 43:48.891
- No, it's okay.

43:54.299 --> 43:56.132
- Shall we?
- Yes.

44:03.642 --> 44:04.841
You must be hungry.

44:07.379 --> 44:09.312
- I'm eating too fast.
- A little bit.

44:09.314 --> 44:11.314
- I hate it when that happens.

44:11.316 --> 44:13.650
It's a habit I
picked up from work.

44:13.652 --> 44:16.853
I, um, we don't get
lunch breaks, you know?

44:16.855 --> 44:20.156
Client calls, we have to
drop everything we're doing.

44:20.158 --> 44:21.157
- It's okay.

44:23.795 --> 44:25.061
- I'm glad you're here.

44:26.031 --> 44:27.230
- I'm glad to be here.

44:31.736 --> 44:34.170
- I'm reading the part of?
- Jimmy.

44:34.172 --> 44:36.205
- And you're there.
- Yep.

44:36.207 --> 44:37.807
- This is weird.
- I know.

44:38.743 --> 44:40.410
- So?

44:40.411 --> 44:42.078
- It's about a vampire
who wants to take over

44:42.080 --> 44:45.748
a sleepy town, you're at a
bar minding your own business.

44:46.785 --> 44:48.251
- Okay.

44:48.253 --> 44:51.354
- Is this seat taken?
- No, it's not taken.

44:52.223 --> 44:53.923
- Mind if I look at the menu?

44:53.925 --> 44:58.728
- No, go ahead, do you know
what time the sun sets today?

44:58.730 --> 45:00.329
- No, that's my line.
- Sorry.

45:01.299 --> 45:03.700
- Do you know what time
the sun sets today?

45:03.702 --> 45:04.767
- I'm not sure.

45:04.769 --> 45:08.371
- Daylight is overrated,
what do you do?

45:09.374 --> 45:12.241
- I'm a writer, I
am a writer, sorry.

45:15.213 --> 45:17.380
- You want a good story?
- What do you have in mind?

45:17.382 --> 45:20.116
- A vampire couple
taking over this town.

45:20.118 --> 45:23.119
- Good one.
- Okay,

45:23.121 --> 45:24.721
that was not in the script.

45:24.723 --> 45:26.789
- Yes it was.
- All right.

45:28.093 --> 45:29.425
- What is that?

45:30.195 --> 45:31.194
- Oh.

45:35.433 --> 45:39.402
This was me freshman in college.

45:39.404 --> 45:42.071
- So young.
- So dorky.

45:42.073 --> 45:44.040
- Everyone's a dork at 18.

45:44.042 --> 45:45.441
- Were you a dork at 18?

45:47.011 --> 45:50.480
- Bad complexion,
baby fat, glasses.

45:52.183 --> 45:54.100
- Ouch.

45:54.101 --> 45:56.018
- I was also in
the marching band.

45:56.020 --> 45:57.954
- That's sexy, you know?

45:57.956 --> 45:59.489
- Maybe in Oklahoma.

46:00.892 --> 46:04.260
- I'm sure you were as
beautiful as you are now.

46:07.298 --> 46:08.064
- That is the nicest compliment.

46:12.904 --> 46:15.171
- Do you want another
glass of wine?

46:15.173 --> 46:17.440
- No, thanks.
- I'll get one.

46:23.314 --> 46:26.516
(somber piano music)

46:44.169 --> 46:45.468
- I think I should go.

46:46.471 --> 46:48.805
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I should go.

46:50.475 --> 46:52.208
- Let me know how
the audition goes.

46:52.210 --> 46:54.310
- I will, good night.
- Night.

46:55.079 --> 46:58.281
(somber piano music)

47:03.288 --> 47:04.420
- So what happened?

47:07.158 --> 47:09.058
- Nothing. (scoffs)

47:09.060 --> 47:10.359
- But you like her.

47:12.397 --> 47:14.096
- Yeah, I like her.

47:15.466 --> 47:16.899
- Tom.

47:16.901 --> 47:19.185
Don't fuck this up.

47:19.186 --> 47:21.470
- I didn't fuck anything
up, I didn't do anything.

47:21.472 --> 47:22.905
- That's what I meant.

47:22.907 --> 47:23.906
- Just cool it.

47:23.908 --> 47:26.843
- Let me go talk to her.
- Don't fucking talk to her.

47:26.845 --> 47:28.411
Don't fucking talk to her.

47:28.412 --> 47:29.978
- Do you know what's
going to happen?

47:29.981 --> 47:33.182
You are going to turn 60 and
you are going to die alone.

47:33.184 --> 47:35.551
- Don't get all dramatic,
what about you, man?

47:35.553 --> 47:37.553
What do you got going on?

47:37.554 --> 47:39.554
- I fucked this chick.
- Oh, you fucked this chick.

47:39.557 --> 47:41.891
You're making some incredible
progress in your life.

47:41.893 --> 47:45.928
- Okay, okay, it was
stupid, it was nothing,

47:45.930 --> 47:48.998
but I am learning from
my mistakes, you--

47:51.135 --> 47:53.402
You know what, I really
don't wanna fight.

47:53.404 --> 47:54.637
Just let me go talk to her.

47:54.639 --> 47:55.638
- No.

48:06.284 --> 48:07.884
- Ah, the belt?

48:07.886 --> 48:10.119
- Oh. (laughs)

48:11.122 --> 48:13.656
No, that's our little
secret, by the way.

48:13.658 --> 48:15.925
- Mum's the word, what
can I help you with?

48:15.927 --> 48:18.027
- Well, actually, I'm
going to this swanky event

48:18.029 --> 48:21.030
with my boyfriend and I
need a fabulous new look.

48:21.032 --> 48:22.932
- So something a
bit more formal?

48:24.168 --> 48:26.335
- Oh, oh, I think I like this.

48:26.337 --> 48:28.237
- I love that one.

48:29.641 --> 48:31.641
- Would you wear this
for your boyfriend?

48:31.643 --> 48:35.978
- Yeah, I mean, I'm not with
anyone at the moment, but.

48:35.980 --> 48:38.948
- No way, I don't believe
you, you're so pretty.

48:38.950 --> 48:40.917
- (laughs) Thanks.

48:40.919 --> 48:43.920
I met a guy, but I don't
think it's going to work out.

48:43.922 --> 48:45.588
- Oh, that sucks.

48:45.590 --> 48:47.323
You're just not that into him.

48:48.426 --> 48:51.010
- I am.

48:51.011 --> 48:53.595
But he's just very
detached, you know?

48:53.598 --> 48:56.599
- Oh, I know,
believe me, I know.

48:57.335 --> 48:59.068
My boyfriend was the same way.

48:59.070 --> 49:00.703
New York City dudes are weird.

49:00.705 --> 49:03.006
Takes a while to get
'em out of their shell,

49:03.007 --> 49:05.308
but you know what, I don't
think you should give up on him.

49:05.310 --> 49:08.344
Nice guys are hard to find,
so many jerks out there.

49:09.614 --> 49:11.047
- Yeah, maybe.

49:12.250 --> 49:13.950
Did you want to try that on?

49:13.952 --> 49:15.718
- Oh, yeah, sure.

49:18.189 --> 49:19.655
(Simone chuckles)

49:19.657 --> 49:21.474
- Here's what I can do for you.

49:21.475 --> 49:23.292
There's gonna be an opening
in client relations.

49:23.294 --> 49:24.660
I want you to consider it.

49:26.965 --> 49:28.097
- Client relations?

49:29.400 --> 49:31.133
That's part of my job.

49:31.135 --> 49:33.102
- This is at the
corporate level.

49:33.103 --> 49:35.070
Strategic planning advice,
things of that nature.

49:36.140 --> 49:37.506
- Aren't we a management
consulting firm?

49:37.508 --> 49:39.475
- Tom, I'm trying to help you.

49:41.179 --> 49:42.912
- I'm not qualified,
nor am I interested

49:42.913 --> 49:44.646
in telling clients how to
run their business, okay?

49:44.649 --> 49:46.983
- Well, we may have
to make some changes.

49:49.988 --> 49:51.587
- You're gonna replace me.

49:51.589 --> 49:53.589
- I have to keep
that option open.

49:53.591 --> 49:55.057
- What do you
think's gonna happen?

49:55.058 --> 49:56.524
You bring in a new
person and suddenly

49:56.527 --> 49:58.294
revenue's gonna
start pouring in?

49:58.296 --> 50:00.129
- Hey, I have my
responsibilities.

50:00.131 --> 50:01.731
- Just tell me one thing,
have I done a good job for you

50:01.733 --> 50:04.266
in the past 16 years?
- You have.

50:04.268 --> 50:06.569
- Then why would you
trust that some other guy

50:06.571 --> 50:08.471
with less experience

50:08.473 --> 50:10.539
is gonna be able to
run this thing better?

50:10.541 --> 50:12.742
- Look, the business
is changing.

50:12.744 --> 50:14.777
Younger traders are
running the show.

50:17.315 --> 50:19.215
- No one knows this
product better than I do.

50:19.217 --> 50:20.416
- This isn't personal.

50:24.155 --> 50:26.088
- I don't know how
else to take it.

50:32.563 --> 50:34.530
- Okay, let's figure this out,

50:34.532 --> 50:36.665
how do we get you back on track?

50:36.667 --> 50:39.335
- I could talk to
the regionals, but

50:39.337 --> 50:41.303
that's just adding another
step to get to the same spot.

50:41.305 --> 50:43.005
- But it's another
counter party.

50:43.006 --> 50:44.706
- I don't need another counter
party, I need more flow.

50:44.709 --> 50:45.708
- Okay.

50:45.710 --> 50:48.210
- Hi.
- Hey, good news?

50:48.212 --> 50:50.046
- I got the part.
- That's great!

50:50.048 --> 50:51.180
- Break a leg!

50:53.484 --> 50:54.951
- Claire, this is Mario.

50:54.952 --> 50:56.419
- Tom didn't mention
you're beautiful.

50:56.421 --> 50:59.255
- He didn't, so unkind.
- Really.

50:59.257 --> 51:00.456
- All right, knock it off, do
you guys want a drink or what?

51:00.458 --> 51:01.590
- Get three Merlots.

51:06.330 --> 51:08.464
I have a beautiful
villa in Tuscany.

51:08.466 --> 51:10.950
I wish you could see it.

51:10.951 --> 51:13.435
It's 600 years old and
the stones that they used

51:13.438 --> 51:17.473
to build this house date
back to the Roman Empire,

51:17.475 --> 51:19.642
can you believe it?
- Really?

51:19.644 --> 51:22.711
- I built this outdoor
oven, I make my own pizza.

51:22.713 --> 51:23.779
Do you like pizza?

51:23.781 --> 51:25.932
- I love pizza.

51:25.933 --> 51:28.084
- You know, I serve on the
board of an off Broadway

51:28.086 --> 51:29.485
theater company.

51:29.487 --> 51:32.822
- Which one?

51:32.823 --> 51:36.158
- The Pine or Pearl Theater,
it's been so long that I forget

51:37.161 --> 51:38.850
- Well, it's important
for me to be networking.

51:38.851 --> 51:40.540
I gotta get out there and
meet people in the industry.

51:40.541 --> 51:42.230
- Take my number down,
we should hang out.

51:42.233 --> 51:43.766
(phone rings)

51:43.768 --> 51:47.169
- Oh, sorry, I have to
take this call, excuse me.

51:50.141 --> 51:51.107
- Ooh.

51:54.245 --> 51:56.712
You're not together, are you?

51:57.882 --> 51:59.248
- No.

51:59.250 --> 52:00.783
- Mind if I try to get in there?

52:01.619 --> 52:03.436
- Mario, you know I don't mind,

52:03.437 --> 52:05.254
but just don't go there
unless you're serious.

52:05.256 --> 52:07.123
- Well, in that case, forget it.

52:09.260 --> 52:10.726
- Why do you have
to treat every girl

52:10.728 --> 52:12.795
like it's a transaction?

52:12.797 --> 52:16.866
- Because it is a transaction,
everything is a transaction.

52:16.868 --> 52:20.169
There's a bid and an offer,
it takes two to make a market,

52:20.171 --> 52:22.404
it takes two to tango,
what's your problem?

52:22.406 --> 52:24.740
- All you see is
a piece of meat.

52:24.742 --> 52:26.408
You know they have
feelings, hopes and dreams,

52:26.410 --> 52:28.010
but you don't give a fuck.

52:28.011 --> 52:29.611
- Yeah, well, I have
hopes and dreams too.

52:29.612 --> 52:31.212
I'm lining up for happiness
just like everybody else.

52:31.215 --> 52:33.582
Maybe all they see
is dollar signs

52:33.584 --> 52:36.819
and my incredible charm,
who are you to judge?

52:36.821 --> 52:39.188
- I'll stop judging once
you stop using people

52:39.190 --> 52:41.541
like they're a
fucking commodity.

52:41.542 --> 52:43.893
- Everybody uses everybody,
what, are you fucking naive?

52:46.497 --> 52:48.464
You know what your problem is?

52:48.465 --> 52:50.432
You're too chickenshit
to do anything about it.

53:01.846 --> 53:04.813
(doorbell rings)

53:10.521 --> 53:12.922
- Why did you storm
off like that?

53:12.924 --> 53:15.324
- I thought I'd give you
and Mario some privacy.

53:15.326 --> 53:16.859
- That is not fair.

53:16.861 --> 53:18.861
- I said we're friends,
so we're friends.

53:18.863 --> 53:20.746
You don't have to look
to me for approval.

53:20.747 --> 53:22.630
- What is wrong with you,
why are you acting this way?

53:22.633 --> 53:24.567
- Claire, what do
you want from me?

53:25.803 --> 53:27.670
- Why can't you admit that
you have feelings for me?

53:27.672 --> 53:29.806
- Because I don't.

53:29.807 --> 53:31.941
- You can lie to me, Tom,
but don't lie to yourself.

53:32.877 --> 53:34.610
- Are you so afraid
of being hurt

53:34.611 --> 53:36.344
that you will never allow
yourself to be happy?

53:36.347 --> 53:37.947
- I'm just fine, thank you.

53:37.949 --> 53:41.817
- You are not fine, I can
see that you're not fine.

53:41.819 --> 53:43.619
You put up this facade
like you don't give a shit

53:43.621 --> 53:47.923
about anything, look,
I have done that

53:47.925 --> 53:51.227
and it is not fun and there
is no place to go from there.

53:52.496 --> 53:54.563
We both have suffered
life altering losses,

53:54.565 --> 53:56.565
but that does not mean
that we have to spend

53:56.567 --> 53:59.001
the rest of our
lives being numb.

53:59.003 --> 54:02.338
(gentle piano music)

54:14.819 --> 54:17.353
(Tom sobs)

54:21.559 --> 54:24.693
(light piano music)

54:27.965 --> 54:33.302
- Would you like a knish or a
pretzel or a hot dog, maybe?

54:33.771 --> 54:35.738
- Hot dog? (laughs)

54:35.740 --> 54:37.339
- Okay, hot dog.

54:38.342 --> 54:40.442
Could we get two
hot dogs, please?

54:41.345 --> 54:42.344
Ah.

54:42.913 --> 54:46.048
(light piano music)

54:52.923 --> 54:55.524
- Oh my God, you have so
much mustard on your mouth.

54:55.526 --> 54:57.326
- Oh shit, napkin.

54:59.030 --> 54:59.995
- Here.

55:00.731 --> 55:02.431
- Thank you.

55:02.433 --> 55:04.433
(Claire giggles)

55:04.435 --> 55:06.302
I feel like a tourist
in my own city.

55:06.304 --> 55:09.071
- I know, it is so
gorgeous, though.

55:09.073 --> 55:10.572
- Right?

55:10.574 --> 55:13.709
(light piano music)

55:16.047 --> 55:18.347
When I was a kid, I used to
eat my ice cream really fast.

55:18.349 --> 55:20.138
- Shocker.

55:20.139 --> 55:21.928
- Then I'd convince
my little brother

55:21.929 --> 55:23.718
that he couldn't finish his
before it started to melt.

55:23.721 --> 55:25.854
You should've seen
the look on his face.

55:26.857 --> 55:28.991
He'd hand it over to me.
- You are so mean.

55:29.994 --> 55:31.460
- You're not eating
yours fast enough.

55:31.462 --> 55:33.796
- Stop.
- It's gonna start melting.

55:35.366 --> 55:36.065
- You're gonna get it
all over your hand.

55:36.067 --> 55:37.900
- No I won't.

55:37.901 --> 55:39.734
- You can't finish
it, give it to me.

55:39.737 --> 55:40.602
- Stop it!

55:40.604 --> 55:41.870
(both laugh)

55:41.872 --> 55:43.706
- Let's take a selfie.
- Okay.

55:55.353 --> 55:57.820
- Is there noodle soup
in Korean cuisine?

55:58.789 --> 55:59.788
- Yes.

56:00.891 --> 56:01.924
- How 'bout Thai?

56:03.427 --> 56:05.761
- I'm not sure,
I don't think so.

56:05.763 --> 56:06.762
- Vietnamese?

56:08.032 --> 56:09.665
- What, just because I'm Asian

56:09.667 --> 56:12.501
you think I'm an
expert in noodle soup?

56:12.503 --> 56:14.703
- Yes.

56:14.704 --> 56:16.904
- Vietnamese, definitely, they
have the best noodle soup.

56:16.907 --> 56:17.940
- Japan?

56:17.942 --> 56:23.045
- Oh, Japan, udon
come from Japan.

56:23.047 --> 56:24.480
- All right, all right.

56:27.051 --> 56:28.484
- Claire?
- Yeah?

56:30.654 --> 56:31.653
- Nothing.

56:33.724 --> 56:34.723
What should we do after dinner?

56:36.394 --> 56:37.526
- Let's go dancing.

56:39.430 --> 56:40.429
- No.

56:41.065 --> 56:42.631
(Claire laughs)

56:42.633 --> 56:45.067
(club music)

56:53.077 --> 56:55.611
You're laughing at me.
- I am not laughing at you.

56:55.613 --> 56:58.080
- You're laughing at me!
- Now I am!

56:58.082 --> 57:00.682
(club music)

57:27.445 --> 57:30.112
(Claire laughs)

57:31.549 --> 57:34.450
- To summarize, there are many
challenges and opportunities

57:34.452 --> 57:36.018
in the world of
architecture today

57:36.020 --> 57:38.437
and our creative decisions

57:38.438 --> 57:40.855
will impact not only aesthetics
but also the environment

57:40.858 --> 57:42.891
in which we live, thank you.

57:42.893 --> 57:44.226
(audience applauds)

57:44.228 --> 57:45.861
Are there any questions?

57:46.864 --> 57:49.465
It looks like you
have a question.

57:49.467 --> 57:53.068
- Oh, no, no, no question.

57:53.070 --> 57:55.504
- Okay, well, thanks for coming.

58:13.824 --> 58:16.725
It really did look like
you had a question.

58:16.727 --> 58:19.595
- No, no, I'm a
developer and I agreed

58:19.597 --> 58:21.563
with everything you said.

58:21.565 --> 58:23.031
- Do you want to get a drink?

58:25.536 --> 58:27.503
- Yeah, sure, yeah.

58:29.240 --> 58:32.774
- You, you're an Adonis.

58:32.776 --> 58:34.643
- Sounds like you're teasing me.

58:34.645 --> 58:36.245
- Oh, I am teasing you.
- Yeah.

58:38.716 --> 58:41.683
- You work out, don't you?
- I do my thing.

58:41.685 --> 58:45.053
- Oh, I bet. (laughs)
- Are you all right?

58:45.923 --> 58:48.657
- I'll let you know in an hour.

58:48.659 --> 58:53.795
- Oh, okay, so do you want
to talk about your blueprint?

58:54.532 --> 58:57.766
- Oh, don't be so boring, Derek.

58:57.768 --> 59:00.302
(Derek laughs)

59:01.605 --> 59:03.171
Let's get another.
- Yeah.

59:04.141 --> 59:05.240
- Bartender.

59:08.646 --> 59:11.280
I know just what to do with you.

59:11.282 --> 59:12.782
- Really.
- Yeah.

59:12.783 --> 59:14.283
- And I have to tell
you that I don't like

59:14.285 --> 59:18.987
anything complicated.
- Shh, don't speak.

59:20.291 --> 59:21.290
Don't speak.

1:00:17.815 --> 1:00:19.247
- Totally engaging.

1:00:19.249 --> 1:00:20.882
We spend the rest of
the night drinking

1:00:20.884 --> 1:00:22.684
and this is where I fucked up,

1:00:22.686 --> 1:00:25.954
I invite him back to my
place and crazy mad sex.

1:00:25.956 --> 1:00:28.090
- Simone.
- We did it like three times.

1:00:28.092 --> 1:00:30.859
So he calls me up the
next day and asks me out

1:00:30.861 --> 1:00:32.694
and I want to look
good, you know,

1:00:32.696 --> 1:00:34.963
I have Pauline come over
and she's doing my hair

1:00:34.965 --> 1:00:38.834
for like an hour and a half,
makeup, the whole works.

1:00:38.836 --> 1:00:42.771
(sighs) I get a phone
call at five PM.

1:00:42.773 --> 1:00:45.073
He says "I'm really sorry
but something came up at work

1:00:45.075 --> 1:00:49.144
"and I can't make it," I mean
what the fuck, what the fuck?

1:00:49.146 --> 1:00:51.713
So he says, "Can we
meet tomorrow for lunch

1:00:51.715 --> 1:00:53.882
"or dinner Thursday,"
and I'm like, "I can't,

1:00:53.884 --> 1:00:56.785
"because I am busy" and he
wasn't even that apologetic.

1:00:56.787 --> 1:01:00.322
- Stop, hold on, you had a
one night stand with this guy,

1:01:00.324 --> 1:01:01.657
what do you expect?

1:01:01.658 --> 1:01:02.991
- Yeah, but he was all over me.

1:01:02.992 --> 1:01:04.325
I could tell that
he was into me.

1:01:04.328 --> 1:01:06.294
- I know what this is about.

1:01:06.296 --> 1:01:09.364
- What, I need validation?
- You need to grow up.

1:01:10.968 --> 1:01:12.384
- Just stop it.

1:01:12.385 --> 1:01:13.801
- Why did you break
up with Henrietta?

1:01:13.804 --> 1:01:15.937
- I told you, she was
getting on my nerves.

1:01:15.939 --> 1:01:17.372
- That's just people, man,

1:01:17.374 --> 1:01:19.841
like sometimes
people are annoying.

1:01:20.911 --> 1:01:23.679
- I find some fault and
I just can't let it go.

1:01:23.681 --> 1:01:25.881
I just get fixated
on it, you know?

1:01:25.883 --> 1:01:29.351
- Yeah, the thing is,
you're not perfect.

1:01:29.353 --> 1:01:32.087
- Yes I am, I'm perfect.

1:01:32.823 --> 1:01:33.822
- Okay.

1:01:35.159 --> 1:01:37.025
- So how are things with Claire?

1:01:38.896 --> 1:01:40.729
- Good.
- Oh come on.

1:01:40.731 --> 1:01:41.980
- What?

1:01:41.981 --> 1:01:43.230
- I can tell you're
in love with her.

1:01:44.968 --> 1:01:47.035
See, see?

1:01:47.037 --> 1:01:49.304
You smiled just at the
thought of her name.

1:01:53.143 --> 1:01:56.011
- How long am I supposed to
wait for something to happen?

1:01:56.013 --> 1:01:58.313
I haven't even had an
audition in two months.

1:02:00.117 --> 1:02:01.717
- [Dad] I wish I could tell you.

1:02:02.386 --> 1:02:04.186
- All I do is work at the store.

1:02:07.091 --> 1:02:08.156
- [Dad] Just be patient.

1:02:08.158 --> 1:02:13.295
- Okay, I love you, Dad.
- Love you too, hon.

1:02:14.264 --> 1:02:15.263
- Bye.

1:02:19.236 --> 1:02:22.037
(Claire sighs)

1:02:24.475 --> 1:02:26.408
- Hello?
- Hi, this is Peter.

1:02:26.410 --> 1:02:27.876
Did Tom leave for work?

1:02:27.878 --> 1:02:33.315
Oh, I see, okay, they're
vacating a spot today

1:02:33.317 --> 1:02:35.283
and I wanted to give him a
heads up before he got in.

1:02:35.285 --> 1:02:37.119
Never mind, he's walking in now.

1:02:38.422 --> 1:02:39.888
Shawn wants to see you.

1:03:01.912 --> 1:03:05.247
(cheerful piano music)

1:03:23.967 --> 1:03:26.501
(phone rings)

1:03:29.339 --> 1:03:32.040
- Sharon, hi, I'm well.

1:03:34.077 --> 1:03:37.846
It's slow, really, oh
my God, that's amazing.

1:03:37.848 --> 1:03:39.347
- Who is it?

1:03:39.349 --> 1:03:41.917
- Wow, I had a
good feeling also.

1:03:43.353 --> 1:03:45.220
No, nothing at the moment.

1:03:47.291 --> 1:03:48.924
Really?
- Who is it?

1:03:50.994 --> 1:03:55.831
- I mean, yes, I mean, it would
be a wonderful opportunity.

1:03:57.835 --> 1:03:59.968
Okay, I will, I'll
get back to you.

1:04:01.905 --> 1:04:03.972
Congratulations, bye.

1:04:04.842 --> 1:04:06.608
- Who is that?

1:04:06.610 --> 1:04:08.243
- Sharon, the producer.

1:04:09.880 --> 1:04:12.247
They're offering me a role.
- That's awesome!

1:04:13.250 --> 1:04:15.250
- They found a theater
company in London.

1:04:16.887 --> 1:04:18.386
- London.

1:04:18.388 --> 1:04:20.522
- They're interested
in a year long run.

1:04:24.862 --> 1:04:26.428
It's an amazing
opportunity, I mean,

1:04:26.430 --> 1:04:28.714
the exposure could
be really good for me

1:04:28.715 --> 1:04:30.999
if the show is a success.
- Of course, absolutely.

1:04:33.070 --> 1:04:34.436
- I mean, obviously I
would rather be here,

1:04:34.438 --> 1:04:36.872
but I'm not getting anything.

1:04:36.874 --> 1:04:38.573
- I mean, it takes time.

1:04:38.575 --> 1:04:40.575
- So you don't think
I should take the job.

1:04:40.577 --> 1:04:43.478
- I didn't say that, I
mean, it's your decision.

1:04:43.480 --> 1:04:45.947
- I would like to think
it is our decision.

1:04:51.488 --> 1:04:52.754
- A year's a long time, Claire.

1:04:52.755 --> 1:04:54.021
- We could see each other,
I don't know, twice a month.

1:04:54.022 --> 1:04:55.288
You'd come visit me.

1:04:55.292 --> 1:04:59.294
- Yeah, on the weekends and
Skype the rest of the time

1:04:59.296 --> 1:05:00.896
and have a virtual relationship.

1:05:00.898 --> 1:05:02.230
- So what are you saying?

1:05:03.567 --> 1:05:04.883
- We don't have to
talk about this now.

1:05:04.884 --> 1:05:06.200
- Well, it's too late.

1:05:08.472 --> 1:05:11.439
- Just saying,
let's be realistic.

1:05:11.441 --> 1:05:13.642
- What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

1:05:13.644 --> 1:05:16.077
- We're gonna be an ocean apart.

1:05:17.414 --> 1:05:19.214
- Are you saying that
we can't be together

1:05:19.216 --> 1:05:20.448
if I go to London?

1:05:20.450 --> 1:05:23.585
- It's not up to me.
- Well, who's it up to?

1:05:29.459 --> 1:05:31.493
I just got the best
news of my career

1:05:31.495 --> 1:05:34.213
and I am so sad right now.

1:05:34.214 --> 1:05:36.932
- No one cares about this
for you more than I do.

1:05:38.101 --> 1:05:39.434
- You're acting like a
real jerk, you know that?

1:05:39.436 --> 1:05:41.503
Like you don't give
a fuck about me.

1:05:41.505 --> 1:05:43.605
- I care about you more
than anything in this world

1:05:43.607 --> 1:05:46.241
and if you don't know that, I
don't know what to tell you.

1:05:46.243 --> 1:05:49.945
You have to go, just don't
expect me to like it.

1:05:49.947 --> 1:05:52.247
(light piano music)

1:05:52.249 --> 1:05:53.415
- I won't go, okay?

1:05:54.484 --> 1:05:56.084
I said I won't take the job.

1:05:56.086 --> 1:05:57.703
- You have to go.

1:05:57.704 --> 1:05:59.321
- I'll join Actors Equity
and maybe I can book

1:05:59.323 --> 1:06:00.906
a Broadway gig.

1:06:00.907 --> 1:06:02.490
- Last time I checked, they
don't just hire anybody.

1:06:02.492 --> 1:06:03.591
- What do you know
about theater?

1:06:03.593 --> 1:06:05.660
- I know enough.

1:06:05.662 --> 1:06:07.579
- There's a lot of
TV in New York now.

1:06:07.580 --> 1:06:09.497
I haven't booked any of
it because maybe I didn't,

1:06:09.499 --> 1:06:12.067
I don't know, maybe
I need a TV agent.

1:06:12.069 --> 1:06:13.835
- A TV agent?

1:06:13.836 --> 1:06:15.602
- Yeah, some of them
specialize more in TV

1:06:15.605 --> 1:06:18.173
than film and theater,
work with me here.

1:06:20.510 --> 1:06:21.509
- I love you.

1:06:24.648 --> 1:06:25.647
You have to go.

1:06:27.651 --> 1:06:30.085
And I want to make this work.

1:06:30.087 --> 1:06:33.221
(light piano music)

1:06:42.332 --> 1:06:43.631
(sighs) So what are
we talking about here?

1:06:43.633 --> 1:06:45.700
- Rehearsals start in two weeks.

1:06:47.771 --> 1:06:49.704
- Where would you live?

1:06:49.706 --> 1:06:52.240
- The producers said
they'd find me a studio.

1:06:53.510 --> 1:06:57.479
- I want you to be safe.
- Babe, it's London.

1:06:57.481 --> 1:07:00.032
- It says it's 45
degrees and raining.

1:07:00.033 --> 1:07:02.584
- It's to be expected.
- You're gonna need a raincoat

1:07:03.553 --> 1:07:06.554
- I'll get one.
- Oh, let's get one

1:07:06.556 --> 1:07:08.223
together before you go.

1:07:10.360 --> 1:07:11.359
- Okay.

1:07:13.530 --> 1:07:16.631
- (sighs) I shouldn't have
deleted my Skype account.

1:07:16.633 --> 1:07:19.034
- We'll open new ones together.

1:07:19.036 --> 1:07:20.035
- Yeah.

1:07:21.805 --> 1:07:23.338
I'm gonna miss you, goddammit.

1:07:25.475 --> 1:07:27.342
I'm all right, I'm all right.

1:07:31.381 --> 1:07:36.518
- I'm gonna miss you too.

1:07:41.591 --> 1:07:46.728
What do you think?

1:08:12.222 --> 1:08:14.656
- Another martini
for the birthday boy?

1:08:14.658 --> 1:08:16.091
- Yes please.

1:08:28.672 --> 1:08:31.406
- I won't.
- No, you can't leave again.

1:08:31.408 --> 1:08:34.309
- No, I'm not.
- Okay, well, was it fun?

1:08:35.112 --> 1:08:37.579
- Not without you, I got you.

1:08:39.349 --> 1:08:40.348
- You are so cute.

1:08:40.350 --> 1:08:42.367
- There you go, is
there anything else

1:08:42.368 --> 1:08:44.385
I can get for you
in the meantime?

1:08:44.387 --> 1:08:46.221
- No, this is,

1:08:49.493 --> 1:08:51.326
this is perfect.

1:08:51.328 --> 1:08:53.261
Andreas?
- Yes sir.

1:08:54.664 --> 1:08:56.664
- Are you a family man?
- Yes sir.

1:08:56.666 --> 1:08:58.800
I have a wife and two kids.

1:08:58.802 --> 1:09:00.301
- The gods have blessed you.

1:09:00.303 --> 1:09:01.636
- Thank you, sir.

1:09:05.308 --> 1:09:07.776
- The gods have blessed me too.

1:09:07.777 --> 1:09:10.245
I am successful in my work,
I have amassed great wealth,

1:09:11.414 --> 1:09:14.682
but the gods have not
shown much favor in love.

1:09:15.819 --> 1:09:18.286
- They will, sir,
they will in time.

1:09:20.390 --> 1:09:22.190
- Thank you, Andreas, thank you.

1:09:22.192 --> 1:09:23.525
- [Andreas] You're welcome, sir.

1:09:40.510 --> 1:09:43.511
- When's boarding?
- It's at eight.

1:09:44.948 --> 1:09:46.614
- I'm sorry I can't
take you to the airport.

1:09:46.616 --> 1:09:48.316
- It's okay.

1:09:48.318 --> 1:09:49.367
- The first session's mandatory.

1:09:49.368 --> 1:09:50.417
We all have to show up.

1:09:50.420 --> 1:09:51.653
- Don't worry about it.

1:09:54.257 --> 1:09:55.423
- Did you get an aisle seat?

1:09:55.425 --> 1:09:56.457
- I got a window.

1:09:58.628 --> 1:09:59.727
- Aisle's better, no?

1:09:59.728 --> 1:10:00.827
- I prefer a window.

1:10:04.467 --> 1:10:05.900
- What about your apartment,
how are you gonna get in?

1:10:05.902 --> 1:10:07.468
- The super will be there.

1:10:08.972 --> 1:10:10.288
- Okay.
- Tom.

1:10:10.289 --> 1:10:11.605
- Yeah?
- Don't worry.

1:10:15.345 --> 1:10:16.878
- I don't know how
to say goodbye.

1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:18.479
- It's not goodbye.
- I know.

1:10:21.484 --> 1:10:22.684
- I love you.

1:10:23.620 --> 1:10:25.520
- I love you too.

1:10:25.522 --> 1:10:28.656
(light piano music)

1:11:14.638 --> 1:11:15.536
- Can you pass the salt, please?

1:11:15.538 --> 1:11:16.537
- Oh, sure.

1:11:18.475 --> 1:11:19.474
- Thank you.

1:11:24.414 --> 1:11:25.413
- Aren't you Mario?

1:11:28.585 --> 1:11:29.584
- Yes.

1:11:30.387 --> 1:11:33.371
Have we met?

1:11:33.372 --> 1:11:36.356
- I'm Simone, I was at Tom's
Christmas party last year.

1:11:36.359 --> 1:11:38.026
- Oh, okay.

1:11:39.996 --> 1:11:41.996
I really don't.
- Yeah, you seemed kinda busy.

1:11:41.998 --> 1:11:44.966
- Well, I was probably
laying it on thick

1:11:44.968 --> 1:11:47.335
with some unsuspecting victim.

1:11:48.438 --> 1:11:50.705
- (laughs) It kinda
seemed that way, yeah.

1:11:50.707 --> 1:11:52.907
- But you know what, I
have a completely new

1:11:52.909 --> 1:11:55.310
paradigm on life.

1:11:55.312 --> 1:11:58.580
- Do tell.

1:11:58.581 --> 1:12:01.849
- Let's just say I wasn't
very kind to others or myself.

1:12:04.921 --> 1:12:07.655
- Yeah well, I think
I've got a leg up on you

1:12:07.657 --> 1:12:11.326
in that department.
- Really?

1:12:14.698 --> 1:12:15.514
- Yeah.

1:12:15.515 --> 1:12:16.331
But I'm changing my ways.

1:12:17.334 --> 1:12:21.102
- Cheers to that.
(cheerful piano music)

1:12:22.072 --> 1:12:23.805
- This week, we're going
to be talking about

1:12:23.807 --> 1:12:26.708
the essential elements
of a story structure,

1:12:26.710 --> 1:12:29.010
starting with the
premise, then discussing

1:12:29.012 --> 1:12:32.880
the central conflict and
moral choices of the hero.

1:12:32.882 --> 1:12:37.051
We're going to work from
Anton Chekhov's Uncle Vanya.

1:12:38.888 --> 1:12:41.055
When we talk about premise,
we want to articulate

1:12:41.057 --> 1:12:43.491
in one sentence--

1:12:43.493 --> 1:12:46.027
(phone rings)

1:12:54.804 --> 1:12:56.371
- Hey.

1:12:56.373 --> 1:12:57.638
Hey, I'm here.

1:12:58.575 --> 1:13:00.908
Are you there?
- Yes, I'm here.

1:13:00.910 --> 1:13:03.778
- Do you see me?
- I see you.

1:13:03.780 --> 1:13:06.714
- I don't see you.
- Oh, crap.

1:13:06.716 --> 1:13:07.782
My video's not on.

1:13:09.886 --> 1:13:11.119
- There you are.
- Hi!

1:13:13.490 --> 1:13:14.956
- Hi, sorry I'm so late.

1:13:16.059 --> 1:13:18.793
- That's okay.
- What time is it over there?

1:13:18.795 --> 1:13:21.396
- It's 11:30.
- Oh, it's really late.

1:13:21.398 --> 1:13:23.898
You look good.
- You look good.

1:13:23.900 --> 1:13:26.100
- No, I don't, you
look like a star.

1:13:26.102 --> 1:13:29.070
- You're so sweet.
- I looked into flights.

1:13:29.072 --> 1:13:33.074
- Oh, me too, there's a British
Air leaving JFK Wednesdays

1:13:33.076 --> 1:13:35.109
at nine PM.
- That's the one I looked at

1:13:35.111 --> 1:13:36.978
also, but if I
leave on a Tuesday,

1:13:36.980 --> 1:13:39.714
then we'll have almost
the whole week together.

1:13:39.716 --> 1:13:41.048
- [Claire] Oh, now
you're thinking.

1:13:41.050 --> 1:13:42.850
What do you want to
do when you get here?

1:13:42.852 --> 1:13:44.952
- I don't care.
- You wanna see Big Ben?

1:13:44.954 --> 1:13:47.855
The touristy stuff?
- I don't care

1:13:47.857 --> 1:13:49.791
as long as we're together.

1:13:49.793 --> 1:13:53.094
(cheerful piano music)

1:14:07.110 --> 1:14:08.976
- What do you think?

1:14:12.449 --> 1:14:14.148
Should we try on
a different suit?

1:14:15.919 --> 1:14:16.918
- No.

1:14:18.455 --> 1:14:19.854
This is perfect.

1:14:30.867 --> 1:14:33.468
(Tom sighs)

1:14:39.209 --> 1:14:42.610
(somber piano music)
