18:02.391 --> 18:05.291
Delphine, gather some flowers
for the garden.

18:05.360 --> 18:09.157
We will touch this place up
to a perfect shine.

18:09.226 --> 18:10.813
I will help her.

18:10.882 --> 18:13.230
Be quick, then.

18:24.689 --> 18:28.141
Soon we will be free
of Mother Sabrine

18:28.210 --> 18:30.385
and make our fortune.

18:32.456 --> 18:34.941
Isn't that why you came here?

18:35.010 --> 18:36.943
My village was small.

18:37.012 --> 18:38.945
There was nothing for me there.

18:39.014 --> 18:41.948
And there will be nothing here

18:42.017 --> 18:44.778
unless you make something.

18:44.847 --> 18:47.264
Or else you never
should have made the journey.

18:49.611 --> 18:51.716
Aren't you afraid
of what awaits us?

18:51.785 --> 18:55.479
I won't wait
for anything, Delphine.

18:55.548 --> 18:58.378
I watched my mother
wait her whole life.

18:58.447 --> 19:00.932
She's still there,
in her chair in the kitchen,

19:01.001 --> 19:02.451
looking out at that dirt yard,

19:02.520 --> 19:04.419
watching the chickens
hunt fleas.

19:04.488 --> 19:06.593
Huh?

19:06.662 --> 19:09.251
-You saw Claudette's lot.
-That is Claudette.

19:11.874 --> 19:14.187
It won't be me.

19:17.397 --> 19:19.192
If you put your mind to it,

19:19.261 --> 19:22.264
you can remake yourself here.

19:29.237 --> 19:31.170
TREPAGNY:
Show me clearly

19:31.239 --> 19:34.276
the one you have chosen for me.

19:34.345 --> 19:36.002
Or speak her name,

19:36.071 --> 19:39.143
that I might know her
upon first sight.

19:39.212 --> 19:42.698
A modest woman free of vanity

19:42.767 --> 19:45.770
whose greatest pleasure
is to please.

19:46.633 --> 19:49.084
One with whom I might ascend

19:49.153 --> 19:52.260
on beams of the light.

19:59.301 --> 20:00.992
Very well.

20:10.416 --> 20:14.040
What are you going to town for?

20:14.109 --> 20:16.353
Business, Mari.

20:16.422 --> 20:18.631
I will wait for you.

20:18.700 --> 20:20.322
Do not.

20:20.391 --> 20:23.532
I will stay at the inn tonight.

20:23.601 --> 20:26.984
And when I return
I will sleep here from now on.

20:27.053 --> 20:29.297
Not in your cabin.

20:29.366 --> 20:32.576
It is our cabin.
Your son sleeps there.

20:32.645 --> 20:36.235
Then it will be
made better for the room.

20:38.029 --> 20:39.583
[laughs]
Come.

20:44.691 --> 20:45.968
And one...

20:48.005 --> 20:50.663
And one.

20:50.732 --> 20:53.182
No, no, no, no.
Have you forgotten

20:53.252 --> 20:55.081
everything I taught you?

20:55.150 --> 20:56.841
Again.

20:56.910 --> 21:00.120
[sighs]
I do not want to dance.

21:00.189 --> 21:02.675
Mari, come.

21:02.744 --> 21:04.711
Release me.

21:04.780 --> 21:06.886
Mari.

21:12.236 --> 21:13.479
What have you done?

21:16.447 --> 21:18.829
Clean me up.

21:39.677 --> 21:42.335
I...

21:42.404 --> 21:46.235
I cannot return to our house.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.893
I cannot enter it

21:48.962 --> 21:51.965
without thinking
that you will be there

21:52.034 --> 21:55.141
instead of these trees
that surround.

21:55.210 --> 21:57.039
CHARLES:
Sir?

21:57.108 --> 21:58.869
[grunts softly]

21:58.938 --> 22:01.872
I come in respect for the dead,
sir, and in need of help.

22:01.941 --> 22:03.701
Whose man are you?

22:03.770 --> 22:07.567
Monsieur Trepagny bought my
contract and then released me.

22:07.636 --> 22:10.329
You have run off.

22:12.986 --> 22:14.678
Say it.

22:15.955 --> 22:17.577
Yes, I have.

22:17.646 --> 22:20.787
And now you pester me.
The town is there.

22:20.856 --> 22:24.308
They will arrest you
for desertion

22:24.377 --> 22:27.898
or worse, if that fool Trepagny
demands it.

22:27.967 --> 22:31.695
I need only to make it to the
docks for a boat back to France.

22:31.764 --> 22:34.939
Passage to France requires coin.

22:35.008 --> 22:37.666
You plainly have none.

22:42.326 --> 22:45.605
CHARLES:
Excuse me, sir.

22:45.674 --> 22:48.781
My apologies.
Take this for the grave.

22:48.850 --> 22:52.336
Is there no corner
of this godforsaken land

22:52.405 --> 22:54.890
where I can be met with silence?

22:54.959 --> 22:58.687
You hold forth weeds
and you burble empty words.

22:58.756 --> 23:02.104
You defile my departed's grave
with your idiocy.

23:10.181 --> 23:12.632
Sir, whatever you need done,
I will do.

23:12.701 --> 23:14.634
I've learned much
from my time in the woods.

23:14.703 --> 23:17.292
I can see that.

23:17.361 --> 23:18.638
How many men do you know
who can connive

23:18.707 --> 23:19.984
an Indian out of clothes?

23:20.053 --> 23:21.503
They prepared a feast
in my honor,

23:21.572 --> 23:23.056
I gained knowledge
of their ways.

23:23.125 --> 23:26.888
-Get to your point.
-I can be of service to you.

23:28.096 --> 23:30.098
But how, exactly?

23:45.907 --> 23:48.461
-I would like a word, Mr. Cooke.
-[sighs]

23:49.324 --> 23:50.429
Of course.

23:50.498 --> 23:53.190
Your man, Gus Lafarge.

23:53.259 --> 23:54.536
Aye.
What of him?

23:54.605 --> 23:57.090
Gus and his son
ransacked the innkeeper.

23:57.159 --> 23:59.092
His boy Thom took the girl
that we found

23:59.161 --> 24:00.749
at the creek settlement.

24:00.818 --> 24:03.649
What happened at the inn
was a tragedy,

24:03.718 --> 24:05.927
and Captain Bouchard
will see to it and set it right.

24:05.996 --> 24:07.342
I am sure of it.

24:07.411 --> 24:10.449
The captain is nothing but
a belly full of brandy

24:10.518 --> 24:13.244
and not the man
to set anything right.

24:13.313 --> 24:15.488
Gus Lafarge is dead.

24:15.557 --> 24:18.077
I saw his end myself.

24:19.872 --> 24:23.116
Come in. We shall have
a cup of tea and discuss.

24:28.708 --> 24:30.676
Thank you.

24:30.745 --> 24:32.436
Oh, may I?
My wife used

24:32.505 --> 24:33.506
to prepare this for me
every morning.

24:33.575 --> 24:35.577
She said the honey

24:35.646 --> 24:37.476
for the throat.

24:38.960 --> 24:41.169
And lavender

24:41.238 --> 24:43.482
for the eyes.

24:46.277 --> 24:49.108
I think you'll find it
quite soothing.

24:52.698 --> 24:54.700
It's sufficiently hot.

24:54.769 --> 24:56.874
Do not lie, Mr. Goames.

24:56.943 --> 24:59.221
I can see that it pleases you.

24:59.290 --> 25:00.775
Answers would please me more.

25:00.844 --> 25:02.880
Gus Lafarge is dead.

25:02.949 --> 25:04.572
A good result for you,
I suppose.

25:04.641 --> 25:06.090
He leaves behind a wife and son.

25:06.159 --> 25:08.472
I would hardly call that
a good result.

25:08.541 --> 25:10.301
If he's dead, as you say.

25:10.370 --> 25:11.440
He is.

25:11.510 --> 25:12.545
Where's the boy?

25:12.614 --> 25:14.202
Well, how would I know?

25:14.271 --> 25:16.307
Uh, what happened at the inn
was not of my doing.

25:16.376 --> 25:19.138
This is about the creek massacre
and your hand in it.

25:19.207 --> 25:21.036
The Iroquois were the hand--
they were put down.

25:21.105 --> 25:23.556
The Iroquois are easily
guided to savagery.

25:23.625 --> 25:27.111
Mr. Goames, do not take me

25:27.180 --> 25:30.183
for a Frenchman
who harbors secrets.

25:30.252 --> 25:34.084
Now, you came here to look
for your man Cross?

25:34.153 --> 25:35.154
Yes.

25:35.223 --> 25:36.224
And the Company sent you?

25:36.293 --> 25:38.088
-They did.
-Tell me,

25:38.157 --> 25:41.540
who was it who tasked you
with this mission?

25:42.471 --> 25:44.681
The name doesn't matter.

25:46.717 --> 25:49.824
Though I recently parted
from the Company,

25:49.893 --> 25:52.689
yet I have many friends

25:52.758 --> 25:54.932
in her bloody ranks.

25:56.382 --> 25:59.247
The name matters.

26:00.110 --> 26:02.112
What are you getting at, Cooke?

26:03.251 --> 26:05.149
The Company
did not send you here.

26:05.218 --> 26:07.704
If they had, you would know
that what happened by the creek

26:07.773 --> 26:10.430
was your man Cross' idea.

26:10.499 --> 26:14.158
That's right, the massacre.

26:14.227 --> 26:16.609
The gathering and enticing
of the Iroquois.

26:16.678 --> 26:17.748
I don't believe you.

26:17.817 --> 26:18.784
Pardon me, sir,

26:18.853 --> 26:20.786
but I don't believe you.

26:20.855 --> 26:22.926
The Company did not send you.

26:22.995 --> 26:25.963
You're here for some
other purpose.

26:27.896 --> 26:29.795
And what of it?

26:32.970 --> 26:35.248
Cross is married to my sister.

26:35.317 --> 26:37.319
Father to her son.

26:37.388 --> 26:39.390
His correspondence ended.

26:39.459 --> 26:43.498
So I came here to discover
his whereabouts for my sister.

26:43.567 --> 26:46.708
That is the truth.

26:48.330 --> 26:51.644
And yet...
Cross is a Company man?

26:51.713 --> 26:52.818
To the bone.

26:52.887 --> 26:54.164
Well, as a Company man yourself,

26:54.233 --> 26:56.753
you should know
that it is their aim

26:56.822 --> 26:58.996
to grab land

26:59.065 --> 27:01.516
where they can
create instability.

27:01.585 --> 27:03.345
And then move in,

27:03.414 --> 27:07.418
and take advantage
of that instability.

27:08.799 --> 27:12.285
Your Cross was sent here
to do that.

27:12.354 --> 27:13.632
You lie.

27:13.701 --> 27:15.357
I'm afraid that I do not.

27:15.426 --> 27:18.257
He contacted me and asked me
to partner with him on this.

27:18.326 --> 27:22.226
And, now, I am afraid
I am left for the bill.

27:22.295 --> 27:24.677
So, you see, Mr. Goames,

27:24.746 --> 27:26.610
we are allies of a sort.

27:26.679 --> 27:28.370
We are no such thing.

27:28.439 --> 27:30.269
Where is Cross?

27:30.338 --> 27:33.065
Well, I don't know,
but he's probably dead.

27:33.134 --> 27:35.308
Well, if he is,
you will be held accountable.

27:35.377 --> 27:37.828
And how, exactly,
will I be held accountable?

27:37.897 --> 27:39.347
This is New France.

27:39.416 --> 27:40.866
Where do you think you are?

27:40.935 --> 27:42.384
And what will the French do
when they find out

27:42.453 --> 27:44.628
that a pack of English
are behind this?

27:44.697 --> 27:47.251
Especially ones with ties
to the Hudson Bay Company.

27:47.320 --> 27:50.530
That, to me,
looks like an act of war.

27:50.599 --> 27:53.016
And they will round up and hang

27:53.085 --> 27:56.260
every British civilian
they can find,

27:56.329 --> 28:00.437
including you.

28:00.506 --> 28:03.302
So, let us finish our tea
like good British subjects.

28:03.371 --> 28:05.166
And then, perhaps, you should
leave through the back door,

28:05.235 --> 28:07.168
and not give
that drunkard Bouchard

28:07.237 --> 28:09.135
too many pieces to put together.

28:11.551 --> 28:14.071
[grunting]

28:19.007 --> 28:20.629
What are you doing?

28:20.699 --> 28:22.217
My job.

28:22.286 --> 28:25.393
Trepagny said this plot
is to be cleared, so...

28:25.462 --> 28:26.774
I will clear it.

28:26.843 --> 28:28.292
What for?

28:28.361 --> 28:29.880
A table.

28:29.949 --> 28:31.399
In the sky.

28:32.469 --> 28:35.058
You may ask him about it.

28:35.127 --> 28:37.681
Did he tell you what
his business in town is for?

28:37.750 --> 28:38.855
No.

28:38.924 --> 28:40.684
It is for that woman.

28:40.753 --> 28:41.961
He told you this, I know.

28:42.030 --> 28:43.652
He told me nothing
except to work

28:43.722 --> 28:45.551
and to clear this plot

28:45.620 --> 28:47.173
so he may build his table.

28:47.242 --> 28:48.796
And you do everything he says?

28:48.865 --> 28:51.005
That is my job.

28:53.490 --> 28:55.181
What else?

28:55.250 --> 28:56.769
Nothing.

28:59.392 --> 29:00.497
He's mad.

29:00.566 --> 29:01.636
[chuckles]

29:01.705 --> 29:03.465
Yes.

29:03.534 --> 29:06.158
Yes, perhaps.

29:06.227 --> 29:08.850
He will bring unnatural things
to settle here.

29:08.919 --> 29:12.474
I've seen what he does
to men like you.

29:12.543 --> 29:15.823
You will die in this forest,
Mr. Sel.

29:15.892 --> 29:17.479
Now, tell me.

29:17.548 --> 29:21.380
I have given my word
to serve Monsieur Trepagny,

29:21.449 --> 29:23.451
and I will do so.

29:24.624 --> 29:26.868
Honorably.

29:26.937 --> 29:29.457
And what of me?

29:33.495 --> 29:35.981
Please...

29:37.845 --> 29:39.329
Mari...

29:41.987 --> 29:44.437
let me finish my work in peace.

29:55.828 --> 29:58.003
[indistinct chatter]

30:01.109 --> 30:02.801
THOM:
Mr. Cooke?

30:09.152 --> 30:10.187
Ah.

30:10.256 --> 30:12.776
There you are, my boy.

30:12.845 --> 30:14.743
Uh, in here.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.366
Come.

30:16.435 --> 30:18.402
Sit.

30:18.471 --> 30:19.714
Are you all right?

30:19.783 --> 30:21.060
You all right?

30:21.129 --> 30:22.924
Did anyone see you?

30:22.993 --> 30:25.513
-No, sir.
-Ah.

30:25.582 --> 30:27.135
Is my father here?

30:27.204 --> 30:28.757
No.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.898
No, he... he hasn't returned.

30:30.967 --> 30:33.901
Uh, is something wrong?

30:33.970 --> 30:36.386
I hurt the innkeep's wife.

30:36.455 --> 30:37.697
Stabbed her.

30:37.766 --> 30:39.492
Where is the, um...

30:39.561 --> 30:40.873
that little girl?

30:40.942 --> 30:43.980
Uh, Mr. Trepagny showed up.

30:44.049 --> 30:45.947
And the little girl ran off.

30:46.016 --> 30:47.846
I'm truly sorry, Mr. Cooke.

30:47.915 --> 30:50.918
I suppose my father was just
doing this job for you.

30:50.987 --> 30:52.989
No! No.
