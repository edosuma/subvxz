00:00.438 --> 00:04.290
_

00:05.922 --> 00:08.847
This is Suzy doll.

00:09.070 --> 00:10.960
Heather always had Suzy with her.

00:12.008 --> 00:14.008
I was so happy.
She looked just like me.

00:15.945 --> 00:17.945
That was like her best friend.

00:21.289 --> 00:22.805
Things are getting weird.

00:22.983 --> 00:25.453
Bad things are gonna happen
in this house.

00:28.021 --> 00:29.854
It was making a statement.

00:29.890 --> 00:30.855
"Hello. I'm here."

00:30.891 --> 00:34.592
I cast ye out,
ye noxious vermin.

00:35.829 --> 00:37.829
I hated that doll.

_

00:57.050 --> 00:59.017
Ow!

00:59.052 --> 01:00.318
Whoa.

01:03.454 --> 01:04.787
Back in 1983,

01:04.822 --> 01:08.324
I'd been married for 15 years
to Linda.

01:08.359 --> 01:10.326
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

01:10.361 --> 01:12.261
No. Not yet.
All right?

01:12.296 --> 01:14.697
Mwah.
Soon.

01:16.100 --> 01:18.534
My oldest daughter is Laura.

01:18.569 --> 01:20.169
- Give it to me now!
- No. No.

01:20.204 --> 01:22.738
My middle daughter is Lisa,

01:22.773 --> 01:24.740
and the baby is Heather.

01:25.910 --> 01:28.243
It was Heather's sixth
birthday party,

01:28.279 --> 01:30.946
and we were preparing
for a party for her.

01:32.783 --> 01:37.186
Birthdays are always big
in our family.

01:37.221 --> 01:38.921
Heather was a lot of fun.

01:38.956 --> 01:40.923
She was outgoing,
always playing,

01:40.958 --> 01:42.591
always following me around,

01:42.626 --> 01:45.027
'cause always wants to play with
me 'cause I'm the middle one.

01:45.062 --> 01:48.664
Give it to me!
Now!

01:48.699 --> 01:51.100
Back then,
we didn't have a lot of money,

01:51.135 --> 01:52.801
but we lived hearty,

01:52.837 --> 01:54.503
you know, a lot of fun.

01:58.242 --> 02:00.909
Mom and dad said that grandma
tippy and my aunt Robin

02:00.945 --> 02:02.544
were coming down
from upstate New York

02:02.580 --> 02:04.013
and that my aunt Robin

02:04.048 --> 02:05.748
had something special for me
that she made.

02:05.783 --> 02:08.417
Here it is.

02:08.452 --> 02:12.921
This... is Suzy doll.

02:12.957 --> 02:15.591
And it was this large doll.

02:15.626 --> 02:17.593
And I made her
especially for you.

02:17.628 --> 02:19.495
Thank you.

02:19.530 --> 02:22.064
It was amazing
just how she nailed it

02:22.099 --> 02:23.532
to look exactly like me.

02:26.237 --> 02:28.337
Had the brown hair,
had the pigtails,

02:28.372 --> 02:31.306
and little ribbons
down on the bottom.

02:35.179 --> 02:39.014
It had the big eyes,
rosy cheeks with the smile.

02:39.050 --> 02:41.116
It was a big doll...
Same size as Heather.

02:44.355 --> 02:47.189
It was all about Suzy doll
that day.

02:57.468 --> 03:00.436
Well, it was about
maybe 2:00 in the morning.

03:00.471 --> 03:03.205
We were sleeping,

03:03.240 --> 03:05.808
and all of a sudden,
I just heard this noise.

03:10.314 --> 03:12.481
Gerry.

03:12.516 --> 03:13.582
Gerry, wake up.

03:13.617 --> 03:14.616
What?

03:14.652 --> 03:16.351
Something's down there.

03:16.387 --> 03:18.887
And then I kept hearing this
sound, and it was like a growl,

03:18.923 --> 03:21.323
so I figured it was an animal
in trouble.

03:24.662 --> 03:27.663
I got up,

03:27.698 --> 03:32.468
opened up the window wide.

03:32.503 --> 03:34.837
It's like taking your voice

03:34.872 --> 03:38.140
and just turning it inside out
and just drawing it out.

03:42.313 --> 03:45.214
We could see this shadow

03:45.249 --> 03:47.449
coming up, up the road.

03:53.924 --> 03:57.226
The streetlights
were being cloaked by darkness

03:57.261 --> 03:58.460
one by one.

04:01.832 --> 04:04.566
It just kept getting louder
and louder the closer it got.

04:04.602 --> 04:07.169
My god, Gerry.
What is it?

04:11.242 --> 04:13.275
Hell was coming
down that street.

04:23.087 --> 04:25.787
We had no idea what that was.

04:25.823 --> 04:26.922
Couldn't explain it.

04:35.599 --> 04:37.733
Then all of a sudden,
it was just gone.

04:49.313 --> 04:50.979
It was morning time.

04:51.015 --> 04:54.416
I took Suzy down with me,
sat her on the couch.

04:54.451 --> 04:56.552
Remember being excited
to spend the day with Suzy doll.

04:59.023 --> 05:00.656
- Hey, honey?
- Hey, mom.

05:00.691 --> 05:02.624
Here you go.

05:02.660 --> 05:05.160
I'll be back in five, okay?
Okay.

05:07.965 --> 05:10.399
I put the cereal down
for a quick second

05:10.434 --> 05:12.000
'cause I wanted to get a drink
from my mom.

05:19.176 --> 05:21.009
Mom, can I have a glass
of milk?

05:21.045 --> 05:22.978
Of course.

05:25.149 --> 05:27.416
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

05:31.488 --> 05:34.823
As I'm going back,
I look over to the couch.

05:37.494 --> 05:40.696
She's sitting in the rocking
chair six feet away.

05:40.731 --> 05:43.732
Wow.
I know I didn't put her there.

05:43.767 --> 05:45.968
I was six years old,
so I'm thinking

05:46.003 --> 05:49.137
it was possible that she did
walk from the couch

05:49.173 --> 05:50.539
over to the rocking chair.

05:53.677 --> 05:57.579
It was just gonna be
our little secret.

06:13.364 --> 06:17.266
When I saw Heather,
I always saw Suzy doll with her.

06:17.301 --> 06:19.001
That was like her best friend.

06:23.574 --> 06:26.541
What, Suzy?

06:26.577 --> 06:29.945
She was talking to it
constantly.

06:29.980 --> 06:32.180
It was just the strangest thing.

06:32.216 --> 06:34.082
We're sisters.

06:34.118 --> 06:35.984
There was just something
about that doll

06:36.020 --> 06:39.254
that I can't explain...
I can't explain.

06:53.404 --> 06:55.604
My husband worked nights,

06:55.639 --> 06:59.074
and I worked during the days
in a factory.

06:59.109 --> 07:01.510
I would get up
about 5:30 in the morning.

07:04.982 --> 07:07.416
And I just heard this noise.

07:20.497 --> 07:22.264
I got up.

07:22.299 --> 07:25.267
Now I'm thinking, "are the kids
playing jokes on us?"

07:37.681 --> 07:39.848
I was shocked.

07:47.825 --> 07:51.293
And I was annoyed that it could
be one of the girls doing this.

07:56.734 --> 07:59.868
What the hell's going on here?

07:59.903 --> 08:03.171
I don't know.

08:03.207 --> 08:07.376
Gerry, he thinks that the kids
are horsing around like kids do.

08:09.046 --> 08:11.480
All right, come on.
Everybody get up.

08:11.515 --> 08:12.614
Let's go!

08:12.649 --> 08:15.517
Get up. Get up.
Wake up. Come on.

08:15.552 --> 08:17.018
I was pissed off.

08:17.054 --> 08:19.488
That's it, girls.
I've had enough. Okay?

08:19.523 --> 08:21.390
The milk's left out.
The food's left out.

08:21.425 --> 08:23.925
I said, "what the hell's
going on here?"

08:23.961 --> 08:25.527
I mean, food is money.

08:25.562 --> 08:26.528
- It wasn't...
- Did you do it?

08:26.563 --> 08:27.829
- No.
- Laura, did you do it?

08:27.865 --> 08:29.297
- No! It was you!
- What the hell's going on here?

08:29.333 --> 08:30.499
It was not me.

08:30.534 --> 08:31.767
Why are you always blaming
everything on me?

08:31.802 --> 08:32.833
Lisa,
you're so annoying!

08:32.870 --> 08:34.135
What the hell's going on here,
huh?

08:34.171 --> 08:35.404
Dad, we didn't do it.
What's your problem?

08:35.438 --> 08:36.538
Well, who did it, huh?

08:36.573 --> 08:39.508
We don't know,
but it wasn't us!

08:39.543 --> 08:40.876
We didn't understand

08:40.910 --> 08:45.147
why the girls are being
so disobedient.

08:45.182 --> 08:46.982
- Just tell me.
- No!

08:47.017 --> 08:48.316
Well, what do you mean,
"no"?

08:48.352 --> 08:49.518
How's that happening?

08:49.553 --> 08:51.887
You're looking
for a reasonable explanation

08:51.922 --> 08:53.522
for all this nonsense going on,

08:53.557 --> 08:55.624
and you just can't get it.

09:11.608 --> 09:15.777
Later that day,
my wife was at work.

09:15.813 --> 09:18.847
As soon as I woke up,
I'm hearing this, like, static.

09:21.218 --> 09:24.419
Sounds like the TV.

09:38.268 --> 09:42.237
The whole parlor's just
totally rearranged,

09:42.272 --> 09:44.239
like a tornado
whipped through there

09:44.274 --> 09:45.640
and just threw everything
around.

09:48.312 --> 09:52.380
This is heavy furniture
that we have, very heavy.

09:52.416 --> 09:56.151
I'm thinking to myself,
"it's not the kids."

10:02.025 --> 10:06.127
And Heather is sitting in front
of the TV with static,

10:06.163 --> 10:07.496
just staring at it.

10:12.703 --> 10:16.471
Heather,
what are you doing?

10:16.507 --> 10:18.740
I just got so creeped out.

10:18.775 --> 10:22.477
I was just in shock.
I couldn't believe it.

10:22.513 --> 10:25.180
Heather?

10:25.215 --> 10:26.381
Heather?

10:28.519 --> 10:30.085
Heather!

10:30.120 --> 10:31.853
She's just glaring into this

10:31.889 --> 10:33.922
like she's totally tranced...
Comatose.

10:45.068 --> 10:48.970
It was weird.
It wasn't like her.

10:49.006 --> 10:51.473
You okay, sweetheart?

10:54.378 --> 10:58.446
Every day,
something was happening.

10:58.482 --> 11:02.117
You're asking yourself,
"well, it's not the kids.

11:02.152 --> 11:03.585
You know, what could it be?"

11:13.244 --> 11:17.573
_

11:18.328 --> 11:21.772
_

11:23.414 --> 11:24.947
Gerry suggested

11:24.983 --> 11:27.140
that the only thing
he can come up with...

11:27.240 --> 11:28.806
That somebody has a key,

11:28.841 --> 11:31.242
is breaking in
in the middle of the night,

11:31.277 --> 11:33.177
and doing this.

11:35.748 --> 11:38.649
I proceeded
to change the locks.

11:38.685 --> 11:41.052
Being a husband, a father,

11:41.087 --> 11:43.487
your main duty
is to protect your family.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.845
So it was
the middle of the night...

12:12.852 --> 12:14.118
It sounded like children
playing,

12:14.153 --> 12:16.320
and it sounded like
it was coming from outside.

12:20.526 --> 12:23.060
What's going on here?

12:23.096 --> 12:24.495
It just wasn't normal.

12:27.100 --> 12:28.474
Laura, do you hear that?

12:29.919 --> 12:32.253
Yeah.
I hear that too.

12:32.288 --> 12:35.322
- Go look out the window.
- Why do I have to do it?

12:35.358 --> 12:37.858
'Cause you're older,
and I'm scared.

12:58.347 --> 13:01.749
There's nothing there.

13:04.787 --> 13:07.888
But we still hear
the children... children playing.

13:21.304 --> 13:23.204
I hear a whisper.

13:23.239 --> 13:25.406
Laura, someone's whispering
in my ear.

13:25.441 --> 13:26.740
My ear got cold.

13:26.776 --> 13:28.475
My shoulder got cold
and my neck.

13:28.511 --> 13:31.145
Just go to sleep.

13:33.316 --> 13:35.983
And I could not wait
for morning to come.

13:39.455 --> 13:40.955
I just wanted to run
out of the room,

13:40.990 --> 13:43.123
run down the hall,
wake up my mother.

13:43.159 --> 13:44.892
But I couldn't move.
I was frozen.

13:57.640 --> 14:00.841
So I get up in the morning,

14:00.877 --> 14:02.610
and I notice hair.

14:02.645 --> 14:03.844
There's, like, hair
on my face.

14:03.880 --> 14:05.246
I'm getting it out of my eyes.

14:10.653 --> 14:12.353
Mom. Dad.

14:12.388 --> 14:14.989
Mom, look what's happening
to my hair.

14:18.361 --> 14:22.296
And I looked at her.

14:22.331 --> 14:23.530
Gerry.

14:23.566 --> 14:27.635
It was a perfect circle
in back of her head.

14:27.670 --> 14:29.436
- Are you hurting yourself?
- No.

14:29.472 --> 14:30.971
- Are you pulling out your hair?
- No.

14:31.007 --> 14:33.540
It's okay, sweetheart.

14:36.412 --> 14:39.280
I was so scared.

14:39.315 --> 14:41.181
I had no idea
what was going on with me.

15:07.443 --> 15:08.842
You okay there?
Okay.

15:08.878 --> 15:11.378
So we took her to
the best specialist we could.

15:16.852 --> 15:19.586
We're scared now,
as parents.

15:21.891 --> 15:25.092
For a girl to lose her hair,

15:25.127 --> 15:27.995
it's traumatic.

15:28.030 --> 15:29.964
Now, guys, we're gonna go in
for some tests,

15:29.999 --> 15:33.534
and when I get the results back,
I'll get back to you.

15:33.569 --> 15:35.302
Good luck.
Thank you.

15:35.338 --> 15:37.571
- Take care.
- Thank you.

15:37.606 --> 15:41.675
It's okay, sweetheart.
Okay.

15:51.988 --> 15:53.587
- I'll get the salad.
- Okay.

15:53.622 --> 15:55.089
Almost ready over there?

15:55.124 --> 15:56.924
- Yep.
- All right, I'm starving.

15:56.959 --> 15:59.360
Lisa, dinner.
Come on while it's hot.

15:59.395 --> 16:00.894
Dinner time
was very, very special,

16:00.930 --> 16:04.164
because between my parents
working constantly,

16:04.200 --> 16:07.301
this is the only time we all can
sit down and talk about our day.

16:07.336 --> 16:08.936
Dinner is ready.

16:08.971 --> 16:10.838
Mmm.

16:13.376 --> 16:14.908
How was everyone's day?
Good?

16:14.944 --> 16:15.909
- It was good.
- It was all right.

16:15.945 --> 16:18.278
Yeah?
What did you guys do?

16:18.314 --> 16:21.348
I'm sitting next to Heather,

16:21.384 --> 16:24.084
and out of the blue,
Heather says...

16:24.120 --> 16:27.988
Bad things are gonna happen
in this house.

16:30.593 --> 16:32.593
But her lips didn't move.

16:32.628 --> 16:36.030
What'd she say?

16:36.065 --> 16:38.165
"Bad things are gonna happen
in this house."

16:40.803 --> 16:45.205
It was the creepiest thing
I've ever seen Heather do.

16:49.045 --> 16:50.944
And it sounded
so loud and clear,

16:50.980 --> 16:53.213
like there was a tape recorder
underneath her chair.

17:05.114 --> 17:09.434
_

17:10.130 --> 17:13.877
_

17:14.865 --> 17:16.231
We got the results back.

17:16.266 --> 17:17.465
It looks like
your daughter's hair

17:17.501 --> 17:20.215
was being pulled
out of her head.

17:20.871 --> 17:23.505
Somebody was actually
yanking it out of her head.

17:23.540 --> 17:25.173
Are you kidding me?

17:25.209 --> 17:27.008
How's that even possible?

17:27.044 --> 17:28.877
That's what the test shows.

17:28.912 --> 17:31.546
My mother's face
just went white,

17:31.582 --> 17:36.518
and I was like...
I just couldn't believe it.

17:36.553 --> 17:39.654
I was terrified.

17:39.690 --> 17:42.424
Something in that apartment
was pulling my hair out,

17:42.459 --> 17:44.226
and I didn't feel it.

17:44.261 --> 17:46.228
But it wasn't my family,
and it wasn't me.

17:46.263 --> 17:49.097
Something
was pulling my hair out.

17:59.409 --> 18:03.078
Hey.
You want to come play with me?

18:03.113 --> 18:04.212
Heather was just
acting strange.

18:04.248 --> 18:05.480
She wasn't acting like herself.

18:07.818 --> 18:10.285
Heather always had Suzy
with her.

18:10.320 --> 18:13.188
That's not normal.
It was creepy.

18:13.223 --> 18:14.823
I just didn't like the doll.

18:24.735 --> 18:26.234
With seasonal temperatures.

18:26.270 --> 18:28.570
Clear skies tonight
with a low near 70.

18:28.605 --> 18:29.838
Increasing cloudiness...

18:29.873 --> 18:32.407
One afternoon, I wanted
to get my roller skates.

18:32.442 --> 18:35.510
Nobody else was in the house
except me and my mother.

18:37.814 --> 18:40.815
So I go to enter
me and my sisters' room,

18:40.851 --> 18:44.152
and I stopped,
because I see Suzy doll,

18:44.187 --> 18:47.322
and I just didn't want to go
into the room.

18:50.827 --> 18:53.929
Ma?
You know where my skates are?

18:53.964 --> 18:55.797
Can you help me find them?

19:03.340 --> 19:04.539
And as soon as we walked
back in the room,

19:04.575 --> 19:06.608
I said,
"the doll's gone."

19:06.643 --> 19:08.176
Where'd you put them?

19:08.211 --> 19:11.479
Ma, the doll's gone
off the table.

19:13.650 --> 19:15.784
What do you mean,
"she's gone"?

19:15.819 --> 19:18.853
She was right there,
and now she's not.

19:18.889 --> 19:20.589
Where'd you put her?

19:20.624 --> 19:21.990
I didn't.

19:22.025 --> 19:24.659
We'll find her, okay?

19:27.397 --> 19:29.431
Things are getting weird.

19:29.466 --> 19:33.768
I was freaked out by it.

19:33.804 --> 19:36.204
I heard a noise
coming from the bathroom...

19:42.913 --> 19:44.913
- Mom.
- And there's Suzy.

19:44.948 --> 19:49.451
She's sitting on the toilet,
pants down.

19:49.486 --> 19:52.587
That was so disturbing.

19:52.623 --> 19:54.489
There's no way a doll can walk

19:54.524 --> 19:56.391
from a room to another room

19:56.426 --> 20:00.829
and decide to sit on a toilet.

20:00.864 --> 20:02.664
I was starting to get scared.

20:02.699 --> 20:03.932
I'm already losing my hair.

20:03.967 --> 20:06.267
You know, things are...
We're hearing noises.

20:06.303 --> 20:07.869
Heather's not acting the same.

20:11.608 --> 20:13.141
Go downstairs, honey.

20:13.176 --> 20:14.275
That was it for me.

20:14.311 --> 20:18.046
That was my boiling point
with the doll.

20:18.081 --> 20:22.283
And I'm thinking it's somebody
just playing a joke on us

20:22.319 --> 20:24.319
or the kids are moving things
around... I don't know.

20:42.372 --> 20:44.305
One day,
I was sleeping,

20:44.341 --> 20:46.274
and nobody's in the house.

21:09.466 --> 21:10.865
As soon as I opened my eyes,

21:10.901 --> 21:12.600
and I said,
"what the hell is this?"

21:19.009 --> 21:21.576
It was noise.
It was a lot of noise.

21:26.683 --> 21:30.785
And I'm getting that sick,
scared feeling.

21:59.149 --> 22:01.216
All the cabinets were open.
The drawers were open.

22:01.251 --> 22:03.785
The contents strewn
all over the floor.

22:15.265 --> 22:16.965
And I just froze.

22:17.000 --> 22:21.102
I looked; I couldn't believe
what I was seeing here.

22:21.138 --> 22:24.739
The fronts were sitting on top
of the table,

22:24.775 --> 22:28.610
but the rear legs were just
hanging off in midair.

22:39.756 --> 22:43.458
I'm taking it off.
No resistance.

22:46.129 --> 22:48.563
It's defying gravity.

22:48.598 --> 22:49.564
That just don't happen.

22:49.599 --> 22:51.099
It's physically impossible.

22:54.471 --> 22:57.772
Up until this point,
I was a true nonbeliever

22:57.808 --> 23:00.675
of this hocus-pocus crap.

23:00.710 --> 23:03.278
I got proven wrong.

23:11.267 --> 23:16.472
_

23:17.319 --> 23:18.919
Hey.

23:18.954 --> 23:23.023
Gerry picked me up at work.

23:23.378 --> 23:25.411
You okay?

23:25.446 --> 23:26.712
I said, "look."

23:26.748 --> 23:28.014
I said,
"I know how tight it is,"

23:28.049 --> 23:29.582
but I says,
"we got a problem."

23:29.617 --> 23:32.752
I, uh...
I walked into the kitchen,

23:32.787 --> 23:36.555
and the chairs were, like,
above the table,

23:36.591 --> 23:38.024
like midair.

23:38.059 --> 23:40.960
Gerry, the kids
are playing a joke on you.

23:40.995 --> 23:43.496
No.
No, no, they're not.

23:43.531 --> 23:44.864
It's not the kids.

23:44.899 --> 23:46.665
This is something else.

23:46.701 --> 23:49.101
This is something, like,
out of this world almost,

23:49.137 --> 23:51.137
like something supernatural.

23:51.172 --> 23:53.372
Because I didn't see it,

23:53.408 --> 23:55.374
I didn't believe it.

23:55.410 --> 23:57.843
And he started talking about it,
and I still didn't believe it.

24:01.649 --> 24:04.817
I had no proof, so therefore,
I had to wait.

24:04.852 --> 24:06.752
All right. That's great.

24:06.788 --> 24:10.289
And sure enough,
her day came.

24:20.268 --> 24:23.235
Next day,
it's about lunchtime,

24:23.271 --> 24:25.104
and the kids were in school.

24:25.139 --> 24:26.572
Gerry was out.

24:26.607 --> 24:28.607
Suzy was on the couch,

24:28.643 --> 24:31.844
so I decided to put her
in the rocking chair.

24:56.704 --> 24:58.971
I sat down to have lunch.

25:25.366 --> 25:28.434
I see this marble
going down the hallway.

25:31.005 --> 25:34.740
Here comes another marble
out of the kids' room.

25:37.445 --> 25:40.112
So now I think
there's somebody in the house,

25:40.148 --> 25:43.282
an intruder in my home.

25:48.489 --> 25:49.588
Now I'm scared.

25:49.624 --> 25:52.458
I'm by myself,
and I'm scared.

26:25.526 --> 26:27.960
When I went in the kids' room,

26:27.995 --> 26:29.195
I was just petrified.

26:51.919 --> 26:55.588
And I was scared to put my hand
on the handle.

27:03.898 --> 27:05.497
There was nobody there.

27:12.974 --> 27:15.774
I just don't understand this.

27:24.518 --> 27:26.185
So I went down the hallway.

27:32.493 --> 27:36.295
Then I go into the living room,
and the first thing I saw

27:36.330 --> 27:39.698
was the marbles.

27:39.734 --> 27:42.201
It was just like if somebody
just placed them

27:42.236 --> 27:44.970
right in the middle
of the floor there.

27:59.987 --> 28:01.687
The doll's gone.

28:01.722 --> 28:03.088
It just, like, disappeared.

28:07.962 --> 28:10.162
Felt like my heart
was outside of my chest.

28:29.984 --> 28:33.952
I was totally freaked out.

28:33.988 --> 28:36.021
That's when it clicked in.

28:36.057 --> 28:37.356
There's something wrong.

28:37.391 --> 28:39.992
There's something wrong,
and it isn't the kids.

28:43.531 --> 28:46.699
Honey?

28:46.734 --> 28:48.500
Honey?

28:48.536 --> 28:50.869
We do have a problem.

28:50.905 --> 28:53.472
Whatever it is,
this is supernatural, obviously.

28:53.507 --> 28:57.042
It's okay.

28:57.078 --> 28:58.744
We didn't tell the kids
half the stuff

28:58.779 --> 29:03.148
'cause we were trying
to protect them.

29:03.184 --> 29:05.918
We're desperate by now.

29:05.953 --> 29:07.186
There's something here.

29:11.092 --> 29:13.058
During all these problems
we were having,

29:13.094 --> 29:16.729
we were just strapped...
Drained financially.

29:23.003 --> 29:25.170
So we couldn't move
because of this reason.

29:25.206 --> 29:28.607
You know, so, I mean,
we had no choice but to stay.

29:32.813 --> 29:34.780
I went to lay down on my bed.

29:44.892 --> 29:48.060
Something hit me on my side
right here.

29:51.031 --> 29:53.966
My arm was burning like hell.

30:02.676 --> 30:06.412
I looked up.

30:06.447 --> 30:11.383
On the end of the bed
is the spindles.

30:11.419 --> 30:14.753
They went up.
They spun around.

30:14.789 --> 30:16.355
And they just pointed
straight down.

30:20.628 --> 30:22.995
We had a Major problem going on.

30:23.030 --> 30:24.596
Linda!

30:25.966 --> 30:27.933
Linda!

30:32.273 --> 30:33.439
Go.

30:37.511 --> 30:38.977
There were these claw marks

30:39.013 --> 30:41.213
from the top of his shoulder
all the way down,

30:41.248 --> 30:42.514
and there was four of them,
deep,

30:42.550 --> 30:44.616
and they were so red.

30:44.652 --> 30:46.752
- You got to go.
- Towel. Towel. Now.

30:46.787 --> 30:49.154
Get out of here.

30:49.190 --> 30:50.823
Get your sister.
Get your sister and get out!

30:50.858 --> 30:53.025
- Go! Get them out of here!
- You too. Go!

30:53.060 --> 30:55.027
Now I'm scared.

30:55.062 --> 30:58.197
Whatever this thing is
was getting violent.

30:58.232 --> 31:00.432
But we had no idea
what that was.

31:11.775 --> 31:14.623
_

31:14.835 --> 31:16.751
Gerry.

31:17.771 --> 31:20.157
- Yeah?
- What are we gonna do?

31:20.636 --> 31:22.402
I mean,
who are we gonna call?

31:22.437 --> 31:24.537
We needed help now,

31:24.573 --> 31:26.261
because now it's getting
physical,

31:27.175 --> 31:30.243
and it's gonna hurt somebody,
maybe permanently.

31:30.278 --> 31:32.846
I'll call father Lewis.

31:32.881 --> 31:35.148
Yeah.

31:35.183 --> 31:36.616
Okay.

31:36.652 --> 31:39.085
We called my reverend,

31:39.121 --> 31:43.690
and he suggested that we see
this paranormal investigator.

31:43.725 --> 31:46.760
So we had to call
Lorraine Warren.

31:52.167 --> 31:55.268
I remember the name,
'cause I've seen 'em on TV.

32:01.343 --> 32:03.643
As soon as she walked in,
she's just like...

32:03.679 --> 32:05.712
There's something here.

32:09.084 --> 32:11.518
I'm gonna need you to get
everybody around the table.

32:11.553 --> 32:15.188
Okay.
Kids, come on.

32:15.223 --> 32:18.058
She insists that we all had
to be in the room together,

32:18.093 --> 32:20.560
but Heather was in bed.

32:23.298 --> 32:26.332
Okay, I want everybody
to hold hands.

32:26.368 --> 32:28.301
Okay, grab my hand.

32:39.681 --> 32:41.614
You hear that?

32:58.834 --> 32:59.999
I got a touch.

33:00.035 --> 33:02.001
My ear went cold.

33:08.009 --> 33:11.644
Then suddenly, a strong wind
went in, like, a circle.

33:15.450 --> 33:17.117
Get out of here!

33:17.152 --> 33:19.152
Get out of here!

33:19.187 --> 33:23.123
And then we heard Heather
starting to speak.

33:23.158 --> 33:24.991
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

33:25.026 --> 33:27.093
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

33:27.129 --> 33:28.128
Get out of here!

33:28.163 --> 33:30.029
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

33:31.900 --> 33:33.566
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

33:33.602 --> 33:36.069
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

33:36.104 --> 33:37.670
Get out of here!

33:37.706 --> 33:38.972
Get out of here!

33:39.007 --> 33:40.740
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

33:40.776 --> 33:41.941
Get out of here!

33:41.977 --> 33:44.110
Linda threw Holy water
on Heather.

33:44.146 --> 33:45.879
Get the out of here!

33:45.914 --> 33:47.914
Get the
out of here!

33:47.949 --> 33:50.350
The words that were coming out
her mouth were so vile.

33:50.385 --> 33:52.652
Get the out of here!

33:54.656 --> 33:56.489
It was an older voice.

33:56.525 --> 33:57.991
This was not Heather at all.

34:00.862 --> 34:02.529
I was horrified.

34:02.564 --> 34:05.365
You see your daughter this way,
six-year-old...

34:05.400 --> 34:06.699
It's just not right.

34:06.735 --> 34:08.434
What the hell's going on here?

34:08.469 --> 34:10.170
Is she possessed?

34:10.205 --> 34:12.906
Is my daughter possessed?

34:12.940 --> 34:14.107
No.

34:14.141 --> 34:15.708
Not yet,

34:15.744 --> 34:18.710
but it's working on it.

34:18.746 --> 34:20.847
Die!

34:20.882 --> 34:24.717
I was six years old.
I didn't know what was going on.

34:24.753 --> 34:26.652
I don't remember
'cause I was so young.

34:29.491 --> 34:31.324
But I think you need
an exorcism.

34:31.359 --> 34:32.592
What?

34:37.465 --> 34:40.065
So she wanted me
to meet with father McKenna.

34:40.101 --> 34:42.202
He's done exorcisms before.

34:44.572 --> 34:47.005
We thought this
was about the last chance.

35:08.530 --> 35:11.497
Father McKenna came
with another priest.

35:22.911 --> 35:27.213
We all set up chairs
in the back in a row... two rows.

35:30.018 --> 35:31.684
We were facing father McKenna,

35:31.720 --> 35:33.286
but the whole apartment
was behind us.

35:36.825 --> 35:38.091
Father McKenna said...

35:38.126 --> 35:39.926
Do not look back.

35:39.961 --> 35:41.594
Look straight ahead.

35:43.899 --> 35:48.468
No matter what happens,
do not look back.

35:50.639 --> 35:53.172
Heather didn't act up
during the exorcism.

35:53.208 --> 35:56.142
Maybe it was because
with father McKenna there,

35:56.177 --> 35:58.311
it couldn't get to her.

35:58.346 --> 35:59.746
In the name of the father,
the son,

35:59.781 --> 36:01.714
and the Holy spirit,
amen.

36:01.750 --> 36:06.085
Lord, give me the strength
to protect this family.

36:06.121 --> 36:09.622
I was scared because I didn't
know what was gonna happen.

36:09.658 --> 36:11.291
This is a priest in our home.

36:11.326 --> 36:14.294
This is gonna get ugly.

36:14.329 --> 36:17.764
As I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

36:17.799 --> 36:22.568
I will fear no evil,
for you are with me, Lord.

36:22.604 --> 36:26.372
He wasn't no more
than a minute into this...

36:26.408 --> 36:28.875
Less...
Seconds into this.

36:34.549 --> 36:37.116
Strike terror into the beast.

36:41.623 --> 36:43.723
All of a sudden,
we could hear this scratching,

36:43.758 --> 36:46.025
scratching,
scratching on the wall.

36:49.965 --> 36:52.265
With one wave
of your mighty hand,

36:52.300 --> 36:54.701
remove this evil
from this family.

36:57.505 --> 36:59.172
We heard this growl.

36:59.207 --> 37:03.409
And allow them to be
no longer held captive.

37:03.445 --> 37:06.012
That was the same growl
that we heard outside

37:06.047 --> 37:08.281
that we could never explain
months ago.

37:10.018 --> 37:13.052
Whatever was out there
that night got in.

37:16.291 --> 37:18.458
And the growling's
getting closer,

37:18.493 --> 37:21.861
like it's making its way down
from our room to the hallway.

37:22.998 --> 37:26.065
Strike terror into the beast.

37:28.103 --> 37:30.303
Holy hell
started breaking loose.

37:34.042 --> 37:36.109
The windows were closed

37:36.144 --> 37:37.944
and the curtains
were just blowing everywhere

37:37.979 --> 37:40.213
like there was 50-,
60-mile-per-hour winds.

37:42.150 --> 37:45.184
I cast ye out,
ye noxious vermin.

37:52.260 --> 37:54.160
It sounds like
it's right at the doorway.

37:54.195 --> 37:55.428
It sounds mad.

37:55.463 --> 37:57.430
It does not want the priest
in here.

38:00.168 --> 38:02.735
This is gonna get us.
It's gonna get us now.

38:14.242 --> 38:18.341
_

38:18.671 --> 38:20.938
I look up.

38:20.973 --> 38:24.275
One of the wooden crucifix
turned upside down,

38:24.309 --> 38:25.708
like someone was moving it.

38:27.579 --> 38:28.645
It was horrific.

38:28.680 --> 38:30.513
It was so scary,
we could not move.

38:30.549 --> 38:33.183
Through Christ our Lord
who will come and judge

38:33.218 --> 38:36.119
the living and the dead
and the world by fire.

38:39.057 --> 38:42.158
When I saw Suzy doll
sitting there, that was it.

38:42.194 --> 38:46.362
I realized for everything
that was going on,

38:46.398 --> 38:50.266
the doll was always there.

38:50.302 --> 38:52.068
And that's when I know
for a fact

38:52.103 --> 38:53.536
it was the doll all along.

38:55.841 --> 38:59.342
I know that Suzy doll
came to life in my apartment.

39:00.745 --> 39:02.479
In the name of the Father,
the Son,

39:02.514 --> 39:05.181
the Holy Spirit, amen.

39:05.217 --> 39:06.683
Amen!

39:11.823 --> 39:14.491
The priest told us
to go outside now,

39:14.526 --> 39:16.326
because they're gonna finish,

39:16.361 --> 39:17.927
and they need to finish alone.

39:20.098 --> 39:21.698
Come on.

39:21.733 --> 39:23.700
We left the apartment.

39:23.735 --> 39:26.302
Okay.

39:26.338 --> 39:28.271
Our Father who art in heaven...

39:28.306 --> 39:31.608
We left him up there,
and we kept praying downstairs.

39:31.643 --> 39:34.844
I just pray that you protect
this family with the full armor,

39:34.880 --> 39:36.045
the helmet of salvation,

39:36.081 --> 39:37.280
the breastplate
of righteousness,

39:37.315 --> 39:38.314
the shield of the faith,

39:38.350 --> 39:39.616
the feet for the gospel
of peace,

39:39.651 --> 39:41.518
and the sword
for the word of the Spirit.

39:50.562 --> 39:52.595
All of a sudden,
the sound stopped.

39:52.631 --> 39:55.131
Everything stopped.

39:55.166 --> 39:57.233
Just pray that you protect
this family with the full armor,

39:57.269 --> 39:58.234
the helmet of salvation,

39:58.270 --> 39:59.602
the breastplate
of righteousness,

39:59.638 --> 40:01.104
the shield of faith,

40:01.139 --> 40:02.505
the feet for the gospel
of peace.

40:02.541 --> 40:04.974
The look that I got
from the priest

40:05.010 --> 40:06.743
says, "everything's gonna be
good now."

40:06.778 --> 40:11.548
Come on. Come on, sweetheart.
Come on.

40:11.583 --> 40:13.016
After that, I decided
to get out of the house

40:13.051 --> 40:16.386
for a couple days.

40:19.257 --> 40:20.423
Linda!

40:20.458 --> 40:22.692
What are you doing?

40:22.727 --> 40:24.127
Then all of a sudden,

40:24.162 --> 40:26.229
I heard the rocking chair
in the living room.

40:27.465 --> 40:31.534
I realized the exorcism
didn't work,

40:31.570 --> 40:35.905
so I decided I was gonna get rid
of Suzy right then and there.

40:48.320 --> 40:51.955
And I threw her in the dumpster.

40:51.990 --> 40:53.389
I was very scared,

40:53.425 --> 40:56.859
but I just couldn't have
this doll in the house anymore.

40:56.895 --> 40:59.028
Mom!
Mom, stop!

41:00.532 --> 41:03.666
It was something terrible
and evil about this doll.

41:05.837 --> 41:09.238
Heather was crying,
but I had no choice.

41:09.274 --> 41:11.474
I did not want this doll
anywhere near my children

41:11.509 --> 41:12.508
anymore.

41:28.860 --> 41:30.927
Later that week,

41:30.962 --> 41:33.496
I saw the garbage truck
out the window,

41:33.531 --> 41:35.431
and I knew
the doll was in there.

41:49.414 --> 41:51.781
And I said, "thank god
the doll is gone."

42:04.429 --> 42:06.829
After Suzy doll, I never
owned another doll again.

42:06.865 --> 42:07.930
Never.

42:12.537 --> 42:14.437
I was happy the doll was gone.

42:14.472 --> 42:15.772
I never looked at the doll
anyway.

42:15.807 --> 42:17.140
I couldn't stand it.

42:17.175 --> 42:19.208
Creeped me out and I...
I wanted it out of the house.

42:38.363 --> 42:40.797
I often wonder
where Suzy is now.

42:51.543 --> 42:54.177
You're gonna be
my new best friend.

42:54.212 --> 42:57.380
Mommy! Mommy!
Look what I found.
