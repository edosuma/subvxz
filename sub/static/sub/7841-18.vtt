"Any Given Sundance"

00:30.790 --> 00:32.794
Why do we have to
get here so early?

00:32.795 --> 00:34.780
The football game
doesn't start for hours.

00:35.393 --> 00:37.724
We're not here for the game.

00:37.725 --> 00:40.049
The game is nothing.
The game is crap.

00:40.050 --> 00:41.617
The game makes me sick!

00:41.618 --> 00:44.378
The real reason we Americans
put up with sports is for this:

00:44.827 --> 00:49.607
Behold the tailgate party,
the pinnacle of human achievement!

00:49.640 --> 00:53.204
Since the dawn of parking lots,
man has sought to stuff his guts

00:53.205 --> 00:57.193
with food and alcohol in anticipation
of watching others exercise.

00:57.348 --> 01:00.728
What child birth is to women,
eating trunk meats

01:00.729 --> 01:02.503
is to the bewanged.

01:06.124 --> 01:09.345
What could be greater than
eating and drinking for hours

01:09.346 --> 01:11.336
in a drizzly parking lot?

01:11.337 --> 01:13.715
- Anything.
- No. Everything is better.

01:13.716 --> 01:15.111
- Anything!
- Everything!

01:15.112 --> 01:16.554
- Anything!
- Everything!

01:16.555 --> 01:17.892
- Anything!
- Everything!

01:17.893 --> 01:19.113
- Anything!
- Everything!

01:19.114 --> 01:20.230
- Anything!
- Everything!

01:20.231 --> 01:22.435
Daddy, I made
a Ralphwich!

01:24.013 --> 01:25.478
It tastes hurty!

01:25.479 --> 01:28.203
That's 'cause its' not food, ralphy.

01:28.932 --> 01:31.547
No, no, no. I'm sorry.
It's food. It's food.

01:31.548 --> 01:33.560
Everything's
what you say it is.

01:36.067 --> 01:37.269
All right.

01:37.270 --> 01:40.096
Time to dig in.
I brought everything we need.

01:40.171 --> 01:42.021
It's just forks and plates.

01:42.022 --> 01:45.124
- Didn't we bring any food?
- The food is all around us!

01:45.125 --> 01:46.896
You brought us here to beg?

01:47.861 --> 01:51.354
When you know the people
you're begging from, it's mooching.

01:52.892 --> 01:56.588
Moleman! Come here,
ya big bag o' skin!

01:56.589 --> 01:58.734
How the hell are ya, huh?

02:01.544 --> 02:02.829
No kidding!

02:03.523 --> 02:05.954
Well, that sounds like
you're going to have fun.

02:08.773 --> 02:10.773
Springfield U sucks!

02:10.774 --> 02:13.953
A&M cheerleaders are clumsy!

02:13.954 --> 02:17.886
Your superstar professors treat
undergrads like an afterthought!

02:17.887 --> 02:21.438
Your tenure track
is heavily politicized!

02:21.439 --> 02:22.807
Oh, that's it!

02:24.972 --> 02:27.291
Lisa, honey, just
because you're a girl

02:27.292 --> 02:29.280
doesn't mean you can't
join in the fun.

02:29.281 --> 02:32.124
Maggie and I are washing
the soiled foam fingers.

02:34.818 --> 02:38.086
Well, I guess I could cut loose
and do a little homework.

02:38.087 --> 02:40.865
I can start working
on my school video project.

02:41.293 --> 02:44.232
The assignment is to film
the beauty of the everyday.

02:44.235 --> 02:45.493
So let's see.

03:09.270 --> 03:12.397
There's drama and inspiration
everywhere I look.

03:16.624 --> 03:18.630
I am a born film maker!

03:24.989 --> 03:27.026
Really
interesting stuff.

03:27.027 --> 03:29.138
Three points out
of a possible five.

03:29.839 --> 03:32.468
Ah, that's a funny joke,
Mr. Kincaid.

03:32.469 --> 03:35.194
Is this an art class
or a comedy class?

03:36.431 --> 03:38.916
- I can make it a two.
- Three it is!

03:38.934 --> 03:41.901
You're the teacher,
and I accept your decision.

03:41.902 --> 03:43.911
The man is an idiot!

03:43.912 --> 03:47.187
Agreed. The film has everything:
emotion, conflict, Milhouse.

03:47.712 --> 03:49.721
Lisa, you're a gifted film maker.

03:49.722 --> 03:52.637
It's as if Ingmar Bergman
and Penny Marshall had a baby.

03:52.638 --> 03:55.877
Principal Skinner, I didn't know
you knew so much about film.

03:56.623 --> 03:58.896
Cinema is my secret passion.

03:58.897 --> 04:02.683
I've even written a screenplay
or two on speculation.

04:03.351 --> 04:05.633
When Edna Met Seymour,
Ghost Willie,

04:05.710 --> 04:08.852
Killing Seymour's Mother,
The Principal Who Sold a Screenplay.

04:08.853 --> 04:11.636
They sound great.
I'd love to read them sometime.

04:11.637 --> 04:13.885
Unfortunately, the studios
have made it clear

04:13.886 --> 04:15.811
they're not interested
in my work.

04:15.863 --> 04:19.177
In fact, I'm... I'm no longer welcome
on the Universal Studios tour.

04:19.190 --> 04:21.132
Orlando or Hollywood?

04:21.134 --> 04:22.777
There's one in Hollywood?!

04:22.835 --> 04:25.568
- Yeah, getting back to my grade
- Forget grades!

04:25.569 --> 04:27.932
With the right subject,
you could be a great filmmaker.

04:27.933 --> 04:30.728
What comes to mind
when you think of drama?

04:30.729 --> 04:34.647
Well, according to Aristotle,
drama contains six elements:

04:34.648 --> 04:38.109
- plot, theme, character....
- Not the smarty-pants answer.

04:38.110 --> 04:39.968
Where's the drama in your life?

04:39.969 --> 04:42.358
Okay, but can I just finish
the smarty-pants answer?

04:42.359 --> 04:44.568
- No! In your life!
- My family!

04:44.569 --> 04:46.367
Language, rhythm
and spectacle.

04:46.368 --> 04:48.454
Family, eh? That's right!

04:48.534 --> 04:51.654
Your brother is Bart Simpson,
one of Mrs. Krabappel's

04:51.655 --> 04:55.053
fourth graders, and your father is
a local character of note.

04:56.965 --> 05:00.825
Lisa, if you make a documentary
about your family, I can help you.

05:00.870 --> 05:05.009
I'm giving you the key
to the AV cage.

05:08.982 --> 05:10.888
This is so generous.

05:10.889 --> 05:12.765
How can I ever repay you?

05:12.766 --> 05:15.760
All I ask is,
if you ever win an Oscar...

05:15.766 --> 05:17.134
give it to me.

05:17.135 --> 05:18.760
Um, okay.

05:21.690 --> 05:24.806
Those cabinetmakers laughed at me,
but they'll see.

05:27.036 --> 05:28.754
Lisa, what are you doing?

05:28.755 --> 05:31.950
I'm making a documentary
about a very special family.

05:31.951 --> 05:34.107
- Smithers and Burns?
- No. Us!

05:34.108 --> 05:35.804
- Can I be Smithers?
- No, Dad,

05:35.805 --> 05:37.796
I want you to play
Homer Simpson.

05:37.797 --> 05:39.611
Why, 'cause I'm fat?

05:39.753 --> 05:42.147
I love documentaries!

05:42.230 --> 05:44.712
Especially the one
that came with our lawnmower.

05:44.870 --> 05:48.304
Although it was suspiciously
pro-lawnmower.

05:48.305 --> 05:50.334
Okay, everyone,
just be yourself.

05:50.335 --> 05:52.804
Don't look in the camera.
Pretend I'm not here and...

05:53.145 --> 05:55.247
no toupees.

05:55.248 --> 05:57.630
What, I'm going
for a Shia LaBeouf thing.

05:57.631 --> 05:59.716
Not quite a nerd,
not quite a hunk...

05:59.717 --> 06:01.144
Shia LaBeouf!

06:02.560 --> 06:04.391
And let's roll.

06:04.392 --> 06:07.660
Uh-oh, there's already
an on-set romance.

06:09.847 --> 06:13.105
Homie, she's not
making a snuggle film.

06:13.700 --> 06:16.292
Ew, Lisa,
make them stop!

06:16.804 --> 06:19.959
I'm sorry, but as a filmmaker,
I have to face the truth.

06:20.101 --> 06:22.561
I turn my camera on

06:22.562 --> 06:26.071
I cut my fingers on the way

06:26.495 --> 06:28.016
On the way

06:28.017 --> 06:30.317
The way I'm slipping away

06:30.364 --> 06:32.182
I turn my turn my feelings off

06:32.183 --> 06:35.130
You made me untouchable for life

06:38.087 --> 06:40.128
And you wasn't polite

06:42.922 --> 06:45.081
It hit me like a tom

06:47.551 --> 06:49.902
You hit me like a tom

06:52.466 --> 06:54.635
No-no, no

07:02.255 --> 07:04.743
- Skinner!
- Yes, Superintendent Chalmers?

07:04.744 --> 07:08.287
I hear you've been encouraging
a student's creativity!

07:08.288 --> 07:10.796
- Please, sir, I can explain...
- I'm thrilled!

07:10.815 --> 07:13.810
Or would have been, if not
for your knee-jerk assumption

07:13.811 --> 07:16.525
that I'm angry at you,
which I am now.

07:16.575 --> 07:19.223
Anyway, we have got
to support Lisa Simpson's film.

07:19.224 --> 07:21.154
This is our chance to finally show up

07:21.155 --> 07:24.067
that fancy Springfield Creative
Arts Academy.

07:27.406 --> 07:29.960
The whole school
is made up of modeling clay.

07:29.961 --> 07:32.971
Every afternoon, they reshape it
just to get my goat.

07:36.826 --> 07:38.788
Well, with some school band

07:38.789 --> 07:41.990
music and added effects, we could
show Lisa's film at the public library.

07:41.991 --> 07:44.081
Think bigger, Seymour.

07:44.082 --> 07:45.997
Think film festivals.

07:45.998 --> 07:47.213
You mean...

07:47.291 --> 07:48.370
Banff?

07:48.371 --> 07:51.677
Banff, Shmanff.
I'm talking about Sundance!

07:51.678 --> 07:52.886
Sundance?!

07:52.887 --> 07:55.584
The preeminent
independent film festival

07:55.585 --> 07:58.325
held each January
in Park City, Utah?

07:58.326 --> 08:00.251
Yes, the very same, yes.

08:00.252 --> 08:03.292
If Lisa's movie gets in,
we won't just be the school

08:03.293 --> 08:05.828
with the highest
hamster mortality rate.

08:05.829 --> 08:07.151
Ah, so young.

08:07.152 --> 08:09.405
We'll also have a kid
who did a thing.

08:12.721 --> 08:15.298
I call this cue
"Homer's Lament."

08:22.652 --> 08:25.866
What are you boys
doing on the Foley stage?

08:25.867 --> 08:28.627
Awesome-ing up
your sound effects.

08:28.628 --> 08:30.407
Okay, one more take.

08:30.903 --> 08:33.711
Can we please
go to the next scene?

08:36.129 --> 08:37.363
Oh, dear.

08:37.364 --> 08:39.408
We're getting too many
mainstream movies.

08:39.409 --> 08:41.192
When are we going
to see a submission

08:41.234 --> 08:44.455
with the Sundance
independent film spirit?

08:44.913 --> 08:46.226
"Paul Giamatti...

08:46.960 --> 08:49.815
"is the world's
greatest superspy...

08:50.549 --> 08:52.192
"who only exists
"in the mind

08:52.193 --> 08:55.704
of an overweight agoraphobic
"jazz musician...

08:56.371 --> 08:58.963
played by Martin Lawrence
in a fat suit."

09:04.316 --> 09:06.977
Oh, okay, here's one
from Springfield,

09:06.978 --> 09:08.532
made by a vegetarian...

09:08.585 --> 09:10.719
intellectual misfit...

09:11.123 --> 09:14.762
People, you know you have
to limit your gasps at this altitude.

09:14.773 --> 09:17.105
Oh, and she's eight years old!

09:30.949 --> 09:32.392
Stupid charities.

09:32.393 --> 09:34.520
They think I'm going
to give them money?

09:34.680 --> 09:37.241
Save the Children?
Save your breath.

09:37.242 --> 09:39.048
Take a hike, Sierra Club.

09:39.049 --> 09:40.498
Doctors without Borders?

09:40.499 --> 09:42.104
Doctors without money!

09:42.113 --> 09:44.902
Hey, Greenpeace, you're
not getting a piece of my green.

09:44.903 --> 09:46.676
Robert Redford? Guess what.

09:46.677 --> 09:48.845
A scissor runs through it.

09:49.344 --> 09:50.837
Dad, no!

09:53.721 --> 09:55.195
My movie got in!

09:55.196 --> 09:57.965
I'm going
to the Sundance Film Festival!

09:58.097 --> 10:00.311
Film festival, eh?

10:06.872 --> 10:08.665
Aye, los DVDs!

10:08.666 --> 10:11.369
With director's commentary
and deleted scenes!

10:15.684 --> 10:17.281
Where'd everybody go?

10:28.211 --> 10:31.736
I can't believe I'm a director
with a movie at Sundance.

10:31.934 --> 10:34.921
Maybe I can finally
meet Jim Jarmusch

10:34.922 --> 10:36.689
and ask him who he is.

10:36.690 --> 10:38.091
Hey, that's him.

10:38.682 --> 10:39.969
Who are you?

10:39.970 --> 10:42.384
I try to answer that
question in my films.

10:42.385 --> 10:43.543
What else?

10:43.544 --> 10:45.854
I can eat a raw onion
without crying.

10:45.855 --> 10:47.338
Prove it, Hollywood.

10:51.089 --> 10:52.801
Hey, you're crying.

10:52.802 --> 10:55.183
Yeah, but I'm crying
about something else.

10:55.184 --> 10:56.087
What?

10:56.088 --> 10:58.960
This is the last time
we'll ever be together.

11:00.785 --> 11:03.997
These badges will get us into any
of the independent movies

11:03.998 --> 11:05.471
playing at Sundance.

11:05.520 --> 11:07.379
Ooh, Regularsville.

11:07.380 --> 11:09.315
Sounds like my kind of place.

11:14.396 --> 11:17.007
Oh, Candyland.

11:17.008 --> 11:20.944
A great family game
is now a great family movie.

11:26.992 --> 11:28.045
I get it.

11:28.046 --> 11:31.427
Every title means the
opposite of what it means.

11:31.428 --> 11:35.281
Then I bet I'll love
Chernobyl Graveyard.

11:38.760 --> 11:39.990
I didn't.

11:42.025 --> 11:44.372
This is it: my premiere.

11:44.373 --> 11:46.883
We can't wait to see it, sweetie.

11:46.884 --> 11:49.244
Oh, a documentary?

11:51.439 --> 11:52.932
Passes, please.

11:52.987 --> 11:54.236
Uh, we're with them.

11:55.670 --> 11:57.229
You know these guys?

11:58.094 --> 11:59.596
I've never seen them before.

11:59.597 --> 12:01.154
Uh... we, uh...

12:02.093 --> 12:03.086
He's...

12:03.087 --> 12:04.190
He's, uh,

12:04.191 --> 12:05.050
he's, uh...

12:05.051 --> 12:06.196
That's a joke.

12:12.708 --> 12:14.436
This can't be real.

12:14.534 --> 12:18.731
It isn't. You crashed and now you're
lying unconscious in a snowbank.

12:22.642 --> 12:24.605
Chalmskinn.

12:27.198 --> 12:30.494
I'm Lisa Simpson,
and this is my family.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.523
One, two, three.

12:36.524 --> 12:37.751
Another chute?!

12:41.281 --> 12:43.135
Why... doesn't... life...

12:43.136 --> 12:45.112
give me... ladders?!

12:45.113 --> 12:48.477
We never get more than
one move into this game.

12:48.591 --> 12:50.920
What a wonderful film
about horrible people.

12:50.921 --> 12:54.565
They're like the family from
hell on acid that's on steroids.

12:59.755 --> 13:01.455
You stupid kid!

13:01.456 --> 13:03.633
What if I walked
in here barefoot?

13:03.634 --> 13:05.129
You did, Dad.

13:11.589 --> 13:13.251
Happy birthday, Mom.

13:13.731 --> 13:15.118
Thank you, dear.

13:18.022 --> 13:19.543
Brava, Lisa!

13:19.544 --> 13:20.832
Shame on Marge!

13:20.833 --> 13:22.494
Death to Maggie!

13:23.337 --> 13:25.891
Lisa, how could you?

13:25.892 --> 13:27.403
I didn't mean it like that.

13:27.404 --> 13:30.295
A lot of things got changed
in the editing room.

13:30.607 --> 13:33.367
Proudly edited by Lisa Simpson.

13:37.885 --> 13:41.368
Lisa, your movie exposed
our crappy side to the world.

13:41.462 --> 13:45.719
I knew you were lame, but
I never imagined you were bogus.

13:45.939 --> 13:50.943
Sweetie, I'm usually your #1 fan,
but... call me old-fashioned...

13:50.944 --> 13:54.080
I usually don't like movies
that humiliate my family

13:54.081 --> 13:55.545
in front of the world.

13:55.546 --> 13:58.112
Oh... I was just trying
to accurately portray

13:58.113 --> 14:00.767
my unique and quirky home life.

14:00.768 --> 14:04.457
Quirky? Quirky is a grandma
who gives people the finger.

14:04.458 --> 14:06.877
You made us look
like monsters.

14:06.878 --> 14:07.944
Monsters!

14:07.990 --> 14:09.162
Monsters!

14:09.190 --> 14:10.547
Monsters!

14:10.922 --> 14:14.047
Guys, guys, look,
it's a documentary.

14:14.048 --> 14:17.580
Nobody outside of this festival
is ever going to hear about it.

14:17.581 --> 14:21.279
"Lisa Simpson's unflinching,
darkly comic family portrait

14:21.280 --> 14:23.415
"is the can't-miss hit
of the festival.

14:23.416 --> 14:26.872
"Landspeeder, do not Bantha,
to your nearest cinema

14:26.873 --> 14:30.558
"to see Lisa Simpson stab her family
in the back with her camera."

14:30.655 --> 14:32.445
Don't you dare
post that review.

14:32.468 --> 14:34.027
I'm sorry. You're too late.

14:34.028 --> 14:37.079
I have just hit "enter," sending
the wi-fi beams along their way.

14:37.080 --> 14:39.154
Not if I can help it.
Come here, beams, come on.

14:39.155 --> 14:40.640
Hey, hey, where
you going? Come...

14:40.641 --> 14:42.063
Oh, there's too many.

14:44.210 --> 14:46.895
I just said
I was thinking of adopting

14:46.896 --> 14:50.102
Scarlett Johansson. I mean, is
that so wrong?

14:50.174 --> 14:52.834
Well, if we can't get into Sundance,
would you like to check out

14:52.835 --> 14:55.075
its alternative cousin Slamdance?

14:55.076 --> 14:56.286
I'd rather die.

14:56.287 --> 14:58.108
There they are: the producers

14:58.109 --> 14:59.667
of Capturing the Simpsons.

14:59.668 --> 15:00.921
Your movie's great.

15:00.922 --> 15:03.355
We want to be
in the Chalmskinn business.

15:03.356 --> 15:05.409
This is it, Seymour,
the big deal.

15:05.410 --> 15:06.900
Just play it cool.

15:06.901 --> 15:08.363
Look, we want
to buy this movie

15:08.364 --> 15:10.211
and we're prepared
to offer you anything.

15:10.212 --> 15:11.804
We're prepared
to accept anything.

15:11.805 --> 15:13.619
Name your price.

15:13.620 --> 15:15.990
We want ten percent
of the first-dollar gross,

15:15.991 --> 15:18.001
full European
distribution rights,

15:18.002 --> 15:21.758
and access to the most exclusive
VIP tent in Sundance.

15:25.298 --> 15:27.336
Way to make a
deal, Seymour.

15:27.337 --> 15:29.875
They don't even know
that my pockets are full

15:29.876 --> 15:31.771
of bottled water and cornbread.

15:32.706 --> 15:33.649
Yes.

15:40.785 --> 15:43.380
- It's them.
- Look at them walking around.

15:43.381 --> 15:45.197
Ugh, they're so creepy.

15:45.217 --> 15:47.401
Say something
dysfunctional!

15:47.402 --> 15:49.504
Let me get a picture of
you strangling my kid.

15:49.505 --> 15:50.345
No.

15:50.346 --> 15:52.392
Hey, we pay your salary.

15:54.192 --> 15:57.553
I never wanted to be famous
for being mean.

15:57.554 --> 16:01.470
I wanted to be famous
for catching Santa Claus.

16:02.410 --> 16:04.447
Let's just go back to the condo.

16:04.448 --> 16:06.153
We have to wash the dishes
and do the sheets

16:06.154 --> 16:08.083
so it's nice
for the next people.

16:08.302 --> 16:10.509
I can't believe
what I've done.

16:10.510 --> 16:13.955
Maybe deep down I always knew
how much this film would hurt them.

16:13.956 --> 16:16.433
Maybe I'm the monster
this movie exposed.

16:16.434 --> 16:18.206
Now what kind
of talk is that?

16:18.207 --> 16:21.135
Oh, hi,
Mr. Jarmusch.

16:21.219 --> 16:25.283
Lisa, I've been following your
family's turmoil closely, and I can relate.

16:25.284 --> 16:28.607
My movies, like Stranger
than Paradise and Down by Law,

16:28.608 --> 16:31.573
are also about social misfits
experiencing the dark side

16:31.574 --> 16:33.049
of the American dream.

16:33.050 --> 16:36.645
I'm doing it again in my next
film, Cheaper by the Dozen 3.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.914
That doesn't sound
like your kind of movie.

16:38.915 --> 16:41.028
It will be. Check out the poster.

16:43.883 --> 16:47.038
So, do you think my family
will ever forgive me

16:47.039 --> 16:48.827
for making them a laughingstock?

16:48.828 --> 16:52.000
The answer to that is
where it always is: in a movie.

16:52.001 --> 16:53.403
Let's take a look.

17:00.094 --> 17:03.164
Nelson? He couldn't have made
a movie by himself.

17:03.165 --> 17:04.290
Who helped him?

17:04.291 --> 17:05.953
Chalmskinn.

17:06.236 --> 17:09.131
Seymour Skinner never puts
all his eggs in one basket.

17:09.132 --> 17:12.192
That's why they call me
"Two Basket" Skinner.

17:12.685 --> 17:14.019
What? They do.

17:14.020 --> 17:15.290
I'm Nelson.

17:15.290 --> 17:16.682
This is my house.

17:16.704 --> 17:20.244
This is the impound lot that my
house gets towed to every night.

17:20.770 --> 17:22.098
Let's get going.

17:22.099 --> 17:24.637
We got to swing by the Laundromat,
steal me a new bra.

17:24.638 --> 17:27.383
You're going to be the classiest girl
at Classy Girls.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.629
No, no, no,
don't go in there.

17:36.630 --> 17:38.051
Oh, no, he did.

17:38.053 --> 17:40.260
Oh, man, that
is messed up.

17:40.261 --> 17:42.198
Whoa, what the
hell is that?

17:42.199 --> 17:44.198
It's just a cat.

17:44.199 --> 17:45.075
What?

17:45.076 --> 17:47.042
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah,
now I see it.

17:48.076 --> 17:50.826
Mom, there's
this school play tonight.

17:50.827 --> 17:53.221
It's called Kids Are People Too,

17:53.222 --> 17:57.212
and I play a grown-up who doesn't
think kids are people, too.

17:57.213 --> 17:59.907
So if you want
to come...

17:59.908 --> 18:02.391
Can't. I'm organizing
my Laramie Bucks.

18:02.392 --> 18:05.323
If I want that golf umbrella,
I got to get to smoking.

18:10.894 --> 18:13.542
Sometimes
I take the long way home,

18:13.731 --> 18:15.913
past the happy people's houses.

18:16.819 --> 18:21.477
I like to look inside and pretend
I have a family like theirs.

18:45.662 --> 18:49.136
I like to cry at the ocean,
because only there

18:49.259 --> 18:51.594
do my tears seem small.

19:06.475 --> 19:07.987
Thank you, Mr. Jarmusch.

19:07.988 --> 19:09.866
You have taught me
a valuable lesson:

19:09.867 --> 19:13.149
that other people have bigger
family problems than I do.

19:13.275 --> 19:16.886
True, but I was also teaching
you that festival buzz is,

19:16.887 --> 19:19.820
like my movie Coffee and
Cigarettes, a funny thing.

19:19.821 --> 19:22.135
- Did you see it?
- Well, I, uh...

19:22.226 --> 19:24.358
That's okay. I know you did.

19:24.359 --> 19:26.399
I like this movie
way better

19:26.400 --> 19:27.888
than the one by that little girl

19:27.889 --> 19:29.977
'cause I saw this one today.

19:30.331 --> 19:33.589
Wow, I guess
Nelson's the hot thing now.

19:33.590 --> 19:35.820
My movie will probably
never be seen.

19:35.821 --> 19:38.883
Oh, it will... on select flights
by Alaska Airlines

19:38.884 --> 19:40.808
and its regional partners.

19:40.915 --> 19:43.905
Okay,
only its regional partners. The point is:

19:43.906 --> 19:46.600
you made a great movie
and you ought to be proud.

19:46.601 --> 19:49.247
And now, like the best
independent films,

19:49.346 --> 19:51.988
I must fade out
with a cool dissolve.

19:53.914 --> 19:55.257
That hurts.

20:00.337 --> 20:02.900
Hey, Nelson, say
something poor.

20:05.630 --> 20:08.803
Oh, thank God they're not
jeering at us anymore.

20:08.804 --> 20:10.154
I know.

20:10.546 --> 20:12.576
- Kind of miss it.
- I know!

20:12.577 --> 20:16.210
We'll be in another movie, and
this time we'll act really bad.

20:16.211 --> 20:17.991
No more
Simpsons movies.

20:17.992 --> 20:19.604
One was plenty.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.660
Are you guys
still mad at me?

20:21.661 --> 20:23.618
We know you love us,
honey,

20:23.619 --> 20:26.845
even though sometimes
you show it in a "quirky" way.

20:31.884 --> 20:33.621
I'm not going
to lie to you guys.

20:33.622 --> 20:36.611
John C. Reilly would love to be
in the Chalmskinn business.

20:36.612 --> 20:38.126
Well, did you read
my script?

20:38.127 --> 20:41.617
Read it? I lived it. I am Ghost Willie.
Check this out.

20:46.352 --> 20:49.121
Fantastic. Gre... oh, bravo.

20:49.122 --> 20:50.728
You nailed it.

20:52.001 --> 20:54.525
I don't know. He, he
seems a little needy.

20:54.526 --> 20:55.640
Pass.

20:55.641 --> 20:57.247
We'll see you on the set.

20:57.248 --> 20:58.156
Yes!

21:04.977 --> 21:07.034
Chalmskinn.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.319
Another hit.

21:09.320 --> 21:10.626
Skinner!

21:10.627 --> 21:13.264
Why can't you be
a gentle clinker?
