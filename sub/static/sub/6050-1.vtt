-Bob from the depot, yeah.</font>

01:40.630 --> 01:44.046
<font color="#ffff00">the may be a link, between the meteor
strike, and the flying postman of Peckham.</font>

and the two things got all like...</font>

01:49.200 --> 01:50.700

- We didn't go out looking for Bob, Bob
came to us.</font>

02:00.713 --> 02:04.713
<font color="#ffff00">He handed himself in...
- Hey, Bob! <i>- Hello mate!</i> </font>

02:04.838 --> 02:09.420
<font color="#ffff00">He no control over his powers

- Bob? <i>Oh God! Oh, Jesus Christ,Oh!</i> </font>

02:21.630 --> 02:25.713
<font color="#ffff00">The flying postman from Peckham has been secluded
inside the Ministry of defense for the last four months.</font>

02:25.838 --> 02:29.088
<font color="#ffff00">Why are you doing that?
- just a bit nervous.</font>

02:29.421 --> 02:31.521
<font color="#ffff00">and he responded well...</font>

02:33.338 --> 02:37.171
<font color="#ffff00">And when we perfected the system,
Bob went out into the world.</font>

02:37.846 --> 02:39.871
<font color="#ffff00">After months of speculation,</font>

02:39.996 --> 02:45.296
<font color="#ffff00">the man who developed superpowers has been
unveiled by the British government. And his name...
is SuperBob.</font>

02:45.796 --> 02:49.005
<font color="#ffff00">I am proud of him, and of the work we do.</font>

02:59.463 --> 03:04.713
<font color="#ffff00">SuperBob will be working for the UK government,
and the Ministry of Defense.</font>

03:05.046 --> 03:09.421
<font color="#ffff00">The world will no longer be the same again.
A Superhero... for the real world.</font>

03:12.421 --> 03:15.255
<font color="#ffff00">It's funny what we get
used to, isn't it?</font>

03:15.380 --> 03:18.755
<font color="#ffff00">I mean... He can <i>fly.</i> </font>

03:26.130 --> 03:27.330
<font color="#ffff00">SuperBob.</font>

03:27.400 --> 03:28.960
<font color="#ffff00">...name's a bit wank.</font>

03:28.963 --> 03:33.796
<font color="#ffff00">It's arrogant, in a way but...
looks like it stick him.</font>

03:43.005 --> 03:48.171
<font color="#ffff00">Um, could you tell me your, uh...
your name, and your... job? Please.</font>

03:49.921 --> 03:52.171
<font color="#ffff00">My name is Teresa Maria Ford.</font>

03:52.963 --> 03:57.088
<font color="#ffff00">I am the head of the  emergency
response / disaster unit.</font>

03:58.380 --> 04:00.880
<font color="#ffff00">But you can't use any of that.</font>

04:01.921 --> 04:06.088
<font color="#ffff00">I can use it? - You can't use any of it, no.
- I can't use your name, even? - No. -Okay.</font>

04:06.921 --> 04:12.338
<font color="#ffff00">You have - you -  a very, very
important job, as far as I understand.
- Um-hm.</font>

04:12.921 --> 04:17.380
<font color="#ffff00">Could you tell us a little bit about
what that job involves?</font>

04:17.505 --> 04:19.605
<font color="#ffff00">No.</font>

04:20.713 --> 04:25.130
<font color="#ffff00">Would it be okay to ask you why
you wanted to make this film?</font>

04:25.255 --> 04:29.046
<font color="#ffff00">We feel that perhaps the public
doesn't  know the real Bob.</font>

04:29.171 --> 04:35.046
<font color="#ffff00">And I - I just feel it's really our
duty to let people know that Bob is</font>

04:36.505 --> 04:39.671
<font color="#ffff00">Just a regular guy.
Who can fly.</font>

04:42.213 --> 04:47.838
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, I have two bills. I've got one from British
Gas and one from you and, um</font>

04:47.963 --> 04:52.630
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, I'm sure it's my fault
I don't mind, it's just I wanted to...</font>

04:56.588 --> 05:00.380
<font color="#ffff00">Um... can I call you back in a bit, please?
Thank you.</font>

05:00.505 --> 05:04.088
<font color="#ffff00">Hello, I'm John, we're
making the film today.</font>

05:04.213 --> 05:08.755
<font color="#ffff00">Is that today? - Yeah, yeah it's today.
Theresa said you knew about it?</font>

05:13.005 --> 05:15.005
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, no - Bob...</font>

05:15.130 --> 05:18.180
<font color="#ffff00">Hi, I'm Bob, Bob...
Can I - can I -
... Good morning.</font>

05:18.305 --> 05:21.130
<font color="#ffff00">Just your normal voice is fine here, Bob.
No, Bob...</font>

05:21.255 --> 05:24.963
<font color="#ffff00">Good morning. - Just...
- Good morning! - Just this... - Hey, Hey!
- Bob, just wait!</font>

05:25.088 --> 05:27.671
<font color="#ffff00">Thanks for having us.
- You're welcome!</font>

05:27.796 --> 05:32.255
<font color="#ffff00">Hi, I'm Bob. -  Hey, Bob. - Hey, Doris.
That's Doris, that's my cleaner...</font>

05:32.380 --> 05:34.480
<font color="#ffff00">Have you done the sheets yet?</font>

05:36.005 --> 05:39.921
<font color="#ffff00">Not yet.
- then, can I start in the bathroom, please?</font>

05:41.255 --> 05:43.963
<font color="#ffff00">Yep. Makes sense.</font>

05:44.588 --> 05:50.713
<font color="#ffff00">'Kay, what is all this? - Um, they're making a
film to show that I'm normal.</font>

05:51.380 --> 05:53.480
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, good luck!</font>

05:53.796 --> 05:56.088
<font color="#ffff00">This way? - Yeah, that's great.</font>

06:02.130 --> 06:04.171
<font color="#ffff00">That's the way, right.</font>

06:04.296 --> 06:06.396
<font color="#ffff00">Yep.</font>

06:07.338 --> 06:10.838
<font color="#ffff00">May I ask you your name, and
your job, please?</font>

06:10.963 --> 06:15.588
<font color="#ffff00">You may. My name is Bob Kenner
and I'm a civil servant.</font>

06:16.130 --> 06:20.421
<font color="#ffff00">You don't say superhero?
- We don't use that word.</font>

06:20.630 --> 06:23.421
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, you can use that word, but,
I would...</font>

06:23.671 --> 06:29.255
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, it's just a job and I
have shifts just like anyone else.</font>

06:29.630 --> 06:33.171
<font color="#ffff00">So, just talk me through from, from,
You wake up, what happens?</font>

06:34.963 --> 06:40.421
<font color="#ffff00">Well, I get up and,
I've a massive wee...</font>

06:41.171 --> 06:44.588
<font color="#ffff00">A bomb goes off in Afghanistan,
Boom! Chaos!</font>

06:50.000 --> 06:54.900
<font color="#ffff00">I'm leaving a gap here so if you want to put like, news
footage of, you know, like a bomb, or chaos,</font>

06:54.921 --> 06:58.588
<font color="#ffff00">or whatever, just to, just to jazz up,
I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but</font>

06:58.713 --> 07:01.838
<font color="#ffff00"> I imagine this is probably just... pretty bleak.</font>

07:05.800 --> 07:07.800
<font color="#ffff00">This is an E-179.</font>

07:10.800 --> 07:14.800
<font color="#ffff00">This is to set up a temporary No Fly Zone,
make sure that nothing bumps into me up there,</font>

07:14.838 --> 07:19.546
<font color="#ffff00">which is actually quite  important because
there is a lot, there's a lot less room up there
than you might think.</font>

07:19.671 --> 07:24.463
<font color="#ffff00">Like I'm really, I'm really glad to be alive,
I'm really glad to have been saved,
but he's just a bit...</font>

07:24.588 --> 07:26.688
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, sign your own fucking form.</font>

07:27.000 --> 07:29.100
<font color="#ffff00">This is a combined insurance.</font>

07:29.255 --> 07:33.880
<font color="#ffff00">Eyewitnesses report that Kenner tried to
get the baby to sign a form.</font>

07:34.005 --> 07:36.755
<font color="#ffff00">He then panicked, and
quickly flew off.</font>

07:37.000 --> 07:38.800
<font color="#ffff00">Temporary jurisdiction proposal.</font>

07:39.000 --> 07:41.200
<font color="#ffff00">We. like. order.</font>

07:41.421 --> 07:43.713
<font color="#ffff00">An S12658P.</font>

07:43.963 --> 07:48.255
<font color="#ffff00">"I've got to fill out a form."
Of course you have to fill out a form!</font>

07:48.880 --> 07:51.005
<font color="#ffff00">How is there going to
be a record of it?</font>

07:51.130 --> 07:54.046
<font color="#ffff00">How would you rate the
experience out of ten?</font>

07:54.171 --> 07:57.255
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, a solid six, you know.
I mean, I didn't die.</font>

07:58.296 --> 08:02.963
<font color="#ffff00">There is a lot happening
- How stressful do you find your job?</font>

08:03.088 --> 08:06.338
<font color="#ffff00">Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.</font>

08:06.546 --> 08:11.213
<font color="#ffff00">Are you with <i>Eon</i> or <i>British Gas</i> ?
- Um, why?</font>

08:12.421 --> 08:17.171
<font color="#ffff00">Uh, I'm not taking sides or anything
but I think I might have signed up to
both of them by mistake.</font>

08:17.296 --> 08:19.971
<font color="#ffff00">I'm with <i>Southern Electric</i>.</font>

08:20.096 --> 08:24.080
<font color="#ffff00">Damnit. They came round last week,
I said I didn't have time.</font>

08:24.205 --> 08:27.546
<font color="#ffff00">Are they good?
- Seem to be. - Damn it!</font>

08:27.671 --> 08:31.880
<font color="#ffff00">Well, I was really excited to meet him,
because, you know, he can fly, for starters,</font>

08:32.005 --> 08:37.255
<font color="#ffff00">Which is brilliant,
But take that away, and really,
he's just a bit of a dullard.</font>

08:37.505 --> 08:41.546
<font color="#ffff00">And it pains me to say that 'cause all my
mates and me thoght he he was fit
before I met nim.</font>

08:41.671 --> 08:45.421
<font color="#ffff00">So I think the question that everybody
wants to know is...</font>

08:46.088 --> 08:48.630
<font color="#ffff00">Does SuperBob have a girlfriend?</font>

08:50.796 --> 08:53.838
<font color="#ffff00">No, SuperBob does not have a girlfriend.</font>

08:54.755 --> 09:00.255
<font color="#ffff00">Why is that?
- Because SuperBob is very busy.</font>

09:04.755 --> 09:06.855
<font color="#ffff00">This is Peckham.</font>

09:07.630 --> 09:10.213
<font color="#ffff00">Not the Ritz, but it's home.</font>

09:11.296 --> 09:16.588
<font color="#ffff00">People say it's a bt stabby, but it's
not actually. It's a bit, but it's not a lot.</font>

09:16.713 --> 09:19.921
<font color="#ffff00">The named this one after me.It's sweet, really.</font>

09:20.421 --> 09:22.521
<font color="#ffff00">Hello, mate.</font>

09:24.088 --> 09:26.455
<font color="#ffff00">Yo, air support.
- Yeah...</font>

09:26.580 --> 09:28.930
<font color="#ffff00">That's the "Sun Do, Sun Don't".
I call it that..</font>

09:29.055 --> 09:32.338
<font color="#ffff00">Full name is "Sun Do, Sun
Don't, Sun Don't Mind if you Do At All".</font>

09:32.463 --> 09:34.563
<font color="#ffff00">Just my little thing.</font>

09:34.880 --> 09:38.296
<font color="#ffff00">I mean I grew up in Peckham,
these are my ends.</font>

09:39.296 --> 09:43.046
<font color="#ffff00">Everyone's friendly.
- SuperPrick!</font>

09:44.130 --> 09:47.380
<font color="#ffff00">Except for Daren. From his state.</font>

09:48.296 --> 09:50.505
<font color="#ffff00">Not a fan.</font>

09:51.546 --> 09:54.463
<font color="#ffff00">Almost definitely not his bike.</font>

10:00.130 --> 10:05.505
<font color="#ffff00">This is my favorite thing to do.
I only really get to do it on my day off.</font>

10:28.700 --> 10:32.325
<font color="#ffff00">I mean it's... You know, it's, it's an
honor to have him.</font>

10:33.505 --> 10:35.605
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah.</font>

10:44.421 --> 10:47.380
<font color="#ffff00">That was amazing!
That was such a good one!</font>

10:47.505 --> 10:50.880
<font color="#ffff00">They were so good they said
we could finish early. That was amazing!</font>

10:51.005 --> 10:53.630
<font color="#ffff00">It's just so good to feel part of the community.</font>

10:53.755 --> 10:57.255
<font color="#ffff00">It's the Peckham people. You know what I mean?
It's just...</font>

11:06.046 --> 11:11.046
<font color="#ffff00">Sometimes I like to stay in on my day off as well.
Work on my projects.</font>

11:13.463 --> 11:19.463
<font color="#ffff00">This one is for someone... Special.</font>

11:23.380 --> 11:25.630
<font color="#ffff00">Hello? - David?</font>

11:25.755 --> 11:27.963
<font color="#ffff00">It's Bob, you called me.</font>

11:28.088 --> 11:31.088
<font color="#ffff00">Who is Bob? - Bob, your son.</font>

11:31.213 --> 11:34.046
<font color="#ffff00">You called me, Mum.
- I don't have a son.</font>

11:34.171 --> 11:37.213
<font color="#ffff00">If I had a son, he would come and visit me more.</font>

11:37.630 --> 11:43.671
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not suggesting that she's faking it, but I do
sometimes think that it's quite a convenient disease.</font>

11:43.796 --> 11:46.713
<font color="#ffff00">I heard that, Bob.
- Oh, now you remember my name.</font>

11:46.963 --> 11:50.838
<font color="#ffff00">So are there any downsides to your
amazing life, Bob?</font>

11:54.088 --> 12:00.296
<font color="#ffff00">It does get... lonely. Sometimes.</font>

12:11.713 --> 12:14.421
<font color="#ffff00">He struggles, 'cause he's got big fingers.</font>

12:15.088 --> 12:18.713
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry, who's that? - Oh that's Barry, my security.
- You have security?</font>

12:18.838 --> 12:23.630
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. It's a union thing, he has to watch over the house.
He's got a shed.</font>

12:24.046 --> 12:27.296
<font color="#ffff00">That seems... unnecessary. - Why?</font>

12:28.088 --> 12:32.421
<font color="#ffff00">Because you're invulnerable.
-Well, it's a union thing.</font>

12:34.571 --> 12:38.130
<font color="#ffff00">You were saying? He's got this thyroid problem
that affects him... - No, um no...</font>

12:38.255 --> 12:40.355
<font color="#ffff00">About being lonely.</font>

12:42.921 --> 12:45.021
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, um, right.</font>

12:46.421 --> 12:50.838
<font color="#ffff00">I guess, I have always wanted someone....</font>

12:53.963 --> 12:56.338
<font color="#ffff00">To shine my shoes with.</font>

12:57.963 --> 13:00.063
<font color="#ffff00">I never had that.</font>

13:01.380 --> 13:06.130
<font color="#ffff00">But today... today,  I am making changes.</font>

13:07.755 --> 13:11.380
<font color="#ffff00">Because today, I have a date.</font>

13:13.505 --> 13:15.671
<font color="#ffff00">That's great! - Yeah.</font>

13:16.213 --> 13:19.546
<font color="#ffff00">When were you last on a date?
- Six years ago.</font>

13:19.671 --> 13:23.338
<font color="#ffff00">Doris, I trying to do an interview! Sorry.</font>

13:27.363 --> 13:29.371
<font color="#ffff00">So, who's the date with?</font>

13:32.213 --> 13:36.421
<font color="#ffff00">June is... The most beautiful
girl in Peckham.</font>

13:36.546 --> 13:39.838
<font color="#ffff00">Can I say that?
I said it, it's true.</font>

13:41.171 --> 13:46.296
<font color="#ffff00">She's the most beautiful girl in
the world, and I've been all over.</font>

13:46.630 --> 13:50.797
<font color="#ffff00">I remember the very first conversation we
ever had, like it was yesterday.</font>

13:51.380 --> 13:56.130
<font color="#ffff00">She says to me, "Have you ever read
House of Leaves?" And I'm like, "No."</font>

13:56.255 --> 14:00.338
<font color="#ffff00">And she's like, "Well, you should." So I did.</font>

14:02.255 --> 14:04.355
<font color="#ffff00">That's where she works.</font>

14:06.088 --> 14:09.713
<font color="#ffff00">Anyway, I didn't get it. It's like this book, you
have to sort of turn it around as you read it,</font>

14:09.838 --> 14:13.505
<font color="#ffff00">It's like this sort of spiraling... I didn't get it.</font>

14:13.630 --> 14:17.005
<font color="#ffff00">But it was an icebreaker, because then...</font>

14:18.796 --> 14:22.130
<font color="#ffff00">Is that her?  - I don't know which one she is.
- She's the most beautiful one. Oh, I...</font>

14:22.255 --> 14:25.046
<font color="#ffff00">Go go go go go, I'm going to look like
a right wheeler...</font>

14:25.171 --> 14:27.171
<font color="#ffff00">He's been coming in, for about six months.</font>

14:27.296 --> 14:30.463
<font color="#ffff00">He comes in every Tuesday
I know because I've been counting.</font>

14:30.588 --> 14:34.588
<font color="#ffff00">Because it's... Well, you know. Him. In here.</font>

14:36.380 --> 14:40.921
<font color="#ffff00">Everyone else is used to it, but...
I guess I'm just not..</font>

14:43.796 --> 14:47.546
<font color="#ffff00">This is where I used to work.I used to love working here,
because people are always excited....</font>

14:47.671 --> 14:51.255
<font color="#ffff00">Oh! Bob, come here!
- They'd be excited to get...</font>

14:51.380 --> 14:54.963
<font color="#ffff00">Bob, one second, just come here and...
- I don't know who she is.</font>

14:55.338 --> 14:57.921
<font color="#ffff00">Bob. Come here.</font>

14:58.888 --> 15:01.421
<font color="#ffff00">You must listen to big people when
when they talk and talk to you.</font>

15:01.546 --> 15:04.005
<font color="#ffff00">Hold this for me, I'll soon come.
I'm gonna go on to the butcher's.</font>

15:04.130 --> 15:07.630
<font color="#ffff00">I'm just going to the butcher's
before it close. Please, just hold it, yes indeedy</font>

15:07.755 --> 15:10.005
<font color="#ffff00">Just hold it, I'll soon come, Okay.</font>

15:12.671 --> 15:15.046
<font color="#ffff00">Well, he's just not like other guys.</font>

15:15.171 --> 15:18.463
<font color="#ffff00">I mean... He's really not.</font>

15:20.005 --> 15:23.713
<font color="#ffff00">Like, every week I was taking out  books
and bringing them back.</font>

15:23.838 --> 15:27.380
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, he is a voracious reader.
- I was not reading any of them.</font>

15:27.505 --> 15:32.172
<font color="#ffff00">He's read my favorite book,
which is very romantic.</font>

15:32.338 --> 15:36.838
<font color="#ffff00">Because it's not an easy book.
- And then, after about six months...</font>

15:36.963 --> 15:43.005
<font color="#ffff00">He started like, hanging around my desk a lot...
- Just like, mumbling about, around her like an idiot.</font>

15:43.130 --> 15:46.630
<font color="#ffff00">I thought, "Does he like me?"</font>

15:46.880 --> 15:52.505
<font color="#ffff00">Eventually...
- Would SuperBob ever ask me out?</font>

15:53.005 --> 15:55.963
<font color="#ffff00">Finally...
- Like, ever?</font>

15:56.088 --> 15:58.671
<font color="#ffff00">She asked <i>me</i> out..</font>

15:58.796 --> 16:00.896
<font color="#ffff00">And he said yes.</font>

16:01.588 --> 16:03.596
<font color="#ffff00">It was unbelievable.</font>

16:03.721 --> 16:07.921
<font color="#ffff00">So, finally, we're going on our date.
Today.</font>

16:09.213 --> 16:11.630
<font color="#ffff00">Lunch. One o'clock.</font>

16:12.463 --> 16:14.713
<font color="#ffff00">And I am very excited about it.</font>

16:14.921 --> 16:17.213
<font color="#ffff00">There is no accounting for tastes.</font>

16:21.338 --> 16:26.171
<font color="#ffff00">I do actually need Maureen,  because I don't
have a photo ID, so...</font>

16:26.296 --> 16:28.396
<font color="#ffff00">I am done.</font>

16:33.421 --> 16:37.754
<font color="#ffff00">It's Theresa. She wants to take me shopping
for clothes for the date.</font>

16:38.338 --> 16:41.630
<font color="#ffff00">I don't need her for that.
I can buy clothes.</font>

16:43.213 --> 16:45.213
<font color="#ffff00">How hard is it to buy clothes?</font>

16:45.338 --> 16:50.588
<font color="#ffff00">Doris, I need you to help me buy clothes, I've made
a terrible mistake. You need to take me shopping.</font>

16:50.721 --> 16:55.421
<font color="#ffff00">I don't want to turn up at this date... - You're like
a pedophile. - Is that what this combo says to you?</font>

16:55.546 --> 16:59.046
<font color="#ffff00">It's not just the clothes, it's the face.
- Okay, well that's terrible,  I need clothes...</font>

16:59.171 --> 17:01.838
<font color="#ffff00">You look like a man who has not
touched a woman in six years.</font>

17:01.963 --> 17:04.805
<font color="#ffff00">I need clothes where I turn up and
I don't look like a weirdo.</font>

17:04.930 --> 17:08.980
<font color="#ffff00">You look desperate, and insane...
 - You look like a terrorist. - Hello, Barry.
- That's because of his eyebrows.</font>

17:09.105 --> 17:12.255
<font color="#ffff00">What is wrong with eyebrows?
-Terroristic. - You have terrorist eyebrows.</font>

17:12.380 --> 17:15.338
<font color="#ffff00">I will buy you something.
- Anything?</font>

17:16.463 --> 17:19.380
<font color="#ffff00">Yep. What do you need? - Socks.</font>

17:19.505 --> 17:22.463
<font color="#ffff00">Let's go. You stay here. Just Doris.</font>

17:23.963 --> 17:27.380
<font color="#ffff00">Alright, I'll stay, it's alright.
I'll have a bath or something.</font>

17:29.796 --> 17:35.046
<font color="#ffff00">We'll walk one to the other and see
everything. In... two minutes.</font>

17:35.171 --> 17:40.838
<font color="#ffff00">Hey! Umm... - Oh, Karl! - Why don't you call me
anymore? - 'Cause... we had our fun.</font>

17:40.963 --> 17:45.630
<font color="#ffff00">But I want more fun!
- We had our fun! Come on, Bob.</font>

17:45.755 --> 17:49.255
<font color="#ffff00">Enjoying your day off, SuperBob?
- Oh, yes, thanks!</font>

17:49.380 --> 17:51.546
<font color="#ffff00">You lazy shit!</font>

17:52.130 --> 17:54.463
<font color="#ffff00">Do not listen to her. - I didn't.</font>

17:55.880 --> 18:00.380
<font color="#ffff00">I thought you were still with Javier.
- Yes? Oh, Javier was over weeks ago.</font>

18:00.505 --> 18:05.946
<font color="#ffff00">I'm so hungry. You like lemon?
- I'm okay with lemons, is that what you want to eat it?
- No.</font>

18:06.071 --> 18:08.130
<font color="#ffff00">What is this?
- A pa pa.</font>

18:08.255 --> 18:13.088
<font color="#ffff00">A pa pa? - What do you want to eat?
I don't know what it is. I always have...
Curiosity, what is it?</font>

18:13.213 --> 18:16.963
<font color="#ffff00">Is it meat? Is it
cold, is it hot?</font>

18:38.088 --> 18:40.921
<font color="#ffff00">What was wrong with Javier?</font>

18:42.171 --> 18:44.505
<font color="#ffff00">He always took me bowling.</font>

18:44.630 --> 18:46.880
<font color="#ffff00">You hate bowling. - I know.</font>

18:49.963 --> 18:53.213
<font color="#ffff00">I'm Bob's cleaner.
I clean twice a week.</font>

18:53.338 --> 18:56.713
<font color="#ffff00">I also work at the care home
where his mother lives.</font>

18:56.838 --> 19:01.963
<font color="#ffff00">I became very friendly with Mrs. Kenner.
And she tells me her son needs help.</font>

19:02.088 --> 19:04.421
<font color="#ffff00">He cannot tie his own shoelaces.</font>

19:04.546 --> 19:08.046
<font color="#ffff00">And... that is how I was stuck with Bob.</font>

19:08.921 --> 19:13.171
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. What, you're "Eon"?
I thought I'd already spoken to you this...</font>

19:13.296 --> 19:16.713
<font color="#ffff00">Is that "British Gas"?
Do you like this? - No.</font>

19:16.838 --> 19:22.546
<font color="#ffff00">the, the thing is...
- I came here to raise money to
pay for a nursery in Colombia.</font>

19:23.755 --> 19:28.838
<font color="#ffff00">It's taken me...  six years, and I have
barely raised any money.</font>

19:30.338 --> 19:33.921
<font color="#ffff00">They not pay shit in this country.
- I heard that.</font>

19:34.255 --> 19:36.796
<font color="#ffff00">I found this really beautiful
monastery in Tibet.</font>

19:36.921 --> 19:39.796
<font color="#ffff00">I'm gonna fly us there, I'm
gonna sit on this clifftop,</font>

19:39.921 --> 19:44.630
<font color="#ffff00">We overlook the whole of the place, we eat noodles...
Why are you laughing? - Are you joking?</font>

19:44.755 --> 19:50.713
<font color="#ffff00">No. - For a first date? -Yes.
- Do you want to look crazy?
- I definitely don't want to look crazy.</font>

19:50.838 --> 19:54.630
<font color="#ffff00">Take her to... take her to the
"Kari Kabin" in Peckham.</font>

19:54.796 --> 19:58.671
<font color="#ffff00">Really? - Yes, with your legs.
Don't be so keen.</font>

19:58.796 --> 20:02.671
<font color="#ffff00">It's a nice place. Buy her Tika Masala,
ask her lots of questions. - Like what?</font>

20:02.796 --> 20:05.963
<font color="#ffff00">Don't ask who supplies her
fucking gas.</font>

20:06.821 --> 20:08.930
<font color="#ffff00">I wasn't going to.</font>

20:09.055 --> 20:11.130
<font color="#ffff00">... I wasn't going to!</font>

20:11.255 --> 20:13.338
<font color="#ffff00">Ask her something personal.</font>

20:13.463 --> 20:16.838
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, um... is your mother still
alive? - No, something else.</font>

20:16.963 --> 20:20.588
<font color="#ffff00">And then, if it goes well,
then you can fly her about.</font>

20:20.713 --> 20:25.296
<font color="#ffff00">Okay. - Don't play all your cards at once.
You'll scare her away.</font>

20:25.421 --> 20:31.543
<font color="#ffff00">It's going to be alright, though, isn't it? I just got
to be myself, right?
- Not if you want her to like you.</font>

20:31.668 --> 20:34.738
<font color="#ffff00">Bob, when you're on this date,
turn off your fucking phone.</font>

20:34.863 --> 20:37.896
<font color="#ffff00">Women hate being interrupted by fucking phones.
- It's Theresa. It's Theresa, I have to take it.</font>

20:38.021 --> 20:42.546
<font color="#ffff00">Fuck Theresa! Don't answer! It's your day off...
- Hello? Hey, hello Theresa. No, no, no no,
I'm listening to angry Spanish talk radio.</font>

20:42.671 --> 20:45.555
<font color="#ffff00">I need you to come into the office now.
- But... - It's an emergency.</font>

20:45.680 --> 20:48.763
<font color="#ffff00">Theresa, it's my day off.
- In my office, now, Bob.</font>

20:48.888 --> 20:51.221
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, if it's an emergency.
- It's a fucking emergency, Bob!</font>

20:51.346 --> 20:54.413
<font color="#ffff00">I have to go, I'm sorry.
Can you take care of everything?</font>

20:54.538 --> 20:57.230
<font color="#ffff00">What about your date?
You're just going to cancel because the MOD called?</font>

20:57.355 --> 21:00.413
<font color="#ffff00">No, No, I will go quickly to the MOD
and then I'll rush to my date.</font>

21:00.538 --> 21:05.421
<font color="#ffff00">It will be fine, there'll be enough time.
- What if there's not time? - Then, I'll postpone the date.</font>

21:05.546 --> 21:08.380
<font color="#ffff00">You are pathetic!
- I'm not pathetic, what choice do I have?</font>

21:08.505 --> 21:14.046
<font color="#ffff00">What did these people do before you, Bob?
Sometimes we have to say "No"!
- I can't say "No" to the Ministry of Defence!</font>

21:14.171 --> 21:18.005
<font color="#ffff00">It's not so hard to say "No".
- It's very hard to say...
- "No. Theresa, no, it's my day off."</font>

21:18.130 --> 21:20.796
<font color="#ffff00">This from a woman who has never said
No in her entire life!</font>

21:20.921 --> 21:25.338
<font color="#ffff00">"Oh, yes, Javier, yes, Karl,
yes, Simon, yes, Brian.</font>

21:25.505 --> 21:28.880
<font color="#ffff00">I literally don't know the
meaning of the word 'No!" "</font>

21:31.130 --> 21:36.463
<font color="#ffff00">What did you say? - It was a...
doesn't matter, it was just a joke.</font>

21:36.630 --> 21:39.505
<font color="#ffff00">What, you think a woman is not allowed
to have many partners?</font>

21:39.630 --> 21:42.838
<font color="#ffff00">No, of course I don't think that.
-You think it makes her a whore, do you?</font>

21:42.963 --> 21:47.546
<font color="#ffff00">A woman living her life, choosing what she wants to...
- I don't think all women are whores.</font>

21:47.671 --> 21:51.463
<font color="#ffff00">just you! I can't believe that
was the end of that sentence.</font>

21:51.588 --> 21:54.963
<font color="#ffff00">I really thought there would be other words,
which would make it sound better,</font>

21:55.088 --> 22:01.421
<font color="#ffff00">Can I get <i>anything</i> ? - I'd take your losses, mate.
-Yeah, I have to go. I...</font>

22:01.713 --> 22:05.588
<font color="#ffff00">Wait, I have a form for you.
It says... to go fuck yourself.</font>

22:07.296 --> 22:10.796
<font color="#ffff00">It's blank.
- It says, "Go fuck yourself."
Please sign it.</font>

22:10.921 --> 22:13.880
<font color="#ffff00">It doesn't say anything.
- It's psychic paper.</font>

22:17.630 --> 22:19.730
<font color="#ffff00">Full name, please.</font>

22:21.380 --> 22:23.480
<font color="#ffff00">Can I please go now?</font>

22:24.630 --> 22:26.963
<font color="#ffff00">Go. Do your fucking thing.</font>

22:32.805 --> 22:36.088
<font color="#ffff00">What's the emergency? -The American
situation is frying.</font>

22:36.213 --> 22:39.713
<font color="#ffff00">Where do I need to be? - Here, for a handshake.
 - Is that code?</font>

22:39.838 --> 22:42.088
<font color="#ffff00">No, it's a handshake.
- Right.</font>

22:42.213 --> 22:46.171
<font color="#ffff00">The senator is joining us for lunch,
you need you here for a Photo Op.</font>

22:46.296 --> 22:51.838
<font color="#ffff00">Just a handshake, nothing heavy.
Just a Handshake. And a hug. And hold a baby.</font>

22:51.963 --> 22:55.880
<font color="#ffff00">We've got a few scenarios that they've
agreed to. Um, the classic handhshake...</font>

22:56.005 --> 22:59.088
<font color="#ffff00">Hang on, what is this? - I need to
show you're not dangerous.</font>

22:59.213 --> 23:01.655
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not dangerous. - I know that.
- I've never hurt anyone.</font>

23:01.780 --> 23:06.130
<font color="#ffff00">We know you're not dangerous, Bob, but
this is the United States, they still haven't
forgiven us. - For what? - For you.</font>

23:06.255 --> 23:08.296
<font color="#ffff00">They're still pissed off you're ours.</font>

23:08.421 --> 23:11.005
<font color="#ffff00">I'm going to tell you this off the record.</font>

23:12.088 --> 23:14.188
<font color="#ffff00">Off the record, okay?</font>

23:16.005 --> 23:19.796
<font color="#ffff00">About a year ago, America
made a move on Bob.</font>

23:20.463 --> 23:23.046
<font color="#ffff00">They tried to poach him,
but we wouldn't let him go.</font>

23:23.171 --> 23:29.505
<font color="#ffff00">And ever since then, a smear
campaign started, from across the Pond.</font>

23:30.005 --> 23:32.105
<font color="#ffff00">Infecting everything.</font>

23:33.046 --> 23:35.146
<font color="#ffff00">Coincidence?</font>

23:36.046 --> 23:38.146
<font color="#ffff00">You do the math.</font>

23:38.880 --> 23:42.838
<font color="#ffff00">In Texas today SuperBob saved 400 children
from a burning school.</font>

23:42.963 --> 23:46.963
<font color="#ffff00">There were no injuries. - They send him into a
burning school to save the children.</font>

23:47.088 --> 23:50.380
<font color="#ffff00">Now I'm not disagreeing that he saved the children,
he did save the children, that's by the by.</font>

23:50.505 --> 23:55.546
<font color="#ffff00">But what kind of "Superhero"
smashes up a school? A <i>school</i> ?</font>

23:58.921 --> 24:03.671
<font color="#ffff00">Now, this is one of their favorites.
It's you, kneeling, obviously.</font>

24:04.505 --> 24:10.630
<font color="#ffff00">With a gigantic American flag,
like, flapping behind you.</font>

24:11.338 --> 24:15.255
<font color="#ffff00">Does it have to be today?
- Yes, they're all here for tonight's summit.</font>

24:15.380 --> 24:20.005
<font color="#ffff00">It's my day off. - Do you think I like calling you
in on your day off? Because I don't.</font>

24:20.130 --> 24:24.088
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, it makes me feel awfull, but unfortunately,
that is part of my job.</font>

24:24.213 --> 24:26.421
<font color="#ffff00">Now this deal has taken a long
time to broker.</font>

24:26.546 --> 24:31.171
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, these mountains are not currently snowcapped.
Now these are not condors, they are not vultures,</font>

24:31.296 --> 24:35.338
<font color="#ffff00">Don't make the same mistake I did,
they are bald eagles.</font>

24:35.463 --> 24:40.546
<font color="#ffff00">Um, their handler is a lovely man named Clint...
- What about my date? - What?</font>

24:41.046 --> 24:43.146
<font color="#ffff00">My date.</font>

24:44.463 --> 24:50.213
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, Bob. She'll wait.
- They're no danger to Bob, in any way.</font>

24:50.421 --> 24:53.463
<font color="#ffff00">Postpone the date. She'll be fine.</font>

24:54.046 --> 25:01.130
<font color="#ffff00">We will however have like, a few carcases,
sort of scattered around the rocks,</font>

25:01.255 --> 25:04.463
<font color="#ffff00">to get them interested, to get them excited,
to get them swooshing.</font>

25:06.838 --> 25:08.938
<font color="#ffff00">If they do go for Bob...</font>

25:09.713 --> 25:11.813
<font color="#ffff00">What if I don't want to?</font>

25:12.546 --> 25:14.646
<font color="#ffff00">What do you mean?</font>

25:15.505 --> 25:19.130
<font color="#ffff00">Could I say no?
- Could you say...</font>

25:20.755 --> 25:25.921
<font color="#ffff00">Bob. No. - Doris says I should
say "No" more...</font>

25:26.046 --> 25:29.130
<font color="#ffff00">What the fuck does Doris have to
do with world security?</font>

25:29.255 --> 25:32.088
<font color="#ffff00">She's my cleaner.
- I know who she is.</font>

25:35.255 --> 25:40.463
<font color="#ffff00">And finally... the hot dog.
- <i>Yeah, I like that</i>.</font>

25:40.588 --> 25:43.213
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, I'll do the handshake one.</font>

25:45.296 --> 25:51.005
<font color="#ffff00">Next Tuesday, I promise. I promise.
It's just... my work...</font>

25:53.838 --> 25:58.296
<font color="#ffff00">You're being a lot more understanding than I expected,
I actually thought you'd be angrier.</font>

25:58.963 --> 26:02.505
<font color="#ffff00">It's just... I have to do it. Apparently.</font>

26:04.921 --> 26:08.046
<font color="#ffff00">No, I can't keep messing you around,
it's not all, it's not alright,</font>

26:08.171 --> 26:11.171
<font color="#ffff00">It's not alright. It isn't alright.</font>

26:12.296 --> 26:17.171
<font color="#ffff00">Do you know what, June?
We're going to have this date.</font>

26:24.838 --> 26:29.213
<font color="#ffff00">Hello, June? No, we didn't get cut off,
I hung up.</font>

26:29.338 --> 26:31.921
<font color="#ffff00"> No, no, no, you hadn't done anything wrong.</font>

26:32.046 --> 26:35.588
<font color="#ffff00">No, I should have said goodby. I should have said goodby,
I was being  dramatic.</font>

26:35.713 --> 26:37.880
<font color="#ffff00">I was being dramatic, it was stupid.
I should've...</font>

26:38.005 --> 26:41.296
<font color="#ffff00">I should've said goodby,
But I thought I'd hang up, and then  I'd go and do...</font>

26:41.421 --> 26:44.505
<font color="#ffff00">And then to go and do something,
and then maybe, maybe I could see you.</font>

26:44.630 --> 26:47.338
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, you go when I...
Okay, Bye!</font>

26:47.463 --> 26:51.380
<font color="#ffff00">Okay. No, it doesn't matter.Okay.
Bye! Okay. Um...
Uh.</font>

26:52.296 --> 26:54.588
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not really wild about....</font>

26:56.463 --> 27:00.421
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not doing it. - Oh, Bob. Okay...
- No. I'm saying No.</font>

27:00.546 --> 27:03.946
<font color="#ffff00">Listen to me, Bob. She will wait.
-You heard me.
- I told you, I promise you she will...</font>

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
<font color="#ffff00">Fucking, NO!</font>

27:11.296 --> 27:16.421
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry I had to swear word with that,
that was unnecessary, I'm very excited, but...</font>

27:16.546 --> 27:19.755
<font color="#ffff00">Right, you don't know what you're doing.
Stop making a scene!</font>

27:19.880 --> 27:24.255
<font color="#ffff00">Doris, I did it! I said "No".
Yeah, it's Bob. Yeah.</font>

27:24.921 --> 27:29.171
<font color="#ffff00">I'm going to take her to the "Kari Kabin"
and I'm going to ask her lots of questions.</font>

27:34.880 --> 27:40.047
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, sorry Doris. I hung up again,
I should've said goodby...</font>

28:09.221 --> 28:12.821
<font color="#ffff00">Bob, you need to come! - How did you find me?
- I told you to come here! Why is your phone off?</font>

28:12.946 --> 28:15.946
<font color="#ffff00">You told me to turn my phone off!
- Why are you shouting at me?</font>

28:16.000 --> 28:18.583
<font color="#ffff00">Your mother fell. She hurt herself.</font>

28:30.380 --> 28:32.880
<font color="#ffff00">Ooh! What's that?</font>

28:34.338 --> 28:40.588
<font color="#ffff00">You banged your head, Mum.
- Did I? That was silly of me. - Yeah, it was.</font>

28:41.546 --> 28:43.646
<font color="#ffff00">Hi, Doris. - Hi.</font>

28:44.421 --> 28:48.005
<font color="#ffff00">It's been too long. - Javier...</font>

28:48.130 --> 28:53.130
<font color="#ffff00">I haven't shown you all my moves.
- I've seen enough of your moves.</font>

29:00.171 --> 29:02.255
<font color="#ffff00">You know what would make me happy, don't you?</font>

29:02.380 --> 29:05.130
<font color="#ffff00">What's that, Mum?
- To see you with a nice girl.</font>

29:05.255 --> 29:09.546
<font color="#ffff00">That's all I want. To see you with a nice girl.
- I know that's "all" you want.</font>

29:09.671 --> 29:13.630
<font color="#ffff00">Then why won't you give it to me?
- Mum... - I'll die sooner than you think.</font>

29:13.755 --> 29:17.421
<font color="#ffff00">Mum, why do you always say that?
- I could die today.</font>

29:17.546 --> 29:21.713
<font color="#ffff00">You know, it's horrible when you say that! I really hate it.
- Bob, if you don't like touching women...</font>

29:21.838 --> 29:26.255
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, come on! I touch women.
I touch women all the time with my hands!</font>

29:29.796 --> 29:31.896
<font color="#ffff00">Only when they ask.</font>

29:33.088 --> 29:35.188
<font color="#ffff00">And when do them ask?</font>

29:35.463 --> 29:37.563
<font color="#ffff00">They don't.
... Um hmm.</font>

29:38.213 --> 29:42.013
<font color="#ffff00">... naked and proud in front of her, and I would say, "Doris..."</font>

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
<font color="#ffff00">Javier.
- Bob.</font>

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
<font color="#ffff00">What are you doing? Mum, put that away!
- If you're  never going to be with a woman, then I
may as well be dead!</font>

29:51.096 --> 29:53.996
<font color="#ffff00">Mum, stop threatening to die!
This is exhausting!</font>

29:54.130 --> 29:56.671
<font color="#ffff00">I do not want you to die. Give me those pills,
this is awful!</font>

29:58.000 --> 30:00.900
<font color="#ffff00">- If you would just be with a girl...
- I'm with a girl! I'm with a girl! I'm with a girl!</font>

30:01.000 --> 30:03.800
<font color="#ffff00">Really? - Yes, I promise. I'm with a girl. I'm with a girl,
And she's great,and you'd love her.</font>

30:04.000 --> 30:10.800
<font color="#ffff00">Who is she? - she's um... it's um...
Doris! It's Doris. - Yes?
- Oh, Good! I love Doris!</font>

30:11.000 --> 30:13.900
<font color="#ffff00">Okay then it's not Doris. - It's Doris!
 -What?</font>

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
<font color="#ffff00">My favorite girl in the world!
- Okay, wait...</font>

30:16.171 --> 30:18.630
<font color="#ffff00">Why is she crying?
- Bob just told me the truth!</font>

30:18.755 --> 30:22.213
<font color="#ffff00">What did you tell her?
- I told her something... Wait.</font>

30:22.338 --> 30:25.338
<font color="#ffff00">I always wanted you to be with my Bob.
- I didn't know she would say this...</font>

30:25.463 --> 30:28.455
<font color="#ffff00">I knew it would come this day.
-Doris, please...</font>

30:28.580 --> 30:32.671
<font color="#ffff00">I both love you so much.
- You've made me the happiest woman.</font>

30:32.796 --> 30:37.671
<font color="#ffff00">Could I have a quick word? Just a quick word, Doris.
- Yes, Mrs. Kenner. -Doris...</font>

30:38.630 --> 30:42.955
<font color="#ffff00">No, I don't want to do it!
- It's not bad. - It's bad, I don't want to lie.</font>

30:43.080 --> 30:46.080
<font color="#ffff00">How would she ever believe her only son with such a whore?
- Doris,</font>

30:46.205 --> 30:51.088
<font color="#ffff00">She will find out! Why would I do this?
- Because I've never seen her that happy.</font>

30:51.213 --> 30:55.505
<font color="#ffff00">Ever. And she will forget,
in an... hour.</font>

30:58.213 --> 31:00.380
<font color="#ffff00">So why can't we just make her happy?</font>

31:00.921 --> 31:03.021
<font color="#ffff00">Just for a moment.</font>

31:08.880 --> 31:10.980
<font color="#ffff00">Come on then!</font>

31:19.713 --> 31:22.713
<font color="#ffff00">My Bobby and Doris are a couple.</font>

31:25.630 --> 31:27.796
<font color="#ffff00">A la? People?</font>

31:30.255 --> 31:39.255
<font color="#ffff00">Ladies and gentlemen,
 Sorry to interrupt, but we are of course here
to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Gladis and Ted.</font>

31:40.000 --> 31:42.100
<font color="#ffff00"> Well done, you two!</font>

31:46.000 --> 31:48.291
<font color="#ffff00">Now, as a special treat,</font>

31:49.000 --> 31:54.000
<font color="#ffff00">Doris, our Doris has said that her new boyfriend SuperBob...</font>

31:54.500 --> 31:59.500
<font color="#ffff00">No, me no believe it... is gonna
give a little speech.</font>

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
<font color="#ffff00">Bobby.
- No, no, no, why woiuld you do that?</font>

32:21.500 --> 32:24.500
<font color="#ffff00">Hiya.</font>

32:30.000 --> 32:32.100
<font color="#ffff00">Gladys and...</font>

32:35.000 --> 32:37.583
<font color="#ffff00">Ted.</font>

32:38.000 --> 32:41.917
<font color="#ffff00">You guys... I've seen you guys
over the last few years</font>

32:43.255 --> 32:47.588
<font color="#ffff00">There you are! There you are, and you look well</font>

32:49.130 --> 32:55.796
<font color="#ffff00">Sixty years. That is a fucking long time.
I'm sorry, I don't know why I'm swearing,</font>

32:55.921 --> 32:59.713
<font color="#ffff00">That's twice today, that is very out of character.
I apologize.</font>

32:59.838 --> 33:05.380
<font color="#ffff00">You're the sort of couple... that are
going to die...</font>

33:06.621 --> 33:08.671
<font color="#ffff00">Very soon.</font>

33:08.796 --> 33:11.046
<font color="#ffff00">After each other, after each other,</font>

33:11.171 --> 33:16.755
<font color="#ffff00">But not like from cancer, or because, like, you
caught something off the other one,</font>

33:16.880 --> 33:21.213
<font color="#ffff00">but because, like, as soon as one of you dies,
the other one will be like,</font>

33:22.505 --> 33:25.796
<font color="#ffff00">Ahh, ahh,My heart, I can't,
... being crushed, I just...</font>

33:25.921 --> 33:29.880
<font color="#ffff00">I've just, gone, sort of immed-
within a week.</font>

33:32.838 --> 33:35.713
<font color="#ffff00">A mean, that's what we want, isn't it?</font>

33:36.005 --> 33:38.671
<font color="#ffff00">Not for you to be dead, not in any way,</font>

33:38.796 --> 33:41.255
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, if your in pain, please, go ahead,
you know...</font>

33:41.380 --> 33:46.046
<font color="#ffff00">we'll be, we'll cope, but we'll miss you,
the point is, you should stay, let's...</font>

33:48.296 --> 33:50.713
<font color="#ffff00">That's what we all want, isn't it?</font>

33:50.838 --> 33:55.046
<font color="#ffff00">To be with someone who, when they die, you're like,</font>

33:56.296 --> 33:59.338
<font color="#ffff00">"Well, that's it for me, too."</font>

34:04.963 --> 34:11.005
<font color="#ffff00">Anyway, Happy Love Day! and,
and well done on 60 years</font>

34:11.138 --> 34:14.905
<font color="#ffff00">And you weren't married at birth,
so you must be... old, so chin up!</font>

34:15.030 --> 34:19.280
<font color="#ffff00">And thank you, for the music,
Cheers! and, good night.</font>

34:22.630 --> 34:24.929
<font color="#ffff00">- Awful!
- I hate you.</font>

34:25.000 --> 34:28.416
<font color="#ffff00">Very deep.
- Oh, when are you gonna stop punishing me?</font>

34:28.670 --> 34:31.588
<font color="#ffff00">I haven't decided yet.
-Thank you, Bob.</font>

34:31.713 --> 34:35.630
<font color="#ffff00">Now, I'm joined in the studio today
by the American Senator Bill Jackson.</font>

34:35.755 --> 34:39.338
<font color="#ffff00">Senator, you're in town for
today's weapon summit.</font>

34:39.463 --> 34:42.505
<font color="#ffff00">What exactly is it that you're hoping to
achieve here in the UK, senator?</font>

34:42.630 --> 34:46.096
<font color="#ffff00">I want to out an end to Britain's
monopoly on a highly dangerous weapon.</font>

34:46.221 --> 34:49.588
<font color="#ffff00">Ah, but SuperBob isn't in fact a weapon, is he?
He's a man.</font>

34:49.713 --> 34:52.920
<font color="#ffff00">The fact that he refused
to meet with me today,</font>

34:53.045 --> 34:57.463
<font color="#ffff00">to shake my hand, with no
apology, or explanation,</font>

34:57.630 --> 35:01.588
<font color="#ffff00">SuperBob is a weapon that Britain
has no control over.</font>

35:01.713 --> 35:03.813
<font color="#ffff00">Where is he today?</font>

35:20.921 --> 35:23.021
<font color="#ffff00">I don't like dancing.</font>

35:23.963 --> 35:26.213
<font color="#ffff00">No, I don't have to...
- dance with your girlfiend!</font>

35:26.338 --> 35:30.338
<font color="#ffff00">No, that's why we're a good couple,
She knows I don't dance.</font>

35:33.963 --> 35:36.671
<font color="#ffff00">Is this... this is dancing, isn't it?</font>

35:37.463 --> 35:40.588
<font color="#ffff00">No, come on. This is less embarrassing.</font>

35:59.671 --> 36:02.563
<font color="#ffff00">Is it weird with Javier?
 - Why?</font>

36:02.688 --> 36:04.755
<font color="#ffff00">Because you use to go out.</font>

36:04.880 --> 36:09.963
<font color="#ffff00">Why would it be weird? It was
months ago, it was just fun.</font>

36:10.796 --> 36:12.921
<font color="#ffff00">You're probably disgusted.</font>

36:14.088 --> 36:17.338
<font color="#ffff00">I am sorry.  About what I said earlier.</font>

36:17.671 --> 36:20.171
<font color="#ffff00">It's OK, you're not normal.</font>

36:20.546 --> 36:26.130
<font color="#ffff00">I'm just jealous. Maybe I
wish I could be more like you.</font>

36:26.588 --> 36:28.688
<font color="#ffff00">You already apologized.</font>

36:29.713 --> 36:32.463
<font color="#ffff00">What's this? - It's the psychic paper.</font>

36:32.630 --> 36:35.046
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, the psychic paper, is it?</font>

36:35.246 --> 36:39.446
<font color="#ffff00">"Doris is better than I will ever be.
I am sorry I was ever rude to her,</font>

36:39.571 --> 36:42.463
<font color="#ffff00">She's the greatest, I am
an idiot, Bob Kenner."</font>

36:42.588 --> 36:44.671
<font color="#ffff00">That's interesting.</font>

36:44.796 --> 36:49.046
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. How come your English
is so much better on paper?</font>

38:28.255 --> 38:31.505
<font color="#ffff00">It's June. I should take this.</font>

38:31.838 --> 38:34.380
<font color="#ffff00">Tell her you dance like a fucking idiot.</font>

38:34.505 --> 38:36.963
<font color="#ffff00">Hello? June...</font>

38:42.338 --> 38:47.421
<font color="#ffff00">No, I honestly, I waited for ages,
then I had to go because my Mum, and...</font>

38:47.546 --> 38:49.646
<font color="#ffff00">So it was broken?</font>

38:50.005 --> 38:53.630
<font color="#ffff00">Well, of course. Of course I'm still keen,</font>

38:54.005 --> 38:56.630
<font color="#ffff00">I'm too keen, I'm...</font>

38:58.255 --> 39:01.588
<font color="#ffff00">I've been making you something.
It's embarrasing.</font>

39:03.421 --> 39:07.088
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, you could see it, if you want.
It's at my house.</font>

39:10.213 --> 39:15.421
<font color="#ffff00">Yes. Yeah. Yeah, that would be great.</font>

39:15.921 --> 39:18.021
<font color="#ffff00">That's a great idea.</font>

39:18.921 --> 39:21.505
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, you come to my house. For dinner.</font>

39:23.546 --> 39:26.130
<font color="#ffff00">All right. I'm a tremendous cook.</font>

39:26.963 --> 39:32.046
<font color="#ffff00">Okay. see you later.
All right. Goodbye.</font>

39:41.796 --> 39:43.921
<font color="#ffff00">We are joined now by Theresa Ford</font>

39:44.046 --> 39:47.846
<font color="#ffff00">Head of the Global Emergency Response
Department at the Ministry of Defense.</font>

39:47.971 --> 39:52.255
<font color="#ffff00">Theresa, do you really thing that SuperBob -
- Excuse me, why won't SuperBob shake my hand?</font>

39:52.380 --> 39:54.546
<font color="#ffff00">Does he hold a grudge against the United States?</font>

39:54.671 --> 39:58.338
<font color="#ffff00">SuperBob does not hold any resentment against anyone.</font>

39:58.463 --> 40:00.755
<font color="#ffff00">He is a very warm and kind man.</font>

40:00.880 --> 40:05.546
<font color="#ffff00">You have no control over SuperBob.
- Of course I do.</font>

40:05.671 --> 40:09.671
<font color="#ffff00">All right, where was he today?
- He was resting, Senator Jackson, in accordance...</font>

40:09.796 --> 40:16.171
<font color="#ffff00">SuperBob hates America. - SuperBob
does not hate America, SuperBob loves America.</font>

40:16.296 --> 40:19.046
<font color="#ffff00">He loves your country, he loves your culture.</font>

40:19.338 --> 40:22.213
<font color="#ffff00">Plinky plonky, country and western,
he can't get enough of it.</font>

40:22.338 --> 40:26.546
<font color="#ffff00">You know, big shoulder pads.
American football.</font>

40:26.671 --> 40:30.255
<font color="#ffff00">Men with cagey, head helmut hats.</font>

40:30.380 --> 40:33.880
<font color="#ffff00">Peanut butter and jelly.</font>

40:34.046 --> 40:36.713
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, my Bob and Doris are now a couple.</font>

40:37.130 --> 40:39.230
<font color="#ffff00">I do not believe it.</font>

40:43.005 --> 40:47.296
<font color="#ffff00">Why is your Momma going around telling everybody that
you are a couple for? You're not her type.</font>

40:47.421 --> 40:53.963
<font color="#ffff00">Doris like the strong, assertive,
virile type. You know, the Javier type.</font>

40:57.296 --> 41:00.588
<font color="#ffff00">Well, maybe I impressed her.</font>

41:00.963 --> 41:03.380
<font color="#ffff00">Yes. How did you impress me?</font>

41:05.713 --> 41:07.755
<font color="#ffff00">Without being arrogant,</font>

41:07.880 --> 41:10.963
<font color="#ffff00">I am a superhero. I mean, that's...</font>

41:11.088 --> 41:14.005
<font color="#ffff00">I never think of you as a superhero.
- You never think of me as a superhero?</font>

41:14.130 --> 41:17.463
<font color="#ffff00">Never.
- Okay, well, not that, then.</font>

41:17.588 --> 41:21.505
<font color="#ffff00">So... how the two of you get together?</font>

41:21.713 --> 41:26.421
<font color="#ffff00">Just the usual. Just...
Doris asked me out, and...</font>

41:26.546 --> 41:28.630
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't ask you out! You asked me out.</font>

41:28.755 --> 41:34.422
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, I don't remember exaclty, it doesn't matter.
- It doesn't matter? Oh, come on, Bob, it's romantic.</font>

41:34.921 --> 41:38.713
<font color="#ffff00">Bob has been obsessed with me for a
long time. - Obsessed is a strong word.</font>

41:38.838 --> 41:40.838
<font color="#ffff00">Always watching me around the house.</font>

41:40.963 --> 41:44.821
<font color="#ffff00">I'm always waiting for me to pick up something
from the floor so he could look at my ass.</font>

41:44.946 --> 41:47.938
<font color="#ffff00">I wouldn't... I didn't do that because I'm a feminist.
- When I say he likes my ass...</font>

41:48.063 --> 41:50.155
<font color="#ffff00">I don't like you ass, I've never looked at it.
- You do not like her ass?</font>

41:50.280 --> 41:55.255
<font color="#ffff00">Always watching me eat bananas.
- Have you seen her eat a banana?
She eats bananas with the skin on,</font>

41:55.380 --> 41:59.713
<font color="#ffff00">Of course I watch, it's weird.
- And then after a few weeks I came in,</font>

41:59.838 --> 42:02.755
<font color="#ffff00"> and the whole house smells of patchouli oil. Didn't it, Bob?</font>

42:02.880 --> 42:08.463
<font color="#ffff00">Yep.
-  And Bob is standing there in this big, pink, Ong.</font>

42:08.588 --> 42:13.430
<font color="#ffff00">Was it one of mine? - What?
'E was like that when he was younger.
Always stealing my knickers.</font>

42:13.555 --> 42:17.413
<font color="#ffff00">Mum, when are you going to let that go?
It was once, and I was four.</font>

42:17.538 --> 42:21.705
<font color="#ffff00">It doesn't matter how old you were.
You still stole my knickers.
- I did not steal you knickers, Mum!</font>

42:21.830 --> 42:25.838
<font color="#ffff00">Why would you stole your mother's knickers?
- I didn't steal her knickers!
- Sounds lke you stole her knickers.</font>

42:25.963 --> 42:30.963
<font color="#ffff00">All right! I stole her knickers, Is everyone happy?
Can we move on?</font>

42:31.380 --> 42:34.380
<font color="#ffff00">Do you feel better now, Bobby?
-Yes.</font>

42:34.880 --> 42:38.255
<font color="#ffff00">So there we were, in the kitchen,
and I said to Doris...</font>

42:38.380 --> 42:41.171
<font color="#ffff00">Four words.
- Four words.</font>

42:41.588 --> 42:46.130
<font color="#ffff00">Four perfect words.
- Of course they were perfect, I said...</font>

42:46.255 --> 42:48.355
<font color="#ffff00">I said...</font>

42:49.338 --> 42:51.380
<font color="#ffff00">"You complete me, Doris."</font>

42:51.505 --> 42:55.796
<font color="#ffff00">No,silly, that is from a film! - From a film. I said,
- Come on! - I said... - What did you say?</font>

42:55.921 --> 42:59.546
<font color="#ffff00">I said, "Nobody puts Baby..."
I didn't say that, it sounds a git,</font>

42:59.671 --> 43:04.213
<font color="#ffff00">I said, "I love your face.
I love your face!"</font>

43:04.338 --> 43:09.296
<font color="#ffff00">That is what  said. Because it was poignant.
- Isn't he adorable? - He's not my type.</font>

43:24.838 --> 43:28.963
<font color="#ffff00">We have a major accident with multiple
vehicles on the A205 westbound</font>

43:29.088 --> 43:31.188
<font color="#ffff00">Answer, please.</font>

43:36.005 --> 43:38.171
<font color="#ffff00">multiple vehicles, multiple injured.</font>

43:38.296 --> 43:40.396
<font color="#ffff00">I'd better...</font>

43:51.838 --> 43:55.380
<font color="#ffff00">Senator Jackson, I have complete
control over Bob's movemenst.</font>

43:55.505 --> 43:57.871
<font color="#ffff00">You have no
- I know where he is, at all times.</font>

43:57.996 --> 44:04.255
<font color="#ffff00">I'm terribly sorry to have to interrupt you there, but we're
getting reports of a large car crash in South London,</font>

44:04.380 --> 44:08.046
<font color="#ffff00">SuperBob is actually reported to be on the scene.
Which if true, Theresa,</font>

44:08.171 --> 44:14.088
<font color="#ffff00">would be a direct contravention of his
UN sanctioned Tuesday day off. Would it not?</font>

44:14.213 --> 44:18.171
<font color="#ffff00">Well, it would if, if...
- Well, it would, wouldn't it?</font>

44:18.296 --> 44:23.963
<font color="#ffff00">This, this is exactly what I am talking about,
- I have to go... - He is not allowed to...
- Start the bloody chopper!</font>

44:25.338 --> 44:27.755
<font color="#ffff00">He is not allowed to work on Tuesdays!</font>

44:28.380 --> 44:32.505
<font color="#ffff00">Rogue WMD. We are at their mercy.</font>

44:36.213 --> 44:38.313
<font color="#ffff00">Help, please!</font>

44:39.296 --> 44:44.880
<font color="#ffff00">She's got a puncture to her left lung.
- Get out of here now. This has nothing to do with the MOD.</font>

44:45.880 --> 44:49.896
<font color="#ffff00">I can help.
- You cannot work on your day off, that is the law.</font>

44:50.021 --> 44:52.921
<font color="#ffff00">You have to be seen to be following orders.
Bob!</font>

44:56.963 --> 45:00.338
<font color="#ffff00">Do not disobey your government.</font>

45:03.588 --> 45:06.505
<font color="#ffff00">Do not disobey <i>me</i>, Bob.</font>

45:07.421 --> 45:09.921
<font color="#ffff00">Walk. Away.</font>

45:10.296 --> 45:14.213
<font color="#ffff00">Help me! Please, help me!
- Don't do it, Bob.</font>

45:40.296 --> 45:42.396
<font color="#ffff00">It's OK.</font>

45:43.671 --> 45:45.771
<font color="#ffff00">It's all right.</font>

46:47.171 --> 46:51.755
<font color="#ffff00">He just let that woman die.
- He doesn't have psychic powers, Senator. He's just a man.</font>

46:51.880 --> 46:55.046
<font color="#ffff00">He is not just a man.</font>

46:55.171 --> 46:58.921
<font color="#ffff00">He has these powers and they
should be used in the right way.</font>

46:59.046 --> 47:04.088
<font color="#ffff00">You people are sitting on the greatest
discovery of this century and you are squandering it.</font>

47:04.630 --> 47:11.921
<font color="#ffff00">Why is Great Britain allowed an unsanctioined WMD
while the rest of us just got to sit around and wait
and see what he is gonna snap?</font>

47:22.000 --> 47:24.900
<font color="#ffff00">Bob...
-  Sorry, I forgot my keys.</font>

47:25.000 --> 47:27.958
<font color="#ffff00">No, no, that's fine. I was in
the area buying lemons.</font>

47:30.000 --> 47:32.150
<font color="#ffff00">Listen, I didn't get them, when we were in the care home</font>

47:32.213 --> 47:35.788
<font color="#ffff00">Javier got into this big argument with Tomas
for waking him up for lunch.</font>

47:35.913 --> 47:38.463
<font color="#ffff00">That is because he has his clock fast.</font>

47:38.588 --> 47:41.171
<font color="#ffff00">And then when we gave him the food, he said...</font>

47:41.296 --> 47:44.380
<font color="#ffff00">He complained about the food, he said
he would only eat cake.</font>

47:44.505 --> 47:46.963
<font color="#ffff00">But you know this makes
him hyperactive.</font>

47:47.088 --> 47:52.880
<font color="#ffff00">Do you remember Nora? The one with the harelip?
She likes to be the one to put out the cutlery.</font>

47:53.213 --> 47:55.880
<font color="#ffff00">And the cutlery wasn't there.</font>

47:56.713 --> 48:02.755
<font color="#ffff00">So, Nora went absolutlely insane
And Javier was like,</font>

48:04.171 --> 48:06.921
<font color="#ffff00">I have always emptied the dishwasher!</font>

48:07.046 --> 48:10.296
<font color="#ffff00">There is no reason to believe I would forget
to do it this afternoon!</font>

48:10.421 --> 48:14.421
<font color="#ffff00">Why? Why today? Explain to me
why today I would have forgotten it.</font>

48:14.588 --> 48:16.688
<font color="#ffff00">It was really tough today.</font>

48:21.838 --> 48:23.938
<font color="#ffff00">Really tough.</font>

48:51.130 --> 48:53.380
<font color="#ffff00">It's always tough.</font>

49:11.130 --> 49:13.796
<font color="#ffff00">How ya, Barry? - Hi, Barry.</font>

49:14.005 --> 49:16.505
<font color="#ffff00">I'll go and have a bath, then.</font>

49:24.755 --> 49:27.880
<font color="#ffff00">Who is this?
- Shit, it's June.</font>

49:28.963 --> 49:32.005
<font color="#ffff00">Why is she here?
- She's coming for dinner.</font>

49:33.505 --> 49:35.605
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, I see.</font>

49:37.130 --> 49:42.213
<font color="#ffff00">Go. - I'm going to...
- To your room, go to your room. You have to clean up.</font>

49:45.646 --> 49:49.380
<font color="#ffff00">Bari, please get out, I have to shower.
- I ain't finished yet.</font>

49:49.505 --> 49:52.255
<font color="#ffff00">Can you move up?</font>

49:57.005 --> 49:59.255
<font color="#ffff00">Good evening, June.
- Hey.</font>

49:59.588 --> 50:03.163
<font color="#ffff00">Welcome to Bob's house.
I'm Doris, I work here. -Hello.</font>

50:03.288 --> 50:06.588
<font color="#ffff00">Please come in. Well come.
-Thank you.</font>

50:08.380 --> 50:13.005
<font color="#ffff00">May I present,
Bob Kenner.</font>

50:13.880 --> 50:16.421
<font color="#ffff00">Doris, don't make a deal of it.</font>

50:18.380 --> 50:21.171
<font color="#ffff00">You look really handsome. -Thank you.</font>

50:21.755 --> 50:24.838
<font color="#ffff00">Hi. - Hi. How are you?</font>

50:26.088 --> 50:30.130
<font color="#ffff00">Okay. I'll leave your papers there.
Do you have your keys?</font>

50:30.546 --> 50:34.730
<font color="#ffff00">Yep. -Do you need something?
-Nope.</font>

50:35.588 --> 50:38.463
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, Mind the door! -  Are you all right?
-Easy, I mind the door. I'm fine.</font>

50:38.588 --> 50:42.463
<font color="#ffff00">Did you bang your head? - No, I'm fine.
Are you bleeding?  - No, I'm fine.</font>

50:42.588 --> 50:44.688
<font color="#ffff00">Have fun.</font>

50:49.171 --> 50:51.271
<font color="#ffff00">You do look very nice.</font>

50:51.796 --> 50:56.338
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you. So do you, you
look very... green.</font>

50:57.046 --> 50:59.921
<font color="#ffff00">Green?
- like a good green.</font>

51:00.046 --> 51:02.146
<font color="#ffff00">Okay.</font>

51:02.630 --> 51:04.755
<font color="#ffff00">Can you hang on a second?
Just one second.</font>

51:04.880 --> 51:08.046
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. - I promise I'll be quick.
-Okay.</font>

51:20.130 --> 51:22.230
<font color="#ffff00">Okay.
- Okay.</font>

51:22.838 --> 51:25.796
<font color="#ffff00">Let's do this.
Let's do a date.</font>

51:30.046 --> 51:33.963
<font color="#ffff00">Right, you sit down...
Okay.</font>

51:34.671 --> 51:37.463
<font color="#ffff00">Oh my God!
What's the smell?</font>

51:38.005 --> 51:41.630
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, I'll open it. Ready?</font>

51:52.796 --> 51:57.796
<font color="#ffff00">Ugh! Ugh! Is that manure?
-No, that... It's leaves.</font>

51:59.380 --> 52:03.380
<font color="#ffff00">Right, leaves...
- And what they're made into.</font>

52:06.838 --> 52:10.963
<font color="#ffff00">I do not know.
- Okay, why's it got windows?</font>

52:11.130 --> 52:13.171
<font color="#ffff00">Are those windows? -Yeah.</font>

52:13.296 --> 52:18.338
<font color="#ffff00">That looks like maggots. -No, that's not a...
That's a house. A house.</font>

52:20.963 --> 52:23.063
<font color="#ffff00">House of leaves!</font>

52:25.130 --> 52:27.230
<font color="#ffff00">The House of Leaves.</font>

52:27.713 --> 52:29.813
<font color="#ffff00">The House of Leaves.</font>

52:32.255 --> 52:34.355
<font color="#ffff00">I love it. - Good.</font>

52:34.880 --> 52:38.296
<font color="#ffff00">Um-hm. I really love it, it's very sweet..
- Good.</font>

52:38.463 --> 52:42.296
<font color="#ffff00">Oh my God, I love it!  - Great.
Why House of Leaves?</font>

52:42.421 --> 52:46.288
<font color="#ffff00">It's your favorite book.
- My favorite book is "House of Cards".</font>

52:46.413 --> 52:48.513
<font color="#ffff00">That is so much easier.</font>

52:49.046 --> 52:51.963
<font color="#ffff00">That is, that is amazing.</font>

52:54.588 --> 52:57.071
<font color="#ffff00">I'm glad you ate your noodles.</font>

52:57.196 --> 53:00.338
<font color="#ffff00">You ate loads.
Look at how much you ate, here.</font>

53:00.463 --> 53:04.046
<font color="#ffff00">You're gonna be full. Yeah.
- Very full.</font>

53:04.171 --> 53:06.880
<font color="#ffff00">You're going to be bloated. -Yeah.</font>

53:07.755 --> 53:10.671
<font color="#ffff00">Are you comfortable with, like, farting?</font>

53:11.463 --> 53:17.296
<font color="#ffff00">Excuse me? - You know, like, if I winded you?
- Like a baby? - Yeah.</font>

53:17.755 --> 53:22.505
<font color="#ffff00">Uh.. I... No.
No, oh, you were joking. - Yeah.</font>

53:22.630 --> 53:25.463
<font color="#ffff00">That would really upset me.
- It really would upset me...</font>

53:25.671 --> 53:30.130
<font color="#ffff00">Okay. - I mean, not that much, because I'd be
totally cool with it, if you wanted to, but...</font>

53:30.255 --> 53:34.213
<font color="#ffff00">I really don't want you to wind me
like a baby and make me fart.</font>

53:40.546 --> 53:45.255
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, it was everywhere, so we had to
cover the stain with a pile of books,</font>

53:45.380 --> 53:49.130
<font color="#ffff00">But the guy he couldn't even see anyway,
so we totally got away with it.</font>

53:49.255 --> 53:52.380
<font color="#ffff00">Just. -That is amazing. -Yeah.</font>

53:52.505 --> 53:56.046
<font color="#ffff00">That's crazy times.</font>

54:03.588 --> 54:06.421
<font color="#ffff00">I have a cleaner for things like that.</font>

54:07.505 --> 54:10.338
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, you mentioned.</font>

54:13.671 --> 54:15.880
<font color="#ffff00">What would you have used? - Me?</font>

54:16.005 --> 54:19.588
<font color="#ffff00">If you had to? To get out the stain?
What would you have used?</font>

54:21.046 --> 54:25.088
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know. - Okay.
Like a powder?</font>

54:26.796 --> 54:29.005
<font color="#ffff00">Or a spray?</font>

54:31.421 --> 54:34.921
<font color="#ffff00">Or mousse? A mousse thing?</font>

54:39.630 --> 54:42.213
<font color="#ffff00">You really can't get drunk?</font>

54:42.546 --> 54:45.088
<font color="#ffff00">It's to do with my veins, they are imperveous.</font>

54:45.213 --> 54:47.313
<font color="#ffff00"> Impervious.
- Um hm.</font>

54:48.255 --> 54:50.838
<font color="#ffff00"> Im perrrr vious.</font>

54:51.096 --> 54:53.963
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. -I'm gonna get impervious
with you, you filthy animal.</font>

54:54.088 --> 54:57.171
<font color="#ffff00">Can I get you some water?
Can I get you some of this?</font>

54:57.421 --> 54:59.671
<font color="#ffff00">Ooh, I like your drapes.</font>

55:04.213 --> 55:10.213
<font color="#ffff00">Bob! You are with British Gas! Don't
let those fuckers push you around. Doris.</font>

55:31.046 --> 55:33.146
<font color="#ffff00">June... - Yeah?</font>

55:35.296 --> 55:38.296
<font color="#ffff00">You're a really lovely woman, and you're beautiful.</font>

55:38.880 --> 55:40.980
<font color="#ffff00">Thanks.</font>

55:41.213 --> 55:44.005
<font color="#ffff00">You're not so bad yourself, SuperBob.</font>

55:45.255 --> 55:48.380
<font color="#ffff00">I thought you were gonna be one of those people</font>

55:48.505 --> 55:51.421
<font color="#ffff00">who was like, above everyone else.</font>

55:52.255 --> 55:55.296
<font color="#ffff00">You know.  Because you can fly.</font>

55:57.171 --> 56:01.963
<font color="#ffff00">But you're not. You're real, like me.</font>

56:03.421 --> 56:06.171
<font color="#ffff00">Will you kiss me?
- I can't.</font>

56:07.255 --> 56:12.321
<font color="#ffff00">Why? We already did.
- I'm sorry, I can't do this - Do what? It's just a kiss.</font>

56:12.446 --> 56:15.746
<font color="#ffff00">I can't continue with this date,
it wouldn't be right.</font>

56:15.871 --> 56:20.088
<font color="#ffff00">It's nothing that you've done. I don't
want to take advantage of you.</font>

56:20.213 --> 56:23.088
<font color="#ffff00">I don't mind.
- I want to take advantage of Doris.</font>

56:23.213 --> 56:26.630
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't mean it like that, I want...</font>

56:28.171 --> 56:32.880
<font color="#ffff00">What I mean is, I want to be with</font>

56:34.546 --> 56:36.646
<font color="#ffff00">Doris.</font>

56:36.838 --> 56:39.005
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, just kiss her, you fuckng plank.</font>

56:39.130 --> 56:43.630
<font color="#ffff00">Barry, I didn't ask for your input.
- She's fit. - I like Doris.</font>

56:43.755 --> 56:45.855
<font color="#ffff00">Very fit.</font>

56:46.046 --> 56:49.296
<font color="#ffff00">Where have you been all night?
- I'm keeping me eye on the gnomes.</font>

56:49.421 --> 56:53.171
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't know I had gnomes.
- Yeah, you've got two.</font>

56:54.880 --> 56:57.671
<font color="#ffff00">June, listen.
- Bob, what I...</font>

56:59.421 --> 57:01.713
<font color="#ffff00">Oh my god. They're here.</font>

57:01.838 --> 57:04.588
<font color="#ffff00">Who's here?
- Uh, How does my hair look?</font>

57:04.713 --> 57:10.463
<font color="#ffff00">Your hair looks fine, why? Who's here?
- Shoes. Ok Ok.</font>

57:11.171 --> 57:13.880
<font color="#ffff00">Good evening, Bob.
- Hello. - June...</font>

57:14.005 --> 57:17.963
<font color="#ffff00">Now, have you finished all your paperwork?
- Let's go, darling, let's get you dressed. - Darling? -Off</font>

57:18.088 --> 57:20.880
<font color="#ffff00">Are we going somewhere? - Oh yes.
Why is she calling me darling? Sorry...</font>

57:21.005 --> 57:24.713
<font color="#ffff00">I just... didn't I just say something?
- Don't mind me - You didn't hear.</font>

57:25.171 --> 57:29.713
<font color="#ffff00">Okay. His hands are down my pants, why is that happening?
- Just enjoy it, babe.</font>

57:29.838 --> 57:33.130
<font color="#ffff00">Why am I wearing this?
- It's the internationally approved uniform, Bob.</font>

57:33.255 --> 57:38.255
<font color="#ffff00">They approved this? -Yes. - Were they blindfolded?
- We have to show willing, okay, it's time to make ties.</font>

57:38.838 --> 57:41.880
<font color="#ffff00">Yes. I'm aware it sounds strange. She
told me not to make it to that lunch.</font>

57:42.005 --> 57:45.421
<font color="#ffff00">Theresa told you not to come?
- That you wouldn't make it, and that we would
go to this thing tonight.</font>

57:45.546 --> 57:47.857
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, so I don't even know what this is.
I don't have time for any of this...</font>

57:47.982 --> 57:50.963
<font color="#ffff00">I've got to do the most important
thing I've ever done.</font>

57:51.088 --> 57:53.463
<font color="#ffff00">Teresa, why am I here?
- It doesn't matter.</font>

57:53.588 --> 57:57.180
<font color="#ffff00">What's going on, why am I dressed
like a New Romantic?</font>

57:57.305 --> 58:01.346
<font color="#ffff00">June told me you stopped her from coming
to lunch, she told me everything.</font>

58:01.471 --> 58:03.505
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, I have pulled a lot of strings today,</font>

58:03.630 --> 58:07.405
<font color="#ffff00">Do you have any idea the nightmare
your "No" stunt has caused me?</font>

58:07.530 --> 58:10.005
<font color="#ffff00">Theresa, we need to talk about this.</font>

58:10.130 --> 58:15.213
<font color="#ffff00">I spoke to June, yes.
For the greater good, okay? And it's all fine.</font>

58:15.630 --> 58:17.713
<font color="#ffff00">Is it?</font>

58:17.838 --> 58:24.338
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, Bob. We're good at this.
This is what we do.</font>

58:26.130 --> 58:28.230
<font color="#ffff00">We save the world.</font>

58:41.535 --> 58:44.046
<font color="#ffff00">Bob, this is Xiang Chao
from the Chinese Senate.</font>

58:44.171 --> 58:47.263
<font color="#ffff00">He's here to talk about a set-down
on nuclear policies.</font>

58:47.388 --> 58:49.588
<font color="#ffff00">Nice to meet you. Yeah, ciao. - I'm pleased to.</font>

58:49.713 --> 58:52.505
<font color="#ffff00">George Pardumo from Greece.
- Please to meet you..</font>

58:52.630 --> 58:55.005
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, it's nice to....</font>

58:55.130 --> 58:59.296
<font color="#ffff00">Theresa, this is not an explanation.
-Dane Abudaui.</font>

58:59.755 --> 59:04.671
<font color="#ffff00">Hello, Dane. - Are you in a mood?
Yeah, I'm in a mood, because you told me...
- Dallas Tango.</font>

59:04.796 --> 59:07.588
<font color="#ffff00">What? - Super to meet you
- Nice to meet you. - What do you mean, "what"?</font>

59:07.713 --> 59:11.130
<font color="#ffff00">This is the French Senator
Eleusi Savoir.</font>

59:11.671 --> 59:15.546
<font color="#ffff00">Enchante. - We knew that you liked June, Bob.
It was obvious to anyone</font>

59:15.671 --> 59:19.171
<font color="#ffff00">All that haning around the library...
- So you manupulated it. - I did not.  No.</font>

59:19.296 --> 59:24.046
<font color="#ffff00">She really does like you, just take a look.
- It's true, I do. - Are you all right?</font>

59:24.546 --> 59:26.630
<font color="#ffff00">There's nothing sinister going on here, Bob.</font>

59:26.755 --> 59:30.088
<font color="#ffff00">I just needed to make sure that she was OK.
I''m just looking out for you.</font>

59:30.213 --> 59:33.838
<font color="#ffff00">It's not looking out for me if you make her
go out with me. It's not real.</font>

59:33.963 --> 59:35.988
<font color="#ffff00">You are sounding paranoid.</font>

59:36.113 --> 59:40.213
<font color="#ffff00">Well, she did ask me to ask you out.
But I would have asked you out anyway.</font>

59:40.338 --> 59:44.788
<font color="#ffff00">Stand down, June, just stand down and smile.
- Oh, so, there you go Theresa, this has to stop.
I need my own life back.</font>

59:44.913 --> 59:48.171
<font color="#ffff00">This is the dignitary from
Rome, Giuseppe Kotelo.</font>

59:48.671 --> 59:52.588
<font color="#ffff00">Good evening. - Bona Sera.
-Thank you.</font>

59:52.713 --> 59:58.171
<font color="#ffff00">I really think you should give June a chance she really
does have an awfull lot to recommend her. - I want Doris.</font>

59:58.463 --> 01:00:03.046
<font color="#ffff00">What? -My cleaner.
-I know who she is, Bob.</font>

01:00:03.171 --> 01:00:05.546
<font color="#ffff00">Come and shake the hand...
- Don't. Nevermind.</font>

01:00:05.713 --> 01:00:10.588
<font color="#ffff00">I've decided. If she will let me,
I want to be with Doris.</font>

01:00:10.755 --> 01:00:15.088
<font color="#ffff00">Ah! This is Doris?
-No, this is not Doris. -Yes!</font>

01:00:18.796 --> 01:00:22.588
<font color="#ffff00">Doris is from Colombia.
You just can't be with anyone from Colombia.</font>

01:00:22.713 --> 01:00:24.921
<font color="#ffff00">Why not? -It's complicated.</font>

01:00:25.588 --> 01:00:28.755
<font color="#ffff00">And she's a cleaner.
It's really not the right narrative.</font>

01:00:29.505 --> 01:00:33.421
<font color="#ffff00">You should be with June.
June's fun. And she's American.</font>

01:00:33.546 --> 01:00:36.380
<font color="#ffff00">But I don't want to be with June.
- Bob, she's right there.</font>

01:00:36.505 --> 01:00:39.505
<font color="#ffff00">It's fine, I've told her.
-It's fine.</font>

01:00:39.963 --> 01:00:43.838
<font color="#ffff00">Are you all right?
- Okay, you don't have to be with her, Bob.</font>

01:00:43.963 --> 01:00:49.546
<font color="#ffff00">You just have to stand near her sometimes.
It's what we need. -Who is "we"?</font>

01:00:49.671 --> 01:00:55.296
<font color="#ffff00">The United Kingdom. Great Britain.
The MOD. You. All of us.</font>

01:00:55.421 --> 01:01:00.588
<font color="#ffff00">Now you need to start listening to me again. It was a very
bad decision you made not to shake hands with the Senator.</font>

01:01:00.713 --> 01:01:03.130
<font color="#ffff00">Alexis Sanjiv, this is SuperBob.</font>

01:01:03.255 --> 01:01:07.046
<font color="#ffff00">Okay so thats what this is about. All right.
Okay, thank you.</font>

01:01:07.713 --> 01:01:10.588
<font color="#ffff00">Sometimes saving the world isn't
 about flying into danger,</font>

01:01:10.713 --> 01:01:13.463
<font color="#ffff00">Sometimes it's about making sacrifices of your own.</font>

01:01:13.588 --> 01:01:16.505
<font color="#ffff00">Do you have any idea the sacrifices I've made?</font>

01:01:16.921 --> 01:01:21.296
<font color="#ffff00">Let's go. - June! Seriously. I do not know
how I could make this any clearer. This is weird.</font>

01:01:21.421 --> 01:01:26.255
<font color="#ffff00">Do I not get to have love?
-June, could you just give us a moment please?
-Yes, of course.</font>

01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:30.588
<font color="#ffff00">Let's talk about Doris. -Please.</font>

01:01:30.713 --> 01:01:35.505
<font color="#ffff00">Do you know what is right for her? -Yes.
- Not you, what is right for Doris. -Yes, of course I do.</font>

01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:38.005
<font color="#ffff00">What does she want, Bob? -She wants...</font>

01:01:39.255 --> 01:01:42.713
<font color="#ffff00">She wants a nursery in Colombia, that is
what she's always wanted.</font>

01:01:45.963 --> 01:01:48.038
<font color="#ffff00">And this is Colonel Matayzu.</font>

01:01:48.163 --> 01:01:51.671
<font color="#ffff00">Bob, Bob, Bob...
It is an honor to meet you.</font>

01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:57.380
<font color="#ffff00">We are so looking forward to having your help
in combating the uprising in our country.</font>

01:01:57.505 --> 01:02:02.672
<font color="#ffff00">Why am I here, Theresa?  - Bob, what do you
think this Weapons Summit is about?</font>

01:02:04.671 --> 01:02:09.005
<font color="#ffff00">I hadn't seen that. - You're the only
weapon anyone cares about.</font>

01:02:10.796 --> 01:02:13.255
<font color="#ffff00">And this is Senator Jackson.</font>

01:02:13.921 --> 01:02:19.630
<font color="#ffff00">Bob Kenner! I am so pleased
you've decided to play ball, and</font>

01:02:20.255 --> 01:02:25.255
<font color="#ffff00">Obviously I'm delighted to hear about your
union to this lovely American lady.</font>

01:02:27.171 --> 01:02:29.838
<font color="#ffff00">Is this the man who needed a handshake earlier today?</font>

01:02:29.963 --> 01:02:32.338
<font color="#ffff00">Well, yeah, but we're all good now.</font>

01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:38.880
<font color="#ffff00">Ha, ha, ha, yeah, right. So, wait -
So all of this, all of this is so you can have a handshake?</font>

01:02:40.838 --> 01:02:42.938
<font color="#ffff00">Is that right?</font>

01:02:45.088 --> 01:02:47.188
<font color="#ffff00">Okay.</font>

01:02:47.838 --> 01:02:49.880
<font color="#ffff00">Ha, ha, ha, there ya go.</font>

01:02:50.005 --> 01:02:52.013
<font color="#ffff00">Was it worth it?</font>

01:02:52.138 --> 01:02:56.138
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, I am so glad we could sort
out that Colombia situation.</font>

01:02:58.130 --> 01:03:00.796
<font color="#ffff00">What Colombia situation? - Your cleaner.</font>

01:03:01.088 --> 01:03:06.880
<font color="#ffff00">We bought her a nursery! And a first class
ticket for Bogota, next flight.</font>

01:03:11.046 --> 01:03:15.171
<font color="#ffff00">You sent her away?
- It's what you wanted, right?</font>

01:03:16.213 --> 01:03:19.963
<font color="#ffff00">Are you joking? - I thought you said you
wanted what was right for her, Bob.</font>

01:03:20.088 --> 01:03:23.505
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, he wants what's right for all
of us, don't you, Bob?</font>

01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:26.630
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. Just like you wanted a handshake.</font>

01:03:26.755 --> 01:03:31.338
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, everybody is here to broker a real
sweet deal for you, Bob.</font>

01:03:31.463 --> 01:03:34.255
<font color="#ffff00">This is gonna be a lot of money
in it for you.</font>

01:03:34.463 --> 01:03:38.880
<font color="#ffff00">I'm just shaking your hand.
Just like you wanted.</font>

01:03:39.255 --> 01:03:43.546
<font color="#ffff00">Bob. - And SuperBob, our very
own Bob Kenner is here today...</font>

01:03:43.671 --> 01:03:46.005
<font color="#ffff00">Is this the handshake you wanted?</font>

01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:49.963
<font color="#ffff00">Boe Kenner! Put Senator
Jackson down now!</font>

01:03:50.421 --> 01:03:53.671
<font color="#ffff00">It is supposed to be my day off!</font>

01:04:00.013 --> 01:04:03.355
<font color="#ffff00">I don't care if you bring him down
or not, just shoot the bastard!</font>

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:07.030
<font color="#ffff00">Uncomfirmed reports are coming in about
an explosion at the Ministry of Defense.</font>

01:04:07.155 --> 01:04:09.163
<font color="#ffff00">The explosion at the Ministry of Defence
was caused by SuperBob...</font>

01:04:09.288 --> 01:04:12.213
<font color="#ffff00">London is tonight on high alert
as Superbob...</font>

01:04:12.338 --> 01:04:16.930
<font color="#ffff00">Police and military forces around the world are
combining their efforts to track down SuperBob.</font>

01:04:17.055 --> 01:04:19.288
<font color="#ffff00">... we have not lost
control of SuperBob.</font>

01:04:19.413 --> 01:04:21.788
<font color="#ffff00">Everyone is to stay calm,
and  not jump to conclusions.</font>

01:04:21.913 --> 01:04:24.671
<font color="#ffff00">Right. So, where exactly is he?
- I can't tell you that.</font>

01:04:24.796 --> 01:04:29.171
<font color="#ffff00">There have been uncomfirmed sightings of SuperBob
in New York, Tokyo, Bogotá...</font>

01:04:30.588 --> 01:04:34.630
<font color="#ffff00">I'm looking for somebody, her name is Doris.
She'll be on a flight from England.</font>

01:04:34.755 --> 01:04:38.046
<font color="#ffff00">Uh, what is her last name?
- Ohhh... that is something I should know.</font>

01:04:40.546 --> 01:04:44.671
<font color="#ffff00">My Mum would know. Can I call my Mum?
Guh! I know where she is!</font>

01:04:45.255 --> 01:04:48.588
<font color="#ffff00">My man said he heard mumbling about someone called Morris.
- ...said he was screaming "Forrest!"</font>

01:04:48.713 --> 01:04:52.546
<font color="#ffff00">...apparently asking for a Florist.

01:04:52.671 --> 01:04:57.713
<font color="#ffff00">Tensions between the United Kingdom and the
United States of America have never been higher.</font>

01:04:57.838 --> 01:05:02.838
<font color="#ffff00">The Ecuadoran Embassy has offered SuperBob political asylum.
-  Stay in your homes, try to hide.</font>

01:05:02.963 --> 01:05:08.296
<font color="#ffff00">Whatever he has planned, it could
spell disaster for us all.</font>

01:05:10.088 --> 01:05:14.088
<font color="#ffff00">Doris. We're meant to be together.</font>

01:05:15.796 --> 01:05:19.421
<font color="#ffff00">I don't even feel like I have to say it,
 because I feel like you probably know.</font>

01:05:19.546 --> 01:05:22.630
<font color="#ffff00">'Cause I know, and I think
I've probably always known.</font>

01:05:23.455 --> 01:05:26.513
<font color="#ffff00">The MOD is assuring the public
that SuperBob is not dangerous.</font>

01:05:26.638 --> 01:05:31.005
<font color="#ffff00">The British government asking the public to remain calm.
- Military helicopters are at high alert, ready to strike...</font>

01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:34.963
<font color="#ffff00">Peckham High Street, where
he allegedly bought a Wham Bar.</font>

01:05:35.088 --> 01:05:39.255
<font color="#ffff00">I do, I do love your face. I said it
before and it sounded like a joke,</font>

01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:43.255
<font color="#ffff00">But I mean it. I like your face,
I like what it does.</font>

01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:47.713
<font color="#ffff00">I like what it has to say, and you know,
I like everything with the face,</font>

01:05:48.005 --> 01:05:51.130
<font color="#ffff00">I wouldn't want a face in a jar,
just looking at me...</font>

01:05:51.713 --> 01:05:54.588
<font color="#ffff00">A huge number of witnesses report
seeing SuperBob landing in Peckham</font>

01:05:54.713 --> 01:05:58.005
<font color="#ffff00">Police are heading towards the Peckham area.
- someone claims he was eating a Wham Bar.</font>

01:05:58.130 --> 01:06:01.505
<font color="#ffff00">The international man hunt is zeroing in
on Peckham. - South London.</font>

01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:05.505
<font color="#ffff00">The Prime Minister has asked for SuperBob
to surrender himself immediately.</font>

01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:09.130
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, don't say any of that.
No not. Don't open your mouth,</font>

01:06:09.255 --> 01:06:15.130
<font color="#ffff00">Just... just walk in, and...
... try and kiss her.</font>

01:06:17.963 --> 01:06:21.838
<font color="#ffff00">The MOD has described it
as a diplomatic nightmare.</font>

01:06:21.963 --> 01:06:27.046
<font color="#ffff00">Authorities say that if Kenner can not
be stopped, he can at least be contained.</font>

01:06:27.171 --> 01:06:32.588
<font color="#ffff00">Doris! - You came to see me again! - What? No,
I haven't come to see you, Mum. - Charming.</font>

01:06:32.713 --> 01:06:36.380
<font color="#ffff00">What are you doing here, Bob? Where's June?
- Why are you asking me about June? I'm here to see you.</font>

01:06:36.505 --> 01:06:39.963
<font color="#ffff00">You came to see me.
- I haven't come to see you, Mum. I already saw you today!</font>

01:06:40.088 --> 01:06:44.213
<font color="#ffff00">A short while ago security cameras caught SuperBob
arriving outside of his Mother's care home.</font>

01:06:44.338 --> 01:06:46.430
<font color="#ffff00">The authorities have been mobilized.</font>

01:06:46.555 --> 01:06:50.096
<font color="#ffff00">I went all the way to Colombia, then I went to the airport,
there were no flights to Colombia tonight.</font>

01:06:50.221 --> 01:06:54.963
<font color="#ffff00">I know. - I know you know, that's why you're here!
- A large crowd has gathered outside the care home...</font>

01:06:55.088 --> 01:06:58.338
<font color="#ffff00">And it appears local residents are not
letting the authorities inside.</font>

01:06:58.463 --> 01:07:04.296
<font color="#ffff00">SuperBob has been very good to us, right? After all
he's done to us, he's a Peckham People. Peckham People!</font>

01:07:04.421 --> 01:07:07.546
<font color="#ffff00">A Gospel choir has formed a human
shield around the care home...</font>

01:07:07.671 --> 01:07:11.338
<font color="#ffff00">It's a stand-off. In Peckham.
-What is all this trouble?</font>

01:07:11.463 --> 01:07:13.755
<font color="#ffff00">This trouble? It's because of you.</font>

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:17.088
<font color="#ffff00">Don't bring me into your mess, Bob.
I am nothing to do with your mess.</font>

01:07:17.213 --> 01:07:19.755
<font color="#ffff00">If you think I'm responsible for any of this,</font>

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:25.046
<font color="#ffff00">then you are very disrespectful of me, of my culture...
-Doris, please! Shut up for a minute!</font>

01:07:25.171 --> 01:07:31.255
<font color="#ffff00">... he's been hiding inside, I'm going to try to
get in there, see if I can have a chat or a word with him.</font>

01:07:32.088 --> 01:07:35.088
<font color="#ffff00">I've come here to be nice to you.</font>

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:38.046
<font color="#ffff00">I need to tell you something.</font>

01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:48.755
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, Bob. -You know Javier.</font>

01:07:49.338 --> 01:07:53.671
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. -Javier just...
- Good to see you again.</font>

01:07:53.796 --> 01:07:57.630
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, Javi. Do you work and night shift as well?</font>

01:07:58.338 --> 01:08:02.380
<font color="#ffff00">No, Bob. Maybe you will understand this.</font>

01:08:03.838 --> 01:08:07.380
<font color="#ffff00">I found out Doris was going to leave for Colombia</font>

01:08:07.505 --> 01:08:11.588
<font color="#ffff00">And I realized something I think I've always known.</font>

01:08:13.213 --> 01:08:15.796
<font color="#ffff00">We are meant to be together.</font>

01:08:16.296 --> 01:08:19.962
<font color="#ffff00">And I know it. Doris knows it.
All of Peckham knows it,</font>

01:08:20.087 --> 01:08:24.005
<font color="#ffff00">It's so blindingly obvious, it
was staring me in the face.</font>

01:08:24.296 --> 01:08:27.505
<font color="#ffff00">And I spent too long just doing what I was told,</font>

01:08:27.671 --> 01:08:33.212
<font color="#ffff00">Scared to say "No" to anything.
Scared to... stand up for myself.</font>

01:08:35.546 --> 01:08:40.505
<font color="#ffff00">And then I heard that she was leaving and I
thought now is the time for me to say "No".</font>

01:08:41.130 --> 01:08:45.337
<font color="#ffff00">No, Doris. I do not want you to leave.</font>

01:08:47.462 --> 01:08:50.921
<font color="#ffff00">I want you here.
With me.</font>

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:56.837
<font color="#ffff00">Do you understand this, Bob?
- Yeah, I have some idea, yeah.</font>

01:08:57.546 --> 01:09:01.962
<font color="#ffff00">After all, I love your face.
-oh, fuck off.</font>

01:09:03.671 --> 01:09:06.796
<font color="#ffff00">Is Bob inside?
-Yes, he is inside. -Okay, what's he doing in there?</font>

01:09:06.921 --> 01:09:09.837
<font color="#ffff00">None of your business, it's something important.</font>

01:09:10.796 --> 01:09:15.212
<font color="#ffff00">That's great news, congratulations.
- Thank you, Bob.</font>

01:09:19.296 --> 01:09:24.921
<font color="#ffff00">Well I don't know why I'm hanging around here, he
loves your face. This is stupid, I should go. -Bob.</font>

01:09:25.046 --> 01:09:29.546
<font color="#ffff00">What? - What did you want to say to me?</font>

01:09:36.505 --> 01:09:41.212
<font color="#ffff00">I just wanted to say goodbye.
- Goodbye, Bob.</font>

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:49.046
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you. For everything.</font>

01:09:50.587 --> 01:09:52.688
<font color="#ffff00">Goodbye. -Goodbye.</font>

01:10:24.463 --> 01:10:28.421
<font color="#ffff00">Okay.
...Okay.</font>

01:10:32.963 --> 01:10:35.063
<font color="#ffff00">Okay.</font>

01:10:36.963 --> 01:10:39.713
<font color="#ffff00">I think that's enough goodbye.</font>

01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:50.213
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, good to catch up, Bob. Take care.</font>

01:10:51.005 --> 01:10:54.546
<font color="#ffff00">What did you want to say to me?
-I think you should go.</font>

01:10:54.671 --> 01:10:57.088
<font color="#ffff00">What?
- To Colombia, I think you should go.</font>

01:10:57.213 --> 01:11:00.213
<font color="#ffff00">You see, this is why I love you. Doris
I would never want you to leave.</font>

01:11:00.338 --> 01:11:04.546
<font color="#ffff00">For the kids. You were supposed to be working
with children, you have a gift for it.</font>

01:11:04.671 --> 01:11:08.421
<font color="#ffff00">How do you know that, you have never seen me with a
child? - You looked after me for three years.</font>

01:11:08.546 --> 01:11:11.005
<font color="#ffff00">You want me to go? -Yeah.</font>

01:11:11.755 --> 01:11:17.171
<font color="#ffff00">But... I could come with you.
- How?</font>

01:11:17.421 --> 01:11:20.455
<font color="#ffff00">I can fly faster than a speeding bullet,
I can work from anywhere.</font>

01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:24.338
<font color="#ffff00">You know what, I could come with you,
 I have family there. That's easier, Doris.</font>

01:11:24.463 --> 01:11:28.130
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe he's right. You should help the kids.
- He makes a good point.</font>

01:11:28.255 --> 01:11:31.463
<font color="#ffff00">We can get a house.
I could work from there. -True.</font>

01:11:31.588 --> 01:11:35.171
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, but the visa application...
Oh, it's very impractical.</font>

01:11:35.296 --> 01:11:39.930
<font color="#ffff00">I am resident, Doris, so...
much easier. - We should go.</font>

01:11:40.055 --> 01:11:43.713
<font color="#ffff00">The MOD will not like it.
-Oh, fuck the MOD. - Language!</font>

01:11:43.838 --> 01:11:47.838
<font color="#ffff00">You would do that for me? -Take my hand.
- Mmm, not flying. -We'll walk.</font>

01:11:47.963 --> 01:11:52.630
<font color="#ffff00">I'm very strong. - I'm fuckin' invulnerable.
- But you see Doris,  I am vulnerable.</font>

01:11:52.755 --> 01:11:56.130
<font color="#ffff00">I can fly. -I have a nice car.
-I hate flying. -She hates the flying.</font>

01:11:56.255 --> 01:11:59.921
<font color="#ffff00">I'm gonna kill you, mate.
.. Let's go.</font>

01:12:01.296 --> 01:12:05.130
<font color="#ffff00">Ah, my bag. -Ai, cabrone!
- I'm so sorry, Javier, I've been crushing hands all day.</font>

01:12:05.255 --> 01:12:07.588
<font color="#ffff00">That is really unlike me, that was out of order.
You seem like a nice man. - Goodbye, Mrs. Kenner.</font>

01:12:07.713 --> 01:12:12.421
<font color="#ffff00">I wish you all the best, we are gonna go.
-Good. -I love you, Mum. -I love you too.</font>

01:12:12.546 --> 01:12:17.296
<font color="#ffff00">Bye, Ted. - And you know what would make me happy, don't you?
-What's that, Mum? -Grandchildren!</font>

01:12:17.421 --> 01:12:21.504
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, God. The one thing I don't
need in bed is more pressure.</font>

01:12:23.838 --> 01:12:26.046
<font color="#ffff00">Is the Jamaican girl still here?</font>

01:12:30.130 --> 01:12:36.671
<font color="#ffff00">A whistleblower within the MOD has stated that no one
in the department has any idea what SuperBob will do next.</font>

01:12:40.130 --> 01:12:42.255
<font color="#ffff00">The MOD strenuously denying this allegation,</font>

01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:48.380
<font color="#ffff00">They insist that there is no reason to panic but,
for the time being, he remains unaccounted for.</font>

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:59.796
<font color="#ffff00">Why is Bob hiding? - He's not hiding.
He's doing something important that does not concern you.</font>

01:12:59.921 --> 01:13:03.463
<font color="#ffff00">The world waits to see what will
happen when SuperBob emerges.</font>

01:13:03.588 --> 01:13:09.463
<font color="#ffff00">All of you, all of you just take liberties,
and you come in here to exploit SuperBob.</font>

01:13:11.130 --> 01:13:16.463
<font color="#ffff00">The people of Peckham they are blocking all
the doors to the care home here, as you can see,</font>

01:13:16.588 --> 01:13:20.380
<font color="#ffff00">and failing to allow any of the authorities inside.</font>

01:13:38.671 --> 01:13:41.171
<font color="#ffff00">Okay. So.</font>

01:13:44.838 --> 01:13:48.213
<font color="#ffff00">What are you doing? Jesus Christ,
that is very dangerous!</font>

01:13:48.588 --> 01:13:51.630
<font color="#ffff00">I'm really sorry.
- I'm invincible, what do you think you're doing?</font>

01:13:51.755 --> 01:13:54.046
<font color="#ffff00">That is really dangerous. There are children about!</font>

01:13:54.171 --> 01:13:57.046
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry everyone. Really sorry.
I've thrown the whole mood down.</font>

01:13:57.171 --> 01:14:00.838
<font color="#ffff00">Don't fire a gun... Why is all this?
It's a complete waste of money.</font>

01:14:01.796 --> 01:14:05.046
<font color="#ffff00">This is ruined. I sleep in this!</font>

01:14:05.213 --> 01:14:07.313
<font color="#ffff00">You all look very foolish.</font>

01:14:07.671 --> 01:14:11.171
<font color="#ffff00">There's something very important
I have to say, if you don't mind.</font>

01:14:13.088 --> 01:14:17.713
<font color="#ffff00">I am resigning from the MOD.
I am going freelance.</font>

01:14:18.046 --> 01:14:20.755
<font color="#ffff00">I am no longer the property of Britain.</font>

01:14:21.421 --> 01:14:25.505
<font color="#ffff00">And there's gonna be no more forms.
No more fucking forms.</font>

01:14:25.671 --> 01:14:29.171
<font color="#ffff00">There, I said it. I don't like forms, all right?
There's going to be none of them. What?</font>

01:14:29.296 --> 01:14:33.713
<font color="#ffff00">Self-assessment forms. -What's it?
-You go freelance you have to use self-assessment forms.</font>

01:14:33.838 --> 01:14:37.946
<font color="#ffff00">Are you serious? Right. There's going to be one form.
There's going to be one form, but that doesn't matter.</font>

01:14:38.071 --> 01:14:40.088
<font color="#ffff00">You don't need to worry about it. That's not really
the point. The point is, look...</font>

01:14:40.213 --> 01:14:46.046
<font color="#ffff00">If any of you are in trouble, and you need help,
contact me and I will help you.</font>

01:14:46.171 --> 01:14:49.880
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know how you contact me,
we used to have a system when I was with the MOD,</font>

01:14:50.005 --> 01:14:55.172
<font color="#ffff00">Now we don't have, so... maybe we have a thing that
flashes, like a red and, uh...</font>

01:14:56.130 --> 01:15:01.296
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, fuck it! 07700900249.
That's my number. All right?</font>

01:15:01.796 --> 01:15:08.005
<font color="#ffff00">You can call me, and I will help you. But don't abuse the -
it's already ringing.</font>

01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:12.005
<font color="#ffff00">Okay. I will not deliver pizzas,
I'm saying that on live TV.</font>

01:15:12.130 --> 01:15:15.088
<font color="#ffff00">That is off the table.
I would like some time off.</font>

01:15:20.755 --> 01:15:23.213
<font color="#ffff00">Someone very special in my life.</font>

01:15:24.838 --> 01:15:27.671
<font color="#ffff00">I would like to try and make her happy.</font>

01:15:30.046 --> 01:15:35.880
<font color="#ffff00">If any of you are in trouble
and need you need help, you call me.</font>

01:15:37.213 --> 01:15:39.313
<font color="#ffff00">And I will save you.</font>

01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:44.796
<font color="#ffff00">I am not a civil servant.
I'm SuperBob.</font>

01:15:49.963 --> 01:15:52.063
<font color="#ffff00">Doris...</font>

01:15:54.005 --> 01:15:56.105
<font color="#ffff00">Let's go.</font>

01:15:57.671 --> 01:15:59.771
<font color="#ffff00">Bob...</font>

01:16:03.296 --> 01:16:05.396
<font color="#ffff00">Bye, Theresa.</font>

01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:44.655
<font color="#ffff00">Hey! -Hi.
-How are you guys?</font>

01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:46.796
<font color="#ffff00">Good, how are you? -Good.</font>

01:16:46.921 --> 01:16:51.588
<font color="#ffff00">Great. You look really good.
-So do you. Growing a beard. -Thank you.</font>

01:16:53.546 --> 01:16:58.671
<font color="#ffff00">So here we are. Are you happy?
-Am I happy?</font>

01:17:02.046 --> 01:17:06.629
<font color="#ffff00">We don't need words. We don't need
to see each other, to know.</font>

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:08.896
<font color="#ffff00">We... You know?</font>

01:17:09.021 --> 01:17:14.296
<font color="#ffff00">We built a home together.
We've got a home that we live in.</font>

01:17:15.838 --> 01:17:17.938
<font color="#ffff00">Am I happy?</font>

01:17:19.171 --> 01:17:24.671
<font color="#ffff00">I have been moved to Afghanistan.
A relief. Very happy about that.</font>

01:17:26.088 --> 01:17:30.505
<font color="#ffff00">You've no idea what my life was
like before, a constant firefight.</font>

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.588
<font color="#ffff00">Afghanistan, this is easy.</font>

01:17:34.963 --> 01:17:36.963
<font color="#ffff00">This is a joy.</font>

01:17:37.088 --> 01:17:41.755
<font color="#ffff00">This is a delight. They'll be fine.</font>

01:17:49.255 --> 01:17:54.088
<font color="#ffff00">She's a nightmare. She literally never
shuts up, she doesn't stop talking.</font>

01:17:54.255 --> 01:17:59.463
<font color="#ffff00">You have to send help, I can't take it anymore.
- What did you say? -Nothing.</font>

01:18:00.713 --> 01:18:03.463
<font color="#ffff00">I will see these films, you know?
 -Yeah.</font>

01:18:04.171 --> 01:18:09.421
<font color="#ffff00">So why did you say something?
-'Cause I'm an idiot? -'Cause you are an idiot. -Okay.</font>

01:18:09.546 --> 01:18:11.646
<font color="#ffff00">Come here.</font>

01:18:17.213 --> 01:18:20.255
<font color="#ffff00">Hello? Okay, where are you?</font>

01:18:20.921 --> 01:18:23.021
<font color="#ffff00">Hasta luego.</font>

01:18:27.796 --> 01:18:31.963
<font color="#ffff00">Hi.
-Go. Save the world.</font>

01:18:36.296 --> 01:18:38.396
<font color="#ffff00">Hi Barry.</font>

01:19:14.796 --> 01:19:20.213
<font color="#ffff00">We're looking at the rock, the meteor if you like,
that struck Bob from Peckham Rye Park.</font>

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:23.630
<font color="#ffff00">It could hold the
key to his powers.</font>

01:19:23.755 --> 01:19:28.046
<font color="#ffff00">If we find the answer to that,
there's no telling what we could do.</font>

01:19:28.171 --> 01:19:32.504
<font color="#ffff00">Have you found anything?
-No. Six years, absolutely fuck-all.</font>

01:19:32.755 --> 01:19:35.380
<font color="#ffff00">It might as well be a purple turd.</font>

01:19:35.505 --> 01:19:41.796
<font color="#ffff00">So I had another accident at work, and
Bob turned up, and it was just a superb experience.</font>

01:19:43.713 --> 01:19:47.546
<font color="#ffff00">Got me out safely, lovely small talk,
made sure I was okay,</font>

01:19:47.671 --> 01:19:53.588
<font color="#ffff00">Didn't have to fill in any forms, and
didn't stink of onions. So, thank you, Bob.</font>

01:19:54.130 --> 01:19:58.255
<font color="#ffff00">Is he in there now? -No, he's not in there now.
-Sorry.</font>

01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:02.088
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, it's a proverbial home. -I see.</font>

01:20:02.338 --> 01:20:07.255
<font color="#ffff00">You know? I mean, who writes
your questions, man? -Sorry.</font>

01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:11.630
<font color="#ffff00">So you got saved by Bob again, what was that like?
- Yeah, I fell down a pothole.</font>

01:20:11.755 --> 01:20:15.880
<font color="#ffff00">I got my leg trapped.
He came, was very swift.</font>

01:20:16.005 --> 01:20:21.213
<font color="#ffff00">Utterly charming, affable,
looks great, and was just lovely.</font>

01:20:21.713 --> 01:20:24.796
<font color="#ffff00">Just a really lovely experience. I'm really happy.</font>

01:20:25.963 --> 01:20:28.421
<font color="#ffff00">So got a little thing for him, have you?</font>

01:20:28.546 --> 01:20:33.046
<font color="#ffff00">I'm married.
- It's impressive you know SuperBob.</font>

01:20:33.171 --> 01:20:38.754
<font color="#ffff00">Saw the bloke from "Birds of a Feather" about three
weeks ago just down Stevenage Road.</font>

01:20:39.546 --> 01:20:42.213
<font color="#ffff00">You know... just, whatever.</font>

01:22:14.963 --> 01:22:19.546
<font color="#ffff00">Doesn't it fly by? Doesn't it?
Doesn't it though, like... whoosh.</font>

01:22:22.546 --> 01:22:26.546
<font color="#ffff00">...</font>

01:22:27.305 --> 01:22:33.310
