IS THAT THE VICTIM HAD SEX

WITH SOMEONE WHO USED
A SPERMICIDAL CONDOM.

06:52.542 --> 06:54.125

06:55.542 --> 06:58.667
- OR MAYBE SHE MET GELLAR,
HAD SEX WITH HIM,

06:58.667 --> 07:01.041

07:01.041 --> 07:02.709
- OR MAYBE
IT WAS GELLAR'S ACCOMPLICE.

- CAN'T SAY FOR SURE
EITHER WAY.

AS FAR AS WE KNOW,
SHE DIDN'T KNOW GELLAR.

- WHAT DID WE GET
ON GELLAR'S LAST GIG?

- WELL, LET'S GO UP THERE
AND MAKE IT CLEAR TO THEM

07:22.750 --> 07:23.834

WHETHER THEY'RE THRILLED OR NOT.

07:23.834 --> 07:24.875

07:28.000 --> 07:30.083

BUT THE NECROPSY ON THEM
TURNED UP JACK AND SHIT.

07:32.875 --> 07:34.583

WAS LOCAL GREENERY.

07:34.583 --> 07:36.750

08:27.500 --> 08:29.500

25:00.917 --> 25:03.458
IF I FIND TRAVIS MARSHALL
TO BE GUILTY...

25:07.291 --> 25:10.166
THEN I WILL SNUFF OUT HIS LIGHT.

25:28.542 --> 25:30.333
HE'S NEAT.

25:30.333 --> 25:32.625
EVERYTHING IN ITS RIGHT PLACE.

25:40.333 --> 25:41.792
MASTERS DEGREE IN ART HISTORY

25:41.792 --> 25:43.667
FROM THE UNIVERSITY
OF TALLAHASSEE,

25:43.667 --> 25:47.333
THE SAME PLACE GELLAR TAUGHT AT
BEFORE HE DISAPPEARED.

26:05.333 --> 26:09.125
I UNDERSTAND THE URGE
TO END SOMEONE'S LIFE,

26:09.125 --> 26:12.875
BUT WHAT IS THIS FASCINATION
WITH ENDING THE WORLD?

26:34.375 --> 26:36.500
LOOKS LIKE THE SAME NUMBERS

26:36.500 --> 26:38.875
WE FOUND
IN THE DOOMSDAY VICTIMS.

27:03.083 --> 27:04.959
DEFACING THE BIBLE.

27:04.959 --> 27:06.875
I'M PROBABLY BREAKING A RULE.

27:57.875 --> 28:00.166
HELLO, DOOMSDAY KILLER.

28:00.166 --> 28:02.125
- I SWEAR TO GOD,
YOU'RE THE ONLY COP I KNOW

28:02.125 --> 28:03.333
THAT DRIVES THE SPEED LIMIT.

28:03.333 --> 28:04.500
- THAT CAR'S NOT A TOY.

28:04.500 --> 28:06.250
IN THE RIGHT CONDITIONS,
IT'LL TOP 110 EASY.

28:06.250 --> 28:07.500
- AND THESE WEREN'T
THE RIGHT CONDITIONS?

28:07.500 --> 28:12.208
- NO.

28:12.208 --> 28:13.333
IS THAT OUR PROFESSOR?

28:13.333 --> 28:15.792
- PROFESSOR PORTER?

28:15.792 --> 28:18.542
- YES.
- HI, I'M DETECTIVE QUINN.

28:18.542 --> 28:21.166
THIS IS SERGEANT BATISTA.
MIAMI METRO HOMICIDE.

28:21.166 --> 28:23.166
DR. KNUDSON, THE DEPARTMENT
HEAD, SAID WE'D FIND YOU HERE.

28:23.166 --> 28:25.250
- RIGHT.

28:25.250 --> 28:26.542
HE TOLD ME
YOU WERE COMING.

28:26.542 --> 28:29.500
- SO YOU KNEW PROFESSOR GELLAR?

28:29.500 --> 28:31.917
- I DID,
BUT I WANT TO STATE UPFRONT

28:31.917 --> 28:33.875
THAT PROFESSOR GELLAR
DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

28:33.875 --> 28:36.458
WITH THOSE CRAZY REVELATION
KILLINGS.

28:36.458 --> 28:37.875
- AND YOU KNOW THIS HOW?

28:37.875 --> 28:40.166
- I WAS HIS TEACHER'S ASSISTANT
FOR A YEAR.

28:40.166 --> 28:42.041
HE EVEN HELPED ME
GET MY JOB.

28:42.041 --> 28:43.291
- HAVE YOU SEEN HIM RECENTLY?

28:43.291 --> 28:44.917
- NO, NOT SINCE HE LEFT.

28:44.917 --> 28:46.083
- WHEN WAS THAT?

28:46.083 --> 28:47.917
- THREE YEARS AGO ABOUT.

28:47.917 --> 28:50.041
- WHAT ABOUT HIS BLOG,
"THE BEGINNING OF THE END"?

28:50.041 --> 28:52.458
I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,
THERE'S SOME PRETTY CRAZY STUFF

28:52.458 --> 28:54.208
ON THERE, AND A LOT OF IT
IS IN LINE WITH THE KILLINGS.

28:54.208 --> 28:58.125
- HE LIKES TO STIR UP TROUBLE,

28:58.125 --> 28:59.709
MAKE PEOPLE THINK.

28:59.709 --> 29:02.709
THAT'S WHAT MADE
EVERYONE LOVE HIM.

29:02.709 --> 29:05.208
- OH, SO YOU LOVED HIM?

29:05.208 --> 29:06.625
- WAS HE ECCENTRIC?

29:06.625 --> 29:08.333
YEAH.

29:08.333 --> 29:10.083
BUT HE WAS ALSO SMART,

29:10.083 --> 29:11.458
CHARISMATIC,

29:11.458 --> 29:13.166
BRILLIANT EVEN.

29:13.166 --> 29:14.917
HE SAW THINGS
BETWEEN LINES OF TEXT

29:14.917 --> 29:16.917
THAT NOBODY ELSE COULD.

29:16.917 --> 29:19.250
BEING WITH HIM
WAS AN INCREDIBLE ADVENTURE.

29:19.250 --> 29:23.041
- SO YOU DID LOVE HIM?

29:23.041 --> 29:24.208
- WE WERE CLOSE.

29:24.208 --> 29:25.417
- CLOSE, HUH?

29:25.417 --> 29:27.125
SMART WOMAN LIKE YOU
WITH YOUR LOOKS,

29:27.125 --> 29:28.375
I BET HE WAS HITTING
ON YOU ALL THE TIME.

29:28.375 --> 29:29.709
I MEAN, FUCK,
IF WE WORKED TOGETHER,

29:29.709 --> 29:32.917
I'D HAVE A HARD TIME NOT WANTING
TO GET CLOSE TO YOU.

29:32.917 --> 29:35.917
- IT WAS MORE
THAN JUST A FLIRTATION.

29:35.917 --> 29:38.333
WE LIVED TOGETHER.

29:38.333 --> 29:39.583
FOR A WHILE.

29:39.583 --> 29:40.750
- YOU'RE NOT TOGETHER ANYMORE.

29:40.750 --> 29:43.000
- MY YEAR AS HIS T.A. ENDED,

29:43.000 --> 29:45.083
HE FOUND
ANOTHER CUTE BRUNETTE,

29:45.083 --> 29:46.208
DID THE SAME THING WITH HER.

29:46.208 --> 29:48.959
- GELLAR HAD A THING
FOR BRUNETTE STUDENTS?

29:48.959 --> 29:53.083
- I FOUND OUT I WAS ONE
IN A LONG LINE OF GIRLS,

29:53.083 --> 29:56.250
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT WAS NO BIG DEAL.

29:56.250 --> 29:57.625
I'M GLAD I GOT THE CHANCE
TO KNOW HIM.

29:57.625 --> 29:58.792
HE WAS GOOD TO ME.

29:58.792 --> 30:01.959
- ERIN, OUR ANGEL,
WAS A BRUNETTE.

30:01.959 --> 30:05.875
- WELL, IF BY SOME MIRACLE,

30:05.875 --> 30:07.375
HE CONTACTS YOU--

30:07.375 --> 30:08.834
- YOU'LL BE THE FIRST ONE
I CALL,

30:08.834 --> 30:13.417
IF ONLY TO PROVE
YOU HAVE THE WRONG GUY.

30:13.417 --> 30:15.375
- HEY, PROFESSOR PORTER,

30:15.375 --> 30:17.792
WE'RE GONNA BE STUCK HERE
FOR THE NIGHT.

30:17.792 --> 30:19.750
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO KNOW

30:19.750 --> 30:21.166
OF ANY GOOD SPOTS
WHERE WE COULD GET A DRINK

30:21.166 --> 30:22.542
THIS EVENING,
WOULD YOU?

30:22.542 --> 30:23.667
LIKE SOME PLACE KIND OF QUIET?

30:23.667 --> 30:25.834
- MAYBE I DO.

30:29.959 --> 30:31.625
- JESUS CHRIST.

30:42.291 --> 30:43.834
- DO YOU ALWAYS BRING YOUR WORK
HOME WITH YOU?

30:43.834 --> 30:46.542
- I CAN'T WORK FOR FUCK
IN MY NEW OFFICE.

30:46.542 --> 30:50.083
IT'S LIKE LAGUERTA'S PERFUME
SEEPED INTO THE WALLS.

30:50.083 --> 30:51.792
IF SHE EVER HAD A SOUL,
IT'S STILL IN THERE.

30:51.792 --> 30:54.542
LIFE WAS SO MUCH SIMPLER

30:54.542 --> 30:56.375
WHEN ALL I HAD TO DO
WAS SOLVE MURDERS.

30:56.375 --> 30:57.375
- RED TO BLACK.

30:57.375 --> 30:59.458
WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.
- WHO DID IT?

30:59.458 --> 31:03.125
- WIFE.
MURDER-SUICIDE.

31:03.125 --> 31:04.500
THAT BROTHER OF YOURS SOLVED IT

31:04.500 --> 31:06.458
LIKE HE WAS GETTING A MESSAGE
FROM THE DEAD.

31:06.458 --> 31:08.959
- YEAH,
HE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL.

31:08.959 --> 31:10.417
OOH, NICE PLACE.

31:10.417 --> 31:13.208
RIGHT BY THE BEACH TOO.

31:13.208 --> 31:16.417
NOTHING LIKE A MURDER-SUICIDE
TO FUCK UP A GREAT HOUSE.

31:16.417 --> 31:17.417
- I'VE SEEN WORSE.

31:17.417 --> 31:19.709
MALE, 70s,

31:19.709 --> 31:20.792
SELF-INFLICTED SHOTGUN

31:20.792 --> 31:22.041
IN THE BRAINPAN,

31:22.041 --> 31:24.166
WHICH IS BAD ENOUGH,

31:24.166 --> 31:25.542
BUT HE HAD CATS.

31:25.542 --> 31:27.083
AND THEY GOT HUNGRY.

31:27.083 --> 31:30.208
- ENOUGH SAID.
- AH, CHICAGO.

31:30.208 --> 31:32.500
- MISS IT?

31:32.500 --> 31:33.959
- MISS THE FOOD.

31:33.959 --> 31:36.333
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T GET
A DECENT HOT DOG ANYWHERE.

31:36.333 --> 31:39.959
BUT HOMICIDE IS HOMICIDE.

31:39.959 --> 31:43.709
- YEAH. I SEE THE WAY YOU LOOK
AT PEOPLE AROUND HERE.

31:43.709 --> 31:45.625
YOU GOT
THE WORLD'S YOUNGEST LT,

31:45.625 --> 31:47.500
BATISTA AND HIS HOT ROD,

31:47.500 --> 31:48.834
MASUKA WITH--

31:48.834 --> 31:51.125
- I MADE THE MISTAKE
OF GOING IN HIS LAB UNANNOUNCED.

31:51.125 --> 31:54.625
HE WAS--
- ENOUGH SAID.

31:54.625 --> 31:55.709
HE'S GOT SOME FUCKED-UP SHIT
GOING ON,

31:55.709 --> 31:56.959
BUT HE GETS IT DONE.

31:56.959 --> 32:00.583
- THE SAME COULD BE SAID
FOR YOU, HUH?

32:00.583 --> 32:04.458
- GOOD NIGHT, ANDERSON.

32:04.458 --> 32:06.750
[laughter]

32:06.750 --> 32:08.208
- I'M GRADING THIS PAPER,

32:08.208 --> 32:10.417
WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
I REALIZE

32:10.417 --> 32:12.375
I'VE READ THIS BEFORE.

32:12.375 --> 32:13.625
- NO WAY.

32:13.625 --> 32:14.959
- THIS DUMBASS STUDENT

32:14.959 --> 32:15.959
CHANGED SOME WORDS AROUND,

32:15.959 --> 32:20.125
BUT HE PLAGIARIZED
C.S. LEWIS.

32:20.125 --> 32:21.250
C.S. LEWIS.

32:21.250 --> 32:23.542
- I SHOULD ARREST THIS GUY
RIGHT NOW.

32:23.542 --> 32:24.667
I'VE GOT MY CUFFS ON ME.

32:24.667 --> 32:25.834
WE CAN GO.
I MEAN--

32:25.834 --> 32:27.500
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

32:27.500 --> 32:29.834
- YEAH?
YOU WANT ANOTHER ROUND?

32:29.834 --> 32:32.417
- YOU'RE NOT MARRIED,
ARE YOU?

32:32.417 --> 32:34.208
- DEFINITELY NOT.

32:34.208 --> 32:35.792
- THEN I WANT ANOTHER DRINK.

32:35.792 --> 32:37.792
- ANOTHER ROUND, PLEASE.

32:37.792 --> 32:39.917
THANK YOU.
OH, WHO LOOKS SHOWS UP

32:39.917 --> 32:41.250
WHEN I'M BUYING DRINKS,
HUH?

32:41.250 --> 32:43.625
- HEY, LISTEN,
WE GOT A LONG RIDE

32:43.625 --> 32:45.000
DOWN TO MIAMI TOMORROW.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.959
YOU WANT TO CALL IT?
- ONE SECOND.

32:53.500 --> 32:55.041
YOU CAN CALL IT
IF YOU WANT,

32:55.041 --> 32:57.500
BUT I'M ABOUT TO CROSS
A FUCKING COLLEGE PROFESSOR

32:57.500 --> 32:58.625
OFF MY BUCKET LIST.

32:58.625 --> 33:00.792
- OH, BE CAREFUL, PARTNER.

33:00.792 --> 33:02.375
SHE'S PART
OF OUR INVESTIGATION.

33:02.375 --> 33:04.083
- NO, SHE'S NOT.
SHE'S JUST LIKE A NICE PERSON

33:04.083 --> 33:07.041
WE TALKED TO,
YOU KNOW.

33:07.041 --> 33:09.458
- THERE'S LIKE 20 OTHER WOMEN
HERE YOU COULD FUCK.

33:09.458 --> 33:11.959
- I'VE ALREADY SPENT
LIKE 80 BUCKS ON HER, THOUGH,

33:11.959 --> 33:13.750
YOU KNOW, SO IT'S, LIKE,
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE

33:13.750 --> 33:16.125
TO START ALL OVER AGAIN.

33:16.125 --> 33:17.458
GET OUT OF HERE.
COME ON.

33:17.458 --> 33:19.959
WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER
IN THE MORNING, ALL RIGHT?

33:19.959 --> 33:22.291
- YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE.
- YEAH, GO ON, BABY.

33:22.291 --> 33:25.667
[laughs]

33:25.667 --> 33:29.333
AND THERE THEY ARE.

33:29.333 --> 33:30.625
- THANK YOU.

33:30.625 --> 33:35.500
- HERE'S TO YOU.

33:35.500 --> 33:38.291
- [laughs]

34:07.542 --> 34:09.041
- HI, BUDDY.

34:09.041 --> 34:11.750
ARE YOU GOING TO SLEEP?

34:11.750 --> 34:13.542
ARE YOU GOING TO BED?

34:13.542 --> 34:16.458
ARE YOU TIRED?

34:16.458 --> 34:18.166
- FOUND YOUR RING.

34:18.166 --> 34:19.750
- OH, JEEZ,
YOU'RE A LIFESAVER.

34:19.750 --> 34:22.250
- DEB, REALLY?

34:24.583 --> 34:27.250
- AH, SHIT.

34:29.625 --> 34:31.208
- HE CAME IN HERE
TO GIVE YOU A GOOD NIGHT KISS,

34:31.208 --> 34:32.959
NOT LOOK AT PICTURES
OF DEAD BODIES.

34:32.959 --> 34:35.250
- YEAH, WELL, MAYBE IF YOU
GAVE ME A LITTLE WARNING.

34:35.250 --> 34:36.917
- ISN'T THERE ANYWHERE ELSE
YOU CAN DO THIS, DEB?

34:36.917 --> 34:39.250
- RIGHT NOW?
NO. NOWHERE.

34:39.250 --> 34:41.208
- REALLY? THE LIEUTENANT
DOESN'T GET AN OFFICE?

34:41.208 --> 34:43.291
- I DON'T LIKE MY OFFICE.

34:43.291 --> 34:45.208
I LIKE TO WORK HERE.
- OH.

34:45.208 --> 34:47.625
- HARRISON'S GOT AN ENTIRE
GODDAMN APARTMENT OVER THERE.

34:47.625 --> 34:48.583
I'VE GOT JACK SHIT.

34:48.583 --> 34:50.250
- HE JUST WANTED
TO SAY GOOD NIGHT.

34:50.250 --> 34:51.417
- I KNOW THAT.

34:51.417 --> 34:53.583
NEXT TIME, WHY DON'T YOU
CALL ME OVER THERE?

34:53.583 --> 34:55.291
- I WILL.
FROM NOW ON.

34:55.291 --> 34:58.083
AND MAYBE YOU COULD KEEP

34:58.083 --> 34:59.917
THE PHOTOS ON DEXTER'S DESK,

34:59.917 --> 35:01.166
SO HARRISON WON'T SEE THEM.

35:01.166 --> 35:03.041
- AGAIN,
IF YOU WERE DOING YOUR JOB,

35:03.041 --> 35:04.542
THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

35:04.542 --> 35:06.291
- MY JOB?

35:06.291 --> 35:07.583
- YES.
- REALLY?

35:07.583 --> 35:10.792
YOU MEAN MY JOB ISN'T TO BE
YOUR FUCKING MAID?

35:10.792 --> 35:11.959
- OH.
- UH-OH.

35:11.959 --> 35:13.125
- I FOUND IT.
- THANK YOU.

35:13.125 --> 35:14.667
- IN HARRISON'S TOY BOX.
- THANKS.

35:14.667 --> 35:15.709
- YOU'RE REALLY LUCKY
HE DIDN'T EAT IT.

35:15.709 --> 35:16.875
- OH, PLEASE.

35:16.875 --> 35:18.417
- THANK GOD YOU'RE HOME.
- HELLO.

35:18.417 --> 35:20.208
- SHE NEEDS TO DO A BETTER JOB
OF WATCHING HARRISON.

35:20.208 --> 35:21.625
- SHE IS BRINGING HOME
ALL OF THESE HORRIBLE PICTURES.

35:21.625 --> 35:23.458
- WOULD IT BE WEIRD
IF I JUST LEFT?

35:23.458 --> 35:25.166
[overlapping statements]

35:25.166 --> 35:27.458
- HEY, JAMIE,

35:27.458 --> 35:29.041
IF HARRISON'S DOWN
FOR THE NIGHT,

35:29.041 --> 35:30.625
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
JUST GO ON HOME.

35:30.625 --> 35:32.500
- SEE YOU TOMORROW.

35:32.500 --> 35:34.834
- OKAY.

35:37.750 --> 35:39.041
- ARE YOU TAKING HER SIDE
ON THIS?

35:39.041 --> 35:42.208
- NO, I'LL TALK TO HER TOO
TOMORROW,

35:42.208 --> 35:44.500
BUT, DEB...

35:44.500 --> 35:47.834
YOU GOT TO ADMIT
THIS ISN'T GOOD FOR HARRISON.

35:47.834 --> 35:51.458
- YEAH.
I'M A MESS.

35:51.458 --> 35:53.458
MAYBE I DO NEED
TO GO TO THERAPY.

35:53.458 --> 35:55.667
- NO MORE THAN ME.

35:55.667 --> 35:58.333
- AM I THAT FUCKED UP?

36:08.125 --> 36:10.792
- BET YOU THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW
EACH OTHER'S NAMES.

36:10.792 --> 36:15.875
NO WONDER HE WANTS US
TO END IT ALL.

36:15.875 --> 36:18.542
[laughter]

36:18.542 --> 36:20.667
THESE TWO.

36:20.667 --> 36:22.166
FOLLOW THEM.

36:22.166 --> 36:25.125
- ARE YOU SURE?
HE LOOKS PRETTY BIG.

36:29.625 --> 36:32.583
- HE'S NOT AS BIG AS GOD.

36:32.583 --> 36:33.500
- [screams]

36:36.583 --> 36:38.125
- GO ON.

36:38.125 --> 36:40.500
GET THE GIRL
BEFORE SOMEBODY COMES.

36:40.500 --> 36:42.959
PUT HER IN THE TRUNK.

36:48.834 --> 36:51.125
- HELP ME.

36:51.125 --> 36:56.000
- I'M SORRY.

37:03.291 --> 37:06.000
- SEE HOW EASY IT IS?

37:10.250 --> 37:11.208
- COME ON.

37:16.041 --> 37:18.625
- HEY.

37:18.625 --> 37:20.542
COME ON IN.

37:20.542 --> 37:22.041
- WHERE'S QUINN?

37:22.041 --> 37:23.667
- BATHROOM.

37:23.667 --> 37:24.792
I'LL GET HIM.

37:24.792 --> 37:27.875
[water running]

37:33.041 --> 37:37.500
JOEY, YOUR FRIEND'S HERE.

37:37.500 --> 37:39.542
[water shuts off]

38:25.458 --> 38:29.917
- THE ALPHA AND OMEGA
OF THE ENESSERETTE.

38:58.333 --> 39:00.333
PROFESSOR PORTER,
COULD YOU COME OUT HERE?

39:03.875 --> 39:06.458
- UH, EXCUSE ME,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

39:06.458 --> 39:09.250
- THESE DRAWINGS,
THEY WERE GELLAR'S?

39:09.250 --> 39:10.667
- YOU CAN'T JUST START PICKING
THROUGH--

39:10.667 --> 39:12.000
- DID GELLAR DO THIS?

39:12.000 --> 39:14.333
- WHOA.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

39:14.333 --> 39:15.333
- OH, MY GOD.

39:15.333 --> 39:16.875
- DID HE?
- WELL, YEAH.

39:16.875 --> 39:20.208
LET ME SEE.

39:23.542 --> 39:25.375
- HOLY SHIT.

39:36.917 --> 39:39.208
- CAN I HELP YOU?

39:39.208 --> 39:41.375
- MICHELLE ROSS.

39:41.375 --> 39:42.959
THE THERAPIST
YOU'VE BEEN DODGING FOR WEEKS.

39:42.959 --> 39:44.083
- FUCK.

39:44.083 --> 39:45.291
I'M SORRY.

39:45.291 --> 39:47.333
- HAPPENS MORE THAN YOU THINK.

39:47.333 --> 39:49.500
I FIGURED SINCE YOU WEREN'T
COMING TO MY OFFICE--

39:49.500 --> 39:52.583
- THAT YOU WOULD COME TO MINE.

39:52.583 --> 39:54.375
- BELIEVE ME,
I UNDERSTAND.

39:57.125 --> 39:58.542
SO WE SHOULD PROBABLY GET DOWN
TO BUSINESS, RIGHT?

39:58.542 --> 40:00.917
- RIGHT HERE,
RIGHT NOW?

40:00.917 --> 40:02.917
- IS THAT OKAY?

40:02.917 --> 40:07.500
- LET'S DO THIS.

40:09.875 --> 40:12.417
- OKAY, JUST TO CLARIFY,

40:12.417 --> 40:13.875
THIS IS IN REFERENCE
TO THE SHOOTING

40:13.875 --> 40:16.375
AT DON ALDO'S?

40:16.375 --> 40:18.375
HAVE YOU BEEN EXPERIENCING
ANY LACK OF SLEEP

40:18.375 --> 40:19.458
FROM THE SHOOTING IN QUESTION?

40:19.458 --> 40:21.959
- FROM THE SHOOTING, NO.

40:21.959 --> 40:24.041
- HAVE YOU FOUND YOURSELF
DWELLING ON THAT DAY?

40:24.041 --> 40:27.750
- NO.
WHO HAS TIME?

40:27.750 --> 40:28.959
- HAVE YOU FOUND IT HARD
TO CONCENTRATE

40:28.959 --> 40:30.834
ON DAY-TO-DAY TASKS
BECAUSE OF THE INCIDENT?

40:30.834 --> 40:33.333
- NO.

40:33.333 --> 40:35.208
- FIND YOURSELF DRINKING MORE
THAN YOU DID

40:35.208 --> 40:36.250
BEFORE THE SHOOTING?

40:36.250 --> 40:41.291
- FUCK, I DON'T DRINK ENOUGH.

40:41.291 --> 40:42.792
THAT WAS A JOKE.

40:42.792 --> 40:44.750
- HM.

40:44.750 --> 40:47.000
HAVE YOU BEEN EXPERIENCING
ANY GUILT SINCE THE SHOOTING?

40:47.000 --> 40:48.625
- NO.

40:48.625 --> 40:51.458
IF HE WALKED THROUGH THAT DOOR,
I'D SHOOT HIM RIGHT NOW.

40:54.917 --> 40:57.083
- GREAT.

40:57.083 --> 40:59.000
SO IT SOUNDS
LIKE EVERYTHING'S FINE.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.208
- YEAH.

41:00.208 --> 41:01.542
EVERYTHING'S GREAT

41:01.542 --> 41:02.959
WITH THE SHOOTING.

41:02.959 --> 41:04.125
IT'S JUST EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED SINCE THEN

41:04.125 --> 41:07.834
THAT'S FUCKING ME UP.

41:07.834 --> 41:11.875
- LIKE WHAT?

41:11.875 --> 41:15.625
- LIKE BEING LIEUTENANT.

41:15.625 --> 41:18.625
AND ALL THE DAY-TO-DAY BULLSHIT
THAT COMES WITH IT.

41:18.625 --> 41:21.417
GOT THE DOOMSDAY KILLER
DOING HIS SHIT IN MY CITY,

41:21.417 --> 41:24.125
AND I TRY TO DO ANY WORK
IN HERE,

41:24.125 --> 41:26.417
AND I CAN'T,
AND--

41:26.417 --> 41:28.417
DID I MENTION I JUST BROKE UP
WITH MY BOYFRIEND

41:28.417 --> 41:29.792
AND I DON'T HAVE A PLACE
TO LIVE ANYMORE,

41:29.792 --> 41:31.500
SO, AT THE END OF THE DAY,
I CAN'T EVEN GO HOME?

41:31.500 --> 41:35.709
I'M LIVING WITH MY BROTHER
AND HIS SON, AND...

41:35.709 --> 41:37.041
DON'T GET ME WRONG,
I LOVE THEM,

41:37.041 --> 41:39.041
IT'S JUST...

41:39.041 --> 41:42.625
THERE'S A REASON I'M AN AUNT
AND NOT A PARENT AND...

41:45.333 --> 41:46.208
I JUST FEEL LIKE I DON'T
HAVE A SPACE

41:46.208 --> 41:49.667
TO CALL MY OWN RIGHT NOW.

41:52.792 --> 41:55.500
- SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD GET
SOME PLACE THAT'S YOUR OWN.

42:05.125 --> 42:08.041
- DETECTIVE ANDERSON

42:08.041 --> 42:08.959
AND GIRLFRIEND.

42:08.959 --> 42:10.959
- HER?
NO WAY.

42:10.959 --> 42:13.625
I'M MARRIED.
SHE'S MY BOSS.

42:13.625 --> 42:15.750
- LIEUTENANT DEBRA MORGAN,
MIAMI METRO HOMICIDE.

42:15.750 --> 42:17.458
- I'M SO SORRY.
I THOUGHT THAT YOU TWO--

42:17.458 --> 42:18.750
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
- MY BAD.

42:18.750 --> 42:20.709
- CAN WE GET
THIS CRIME SCENE TAPE DOWN?

42:20.709 --> 42:22.709
- WOW.
IT TAKES A LIEUTENANT

42:22.709 --> 42:24.375
TO TELL ME IT'S OKAY
TO RENT THIS PLACE, HUH?

42:24.375 --> 42:26.542
- CAN WE GO INSIDE?
- BY ALL MEANS.

42:31.375 --> 42:35.834
- THANK YOU.

42:35.834 --> 42:39.458
I WANTED TO COME BY AND SEE IF
I COULD POSSIBLY RENT THE PLACE.

42:39.458 --> 42:41.333
- OH?

42:41.333 --> 42:43.542
- THE FLOORS ARE A MESS.

42:43.542 --> 42:45.792
- YEAH, THEY ARE,
AREN'T THEY?

42:45.792 --> 42:48.166
- YES, THEY ARE.

42:48.166 --> 42:50.542
MIGHT HAVE TO REPLACE 'EM.

42:50.542 --> 42:52.875
I MEAN, THE TOXIC DAMAGE.

42:52.875 --> 42:54.375
- TOXIC?

42:54.375 --> 42:55.458
- BLOOD-BORNE ANTIGENS

42:55.458 --> 42:58.583
CAN LIVE FOR TWO WEEKS EASY.

43:00.875 --> 43:03.417
OF COURSE,
HEP C IS ALWAYS A RISK.

43:03.417 --> 43:05.542
- I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

43:05.542 --> 43:07.208
- OH, GOD,
JUST WHAT I NEEDED.

43:07.208 --> 43:10.959
- LOOK, IT'S NO SECRET

43:10.959 --> 43:14.041
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A HELL
OF A TIME RENTING THIS PLACE.

43:14.041 --> 43:17.291
LEGALLY, YOU'RE REQUIRED
TO DISCLOSE THE MURDER/SUICIDE.

43:17.291 --> 43:18.917
- BUT I ALREADY KNOW
ABOUT IT.

43:18.917 --> 43:20.375
- AND?

43:20.375 --> 43:24.083
- WHAT IF I WAS TO GIVE YOU

43:24.083 --> 43:29.625
2/3 OF THE CURRENT RENT
RIGHT NOW TODAY?

43:29.625 --> 43:34.250
- MAKE THAT 3/4, TWO-YEAR LEASE,
AND YOU CLEAN UP THE PLACE.

43:34.250 --> 43:36.291
- LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT YOURSELF
A NEW TENANT.

44:05.041 --> 44:08.583
- [sighs]

44:10.625 --> 44:14.917
AH, WHAT'S THE--
WHAT'S THE PROGRESS ON THE--

44:14.917 --> 44:17.500
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
I DID EVERYTHING

44:17.500 --> 44:18.959
I KNOW HOW,
BUT I WASN'T ABLE

44:18.959 --> 44:20.333
TO GET THE HAND BACK.

44:20.333 --> 44:22.250
THE BUYER BOUGHT IT USING
AN ESNIPER PROGRAM

44:22.250 --> 44:23.583
THAT FIREWALLS THE BUYER,

44:23.583 --> 44:25.458
SO WHOEVER'S GOT IT'S
GOT IT FOR GOOD.

44:25.458 --> 44:28.709
- OH, FUCK.
- HOWEVER...

44:28.709 --> 44:30.959
- I DO LIKE THE SOUND
OF YOUR HOWEVER.

44:30.959 --> 44:33.041
- I ERASED ANY TRACE
OF THE SALE FROM THE INTERNET.

44:33.041 --> 44:36.000
SO I'M SORRY,
THAT'S THE BEST I CAN DO.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.166
- SO IF ONE WERE
TO LOOK ONLINE--

44:39.166 --> 44:41.041
- IT'S LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED.

44:41.041 --> 44:43.166
- AND I NEVER CHECKED IT
OUT OF EVIDENCE.

44:43.166 --> 44:45.959
THERE'S NO TRAIL
COMING BACK TO HERE.

44:45.959 --> 44:50.166
AT THE WORST, THE EVIDENCE ROOM
FUCKED UP, NOT US.

44:50.166 --> 44:52.583
OUR DEPARTMENT'S SAFE.

44:52.583 --> 44:54.500
- AND WHILE I WAS
ON YOUR COMPUTER,

44:54.500 --> 44:56.875
I IMPROVED YOUR CREDIT RATING,
INSTALLED A MODDED-UP INTEL CHIP

44:56.875 --> 44:59.041
TO OVERCLOCK YOUR CPU,
AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY,

44:59.041 --> 45:02.208
I ADDED A PORN SCRUBBER
TO THAT THING.

45:02.208 --> 45:05.083
- [sighs]

45:05.083 --> 45:06.875
MY MAN.

45:06.875 --> 45:09.250
GIVE IT UP, LOU.

45:09.250 --> 45:10.458
[laughs]

45:10.458 --> 45:12.333
THANK YOU.

45:27.041 --> 45:28.333
[engine turns over]

45:31.625 --> 45:33.709
- DRIVE OUT
OF THE PARKING STRUCTURE,

45:33.709 --> 45:36.083
TURN RIGHT ON FLAGLER,
AND THEN DRIVE ON

45:36.083 --> 45:38.208
PAST THE MIAMI RIVER.

45:38.208 --> 45:41.333
NOD IF YOU UNDERSTAND.

45:43.083 --> 45:45.875
- [breathes heavily]

45:45.875 --> 45:47.917
YOU CAN TAKE THE CAR.

45:47.917 --> 45:50.583
IT'S YOURS, MY WALLET,
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

45:50.583 --> 45:53.583
- I WANT NONE OF THOSE THINGS,
TRAVIS.

45:56.458 --> 45:58.375
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

45:58.375 --> 46:00.542
- I WANT YOUR LIFE.

46:00.542 --> 46:03.333
JUST LIKE THE ONES YOU TOOK.

46:03.333 --> 46:05.250
DOOMSDAY KILLER.

46:05.250 --> 46:06.875
- GOD. GOD!

46:06.875 --> 46:08.083
- YEAH, LET'S START WITH HIM.

46:08.083 --> 46:09.333
I SUPPOSE IT WAS GOD

46:09.333 --> 46:12.041
WHO TOLD YOU TO KILL
ALL THOSE INNOCENT PEOPLE?

46:12.041 --> 46:14.000
- GOD DOESN'T TALK TO ME.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.625
- THEN HOW DO YOU KNOW?

46:17.625 --> 46:20.250
- HE TALKS
TO PROFESSOR GELLAR.

46:20.250 --> 46:21.625
- AND HOW DO YOU KNOW
HE TALKS TO GOD?

46:21.625 --> 46:23.417
- 'CAUSE I'VE SEEN IT.

46:23.417 --> 46:27.375
GOD SPEAKS TO THE PROFESSOR.

46:27.375 --> 46:31.834
HE SPEAKS
THROUGH THE PROFESSOR.

46:31.834 --> 46:33.792
- KEEP GOING.

46:33.792 --> 46:35.000
- BEFORE I MET HIM,

46:35.000 --> 46:36.333
I WAS LOST.

46:36.333 --> 46:38.542
BUT THEN THE PROFESSOR,

46:38.542 --> 46:40.125
HE SHOWED ME THE TRUTH.

46:40.125 --> 46:42.834
HE SHOWED ME THE WAY.

46:42.834 --> 46:45.500
HE'S A PROPHET
FILLED WITH TRUTH AND LIGHT.

46:45.500 --> 46:50.250
- BULLSHIT!

46:50.250 --> 46:53.291
YOU KILLED THOSE PEOPLE
BECAUSE YOU LIKE IT.

46:53.291 --> 46:55.834
ANSWER ME.

46:55.834 --> 46:59.959
- I COULDN'T DO IT.

46:59.959 --> 47:02.125
I'M A FAILURE.

47:02.125 --> 47:03.709
I'M FAILING GOD.

47:03.709 --> 47:06.750
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE?

47:06.750 --> 47:10.250
YES, YES, I WANTED
TO KILL THOSE PEOPLE,

47:10.250 --> 47:13.959
BUT I COULDN'T.

47:13.959 --> 47:17.792
- YOU'RE SAYING
GELLAR DOES THE KILLING.

47:17.792 --> 47:19.875
- HE'S SO MUCH STRONGER
THAN ME.

47:22.291 --> 47:24.667
THE THING IS, THERE'S NO FEAR.

47:24.667 --> 47:28.375
THERE'S NO REGRET.
BUT WITH ME IT'S--

47:28.375 --> 47:31.458
IT'S PATHETIC.

47:35.417 --> 47:38.542
- GELLAR IS PULLING YOU
TOWARD THE DARKNESS, TRAVIS,

47:38.542 --> 47:42.208
NOT THE LIGHT.

47:42.208 --> 47:44.000
- NO, YOU DON'T KNOW.

47:44.000 --> 47:47.834
- TRUST ME, I KNOW MORE
ABOUT DARKNESS THAN MOST,

47:47.834 --> 47:52.417
AND GELLAR IS PURE DARKNESS.

47:52.417 --> 47:54.625
YOU NEED TO FIND SOMEONE ELSE
TO FOLLOW.

47:54.625 --> 47:57.208
PULL OVER.

48:00.375 --> 48:03.333
GET OUT OF THE CAR.

48:03.333 --> 48:04.375
- WHAT?

48:04.375 --> 48:05.709
- GET OUT
AND START WALKING AWAY.

48:05.709 --> 48:08.667
YOU'LL FIND YOUR CAR
BACK AT THE MUSEUM.

48:22.166 --> 48:25.125
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,
TRAVIS WILL LEAD ME

48:25.125 --> 48:27.583
TO THE ONE WHO REALLY DESERVES
MY TABLE.

48:30.333 --> 48:32.083
[dialing]

48:32.083 --> 48:34.375
[cell phone ringing]

48:34.375 --> 48:36.542
- WHERE ARE YOU?

48:36.542 --> 48:41.083
- I'M ON MY WAY HOME.

48:41.083 --> 48:42.125
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

48:42.125 --> 48:45.834
- I DON'T FEEL GOOD.

48:45.834 --> 48:49.458
I'VE GOT--
I JUST FEEL SICK.

48:49.458 --> 48:50.917
I SHOULD GET SOME SLEEP.

48:50.917 --> 48:53.500
- TRAVIS, WHAT ARE YOU
NOT TELLING ME?

48:53.500 --> 48:54.750
- NOTHING.
NOTHING.

48:54.750 --> 48:56.875
I JUST--
I FEEL SICK.

48:56.875 --> 48:58.834
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW?

48:58.834 --> 49:03.125
- HEY, YOU REMEMBER THE STORY
ABOUT JONAH AND THE GREAT FISH?

49:05.083 --> 49:07.625
JONAH TRIED TO RUN
FROM GOD.

49:07.625 --> 49:10.625
HE DIDN'T GET TOO FAR.

49:10.625 --> 49:15.333
HOPE YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO RUN
FROM GOD TOO.

49:15.333 --> 49:17.208
THINK ABOUT IT.

49:27.709 --> 49:30.959
- I DON'T BELIEVE IN ANGELS,

49:30.959 --> 49:32.834
BUT I DO BELIEVE
THERE'S A CONSTANT STRUGGLE

49:32.834 --> 49:35.083
BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARK
IN THE WORLD.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.750
WHO KNOWS?
MAYBE BROTHER SAM IS RIGHT.

49:47.750 --> 49:50.458
MAYBE SOMETIMES
THE LIGHT CAN WIN OUT.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.291
- [whistles]

49:54.291 --> 49:57.917
[metal clanks]

50:00.875 --> 50:02.291
- BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE,

50:02.291 --> 50:05.166
DARKNESS USUALLY PREVAILS.

50:05.166 --> 50:06.500
[gunshots]
