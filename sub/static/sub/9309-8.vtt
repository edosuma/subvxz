A.K.A., Ten Mohs.

Maximum hardness on

- Rappers, athletes, young people

with a lot of money and no
understanding of understatement.

05:09.672 --> 05:12.523
According to his bodyguard,
Ten Mohs was having a great night.

05:12.525 --> 05:16.026
Top dog in the V.I.P. room,
buying champagne for his adoring public.

05:16.078 --> 05:20.414
Then he starts talking gibberish,
walks in here, and dies.

05:21.701 --> 05:24.868
- Stroke?
- Well, it's possible,

05:24.920 --> 05:27.087
but there's signs of acute cyanosis,

05:27.123 --> 05:30.541
which are not usually present
in stroke or cardiac arrest.

Let me guess. All the partygoers
ran out when he called 9-1-1?

- Like the wind.
- Kitchen staff?

05:36.682 --> 05:39.717
- What's faster than the wind?
- Kitchen staff with Visa problems?

- Sure.

05:58.654 --> 06:00.037
Wanna help me with this?

06:05.411 --> 06:06.960
Carrying a gun didn't get him killed,

06:06.996 --> 06:09.046
but maybe the reason he
was carrying a gun did.

06:13.135 --> 06:15.052
The safe hasn't been touched.

06:15.087 --> 06:18.088
There are thousands of
dollars worth of gems

06:18.090 --> 06:19.973

06:20.009 --> 06:22.593
If it wasn't about money,
why would anyone kill him?

06:22.595 --> 06:25.095
Well, we don't know that
he was murdered, Ms. Garret.

06:25.097 --> 06:27.481
He was young, healthy, didn't
do drugs, only drank a little.

06:27.516 --> 06:28.932
What else could've happened?

06:28.984 --> 06:30.601
That's what they're

06:30.653 --> 06:33.821
<i>No, they're here talking to me,

06:33.856 --> 06:36.824
And whoever killed him
is gonna come for me next.

06:36.859 --> 06:40.027
- Why would you be a target?
- Ten Mohs and I were partners.

06:40.079 --> 06:42.996
He found the gems.
I designed the jewelry.

06:43.032 --> 06:45.999
Made a great team. Revenues
were up 200% this year.

06:46.035 --> 06:49.002
So that means someone else
was down that equal amount.

06:49.038 --> 06:52.122
And Ten Mohs couldn't resist
rubbing their noses in it.

06:52.124 --> 06:55.008
Is that why he was carrying
an unlicensed handgun?

06:55.044 --> 06:58.512
Yeah, but... [sighs]
it's also part of the image.

06:59.965 --> 07:01.882
Could you give us the names
of these other jewelers?

07:01.934 --> 07:04.101

the Eightmans,

07:06.472 --> 07:08.194

Hugh and Todd,

07:08.195 --> 07:09.916

07:09.917 --> 07:12.025
Blingman out of business
two months ago.

07:12.061 --> 07:14.561
Could you give us their
real names, please?

07:17.867 --> 07:21.785
- I can make some calls.
- Thank you. That'd be very helpful.

07:21.821 --> 07:24.037
[horn honks in distance]

07:24.073 --> 07:26.156
Oh, I've been thinking
about your wardrobe,

07:26.158 --> 07:28.575
And I was wrong about
starting with ensembles.

07:28.627 --> 07:30.077
You're not an ensemble person.

07:30.129 --> 07:33.547
You just need a few high quality
pieces, and we'll build from there.

07:33.582 --> 07:35.048
I just need a new pair of pants ...

07:35.084 --> 07:36.834
is this why you brought me down here?

07:36.836 --> 07:40.530
No. Ten Mohs ingested an
S.T.X. neurotoxin that blocked

07:40.531 --> 07:44.224
the transmission of signals
between his body and brain,

07:44.260 --> 07:47.177
causing paralysis to
the voluntary muscles.

07:47.179 --> 07:48.846
So he couldn't breathe?

07:48.848 --> 07:51.181
Well, other things happened, too,
but that's why he died.

07:51.183 --> 07:56.687
Huh. And where does one
get this S.T.X. neurotoxin?

07:56.739 --> 07:59.523
Well, shellfish contaminated
with toxic algae blooms,

07:59.575 --> 08:02.192
- Puffer fish.
- Wait a minute. Isn't that that sushi

08:02.194 --> 08:05.863
- that you can't eat 'cause it'll kill ya?
- Yes, if it's not well prepared.

08:05.865 --> 08:08.198
As little as 25
milligrams could be fatal.

08:08.250 --> 08:11.084
Well, he could've had that voluntarily.

08:11.120 --> 08:14.705
Well, it wasn't on the club's menu.
But that's not a surprise.

08:14.707 --> 08:17.090
In Japan, chefs have to
be licensed to serve it.

08:17.126 --> 08:20.093
So a black market Puffer fish?

08:21.130 --> 08:25.015
So if he didn't eat it voluntarily,

08:25.050 --> 08:28.101
it would've been very easy
to hide in an oyster shooter,

08:28.137 --> 08:31.054
which was the only thing
he ate or drank last night.

08:31.056 --> 08:34.857
Diamonds... on his fingers
and in his stomach.

08:34.894 --> 08:36.777
Hmm.
A high refractive index of diamonds

08:36.812 --> 08:38.729
would explain the
shimmer on the fingers.

08:38.780 --> 08:40.731
I sent a tech over to the club.

08:40.783 --> 08:44.568
Apparently, our Mr. Ten Mohs
likes his drinks spiked

08:44.620 --> 08:47.037
with gypsum dust from the
gems he's cut for his clients.

08:47.072 --> 08:51.992
Uh, it's not Mr. Ten Mohs.
It's just "Ten Mohs."

08:53.295 --> 08:55.913
Oh. Right.
Like "Cher."

08:55.915 --> 09:00.634
No. Nothing like that.
Cher is amazing.

09:00.669 --> 09:02.741
Ten Mohs is just silly.

09:04.223 --> 09:07.674
So do the diamond flakes have
anything to do with why he's dead?

09:07.726 --> 09:12.012
No. Just a little factoid
plated for your edification.

09:12.064 --> 09:13.730

10:45.584 --> 10:48.635
- Ten Mohs specialty?
- Trashy bullshit specialty.

10:48.670 --> 10:51.171
The whole point of
a diamond is the sparkle.

10:51.173 --> 10:52.756
There's no sparkle there.

10:52.808 --> 10:55.175
It's black.
It don't know how to sparkle.

10:55.177 --> 10:56.843
Man, Marvin, you must've been something

10:56.895 --> 10:58.645
before Ten Mohs ran you out of business.

10:58.680 --> 11:01.515
People get tired of those things,
and Blingman will be ready.

11:01.567 --> 11:05.569
Blingman will be in jail.
Not a great retail environment.

11:05.604 --> 11:07.771
[scoffs]
I'm not going to jail.

11:10.776 --> 11:14.027
- You didn't do it.
- You said it.

11:14.079 --> 11:16.279
Okay, I want you to write
down how you killed Ten Mohs.

11:16.331 --> 11:17.864
And if you don't do it,

11:17.916 --> 11:19.533
I'm gonna go out on the
street and tell everybody

11:19.585 --> 11:21.535
how you cried like a
baby when you got in here.

11:21.587 --> 11:23.003
[rips paper]

11:23.038 --> 11:25.622
[slides paper and pen]

11:25.674 --> 11:27.841
Go ahead.
Just write down how you did it.

11:35.300 --> 11:40.754
"I, Blingman, killed
Ten Mohs, that punk."

11:43.725 --> 11:46.026
It lacks detail. Try again.

11:46.061 --> 11:49.062
You're just trying to
get some street cred.

11:49.464 --> 11:51.865
He made me look like a fool.

11:51.900 --> 11:53.733
<i>[Jane under breath] You are a fool.</i>

11:53.735 --> 11:56.152
At least I'm on the up-and-up.
That guy ... he was shady.

11:56.204 --> 11:59.823
- What kind of shady?
- You don't get diamonds at those prices

11:59.875 --> 12:03.159
unless you're helping people
move things that are hard to move.

12:03.211 --> 12:05.745
You're saying he was
working for the drug cartel?

12:07.049 --> 12:10.417
As I said, trashy bullshit.

12:12.254 --> 12:15.221
Too bad it isn't a crime to be stupid.

12:15.257 --> 12:17.924
The prisons would be full,
the streets would be empty.

12:17.926 --> 12:19.392
[laughs] Yeah.

12:19.428 --> 12:21.928
Ten Mohs was being sued
over a $200,000 black diamond

12:21.930 --> 12:24.931
that a tribe from the Amazon
rain forest says he stole.

12:24.933 --> 12:26.766
[cell phone rings]
Motive. I like it.

12:26.818 --> 12:29.903
[ring, beep]

12:29.938 --> 12:32.939
Hey, ma! What's up?
I'm working.

12:32.941 --> 12:34.274
The trial starts in three days,

12:34.326 --> 12:35.992
and we just found out
that the lead plaintiff,

12:36.028 --> 12:38.945
a tribal elder named Raya,
arrived in Boston yesterday.

12:39.297 --> 12:43.249
- Opportunity. Love it.
- We have an address on this guy?

12:43.285 --> 12:46.369
All right, all right, I'll be
down in the lobby in two minutes.

12:46.421 --> 12:48.922
[beep] Technically, talking
to your mother isn't working.

12:48.957 --> 12:50.123
She needs me.

12:54.880 --> 12:57.881
- You know, I don't have time for this.
- For what?

12:57.933 --> 12:59.182
We're having a meeting.

12:59.217 --> 13:01.635
About what?
I didn't prep for a meeting.

13:01.637 --> 13:03.186
No prep necessary.

13:03.221 --> 13:06.106
<i>[sighs]
Look, Jane's been through a lot.</i>

13:06.141 --> 13:09.225
She needs us to figure
out how we can help her.

13:09.277 --> 13:11.444
She told me all she needs is pants.

13:11.480 --> 13:14.314
- No, she needs to get out of that hotel.
- True.

13:14.366 --> 13:16.783
Otherwise, she's gonna
become stooped and grumpy.

13:16.818 --> 13:20.120
- True.
- Okay, so we're in agreement.

13:20.155 --> 13:23.873
I'll move in with Frankie, and
Jane will move into the guesthouse.

13:23.909 --> 13:26.376
W-What now?
I did not agree to that.

13:26.411 --> 13:27.911
I just agreed that

13:27.963 --> 13:29.462
I don't want Jane to end
up stooped and grumpy.

13:29.498 --> 13:32.716
Look, Frankie, it's the
only thing that makes sense.

13:32.751 --> 13:34.834
After what she's been through,

13:34.886 --> 13:39.422
<i>she needs privacy and space
to figure out what she's gonna do next,</i>

13:39.474 --> 13:43.009
and she needs the love and support
of her friends and family.

13:43.061 --> 13:44.978
Beautifully said, Angela.

13:45.013 --> 13:47.263
- [whispers] Thank you.
- Et tu, Maura?

13:49.151 --> 13:51.017
[kisses]

13:51.069 --> 13:53.570
You're a good boy.

13:56.825 --> 13:58.992
Great meeting.

14:03.415 --> 14:05.365
I'm gonna be sad if this guy admits it

14:05.417 --> 14:08.162
- and we don't have to work tonight.
- You need the overtime?

14:08.233 --> 14:10.837
No, I just... [sighs]
my hotel is uncomfortable.

14:10.872 --> 14:13.373
- And lonely.
- You can come stay with me.

14:13.425 --> 14:15.258
Oh, yeah.
Like I wanna listen to you

14:15.293 --> 14:17.293
talk goofy to Kiki
all night on the phone.

14:17.345 --> 14:19.228
No, thank you.

14:20.799 --> 14:22.015
[door creaks]

14:22.050 --> 14:24.243
- Can I help you?
- I'm Detective Korsak.

14:24.244 --> 14:26.578
Boston homicide.
This is Detective Rizzoli.

14:26.579 --> 14:30.056
- We're looking for Raya.
- Why?

14:30.058 --> 14:32.976
Well, I think that's between him and us.

14:33.028 --> 14:34.528
Well, I'm sorry.
He's not here.

14:34.529 --> 14:36.029
Perhaps you can come back later?

14:36.064 --> 14:39.899
You know what?
I think we'll wait here,

14:39.901 --> 14:44.495
- if that's okay with you, mister...
- Doctor.

14:44.496 --> 14:47.726
Dr. Arthur Isles.

14:52.575 --> 14:56.744
So you... [door closes]
work with Maura then?

14:56.779 --> 15:00.114
Yes. And you're in town?

15:00.166 --> 15:04.785
Yes.
Uh, I come to Boston regularly.

15:04.837 --> 15:07.421
When will Raya be back?

15:07.456 --> 15:10.040
Why would homicide detectives
be looking for Raya?

15:10.076 --> 15:12.409
Well, it's an ongoing investigation.

15:12.445 --> 15:15.379
The victim is Teddy Marshall,
A.K.A. Ten Mohs.

15:15.431 --> 15:20.434
- Oh. My.
- We know about the lawsuit.

15:20.469 --> 15:23.103
And you think Raya may have killed him.

15:23.139 --> 15:27.141
- Because of "the Darkness"?
- Excuse me?

15:27.193 --> 15:31.612
A diamond known as "the Darkness."
It's a 20-karat black diamond

15:31.647 --> 15:34.231
of great cultural importance
to the Sororo people.

15:34.283 --> 15:36.116
Uh, we just wanna ask
him a few questions.

15:36.152 --> 15:39.387
The diamond was stolen,
and the Sororo have taken

15:39.388 --> 15:42.623
legal and appropriate
steps to secure its return.

15:42.658 --> 15:46.577
Well... if that's the case, then
he has nothing to worry about.

15:46.629 --> 15:50.214
What... exactly is your
connection to all of this?

15:50.249 --> 15:53.250
I have lived and worked
on and off over 20 years

15:53.252 --> 15:54.835
with the Sororo people.

15:54.887 --> 15:57.421
They needed an intermediary
to pursue their legal case.

15:57.423 --> 15:59.256
I agreed to be that person.

15:59.308 --> 16:04.728
While it is true... that Raya had
motive to kill this Ten Mohs,

16:04.764 --> 16:08.732
- he didn't do it.
- How can you be so sure?

16:08.768 --> 16:12.603
Well, other than the sightseeing
trip he took an hour ago,

16:12.605 --> 16:15.739
he's been with me since
his arrival in Boston.

16:15.775 --> 16:19.276
- I'd have noticed something.
- All the same,

16:19.328 --> 16:21.411
I'd like you to give us a call
when he comes back.

16:21.447 --> 16:22.696
<i>Mm.</i>

16:25.201 --> 16:26.784
It's very nice to meet you, Dr. Isles.

16:26.786 --> 16:31.328
Even under the circumstances,
thank you kindly.

16:36.212 --> 16:38.345
You are not gonna believe
who I just ran into.

16:38.380 --> 16:39.713
- Tommy.
- No.

16:39.765 --> 16:44.468
- The family that adopted Jo Friday.
- No.

16:44.470 --> 16:46.854
- The chef that's building out the
restaurant down the street. - Mnh-mnh.

16:46.889 --> 16:48.856
- Tasha.
- Nope.

16:48.891 --> 16:51.308
That Sox fellow you like so much?

16:51.310 --> 16:54.812
<i>Okay, I obviously don't know.</i>

16:54.814 --> 16:59.683
I just ran into the other Dr. Isles.

17:00.953 --> 17:04.305
Oh. I'm glad.

17:04.740 --> 17:09.576
- That's it? You're glad?
- I assume nothing bad happened to him,

17:09.627 --> 17:12.462
or you would've been
much more compassionate.

17:12.498 --> 17:15.915
Your father is buddy-buddy
with a murder suspect.

17:15.968 --> 17:18.301
[continues typing]

17:18.337 --> 17:21.538
Okay, really? We're just not
gonna talk about this at all?

17:21.574 --> 17:24.846
- Talk about what?
- The fact that "your father"

17:24.881 --> 17:27.560
and "murder" are in the same sentence.

17:27.596 --> 17:29.646
We talk about murder all the time.

17:29.682 --> 17:32.225
Okay, it's obvious that something
is going on between you and

17:32.226 --> 17:34.768
your father and has been for
a long time... [closes laptop]

17:34.820 --> 17:37.771
because you have
absolutely no poker face.

17:37.823 --> 17:39.239
Yes, I do.

17:39.275 --> 17:43.443
- Have you ever beaten me at cards?
- No.

17:48.284 --> 17:50.834
Look, Maura, I just want you to know

17:50.870 --> 17:53.503
that, as your friend,
if you need me, I'm here.

17:56.375 --> 17:59.376
- He's a liar.
- Your father?

17:59.378 --> 18:01.795
Whatever he says, it's
never the whole truth.

18:01.847 --> 18:04.987
It may not even be part of the truth.

18:06.886 --> 18:09.269
[telephone rings in distance]

18:09.305 --> 18:10.721
I didn't find much.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.307
[sighs]
All right, show me what you got.

18:13.359 --> 18:16.593
He appears to be a busy guy
with a high tolerance for bugs.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.278
[computer beeping]

18:18.314 --> 18:22.532
<i>Hmm. Years of field research
in the Amazon rain forest.</i>

18:22.568 --> 18:24.868
Must've been hard on her
with him gone so much.

18:24.904 --> 18:27.988
Yeah. So what's his story
on this trip to Boston?

18:28.040 --> 18:30.657
His passport entered the country
at the same time as Raya's,

18:30.709 --> 18:32.326
and so far, it looks like
they've eaten all their meals

18:32.378 --> 18:35.329
in the hotel.
Raya doesn't have a cell phone,

18:35.381 --> 18:37.414
and we're not gonna get a
warrant for Dr. Isles', so...

18:37.466 --> 18:39.583
So we can't confirm if
they were in the hotel.

18:39.585 --> 18:41.585
Okay, what about the
security video at the club?

18:41.587 --> 18:43.303
Are either one of them on it?

18:43.339 --> 18:45.639
They aren't, but there are
no cameras in the kitchen,

18:45.674 --> 18:47.841
and the staff leaves the
door to the alley open.

18:47.893 --> 18:52.729
- Would've been easy enough to sneak in.
- Okay. Thanks.

18:52.765 --> 18:53.931
[beep]

18:53.983 --> 18:55.682
- Jane.
- Yeah?

18:55.734 --> 18:58.435
Three large checks just
hit Ten Mohs' bank account.

18:58.487 --> 19:02.906
- They're dated for today.
- Who's writing checks for a dead guy?

19:02.942 --> 19:06.743
Millie Juarez, the mother of his baby.
She lives on the East Side.

19:06.779 --> 19:09.446
Frankie and Korsak are
canvassing Raya's hotel.

19:09.448 --> 19:11.448
It's in that area.
I'll call 'em.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.604
How did she think she'd
get away with writing

19:16.605 --> 19:18.588
those checks to herself
after Ten Mohs was dead?

19:18.624 --> 19:19.957
Yeah. And be smart.
Always backdate your crime.

19:19.959 --> 19:22.342
[chuckles]
[dog barking in distance]

19:22.378 --> 19:24.378
You know... if you and I went rogue,

19:24.430 --> 19:26.596
I think we'd make pretty good criminals.

19:26.632 --> 19:27.798
- You?
- Yeah.

19:27.850 --> 19:29.967
The guy who hates to cut in line?

19:30.019 --> 19:32.674
Well, I'm not saying I'm
going to the dark side, but...

19:32.709 --> 19:34.438
I think I'd be pretty good at it.

19:34.473 --> 19:37.975
- If I wanted to, which I don't.
- What's that?

19:37.977 --> 19:40.310
- What?
- Somebody over there.

19:40.362 --> 19:42.643
Boston P.D.!

19:42.698 --> 19:45.899
<i>Hey!
[dog barking]</i>

19:45.951 --> 19:47.367
<i>Korsak: Drop it!</i>

19:47.403 --> 19:49.036
<i>Don't shoot! Don't shoot.</i>

19:49.071 --> 19:50.871
Why were you trying to
break into the house?

19:50.906 --> 19:53.490
Put your hands behind your head.

19:53.492 --> 19:56.710
Before Ten Mohs died,
he said, "shoot her."

19:56.745 --> 20:00.497
- You thought he meant Millie?
- She had been at the club earlier,

20:00.499 --> 20:01.882
shaking him down for
extra child support.

20:01.917 --> 20:03.500
Did he give it to her?
[handcuffs clicking]

20:03.552 --> 20:07.921
- Yeah, he agreed to give her 25% more.
- Get on up.

20:07.973 --> 20:09.506
Gave her a bunch of signed checks.

20:09.558 --> 20:12.476
Maybe those checks she cashed were
her way of getting what she's owed.

20:12.511 --> 20:15.395
Ten Mohs is dead. You still
thought you had to follow through?

20:15.431 --> 20:18.432
I wasn't gonna hurt her.
That baby needs his mom.

20:18.484 --> 20:20.984
I just thought I'd scare her a little.

20:21.020 --> 20:25.072
He said "shooter," not "shoot her."

20:25.107 --> 20:29.443
- What?
- Shooter. Like... oyster shooter.

20:29.495 --> 20:32.696
He must've realized one of them
was bad when his lips went numb.

20:32.698 --> 20:34.698
Oh, I... I thought he...

20:34.750 --> 20:38.085
Well, I-I didn't know
he meant... [sniffles]

20:38.120 --> 20:40.871
[crying]
I really miss Ten Mohs.

20:40.873 --> 20:45.810
[sighs]
[holsters gun]

20:51.216 --> 20:53.550
[sighs]

20:54.052 --> 20:59.806
- There you go.
- There I go. Where am I going?

20:59.858 --> 21:02.526
That is the D.N.A. signature

21:02.561 --> 21:05.062
of a freshwater Puffer
fish found in the Amazon.

21:05.064 --> 21:08.815
<i>That is the D.N.A. signature of the
Puffer fish that killed Ten Mohs.</i>

21:08.867 --> 21:10.534
Jeez! What the hell?!

21:10.569 --> 21:12.819
Puffer fish actually
taste quite delicious.

21:12.871 --> 21:15.489
What are you doing?!

21:15.541 --> 21:19.209
I was... looking for my pen?
Little tense, are we?

21:19.244 --> 21:20.911
Little weird, are we?

21:20.963 --> 21:23.846
It actually... [grunts]
just tastes like chicken.

21:24.800 --> 21:27.167
- Any more questions?
- So many.

21:27.219 --> 21:30.804
All right, fine, I'll be
getting back to my work then.

21:33.759 --> 21:35.926
I mean, I don't wanna
paint the entire country

21:35.928 --> 21:38.478
with just one brush...
but the Scottish guy? Weird.

21:38.514 --> 21:42.649
- That's not important right now.
- Okay. [types]

21:42.684 --> 21:44.768
[beep]
Read this.

33:23.824 --> 33:25.573
[beep]

33:25.575 --> 33:27.325
[beeps]
Oh.

33:27.377 --> 33:28.626
Ten Mohs and Tory were dating.
[beeping]

33:28.662 --> 33:32.580
<i>- Frankie: Lot of calls, lot of texts.
- Korsak: Then they trailed off.</i>

33:32.582 --> 33:34.749
<i>Jane: That's not enough to arrest her.</i>

33:34.801 --> 33:38.303
So Ten Mohs was mixing
business with pleasure.

33:38.338 --> 33:39.804
That's trouble.

33:39.840 --> 33:41.422
Not as much as mixing
pleasure with pleasure.

33:41.474 --> 33:44.642
Perhaps Ten Mohs didn't tell Tory
the relationship was over.

33:44.678 --> 33:49.147
A girl could get mighty upset
if she found out on her own.

33:49.182 --> 33:52.767
- Why are you here?
- Ah. A list of Puffer fish recipes.

33:52.819 --> 33:56.404
- Don't try them without a license.
- I wasn't planning on it.

33:56.439 --> 33:59.407
Yeah, neither was I, but then...

34:00.443 --> 34:04.538
- well, that's a... story for another day. [chuckles]
- Promise?

34:04.658 --> 34:06.497
That's actually a list of all
the people who do have a license

34:06.533 --> 34:08.416
to import Amazonian Puffer fish.

34:08.451 --> 34:12.670
- As requested.
- Thank you.

34:16.458 --> 34:19.510
Well, let's go see Tory.
Send her picture to all the importers,

34:19.545 --> 34:21.846
- see if she bought a fish.
- Uh, you better hurry.

34:21.882 --> 34:24.572
- Why?
- I called her about an hour ago

34:24.607 --> 34:26.118
and told her we might need to ask her

34:26.119 --> 34:28.437
- some questions about Karina.
- Who she knows is innocent.

34:28.438 --> 34:30.605
Well, go to her house, make
sure she's still in town.

34:30.639 --> 34:32.357
I'll check her bank records
and recent purchases.

34:32.391 --> 34:35.510
- Maybe she bought a plane ticket.
- All right. Let's go.

34:45.800 --> 34:47.632
Let's try around back.

34:53.591 --> 34:55.090
[door bell chimes]

34:55.126 --> 34:58.594
Oh. When I travel,
I usually pack clothes.

34:58.629 --> 35:00.563
What are you doing here?

35:00.598 --> 35:01.964
Of course, if you bring jewelry,
you can trade it for clothes

35:01.999 --> 35:04.333
- or a toothbrush.
- Oh, no, no, no.

35:04.368 --> 35:05.651
Where she's going, they'll
give her a toothbrush.

35:05.686 --> 35:07.770
You know, if you're
going to the airport...

35:07.772 --> 35:09.905
[strained voice] you are
gonna pay extra for this one.

35:09.941 --> 35:12.942
- I'm not going anywhere.
- The jewels are traveling alone?

35:12.994 --> 35:14.777
Given all that's been happening,

35:14.829 --> 35:17.863
I thought it best to close
up and secure the inventory.

35:17.915 --> 35:20.666
You never told us you
were dating Ten Mohs.

35:20.701 --> 35:23.786
- A lot of people dated Ten Mohs.
- Yes, but Karina was a threat.

35:23.788 --> 35:25.004
<i>[cell phone vibrates]
She loved him.</i>

35:25.039 --> 35:28.791
- So did you.
- Loving Ten Mohs isn't a crime.

35:28.843 --> 35:33.846
- Where is your aquarium?
- I don't have an aquarium.

35:33.881 --> 35:37.099
The clerk from the store I.D.'d you.

35:37.134 --> 35:39.351
He said that you bought 20 Puffer fish.

35:39.387 --> 35:40.886
<i>You're under arrest for the
murder of Teddy Marshall.</i>

35:40.938 --> 35:44.379
Here's your nice, shiny, new bracelet.

35:44.942 --> 35:47.810
Allow me.
[handcuffs click]

35:47.812 --> 35:50.563
<i>You have the right to remain silent.</i>

35:54.552 --> 35:56.385
[door open]

35:56.421 --> 35:59.338
Ms. Sororo, you're free to go.

35:59.340 --> 36:01.891
[door closes]

36:01.926 --> 36:05.311
- Is my dad waiting for me?
- Yes. He's in the lobby.

36:05.346 --> 36:08.180
He'll sit there for days if he has to.

36:08.232 --> 36:10.349
<i>The Sororo don't use the future tense.</i>

36:10.351 --> 36:16.489
Now is forever, and that's a problem.

36:16.524 --> 36:20.693
Someday, I'll be the
leader of the Sororo.

36:20.695 --> 36:25.247
I think about that...
the future. He doesn't.

36:25.283 --> 36:27.249
So you think he's waiting
down there to argue with you?

36:27.285 --> 36:30.536
- Yes.
- You've made hard choices before.

36:30.588 --> 36:33.622
I'm not sure I believe that's
what you're really worried about.

36:33.674 --> 36:38.844
I was going to tell my father about
my relationship with Ten Mohs...

36:38.880 --> 36:41.680
[inhales deeply]
after the trial.

36:41.716 --> 36:43.599
Now you never need to tell him.

36:43.634 --> 36:48.554
- You think he deserves to know the truth?
- I don't have a daughter.

36:48.556 --> 36:53.693
But if I did, I'd want
her to be straight with me.

36:54.395 --> 36:57.313
You know?
Go talk to him.

36:57.365 --> 37:01.304
We really need him out of the lobby.

37:09.710 --> 37:11.377
<i>Janie, we can make this work,</i>

37:11.412 --> 37:13.879
but we just have to lay
down some ground rules.

37:13.915 --> 37:15.915
- Ground rules?
- Yeah.

37:15.967 --> 37:18.667
- Like for instance, see that drawer?
- Yeah.

37:18.719 --> 37:20.920
- Don't open it.
- Okay.

37:22.723 --> 37:25.508
Ah! See?

37:25.560 --> 37:27.977
That... was a test.
You failed.

37:28.012 --> 37:31.313
Now you will never know the location
of my secret drawer.

37:31.349 --> 37:33.432
- Can I use your computer?
- Of course.

37:33.484 --> 37:35.434
Good. I'm gonna stay at a hotel.

37:35.436 --> 37:37.319
No, no, no.
Stop, stop, stop.

37:37.355 --> 37:39.355
Look, we can do this.
We just have a few more rules.

37:39.407 --> 37:40.606
- All right?
- [whispers] Okay.

37:40.608 --> 37:41.941
Dishes in the sink, rinsed.

37:41.943 --> 37:45.444
If you finish my cereal, replace it.
And please...

37:45.446 --> 37:48.948
don't dry your...
brassiere in my shower.

37:48.950 --> 37:53.953
Okay, please don't ever say
the word "brassiere," Francis.

37:54.005 --> 37:56.956
- Don't call me that.
- Fine, Franklin.

37:57.008 --> 38:00.843
That's not even my name.
[knock on door]

38:00.878 --> 38:04.338
Well, can I open the door,
or is there a rule against that, too?

38:08.803 --> 38:10.052
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:10.104 --> 38:11.637
- Hey!
- Glad you're here.

38:11.689 --> 38:13.973
You can help me find
Frankie's porn drawer.

38:13.975 --> 38:15.608
[door closes]
It's a secret drawer.

38:15.643 --> 38:16.976
That means it's weird porn.

38:17.028 --> 38:18.811
- Hey, Maura.
- Hi.

38:18.813 --> 38:20.613
- Don't touch her brassiere.
- Oh, my god.

38:20.648 --> 38:21.947
Why would he touch my brassiere?

38:21.983 --> 38:24.867
- He's got a thing.
- I don't have a thing.

38:24.902 --> 38:28.988
- Can I talk to you? Privately.
- Yeah. Sure.

38:29.040 --> 38:32.658
Um, please, come into my
secret tiny, tiny, room.

38:32.660 --> 38:34.326
That's not it!

38:34.378 --> 38:38.831
You better hide your
secret tiny, tiny porn.

38:42.637 --> 38:44.670
Um...
Wow. You weren't kidding.

38:44.672 --> 38:47.423
No, I was not.

38:49.093 --> 38:51.249
Okay. What's up?

38:52.680 --> 38:54.763
What I say cannot leave this room.

38:54.815 --> 38:57.982
What you say cannot fit in this room.

39:00.855 --> 39:06.492
When I was 14, my best
friend, uh, Carice Jaquard...

39:06.527 --> 39:07.860
she lived next door.

39:07.912 --> 39:10.029
And one day, she didn't
show up for school.

39:10.081 --> 39:13.115
So on my way home,
I thought I would stop by,

39:13.167 --> 39:16.535
see if she wanted to know
what the homework was.

39:16.537 --> 39:18.871
Mnh, she didn't.

39:18.923 --> 39:20.756
I'm sorry.

39:20.791 --> 39:26.045
So I knocked on the door.
Nobody answered.

39:26.097 --> 39:29.548
I went inside, I went up the stairs,

39:29.550 --> 39:32.801
and I saw Mrs. Jaquard's door open.

39:32.853 --> 39:36.689
I could see her inside,
lying on the bed,

39:36.724 --> 39:38.891
pulling up the sheets...

39:39.193 --> 39:43.672
as Arthur came out,
buttoning up his shirt.

39:45.700 --> 39:53.038
Up until then, he was...
a hero to me.

39:53.074 --> 39:55.207
He broke my heart.

39:55.242 --> 39:58.794
[clicks tongue]
Oh, Maura.

39:58.829 --> 40:02.414
So he...

40:02.466 --> 40:06.144
begged me not to say anything.

40:07.054 --> 40:09.138
I didn't, to anyone.

40:11.509 --> 40:14.677
But not telling my mother...

40:14.729 --> 40:17.513
keeping it inside, it...

40:17.565 --> 40:23.152
it feels like that lie is still inside,
like, living in there.

40:23.187 --> 40:25.938
I think that's why
I have such a hard time

40:25.940 --> 40:28.941
not telling the truth,
why I break out in hives.

40:28.943 --> 40:33.112
Well... I love that you can't tell a lie.

40:33.114 --> 40:37.750
- But you think I'm a coward.
- What? No. Why?

40:37.785 --> 40:43.789
Because I'm avoiding him,
not confronting him about it.

40:43.841 --> 40:49.549
Maura, I live in a 2x3 room in
order to avoid living with my mother.

40:49.584 --> 40:51.347
[both chuckle]

40:53.300 --> 40:57.770
You were a child,
and he put you in a terrible position.

41:01.642 --> 41:03.642
But it was so long ago.

41:03.694 --> 41:05.644
[sighs heavily]

41:05.646 --> 41:08.147
You want me to shoot him?

41:08.149 --> 41:13.569
- I do. I really do.
- Okay.

41:13.621 --> 41:15.821
But instead, maybe I'll
talk to him first. [chuckles]

41:15.823 --> 41:17.956
Fine, but let me know
if you change your mind.

41:17.992 --> 41:20.876
We'll see how the talk goes.

41:20.911 --> 41:24.810
Otherwise, you are very good
at shooting my relatives.

41:24.965 --> 41:27.787
[giggles]

41:29.003 --> 41:30.302
Let's go find Frankie's secret drawer.

41:30.337 --> 41:32.171
<i>[exhales deeply]
Frankie: I heard that!</i>

41:32.223 --> 41:33.722
[laughs]

41:33.758 --> 41:35.924
Oh, we're gonna have so much fun.
[laughs]

41:35.976 --> 41:37.638
Come on!
