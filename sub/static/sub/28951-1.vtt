WEBVTT

02:23.943 --> 02:25.283
- Yeah!

02:32.283 --> 02:33.687
- Violet called me.

02:35.687 --> 02:38.639
You want the police up in here
knockin' on your door next?

02:53.639 --> 02:55.577
If you're gonna shoot
me, get it over with.

02:58.577 --> 02:59.777
- Lena!

02:59.777 --> 03:03.382
- That's that shit
I gotta deal with.

03:03.382 --> 03:05.419
I'm here, honey.

03:08.419 --> 03:09.955
Look, do you have another room?

03:10.955 --> 03:13.258
- I don't sit here
and watch her fuck.

03:13.258 --> 03:15.529
- Just go there, and I'll
be there in a minute.

03:17.529 --> 03:18.764
- You gonna get my
bitch out the bathroom?

03:18.764 --> 03:19.734
- That's why I'm here.

03:21.734 --> 03:22.736
- All right.

03:24.736 --> 03:25.613
103.

03:34.613 --> 03:35.014
- Violet?

03:36.014 --> 03:36.961
He's gone now.

03:49.961 --> 03:51.768
What happened?

03:55.768 --> 03:56.636
- This trick,

03:56.636 --> 03:59.773
he put some weird
shit on his balls.

04:00.773 --> 04:04.043
So I said, what is that shit?

04:04.043 --> 04:05.845
He said, don't worry about it.

04:06.845 --> 04:09.883
I said, fuck yeah I'm
gonna worry about it.

04:10.883 --> 04:12.318
So he goes and tells Ronnie.

04:13.318 --> 04:14.687
Ronnie gets mad,

04:15.687 --> 04:17.658
'cause I embarrassed
the customer.

04:19.658 --> 04:20.696
And he hits me.

04:23.696 --> 04:24.499
- All right.

04:27.499 --> 04:29.380
You just wait here, all right?

04:42.380 --> 04:44.382
- Bitch ready to
go back to work?

04:44.382 --> 04:46.952
- Actually, she wants
to come with me.

04:46.952 --> 04:47.886
- Fuck that.

04:47.886 --> 04:49.088
- Come on, you and me both know,

04:49.088 --> 04:50.488
forcing a girl to stay in this--

04:50.488 --> 04:51.857
- Bitch chose up.

04:51.857 --> 04:52.791
She can make her money.

04:52.791 --> 04:53.925
- But this is just the start.

04:53.925 --> 04:55.127
You keep her here like this,

04:55.127 --> 04:57.031
she's just gonna run
off more and more money.

04:59.031 --> 05:00.699
You really want a underage bitch

05:00.699 --> 05:01.899
who ain't 100% with
it working for you?

05:01.899 --> 05:03.901
- Said she was 18.

05:03.901 --> 05:05.639
- Nigger, did she
show you some ID?

05:07.639 --> 05:09.841
Look, you thinkin'
about this all wrong.

05:09.841 --> 05:11.543
You could keep here
if you want to,

05:11.543 --> 05:13.978
but what happens when next
time she don't call me?

05:13.978 --> 05:15.680
- These girls can't
just come and go.

05:15.680 --> 05:16.714
- I know.

05:16.714 --> 05:17.783
- Ain't no fuckin' temp agency.

05:17.783 --> 05:18.892
- I know.

05:27.892 --> 05:30.896
- You know what I
gotta do, right?

05:30.896 --> 05:31.865
- Yeah,

05:32.865 --> 05:33.435
and that's fine.

05:41.607 --> 05:42.178
- You want out?

05:46.178 --> 05:47.050
You better say something ho.

05:52.050 --> 05:53.824
You got this bitch
to come get you.

05:58.824 --> 05:59.958
- Lena!

05:59.958 --> 06:00.194
- Don't be coming up here,

06:02.194 --> 06:03.862
and taking my girls.

06:03.862 --> 06:04.696
You got that?

06:04.696 --> 06:05.531
- Got it.

06:05.531 --> 06:06.665
- You got that?

06:06.665 --> 06:07.767
- Got it.

06:08.767 --> 06:10.636
- Go ahead bitch, leave.

06:10.636 --> 06:11.569
But don't be calling me

06:11.569 --> 06:12.971
when you ain't got nowhere to go

06:12.971 --> 06:14.540
because they kicked
your ass out.

06:14.540 --> 06:17.144
I helped you, and
you're gonna turn on me.

06:19.144 --> 06:21.846
Get the fuck out of
here, you square bitch.

06:21.846 --> 06:22.889
Go!

07:39.992 --> 07:41.093
- You okay?

07:42.093 --> 07:43.934
- You okay?

07:48.934 --> 07:51.738
- I'll do what I have
to do to get a girl out.

08:04.016 --> 08:05.651
- This is good.

08:06.651 --> 08:08.221
I thought you'd be all
Marvin Gaye, or something.

08:10.221 --> 08:12.124
- How old do you think I am?

08:12.124 --> 08:14.026
- I'm saying like, attitude.

08:15.026 --> 08:19.298
You got that 70's Soul
Train, or Foxy Brown, 'tude.

08:20.298 --> 08:22.036
- Okay, I can live with that.

08:24.036 --> 08:25.170
A girl came to my house,

08:25.170 --> 08:27.940
she got into music production.

08:27.940 --> 08:30.108
This is one of the
projects she worked on.

08:30.108 --> 08:31.312
It's just some indie stuff.

08:33.312 --> 08:34.217
- Cool.

08:40.217 --> 08:41.955
I was gonna be a singer.

08:42.955 --> 08:43.889
- Really?

08:44.889 --> 08:45.028
Let me hear something.

08:59.270 --> 09:02.043
♪ Yeah yeah yeah ♪

09:06.043 --> 09:07.048
- You have a really nice voice.

09:10.048 --> 09:10.250
- Thanks.

09:13.250 --> 09:14.019
- Look, not to get all
up in your business

09:15.019 --> 09:16.758
but singing's a
real possibility.

09:19.758 --> 09:21.626
You just gotta decide how
long you're gonna spend

09:21.626 --> 09:24.739
making somebody else a
star instead of yourself.

09:34.373 --> 09:35.743
- Quit smiling.

09:37.743 --> 09:38.376
that's dumb.

09:38.376 --> 09:40.979
- Looks bad, looks bad.

09:40.979 --> 09:43.216
Oh, you know Justin wants to
meet tomorrow after ballet.

09:45.216 --> 09:47.119
- Have you even seen him?

09:47.119 --> 09:48.053
- Yeah, of course.

09:49.053 --> 09:50.187
We Skype all the time,

09:50.187 --> 09:53.360
and I don't know,
he's such a cutie.

09:56.360 --> 09:58.399
Don't tell anybody I told you.

10:00.399 --> 10:02.000
- But I think you
should tell your mom.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.303
- I mean, he's a senior.

10:05.303 --> 10:07.239
- So you're not gonna
tell her because of that?

10:07.239 --> 10:09.408
- I don't know, it's not
like even a real date.

10:10.408 --> 10:11.878
- Yes it is.

10:12.878 --> 10:14.178
That's a date.

10:14.178 --> 10:15.179
You're going on a date.

10:15.179 --> 10:16.014
- Okay okay, well,

10:17.014 --> 10:18.115
she won't let me
have a boyfriend,

10:18.115 --> 10:19.452
so what else can I do?

10:20.452 --> 10:22.888
Go ahead, what can I do?

10:22.888 --> 10:25.090
Nothing.

10:25.090 --> 10:26.096
- Dani?
- Yeah, Mom.

10:32.096 --> 10:33.365
- Hey.

10:34.365 --> 10:35.767
It's time for bed.

10:35.767 --> 10:37.068
- But it's Friday.

10:37.068 --> 10:38.870
- And you know that
you have ballet

10:38.870 --> 10:40.105
first thing in the morning.

10:40.105 --> 10:42.407
- Yeah, and then piano
in the afternoon,

10:42.407 --> 10:44.842
and then swimming on Sundays.

10:44.842 --> 10:46.046
- I gotta go anyway, so.

10:48.046 --> 10:48.482
Sorry.

10:51.482 --> 10:52.384
- Bye.

10:52.384 --> 10:53.485
- Thank you Miss Walker.

10:53.485 --> 10:54.322
- Bye babe.
- Bye.

10:58.322 --> 10:59.759
- How's it going?

11:00.759 --> 11:03.260
- Just that I have to
finish up this last diagram.

11:03.260 --> 11:04.462
- Need any help?

11:04.462 --> 11:05.133
- No, I'm okay.

11:08.133 --> 11:09.134
- Well, what is it?

11:09.134 --> 11:10.937
- Just AP chemistry.

11:12.937 --> 11:15.072
- Well, I can tell
you I would be

11:15.072 --> 11:16.514
zero help to you
in that, my dear.

11:22.514 --> 11:24.917
I am so proud of you.

11:25.917 --> 11:28.086
And I know that your father is--

11:28.086 --> 11:28.022
- Mom.

11:31.022 --> 11:31.524
Thank you.

11:33.524 --> 11:34.095
- Okay.

11:37.095 --> 11:37.032
Okay.

11:41.032 --> 11:42.333
Goodnight baby.

11:42.333 --> 11:43.171
- Goodnight.

12:10.461 --> 12:12.898
- Police
received an anonymous call

12:12.898 --> 12:14.899
about a body burning,
right here they say,

12:14.899 --> 12:16.868
on 94th Street and Broadway.

12:16.868 --> 12:19.370
When police arrived,
they believed the
victim to be female,

12:19.370 --> 12:21.572
but the body has not
yet been identified.

12:21.572 --> 12:23.307
People in the community--

12:23.307 --> 12:24.241
- That's Nicki.

12:24.241 --> 12:25.342
- Oh my God, that's Nicki.

12:25.342 --> 12:26.546
- That's Nicki.

12:27.546 --> 12:30.048
- Oh my God!

12:30.048 --> 12:31.316
- Hey, what is going on?

12:31.316 --> 12:33.418
- Dominick, he did that!

12:33.418 --> 12:35.519
- Nicki's pimp put a
green light on her.

12:35.519 --> 12:38.490
Burned her alive right on the
street in front of everybody.

12:38.490 --> 12:40.392
- I know that girl,
they're coming for me next.

12:40.392 --> 12:42.394
- Look look, nobody
is coming for you.

12:42.394 --> 12:44.129
Everybody just relax.

12:44.129 --> 12:46.331
Calm down, what are you even
doing, looking at the computer,

12:46.331 --> 12:49.333
you know the rules about
looking at the computer.

12:49.333 --> 12:50.001
- I'm sorry, it's my fault.

12:51.001 --> 12:51.106
I said it was okay.

12:56.106 --> 12:58.076
- He's got friends,
and Lena I'm scared.

12:58.076 --> 12:59.376
- Hey don't be
scared, look at me.

12:59.376 --> 13:01.980
If Lena's got you,
nobody is coming for you.

13:02.980 --> 13:04.615
Listen, all of you
are gonna be okay.

13:04.615 --> 13:05.549
I am here.

13:05.549 --> 13:06.018
- Let's get you settled, okay?

13:07.018 --> 13:08.989
- Just calm down.
- I'm Crystal.

13:10.989 --> 13:11.424
- I got you.

13:16.528 --> 13:17.469
You're all right.

13:24.469 --> 13:26.538
- So this is where
you'll be staying.

13:27.538 --> 13:29.039
It gets a little
warm here at night,

13:29.039 --> 13:31.292
so sometimes we like to
leave the window open.

13:47.292 --> 13:51.667
You know this is the scar
that got me out of the life.

13:55.667 --> 13:57.639
You know the night
that I got this scar,

14:00.639 --> 14:02.673
I threw myself down
on my knees in my room

14:02.673 --> 14:05.176
and I just, I prayed,

14:05.176 --> 14:07.446
I didn't even know who
I as praying to but,

14:08.446 --> 14:09.518
I prayed for a way out.

14:13.518 --> 14:17.690
And, a week later,
that's when I met Lena.

14:18.690 --> 14:20.062
And I've been here ever since.

14:24.062 --> 14:25.464
But what about you?

14:26.464 --> 14:27.368
What'd your pimp promise you?

14:30.368 --> 14:33.270
- My situation's a
little bit different,

14:33.270 --> 14:36.173
because we're actually
in a relationship.

14:36.173 --> 14:38.417
Yeah, right now we're
just having some problems.

14:45.417 --> 14:46.096
- I see.

15:53.250 --> 15:54.522
- Dani?

15:57.522 --> 15:58.556
- What?

15:58.556 --> 16:00.057
- I'm Justin's homeboy.

16:00.057 --> 16:01.525
He's running a little late.

16:01.525 --> 16:03.197
He told me to come swoop you
up, and take you to the mall.

16:07.197 --> 16:08.476
- No, I'm sorry.

16:42.466 --> 16:46.576
- Dani, I'm home
early, wanna get lunch?

16:51.576 --> 16:52.649
Dani?

16:58.649 --> 16:59.553
Dani?

17:01.553 --> 17:02.821
Dani?

17:02.821 --> 17:05.490
Hey Dani, it's your mom.

17:05.490 --> 17:07.325
I got home early from work,

17:07.325 --> 17:09.358
thought maybe we could go
to our favorite lunch spot,

17:09.358 --> 17:10.663
but you're not here.

17:12.663 --> 17:14.731
Just wondering where you are.

17:14.731 --> 17:19.604
And give me a call back
please, sooner than later.

17:19.604 --> 17:21.405
All right, I love you.

17:21.405 --> 17:25.541
Hi, this is Sharon,
I'm Dani's Mom,

17:25.541 --> 17:27.243
a friend of Haley's.

17:27.243 --> 17:29.513
Hi, I'm sorry to bother you.

17:29.513 --> 17:31.382
Is Haley around?

17:31.382 --> 17:32.450
Haley?

17:32.450 --> 17:34.719
Hi, it's Sharon.

17:34.719 --> 17:37.689
Yeah hi, I was wondering,

17:37.689 --> 17:39.857
have you seen Dani,
or is she with you?

17:39.857 --> 17:41.593
I can't find her anywhere,

17:41.593 --> 17:44.534
and I really need
to talk to her.

17:49.534 --> 17:52.271
You're saying she never
went to dance class today?

17:54.271 --> 17:56.708
Haley, I need you
tell me exactly

17:56.708 --> 17:58.612
the last place that you saw her.

18:00.612 --> 18:01.657
Hold on.

18:13.657 --> 18:14.364
Who the hell is Justin?

18:21.465 --> 18:23.839
- Get your black ass in here.

18:28.839 --> 18:30.775
This fuckin' bitch bit me.

18:30.775 --> 18:32.376
Something funny?

18:32.376 --> 18:35.212
- Like I was paying cash--

18:35.212 --> 18:38.883
- Bitch, don't you ever
take me as a goddamn joke,

18:38.883 --> 18:40.351
you hear me?

18:40.351 --> 18:41.185
- Yes, daddy.

18:41.185 --> 18:42.554
- What?

18:42.554 --> 18:45.856
I say call me king master daddy.

18:45.856 --> 18:47.366
- Yes, king master daddy.

18:56.366 --> 18:58.471
- Now what the fuck is going on?

19:01.471 --> 19:04.442
What did I tell you
about touching my girls?

19:04.442 --> 19:05.542
- That bitch was out of line.

19:05.542 --> 19:07.846
- What did I tell you
about calling them bitches?

19:08.846 --> 19:10.376
How come I have to keep
repeating myself, you dumb fuck?

19:39.376 --> 19:41.378
- I can't calm down Mom,

19:41.378 --> 19:44.648
the police said there's nothing
they can do for 24 hours.

19:44.648 --> 19:45.452
24 hours!

19:47.452 --> 19:48.653
I could have killed
them for suggesting

19:48.653 --> 19:49.020
teenage girls run off with
their boyfriends all the time.

19:50.020 --> 19:51.624
That is not Dani.

19:52.624 --> 19:53.558
It's not her.

20:10.842 --> 20:12.390
Mom, I'll call you back, okay?

20:59.723 --> 21:02.528
- My boyfriend gave me
an iPhone, and a TV.

21:03.528 --> 21:05.863
Sometimes we'd
just sit in my room

21:05.863 --> 21:07.898
all day and watch cartoons.

21:07.898 --> 21:09.599
We didn't mess
around or nothin',

21:09.599 --> 21:12.103
it'd just be the two of us.

21:12.103 --> 21:13.904
- He gave 'em to you?

21:13.904 --> 21:16.075
- Well, I think
they were a loan.

21:17.075 --> 21:19.744
But we all gotta earn our keep.

21:20.744 --> 21:22.781
- I'm just saying, it ain't a
gift if it's a loan.

21:24.781 --> 21:25.784
- I guess.

21:26.784 --> 21:28.122
- Did you have to
work to pay it off?

21:31.122 --> 21:33.893
How long did it take
for you to pay it off?

21:35.893 --> 21:38.496
- Well, we gotta pay
for the phone bill, too.

21:38.496 --> 21:39.865
And for the cable.

21:40.865 --> 21:41.933
- I'm not judging you.

21:42.933 --> 21:44.469
I am you.

21:44.469 --> 21:45.538
I'm all of you.

21:47.538 --> 21:49.540
I was on the track
just like you,

21:50.540 --> 21:52.410
and now we're all here.

21:52.410 --> 21:53.810
I'm just trying to point out

21:53.810 --> 21:56.847
that this is how they sometimes
keep control over you.

21:56.847 --> 21:57.715
They'll give you things,

21:57.715 --> 22:00.852
or buy you things,
real nice things,

22:00.852 --> 22:03.820
but then they set it up to where
you can't never pay it off,

22:03.820 --> 22:05.923
and that's how they own you.

22:05.923 --> 22:07.159
And that ain't love.

22:08.159 --> 22:09.894
Ownership ain't love.

22:10.894 --> 22:12.130
I know you all thing
your boyfriends

22:12.130 --> 22:14.566
ain't scared of nothing,
that they invincible.

22:19.703 --> 22:20.904
But you all are
the ones out there

22:20.904 --> 22:22.973
on the track, every night,

22:22.973 --> 22:26.911
risking your bodies and
your freedom, your lives.

22:26.911 --> 22:28.881
So who's the real coward?

22:29.881 --> 22:31.915
Pimp's only scared
of two things,

22:31.915 --> 22:33.851
losing his money.

22:33.851 --> 22:34.684
- Hell yeah.

22:34.684 --> 22:35.786
- Right?

22:35.786 --> 22:37.622
'Cause they sure be standing
outside that motel room

22:37.622 --> 22:39.892
waiting on you to come
and get that money first.

22:40.892 --> 22:42.759
They scared of
losing their money,

22:42.759 --> 22:44.730
and life in the penitentiary,

22:45.730 --> 22:48.665
'cause you can't pimp
in the penitentiary.

22:48.665 --> 22:50.434
Think about it.

22:50.434 --> 22:52.538
We have more power than we know.

22:53.538 --> 22:54.839
- So there's a lady
here to see you.

22:55.839 --> 22:57.928
- Can you take over?
- Yeah.

23:16.928 --> 23:18.830
- What are you doing here?

23:19.830 --> 23:21.065
- I thought--

23:21.065 --> 23:22.171
- How'd you even
know I was here?

23:27.171 --> 23:28.141
- Dani's missing.

23:30.141 --> 23:30.108
- Dani?

23:32.108 --> 23:33.243
The goddaughter that
I've been banned

23:33.243 --> 23:35.145
from ever seeing again?

23:35.145 --> 23:36.881
- She was talking to
this older man online,

23:36.881 --> 23:38.115
and then they met up,

23:38.115 --> 23:39.549
and now I can't
find her anywhere,

23:39.549 --> 23:41.954
and I am so scared
that something,

23:43.954 --> 23:46.190
I thought maybe you
could help that,

23:46.190 --> 23:47.657
you might know something about--

23:47.657 --> 23:50.694
- Of course, yeah,
'cause a high school ho

23:50.694 --> 23:53.968
would know where your teenage
daughter ran off to, right?

24:02.006 --> 24:04.976
- No Lena, I need
your help, please.

24:04.976 --> 24:07.211
- And I needed you too.

24:07.211 --> 24:08.880
Now if you'll excuse me,

24:08.880 --> 24:10.567
I actually have work to do.

24:29.567 --> 24:30.868
- Here, take these.

24:31.868 --> 24:33.710
They'll make you feel better.

24:39.710 --> 24:41.313
Oh baby, what?

24:42.313 --> 24:43.083
No no no no.

24:46.083 --> 24:47.819
Look at that face.

24:49.819 --> 24:51.089
Look at your beautiful eyes.

24:53.089 --> 24:55.058
They're drying up anyway.

24:55.058 --> 24:56.963
Like sunshine.

24:59.963 --> 25:00.667
- Who are you?

25:03.667 --> 25:05.770
Where is Justin?

25:06.770 --> 25:09.673
- I'm Eve baby.

25:09.673 --> 25:12.143
And I'm Justin, too.

25:12.143 --> 25:14.017
I'm the only thing
you'll ever need.

25:20.017 --> 25:21.051
Come on, mama.

25:21.051 --> 25:22.657
Take the pills.

25:27.657 --> 25:28.230
Come on.

25:34.230 --> 25:35.135
There you go.

25:39.135 --> 25:40.807
Good girl, good girl.

25:42.807 --> 25:44.642
Come here, mama.

25:44.642 --> 25:45.722
I got you.

26:02.125 --> 26:03.060
- Bitch, give
me the money shot.

26:03.060 --> 26:05.263
Shoot that ass up,
tricks like that shit.

26:07.263 --> 26:09.634
- Come here baby, come.

26:09.634 --> 26:11.369
This is where you'll
be sleeping tonight.

26:34.991 --> 26:38.762
- Violet, do you know
who Harriet Tubman is?

26:38.762 --> 26:42.769
- Yeah, the lady who
freed all the slaves.

26:45.769 --> 26:46.071
- Right.

26:48.071 --> 26:50.008
You know she said she could
have freed a thousand more,

26:51.008 --> 26:52.211
if only they'd known
they were slaves.

26:54.211 --> 26:56.146
- I'm not going back to him.

26:56.146 --> 26:57.932
- Goodnight, Violet.

27:14.932 --> 27:15.766
Thank you.

27:15.766 --> 27:17.105
- You're welcome.

27:21.105 --> 27:22.107
Seven times, right?

27:24.107 --> 27:25.809
- Yeah, we only have
to put with this

27:25.809 --> 27:28.884
five more times before she
stops trying to go back.

27:34.884 --> 27:35.020
- Miss Lena?

27:37.020 --> 27:39.224
Do you know why I
decided to stay here?

27:41.224 --> 27:43.259
It's because you
said that you would

27:43.259 --> 27:44.200
never leave a girl behind.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.227
Ain't a lot of people
that would do that for us.

29:04.842 --> 29:07.012
keep my phone near me and wait.

29:09.012 --> 29:11.116
- It takes 48 hours
to turn a girl out.

29:13.116 --> 29:13.116
- What?

29:13.951 --> 29:15.423

Thank you for helping me.

29:23.928 --> 29:25.496

29:25.496 --> 29:26.987
I'm helping Dani.

29:49.987 --> 29:51.258
- What are you looking for?

29:54.258 --> 29:55.126
Dani is a good kid.

29:57.126 --> 29:59.641
- The girls in my house
are very creative.

30:10.641 --> 30:12.013
- She never
hides anything from me.

30:17.013 --> 30:18.393
- Don't freak out,
it's just a journal.

30:29.393 --> 30:30.429
Justin her boyfriend?

30:32.429 --> 30:34.163
- No.

30:34.163 --> 30:36.367
Justin is the guy that
she was talking to online.

30:37.367 --> 30:38.415
- Show me.

30:59.222 --> 31:00.157
- You hungry?

31:01.157 --> 31:02.061
Eve said to feed you.

31:05.061 --> 31:06.544
Bitch, get the fuck up.

31:36.426 --> 31:38.127
- I'm not gonna do it,

31:38.127 --> 31:40.130
what you girls do.

31:40.130 --> 31:42.299
- Look, Eve don't
like no talk back.

31:43.299 --> 31:44.637
Eat.

31:47.637 --> 31:48.606
- They can't make me.

31:50.606 --> 31:52.510
- That's what they all say here.

31:54.510 --> 31:56.313
- But what about your families?

31:56.313 --> 31:57.448
- What family?

31:57.448 --> 31:58.982
This is our family.

31:58.982 --> 32:01.317
King master daddy takes
us to get our nails done,

32:01.317 --> 32:02.553
our hair done,

32:02.553 --> 32:04.488
and he take us to
get burgers, bitch.

32:04.488 --> 32:05.689
All I got at the house

32:05.689 --> 32:07.392
is my mama's boyfriend
trying to fuck me.

32:08.392 --> 32:09.494
Later for that shit.

32:11.494 --> 32:14.330
- Can I have some
more water, please?

32:14.330 --> 32:16.266
- Bitch, do we look
like the maids?

32:16.266 --> 32:17.605
- Get your own fucking water.

32:22.605 --> 32:23.773
What the fuck is wrong
with that white ho?

32:23.773 --> 32:25.442
- She thinks she better than us.

32:25.442 --> 32:29.234
- She better fall in line.

32:51.234 --> 32:52.301
- Whoa whoa, hey.

32:52.301 --> 32:53.136
Where do you think we're going,

32:53.136 --> 32:54.271
some red carpet event?

33:13.690 --> 33:15.059
- I still have mine, too.

33:16.059 --> 33:16.299
- Yeah?

33:23.299 --> 33:25.169
- What the hell are you doing?

33:25.169 --> 33:26.636
- Relaxing.

33:26.636 --> 33:27.272
Shit.

33:29.272 --> 33:30.207
- I'm a nurse Lena,

33:30.207 --> 33:31.141
and I can tell you right now

33:31.141 --> 33:32.542
that shit's not good for you.

33:32.542 --> 33:33.777
- Well I'm a user, Sharon,

33:33.777 --> 33:35.517
and I can tell you that it is.

33:40.517 --> 33:41.422
- Where are we going?

34:21.525 --> 34:22.460
- I'll stay here.

34:23.460 --> 34:24.376
- Okay.

34:40.376 --> 34:42.315
Hey, Woody around?

34:46.315 --> 34:47.885
- Who the fuck are you?

34:47.885 --> 34:50.420
- Lena, Peanut.

34:50.420 --> 34:52.657
I used to run with
Woody back in the day.

34:53.657 --> 34:55.925
- So wait, you one
of his ex-bitches?

34:55.925 --> 34:56.661
- No.

34:58.661 --> 35:02.704
- Yeah, you got that snitch
jacket on you, bitch.

35:07.704 --> 35:10.740
So wait, think you
can come around here,

35:10.740 --> 35:13.242
asking motherfuckers
where they at?

35:13.242 --> 35:16.280
You know, snitches get stitches.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.916
Or did your ass forget that?

35:18.916 --> 35:21.617
Man, step the fuck off.

35:21.617 --> 35:22.422
- Oh la.

35:26.422 --> 35:27.697
Who wants the Wood?

35:34.697 --> 35:35.405
I got this.

35:41.405 --> 35:42.672
How you doing Peanut?

35:42.672 --> 35:44.507
Long time.

35:44.507 --> 35:46.710
Or should I call you Lena, now?

35:46.710 --> 35:48.713
Since you went all
straight on me, and shit.

35:50.713 --> 35:52.516
You never said goodbye.

35:52.516 --> 35:55.253
- I know, but that
wasn't about you.

35:56.253 --> 35:57.420
I had issues.

35:57.420 --> 35:58.789
- Fuck, I had issues.

35:58.789 --> 36:00.389
So you go and take up
with the motherfucker

36:00.389 --> 36:03.393
that put you out on the
track selling your ass?

36:03.393 --> 36:05.797
Anyway, I already got
paperwork on your ass.

36:06.797 --> 36:08.798
Baby girl, this
whole conversation

36:08.798 --> 36:10.733
could be going through
the wires right now.

36:10.733 --> 36:12.436
- Ain't no paperwork
on me, Woody.

36:12.436 --> 36:13.670
And I ain't wearing a wire.

36:13.670 --> 36:14.409
- How I know that?

36:20.409 --> 36:21.514
- What that mean?

36:25.514 --> 36:26.916
- Yeah.

36:26.916 --> 36:28.822
- Take that shit off, girl.

36:32.822 --> 36:35.458
- Hold it, what the
fuck's so funny?

36:35.458 --> 36:37.561
What you all looking at?

36:38.561 --> 36:39.364
You proved your point.

36:41.364 --> 36:42.798
What you want?

36:42.798 --> 36:44.867
- There's a girl,
she's been snatched.

36:44.867 --> 36:45.404
She's only 15,

36:47.404 --> 36:48.605
but she's special to me.

36:48.605 --> 36:49.806
- That ain't my
motherfuckin' concern,

36:49.806 --> 36:51.907
we look like we kidnap
girls around here?

36:51.907 --> 36:53.976
That's some cracker shit.

36:53.976 --> 36:55.378
- It don't feel
like that though.

36:55.378 --> 36:56.579
He used the internet,

36:56.579 --> 36:58.615
but this feels like
some street shit, Woody.

36:59.615 --> 37:01.684
- You know what they say
about streets, right?

37:01.684 --> 37:02.885
The streets is dangerous.

37:02.885 --> 37:04.989
It ain't like it
used to be, Peanut.

37:06.989 --> 37:08.992
These young boys be talkin'.

37:08.992 --> 37:10.893
Drugs you sell once.

37:10.893 --> 37:13.829
But bitches, you sell
over and over and over.

37:13.829 --> 37:14.701
- Can you help me?

37:17.701 --> 37:19.010
Woody, please?

37:27.010 --> 37:27.347
Please Woody?

37:30.347 --> 37:31.414
- All right, look,

37:31.414 --> 37:32.784
I know this gorilla pimp,

37:33.784 --> 37:35.018
he's got two young
girls in his stable.

37:36.018 --> 37:38.722
He be on that internet
bullshit you talkin' about.

37:38.722 --> 37:39.755
- Where is he?

37:39.755 --> 37:41.728
- Over there in south park.

37:45.728 --> 37:46.862
I'll tell you what.

37:46.862 --> 37:47.601
Put you number in my phone.

37:52.601 --> 37:54.404
When I text you,

37:54.404 --> 37:55.440
I'm at that address.

37:57.440 --> 37:58.541
- Thank you, Woody.

37:58.541 --> 37:59.885
- Don't thank me.

38:08.885 --> 38:09.121
Hey Lena?

38:11.121 --> 38:13.389
You be careful, all right?

38:13.389 --> 38:15.994
Them boys bad news over there.

38:17.994 --> 38:18.601
- I'm bad news, too.

- Well hello.

38:58.902 --> 39:00.436
You look nice.

39:00.436 --> 39:01.472
You going out?

39:02.472 --> 39:04.909
- No, I just like
to feel pretty.

39:05.909 --> 39:06.811
- Girl, you are pretty.

39:07.811 --> 39:09.780
You don't need any of that.

39:10.780 --> 39:11.117
For real.

39:14.117 --> 39:15.786
Let me ask you something.

39:16.786 --> 39:18.891
What do you like the
best about yourself?

39:21.891 --> 39:24.168
You know it doesn't have
to be something big.

39:32.168 --> 39:36.706
Well, I think you have
a really nice smile.

39:37.706 --> 39:38.742
You do.

39:39.742 --> 39:41.012
But, can I give
you a suggestion?

39:43.012 --> 39:45.849
That lipstick, is
a little bright.

39:45.849 --> 39:47.516
- What?

39:47.516 --> 39:48.657
- Here, blot.

39:53.657 --> 39:55.760
Okay, just one more.

39:56.760 --> 39:58.867
Trust me on this.

40:03.867 --> 40:05.034
That shadow, too.

40:05.034 --> 40:08.775
Just gonna tone it down just
a little bit, just a tad.

40:11.775 --> 40:12.047
There you go.

40:18.047 --> 40:18.516
There you go.

40:20.516 --> 40:21.985
Beautiful.

40:45.074 --> 40:46.777
Oh wow.

40:47.777 --> 40:51.650
Girl, you have the most
beautiful, natural hair.

40:53.650 --> 40:54.788
Sure.

40:58.788 --> 40:59.994
Look, that's beautiful.

41:03.994 --> 41:06.931
You have a lot of
natural beauty, Violet.

41:07.931 --> 41:09.164
You don't want to cover that up,

41:09.164 --> 41:10.237
you want to enhance it.

41:19.775 --> 41:21.210
Hello?

41:21.210 --> 41:22.246

I need you to check the 'net,

41:24.648 --> 41:26.750
and see if you can
find anything on Dani.

41:26.750 --> 41:29.088
Check the dark net, I'll
send you a recent pic.

41:32.088 --> 41:34.199
- Okay, yeah, I'm on it.

41:43.199 --> 41:45.753
- You hos sleep in here.

42:03.753 --> 42:04.159

42:10.159 --> 42:12.132
Look, I'm not gonna hurt you.

42:17.132 --> 42:17.603

What's your name?

42:22.172 --> 42:23.940

42:24.940 --> 42:25.742

42:26.742 --> 42:29.144

him if I don't listen.

42:29.144 --> 42:30.014
- Who?

42:31.014 --> 42:32.286
- My brother.

42:36.286 --> 42:37.257
His name is Matt.

42:42.257 --> 42:43.097
- Listen, Miranda,

42:47.097 --> 42:49.898

Okay, and you,

42:52.936 --> 42:55.038

to see Matt again

42:55.038 --> 42:58.108

get to see my Mom again.

42:58.108 --> 42:58.144
Look at me.

43:02.144 --> 43:03.780
We're gonna get out of here.

43:04.780 --> 43:06.152
Okay, I'm gonna need your help.

43:09.152 --> 43:10.123
- Where are we?

43:13.123 --> 43:14.990

43:14.990 --> 43:15.193
- What city?

43:17.193 --> 43:19.396
- We're in Los Angeles.

43:22.998 --> 43:24.306
I just woke up here.

43:30.306 --> 43:31.074
- Hey sunshine.

43:32.074 --> 43:34.746
So I heard my ballerina
had a good shoot.

43:36.746 --> 43:38.717
Get this ho ready to
bring me some money.

43:40.717 --> 43:41.851
- Let's go.

43:42.851 --> 43:44.353
Time to rotate inventory.

43:44.353 --> 43:45.188
- No.

43:45.188 --> 43:47.056
- You gonna pay.

43:48.257 --> 43:50.893
- Okay, okay.

43:50.893 --> 43:52.228
- What?

43:52.228 --> 43:54.117
Don't you worry, you're
time's coming real quick.

44:17.753 --> 44:19.088
- What is it?

44:19.088 --> 44:21.291
- It's a text from
Woody, it's an address.

44:21.291 --> 44:22.925
Is this where we're
gonna find Dani?

44:22.925 --> 44:23.246
- I hope so.

46:29.284 --> 46:32.344
- Get your fuckin' ass in there.

46:55.344 --> 46:56.286
- Lena wait up.

47:06.356 --> 47:08.423
- Get up, bitch.

47:08.423 --> 47:10.559
I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

47:10.559 --> 47:12.529
Shut the fuck up.

47:16.365 --> 47:17.333

Thank you.

47:53.969 --> 47:55.371

47:56.371 --> 47:59.309
- I'm sorry, just rolled

47:59.309 --> 48:01.476
you had some young females.

48:01.476 --> 48:02.112
I'm looking to buy.

48:04.112 --> 48:05.514
- Y'all bitches ain't got no
email or nothin' like that?

48:05.514 --> 48:07.115
Fuck.

48:07.115 --> 48:08.353
- Is it a problem, nigger?

48:11.353 --> 48:12.722
- Look, I got some bad
bitches up in here,

48:12.722 --> 48:15.291
but they ain't gonna be cheap.

48:15.291 --> 48:16.125
- That's cool.

48:16.125 --> 48:17.159
Let me see 'em.

48:17.159 --> 48:19.362
- Wow, this motherfuckin'
walk up to the door.

48:19.362 --> 48:20.596
All right, whatever,
it's gonna cost you

48:20.596 --> 48:22.431
40 bucks just to see 'em.

48:22.431 --> 48:23.565
- Nigger I ain't gonna
pay you for no bitch

48:23.565 --> 48:24.335
I can't inspect first.

48:26.335 --> 48:27.472
- You buyin' a bitch or what?

48:30.472 --> 48:31.041
- All right, here, cool.

48:33.041 --> 48:34.409
- Shit.

48:34.409 --> 48:35.545
Better not be that fake shit.

48:35.545 --> 48:37.724
Okay okay, hey bitch, get
here, come get this money.

48:47.724 --> 48:49.157
- Hey man, what
the fuck is this?

48:49.157 --> 48:51.460
I heard you had young
females up in here.

48:51.460 --> 48:52.396
- Oh, they young.

48:52.396 --> 48:54.664
See I stay away from
all that freak shit.

48:54.664 --> 48:56.498
- But you know about it, right?

48:56.498 --> 48:57.168
You do your biz online.

48:59.168 --> 49:00.570
- The fuck you know
about my business?

49:00.570 --> 49:02.538
Yeah, I got this new
app, what about it?

49:02.538 --> 49:04.507
- So you know somebody
who recruits and sells

49:04.507 --> 49:06.141
young girls online or not?

49:06.141 --> 49:08.577
- Kidnaps young girls online.

49:08.577 --> 49:10.579
- Fuck, is you all the police?

49:10.579 --> 49:11.550
- I'm a mother.

49:14.550 --> 49:16.518
- I got a mom, I
feel you, I feel you.

49:16.518 --> 49:18.086
Hey hey hey bitch,
remember that motherfucker

49:18.086 --> 49:20.356
that was all fuckin'
about money and shit?

49:20.356 --> 49:22.726
Didn't want to fuck
that nigger up.

49:23.726 --> 49:25.494
Yeah, I know that
bitch-ass nigger Qwan,

49:25.494 --> 49:26.762
fuck that nigger.

49:26.762 --> 49:27.764
- Qwan?

49:28.764 --> 49:30.436
- That's all the
fuck I can tell you.

49:34.436 --> 49:35.538
- That's cool.

49:35.538 --> 49:36.478
Thanks man.

49:43.478 --> 49:44.416
- Bitch, count that money.

50:22.784 --> 50:24.487
- What's up, Derrick?

50:24.487 --> 50:26.822
What's up with this
nigger named Qwan?

50:26.822 --> 50:28.391
I heard the girls
around this area,

50:28.391 --> 50:29.625
he's got some young girls,

50:29.625 --> 50:31.327
you know anything about that?

50:31.327 --> 50:33.295
- No, I don't.

50:33.295 --> 50:34.630
- You know anybody who does?

50:34.630 --> 50:36.132
- No, baby girl, I don't.

50:36.132 --> 50:37.603
- All right, thanks.

50:40.603 --> 50:41.603
- Hey girl, how you doing?

50:41.603 --> 50:44.340
- I'm good, I'm looking
for a nigger named Qwan.

50:44.340 --> 50:45.307
You know anything about that?

50:45.307 --> 50:46.242
- Qwan?
- Yeah.

50:46.242 --> 50:47.844
- Around here?
- Yeah.

50:47.844 --> 50:48.581
- Got a cigarette?

50:51.581 --> 50:52.784
- Here.

50:54.784 --> 50:58.353
My boy says Qwan stays
somewhere around here.

50:58.353 --> 51:00.456
There's a particular
ho I'm looking for.

51:00.456 --> 51:01.391
He said Qwan might
know where she is.

51:01.391 --> 51:04.293
So you don't know
nobody who knows Qwan?

51:04.293 --> 51:07.530
Anything like that, anything
that could get me to help?

51:07.530 --> 51:10.682
- I don't know no
nigger named Qwan.

51:27.682 --> 51:28.918
- I figure we can find out

51:28.918 --> 51:31.722
who some of Qwan's
girls are over here.

51:32.722 --> 51:34.657
12 to two, those
are the hot hours.

51:35.657 --> 51:37.559
- Hot hours?

51:37.559 --> 51:39.327
- It's when the
businessmen go to lunch,

51:39.327 --> 51:41.664
and they ain't just
trollin' for fast food.

51:42.664 --> 51:44.317
That's one of them over there.

52:01.317 --> 52:03.654
- She doesn't
look like one of them.

52:04.654 --> 52:06.755
- What does one
of them look like?

52:06.755 --> 52:08.657
I mean obviously
they'd look like me.

52:08.657 --> 52:10.228
But they can also
be cute and blonde.

52:12.228 --> 52:13.831
- What is this about, Lena?

52:16.831 --> 52:18.201
You showed up to my daughter's

52:18.201 --> 52:20.268
ninth birthday
party high as hell,

52:20.268 --> 52:22.405
and I didn't know how to
deal with your shit anymore.

52:22.405 --> 52:24.206
I'd been taking care of
you since high school,

52:24.206 --> 52:26.474
you running off for days,
high, out of your mind,

52:26.474 --> 52:27.677
and you wanted me to do

52:27.677 --> 52:28.744
the same thing while
raising a child?

52:28.744 --> 52:30.846
- No, I wanted you to
not turn your back on me.

52:30.846 --> 52:33.516
- Oh, don't act like you
were a fucking angel, Lena.

52:33.516 --> 52:34.916
You were in the goddamn streets.

52:34.916 --> 52:36.952
- And you're so perfect, right?

52:36.952 --> 52:39.588
You got all these
extracurricular activities,

52:39.588 --> 52:41.724
and all these fancy-ass
clubs and instructors

52:41.724 --> 52:44.927
who are spending more time
with Dani, than you are.

52:44.927 --> 52:45.463
- Fuck you, Lena.

52:48.463 --> 52:49.800
- That's right, Sharon.

52:50.800 --> 52:51.750
Fuck me.

53:07.750 --> 53:09.753
- Your man Ronnie, right?

53:10.753 --> 53:11.889
- Yeah.

53:13.889 --> 53:15.826
- Heard he got
a new moneymaker.

53:16.826 --> 53:17.827
- So?

53:18.827 --> 53:19.829
- Just saying.

53:20.829 --> 53:22.764
Heard she might
be pregnant, too.

53:55.764 --> 53:56.998
- Where are you going?

53:56.998 --> 53:59.637
- I'm not about this
square-ass life.

54:01.637 --> 54:04.677
- Hey, you know there's
nothing out there for you.

54:07.677 --> 54:08.413
- I miss him.

54:10.413 --> 54:11.481
- You didn't give it a chance.

54:13.481 --> 54:14.900
Please, don't go.

55:04.900 --> 55:06.637
- Oh shit.

55:09.637 --> 55:10.079
- What is it, Lena?

55:17.079 --> 55:18.681
Tell me, what is it?

55:18.681 --> 55:19.784
Tell me.

55:22.784 --> 55:24.554
Oh, oh my God.

55:26.889 --> 55:28.974
- We're gonna find her.

55:44.974 --> 55:46.144
- She's top of the line, ho.

55:49.144 --> 55:49.614
Yeah.

55:52.614 --> 55:53.154
Never been touched.

55:58.154 --> 55:58.456
Okay.

56:01.456 --> 56:02.197
Cool.

56:08.197 --> 56:09.833
We good.

56:10.833 --> 56:12.809
Now we just gotta
turn this bitch out.

56:19.809 --> 56:21.945
- You know what hurt
my feelings, Sunshine?

56:23.945 --> 56:25.117
You trying to run away from me.

56:28.117 --> 56:29.985
I thought you were mine.

56:29.985 --> 56:31.755
- Fuck you.

56:32.755 --> 56:33.856
- Fuck me?

56:33.856 --> 56:35.458
Fuck you.

56:35.458 --> 56:36.192
Fuck you, your fucking mother

56:36.192 --> 56:37.862
don't give a shit about you.

56:39.862 --> 56:41.664
She's never gonna find you.

56:42.664 --> 56:45.634
Her working all the time.

56:45.634 --> 56:46.704
She doesn't know how you feel,

56:48.704 --> 56:50.074
how you felt after
your daddy died.

56:52.074 --> 56:53.476
You know who does?

56:54.476 --> 56:55.110
Justin.

56:56.110 --> 56:58.583
Justin knows everything.

57:00.583 --> 57:04.686
And sooner or later,
you're gonna realize

57:04.686 --> 57:08.235
that I'm the only one
who truly loves you.

57:19.235 --> 57:20.969
- It's gonna be okay.

57:20.969 --> 57:22.237
Listen to me.

57:22.237 --> 57:24.072
I've been on this track before.

57:24.072 --> 57:26.509
These pictures don't
mean it's too late.

57:26.509 --> 57:28.010
We can actually
use them as clues.

57:29.010 --> 57:29.010
Right?

57:29.844 --> 57:31.715
Look, this is all code.

57:32.715 --> 57:33.849
They say she's 18,

57:33.849 --> 57:35.050
but you can tell how old

57:35.050 --> 57:36.822
she really is by
counting the hearts.

57:39.822 --> 57:40.659
I know who's got her.

57:44.659 --> 57:45.027
Eve.

57:46.027 --> 57:48.164
We had the same pimp
back in the day.

57:49.164 --> 57:51.300
- So you could just
talk to her, right?

57:51.300 --> 57:53.168
- It's not like we're
on the best of terms.

57:53.168 --> 57:54.807
I was Killer P's bottom bitch.

57:59.807 --> 58:00.010
That made Eve crazy.

58:01.010 --> 58:03.244
- You you know where they are.

58:03.244 --> 58:04.947
You know where to
find them, right?

58:04.947 --> 58:06.315
- Look, believe it or not,
there are rules to this,

58:06.315 --> 58:08.784
and Eve doesn't exactly
play by those rules.

58:08.784 --> 58:11.719
- No no no, look there
has to be something.

58:11.719 --> 58:12.554
There has to be something.

58:12.554 --> 58:13.322
You know the codes.

58:13.322 --> 58:15.123
You know how this works.

58:15.123 --> 58:15.760
I know it's sick but,

58:17.760 --> 58:19.028
can't we just set
it up to buy her.

58:20.028 --> 58:21.329
I just want my daughter back.

58:21.329 --> 58:22.731
- No.

58:22.731 --> 58:23.971
It's too dangerous.

58:28.971 --> 58:30.838
Okay look, there
might be a better way.

58:30.838 --> 58:32.273
It's a long shot but
I'm still in contact

58:32.273 --> 58:33.311
with her girl, Marcie.

58:36.311 --> 58:38.213
- Marcie might
know where she is?

58:39.213 --> 58:40.371
- I hope so.

59:03.371 --> 59:05.206
- Lena, leave before
I call the cops.

59:05.206 --> 59:06.775
- I just want some
information, Cesar.

59:06.775 --> 59:07.710
- You crazy, bitch.

59:07.710 --> 59:09.112
- It's not gonna take long.

59:10.112 --> 59:10.112
- Get out.

59:10.980 --> 59:13.047
- I just want to
know where Marcie is.

59:13.047 --> 59:13.329
- Fuck you.

59:27.329 --> 59:29.797
- Actually looks
like you fucked her.

59:29.797 --> 59:30.000
Why don't you tell
me where Marcie is,

59:31.000 --> 59:32.201
and that way I don't
have to call the police

59:32.201 --> 59:33.936
and tell 'em you're
paying for pussy?

59:33.936 --> 59:35.269
- Excuse me?

59:35.269 --> 59:36.704
Get the fuck out of here.

59:36.704 --> 59:37.641
- Okay.

59:38.641 --> 59:40.242
But first why
don't I call Nancy.

59:40.242 --> 59:42.043
She should like to know
what kind of freaky shit

59:42.043 --> 59:43.646
her husband is involved in.

59:44.646 --> 59:46.047
- How much you want to
keep your trap closed?

59:46.047 --> 59:48.050
- I don't want money.

59:48.050 --> 59:49.085
- Well that's a first.

59:51.085 --> 59:51.322
- Where's Marcie?

59:53.322 --> 59:55.057
- Haven't seen her in months.

59:56.057 --> 59:57.092
Why?

59:57.092 --> 59:58.404
- That's my business.

01:00:08.404 --> 01:00:11.210
- Studio City, I can't
afford her ass anymore.

01:00:26.889 --> 01:00:29.199
- Are you sure this
is the right place?

01:00:48.143 --> 01:00:49.012
- Can I help you?

01:00:50.012 --> 01:00:50.914
- Marcie called me.

01:00:51.914 --> 01:00:53.181
- Really?

01:00:53.181 --> 01:00:54.849
- It's about a panic
attack coming on,

01:00:54.849 --> 01:00:56.918
and she forgot her meds, so
she called me to bring 'em.

01:00:56.918 --> 01:01:00.088
- I suggest you get out of here.

01:01:00.088 --> 01:01:02.490
- Look, she really needs
these meds that I've got.

01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:03.925
- Now.

01:01:03.925 --> 01:01:04.235
Go.

01:01:13.235 --> 01:01:16.038
Hey, putsch,

01:01:16.038 --> 01:01:17.405
she can bring.

01:01:17.405 --> 01:01:19.143
You, I watch you.

01:01:21.143 --> 01:01:21.282
Come.

01:02:03.351 --> 01:02:05.391
- Hey quit playing.

01:02:09.391 --> 01:02:11.793
- Come into home.

01:02:34.449 --> 01:02:35.530
Go to the left.

01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:50.365
You are best friend?

01:02:51.365 --> 01:02:52.052
- No.

01:03:10.052 --> 01:03:11.152
Marcie?

01:03:11.152 --> 01:03:13.054
Can you hear me?

01:03:13.054 --> 01:03:15.190
Wake up, where's Eve?

01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:18.961
Eve, sit up honey,
I need your help.

01:03:19.961 --> 01:03:20.565
Where's Eve?

01:03:23.565 --> 01:03:24.398
Eve.

01:03:24.398 --> 01:03:26.300
- Fuck Eve.

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:27.103
That bitch threw me away.

01:03:29.103 --> 01:03:31.373
She said I was too
old to make her money.

01:03:32.373 --> 01:03:33.275
Do I look fuckin' old?

01:03:33.275 --> 01:03:34.610
- No, no you don't.

01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:36.277
Just tell us where she is.

01:03:36.277 --> 01:03:37.382
- She had a new bitch.

01:03:40.382 --> 01:03:42.217
- I knew I don't trust you.

01:03:42.217 --> 01:03:44.585
- No no no, we just need a
little information, please.

01:03:44.585 --> 01:03:45.420
That's all.

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:47.155
- You, I think I trust.

01:03:47.155 --> 01:03:48.657
But you?

01:03:48.657 --> 01:03:50.893
I don't like you.

01:03:51.893 --> 01:03:54.195
Get the fuck out.

01:03:54.195 --> 01:03:55.297
- Okay, we're gonna go.

01:03:55.297 --> 01:03:57.431
- No no no, she stay.

01:03:57.431 --> 01:03:58.001
She stays here.

01:03:59.001 --> 01:03:59.001
- You know what?

01:03:59.934 --> 01:04:01.469
You don't want her with you.

01:04:01.469 --> 01:04:03.371
She doesn't have any skills.

01:04:03.371 --> 01:04:04.639
I'm good.

01:04:04.639 --> 01:04:06.909
- You try to fuck me,
you fuck my business.

01:04:06.909 --> 01:04:09.311
- I'm the one with the
skills, leave her out of it.

01:04:09.311 --> 01:04:10.583
- I don't want you, nigitch.

01:04:18.686 --> 01:04:19.023
- Down, down.

01:04:22.023 --> 01:04:23.492
Down.

01:04:23.492 --> 01:04:24.021
Down.

01:05:01.730 --> 01:05:03.376
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

01:05:14.376 --> 01:05:19.416
- That bitch gets her
drugs from cardiac doc,

01:05:21.416 --> 01:05:22.552
the Richmond location.

01:05:24.552 --> 01:05:27.094
Tell her Marcie said, ha.

01:05:32.094 --> 01:05:32.563
- Richmond.

01:05:34.563 --> 01:05:36.009
I think I know where that is.

01:05:47.009 --> 01:05:49.079
- Sunshine, you're special.

01:05:51.079 --> 01:05:52.414
I haven't had

01:05:52.414 --> 01:05:54.251
an offer like that in years.

01:05:56.251 --> 01:05:58.387
Sunshine here, she's
gonna be a big moneymaker,

01:05:58.387 --> 01:05:59.326
you mark my words.

01:06:07.429 --> 01:06:08.532
Yeah.

01:06:11.532 --> 01:06:14.574
Hey Jas, the pickup's ready.

01:06:20.574 --> 01:06:22.045
Give me attitude, honey.

01:06:24.045 --> 01:06:24.152
Bottom bitch.

01:06:30.152 --> 01:06:31.454
Hey, come on.

01:06:32.454 --> 01:06:35.190
Give me your hands, it's
time to give thanks.

01:06:35.190 --> 01:06:37.559
Come on Sunshine, hold my hand.

01:06:37.559 --> 01:06:38.762
We're gonna get you on.

01:06:40.762 --> 01:06:42.697
God, we thank you so much,

01:06:42.697 --> 01:06:45.534
for bringing our family
together over this table.

01:06:46.534 --> 01:06:49.603
For Sunshine, thank
you this blessing Lord.

01:06:49.603 --> 01:06:51.739
You keep her safe and
you keep her strong,

01:06:51.739 --> 01:06:55.409
and may your angels carry
her every step of the way.

01:06:55.409 --> 01:07:00.081
You bless her, and you give
her your almighty protection.

01:07:00.081 --> 01:07:02.454
May that money flow to this
house whole, with gold,

01:07:05.454 --> 01:07:07.755
with so much blessing
that will overflow

01:07:07.755 --> 01:07:10.092
these doors and these windows.

01:07:10.092 --> 01:07:11.860
Lord keep these sisters united,

01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:14.663
and keep them strong.

01:07:14.663 --> 01:07:15.505
Thank you, Lord.

01:07:41.655 --> 01:07:43.260
- Damn, I missed you baby.

01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:47.603
- I missed you too.
- So sexy.

01:07:54.603 --> 01:07:56.708
I got you something.

01:08:00.708 --> 01:08:02.719
I'm gonna go get it.

01:08:11.719 --> 01:08:12.255
Happy early birthday.

01:08:14.255 --> 01:08:15.759
- For me?

01:08:17.759 --> 01:08:21.563
- And I also got you a
recording session, I set one up.

01:08:21.563 --> 01:08:23.430
I got a music
producer coming in.

01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:27.435
He's gonna sit in and listen
to that beautiful voice.

01:08:27.435 --> 01:08:28.670
- Really?

01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:30.640
- Right, what did I tell you?

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:33.408
- Thank you.

01:08:33.408 --> 01:08:34.377
Thank you.

01:08:36.377 --> 01:08:38.755
- All right, I want to see
how tight it is on you.

01:08:46.755 --> 01:08:47.658
- Beautiful.

01:08:49.658 --> 01:08:50.769
- Try it on.

01:09:00.769 --> 01:09:03.372
- It's pretty but,
it's kind of short.

01:09:05.372 --> 01:09:06.841
- It's a work dress.

01:09:06.841 --> 01:09:08.243
- Work?

01:09:08.243 --> 01:09:11.444
- Recording studios
cost money baby.

01:09:11.444 --> 01:09:12.381
Dreams don't come cheap.

01:09:15.381 --> 01:09:16.689
- I thought it could
be different this time.

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:21.925
- You know, we're in love.

01:09:23.925 --> 01:09:25.439
But we all gotta work.

01:09:38.439 --> 01:09:39.876
Whoa, whoa whoa.

01:09:41.876 --> 01:09:42.823
Get up.

01:09:54.823 --> 01:09:57.746
You're not gonna need these.

01:10:26.421 --> 01:10:27.055
- You can't get in here.

01:10:27.055 --> 01:10:27.055
- Where's Eve?

01:10:27.988 --> 01:10:28.823
- Who?

01:10:28.823 --> 01:10:29.757
- Eve.

01:10:29.757 --> 01:10:30.693
- I don't know who that is.

01:10:31.693 --> 01:10:32.662
- Okay.

01:10:34.662 --> 01:10:35.863
How about now?

01:10:35.863 --> 01:10:36.831
'Cause a little birdie told me

01:10:36.831 --> 01:10:38.632
that she likes to buy drugs,

01:10:38.632 --> 01:10:40.368
and you like to sell 'em to her.

01:10:40.368 --> 01:10:43.537
- I know who she is, but
I don't know where she is.

01:10:43.537 --> 01:10:45.542
- Okay, let's try
this a different way.

01:10:47.542 --> 01:10:49.944
- Now, once I insert this needle
into your external jugular,

01:10:49.944 --> 01:10:52.346
this succinylcholine is
gonna stop your heart,

01:10:52.346 --> 01:10:55.716
but slowly, because
for seven long minutes

01:10:55.716 --> 01:10:57.819
you're gonna enjoy the tight
unbearable constriction

01:10:57.819 --> 01:10:59.087
of your failing heart.

01:10:59.087 --> 01:11:00.788
Now you have three options.

01:11:00.788 --> 01:11:02.990
She can cut you, and
you'll bleed out.

01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:04.859
I can stick this
needle in your neck,

01:11:04.859 --> 01:11:06.461
and in seven minutes
you'll be dead,

01:11:06.461 --> 01:11:08.029
or you can tell us
where the fuck Eve is.

01:11:09.029 --> 01:11:10.800
You got anything to say.

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:14.469
- I'll tell you everything.

01:11:14.469 --> 01:11:15.751
She's on the way.

01:11:29.751 --> 01:11:31.921
- Remember when
I got my license?

01:11:33.921 --> 01:11:37.725
Drove us up to Mulholland
in that shitty old car,

01:11:37.725 --> 01:11:38.563
watched the sunset.

01:11:41.563 --> 01:11:42.797
That was nice.

01:11:43.797 --> 01:11:45.469
- Yeah, and then
your car broke down.

01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:49.939
My dad was so mad at us.

01:11:50.939 --> 01:11:53.140
He was like, if I wanted
you to go joyriding

01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:54.514
I would have left
you with your mom.

01:11:59.514 --> 01:12:01.417
- You know your father still
lives in the neighborhood?

01:12:03.417 --> 01:12:04.923
- I heard.

01:12:09.923 --> 01:12:11.927
- You were right about Dani.

01:12:13.927 --> 01:12:15.530
I should spend
more time with her.

01:12:16.530 --> 01:12:17.966
- Don't do that.

01:12:17.966 --> 01:12:19.069
Don't beat yourself up,
it's not gonna help.

01:12:21.069 --> 01:12:22.972
You did the best you could.

01:12:24.972 --> 01:12:26.542
Better than my mom and dad.

01:12:27.542 --> 01:12:28.083
Probably better than yours, too.

01:12:36.083 --> 01:12:37.819
Saint Maria Goretti.

01:12:38.819 --> 01:12:41.994
Forgiveness, that's why
she's there, to remind me.

01:12:46.994 --> 01:12:48.731
- Sister Mary always said,

01:12:50.731 --> 01:12:53.768
when you forgive, you in
no way change the past,

01:12:53.768 --> 01:12:56.939
but you sure do
change what's to come.

01:12:58.939 --> 01:13:00.975
That was one mean old lady.

01:13:01.975 --> 01:13:03.952
- Yeah, but she knew what
she was talking about.

01:13:10.952 --> 01:13:12.820
- You know what I want, Runway?

01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:16.131
I want you to make
my Sunshine pretty.

01:13:23.131 --> 01:13:24.905
- Let's go.

01:13:31.905 --> 01:13:34.118
- Where the fuck is that bitch?

01:13:44.118 --> 01:13:45.021
- That's gotta be her.

01:14:45.046 --> 01:14:48.059
That must be the
house, right there.

01:14:58.059 --> 01:14:59.301
Sharon.

01:15:06.301 --> 01:15:07.234
- Where's my daughter?

01:15:07.234 --> 01:15:09.805
- Bitch, who the fuck are you?

01:15:10.805 --> 01:15:12.140
Gonna fuck you up, bitch.

01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:12.006
- And I'm gonna
fuck you up, bitch.

01:15:13.006 --> 01:15:13.213
Get off of her.

01:15:20.213 --> 01:15:21.684
Go.

01:15:22.684 --> 01:15:23.752
- Lena.

01:15:24.752 --> 01:15:25.987
- Dani?

01:15:25.987 --> 01:15:26.921
- Aren't you that
bitch in the streets

01:15:26.921 --> 01:15:28.122
playing captain save-a-ho?

01:15:28.122 --> 01:15:29.122
- Shut up.

01:15:29.122 --> 01:15:30.057
- What you come back for?

01:15:30.057 --> 01:15:31.292
You wanna suck some dick, bitch?

01:15:31.292 --> 01:15:32.627
- Shut up!

01:15:33.627 --> 01:15:35.662
- Nobody's here.

01:15:35.662 --> 01:15:36.099
- Where's Dani?

01:15:38.099 --> 01:15:39.168
- The new bitch?

01:15:41.168 --> 01:15:43.005
She's getting turned
the fuck out, right now.

01:15:44.005 --> 01:15:47.310
Eve got her ass at your old
stomping grounds off Ventura.

01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:51.721
Yeah, bitch.

01:16:00.721 --> 01:16:01.256
- Lena?

01:16:02.256 --> 01:16:04.257
Lena come on, we got it.

01:16:04.257 --> 01:16:05.269
Let's go.

01:16:15.269 --> 01:16:16.143
- The fuck you waiting on?

01:16:22.143 --> 01:16:23.146
Not that one,

01:16:26.146 --> 01:16:27.247
that one.

01:16:27.247 --> 01:16:28.752
Yeah.

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:31.658
That's the one.

01:16:36.658 --> 01:16:38.029
First time is
always the hardest.

01:16:42.029 --> 01:16:43.800
It's game time, let's go.

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:46.144
Now!

01:17:44.859 --> 01:17:46.328
- You look nice.

01:17:48.328 --> 01:17:49.832
Sweet.

01:18:25.832 --> 01:18:27.835
- Lena, we gotta go.

01:18:27.835 --> 01:18:29.472
We really gotta go.

01:18:32.472 --> 01:18:34.242
So what happens now?

01:18:34.242 --> 01:18:35.842
- Look, it's gonna be
easier if I go by myself,

01:18:35.842 --> 01:18:37.043
so you just stay here,

01:18:37.043 --> 01:18:38.346
and I'm gonna go
find the room, okay?

01:18:39.346 --> 01:18:40.215
- We came all this way,

01:18:40.215 --> 01:18:41.515
and you expect me
to just wait here?

01:18:41.515 --> 01:18:43.787
- Just trust me, please.

01:18:46.787 --> 01:18:48.826
- Come back with my girl.

01:19:04.838 --> 01:19:09.978
- Room service.

01:19:10.978 --> 01:19:15.360
- Room service.

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:28.266
- Room service.

01:19:33.266 --> 01:19:34.113
- Room service.

01:19:47.113 --> 01:19:48.523
- Got the money?

01:19:55.523 --> 01:19:57.457
What the fuck is that, bitch?

01:19:57.457 --> 01:19:59.460
Where's my stuff?

01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:01.512
You don't hold out
your dumb bitch.

01:20:19.512 --> 01:20:21.983
- Now what's the matter,
pretty cheerleader?

01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:22.351
Huh?

01:20:24.351 --> 01:20:25.554
So soft.

01:20:27.421 --> 01:20:28.456
- Room service.

01:20:28.456 --> 01:20:29.458
- Do not disturb.

01:20:32.493 --> 01:20:33.594
- Room service.

01:20:33.594 --> 01:20:35.429
- Jesus.

01:20:36.930 --> 01:20:38.431
- Room service.

01:20:38.431 --> 01:20:40.533
- I said no room service.

01:20:40.533 --> 01:20:41.202
Okay.

01:20:41.202 --> 01:20:42.536
- Get the fuck out of here.

01:20:42.536 --> 01:20:43.305
- I'm going.

01:20:45.305 --> 01:20:46.439
- Dani?

01:20:46.439 --> 01:20:48.442
Hey, it's me.

01:20:48.442 --> 01:20:50.144
It's Lena, I'm here to help you.

01:20:50.144 --> 01:20:51.412
I'm gonna take you home.

01:20:51.412 --> 01:20:54.414
- No, no, God what
did you just do?

01:20:54.414 --> 01:20:56.149
Now she's gonna hurt
me, she's gonna find me,

01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:57.350
and she's gonna hurt me.

01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:59.453
- No, nobody's gonna find
you, no one is gonna hurt you,

01:20:59.453 --> 01:21:00.654
I promise.

01:21:00.654 --> 01:21:02.024
Nobody is gonna hurt you, okay?

01:21:03.024 --> 01:21:04.358
You just come with me,

01:21:04.358 --> 01:21:05.592
and everything is
gonna be all right.

01:21:05.592 --> 01:21:08.229
No one is gonna hurt
you, I promise, Sweetie.

01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:09.264
- She's right, baby.

01:21:10.264 --> 01:21:11.467
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:21:14.467 --> 01:21:16.369
How ya doing wifie?

01:21:16.369 --> 01:21:17.971
Coming back home?

01:21:17.971 --> 01:21:19.006
- You let her go, Eve.

01:21:20.006 --> 01:21:21.442
- Looks like she
doesn't want to.

01:21:21.442 --> 01:21:23.077
- You know good and goddamn well

01:21:23.077 --> 01:21:25.345
this girl does not want
to be here with you.

01:21:25.345 --> 01:21:27.213
She is a child.

01:21:27.213 --> 01:21:31.284
You let her go, and give her
a chance at a normal life.

01:21:31.284 --> 01:21:32.621
- A normal life?

01:21:33.621 --> 01:21:35.657
How about the life
you had with me?

01:21:36.657 --> 01:21:38.162
Where I made you feel real good.

01:21:41.162 --> 01:21:43.096
The game is the game,

01:21:43.096 --> 01:21:44.667
and always will be.

01:21:47.667 --> 01:21:50.204
And why the fuck am I gonna
give her another chance?

01:21:51.204 --> 01:21:52.472
They never gave me one.

01:21:52.472 --> 01:21:53.542
- Dani, let's go.

01:21:55.542 --> 01:21:56.002
- Sunshine.

01:22:22.002 --> 01:22:23.271
- Dani, let's go.

01:22:25.271 --> 01:22:26.743
- Sunshine.

01:22:29.743 --> 01:22:30.581
Sunshine.

01:22:33.581 --> 01:22:38.586
- Dani.

01:22:38.586 --> 01:22:39.552
Dani!

01:22:39.552 --> 01:22:41.454
Dani.

01:22:41.454 --> 01:22:43.527
- Looks like the ho chose.

01:22:46.527 --> 01:22:48.163
- Dani?

01:22:50.163 --> 01:22:51.465
- Sunshine!

01:22:51.465 --> 01:22:52.432
Sunshine.

01:22:52.432 --> 01:22:55.269
Oh hell no, this bitch is mine.

01:22:55.269 --> 01:22:56.503
What the fuck?

01:22:56.503 --> 01:22:57.140
Fuck!

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:00.073
- Lena!

01:23:00.073 --> 01:23:01.509
- Go get Dani out of here.

01:23:01.509 --> 01:23:03.476
- Fuck you, bitch.

01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:51.393
- It's okay, it's okay.

01:23:52.393 --> 01:23:53.761
You're safe, you're safe.

01:23:53.761 --> 01:23:54.096
It's okay.

01:23:56.096 --> 01:23:57.530
Baby,

01:23:57.530 --> 01:23:58.801
I love you.

01:24:00.801 --> 01:24:02.837
No one's gonna ever
hurt you again.

01:24:03.837 --> 01:24:05.783
- Don't you move.

01:24:15.783 --> 01:24:18.686
- What bitch, you gonna kill me?

01:24:19.686 --> 01:24:21.896
