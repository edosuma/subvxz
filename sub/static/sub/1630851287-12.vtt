<i>Then I did my sixth double axel,</i>

00:36.262 --> 00:37.202
looked at the judges

00:37.204 --> 00:38.853
and said, "Judge this, dorks."

00:38.855 --> 00:40.021
Oh, that gives me an idea.

00:40.041 --> 00:42.266
We should put some skates
on the Dread Sled.

00:42.284 --> 00:43.450
Wait. What's the Dread Sled?

00:43.602 --> 00:45.786
I like sleds
and I love feeling dread.

00:45.880 --> 00:48.772
Well, uh, it's, uh, um...

00:48.791 --> 00:51.699
Moon, we've been building
a motorized sled together.

00:51.794 --> 00:52.885
Without me?

00:53.112 --> 00:55.445
How come you guys
never told me about this?

00:55.464 --> 00:56.463
Well, because...

00:56.557 --> 00:58.706
we do it when our moms do
Moms' Night.

00:58.801 --> 01:00.801
We're gonna ride the sled
across Fall-Thru Lake.

01:00.895 --> 01:02.469
You know that lake's cursed,
right?

01:02.621 --> 01:04.471
Yes. Someone tried to have
a quinceañera there,

01:04.565 --> 01:06.290
but it fell through
three different times

01:06.308 --> 01:08.125
due to scheduling issues,
and the next thing you know,

01:08.218 --> 01:10.385
she was turning 16
and it was too late.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.813
Taking this sled on a run is
gonna be the most fun I've had

01:12.965 --> 01:16.391
since my mom's boyfriend Jamie
took me on a wildflower hike.

01:16.485 --> 01:19.894
I almost passed out from how
beautiful the buttercups were.

01:19.914 --> 01:22.322
I'm in. For the sled,
not the buttercups.

01:22.474 --> 01:25.084
Well, Moon, like I said, we only
do sled stuff on Moms' Nights.

01:25.311 --> 01:28.420
We would have invited you,
but you don't have a mom.

01:28.572 --> 01:31.481
-What if I could find one?
-You can't just go
to the grocery store,

01:31.500 --> 01:33.817
put a hat on a pineapple,
and call it your mother.

01:33.836 --> 01:35.485
I know tons of moms.

01:35.504 --> 01:37.170
For instance, Beverly,
the elderly security guard

01:37.323 --> 01:38.338
at the Greyhound station.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.173
I'm sure she
could get the job done.

01:40.250 --> 01:41.675
I'll definitely bring a mom.

01:41.827 --> 01:43.160
I might even bring two.

01:43.253 --> 01:44.603
Now,<i> this</i> is salmon jerky.

01:44.754 --> 01:46.012
I feel very Jazzercised.

01:46.165 --> 01:48.014
I see where they get the energy
to swim upstream.

01:48.167 --> 01:50.142
Hey, is that our pot holder?
I swear I tucked it

01:50.294 --> 01:52.611
into its little drawer
in the guest cabin this morning.

01:52.838 --> 01:55.355
-I wonder how he got over here.
-Maybe he couldn't sleep,

01:55.524 --> 01:58.099
so he grew little legs
and walked over here.

01:58.193 --> 02:01.695
<i> Or</i> is there a possibility
that this pot holder's haunted?

02:01.847 --> 02:03.271
I doubt that, babe.

02:03.290 --> 02:05.773
Oh, I hope it is.
You know I love haunted stuff.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.126
Mansions, banshees,

02:07.353 --> 02:08.852
the look in Emma Thompson's eyes

02:08.945 --> 02:10.687
in the final scene
of<i> Howards End.</i>

02:10.780 --> 02:13.190
Let's take it home and put it
in its little beddy-bye.

02:13.283 --> 02:15.192
And I'll sing something
to get it back to Snoozeville.

02:15.285 --> 02:17.544
I just checked out a new ska
lullabies CD from the library.

02:17.696 --> 02:21.031
He'll be skanking to sleep
in no time.

02:21.124 --> 02:22.307
<i> MOON:</i>
<i> Dad, I was wondering</i>

02:22.459 --> 02:23.142
about something.

02:23.293 --> 02:24.459
You like moms, right?

02:24.478 --> 02:26.645
And might be interested
in meeting some?

02:26.796 --> 02:28.313
Ah, maybe.
But not many moms

02:28.465 --> 02:30.056
want to hang out
with a single dad.

02:30.151 --> 02:32.209
They assume
I'm some sort of barbarian

02:32.227 --> 02:34.969
who's gonna use their iron
to make a grilled cheese.

02:34.989 --> 02:36.971
But if there was a group of moms
who knew

02:36.991 --> 02:39.324
that you know how to use an iron
in a regular way,

02:39.476 --> 02:40.808
would you be interested
in joining them?

02:40.903 --> 02:42.810
Oof. Not really.
Groups aren't for me.

02:42.905 --> 02:44.812
Remember,
I briefly joined that book club,

02:44.907 --> 02:46.665
and it didn't go well.

02:46.892 --> 02:48.167
<i> We were reading</i>
Girl on the Train,

02:48.318 --> 02:51.244
<i> and everyone said</i>
<i>I was too focused on the train.</i>

02:51.397 --> 02:54.398
Okay, well, then,
on a completely unrelated topic,

02:54.416 --> 02:57.734
I have to do homework
at Henry's house tomorrow night.

02:57.827 --> 03:00.237
-Can you drop me off?
-You bet.

03:00.239 --> 03:01.588
Ah, night homework.

03:01.740 --> 03:04.457
I remember the thrill
of diagramming sentences

03:04.518 --> 03:05.684
in the evening.

03:05.911 --> 03:07.928
Hey, guys, you got to come
in the living room.

03:08.080 --> 03:09.596
Dad, I know you said
I'm an adult now,

03:09.748 --> 03:11.748
and you don't need to see
how high I can jump,

03:11.767 --> 03:13.174
but I'm jumping really high!

03:13.194 --> 03:15.752
-Yup. Here we come.
-Wait, the pot holder

03:15.771 --> 03:16.920
is in here again?

03:16.939 --> 03:18.680
What in the name
of taco seasoning?

03:18.757 --> 03:21.575
Probably just
a freaky coincidence, but...

03:22.945 --> 03:25.370
Rosemary's Gravy!
How'd you get here?

03:26.765 --> 03:28.457
(gasps)
Hamburger Help-me.

03:29.768 --> 03:31.543
Honey Bunches of Scrotes!

03:33.105 --> 03:34.604
Honeybee,
I don't want to scare you,

03:34.623 --> 03:36.698
but I've been finding
that spooky pot holder

03:36.792 --> 03:38.291
just all over the place.

03:38.368 --> 03:40.868
Really? (gasps)
Maybe you were right about it.

03:40.963 --> 03:42.870
I can't 100% say it's haunted,

03:42.965 --> 03:44.631
but there's
no other explanation.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.450
-This pot holder?
-(screams)

03:46.468 --> 03:48.618
I just found it sitting
out on the front porch

03:48.637 --> 03:51.045
-in the rocking chair.
-Jumpin' Jeremy Irons!

03:51.065 --> 03:53.548
It's been in the shower,
my bed, the mailbox,

03:53.567 --> 03:55.141
and now the rocking chair?

03:55.294 --> 03:57.677
My hunch was right--
we got a pot holder-geist!

03:57.829 --> 03:59.312
It was only a matter of time.

03:59.465 --> 04:01.798
Every oven mitt looks
like a ghost saying hello.

04:01.817 --> 04:03.133
You ever notice that?

04:03.302 --> 04:05.911
Your pot holder is haunted?
(gasps) Congratulations.

04:06.062 --> 04:07.637
-So you all love ghosts?
-Oh, yeah.

04:07.656 --> 04:09.414
When we were little,
we would always ask Dad

04:09.566 --> 04:11.083
to build our house
on an old burial ground,

04:11.234 --> 04:13.493
but he kept saying,
"The house is already built."

04:13.570 --> 04:14.753
Not cool, Beef.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.329
Have a good time, Moon.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.982
I have an exciting evening
of spice rack reorganization

04:19.075 --> 04:21.501
-ahead of me.
-Oh, actually, Dad,

04:21.595 --> 04:23.578
I think you'd better come talk
to Henry's mom.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.580
Henry said she's trying
to cut down a 50-foot oak

04:25.599 --> 04:28.008
in her backyard,
and she thinks the best type

04:28.084 --> 04:30.102
of chain saw to use is
an electric.

04:30.329 --> 04:31.678
What?! I'd better get in there

04:31.830 --> 04:34.014
and gently talk
about the pluses and minuses

04:34.166 --> 04:35.515
of that decision.

04:35.667 --> 04:36.942
Hi, Moon. Hi, Beef.

04:37.093 --> 04:38.277
Head on downstairs, hon.

04:38.428 --> 04:40.170
I just dropped off
a tray of snacks,

04:40.263 --> 04:42.447
and you don't want to get stuck
with the celery.

04:42.599 --> 04:43.840
Celery sucks.

04:43.933 --> 04:45.342
Okay, and, uh, Dad,
before I head downstairs,

04:45.360 --> 04:48.178
just want to let you know
I may have told my friends

04:48.196 --> 04:50.680
to tell their moms you'd like
to join their moms' group.

04:50.699 --> 04:52.124
So have a great time and enjoy

04:52.275 --> 04:54.351
and don't place me for adoption,
please. Farewell.

04:54.353 --> 04:56.778
-BEEF: Hmm...
-Well, looks like
your kid tricked you.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.038
Come on in and don't worry--

04:58.190 --> 05:00.857
we're tons of fun
on some ample buns.

05:00.876 --> 05:04.303
So you...
don't need chain saw advice?

05:04.454 --> 05:07.197
Oh, please. My dad was a
door-to-door chain saw salesman.

05:07.257 --> 05:09.141
And let me tell you,
dragging a whole tree

05:09.368 --> 05:10.867
to every house was not easy.

05:10.886 --> 05:12.369
Come along, Mr. Beef.

05:12.462 --> 05:13.979
-Hmm...
-Well, what are you waiting for?

05:14.130 --> 05:16.373
You want me to carry you?
'Cause I will.

05:16.391 --> 05:17.983
You're looking at the four-time
cow-carrying champion

05:18.210 --> 05:20.710
of Fairbanks State
Veterinary College, Beef.

05:20.729 --> 05:22.637
Uh-oh. Looks like
somebody dropped a sausage

05:22.731 --> 05:26.641
-on the taco plate.
-Yup. We've got a banana growing
on the papaya tree.

05:26.718 --> 05:28.476
Ha. Um, yeah.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.070
I am a man.

05:30.222 --> 05:31.646
I am a man person.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.390
Guys, stop teasing him.

05:33.392 --> 05:35.483
Beef, we were very excited
when our kids told us

05:35.577 --> 05:37.410
you wanted to join
our little group.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.821
Pull up a cocktail
and let me pour you a chair.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.915
-Welcome to Moms' Night.
-Oh, good.

05:42.009 --> 05:45.902
I love groups
and am very comfortable in them.

05:45.995 --> 05:48.180
(clears throat)
Wonderful.

05:51.352 --> 05:53.093
Beef, what are you drinking?
I've got it all.

05:53.095 --> 05:55.579
Oh, and I've also got
some marijuana candy apples

05:55.581 --> 05:58.598
from my sister
in Sant-o Barbara, Californi-o.

05:58.600 --> 06:01.008
But proceed with caution.
I'm never having one again.

06:01.010 --> 06:02.435
I took one last Wednesday,
and my hands

06:02.588 --> 06:05.271
have just stopped feeling
like big spiders.

06:05.424 --> 06:07.107
I guess I could have an alcohol.

06:07.201 --> 06:09.559
-Now, where shall I sit? Here?
-What are... Why is he...

06:09.561 --> 06:12.445
-What is he doing?
-(chuckles) What are you
pointing at, big guy?

06:12.598 --> 06:14.431
I don't... I don't know.
I'm panicking.

06:14.449 --> 06:16.524
Marie? Make room for him
before he passes out.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.768
We won't bite.
We have a few drinks

06:18.862 --> 06:20.787
and we do a little embroidery.

06:20.939 --> 06:22.864
Sit down, sip your drink,
goss your sip.

06:22.958 --> 06:24.624
What do you know
that we don't know?

06:24.718 --> 06:28.035
We can only talk about Nancy
Smith's bushes so many times.

06:28.113 --> 06:29.554
By the way,
I'm Russell's mom Marie,

06:29.706 --> 06:31.556
and I'm the only one
who actually embroiders.

06:31.708 --> 06:34.709
These two are usually too tipsy
to handle yarn.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.878
That's not true. I crocheted
an 11-foot-long Smurf

06:36.897 --> 06:38.788
in a complete blackout once.

06:38.807 --> 06:41.215
-What do you think?
-That's amazing. What is it?

06:41.309 --> 06:43.718
It's two dolphins exchanging
birthday gifts.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.737
-They're twins.
-Powerful stuff.

06:45.889 --> 06:47.480
Well, I'm Carissa, Debbie's mom.

06:47.633 --> 06:49.241
And, yes, I'm the one
who dated the janitor.

06:49.392 --> 06:51.392
And I'm the one who hit
the school crossing guard

06:51.412 --> 06:53.561
with my car.
But she's fine.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.730
Oh, I also hit her with
my fists. Now we're friends.

06:55.824 --> 06:57.916
So, out with the gossip,
meat man. What you got?

06:58.143 --> 07:00.310
Well, you said that
you have already discussed

07:00.328 --> 07:02.646
Nancy Smith's bushes at length,

07:02.739 --> 07:05.072
but let's be honest,
her hedges have not looked neat

07:05.150 --> 07:06.574
in a very long time.

07:06.668 --> 07:08.318
Oh, snap, Tobin!

07:08.336 --> 07:11.412
-This kitty has claws.
-Meow?

07:11.432 --> 07:12.580
Guys, come on.

07:12.674 --> 07:14.415
I told some really dirty lies
to get here.

07:14.584 --> 07:16.083
Let me see the sled.

07:16.103 --> 07:19.679
Actually, we were thinking we'd
do something different tonight,

07:19.831 --> 07:20.847
like, uh...

07:20.999 --> 07:22.832
-hit this pole with our hands.
-Wow!

07:22.926 --> 07:24.834
Listen to that. Makes you think.

07:24.928 --> 07:27.854
Music is everywhere, you know?

07:27.948 --> 07:29.839
Remove the tarp, please.

07:29.858 --> 07:31.341
Okay, Moon.
We'll show it to you,

07:31.359 --> 07:33.677
but you have to promise
not to be a, a downer.

07:33.770 --> 07:35.436
Since when am I a downer?

07:35.456 --> 07:37.197
Remember when we built
that hot air balloon

07:37.349 --> 07:39.516
for my Miss Piggy hand puppet
and you said it wouldn't work?

07:39.534 --> 07:41.034
And what happened?
It didn't work.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.203
Yeah, but it was<i> fun</i>
and it didn't work.

07:43.297 --> 07:45.355
Guys, relax. I love sleds.

07:45.448 --> 07:47.299
(sighs):
Fine. Let's show it to him.

07:47.468 --> 07:49.876
See, over there
we have the toilet seat

07:50.028 --> 07:51.786
that we're going to use
as a steering wheel.

07:51.863 --> 07:53.863
It's made for people
with hemorrhoids, so it's going

07:53.882 --> 07:56.641
-to feel really soft
on our hands.
-And there's the engine.

07:56.868 --> 07:57.976
A leaf blower?

07:58.127 --> 08:00.220
And the airbag is
that bag of cheddar popcorn.

08:00.314 --> 08:02.222
This sled is... great.

08:02.316 --> 08:04.541
It's obvious you're lying.

08:04.634 --> 08:05.984
Okay, fine! It's just...

08:06.211 --> 08:07.727
that steering wheel is clearly
not actually going to steer,

08:07.896 --> 08:10.137
the leaf blower will make
the sled go way too fast,

08:10.232 --> 08:12.732
and the bag of cheddar popcorn
is not going to save your life!

08:12.826 --> 08:15.142
See? This is why we didn't want
to tell you about it.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.829
Sorry. I meant, I love it.

08:18.056 --> 08:21.391
Moon, we want you to be here,
but you cannot be a bummer.

08:21.393 --> 08:22.834
Okay. I can do it. I can be fun.

08:22.911 --> 08:26.153
Remember we went to Chuck E.
Cheese for my birthday party?

08:26.173 --> 08:28.565
For a tour of the kitchen
and management offices.

08:28.658 --> 08:30.917
We got to see
how the Cokes were made.

08:31.069 --> 08:33.086
Okay, fine, I see your point.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.071
<i> MRS. TUNTLEY:</i>
<i> So, Carissa,</i>

08:35.164 --> 08:38.332
how are things going with...
Chumbo?

08:38.426 --> 08:40.910
Well, at the movies, he said,
"My girlfriend would like

08:40.929 --> 08:42.854
some cheese sauce
for her pretzel."

08:43.081 --> 08:44.189
MRS. TUNTLEY AND MARIE:
Aw...

08:44.416 --> 08:46.416
So you two are both divorced?

08:46.434 --> 08:48.175
Yup. We're just a couple
of D-bags.

08:48.195 --> 08:51.588
I thought I was the only dad
here<i> and</i> the only divorcé.

08:51.606 --> 08:53.606
Well, you seem like
a great dad, Beef.

08:53.759 --> 08:55.775
No one blames you
for what happened with Kathleen.

08:55.944 --> 08:57.685
Yeah, it was tough
when she left.

08:57.854 --> 09:00.038
And it's been challenging being
a single parent ever since.

09:00.265 --> 09:02.207
I'm not really much
of a socializer.

09:02.358 --> 09:04.191
The only parent friends
I've ever had

09:04.211 --> 09:06.694
were some hummingbirds
that lived outside my window

09:06.713 --> 09:08.547
with their hummingbird baby
for a while.

09:08.698 --> 09:10.865
Before I started hanging out
with these two,

09:10.884 --> 09:13.552
I spent a lot of time talking
to my bathtub reflection.

09:13.703 --> 09:15.945
She's fun, but she's crazy.

09:15.964 --> 09:17.705
As a single mom,
sometimes I feel like

09:17.724 --> 09:20.207
someone's always asking me
to take over flying the plane

09:20.302 --> 09:21.785
at 35,000 feet.

09:21.878 --> 09:24.621
And you have to get all the
passengers into their pajamas

09:24.714 --> 09:27.715
and convince them to eat
the in-flight meal.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.493
-Exactly.
-I always feel better
when I talk to the girls

09:30.495 --> 09:32.312
after a couple of Dorothy's
famous rum and pokes.

09:32.388 --> 09:35.574
I hand you a glass of rum and
then I poke you in the shoulder

09:35.801 --> 09:37.058
and tell you to get talking.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.393
Well, maybe I'll come back
next week.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.228
Ah, look at us--
a classic foursome,

09:41.323 --> 09:43.748
-like<i> Sex and the City.</i>
-Or like those poor trash cans

09:43.900 --> 09:45.325
in front of the Burrito Barn.

09:45.419 --> 09:47.252
I'm the blue one.
She's super hot.

09:47.479 --> 09:49.070
<i> JUDY:</i>
<i> Okay, everyone,</i>
<i> I have deeply investigated</i>

09:49.089 --> 09:50.997
this haunted pot holder
situation,

09:51.149 --> 09:52.982
and I believe your pot holder
is being haunted

09:53.001 --> 09:54.818
by our ancestor Eugenia Tobin.

09:54.836 --> 09:57.153
She was a suffragette who hated
traditional "women's work"

09:57.172 --> 09:59.505
and was the first lady
to work at the docks.

09:59.658 --> 10:01.582
And then she died
when she fell into the oven

10:01.602 --> 10:04.585
while trying to burn
her burlap pioneer brassiere.

10:04.605 --> 10:07.421
(gasps)
And now she's
in this piece of fabric?

10:07.441 --> 10:08.589
What a world!

10:08.667 --> 10:10.016
(chuckles):
Well, she sounds very fun.

10:10.168 --> 10:12.185
I'd love to pick
her ghostly brain.

10:12.337 --> 10:15.004
Me, too.
And that's why I, AbracaJudy,

10:15.098 --> 10:17.098
have decided
we must have a séance.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.342
Uh, are you sure
you're up for a séance, Wolf?

10:19.435 --> 10:22.103
What do you mean, Ham?
My husband loves haunted stuff.

10:22.122 --> 10:25.198
Yeah. L-Let's have
that séance today-ance.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.959
Wolf, no! We need special herbs
and a Ouija board

10:28.186 --> 10:30.036
and themed snacks,
like haunted hummus

10:30.130 --> 10:31.445
and possessed pita chips.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.131
Oh, and I'll bring
otherworldly onion dip

10:33.300 --> 10:34.466
and some cursed crackers.

10:34.693 --> 10:36.526
Maybe the ghost will eat
some snacks, too.

10:36.544 --> 10:38.970
I would love to watch a
pretzel rod fly through the air

10:39.122 --> 10:41.956
and then get chomped
by an unseen presence.

10:42.050 --> 10:43.475
<i> BEEF:</i>
<i> I know this is very catty,</i>

10:43.626 --> 10:46.202
but Stephanie at the post office
said she had no tape

10:46.221 --> 10:49.630
for me to use,
but behind her I could see tape.

10:49.724 --> 10:52.150
Oh, Chumbo's been going to
the post office in Death Cliff.

10:52.260 --> 10:54.560
That way he gets more time
with his fancy new snow machine.

10:54.729 --> 10:56.713
He tricked it all out.
It has a new sound system

10:56.882 --> 10:59.232
so we can go
on smooth jazz rides together.

10:59.384 --> 11:00.508
Oh, that's so romantic.

11:00.568 --> 11:01.642
You guys holding on
to each other,

11:01.811 --> 11:03.144
listening to Kenny G.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.163
Jamie plays the flute
for Russell and I every morning.

11:05.314 --> 11:06.890
Here's the snow machine
and here's Chumbo.

11:06.983 --> 11:11.077
I know he's a bit of a wild man,
but my ex was a real drip.

11:11.229 --> 11:12.319
Chumbo makes me forget

11:12.488 --> 11:13.913
I'm a 47-year-old lady
with a mortgage,

11:13.990 --> 11:15.489
a weak pelvic floor,
and a slight--

11:15.583 --> 11:17.825
I mean teeny-tiny--
kleptomania problem.

11:17.903 --> 11:21.495
-He sounds great.
-To Chumbo and Carissa!

11:21.515 --> 11:22.906
(Beef sighs)

11:22.924 --> 11:24.665
Well, if it isn't
the famous Chumbo.

11:24.685 --> 11:27.686
And it looks like he's fetched
a soda for Carissa.

11:27.837 --> 11:29.521
He is complete BM:

11:29.672 --> 11:31.247
boyfriend material.

11:31.340 --> 11:32.673
Baby, you want a piece of ice?

11:32.767 --> 11:34.100
You know I do.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.935
Give me that ice.
Give me some ice, baby.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.029
BEEF:
Uh-oh. That's not Carissa.

11:38.181 --> 11:41.324
He's the other type of BM:
bad man.

11:44.429 --> 11:46.279
So, you saw your new friend
Carissa's dude kissing

11:46.355 --> 11:49.432
-on another lady
in a parking lot.
-Yes, and indulging in--

11:49.434 --> 11:52.602
and pardon me for being
so graphic-- "ice-play."

11:52.695 --> 11:54.454
And you didn't call her
right away to tell her?

11:54.548 --> 11:56.548
No. Carissa really likes
this Chumbo,

11:56.699 --> 11:58.791
and I don't want her feelings
to get hurt.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.534
But imagine
how she's gonna feel

12:00.554 --> 12:02.295
if she finds out he's cheating
and that you knew.

12:02.447 --> 12:05.372
(groans) The thing is, back
before Kathleen and I split up,

12:05.392 --> 12:08.634
my friend Gordon told me
he walked in on her and Marcus

12:08.787 --> 12:10.895
making out in the bathroom
at the library.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.306
And for some reason,
I felt mad at Gordon

12:13.400 --> 12:15.216
and never talked to him again.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.569
What if I tell Carissa,
and she gets upset with me

12:17.796 --> 12:19.404
and kicks me out of Moms' Night?

12:19.573 --> 12:21.814
No more bonding?
No more dirty mom-tinis?

12:21.908 --> 12:23.967
No more insulting
Nancy Smith's bushes?

12:24.027 --> 12:26.077
-Her bushes are so disorganized!
-WOLF: You know,

12:26.229 --> 12:27.820
I once had to tell
my friend Cheesecake

12:27.914 --> 12:30.064
that his girlfriend took out
a life insurance policy on him.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.899
And at first
he thought I was just jealous

12:31.918 --> 12:33.476
that they were spending
so much time together.

12:33.495 --> 12:35.903
And I was.
But then he found a machete

12:35.981 --> 12:37.663
under her bed
that had his name on it.

12:37.816 --> 12:39.758
Yeah, she'd stuck it on there
with a Post-it note.

12:39.985 --> 12:41.501
And once he saw that,
he understood.

12:41.653 --> 12:43.261
Part of the reason
we're still friends today

12:43.412 --> 12:44.763
is because he
didn't get murdered.

12:44.990 --> 12:48.249
So you guys think the best
thing to do is tell Carissa?

12:48.268 --> 12:50.676
-I do, Dad.
-Beef, yes.

12:50.829 --> 12:52.328
I better give this a think.

12:52.347 --> 12:53.938
Perhaps I'll make another canoe.

12:54.165 --> 12:56.257
Dad, there are already seven
in the shed.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.092
And three in the basement.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.669
<i> JUDY:</i>
<i> It's time to put on</i>

12:59.687 --> 13:01.504
the ceremonial robes.

13:01.523 --> 13:02.672
Aka our old karate gis.

13:02.690 --> 13:05.116
JUDY: And now let
the rituals commence.

13:05.268 --> 13:07.844
To the spirit who sings
a ghostly note,

13:07.937 --> 13:10.196
come out, Eugenia,
and to us spoke.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.532
Great rhyme, Judy.
The only thing ghosts love more

13:12.684 --> 13:14.942
-than rituals are rhymes.
-Time for the next ritual.

13:15.036 --> 13:16.944
Ham, did you bring the blood
for us to drink?

13:17.038 --> 13:18.946
I didn't want to sacrifice
any animals,

13:19.040 --> 13:21.115
but I did find
this Chobani strawberry yogurt.

13:21.209 --> 13:22.449
It's kind of red.

13:22.544 --> 13:23.951
And it has cow in it.

13:24.045 --> 13:26.546
-Spooky.
-Let's pass it around.

13:26.698 --> 13:30.124
Okay, well, I think tonight
I'll just head home, so...

13:30.218 --> 13:31.643
Get in here, Beef-butt!

13:31.794 --> 13:33.144
Oh, no, she saw me.

13:33.296 --> 13:34.554
Marie made her Marie-garitas!

13:34.648 --> 13:36.539
They have 16 kinds of alcohol
in 'em!

13:36.632 --> 13:41.210
(takes deep breath)
And I am going to need
all 16 kinds.

13:41.229 --> 13:44.638
(robotically):
How is everyone
this fine evening?

13:44.732 --> 13:47.733
(laughs):
Beef, why are you talking
like a robot?

13:47.886 --> 13:49.552
BEEF (quietly):
Oh, no.

13:49.571 --> 13:50.662
Ice.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.739
-Oh, God.
-What is it, Beef?
Do you have diarrhea?

13:53.834 --> 13:57.151
Jamie always says "Oh, God"
when he has diarrhea.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.395
No, it's... Carissa,

13:59.488 --> 14:01.172
there's something
I have to tell you. I...

14:01.399 --> 14:03.749
I saw Chumbo in
the Maude's All Day parking lot

14:03.844 --> 14:06.069
sharing ice with another woman.

14:06.162 --> 14:08.847
And then he shared...
kissing with that woman.

14:08.998 --> 14:10.998
-(gasps)
-What?! Chum, no.

14:11.167 --> 14:13.076
-I'm so sorry.
-(sobbing)

14:13.094 --> 14:16.079
This is gonna be the best night
of our lives!

14:16.172 --> 14:19.265
You know what? It was fun to let
go and enjoy making this sled.

14:19.417 --> 14:20.583
Of course it was fun,

14:20.676 --> 14:22.026
even though I had to hang out
with you guys.

14:22.178 --> 14:23.769
If we break the sound barrier
on this sled

14:23.864 --> 14:25.104
and you guys
can't hear me talking,

14:25.256 --> 14:26.698
just know that
I'm calling you all losers.

14:26.849 --> 14:29.683
(scoffs): I'm not sure
we'll achieve that exact speed.

14:29.777 --> 14:31.035
-Moon...
-Sorry, I forgot.

14:31.187 --> 14:32.778
Yes, we'll probably break
the sound barrier

14:32.931 --> 14:35.707
-and Debbie will call us losers.
-That's more like it.

14:35.858 --> 14:38.192
We're gonna go so fast,
it'll tear all of my hair off.

14:38.286 --> 14:40.269
I've always wanted to be bald.

14:40.288 --> 14:41.938
-Like Jamie.
-All right,

14:42.031 --> 14:44.273
-we'll launch from here.
-MOON: Oh...

14:44.367 --> 14:45.458
no.

14:45.610 --> 14:46.442
Come on, Moon, get on.

14:46.461 --> 14:47.552
Guys, wait.

14:47.779 --> 14:49.612
I'm trying really hard
not to be a buzzkill,

14:49.705 --> 14:52.281
but I'm afraid that this sled
might be an us-kill.

14:52.300 --> 14:53.966
As in it might actually kill us.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.668
It's just sledding down
a big old hill

14:55.803 --> 14:58.621
-towards a frozen lake, Moon.
-Dread Sled or die trying.

14:58.640 --> 15:00.473
Russell! Prepare to launch.

15:00.625 --> 15:02.308
All right, buddy,
it's your time to shine.

15:02.460 --> 15:03.993
This is why I brought you.

15:03.995 --> 15:05.886
Okay, then at least
let me give each of you

15:05.906 --> 15:07.888
a very big hug goodbye.

15:07.908 --> 15:10.742
-Ugh.
-And a hug to you, Debbie.

15:10.893 --> 15:13.077
-(groaning)
-And, Henry, also a hug.

15:13.229 --> 15:15.655
And, Russell, one more hug.

15:15.749 --> 15:18.249
And just, you know, I love you.

15:18.401 --> 15:20.734
Aw. I love you, too, pal.

15:20.828 --> 15:22.995
-Moon!
-I'm just gonna stay here
and practice fishing.

15:23.164 --> 15:25.739
This attitude is exactly
why we didn't want to tell you

15:25.759 --> 15:27.074
about the sled.

15:27.168 --> 15:28.501
I know. I'm a downer.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.245
And it's best that you
leave me behind and go enjoy

15:31.264 --> 15:35.082
whatever our chaotic universe
brings to you this evening.

15:35.176 --> 15:37.160
Turn the blower on!

15:37.253 --> 15:39.662
-(whooping)
-(laughing)

15:39.755 --> 15:41.998
-DEBBIE: What moron put
that giant tree there?
-Oh, no!

15:42.016 --> 15:43.316
(screaming)

15:45.779 --> 15:48.947
Oh, my God, we could have,
like, really died.

15:49.098 --> 15:50.690
Like, a lot.

15:50.784 --> 15:53.934
-Moon, you saved us.
-Thank you.

15:54.028 --> 15:56.529
Just practicing my fishing,
like I said.

15:56.681 --> 15:58.864
You do kind of burst our bubble
sometimes,

15:59.017 --> 16:00.850
but it's smart of us
to keep you around.

16:00.868 --> 16:04.520
-Thanks for being boring.
-Yeah. Sorry we left you out.

16:04.539 --> 16:07.373
-It won't happen again.
-If you're so smart at sleds
like an idiot,

16:07.525 --> 16:09.116
you should take a look
at our bat-a-pult.

16:09.210 --> 16:11.360
It's supposed to launch live
bats at our enemies' houses,

16:11.379 --> 16:12.953
but the bats keep biting us.

16:12.973 --> 16:15.548
(scoffs)
Well, I can tell you up front
that the problem is,

16:15.717 --> 16:18.309
you should not be near any bats
at any time.

16:18.386 --> 16:20.812
-But have you considered rats?
-That's a thought.

16:20.963 --> 16:24.631
And you all really, really,
really need to get rabies shots,

16:24.800 --> 16:26.876
like right away, like tonight.

16:26.894 --> 16:28.987
<i> BEEF:</i>
<i> And if you don't want to be</i>
<i> my friend anymore</i>

16:29.138 --> 16:31.972
-because I told you,
I understand.
-(sobbing)

16:32.066 --> 16:34.492
I very much enjoyed my time
as one of the moms,

16:34.643 --> 16:38.830
but I can leave now, and you can
again be a classic threesome,

16:38.981 --> 16:40.740
like the Rice Krispies children.

16:40.816 --> 16:42.041
Beef, no. You should stay.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.168
We can't just let Chumbo
get away with this.

16:44.395 --> 16:46.062
-Should we kill him?
-Yes.

16:46.231 --> 16:47.913
Ah, I don't think
we should kill him.

16:48.082 --> 16:50.916
But I may have a different,
also good idea.

16:51.069 --> 16:52.844
Perhaps we show old Chumbo

16:53.071 --> 16:56.639
that sometimes ice is a dish
best served cold.

16:59.260 --> 17:02.078
If it's ice Chumbo loves
so much, let's give him

17:02.096 --> 17:04.338
the biggest piece of ice
he's ever seen.

17:04.432 --> 17:07.007
Oh, I can't believe
we're mischief-ing someone.

17:07.101 --> 17:08.675
I've never mischief'd anyone
before.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.862
Oh, unless you count the time
I accidentally handed Jamie

17:11.013 --> 17:12.864
the sugar instead of the salt
at the table,

17:12.940 --> 17:14.515
and he ate sweet cod for dinner.

17:14.609 --> 17:16.701
He loved it,
and now I make it once a week.

17:16.852 --> 17:19.186
-There it is.
-Ugh! Looks like that thing
did a bunch of cocaine,

17:19.280 --> 17:22.448
then got into an accident
with a disco ball on the sun.

17:22.600 --> 17:24.709
And not the good cocaine.
That college cocaine.

17:24.860 --> 17:26.711
He gave me this extra key
to his snow machine,

17:26.938 --> 17:28.046
because in the event
of his death,

17:28.273 --> 17:29.863
he wanted me
to strap his corpse to it

17:29.883 --> 17:31.532
and light it on fire
with a flaming arrow

17:31.551 --> 17:33.885
so he could ride it
into the gates of Valhalla.

17:34.112 --> 17:35.720
Don't you mean
<i> through</i> the gates?

17:35.963 --> 17:37.204
No. He said "into the gates."

17:37.223 --> 17:39.057
Let's get it into the dumpster
over there.

17:39.284 --> 17:42.060
All right, I believe a hose
is located just there.

17:42.211 --> 17:43.394
-Got it.
-Great.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.379
Throw it over the side.
I'm gonna duct-tape

17:45.398 --> 17:47.714
all the cracks in the dumpster
to make it watertight.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.809
Good thing I refreshed
the roll of duct tape

17:49.961 --> 17:51.794
in my duct tape pocket
this morning.

17:51.813 --> 17:53.554
Turn on the hose.

17:53.648 --> 17:55.889
At the current temperatures,
the snow machine will be frozen

17:55.967 --> 17:57.650
into a big block of ice

17:57.802 --> 18:01.137
by the time Chumbo's finished
his Monster Energy Mojitos.

18:01.230 --> 18:02.580
It's the perfect revenge.

18:02.807 --> 18:04.490
Yeah. But I'm also gonna burn
his smooth jazz collection,

18:04.567 --> 18:06.325
throw out all
of his takeout leftovers,

18:06.419 --> 18:08.753
and then just absolutely destroy
his dojo.

18:08.980 --> 18:10.313
Oh, I feel so alive!

18:10.331 --> 18:12.481
Should we all go to Dairy Queen
and get Blizzards?

18:12.575 --> 18:15.075
-It's open until 9:30.
-I don't see why not.

18:15.095 --> 18:17.486
(laughs):
We really are
a classic foursome,

18:17.505 --> 18:20.414
just like the Little Women,
except we're big women

18:20.433 --> 18:21.933
and I'm a man.

18:22.160 --> 18:24.994
All right, now that we finished
that possibly very, very expired

18:25.129 --> 18:27.179
Chobani yogurt/blood offering,

18:27.332 --> 18:28.998
it's time to say the chant.

18:29.016 --> 18:31.000
ALL:
Double, double,
pot holder trouble.

18:31.018 --> 18:34.019
Spirits speak
into earthly bubble.

18:34.114 --> 18:35.929
-Aah!
-Holy hairspray!

18:35.949 --> 18:38.507
The yogurt jumped
off the table by itself!

18:38.601 --> 18:40.025
Oh, my God,
there's definitely a ghost here.

18:40.194 --> 18:42.286
We must've messed up
the ritual and upset Eugenia,

18:42.438 --> 18:43.846
and now she's attacking us!

18:43.865 --> 18:45.348
She's going to kill us!

18:45.366 --> 18:48.017
-(sobbing): Oh, no, no, no...
-Wolf, babe, calm down.

18:48.035 --> 18:51.203
-Eugenia is not going
to kill us.
-You can't stop her, Honeybee.

18:51.356 --> 18:53.447
She's more powerful
than you could ever imagine.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.449
-(Wolf gasping)
-Uh-oh, the ghost panic is back.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.042
Okay, let's get a chair
behind him.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.137
-Sit down.
-Drink.
-I don't think I can!

18:59.364 --> 19:02.198
-I think I'm hyperventilating.
-Guys, what is going on?

19:02.216 --> 19:04.717
Wolf's having a little
panic attack about ghosts.

19:04.869 --> 19:07.203
This used to happen all the time
when we were kids.

19:07.221 --> 19:08.795
One time he saw a napkin blowing
in the breeze

19:08.815 --> 19:11.223
-and he threw up.
-But Wolf loves movies
about ghosts.

19:11.376 --> 19:12.633
Movies are different,

19:12.652 --> 19:14.652
because he knows
there's craft services there.

19:14.803 --> 19:16.379
To calm himself down,
he pictures a phantom

19:16.397 --> 19:19.231
-eating a turkey cheese roll-up.
-We thought he grew out of this!

19:19.384 --> 19:20.140
Me, too.

19:20.234 --> 19:23.219
But it is happening!

19:23.312 --> 19:24.904
Oh, no! I didn't know.
This is my fault.

19:24.998 --> 19:27.223
The pot holder
wasn't actually haunted.

19:27.316 --> 19:29.225
Eugenia wasn't moving it around.
It was me!

19:29.243 --> 19:31.727
-(gasping)
-What?
-I was the one moving it around.

19:31.746 --> 19:33.229
So you'd think it was haunted.
The first time

19:33.247 --> 19:35.231
I genuinely had no idea
why the pot holder had moved.

19:35.324 --> 19:36.749
But once I saw
how excited you were,

19:36.843 --> 19:39.326
I wanted to let you believe.
I hadn't seen you that excited

19:39.345 --> 19:41.737
since we saw
<i> Scream 8: Still Screaming.</i>

19:41.830 --> 19:42.755
(labored breathing):
Great movie.

19:42.924 --> 19:44.665
Neve Campbell is ba...

19:44.759 --> 19:45.999
Oh, no! He fainted!

19:46.093 --> 19:48.168
-Nope. I'm here, baby.
-Oh, thank God.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.336
Babe, I thought I lost you.

19:49.505 --> 19:50.930
You didn't lose me.
I mean, sure,

19:51.082 --> 19:53.082
my heart rate is probably
in the 300s right now,

19:53.175 --> 19:55.601
but you creating
this scary experience for me

19:55.695 --> 19:57.102
was still very thoughtful.

19:57.255 --> 19:58.604
You're the perfect wife.

19:58.681 --> 20:00.698
And you'll make
a wonderful ghost someday.

20:00.925 --> 20:03.926
MARIE:
That was probably the most fun
I've ever had.

20:03.945 --> 20:05.185
-(chuckles): Me, too.
-Me, too.

20:05.205 --> 20:07.354
Ooh, I just wish
we could have seen his face

20:07.373 --> 20:08.873
when he found that ice-mobile.

20:09.042 --> 20:11.450
(laughs)
I'm guessing it was
a pretty angry face

20:11.577 --> 20:13.711
based on all
of the text messages he sent me.

20:13.938 --> 20:15.379
Suck on that, Chum-blow.

20:15.531 --> 20:18.216
Look. He sent a picture of it
in the ice,

20:18.367 --> 20:20.384
and a bunch
of middle finger emojis.

20:20.611 --> 20:24.129
And also the pray hands?
But I think that was a mistake.

20:24.206 --> 20:25.223
Nice, nice, baby!

20:25.374 --> 20:27.725
(laughs)
Crunch on that ice, bud!

20:27.876 --> 20:29.209
Well, that was fun.

20:29.229 --> 20:31.395
(sighs)
But I guess
I am on my own again now.

20:31.547 --> 20:33.622
You're not on your own.
You have us.

20:33.641 --> 20:36.976
And Chumbo is a fool
for taking you for granted.

20:37.128 --> 20:38.569
Thanks, Beef.
And just so you know,

20:38.796 --> 20:41.981
-Kathleen was a fool, too.
-Oh. I wish I had had you guys

20:42.133 --> 20:43.724
to talk to back then.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.651
Huh. I was
a little bit of a mess.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.152
(chuckles)
Hey, speaking of messes,

20:47.305 --> 20:49.580
have you guys seen
Nancy Smith's new flower beds?

20:49.732 --> 20:50.748
Chrysanthemums?

20:50.899 --> 20:53.400
More like
I'd-like-to-barf-on-'ems.

20:53.494 --> 20:54.585
Damn, Tobin.
