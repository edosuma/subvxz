No, I am not a Nazi.
I'm not political at all.

they stand for something
hopeful in Germany.

really believe that.

07:54.140 --> 07:58.727

to justify Hitler?

08:02.690 --> 08:06.860
That Hitler will bring us
a better life.

08:06.944 --> 08:08.904
Is the life you have now
so terrible?

08:08.988 --> 08:11.865
No, but, uh‒
My life is not so terrible,

08:11.949 --> 08:15.327
but I don't wish to spend
the rest of it wearing
fancy sweaters...

08:15.411 --> 08:17.787
and teaching fat little
children how to ski...

08:17.872 --> 08:19.915
and being charming
and picturesque.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.167
I can understand
your wanting more than that.

08:22.251 --> 08:25.921
I think, perhaps, you cannot
understand what it means...

08:26.005 --> 08:30.926
to live on tips
from foreigners
in your own country.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.306
You know what I really am?

08:36.390 --> 08:39.768
I'm not
a ski instructor even.

08:39.852 --> 08:43.647
I do this for two
or three months in the year.

08:43.731 --> 08:47.108
When the season
is over, I go to work
in a little shop...

08:47.193 --> 08:51.196
as an assistant
to my father,
and I'm a shoemaker.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.282
And you don't want
to be a shoemaker?
No, I don't.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.494
I want to be something else.
Then you don't
have to remain one.

08:57.578 --> 09:02.040
Oh, this is
not the United States.

09:02.124 --> 09:04.751
It's so hard
to explain to you.

09:04.835 --> 09:07.337
But you see,
it's very difficult...

09:07.421 --> 09:11.675
for people to rise above
their class in Europe.

09:11.759 --> 09:14.302
I tell you something.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.305
At one time, I wanted
very much to be a doctor.

09:18.724 --> 09:21.893
And I worked
very hard for this.

09:21.978 --> 09:27.232
And when there was no
longer any money, I was
forced to give it up...

09:27.316 --> 09:31.069
because we have
no free university here.

09:31.153 --> 09:35.156
And I think this is‒
this is where Hitler
can help us.

09:35.241 --> 09:39.828
I think that he‒
he has promised
to change all this.

09:39.912 --> 09:44.583
Christian, Hitler promises
to conquer the whole world.

09:44.667 --> 09:48.378
Ja. But this is
a direct result...

09:48.462 --> 09:51.339
of a handful of completely
insane fanatics‒

09:51.424 --> 09:53.300
Oh.
Yeah.

09:53.384 --> 09:55.510
It was, and this will pass.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.096
It will not pass!

09:58.180 --> 10:01.182
It's going to get worse
and worse and worse.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.810
And I think it's
going to end in war.

10:08.524 --> 10:12.611
I think that we should
not discuss this...

10:12.695 --> 10:16.656
because I don't know
all the answers.

10:16.741 --> 10:19.659
I know you don't know
all the answers.

10:19.744 --> 10:23.288
And with political discussions
we go round and round,

10:23.372 --> 10:26.124
and nothing is ever settled.

10:27.710 --> 10:30.795
Let's go back in
and have a nice time.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.715
Come on.♪♪

10:45.561 --> 10:47.520
No.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.857
Good night, Christian.

10:50.941 --> 10:53.902
I'll say good-bye
in the morning.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.673
This is the BBC, London.

11:14.757 --> 11:20.345
Today, June 24, 1940,
at 7:15 PM,

11:20.429 --> 11:24.140
France surrendered to Germany.

11:24.225 --> 11:27.268
The events of the past 45 days,
beginning with
the German invasion...

11:27.353 --> 11:32.065
of the low countries on May 10,
have thus come
to a tragic climax.

11:32.149 --> 11:34.609
England, now fighting
virtually alone,

11:34.694 --> 11:37.737
faces the German military power
whose aim to conquer...

11:37.822 --> 11:40.240
or destroy the entire
civilized world...

11:40.324 --> 11:42.909
can no longer be questioned.

11:42.993 --> 11:45.245
In the words of
Mr. Winston Churchill,

11:45.329 --> 11:49.916
"What General Vegar has called
the Battle of France is over.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.335
The Battle of Britain
is about to begin."

11:52.420 --> 11:57.215
Leutnant, I do wish you'd
order your driver to slow down.

11:57.299 --> 12:02.053
I am reluctantly willing
to die for the fatherland,
but not in a traffic accident.

12:02.138 --> 12:05.890
We're late, Brandt.
Go a little faster, Basserman.

12:05.975 --> 12:08.184
But we almost hit a cow
back there.

12:08.269 --> 12:11.146
The only living thing
we have seen all afternoon.

12:11.230 --> 12:14.065
Where is everybody?

12:14.150 --> 12:16.067
Making love, drinking absinthe.

12:16.152 --> 12:20.155
You know the French.
Don't you read our papers?
Where are they?

12:20.239 --> 12:23.992
When I was a little boy,
I promised my father
I'd kill a Frenchman for him.

12:24.076 --> 12:27.746
They shot off his leg
in Verdun, ja, in 1916.

12:27.830 --> 12:31.082
So I promised him‒
on Christmas eve it was‒

12:31.167 --> 12:34.502
I promised I'd shoot
a Frenchman for him.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.839
Have you ever
been to Paris?

12:37.923 --> 12:40.091
No, I have not been there.

12:40.176 --> 12:43.678
Oh, what a city.
What a wonderful city
that is.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.181
I'll show you
a good time there.

12:46.265 --> 12:50.310
You won't keep those people
indoors forever,
not those Parisians.

12:50.394 --> 12:53.855
Ah, what wonderful girls.

12:53.939 --> 12:58.109
When I was a correspondent
there last year, we practically
lived in the streets.

12:58.194 --> 13:01.946
Simone and I‒
We will show you Paris
the way it always was,

13:02.031 --> 13:03.990
the way it always will be.

13:39.610 --> 13:42.529
Basserman, go up to the wall
and keep firing on them...

13:42.613 --> 13:44.531
in case they try to come
to the front, ja.

13:44.615 --> 13:47.033
Ja.

14:00.422 --> 14:02.340
Go!

14:11.016 --> 14:12.976
Come on.

14:37.334 --> 14:40.044
Maeschen, stay behind
this tree here.

14:40.129 --> 14:44.048
I go over behind the tree
over there.
Jawohl.

15:06.405 --> 15:09.490
I got him.
I got him.

15:09.575 --> 15:12.118
Maeschen, stay down!

15:31.680 --> 15:34.557
Streicher, hold your fire.

15:45.152 --> 15:47.028
Streicher.

15:56.538 --> 16:00.208
Brandt.
Streicher, come on.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.927
Brandt.

16:12.680 --> 16:15.974
Tell him to go back and
tell the others to surrender...

16:16.058 --> 16:18.309
because we now have them
in a cross fire.

16:18.394 --> 16:23.147
Go. Allez.

16:24.441 --> 16:26.401
Écoutez-moi.

16:27.444 --> 16:31.197
Maeschen is dead?
What? What?

16:31.281 --> 16:33.449
Maeschen is dead?

16:33.534 --> 16:35.451
Yeah.

16:35.536 --> 16:37.662
I'm sure his father
is very happy now, eh?

16:37.746 --> 16:40.289
Allez! Allez!
Vite!

16:51.010 --> 16:53.469
Arretez!

16:53.554 --> 16:56.055
Arretez!

16:57.099 --> 16:59.308
Nous sommes fichus!

17:39.391 --> 17:43.978
Captain Hardenburg.
Ah, Diestl.
Nice to see you.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.482
I understand you have had
a little difficulty on the road.
Yes, sir.

17:47.566 --> 17:49.484
At ease.
Thank you, sir.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.861
There were young conscripts,
sir, making a token gesture.

17:51.945 --> 17:54.405
There was a roadblock,
and it was quite unavoidable.

17:54.490 --> 17:57.784
There is no need
to be apologetic.
It makes for excellent training.

17:57.868 --> 18:01.370
I want to commend you
for the way you have handled it.
Thank you, sir.

18:01.455 --> 18:06.250
We had one casualty,
you know, sir.
Private Maeschen was killed.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.628
Oh, yes.
Uh, Private Maeschen.

18:10.047 --> 18:12.090
Did he perform his duty?

18:12.174 --> 18:14.634
Yes, sir.
He killed one of the enemy
with his first shot...

18:14.718 --> 18:18.429
and then became excited
and failed to take cover.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.474
Too bad.
I'm sure he fought bravely.

18:23.602 --> 18:26.521
That's wonderful,
isn't it?

18:26.605 --> 18:28.481
Yes, sir.

18:28.565 --> 18:31.109
Sir, with your permission,
I would like to write a letter
to his family.

18:31.193 --> 18:34.862
Never mind, Diestl.
I will do it.
Leutnant!

18:38.826 --> 18:43.037
Since you are attached to us,
I wonder if you would mind
taking a photograph for my wife.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.039
We had always
planned to come here.

18:45.124 --> 18:48.918
It would be a pleasure,
Captain.
Come on, Diestl.

18:49.002 --> 18:52.463
I'm sure your wife
is not interested to see me.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

18:52.548 --> 18:57.468
I've written her about you
and many of the men.
I'm sure she's most interested.

18:59.096 --> 19:01.389
Just a moment.

19:01.473 --> 19:05.101
We will stand on the steps.
Come on, Diestl.

19:05.185 --> 19:07.186
With the church
in the background.

19:18.240 --> 19:21.659
A great day.
A day of historic importance.

19:21.743 --> 19:24.620
In years to come, we will
look back on this and say...

19:24.705 --> 19:28.624
we were there at the dawn
of the new era.

19:30.919 --> 19:33.337
Ay! Ja. Now, Captain,
this is the one.

19:46.268 --> 19:49.353
All right, settle down.

19:49.438 --> 19:51.355
Settle down!

19:51.440 --> 19:53.357
This is
New York City property.

19:53.442 --> 19:56.277
Stop spitting and throwing butts
on the floor and stop shoving.

19:56.361 --> 20:00.489
Nobody's gonna be left behind.
The army's got plenty of room
for everybody.

20:06.038 --> 20:09.123
What's wrong?
It's cold.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.209
Now cough.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.252
Turn your head and cough.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.426
All right, breathe in.

20:25.515 --> 20:27.433
Breathe out.

20:27.517 --> 20:29.769
Now breathe in.

20:29.853 --> 20:31.812
Out.

20:33.815 --> 20:35.733
All right, bend over.

20:35.817 --> 20:38.736
Bend over
and touch your toes.
Oh.

20:40.322 --> 20:42.406
Okay.

20:42.491 --> 20:45.576
For a man your age
in your profession,
you're in excellent health.

20:45.661 --> 20:49.830
How do you manage it?
Clean liquor.

20:49.915 --> 20:53.334
Give this to the board.
Next man.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.670
You didn't register
in California?

20:55.754 --> 20:59.423
Yes, I did.
But I came east before
I got my classification.

20:59.508 --> 21:03.427
You came to New York
to get a defense job?
To get any job.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.513
Michael Whiteacre.

21:12.604 --> 21:15.523
Sit down over here,
Mr. Whiteacre.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.865
You must be very busy,
Mr. Whiteacre.

21:24.950 --> 21:28.327
I'm told we had a special call
from Selective Service
headquarters...

21:28.412 --> 21:31.956
asking us not to waste
any of your valuable time.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.375
Well, I'm rehearsing a show
against a deadline.

21:34.459 --> 21:37.044
Well, we'll try
to rush you through quickly.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.255
How long will this show run,
do you think?

21:39.339 --> 21:42.049
I don't know.
No one ever does.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.051
Well, this is March.

21:44.136 --> 21:47.930
If it runs very long
your understudy
will get a break.

21:48.015 --> 21:51.642
We're booking you
for Uncle Sam as of June 15.

21:51.727 --> 21:54.395
I don't think that's quite fair.
You can file an appeal,
if you like.

21:54.479 --> 21:56.564
Oh, I'll appeal.

21:56.648 --> 22:00.276
Is there anything else
you'd like to discuss?
No, I'll just appeal.

22:00.360 --> 22:03.237
Just see
the secretary outside.

22:07.534 --> 22:09.452
Ackerman.

22:11.663 --> 22:13.914
Sit down over here,
Mr. Ackerman.

22:19.171 --> 22:22.673
Mr. Ackerman,
you don't seem to have
any dependent relatives...

22:22.758 --> 22:26.761
or any occupation essential
to national defense.

22:26.845 --> 22:31.807
Can you think of any reason
why you should not be
classified 1 -A?

22:31.892 --> 22:35.227
No, sir, I can't.

22:35.312 --> 22:37.521
I see you work for Macy's.

22:37.606 --> 22:42.318
You'll stay for the Easter rush,
and you will report June 15.

22:42.402 --> 22:45.654
I think that'll be all.

22:45.739 --> 22:47.907
Thank you very much.

22:52.079 --> 22:54.622
Just a moment.
May I have your form, please?

22:54.706 --> 22:56.874
Ralph Benton.

22:56.958 --> 23:00.419
Anybody got a cigarette?

23:00.504 --> 23:04.465
Need a cigarette?
Oh, thanks.

23:08.303 --> 23:10.262
Here.

23:12.641 --> 23:14.934
How do you spell
"extenuating"?

23:15.018 --> 23:17.812
Hmm?
Extenuating.

23:17.896 --> 23:19.814
Uh, I don't know.

23:19.898 --> 23:22.483
E-x-t-e‒ No.
E-x-t--

23:22.567 --> 23:24.527
Illiteracy, that'll do it.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.157
I heard you sing
a lot of times.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.159
Oh, you have?
At the club?

23:32.244 --> 23:34.662
On the radio.
Oh.

23:34.746 --> 23:38.165
Are you singing at a club?
No, rehearsing a show.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.167
On Broadway?
Mm-hmm.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.211
What's the name of it?

23:42.295 --> 23:44.171
Soft Shoes.

23:44.256 --> 23:47.883
Soft Shoes.
I gotta remember that.

23:47.968 --> 23:50.553
Let's have a drink.
Don't frustrate me.

23:50.637 --> 23:53.806
Anybody that can't spell
extenuating is a friend of mine.

23:53.890 --> 23:56.475
Come on.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.691
You know, sometimes I think
I give off a scent or something.

24:03.775 --> 24:05.860
You know,
rouses the female.
Hmm?

24:05.944 --> 24:07.862
Those girls.
Where?

24:07.946 --> 24:10.656
Oh, wait a minute.
You mean to tell me
that you didn't--

24:10.740 --> 24:14.076
Oh, your antenna's
turned off.
No, I didn't notice.

24:14.161 --> 24:16.078
Oh, you're sick.

24:18.165 --> 24:21.375
Have you ever had a girl?
Have I ever had a girl?

24:21.460 --> 24:23.377
That's what I thought.

24:23.462 --> 24:27.715
Listen, Ackerman,
tonight I'm giving a party.
Girls, females, broads.

24:27.799 --> 24:31.760
You will attend.
You will capture one and
carry her off to your cave.

24:31.845 --> 24:34.680
You will attend?
Sure. Yeah.

24:34.764 --> 24:39.393
Good. Let us not discuss
this sort of topic any longer.
Let us discuss alcohol.

25:18.433 --> 25:21.060
That's all right.
I was listening to the music.

25:23.104 --> 25:26.023
Michael's told me
all about you.

25:26.107 --> 25:30.152
He has?
Y-Yes.

25:30.237 --> 25:34.782
No, I meant,
I only met him this morning
at the draft board.

25:35.951 --> 25:39.453
You met Michael
at the draft board?
Yes.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.455
And he was 1 -A?

25:41.540 --> 25:44.458
We're both 1 -A.

26:06.731 --> 26:09.608
Hi, Hope.
Hi, Mike.
How are you?

26:09.693 --> 26:12.069
Fine. How are you?
I want you to meet somebody.
Good.

26:12.153 --> 26:14.071
Oh? Friend of yours?
Yes.

26:15.824 --> 26:19.743
Noah, this is Hope Plowman.
Noah Ackerman.

26:19.828 --> 26:21.745
Hello.
How do you do?

26:21.830 --> 26:25.040
See if you can cheer
him up. I don't think
he likes my music.

26:27.127 --> 26:31.046
Actually,
I haven't been listening.

26:32.966 --> 26:35.676
Oh, my,
what a lovely view.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.720
Isn't it?

26:43.184 --> 26:46.270
Yes, Margaret?

26:46.354 --> 26:48.314
I hear you're being drafted.

26:55.113 --> 26:59.783
I'm not being drafted.
Mr. Ackerman says you are.

26:59.868 --> 27:04.121
Mr. Ackerman doesn't know
what rabbits can be pulled out
of a hat in Washington.

27:04.205 --> 27:06.874
Look, I'm not a hero,
and I'm not a pigeon.

27:06.958 --> 27:09.126
The pigeons can do
my fighting for me.

27:09.210 --> 27:11.462
Oh, Michael,
what's the matter with you?

27:11.546 --> 27:13.922
You think I hate you
for trying to get out of it?

27:14.007 --> 27:16.925
I don't.
Really, I don't.

27:17.010 --> 27:21.847
Anything you do is okay
with me, but you start to
feel guilty about it,

27:21.931 --> 27:26.644
then we start having fights,
and you take it out on me.
I don't feel guilty!

27:26.728 --> 27:31.231
It's just that I'm against war
and this whole drummed-up,
superpatriotic atmosphere.

27:31.316 --> 27:35.152
You just don't
want to get shot.
Nobody wants to get shot.

27:35.236 --> 27:38.489
So stop trying
to convince yourself.

27:38.573 --> 27:40.991
Forget it.

27:41.076 --> 27:45.871
I got a sick show
on my hands!
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

27:45.955 --> 27:50.250
Look, Michael,
this is me, Margaret.

27:50.335 --> 27:52.252
I understand you.

27:53.672 --> 27:56.465
You're a heel, but you're
not that big a heel.

27:56.549 --> 27:58.425
And then, too,

27:58.510 --> 28:01.136
they fish for fish
in the river.

28:01.221 --> 28:03.722
I was told that.

28:04.766 --> 28:07.893
I like your tie.
You do?

28:09.145 --> 28:11.105
I just saw it,
and I bought it.

28:17.278 --> 28:19.363
Do you think
it's gonna rain?

28:19.447 --> 28:22.324
I like to walk in the rain.
I do to.

28:22.409 --> 28:24.451
You do?
Mm-hmm.

28:24.536 --> 28:26.995
You wanna walk?
All right.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.998
Let's walk.
Okay.

28:32.544 --> 28:35.337
What are you
gonna tell him?
Who?

28:35.422 --> 28:37.798
Michael.
Nothing.

28:37.882 --> 28:39.800
Oh.

28:43.430 --> 28:45.347
Well, maybe so.

28:47.100 --> 28:50.602
New York City
must be quite frightening
to a girl from the country.

28:50.687 --> 28:52.604
Oh, no, it isn't.

28:52.689 --> 28:55.315
The truth is it puts on
an act of sophistication,

28:55.400 --> 28:59.236
but at heart
it's strictly provincial.

28:59.320 --> 29:01.447
I don't think
it's provincial.

29:01.531 --> 29:03.991
Anyway, not after Vermont.

29:04.075 --> 29:06.660
Vermont?
Mm-hmm.

29:08.288 --> 29:11.915
New York City-- I must say--
Does have some beautiful women.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.752
Flashy, some of them.

29:14.836 --> 29:17.504
You know,
I'm told European women...

29:17.589 --> 29:20.549
are more mature emotionally.

29:20.633 --> 29:24.011
They are?
Oh.

29:24.095 --> 29:27.264
As a matter of fact,
friends of mine have told me‒

29:28.641 --> 29:32.561
Well, anyway.
What time is it?

29:32.645 --> 29:36.565
It's late.
We better be getting back.
No. I'd like to go home.

29:37.817 --> 29:41.361
Oh. Well,
I'll take you home.
Thank you.

29:41.446 --> 29:44.573
Where do you live?
Brooklyn.

29:44.657 --> 29:47.576
Brooklyn.
Mm-hmm.

30:05.053 --> 30:08.138
Well, at last.

30:08.223 --> 30:12.142
Now we take the bus.
Now we take the bus?

30:26.658 --> 30:29.576
Now what?
Now we walk.

30:37.252 --> 30:39.253
Margaret.
Yeah?

30:39.337 --> 30:41.255
Don't.
Don't what?

30:41.339 --> 30:44.758
Don't be angry with me.
Why not?

30:46.302 --> 30:48.720
You have been
very charming.

30:48.805 --> 30:50.889
You have not been
understanding.

30:50.974 --> 30:54.268
In fact, you haven't even been
conversational all evening long.

30:56.312 --> 30:59.439
I'm sorry, Margaret.
Really, I am.

30:59.524 --> 31:03.777
But lately it seems
we can't talk
without arguing.

31:03.862 --> 31:08.115
You haven't the faintest idea
what's bothering me.

31:09.951 --> 31:13.203
Honey, I'd flip
without you.

31:13.288 --> 31:16.707
You sure would.
Well, that's the truth.

31:16.791 --> 31:19.251
You're so right about me.

31:19.335 --> 31:21.295
I sure am.

31:22.881 --> 31:26.884
Look, why don't we just sit
and be quiet?
And then what?

31:28.970 --> 31:31.013
Then you kiss me.

31:38.021 --> 31:39.980
Then I kiss you.

31:49.490 --> 31:52.451
Oh, Michael,
I love you so.

31:58.791 --> 32:00.709
Are we getting warmer?

32:01.836 --> 32:06.715
You'll be happy to know
that we're here.

32:09.260 --> 32:11.678
Good night.

32:11.763 --> 32:16.183
I wanna say I'm pleased‒

32:16.267 --> 32:20.228
very pleased, I mean,
to have brought you home.

32:21.731 --> 32:23.690
Thank you.

32:24.901 --> 32:27.486
I mean,
I'm really pleased.

32:35.203 --> 32:37.704
You do that with
your other girls, not with me.

32:37.789 --> 32:40.540
Yes. No!
No, I don't.

32:41.584 --> 32:44.002
Oh, only with me?

32:44.087 --> 32:46.213
You don't understand
what I mean.

32:46.297 --> 32:49.174
I suppose you think
that you're such
an attractive young man...

32:49.258 --> 32:51.843
that any girl
would fall all over herself
to let you kiss her.

32:51.928 --> 32:54.221
Oh, God.
Never, in all my days,

32:54.305 --> 32:58.517
have I met such an opinionated,
self-centered young man.

32:58.601 --> 33:02.646
Good night,
Mr. Ackerman.
No, don't. I‒

33:02.730 --> 33:05.649
Hope.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.993
Stop that.
You'll wake everyone.

33:59.787 --> 34:01.705
How do I get back
to the city?

34:03.291 --> 34:05.250
You're lost?

34:10.214 --> 34:14.134
No one will find me
again, ever.

34:16.219 --> 34:18.429
You're a terrible fool,
aren't you?

34:23.393 --> 34:26.730
Well, you walk two blocks
to your left,

34:26.813 --> 34:30.067
and you wait for the bus‒
the one that comes
from your left-

34:30.150 --> 34:32.402
and you take it
to Eastern Parkway.

34:32.487 --> 34:35.530
Noah, are you listening
to me?

34:37.199 --> 34:39.659
I wanna say
something to you.

34:39.744 --> 34:42.286
I am not opinionated.

34:42.371 --> 34:46.750
I don't think
I have a single opinion
in the whole world.

34:46.833 --> 34:50.087
I don't know why I kissed you.
I just couldn't help it.

34:50.170 --> 34:53.672
I guess‒ I guess
I wanted to impress you.

34:54.717 --> 34:57.427
I was afraid
that if I was myself...

34:57.512 --> 35:00.472
you wouldn't
look at me twice.

35:01.682 --> 35:03.600
It's been
a very confusing night.

35:03.684 --> 35:07.479
I don't think
I've ever been through
anything so confusing.

35:07.563 --> 35:10.148
You tell me tomorrow.

35:14.028 --> 35:17.989
The bus to Eastern Parkway.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.339
Don't get lost
on the way home.

35:39.262 --> 35:43.140
Uh, the bus
to Eastern Parkway,

35:43.224 --> 35:45.183
and then‒

35:46.644 --> 35:50.355
I love you.
I love you.

35:52.984 --> 35:55.485
Good night.

35:55.570 --> 35:58.530
Thanks for taking me home.

36:44.827 --> 36:49.039
This is really boring here.
Don't be so impatient,
Christian.

36:49.123 --> 36:53.043
Wait till you see her.
A more delicious little strudel
you have never seen.

36:53.127 --> 36:57.255
Really superb,
typically French, and very--

36:59.592 --> 37:03.303
Well, I could use
a little strudel, Brandt,

37:03.387 --> 37:06.139
but we have been here‒

37:06.224 --> 37:08.808
Yeah, two hours.

37:08.893 --> 37:11.436
To be French
is to be late.
Two hours.

37:11.520 --> 37:13.772
It's part of their charm.

37:13.856 --> 37:17.234
I only hope they get here
before I'm too blind drunk
to recognize them.

37:17.318 --> 37:21.363
Françoise, please.
Of course the men are Germans,
but not all Germans are swine.

37:21.447 --> 37:23.782
No?
Oh, I promise you,
one drink.

37:23.866 --> 37:27.619
Just one drink, then we'll go.
I don't want to be seen
fraternizing with the enemy.

37:27.703 --> 37:29.621
I don't want to be beaten
by my neighbors.
Please.

37:29.705 --> 37:32.332
I would not look good
with a shaved head.

37:32.416 --> 37:35.543
Françoise, please.
Please!
Oh!

37:35.628 --> 37:37.712
All right, I'll go.

37:37.797 --> 37:41.508
But not because
of your arguments,
because I'm curious.

37:41.592 --> 37:44.219
I'd like to observe
one of these supermen.

37:44.303 --> 37:48.473
I'm a city girl.
I've never seen
a pig up close. Come on.

37:51.519 --> 37:53.478
Here they are.

37:57.566 --> 38:00.026
Ah, at last you are here.

38:00.111 --> 38:03.488
If you didn't look so pretty,
I'd give you a good spank
in a very important place.

38:03.572 --> 38:06.366
Perhaps I'd like it.
Yes, we can talk
about that later.

38:06.450 --> 38:08.576
How nice of you to come,
Françoise.

38:08.661 --> 38:12.455
May I present
Herr Leutnant Diestl.
This is Françoise.

38:12.540 --> 38:15.375
Enchanté de faire
Votre connaissance.

38:15.459 --> 38:18.878
I'm sorry, but that's
all the French I know.
Oh, that's all right.

38:18.963 --> 38:22.382
You are all the German
I know, and perhaps,
all I care to know.

38:22.466 --> 38:26.011
And this is
my little Simone.

38:26.095 --> 38:29.139
It's a pleasure, Leutnant.
I'm sorry that we're
a little late.

38:29.223 --> 38:32.642
You see, didn't I tell you
they were worth waiting for?

38:35.021 --> 38:37.355
Would you care to sit?

38:37.440 --> 38:39.357
Oh, really gallant
you are.

38:39.442 --> 38:42.569
Are you always as dashing
as that with the ladies?

38:42.653 --> 38:44.946
Yes, always,
if they are ladies.

38:45.031 --> 38:49.117
I must warn you not to be
deceived by this Aryan charm.

38:49.201 --> 38:52.829
He is the most famous
lady-killer in the Alps.
Oh, la, la.

38:54.332 --> 38:58.251
Tell me, Lieutenant.
How many French ladies
have you killed?

39:00.755 --> 39:03.965
Well, I think that I'm not
clever enough to do that.

39:04.050 --> 39:06.593
But perhaps
if I serve in France
for a little while,

39:06.677 --> 39:10.096
I could learn how
with your very kind help.

39:10.181 --> 39:14.184
But I'm confused.
I thought you came here
to teach us something‒

39:14.268 --> 39:18.772
how to be tall and blond
and clean and efficient.

39:18.856 --> 39:22.442
Perhaps if you
were not French
and I was not German,

39:22.526 --> 39:26.613
but we were
just simply Europeans,
we could learn from each other.

39:26.697 --> 39:28.782
Don't you think?

39:28.866 --> 39:32.535
United Europe, of course.
How stupid of me.

39:32.620 --> 39:36.373
You Germans have charmed
me so that I forgot that
you were all idealists.

39:36.457 --> 39:39.292
Oh, now, look,
doesn't somebody know
a good, dirty joke?

39:39.377 --> 39:41.961
Ta gueule, Françoise, je t'en prie.
Tu vas nous gâcher cette soirée.

39:45.966 --> 39:50.553
How many of us do you plan
to murder in the name
of that golden plan of yours?

39:52.306 --> 39:57.560
If there is no unification,
we will all go on murdering
each other anyhow.

39:57.645 --> 40:00.897
I know a nice
little restaurant in Montmartre.
It has a beautiful garden.

40:00.981 --> 40:02.899
We can have it all to ourselves.
Shall we go?

40:02.983 --> 40:05.443
Yeah. We can answer
all historical questions there.

40:05.528 --> 40:08.613
And we don't even
need to get arrested.
No, wait.

40:08.697 --> 40:10.949
I would like to know...

40:11.033 --> 40:15.412
how many French lives
you have personally contributed
to that Wagnerian dream.

40:15.496 --> 40:18.415
Now, look,
this is no longer funny.
Let go of me!

40:18.499 --> 40:20.417
I want an answer
from the boche.

40:20.501 --> 40:22.419
Françoise!

40:22.503 --> 40:24.963
How many Frenchmen
have you killed?

40:26.757 --> 40:28.675
I've killed no one.

40:30.761 --> 40:32.679
No one.

40:32.763 --> 40:36.850
But if I have to sacrifice
a few lives for peace,

40:36.934 --> 40:40.520
I will do it.

40:40.604 --> 40:43.857
Ja. Even if
one of them is my own.

40:47.194 --> 40:51.156
Now I have seen
a pig up close.

40:56.287 --> 40:58.413
Thank you for your wine.

40:58.497 --> 41:00.415
Complètement folle.

41:02.334 --> 41:05.628
Laisse-moi tranquille.
Tu te rends compte
de ce que tu viens de faire?

41:08.382 --> 41:10.300
Christian.

41:20.394 --> 41:23.313
Good night, Simone.
Thank you.
I am so sorry.

41:23.397 --> 41:25.982
Oh.
Really, I am.

41:26.066 --> 41:29.402
Good night, Françoise.

41:42.458 --> 41:45.084
Lieutenant.

41:45.169 --> 41:48.963
I'm sorry. I should not
have made such a scene.
No. No.

41:49.048 --> 41:50.965
Please.

41:51.050 --> 41:53.510
My husband was killed...

41:53.594 --> 41:57.347
in 1940 in Belgium.

41:57.431 --> 42:01.518
And all this talk
about sacrificing lives
in order to have peace...

42:01.602 --> 42:04.395
just doesn't
make any sense to me.

42:04.480 --> 42:08.566
The only way
to peace is to stop
killing each other.

42:10.819 --> 42:16.115
I think about this
1,000 times in a day.

42:17.910 --> 42:21.162
And I wish it would seem
so simple to me.

42:25.626 --> 42:29.295
Could I have
another glass of wine?

42:29.380 --> 42:31.381
Yes, of course.

42:46.730 --> 42:49.274
This is my house.

42:49.358 --> 42:51.609
This is where I live.

43:04.623 --> 43:07.417
I think that I will not...

43:07.501 --> 43:11.421
try to tell you how lovely...

43:11.505 --> 43:13.548
this evening was for me.

43:17.511 --> 43:22.432
But I would like so much
to see you again.

43:22.516 --> 43:25.435
You're still the conqueror,

43:26.770 --> 43:30.106
a young, golden god of war.

43:33.027 --> 43:36.446
Perhaps...

43:36.530 --> 43:38.906
when the gold has worn off
a little.

43:58.427 --> 44:00.386
Good night.

44:22.409 --> 44:25.453
Well, that's
one of the hazards you run
when you have a daughter.

44:25.537 --> 44:29.248
One day she's going to come
to you and say, "I love him.

44:29.333 --> 44:31.376
I want to marry him."

44:31.460 --> 44:35.004
Mm-hmm. That's one
of the hazards.

44:35.089 --> 44:38.049
But you haven't
told me anything
about this man at all.

44:39.551 --> 44:43.262
Oh, he's‒ he's gentle
and he's clever.

44:44.973 --> 44:48.976
He's not just a man,
he's a boy.

44:49.061 --> 44:50.978
And poor.

44:51.063 --> 44:53.690
And poor.

44:53.774 --> 44:58.945
He writes me a letter a day,
even when we see each other
in New York every night.

45:00.739 --> 45:02.990
And he's alone.

45:30.144 --> 45:33.062
He's Jewish, Father.

45:46.493 --> 45:48.828
Father, this is Noah.

45:50.289 --> 45:54.208
How do you do?
How do you do, sir?

45:54.293 --> 45:59.672
Well, seems to me
Mr. Ackerman and I
might have a little talk.

45:59.757 --> 46:01.924
Certainly, sir.

46:02.009 --> 46:04.218
Why don't you finish
your coffee, Hope?

46:04.303 --> 46:06.929
We won't be very long.

46:19.735 --> 46:22.528
That's Jack Marshall's.

46:22.613 --> 46:27.533
I went to school
with his father,
my father with his father.

46:28.869 --> 46:31.454
Virgil Smith's law office.

46:31.538 --> 46:34.791
One of his people
did the legal work when
they incorporated this town.

46:34.875 --> 46:37.418
1750.

46:39.129 --> 46:42.340
Well, looks like
it's gonna be a nice day.

46:46.470 --> 46:49.347
♪♪

46:58.649 --> 47:02.652
It's the family plot.
Seven generations
of Plowmans there,

47:03.737 --> 47:05.738
Hope's mother too.

47:09.076 --> 47:11.327
There's the school.

47:11.411 --> 47:13.746
Mr. Plowman, um,

47:13.831 --> 47:17.333
I don't have a family plot.

47:17.417 --> 47:19.585
I don't have a family.

47:19.670 --> 47:24.841
I earn $35 a week,
and I'm 1 -A in the draft.

47:24.925 --> 47:29.220
But I love Hope, and I shall
love her for all my life.

47:37.771 --> 47:40.189
You're doing an awful thing,

47:40.274 --> 47:43.192
putting a man to the test
of his principles.

47:43.277 --> 47:48.364
I wish to heaven you'd
turn around and get on that bus
and never see Hope again.

47:50.033 --> 47:54.036
But you won't do that,
will ya?

47:56.623 --> 47:59.917
Didn't think you would.

48:00.002 --> 48:02.837
Anybody from town asked
to marry Hope, I'd say,

48:02.921 --> 48:06.841
"Come on out to the house.
We got turkey for dinner."

48:10.929 --> 48:14.015
I never knew a Jew before.

48:14.099 --> 48:18.144
You go along all your life
thinkin' a certain way,

48:18.228 --> 48:22.607
someone jolts you, you have
to look inside yourself.

48:22.691 --> 48:26.527
That's what you've made
me do, and I'm not
fond of you for it.

48:45.631 --> 48:49.300
I was just telling Mr. Ackerman
we've got turkey for dinner.

49:01.021 --> 49:02.980
Thank you.

49:13.909 --> 49:16.827
If you don't open the door,
we are obliged to break it in.

49:16.912 --> 49:21.082
Is this headquarter's idea
of a friendly little visit
for me to photograph?

49:21.166 --> 49:23.084
Ja.

49:23.168 --> 49:26.212
Well, we can't wait
any longer.

49:27.631 --> 49:29.548
Kraus, Faber.

49:36.056 --> 49:37.974
Madame Brenner?
Yes, that's me.

49:38.058 --> 49:40.059
Where is Marcel Brenner?

49:40.143 --> 49:43.145
Oh, monsieur,
I wish I knew.

49:43.230 --> 49:46.315
The boy's 16 years old.

49:46.400 --> 49:50.236
Half of the time
we don't know where he is.
He don't come home at all.

49:53.615 --> 49:56.659
Kraus, here.
Faber.

50:05.043 --> 50:08.212
Marcel!

50:11.967 --> 50:14.844
Stop! Stop!
Take the boy downstairs.

50:14.928 --> 50:16.929
He'll be all right.

50:17.014 --> 50:19.390
He will not be hurt.

50:19.474 --> 50:24.603
Oh, monsieur.
I promise you. I give you
my word. He will not be hurt.

50:24.688 --> 50:27.857
He simply must perform
his labor duties.

50:40.287 --> 50:42.246
I am sorry.

50:50.547 --> 50:52.465
Come in.

50:57.721 --> 51:00.639
I would like to apply
for a transfer, sir.

51:03.143 --> 51:05.102
Why?

51:06.521 --> 51:09.899
I think I am not able
to do this work.

51:09.983 --> 51:13.194
You don't believe
you are suited to this work?

51:13.278 --> 51:15.529
I don't believe
in arresting children, sir.

51:24.039 --> 51:26.248
I spent four years
at Spandau,

51:26.333 --> 51:29.001
two years at the war academy.

51:29.086 --> 51:32.254
I should be in Russia,

51:32.339 --> 51:35.216
but I am here.

51:35.300 --> 51:39.386
And I will stay here
until I am ordered elsewhere.

51:40.180 --> 51:42.139
And so will you.

51:43.809 --> 51:48.104
What time does your train
leave for Berlin?

51:48.188 --> 51:50.147
Ja.
Uh, 12:30, sir.

51:55.737 --> 51:57.780
Here are
your furlough papers.

52:02.035 --> 52:05.412
I wish you to do me a favor
while you are in Berlin.

52:08.834 --> 52:12.378
What was that?
Oh, I don't know.
It is the Gestapo.

52:14.881 --> 52:16.882
Oberleutnant!

52:16.967 --> 52:20.761
Leutnant!
Close the door!

52:32.149 --> 52:34.150
Do you know where you are?

52:34.234 --> 52:36.652
Do you know who you are?

52:36.736 --> 52:38.696
Answer me!

52:38.780 --> 52:40.906
Yes, sir.

52:43.910 --> 52:47.037
Then stop being a child!

52:47.122 --> 52:51.125
Don't you know that when you
became a soldier, you contracted
for killing in all its forms?

52:53.879 --> 52:55.921
I do not think it possible
to remake this world...

52:56.006 --> 52:58.841
from the basement of
a dirty little police station.

52:58.925 --> 53:02.845
It doesn't matter
what you believe.

53:02.929 --> 53:07.850
Under battle conditions,
I could shoot you
for what you have just done.

53:10.103 --> 53:12.313
And I would.

53:15.233 --> 53:18.360
The German Army is invincible
because it is an army...

53:18.445 --> 53:21.280
that obeys orders,

53:21.364 --> 53:24.867
any order,
no matter how distasteful.

53:24.951 --> 53:27.620
I cannot believe‒
Be quiet.

53:28.788 --> 53:30.831
It has no sentimentalists,

53:30.916 --> 53:34.793
no moralists,
no individualists.

53:34.878 --> 53:38.881
You will have no future in it
if you don't understand that.

53:38.965 --> 53:41.634
You may have no future at all
if you oppose it.

53:41.718 --> 53:45.429
I trouble to tell you this
because you have a fine record.

53:45.513 --> 53:47.723
You will be
a creative soldier...

53:47.807 --> 53:51.769
once you get all this
thinking knocked out of you.

53:51.853 --> 53:55.564
Well, we will forget it
for the present.

53:55.649 --> 53:58.525
Now, as I was saying,
I would like you
to do me a favor.

53:58.610 --> 54:01.403
I have secured
a piece of lace.

54:03.240 --> 54:06.283
Very beautiful.
Black.

54:06.368 --> 54:08.869
For my wife.

54:08.954 --> 54:12.081
I'd hoped to give it
to her in person,

54:12.165 --> 54:14.667
but I'm too important here.

54:14.751 --> 54:19.296
And since I can't,
I would like you to deliver
it to her in Berlin.

54:22.008 --> 54:23.926
Yes, sir.

54:24.010 --> 54:26.345
Give her
my most tender regards.

54:26.429 --> 54:29.515
You may say that
I think of her constantly.

54:29.599 --> 54:31.934
The address is on the package.

54:32.018 --> 54:34.311
Enjoy your leave!

55:00.088 --> 55:03.299
Coming.

55:03.383 --> 55:06.552
Coming.

55:13.476 --> 55:15.394
Uh, Mrs. Hardenburg, please.

55:15.478 --> 55:20.065
Yes?
I am Lieutenant Diestl
from your husband's company,

55:20.150 --> 55:24.403
and this is a gift
from Captain Hardenburg.

55:24.487 --> 55:28.240
Well, come in.

55:34.205 --> 55:38.000
Oh, yes, of course.
You're the serious one...

55:38.084 --> 55:41.003
in the photograph
with the captain.

55:41.087 --> 55:43.172
Oh, yes,
in front of the church?
Yes.

55:43.256 --> 55:45.174
Yes.

55:45.258 --> 55:48.218
How do you do?
It's a pleasure.

55:49.596 --> 55:52.765
He wrote me
you were coming to Berlin.

55:52.849 --> 55:56.477
If there was anything
I could do for you and so forth.

55:56.561 --> 55:59.355
Well, that's very kind
of the captain.

55:59.439 --> 56:01.357
Please, sit down.

56:01.441 --> 56:03.400
Thank you.

56:05.612 --> 56:08.072
Make yourself comfortable.

56:08.990 --> 56:11.533
What would you like
to drink?

56:11.618 --> 56:16.038
Perhaps I am
intruding here. You were
just going out, no?

56:16.122 --> 56:20.334
Only with a general.
I'll tell him I kept him waiting
for a lieutenant.

56:20.418 --> 56:22.878
Well, in that case, I‒

56:22.962 --> 56:25.047
Vodka?
Yes, wonderful.

56:25.131 --> 56:27.091
I have some direct
from the Ukraine.

56:33.598 --> 56:35.516
And how is the captain?

56:39.187 --> 56:43.357
Uh, he's fine.
He asked me to give you
his tenderest regards,

56:43.441 --> 56:46.652
and to tell you that
he thinks of you constantly.

56:46.736 --> 56:50.114
That's very thoughtful of him.

56:50.198 --> 56:52.157
Thank you.

56:54.411 --> 56:57.913
And, uh,
how is gay Paris?

56:57.997 --> 57:01.458
Well, gay Paris is
not so gay.

57:01.543 --> 57:03.836
Oh, that's too bad.

57:03.920 --> 57:06.672
Where are you staying?

57:08.550 --> 57:11.468
As a matter of fact,
I have no accommodations.
I was‒

57:11.553 --> 57:14.096
You'll find it impossible
to get a hotel room.

57:14.180 --> 57:18.600
Maybe I can do something
for you at the Adelon Hotel.
Oh, that would be wonderful.

57:18.685 --> 57:20.602
Thank you.
Excuse me.

57:20.687 --> 57:22.646
Of course.

57:27.110 --> 57:30.028
All right, Franz.
Tell him I'll be right down.

57:33.199 --> 57:35.367
Are you in a hurry
to get someplace?

57:36.661 --> 57:39.580
Uh, no.

57:39.664 --> 57:43.292
Then stay.
I won't be too long.

57:43.376 --> 57:45.752
And I want to talk to you
about the captain.

57:45.837 --> 57:47.754
Will you?

57:49.215 --> 57:51.133
Yes.

57:51.217 --> 57:53.218
Wonderful.

57:53.303 --> 57:57.222
Have another drink, Lieutenant.
Take some caviar.

57:57.307 --> 58:00.392
See how
the home front suffers.

58:00.477 --> 58:03.061
Au reVoir.
Au reVoir.

58:58.618 --> 59:03.580
I'm sorry.
No, no.
Don't disturb yourself.

59:20.890 --> 59:23.183
I hope you were not
too bored.

59:23.268 --> 59:26.603
No. I wasn't
bored at all.

59:26.688 --> 59:31.984
As a matter of fact,
I found a wonderful companion.

59:33.069 --> 59:36.238
Aren't you going
to offer me a drink?

59:36.322 --> 59:39.241
Oh, sure.

59:39.325 --> 59:42.244
I offer you a drink.

59:43.538 --> 59:46.164
Oh, that's too much.

59:49.502 --> 59:51.420
Enough.

01:00:05.351 --> 01:00:09.479
It couldn't have been
a very interesting evening
for a soldier on leave.

01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:14.192
Well, I am, uh‒

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:20.073
I'm not a soldier.
I'm a...

01:00:20.158 --> 01:00:22.117
policeman.

01:00:22.201 --> 01:00:25.037
And you don't
find this interesting?

01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:29.249
Uh-uh.

01:00:30.418 --> 01:00:33.378
Well, cheer up.

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:36.006
Things may be different.

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:40.052
I have a friend
on Rommel's staff.

01:00:40.136 --> 01:00:43.639
Maybe he can be helpful.

01:00:43.723 --> 01:00:46.350
Wait.

01:00:46.434 --> 01:00:48.727
You‒ You can do this?

01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:52.522
You can arrange
military transfers?

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:58.570
With a small effort.

Morning.

I hear your show's

It's a lulu.

Brandy and soda.
Sì, signore.

01:03:34.852 --> 01:03:37.771
Can you spare it?

What's the matter?
Nothing.

01:03:40.983 --> 01:03:45.195
Oh, come on, Michael.
You can usually fake an
affectionate kiss at lunchtime.

01:03:45.279 --> 01:03:48.532
Something fell through
in Washington, and I
have to take basic training.

01:03:48.616 --> 01:03:50.867
Oh. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

I'm sorry.
Now that's better.

01:03:57.625 --> 01:04:00.794
Why don't you take
the afternoon off?
Oh, I can't, Michael.

01:04:00.878 --> 01:04:05.215
The Office of War Information
can spare you on
my last afternoon.

01:04:05.299 --> 01:04:09.177
We'll see each other tonight.
Tell 'em you're involved
in a troop movement.

01:04:09.262 --> 01:04:11.346
No, Michael.
I can't.

01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:13.765
On the house.
This is the last of the cognac.

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:17.185
I bet they still have
plenty in Italy.

01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:19.855
I came here in 1924, sir.

01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:23.233
I don't know anything
about Italy anymore.

01:04:23.317 --> 01:04:26.778
That was pretty unnecessary.
Not the way I feel.

01:04:29.407 --> 01:04:32.659
Margaret, what do
you want from me?

01:04:32.743 --> 01:04:35.078
I want you
to act like a man.

01:04:37.373 --> 01:04:41.877
I want to be proud
of you, the way Hope
is proud of Noah.

01:04:41.961 --> 01:04:44.546
You want me to get shot.
Look, I've read all the books.

01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:48.091
I know that in 10 years
we'll be bosom friends
with the Germans and Japanese.

01:04:48.175 --> 01:04:50.302
Then I'll be pretty annoyed
that I was killed.

01:04:51.345 --> 01:04:56.182
Look, Michael, I don't
want you to get shot!

01:04:56.267 --> 01:05:00.520
I don't-- I don't even
mind your wanting
to get out of the army.

01:05:00.605 --> 01:05:04.566
I just want you
to stop pretending
that you think it's all right.

01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:07.402
Is that all?
No.

01:05:09.989 --> 01:05:12.908
I want us to go someplace
and get married.

01:05:12.992 --> 01:05:17.078
Now?
Mm-hmm.

01:05:17.163 --> 01:05:20.457
Look, honey, I love you,
but today?

01:05:20.541 --> 01:05:22.709
Now you've been seeing
too many war pictures.

01:05:24.337 --> 01:05:28.173
You mean no?
I could be in for years.

01:05:30.468 --> 01:05:35.388
Last chance, Michael.
Oh, honey,
that'd be foolish.

01:05:39.477 --> 01:05:43.688
Oh, I almost forgot.

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:47.317
The office is
sending me overseas.

01:05:47.401 --> 01:05:50.528
I was gonna
tell you that tonight.

Oh, hello, Mrs. Ackerman,
Mr. Ackerman.
Hello.

Rather early this morning,

Yes, we are.

01:06:13.386 --> 01:06:16.846
Well, today's the day, eh?
Yes, it is.

01:06:16.931 --> 01:06:21.309
Here. Give you courage.
Calm the nerves.

01:06:21.394 --> 01:06:23.353
Go ahead. Drink it.

01:06:23.437 --> 01:06:26.815
It's full of cream.
Homogenized.

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:31.736
Good, isn't it?
Yes, it is.

01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:35.073
I drink two quarts
a day myself.
Keeps me young.

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:37.742
Well, I've got to be
on my way. Good luck.

All right, Leutnant.

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:03.720
Now.
May I suggest
we wait, sir?

01:09:03.805 --> 01:09:05.807
Wait? Why?

01:09:05.890 --> 01:09:09.894
Over your shoulder, sir.
The sun will be up
in a few moments.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:12.479
And when the sun is up
and in their eyes,

01:09:12.564 --> 01:09:14.816
their guns will be
completely useless.

01:09:22.198 --> 01:09:26.243

What are you doing,
Oberleutnant?

01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:26.799

Nope.

01:20:44.714 --> 01:20:49.093
What language do they speak?
Language?
They talk with their hands.

01:20:49.177 --> 01:20:52.221
Well, how come Ackerman speaks English?
He's a spy.

01:20:52.305 --> 01:20:54.849
Hey, wait a minute.
You guys ain't bein' fair.

01:20:54.933 --> 01:20:58.352
I feel sorry for him.
Really, I do.
Oh, sure!

01:20:58.436 --> 01:21:01.522
Look at the dough he could
be makin' sellin' black-market
tires and gasoline...

01:21:01.606 --> 01:21:04.191
if he weren't in the service.

01:21:04.276 --> 01:21:06.193
Oh, forget it.
You're right.

01:21:06.278 --> 01:21:08.404
Hey, uh, Ackerman!

01:21:08.488 --> 01:21:10.447
How come you're
in the service anyway?

01:21:10.532 --> 01:21:12.575
He had no influence with the draft board.
They were all Irish.

01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:17.913
Here. Cut. All right.
What are you bettin'?

01:21:17.998 --> 01:21:20.833
What'd you hear from Hope?

01:21:20.917 --> 01:21:24.461
Hope? She's fine
the last I‒

01:21:24.546 --> 01:21:26.463
What's the matter?

01:21:26.548 --> 01:21:29.717
Oh, now I've done it.
I've done it.

01:21:29.801 --> 01:21:32.887
Her birthday.

01:21:32.971 --> 01:21:36.223
I got $20 stashed,
and I can't even
get to a store.

01:21:36.308 --> 01:21:38.767
Maybe you can get something
at the PX.

01:21:38.852 --> 01:21:41.770
Come on.
I'll go with you.

01:21:41.855 --> 01:21:43.898
That's a good idea.

01:21:49.487 --> 01:21:51.405
My bank.

01:22:07.672 --> 01:22:10.007
Whose play is it?

01:22:10.091 --> 01:22:13.844
No.

01:22:13.929 --> 01:22:17.389
I'll lend you the 20.
Let's go.

01:22:17.474 --> 01:22:19.975
You got a pen?

01:23:11.069 --> 01:23:14.321
Noah, forget it.

01:23:14.406 --> 01:23:17.574
If I were you‒
You're not.

01:23:43.601 --> 01:23:46.937
Hey, aren't you
gonna eat?

01:23:51.776 --> 01:23:53.736
Read this.

01:24:08.877 --> 01:24:11.754
Would you act as my second?

01:24:13.423 --> 01:24:16.967
What second?
I want everything to be
absolutely correct.

01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:20.220
And I‒ I don't
trust myself to arrange it.
I might lose my temper.

01:24:20.305 --> 01:24:24.058
Are you out of your head?
These are the four biggest guys
in the company.

01:24:24.142 --> 01:24:26.769
So?

01:24:26.853 --> 01:24:28.979
What do you weigh?

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:31.774
Never mind what I weigh.

01:24:31.858 --> 01:24:33.776
A hundred and thirty-five.

01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:38.113
Look, they're only needling you
because you had them
confined to the post.

01:24:38.198 --> 01:24:41.492
Will you arrange
the schedule?

01:24:41.576 --> 01:24:44.203
Okay. You don't want
to help, don't help.

01:24:44.287 --> 01:24:46.205
What schedule?

01:24:46.289 --> 01:24:49.291
You want me to fight
all four guys in one night?

01:24:49.375 --> 01:24:51.293
You're crazy.

01:24:51.377 --> 01:24:53.712
I don't want to have
anything to do with this.
Now take it.

01:24:53.797 --> 01:24:55.714
Take it!

01:25:44.347 --> 01:25:46.306
Okay, Donnelly,
so you're a big man.

01:25:46.391 --> 01:25:48.642
Nice punch, Donnelly.
Come on.
I'll buy you a beer.

01:25:48.726 --> 01:25:51.645
What do ya know?
The little punk gave me
a bloody nose.

01:25:51.729 --> 01:25:54.565
Come on.

01:26:02.115 --> 01:26:04.283
Well, you asked for it.

01:26:04.367 --> 01:26:06.326
Teach him a little bit
about boxing. Nope.
Look out. Look out.

01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:08.829
Come on, Burnecker.
Finish 'im.

01:26:08.913 --> 01:26:10.831
Oh, oh, look.

01:26:13.585 --> 01:26:16.003
Lay it into him, Burnie.
Okay, Burnie.
Knock him on his back.

01:26:16.087 --> 01:26:19.047
Ah, don't kill 'im.
Oh, not yet anyway.
Give him a one, two.

01:26:19.132 --> 01:26:22.342
Fix it so he won't
want to fight anymore.
Come on, Burnie!

01:26:22.427 --> 01:26:24.845
Come on. Hold 'im up.
He's goin' down.
Ah, look out now.

01:26:24.929 --> 01:26:27.347
That'll teach you
to keep those windows clean.

01:26:27.432 --> 01:26:30.058
Give him that one, two,
Burnecker.

01:26:34.272 --> 01:26:37.566
Look, kid. Look.
Fall down, kid.
Fall down.

01:26:41.946 --> 01:26:43.822
Come on. Finish 'im.

01:27:23.529 --> 01:27:25.489
Yes, Whiteacre?

01:27:25.573 --> 01:27:29.618
I'm sure you're not aware of it,
Captain, but Private Ackerman
has been badly beaten...

01:27:29.702 --> 01:27:32.204
in fights with the biggest men
in the company.

01:27:33.581 --> 01:27:35.499
Yes?

01:27:35.583 --> 01:27:39.920
He's been seriously hurt,
and I'm sure now that you know,
you'll want to stop it.

01:27:41.339 --> 01:27:43.382
You're quite right,
Whiteacre.

01:27:43.466 --> 01:27:47.928
If I knew, I would stop it.
I'd be obliged to stop it.
But then, I don't know.

01:27:48.012 --> 01:27:50.055
You know now, sir.

01:27:54.435 --> 01:27:56.436
What's the matter with you?

01:27:56.521 --> 01:28:00.107
Ackerman isn't one of
those rich Broadway producers
you have to suck around.

01:28:00.191 --> 01:28:02.109
He's just a dogface.
Get some sense.

01:28:02.193 --> 01:28:05.070
I think you'll have
to stop it, sir.

01:28:11.244 --> 01:28:16.123
You know, the colonel had
a phone call about you out
of channels from Washington‒

01:28:16.207 --> 01:28:18.292
very much out of channels‒

01:28:18.376 --> 01:28:22.379
to transfer you
to special service in London.

01:28:22.463 --> 01:28:24.423
It's up to me to approve it
or disapprove it.

01:28:26.217 --> 01:28:30.137
I still think
you'll have to stop it, sir.
I know the colonel would.

01:28:34.517 --> 01:28:38.478
All right, Whiteacre.
I'll spell it out for you.

01:28:38.563 --> 01:28:41.815
You go to the colonel
and you won't get your transfer.

01:28:41.899 --> 01:28:46.737
You'll have to be fives times
more soldier than any man in
this outfit just to stay alive.

01:28:46.821 --> 01:28:48.739
Now get out.

01:28:54.412 --> 01:28:56.371
Rickett.

01:29:01.711 --> 01:29:05.339
Get rid of 'im...
today.

01:29:05.423 --> 01:29:09.259
Send his papers through.
Yes, sir.

01:29:09.344 --> 01:29:11.386
Well, I hope you're satisfied.

01:29:11.471 --> 01:29:14.931
This makes three beatings
in a row.
I almost had him though.

01:29:16.434 --> 01:29:19.019
How'd he look?
Yeah.
Who? Cowley?

01:29:19.103 --> 01:29:21.355
Better than you do.

01:29:21.439 --> 01:29:25.567
What are you
trying to prove?
Nothin'.

01:29:25.651 --> 01:29:30.405
Well, why are you tryin'
to kill yourself?
I like to fight.

01:29:30.490 --> 01:29:33.617
Well, I'm tired
of watching you get
your brains beat out.

01:29:33.701 --> 01:29:36.787
Look, if you fight Brailsford,
you're on your own.

01:29:36.871 --> 01:29:38.747
Sorry.

01:29:38.831 --> 01:29:41.500
That's okay.
That's all right.

01:29:41.584 --> 01:29:43.668
Michael,
I can lick Brailsford.

01:29:43.753 --> 01:29:45.670
Well, I don't care.

01:29:45.755 --> 01:29:48.131
It's important to me.
It's the last fight.

01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:51.176
You're crazy. This whole thing
has got you crazy.
Maybe.

01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:54.888
Oh, excuse me, men?
Yes, Lieutenant?

01:29:54.972 --> 01:29:58.266
I'd like to speak
with Ackerman.
Certainly, sir.

01:30:00.603 --> 01:30:02.479
You'll be around?

01:30:03.773 --> 01:30:06.608
Mm-hmm.

01:30:07.652 --> 01:30:09.736
Cigarette?

01:30:09.821 --> 01:30:11.738
Thanks.

01:30:14.367 --> 01:30:17.035
Oh. Sorry.

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:20.705
Ackerman, I've been
watching the sick book.

01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:26.336
In my opinion, you're the most
accident-prone soldier in the
entire United States Infantry.

01:30:26.421 --> 01:30:29.089
I'm careless, sir.

01:30:29.173 --> 01:30:31.842
Saturday nights in town
you're careless.

01:30:31.926 --> 01:30:33.844
Every Saturday night.

01:30:33.928 --> 01:30:36.596
On weekdays, you run
the roughest obstacle course
on the post...

01:30:36.681 --> 01:30:39.641
without stubbing your toe.

01:30:39.725 --> 01:30:41.643
Now why don't
you level with me?

01:30:41.727 --> 01:30:44.646
I know you're fighting.
I think I know why.

01:30:46.524 --> 01:30:49.025
This is something
for the colonel to handle.

01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:51.361
Just give me the word.

01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:56.241
Besides, you're getting licked.
You're no good to us
punch-drunk.

01:30:56.325 --> 01:30:59.578
I appreciate it, Lieutenant.
Thank you.

01:30:59.662 --> 01:31:01.746
But this is my business.

01:31:01.831 --> 01:31:05.125
Whiteacre?
Yeah?

01:31:05.209 --> 01:31:08.670
I've been looking
all over the post for you.
Your orders just came through.

01:31:08.754 --> 01:31:11.339
You've got 40 minutes
to make the train to Washington.

01:31:11.424 --> 01:31:13.383
Thanks.

01:31:18.264 --> 01:31:20.223
He's all yours, medic.

01:32:33.881 --> 01:32:37.634
Don't fall! Don't fall!
Don't fall! Don't fall!

01:32:37.718 --> 01:32:39.636
Don't fall!

01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:03.201
Come on.

01:33:24.515 --> 01:33:26.766
Now leave it alone.

01:33:26.851 --> 01:33:29.311
You'll get dirt in it.

01:33:33.566 --> 01:33:35.609
Ready! Hut!

01:33:35.693 --> 01:33:37.652
Ready! Hut!

01:33:37.737 --> 01:33:39.654
Ready! Hut!

01:33:39.739 --> 01:33:41.865
Attention roll call!

01:33:41.949 --> 01:33:43.867
- Abbott?
- Here!

01:33:43.951 --> 01:33:45.869
- Acaro?
- Here!

01:33:45.953 --> 01:33:48.413
Ackerman?

01:33:48.497 --> 01:33:50.373
Ackerman!

01:33:53.294 --> 01:33:55.754
Any of you men
seen Ackerman?

01:34:04.221 --> 01:34:08.433
Abbott, did Ackerman sleep
in his bunk last night?

01:34:08.517 --> 01:34:11.061
I don't know, sir.
I didn't notice.

01:34:17.401 --> 01:34:19.486
Donnelly, did he?

01:34:19.570 --> 01:34:21.655
Eyes front, you.

01:34:21.739 --> 01:34:24.324
Well, Donnelly?

01:34:24.408 --> 01:34:27.577
I don't know, sir.
He's at the opposite end
of the barracks.

01:34:29.705 --> 01:34:31.623
I warn you, men.

01:34:31.707 --> 01:34:35.627
I want a straight answer
from the next soldier. Cowley!

01:34:38.547 --> 01:34:41.383
No, sir.
He didn't.

01:34:43.094 --> 01:34:46.554
Nobody deserts this company!

01:34:48.724 --> 01:34:50.850
When they find 'im,
I don't want him in a stockade.

01:34:50.935 --> 01:34:53.353
I want him right back here.

01:34:53.437 --> 01:34:56.648
He's mine.
Yes, sir.

01:35:10.788 --> 01:35:15.166
Gentlemen,
your attention please!

01:35:15.251 --> 01:35:18.002
The briefing will begin.

01:35:25.136 --> 01:35:27.220
Gentlemen.

01:35:27.304 --> 01:35:30.014
I will come directly
and frankly to the point.

01:35:30.099 --> 01:35:34.436
You have heard rumors that
our position is deteriorating.

01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:36.438
It is.

01:35:36.522 --> 01:35:39.023
An American invasion fleet
of tremendous strength...

01:35:39.108 --> 01:35:43.486
is believed to be
approaching Tunisia
to attack us from the rear.

01:35:43.571 --> 01:35:47.532
The British are about to launch
a massive frontal offensive.

01:35:47.616 --> 01:35:49.534
The resistance at Stalingrad...

01:35:49.618 --> 01:35:54.289
has bled off
fuel and ammunition
in unexpected quantities.

01:35:54.373 --> 01:35:58.334
We must, therefore,
prepare for a breakthrough.

01:36:01.172 --> 01:36:04.758
For the present, this
information is for you only.

01:36:04.842 --> 01:36:06.968
Air attack!

01:36:07.052 --> 01:36:09.095
Dismissed.

01:36:50.054 --> 01:36:51.930
♪♪

01:38:05.296 --> 01:38:08.298
Damn you!
Keep awake!
I am awake.

01:38:08.382 --> 01:38:12.468
Well, you stay that way!
Talk to me!

01:38:12.553 --> 01:38:15.221
See that you don't
fall asleep!

01:38:17.266 --> 01:38:23.062
What do you want me to say?
Anything. Anything.
Just talk.

01:38:23.147 --> 01:38:25.523
All right.

01:38:25.608 --> 01:38:29.152
How far‒ How far do
we have to go now?

01:38:30.195 --> 01:38:33.865
About 400 kilometers more.

01:38:35.326 --> 01:38:37.702
Seven hours!

01:38:43.208 --> 01:38:46.210
I think I must sleep.

01:38:46.295 --> 01:38:49.714
If you sleep,
you'll wake up
in a British prison camp.

01:38:49.798 --> 01:38:53.509
Come on! Talk!

01:38:53.594 --> 01:38:56.971
I wish I was
in the mountains...

01:38:57.056 --> 01:39:01.434
where it's so cool
and peaceful in the snow,

01:39:01.518 --> 01:39:04.604
so wonderful to feel
the wind in your face,

01:39:04.688 --> 01:39:07.607
clean and nice.

01:39:07.691 --> 01:39:10.985
And I like the smell
of smoke in the winter...

01:39:11.070 --> 01:39:14.989
coming from the wood...
in the fireplaces.

01:39:15.074 --> 01:39:18.159
Talk about something else!
Talk about women!

01:39:18.243 --> 01:39:21.746
Women! Women!

01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:27.543
I have a French girl, Françoise,
and I think I can love her.

01:39:27.628 --> 01:39:31.798
Was she beautiful?
Yes, she was beautiful.

01:39:31.882 --> 01:39:34.634
And I wish I was with her...

01:39:34.718 --> 01:39:37.637
and not on this motorcycle...

01:39:37.721 --> 01:39:39.639
because I am‒

01:39:39.723 --> 01:39:42.183
I am sick of Africa!

01:39:42.267 --> 01:39:45.895
And I am sick of
the great German army.

01:39:45.980 --> 01:39:48.648
And I am sick of
doing my duty.

01:39:48.732 --> 01:39:50.900
I should have shot you.

01:39:50.985 --> 01:39:54.570
What?
I said I should have
shot you!

01:39:54.655 --> 01:39:56.823
I ought to shoot you now!

01:39:56.907 --> 01:39:59.784
You'd better learn
to drive this first.

01:39:59.868 --> 01:40:01.786
You will destroy us!

01:40:01.870 --> 01:40:04.330
Men like you
poison an army!

01:40:04.415 --> 01:40:07.000
You let discipline slip
a little one day...

01:40:07.084 --> 01:40:10.336
and a little more the next day
and soon you're nothing!

01:40:10.421 --> 01:40:13.840
You are not able
to fight at all!
I should have shot you!

01:40:13.924 --> 01:40:16.843
Why didn't you shoot me then?
Because I was an idiot!

01:40:16.927 --> 01:40:20.346
Yes!
You recognize it! Ja.

01:40:20.431 --> 01:40:24.267
You are still infected with
a little decent human feelings!

01:40:24.351 --> 01:40:27.186
Oh, shut up! Shut up!
And you hate that in yourself,
don't you?

01:40:27.271 --> 01:40:30.231
Shut up!
You hate it in yourself-

01:41:20.532 --> 01:41:22.492
What?

01:41:24.161 --> 01:41:26.245
Hello.

01:41:30.751 --> 01:41:33.336
I want to kiss you.

01:41:37.341 --> 01:41:39.675
Why didn't you tell me?

01:41:42.179 --> 01:41:44.263
I couldn't.

01:41:44.348 --> 01:41:48.601
Besides, there is a law against
harboring deserters.

01:41:48.685 --> 01:41:50.937
You're not a deserter.

01:41:51.021 --> 01:41:54.023
The army knows you told me
you gave yourself up.

01:41:57.694 --> 01:42:00.321
You all right?

01:42:00.405 --> 01:42:02.365
Yes.

01:42:04.701 --> 01:42:07.703
Noah,

01:42:07.788 --> 01:42:12.083
you know what
they're asking me to do?

01:42:12.167 --> 01:42:14.085
Sure. Sure.

01:42:16.505 --> 01:42:21.050
The lawyer says
if you go back
to your own company,

01:42:21.135 --> 01:42:23.553
you won't go to prison.

01:42:24.596 --> 01:42:26.556
Mm-hmm.

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:31.185
I'm not trying
to tell you what to do.
You do what you have to.

01:42:35.691 --> 01:42:38.651
Hope, stand up.

01:42:40.904 --> 01:42:42.864
Stand up.

01:42:49.371 --> 01:42:52.707
Honey,
how long is it?

01:42:52.791 --> 01:42:55.418
What?
How long is it?

01:42:55.502 --> 01:42:58.588
Five months.
Five months!

01:42:58.672 --> 01:43:00.965
Why didn't you tell me?

01:43:01.049 --> 01:43:03.426
I could've written you,
I guess.

01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:07.346
I had to work
this out myself.

01:43:07.431 --> 01:43:10.516
The doctor said I should stay
in bed for a while.

01:43:10.601 --> 01:43:12.852
I did.

01:43:12.936 --> 01:43:16.105
I guess that's why
I didn't write to you.

01:43:17.691 --> 01:43:21.110
I wanted to make sure
it would be all right.

01:43:23.572 --> 01:43:26.616
I don't want this
to influence you
one way or the other.

01:43:29.161 --> 01:43:32.121
Are you glad?

01:43:34.708 --> 01:43:37.376
It's wonderful.

01:43:37.461 --> 01:43:40.129
Absolutely... wonderful.

01:43:40.214 --> 01:43:42.131
Time's up.

01:43:42.216 --> 01:43:45.301
Don't worry about me.
I'm going back home.

01:43:45.385 --> 01:43:47.303
Don't worry at all.

01:43:49.223 --> 01:43:51.307
I'm not worried.

01:43:53.977 --> 01:43:56.479
Can you imagine?

01:43:57.940 --> 01:44:01.025
Listen.
Go to the lawyer,

01:44:01.109 --> 01:44:05.279
and tell him I'll go
anyplace they want to send me.

01:44:05.364 --> 01:44:07.657
All right, soldier.
'Kay?

01:44:13.330 --> 01:44:16.832
I love you.

01:44:28.804 --> 01:44:30.721
Not only are you a disgrace
to the army, Ackerman,

01:44:30.806 --> 01:44:33.057
but your actions have caused
a black mark to be made
against this company...

01:44:33.141 --> 01:44:35.768
and against me personally.

01:44:35.852 --> 01:44:38.813
I'm gonna see that
you erase that black mark.

01:44:38.897 --> 01:44:42.733
I'm gonna make a soldier
out of you if I have to
break you in half to do it.

01:44:42.818 --> 01:44:45.278
Yes, sir.

01:44:45.362 --> 01:44:47.280
You'll get no passes.

01:44:47.364 --> 01:44:50.533
You'll be on KP
every day for the next week.

01:44:51.952 --> 01:44:54.912
Also you'll have the same cot
and the same men around you.

01:44:54.997 --> 01:44:59.125
You're going to have to make
mighty sure any punishments
handed out to them...

01:44:59.209 --> 01:45:01.919
aren't caused by you.
Yes, sir.

01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:07.300
Now get out of here.
I don't want to see you
in this orderly room again.

01:45:07.384 --> 01:45:10.970
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

01:45:20.147 --> 01:45:22.440
Captain?
Yes?

01:45:22.524 --> 01:45:26.569
This is Major Price.
The colonel requests that
you report to his office.

01:45:26.653 --> 01:45:29.155
I'll be right there, Major.

01:45:39.249 --> 01:45:41.250
You wish to see me, sir.

01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:48.799
There are many kinds of officers
that we get in a war,

01:45:48.884 --> 01:45:52.345
men like Green, Emerson...

01:45:52.429 --> 01:45:54.347
and a few officers like you.

01:45:54.431 --> 01:45:59.977
Fortunately,
a very few like you.

01:46:00.062 --> 01:46:03.606
Sometimes we find you out.
Occasionally we don't.

01:46:03.690 --> 01:46:07.693
In your case,
we've been lucky.

01:46:07.778 --> 01:46:09.779
I've just completed
an investigation...

01:46:09.863 --> 01:46:13.616
of the reasons
for Private Ackerman's behavior.

01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:17.453
- Sir, I can explain.
You see‒
- I hope you can.

01:46:18.997 --> 01:46:20.915
I'll read you the charges
that'll be brought
against you...

01:46:20.999 --> 01:46:24.251
at your court-martial.

01:46:24.336 --> 01:46:27.463
"That said officer
willfully persecuted
Private Noah Ackerman...

01:46:27.547 --> 01:46:31.675
by ordering mass punishment
of his entire company
as a means of disciplining him,

01:46:33.303 --> 01:46:36.138
by willfully and knowingly
permitting savage beatings...

01:46:36.223 --> 01:46:40.059
to be inflicted upon him
by members of his company,

01:46:40.143 --> 01:46:45.022
by attempting to blackmail
Private Michael Whiteacre
who interceded in his behalf."

01:46:47.484 --> 01:46:49.443
You want me to go on?

01:46:51.863 --> 01:46:53.906
I thought not.

01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:57.535
I've proffered these charges
against you, and...

01:46:57.619 --> 01:47:00.496
I officially serve you
with them now.

01:47:07.462 --> 01:47:09.380
Ah, just put your money in.
Never mind the‒

01:47:09.464 --> 01:47:11.924
How much? Five bucks.

01:47:12.008 --> 01:47:15.845
Hey! Hey, you guys.
I think I just seen a ghost.

01:47:18.181 --> 01:47:20.182
I don't see anything.

01:47:20.267 --> 01:47:22.309
- I think it's Ackerman.
- You're crazy.

01:47:22.394 --> 01:47:24.311
Ackerman's in New York
living it up.

01:47:24.396 --> 01:47:26.439
If it isn't
Ackerman, it's somebody
who looks like Ackerman.

01:47:26.523 --> 01:47:30.317
Nobody looks like Ackerman.

01:48:05.729 --> 01:48:08.564
All right. Don't just sit there.
Make room for one more.

01:48:08.648 --> 01:48:11.650
I've just found a pigeon
with 20 bucks.

01:48:11.735 --> 01:48:14.862
- Okay. Come on. Who's bettin'?
- King and queen.

01:48:14.946 --> 01:48:16.947
Five.
You're out of your mind.

01:48:33.006 --> 01:48:35.925
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon, Captain.
May I help you?

01:48:36.009 --> 01:48:39.386
Yes, uh, do you have
a Captain Hardenburg
in this section?

01:48:39.471 --> 01:48:42.890
Yes, he's here.
Would it be possible
to see him?

01:48:42.974 --> 01:48:45.768
Are you a friend of his?
Mmm. Yes.

01:48:45.852 --> 01:48:48.103
Very good.
He's right in there.
Go right in.

01:48:48.188 --> 01:48:50.105
Thank you.

01:49:03.370 --> 01:49:05.412
Captain Hardenburg?

01:49:05.497 --> 01:49:09.208
Is that you, Diestl?
Yes, sir.

01:49:09.292 --> 01:49:11.835
I was just released
from my hospital this afternoon,

01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:14.296
and I came to say good-bye.

01:49:14.381 --> 01:49:16.882
That's very nice of you.

01:49:16.967 --> 01:49:19.552
Well, are you feeling
any better, sir?

01:49:19.636 --> 01:49:24.515
Ah, better each day.
Good.

01:49:24.599 --> 01:49:28.102
But they tell me
I will be here for six months.

01:49:28.186 --> 01:49:31.397
Six months.
Ah, well, I'm sorry that
it will be so long for you.

01:49:31.481 --> 01:49:33.607
Oh, why sorry?

01:49:33.692 --> 01:49:38.195
It gives me the opportunity
to think of the future.

01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:42.658
I plan to go into politics.
Oh, yes.

01:49:42.742 --> 01:49:48.581
My face will be a reminder
of what I have given
for the fatherland.

01:49:48.665 --> 01:49:51.166
It will stand me
in good stead...

01:49:51.251 --> 01:49:54.211
before audiences
at public meetings.

01:49:54.296 --> 01:49:57.298
Well,

01:49:57.382 --> 01:49:59.592
you know, sir, that...

01:49:59.676 --> 01:50:02.344
they do remarkable things
nowadays with‒

01:50:02.429 --> 01:50:06.098
Yes, remarkable.
Remarkable.

01:50:06.182 --> 01:50:10.185
Glass eyes,
plastic noses,

01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:14.189
reconstructed cheekbones.

01:50:14.274 --> 01:50:17.610
I have written to Gretchen
in this kind of detail...

01:50:17.694 --> 01:50:20.821
to prepare her for it.

01:50:20.905 --> 01:50:24.325
And she has assured me
she is proud of me,

01:50:24.409 --> 01:50:27.536
and it will
make no difference.

01:50:27.621 --> 01:50:30.372
Gretchen is
the name of my wife.

01:50:30.457 --> 01:50:33.042
Yes, I know.

01:50:33.126 --> 01:50:35.794
How do you know?

01:50:37.797 --> 01:50:41.467
Oh, yes. You delivered
a package for me.

01:50:42.719 --> 01:50:46.138
She's quite handsome,
isn't she?

01:50:46.222 --> 01:50:49.433
Yes, sir.
She's quite handsome.

01:50:49.517 --> 01:50:51.435
She will be very useful
to my career.

01:50:53.396 --> 01:50:56.148
What I would like
for you to do for me is...

01:50:56.232 --> 01:51:00.569
visit her again...
to reassure her.

01:51:02.656 --> 01:51:05.658
I know it's
a great deal to ask,

01:51:05.742 --> 01:51:10.829
to speak
for a man to his wife
under these circumstances,

01:51:10.914 --> 01:51:15.167
but I want her to hear
from a third party that I am...

01:51:15.251 --> 01:51:17.211
salvageable.

01:51:19.631 --> 01:51:22.341
Yes, I-I-I will be
glad to do that.

01:51:22.425 --> 01:51:26.053
Thank you.
Thank you, Diestl.

01:51:27.639 --> 01:51:31.433
Now, come closer.

01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:38.899
Yes, sir.

01:51:40.443 --> 01:51:42.903
Are we alone?

01:51:45.198 --> 01:51:48.492
Yes, except for--
Yes, it's all right.

01:51:49.828 --> 01:51:53.247
I have one more favor
to ask of you.

01:51:53.331 --> 01:51:56.458
I want you to bring me
a bayonet.

01:51:58.169 --> 01:52:01.964
A bayonet?
Yes, yes.
A bayonet.

01:52:04.801 --> 01:52:08.053
Well, I think, uh‒
Wh-What is the matter
with you?

01:52:08.138 --> 01:52:10.264
Not for me.

01:52:10.348 --> 01:52:12.307
For him.

01:52:14.185 --> 01:52:17.563
He has no hands left...
or anything left.

01:52:17.647 --> 01:52:19.565
He wants to die.

01:52:19.649 --> 01:52:22.443
I've promised him.

01:52:22.527 --> 01:52:26.238
He whispers to me...
when we are alone.

01:52:26.322 --> 01:52:28.240
And he can hear.

01:52:32.912 --> 01:52:36.165
He's a watchmaker...
in Nuremberg.

01:52:36.249 --> 01:52:38.751
He specializes
in stopwatches.

01:52:38.835 --> 01:52:42.755
He has three children,
and he wants to die.

01:53:00.523 --> 01:53:04.109
Where is my hand?

01:53:04.194 --> 01:53:07.154
Approximately over his heart.

01:53:07.238 --> 01:53:09.239
Good.

01:53:09.324 --> 01:53:12.534
That's where I will place
the bayonet.

01:53:12.619 --> 01:53:16.997
We have practiced it
every night for a week.

01:53:17.081 --> 01:53:19.708
Come back tonight
with the bayonet.

01:53:32.847 --> 01:53:36.683
Diestl, will you bring me
the bayonet?

01:53:38.645 --> 01:53:40.562
Yes, sir.

01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:47.402
Good-bye, Diestl.

01:53:55.078 --> 01:53:57.454
Good-bye, sir.

01:55:41.267 --> 01:55:45.145
Yes?
It's Christian Diestl.

01:55:46.773 --> 01:55:49.358
Who?

01:55:49.442 --> 01:55:52.361
Christian Diestl.

01:55:58.534 --> 01:56:02.996
Hello?
Oh, the lieutenant.

01:56:03.081 --> 01:56:05.916
Yes.
Come in.

01:56:11.381 --> 01:56:13.840
How are you?

01:56:13.925 --> 01:56:17.469
I'm all right.
And you?

01:56:17.553 --> 01:56:19.471
Forgive me, Lieutenant.
I must look awful,

01:56:19.555 --> 01:56:21.682
but I haven't slept
for so many weeks.

01:56:21.766 --> 01:56:24.643
We've had so many air raids.
Mmm.

01:56:26.145 --> 01:56:29.314
Come in.
Excuse me.

01:56:29.399 --> 01:56:32.150
They come over
two or three times a night.

01:56:32.235 --> 01:56:34.987
You can't imagine
what it's like.

01:56:35.071 --> 01:56:37.990
The soldiers
at the front would strike
under such conditions.

01:56:39.409 --> 01:56:41.326
I mean it.

01:56:41.411 --> 01:56:43.829
There's no heat,
no light.

01:56:52.505 --> 01:56:56.341
Oh, yes.
I remember.

01:56:56.426 --> 01:56:58.927
Sit down.

01:56:59.012 --> 01:57:00.929
Thank you.

01:57:06.936 --> 01:57:08.895
Did you bring any food
from Russia?

01:57:11.190 --> 01:57:13.316
Africa.
Of course.

01:57:13.401 --> 01:57:15.610
My husband's company.
Yeah.

01:57:16.988 --> 01:57:20.365
All I have left
is some kümmel.

01:57:22.076 --> 01:57:24.453
No, thanks.

01:57:24.537 --> 01:57:27.664
Do you hear from
your husband?

01:57:29.125 --> 01:57:31.043
He killed himself.

01:57:35.631 --> 01:57:39.843
- He what?
- He killed himself
with a bayonet.

01:57:41.471 --> 01:57:43.638
I have the letter somewhere.

01:58:01.407 --> 01:58:04.034
He asked me to come here
and speak to you for him.

01:58:06.704 --> 01:58:09.331
Perhaps it's just as well.

01:58:12.168 --> 01:58:15.128
He wanted to come back here.

01:58:16.339 --> 01:58:18.340
Naturally,
I didn't encourage him.

01:58:18.424 --> 01:58:22.094
I spent a whole night
composing a most tactful letter.

01:58:22.178 --> 01:58:27.182
I told him, of course,
he would be better off in some
permanent veteran's hospital.

01:58:30.853 --> 01:58:33.063
What are you doing now?

01:58:33.147 --> 01:58:36.775
For heaven's sake, Christian,
be a little realistic.

01:58:36.859 --> 01:58:39.569
You people are getting
stranger and stranger.

01:58:43.866 --> 01:58:47.244
Stay a little while.

01:58:47.328 --> 01:58:50.539
Maybe I can find some vodka.

01:58:54.710 --> 01:58:59.339
I make myself
pretty for you.

01:59:19.485 --> 01:59:21.403
Christian?

01:59:23.239 --> 01:59:25.824
Christian!

01:59:25.908 --> 01:59:28.076
Brandt.

01:59:28.161 --> 01:59:31.246
Christian, how wonderful
to see you again.

01:59:31.330 --> 01:59:34.249
It's good to see you,
Brandt.

01:59:34.333 --> 01:59:37.002
Oh, no.
I can't believe it.

01:59:42.175 --> 01:59:44.926
Oh, it was bad, huh?

01:59:45.011 --> 01:59:49.014
No. They moved us
around a little bit,
but you know, it's‒

01:59:49.098 --> 01:59:51.016
Listen now, uh,

01:59:51.100 --> 01:59:53.602
what's the matter with you,
being so near the front?

01:59:53.686 --> 01:59:57.689
Well, you know me.
It was a mistake in the orders.

01:59:57.773 --> 01:59:59.691
But you,
what are you doing here?
Are you stationed here?

01:59:59.775 --> 02:00:04.613
No, as a matter of fact,
I'm waiting for transportation.
I'm trying to get to Paris.

02:00:04.697 --> 02:00:07.532
Let's go someplace where
we can talk. I'll buy you
a drink for old-time's sake.

02:00:07.617 --> 02:00:09.534
Brandt, I see you are
a captain from taking pictures.

02:00:09.619 --> 02:00:12.996
It's an outrage.
I should be a major.

02:00:13.080 --> 02:00:17.167
You have no idea
how glad I am to see you.

02:00:17.251 --> 02:00:20.545
I'll take that.
Bring us some glasses.

02:00:20.630 --> 02:00:24.174
I've been hanging around here
for two days waiting for
somebody to go to Paris.

02:00:24.258 --> 02:00:28.595
Listen. What are you
doing in Paris, Brandt?
Well, my headquarters are there.

02:00:28.679 --> 02:00:32.724
This is your headquarters
with the blond hair
who likes goose liver?

02:00:32.808 --> 02:00:35.769
Yeah, yeah.
That's the one.

02:00:35.853 --> 02:00:38.188
In other words,
you have no orders whatsoever.

02:00:38.272 --> 02:00:40.190
Only a desire.
Yeah, yeah.

02:00:40.274 --> 02:00:44.736
Look, Christian,
I have also managed to acquire
a little French car all my own.

02:00:44.820 --> 02:00:46.738
Well, this follows, naturally.
Yes, but look.

02:00:46.822 --> 02:00:50.575
A poor, old photographer.
I wouldn't last an hour before
somebody requisitioned it.

02:00:50.660 --> 02:00:55.705
But you have combat orders.
With you, there would be
no questions asked.

02:00:55.790 --> 02:00:57.916
You have this car here
with you?

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.585
Yeah, just near here
in a little stable.

02:01:00.670 --> 02:01:03.088
Why don't we go now?
We'll take the car.
All right. Let's go.

02:01:03.172 --> 02:01:06.132
Good. Good.

02:01:17.687 --> 02:01:21.690
Why don't you have dinner
with Simone and me
tonight, huh?

02:01:21.774 --> 02:01:25.443
Well, that would be
very nice, but I think
I must report.

02:01:25.528 --> 02:01:28.863
Oh, report in the morning.
You need some rest.

02:01:28.948 --> 02:01:31.825
Brandt, do you ever
see Françoise?

02:01:31.909 --> 02:01:35.161
Why, of course.
She is living with Simone now.

02:01:37.123 --> 02:01:39.040
She is living
with Simone?

02:01:39.125 --> 02:01:42.043
Yeah, sure. She has been
for more than a month.

02:01:44.714 --> 02:01:48.591
Brandt, would you like to
have dinner with Françoise
and me tonight?

02:01:48.676 --> 02:01:51.553
Very nice.
We'd be delighted.

02:02:18.456 --> 02:02:21.124
Simone?
Simone?

02:02:22.209 --> 02:02:24.961
Simone! Wha‒

02:02:25.046 --> 02:02:27.922
Simone. Darling.

02:02:31.218 --> 02:02:33.345
It's been forever, ja?

02:02:36.098 --> 02:02:38.975
Forever, hmm?

02:03:05.336 --> 02:03:07.253
Hello, Françoise.

02:03:09.090 --> 02:03:11.007
Hello.

02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:15.178
Come in.

02:03:20.142 --> 02:03:24.437
Oh, my wonderful friends,
I want to thank you
for this beautiful night.

02:03:24.522 --> 02:03:26.439
I love you for it.

02:03:26.524 --> 02:03:29.567
And now I'd like to make
a little toast, huh?

02:03:29.652 --> 02:03:34.072
Farewell, Captain Brandt
of the Army
of the Third Reich.

02:03:34.156 --> 02:03:36.074
You're drunk,
darling.

02:03:36.158 --> 02:03:39.786
Say good night to everyone.
No, no, no.
Christian understands me.

02:03:39.870 --> 02:03:42.455
Good night, Captain Brandt.

02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:45.500
Tomorrow you'll awaken
to your new life‒

02:03:45.584 --> 02:03:48.878
Monsieur Brandt,
citizen of the world.

02:03:48.963 --> 02:03:52.048
Isn't he funny?
He has such ideas.

02:03:52.133 --> 02:03:55.552
Sit down, Simone.
Sit down for a minute.

02:03:55.636 --> 02:03:58.263
Christian, I-I know
you don't approve,

02:03:58.347 --> 02:04:01.015
but listen to me
for a minute.

02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:03.768
Tell me‒ Are we
civilized human beings...

02:04:03.853 --> 02:04:06.896
or are we wild beasts?

02:04:06.981 --> 02:04:09.941
A human being knows
when he has lost...

02:04:10.025 --> 02:04:12.735
and he tries
to save himself.

02:04:12.820 --> 02:04:17.866
When you are put into
the army, you are expected
to risk your life.

02:04:17.950 --> 02:04:22.704
But you are not expected
to just throw it away.

02:04:22.788 --> 02:04:27.584
After all,
in any war, Christian,

02:04:27.668 --> 02:04:33.131
after all the arms
and the legs
have been blown off,

02:04:33.215 --> 02:04:35.717
it doesn't
really matter...

02:04:35.801 --> 02:04:38.803
because nothing
really changes.

02:04:43.309 --> 02:04:47.270
Good night,
my dear friend.

02:04:47.354 --> 02:04:49.272
Françoise,

02:04:52.401 --> 02:04:54.861
be good to him, ja?

02:04:55.946 --> 02:04:58.698
Because he is the best
of the best.

02:04:58.782 --> 02:05:01.618
All right, all right.
Ja.

02:05:10.503 --> 02:05:12.420
Come on.

02:05:24.099 --> 02:05:26.017
Christian.

02:05:30.731 --> 02:05:34.442
You‒ You won't report him.

02:05:45.621 --> 02:05:47.580
Thank you.

02:05:52.628 --> 02:05:54.712
You're not the same.

02:06:00.135 --> 02:06:02.303
When you are‒

02:06:02.388 --> 02:06:04.472
When you are in a hole...

02:06:06.433 --> 02:06:10.019
filled with your own excrement
for days on end,

02:06:13.315 --> 02:06:17.277
and when you see the faces
and the bodies of the men
you've killed,

02:06:19.071 --> 02:06:21.906
you change.

02:06:21.991 --> 02:06:24.200
And when you're
out there like that,

02:06:25.911 --> 02:06:29.747
when you have to live
with death every day...

02:06:29.832 --> 02:06:31.791
for so long,

02:06:33.669 --> 02:06:38.339
you have to keep something
in front of you
or you will go insane.

02:06:41.927 --> 02:06:44.554
And there were hours...

02:06:44.638 --> 02:06:50.268
I was always afraid that
I had just invented you.

02:06:50.352 --> 02:06:53.146
But I'm real.

02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:03.197
Yeah.

02:07:03.282 --> 02:07:05.199
Christian,

02:07:06.910 --> 02:07:08.828
please stay.

02:07:09.997 --> 02:07:13.166
There isn't anything
for you to fight for.

02:07:13.250 --> 02:07:16.961
There never really was.

02:07:17.046 --> 02:07:19.130
Christian,

02:07:19.214 --> 02:07:22.925
you're not the
golden warrior anymore,

02:07:23.010 --> 02:07:24.927
and soon...

02:07:26.347 --> 02:07:30.099
you will be
just another refugee.

02:07:30.184 --> 02:07:32.810
Don't throw this away.

02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:40.360
Please.

02:07:41.737 --> 02:07:44.197
Don't throw this away.

02:07:45.407 --> 02:07:47.825
I think‒

02:07:47.910 --> 02:07:50.328

I'm all right, Sam,
so far.

02:10:17.935 --> 02:10:20.895
They are a little
early tonight.

02:10:20.979 --> 02:10:25.233
Oh. Private Whiteacre,
I'd like you to meet
General Rockland.

02:10:25.317 --> 02:10:28.486
Sam, huh?
Nice to know you, sir.

02:10:28.570 --> 02:10:32.323
Thank you.
Come on over to the bar.
Bring your friend.

02:10:32.407 --> 02:10:35.493
In a little while.
Thank you, Sam.

02:10:36.787 --> 02:10:38.704
How long's this
been goin' on?

02:10:40.332 --> 02:10:43.334
Wouldn't you like to know?
And a general too.

02:10:47.756 --> 02:10:49.674
Johnny One Note.

02:10:49.758 --> 02:10:53.678
Always criticizing officers.
Always turning down promotions.

02:10:53.762 --> 02:10:57.265
Why do you insist
on staying a private?

02:11:00.435 --> 02:11:02.353
Guilt, I guess.

02:11:02.437 --> 02:11:05.064
Dr. Freud would say
I'm punishing myself...

02:11:05.148 --> 02:11:07.525
because I'm staying
out of combat.

02:11:07.609 --> 02:11:13.030
Because I'm letting Noah
Ackerman do my fighting for me,
if you wanna personalize it.

02:11:13.115 --> 02:11:15.658
Well, then get into it.

02:11:15.742 --> 02:11:18.536
Stop feeling so guilty.
It's getting a little sickening.

02:11:21.290 --> 02:11:23.416
I'd rather be guilty
than dead.

02:11:26.503 --> 02:11:28.462
Go on. See Sam.

02:11:30.257 --> 02:11:32.633
These things get any closer...

02:11:32.718 --> 02:11:35.761
I'll probably chicken out
and make a spectacle of myself.

02:11:35.846 --> 02:11:37.763
Go on! See Sam.

02:11:39.850 --> 02:11:41.809
Go on.

02:11:48.358 --> 02:11:50.860
You would, too,
wouldn't you?
Let me go.

02:11:58.243 --> 02:12:00.202
Stay here.

02:12:02.998 --> 02:12:06.584
What are you trying to do?
Get yourself killed?

02:12:11.590 --> 02:12:14.175
General, will you
do something for me?

02:12:14.259 --> 02:12:16.594
Will you?

02:12:17.638 --> 02:12:19.805
I don't know.
What is it?

02:12:19.890 --> 02:12:23.267
Can you send me back
to my old outfit?
Where are they?

02:12:23.352 --> 02:12:27.063
They're fighting in Normandy.
I suppose so.

02:12:27.147 --> 02:12:32.276
Why don't you just put in
a request through channels?
I don't wanna wait that long.

02:12:32.361 --> 02:12:34.320
All right.

02:12:36.365 --> 02:12:39.200
Give me your name
and your serial number.
Yes, sir.

02:12:44.039 --> 02:12:46.040
Thank you, General.

02:12:48.043 --> 02:12:50.044
Thank you.

02:12:52.547 --> 02:12:55.257
Well, now you've done it.

02:12:55.342 --> 02:12:58.928
You're practically
in a foxhole right now.

02:12:59.012 --> 02:13:02.515
That's what you wanted,
isn't it?
Michael, you big, stupid idiot.

02:13:02.599 --> 02:13:06.769
That isn't what I wanted.
You don't have to get killed
to keep me loving you.

02:13:08.814 --> 02:13:12.525
I won't get killed.
Believe me, I'll have
the deepest foxhole...

02:13:12.609 --> 02:13:15.236
and the biggest helmet
in the whole infantry.

02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:18.322
No, you won't.
I'll talk to him.

02:13:18.407 --> 02:13:21.534
Don't.
Margaret, please.

02:13:22.911 --> 02:13:24.996
Come here.

02:13:30.752 --> 02:13:33.796
Now let that be
a lesson to you.

02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:36.340
Margaret,
I-I have to do this.

02:13:36.425 --> 02:13:40.803
I know I'll chicken out
afterwards, but by that time
it'll be too late.

02:13:45.225 --> 02:13:48.102
I'm‒ I'm scared.

02:13:48.186 --> 02:13:51.647
Don't be scared.
I‒ I‒

02:13:51.732 --> 02:13:56.318
I'll come back.
I have to come back.
How else can I marry you?

02:14:20.802 --> 02:14:22.720
Morning, John.
Morning, Peter.

02:14:22.804 --> 02:14:24.764
Here it is.

02:14:50.707 --> 02:14:54.627
Also, the mail may be slow,
and I don't want you to worry.

02:14:54.711 --> 02:14:58.589
I can't tell you where I am,
because the censors
wouldn't like it.

02:14:58.673 --> 02:15:02.259
If it's not too private,
could you read it to us?

02:15:02.344 --> 02:15:04.261
Yeah.

02:15:06.515 --> 02:15:09.100
"The photograph was wonderful.

02:15:09.184 --> 02:15:11.852
I'm delighted
with my little girl.

02:15:11.937 --> 02:15:15.356
I can see that she
is a fine child...

02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:17.608
straight of limb,
quick of mind.

02:15:17.692 --> 02:15:21.821
I promise to return
to both of you...

02:15:21.905 --> 02:15:25.991
with a whole body
and a whole heart,
no matter what happens.

02:15:28.703 --> 02:15:32.331
I shall return to tell her
stories at bedtime,

02:15:32.415 --> 02:15:34.750
to feed her spinach...

02:15:34.835 --> 02:15:37.962
and to teach her how to
drink milk out of a glass,

02:15:40.549 --> 02:15:42.633
to take her out
in the park...

02:15:42.717 --> 02:15:45.302
and tell her the names
of the animals in the zoo,

02:15:47.639 --> 02:15:52.351
to explain to her why she
must not hit little boys...

02:15:53.812 --> 02:15:58.774
and why she must love her mother
as much as her father does."

02:16:01.236 --> 02:16:04.238
Write me.

02:16:04.322 --> 02:16:08.993
Darling, write me.
Write to me, please.

02:16:09.077 --> 02:16:12.454
Write me. Love--

02:16:12.539 --> 02:16:14.957
"Noah."

02:16:45.780 --> 02:16:48.031
They're gettin' close.

02:16:48.116 --> 02:16:52.202
Look, I want no firing
no matter what happens,
till they move up.

02:16:52.287 --> 02:16:56.999
Oh, no. No shooting.
We're only artillery
observers, ya know.

02:16:57.083 --> 02:16:59.501
I can still hear the old man.
"You boys go on up ahead.

02:16:59.585 --> 02:17:04.215
See what we have to clear out.
It's easy. Like taking a walk
on a peaceful Sunday morning."

02:17:04.299 --> 02:17:07.885
What are they doin'
out there on a peaceful
Sunday morning?

02:17:07.968 --> 02:17:10.304
Bless you.

02:17:17.812 --> 02:17:21.690
Mother. Mother.
Mother.

02:17:24.568 --> 02:17:26.486
Here they come.

02:17:26.571 --> 02:17:29.281
Put your guns on 'em
and make it count. Now!

02:17:41.503 --> 02:17:44.088
Don't bunch up down there!

02:17:46.007 --> 02:17:47.758
Grenade!

02:18:08.321 --> 02:18:11.448
There's no sense in putting
it off. We're french fried
if we stay here.

02:18:11.532 --> 02:18:15.952
Another few minutes
before they reorganize.
Who wants to go first?

02:18:16.037 --> 02:18:18.289
We'll leave
by twos and threes.

02:18:18.373 --> 02:18:21.416
We'll dissolve the detail
in twos and threes.

02:18:21.501 --> 02:18:24.128
No need to tell you
to be careful.
Who's goin' first?

02:18:31.218 --> 02:18:33.721
Look, when you get
through the Germans‒

02:18:33.805 --> 02:18:36.807
I wish I could tell you
where our lines are.

02:18:36.891 --> 02:18:41.312
But don't expose yourself
till it's absolutely necessary.

02:18:41.396 --> 02:18:44.565
You don't want to get shot
by your own men.

02:18:44.648 --> 02:18:46.608
Somebody had better go now.

02:18:51.948 --> 02:18:55.159
- All right.
- Yeah.

02:18:56.911 --> 02:18:58.912
I'll go too.

02:19:30.653 --> 02:19:33.447
What's the matter?

02:19:41.956 --> 02:19:44.583
It's all right.
It's all right.

02:19:44.666 --> 02:19:46.584
Okay?

02:20:29.504 --> 02:20:33.132
What are you doin'?
What do you mean?
Get your stuff off.

02:20:33.216 --> 02:20:35.717
Oh, no, not me.
I can't swim.
Well, I can't swim either.

02:20:35.802 --> 02:20:39.138
It can't be too deep.
There's krauts
all around us!

02:20:39.222 --> 02:20:41.223
Big deal. We'll sit
here and wait for 'em.

02:20:41.307 --> 02:20:44.226
Those are our guys across there.
They're not gonna ask
any questions.

02:20:44.310 --> 02:20:46.395
The minute we hit that
water, they're gonna spray
us like sittin' ducks.

02:20:46.479 --> 02:20:49.773
Get out of your gear!
I'm takin' off nothin'!
I've had enough of this!

02:20:49.858 --> 02:20:51.775
Cowley, you can't--
I've had enough of you.

02:20:51.860 --> 02:20:54.445
I don't know what you're doin',
but I'm not doin' it with you.
You're nuts!

02:20:54.529 --> 02:20:57.281
I can't swim!
You understand?
Shut up!

02:20:57.365 --> 02:20:59.825
Get outta here.

02:21:04.622 --> 02:21:08.500
I'm ready. Let's go.
I'll go first.

02:21:21.890 --> 02:21:24.641
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
Just dog paddle.

02:21:24.726 --> 02:21:27.352
Take it easy. Okay?

02:21:27.437 --> 02:21:31.315
Hold onto me.
Hold on.

02:22:01.179 --> 02:22:03.889
Hey, not here.
Not here.

02:22:06.184 --> 02:22:08.101
Hey, hey. Here.

02:22:44.973 --> 02:22:47.224
Is it bad?

02:22:47.308 --> 02:22:50.310
No?
No.

02:22:50.395 --> 02:22:53.272
Don't try to move.

02:22:53.356 --> 02:22:55.274
Hey!

02:22:55.358 --> 02:22:58.986
Hey, you guys!
Cut it out! Cut it out!

02:23:06.244 --> 02:23:09.830
Hey! Will ya
quit shootin'?

02:23:09.914 --> 02:23:13.333
We're Company C,
Charlie Company.
There's only two of us.

02:23:13.418 --> 02:23:16.086
And he's wounded.

02:23:16.170 --> 02:23:18.422
Gimme a hand.

02:23:18.506 --> 02:23:20.841
Gimme a hand, will ya?

02:23:20.925 --> 02:23:25.345
You got dog tags?
Sure, I got dog tags.

02:23:29.017 --> 02:23:31.018
Your name?

02:23:31.102 --> 02:23:35.230
Ackerman, 3974287. Okay?

02:23:35.315 --> 02:23:39.026
All right, keep your shirt on.
We're coming.

02:24:02.383 --> 02:24:06.011
Take it easy now.
Be careful. Easy, easy.

02:24:06.095 --> 02:24:08.013
Easy.

02:24:39.754 --> 02:24:41.672
Thanks.

02:24:48.763 --> 02:24:50.889
This here is Red Dog 4.

02:24:50.973 --> 02:24:54.601
A couple of guys from
C Company just come up.
Ackerman and, uh‒

02:24:55.770 --> 02:24:57.688
Burnecker.
Burnecker.

02:24:57.772 --> 02:25:00.857
Burnecker's wounded.
Ackerman ain't got no clothes.

02:25:00.942 --> 02:25:02.984
Better get some up here.

02:25:03.069 --> 02:25:06.655
Ask him if Lieutenant Green
showed up.

02:25:06.739 --> 02:25:08.657
What about Green?

02:25:09.951 --> 02:25:12.703
Uh-huh. Yeah, I gotcha.

02:25:13.788 --> 02:25:15.706
They're all okay.

02:25:15.790 --> 02:25:18.417
They just barely made it.

02:25:18.501 --> 02:25:20.627
How was it out there?

02:25:22.797 --> 02:25:25.298
They're sending up
some dry clothes for you.

02:25:25.383 --> 02:25:28.385
I found some schnapps.
Get you warm.

02:26:15.224 --> 02:26:17.184
Hmm?

02:26:19.687 --> 02:26:21.605
Oh, Michael.

02:26:28.488 --> 02:26:30.405
How'd you get here?

02:26:31.491 --> 02:26:33.617
I have a friend
that's a general.

02:26:33.701 --> 02:26:37.078
I'm pretty big
behind the lines.
Here, put these on.

02:26:47.381 --> 02:26:50.050
What's the matter?

02:26:50.134 --> 02:26:53.470
There's still‒
Hey, uh‒

02:26:54.639 --> 02:26:56.640
Could one of you, uh,

02:26:58.226 --> 02:27:01.061
pass the word down the line...

02:27:01.145 --> 02:27:03.480
to hold fire for, like,
10, 15 minutes?

02:27:03.564 --> 02:27:07.359
What gives?
There's a guy we left over there.

02:27:07.443 --> 02:27:11.488
Vernon, you go down
the line and tell those
trigger-happy joes...

02:27:11.572 --> 02:27:16.076
if they see a derriere
in the canal,
it's one of ours.

02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:19.329
Who's out there?
Cowley.

02:27:19.413 --> 02:27:21.414
Oh, Cowley. Good.

02:27:22.542 --> 02:27:26.044
Yeah, except he can't swim.
Even better.

02:27:26.128 --> 02:27:29.089
Look, you don't owe him
anything. Nothing.

02:27:29.173 --> 02:27:31.967
No, I don't.

02:27:38.266 --> 02:27:41.560
You've just been out there.
There are plenty other guys.

02:27:41.644 --> 02:27:44.521
How about you, son?
You look fat and sassy.

02:27:44.605 --> 02:27:46.940
Wait a minute.
I just got here.

02:27:50.444 --> 02:27:53.029
Besides, I'm a coward.

02:28:27.315 --> 02:28:29.232
Cowley?

02:28:37.658 --> 02:28:40.160
- Cowley?
- What do you want?

02:28:44.540 --> 02:28:47.167
- Come on. Let's go.
- Will you leave me alone?

02:28:48.502 --> 02:28:50.462
Cowley, it's not deep.

02:28:52.256 --> 02:28:54.716
Damn you, it's not deep!

02:28:54.800 --> 02:28:57.385
The guys are waiting
for us! Now come on!

02:29:01.223 --> 02:29:03.224
No. No, I'm not going.

02:29:05.269 --> 02:29:08.438
- Okay.
- Wait!

02:30:06.288 --> 02:30:08.581
You all right, Noah?
Yeah.

02:31:58.734 --> 02:32:02.487
I would like to speak with
your commandant, please.
Ja, Kapitän.

02:32:25.261 --> 02:32:27.512
Enter, Kapitän.

02:32:32.268 --> 02:32:35.687
Yes?
I was wondering if
you had some food, sir.

02:32:35.771 --> 02:32:39.274
We have no food.
We've already been
cleaned out by deserters.

02:32:41.235 --> 02:32:43.987
I'm not a deserter.

02:32:44.071 --> 02:32:48.950
My company has defected, I am
without command and I have not
eaten anything in two days.

02:32:51.203 --> 02:32:54.873
Forgive me, Captain.
Sit down. Pour yourself
some coffee.

02:33:03.090 --> 02:33:07.844
It's a relief to find
someone who still has some
sense of discipline left.

02:33:07.928 --> 02:33:10.930
How close
are the Americans?

02:33:11.015 --> 02:33:15.226
Well, I think they are‒
I don't know‒ five minutes
or five hours.

02:33:16.604 --> 02:33:19.522
I'm sorry.
That's all that's left.
Thank you.

02:33:19.607 --> 02:33:22.233
Everything is gone.

02:33:22.318 --> 02:33:26.571
Colonels and generals
passing by, snatching the food
out of my hands,

02:33:26.655 --> 02:33:28.990
throwing away their uniforms.

02:33:30.075 --> 02:33:33.620
Unbelievable.
My men are running too.

02:33:33.704 --> 02:33:37.749
This organization is falling
apart in front of my eyes.

02:33:37.833 --> 02:33:40.418
I'm sorry.

02:33:40.502 --> 02:33:43.880
Are you hurt?
No.

02:33:43.964 --> 02:33:46.883
I can see you had
a bad time.

02:33:46.967 --> 02:33:49.010
Well, so did I.

02:33:49.094 --> 02:33:51.888
I have my wounds, too,
even if you don't see them.

02:33:51.972 --> 02:33:54.807
Running a concentration camp
is not a picnic, believe me,

02:33:54.892 --> 02:33:59.395
with all the gas chambers,
target ranges, doctors
with their experiments.

02:33:59.480 --> 02:34:02.607
I had an extermination quota
of 1,500 people a day--

02:34:02.691 --> 02:34:06.861
Jews, Poles, Russians, French,
political prisoners.

02:34:06.946 --> 02:34:11.241
And I had only 260 men to do it.
Still I managed it.

02:34:11.325 --> 02:34:15.370
Then they sent memorandums
from Berlin, inspectors
running, shouting,

02:34:15.454 --> 02:34:17.747
"In Auschwitz they kill
20,000 a day."

02:34:20.668 --> 02:34:22.710
I know who it is.

02:34:22.795 --> 02:34:24.921
It's Berlin again...

02:34:25.005 --> 02:34:27.382
for the fourth time today.

02:34:30.469 --> 02:34:32.887
Yes?

02:34:32.972 --> 02:34:34.973
Yes.

02:34:35.057 --> 02:34:37.475
Very near. A few miles.

02:34:37.559 --> 02:34:40.645
I told you.
All right, I didn't tell you.

02:34:40.729 --> 02:34:43.356
I told whoever
it was that called.

02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:48.903
I have 10 men left.
How can I kill everybody
in the camp?

02:34:48.988 --> 02:34:52.282
Don't you understand?
The equipment is not working.

02:34:52.366 --> 02:34:54.617
Nothing is working.

02:34:54.702 --> 02:34:57.537
I don't care what
they did in Buchenwald.

02:34:57.621 --> 02:35:00.707
I'm here alone, and I have
no personnel left!

02:35:05.379 --> 02:35:08.756
You know what this is,
this phone call?

02:35:08.841 --> 02:35:13.386
They want me to kill every man,
woman and child in the camp
before the Americans get here.

02:35:13.470 --> 02:35:15.388
6,000 people.

02:35:20.561 --> 02:35:24.439
And the man who asked me
to do this‒ this same man‒
will walk the streets free.

02:35:24.523 --> 02:35:27.984
And they will come to him,
the Americans, the Russians,

02:35:28.068 --> 02:35:32.322
and he will say, "I've never
heard of concentration camps."

02:35:32.406 --> 02:35:36.826
He will say there never
was a national policy
to kill 12 million people.

02:35:36.910 --> 02:35:38.828
The SS invented it.

02:35:38.912 --> 02:35:43.082
Nobody in the government
ever heard of it.

02:35:43.167 --> 02:35:47.420
And I'll be here trying to
explain to the Americans.

02:35:47.504 --> 02:35:52.717
Do you know,
the Americans may not
understand what they see here.

02:35:52.801 --> 02:35:55.928
They may not know
that the German officer‒
our kind of officer‒

02:35:56.013 --> 02:35:58.723
does what he's ordered to do.

02:36:05.606 --> 02:36:08.941
Well, we at least know...

02:36:09.026 --> 02:36:10.943
what is important--

02:36:11.028 --> 02:36:14.072
The courage to stay
and face the enemy...

02:36:14.156 --> 02:36:18.868
and the honor to be able to say,
"I have done my duty
for the fatherland."

02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:29.837
What's the matter?

02:37:54.214 --> 02:37:56.132
My God.

02:38:03.307 --> 02:38:07.143
Captain, this is
the mayor of the town we just
came through on our way up here.

02:38:07.227 --> 02:38:09.812
He says he can send a gang
of civilians in to help us.

02:38:09.897 --> 02:38:11.814
As I was telling
the sergeant, Captain,

02:38:11.899 --> 02:38:16.861
we have heard some of your most
important generals and newspapermen
are on their way up here.

02:38:16.945 --> 02:38:19.947
I can provide you with a
number of my townspeople...

02:38:20.032 --> 02:38:23.201
who will help you to
clean up this place‒
Yes?

02:38:23.285 --> 02:38:26.537
Excuse me.

02:38:26.622 --> 02:38:29.999
My name is Joseph Silverson.
I am a rabbi.

02:38:30.083 --> 02:38:32.502
Yes.

02:38:32.586 --> 02:38:38.090
I do not wish to annoy
the officer, but I have
a request to make.

02:38:38.175 --> 02:38:40.092
Yes, what is it?

02:38:41.887 --> 02:38:44.180
Thousands have died here.

02:38:44.264 --> 02:38:46.766
More will die tonight,
tomorrow.

02:38:48.435 --> 02:38:51.270
Sorry, Rabbi.
We're doing all we can.

02:38:51.355 --> 02:38:55.024
Of course. I know that.

02:38:55.108 --> 02:38:57.777
But there's nothing
to be done for them.

02:38:57.861 --> 02:39:01.239
Nothing material.
We understand that.

02:39:01.323 --> 02:39:03.866
All efforts must be
for the living.

02:39:05.661 --> 02:39:09.789
What I am asking for
is a luxury.

02:39:12.251 --> 02:39:15.169
Yes?

02:39:15.254 --> 02:39:17.922
I ask to be permitted
to collect all of us,

02:39:18.006 --> 02:39:22.218
the living
and those without hope,

02:39:22.302 --> 02:39:24.512
and hold a religious service‒

02:39:24.596 --> 02:39:28.849
a service for the dead
who have come to their end here.

02:39:32.312 --> 02:39:36.065
There has never been
a religious service
for us in this place.

02:39:36.149 --> 02:39:38.693
Permit me, Captain.
I don't like to intrude.

02:39:38.777 --> 02:39:41.445
I understand why the rabbi
has made this request,

02:39:41.530 --> 02:39:43.948
but this is
not the time for it.

02:39:44.032 --> 02:39:48.494
I'm a European.
I understand things perhaps
the captain doesn't understand.

02:39:48.579 --> 02:39:53.457
If you allow this gentleman
to hold the services,
I'm obliged to warn you.

02:39:53.542 --> 02:39:58.921
There will be riots.
The other prisoners will
not stand for it, and...

02:39:59.006 --> 02:40:02.383
the generals who are coming
will not like what they see.

02:40:09.224 --> 02:40:14.270
The, uh, other prisoners
will not stand for it and
the generals will not like it?

02:40:14.354 --> 02:40:16.856
That's a fact.
I guarantee it.

02:40:28.493 --> 02:40:32.580
I'm gonna guarantee
something myself.

02:40:32.664 --> 02:40:36.000
I'm gonna guarantee that you‒
you'll hold your services.

02:40:36.084 --> 02:40:39.378
I'm also gonna
guarantee that machine guns
will be set up...

02:40:39.463 --> 02:40:41.797
on the roofs of the buildings.

02:40:41.882 --> 02:40:45.718
And further, I will guarantee
that anyone who attempts to
interfere with those services...

02:40:45.802 --> 02:40:47.970
will be fired upon
by those machine guns.

02:40:50.223 --> 02:40:53.976
And further, I guarantee
that if you ever try to come
into this place again,

02:40:54.061 --> 02:40:56.187
I will personally break
your neck.

02:40:56.271 --> 02:40:58.230
That is all.

02:41:06.740 --> 02:41:09.033
Thank you very much, sir.

02:41:27.511 --> 02:41:31.430
Ackerman, you're not
needed around here.
Go take a walk outside the camp.

02:41:34.351 --> 02:41:36.268
Thank you, sir.

02:41:38.188 --> 02:41:40.106
Whiteacre.

02:42:03.588 --> 02:42:05.881
How do you feel?

02:42:05.966 --> 02:42:07.925
Fine, fine.

02:42:09.761 --> 02:42:13.139
I never‒ Did you
ever imagine it could
be like that?

02:42:13.223 --> 02:42:15.141
Nope.

02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:19.145
My father's brother
died in one of those.

02:42:20.772 --> 02:42:23.399
Did you see them?
The ovens?

02:42:23.483 --> 02:42:25.401
Yeah, yeah.

02:42:27.529 --> 02:42:30.865
Did I ever tell you
about my father?
No.

02:42:35.662 --> 02:42:39.165
When that guy started
to talk to Green...

02:42:39.249 --> 02:42:42.209
I could've gone outside
and blown my brains out.
I felt the same way.

02:42:42.294 --> 02:42:47.256
And then Green said,
"I guarantee.
I guarantee."

02:42:47.340 --> 02:42:50.050
I don't know. I got a lot
of hope for Captain Green.

02:42:51.344 --> 02:42:54.597
You know what?
When this war's over,

02:42:54.681 --> 02:42:57.516
Green is gonna be
running the world.

02:42:57.601 --> 02:43:02.438
There are millions
of him. Millions!
They're human beings.

02:43:02.522 --> 02:43:05.733
There are millions,
millions of them!
They're gonna run the world!

02:44:54.801 --> 02:44:57.386
Kraut!

02:46:37.862 --> 02:46:40.114
Hey!
