13:12.424 --> 13:15.154
HAYLEY: Come, come sit down
for a second, okay?

13:17.029 --> 13:19.054
All right, just breathe and close your eyes

13:19.131 --> 13:22.225
and try and think of a place
that makes you happy and calm.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.531
You got it? Where are you?

13:24.603 --> 13:28.039
I'm with my dad.
We're walking near Walden Pond. It's fall.

13:28.107 --> 13:31.668
- The leaves are changing.
- You're not here. You're there.

13:32.011 --> 13:33.239
Better?

13:35.080 --> 13:36.809
- Yeah.
- Okay.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.443
Hey, Mia, are you okay?

13:39.985 --> 13:43.182
I'm great.
I actually think this is kinda awesome.

13:43.622 --> 13:46.455
I can finally get to know you guys.
I have questions.

13:46.525 --> 13:48.220
No. Now is not the time.

13:48.294 --> 13:51.127
Oh, come on.
You guys totally fascinate me.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.931
- Especially you, Brooke.
- Really?

13:54.366 --> 13:57.426
Well, in that case, ask away, my dear.

13:57.937 --> 14:00.838
Okay. Like, you're really successful, right?

14:00.906 --> 14:04.171
- Like, really cool and rich?
- Yes, yes and yes.

14:05.211 --> 14:09.807
So why do you let that horrible stink
of a mom boss you around all the time?

14:11.450 --> 14:13.714
You should quit being so nosy.

14:14.787 --> 14:16.618
Come on, Brooke.
You know she's not nice.

14:16.689 --> 14:20.557
- I'm not talking about my mom.
- Hey. She doesn't appreciate you.

14:20.626 --> 14:24.392
- She is my mother, all right?
- That doesn't make it right.

14:24.797 --> 14:28.164
Okay. It's time for the two new kids
to stay the hell out of it,

14:28.234 --> 14:31.601
and as for you two,
I expect you both to understand.

14:33.005 --> 14:36.463
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know what it means.

14:36.942 --> 14:39.502
Neither of your moms were around,
at least not in all the time

14:39.578 --> 14:41.808
that I've been friends with you.

14:41.881 --> 14:45.317
And I'm sorry for that, but what if you had
a chance to have them back in your lives?

14:45.384 --> 14:47.147
Brooke, I would love to have them back,

14:47.219 --> 14:50.120
both of them, all right? But I would hope
that they'd be coming back

14:50.189 --> 14:52.851
because they love me,
not because they wanted to run my label.

14:52.925 --> 14:55.792
- Oh, the label I financed?
- No, easy. I'm with you.

14:55.861 --> 14:59.524
Now. You are with me now, Peyton,

14:59.732 --> 15:03.566
but for the last four years,
my mom has been with me every day

15:03.636 --> 15:05.627
helping me create a pretty great company.

15:05.704 --> 15:07.865
That's not true.

15:09.108 --> 15:12.805
I was with you when you created that
pretty great company, and so was Peyton.

15:12.878 --> 15:16.336
Maybe your mom made it bigger,
but you created it all by yourself.

15:16.415 --> 15:20.852
You did. You made it great before your
mom even stepped into the picture.

15:21.020 --> 15:22.715
You guys don't know anything about it.

15:22.788 --> 15:25.484
Maybe not, but I do know
that a mother's love is unconditional,

15:25.557 --> 15:27.286
and you don't have to earn it,
and you don't have to

15:27.359 --> 15:29.850
design a fashion label to keep it.

15:30.329 --> 15:31.728
It just is.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.664
You don't know anything about it.

15:52.584 --> 15:53.744
You okay?

15:53.819 --> 15:56.413
I'm thinking I can break this window.

15:57.022 --> 15:59.490
Lindsey, somebody's gonna come
get us out of here.

15:59.558 --> 16:02.254
- I can do it.
- No... Oh... Okay.

16:02.328 --> 16:03.955
(SCREAMS)

16:05.364 --> 16:07.059
(PANTING)

16:07.132 --> 16:09.794
Jeez, that chair is really heavy.

16:17.009 --> 16:18.135
Hey.

16:20.179 --> 16:23.114
Check it out.
I found librarian Glaufelte's stash.

16:23.182 --> 16:26.242
We always knew she was boozy.
Want some?

16:31.056 --> 16:32.648
Whatcha reading?

16:35.427 --> 16:36.758
<i>B. Davis.</i>

16:41.433 --> 16:43.663
She came up with this, Peyton.

16:44.970 --> 16:49.339
The magazine, the high-end clientele,
Victoria did all of it.

16:50.175 --> 16:54.339
I know. But it's not called <i>V. Davis,</i> is it?

16:59.818 --> 17:03.345
All those years growing up,
I just wanted her to see me.

17:04.522 --> 17:08.983
To see me and appreciate me
and maybe love me.

17:12.931 --> 17:17.925
And now that I have it, even if it's for
the wrong reasons, it's hard to let it go.

17:20.105 --> 17:22.096
Can you understand that?

17:24.443 --> 17:25.535
Yeah.

17:32.451 --> 17:33.440
This is terrible.

17:33.519 --> 17:36.283
It's Lucas' first game,
we're stuck in this stupid library.

17:36.355 --> 17:39.324
- Ah, I wish we knew the score.
- Ravens down by eight.

17:39.491 --> 17:42.483
Wait, let me refresh. Ravens down by ten.

17:43.529 --> 17:45.497
- Are you online?
- Yeah.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.594
Brooke, Peyton, come here.
We got Internet.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.931
Hey, you guys want to see me at Tric?

17:51.003 --> 17:53.494
Okay, there's got to be a way
we can use this to get out.

17:53.572 --> 17:56.769
Or at least order a pizza.
I'm starving. No, that's it.

17:56.842 --> 17:58.434
Do we need to be thinking
about food right now?

17:58.510 --> 18:01.343
No, we order pizza online. We have it
delivered here so we can get out.

18:01.413 --> 18:03.506
- Oh.
- Okay, Blackwell's Pizzeria...

18:03.582 --> 18:07.985
They are open.
You can order online, and they deliver.

18:08.053 --> 18:09.543
- Yes.
- Nice.

18:10.856 --> 18:13.188
- So, what are we getting?
- What?

18:13.425 --> 18:15.154
What kind of pizza?

18:15.561 --> 18:17.927
- I don't know. Mushroom and sausage.
- Oh, no mushroom, please, I...

18:17.996 --> 18:19.964
- Brooke.
- Actually, I'm totally with Brooke.

18:20.032 --> 18:21.897
- Canadian bacon?
- Canadian bacon. Extra cheese.

18:21.967 --> 18:23.525
- You guys, seriously...
- Just order the damn pizza.

18:23.602 --> 18:25.763
- Okay. Do not yell at me.
- I'll yell at you if I want.

18:25.838 --> 18:28.102
Just order it. Freaking sausage,
freaking Canadian bacon

18:28.173 --> 18:29.902
freaking mushroom,
I wanna get the hell out of here.

18:29.975 --> 18:31.772
We all want to get the hell out of here,
okay?

18:31.844 --> 18:34.278
- Don't yell at me.
- HAYLEY: Calm down. God.

18:37.216 --> 18:38.843
Just no mushroom.

18:41.553 --> 18:44.420
There. It's ordered. Are we all happy now?

18:45.557 --> 18:46.683
What'd we get?

18:46.758 --> 18:49.192
No mushroom, Brooke, okay?
No mush, no room, no mushroom!

18:49.261 --> 18:51.422
Okay. Everybody, please relax, okay?
The pizza guy's gonna come,

18:51.497 --> 18:53.556
he's gonna let us out, and maybe
we'll make the end of the game,

18:53.632 --> 18:56.430
so in the meantime,
everybody just calm down.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.642
You did a great job with my record, Haley.

19:07.212 --> 19:08.543
Thank you.

19:09.548 --> 19:11.345
(LAUGHS)

19:11.416 --> 19:13.145
Where did that come from?

19:13.218 --> 19:15.846
I don't know. I just think we tear each
other down enough, you know?

19:15.921 --> 19:18.856
And sometimes you should tell people
the things that you love about 'em,

19:18.924 --> 19:22.860
like something they're really great at
or a quality they have that you admire,

19:22.928 --> 19:25.863
and I don't know,
you did a really good job.

19:26.431 --> 19:29.161
Courage. Haley's courageous.

19:29.401 --> 19:32.393
- And strong.
- And kind.

19:33.138 --> 19:35.436
See, don't you feel
like you're pretty awesome now?

19:35.507 --> 19:37.668
Yeah, I kinda do.

19:37.743 --> 19:40.803
- Okay, do me. What's great about me?
- Your voice. It's an amazing gift.

19:40.879 --> 19:43.939
- The fact that you came up with this game.
- Your boobs.

19:44.049 --> 19:47.815
And your lips. I would kill for lips like that.
You know?

19:47.886 --> 19:50.184
And you've got good legs.
It's like a whole...

19:50.255 --> 19:53.224
(LAUGHS) Okay. Before this turns into
a women-in-prison film,

19:53.292 --> 19:55.522
I think we should move on.

19:56.662 --> 19:59.825
Lindsey. Your eyes are, like, not even fair.

20:00.465 --> 20:02.296
You're also one of the smartest people
I know.

20:02.367 --> 20:04.392
- I am not.
- And you're classy.

20:04.469 --> 20:05.834
You guys...

20:08.640 --> 20:12.804
Peyton, isn't there something nice
you'd like to say about Lindsey?

20:16.548 --> 20:18.709
She's got decent taste in men.

20:22.354 --> 20:23.946
This game sucks.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.617
I'm intimidated by Peyton.

20:31.830 --> 20:36.790
I spent a year editing a book
that was basically a love letter to her.

20:37.736 --> 20:41.433
I watched how caring and meticulous
Lucas was with the words

20:41.506 --> 20:44.942
he chose for her,
like he was still holding on to her.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.147
Sometimes I think he still is.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.456
Which is why he proposed to you, right?

21:00.692 --> 21:02.523
Yeah, I can see that.

21:04.663 --> 21:06.722
God, I hate this library.

21:15.307 --> 21:16.865
- I found it.
- A way out?

21:16.942 --> 21:19.376
No. Lucas' book. I never read it.

21:26.652 --> 21:28.643
They replaced the carpet.

21:32.758 --> 21:36.421
This is where Lucas and I hid out
during the school shooting,

21:36.495 --> 21:39.328
but they changed the carpet.
It doesn't match.

21:40.499 --> 21:43.491
I'm not gonna tell you
how to be with Lindsey.

21:44.403 --> 21:46.837
But most of your life,
I've known you to take the high road.

21:46.905 --> 21:52.969
I know, Brooke. I'm so sick
of looking at her and her precious ring.

21:55.180 --> 21:57.307
You mean your precious ring?

22:02.154 --> 22:03.416
(BOTH LAUGHING)

22:03.488 --> 22:04.955
All right. One more.

22:05.424 --> 22:06.891
(BOTH EX CLAIMING)

22:07.526 --> 22:09.551
Score me. Score me, Haley.

22:10.829 --> 22:13.297
Ravens are down by nine. Halftime.

22:14.966 --> 22:16.763
Wait. Hold on.

22:17.135 --> 22:20.571
Are you telling me Lucas slept with
Peyton, Brooke, and you, Lindsey?

22:20.639 --> 22:22.937
Yeah. Not all at the same time.

22:23.008 --> 22:24.498
(LAUGHING)

22:24.576 --> 22:26.806
Jeez, Haley, you sure you never
got in on that?

22:26.878 --> 22:28.436
Ew, he's like my brother.

22:28.513 --> 22:31.243
I'm just saying. Jamie looks a lot like him.

22:31.316 --> 22:32.749
Ah, they're like twins.

22:32.818 --> 22:35.013
- They are not.
- Yes, they are.

22:35.854 --> 22:38.880
And what inbred moron
is taking so long with our pizza?

22:39.791 --> 22:42.919
(NEVER EVEN TOLD ME HER NAME
<i>PLA YING)</i>

22:55.240 --> 22:57.037
Well, well, well.

23:00.946 --> 23:03.608
Oh, my God,
4,000 hits for my video at Tric.

23:03.682 --> 23:06.981
Listen to these comments.
"You rock. Where can I buy this?"

23:07.052 --> 23:08.451
That's really great, Mia.

23:08.520 --> 23:12.320
"This song is awesome.
I'd love to see this chick naked."

23:13.091 --> 23:15.821
- Ew.
- It's just one comment.

23:15.894 --> 23:17.054
No, wait, there's more.

23:17.129 --> 23:19.529
"Another pop princess
who can't sing or play.

23:19.598 --> 23:21.998
"She looks like she smells like dirty feet"?

23:22.067 --> 23:23.898
- What's wrong with people?
- You need to stop.

23:23.969 --> 23:25.937
Do you know what people
use the Internet for?

23:26.004 --> 23:27.665
- Porn and complaining.
- Yep.

23:27.739 --> 23:31.004
But that's so not fair. They have to know
there's somebody reading this.

23:31.076 --> 23:33.874
It's the easiest thing in the world
to tear down somebody's work.

23:33.945 --> 23:37.574
The hard part is actually creating it.
It's criticism versus creation.

23:37.649 --> 23:39.310
Do you love making music?

23:39.384 --> 23:43.480
- Yeah.
- Okay, so the rest doesn't matter.

23:43.588 --> 23:46.580
Easy for you to say.
They didn't say you smell like feet.

23:46.658 --> 23:48.751
Oh, sticks and stones, Mia.

23:49.995 --> 23:52.156
Oh, right. This coming from the girl
that couldn't handle it

23:52.230 --> 23:54.494
when I said I didn't like her.

23:54.933 --> 23:59.029
Okay. Let's just check the scorecard
on this one, Miss "Pity me."

23:59.137 --> 24:02.470
You dated the guy two years ago,
you disappeared

24:02.541 --> 24:05.533
then you come back
and expect him to drop everything

24:05.610 --> 24:09.137
for the love of your bony, jobless ass.
W.T. F?

24:09.214 --> 24:10.977
Okay, D.U.I.

24:11.049 --> 24:13.244
Nice work, Haley.
Better save old drinky here

24:13.318 --> 24:15.912
before I kick her spoiled ass
all the way back to Walden Pond.

24:15.987 --> 24:17.750
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

24:17.823 --> 24:21.054
Guess this is the second time
you'll be bleeding all over this library.

24:21.126 --> 24:23.720
You think that's funny?
You think that's funny?

24:23.795 --> 24:25.854
(ALL SHOUTING)

24:25.931 --> 24:29.128
Tim Smith is in the lib-ra-zee!

24:29.634 --> 24:30.999
Oh, my God.

24:31.770 --> 24:34.170
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God. Brooke.

24:34.239 --> 24:37.003
No! No. No, no.

24:37.108 --> 24:38.473
- Put me down.
- It's so good to see...

24:38.543 --> 24:41.944
No. You idiot! The door is locked.

24:42.013 --> 24:44.004
No, it's not. I just walked in, Brooke.

24:44.082 --> 24:46.141
From the outside, Tim.

24:46.218 --> 24:48.516
The door is locked from the outside.

24:48.587 --> 24:50.350
We cannot get out.

24:50.856 --> 24:52.323
Girl, chill.

24:52.791 --> 24:57.194
I'll just call somebody at the pizza place
and have them send someone...

24:57.696 --> 24:59.561
- I left my phone in my scooter.
- Oh?

24:59.631 --> 25:01.895
Motorcycle. It's a motorcycle.

25:05.570 --> 25:08.767
Well, since we're locked in here all alone,

25:10.675 --> 25:14.771
who wants a piece? Extra sausage.

25:17.282 --> 25:20.945
Ravens trail by nine. Sold-out crowd.

25:22.754 --> 25:26.417
Come on, Mouth.
There's a great story here. Find it.

25:40.005 --> 25:42.235
BROOKE: Oh, my God. Please don't fall.

25:44.776 --> 25:46.368
(GIRLS LAUGHING)

25:46.811 --> 25:51.111
If you had to eat any part of a person
to stay alive, what would you eat?

25:51.182 --> 25:52.308
What?

25:52.584 --> 25:56.543
Like, I don't know,
say we ran out of food and Haley died.

25:56.621 --> 25:58.088
Thanks a lot.

25:58.990 --> 26:01.254
Okay, someone else dies,
and we need to survive.

26:01.326 --> 26:03.317
- What do you eat?
- I know what I'm starting with.

26:03.395 --> 26:06.296
- Don't say it, perv.
- Love handles.

26:06.865 --> 26:10.198
I'd make, like, beef jerky
out of their love handles.

26:11.269 --> 26:12.702
You could snack on that for days.

26:12.771 --> 26:16.537
Ew. I so would not eat
someone's love handles.

and we're all gonna eat you, then.

26:19.144 --> 26:21.044

26:21.112 --> 26:22.136
No.

like a vampire.

26:27.152 --> 26:29.416
- You guys, seriously.
- What's the big deal?

26:29.487 --> 26:30.954
You're dead, and I'm hungry.

26:31.022 --> 26:34.549
- Yeah, don't you want us to live?
- We're hungry, Brooke.

26:35.427 --> 26:36.724
Please.

26:36.795 --> 26:41.858
Okay. Chow down, but I am gonna haunt
each and every one of you.

26:44.436 --> 26:45.960

- Totally.
- Yeah, don't even get me started.

Do you believe in ghosts, Linds?

26:51.676 --> 26:53.644
I think if someone dies suddenly,

26:53.712 --> 26:57.170
especially before their time,
maybe they get confused.

26:57.248 --> 26:59.648
They don't know to leave a place.

27:05.724 --> 27:07.715

27:18.970 --> 27:23.407
I wish you were here tonight, Jim.
We were supposed to do this together.

27:33.785 --> 27:35.912
And this is a picture of my son.

27:35.987 --> 27:40.856
A lot of people say he looks like me, but
I'm not quite sure he's that handsome.

27:41.326 --> 27:43.419
He's really something.

27:43.795 --> 27:45.786
- What's his name?
- Nathan.

27:59.477 --> 28:02.002

hot chocolate.

How about you, Peyton? Your mom ever
bring you hot chocolate on a snow day?

28:05.216 --> 28:06.979
No, I didn't have...

28:08.386 --> 28:10.547
I didn't have a whole lot of snow days.

28:10.622 --> 28:13.352
Brooke and I did build
a pretty killer snow fort once.

28:13.425 --> 28:17.361
And you sat in it, and you worried
that your lives were about to change.

28:17.429 --> 28:19.659
Just because you edited
a book about my life

28:19.731 --> 28:22.063
doesn't mean you know
anything about me.

28:22.133 --> 28:25.034

Do you know how
Lindsey and I got so close?

She was editing Lucas' book,
and I still wasn't really sure about her,

33:41.853 --> 33:46.347
'cause I was rooting for Lucas
to be with my friend Peyton.

33:47.125 --> 33:48.956
Or maybe even Brooke.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.555
Anyway, she...

33:54.899 --> 33:59.097
She was working on the chapter
about the shooting, and she said to me,

33:59.170 --> 34:01.832
"I want this to be Lucas' best writing,

34:02.974 --> 34:06.171
"the best he has in him,
because Peyton deserves it.

34:09.347 --> 34:12.714
"Jimmy and Keith deserve it,
and that day deserves it."

34:17.621 --> 34:20.056

Can I please talk with you?

34:36.474 --> 34:39.237
I'm sorry. God, Lindsey, I'm sorry.

34:39.744 --> 34:42.235
I am so sorry for what I said
about your father, okay?

34:42.313 --> 34:44.713
I lost my mom to cancer, and I...

34:46.117 --> 34:47.447
I'm sorry.

34:48.652 --> 34:51.679
I don't know what it is, but for
whatever reason, you bring out

34:51.755 --> 34:56.386
the insecurities in me, and I end up being
the worst possible version of myself.

34:57.161 --> 34:58.924
Welcome to the club.

35:02.500 --> 35:04.730
Haley told me what you said about

35:04.802 --> 35:09.705
wanting to get that chapter right in the
book, the one about the school shooting.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.440
And I think that's what makes it so hard,

35:12.510 --> 35:16.037
you know, the fact that Lucas
has found this person that's so great

35:16.114 --> 35:18.344
and that has such a big heart.

35:20.351 --> 35:24.651
And it was never my ring,
I was just trying to hurt you.

35:25.623 --> 35:29.024
The only reason I recognized it
is 'cause that's the ring

35:29.093 --> 35:31.823
Keith gave Karen when he proposed to her

35:32.463 --> 35:36.297
before he walked into this school
and never walked out again.

35:36.667 --> 35:41.104
So you have to know how much Lucas
loves you if he wanted you to have it.

35:42.473 --> 35:44.600
Why would you tell me that?

35:46.577 --> 35:48.568
So you stop doubting it.

35:50.314 --> 35:53.750
So we stop doing this. I mean, God, you...
You gave me a clean slate,

35:53.818 --> 35:56.514
and I said something dumb
that I didn't even mean,

35:56.587 --> 35:59.488
and I was just too stubborn
to take it back.

36:01.159 --> 36:05.152
I guess it's obvious that I'm not
the Peyton in the book anymore.

36:05.463 --> 36:07.488
The truth is I never was.

36:08.566 --> 36:12.798
I think you were.
And I think you still are. It's just...

36:14.605 --> 36:16.903
You're not that couple anymore.

36:17.642 --> 36:22.011
And in a way, it breaks my heart,
'cause I really was rooting for them.

36:24.081 --> 36:27.016
But Lucas and I have written
our own chapter now,

36:27.084 --> 36:29.985
and that's a chapter I won't apologize for.

36:31.155 --> 36:33.055
No, you don't have to.

36:36.127 --> 36:39.426
And you don't have
a man-face or a big ass.

36:40.164 --> 36:43.156
The fact is, you have
a pretty great ass, so...

36:43.935 --> 36:49.134
Okay. Before this turns into
a women-in-prison film,

36:51.075 --> 36:53.066
