41:34.520 --> 41:37.520
yeah

41:44.930 --> 41:49.368

I think you might be confusing happiness
with you Tara tell me is there something

42:16.150 --> 42:17.860
going on here

42:17.860 --> 42:19.890
I don't know

42:19.890 --> 42:22.890
I'm kind of new at all this

42:23.579 --> 42:29.609
another thing my timing was terrific
with today being you know I know her

42:29.609 --> 42:31.200
parents were good people

42:31.200 --> 42:39.480
that's so sad what happened to them it
was a car accident four years ago today

42:39.480 --> 42:44.549
they just bought the Christmas tree and
they were driving home when they hit a

42:44.549 --> 42:46.060
patch of black ice

42:46.060 --> 42:49.330
Emma and Alice were pretty banged up

42:50.880 --> 42:54.119
but person Julie didn't make it

42:54.119 --> 43:01.470
I'm terrible mm it's always hard to lose
a parent but to lose both them in that

43:01.470 --> 43:04.470
way it Christmastime

43:06.470 --> 43:09.470
it's just tragic

43:10.490 --> 43:17.029
I had no idea and our memories raising
his sister Alice yep she's put her

43:17.030 --> 43:22.160
entire life on hold to take care of your
little sister that hand keeping her

43:22.160 --> 43:26.390
father's diner open that's what drives
our everyday

43:26.390 --> 43:29.930
emma is a remarkable girl

43:31.940 --> 43:35.240
so how do you know her

43:35.240 --> 43:38.240
we met at the diner ship around this
afternoon

43:39.080 --> 43:47.630
mhm would that have something to do with
why you missed your train today it might

43:47.630 --> 43:53.750
have something to do with that yes
people now I know this is none of my

43:53.750 --> 44:00.859
business but let's just say
hypothetically someone were interested

44:00.859 --> 44:04.130
in Emma and they asked my advice

44:08.240 --> 44:13.790
well with everything that she's been
through I think she would really

44:13.790 --> 44:18.020
appreciate it if someone were to offer
her some help for a change

44:18.980 --> 44:23.930
hypothetically of course

44:31.720 --> 44:33.299
yeah

44:33.300 --> 44:36.300
yeah

44:47.650 --> 45:03.310
Your Majesty anything he's still here
never boarded why not i'd venture to say

45:03.310 --> 45:05.380
he was highly distracted

45:05.380 --> 45:08.380
what kind of distraction five today

45:09.760 --> 45:19.240
good work Jeffrey would you like me to
intervene sir em they're Russian not yet

45:19.240 --> 45:25.930

shot reportedly well what about the

45:25.930 --> 45:33.879

ourselves now understood your majesty

45:48.990 --> 45:59.549
there you are mother is there any news
on Duncan know my love

46:00.270 --> 46:04.259
nothing yet i know it's all my fault
i've driven him away

46:04.800 --> 46:10.560
simple as that wedding of this magnitude
would be stressful on anyone

46:10.560 --> 46:13.950
it wouldn't be a wedding of this
magnitude if it wasn't for me

46:13.950 --> 46:19.200
I mean you only get married once and I
just wanted us to be the most perfect

46:19.200 --> 46:22.169
wedding and now we have everything at
stake

46:22.170 --> 46:27.960
Ariana they just titles

46:27.960 --> 46:33.030
that's all I was Duncan's age once and I
know what he's going through

46:33.030 --> 46:36.869
he just needs time that's all really

46:36.869 --> 46:40.770
mm don't think I didn't have
reservations even about our wedding

46:40.770 --> 46:48.270
that's true and we worked out all right
didn't we yes we did and that's because

46:48.270 --> 46:54.240
no one made us get married we got
married because we wanted to and I

46:54.240 --> 46:55.540
promise you

46:55.540 --> 47:01.300
all will be well and Duncan will come
home it's certainly better

47:10.640 --> 47:16.910
I have a delivery for gorgeous

47:16.910 --> 47:23.540

don't take too long

47:42.790 --> 47:52.240
only five days until sandals you under
my tree love Todd ok take the

47:59.150 --> 48:03.980
good morning and beginning to think you
don't actually have a train to catch it

48:03.980 --> 48:05.150
all

48:05.150 --> 48:11.390
why is there a sale sign outside and
gets time to wake up and realize I can't

48:11.390 --> 48:14.540

come in handy

48:15.170 --> 48:18.950
maybe I can help you but and it's
Christmas

48:18.950 --> 48:23.810
this place should be packed and really
is dead mother's day an orphanage but

48:23.810 --> 48:27.560
what I'm trying to say is that perhaps
selling the diner isn't the only option

48:27.560 --> 48:31.610
maybe we can liven things up a little
bit at least try

48:32.780 --> 48:38.630

to some mutations something a little bit

48:38.630 --> 48:46.850

you mean this burger flipping is only

49:23.110 --> 49:26.110
temporary until I open my own place

49:26.110 --> 49:30.400
really you're in place to be the only
gourmet restaurant in all of the roar

49:30.400 --> 49:36.910

Todd

52:58.210 --> 53:02.470
did Emma happen to mention to you that
she's engaged to marry we are not

53:02.470 --> 53:03.848
engaged

53:03.849 --> 53:14.260

53:15.339 --> 53:18.339
ok enough you think

53:24.320 --> 53:29.090

53:49.760 --> 53:57.020
we might be none of my business but
would you mind explaining what happened

53:58.220 --> 54:03.950
Todd's not a bad guy was just hurt that
makes a man crazy sometimes

54:05.750 --> 54:08.750
so you actually went down with that guy

54:10.050 --> 54:13.050
I did we grew up together

54:14.789 --> 54:18.449
when you live in a small town like this
you'll find their own a lot of

54:18.449 --> 54:24.119
efficiency so settling becomes a real
thing

54:25.739 --> 54:28.739
Emma teehee yourself I know

54:33.790 --> 54:37.150
yes

54:38.850 --> 54:44.310
after a while you realize that no one's
gonna show up on a white horse and sweep

54:44.310 --> 54:46.200
you off your feet

54:46.200 --> 54:49.200
there is no prince charming

55:00.950 --> 55:03.950
yeah

55:07.450 --> 55:10.450
first has do come true sometimes

55:13.650 --> 55:17.819

decisions to make

55:19.610 --> 55:24.080
Palace think i'm gonna make them there's
no Russian you have everything going for

55:24.080 --> 55:26.720

make a decision now that you're gonna

55:26.720 --> 55:31.549

blabbermouth and you are capable of so
much and when he talking about certainly

56:10.640 --> 56:13.490
what I can think is that world out there
we'll never get to see what you have to

56:13.490 --> 56:16.490
offer

56:17.690 --> 56:22.609
I valises college fees to think about my
parents mortgage to pay off a failing

56:22.609 --> 56:29.029

dream anymore is not about that

56:32.780 --> 56:35.780

thinking about what you said you're

you into it

hold on Prince whatever happened just
passing through and going where fate

57:58.890 --> 58:03.930

58:03.930 --> 58:06.690
one who said i might appreciate a little
more help

58:06.690 --> 58:10.560

gift card for massage or something

58:11.550 --> 58:15.180

more specific well it sounds like things

58:15.180 --> 58:21.330

that I didn't love I came here to escape
all of that keep I never expected to

01:09:50.198 --> 01:09:53.738

planning a royal wedding understand like
this

01:10:47.119 --> 01:10:53.719
how foolish do I look now two men in my
life and the honest one turns out to be

01:10:53.719 --> 01:10:55.369
the used car salesman

01:10:55.369 --> 01:10:58.369
what are the chances

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:08.920
I think you should leave because we
really want

quite

Jeffrey your closet back at the palace
is bigger than this

01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:13.490

spun using cash was good idea

01:12:14.210 --> 01:12:20.540
thankfully rental car with credit card
not so much but there's no way if I have

01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:25.850
been keeping up and for the record he's
been very supported he understands you

01:12:25.850 --> 01:12:30.260
better than you think Duncan I'm sorry
about the young lady she seems very nice

01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:33.260
you know about that too

01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:38.480
come on maybe I think it's time we got

01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:45.860
you might be right

01:12:49.920 --> 01:13:31.170
good news is we were able to get
everything back on track

01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:36.030
Johnny yeah I what about the guests

01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:40.949

politicians and the American president

01:13:40.949 --> 01:13:44.759
ended up booking golf holiday instead
but for the most part we're all set

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:50.100
and best of all our ratings are off the
chart

01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:54.780
Oh a slit let's say you Duncan

01:13:54.780 --> 01:14:04.380

exactly rude entitled and I was happy in
aurora and people like me not because of

01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:09.790

Duncan's right Arianna we've been
fortunate but we can't expect him to be

01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:34.340
happy just because we are sometimes we
have to listen to our hearts
