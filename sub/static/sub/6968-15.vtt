00:24.233 --> 00:26.360
Your turn.

00:32.241 --> 00:34.326
Jack?

00:42.084 --> 00:43.836
Honey?

00:43.961 --> 00:46.547
Are you still feeling sick?

00:50.008 --> 00:54.513
What's the matter with you?
Can't you hear the baby is crying?

01:04.313 --> 01:07.025
How about some cereal, honey?

01:24.001 --> 01:28.463
You were having those awful
dreams again last night.

01:28.630 --> 01:31.300
I didn't sleep long enough to be dreaming.

01:31.425 --> 01:35.637
I want you to go to the doctor.
Find out what's wrong.

01:39.433 --> 01:43.437
- Will you do that?
- I'd just like to eat my breakfast in peace!

01:43.896 --> 01:46.440
Do you think that's possible?

02:02.206 --> 02:03.999
Jack! What is it?!

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
<font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font> Season 2
Episode 15 - Fresh Bones

03:53.358 --> 03:58.488
Private John McAlpin.
One of the few, the proud, but dead.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.700
He wrapped his car around a tree.
He died on impact.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.828
Drug and alcohol tests came back negative.

04:04.912 --> 04:08.290
The car shows no evidence
of mechanical failure.

04:08.373 --> 04:13.295
The military is calling it a suicide.
It's the second one in as many weeks.

04:13.378 --> 04:18.175
- Both at the same base?
- Yeah, except it's not exactly a base.

04:18.300 --> 04:22.596
The Marines were stationed at the
Folkstone Processing Center, North Carolina.

04:22.679 --> 04:26.099
More than 12,000 refugees waiting
for asylum from Uncle Sam.

04:26.183 --> 04:30.896
- Wasn't there a riot there a month ago?
- Yeah. A ten-year-old boy was killed.

04:30.979 --> 04:34.733
- Details of his death were never released.
- Why did the military contact us?

04:34.983 --> 04:38.362
They didn't. Mrs McAlpin
contacted the Bureau...

04:38.445 --> 04:42.574
...when the military refused to investigate
her husband's death further.

04:42.658 --> 04:45.077
She doesn't believe it was suicide.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.745
There.

04:59.091 --> 05:03.262
This is the tree that stopped
Private McAlpin's car.

05:06.306 --> 05:11.478
The state police reported
there was graffiti on the bark.

05:12.896 --> 05:15.524
Looks like some kind of ritual symbol.

05:15.607 --> 05:19.236
Most of the refugees at Folkstone are Haitian.

05:19.987 --> 05:23.824
Mrs McAlpin believes voodoo
was behind her husband's death?

05:23.907 --> 05:29.288
Mrs McAlpin doesn't believe her husband
killed himself. She wants to know who did.

05:37.796 --> 05:40.299
Jack used to tell these jokes.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.803
Well, they were pretty dumb, I guess.

05:44.887 --> 05:47.890
But the way he told them
always made me laugh.

05:48.182 --> 05:53.312
Then he got transferred to the camp,
and nothing was very funny any more.

05:53.395 --> 05:57.566
Did he ever discuss what went on there?
What his duties included?

05:57.733 --> 06:00.444
No. He'd just come home angry.

06:01.320 --> 06:04.698
Mostly at himself, though sometimes
he'd turn it on Luke and me.

06:04.781 --> 06:08.243
Was he ever treated for depression or stress?

06:08.327 --> 06:13.290
No. I tried getting him to talk
to someone... even our minister.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.793
But Jack believed in dealing
with his own problems.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.129
Did he believe in voodoo?

06:19.213 --> 06:24.218
The Marines, his family and football
sums up everything Jack believed in.

06:24.676 --> 06:30.557
So when did you first think that his death
involved something out of the ordinary?

06:32.142 --> 06:37.689
One of the boys in his squad...
told me what they found at the accident.

06:39.566 --> 06:43.111
And he said it was some
kind of voodoo curse.

06:45.280 --> 06:50.786
The same one they found on the stool
that Puerto Rican boy used to hang himself.

06:50.869 --> 06:54.248
- Who told you that?
- Harry Dunham.

06:55.874 --> 07:00.212
He's from New Orleans, so he's
superstitious about that type of thing.

07:00.295 --> 07:01.505
What about you?

07:01.839 --> 07:07.469
My husband had just died, so I didn't
give it much thought either way.

07:07.553 --> 07:11.682
Not until Luke dug this up out of his
sandbox.

07:21.441 --> 07:24.570
I know it sounds crazy,
me worrying about all this.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.615
The truth is I'm scared.

07:28.907 --> 07:31.410
I'm scared for my child...

07:32.786 --> 07:36.665
...and I just don't know what to do any more.

08:46.401 --> 08:49.321
It's down there on the right, sir.

08:54.785 --> 08:57.412
(man speaks Haitian)

08:57.496 --> 09:01.333
Va tu! Va tu! Go! Go! Go away!
Get out of here! Go! Go!

09:01.416 --> 09:03.669
Away! Go! Go!

09:03.752 --> 09:06.547
He's crazy. Too much rum.

09:07.256 --> 09:11.718
For such a pretty lady,
it is dangerous out here.

09:11.802 --> 09:14.847
You need something pour vous garder.

09:14.972 --> 09:17.224
For protection.

09:18.267 --> 09:21.603
- Your lucky charm.
- Come on, Mulder.

09:21.687 --> 09:23.564
- How much?
- Five. I mean ten.

09:23.647 --> 09:26.066
I'll give you five.

09:26.441 --> 09:28.402
- OK.
- Let's go, Mulder.

09:28.485 --> 09:32.656
You should always carry protection.
There you go.

09:39.162 --> 09:43.000
I'm still not clear just what it is
you're investigating here.

09:43.083 --> 09:47.087
Two of your men have died in two weeks,
allegedly of self-inflicted injuries.

09:47.171 --> 09:50.007
I've taken every measure
to see it doesn't happen again.

09:50.090 --> 09:55.846
I've even flown in the 528th Combat Stress
Control Detachment from Camp Lejeune.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.557
But your soldiers aren't in combat.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.143
What we're dealing with here is worse.

10:01.226 --> 10:02.728
How so?

10:02.811 --> 10:05.689
We're soldiers. We're not prison guards.

10:05.772 --> 10:09.109
We're policing a hostile
population of foreigners...

10:09.193 --> 10:14.156
...without the resources to feed or house
them. There are bound to be some conflicts.

10:14.406 --> 10:17.451
So your men bear the brunt
of the refugees' frustration?

10:17.534 --> 10:20.621
It's hatred, plain and simple.

10:20.704 --> 10:22.789
They hate us.

10:22.915 --> 10:29.379
And all I can do is... see that they're
processed as efficiently as possible.

10:29.463 --> 10:35.177
Colonel Wharton, a, uh... certain ritual sign
was found at the scene of both deaths.

10:35.260 --> 10:38.680
- Is there anything you can tell us about that?
- Not much.

10:38.764 --> 10:42.017
Apparently it's some sort of voodoo marking.

10:42.100 --> 10:45.687
But you haven't investigated it
as a possibility?

10:45.771 --> 10:48.315
Possibility of what?

10:49.816 --> 10:53.445
All I know is voodoo caused
a riot in my camp.

10:54.530 --> 10:58.617
One night they held some secret ceremony.
The next day all hell broke loose.

10:58.700 --> 11:02.412
We understand a refugee
was killed. A young boy.

11:02.496 --> 11:05.499
No one felt that tragedy more deeply than me.

11:05.582 --> 11:10.003
I was able to isolate the one responsible
for instigating all the trouble.

11:10.295 --> 11:15.008
- Who would that be?
- His name is Bauvais. Pierre Bauvais.

11:15.634 --> 11:20.889
- Thinks he's some kind of revolutionary.
- Do you think we could speak with him?

11:20.973 --> 11:24.560
If you don't mind listening to
his laundry list of complaints.

11:24.643 --> 11:29.773
I'd also like to examine Private McAlpin's
body. I have a signed consent from his wife.

11:29.857 --> 11:34.403
Private Dunham will help you both
with whatever you need.

11:49.626 --> 11:53.922
Cause of death was no great mystery.
That boy was doing 60 when he hit the tree.

11:54.006 --> 11:58.510
- So they pronounced him at the scene?
- His head was hanging like a broken peony.

11:58.594 --> 12:01.305
And he had no cardiac functioning.

12:01.388 --> 12:06.935
I saw no reason to conduct an autopsy then
and I still don't. You can see for yourself.

12:10.022 --> 12:12.441
What kind of a sick joke is this?

12:12.524 --> 12:15.527
Jackson! Who the hell's been in here?

12:15.611 --> 12:20.240
Someone's tampered with McAlpin's
body, and I wanna know who!

12:21.825 --> 12:23.952
- You're Harry Dunham.
- Yes, sir.

12:24.036 --> 12:26.038
You knew Private McAlpin.

12:26.371 --> 12:28.790
His wife said you were friends.

12:29.291 --> 12:31.502
We were in the same squad.

12:31.585 --> 12:34.713
Any idea why he might've killed himself?

12:35.589 --> 12:37.674
I can't say, sir.

12:37.966 --> 12:40.427
Can't say, or you won't say?

12:42.971 --> 12:45.933
I'll be right here if you need me.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.692
My name is Mulder. I'm with the FBI.

12:55.984 --> 13:00.781
I was hoping you could answer questions
about the Marines who took their own lives.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.953
It is a terrible shame.

13:07.663 --> 13:10.791
I'm not convinced it's as simple as that.

13:10.874 --> 13:15.003
You do not believe I was
involved in this, do you?

13:16.338 --> 13:18.507
How could I be...

13:18.590 --> 13:21.760
...when they keep me locked up in here.

13:21.844 --> 13:24.179
You tell me.

13:24.263 --> 13:28.684
These photographs were taken
at the sites of both deaths.

13:28.767 --> 13:31.979
The shell was found buried under
one of the soldiers' homes.

13:32.354 --> 13:34.982
Can you tell me about the symbol?

13:36.817 --> 13:38.777
Why?

13:38.861 --> 13:42.030
What do you expect to learn from this?

13:42.114 --> 13:44.241
Just the truth.

13:44.324 --> 13:48.370
One of the Marines left behind a wife.
She's too frightened to even mourn.

13:48.453 --> 13:51.164
She deserves some peace of mind.

13:53.292 --> 13:56.044
It is the loco-miroir...

13:56.795 --> 14:00.174
...the crossroads between the two worlds.

14:01.550 --> 14:06.430
The mirror in which a man
must confront his true self.

14:07.181 --> 14:10.142
These... Marines...

14:10.851 --> 14:13.520
...maybe they did not like what they saw.

14:13.854 --> 14:18.734
Colonel Wharton says you
incited the riot last month.

14:19.234 --> 14:22.362
My country was born on the blood of slaves.

14:23.280 --> 14:26.283
Freedom is our most sacred legacy.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.578
Does that mean you'd kill to preserve it?

14:31.163 --> 14:35.083
Wharton will not let us return home.

14:36.293 --> 14:38.712
Which is all we ask.

14:38.795 --> 14:41.465
Mulder, I need to speak with you.

14:41.548 --> 14:45.636
She's come to tell you... the Marine is gone.

14:46.970 --> 14:50.307
- How did you know?
- It's the spirits.

14:51.475 --> 14:53.644
Loa have warned you.

14:54.269 --> 14:58.273
Somebody stole McAlpin's body
and replaced it with a dog's corpse.

14:58.357 --> 15:01.360
They will only warn you once.

15:01.652 --> 15:06.281
After that, no magic can save you.

15:06.740 --> 15:09.493
Come on, Scully. Let's go.

15:22.756 --> 15:25.467
What do you think happened
to Private McAlpin?

15:25.551 --> 15:28.345
Bauvais must've switched the bodies.

15:28.428 --> 15:32.891
- But he's been confined for the last month.
- Then he had somebody else do it.

15:32.975 --> 15:36.812
You said there was no evidence.
And security's impossible to breach.

15:36.895 --> 15:39.731
Whoever did it was clever and thorough.

15:39.815 --> 15:43.235
I wasn't suggesting that
some kind of spirit did it.

15:44.403 --> 15:48.407
Well, just in case,
I believe in covering my bases.

15:48.490 --> 15:52.202
Mulder, voodoo only works
by instilling fear in its believers.

15:52.286 --> 15:55.163
You saw how Bauvais tried to intimidate me.

15:55.247 --> 15:59.001
I'll admit the power of suggestion
is considerable, but...

15:59.084 --> 16:02.296
...this is no more magic
than a pair of fuzzy dice.

16:02.754 --> 16:05.340
Scully, look out!

16:12.264 --> 16:13.515
Hey!

16:16.310 --> 16:18.145
Private McAlpin?

16:26.028 --> 16:29.948
He's non-verbal... non-responsive
to voice, touch or pain.

16:30.032 --> 16:34.703
The neurologists suspect he suffered a
severe concussion, resulting in amnesia.

16:34.786 --> 16:38.707
A plausible diagnosis. Only I'm more
interested in how he came back to life.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.959
Well, obviously, he never left.

16:41.043 --> 16:46.298
Dr Foyle made a gross mistake
when he signed the death certificate.

16:46.381 --> 16:49.510
- Did you get a copy of the blood test?
- Yeah.

16:52.179 --> 16:55.599
Electrolytes, white and red
counts are all normal.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.476
Except this is strange.

16:57.559 --> 17:02.231
The lab detected trace levels
of tetrodotoxin in his blood.

17:02.314 --> 17:07.569
That's a poison found in the reproductive
organs of puffer fish, a Japanese delicacy.

17:07.653 --> 17:12.115
Only I get the feeling that Private McAlpin
didn't frequent many sushi bars.

17:12.199 --> 17:16.244
- You have a theory how it got in his blood?
- What do you know about zombies?

17:16.411 --> 17:19.623
I hope you don't tell Robin McAlpin
that she married one.

17:19.705 --> 17:23.210
In 1982 a Harvard ethnobotanist
named Wade Davis...

17:23.292 --> 17:27.422
...did extensive field research in Haiti
on the zombification phenomenon.

17:27.506 --> 17:31.718
He analysed several samples of zombie
powder prepared by voodoo priests.

17:31.885 --> 17:36.139
- He found tetrodotoxin in all of them.
- Mulder, it's a lethal poison.

17:36.223 --> 17:41.520
Small doses can depress cardiorespiratory
activities to such a low level...

17:41.603 --> 17:44.022
...that the victim appears clinically dead.

17:44.106 --> 17:47.776
- Zombie or not, Jack McAlpin is alive.
- Exactly.

17:47.860 --> 17:53.782
Which is what makes me wonder about the
other Marine who allegedly killed himself.

18:06.420 --> 18:09.423
Why would they bury Private Guttierez here?

18:17.890 --> 18:20.100
They beat you to it.

18:20.517 --> 18:23.061
You're the FBI, aren't ya?

18:23.187 --> 18:24.855
Yeah.

18:24.938 --> 18:29.693
We've arranged to exhume
the body of Manuel Guttierez.

18:30.485 --> 18:34.072
I prepared the dig as soon as
I got the order, but it's too late.

18:34.156 --> 18:37.868
- Too late?
- Yeah, the body snatchers got there first.

18:37.951 --> 18:43.665
I caught 'em a few times right in the act,
but... it's gettin' I can't keep up any more.

18:43.749 --> 18:46.627
That's, uh... why I got this.

18:49.046 --> 18:50.923
Don't the police intervene?

18:51.006 --> 18:54.551
They got their hands full
just tryin' to protect the living.

18:54.635 --> 18:58.347
I'm all these people have
to preserve their rest.

18:58.430 --> 19:01.475
These body snatchers,
what do they do with the bodies?

19:01.558 --> 19:04.228
- They sell 'em.
- To who?

19:04.311 --> 19:09.316
Well, it varies. When the local medical
school ran short of cadavers...

19:09.399 --> 19:12.694
...rumour had it that the
snatchers got $200 a head.

19:12.778 --> 19:16.448
But mostly it's the voodoo
types who do the buying.

19:17.324 --> 19:20.827
A lot of folks in these parts go in for that...

19:20.911 --> 19:24.122
...with the medicines and the potions and...

19:24.206 --> 19:26.124
Here we are.

19:26.208 --> 19:29.920
Look at that. They dug him up
right under my nose.

19:30.003 --> 19:33.340
How's he supposed to rest in peace like this?

19:35.300 --> 19:39.596
They can do what they like
with the pigs and the chickens.

19:39.680 --> 19:42.182
But this is a desecration.

19:42.266 --> 19:43.976
This is uncool.

19:44.059 --> 19:46.144
Mulder...

19:47.062 --> 19:50.524
Look at that. See what I'm talking about?

19:51.149 --> 19:53.652
Let us take care of this.

19:54.820 --> 19:56.655
Knock yourselves out.

19:56.738 --> 19:58.365
Hey!

19:59.157 --> 20:02.452
Let me be! I didn't do nothing!
What did I do?!

20:02.536 --> 20:04.872
- Maybe you can tell us.
- Let me be!

20:13.297 --> 20:17.384
Maybe I should kiss a few
and find out if one is Guttierez.

20:21.763 --> 20:23.974
Fresh bones. They pay good.

20:26.643 --> 20:31.648
But I go there for the frogs.
You find the best frogs at the cemetery.

20:32.524 --> 20:35.027
How do you get out of the camp?

20:35.861 --> 20:37.988
I go and then I come back.

20:38.113 --> 20:42.075
What about your parents?
Are your parents at the camp?

20:42.159 --> 20:44.661
What about a name?

20:47.623 --> 20:49.750
Chester Bonaparte.

20:51.043 --> 20:55.339
- What do you do with the frogs, Chester?
- For each one I catch I get 50 cents.

20:55.422 --> 21:00.844
- From who? Who pays you for them?
- Bauvais. His magic is the most strong.

21:02.221 --> 21:04.765
He even made my fries disappear!

21:05.140 --> 21:09.269
You know, Chester, I got magic, too.
And I bet I can make your fries reappear.

21:10.604 --> 21:12.064
Merci.

21:12.147 --> 21:16.109
Mulder, certain frog species secrete
a substance called bufotoxin.

21:16.193 --> 21:19.947
It's chemically similar to what
was in Private McAlpin's blood.

21:20.030 --> 21:22.950
We should ask Bauvais what
he's doing with those frogs.

21:23.033 --> 21:26.620
I didn't want to say anything,
but I think we're being followed.

21:26.703 --> 21:30.249
There's a grey four-door sedan
in the parking lot.

21:36.255 --> 21:38.715
Keep an eye on Chester.

21:52.563 --> 21:54.648
Out of the car, Private!

21:54.731 --> 21:58.110
- You've been following us.
- I had to warn you.

21:58.193 --> 22:00.320
You didn't seem interested before.

22:00.404 --> 22:04.241
I couldn't talk then, not with
Colonel Wharton so close by.

22:06.493 --> 22:08.787
And not with him right there.

22:10.747 --> 22:13.083
Chester? He's just a little boy.

22:13.166 --> 22:15.252
No, sir, he is not.

22:16.545 --> 22:20.674
- What's going on?
- He was about to tell us why we're in danger.

22:20.757 --> 22:24.136
You're putting yourselves into
something you don't understand.

22:24.219 --> 22:25.512
But you do.

22:25.596 --> 22:30.184
Bauvais warned him. He told the colonel
he'd take his men one by one unless...

22:30.517 --> 22:32.477
Unless what?

22:32.561 --> 22:37.441
Unless the colonel let his people
go back to Haiti. But the colonel...

22:37.524 --> 22:41.028
...he just had us turn up the heat
on all them beatings.

22:41.111 --> 22:46.116
- Colonel Wharton sanctioned beatings?
- He ordered it. And worse.

22:46.909 --> 22:49.703
The things he is making us
do to those people!

22:49.786 --> 22:52.289
Why hasn't anybody filed a complaint?

22:52.664 --> 22:56.710
None of us feel good about it, ma'am,
but you don't join the Marines to feel good.

22:56.793 --> 22:59.338
You said Bauvais threatened
the colonel's men.

22:59.421 --> 23:02.716
He said... he'd take their souls.

23:03.008 --> 23:04.676
And you believe he can do that?

23:04.927 --> 23:07.638
Jack was my friend.
Look what happened to him.

23:07.721 --> 23:13.519
We don't know what happened to him. But
there is an explanation for his condition.

23:14.811 --> 23:19.024
Back home, an associate of
my daddy's, Clyde Jessamin...

23:19.107 --> 23:22.569
...once crossed a man on
some kind of real-estate deal.

23:22.653 --> 23:29.409
Jessamin's daughter took ill with somethin'
the doctors couldn't make heads or tails of.

23:29.493 --> 23:33.413
All they could do was shoot her full
of morphine, the pain was so bad.

23:33.497 --> 23:37.960
She died, five minutes past
midnight, on her weddin' day.

23:38.836 --> 23:42.881
And when they did an autopsy
to try and figure it out...

23:43.215 --> 23:47.719
...all they could find was a bunch of snakes
squirming around inside her belly.

23:47.803 --> 23:52.182
- Sounds like an old wives' tale.
- No, ma'am. It's not.

23:53.308 --> 23:55.060
You see...

23:55.143 --> 23:58.480
...l'm the one who was supposed to marry her.

24:13.287 --> 24:17.332
- Think he's telling the truth?
- Until I can figure out why he'd lie, yeah.

24:17.416 --> 24:21.879
He's superstitious, and superstition
breeds fear. It's what voodoo is all about.

24:21.962 --> 24:24.840
It's as irrational as avoiding
a crack in the sidewalk.

24:24.923 --> 24:27.759
Why would he be trying to avoid Chester?

24:32.764 --> 24:34.850
Chester!

24:41.857 --> 24:43.525
Chester!

24:43.609 --> 24:45.694
Wait a second!

24:49.156 --> 24:51.158
Chester!

25:00.834 --> 25:03.295
Stop! I'm not gonna hurt you!

25:03.670 --> 25:05.214
Chester!

25:05.339 --> 25:07.174
It's OK, I'll get him.

25:20.979 --> 25:23.065
Chester!

25:27.986 --> 25:29.696
Chester?

26:09.152 --> 26:11.780
Can I get you anything else, sir?

26:11.864 --> 26:13.866
Just get the door.

26:21.707 --> 26:26.170
- I'm sorry, I'm having my breakfast.
- That's all right, we already ate.

26:32.843 --> 26:37.181
I understand you obtained a court order
yesterday to exhume Private Guttierez.

26:37.264 --> 26:38.265
That's right.

26:38.348 --> 26:41.101
I've filed a complaint with
the Justice Department.

26:41.185 --> 26:45.355
His body was missing.
Stolen from his coffin, apparently.

26:48.734 --> 26:51.445
Now you see what we're facing here.

26:54.865 --> 26:57.784
What barbaric religion
would desecrate a grave?

26:57.868 --> 27:00.329
We suspect it was an act of retaliation.

27:01.288 --> 27:02.789
Retaliation?

27:02.873 --> 27:08.045
- For your mistreatment of the detainees.
- What the hell are you talkin' about?

27:08.128 --> 27:15.135
Physical abuse of political refugees is a
prosecutable crime under international law.

27:15.219 --> 27:19.515
It's Bauvais, isn't it? He's the one
you're gettin' this garbage from.

27:19.806 --> 27:21.350
Look...

27:21.433 --> 27:26.855
...nobody ever said this was a hotel,
but it's hardly a concentration camp.

27:26.939 --> 27:32.528
- Then there is no policy of harassment?
- It's my men who are being harassed.

27:32.611 --> 27:35.072
The UN, the relief organisations...

27:35.155 --> 27:41.662
...they're all so busy protecting the rights of
refugees, nobody's looking out for my men!

27:41.745 --> 27:46.792
Well, we'll let you finish.
Don't want your breakfast to get cold.

28:11.817 --> 28:16.572
Wharton's left these people no choice but to
fight back with the only weapon they have.

28:16.655 --> 28:20.117
There's a big difference between
nasty looks and raising the dead.

28:20.200 --> 28:22.411
Not according to Private Dunham.

28:22.494 --> 28:23.704
Agh!

28:23.787 --> 28:25.873
What?

28:35.966 --> 28:37.926
More scare tactics.

28:43.557 --> 28:46.393
- Let me see that.
- Oh, it's nothing.

29:09.374 --> 29:12.002
I don't think he's in any condition to talk.

29:12.085 --> 29:15.631
That's right, Private, you don't think.
You follow orders.

29:15.714 --> 29:18.300
- But, sir...
- Dismissed!

29:32.940 --> 29:36.235
Ouvri barrière pou moi.

29:36.693 --> 29:39.279
I want the secret.

29:39.821 --> 29:43.450
Maybe you should tell me now,
while you can still talk.

29:44.326 --> 29:48.080
Ma vie nan mains Bon Dieu.

29:48.247 --> 29:50.499
No, Papaloi.

29:51.124 --> 29:54.086
Your life is in my hands.

30:35.502 --> 30:37.796
I was surprised to get your card.

30:38.213 --> 30:41.508
I'd assumed our last contact...

30:41.592 --> 30:44.344
...would be our last.

30:44.428 --> 30:46.054
Why are you here?

30:46.138 --> 30:49.099
Your investigation is faltering, Agent Mulder.

30:49.183 --> 30:52.352
We've got a renegade Marine
violating human rights...

30:52.519 --> 30:55.022
These people have no rights.

30:55.564 --> 31:00.861
In 24 hours, all access to Folkstone
will be restricted to military personnel.

31:00.944 --> 31:04.781
- No press. No third-party monitoring.
- What about Scully and me?

31:04.865 --> 31:09.036
You'll be called back to Washington
on a priority matter.

31:10.329 --> 31:13.957
They're making the camp invisible. Why?

31:14.041 --> 31:19.796
In case you haven't noticed, Agent Mulder,
the Statue of Liberty is on vacation.

31:19.880 --> 31:23.800
The new mandate says if you're
not a citizen, you'd better keep out.

31:23.884 --> 31:27.804
Well, why hold 'em up?
Why not just repatriate them?

31:29.806 --> 31:34.728
During our most recent involvement in Haiti,
three US soldiers took their own lives.

31:34.811 --> 31:37.648
Two were under
Colonel Wharton's command.

31:37.856 --> 31:41.485
Are you saying the military is
sanctioning Wharton's revenge?

31:41.568 --> 31:45.906
These are innocent civilians. Some people
in Congress might have a problem with that.

31:45.989 --> 31:49.159
By the time they get a committee together...

31:49.243 --> 31:52.955
...it'll be as if none of this ever happened.

31:58.836 --> 32:04.216
No, I've been on hold for half an hour.
I'm trying to locate a Private Dunham.

32:04.716 --> 32:06.718
Yeah.

32:14.810 --> 32:16.812
Yeah.

32:19.606 --> 32:21.108
Thanks.

32:23.861 --> 32:27.614
Mulder, I just got through
to Dunham's barracks.

32:29.157 --> 32:31.118
Mulder?

32:34.162 --> 32:36.665
Your door's unlocked.

32:39.251 --> 32:43.797
Mulder, listen to this.
Dunham's been AWOL since last night...

32:47.259 --> 32:48.969
Mulder?

32:53.056 --> 32:55.142
Oh, God!

33:04.318 --> 33:06.069
- Scully?
- Yeah.

33:06.153 --> 33:09.489
I found him wandering around
outside. You all right?

33:09.573 --> 33:11.366
Yeah.

33:11.867 --> 33:14.077
It's Dunham.

33:15.913 --> 33:17.831
When I found him...

33:19.333 --> 33:21.627
...he had this in his hand.

33:30.594 --> 33:36.225
- Do you recall leaving the hospital?
- I don't recall much of anything.

33:37.893 --> 33:40.979
Except... feeling real heavy.

33:41.063 --> 33:45.275
Like... like I'm asleep and I can't wake up.

33:45.943 --> 33:48.946
Do you remember
killing Private Dunham?

33:49.029 --> 33:54.284
All I remember is being there,
seeing him in all that blood.

33:54.409 --> 33:57.538
Why did you sign the confession?

33:59.456 --> 34:04.837
The private asked and I apprised him
of what you found at the crime scene.

34:07.756 --> 34:10.425
Who else might it have been?

34:12.427 --> 34:14.513
Colonel...

34:14.596 --> 34:17.306
...can we have a word outside?

34:23.063 --> 34:25.232
What exactly did you tell him?

34:25.315 --> 34:28.318
If you're suggesting that
I coerced Private McAlpin...

34:28.402 --> 34:31.487
I need to know that he signed
that confession voluntarily.

34:31.572 --> 34:33.532
Of course he did.

34:34.783 --> 34:39.413
Since his reappearance, has Private McAlpin
had any contact with Bauvais?

34:39.496 --> 34:41.373
Not to my knowledge.

34:41.456 --> 34:45.585
- We'd still like to speak with Bauvais.
- I'm afraid that's impossible.

34:46.460 --> 34:49.590
- Why?
- Because he's dead.

34:50.132 --> 34:54.136
Last night he... cut his wrists
with a bed spring.

34:56.179 --> 35:01.351
I'll have the report sent to your motel,
along with the private's confession.

35:01.435 --> 35:06.481
Since matters are being handled internally,
I'll assume your business here is finished.

35:14.698 --> 35:16.491
What's wrong?

35:16.575 --> 35:19.703
I'm fine. It's just a headache.

35:22.289 --> 35:23.540
Mulder.

35:29.505 --> 35:32.049
OK, Mrs McAlpin. We'll be 15 minutes.

35:33.800 --> 35:36.428
First I thought I lost him.

35:37.179 --> 35:39.765
As if that wasn't hard enough to deal with!

35:39.848 --> 35:44.645
- Now they're saying he's killed Harry.
- He said it himself. He signed the confession.

35:44.728 --> 35:49.399
I don't care. It doesn't make sense.
Jack and Harry were friends.

35:49.483 --> 35:53.946
Mrs McAlpin, you said Private Dunham
came here last night. What did he want?

35:54.029 --> 35:56.114
He was on his way to see you.

35:56.281 --> 35:58.992
- For what reason?
- He wouldn't tell me.

35:59.451 --> 36:02.538
He said if anything happened to him...

36:06.208 --> 36:08.710
...I should give this to you.

36:09.586 --> 36:12.089
He told me not to open it.

36:12.881 --> 36:16.176
Luke's been in a mood since all this started.

36:16.260 --> 36:19.388
It's almost like he knows what's going on.

36:20.389 --> 36:22.933
I'll be right back.

36:23.058 --> 36:26.061
It's OK, honey. I'm coming.

36:28.939 --> 36:30.649
That's Bauvais.

36:32.985 --> 36:34.695
And Wharton?

36:34.778 --> 36:38.240
They must've known each other
when Wharton served in Haiti.

36:39.283 --> 36:41.410
When in Rome...

37:24.161 --> 37:26.038
Mulder...

37:30.209 --> 37:35.172
Dunham and Guttierez both filed
complaints against Colonel Wharton.

37:35.255 --> 37:38.675
They both cited incidents
of abuse: dates, times...

37:38.759 --> 37:40.469
Scully...

37:41.178 --> 37:43.430
...look at this.

37:46.475 --> 37:49.102
Check out the name on the dog tags.

37:52.272 --> 37:54.316
Come with me, please.

37:54.399 --> 37:57.277
Take the light out of my eyes.

37:58.028 --> 38:01.406
- Where's Wharton?
- You'll find out soon enough.

38:01.490 --> 38:04.952
He killed Bauvais. If you know about it,
you're an accessory to murder.

38:05.035 --> 38:06.912
Shut up!

38:07.579 --> 38:12.125
Bauvais got what he deserved. After
what he did to McAlpin and Guttierez...

38:12.209 --> 38:15.921
- It wasn't Bauvais.
- What are you talking about?

38:16.004 --> 38:21.385
Those men were about to testify against
Wharton, so he stopped them before they did.

38:21.468 --> 38:24.596
If you don't believe us, look in the trunk.

38:38.151 --> 38:41.280
This is what's left of Private Guttierez.

38:46.618 --> 38:49.329
Now where's Bauvais' body?

38:52.165 --> 38:54.209
We buried him...

38:54.293 --> 38:56.378
...this afternoon...

38:57.462 --> 39:00.174
...in the municipal graveyard.

39:41.256 --> 39:43.675
Au nom des saints...

39:43.759 --> 39:45.844
...et de la lune.

39:53.894 --> 39:56.438
Au nom des saints... et de la lune.

39:57.189 --> 39:59.691
Au nom des saints et des étoiles.

40:06.281 --> 40:09.117
- What is it, Scully?
- I'm all right.

40:09.701 --> 40:13.914
- You don't look all right.
- No, I'm... I'm fine. I'll catch up with you.

40:13.997 --> 40:16.083
Just go get Wharton.

41:00.419 --> 41:03.130
(man speaks Haitian)

41:10.345 --> 41:15.475
Au nom des saints et des étoiles.
Au nom des saints et du vent.

41:15.559 --> 41:18.896
Au nom des saints et de tempête!

41:22.858 --> 41:25.152
Federal agent!

41:27.988 --> 41:29.781
Drop the knife, Wharton.

41:34.244 --> 41:36.830
Drop the knife! Do it!

41:39.416 --> 41:41.043
Agh!

41:45.255 --> 41:47.841
(Bauvais speaking Haitian)

41:50.636 --> 41:53.555
He who does evil, evil he will see.

41:58.268 --> 42:00.729
(man speaking Haitian)

42:35.514 --> 42:37.182
Mulder!

42:38.058 --> 42:40.143
Are you OK?

42:40.352 --> 42:43.313
I feel better than you look.

42:46.149 --> 42:48.527
What happened?

42:48.610 --> 42:50.904
I don't know.

43:01.540 --> 43:04.209
He's dead.

43:04.293 --> 43:06.712
Did you kill him?

43:07.462 --> 43:10.174
It was Bauvais.

43:36.575 --> 43:39.536
Here's the passenger manifest you asked for.

43:40.078 --> 43:43.123
They're petitioning to have
Bauvais returned to Haiti.

43:43.207 --> 43:45.584
Too bad it has to be in a box.

43:45.667 --> 43:48.712
- Is this a complete list?
- As far as I know.

43:48.795 --> 43:53.550
- There was a boy. Chester Bonaparte.
- Sure, Chester. Poor kid.

43:53.634 --> 43:56.428
He died six weeks ago in that riot.

44:08.190 --> 44:10.275
Move it, Wong.

44:35.843 --> 44:37.636
Aaagh! Aaagh!

44:37.719 --> 44:40.681
Aaagghhhhhh...!
