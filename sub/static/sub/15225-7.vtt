You're 11,000 feet high
in the mountains.

01:25.100 --> 01:28.367
You've brought down
your last tree

01:28.400 --> 01:31.501
and then you sense it--
that BrickHauser feeling.

01:31.534 --> 01:35.267
You're ready
for America's boldest beer.

01:35.300 --> 01:38.934
BrickHauser,
the beer as cold and bold

01:38.968 --> 01:41.601
as the mountains themselves.

You were brilliant.
It was a very good performance.

01:49.534 --> 01:51.167
Thanks, Louie.

I'm not talking about you,

01:54.000 --> 01:55.434
I'm talking about

are putting on.

( <i>all murmuring</i> )

02:00.601 --> 02:03.434
You know, the best part
about shooting that commercial

02:03.467 --> 02:05.033
was where we got to shoot it.

02:05.067 --> 02:08.734
Three days up in
the mountains--
it was just great.

02:08.767 --> 02:10.434
Ever since I finished it
I've been thinking

02:10.467 --> 02:12.434
about going back up there
and spending some time,

02:12.467 --> 02:14.133
some weekend there.

02:14.167 --> 02:15.133
Sounds good.

02:15.167 --> 02:16.801
Hey, you want to go?

02:16.834 --> 02:17.801
Hey, that sounds great.

02:17.834 --> 02:19.801
Why don't we do it this weekend?

02:19.834 --> 02:22.033
Why don't we do it
for the whole week?

02:22.067 --> 02:23.367
Huh?
Yeah.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.200
Yeah?
Just us men
against the elements.

02:25.234 --> 02:27.167
All right.
I'd like to get
some money down

02:27.200 --> 02:28.501
on the elements.

02:31.434 --> 02:33.200
Come on.
What would the two of you do

02:33.234 --> 02:35.033
up in the mountains
for a whole week?

02:35.067 --> 02:37.100
What do you mean, what would
we do up in the mountains?

02:37.133 --> 02:39.601
We'd do what everybody does
in the mountains.

02:39.634 --> 02:40.601
Like what?

02:40.634 --> 02:41.667
Mountain stuff.

02:41.701 --> 02:44.167
Hey, I'm starting
to get excited.

02:44.200 --> 02:46.467
What are we going to bring?

02:46.501 --> 02:47.501
Alex?
Huh?

02:47.534 --> 02:48.968
You got to talk
them out of this.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Me?
Yeah.

02:50.033 --> 02:51.868
Well, what would you
like me to say to them?

02:51.901 --> 02:53.033
It's winter.

02:53.067 --> 02:54.467
Do you realize
that they have

02:54.501 --> 02:56.701
absolutely no experience
in the wilderness?

02:56.734 --> 02:59.100
Do you realize how
dangerous that could be?

02:59.133 --> 03:01.534
Besides which,
they'll lose a week of work.

03:01.567 --> 03:02.534
That's right.

03:02.567 --> 03:03.701
Hey, guys...

03:03.734 --> 03:04.901
count me in.

03:04.934 --> 03:05.934
I'm going.

03:05.968 --> 03:07.901
All right.
Great.

03:07.934 --> 03:10.734
Whoo!
All right!

03:10.767 --> 03:12.734
It's kind of chilly up there
this time of year.

03:12.767 --> 03:14.334
Yeah.
So I think we got
to get a place

03:14.367 --> 03:15.567
with a heated pool.

03:15.601 --> 03:17.534
No, no. No, no.

basic, you know?

03:19.534 --> 03:21.000
I want primitive.

03:21.033 --> 03:23.167
I don't want any
electricity, telephones--

03:23.200 --> 03:24.267
no conveniences.

03:24.300 --> 03:26.267
I've got just the place.

03:26.300 --> 03:27.267
ALEX:
Where?

03:27.300 --> 03:29.868
My apartment.

03:29.901 --> 03:31.567
Jim, we were
talking about

03:31.601 --> 03:33.567
something far out.
Hey...

03:33.601 --> 03:35.300
Let me rephrase that.

03:35.334 --> 03:37.200
We were talking
about in the mountains.

03:37.234 --> 03:38.267
Oh, okay.

03:38.300 --> 03:41.434
Well, then let's just find
the place in the mountains.

03:41.467 --> 03:42.434
Great idea.

03:42.467 --> 03:43.934
Hey, you want to go, Jim?

03:43.968 --> 03:46.634
Uh... yeah.

03:46.667 --> 03:48.400
You know...

03:48.434 --> 03:50.467
I do have, uh,
some experience

03:50.501 --> 03:51.634
in these matters.

03:51.667 --> 03:53.601
I used to live in
a commune, you know.

03:53.634 --> 03:56.100
BOBBY:
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Yeah.

03:56.133 --> 03:59.033
Boy, we really roughed it.

03:59.067 --> 04:01.000
Grew our own food,

04:01.033 --> 04:03.968
churned our
own butter...

04:04.000 --> 04:06.667
eh... built our
own shelters.

04:06.701 --> 04:09.167
Anything we couldn't make
for ourselves

04:09.200 --> 04:11.767
we traded for
with another commune.

04:11.801 --> 04:14.601
I had the best years
of my life there.

04:14.634 --> 04:16.634
If it was so wonderful,
why'd you leave?

04:16.666 --> 04:20.132
Uh... they traded me...

04:21.300 --> 04:23.100
( <i>grunts</i> )

04:23.133 --> 04:26.701
for a couple of goats...

04:26.734 --> 04:29.968
and a, uh, and a Donovan album.

04:31.901 --> 04:35.334
I yearn for the
wide-open spaces.

between your ears.

04:39.634 --> 04:41.667
Well, uh, even
with Jim along,

04:41.701 --> 04:43.534
I think it might be rough.

rough, Elaine.

its most raw.

About 106 miles.

05:16.334 --> 05:17.334
106 miles?

05:17.367 --> 05:19.100
It's more like 106 miles

05:19.133 --> 05:21.434
since we left anything
resembling a road.

to go back.

from the city, boys.

what you're doing.

like that for?

in the woods.

Come on, let's get this
to the refrigerator.

07:42.367 --> 07:44.801
Would you look at us--
looking for a refrigerator.

07:44.834 --> 07:46.033
There's no electricity here.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.567
Without a refrigerator

07:48.601 --> 07:50.667
all the food's gonna go bad.

It's a lot colder
outside the cabin

10:21.934 --> 10:23.501
It's okay, Jim.

10:23.534 --> 10:25.000
It's okay, it's okay.

10:25.033 --> 10:26.501
You're in the mountains.

10:26.534 --> 10:27.667
Oh, yeah?

10:27.701 --> 10:29.000
Oh, right.

10:29.033 --> 10:31.534
Who are you?

10:31.567 --> 10:34.367
I'm your friend Alex,
Alex Rieger.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.000
We work together.

10:36.033 --> 10:38.167
Oh, oh.

10:38.200 --> 10:41.334
What are we, lumberjacks?

10:41.367 --> 10:44.467
No, we're cab drivers.

10:44.501 --> 10:47.968
Oh, I bet we don't do
much business up here.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.300
You okay?

10:49.334 --> 10:51.834
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I'm all right now.

10:51.868 --> 10:55.934
I think my brains
are beginning to warm up.

10:55.968 --> 10:57.767
I'm starving, huh?

10:57.801 --> 10:59.267
What's for breakfast?

10:59.300 --> 11:01.934
Well, I'll just go
rustle up some grub

11:01.968 --> 11:04.767
from our little old refrigerator
in the woods.

11:04.801 --> 11:07.267
Now, what would
you big lugs like?

11:07.300 --> 11:08.434
Why don't you
surprise us?

11:08.467 --> 11:10.033
I'll do that.

11:10.067 --> 11:11.067
Oh, wow.

11:11.100 --> 11:14.300
You know, I'm really starting
to feel great.

11:14.334 --> 11:17.767
I could just spend the rest
of my life up here.

11:17.801 --> 11:20.434
Something ate all our food!

11:20.467 --> 11:21.934
We're going to die.

11:21.968 --> 11:23.367
We're going to die.

11:27.100 --> 11:29.434
We're 100 miles from nowhere,
and nobody's coming

11:29.467 --> 11:31.334
up for us for a week,
and all our food is gone.
Bob...

11:31.367 --> 11:33.701
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You know what we're doing wrong?

11:33.734 --> 11:36.000
We're not thinking
like outdoorsmen.

11:36.033 --> 11:38.667
What did the pioneers do
in a situation like this?

11:38.701 --> 11:41.501
They built cities
and moved into them.

11:41.534 --> 11:42.901
Come on, now, I'm being serious.

11:42.934 --> 11:44.968
We're just going to have
to use our heads again.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.534
Yay-up.

11:46.567 --> 11:48.033
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

11:48.067 --> 11:50.400
I'm a fisherman.
I brought my
fishing tackle.

11:50.434 --> 11:51.400
I'll fish.

11:51.434 --> 11:52.634
I like fish.

11:52.667 --> 11:54.501
Hey, Tony, you can go
kill something.

11:54.534 --> 11:55.801
What are you talking about?

11:55.834 --> 11:58.667
Well, Mark Trail, he left us
his gun here, right?

11:58.701 --> 12:00.300
You can go hunt.

12:00.334 --> 12:01.567
Why me?

12:01.601 --> 12:03.267
Well, because you've
fired a gun before.

12:03.300 --> 12:04.734
You were in the service,
remember? Mmm?

12:04.767 --> 12:06.033
Oh, yeah.

12:06.067 --> 12:07.434
Okay. Uh...

12:07.467 --> 12:09.534
Hey, what am I after?

12:09.567 --> 12:12.200
Why don't you
get us some steaks?

12:12.234 --> 12:15.734
Bobby, he's not going
to hold up a supermarket.

12:15.767 --> 12:17.834
You shoot anything
you find, Tony. Anything.

12:17.868 --> 12:19.000
Okay.

12:19.033 --> 12:20.567
ALEX:
Well, I'll just get

12:20.601 --> 12:24.067
my fishing tackle ready
and I'll head for the stream.

12:24.100 --> 12:26.200
Okay. I'm going
to go forage.

12:26.234 --> 12:28.434
Hey, good idea.

12:28.467 --> 12:30.501
What does "forage" mean?

12:38.267 --> 12:39.901
Close the door!

12:39.934 --> 12:43.100
Man, it's getting cold outside.

12:43.133 --> 12:44.234
Yeah, what did you shoot?

12:44.267 --> 12:48.200
Nothing. There ain't
an animal around here.

12:48.234 --> 12:49.567
That's crazy, Tony.
This is the woods.

12:49.601 --> 12:52.434
Maybe word got out
that I'm around.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.367
Alex!

12:58.801 --> 13:00.167
BOBBY:
Well? Well?

13:00.200 --> 13:03.167
What did you catch?
What did you catch?

13:03.200 --> 13:04.567
See for yourself.

13:04.601 --> 13:06.300
Huh? Huh? Well? Huh?

13:06.334 --> 13:07.601
That the bait you used?

13:07.634 --> 13:09.434
Bait? That's my catch.

13:09.467 --> 13:12.234
Well, do they puff up
when you cook 'em?

13:12.267 --> 13:14.934
Well, it's the only kind of fish
I could find in the stream.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.701
What did you even bring
them back here for?

13:16.734 --> 13:19.200
I thought you'd be impressed
by the number I caught.

13:19.234 --> 13:21.501
This one really put up a fight.

13:22.634 --> 13:25.033
We're going to die.

13:27.367 --> 13:30.567
Isn't anybody going
to contradict me?

13:30.601 --> 13:32.067
Hey, look, guys.
It ain't that bad.

13:32.100 --> 13:34.200
I mean, tomorrow Alex
can go out and fish some more,

13:34.234 --> 13:35.267
and I'll do some hunting.

13:35.300 --> 13:36.667
I'm telling you,

13:36.701 --> 13:38.934
it's going to be a lot easier
tracking animals in the snow.

13:38.968 --> 13:40.767
The snow?

13:40.801 --> 13:41.767
Hey, Bobby,
look, it's snowing.

13:41.801 --> 13:42.801
Ain't it great?
Big flakes!

13:42.834 --> 13:44.267
ALEX:
Oh, no.

13:44.300 --> 13:47.868
Now they can take our bodies
down the mountain in a toboggan.

13:49.834 --> 13:52.434
( <i>wind whistling</i> )

14:10.100 --> 14:13.367
Somebody better fix this door.

14:13.400 --> 14:14.667
Who's hungry?

14:14.701 --> 14:17.000
You found something?

14:17.033 --> 14:18.000
Blueberries!

14:18.033 --> 14:19.000
Hurray!

14:19.033 --> 14:20.167
Oh, blueberries! Oh!

14:20.200 --> 14:22.200
Bobby, Bobby!
I don't think
they're blueberries.

14:22.234 --> 14:23.234
Sure they are.

14:23.267 --> 14:24.901
No, I mean they're
blue <i>berries,</i>

14:24.934 --> 14:26.267
but I don't think
they're blueberries.

14:26.300 --> 14:27.868
These may be
poisonous.

14:27.901 --> 14:29.133
Excuse me, Alex.

14:29.167 --> 14:31.601
I've eaten blueberries before,
and they're not poisonous.

14:31.634 --> 14:35.234
I know blueberries aren't,
but these are not blueberries.

14:35.267 --> 14:36.701
They look pretty
darn blue to me.

14:36.734 --> 14:38.067
Jim, I know
they're blue berries.

14:38.100 --> 14:40.133
What I'm saying is, they
may not be blueberries.

14:40.167 --> 14:41.434
And while all blue
berries are blue

14:41.467 --> 14:43.167
not all blue berries
are blueberries.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.400
I-I-I see.

14:45.434 --> 14:48.934
I've mistaken blue berries
for blueberries.

14:48.968 --> 14:50.667
Right.

14:50.701 --> 14:52.234
Got you, Alex.

14:54.067 --> 14:55.968
Cabin fever.

15:01.834 --> 15:05.868
I was doing fine
with my hunger for six days.

15:05.901 --> 15:09.734
I just kept telling myself
that guide's coming back Sunday.

15:09.767 --> 15:12.267
And then when he didn't
show up yesterday...

15:12.300 --> 15:14.734
Oh, my hunger
is really getting to me.

15:14.767 --> 15:15.901
Well, let me tell you something.

15:15.934 --> 15:17.334
If it's the snow
that's keeping him away

15:17.367 --> 15:20.434
it's going to be a while
before he gets here.

15:20.467 --> 15:21.434
It's really deep.

15:21.467 --> 15:22.801
Oh, my God.

15:22.834 --> 15:24.801
What if it isn't the snow?

15:24.834 --> 15:26.133
Maybe he died.

15:26.167 --> 15:28.033
Maybe he had a heart attack.

15:28.067 --> 15:30.200
That would be much too easy
a death for the guy

15:30.234 --> 15:32.434
who rented us <i>this</i> cabin.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.067
This is all your fault, Bobby.

15:37.100 --> 15:38.767
My fault?

15:38.801 --> 15:41.767
Yeah! If you would have gotten
a pineapple commercial

15:41.801 --> 15:43.834
we'd be in Hawaii now... eating!

15:43.868 --> 15:46.200
Come on, Tony, Tony,
remember our deal?

15:46.234 --> 15:48.367
No talk about
food or eating.

15:48.400 --> 15:52.367
Oh, oh. Thank God for those
minnows and blueberries.

15:52.400 --> 15:53.901
I don't think we would
have made it this far.

15:53.934 --> 15:54.934
Bobby!

15:54.968 --> 15:56.734
He didn't mean
blue berries, Alex.

15:56.767 --> 15:57.868
He meant blueberries.

15:57.901 --> 16:00.200
Ohh.

16:00.234 --> 16:01.801
What time is it?

16:01.834 --> 16:03.367
ALEX:
Why?

16:03.400 --> 16:06.701
Well, if it's 4:00, I get to
suck the fish bones again.

16:08.334 --> 16:09.934
You still got an hour.

16:11.968 --> 16:14.334
You know, Alex,
this is working.

16:14.367 --> 16:16.834
You said we shouldn't
think about food

16:16.868 --> 16:20.033
and I'm sitting over here
not thinking about food

16:20.067 --> 16:21.801
and I feel a lot better.

16:21.834 --> 16:25.801
That's good.
That's good, Jim. That's good.

16:27.033 --> 16:30.501
I'm not thinking
about cheeseburgers.

16:32.200 --> 16:35.567
I'm not thinking
about pork chops.

16:35.601 --> 16:39.167
I'm not thinking
about pot roast.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.801
I'm not thinking
about Twinkies.

16:43.934 --> 16:45.567
And I'm not thinking...

16:45.601 --> 16:47.167
Jim! Jim...
would you go out

16:47.200 --> 16:48.667
and get us some
more wood, please?

16:51.033 --> 16:53.734
I'm not thinking
about minestrone.

16:55.400 --> 16:58.267
I'm not thinking
about peas.

17:00.300 --> 17:02.667
Hey, you know something?

17:02.701 --> 17:04.233
I'm full.

17:10.968 --> 17:12.467
Hey, look.
Look, guys.

17:12.501 --> 17:14.733
We're not licked
yet, you know?

17:14.767 --> 17:15.867
We can still
try hunting.

17:15.901 --> 17:17.666
Listen, I've been out,
and I've been out,

17:17.701 --> 17:20.166
and I'm telling you there's
nothing to shoot out there.

17:20.200 --> 17:23.400
Well, that doesn't
mean you won't find
something today.

17:23.434 --> 17:24.467
Yeah, listen, we can't give up.

17:24.501 --> 17:25.467
It's a waste of time.

17:25.501 --> 17:27.300
Well, what are we going to do?

17:27.334 --> 17:29.234
Sit here and wait for dinner
to walk through the door?

17:40.667 --> 17:42.667
( <i>sucking noises</i> )

17:42.701 --> 17:44.400
Jim! Hey, Jim,
what are you doing?

17:44.434 --> 17:45.634
Huh?
What are you doing?

17:45.667 --> 17:48.567
( <i>loud sucking</i> )

17:49.868 --> 17:51.868
What are you
( <i>sucks</i> ) about?

17:51.901 --> 17:54.834
I'm going ( <i>sucks</i> )
to get his attention.

17:54.868 --> 17:57.400
Oh, you mean
the guide's back?

17:58.834 --> 18:00.667
Oh! Don't scare it away!
Don't scare it away.

18:00.701 --> 18:02.834
Oh, my gosh, it's some
kind of large animal.

18:02.868 --> 18:04.701
I think it's a big duck.

18:04.734 --> 18:06.033
It's a turkey.

18:06.067 --> 18:08.968
Ernie?
Ernie's a turkey?

18:09.000 --> 18:10.167
ALEX:
Ernie?

18:10.200 --> 18:11.434
Well, doesn't he look
like an Ernie?

18:11.467 --> 18:12.501
Let's get it!
Let's get it!

18:12.534 --> 18:14.000
Come on. Come on.

18:14.033 --> 18:15.067
BOBBY:
Come here!

18:15.100 --> 18:17.267
Hey, this is crazy!
Let's go get the gun!

18:17.300 --> 18:18.667
ALEX:
Oh, the gun!

18:20.701 --> 18:21.834
Here, Tony.
You're the hunter.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.934
Uh-uh. I been hunting
for a big ugly moose.

18:23.968 --> 18:26.033
I ain't shooting
no little birdie.

18:26.067 --> 18:27.200
Bobby?

18:27.234 --> 18:28.834
I don't want to do it, Alex.
I've never killed anything.

18:28.868 --> 18:30.100
Well, I've never killed
anything either.

18:30.133 --> 18:31.767
But you've got the gun.

18:44.701 --> 18:46.200
Oh, damn.

18:46.234 --> 18:48.667
He does look like an Ernie.

19:01.934 --> 19:03.767
Oh, boy.

19:03.801 --> 19:05.267
Mmm.

19:12.133 --> 19:13.467
( <i>Tony chuckles softly</i> )

19:16.734 --> 19:18.100
Man, I hope this
thing tastes good.

19:18.133 --> 19:20.100
I never cooked nothing
without directions before.

19:20.133 --> 19:21.801
Oh, don't worry.
It's going to
taste great.

19:21.834 --> 19:23.133
Come on, Alex,
let's eat.

19:23.167 --> 19:24.601
Come on, Alex.

19:24.634 --> 19:26.300
You couldn't help
yourself. Come on.

19:26.334 --> 19:27.934
TONY:
Come on, Alex. What
were we supposed to
do, starve?

19:27.968 --> 19:31.000
BOBBY:
Yeah. It was him or us.
Come on, come on. Eat, eat.

19:31.033 --> 19:32.501
Yeah, maybe you're right.
Right, right.

19:32.534 --> 19:33.934
Ah, come on, let's eat.
Dig in. Dig in.

19:33.968 --> 19:36.801
I think maybe
we should say grace.

19:36.834 --> 19:37.801
Are you nuts?

19:37.834 --> 19:39.267
We haven't had
a meal in a week.

19:39.300 --> 19:41.501
All the more reason
why we should give thanks.

19:41.534 --> 19:42.567
Hey, I'm eating.

19:42.601 --> 19:44.067
No, no, no, no.
Maybe he's right.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.667
Look, we waited this long,
we can wait a little longer.

19:48.267 --> 19:50.033
Go ahead, Jim.

19:52.167 --> 19:58.467
Lord, we know this bird
was one of Your miracles.

20:00.167 --> 20:03.400
No easier to create...

20:03.434 --> 20:05.467
than a billion stars

20:05.501 --> 20:08.467
or a single grain
of sand.

20:08.501 --> 20:12.467
It was a truly magnificent
creature, Your Honor.

20:12.501 --> 20:17.000
And if we hadn't gotten
so hungry,

20:17.033 --> 20:20.934
Your faithful servant
Alex here...

20:22.834 --> 20:26.033
would never
have snuck up on it

20:26.067 --> 20:27.934
and blown its brains out...

20:30.901 --> 20:35.267
But we grieve
that one of Your creatures

20:35.300 --> 20:37.667
should have been
sacrificed.

20:37.701 --> 20:42.033
Though he could not think,
he could feel.

20:42.067 --> 20:46.234
And now he will never again
walk Your good earth,

20:46.267 --> 20:48.334
smell the sweet air...

20:50.734 --> 20:54.834
experience the glory
of flying in Your heavens.

20:54.868 --> 20:59.033
Taken from him is
the precious gift of life.

20:59.067 --> 21:03.434
One small
innocent being

21:03.467 --> 21:05.300
lies here lifeless...

21:08.033 --> 21:10.767
and we are
diminished.

21:10.801 --> 21:12.767
Amen.

21:12.801 --> 21:15.033
ALL:
Amen.

21:20.634 --> 21:22.601
That's mine!

21:22.634 --> 21:24.734
Save some for me!

21:31.267 --> 21:32.834
Louie,
I'm going to go home now.

21:32.868 --> 21:35.701
So, uh, if Alex
or any of the guys calls,

21:35.734 --> 21:37.234
would you call me
at home, okay?

21:37.267 --> 21:39.100
Do you have my number?

21:39.133 --> 21:40.567
I always thought so.

21:40.601 --> 21:41.801
Louie, please.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.434
This is serious.

21:43.467 --> 21:46.100
I'm really concerned about
the guys so just knock it off.

21:46.133 --> 21:47.534
Hey, I'm concerned too.
I'm worried sick.

21:47.567 --> 21:49.067
Yeah, right.

21:49.100 --> 21:51.100
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

21:51.133 --> 21:53.234
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

21:53.267 --> 21:55.701
Sunshine Cab.

21:55.734 --> 21:56.934
Rieger?

21:56.968 --> 21:58.501
Rieger, you okay?

21:58.534 --> 22:00.167
Let me talk to him.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.701
Yeah? Oh, hang on a second.

22:01.734 --> 22:04.868
There's somebody here
who wants to talk to you.

22:04.901 --> 22:07.267
Nardo, Nardo. Come in
here and talk to him.

22:07.300 --> 22:08.667
Okay.

22:08.701 --> 22:09.968
Alex!

22:10.000 --> 22:11.434
Oh, my God!

22:11.467 --> 22:13.334
I've been so worried
about you guys!

22:13.367 --> 22:14.334
Oh, my God!

22:14.367 --> 22:18.200
What happened?
Tell me everything.

22:18.234 --> 22:19.667
Yeah?

22:19.701 --> 22:21.234
You're kidding me.

22:21.267 --> 22:22.968
Oh, my G...

22:23.000 --> 22:24.467
See, I knew it.
I knew it, I knew it.

22:24.501 --> 22:26.100
I told you guys this.

22:26.133 --> 22:30.033
So what did Bobby do?

22:30.067 --> 22:32.968
( <i>giggling</i> )

22:33.000 --> 22:34.834
I love this story!

22:34.868 --> 22:37.467
I love it, I love it,
I love it.

22:37.501 --> 22:39.801
Jim, oh, my God!

22:39.834 --> 22:41.300
This is amazing.

22:41.334 --> 22:43.334
They had to get
snow plows?

22:43.367 --> 22:44.701
I can't believe it.

22:44.734 --> 22:46.267
I just don't believe...

22:46.300 --> 22:47.901
Wait till everybody
at the garage hears this.

22:47.934 --> 22:50.267
You guys must be exhausted.

22:50.300 --> 22:52.701
My God.

22:52.734 --> 22:54.000
( <i>Elaine screams</i> )

22:54.033 --> 22:55.501
Louie!

22:55.534 --> 22:57.434
( <i>crashing</i> )

23:13.434 --> 23:16.767
Uh... hey, Rieger.

23:16.801 --> 23:18.467
How you doing there?

23:18.501 --> 23:21.067
Oh, oh, oh, Elaine?

23:21.100 --> 23:23.901
Yeah, she did seem
a little upset.

23:23.934 --> 23:26.334
What the hell did
you say to her?

23:30.534 --> 23:33.133
( <i>theme music playing</i> )

23:56.234 --> 23:57.801
