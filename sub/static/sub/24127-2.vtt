WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.375
I gotta get goin'

00:03.375 --> 00:06.875
a friend of mine

00:08.583 --> 00:11.458
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.125 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:21.083
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:27.958
we're so adventurous

00:27.958 --> 00:31.333
and again

00:31.333 --> 00:34.833
and there's nobody home

00:34.833 --> 00:38.250
to count on a friend

00:38.250 --> 00:41.750
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.833 --> 00:45.291
take me, please?

00:45.291 --> 00:48.375
I got to be there

00:50.291 --> 00:53.500
Winnie the Pooh

01:14.875 --> 01:17.208
What a lovely day for...

01:17.208 --> 01:21.458
"an every other Thursday
except when it's raining"
squished ball game.

01:27.166 --> 01:28.875
Okay, long-ears!

01:28.875 --> 01:32.333
Here comes my knuckle-under
sideways overhead curveball

01:32.333 --> 01:34.166
with a half a twist
of lemonade.

01:34.166 --> 01:37.166
Oh, I do hope Rabbit
doesn't hit it,

01:37.166 --> 01:39.500
and if he does,
I hope it doesn't hit me.

01:49.875 --> 01:53.000
Not bad, if I do say so myself.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.750
Um, Rabbit,
isn't this the part

01:55.750 --> 01:57.833
where you run
to the first base?

01:57.833 --> 02:00.333
Oh, my, Pooh Bear, it is.

02:00.333 --> 02:05.166
Jumpin' crawdaddies!
What's all the commotion about?

02:05.166 --> 02:08.875
Ahhhh!

02:18.875 --> 02:21.375
You know what I always say,

02:21.375 --> 02:24.250
you gotta watch that first step.

02:24.250 --> 02:27.750
Oh, dear, very small animals
such as myself

02:27.750 --> 02:30.875
simply weren't meant to catch
such very large squish balls.

02:30.875 --> 02:33.416
- I got it! I got it!
- Oof!

02:35.333 --> 02:38.125
Say, I got you, Piglet,
old pal.

02:38.125 --> 02:39.750
and you gotit.

02:39.750 --> 02:42.625
Why, it's a touch goal!

02:42.625 --> 02:43.875
I think.

02:48.416 --> 02:51.708
Perhaps we could play a nice
quiet game of checkers instead?

02:56.875 --> 02:59.708
What's the count,
Pooh Boy?

02:59.708 --> 03:03.250
Either that,
or a hole-in-one.

03:03.250 --> 03:04.125
A hole-in-one?

03:04.125 --> 03:05.583
Yes, it is!

03:05.583 --> 03:07.000
Piglet hit a hole-in-one.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.625
Not, it's not,
it's not, it's not!

03:09.625 --> 03:12.166
Yeah!

03:13.333 --> 03:16.458
Why, Piglet, you're safe.

03:16.458 --> 03:18.958
No! He's out, out, out
and re-out!

03:18.958 --> 03:21.708
This is a matter
for the referee to settle.

03:21.708 --> 03:23.833
But Christopher Robin
is a referee.

03:23.833 --> 03:25.708
And Christopher Robin
isn't here.

03:25.708 --> 03:28.166
Well, of course, he's here.

03:28.166 --> 03:33.000
He's always here.
Where else would he be but here?

03:33.000 --> 03:35.333
What do you know?
He's not here.

03:35.333 --> 03:39.458
That's strange.
Christopher Robin has
never missed a game before.

03:39.458 --> 03:42.958
Well, perhaps we should find him
and ask where he is.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.291
Yoo-hoo! Christopher Robin!

03:51.291 --> 03:52.750
Yoo-hoo!

03:52.750 --> 03:54.000
Hi, guys,

03:54.000 --> 03:56.208
Excuse, sir.

03:56.208 --> 03:59.125
But have you perhaps
seen Christopher Robin?

03:59.125 --> 04:01.208
He looks something
like you actually,

04:01.208 --> 04:02.458
except much younger.

04:02.458 --> 04:04.708
About so high, only higher.

04:04.708 --> 04:06.625
He's a very good friend
of ours.

04:06.625 --> 04:08.333
But I am me.

04:08.333 --> 04:10.333
I don't know who this is.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.833
But it is not
Christopher Robin.

04:12.833 --> 04:17.166
He does look a slight little bit
like Christopher Robin.

04:18.250 --> 04:20.375
This imposter's preposterous.

04:20.375 --> 04:23.083
No, really, guys, it's me.

04:23.083 --> 04:25.000
What's the matter
Christopher Robin?

04:25.000 --> 04:27.708
Disguising yourself
so nobody'll recognize you?

04:27.708 --> 04:29.250
Hiding out from robbers
or something?

04:29.250 --> 04:31.625
It's because of this.

04:31.625 --> 04:33.708
Oh, my, one of these?

04:33.708 --> 04:36.000
Gasp! Not one of them.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
Oh, dear.
It is one of those.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.875
And what exactly is it?

04:40.875 --> 04:44.583
It's an invitation to party
from a girl.

04:44.583 --> 04:47.000
How wonderful!

04:47.000 --> 04:51.708
But you don't seem as happy
as it seems you should seem.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.375
I'm not happy, Pooh.

04:53.375 --> 04:56.291
'Cause this is a form
of grown-up kind of party.

04:56.291 --> 04:58.708
You have to wear a suit
and a tie,

04:58.708 --> 05:00.875
and sit up straight
and be polite.

05:00.875 --> 05:01.875
Yuck!

05:01.875 --> 05:04.875
And there'll be girls there.

05:04.875 --> 05:07.291
Oh, I don't wanna go.

05:07.291 --> 05:09.458
Don't worry,
Christopher Robin.

05:09.458 --> 05:11.458
I got the answer
to your problems.

05:11.458 --> 05:13.208
Don't go.

05:13.208 --> 05:14.958
But I have to.

05:14.958 --> 05:16.583
Mom said so.

05:16.583 --> 05:19.750
- I feel sick.
- Oh, dear.

05:19.750 --> 05:21.833
If you're sick, you really
shouldn't go out, you know.

05:21.833 --> 05:23.875
Piglet, that's it!

05:32.416 --> 05:36.458
Stand back! Somebody give him
artificial perspiration!

05:36.458 --> 05:38.750
This is perfect!

05:38.750 --> 05:40.125
Let's see.

05:40.125 --> 05:43.416
The last time I was sick,
I had poising ivy.

05:43.416 --> 05:46.583
I remember there was
a lot of scratching.

05:46.583 --> 05:49.291
Weren't there also spots?

05:49.291 --> 05:51.583
You're right.
Lots of spots.

05:55.291 --> 05:57.583
Never fear, spots is here.

06:01.333 --> 06:03.875
A little dab of this.

06:03.875 --> 06:07.375
Maybe just a "squidge"
of that.

06:07.375 --> 06:11.083
This is a very
"scientifical" process.

06:11.083 --> 06:13.375
Is it real? Or is it isn't?

06:13.375 --> 06:15.458
Only his friends know for sure.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.875
Christopher Robin:
I look positively gruesome.

06:17.875 --> 06:19.458
Thanks, Tigger.

06:19.458 --> 06:22.125
I do spots almost as good
as I do stripes.

06:23.458 --> 06:25.375
Wait till Mom sees this.

06:32.375 --> 06:35.125
Well, what did your mom say?

06:35.125 --> 06:37.291
She said I still have to go,

06:37.291 --> 06:40.583
because water color spots
aren't contagious.

06:44.208 --> 06:47.291
Christopher Robin,
it would seem to me

06:47.291 --> 06:50.291
that any party must surely be
a good party.

06:50.291 --> 06:53.708
Perhaps there will be
something sweet to eat.

06:53.708 --> 06:57.500
Yes! Perhaps some carrot cake.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.750
Actually, Rabbit,
I was thinking more of honey.

07:00.750 --> 07:04.000
You don't understand.
This is a fancy party

07:04.000 --> 07:06.208
where everything
has to be just so.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.208
And I've never been
to one of those before.

07:08.208 --> 07:10.208
Why, is that all it it?

07:10.208 --> 07:13.375
Instruction in the social graces
is a specialty of mine.

07:15.416 --> 07:19.083
I can teach you to be
a perfectly proper
gentleman in no time.

07:19.083 --> 07:23.166
Posture, posture.
One must always sit up straight.

07:23.166 --> 07:25.083
Christopher Robin.

07:25.083 --> 07:28.583
Tigger, you may begin
the conversation.

07:28.583 --> 07:30.458
Oh, Poohington...

07:30.458 --> 07:34.500
- That's you, Pooh Bear.
- Oh.

07:36.625 --> 07:39.291
Um, yes, Tiggerington.

07:39.291 --> 07:40.875
Cooking, anyone?

07:40.875 --> 07:42.875
Oh, boy! Chow time!

07:44.458 --> 07:46.583
Gentlemen take only one cookie.

07:48.375 --> 07:50.375
It's a good thing I'm on a diet.

07:50.375 --> 07:53.708
- Tea, Pooh?
- Oh, just a drop...

07:53.708 --> 07:56.583
- if you please.
- Pooh Bear!

07:58.708 --> 08:00.708
One lump or two, Tigger?

08:00.708 --> 08:02.583
- Make it 50.
- Tigger!

08:02.583 --> 08:04.208
Where are your manners?

08:04.208 --> 08:06.125
Must have left them
in my other suit.

08:08.875 --> 08:11.083
No, no, no!

08:11.083 --> 08:14.375
Proper gentlemen drink
with the pinkie extended

08:14.375 --> 08:16.125
like so.

08:16.125 --> 08:18.291
Now you may pass
the milk, Tigger.

08:18.291 --> 08:20.875
Why certainly.
Go out long, Piglet!

08:20.875 --> 08:23.750
- Tigger, no!
- It's okay being a proper
gentleman, bunny boy,

08:23.750 --> 08:27.708
But there's no use
being stuffy about it.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.458
Rabbit: Tigger, no!
Pooh, no!

08:29.458 --> 08:30.708
Everybody stop!

08:33.125 --> 08:35.708
Perhaps we should move on
to the next lesson.

08:36.958 --> 08:38.458
Christopher Robin:
But Rabbit,

08:38.458 --> 08:40.125
this is the worst part
of the whole thing.

08:40.125 --> 08:42.958
You see, I-- I can't dance.

08:42.958 --> 08:45.625
It's like I have two left feet.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.583
Two left feetsies?

08:47.583 --> 08:49.750
How do you tell
your socks apart?

08:49.750 --> 08:52.875
How can I go to this party
and dance with girls

08:52.875 --> 08:54.458
if I can't dance?

08:54.458 --> 08:59.000
Why, Christopher Robin,
I can teach you to dance.

09:00.583 --> 09:03.500
Or I could,
if I knew how.

09:03.500 --> 09:04.875
Well, I know how!

09:04.875 --> 09:07.166
I'm a regular dancing fool!

09:07.166 --> 09:10.208
Don't move.
I'll be right back.

09:13.583 --> 09:17.208
Hmm, used to be a muddy puddle
around here somewheres.

09:19.625 --> 09:20.708
Ta-da!

09:23.375 --> 09:26.625
Just what the dancing
doctor ordered.

09:28.458 --> 09:30.500
A little fancy footwork, and...

09:32.416 --> 09:34.166
...just follow
the footie-steps.

09:34.166 --> 09:36.208
One and two and four.

09:39.708 --> 09:42.708
Hey, I think I'm dancing.

09:42.708 --> 09:46.333
Why, Christopher Robin,
you are dancing.

09:46.333 --> 09:49.083
Yes, and very nicely, too.

09:49.083 --> 09:51.708
You're tripping
the light fantastic.

09:53.833 --> 09:56.416
You got the tripping down,

09:56.416 --> 09:58.708
but you need some work
on the fantastical.

10:00.083 --> 10:01.875
Thanks for all your help, guys.

10:01.875 --> 10:04.708
Now I won't feel
so shy around girls.

10:04.708 --> 10:07.875
Oh, think nothing of it,
Christopher Robin.

10:07.875 --> 10:10.875
I'm sure we shall have
a wonderful time.

10:10.875 --> 10:12.875
But, guys...

10:12.875 --> 10:14.583
What's wrong,
Christopher Robin?

10:14.583 --> 10:17.458
I'm afraid you can't go
with me?

10:17.458 --> 10:20.583
You see, the invitation
is addressed to me.

10:20.583 --> 10:23.500
I wish I could take you
with me, but I can't.

10:24.708 --> 10:27.458
He's gone...

10:27.458 --> 10:29.291
without us.

10:29.291 --> 10:31.583
Off to his party...

10:31.583 --> 10:36.291
where he'll eat cake
and dance with girls.

10:36.291 --> 10:39.416
And have fun.

10:39.416 --> 10:41.583
With all his new friends.

10:41.583 --> 10:44.708
Yeah, he'll probably have
so much fun,

10:44.708 --> 10:47.708
we'll never see him again.

10:47.708 --> 10:49.875
And it's all our fault.

10:49.875 --> 10:51.583
Oh, bother.

10:55.458 --> 11:00.000
Piglet:
Oh, dear. We'll never see
Christopher Robin again.

11:03.875 --> 11:07.500
Pooh Bear, how can you manage
to eat at a time like this?

11:07.500 --> 11:10.833
Oh, isn't it time already?

11:10.833 --> 11:12.416
Oh, bother.

11:12.416 --> 11:15.250
Would you happen
to have more honey, Rabbit?

11:15.250 --> 11:18.875
You know what happens when
a guy starts dressing up
in suits

11:18.875 --> 11:21.250
and going to parties
with girls.

11:21.250 --> 11:25.083
Oh, no, Tigger,
I don't know what happens.

11:25.083 --> 11:27.083
Why, it's oblivious, Pooh Boy.

11:27.083 --> 11:30.333
A guy just has to get all...

11:30.333 --> 11:31.875
You tell him long-ears.

11:31.875 --> 11:34.750
It's too painful for me
to talk about.

11:34.750 --> 11:38.583
What happens is,
he turns into an adult.

11:38.583 --> 11:41.000
Oh, my!

11:41.000 --> 11:44.583
It sounds... terrible?

11:44.583 --> 11:46.875
Why, it's worser
than terrible, Pooh Boy.

11:46.875 --> 11:49.375
It's even miserably terrible.

11:49.375 --> 11:52.625
What happens to happen,
Pooh Boy, is this.

11:52.625 --> 11:56.708
First of all,
you move into a new house.

11:56.708 --> 11:58.958
Nah. It's got to be
a big old house.

12:02.125 --> 12:04.458
What? You call that big?

12:15.708 --> 12:18.000
With a 200-car garage.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.750
And a tree with a swing
and a garden full of daffodils,

12:21.750 --> 12:24.708
and a couple of pink flamingos
and a mailbox made to match.

12:26.083 --> 12:27.458
And last but not least,

12:27.458 --> 12:29.708
an off-white pickety fence.

12:33.583 --> 12:36.625
- Sweetheart, I'm home!

12:36.625 --> 12:41.166
- Hello, Christopher Robin.
- We haven't seen much
of you lately.

12:41.166 --> 12:43.500
I haven't seen much
of anything lately.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.333
Honeybunches!

12:47.875 --> 12:51.000
Playing the hard parts
is what tiggers do the best.

12:55.708 --> 12:59.750
- How was your day, dear?
- Just fine, sugar dumplin'.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.500
I did the washin',
did the ironin',

13:01.500 --> 13:03.458
painted the livin' room,
went shoppin',

13:03.458 --> 13:05.416
retiled the kitchen,
built a bookcase,

13:05.416 --> 13:08.000
and dug a swimming pool.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.500
You wanna hear
what I did after breakfast?

13:10.500 --> 13:13.375
Isn't she wonderful?

13:13.375 --> 13:15.750
Who could ask
for a happier life?

13:15.750 --> 13:18.708
Time for dinner,
sweetie pie.

13:18.708 --> 13:21.708
Did someone say dinner?

13:26.500 --> 13:30.500
How about a nice game of
squishball, Christopher Robin?

13:30.500 --> 13:33.875
Fast food!
"Speciality" of the house!

13:36.708 --> 13:39.291
Time to wash the dishes,
snookums. You dry.

13:46.083 --> 13:50.083
Christopher Robin, do you think
we might have a word with you?

13:50.083 --> 13:53.875
Sorry, Rabbit, but since
I found the girl of my dreams,

13:53.875 --> 13:56.375
I don't have much time
for my friends.

13:56.375 --> 13:59.875
My life is perfect now,
especially since--

13:59.875 --> 14:03.583
Waah! Waah!

14:03.583 --> 14:04.875
You have a baby?

14:07.708 --> 14:10.708
Yep! And it's the spittin' image
of his dad,

14:10.708 --> 14:12.458
a regular chip
off the old Robin.

14:12.458 --> 14:14.625
Gopher, you're their baby?

14:14.625 --> 14:20.125
Jumpin' crawdaddies, Tigger!
How'd I ever let you talk me
into this?

14:20.125 --> 14:23.625
He's always a little cranky
before his evening feeding.

14:23.625 --> 14:27.125
- Coochie-coochie-coochie-coo!
-

14:27.125 --> 14:28.875
Dagnabbit!

14:35.708 --> 14:40.750
Christopher Robin
will never come back,
now that he's grown up.

14:40.750 --> 14:43.458
Did you see the face
on that baby?

14:43.458 --> 14:45.583
Yuck! It's gotta be love.

14:45.583 --> 14:47.958
We've simply got to do
something.

14:47.958 --> 14:51.750
It's for our-- for Christopher
Robin's own good.

14:51.750 --> 14:53.750
But he has a wife
and a family now.

14:53.750 --> 14:55.875
He's grown up.

14:55.875 --> 14:59.708
Oh, if only we were grown up,
too.

14:59.708 --> 15:01.750
I'm sure we'd know what to do.

15:01.750 --> 15:03.833
Pooh Bear, that it!

15:03.833 --> 15:05.625
If Christopher Robin
has grown up,

15:05.625 --> 15:08.750
then we'll just have
to be grown-ups, too.

15:08.750 --> 15:11.875
But grown-ups have
such very nice houses.

15:11.875 --> 15:15.458
And none of us have
very grown-up houses.

15:15.458 --> 15:18.708
We definitely need a new one.

15:18.708 --> 15:22.208
Did I hear somebody say
new house?

15:22.208 --> 15:27.250
Just happen to have
some plans right here.

15:27.250 --> 15:32.166
It's the dream home my grand
pappy was always
dreaming of building.

15:32.166 --> 15:34.708
Why, Gopher, it's perfect.

15:34.708 --> 15:36.250
How soon can you build it?

15:36.250 --> 15:38.833
Hmm, let's see.

15:38.833 --> 15:41.375
I'll have to check
the specifications,

15:41.375 --> 15:43.583
secure the proper permits.

15:43.583 --> 15:45.458
How's a day and a half sound?

15:45.458 --> 15:47.333
It sounds wonderful.

15:47.333 --> 15:50.125
In a a day and a half,
we'll invite Christopher Robin

15:50.125 --> 15:53.166
to our grown-up house
for a grown-up party.

15:54.750 --> 15:56.166
All right, everyone,

15:56.166 --> 15:58.708
we must stay precisely
on schedule,

15:58.708 --> 16:00.875
if we're to be ready
for the party.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.500
- Tigger!
- What do you want, bunny boy?

16:06.500 --> 16:10.500
I want you to take this
invitation to Christopher Robin.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.250
Do you think you can do that?

16:12.250 --> 16:14.083
Sure thing, long-ears.

16:16.583 --> 16:19.583
Neither rainin' nor sleetin'
nor sick of smog

16:19.583 --> 16:22.750
shall keep me from delivering
this invitation

16:22.750 --> 16:24.708
to its disappointed round!

16:24.708 --> 16:27.291
Whatever you do,
just be quick about it.

16:35.500 --> 16:38.500
I made it.

16:40.708 --> 16:43.458
Oh, dear!

16:54.333 --> 16:55.958
Pooh Bear,
what do you think
you're doing?

16:55.958 --> 16:58.458
Why, I'm building a wall,
Rabbit.

16:58.458 --> 17:00.583
But you should be using cement!

17:00.583 --> 17:04.875
Yes, I know.
But honey is so much tastier.

17:04.875 --> 17:06.291
Watch out!

17:12.083 --> 17:15.333
I hope this house is finished
before I am.

17:18.083 --> 17:20.875
Like my grand pappy used to say,

17:20.875 --> 17:23.875
you can't rush
quality craftsmanship.

17:23.875 --> 17:26.416
And now if we're going
to have a truly grown-up party

17:26.416 --> 17:28.000
in a truly grown-up house,

17:28.000 --> 17:31.583
we simply must have
at least one girl present.

17:31.583 --> 17:34.750
So run along, you two,
and find us a girl.

17:34.750 --> 17:38.333
But Rabbit, wherever shall we
find one of those?

17:38.333 --> 17:42.500
Well, must I think
of everything for you?

17:50.625 --> 17:52.708
Tigger, what are you doing?

17:52.708 --> 17:56.125
I'm doing the landscaping,
bunny boy.

17:56.125 --> 17:59.000
You know, flowers and grass
and such as that.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.833
The proper landscaping
of a lawn takes great care.

18:02.833 --> 18:04.750
And the hands of
a skilled gardner who--

18:04.750 --> 18:07.333
who-- who-- Yes.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.375
Well, keep up
the good work, Tigger.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.875
Do you see anything which looks
rather like a girl, Piglet?

18:16.875 --> 18:20.708
Well, Pooh, when the light
hits it just a certain way--

18:20.708 --> 18:23.500
Why, yes, I think
you're right, Piglet.

18:23.500 --> 18:26.166
Actually, that looks somewhat
like a girl, doesn't it?

18:28.000 --> 18:31.416
Rabbit: Tigger? Gopher?
What are you doing now?

18:31.416 --> 18:34.166
What's it look like
we're doing?

18:34.166 --> 18:36.625
We're putting the roof
on the garage.

18:36.625 --> 18:40.458
Yes, but shouldn't you build
the garage first?

18:40.458 --> 18:43.125
I knew we forgot something!

18:49.250 --> 18:51.708
Piglet: Do you think it
looks like a girl, Pooh?

18:51.708 --> 18:55.083
Yes, Piglet.
I think it certainly does,

18:55.083 --> 18:59.500
though I can't recall
if I have ever actually
seen a girl before.

19:10.125 --> 19:12.750
It seems the crows
are shy around girls--

19:14.125 --> 19:15.875
...just like
Christopher Robin.

19:17.583 --> 19:20.083
Gopher, why isn't
that chimney finished yet?

19:20.083 --> 19:23.333
Do you want quality
craftsmanship

19:23.333 --> 19:25.875
or slap-dash construction?

19:25.875 --> 19:30.250
Hello, Rabbit.
Will you come meet
the girl we found?

19:30.250 --> 19:32.750
Pooh Bear,
I simply don't have time.

19:32.750 --> 19:35.958
There are only-- Oh, my!

19:35.958 --> 19:38.416
There are only 15 more minutes
until the party!

19:38.416 --> 19:42.083
Gopher! Tigger!
You must finish now

19:42.083 --> 19:44.291
so that we can get ready
for Christopher Robin!

19:44.291 --> 19:46.958
Just finishing
the finishing touch,
long-ears.

19:49.166 --> 19:52.458
Now, remember everyone,
we're grown-ups now,

19:52.458 --> 19:54.750
and only by acting
like grown-ups

19:54.750 --> 19:57.958
can we hope to keep
Christopher Robin's friendship.

19:57.958 --> 20:00.583
So I want all of you
to be on your best

20:00.583 --> 20:02.958
and most grown-up behavior.

20:02.958 --> 20:05.583
If we're supposed
to be grown-ups,

20:05.583 --> 20:07.875
then I'm not wearing
this silly thing.

20:07.875 --> 20:09.708
Come along, now.

20:09.708 --> 20:12.500
Let's prepare for
Christopher Robin's arrival.

20:15.208 --> 20:18.625
Hello. Anyone home?

20:27.625 --> 20:29.166
Oh, bother.

20:29.166 --> 20:31.750
Rabbit: Timber!

20:41.375 --> 20:42.833
Christopher Robin:
There you all are.

20:42.833 --> 20:45.833
I got your invitation and--
What happened?

20:45.833 --> 20:49.458
It was our one chance
to get you back.

20:49.458 --> 20:50.833
And we failed.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.416
Get me back?
But I'm still here.

20:53.416 --> 20:55.625
But Christopher Robin,

20:55.625 --> 20:57.458
we thought you only wanted to be

20:57.458 --> 20:59.875
with your new grown-up friends.

20:59.875 --> 21:02.166
Just because
I had to go to a party

21:02.166 --> 21:03.708
doesn't mean
I would forget you.

21:03.708 --> 21:07.208
All that quality work
for nothing! Hah!

21:07.208 --> 21:10.875
Silly old bear,
I'll never be so grown-up

21:10.875 --> 21:13.250
that I won't have time
for my very best friends.

21:13.250 --> 21:17.250
We merely thought that,
with your new home and wife--

21:17.250 --> 21:19.250
- My wife?
- Oh, yes.

21:19.250 --> 21:20.958
I'd almost forgotten.

21:20.958 --> 21:23.125
Thank you for reminding me,
Christopher Robin.

21:25.166 --> 21:27.125
Come right this way.

21:31.708 --> 21:35.333
This, Christopher Robin,
is the guest who would
have been at the party...

21:35.333 --> 21:38.208
had there been a party.

21:38.208 --> 21:41.708
She's a girl, you know.

21:41.708 --> 21:44.375
But there's no reason
to be shy.

21:45.875 --> 21:48.708
She's very beautiful,
Pooh Bear.

21:48.708 --> 21:52.750
Well, go on, Christopher Robin.
Say hello to her.

21:52.750 --> 21:54.875
Um, how do you do?

21:54.875 --> 21:57.083
I'm very pleased to meet you.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.958
Go on, Christopher Robin.
Ask her for a dance.

22:01.750 --> 22:03.708
Would you care to dance?
