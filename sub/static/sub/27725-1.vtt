- HORSE NEIGHS

01:36.200 --> 01:38.960
The Highway Rat was a baddie.

01:38.960 --> 01:42.000
The Highway Rat was a beast.

01:43.320 --> 01:46.520
He took what he wanted and ate what he took.

01:46.520 --> 01:49.360
His life was one long feast.

01:50.480 --> 01:52.400
Eurgh!

01:52.400 --> 01:55.520
- RAT WHISTLES
- Here!

02:09.320 --> 02:11.440
Whoa!

02:15.200 --> 02:17.160
Mmm!

02:19.160 --> 02:20.720
Yeah!

02:20.720 --> 02:22.880
His teeth where sharp and yellow.

02:22.880 --> 02:25.280
His manners were rough... DUCK QUACKS

02:25.280 --> 02:27.440
..and rude.

02:36.520 --> 02:40.120
RAT CHUCKLES

02:40.120 --> 02:42.200
Yah!

02:43.720 --> 02:47.800
And the Highway Rat went riding - riding, riding!

02:47.800 --> 02:52.480
Riding along the highway - and stealing the travellers' food.

- BEE SIGHS SADLY

04:09.800 --> 04:12.000
RAT GASPS

04:20.480 --> 04:23.080
A rabbit came hopping along the road,

04:23.080 --> 04:25.640
then stopped with her paws in the air.

04:25.640 --> 04:30.120
For blocking her way was the Highway Rat, who cried out...

04:30.120 --> 04:32.200
Who goes there?

04:34.120 --> 04:36.400
- Ha!
- Ooh!

04:36.400 --> 04:39.120
Ha!

04:39.120 --> 04:41.720
Give me your pastries and puddings.

04:41.720 --> 04:44.680
Puddings? No!

04:44.680 --> 04:48.640
Ha! Give me your chocolate and cake!

04:49.680 --> 04:52.320
- Uh-uh...

Huh! Bye!

RABBIT GASPS

04:57.440 --> 04:59.160
For I am the...

04:59.160 --> 05:02.440
- rat of the highway!
- Ooh.

05:02.440 --> 05:04.800
The highway!

05:04.800 --> 05:07.040
- The highway!
- Ooh!

05:08.200 --> 05:09.920
- Oh...
- Yes!

05:11.480 --> 05:15.280
Yes, I am the rat of the highway!

05:15.280 --> 05:18.440
And whatever I want, I take.

05:18.440 --> 05:21.400
- I have no cakes...
- The rabbit replied.

05:22.520 --> 05:26.000
- I just have a bunch of...clover.
- Huh?

05:27.560 --> 05:29.520
Mmm...

05:29.520 --> 05:33.280
The Highway Rat gave a scornful look. But he ordered...

05:33.280 --> 05:34.840
Oh, hand it over!

05:34.840 --> 05:36.200
Here!

05:41.120 --> 05:44.880
This clover is bound to be tasteless.

05:44.880 --> 05:47.880
Eurgh! This clover is dull as can be!

05:51.560 --> 05:57.800
But I am the rat of the highway and this clover belongs to me!

05:57.800 --> 05:58.960
Ooh!

Ha-a-ar!

06:42.720 --> 06:44.960
Buns? Or biscuits?

06:48.040 --> 06:50.920
A squirrel came bounding along the road,

06:50.920 --> 06:53.120
then stopped with a shake and a shiver.

06:53.120 --> 06:56.280
Oh!

06:56.280 --> 06:57.880
Ah! Oh!

06:57.880 --> 07:01.360
For reining his horse was the Highway Rat, who thundered...

07:01.360 --> 07:04.960
- Stand and...
- RAT COUGHS

07:04.960 --> 07:06.640
Stand and deliver!

- He-he-he!
- Aargh!

07:18.520 --> 07:21.000
Give me your chocolate eclairs!

07:23.960 --> 07:27.120
For I am the rat of the highway.

07:27.120 --> 07:28.640
The highway!

07:28.640 --> 07:31.000
The highway! Ooh...

07:32.520 --> 07:39.040
Yes, I am the rat of the highway and the rat thief never shares!

07:40.920 --> 07:44.160
- I...I have no buns...
- The squirrel replied.

07:44.160 --> 07:47.120
- I just have a sack of nuts.
- Nuts?

07:49.880 --> 07:51.600
Argh!

07:53.680 --> 07:55.280
Aargh!

07:56.280 --> 07:57.960
Oh!

08:06.000 --> 08:08.720
The robber snatched the sack and snarled...

08:08.720 --> 08:11.280
I'll have no ifs or buts.

08:12.480 --> 08:15.560
These nuts are probably rotten.

08:17.400 --> 08:20.160
Oh, these nuts are hard as can be!

08:20.160 --> 08:22.800
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

SQUIRREL LAUGHS

08:28.760 --> 08:32.039
RAT SNARLS

08:32.039 --> 08:38.039
But I am the rat of the highway and these nuts belong to me!

08:46.160 --> 08:48.720
- Ha!
- HORSE NEIGHS

08:49.840 --> 08:51.160
Yah!

08:58.000 --> 08:59.320
Huh?

09:02.960 --> 09:05.200
Eurgh...

09:05.200 --> 09:06.360
Aargh!

09:09.160 --> 09:11.040
A-a-a-argh!

09:21.960 --> 09:24.040
Hm? Hmm...

09:25.400 --> 09:27.120
Ah!

09:27.120 --> 09:31.120
Some ants came crawling along the road...

09:31.120 --> 09:34.120
- Ha!
- ..then stopped with a somersault.

09:39.840 --> 09:44.880
For baring his teeth was The Highway Rat, who bellowed a deafening...

09:44.880 --> 09:46.840
Halt!

09:48.640 --> 09:51.480
Ha-ha! Give me your sweets and your lollies.

09:52.560 --> 09:55.800
Aargh! Give me your toffees and chews!

09:59.600 --> 10:02.840
For I am the rat of the highway!

10:05.120 --> 10:06.880
The highway!

10:06.880 --> 10:08.400
Ow!

10:21.920 --> 10:30.440
Yes, I am the rat of the highway and nobody dares to refuse.

10:30.440 --> 10:33.320
- We have no sweets!
- The ants replied.

10:33.320 --> 10:36.960
We just have this nice green leaf.

10:36.960 --> 10:42.960
- Oh, no, you don't! Not any more!
- Declared the Highway Thief.

10:42.960 --> 10:49.360
This leaf is nasty and bitter. This leaf is as thin as can be.

10:53.120 --> 10:57.480
But I am the rat of the highway

10:57.480 --> 11:01.680
and this leaf belongs to...

11:01.680 --> 11:03.800
RAT GULPS

11:03.800 --> 11:05.360

Yah! Yah!

11:39.920 --> 11:43.920
Ha! Ha-hey!

11:43.920 --> 11:45.520
Yee-hee-hee!

11:56.240 --> 11:58.120
Please!

11:59.160 --> 12:01.320
Aargh!

12:01.320 --> 12:03.920
- RAT LAUGHS
- Come on.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.880
- Boo!
- Aargh!

12:10.880 --> 12:12.840
FROG CROAKS

12:12.840 --> 12:14.880
With never a "please" or a "thank you",

12:14.880 --> 12:18.000
the Rat carried on in this way.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.960
Flies from a spider...

12:20.960 --> 12:23.120
milk from a cat...

12:27.800 --> 12:32.120
He once stole his own horse's hay! RAT LAUGHS

12:41.400 --> 12:43.640
DUCK SIGHS SOFTLY

12:47.200 --> 12:50.560
The creatures who travelled the highway

12:50.560 --> 12:52.400
grew thinner

12:52.400 --> 12:54.960
and thinner

12:54.960 --> 12:57.360
and thinner...

12:59.280 --> 13:01.840
THEY GASP

13:05.080 --> 13:09.200
..while the Highway Rat grew horribly fat.

13:13.840 --> 13:17.800
Ooh... He's eating up everyone's dinner!

13:17.800 --> 13:21.200
- ECHO:
- Dinner! Dinner! Dinner!

13:23.840 --> 13:24.920
Ooh!

13:24.920 --> 13:28.400
- ECHO:
- Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

13:30.960 --> 13:32.920
Hmm... Ah!

13:49.400 --> 13:51.480
DUCK EXHALES

13:51.480 --> 13:54.880
A duck came waddling down the road, then stopped with a...

13:54.880 --> 13:56.960
How do you do?

13:56.960 --> 13:58.240
You!

14:01.280 --> 14:03.640
He-he-he...

14:05.600 --> 14:10.440
- Pffft! I see you have nothing...
- The Rat complained.

14:10.440 --> 14:14.920
In that case, I'll have to eat...

14:14.920 --> 14:18.640
- ..YOU!
- Oh!

14:18.640 --> 14:22.080
I doubt if you're terribly juicy.

14:22.080 --> 14:26.200
Most likely, your tough as can be.

14:26.200 --> 14:30.040
But I am the rat of the...

14:30.040 --> 14:33.160
- Highway?
- The highway!

14:33.160 --> 14:35.640
- The highway!
- Yes!

14:35.640 --> 14:44.040
I am the rat of the highway and I fancy a duck for tea!

14:45.080 --> 14:47.600
- Hang on!
- Quacked the duck.

14:47.600 --> 14:52.680
For I have a sister with goodies you might prefer.

14:53.840 --> 14:59.200
I know that she'd love to meet you and I'm certain that you'd like her.

15:00.200 --> 15:07.120
For in her cave, her deep, dark cave, right at the top of the hill,

15:07.120 --> 15:10.880
are biscuits and buns aplenty!

15:10.880 --> 15:14.360
And there you may eat your fill.

15:14.360 --> 15:18.080
- Yeah! Lead on!
- Cried the Rat.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.280
Ooh!

15:22.520 --> 15:25.840
RAT GRUNTS

15:26.840 --> 15:29.480
Ha!

15:32.680 --> 15:36.480
And they took to the road - which seemed it would never end.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.400
Onwards they rode and upwards.

15:42.920 --> 15:46.120
- Here.
- Bend after bend after bend.

15:53.240 --> 15:56.440
At last, they came to a lonely cave

15:56.440 --> 15:58.760
and the duck began to quack.

15:58.760 --> 16:02.640
- She quacked...
- Good evening, sister!

16:02.640 --> 16:05.280
Sister? Sister!

16:05.280 --> 16:08.280
- And... ECHO:
- Sister! Sister! Sister!

16:08.280 --> 16:11.960
..a voice from the cave came back!

16:11.960 --> 16:13.600
Shhh!

16:14.800 --> 16:18.840
- Do you have cakes and chocolates?
- The Highway Robber cried. And...

16:18.840 --> 16:22.480
- ECHO:
- Chocolates! Chocolates! Chocolates!

16:22.480 --> 16:27.240
- The voice from the cave replied.
- I'm coming to take them!

16:27.240 --> 16:31.440
The rat thief yelled. His greedy eyes grew round and...

16:31.440 --> 16:35.320
- ECHO:
- Take them! Take them! Take them!

16:35.320 --> 16:37.560
Came back the welcome sound.

16:37.560 --> 16:39.080
Ha!

16:39.080 --> 16:40.920
HORSE SNORTS

16:40.920 --> 16:42.800
Ha! Ha!

16:45.640 --> 16:48.520
SMACK!

16:48.520 --> 16:50.560
- HORSE SNORTS
- Ow! Ow!

16:50.560 --> 16:51.800
What?

16:54.720 --> 16:58.480
The Highway Rat leaped off his horse.

16:58.480 --> 17:01.000
Into the cave he strode.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.760
DUCK QUACKS

17:05.440 --> 17:08.200
Ha!

17:08.200 --> 17:09.920
The duck took hold of the horse's reins...

17:09.920 --> 17:11.839
- Yah!
- HORSE NEIGHS

17:11.839 --> 17:13.720
..and galloped down the road!

17:19.720 --> 17:23.040
RAT GASPS

17:23.040 --> 17:24.680
Ow!

17:24.680 --> 17:26.400
Huh?

17:38.560 --> 17:40.800
RAT SIGHS

17:40.800 --> 17:42.640
Pffft! Chocolates!

17:42.640 --> 17:46.320
- ECHO:
- Chocolates! Chocolates! Chocolates! Chocolates!

17:59.160 --> 18:00.680
Aargh!

18:10.560 --> 18:14.080
Faster and ever faster, following all the bends,

18:14.080 --> 18:15.560
the plucky young duck went...

18:15.560 --> 18:19.480
- Riding, riding!
- ..riding -

18:19.480 --> 18:23.080
galloping down the highway - back to her hungry...

18:23.080 --> 18:25.000
Friends!

18:30.480 --> 18:32.120
Here!

18:32.120 --> 18:33.760
THEY LAUGH AND CHEER

18:39.800 --> 18:42.720
Then they shared out the food from the saddle bags

18:42.720 --> 18:45.200
and feasted all night long.

18:49.520 --> 18:52.400
Bright were the flames of the bonfire.

18:52.400 --> 18:55.560
Loud was the music and song.

18:56.920 --> 18:59.160
ANTS CHEER

19:00.800 --> 19:02.880
Oh!

19:02.880 --> 19:04.840
Oh...

19:04.840 --> 19:07.400
Wild was the moonlight dancing...

19:07.400 --> 19:09.920
Merry the cheer and chat.

19:09.920 --> 19:15.200
For now we can live in freedom safe from the Highway Rat.

19:16.480 --> 19:19.640
And what of the Rat in the echoey cave?

19:27.440 --> 19:29.560
WIND HOWLS

19:31.200 --> 19:33.680
