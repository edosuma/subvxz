00:23.448 --> 00:25.550
Katrina.

00:25.584 --> 00:28.286
Abbie.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.054
Abbie!

00:32.891 --> 00:33.958
Oh, thank God.

00:33.992 --> 00:36.061
What happened?

00:36.062 --> 00:37.996
Henry killed Moloch.

00:39.399 --> 00:41.800
I see no signs of purgatory.

00:43.169 --> 00:45.170
The threat...

00:45.205 --> 00:47.840
has been averted.

00:47.874 --> 00:49.875
Where's my sister?

00:51.745 --> 00:53.679
Katrina.

00:53.713 --> 00:54.947
Katrina.

00:54.981 --> 00:56.615
Oh, my God.

00:59.219 --> 01:00.386
Are you all right?

01:00.420 --> 01:01.553
Yes, I believe so.

01:01.588 --> 01:04.456
But what of Henry?

01:04.491 --> 01:06.825
He risked everything to save me.

01:11.464 --> 01:13.098
Where is our son?

01:13.133 --> 01:16.902
I... I woke up a moment ago, and...

01:18.405 --> 01:20.639
He's gone.

01:21.541 --> 01:24.343
He's gone.

01:27.781 --> 01:29.481
He's gone.

01:31.553 --> 01:32.353
_

01:32.452 --> 01:36.288
I should have thought all
produce organic by definition.

01:36.322 --> 01:38.090
Except when it's genetically altered,

01:38.124 --> 01:39.591
artificially colored.

01:39.626 --> 01:43.328
Packed with corn syrup and preservatives.

01:43.363 --> 01:45.397
But tastes are changing... the
whole farm-to-table movement

01:45.432 --> 01:46.765
is on fire.

01:46.800 --> 01:51.203
I-I still fail to understand
how that constitutes a movement.

01:51.237 --> 01:54.206
People of this era are trying to remake,

01:54.240 --> 01:58.010
reconceive, reinvent at every turn.

01:58.044 --> 02:00.012
Reinvention isn't such a bad thing.

02:00.046 --> 02:02.014
Have you ever had a Grapple?

02:02.048 --> 02:03.982
I have had to engage
in hand-to-hand combat

02:04.017 --> 02:05.083
on many occasions.

02:05.118 --> 02:06.385
Not that kind of grapple.

02:06.419 --> 02:09.288
It's a... a mash-up.

02:09.322 --> 02:10.889
It's a grape plus an apple.

02:10.924 --> 02:15.294
My point exactly. A union
that hardly seems necessary.

02:16.262 --> 02:17.902
Lieutenant. Lieutenant, look.

02:17.931 --> 02:19.364
Discoloration on the skin.

02:20.934 --> 02:22.935
A distinct odor.

02:22.969 --> 02:24.703
Brimstone.

02:30.810 --> 02:32.845
- Ugh.
- Oh, so sorry.

02:32.879 --> 02:34.279
We lost a few trees to blight.

02:34.314 --> 02:36.381
Thought I'd pulled all the rotten ones.

02:36.416 --> 02:38.650
Have you noticed any strange goings-on?

02:38.685 --> 02:42.221
Inhuman voices at night
muttering unholy words?

02:42.255 --> 02:43.956
Animal carcasses, intestines strewn...

02:45.325 --> 02:47.326
Lieutenant. Ow. Lieutenant.

02:47.360 --> 02:51.396
What he means to say is,
"Thank you, we're all good."

02:51.431 --> 02:53.932
This rotten fruit might
be the evidence we seek

02:53.967 --> 02:55.934
that evil is still at large.

02:55.969 --> 02:57.336
It has been six weeks, Crane.

02:57.370 --> 03:00.339
We haven't seen any definitive signs.

03:00.373 --> 03:04.543
No... something supernatural is gestating.

03:04.577 --> 03:06.545
I'm certain of it.

03:10.016 --> 03:12.784
Hunters reported inhuman voices

03:12.819 --> 03:14.453
a few miles from Wilcox Farms.

03:14.487 --> 03:17.456
The livestock involved
were in farms nearby.

03:17.490 --> 03:19.725
And the rotten fruit was harvested

03:19.759 --> 03:22.127
from Wilcox Farms itself.

03:22.161 --> 03:23.495
Yes, it all seems

03:23.530 --> 03:25.697
to point towards the workings

03:25.732 --> 03:27.633
of an unholy ceremony.

03:27.667 --> 03:29.501
I'm not saying that this
isn't supernatural, Crane.

03:29.536 --> 03:31.603
But... we've been putting in crazy hours,

03:31.638 --> 03:34.239
out every night searching for clues.

03:34.274 --> 03:36.341
As is our duty as Witnesses.

03:36.376 --> 03:37.342
Exactly.

03:37.377 --> 03:39.044
Could either of us imagine our lives

03:39.078 --> 03:41.446
without battling evil?

03:41.481 --> 03:43.181
We'd have to reinvent ourselves.

03:43.216 --> 03:45.050
This is a conversation for a day

03:45.084 --> 03:47.553
when we do not have a trail to follow.

03:47.587 --> 03:50.355
Mm. All right.

03:50.390 --> 03:52.558
Well, if there is someone out there

03:52.592 --> 03:56.395
doing dark magic, you know
who we need to talk to.

03:56.429 --> 03:58.130
No.

03:58.164 --> 03:59.932
Not at this early stage
of the investigation.

03:59.966 --> 04:00.999
Oh.

04:01.034 --> 04:02.634
My discussion with Katrina

04:02.669 --> 04:05.304
on the night of Moloch's death raised many

04:05.338 --> 04:07.639
complicated issues.

04:07.674 --> 04:11.843
We mutually agreed to mull them over alone.

04:15.815 --> 04:17.482
May I come into your room?

04:17.517 --> 04:20.619
So you cool posting up in here

04:20.653 --> 04:22.988
while she's living at the
cabin? It's not even your cabin.

04:23.022 --> 04:25.624
'Tis not my archives, either. However,

04:25.658 --> 04:27.726
solitude can be invigorating.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.795
I've over 200 years of
reading to catch up on.

04:29.829 --> 04:30.796
Crane.

04:30.830 --> 04:33.098
Seriously.

04:33.132 --> 04:35.067
That's what partners are for.

04:35.101 --> 04:36.802
There's no judgment.

04:38.938 --> 04:41.306
And, yes, Lieutenant.

04:41.341 --> 04:44.743
This reexamination of my
marriage is extremely trying.

04:44.777 --> 04:46.445
It can't feel good.

04:46.479 --> 04:49.615
When she spends more time with
our greatest enemy than you.

04:49.649 --> 04:52.918
Her magical wards have been instrumental

04:52.952 --> 04:54.920
in keeping the Horseman captive.

04:54.954 --> 04:57.122
And I do believe

04:57.156 --> 04:58.557
she pities Abraham.

04:58.591 --> 05:01.860
Why waste a single iota
of compassion on him?

05:01.894 --> 05:03.495
He's a monster and a killer.

05:03.529 --> 05:05.797
But beneath the monster is a man.

05:05.832 --> 05:07.966
I've seen him.

05:08.001 --> 05:09.868
In the Gorgon's cave.

05:11.204 --> 05:12.924
I was supposed to be
the hero of this story,

05:12.939 --> 05:13.939
not the villain!

05:13.973 --> 05:16.041
Do not dare put this on me.

05:16.075 --> 05:20.779
And Katrina has seen even more.

05:21.547 --> 05:23.882
Given time, I'm certain

05:23.916 --> 05:25.283
we shall discuss it at length.

05:25.318 --> 05:27.486
Now, whilst she said

05:27.520 --> 05:31.456
we could call on her if needed, I...

05:31.491 --> 05:33.392
I would rather not.

05:33.426 --> 05:37.229
Not until we know the true nature

05:37.263 --> 05:39.564
of this threat we face.

05:41.968 --> 05:44.336
Then let's go to Wilcox Farms.

05:44.370 --> 05:47.339
See what we can see.

05:49.909 --> 05:52.044
On me, Lieutenant.

05:54.814 --> 05:56.782
Seriously, Crane?

05:56.816 --> 05:58.083
Shh.

05:58.117 --> 05:59.718
We've been here over an hour.

05:59.752 --> 06:03.155
Let's call it.

06:06.159 --> 06:08.527
- We may as well head home.
- Mm.

06:13.266 --> 06:15.467
You really haven't wondered

06:15.501 --> 06:17.903
if our battle against the
forces of evil is over?

06:17.937 --> 06:19.671
In truth?

06:21.607 --> 06:24.342
No, I've not.

06:24.377 --> 06:27.546
Or you haven't let yourself.

06:27.580 --> 06:31.149
Neither of us have, because
if the apocalypse is over

06:31.184 --> 06:34.186
and our job as Witnesses is done,

06:34.220 --> 06:36.321
we'd have to figure out life without it.

06:36.355 --> 06:39.791
You think I'm using our
mission... our duty...

06:39.826 --> 06:41.760
to escape the reality of my situation?

06:41.794 --> 06:42.961
Come on.

06:42.995 --> 06:45.664
If some supernatural creature

06:45.698 --> 06:47.699
were hiding out on this farm,

06:47.734 --> 06:50.969
tell me you wouldn't be relieved.

06:51.003 --> 06:52.204
Before I knew

06:52.238 --> 06:53.739
that we were Witnesses,

06:53.773 --> 06:57.409
I didn't have any of the
big questions locked down.

06:57.443 --> 06:59.311
Should I enroll at Quantico?

06:59.345 --> 07:01.613
Take the next step in your career.

07:01.647 --> 07:03.815
Find a husband with whom to settle.

07:03.850 --> 07:05.851
A husband?

07:05.885 --> 07:07.319
You really going there?

07:07.353 --> 07:10.122
W... Oh, uh...

07:10.156 --> 07:11.623
I in no way meant to imply

07:11.657 --> 07:13.525
a point of view that was in any way

07:13.559 --> 07:16.328
- demeaning to the modern woman...
- I know.

07:17.530 --> 07:20.499
I'm 250 years removed

07:20.533 --> 07:22.734
from everything I ever knew.

07:22.769 --> 07:25.003
I shall need a job.

07:25.037 --> 07:26.404
A permanent abode.

07:26.439 --> 07:29.508
Mm, 401(k), a mortgage, health insurance,

07:29.542 --> 07:31.877
credit cards, Social Security,

07:31.911 --> 07:35.013
an accountant, a dentist,
your own set of wheels.

07:35.047 --> 07:37.415
Point made, Lieutenant.

07:37.450 --> 07:38.750
Point made.

07:38.785 --> 07:41.553
I may indeed have spent the past six weeks

07:41.587 --> 07:43.789
traipsing the woods with a loaded weapon

07:43.823 --> 07:46.758
because it is the only purpose I know.

07:49.695 --> 07:52.297
Without the threat of apocalypse,

07:52.331 --> 07:54.332
what is my place in the world?

07:56.335 --> 07:58.503
You hear that?

08:10.283 --> 08:12.651
Not feeling all that relieved anymore.

08:14.520 --> 08:16.855
Lock and load.

08:19.994 --> 08:21.237
_

08:21.561 --> 08:24.362
A divination ceremony. _

08:24.397 --> 08:26.298
They're trying to find someone. _

08:26.332 --> 08:28.600
Then let's find out who.

08:29.566 --> 08:30.363
_

08:30.364 --> 08:32.255
_

08:33.539 --> 08:36.006
Sleepy Hollow Sheriff's
Department. None of you move. _

08:52.792 --> 08:54.926
Is that what I think it is?

08:54.961 --> 08:58.230
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

09:17.850 --> 09:21.086
I'm Orion. Are you friend or foe?

09:50.016 --> 09:53.927

09:58.053 --> 10:00.388
- So you're an angel.
- Yes, I am.

10:00.422 --> 10:02.857
And you are Witnesses.

10:02.891 --> 10:05.159
Our reputation precedes us.

10:05.194 --> 10:07.361
My name is Ichabod Crane.

10:07.396 --> 10:09.530
This is my partner
Lieutenant Abigail Mills.

10:09.565 --> 10:10.865
A soldier?

10:10.899 --> 10:12.433
A cop.

10:12.467 --> 10:13.968
And I need you to drop that.

10:14.002 --> 10:16.470
I mean you no harm.

10:16.505 --> 10:19.040
Okay, good. Prove it.

10:19.074 --> 10:21.375
We lower our weapons together.

10:39.195 --> 10:41.312
_

10:42.239 --> 10:43.829
_

10:44.105 --> 10:47.007
_

10:49.133 --> 10:49.733
_

10:51.308 --> 10:53.484
_

10:54.465 --> 10:56.246
_

11:13.462 --> 11:16.030
We'll be taking leave now, Abraham.

11:16.064 --> 11:20.801
I don't like that you're bound
here any more than you do.

11:20.836 --> 11:22.737
I've spent weeks searching for a solution.

11:22.771 --> 11:24.772
A way to kill the unkillable?

11:24.806 --> 11:27.341
A way for you to return
to your former self.

11:27.376 --> 11:29.176
Separate you from the Avatar of Death.

11:29.211 --> 11:32.113
I am the Horseman, and the Horseman is me.

11:32.147 --> 11:34.115
You were transformed,

11:34.149 --> 11:36.384
and transformations can be reversed.

11:36.418 --> 11:38.452
Even if it were possible,

11:38.487 --> 11:40.187
why would you consider attempting it

11:40.222 --> 11:41.722
after all I have done to you?

11:41.757 --> 11:44.525
'Cause I had time to
think of the past, Abraham.

11:44.559 --> 11:46.494
How you, Ichabod and I ended up

11:46.528 --> 11:49.363
on opposite sides in this war.

11:49.398 --> 11:50.698
Your jealousy was the spark

11:50.732 --> 11:53.567
that lit the flame of your anger.

11:53.602 --> 11:54.969
It makes me responsible

11:55.003 --> 11:57.538
for your taking on the
mantle of the Horseman.

12:03.145 --> 12:06.047
Think on it, Abraham.

12:06.081 --> 12:09.984
With Moloch gone, you are a
horseman without an apocalypse.

12:10.018 --> 12:13.254
Let me try and repair what has been broken.

12:13.288 --> 12:15.289
It pains me to see you like this.

12:15.324 --> 12:18.993
The last thing I want is your pity.

12:19.027 --> 12:22.296
If your job strengthening
the bars of my cage is done,

12:22.331 --> 12:24.098
leave me.

12:26.134 --> 12:28.235
You are Witnesses.

12:28.270 --> 12:30.237
Yet you fought these creatures?

12:30.272 --> 12:32.340
You battle against evil?

12:32.374 --> 12:34.809
Ever since we found out
that we were Witnesses,

12:34.843 --> 12:38.079
we've been fighting creepy
crawlies when they pop up.

12:38.113 --> 12:40.915
We've not met anyone like you...

12:40.949 --> 12:42.983
on the same side as us.

12:43.018 --> 12:44.352
Are you alone?

12:44.386 --> 12:46.387
Sadly, I am the only one of my kind

12:46.421 --> 12:49.123
who has chosen to meet
the forces of evil head-on.

12:49.157 --> 12:51.158
Up until six weeks ago,

12:51.193 --> 12:54.195
I was held prisoner in
purgatory by the demon Moloch.

12:54.229 --> 12:56.030
Six weeks ago.

12:56.064 --> 12:58.733
So you were liberated
the night Moloch died?

12:58.767 --> 13:02.970
When he came to an end, a great
quake shook all of purgatory,

13:03.004 --> 13:05.172
allowing me to escape.

13:05.207 --> 13:08.542
You... you escaped?

13:08.577 --> 13:11.112
Were there others that did the same?

13:11.146 --> 13:12.646
The creatures we were hunting.

13:12.681 --> 13:14.482
They were amongst those that fled.

13:14.516 --> 13:17.385
My first mission is to find them

13:17.419 --> 13:19.120
and anybody else that escaped

13:19.154 --> 13:22.022
from purgatory and end them.

13:24.092 --> 13:26.927
Ah.

13:26.962 --> 13:28.796
From Katrina. She has

13:28.830 --> 13:31.265
a rather pressing matter to discuss.

13:31.299 --> 13:32.967
You guys haven't spoken in weeks.

13:33.001 --> 13:34.835
This is good. Go.

13:34.870 --> 13:36.337
We can't just leave him here

13:36.371 --> 13:39.039
until we know what his deal is.

13:39.074 --> 13:41.542
So, you take the car, find
out what Katrina wants,

13:41.576 --> 13:43.844
and I'll keep an eye on our new friend.

13:43.879 --> 13:46.547
How can we be certain he is as he says?

13:46.581 --> 13:48.883
Wings are kind of a dead giveaway.

13:49.918 --> 13:52.653
Can't trust an angel, who can you trust?

13:52.687 --> 13:54.321
Lucifer was an angel.

13:54.356 --> 13:56.957
Noted.

13:56.992 --> 13:58.826
I'll stay on my guard.

14:08.103 --> 14:09.336
Jenny?

14:09.371 --> 14:11.338
Where are you guys?

14:11.373 --> 14:13.607
Oh. We're supposed to meet you at Mabie's.

14:13.642 --> 14:15.409
Yeah. Mike's shift just started.

14:15.444 --> 14:17.645
I'll look so obvious
sitting at the bar all alone.

14:17.679 --> 14:19.246
I need my wing woman.

14:19.281 --> 14:21.382
Yeah? Speaking of wings,

14:21.416 --> 14:23.918
you'd never guess what we just found.

14:23.952 --> 14:26.420
There are some creatures that
have escaped from purgatory,

14:26.455 --> 14:28.656
so Crane and I need to put a lid on that.

14:28.690 --> 14:33.461
Just when you thought it was
safe to get back in the water.

14:33.495 --> 14:35.296
So it's not over?

14:35.330 --> 14:37.231
No. There are demons on the loose,

14:37.265 --> 14:38.833
so we got to track them down.

14:38.867 --> 14:41.068
I'll give Hawley a call,
see if he's got something

14:41.102 --> 14:42.536
- that could help.
- Yeah?

14:42.571 --> 14:44.839
Okay. I'll catch up with you later.

14:44.873 --> 14:46.507
Yeah.

15:01.122 --> 15:03.557
Is something wrong?

15:03.592 --> 15:06.427
Quite the opposite.

15:06.461 --> 15:09.663
I was locked in purgatory
for over 200 years.

15:09.698 --> 15:14.969
Since I've been free,
sunrise, the call of a bird...

15:15.003 --> 15:18.138
rare pleasures indeed.

15:18.173 --> 15:19.974
How are we even talking?

15:20.008 --> 15:22.643
Do all angels speak perfect English?

15:22.677 --> 15:25.579
To me, all language sounds the same.

15:25.614 --> 15:29.884
That's got to be pretty
handy on a European vacation.

15:29.918 --> 15:31.418
You're clever.

15:31.453 --> 15:34.054
Mostly curious.

15:34.089 --> 15:38.125
I would kick myself if I didn't ask this.

15:40.061 --> 15:42.096
What's He like?

15:42.130 --> 15:44.798
If He is a He and not a She.

15:44.833 --> 15:46.967
- By "He" you mean...
- Mm-hmm.

15:47.002 --> 15:51.572
The Almighty, Yahweh, Jehovah,
or whatever name you'd use.

15:51.606 --> 15:54.408
The concept of names does not apply.

15:54.442 --> 15:56.877
Neither does the concept of gender.

15:57.913 --> 16:01.115
All there is, is what is.

16:02.150 --> 16:05.185
You'll never be satisfied by my answers.

16:05.220 --> 16:07.187
No, not if you answer like that.

16:08.323 --> 16:11.559
Come on. Does heaven exist?

16:11.593 --> 16:13.394
Why are we here?

16:13.428 --> 16:15.262
Did creation really take seven days?

16:15.297 --> 16:16.564
No.

16:16.598 --> 16:19.733
"No" to creation taking a week,

16:19.768 --> 16:21.635
or "no," you won't answer?

16:24.506 --> 16:26.340
How about dinosaurs?

16:26.374 --> 16:28.509
You ever seen a dinosaur?

16:28.543 --> 16:30.444
Before my time.

16:30.478 --> 16:33.080
But I didn't always walk the Earth.

16:33.114 --> 16:36.984
I served in the Angelic
Host for a long time.

16:37.018 --> 16:39.920
Served, as past tense? So
you're off the reservation?

16:39.955 --> 16:41.689
I broke ranks.

16:42.691 --> 16:45.826
It was not an easy decision.

16:45.860 --> 16:48.662
I can't begin to imagine.

16:55.537 --> 16:57.271
Katrina.

17:00.375 --> 17:03.210
It's good to see you.

17:03.244 --> 17:05.346
And you.

17:06.881 --> 17:09.183
Thank you for coming so swiftly.

17:09.217 --> 17:12.252
Your message was... urgent.

17:12.287 --> 17:14.054
It's a favor I seek.

17:14.089 --> 17:16.790
Since you and Abigail have
sought my help in the past,

17:16.825 --> 17:19.292
I now ask yours in return.

17:19.327 --> 17:21.962
Of course.

17:21.997 --> 17:24.263
It's Abraham.

17:24.299 --> 17:26.032
I believe I've found a way

17:26.067 --> 17:28.702
to separate him from the Horseman of Death.

17:31.072 --> 17:33.507
What were the demons searching for?

17:33.541 --> 17:34.875
They're called "Daevoli"...

17:34.909 --> 17:36.577
lesser demons who live
to serve a greater evil.

17:36.611 --> 17:39.013
With Moloch gone, they
search for a new master

17:39.047 --> 17:40.914
to pledge their allegiance to.

17:40.949 --> 17:42.816
I've been following them for weeks,

17:42.851 --> 17:45.886
waiting for them to lead me
to the one they have chosen.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.721
One of the other creatures
that escaped purgatory?

17:47.756 --> 17:49.056
A servant of Moloch.

17:49.090 --> 17:51.659
One of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

17:51.693 --> 17:54.028
The rider known as Death.

17:54.062 --> 17:57.297
Headless.

17:57.332 --> 17:59.066
Save Abraham?

17:59.100 --> 18:02.336
Even if it were possible,
he is our sworn enemy.

18:02.370 --> 18:03.937
And how much of that was him?

18:03.972 --> 18:05.773
He made a choice out of anger.

18:05.807 --> 18:07.041
All of his actions since

18:07.075 --> 18:09.043
may have been influenced by the dark spirit

18:09.077 --> 18:10.611
he was joined with.

18:10.645 --> 18:11.679
He was your trusted ally.

18:11.713 --> 18:14.848
He is an abomination, Katrina.

18:14.883 --> 18:15.883
The Horseman is

18:15.917 --> 18:17.451
immeasurably powerful

18:17.485 --> 18:18.752
and immortal.

18:18.787 --> 18:22.189
But my weapon will bring him to an end.

18:22.991 --> 18:24.692
This is as much about you and me

18:24.726 --> 18:26.160
as it is about him.

18:27.328 --> 18:28.862
It was our love for each other

18:28.897 --> 18:30.664
that drove him into this terrible state.

18:30.699 --> 18:34.702
And I believe our love
could bring him back.

18:35.737 --> 18:38.772
But if you want no part in it,

18:38.807 --> 18:40.808
I will continue alone.

18:42.110 --> 18:46.747
It is not a decision to be made lightly,

18:46.781 --> 18:50.150
one I must consider.

18:50.985 --> 18:52.820
The Horseman of Death...

18:52.854 --> 18:54.488
I know where he is.

18:55.657 --> 18:56.790
He's our prisoner.

18:56.825 --> 18:58.692
Take me to him.

18:58.727 --> 19:00.761
I will prevent him from
gathering the Daevoli

19:00.795 --> 19:02.830
and any others that escaped purgatory.

19:02.864 --> 19:04.865
Take me to him, Abigail,

19:04.899 --> 19:08.068
and I will destroy him.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.610
I got a 120-pound Bullmastiff

19:16.611 --> 19:18.245
and an eight-pound Maltipoo.

19:18.279 --> 19:20.380
And they're just the best of friends.

19:20.415 --> 19:22.482
Bourbon neat.

19:22.517 --> 19:25.552
And some privacy.

19:28.623 --> 19:31.224
Donnelly is so not your guy.

19:31.259 --> 19:32.960
Okay. Who's Donnelly?

19:32.994 --> 19:34.795
Mixology and muscles over here.

19:34.829 --> 19:36.196
Oh, Mike.

19:36.230 --> 19:38.031
Apparently, we're on a first-name basis.

19:38.066 --> 19:39.399
He wouldn't last a day

19:39.434 --> 19:42.102
before you turned him
into a plate of jelly.

19:44.439 --> 19:45.572
Thank you.

19:45.607 --> 19:48.609
First of all, it's none of your business.

19:48.643 --> 19:52.245
And second of all, what
makes you think I'm into Mike?

19:52.280 --> 19:53.580
Oh, come on, dressed to kill.

19:53.615 --> 19:56.917
Those aren't exactly demon-hunting shoes.

19:56.951 --> 19:58.485
I'm just saying, you can do better.

19:58.519 --> 20:01.054
Oh, that's sweet of you to have noticed.

20:01.089 --> 20:02.389
Next time, don't.

20:02.423 --> 20:05.158
Seriously, he can't
handle a woman like you.

20:05.193 --> 20:06.893
Guy serves spirits. You hunt them.

20:06.928 --> 20:10.697
I would be if you'd brought the
Egg of Haggis you said you had.

20:10.732 --> 20:12.299
Egg of Asag...

20:13.468 --> 20:16.470
Asag is a Sumerian rock demon, okay?

20:17.372 --> 20:19.773
Legend has it he was so ugly,

20:19.807 --> 20:21.608
he couldn't find a wife,

20:21.643 --> 20:26.146
so he mated with mountains,
begat baby rock demons.

20:26.180 --> 20:29.149
This is how he keeps track
of his baby demon pebbles.

20:29.183 --> 20:32.753
Hence, demon tracking device.

20:32.787 --> 20:34.187
How does it work?

20:34.222 --> 20:36.423
Well, the Glory of Asag is supposed

20:36.457 --> 20:40.494
to light the way to the
location of nearby demons.

20:43.564 --> 20:46.867
Nah, not so much right now though.

20:46.901 --> 20:48.902
You don't know how to use it.

20:48.936 --> 20:50.337
Well, it's ancient Sumerian, Mills.

20:50.371 --> 20:52.472
Would you believe the manual's lost?

20:52.507 --> 20:53.974
Well, we got to figure it out.

20:54.008 --> 20:55.175
I got a few ideas.

20:55.209 --> 20:57.544
Why don't we get out of here?

21:03.418 --> 21:06.153
You sure we shouldn't try to
round up those Daevoli first?

21:06.187 --> 21:08.855
This creature, the Horseman...
he is who they seek.

21:08.890 --> 21:12.259
By removing him, we strike
at the heart of the issue.

21:12.293 --> 21:14.995
Oh. I wish you were backing us up

21:15.029 --> 21:18.031
the day we went against Moloch.

21:18.066 --> 21:20.367
We lost people... people I care for.

21:20.401 --> 21:23.036
Our friend, Captain Frank Irving.

21:23.071 --> 21:24.271
No!

21:24.305 --> 21:26.373
Harsh realities of a soldier's life.

21:26.407 --> 21:28.208
Doesn't make it any easier.

21:28.242 --> 21:29.643
It is good to meet someone

21:29.677 --> 21:31.678
who has given everything to their cause,

21:31.713 --> 21:32.846
redefined their role.

21:32.880 --> 21:35.816
Redefined? I don't follow.

21:35.850 --> 21:39.352
You were called to bear witness
to the apocalyptic tribulations

21:39.387 --> 21:42.856
visited on man, asked to observe.

21:42.890 --> 21:44.291
Yet you chose to fight.

21:44.325 --> 21:46.960
It never presented itself as a choice.

21:46.994 --> 21:48.428
I just assumed that...

21:48.463 --> 21:51.098
A testament to your strength of character.

21:51.132 --> 21:54.501
Thank you.

21:54.535 --> 21:57.904
Should you ever need my aid,

21:57.939 --> 22:00.006
hold this charm and think of me.

22:00.041 --> 22:02.275
I can find you.

22:03.144 --> 22:05.879
I always wanted a guardian angel.

22:12.887 --> 22:15.288
Katrina, this is Orion.

22:15.323 --> 22:17.591
One of the Angelic Host.

22:17.625 --> 22:18.959
Here?

22:18.993 --> 22:21.795
You're a witch.

22:21.829 --> 22:24.297
She's my wife.

22:24.332 --> 22:26.733
And you're not of this time, are you?

22:26.768 --> 22:28.602
You or Ichabod Crane.

22:28.636 --> 22:29.636
No, we are not.

22:29.670 --> 22:31.071
Did you find any of the creatures?

22:31.105 --> 22:33.039
Jenny and Hawley are looking for them.

22:33.074 --> 22:34.407
But something else came up.

22:34.442 --> 22:37.477
Orion has a way to kill the Horseman.

22:38.980 --> 22:41.548
Don't get excited all at once.

22:41.582 --> 22:45.152
My husband was put into
an enchanted sleep in 1781.

22:45.186 --> 22:47.454
Then shortly after, I
was sent to purgatory,

22:47.488 --> 22:51.091
where I remained prisoner
until a short while ago.

22:51.125 --> 22:52.526
Purgatory?

22:52.560 --> 22:54.928
Then we have much to talk about.

22:54.962 --> 22:56.763
I was also held captive there.

22:56.798 --> 22:58.298
Katrina believes she can separate

22:58.332 --> 22:59.833
Abraham from the Horseman.

22:59.867 --> 23:01.635
Back up. Save Abraham?

23:01.669 --> 23:04.004
He's one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

23:04.038 --> 23:05.238
What did you tell her?

23:05.273 --> 23:06.473
I expressed my concern.

23:06.507 --> 23:09.142
Told her I'd consider it.

23:09.177 --> 23:11.044
I was imprisoned near
the time that you were

23:11.078 --> 23:13.980
in a forested redoubt called Valley Forge.

23:14.015 --> 23:16.249
You were the angel General
Washington claimed he saw.

23:16.284 --> 23:19.352
His men thought he'd lost his mind.

23:19.387 --> 23:20.787
The Horseman killed Corbin.

23:20.822 --> 23:21.922
A whole cell of Masons.

23:21.956 --> 23:24.124
How long before he puts
you and I in the ground?

23:24.158 --> 23:25.725
For real?

23:25.760 --> 23:27.894
I faced a mighty foe
on the field of battle.

23:27.929 --> 23:32.499
He came at me with an axe that
glowed with the fires of hell.

23:32.533 --> 23:36.937
And I fought my best,
but he got the upper hand.

23:36.971 --> 23:38.371
An axe?

23:38.406 --> 23:41.041
This enemy, was he a
Horseman of the Apocalypse?

23:41.075 --> 23:42.275
Your prisoner.

23:42.310 --> 23:44.077
He beat me.

23:45.546 --> 23:48.915
And his master Moloch
chained me in purgatory.

23:48.950 --> 23:50.817
But I'm free again.

23:50.852 --> 23:52.719
And soon my enemy

23:52.753 --> 23:56.356
will taste the edge of my blade.

23:56.390 --> 23:58.024
All Katrina asks is that we let her try.

23:58.059 --> 24:02.629
If she fails, we have recourse
in our new angelic ally.

24:02.663 --> 24:05.732
What if she fails and the
Horseman kills someone?

24:05.766 --> 24:07.734
That's on us.

24:08.703 --> 24:11.071
I'll tell her myself if you won't.

24:13.674 --> 24:15.008
Where's Katrina?

24:15.042 --> 24:16.743
Your wife took leave a moment ago.

24:21.716 --> 24:23.516
The enchantment I suggested earlier

24:23.551 --> 24:26.419
to separate your spirit
from the Avatar of Death,

24:26.454 --> 24:28.188
would you allow me to try it?

24:28.222 --> 24:30.357
Why the hurry, Katrina?

24:30.391 --> 24:31.858
I need you to tell me now.

24:34.595 --> 24:37.898
If it were possible to
be human again, mortal,

24:37.932 --> 24:39.633
yes, of course.

24:39.667 --> 24:42.636
I need you to promise me
that you'll cease from killing

24:42.670 --> 24:44.504
while I attempt this transformation.

24:44.538 --> 24:46.973
If you hold to your word,
Katrina, I will hold to mine.

24:47.008 --> 24:49.609
I will not take a life while you seek a way

24:49.644 --> 24:51.778
to return me to my former self.

24:51.812 --> 24:53.980
An angel has come.

24:54.015 --> 24:56.116
I fear he means to do you harm.

25:21.675 --> 25:22.980
You let him go?

25:22.981 --> 25:25.122
I believed you were worthy allies.

25:25.123 --> 25:26.422
I was wrong.

25:26.456 --> 25:27.890
He will kill Abraham.

25:27.924 --> 25:29.859
Which is what you brought him here to do.

25:29.893 --> 25:32.826
- Uh, we were yet to make that decision.
- It's crazy,

25:32.827 --> 25:34.761
because we're talking
about a murderous monster.

25:34.795 --> 25:36.696
And if Abraham was one of your friends?

25:36.730 --> 25:38.698
You would not condemn
him to death so easily.

25:38.732 --> 25:40.066
August Corbin was my friend,

25:40.100 --> 25:42.134
and the Horseman murdered
him in front of me.

25:42.169 --> 25:43.336
He is death personified.

25:43.370 --> 25:44.537
Please, both of you.

25:44.571 --> 25:46.038
There is no need for tempers to flare.

25:46.073 --> 25:47.273
Are you kidding me?

25:47.307 --> 25:49.241
When we waver in our duty,

25:49.276 --> 25:51.644
monsters get loose and people die.

25:51.678 --> 25:53.846
We are not jailers, we are not reformers.

25:53.880 --> 25:55.751
We are soldiers, and I
think that we all understand

25:55.752 --> 25:56.882
what the stakes are here.

25:56.917 --> 25:58.543
I can't believe you let
her talk you into this.

25:58.568 --> 25:59.288
I did not.

25:59.289 --> 26:01.821
I recognized the sliver
of the man I once knew

26:01.855 --> 26:04.724
before Katrina told me of her plan.

26:04.758 --> 26:06.559
Though it was deeply unfair of you

26:06.593 --> 26:07.994
to use our marriage as leverage.

26:08.028 --> 26:09.629
Ichabod, you have to
understand, it's not...

26:09.663 --> 26:11.631
No, you must understand.

26:13.800 --> 26:17.637
This is neither the time
nor the place to discuss it.

26:18.572 --> 26:20.506
Please help me to make this right.

26:20.540 --> 26:23.109
We must find Abraham and bring him here.

26:23.143 --> 26:26.946
If Katrina can help him,
you and I need to know.

26:26.980 --> 26:28.714
If not...

26:28.749 --> 26:31.584
then we cross that difficult bridge.

26:32.452 --> 26:33.686
Okay, fine.

26:33.720 --> 26:37.289
The Horseman can't bear daylight.

26:37.324 --> 26:39.625
He'll go to ground before sunrise.

26:39.660 --> 26:41.494
I know you think this unfair.

26:41.528 --> 26:43.129
I know you feel the angel is in the right,

26:43.163 --> 26:45.364
but there is something
about him I mistrust.

26:45.399 --> 26:47.400
He's quick to action, quick to anger.

26:47.434 --> 26:49.001
Wouldn't you be?

26:49.036 --> 26:51.504
He's been searching for
the Horseman for how long?

26:51.538 --> 26:54.540
And we let him go.

26:54.574 --> 26:56.308
We have a lot to talk about.

26:56.343 --> 26:58.678
But no, now is not the time.

26:58.712 --> 27:00.046
Not with the Headless Horseman,

27:00.080 --> 27:02.581
an angry angel and two demons on the loose.

27:02.616 --> 27:04.050
I shall search through

27:04.084 --> 27:07.887
Apocryphal sources for our Angel Orion.

27:07.921 --> 27:10.556
I'll try the old-fashioned
approach... feet on the pavement.

27:21.635 --> 27:23.369
It's not solar powered.

27:23.403 --> 27:25.905
We've tried electricity, fire, water.

27:25.939 --> 27:27.540
We're still nowhere. Not to mention,

27:27.574 --> 27:29.508
Donnelly was the early shift last night,

27:29.543 --> 27:32.111
so, you know, that bird has flown.

27:32.145 --> 27:34.346
You're being very weird.

27:34.381 --> 27:36.849
I'm not.

27:36.883 --> 27:39.118
It's nothing. It... it doesn't matter.

27:39.152 --> 27:40.720
Nothing can't not matter.

27:40.754 --> 27:42.188
Only something can.

27:43.356 --> 27:46.025
I still think about us, Mills.

27:46.059 --> 27:47.793
I should've said something to you.

27:47.828 --> 27:49.328
I didn't, and then it became a thing

27:49.362 --> 27:51.197
because I didn't speak up, so...

27:51.231 --> 27:53.199
Oh, my God.

27:53.233 --> 27:54.734
You're jealous?

27:54.768 --> 27:56.435
You don't get to be jealous.

27:56.470 --> 27:57.803
I know.

27:57.838 --> 27:59.405
You burned that bridge with napalm.

27:59.439 --> 28:00.473
I said it, okay?

28:00.507 --> 28:01.807
I came clean.

28:01.842 --> 28:03.776
Wow.

28:05.512 --> 28:07.713
You're shiftless, Hawley.

28:07.748 --> 28:09.782
You're always moving.

28:09.816 --> 28:12.017
And anything you have
that starts to get real,

28:12.052 --> 28:16.021
to mean something, you bust it into pieces,

28:16.056 --> 28:20.259
break it apart and then run for the door.

28:23.630 --> 28:24.997
Oh, very mature.

28:25.031 --> 28:27.333
No, no, no. When you said,
"Bust it into pieces,"

28:27.367 --> 28:30.936
I remembered this detail
about that Sumerian demon.

28:30.971 --> 28:34.840
Kept his greatest treasures
inside common clay pots

28:34.875 --> 28:37.042
so no one would guess their worth.

28:38.512 --> 28:41.080
Son of a gun.

28:41.114 --> 28:43.149
I can see it.

28:43.183 --> 28:45.551
Ugly bastards.

28:45.585 --> 28:48.687
Okay, we got trees.

28:48.722 --> 28:49.989
A wooded area.

28:50.023 --> 28:52.691
Dirt road leading to a stone building

28:52.726 --> 28:56.395
with an old wooden
carriage missing a wheel.

28:56.429 --> 28:58.531
The Carriage House. Of course.

28:58.565 --> 29:01.367
Okay, there's someone else there.

29:01.401 --> 29:04.236
Oh.

29:04.271 --> 29:07.473
It's your friend with no head.

29:07.507 --> 29:08.674
The Horseman?

29:08.708 --> 29:11.043
He's out.

29:14.614 --> 29:16.182
Jenny, tell me you got something.

29:16.216 --> 29:17.776
The demons you were looking for.

29:17.784 --> 29:19.618
They're with the Horseman at his place.

29:19.653 --> 29:21.654
Should I come meet you?

29:23.590 --> 29:26.125
Don't worry. I got backup.

29:53.687 --> 29:55.421
That was fast.

29:56.756 --> 29:58.490
I wanted to apologize to
you about what happened.

29:58.525 --> 29:59.859
We are fellow soldiers, Abigail,

29:59.893 --> 30:01.861
but if you seek to bar my way...

30:01.895 --> 30:03.729
No, I'm here to help.

30:03.763 --> 30:05.603
I was worried you might
let your fellow Witness

30:05.632 --> 30:08.467
dissuade you from the path we must follow.

30:08.501 --> 30:10.002
It's complicated.

30:10.036 --> 30:12.137
There are personal issues at stake for him.

30:12.172 --> 30:14.006
There is no room in war for half measures.

30:14.040 --> 30:15.875
And I understand that in
a way that Crane can't.

30:15.909 --> 30:17.276
Especially when it comes to the Horseman.

30:17.310 --> 30:21.881
He killed a man who
was like a father to me.

30:24.317 --> 30:28.520
So, my sister found out where
that monster went to ground.

30:29.656 --> 30:31.924
I had a feeling when we met, Abigail,

30:31.958 --> 30:34.994
that it would be portentous for both of us.

30:44.938 --> 30:46.505
Crane, what's up?

30:46.539 --> 30:48.374
It is as I feared.

30:48.408 --> 30:52.011
This angel may not be as
benevolent as we believed.

30:52.045 --> 30:53.412
Yeah? What makes you say that?

30:53.446 --> 30:55.047
I have found reference to the Angel Orion

30:55.081 --> 30:58.517
in a number of Apocryphal biblical sources.

30:58.551 --> 31:03.088
In each, he arrives in the
weeks before great catastrophes.

31:03.123 --> 31:07.293
In Pompeii, before the
eruption of Vesuvius in 79 A.D.

31:07.327 --> 31:08.694
In Syria, at the site

31:08.728 --> 31:11.997
of the Antioch earthquake in 526 A.D.

31:12.032 --> 31:14.166
In 541 A.D., in Byzantium,

31:14.200 --> 31:15.935
in the weeks before the Justinian plague.

31:15.969 --> 31:17.303
And that means what exactly?

31:17.337 --> 31:20.606
Was he there to prevent these events...

31:20.640 --> 31:24.009
or to bring them about?

31:26.513 --> 31:27.980
Crane...

31:28.014 --> 31:30.716
I'm actually with Orion right now.

31:30.750 --> 31:33.619
We're heading to the Carriage House.

31:33.653 --> 31:36.722
Let me get back to you, okay?

31:50.207 --> 31:54.328
_

32:01.849 --> 32:06.826
_

32:22.968 --> 32:25.021
With Moloch dead,

32:25.022 --> 32:27.159
it must feel good to see the
light at the end of the tunnel.

32:27.160 --> 32:29.194
It is a victory that gives me hope

32:29.228 --> 32:30.795
in the many battles to come.

32:30.831 --> 32:32.331
But if we kill the Horseman

32:32.365 --> 32:34.166
and we hunt down the others
that escaped purgatory,

32:34.201 --> 32:35.768
won't we have won?

32:35.802 --> 32:37.069
The battle but not the war.

32:37.103 --> 32:39.438
I don't just seek to destroy, Abigail,

32:39.472 --> 32:40.873
but to rebuild, remake

32:40.907 --> 32:43.409
and reinvent this world as a paradise.

32:43.443 --> 32:45.978
How do you accomplish a
global change like that?

32:46.012 --> 32:49.014
Evil has taken deep root in men's hearts.

32:49.049 --> 32:51.417
It must be lanced like
a sickness of the flesh,

32:51.451 --> 32:54.253
burned out before it corrupts completely.

32:54.287 --> 32:56.488
You mean that metaphorically, right?

32:56.523 --> 32:59.091
I wish I did.

32:59.125 --> 33:04.530
My weapon will end the
Horseman and give me his power.

33:04.564 --> 33:06.599
With it,

33:06.633 --> 33:08.367
I will bring a great judgment,

33:08.401 --> 33:11.237
like the one visited on Adam and Eve

33:11.271 --> 33:12.972
when they ate of the forbidden fruit.

33:13.006 --> 33:14.273
Getting biblical.

33:14.307 --> 33:17.509
Judge mankind? By what criteria?

33:17.544 --> 33:20.112
By their capacity to
visit evil on each other.

33:20.146 --> 33:23.883
And you'll be the judge
and carry out the sentence?

33:23.917 --> 33:26.218
As the Angel of Death passed over Egypt

33:26.253 --> 33:28.420
and took the pharaoh's firstborn.

33:28.455 --> 33:30.890
As the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah

33:30.924 --> 33:33.425
were burned for their wickedness.

33:33.460 --> 33:34.660
As the waters

33:34.694 --> 33:37.763
of the great flood washed the world clean

33:37.797 --> 33:40.165
of man's iniquity.

33:40.200 --> 33:44.069
My blade will cleanse humanity of its ills.

33:44.104 --> 33:46.005
The Horseman is first.

33:46.039 --> 33:48.841
Along with that witch that sided with him.

33:48.875 --> 33:50.409
Wait, Katrina is not evil.

33:50.443 --> 33:53.979
There is no room in this
world for those that harbor it.

33:54.014 --> 33:57.049
All wickedness must be
culled from the flock.

33:58.051 --> 33:59.518
You and I, Abigail,

33:59.552 --> 34:03.923
together we can bring about a golden age.

34:03.957 --> 34:05.958
It begins here,

34:05.992 --> 34:07.927
as we burn this haven

34:07.961 --> 34:10.329
of evil to the ground.

34:34.454 --> 34:36.956
You were right about Orion.

34:36.989 --> 34:38.556
He's a zealot.

34:38.591 --> 34:40.125
He doesn't just want to kill the Horseman,

34:40.159 --> 34:41.393
he wants to steal his power.

34:41.428 --> 34:43.295
And if the Apocryphal texts are correct,

34:43.330 --> 34:44.964
create a disaster.

34:44.998 --> 34:47.232
Sleepy Hollow will be the epicenter

34:47.266 --> 34:50.569
of a conflagration of biblical proportions.

34:53.773 --> 34:55.607
Crane!

34:56.710 --> 34:58.243
Lieutenant!

35:45.692 --> 35:46.959
Crane.

35:59.839 --> 36:02.041
Can you feel that?

36:02.075 --> 36:04.810
My blade gathers your power for my use.

36:04.844 --> 36:06.445
Your death will burn bright,

36:06.479 --> 36:09.548
cauterizing this festering wound,

36:09.582 --> 36:12.551
turn this area into a smoldering crater,

36:12.585 --> 36:15.954
end the evil that escaped purgatory.

36:17.223 --> 36:19.091
We must destroy that blade.

36:19.125 --> 36:21.427
How good is your aim with an axe?

36:22.796 --> 36:24.830
- Good enough.
- All right.

36:24.864 --> 36:27.066
Go around the back behind them.

36:27.100 --> 36:30.369
I'll distract Orion.

36:32.839 --> 36:34.506
Orion.

36:36.176 --> 36:37.943
You know this is wrong.

36:37.977 --> 36:40.379
This is just and right, Abigail.

36:40.413 --> 36:42.014
When you first came out of purgatory,

36:42.048 --> 36:44.583
you said you couldn't help
but see the beauty around you.

36:45.919 --> 36:47.486
But now you want to destroy it.

36:47.520 --> 36:50.255
Precisely because this
world is so beautiful.

36:50.290 --> 36:52.391
Evil has taken hold in men's hearts.

36:52.425 --> 36:54.693
What about the good? The innocent?

36:54.727 --> 36:57.529
Mixed up with the evil and
the corrupt, the wicked.

36:57.564 --> 37:00.032
What are they? Acceptable casualties?

37:00.066 --> 37:01.667
This is war, Abigail.

37:02.435 --> 37:04.636
- All wars have costs.
- No.

37:05.972 --> 37:07.306
You find another way.

37:08.374 --> 37:10.342
What have we here?

37:10.376 --> 37:13.745
You have no hope of beating
me with that weapon, Witness.

37:13.780 --> 37:15.881
I have no intention to.

37:17.217 --> 37:19.384
Lieutenant!

37:35.301 --> 37:37.903
No! Do you know what you've done?!

37:39.205 --> 37:40.305
Little more of a fair fight now.

37:40.340 --> 37:41.573
How could you side with the enemy?

37:41.608 --> 37:43.542
We decide what side we're on.

37:43.576 --> 37:47.312
In this case, the enemy
of my enemy is my ally.

37:47.347 --> 37:50.349
You forgot what you're fighting for, Orion.

38:20.086 --> 38:22.054
Abraham, stop.

38:23.323 --> 38:25.858
If you strike me down,
the chance will be lost.

38:25.892 --> 38:27.793
The chance for you to become the hero

38:27.827 --> 38:29.962
you always thought you could be.

38:38.171 --> 38:42.474
I will let you try and return
me to the man I once was.

38:43.510 --> 38:48.013
But in the interim, I am no man's prisoner.

38:48.882 --> 38:51.383
Leave this place.

38:51.418 --> 38:52.384
Now!

38:52.419 --> 38:53.852
Let's go, Crane.

39:09.235 --> 39:11.570
I'm disappointed.

39:14.374 --> 39:16.341
We share a mission,

39:16.376 --> 39:19.912
but we also swore to share a life together.

39:19.946 --> 39:22.181
You did not attempt to reach me with logic

39:22.215 --> 39:23.849
or fairness last night.

39:23.883 --> 39:27.453
Rather, you used our
marriage as a bargaining tool.

39:27.487 --> 39:30.289
I simply wanted you to support me,

39:30.323 --> 39:32.224
believe in me. Is that so wrong?

39:32.258 --> 39:34.593
When have I not, Katrina?

39:35.829 --> 39:38.497
Henry is our son. Our blood.

39:38.531 --> 39:42.034
Abraham was my friend.

39:42.068 --> 39:43.302
And your fiancé.

39:43.336 --> 39:45.971
They are not the same.

39:46.005 --> 39:48.640
You want to save him out of
guilt and lay it at my feet.

39:48.675 --> 39:51.009
You said you saw something
in him that you recognized.

39:51.044 --> 39:52.277
I did.

39:52.312 --> 39:55.748
His pride. His ego. Anger.

39:56.516 --> 39:59.418
Our past...

39:59.452 --> 40:03.055
weighs so heavily upon us, Katrina.

40:04.724 --> 40:08.327
As Miss Mills and I have
redefined our role as Witness,

40:08.361 --> 40:10.195
so you and I

40:10.230 --> 40:12.965
must redefine our marriage.

40:12.999 --> 40:17.703
If we are to give life to our marriage...

40:19.639 --> 40:21.974
...why not start today?

40:23.676 --> 40:26.612
One small step at a time.

40:38.992 --> 40:41.426
So things are still
upside-down on the home front?

40:41.461 --> 40:43.028
Mm, sideways.

40:43.062 --> 40:45.364
Which is an improvement, at least.

40:45.398 --> 40:49.034
Though I feel I should apologize

40:49.068 --> 40:52.871
if it seemed I was siding with Katrina.

40:52.906 --> 40:56.508
Maybe I should apologize
if it seemed like I was...

40:56.543 --> 40:58.477
siding with a winged zealot

40:58.511 --> 41:01.213
who wants to cleanse the world of evil.

41:01.247 --> 41:03.448
Hindsight's always 20/20.

41:03.483 --> 41:06.518
Katrina was right to let Abraham go.

41:06.553 --> 41:10.622
You think Orion's gone for good?

41:10.657 --> 41:12.558
He is defeated,

41:12.592 --> 41:14.960
his weapon shattered.

41:14.994 --> 41:18.330
Let us hope he takes ample time to recover.

41:18.364 --> 41:22.034
Playing field has changed,
but the war isn't over.

41:22.068 --> 41:24.236
May never be.

41:25.538 --> 41:29.308
But... what happened today was important.

41:29.342 --> 41:30.742
What? That we disagreed?

41:30.777 --> 41:33.846
Mm. We pushed each other.

41:33.880 --> 41:36.415
We need that. Checks and balances, right?

41:38.318 --> 41:41.620
No matter what obstacles we face,

41:41.654 --> 41:45.557
no matter how many disagreements we have...

41:45.592 --> 41:48.227
our bond cannot be broken.

41:52.332 --> 41:54.733
Witness represent.

42:18.658 --> 42:20.959
Can I help you?

42:26.532 --> 42:30.002
You can't be in here without
shoes. It's store policy.

42:35.475 --> 42:38.076
You have cash for that?

42:45.218 --> 42:47.286
Sir.

42:47.320 --> 42:50.389
Where am I?

42:50.423 --> 42:54.259
Is this heaven or hell?

42:54.294 --> 42:55.761
Neither, man.

42:55.795 --> 42:57.930
It's Sleepy Hollow.
