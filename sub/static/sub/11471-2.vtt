- Good morning, Miss.
- Good morning.

00:56.942 --> 00:59.576
Victoria: <i>It seems someone
called the Marquesa de Salobrena</i>

00:59.577 --> 01:01.678
<i>is coming in for the
opening of the season.</i>

01:01.679 --> 01:03.413
SalobreÃ±a, dear.

01:03.414 --> 01:05.816
The squiggly mark, it makes a noise.

01:05.817 --> 01:07.118
Oh.

01:07.119 --> 01:11.388
So much young European
royalty in New York these days.

01:12.190 --> 01:15.158
They call our money new,

01:15.159 --> 01:18.595
but it certainly does attract a crowd.

01:18.596 --> 01:20.630
Sure are some nice shoes.

01:24.034 --> 01:26.002
Thank you.

01:27.972 --> 01:30.373
Some kind of fancy leather.

01:30.374 --> 01:32.175
Must have cost you heavy.

01:32.176 --> 01:34.610
Everything moving forward
with the electrification

01:34.611 --> 01:38.114
now that Thackery has seen the light?

01:38.115 --> 01:40.583
Well, the crews finished the installation

01:40.584 --> 01:42.185
on the operating theater and the wards.

01:42.186 --> 01:45.988
Oh, we're now a modern hospital.

01:45.989 --> 01:48.491
The board must be pleased.

01:53.430 --> 01:55.464
Aren't they?

01:55.465 --> 01:58.267
Where you get a pair of shoes like that?

01:58.268 --> 02:00.303
At a store.

02:00.304 --> 02:02.204
Which one?

02:02.205 --> 02:03.939
Maybe I get me a pair like that.

02:03.940 --> 02:08.243
It's not a very fair position to
put a young woman in, August.

02:08.244 --> 02:11.680
I'm sure Cornelia's only doing it
because she can't say no to you.

02:11.681 --> 02:14.716
I actually like it. I just...

02:14.717 --> 02:17.419
I wish I didn't feel so...

02:18.221 --> 02:20.254
Say it.

02:20.255 --> 02:22.324
So damn stiff.

02:22.325 --> 02:24.392
Casswell's down on 20?

02:24.393 --> 02:26.594
Tip Top on Madison?

02:26.595 --> 02:28.630
Levasseur.

02:28.631 --> 02:30.332
Le what?

02:30.333 --> 02:32.099
Where's that?

02:32.100 --> 02:34.001
Paris.

02:34.002 --> 02:35.969
Paris?

02:36.905 --> 02:38.439
France.

02:38.440 --> 02:40.474
I know where Paris is, nigger.

02:40.475 --> 02:42.676
<i>(door opens)</i>

02:43.712 --> 02:46.180
Man: <i>You lucky you was next.</i>

02:46.181 --> 02:49.917
Cornelia: <i>I'm afraid no one
really takes me seriously.</i>

02:49.918 --> 02:52.185
<i>I'm worried I'm letting you down.</i>

02:53.421 --> 02:57.257
August: <i>Neely, sweetheart...</i>

02:58.426 --> 03:01.462
if I didn't think you
were up to the task,

03:01.463 --> 03:03.764
I wouldn't have put you there.

03:03.765 --> 03:07.167
Yes, I could get any number of men

03:07.168 --> 03:10.303
to sit in as my proxy, but no one,

03:10.304 --> 03:12.172
not even your brother,

03:12.173 --> 03:15.909
thinks the way I do more than you.

03:15.910 --> 03:19.045
If you'd been born a man, you'd
be running this whole damn city.

03:19.046 --> 03:21.647
- (laughs)
- I don't doubt it.

03:21.648 --> 03:26.419
Besides, any bad news
delivered to the board

03:26.420 --> 03:29.021
or anyone else

03:29.022 --> 03:31.691
would just sound sweeter
coming from you.

03:31.692 --> 03:32.992
Thank you.

03:32.993 --> 03:35.160
Now finish your breakfast
so you're not late.

03:35.161 --> 03:36.662
Aye, aye, Captain.

03:36.663 --> 03:39.198
(laughs)

05:28.338 --> 05:29.872
That all of 'em?

05:29.873 --> 05:33.309
Pouncey: <i>Uh, all that's living.</i>

05:33.310 --> 05:37.212
Got one more here, but he ain't moving.

05:38.381 --> 05:40.448
Naw, he's moving.

05:40.449 --> 05:42.484
He was dead when we
scraped him off the ground.

05:42.485 --> 05:44.219
You a doctor? Huh?

05:44.220 --> 05:46.922
Well, as far as I can tell, he's
another body delivered alive.

05:46.923 --> 05:49.057
Wheel him in.

05:50.126 --> 05:51.760
That's seven in all.

05:51.761 --> 05:53.428
New building going up near Broad Street.

05:53.429 --> 05:56.097
Me and Pounce must have waited
all week for that crane to go,

05:56.098 --> 05:58.933
but when it went, boyo,
that really did it.

05:58.934 --> 06:01.169
A holy show if I ever saw one.

06:01.170 --> 06:04.739
Schuldheit and Sons,

06:04.740 --> 06:06.941
so's you know where to send the bill.

06:08.344 --> 06:10.244
I wager you'll already
have your stretcher

06:10.245 --> 06:13.047
waiting under me when
my day comes, Cleary.

06:13.048 --> 06:14.682
Might just.

06:14.683 --> 06:16.584
Now, Mr. Barrow, it's
the end of the month

06:16.585 --> 06:18.085
and we need to be settling up.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.887
Counting these seven,
that's 22 altogether

06:19.888 --> 06:22.723
at two bits per, that's
five and half you owe me.

06:22.724 --> 06:24.926
Are you sharing with Pouncey?

06:24.927 --> 06:26.460
Sure.

06:26.461 --> 06:29.063
Just last week I bought
him a pint at the pub.

06:29.064 --> 06:30.764
He's a good lad,

06:30.765 --> 06:32.599
but he's thick as champ.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.969
Get a bucket, scrub out that blood

06:35.970 --> 06:38.338
and see me in my office
and I'll have your money.

06:38.339 --> 06:40.074
- All right, mate.
- This one's dead.

06:40.075 --> 06:42.342
You can drag him to the morgue.

06:42.343 --> 06:44.844
(chuckles)

06:44.845 --> 06:48.614
Looks like you'll be buying one
less pint for your friend.

06:51.518 --> 06:53.352
- What the fuck?
- I told you he was dead.

06:53.353 --> 06:55.088
Get in.

06:59.226 --> 07:03.061
Let's see here. (mutters)

07:10.670 --> 07:14.440
And one, two, three.

07:20.313 --> 07:23.215
And this is the pathological lab.

07:23.216 --> 07:24.717
My workshop.

07:24.718 --> 07:26.251
Only one in the city.

07:26.252 --> 07:29.421
Other hospitals may frown
on studying the dead,

07:29.422 --> 07:31.056
<i>but I believe it is the only way</i>

07:31.057 --> 07:33.592
<i>to advance our knowledge of the living.</i>

07:33.593 --> 07:37.329
<i>The answers to disease and the
body do not lie in house calls.</i>

07:37.330 --> 07:39.664
They're here in a lab

07:39.665 --> 07:42.234
where we can experiment and calibrate.

07:42.235 --> 07:45.237
Cancer, syphilis, tuberculosis,

07:45.238 --> 07:47.071
all their mysteries
waiting to be unlocked

07:47.072 --> 07:50.241
and take us soaring
into the next century.

07:50.242 --> 07:52.443
They built all this just for you?

07:52.444 --> 07:54.879
The wealth supporting
the Knick is endless.

07:54.880 --> 07:57.749
People here want their
hospital to be the best.

07:57.750 --> 07:59.984
And they're willing to pay.

07:59.985 --> 08:01.886
All I have to do is ask.

08:01.887 --> 08:04.055
Of course, there are certain obligations

08:04.056 --> 08:05.722
that come along with
getting what I want.

08:05.723 --> 08:07.291
Such as?

08:07.292 --> 08:09.993
Hiring a new surgical apprentice.

08:11.796 --> 08:13.964
<i>How did you come to
know Captain Robertson?</i>

08:13.965 --> 08:16.733
I did some work with him in Nicaragua.

08:16.734 --> 08:19.703
- Now he wants you here?
- No, that was my idea.

08:19.704 --> 08:22.806
You are legitimizing surgery.

08:22.807 --> 08:25.542
Taking it out of the
barbershops and into the future

08:25.543 --> 08:27.410
and I want to be a part of it.

08:27.411 --> 08:30.013
You do realize if you choose to join us,

08:30.014 --> 08:32.414
the work will be hard and the hours long,

08:32.416 --> 08:34.751
the results slow and agonizing,

08:34.751 --> 08:38.754
and we will see no shortage
of death at our own hands.

08:38.755 --> 08:39.989
But the rewards...

08:39.990 --> 08:43.525
The rewards will be the
achievement of it all.

08:43.527 --> 08:46.596
"When the blast of war
blows in our ears,

08:46.597 --> 08:48.998
then imitate the action of the tiger."

08:48.999 --> 08:51.367
Hmm?

08:51.368 --> 08:53.202
<i>Shakespeare.</i>

08:56.139 --> 08:58.207
Never read him.

09:11.387 --> 09:15.256
Catherine: <i>I think the smells
are what remind me of him most.</i>

09:16.593 --> 09:20.395
His cologne. His soap.

09:20.396 --> 09:23.599
His cut tobacco pouch.

09:23.600 --> 09:26.234
How are you, Catherine?

09:30.840 --> 09:33.041
I miss him.

09:33.042 --> 09:36.611
I meant to pay a call.

09:36.612 --> 09:39.814
Let us both pretend you mean that.

09:47.889 --> 09:49.390
I failed him, John.

09:49.391 --> 09:51.726
- No.
- <i>I tried.</i>

09:51.727 --> 09:53.261
<i>(sniffles)</i>

09:53.262 --> 09:55.229
Country weekends, time with the children,

09:55.230 --> 09:57.097
dinner parties.

09:58.667 --> 10:00.334
I thought I'd opened the valve for him,

10:00.335 --> 10:01.835
<i>but the pressure was still there.</i>

10:01.836 --> 10:05.072
Blame is easy. Truth is harder.

10:06.074 --> 10:07.908
<i>Then what's the truth?</i>

10:07.909 --> 10:13.180
That my dear friend Jules
lost sight of the procedure.

10:13.181 --> 10:15.849
Stopped seeing the work,
started seeing the death.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.986
Is that the cardinal sin?

10:19.987 --> 10:23.222
You did everything right.
You were a fine wife to him.

10:23.223 --> 10:26.793
Once a man shifts his mind
from the surgical field

10:26.794 --> 10:29.629
to the patient under the drape,
it's only a matter of time.

10:31.932 --> 10:35.267
How will it not take hold
of you the way it did Jules?

10:39.406 --> 10:42.241
I have ways of getting through.

11:12.104 --> 11:15.106
Check that ligature with
saline for leaks, Everett.

11:22.614 --> 11:24.615
It's holding fast.

11:24.616 --> 11:27.818
Dr. Chickering will now
cauterize the end of the duct.

11:36.127 --> 11:38.495
(electricity buzzing)

11:46.671 --> 11:48.505
No flame needed.

11:48.506 --> 11:51.141
But does it make toast?

11:55.146 --> 11:56.680
Very good.

11:56.681 --> 11:59.182
(popping)

11:59.183 --> 12:02.251
- <i>(men murmuring)</i>
- Get it off! Get it off!

12:03.554 --> 12:05.254
Bertie! Bertie!

12:08.125 --> 12:09.926
Gallinger: Nurse Elkins, saline.

12:11.128 --> 12:12.562
Nurse Monk, don't!

12:12.563 --> 12:15.298
- <i>(electricity crackles)</i>
- <i>(alarm ringing)</i>

12:17.567 --> 12:20.569
Cornelia: <i>My family and I
paid more than $12,000</i>

12:20.570 --> 12:22.205
<i>to electrify this hospital.</i>

12:22.206 --> 12:26.209
I am as furious as
you are, Miss Robertson.

12:26.210 --> 12:29.245
I gave the man his charge. I am to blame.

12:29.246 --> 12:30.880
Regardless of who's to blame,

12:30.881 --> 12:33.282
to my father we both appear incompetent.

12:33.283 --> 12:37.620
If our goal in wiring the place
was to showcase our modernity,

12:37.621 --> 12:40.289
then might I suggest that killing nurses

12:40.290 --> 12:44.527
and setting patients afire might
undermine the message a bit.

12:44.528 --> 12:48.196
We were just discussing this and
I am in agreement with you both.

12:48.197 --> 12:50.765
The contractor must be held accountable.

12:50.766 --> 12:52.267
We should run him out of business.

12:52.268 --> 12:54.136
Or just beat the tar out of him.

12:54.137 --> 12:56.071
<i>Thack, there is a lady here.</i>

12:56.072 --> 12:57.572
Well, from the looks of her,

12:57.573 --> 12:59.774
I'd say she'd take the
first bat to the man.

12:59.775 --> 13:01.643
I would if I thought it would help.

13:01.644 --> 13:04.446
I think we should let our attorneys
take a swing at him first.

13:04.447 --> 13:06.280
Agreed.

13:06.281 --> 13:10.852
Before we go tying this up in court,

13:10.853 --> 13:14.255
allow me to speak to this thief

13:14.256 --> 13:16.991
<i>and force him to make
good on his contract.</i>

13:16.992 --> 13:20.394
I warn you, Mr. Barrow, do not
throw good money after bad.

13:20.395 --> 13:21.996
I give you my word.

13:21.997 --> 13:25.232
I will not spend a penny
of the hospital's funds.

13:27.402 --> 13:29.937
You have one week to resolve this.

13:29.938 --> 13:32.139
Thank you for your patience.

13:36.410 --> 13:38.244
Was there something else?

13:38.245 --> 13:41.114
Yes. I've been looking for Dr. Edwards.

13:42.484 --> 13:45.152
Have you tried his office?

13:50.057 --> 13:52.192
Hello?

13:59.800 --> 14:01.834
Algernon?

14:01.835 --> 14:03.836
<i>Yes?</i>

14:09.009 --> 14:11.076
This?

14:11.077 --> 14:13.245
They assigned you this?

14:14.414 --> 14:15.982
With their compliments.

14:15.983 --> 14:18.117
What about the empty space

14:18.118 --> 14:20.887
next to Christiansen's old office?

14:20.888 --> 14:23.322
They say they have another use for it.

14:23.323 --> 14:25.624
And your medical work?

14:25.625 --> 14:28.960
I've been ignored mostly

14:28.961 --> 14:31.863
and barely been allowed
to perform any task

14:31.864 --> 14:34.866
beyond the skills of a first
year medical student.

14:34.867 --> 14:37.202
And as for my teaching, well...

14:37.203 --> 14:40.506
You can't accept this. You're
the deputy chief of surgery.

14:40.507 --> 14:43.775
A position they believe I hold
because of your family, Cornelia.

14:45.277 --> 14:48.713
I expect these things.

14:48.714 --> 14:50.815
You're upset because you don't.

14:56.689 --> 14:58.556
Hello, dear.

14:58.557 --> 15:00.758
Thank you.

15:02.127 --> 15:04.195
Oh, would you take a few steps back?

15:04.196 --> 15:06.230
- Why?
- Please?

15:09.101 --> 15:11.201
Into the light.

15:13.705 --> 15:14.939
Eleanor.

15:14.940 --> 15:16.740
Oh, don't be a stick in the mud.

15:16.741 --> 15:18.742
I'm proud of you.

15:18.743 --> 15:21.111
Look at the camera.

15:21.980 --> 15:23.681
(sighs)

15:23.682 --> 15:25.883
(clicks)

15:25.884 --> 15:27.551
Thank you.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.553
We'll frame that and hang it on the wall

15:29.554 --> 15:31.321
above Lillian's crib.

15:31.322 --> 15:33.656
- Ready for lunch?
- Let me fetch my hat.

15:33.657 --> 15:35.592
Eleanor. Nice to see you.

15:35.593 --> 15:37.561
- Likewise.
- How's Lillian?

15:37.562 --> 15:39.996
- <i>What is she, nine months now?</i>
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

15:39.997 --> 15:42.399
Oh, she has your looks.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.833
Which is a good thing.

15:43.834 --> 15:46.136
Let's hope she has Everett's brain.

15:46.137 --> 15:49.238
I was sorry to hear about
Everett losing the promotion.

15:49.239 --> 15:50.740
- It should have been his.
- Eleanor.

15:50.741 --> 15:53.142
It's all right, Everett.
Let the lady defend you.

15:53.143 --> 15:56.012
You deserve that job.
You'll get it eventually.

15:57.447 --> 15:59.616
Would you care to join us for lunch?

15:59.617 --> 16:01.985
Other business to attend to, I'm afraid.

16:01.986 --> 16:03.920
But thank you.

16:05.622 --> 16:07.523
Herman.

16:07.524 --> 16:09.625
When are we getting more cadavers?

16:09.626 --> 16:11.227
We're through our last one

16:11.228 --> 16:13.662
and my surgeons seem to feel
that practicing a procedure

16:13.663 --> 16:16.265
before attempting it actually has merit,

16:16.266 --> 16:18.033
at the very least for the patient.

16:18.034 --> 16:19.835
I've been giving it my full effort,

16:19.836 --> 16:21.637
but nothing's come loose.

16:21.638 --> 16:24.106
We used to just compete
for bodies with Columbia,

16:24.107 --> 16:25.774
Cornell, and New York University,

16:25.775 --> 16:28.343
but now everyone's training doctors.

16:28.344 --> 16:31.346
What about Cleary's man
at the lunatic asylum upstate?

16:31.347 --> 16:33.015
- He must have something.
- We were outbid.

16:33.016 --> 16:34.883
Cornell is offering everyone triple.

16:34.884 --> 16:39.220
I have checked with every indigent
home, prison, and drunkard ward.

16:39.221 --> 16:41.055
I can't seem to win a body.

16:41.056 --> 16:42.723
Well, then offer more.

16:42.724 --> 16:45.092
<i>More than $75?</i>

16:45.093 --> 16:47.262
I need bodies, Herman.

16:47.263 --> 16:49.230
Look, I have a lead

16:49.231 --> 16:51.166
on a failing heart at Blackwell Island.

16:51.167 --> 16:52.900
With any luck, he won't
survive the week.

16:52.901 --> 16:55.369
And if you need something
on which to practice,

16:55.370 --> 16:58.072
we do still have a fair number of pigs.

16:58.073 --> 17:00.307
His name is Mr. Gatchell.

17:00.308 --> 17:02.076
35, day laborer.

17:02.077 --> 17:03.644
History of syphilis.

17:03.645 --> 17:06.613
He's suffering from a rapidly
growing aortic aneurism,

17:06.614 --> 17:08.582
eroding the second,
third, and fourth ribs

17:08.583 --> 17:10.416
as well as the costal
cartilages on the left...

17:10.417 --> 17:11.851
<i>(electricity crackling)</i>

17:11.852 --> 17:13.420
...of the sternum.

17:13.421 --> 17:17.022
Beside Mr. Gatchell is Mr. Olynyk.

17:17.023 --> 17:19.459
40, sea captain, alcoholic.

17:19.460 --> 17:20.859
No history of syphilis.

17:20.861 --> 17:23.797
He, too, is suffering
from an aortic aneurism.

17:23.798 --> 17:26.132
Complained of great pain in
the right side of his chest

17:26.133 --> 17:28.334
to the shoulder when admitted.

17:33.007 --> 17:36.209
Veins are dilated across
the entire abdomen.

17:40.314 --> 17:42.815
Diastolic shock can be felt.

17:49.523 --> 17:51.691
Definite murmur can be heard.

17:51.692 --> 17:54.694
Unless that's the damn
lights popping on again.

17:54.695 --> 17:56.095
Treatment?

17:56.096 --> 17:57.796
They were each given 10 injections,

17:57.797 --> 18:00.799
250 cc's of a 1% gelatin solution.

18:00.800 --> 18:03.068
Mr. Gatchell responded adequately.

18:03.069 --> 18:05.237
Mr. Olynyk needed a second round.

18:05.238 --> 18:08.040
Injection strength doubled. 17 in total.

18:08.041 --> 18:11.376
Barrow: It's all right. It's all right.

18:11.377 --> 18:13.979
Let's open these shades, nurses, please.

18:13.980 --> 18:16.615
We need more than window light, Herman.

18:16.616 --> 18:18.250
I'm taking care of it.

18:18.251 --> 18:20.752
Today or I will resolve it myself.

18:20.753 --> 18:22.821
Absolutely.

18:24.357 --> 18:27.058
We should prepare
Mr. Olynyk for surgery.

18:27.059 --> 18:30.027
He'll likely rupture
within a day without it.

18:30.028 --> 18:33.030
<i>We'll ligate the aorta</i>
<i>with aneurysmorrhaphy.</i>

18:33.031 --> 18:35.432
Gallinger: <i>I suppose it's
preferable to doing nothing.</i>

18:35.433 --> 18:38.136
Thackery: <i>Don't be so sure. It's
yet to produce anything but death.</i>

18:38.137 --> 18:40.772
<i>Keep the injections going
with Mr. Gatchell.</i>

18:40.773 --> 18:42.406
Edwards: <i>Dr. Thackery,</i>

18:42.407 --> 18:45.643
<i>I spent some time at
HÃ´tel-Dieu Hospital in Paris...</i>

18:45.644 --> 18:47.812
Gallinger: <i>Scrubbing
the floors, were we?</i>

18:47.813 --> 18:51.248
Working with Dr. Pierre Thibaux.

18:51.249 --> 18:53.751
We experimented using
a galvanic procedure

18:53.752 --> 18:56.219
on aortic aneurisms and had
a fairly good success rate.

18:56.220 --> 19:00.791
Thank you, Dr. Edwards. But if I want
your ideas, I will ask for them.

19:00.792 --> 19:03.894
Even if our procedure
had a 60% success rate

19:03.895 --> 19:06.462
over gelatin and aneurysmorrhaphy,
which have zero...

19:06.463 --> 19:09.332
60%? I find that very hard to believe.

19:09.333 --> 19:12.535
Well, let the paper that Dr. Thibaux
recently published speak for itself.

19:12.536 --> 19:14.805
As far as I'm concerned, you're only here

19:14.806 --> 19:16.907
to keep the lights on with
the Robertsons' money.

19:16.908 --> 19:19.176
And from the looks of things,

19:19.177 --> 19:21.544
you're not even doing that very well.

19:39.896 --> 19:42.932
Man: <i>You're a ripe
stick of shit, Barrow.</i>

19:42.933 --> 19:45.801
You want to come after
me for your troubles?

19:45.802 --> 19:48.237
You were the contractor.

19:48.238 --> 19:50.772
<i>We've had fires, surges.</i>

19:50.773 --> 19:53.508
A girl died, Clarence.

19:53.509 --> 19:57.612
You won't be laying that at my doorstep.

19:57.613 --> 20:00.315
They come to ask Mulkeen
how this came about,

20:00.316 --> 20:02.517
<i>and I tell them all about
the money you squeezed.</i>

20:02.518 --> 20:04.753
You took the contract.

20:04.754 --> 20:09.458
And you took all the dollars we
needed to do it right and true.

20:09.459 --> 20:11.827
That girl's on your head.

20:11.828 --> 20:13.527
<i>I tell 'em so,</i>

20:13.528 --> 20:16.630
<i>they'll be shackling you up in no time.</i>

20:16.631 --> 20:19.167
They want to get me for kicking
back to you after that,

20:19.168 --> 20:22.970
they can have some good luck finding
me at my mother's in County Clare.

20:26.308 --> 20:28.443
How much?

20:30.812 --> 20:33.047
It's 1,000 to do it right.

20:36.117 --> 20:37.518
800.

20:37.519 --> 20:40.120
That's piss next to what you took.

20:40.121 --> 20:43.323
It's all I've got left.

20:43.324 --> 20:46.159
I'm robbing Peter to pay Paul.

20:46.160 --> 20:48.095
And Peter still wants his money.

20:49.264 --> 20:51.264
I swear on my children.

20:52.934 --> 20:55.468
900 by the end of the day.

20:55.469 --> 20:57.604
<i>No drafts, cash.</i>

20:59.207 --> 21:01.374
Agreed.

21:12.453 --> 21:15.254
A lot of gashes today.

21:15.255 --> 21:18.390
We should charge on a per stitch basis.

21:21.962 --> 21:23.963
Were you told to monitor me?

21:23.964 --> 21:26.265
What? No.

21:26.266 --> 21:28.634
- Of course not.
- Mmm.

21:31.405 --> 21:33.839
Those are finer sutures
than I've ever done.

21:37.577 --> 21:40.479
Please, try to hold your arm still.

21:40.480 --> 21:42.915
Must you touch her so much?

21:42.916 --> 21:46.151
Unless you expect these
stitches to appear by magic,

21:46.152 --> 21:48.386
I'm afraid so.

21:50.122 --> 21:52.357
So...

21:52.358 --> 21:55.460
is it true that you live
in the Tenderloin District?

21:56.795 --> 21:59.030
Yes.

22:00.399 --> 22:03.234
<i>I've been through in
the day once or twice,</i>

22:03.235 --> 22:05.971
but not at night.

22:05.972 --> 22:09.373
Is it really like they say?

22:09.374 --> 22:10.908
Most everything that humans would do

22:10.909 --> 22:13.678
if no one was looking
and God didn't judge.

22:15.080 --> 22:18.382
Hmm. I was thinking
of going to the Haymarket.

22:18.383 --> 22:22.286
My friend who's been
there says it's the most...

22:22.287 --> 22:24.954
entertaining dance hall in the city.

22:26.458 --> 22:29.126
I'm guessing your friend will soon have

22:29.127 --> 22:31.628
a burning sensation when he urinates.

22:31.629 --> 22:35.099
It's nothing more shocking or exciting
than what you see here every day.

22:35.100 --> 22:37.034
Go to the horse races or a boxing match.

22:37.035 --> 22:39.403
Bertie, they're preparing
Mr. Olynyk for surgery.

22:39.404 --> 22:41.605
- Thackery needs us to scrub in.
- Right.

22:41.606 --> 22:44.207
Thank you, Dr. Edwards.

22:52.617 --> 22:57.153
Okay, we are all done here.

22:58.688 --> 23:02.258
You, young lady,

23:02.259 --> 23:04.493
were very brave.

23:08.532 --> 23:10.733
I'll return in a moment
with the dressing.

23:16.072 --> 23:18.106
Excuse me.

23:18.107 --> 23:21.610
Excuse me, madam?

23:21.611 --> 23:24.413
Your arm needs attention.
Where are you going?

23:24.414 --> 23:26.515
The Negro Infirmary on Minetta.

23:26.516 --> 23:28.283
I can drain it for you right here.

23:28.284 --> 23:30.485
No, you can't.

24:46.860 --> 24:48.828
(paper tearing)

25:29.301 --> 25:31.569
Thackery: <i>A little more
suction there, Bertie.</i>

25:32.938 --> 25:34.438
<i>Very good.</i>

25:34.439 --> 25:38.509
<i>Dr. Chickering will now</i>
<i>cauterize the anterior wall.</i>

25:38.510 --> 25:41.379
<i>(sizzling)</i>

25:41.380 --> 25:45.516
Well, it seems the old girl's
not out to pasture yet.

25:45.517 --> 25:48.419
Might explode, but at least
it won't electrocute you.

25:48.420 --> 25:51.322
Perhaps it's not too late
for a career in the law.

25:51.323 --> 25:53.491
Oh, cheer up. You've got
a much better chance

25:53.492 --> 25:55.560
of survival than this fellow.

25:55.561 --> 25:57.895
I've located the aneurism.

25:57.896 --> 26:01.264
It makes the aorta look like
it has a balloon on top.

26:01.265 --> 26:03.333
<i>Take a feel, Bertie.</i>

26:03.334 --> 26:05.168
<i>Palpate the distal side.</i>

26:06.938 --> 26:08.505
Won't even stay firm against a pulse.

26:08.506 --> 26:10.440
It's lost all of its form.

26:10.441 --> 26:13.276
<i>It's miraculous it hasn't already
ruptured and killed him.</i>

26:13.277 --> 26:14.778
It's only a matter of time.

26:14.779 --> 26:16.045
Hunter's ligation?

26:16.046 --> 26:17.814
Resect the weak spot, try to reconstruct?

26:17.815 --> 26:19.349
Yeah, with an aneurysm that large,

26:19.350 --> 26:21.518
once we resect it, there
won't be much tissue left

26:21.519 --> 26:23.720
with which to reconstruct the artery.

26:23.721 --> 26:25.788
- We have to try.
- We do indeed.

26:25.789 --> 26:27.357
Nurse Pell?

26:27.358 --> 26:29.792
Pell: <i>Holding steady at
110 beats per minute.</i>

26:29.793 --> 26:32.261
Once we clamp the pedicel,
we're on the clock

26:32.262 --> 26:34.764
as ischemia is very possible.

26:34.765 --> 26:36.799
Where is Nurse Elkins today?

26:36.800 --> 26:40.502
She's taken the shift on the
postoperative ward for Nurse Monk.

26:40.503 --> 26:43.539
It seems our young Bertram
is unusually aware

26:43.540 --> 26:45.307
of Nurse Elkins' whereabouts.

26:45.308 --> 26:47.376
You seem very interested as well.

26:47.377 --> 26:50.145
Clamp it, Everett. Forceps.

26:50.146 --> 26:53.949
You need to hold that
while I excise that edge.

26:55.885 --> 26:57.519
It's shredding like paper.

26:57.520 --> 26:59.721
140 beats per minute.

27:02.792 --> 27:04.493
Give me some of that rubber tubing.

27:04.494 --> 27:07.963
Then support the inside of the
artery while you sew around it.

27:10.733 --> 27:12.800
There's nothing to work with.

27:13.970 --> 27:15.871
It's in shreds.

27:15.872 --> 27:17.405
Stay cool, Everett.

27:17.406 --> 27:20.008
Just do what you can do
and continue to press on.

27:20.009 --> 27:23.278
- <i>All right.</i>
<i>- Now I'm gonna remove the tubing.</i>

27:23.279 --> 27:25.580
You close the hole behind it.

27:25.581 --> 27:27.148
No, it's not going to hold.

27:27.149 --> 27:30.217
<i>Well, he'll certainly</i>
<i>die if we don't try.</i>

27:30.218 --> 27:31.919
All right.

27:32.755 --> 27:36.390
One, two, three.

27:48.069 --> 27:49.670
I'll go to his family.

27:49.671 --> 27:51.605
Thackery: <i>No, I'll go.</i>

27:51.606 --> 27:53.340
<i>Bertie, you will accompany me.</i>

27:53.341 --> 27:55.909
<i>We'll explain how the procedure failed.</i>

27:57.278 --> 27:58.778
It's tough luck, Everett.

27:58.779 --> 28:00.613
<i>He was doomed before he entered.</i>

28:00.614 --> 28:03.549
<i>We were simply attempting
to reverse his fate.</i>

28:03.550 --> 28:06.585
There just wasn't enough healthy
tissue for the sutures to hold.

28:06.586 --> 28:08.387
<i>Well, we better find a better solution</i>

28:08.388 --> 28:10.790
<i>because it's Mr. Gatchell who's next.</i>

28:10.791 --> 28:13.659
What about Dr. Edwards? The
galvanic procedure he mentioned?

28:13.660 --> 28:15.761
Forget Edwards. He's a fool.

28:15.762 --> 28:19.832
<i>Yes, but he's a fool who studied
with some very fine surgeons.</i>

28:19.833 --> 28:22.034
<i>I'm loath to take up his errand,</i>

28:22.035 --> 28:25.771
<i>but dumb luck may have stumbled
him into something useful.</i>

28:26.740 --> 28:28.507
<i>And I think we can all agree</i>

28:28.508 --> 28:33.478
<i>there is nothing less useful
than what we just attempted.</i>

28:33.479 --> 28:37.549
We don't need him, we just need the
surgical paper on the procedure.

28:37.550 --> 28:39.417
Dr. Wodsworth has an extensive library

28:39.418 --> 28:40.953
in his office on Park Avenue.

28:40.954 --> 28:44.189
He gets all the European journals.
We'll look there.

28:44.190 --> 28:47.092
I highly doubt they'll be too keen on
sharing it with anyone from the Knick.

28:47.093 --> 28:49.794
Well, then be creative.

29:02.475 --> 29:04.675
Gentlemen.

29:04.676 --> 29:07.844
I take it you're here
on behalf of Mr. Collier.

29:08.947 --> 29:10.814
<i>I would really prefer</i>

29:10.815 --> 29:13.650
you didn't just appear at my workplace.

29:13.651 --> 29:16.153
Please don't touch that.
It's an antique.

29:18.056 --> 29:20.557
You were supposed to
meet Bunky this morning.

29:20.558 --> 29:22.225
You owe your weekly.

29:22.226 --> 29:24.361
Of course.

29:24.362 --> 29:28.565
But there has been a tragedy.

29:29.467 --> 29:31.668
Perhaps you heard.

29:31.669 --> 29:35.371
A poor girl was electrocuted.

29:37.541 --> 29:40.176
Um, which...

29:40.177 --> 29:43.213
She could have been eaten by a whale

29:43.214 --> 29:45.615
or punched out by Kid McCoy.

29:45.616 --> 29:47.317
He don't care.

29:47.318 --> 29:50.120
You're never too busy for Bunky.

29:50.121 --> 29:52.488
See him by midnight

29:52.489 --> 29:56.025
or you won't see the morning.

29:56.026 --> 29:58.560

30:01.799 --> 30:04.166
- <i>(girl vomiting)</i>
<i>- Woman: There, there.</i>

30:04.167 --> 30:05.735
<i>(girl coughing)</i>

30:05.736 --> 30:07.470
All finished?

30:07.471 --> 30:09.371
All right.

30:15.178 --> 30:17.446
Right.

30:17.447 --> 30:19.648
Be back in a moment, darling.

30:30.860 --> 30:32.794
How is he?

30:32.795 --> 30:34.763
- Mrs. Hemming...
- (coughs)

30:34.764 --> 30:37.098
...I think you had better
call for an ambulance.

30:42.438 --> 30:45.073
- (knocks)
- Mrs. Hemming: <i>Yes?</i>

30:45.074 --> 30:47.541
- Mrs. Hemming.
- Cornelia.

30:47.542 --> 30:49.077
Hello.

30:49.078 --> 30:51.812
I was told Cora and your
husband were admitted.

30:51.813 --> 30:54.382
- What is it?
- <i>Typhoid fever.</i>

30:54.383 --> 30:58.453
First Daniel, then a few days ago Cora.

30:58.454 --> 31:01.555
Typhoid? The doctors are certain?

31:01.556 --> 31:03.323
Yes.

31:03.324 --> 31:06.193
And how are you feeling? Any symptoms?

31:06.194 --> 31:11.131
No, but Cora seems to have
enough of them for both of us.

31:12.634 --> 31:15.936
I'm so terribly sorry.

31:15.937 --> 31:19.072
I promise you there are no
better doctors in the city.

31:19.073 --> 31:22.009
Anything you need from the
hospital or my family,

31:22.010 --> 31:23.776
please let us know.

31:23.777 --> 31:25.478
Just your prayers.

31:29.783 --> 31:32.085
- Cadavers, Herman.
- Not now, Thack.

31:32.086 --> 31:34.487
Use the pigs. We have
plenty of them out back.

31:34.488 --> 31:36.455
I can't use pigs.
It's an aortic procedure.

31:36.456 --> 31:39.258
<i>I need human cadavers.</i>

31:39.259 --> 31:43.029
I'll get them. I'll get them!

31:47.300 --> 31:50.002
Woman: <i>Yes, she came in
about 11:00 this morning,</i>

31:50.003 --> 31:51.737
<i>but wasn't here very long.</i>

31:51.738 --> 31:53.639
Did someone take care of her arm?

31:53.640 --> 31:56.475
No, she couldn't wait.
Said she had to get to work.

31:58.045 --> 32:00.346
Did she sign your
registry by chance?

32:03.883 --> 32:05.584
I believe this is her.

32:11.624 --> 32:13.792
Ida Harris.

32:25.804 --> 32:27.439
Yes?

32:27.440 --> 32:30.675
Here are those patient
records you requested.

32:30.676 --> 32:32.877
You've been avoiding me.

32:34.680 --> 32:37.014
No, I haven't. I swear.

32:42.420 --> 32:44.388
Take a seat.

32:56.167 --> 32:58.969
Lucy...

32:58.970 --> 33:00.704
please don't be nervous.

33:00.705 --> 33:02.972
I'm not.

33:05.710 --> 33:08.512
Maybe you do make me a little nervous.

33:09.614 --> 33:12.248
<i>Well, after your experience</i>
<i>with me the other day,</i>

33:12.249 --> 33:14.717
<i>that's understandable.</i>

33:16.553 --> 33:21.190
You found me in a sorry state.

33:21.191 --> 33:22.892
And I asked something of you

33:22.893 --> 33:26.062
that is beyond what a woman,
even a fine young nurse,

33:26.063 --> 33:28.964
should be expected to do.

33:28.965 --> 33:32.168
You know, my circus tent

33:32.169 --> 33:34.670
is no place for a proper girl.

33:35.872 --> 33:37.940
I was glad to help you.

33:39.075 --> 33:41.777
I wasn't sure I was
doing the right thing.

33:44.014 --> 33:47.016
Does that happen to you all the time?

33:47.017 --> 33:49.051
I mean...

33:49.052 --> 33:51.120
you were so helpless.

33:51.121 --> 33:53.188
I made a mistake.

33:54.658 --> 33:57.159
I changed my routine and I
suffered dearly for it.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.961
It won't happen again.

33:58.962 --> 34:02.964
I'll be much more responsible
in monitoring my regimen.

34:02.965 --> 34:05.032
Why do you need it?

34:08.337 --> 34:10.804
Lucy,

34:10.806 --> 34:15.043
there is a life we live within
the walls of this hospital

34:15.043 --> 34:17.110
and one we live outside of it.

34:17.112 --> 34:20.648
And these two lives need not intersect.

34:20.649 --> 34:22.449
Do you understand?

34:23.351 --> 34:26.054
I think so.

34:26.054 --> 34:30.623
You saw me as no one else here has.

34:31.827 --> 34:33.127
I did.

34:33.128 --> 34:35.629
But I have a reputation here

34:35.630 --> 34:38.130
in the medical community
with my colleagues,

34:38.132 --> 34:40.167
and any perceived weakness

34:40.168 --> 34:43.504
could diminish their confidence in
me as a leader and as a surgeon.

34:43.505 --> 34:47.139
And that in turn could endanger
the lives of my patients.

34:48.443 --> 34:50.043
I understand.

34:50.043 --> 34:52.746
What you saw

34:52.746 --> 34:55.415
must remain between us.

34:57.318 --> 34:59.352
Of course.

35:25.044 --> 35:26.545
You sure we should put those on?

35:26.546 --> 35:28.647
No one's ever here this time of night.

35:28.648 --> 35:30.181
You've broken in here before?

35:30.182 --> 35:32.016
He collects scrimshaw.

35:32.017 --> 35:34.253
He won't miss a piece
or two every now and then.

35:34.254 --> 35:36.020
Keep the details to yourself.

35:36.021 --> 35:38.089
Holy...

35:38.090 --> 35:39.791
What do you think, boy?

35:41.794 --> 35:43.795
He suffers from gigantism.

35:43.796 --> 35:46.765
Yeah, well, the Winslow Warlows
could use him as a punter.

35:46.766 --> 35:48.399
Wouldn't even have to
use a fucking cleat.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.635
(laughs)

35:50.636 --> 35:52.370
Oh.

35:52.371 --> 35:55.339
This guy's nutsack's the
size of a sailor's duffle.

35:55.340 --> 35:57.941
Huh?

35:57.942 --> 35:59.477
Elephantiasis.

35:59.478 --> 36:01.345
Well, I bet he can squirt.

36:01.346 --> 36:03.814
(laughs)

36:03.815 --> 36:05.649
I think this is it.

36:07.252 --> 36:10.120
At least it could be. It's in French.

36:20.631 --> 36:23.166
(pigs snorting)

36:35.813 --> 36:37.747
This way, please.

36:37.748 --> 36:40.917
- This don't feel right.
- It'll be fine.

36:40.918 --> 36:42.485
Please.

36:42.486 --> 36:44.987
What part of the hospital is this?

36:44.988 --> 36:46.956
Have a seat.

36:54.431 --> 36:57.366
I'll have to drain this
slowly over several hours.

36:57.367 --> 36:59.768
What are you doing?

36:59.769 --> 37:02.371
I'm going to numb the nerve
trunks in your shoulder

37:02.372 --> 37:03.739
that lead down into your arm.

37:03.740 --> 37:06.542
Have you had cocaine before?

37:06.543 --> 37:09.044
No.

37:09.045 --> 37:11.413
You're going to feel nothing in your arm

37:11.414 --> 37:14.516
and wonderful everywhere else.

37:16.619 --> 37:18.787
It's truly a miracle.

37:18.788 --> 37:20.088
(people chatting)

37:20.089 --> 37:22.457
Give me a beer, a whiskey,

37:22.458 --> 37:25.218

there to get me properly squiffed.

37:31.267 --> 37:34.569
<i>"J.F. Mumford of the New
West Side Athletic Club</i>

37:34.570 --> 37:37.672
did not fight like an amateur
when he met L. Smith.

37:37.673 --> 37:40.174
In the first round, he
sent Smith to the floor

37:40.175 --> 37:41.809
with a right punch to the jaw.

37:41.810 --> 37:44.979
Now in the third, Smith began
by landing some telling blows,

37:44.980 --> 37:47.782
but Mumford braced up and soon had Smith

37:47.783 --> 37:49.684
in a helpless condition."

37:49.685 --> 37:51.686
Sounds like McCarthy getting
beat about by his wife.

37:52.921 --> 37:54.921

37:57.959 --> 38:00.293
Mr. T. Cleary of County Cork,

38:00.294 --> 38:03.363

the fight to M. McCarthy,

38:03.364 --> 38:05.265
shutting his mouth

38:05.266 --> 38:07.867

knowledge you're in this way?</i>

38:56.916 --> 38:58.817
I could never tell him.

38:58.818 --> 39:02.086
He's not the sort of man who...

39:03.156 --> 39:04.656
he just gets angry.

39:04.657 --> 39:06.490
He doesn't mean to.

39:06.491 --> 39:08.225
But another child...

39:08.226 --> 39:09.827
I understand.

39:09.828 --> 39:11.728
Does he know where you are tonight?

39:11.729 --> 39:13.431
Oh, Lord, no.

39:13.432 --> 39:17.034
He's at the bakery.
Halloran's on Chrystie Street.

39:17.035 --> 39:21.104
He works the ovens from
10:00 to 6:00 most nights.

39:22.340 --> 39:24.908
He can't know.

39:24.909 --> 39:27.177
All right, you needn't worry.

39:28.580 --> 39:30.113
Does it hurt?

39:30.114 --> 39:32.215
A little discomfort.

39:32.216 --> 39:34.084
But your husband will
know nothing of it.

39:34.085 --> 39:36.086
I promise.

39:36.955 --> 39:39.589
But will God forgive me?

39:39.590 --> 39:43.226
I don't want to go to
hell for killing a baby.

39:44.295 --> 39:46.896
He knows that you've suffered.

39:46.897 --> 39:50.900
I believe the Lord's
compassion will be yours.

39:50.901 --> 39:52.735
Now, I need you to lay down.

39:52.736 --> 39:55.137
I will make this as painless as possible.

40:17.227 --> 40:19.595
Almost back to normal.

You don't tell me anything.

You don't come in here

Don't make me put
another beating on you.

Please don't.

41:28.563 --> 41:31.931
I came here like a man, didn't I?

41:31.932 --> 41:34.433
A man doesn't come to me and beg.

41:34.434 --> 41:38.170
A man doesn't get in the hole nine grand

41:38.171 --> 41:40.607
and act like he's got choices.

41:40.608 --> 41:44.043
A man pays.

41:44.845 --> 41:48.747
And I will treat you like a man.

41:49.883 --> 41:52.118
Your weekly is due in two days.

41:52.119 --> 41:54.786
You will pay in two days

41:54.787 --> 41:57.055
