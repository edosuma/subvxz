WEBVTT

00:01.602 --> 00:04.004
Sir you need to see this!

00:06.274 --> 00:08.176
Woman: Screaming

00:09.077 --> 00:10.078
Mother of God.

00:10.578 --> 00:15.683
AHS Double Feature Part 2
All New Wednesday at 10 on FX

00:35.035 --> 00:36.804
* *

00:40.341 --> 00:41.675
MAN (on TV): People are
gonna be disappointed that

00:41.809 --> 00:43.010
the arguments will be technical
and constitutional,

00:43.144 --> 00:45.045
and they won't be about
dropping his drawers

00:45.213 --> 00:46.847
and exposing himself. I mean,

00:46.980 --> 00:49.150
they really won't be anything
like that. Uh, but...

00:49.283 --> 00:51.319
(whirring)

00:55.523 --> 00:57.725
(phone ringing)

00:57.891 --> 00:59.893
(man on TV continues
indistinctly)

01:04.998 --> 01:08.001
LINDA:
Hi, you've reached the home of
Linda, Ryan and Allison Tripp.

01:08.136 --> 01:09.570
We're not available
to take your call.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.505
-Please leave a message.
-(beeps)

01:11.639 --> 01:13.674
Linda, it's Mike Emmick at OIC.

01:13.807 --> 01:16.577
We're all set. Let us know
as soon as you make contact

01:16.744 --> 01:18.412
with Ms. Lewinsky this morning.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.752
(dialing)

01:26.086 --> 01:28.122
(line ringing)

01:28.256 --> 01:30.291
-(sighs)
-You've reached Monica. Please
leave your name and number

01:30.424 --> 01:32.092
and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.

01:32.260 --> 01:34.362
-Thanks. Bye.
-(beeps)
-Hi. It's Linda.

01:34.495 --> 01:35.896
Can you give me a call?

01:36.029 --> 01:37.398
It's important.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.099
I'll try paging you.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.241
MALE VOICE:
Welcome to SkyPager.

01:47.375 --> 01:48.442
Please enter
your telephone number

01:48.609 --> 01:49.743
-or numeric message.
-(sighs)

01:49.877 --> 01:51.545
Then press pound.

01:54.348 --> 01:56.817
I spoke with Janet Reno.
It's official.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.052
Our jurisdiction
has been broadened

01:59.187 --> 02:00.954
to include this matter
of Monica Lewinsky.

02:01.088 --> 02:02.390
Ah. Great.

02:02.523 --> 02:03.824
We're set to brace Lewinsky
today

02:03.957 --> 02:05.893
at the Ritz-Carlton
in Pentagon City.

02:06.026 --> 02:07.795
-Emmick's gonna take point.
-What?

02:07.928 --> 02:10.398
-Why not you?
-Well, apparently,
the consensus in the office is

02:10.531 --> 02:11.565
that I'm too frightening.

02:11.699 --> 02:13.467
So I've been told
to stay in the van.

02:13.634 --> 02:14.968
(chuckles softly)

02:16.003 --> 02:19.006
(grunts)
What is our timeline?

02:19.139 --> 02:20.641
Well, Isikoff at Newsweek
has the whole story,

02:20.774 --> 02:22.243
and they go to print
in 48 hours.

02:22.376 --> 02:23.811
Mm, President Clinton
goes under oath

02:23.944 --> 02:25.313
first thing in the morning,

02:25.446 --> 02:27.581
so we need her to make
these monitored calls

02:27.715 --> 02:29.116
this afternoon at the latest.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.150
We'll be back with her quick.

02:30.318 --> 02:31.919
Young girl, white-collar crime--

02:32.052 --> 02:33.987
flip a witness like that
in less than an hour.

02:34.121 --> 02:36.156
So what now?

02:36.290 --> 02:37.658
We're waiting
for Linda Tripp to confirm,

02:37.791 --> 02:40.294
but Prom Night's set to start
at 12:45.

02:40.428 --> 02:41.329
Prom Night?

02:41.495 --> 02:42.663
That's what we're calling it.

02:42.796 --> 02:44.665
Operation Prom Night.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.002
Half hour with a girl
in a hotel room.

02:49.136 --> 02:50.838
(chuckles softly)

02:56.244 --> 02:58.279
(phone ringing)

03:04.017 --> 03:05.353
Hello?

03:05.519 --> 03:06.887
-MONICA: Sorry. Hi, I'm here.
-(sighs)

03:07.020 --> 03:08.856
Where on God's green earth?
(scoffs)

03:08.989 --> 03:11.024
I was working out. Jesus, Linda.

03:11.158 --> 03:12.360
Oh, your discipline.

03:12.493 --> 03:14.862
You make me feel like a slob.
(chuckles softly)

03:14.995 --> 03:17.365
Listen, can you do lunch
in an hour?

03:17.531 --> 03:18.366
I'm in the middle of packing.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.000
Monica...

03:20.133 --> 03:21.502
(exhales)
I have good news.

03:21.635 --> 03:24.004
I might've found a solution
for our problem.

03:24.137 --> 03:25.005
Really?

03:25.138 --> 03:26.540
Let's meet in the food court.

03:26.674 --> 03:28.376
-Pentagon City.
-(clicks)

03:32.846 --> 03:34.348
(lock beeps)

03:36.317 --> 03:38.552
Hello, everybody.
What do you got for me?

03:38.719 --> 03:41.054
On the girl's affidavit here,
it says she has a lawyer.

03:41.188 --> 03:42.923
Frank Carter.
Do we have to involve him?

03:43.056 --> 03:44.892
No. She met Carter
through Vernon Jordan.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.927
Anything she tells him is gonna
get back to the White House.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.062
We need to keep her
from making any contact.

03:49.196 --> 03:50.898
Okay. Fine.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.466
Thank you.

03:54.468 --> 03:55.736
Linda Tripp called.

03:55.869 --> 03:57.305
She's running behind.

03:58.306 --> 04:00.374
Who runs late
to a sting operation?

04:00.508 --> 04:02.543
* *

04:26.033 --> 04:27.267
Hello again.

04:27.401 --> 04:28.736
(exhales)
The Metro.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.103
Absolute catastrophe.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.772
Sorry for the delay.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.341
Are you ready?

04:37.277 --> 04:38.779
Everything okay?

04:42.916 --> 04:44.418
It's the right thing to do.

04:44.552 --> 04:46.019
(elevator dings)

04:53.093 --> 04:54.294
Coming?

04:58.732 --> 05:00.734
* *

05:06.640 --> 05:07.975
Where will you be?

05:08.108 --> 05:10.578
We'll be right behind you
the whole time.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.079
What do I say to her?

05:12.212 --> 05:13.981
You don't have to say anything.

05:14.948 --> 05:17.050
* *

05:23.591 --> 05:24.892
(sniffles)

05:47.481 --> 05:50.150
Ms. Lewinsky, we're agents
with the Federal Bureau

05:50.283 --> 05:51.719
of Investigation,

05:51.852 --> 05:53.954
authorized by the attorney
general to investigate crimes

05:54.087 --> 05:56.490
committed in relation
to the Paula Jones lawsuit.

05:56.624 --> 05:57.691
Linda.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.860
* *

06:08.135 --> 06:10.971
EMMICK:
Ms. Lewinsky, you're under
investigation for your conduct

06:11.104 --> 06:13.641
in relation
to the Paula Jones lawsuit.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.342
We believe that you have

06:15.476 --> 06:18.378
committed
multiple federal crimes--

06:18.546 --> 06:20.714
perjury, obstruction of justice,

06:20.848 --> 06:22.483
subornation of perjury,

06:22.616 --> 06:25.185
witness tampering
and conspiracy.

06:25.318 --> 06:27.320
These crimes are felonies.

06:27.455 --> 06:29.890
-Most have five-year minimums.
-(breathing heavily)

06:30.023 --> 06:34.161
All told, you could be looking
at 28 years in prison.

06:34.294 --> 06:35.663
(shudders)

06:35.796 --> 06:37.364
Ms. Lewinsky,

06:37.498 --> 06:40.668
you'll want to focus
so that we can get to...

06:40.801 --> 06:42.102
Let's just get a handle on this.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.370
Close the doors.

06:43.504 --> 06:46.239
(creaking)

06:46.373 --> 06:49.342
-(doors close)
-(shuddering)

06:49.477 --> 06:51.411
Just have a seat.

06:53.681 --> 06:55.248
If you could sit tight.

06:56.316 --> 06:57.751
Thank you.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.761
-(clinking)
-(water pouring)

07:10.764 --> 07:12.432
Water?

07:22.175 --> 07:24.512
Does that look familiar?

07:25.613 --> 07:27.247
(inhales)
How do you have this?

07:27.380 --> 07:29.449
Let's talk about what it says.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.118
Right here, it says

07:31.251 --> 07:34.054
you never had a sexual
relationship with Bill Clinton.

07:34.187 --> 07:35.956
Monica, we know that's a lie.

07:36.123 --> 07:39.259
We have everything we need
to prosecute you right now

07:39.392 --> 07:41.128
for filing this false affidavit.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.931
Now, look, I know
that you've been manipulated

07:44.064 --> 07:48.101
into this situation by
some really intimidating people,

07:48.235 --> 07:50.137
and I want
to get you out of this.

07:50.270 --> 07:53.340
And the way I can do that
is if you agree

07:53.473 --> 07:55.776
to cooperate
with our investigation.

07:55.909 --> 07:59.312
I, uh... I sh-should have,
uh, m-my lawyer here.

07:59.446 --> 08:00.981
His name is Frank Carter.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.483
Yep, yep, you can get a lawyer
if you want a lawyer.

08:03.617 --> 08:07.087
But we can make this easier and
I can give you more information

08:07.220 --> 08:09.256
if we just keep this
between us right now.

08:09.389 --> 08:11.324
So why don't you let me
walk you through

08:11.458 --> 08:13.761
-what cooperation
would look like, okay?
-(door opens)

08:13.894 --> 08:15.328
-Okay.
-(door closes)

08:15.462 --> 08:17.831
(quietly):
The lawyer's name is Frank...

08:17.965 --> 08:19.533
(inhales)

08:19.667 --> 08:21.501
We will go to our office,

08:21.669 --> 08:23.537
where we will do
what is called a debriefing.

08:23.671 --> 08:27.440
Basically, you will tell us
every single instance

08:27.575 --> 08:29.810
that you interacted
with the president.

08:29.943 --> 08:33.180
After that,
you will make three phone calls.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.015
Each call will be recorded.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.150
You will call Betty Currie,

08:37.284 --> 08:38.852
you will call Vernon Jordan

08:39.019 --> 08:40.854
and then President Clinton.

08:41.021 --> 08:41.855
What?

08:41.989 --> 08:42.856
Don't worry.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.058
We will coach you through it.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.293
Who would do that?

08:46.426 --> 08:48.696
No, I can't.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.864
I'm not doing that.
You cannot make me do that.

09:10.618 --> 09:12.485
(inhales)
How do you have these?

09:12.620 --> 09:16.556
Monica, you need to understand
the situation that you are in.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.058
Press play.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.229
LINDA:
I need to know
what you're thinking.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.897
About your affidavit.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.600
Are you still planning to lie?

09:26.734 --> 09:28.401
MONICA:
I already signed it.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.004
My thing with him
was personal and private

09:31.138 --> 09:34.541
and it has... absolutely
nothing to do with Paula Jones.

09:34.675 --> 09:36.543
And I-I really thought about it.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.111
-And maybe if this were a...
-Turn it off.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.412
...a serious lawsuit,

09:39.546 --> 09:41.248
-I would feel differently.
-Turn it off.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.417
-(clicks)
-I don't understand
why you have this,

09:44.584 --> 09:46.519
and I don't understand
what is happening.

09:46.654 --> 09:48.689
Why is this happen...

09:54.728 --> 09:57.798
Linda, what did you do?!

09:57.931 --> 09:59.466
(breathing heavily)

10:00.433 --> 10:02.435
(crying):
I feel sick. (gags)

10:02.602 --> 10:05.105
-EMMICK:
Someone get her a trash can.
-I feel sick. I feel sick.

10:05.238 --> 10:06.373
(crying)

10:06.506 --> 10:08.408
No. No, no, I can't.

10:08.541 --> 10:10.110
-IRONS: Let's clear the room.
-I can't think.

10:10.243 --> 10:11.912
I can't think.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.613
I'm going insane.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.415
-I'm going fucking insane.
-(doors close)

10:15.548 --> 10:16.684
Do you understand that?

10:16.817 --> 10:18.952
-Monica,
I know that you don't...
-Please! Please.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.889
-You have to make it stop
right now. Please.
-O...

10:22.022 --> 10:23.290
Okay. That's what I'm here for.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.458
-You can't tell anyone.
-Okay? Monica,

10:25.592 --> 10:27.795
-you need to focus now
on your decision.
-(gasping)

10:27.961 --> 10:29.596
-Okay?
-Everyone's gonna find out
about this.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.800
My dad. My family.
Oh, my God, Betty.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.235
Betty. What's gonna happen
to Betty and Vernon and...

10:35.368 --> 10:37.404
(crying)

10:39.272 --> 10:41.408
(inhales deeply, exhales)

10:41.541 --> 10:43.410
-(breathing heavily)
-Monica, you need to calm down.

10:43.543 --> 10:44.745
Okay?

10:44.878 --> 10:47.414
You need to focus now
on your decision.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.453
My life is over.

10:53.586 --> 10:55.322
Not at all.

10:55.455 --> 10:56.957
No.
You don't understand.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.392
-No. Monica, it's not.
-(sniffling)

11:01.161 --> 11:03.096
-Monica.
-(quietly): Carter's
on the phone.

11:03.230 --> 11:05.298
Monica, I have been
a prosecutor for 20 years.

11:05.432 --> 11:08.135
I see people in your position
all the time.

11:08.268 --> 11:09.369
You're in shock.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.038
That is normal.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.539
-(breathing heavily)
-I will get you through this.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.142
I will make sure
that you are okay.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.010
I promise.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.545
(shudders)

11:18.678 --> 11:20.580
What if I kill myself?

11:22.015 --> 11:23.350
Monica.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.152
MONICA:
No, tell me.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.921
If I kill myself,
will this all go away?

11:28.989 --> 11:31.158
(shudders)
If I jump out this window,

11:31.291 --> 11:33.160
tell me, what would happen?

11:34.327 --> 11:36.864
(inhales, exhales)

11:36.997 --> 11:39.532
This case is not going away.

11:41.101 --> 11:43.871
(inhales)
I want to talk to my lawyer.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.507
Okay.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.709
Okay, we can... we can do that.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.144
But we need to know

11:51.278 --> 11:53.046
whether or not
you're going to cooperate

11:53.213 --> 11:54.381
with this investigation,
all right?

11:54.514 --> 11:56.649
It is time-sensitive.

11:56.784 --> 11:57.851
Why is it time-sensitive?

11:57.985 --> 11:59.887
(pager beeping)

12:03.490 --> 12:05.325
Who is it?

12:06.559 --> 12:09.362
It's my mom.
I need to call her.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.166
Okay.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.102
Okay, we will go to the office.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.904
You can call your mother,
you can call a lawyer

12:17.070 --> 12:18.738
and we'll talk through
everything, okay?

12:18.872 --> 12:20.908
Why don't you gather
your belongings.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.911
It's just a short drive
downtown.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.913
Um...

12:26.079 --> 12:28.248
can I go to the bathroom?

12:31.184 --> 12:33.553
-(sniffs)
-Everything from your pockets.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.256
(sniffles)

12:38.091 --> 12:39.927
(sniffles)

12:40.093 --> 12:41.428
Okay.

12:48.235 --> 12:50.270
(breathing heavily)

13:01.248 --> 13:02.615
Go ahead.

13:06.353 --> 13:08.588
(breathing heavily)

13:11.024 --> 13:12.259
(shudders)

13:12.860 --> 13:14.294
(whimpers)

13:15.528 --> 13:16.629
(stomps foot)

13:19.766 --> 13:21.134
(sighs)

13:21.268 --> 13:22.635
We should be on our way.

13:22.769 --> 13:24.171
What do you want to do?

13:24.304 --> 13:26.473
I'm not sure.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.642
What do we do about...?

13:32.079 --> 13:34.147
(sighs)

13:35.215 --> 13:36.649
We're good.

13:36.783 --> 13:37.918
Thank you, Mrs. Tripp.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.786
We'll follow up later.

13:41.788 --> 13:43.490
You can leave now.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.495
* *

13:54.501 --> 13:56.503
(breathing heavily)

13:59.806 --> 14:01.841
(exhales, sniffles)

14:05.946 --> 14:07.981
* *

14:31.304 --> 14:34.207
Are you fellows
on your way back?

14:34.341 --> 14:36.209
EMMICK:
We have a problem.
She's refusing to come in.

14:36.343 --> 14:38.045
You showed her what you have?

14:38.178 --> 14:40.213
Yeah.
(exhales)

14:40.347 --> 14:41.548
We'll figure it out.

14:41.681 --> 14:43.350
Keep me apprised.

14:45.152 --> 14:48.055
Neille, can you please get me
Jackie Bennett

14:48.221 --> 14:49.889
on his cell phone?

14:55.295 --> 14:56.563
(exhales)

15:00.633 --> 15:01.501
(chuckles softly)

15:01.634 --> 15:03.136
Where is she?

15:04.504 --> 15:05.738
She's in there.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.874
In here?

15:15.048 --> 15:16.249
(exhales)

15:17.217 --> 15:19.052
Ms. Lewinsky.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.690
Follow me.

15:31.331 --> 15:32.932
Sit down.

15:38.905 --> 15:40.240
(Bennett inhales)

15:42.509 --> 15:43.776
I work with Mike.

15:43.910 --> 15:45.778
I know he's informed you
of the evidence against you.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.048
Candidly, I've heard the tapes.

15:48.181 --> 15:49.082
All of 'em.

15:49.216 --> 15:50.117
All of 'em?
How many tapes...

15:50.250 --> 15:51.818
Scuse me.
I speak,

15:51.951 --> 15:53.453
you listen.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.055
That's what's happening here.

15:59.759 --> 16:01.995
Mike has offered you a way
to save yourself.

16:02.129 --> 16:04.297
But we need to hear from you
right now.

16:04.431 --> 16:06.399
Do we have a deal?

16:08.735 --> 16:10.670
I don't know about the law.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.473
I don't know what to do
without talking to my lawyer.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.142
Frank Carter's a civil attorney.

16:15.275 --> 16:17.577
You're the target
of a criminal investigation.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.179
Frank Carter
will be useless to you.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.514
Can I at least call Frank
and maybe he could recommend

16:21.648 --> 16:22.782
-someone...
-No.

16:22.915 --> 16:24.417
Ms. Lewinsky,
listen to me very carefully.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.286
Okay?
(inhales)

16:26.419 --> 16:30.157
You have taken part
in a conspiracy.

16:30.323 --> 16:33.093
We know Frank Carter and
Vernon Jordan are both involved.

16:33.226 --> 16:34.694
Now, if you think
it's a good idea

16:34.827 --> 16:38.031
to call up a coconspirator
right now, go.

16:38.165 --> 16:39.832
Be my guest.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.171
(exhales)
Then I want to talk to my mom.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.339
What?

16:46.506 --> 16:49.142
She's been paging me.
I always call her back.

16:49.276 --> 16:51.344
And I'm sure she'll be fine.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.047
She'll call the police

16:54.181 --> 16:56.183
if she doesn't hear from me.

16:58.918 --> 17:00.687
-Fallon, get the phone.
-No.

17:00.820 --> 17:03.022
No, I want to talk to her
in private.

17:03.156 --> 17:04.224
No.
You say hello,

17:04.357 --> 17:06.126
you're all right,
you'll call her later.

17:06.259 --> 17:07.294
Now go.

17:10.330 --> 17:11.498
I said go!

17:18.871 --> 17:20.039
(shudders)

17:20.207 --> 17:22.209
(exhales, sniffles)

17:23.710 --> 17:24.811
(dialing)

17:24.944 --> 17:26.646
(shudders)

17:32.385 --> 17:33.853
DEBRA:
Marilu Henner

17:33.986 --> 17:35.755
is in Chicago.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.725
Say she doesn't have the fizz
of Ann Reinking.

17:38.858 --> 17:41.561
-Can we go see that Lion King?
-(phone ringing)

17:41.694 --> 17:44.063
MARCIA:
I think those are
still impossible to get, Mom.

17:44.197 --> 17:46.133
Oh. Really?

17:48.868 --> 17:50.837
(phone continues ringing)

17:50.970 --> 17:51.838
Hello?

17:51.971 --> 17:53.406
-Hi.
-Oh, there you are,

17:53.540 --> 17:55.408
Monica. I've been calling.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.210
Uh...

17:57.344 --> 17:59.246
Yeah, um...

18:01.214 --> 18:03.283
I'm, uh... I'm at the mall.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.851
Okay.

18:04.984 --> 18:07.587
Well, me, Mom and Deb
have been trying to figure out

18:07.720 --> 18:09.522
what show
we were gonna see tonight.

18:09.656 --> 18:10.923
I'm sorry.

18:11.057 --> 18:12.959
I, um...

18:13.092 --> 18:14.427
(inhales sharply)

18:14.594 --> 18:15.895
I'll call you later.

18:16.028 --> 18:17.597
All right.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.199
-Bye.
-Wait.

18:19.332 --> 18:20.767
-Mom?
-Yes?

18:25.238 --> 18:26.473
I love you.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.442
Oh. I love you, too, Dotcha.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.544
(shudders, exhales)

18:33.846 --> 18:35.248
(beeps)

18:37.049 --> 18:38.818
BENNETT:
Okay.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.620
You've made your call.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.155
You've had time to think.

18:42.289 --> 18:43.623
You need to decide.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.158
Yes or no.

18:45.292 --> 18:47.294
I can't go to jail.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.496
-Okay. Good.
-(breathing heavily)

18:49.629 --> 18:51.331
Then you come back to our office

18:51.464 --> 18:53.800
and either you start
on the monitored phone calls

18:53.933 --> 18:55.802
or you wear a body wire
and you go see them in person.

18:55.935 --> 18:58.638
I can't.
I can't trap Betty and Vernon.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.940
-I just...
I will not do that to them.
-Too bad!

19:01.073 --> 19:02.809
That's what we need from you!

19:02.975 --> 19:04.377
(panting softly)

19:06.479 --> 19:08.248
If you want our help.
(chuckles)

19:08.381 --> 19:10.583
Or you can try your luck
in federal prison, huh?

19:10.717 --> 19:13.453
-I don't understand how I'm
supposed to make this decision.
-No. No.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.154
We are not going in circles
anymore.

19:15.322 --> 19:18.258
I just want to talk to Frank
or at least my mom

19:18.391 --> 19:20.460
without you hovering over me.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.028
You're 24.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.496
You're a smart girl.

19:23.630 --> 19:26.833
You don't need
your fucking mommy to decide.

19:29.135 --> 19:30.503
(chuckling softly)

19:30.670 --> 19:33.005
Well, then you should know I'm
leaning towards not cooperating.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.207
Oh, yeah?

19:34.341 --> 19:36.175
Okay.

19:36.309 --> 19:37.877
Well, you should know
we're leaning towards

19:38.010 --> 19:39.679
prosecuting your mother as well.

19:39.812 --> 19:42.549
-No. No.
-Yeah. We believe
she knew about the affair

19:42.682 --> 19:44.551
-and your false affidavit, hmm?
-No.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.353
-No, not my mom.
She's not involved.
-Huh.

19:46.486 --> 19:47.720
Jury can decide that.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.522
Either way, I can make
the next year of her life

19:49.656 --> 19:51.023
a living hell.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.728
I want to talk to my mom
right now,

19:55.862 --> 19:57.230
and I do not want
to be recorded.

19:57.364 --> 19:58.531
This is fucking ridiculous!

19:58.698 --> 20:00.367
Can we just calm down?

20:00.533 --> 20:02.201
Monica,

20:02.335 --> 20:04.036
you can go back into this room.

20:04.170 --> 20:05.438
You're not gonna be recorded.

20:05.572 --> 20:08.841
You can have privacy.
I will close the doors. Okay?

20:10.277 --> 20:11.478
I want to call her downstairs.

20:11.611 --> 20:14.814
-(sighs)
-I will come right back up here.

20:14.947 --> 20:16.048
I just want
to talk to her by myself.

20:16.182 --> 20:17.684
I promise you, I promise you,

20:17.817 --> 20:19.719
I will come right back upstairs.

20:27.026 --> 20:28.528
(shudders)

20:28.661 --> 20:31.698
(chuckles) Are you gonna arrest
me if I walk out of the room?

20:35.335 --> 20:37.003
You have 30 minutes.

20:38.004 --> 20:39.839
(sniffles, exhales)

20:40.573 --> 20:42.642
(breathing heavily)

20:44.711 --> 20:46.012
Monica.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.250
Listen, this is important, okay?

20:51.418 --> 20:53.252
Your mother is not to share

20:53.386 --> 20:55.355
anything you tell her
with anyone.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.357
A lawyer. Anyone.
And if she does

20:57.490 --> 20:59.225
and word gets out...

21:00.827 --> 21:02.295
...you're in this on your own.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.096
Understood?

21:06.933 --> 21:08.368
Okay, go.

21:08.501 --> 21:10.169
(sniffles)

21:12.605 --> 21:13.440
Nice.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.141
We're never gonna see her again.

21:15.274 --> 21:18.144
(panting)

21:18.277 --> 21:19.479
(elevator dings, doors open)

21:19.612 --> 21:21.614
(panting)

21:27.454 --> 21:29.456
(breathing heavily)

21:38.230 --> 21:39.966
* *

22:09.396 --> 22:11.431
(panting)

22:13.165 --> 22:14.467
(sniffles)

22:14.601 --> 22:16.669
(panting)

22:21.007 --> 22:23.009
(panting)

22:24.143 --> 22:27.179
Pick up, pick up,
pick up, pick up.

22:27.313 --> 22:28.848
(line ringing)

22:29.015 --> 22:30.683
(phone rings)

22:30.850 --> 22:32.619
-(beeps)
-Hello?

22:32.752 --> 22:34.153
Mom.

22:34.286 --> 22:35.522
Oh, Monica.

22:35.688 --> 22:36.856
(sniffles)
It's bad.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.157
I'm in trouble.

22:38.290 --> 22:39.726
-I don't know what to do.
-Slow down.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.360
Slow down, sweetheart.
What's going on?

22:41.494 --> 22:43.830
Marcia, is everything okay?

22:43.963 --> 22:45.698
The FBI has me.

22:45.832 --> 22:47.900
-And Ken Starr and...
-Ken Starr?

22:48.034 --> 22:49.569
What are you talking about,
sweetheart?

22:49.702 --> 22:51.237
Like, wh-where are you?

22:51.370 --> 22:53.005
It's Linda.
(shudders)

22:53.139 --> 22:55.007
-She told them I lied.
-Honey,

22:55.141 --> 22:56.709
where are you right now?

22:56.843 --> 22:58.711
(sobbing):
Pentagon City.

22:58.845 --> 23:00.647
They came up to me...

23:00.780 --> 23:03.883
and they took me
to a hotel room in the Ritz.

23:04.016 --> 23:06.218
And they let me
come call you in the mall,

23:06.352 --> 23:08.187
-but I have to go back up.
-Oh, okay, okay.

23:08.320 --> 23:09.388
Listen to me right now.

23:09.522 --> 23:10.823
You're gonna call your lawyer
right now.

23:10.957 --> 23:11.858
All right, sweetheart?

23:11.991 --> 23:13.192
They won't let me.

23:13.325 --> 23:14.360
What?

23:14.494 --> 23:15.828
I think
that they may be watching.

23:15.962 --> 23:17.063
I really have to go, okay?

23:17.229 --> 23:18.330
What are you talking about?

23:18.465 --> 23:20.232
Why wouldn't they let you call
your lawyer?

23:21.367 --> 23:22.334
I have to call Betty

23:22.469 --> 23:23.570
and I have to warn him.

23:23.703 --> 23:25.404
No, you will not call him,
Monica.

23:25.538 --> 23:26.405
Do you hear me?

23:26.539 --> 23:27.406
Listen to me now.

23:27.574 --> 23:28.741
You go back up there

23:28.908 --> 23:30.543
and you tell them
not to do anything.

23:30.677 --> 23:32.912
You tell them that I am coming
and you tell them to wait.

23:33.045 --> 23:34.747
Okay, I have to go.

23:34.881 --> 23:35.848
(shrieks)

23:35.982 --> 23:38.050
(sniffles)

23:38.184 --> 23:39.418
(groans)

23:39.586 --> 23:42.254
(breathing heavily)

23:42.421 --> 23:44.223
(indistinct chatter)

23:44.356 --> 23:46.092
(sighs)

23:52.198 --> 23:54.601
* *

24:09.415 --> 24:11.450
* *

24:50.289 --> 24:52.324
(jangling)

25:10.509 --> 25:12.011
(rapid footfalls)

25:12.178 --> 25:14.313
Hey. Can I take the van...

25:17.817 --> 25:19.185
Are you okay?

25:21.654 --> 25:23.590
What's going on?

25:25.357 --> 25:26.859
Nothing.

25:27.026 --> 25:30.062
Oh, there are some,
uh, men coming over,

25:30.196 --> 25:32.198
some attorneys.

25:32.331 --> 25:34.200
They need to ask me questions.

25:34.366 --> 25:35.635
Again?

25:35.768 --> 25:37.536
Different attorneys.

25:39.205 --> 25:41.373
I can't explain it all to you
right now.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.042
Just asking.

25:45.477 --> 25:47.680
You look
like you're about to cry.

25:47.814 --> 25:50.850
Allison,
go back upstairs, please.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.223
(exhales)

25:58.524 --> 26:00.559
(muttering quickly)

26:05.031 --> 26:07.233
(quietly): We bombard
the prostate with the beam...

26:07.366 --> 26:09.401
Dr. Lewinsky,
your ex-wife's calling.

26:09.535 --> 26:12.504
She says it's urgent. Monica's
in some kind of trouble.

26:13.472 --> 26:14.573
(sighs)

26:14.741 --> 26:17.109
Yeah, hi. Listen,
I'm about to give a talk.

26:17.243 --> 26:20.246
Forget your talk, Bernie.
The Feds have Monica.

26:25.718 --> 26:27.586
We'll give her ten more minutes.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.922
She's not coming back.

26:30.056 --> 26:31.423
(soft knocking)

26:42.869 --> 26:44.070
My mom is coming.

26:44.203 --> 26:45.271
What?

26:45.437 --> 26:46.272
She said not to do anything

26:46.438 --> 26:48.474
until she gets here.

26:48.607 --> 26:51.343
Her train gets in at 8:50.
She just paged.

26:52.378 --> 26:53.379
But that's...

26:53.512 --> 26:55.281
that's four hours from now.

26:55.414 --> 26:57.449
There are flights out
of New York constantly.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.118
-She doesn't like to fly.
-(Bennett laughs)

26:59.285 --> 27:00.619
(chuckles)

27:00.787 --> 27:03.122
Unbelievable.
Fucking unbelievable.

27:04.123 --> 27:05.424
Where do you want me to wait?

27:06.425 --> 27:08.260
Let's put you in the other room.

27:16.202 --> 27:17.303
Thank you.

27:20.707 --> 27:22.141
My God.

27:22.308 --> 27:25.644
When you said FBI on the phone,
I thought Pentagon job, Defense.

27:25.812 --> 27:28.314
Maybe she got drawn
into espionage, you know?

27:28.447 --> 27:30.116
But this is, uh...

27:30.249 --> 27:32.184
-far worse.
-I know.

27:32.318 --> 27:33.820
That's why I asked you
to leave your deposition

27:33.986 --> 27:35.321
and come meet me here.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.089
(chuckles) I can't believe
they actually have

27:37.223 --> 27:38.925
-prostate conventions like this.
-Bill,

27:39.058 --> 27:40.659
-no jokes.
-I apologize.

27:40.827 --> 27:42.661
I'm sorry.

27:42.795 --> 27:45.364
-So how long were she
and Clinton having this...
-I don't know.

27:45.497 --> 27:48.367
-Well, did Marcia know about it?
I mean, before today?
-(door opens, closes)

27:48.500 --> 27:49.568
Don't know.
(clears throat)

27:52.839 --> 27:54.340
Right over here. Thanks.

27:57.176 --> 27:58.644
Thank you.

28:01.981 --> 28:04.683
(door opens, closes)

28:04.817 --> 28:06.352
So what did Marcia say?

28:06.485 --> 28:08.855
What happened so that Monica and
Clinton ever actually ended up

28:08.988 --> 28:10.356
in a room alone together?

28:10.522 --> 28:12.024
Bill, I don't know.

28:12.191 --> 28:14.026
I wasn't focused on that.
I was focused on the fact

28:14.193 --> 28:16.328
that the FBI has my child.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.364
(sighs)
Marcia's on her way over there.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.900
God knows
what she's supposed to do.

28:21.033 --> 28:23.135
What am I supposed to do?

28:23.269 --> 28:24.370
All right.

28:24.536 --> 28:26.205
Step one...

28:29.541 --> 28:31.443
...you medicate.

28:32.478 --> 28:33.579
Just throw it down.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.214
(clinks)

28:40.887 --> 28:43.389
(sighs deeply)

28:45.191 --> 28:47.059
Step two,

28:47.193 --> 28:48.527
I'll take over.

28:48.660 --> 28:49.796
I can handle this thing easy.

28:49.929 --> 28:51.998
Whole thing sounds
fucking ridiculous anyway.

28:52.131 --> 28:53.599
-Really?
-Absolutely. Federal prison

28:53.732 --> 28:55.367
for lying about an affair?

28:55.501 --> 28:57.736
In a civil case?
(chuckles softly)

28:57.870 --> 29:00.873
I'd wager my AMG that nobody's
ever been prosecuted for that

29:01.007 --> 29:03.209
in the whole history
of the republic.

29:14.420 --> 29:15.687
Bernie, look at me.

29:18.825 --> 29:21.260
I've been your lawyer
for a long time.

29:22.261 --> 29:23.295
I love you, man.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.697
Love you like a brother.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.101
You call Marcia.

29:29.268 --> 29:30.602
You tell her,
when she gets to D.C.,

29:30.769 --> 29:34.406
she dials me up
and puts me on with these guys.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.209
I swear to you

29:37.343 --> 29:39.979
I am going to fix this.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.048
BENNETT (quietly):
Bullshit. She doesn't want
her mom here.

29:42.181 --> 29:43.615
She knows we have
this one tiny window

29:43.782 --> 29:45.251
-to do monitored calls.
-I don't know.

29:45.384 --> 29:47.920
Bill Clinton sits for
his deposition tomorrow morning.

29:48.054 --> 29:50.789
She is running out the clock,
and the mother's in on it.

29:50.923 --> 29:52.458
She said her mom doesn't fly.

29:52.591 --> 29:54.560
Are you fucking kidding me?
She's from California.

29:54.693 --> 29:55.828
How the hell'd she get
to New York?

29:55.962 --> 29:57.629
Don't be such
an easy fucking mark.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.966
What's our alternative,
Jackie? Huh?

30:00.132 --> 30:02.134
You want to go back in there and
work some more of your magic?

30:02.268 --> 30:03.802
Maybe you can make her cry
again.

30:03.970 --> 30:05.804
That was amazing.

30:05.972 --> 30:08.107
We don't have a choice.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.308
Okay?

30:09.441 --> 30:11.477
(scoffs)

30:17.783 --> 30:19.318
(footsteps approaching)

30:22.488 --> 30:24.123
(sighs)

30:32.598 --> 30:34.766
Okay, we'll wait
for your mother.

30:36.135 --> 30:37.669
Thank you.

30:37.803 --> 30:39.671
I'm sorry.

30:41.440 --> 30:42.808
(inhales)

30:42.942 --> 30:45.011
(exhales)

30:45.177 --> 30:47.046
I'm gonna need a coffee.

30:47.179 --> 30:48.780
Do you want anything? Like a...

30:48.915 --> 30:50.149
-Coke?
-Yeah,

30:50.282 --> 30:51.550
a coffee would be great.

30:51.683 --> 30:52.751
Thanks.

30:55.254 --> 30:56.255
(sighs)

30:56.388 --> 30:58.457
-(phone clicks in cradle)
-(dialing)

31:01.327 --> 31:03.963
Uh, yes. Can we please have
coffee service

31:04.096 --> 31:05.664
brought up to the room?

31:07.033 --> 31:08.634
Thank you.

31:11.170 --> 31:14.040
If it's okay, um,
my mom was asking why

31:14.173 --> 31:15.674
I can't call my lawyer.

31:17.509 --> 31:18.877
What?

31:19.979 --> 31:21.047
Well...

31:21.213 --> 31:23.715
she asked me to call him,
and I-I told her

31:23.882 --> 31:25.317
-that you guys said I couldn't.
-Oh, no, no, no.

31:25.451 --> 31:26.885
We never said that you couldn't.

31:27.053 --> 31:28.687
You're going undercover,
so it's crucial

31:28.820 --> 31:30.889
to keep it to a few people.
But it is your choice, Monica.

31:31.023 --> 31:32.791
I explicitly told you that.

31:34.026 --> 31:35.394
Oh.

31:35.527 --> 31:37.063
Okay.

31:43.402 --> 31:44.903
You want to call your lawyer?

31:47.173 --> 31:48.540
Yes.

31:48.674 --> 31:50.709
(line ringing)

31:54.680 --> 31:55.814
RECEPTIONIST:
Carter-Verrone.

31:55.948 --> 31:57.549
-Yes. Frank Carter, please.
-I'm sorry.

31:57.683 --> 31:59.018
He's left for the day.

31:59.151 --> 32:00.219
May I take a message?

32:00.352 --> 32:01.720
Oh, um...

32:01.853 --> 32:03.922
No, thanks.
I'll-I'll try back another time.

32:04.090 --> 32:06.558
I'm authorized to page
Mr. Carter after-hours

32:06.692 --> 32:07.759
with anything urgent.

32:07.893 --> 32:09.595
Is this an urgent matter?

32:10.596 --> 32:11.897
No. Thank you.

32:12.031 --> 32:13.565
(door closes)

32:13.699 --> 32:15.534
(phone clicks in cradle)

32:18.737 --> 32:20.606
Friday rush.

32:20.739 --> 32:23.409
(inhales)
Probably wanted to hit 495

32:23.542 --> 32:26.578
before it turned into
a parking lot.

32:26.712 --> 32:29.948
Here's a public defender.

32:30.116 --> 32:32.451
If you want to go that route.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.789
I think I'll stick with Frank.

32:41.893 --> 32:43.562
(chuckles softly)

32:44.796 --> 32:47.333
Well, should we, uh...

32:47.466 --> 32:49.101
watch TV?

32:49.235 --> 32:51.637
(NYPD Blue theme playing)

32:59.878 --> 33:02.314
-(man speaking indistinctly)
-See what else is on.

33:03.315 --> 33:05.117
NEWSWOMAN:
President Bill Clinton
is scheduled to testify

33:05.251 --> 33:06.785
tomorrow morning in the...

33:06.918 --> 33:08.687
-* Ch-Ch-Ch-Chia. *
-ANNOUNCER: Chia Pet,

33:08.820 --> 33:09.788
the pottery that grows.

33:09.921 --> 33:11.690
It's fun and easy.

33:11.823 --> 33:14.160
Soak your Chia,
spread the seeds,

33:14.293 --> 33:16.662
keep it watered
and watch it grow.

33:16.795 --> 33:20.166
And now grow a whole collection
of fun with Chia Teddy Bears,

33:20.299 --> 33:21.967
Puppies, Kittens,

33:22.101 --> 33:23.602
Rams, Bulls.

33:23.735 --> 33:26.505
There's even a Chia Tree
to keep your pets company.

33:26.672 --> 33:29.007
-Chia Pets and Trees,
the pottery that grows.
-(breathing heavily)

33:29.175 --> 33:30.976
It's so hot in here.

33:31.110 --> 33:34.580
You already turned
the thermostat down two times.

33:39.151 --> 33:40.686
(sighs)

33:43.355 --> 33:45.824
Do we have to stay in here?

33:46.792 --> 33:48.827
(indistinct chatter)

33:52.131 --> 33:54.533
(breathing heavily)

33:56.702 --> 33:58.504
So what do you want to do?

33:59.471 --> 34:01.073
Um, I don't know.

34:01.207 --> 34:03.509
Uh, Crate and Barrel?

34:04.976 --> 34:07.179
(indistinct chatter)

34:07.313 --> 34:09.581
(footsteps approaching)

34:09.715 --> 34:11.350
Can I help you with anything?

34:11.483 --> 34:13.152
We're good. Thank you.

34:26.732 --> 34:27.899
What's that for?

34:28.033 --> 34:30.502
It's a decanter.

34:31.803 --> 34:33.239
You...

34:33.372 --> 34:35.107
You never seen a decanter?

34:35.241 --> 34:36.608
I don't do much shopping.

34:36.742 --> 34:39.077
Really?
You seem so comfortable in here.

34:40.379 --> 34:42.748
You take wine
in the perfectly...

34:42.881 --> 34:45.917
fine bottle it comes in
and you pour it into this.

34:46.051 --> 34:48.454
Then you pour it again
into an actual wineglass.

34:48.587 --> 34:50.021
(inhales)

34:50.156 --> 34:51.523
Seems weird.

34:51.657 --> 34:53.192
Yeah.
(chuckles softly)

34:53.325 --> 34:56.528
My grandma has crap like this
all over her place.

34:58.830 --> 35:01.600
My grandma's gonna be
so disappointed in me.

35:01.733 --> 35:03.402
Let's keep moving.

35:03.535 --> 35:05.537
What do you say?

35:15.247 --> 35:17.349
(indistinct chatter)

35:19.117 --> 35:20.619
(breathing heavily)

35:24.089 --> 35:27.593
Um, you know what, I have to use
the restroom real quick.

35:27.726 --> 35:29.328
Should we go back up
to the room?

35:29.461 --> 35:30.629
There's one in there.

35:30.762 --> 35:32.130
Just-just inside.

35:32.298 --> 35:34.433
I know my malls.

35:34.566 --> 35:36.835
Um, my mom's coming,
so I'll just...

35:36.968 --> 35:38.937
I'll just be one minute.

35:42.308 --> 35:43.675
We should follow.

35:43.809 --> 35:46.478
We have to be very careful
about that.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.816
She'll come back.

35:50.949 --> 35:52.818
* *

36:00.626 --> 36:03.161
Okay. Okay.
(panting)

36:05.096 --> 36:06.965
Betty, pick up.
(pants)

36:07.098 --> 36:08.467
(whispers):
Betty, pick up...

36:08.600 --> 36:09.801
BETTY (recorded):
You've reached the office

36:09.935 --> 36:11.169
-of the personal sec...
-Fuck!

36:11.337 --> 36:13.339
(panting)

36:16.442 --> 36:18.344
(whispers):
Come on, Betty. Please.

36:18.510 --> 36:21.012
BETTY (recorded):
This is the home
of Bob and Betty Currie.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.514
Please leave us a message.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.082
(beeps)

36:25.284 --> 36:26.852
(baby fussing quietly)

36:29.020 --> 36:30.356
(baby cries)

36:30.522 --> 36:32.157
Are you with them?

36:33.124 --> 36:35.160
(indistinct chatter)

36:36.695 --> 36:38.697
(breathing heavily)

36:43.201 --> 36:45.203
What now?

36:45.337 --> 36:46.204
WAITRESS:
Okay,

36:46.338 --> 36:47.873
we have a Pilgrim Burger.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.542
Chicken nacho pasta pie.

36:50.676 --> 36:52.378
Here.

36:52.511 --> 36:54.713
Bourbon teriyaki salmon.

36:54.880 --> 36:55.881
Thank you.

36:56.014 --> 36:57.182
Enjoy.

37:01.320 --> 37:02.721
Mmm.

37:07.125 --> 37:08.994
Why would it be 28 years?

37:10.161 --> 37:11.397
What?

37:11.563 --> 37:13.699
You said
I could go to jail for 28 years.

37:13.832 --> 37:14.866
Mm.

37:15.967 --> 37:16.902
To prison.

37:17.035 --> 37:18.236
Jail's where you go when you...

37:18.370 --> 37:19.605
(inhales)
get blasted

37:19.738 --> 37:21.740
-and you drive into a mailbox.
-(chuckles softly)

37:21.873 --> 37:23.074
Oh.

37:23.241 --> 37:24.576
Five years, perjury.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.412
Five years,
subornation of perjury.

37:26.578 --> 37:28.079
Obstruction of justice, five.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.214
Conspiracy, five.

37:29.348 --> 37:31.417
Filing a false affidavit, five.

37:31.550 --> 37:33.552
Tack on another three
for witness tampering.

37:33.685 --> 37:35.421
28 years.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.428
I'll never have kids.

37:48.434 --> 37:49.601
Uh...

37:49.735 --> 37:51.403
Don't say that.

37:52.738 --> 37:54.906
No one's ever gonna marry me.

37:56.375 --> 37:58.877
(inhales, clears throat)

37:59.010 --> 38:00.879
Monica...
(sniffs)

38:01.012 --> 38:03.949
it's only 28 years
if you face it without us.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.117
And that's not gonna happen.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.919
I know it may not look
like it now,

38:08.053 --> 38:10.556
but we are on your side on this.

38:10.689 --> 38:12.290
We are.

38:22.133 --> 38:24.135
* *

38:25.637 --> 38:27.706
(doorbell rings)

38:38.149 --> 38:39.951
-Hello, George.
-(Porter chuckles)

38:40.085 --> 38:41.319
What's in this bag?

38:41.487 --> 38:44.322
Dubs of the Tripp tapes.

38:44.456 --> 38:45.991
How many Tripp tapes?

38:46.124 --> 38:47.493
All 20 hours.

38:47.626 --> 38:49.327
What?
H-How did you get those?

38:49.461 --> 38:50.362
Don't ask,

38:50.496 --> 38:51.830
-don't tell.
-(Porter laughs)

38:51.997 --> 38:54.199
-Hey, what do you have tonight?
-I'm, uh,

38:54.332 --> 38:56.802
going to the Monocle
with Ingraham and David Brock.

38:56.935 --> 38:58.970
Ugh, you're canceling.
You're welcome.

38:59.104 --> 39:00.338
We're listening
straight through,

39:00.506 --> 39:01.940
every single one.

39:02.073 --> 39:03.008
Ice?

39:03.141 --> 39:04.643
Is that six bottles?

39:04.776 --> 39:05.844
Why would you get six bottles?

39:06.011 --> 39:08.313
Richard, come over here
and pop this.

39:08.447 --> 39:10.682
George, we're celebrating.

39:10.849 --> 39:14.152
These tapes are going to be
in the Smithsonian one day.

39:14.285 --> 39:16.522
We're living a page
in a U.S. history book.

39:16.688 --> 39:19.958
I'm just saying, maybe we
should hold off on celebrating

39:20.091 --> 39:22.694
until we know for sure there's
something usable on those tapes.

39:22.861 --> 39:25.531
This is a coup d'état
and we're the coup.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.032
Do you know how rare that is?

39:27.198 --> 39:28.900
If there was ever a night
to crack open

39:29.034 --> 39:31.737
something fucking decent,
it's now.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.705
We're starting.

39:36.475 --> 39:38.176
(scoffs softly)

39:39.978 --> 39:41.680
(sighs)
'Kay.

39:43.381 --> 39:44.516
(pops)

39:45.451 --> 39:46.384
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

39:46.552 --> 39:47.786
Cheers.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.559
-MONICA: Hello?
-LINDA: Hi.

39:53.692 --> 39:55.393
How are you?

39:55.561 --> 39:57.395
MONICA:
Fine. I'm tired.
I just got off the treadmill.

39:57.529 --> 39:59.130
LINDA: (chuckles softly)
You're so good.

40:05.971 --> 40:07.573
(inhales)

40:07.706 --> 40:09.741
(exhales)

40:09.875 --> 40:11.009
Mrs. Tripp.

40:11.142 --> 40:12.844
I'm Jim Fisher.
This is Wes Holmes.

40:12.978 --> 40:15.080
We're attorneys
for Mrs. Paula Jones.

40:17.683 --> 40:18.750
Come in.

40:23.922 --> 40:26.057
These are, uh...

40:26.191 --> 40:28.927
my, uh... my personal items
from the Pentagon.

40:29.094 --> 40:31.229
I asked a colleague
to bring them by.

40:31.362 --> 40:33.932
It's only a matter of days
till the president learns

40:34.065 --> 40:36.134
about all I've done.

40:36.267 --> 40:37.803
Well, that speaks
to why we're here.

40:37.936 --> 40:39.037
Um, tomorrow morning,

40:39.170 --> 40:40.572
the president
will be going under oath.

40:40.706 --> 40:42.140
I'll be asking him
specific questions

40:42.273 --> 40:44.876
about his relationships with
women like Ms. Monica Lewinsky.

40:45.010 --> 40:46.878
Any information you can give us
would be a great help.

40:47.012 --> 40:49.280
Gifts exchanged. Events
they attended at the same time.

40:49.414 --> 40:50.281
That sort of thing.

40:50.415 --> 40:51.416
She, uh...

40:51.550 --> 40:54.052
she'd see him in the Post
or, uh,

40:54.185 --> 40:56.221
on TV...
(chuckles)

40:56.354 --> 40:59.224
wearing one of the ties she
gave him and she'd be so happy.

40:59.357 --> 41:01.226
She believed it was a...

41:01.359 --> 41:04.563
a signal to her
to show he cared.

41:04.696 --> 41:05.831
(chuckles)

41:05.964 --> 41:08.099
She actually believed that.

41:08.233 --> 41:10.468
So she gave him multiple ties?

41:11.803 --> 41:13.805
She loves to shop.

41:16.307 --> 41:17.809
(inhales, exhales)

41:17.943 --> 41:19.010
She's a kid.

41:19.144 --> 41:21.112
She needed someone to save her.

41:21.246 --> 41:23.849
Were it my own daughter,
I'd have done the same thing.

41:23.982 --> 41:26.518
Can't expect her
to understand that now, but...

41:26.652 --> 41:29.688
that's how she is.
She's, uh, entitled.

41:29.821 --> 41:32.123
(exhales)
It's how she was raised.

41:33.158 --> 41:35.326
(sighs)
I have to accept that.

41:35.493 --> 41:36.828
(grunts softly)

41:36.962 --> 41:40.131
Mrs. Tripp,
I'm... very sorry to press,

41:40.265 --> 41:41.667
but we don't have much time.

41:41.833 --> 41:44.002
Any information you can give us
that's more specific.

41:44.135 --> 41:45.671
Again, any gifts he gave her

41:45.804 --> 41:47.438
-or...
-President gave her a book.

41:47.573 --> 41:49.140
Okay, what book?

41:49.274 --> 41:50.609
And a hat pin.

41:50.742 --> 41:52.678
Although, of course, you've been
made aware of the hat pin.

41:52.811 --> 41:54.813
-Let's run the book
to the ground first.
-I don't know, some sort of a...

41:54.946 --> 41:57.515
autographed photo of-of him
in...

41:57.683 --> 41:59.517
-(chuckles softly)
one of her ties.
-I'm sorry,

41:59.685 --> 42:02.187
real quick, what was the title
of the book he gave her?

42:07.125 --> 42:08.560
His thoughtful gesture,

42:08.694 --> 42:11.496
as they met up
in our White House.

42:12.463 --> 42:15.033
That is a special place

42:15.200 --> 42:17.703
meant
for the most honorable few.

42:17.836 --> 42:19.370
There's a heaviness to that.

42:19.504 --> 42:22.674
Each, uh, handles it
his own way.

42:22.808 --> 42:25.210
Ronald Reagan became president

42:25.376 --> 42:27.713
and refused to set foot
in the Oval

42:27.879 --> 42:30.115
without a full suit and tie.

42:31.049 --> 42:33.752
George Bush became president
and handwrote letters

42:33.885 --> 42:37.222
to every family
who lost a son in action.

42:38.189 --> 42:40.225
Bill Clinton became president

42:40.358 --> 42:43.161
and got the first vulnerable
girl he saw in a hallway

42:43.294 --> 42:45.063
to suck his dick.

42:47.699 --> 42:49.167
And then, boy,

42:49.300 --> 42:51.402
did he make her suffer.

42:52.370 --> 42:53.839
(scoffs softly)

42:59.244 --> 43:01.747
The book was Leaves of Grass.

43:03.481 --> 43:05.917
See what he has to say
about that.

43:14.693 --> 43:17.062
* *

43:19.597 --> 43:21.432
(knocking)

43:23.935 --> 43:25.937
(indistinct singing on TV)

43:27.038 --> 43:27.906
Monica.

43:28.039 --> 43:29.440
Mom.
(panting)

43:29.574 --> 43:31.142
(crying)

43:31.276 --> 43:32.778
(exhales sharply)

43:35.046 --> 43:37.115
Ma'am, my name is Mike Emmick.

43:37.248 --> 43:39.284
I'm with the Office
of the Independent Counsel.

43:39.417 --> 43:41.386
I'd like to talk to my daughter
alone.

43:41.519 --> 43:42.754
And not in here.

43:42.888 --> 43:44.790
Yes, of course.

43:47.358 --> 43:49.394
(Monica breathing heavily)

43:54.933 --> 43:56.634
* *

44:10.048 --> 44:11.783
(beeps)

44:16.121 --> 44:18.857
(panting)

44:18.990 --> 44:20.658
-(sniffles) What have they done?
-(breathing heavily)

44:20.792 --> 44:22.293
-What did they do to you?
-(dialing)

44:22.427 --> 44:23.661
Wait, what are you doing?

44:23.829 --> 44:25.496
I'm calling Betty,
because they're gonna trap him.

44:25.630 --> 44:27.098
-No, Monica,
you're not calling anyone!
-How bad this is! No!

44:27.232 --> 44:28.233
-Please...
-You're not calling anyone.
Monica!

44:28.366 --> 44:29.835
-Please!
-You're not calling anyone.

44:29.968 --> 44:31.336
-We're gonna work something out
with them.
-(panting)

44:31.469 --> 44:33.171
No, you can't make me cooperate.

44:33.338 --> 44:35.340
-What are you talking about?
-Mom, I need your cell phone.

44:35.473 --> 44:36.708
-What? No.
-Please, Mom.

44:36.842 --> 44:38.376
-Please!
-No! Come here.

44:38.509 --> 44:40.011
Come here right now.

44:40.145 --> 44:41.980
All right, now listen to me,
sweetheart.

44:42.113 --> 44:43.782
This ends right now.

44:43.915 --> 44:45.784
This is all my fault.

44:45.917 --> 44:48.954
I caused this, and I'm
not gonna make him pay for that.

44:49.087 --> 44:51.022
It's his fault, too.
You need to start thinking

44:51.189 --> 44:52.490
about yourself right now.

44:52.623 --> 44:54.359
Mom,

44:54.525 --> 44:57.528
I'm not gonna be the one
to take down the president.

44:58.997 --> 45:00.732
Don't you see
that is what this is?

45:00.866 --> 45:03.701
I am not Bill Clinton's mother.

45:03.869 --> 45:05.470
I am your mother.

45:06.637 --> 45:08.706
(inhales, exhales)
Where are you going?

45:08.840 --> 45:11.042
(shudders)
I am going to talk with them.

45:11.176 --> 45:12.978
(sniffles, exhales)

45:17.348 --> 45:19.417
I would like to speak with you.

45:19.550 --> 45:21.086
And I need to use the restroom.

45:21.219 --> 45:23.288
And she needs to use
the restroom.

45:25.156 --> 45:27.725
LINDA:
You like salads though, right?

45:27.893 --> 45:29.928
And you can have a lot of salad
with this thing.

45:30.061 --> 45:33.098
MONICA:
Yeah, so we'll see. I mean, it's
good I get to eat pasta again.

45:33.231 --> 45:35.033
I love pasta.

45:35.166 --> 45:37.235
LINDA:
Do you like, um, Boston lettuce?

45:37.368 --> 45:39.104
MONICA:
I don't know Boston lettuce.

45:39.237 --> 45:40.772
LINDA:
It's very limp.

45:40.906 --> 45:42.908
MONICA:
Oh. Probably not. (chuckles)

45:43.041 --> 45:44.542
These two.
(exhales)

45:44.675 --> 45:47.879
I'm at once captivated and yet
now completely understand why,

45:48.013 --> 45:51.249
in some cultures,
they drown their female infants.

45:51.382 --> 45:53.919
-(snorts)
-These are shit.

45:54.920 --> 45:55.921
What?

45:56.087 --> 45:57.088
But she says--

45:57.222 --> 45:58.523
in horrifying detail--

45:58.656 --> 45:59.557
she gave him blow jobs.

45:59.690 --> 46:00.558
But she never says

46:00.691 --> 46:02.560
"Vernon Jordan got me a job

46:02.693 --> 46:03.929
in exchange for lying."

46:04.095 --> 46:05.130
She never says it.

46:05.263 --> 46:06.397
No quid pro quo.

46:06.531 --> 46:07.432
No smoking gun.

46:07.598 --> 46:09.200
But it is sex.

46:09.334 --> 46:11.069
"He shall be removed from office

46:11.202 --> 46:12.770
"on impeachment for

46:12.938 --> 46:14.873
"and conviction of treason,
bribery

46:15.006 --> 46:16.607
"or other high crimes

46:16.741 --> 46:18.243
-and misdemeanors."
-Yes, George,

46:18.376 --> 46:19.644
we heard you the first time.

46:19.777 --> 46:21.446
Having sex with an office girl

46:21.579 --> 46:24.115
is not a high crime
or misdemeanor.

46:24.249 --> 46:25.450
You've become a bore.

46:25.583 --> 46:27.452
-(scoffs)
-(doorbell rings)
-(knocking)

46:27.585 --> 46:29.587
(exhales)

46:31.589 --> 46:33.124
(sighs)

46:36.127 --> 46:37.628
Hey. Come in.

46:37.795 --> 46:41.299
(exhales)
The FBI has Monica Lewinsky.

46:41.466 --> 46:42.633
They're gonna flip her.

46:42.767 --> 46:44.002
They're gonna do it tonight.

46:44.135 --> 46:45.736
Fuck me.

46:56.381 --> 46:58.249
(grunts)

46:58.383 --> 46:59.317
(clears throat)

46:59.450 --> 47:01.152
I want you to understand,

47:01.286 --> 47:04.990
Monica has been through a lot
in her life.

47:05.156 --> 47:07.625
We get it. We've gotten
to know her a little bit today.

47:07.758 --> 47:08.826
She's a lovely young woman.

47:08.960 --> 47:10.195
Oh, yeah. Lovely.

47:10.328 --> 47:12.163
You must be very proud.

47:13.164 --> 47:14.499
(chuckles softly, inhales)

47:14.632 --> 47:16.301
Ma'am, we were asked
to wait for you, okay?

47:16.434 --> 47:18.669
You chose to take a train.
The train was delayed.

47:18.836 --> 47:20.505
I'm sorry I wasn't sitting ready

47:20.671 --> 47:23.508
for the FBI to descend
upon my daughter today.

47:23.641 --> 47:25.877
-Of course.
-Okay, fine. (chuckles) Fine.

47:26.011 --> 47:27.212
At any rate, we were assured,

47:27.345 --> 47:28.679
with you here,
she'd finally decide

47:28.813 --> 47:30.815
whether or not
she was willing to cooperate.

47:30.949 --> 47:33.518
Of course she will cooperate.

47:33.651 --> 47:35.887
She will answer
all of your questions.

47:36.021 --> 47:38.189
And you won't charge her
with anything.

47:39.257 --> 47:42.027
She will be given full immunity
from prosecution

47:42.193 --> 47:44.029
provided she answers
our questions

47:44.195 --> 47:46.631
and does monitored calls.

47:50.868 --> 47:52.837
(grunts)

47:54.205 --> 47:56.541
And, uh...

47:56.707 --> 47:58.843
-(inhales)
-(pouring)

47:58.977 --> 48:01.879
...if she says no to the calls?

48:02.047 --> 48:03.681
(pitcher clunks)

48:05.816 --> 48:07.685
Do we still get immunity?

48:07.818 --> 48:10.088
Well, the thing is
we need evidence

48:10.221 --> 48:11.322
that can be used in court.

48:11.456 --> 48:13.758
That's what the monitored calls
are for.

48:13.891 --> 48:15.393
Does that make sense?

48:15.526 --> 48:17.028
Mm-hmm.

48:18.997 --> 48:20.165
So it's a yes?

48:21.899 --> 48:23.368
Well...

48:23.501 --> 48:24.702
I'll try.

48:24.835 --> 48:26.437
I'll go explain to her...

48:26.571 --> 48:27.939
(inhales)

48:28.073 --> 48:30.475
...once you put it in writing.

48:31.509 --> 48:33.578
Okay, well, why don't you go,

48:33.711 --> 48:35.180
uh, have a word
with your daughter,

48:35.313 --> 48:36.847
uh, in the ladies' room

48:36.982 --> 48:39.951
and we will work on
that last part.

48:40.085 --> 48:42.153
* *

48:51.896 --> 48:53.731
-(door opens)
-(Bennett exhales)

48:55.566 --> 48:57.602
(quietly):
Starr will say yes to immunity.

48:57.735 --> 48:59.037
So what?

48:59.170 --> 49:00.605
We can't get it on paper.

49:00.738 --> 49:02.273
Not tonight.

49:04.942 --> 49:06.277
(exhales)

49:07.712 --> 49:08.846
(shudders)

49:08.980 --> 49:11.116
They can dial a phone
and put it in my hand.

49:11.249 --> 49:12.417
I won't do it.

49:14.119 --> 49:16.121
You're not being rational.

49:16.254 --> 49:17.855
I'll mess it up on purpose.

49:19.190 --> 49:20.725
(knocking)

49:20.858 --> 49:21.959
Yes?

49:24.595 --> 49:27.298
-Yes?
-Can we have a word, please?

49:27.465 --> 49:29.467
(sighs)

49:31.102 --> 49:32.637
You can have a seat.

49:32.803 --> 49:34.139
-(clears throat)
-Thank you.

49:34.272 --> 49:36.507
So, here's where we're at.

49:36.641 --> 49:37.742
We don't have a typewriter.

49:37.875 --> 49:39.644
Can't you send for one?

49:39.810 --> 49:40.678
-No.
-(groans)

49:40.811 --> 49:41.812
It's 11:00 p.m.

49:41.946 --> 49:43.148
There's no one at the office.

49:43.314 --> 49:46.084
-All right,
how about a computer?
-No.

49:46.217 --> 49:48.019
So you're saying there isn't
any way we can get this

49:48.153 --> 49:49.154
-in writing?
-BENNETT: Hey!

49:49.320 --> 49:50.321
Enough of this fucking bullshit!

49:50.488 --> 49:52.323
We've been waiting all day!

49:52.490 --> 49:54.492
EMMICK:
Now, listen, Monica will have

49:54.625 --> 49:57.162
full immunity from prosecution,
okay?

49:57.328 --> 50:00.831
You will have it in writing
first thing tomorrow morning.

50:03.234 --> 50:05.002
We need to make these calls
tonight.

50:05.136 --> 50:06.637
It is time-sensitive.

50:06.771 --> 50:09.174
So, ladies,
we've given you a promise.

50:09.307 --> 50:11.676
You need to give us an answer.

50:13.178 --> 50:15.180
All right. Well,
then I feel more comfortable

50:15.313 --> 50:17.215
if we call Monica's father
Dr. Lewinsky

50:17.348 --> 50:18.849
-to be a witness...
-No fucking way.
-No.

50:18.983 --> 50:19.950
...to this promise.

50:20.085 --> 50:22.487
-(groans)
-No. No one outside of this room

50:22.620 --> 50:24.021
can know what's happening.

50:24.155 --> 50:25.856
He already knows.
I've called him.

50:25.990 --> 50:28.025
-You told Dad?
-What? You told the father?!

50:28.193 --> 50:29.994
Yes.

50:32.530 --> 50:34.532
(phone ringing)

50:37.602 --> 50:38.469
Hello?

50:38.603 --> 50:39.637
Bernard Lewinsky?

50:39.770 --> 50:41.872
-Yes.
-I'm Mike Emmick with the office

50:42.006 --> 50:43.508
of Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr.

50:43.641 --> 50:44.975
I'm here with your daughter
and your wife.

50:45.110 --> 50:46.711
-Ex-wife.
-Ex-wife.

50:48.313 --> 50:50.381
Right. Sorry.

50:50.548 --> 50:54.385
Sir, we have evidence sufficient
to prosecute Monica

50:54.552 --> 50:55.920
for multiple felonies.

50:56.053 --> 50:57.555
We're offering her a chance

50:57.688 --> 50:59.924
to cooperate
with our office instead.

51:00.057 --> 51:01.058
Do you understand?

51:01.192 --> 51:03.094
Isn't she entitled
to an attorney?

51:03.228 --> 51:04.195
-An attorney?
-Yes.

51:04.329 --> 51:06.397
Yeah.
Does she have an attorney?

51:07.832 --> 51:09.200
Put Monica on the phone.

51:10.968 --> 51:12.837
He wants to talk to you.

51:20.678 --> 51:21.912
Hi, Daddy.

51:22.079 --> 51:23.581
Monka.

51:23.714 --> 51:26.016
I'm here with Bill Ginsburg.

51:26.151 --> 51:27.585
He's gonna be your attorney.

51:27.752 --> 51:29.854
Your friend Bill?

51:29.987 --> 51:31.756
-The malpractice lawyer?
-Yeah.

51:31.922 --> 51:34.091
I'm, uh...
I'm gonna hand you over.

51:35.059 --> 51:36.394
Do as he says, okay?

51:36.527 --> 51:37.762
Okay.

51:42.167 --> 51:44.435
Did they put you in bracelets,
sweetheart?

51:44.569 --> 51:46.437
Uh, what?

51:46.571 --> 51:48.539
-Are you in custody now, dear?
-Oh.

51:48.673 --> 51:50.107
Um...

51:51.041 --> 51:53.244
No, no.
Well, I don't think so.

51:53.378 --> 51:55.079
They just keep asking me to...
(shudders)

51:55.213 --> 51:56.281
to make a decision.

51:56.414 --> 51:57.748
All right,
put me through to them.

51:57.882 --> 51:59.250
Okay.

51:59.384 --> 52:00.785
He wants to talk to you.

52:04.054 --> 52:05.556
-Hello?
-Name, please.

52:05.690 --> 52:07.825
Who am I talking to?

52:07.958 --> 52:10.328
-Mike Emmick. Who is this?
-This is William Ginsburg.

52:10.461 --> 52:12.497
-I'm Monica's attorney.
-(mouths)

52:12.630 --> 52:13.964
(mouths)

52:14.098 --> 52:15.666
Mr. Ginsburg,

52:15.800 --> 52:18.102
we have been negotiating
with Ms. Lewinsky here

52:18.236 --> 52:19.937
-for 11 hours now...
-Negotiating? Really?

52:20.070 --> 52:23.441
Is that the new term of art
for "unlawful detention"?

52:23.574 --> 52:25.676
Sir, she could have left
at any time.

52:25.810 --> 52:29.146
Shut the fuck up,
you motherfucking cocksucker.

52:30.315 --> 52:32.250
-Excuse me?
-We've already heard

52:32.383 --> 52:33.484
what you want her to do.

52:33.618 --> 52:35.152
Now tell us
what she's gonna get for it.

52:35.286 --> 52:38.289
Full transactional immunity
from prosecution!

52:38.423 --> 52:40.791
-I want that in writing.
-Yeah, well,
it's nearly midnight here.

52:40.925 --> 52:42.760
-We've been down this road
with the mother.
-Too bad,

52:42.893 --> 52:44.362
so sad. Write it up.

52:44.495 --> 52:46.664
-Now.
-We don't have a typewriter
here.

52:46.831 --> 52:48.499
-Then write it out by hand
and fax it.
-No, we don't have

52:48.666 --> 52:51.336
-a fax machine either.
-You know, I know that hotel.

52:51.502 --> 52:53.271
I've stayed at that hotel.
They've got a fax machine.

52:53.404 --> 52:54.439
It's a goddamn

52:54.572 --> 52:55.606
Ritz-Carlton.

52:55.740 --> 52:58.309
Sir, we are
not going to use a communal fax.

52:58.443 --> 53:00.811
You are a lying sack of shit.

53:00.945 --> 53:03.381
Okay, look... I-I am sorry,
but I do not see

53:03.514 --> 53:05.550
the need to use profanity.

53:05.683 --> 53:06.951
That makes one of us.

53:07.084 --> 53:09.019
Because the plain fact
of the matter is

53:09.153 --> 53:11.556
you don't have the power
to put a single goddamn thing

53:11.689 --> 53:13.291
in writing now, do you?

53:13.424 --> 53:15.693
Fucking hang up on this prick.

53:15.860 --> 53:17.728
Mr. Ginsburg...
(exhales)

53:17.862 --> 53:19.464
this is a real offer.

53:19.597 --> 53:21.832
Tomorrow, we will fax it to you.

53:21.966 --> 53:23.501
You will have it in writing.

53:23.634 --> 53:24.702
So, for Monica's sake,

53:24.869 --> 53:26.671
for her future,

53:26.804 --> 53:27.838
believe me when I say
you do not want...

53:27.972 --> 53:28.839
Put my client back

53:28.973 --> 53:30.007
on the phone.

53:40.285 --> 53:41.552
What's going on?

53:41.686 --> 53:43.721
Sweetheart, I want you to listen
very carefully.

53:43.854 --> 53:45.222
Do exactly as I say.

53:45.356 --> 53:46.557
Stand up,

53:46.691 --> 53:47.858
don't say a word,

53:47.992 --> 53:50.395
walk out the door.

53:50.528 --> 53:51.896
What?

53:52.062 --> 53:54.399
They should never have held you
there, and they know it.

53:54.532 --> 53:56.401
Now go get your mother
and go home.

53:56.567 --> 53:57.402
Monica,

53:57.568 --> 53:58.903
nothing's gonna happen.

54:00.638 --> 54:03.040
(whispers): They said
they were gonna send me to jail.

54:03.173 --> 54:04.275
If they wanted to arrest you,

54:04.409 --> 54:05.443
they would have
done that already.

54:05.576 --> 54:06.877
I'm gonna hop on a red-eye.

54:07.011 --> 54:08.513
I'll see you in the morning.

54:08.646 --> 54:10.415
Now please go.

54:10.548 --> 54:12.182
I swear to you on my life,

54:12.317 --> 54:14.051
they cannot stop you.

54:15.420 --> 54:18.088
Monica, do you understand?

54:19.890 --> 54:21.258
Yes.

54:22.760 --> 54:24.462
(line clicks)

54:24.595 --> 54:25.930
(exhales)

54:26.096 --> 54:27.097
(sniffles)

54:29.934 --> 54:32.102
Mom, get your coat.
We're leaving.

54:34.605 --> 54:36.240
BENNETT:
There it is.

54:36.374 --> 54:37.775
Nice work.

54:42.580 --> 54:43.614
(door opens)

54:43.781 --> 54:45.282
So this is your final decision?

54:49.420 --> 54:50.755
Yes.

54:54.392 --> 54:56.461
Uh, thank you...

54:56.627 --> 54:59.797
uh, so much for everything.

55:01.466 --> 55:03.133
Good night, Monica.

55:03.267 --> 55:05.202
Good night.

55:08.606 --> 55:10.641

some tea.

-(cabinet door creaks)

56:04.194 --> 56:05.863
We could go to Canada.

56:07.432 --> 56:08.866
Tonight.

56:11.469 --> 56:13.838
We just get in the Jeep
and drive.

56:15.205 --> 56:17.842
Honey, they would
stop us at the border.

56:17.975 --> 56:19.677
They're the government.

56:19.810 --> 56:23.047
All you need to do now
is just get some sleep, and...

56:23.213 --> 56:25.149
-we will finish this tomorrow.
-I just...

56:25.282 --> 56:26.551
If I don't call Betty...

56:26.684 --> 56:28.052
No!

56:29.053 --> 56:30.087
You can't.

56:30.220 --> 56:32.557
You cannot!

56:32.723 --> 56:36.326
You have to look out
for your own life now, honey,

56:36.461 --> 56:38.463
your own future.

56:41.165 --> 56:43.167
(shuddering softly)

56:45.235 --> 56:47.237
I'm gonna take a shower.

56:48.739 --> 56:50.407
Okay.
All right.

56:50.575 --> 56:52.677
-I'm sorry.
-I don't want...

57:07.758 --> 57:09.760

I'm sorry.

1:00:05.936 --> 1:00:07.171
For what?

1:00:15.846 --> 1:00:17.114
My name's Archer.

1:00:17.247 --> 1:00:19.149
I'm an egomaniac
who endangers every mission.

1:00:19.283 --> 1:00:23.087
Also I'm inebriated
almost 24 hours a day.

NADJA: Dear Diary,
I have been reminiscing

1:00:33.597 --> 1:00:36.433
about the days I spent hanging
with those teen girls in Salem.

1:00:36.566 --> 1:00:38.969
Those bitches
were absolutely crazy!

1:00:39.103 --> 1:00:41.038
Really knew how to throw down.

1:00:41.638 --> 1:00:45.275
(squeaking)

1:00:47.244 --> 1:00:48.078
Brace yourselves.

1:00:48.578 --> 1:00:50.280
-Give me your best argument.
-Sure.

Pop culture is a religion.

1:00:52.082 --> 1:00:53.117
Fire. (laughs)

1:00:53.417 --> 1:00:54.251
You're in an era where

1:00:54.384 --> 1:00:55.419
we worship celebrities.

1:00:55.585 --> 1:00:57.654
-Oh, and also...
-Susie. Shh.

1:00:57.988 --> 1:01:00.290
I don't listen to people.
I listen to God.

1:01:00.424 --> 1:01:01.926
It's a constitutional guarantee.

1:01:02.960 --> 1:01:04.628

-Oh! I look terrible.

1:01:05.295 --> 1:01:07.131
I'm here to present the future.

1:01:07.264 --> 1:01:09.466
I posted that black square,
I deleted that black square.

1:01:09.599 --> 1:01:12.069

1:01:28.018 --> 1:01:29.586
People are gonna have
to pick sides.

1:01:30.921 --> 1:01:32.189
I think it's going
to get worse

1:01:32.322 --> 1:01:33.423
before it gets better.

1:01:34.491 --> 1:01:35.760
Run!

1:01:37.361 --> 1:01:40.130
I imagine that you attract
quite a bit of attention.

1:01:40.264 --> 1:01:41.665
Well, more than before.
That's for sure.
