There is a shadow war going
on between us and Ultra...

00:13.391 --> 00:15.891
- No!
-... the secret organization that hunts us.

00:15.893 --> 00:18.027
The only way to keep my
species from going extinct

00:18.029 --> 00:19.694
<i>is to find my father.</i>

00:19.696 --> 00:22.464
And the only way to do that
is by working for the enemy.

00:23.633 --> 00:25.734
<i>CARA: Previously on The Tomorrow People...</i>

00:25.736 --> 00:27.369
What are you going to do with me?

00:27.371 --> 00:29.305
Will you be so kind as to
give my daughter a sedative?

00:29.307 --> 00:32.206
No. No, get off me! I
don't need your drugs!

00:32.208 --> 00:34.409
It's okay, Cassie, it's
okay. Isn't that better?

00:34.411 --> 00:36.377
<i>STEPHEN: So you think they
were messing with her mind?</i>

00:36.979 --> 00:39.647
It was Ultra. She was strapped
to some sort of device.

00:39.649 --> 00:42.215
John, I wanted to talk
to you about your problems

00:42.217 --> 00:43.884
trying to get inside Jedikiah's head.

00:44.066 --> 00:46.900
<i>Maybe I can find out where
he's hiding Roger's body.</i>

00:46.902 --> 00:49.837
<i>JEDIKIAH: Here's what I figure
happened. Morgan ransacked my brain,</i>

00:49.839 --> 00:52.940
shared her discoveries with the
Tomorrow People, and now here you are.

00:52.942 --> 00:54.808
You said you cremated him.

00:54.810 --> 00:57.144
Yes, well it looks like we
both have some explaining to do.

01:05.318 --> 01:07.420
YOUNG ROGER: Hey, Jed.

01:07.422 --> 01:08.654
Jed, you okay?

01:10.424 --> 01:12.158
I heard what happened.

01:12.160 --> 01:14.560
- That guy's a total jerk.
- He's right!

01:15.595 --> 01:17.029
I'm weak.

01:19.332 --> 01:21.934
Hey, Jed. Jed, what
are you doing with that?

01:21.936 --> 01:23.702
It's Dad's.

01:23.704 --> 01:26.472
He doesn't know I found where he hides it.

01:26.474 --> 01:28.006
Why?

01:28.008 --> 01:29.340
I wanted to feel...

01:31.510 --> 01:33.545
powerful.

01:33.547 --> 01:35.246
Hey, hey. Don't be stupid.

01:35.248 --> 01:38.249
(SCOFFING) I thought I was the smart one.

01:38.251 --> 01:40.052
You're making fun of me now, too?

01:40.054 --> 01:41.587
Put it down.

01:57.136 --> 01:58.269
(STAMMERING) How did you?

02:00.372 --> 02:01.372
What?

02:02.674 --> 02:04.075
How did...

02:05.144 --> 02:08.179
Your father saved my life.

02:08.181 --> 02:11.983
- I owe him everything.
- So this is how you repay him?

02:11.985 --> 02:14.017
I loved your father.

02:14.019 --> 02:16.520
Every book I read, every class
I took, was for the purpose

02:16.522 --> 02:18.589
of understanding him and protecting him.

02:18.591 --> 02:21.258
He was more than my brother,
he was my life's work!

02:22.260 --> 02:24.027
Everything you see here

02:25.029 --> 02:26.563
is part of a plan.

02:26.565 --> 02:28.565
(SOFTLY) He never would have chosen this.

02:28.567 --> 02:30.434
He chose survival.

02:31.702 --> 02:34.037
I know you want him back, Stephen.

02:34.039 --> 02:35.506
So do I.

02:35.508 --> 02:37.307
Then why wouldn't you just
tell me this from the beginning?

02:37.309 --> 02:38.775
Because if you knew the plan,

02:38.777 --> 02:41.111
the Founder would have sniffed
it out like a shark after blood.

02:41.113 --> 02:44.448
- And if he knew that I was protecting Roger...
- Protecting him? Frozen?

02:44.450 --> 02:46.116
(SHOUTING) With a bullet through the chest?

02:46.118 --> 02:50.454
Nothing in comparison to what Bathory,
the Founder, had in store for him.

02:50.456 --> 02:54.691
He'd invented some kind of machine
to amplify your father's powers.

02:54.693 --> 02:56.159
Machine for what?

02:57.161 --> 02:59.428
I don't know.

02:59.430 --> 03:02.132
(QUIETLY) I don't know.

03:02.134 --> 03:05.035
Whatever it is, your father
risked death to stop it.

03:05.037 --> 03:08.237
He was always in danger of being
turned into a weapon by the Founder,

03:08.239 --> 03:12.175
or being destroyed by him, and the
second he comes back, so does the threat.

03:15.345 --> 03:18.447
You wouldn't have done all this
if you didn't have an endgame.

03:18.449 --> 03:21.117
A way of taking down the Founder.

03:21.119 --> 03:23.553
A way of bringing my father back.

03:24.955 --> 03:27.190
Oh, I always have a plan, Stephen.

What are you doing, wandering off
in the middle of the night, anyway?

04:03.159 --> 04:05.494
I keep sensing a breakout
near Lincoln Center.

04:05.496 --> 04:07.362
I wanted to see if Tim
was picking anything up.

04:07.364 --> 04:11.366
Now, usually, it's like... like they're
calling out to me, but this one...

04:12.635 --> 04:15.437
It feels like it's coming from inside me.

04:15.439 --> 04:18.172
- The only other time I felt that was...
- Stephen.

04:20.175 --> 04:22.009
It means something, John.

Mr. Bathory. Well, I haven't been
called that name in a long while.

04:38.394 --> 04:40.461
My apologies, a slip.

04:40.463 --> 04:43.264
No, no, it makes me think of the old days.

04:43.266 --> 04:45.432
And friends.

04:45.434 --> 04:48.736
But I'm not here to walk down
memory lane. We have business.

04:48.738 --> 04:52.239
- Actually, I'm in the middle of a breakout in...
- Oh, it can wait.

05:04.419 --> 05:05.586
So...

05:07.388 --> 05:11.957
The reconstruction of the machine your
brother destroyed is finally complete.

05:11.959 --> 05:13.326
It's time to move forward.

05:14.395 --> 05:15.928
(SCOFFING) How?

05:17.364 --> 05:20.500
We've been looking for a suitable
subject for over a decade.

05:20.502 --> 05:22.335
Oh, you know very well we've found him.

05:23.470 --> 05:25.672
Stephen? No, he's not ready.

05:25.674 --> 05:30.510
- Plus, entrusting the future of the planet to a teenager...
- You're stalling.

05:30.512 --> 05:33.946
Perhaps you've grown a
little too close to the boy.

05:36.549 --> 05:40.119
- He's my nephew.
- Mmm. And Cassie is my daughter.

05:40.121 --> 05:42.387
A synergist like Stephen.

05:42.389 --> 05:45.557
Stephen's mother is a paranormal?

05:45.559 --> 05:47.293
Oh, you didn't know?

05:47.295 --> 05:52.064
Oh, of course, that old
familiar blind spot for family.

05:52.066 --> 05:54.666
A luxury I cannot afford.

05:54.668 --> 05:57.269

Cassie would be up for the task,

You still haven't told me the
plan, how do we stop the Founder?

07:03.068 --> 07:04.201
We kill him.

07:05.904 --> 07:08.338
"We," meaning, "you."

07:08.340 --> 07:12.375
My species can't kill, you know that.

07:12.377 --> 07:13.720
You mean John.

07:13.721 --> 07:16.420
Stephen, can't you see that
this was part of the plan?

07:16.447 --> 07:19.048
The reason I engineered him to be lethal?

07:19.050 --> 07:22.118
- This is crazy.
- Perhaps.

07:22.120 --> 07:24.520
But it is the only way
to bring your father back.

you're asking me to do this.

brain to try to find another way.

08:11.155 --> 08:12.688
So keep thinking.

08:12.690 --> 08:15.557
Even if I could kill
the Founder, why would I?

08:15.559 --> 08:18.260
Because it's the only way to
bring my father back safely.

08:18.262 --> 08:20.762
So you want me to wash my hands
of his blood with someone else's?

08:20.764 --> 08:23.565
I don't want you to do any of this.

08:23.567 --> 08:25.400
Okay? It makes me sick
just thinking about it.

08:25.402 --> 08:27.736
But if the Founder's death
means my father's life?

08:27.738 --> 08:29.371
Says who?

08:29.373 --> 08:31.706
The same man who tricked
me into killing your dad?

08:32.875 --> 08:35.443
Stephen, listen.

08:35.445 --> 08:38.779
It wasn't long ago that I was
starting to think this was hopeless.

08:38.780 --> 08:40.715
That I was propping us up on...

08:40.717 --> 08:43.517
on a promise that I had
stopped believing in.

08:43.519 --> 08:45.072
But then you came along.

08:45.073 --> 08:47.384
And reminded me that
we can change the rules.

08:47.690 --> 08:49.858
There's always another way.

08:50.893 --> 08:52.426
We're never trapped.

08:54.596 --> 08:58.333
- If I have to do this alone, I will.
- How?

08:58.335 --> 09:01.336
Stephen, this isn't who we are.

09:01.338 --> 09:03.771
And it sure as hell isn't what
your dad would have wanted.

09:09.544 --> 09:11.712
(KNOCKING ON DOOR) (DOOR OPENING)

09:11.714 --> 09:13.614
Okay, how do we do this?

09:13.616 --> 09:15.582
Well, it's simple.

09:15.584 --> 09:18.185
And not so simple. You and
John are gonna have to find...

09:18.187 --> 09:21.889
No. No John. You want this done
so bad, you pull the trigger.

09:21.891 --> 09:27.594
Hmm. Well, a human being doesn't stand
a chance against the Founder, Stephen.

09:27.596 --> 09:31.464
So, I take it our gentle-hearted
friend turned down my proposal.

09:31.466 --> 09:33.433
I'll find a way to do this alone.

09:33.435 --> 09:36.436
Just tell me where the Founder is.

09:36.438 --> 09:39.672
This is a man who broke
out decades ago, Stephen.

09:39.674 --> 09:43.710
Hiding became a kind of survival
instinct for those early breakouts.

09:43.712 --> 09:46.446
Now he has more safe houses than the CIA,

09:46.448 --> 09:49.549
he trusts a very small group of
people, and, sadly, I'm not one of them.

09:49.551 --> 09:52.719
You're not giving me much to work
with here. There's gotta be some way.

09:52.721 --> 09:57.390
Yes. Provided you're willing
to adapt. So think, Stephen.

I not been protecting you, by the way.

- Focus, like a laser beam.

Not if I can't get to her.

10:16.710 --> 10:19.478

But an Ultra agent? Acting on my orders?

10:22.215 --> 10:24.516
You issue those orders,
the Founder will know.

10:24.518 --> 10:26.618
You'll be putting the
noose around your own neck.

10:26.620 --> 10:29.321
And you'll be standing
in the gallows with me.

All right, then tell me
why that's a good thing.

it to you a long time ago.

not tell you about until now.

deception from the very beginning.

us right to this exact point.

was part of the conspiracy.

in common with her than I do.

But first we have to get inside
and the only way past the perimeter

22:04.546 --> 22:07.846
is with a lock coded to his DNA.

- Meaning yours will unlock it?
- STEPHEN: No.

us. Not in your condition.

What happens once we're inside?

22:17.991 --> 22:19.424
Most likely...

<i>That's the real purpose? For now.</i>

24:09.934 --> 24:12.834
<i>But in time and with
the aid of others like us</i>

24:12.836 --> 24:15.937
<i>we will use these powers
to change the world.</i>

24:15.939 --> 24:17.706
(INHALING)

24:17.708 --> 24:20.108
Okay, wow.

24:20.110 --> 24:24.379
You guys gonna give me any of the
details on this conversation or...

24:26.115 --> 24:29.551
Well, uh... first we eat. I'm famished.

24:33.906 --> 24:36.074
SOPHIE: Oh, my God.

24:36.076 --> 24:38.410
How long were you stuck underground?

24:38.412 --> 24:41.813
For a lot longer than I
wanted to be. It was rough.

24:41.815 --> 24:43.581
I would have totally lost it.

24:43.583 --> 24:47.051
Yeah, there's not a lot of
space to dance down there, huh?

24:47.053 --> 24:49.353
Dance is my life.

24:49.355 --> 24:51.856
Or... was.

24:51.858 --> 24:55.760
Till my sister stepped out of whatever
comic book she's been living in to ruin it.

24:55.762 --> 24:57.595
You know, they didn't choose this.

25:00.065 --> 25:03.601
I was so proud of her when we were young.

25:03.603 --> 25:06.737
Growing up deaf. Cut off from the world.

25:08.373 --> 25:10.675
- She was so brave.
- She still is.

25:11.877 --> 25:13.878
Fine.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.780
But why do I have to live her life?

25:15.782 --> 25:18.716
I don't know. You're chosen.

25:18.718 --> 25:23.053
What about my choice? Doesn't
that count for anything?

25:23.055 --> 25:24.822
How did you like having that taken away?

25:26.691 --> 25:28.025
Exactly.

25:29.760 --> 25:30.894
(SIGHING)

25:34.465 --> 25:37.567
- Russell, wake up, buddy.
- Is it zero dark thirty?

25:37.569 --> 25:38.768
Five more minutes.

25:38.770 --> 25:41.839
We don't have five minutes.
Get up now, Russell.

25:41.841 --> 25:44.908
(GASPING) Dude, what the...

25:44.910 --> 25:46.810
Who let him in the lair?

25:46.812 --> 25:49.947
Russell, listen to me, we need him.

25:49.949 --> 25:53.516
He is the only one who can hack
into the Ultra mainframe using Tim.

25:53.518 --> 25:57.519
To get us in and out of the
Founder's compound undetected.

25:57.521 --> 25:59.455
Okay?

25:59.457 --> 26:02.091
And, obviously, I can't
leave him down here alone.

26:08.365 --> 26:10.666
(STUTTERING) No tricks, Russell.

26:11.835 --> 26:12.935
You have my word.

26:16.773 --> 26:18.507
Ready for this?

26:18.509 --> 26:19.808
Are you?

26:19.810 --> 26:22.611
Well, seeing as this is
my first suicide mission...

26:22.613 --> 26:23.980
No. No.

26:25.515 --> 26:28.784
Get ready fast. The thing
about a suicide mission is...

26:28.786 --> 26:30.853
You only get one shot.

26:30.855 --> 26:33.722
You got your sister all squared
away? Said your goodbyes?

26:33.724 --> 26:36.759
She's at your house, actually.
Astrid's looking after her.

26:36.761 --> 26:39.428
<i>TIM: Actually, recent cell
phone activity indicates</i>

26:39.430 --> 26:41.764
<i>that Astrid and your sister are
currently at the Lincoln Center.</i>

26:41.766 --> 26:43.732
CARA: Wait, what?

26:43.734 --> 26:46.468
<i>- TIM: It's opening night of Giselle. One of my favorites.
- Oh, my God!</i>

26:46.470 --> 26:48.771
Go. Do what you gotta do.

26:48.773 --> 26:51.507
- What about the mission? The Founder?
- Family first.

26:51.509 --> 26:53.375
Besides, we got this.

26:53.377 --> 26:55.076
Sure. No sweat.

27:07.990 --> 27:09.324
Cara.

27:09.326 --> 27:11.927
Yeah, I know.

27:11.929 --> 27:13.694
(SIGHING)

27:13.696 --> 27:15.730
This won't be the last time I see you.

27:17.400 --> 27:18.733
But in case it is...

27:51.946 --> 27:54.348
(SIGHING) Look, I know you're mad.

27:54.350 --> 27:56.617
I'm not mad, but we need to go.

27:56.619 --> 27:59.186
- Just let me stay.
- I can't.

27:59.188 --> 28:01.321
I need to protect you,
I cannot lose you again...

28:01.323 --> 28:03.323
Can't you protect me here?

28:03.325 --> 28:06.827
- My friends need me.
- I need you.

28:06.829 --> 28:11.631
Just let me do this one last thing as a
human being and I'll come with you. Please.

28:11.633 --> 28:13.166
(MUSIC CRESCENDOS)

28:18.606 --> 28:21.775
So, what happens now, uh, in the story?

28:21.777 --> 28:27.180
I rise from the grave and join the other
virgins who died of unrequited love.

28:27.182 --> 28:29.649
- So, it's a comedy?
- (LAUGHING)

28:31.920 --> 28:33.186
Just watch.

28:33.188 --> 28:34.788
(INHALING) I'm gonna kill it.

28:48.435 --> 28:53.105
Okay, this is the last firewall
before we are in Ultra's mainframe.

28:53.107 --> 28:56.042
JEDIKIAH: And Tim, if I
catch you accessing this,

28:56.044 --> 28:57.910
you're gonna wish you were
never programmed, you got it?

28:57.912 --> 28:59.378
<i>TIM: Of course, Dr. Price.</i>

28:59.380 --> 29:02.681
- All right, deactivate protocol 77, please.
- Whoa!

29:02.683 --> 29:08.687
No mysterious protocols. Tim,
de-deactivate protocol 77.

29:10.157 --> 29:11.958
What do I hit?

29:11.960 --> 29:15.094
<i>TIM: Protocol 77 transmits the
compound's security status to Ultra.</i>

29:15.096 --> 29:18.296
And any agent with a pulse will
be swarming them within seconds.

29:21.867 --> 29:23.601
Tim...

29:23.603 --> 29:26.838
Re-deactivate protocol 7...

29:26.840 --> 29:29.274
Whatever, just kill the
damn alarm, would you?

29:29.276 --> 29:32.043
<i>- Smart move.

Sir, we have a breach. Someone
just accessed the main gate.

29:48.695 --> 29:50.194
They're already inside.

One of my own kind, if I'm not mistaken.

- Stand down.

It's only my daughter.

She's taking too long. Stephen.

30:24.630 --> 30:25.629

She'll do it.

30:37.976 --> 30:40.710
Oh, you're sick, darling.

30:40.712 --> 30:42.746
You should be in the hospital.

30:44.349 --> 30:46.349

Well, you know, I'm... I'm sure that
they were just trying to help you.

30:50.021 --> 30:55.024
We both know that you have
a powerful imagination.

30:55.026 --> 30:57.260
I can still see their faces.

30:57.262 --> 30:59.828
And the needles. And that chair.

Oh, you poor thing.

31:02.433 --> 31:05.201
How did you manage to get out?

31:05.203 --> 31:07.236
I must have teleported out.

31:07.238 --> 31:09.705
(CHUCKLING) In your condition? No.

Perhaps you were helped?

31:15.845 --> 31:18.214
Somehow?

Can't you see what he's doing?

32:57.780 --> 32:59.079

Down.

33:04.752 --> 33:05.886
Okay.

33:07.788 --> 33:11.423
All that Jedikiah's told you about me

33:11.425 --> 33:15.127
and about the machine, it's
to drive a wedge between us.

33:15.129 --> 33:17.096
Just like he did with your father and me.

33:17.098 --> 33:20.666
To make himself into a martyr
when your uncle is a monster.

33:20.668 --> 33:22.868
You experimented on your own daughter.

33:26.807 --> 33:30.843
I hoped that Cassie would be
able to activate the machine, yes.

33:30.845 --> 33:33.746
And I made sacrifices that no
father should ever have to make.

33:33.748 --> 33:36.347
But the machine was your
father's dream, Stephen.

33:36.349 --> 33:39.851
A device that could finally
build a road to our salvation.

33:39.853 --> 33:43.188
Why else would I risk my own child?

33:43.190 --> 33:44.889
I did it for you.

33:44.891 --> 33:47.025
I did it for your father,
I did it for all of us!

33:47.027 --> 33:48.359
What are you waiting for?

33:48.361 --> 33:51.295
Jedikiah has always
been fuelled by jealousy.

33:51.297 --> 33:54.799
He formed Ultra to acquire your
father's abilities for himself.

33:54.801 --> 33:56.634
And now, he's using you!

33:56.636 --> 33:59.303
You're lying. You're lying.

33:59.305 --> 34:00.304
(EXHALING)

34:16.054 --> 34:17.288
I'm on your side.

34:23.194 --> 34:24.295
Stephen.

34:27.799 --> 34:31.068
Just like the weakling he is,
Jedikiah poisoned Roger's mind.

34:31.070 --> 34:35.038
He tricked him into destroying the
machine. Think about it, Stephen!

34:35.040 --> 34:37.141
Who ordered your father's death?

34:37.143 --> 34:39.342
Who forced the gun into your hand? Him.

34:39.344 --> 34:42.344
Him, and his bitterness and lies.

34:42.347 --> 34:46.181
But now, we have a chance.

34:46.184 --> 34:48.885
We can end this, together!

We can complete your father's work.

We only got one shot here, Stephen.

This is because of him.
Your uncle did this!

You have an enemy.

35:40.068 --> 35:42.303
But it is not me.

All I ever wanted was
to stop the bloodshed.

No matter how many times I perform it,

36:11.904 --> 36:14.671

You were beautiful.

Are you sure you weren't using your

The Founder couldn't have...

He didn't.

John.

37:04.187 --> 37:05.587
Russell, where's Jedikiah?

37:05.589 --> 37:07.756
What?

37:07.758 --> 37:10.459
After Mission Impossible went off the rails

37:10.461 --> 37:13.529
he cracked me on the head with a gun
and forced me to bring him topside.

JOHN: (YELLING) Damn it, Russell!

37:15.166 --> 37:16.898

Wait, wait, wait.

37:29.178 --> 37:30.745
We don't know who we can trust.

But if you set foot in
Ultra, you're a dead man.

37:33.917 --> 37:36.484
We need answers, and I will get them.

37:39.555 --> 37:42.456
You have one hour. Then I'm coming for him.

37:42.458 --> 37:43.457
Yeah.

37:47.930 --> 37:50.131
Come on, let's get you out of here.

37:57.907 --> 38:00.741
CARA: I'm sorry that you had to see that.

38:00.743 --> 38:03.643
Is it always like this in your world?

38:03.645 --> 38:05.746
I can't believe I have to
give up my entire life for...

38:07.782 --> 38:09.382
I didn't mean...

38:12.486 --> 38:14.788
I just feel like I'm losing everything.

38:18.459 --> 38:20.260
Maybe you don't have to.

38:23.297 --> 38:24.397
Here.

38:26.434 --> 38:29.169
Stephen will wipe you
from Ultra's mainframe.

38:29.171 --> 38:30.738
And that will suppress your powers.

38:30.740 --> 38:34.341
But you have to promise
to wear it at all times.

38:34.343 --> 38:36.309
Thank you so much, Cara.

38:36.311 --> 38:37.510
You're saving my life.

38:39.213 --> 38:40.547
Or the opposite.

38:43.351 --> 38:45.585
- Be careful.
- You're going?

38:46.687 --> 38:47.854
Can I see you again?

38:49.290 --> 38:50.357
Do you want to?

38:52.192 --> 38:54.261
Of course.

38:54.263 --> 38:55.428
You're my sister.

39:00.401 --> 39:02.034
<i>JEDIKIAH: It's not fair.</i>

39:02.036 --> 39:05.272
I don't choose who has abilities,
Jedikiah, and neither do you.

39:05.274 --> 39:08.241
I'm sorry, but we have
to address this inequity.

39:08.243 --> 39:10.009
Otherwise, when it goes public...

39:10.011 --> 39:12.879
(STUTTERING) The backlash against
paranormals could be catastrophic.

39:12.881 --> 39:16.548
Hmm, can we at least call this
"inequity" for what it is, "jealousy."

39:16.550 --> 39:18.317
You will never be your brother.

39:22.156 --> 39:23.890
Either you direct a portion

39:23.892 --> 39:26.458
of this research towards
transferring powers to Homo sapiens...

39:26.460 --> 39:28.394
Saps.

39:28.396 --> 39:30.830
Oh, it's just a little term I came up with.

39:32.432 --> 39:34.533
Or we sever ties.

39:35.702 --> 39:37.535
We do?

39:37.537 --> 39:39.838
That's right.

39:39.840 --> 39:42.674
Roger's loyal to me, he'll do what I ask.

39:42.676 --> 39:46.344
So, it's you two versus
me on the paranormal front?

39:48.147 --> 39:50.182
Rivalries can get ugly, Jedikiah.

39:50.184 --> 39:51.649
Then don't start one.

39:53.853 --> 39:56.621
Well, if you insist. All
for one and one for all.

40:12.338 --> 40:14.305
You're running?

40:14.307 --> 40:16.407
After Cassie died for us, for your plan?

40:18.544 --> 40:21.713
- You told me you'd bring my dad back.
- You failed him, Stephen.

40:21.715 --> 40:23.648
Just like you failed Cassie.

40:23.650 --> 40:26.351
- Now, the Founder...
- The Founder said that your jealousy

40:26.353 --> 40:27.852
destroyed our family.

40:27.854 --> 40:28.919
(SIGHING)

40:30.522 --> 40:33.290
What do you really want with my father?

40:33.292 --> 40:36.493
I told you before, I loved Roger.

40:36.495 --> 40:38.428
You know all this?

40:38.430 --> 40:39.796
Hunting my kind?

40:40.865 --> 40:43.233
Killing my father.

40:45.370 --> 40:48.405
Just tell me it's not about you
wanting his powers for yourself.

40:50.475 --> 40:53.777
It wasn't Roger's powers that
saved me that day, Stephen.

40:58.416 --> 40:59.916
It was his love for me.

41:01.552 --> 41:03.186
His humanity saved me.

41:08.492 --> 41:10.259
What am I supposed to do?

41:15.565 --> 41:18.634
You need to decide who you really are.

41:18.636 --> 41:20.770
Your powers make you very strong.

41:23.139 --> 41:26.375
But only your humanity can save us.

41:26.377 --> 41:27.810
Every one of us.

41:40.123 --> 41:41.456
Where is he?
