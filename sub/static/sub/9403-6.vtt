- <i>What? You got a problem?</i> 
<i>- Yeah. I do.</i>

00:07.370 --> 00:10.540
You have what's called
a dissociative fugue disorder.

00:10.541 --> 00:12.774
You temporarily become
someone else.

00:13.084 --> 00:15.059
- Why is there a kid here?
- That's Logan.

00:15.060 --> 00:18.131
- He lost his parents.
<i>- Bye, Lydia.</i>

00:18.132 --> 00:21.966
Okay, it looks Nathan Scott
<i>was</i> on flight 2326 last night.

00:26.556 --> 00:27.724
You said you lost
everything in the fire,

00:27.725 --> 00:29.101
so why do you have this?

00:29.102 --> 00:31.075
What else are you
lying about, Dan?

00:31.076 --> 00:32.192
Where is Nathan?

00:32.194 --> 00:33.814
What did you do to him?

00:33.815 --> 00:35.816
- 911.
- What's your emergency?

00:35.817 --> 00:38.527
I need your help.
There's a murderer in my house.

Millie, what else
is happening locally?

00:52.882 --> 00:53.917
Let's see.

00:53.918 --> 00:57.185
Well, Allegedly,

00:57.186 --> 01:00.021
Tree Hill café
was vandalized last night,

01:00.022 --> 01:01.341

Brooke Davis.

Tree Hill café owner
Tara Richards

01:06.111 --> 01:07.562

01:07.563 --> 01:09.731
but would simply like
everybody to know

01:09.732 --> 01:11.599
that Brooke Davis did it.

01:11.600 --> 01:13.351
Allegedly.

01:17.190 --> 01:19.693
Okay, not allegedly.
Witnesses confirmed it.

01:19.694 --> 01:22.577
<i>Of course, not all witnesses
are reliable.</i>

01:22.578 --> 01:23.962

you're a dead man.

10:46.677 --> 10:49.277
Over a basketball player?
That's insane!

10:49.278 --> 10:51.345
No, no.

10:51.346 --> 10:52.847
Insane is crossing a man

10:52.848 --> 10:54.849
who pays his players cash

10:54.850 --> 10:57.368
from a suitcase
chained to his wrist.

10:57.369 --> 11:01.232
You take his best player,
you take his money.

11:01.233 --> 11:04.876
You take his money,
we take your life.

11:22.043 --> 11:23.878
Um...

11:23.879 --> 11:26.097
Is there a zombie apocalypse
or something going on

11:26.098 --> 11:27.508
that I don't know about?

11:27.509 --> 11:30.261
It's been dead all morning...
pun intended.

11:30.262 --> 11:33.654
Is this because I trashed
that whorehouse next door?

11:33.655 --> 11:36.240
The town should give me
a medal for that.

11:36.241 --> 11:37.892
I'd settle for some tips.

11:37.893 --> 11:38.943
Brooke...

11:39.228 --> 11:40.980
Did you see me
on the news?

11:40.981 --> 11:43.397
I guess people are more afraid
of the crazy manager

11:43.398 --> 11:44.567
than the murderous chef.

11:44.568 --> 11:46.334
Crazy?

11:46.335 --> 11:47.835
<i>I'm</i> crazy?

11:47.836 --> 11:50.588
I'm not the one
who put that horrific note

11:50.589 --> 11:52.033
on my husband's car.

11:52.034 --> 11:55.453
Yeah, and I'm not the one
that left a baby in it.

11:55.454 --> 11:58.790
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a packed café to run.

11:58.791 --> 12:00.875
This is <i>not</i> over.

12:00.876 --> 12:04.295
Looks over to me.

12:06.674 --> 12:10.274
"I need you
at the house asap.

12:10.275 --> 12:11.776
Haley."

12:11.777 --> 12:14.094
How am I
gonna explain this one?

12:18.936 --> 12:20.061
No.

12:20.062 --> 12:22.059
Wait, wait, wait. Don't be afraid.
I just want to talk.

12:22.060 --> 12:23.356
I'm not upset with you
for calling the police.

12:23.357 --> 12:24.605
I don't care, Dan.

12:24.606 --> 12:26.818
I just want to look
for Nathan together.

12:26.819 --> 12:28.111
He's my son.

12:28.112 --> 12:29.660
I love him.
I love Jamie.

12:29.661 --> 12:30.912
I love <i>you.</i>

12:30.913 --> 12:32.657
I would <i>never
hurt my family.</i>

12:32.658 --> 12:34.867
It's <i>my</i> family,
and you <i>have.</i>

12:34.868 --> 12:37.161
I had nothing to do with it.
You have to believe me.

12:37.162 --> 12:38.452
I <i>don't</i> believe you, Dan,

12:38.453 --> 12:39.637
because if
it wasn't you directly,

12:39.638 --> 12:40.665
it was because of something
you've done.

12:40.666 --> 12:42.590
What did you do
to my dad?!

12:44.293 --> 12:46.671
Jamie,
it's not like that.

12:46.672 --> 12:48.679
No. You're a liar!
Just bring him back!

12:52.759 --> 12:55.012
So, what now?

12:55.013 --> 12:57.181
You want me to tell my son
that you're not a monster?

12:59.074 --> 13:00.768
I'm sorry.
Yeah, you are.

13:00.769 --> 13:02.777
I want you to stay away
from my house

13:02.778 --> 13:04.245
and stay out
of our lives!

13:19.333 --> 13:20.705
Julian Baker.

13:20.706 --> 13:22.836
You're looking at him.

13:22.837 --> 13:25.421
I'll take your word
for it.

13:27.457 --> 13:30.089
What happened to your face?
Your wife beat you up?

13:31.508 --> 13:32.633
That Brooke's
a feisty one, huh?

13:32.634 --> 13:35.553
Dan Scott.
What do you want?

13:35.554 --> 13:37.117
Right to the point.
Good.

13:37.118 --> 13:38.418
I need a work space.

13:38.419 --> 13:40.019
I'll give you 3 grand
a month

13:40.020 --> 13:42.143
to get rid of the rest
of your clients.

13:42.144 --> 13:45.021
I don't have
any other clients.

13:45.022 --> 13:46.814
Like I said, I'll give you
2 grand a month.

13:46.815 --> 13:49.025
I'll need a trailer
and complete privacy.

13:49.026 --> 13:51.319
To do what?

13:51.320 --> 13:53.905
Let's make it
3 grand a month

13:53.906 --> 13:55.740
and you don't ask
that question again.

13:55.741 --> 13:57.854
It's nothing illegal.

13:57.855 --> 13:59.202
Deal?

13:59.203 --> 14:05.545
♪ Last time I saw him,
he had holes in his shoes ♪

14:05.546 --> 14:07.514
I'll show you
the trailers.

14:12.553 --> 14:17.640
♪ But it was too much,
too little ♪

14:17.641 --> 14:19.008
♪ too late
hey.

14:19.009 --> 14:21.510
I know why you're upset,
and I'm really sorry.

14:21.511 --> 14:23.601
It's just Tara left this note
on Julian's car,

14:24.101 --> 14:25.348
and I totally
flipped out!

14:25.349 --> 14:26.270
Nathan's missing.

14:26.271 --> 14:27.688
What do you mean
he's missing?

14:27.689 --> 14:32.193
His flight landed,
and he never came home.

14:32.194 --> 14:35.542
- Oh, my God, hales. I'm so sorry.
- No.

14:35.543 --> 14:37.710
I've been running around
all day.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.617
I... I'm here now.
What can I do?

14:39.618 --> 14:41.047
Can you watch the café?
Can you...

14:41.048 --> 14:42.916
just so I know
that it's in good hands

14:42.917 --> 14:44.580
and I don't have to
think about it.

14:44.581 --> 14:45.998
Yeah. Of course.
Anything.

14:45.999 --> 14:47.667
Okay.

14:47.668 --> 14:50.539
We've been through a lot,
you and I.

14:50.540 --> 14:52.175
We'll get through this.

14:52.504 --> 14:54.427
Yeah.

15:02.264 --> 15:03.820
Thank you.

15:07.491 --> 15:09.409
What are you doing?

15:09.410 --> 15:12.066
I'm just
hoping Tara sees me here.

15:12.067 --> 15:13.609
Pisses her off.

15:13.610 --> 15:16.445
And you like that
because...?

15:16.446 --> 15:18.918
I don't know.
She likes the drama.

15:18.919 --> 15:20.236
We call it foreplay.

15:22.117 --> 15:26.038
So, I can tell you were pissed
that I stood up kid Keller.

15:26.039 --> 15:27.707
It's fine.

15:27.708 --> 15:29.166
Nah, it's not.

15:29.167 --> 15:30.293
You're right.
It's not.

15:30.294 --> 15:31.627
But if it makes you
feel any better,

15:31.628 --> 15:33.516
his dad
eventually showed up.

15:33.517 --> 15:34.630
You checked on him?

15:34.631 --> 15:36.215
That's pretty cool, dude.

15:36.216 --> 15:39.472
In fact, Chris Keller's
decided you're a good dude.

15:39.473 --> 15:41.137
Is that a good thing?

15:41.138 --> 15:44.294
Hey, Chris Keller doesn't hand
out those titles lightly.

15:45.807 --> 15:48.102
Truth is,
I don't have a lot of friends.

15:48.103 --> 15:50.566
Anyway, I just...

15:50.567 --> 15:52.035
I just wanted
to say I'm sorry

15:52.036 --> 15:53.936
for playing a part in Alex
taking that tour.

15:53.937 --> 15:55.371
I know it's been hard
to deal with.

15:57.110 --> 15:58.821
Chris Keller's here
for you.

15:58.822 --> 16:00.493
Wow.

16:00.494 --> 16:03.701
Well, uh,
I appreciate that.

16:03.702 --> 16:05.114
All right.

16:05.115 --> 16:08.372
We just got to find you a girl
like Tara now.

16:15.509 --> 16:17.393
Logan asked me
why I'm here.

16:17.672 --> 16:18.633
What did you say?

16:18.634 --> 16:21.431
I did not know
what <i>to</i> say.

16:21.432 --> 16:23.930
Well, it's not an easy thing
to explain.

16:23.931 --> 16:26.969
The amount of trauma
that you've experienced

16:26.970 --> 16:29.060
in your life
is, uh, significant.

16:29.061 --> 16:30.657
A lot of people
go through crap,

16:30.658 --> 16:32.229
but they don't wake up
on merry-go-rounds.

16:32.230 --> 16:34.861
A lot of people don't watch
their wife die in front of them

16:34.862 --> 16:36.329
and then get shot
point blank

16:36.330 --> 16:37.860
by a woman
who looks like her, either.

16:37.861 --> 16:40.533
It's still just trauma.

16:43.287 --> 16:45.618
You've been through a lot,
Clay.

16:45.619 --> 16:47.995
And I think maybe
it's hard for you to admit

16:48.375 --> 16:50.843
that you need more help
than most people.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.833
You think somehow
it diminishes you.

16:52.834 --> 16:54.502
It doesn't.

16:54.503 --> 16:57.833
♪ But if we lose
all direction ♪

16:57.834 --> 17:00.269
It's hard to think about it...
Nathan.

17:00.270 --> 17:01.670
I know.

17:01.671 --> 17:03.022
When I left Haley,

17:03.023 --> 17:04.970
she was just about to meet
with the detectives.

17:04.971 --> 17:07.727
I thought that I had it bad,
you know,

17:07.728 --> 17:10.179
with Julian literally
beating himself up

17:10.180 --> 17:11.680
over this Davis thing.

17:11.681 --> 17:14.271
I can't imagine what this is
like for Haley.

17:14.271 --> 17:15.940
How is she holding up?

17:15.941 --> 17:17.286
She's a wreck.

17:17.287 --> 17:18.871
Plus she asked me
to watch the café,

17:18.872 --> 17:20.740
and I don't know
how to tell her

17:20.741 --> 17:22.492
that when she
comes back here,

17:22.492 --> 17:25.074
there isn't gonna be a café
because of that bitch Tara!

17:25.075 --> 17:28.703
God, it feels good to swear
without my kids here.

17:28.704 --> 17:29.954
Well, I'm here to help.

17:29.955 --> 17:31.700
You better be,

17:31.701 --> 17:34.554
especially after your little
pro-Tara report this morning.

17:34.555 --> 17:36.506
I was just reading the news
I was given.

17:36.507 --> 17:37.650
Mm-hmm.

17:37.651 --> 17:39.759
But, to make up for it,

17:39.760 --> 17:42.550
I have
a very pro-Brooke idea.

17:42.551 --> 17:43.634
I'm listening.

17:43.635 --> 17:46.232
What if you organize
some live music here

17:46.233 --> 17:47.567
like back in the day?

17:47.568 --> 17:50.219
You could ask one of
our current patrons...

17:50.220 --> 17:52.810
<i>not</i> chase.

17:52.811 --> 17:54.228
How's that for help?

17:54.229 --> 17:55.742
Pretty good.

17:55.743 --> 17:57.326
I'm gonna need you to pick
the twins up in an hour.

18:01.818 --> 18:03.332
Ugh.

18:11.011 --> 18:13.414
What you got there,
little man?

18:13.415 --> 18:16.584
Some videos dad sent me
from Europe.

18:16.585 --> 18:18.217
<i>It doesn't matter how far
I go, Jamie Scott,</i>

18:18.218 --> 18:20.586
- <i>you're always with me.</i>
- When I play this,

18:20.587 --> 18:23.706
it feels like he's right here
talking to me.

18:23.707 --> 18:26.469
But what if it's the last time
I see him?

18:26.470 --> 18:28.811
It's not going to be.
Okay?

18:28.812 --> 18:32.699
Think of all the things
your dad's come back from...

18:32.700 --> 18:36.437
the car crash, his back,
your crazy nanny.

18:36.704 --> 18:38.705
Our crazy nanny
who kidnapped me.

18:38.706 --> 18:40.689
Exactly.
But here you are.

18:40.690 --> 18:42.193
'Cause you're a Scott,

18:42.194 --> 18:45.745
and no one is tougher or smarter
than a Scott.

18:51.752 --> 18:54.622
I love this game.

18:54.623 --> 18:57.340
How did you...
where did you come by this?

18:57.341 --> 19:01.210
A local friend.
He calls them "bones."

19:02.714 --> 19:05.181
Like <i>he'll</i> be...
bones.

19:06.259 --> 19:08.135
Hey, what are you waiting for,
anyway?

19:08.136 --> 19:11.237
Huh? You got me here.
What are you waiting for?

19:11.238 --> 19:15.158
"How poor are they
that they have no patience?"

19:16.660 --> 19:19.105
They tell us to wait,
we wait.

19:19.106 --> 19:20.896
Well, who's <i>they?</i>

19:20.897 --> 19:23.692
Hey

19:23.693 --> 19:26.570
You know I have a wife
and two kids, right?

19:26.571 --> 19:28.697
I have <i>two</i> wives.

19:28.698 --> 19:31.574
And <i>six</i> kids.

19:34.411 --> 19:36.539
I also used to play
in the NBA.

19:36.540 --> 19:39.632
I can pay you
a lot of money.

19:42.719 --> 19:45.104
It's not about money.

19:45.105 --> 19:46.507
Right.

19:46.774 --> 19:48.391
It's about killing me
over a basketball player.

19:48.392 --> 19:49.442
That makes sense.

19:49.718 --> 19:51.644
We entered into contract.

19:51.645 --> 19:54.431
You, as agent,
should understand it.

19:54.432 --> 19:56.532
Have you ever heard
of a holdout?

19:56.533 --> 19:58.435
Two wives?
Six kids?

19:58.436 --> 20:00.987
I'd milk every penny
I could get.

20:00.988 --> 20:03.274
What are you... ohh!

20:03.275 --> 20:05.825
No talking!

20:17.621 --> 20:22.626
Have you not heard
of honor among thieves?

20:22.627 --> 20:26.729
We gave our word, Nathan Scott,
that you would die.

20:29.215 --> 20:30.593
And so you will.

20:49.737 --> 20:51.864
Knock, knock.
You got a sec?

20:51.865 --> 20:55.092
Mouth.
What's up, man? Hey.

20:55.093 --> 20:56.510
I'd offer you a drink,

20:56.511 --> 20:59.038
but juice time is not
for another half-hour.

20:59.039 --> 21:00.681
I'm good.

21:00.682 --> 21:02.374
I just... I wanted to come by
and say I'm really sorry.

21:02.375 --> 21:03.784
Well, thanks.

21:03.785 --> 21:07.254
But hopefully I'll be flying
this cuckoo's nest soon.

21:07.255 --> 21:10.090
Well, of course,
but I meant about Nathan.

21:10.091 --> 21:11.592
What about him?

21:11.593 --> 21:14.428
They didn't tell you.

21:16.638 --> 21:19.058
Clay, Nate's missing.

21:19.059 --> 21:21.068
He landed in Tree Hill
two days ago,

21:21.069 --> 21:22.186
and he never came home.

21:22.187 --> 21:24.872
The police
are involved now.

21:24.873 --> 21:27.858
I'm... I'm sorry.
I thought you knew.

21:27.859 --> 21:29.693
When's the last time you heard
from him?

21:29.694 --> 21:33.213
Uh... A voice-mail.

21:33.214 --> 21:35.749
He was scouting the euro camps
and said,

21:35.750 --> 21:38.118
"I'm gonna be going off
the beaten path."

21:38.119 --> 21:41.205
Why the hell did it take two
days for me to hear about this?

21:41.206 --> 21:42.840
We're all just learning
about it.

21:42.841 --> 21:44.475
Listen, I'm gonna look
into some things

33:28.234 --> 33:29.634
You're their only link
to this.

33:29.635 --> 33:31.770
Eventually, they're gonna find
a reason to kill you, too.

33:31.771 --> 33:32.832

when are you gonna be the man?

33:36.326 --> 33:37.976
I <i>am</i> the man.

33:37.977 --> 33:39.923
- Say the word!
- You're the man's bitch! Be the man!

33:39.924 --> 33:41.549
- Say it!
- Enough!

33:41.550 --> 33:45.428
The phone rings, he dies.
That's it.

33:45.429 --> 33:47.347

wait, wait.

33:47.348 --> 33:50.100

33:50.101 --> 33:55.313
But what's to say phone rings,
we get rich?

33:55.314 --> 33:57.880
I'm here to kill a man.

33:57.881 --> 34:00.549

Okay.

34:40.693 --> 34:42.694

34:42.695 --> 34:45.487
And now I'm going
to ransom you.

34:45.489 --> 34:46.844

34:47.156 --> 34:49.242

35:14.226 --> 35:15.536
Which one?

35:16.852 --> 35:17.896
I'm curious.

35:17.897 --> 35:20.273
It's none
of your business.

35:20.274 --> 35:22.009
They went to a strip club,

35:22.010 --> 35:23.878
so I'm sure you'll see them

35:23.879 --> 35:26.029

you can keep this up?

35:37.708 --> 35:40.895
Well, Chris Keller has
volunteered to play here

35:40.896 --> 35:43.922
whenever we need him,
so as long as <i>you're</i> here.

35:43.923 --> 35:48.009
