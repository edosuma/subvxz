Beau Randolph, you're a creep!

00:14.386 --> 00:15.448
You're a loser!

00:18.508 --> 00:21.210
You peddle smut! You're scum!

00:23.477 --> 00:25.708
Your whole life adds up to nothing!

00:29.813 --> 00:31.971
Let me introduce you to the guy

00:31.972 --> 00:33.621
who's the reason we're all here.

00:33.806 --> 00:35.831
Please give it up for my friend

00:35.866 --> 00:38.984
and the founder of "College
Girls Gone Crazy" --

00:39.011 --> 00:41.595
Beau Randolph!

00:45.487 --> 00:46.460
Thank you, Troy.

00:47.209 --> 00:49.867
And welcome, all of you,
to what I know will be

00:49.868 --> 00:52.073
a night to remember.

00:54.689 --> 00:55.872
So enjoy the music,

00:55.945 --> 00:57.794
the free drinks.

00:59.016 --> 01:00.266
And thank you for being a part

01:00.267 --> 01:04.421
of "College Girls Gone Crazy:
Girls Take Manhattan"!

01:08.173 --> 01:11.561
All right. Let's get crazy!

01:27.443 --> 01:28.564
Another drink, Mr. Randolph?

01:29.647 --> 01:30.943
I'm not here to party.

01:32.447 --> 01:33.619
Not tonight.

01:33.887 --> 01:35.042
Maybe next time, then.

01:37.545 --> 01:39.657
I don't think there's gonna be a next time.

01:50.176 --> 01:51.708
Oh, no! No!

01:51.709 --> 01:55.750
Richard, you just ruined my final savasana.

01:55.751 --> 01:57.045
If you are method writing

01:57.046 --> 01:58.767
and playing the role of your murder victim,

01:58.768 --> 02:00.836
could you please die a
little bit more quietly?

02:00.837 --> 02:01.556
Thank you.

02:01.557 --> 02:02.541
No, mother, I didn't--

02:02.542 --> 02:03.490
I just--I was...

02:04.175 --> 02:07.090
I was googling... myself

02:07.091 --> 02:09.497
and I found this.

02:09.725 --> 02:12.701
Oh, I didn't know Alexis had a web site.

02:12.702 --> 02:13.921
Neither did I.

02:14.210 --> 02:16.423
It's a vlog. It's a video blog.

02:16.480 --> 02:18.708
Oh, well, that's charming.

02:18.709 --> 02:21.330
No. No, it is not charming.

02:22.975 --> 02:25.277
So tonight Max and I went ice skating

02:25.278 --> 02:27.338
at Rockefeller Center again.

02:27.339 --> 02:31.418
And, yes, I pretended to be
unsteady on my skates again.

02:31.419 --> 02:35.028
And, yes, Max caught me as I "fell" again.

02:36.433 --> 02:38.278
That is completely adorable,

02:38.279 --> 02:39.451
and the camera just loves her.

02:39.452 --> 02:40.827
Of course, she gets that from me.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.358
Mother, Alexis is sharing,

02:42.359 --> 02:44.266
with the whole world,

02:44.267 --> 02:45.845
mind you, personal,

02:45.866 --> 02:47.475
intimate details about her life--

02:47.476 --> 02:49.610
where she goes, who she goes with.

02:49.632 --> 02:50.704
This is not safe.

02:50.705 --> 02:53.592
Darling, when did you get
to be such a fuddy-duddy?

02:53.593 --> 02:56.236
Believe me, you were far worse in your day.

02:56.237 --> 02:57.840
My day is not today.

02:57.913 --> 02:58.783
That day is not today.

02:58.784 --> 03:00.977
Today is the day of the Internet stalker.

03:00.978 --> 03:02.256
Today is the day for--

03:02.257 --> 03:04.942
Darling, why don't you
just answer your phone?

03:04.943 --> 03:06.216
Oh, and it's Beckett.

03:06.217 --> 03:08.189
Maybe she has a nice murder to distract you

03:08.190 --> 03:10.166
from your parental paranoia.

03:14.491 --> 03:15.558
Namaste.

03:15.559 --> 03:17.676
So she video blogs, Castle.
So what?

03:17.677 --> 03:19.463
Plenty of people do her age.

03:19.464 --> 03:21.561
Why? Did she post something inappropriate?

03:21.562 --> 03:23.277
No, but that's not the point.

03:23.278 --> 03:24.350
Well, what is the point?

03:24.351 --> 03:25.695
The point is, she's oversharing.

03:25.696 --> 03:27.291
She doesn't realize, whatever
she posts on the Internet

03:27.292 --> 03:28.357
is out there forever.

03:28.358 --> 03:30.482
Well, at least be happy
that Alexis isn't posting

03:30.483 --> 03:32.675
something like that.
"College Girls Gone Crazy"?

03:32.676 --> 03:35.117
Yeah, brought to you by the
master of oversharing,

03:35.118 --> 03:37.191
Mr. Beau Randolph.

03:40.679 --> 03:41.558
She...

03:45.001 --> 03:46.593
It's all right to look, Castle.

03:46.780 --> 03:47.806
Look at what?

03:48.474 --> 03:50.088
So it doesn't seem as though
Beau Randolph's world

03:50.089 --> 03:51.583
has changed very much
since we interviewed him

03:51.584 --> 03:52.939
for that frozen head case.

03:52.940 --> 03:54.826
Except that he's no longer in it.

03:55.554 --> 03:57.475
Beau Randolph is our victim?

03:57.641 --> 03:59.607
He was murdered in the women's bathroom?

03:59.635 --> 04:01.754
Brings new meaning to
"College Girls Gone Crazy."

04:01.815 --> 04:02.698
Looks that way.

04:02.699 --> 04:04.419
His body was found in one of the stalls.

04:04.420 --> 04:06.109
Cause of death is strangulation.

04:06.110 --> 04:07.496
Manual or ligature?

04:07.497 --> 04:08.549
Ligature.

04:08.559 --> 04:10.539
Look at these bruises on his neck.

04:11.062 --> 04:13.324
It's from a clasp on a bra.

04:13.562 --> 04:14.449
The murder weapon was found

04:14.450 --> 04:15.770
lying next to him.

04:15.911 --> 04:17.803
I figure that a chick lured him in here

04:17.805 --> 04:19.844
for a little tryst and then choked him out.

04:19.845 --> 04:20.730
Time of death?

04:20.731 --> 04:22.768
Well, he was talking to the
bartender around 11:50,

04:22.769 --> 04:25.460
and the body was found
in the stall at 11:58 P.M.

04:25.542 --> 04:26.271
Lanie, do you think that

04:26.272 --> 04:28.184
we can get D.N.A. of of the murder weapon?

04:28.185 --> 04:30.504
I already collected samples,
but check this out.

04:30.505 --> 04:33.569
This is a 36D Sultura.

04:33.570 --> 04:34.441
Oh, that's high-end.

04:34.442 --> 04:37.987
Definitely.
One of these could run you $200, $250.

04:37.988 --> 04:40.076
$250 for a bra?

04:40.077 --> 04:42.616
Oh, but it's okay to spend that
on a pair of sneakers, right?

04:42.617 --> 04:44.431
A pair of sneakers is practical.

04:44.432 --> 04:46.647
Okay?
They can support your, um...

04:46.674 --> 04:47.746
Eject.

04:47.824 --> 04:48.387
Okay.

04:48.388 --> 04:50.293
The list of shops that sell
that can't be that long

04:50.294 --> 04:52.366
so see if you can figure
out who purchased it.

04:52.670 --> 04:54.672
Yeah.
Hey, so looks like there was a guest list

04:54.673 --> 04:55.677
at the club tonight.

04:55.678 --> 04:58.715
But if you were a guy with
20 bucks in your pocket

04:58.716 --> 04:59.567
and you showed up at the door,

04:59.568 --> 05:01.207
or a pretty girl, you got in.

05:01.208 --> 05:03.433
What about witnesses?
Anyone see who Beau was with?

05:03.434 --> 05:05.186
Not yet, but uniforms are
taking witness statements

05:05.187 --> 05:06.780
from people here and down at the precinct.

05:06.781 --> 05:08.187
They were shooting for
the web site tonight,

05:08.188 --> 05:09.526
so even if no one saw Beau,

05:09.527 --> 05:10.994
chances are someone caught him on video.

05:10.995 --> 05:12.393
Who was in charge of taping?

05:12.394 --> 05:14.565
The video's producer, a guy
named Troy Strickland.

05:14.566 --> 05:16.624
But the bigger question
is how anyone got to Beau

05:16.625 --> 05:17.579
in the first place.

05:17.580 --> 05:20.138
According to club security, he
came with a bodyguard tonight.

05:20.305 --> 05:22.010
Well, that worked out, didn't it?

05:22.011 --> 05:23.809
Okay, Espo, you and Ryan
take the bodyguard.

05:23.810 --> 05:26.040
Castle and I will talk to the producer.

05:26.136 --> 05:28.319
So where's the world's worst bodyguard?

05:28.320 --> 05:30.296
Told security to have him
meet us near the rope line.

05:30.297 --> 05:31.415
His name is Jones.

05:31.756 --> 05:32.698
This guy?

05:34.060 --> 05:34.741
Yo.

05:34.742 --> 05:35.905
You Jones?

05:36.033 --> 05:38.741
I'm Jones. Scarlet Jones.

05:40.065 --> 05:42.573
Detectives Ryan and Esposito. NYPD.

05:42.900 --> 05:44.461
You were supposed to have eyes on Beau.

05:45.503 --> 05:46.425
So what happened?

05:46.458 --> 05:48.172
Beau told me to wait outside with the car.

05:48.173 --> 05:50.592
When your boss gives you a
directive, you follow it.

05:50.821 --> 05:51.449
But it was weird.

05:51.450 --> 05:53.508
Like he didn't want me in there tonight.

05:53.575 --> 05:55.695
So you never saw him again
after he went in the club?

05:56.132 --> 05:57.208
I'm afraid not.

05:57.292 --> 05:59.838
Did you see anyone else that
seemed suspicious tonight?

05:59.839 --> 06:01.610
Look, I did my threat assessment, okay?

06:01.611 --> 06:03.078
The only one was, uh...

06:03.453 --> 06:04.462
What?

06:05.127 --> 06:07.706
Tiffany. Tiffany Shaw.

06:08.012 --> 06:09.519
Hey, that's that actress.
Right?

06:09.520 --> 06:13.186
She does soft-core, cable type of...
So I've heard.

06:13.187 --> 06:14.623
That's also Beau's ex-girlfriend.

06:14.624 --> 06:16.091
He tried to dump her two months ago,

06:16.092 --> 06:17.653
but she wouldn't take no for an answer.

06:17.799 --> 06:19.556
He got a restraining order against her,

06:19.557 --> 06:20.821
and that still didn't keep her away.

06:20.822 --> 06:22.243
And she was here tonight?

06:22.244 --> 06:23.391
She tried to get into the club,

06:23.392 --> 06:24.998
and I stopped her at the rope line.

06:25.431 --> 06:26.609
I told her I would call the police

06:26.610 --> 06:28.342
if she didn't walk away, so she did.

06:28.639 --> 06:30.048
Any chance she came back?

06:30.275 --> 06:31.300
Not through me.

06:33.394 --> 06:34.906
But I couldn't cover every door.

06:36.620 --> 06:38.743
Yeah, I've known Tiffany for a long time.

06:39.589 --> 06:41.083
She's a crazy chick,

06:41.292 --> 06:42.745
and definitely obsessed with Beau.

06:42.746 --> 06:44.562
But I didn't see her in the club tonight.

06:44.563 --> 06:46.171
What did you see, if anything?

06:46.280 --> 06:50.025
Uh, just pretty girls and good,
clean, all-American fun.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.182
Man, this sucks.

06:52.711 --> 06:54.450
I've been with Beau since the beginning.

06:55.386 --> 06:56.976
I was his first cameraman,

06:57.373 --> 06:58.586
first producer.

07:01.199 --> 07:02.966
We barely knew what we were doing.

07:04.480 --> 07:05.602
Did he have any family?

07:05.603 --> 07:08.127
No, his mom left when he was little.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.400
He never knew his dad.

07:10.266 --> 07:11.598
I think it's what drove him.

07:11.599 --> 07:14.165
You know, this company was
the family he never had.

07:14.606 --> 07:16.213
People thought he was this sleaze,

07:16.248 --> 07:17.921
surrounding himself with all these women,

07:17.922 --> 07:21.923
but it's because he was looking
for something he couldn't find.

07:22.988 --> 07:23.921
Troy, we're gonna need to see

07:23.922 --> 07:25.333
the footage that you shot tonight.

07:25.334 --> 07:27.228
There might be evidence on it.
Troy.

07:27.229 --> 07:29.016
Yeah, whatever you-- whatever you want.

07:29.568 --> 07:30.624
Hey, Gary.

07:30.625 --> 07:31.522
Hey, man.

07:31.914 --> 07:33.589
I got down here as soon as I heard, buddy.

07:33.590 --> 07:34.987
Yeah. It's just so awful.

07:34.988 --> 07:35.710
Yeah, yeah.

07:35.711 --> 07:37.112
Uh, detective Beckett, Mr. Castle,

07:37.113 --> 07:38.879
this is Gary Moore, our C.O.O.

07:38.911 --> 07:40.568
Uh, I'll go get that footage for you.

07:41.502 --> 07:43.594
Look, do you--do you have
any idea who did this?

07:43.640 --> 07:45.537
Right now we're looking into Tiffany Shaw.

07:45.538 --> 07:46.575
Is there anyone else that you think

07:46.576 --> 07:47.889
might have wanted to harm Beau?

07:47.890 --> 07:49.528
Well, unfortunately,

07:49.529 --> 07:51.961
he received death threats on a daily basis.

07:52.246 --> 07:53.073
From whom?

07:53.074 --> 07:56.063
Moral crusaders, um, angry boyfriends,

07:56.064 --> 07:57.489
angry fathers...

07:57.945 --> 08:01.904
women who had second thoughts
about being in our videos.

08:01.905 --> 08:04.048
Did you keep track of these threats?

08:04.049 --> 08:06.410
Yeah, we have a database
back at our offices.

08:06.519 --> 08:07.978
We'll need you to take us there.

08:11.686 --> 08:12.582
Yo.

08:12.733 --> 08:14.878
How's the in-breast-igation going?

08:15.638 --> 08:17.793
And that's why you're still single.

08:17.992 --> 08:20.723
So I just got off the phone
with Tiffany Shaw's P.R. rep.

08:20.724 --> 08:23.396
Not only does she wear a 36D
like our murder weapon,

08:23.671 --> 08:25.244
but they can't locate her.

08:25.396 --> 08:26.370
Well, neither can I.

08:26.371 --> 08:28.141
So far she's not in any of this footage

08:28.142 --> 08:29.294
that we got from Troy.

08:29.646 --> 08:30.344
To tell you the truth,

08:30.345 --> 08:31.789
what happens in those club bathrooms,

08:31.790 --> 08:33.642
that bra could've been
left behind by anyone.

08:33.643 --> 08:35.769
Yeah, and we still got over a
hundred statements to take.

08:35.770 --> 08:37.073
We're gonna be here all night.

08:37.621 --> 08:38.602
Well, maybe not.

08:39.211 --> 08:40.750
Look. Check it out.
It's Beau.

08:41.955 --> 08:42.707
You--you see that?

08:42.708 --> 08:44.256
He--he turns his head

08:44.480 --> 08:46.445
like he sees something

08:46.819 --> 08:47.892
or someone.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.314
And it's at 11:50.

08:49.315 --> 08:51.035
That's right around the time of the murder.

08:53.509 --> 08:54.308
Look.

08:55.720 --> 08:58.278
He walks right by those women.
They're watching him go.

08:58.279 --> 08:59.226
Wait a minute.

08:59.697 --> 09:00.783
The girl in pink...

09:05.091 --> 09:07.804
She's here.
She saw where Beau went.

09:09.771 --> 09:10.976
Yeah, that's me.

09:11.193 --> 09:12.255
I-I didn't want to go,

09:12.256 --> 09:14.210
but one of my girlfriends dragged me out.

09:14.543 --> 09:16.309
Now I'm stuck in the middle of all this.

09:16.310 --> 09:17.584
Better than in the middle.

09:17.755 --> 09:19.709
You saw where he went just
before he was murdered.

09:19.710 --> 09:21.401
You might have been the last
person to see him alive.

09:21.402 --> 09:23.538
Ms. Mayfield, when he walked by you,

09:23.539 --> 09:25.900
did you see where he was
going or what he was doing?

09:25.991 --> 09:29.122
The lights were flashing.
It was pretty hard to see.

09:29.744 --> 09:32.276
I'm sorry. I've never
even seen the guy before.

09:35.364 --> 09:36.965
Is there usually a guard on duty?

09:36.966 --> 09:38.639
Well, yeah, he-- he leaves at 6:00,

09:38.640 --> 09:41.328
but we can still access our database

09:41.329 --> 09:42.930
from his workstation here.

09:42.931 --> 09:44.411
Okay, I'd like to focus
on all of the threats

09:44.412 --> 09:46.055
from the last six months or so.

09:46.335 --> 09:47.573
Is this an entry log?

09:47.843 --> 09:48.964
Uh, yes.
Why?

09:49.047 --> 09:49.988
It says that Beau Randolph

09:49.989 --> 09:52.733
swiped his key card at 12:09 A.M.

09:52.734 --> 09:54.261
That's impossible. He was already dead.

09:54.262 --> 09:55.693
Our killer stole the card

09:55.694 --> 09:57.803
and then gained entry into this building.

09:57.804 --> 09:58.792
What were they after?

09:58.793 --> 09:59.694
According to this,

09:59.695 --> 10:03.046
whoever used that key card
went into Beau's office.

10:03.387 --> 10:05.019
Are there security cameras in there?

10:05.707 --> 10:06.814
Pulling it up now.

10:10.022 --> 10:11.503
He's going for the safe.

10:11.922 --> 10:13.842
Beau just had that installed.

10:13.843 --> 10:14.803
What does he keep in there?

10:14.804 --> 10:15.458
I don't know,

10:15.459 --> 10:18.027
but when it came to that safe, he was...

10:18.399 --> 10:19.614
pretty paranoid.

10:24.462 --> 10:25.524
That's an S.D. card.

10:25.525 --> 10:27.372
Come on.
Turn around.

10:30.696 --> 10:31.628
Oh, my God.

10:32.022 --> 10:34.042
That's Beau Randolph's bodyguard.

10:35.356 --> 10:37.186
Well, she's not very good at her job.

10:38.078 --> 10:46.493

10:49.804 --> 10:50.523
Good news is,

10:50.524 --> 10:53.242
Scarlet Jones is not the
world's worst bodyguard.

10:53.243 --> 10:55.495
Bad news is, she's a murderer.

10:55.571 --> 10:57.719
Someone that sexy going to prison?

10:57.720 --> 10:59.540
That in itself is a crime.

11:01.392 --> 11:02.695
Is this really necessary?

11:02.696 --> 11:04.484
I told your detectives everything I know.

11:04.485 --> 11:05.489
Not everything.

11:05.835 --> 11:07.297
For instance, you didn't tell us

11:07.298 --> 11:09.075
that you had been working for Mr. Randolph

11:09.076 --> 11:10.490
for only a couple of weeks.

11:10.783 --> 11:11.937
How is that relevant?

11:11.938 --> 11:13.708
Well, in your statement, you said that

11:13.709 --> 11:16.501
when Beau went into the club,
you stayed with the limo.

11:16.728 --> 11:18.230
That's right. That's what I did.

11:18.427 --> 11:20.222
So then maybe you can explain this.

11:21.036 --> 11:22.095
That appears to be you

11:22.096 --> 11:23.926
stealing an S.D. card.

11:24.052 --> 11:26.099
And before you say "evil twin," just know--

11:26.485 --> 11:27.544
It's been done.

11:27.603 --> 11:29.599
You broke in to his
office just after he died

11:29.600 --> 11:31.159
using his key card.

11:31.632 --> 11:33.096
How did you get it?

11:33.158 --> 11:34.632
Look, I didn't kill Beau,

11:34.633 --> 11:36.300
and certainly not for his key card.

11:36.307 --> 11:40.004
He left it in the limo.
I knew it was my only chance.

11:40.005 --> 11:41.360
What do you mean, only chance?

11:42.098 --> 11:44.667
There was this... sex tape.

11:46.185 --> 11:47.568
This friend of mine made the mistake

11:47.569 --> 11:48.869
of sleeping with Beau,

11:48.870 --> 11:50.399
and he videotaped it.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.792
She knew that if it ever got out,

11:51.793 --> 11:52.842
it would destroy her life,

11:52.843 --> 11:56.417
so I took this job to make
sure the tape never got out.

11:56.479 --> 11:58.374
When Beau told me to stay with the car,

11:58.537 --> 11:59.747
I knew it was my only shot,

11:59.748 --> 12:02.078
so, yes, I-I broke in to his office,

12:02.079 --> 12:04.247
I took the S.D. card, and I destroyed it.

12:04.248 --> 12:05.539
But that's all I did.

12:05.540 --> 12:07.085
And who is this friend of yours?

12:07.158 --> 12:08.590
Her name is Mindy Norton.

12:09.558 --> 12:12.801
Like I told your detectives,
the killer must be Tiffany.

12:12.978 --> 12:15.083
She hated Beau for breaking up with her.

12:15.084 --> 12:17.620
Look, she--she must have
snuck back into the club

12:17.621 --> 12:18.487
while I was gone.

12:18.488 --> 12:19.749
We reviewed the video footage.

12:19.750 --> 12:21.490
There's no evidence
Tiffany was at the club.

12:21.491 --> 12:24.277
In fact, all of the evidence points to you.

12:25.135 --> 12:26.693
Beau died after 11:50.

12:26.694 --> 12:28.141
That gave you enough time to kill him,

12:28.142 --> 12:30.096
take the S.D. card,
and get back to the club.

12:30.097 --> 12:33.670
No, I left for Beau's office at 11:45.

12:33.671 --> 12:35.623
The valets saw me drive off.

12:35.905 --> 12:38.561
I am telling you, somebody else did this.

12:38.562 --> 12:40.312
And if it wasn't Tiffany, then...

12:42.310 --> 12:44.107
I think I might know who.

12:44.199 --> 12:45.955
Last week there was this guy in midtown.

12:46.191 --> 12:48.157
He practically attacked Beau in the street,

12:48.158 --> 12:49.590
saying that he would make Beau pay

12:49.591 --> 12:50.990
for whatever it was he did.

12:50.991 --> 12:52.415
Do you know who this guy was?

12:52.520 --> 12:54.126
No, but he got in Beau's face.

12:54.482 --> 12:56.374
And he was yelling at Beau,

12:56.375 --> 12:58.149
saying that he had double-crossed him.

12:58.150 --> 13:00.958
He got physical, so I, uh, stepped in.

13:01.072 --> 13:02.218
And then what?

13:03.421 --> 13:06.368
Broke his nose and a
couple of ribs, I think.

13:06.506 --> 13:08.505
Oh, did you hear that?
She broke his nose.

13:08.506 --> 13:09.354
Yeah, so?

13:09.355 --> 13:11.670
So... that's hot.

13:13.184 --> 13:14.470
Who are you?

13:14.845 --> 13:16.967
And you have no idea who he is?

13:17.442 --> 13:20.473
No, but I'd know if I saw him again.

13:25.373 --> 13:27.845
So... Scarlet's friend
Mindy confirmed her story

13:27.846 --> 13:28.710
about the sex tape.

13:28.711 --> 13:31.628
Plus two of the valets saw
her leave the club at 11:45.

13:31.629 --> 13:33.027
So it looks like her alibi is checking out.

13:33.028 --> 13:35.660
You know, you seem unusually
happy about this.

13:35.996 --> 13:37.593
No, I'm just, you know--

13:37.911 --> 13:38.869
you know, working the case.

13:38.870 --> 13:39.710
Speaking of which,

13:39.711 --> 13:41.335
we're still trying to
track down Tiffany Shaw,

13:41.336 --> 13:42.164
but no luck so far.

13:42.165 --> 13:44.507
Meantime, Scarlet's working
with a sketch artist

13:44.508 --> 13:45.769
on Beau's attacker.

13:45.770 --> 13:48.205
When it's done, send it off
to hospital emergency rooms.

13:48.206 --> 13:49.974
If she did as much damage as she claims,

13:49.975 --> 13:51.769
then he would've sought medical attention.

13:51.770 --> 13:53.597
I should probably go see how
the sketch is coming along.

13:53.598 --> 13:55.151
Yeah, you do that.

13:56.658 --> 13:57.890
So I've been working through

13:57.891 --> 14:00.026
the threat database from
Beau Randolph's office.

14:00.027 --> 14:01.056
Did anything pop?

14:01.057 --> 14:02.862
Yeah. One guy.
Ronald Armstrong.

14:02.863 --> 14:04.614
Founder of voices for decency.

14:04.615 --> 14:06.493
Is that the guy that's on TV all the time,

14:06.494 --> 14:08.260
the one that's pushing
a conservative agenda

14:08.261 --> 14:10.376
on media groups and community businesses?

14:10.377 --> 14:11.747
Yeah, that's him.
He's the one

14:11.748 --> 14:13.596
who organized the protest
outside the nightclub.

14:13.597 --> 14:15.317
Really?
Any reason to believe that he's violent?

14:15.318 --> 14:16.806
Well, here is a quote

14:16.807 --> 14:19.352
from Armstrong on his web
site to his followers.

14:19.353 --> 14:21.817
"Our work is to rid the nation
of the purveyors of filth.

14:21.818 --> 14:23.892
"If Beau Randolph doesn't heed our voices,

14:23.893 --> 14:25.492
he must fall to our wrath."

14:25.493 --> 14:27.176
But does that make him a suspect?

14:27.177 --> 14:28.255
Well, maybe not him personally,

14:28.256 --> 14:30.491
but two weeks ago, Armstrong organized

14:30.492 --> 14:32.628
another protest outside
Beau Randolph's loft.

14:32.629 --> 14:34.939
Windows were broken.
Beau was burned in effigy.

14:34.940 --> 14:35.609
It got pretty ugly.

14:35.610 --> 14:36.906
Those same protesters

14:36.907 --> 14:38.822
were outside the nightclub last night.

14:41.484 --> 14:43.810
Mr. Randolph's death was like his life--

14:44.347 --> 14:45.301
vulgar...

14:46.020 --> 14:47.414
offensive.

14:47.579 --> 14:49.470
Look what's become of our nation.

14:49.471 --> 14:50.185
The truth is

14:50.186 --> 14:52.510
that the Beau Randolphs
of this world profit

14:52.511 --> 14:55.314
by degrading our culture
and everyone in it.

14:56.946 --> 14:59.827
I don't apologize for
defending moral values.

14:59.828 --> 15:02.722
The question is, how far
would you go to defend them?

15:03.732 --> 15:05.719
You recently led a protest against him

15:05.720 --> 15:07.660
that turned violent.

15:08.269 --> 15:10.725
A few of my brethren
became a bit overzealous,

15:10.726 --> 15:11.538
that's all.

15:11.539 --> 15:13.677
Maybe your words gave them encouragement.

15:13.678 --> 15:15.749
Make no mistake. We are at war.

15:15.750 --> 15:17.918
But I simply ask good people

15:18.280 --> 15:20.367
to stand up for their principles

15:20.368 --> 15:23.491
and to use any and all legal
means to force change.

15:23.515 --> 15:25.733
I will need the names of
all of the protesters

15:25.734 --> 15:27.680
that were at the club last night.

15:29.050 --> 15:31.842
And I respectfully decline your request.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.038
We can get a warrant.

15:34.039 --> 15:35.354
I doubt it.

15:35.974 --> 15:37.458
But good luck to you.

15:38.316 --> 15:39.795
Thanks for the coffee.

15:43.924 --> 15:45.729
So this is the guy that came after Beau?

15:45.730 --> 15:47.125
Yeah.
If I knew he was coming back,

15:47.126 --> 15:49.135
I'd have broken more than just his nose.

15:53.090 --> 15:54.535
Hey, look, um,

15:55.434 --> 15:58.040
about last night at the club...

15:58.456 --> 15:59.725
I'm sorry. I was--

15:59.845 --> 16:01.346
I was way out of line.

16:01.716 --> 16:03.858
Yeah. So was I.

16:04.356 --> 16:06.164
I should've come clean with you guys

16:06.283 --> 16:07.429
about everything.

16:10.842 --> 16:11.597
See ya.

16:11.598 --> 16:12.543
See you later.

16:13.436 --> 16:14.591
Hey, Scarlet.

16:16.305 --> 16:17.541
Uh...

16:19.144 --> 16:21.725
Do you think maybe we
could get a drink later?

16:22.172 --> 16:24.865
I mean, now that you're
not a suspect anymore...

16:34.030 --> 16:35.821
So this is what you do all day.

16:35.822 --> 16:36.961
Right?

16:37.092 --> 16:38.190
Whoa.

16:38.349 --> 16:40.836
No, it's work.
That's...

16:40.850 --> 16:42.034
That's a case.

16:42.076 --> 16:44.567
I know. I was just messing with you.

16:44.968 --> 16:46.639
Uh, so you wanted to see me?

16:47.618 --> 16:48.130
Yeah.

16:48.131 --> 16:49.725
So, Alexis, I, um...

16:51.186 --> 16:52.332
I found your vlog,

16:52.333 --> 16:55.545
and while it is super cute, um--

16:55.546 --> 16:56.885
Yeah, gram told me.

16:56.886 --> 16:58.963
You think I'm catnip for predators online.

16:58.964 --> 17:02.030
I-it's just, people have to
be, and especially women,

17:02.609 --> 17:06.601
need to be leery about how much
they put out into the world.

17:06.602 --> 17:09.577
I don't want to see you haunted for years

17:09.877 --> 17:11.997
by something you posted on a whim.

17:11.998 --> 17:13.910
Dad, you're acting like
I'm one of these girls

17:13.911 --> 17:16.178
who flashes the camera for
a free shot of tequila.

17:16.179 --> 17:17.602
It's just a silly vlog.

17:17.603 --> 17:19.910
With personal information.

17:20.135 --> 17:22.233
What if the wrong person sees it?

17:22.233 --> 17:23.881
You're always pushing me to get out there,

17:23.882 --> 17:24.940
experiment, have fun,

17:24.941 --> 17:26.719
but you refuse to trust me.

17:26.720 --> 17:27.479
Okay, Alexis--

17:27.480 --> 17:29.753
Dad, I'm not having this
conversation with you.

17:29.828 --> 17:31.565
I've got to go. I've got class.

17:31.977 --> 17:33.747
No, stay. I'm leaving.

17:38.953 --> 17:39.944
Anything you want to talk about?

17:39.945 --> 17:42.102
No.
No.

17:42.299 --> 17:43.380
No.

17:43.381 --> 17:45.311
Castle, over here.

17:45.312 --> 17:46.757
No, no, look.

17:46.971 --> 17:48.228
It's the guy from Scarlet's sketch.

17:48.229 --> 17:50.282
It's the man who attacked Beau.

17:50.283 --> 17:51.560
Look at his nose.

17:51.577 --> 17:53.038
That's from Scarlet hitting him.

17:53.039 --> 17:54.497
He was at the club last night,

17:54.498 --> 17:56.040
probably to finish the job.

17:56.334 --> 17:58.525
And I can tell you his name--Seth Parrino.

17:58.526 --> 18:01.084
Just got off the phone
with an E.R. nurse at Bronx General.

18:01.085 --> 18:02.554
Parrino was treated and released

18:02.555 --> 18:04.244
for a nasal fracture and some bruised ribs.

18:04.245 --> 18:05.286
What do we know about him?

18:05.287 --> 18:07.323
Well, he was no stranger to violence.

18:07.324 --> 18:09.520
He was convicted of
racketeering three years ago.

18:09.659 --> 18:10.899
You know where we can find him?

18:10.900 --> 18:14.183
Racketeering and Parrino
owns an import business?

18:14.184 --> 18:16.013
I've got two words for you, Beckett--

18:16.372 --> 18:17.517
Vito Corleone.

18:17.518 --> 18:19.408
Technically, those are names, not words.

18:19.409 --> 18:22.617
If Beau Randolph double-crossed
a member of the mafia...

18:22.656 --> 18:23.961
no wonder he got whacked.

18:23.962 --> 18:26.343
That is rampant speculation.

18:26.344 --> 18:28.293
Rampant speculation is my specialty.

18:28.294 --> 18:29.987
What if Beau Randolph produced a video

18:29.988 --> 18:32.796
featuring the daughter of a mafia boss,

18:33.118 --> 18:35.454
and the brassiere became the mafia's, uh,

18:35.455 --> 18:36.787
garrote du jour?

18:37.169 --> 18:38.351
You can stop talking now.

18:48.866 --> 18:50.349
Seth Parrino.

18:50.350 --> 18:51.535
What the hell are you doing?

18:51.536 --> 18:52.817
You can't be in here.

18:52.818 --> 18:55.291
NYPD. We have a few questions.

18:55.877 --> 18:57.504
♪ Get down, get down ♪

18:57.861 --> 18:59.913
♪ Jungle boogie
♪ Ah

18:59.984 --> 19:01.693
♪ Jungle boogie

19:01.694 --> 19:02.342
♪ Get it

19:02.343 --> 19:04.317
♪ Jungle boogie
♪ Ah

19:04.318 --> 19:05.722
♪ Jungle boogie

19:05.723 --> 19:07.045
♪ Get it ♪

19:08.133 --> 19:10.312
Maybe more than just a few questions.

19:16.351 --> 19:18.096
"College Guys Gone Nuts," really?

19:18.097 --> 19:19.723
Yeah, yeah, and I own the trademark,

19:19.724 --> 19:21.604
so don't get any ideas.
Rats.

19:21.605 --> 19:24.359
Look, everybody here is over
18, and I have my permits.

19:24.360 --> 19:26.985
We're not here about your
dancers, Mr. Parrino.

19:28.289 --> 19:29.370
Are we?

19:30.526 --> 19:31.993
Right.
No.

19:31.994 --> 19:34.511
We're here about Beau Randolph.

19:36.683 --> 19:38.872
Okay, yeah, yeah, we had a falling out.

19:38.873 --> 19:39.814
I didn't kill anybody.

19:39.815 --> 19:41.311
A falling out about what?

19:41.312 --> 19:43.753
This.
"College Guys Gone Nuts."

19:43.974 --> 19:44.709
A couple months ago,

19:44.710 --> 19:46.206
I approached him about partnering up.

19:46.207 --> 19:47.984
You know, maybe do for
women what he did for men.

19:47.985 --> 19:50.782
Can you imagine the
merchandising possibilities,

19:50.783 --> 19:53.303
DVDs, Internet, video games.

19:53.304 --> 19:54.372
You know, at first he said he was in.

19:54.373 --> 19:54.905
Then all of a sudden, boom.

19:54.906 --> 19:56.736
Just like that, changes his mind.

19:56.765 --> 19:58.006
Can't imagine why.

19:58.007 --> 19:59.888
Beau was a visionary. I grant him that.

19:59.889 --> 20:00.774
He was a visionary.

20:00.775 --> 20:02.005
But, uh, for some reason, he just--

20:02.006 --> 20:03.958
he--he couldn't-- couldn't
see it, you know?

20:03.959 --> 20:04.697
I get it. You're right.

20:04.698 --> 20:07.676
I mean, it's like wind power.
It's, uh, solar energy.

20:07.684 --> 20:08.814
Exactly.

20:09.239 --> 20:10.210
Yeah.

20:10.211 --> 20:11.417
Day this happened,

20:11.497 --> 20:12.921
I found out he was gonna
back out on the deal.

20:12.922 --> 20:14.309
Said he's gonna-- he's gonna invest

20:14.310 --> 20:15.355
in something else--

20:15.356 --> 20:17.941
Oh, kids programming or
something like that.

20:17.942 --> 20:19.855
Like I couldn't tell he
was just blowing me off.

20:19.856 --> 20:21.974
And then he sics that bodyguard on me.

20:21.975 --> 20:23.876
Why did you go to the club that night?

20:24.275 --> 20:25.959
I was trying to make a final pitch.

20:25.960 --> 20:27.142
You know, give him one more chance to--

20:27.143 --> 20:29.525
to--to say yes, one more chance to go nuts.

20:29.526 --> 20:31.019
I take it he said no.

20:31.136 --> 20:32.723
Oh, I never got a chance to ask.

20:32.724 --> 20:33.799
I ran into him in the back,

20:33.800 --> 20:35.283
and he was having a fight with some chick.

20:35.284 --> 20:36.588
It looked nasty.

20:36.589 --> 20:38.299
I just, I figured, you
know, it wasn't the time.

20:38.300 --> 20:39.606
And when was this?

20:39.697 --> 20:41.806
God, like 11:30 or so.

20:42.043 --> 20:43.046
30?

20:43.047 --> 20:44.805
Do you think you could describe this woman?

20:44.842 --> 20:48.242
Yeah, yeah, yeah, she has, uh...
short brown hair,

20:48.293 --> 20:49.588
smokin' hot body.

20:49.589 --> 20:50.624
Oh, ho, ho.

20:50.625 --> 20:53.074
Oh, and she had a mole right over her lip.

20:54.610 --> 20:56.910
Here she is--
Seth Parrino's mystery woman.

20:56.911 --> 20:58.901
All right, send her photo
to the party organizers.

20:58.902 --> 21:00.796
See if anyone recognizes her.

21:00.797 --> 21:01.870
No need.

21:01.889 --> 21:03.169
Check out that mole.

21:04.270 --> 21:05.222
Look familiar?

21:05.223 --> 21:06.555
So Beau's ex-girlfriend

21:06.556 --> 21:08.287
Tiffany Shaw was there.

21:08.288 --> 21:09.593
She must have disguised herself,

21:09.594 --> 21:11.251
then slipped in to the
club after Scarlet left.

21:11.252 --> 21:12.839
Get out a warrant on her.

21:12.840 --> 21:14.560
You think we could have Ryan do that?

21:14.561 --> 21:15.810
I have plans.

21:15.811 --> 21:18.121
Really?
Do these plans have a name?

21:20.892 --> 21:22.066
Oh, shut up.
You didn't.

21:22.067 --> 21:24.632
She broke a guy's nose.
You know she's gotta be freaky.

21:25.188 --> 21:26.171
Come on.

21:26.172 --> 21:27.214
Hey, where you going?

21:27.215 --> 21:29.068
Don't ask.
You got anything?

21:29.542 --> 21:31.858
Well, um... I never thought I'd say this

21:31.859 --> 21:33.333
after graduating the sixth grade,

21:33.334 --> 21:34.673
but our bra research is in.

21:34.674 --> 21:37.345
Turns out six women purchased a Sultura bra

21:37.346 --> 21:40.110
identical to the size and
model of our murder weapon

21:40.111 --> 21:41.980
from the same Upper East
Side lingerie shop--

21:41.981 --> 21:43.113
Carnal Desires.

21:43.114 --> 21:45.246
Of the six, one name stood out.

21:45.386 --> 21:47.176
Tiffany Shaw.
It gets better.

21:47.177 --> 21:48.580
Apparently she must have lost hers,

21:48.581 --> 21:49.999
because she called the shop this morning

21:50.000 --> 21:51.664
to see if they had another one in stock.

21:51.665 --> 21:52.857
She's on her way in to get it right now.

21:52.858 --> 21:54.404
You know, it seems like such a shame

21:54.405 --> 21:57.779
to have her buy a new one when
her old one is right here.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.358
Oh, my God.
My bra.

22:03.359 --> 22:05.559
Thank you so much.

22:05.560 --> 22:06.741
Where did you guys find this?

22:06.742 --> 22:08.613
Wrapped around Beau Randolph's neck,

22:08.614 --> 22:10.130
strangling him to death.

22:12.345 --> 22:13.545
Wait. You guys don't think

22:13.546 --> 22:15.295
that I had anything to
do with this, do you?

22:15.296 --> 22:17.879
The murder weapon belongs to you.

22:17.925 --> 22:20.900
Our victim had a restraining
order against you.

22:20.956 --> 22:24.345
And you were so determined
to get to see him that night

22:24.346 --> 22:25.982
that you changed your appearance

22:25.983 --> 22:28.035
in order to get past security.

22:28.074 --> 22:29.531
It's not what you think.

22:29.841 --> 22:31.908
Look, I just wanted to talk to him.

22:31.909 --> 22:34.258
The two of us were soul mates.

22:34.259 --> 22:36.371
And then a couple of
months ago, he changes.

22:36.428 --> 22:39.148
He got so serious, so secretive.

22:39.421 --> 22:41.833
And then out of the blue, he just dumps me

22:41.834 --> 22:43.591
for no reason.

22:43.934 --> 22:45.882
I just wanted to know why.

22:46.317 --> 22:48.404
I deserved to know why.

22:48.646 --> 22:50.859
So you went to the club

22:50.860 --> 22:51.829
to confront him.

22:51.830 --> 22:53.135
And do you know what he said?

22:53.136 --> 22:55.744
He said that I wasn't the kind of person

22:55.745 --> 22:57.726
that he could be with anymore.

22:57.797 --> 22:59.626
Like he's such a saint.

22:59.627 --> 23:01.546
And then he said if I showed up again,

23:01.547 --> 23:03.015
he'd have me arrested.

23:03.016 --> 23:05.206
That's pretty harsh.
That must have made you angry.

23:05.207 --> 23:07.189
Damn right, it made me angry.

23:07.799 --> 23:10.103
I wanted to hurt him so bad.

23:10.781 --> 23:12.814
So you went into the bathroom...

23:13.968 --> 23:15.507
and then you killed him.

23:16.955 --> 23:17.920
Wh-what?

23:17.921 --> 23:19.166
You killed him.

23:19.827 --> 23:23.718
Whoa. Okay.
No, I didn't kill him.

23:23.719 --> 23:26.216
You just said you wanted
to hurt him so bad.

23:26.217 --> 23:26.787
Yeah,

23:26.788 --> 23:27.833
so I grabbed the nearest guy

23:27.834 --> 23:30.729
and pulled him into the
bathroom for revenge sex.

23:31.416 --> 23:32.975
Then how did your bra end up

23:32.976 --> 23:35.130
wrapped around Beau Randolph's neck?

23:35.299 --> 23:37.828
I must have left it in the bathroom.

23:39.568 --> 23:41.732
You ever do it in a nightclub, detective,

23:41.733 --> 23:43.465
hot, sweaty, quick?

23:44.255 --> 23:45.744
Things go missing.

23:48.660 --> 23:50.284
Can this guy confirm your story?

23:50.285 --> 23:51.772
Confirm it?

23:51.829 --> 23:53.387
I mean, knowing men, he's probably told

23:53.388 --> 23:55.317
the entire east coast already.

23:55.382 --> 23:56.609
So what's his name?

23:59.628 --> 24:00.303
You don't know his name.

24:00.304 --> 24:02.162
It was club sex.

24:02.744 --> 24:04.973
Look, I know it was stupid.

24:05.161 --> 24:08.358
Afterward, I felt awful, so I left.

24:08.359 --> 24:09.575
And what time was that?

24:09.576 --> 24:12.493
Around 11:45.
You can call my driver.

24:13.545 --> 24:14.992
And when I walked out of that club,

24:14.993 --> 24:16.849
Beau was still alive.

24:17.179 --> 24:18.958
Look, I knew Beau better than anyone,

24:18.959 --> 24:20.802
and something wasn't right.

24:20.803 --> 24:22.605
I could see it in his eyes.

24:22.606 --> 24:24.083
At first I thought it was another woman,

24:24.084 --> 24:26.483
so I followed him to find out who it was.

24:26.586 --> 24:28.790
But when I saw what that
bodyguard of his was up to,

24:28.791 --> 24:30.967
I knew it was something bigger.

24:30.968 --> 24:32.003
What was she up to?

24:32.004 --> 24:33.582
Nothing good.

24:33.583 --> 24:35.580
A couple of weeks ago, I followed her.

24:35.861 --> 24:37.473
She was crossing Bryant park.

24:37.474 --> 24:39.290
And suddenly, she reaches into a trash bin

24:39.291 --> 24:41.031
and pulls out this--

24:41.586 --> 24:43.388
A bag of cash.

24:46.155 --> 24:48.533
So the mystery of Scarlet deepens.

24:48.802 --> 24:51.598
A dead drop involving a bag
of cash and a trash bin,

24:51.599 --> 24:54.011
sending us after false
leads at every turn--

24:54.012 --> 24:55.725
This is classic spy craft.

24:55.726 --> 24:58.297
But whose money is it and who
is she really working for?

24:58.298 --> 25:00.792
Scarlet's last few jobs were
doing high-level consulting

25:00.793 --> 25:02.738
for fortune-500 companies.

25:02.739 --> 25:05.556
That's a far cry from
babysitting Beau Randolph.

25:05.557 --> 25:07.269
Maybe she's still working for one of them.

25:07.270 --> 25:08.715
Maybe her job with Beau was just to get

25:08.716 --> 25:10.815
close enough to him to
accomplish her real mission.

25:10.816 --> 25:11.924
Yeah, whatever that was.

25:11.925 --> 25:14.689
Hey, so I just spoke with
Scarlet's friend Mindy.

25:14.690 --> 25:15.589
After I explained to her

25:15.590 --> 25:17.055
what obstruction of justice looks like,

25:17.056 --> 25:19.414
she admitted that Scarlet paid her $1,000

25:19.415 --> 25:21.531
to vouch for that story
about the S.D. card.

25:21.532 --> 25:22.433
Whatever's on it,

25:22.434 --> 25:24.253
it's not a sex tape of her and Beau.

25:24.254 --> 25:26.466
Okay, so what the hell is it and
why does she want it so bad?

25:26.467 --> 25:28.574
You know, I think I know
how we can find out.

25:31.678 --> 25:32.490
Pretty much everything.

25:32.491 --> 25:33.188
You're super strong.

25:33.189 --> 25:34.740
I'm just saying.

25:38.171 --> 25:39.347
Is everything okay?

25:39.348 --> 25:41.193
It's-- nah, it's just work.

25:41.194 --> 25:43.355
It seems like they can't
operate without me sometimes.

25:43.820 --> 25:45.178
You know how it is.

25:46.166 --> 25:47.188
So do you want to get another drink

25:47.189 --> 25:49.195
or maybe get a table and get some dinner?

25:49.922 --> 25:52.154
How about we continue this conversation

25:52.155 --> 25:53.334
at my place?

25:54.776 --> 25:55.979
Okay.

25:56.344 --> 25:57.423
Or...

25:57.424 --> 25:58.704
better yet...

25:59.482 --> 26:01.108
why don't we continue this conversation

26:01.109 --> 26:02.819
back at my place?

26:10.485 --> 26:11.747
She's hot.

26:12.856 --> 26:14.792
She kicks ass.
She's a corporate spy.

26:14.793 --> 26:16.487
Man, she is perfect.

26:17.059 --> 26:18.811
Why'd she have to be the bad guy?

26:19.195 --> 26:21.261
Sorry we had to cop block you, bro.

26:22.746 --> 26:24.277
You know this is ridiculous.

26:24.278 --> 26:26.856
I had nothing to do with
Beau Randolph's death.

26:26.857 --> 26:27.530
I also know

26:27.531 --> 26:29.679
that you lied to us.
I have an alibi.

26:29.680 --> 26:31.761
What was on the S.D. card
and who do you work for?

26:31.762 --> 26:33.084
I already told you.

26:33.085 --> 26:36.571
You didn't take that job
to get back a sex tape.

26:36.609 --> 26:38.724
And your friend Mindy
already recanted her story.

26:38.725 --> 26:40.774
And I highly doubt that Beau paid you

26:40.775 --> 26:42.433
by leaving cash in a trash bin.

26:42.434 --> 26:43.250
So why don't you drop the act

26:43.251 --> 26:44.983
and tell me what the hell is going on

26:44.984 --> 26:47.155
and what was on that card?

26:47.921 --> 26:48.675
I don't know.

26:48.676 --> 26:50.376
Scarlet.
I don't know.

26:50.377 --> 26:51.944
Do you actually expect me to believe

26:51.945 --> 26:52.864
that you have no idea

26:52.865 --> 26:54.666
what was on the thing that you stole?

26:54.667 --> 26:59.066
All I know is that Beau was
obsessed about it, paranoid.

26:59.073 --> 27:01.593
So I figured it's exactly what
my employer was looking for.

27:01.594 --> 27:03.021
What did they send you to find?

27:03.302 --> 27:04.311
Dirt.

27:04.312 --> 27:07.113
Uh, incriminating evidence
they could use against Beau.

27:07.114 --> 27:10.217
Who?
Who's your employer?

27:12.401 --> 27:14.466
Scarlet, I'm gonna find out
whether you tell me or not,

27:14.467 --> 27:16.519
and if they were involved
in Beau Randolph's death,

27:16.520 --> 27:19.517
then that makes you an
accomplice unless you help.

27:26.565 --> 27:28.694
Little Frog Enterprises.

27:29.425 --> 27:31.954
I was hired by Little Frog Enterprises.

27:31.955 --> 27:35.164
Little Frog Enterprises, the
children's media company?

27:35.190 --> 27:36.604
That makes no sense.

27:37.205 --> 27:39.369
Beau told Seth Parrino
that he was investing

27:39.370 --> 27:40.964
in children's programming,

27:40.965 --> 27:42.361
so maybe it's related.

27:42.362 --> 27:45.071
So what, the folks behind "The Jigglewags"

27:45.072 --> 27:46.834
and "Happy Polly's Puppet Playtime"

27:46.835 --> 27:49.103
are the people pulling the
strings behind Beau's death?

27:49.104 --> 27:50.690
Well, all we know for sure
is that they were trying

27:50.691 --> 27:52.602
to dig up some dirt on Beau.

27:52.603 --> 27:54.054
The man's life was dirt.

27:54.055 --> 27:56.157
He hardly had a sexual encounter
he didn't try to monetize.

27:56.158 --> 27:57.576
What are they hoping to find?

27:57.577 --> 28:00.126
And what were they
planning on doing with it?

28:03.475 --> 28:04.520
I'm sorry, detective,

28:04.521 --> 28:06.348
but, uh, you got the wrong guy.

28:06.349 --> 28:09.412
I, uh, I work in wholesome
family entertainment,

28:09.413 --> 28:10.598
not smut.

28:10.607 --> 28:13.297
And yet you or someone from your company

28:13.298 --> 28:14.893
hired Scarlet Jones

28:14.894 --> 28:16.933
to infiltrate Beau Randolph's company

28:16.934 --> 28:17.920
and spy on him.

28:17.921 --> 28:19.366
We figured as founder and C.E.O.,

28:19.367 --> 28:21.390
you might know something about that.

28:22.497 --> 28:23.564
Look, you have to understand.

28:23.565 --> 28:27.527
I... I built this company
for my children, okay,

28:27.528 --> 28:28.834
for my grandchildren,

28:28.835 --> 28:30.045
so parents wouldn't have to worry

28:30.046 --> 28:32.949
about their kids being
exposed to sex and violence.

28:33.015 --> 28:34.979
I'm sorry.
What does this have to do with Beau?

28:36.090 --> 28:37.713
We expanded too quickly.

28:38.491 --> 28:40.228
Sharks were circling.

28:40.229 --> 28:43.397
Six weeks ago, Beau Randolph approached me

28:43.398 --> 28:45.438
and, uh, he said he could help.

28:45.439 --> 28:47.667
He said he had large cash reserves

28:47.668 --> 28:50.088
and he was looking to invest.

28:50.089 --> 28:52.637
Why would Beau want to
invest in Lttle Frog?

28:52.638 --> 28:54.518
He said that, uh, he didn't want

28:54.519 --> 28:56.549
"College Girls Gone
Crazy" to be his legacy.

28:56.550 --> 28:58.177
He said he wanted to do more.

28:58.247 --> 28:59.370
He liked the company.

28:59.371 --> 29:01.065
I take it you weren't interested.

29:01.066 --> 29:02.808
What, and let that guy's sleazy reputation

29:02.809 --> 29:05.002
taint everything I worked so hard to build?

29:05.003 --> 29:07.220
No. I knew exactly what he was doing.

29:07.221 --> 29:08.798
He was trying to use my company

29:08.799 --> 29:10.967
to legitimize himself.

29:11.028 --> 29:12.850
He wanted to use it to obtain something

29:12.851 --> 29:14.574
he couldn't earn on his own.

29:14.575 --> 29:15.747
And what's that?

29:18.353 --> 29:19.366
Respect.

29:19.367 --> 29:22.613
After I said no, he took
his proposal to the board.

29:23.187 --> 29:24.416
They seemed to like his offer.

29:24.417 --> 29:26.507
I was just looking for some leverage.

29:26.508 --> 29:28.718
I just needed something
to make him back off.

29:28.719 --> 29:30.015
Are you sure about that?

29:30.016 --> 29:31.635
'Cause given everything
you've already done,

29:31.636 --> 29:32.883
it would've been easy to hire someone

29:32.884 --> 29:35.991
to slip into that party
and just make it go away.

29:37.105 --> 29:39.470
I had nothing to do with his death.

29:41.377 --> 29:42.993
But I might know who did.

29:43.778 --> 29:44.907
Scarlet...

29:44.952 --> 29:48.184
said he guarded this S.D. card
with his life.

29:49.967 --> 29:51.154
Now I know why.

29:51.471 --> 29:54.811
I thought I could use it as
leverage against Randolph,

29:54.812 --> 29:56.542
but, uh,

29:56.717 --> 29:57.726
well, now it's pretty clear

29:57.727 --> 29:59.585
he was using it to blackmail someone else.

29:59.646 --> 30:00.700
What's on it?

30:01.820 --> 30:02.928
It's not what.

30:04.828 --> 30:05.904
It's who.

30:09.171 --> 30:10.534
It's a sex tape.
So what?

30:10.535 --> 30:12.083
A guy like Beau could have dozens of these.

30:12.084 --> 30:13.546
It's not the tape.
It's the girl.

30:13.547 --> 30:15.381
I need a shot of her face.

30:19.849 --> 30:20.983
We know her.

30:21.195 --> 30:22.601
That's the girl in pink from the nightclub.

30:22.602 --> 30:23.633
Yeah.
We took her statement that night.

30:23.634 --> 30:25.024
She said didn't know Beau.

30:25.025 --> 30:27.849
Well... I think she lied.

30:28.665 --> 30:30.078
So what's her name?

30:30.779 --> 30:32.548
Candice Mayfield, 25.

30:32.549 --> 30:33.869
According to your report,

30:33.870 --> 30:36.069
she is literally one of the last people

30:36.070 --> 30:38.002
to see Beau Randolph alive.

30:38.003 --> 30:39.412
Okay. So what's so special about her?

30:39.413 --> 30:40.791
As far as I could see, nothing.

30:40.792 --> 30:42.200
She's a kindergarten teacher.

30:42.201 --> 30:44.587
No record. There's nothing
extraordinary about her.

30:44.588 --> 30:46.473
Except for maybe who her father is.

30:46.474 --> 30:47.390
According to court documents

30:47.391 --> 30:50.301
Candice Mayfield's real
name is Candice Armstrong--

30:50.302 --> 30:51.605
Ronald Armstrong's daughter.

30:51.606 --> 30:54.150
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
This Ronald Armstrong?

30:54.151 --> 30:56.182
The founder of voices for
decency Ronald Armstrong?

30:56.183 --> 30:58.418
Mm-hmm. The one who's trying
to bring down Beau's company.

30:58.419 --> 31:00.392
And Armstrong's daughter changed her name

31:00.393 --> 31:02.767
to her mom's maiden to get
away from all the notoriety.

31:02.768 --> 31:05.380
Only Beau found out who she really was.

31:05.381 --> 31:07.421
So Beau lures her into a tawdry encounter,

31:07.422 --> 31:10.359
films it, and then uses the
video to blackmail her.

31:10.360 --> 31:14.464
And if she didn't agree to get
her father off of his back,

31:14.714 --> 31:16.082
Beau was going to show the tape.

31:16.083 --> 31:17.981
Candice knows that if that tape got out,

31:17.982 --> 31:19.278
it would ruin her life.

31:19.279 --> 31:21.177
It would embarrass her whole family.

31:21.178 --> 31:23.038
Beau uses the video to
push her into a corner.

31:23.039 --> 31:24.799
She has no choice but to push back.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.128
She's our killer.

31:34.739 --> 31:36.022
So what brings you home,

31:36.023 --> 31:39.314
aside from concocting a
ridiculously huge dessert?

31:39.315 --> 31:40.688
Kudos, by the way.

31:41.742 --> 31:43.175
I hate it when we argue.

31:43.176 --> 31:44.177
Me, too.

31:44.636 --> 31:46.752
It's just, I'm 18.

31:47.126 --> 31:49.496
I don't have to ask for permission anymore.

31:49.497 --> 31:50.626
No, I know that.

31:50.627 --> 31:53.838
And I want you to experience
things the way I did.

31:53.839 --> 31:55.744
It's just, things are different now.

31:56.580 --> 31:59.001
If this case has taught
me anything, it's that...

31:59.002 --> 32:01.000
when you put something out there,

32:01.001 --> 32:02.020
anyone can see it,

32:02.021 --> 32:06.379
from a future job interviewer
to an Internet creep.

32:07.614 --> 32:09.066
You don't think I know that?

32:09.067 --> 32:11.516
My generation grew up
in a digital fish bowl.

32:11.517 --> 32:12.901
And no matter how careful we are,

32:12.902 --> 32:14.582
stuff will get out there.

32:14.676 --> 32:16.360
You know, friends will tag me in photos,

32:16.361 --> 32:18.507
inevitably doing something stupid.

32:18.720 --> 32:20.838
Why should that define me?

32:21.042 --> 32:23.236
Why can't I go out there and define myself?

32:23.237 --> 32:25.044
No, I get it, Alexis.
It's just that I w--

32:25.045 --> 32:26.356
Dad, look, I know.

32:26.357 --> 32:28.604
I know you want to keep me safe, but...

32:28.917 --> 32:31.577
the only way to do that
is wrap me in bubble wrap

32:31.578 --> 32:33.343
and hide me in a cave.

32:34.188 --> 32:35.108
Believe me...

32:35.127 --> 32:36.572
I've thought about it.

32:37.915 --> 32:38.760
The thing is, Alexis,

32:38.761 --> 32:41.910
there are bad people out
there who do bad things,

32:41.911 --> 32:44.166
and the more you expose...

32:44.283 --> 32:45.734
Dad, you know me.

32:45.910 --> 32:47.018
I'm careful

32:47.019 --> 32:48.241
and smart.

32:49.764 --> 32:53.194
But... I need to live my life my way.

32:54.718 --> 32:55.831
All right.

32:56.987 --> 32:59.445
But that doesn't mean I'm
gonna stop worrying.

32:59.446 --> 33:02.319
It doesn't mean I'm gonna stop caring or...

33:02.349 --> 33:04.278
reminding you from time to time

33:04.279 --> 33:07.596
that you are, indeed... wrong.

33:09.549 --> 33:11.435
And I wouldn't want you to.

33:18.620 --> 33:19.508
I don't understand.

33:19.509 --> 33:21.101
Why did I have to come back here?

33:21.102 --> 33:25.244
Because you didn't tell us
the whole story, Candice.

33:28.776 --> 33:30.365
12 seconds after Beau left,

33:30.366 --> 33:32.170
you headed off in the same direction.

33:32.171 --> 33:33.387
Well, I didn't follow him,

33:33.388 --> 33:35.146
if that's what you're trying to say.

33:36.954 --> 33:38.244
Then where did you go?

33:38.878 --> 33:42.494
I don't remember.
Um, back out on the dance floor.

33:42.956 --> 33:44.426
Candice, you're lying.

33:45.870 --> 33:47.451
I know about the video,

33:48.119 --> 33:49.739
the one with you and Beau.

33:51.322 --> 33:52.937
Please don't tell my father.

33:53.183 --> 33:55.051
I'm gonna do my best not to.

33:56.287 --> 33:58.468
I need you to meet me halfway, though.

33:59.598 --> 34:01.394
Beau was blackmailing you, wasn't he?

34:01.395 --> 34:02.817
That's why you were there last night

34:02.818 --> 34:04.521
and that's why you killed him.

34:05.123 --> 34:06.807
No, you-- you don't understand.

34:06.808 --> 34:08.010
I think I do.

34:08.239 --> 34:09.931
You're a kindergarten teacher.

34:10.009 --> 34:12.020
You knew that that video
would cost you your job

34:12.021 --> 34:13.039
and your reputation,

34:13.040 --> 34:14.684
not to mention your dad's reputation,

34:14.685 --> 34:16.117
and you lost control.

34:16.118 --> 34:18.187
Any jury's gonna sympathize with you.

34:18.188 --> 34:19.937
And I can put in a good word with the D.A.

34:19.938 --> 34:23.929
I just need you to tell
me exactly what happened.

34:27.370 --> 34:29.774
Um, I-I'd like to speak to my attorney.

34:32.413 --> 34:34.004
The judge granted us the warrant.

34:34.005 --> 34:35.280
The boys are on their way to Candice's

34:35.281 --> 34:36.616
to see if they can find proof

34:36.617 --> 34:38.985
that Beau was blackmailing her.

34:39.815 --> 34:41.021
It's hard, isn't it,

34:41.022 --> 34:43.643
when the killer turns out to be a
better person than the victim?

34:43.643 --> 34:45.094
Where's my daughter?

34:47.004 --> 34:49.202
My attorney says you're holding her.

34:52.186 --> 34:53.270
I want to talk to my daughter.

34:53.271 --> 34:54.837
Mr. Armstrong, you should know that Candice

34:54.838 --> 34:57.300
is a person of interest in
the Beau Randolph case.

34:57.301 --> 35:00.095
What?
Don't be ridiculous.

35:00.096 --> 35:02.452
We should talk about this privately.

35:03.016 --> 35:04.064
Go ahead.

35:06.280 --> 35:08.610
This is all some kind of hideous mistake.

35:09.571 --> 35:11.272
Candice wouldn't hurt anyone.

35:11.273 --> 35:14.061
Were you aware of any...

35:14.363 --> 35:16.282
connection between her and Beau?

35:16.283 --> 35:17.787
A connection with Beau Randolph?

35:17.788 --> 35:18.752
Are you joking?

35:18.753 --> 35:20.074
And by the way, my Candice

35:20.075 --> 35:21.972
would never be caught dead in that club.

35:21.973 --> 35:23.509
Actually, it was Beau that was caught dead.

35:23.510 --> 35:26.339
And Candice was in that club.

35:39.263 --> 35:41.418
What on earth was she doing in this place?

35:42.043 --> 35:44.477
Maybe she was trying to
protect herself from Beau.

35:45.350 --> 35:46.740
Or protect you.

35:51.988 --> 35:54.594
I made my feelings about him very plain.

35:54.678 --> 35:56.964
My goal was simply to stop his activities.

35:56.965 --> 35:59.430
I never intended for him to get hurt.

36:00.138 --> 36:02.002
Do you think that my, uh...

36:04.337 --> 36:06.864
my words, my--my mission...

36:07.401 --> 36:10.271
could have led Candice to
do something terrible?

36:13.485 --> 36:14.975
Is that possible?

36:18.120 --> 36:20.412
If I were in Candice's shoes, I
would've done the same thing.

36:20.413 --> 36:23.231
Well, I mean, I feel for her, I do.

36:23.232 --> 36:24.928
But she knew what she was getting into.

36:24.929 --> 36:27.657
She knew Beau would blackmail
her, so this is her fault?

36:27.658 --> 36:28.681
With what her dad did,

36:28.682 --> 36:29.993
she must have known who Beau was

36:29.994 --> 36:31.640
and what he was about.

36:31.740 --> 36:33.354
It's not like it was with Scarlet.

36:33.355 --> 36:35.745
Oh, I see. So this is about you.
Okay.

36:35.746 --> 36:38.523
Hey, that chick totally
misrepresented herself, bro.

36:38.630 --> 36:39.927
She was hot, though, right?

36:39.928 --> 36:41.807
Here's the sad thing-- for you,

36:41.808 --> 36:44.256
the fact that she misrepresented herself

36:44.257 --> 36:45.176
makes her even hotter.

36:45.177 --> 36:47.949
No, she can't be any hotter
than she already is.

36:50.025 --> 36:51.049
Oh, check this out.

36:51.050 --> 36:53.282
Hmm?
It is an e-mail to Candice

36:53.283 --> 36:55.690
from Beau with an attachment.

36:55.691 --> 36:57.206
Probably the terms of the blackmail.

36:57.207 --> 36:58.482
What did Beau want in exchange

36:58.483 --> 36:59.850
for keeping a lid on that sex tape?

36:59.851 --> 37:02.221
No, no, no.
This is some kind of trust,

37:02.222 --> 37:05.247
set up by Beau for $5 million.

37:05.248 --> 37:06.633
Well, that makes no sense.

37:06.634 --> 37:07.794
If he was blackmailing her,

37:07.795 --> 37:08.925
why would he be giving her money?

37:08.926 --> 37:10.016
The trust isn't for Candice.

37:10.017 --> 37:12.446
The beneficiary is listed
as a "J.D. Mayfield."

37:12.789 --> 37:14.854
I didn't find a J.D. Mayfield
in her family.

37:14.855 --> 37:17.739
Could be a John Doe or a Jane Doe.

37:17.956 --> 37:18.951
Yo, check this out.

37:18.952 --> 37:20.325
In Candice's date book,

37:20.326 --> 37:22.881
it's an ultrasound dated
just a few days ago,

37:23.578 --> 37:26.081
and the patient is listed as a
"C. Mayfield."

37:26.271 --> 37:27.983
So Candice is pregnant.

37:27.984 --> 37:30.106
And Beau set up the trust for her baby,

37:30.107 --> 37:31.898
and why would he do that?

37:31.899 --> 37:33.540
Because it's his kid.

37:41.269 --> 37:42.836
I met Beau at a bar.

37:42.837 --> 37:44.772
I thought he was funny and cute.

37:44.773 --> 37:46.548
I had no idea who he was.

37:46.549 --> 37:48.610
I'm pretty sure he didn't
know who I was, either.

37:48.611 --> 37:50.063
Star-crossed lovers,

37:50.064 --> 37:52.033
just like Romeo and Juliet.

37:52.099 --> 37:53.842
If Romeo and Juliet had gotten drunk

37:53.843 --> 37:55.961
and had a meaningless one-night stand.

37:56.948 --> 37:58.079
Point taken.

37:58.340 --> 37:59.840
When I found out I was pregnant,

37:59.841 --> 38:02.266
I knew letting him know was
the right thing to do.

38:02.267 --> 38:04.079
I mean, I figured he wouldn't care,

38:04.080 --> 38:05.446
that he would tell me I was on my own.

38:05.447 --> 38:07.340
And I would've been fine with that.

38:08.217 --> 38:10.575
But when I showed him
that first ultrasound,

38:10.809 --> 38:12.287
he got so choked up.

38:12.288 --> 38:13.338
When was this?

38:13.621 --> 38:15.181
About two months ago.

38:15.281 --> 38:16.781
That's when he broke it off with Tiffany

38:16.782 --> 38:19.500
and when he got interested
in Little Frog Enterprises.

38:19.685 --> 38:21.494
He was cleaning up his act, going legit.

38:21.495 --> 38:22.744
Pretty much.

38:22.745 --> 38:24.412
I thought it was all an act.

38:24.413 --> 38:26.273
But he called all the time.

38:26.572 --> 38:29.198
He said he really wanted to be
a part of the child's life.

38:29.199 --> 38:31.376
But you knew your father would disapprove.

38:32.961 --> 38:35.571
My father disapproves about most things.

38:35.978 --> 38:37.215
It was me.

38:37.256 --> 38:39.172
I was the one that didn't want Beau around.

38:39.173 --> 38:40.489
I mean, not with his reputation.

38:40.490 --> 38:42.291
I didn't want that for my baby.

38:42.967 --> 38:44.384
Beau wouldn't give up.

38:44.385 --> 38:45.967
You know, he told me that

38:46.035 --> 38:47.962
all his life, he'd been searching,

38:48.119 --> 38:50.077
and he was looking for meaning in his life,

38:50.078 --> 38:51.879
and that he'd finally found it.

38:52.730 --> 38:54.073
It was being a father.

38:54.474 --> 38:56.171
He kept telling me that
he would convince me,

38:56.172 --> 38:58.289
that he could change.

38:58.730 --> 39:00.213
Why'd you go to the club that night?

39:00.214 --> 39:01.924
Beau asked me to meet him there.

39:02.258 --> 39:04.346
He wanted to tell me that he was
shutting down his business.

39:04.347 --> 39:05.317
He was selling it?

39:05.318 --> 39:07.366
No, he was shutting it down for good.

39:07.367 --> 39:09.484
He said he knew that was the
only way to convince me.

39:09.485 --> 39:12.753
So the DVDs, the web site,
it was all going away.

39:12.953 --> 39:16.101
Did he tell anyone else that he
planned on shutting it down?

39:16.102 --> 39:17.561
Yes, he did.

39:17.946 --> 39:19.513
That night, in fact.

39:21.396 --> 39:23.255
Okay, okay, all right, girls.
You ready?

39:23.256 --> 39:24.423
We're gonna take a little bit of tape

39:24.424 --> 39:25.370
right up here while the crew sets up.

39:25.371 --> 39:27.019
Come on.
Up, up, up.

39:29.726 --> 39:32.083
Well, the show must go on, right, Troy?

39:32.328 --> 39:34.146
Can't let a little thing
like the death of your boss

39:34.147 --> 39:35.305
get in the way of a party.

39:35.306 --> 39:37.255
Look, I miss Beau.
He was a good friend.

39:37.256 --> 39:38.816
But this is a business.

39:38.817 --> 39:41.010
Okay, we have videos to
produce, distribution deals.

39:41.011 --> 39:42.654
This doesn't just end.

39:43.637 --> 39:46.649
Okay, look, I honor his memory
by keeping the party going.

39:46.650 --> 39:47.783
Oh, that's nice.

39:47.784 --> 39:51.478
Except if you really wanted
to honor his memory,

39:51.479 --> 39:54.063
you would shut down the entire operation.

39:54.571 --> 39:55.662
Shut it down?

39:55.663 --> 39:56.766
We know that Beau told you

39:56.767 --> 39:58.604
he was folding the company for good.

39:59.623 --> 40:00.879
That's crazy.

40:00.897 --> 40:02.356
Yeah, and you probably thought so, too.

40:02.357 --> 40:04.458
That's why you decided that
you couldn't let it happen.

40:04.459 --> 40:05.489
What are you talking about?

40:05.490 --> 40:07.325
When we found out you had motive,

40:07.326 --> 40:08.586
we took a look at your footage.

40:08.587 --> 40:10.463
Yeah, and you saw that I
was filming all night,

40:10.464 --> 40:12.196
including while Beau was being killed.

40:12.197 --> 40:14.514
Actually, your camera was filming,

40:14.515 --> 40:15.839
but you weren't.

40:15.840 --> 40:18.135
Normally the footage
from a hand-held camera

40:18.136 --> 40:19.251
would be in motion.

40:19.252 --> 40:20.402
And yours was in motion,

40:20.403 --> 40:23.356
except for from 11:50 to 11:58--

40:23.357 --> 40:25.200
About the time Beau headed to the bathroom.

40:25.201 --> 40:26.707
For those eight minutes,

40:26.759 --> 40:28.394
the footage was rock-steady.

40:28.395 --> 40:29.324
You put your camera on a tripod

40:29.325 --> 40:30.672
and you walked away.

40:34.120 --> 40:35.112
You left it running,

40:35.113 --> 40:37.231
knowing that that would give you an alibi.

40:40.017 --> 40:41.259
I mean, yeah, I used a tripod,

40:41.260 --> 40:42.817
but that doesn't prove I killed him.

40:42.818 --> 40:46.293
No, but the D.N.A.
on the murder weapon will.

40:47.172 --> 40:48.257
D.N.A.?

40:48.537 --> 40:51.032
We got a court order to
test it against yours.

40:52.483 --> 40:53.927
Party's over, Troy.

40:57.928 --> 41:01.096
He promised me I would take
over the business someday,

41:01.405 --> 41:02.838
promised he'd get me rich,

41:02.839 --> 41:04.962
and then he just decides to end it all,

41:04.963 --> 41:06.639
decides to screw me over

41:06.640 --> 41:09.322
because of, uh, what, some baby?

41:10.390 --> 41:11.607
Come on.

41:13.207 --> 41:15.198
How can you give up all this?

41:17.107 --> 41:18.674
You're about to find out.

41:18.875 --> 41:19.891
Cuff him.

41:24.461 --> 41:25.638
Turn around.

41:30.346 --> 41:32.256
So that's why Beau was killed,

41:32.506 --> 41:33.754
over money?

41:34.248 --> 41:35.796
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

41:35.797 --> 41:38.951
But you should know that what
he told you was the truth.

41:38.952 --> 41:40.930
He really was trying to be a better man.

41:40.931 --> 41:43.680
I'm just sad that our baby
will never get to meet him.

41:43.681 --> 41:46.421
But one day, I'll tell her his story--

41:46.739 --> 41:49.089
how Beau gave his life to be her father.

41:49.449 --> 41:50.845
So you're having a daughter, then?

41:50.846 --> 41:52.112
Yeah.

41:52.791 --> 41:54.489
That's wonderful.
Congratulations.

41:54.490 --> 41:55.581
Thank you.

41:56.357 --> 41:58.193
I think your dad's here to see you.

42:00.686 --> 42:02.802
I guess I should tell him what's going on.

42:04.152 --> 42:05.194
Thank you

42:05.195 --> 42:06.818
for finding out the truth.

42:12.170 --> 42:14.519
You think he'll be able
to accept his grandchild?

42:15.477 --> 42:16.811
Absolutely.

42:21.185 --> 42:22.752
What makes you sure?

42:23.293 --> 42:25.841
Because a father would do
anything for his daughter.
