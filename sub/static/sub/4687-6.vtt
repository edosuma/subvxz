Eternal Father

01:27.796 --> 01:30.256
<i>Strong to save</i>

01:30.340 --> 01:36.304
<i>Whose arm doth bind the restless wave</i>

01:36.388 --> 01:42.477
<i>Who bidd'st the mighty ocean deep</i>

01:42.561 --> 01:48.733
<i>Its own appointed limits keep</i>

01:48.817 --> 01:54.864
<i>O, hear us when we cry to Thee</i>

01:54.948 --> 02:00.828
<i>For those in peril on the sea</i>

02:00.913 --> 02:07.084
<i>O Savior whose almighty word</i>

02:07.169 --> 02:13.049
<i>The winds and waves submissive heard...</i>

02:14.760 --> 02:17.845
Yes, I definitely understood you.

02:17.930 --> 02:20.223
I'm at a funeral service. Thank you.

02:21.433 --> 02:25.937
No, I called you. I just meant that that's why...
That's why my voice sounds like this.

02:26.021 --> 02:28.731
That's why I'm being quiet.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.525
Yes, sir. Yes, Catherine.
I'm sorry.

02:33.570 --> 02:34.570
Okay.

02:38.367 --> 02:41.661
O sacred spirit

02:41.745 --> 02:43.079
<i>Who did brood...</i>

02:44.289 --> 02:50.378
<i>And gave his light and life and peace</i>

02:50.462 --> 02:56.467
<i>O hear us when we cry to Thee...</i>

02:57.261 --> 02:58.344
I need to talk to you.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.012
Everything all right?

03:01.098 --> 03:03.432
Remember the night
before you went to prison?

03:05.477 --> 03:07.520
The power was out in the apartment.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.105
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

03:12.276 --> 03:13.734
What?

03:16.905 --> 03:18.030
-What?
-You heard me.

03:18.115 --> 03:20.533
No, I didn't. Your mouth was moving,
but you didn't make sounds.

03:20.617 --> 03:24.537
That was my doctor on the phone
with the results of a blood test.

03:30.335 --> 03:34.380
Ellen!

03:35.299 --> 03:36.299
He means you.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.551
Excuse me, sir. Do you mean me?

03:38.635 --> 03:40.553
Who the hell do I mean when I say your name?

03:40.637 --> 03:42.346
I'm Maggie. Margaret. Maggie's fine.

03:42.431 --> 03:44.223
I need Ellen.

03:44.308 --> 03:47.476
Does anyone know someone named...

03:48.395 --> 03:50.229
I don't think there's anyone here named Ellen.

03:50.314 --> 03:52.356
I can't keep track. Karen I think her name is.

03:52.441 --> 03:54.400
I don't think there's anyone
named Karen here either.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.360
My assistant. She sits right over there.

03:56.445 --> 03:58.362
I'm your assistant now.
You promoted me last week.

03:58.447 --> 03:59.614
I have no memory of that.

03:59.698 --> 04:02.116
You fired Ellen and then forgot that you did
and thought I was Ellen.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.784
-Is this tie all right?
-It's very sharp, sir.

04:04.286 --> 04:06.370
I'm not your platoon leader.
Please don't call me sir.

04:06.455 --> 04:08.039
-Do you have good taste?
-In what?

04:08.123 --> 04:10.750
Clothes. Do people generally say
you have good taste?

04:10.834 --> 04:12.627
-Pretty good.
-Okay, don't take this the wrong way,

04:12.711 --> 04:14.712
but what you're wearing right now,
is that because you like it

04:14.796 --> 04:16.255
or is it because that's all you can afford?

04:16.340 --> 04:18.758
A little of both, I guess. There was a sale at...

04:18.842 --> 04:21.427
Get me some more ties and someone
who knows what they're talking about.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.012
Sure.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.059
Don, the storm is now causing
record flooding in New England.

04:28.143 --> 04:30.144
-We'll drop that into the copy.
-And clear out the block.

04:30.228 --> 04:32.021
- The whole block?
- Yeah.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.607
-That means throwing out Moscow.
-Remind me.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.443
A pair of suicide bombers
attacked two subway stations.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.779
Thirty-eight dead. Officials think
it was Chechen rebels fighting...

04:39.863 --> 04:43.115
Record flooding, FEMA's saying 200,000
people in Rhode Island could be affected.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.117
Yeah, it's raining in Providence.
Everyone's gonna be okay.

04:45.202 --> 04:47.870
-You really want the whole block?
-Yes.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.622
Sixty seconds.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.463
They just called 60.
You need to clear the studio.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.423
You asked to see me.

04:59.508 --> 05:01.300
-Sorry, tell me your name again.
-Neal Sampat.

05:01.385 --> 05:03.010
Neal, I need the guy who edits our website.

05:03.679 --> 05:05.638
-That's me.
-All right.

05:05.722 --> 05:08.474
It's been several days
since I asked Don Keefer

05:08.558 --> 05:12.520
to have the website do a poll on Obamacare
so I could do a segment on the poll.

05:12.604 --> 05:14.438
Yeah, Don spoke to me about that

05:14.523 --> 05:16.732
and I wasn't sure what kind of poll question
you were looking for.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.192
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:18.276 --> 05:19.986
Do you favor Obamacare?

05:20.612 --> 05:23.072
-Are you sure that's a good idea?
-What's the problem?

05:23.657 --> 05:25.700
For one thing, it hasn't been implemented yet.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.368
I know that.

05:27.452 --> 05:29.662
It's just that polling is a science
and this wouldn't be a proper...

05:29.746 --> 05:31.163
What are you talking about?

05:31.248 --> 05:33.040
If you want to spend the money on polling...

05:33.125 --> 05:35.001
Just ask the question,
give the answer to graphics.

05:35.085 --> 05:37.837
They'll put it up on the screen,
I'll talk about it with a guest.

05:37.921 --> 05:39.964
I'm just trying to protect
the integrity of the website.

05:40.048 --> 05:43.134
It's a website. It doesn't have integrity.
You need to clear the studio.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.512
- 10 seconds.
- Yeah.

05:51.518 --> 05:55.312
<i>In three, two, one. Roll in.</i>

06:06.450 --> 06:10.453
Good evening. I'm Will McAvoy.
This is News Night for April 2nd, 2010.

06:10.829 --> 06:13.706
We've got a great show tonight.
You're gonna be happy you landed here.

06:14.124 --> 06:17.668
<i>Record flooding across New England</i>
<i>with Rhode Island hit the hardest.</i>

06:17.753 --> 06:19.879
<i>We're gonna put you</i>
<i>right in the eye of the storm.</i>

06:19.963 --> 06:21.547
<i>Three men have been arrested in conjunction</i>

06:21.631 --> 06:23.591
<i>with the New York subway stabbings</i>
<i>last weekend.</i>

06:23.675 --> 06:27.386
<i>And we'll be talking to Kiefer Sutherland</i>
<i>about the last season of 24.</i>

06:27.471 --> 06:30.056
<i>You won't want to miss it.</i>
<i>All that coming up after this.</i>

06:30.140 --> 06:33.309
You're watching News Night on ACN.
So stick around.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.897
Clear.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.262
-Name that tune.
-Play a little more.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.559
Tom T. Hall. That's How I Got to Memphis.

07:15.644 --> 07:17.770
You do play a little guitar on the side.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.939
I do a little news anchoring on the side.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.440
Since when do you listen to country?

07:21.525 --> 07:24.652
My grandson Bo, Katie's oldest,
has a garage band.

07:24.736 --> 07:26.779
Ask me what instrument he plays.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.823
- Guitar.
- All of them.

07:28.907 --> 07:30.699
Seriously, he's a savant.

07:30.784 --> 07:34.286
You put an instrument in his hands,
give him a day, and he can play it.

07:34.371 --> 07:39.083
So I was at their house last weekend
and I wander out to the garage

07:39.167 --> 07:42.294
and see Bo teaching
That's How I Got to Memphis to his friends.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.922
And I ask him,
"What's a kid from New Rochelle doing

07:45.006 --> 07:46.799
"singing about Memphis?"

07:46.883 --> 07:51.762
He said, "Memphis is a stand-in
for wherever you are right now.

07:51.847 --> 07:53.931
"That it really means that's how I got here."

07:55.767 --> 07:57.518
-Will.
-Yeah?

07:59.604 --> 08:04.066
You did a five-minute-and-20-second block
on the weather tonight.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.693
Weather rates.

08:05.777 --> 08:09.446
-I saw you're speaking at Northwestern.
-Yeah.

08:09.531 --> 08:12.074
-To journalism students.
-Yeah.

08:12.784 --> 08:15.870
Are you going to tell the kids
that weather rates?

08:15.954 --> 08:17.663
-What do you want from me?
-The news.

08:17.747 --> 08:20.541
I've got the second highest rated
newscast on cable.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.168
I don't give a shit.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.837
I know that, Charlie. That's why I have to.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.341
Have you ever thought about having kids?

08:29.426 --> 08:30.843
You mean adopting?

08:31.178 --> 08:32.511
Adopting, abducting.

08:32.596 --> 08:35.347
Meeting somebody, getting married.
Whatever it takes.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.516
I haven't considered abducting anyone,

08:37.601 --> 08:39.685
-but I've thought about the others.
-And?

08:39.769 --> 08:43.355
Well, first of all, I'm now in my 50s
and I need to consider that I'm gonna die

08:43.440 --> 08:45.733
and will my kid be old enough
to handle it when I do.

08:45.817 --> 08:48.986
There's no age at which
you're okay with your father dying.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.863
But there's a difference
between being an adult

08:50.947 --> 08:52.907
and dropping a piano on a kid.

08:52.991 --> 08:56.160
You don't look to me
like you're gonna die anytime soon.

08:56.244 --> 09:00.915
And if you got hit by an ice-cream truck,
they'd still have you as a father for a while.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.750
Yeah, I'm not sure that's a prize.

09:02.834 --> 09:04.376
Why?

09:04.461 --> 09:05.878
I've read plenty of experts who say that

09:05.962 --> 09:10.216
whatever undiagnosed shit my father has
can be hereditary.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.384
Your father's an alcoholic, you're not.

09:12.469 --> 09:14.053
I'm talking about...

09:14.137 --> 09:17.056
He's obviously lived his life
with some kind of severe depression.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.892
Your depression isn't chemical.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.894
-Who says I'm depressed?
-I do.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.438
Will, you're so much better
than the show you're doing.

09:24.522 --> 09:26.232
I'm tired of this. It's the second highest...

09:26.316 --> 09:29.568
Highest rated hour of congratulations.

09:29.653 --> 09:32.154
Palm Sunday mass in St. Peter's Square,

09:32.697 --> 09:36.533
Benedict tells tens of thousands of people
as well as the rest of the world

09:36.618 --> 09:38.494
about the recent petty gossip...

09:38.578 --> 09:40.621
His words... That he's been subjected to.

09:40.705 --> 09:43.916
That he's been subjected to. Petty gossip.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.712
He's talking about proven allegations
that priests have been raping children

09:48.797 --> 09:51.674
and that bishops, archbishops, cardinals,

09:51.758 --> 09:55.761
and maybe even this pope
have been protecting the children?

09:55.845 --> 09:58.681
No, the priests.

09:59.182 --> 10:02.559
Benedict fails to mention that in his sermon,
which is bad enough,

10:02.644 --> 10:06.855
but you failed to mention that
in your report Monday.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.816
And that's inexplicable to me.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.359
Bill Donohue...

10:10.443 --> 10:12.778
Yeah, you don't want
the Catholic League mad at you.

10:12.862 --> 10:13.946
Nobody does.

10:14.030 --> 10:18.617
The President in his first visit to Afghanistan
as the president meets with Hamid Karzai.

10:18.702 --> 10:21.996
And then I couldn't believe the words
that came out of your mouth next.

10:22.080 --> 10:26.500
"We'll have two top campaign strategists
here in the studio

10:26.584 --> 10:28.127
"to debate the war right after this."

10:28.211 --> 10:29.461
They were good guests.

10:29.546 --> 10:34.466
What in the hell are we doing
having two campaign hacks

10:34.551 --> 10:39.471
from the DCCC and the RNC on our air
debating America's longest war

10:39.556 --> 10:41.682
when you know as well as I know

10:41.766 --> 10:45.060
that they know exactly as much as
what's printed in their talking points?

10:45.145 --> 10:46.562
Who would you have preferred?

10:46.646 --> 10:50.858
Anybody from AEI, Brookings, Heritage, Cato.

10:50.942 --> 10:53.402
Anybody from State or Defense.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.488
Anybody from House
or Senate Foreign Relations.

10:56.573 --> 11:00.159
At the very least you could get
the guy who wrote the talking points.

11:00.243 --> 11:03.495
-There's a midterm election coming up.
-In six months.

11:05.582 --> 11:09.043
So why do you book
a red guy and a blue guy?

11:11.921 --> 11:13.422
For the fight.

11:14.966 --> 11:17.760
I'm starting to enjoy our post-show drinks
less and less.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.056
-I'll back off.
-Thank you.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.475
-For tonight.
-I'll take what I can get.

11:25.060 --> 11:26.435
And remember what I said.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.187
You said a lot of things.

11:28.938 --> 11:32.274
Being a father. It lives up to the hype.

11:35.278 --> 11:41.367
Amen

11:48.875 --> 11:50.709
Hey!

11:50.794 --> 11:52.669
Yeah. Sorry.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.467
Amazing service.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.302
Thank you. Thank you.

12:03.515 --> 12:06.600
Okay, please help me. I need to fully
understand what's happening right now.

12:06.684 --> 12:10.396
I'm seven weeks pregnant and there's like
a five in nine chance that it's yours.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.564
I don't care if there's no chance it's mine.
It's mine now.

12:12.649 --> 12:14.149
-Couple of questions.
-Give them to me.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.651
Are you feeling all right?
Should you be standing up?

12:15.735 --> 12:17.027
Is it all right for you to be outdoors?

12:17.112 --> 12:19.780
I feel great and I'm allowed to be outdoors
for the first eight weeks.

12:19.864 --> 12:22.282
-Feels like that was a joke, but I can't tell.
-It was.

12:22.367 --> 12:25.744
Moratorium on jokes for the next week
and seven months. Have you had an amnio?

12:27.664 --> 12:29.915
In between getting off the phone
and talking to you?

12:29.999 --> 12:32.418
No, I was going to use the amnio room
in the chapel,

12:32.502 --> 12:34.044
but they were out of really long needles.

12:34.504 --> 12:36.046
What rule did I just make about jokes?

12:36.131 --> 12:38.090
I don't think you're gonna be
making rules for a while.

12:38.174 --> 12:41.552
Amnio's at 16 weeks.
We do a blood test for Down's at 10 weeks.

12:41.636 --> 12:43.429
-Down's?
-Yeah, there are some scary parts.

12:43.513 --> 12:48.058
But, Billy, my hCG levels were 220,000,
which is good. It's a strong pregnancy.

12:48.143 --> 12:50.102
-220,000 is good?
-It's very good.

12:50.186 --> 12:53.147
-Is there such a thing as 221,000?
-This is gonna be a long seven months.

12:53.231 --> 12:54.815
-No, it's gonna be great. You know why?
-Don't say it.

12:54.899 --> 12:56.692
I'm gonna be in charge of morale.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.444
-Do we know if it's a boy or a girl?
-Yep.

12:58.528 --> 13:00.821
There's a good chance
it's gonna be one of those two.

13:06.411 --> 13:08.036
I know.

13:08.705 --> 13:11.039
I can't believe he's not here for this.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.960
- It was a nice service.
- It was.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.920
Yeah. I thought
you were gonna do the eulogy.

13:17.005 --> 13:20.132
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I was. I asked his brother to do it.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.468
Okay.

13:22.552 --> 13:25.012
Mac, take a ride with me
to the cemetery, will you?

13:25.096 --> 13:26.096
Sure.

13:26.181 --> 13:28.891
-Mac, Mac, Mac.
-Yes?

13:29.726 --> 13:32.019
I think maybe we should just put you
in a hospital bed right now

13:32.103 --> 13:33.479
and hook you up to an epidural.

13:33.563 --> 13:34.813
-Would that be premature?
-Yes.

13:34.898 --> 13:36.190
Okay.

13:41.988 --> 13:44.031
-We're gonna ride with you.
-We?

13:45.492 --> 13:46.742
Hi.

13:48.119 --> 13:49.703
Sure.

14:24.906 --> 14:27.157
That was a nice service.

14:27.242 --> 14:30.077
Episcopalians know what they're doing.

14:30.161 --> 14:32.204
I thought Will was gonna
give the eulogy, but...

14:32.288 --> 14:33.789
-Pipe down a second.
-Okay.

14:36.125 --> 14:41.380
Terry Smith wants me to come down
and interview for a field producer job in DC.

14:43.258 --> 14:46.343
A field producer job in DC.

14:47.679 --> 14:48.679
I know.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.305
How do you know?

14:51.057 --> 14:52.724
I'm the one who recommended you.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.227
-When?
-Yesterday.

14:56.145 --> 14:58.272
She called and said,
"Who's ready for a promotion?

14:58.356 --> 14:59.898
"Who's the best you've got?"

14:59.983 --> 15:03.694
I said Gary. Then Tess.
Kendra, Tamara, then Martin.

15:04.279 --> 15:06.780
And then I said, "But Maggie Jordan
is the sixth best we've got.

15:06.864 --> 15:09.950
"You couldn't do any better than Maggie
unless you went with one of the other five."

15:11.369 --> 15:12.369
I'm kidding.

15:12.996 --> 15:14.496
I said, "You've got to take Maggie."

15:15.999 --> 15:20.002
Well, I have to go down
to DC tomorrow to interview.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.921
You're gonna get it.

15:37.103 --> 15:40.272
-You've got a problem, my friend.
-I know.

15:40.356 --> 15:43.275
"Lucas Pruit thinks
women are worth less than men."

15:43.359 --> 15:45.193
That's a bullshit headline.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.195
You own a company called Kwench.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.365
-Yeah.
-K-W-E-N-C-H.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.701
You know that's not
how you spell that word, right?

15:52.785 --> 15:55.829
Kwench makes personalized soft drinks.
It's a personalized word.

15:55.913 --> 15:58.540
I hardly understood that sentence at all.
Did you?

15:58.833 --> 15:59.916
- Me?
- Yeah.

16:00.001 --> 16:01.126
I don't know what I'm doing here.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.587
Valleywag is reporting pay inequity
at Kwench.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.297
How do you know
we're underpaying the women?

16:05.381 --> 16:07.132
How do you know
we're not overpaying the men?

16:07.508 --> 16:09.509
That is definitely the argument I'd use.

16:09.594 --> 16:12.721
Seventy-seven cents on the dollar
isn't a job-to-job figure.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.974
It's a specious statistic.
Women leave the workforce at different times.

16:16.059 --> 16:17.934
They also don't negotiate as hard.

16:18.019 --> 16:19.853
I'm supposed to volunteer extra money

16:19.937 --> 16:22.105
because I'm playing baseball
and they're playing T-ball?

16:22.440 --> 16:25.025
When you control for literally everything,

16:25.109 --> 16:28.654
single versus married, whether or not they
have kids, the pay gap doesn't go away.

16:29.072 --> 16:31.990
And most people don't have jobs
where they negotiate their salary.

16:34.285 --> 16:36.161
I still don't know what I'm doing here

16:36.245 --> 16:39.665
-or what a personalized soft drink is.
-It's a millennial...

16:39.749 --> 16:43.001
You know, the pay gap problem
would probably go away

16:43.086 --> 16:45.253
if it weren't for punch two
of the one-two punch.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.338
Such bullshit, Leona.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.840
Two days ago
the story from Valleywag comes out

16:48.925 --> 16:50.884
saying you pay women at Kwench
less than men.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.219
--And then yesterday

16:52.303 --> 16:54.054
a story in The New York Observer says

16:54.138 --> 16:57.474
you hired hookers
for your 35th birthday party.

16:57.558 --> 17:00.102
It didn't say that.
It said I hired models for my party.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.479
-Hmm. Any of the models men?
-No.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.649
So you hired young women
to be guests at your party.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.275
-It's not uncommon.
-It's not?

17:07.694 --> 17:09.319
Were these women given dress codes?

17:09.404 --> 17:11.029
The whole party had a dress code.

17:11.114 --> 17:12.823
The invitation said suggested dress.

17:12.907 --> 17:14.032
You got hold of an invitation?

17:14.117 --> 17:17.452
So was the dress code
for these young women suggested

17:17.537 --> 17:20.038
-or was it mandatory?
-The women weren't hired for sex.

17:20.123 --> 17:21.998
I don't expect you to understand this.

17:22.083 --> 17:24.292
They were hired to be living art.

17:25.336 --> 17:28.839
First of all, you shouldn't expect
anyone to understand that.

17:28.923 --> 17:32.259
Second, you need to know that
every time you try to explain it,

17:32.343 --> 17:34.302
you just make it worse.

17:35.471 --> 17:36.972
So I'm gonna help you today.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.059
-You are?
-Yeah.

17:42.478 --> 17:46.314
-Is it like a can of cola with your initials on it?
-No.

17:51.112 --> 17:52.529
Um...

17:53.239 --> 17:56.074
We think you need to know
exactly what happened.

17:56.159 --> 17:57.325
Mmm-hmm.

17:59.454 --> 18:01.621
Things were bad while you were in jail.

18:02.290 --> 18:05.250
Pruit was implementing
his vision for the network

18:05.334 --> 18:07.627
and Charlie had kind of thrown in the towel.

18:07.712 --> 18:09.588
Thrown in the towel isn't right. That's not fair.

18:09.672 --> 18:11.798
He'd, you know, given up.

18:11.883 --> 18:13.759
-That's what throwing in the towel means.
-It doesn't matter.

18:14.177 --> 18:18.930
We... Don, Mac, and myself, but mostly Don,
had been fighting with Charlie a lot.

18:19.015 --> 18:21.266
On Monday night
I did an interview with this guy Bree,

18:21.350 --> 18:23.977
who had been hired by Pruit
to run ACN Digital while Neal's gone.

18:24.061 --> 18:26.605
Bree is a dick.

18:26.689 --> 18:29.858
-Yeah, the website is an abomination.
-It is, yes, an abomination.

18:30.401 --> 18:32.277
One part of it in particular, in fact.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.029
An app that assists violent criminals.

18:34.489 --> 18:36.615
And Monday night
I interviewed Bree about the app.

18:36.699 --> 18:39.785
Pruit was happy about this interview because
it would draw attention to the website

18:39.869 --> 18:42.204
and Charlie was happy about it
because Pruit was happy about it.

18:42.997 --> 18:45.540
But in the interview itself,
I ripped the app apart

18:45.625 --> 18:47.584
and Bree and the network along with it

18:47.668 --> 18:51.630
and in a manner that made Charlie angrier
than I'd ever seen him in...

18:54.050 --> 18:55.926
Ever, really.

18:59.722 --> 19:02.265
And it was a few minutes later
that he had a heart attack.

19:06.270 --> 19:09.064
But there's another part of the story
that Don's going to tell you about

19:09.148 --> 19:10.899
that strongly suggests it was him and not me

19:10.983 --> 19:14.069
that precipitated the death
of our very close friend and leader.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.695
Do you want to hear Don tell you
that part of the story?

19:16.823 --> 19:17.906
Yes, I do.

19:21.369 --> 19:22.369
Okay.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.795
Excuse me, are you MacKenzie McHale?

19:33.214 --> 19:35.173
You are. I recognize you.

19:35.258 --> 19:38.176
-I'm Charlie Skinner.
-Sure, I know.

19:38.970 --> 19:41.847
I called your office,
but you don't work there anymore.

19:42.390 --> 19:44.975
I was able to get in touch
with your friend Jim Harper

19:45.059 --> 19:48.270
and he told me that at 11:00 a.m. on a Monday

19:48.354 --> 19:50.897
I could find you
at the Lucky Strike bowling lanes.

19:54.110 --> 19:59.114
Then he said, "Yeah, you heard me right."
And that was pretty much it.

20:02.118 --> 20:03.827
You're serious about bowling?

20:04.745 --> 20:06.496
I just took it up recently.

20:06.956 --> 20:10.250
I bowled a strike once when I was a little girl
and it seems to me if you can do it once,

20:10.334 --> 20:12.419
then you should be able to do it
12 times in a row,

20:12.503 --> 20:14.045
which would be a perfect game.

20:14.130 --> 20:16.506
So that's what I'm trying to do.

20:17.466 --> 20:18.842
I don't want to stop you. Go ahead.

20:37.987 --> 20:40.196
-I hooked it.
-A little bit.

20:42.033 --> 20:43.700
You like to drink in the middle of the day?

20:44.827 --> 20:46.661
I'm still on Afghanistan time,

20:46.746 --> 20:49.372
I'm unemployed,
and I'm in sweatpants at a bowling alley.

20:49.624 --> 20:52.751
I heard you had some trouble in Fallujah.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.085
That was a long time ago.

20:54.670 --> 20:55.670
Five months.

20:57.173 --> 21:00.926
I got stabbed in the abdomen.

21:02.053 --> 21:04.220
They sewed me up.
The budget cuts hurt worse.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.182
You're expensive.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.225
You may have priced yourself
out of your own career.

21:09.310 --> 21:11.728
I offered to cut my salary 35%.

21:11.812 --> 21:13.939
I'm not what's expensive
about foreign coverage.

21:14.023 --> 21:16.232
Have you thought about a studio job again?

21:16.734 --> 21:19.569
I've dreamt about that, being an EP again.

21:20.988 --> 21:23.531
There was nothing in Atlanta or New York.

21:23.616 --> 21:26.451
So CNN gave me permission
to explore other options,

21:26.535 --> 21:28.954
and it turns out I don't have any.

21:29.664 --> 21:32.123
Nothing here in DC, London.

21:32.750 --> 21:35.043
I may be down, but I'm not out.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.754
I'm gonna qualify for
the ladies' professional bowling tour.

21:38.881 --> 21:40.715
I don't think you are.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.801
-Based on one frame?
-Yes.

21:42.885 --> 21:45.470
Well, haters gonna hate.

21:45.554 --> 21:47.639
That's not your first beer today, is it?

21:48.641 --> 21:52.519
I'm not sure,
but I think the reason I've been drinking lately

21:52.603 --> 21:55.480
is to numb the feeling of despair.

21:55.564 --> 21:58.817
If you were thinking clearly,
you probably would have asked me by now

21:58.901 --> 22:01.069
why I came down to Washington
to talk to you.

22:02.530 --> 22:03.905
Hang on.

22:05.574 --> 22:08.076
Yeah, that's for sure what I would have done.

22:10.246 --> 22:12.414
I want you to take over News Night.

22:15.209 --> 22:16.251
Hmm?

22:18.587 --> 22:20.463
Excuse me, can you tell me
where Don Keefer's office is?

22:20.548 --> 22:22.382
It's right over there.
You see the name on the door.

22:22.466 --> 22:23.800
Thank you.

22:30.266 --> 22:31.516
Come in.

22:32.435 --> 22:34.352
Good morning. I'm Sloan Sabbith.
I work on dayside.

22:34.437 --> 22:36.271
Yeah, I know you.
<i>Market Rip-off with Sloan Sabbith.</i>

22:37.565 --> 22:38.565
"Wrap-up."

22:38.733 --> 22:40.608
-I'm kidding. It's just what we call...
-Yeah.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.027
It's not a joke about you or the show.

22:42.111 --> 22:43.695
-It's more about how the banks play it...
-I understand.

22:43.779 --> 22:45.238
...a little fast and loose
with subprime mortgages.

22:45.322 --> 22:46.865
It's fine. On dayside, we call you

22:46.949 --> 22:49.242
the executive producer
<i>of Train Wreck with Will McAvoy.</i>

22:49.326 --> 22:52.537
It's not as clever as "Market Rip-off"

22:52.621 --> 22:54.748
'cause it doesn't have
the same alliterative relationship to the...

22:54.832 --> 22:56.332
You know what? How can I help you?

22:57.043 --> 22:58.960
Friday night you had Rothstein on.

22:59.045 --> 23:02.047
It was right after the totally newsworthy
segment on the season finale of 24.

23:02.131 --> 23:04.632
It was the series finale.
And do you have a problem with Jack Bauer?

23:04.717 --> 23:07.844
I've got a problem with Jake Rothstein
and now I've got a problem with Will McAvoy.

23:07.928 --> 23:09.804
Sounds like your problem with Will
started before last night.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.556
It did, but that's neither here nor there.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.392
Rothstein said
it's perfectly legitimate for their firm,

23:14.477 --> 23:15.435
referring to Goldman,

23:15.519 --> 23:18.396
to have sold off those toxic assets
that were exposing them to risk.

23:18.481 --> 23:20.732
"The people who bought them from us
should have known better."

23:20.816 --> 23:22.484
-You did that without notes.
-Yeah.

23:22.568 --> 23:25.278
And you know what McAvoy's follow-up was?
"We'll be right back after this."

23:25.362 --> 23:26.863
You'd have liked to have seen
a tougher follow-up.

23:26.947 --> 23:27.906
Tougher?

23:27.990 --> 23:29.282
You'd have liked to have seen
a tough follow-up.

23:29.366 --> 23:31.743
Or any. How about this...

23:31.827 --> 23:33.745
Wasn't the twisted brilliance of the big banks

23:33.829 --> 23:35.622
that they managed to conceal
a bunch of subprime mortgages

23:35.706 --> 23:38.541
inside a collection of other more
legitimate mortgage-backed securities?

23:38.626 --> 23:41.044
-That wasn't a loaded question?
-I'll deload it.

23:41.128 --> 23:43.421
How would these customers know that
these assets were toxic

23:43.506 --> 23:45.548
since the established companies
gave them a triple-A rating?

23:45.633 --> 23:46.591
You have your own show

23:46.675 --> 23:48.426
and you're free to ask your guests
any questions you'd like.

23:48.511 --> 23:50.762
And I would have,
but my guest, Jacob Rothstein,

23:50.846 --> 23:54.349
was poached by your booker
so your boss could ask him if he watches 24.

23:54.433 --> 23:55.975
This is one of the people
who caused the crash

23:56.060 --> 23:57.560
and is freely roaming the countryside.

23:57.645 --> 23:59.813
Sloan, you came down here
and insulted my anchor

23:59.897 --> 24:02.065
and demanded to know
why we didn't prepare a better interview.

24:02.149 --> 24:04.275
Let me add this to the conversation.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.486
For two years
I've been listening to people like you say

24:06.570 --> 24:09.239
they can't believe no one's been prosecuted
for these Wall Street crimes,

24:09.323 --> 24:11.616
and after two years,
I'm still fuzzy on what crime was committed

24:11.700 --> 24:12.951
and who should be prosecuted for it.

24:13.244 --> 24:16.704
You're a financial news reporter
who gets to spend an hour on one subject

24:16.789 --> 24:18.706
and I'm at least an average consumer of news

24:18.791 --> 24:20.458
and you have failed to get me to understand

24:20.543 --> 24:23.461
what you've called
the most important story of the last 10 years.

24:23.712 --> 24:26.631
So after you get done telling me
how badly we did our job last night,

24:26.715 --> 24:30.135
you may want to do
an internal investigation of your own work.

24:30.219 --> 24:32.011
Visit us any time you want.

24:33.931 --> 24:39.185
I have to disclose to you that I have
a previous relationship with Will McAvoy.

24:40.896 --> 24:42.730
A social relationship.

24:43.732 --> 24:46.151
Romantic.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

24:46.235 --> 24:48.820
I do, and it's excruciating.

24:49.238 --> 24:51.656
I know about that and I couldn't care less.

24:52.032 --> 24:53.575
I've watched the tape

24:53.659 --> 24:56.369
and during the short time
you two worked together at CNN,

24:56.453 --> 24:59.330
you were onto something.
You had the beginning of something good.

24:59.790 --> 25:02.625
Part of the reason was we had a news director
who was willing to say,

25:02.710 --> 25:05.170
"One segment for you
and one segment for me."

25:05.588 --> 25:07.797
I'm a news director who's willing to say

25:07.882 --> 25:09.799
one hour for you and nothing for me.

25:09.884 --> 25:11.217
Why?

25:11.302 --> 25:13.887
'Cause what you want and what I want
are the same thing.

25:14.597 --> 25:18.183
I want to do an hour of news
that's a genuine public service.

25:18.267 --> 25:20.810
-That's what I want.
-Something worthy of a great nation.

25:20.895 --> 25:23.521
There was a time
when journalism wasn't a career.

25:23.606 --> 25:24.898
-Yes. No.
-It was a calling.

25:24.982 --> 25:26.065
-That's right.
-And you agree?

25:26.150 --> 25:28.902
We've been agreeing with each other
for a little while now.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.574
I'm taking on a job
on a new afternoon talk show called Lunch.

25:35.868 --> 25:36.868
I'm sorry?

25:37.369 --> 25:40.371
I'm executive producing
a new daytime talk show

25:40.456 --> 25:42.665
where five people discuss
the issues of the day

25:42.750 --> 25:45.835
as well as lunch,
which will be prepared before our eyes.

25:45.920 --> 25:47.879
-That's your calling?
-No, it's not my calling.

25:47.963 --> 25:49.756
I'm wearing sweatpants. I need a job.

25:50.132 --> 25:51.591
I'm offering you a better one.

25:53.636 --> 25:55.136
I'm not sure it's a better one.

25:55.221 --> 25:58.598
I've been watching Will's descent
into complete surrender for years.

25:58.849 --> 25:59.933
You can change that.

26:00.017 --> 26:02.977
Like it's every little girl's dream
to make a man better at his job.

26:03.062 --> 26:07.232
You know, you're not exactly slaying 'em
in the aisles here at Lucky Strike.

26:07.316 --> 26:10.735
Michael Schumacher
was the Formula 1 champion

26:10.819 --> 26:12.987
for five years in a row.

26:13.072 --> 26:15.782
And I think even the biggest
Michael Schumacher fan

26:15.866 --> 26:19.327
would have to admit that
it's because he was driving the fastest car.

26:20.120 --> 26:23.873
Will may have been at his best
when you were his EP.

26:23.958 --> 26:27.627
But I'd remind you that you were at your best
when he was your anchor.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.256
I'm offering you a fast car.

26:31.799 --> 26:33.424
It's a bit of a fixer-upper.

26:33.509 --> 26:35.260
All of us are.

26:35.844 --> 26:37.428
What happens to Don Keefer?

26:37.513 --> 26:41.140
He moves to 10:00
where Elliot Hirsch is taking over.

26:41.225 --> 26:43.768
Don's a smart guy
and from what I hear, a good EP.

26:43.852 --> 26:47.438
What makes you think I'll have better luck
than Don making your car go fast?

26:48.357 --> 26:51.025
Because Will doesn't care
about impressing Don.

26:52.778 --> 26:55.363
You're not offering me the job
in spite of my history with Will,

26:55.447 --> 26:57.115
you're offering it to me because of it.

26:57.199 --> 26:59.784
I'm offering it to you
because you're my best hope

26:59.868 --> 27:03.538
of turning our flagship news hour
into something we're proud of.

27:08.460 --> 27:13.339
He hasn't returned any of my calls
or emails or letters in

27:16.302 --> 27:17.468
years.

27:19.263 --> 27:21.514
I don't think he's that interested
in what I think of him.

27:22.766 --> 27:25.852
That may be the only thing he's interested in.

27:33.110 --> 27:34.444
An offer's on the table.

27:34.820 --> 27:36.571
Midterms are in six months

27:36.655 --> 27:39.115
and another presidential campaign
in two years.

27:39.199 --> 27:42.035
Take the offer and you'll have a chance
to frame the debate.

27:42.578 --> 27:43.745
Or pass.

27:43.829 --> 27:46.789
But then you never get to complain
about the news again.

27:51.754 --> 27:53.713
Keep your wrist straight.

28:08.812 --> 28:10.146
Thank you.

28:13.442 --> 28:16.110
<i>There you go, one ticket. Next.</i>

28:17.613 --> 28:19.739
-McHale.
<i>-McHale.</i>

28:19.823 --> 28:21.866
M-C-H.

28:22.242 --> 28:23.701
<i>There you go. All set.</i>

28:23.786 --> 28:25.745
-Thank you.
<i>-You're welcome.</i>

28:26.955 --> 28:28.456
<i>Next.</i>

28:30.751 --> 28:33.169
Two tickets. They're under Jennifer Johnson.

28:46.725 --> 28:47.850
Are you going to ask a question?

28:48.685 --> 28:49.685
If I can.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.315
You mind if I ask what you're going to ask?

28:56.276 --> 28:58.111
We were told
the questions weren't going to be screened.

28:58.195 --> 29:01.656
Oh, I don't work here. I was just... I'm curious.

29:02.116 --> 29:03.157
Oh.

29:03.992 --> 29:05.243
It's a stupid question.

29:05.327 --> 29:07.578
-I'm sure it's not.
-No, it is.

29:07.663 --> 29:09.831
It's just with everything...

29:10.499 --> 29:13.584
We're coming out of school
and I'm looking for a reason to be optimistic.

29:13.669 --> 29:16.003
So I wanted to ask all three of them

29:16.088 --> 29:19.507
what they think makes America
the greatest country in the world.

29:22.261 --> 29:25.513
-You're going to ask that to all three of them?
-Yeah.

29:34.189 --> 29:35.565
If you follow me when we get inside,

29:35.649 --> 29:38.651
I'll show you the trick to being the first in line
at a microphone.

29:39.736 --> 29:40.778
All right.

29:50.998 --> 29:53.124
I have a plan, Leona.
I'm not improvising.

29:53.208 --> 29:55.751
I've been up all night with
the most expensive PR people in New York.

29:55.836 --> 29:58.296
I'm gonna speak to the 10,000 Women
initiative at the Clinton Foundation.

29:58.380 --> 30:01.507
I'm sponsoring the Matrix Awards
for Women Leadership in Communication.

30:01.592 --> 30:05.052
And Business Insider is gonna do a profile
on me in which I will be likable.

30:07.556 --> 30:09.682
There's something
I don't think you're understanding.

30:09.892 --> 30:10.933
What's that?

30:12.227 --> 30:16.397
You have a PR problem
because you have an actual problem.

30:20.694 --> 30:23.154
Still don't know why I'm here.

30:23.238 --> 30:25.781
It was a story Charlie wanted
because it was a story Pruit wanted,

30:25.866 --> 30:27.700
and I pretended
we couldn't find the Princeton student

30:27.784 --> 30:29.160
so we wouldn't have to do the segment.

30:29.244 --> 30:31.162
Charlie knew I was lying,
he knew why I was lying.

30:31.246 --> 30:33.831
And I knew he knew why I was lying.
It was a showdown and he lost.

30:35.709 --> 30:38.085
-Yes, he did.
-Yeah.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.380
- MacKenzie was not ineffectual.
- No?

30:41.465 --> 30:42.673
No, she was very much in the fight.

30:43.342 --> 30:45.635
-How so?
-She, too, was beating up Charlie.

30:47.846 --> 30:51.766
Okay, should we go bury him
or do you guys feel like you did that already?

30:53.519 --> 30:56.103
-We should go.
-We should bury him now.

31:02.027 --> 31:03.986
I was expecting more along the lines of,

31:04.071 --> 31:06.364
"Don't beat yourself up.
Of course it's not your fault."

31:06.448 --> 31:08.950
He can get pretty creative with revenge.

31:19.753 --> 31:21.504
-Maggie.
-Hey.

31:21.588 --> 31:23.422
I know it's the wrong place,
but congratulations.

31:23.507 --> 31:26.259
I heard they're bringing you down to DC
to interview for a field producer job.

31:26.343 --> 31:28.052
Yeah, tomorrow.

31:28.136 --> 31:30.054
-Good luck. You're gonna get it.
-Thanks.

31:30.430 --> 31:32.139
You want it, right?

31:32.432 --> 31:33.808
Definitely.

31:36.228 --> 31:39.480
Should I care that Jim was the one
who recommended me for it?

31:40.524 --> 31:42.275
You mean because it takes you out of town?

31:43.026 --> 31:45.570
After three years,
we started dating three days ago.

31:46.238 --> 31:48.447
No. The answer is no. You shouldn't care.

31:49.658 --> 31:50.825
Right.

31:54.162 --> 31:55.496
What are you smiling about?

31:56.915 --> 32:00.293
This is the stuff
that drove Charlie out of his mind.

32:01.044 --> 32:03.337
He'd appreciate that
we're still doing it at his funeral.

32:03.547 --> 32:05.381
No, he wouldn't.

32:06.508 --> 32:08.050
I know, but,

32:09.469 --> 32:10.761
you know.

32:13.557 --> 32:14.682
Yeah.

32:22.149 --> 32:24.233
<i>All right, yeah, you, um, sorority girl.</i>

32:24.610 --> 32:27.278
<i>In case you accidently wander</i>
<i>into a voting booth one day,</i>

32:27.362 --> 32:29.488
<i>there's some things you should know</i>
<i>and one of them is</i>

32:29.573 --> 32:32.241
<i>there is absolutely no evidence</i>
<i>to support the statement</i>

32:32.326 --> 32:33.868
<i>that we're the greatest country in the world.</i>

32:33.952 --> 32:36.579
<i>And with a straight face</i>
<i>you're gonna tell students</i>

32:36.663 --> 32:38.873
<i>that America is so star-spangled awesome</i>

32:38.957 --> 32:41.459
<i>that we're the only ones in the world</i>
<i>who have freedom?</i>

32:41.543 --> 32:44.962
<i>If liberals are so fucking smart,</i>
<i>how come they lose so goddamn always?</i>

32:45.547 --> 32:48.549
<i>So when you ask what makes us</i>
<i>the greatest country in the world,</i>

32:48.634 --> 32:50.301
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what the fuck you're talking about.</i>

32:50.677 --> 32:52.428
- <i>-Yosemite?</i>

32:53.221 --> 32:54.722
<i>My name is Jenna. I'm a sophomore.</i>

32:55.223 --> 32:57.600
<i>- And this is for all three of you.</i>

33:01.688 --> 33:04.607
I thought I saw someone I knew
in the audience and she was prompting me.

33:04.691 --> 33:06.192
I was asked a question from the audience

33:06.276 --> 33:10.196
and she wrote an answer down on a pad
and pointed to it the way a producer would.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.281
But it was a hallucination.

33:12.991 --> 33:16.077
Which I didn't think those really happened,
but they do.

33:16.161 --> 33:17.411
Never doubt them again.

33:18.205 --> 33:19.246
Hmm.

33:23.919 --> 33:26.128
You're not as helpful
as your movie counterparts.

33:30.300 --> 33:31.425
<i>Oui?</i>

33:35.931 --> 33:36.931
You Mr. McAvoy?

33:38.141 --> 33:39.141
Yeah.

33:39.226 --> 33:41.268
Phone call for you.

33:43.105 --> 33:45.773
- Hello?
<i>- I made Charlie give me the number.</i>

33:45.899 --> 33:47.024
Leona?

33:47.109 --> 33:48.192
Are you all right?

33:48.276 --> 33:50.152
<i>-Is this Leona?</i>
-Yeah.

33:50.946 --> 33:52.863
-I'm sorry.
<i>-What happened?</i>

33:53.323 --> 33:54.323
I don't know.

33:54.408 --> 33:56.158
You cursed at a college student.

33:56.451 --> 33:58.619
<i>Yeah, I know this is embarrassing for you...</i>

33:58.704 --> 34:03.124
I'm not worried about me, I'm...
You've made a career out of being likable.

34:05.836 --> 34:08.462
I'd like to make a career
out of doing the news.

34:13.969 --> 34:14.969
Leona?

34:15.387 --> 34:17.179
Who's stopping ya?

34:27.357 --> 34:30.067
<i>We were able to be all these things</i>
<i>and do all these things</i>

34:30.152 --> 34:32.153
<i>because we were informed.</i>

34:33.071 --> 34:34.989
<i>By great men. Men who were revered.</i>

34:37.117 --> 34:39.952
<i>- The first step to solving a problem is...</i>

34:42.581 --> 34:43.581
Hello?

34:44.040 --> 34:45.207
Charlie?

34:45.584 --> 34:47.501
<i>Speaking. Who's this?</i>

34:48.503 --> 34:49.962
It's MacKenzie.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.173
-MacKenzie.
-Yeah.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.217
<i>-Look...</i>
-Yes.

34:55.510 --> 34:58.429
-What was that?
-I'm in.

35:03.018 --> 35:05.102
Yeah?

35:05.187 --> 35:07.980
Markets rely on Standard & Poor's
to objectively rate debt.

35:08.064 --> 35:09.940
But the companies that
want a favorable debt rating

35:10.025 --> 35:11.942
are the same companies
that pay Standard & Poor's.

35:12.027 --> 35:13.736
-You follow so far?
-Yeah.

35:13.820 --> 35:16.447
Banks wrote a ton of bad mortgages
to people they knew were going to default.

35:16.531 --> 35:17.823
It's called predatory lending.

35:17.908 --> 35:19.700
Then hid those bad mortgages
inside good mortgages

35:19.785 --> 35:22.328
to shine up the books for S&P,
which gave them triple-A ratings.

35:22.704 --> 35:24.622
Then they'd bundle the whole thing
and sell the debt

35:24.706 --> 35:26.832
to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,
which is owned by...

35:26.917 --> 35:28.834
-You and me.
-Yes.

35:28.919 --> 35:30.795
And then the banks bet
on those loans defaulting.

35:31.129 --> 35:33.130
Not that much different from
fixing a college basketball game

35:33.215 --> 35:35.508
except a ton of people
wind up broke and homeless.

35:35.717 --> 35:37.218
Those people can't buy things anymore,

35:37.302 --> 35:39.929
so businesses start going out of business
and more people are broke.

35:40.013 --> 35:42.097
When you start eliminating consumers,
you start eliminating jobs,

35:42.182 --> 35:43.516
which eliminates consumers,
which eliminates jobs,

35:43.600 --> 35:45.351
which eliminates consumers,
and you see where this is going?

35:45.435 --> 35:46.811
I'm no longer the EP of News Night.

35:48.021 --> 35:49.271
What happened?

35:49.356 --> 35:50.689
Charlie's bringing in a new EP

35:50.774 --> 35:53.400
and I'm moving to 10:00
where Elliot Hirsch is taking over.

35:55.195 --> 35:56.195
I'm sorry.

35:58.031 --> 35:59.615
Will blew the Rothstein interview.

35:59.991 --> 36:03.035
He doesn't like to appear rude
except when he's not on TV.

36:04.579 --> 36:07.206
We'd have done everyone a favor
if we had let you keep him as a guest.

36:09.334 --> 36:11.001
Have a good night.

36:11.378 --> 36:12.670
Yeah, you, too.

36:23.265 --> 36:26.767
-Service elevator is broken.
-That's no problem.

36:30.438 --> 36:33.232
Would it be forward if I asked a man
if he wanted to get a cup of coffee?

36:34.025 --> 36:37.611
I was kind of in his face
and then it turned out he got a demotion, so...

36:37.988 --> 36:40.781
And if he says no, then I've got to
come to work with him every day.

36:42.409 --> 36:43.993
You want coffee?

36:45.453 --> 36:47.621
No. That's very nice of you.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.785
Listen and watch.

37:40.300 --> 37:42.718
-Hello?
<i>-It's MacKenzie. Let me up.</i>

38:01.738 --> 38:03.989
-Hey.
-Hey. What happened here?

38:04.866 --> 38:06.450
Most of the furniture was Audrey's.

38:06.826 --> 38:08.619
Some of it was mine, but she liked it.

38:08.703 --> 38:10.454
And so you gave away your furniture?

38:10.538 --> 38:12.957
-Seemed like the least I could do.
-She didn't take it well.

38:13.041 --> 38:15.417
She called me a Lost Boy.
That's Peter Pan, right?

38:15.502 --> 38:17.795
-Yeah.
-Like I'm fighting Indians and pirates?

38:17.879 --> 38:19.421
-Is that what she meant?
-No.

38:19.506 --> 38:22.132
Long-distance relationships
don't ever work, ever.

38:22.384 --> 38:23.884
Do you know one that's worked?

38:23.969 --> 38:26.971
-John and Abigail Adams.
-We don't know that that worked.

38:27.055 --> 38:31.433
They wrote nice letters for a while,
but they could have grown distant.

38:31.518 --> 38:33.352
Audrey took a job in Baltimore.

38:33.436 --> 38:34.937
-I know.
-That's a 45-minute drive.

38:35.021 --> 38:37.815
The mileage wasn't the important thing.

38:37.899 --> 38:40.442
-You wanted to break up with Audrey.
-That was the important thing.

38:40.819 --> 38:43.320
Charlie Skinner wants me
to take over News Night at ACN.

38:43.405 --> 38:47.241
I'm doing it and I want you to come with me
and be our senior producer.

38:49.953 --> 38:50.953
Say that again.

38:51.246 --> 38:53.747
I'm taking over News Night
and I want you to be my second.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.669
What, are you doing cleanup
after what happened at Northwestern?

38:58.753 --> 39:01.088
Actually, I don't think
Northwestern needs to be cleaned up.

39:01.172 --> 39:02.673
No, we're just going to start over.

39:02.757 --> 39:04.800
What would be your idea of a good newscast?

39:05.260 --> 39:07.803
One that wasn't required
to care that much about revenues.

39:08.263 --> 39:11.015
Me, too, but that would take
a news director who felt the same way.

39:11.099 --> 39:12.099
Right.

39:12.934 --> 39:15.602
Jim, Charlie Skinner
is on some kind of mission.

39:16.229 --> 39:18.355
He's dead serious.
He messengered a book to me...

39:18.440 --> 39:20.858
It would take more than a news director.

39:20.942 --> 39:22.943
-Will McAvoy...
-Comes with an audience.

39:23.028 --> 39:26.321
And, trust me,
you have no idea what he can do.

39:26.406 --> 39:29.450
He has a gear you've never seen.

39:30.118 --> 39:32.244
-So what was the book?
-The book?

39:33.121 --> 39:36.915
You said Charlie Skinner was on a mission
and that he messengered you some book.

39:55.310 --> 39:59.021
Listen up. In the past,
if you came to me with tips for healthy living,

39:59.105 --> 40:01.315
you might have found something
in the tone of my response

40:01.399 --> 40:03.108
that discouraged you
from ever saying that again.

40:03.193 --> 40:05.069
But now I'm issuing a whole new decree.

40:05.153 --> 40:06.445
I want your health advice.

40:06.529 --> 40:10.532
It's suddenly very important to me
that I live for a long time.

40:10.617 --> 40:11.617
Jesus!

40:19.959 --> 40:20.918
What happened?

40:21.002 --> 40:22.336
- I'm not sure.
- I have no idea.

40:23.379 --> 40:25.089
Smack me in the face
as hard as you can.

40:25.173 --> 40:26.715
-I'm not kidding.
-Why?

40:26.800 --> 40:28.759
-You won't hurt me, I promise you.
-No, I can't.

40:28.843 --> 40:30.052
-I can.
-Do it.

40:32.055 --> 40:33.055
I was wrong. That hurt.

40:33.139 --> 40:36.100
But do that if you ever see me
put a cigarette in my mouth again.

40:36.184 --> 40:38.811
-Neal's plane landed.
-All right, Neal's plane landed!

40:41.481 --> 40:43.232
-Why suddenly?
-What?

40:43.566 --> 40:45.901
You said it was suddenly
very important that you live a long time.

40:45.985 --> 40:47.444
- Did I?
- Yeah.

40:49.364 --> 40:51.115
-Okay.
-Oh, my God.

40:51.199 --> 40:52.199
-Hang on.
-Oh, my God.

40:52.659 --> 40:54.034
-What?
-Will!

40:54.119 --> 40:56.620
I think there's a rule about this
and I may have stumbled...

40:56.704 --> 40:59.039
-Are you serious?
-...into an area where I'm not sure of the law

40:59.124 --> 41:01.333
and I'm gonna get approval
before commenting any further.

41:01.417 --> 41:03.794
This conversation never happened
except for the slap and the cigarettes.

41:03.878 --> 41:06.964
Tess, Tamara, Kendra,
just record right over it in your brain.

41:07.048 --> 41:09.967
Martin doesn't have a clue,
so we're not going to worry about that.

41:10.051 --> 41:13.887
Respect the boss. You know,
employee fear of being punished at work.

41:20.520 --> 41:23.188
-Can I talk to you?
-Sure. Excuse me.

41:25.233 --> 41:26.817
I've just had a conversation with someone

41:26.901 --> 41:29.945
I'm only allowed to identify
as a senior member of ACN.

41:30.029 --> 41:31.155
-This person told me...
-Sloan?

41:31.239 --> 41:32.698
A senior member of ACN.

41:33.283 --> 41:34.867
You're standing in front of a mirror

41:34.951 --> 41:38.078
and 10 feet behind you is Sloan,
who's monitoring the conversation.

41:38.705 --> 41:40.497
You want me to join you?

41:40.582 --> 41:41.665
You told him what I told you?

41:41.749 --> 41:43.542
-It had to be done.
-It so didn't.

41:43.626 --> 41:46.003
You think that because
I recommended you for the job in DC

41:46.087 --> 41:47.671
that I don't care that you might move to DC?

41:47.755 --> 41:50.507
-I never said that.
-It's easy to interpret as a soft breakup.

41:50.592 --> 41:52.176
-I don't even know what that is.
-He does.

41:52.260 --> 41:53.760
- It's a promotion, Maggie.
- I know.

41:53.845 --> 41:55.888
It's field producing. It's what you want to do.

41:55.972 --> 41:57.598
-She knows.
-What are you still doing here?

41:58.141 --> 41:59.141
I'm brokering this thing

41:59.225 --> 42:01.393
because we're all a little tired
of you two missing such easy shots.

42:01.477 --> 42:02.769
Things aren't as complicated
as you make them.

42:03.104 --> 42:04.688
You're dating my ex-boyfriend, right?

42:05.106 --> 42:06.899
-Yeah.
-Okay.

42:06.983 --> 42:09.359
I wasn't doing you a favor.
I was doing them a favor.

42:09.444 --> 42:11.820
But you didn't even mention anything like,

42:11.905 --> 42:14.531
"It'll mean we're not living in the same city.
Bummer."

42:14.949 --> 42:16.992
Really?
"Bummer" was what you were looking for?

42:17.076 --> 42:19.995
Not "bummer." Not...
You know what I'm saying.

42:20.079 --> 42:21.371
-You know what she's saying.
-Sloan.

42:21.456 --> 42:23.081
-Something better than that.
-Can we have a minute?

42:23.541 --> 42:24.625
Yeah.

42:27.629 --> 42:29.046
I don't want this to get out of hand.

42:29.130 --> 42:31.298
-I recommended you...
-Wait. I...

42:31.382 --> 42:33.175
I don't want this to get out of hand.

42:33.259 --> 42:35.594
We kissed on the plane three nights ago.

42:35.678 --> 42:37.095
It's only been three nights.

42:37.180 --> 42:39.473
And, yes,
we've slept together every night since.

42:39.557 --> 42:42.309
We talked about having a night of celibacy
in honor of Charlie,

42:42.393 --> 42:44.770
but then we both made
pretty strong arguments

42:44.854 --> 42:46.396
why he wouldn't have wanted it that way.

42:46.481 --> 42:47.981
I... I'm not delusional.

42:49.609 --> 42:52.986
I don't think this is more than it is.
Don't panic.

42:55.156 --> 42:57.824
And I really appreciate the recommendation.

43:02.163 --> 43:04.581
So things got rough Monday night?

43:04.666 --> 43:07.334
Sloan Sabbith conducted an interview
that embarrassed the network.

43:07.669 --> 43:09.670
She tore apart our website.
She tore apart our app.

43:09.754 --> 43:12.297
She tore apart the guy who's running
the website who designed the app.

43:12.382 --> 43:14.258
And she did it with MacKenzie's approval.

43:14.342 --> 43:16.009
How am I supposed to not fire them both?

43:16.094 --> 43:17.094
Do you still want me here?

43:18.137 --> 43:23.308
You know, there were times when I thought
if I was at Charlie Skinner's funeral,

43:23.601 --> 43:25.143
it'd be because I'd killed him.

43:27.146 --> 43:30.190
If you're not fighting with your news director,
you're not doing your job.

43:30.775 --> 43:33.777
And if they're not fighting with you,
they're not doing their job.

43:34.862 --> 43:39.366
Because the truth is,
you don't want the ACN you think you do.

43:40.201 --> 43:42.202
If you got it,
you'd be like the dog that caught the car.

43:43.079 --> 43:45.122
You want the ACN that makes as much money

43:45.206 --> 43:49.042
as these naive, financially illiterate journalists
will let you make.

43:49.127 --> 43:53.422
But if I were you,
I would find the one person I know

43:53.506 --> 43:57.092
who will argue with you until you fire them.

43:57.593 --> 44:01.972
And keep on arguing with you
until security escorts them from the building.

44:03.057 --> 44:06.560
But what does this have to do
with your current problem?

44:08.896 --> 44:09.896
Yeah.

44:10.148 --> 44:11.481
Do you even know
what the fuck we're talking about?

44:11.566 --> 44:12.899
Not as such, no.

44:15.653 --> 44:17.154
<i>The Hurt Locker.</i>

44:17.238 --> 44:19.323
-Come on.
<i>-The Hurt Locker.</i>

44:19.407 --> 44:20.741
It won Best Picture. It beat Avatar.

44:21.242 --> 44:22.868
Avatar should be second.

44:22.952 --> 44:25.871
<i>The Hurt Locker and Avatar</i>
are both overrated?

44:25.955 --> 44:27.164
Gravity. Take this down.

44:27.707 --> 44:30.667
Listening to everyone rave about it
beyond the score and visual effects

44:30.752 --> 44:32.336
was like overhearing an inside joke

44:32.420 --> 44:35.756
that only well-respected movie critics
were really in on.

44:36.090 --> 44:37.549
-Put it up.
-If you say so.

44:37.633 --> 44:41.303
The Descendants. The problem
with The Descendants is that it sucked.

44:44.640 --> 44:45.682
What just happened?

44:45.767 --> 44:47.351
-What the hell?
-We get hacked?

44:47.435 --> 44:50.103
No, this wasn't a hacker.
Somebody just walked right in.

44:54.192 --> 44:55.442
I shut it down from my phone.

44:58.071 --> 44:59.821
-Are you Neal?
-Yeah.

45:00.656 --> 45:01.782
Welcome back, man.

45:01.866 --> 45:04.534
"The Nine Most Overrated Movies of All Time."

45:05.203 --> 45:07.454
-We thought it would be fun.
-For who?

45:07.955 --> 45:10.707
For movie fans. Look, I know this...

45:10.792 --> 45:12.542
And I saw you went
all the way back to The Matrix.

45:12.627 --> 45:15.087
-Yeah.
-1999.

45:16.130 --> 45:17.130
Yeah.

45:18.257 --> 45:21.885
All time and 14 years are
two different units of measurement.

45:21.969 --> 45:27.307
But my question is why is overrated
more fun than, say, underrated?

45:30.395 --> 45:32.020
You embarrass me.

45:33.106 --> 45:34.064
I what?

45:34.148 --> 45:37.275
It took me a long time to build ACN Digital.

45:37.819 --> 45:39.820
I was laughed at
by the people in this newsroom.

45:39.904 --> 45:42.364
People I respect
didn't respect what I did around here,

45:42.448 --> 45:45.867
but I built this into a tool that gathered,
expanded on,

45:45.952 --> 45:48.829
and disseminated information that's useful.

45:49.163 --> 45:51.456
I kept telling my colleagues and my bosses

45:51.541 --> 45:53.750
that the Internet is user-sensitive
just like most things.

45:53.835 --> 45:57.421
And I've watched from 1,000 miles away
while you proved that.

46:01.926 --> 46:03.552
You embarrass me.

46:08.641 --> 46:10.892
Build a page that says
the site's down for repair.

46:10.977 --> 46:13.770
-For an hour?
-For a week.

46:13.855 --> 46:15.188
We're gonna rebuild the whole thing.

46:17.400 --> 46:18.775
I'm sorry about Charlie Skinner.

46:22.280 --> 46:23.405
Thank you.

46:34.542 --> 46:35.542
What are you doing?

46:36.836 --> 46:39.713
I'm just looking
at the bedroom of a small boy.

46:41.883 --> 46:44.634
We've got to finish the renovation
on the apartment and then sell it.

46:44.719 --> 46:49.055
We need a house with a pile of leaves in front
on a flat street where he can ride a bike.

46:49.390 --> 46:50.932
You didn't speak at the burial.

46:52.852 --> 46:54.811
-Yeah.
-You were going to say a few words.

46:54.896 --> 46:56.313
-I know.
-What's going on?

46:56.397 --> 46:58.064
I just don't know what to say.

46:58.149 --> 47:00.525
Every time I think of something, it's reductive.

47:02.236 --> 47:06.406
Well, I think everyone would like
to hear from you before they leave.

47:17.919 --> 47:20.545
I've put something aside to give you.

47:21.214 --> 47:23.048
-Mrs. Skinner.
-Nancy.

47:23.132 --> 47:24.257
Nancy.

47:26.427 --> 47:28.929
I have to tell you I may have
contributed to Charlie's heart attack.

47:30.181 --> 47:31.389
I may have caused it.

47:32.975 --> 47:35.477
There was a story Charlie wanted me to do
and I didn't want to do it.

47:35.561 --> 47:37.896
And he got angry and...

47:38.439 --> 47:39.981
Are you talking about the Princeton student?

47:40.066 --> 47:41.691
Am I... Yeah.

47:42.777 --> 47:44.694
He didn't want to do that story either.

47:45.321 --> 47:48.323
He was praying
you were gonna fight him on it.

47:48.407 --> 47:52.744
The last seven weeks were hell for him
since Leona sold the network to Pruit.

47:53.246 --> 47:56.331
He wasn't angry that
you guys were fighting him.

47:56.791 --> 47:57.999
He was counting on it.

47:59.377 --> 48:02.462
He loved you, Don.
And he was so proud of you.

48:03.839 --> 48:05.715
I doubt you killed him.

48:06.342 --> 48:11.221
That had to be hard to say to me
and I appreciate it, but I don't care.

48:12.056 --> 48:15.058
I care what you did for him while he was alive.

48:15.184 --> 48:19.396
Anyway, this is silly, but I want you to have it.

48:32.493 --> 48:33.493
Thank you.

48:42.336 --> 48:43.920
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

48:51.178 --> 48:53.722
-How you doing?
-My grandfather died.

48:55.850 --> 48:58.852
Well, you know, kid, I'm sorry,
but I've got my own problems.

48:59.687 --> 49:00.854
My best friend died.

49:02.732 --> 49:04.107
Wait a second.

49:04.191 --> 49:06.818
You think there's a chance
we're talking about the same person?

49:07.278 --> 49:08.445
You know we are.

49:09.864 --> 49:11.114
Where's your brother Bo?

49:11.198 --> 49:12.866
He's probably in the garage.

49:12.950 --> 49:14.826
He's always there. He's got a band.

49:16.370 --> 49:18.663
-Would you take me to him?
-Sure.

49:33.512 --> 49:34.554
- Bo.
- Hey. Hello.

49:36.474 --> 49:37.724
The place looks great.

49:38.142 --> 49:40.018
Thanks. We're, uh... We're pretty good.

49:40.936 --> 49:43.355
Not great, but maybe one day.

49:43.773 --> 49:45.732
-Yeah? You mind?
-No.

49:47.026 --> 49:48.860
That's right, you play guitar on the side.

49:49.195 --> 49:51.488
I'm a news anchor on the side.

49:56.327 --> 49:59.079
-Listen, can I ask you something?
-Sure.

50:00.539 --> 50:01.915
Was he...

50:03.250 --> 50:06.961
Between the time he had the heart attack
and the time he died,

50:07.046 --> 50:09.047
do you think
he would have been in a lot of pain?

50:11.092 --> 50:14.094
You know, that's exactly
the kind of question he'd have asked.

50:16.013 --> 50:17.055
They'd have sedated him.

50:17.598 --> 50:18.807
You think he was scared?

50:21.268 --> 50:25.146
I wasn't there.
When it happened, I wasn't there.

50:30.653 --> 50:31.736
I know a song you like.

50:33.781 --> 50:37.617
If you love somebody enough

50:37.702 --> 50:40.537
<i>You follow wherever they go</i>

50:40.621 --> 50:46.584
<i>That's how I got to Memphis</i>

50:49.463 --> 50:52.549
<i>If you love somebody enough</i>

50:53.008 --> 50:55.885
<i>You'll go where your heart wants to go</i>

50:56.053 --> 50:58.722
<i>That's how I got to Memphis</i>

51:00.141 --> 51:02.517
<i>That's how I got to Memphis...</i>

51:02.601 --> 51:03.727
-Can you play that thing?
-Yeah.

51:04.311 --> 51:05.395
Go to the five.

51:06.897 --> 51:09.733
<i>I know if you'd seen her, you'd tell me</i>

51:09.817 --> 51:11.860
<i>'Cause you are my friend</i>

51:14.655 --> 51:16.781
<i>I've got to find her</i>

51:16.866 --> 51:19.534
<i>Find out the trouble she's in...</i>

51:21.871 --> 51:23.538
Jim Harper's here.

51:23.956 --> 51:27.876
<i>If you tell me she's not here</i>

51:27.960 --> 51:31.087
<i>I'll follow the trail of her tears</i>

51:31.172 --> 51:37.218
<i>That's how I got to Memphis</i>

51:39.346 --> 51:42.766
<i>She would get mad and she used to say</i>

51:43.559 --> 51:46.519
<i>She'd go back to Memphis someday</i>

51:46.604 --> 51:52.901
<i>That's how I got to Memphis</i>

51:55.321 --> 51:58.615
<i>I haven't eaten a bite</i>

51:58.699 --> 52:02.243
<i>I haven't slept three days or nights</i>

52:02.328 --> 52:08.124
<i>That's how I got to Memphis</i>

52:08.209 --> 52:10.043
Here comes a fancy solo.

52:11.504 --> 52:13.129
Hit it! Go!

52:16.300 --> 52:18.551
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, damn.

52:19.512 --> 52:21.971
Oh, that's sweet.

52:24.433 --> 52:26.059
--Thank you.

52:26.393 --> 52:28.102
<i>I've got to find her</i>

52:28.187 --> 52:31.189
<i>And tell her that I love her so</i>

52:34.235 --> 52:35.568
<i>I'll never rest</i>

52:35.653 --> 52:38.863
<i>Till I find out why she had to go</i>

52:43.911 --> 52:46.287
<i>Thank you for your precious time</i>

52:47.206 --> 52:50.208
<i>Please forgive me if I start to cry</i>

52:50.292 --> 52:56.965
<i>That's how I got to Memphis</i>

53:02.805 --> 53:06.057
Will, MacKenzie says
it's time to head back to the studio.

53:06.141 --> 53:07.725
Thank you.

53:14.525 --> 53:17.193
I know your parents' divorce has been tough.

53:17.278 --> 53:20.446
I know you talked to your grandfather
about it a lot.

53:23.367 --> 53:25.326
I'd be good at that, too.

53:25.411 --> 53:27.203
Or if you just want to play music.

53:28.247 --> 53:29.247
Thanks.

53:34.712 --> 53:36.170
Come on, Ned.

53:38.632 --> 53:40.717
-Wonderful service.
-It was, wasn't it?

53:40.801 --> 53:42.802
-I'm so glad you came.
-Oh, God...

53:46.599 --> 53:47.807
There he is. Will.

53:48.434 --> 53:50.560
By any chance, did you tell
anyone about the pregnancy?

53:50.978 --> 53:53.813
No, absolutely not. You're not supposed to
do that till after the first semester.

53:54.064 --> 53:55.148
Trimester.

53:55.232 --> 53:57.400
Tess, Kendra, Tamara and Martin
tricked me into telling them.

53:57.484 --> 54:00.612
Congratulations, you guys.
That's gonna be one good-looking kid.

54:01.614 --> 54:02.614
And then they might have told some people.

54:03.282 --> 54:05.950
-Will, could I have a word?
-Yeah.

54:08.120 --> 54:10.580
You know what I always thought
would be fun if I was a parent?

54:10.664 --> 54:13.416
You teach your kid something wrong
like wood comes from birds

54:13.500 --> 54:15.418
and you see how long you can keep it going.

54:15.502 --> 54:16.920
They're all grown up and at a dinner party

54:17.004 --> 54:19.172
and people are admiring the table
and your kid says,

54:19.381 --> 54:21.132
"It took a lot of sparrows to make that table."

54:22.718 --> 54:26.554
But people have different parenting styles.
There's no right way or wrong way.

54:26.639 --> 54:28.640
Maybe there's a wrong way.

54:29.183 --> 54:31.893
- What was that?
- We should go to the car.

54:31.977 --> 54:33.603
You're not going to be reductive.

54:33.687 --> 54:35.730
-Are you sure you don't want to say anything?
-Yeah, I'm good.

54:35.814 --> 54:37.231
Okay.

54:37.316 --> 54:38.775
Excuse me!

54:40.194 --> 54:42.028
Excuse me. Uh, excuse me, everybody.

54:42.112 --> 54:45.323
I just want to say, people...

54:45.407 --> 54:47.784
I've been trying to piece together
what happened last Monday night.

54:47.868 --> 54:50.745
People have been giving me their accounts.

54:50.829 --> 54:54.582
Seems everyone feels responsible
for Charlie dying

54:54.667 --> 54:56.542
and, of course, that's ridiculous. It was Sloan.

54:58.253 --> 55:00.254
Charlie Skinner was crazy.

55:01.882 --> 55:03.758
He identified with Don Quixote,

55:04.468 --> 55:07.804
an old man with dementia
who thought he could save the world

55:07.888 --> 55:11.224
from an epidemic of incivility
simply by acting like a knight.

55:11.684 --> 55:14.352
His religion was decency.

55:15.104 --> 55:17.563
And he spent a lifetime fighting its enemies.

55:22.319 --> 55:24.320
I wish he could be here

55:24.405 --> 55:27.699
to learn the name of his successor
like I just did.

55:29.660 --> 55:32.870
Our new boss, the new president of ACN,

55:34.039 --> 55:35.873
is MacKenzie McHale.

55:41.296 --> 55:43.923
So this fight is just getting started.

55:45.509 --> 55:48.094
'Cause he taught
the rest of us to be crazy, too.

55:51.015 --> 55:53.016
You were a man, Charlie.

55:54.727 --> 55:56.811
You were a great, big man.

56:05.529 --> 56:07.613
Let's go through the rundown in five minutes.

56:12.119 --> 56:13.995
- Come in.
- You wanted to see me?

56:14.538 --> 56:15.747
I'm promoting you.

56:15.831 --> 56:19.959
You're taking over as executive producer
of News Night starting Monday.

56:21.503 --> 56:23.212
Mac, I think you should offer it to Don.

56:23.297 --> 56:25.423
It was his job and I think he's earned it back.

56:25.507 --> 56:27.592
I offered it to him. He wants to stay at 10:00.

56:27.676 --> 56:30.553
He said he's onto something, he and Elliot,
and he wants to keep going.

56:30.637 --> 56:32.472
And he said he likes having the last word.

56:33.432 --> 56:37.518
No, it's yours, Jim. ACN's flagship show.

56:40.314 --> 56:41.564
I won't let you down.

56:43.192 --> 56:44.484
You never have.

56:53.827 --> 56:56.496
-Cancel the interview in DC.
-Why?

56:56.872 --> 56:58.206
I'm the new EP of News Night

56:58.290 --> 57:00.249
and my first move
is making you senior producer.

57:01.293 --> 57:03.169
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

57:03.921 --> 57:05.755
Congratulations!

57:05.839 --> 57:08.007
-Thank you. Thank you.
-That's sensational.

57:14.181 --> 57:18.893
I'm incredibly flattered,
but I'm going to interview for the other job.

57:19.311 --> 57:20.353
Why?

57:21.063 --> 57:25.274
I want to be a field producer. It's DC.
I'll be in line for the White House.

57:26.235 --> 57:28.111
Is this because I recommended you for the job

57:28.195 --> 57:29.737
-and then wasn't upset enough that you...
-No.

57:30.072 --> 57:32.281
Then why wouldn't you
want to be senior producer?

57:33.450 --> 57:37.411
I want to be a field producer. It's DC.
I'll be in line for the White House.

57:37.496 --> 57:40.331
-Did you not hear me the first time?
-Fine.

57:41.041 --> 57:42.875
-Fine?
-It was a big deal.

57:43.836 --> 57:46.963
I don't care how many days it's been
and I'm not delusional either.

57:47.673 --> 57:50.716
It is more than it is.

57:54.471 --> 57:56.097
It is to me, too.

57:57.349 --> 57:59.308
-Really?
-Yeah.

58:00.811 --> 58:01.811
I just said those things.

58:02.855 --> 58:03.855
You'll stay in New York?

58:05.440 --> 58:09.819
No. I'm going to interview for the job in DC.
You know why?

58:12.739 --> 58:14.991
I'll take the last plane every Friday night
after the show

58:15.075 --> 58:16.659
and then the first plane back on Mondays.

58:17.244 --> 58:19.036
Or sometimes I could come to New York.

58:19.121 --> 58:20.663
Or meet in the middle of New Jersey.

58:20.747 --> 58:21.747
-That's right.
-Yeah.

58:22.791 --> 58:25.418
Have you had a lot
of long-distance relationships?

58:26.587 --> 58:28.546
-Yes.
-Have any of them worked?

58:28.839 --> 58:29.839
No.

58:30.716 --> 58:33.968
-Then why is this going to be different?
-I wasn't in love with them.

58:35.804 --> 58:37.180
Wait, what?

58:48.442 --> 58:50.776
-You turned down News Night?
-Yeah.

58:51.445 --> 58:54.030
I figured why do a broadcast
with 1.1 million viewers

58:54.114 --> 58:57.491
when I can do one for 287,000
and make less money at the same time?

58:57.576 --> 59:01.162
-Yeah, why do you do that?
-It's getting better. It's getting good.

59:01.413 --> 59:02.663
It's been good for a long time.

59:03.040 --> 59:05.625
Next quarter it'll be 288,000. You'll see.

59:05.959 --> 59:07.084
So we're all landing on our feet.

59:07.336 --> 59:08.419
Mmm-hmm.

59:09.463 --> 59:10.463
Except for you killing Charlie.

59:10.756 --> 59:11.839
Don't even... That's not funny.

59:14.259 --> 59:16.219
Doesn't it bother anyone
that after the life he led,

59:16.303 --> 59:18.554
he literally died fighting for something
he didn't believe in?

59:19.139 --> 59:22.516
When Pruit tried to fire you and Mac,
we saw what Charlie believed in in a hurry.

59:25.103 --> 59:26.729
I just miss him.

59:28.857 --> 59:30.149
Hey.

59:32.194 --> 59:34.820
Nancy gave me something
she wanted you to have.

59:34.905 --> 59:36.614
-What is it?
-I don't know.

59:50.337 --> 59:52.922
Okay, I need a list of all the routes
to the closest hospitals.

59:53.006 --> 59:54.006
Why?

59:54.466 --> 59:56.676
Safety counts. Someone could hit their head.

59:57.177 --> 1:00:00.471
I want a list of the 10 best OB/GYNs
in the world.

1:00:00.555 --> 1:00:01.722
Why is that?

1:00:01.807 --> 1:00:04.141
'Cause if a woman hits her head,
I think she'd feel more comfortable...

1:00:04.226 --> 1:00:06.185
-That's not the way it works.
-We'll do more later.

1:00:06.270 --> 1:00:07.853
I'm gonna need some answers to questions

1:00:07.938 --> 1:00:10.147
like why does water come out of a faucet,
but I'll make a list.

1:00:11.191 --> 1:00:13.526
-Congratulations.
-You told her I was pregnant?

1:00:14.319 --> 1:00:15.361
You're pregnant?

1:00:15.445 --> 1:00:17.613
She was congratulating you on the job.

1:00:17.698 --> 1:00:19.573
-Damn it.
-Please don't mention it to anyone.

1:00:19.825 --> 1:00:21.701
- Oh, everyone knows.
- Okay.

1:00:23.996 --> 1:00:26.914
It was the Kwench story
and the models at the party.

1:00:26.999 --> 1:00:29.792
Leona convinced him
to give a woman a high-level promotion.

1:00:30.210 --> 1:00:32.378
Yeah, that's probably right, but who cares?

1:00:32.462 --> 1:00:35.006
What does it matter how you got the job?
You have the job.

1:00:35.090 --> 1:00:37.967
You're gonna get to do the job.
That's a really big deal.

1:00:38.051 --> 1:00:40.469
It's gonna be harder than it was for Charlie
with Reese and Leona.

1:00:40.554 --> 1:00:43.597
It's gonna be a fight with Pruit every day
and over big things.

1:00:43.682 --> 1:00:45.224
I have faith.

1:00:46.101 --> 1:00:47.143
Why?

1:00:52.816 --> 1:00:54.483
There's a hole in the side of the boat.

1:00:55.402 --> 1:00:57.069
That hole is never going to be fixed

1:00:57.154 --> 1:00:59.947
and it's never going away
and you can't get a new boat.

1:01:00.032 --> 1:01:01.073
This is your boat.

1:01:01.533 --> 1:01:06.245
What you have to do
is bail water out faster than it's coming in.

1:01:09.333 --> 1:01:11.417
Also, I have to not die. That's crucial.

1:01:13.045 --> 1:01:14.962
It's always gonna be
something with you, isn't it?

1:01:17.591 --> 1:01:19.342
You know what, kiddo?

1:01:19.426 --> 1:01:23.512
In the old days of about 10 minutes ago,
we did the news well.

1:01:23.597 --> 1:01:27.099
You know how? We just decided to.

1:01:30.896 --> 1:01:32.438
60 seconds.

1:01:43.700 --> 1:01:45.409
Stand by, camera one.

1:01:48.872 --> 1:01:50.998
We've got Julie online.
The shot's clean.

1:01:51.083 --> 1:01:53.376
Tape, cue the VO on A-2 before sound.

1:01:53.460 --> 1:01:57.004
No, I'm saying it wasn't. It wasn't verifiable.

1:02:05.389 --> 1:02:07.181
I appreciate that.

1:02:08.058 --> 1:02:09.266
Don.

1:02:09.976 --> 1:02:11.435
Mandela's been put on life support.

1:02:11.520 --> 1:02:13.771
-Can you put together your notes for me?
-Yeah.

1:02:21.530 --> 1:02:23.030
Military court of appeals ruled that

1:02:23.115 --> 1:02:25.574
he was improperly denied a lawyer
when he was initially questioned.

1:02:25.659 --> 1:02:27.910
That's what I was looking for.

1:02:35.293 --> 1:02:37.545
You know what?
Can we check this number in G4-A?

1:02:37.629 --> 1:02:39.255
I think it's supposed to be 14 million.

1:02:39.339 --> 1:02:41.924
14,000 would be ridiculous.

1:02:42.008 --> 1:02:44.552
Hey, it's Jim in New York. Can you hear me?

1:02:44.803 --> 1:02:48.097
All right, he wants to ask you
about the mood of the leadership, but...

1:02:48.181 --> 1:02:49.390
Mac, they're already walking it back...

1:02:49.474 --> 1:02:51.851
<i>Low interest rates. It's a big part of the story.</i>

1:02:51.935 --> 1:02:54.270
<i>-What are you gonna ask me about?</i>
<i>-Low interest rates.</i>

1:02:54.521 --> 1:02:56.564
-What?
-Low interest rates.

1:02:56.690 --> 1:02:58.858
Do you want a card?
It can be in a special color.

1:02:58.942 --> 1:03:01.026
"The court said that the...

1:03:01.111 --> 1:03:04.113
<i>"That the supporters of Prop 8</i>
<i>had no standing</i>

1:03:04.197 --> 1:03:05.531
"to challenge the lower court."

1:03:05.615 --> 1:03:07.658
"Has no standing"
is how it reads in the ruling.

1:03:07.742 --> 1:03:09.493
That's a legal distinction.

1:03:09.578 --> 1:03:11.287
<i>Yeah, I'm gonna look at it again in the break.</i>

1:03:11.371 --> 1:03:12.788
10 seconds.

1:03:12.873 --> 1:03:15.708
Just those three...
New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania.

1:03:15.792 --> 1:03:18.669
-Good show, everybody.
-Yeah, hang on a second.

1:03:18.753 --> 1:03:21.046
In three, two, roll in.

1:03:37.898 --> 1:03:38.731
Good evening.
