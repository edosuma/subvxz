NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice
system,

00:02.603 --> 00:05.539
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:05.573 --> 00:07.708
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:07.741 --> 00:09.710
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:09.743 --> 00:11.245
are members of an elite squad

00:11.279 --> 00:13.081
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.114 --> 00:15.416
These are their stories.

00:24.358 --> 00:28.496
Suspect turned east
from Columbus onto Nine-Five.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.364
Three-five William
will pick up.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.566
( siren blaring )

00:32.600 --> 00:35.569
I lost him between Columbus
and C-P-W.

00:35.603 --> 00:36.637
( siren wailing )

00:36.670 --> 00:38.072
( tires screeching )

00:41.709 --> 00:43.477
Get him, Sammy, get him!

00:43.511 --> 00:44.712
( barking )

00:48.482 --> 00:49.717
( barking )

00:54.588 --> 00:56.090
( grunts )

00:56.124 --> 00:58.559
( barking )

00:59.627 --> 01:01.595
Get away from me.

01:01.629 --> 01:02.730
( barking continues )

01:02.763 --> 01:03.497
( growls )

01:03.531 --> 01:04.665
Get off me!

01:04.698 --> 01:05.666
( groans )

01:05.699 --> 01:07.335
Out! Out Sammy.

01:07.368 --> 01:08.602
Good girl.
Thanks.

01:08.636 --> 01:09.570
Good girl,
good girl.

01:09.603 --> 01:10.738
( grunts )

01:10.771 --> 01:12.540
I didn't do anything.

01:12.573 --> 01:13.607
What's your name?

01:13.641 --> 01:14.608
Screw you.

01:14.642 --> 01:17.511
Screw You, you're under arrest
for attempted rape

01:17.545 --> 01:19.313
until we nail you
for the other 11.

01:19.347 --> 01:20.614
Prove it.
STABLER:
Does he look

01:20.648 --> 01:21.615
familiar to you?

01:21.649 --> 01:22.683
That's him.
That's the bastard

01:22.716 --> 01:23.684
who tried
to rape me!

01:23.717 --> 01:24.685
BENSON:
See, Screw You?

01:24.718 --> 01:27.388
Wasn't that easy?

01:27.421 --> 01:29.623
OFFICER:
Detectives!

01:29.657 --> 01:30.658
You better come down here.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.560
Sammy found a body.

01:34.862 --> 01:36.830
She's cold.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.832
Been dead for a while.

01:38.866 --> 01:41.735
I'll tape off the street.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.504
Heel.

01:43.537 --> 01:46.407
Looks like he was either trying
to protect her or hide her.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.509
Got a wound to the back
of the head.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.179
No blood on the ground.

01:51.212 --> 01:52.413
Could be a dump job.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.814
Shannon Coyle,

01:53.847 --> 01:55.649
16, from Brooklyn.

01:55.683 --> 01:59.220
Sixth Street in Park Slope.

01:59.253 --> 02:01.889
Logo on the backpack says WTP.

02:01.922 --> 02:04.558
William Theodore Prep's
two blocks from here.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.427
Doesn't look
like a robbery.

02:06.460 --> 02:10.264
There's $70 in the wallet
and a credit card.

02:10.298 --> 02:11.732
This couldn't be our rapist.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.734
Lucky break
the dog found her.

02:13.767 --> 02:16.504
Not too lucky for the parents.

02:16.537 --> 02:17.771
( inhales )

02:17.805 --> 02:21.509
Let's notify them,
get them down to the morgue.

02:21.542 --> 02:23.577
WARNER:
Your victim died of a massive
cerebral hemorrhage,

02:23.611 --> 02:24.778
caused by blunt force trauma.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.079
STABLER:
Time of death?

02:26.113 --> 02:29.417
Based on body temp,
I'd say between 10:00
and 11:00 last night.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.552
And she definitely had sex
before she died.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.287
Found traces
of spermicide.

02:33.321 --> 02:34.455
Rape?

02:34.488 --> 02:35.656
No genital trauma,

02:35.689 --> 02:37.658
but sex and getting
your head bashed in

02:37.691 --> 02:38.826
don't usually go together.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.661
Get in touch
with the parents?

02:40.694 --> 02:41.629
Father's out
of the country.

02:41.662 --> 02:44.632
Mrs. Coyle and
her son, Brian's
right outside.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.334
I'll wheel her
in front of the camera.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.636
She wants
to see her.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.679
Mrs. Coyle, I'm
Detective Stabler,

02:58.712 --> 02:59.780
Detective Benson.

02:59.813 --> 03:00.914
This is
Dr. Warner.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.283
You sure about this?

03:03.384 --> 03:04.818
She's my daughter.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.954
Please.

03:10.424 --> 03:11.592
Oh, God.

03:11.625 --> 03:15.296
( sobbing )

03:15.329 --> 03:17.565
Oh, baby.

03:17.598 --> 03:21.369
Oh, you're so c-cold.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.404
Oh, my sweet baby.

03:24.738 --> 03:27.308
( sobbing )

03:36.650 --> 03:40.921
Captioning sponsored by
UNIVERSAL NETWORK TELEVISION

03:40.954 --> 03:43.691
and NBC

04:23.597 --> 04:25.666
MRS. COYLE:
Shannon always told me
where she was going

04:25.699 --> 04:27.601
and who she was with,
so when I hadn't heard

04:27.635 --> 04:32.706
from her by 9:00, I knew
something was wrong.

04:32.740 --> 04:35.743
I don't know how I'm
going to tell her father.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.446
BENSON:
Is your husband on
a business trip?

04:38.479 --> 04:40.481
For the last two
and a half months.

04:40.514 --> 04:41.815
My husband Barry works

04:41.849 --> 04:43.551
for a French
engineering firm.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.085
They're somewhere
in the Congo

04:45.118 --> 04:46.754
surveying
to build a dam.

04:46.787 --> 04:50.691
Mrs. Coyle, how was
Shannon doing in school?

04:50.724 --> 04:53.627
She was a straight-A student.

04:53.661 --> 04:54.862
( sniffles )

04:54.895 --> 04:58.466
I mean, I think
she cut an occasional class,

04:58.499 --> 04:59.700
but she was never any trouble.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.435
STABLER:
Hey, Brian, was
there anyone

05:01.469 --> 05:02.503
she didn't like?

05:02.536 --> 05:04.004
Uh, someone giving her

05:04.037 --> 05:06.374
a hard time?

05:06.407 --> 05:08.442
If there was,
she would have told me.

05:08.476 --> 05:11.545
Mrs. Coyle, there's evidence

05:11.579 --> 05:14.415
that your daughter had sex
before she died.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.917
She was raped?

05:16.950 --> 05:18.719
STABLER:
Well, we don't
know that for sure,

05:18.752 --> 05:21.021
but we have to consider
all possibilities.

05:21.054 --> 05:21.889
Can you think of anyone

05:21.922 --> 05:23.724
that she may have been
involved with?

05:23.757 --> 05:27.661
If my daughter was having sex,
she would have told me.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.397
BENSON:
And when is

05:29.430 --> 05:30.631
the last time
you heard from her?

05:30.664 --> 05:31.732
2:30 yesterday
afternoon.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.534
She called me
from her cell phone

05:33.567 --> 05:35.403
and said she was going
to be late.

05:35.436 --> 05:38.939
Her choir teacher called
an extra rehearsal.

05:46.514 --> 05:48.382
This is Shannon.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.388
( chatter )

05:54.422 --> 05:55.623
See you later,
Shannon.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.458
Lisa Faber, you just
sang a solo

05:57.491 --> 05:58.291
in the Winter Concert,

05:58.325 --> 06:00.394
and you have a trig
midterm tomorrow.

06:00.428 --> 06:01.895
What are you going
to do now?

06:01.929 --> 06:03.163
Cry.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.499
( laughing )

06:05.533 --> 06:06.600
Hi, Mom.

06:06.634 --> 06:08.502
STABLER:
Reminds me

06:08.536 --> 06:11.038
of Elizabeth's friends,
typical high school kids.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.072
What do you think?

06:12.105 --> 06:13.441
HUANG:
Confident,

06:13.474 --> 06:15.443
good self-esteem,
communicative...

06:15.476 --> 06:17.110
Shannon seems
well adjusted.

06:17.144 --> 06:19.580
In other words, a normal,
healthy teenager.

06:19.613 --> 06:22.049
Computer Crimes get anything
off her hard drive?

06:22.082 --> 06:23.083
BENSON:
It's clean.

06:23.116 --> 06:24.618
There's no visits
to chat rooms,

06:24.652 --> 06:25.653
no suspicious e-mails.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.054
Maybe it was
a random attack.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.055
I doubt it.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.957
Checked the inventory
of Shannon's backpack.

06:29.990 --> 06:30.958
No cell phone.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.092
Perp must've taken it.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.528
He probably thought his number
was stored in the memory.

06:34.562 --> 06:35.429
Which points to
someone she knew.

06:35.463 --> 06:36.630
BENSON:
Warner says that
Shannon had sex,

06:36.664 --> 06:39.800
but the mother and brother
say she wasn't seeing anyone,

06:39.833 --> 06:41.435
which means Mom doesn't know

06:41.469 --> 06:42.870
that Shannon
was sexually active.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.438
Maybe her friends do.

06:44.472 --> 06:47.074
The school is giving us
the cafeteria for interviews.

06:47.107 --> 06:48.476
John, Fin,
see if they can

06:48.509 --> 06:49.977
help us reconstruct
her day.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.111
Shannon
was last seen

06:51.144 --> 06:52.446
at choir practice.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.582
You two start
with the music teacher.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.853
MAN:
Shannon was
the best of the best.

06:59.887 --> 07:02.690
Two years,
never missed a rehearsal.

07:02.723 --> 07:06.193
Beautiful voice,
unlimited potential.

07:06.226 --> 07:09.897
I feel like
I lost my own child.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.865
Do you always rehearse
after school,

07:11.899 --> 07:13.066
Mr. Abruzzo?

07:13.100 --> 07:14.868
Please, call me Steve.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.704
Um, no, not usually,

07:16.737 --> 07:18.205
but the state competition
is just a few weeks away

07:18.238 --> 07:19.973
and we need
extra practice.

07:20.007 --> 07:23.811
Steve, how late did you
keep the kids yesterday?

07:23.844 --> 07:24.745
Till 5:00.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.980
I didn't want their
parents to complain

07:27.014 --> 07:27.915
that they missed dinner.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.217
You have any idea if
Shannon was headed home?

07:30.250 --> 07:32.820
I wish I knew.

07:32.853 --> 07:35.255
Would she know?

07:35.288 --> 07:37.057
That's, um, Lisa Faber.
She might.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.959
She and Shannon
were joined at the hip.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.663
We, uh, we went
for a cup of coffee,

07:42.696 --> 07:44.698
around the corner
after rehearsal.

07:44.732 --> 07:47.100
( crying ):
I'm sorry.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.136
It's okay, Lisa.

07:49.169 --> 07:52.039
What time
did you leave?

07:52.072 --> 07:55.943
Um, like, 6:00,
I think.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.211
And did Shannon say
where she was going?

07:58.245 --> 07:59.580
No,

07:59.613 --> 08:02.716
but I figured home.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.552
Did you see her before choir?

08:04.585 --> 08:07.154
Yeah, I mean, Shannon and I have
two classes together:

08:07.187 --> 08:08.656
American history
and trig.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.157
Seventh
and eighth periods.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.625
And before that?

08:11.659 --> 08:12.793
We had lunch.
Here?

08:12.826 --> 08:13.894
Food here sucks.

08:13.927 --> 08:16.196
We grabbed a couple of slices
at Ray's, up the street.

08:16.229 --> 08:19.099
You walk over together?

08:19.132 --> 08:20.233
No, we met there.

08:20.267 --> 08:21.234
She make it

08:21.268 --> 08:23.270
to her morning classes?

08:23.303 --> 08:25.238
Probably, she
was in homeroom.

08:25.272 --> 08:27.074
STABLER:
You talk to her?

08:27.107 --> 08:29.209
Every day for
the past three years.

08:29.242 --> 08:32.680
My last name's Connor,
hers is Coyle.

08:32.713 --> 08:33.513
She sat behind me.

08:33.547 --> 08:35.215
You know if she was
dating anyone?

08:35.248 --> 08:38.085
She wouldn't talk
to me about that.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.186
Lisa would know.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.689
Shannon wasn't
going out with anyone.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.091
Not that she wasn't asked.
Constantly.

08:44.124 --> 08:47.160
How do you and Shannon
usually get home?

08:47.194 --> 08:49.229
I walk; she takes the subway.

08:49.262 --> 08:53.266
But it was freezing last night,
so she hopped a cab.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.836
STABLER:
Cab companies I talked to

08:55.869 --> 08:58.806
can't find a fare logged from
the coffee shop to Park Slope.

08:58.839 --> 08:59.940
Still looking.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.174
Nobody we've interviewed

09:01.208 --> 09:03.110
saw Shannon
after 6:00 in the evening.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.011
She didn't die
until ten.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.979
That's a lot of hours
unaccounted for.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.080
FIN:
Looking
for you guys.

09:07.114 --> 09:10.050
Just ran every male employee
at William Theodore Prep.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.051
All clean.

09:11.084 --> 09:13.687
Only bump was the choir teacher,
Steven Abruzzo.

09:13.721 --> 09:15.055
What'd
you find out?

09:15.088 --> 09:16.056
He's new on the job.

09:16.089 --> 09:17.290
Just finished a six-year gig

09:17.324 --> 09:18.759
up in Riverdale
at Garfield High.

09:18.792 --> 09:19.760
What happened?

09:19.793 --> 09:20.694
I don't know.

09:20.728 --> 09:23.063
All anyone's saying
is he suddenly quit

09:23.096 --> 09:25.132
at the end
of the last school year.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.867
Go ask Mr. Music why.

09:26.900 --> 09:31.304
* Rejoice and sing

09:31.338 --> 09:35.175
* Your gracious king...

09:35.208 --> 09:37.244
Okay, let's, um,
let's take a break.

09:39.046 --> 09:41.715
Wow, they
sound great.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.316
Yeah, I was going
to cancel practice,

09:43.350 --> 09:44.752
but the kids said Shannon

09:44.785 --> 09:46.286
would have
wanted them to sing.

09:46.319 --> 09:48.722
I think they need an outlet
for their emotions.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.323
Sounds like
you do, too.

09:50.357 --> 09:53.593
We know what happened
at your last school.

09:54.662 --> 09:55.896
Why bring that up?

09:55.929 --> 09:56.930
Well, let's see.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.331
One of your students
is dead,

09:58.365 --> 10:00.000
and apparently you
like younger women.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.001
A lot younger.

10:01.034 --> 10:04.672
That complaint cost me
tenure and a pay raise.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.874
That's a pretty high price
to pay if you're innocent.

10:06.907 --> 10:07.875
Damn right.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.109
It was a load of crap.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.078
Really?

10:11.111 --> 10:13.380
Because that girl said
that you invited her

10:13.413 --> 10:16.383
over to your place for
a "private" voice lesson.

10:16.416 --> 10:19.019
She's a liar, all right?
( cell phone ringing )

10:19.052 --> 10:21.188
Constantly cut class,
I gave her a "D."

10:21.221 --> 10:23.356
This is what I get
for trying to do my job?

10:23.390 --> 10:24.291
Benson.

10:24.324 --> 10:29.797
Look, Detective,
teaching is my life, okay?

10:29.830 --> 10:33.266
I would never do anything
to hurt these kids.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.168
Elliot.

10:35.202 --> 10:37.070
I hope not.

10:40.007 --> 10:42.242
The lab found something
in Shannon's purse.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.915
BENSON:
So what do you got?

10:47.948 --> 10:49.082
Heart-shaped key chain.

10:49.116 --> 10:50.183
With a Super Lock key.

10:50.217 --> 10:51.284
Cost ten bucks
to replace.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.353
It matched the locks
in Shannon's place?

10:53.386 --> 10:55.288
No, but I'm betting
this key to her heart,

10:55.322 --> 10:56.223
opens wherever she got these.

10:56.256 --> 10:58.125
They were tucked in
with the key chain.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.159
Condoms.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.695
So no boyfriend, but she's
ready to have safe sex.

11:01.729 --> 11:03.363
Maybe with the guy's
prints on the wrapper--

11:03.396 --> 11:05.232
right forefinger,
beautiful ten-point match.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.234
In the system?
No rap sheet.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.302
Pre-employment prints
from the Board of Ed.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.070
Some teacher...

11:10.103 --> 11:12.305
Steven Abruzzo.
How'd you know?

11:12.339 --> 11:14.141
I'm a good judge
of character.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.846
What do you know,
a Super Lock.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.380
Let's test our evidence.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.787
( girl moaning )

11:26.820 --> 11:28.021
A school backpack.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.057
What's that sound
like to you?

11:30.090 --> 11:32.159
Statutory rape.

11:36.864 --> 11:37.831
Sorry to interrupt.

11:37.865 --> 11:38.832
Get up, now.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.167
You can't just break in here.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.501
We didn't.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.904
We heard a girl in trouble.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.107
Same brand as Shannon.

11:48.776 --> 11:50.744
Hey, get up.

11:50.778 --> 11:52.913
Get dressed.

11:55.015 --> 11:58.251
Lisa.

12:02.189 --> 12:03.957
You're crazy if you
think I killed Shannon.

12:03.991 --> 12:05.125
You're screwing
one student;

12:05.158 --> 12:06.259
you were screwing
Shannon, too.

12:06.293 --> 12:08.896
You working your way through
the 11th grade there, Steve?

12:08.929 --> 12:10.130
I never slept with her.

12:10.163 --> 12:11.531
I believe him, don't you?

12:11.564 --> 12:13.266
He's probably
passing out condoms

12:13.300 --> 12:14.501
to his female students

12:14.534 --> 12:16.003
so they'll practice
safe sex.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.370
Or maybe Shannon
finds out

12:17.404 --> 12:18.238
you're doing her best friend.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.840
She tells anybody
your career's history.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.842
So I murder her?
Are you insane?

12:21.875 --> 12:25.145
Your career is over
anyway, choir boy.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.480
Lisa's 16.
She's jailbait.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.549
Steve didn't force me to do
anything I didn't want him to.

12:29.582 --> 12:30.417
We're in love.

12:30.450 --> 12:33.120
The law says you
can't consent to sex.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.287
Then I'm not pressing charges.

12:34.321 --> 12:35.422
We'll do that.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.825
But right now Steve's
looking pretty good for murder.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.029
My parents are on vacation.

12:42.062 --> 12:44.064
I spent the night
at Steve's place.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.866
He didn't go near Shannon.

12:45.899 --> 12:47.067
No?

12:47.100 --> 12:51.004
She got these condoms from a box
inside Steve's apartment.

12:51.038 --> 12:54.141
They match the spermicide
that we found in Shannon.

12:54.174 --> 12:57.210
How do you explain that?

12:58.912 --> 13:01.982
I gave Shannon the key
to Steve's apartment.

13:02.015 --> 13:04.217
So she could see her boyfriend.

13:04.251 --> 13:07.054
Their parents said
they couldn't go out,

13:07.087 --> 13:08.989
so they had
to sneak around.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.858
They sneak around last night?

13:10.891 --> 13:12.893
Steve had a meeting.

13:12.926 --> 13:16.363
So we hung out
at his apartment.

13:16.396 --> 13:19.900
They went in the bedroom
for like an hour,

13:19.933 --> 13:21.301
then they left.

13:21.334 --> 13:22.502
Together?

13:22.535 --> 13:23.971
In the same taxi.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.405
Boyfriend's name?

13:28.408 --> 13:29.943
Aidan.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.846
How'd you get past the doorman?

13:32.880 --> 13:35.082
Detective Benson.
This is Detective Stabler.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.416
Is Aidan home?

13:36.449 --> 13:38.351
I'm his mother.
What's this about?

13:38.385 --> 13:41.054
One of his classmates
was murdered.

13:41.088 --> 13:44.257
I heard. It's awful.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.994
Aidan, come to the door.

13:49.062 --> 13:52.132
What's up, Mom?

13:57.670 --> 13:58.972
This is ludicrous.

13:59.006 --> 14:00.307
Our son's not a murderer.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.374
You lied to me.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.076
I had to.

14:03.110 --> 14:05.212
They didn't know Shannon
and I were going out.

14:05.245 --> 14:06.613
Shannon was
your girlfriend?

14:06.646 --> 14:09.016
Even after I told you
to stay away from her?

14:09.049 --> 14:10.017
Debra, now is not the time.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.920
There was nothing wrong
with her like you think.

14:15.088 --> 14:17.024
I didn't kill Shannon.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.125
I loved her.

14:18.158 --> 14:19.993
Aidan, we know
that you two had sex

14:20.027 --> 14:21.328
the night she was murdered.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.330
What in God's name
did you do?!

14:23.363 --> 14:24.631
Debra, please, please.

14:24.664 --> 14:29.002
BENSON:
Where did you go after you left
Mr. Abruzzo's apartment?

14:29.036 --> 14:32.172
We got into a cab.

14:32.205 --> 14:36.343
Shannon was going to Brooklyn,
so we dropped me off first.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.510
What time?

14:37.544 --> 14:39.112
Around 8:30.

14:39.146 --> 14:41.014
The taxi let me off
down the block

14:41.048 --> 14:43.483
from our building so my folks
wouldn't see us.

14:43.516 --> 14:48.221
But Dad was already there,
getting out of another cab.

14:48.255 --> 14:50.123
It's true.
I still have the receipt.

14:50.157 --> 14:51.058
Where were you after that,
Aidan?

14:51.091 --> 14:52.059
DEBRA:
Home. All night.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.126
Ask our doorman.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.328
We're going to need a
DNA sample from your son.

14:55.362 --> 14:57.697
I think we should call a lawyer.

14:57.730 --> 14:58.698
( knocking )

14:58.731 --> 15:00.934
Detectives.

15:03.003 --> 15:04.671
Excuse us.

15:08.275 --> 15:11.444
Fin located Shannon's cabbie,
who said Shannon took a call

15:11.478 --> 15:13.380
right after
they dropped off Aidan.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.249
Then she told the cabbie
to take her to the school.

15:16.283 --> 15:18.218
TARU is dumping
her cell phone.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.419
This can't be good news.

15:19.452 --> 15:23.090
Shannon Coyle was
eight weeks pregnant.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.224
With a girl.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.127
Aidan's got to be the father.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.195
He can't be.

15:28.228 --> 15:29.396
How do you know that?

15:29.429 --> 15:31.098
We haven't taken his DNA.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.032
Don't need it.

15:32.065 --> 15:35.535
All of us get half our DNA
from our mother

15:35.568 --> 15:37.570
and half from our father.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.172
The fetus has 62%

15:39.206 --> 15:41.141
of the same genes
as Shannon.

15:41.174 --> 15:44.311
So she and the baby-/////!s
father are related.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.179
So we're talking about incest.

15:46.213 --> 15:47.214
With who?

15:47.247 --> 15:48.281
Most likely her brother,

15:48.315 --> 15:51.151
but possibly her father,
an uncle or first cousin.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.386
Well, the pregnancy is enough
motive for any one of them

15:53.420 --> 15:54.521
to want to shut Shannon up.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.556
Aidan still could
have killed her.

15:56.589 --> 15:59.626
Until we can prove it, there's
nothing to hold him on.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.494
You better tell
Shannon's mother.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.230
Pregnant?

16:03.263 --> 16:05.132
That can't be true.

16:05.165 --> 16:07.567
Mrs. Coyle,
we understand

16:07.600 --> 16:09.302
how difficult this is.

16:09.336 --> 16:12.505
But the DNA proves that
the baby's father

16:12.539 --> 16:15.275
was related
to Shannon.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.309
What do you mean?

16:16.343 --> 16:18.178
Do you remember
Shannon

16:18.211 --> 16:23.250
spending any time
with uncles or cousins
about two months ago?

16:23.283 --> 16:26.019
No, she doesn't have any uncles
or cousins.

16:26.053 --> 16:27.687
My husband Barry is
an only child.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.290
He's been out of the country
for 11 weeks.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.766
Oh, God...

16:39.799 --> 16:43.303
No...

16:45.238 --> 16:47.640
Brian...

16:47.674 --> 16:49.576
Brian!

16:49.609 --> 16:51.578
Did you get Shannon pregnant?

16:51.611 --> 16:53.280
Tell me what you did.

16:53.313 --> 16:54.281
You tell me!

16:54.314 --> 16:54.981
I didn't do anything!

16:55.014 --> 16:56.449
Did you get
her pregnant?!

16:56.483 --> 16:58.285
Tell me if you
got her pregnant!

16:58.318 --> 16:59.152
Mrs. Coyle.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.420
Mrs. Coyle,
calm down.

17:00.453 --> 17:01.754
Come down the stairs.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.290
Mom, I never
touched her.

17:03.323 --> 17:04.324
Shut up!

17:04.357 --> 17:05.258
You shut up!

17:05.292 --> 17:07.460
Brian, you're going
to have to come with us.

17:07.494 --> 17:09.329
Mrs. Coyle, we need
your permission

17:09.362 --> 17:10.597
to test your son's DNA.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.499
Do whatever you want with him.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.301
Come on.

17:20.273 --> 17:22.709
I was home
the night Shannon died.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.444
My mom will tell you.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.579
I'm sure she will.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.348
I didn't kill
my sister, okay?

17:28.381 --> 17:29.582
Okay.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.151
I never slept with her.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.785
Brian, I know
how tough it is.

17:32.819 --> 17:34.421
You accidentally
see Shannon

17:34.454 --> 17:37.457
coming out of the shower,
undressing in her room...

17:37.490 --> 17:38.558
You're sick.

17:38.591 --> 17:39.592
Looks good like
all the girls...

17:39.626 --> 17:40.593
That's disgusting. Stop!

17:40.627 --> 17:41.594
You couldn't help
yourself.

17:41.628 --> 17:42.495
Stop! I never touched Shannon!

17:42.529 --> 17:46.599
How could I be the father
of her baby?

17:47.634 --> 17:49.802
Okay, what about your dad?

17:49.836 --> 17:52.239
You sure he's out of town?

17:52.272 --> 17:54.274
Why would he come back
and not tell us?

17:54.307 --> 17:57.610
We can't even have Shannon's
funeral until he gets here.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.582
Barry Coyle's company confirms

18:02.615 --> 18:04.484
that he's been
working in Africa.

18:04.517 --> 18:06.186
So Brian is the only one

18:06.219 --> 18:08.288
who could have impregnated
his sister.

18:08.321 --> 18:11.191
Elliot's got him
at the M.E. for a DNA test.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.260
No arrest until
we get the results.

18:13.293 --> 18:14.827
He may have killed Shannon...

18:14.861 --> 18:16.363
Just because
he slept with her?

18:16.396 --> 18:18.298
I can't take that
to the Grand Jury.

18:18.331 --> 18:19.366
Susan Coyle called.

18:19.399 --> 18:20.533
She said she lost her head

18:20.567 --> 18:22.802
when she tried to beat
the crap out of Brian.

18:22.835 --> 18:25.272
I'm not sure I would have
reacted any different.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.240
Is there any history
of previous abuse?

18:27.274 --> 18:28.241
Neighbors never
even heard

18:28.275 --> 18:29.142
them talk loud.

18:29.176 --> 18:31.311
They say that Susan
keeps to herself.

18:31.344 --> 18:32.445
She lives for those kids.

18:32.479 --> 18:33.580
What does Brian say?

18:33.613 --> 18:34.714
He wants to go home.

18:34.747 --> 18:35.782
Then cut him loose.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.284
He's not the only suspect.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.152
We know where Aidan and Brian

18:39.186 --> 18:40.387
were the night
of the murder?

18:40.420 --> 18:42.422
Their parents alibi
for both of them.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.291
But parents cover
for their kids.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.426
Let's find out who's lying.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.460
Start with the Connors.

18:47.494 --> 18:50.497
And ask them why they didn't
want Romeo and Juliet

18:50.530 --> 18:51.698
to see each other.

18:56.336 --> 18:57.504
Sweetheart, I expect
a phone call

18:57.537 --> 18:59.306
when you're through
with study group.

18:59.339 --> 19:00.440
Bye, Mom.
Bye, Dad.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.909
We wouldn't lie
to you, Detectives.

19:02.942 --> 19:04.544
Aidan was here
all night.

19:04.577 --> 19:07.747
Mrs. Conner, why didn't
you want your son Aidan

19:07.780 --> 19:10.383
to go out
with Shannon?

19:10.417 --> 19:13.253
Because of her mother.

19:13.286 --> 19:15.755
Look, I've known Susan since
our kids started kindergarten.

19:15.788 --> 19:16.789
We used to be friends.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.391
What happened?

19:18.425 --> 19:19.892
I kept asking her

19:19.926 --> 19:22.195
when we were going
to go out together.

19:22.229 --> 19:24.197
You know, like
civilized couples do.

19:24.231 --> 19:26.966
She kept making excuses
about her husband being away.

19:26.999 --> 19:30.703
I finally realized, they thought
they were too good for us.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.872
You mean we were
too good for them.

19:35.542 --> 19:39.679
Look, I'm really sorry about
what happened to Shannon,

19:39.712 --> 19:42.349
but my Aidan
can do much better.

19:42.382 --> 19:43.683
Jason?

19:43.716 --> 19:44.984
It's a Maggie Norris.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.319
What do you think?

19:46.353 --> 19:48.388
Magnificent. How many more?

19:48.421 --> 19:50.557
Just the Dior.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.625
Oh, be a dear and stop
at the vault

19:52.659 --> 19:54.627
and pick up my diamonds
tomorrow.

19:59.031 --> 20:02.402
We're hosting the Manhattan
Hospital Benefit tomorrow night.

20:02.435 --> 20:03.870
I have to apologize
for my wife.

20:03.903 --> 20:04.771
She's a bit of snob.

20:04.804 --> 20:07.474
You don't agree with
her about the Coyles?

20:07.507 --> 20:10.410
Barry Coyle's donated a lot of
money to William Theodore Prep.

20:10.443 --> 20:11.544
So you've met him.

20:11.578 --> 20:12.812
Sure.
Played golf with him

20:12.845 --> 20:14.447
a few times.

20:14.481 --> 20:16.383
My wife would kill me
if she found out.

20:16.416 --> 20:18.451
I'm a developer;
he's an engineer.

20:18.485 --> 20:19.852
We had plenty to talk about.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.755
He's a very down-to-earth guy,
really into his kids.

20:22.789 --> 20:23.756
( phone ringing )

20:23.790 --> 20:25.592
Did you ever
meet Shannon?

20:25.625 --> 20:27.494
I've met all of Aidan's friends.

20:27.527 --> 20:29.496
But you didn't know
that they were dating?

20:29.529 --> 20:30.630
No, but I know my son.

20:30.663 --> 20:34.033
Forget killing his girlfriend;
he wouldn't hurt a fly.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.668
STABLER:
Well, thanks
for everything.

20:35.702 --> 20:38.271
We'll be in touch.

20:39.372 --> 20:41.874
TARU got the dump
on Shannon's cell phone.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.510
Munch and Fin are on it.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.382
It's just like the mother
told you--

20:49.416 --> 20:50.850
Shannon called home
from her cell at 2:31

20:50.883 --> 20:52.319
the afternoon
she was murdered.

20:52.352 --> 20:53.886
Then Shannon's
at school until 5:00.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.389
She has coffee with her
friend Lisa until 6:00.

20:56.423 --> 20:59.326
Back to the teacher's place
for a little loving with Aidan.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.994
They leave at 8:00, drop Aidan
off on the corner at 8:30.

21:02.028 --> 21:04.597
Right, then the cab
takes her back
to school at 8:30.

21:04.631 --> 21:05.798
When was that last call?

21:05.832 --> 21:08.635
8:34. Incoming to Shannon's
phone from a blocked number.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.437
You able to un-block it?

21:10.470 --> 21:11.938
Traced it to a cell phone.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.540
Billed to one Jason Connor.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.875
Aidan called Shannon back.
They go out again.

21:15.908 --> 21:17.744
Which makes him the last one
to talk to her

21:17.777 --> 21:18.745
before she was killed.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.647
Better take this.

21:24.984 --> 21:27.487
Sector car responded
to a call for shots fired.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.622
Found him all bloodied up
in the driver's seat,

21:29.656 --> 21:31.424
What the hell was
he was doing here?

21:31.458 --> 21:32.625
Working.

21:32.659 --> 21:36.062
That's his latest construction
project across the street.

21:36.095 --> 21:39.432
.25-caliber Beretta Jet Fire.
CSU found it under the car.

21:39.466 --> 21:41.000
Already dusted, no prints.

21:41.033 --> 21:44.837
Whoever did it wanted to make
sure Jason Conner was dead.

21:44.871 --> 21:47.039
Emptied the whole clip into him.

21:54.514 --> 21:55.515
First Shannon is killed,
now her boyfriend's father.

21:56.783 --> 21:58.084
Why?

21:58.117 --> 21:59.719
The night of Shannon's murder,

21:59.752 --> 22:02.989
Jason Connor saw Shannon
and Aidan in a taxi together.

22:03.022 --> 22:04.791
I think that Aidan Connor

22:04.824 --> 22:06.793
murdered Shannon
and then his father.

22:06.826 --> 22:07.660
How do you figure?

22:07.694 --> 22:09.862
Aidan finds out
that Shannon's pregnant.

22:09.896 --> 22:11.764
He knows he used condoms
when they had sex.

22:11.798 --> 22:13.099
He thinks that Shannon
cheated on him.

22:13.132 --> 22:14.534
Tragedy is, it was
with her brother.

22:14.567 --> 22:15.735
But Aidan
didn't know that.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.804
He kills Shannon,
then he realizes

22:17.837 --> 22:20.106
the last person to see them
together was his father.

22:20.139 --> 22:21.808
( telephone rings )
Murder your father

22:21.841 --> 22:23.643
to cover up killing
your girlfriend?

22:23.676 --> 22:25.412
That's cold.

22:25.445 --> 22:27.647
Kid doesn't strike me
as a sociopath.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.081
Captain,
this kid has lied to us

22:29.115 --> 22:31.083
every single time
we've talked to him.

22:31.117 --> 22:32.519
You want us to
bring Aidan in?

22:32.552 --> 22:33.820
Mother's just gonna
lawyer him up.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.922
Especially now that Dad's dead.

22:35.955 --> 22:36.923
Ballistics traced the gun.

22:36.956 --> 22:41.428
Bought in Pennsylvania in 1985
by Jason Connor.

22:41.461 --> 22:42.795
That narrows down
our suspect pool.

22:42.829 --> 22:44.130
Yeah, to Aidan.

22:44.163 --> 22:45.932
Better not jump to conclusions.

22:45.965 --> 22:49.836
Gun's registered to Susan Coyle.

22:49.869 --> 22:52.705
( doorbell rings )

22:53.906 --> 22:55.074
How many times
you gonna knock?

22:55.107 --> 22:56.576
Let's talk to a neighbor.

22:56.609 --> 22:57.577
Can I help you?

22:57.610 --> 22:58.445
Police.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.847
We're looking for
Susan and Brian Coyle.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.615
They left early this morning.

23:02.649 --> 23:05.518
Woke me out of a deep sleep
putting a bunch of suitcases

23:05.552 --> 23:06.819
into the trunk
of their car.

23:06.853 --> 23:08.054
She say where
they were going?

23:08.087 --> 23:10.423
Greensburgh,
Pennsylvania.

23:10.457 --> 23:11.924
Wish they were having
it here, though.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.526
Having what here?

23:13.560 --> 23:15.828
Shannon's funeral.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.864
She was a sweet girl.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.098
Thank you.

23:20.166 --> 23:21.768
It's pretty hard
to have a funeral

23:21.801 --> 23:23.836
when the M.E. hasn't released
Shannon's body yet.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.838
Why would Susan be running
if she didn't murder Jason?

23:25.872 --> 23:28.107
What was she doing
with his gun?

23:28.140 --> 23:29.509
Maybe they knew each other

23:29.542 --> 23:30.943
a lot better
than Jason let on.

23:30.977 --> 23:33.212
Having an affair?

23:33.245 --> 23:34.814
Susan Coyle and Jason Connor

23:34.847 --> 23:36.783
were definitely
having an affair.

23:36.816 --> 23:37.884
How do you know that?

23:37.917 --> 23:40.086
I'll show you.

23:40.119 --> 23:41.921
Coyle family tree.

23:41.954 --> 23:44.056
We call it a genotype.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.192
We know Shannon's fetus
should have had

23:46.225 --> 23:49.095
half its genes from Shannon
and half from the father.

23:49.128 --> 23:52.699
I re-tested the DNA just in case
the samples were contaminated.

23:52.732 --> 23:54.066
Got the same results.

23:54.100 --> 23:59.138
The fetus has 62-percent
of Shannon's genes.

23:59.171 --> 24:00.973
So it was incest.
Yes.

24:01.007 --> 24:02.809
But her brother Brian's
not a match.

24:02.842 --> 24:04.477
And we know that
Shannon's father Barry

24:04.511 --> 24:06.012
was gone for more
than eight weeks,

24:06.045 --> 24:07.146
so it couldn't have been him.

24:07.179 --> 24:08.781
So who got Shannon pregnant?

24:08.815 --> 24:10.016
At first I thought
there was

24:10.049 --> 24:11.250
another sibling
we didn't know about.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.085
Or her family lied about
no uncles or cousins.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.722
We checked,
we couldn't find any.

24:15.755 --> 24:17.123
Then there's only
one other option.

24:17.156 --> 24:19.158
The fetus has
a double grandparent.

24:19.191 --> 24:20.993
What the hell does that mean?

24:21.027 --> 24:21.928
The DNA confirms it.

24:21.961 --> 24:24.797
Shannon and the guy
who impregnated her

24:24.831 --> 24:28.935
have the same father.

24:28.968 --> 24:32.104
Jason Connor and Barry Coyle
are the same person.

24:32.138 --> 24:37.877
Which means that Aidan Connor
is the father of Shannon's baby.

24:42.081 --> 24:44.116
DEBRA:
It all makes sense now.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.252
Jason's behavior.

24:46.285 --> 24:50.923
All those trips out of town
to "manage his projects."

24:50.957 --> 24:53.125
Why Susan never wanted us
to meet Barry.

24:53.159 --> 24:55.762
He was a fraud.
He didn't exist.

24:55.795 --> 24:58.731
You're sure Aidan didn't know?

25:02.769 --> 25:06.272
I'm not sure of anything now.

25:06.305 --> 25:09.041
We have to tell him.

25:09.075 --> 25:10.743
No, please.

25:10.777 --> 25:14.246
He's a good boy.

25:14.280 --> 25:19.986
First his girlfriend gets
murdered, then his father.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.855
I don't think
he can handle any more.

25:22.889 --> 25:25.224
I'm sorry.

25:25.257 --> 25:28.194
But we have to find out
who killed your husband.

25:35.802 --> 25:37.336
Where's my mom?

25:37.369 --> 25:40.006
With my boss.

25:40.039 --> 25:43.042
You and I,
we got to talk privately.

25:43.075 --> 25:46.646
Look, I told you
I didn't kill Shannon.

25:46.679 --> 25:50.182
I believe you.

25:50.216 --> 25:52.652
There's something
you need to know.

25:52.685 --> 25:53.853
About what?

25:53.886 --> 25:55.588
Your father.

25:55.622 --> 25:56.956
You know who shot him?

25:56.989 --> 26:00.292
We're investigating.

26:00.326 --> 26:02.228
I know how much
you loved your dad.

26:02.261 --> 26:05.164
So what I'm about
to tell you

26:05.197 --> 26:09.135
is not gonna be
easy to understand.

26:09.168 --> 26:11.938
Did he do something wrong?

26:14.674 --> 26:19.879
Aidan, your father...
was also Shannon's father.

26:27.186 --> 26:29.656
Shannon's not my sister.

26:29.689 --> 26:32.024
Her DNA tests prove she is.

26:37.129 --> 26:38.965
How can you know this?

26:42.101 --> 26:44.737
Because Shannon was pregnant.

26:44.771 --> 26:50.009
And we tested the
fetus's genes.

26:50.042 --> 26:54.781
The fetus?

26:54.814 --> 26:56.883
Oh, God.

26:56.916 --> 26:58.084
Listen to me,
this is not your fault.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.152
No.
None of this
is your fault.

27:00.186 --> 27:02.021
No...

27:02.054 --> 27:06.225
She was my sister?

27:06.258 --> 27:09.161
( sobs )

27:09.195 --> 27:15.835
I had sex with my sister?

27:15.868 --> 27:17.737
( retches )

27:20.006 --> 27:21.240
( coughs )

27:28.447 --> 27:31.183
It's not true!

27:33.285 --> 27:35.988
( sobs )

27:38.725 --> 27:41.160
( sobbing ):
It's not...

27:44.030 --> 27:47.099
He couldn't fake that kind
of physical reaction.

27:47.133 --> 27:49.936
This kid didn't kill anyone.

27:49.969 --> 27:52.939
Susan and Brian Coyle just
turned up south of Montreal.

27:52.972 --> 27:54.240
State Police stopped them

27:54.273 --> 27:55.274
from crossing
into Canada.

27:55.307 --> 27:57.243
Bring them back.

28:03.149 --> 28:04.183
Where's Brian?

28:04.216 --> 28:05.417
He's down the hall.

28:05.451 --> 28:07.153
We have done nothing wrong.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.221
Why are you taking us
back to New York?

28:09.255 --> 28:11.791
You're under arrest for murder.

28:11.824 --> 28:15.261
You think I killed
my own daughter?

28:15.294 --> 28:17.363
Not Shannon.

28:17.396 --> 28:19.899
Her father, Jason Connor.

28:19.932 --> 28:23.369
What?

28:26.238 --> 28:29.241
Jason's dead?

28:44.090 --> 28:44.523
I didn't kill Jason.

28:45.224 --> 28:46.492
He was shot with
your gun, Susan.

28:46.525 --> 28:47.927
No, you've got this
all wrong.

28:47.960 --> 28:48.895
Really?

28:48.928 --> 28:50.529
Now are you gonna put on
another performance

28:50.562 --> 28:53.032
like you did when you slapped
your son around?

28:53.065 --> 28:54.867
I knew Brian
didn't hurt Shannon.

28:54.901 --> 28:55.734
That's true.

28:55.768 --> 28:57.536
I was just trying
to protect Jason.

28:57.569 --> 29:00.239
Why would you protect the man
who murdered your daughter?

29:00.272 --> 29:03.142
He didn't murder Shannon.
It was an accident.

29:03.175 --> 29:06.312
You knew what happened
all along.

29:06.345 --> 29:09.548
From the first time
we talked to you.

29:09.581 --> 29:13.786
I suggest you start
telling the truth.

29:13.820 --> 29:16.355
Jason called Shannon
after they saw each other,

29:16.388 --> 29:19.992
and they met a couple of blocks
from the school.

29:20.026 --> 29:26.032
When Jason told Shannon, Aidan
was her brother, she fell apart.

29:26.065 --> 29:29.235
She told him she was pregnant.

29:29.268 --> 29:32.071
Jason begged Shannon
to forgive him.

29:32.104 --> 29:34.340
She pushed him away.

29:34.373 --> 29:37.476
She slipped and fell backwards
and hit her head.

29:37.509 --> 29:40.212
Jason tried to revive her,
but it was too late.

29:40.246 --> 29:41.480
She was gone.

29:41.513 --> 29:42.982
So he left her in an alley.

29:43.015 --> 29:44.450
Jason was confused.

29:44.483 --> 29:46.118
He didn't know what to do.

29:46.152 --> 29:49.188
And you bought his story.

29:49.221 --> 29:51.323
You're telling me
that you don't blame Jason

29:51.357 --> 29:53.092
for your daughter's death?

29:53.125 --> 29:55.061
Would I blame him
if he was with Shannon

29:55.094 --> 29:56.262
and she got hit by a car?

29:56.295 --> 29:57.830
Of course not.

29:57.864 --> 29:59.498
Jason would give up
everything he had

29:59.531 --> 30:01.067
before he'd hurt Shannon.

30:03.102 --> 30:05.137
When did Jason tell you this?

30:05.171 --> 30:10.109
The night it happened.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.278
He came to me
after Brian was asleep.

30:12.311 --> 30:13.579
He was devastated,

30:13.612 --> 30:15.214
crying.

30:15.247 --> 30:17.984
He said he was finally
going to leave his wife.

30:18.017 --> 30:22.021
He told me I should take Brian
and drive up to Montreal,

30:22.054 --> 30:23.489
catch a plane to Cuba.

30:23.522 --> 30:26.125
That he would meet us
in Havana in a few days.

30:26.158 --> 30:29.228
Susan...

30:29.261 --> 30:31.864
your daughter is dead.

30:36.568 --> 30:41.573
Nothing's going
to bring Shannon back.

30:41.607 --> 30:44.210
Why would I kill him?

30:48.380 --> 30:50.016
STABLER:
We found the real Barry Coyle

30:50.049 --> 30:52.484
living outside St. Louis
with his wife and two kids.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.987
Susan tells us that
Jason stole his name
and profession

30:55.021 --> 30:57.389
from an engineering directory
from the public library.

30:57.423 --> 30:58.457
What about Susan's
travel plans?

30:58.490 --> 31:00.960
We found Brian and Susan's
plane tickets to Cuba.

31:00.993 --> 31:02.061
But not Jason's.

31:02.094 --> 31:03.562
There's no evidence
he ever intended

31:03.595 --> 31:04.663
to go down there
and meet them.

31:04.696 --> 31:05.898
If he backed out,

31:05.932 --> 31:07.934
could be why
Susan killed him.

31:07.967 --> 31:08.867
I'd say that's a good bet.

31:08.901 --> 31:11.971
Debra Connor brought
some show-and-tell.

31:15.507 --> 31:18.677
Mrs. Connor,
can I help you?

31:18.710 --> 31:21.113
I'm here to help you.

31:21.147 --> 31:22.581
What are these?

31:22.614 --> 31:24.550
My diamonds.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.018
They were in my
safe-deposit box

31:26.052 --> 31:29.922
until they were stolen
two days ago.

31:29.956 --> 31:32.024
Susan Coyle?

31:32.058 --> 31:34.660
How'd she get in your vault?

31:34.693 --> 31:38.530
She had ID in my name,
and she forged my signature.

31:38.564 --> 31:40.332
I never went to that bank.

31:40.366 --> 31:42.168
Jason always took care
of our finances.

31:42.201 --> 31:45.371
How much was the jewelry worth?

31:45.404 --> 31:48.540
Over two million dollars.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.342
She cleaned me out.

31:50.376 --> 31:52.945
STABLER:
Thank you.

31:54.113 --> 31:55.214
Susan stole the diamonds,

31:55.247 --> 31:56.983
she had the gun,
she had the motive.

31:57.016 --> 31:59.118
I have all I need
for an indictment.

32:02.354 --> 32:04.290
DEBRA:
The bank called me.

32:04.323 --> 32:07.093
Said I'd forgotten my sunglasses
the previous day.

32:07.126 --> 32:11.330
I said that was impossible
because I'd never been there.

32:11.363 --> 32:14.400
That's when I learned
I'd been robbed.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.602
How long were you married
to Jason, Mrs. Connor?

32:16.635 --> 32:18.537
26 years.

32:18.570 --> 32:21.340
Did you have any inkling
he was planning to leave you?

32:21.373 --> 32:23.109
No. Quite
the opposite.

32:23.142 --> 32:25.277
We were planning
a benefit dinner

32:25.311 --> 32:27.313
the night after
he was murdered.

32:27.346 --> 32:30.416
He'd asked me to make sure
his tux was pressed.

32:30.449 --> 32:31.717
NOVAK:
Thank you.

32:31.750 --> 32:33.952
Your witness.

32:35.687 --> 32:38.024
All those years
and you never knew

32:38.057 --> 32:39.758
your husband had
a second family?

32:39.791 --> 32:42.261
No. I trusted him.

32:42.294 --> 32:45.431
Obviously that trust
was misplaced.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.133
With all due respect,
Mrs. Connor,

32:47.166 --> 32:49.068
you must feel like the stupidest
woman on the planet.

32:49.101 --> 32:50.636
Objection.
Is there a question?

32:50.669 --> 32:51.737
I'll withdraw.

32:51.770 --> 32:54.073
Mrs. Connor,
do you own a handgun?

32:54.106 --> 32:55.474
No.

32:55.507 --> 32:57.109
Did your husband?

32:57.143 --> 32:59.645
He said he did.

32:59.678 --> 33:02.648
Are you saying you never saw it?

33:02.681 --> 33:04.716
Yes. I'm saying
I never saw it.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.452
Do you know where he kept it?

33:06.485 --> 33:10.022
No, I do not.
Nor do I want to.

33:10.056 --> 33:12.091
I don't like guns.

33:15.161 --> 33:16.795
It started out as an affair,

33:16.828 --> 33:19.398
but then I found out
I was pregnant with Shannon.

33:19.431 --> 33:22.401
And what did Jason say
when he found out?

33:22.434 --> 33:24.336
That children needed a father

33:24.370 --> 33:28.107
and he would be there
no matter what.

33:28.140 --> 33:29.341
He was good
to his word.

33:29.375 --> 33:30.809
But he wouldn't leave
his wife for you.

33:30.842 --> 33:33.112
Didn't you ever want
to break it off?

33:33.145 --> 33:34.113
Yes.

33:34.146 --> 33:35.114
But you didn't.

33:35.147 --> 33:37.149
Because you were
dependent on him?

33:37.183 --> 33:39.418
And because I loved him.

33:39.451 --> 33:41.753
And because he loved
Brian and Shannon.

33:41.787 --> 33:45.691
He tried to be as much
of a father as he could.

33:45.724 --> 33:47.593
He provided for them.

33:47.626 --> 33:49.695
Staying with Jason
was the only way

33:49.728 --> 33:50.796
I could protect my kids.

33:50.829 --> 33:52.731
When Jason told you

33:52.764 --> 33:54.133
to meet him in Havana,

33:54.166 --> 33:55.134
did he give you money?

33:55.167 --> 33:57.536
No. But he did
give me his key

33:57.569 --> 33:59.771
to the safe deposit box.

33:59.805 --> 34:01.140
I was only doing

34:01.173 --> 34:02.141
what he told me to.

34:02.174 --> 34:03.309
Objection. Hearsay.

34:03.342 --> 34:05.577
Sustained.

34:05.611 --> 34:07.646
Thank you.

34:07.679 --> 34:09.381
Nothing further.

34:09.415 --> 34:10.382
Did he give you the key

34:10.416 --> 34:12.551
or did you take it from him
after you shot him?

34:12.584 --> 34:14.286
Objection.
Withdrawn.

34:15.621 --> 34:17.423
Ms. Coyle,

34:17.456 --> 34:19.825
it was really you
who forbade Shannon

34:19.858 --> 34:21.127
from seeing Aidan,
wasn't it?

34:21.160 --> 34:22.728
No, Debra Connor did, too.

34:22.761 --> 34:23.695
Because she didn't think

34:23.729 --> 34:26.298
that your daughter was
good enough for her son.

34:26.332 --> 34:28.367
But you didn't want them
to have a relationship

34:28.400 --> 34:31.737
because you knew it would put
Jason's secret in jeopardy,

34:31.770 --> 34:35.207
isn't that right?

34:35.241 --> 34:36.708
Yes.

34:38.677 --> 34:42.148
People's two, Your Honor.

34:42.181 --> 34:44.116
Do you recognize this?

34:44.150 --> 34:46.252
Yes.

34:46.285 --> 34:49.621
We've heard testimony
that this weapon was used

34:49.655 --> 34:52.491
to murder Jason Connor.

34:52.524 --> 34:54.126
Do you happen to know

34:54.160 --> 34:55.527
in whose name
it's registered?

34:55.561 --> 34:59.665
My name.

34:59.698 --> 35:03.169
No further questions.

35:03.202 --> 35:05.804
Re-direct, Your Honor.

35:05.837 --> 35:08.874
When was the last time
you saw this gun?

35:08.907 --> 35:09.808
Approximately 15 years ago.

35:09.841 --> 35:11.777
I told Jason to get it
out of the house.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.245
Why was that?

35:13.279 --> 35:14.513
Shannon was a toddler

35:14.546 --> 35:15.747
and I didn't
feel safe

35:15.781 --> 35:17.683
having a gun with
children around.

35:17.716 --> 35:19.685
Do you know
what happened to it?

35:19.718 --> 35:23.922
No. I never saw it again.

35:23.955 --> 35:26.658
The gun was Susan's,
but she didn't have it
in her possession.

35:26.692 --> 35:27.759
Right.

35:27.793 --> 35:28.827
I wouldn't worry about it.

35:28.860 --> 35:31.263
All this jury's heard
is how Susan's lived a lie

35:31.297 --> 35:32.298
for the last 20 years.

35:32.331 --> 35:33.632
They can't stand her.

35:33.665 --> 35:34.666
Elliot.

35:36.302 --> 35:37.536
Aidan.

35:40.739 --> 35:42.908
Can I talk to you alone?

35:42.941 --> 35:46.445
Yeah, what's up?

35:46.478 --> 35:49.215
Susan's telling the truth.

35:49.248 --> 35:49.948
About what?

35:49.981 --> 35:52.918
The gun that killed my father.

35:52.951 --> 35:55.187
It was in our house.

36:00.226 --> 36:02.894
Aidan, what are
you saying to me?

36:02.928 --> 36:08.567
Susan didn't kill
my dad, I did.

36:08.600 --> 36:11.837
Dad kept the gun
in his underwear drawer.

36:11.870 --> 36:13.972
Susan's lawyer was right.

36:14.005 --> 36:16.342
I knew Dad killed Shannon.

36:16.375 --> 36:17.976
Okay, but I want you to
tell me what happened

36:18.009 --> 36:19.811
with you and your dad.

36:19.845 --> 36:23.249
I got the gun,
I went to his office.

36:23.282 --> 36:24.916
He was leaving.

36:24.950 --> 36:27.719
I got in his car
I and shot him.

36:34.626 --> 36:36.328
Just like that, huh?

36:36.362 --> 36:38.230
Are you going to arrest me now?

36:38.264 --> 36:40.966
Aidan, why are
you doing this?

36:40.999 --> 36:43.535
Because I'm guilty.

36:45.304 --> 36:48.507
His confession's not real,
but his guilt sure is.

36:48.540 --> 36:49.775
Because of the incest.

36:49.808 --> 36:52.944
Tell him he's not to blame; it's
not gonna change what happened.

36:52.978 --> 36:55.013
Why admit to something
he didn't do?

36:55.046 --> 36:57.883
To punish himself for
sleeping with his sister.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.017
But what about his mother?

36:59.050 --> 37:01.287
Aidan going away for
life would kill her.

37:01.320 --> 37:03.489
Is he trying
to punish her, too?

37:03.522 --> 37:06.958
No. But I think
I know what he is doing.

37:10.829 --> 37:13.765
They can't prove
I didn't do it.

37:13.799 --> 37:17.569
You said in court
you were disgusted.

37:17.603 --> 37:23.309
Did you mean with yourself?

37:23.342 --> 37:27.779
When I found out that
Shannon was dead,

37:27.813 --> 37:32.584
I didn't know what
I was going to do.

37:32.618 --> 37:34.386
We had so much fun
together, you know?

37:34.420 --> 37:39.291
We could talk
like grown-ups.

37:39.325 --> 37:42.027
We loved each other.

37:42.060 --> 37:43.729
And then I found out

37:43.762 --> 37:47.065
who Shannon really was...

37:47.098 --> 37:53.339
and I feel like I ruined her.

37:53.372 --> 38:02.047
And now I can't even tell her
how sorry I am for what I did.

38:02.080 --> 38:07.419
I wish I had just used
my father's gun on myself.

38:14.493 --> 38:17.629
Please... stop him.
He's lying.

38:17.663 --> 38:19.765
How do you know?

38:25.571 --> 38:29.775
After the bank called,
and I saw the photo of Susan,

38:29.808 --> 38:33.445
I realized that he
was leaving me for her.

38:33.479 --> 38:35.381
And, uh...

38:35.414 --> 38:37.048
then I found
the plane ticket to Cuba

38:37.082 --> 38:41.387
and I canceled it.

38:41.420 --> 38:42.521
I knew where
his gun was.

38:44.990 --> 38:50.529
I got it and I went
to his office to confront him.

38:50.562 --> 38:55.767
He was just leaving
the parking garage

38:55.801 --> 38:59.671
and he pulled over
to meet me.

38:59.705 --> 39:02.374
And then he told
me everything.

39:02.408 --> 39:07.379
What happened to Shannon...

39:07.413 --> 39:11.082
that she was his daughter.

39:11.116 --> 39:13.419
And I knew it.

39:13.452 --> 39:20.392
My son had slept
with his own sister.

39:20.426 --> 39:26.097
And I started shooting
and I couldn't stop myself.

39:30.135 --> 39:32.638
He destroyed Aidan's life.

39:32.671 --> 39:36.074
But I don't want Aidan
to go to prison

39:36.107 --> 39:37.909
for something that I did.

39:40.779 --> 39:43.882
You have the right
to remain silent, Mrs. Connor.

39:43.915 --> 39:46.117
You have the right
to an attorney.

39:46.151 --> 39:48.720
I don't want an attorney.

39:48.754 --> 39:54.526
All I want is to help my son.

39:54.560 --> 39:57.896
Can't you see how he's hurting?

39:57.929 --> 40:03.435
Please... please, just help him.

40:08.607 --> 40:10.742
Can I see my mom now?

40:10.776 --> 40:14.112
As soon as we're done
booking her.

40:18.016 --> 40:19.485
She's under arrest?

40:19.518 --> 40:23.489
For murdering
your father, yeah.

40:23.522 --> 40:25.924
When did you know?

40:25.957 --> 40:29.828
In court.

40:29.861 --> 40:34.633
She lied when she said
she never saw the gun.

40:37.769 --> 40:43.809
Shannon's gone; Dad's gone;
Mom's going to prison.

40:43.842 --> 40:45.611
( sighs ):
I have no one left.

40:45.644 --> 40:50.215
Aidan, listen to me.

40:50.248 --> 40:52.484
You didn't cause any of this.

40:52.518 --> 40:55.253
You, Shannon, Brian,
every one of you

40:55.286 --> 40:58.156
were just born
into this mess.

40:58.189 --> 41:00.191
But you've to get
through this.

41:00.225 --> 41:03.962
Not only for your sake,
but for your brother's.

41:06.932 --> 41:07.999
My brother?
