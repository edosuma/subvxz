â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

00:03.938 --> 00:05.771
(sighs)

00:05.773 --> 00:06.939
I can't believe it.

00:06.941 --> 00:08.540
I know.

00:08.542 --> 00:11.610
Since you let me do it to you,
I had to let you do it to me.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.012
Not that.

00:13.014 --> 00:15.781
Although, remind me
to throw away that cat toy.

00:15.783 --> 00:18.350
No, I meant the fact
that you are cheating

00:18.352 --> 00:21.120
On your husband to sleep
with your social worker.

00:21.122 --> 00:23.422
You just described a fantasy
I didn't know I had.

00:24.958 --> 00:27.359
Naughty social worker.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.962
Show me on the doll
where I should touch you.

00:29.964 --> 00:33.532
Okay, I need to keep
romantically what I do here

00:33.534 --> 00:36.802
Separate from what I do
professionally out there.

00:36.804 --> 00:37.970
Even though, in both cases,

00:37.972 --> 00:40.406
I seem to work
with the jobless and homeless.

00:40.408 --> 00:42.841
I think we have a
professional relationship.

00:42.843 --> 00:45.978
You gave us a kid,
I gave you an orgasm.

00:45.980 --> 00:49.448
Well, technically,
both of those are still pending.

00:52.752 --> 00:54.153
But I'm serious.

00:54.155 --> 00:56.655
If we're gonna do this, we have
to establish some boundaries.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.657
I mean, I'm overseeing walden's
adoption of louis.

00:58.659 --> 01:01.060
Right, right, I-I really
don't want to mess that up.

01:01.062 --> 01:04.430
It's just that I-I like
spending time with you.

01:04.432 --> 01:06.031
And I--

01:06.033 --> 01:08.033
To my surprise--

01:08.035 --> 01:10.035
Like spending time with you.

01:10.037 --> 01:12.604
I'm kind of like
poison ivy.

01:12.606 --> 01:15.974
You don't realize you've been
exposed until you get that itch.

01:18.011 --> 01:20.746
â™ª men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men â™ª

01:20.748 --> 01:23.782
â™ª ah.
â™ª men.
â™ª men.

01:27.053 --> 01:30.122
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

01:32.058 --> 01:33.292
Hey.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.294
Oh, what's that?

01:35.296 --> 01:38.197
Yes, I am wearing
the same clothes as last night.

01:39.699 --> 01:41.800
Ask not for whom
the booty calls.

01:43.069 --> 01:45.370
The booty calls for me.

01:45.372 --> 01:47.372
So I assume
you're not gonna stop

01:47.374 --> 01:48.640
Until I ask who it was.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.042
A gentleman doesn't
kiss and tell,

01:50.044 --> 01:51.443
But I'm no gentleman,

01:51.445 --> 01:53.378
And it's hard to kiss
a woman from behind.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.248
Alan, okay, who was it?

01:56.250 --> 01:58.383
(laughing):
I banged our social worker.

01:58.385 --> 01:59.985
Ms. Mcmartin?

01:59.987 --> 02:01.253
Again?

02:01.255 --> 02:02.654
What can I say?

02:02.656 --> 02:05.157
She gave my penis a good home.

02:05.159 --> 02:07.659
I thought this was gonna be
something that you did once,

02:07.661 --> 02:10.129
Like manscaping
with a straight razor.

02:11.564 --> 02:13.765
Please don't
mess this up for me.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.134
Oh, no, no, it's
a good thing.

02:15.136 --> 02:16.768
Uh, plus, we-we really
like each other,

02:16.770 --> 02:18.137
And we agreed
to respect boundaries.

02:18.139 --> 02:19.771
You know-- personal life,
professional life.

02:19.773 --> 02:21.773
Okay, and what boundaries
are you respecting

02:21.775 --> 02:23.442
When you're bragging
about having sex with her?

02:23.444 --> 02:25.811
That's just something a man
wants to share with his husband.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.446
(doorbell rings)

02:27.448 --> 02:28.747
Oh, oh, that's
ms. Mcmartin.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.149
She's here to
check up on louis.

02:30.151 --> 02:31.383
It was supposed
to be a surprise.

02:33.286 --> 02:34.419
(stammering):
Wait up, hold on...

02:34.421 --> 02:35.687
She told you this?

02:35.689 --> 02:37.923
No, she didn't tell me--
we have boundaries.

02:37.925 --> 02:41.026
I saw it on her phone when I
was going through her texts.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.931
Hello, walden.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.833
Ms. Mcmartin.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.268
Hi.

02:49.270 --> 02:51.103
What a surprise.

02:51.105 --> 02:52.504
Come on in.

02:55.642 --> 02:57.342
Hey, girl.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.346
You are social workin' it.

03:03.149 --> 03:04.550
Can I get you anything?

03:04.552 --> 03:06.552
Like a new boyfriend?

03:06.554 --> 03:09.555
Okay, so obviously
alan told you about us.

03:09.557 --> 03:10.722
Uh, yes, he has.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.224
Look, I want
you to know

03:12.226 --> 03:14.626
This will in no way affect
our professional relationship.

03:14.628 --> 03:17.362
I am here strictly as your
and louis's caseworker.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.198
And let me tell you
something right now,

03:19.200 --> 03:21.066
I want to back that case up.

03:23.736 --> 03:26.538
You know, alan, the lucky thing
is that after I smack you,

03:26.540 --> 03:29.374
There's already a social worker
here to report it to.

03:30.910 --> 03:32.578
So how is everything
going with louis?

03:32.580 --> 03:34.012
You know, it's good.

03:34.014 --> 03:36.815
Uh, but I have
a couple questions.

03:36.817 --> 03:40.219
Like... Like, okay, for example,

03:40.221 --> 03:42.187
What's the best way
to discipline him?

03:42.189 --> 03:44.623
Uh, I believe she
favors spanking.

03:50.196 --> 03:52.397
All right, what do I say

03:52.399 --> 03:55.200
When he asks
about his biological parents?

03:55.202 --> 03:59.271
And how much cheese
is too much cheese?

03:59.273 --> 04:01.173
Okay, how about we just do
one question at a time?

04:01.175 --> 04:02.374
Okay, okay.

04:02.376 --> 04:03.742
There's some cultural
things, like--

04:03.744 --> 04:06.178
Should I teach him
a cool handshake,

04:06.180 --> 04:07.746
Or does that just make me lame?

04:07.748 --> 04:09.581
Good question, bro.

04:12.352 --> 04:13.585
Blow it up.

04:14.954 --> 04:16.555
You know what might help?

04:16.557 --> 04:18.190
Talking to other foster parents.

04:18.192 --> 04:19.758
Actually,
some of my dads have started

04:19.760 --> 04:21.093
An informal support group.

04:21.095 --> 04:23.095
They kick around these kind
of questions every week.

04:23.097 --> 04:24.263
Oh, that'd be
great for you.

04:24.265 --> 04:25.697
Uh, I went to a group
for divorced dads,

04:25.699 --> 04:27.132
And it really helped.

04:27.134 --> 04:29.735
Uh, I also went to a group
for people whose moms died,

04:29.737 --> 04:31.503
But, uh, that was
just wishful thinking.

04:34.207 --> 04:35.774
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

04:35.776 --> 04:37.776
Hey, buddy.
Berta's gonna watch you

04:37.778 --> 04:39.278
When I go to
my meeting tonight, okay?

04:39.280 --> 04:40.445
Okay.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.547
We're gonna have
a lot of fun.

04:42.549 --> 04:45.651
Remember the last time when we
learned about animals and math?

04:45.653 --> 04:47.719
Yep.
Wow, what'd you learn?

04:47.721 --> 04:50.022
A trifecta is a sucker bet.

04:51.424 --> 04:52.491
And?

04:52.493 --> 04:55.360
Horses run faster when
they poop before the race.

04:56.663 --> 04:58.764
The kid's a sponge.

04:58.766 --> 05:00.232
Good morning.

05:00.234 --> 05:01.400
Speaking of sponges.

05:01.402 --> 05:02.734
Morning.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.102
Big plans
for the day?

05:04.104 --> 05:05.504
I got my first
dads group tonight.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.939
Oh.
And before that, louis and
I are gonna go to the movies.

05:07.941 --> 05:09.007
Then I'm gonna hit the gym.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.075
Oh, you know what?

05:10.077 --> 05:11.343
Why don't we go
to the gym first?

05:11.345 --> 05:12.911
That way,
we can steal some waters

05:12.913 --> 05:14.446
So we can sneak them
into the movies.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.281
You want to go?

05:16.283 --> 05:18.450
Uh, isn't today when you go
to the farmer's market

05:18.452 --> 05:20.319
And bargain for bruised peaches?

05:20.321 --> 05:21.920
I can just go
to the supermarket.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.022
They're all bruised
when you bring a sharpie.

05:24.024 --> 05:26.825
I want to spend
the day with you.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.828
Oh, great.

05:29.830 --> 05:33.432
You know, it's just that I-I was
gonna head straight from the gym

05:33.434 --> 05:35.033
To the meeting.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.368
So...

05:36.370 --> 05:38.270
If you go...

05:38.272 --> 05:39.871
Oh, oh, I get it.
Say no more.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.006
Thank you.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.341
You can just drop me off
on your way.

05:42.343 --> 05:44.876
Mmm, what do you want
for dinner?

05:44.878 --> 05:46.878
I don't know.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.280
Who thinks about dinner

05:48.282 --> 05:50.482
When you're still
swallowing your breakfast?

05:50.484 --> 05:52.451
I'll have hot dogs.

05:53.319 --> 05:55.153
Where are you going?

05:55.155 --> 05:58.790
I'm gonna do something
to help me run faster.

06:01.227 --> 06:03.228
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

06:03.230 --> 06:04.629
Hey, fellas,
the new guy's here.

06:04.631 --> 06:05.831
Hey.
Man:
Hey.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.332
Hey, you going to
spin class, sweetie?

06:07.334 --> 06:09.468
Yep. See you later.

06:09.470 --> 06:10.402
Hey, I'm rick.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.204
Hey. Walden.
Nice to meet you.

06:12.206 --> 06:13.538
Nice to meet you.
Your daughter
is very nice.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.375
Yes, she is,
but that was my wife.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.010
My daughter's 40.

06:19.012 --> 06:21.413
That's way too old for me.

06:21.415 --> 06:23.415
This is leo,
and that's jack.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.350
Hi. Hi.
Hey.
Hey, nice
to meet you.

06:25.352 --> 06:26.985
That's, uh, brian
over there.

06:26.987 --> 06:30.155
Just had newborn twins, so
he just comes here to sleep.

06:30.157 --> 06:32.591
Yeah, you could fart in his
face, he won't even wake up.

06:32.593 --> 06:33.992
Ah.

06:33.994 --> 06:34.993
Here you go.
Oh, thank you.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.495
This place is amazing.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.663
You got a bar,
and the pool table, and the tvs.

06:38.665 --> 06:41.366
You just add some hot chicks,
orange paint and an owl,

06:41.368 --> 06:43.201
And you got a hooters.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.369
(laughing)

06:44.371 --> 06:46.438
Maybe heidi can serve us beers
when she gets back.

06:46.440 --> 06:49.441
Why not? That's what she was
doing when I met her.

06:50.343 --> 06:52.277
So, uh, what's
your kid situation?

06:52.279 --> 06:53.512
Uh, I got a boy.

06:53.514 --> 06:54.446
Uh, his name's louis.

06:54.448 --> 06:55.881
He's six.

06:55.883 --> 06:59.384
Uh, he likes <i>minecraft</i> and legos
and, apparently,

06:59.386 --> 07:02.187
Twice as much cheese
as what doctors recommend.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.389
Nice. I got
three daughters.

07:04.391 --> 07:06.358
I always wanted a son,
so, uh, we adopted josh.

07:06.360 --> 07:07.893
Now I got half
a girl's volleyball team

07:07.895 --> 07:09.428
And a boy who wants
to be their cheerleader.

07:09.430 --> 07:11.596
But I love him--
no judgment.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.567
My wife and I adopted
a four-year-old girl, micah.

07:15.569 --> 07:17.736
I also do alarm systems,
in case you're in the market.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.137
Give me your contact info,

07:19.139 --> 07:21.139
I'll put you down
on my weekly e-mail blast.

07:21.141 --> 07:22.574
All the guys get it.

07:22.576 --> 07:23.475
(imitating cough):
Mark as spam.

07:23.477 --> 07:25.110
(chuckles)

07:25.112 --> 07:26.711
That is funny.

07:26.713 --> 07:29.080
Jack's alarm code is #227.

07:29.082 --> 07:32.150
I got three grown kids
from my first marriage,

07:32.152 --> 07:34.586
And heidi and I just adopted
a seven-year-old girl.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.588
Wow. You must really love kids.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.990
Kids are fine.
What I love is heidi.

07:39.659 --> 07:41.092
You saw her.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.828
When I was in college,

07:42.830 --> 07:45.530
Her mother was in sixth grade.

07:46.499 --> 07:47.833
And if you think about it,

07:47.835 --> 07:50.168
My next wife
isn't even born yet.

07:52.805 --> 07:55.407
So, uh, why did you and
your wife choose to adopt?

07:55.409 --> 07:58.176
My wife is incapable
of having children.

07:58.178 --> 07:59.444
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.

07:59.446 --> 08:00.412
Yeah, his name is alan.

08:00.414 --> 08:02.013
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.448
A-although, uh,

08:03.450 --> 08:05.450
He did order boner pills
from china once

08:05.452 --> 08:07.118
That made him lactate.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.587
(chuckles)

08:08.589 --> 08:09.855
(chuckles)
uh,

08:09.857 --> 08:11.790
So, anything going on
with louis?

08:11.792 --> 08:13.625
Yeah, you know,
I have a couple questions

08:13.627 --> 08:15.494
That-that you're
the perfect person to answer.

08:15.496 --> 08:17.095
Why is that?

08:18.331 --> 08:20.332
'cause I'm handsome? Charming?

08:20.334 --> 08:22.701
College graduate?
Top home security specialist

08:22.703 --> 08:24.803
In the south bay
three years running?

08:24.805 --> 08:28.006
Yes, that...

08:28.008 --> 08:31.009
Louis is also all those things.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.944
I'm just messing with you!

08:32.946 --> 08:34.479
(chuckles)
yeah.

08:34.481 --> 08:37.482
Ms. Mcmartin told us
your kid was mixed-race.

08:37.484 --> 08:38.717
So what do you want to know?

08:38.719 --> 08:40.952
Uh, do you want to know
how to comb his hair?

08:40.954 --> 08:42.821
Uh, what type of music
to expose him to?

08:42.823 --> 08:44.656
Do I need to teach
him a cool handshake?

08:44.658 --> 08:46.658
So that's-that's actually
a thing?

08:46.660 --> 08:49.895
Yeah, yeah. Here, let me
show you, let me show you.
Oh.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.897
Huh? Huh?
Ooh.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.164
That is cool.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.666
And you just did it

08:54.668 --> 08:56.535
To hand me your business card.

08:56.537 --> 08:58.570
Yeah. If you tell me
that I sent you,

08:58.572 --> 09:00.639
Then you get 20% off.

09:02.141 --> 09:04.543
By the way,
have you seen my wife?

09:04.545 --> 09:06.511
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

09:06.513 --> 09:08.346
Hey, uh, thanks
for having me.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.682
You know, this is great.
I-I don't think I knew it,

09:10.684 --> 09:12.017
But I needed a place like this.

09:12.019 --> 09:13.852
You mean a place
to get away from our wives?

09:13.854 --> 09:15.353
Preach!

09:15.355 --> 09:17.756
Wait, why do you need a place?
You're married to a guy.

09:17.758 --> 09:20.559
Your only problem is, do I
watch <i>sportscenter</i> before,

09:20.561 --> 09:22.561
During or after sex?

09:22.563 --> 09:25.730
Uh, actually, it's-it's a little
more complicated than that.

09:25.732 --> 09:26.731
What do you mean?

09:26.733 --> 09:28.066
I mean, well, imagine...

09:28.068 --> 09:30.769
All of the wife
and none of the sex.

09:30.771 --> 09:33.505
Yeah, we don't need to imagine.
We're married, too.

09:33.507 --> 09:35.707
I don't know what you guys
are talking about.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.609
I get all the sex
I can handle.

09:37.611 --> 09:40.879
Which, at my age,
is about once a month.

09:40.881 --> 09:44.683
Can-can I share something
that doesn't leave this room?

09:44.685 --> 09:47.686
Yeah, sure. Oh, these guys know
that back when I was single...

09:47.688 --> 09:49.421
(whispers):
I used to bang his sister.

09:51.757 --> 09:54.392
Okay, here's the thing.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.027
I'm not gay.

09:57.196 --> 09:58.597
I-I married my best friend

09:58.599 --> 10:00.065
So I could adopt louis.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.533
Really?

10:01.535 --> 10:04.102
Then you shouldn't have any
of these problems.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.371
And yet I have all
of these problems.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.440
I mean, that's why
it's so great coming here.

10:08.442 --> 10:09.941
I get to get away from alan.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.644
I mean, he wants
to do everything with me.

10:12.646 --> 10:15.847
He ordered a groupon
for two-for-one prostate exams.

10:17.583 --> 10:19.417
Are your wives that clingy?

10:19.419 --> 10:21.586
Oh, yeah.
My wife just bought golf clubs

10:21.588 --> 10:24.055
So she could ruin golf for me.

10:24.057 --> 10:27.826
My wife's outside waiting
in the minivan.

10:27.828 --> 10:30.595
Yeah, even I have to get away
from heidi every now and then.

10:30.597 --> 10:33.665
Do you know what
the worst "wife" thing is?

10:33.667 --> 10:36.901
When you forget to ask them,
"how was your day?"

10:36.903 --> 10:38.236
Oh.
No, no,

10:38.238 --> 10:40.138
The worst thing
is when you ask alan,

10:40.140 --> 10:42.674
"how was your day?"
and he answers.

10:44.110 --> 10:45.744
You know, it's funny--
I-I always thought

10:45.746 --> 10:47.579
Being married to a guy
would be different.

10:47.581 --> 10:49.614
In some ways, it is.
I mean, uh... For example,

10:49.616 --> 10:51.683
I imagine that you guys enjoy it

10:51.685 --> 10:53.618
When you walk in
on your wives masturbating.

10:53.620 --> 10:55.186
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah...

10:55.188 --> 10:57.255
Oh, no!

10:58.591 --> 11:00.925
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

11:00.927 --> 11:03.595
Hey, there you are.
We didn't get to talk yesterday.

11:03.597 --> 11:05.630
How was your day?

11:05.632 --> 11:07.632
Great. How was your...

11:07.634 --> 11:09.467
Day?

11:09.469 --> 11:11.469
Oh, oh, it was the worst.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.638
Fade in: Supermarket.
There were only two lanes open,

11:13.640 --> 11:15.206
But there must have been
30 of us.

11:15.208 --> 11:18.176
30? Wow, that's
an amazing end to that story.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.378
I wish. You know they don't
give you bags anymore?

11:20.380 --> 11:22.380
If you want a bag,
that's ten cents.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.382
Ten cents.
That's outrageous.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.884
That's six bruised peaches.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.820
Uh, anyway, so I-I
went out to the parking lot

11:28.822 --> 11:29.821
And there was a...
Alan, can...

11:29.823 --> 11:31.790
Can we just jump to the end?

11:31.792 --> 11:34.292
She agreed not to press charges.

11:34.294 --> 11:38.663
Okay, that is the end to, like,
way too many of your stories.

11:38.665 --> 11:40.799
So, uh, how did your
foster dads group go?

11:40.801 --> 11:42.667
I-I texted you,
but you never answered.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.636
Really?

11:44.638 --> 11:47.238
I... That's...
I must not have gotten it.

11:47.240 --> 11:50.542
Are you sure? Uh, it says
it was read at 7:47.

11:51.877 --> 11:54.746
I guess it was ignored at 7:48.

11:54.748 --> 11:57.649
Dads group was really fun.

11:57.651 --> 11:59.517
Yeah, I think it's gonna be
really gonna helpful for louis.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.486
Oh, great, great. Uh, when
are you gonna do it again?

12:01.488 --> 12:03.321
Uh... Well, you know,
I was gonna actually

12:03.323 --> 12:04.689
Have the guys over tonight.

12:04.691 --> 12:07.425
Tonight? The place is a mess.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.661
And    <i>the good wi</i>is on.

12:09.663 --> 12:10.929
Mmm.

12:10.931 --> 12:13.498
Well, I do want to meet
the guys, though.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.701
Oh. Well, you know, it's a...
It's actually, it's a pretty

12:16.703 --> 12:18.403
Tight-knit group, so...

12:18.405 --> 12:20.572
I don't think people
will be able to open up

12:20.574 --> 12:22.006
If there's a stranger around.
Besides, don't...

12:22.008 --> 12:23.942
Don't you and ms. Mcmartin
have a thing tonight?

12:23.944 --> 12:26.511
Nope. Uh-uh.
Free as a boner in sweat pants.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.379
No. Come on.

12:28.381 --> 12:31.182
You deserve a thing, so...

12:31.184 --> 12:32.751
Here.

12:32.753 --> 12:34.953
Well, I-I do deserve a thing.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.254
Hey, hey--
you only give me money

12:36.256 --> 12:37.589
When you're trying
to get rid of me.

12:37.591 --> 12:40.592
No, I don't.
Here, take more money.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.762
Wait, hold on.
Do you...

12:43.764 --> 12:45.230
Do you not want me
around tonight?

12:45.232 --> 12:47.732
No, it's just... It's just...

12:47.734 --> 12:49.701
I had fun last night,

12:49.703 --> 12:51.970
And I want to have fun
again tonight.

12:51.972 --> 12:55.373
I see. And webster's
defines fun as having

12:55.375 --> 12:58.576
Or pertaining to
the absence of alan.

12:58.578 --> 13:01.412
From the latin:
Hurticus feelingsmus.

13:01.414 --> 13:03.915
Okay, are you really asking
why I don't want you around

13:03.917 --> 13:05.750
While you're talking like that?

13:05.752 --> 13:06.985
Oh, so you really
don't want me around?

13:06.987 --> 13:10.455
Yes, or as defined
in webster's, affirmative.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.123
Don't take my dictionary thing.
Well,

13:12.125 --> 13:13.958
At least you have a thing.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.660
I don't have anything
for myself.

13:15.662 --> 13:18.129
I mean, every time
I turn around, there you are.

13:18.131 --> 13:21.800
Oh, what? Let's just do it.
Look, oh, there you are.

13:21.802 --> 13:24.235
Well, I'm sorry
if my presence offends you.

13:24.237 --> 13:25.637
If bags weren't
ten cents apiece,

13:25.639 --> 13:26.805
I'd put one over my head.

13:26.807 --> 13:29.841
Listen, I just want
one thing for myself.

13:29.843 --> 13:32.577
One thing where
you're not around.

13:32.579 --> 13:33.945
Is that too much to ask?

13:33.947 --> 13:36.581
Fine. If that's
how you feel, you know,

13:36.583 --> 13:40.418
Have your stupid little group
all to yourself in our house.

13:40.420 --> 13:43.988
But don't expect me to wait
to watch <i>the good wife.</i>

13:44.790 --> 13:47.492
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

13:50.863 --> 13:52.997
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

13:52.999 --> 13:56.000
And here's a picture of heidi
on a nude beach in cancÃºn.

13:56.002 --> 13:59.470
Whoa. I can
see her can.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.906
And her <i>cÃºn.</i>

14:06.679 --> 14:08.046
Alan?

14:08.814 --> 14:10.548
I thought you had a thing.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.851
Well, if you saw my feet
after the paraffin dip,

14:12.853 --> 14:15.019
You'd know I already
had my thing.

14:16.789 --> 14:19.357
Don't worry, I won't spoil
your little party.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.860
You must be the dads
who are part of the group.

14:23.028 --> 14:25.463
I'm the dad who's
not part of the group.

14:25.465 --> 14:28.199
And here we go.

14:30.035 --> 14:32.370
Hey, hey, why don't...
Why don't you have a beer?

14:32.372 --> 14:35.006
Oh, no, I'll be in my room.
I can amuse myself.

14:35.008 --> 14:37.308
I have a half bag
of cheetos and a radio.

14:43.816 --> 14:46.651
Oh, hey, hey, come on, man.

14:46.653 --> 14:50.521
No. Please stay.

14:50.523 --> 14:53.992
Well, when the boss says jump,
I say how... Hi. I'm alan.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.894
Wow, what a fun way
to meet someone.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.695
Here you go.
There you go.

14:57.697 --> 14:59.831
Oh. Thank you, thank you.
So, uh, so what's going on?

14:59.833 --> 15:02.600
Or-or should I say whassup?!

15:02.602 --> 15:04.335
You remember
that?

15:04.337 --> 15:06.037
You guys... You guys
remember that? Remember?

15:06.039 --> 15:08.573
Whassup?!

15:08.575 --> 15:12.911
That is the whitest guy
I have ever seen.

15:12.913 --> 15:14.746
Wait, wait, is that
all you're serving?

15:14.748 --> 15:17.048
Chips? Not even
in a bowl?

15:17.050 --> 15:18.116
You should be embarrassed.

15:18.118 --> 15:20.785
Oh, trust me, I'm embarrassed.

15:21.854 --> 15:23.621
Look, nobody cares.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.423
Alan seems to care,
and you care

15:25.425 --> 15:26.925
About alan's feelings,
don't you?

15:26.927 --> 15:29.661
Ooh, I like him.
Two points for the silver fox.

15:31.096 --> 15:32.931
Maybe I'll just, uh,
throw together some nachos.

15:32.933 --> 15:35.366
We're fine. The...
Hey, I don't want you

15:35.368 --> 15:37.902
To go to all the trouble.
See? I'm thinking about you.

15:37.904 --> 15:40.038
It's no trouble.
It's just, uh, chips, uh...

15:40.040 --> 15:43.141
(with accent): Guacamole, uh,
jalapeÃ±os and, uh, <i>queso fresco.</i>

15:44.743 --> 15:46.044
My wife's idea
of nachos

15:46.046 --> 15:48.579
Is just dumping
some salsa on chips.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.915
Well, I'm nacho
average wife.

15:50.917 --> 15:53.451
(laughing)

15:54.420 --> 15:56.087
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

15:56.089 --> 15:58.222
So this guy--
I bail him out completely,

15:58.224 --> 15:59.657
Agree to marry him,

15:59.659 --> 16:01.492
And guess what we do
on our wedding night.

16:01.494 --> 16:04.329
I-I don't need to hear that.
No judgment.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.764
Nothing.
We came straight home.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.299
Same place we went
on our honeymoon.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.803
The guy has a jet.
How hard is it to go to aruba?

16:11.805 --> 16:12.804
Jamaica.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.572
â™ª ooh, I wanna take you

16:14.574 --> 16:15.773
â™ª to bermuda

16:15.775 --> 16:18.843
â™ª bahama, come on,
pretty mama â™ª

16:18.845 --> 16:20.845
â™ª key largo, montego

16:20.847 --> 16:24.949
â™ª baby, why don't we go
â™ª ooh, I want to take you
down to kokomo â™ª

16:24.951 --> 16:26.584
â™ª we'll get there fast

16:26.586 --> 16:28.653
â™ª and then we'll take it slow

16:28.655 --> 16:32.490
â™ª that's where we want to go

16:32.492 --> 16:34.792
â™ª way down in kokomo

16:34.794 --> 16:35.960
â™ª martinique

16:35.962 --> 16:37.862
â™ª that monserrat mystique.

16:37.864 --> 16:40.231
(all whooping, laughing)

16:41.367 --> 16:42.867
That is my jam,

16:42.869 --> 16:44.869
And y'all are my bitches.

16:44.871 --> 16:46.938
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

16:51.777 --> 16:53.044
What the hell are you doing?

16:53.046 --> 16:56.180
I'm just being a fun guy.
What are <i>you</i> doing?

16:56.182 --> 16:59.884
You're about as much fun
as the polyp in rick's colon.

16:59.886 --> 17:01.519
You're doing exactly what
I thought you would.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.021
You're taking
my friends.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.655
Just like you
take everything.

17:04.657 --> 17:06.391
You took my house,
you took my money,

17:06.393 --> 17:09.027
You even took my old jeans
and turned 'em into cutoffs.

17:09.029 --> 17:11.829
They're called jorts,
and they look great on me.
Okay,

17:11.831 --> 17:13.498
You knew I didn't
want you here

17:13.500 --> 17:15.500
And you said you
weren't gonna be here,

17:15.502 --> 17:16.901
Yet here you are

17:16.903 --> 17:18.236
With your...
(with accent): Guacamole

17:18.238 --> 17:20.872
And your <i>fresco queso.</i>

17:20.874 --> 17:24.242
It's <i>queso fresco.</i>
<i>You do not correct me</i>
<i>when I'm mocking you.</i>

17:24.244 --> 17:25.710
You know what? You know what?
I think...

17:25.712 --> 17:27.812
I think that the reason
that you didn't want me here

17:27.814 --> 17:29.013
Is because you were afraid

17:29.015 --> 17:30.681
That they were gonna
like me better than you.

17:30.683 --> 17:33.084
Okay, I can honestly
say that I have never

17:33.086 --> 17:35.520
Had that thought
in my life.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.255
Everything
okay in here?

17:39.992 --> 17:41.826
Well, am I allowed

17:41.828 --> 17:44.195
To answer your
friends, walden?

17:44.197 --> 17:46.097
I'm sorry you guys
had to see this.

17:46.099 --> 17:48.166
Oh, come on,
we've all been there.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.535
I mean, just a while back,
jack's wife chased him

17:50.537 --> 17:52.737
Around his house
with a steak knife.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.505
Trust me, I was
in no danger.

17:54.507 --> 17:57.842
She couldn't use a kitchen
utensil to save her life.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.844
We can help you
work though this.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.212
That's what
the group is for.

18:01.214 --> 18:02.680
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah,

18:02.682 --> 18:05.216
Hey, why don't we
do some role playing?

18:05.218 --> 18:07.085
Okay, you're...
You're, uh, alan,

18:07.087 --> 18:09.787
And you just
found out that walden

18:09.789 --> 18:12.023
Doesn't want you
around his friends.

18:12.025 --> 18:14.225
Fine. Thank
you, walden,

18:14.227 --> 18:16.694
For letting me live
here rent-free.

18:16.696 --> 18:19.564
Despite not contributing
anything to this household,

18:19.566 --> 18:22.033
I ignore even your
most basic requests.

18:22.035 --> 18:23.801
Um...
You're not really
supposed to use this

18:23.803 --> 18:25.069
To attack.
Wait,

18:25.071 --> 18:26.637
Hold on. Hold on,
hold on, hold on.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.206
I'm walden, and I get off

18:28.208 --> 18:30.041
On making alan
feel bad about himself.

18:30.043 --> 18:33.744
Well, I'm alan, and I
get off on everything.

18:33.746 --> 18:35.113
Including the
stock photos

18:35.115 --> 18:37.615
That come from the picture
frames from target.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.418
That was one time.
The internet was down,

18:40.420 --> 18:42.987
And-and she reminded me
of a girl I knew in high school.

18:42.989 --> 18:46.157
Yeah, we've all been there.
Sears catalog.

18:46.159 --> 18:47.291
Neiman marcus.

18:47.293 --> 18:50.161
The indian girl
from the land o'lakes box.

18:51.730 --> 18:54.499
Okay, you know what, I'm sick
of having the same fight

18:54.501 --> 18:55.833
Over and over again.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.069
You know, why do we
keep doing this?

18:58.071 --> 19:00.338
'cause you love him
and he loves you.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.740
Also, where am I?

19:02.742 --> 19:05.510
Oh, hey, brian, I know you've
been asleep for a few meetings,

19:05.512 --> 19:08.012
But walden told us
they're not actually gay.

19:08.014 --> 19:10.248
I know they're not gay.
I said they love each other.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.916
It's the only thing
that can explain

19:11.918 --> 19:13.584
Why they make
each other so crazy.

19:15.120 --> 19:18.122
You chose to adopt this kid
together for a reason.

19:18.124 --> 19:19.757
Why don't you talk about that?

19:19.759 --> 19:21.159
(cell phone beeps)

19:21.161 --> 19:23.694
Oh, god, my wife
said the twins are sick.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.129
I got to go.

19:25.131 --> 19:27.665
Back to sleep.

19:27.667 --> 19:31.035
By the way,
not cool about my sister.

19:31.037 --> 19:33.004
No judgment?

19:34.540 --> 19:37.808
I'm alan.

19:37.810 --> 19:40.878
And I'm always there for walden
whenever he needs me the most.

19:42.314 --> 19:44.215
And I do look good in jorts.

19:45.384 --> 19:48.886
And my nachos
are restaurant quality.

19:50.289 --> 19:53.191
Well, I'm walden, and, uh,

19:53.193 --> 19:56.460
I've been the best friend
that alan's ever had.

19:56.462 --> 19:58.362
(short chuckle)
and also,

19:58.364 --> 20:00.031
I'm not angry about the 20s

20:00.033 --> 20:02.333
He occasionally steals
from my wallet.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.635
I'm sorry I said
I didn't want you around.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.571
I'm sorry I was smothering you.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.206
Oh... Bring it in.
I'm s...

20:08.208 --> 20:09.807
Come on.

20:12.177 --> 20:13.211
Hey, hey...

20:13.213 --> 20:14.645
You know where we should go?

20:15.847 --> 20:18.216
â™ª bermuda, bahama

20:18.218 --> 20:21.018
â™ª come on, pretty mama

20:21.020 --> 20:23.354
â™ª to key largo, montego,
baby why don't we go? â™ª

20:23.356 --> 20:26.057
Wait, are you really
taking me to...
No.

20:26.059 --> 20:29.160
â™ª the florida keys,
there's a place called koko... â™ª

20:29.162 --> 20:30.995
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

20:34.233 --> 20:36.334
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª
I just want to tell you guys,

20:36.336 --> 20:38.202
I love being
a part of this group.

20:38.204 --> 20:39.737
And we love
having you, alan.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.539
Oh, well, thank you.
So, as I was saying,

20:41.541 --> 20:43.374
Why is it that
I'm willing to take

20:43.376 --> 20:44.909
Three hours to make him dinner

20:44.911 --> 20:47.778
And he won't take three seconds
to tell me what he wants?

20:47.780 --> 20:50.248
Speaking of three seconds,
can we talk about the sex?

20:50.250 --> 20:53.317
(scoffs) at least you're
having sex, sister.
