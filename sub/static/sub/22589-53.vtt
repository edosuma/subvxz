00:09.177 --> 00:12.722
<i>NARRATOR". The start of a new semester
at ivy covered Yale University...</i>

00:12.931 --> 00:16.768
<i>...and the portly professor of Egyptology
outlines his plans.</i>

00:17.644 --> 00:19.896
And then, of course,
there'll be the field trip...

00:20.104 --> 00:21.898
...to the Gotham City Park.

00:22.106 --> 00:26.778
Oh, it bodes to be a truly exciting class,
young gentlemen.

00:26.986 --> 00:30.740
That is, if you're really interested
in Egyptology...

00:30.949 --> 00:36.162
...and not just two football players hoping
this will be a snap course.

00:36.371 --> 00:39.332
Oh, we're real dedicated students,
professor.

00:39.541 --> 00:40.833
Uh, sure.

00:41.042 --> 00:42.669
- How about you, professor?
- Hmm?

00:42.877 --> 00:44.546
We heard you flipped a while back...

00:44.754 --> 00:47.507
...and assumed the identity of King Tut.
Is that right?

00:47.715 --> 00:50.385
Oh, that campus newspaper.

00:50.593 --> 00:51.761
Yes, it's true.

00:51.970 --> 00:54.222
I suffer from a unique combination...

00:54.430 --> 00:58.268
...of amnesia and identity transference.

00:58.476 --> 01:01.938
It only happens when I suffer
cranial concussion, however.

01:02.146 --> 01:03.773
Thus, as you can see...

01:03.982 --> 01:08.361
...I have protected myself with this hard hat.

01:16.661 --> 01:20.373
Hail almighty Tut, prince of darkness.

01:20.582 --> 01:23.459
Hail sovereign of all that's mean and evil.

01:23.668 --> 01:25.837
- Hail.
- Hail.

01:29.173 --> 01:31.009
The gang's all here.

01:34.554 --> 01:39.726
<i>NARRATOR". And late that night at
the Gotham City Museum Egyptology section...</i>

01:42.020 --> 01:43.521
What are you doing here?

01:43.730 --> 01:45.273
What are you doing here?

01:45.481 --> 01:46.733
I asked you first.

01:46.941 --> 01:49.736
So you did, so you did.

01:49.944 --> 01:52.572
I am here to lay rightful claim...

01:52.780 --> 01:55.033
...to yon sarcophagus.

01:55.241 --> 01:58.244
- You're a thief?
-You're right.

02:02.123 --> 02:04.417
And how is the guard's condition,
Chief O'Hara?

02:04.626 --> 02:06.169
Still unconscious.

02:06.377 --> 02:10.006
In times like these, there's only one man
who can help us solve the problem:

02:10.214 --> 02:11.507
Bruce Wayne.

02:11.716 --> 02:14.052
Bruce Wayne? Not Batman?

02:14.260 --> 02:17.347
There's an Egyptian costume ball
at the Gotham City Hotel tonight.

02:17.555 --> 02:19.932
Bruce Wayne is chairman.

02:21.059 --> 02:24.145
Perhaps he knows something we don't.

02:24.687 --> 02:27.690
You're going to look
very handsome tonight, Bruce.

02:27.899 --> 02:30.526
A magnificent Caesar.

02:30.735 --> 02:32.570
I'm glad we had this little dress rehearsal.

02:32.779 --> 02:35.907
Ha, ha. I can't wait to see Lisa dressed
as Cleopatra.

02:37.909 --> 02:39.535
Phone for you, sir. In the study.

02:39.744 --> 02:40.953
It's Commissioner Gordon.

02:41.162 --> 02:42.622
Commissioner Gordon?

02:42.830 --> 02:45.416
What would he want with you, Bruce?

02:45.625 --> 02:47.418
We'll soon find out, Aunt Harriet.

02:47.627 --> 02:49.253
Excuse me.

02:50.380 --> 02:52.840
I can't imagine Alfred
making an error like that.

02:53.049 --> 02:54.759
What did you say, Dick?

02:54.967 --> 02:57.261
Uh, nothing, Aunt Harriet.

02:58.930 --> 03:00.973
Alfred, I'm shocked
at your breach of secrecy.

03:01.182 --> 03:04.727
No need to be, sir. The commissioner's call
was for Bruce Wayne, not Batman.

03:04.936 --> 03:09.107
But a feeling inside me suggested
that you should take it in here.

03:10.066 --> 03:13.069
- Hello, commissioner.
-As chairman of tonight's Egyptian ball...

03:13.277 --> 03:16.406
...can you tell me what significance
the robbery of a sarcophagus...

03:16.614 --> 03:18.991
...circa 1300 B.C. might have?

03:19.200 --> 03:21.828
<i>Its principal value would be that
of an antique.</i>

03:22.036 --> 03:23.287
Wait a moment, commissioner.

03:23.496 --> 03:27.583
1300 B.C. was the era
in which King Tut trod the land.

03:27.792 --> 03:29.836
That's what I was afraid of.

03:30.044 --> 03:32.714
I'd hoped it was some sort
of a publicity stunt.

03:32.922 --> 03:35.550
My committee would never engage
in such a stunt.

03:35.758 --> 03:40.388
Then it appears our old nemesis King Tut
may have returned to haunt us.

03:41.389 --> 03:44.016
My suggestion would be
to call Batman immediately.

03:44.225 --> 03:46.728
Sound thinking, Bruce.

03:47.562 --> 03:49.355
Bruce Wayne advised me to call Batman.

03:49.564 --> 03:54.026
Heh. Well, I guess millionaires
aren't so dumb after all.

03:54.235 --> 03:56.446
Otherwise they never would
have become millionaires.

03:56.654 --> 03:57.739
<i>Hmm.</i>

04:01.492 --> 04:02.702
Yes, commissioner.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.246
<i>The worst has come to pass, Batman.</i>

04:05.455 --> 04:07.999
I know. King Tut is back in Gotham City.
We'll be right there.

04:09.459 --> 04:12.170
Absolutely incredible.

04:13.379 --> 04:15.965
You'd think the man could read my mind.

04:16.173 --> 04:18.341
To the Batpoles.

04:20.000 --> 04:26.074

05:48.558 --> 05:50.226
Why doesn't he stay where he belongs?

05:50.434 --> 05:52.895
Up at Yale, where he's a nice,
mild-mannered professor?

05:53.104 --> 05:56.065
Don't forget, Robin,
when the professor metamorphosizes--

05:56.274 --> 05:59.235
Changes into King Tut...

05:59.443 --> 06:00.903
...he forgets his true identity.

06:01.112 --> 06:03.531
- No clues?
-Nary a one.

06:03.739 --> 06:07.159
Tut once tried to claim Gotham City
as his kingdom.

06:07.368 --> 06:09.412
You don't suppose he'd try it again?

06:09.620 --> 06:12.039
I doubt it. He was thwarted in that gambit.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.627
Hello?

06:17.753 --> 06:19.380
No.

06:19.589 --> 06:22.383
Oh. How brutal.

06:22.592 --> 06:25.052
Well, we'll get on it right away.

06:25.261 --> 06:28.973
In the meantime,
leave everything exactly as you found it.

06:31.893 --> 06:35.062
Fouad Sphinx, the talented
Middle Eastern pantomimist...

06:35.271 --> 06:38.816
...has just been found
in his swank suite at the Oasis Hotel.

06:39.025 --> 06:40.526
- Alive?
- Barely, Batman.

06:40.735 --> 06:42.987
He's been pummeled
about the head and shoulders...

06:43.195 --> 06:45.281
...by someone answering
the description of Tut.

06:45.489 --> 06:48.284
Furthermore, he was tied up
in the classic tradition.

06:48.492 --> 06:53.289
Oh. Sphinx, Oasis, Middle Eastern.
You think it could mean something?

06:53.497 --> 06:55.416
Chances are it could be a clue. Let's go.

06:58.961 --> 07:02.048
<i>NARRATOR". Meanwhile,
in Tut's hideout at the Pyramid Club...</i>

07:02.256 --> 07:05.468
<i>...a shattered roadhouse
in an underdeveloped suburb...</i>

07:14.143 --> 07:16.312
Hi, Tut baby. What's shaking?

07:16.520 --> 07:20.232
Batman's head, unless I miss my guess.
Heh, heh.

07:20.441 --> 07:22.652
- Can we get up now?
- My back hurts.

07:22.860 --> 07:25.154
You may rise.

07:25.363 --> 07:30.242
- Oh! Be it ever so humble.
-What's with him?

07:30.451 --> 07:33.162
Please, Neila,
you may be goddess of the Nile...

07:33.371 --> 07:35.831
...but I am your king.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.917
And soon...

07:38.125 --> 07:41.462
...I will claim my queen.

07:42.380 --> 07:45.675
Mm. The lovely Lisa Carson...

07:45.883 --> 07:49.136
...daughter of wealthy socialite
John E. Carson...

07:49.345 --> 07:52.348
...will appear at the Egyptian Ball tonight
as Cleopatra.

07:52.556 --> 07:56.769
Her escort will be millionaire Bruce Wayne
as Julius Caesar.

07:56.978 --> 07:58.396
Come, observe.

08:00.564 --> 08:03.609
Heh. Millionaire Bruce Wayne.

08:03.818 --> 08:05.194
Blech!

08:05.403 --> 08:08.447
Tonight he'll lose his queen to me...

08:08.656 --> 08:10.366
...the king!

08:10.574 --> 08:14.161
Oh, pulchritudinous!

08:14.370 --> 08:18.207
Just as I have envisioned her
down through the centuries.

08:18.416 --> 08:19.834
And tonight...

08:20.042 --> 08:22.586
...she will be mine alone.

08:23.462 --> 08:24.797
And where does that leave me?

08:26.215 --> 08:28.759
You could always be a lady in waiting.

08:28.968 --> 08:31.804
- But I thought she was--
-Silence, Tutlings!

08:32.013 --> 08:35.182
I have been reincarnated,
as the whole world knows...

08:35.390 --> 08:39.061
...and now so has the lovely Cleopatra.

08:41.272 --> 08:44.900
Meanwhile, the Caped Crusaders
Bat-climb their way...

08:45.109 --> 08:48.863
<i>...to Fouad Sphinx's hotel suite.</i>

08:50.281 --> 08:53.075
Suzy Knickerbocker,
what are you doing in Gotham City?

08:53.284 --> 08:55.578
I go where the action is, Batman.

08:55.786 --> 08:58.914
The Caribbean, the Riviera,
the Greek Islands.

08:59.123 --> 09:01.333
Wherever there's glamor, that's where I am.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.836
I'm afraid you'll find it pretty quiet here, then.

09:04.045 --> 09:05.588
Oh, I don't know, Boy Wonder.

09:05.796 --> 09:09.383
I hear millionaire Bruce Wayne
is really one of the hippies.

09:09.592 --> 09:14.138
All that marvelous money
and fantastic Wayne Manor.

09:14.346 --> 09:15.598
Stately Wayne Manor.

09:15.806 --> 09:18.225
Mr. Wayne is basically
a very serious young man.

09:18.434 --> 09:21.062
Sometimes those serious ones fool you.

09:21.270 --> 09:24.940
Batman, I think that's a darling
little costume you're wearing.

09:25.149 --> 09:27.777
Where did you get it, in London or Rome?

09:27.985 --> 09:30.863
No, I believe in patronizing local craftsmen.

09:31.072 --> 09:33.908
There's a guy who makes great capes
and cowls right here in Gotham City.

09:34.116 --> 09:37.244
Ha, ha. I think you two belong in my column.

09:37.453 --> 09:41.540
I'll slip you in somewhere
between Acapulco and Princess Grace.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.459
Holy jet set!

09:43.667 --> 09:46.337
Imagine us in Suzy Knickerbocker's
column, Batman.

09:46.545 --> 09:50.591
An unlikely spot
for two mundane crime fighters.

09:50.800 --> 09:54.970
- And speaking of crime fighting...
-I adored seeing both of you.

10:00.643 --> 10:04.271
I wonder who they really are.

10:04.480 --> 10:07.441
Probably a couple of international playboys.

10:07.650 --> 10:11.362
I mean, who else would climb walls?

10:18.953 --> 10:20.412
Ah, the Caped Crusaders.

10:20.621 --> 10:24.208
We left everything just as we found it
per Commissioner Gordon's instruction.

10:24.416 --> 10:29.213
Good work, officer. Ah, that must be
the talented pantomimist in question.

10:30.005 --> 10:31.715
How do you feel, Mr. Sphinx?

10:31.924 --> 10:33.467
How do I look, Batman?

10:33.676 --> 10:35.845
King Tut is a very muscular fellow.

10:36.053 --> 10:38.013
What did King Tut say?

10:38.222 --> 10:40.015
He said, "You got my message?"

10:40.224 --> 10:41.684
Was there anything else?

10:41.892 --> 10:43.853
Yes. He left you a note.

10:44.061 --> 10:46.856
It's in my pocket here.

10:56.699 --> 10:59.243
It's written in an ancient tongue, Robin...

10:59.451 --> 11:02.163
...circa 1300 B.C.

11:02.371 --> 11:04.915
- King Tut's era.
-Yes, this will require further study.

11:05.416 --> 11:06.667
- To the Batcave.
-Batman.

11:06.876 --> 11:07.960
Yes, Mr. Sphinx?

11:08.169 --> 11:10.504
Think it would be all right
if someone untied me?

11:10.713 --> 11:12.923
I'm getting a little cramped.

11:13.757 --> 11:18.179
Of course. Officer, untie this poor fellow.

11:29.481 --> 11:31.942
"L, the great King Tut
have returned to Gotham City...

11:32.151 --> 11:35.070
...to wreak revenge on Batman
and his accursed companion."

11:35.279 --> 11:36.488
Hey, that's me.

11:36.697 --> 11:39.700
"And next in importance,
to claim my own."

11:39.909 --> 11:41.160
His own what?

11:41.368 --> 11:43.746
That is the question.

11:48.292 --> 11:50.419
Commissioner,
we've just deciphered the scroll.

11:52.338 --> 11:54.965
Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Uh-huh.

11:55.174 --> 11:58.928
I knew that he'd be after you and Robin,
but to claim his own...

11:59.136 --> 12:01.639
- What does it mean?
-Whatever his plan, commissioner...

12:01.847 --> 12:04.099
...with the Ancient Egyptian Ball
being tonight...

12:04.308 --> 12:07.603
...I have a feeling our evil friend
may put in an appearance there.

12:07.811 --> 12:09.855
I'll have a cordon of police in attendance...

12:10.064 --> 12:13.359
...and to keep them from being noticed,
they'll be attired as Egyptians.

12:14.151 --> 12:18.072
I want seven of your best men
at the ball tonight in Egyptian raiment.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.740
Gotham City's finest...

12:19.949 --> 12:21.742
...dressed up like a bunch of heathens?

12:21.951 --> 12:24.703
May the saints preserve us.

12:31.502 --> 12:33.462
Don't you ninnies understand...

12:33.671 --> 12:36.966
...that I want Batman and Robin
to show up at the ball tonight?

12:37.174 --> 12:39.134
What happens when you show up
at the ball?

12:39.343 --> 12:43.013
You underestimate
your sovereign's think tank.

12:43.222 --> 12:46.976
I have this day delivered
to a certain address in Gotham City...

12:47.184 --> 12:51.981
...a replica of the royal robes and mask
of the great King Tut.

12:52.189 --> 12:56.610
Mayor Linseed is away on one
of his frequent visits to the Asian front...

12:56.819 --> 13:01.365
...but Deputy Mayor Zorty
is acting in his stead.

13:01.573 --> 13:06.370
Tonight he will be I! Heh.

13:29.601 --> 13:32.396
What are you doing?
Get your hands off me. This is an outrage.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.106
Tell that to the commissioner.

13:34.315 --> 13:36.734
What in the world
do you think you're doing?

13:50.539 --> 13:52.041
For you, my queen.

14:14.730 --> 14:16.607
Good work, men. You got him.

14:16.815 --> 14:18.567
The city's no longer in peril.

14:18.776 --> 14:21.070
The city may not be in peril, O'Hara...

14:21.278 --> 14:23.530
...but you and your clumsy clods are.

14:23.739 --> 14:24.990
Uh-oh.

14:25.199 --> 14:27.242
If it's who I think it is, and I think it is...

14:27.451 --> 14:30.788
...I'll be back pounding the beat,
and so will you, commissioner.

14:30.996 --> 14:32.289
Unhand him, gentlemen.

14:35.959 --> 14:37.169
It's himself.

14:37.378 --> 14:39.421
Deputy Mayor Zorty-

14:39.630 --> 14:41.090
We all owe you an apology, sir.

14:41.298 --> 14:43.842
We had a report that the evil King Tut
was back in town.

14:44.051 --> 14:46.678
I'm not blaming you, Gordon.
You were doing your duty.

14:46.887 --> 14:49.348
But what about the real King Tut?

14:49.556 --> 14:51.600
No doubt this subterfuge
was part of his plot.

14:51.809 --> 14:53.560
He may be at the ball at this moment.

14:53.769 --> 14:55.396
Go back there, men. On the double.

14:55.604 --> 14:58.065
This time get the right king...

14:58.273 --> 15:01.902
...or you, O'Hara, and all the rest of you
will be back pounding a beat again.

15:12.788 --> 15:14.665
Mm.

15:14.873 --> 15:18.085
Would you look at her?

15:18.460 --> 15:21.797
Every inch a queen.

15:22.005 --> 15:25.342
Mm.

15:33.684 --> 15:35.185
You're right, it's Tut.

15:35.394 --> 15:37.813
We'll play this cautiously, Dick.
Watch and wait.

15:38.021 --> 15:40.023
Do you boys know that man?

15:40.232 --> 15:42.484
If he's who we think he is, we do.

15:42.693 --> 15:44.736
And if we do, we'll deal with him.

15:47.197 --> 15:48.782
- Mr. Wayne?
-Yes.

15:48.991 --> 15:50.284
We're from the police.

15:50.492 --> 15:53.454
We've been ordered to apprehend
the man disguised as King Tut.

15:53.662 --> 15:56.206
- Oh, yes, I know.
-ls something wrong?

15:56.415 --> 15:57.791
Don't worry, Aunt Harriet.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.668
Well spoken, noble mark.

15:59.877 --> 16:02.379
- We've got a plan, if you'll help us.
-Of course.

16:02.588 --> 16:04.173
See those men over there?

16:04.756 --> 16:06.175
They're also police.

16:07.050 --> 16:10.846
The king seems to be attracted
to the queen, Cleopatra.

16:11.054 --> 16:12.723
You can say that again.

16:12.931 --> 16:15.434
If you can get the young lady
to dance with the king...

16:15.642 --> 16:17.352
...steer him over to that exit...

16:17.561 --> 16:21.607
...we could capture him quietly
without disturbing the others.

16:22.232 --> 16:24.026
I'll try to oblige.

16:24.234 --> 16:26.904
By your leave, Your Highness.

16:44.963 --> 16:47.299
It's an honor to dance with you,
Your Majesty.

16:47.508 --> 16:49.259
I know it is.

16:49.468 --> 16:51.470
Not every young girl gets a chance...

16:51.678 --> 16:55.140
...to wrap her arms around the king.

16:55.349 --> 16:56.808
Oh!

17:04.775 --> 17:06.902
My, what a short dance.

17:07.109 --> 17:10.446
Yes, it isn't like Lisa
to go off with a stranger.

17:12.907 --> 17:14.785
Mr. Wayne, have you seen King Tut?

17:14.992 --> 17:16.744
Yes, the police just took him away.

17:16.954 --> 17:18.247
Or did they?

17:18.454 --> 17:20.415
- We're the police.
-Notify the commissioner.

17:20.624 --> 17:21.875
Dick, come on.

17:23.710 --> 17:27.214
Mercy gracious sakes alive.

17:34.304 --> 17:36.390
I placed a tracking device
in Lisa's clothes, Robin.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.310
See here?

17:42.187 --> 17:44.147
Watch closely.

17:47.067 --> 17:50.737
It stopped. We've zeroed in on them, Robin.

17:56.326 --> 17:58.954
Commissioner,
you've heard the news, of course.

17:59.162 --> 18:01.039
We've located the royal palace.

18:01.248 --> 18:04.585
Undoubtedly, King Tut
has taken Miss Carson there.

18:04.793 --> 18:06.211
The Pyramid Club.

18:06.420 --> 18:10.340
A shuttered roadhouse
in an underdeveloped suburb.

18:10.674 --> 18:13.302
I'm sorry. Robin and I had better attempt
this one ourselves.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.178
A girl's life is in danger.

18:15.387 --> 18:19.182
This mission has
to be accomplished quietly.

18:24.855 --> 18:28.191
<i>NARRATOR". But in his hideout
in the shuttered Pyramid Club...</i>

18:28.400 --> 18:31.028
<i>...King Tut plans some noise of his own.</i>

18:31.695 --> 18:34.239
But I'm not Cleopatra.

18:34.448 --> 18:36.074
I'm Lisa Carson.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.327
I live right here in Gotham City...

18:38.535 --> 18:41.330
...on the fashionable lower east part
of the Upper West Side.

18:41.997 --> 18:44.791
Your home is on the Nile.

18:45.375 --> 18:48.879
I've never been to the Nile,
and I'm never going.

18:49.087 --> 18:51.632
Fate and I will take you there.

18:52.382 --> 18:54.843
Look, if this is some kind of a joke,
I've had enough.

18:55.052 --> 18:56.428
Who are you, anyway'?

18:56.637 --> 18:58.680
Who am I? Heh, heh.

18:58.889 --> 19:01.850
Tut! Master of Thebes, King of the Nile...

19:02.059 --> 19:04.269
...moon god of Thoth.

19:04.478 --> 19:06.688
And that's just on Mama's side of the family.

19:06.897 --> 19:09.775
I have a wealthy father,
and he'll pay anything to let me go.

19:10.567 --> 19:13.695
There's not enough money in all the world...

19:13.904 --> 19:19.660
...to rob me of the rapture
of having my queen by my side forever.

19:19.868 --> 19:22.788
You're not going to have me
by your side ever.

19:23.872 --> 19:25.832
I wonder how a little stay...

19:26.041 --> 19:29.169
...in the royal dungeon would affect you.

19:29.378 --> 19:32.589
Strange how that clammy enclosure...

19:32.798 --> 19:36.009
...can have a warming effect on people.

19:36.218 --> 19:38.553
Jester! Lord Chancellor!

20:08.250 --> 20:09.751
Bolted tight.

20:09.960 --> 20:13.255
- Should we try the Batmelter on the lock'?
-No, we must find other means.

20:13.463 --> 20:17.968
You stay here and watch the door.
I'll see what I can find above.

20:24.141 --> 20:26.435
Mission accomplished, Your Highness.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.103
She's locked up, all right.

20:28.311 --> 20:30.605
Though it sure seems like a waste of money.

20:30.814 --> 20:32.774
Though it's none of my business, I guess.

20:32.983 --> 20:37.571
Hmm? You're right, royal jester,
it's none of your business...

20:37.779 --> 20:40.198
...and that's no guess.

20:59.176 --> 21:02.888
If that girl in the dungeon ain't kidding,
there could be a fortune in this.

21:08.018 --> 21:10.604
Well, what do you know,
the first robin of spring.

21:10.812 --> 21:12.647
Let's take him to the head birdwatcher...

21:12.856 --> 21:14.983
...the king himself.

21:22.365 --> 21:25.786
Oh. A bird of prey.

21:25.994 --> 21:27.370
Tie him up!

21:27.579 --> 21:30.290
Stop! Wait a minute.

21:30.499 --> 21:31.875
If the Caped Crumb is here...

21:32.083 --> 21:34.503
...the Cowled Creep can't be far behind.

21:34.711 --> 21:36.129
That's right, Tut.

22:19.714 --> 22:21.091
Now...

22:21.299 --> 22:23.468
...what shall we do
with our mortal enemies...

22:23.677 --> 22:25.887
...who shan't be mortal much longer?

22:26.096 --> 22:28.640
Hmm... Hmm... Ah.

22:28.849 --> 22:30.976
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

22:31.184 --> 22:33.770
For the moment,
we'll leave Boy Wonder tied up...

22:33.979 --> 22:36.398
...to decide his ultimate fate.

22:36.606 --> 22:38.400
But as for Batman...

22:38.608 --> 22:42.737
...open the royal sarcophagus.

22:44.739 --> 22:47.284
Put him in it.

22:49.452 --> 22:53.957
Friends, Egyptians, henchmen...

22:54.165 --> 22:56.960
...lend me your ears.

22:57.168 --> 23:02.090
I come to bury Batman, not to praise him.

23:02.299 --> 23:05.385
The evil that men do lives after them.

23:05.594 --> 23:08.680
The good is oft interred with their bones.

23:08.889 --> 23:12.225
So let it be with Batman.

23:32.996 --> 23:37.542
It isn't that I love you any less, Batman.

23:37.751 --> 23:42.088
Simply that I love me more. Hmm?

23:47.969 --> 23:50.805
Bubble, bubble, little bat...

23:51.014 --> 23:53.683
...at the bottom of the vat.

23:54.267 --> 23:58.396
Your wings will dry and soon you'll fly...

23:58.605 --> 24:03.568
...to the great big belfry in the sky.
