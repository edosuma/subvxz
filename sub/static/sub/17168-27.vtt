00:28.227 --> 00:31.530
(SIGHS) What a beautiful
Easter morning.

00:31.532 --> 00:32.798
As he does every year,

00:32.800 --> 00:34.900
the Easter Bunny
has hidden a variety

00:34.902 --> 00:36.635
of Easter eggs
across the yard.

00:36.637 --> 00:40.038
Ooh! The plastic eggs of color
with the candy yolks!

00:40.040 --> 00:42.274
Now, the Easter Bunny
has gone to great lengths

00:42.276 --> 00:44.076
to hide these eggs
in plain sight.

00:44.078 --> 00:46.511
Be on the lookout for them,
poking out from behind bushes,

00:46.513 --> 00:48.013
sitting inside
the groove of a tire swing

00:48.015 --> 00:50.148
or lying in the
not-so-tall grass.

00:50.150 --> 00:51.550
What are we waiting for?

00:51.552 --> 00:53.652
Let's do this!

00:55.355 --> 00:56.788
Ooh! Ooh!

00:57.156 --> 00:58.957
Oh.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.826
Come on, come on, come on,
where are the eggs?

01:03.696 --> 01:04.796
Oh! Oh!

01:05.298 --> 01:06.565
Oh.

01:08.201 --> 01:09.701
Ha! Oh.

01:11.070 --> 01:12.704
Huh! Huh!

01:14.240 --> 01:15.807
Oh, man!

01:20.713 --> 01:22.381
-Hmm.
-Ooh! Ohh!

01:22.383 --> 01:25.016
Uh, uh, guys, I found one!

01:25.018 --> 01:26.051
Ooh!

01:26.053 --> 01:28.620
Wait, never mind.
It's a dog poop.

STARFIRE: (EXCLAIMS)

01:30.224 --> 01:31.523
Look.

01:31.525 --> 01:33.592
I found one egg
that the Bunny Easter

01:33.594 --> 01:35.026
neglected to color.

01:38.231 --> 01:40.499
(CHOKES AND COUGHS)

01:41.334 --> 01:43.602
That was not the Easter egg.

01:44.804 --> 01:46.238
(CHIRPS)

01:46.240 --> 01:47.739
Maybe instead of candy eggs,

01:47.741 --> 01:50.142
the Easter Bunny hid dog poops
and tiny birds.

01:50.144 --> 01:51.343
Well, I'll collect tiny birds

01:51.345 --> 01:52.844
but I'm not collecting
dog poops.

01:52.846 --> 01:55.647
Titans! I've scoured
every inch of the island.

01:55.649 --> 01:57.516
There is not
a single Easter egg.

01:57.518 --> 01:59.017
In fact, there is no evidence

01:59.019 --> 02:00.852
that the Easter Bunny
was here at all.

02:00.854 --> 02:01.920
(ALL GASP)

02:01.922 --> 02:03.922
No Easter eggs?

No Easter baskets?

02:05.058 --> 02:07.926
No rabbits encased
in the chocolates?

-Lots of dog poops!
-(BUZZING)

02:10.431 --> 02:12.631
Titans, I fear
something terrible

02:12.633 --> 02:14.299
has happened
to the holiday hare.

02:14.301 --> 02:17.569
And if we don't find him,
Easter will be ruined!

02:17.571 --> 02:18.970
Titans, go!

02:20.339 --> 02:21.907
(BRAKES SCREECHING)

02:21.909 --> 02:24.176
I just realized I have no idea
where we're going.

02:24.178 --> 02:25.911
Does anyone know where the
Easter Bunny lives?

02:25.913 --> 02:27.913
Ah, uh, a hole in the ground?

02:27.915 --> 02:29.014
Yes, but where?

02:29.016 --> 02:30.148
Uh, Easter Island?

02:30.150 --> 02:31.883
That place has nothing to do
with Easter!

02:31.885 --> 02:34.653
How is it we know every detail
about Santa,

02:34.655 --> 02:36.888
<i>how much he weighs,</i>
<i>his facial skin conditions,</i>

02:36.890 --> 02:38.723
<i>the occasional ups and downs</i>
<i>with his wife.</i>

02:38.725 --> 02:41.026
Yet, we know nothing about
the Easter Bunny.

02:41.028 --> 02:42.294
I think he has pink fur

02:42.296 --> 02:44.229
<i>and hangs out with</i>
<i>baby marshmallow chickens.</i>

02:44.231 --> 02:46.765

02:49.937 --> 02:52.404

Uh, that's disgusting, Star.

02:54.808 --> 02:57.442
-Keep those
thoughts to yourself.
-I apologize.

02:57.444 --> 02:59.144
All right, new plan!

03:01.180 --> 03:03.348
Since our intel
on the Easter Bunny
is limited.

03:03.350 --> 03:06.685
I've rounded up a few of his
known holiday associates.

03:08.754 --> 03:10.655
Even if they know
where the bunny is,

03:10.657 --> 03:12.057
who says they'll talk?

03:12.059 --> 03:13.692
They'll talk.

03:17.363 --> 03:19.498
Listen, here, you fat baby.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.433
Tell us where

and you can go home.
