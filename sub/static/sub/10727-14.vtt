Girls!

00:32.767 --> 00:34.466
What is it, Professor?

00:34.502 --> 00:36.702
Well, the house has been feeling
a bit cluttered lately,

00:36.737 --> 00:39.538
so I thought we could do
a little spring cleaning!

00:39.573 --> 00:42.541
Spring cleaning?
But, Professor, it's fall!

00:42.576 --> 00:45.711
I know, Bubbles.
I'm flipping the script!

00:45.746 --> 00:48.247
Hi-larious.

00:48.282 --> 00:49.815
I've already put all the things

00:49.850 --> 00:51.683
we need to organize
in this pile.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.886
You just need to decide
what to do with it.

00:53.921 --> 00:55.387
Ooh! I know!

00:55.423 --> 00:58.490
We can put the stuff
we wanna keep in this box.

00:58.526 --> 01:01.193
And the stuff we wanna toss
in this one!

01:01.228 --> 01:02.461
Two options?

01:02.496 --> 01:04.863
That's so... bilateral!

01:04.899 --> 01:06.799
Allow me to take charge.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.567
No, Blossom.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.903
I want the three of you
to work together on this one.

01:10.938 --> 01:12.638
Now I'm going to go
run some errands.

01:12.673 --> 01:13.839
Oh!

01:13.874 --> 01:15.307
And don't worry about this pile.

01:15.342 --> 01:16.542
There's some potentially
dangerous stuff in there

01:16.577 --> 01:18.143
from the lab.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.845
I'll go through it on my own.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.682
Bye, girls.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.651
All right, girls!
Let's get...

01:25.686 --> 01:27.719
Whooo!
Check these out!

01:27.755 --> 01:30.622
Old "Space Towtruck" movies
form the '70s!

01:30.658 --> 01:32.624
Let's get this done fast
so we can watch 'em!

01:32.660 --> 01:35.694
As long as I can wear
this shirt and this scrunchie.

01:35.729 --> 01:38.730
Let's get this party started!

01:40.234 --> 01:42.668
When I say keep, you say toss!

01:42.703 --> 01:45.270
- Keep!
- Toss!

01:45.306 --> 01:46.872
- Keep!
- Toss!

01:46.907 --> 01:48.307
No!

01:48.342 --> 01:49.875
No keep! No toss!

01:49.910 --> 01:51.210
Can't you see?

01:51.245 --> 01:52.878
Two piles aren't enough!

01:52.913 --> 01:54.313
- They're not?
- They're not?

01:54.348 --> 01:55.481
Not unless you want

01:55.516 --> 01:57.616
to give something away
by accident.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.188
She's right!

02:03.224 --> 02:05.424
We need a system
that categorizes items

02:05.459 --> 02:06.725
from most to least important.

02:07.862 --> 02:11.497
Behold!
My 19-point plan!

02:11.532 --> 02:13.632
Did you just make that?

02:13.667 --> 02:14.833
Whoa, dude!

02:14.869 --> 02:16.635
Professor told us
to work together!

02:16.670 --> 02:18.604
And we are
working together...

02:18.639 --> 02:19.905
by following my plan!

02:19.940 --> 02:22.941
Trust me,
it'll be done in a jiffy.

02:22.977 --> 02:27.846
Regular coasters, check.
Irregular coasters, check.

02:27.882 --> 02:30.315
Red car missing wheels
on accident...

02:30.351 --> 02:31.483
Hmm.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.452
Red car missing wheels
on purpose.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.287
Hmm.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.756
Hmm.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.226
Uhh? Huh?

02:41.262 --> 02:42.794
Grrrr!

02:42.830 --> 02:44.429
Uh?

02:45.699 --> 02:46.832
Uhh? Huh?

02:51.705 --> 02:55.908
I don't know!
I just don't know!

02:55.943 --> 02:58.777
Bubbles, your break
isn't for another 15 minutes!

02:58.812 --> 03:00.279
Blossom, this stinks!

03:00.314 --> 03:02.247
Your crazy system
makes no sense!

03:02.283 --> 03:04.349
Yes, it does.
You're just not doing it right.

03:04.385 --> 03:05.617
Admit it, dude.

03:05.653 --> 03:07.352
Bubbles and my idea
was way better.

03:07.388 --> 03:09.988
No.
You just don't get it.

03:10.024 --> 03:12.291
I'll do it myself,
and you'll see.

03:12.326 --> 03:13.392
Cool.

03:13.427 --> 03:14.760
Uh, cool?

03:14.795 --> 03:16.628
Cool!
Less work for us.

03:16.664 --> 03:19.431
Don't come crawling back
when you get in over your head.

03:19.466 --> 03:21.633
Come on, Bubbs.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.402
Let's go watch
"Space Towtruck."

03:23.437 --> 03:25.637
But where does the red car go?

03:25.673 --> 03:26.738
Hmph!

03:26.774 --> 03:27.839
I guess if you want

03:27.875 --> 03:29.041
something done right,

03:29.076 --> 03:30.909
you just have to do it yourself.

03:30.945 --> 03:32.511
Let's see what I have left.

03:32.546 --> 03:33.546
Aha!

03:34.915 --> 03:38.784
The Professor said
to leave this pile alone.

03:38.819 --> 03:41.987
Then again, if he sees how well
I organize his stuff,

03:42.022 --> 03:44.056
he'll make my way
the house rule.

03:44.091 --> 03:47.459
Besides, he clearly left
a flashlight on in this one.

03:52.866 --> 03:53.899
Huh?

03:55.035 --> 03:57.302
Food!

03:57.338 --> 03:58.604
Oh, man!

03:58.639 --> 04:01.373
Gruyère cheese, hamburgers,
yogurt,

04:01.408 --> 04:03.575
and imitation crab meat!

04:05.713 --> 04:06.713
What are you doing?!

04:08.048 --> 04:10.482
Oooh!
Perfect selfie lighting!

04:12.019 --> 04:13.385
What?

04:13.420 --> 04:15.587
Yo, this mirror
doesn't work at all,

04:15.623 --> 04:16.822
So I smashed it.

04:16.857 --> 04:19.423
That's not a mirror!
That's a TV!

04:22.396 --> 04:23.996
My piles!

04:24.031 --> 04:26.732
My perfectly organized piles!

04:26.767 --> 04:28.934
Hey, what's going on here?

04:28.969 --> 04:32.371
We've been stuck in that box
for over 3,000 years.

04:32.406 --> 04:35.007
And some mortal just let us out!

04:35.042 --> 04:36.875
Wait.
I let you out, but...

04:36.910 --> 04:38.076
You!?
You!?

04:38.112 --> 04:39.444
Guys! Guys!

04:39.480 --> 04:40.979
This is the girl
who set us free...

04:41.015 --> 04:43.348
So we can take over
the world tomorrow!

04:43.384 --> 04:44.816
Take over the world?

04:44.852 --> 04:47.686
She is the evilest girl of all!

04:47.721 --> 04:48.887
Me?

04:48.922 --> 04:50.989
But before
we take over the world,

04:51.025 --> 04:54.126

You're gonna party!

07:31.785 --> 07:33.151
Wow.

07:33.187 --> 07:35.987

08:11.358 --> 08:14.926

monsters back in that box!

08:14.962 --> 08:17.796
And that girl
is the only one who knows how.

08:17.831 --> 08:21.266
Blossom, we can help you out,
but you need to trust us.

08:21.301 --> 08:23.134

Whatever.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.670

she'll get her to talk.

08:31.411 --> 08:33.211
I'm back!

08:33.246 --> 08:36.581
One... Hope likes animals
as much as I do.

08:36.616 --> 08:38.582
Two... she won't get off
the trampoline.

08:38.619 --> 08:41.785
Three... she said all we have
to do to send the monsters back,

08:41.822 --> 08:44.155
is get them to say,
"Ta lémé."

08:44.191 --> 08:45.924
It means "see ya later"
in Greek.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.859
See?
Bubbs rocks.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.327
Okay.
Let's do plan...

08:49.363 --> 08:50.996
You said you'd listen to us.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.063
Yeah, but plan...

08:52.099 --> 08:53.198
Listen to us.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.667
Fine.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.970
All right, Bubbs.
You know what to do.

09:02.109 --> 09:03.208
All right.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.310
Who wants to turn this party up?

09:07.648 --> 09:12.050
Now, it's an honor
to introduce to you...

09:12.085 --> 09:19.758
the one and only
M.C. Evil Girl!

09:24.164 --> 09:26.731
Bring the hype.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.000
How?

09:29.036 --> 09:31.069
Hey, Bubbles!

09:31.104 --> 09:33.805
When I say "keep",
you say "toss!"

09:33.840 --> 09:35.707
- Keep!
- Toss!

09:35.742 --> 09:38.043
- Keep!
- Toss!

09:38.078 --> 09:39.277
Right!

09:39.313 --> 09:40.845
All right, everyone.

09:40.881 --> 09:43.114
When I say "evil",
you say "girl!"

09:43.150 --> 09:45.350

- Girl!

09:45.385 --> 09:47.752

09:47.788 --> 09:50.655

09:56.530 --> 09:58.096
- Pop!
- Quiz!

09:58.131 --> 10:00.098

10:01.468 --> 10:03.001
Oh, yeah!

10:03.036 --> 10:05.670
When I say "hey,"
you say "Ta lémé"!

10:05.706 --> 10:07.872
- Hey! Hey!
- Ta lémé!

10:07.908 --> 10:10.241
- Hey! Hey!
- Ta lémé!

10:10.277 --> 10:12.877
- Hey! Hey!
- Ta lémé!

10:12.913 --> 10:14.312
Wait a sec.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.222
We did it! We did it! We did it!
