00:27.894 --> 00:29.691
<i>Every time I hold you</i>

00:32.098 --> 00:33.929
<i>There's a feeling</i>

00:35.869 --> 00:38.929
<i>You know, it's a
feeling that pulls me in</i>

00:39.005 --> 00:42.600
<i>Deeper and deeper into your mind</i>

00:44.077 --> 00:46.602
<i>Every time</i>

00:46.679 --> 00:51.343
<i>And I want more and
more until they stop</i>

00:51.418 --> 00:54.615
<i>Oh, there's something
about you, baby</i>

00:55.655 --> 00:58.055
<i>You're all I need</i>

00:58.124 --> 01:02.561
<i>Slip into somethingmore comfortable.
Hawksin Hotels.</i>

01:04.230 --> 01:07.563
<i>You're everything to me</i>

01:09.536 --> 01:12.699
We think it really brands the chain.

01:12.772 --> 01:16.173
Hedonistic opulence, pampering.

01:17.177 --> 01:21.007
The place to go when
you're with someone special.

01:24.217 --> 01:25.775
Well, I think it's perfect.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.419
If, by "perfect," you mean low-rent porn

01:29.489 --> 01:32.083
that's completely inappropriate
for me or my hotels.

01:32.158 --> 01:33.216
Even the chocolate was naked.

01:33.293 --> 01:35.693
- We could lose the chocolate.
- Why are you speaking?

01:35.762 --> 01:37.992
- Stop speaking. Why is he speaking?
- I don't know.

01:38.064 --> 01:40.225
You know what let's do?
When I'm speaking, you stop speaking.

01:40.300 --> 01:41.733
- Right.
- He did it again.

01:47.273 --> 01:48.262
Mike?

01:50.143 --> 01:51.167
Well put.

01:51.244 --> 01:52.836
Look, fellows,
I don't want my customers thinking

01:52.912 --> 01:55.142
about what their bed was doing
before they got in it.

01:55.215 --> 01:57.240
On the good side,
the pastries were delicious.

01:57.317 --> 01:58.682
<i>Amici.</i>

02:00.053 --> 02:01.384
<i>Avanti.</i>

02:04.324 --> 02:05.348
Mr. Hawksin?

02:05.558 --> 02:07.958
The passion angle was something that
we decided on months ago.

02:08.026 --> 02:09.687
Apparently, we define
the word differently.

02:09.762 --> 02:12.060
Have you ever even stayed
at a Hawksin hotel?

02:12.132 --> 02:14.930
Because judging from what I saw in there,
you have no idea what we believe in.

02:15.001 --> 02:19.870
I've never actually stayed
in a Hawksin hotel per se, but...

02:19.939 --> 02:21.429
And what about the international angle?

02:21.508 --> 02:23.408
We decided we would go
for global business.

02:23.476 --> 02:26.934
Exactly. I'm with you, sir. Great idea.

02:27.013 --> 02:32.110
Today's business needs to attract
a wider customer base.

02:32.185 --> 02:35.154
- Please, sir, we can do this.
- Again with the talking.

02:35.221 --> 02:40.249
All right, this isn't the first time
a tryst in a hotel room didn't go well.

02:40.326 --> 02:42.453
But just give us one more shot.

02:42.529 --> 02:44.588
If we don't make a commercial
that tells the whole world

02:44.664 --> 02:47.394
exactly who Hawksin Hotels really is,

02:47.467 --> 02:49.526
well, then I'll...

02:49.602 --> 02:52.230
We'll both quit the business forever.

02:53.973 --> 02:56.339
Scout's honor. You have my word.

02:57.610 --> 02:59.168
And my passion.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.447
- Passion.
- Again with the talking.

03:03.283 --> 03:04.910
You see Mike, here?

03:04.984 --> 03:10.012
He's worked for me for 37 years,
and hasn't said one word the whole time.

03:10.089 --> 03:11.113
I'll tell you what.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.455
We're opening a new five-star restaurant
at the Hawksin Grand

03:13.526 --> 03:15.289
in San Francisco next week.
You're both invited.

03:15.361 --> 03:18.023
You'll come up,
get a feel for the place, if you can.

03:18.097 --> 03:21.692
Call the office. They'll set it up.
"Leave the business."

03:21.768 --> 03:23.326
Thank you, sir.

03:26.272 --> 03:30.231
What did I tell you about the girl
climbing on the guy's lap like that?

03:30.310 --> 03:32.175
What? It was tasteful.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.545
I need to see the proofs before
you send them to LA. Before...

03:36.616 --> 03:38.140
Call Ted Stevens' new agent.
See if Ted can shoot a spot

03:38.218 --> 03:39.276
10 days from now.
Also, there was that video...

03:39.352 --> 03:40.614
Messenger the Milan samples
to Granger's apartment.

03:40.687 --> 03:41.984
...performance artist,
he was a New School graduate?

03:42.055 --> 03:43.613
- I want to see those tonight.
- I don't remember his name,

03:43.690 --> 03:44.952
- but find him and give me his reel.
- Yeah. Okay.

03:45.024 --> 03:46.082
Yeah, thanks.

03:47.927 --> 03:49.394
I've got one more shot with Hawksin.

03:49.462 --> 03:52.522
If we don't get this account, I don't
know if Charlie and I are gonna make it.

03:52.599 --> 03:53.588
Don't worry about it.

03:53.666 --> 03:56.760
International angle?
What does that even mean?

03:56.836 --> 03:59.066
You'll come up with something.
You always do.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.236
Hello. Yeah, that's me.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.742
I'm not interested.

04:08.481 --> 04:09.675
CITYone Bank.

04:10.917 --> 04:14.216
I was afraid it was another woman
who heard about your imminent success.

04:14.287 --> 04:17.255
I didn't think Emory Banks
had a jealous bone in her body.

04:17.322 --> 04:18.983
Over shoes and careers, yes.

04:19.058 --> 04:21.185
Other women, not so much.

04:23.496 --> 04:25.862
- You're amazing.
- I know.

04:27.033 --> 04:30.525
Mr. Woodruff, I'm afraid
your card's been declined.

04:30.603 --> 04:31.592
Really?

04:32.772 --> 04:35.240
Just give me a minute. Yeah?

04:35.308 --> 04:38.766
<i>Mr. Woodruff, this is Jennifer David</i>
<i>from CITYone Bank calling again.</i>

04:38.845 --> 04:41.336
<i>Please don't hang up, sir,</i>
<i>we seem to have a situation.</i>

04:41.414 --> 04:44.076
Yeah, it's more of a train wreck, actually.
I just tried to use my card.

04:44.150 --> 04:45.845
<i>We've frozen it for
your protection.</i>

04:45.918 --> 04:49.081
Our fraud division has picked up
more than $28,000 in charges

04:49.155 --> 04:51.282
within the last 10 days to your account.

04:51.357 --> 04:53.188
- Holy shit!
- What is going on?

04:53.259 --> 04:55.659
<i>- It's $28,422...</i>
- Somebody stole my card number.

04:55.728 --> 04:57.628
...and 48 cents, to be exact.

04:57.697 --> 05:00.257
<i>- So I take it these aren't yours?</i>
- Yeah.

05:00.333 --> 05:02.358
- I mean, no, no.
- That should work.

05:02.435 --> 05:03.629
- Hey, hold on.
- Thank you.

05:03.703 --> 05:05.933
I've got this.
Just give me a minute.

05:06.005 --> 05:07.495
- Mr. Granger?
- Yeah.

05:07.573 --> 05:09.734
I just need to verify
some of these charges.

05:10.276 --> 05:14.144
Jessica, this isn't really a good time.
Why don't you call me tomorrow morning?

05:14.213 --> 05:16.579
It's Jennifer, actually.

05:17.016 --> 05:19.746
<i>Jennifer David.
And I can call you then.</i>

05:20.286 --> 05:21.548
<i>Please don't try to use your...</i>

05:22.755 --> 05:24.052
Let's go.

05:39.739 --> 05:41.934
Doesn't little Granger want
to come out and play?

05:42.008 --> 05:43.407
No. Little Granger's tired.

05:48.548 --> 05:50.607
Sorry, it's probably work.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.847
- Hello?
<i>- Mr. Woodruff?</i>

05:52.919 --> 05:54.853
- Speaking.
<i>- This is Jennifer David</i>

05:54.921 --> 05:57.355
<i>from CITYone Bank Card.
It's 8:00 AM.</i>

05:57.423 --> 05:59.323
Oh, right. My wake-up call.

05:59.392 --> 06:00.381
<i>Good morning, sir.</i>

06:00.460 --> 06:01.859
<i>- Now, we need to establish...</i>
- This is important, Em.

06:01.928 --> 06:04.590
<i>...which of these charges are fraudulent.</i>
- Do you want to get off the phone?

06:04.664 --> 06:05.892
<i>First, if you wouldn't mind</i>
<i>answering a few questions.</i>

06:05.965 --> 06:07.057
<i>Your mother's maiden name?</i>

06:07.133 --> 06:08.191
I can't believe you.
Just hang up.

06:08.267 --> 06:09.757
- Klinger. No.
- Okay.

06:09.836 --> 06:12.202
Strike that, that was
her second husband. Winslow.

06:12.271 --> 06:15.365
<i>- Is this a bad time, sir?</i>
- Yes, it is.

06:15.441 --> 06:17.773
Sorry about that, Ms. David,
that was my maid.

06:17.844 --> 06:20.779
She was being naughty. Please continue.

06:21.681 --> 06:24.844
Okay.
Can you list your last three purchases?

06:24.917 --> 06:25.941
Let's see.

06:26.719 --> 06:28.880
<i>I bought an iPod a few days ago</i>
<i>for the gym,</i>

06:28.955 --> 06:31.890
took a potential client to Pete's,
best ribs in town.

06:31.958 --> 06:34.392
You'll probably see that charge
on my card a lot.

06:34.460 --> 06:38.760
<i>Do you remember a charge of $250</i>
<i>at Lotus Florists, four days ago?</i>

06:38.831 --> 06:41.994
- I didn't get any flowers.
- No, not mine.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.935
<i>They were delivered
to a Ms. Leslie Moore.</i>

06:45.004 --> 06:47.472
- Ms. Leslie "We're just friends" Leslie?
- Em.

06:47.540 --> 06:49.667
...O- O-R-E, that's right.

06:49.742 --> 06:52.302
Her mother was sick.
She just passed the bar.

06:52.378 --> 06:55.609
- Flowers are very thoughtful.
- You're killing me here, David.

06:55.681 --> 06:59.344
- Em, you're not leaving, are you?
- Whatever.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.114
<i>- Okay, now, Mr. Woodruff...</i>
- I'm gonna have Emily come by

07:01.187 --> 07:03.485
- and get things, all right?
<i>- I'm going to fax you a print-out</i>

07:03.556 --> 07:06.491
<i>of all these charges. Circle the ones</i>
<i>that are yours, and then fax it back to me.</i>

07:07.226 --> 07:08.716
Great.

07:08.795 --> 07:11.593
At least tell me it's not raining again.
Is it nice out?

07:11.664 --> 07:14.064
I don't know, sir. I'm in San Francisco.

07:14.133 --> 07:16.567
SF, you know, City by the Bay,

07:16.636 --> 07:21.073
home of the 49ers, Golden Gate Bridge,
cable cars...

07:25.678 --> 07:26.804
May I help you?

07:33.352 --> 07:36.185
This is Jennifer David
from CITYone Bank Card calling.

07:36.255 --> 07:37.347
548...

07:37.423 --> 07:38.583
420...

07:43.029 --> 07:44.223
Call you tonight?

07:45.965 --> 07:47.956
But I need you to really try to...

07:50.236 --> 07:51.362
Please don't hang up, sir...

07:51.437 --> 07:52.699
All right, sir, I'd be happy to help you.

07:55.274 --> 07:56.866
That should take care of it for now.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.770
That's it for me.

07:59.579 --> 08:01.444
That was my 42nd hang-up tonight.

08:01.514 --> 08:05.951
I've had like four "Get lost, idiots,"
and 16 "Lose my number, morons."

08:06.018 --> 08:09.112
And I think this guy just called me
a douchebag. What's that?

08:09.188 --> 08:10.280
I don't know.

08:10.356 --> 08:13.086
I'm so happy they moved me
to Lost or Stolen.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.820
You're so lucky.

08:14.894 --> 08:17.158
Do you want to go for shopping
before it gets too crowded?

08:17.230 --> 08:19.994
- Okay.
- You know, I have to go to Vikram's house

08:20.066 --> 08:22.762
this Sunday, and Papa told me
to get a new dress.

08:22.835 --> 08:25.827
- Wow!
- He said, "Every time the Bhatias see you

08:25.905 --> 08:28.203
"in jeans, I'm afraid
they're beginning to think

08:28.274 --> 08:30.367
"that their future daughter-in-law
is a boy!"

08:31.210 --> 08:32.541
Your father has a point.

08:32.611 --> 08:35.409
Vikram comes from a very good family,
you should impress them.

08:35.481 --> 08:37.847
- You're killing me here.
- I'm what?

08:37.917 --> 08:40.111
It's a slang.
You need to pay attention in class.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.381
Teacher's pest?

09:21.527 --> 09:24.462
The toilet is going up.
You just watch it.

09:25.965 --> 09:27.023
Good, you're here.

09:27.099 --> 09:30.000
Priya, <i>beta,</i> you know
father was saying that...

09:30.069 --> 09:33.596
Mama, please, let me sleep.
Good night. Please.

09:34.273 --> 09:36.298
In that case, good night.

09:44.650 --> 09:46.914
Okay, I got one. "From the food

09:48.454 --> 09:49.978
"to the toilet paper,

09:50.790 --> 09:52.724
"Hawksin's means quality."

09:55.895 --> 09:58.022
Yeah. That's really bad.

09:59.799 --> 10:02.700
"If you're tired
and you need a place to sleep..."

10:04.003 --> 10:05.027
I've got nothing.

10:05.137 --> 10:08.368
"People who stay with Hawksin's
are smarter than when they check out,

10:08.441 --> 10:09.874
"than when they check in."

10:09.942 --> 10:12.376
No, no, no, no.
That doesn't make any sense.

10:18.618 --> 10:22.145
Govinda, go get your sister,
otherwise she'll be late for work.

10:22.221 --> 10:25.657
- Shh, Ma, I'm watching cricket.
- Govinda!

10:26.626 --> 10:29.186
Okay, okay. Priya, wake up!

10:30.029 --> 10:33.123
- Priya, you'll be late for work.
- Look at this boy, huh?

10:33.199 --> 10:34.666
- Priya!
- All the time, he's watching these

10:34.734 --> 10:35.860
- terrible programs on television.
- Yes!

10:37.003 --> 10:38.868
These cricket hoodlums.
And he behaves like that.

10:38.938 --> 10:40.872
- Good morning.
- Ah! It's your morning.

10:40.940 --> 10:43.568
It's our evening, huh?
Your dinner's almost ready.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.873
You're not wearing those boys' pants
to the Bhatias', are you?

10:45.945 --> 10:48.709
I have a dress, don't worry.
And what is this?

10:48.781 --> 10:51.909
Ah! That's a birthday present
for your father's cousin, Auntie Rani.

10:51.984 --> 10:54.145
And Govinda has to take it
to the post soon,

10:54.220 --> 10:57.383
otherwise it won't make it on time
to Palo Alto, right, Govinda?

10:57.456 --> 10:59.515
- Yeah, Ma.
- Mmm-hmm. Right.

11:00.893 --> 11:03.384
You're back? Any good news?

11:03.729 --> 11:07.460
I went all the way to Mud Island.
They were not even at home.

11:07.533 --> 11:08.830
I don't want to talk about it.

11:08.901 --> 11:11.062
- What's the score?
- 121 for six.

11:11.137 --> 11:14.402
Sounds like my day.
- Hi, Papa, how was your day?

11:14.473 --> 11:16.668
I don't want to talk about it.

11:16.742 --> 11:19.302
Another night without a family dinner.

11:19.378 --> 11:21.778
If you sat down with me now,
we could eat together.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.747
Just because you have to work
all night out

11:23.816 --> 11:26.614
doesn't mean that I have my dinner
at 5:30 in the evening.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.677
If you read <i>India Today</i> this week,

11:28.754 --> 11:31.518
it talks about
how we are the future of India.

11:31.590 --> 11:34.354
And, you know,
some 10,000 people applied for the job,

11:34.427 --> 11:37.828
and only 100 were accepted.
And I'm making good money.

11:37.897 --> 11:39.956
Even though it's not normal
for a young woman like you

11:40.032 --> 11:42.364
to work all night on the phone,
talking to strangers,

11:42.435 --> 11:45.927
- pretending to be <i>Americano.</i>
- Yes, yes!

11:47.973 --> 11:50.134
We did it! We scored!

11:50.209 --> 11:52.006
Like being Indian is so normal.

11:59.151 --> 12:00.743
All right. I got some more.

12:00.820 --> 12:04.278
- Next.
- "Our mini-bars will get you maxi-drunk."

12:04.390 --> 12:05.755
Oh, my gosh.

12:35.387 --> 12:37.514
Okay, let's start with your celebrities.

12:40.326 --> 12:41.987
Sarah Michelle Gellar.
- Sarah Michelle Gellar.

12:42.061 --> 12:43.824
Sarah Michelle Gellar. Good. Next.

12:45.664 --> 12:48.030
Sarah Jessica Parker.
- Sarah Jessica Parker.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.590
Sarah Jessica Parker. Good.

12:54.340 --> 12:58.276
Mary-Louise Parker.
That was in your handout.

12:58.978 --> 13:00.138
All right?

13:01.881 --> 13:04.213
That is Dylan...

13:04.283 --> 13:06.012
That's Dermot Mulroney,

13:06.085 --> 13:09.577
not to be confused with Dylan McDermott,
formerly of <i>The Practice.</i>

13:09.655 --> 13:11.179
Very good, Priya.

13:11.257 --> 13:16.251
Okay, tonight, I want you to study
your Jessicas and your Ryans, okay?

13:16.328 --> 13:18.956
- If somebody calls you a dawg?
- That's good.

13:19.031 --> 13:21.864
- Right, but if you dog somebody?
- That's bad.

13:21.934 --> 13:23.458
Word. Okay.

13:24.570 --> 13:29.007
Who makes the square burger?
Is it Wendy's, Burger King or McDonald's?

13:29.074 --> 13:30.507
Burger King.

13:32.211 --> 13:33.337
Wendy's, Zia.

13:34.180 --> 13:36.546
Wendy's makes the square burger.

13:37.850 --> 13:40.011
Burger King is Home of the Whopper.

13:40.085 --> 13:45.022
And McDonald's is famous
for its Quarter Pounder, with or...

13:45.324 --> 13:47.622
- Without cheese.
...without cheese. Good.

13:47.693 --> 13:49.058
- Yes, Priya.
- But many of them

13:49.128 --> 13:51.756
are starting to add salads
and low-fat chicken dishes,

13:51.831 --> 13:54.265
because of the obesity
which is plaguing the country.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.767
Good. Okay, that's it, everybody.

13:57.102 --> 14:00.367
Sunday, I want all those
from the Southwest here at 6:00, please,

14:00.439 --> 14:02.873
and Californians, Monday at 5:30,

14:02.942 --> 14:05.274
and New Jersey,
everyone here at 8:00, please.

14:05.344 --> 14:06.936
- Ms. Prasad?
- Yes, Zia.

14:07.012 --> 14:10.209
May I please move out of New Jersey?
Everyone keeps swearing at me.

14:10.282 --> 14:14.218
Zia, you know the rules.
Everyone starts in New Jersey,

14:14.286 --> 14:16.345
and works their way out.

14:18.657 --> 14:22.923
<i>Flirting with disaster</i>

14:24.330 --> 14:27.094
<i>You're the one I'm after</i>

14:27.166 --> 14:29.566
<i>Think I've found my destiny</i>

14:35.608 --> 14:39.942
<i>Luxury and danger</i>

14:40.012 --> 14:44.073
<i>Rapture me, my stranger</i>

14:44.149 --> 14:49.086
<i>Hold me close, don't let me be</i>

14:51.957 --> 14:56.189
<i>I could fly on the wings of my heart</i>

14:56.262 --> 15:00.289
<i>Deep inside, I've been falling apart</i>

15:00.366 --> 15:02.459
<i>L- L-Love</i>

15:02.534 --> 15:04.661
<i>There's a magic in you</i>

15:04.737 --> 15:08.798
<i>And I'll be under your spell</i>

15:08.874 --> 15:11.104
<i>L- L-Love</i>

15:11.644 --> 15:13.771
You are not sick.

15:13.846 --> 15:16.110
You don't have time to be sick.

15:16.181 --> 15:19.241
Therefore, you are not sick.

15:24.123 --> 15:25.147
Hello.

15:25.224 --> 15:26.657
<i>Mr. Woodruff, this is Jennifer David</i>

15:26.725 --> 15:28.750
from CITYone Bank. How are you?

15:29.194 --> 15:31.788
- I'm sick.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

15:31.864 --> 15:35.391
<i>- If this is a bad time...</i>
- No, no, no, it's fine.

15:35.467 --> 15:37.128
It's just, I'm...

15:42.841 --> 15:44.399
He's sneezing.

15:44.476 --> 15:46.774
He's allergic to you.
Just put down the phone.

15:47.346 --> 15:48.677
<i>Maybe I should call you later, sir...</i>

15:48.747 --> 15:52.114
I don't have time to be sick today, David.
I gotta nail this thing.

15:52.451 --> 15:53.816
He's building something.

15:55.054 --> 15:59.013
If you want to feel better right away
then try sucking on a lemon,

15:59.091 --> 16:02.788
then drinking a tall glass of warm water
with cardamom and fresh ginger.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.154
I'll try that.

16:06.298 --> 16:09.665
I'll call you back later, sir.
Good luck with your nailing.

16:10.703 --> 16:11.727
Bye!

16:11.904 --> 16:17.137
<i>There's a magic in you</i>
<i>and I'll be under your spell</i>

16:29.855 --> 16:32.756
- We going late tonight?
- Not tonight.

16:32.825 --> 16:36.158
I've got to get home early,
make some comfort food, get some sleep,

16:36.228 --> 16:38.093
get better for tomorrow.

16:38.163 --> 16:39.357
I got cleared for tonight,

16:39.431 --> 16:41.365
now I've got to check with Karen
about tomorrow?

16:41.433 --> 16:45.028
- Spoken like a true married man.
- Hey, it could happen to you, too.

16:45.104 --> 16:48.733
Didn't Emory make the
"Top 20 Hottest Women in New York" list?

16:48.807 --> 16:50.069
We're just having fun, pal, okay?

16:50.142 --> 16:52.406
Don't drag me
into your own little personal hell.

16:52.478 --> 16:54.639
The guys that say
they don't want to get married,

16:54.713 --> 16:57.011
they're the ones who surprise you.

16:57.082 --> 16:59.573
So, since you've been
on the wedding bandwagon since day one,

16:59.651 --> 17:01.744
you must secretly dread the actual event.

17:01.854 --> 17:05.756
- You know, there's still time to back out.
- I'm not you.

17:05.824 --> 17:08.884
What the hell are you drinking?
It smells like an Indian restaurant.

17:08.961 --> 17:11.691
Cold remedy.
Credit-card girl told me about it.

17:12.964 --> 17:15.525
Still can't believe
someone stole your identity.

17:15.601 --> 17:18.092
I mean, of all the identities out there
to steal, who'd want to steal yours?

17:19.338 --> 17:24.366
- Hope they're living large on your dime.
- Nice. Good friend.

17:43.162 --> 17:47.531
There was an attempt to use your card
for $700 at the Mystery Box.

17:47.599 --> 17:49.362
Seriously?

17:49.435 --> 17:51.801
Unless you throw in a night
with the cashier and some dolls,

17:51.870 --> 17:53.303
how do you spend that much
at a store like that?

17:53.372 --> 17:55.704
I don't know what kind
of store it is, sir.

17:55.774 --> 17:58.402
Oh, come on.
They don't have them in San Francisco?

18:02.347 --> 18:05.316
Yeah. Sure.

18:06.285 --> 18:09.584
Which is why I was certain
this wasn't your charge.

18:10.422 --> 18:12.788
Because I don't give off
a sexually adventurous vibe?

18:14.560 --> 18:15.720
No.

18:16.161 --> 18:18.561
Because you were sneezing profusely
into my eardrums

18:18.630 --> 18:21.463
about the time the charge was made.

18:21.533 --> 18:23.501
Nice work, Detective David.

18:24.002 --> 18:27.199
Okay, the big plasma TV charge,
that's mine.

18:27.272 --> 18:29.240
You know, sometimes
you just have to splurge

18:29.308 --> 18:31.776
and get yourself something
that you enjoy, live a little.

18:31.844 --> 18:34.438
Especially after a
long day at the office.

18:34.513 --> 18:37.744
I just have a cup of <i>chai.</i>
I mean, coffee.

18:39.885 --> 18:42.285
You're not fooling anyone.

18:42.354 --> 18:47.587
You Californians are all into your tofu
and your sandals.

18:47.659 --> 18:49.320
You're probably a Dead Head.

18:50.896 --> 18:52.625
Am I right, dude?

18:52.931 --> 18:55.161
Actually, I just prefer jazz.

18:56.935 --> 18:59.733
All right, here's the question.

18:59.805 --> 19:04.504
Jalapeños in your grilled cheese,
kicker or overkill?

19:08.013 --> 19:10.504
- Kicker?
- Absolutely.

19:22.161 --> 19:25.324
<i>Hello? You still there?</i>

19:28.033 --> 19:30.160
And the charge to Delicious Delights?

19:30.235 --> 19:32.465
Biggest amaretto cake known to man.

19:32.538 --> 19:34.665
My mother was having a lousy week.

19:34.740 --> 19:38.972
Sometimes you just want
to show someone you care. Right?

19:39.044 --> 19:40.602
Right.

19:40.679 --> 19:45.082
Okay, the last one. Um...
The charges from New World Video.

19:46.952 --> 19:51.013
Those were late fees.
I rented <i>The Notebook.</i> Don't laugh.

19:51.990 --> 19:55.084
Why would I laugh? I love that movie.

19:55.160 --> 19:56.593
<i>I don't normally watch chick flicks,</i>

19:56.662 --> 19:58.892
and I don't even know
if that classifies as one,

19:58.964 --> 20:02.798
but you ever watch a movie and just think
that's the way things should be?

20:03.702 --> 20:07.934
Like, someone puts themselves out there
for someone or something,

20:08.006 --> 20:11.237
and either they get it or they don't.

20:11.310 --> 20:12.572
But love's worth it.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.370
Hi, this is Courtney Reese from CITYone.
May I help you?

20:16.448 --> 20:19.042
I think that will
take care of it for now.

20:19.117 --> 20:22.575
<i>If any more charges come in,</i>
<i>I'll be in touch with you.</i>

20:22.654 --> 20:23.951
Great.

20:24.022 --> 20:27.651
I failed to mention that you qualify
for our platinum card.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.694
If you agree to a four-year term,

20:29.761 --> 20:33.094
I can get you
a very attractive interest rate.

20:33.165 --> 20:35.565
Four years? That's quite a commitment.

20:35.834 --> 20:37.529
Just think of all the
ribs you could eat, sir.

20:37.603 --> 20:38.661
You don't need to call me "sir."

20:38.737 --> 20:40.864
I mean, hell, you know more about me
than my own mother.

20:41.106 --> 20:43.006
- Granger's fine.
<i>- All right.</i>

20:43.775 --> 20:48.269
Granger, be sure to contact us
if you want an upgrade,

20:48.347 --> 20:51.839
and you should be expecting
a new card soon. Thank you.

20:55.354 --> 20:56.582
Granger?

21:01.827 --> 21:03.124
<i>Jennifer David. May I help you?</i>

21:03.195 --> 21:05.163
I just wanted to thank you
for the cold remedy.

21:05.230 --> 21:09.360
<i>It really did the trick.</i>
<i>It's me, Granger, by the way.</i>

21:09.434 --> 21:13.962
I'm so glad. I was actually going to ask
how you were feeling.

21:14.039 --> 21:16.769
Well, we do what we can do to help, sir.

21:20.612 --> 21:22.375
<i>Granger, good night.</i>

21:25.083 --> 21:26.778
Be careful, Priya.

21:38.797 --> 21:41.357
- No, Papa.
- I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry.

21:51.443 --> 21:54.844
Eh? This is the bathroom.

21:54.913 --> 21:56.278
Do you need to use it?

21:56.348 --> 21:57.940
- Have a look.
- No.

21:59.685 --> 22:03.485
This is my bedroom. Our bedroom.

22:04.556 --> 22:08.219
We're buying a brand-new double bed
with a brass headboard.

22:08.293 --> 22:11.751
- Mother has already picked it out.
- Yes.

22:12.931 --> 22:14.626
Oh! Uh...

22:15.734 --> 22:19.966
Perhaps one day we'll have our own house
if we both work hard enough.

22:22.274 --> 22:24.469
But we wouldn't have
my mother's fine cooking every day.

22:25.677 --> 22:28.737
- She has many things to teach you.
- Yes.

22:35.087 --> 22:38.488
So what sort of things do you like to do?

22:38.557 --> 22:41.424
You know,
if you could live your life any way,

22:41.493 --> 22:43.484
what would you want?

22:43.562 --> 22:47.692
I'm pretty content
with things as they are.

22:47.766 --> 22:49.529
Once I'm married...

22:50.936 --> 22:54.303
We're married, I'll have everything.

22:55.240 --> 22:58.732
A wife at home,
a beautifully tended garden,

22:59.978 --> 23:03.175
when you're not busy
with our children, of course.

23:04.750 --> 23:09.312
I love my job.
And as for children, I'm only 22.

23:10.555 --> 23:14.992
There is time for us to live a little,
don't you think so?

23:16.194 --> 23:18.856
But we will live a lot right here.

23:32.978 --> 23:38.473
Look at that. That's not sexy?
That's what spots are these days, sex.

23:39.851 --> 23:43.878
I have some vacation time,
so I was thinking.

23:43.955 --> 23:45.286
I'm gonna go with you on your trip.

23:45.357 --> 23:49.521
Oh, and I thought that I...
Well, I thought that I could wear these.

23:53.298 --> 23:54.629
You don't want to go.

23:54.699 --> 23:59.500
You know, it's gonna be cold, foggy.
I'll be in a hotel room all day.

23:59.604 --> 24:02.630
You're gonna need
some in-room entertainment.

24:02.707 --> 24:04.607
I'm on business, Emory.

24:05.610 --> 24:08.636
This account is important to us.
I can't be...

24:11.183 --> 24:12.275
Fine.

24:14.419 --> 24:16.910
- Fine.
- Em, I'm sorry.

24:16.988 --> 24:21.823
No, you know what? Actually, I think
I'll take Mark Bailey up on his lunch.

24:23.195 --> 24:26.528
I think he has a jet that he takes
to his oceanfront in Bermuda.

24:26.598 --> 24:29.795
- You're trying to tell me something here?
- Yeah.

24:29.868 --> 24:32.098
Nobody says no to Emory Banks.

24:38.076 --> 24:39.634
<i>He has an amazing voice,</i>

24:39.711 --> 24:44.080
<i>he says the most interesting things,</i>
<i>he's funny,</i>

24:44.149 --> 24:45.707
<i>and he has such kind eyes.</i>

24:45.784 --> 24:49.083
You looked up his picture?
- What if we were really soul mates?

24:49.154 --> 24:51.952
Listen, you're just anxious about Vikram.

24:52.090 --> 24:55.457
Trust me. When I was marrying Babu,
I thought my life was gonna end.

24:55.560 --> 24:59.223
I mean, how can two people who
don't even know each other get married?

24:59.297 --> 25:01.663
But then, a few months later,
we were laughing

25:01.733 --> 25:07.603
at something really silly I'd done,
and I realized I'd fallen in love with him.

25:07.672 --> 25:09.867
How sweet.

25:09.941 --> 25:14.605
And it's easier than falling in love
with some random voice on the phone.

25:14.679 --> 25:18.274
And seriously, this guy lives in America.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.012
- There's no point.
- I know.

25:28.493 --> 25:29.551
I've got to meet Karen.

25:29.628 --> 25:32.688
Oh, and she made me swear
there'd be no strippers

25:32.764 --> 25:34.527
at the bachelor party.

25:34.599 --> 25:39.298
Well, if Karen said no strippers,
that means no strippers.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.566
Only, I really want strippers.

25:44.843 --> 25:48.210
She didn't say anything
about exotic dancers, did she?

25:48.280 --> 25:49.542
No, she did not.

25:55.253 --> 25:57.687
Mr. Granger, what can I do for you?

25:57.756 --> 26:01.192
Hey, I just wanted to alert you
a future charge.

26:01.259 --> 26:04.626
When Exotic Minx shows up, that's mine.

26:05.163 --> 26:06.528
I think a pet should make you happy.

26:07.699 --> 26:08.757
Do I seem sad?

26:09.134 --> 26:12.626
Not always, but, you know,
you buy a lot of things,

26:12.704 --> 26:15.605
and people do that
to make themselves happy.

26:16.641 --> 26:18.734
<i>- I eat chocolate.</i>
- Thanks, Doc.

26:19.177 --> 26:21.145
I'm actually hiring dancers
for a bachelor party.

26:21.212 --> 26:22.509
You know, before the big wedding.

26:24.015 --> 26:25.175
Are you getting married?

26:25.450 --> 26:27.611
Me? No, no, no, no.
It's for my buddy, Charlie.

26:28.787 --> 26:30.721
Party's probably gonna cost
a couple grand.

26:30.789 --> 26:34.987
Wow! So what happens
at these bachelor parties?

26:35.594 --> 26:37.687
The usual things you hear about.

26:37.829 --> 26:41.356
But, really, it's just a symbolic,
platonic representation

26:41.433 --> 26:44.163
<i>of the last adventure</i>
<i>before one commits to marriage.</i>

26:44.903 --> 26:48.202
I think it's actually a necessary journey,
a rite of passage, if you will.

26:48.473 --> 26:51.306
- I think everyone should have one.
<i>- Me, too.</i>

26:53.211 --> 26:56.703
Hey, listen, I'm going
to San Francisco next week for work,

26:56.781 --> 27:00.376
and, you know, I thought maybe we could
get together and discuss my options.

27:02.721 --> 27:04.916
Financial things can get so complicated
over the phone.

27:05.023 --> 27:07.856
It's not really company policy
to do these things in person.

27:07.926 --> 27:11.293
<i>Aren't you supposed to keep</i>
<i>the customer satisfied?</i>

27:12.831 --> 27:15.356
Yeah, we love to satisfy,

27:15.433 --> 27:19.096
but I may not be
in San Francisco next week.

27:19.571 --> 27:21.436
I may be in...

27:23.608 --> 27:26.475
I may be out of town
for a relative's birthday.

27:28.947 --> 27:31.415
I have to go back to work now.

27:32.050 --> 27:35.850
Okay. Well, you know,
you have my number if you stay in town.

27:37.188 --> 27:40.089
Wow!
You can really see David Bowie tonight.

27:40.759 --> 27:42.989
- Sorry?
<i>- In the moon. You've never heard that?</i>

27:43.328 --> 27:45.728
You know, when there's a full moon,
you can see David Bowie's face.

27:47.432 --> 27:49.764
Always...
Well, I thought it was Mick Jagger.

27:50.135 --> 27:53.696
No, no, no. It's clearly Bowie.
You know, the cheekbones, the chin.

27:53.772 --> 27:56.536
Well, thank you for using CITYone Bank.

27:58.276 --> 27:59.766
Have a nice day.

28:01.079 --> 28:02.410
Good night.

28:15.894 --> 28:17.555
To the guy who said
he's never been anywhere,

28:17.629 --> 28:20.792
I give you, Charlie Hendricks, the world.

28:20.865 --> 28:22.662
Miss Russia.

28:22.734 --> 28:25.601
- I'm from Ukraine.
- She's from Ukraine.

28:27.205 --> 28:28.263
Miss Japan.

28:34.145 --> 28:37.444
Miss...
From somewhere where they wear clogs.

28:38.083 --> 28:40.210
No, no, no, no. This guy.

28:43.755 --> 28:46.588
You deserve it, buddy.
You deserve the world.

28:46.658 --> 28:47.989
Charlie!

28:48.059 --> 28:49.788
Ladies, come on in.

29:00.271 --> 29:01.602
Thank you.

29:07.445 --> 29:11.711
- Oh. That's too much.
- I'll pay, <i>Baba.</i>

29:13.118 --> 29:14.312
Don't be ridiculous.

29:14.385 --> 29:17.115
Why not let her?
She makes more than you.

29:27.398 --> 29:28.558
Aha!

29:28.633 --> 29:30.999
You will make a beautiful bride.

29:33.238 --> 29:34.865
Thank you, <i>Baba.</i>

29:36.407 --> 29:40.935
We'll take it. Oh, my <i>beta.</i>

29:45.650 --> 29:47.140
- Hello?
- Granger?

29:48.219 --> 29:51.052
- Jennifer!
- Sounds like you're having fun.

29:51.122 --> 29:52.487
Oh, it's a full-on rager.

29:53.825 --> 29:55.725
<i>It's Charlie's big night,</i>

29:55.794 --> 29:57.284
and the natives are a bit restless.

29:57.362 --> 30:01.196
Next week, it turns out that I will
be able to meet you before the party,

30:01.266 --> 30:05.293
so we can discuss the upgrade
we were talking about

30:06.137 --> 30:08.765
when we were talking, before.

30:08.940 --> 30:10.305
<i>That sounds great.</i>

30:10.809 --> 30:12.299
I'd like that.

30:13.011 --> 30:15.445
- It's the credit-card girl.
- Nice.

30:16.147 --> 30:17.876
I'll be in San Francisco on Thursday,

30:17.949 --> 30:21.316
so maybe we can meet
at the Hawksin Grand Hotel?

30:22.120 --> 30:23.280
<i>- You know where that is?</i>
- Word.

30:23.354 --> 30:25.219
Okay, let's say 6:00.

30:25.290 --> 30:28.020
I'll be the dashing New Yorker
with unlimited credit.

30:28.092 --> 30:30.026
It's a date.

30:30.094 --> 30:35.293
I mean, Thursday is the date of the day
when we'll meet.

30:35.366 --> 30:36.697
<i>I'll see you then.</i>

30:46.611 --> 30:48.806
You know you're crazy, right?

30:49.013 --> 30:50.275
Hmm.

30:50.348 --> 30:53.613
What if this guy turns out to be
from a bad family and kidnaps you

30:53.685 --> 30:57.781
and makes you clean their toilets and,
like, clean their dirty cats and all?

30:57.856 --> 31:01.121
Then he's in real trouble.
I'm not a good cleaner.

31:01.192 --> 31:03.524
<i>Bhaiya,</i> Mumbai Airport.
Thank you, <i>bhaiya.</i>

31:21.913 --> 31:23.437
Thanks, <i>bhaiya.</i>

31:30.255 --> 31:31.950
You know you're playing with matches.

31:32.023 --> 31:34.514
Fire? Why can't I have a little of that?

31:34.592 --> 31:38.255
Why can't I have
just one amazing last adventure

31:38.329 --> 31:40.797
before I come back to Vikram?
This is my bachelor party.

31:40.865 --> 31:42.628
I can't believe you're going all this way

31:42.700 --> 31:46.761
to see if this deranged guy is your Tom,
Richard, Harry, Hank soul mate guy.

31:46.838 --> 31:49.739
- I don't know.
- I promise you, I'll be back in two pieces.

31:49.807 --> 31:52.901
- You better.
- Wish the stars to shine bright on me.

31:57.181 --> 32:00.480
<i>Mummy, Papa, please don't faint,</i>

32:00.551 --> 32:04.647
<i>but by the time you hear this,</i>
<i>I'll be on my way to America.</i>

32:04.722 --> 32:08.385
<i>I know I should have told you,</i>
<i>but it was a last-minute decision.</i>

32:08.526 --> 32:13.828
<i>I left my heart</i>

32:17.001 --> 32:19.868
<i>In San Francisco</i>

32:26.210 --> 32:29.873
<i>I've decided to attend</i>
<i>father's cousin sister's birthday party</i>

32:29.948 --> 32:34.510
<i>in Palo Alto.</i>
<i>It's been a long time since I've seen them.</i>

32:34.585 --> 32:39.318
<i>I'll send everyone your regards.</i>
<i>And see you in five days, maybe.</i>

32:40.325 --> 32:41.587
Ouch!

32:42.527 --> 32:45.690
<i>And please don't panic,</i>
<i>I'm using my own savings.</i>

32:46.764 --> 32:51.030
<i>Papa, remember how you always wanted
your little daughter to travel</i>

32:51.102 --> 32:54.128
<i>and learn different cultures?</i>

32:54.205 --> 32:55.638
<i>This is your gift to me.</i>

32:55.974 --> 33:00.434
<i>The morning fog</i>

33:00.511 --> 33:04.948
<i>May chill the air</i>

33:06.818 --> 33:09.309
Hello. Welcome to Hawksin Hotel.

33:09.387 --> 33:11.116
- Have you got your passport on you?
- Yeah.

33:11.189 --> 33:14.249
Great. Thank you.

33:14.325 --> 33:16.623
You're the behind-the-scenes
creative guy.

33:16.694 --> 33:20.892
Yes, yes. No, and he knows why.

33:20.965 --> 33:22.660
Mr. Hawksin.

33:22.734 --> 33:24.998
Well, well.
Look who decided to get off their butts

33:25.069 --> 33:26.229
and come fight for the job.

33:26.304 --> 33:27.635
Never turn down a second chance.

33:27.705 --> 33:30.799
The rooms are fantastic, by the way.
Thank you, sir.

33:30.875 --> 33:33.571
- May I speak, sir?
- Only to say thank you.

33:33.644 --> 33:36.112
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

33:36.180 --> 33:39.206
- We're gonna knock your socks off.
- And then he ruins it by speaking again.

33:39.283 --> 33:41.979
Didn't we talk about that?
Didn't I ask you not to speak so much?

33:42.053 --> 33:44.613
Didn't I tell you to learn to listen?
Don't you want to be a nice boy?

33:44.689 --> 33:49.422
Didn't I tell you to be more like him?
Here, watch this. Your hair is on fire.

33:52.096 --> 33:55.156
But I don't want a Honda.
Learn from this.

33:59.437 --> 34:01.632
Could you shut up? He doesn't like you.

34:02.807 --> 34:04.172
He likes me.

34:11.215 --> 34:14.775
I can't believe you're hooking up
with the credit-card girl.

34:15.820 --> 34:20.052
No, wait, I believe it.
You're gutsy, pal.

34:20.391 --> 34:25.293
I mean, what if she turns out
to be this lonely housewife

34:25.797 --> 34:29.494
with four kids and bad teeth and gout?

34:29.567 --> 34:30.931
It's just drinks.

34:47.051 --> 34:48.518
Vibe?
- I got a good vibe.

34:48.585 --> 34:49.678
Oh!

34:50.521 --> 34:52.580
Just your type, 1 o'clock behind you.

34:52.657 --> 34:54.318
- This one?
- Yeah.

34:56.828 --> 34:58.193
Seriously.

35:01.532 --> 35:02.794
That's her.

35:04.335 --> 35:07.031
- I'm going in.
- Good luck.

35:20.918 --> 35:23.580
- Excuse me, Granger Woodruff.
- Hi.

35:24.489 --> 35:28.789
- You're not Jennifer David?
- No. But I wish I was.

35:30.828 --> 35:33.092
Sorry, I thought you were somebody else.

35:37.935 --> 35:41.098
Excuse me, ladies...

35:42.773 --> 35:45.606
You're not Jennifer David?

35:45.676 --> 35:48.372
- You didn't even talk to him?
<i>- I couldn't, Zia.</i>

35:48.613 --> 35:52.105
I was frozen, stuck, like gum.

35:52.216 --> 35:53.774
Okay, so your crazy crush is over.

35:53.851 --> 35:56.843
Just come home, we'll watch
<i>Fatal Attraction</i> and you'll be fine.

35:56.921 --> 35:58.081
Listen, this guy was no good.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.989
I'm sure he lied about those charges
and he spends money like a maniac.

36:01.058 --> 36:02.320
He's not a liar.

36:02.393 --> 36:05.590
And then he just, like, covers it all up.
It's just much better that you run now

36:05.663 --> 36:07.654
than be hot-glued to the floor later.

36:07.732 --> 36:09.393
Maybe I expected too much.

36:09.467 --> 36:11.992
<i>Besides, he didn't even</i>
<i>get a chance to meet me.</i>

36:12.069 --> 36:14.333
<i>If he did...</i>

36:14.405 --> 36:17.203
You know, there was something
magical in our talk, Zia.

36:17.275 --> 36:19.266
- I promise you.
<i>- Yes.</i>

36:19.343 --> 36:23.211
I do think that the American slang
for that is "bullshit."

36:23.814 --> 36:25.941
<i>- Just come home, okay?</i>
- Bye.

36:32.557 --> 36:34.684
So, your girl stood you up.

36:34.926 --> 36:37.656
Come out to dinner with me and Karen's
best friend, it'll be good for a laugh.

36:37.728 --> 36:40.288
Discussing the intimate details
of bridesmaids' dresses

36:40.364 --> 36:41.922
isn't my idea of a good time.

36:41.999 --> 36:46.299
But you, my friend, you've got to take
this stuff seriously. It's your wedding.

36:48.005 --> 36:50.405
Let me know how the bouquets work out.

36:53.911 --> 36:56.880
Sorry. You okay?

36:59.083 --> 37:02.712
- Gray...
- No, no, no, no. You... Do you see color?

37:03.187 --> 37:07.920
Look, red bag. Red...

37:13.431 --> 37:17.731
Keep the legs elevated.
I think you're gonna live.

37:18.536 --> 37:20.868
- I'm all right.
- I'm really sorry.

37:21.272 --> 37:24.332
- I didn't see you.
- No, I... I wasn't looking, I was...

37:24.408 --> 37:27.673
No, no, no. It's my fault. I feel awful.

37:29.280 --> 37:31.180
I wish you wouldn't...

37:32.416 --> 37:36.079
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, I mean...

37:36.787 --> 37:39.119
I wish you wouldn't feel awful.

37:42.426 --> 37:45.953
So, are you here on vacation?

37:47.632 --> 37:54.470
Yeah, from India. I'm visiting a relative
at Palo Alto, just for a party.

37:55.873 --> 37:58.239
Hey, I know this might sound odd,

37:58.309 --> 38:01.244
and considering the dangers
of being with me and all,

38:01.312 --> 38:03.473
but you hungry?

38:04.181 --> 38:08.242
I was gonna go out to dinner,
and I thought you might want to come.

38:09.620 --> 38:10.951
Oh! Um...

38:14.492 --> 38:19.828
That'll be nice, but only if it's ribs.

38:20.231 --> 38:24.998
I read about this place in my guidebook.
You do like meat, don't you?

38:27.305 --> 38:28.294
Yeah.

38:30.207 --> 38:31.606
Mmm.

38:31.942 --> 38:35.002
They're delicious, thank you.

38:35.513 --> 38:38.311
Granger Woodruff, by the way.

38:39.750 --> 38:41.877
Hello, Granger, I'm Priya Sethi.

38:42.753 --> 38:45.483
Okay, Priya. You've got to just dig in.

38:45.890 --> 38:47.824
Okay? Don't...
Don't worry about getting messy.

38:47.892 --> 38:50.326
Just get it all over you.

38:50.394 --> 38:51.622
Okay.

38:53.397 --> 38:55.729
So, what do you do in Mumbai?

38:58.269 --> 39:00.965
- I'm a nurse. Yeah.
- Nurse.

39:01.372 --> 39:03.135
It's quite nice.

39:04.809 --> 39:06.504
- Good food.
- So...

39:07.311 --> 39:10.007
- Is this your first trip to America?
- Yeah.

39:10.081 --> 39:14.381
I always wanted to come,
and it's much more than I've expected.

39:15.653 --> 39:18.281
- You're on vacation?
- I wish.

39:19.323 --> 39:23.692
I'm actually here for a business campaign.
I have this huge presentation next week.

39:23.861 --> 39:27.957
Hey, maybe you can help me.
I mean, you're international clientele.

39:28.866 --> 39:31.266
What attracted you to the Hawksin Hotel?

39:34.004 --> 39:37.667
- A friend told me about it.
- So you go on personal recommendations?

39:37.875 --> 39:40.935
I mean, do you ever just
want to take a chance?

39:41.445 --> 39:45.347
You know, like... Like the feeling
of trying something different?

39:45.416 --> 39:49.716
I take chances, but usually
I can never afford them.

39:49.787 --> 39:53.655
Charge it, you know, charge everything.
Just pay for it later.

39:54.625 --> 39:57.253
Just don't let it get stolen.

39:58.028 --> 40:00.019
Did someone steal your card?

40:00.131 --> 40:03.032
I have my ace credit-card girl
working on it.

40:03.100 --> 40:07.059
She was actually supposed to meet me,
but she blew me off.

40:07.438 --> 40:11.272
Yeah. When someone opts out
of a prearranged appointment.

40:13.844 --> 40:17.041
- For what purpose were you to meet her?
- Just casual.

40:17.148 --> 40:18.979
She sounded nice.

40:19.517 --> 40:22.645
But her friends probably warned her
about meeting a complete stranger,

40:22.720 --> 40:24.881
and she probably thought I was psychotic,

40:24.955 --> 40:27.981
or maybe she just took
one look at me and ran.

40:30.861 --> 40:33.728
Excuse me, I...
I need to go to the restroom.

40:36.066 --> 40:40.526
Zia, it's me. Could you please connect me
to Granger? It's 4593330555.

40:40.604 --> 40:43.835
Why do you want to talk to him?
I thought you blew him out.

40:43.908 --> 40:48.777
I don't want him to think I was rude, and
actually, we're having dinner right now.

40:49.346 --> 40:53.373
- What? You told him you're Jennifer?
<i>- No. It... It doesn't matter.</i>

40:53.551 --> 40:55.815
<i>We're meeting as our real selves,</i>
<i>and it's better this way.</i>

40:55.886 --> 40:58.252
<i>So, could you please</i>
<i>connect me to Granger?</i>

40:58.322 --> 41:00.051
Priya, this can lead to no good.

41:00.124 --> 41:05.061
Or it could lead to the perfect romantic
moment under the Golden Gate Bridge.

41:05.629 --> 41:08.154
Listen, honestly, you've lost your head.

41:11.268 --> 41:12.428
Hello?

41:12.503 --> 41:14.596
Hello, Granger. It's Jennifer David.

41:14.672 --> 41:17.402
Hey! Is everything okay?

41:18.075 --> 41:20.908
I'm afraid when you didn't show up,
I signed up with the Visa girl.

41:20.978 --> 41:22.707
<i>She threw in a hat.</i>

41:23.447 --> 41:26.416
I wanted to apologize
about not making our appointment.

41:26.484 --> 41:29.419
It turns out I'm out of town, after all.

41:29.487 --> 41:32.149
That's cool. Maybe next time, then.

41:32.623 --> 41:36.150
Very good. It...
It sounds like you're at a restaurant.

41:36.227 --> 41:40.664
<i>- Teddy's Barbecue. You been?</i>
- Yeah. I was there recently.

41:40.731 --> 41:44.997
Excellent ribs.
It's very romantic, isn't it?

41:47.071 --> 41:52.566
Yeah. You know, since you stood me up,
I'm actually here with a nice girl.

41:53.210 --> 41:55.269
Of course, I did smack her in the head,

41:55.346 --> 41:57.644
which I wouldn't have done
if you did show up.

41:57.715 --> 42:01.151
Well, have fun with your friend.
I'm sure she's quite lovely.

42:01.785 --> 42:07.951
Inside and out. Not to be conceited for her.
Enjoy your evening.

42:08.359 --> 42:11.419
- Good night.
- Good night.

42:26.744 --> 42:29.235
Oh, wow, she's so good.

42:32.416 --> 42:37.046
- Hello?
- Hello, sister. How're things there?

42:37.821 --> 42:39.914
<i>- Ji,</i> ask.
- Okay.

42:40.491 --> 42:41.753
What I wanted to know, sister...

42:41.825 --> 42:43.816
Anji, just switch it off,
I can't hear a word.

42:45.095 --> 42:47.393
Has finally Priya arrived there?

42:48.065 --> 42:50.966
Priya? No. Priya isn't here.

42:51.235 --> 42:52.429
Priya is not there?

42:53.737 --> 42:57.264
One minute. One minute. Supposing...
Supposing she wants to give a surprise?

42:57.341 --> 42:59.901
- Hang up. Hang up.
- Wait a minute, sister. What?

42:59.977 --> 43:01.911
- Hang up the phone.
- She might want to give a surprise.

43:01.979 --> 43:03.571
- Hang up. Hang up.
- I just can't hang up just like that.

43:03.647 --> 43:04.636
- Quiet!
- Hang up.

43:05.783 --> 43:07.148
<i>Haan,</i> sister. In case Priya...

43:08.285 --> 43:09.980
In case Priya calls up,

43:10.054 --> 43:12.249
just tell her that...
Just inform us, okay?

43:12.323 --> 43:15.918
Stop it, <i>ji,</i> stop it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hello, phone...

43:15.993 --> 43:18.052
He sounded very confused.

43:27.538 --> 43:30.837
- Woodruff. Well...
- Mr. Hawksin.

43:33.077 --> 43:35.307
I'd like you to meet my wife, Haejin.

43:35.613 --> 43:37.171
- Hello.
- Hi. Granger.

43:37.615 --> 43:42.575
I'd like to introduce you to a very good
friend of mine, Priya Sethi.

43:42.953 --> 43:43.977
She's from Mumbai.

43:44.054 --> 43:46.318
Mumbai.
That's the New York of India, right?

43:46.390 --> 43:48.551
I hear there's quite an explosion
of jobs there.

43:48.626 --> 43:51.925
I like to think of New York
as the Mumbai of America,

43:51.996 --> 43:53.964
both with talented human resources.

43:58.202 --> 44:01.501
- That's so sweet.
- Very impressive.

44:01.872 --> 44:04.238
Well, we opened a hotel in Mumbai in '98,

44:04.308 --> 44:06.776
the Hawksin Standard at Nariman Point.
Do you know it?

44:06.844 --> 44:10.610
It's beautiful. The use of
steel and glass is breathtaking.

44:10.714 --> 44:14.241
Thank you. We think so, too.
You're lovely. Isn't she?

44:14.618 --> 44:17.109
- She's lovely.
- Yes, she is.

44:17.421 --> 44:20.618
Has he invited you to our little shindig?

44:20.691 --> 44:23.922
- I was just about to, actually.
- Good, good. Hold on a second.

44:23.994 --> 44:26.827
Mary Pat, this young lady has come
a very long way to be with us.

44:26.897 --> 44:29.764
Would you give her our nicest room,
with fruit basket, extra chocolates,

44:29.833 --> 44:31.357
flowers every day? On my account.

44:31.435 --> 44:33.960
Very good, Mr. Hawksin.
- That's very generous, sir.

44:34.038 --> 44:35.437
Don't be silly.

44:35.606 --> 44:40.407
So, we'll move you to 1740. It's a nicer
floor with its own concierge service,

44:40.477 --> 44:44.208
and I'll put you under Mr. Hawksin's name
as his guest.

44:44.281 --> 44:46.340
Thank you. That's very kind of you.

44:46.417 --> 44:49.784
Not at all. One of the pleasures
of owning places like this,

44:49.853 --> 44:52.378
doing nice things for nice people.

44:55.292 --> 44:57.317
If you'll excuse us,
we'll say our good nights.

44:57.394 --> 44:58.656
Good night.

44:58.829 --> 45:00.797
- Good night.
- Good night.

45:06.370 --> 45:08.804
Wow! I... You...

45:09.173 --> 45:12.973
You know, he really...
I've never seen him act like that before.

45:13.043 --> 45:16.012
- Yeah?
- That was amazing.

45:16.246 --> 45:17.907
No, no.
Let me just get one thing right.

45:17.981 --> 45:19.972
Aren't you supposed to be
Priya's best friend?

45:20.050 --> 45:21.312
Yes, Mr. Sethi.

45:21.385 --> 45:23.546
- Isn't she supposed to tell you everything?
- Yes.

45:23.620 --> 45:25.053
Then why aren't you telling me
where she is?

45:25.122 --> 45:26.885
Okay, maybe I should ask Miss Prasad.
Miss Prasad!

45:26.957 --> 45:28.857
No, no, no. Mr. Sethi, please.

45:29.693 --> 45:30.887
- I'll tell you.
- What?

45:30.961 --> 45:33.794
- She's gone to meet a CITYone customer.
- Okay. Where?

45:33.864 --> 45:37.231
- Mr. Granger Woodruff.
- Okay. An American?

45:38.168 --> 45:40.136
- To America? Oh, my God!
- Oh, God. No...

45:40.204 --> 45:41.899
- I should have never let her work here.
- No.

45:41.972 --> 45:45.567
No, no, no! Mr. Sethi.
I promise you, she's coming back.

45:45.642 --> 45:48.577
She had no intention to elope,
or anything of that nature.

45:48.645 --> 45:51.546
- Elope? Who is talking about elope?
- Oh, God.

45:51.615 --> 45:53.708
Oh, my God. I have to go.
I have to go and get her.

45:53.784 --> 45:56.344
- I have...
- No, no, no, Mr. Sethi! No, no!

45:56.420 --> 45:58.615
Mr. Sethi, I promise you,
she's coming back.

46:25.182 --> 46:27.412
Morning, Priya.

46:27.851 --> 46:31.480
Hey! Isn't it amazing?

46:32.990 --> 46:36.448
- I love rain.
- Yeah, yeah. It's... It's great.

46:37.461 --> 46:40.123
Hey, you're still going to meet me at
the restaurant tonight at 7:00, right?

46:40.197 --> 46:45.134
Yeah.
Hey, is this a fancy party or something?

46:45.769 --> 46:47.964
Well, you might want to wear
something nice.

46:48.038 --> 46:51.530
I mean, not nice-nice. But, you know.

46:52.075 --> 46:53.303
Yeah.

46:56.680 --> 47:01.117
Well, I have some work to do,
but I'll see you tonight.

47:01.919 --> 47:03.113
Great.

47:10.093 --> 47:12.561
<i>Welcome to San Francisco International.</i>

47:12.663 --> 47:14.221
Now, the moment we find our luggage,

47:14.298 --> 47:17.062
- we'll go and find this Hawksin hotel.
- Careful, careful.

47:19.102 --> 47:22.162
- Rajiv Uncle!
- Who's this man talking to me like this?

47:22.339 --> 47:25.172
- I'm Sajarit from Punjab.
- Okay, how...

47:25.242 --> 47:28.109
I know it has been a little while
since Navinda's wedding, but...

47:28.178 --> 47:30.806
Your family owns that store in Hoboken.

47:30.881 --> 47:32.041
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:32.115 --> 47:34.447
- And she's my wife, Neha.
- Hello, <i>namaste.</i>

47:34.518 --> 47:36.679
And you are here
for Rani Auntie's birthday.

47:36.753 --> 47:38.778
Of course, of course,
and we are getting late

47:38.856 --> 47:40.847
and we have to find a cab
and get our luggage first.

47:40.924 --> 47:42.448
Come, come, come.
I'll give you a ride in my car.

47:42.526 --> 47:44.426
No, no, no! We don't want a ride!

47:44.494 --> 47:46.485
My parents will be furious
if I did not give a ride.

47:46.563 --> 47:49.430
- Please, come with me. My car is quite big.
- No, no, no... It's fine, thank you.

47:49.499 --> 47:50.989
My car is fast. Neha, please hold this.

47:51.068 --> 47:52.365
- Okay.
- Come, come. Come, come, come.

47:52.436 --> 47:54.529
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, I'll help you.
- It's fine! It's fine...

47:54.605 --> 47:57.267
It's so good to see you.
Come, please, excuse me.

47:57.341 --> 48:01.038
And this is a most pleasant
surprise for us. Please accept tea.

48:01.111 --> 48:03.409
We thought, since you were coming
all the way from here

48:03.480 --> 48:06.574
to Mumbai for Priya's wedding,

48:06.650 --> 48:11.246
we thought it was important that we also
show our respects, by coming to...

48:11.321 --> 48:15.849
<i>Han ji.</i> You know, but we are only sorry
that Priya and Govinda couldn't come.

48:15.959 --> 48:19.656
- Priya is visiting friends.
- Friends.

48:20.631 --> 48:24.931
And Govinda, you know, so
busy with exams and cricket and all that.

48:25.002 --> 48:26.970
- His final exam's going on.
<i>- Han ji. Han ji.</i>

48:46.990 --> 48:50.426
Hi, sorry to disturb you.
Delivery for Priya Sethi.

48:50.494 --> 48:53.486
- Really? Thank you.
- Here you go.

49:06.276 --> 49:08.642
Anji, where is your boom box?

49:09.713 --> 49:11.681
- She's asleep.
- Okay.

49:13.216 --> 49:18.313
All right, we will find this Hotel Hawkskin
as quickly as possible.

49:18.388 --> 49:21.186
- Yeah.
- There, we will divide,

49:21.591 --> 49:23.684
locate Priya and take her home.

49:24.227 --> 49:27.094
Pimmi, you will stay here.
If there's a problem, we'll call you.

49:27.164 --> 49:29.860
- No, no, no, no. I'm coming with you.
- Let her come, <i>ji.</i>

49:29.933 --> 49:31.798
- Okay. Huh?
- Rajiv? Where is he?

49:31.868 --> 49:33.768
- Hello.
- Hello.

49:33.837 --> 49:36.670
Oh, there you are.
Rajiv, please come down.

49:36.773 --> 49:40.800
Anji wants to show her dance. She's been
practicing specially for Rani Auntie.

49:40.877 --> 49:44.643
But, <i>Auntie ji's</i> sleeping.
I don't think it's nice to disturb her.

49:44.715 --> 49:48.583
Let her sleep. She sleeps through
everything. You, come down. Come.

49:48.652 --> 49:50.950
- Now?
- Oh, yeah. Why not?

49:51.621 --> 49:53.384
- Right now?
- Oh, yeah. Right now.

49:53.457 --> 49:57.052
Come on, she's all set with her music
in her hand. Please, Rajiv.

49:58.695 --> 50:00.595
Come on, Anji. Play some music. Come on.

50:03.066 --> 50:04.727
Shake it, Anji!

50:06.136 --> 50:08.434
Isn't she wonderful, Rajiv?

50:11.208 --> 50:12.800
Come on, do it!

50:14.811 --> 50:18.372
Oh, I forgot. The Sawants are coming over
for dinner tonight.

50:38.602 --> 50:42.197
<i>Some day</i>

50:42.873 --> 50:46.536
<i>When I'm awfully low</i>

50:47.344 --> 50:51.280
<i>When the world is cold</i>

50:51.948 --> 50:54.610
<i>I will feel a glow</i>

50:54.684 --> 50:59.951
<i>Just thinking of you</i>

51:00.824 --> 51:07.423
<i>And the way you look tonight</i>

51:15.806 --> 51:17.239
<i>Lovely</i>

51:17.340 --> 51:18.739
Who's that?

51:20.343 --> 51:21.867
Just a friend.

51:22.579 --> 51:24.740
First impressions can be deceiving.

51:24.815 --> 51:27.113
- The thing about this guy...
- Here we go.

51:27.184 --> 51:30.551
...he's all casual charm
like nothing gets to him,

51:30.620 --> 51:32.986
but really, complete softie.

51:33.056 --> 51:34.614
- Yeah?
- In college,

51:34.691 --> 51:38.889
he couldn't eat or sleep until this
girl he liked finally talked to him.

51:38.962 --> 51:41.522
- I think he actually threw up afterwards.
- What?

51:41.598 --> 51:43.395
The man knows
how to make an impression.

51:43.467 --> 51:45.435
Wait, let me give you a little advice.

51:45.502 --> 51:47.094
Don't listen to drunk Americans.

51:47.170 --> 51:49.138
No, but I do agree with Charlie.

51:49.206 --> 51:52.198
You know, there's something more
than what you really show.

51:52.275 --> 51:54.436
What about you? Any secrets?

51:54.511 --> 51:58.345
Are you an Indian movie star
hiding in America as a tourist?

51:59.249 --> 52:01.774
Well, glad you could make it.
Enjoying yourselves, I hope?

52:01.852 --> 52:03.683
- Definitely. Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

52:04.554 --> 52:06.044
It's a wonderful party.

52:06.123 --> 52:08.489
Same feeling as the rest of your hotels,

52:08.558 --> 52:11.425
a magical oasis
that springs from nowhere.

52:11.495 --> 52:13.588
It's so familiar.

52:13.663 --> 52:15.062
We need you now.

52:15.132 --> 52:16.724
Maybe I should hire her
for my ad campaign.

52:18.168 --> 52:19.635
She's a smart girl.

52:21.171 --> 52:23.366
- He's kidding, right?
- Yeah, he's kidding.

52:24.975 --> 52:26.602
Have fun, buddy.

52:27.777 --> 52:28.766
It's okay.

52:30.647 --> 52:33.616
Look, but don't touch.
Look, but don't touch.

52:34.017 --> 52:35.985
Do you know, when I was little,

52:36.052 --> 52:39.852
I always wanted to find the golden ticket
in that chocolate,

52:39.923 --> 52:42.187
like Willy Wonka,

52:43.793 --> 52:46.421
so that I could go somewhere new.

52:47.631 --> 52:49.758
I always wanted to know
who was gonna drink that chocolate

52:49.833 --> 52:52.393
- after the fat kid fell in it.
- Yeah.

52:54.204 --> 52:56.695
Did you just try to push me in?

52:56.773 --> 52:58.866
That was a tap and you're too heavy.

52:58.942 --> 53:01.172
You see,
I knew there was another side to you.

53:01.244 --> 53:05.112
On the outside, you're the psychic,
sweet nurse from India,

53:06.283 --> 53:08.080
but you've got a streak.

53:11.555 --> 53:14.820
You're right.
There are things you should know.

53:19.462 --> 53:21.327
- Talk. Talk.
- Are you mad?

53:21.398 --> 53:23.229
- No.
- Talk.

53:23.300 --> 53:24.961
I'll throw you in.

53:26.803 --> 53:29.101
I forgot to watch out
for drunk Americans.

53:31.341 --> 53:32.433
Oh, there you are.

53:32.509 --> 53:34.340
Listen, I know, I know,
I'm sorry to interrupt.

53:34.411 --> 53:36.208
Business first, I need you for a second.

53:36.279 --> 53:38.008
One of us will be right back.

53:46.022 --> 53:48.047
- Gee.
- What's up, buddy?

53:48.959 --> 53:52.451
- I just put something together.
- Oh, yeah? What's that?

53:53.230 --> 53:55.289
Well, call me cynical,

53:56.099 --> 53:58.863
but did you bring your Indian friend
Prius here...

53:58.935 --> 54:00.800
- Priya.
- Whatever.

54:00.870 --> 54:04.772
To show Hawksin you're some
free-thinking, international guy?

54:04.841 --> 54:07.332
"Look at me, I'm dating an Indian girl."

54:07.410 --> 54:10.004
Yeah, you...
You figured me out, Chuck.

54:10.080 --> 54:11.980
Oh, yeah.

54:14.484 --> 54:16.076
All right, all right.

54:21.291 --> 54:23.384
Priya! Priya, wait!

54:27.264 --> 54:29.562
- Where are you going?
- I'm going back.

54:30.834 --> 54:32.495
I think I've served my purpose.

54:33.603 --> 54:36.970
- What are you talking about?
- I hope I was impressive enough for him.

54:38.008 --> 54:38.997
I heard you.

54:39.075 --> 54:42.511
You only took me to the party
to make your boss happy.

54:43.079 --> 54:45.070
Is that why you bought me this dress?

54:45.882 --> 54:48.715
- So I wouldn't embarrass you?
- What?

54:48.785 --> 54:50.446
No, no.

54:55.025 --> 54:57.789
Okay, look, the thought did cross my mind

54:57.861 --> 55:00.352
that bringing you to this party
would impress Kit.

55:00.430 --> 55:03.399
- But the truth is, I think you're...
- Stupid.

55:04.567 --> 55:05.761
Right?

55:21.384 --> 55:23.852
Get into the car.
Both of you, get into the car.

55:23.920 --> 55:26.548
Rajiv! Rajiv, where are you off to?

55:26.656 --> 55:29.352
Priya called and asked us
to pick her up from the city.

55:29.426 --> 55:31.587
We didn't want to
inconvenience you, so...

55:31.661 --> 55:33.993
I'll also come with you, since you don't
know your way around here.

55:34.064 --> 55:36.498
No, no, we've got the map.
Show her the map.

55:36.566 --> 55:40.195
You've been already too generous, okay?
We'll return the car soon. Bye!

55:40.270 --> 55:41.294
- Bye!
- Bye!

55:56.019 --> 55:57.350
Who is it?

56:14.904 --> 56:17.270
I don't have time
to eat your poisoned candy.

56:17.340 --> 56:18.773
It's just a little poison.

56:19.609 --> 56:21.634
Come on! Just one bite.

56:22.912 --> 56:24.504
Did you read it?

56:25.248 --> 56:26.806
No, I threw it away.

56:29.886 --> 56:32.150
I heard your little fingers
peel back the wrapper.

56:32.222 --> 56:36.488
Though, as I've witnessed,
your ears are far superior to mine.

56:45.268 --> 56:47.634
It's American for "I'm sorry."

56:47.704 --> 56:49.729
Did you steal it from the hotel lobby?

56:49.806 --> 56:51.637
That is an outrageous accusation.

56:52.475 --> 56:54.409
Okay, yeah, I did.

57:04.421 --> 57:08.084
Okay, everything except the last thing.

57:12.028 --> 57:14.326
You're right. I'm sorry.

57:20.136 --> 57:23.435
At least let me give you a day
you'll never forget?

57:31.648 --> 57:34.048
All right, I promised you a day
you're never gonna forget,

57:34.117 --> 57:36.278
- and that's what you're gonna get.
- And your presentation?

57:36.352 --> 57:37.546
I'm procrastinating.

57:37.620 --> 57:40.612
Actually, I was hoping
you'd be my inspiration.

57:40.690 --> 57:41.987
Wow!

57:42.058 --> 57:44.151
Now, anything catches your eye,
just take a picture.

57:44.227 --> 57:45.319
Okay.

57:46.496 --> 57:49.932
<i>Pretty woman, walking down the street</i>

57:49.999 --> 57:53.730
<i>Pretty woman, the kind I like to meet</i>

57:53.803 --> 57:56.135
<i>Pretty woman</i>

57:56.339 --> 57:59.706
<i>I don't believe you, you're not the truth</i>

58:00.143 --> 58:03.670
<i>No one could look as good as you</i>

58:06.483 --> 58:07.814
<i>Mercy</i>

58:11.721 --> 58:13.518
<i>Pretty woman...</i>

58:13.590 --> 58:14.614
I don't know.

58:14.691 --> 58:17.387
Like hold the crab,
you need to get over your crab fear.

58:17.460 --> 58:18.552
Nibbling.

58:19.295 --> 58:21.661
<i>Pretty woman</i>

58:21.731 --> 58:25.827
<i>That you look lovely as can be</i>

58:25.902 --> 58:31.101
<i>Are you lonely just like me?</i>

58:31.975 --> 58:35.775
<i>Oh, oh, pretty woman</i>

58:39.482 --> 58:42.679
So, in India do your parents pick out
who you're gonna marry?

58:44.153 --> 58:45.586
Look at that.

58:46.422 --> 58:48.322
Yeah, in a way.

58:49.526 --> 58:52.188
Well, probably cuts down
on a lot of bad dates.

58:52.262 --> 58:54.196
- And a lot of good ones.
- That's true.

58:56.266 --> 58:58.393
But, you know,

58:58.468 --> 59:00.698
people learn that love grows.

59:01.471 --> 59:05.134
It's not like a rose
already blooming in a flower shop.

59:05.208 --> 59:07.403
Well, what if you get
one of those plants that,

59:07.477 --> 59:11.777
you know, you take home,
and after like two days, it just dies?

59:11.848 --> 59:13.782
Better luck next life.

59:16.553 --> 59:17.952
Look at you.

59:19.188 --> 59:21.088
Probably find Priya under Granger.

59:22.926 --> 59:27.386
I mean, you know, the chances of you
finding your name are basically

59:27.463 --> 59:29.931
the same as finding mine...
I'm gonna shut up now.

59:33.570 --> 59:35.629
- So, Mr. Cook...
- Yeah.

59:35.705 --> 59:38.367
What about dinner somewhere different?

59:40.743 --> 59:42.370
- I'm game.
- Yeah?

59:43.680 --> 59:44.669
Better.

59:49.953 --> 59:51.045
This is great.

59:54.424 --> 59:55.652
Thank you.

59:56.893 --> 59:59.384
I should tell you that

59:59.462 --> 01:00:02.363
- I've never had Indian before.
- I know.

01:00:03.733 --> 01:00:06.395
But I'm glad
you're trying out something new.

01:00:06.469 --> 01:00:11.497
So just dig in, don't even think about it.
You might just love it.

01:00:19.582 --> 01:00:21.607
- Not bad.
- See?

01:00:24.821 --> 01:00:28.518
You know, if you ever
wanna impress an Indian family,

01:00:28.591 --> 01:00:31.526
you should tell about the things
you really love.

01:00:31.594 --> 01:00:35.086
You know, family, education,

01:00:36.432 --> 01:00:41.131
food, marriage, you know,
stuff like that.

01:00:42.171 --> 01:00:45.732
So, your parents putting pressure on you
to get married?

01:00:48.511 --> 01:00:50.775
I'll marry someday, you know.

01:00:55.718 --> 01:00:56.742
Mmm.

01:00:56.819 --> 01:00:59.947
- Let me try.
- No, leave that!

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:07.588
It's really spicy.

01:01:15.338 --> 01:01:16.828
It's very spicy.

01:01:18.474 --> 01:01:19.907
- Some more?
- No.

01:01:19.976 --> 01:01:21.341
Mmm-hmm. Mmm...

01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:22.605
I'm fine.

01:01:25.815 --> 01:01:28.306
- Has your tongue cooled down?
- What tongue?

01:01:29.619 --> 01:01:31.985
How will you make your little jokes now?

01:01:32.055 --> 01:01:33.113
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:01:33.189 --> 01:01:34.816
Are you being sassy?

01:01:34.891 --> 01:01:38.224
You've been here, what, three days,
and you've already picked up sass?

01:01:38.294 --> 01:01:41.525
Couldn't you just take home a magnet
or a T-shirt?

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:50.071
- I always wanted to swim in the ocean.
- What? No, no, no.

01:01:50.473 --> 01:01:54.273
You go for it,
but I have to warn you, it's...

01:01:56.746 --> 01:01:59.772
- It's kind of cold.
- It is not!

01:02:04.754 --> 01:02:06.779
Easy.

01:02:06.856 --> 01:02:08.323
- Okay, come on.
- No, no. I'm not going.

01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:09.881
- Are you scared?
- Yeah, I'm scared.

01:02:09.959 --> 01:02:11.119
- You are?
- There's sharks in there.

01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:13.321
Oh, yeah? I'm a shark then.

01:02:15.932 --> 01:02:18.901
<i>It's all I wanna do</i>

01:02:20.603 --> 01:02:24.334
<i>Give you the strength to hold on</i>

01:02:25.441 --> 01:02:28.274
<i>When we are apart</i>

01:02:28.344 --> 01:02:31.745
<i>I give to you my heart</i>

01:02:36.152 --> 01:02:38.450
I've had a really great night.

01:02:38.721 --> 01:02:40.154
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:02:40.623 --> 01:02:45.219
<i>Because of who you are</i>

01:02:48.297 --> 01:02:50.697
<i>You're beautiful</i>

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:57.639
<i>You're beautiful to me</i>

01:02:57.707 --> 01:02:59.470
<i>Yeah</i>

01:03:00.476 --> 01:03:03.502
<i>You're beautiful</i>

01:03:03.579 --> 01:03:07.948
<i>You're beautiful to me</i>

01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:14.078
If you could live your life any way,
what would you want?

01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:16.089
Like any way.

01:03:16.425 --> 01:03:17.687
What would I want?

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:18.988
Mmm-hmm.

01:03:20.363 --> 01:03:23.992
You mean besides a dance by the water
with a beautiful woman?

01:03:28.771 --> 01:03:30.102
All right.

01:03:31.374 --> 01:03:32.807
You still have to answer my question.

01:03:32.875 --> 01:03:36.208
I was hoping I could charm my way
out of answering.

01:03:36.612 --> 01:03:38.512
Okay, give me a second.

01:03:42.084 --> 01:03:45.747
I guess I don't wanna die a failure.

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:47.483
What do you mean?

01:03:48.524 --> 01:03:51.220
That I didn't try hard enough
or something.

01:03:51.294 --> 01:03:55.162
Like with my job. You know,
I want to be the best at what I do.

01:03:55.932 --> 01:03:59.561
The scary part is putting yourself
and your ideas out there.

01:03:59.635 --> 01:04:01.762
What if you crash and burn?

01:04:02.805 --> 01:04:04.466
Isn't it worth it?

01:04:07.443 --> 01:04:11.971
Deep down I guess I'm afraid
it won't work out.

01:04:16.018 --> 01:04:19.181
What about you?
Did you always want to be a nurse?

01:04:20.623 --> 01:04:23.751
No. I...

01:04:29.298 --> 01:04:33.257
I guess I want to do things
that make people happy.

01:04:39.008 --> 01:04:42.569
Well, maybe you should do something
that makes you happy.

01:04:57.593 --> 01:04:59.618
Turn left, turn left.
Left, left, left, left.

01:04:59.695 --> 01:05:02.755
Right! Right! Right, right.
- Right, right.

01:05:02.999 --> 01:05:06.230
No, I don't think so.
- Bye, girls.

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:10.365
All you told me to get into this right
and now we're stuck in one-way street.

01:05:10.506 --> 01:05:13.031
<i>Ji,</i> you were driving straight
on that crooked street.

01:05:13.709 --> 01:05:17.577
<i>Achha,</i> listen. Why don't we ask
one of these nice gentlemen to help us?

01:05:17.647 --> 01:05:18.875
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Can you help us please?

01:05:18.948 --> 01:05:22.907
Excuse me. Could you please tell me
where is this Hawksin Hotel?

01:05:23.052 --> 01:05:25.077
- Hi, handsome.
- Okay, handsome.

01:05:25.154 --> 01:05:27.952
Can I interest you in some group sex?

01:05:28.024 --> 01:05:30.618
What?
- No, no, no, no. Don't, don't...

01:05:30.693 --> 01:05:32.024
Hawksin Street, where is that?

01:05:32.094 --> 01:05:35.393
Excuse me, we just wanted to know
where is the... No, no, no, no.

01:05:35.464 --> 01:05:37.523
We don't like that. No, no.

01:05:39.035 --> 01:05:41.003
Come on, let's go party.

01:05:42.204 --> 01:05:44.001
- Driving. Driving.
- Let's go!

01:05:56.452 --> 01:05:59.444
Excuse me.
I was wondering if you've seen a girl,

01:05:59.522 --> 01:06:02.013
age 23, height is... How much?

01:06:02.091 --> 01:06:03.649
- Very pretty.
- Very pretty.

01:06:03.726 --> 01:06:06.889
And she was seen here in your hotel
with a gentleman,

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:09.955
and I think the meeting
was quite explicit.

01:06:10.032 --> 01:06:12.626
I'm sorry, sir, but I can't comment
on the activities of any of our guests.

01:06:12.702 --> 01:06:14.932
Excuse me. Did you say you were looking
for a young Indian girl?

01:06:15.004 --> 01:06:16.631
Yes! Yes, yes, yes.

01:06:16.706 --> 01:06:19.300
I think I know the girl. I should,
I gave her a hotel room last night.

01:06:20.543 --> 01:06:23.103
Pretty girl.
No, I'm saying good-looking kid.

01:06:23.179 --> 01:06:24.237
Oh, my God!

01:06:24.313 --> 01:06:25.974
Wait a minute.
Is this about me paying for it?

01:06:26.048 --> 01:06:28.107
'Cause I'll be honest with you,
I do it all the time.

01:06:28.184 --> 01:06:30.243
You are the one who has
kidnapped my daughter!

01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:32.514
Hey, kidnapped? Take it easy.
Buddy, she wanted it.

01:06:32.588 --> 01:06:34.215
- She liked it.
- Yeah.

01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:35.484
Is she with you?

01:06:35.558 --> 01:06:37.992
No, no, no. I was with her last night.

01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:41.291
Tonight she's probably with a guy I know.
Maybe two, he's got a partner.

01:06:41.364 --> 01:06:43.264
- Where is my daughter?
- Hey, hey!

01:06:43.332 --> 01:06:45.357
Where's my daughter?
- You wanna call somebody?

01:06:45.434 --> 01:06:47.061
- Leave me!
- No, <i>ji!</i>

01:06:48.337 --> 01:06:49.326
No!

01:06:49.405 --> 01:06:51.168
This is outrageous!

01:07:06.989 --> 01:07:12.791
Well, thank you for a very memorable
and very wet evening.

01:07:13.929 --> 01:07:16.227
- I had fun today.
- Me, too.

01:07:18.734 --> 01:07:20.065
Good night.

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:24.462
Unless, you know, you want to

01:07:28.344 --> 01:07:29.834
grab a drink.

01:07:30.112 --> 01:07:32.774
Do you know they charge $8 for a cola?

01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:39.184
Oh, uh...

01:07:43.859 --> 01:07:46.623
I need to get out of these wet clothes.

01:07:48.631 --> 01:07:49.962
In my room.

01:07:51.467 --> 01:07:52.798
With me.

01:08:04.313 --> 01:08:05.712
Good night.

01:08:06.015 --> 01:08:07.209
Night.

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:14.978
<i>Zia, I called you at work today,</i>
<i>but you were not there.</i>

01:08:15.891 --> 01:08:19.827
I just want to let you know
that I think I am in love.

01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:23.627
And I don't wanna marry Vikram.

01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:27.961
Something could happen with Granger.

01:08:29.205 --> 01:08:34.438
I have to go to my cousin's party today,
but then I will tell him about Vikram.

01:08:36.345 --> 01:08:40.281
So, what's going on
with you two, anyway?

01:08:41.183 --> 01:08:42.411
Nothing.

01:08:43.853 --> 01:08:46.185
She's going back to India on Monday.

01:08:46.255 --> 01:08:50.157
- And, what, you go back to Emory?
- I don't know.

01:08:50.225 --> 01:08:54.492
You know,
Emory, she looks good on paper.

01:08:54.563 --> 01:08:57.760
I just never really felt it with Emory,
you know?

01:08:59.201 --> 01:09:00.225
No.

01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:09.174
Thanks for driving me.

01:09:10.345 --> 01:09:15.305
Well, Palo Alto is pretty far. I don't
know how else you were gonna get there.

01:09:15.384 --> 01:09:16.975
No, I wanted to.

01:09:20.022 --> 01:09:23.321
So, do you have to leave tomorrow?

01:09:26.495 --> 01:09:31.990
I mean, I know we just met
and this probably sounds crazy,

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:36.299
but maybe you could stay longer.

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:39.808
You know, I just got my presentation
but after that...

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:44.736
For how long do you want me to stay?

01:09:45.915 --> 01:09:48.907
I don't know.
I didn't really think about it.

01:09:50.752 --> 01:09:51.879
Uh...

01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:56.014
- This is the exit.
- Okay.

01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:58.752
So...

01:10:01.597 --> 01:10:03.724
Which way do you wanna go?

01:10:03.799 --> 01:10:05.266
I don't know.

01:10:05.801 --> 01:10:10.170
Okay, well, you've got a 50-50 shot.
Right or left?

01:10:11.707 --> 01:10:17.145
I'm sorry. Right.
No, I mean, go left. Left.

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:18.646
Left it is.

01:10:25.421 --> 01:10:27.981
- Granger...
- Yeah?

01:10:35.764 --> 01:10:39.359
- It's the second house on the right.
- Oh, okay.

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:52.279
I would invite you inside,
but I have a rather crazy family.

01:10:52.348 --> 01:10:53.337
Who doesn't?

01:10:55.384 --> 01:10:57.875
So, are you gonna need a ride back?

01:10:58.287 --> 01:10:59.413
Um...

01:10:59.855 --> 01:11:01.789
I'll see what's going on inside,

01:11:01.857 --> 01:11:05.725
I need to spend some quality time
with my family,

01:11:05.794 --> 01:11:09.093
and I'll call your cell
once the quality is over.

01:11:09.164 --> 01:11:12.725
- Hey, don't you want my number?
- I have it.

01:11:13.702 --> 01:11:16.796
I don't ever remember
giving you my cell phone.

01:11:17.906 --> 01:11:22.400
Yeah, right, I don't have it. I guess
I was thinking about somebody else.

01:11:22.678 --> 01:11:23.838
Uh...

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:27.180
I'll call you at the hotel, yeah?

01:11:30.252 --> 01:11:33.380
- So, I'll see you after your thing?
- Yeah.

01:11:33.455 --> 01:11:35.320
Call me.

01:11:35.391 --> 01:11:36.722
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:41.088
You did not just say that. "Call me?"

01:11:58.514 --> 01:12:00.505
Auntie.
- Priya!

01:12:00.582 --> 01:12:02.812
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:03.942
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:13.659
Do you remember me?

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:25.339
Come, let me show you around.

01:12:25.407 --> 01:12:26.931
You must eat something.

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:30.945
Pretty girl like you, your future husband
could have something to grab on.

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:32.002
Yeah, Auntie.

01:12:45.227 --> 01:12:48.719
I heard you're doing very well,
working for a big American company.

01:12:52.067 --> 01:12:55.400
- Your family must be very proud of you.
- I think so.

01:13:04.947 --> 01:13:06.107
Priya!

01:13:09.785 --> 01:13:10.979
Hello?

01:13:13.555 --> 01:13:17.047
Hi, I'm Granger. Nice to meet you.

01:13:18.727 --> 01:13:20.888
It's so nice, Papa,
that you've come for the party.

01:13:20.963 --> 01:13:21.952
Not another lie.

01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:23.956
Hi. How are you?

01:13:24.733 --> 01:13:25.961
Hello, hello.

01:13:26.034 --> 01:13:27.228
Granger Woodruff.

01:13:27.569 --> 01:13:30.561
I know why you are here
and it's certainly not for the family.

01:13:30.639 --> 01:13:32.698
Now where is the man
you've eloped with, huh?

01:13:32.808 --> 01:13:36.335
- What?
<i>- Ji, ji,</i> I think that is him.

01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:39.074
Priya, you left this in my car.

01:13:39.982 --> 01:13:41.950
I don't want you
to address my daughter, okay?

01:13:42.017 --> 01:13:43.143
Papa.

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:47.978
Mr. Sethi. Granger Woodruff.
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:51.417
What pleasure? Where is the pleasure?

01:13:51.493 --> 01:13:53.552
Granger, thanks for the present.
Can I talk to you later, please?

01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:55.153
No.

01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:59.394
I want to know what you told my daughter
to lure her to America.

01:13:59.468 --> 01:14:03.268
- What? What's your father talking about?
- Can we go to your car?

01:14:03.372 --> 01:14:06.068
You thought you will bring
an innocent girl here

01:14:06.141 --> 01:14:08.268
and I will not find you?

01:14:08.343 --> 01:14:11.039
Sir, sir, I just met your daughter
a few days ago.

01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:13.877
I'm not trying to lure her anywhere.

01:14:13.949 --> 01:14:15.644
- You are her customer.
- Papa...

01:14:15.717 --> 01:14:19.551
I mean, for the credit card company.
Don't you lie to us. Zia told us everything.

01:14:19.621 --> 01:14:21.282
Thank God,
Vikram's family does not know anything.

01:14:21.356 --> 01:14:23.483
Otherwise, you know
what could have happened.

01:14:23.559 --> 01:14:24.856
Credit card company?

01:14:24.927 --> 01:14:28.090
Yes, that horrible job
which makes her work the whole night

01:14:28.163 --> 01:14:30.097
pretending to be an <i>Americano.</i>

01:14:30.165 --> 01:14:35.228
Are you discussing Priya's job?
She does a fantastic American accent.

01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:39.798
Come on, do your Streisand voice.
It's just terrific.

01:14:39.875 --> 01:14:42.639
I'm sure your fiancé must enjoy it.

01:14:45.013 --> 01:14:46.571
You're engaged?

01:14:47.649 --> 01:14:50.174
Oh, no, no, no, no.
He's not asking as a jealous boyfriend,

01:14:50.252 --> 01:14:53.551
he's asking merely
as a polite conversation starter.

01:14:55.190 --> 01:14:56.316
Priya!

01:14:57.226 --> 01:14:59.091
Priya! Where are you going?

01:14:59.661 --> 01:15:02.459
Look, I'm not going anywhere until
you tell me what the hell is going on.

01:15:02.531 --> 01:15:05.261
Granger, not here, please. Come.

01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:10.732
You wanna tell me
who you really are?

01:15:10.806 --> 01:15:13.434
I'm Priya Sethi, I live in Mumbai,
just like I told you.

01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:15.306
And who else are you?

01:15:16.945 --> 01:15:20.540
I'm Jennifer David
from CITYone Bank Business Processes.

01:15:22.217 --> 01:15:25.618
Say something else. Say something else.

01:15:27.222 --> 01:15:29.190
I'll be happy to assist you
in increasing your credit limit,

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:30.725
if you wouldn't mind
answering a few questions.

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:33.920
Okay, all right, I got it.

01:15:36.832 --> 01:15:38.197
I'm sorry.

01:15:50.245 --> 01:15:52.975
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I was going to.

01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:57.844
I didn't think you'd like the real me.

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:02.551
You're engaged, is that how
they celebrate in your country?

01:16:02.624 --> 01:16:05.058
I don't love him. I...

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:11.332
I'm sorry I didn't tell you everything.
I pretend for my job.

01:16:14.303 --> 01:16:17.397
But the truth is everything else
I've told you.

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:21.638
I don't know what to believe.

01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:28.172
You know what? Forget it.

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:32.311
Yeah, I've known you
for, what, a few days?

01:16:32.387 --> 01:16:37.552
Let's not blow this thing out of proportion.
It was fun. Let's just leave it at that.

01:16:37.626 --> 01:16:39.287
Granger, please...

01:16:51.673 --> 01:16:52.901
Damn it!

01:16:52.975 --> 01:16:55.170
Stay away
from my daughter, okay?

01:16:55.243 --> 01:16:56.835
Who is that guy?

01:16:56.912 --> 01:16:58.277
Oh, my God.

01:17:09.257 --> 01:17:12.852
I always imagined Indian parties
to be peaceful affairs.

01:17:12.928 --> 01:17:19.492
You know, Gandhi-esque, incense
and <i>Kama Sutra.</i>

01:17:20.702 --> 01:17:22.670
Never have expectations.

01:17:23.772 --> 01:17:27.003
- You know what your deal is?
- No, what's my deal?

01:17:27.075 --> 01:17:29.737
You never totally put yourself out there.

01:17:29.811 --> 01:17:31.904
You round the corners
and you play it safe.

01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:34.141
You never let people
see who you really are,

01:17:34.216 --> 01:17:37.276
but you're selling yourself short, man.
Tired of watching you do that.

01:17:37.352 --> 01:17:41.482
If you want big rewards,
you have to take the big risks.

01:17:41.556 --> 01:17:44.616
But you're afraid,
so you wind up with nothing.

01:17:48.196 --> 01:17:52.724
Wow! This girl really took you out.

01:17:52.801 --> 01:17:56.066
So what? I'm just supposed to tell her
to leave her fiancé

01:17:56.138 --> 01:17:57.935
and move to America to be with me?

01:17:58.006 --> 01:18:00.440
I don't even know
if I'm gonna have a job next week.

01:18:00.509 --> 01:18:02.033
She pretended to be someone she wasn't,

01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:04.874
maybe that's who she needed to be
to have her big adventure.

01:18:04.946 --> 01:18:08.814
Haven't you ever pretended to be someone
you're not, Granger?

01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:19.420
For the last 37 years at
Hawksin Hotels, it's been our passion...

01:18:33.275 --> 01:18:36.870
- Happy birthday.
- Emory? What are you doing here?

01:18:37.813 --> 01:18:40.145
Well, I came to wish
you a happy birthday.

01:18:40.215 --> 01:18:43.616
Well, it's not my birthday,
and I thought we broke up.

01:18:43.685 --> 01:18:45.175
I forgive you.

01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:50.951
- Good luck, Priya.
- Thank you.

01:18:52.627 --> 01:18:54.857
Emory, I...

01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:58.058
Em... Em, Em, I can't do this, okay?

01:18:58.133 --> 01:19:01.000
I'm here for work,
I don't have time for this.

01:19:01.069 --> 01:19:04.664
Okay, whatever. You know,
it's actually probably for the best.

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:08.301
Since I wouldn't want
to remember us both naked when I do it.

01:19:08.376 --> 01:19:11.277
- Do what?
- Propose, you jerk.

01:19:12.814 --> 01:19:13.940
What?

01:19:16.952 --> 01:19:21.082
- You're joking, right?
- No, and that better not be your answer.

01:19:22.657 --> 01:19:26.184
I just thought, you know,
we were seeing other people.

01:19:26.261 --> 01:19:30.493
- You know, Mark Bailey, private jets.
- Let's review, sweetie, okay?

01:19:30.565 --> 01:19:34.296
We are both good-looking.
We both went to Ivy League schools.

01:19:35.670 --> 01:19:37.433
The sex is amazing.

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:41.106
You make it sound like a merger.

01:19:43.845 --> 01:19:47.906
You're never going to find anyone
better than me, and you know it.

01:19:48.884 --> 01:19:50.146
Em, Em...

01:20:01.363 --> 01:20:03.092
Priya.

01:20:03.165 --> 01:20:05.759
Before you close your door, please...

01:20:09.437 --> 01:20:13.601
I know I should have had told you
I was engaged. I'm sorry.

01:20:16.478 --> 01:20:21.074
But the truth is,
maybe I did come all the way

01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:25.347
wanting a romantic moment
with someone I've never met

01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:29.117
because maybe I was running away
from my life.

01:20:29.191 --> 01:20:35.323
And then I met you, my feet stayed still.
Maybe they floated a little.

01:20:39.801 --> 01:20:43.532
I couldn't leave tomorrow
without you knowing how I feel.

01:20:43.605 --> 01:20:47.200
- And I hope that maybe you've...
- Grange?

01:20:47.275 --> 01:20:50.904
Is my fiancé bugging
you for towels again?

01:20:50.979 --> 01:20:52.776
- It's not...
- Necessary.

01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:55.442
Oh, and we're not going
to need turndown service later

01:20:55.517 --> 01:20:58.315
because, well,
we're just going to mess it up.

01:20:58.386 --> 01:21:00.411
Just give me a minute, Em.

01:21:01.456 --> 01:21:02.684
Hey!

01:21:02.757 --> 01:21:06.716
You don't need to explain it to the maid.
It's a hotel, for gosh sake!

01:21:06.795 --> 01:21:08.285
- Look, I'm...
- That's right.

01:21:08.363 --> 01:21:09.421
I should have looked,

01:21:10.565 --> 01:21:12.556
then I'd have seen what a hypocrite...

01:21:12.634 --> 01:21:15.797
That's the English word, right?
Someone like you.

01:21:17.806 --> 01:21:22.869
You're going back to India to your fiancé.
What do you want me to do?

01:21:28.917 --> 01:21:31.317
You'll like this one.
So these two lawyers go to heaven,

01:21:31.386 --> 01:21:33.650
and they meet Saint Peter...
You guys heard of Saint Peter?

01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:37.256
Let's just walk around
the man in the towel.

01:21:38.493 --> 01:21:40.859
Which reminds me,
those are the 300 count cotton towels.

01:21:40.929 --> 01:21:43.454
Egyptian cotton, too,
I think it's the best.

01:22:09.124 --> 01:22:12.787

So what do you think, Mr. Hawksin?

01:22:51.099 --> 01:22:52.464
I loved it.

01:23:00.775 --> 01:23:03.608
- Welcome to the Hawksin family, boys.
- Yes!

01:23:05.146 --> 01:23:07.011
- Thank you very much, sir.
- "Nice people like you."

01:23:07.082 --> 01:23:09.812
- I like that, it's a good touch.
- Thank you, I got it...

01:23:23.765 --> 01:23:25.892
What is the meaning of all this?

01:23:25.967 --> 01:23:29.767
- You're home so soon?
- Wow, full on rager.

01:23:29.838 --> 01:23:32.306
Who told you you could have a party?
And what are you celebrating?

01:23:32.374 --> 01:23:33.466
Ow!

01:23:33.541 --> 01:23:37.910
That's it. My children are hooligans.
I've done nothing right.

01:23:37.979 --> 01:23:39.139
Just go to weeds.

01:23:39.214 --> 01:23:40.681
Oh, no, please, please, please,
one minute.

01:23:40.749 --> 01:23:42.740
He is probably following
the example of his sister

01:23:42.817 --> 01:23:44.546
to see who can humiliate the family more.

01:23:44.619 --> 01:23:48.055
He with the party or she who ran away
to America with some stranger.

01:23:48.123 --> 01:23:51.115
Definitely the one who ran away.

01:23:51.192 --> 01:23:53.626
- Nothing happened.
- Nothing happened?

01:23:53.695 --> 01:23:55.856
You spent all your money
just to go to America?

01:23:55.930 --> 01:23:57.727
Thank God, the only blessed thing
that has happened

01:23:57.799 --> 01:23:59.528
the Bhatias have not found out.

01:23:59.601 --> 01:24:03.059
Oh, by the way,
Mr. Bhatia had left a message.

01:24:03.138 --> 01:24:05.038
He found out what happened
from Uncle Sawant.

01:24:06.307 --> 01:24:10.641
Dad, Dad.
<i>- Ji, ji, ji, ji,</i> you're going to have a stroke.

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:13.909
Tomorrow, you're going to Bhatia's place,
kiss their feet

01:24:13.982 --> 01:24:15.882
and apologize
for what you have done, okay?

01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:18.851
And beg forgiveness with the hope
that they let this marriage take place.

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:20.683
- What if...
- Not, what if, anything.

01:24:20.755 --> 01:24:22.188
The only thing you're supposed to see

01:24:22.257 --> 01:24:25.624
is to obey your father and most probably
that future husband of yours.

01:24:25.693 --> 01:24:27.456
Now go to your room.

01:24:28.963 --> 01:24:30.260
- Papa.
- What?

01:24:30.331 --> 01:24:33.767
Please try to understand,
I don't want to marry Vikram.

01:24:33.835 --> 01:24:37.464
Papa, Vikram is a perfectly nice boy.

01:24:37.539 --> 01:24:41.202
It's just, I know he won't make me happy.

01:24:41.276 --> 01:24:44.074
What? What did she say? Happy?

01:24:45.513 --> 01:24:48.676
You think I was happy
when I met your mother?

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:50.650
I mean...

01:24:50.718 --> 01:24:54.814
But now, just look at us,
we have grown to be happy.

01:24:54.889 --> 01:24:57.585
Till our children came to make us crazy.

01:24:57.659 --> 01:25:00.492
So don't you talk to me
about being happy.

01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:06.064
All my life I've been thinking
about making other people happy.

01:25:06.134 --> 01:25:10.070
Now, I need to know what makes me
happy. Not you, you or Vikram.

01:25:10.138 --> 01:25:12.766
What is this me, me, me?
Crazy American talk!

01:25:12.841 --> 01:25:17.869
Okay, okay. Priya.
You see, you are part of a family.

01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:23.074
And you are not entitled to hog
all the happiness just for yourself.

01:25:23.151 --> 01:25:26.143
There are other people in this family
who also want to be happy.

01:25:26.221 --> 01:25:31.124
But what you've done all this time?
Just break our hearts.

01:25:31.626 --> 01:25:34.618
<i>- Ji, ji, ji...</i>
- No, no...

01:25:34.696 --> 01:25:39.998
<i>Ji,</i> you're not feeling well.
I'll talk to her, huh?

01:25:40.902 --> 01:25:43.462
Priya...

01:25:47.609 --> 01:25:51.238
Look, Priya.
This marriage is not just about you.

01:25:51.746 --> 01:25:53.646
It is for us.

01:25:54.115 --> 01:25:56.310
This will help our family, <i>beta.</i>

01:25:56.384 --> 01:25:59.444
Look at your father.
See how hard he works.

01:26:00.188 --> 01:26:03.157
This is important, Priya. Huh?

01:26:06.895 --> 01:26:09.090
Family's important, <i>beta.</i>

01:26:09.564 --> 01:26:13.091
It is who will always
be there for you, huh?

01:26:15.003 --> 01:26:17.870
<i>This is the air I breathe</i>

01:26:32.086 --> 01:26:34.486
- Knock, knock. Hi.
- Hey.

01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:39.182
Look, I know we haven't had a
chance to talk, really, since San Francisco.

01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:42.058
You know, I wanted to tell you that if
the wedding stuff is too much for you,

01:26:42.130 --> 01:26:45.429
let's just celebrate
your new account, okay?

01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:48.094
Look. It's your favorite.

01:26:55.843 --> 01:26:59.711
- It's not working.
- What, did you lose the account?

01:27:06.955 --> 01:27:07.944
Right.

01:27:12.126 --> 01:27:13.115
Okay.

01:27:17.732 --> 01:27:22.101
Once again, and make it sound
this time like you mean it.

01:27:23.671 --> 01:27:26.401
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Louder, louder.

01:27:29.577 --> 01:27:31.374
I'm terribly sorry, Uncle, Auntie.

01:27:31.446 --> 01:27:34.006
I've gotten everything out of my system.

01:27:34.082 --> 01:27:36.243
And I assure you
I'm ready to be a devoted...

01:27:36.317 --> 01:27:37.511
Devoted wife and mother.

01:27:38.853 --> 01:27:41.822
I'm ready to devote myself to...

01:27:41.889 --> 01:27:43.322
Come on.

01:27:48.696 --> 01:27:53.656
I'm ready to devote myself to my job
and finding things that make me happy.

01:27:55.136 --> 01:27:58.628
'Cause I lied. I haven't gotten
everything out of my system.

01:27:58.706 --> 01:28:02.608
What system?
She's too young to have a system.

01:28:03.378 --> 01:28:05.437
She's nervous.

01:28:06.314 --> 01:28:10.375
She's embarrassed and she's afraid

01:28:10.451 --> 01:28:13.511
because she thinks that
you will not accept her apology.

01:28:13.588 --> 01:28:15.886
Isn't that right, Priya, huh?

01:28:16.924 --> 01:28:22.362
I'm sorry. Vikram is a lovely person.

01:28:23.531 --> 01:28:27.365
And I know, Vikram, you'll find someone
who'll make you happy.

01:28:27.502 --> 01:28:29.936
But I don't believe it's me.

01:28:34.309 --> 01:28:36.209
I know I'm disappointing you.

01:28:37.178 --> 01:28:39.738
It's just, something happened
when I was gone.

01:28:40.615 --> 01:28:42.412
I jumped in the ocean.

01:28:44.052 --> 01:28:46.111
I got sick eating chocolates.

01:28:47.422 --> 01:28:49.049
I just fell in love.

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:52.888
Is this man here with you?

01:28:53.494 --> 01:28:56.190
No, Vikram. It's just...

01:28:56.831 --> 01:28:58.856
I realize I need something else.

01:28:59.434 --> 01:29:03.461
I told you they're all mad as hatters.
Didn't I? Didn't I?

01:29:03.538 --> 01:29:06.098
How dare you do this to our son?

01:29:06.641 --> 01:29:09.201
- It's not enough that you...
- Now, that is okay.

01:29:09.277 --> 01:29:12.440
We have a whole file
full of girls in there.

01:29:12.513 --> 01:29:16.279
And I really always wanted to
meet Lavina from Gwalior.

01:29:16.351 --> 01:29:19.149
No, it's not all right, Vikram.
It's not all right.

01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:22.656
This little tramp runs off to America,
then stands here and breaks your heart...

01:29:22.724 --> 01:29:28.629
She's not a tramp! She's not a tramp.

01:29:31.899 --> 01:29:33.594
She's a dreamer.

01:29:35.770 --> 01:29:38.102
Her ideas are modern.

01:29:38.606 --> 01:29:42.372
Yes, sometimes she's
stubborn and willful,

01:29:42.443 --> 01:29:46.004
but when she walks into a room,
people smile.

01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:51.947
When she talks, people listen.

01:29:53.755 --> 01:29:56.417
She's wise. She's kind.

01:29:58.726 --> 01:30:02.822
And most importantly, she's my daughter.

01:30:05.299 --> 01:30:06.891
And I love her.

01:30:07.101 --> 01:30:08.193
Papa.

01:30:14.842 --> 01:30:16.241
Thank you.

01:30:18.546 --> 01:30:20.446
<i>This is the air I breathe</i>

01:30:20.515 --> 01:30:23.609
<i>Hello, everyone. I'm Priya Sethi.</i>

01:30:24.419 --> 01:30:26.478
<i>I'm also known as Jennifer David.</i>

01:30:27.522 --> 01:30:32.585
I've recently taken over from Miss Prasad
who was promoted to Regional Manager.

01:30:33.461 --> 01:30:37.955
<i>So, I welcome you all to</i>
<i>CITYone Business Processes.</i>

01:30:39.033 --> 01:30:42.935
<i>As you all know, you'll be spending</i>
<i>12 hours of your day</i>

01:30:43.671 --> 01:30:45.332
as an American.

01:30:46.674 --> 01:30:48.574
<i>You'll have an American name,</i>

01:30:49.210 --> 01:30:51.701
<i>an American city of residence,</i>

01:30:53.381 --> 01:30:58.785
<i>but it's very important to remember</i>
<i>that you're not an American.</i>

01:31:00.955 --> 01:31:06.257
You're an Indian and your
American identity is simply there

01:31:06.961 --> 01:31:10.590
<i>to make it easier for
you to communicate</i>

01:31:10.665 --> 01:31:14.328
with the person
at the other end of the line.

01:31:14.402 --> 01:31:19.169
But you must leave it at your desk
the moment you take off the headset.

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:21.333
<i>I'm desperate for you</i>

01:31:30.785 --> 01:31:35.381
Excuse me, everybody. It's time
for the customary best man speech.

01:31:36.991 --> 01:31:41.121
When Charlie and I were 14,
we went to Camp Whichiwawa

01:31:42.630 --> 01:31:45.690
and being the mischievous
little fellows that we were,

01:31:45.766 --> 01:31:49.065
one night we decided to
sneak across to the girls' cabins.

01:31:49.136 --> 01:31:53.630
Now, the only way to get over to Camp
Whichiwuwu was over this little river.

01:31:54.075 --> 01:31:59.206
Now, to the 14-year-old me, in the middle
of the night, it looked like the Mississippi.

01:31:59.547 --> 01:32:03.278
You know, so I say to Charlie,
I say, "Dude, I'm not going in there.

01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:08.186
"It's probably full of snakes and eels
and crocodiles,"

01:32:08.256 --> 01:32:11.191
and by the time I'd finished
listing all my reasons,

01:32:11.259 --> 01:32:14.251
Chucky boy here was already
on the other side.

01:32:14.328 --> 01:32:17.559
I chickened out
and went back to the cabins.

01:32:17.965 --> 01:32:22.595
But Charlie here,
he forged ahead to the girls' cabins

01:32:23.404 --> 01:32:26.635
and he met a young lady that night,
believe it or not.

01:32:28.843 --> 01:32:31.004
A young lady named Karen Miller.

01:32:32.113 --> 01:32:34.104
Now, when Charlie got back to the bunks,
he says to me, he says,

01:32:34.181 --> 01:32:37.776
"Dude, dude, I just met the girl
I'm gonna marry."

01:32:39.687 --> 01:32:45.148
Flash forward 10 years later, Charlie and I
are at a barbeque at Massapequa or

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:51.699
Quitipeak or Quahog or somewhere,
then he sees her across the room.

01:32:53.034 --> 01:32:54.831
Now, Charlie was on a date that night,

01:32:54.902 --> 01:32:56.426
but he left her just like he left me

01:32:56.504 --> 01:32:59.132
on the other side of that river
10 years earlier.

01:32:59.206 --> 01:33:03.609
And me being the voice of reason,
I say to Charlie, I say, "You can't leave,"

01:33:04.011 --> 01:33:06.445
and he turns to me and
he says something I'll never forget.

01:33:06.514 --> 01:33:11.349
He says, "Nothing should ever hold a man
back from his future."

01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:15.919
Nothing should ever hold a man
back from his future.

01:33:20.328 --> 01:33:25.527
So, to my best friend, Charlie,
who wasn't afraid to cross the river,

01:33:28.703 --> 01:33:32.298
and to Karen,
who was waiting for him on the other...

01:33:50.891 --> 01:33:52.483
I gotta go.

01:34:05.239 --> 01:34:07.070
Taxi! Hey!

01:34:10.711 --> 01:34:14.010
How're you doing?
Airport. As fast as you can.

01:34:15.483 --> 01:34:20.182
<i>Hear me out, don't tear away</i>
<i>'Cause this is what I'm trying to say</i>

01:34:20.254 --> 01:34:25.021
Hey, hey, would you mind stepping on it?
I got to get to the airport in 40 minutes.

01:34:25.092 --> 01:34:26.616
Hey, dude,
I'm trying to go as fast as I can.

01:34:26.694 --> 01:34:29.185
Okay, thank you. Okay, thanks.
Very important.

01:34:29.263 --> 01:34:30.321
- Appreciate it.
- Sure.

01:34:30.398 --> 01:34:34.391
Hi, hi, yes,
I need information for Mumbai, India.

01:34:34.969 --> 01:34:37.062
Yeah, I can hold.

01:34:37.838 --> 01:34:44.505
Yes, yes, I'm here. I'm looking for the
address to CITYone Bank Headquarters.

01:34:45.346 --> 01:34:49.282
C-l-T-I, yes, yes.

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:53.582
Wait, wait, wait, slow down.
I can't understand you, I...

01:34:53.788 --> 01:34:56.586
- Hold, hold on, please.
- Come on!

01:34:56.957 --> 01:34:59.425
- Excuse me, hey, buddy...
- What?

01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:01.027
Would you mind translating
for me, please?

01:35:01.095 --> 01:35:04.690
Okay, just because I'm brown and driving
a taxi doesn't mean I can speak Indian.

01:35:04.765 --> 01:35:07.097
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I didn't mean that.

01:35:07.168 --> 01:35:08.931
Dude, I'm playing, I'm playing with you.
Give me the phone.

01:35:09.003 --> 01:35:10.698
- Thanks, man. Thank you.
- It's all right.

01:35:15.743 --> 01:35:19.144
CITYone Bank address, Headquarters,
Mumbai.

01:35:19.213 --> 01:35:21.374
I can write down. I have a pen.

01:35:23.250 --> 01:35:26.151
<i>I can't see your face</i>

01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:28.347
<i>You're calling out my name</i>

01:35:30.357 --> 01:35:34.555
<i>I can hear you calling out my name</i>

01:35:34.628 --> 01:35:36.528
Hey. Watch it.

01:35:36.597 --> 01:35:38.724
<i>I can't see your face</i>

01:35:38.799 --> 01:35:42.291
<i>But you're calling out my name</i>

01:35:44.972 --> 01:35:50.911
<i>And all this time you let me run</i>

01:35:51.746 --> 01:35:57.412
<i>Look how fast time has gone</i>

01:35:58.152 --> 01:36:03.317
<i>Looking back at what we had</i>

01:36:03.390 --> 01:36:06.587
Hey, buddy.
Can't this thing go any faster?

01:36:07.695 --> 01:36:09.788
Can your cab go any faster?

01:36:21.909 --> 01:36:23.467
Stop and let me out.

01:36:34.455 --> 01:36:36.082
CITYone Bank.

01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:51.765
I'd be glad to help you with that.

01:36:51.839 --> 01:36:55.036
For security purposes, could you please
give me the last four digits of your social...

01:37:00.114 --> 01:37:03.208
No, you listen to me.
No, sir, you listen to me.

01:37:03.751 --> 01:37:07.278
Just listen here, Jack.
You better pay up or else...

01:37:07.955 --> 01:37:09.081
He hung up on me.

01:37:09.156 --> 01:37:12.819
Balveer, you must always remember.
They are your customers.

01:37:12.893 --> 01:37:17.262
So, do not let things get personal.
This is a business, right?

01:37:17.498 --> 01:37:21.764
And your job is to be professional,
calm and helpful.

01:37:22.169 --> 01:37:23.500
But we must get the money.

01:37:23.571 --> 01:37:26.438
How can we let these obnoxious
Americans talk to us like this?

01:37:26.507 --> 01:37:30.034
What happens if the obnoxious American
is also a complete idiot?

01:37:35.316 --> 01:37:39.980
And he's sorry it took him so long
to realize what a mistake he made.

01:37:41.255 --> 01:37:43.382
How did you...

01:37:43.457 --> 01:37:47.689
Well, I had to body check an old lady,

01:37:48.329 --> 01:37:51.765
employ a taxi cab translator, don't ask,

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:55.300
fly 18 hours,

01:37:57.371 --> 01:37:58.770
hijack a tuk-tuk,

01:38:00.574 --> 01:38:03.042
and bribe a street gypsy,

01:38:03.644 --> 01:38:05.908
and I did it all in this monkey suit.

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:08.412
I kind of feel like James Bond.

01:38:10.251 --> 01:38:13.414
Only I probably don't
smell as good as he does.

01:38:14.221 --> 01:38:17.782
- I think you smell great.
- Thanks.

01:38:27.968 --> 01:38:31.028
I couldn't get married.

01:38:34.341 --> 01:38:37.071
Well, it's a pretty big deal.

01:38:38.045 --> 01:38:39.945
Sort of like a platinum card.

01:38:40.681 --> 01:38:44.674
Once you make that commitment,
you really have to see it through.

01:38:45.386 --> 01:38:47.183
But I think I'd like that.

01:38:50.624 --> 01:38:52.819
Kiss him. Kiss him.

01:39:16.350 --> 01:39:18.045
You sure
this is such a good idea?

01:39:18.118 --> 01:39:20.177
Don't worry, it'll be good.

01:39:21.221 --> 01:39:22.347
Best of luck.

01:39:27.127 --> 01:39:32.827
Sir, before you take a swing,
there's something I want to read to you.

01:39:51.285 --> 01:39:53.776
Try English, boy. You're hurting my ears.

01:39:56.957 --> 01:40:01.951
I just wanted you to know that I have the
utmost respect for you and your family.

01:40:04.198 --> 01:40:08.862
And I promise to treat your daughter with
all the love and respect she deserves.

01:40:19.546 --> 01:40:21.309
You like <i>alu parathas?</i>

01:40:25.819 --> 01:40:27.650
Let's give him <i>alu parathas.</i>

01:40:27.955 --> 01:40:29.047
Sit, sit.

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:45.570
<i>Wise men say</i>

01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:52.840
<i>Only fools rush in</i>

01:40:54.448 --> 01:40:59.351
<i>But I can't help</i>

01:41:00.354 --> 01:41:06.725
<i>Falling in love with you</i>

01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:15.198
<i>Shall I stay</i>

01:41:16.336 --> 01:41:21.968
<i>Would it be a sin?</i>

01:41:23.944 --> 01:41:29.746
<i>If I can't help</i>

01:41:29.817 --> 01:41:36.347
<i>Falling in love with you</i>

01:41:38.826 --> 01:41:42.455
<i>Like a river flows</i>

01:41:42.529 --> 01:41:46.226
<i>Surely to the sea</i>

01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:49.792
<i>Darling, so it goes</i>

01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:56.776
<i>Some things are meant to be</i>

01:41:57.344 --> 01:42:03.249
<i>Take my hand</i>

01:42:03.817 --> 01:42:10.120
<i>Take my whole life, too</i>

01:42:11.758 --> 01:42:17.526
<i>For I can't help</i>

01:42:17.598 --> 01:42:24.026
<i>Falling in love with you</i>

01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:30.267
<i>Like a river flows</i>

01:42:30.344 --> 01:42:34.075
<i>Surely to the sea</i>

01:42:34.148 --> 01:42:37.640
<i>Darling, so it goes</i>

01:42:37.718 --> 01:42:44.647
<i>Some things are meant to be</i>

01:42:45.125 --> 01:42:50.427
<i>Take my hand</i>

01:42:51.565 --> 01:42:58.300
<i>Take my whole life, too</i>

01:42:59.206 --> 01:43:05.270
<i>For I can't help</i>

01:43:05.345 --> 01:43:12.080
<i>Falling in love with you</i>

01:43:14.221 --> 01:43:19.887
<i>Oh, I can't help</i>

01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:26.889
