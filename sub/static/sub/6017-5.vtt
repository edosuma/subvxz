00:02.035 --> 00:03.866
At a hospital, the treatment
is to lie in a bed.

00:05.205 --> 00:07.605
Whatever's wrong with
a human being, lie down.

00:07.774 --> 00:10.971
Doctor never says, "Well, your
condition isn't as bad as we thought.

00:11.144 --> 00:14.773
We want you to kind of lean against
a doorjamb for seven to 10 days.

00:14.948 --> 00:16.779
See how that feels."

00:16.950 --> 00:19.282
Always a bed. Unless you
go to the emergency room...

00:19.452 --> 00:22.012
...then it's a chair. You've been shot,
stabbed, run over:

00:22.188 --> 00:23.587
"Have a seat."

00:24.524 --> 00:28.893
There's always an interesting cultural,
ethnic mix to the hospital staff.

00:29.062 --> 00:30.859
It's like a local news team in there.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.932
The doctor's the anchorman.
He's got white hair, he's in charge.

00:34.100 --> 00:36.125
The nurse is the feature reporter,
you know.

00:36.302 --> 00:40.102
You listen to her, but it's always,
"And now, back to your doctor."

00:40.306 --> 00:42.365
The orderlies come in
with food and bedpans.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.737
That's like your sports and weather.

00:50.316 --> 00:53.080
Then the baby's head comes out,
and I'm screaming.

00:53.253 --> 00:55.380
My brother, who's videotaping,
turns green.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.682
His eyes roll up in his head,
and he blacks out.

00:57.857 --> 00:59.552
He drops the camera,
the camera breaks.

00:59.726 --> 01:02.559
And then the placenta
comes flying out.

01:04.897 --> 01:08.390
-And then a doctor says...
-Hey, thanks. That's enough.

01:08.568 --> 01:12.402
Will you look at that kid. Sucking
away like there's no tomorrow.

01:12.572 --> 01:15.473
Suck, suck, suck.

01:15.642 --> 01:17.303
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:17.477 --> 01:20.742
-Look at that, Jerry, look at that.
-Yeah, I looked. I saw it.

01:21.214 --> 01:24.274
-Does this make you uncomfortable?
-No, no.

01:24.451 --> 01:25.941
Uncomfortable? Not at all.

01:26.119 --> 01:29.145
My friend's wife's breasts are out.
Why would I be uncomfortable?

01:29.322 --> 01:30.949
Look at him.

01:31.124 --> 01:33.251
-So how long do they do this?
-Year or two.

01:33.860 --> 01:35.589
No break?

01:36.863 --> 01:39.559
-After that comes the weaning.
-After sucking comes weaning?

01:39.732 --> 01:41.723
-First sucking, then weaning.
-You gotta wean.

01:41.901 --> 01:43.630
-Gotta wean.
-Must wean.

01:48.141 --> 01:51.542
-What about that spot I got, huh?
-Yeah. I saw the spot.

01:51.711 --> 01:53.110
You open the door to the car...

01:53.279 --> 01:56.442
...you walk right into the hospital.
You can't beat that spot.

01:57.383 --> 02:00.318
I am on a roll. Yeah.

02:00.487 --> 02:02.455
I'm just willing these
great parking spots.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.249
George.

02:05.892 --> 02:08.326
Maybe the baby would
like to see the spot.

02:08.495 --> 02:11.521
A positive, uplifting message
to start his life out with, huh?

02:11.698 --> 02:15.828
You can still get a great spot
in this city if you apply yourself.

02:16.002 --> 02:17.663
Where's Kramer?
Shouldn't he be here?

02:17.837 --> 02:20.237
-Did you give him the room number?
-Yeah, 1397.

02:20.406 --> 02:22.966
1937.

02:24.010 --> 02:26.171
1937, 1937.

02:26.346 --> 02:28.746
Excuse me. Do you know
where the elevator is?

02:28.915 --> 02:32.851
Yeah, it's right around
the corner there. 1937.

02:43.596 --> 02:45.587
Oh, God!

02:46.266 --> 02:48.461
It's a pig-man.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.402
A pig-man!

02:52.572 --> 02:55.837
So anyway, Jerry, Elaine, we have
something we wanna ask you.

02:56.009 --> 02:58.739
You gotta look. I pulled
it in perfectly equidistant...

02:58.912 --> 03:02.006
...from the car in front and behind.
-Would you shut up, George?

03:02.182 --> 03:04.844
I'm taking a cab home.
I can't take this anymore.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.350
You were saying, Stan.
I'm sorry about this.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.545
Myra and I would like
you and Elaine...

03:09.722 --> 03:11.917
...to be the godparents of Steven.

03:13.293 --> 03:15.523
-Me? A godfather?
-Yes.

03:16.663 --> 03:19.257
Never go against the family, Elaine.

03:20.833 --> 03:22.095
What?

03:22.268 --> 03:25.431
Hey, I just saw a pig-man.
A pig-man.

03:25.905 --> 03:28.533
He was sleeping, and then
he woke up and he looked at me...

03:28.708 --> 03:31.871
...and he made
this horrible sound, this:

03:35.215 --> 03:36.910
Kramer, what are you talking about?

03:37.083 --> 03:40.610
I'm talking about a pig-man. I walked
in the wrong room, and there he was.

03:40.787 --> 03:44.553
-A pig-man?
-A pig-man. Half pig, half man.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.055
That's great, Kramer.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.662
Anyway, tell us what's involved
in being a godparent.

03:49.829 --> 03:51.888
Elaine, never ask me
about my business.

03:53.099 --> 03:55.192
Godfather?

03:56.069 --> 03:58.401
The most important thing
is you help with the bris.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.596
-The bris?
-A bris?

04:00.773 --> 04:03.139
-You mean, circumcision?
-Yeah.

04:03.876 --> 04:06.401
I would advise against that.

04:07.413 --> 04:08.812
Kramer, it's a tradition.

04:08.982 --> 04:12.247
So was sacrificing virgins
to appease the gods...

04:12.418 --> 04:16.149
...but we don't do that anymore.
-Well, maybe we should.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.252
Hey...

04:18.423 --> 04:21.052
...why are all those people
milling around my car?

04:21.226 --> 04:24.458
-I don't know.
-Maybe they're admiring your spot.

04:24.631 --> 04:28.158
-They're looking up.
-Hey, there's a guy up on the roof.

04:29.002 --> 04:31.903
That's the guy I told
where the elevator was.

04:33.873 --> 04:37.138
Oh, God, I hope he doesn't jump...
Oh, my God!

04:39.879 --> 04:41.676
My car!

04:41.848 --> 04:44.612
My car!

04:47.520 --> 04:50.887
A mohel? What the hell is a mohel?

04:51.057 --> 04:54.117
A mohel is the person that
performs a circumcision.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.660
Well, where am I gonna find
a mohel?

04:56.829 --> 04:59.195
Motels, models...

04:59.899 --> 05:02.265
How do you find a mohel?

05:02.802 --> 05:05.134
Finding a mohel's easy.
Any idiot can find a mohel.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.967
I have to hold the baby
while they do it.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.905
That's a tough job.
How would you like that?

05:11.177 --> 05:12.974
Hey, Jerry, you ever seen one?

05:13.780 --> 05:16.214
-Oh, you mean, that wasn't..?
-Yeah.

05:16.382 --> 05:19.510
-No, you?
-Yeah.

05:20.787 --> 05:22.516
What'd you think?

05:24.457 --> 05:26.857
It had no face, no personality.

05:31.564 --> 05:34.328
It was like a Martian.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.697
-But, hey, you know, that's me.
-Hey.

05:38.604 --> 05:40.094
Well, I got the estimate.

05:40.273 --> 05:42.867
It'll cost more to repair the roof
than the car is worth.

05:43.042 --> 05:45.704
I'm going over and seeing
that hospital administrator today.

05:45.878 --> 05:48.506
Someone is gonna pay for this,
and it's not gonna be me!

05:48.681 --> 05:51.514
-Oh, you're screwed.
-I know.

05:53.086 --> 05:56.681
Swan dives from 20 floors up,
lands right on top.

05:56.856 --> 05:59.256
What, do I got a bull's-eye
up there?

05:59.425 --> 06:02.053
He couldn't move over
two feet, huh?

06:02.228 --> 06:06.062
Land on the sidewalk,
it's city property.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.864
Well, I have to interview a mohel.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.265
How about our little Elaine, huh?

06:11.437 --> 06:13.962
Attended the finest schools
on the eastern seaboard...

06:14.140 --> 06:17.906
...equestrian competitions,
debutante balls. Look at her now.

06:18.077 --> 06:20.705
Interviewing mohels.

06:21.647 --> 06:23.512
Yeah!

06:25.551 --> 06:27.075
-What's the matter?
-You all right?

06:27.253 --> 06:30.882
Don't ever question my instincts,
because my instincts are honed.

06:31.057 --> 06:33.548
-Look at that. Look, look.
-What now?

06:33.726 --> 06:36.559
"Hospital receives grant
to conduct DNA research.

06:36.729 --> 06:40.221
Government funds genetic research
at area hospital." Yeah, so?

06:40.400 --> 06:43.301
Pig-man, baby, pig-man.

06:43.870 --> 06:46.930
If I have to hear about this pig-man
one more time...

06:47.106 --> 06:49.666
Hey, I'm telling you,
the pig-man is alive.

06:49.842 --> 06:53.243
The government's been experimenting
with pig-men since the '50s.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.813
Just because the hospital's
conducting DNA research...

06:55.982 --> 06:58.109
...doesn't mean they're
creating mutant pig-men.

06:58.284 --> 07:02.277
Jerry, will you wake up to reality?
It's a military thing.

07:02.455 --> 07:06.391
They're probably creating
a whole army of pig warriors.

07:09.395 --> 07:12.796
I'll tell you something.
I wish there were pig-men.

07:12.965 --> 07:17.026
Get a few pig-men walking around,
suddenly I'm looking a lot better.

07:17.203 --> 07:21.469
If someone wanted to fix me up, they
could say, "At least he's no pig-man."

07:21.641 --> 07:24.439
Believe me, there'd be plenty
of women going for these pig-men.

07:24.877 --> 07:28.074
Whatever the deformity, there's
always some group attracted to it.

07:28.514 --> 07:31.142
"That little tail really turns me on."

07:31.317 --> 07:33.285
That's just about enough.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.115
-This doesn't interest you?
-Oh, no, it's fascinating...

07:36.289 --> 07:37.688
...but could you do me a favor?

07:38.157 --> 07:39.385
Could you tape...

07:39.559 --> 07:42.824
...the rest of the "pig-men and the
women who love them" discussion?

07:42.995 --> 07:45.759
And I'll listen to it
the next time I'm here.

07:45.932 --> 07:47.627
I gotta go find a mohel.

07:47.800 --> 07:51.167
You know, you should call that off,
Elaine. It's a barbaric ritual.

07:52.138 --> 07:57.542
Perhaps one day when the pig-men
roam free, it will be stopped, Kramer.

07:57.710 --> 08:01.146
Until then, off with their heads.

08:03.282 --> 08:06.843
-Kramer, isn't it a question of hygiene?
-It's a myth.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.915
Besides, it makes sex
more pleasurable.

08:09.088 --> 08:12.216
Yeah. So how does that help me?

08:12.391 --> 08:14.916
-George, you ever see one?
-Yeah, my roommate in college.

08:15.094 --> 08:16.994
Yeah, what'd you think?

08:17.663 --> 08:19.494
I got used to it.

08:21.834 --> 08:24.394
All right, I wanna see the pig-man.
Show me the pig-man.

08:24.570 --> 08:27.198
Don't worry, I'll show you.
And you'll never be the same.

08:27.373 --> 08:29.432
Maybe he's just a guy
with a nose like this:

08:29.609 --> 08:33.067
A lot of people have a nose like this.
They're not necessarily pig-men.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.510
Believe me, Jerry,
somewhere in this hospital...

08:35.681 --> 08:38.206
...the anguished oink of pig-man
cries out for help.

08:38.384 --> 08:41.683
Yeah, well, if I hear
an anguished oink, I'm out of here.

08:41.854 --> 08:43.515
I don't see any pig-men.

08:43.856 --> 08:47.087
I see human, human, human.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.488
-Wait a second.
-What?

08:48.661 --> 08:50.788
Oh, it's George.

08:51.597 --> 08:54.566
The administrator's on the third floor.
I'll meet you at the car.

08:54.734 --> 08:58.067
Wait, George. You got room
in the car for the pig-man, huh?

08:58.237 --> 09:00.467
The pig-man can take the bus.

09:00.640 --> 09:03.973
George, if the pig-man had a car,
he would give you a ride.

09:04.977 --> 09:07.878
How do you know? What if
the pig-man had a two-seater?

09:08.047 --> 09:10.413
Be realistic, George.

09:12.652 --> 09:17.282
I'll tell you what, if pig-man shows up,
we'll squeeze him in.

09:17.623 --> 09:19.113
-I'll see you later.
-Yeah.

09:19.292 --> 09:22.318
-Mr. Costanza, come in, come in.
-Thank you.

09:22.495 --> 09:25.896
It's been a very trying couple of days
around the hospital.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.727
Doctors, patients, everyone...

09:28.901 --> 09:31.927
...just grief-stricken over
this unfortunate occurrence.

09:32.104 --> 09:33.969
Well, I join them in their grief.

09:34.740 --> 09:39.336
Horrible thing. Flew right
past the children's wing.

09:39.512 --> 09:43.608
All the sick children in the playroom,
looking out the window...

09:43.783 --> 09:46.183
...just traumatized by the incident.

09:46.352 --> 09:49.947
Apparently they thought he was flying.
You know how children are.

09:50.122 --> 09:53.319
"Oh, look, a man is flying.
A man is flying!"

09:53.492 --> 09:55.892
And then splat.

09:56.295 --> 09:58.593
That's where I come in.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.925
On "splat."

10:01.100 --> 10:04.866
You see, Mrs. Sweedler... Or is it
Hospital Administrator Sweedler?

10:05.037 --> 10:08.404
-Mrs. Sweedler is fine.
-Mrs. Sweedler. Thank you very much.

10:08.574 --> 10:13.841
You see, this tragedy
has affected me in a very...

10:14.013 --> 10:15.571
A very personal way.

10:15.748 --> 10:19.309
-How is that?
-Yes, well, you see...

10:19.485 --> 10:21.453
...the deceased...

10:21.621 --> 10:23.680
...landed on my car.

10:23.856 --> 10:29.590
The splat, as it were, actually
occurred on the roof of my car.

10:29.762 --> 10:33.129
Now, of course,
I can't help but feel that...

10:33.299 --> 10:37.258
...had it been a convertible, this whole
tragedy might have been averted.

10:37.436 --> 10:40.496
But I've never really been
the kind of guy to buy a convertible...

10:40.673 --> 10:43.972
...what with the baldness
and everything.

10:44.577 --> 10:48.035
Well, I have known bald men
who owned convertibles.

10:48.214 --> 10:49.841
They wore a hat.

10:50.016 --> 10:54.715
Yes, but then everything's all
pulled down, and it's... Anyway.

10:54.887 --> 10:58.152
The damage, unfortunately...

10:58.324 --> 11:00.918
...has marred an otherwise
fine automobile...

11:01.093 --> 11:03.857
...rendering it virtually undrivable.

11:04.530 --> 11:06.327
Yes, well, that is a shame.

11:06.499 --> 11:10.367
Yes. A shame.
That is exactly how I would put it.

11:10.536 --> 11:14.996
Now, Mrs. Sweedler, with all
due discretion and sensitivity...

11:15.174 --> 11:18.610
...and taking in the whole scope
of the situation...

11:18.778 --> 11:21.178
...I just can't help but think...

11:21.347 --> 11:25.511
...that the hospital is somehow
responsible for compensating...

11:25.685 --> 11:31.817
...the other still-living victim of this
horrendous, horrendous tragedy.

11:32.491 --> 11:34.254
-Mr. Costanza.
-Yes.

11:34.427 --> 11:38.022
A man plummeted tragically
to his ultimate demise...

11:38.197 --> 11:41.428
-Yes.
... and you greedily, callously...

11:41.600 --> 11:43.761
...want to profit from it?

11:44.103 --> 11:46.230
Well, profit...

11:46.405 --> 11:51.570
I think you'll see from the estimate
that I'm not really profiting that much.

11:52.178 --> 11:54.203
It might be a little high, but...

11:54.380 --> 11:58.248
Get out. Get out now.
Get out of my office!

12:00.886 --> 12:02.877
-Should I just leave..?
-Get out!

12:04.490 --> 12:06.390
This is it.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.496
Wait, excuse me.

12:17.103 --> 12:19.697
What happened to the guy
that was in there before?

12:19.872 --> 12:23.831
-I don't know what you're talking...
-No, you know. He had this:

12:24.777 --> 12:26.176
-He was...
-No.

12:26.345 --> 12:28.006
This doesn't look familiar to you?

12:28.180 --> 12:32.549
-Sir...
-Look, I know what's going on.

12:32.718 --> 12:35.209
The oink, oink.

12:35.387 --> 12:37.514
Yes, if you'll excuse me,
I have some patients...

12:37.690 --> 12:38.987
Listen, you little quack.

12:39.158 --> 12:42.787
There was a half man, half pig in that
room over there. Now, where is he?

12:42.962 --> 12:44.486
-Where is he?!
-Half what?

12:44.663 --> 12:47.564
You know what I mean!
Pork. Sausage.

12:47.733 --> 12:50.099
"That's all, folks."

12:50.770 --> 12:54.672
I think he's been released.

12:56.208 --> 12:57.607
Good.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.211
-He's lying!
-All right, enough of this.

13:00.379 --> 13:03.473
-I gotta go find George.
-All right, you go ahead.

13:03.649 --> 13:05.344
Kramer.

13:11.290 --> 13:13.155
-Where's the mohel?
-He'll be here.

13:13.325 --> 13:15.225
-He's late already.
-Relax.

13:15.394 --> 13:18.056
You'd think you were
getting whacked.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.156
I don't know why he asked me
to be godfather.

13:21.333 --> 13:23.801
We're not close. Because
we're on the softball team...

13:23.969 --> 13:27.132
...I'm pitcher, he's catcher, he thinks
we have a special relationship?

13:27.306 --> 13:29.831
I thought pitchers and catchers
had a special rapport.

13:30.009 --> 13:33.706
Maybe in hardball, with all the signals,
but I'm just lobbing it in.

13:33.879 --> 13:35.107
We don't have conferences.

13:35.281 --> 13:37.806
He doesn't come out to the mound
and encourage me.

13:37.983 --> 13:41.578
What about me? I just watched
a few games with her in the stands.

13:41.754 --> 13:44.848
Don't they have friends? They're
level-jumping on our friendship.

13:45.024 --> 13:47.083
Yes, it is level-jumping.

13:52.598 --> 13:54.566
So...

13:54.733 --> 13:56.200
...you been to a bris before?

13:57.203 --> 13:58.898
No.

13:59.405 --> 14:01.305
I've been to a few of them.

14:02.107 --> 14:06.203
If you start to get woozy later,
which is quite common...

14:06.378 --> 14:09.074
...stay close to me.
I'll get you through it.

14:09.248 --> 14:11.876
I'm a cardiologist. I think I'll manage.

14:14.186 --> 14:15.881
We're not talking about a manicure.

14:16.055 --> 14:18.148
Imagine, this is gonna
be his first memory...

14:18.324 --> 14:21.418
...of his parents just standing there
while some stranger...

14:21.594 --> 14:26.258
...cuts off a piece of his manhood
and then serves a catered lunch.

14:26.432 --> 14:28.764
-Myra?
-She'll be okay.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.901
-Kramer, what's the matter with you?
-Me?

14:32.071 --> 14:34.096
-Oh, that's the mohel.
-He's here.

14:35.574 --> 14:36.802
It's about time.

14:36.976 --> 14:38.204
-Hi.
-Hello.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.072
-Hello, I'm the mohel.
-Oh, hello.

14:40.246 --> 14:42.407
It's very nice to meet you all.

14:42.581 --> 14:44.811
What was that? Jeez,
it scared the hell out of me!

14:44.984 --> 14:48.215
I mean, my God,
I almost had a heart attack!

14:48.387 --> 14:50.912
Okay, I'm fine, I'm fine. Anyway...

14:51.090 --> 14:54.787
...we're here to perform
the mitzvah of the bris.

14:55.761 --> 14:58.389
Is the baby gonna cry like that?
Is that how he cries...

14:58.564 --> 15:02.261
...with that loud, sustained, squealing
cry? That could pose a problem.

15:02.434 --> 15:04.129
Do have any control over your child?

15:04.303 --> 15:07.238
This would be the time to exercise it,
when baby is crying...

15:07.406 --> 15:11.900
...in that high-pitched squealing tone
that can drive you insane!

15:14.613 --> 15:17.275
-Did you find the place all right?
-Did I find it all right?

15:17.449 --> 15:19.314
Could you send me to
a more dangerous area?

15:19.485 --> 15:21.316
I'm dreading walking back
to the subway...

15:21.487 --> 15:23.717
...someone shouldn't smack me
and steal my bag.

15:23.889 --> 15:27.325
Because I'll be lying there, and people
will spit on me and empty my pockets.

15:27.493 --> 15:32.021
I'll be lying in the gutter like a bum,
a dog, a mutt, a mongrel, an animal!

15:32.197 --> 15:34.631
God forbid anybody should
help me or call an ambulance.

15:34.800 --> 15:37.928
That's too much trouble, to pick
up a phone and press a few buttons.

15:38.103 --> 15:40.094
What's the point?

15:41.473 --> 15:43.941
Oh, yeah.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.270
Darling, you see where
that glass is?

15:46.445 --> 15:48.003
See how the glass
is near the edge?

15:48.180 --> 15:50.205
You've got the whole table
to put the glass.

15:50.382 --> 15:55.285
Why you chose the absolute edge so
half the glass is hanging off the table.

15:55.454 --> 15:58.787
You breathe, and it falls over. Then
you've got broken glass on the carpet.

15:58.958 --> 16:03.418
Embedded in the carpet fibers,
deep in the shag, broken glass.

16:03.595 --> 16:05.722
Bits of broken glass
you can never get up.

16:05.898 --> 16:07.229
Can't get it up with a vacuum.

16:07.399 --> 16:09.526
Even on your knees
with a magnifying glass...

16:09.702 --> 16:12.364
...you'll never get all the pieces.
You think you got it.

16:12.538 --> 16:14.301
Two years later, you're barefoot...

16:14.473 --> 16:16.532
...you step on broken glass
and kill yourself!

16:16.709 --> 16:20.236
Is that what you want? I don't think
that's what you want. Do you?

16:25.517 --> 16:28.008
He's very highly recommended,
so...

16:28.387 --> 16:30.252
You're holding the baby?

16:30.422 --> 16:32.515
-No, no.
-Hello. Who's holding the baby?

16:32.691 --> 16:35.421
-Who's holding the baby?!
-Jerry is. Jerry, do you wanna..?

16:35.594 --> 16:37.027
Yeah. I'm holding the baby.

16:37.196 --> 16:40.654
-Okay, go.
-I'm going. All right, I am. I'm going.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.596
-Don't push me.
-Okay, you sit there.

16:42.768 --> 16:44.793
Now I need the baby.
Bring me the baby.

16:44.970 --> 16:47.097
I need the baby!

16:47.740 --> 16:51.699
-No, I'm not gonna let them.
-What are you doing? Come back!

16:53.746 --> 16:57.682
People, people. Compose yourself.
This is a bris!

16:57.850 --> 17:00.341
We're performing a bris here,
not a burlesque show.

17:00.519 --> 17:05.012
This is not a school play. This is not
a baggy-pants farce. This is a bris!

17:05.190 --> 17:06.953
A sacred, ancient ceremony...

17:07.126 --> 17:10.289
...symbolizing the covenant
between God and Abraham.

17:10.462 --> 17:12.362
Or something.

17:13.432 --> 17:16.195
No, don't touch anything.
Don't touch a thing.

17:16.835 --> 17:19.667
I could have been a kosher butcher
like my brother.

17:19.838 --> 17:23.069
The money's good.
It's got a union with benefits.

17:23.242 --> 17:24.868
And cows don't have families.

17:25.044 --> 17:28.137
You make a mistake with a cow,
you move on with your life.

17:29.481 --> 17:31.312
Anyway.

17:37.790 --> 17:40.816
-Hurry up, George. Step on it!
-All right, all right.

17:40.993 --> 17:42.984
That damn mohel!
He circumcised my finger.

17:43.162 --> 17:46.154
-The mohel circumcised my finger.
-You flinched.

17:46.331 --> 17:48.891
Flinched? I did not flinch.
George, did I flinch?

17:49.068 --> 17:52.060
Oh, how would he know?
He blacked out. He fainted.

17:52.237 --> 17:54.000
It was very traumatic.

17:54.173 --> 17:57.233
Last thing I remember was you
flinching. Then everything went black.

17:57.409 --> 17:59.741
Who's got tissues?
I need more tissues.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.846
Look at this thing.
It's my phone finger!

18:02.014 --> 18:05.040
-Careful. You're getting blood all over.
-What about the baby?

18:05.217 --> 18:08.015
The baby's fine. They took him
to the hospital as a precaution.

18:08.187 --> 18:09.882
But look at me.
I'm the one who's hurt!

18:10.055 --> 18:12.819
Will you stop it? You're just
gonna need a few stitches.

18:12.991 --> 18:15.016
A few stitches?
I've never had stitches.

18:15.461 --> 18:17.361
I'll be deformed. I can't live with that.

18:17.529 --> 18:19.394
Goes against my personality.
It's not me.

18:19.565 --> 18:23.023
Hey, look at that.
Boy, are you lucky!

18:23.202 --> 18:25.193
Another great spot
in front of the hospital.

18:25.370 --> 18:28.100
In an emergency yet!
How lucky are you, huh?

18:28.273 --> 18:31.902
Is that unbelievable?
How unbelievable is that, huh?

18:32.077 --> 18:34.307
Come on, give it to me.
Give it to me.

18:36.782 --> 18:39.751
-I've never seen a mohel like that.
-That was a one-in-a-million mohel.

18:39.918 --> 18:41.351
-I said I'm sorry.
-Look at this.

18:41.520 --> 18:45.479
-You'll be okay. I'll see you later, huh?
-Where is he going?

18:46.325 --> 18:48.623
I'm gonna look for a bathroom.

18:50.996 --> 18:52.964
Well, if it isn't Shaky the Mohel.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.862
Nice circumcision, but it's not
supposed to be a finger.

18:56.034 --> 18:58.832
Circumcision was perfect.
That was your fault. You flinched!

18:59.004 --> 19:01.802
Oh, who made you a mohel? You
get your degree from a matchbook?

19:01.974 --> 19:04.033
You see? He flinched again.

19:04.209 --> 19:05.870
Nice. You picked a hell of a mohel!

19:06.044 --> 19:08.672
One more peep, and I'll slice you
like a smoked sturgeon.

19:08.847 --> 19:11.748
-Oh, don't threaten me, butcher boy.
-Butcher boy?

19:11.917 --> 19:13.509
Yeah, what was this?

19:13.685 --> 19:15.516
What was this?
What was this, huh?

19:15.921 --> 19:17.980
Careful, Jerry,
the mohel's got a knife!

19:18.157 --> 19:20.148
Hey, what's going on out here?

19:20.325 --> 19:22.384
You should be ashamed of yourself,
both of you.

19:22.561 --> 19:25.394
-Blood.
-Oh, how's the baby?

19:25.564 --> 19:28.533
-There's nothing wrong with the baby.
-The circumcision went fine.

19:28.700 --> 19:31.965
Thank God the flincher
didn't harm the baby.

19:32.137 --> 19:34.537
I'll get you for this.
This is my business, my life!

19:34.706 --> 19:36.833
No one ruins it for me, no one!

19:37.009 --> 19:38.636
Here's my card.

19:38.810 --> 19:41.210
Get out of my way!

19:53.091 --> 19:54.991
I can't do it.

19:55.160 --> 19:59.790
Look what they did to my boy.
They massacred my boy.

19:59.965 --> 20:05.164
You really do the worst Godfather
I've ever heard. You're not even close.

20:06.638 --> 20:08.606
Oh, that's the flicks.

20:08.774 --> 20:10.742
It's a '76 Chevy Impala.

20:10.909 --> 20:13.571
They stole it right in front
of the hospital.

20:14.012 --> 20:16.810
I saw the guy drive off in it.

20:16.982 --> 20:20.577
Well, he's about 5 feet tall...

20:20.752 --> 20:22.583
...hairless...

20:22.754 --> 20:25.086
...pink complexion.

20:25.257 --> 20:27.691
Looks like a pig.

20:27.859 --> 20:29.759
Yeah, all right, thank you.
Thank you.

20:30.629 --> 20:32.028
Yeah.

20:32.664 --> 20:36.156
So any word from the pig-man?

20:36.335 --> 20:38.235
-No.
-No.

20:38.403 --> 20:41.429
And he's not a pig-man, is he?

20:41.607 --> 20:45.976
No, he's not. He's just
a fat little mental patient.

20:47.512 --> 20:48.774
Myra. Stan.

20:49.181 --> 20:50.978
-Don't touch him.
-What's the matter?

20:51.149 --> 20:54.277
You're out, Jerry. Out as godfather.
You too, Elaine. You're both out.

20:54.453 --> 20:58.116
-But I didn't do any...
-No buts. We've made up our minds.

20:58.790 --> 21:02.920
We want Kramer. He showed us
how much he cares about Steven.

21:05.597 --> 21:08.896
Don't ever go against the family,
Jerry.

21:14.973 --> 21:16.531
Godfather.

21:16.708 --> 21:19.199
-Godfather.
-Yes.

21:34.293 --> 21:37.751
To me, what's really amazing, that for
every job that there is in the world...

21:37.929 --> 21:39.794
...there's someone willing to do it.

21:39.965 --> 21:42.729
Someone goes, "I will stand in
the tunnel breathing exhaust...

21:42.901 --> 21:45.699
...watching the cars go by,
making sure everything's okay."

21:45.871 --> 21:49.932
Someone goes, "I will work behind
the elephant with the big shovel."

21:50.108 --> 21:52.440
Doctors go, "Yes, I will
confine myself...

21:52.611 --> 21:55.739
...to one particularly objectionable
part of the human body...

21:55.914 --> 22:00.283
...all day, every day. I will do it."

22:00.519 --> 22:04.580
I think people that are unemployed
are not really unable to find work...

22:04.756 --> 22:06.621
...they're just easily disgusted.

22:06.792 --> 22:09.920
"Yes, I'm starving, and my family
has no clothing or shelter...

22:10.095 --> 22:12.620
...but I'm not cleaning that up."
