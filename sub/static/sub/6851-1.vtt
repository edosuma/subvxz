[ Baby
Gurgles ]

01:36:04.041 --> 01:36:05.250
SYLVIA.

01:36:05.250 --> 01:36:07.750
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT ?
WE THOUGHT YOU'D GONE.

01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:10.625
I COULDN'T GO, JACK.
I COULDN'T DO IT.

01:36:10.625 --> 01:36:13.083
I DON'T WANT TO
MAKE ANOTHER MISTAKE.

01:36:13.083 --> 01:36:16.542
I KNEW IF I TOOK HER,
I'D BE MAKING ANOTHER MISTAKE.

01:36:16.542 --> 01:36:18.917
I HAVE TO WORK...

01:36:18.917 --> 01:36:22.291
AND I CAN'T DO THAT AND
TAKE CARE OF MARY ALONE.

01:36:22.291 --> 01:36:24.417
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT'S IT'S LIKE ?

01:36:24.417 --> 01:36:27.375
A ONE-ROOM FLAT,
ON YOUR FEET ALL DAY,

01:36:27.375 --> 01:36:29.875
WORKING OR
AUDITIONING.

01:36:29.875 --> 01:36:32.375
I'M ON THE JOB SOMETIMES
UNTIL 3 IN THE MORNING.

01:36:32.375 --> 01:36:36.959
SINCE MARY GETS UP AT 5:30,
I DON'T GET MUCH SLEEP.

01:36:36.959 --> 01:36:40.333
AND AFTER 5:30,
IT STARTS OVER AT 9:00.

01:36:40.333 --> 01:36:43.542
BY THE TIME I CHANGE HER AND
PLAY WITH HER, IT'S 8:00.

01:36:43.542 --> 01:36:45.083
FORGET ABOUT
SLEEP AFTER THAT.

01:36:45.083 --> 01:36:48.709
WITH BABY-SITTERS, ALL MY MONEY
IS SUCKED DOWN THE TUBES.

01:36:48.709 --> 01:36:51.583
AND ME SO TIRED, I CAN'T
TAKE MARY TO THE PARK.

01:36:51.583 --> 01:36:54.083
GETTING TIME FOR
THE PARK IS A BITCH !

01:36:54.083 --> 01:36:57.166
I MEAN, I LOVE
MY JOB BUT,

01:36:57.166 --> 01:37:01.041
I SOMETIMES FEEL LIKE I'M JUST
WORKING TO PAY THE SITTERS ...

01:37:01.041 --> 01:37:03.250
AND I RUN
AROUND ALL DAY,

01:37:03.250 --> 01:37:05.291
AND I DON'T
GET ENOUGH SLEEP.

01:37:05.291 --> 01:37:07.041
[ Baby Cries ]

01:37:07.041 --> 01:37:09.583
I DON'T THINK I'M TAKING
VERY GOOD CARE OF MARY.

01:37:09.583 --> 01:37:12.250
- OF COURSE YOU ARE.
- I AM ?

01:37:12.250 --> 01:37:14.542
WE KNOW HOW
HARD IT IS.

01:37:14.542 --> 01:37:16.750
THE 3 OF US COULD
HARDLY MANAGE.

01:37:16.750 --> 01:37:19.542
I DON'T WANT
TO GO TO LONDON.

01:37:19.542 --> 01:37:21.458
I WANT TO WORK
IN NEW YORK.

01:37:21.458 --> 01:37:24.458
BUT I CAN'T
DO THAT ALONE.

01:37:24.458 --> 01:37:26.625
I HOPE I DON'T HAVE TO.

01:37:26.625 --> 01:37:31.291
I NEED HELP.
I NEED
SOMEONE TO HELP ME.

01:37:31.291 --> 01:37:33.291
WE'LL HELP.
WE WILL HELP !

01:37:33.291 --> 01:37:36.291
YOU CAN LEAVE HER
ANYTIME YOU WANT.

01:37:36.291 --> 01:37:38.792
WHEN YOU GO FOR AN
AUDITION OR SHOPPING,

01:37:38.792 --> 01:37:41.417
OR YOU WANT TO
BE BY YOURSELF.

01:37:41.417 --> 01:37:43.750
I HOPED YOU'D
SAY THAT.

01:37:43.750 --> 01:37:46.625
REALLY ?
THANK YOU,
SO MUCH !

01:37:46.625 --> 01:37:47.792
OF COURSE !

01:37:47.792 --> 01:37:49.625
HOLD IT, GUYS.

01:37:49.625 --> 01:37:51.709
I DON'T LIKE
THIS ARRANGEMENT.

01:37:51.709 --> 01:37:55.291
I JUST DON'T WANT TO
BE MARY'S BABY-SITTER.

01:37:55.291 --> 01:38:00.125
I WANT -- WE  WANT TO BE ABLE
TO SEE HER ALL THE TIME.

01:38:00.125 --> 01:38:02.500
I AGREE, SO WHAT ARE YOU
SAYING ?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:05.583
I'M SAYING,
THAT I THINK,

01:38:05.583 --> 01:38:08.875
MARY SHOULD MOVE IN
WITH US PERMANENTLY,

01:38:08.875 --> 01:38:11.166
THAT WE SHOULD
BE HER FAMILY.

01:38:11.166 --> 01:38:16.000
IT'S LOVELY OF YOU TO OFFER ...
BUT I COULDN'T LET MARY --

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.291
NO, NO, NO, NO --

01:38:18.291 --> 01:38:20.166
YOU'RE RIGHT.
SHE'S YOUR DAUGHTER.

01:38:20.166 --> 01:38:23.208
SHE NEEDS A FULL-TIME MOTHER.
THAT'S WHY ...

01:38:23.208 --> 01:38:26.583
WE THINK THAT YOU
SHOULD MOVE IN, TOO.

01:38:26.583 --> 01:38:28.333
IT'S A
GREAT IDEA !
YEAH !

01:38:28.333 --> 01:38:30.542
OH SYLVIA,
COME ON.
4 IS BETTER
THAN 3.

01:38:30.542 --> 01:38:33.500
UH, DO YOU
HAVE ROOM ?

01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:35.959
I'LL BUILD YOU
AND MARY ROOMS.

01:38:35.959 --> 01:38:39.333
YEAH, HE
BUILDS ROOMS !
