00:07.717 --> 00:17.558
(opera singing)

00:17.768 --> 00:27.609
(opera singing)

00:27.820 --> 00:45.455
(opera singing)

00:45.671 --> 00:47.878
(clapping)

00:48.090 --> 00:54.928
Brava! Brava! Bravissima!

01:09.445 --> 01:12.278
(humming)

01:24.627 --> 01:25.582
(whistle blowing)

01:25.795 --> 01:27.751
Ahh! Ahh!

01:40.685 --> 01:43.176
Dear K, | GZG.

01:43.396 --> 01:45.637
Go Hans Solo and all that.

01:45.856 --> 01:49.189
I don't know howl know I
gotta do this, but YOLO, right?

01:49.402 --> 01:51.358
Holla at you soon, Tam-Tam.

01:51.570 --> 01:53.902
Hmmm... kids they're
as cryptic as...

01:54.115 --> 01:55.855
a witness signature
on a Dark contract?

01:56.075 --> 01:57.611
Tam-Tam's just
following her heart.

01:57.827 --> 01:58.532
And I wonder...

01:58.744 --> 02:00.450
Now, | just have
a big hole in mine.

02:00.663 --> 02:02.494
Can you really know
yourself without memory?

02:02.707 --> 02:03.913
I mean can you really
know what you want?

02:04.125 --> 02:04.910
| just hope she's safe.

02:05.126 --> 02:05.990
Freedom and a whole
lot of boom-boom.

02:06.210 --> 02:08.075
Oh god, it is so
good to finally dish.

02:08.296 --> 02:09.331
I know, I don't know
what I would do without you.

02:09.547 --> 02:10.707
Me, too.

02:11.299 --> 02:16.339
(shallow breathing)

02:16.554 --> 02:17.634
Hey, you okay?

02:17.847 --> 02:18.632
Come on--

02:18.848 --> 02:19.462
You got her?

02:19.682 --> 02:21.343
Yeah, yeah. Sit down.

02:24.812 --> 02:30.728
Ah-ah-ah! Toll for being
not-helping douche-balls!

02:30.943 --> 02:32.604
Water, honey. Water.

02:35.239 --> 02:37.150
You...

02:37.366 --> 02:39.527
(speaking Russian)

02:39.744 --> 02:41.200
Whoa, she's Russian. Sweet!

02:41.412 --> 02:43.494
(speaking Russian)

02:43.706 --> 02:45.071
Uh, a little help here, Kenz.

02:45.291 --> 02:47.247
(speaking Russian)

02:47.460 --> 02:50.543
Uh, "I can't believe I found
you. I found you! I found you!"

02:50.755 --> 02:52.916
Uh, she found you
is the primary message.

02:53.132 --> 02:55.919
I've never seen
her before in my life.

02:56.135 --> 03:01.095
(speaking Russian)

03:01.307 --> 03:04.595
"I came. I came, I came, I
came just like she told me to."

03:04.810 --> 03:07.096
Who? Who told you to come?

03:07.313 --> 03:10.100
You. You did.

03:15.321 --> 03:18.063
Life is hard when you
don 't know who you are.

03:18.282 --> 03:21.024
It's harder when you
don 't know what you are.

03:21.243 --> 03:23.905
My love carries
a death sentence.

03:24.121 --> 03:28.956
I was lost for years,
searching while hiding.

03:29.168 --> 03:33.127
Only to find that I belong
to a world hidden from humans.

03:33.339 --> 03:34.875
I won 't hide anymore.

03:35.091 --> 03:38.083
I will live the life I choose.

04:08.666 --> 04:12.204
Bo-- I told you.
lanka needs to rest.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.752
Trick, some woman I don't
know and never talked to

04:14.964 --> 04:18.081
said I told her to come see me.
I don't know if I believe her,

04:18.300 --> 04:21.087
or what to believe anymore,
but I need to talk to her.

04:21.303 --> 04:22.463
Pretty please.

04:22.680 --> 04:26.593
She needs to heal. She's an
Alkonost, a very rare and

04:26.809 --> 04:29.016
delicate descendant
of bird people.

04:29.228 --> 04:29.808
And running in the cold

04:30.020 --> 04:31.635
may have strained
her vocal chords.

04:31.856 --> 04:34.063
Let me guess? Singing
is how she feeds.

04:34.275 --> 04:37.813
The Alkonost's songs
evokes powerful memories.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.564
Wait-- What kind of memories?

04:39.780 --> 04:43.568
Some good, some bad.
Their songs can even

04:43.784 --> 04:47.618
take life. Including their
own if they're not careful.

04:47.830 --> 04:50.412
Just let her rest for now.

04:50.624 --> 04:54.412
Well, when Liza Fae-nelli
wakes up, let me know.

05:07.766 --> 05:11.099
You would have killed at
Studio 54. Just like I killed

05:11.312 --> 05:15.271
the busboy who served
me tonic instead of soda.

05:15.483 --> 05:16.643
What do you want?

05:16.859 --> 05:19.225
Well, I thought I'd come
over and help you move, but

05:19.445 --> 05:22.232
clearly we have something
more pressing to work on.

05:24.283 --> 05:29.823
Your hostessing skills,
they suck ass, disco queen.

05:30.039 --> 05:32.576
Well, |-|-- (laughing)

05:32.791 --> 05:34.577
I didn't really expect
The Morrigan just to--

05:34.793 --> 05:35.578
(chuckling)

05:35.794 --> 05:38.752
show up with...
pizza and beer.

05:38.964 --> 05:41.125
Well, it's not a moving
day party without some

05:41.342 --> 05:46.678
'za, and a little something from
my own personal microbrewery.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.472
Oh, wow. "Dark Belch."

05:50.684 --> 05:52.640
l was going through
a redneck phase.

05:52.853 --> 05:56.641
They were delicious,
so... No regrets.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.769
And please, if we're going
to be working together,

05:59.985 --> 06:02.237
call me Evony.

06:02.446 --> 06:04.937
Oh, oh, careful! Careful.

06:05.157 --> 06:07.364
Ha ha... Jeez...
What's in there?

06:07.576 --> 06:10.943
lt's, um, my, uh... entire
Star Trek DVD collection. Yeah.

06:11.163 --> 06:15.247
Enterprise, Voyager,
Next Generation. The movies.

06:15.459 --> 06:20.294
My... con collectible
action figures.

06:20.506 --> 06:25.751
Oh, honey... I obviously
came just in time.

06:36.772 --> 06:38.387
The prodigal wolf returns.

06:38.607 --> 06:39.722
Rode for two days straight.

06:39.942 --> 06:41.853
Yeah, that's what I said.

06:42.069 --> 06:42.728
Bo--

06:42.945 --> 06:45.152
Dyson--

06:45.364 --> 06:47.480
Well, that's not good news.

06:48.367 --> 06:49.948
|t's Lauren.

06:51.954 --> 06:54.912
Looks like she has
gone with the Dark.

06:55.124 --> 06:59.709
Oh, well, yeah.
You're gonna giggle.

06:59.920 --> 07:08.715
Really, you are, but
as it turns out, so did I.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.420
What? Why?

07:11.640 --> 07:13.881
My hand was forced, okay?

07:14.101 --> 07:19.186
By The Wanderer, or Rainer,
or-- whoever the bastard is.

07:19.398 --> 07:25.109
We can fix this. I promise. I
think I know where we can start.

07:25.321 --> 07:27.937
Yeah... so do |.

07:31.577 --> 07:37.413
Bo-- You're Dark.
I'm Light. We can't.

07:37.625 --> 07:38.660
Do you understand?
It's forbidden.

07:38.876 --> 07:40.036
Good.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.343
You like that?

07:51.555 --> 07:53.056
It's different.

07:53.265 --> 07:57.634
I said... Do you like that?

07:57.853 --> 08:00.219
|'|| learn.

08:00.439 --> 08:02.395
Oxidated water
is good for vocals.

08:02.608 --> 08:04.064
Or, is it un-oxidated--

08:04.276 --> 08:06.437
Balls of minotaur!

08:08.155 --> 08:12.114
What's wrong with you two?
Light and Dark can't fraternize!

08:12.326 --> 08:13.736
Dyson!

08:13.952 --> 08:17.410
I know. I know.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.576
The Una Mens are everywhere.

08:23.337 --> 08:26.295
No. You get your brains
out of each other's pants,

08:26.507 --> 08:28.668
and get out
of my barrel room.

08:29.635 --> 08:33.423
lanka's awake. Try
not to aggravate her.

08:33.639 --> 08:33.968
She's very--

08:34.181 --> 08:35.136
delicate.

08:35.349 --> 08:37.965
Yes. I know.

08:47.653 --> 08:48.893
lanka--

08:49.113 --> 08:52.901
Oh! My hero. I'm so
happy I found you!

08:53.117 --> 08:55.733
I did not think it would
happen, but here you are.

08:55.953 --> 08:57.739
And here I am.

08:57.955 --> 09:00.367
Well, I'm glad
you're okay, but--

09:00.582 --> 09:01.742
What are you talking about?

09:03.627 --> 09:07.996
No, bu-- You came to see
me after I sang for you.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.251
And it touched you so deeply.

09:10.467 --> 09:12.082
When did you
sing for me? Where?

09:12.302 --> 09:17.672
It was at Th-- The...
You made me promise.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.222
What did I make you promise?

09:19.435 --> 09:21.300
That I would come
here and find you.

09:21.520 --> 09:25.183
I said, "No, Bo, I
can't, it's impossible."

09:25.399 --> 09:30.860
But, you insisted I escape.
You gave me such inspiration.

09:32.865 --> 09:37.450
I don't understand. I'm sorry,
I just don't know what to say.

09:37.661 --> 09:39.902
Just listen.

09:40.122 --> 09:49.918
(opera singing)

09:50.132 --> 09:59.973
(opera singing)

10:00.184 --> 10:07.056
(opera singing)

10:07.274 --> 10:09.185
What the hell...

10:11.278 --> 10:14.065
It was a good memory?

10:14.281 --> 10:18.149
It was, um... vague.

10:18.368 --> 10:22.611
And weird. But it was
a clue, a real clue.

10:22.831 --> 10:24.742
Please, lanka, sing more.

10:24.958 --> 10:30.123
No. We shook on it.
I sing for you

10:30.339 --> 10:33.251
and you get me what I
want most in the world.

10:33.467 --> 10:34.422
Which is?

10:34.635 --> 10:36.216
Freedom.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.389
lanka, you can't hold
my memories hostage.

10:46.605 --> 10:49.392
No, I do not have your memories.
Only you have your memories.

10:49.608 --> 10:51.519
| only have the
key to unlock them.

10:51.735 --> 10:53.851
You should probably
give me this key.

10:54.071 --> 10:57.563
Oh-- People talk
about the Succubus,

10:57.783 --> 10:59.944
and they say you
are different, but you

11:00.160 --> 11:03.402
are just like the others.
You promise me my wings

11:03.622 --> 11:06.409
and then you pluck my feathers
so you can hear me sing.

11:06.625 --> 11:11.335
I'm sorry. Lately, I've
just been feeling so lost.

11:11.547 --> 11:13.128
Wait-- What others?

11:13.340 --> 11:16.503
I sing for a wealthy
and powerful Buraq.

11:16.718 --> 11:23.055
Him, and only him. But I
am starving. I cannot feed.

11:23.267 --> 11:25.929
If only I could
sing for an audience.

11:26.144 --> 11:29.432
If only I could
sing my Famous Aria.

11:30.774 --> 11:33.356
I guess I'm more of a Black
Eyed Peas kind of girl.

11:33.569 --> 11:37.153
"Ni Regrette Du PassÃ©
Ni Perdu De L'Avenir."

11:37.364 --> 11:40.231
Hm? It means,

11:40.450 --> 11:45.615
"Neither regret the
past nor fear the future."

11:45.831 --> 11:47.787
Well, it's beautiful.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.911
But, it doesn't
mean anything to me.

11:53.463 --> 11:57.297
You, you said you
would not remember.

11:57.509 --> 12:00.797
Please, uh, look in
your knife. The handle...

12:18.530 --> 12:23.570
"lanka, you will sing for me,
and I will bring you freedom."

12:23.785 --> 12:25.491
That's my handwriting.

12:25.704 --> 12:27.285
lanka!

12:28.332 --> 12:30.744
Oh, no. Please,
Bo, help me. It's him.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.074
Who him?

12:32.294 --> 12:34.501
lanka! lanka!

12:34.713 --> 12:36.499
Who is the owner of
this establishment?!

12:36.715 --> 12:38.626
Where is my lanka?
The poor thing!

12:38.842 --> 12:42.630
Hey! She's not a thing,
pal. And nobody owns her.

12:42.846 --> 12:45.337
That is not true.
The beautiful lanka has

12:45.557 --> 12:47.639
been in my family
for centuries.

12:47.851 --> 12:50.888
Yeah, well, four score and
a bunch of years ago, Lincoln

12:51.104 --> 12:54.892
threw down and slavery went the
way of the Dodo. So, let her go.

12:55.108 --> 13:00.102
Surely, you jest.
Bring her to me. Now.

13:00.322 --> 13:03.906
Sorry. lanka left
ten minutes ago.

13:04.117 --> 13:08.201
No, she didn't. She's here.

13:08.413 --> 13:09.744
You put a GPS on her?

13:09.957 --> 13:12.494
What is she? A dog
with a chip in her ear?

13:12.709 --> 13:15.086
Don't be ridiculous. The
device is in her necklace.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.580
Then I'll rip it off her.

13:16.797 --> 13:21.131
Try it. And you'll only
tighten it around her throat.

13:23.345 --> 13:27.463
All she wants is to
sing the Famous Aria.

13:27.683 --> 13:30.720
And all I ask is
that you allow it.

13:30.936 --> 13:35.896
The Famous Aria...
wasted on the masses.

13:36.108 --> 13:37.814
Now, you're
just insulting me.

13:38.026 --> 13:43.111
People speak of your
generosity. Your benevolence.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.359
Well, I am both.

13:45.575 --> 13:49.318
Well, when the public finds
out that you deprived them

13:49.538 --> 13:55.499
of a performance by lanka,
they'll see who you truly are.

13:55.711 --> 14:01.331
Wait now-- I simply
hadn't made up my mind.

14:01.550 --> 14:05.714
I will allow it. But, I need
a private room, a bottle

14:05.929 --> 14:12.801
of Scapa 25 single malt, and
a place to sit that's not so...

14:13.020 --> 14:14.851
sticky.

14:16.356 --> 14:19.439
I can do less sticky.

14:20.569 --> 14:23.561
The personal and
professional journals of

14:23.780 --> 14:30.777
Charles Mayo, Albert
Einstein, and Marie Curie? How?

14:30.996 --> 14:33.578
Marie turned out to be a real
axe wound, so I stole her diary

14:33.790 --> 14:37.123
as a joke. Mayo's I dug
up from under Jimmy Hoffa and

14:37.335 --> 14:40.418
Einstein's? Picked that
up at a garage sale.

14:41.923 --> 14:43.663
You go to garage sales?

14:43.884 --> 14:44.999
Mmhmm.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.129
You wouldn't believe the
shit that humans will sell

14:47.345 --> 14:51.008
for a few sawbucks. My Van
Gogh, my Stradivarius, two

14:51.224 --> 14:56.594
Faberge eggs. Gustav Faberge
would lose his shit if he knew.

14:56.813 --> 15:01.728
They were Fae? Are all
these journals from the Fae?

15:13.622 --> 15:15.908
There's hundreds
more in the archives.

15:19.044 --> 15:20.875
Oh...

15:23.924 --> 15:27.382
"July 30, 1830..."

15:27.594 --> 15:30.131
"Patient O'Connor, who was
previously and successfully

15:30.347 --> 15:33.555
injected with
tuberculosis bacilli

15:33.767 --> 15:38.056
took a turn last
night and died."

15:38.271 --> 15:40.933
This doctor was
experimenting on humans.

15:41.149 --> 15:43.390
That's typical
Dark Fae callousness.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.316
Oh, the hubris of your kind.

15:45.529 --> 15:48.396
That doctor was not Fae.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.571
Oh. Well..

15:50.784 --> 15:53.116
although, I am very proud
of my profession, I haven't

15:53.328 --> 15:55.740
always agreed with the
methods of my forefathers.

15:55.956 --> 15:57.071
Why not?

15:57.290 --> 16:02.284
Anticoagulants, flu
vaccines, basic anatomy.

16:02.504 --> 16:04.119
You know, medicine
and treatment meant for

16:04.339 --> 16:09.049
humans is best
researched on humans.

16:09.261 --> 16:11.968
Wow. (laughing) Wow.

16:12.180 --> 16:15.547
I mean, could your theories
be any more outdated?

16:15.767 --> 16:18.383
We actually use computers
now to navigate diseases

16:18.603 --> 16:23.939
and help find cures. We can
grow organs, tissue samples--

16:24.151 --> 16:27.643
Oh, oh, compromise.
We can clone somebody

16:27.863 --> 16:29.819
and experiment on them.

16:30.031 --> 16:34.240
No. It's disgusting. I won't
do it and you can't make me.

16:34.452 --> 16:37.740
Lauren, calm down.
Have a drink.

16:41.126 --> 16:43.742
Look, you don't have to

16:43.962 --> 16:47.295
do anything that
you don't want to.

16:47.507 --> 16:52.251
But, I want you to feel free.

16:52.470 --> 16:55.928
Oh, okay, and morals? Ethics?

16:56.141 --> 16:59.975
Overrated. But, if
they're important to you,

17:00.187 --> 17:02.519
I can respect that.

17:04.774 --> 17:09.063
If I agree to work
with the Dark Fae,

17:09.279 --> 17:11.816
it will have to
be on my own terms.

17:12.032 --> 17:15.991
Fine. Right. Scouts honour.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.361
Kenzi, you need
to get out of here.

17:19.581 --> 17:21.537
An Alkonost's song
can hurt humans.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.786
After nearly four years
of your nerve-shredding

17:24.002 --> 17:27.665
fiddle-dee-pluck-me-holy-
clover-shoot-me-in-the-face music--

17:27.881 --> 17:29.417
I think I can handle it.

17:29.633 --> 17:33.296
Kenzi... you really should go.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.594
I'm not going anywhere.

17:43.355 --> 17:45.391
I am so sorry, but
I am your biggest fan--

17:45.607 --> 17:50.943
Oh! Ah! Ah! Oh,
my god! How are you?

17:51.154 --> 17:51.904
How are you?

17:52.113 --> 17:52.977
I'm good!

17:53.198 --> 17:54.187
What are you doing here?

17:54.407 --> 17:57.149
So, she's famous and
beautiful and Russian.

17:57.369 --> 17:59.405
She's also obnoxious
and vain and stuck up--

17:59.621 --> 18:01.236
And did you know
that "singer" in

18:01.456 --> 18:04.573
Russian actually means
"whore?" Except it doesn't...

18:04.793 --> 18:06.078
Are you listening to me?

18:06.294 --> 18:09.786
She is the key, Kenz. To my
memories, to finding Rainer,

18:10.006 --> 18:12.122
and who knows what else.

18:21.101 --> 18:30.942
(opera music playing)

18:31.152 --> 18:40.993
(opera music playing)

18:41.204 --> 18:45.948
(opera music playing)

18:46.167 --> 18:49.751
(clanging)

18:49.963 --> 18:55.253
A train... I'm on a train.

18:55.468 --> 18:58.585
I can almost see his face...

19:02.267 --> 19:04.724
So sorry for the
interruption, folks,

19:04.936 --> 19:07.678
but this prized songstress
of yours is wired to blow.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.888
If you don't do
exactly as I say,

19:10.108 --> 19:13.066
the little bird goes kaboom.

19:13.278 --> 19:15.985
Looks like it's our
turn to take centre stage.

19:16.197 --> 19:18.153
Somebody just crossed
the wrong diva.

19:20.660 --> 19:26.621
If anyone here has a death wish,
by all means try and stop me.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.040
It's lanka's necklace,
the crystals.

19:29.252 --> 19:31.789
One music fan puts a
GPS in it and the other--

19:32.005 --> 19:33.415
Programs it to
explode. Correct.

19:33.631 --> 19:35.462
Who are you and
what do you want?

19:35.675 --> 19:39.714
He is Marcus, a
Camazotz Mayan Bat Warrior.

19:39.929 --> 19:41.339
And he's come for lanka.

19:41.556 --> 19:43.842
Just like you did
all those years ago.

19:44.059 --> 19:45.390
And I got her, didn't I?

19:45.602 --> 19:48.844
Uh huh... And I
stole her back.

19:49.064 --> 19:50.645
Do you wish to
start another war?!

19:50.857 --> 19:55.476
It is you who wishes
to fight. In all Camazotz,

19:55.695 --> 19:59.654
lanka evokes memories
of battles waged and won.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.822
It bolsters their armies.

20:02.035 --> 20:04.151
And I say yes to
your provocation.

20:04.371 --> 20:09.661
One word to my fellow Baraqians,
and we shall rain fire on you!

20:09.876 --> 20:10.956
No!

20:11.169 --> 20:14.753
Unrest of any kind will
bring unwanted attention

20:14.964 --> 20:16.545
from the Una Mens.

20:23.014 --> 20:24.515
The Famous Aria
has weakened her.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.966
This is too much.

20:28.186 --> 20:30.848
Moving an Alkonost when she
is weak is a death sentence.

20:31.064 --> 20:35.398
You want lanka alive? You
need to let her rest, Marcus.

20:42.158 --> 20:44.149
This will help her
regain her strength.

20:44.369 --> 20:46.906
Yeah, and give us a chance
to look at those crystals.

20:47.122 --> 20:48.532
They're not crystals.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.488
They're Atlantean Quartz.

20:50.708 --> 20:53.450
Once thought to ignite
volcanic eruptions.

20:53.670 --> 20:54.830
Oh.

20:55.046 --> 20:57.913
When Marcus said kaboom,
he really meant it.

20:59.426 --> 21:02.759
So, how do we stop this?

21:02.971 --> 21:04.836
The Quartz needs to be frozen.

21:05.056 --> 21:07.889
But only liquid volcanic
argon will do the trick.

21:08.101 --> 21:10.638
No biggie, I'll send
Kenzi to the tunnels.

21:10.854 --> 21:11.969
To where?

21:12.188 --> 21:14.804
The liquid
volcanic argon store.

21:15.024 --> 21:16.400
(laughing)

21:16.609 --> 21:17.598
Okay, do it again!

21:17.819 --> 21:19.935
Okay, okay, okay!

21:20.155 --> 21:23.739
Doctor's log, stardate 4365.3,
sitting on couch with Evony,

21:23.950 --> 21:28.535
aka The Morrigan, who
seems suspiciously human.

21:28.746 --> 21:30.998
Why? Because I have feelings?

21:31.207 --> 21:33.198
Oh, I don't know. Empathy
and compassion are two

21:33.418 --> 21:36.706
words I would not
usually associate with you.

21:36.921 --> 21:39.913
My god, I think I'm
tipsy. I've had one beer.

21:40.133 --> 21:42.590
Twenty-five percent alcohol?!
Are you kidding me?

21:42.802 --> 21:43.461
(laughing)

21:43.678 --> 21:44.667
Ahem.

21:44.888 --> 21:46.594
Hi! Alternate reality Lauren.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.183
I'd like to talk
to the real Lauren,

21:49.392 --> 21:51.633
so please go
get her. Thank you.

21:51.853 --> 21:52.387
Belch?

21:58.568 --> 22:01.685
Well, you're getting
your colour back.

22:01.905 --> 22:09.073
Oh, it's so good to see a
face from the past. Your face.

22:10.788 --> 22:12.324
Remember the pranks
we used to play in

22:12.540 --> 22:14.371
Bambra's amphitheatre
after dark?

22:14.584 --> 22:19.294
In the um, near the...
How did you call it?

22:19.506 --> 22:21.462
Space rock?

22:22.842 --> 22:25.754
Sonic meteorite. Yeah.

22:25.970 --> 22:29.633
I would dial the tone--
beep, boop, bap!

22:29.849 --> 22:30.929
And do you remember
what you would ask?

22:31.142 --> 22:34.680
Ah, yes. Is your
refrigerator on?

22:34.896 --> 22:36.511
And they say yes, and I say,

22:36.731 --> 22:38.312
"then you better
go and catch it."

22:38.525 --> 22:40.390
(laughing)

22:40.610 --> 22:42.316
You mess the joke
up every time.

22:42.529 --> 22:49.526
Oh, you make fun. But...
you make me smile.

22:53.665 --> 22:58.375
Oh... Thank you.
For the visit.

22:58.586 --> 23:00.998
But, I must lie down.

23:01.214 --> 23:02.545
Of course.

23:31.035 --> 23:32.571
Okay, explain
this to me again.

23:32.787 --> 23:34.118
You and Bo need liquid argon

23:34.330 --> 23:36.321
to add to the barrels
of your homemade merlot

23:36.541 --> 23:38.623
in order to avoid oxidation?

23:38.835 --> 23:39.494
Yup!

23:39.711 --> 23:40.621
Yeah, nothing to worry about.

23:40.837 --> 23:41.952
It's just our new thing.

23:42.171 --> 23:44.662
You know, a good
old home hooch.

23:44.882 --> 23:47.043
Looks like you got
something new, too.

23:47.260 --> 23:48.625
You guys, like,
moving in together?

23:48.845 --> 23:51.052
No, we're just talking,
and since this place belongs

23:51.264 --> 23:52.800
to the Light,
Evony helped me find

23:53.016 --> 23:54.881
a great new
loft in the city.

23:55.101 --> 23:56.386
Evony. Hm. Wow. Weird.

23:56.603 --> 23:57.388
(sniff)

23:57.604 --> 23:59.435
This doesn't smell
like Kool-Aid.

24:01.149 --> 24:02.264
How's Bo?

24:02.483 --> 24:03.438
Good.

24:03.651 --> 24:04.811
You know, uh, black
smoke and gargoyles and

24:05.028 --> 24:07.519
crystal clear Atlantean
Quartz, the usual.

24:07.739 --> 24:12.859
But, she, uh...
she misses you. We all do.

24:13.077 --> 24:14.032
Wait--

24:14.245 --> 24:17.863
Did you say clear
Atlantean Quartz?

24:21.961 --> 24:23.872
Stay back.

24:24.088 --> 24:25.999
You don't really
want to harm lanka.

24:26.215 --> 24:26.715
Do you?

24:26.924 --> 24:29.791
I want what I want.

24:30.011 --> 24:33.344
Well, maybe if you tell us what
that is, we can help you out.

24:33.556 --> 24:35.421
I can't say, but if
achieving it means

24:35.642 --> 24:39.134
blowing up
Bamber's prize bird--

24:39.354 --> 24:41.310
Then yes, I will harm her.

24:41.522 --> 24:42.511
You know, it's a weak
man who keeps a bar

24:42.732 --> 24:45.314
full of innocent hostages.

24:45.526 --> 24:46.652
You leave.

24:46.861 --> 24:48.317
Not on your life.

24:48.529 --> 24:51.316
And especially not on hers.

24:53.868 --> 24:55.483
Now.

24:55.703 --> 24:57.989
Little men and
their little toys.

24:59.582 --> 25:02.415
I'll be upstairs. I won't
let anything happen to you.

25:25.608 --> 25:26.688
Mission accomplished?

25:26.901 --> 25:28.892
Bamber's transmitter,
as promised.

25:29.112 --> 25:30.318
Will it work?

25:30.530 --> 25:31.394
Like a charm.

25:31.614 --> 25:33.195
You are now looking
at a receiver,

25:33.408 --> 25:36.650
compliments of my
days with the S.|.S.

25:36.869 --> 25:39.155
Please, you must...

25:39.372 --> 25:41.363
I can't.

25:41.582 --> 25:43.538
And you will be--

25:43.751 --> 25:45.332
Bamber will come after...

25:45.545 --> 25:46.830
Speak his name.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.035
(radio interference)

25:48.256 --> 25:50.747
Someone's listening to us.

25:50.967 --> 25:51.672
It's over.

25:51.884 --> 25:54.216
Don't say that!

25:54.429 --> 25:55.885
I'm sorry, lanka.

25:56.097 --> 25:58.383
Please, Marcus, no!

25:58.599 --> 26:02.342
(beeping)

26:02.562 --> 26:05.554
The detonator.
He pressed it.

26:07.692 --> 26:09.853
Everybody get down!

26:14.741 --> 26:16.527
Bo, what's happening?
What'd I miss?

26:16.743 --> 26:18.699
Oh, and I have to
tell you something.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.617
The Quartz didn't detonate.

26:20.830 --> 26:22.866
Of course not. There's
no fire in it anymore.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.162
It's dead, done, a fake.

26:24.375 --> 26:25.706
You know, like
the Mayan apocalypse.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.203
God, what a rip that was.

26:27.420 --> 26:29.331
Come on--

26:31.048 --> 26:33.585
Oh, okay. The
transparency of the

26:33.801 --> 26:35.757
necklace proves
it's involatility.

26:35.970 --> 26:37.335
Now you're telling me?

26:37.555 --> 26:39.011
Channeling Dr. Lauren.

26:39.223 --> 26:41.885
Oh, yeah, right. How is she?

26:42.101 --> 26:45.218
Good! Good, yeah, you
know, in a general, uh...

26:45.438 --> 26:47.554
alone sense. Btdubs,
have you seen Hale?

26:47.774 --> 26:48.729
Hale?

26:48.941 --> 26:49.851
Yeah.

26:50.067 --> 26:54.060
He's... you know,
around. Probably.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.020
I think I'm going
to go find him.

26:56.240 --> 26:58.231
Okay.

27:00.995 --> 27:03.031
lanka's gone.
Her and Marcus.

27:03.247 --> 27:05.033
He took her right
from under our noses.

27:05.249 --> 27:06.830
But why now?

27:07.794 --> 27:10.752
And what were they
doing behind that curtain?

27:16.928 --> 27:19.044
Looks like Tweety and
Sylvester have flown the coop.

27:19.263 --> 27:21.845
So, tell me,
was she in on this?

27:23.893 --> 27:25.383
I don't know.

27:25.603 --> 27:28.436
Look, she has the answers
that I need, so somebody

27:28.648 --> 27:32.857
better start talking, and lucky
boy, that's going to be you.

27:36.489 --> 27:41.609
When my family stole
lanka back from Marcus...

27:41.828 --> 27:44.535
my songstress
was not the same.

27:44.747 --> 27:48.706
There was a new light in her.

27:48.918 --> 27:51.250
And a new distance between us.

27:51.462 --> 27:56.502
lanka was never afraid
of Marcus. Not once.

27:56.717 --> 27:59.254
Are they partners?

27:59.470 --> 28:04.840
Marcus is a radical,
bent on hatred for all

28:05.059 --> 28:09.678
Baraqians.
That is all I know.

28:10.481 --> 28:12.563
Now leave.

28:16.821 --> 28:18.311
Bo! Over here.

28:27.373 --> 28:28.203
Check it out--

28:28.416 --> 28:30.202
This is where
Trick used to hide his

28:30.418 --> 28:31.954
rare Omni
transmitter. With it,

28:32.169 --> 28:34.581
Marcus could broadcast
anything, from anywhere.

28:34.797 --> 28:35.877
You fix cars, too?

28:36.090 --> 28:37.705
Who do think's been
changing your spark plugs?

28:37.925 --> 28:40.132
I love this side of you.

28:40.344 --> 28:42.084
Loveâ.

28:44.348 --> 28:45.383
Love.

28:45.600 --> 28:46.180
What?

28:46.392 --> 28:47.632
Dyson, they're in love!

28:47.852 --> 28:49.388
That's what Bamber
was trying to say.

28:49.604 --> 28:51.765
Marcus and lanka are in love.

28:51.981 --> 28:54.097
But, what's that got to
do with the transmitter?

28:54.317 --> 28:58.026
You think the Bambers would
ever let them be together?

29:00.072 --> 29:01.403
What if there
were no Bambers...

29:01.616 --> 29:04.153
lanka can sing death notes.

29:04.368 --> 29:08.156
She and Marcus...
they're gonna kill them all.

29:08.372 --> 29:10.784
Where?

29:11.000 --> 29:13.662
I overheard Hale
mention some kind

29:13.878 --> 29:16.415
of sonic stonework
on Bamber's estate.

29:16.631 --> 29:17.962
Come on, let's go.

29:18.174 --> 29:19.414
Bo-- There's dozens
of Baraqians.

29:19.634 --> 29:21.420
I have to warn
them all in person.

29:21.636 --> 29:23.627
Go get 'em, Wolfy.

29:25.222 --> 29:25.802
Bo!

29:26.015 --> 29:29.223
Hale is gone! Missing.

29:31.187 --> 29:34.805
Oh... What?

29:35.024 --> 29:39.358
These bird women, they could
hurt Fae with their voices.

29:39.570 --> 29:42.482
Hurt how?
Bad hurt? Dead hurt?

29:43.658 --> 29:43.942
I'm coming with.

29:44.158 --> 29:44.817
No. It's too dangerous.

29:45.034 --> 29:46.615
This is not a discussion!

29:46.827 --> 29:48.692
Hale's gone and I haven't
even told him that I--

29:48.913 --> 29:49.868
I know.

29:50.081 --> 29:52.663
Come on, let's go
kick some serious ass.

29:55.252 --> 29:57.038
lanka, stop! The
Baraqians are being

29:57.254 --> 29:59.461
warned of your
death note as we speak.

29:59.674 --> 30:01.835
Yeah! What she said!

30:02.051 --> 30:05.134
Death note? I am
singing no such thing.

30:05.346 --> 30:07.712
Marcus and I only
want to be together.

30:07.932 --> 30:08.967
And the transmitter?

30:09.183 --> 30:11.014
To tell his family
about our love.

30:11.227 --> 30:14.390
Right, my darling?

30:14.605 --> 30:20.066
lanka... Some things
are bigger than love.

30:20.945 --> 30:23.982
No-- You want me to...

30:25.574 --> 30:27.701
I will not kill the Bambers.

30:27.910 --> 30:29.866
I'm not asking.

30:30.079 --> 30:31.535
(whistle blowing)

30:31.747 --> 30:35.331
Ah! Please, Marcus, stop!

30:35.543 --> 30:39.752
(whistle blowing)

30:39.964 --> 30:49.384
(high-pitched screeching)

30:52.351 --> 30:54.091
Bo, Bo, help--

30:54.311 --> 30:55.346
No, not like that!

30:55.563 --> 30:56.643
Bo, let me finish him.

30:56.856 --> 30:59.188
I hear anything other
than the death note,

30:59.400 --> 31:00.765
this gun mows you all down.

31:00.985 --> 31:02.350
Everybody get out of here!

31:02.570 --> 31:03.855
Marcus and I need to talk.

31:04.071 --> 31:05.060
Kenz, leave!

31:05.281 --> 31:06.771
I'm not leaving! I came
here to rescue you!

31:06.991 --> 31:09.323
Guys, go!

31:09.535 --> 31:11.196
What is this? Soul Train?

31:11.412 --> 31:13.368
Marcus, please stop all this.

31:13.581 --> 31:17.199
This isn't you. This
anger, this ugly hate--

31:17.418 --> 31:19.158
Sing the death note.

31:19.378 --> 31:20.754
You love me.

31:20.963 --> 31:23.750
Just sing already, you bitch.

31:28.804 --> 31:33.173
(opera singing)

31:33.392 --> 31:34.222
Stop!

31:34.435 --> 31:35.800
Ahhhhh! No--

31:36.020 --> 31:37.931
Oh, Mother of
Metallica, this hurts!

31:38.147 --> 31:40.229
Hale, get the woman
you love out of here.

31:40.441 --> 31:41.271
Please!

31:41.484 --> 31:42.769
No!

31:42.985 --> 31:47.319
(opera singing)

31:47.531 --> 31:48.031
Oh, lanka--

31:48.240 --> 31:55.032
(opera singing)

31:55.247 --> 32:01.664
lanka... please...

32:01.879 --> 32:11.720
(opera singing)

32:11.931 --> 32:21.977
(opera singing)

32:23.526 --> 32:27.565
lanka, lanka, you did it.

32:27.780 --> 32:28.860
Marcus, he's--

32:29.073 --> 32:30.108
He's gone.

32:30.324 --> 32:32.030
Look, I will take
care of Bamber.

32:32.243 --> 32:34.780
You will be free, I promise.
Come on, can you walk?

32:34.995 --> 32:36.860
Ugh! No dear.

32:37.081 --> 32:42.872
You do not understand. I took
life in a weakened state.

32:43.087 --> 32:45.703
lam... no more.

32:45.923 --> 32:48.209
You're going to...

32:48.425 --> 32:51.553
Oh, lanka, please tell me
you didn't sacrifice yourself.

32:55.432 --> 33:00.176
Someone would have
always tried to own me.

33:00.396 --> 33:08.064
It is the fate of my people.
Most do not mind, but I do.

33:08.279 --> 33:12.864
I was the only one
who could stop it.

33:13.075 --> 33:14.611
I'm gonna call Trick.
There's gotta be

33:14.827 --> 33:17.614
something that we can do,
some kind of potion, or--

33:17.830 --> 33:23.700
In captivity, I heard stories
of the unaligned Succubus...

33:23.919 --> 33:28.583
You are what made me
believe I could be free.

33:28.799 --> 33:30.414
But I'm not unaligned anymore.

33:30.634 --> 33:35.003
Your heart is what
you want it to be.

33:35.222 --> 33:40.717
Right now, my heart is free.

33:43.480 --> 33:45.562
For you--

33:45.774 --> 33:49.107
As you wished.

33:49.320 --> 33:52.278
Oh, no... lanka, no.

34:09.924 --> 34:15.669
Ugh... Holy
high-pitched hangover.

34:15.888 --> 34:19.756
Whoa, whoa, not so
fast. There you are.

34:19.975 --> 34:24.344
Ugh. Oh-- What
happened? Where's Bo?

34:24.563 --> 34:30.024
She'll be fine. lanka sung
a death note. Marcus is dead.

34:30.236 --> 34:31.851
Oh.

34:32.071 --> 34:34.062
Good for her.

34:34.281 --> 34:36.738
It will have killed her, too.

34:38.118 --> 34:42.532
Oh, Hale... I'm so sorry.

34:42.748 --> 34:44.363
She's finally free.

34:44.583 --> 34:45.288
Yeah.

34:45.501 --> 34:50.541
And you-- You're finally here.

34:53.259 --> 34:57.252
I've... always been here.

35:14.488 --> 35:18.447
Now truth, lanka's death
note, did it hurt you?

35:18.659 --> 35:20.741
No.

35:20.953 --> 35:23.285
Hey, you lie to
the Russian stink eye,

35:23.497 --> 35:26.330
and bad things will
happen to yourjunk.

35:26.542 --> 35:30.956
Which would now be a
particular bummer for me.

35:31.171 --> 35:37.758
This Russian stink eye...
it's pretty intense.

35:40.097 --> 35:42.133
You'll get used to it.

36:06.749 --> 36:13.040
(opera singing)

36:13.255 --> 36:15.541
(train whistling)

36:15.758 --> 36:27.852
(opera singing)

36:28.062 --> 36:31.395
Oh, no... No, please--

36:31.607 --> 36:33.518
I can't do this.

36:47.414 --> 36:48.403
Bo?

36:48.624 --> 36:57.794
k?

36:59.927 --> 37:02.543
Don't tell me you don't wear
a mask to protect yourself.

37:02.763 --> 37:06.881
Hm. Yours is
especially... chilling.

37:07.101 --> 37:08.762
The higher you climb,
the more you realize that

37:08.977 --> 37:10.433
you're surrounded by
sycophants and assassins.

37:10.646 --> 37:13.729
(laughs) You're so dramatic.

37:13.941 --> 37:16.432
No, I am realistic in
a dramatic world, honey.

37:16.652 --> 37:18.768
You'll see.

37:18.987 --> 37:21.979
You'll get your share of
sycophants and assassins too.

37:22.199 --> 37:24.110
Oh yeah? Which one are you?

37:24.326 --> 37:27.068
For now? You can
call me a friend.

37:29.832 --> 37:31.663
This is the key
to the Dark science

37:31.875 --> 37:33.911
and medical
testing facilities.

37:34.128 --> 37:37.291
It's yours. Full access.

37:37.506 --> 37:38.370
I won't sign anything.

37:38.590 --> 37:39.966
I'm not asking.

37:40.175 --> 37:41.915
You are a brilliant woman.

37:42.136 --> 37:43.842
Own it, girlfriend.

37:53.147 --> 37:54.387
I'll never trust you.

37:54.606 --> 37:57.188
I wouldn't respect
you if you did.

37:57.401 --> 38:00.643
But do remember, I let
you see me eat pizza.

38:00.863 --> 38:03.570
You think I just
let any schmo do that?

38:06.034 --> 38:08.696
Here are the keys
to your new condo.

38:08.912 --> 38:12.075
Call me if you
need anything else.

38:12.291 --> 38:16.284
This was ah...
what do they call it?

38:16.503 --> 38:18.880
Fun. Right?

38:26.555 --> 38:27.715
Evony.

38:36.190 --> 38:39.398
Pizza's our secret.

38:39.610 --> 38:44.695
I think this might be the
beginning of a beautiful...

38:44.907 --> 38:46.568
something.

38:48.744 --> 38:51.451
Still don't trust you.

38:51.663 --> 38:54.279
You don't have to, Dr. Lewis.

38:54.500 --> 38:57.207
You are team Dark now.

39:00.088 --> 39:03.501
I can taste it.

39:03.717 --> 39:05.082
Ta, darling.

40:06.154 --> 40:11.490
To... it beginning.

40:21.628 --> 40:31.799
(sexual grunts and pants)

40:32.014 --> 40:34.255
Bo... look at me.

40:34.474 --> 40:48.821
(sexual grunts and pants)

40:49.031 --> 40:51.693
Bo... please, look at me.

40:52.826 --> 40:55.533
Don't tell me what do to.

41:00.125 --> 41:01.240
I'm sorry.

41:02.961 --> 41:05.623
I'm sorry, I'm just uh...

41:05.839 --> 41:10.082
Angry. It's okay.

41:10.302 --> 41:12.463
No one owns you.

41:12.679 --> 41:16.046
You're not going
to be like lanka.

41:16.266 --> 41:20.680
No. I'll become like Marcus.

41:20.896 --> 41:24.434
Bitter, choking
on my bottomless rage,

41:24.650 --> 41:27.767
thinking of
nothing but revenge.

41:30.447 --> 41:35.032
lanka died to
be free, Dyson.

41:35.243 --> 41:37.450
For just a few moments.

41:37.663 --> 41:39.278
And you inspired
her to do that.

41:39.498 --> 41:44.868
No, not me. Another Bo.

41:45.087 --> 41:47.544
One that I don't even know.

41:53.470 --> 41:58.180
Whoever that Bo was, she didn't
spend a month asleep in limbo.

41:58.392 --> 42:00.633
She was on a train,
hatching a plan.

42:00.852 --> 42:04.765
Sending herself
clues in the future.

42:04.981 --> 42:12.023
She... I... joined the Dark.

42:14.408 --> 42:16.148
Willingly.

42:20.956 --> 42:23.038
Then I'm sure you
had good reason.

42:23.250 --> 42:28.995
Besides, Dark... Light...
these are just labels.

42:29.214 --> 42:31.500
They do not define us.

42:33.468 --> 42:36.210
Looks like I'm not the
only one who's changed.

42:38.807 --> 42:43.972
(gasping)

42:44.187 --> 42:46.269
You're hurt.

42:46.481 --> 42:51.145
I don't know.
But I am hurting.

42:52.904 --> 42:54.735
He marked me.

42:54.948 --> 42:56.779
Who?

42:56.992 --> 43:04.114
The Wanderer. Rainer.
He might be my father.

43:06.418 --> 43:07.032
(g rowls)

43:07.252 --> 43:08.207
What the hell is this?!

43:08.420 --> 43:09.626
Mole patrol?

43:09.838 --> 43:13.205
The codex of laws
has been infringed upon.

43:13.425 --> 43:15.165
Your rules don't apply to me.

43:15.385 --> 43:16.966
Not you.

43:17.179 --> 43:19.386
Him.

43:19.598 --> 43:20.303
Dyson, no!

43:20.515 --> 43:35.067
(growling)
