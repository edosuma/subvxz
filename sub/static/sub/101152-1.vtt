00:59.908 --> 01:01.660
<i>Earlier today, Iraq war planes</i>

01:01.744 --> 01:05.664
<i>hit at least nine Iranian
air bases from Shiraz to the gulf.</i>

01:05.748 --> 01:07.916
<i>He's been attempting
to destabilize the government</i>

01:08.000 --> 01:09.376
<i>throughout the Arab Gulf.</i>

01:09.460 --> 01:11.086
<i>In three separate wars
of these countries,</i>

01:11.170 --> 01:13.630
<i>thousands of citizens
on both sides have been killed,</i>

01:13.714 --> 01:15.132
<i>and many more injured...</i>

01:15.215 --> 01:20.763
<i>with no military or psychological benefit
to either side, only suffering.</i>

01:22.931 --> 01:25.309
Whoa, dude. You okay?

01:25.392 --> 01:27.060
<i>...continue to try and flee the country</i>

01:27.144 --> 01:29.313
<i>as the brutal and bloody conflict</i>

01:29.396 --> 01:32.191
<i>between Iran and Iraq
continues to rage on.</i>

01:32.274 --> 01:34.651
- Ah, shit!
- <i>America, the Soviet...</i>

01:35.736 --> 01:37.821
Yeah, it was just a bad dream.

01:37.905 --> 01:39.782
Okay. Well, just shake it off, all right?

01:39.865 --> 01:42.493
Everything's fine. You worry too much.

01:42.576 --> 01:44.453
My mother, she's...

01:44.536 --> 01:46.455
she's very sick and it's a long flight.

01:46.538 --> 01:49.958
Ah, everything's gonna be
fine, dude. Okay?

01:50.042 --> 01:53.212
Now, get ready. We're gonna be late.
It's the first day of practice.

01:53.295 --> 01:56.423
- What do you mean you haven't seen it?
- No. What is a <i>Star Wars?</i>

01:56.507 --> 01:59.843
Um, only like the best movie ever?
The sequel just came out.

01:59.927 --> 02:01.178
Hello? Yoda?

02:01.261 --> 02:03.597
"Do. Or do not. There is no try."

02:03.680 --> 02:05.307
Ah, that was terrible.

02:05.390 --> 02:07.226
- You're crazy.
- Well, you gotta see it.

02:29.665 --> 02:30.833
All right. Circle around.

02:34.878 --> 02:38.215
Every one of you has come from a place
where you were the best.

02:38.298 --> 02:42.219
<i>Well, guess what, small fish?
You're in 2 big pond now.</i>

02:42.302 --> 02:45.973
And you're gonna have to work harder
than you've ever worked in your lives.

02:46.056 --> 02:49.309
Because a champion
isn't just born, gentlemen.

02:49.393 --> 02:51.854
A champion takes what
he already has inside

02:51.937 --> 02:55.899
and he forges that to make himself
into something greater.

02:57.025 --> 02:58.569
Let's get started.

02:58.652 --> 03:00.487
Chet, let's get 'em warmed up.

03:00.571 --> 03:02.447
- Yes, coach!
- One, two, three!

03:02.531 --> 03:04.199
Let's move!

03:07.202 --> 03:11.081
Come here. I didn't want another
foreign scholarship on my roster.

03:11.164 --> 03:14.084
You wanna stay?
You gotta show me something.

03:14.167 --> 03:15.502
Yes, Coach!

03:17.337 --> 03:19.506
This ain't high school, camel jockey.

03:22.551 --> 03:25.053
I appreciate you driving,
but I could've picked them up on my own.

03:25.137 --> 03:29.349
Are you kidding me?
I'm excited to see your parents.

03:29.433 --> 03:31.810
Have not seen them
since I left Iran, so...

03:36.273 --> 03:39.151
- Whatever happened to your girlfriend?
- She moved away.

03:39.234 --> 03:41.153
Hmm. College, huh?

03:41.236 --> 03:43.614
Well, you're in college now,

03:43.697 --> 03:47.492
with all the fish
in the ocean, huh?

03:47.576 --> 03:50.662
Besides, you're very handsome, huh?

03:50.746 --> 03:52.331
Okay. Okay, Pasha.

03:53.332 --> 03:54.750
Where are your parents?

03:57.836 --> 03:58.962
I don't know.

04:05.052 --> 04:06.470
Uh, Jahani?

04:07.471 --> 04:10.265
Yeah, he-he's Jahani.

04:10.349 --> 04:12.809
Uh, hi, I'm, ah, Captain Dennis Martin

04:12.893 --> 04:17.022
and, um, I don't know
how to tell you this but, urn,

04:17.105 --> 04:21.108
there was an incident in Tehran
before the flight left.

04:22.694 --> 04:24.988
Excuse me, sir?

04:25.072 --> 04:26.406
Sir, everyone has been boarded and, um...

05:53.577 --> 05:58.373
Mrs. Jahani did not return to the flight.
I-I don't know what's become of her.

05:58.457 --> 06:00.500
I-I don't have any other information.

07:18.245 --> 07:19.955
Ali, it's time to go.

07:27.963 --> 07:29.756
<i>There's gotta be
something you can do.</i>

07:29.840 --> 07:31.383
<i>Look, I can appreciate the effort here,</i>

07:31.466 --> 07:33.510
<i>but we have no jurisdiction in Iran.</i>

07:33.593 --> 07:35.387
I get it, but my mother is very sick.

07:36.596 --> 07:39.516
Do you think you're the only person trying
to get a family member in this country?

07:39.599 --> 07:41.434
Get in line, Mr. Jobani.

07:41.518 --> 07:43.854
- Jahani. It's Jahani.
- I'm sorry. Like I said,

07:43.937 --> 07:46.356
- there's nothing we can do to help.
- Just don't worry.

07:46.439 --> 07:48.608
I know someone I think might be able
to help us out.

07:49.609 --> 07:50.610
Come on. Let's go.

08:00.704 --> 08:02.038
I already spoke to Immigration.

08:02.122 --> 08:04.040
They can do nothing for you.

08:04.124 --> 08:08.545
We have to go through a private operation
and it will cost you more.

08:08.628 --> 08:11.381
- How much more?
- Hold the line.

08:15.719 --> 08:17.387
Hello?

08:17.470 --> 08:20.682
For transport, land, air, $10,000.

08:22.642 --> 08:24.603
Another 10,000 for bribes...

08:25.770 --> 08:29.941
ten thousand for passport.
Altogether, $30,000.

08:31.651 --> 08:33.695
Okay.

08:33.778 --> 08:35.864
How can it be $30,0007?

08:35.947 --> 08:39.743
This is still without my fee.
I'm not charging you.

08:39.826 --> 08:43.038
And I'm the one who can do
this kind of operation.

08:45.040 --> 08:47.209
Well, I don't have 30,000.

08:49.753 --> 08:53.506
Could you at least make $15,000 to start?

08:53.590 --> 08:58.470
Ali, you should really
try some of this <i>Nan-e Badami.</i>

08:58.553 --> 09:01.306
He says it's going to cost
30,000 to get her out.

09:01.389 --> 09:03.308
Fifteen to get started.

09:12.859 --> 09:15.445
Well, ah, okay.

09:15.528 --> 09:17.364
I can put together, ah...

09:19.574 --> 09:20.533
Five-thousand.

09:20.617 --> 09:22.410
I could put together $5,000.

09:22.494 --> 09:24.746
Still, we need $10,000 more.

09:24.829 --> 09:28.667
Ah, I can sell the car,
and I have a little money in the bank.

09:28.750 --> 09:30.126
It might be enough.

09:30.210 --> 09:32.629
Pasha introduced me to a guy named Mr. V.

09:32.712 --> 09:35.548
and he says he can help,
but it's gonna cost so much money.

09:35.632 --> 09:38.760
With-without treatment in America,

09:38.843 --> 09:41.263
her cancer is just gonna...

09:44.849 --> 09:46.434
All right. Well, what-what now?

09:46.518 --> 09:47.769
What-what do we do now?

09:48.895 --> 09:50.480
We have to try something.

09:51.940 --> 09:54.651
So after I empty my bank account
and sell the car,

09:54.734 --> 09:56.236
I'll still have to raise
the rest of the money.

09:56.319 --> 10:00.407
And at $3.35 an hour...
it will take me...

10:03.159 --> 10:04.661
five-hundred and ninety-seven days.

10:04.744 --> 10:08.081
No. That's-that's minimum wage, dude.
You... We can do better than that.

10:17.257 --> 10:18.133
Yeah?

10:19.134 --> 10:20.593
Hey, I, uh, I heard about the job?

10:22.012 --> 10:27.434
Uh, look, kid, every guy out
there's a third-generation union member,

10:27.517 --> 10:30.437
so I'm not givin' an American job
to a foreigner, okay?

10:30.520 --> 10:33.064
What is "Jazzercise instructor"?

10:33.148 --> 10:36.276
Well, don't circle it
if you don't know what it is.

10:49.539 --> 10:50.915
There you go, baby.

11:01.968 --> 11:03.887
It's $9,000.

11:03.970 --> 11:06.514
It's not even enough for the deposit.

11:06.598 --> 11:08.892
How're we supposed to get 16,000 more?

11:10.352 --> 11:11.853
We'll figure somethin' out.

11:14.397 --> 11:17.317
<i>All right. Chet, Ali!
You're up and running. Half-circle.</i>

11:20.236 --> 11:22.197
Time to play with the big boys, Ali-baba.

11:35.001 --> 11:36.669
You think you're slick, huh?

11:40.256 --> 11:42.050
- Come on, Ali!
- You ain't shit.

11:42.133 --> 11:43.426
Towel head!

11:45.095 --> 11:46.304
What the hell?

11:52.102 --> 11:53.353
All right. Get in there.

11:53.436 --> 11:54.938
Break it up!

11:56.398 --> 11:59.067
- Whoa-whoa, easy.
- Come on!

11:59.150 --> 12:00.068
Okay! Enough!

12:00.151 --> 12:02.487
What the hell, man?! It's practice.

12:02.570 --> 12:04.280
- What the hell?
- What the hell?

12:05.365 --> 12:06.950
I gotta say, I'm impressed, man.

12:07.033 --> 12:10.245
You know, I didn't realize
you were such a-a fighter.

12:10.328 --> 12:12.330
Where'd you, uh... where'd you
learn how to strike like that?

12:12.414 --> 12:13.456
Hey, asshole,

12:13.540 --> 12:15.583
you got some lucky shots in there.

12:15.667 --> 12:19.212
- Why don't you take a hike, Chet?
- I ain't talkin' to you, Caulder.

12:19.295 --> 12:22.632
You try to pull that shit again,
I'll break you on the mat.

12:22.715 --> 12:23.842
Hey, how's your face?

12:25.343 --> 12:27.137
We got a little comedian
on our hands, huh?

12:29.264 --> 12:30.640
Uh-oh.

12:30.723 --> 12:33.726
And I got an itch to hunt me
a little dune coon.

12:33.810 --> 12:35.186
You wanna play?

12:35.270 --> 12:39.315
Nice truck, Chet.

12:39.399 --> 12:41.359
- You stay out of this.
- But it's so big.

12:41.443 --> 12:43.570
Hey, do you know what they say
about guys with big trucks?

12:43.653 --> 12:45.989
- Oh, what's that?
- Tiny stick-shifts.

12:47.782 --> 12:49.492
Why don't you hop in and we can find out?

12:49.576 --> 12:52.495
Great, I have two minutes before class.
We can even do it twice.

12:53.496 --> 12:55.039
This ain't over, hash brown.

12:55.123 --> 12:56.958
See you later.

12:59.752 --> 13:01.671
Thanks, Heidi.

13:01.754 --> 13:04.299
No worries. That guy is all bark
and no bite.

13:04.382 --> 13:06.801
I'm Heidi, by the way. You okay?

13:06.885 --> 13:10.513
Ali. And yeah, I'm fine.
I'm used to this.

13:10.597 --> 13:13.308
Well, you shouldn't be. It's 1981.

13:13.391 --> 13:16.144
Racist assholes like that
should be tarred and feathered.

13:23.526 --> 13:25.069
All right. Well...

13:25.153 --> 13:29.282
We obviously owe you big time,
so how do we repay you?

13:29.365 --> 13:34.412
How about your buddy here comes with me
to the Kappa Fundraiser on Friday?

13:34.496 --> 13:36.247
- I will check.
- He'll definitely do that.

13:36.331 --> 13:39.417
And, uh, I just happened to be
free that night too, so...

13:39.501 --> 13:41.169
Great. Becky's gonna be there.

13:41.252 --> 13:42.879
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

13:42.962 --> 13:46.257
- Okay, then.
- We will see you guys there.

13:46.341 --> 13:49.135
Bring your skates.

13:49.219 --> 13:50.345
Yes, girl!

13:50.428 --> 13:55.266
Whoo-hoo! That's not very nice.
I just got you a date and me too, so...

13:55.350 --> 13:57.101
I don't need a date. I need money.

13:58.102 --> 13:59.437
About that...

14:00.522 --> 14:03.525
that punch you threw in practice,
you think you could do that again?

14:07.695 --> 14:10.698
- You ever heard of underground fighting?
- What do you mean?

14:10.782 --> 14:14.494
Any style goes.
Two guys go head-to-head for cash.

14:22.335 --> 14:23.586
Don't freak out.

14:27.006 --> 14:30.093
A little bit crazy, but I made
some good money here back in the day.

14:36.599 --> 14:38.393
- You used to do this?
- My uncle was really big,

14:38.476 --> 14:39.769
so I fought a few times.

14:39.852 --> 14:41.437
Think you can handle that?

14:41.521 --> 14:42.772
Oh, yeah!

14:46.317 --> 14:48.820
I know the guy that runs the place.
I'm gonna introduce you,

14:48.903 --> 14:51.239
but you're gonna have to make
a little bit of an impression.

14:57.078 --> 14:59.122
Whoa!

14:59.205 --> 15:01.708
Whoo!

15:09.549 --> 15:12.468
- What's the damage, Duke?
- He'll be fine.

15:15.972 --> 15:18.349
Young man! Young Ryan.

15:18.433 --> 15:20.059
How are you, kid? Are you good?

15:20.143 --> 15:21.978
- I'm doing good.
- A long time, son.

15:22.061 --> 15:24.230
- I know, right?
- You here to make me some money?

15:24.314 --> 15:26.816
- No. No.
- Come on. Get yourself in the ring.

15:26.899 --> 15:28.151
- Get in!
- No, no.

15:28.234 --> 15:31.321
I don't do that anymore, you know?
I'm in college now, man.

15:32.947 --> 15:33.948
You're in college?

15:34.032 --> 15:35.366
Business, of course.

15:35.450 --> 15:37.368
- Oh!
- Yeah.

15:37.452 --> 15:39.037
- Man, that's so cool!
- Yeah.

15:39.120 --> 15:41.873
Hey, Duke, young Ryan's in college!

15:45.460 --> 15:46.919
- Proud of you, son.
- Thank you.

15:47.003 --> 15:48.630
So, who is this young fella?

15:49.714 --> 15:52.925
Uh, I wrestle with Ryan. I'm Ali.

15:53.009 --> 15:54.761
- You do what?
- He...

15:54.844 --> 15:56.679
We're on a team, like a class in college.

15:56.763 --> 16:00.099
- Okay. Yeah. All right.
- Can we talk in private?

16:02.977 --> 16:05.438
- Wha-what? What did I do?
- Wrestling together?

16:08.149 --> 16:10.360
Follow me, gentlemen.

16:10.443 --> 16:14.113
- Don't say anything stupid.
- I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

16:16.699 --> 16:18.409
So why you brought me here, Ryan?

16:20.036 --> 16:23.164
Um, I think he's got potential.

16:26.542 --> 16:30.088
So what makes you think you got the balls
to come down here

16:30.171 --> 16:32.840
and mix it up with some of my fighters?

16:34.092 --> 16:35.343
Are you man enough?

16:37.720 --> 16:38.554
Yeah?

16:39.555 --> 16:41.808
You know, this ain't no wrestling club

16:41.891 --> 16:45.895
with two boys in leotards
trying to pin each other to a canvas.

16:45.978 --> 16:48.481
It's not that.

16:48.564 --> 16:51.567
See, you get hurt in this game, bad.

16:53.528 --> 16:54.654
What are you?

16:56.155 --> 16:57.699
Mexicani?

16:59.075 --> 17:00.284
Persian.

17:00.368 --> 17:03.788
Persian. Even better.

17:05.873 --> 17:07.333
Okay.

17:09.252 --> 17:14.214
I give you $300, you step in that ring.

17:14.298 --> 17:19.721
I give you 300 more
if by some miracle he wins.

17:19.804 --> 17:23.516
And if I like ya,
might be a little bit more.

17:26.602 --> 17:31.691
All you have to do is last 15 minutes

17:31.774 --> 17:34.444
in that 20 by 20-foot ring.

17:34.527 --> 17:36.988
Now, do you think you can do that, son?

17:37.989 --> 17:39.907
So, you just pay us to beat each other up?

17:42.618 --> 17:43.911
Is that even legal?

17:48.082 --> 17:50.793
"Is that even legal?" Jesus Christ.

17:50.877 --> 17:54.213
Boys, get this fella outta here,
would you please?

17:54.297 --> 17:56.883
Wait. No. Okay. It's fine. I'll try it.

17:56.966 --> 17:58.760
- Just-just let me try. Let me fight.
- Wait, wait...

17:58.843 --> 17:59.886
- Once. Just give me a chance.
- Come on. Really?

17:59.969 --> 18:01.429
Come on. Give me a chance!

18:03.306 --> 18:06.184
Yeah! Get that sand-nigger out of here!

18:06.267 --> 18:08.519
Whoo! Whoo!

18:21.073 --> 18:22.658
Get... Get off!

18:28.164 --> 18:29.582
Enough!

18:37.882 --> 18:40.259
When I say enough, I mean enough!

18:41.260 --> 18:42.678
It means stop!

18:46.599 --> 18:48.392
All right, boy.

18:50.937 --> 18:53.564
So you already got
a set of <i>cojones</i> on you.

18:53.648 --> 18:55.233
I told you he had potential.

18:55.316 --> 18:58.319
This Friday, your first fight.

18:58.402 --> 19:00.363
Don't let me down.

19:00.446 --> 19:04.158
If you ever come at my place again
and embarrass me like that...

19:05.409 --> 19:08.496
I'll put you in a hole.
You understand?

19:17.088 --> 19:19.799
Whoa. You're fucking crazy!

19:19.882 --> 19:22.718
Okay, now, before your first fight,

19:22.802 --> 19:25.513
we're gonna need to work on your striking
a little bit, 'cause you got a good arm,

19:25.596 --> 19:27.098
but you're gonna need
more than that in the ring.

19:27.181 --> 19:30.560
No, no, no. I appreciate you taking me
down there, but I'm doing this on my own.

19:30.643 --> 19:33.437
Bullshit, you're doing it on your own.
I'm helpin' you.

19:33.521 --> 19:35.982
Ryan, you can't risk college
and your spot on the team for me.

19:36.065 --> 19:38.276
- What about your spot on the team?
- It's my problem, not yours.

19:38.359 --> 19:40.319
Okay, tough guy. Settle down for a second.

19:40.403 --> 19:41.821
You know I'm right, okay?

19:41.904 --> 19:43.948
Second, you're a good grappler.
I'll give you that,

19:44.031 --> 19:45.825
but you're gonna need
more than that in the ring, man.

19:45.908 --> 19:48.411
Okay, my uncle taught me how to box
since before I could even walk,

19:48.494 --> 19:51.581
and I fought in there before.
So I'm already involved.

19:51.664 --> 19:53.416
Might as well just let me help you.

19:54.917 --> 19:57.086
Don't walk away from me like that.

19:58.504 --> 20:00.548
Hey, you didn't say "no"!

20:05.636 --> 20:08.347
Right. All right.

20:08.431 --> 20:10.850
So you're Ryan's roommate, right?

20:10.933 --> 20:12.518
How'd you know I was Ryan's roommate?

20:12.602 --> 20:15.396
Jedi Mind trick.

20:15.479 --> 20:18.065
Does that have to do
with that little Yoda guy?

20:18.149 --> 20:20.443
Oh, clearly, the Force is not with you.

20:20.526 --> 20:22.486
Clearly, you're one of Ryan's friends.

20:22.570 --> 20:25.031
Yeah, he's basically like my big brother.

20:25.114 --> 20:28.242
Heads up, Ali! Whoo!

20:28.326 --> 20:30.244
- Whoa! Oh...
- Not cool.

20:31.704 --> 20:34.415
Apparently not. I'm sorry.

20:34.498 --> 20:37.126
Whoo!

20:37.209 --> 20:38.502
- Okay?
- Yeah.

20:41.422 --> 20:43.007
Hello, my lady!

20:46.218 --> 20:47.720
- You got it.
- How is this fun?

20:47.803 --> 20:48.804
Right.

21:01.943 --> 21:05.488
- Yeah, I really liked <i>Rocky.</i>
- Uh, I love <i>Rocky.</i>

21:06.781 --> 21:11.243
All right. So now it's time
for you to ask me out.

21:12.244 --> 21:13.496
Show us interest.

21:14.497 --> 21:17.875
I mean, assuming
that you are interested...

22:07.591 --> 22:09.093
Ali, you're up.

22:20.187 --> 22:22.356
Let's see if this kid can make some money.

22:23.774 --> 22:26.235
Gentlemen, please, please.

22:26.318 --> 22:29.447
Tonight, I have something special for you.

22:29.530 --> 22:31.741
This young man here
is from the Middle East.

22:31.824 --> 22:35.786
He reckons he can kick some US ass!

22:37.538 --> 22:41.542
Oh! Don't shoot the messenger.

22:41.625 --> 22:44.128
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...
Name, kid?

22:44.211 --> 22:45.296
- Ali.
- Ali what?

22:45.379 --> 22:49.633
- Ali Jahani.
- Ali Pajamas. Ali Pajamas!

22:49.717 --> 22:52.887
And you know this gentleman
over here, that's a warrior.

22:54.972 --> 22:58.309
The one and only "Bone Crusher" Jones!

22:58.392 --> 23:00.311
Yeah!

23:00.394 --> 23:01.771
- You set?
- Set.

23:01.854 --> 23:03.022
Are you set?

23:03.105 --> 23:05.316
Let's go. Come on!
Let's do this!

23:05.399 --> 23:07.401
Fight!

23:15.618 --> 23:16.577
Hands!

23:16.660 --> 23:18.079
Ali, put your hands up!

23:18.162 --> 23:19.497
Put 'em up. Come on!

23:27.379 --> 23:28.214
Shit...

23:41.602 --> 23:43.354
Get up, Ali. Up!

24:03.541 --> 24:04.375
Come on.

24:15.302 --> 24:17.179
Hit him! Hit him! Yes!

24:21.642 --> 24:22.935
Yeah!

24:24.812 --> 24:27.523
O-o-o-oh. Okay.

24:27.606 --> 24:29.108
You killed him.

24:30.109 --> 24:31.569
Come on, gentlemen.

24:32.820 --> 24:34.864
Give it up for the Beast of the East.

24:34.947 --> 24:38.409
Ali, everybody! Give it up!

24:40.327 --> 24:42.913
Oh, shit.

24:42.997 --> 24:45.332
All right. How many fingers you see?

24:45.416 --> 24:47.793
It's a trick question.
You just got your ass kicked.

24:47.877 --> 24:49.170
Loser!

24:49.253 --> 24:51.755
I'm impressed, kid. Very impressed.

24:53.090 --> 24:56.218
So, where did you
learn to fight like that?

24:57.469 --> 24:58.470
Out there...

24:58.554 --> 25:01.515
You want a beer?

25:03.225 --> 25:05.186
Of course you do. Come on.

25:07.771 --> 25:09.356
Well, here's...

25:10.900 --> 25:13.068
Here's to many more, champ.

25:13.152 --> 25:14.403
Well done.

25:16.405 --> 25:18.199
So...

25:20.034 --> 25:23.954
we said three for fighting.

25:24.038 --> 25:26.457
One, two, three.

25:28.042 --> 25:32.963
And one, two, three for winnin'.

25:35.174 --> 25:38.385
And here's an extra one 'cause I like ya.

25:39.720 --> 25:41.931
Go see Duke. Get yourself cleaned up.

25:43.140 --> 25:44.391
Well done.

25:53.776 --> 25:56.237
All right, kid.

25:57.238 --> 25:58.239
Chin up.

26:00.115 --> 26:02.034
That hurt?

26:02.117 --> 26:03.786
Your nose ain't broke.

26:03.869 --> 26:06.872
A little plug up the nostril.

26:08.707 --> 26:12.503
And just ice, keep the swelling down, huh?

26:16.674 --> 26:18.133
So wrestling, huh?

26:21.303 --> 26:22.680
It's a good base.

26:22.763 --> 26:24.682
Can build a hell of a fighter out of that.

26:24.765 --> 26:26.350
Build?

26:27.351 --> 26:28.602
I won.

26:30.229 --> 26:31.772
Yeah, yeah.

26:32.773 --> 26:35.693
No need to build. That's just a fight.

26:40.030 --> 26:43.617
Dude, have you seen my towel?
Ah, never mind. Got it.

26:44.618 --> 26:46.912
Dude, what is that?

26:46.996 --> 26:47.997
What?

26:50.040 --> 26:51.500
Here, dumbass.

26:52.918 --> 26:54.920
Courtesy of my last girlfriend.

26:56.046 --> 26:58.048
It's for your face.
You put it on your face.

26:59.049 --> 27:01.885
You... Don't... all right. Don't put a lot.

27:01.969 --> 27:04.471
I mean, coach is gonna notice
you have makeup on.

27:04.555 --> 27:05.848
Yeah, there you go.

27:05.931 --> 27:07.808
Put some under the eye, too.

27:07.891 --> 27:08.934
Just smooth it.

27:09.935 --> 27:10.811
Yeah, there you go.

27:10.894 --> 27:12.771
Yeah. Yeah, that's bad.

27:12.855 --> 27:14.648
It's not good at all.
Here, give this to me.

27:21.113 --> 27:24.575
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

27:24.658 --> 27:27.703
I, uh, didn't see you as a librarian,

27:27.786 --> 27:29.830
but, uh, here you are.

27:29.913 --> 27:30.956
It's part-time.

27:31.040 --> 27:34.043
Apparently, I'm too loud
to be a full-time librarian.

27:34.126 --> 27:35.002
Shh.

27:36.086 --> 27:38.047
See?

27:38.130 --> 27:40.424
No. It's a...
it's actually a punishment job.

27:40.507 --> 27:43.177
I filled two book returns
with shaving cream.

27:43.260 --> 27:46.764
Sorority prank, some of my best work.
Thank you very much.

27:49.141 --> 27:50.309
Can I see your hands, please?

27:51.810 --> 27:53.729
Yeah. Is there something wrong with them?

27:53.812 --> 27:55.773
Hmm, I was asking myself the same thing.

27:55.856 --> 27:57.691
I thought your fingers might be broke...

27:58.776 --> 28:00.069
Because my phone hasn't rang.

28:02.071 --> 28:03.697
Just the book, please.

28:24.885 --> 28:26.720
I'll see you Friday.

28:26.804 --> 28:29.098
See you Friday.

28:53.914 --> 28:54.748
Yes!

28:57.751 --> 28:58.877
Yeah!

29:09.805 --> 29:10.806
Come on!

29:35.330 --> 29:38.459
Whoa! Shut up!

29:38.542 --> 29:40.377
Give it up for Ali!

29:41.378 --> 29:42.379
Good fight, kid.

29:43.380 --> 29:44.673
Now pay up!

29:46.383 --> 29:47.593
Thank you.

29:48.844 --> 29:50.262
Thank you.

29:51.263 --> 29:52.347
Thank you.

29:54.933 --> 29:56.643
Thank you, gentlemen.

29:56.727 --> 29:57.895
All right, gentlemen.

29:57.978 --> 30:02.191
Next up, tonight, we got a local boy.

30:03.317 --> 30:05.235
Edson, get out here.

30:09.281 --> 30:14.244
And straight...
straight from the college campus,

30:14.328 --> 30:18.665
"Iron" Ryan Caulder! Give it up!

30:20.918 --> 30:21.752
Set!

30:22.753 --> 30:24.129
Don't worry, son.

30:26.340 --> 30:28.008
This ain't his first rodeo.

31:04.211 --> 31:06.755
Come on, get right up, come on.

31:06.838 --> 31:09.007
Whoo! Baby, come on!

31:09.091 --> 31:10.759
Come on!

31:12.010 --> 31:14.429
Come on, get up! Get up!

31:15.931 --> 31:19.351
- Ali! Whoo! See that?
- Ryan, what are you doing?

31:19.434 --> 31:21.103
What are you talking about?
I'm helping you.

31:21.186 --> 31:22.271
You get to take what I win.

31:22.354 --> 31:24.189
- You're gonna get kicked off the team.
- Yeah, yeah. Okay.

31:24.273 --> 31:26.400
God, I forgot
how good this felt, man. Whoo!

31:26.483 --> 31:27.526
I don't need your help.

31:27.609 --> 31:30.612
Hey, you don't get to choose
who helps you. All right?

31:35.576 --> 31:39.288
Well, I bet it feels good
to ride a three-legged donkey, doesn't it?

31:40.831 --> 31:42.207
What?

31:42.291 --> 31:44.793
Well, I've seen you.

31:44.876 --> 31:49.840
You seem pretty proud of yourself
with that fireman's body slam, huh?

31:49.923 --> 31:51.925
Well, I won, didn't I?

31:53.427 --> 31:57.055
Yeah, you know, as long as
you're against donkeys with two legs,

31:57.139 --> 32:00.309
but God help you if you find yourself
against a donkey with four.

32:01.435 --> 32:04.187
Yeah, I'll ride whatever they want
as long as get the money.

32:04.271 --> 32:07.816
Yeah. Well, you ever grow up,

32:07.899 --> 32:09.693
learn to focus, put in your time,

32:09.776 --> 32:11.987
maybe you find yourself
with a horse to ride.

32:12.988 --> 32:14.906
I don't need a horse.

32:14.990 --> 32:18.285
- Why don't you have another drink?
- Why, I will do that.

32:20.662 --> 32:21.955
Little shit.

32:24.625 --> 32:26.918
<i>Hey, so the man
who cleans up the fighters...</i>

32:27.002 --> 32:30.839
Duke? Yeah,
he's a sad bastard, huh?

32:30.922 --> 32:33.258
He keeps trying to give me philosophy.

32:33.342 --> 32:35.927
Like, to be the best,
you have to be the best.

32:36.011 --> 32:38.639
Don't listen to him, man.
He's just an old drunk.

32:38.722 --> 32:41.767
He actually used to be a fighter
though, him and, ah, McClellan.

32:41.850 --> 32:43.226
They go way back.

32:43.310 --> 32:46.229
I think my uncle
actually fought him one time.

32:48.357 --> 32:49.775
So, what happened to him?

32:51.693 --> 32:54.404
I dunno. I know he got hurt really bad,

32:54.488 --> 32:58.992
but you know fighters,
they can't really last forever.

33:08.418 --> 33:10.212
Did Ryan tell you to do this?

33:10.295 --> 33:12.047
No. No, he did not. This.

33:12.130 --> 33:14.508
What is that?

33:15.842 --> 33:18.303
- You'll see.
- That looks so good.

33:18.387 --> 33:20.597
This is how we do it in my culture.

33:27.896 --> 33:29.481
Here we go!

33:29.564 --> 33:31.566
Set, kid? Chet?

33:31.650 --> 33:33.568
Yes. I'm gonna make you pay!

33:33.652 --> 33:37.155
Good luck
cashing that check! Fight!

34:11.940 --> 34:13.608
The champion!

34:49.728 --> 34:53.774
Well, my boy, I'm gettin' more
and more impressed by you.

34:53.857 --> 34:56.650
You are becoming quite the animal.

34:56.735 --> 34:58.653
I hope you're spending this right?

34:58.737 --> 35:00.322
Hookers and booze.

35:00.405 --> 35:02.115
I'm saving it, actually.

35:03.116 --> 35:05.452
For what?

35:05.535 --> 35:10.040
My mother. She's stuck in Iran,
very sick. So...

35:10.123 --> 35:11.958
So you're saving it for ya sick mother?

35:13.794 --> 35:16.046
Wow! You are impressive.

35:17.047 --> 35:18.089
Here you go, Killer.

35:18.173 --> 35:19.382
Thanks.

35:19.466 --> 35:20.634
See you soon.

35:32.646 --> 35:33.855
Good boy.

35:37.859 --> 35:40.403
I don't want you to starve.

35:44.491 --> 35:46.368
Can you get a message to my mother?

35:49.204 --> 35:51.081
What do you want it to say?

37:02.903 --> 37:04.487
Shazam!

37:05.572 --> 37:07.449
- Hey, Ryan.
- Nah, shut up.

37:07.532 --> 37:10.535
- Take it. Just take it. It's for you.
- No. I don't feel right taking all this.

37:10.619 --> 37:12.996
- No, it's a lot of money.
- Please take it.

37:13.079 --> 37:14.331
I wanna help.

37:19.586 --> 37:20.462
Thank you.

37:21.463 --> 37:24.174
You're welcome, man.

37:28.720 --> 37:30.055
What do we have here?

37:31.306 --> 37:32.599
Ooh.

37:34.726 --> 37:36.227
I'd follow that, buddy.

37:43.568 --> 37:44.903
She is your girl.

37:45.904 --> 37:47.072
She's not my girl.

37:47.155 --> 37:48.365
Yeah. Okay.

37:48.448 --> 37:50.033
And I'm not all muscle.

38:34.828 --> 38:35.912
Hi.

38:41.042 --> 38:43.628
- I, uh, got your note.
- Oh, I see that.

38:44.629 --> 38:47.882
- You look nice.
- Why, thank you.

38:47.966 --> 38:51.970
So I bet you're wondering why I brought
you on this sweet little treasure hunt?

38:53.013 --> 38:56.433
Well, my sorority
is having their Fall Social,

38:56.516 --> 39:01.938
and Ryan is gonna take Becky,
so I was hoping that you would be my date.

39:05.066 --> 39:07.610
Hey, unless you have
somewhere better to be?

39:07.694 --> 39:09.446
- Oh. No, no. I would...
- Is everything okay?

39:09.529 --> 39:11.239
No, yes. Um, I would love to go.

39:12.240 --> 39:13.408
Great.

39:13.491 --> 39:15.785
Great. It's gonna be really, really fun.

39:15.869 --> 39:17.704
Okay. I gotta go. I'm gonna be late.

39:17.787 --> 39:19.539
- I'll see you later?
- Okay.

39:40.268 --> 39:43.271
Don't pay any attention
to that fancy crap. You hear me?

39:44.439 --> 39:46.524
You're fighting the house champ tonight.

39:50.278 --> 39:51.905
You think I'm afraid?

39:51.988 --> 39:54.699
Nobody said anything
about you being afraid.

40:01.706 --> 40:04.167
He's always had problems
with his right shoulder.

40:04.250 --> 40:06.586
Do with that what you will.

40:06.669 --> 40:08.129
Good luck, son.

40:15.553 --> 40:16.763
Yes!

40:18.056 --> 40:23.478
Ladies and gentlemen,
once again, "Iron" Ryan!

40:25.271 --> 40:26.731
Good fight, kid.

40:28.817 --> 40:31.820
Look, your opponent's big,
but you're faster. Use your speed.

40:31.903 --> 40:33.571
Got 200 on Jahani.
What do you got?

40:33.655 --> 40:34.823
Give me a hundred on Tank.

40:34.906 --> 40:38.451
Ladies and gentlemen,
do I ever disappoint?

40:38.535 --> 40:40.161
No! No!

40:40.245 --> 40:44.290
You come to my house,
and I show you some people who can fight.

40:44.374 --> 40:46.251
Yeah!

40:46.334 --> 40:48.378
We all know this kid.

40:50.130 --> 40:51.798
The little Arab over there.

40:51.881 --> 40:56.261
He reckons he can take anyone. Anyone!

40:57.637 --> 40:58.680
I'm wonderin',

40:58.763 --> 41:03.726
is there anyone we could think of
that could make him bleed?

41:03.810 --> 41:07.188
Tank. Tank. Tank. Tank. Tank.

41:14.028 --> 41:15.947
Stop!

41:17.198 --> 41:21.744
As usual, gentlemen,
we have to follow the rules.

41:21.828 --> 41:26.124
- Which are...
- No rules!

41:26.207 --> 41:27.625
Glad you remember.

41:27.709 --> 41:29.002
- Are you set?
- Set.

41:29.085 --> 41:30.712
- Tank?
- Yeah.

41:31.963 --> 41:33.006
Fight!

42:00.074 --> 42:01.367
Yeah!

42:01.451 --> 42:03.786
Tank! Tank! Tank!

42:05.288 --> 42:07.290
You gotta avoid him!

42:07.373 --> 42:08.708
Get out here, punk!

42:11.377 --> 42:14.422
Stay still and fight like a man,
monkey boy!

42:26.017 --> 42:28.019
Yeah!

42:31.648 --> 42:32.857
Mm-hmm.

42:34.234 --> 42:36.110
Get up! Get up, Ali!

42:57.090 --> 42:59.092
My shoulder! You broke my shoulder!

43:02.971 --> 43:04.430
My shoulder!

43:08.101 --> 43:11.771
You're unharmed? Wow. Wow.

43:15.024 --> 43:16.526
Ali, Ali, Ali!

43:20.905 --> 43:23.199
Yes! Take him!

43:42.010 --> 43:44.220
He's out, he's out!

43:51.060 --> 43:53.396
Wow! Wow!

43:53.479 --> 43:55.857
That was amazing.

43:55.940 --> 43:58.735
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...

44:00.278 --> 44:03.197
Ali!

44:04.198 --> 44:06.075
Wow, where did that come...

44:06.159 --> 44:07.160
What's that?

44:08.161 --> 44:09.370
It was my dad's.

44:10.371 --> 44:12.957
The lion. Look at this.

44:13.041 --> 44:14.917
- His father's.
- Yeah!

44:15.001 --> 44:18.421
The Young Lion! The Young Lion!

44:22.842 --> 44:26.429
- Amazing. Amazing. Good.
- Lion! Lion! Lion! Lion!

44:35.730 --> 44:38.983
Jesus, kid just knocked out Tank.

44:39.067 --> 44:42.320
I know.
I didn't see that one comin'.

44:42.403 --> 44:43.821
Neither did Tank.

44:43.905 --> 44:45.490
Yeah. Thanks.

44:45.573 --> 44:48.201
- Hey, boys.
- Oh, hey, good boys, how are you?

44:48.284 --> 44:49.660
Great fight, Ryan. Great fight.

44:49.744 --> 44:51.371
Thanks. Me? What about him?

44:51.454 --> 44:53.915
Ah, this guy... wow.

44:53.998 --> 44:56.542
He just knocked out Tank.

44:56.626 --> 44:58.628
Definitely didn't know he had it in him.

44:59.629 --> 45:01.714
Fiona, give us...
give me the special stuff.

45:01.798 --> 45:03.383
- Give me the Scotch.
- Got it.

45:03.466 --> 45:05.468
Or as we call it, whiskey.

45:05.551 --> 45:09.514
Three whiskeys.

45:09.597 --> 45:11.140
This is to you, son.

45:14.185 --> 45:15.603
Sláinte.

45:17.855 --> 45:19.107
Bravo.

45:22.068 --> 45:23.277
Well...

45:24.987 --> 45:28.825
Well, gentlemen,
I think it's time we step it up a notch.

45:28.908 --> 45:30.535
I got an opportunity for ya.

45:30.618 --> 45:35.164
One fight, you walk away with enough money
to look after your mama.

45:36.165 --> 45:40.044
All you gotta do is stay up
in the ring with this one guy.

45:40.128 --> 45:42.296
I know you've got a little stash.

45:42.380 --> 45:45.758
A little bit put away for your mama.

45:45.842 --> 45:48.010
I'll give you massive odds.

45:48.094 --> 45:49.554
You'll make a ton of money.

45:49.637 --> 45:50.805
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no, no.

45:50.888 --> 45:54.100
Hold on, no.
We're not putting any back in.

45:55.101 --> 45:56.936
That wasn't the plan.

45:57.019 --> 45:59.230
Win the fights, take the money, move on.

46:00.481 --> 46:01.816
We're not doing that.

46:03.526 --> 46:05.403
I thought you were family,
but you know what?

46:05.486 --> 46:07.780
Carry on. Walk away.
I'll see you next fight.

46:07.864 --> 46:08.906
Good luck.

46:10.908 --> 46:12.618
- See ya.
- Yeah.

46:13.619 --> 46:14.996
Thanks, Ryan.

46:20.251 --> 46:21.878
You know, I just don't know.
What do you think, Ali?

46:21.961 --> 46:25.673
What do you think?
Tropical rainforest, or, uh, snakeskin?

46:25.756 --> 46:26.966
I mean, they're both a good time.

46:27.049 --> 46:28.426
I don't know.

46:29.677 --> 46:31.762
Wow, thanks, man.
That was a big help.

46:31.846 --> 46:33.598
You look good too, by the way.
Appreciate it.

46:33.681 --> 46:34.974
Thanks.

46:40.688 --> 46:44.066
Uh, Ali? It's for you.

46:44.150 --> 46:46.819
Mr. V would like to speak to you.

46:50.490 --> 46:53.409
It's fine. Um, cover for me,
and I'll meet you at the social.

46:54.410 --> 46:56.078
Where is he?

46:56.162 --> 46:57.997
Hey, don't be late.

47:06.839 --> 47:08.716
Did you see this?

47:10.051 --> 47:11.719
The borders are sealed.

47:11.802 --> 47:13.513
The Basrij are everywhere.

47:18.476 --> 47:19.977
We must act now.

47:21.270 --> 47:22.813
If there is any hope.

47:23.940 --> 47:25.608
Do you have the rest of the money?

47:25.691 --> 47:27.568
Not all of it, no.

47:27.652 --> 47:29.362
And when will you have it?

47:29.445 --> 47:31.155
At least a week.

47:31.239 --> 47:33.199
Late. Too late.

47:33.282 --> 47:34.617
No, it can't be too late.

47:34.700 --> 47:36.327
Look at what's happening, man.

47:36.410 --> 47:38.246
My contacts might be dead already.

47:38.329 --> 47:41.374
Yeah, but there's got to be something
we can do. Don't tell me that.

47:43.251 --> 47:48.464
If you get the money in the next few days,
there might be a chance.

47:48.548 --> 47:49.882
Otherwise...

47:51.384 --> 47:52.760
I don't know what to say.

48:06.315 --> 48:08.276
Looks like you got a visitor.

48:09.777 --> 48:11.487
I'll give you a minute.

48:14.282 --> 48:15.908
What's up, son?

48:15.992 --> 48:17.243
Can you still set up the extra fight?

48:18.661 --> 48:20.413
The fight you said was too risky?

48:20.496 --> 48:21.998
I changed my mind.

48:24.458 --> 48:25.876
Unfortunately for you,

48:25.960 --> 48:29.839
the gentleman that runs these fights
has cancelled the bout.

48:32.258 --> 48:37.263
Tell you what.
These guys, they love an incentive.

48:37.346 --> 48:40.224
So if you've got anything,
then maybe it will sweeten our pot.

48:40.308 --> 48:43.269
How's 7,500,
and the fight is tomorrow night?

48:44.937 --> 48:47.732
Seventy-five? You've saved up.

48:52.903 --> 48:56.782
All right, take a seat.
I'm gonna call, see what I can do.

48:56.866 --> 48:59.243
Don't worry about it. I'll work this out.

49:14.383 --> 49:15.635
Hi, guys.

49:15.718 --> 49:17.053
- Look who's here!
- Hey!

49:39.241 --> 49:41.410
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

49:48.501 --> 49:51.420
- What can I get ya? All right.
- Vodka.

49:51.504 --> 49:52.588
Okay.

50:00.554 --> 50:03.849
- They took it?
- Yeah, of course. It's on!

50:03.933 --> 50:07.019
I just said "My champ needs a fight.
He needs it tomorrow night."

50:07.103 --> 50:09.730
And I've got Ryan in the first bout.

50:09.814 --> 50:12.525
You know? You got a fight, son!

50:12.608 --> 50:16.404
- Come on!
- That's worth celebrating.

50:21.492 --> 50:22.993
Uh, uh, uh.

50:24.245 --> 50:25.788
Slàinte.

50:28.374 --> 50:30.209
- Oops.
- To your mama.

50:32.586 --> 50:33.879
Cheers.

50:42.012 --> 50:43.431
Shit.

50:44.974 --> 50:46.726
What's your damage, man?

50:46.809 --> 50:48.728
Where the hell were you last night?

50:49.729 --> 50:50.855
Why are you so loud?

50:50.938 --> 50:53.315
Uh, because I'm pissed.

50:53.399 --> 50:55.359
Are you hungover right now?

50:55.443 --> 50:57.653
I don't know.
I think I'm still drunk.

50:57.737 --> 50:59.739
You stood up Heidi to get drunk?

50:59.822 --> 51:01.407
What, is that, like, your thing now?

51:01.490 --> 51:02.992
She's pissed!

51:04.785 --> 51:06.662
Isn't that what you
were wearing last night?

51:06.746 --> 51:09.790
No. Yeah.

51:09.874 --> 51:11.459
Don't change the subject on me.

51:11.542 --> 51:13.794
Where were you? What happened?

51:15.421 --> 51:17.715
I got McClellan to set up
a fight for tonight.

51:17.798 --> 51:20.342
No. No, no, no, no.

51:20.426 --> 51:23.179
Hey, please tell me
you did not take that deal.

51:23.262 --> 51:25.181
We were gonna stick to the plan, Ali.

51:25.264 --> 51:26.599
It's the same thing.
It's just an extra fight.

51:26.682 --> 51:28.225
No, it's not.
Do you understand that, Ali?

51:28.309 --> 51:31.187
Do you think I have a choice?

51:31.270 --> 51:33.022
Should I just let my mother die?

51:37.860 --> 51:40.696
No. No.

51:43.407 --> 51:46.202
I'm sorry. I just... it's a lot, man.

51:46.285 --> 51:48.162
I mean, you gotta...
you know, you gotta wrestle,

51:48.245 --> 51:50.080
and then you gotta jump in the ring.

51:50.164 --> 51:51.665
What about Heidi?

51:51.749 --> 51:53.793
I can't think about that right now.

51:55.336 --> 51:59.048
McClellan got you the opening bout
SO you can warm up the crowd.

51:59.131 --> 52:01.801
Well, that was nice of him.

52:01.884 --> 52:03.969
I need to vomit.

52:14.647 --> 52:15.898
- Come on, Jahani!
- Come on, Ali!

52:15.981 --> 52:17.900
- Do something!
- Come on, Jahani!

52:17.983 --> 52:19.819
You're not just embarrassing yourself,
you're embarrassing me.

52:19.902 --> 52:20.986
- Let's go.
- Come on, Ali.

52:22.363 --> 52:25.157
Show me something!

52:27.076 --> 52:28.410
Illegal move!

52:28.494 --> 52:30.538
What were you thinking?

52:30.621 --> 52:32.289
- How's that for something?
- What the hell's wrong with you?

52:32.373 --> 52:33.999
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I got him, coach. I got him.

52:34.083 --> 52:35.501
- Get him outta my sight!
- What are you doing?

52:36.502 --> 52:37.753
Are you all right?

52:48.430 --> 52:49.557
Dude, you're losing it.

52:50.558 --> 52:51.725
I'm fine!

53:19.837 --> 53:21.463
Yeah!

54:00.544 --> 54:04.548
"Iron" Ryan! Come on!

54:04.632 --> 54:07.718
Give the money.
Money, money, money. Gimme here.

54:07.801 --> 54:09.970
Shut up. Money.

54:19.271 --> 54:22.149
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I just need the tape.

54:32.451 --> 54:34.578
So what? No words of wisdom tonight?

54:43.003 --> 54:44.505
You're being set up, son.

54:44.588 --> 54:46.256
Yeah, how do you know?

54:46.340 --> 54:47.424
You know how I know?

54:47.508 --> 54:50.511
Because I look at you,
and I see a donkey.

54:50.594 --> 54:52.888
And they're puttin' you
against a racehorse.

54:52.972 --> 54:55.849
And I know that
because I used to be the racehorse,

54:55.933 --> 54:58.769
looking across the ring
at a bunch of donkeys

54:58.852 --> 55:02.982
just filled with confidence
and zero technique.

55:04.149 --> 55:06.235
And that's what I see right there.

55:06.318 --> 55:08.487
Yeah.

55:08.570 --> 55:11.448
Either way, I have no choice.
I have to fight.

55:12.449 --> 55:15.577
You always have a choice.
You don't need to get in that ring, son.

55:16.578 --> 55:17.621
Hey, Duke.

55:18.956 --> 55:20.541
What ya telling my boy here?

55:22.543 --> 55:24.336
Where you been?
I've been looking for you.

55:24.420 --> 55:25.754
He gonna be okay?

55:25.838 --> 55:28.799
This fellow? Yeah.

55:28.882 --> 55:32.011
Every night's Saturday night, right, Duke?

55:36.640 --> 55:37.850
So you got it?

55:43.397 --> 55:44.857
Do I need to count it?

55:44.940 --> 55:46.233
It's all of it.

55:47.776 --> 55:50.738
So, are you ready, young man? Huh?

55:50.821 --> 55:52.364
- Ready to roar?
- Mm-mm.

55:52.448 --> 55:55.325
The lion! Let's go piss them off.

55:55.409 --> 55:56.577
Go!

55:59.121 --> 56:00.164
Duke...

56:12.051 --> 56:14.803
Easy money, kid. Easy money.
Get in there. Kill him.

56:19.099 --> 56:22.895
Okay, gentlemen, tonight's main event.

56:22.978 --> 56:27.357
This young man here,
you know you all love to hate him.

56:27.441 --> 56:32.780
Well, he's gone toe to toe with everyone
that we've thrown out,

56:32.863 --> 56:34.823
and not one has taken him down.

56:36.533 --> 56:40.245
This young man has the heart of a lion.

56:40.329 --> 56:42.081
So let me hear you roar.

56:47.169 --> 56:49.963
I give you the Young Lion!

56:53.509 --> 56:56.220
Over here, the other contender,

56:56.303 --> 56:59.389
who's been waiting for a chance
to fight this young lion;

56:59.473 --> 57:01.225
bring him to his knees.

57:03.102 --> 57:07.689
The Muay Thai kickboxing champion,

57:07.773 --> 57:12.486
the Master of the Mountain,
the mighty Bas!

57:19.618 --> 57:20.911
Hey! Hey! Stop the fight!

57:20.994 --> 57:22.371
Ali, stop the fight. Now...

57:22.454 --> 57:23.747
- What?
- You cannot fight this guy, okay?

57:23.831 --> 57:25.124
- He's gonna kill you.
- Get rid of that clown.

57:25.207 --> 57:26.583
- I don't have a choice.
- Don't do it, Ali.

57:26.667 --> 57:27.918
- It's too late.
- Don't do it! Ali!

57:28.001 --> 57:29.878
This is your last chance
to put your bets on,

57:29.962 --> 57:32.506
and my money's on this boy.

57:32.589 --> 57:36.093
And if any of you have any action
that says otherwise,

57:36.176 --> 57:39.555
play it to me. I'll treat ya.

57:49.773 --> 57:51.400
All right, here we go.

57:57.197 --> 57:58.282
Bas?

57:58.365 --> 57:59.616
Let's go.

58:01.160 --> 58:02.077
Fight!

58:27.477 --> 58:28.770
That's it.

59:07.434 --> 59:08.644
Stay down.

59:09.645 --> 59:10.896
Stay down.

59:19.112 --> 59:20.822
Ali! Hey! Hey, buddy!

59:20.906 --> 59:23.617
Give it up for the mighty Bas!

59:25.035 --> 59:26.328
A true champ!

59:28.163 --> 59:30.123
Ali? Ali?
Wake up, buddy. Come on.

59:30.207 --> 59:32.376
- Come on.
- How's he doing?

59:32.459 --> 59:34.544
You set him up! You piece of shit!

59:36.672 --> 59:38.548
You piece of shit!

59:38.632 --> 59:39.841
Shit!

59:41.593 --> 59:43.303
Hey, hey, hey.

59:49.476 --> 59:50.769
That was a mistake, kid.

59:54.398 --> 59:55.357
Have at him.

01:00:10.372 --> 01:00:12.457
Hey! Back off!

01:00:15.168 --> 01:00:18.422
I swear to God, I'll snap it
if you don't get your boys outta here.

01:00:20.215 --> 01:00:22.050
- Now!
- Back off! Back off! Back off!

01:00:22.134 --> 01:00:23.260
Enough! Enough, enough.

01:00:30.267 --> 01:00:32.477
Take a big breath, buddy.

01:00:33.854 --> 01:00:35.272
You're gonna be all right.

01:00:40.110 --> 01:00:42.154
Tell me, how many fingers I got up?

01:00:42.237 --> 01:00:43.905
None. I-I have to talk to McClellan.

01:00:43.989 --> 01:00:47.409
No, you don't need to talk to McClellan
about anything, son.

01:00:47.492 --> 01:00:49.244
He took ya.

01:00:49.328 --> 01:00:52.456
Had you swinging above your weight class
and your skill class.

01:00:52.539 --> 01:00:54.916
No way you were gonna win that fight.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.376
What are you talking about?

01:00:56.460 --> 01:01:00.630
You have any idea who the guy was
across the ring from you?

01:01:01.631 --> 01:01:02.591
No.

01:01:02.674 --> 01:01:04.760
Well, see, that's a problem.

01:01:04.843 --> 01:01:07.179
Anybody with a shot in hell
of defeating that guy

01:01:07.262 --> 01:01:10.390
knows exactly who he is,
what his skill set is,

01:01:10.474 --> 01:01:13.226
and what they need to train for
to defeat it.

01:01:13.310 --> 01:01:16.021
Now, see,
that ain't you right now, son.

01:01:16.104 --> 01:01:17.105
That doesn't matter.

01:01:17.189 --> 01:01:18.857
- I have to get the money.
- Sit down!

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:22.486
You're not gonna get a dime
outta McClellan for a bet you lost.

01:01:22.569 --> 01:01:25.238
You need to start
making more calculated bets,

01:01:25.322 --> 01:01:28.033
taking less random risks with your life.

01:01:32.621 --> 01:01:36.166
What I need you to do
is get yourself cleaned up.

01:01:36.249 --> 01:01:37.918
Let's get to the hospital.

01:01:41.338 --> 01:01:43.215
Hospital? You said I was fine.

01:01:44.591 --> 01:01:46.134
It ain't for you, son.

01:01:53.433 --> 01:01:55.644
Hey-hey, I'm looking for Ryan Caulder.

01:01:55.727 --> 01:01:57.521
Oh, we are way past visiting hours.

01:01:57.604 --> 01:01:58.647
You can come back at 10:00 AM.

01:02:00.982 --> 01:02:02.776
Ten AM? That's tomorrow.

01:02:02.859 --> 01:02:04.152
Just-just tell me which room he's in.

01:02:05.153 --> 01:02:06.780
Do I need to call security?

01:02:06.863 --> 01:02:08.782
Ten AM.

01:02:08.865 --> 01:02:10.575
Well, can I at least wait here?

01:02:11.576 --> 01:02:13.453
Knock yourself out.

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:37.996
I'm so sorry, man.

01:03:40.415 --> 01:03:42.042
I don't know what happened.

01:03:44.503 --> 01:03:47.589
I don't know what I'm gonna do,
but I-I promise I will fix this.

01:03:58.141 --> 01:03:59.726
You lied to me.

01:04:01.978 --> 01:04:05.023
I trusted you, and you lied to me.

01:04:05.106 --> 01:04:09.486
And of all of the just moronic...
Illegal fighting?

01:04:09.569 --> 01:04:12.405
Ali, really? Why?
Why would you be so stupid?

01:04:12.489 --> 01:04:15.534
- You don't understand.
- No, I think... I think I understand it.

01:04:15.617 --> 01:04:18.161
Tell me, is it...
is it the thrill that you liked?

01:04:18.245 --> 01:04:20.789
Is it just punching
random people in the face?

01:04:20.872 --> 01:04:24.584
I don't know, but please tell me why for
one second, one second in all of this,

01:04:24.668 --> 01:04:29.005
you didn't stop and think about anybody
other than yourself.

01:04:29.089 --> 01:04:33.677
You didn't! And now Ryan
is lying in a hospital bed, Ali.

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.053
Tell me that none of this is your...

01:04:35.136 --> 01:04:38.515
Excuse me. There is no yelling in here.
You're going to have to leave.

01:04:39.558 --> 01:04:42.602
No, it's fine. It's fine. It's...

01:04:45.814 --> 01:04:47.857
I think that we are done here.

01:05:44.164 --> 01:05:45.206
Hey!

01:05:46.374 --> 01:05:48.168
What the hell are you doing here, son?

01:05:48.251 --> 01:05:49.586
Getting my money back.

01:05:49.669 --> 01:05:51.463
Oh, is that right?

01:05:51.546 --> 01:05:53.131
And what are you gonna do if you don't?

01:05:53.214 --> 01:05:55.508
Are you gonna go shoot him?

01:05:55.592 --> 01:05:58.219
'Cause I'll tell you something, son,
you leave him breathin'?

01:05:58.303 --> 01:06:02.682
He'll track you down,
he'll crush you like a fuckin' cockroach.

01:06:02.766 --> 01:06:05.060
The hell is wrong with you, son?
There's better ways.

01:06:05.143 --> 01:06:06.394
Better ways? What better ways?

01:06:06.478 --> 01:06:08.730
Oh, the cops?
Are they gonna believe someone like me?

01:06:08.813 --> 01:06:10.732
Oh, knock off the woe is me crap.

01:06:10.815 --> 01:06:14.361
Blame makes you weak, son. Go home!

01:06:14.444 --> 01:06:16.571
Learn to translate
your wrestlin' into fightin',

01:06:16.655 --> 01:06:18.156
train with somebody
that knows the damn difference.

01:06:18.239 --> 01:06:20.867
Train? Train for what?
She's probably dead now!

01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:23.453
And you're gonna die too
if you don't get out of my way!

01:06:26.915 --> 01:06:28.917
Let me ask you somethin', son.

01:06:32.337 --> 01:06:37.300
You ever thought about putting that
on a skull and pulling the trigger?

01:06:37.384 --> 01:06:40.387
You ever thought about it'?
'Cause I have.

01:06:41.388 --> 01:06:43.598
I've thought about it a lot.

01:06:43.682 --> 01:06:46.768
I've thought about it more than
you can possibly imagine.

01:06:46.851 --> 01:06:51.439
It just takes a little squeeze,
and I'll walk you through it.

01:06:51.523 --> 01:06:55.652
Squeeze it! You squeeze it!

01:06:55.735 --> 01:06:57.278
Squeeze it, you pussy!

01:06:57.362 --> 01:06:58.571
Squeeze it! Squeeze it!

01:07:09.666 --> 01:07:11.334
It's my fault. I killed her.

01:07:11.418 --> 01:07:14.170
- No. No, son.
- I killed her.

01:07:14.254 --> 01:07:16.464
I killed her. I killed her.

01:07:17.966 --> 01:07:18.967
Listen to me...

01:07:19.968 --> 01:07:22.137
And now, Ryan's in the hospital.

01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:25.265
You're just drunk right now.
I-I-I should know it.

01:07:25.348 --> 01:07:27.600
It's my fault.

01:07:48.496 --> 01:07:51.166
Hey! Wake up.

01:07:55.503 --> 01:07:57.881
What am I doing here?

01:07:57.964 --> 01:08:00.884
You're doing anything you want here, son.
You be stayin' or you be goin'.

01:08:05.305 --> 01:08:08.641
I can't believe I lost all the money.

01:08:08.725 --> 01:08:10.935
You should know better
than to take a loser's bet.

01:08:11.019 --> 01:08:13.688
The good news is, next fight
you're in charge of your own over/under.

01:08:13.772 --> 01:08:15.607
Next fight? What... what do you know?

01:08:15.690 --> 01:08:19.027
You're a drunk. Is-is this your house?
Is this where you live?

01:08:19.109 --> 01:08:21.654
Get your hand off the box!
It's not your property!

01:08:26.785 --> 01:08:29.412
My father
thought we could have a better life.

01:08:29.496 --> 01:08:32.040
He was wrong.

01:08:32.122 --> 01:08:35.292
This is the United States of America, son.
Your father was right.

01:08:35.376 --> 01:08:38.671
You got enough character and work ethic,
you're willing to fight for something,

01:08:38.755 --> 01:08:40.506
you get anything you want in this life.

01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:43.426
It's moments like this
that define winners and losers.

01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:45.553
But you gotta look in the mirror
and be honest to yourself

01:08:45.636 --> 01:08:47.388
which one of those you are.

01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:56.898
Look, I understand you want to change
the outcome of last night's fight,

01:08:56.981 --> 01:09:02.487
but you gotta change yourself first,
and I can show you exactly what to do.

01:09:02.569 --> 01:09:05.113
But you gotta stand up
and do the walkin' yourself.

01:09:25.009 --> 01:09:26.301
I want you to train me.

01:09:27.303 --> 01:09:30.055
Yeah?

01:09:49.533 --> 01:09:52.036
- What are you doing here?
- I want you to give Ali another fight.

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:55.957
And why would I do that?

01:09:58.209 --> 01:10:01.629
I like the kid, he was good for business.

01:10:01.713 --> 01:10:05.174
But it was just time for that little Arab
to be put in his place.

01:10:06.718 --> 01:10:10.513
Of course. That's your MO, right?

01:10:12.891 --> 01:10:16.269
So you're still full of piss and vinegar
about the knee?

01:10:16.352 --> 01:10:19.147
'Cause I had nothing to do with that.

01:10:19.230 --> 01:10:20.773
Nothing.

01:10:20.857 --> 01:10:24.027
And I'm sorry what happened
to your son, I truly am.

01:10:25.028 --> 01:10:26.487
But that's on you.

01:10:26.571 --> 01:10:28.865
That's on you and the booze.

01:10:28.948 --> 01:10:31.200
Everything we did together was business...

01:10:32.201 --> 01:10:33.369
never personal.

01:10:33.453 --> 01:10:35.204
Well, here's some business for you then.

01:10:37.081 --> 01:10:41.044
It's ten grand on the kid
in a rematch against Bas.

01:10:41.127 --> 01:10:43.880
Wow. Against Bas?

01:10:47.467 --> 01:10:50.303
Ten grand, that's a lot of money.

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:54.349
You been robbing liquor stores?

01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:02.523
All right.

01:11:02.607 --> 01:11:06.194
We know the kid can fight
with an average fighter.

01:11:06.277 --> 01:11:08.321
You put him in there with a real fighter,

01:11:08.404 --> 01:11:12.492
and our little fella
is gonna get smashed to bits.

01:11:12.575 --> 01:11:14.035
How do I get someone to bet on that?

01:11:14.118 --> 01:11:16.746
There's plenty of people that would bet
on it depending on what the odds are.

01:11:16.829 --> 01:11:20.416
Hell, you're the maker.
Why don't you tell me?

01:11:26.214 --> 01:11:27.882
- Seven to one.
- No.

01:11:27.966 --> 01:11:29.884
It was ten to one last time.
Everybody saw what happened.

01:11:29.968 --> 01:11:31.260
It's gotta be better than that.

01:11:31.344 --> 01:11:34.514
If I do any better than that,
then I don't make any money.

01:11:34.597 --> 01:11:37.225
And if I don't make any money,
I'm not happy.

01:11:38.768 --> 01:11:41.646
Well, I think you'd be happy
if you moved it to a bigger venue.

01:11:41.729 --> 01:11:44.649
I got a buddy at the shipyard.
Got a huge warehouse there.

01:11:44.732 --> 01:11:46.901
I've already spoken to him.
Build a ring inside.

01:11:48.945 --> 01:11:51.406
You pack that place,
you'll have 100,000 in bets easy.

01:11:53.449 --> 01:11:56.160
And what is in this for you?

01:12:00.081 --> 01:12:04.043
Well, I guess I'm still just full
of piss and vinegar over the knee.

01:12:04.127 --> 01:12:06.879
Hell, I just can't seem to let that go.

01:12:06.963 --> 01:12:09.841
Give me 12 to one
and a month to train him, you got a fight.

01:12:13.302 --> 01:12:14.679
Twelve to one.

01:12:18.016 --> 01:12:19.308
All right.

01:12:20.309 --> 01:12:21.686
I'll give you your odds.

01:12:22.687 --> 01:12:24.480
- But you only get two weeks...
- Done.

01:12:24.564 --> 01:12:25.565
Done?

01:12:28.234 --> 01:12:30.570
Oh, uh, just one more thing.

01:12:30.653 --> 01:12:33.531
If anything happens to Ali
before the fight...

01:12:35.116 --> 01:12:37.035
just know I'm coming back here.

01:12:38.745 --> 01:12:40.663
I expect nothing less.

01:12:44.375 --> 01:12:45.626
Hello?

01:12:45.710 --> 01:12:47.003
Mr. V, it's me.

01:12:47.086 --> 01:12:49.756
Ali? Thank God.

01:12:49.839 --> 01:12:52.341
<i>I was worried. What happened to you?</i>

01:12:52.425 --> 01:12:54.427
I've been calling you since yesterday.

01:12:54.510 --> 01:12:56.137
<i>I know. I'm sorry. How is she?</i>

01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:57.513
Have you heard from her?

01:12:57.597 --> 01:13:00.808
I got your mother
to a safe place for now.

01:13:00.892 --> 01:13:06.564
<i>But she's, uh, gotten worse,
and needs Western medicine soon.</i>

01:13:06.647 --> 01:13:08.191
<i>You get it?</i>

01:13:10.902 --> 01:13:12.278
Ali?

01:13:19.994 --> 01:13:21.245
Okay.

01:13:22.789 --> 01:13:24.165
Two things:

01:13:24.248 --> 01:13:25.750
Number one, obviously you're a wrestler,

01:13:25.833 --> 01:13:27.794
which means you already
understand position.

01:13:27.877 --> 01:13:30.379
Now, let's teach you
to be dangerous from there.

01:13:30.463 --> 01:13:34.759
Number two, you give me everything
you have inside this ring of hay.

01:13:36.010 --> 01:13:37.428
We have an understanding?

01:13:40.765 --> 01:13:43.976
Outside hand, my lead leg,
coming straight up,

01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:48.689
straight down and around.
Gable Grip. Engage.

01:13:48.773 --> 01:13:49.899
Yeah. Okay.

01:13:49.982 --> 01:13:50.983
- Try it?
- Yeah.

01:13:55.363 --> 01:13:56.823
No, no, no, no.

01:13:56.906 --> 01:13:58.866
From the ground back to the floor.

01:13:58.950 --> 01:14:00.159
Rotate that foot.

01:14:00.243 --> 01:14:03.037
Harder! Harder! Elbow in!

01:14:03.121 --> 01:14:04.372
Step back.

01:14:07.959 --> 01:14:10.002
Next, I want a big step out,

01:14:10.086 --> 01:14:12.797
drive my own wrist
to the back of my head.

01:14:23.224 --> 01:14:25.810
You know, the only way
that ballerina crap's gonna work

01:14:25.893 --> 01:14:27.687
is if you catch him not lookin' at you.

01:14:29.397 --> 01:14:32.483
Which is highly unlikely.

01:14:40.616 --> 01:14:42.743
Step and rotate! Step and rotate!

01:14:45.454 --> 01:14:46.539
Okay!

01:14:49.125 --> 01:14:50.585
Yeah!

01:15:26.704 --> 01:15:28.456
Head down! Head down!

01:15:28.539 --> 01:15:30.833
Thirty seconds left!
Thirty seconds left, finish strong!

01:15:31.834 --> 01:15:32.960
Yeah!

01:15:33.044 --> 01:15:34.462
Jab, cross, elbow!

01:15:34.545 --> 01:15:36.631
Yeah! Jab, cross, elbow, elbow.

01:15:39.425 --> 01:15:41.302
Harder! Harder!

01:15:43.888 --> 01:15:46.057
Jab, cross, elbow. Yeah!

01:16:04.867 --> 01:16:07.370
- He said you can come in now.
- Thanks.

01:16:13.584 --> 01:16:15.628
Hey, you look like crap.

01:16:17.171 --> 01:16:20.967
Well, when 900 years old you reach,

01:16:21.050 --> 01:16:23.886
look as good you will not.

01:16:23.970 --> 01:16:27.974
- Still practicing the voice, huh?
- Damn, that was a good one.

01:16:29.267 --> 01:16:30.685
Can you watch the movies, please?

01:16:30.768 --> 01:16:33.104
I've told you like a million times
to watch 'em.

01:16:33.187 --> 01:16:35.773
You must hate me.

01:16:36.899 --> 01:16:38.359
Why?

01:16:38.442 --> 01:16:41.570
'Cause you lied to me
and you lost all our money?

01:16:41.654 --> 01:16:44.907
Yeah, I mean, you haven't even
asked how I'm doing yet?

01:16:44.991 --> 01:16:46.200
Yeah, I do kind of hate you.

01:16:47.201 --> 01:16:48.202
Ryan, I'm sorry.

01:16:48.286 --> 01:16:50.037
I bet you are.

01:16:51.831 --> 01:16:53.332
How's your mom doing?

01:16:54.667 --> 01:16:56.585
She's safe for now.

01:16:56.669 --> 01:17:00.423
But I have one chance to get her back,
so I'm fighting Bas again.

01:17:00.506 --> 01:17:02.466
What?

01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:04.135
That's a terrible idea, Ali.

01:17:04.218 --> 01:17:06.137
No, I... it-it's gonna work.

01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:08.514
Duke set the whole thing up,
and he's been training me.

01:17:08.597 --> 01:17:10.558
He's actually very good at fighting.

01:17:11.559 --> 01:17:13.686
- Duke?
- Yeah.

01:17:16.856 --> 01:17:18.649
Well, that's kinda cool, actually.

01:17:18.733 --> 01:17:21.402
He's like your, uh, Kenobi.

01:17:21.485 --> 01:17:23.321
I don't know who that is.

01:17:23.404 --> 01:17:25.948
Well, then watch the movie.

01:17:26.032 --> 01:17:27.700
Oh, man.

01:17:34.206 --> 01:17:36.208
Hey. Thanks for all the help, Duke.

01:17:36.292 --> 01:17:38.961
- Mm.
- I appreciate it.

01:17:41.464 --> 01:17:43.591
You know, I've actually enjoyed myself.

01:17:47.553 --> 01:17:49.221
Here, take this.

01:17:50.264 --> 01:17:51.682
It's a letter for my mom.

01:17:52.683 --> 01:17:56.020
Just in case anything
happens to me in the fight.

01:17:56.103 --> 01:17:58.981
There is instructions on how
to get it to her in there.

01:17:59.065 --> 01:18:00.316
Right.

01:18:02.777 --> 01:18:05.404
Well, I will put that in my pocket.

01:18:07.365 --> 01:18:10.368
But it's up to you
whether or not it stays there. Yeah?

01:18:20.044 --> 01:18:22.004
Why did you stop fighting?

01:18:27.301 --> 01:18:31.639
'Bout three days before my last fight,
they caught me coming out of McClellan's.

01:18:31.722 --> 01:18:33.224
Held me down in the parking lot,

01:18:33.307 --> 01:18:35.518
propped my leg up against
the concrete parking barrier,

01:18:35.601 --> 01:18:37.728
hyperextended it about 35 degrees.

01:18:37.812 --> 01:18:39.939
Took three of the sons of bitches.

01:18:41.857 --> 01:18:45.528
McClellan said
he didn't have a clue.

01:18:45.611 --> 01:18:47.738
But-but you still took the fight?

01:18:49.907 --> 01:18:52.701
Every dime to my name,
I placed on my victory.

01:18:53.828 --> 01:18:55.246
I didn't have a choice.

01:18:55.329 --> 01:18:57.540
Then where did you get the money for me?

01:19:01.127 --> 01:19:03.754
I got that money
from my son's college fund.

01:19:10.052 --> 01:19:12.221
Did he not go to college?

01:19:15.599 --> 01:19:17.059
He did not.

01:19:18.894 --> 01:19:21.230
I was going about 75 miles an hour
down the freeway.

01:19:21.313 --> 01:19:22.773
I had way too much to drink.

01:19:22.857 --> 01:19:24.525
He was standing up in
the front seat right next to me.

01:19:24.608 --> 01:19:26.610
I fell asleep, I hit a tree.

01:19:26.694 --> 01:19:27.695
The impact woke me up.

01:19:28.696 --> 01:19:30.072
He wasn't there anymore.

01:19:34.952 --> 01:19:38.497
I'd appreciate it if you'd
shut the bag and keep it shut.

01:19:56.891 --> 01:20:00.478
Everything you need
to defeat Bas is inside of you.

01:20:00.561 --> 01:20:02.980
It's up to you whether or not
you take it out or not.

01:20:04.732 --> 01:20:07.401
You didn't have the tools
to beat him the last time.

01:20:07.485 --> 01:20:09.403
But they're in there now.

01:20:10.488 --> 01:20:12.198
I promise you, they're in there.

01:20:13.449 --> 01:20:15.284
You got a second chance, kid.

01:20:17.161 --> 01:20:19.163
Not everybody gets one of those.

01:20:24.001 --> 01:20:26.045
And it's iced tea, by the way.

01:20:41.227 --> 01:20:42.436
Hey, what's up?

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:44.188
This just came for you.

01:20:58.410 --> 01:21:00.287
Bet you thought this would work,
didn't you?

01:21:00.371 --> 01:21:01.455
Heidi, please let me...

01:21:01.539 --> 01:21:05.042
Lucky for you, Ryan told me everything.

01:21:06.043 --> 01:21:08.212
Your mom, Ali.

01:21:08.295 --> 01:21:10.130
My God, you should've said
something to me.

01:21:10.214 --> 01:21:11.507
I know. I know that I should have.

01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:13.133
And you shouldn't have lied to me.

01:21:13.217 --> 01:21:15.594
I don't know what it was like
with all your other little girlfriends,

01:21:15.678 --> 01:21:17.054
but with me, that does not fly.

01:21:17.137 --> 01:21:19.265
No, of course, of course.
I know I shouldn't have lied, and...

01:21:19.348 --> 01:21:22.851
Look, I know now that I have friends,
and I don't have to do this alone.

01:21:24.144 --> 01:21:27.147
That is, if you'll have me as a friend.

01:21:27.231 --> 01:21:29.858
I know I don't deserve it,
and I know I screwed everything up.

01:21:29.942 --> 01:21:31.777
Okay! Shh, shh, shh.

01:21:36.198 --> 01:21:37.700
Have you ever played golf?

01:21:39.618 --> 01:21:41.287
No.

01:21:41.370 --> 01:21:43.664
Okay. In golf, there's a Mulligan.

01:21:43.747 --> 01:21:47.167
When you mess up a shot,
you get a do-over and you can try again.

01:21:48.627 --> 01:21:50.129
A do-over.

01:21:52.214 --> 01:21:53.841
I like the sound of that.

01:21:55.342 --> 01:21:56.844
Oh, and one more thing.

01:22:02.308 --> 01:22:04.935
Go out there and kick his ass.

01:22:05.019 --> 01:22:07.896
Give me two... Give me 250...
Give me 250 on Bas.

01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:11.942
On Bas. You got it. Here you go.

01:22:16.655 --> 01:22:18.907
It ain't no fight.

01:22:18.991 --> 01:22:20.743
It's a war!

01:22:21.744 --> 01:22:23.579
That's the Lion.

01:22:23.662 --> 01:22:27.625
This has nothing to do with strength,
power, or any of that crap.

01:22:27.708 --> 01:22:29.501
It's a simple equation
of who wants the most.

01:22:29.585 --> 01:22:31.337
Got it. Don't worry.

01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:35.549
It's the land of opportunity, kid,
and yours is just inside that ring.

01:22:35.633 --> 01:22:37.551
Time for the main event.

01:22:38.636 --> 01:22:41.847
And over here, the challenger.

01:22:41.930 --> 01:22:45.476
The young man from the sands
has returned!

01:22:47.019 --> 01:22:51.231
Youngest challenger ever

01:22:52.358 --> 01:22:55.819
to be the bare-knuckle champion
of Northern Cali

01:22:55.903 --> 01:23:00.366
until he was brought
to his knees by the mighty Bas.

01:23:03.452 --> 01:23:07.122
Apparently, he's grew a set.

01:23:08.290 --> 01:23:09.958
Let's see what you got, son.

01:23:10.042 --> 01:23:11.543
I give you...

01:23:12.961 --> 01:23:15.339
Ali Baghdad!

01:23:21.762 --> 01:23:27.101
This man here, the honorable,
the mighty Bas!

01:23:35.818 --> 01:23:38.153
Ready for the fight?

01:23:38.237 --> 01:23:44.910
Over here, we have the Persian kitty cat
versus the tiger.

01:23:46.578 --> 01:23:47.663
Set?

01:23:49.957 --> 01:23:51.500
Bas, you set, baby?

01:23:51.583 --> 01:23:52.793
Yeah.

01:23:52.876 --> 01:23:54.044
Good man.

01:23:58.424 --> 01:23:59.383
Fight!

01:24:17.443 --> 01:24:18.736
Move, Ali! Move!

01:24:18.819 --> 01:24:19.862
- Come on, Ali!
- Move!

01:24:19.945 --> 01:24:21.238
Come on!

01:24:39.339 --> 01:24:40.466
- Come on.
- There you go.

01:24:42.426 --> 01:24:44.762
Ali! Ali! Away from the power hand!

01:24:58.692 --> 01:24:59.943
Pull out of the clinch!

01:25:17.795 --> 01:25:18.629
Come on!

01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:27.346
Get up, Ali! Get up, buddy!

01:25:27.429 --> 01:25:28.555
Ali!

01:25:34.895 --> 01:25:36.188
Ali!

01:26:23.861 --> 01:26:25.362
Ali! Get up!

01:26:25.445 --> 01:26:26.905
Stay down.

01:26:33.954 --> 01:26:34.872
Yes!

01:26:38.458 --> 01:26:41.461
This is your moment!
This is your time!

01:26:43.672 --> 01:26:45.507
Time to put your ass to sleep.

01:26:57.895 --> 01:26:58.979
Drop!

01:27:00.772 --> 01:27:01.773
- Yeah!
- Yes!

01:27:08.238 --> 01:27:09.865
- Come on!
- Get up.

01:27:09.948 --> 01:27:10.908
Come on.

01:27:13.035 --> 01:27:15.329
Get up! Get up!

01:27:15.412 --> 01:27:17.414
Ali! Ali! Get up! He's not looking!

01:27:21.627 --> 01:27:22.878
Yes!

01:27:43.857 --> 01:27:45.275
The back, Ali! Take the back!

01:27:49.780 --> 01:27:50.989
Yeah!

01:27:51.073 --> 01:27:53.367
Yes! Bring it! Under the chin!

01:27:56.453 --> 01:27:57.621
Yes, Ali! Yes!

01:28:05.170 --> 01:28:06.880
- Come on, come on.
- Come on, come on!

01:28:11.385 --> 01:28:13.679
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

01:28:16.515 --> 01:28:17.975
You did it, son.

01:28:18.058 --> 01:28:20.394
Son of a bitch, you did it!

01:28:20.477 --> 01:28:23.105
- I'm proud of you.
- We did it! We did it!

01:28:23.188 --> 01:28:24.731
Damn, I'm so proud of you!

01:28:27.985 --> 01:28:29.653
I knew you could do it!

01:28:29.736 --> 01:28:31.029
We did it!

01:28:32.030 --> 01:28:36.868
- You did it!
- Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali!

01:28:36.952 --> 01:28:39.997
- Here's the kid's money plus your 20.
- Yeah. Better be all there.

01:28:40.998 --> 01:28:44.376
Let's go. Watch my back.

01:28:44.459 --> 01:28:47.295
Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali!

01:29:06.815 --> 01:29:10.569
My companions are ex-Special Forces.

01:29:10.652 --> 01:29:14.281
Don't hold it against your men.
They never had a chance.

01:29:15.824 --> 01:29:17.659
Wow, Benjamin.

01:29:19.036 --> 01:29:20.746
Ain't you a clever boy?

01:29:20.829 --> 01:29:22.998
Put the bag down, McClellan.

01:29:25.167 --> 01:29:27.210
See, the thing is...

01:29:29.504 --> 01:29:32.090
some of this shit belongs to me.

01:29:32.174 --> 01:29:35.093
I don't need the use of both of my legs
to make you, and you know that.

01:29:54.529 --> 01:29:56.865
Consider the extra my severance.

01:30:04.831 --> 01:30:06.541
I'll see you after.

01:30:07.959 --> 01:30:10.045
I expect nothing less.

01:30:23.809 --> 01:30:26.603
I am so excited.
My heart is vibrating in my shirt.

01:30:40.742 --> 01:30:42.828
That's it. She's not coming.

01:30:42.911 --> 01:30:45.372
God! Where is she?

01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:48.333
She may be on a different flight.

01:30:48.416 --> 01:30:51.128
- No.
- You don't know.

01:30:51.211 --> 01:30:52.754
Ali Jaan!

01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:01.138
Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:31:01.221 --> 01:31:02.264
- Mama!
- It's okay.

01:31:02.347 --> 01:31:05.058
- Mama!
- It's his mother. Go! Yes! Yes!

01:31:06.518 --> 01:31:08.228
I told you I'd get you here.

01:33:05.470 --> 01:33:06.388
Huh.

01:33:06.471 --> 01:33:08.098
- Oh, pretty good.
- That's right.

01:33:08.181 --> 01:33:11.935
Okay, guys. Let's get a room. Here.

01:33:12.018 --> 01:33:15.480
Don't act like I don't know
Becky's been playing your nursemaid.

01:33:15.563 --> 01:33:16.773
- Mm-mm.
- Nursemaid, huh?

01:33:16.856 --> 01:33:18.108
You should not know that.

01:33:18.191 --> 01:33:19.567
- I do.
- Well, we have the costume so...

01:33:19.651 --> 01:33:21.111
What you talking about?

01:33:21.194 --> 01:33:22.904
Okay, guys.

01:33:22.988 --> 01:33:27.117
Do you realize for this
how many asses I had to...

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:29.202
- Kick.
- Kiss.

01:33:29.286 --> 01:33:30.495
- Ohh.
- Mwah.

01:33:30.578 --> 01:33:31.913
Okay, whatever. Just put it in.

01:33:31.997 --> 01:33:33.915
Okay. Hush.

01:33:33.999 --> 01:33:35.583
This movie's
gonna change your life.

01:33:35.667 --> 01:33:37.544
- Enjoy the show.
- Thank you.

01:33:37.627 --> 01:33:40.255
- He is so cute.
- Dude, I'm so excited!

01:33:40.338 --> 01:33:43.633
- This movie's so good.
- <i>Star Wars.</i>

01:33:48.555 --> 01:33:52.851
Wait, a long time ago,
but in a galaxy far, far away?

01:33:53.852 --> 01:33:55.437
<i>I don't get it.</i>

01:33:57.223 --> 01:34:02.223
