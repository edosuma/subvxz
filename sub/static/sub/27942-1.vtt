as I can take you.

[melancholy music]

03:59.377 --> 04:00.378
- Yes?

04:00.412 --> 04:01.896
- I was given this address.

04:20.087 --> 04:22.917
- Always nice to have
a new face around here.

04:22.952 --> 04:24.298
My name is Paula.

04:24.333 --> 04:25.161
- Mary.

04:26.335 --> 04:27.750
- All who come to this convent

04:27.784 --> 04:30.822
must leave behind their
former life and possessions.

04:30.856 --> 04:32.617
If this is a problem,
the door is there

04:32.651 --> 04:35.309
for you to return
that which you fled.

04:35.344 --> 04:36.206
- No.

04:37.346 --> 04:39.175
- If and when you
decide to leave us,

04:39.209 --> 04:41.281
your possessions will
be returned to you.

04:42.765 --> 04:44.801
We operate under a
strict vow of silence.

04:48.909 --> 04:50.635
This keeps us free
from distraction

04:50.669 --> 04:54.224
and closer to the Lord.
[light humming]

04:55.536 --> 04:58.608
We have prayer at five
am, breakfast at seven,

04:58.643 --> 05:00.369
chores until 10.

05:00.403 --> 05:01.784
You can expect to start out--

05:01.818 --> 05:03.958
- [Mary] Hi, what
are you reading?

05:03.993 --> 05:05.822
- [Paula] You don't
need to do that.

05:05.857 --> 05:07.514
You'll find it doesn't matter

05:07.548 --> 05:09.032
if anyone in here likes you.

05:09.067 --> 05:11.172
- [Narrator] Look at her
when she's talking to you.

05:11.207 --> 05:12.035
- Where is she?

05:20.975 --> 05:24.634
- Mother's approval is all you
should concern yourself with.

05:24.669 --> 05:26.843
- Thank you, Paula.

05:26.878 --> 05:28.328
I think Sarah has chores.

05:28.362 --> 05:30.640
Why don't you see to it
that she gets to them.

05:38.199 --> 05:41.962
Sarah, a sweet but
simple young woman

05:41.996 --> 05:45.379
who is repaying her
debt to us by staying on

05:45.414 --> 05:48.348
and helping wherever she can.

05:48.382 --> 05:50.971
I think she just likes to look

05:51.005 --> 05:52.662
at the pictures of the saints.

05:54.008 --> 05:56.079
I don't think she
actually reads the texts.

05:57.633 --> 05:58.875
- [Mary] My name is Mary.

06:02.603 --> 06:03.432
- Mary.

06:06.158 --> 06:07.228
Well of course it is.

06:08.609 --> 06:11.957
While we do spend most
of our days in prayer

06:11.992 --> 06:15.133
or divine labor,
we also make time

06:15.167 --> 06:16.652
for leisure activities.

06:16.686 --> 06:19.551
Such as reading the Holy
texts in this library.

06:22.140 --> 06:25.661
It may take a day or two for
you to adjust to our routine.

06:25.695 --> 06:27.697
But if you do decide to stay,

06:27.732 --> 06:31.114
our schedule will soon
become your schedule.

06:31.149 --> 06:32.668
If it seems like
I'm overly cautious

06:32.702 --> 06:34.946
with the bars on the windows
and the locks on the doors

06:34.980 --> 06:36.913
it's because I am.

06:36.948 --> 06:38.708
We had a break-in recently.

06:38.743 --> 06:41.090
I don't need to tell you
how evil the world is.

06:43.472 --> 06:48.477
[light humming]
[bell ringing]

06:49.581 --> 06:51.756
Doris is seven months along now.

06:51.790 --> 06:53.482
What do you pray for child?

06:55.656 --> 06:57.624
- [Doris] For an end
to this pain mother.

06:59.591 --> 07:00.799
- Oh Doris.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.979
When will you realize
that your pain only

07:08.013 --> 07:10.878
brings you closer to him?

07:10.913 --> 07:13.467
Do you think that
he selfishly prayed

07:13.502 --> 07:15.711
for an end to his own suffering?

07:15.745 --> 07:16.746
Of course not.

07:19.093 --> 07:21.579
He prayed to end the
suffering of others.

07:24.374 --> 07:25.203
Now,

07:27.170 --> 07:27.999
kneel.

07:29.069 --> 07:31.727
[ominous music]

07:47.294 --> 07:49.123
As you can see,
we're going through

07:49.158 --> 07:51.298
a bit of a transition.

07:51.332 --> 07:53.507
The church in Rome, while
they certainly agree

07:53.542 --> 07:56.130
with taking in people like you,

07:56.165 --> 07:58.408
do not agree with my methods.

07:58.443 --> 08:01.377
Which are strict, but very fair.

08:02.551 --> 08:04.691
So they pulled their
portrait of the pope

08:05.795 --> 08:07.417
and cut the Vatican
purse strings.

08:08.764 --> 08:11.076
Maintaining our lifestyle
on private donations

08:11.111 --> 08:13.044
has been challenging
to say the least.

08:14.217 --> 08:15.805
Which is why you
find our sanctuary

08:15.840 --> 08:17.289
in the state that it's in.

08:18.463 --> 08:20.016
Right now however,
I would like you

08:20.051 --> 08:22.916
to worry only about
getting some sleep.

08:22.950 --> 08:25.746
You look like you
could use a good rest.

08:29.681 --> 08:31.994
Focus and clarity
are most important

08:32.028 --> 08:33.202
for a mother-to-be.

08:34.548 --> 08:35.445
Sleep well.

08:43.212 --> 08:44.558

08:46.077 --> 08:46.871
- Oh Jesus.

08:48.493 --> 08:49.425
- They'll hear you.

08:50.564 --> 08:52.221
And you do not want
them to do that.

08:54.223 --> 08:55.742
- Are we the only ones in here?

08:55.776 --> 08:57.433
- Not us in here.

08:57.467 --> 08:58.296
Out there.

08:59.953 --> 09:01.299
They sometimes listen in.

09:02.300 --> 09:03.370
- Are you serious?

09:03.404 --> 09:04.923
- They are.

09:04.958 --> 09:07.098
And they do not allow
talking in the dorms.

09:18.143 --> 09:20.456
That's how they got Veronica.

09:20.490 --> 09:21.561
- [Mary] Who?

09:22.838 --> 09:25.910
- The girl who used
to have your bed.

09:27.705 --> 09:29.361
I'm Catherine.

09:29.396 --> 09:30.846

After all, that's why
you're here isn't it?

17:01.779 --> 17:04.194
I ask you a very
simple question.

17:04.230 --> 17:06.335
Are you here of
your own volition?

17:08.303 --> 17:11.133
In other words, and
you know that I'm

17:11.167 --> 17:12.721
certainly not one to judge,

17:13.686 --> 17:15.034
I want to know that you're here

17:15.068 --> 17:17.174
because you understand
that you are not

17:17.208 --> 17:19.348
responsible enough
to care for the child

17:19.383 --> 17:20.867
growing inside of
you on your own.

17:20.901 --> 17:22.523
- I come here because
I am responsible

17:22.558 --> 17:26.217
and I'm asking for help to
bring my child into this world.

17:28.080 --> 17:29.979
But I'm not giving up my baby.

17:30.014 --> 17:32.051
- Well that's certainly
your decision.

17:32.085 --> 17:35.123
But while you are here
you will be our postulant.

17:35.157 --> 17:37.159
You will live as we do.

17:37.194 --> 17:39.299
Giving yourself over
entirely to the Lord

17:39.334 --> 17:40.645
in service and submission.

17:41.784 --> 17:43.648
Do you know where
that money comes from?

17:44.891 --> 17:46.858
The money that puts
food in our mouths

17:46.893 --> 17:48.067
and keeps the lights on.

17:49.137 --> 17:50.172
- No, no I don't.

17:50.207 --> 17:52.312
- It comes from our sponsors.

17:52.347 --> 17:54.659
People who believe as I
do that women like you

17:54.694 --> 17:56.213
simply don't know
right from wrong.

17:56.247 --> 17:58.456
That you don't have any
degree of responsibility.

17:58.491 --> 18:02.253
Certainly not enough to
care for a child on your own

18:02.288 --> 18:03.599
and that you need help.

18:03.634 --> 18:07.016
Please, don't mistake
my gratitude for greed.

18:07.051 --> 18:09.640
After all, you've seen the
state of things around here.

18:10.744 --> 18:13.678
And the other girls
are so sloppy.

18:15.335 --> 18:17.579
I believe that you
could be the blessing

18:17.613 --> 18:19.374
that we've been waiting for.

18:19.408 --> 18:22.239
After all, people want to
give to someone like you.

18:22.273 --> 18:24.206
Someone who gives them hope.

18:24.241 --> 18:25.483
- I don't feel well--

18:25.518 --> 18:27.278
- And Father Andrew
is going to be your

18:27.313 --> 18:30.074
divine witness to
your commitment to us.

18:31.627 --> 18:35.355
[heavy breathing]
[loud rumbling]

18:35.390 --> 18:36.977
- [Mary] Something,

18:39.221 --> 18:40.740
something's wrong.

18:43.398 --> 18:46.159
[faint whispering]

18:46.194 --> 18:49.921
- [Narrator] Mary, do you know
what happened to my sailboat?

18:49.956 --> 18:51.164
- No I don't.

18:51.199 --> 18:52.924
But we'll find it
in the morning okay?

18:55.686 --> 18:58.137
Remember that secret vacation
I've been telling you about?

18:58.171 --> 18:59.724
- Yeah.

18:59.759 --> 19:01.864
- We might be going a lot
sooner than I thought.

19:01.899 --> 19:05.247
You, me, Jimmy,
finally away from dad.

19:05.282 --> 19:06.248
Right, I love you.

19:07.905 --> 19:08.733
Go to sleep.

19:12.289 --> 19:14.394
[humming]

19:17.915 --> 19:20.573
[water running]

19:23.679 --> 19:26.510
[trumpet playing]

19:43.078 --> 19:44.838
I said go home.

19:44.873 --> 19:46.840
- And I tried.

19:46.875 --> 19:48.117
I already missed you.

19:53.916 --> 19:56.471
[ominous music]

19:56.505 --> 19:59.405
[melancholy music]

20:01.269 --> 20:02.097
- Mary.

20:11.279 --> 20:14.143
[heavy breathing]

20:39.445 --> 20:42.137
[ominous music]

20:49.765 --> 20:51.422
- Well good morning.

20:51.457 --> 20:53.838
I'm so glad to see you up.

20:53.873 --> 20:56.703
I thought you were going
to sleep all winter.

20:56.738 --> 20:58.360
- What time is it?

20:58.395 --> 21:02.053
- It's time for a fresh
new start for everyone.

21:03.296 --> 21:05.091
And Sarah's going to
help you with yours.

21:12.409 --> 21:14.203
- Sarah, what day is it?

21:14.238 --> 21:15.066
- Shh.

21:19.485 --> 21:20.279
Tuesday.

21:21.349 --> 21:23.454
No, Wednesday.

21:25.387 --> 21:26.664
I don't know actually.

21:28.597 --> 21:29.805
They blend together.

21:31.359 --> 21:33.740
Would you mind sitting
so I can reach your hair?

21:40.644 --> 21:42.059
Do you want a boy or a girl?

21:43.163 --> 21:43.992
- I'm not sure.

21:46.443 --> 21:48.445
I'm not sure of much
right now actually.

21:50.585 --> 21:53.208
- They say boys are easier
to raise than girls.

21:55.590 --> 21:57.419
I had a boy when
I first got here.

22:01.975 --> 22:03.218
He died in childbirth.

22:05.634 --> 22:07.222
They showed me a picture though.

22:08.188 --> 22:09.328
He was beautiful.

22:18.406 --> 22:20.787
- I miss you Jimmy, every day.

22:21.961 --> 22:23.445
I suppose it would
be redundant to ask

22:23.480 --> 22:25.896
if you're staying
out of trouble.

22:25.930 --> 22:28.554
I'm starting to wonder
if I made a mistake.

22:28.588 --> 22:30.279
But I'm hopeful
it's just going to

22:30.314 --> 22:32.385
take some time to adjust.

22:32.420 --> 22:34.042
Write me back.

22:34.076 --> 22:35.388
Tell me you love
me and we are doing

22:35.423 --> 22:36.872
what's best for our family.

22:38.426 --> 22:39.323
- She'll read it.

22:46.054 --> 22:47.055
Who's it to?

22:48.056 --> 22:48.919
- The father.

22:51.300 --> 22:52.474
- Just remember,

22:53.751 --> 22:55.546
there's no guarantee
she'll send it.

22:57.790 --> 23:02.795
[humming]
[bell ringing]

23:03.554 --> 23:05.729
[slow paced music]

23:16.360 --> 23:20.191
[singing in foreign language]

23:40.246 --> 23:41.420
- Sit down.

23:42.800 --> 23:45.044
- [Catherine] I don't
feel well, I need to...

23:48.496 --> 23:50.532
- You're not excused, sit down.

23:54.743 --> 23:55.537
[vomiting]

23:55.572 --> 23:56.400
- Catherine.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.263
- [Nun] Sit down.

24:10.172 --> 24:11.588
- You poor thing.

24:11.622 --> 24:13.175
Would you like to be excused?

24:14.383 --> 24:15.799
- Yes.

24:15.833 --> 24:19.078
- Of course, you just need
to finish your supper.

24:22.564 --> 24:23.703
- I already did mother.

24:25.153 --> 24:27.500
- Then why am I staring
at it all over the table?

24:32.056 --> 24:33.713
We don't waste food here.

24:37.234 --> 24:39.892
[ominous music]

24:45.622 --> 24:48.487
[heavy breathing]

25:13.063 --> 25:15.168
[banging]

25:21.796 --> 25:24.212
[scratching]

25:27.249 --> 25:29.493
[creaking]

26:07.496 --> 26:09.706
[clanking]

26:11.777 --> 26:12.950
- Shh.

26:12.985 --> 26:15.021
- [Mary] There's
something up there.

26:15.056 --> 26:15.884
- Mary don't.

26:17.334 --> 26:18.162
They'll see.

26:58.617 --> 27:02.551
[screaming]
[singing in foreign language]

27:02.586 --> 27:04.415
- [Mother] What is going on?

27:05.313 --> 27:07.073
- Mary saw something.

27:07.108 --> 27:08.074
- A face.

27:08.109 --> 27:10.421
- A face?
[laughing]

27:10.456 --> 27:13.010
[loud banging]

27:24.643 --> 27:26.679
- [Narrator] It's
just a broken pipe!

27:26.714 --> 27:28.301
- Mary I'm still
lenient with you because

27:28.336 --> 27:29.406
you're fairly new here.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.132
- I swear, I'm not crazy.

27:31.166 --> 27:33.962
- And if I recall, don't you
also see your dead brother?

27:35.757 --> 27:37.000
- What did you say?

27:37.034 --> 27:38.449
- I said aren't you
prone to seeing your

27:38.484 --> 27:39.623
little dead brother?

27:39.658 --> 27:41.176
The one you murdered
in a bathtub?

27:42.350 --> 27:43.144
- What?

27:43.178 --> 27:43.972
No.

27:44.007 --> 27:44.835
I wanna leave.

27:46.285 --> 27:49.184
I made a mistake and
I would like to leave.

27:50.047 --> 27:51.393
- Absolutely your choice.

27:52.567 --> 27:54.051
But don't you think
you'll fair better

27:54.086 --> 27:55.812
out there with a
good nights sleep?

27:57.227 --> 27:59.747
We're going to bring you
something to calm you down.

27:59.781 --> 28:01.990
And everyone's gonna
get a good night sleep.

28:06.098 --> 28:07.513
- I don't want it.

28:07.547 --> 28:08.756
- While you are in this house,

28:08.790 --> 28:10.378
you will abide by her rules.

28:10.412 --> 28:12.829
Tomorrow you can return
to your life of sin.

28:12.863 --> 28:16.729
But tonight, right now,
you will take these pills

28:16.764 --> 28:20.043
and show some respect to
the people helping you.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.361
[ominous music]

28:58.875 --> 29:01.567
[faint singing]

29:10.714 --> 29:11.853
- He's here.

29:11.888 --> 29:12.958
- [Jimmy] Shit, your
pa's home early.

29:15.892 --> 29:17.031
- God damn.

29:17.065 --> 29:18.308
Son of a bitch.

29:19.516 --> 29:22.070
- William, dad's home early.

29:22.105 --> 29:22.933
William!

29:26.178 --> 29:29.422
[singing gibberish]

29:29.457 --> 29:31.700
[clanking]

29:35.774 --> 29:37.189
- Son of a bitch!

29:38.121 --> 29:40.779
[ominous music]

29:43.885 --> 29:45.887
- [Mary] William?

29:45.922 --> 29:46.785
William!

29:48.027 --> 29:48.856
William!

29:49.857 --> 29:50.719
William!

29:51.962 --> 29:52.791
William!

29:59.832 --> 30:01.454
- William, hey, William!

30:01.489 --> 30:02.352
Wake up!

30:02.386 --> 30:03.802
What have you done!

30:03.836 --> 30:06.390
[loud sobbing]

30:06.425 --> 30:07.426
- I'm sorry!

30:47.328 --> 30:48.156
Catherine.

30:51.884 --> 30:52.678
Doris.

30:55.888 --> 30:56.682
Doris!

30:59.305 --> 31:01.618
[screaming]

31:14.803 --> 31:15.632
No.

31:16.909 --> 31:17.703
No.

31:44.074 --> 31:45.006
- Rejoice.

31:46.249 --> 31:47.457
All of you.

31:47.491 --> 31:50.425
Tonight your slate
will be wiped clean.

31:50.460 --> 31:54.291
Mary will die tonight so
that you may be reborn.

31:54.326 --> 31:56.466
But the sins of your past

31:56.500 --> 31:59.987
will continue to
haunt and destroy you

32:00.021 --> 32:02.058
until you submit
to our way of life.

32:02.990 --> 32:03.818
And to me.

32:04.992 --> 32:08.098
You do not deserve
the name Mary.

32:08.133 --> 32:09.272
She was pure.

32:10.204 --> 32:12.378
She was innocent.

32:12.413 --> 32:15.692
And you are immoral,

32:15.726 --> 32:18.177
corrupt, and vile.

32:18.212 --> 32:19.868
But I have good news.

32:19.903 --> 32:21.663
I have found another.

32:21.698 --> 32:24.839
I rename you Agatha.

32:25.909 --> 32:26.737
- [Narrator] Agatha.

32:44.928 --> 32:47.448
- Help me!
[suspenseful music]

32:47.482 --> 32:48.414
Get me out!

32:49.415 --> 32:53.557
Help me!

32:53.592 --> 32:56.595
[faint whisperings]

33:09.125 --> 33:11.265
Oh please, please, please.

33:13.025 --> 33:13.784
- [Narrator] Who are you?

33:13.819 --> 33:14.716
- [Paula] Say your name.

33:14.751 --> 33:15.545
- Who are you?

33:15.579 --> 33:16.925
- [Paula] Say your name.

33:16.960 --> 33:17.788
- Eat.

33:20.308 --> 33:21.861
- You're fucking insane!

33:21.896 --> 33:22.724
Help me!

33:25.072 --> 33:26.004
Please.

33:26.038 --> 33:26.832
- [Narrator] Who are you?

33:26.866 --> 33:28.144
- Say your name.

33:28.178 --> 33:28.972
- [Narrator] Who are you?

33:29.007 --> 33:29.800
- Say your name?

33:29.835 --> 33:31.388
- [Mary] Get me out!

33:34.460 --> 33:35.737
Please, please.

33:40.984 --> 33:42.054
Make it stop.

33:43.124 --> 33:43.952
- Who are you?

33:43.987 --> 33:44.919
- Say your name?

33:44.953 --> 33:45.747
- Who are you?

33:45.782 --> 33:46.955
- [Paula] Say your name.

33:46.990 --> 33:47.818
- Eat.

33:50.476 --> 33:51.305
Eat.

33:53.238 --> 33:54.549
- [Narrator] She's choking.

33:54.584 --> 33:55.412
- Let her.

33:57.828 --> 34:00.038
- I said enough,
she loses that baby

34:00.072 --> 34:01.315
this was all for nothing.

34:02.523 --> 34:05.146
You need to stay calm
and remember your baby.

34:06.113 --> 34:07.355
- Why are you doing this?

34:07.390 --> 34:09.185
- One must atone for their sins.

34:13.120 --> 34:14.016
Oh you will eat.

34:15.260 --> 34:17.295
Just like a little baby bird.

34:19.918 --> 34:21.507
- [Mary] No please.

34:43.114 --> 34:46.222
- Hey, are you okay?

34:48.638 --> 34:49.466
Okay.

34:52.780 --> 34:55.714
[slow paced music]

35:11.488 --> 35:12.662
- [Mary] I'm leaving.

35:12.696 --> 35:15.596
I'm not letting
you near this baby.

35:15.630 --> 35:17.080
- The hell did you say to me?

35:18.219 --> 35:19.082
- Do it.

35:20.877 --> 35:23.017
I've nothing here without him.

35:24.743 --> 35:26.227
I'm leaving just like mom did.

35:50.217 --> 35:55.187
[faint whisperings]
[growling]

36:09.684 --> 36:12.549
[whistling]

36:12.584 --> 36:14.586
- You still ain't
slept have you?

36:14.620 --> 36:15.449
- [Mary] I'm not tired.

36:15.483 --> 36:16.381
- Yeah I figured.

36:16.415 --> 36:17.520
You need to eat something.

36:19.107 --> 36:20.281
- [Mary] I'm not hungry.

36:28.496 --> 36:29.635
- Remember me?

36:29.670 --> 36:30.498
- Jimmy.

36:31.775 --> 36:32.742
- I remember you.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.366
You two little shits took me
for everything that I had.

36:37.954 --> 36:38.955
- [Mary] What are we...

36:38.989 --> 36:41.199
- Ooh, you've been busy.

36:42.510 --> 36:43.891
[groaning]

36:43.925 --> 36:45.479
- [Mary] Stop!

36:45.513 --> 36:46.342
Stop!

36:50.553 --> 36:51.554
- Now--

36:51.588 --> 36:52.382
- [Mary] What do you want!

36:52.417 --> 36:53.245
- Where's my money?

36:53.280 --> 36:54.833
- Fuck you, I spent it!

36:54.867 --> 36:56.317
- Bullshit.

36:56.352 --> 36:57.836
- [Mary] Stop, it's here!

36:57.870 --> 36:58.699
It's here!

36:59.527 --> 37:00.873
- [Jimmy] Fuck!

37:00.908 --> 37:02.116
- [Mary] Here.

37:02.150 --> 37:03.738
- [Jimmy] No, no,
no, Mary don't!

37:04.601 --> 37:08.674
- Okay just take it.

37:08.709 --> 37:10.158
Take it all!

37:10.193 --> 37:11.159
- Hell, that's 20, 30
times what I took off you!

37:11.194 --> 37:12.264
- Shut up!

37:12.299 --> 37:13.507
- [Mary] Just go, please!

37:13.541 --> 37:15.681
- You consider that
just an asshole pass.

37:15.716 --> 37:16.544
You hear me!

37:17.994 --> 37:18.960
- You have what you want, go!

37:20.514 --> 37:21.825
- Just about the right price

37:21.860 --> 37:24.242
to stop me from killing
all three of ya.

37:27.348 --> 37:29.971
[bell ringing]

37:37.324 --> 37:38.152
- Come.

37:40.085 --> 37:41.189
[faint whisperings]

37:41.224 --> 37:43.122
- [Narrator] Your name.

38:08.527 --> 38:10.218
Your name is Agatha.

38:15.120 --> 38:17.398
- [Narrator] Tell
them your name,

38:17.433 --> 38:19.055
end this suffering.

38:24.232 --> 38:29.237
- [Mary] Help me!
[ominous music]

38:47.704 --> 38:48.567
- Who are you?

38:50.224 --> 38:51.018
- [Mary] Agatha.

38:51.052 --> 38:51.881
- Louder!

38:54.746 --> 38:55.540
- Agatha.

38:55.574 --> 38:56.782
- Again!

38:56.817 --> 38:58.612
- [Mary] Agatha!

38:58.646 --> 39:00.165
- Sister Helen, the footstool.

39:03.271 --> 39:07.862
My child, you came here to
give your baby a better life.

39:07.897 --> 39:11.349
Now we can let that happen.

39:11.383 --> 39:12.211
Come.

39:20.979 --> 39:22.049
There we are.

39:24.016 --> 39:26.778
All that's left is to
rid you of the vestiges

39:26.812 --> 39:28.366
of who you once were.

39:58.085 --> 40:00.363
[creaking]

40:32.982 --> 40:35.433
- What happened to your back?

40:37.020 --> 40:37.918
Was it her?

40:39.540 --> 40:40.403
- She won't miss the child.

40:42.957 --> 40:45.235
It was my husband.

40:45.270 --> 40:46.444
- He did this?

40:47.755 --> 40:48.756
- Car crash.

40:52.346 --> 40:53.140
He died.

40:55.556 --> 40:56.384
I didn't.

40:59.940 --> 41:03.426
This baby is all I
have left of him.

41:03.461 --> 41:04.254
I'm sorry.

41:05.566 --> 41:07.395
For what she did to
you, really I am.

41:07.430 --> 41:08.914
But you need to
keep your head down.

41:08.949 --> 41:10.191
- She put me in a coffin.

41:10.226 --> 41:12.124
- You to try and
do what she says.

41:13.816 --> 41:15.576
If you fight her,
that coffin will be

41:15.611 --> 41:17.475
the least of your worries.

41:18.717 --> 41:20.995
[creaking]

41:38.150 --> 41:40.808
[ominous music]

41:44.502 --> 41:45.951
- [Mary] I killed my brother.

41:48.644 --> 41:50.853
I was supposed to
be watching him.

41:50.887 --> 41:52.510
He drowned because of me.

41:54.373 --> 41:56.134
He haunts me.

41:56.168 --> 41:57.376
I can't sleep.

41:58.757 --> 42:00.518
- You are unwell Agatha.

42:00.552 --> 42:02.623
In fact, you're very very sick.

42:04.349 --> 42:07.145
You're certainly not fit
to be anyone's mother.

42:08.042 --> 42:10.389
- [Mary] Sometimes I see things.

42:10.424 --> 42:11.563
- [Mother] And how does
that make you feel?

42:11.598 --> 42:13.600
- [Mary] Out of
control and helpless.

42:14.739 --> 42:15.740
- [Mother] And how
does your family feel

42:15.774 --> 42:16.844
about your situation?

42:18.397 --> 42:20.192
- [Mary] They have
all abandoned me.

42:23.679 --> 42:25.508
I could be dead.

42:25.543 --> 42:27.372
They don't seem to care.

42:27.406 --> 42:29.063
I need to lay down.

42:29.098 --> 42:31.618
I don't know what's
real anymore.

42:31.652 --> 42:32.895
I see things.

42:34.172 --> 42:35.622
- [Mother] What kind of things?

42:35.656 --> 42:39.039
- [Mary] If I told you,
you might think I'm crazy.

42:40.730 --> 42:41.869
Maybe I am.

42:41.904 --> 42:43.353
- [Mother] Maybe you are what?

42:43.388 --> 42:44.596
- [Mary] Crazy.

42:53.985 --> 42:55.745
[creaking]

42:55.780 --> 42:58.783
[suspenseful music]

43:04.789 --> 43:05.755
- Bad dream?

43:06.894 --> 43:07.964
It could be the pills.

43:09.241 --> 43:10.588
They give me migraines.

43:15.385 --> 43:16.663
- Agatha what is it?

43:20.598 --> 43:22.013
- Was I here all night?

43:24.256 --> 43:25.085
- Yes.

43:25.119 --> 43:26.431
- I keep seeing things.

43:30.193 --> 43:31.919
Why are you dressed like that?

43:31.954 --> 43:33.196
- The donor breakfast.

43:35.129 --> 43:37.822
We eat breakfast with the
donors while they judge us.

43:43.103 --> 43:44.276
- [Mary] This is wrong.

43:45.657 --> 43:48.073
- [Catherine] There is no
wrong or right in this place.

43:49.316 --> 43:51.180
- You're just choosing
not to see it.

43:54.252 --> 43:55.322
- I see everything.

43:57.531 --> 43:58.359
All of it.

44:01.155 --> 44:02.950
And it breaks me

44:02.985 --> 44:04.331
every single time.

44:05.608 --> 44:06.678
- Stop talking.

44:11.545 --> 44:12.960
- If you let her
see how you feel

44:12.995 --> 44:14.444
about anything she does to you

44:14.479 --> 44:16.032
or anyone you care about--

44:16.067 --> 44:16.895
- Catherine.

44:19.070 --> 44:21.762
- She will use it like a
knife to cut you even deeper.

44:25.663 --> 44:28.010
That's why I keep my
fucking mouth shut Agatha.

44:30.046 --> 44:30.875
So should you.

44:34.085 --> 44:35.673
- Stop talking.

44:52.759 --> 44:54.761
[gasping]

44:54.795 --> 44:56.694
- Oh she's fabulous.

44:56.728 --> 44:58.696
Look at how cute she is.

45:01.215 --> 45:02.458
- Agatha!

45:02.492 --> 45:03.735
Stop!

45:03.770 --> 45:05.772
- [Mary] Somebody help!

45:05.806 --> 45:07.152
- [Paula] Agatha!

45:07.187 --> 45:08.671
- Help!

45:08.706 --> 45:10.708
Somebody, somebody help!

45:12.571 --> 45:13.711
- [Paula] Agatha stop!

45:13.745 --> 45:14.573
- Help!

45:18.198 --> 45:19.371
Somebody help!

45:22.409 --> 45:24.549
Somebody help me!

45:24.583 --> 45:25.412
Help!

45:26.758 --> 45:27.586
Somebody!

45:31.556 --> 45:33.869
[screaming]

45:36.975 --> 45:40.807
[singing in foreign language]

46:02.829 --> 46:03.968
- No, no, no, no, hell no.

46:04.002 --> 46:05.486
A soup kitchen.

46:05.521 --> 46:06.487
- [Mary] What?

46:06.522 --> 46:07.316
- Uh uh.

46:07.350 --> 46:08.558
- We have nothing.

46:08.593 --> 46:09.870
Everything we had was
just stolen from us.

46:09.905 --> 46:12.114
- I got this Kansas
City gig coming up.

46:12.148 --> 46:14.633
- Okay, and what am
I supposed to do?

46:14.668 --> 46:16.532
- Well how about
you come with me?

46:16.566 --> 46:18.051
- And stay where?

46:18.085 --> 46:19.397
- You stay with me.

46:19.431 --> 46:21.088
You stay with me and
the boys, it'd be fun.

46:21.123 --> 46:23.608
- Half a dozen roughnecks
in a run down motel room.

46:23.642 --> 46:24.471
- There's four.

46:26.024 --> 46:26.853
Five.

46:29.165 --> 46:30.718
- Is that all you really want?

46:30.753 --> 46:32.651
- Well no, it's not
what I really want Mary.

46:32.686 --> 46:34.550
But what I really
want don't matter.

46:34.584 --> 46:36.034
I can't have the mother
of my unborn child

46:36.069 --> 46:37.173
staying by herself.

46:37.208 --> 46:38.347
I'm out of options.

46:38.381 --> 46:40.004
What do you want me to do?

46:40.038 --> 46:42.282
- So you want to leave town
and have me follow you around,

46:42.316 --> 46:44.042
and then maybe the
next town after that?

46:44.077 --> 46:46.217
Or do you just wanna go alone?

46:46.251 --> 46:47.943
- Do I wanna go alone?

46:47.977 --> 46:51.912
Yeah, yeah I wanna
go alone, yeah.

46:51.947 --> 46:53.603
Yeah you enjoy your supper.

47:08.066 --> 47:10.034
- [Nun] We take care
of women like you.

47:10.966 --> 47:13.347
You're going to be just fine.

47:17.558 --> 47:19.491
- They're gonna
fix you right up.

47:19.526 --> 47:20.354
Good as new.

47:25.635 --> 47:27.292
- [Mary] Where am I?

47:29.916 --> 47:31.779
- The doctor has been called

47:31.814 --> 47:33.851
and he is on his way.

47:33.885 --> 47:35.059
Thank you again.

47:35.093 --> 47:36.819
Paula will you see
the Wrights out?

47:36.854 --> 47:37.993
- No don't go.

47:39.408 --> 47:40.823
Don't go.

47:40.858 --> 47:42.135
Come back!

47:42.169 --> 47:42.998
Don't go!

47:43.930 --> 47:44.896
- Oh Agatha.

47:51.316 --> 47:52.317
Get out!

47:52.352 --> 47:53.525
Out of my bed!

47:54.802 --> 47:55.631
Leave!

47:56.735 --> 47:58.876
[sobbing]

48:26.558 --> 48:29.320
Oh, we must clean that
before it becomes infected.

48:30.804 --> 48:33.117
[screaming]

48:38.743 --> 48:41.849
When you disobey me,
it stings like salt

48:41.884 --> 48:42.954
on an open wound.

48:46.544 --> 48:50.168
[light singing in
foreign language]

48:50.203 --> 48:52.895
[faint ringing]

48:54.483 --> 48:56.105
- Just answer the
god damn phone.

48:59.764 --> 49:00.834
God damn it.

49:12.501 --> 49:13.916
Operator, I've got a
little bit of an emergency.

49:13.951 --> 49:15.090
Could you give me
the address for the

49:15.124 --> 49:16.781
phone number I've
been trying to reach?

49:18.610 --> 49:19.542
Alright, thank you.

49:38.251 --> 49:39.873
- I'm leaving here.

49:40.908 --> 49:42.151
I swear to God.

49:43.739 --> 49:46.397
- Next time I'm coming with you.

49:52.920 --> 49:53.749
- Not you two.

50:00.756 --> 50:04.070
Paula tells me that you two
are becoming fast friends.

50:05.519 --> 50:06.865
I think that's splendid.

50:08.350 --> 50:10.835
Did you enjoy breakfast
the other morning Agatha?

50:12.837 --> 50:14.183
I thought it was wonderful.

50:16.116 --> 50:20.500
It's so rare that we allow
ourselves such an indulgence.

50:20.534 --> 50:23.158
But I think our donors are happy

50:23.192 --> 50:25.712
when they see us
well fed and healthy.

50:26.816 --> 50:28.749
Didn't you enjoy it Catherine?

50:28.784 --> 50:29.612
- Yes.

50:30.510 --> 50:31.545
- Yes.

50:31.580 --> 50:33.754
[chuckling]

50:33.789 --> 50:34.686
Sometimes,

50:36.895 --> 50:38.380
all I will need is to eat

50:38.414 --> 50:40.692
a single perfect strawberry

50:42.384 --> 50:44.524
as proof of God's love.

50:45.939 --> 50:47.423
- I wasn't at the breakfast.

50:48.459 --> 50:49.632
- You weren't?

50:51.738 --> 50:52.980
Oh that's right.

50:53.015 --> 50:55.431
You were running around
like an insane person.

50:55.466 --> 50:56.260
Sit down!

50:57.951 --> 51:00.609
Embarrassing me in
front of our donors.

51:02.093 --> 51:05.200
This entire place runs on
their donations Agatha.

51:05.234 --> 51:07.236
They want to see a
healthy, beautiful,

51:07.271 --> 51:09.342
intelligent,
well-adjusted young woman.

51:09.376 --> 51:12.966
They don't want to see
someone plagued be demons.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.072
They care not for your darkness.

51:15.106 --> 51:16.038
Do you understand?

51:17.453 --> 51:18.247
Do you understand!

51:18.282 --> 51:19.110
- Yes!

51:22.803 --> 51:25.806
- You're just a wise-ass
little bitch aren't you?

51:25.841 --> 51:28.464
You will not raise your voice
in the house of the Lord.

51:28.499 --> 51:30.984
And you will never raise
your voice to me again.

51:31.018 --> 51:31.950
Is that understood?

51:32.917 --> 51:33.745
- Yes.

51:34.988 --> 51:35.782
- I can't hear you.

51:35.816 --> 51:36.990
- [Mary] Yes.

51:37.024 --> 51:37.818
- I can't hear you.

51:37.853 --> 51:39.165
- [Mary] Yes.

51:39.199 --> 51:40.235
- Say it again.

51:40.269 --> 51:41.098
- Yes.

51:41.132 --> 51:42.029
- [Mother] Say it again.

51:42.064 --> 51:43.203
- Yes.

51:43.238 --> 51:44.480
- Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes.

51:44.515 --> 51:46.068
You will drive those
demons from your head

51:46.103 --> 51:48.484
and think only of your baby.

51:48.519 --> 51:49.520
Now get out.

51:59.875 --> 52:03.361
As I said before, the money
simply isn't available.

52:03.396 --> 52:04.983
But you of all
people should know

52:05.018 --> 52:06.433
that I have done more for you

52:06.468 --> 52:08.815
than anyone would have dreamed.

52:08.849 --> 52:09.643
Now,

52:10.851 --> 52:12.646
please remember that
the harsh reality

52:12.681 --> 52:15.166
is none of us have any
other real options.

52:33.943 --> 52:35.428
We have a problem.

52:38.914 --> 52:40.157
You have a visitor.

52:40.191 --> 52:41.779
And at some point you
will explain to me

52:41.813 --> 52:43.746
how this boy came to
be on this property.

52:43.781 --> 52:45.645
But now he endangers us all.

52:45.679 --> 52:47.302
So you're going to make
sure that he's alone

52:47.336 --> 52:49.096
and that he leaves.

52:49.131 --> 52:51.202
Sister Susan is
an excellent shot

52:51.237 --> 52:52.997
and I can assure
you, she won't be

52:53.031 --> 52:54.861
pointing that at you.

52:54.895 --> 52:57.622
Because I would never do
anything to endanger my child.

52:58.485 --> 53:00.073
[loud banging]

53:00.107 --> 53:02.489
Now, let's go say hello.

53:06.113 --> 53:08.012
[creaking]

53:08.046 --> 53:09.669
- Mary Lou as I live and--

53:09.703 --> 53:11.153
Look how big you've gotten!

53:11.188 --> 53:12.223
Oh my god.

53:12.258 --> 53:13.466
- Please, it's okay, stop.

53:14.570 --> 53:16.331
I don't wanna see you anymore.

53:16.365 --> 53:18.056
- You don't know what
you're talking about.

53:18.091 --> 53:19.748
I traveled 300
damn miles to come

53:19.782 --> 53:20.887
down here and see you.

53:22.164 --> 53:22.992
- Are you alone?

53:24.994 --> 53:25.823
- Yeah.

53:27.376 --> 53:28.584
- [Mary] And nobody
knows I'm here?

53:28.619 --> 53:30.172
[clanking]

53:30.207 --> 53:31.863
- No, of course not.

53:33.348 --> 53:34.728
- Good.

53:34.763 --> 53:36.109
I don't want you or
anyone from my past

53:36.143 --> 53:37.662
to be part of my baby's future.

53:38.732 --> 53:40.389
- Our baby's
future, my baby too.

53:40.424 --> 53:42.080
And what, what,

53:42.115 --> 53:43.150
I'm confused right now.

53:43.185 --> 53:43.979
What's happening?

53:44.013 --> 53:44.842
- Listen.

53:46.050 --> 53:47.258
Things are different now.

53:47.293 --> 53:48.777
- Okay, so things are different.

53:48.811 --> 53:50.503
Just listen to me.

53:50.537 --> 53:51.918
- I'm done listening.

53:51.952 --> 53:52.781
You have to go.

53:53.816 --> 53:56.060
If you love me you will go.

53:58.614 --> 54:00.340
- I don't understand.

54:01.652 --> 54:03.101
- You're just like my father.

54:04.241 --> 54:05.725
You just wanted to control me.

54:07.830 --> 54:08.797
- That's horseshit.

54:10.074 --> 54:10.868
No I didn't.

54:12.145 --> 54:13.180
- It's over James.

54:15.528 --> 54:17.357
This is my life now.

54:18.876 --> 54:20.291
- These people got in your head.

54:20.326 --> 54:21.154
- No.

54:21.188 --> 54:22.328
- [Jimmy] Yeah.

54:22.362 --> 54:25.123
- No, they've shown
me what matters.

54:25.158 --> 54:27.298
And you're not a
part of that anymore.

54:30.197 --> 54:31.233
- Yeah.

54:31.268 --> 54:32.096
- [Mary] Go.

54:34.201 --> 54:35.548
- Mary, come on now.

54:35.582 --> 54:36.790
- No, my name is Agatha.

54:42.175 --> 54:43.763
Go, you have to go.

54:45.074 --> 54:46.421
Please?

54:46.455 --> 54:48.837
- I'll go, if you come with me.

54:48.871 --> 54:50.045
- [Mary] No.

54:50.079 --> 54:51.564
- That's the only
way I'm leaving here.

54:51.598 --> 54:52.979
I'm not going
anywhere without you.

54:53.013 --> 54:54.325
I'm not leaving without you.
- No, no, no, stop.

54:54.360 --> 54:55.844
- I came all this way!
- No.

54:55.878 --> 54:57.501
- [Jimmy] Please don't
make me go over there--

54:57.535 --> 54:58.329
- It's not yours.

54:58.364 --> 55:00.193
It's not your child.

55:00.227 --> 55:01.263
It's not your child.

55:03.369 --> 55:04.266
- You're lying, come on.

55:04.301 --> 55:05.371
- [Mary] No, it's not yours.

55:05.405 --> 55:06.233
- No, you're lying.

55:06.268 --> 55:07.096
- Go, go!

55:07.925 --> 55:08.753
Go!

55:09.927 --> 55:12.723
Leave, it's not
your child, leave!

55:22.180 --> 55:24.390
[creaking]

55:30.154 --> 55:35.159
[singing in foreign language]
[sobbing]

56:07.087 --> 56:08.572
- [Catherine] It's
not your fault.

56:08.606 --> 56:10.090
- I sent him away.

56:10.125 --> 56:12.196
- They threatened to kill him.

56:12.230 --> 56:13.404
You didn't have a choice.

56:15.095 --> 56:16.649
At least he knows
where you are now.

56:16.683 --> 56:18.927
[clapping]

56:24.829 --> 56:25.658
It's poison.

56:27.073 --> 56:29.593
Paula's been waging war
since she saw the first one.

56:47.956 --> 56:48.784
- Chins up.

56:50.234 --> 56:51.062
Smile.

56:53.479 --> 56:56.965
- Once again, I want
to thank all of you.

56:58.449 --> 57:02.073
Not only for your time, but
for your generous donations

57:02.108 --> 57:04.662
which help to support our girls

57:04.697 --> 57:06.353
in their hour of need.

57:07.803 --> 57:11.738
Please take this moment to
get to know each of them.

57:11.773 --> 57:13.222
Who shall we start with?

57:15.397 --> 57:18.227
- [Narrator] Are you
feeling better sweetheart?

57:18.262 --> 57:19.815
- Much.

57:19.850 --> 57:22.335
Thank you again for
the help the other day.

57:22.369 --> 57:23.163
I wasn't myself.

57:23.198 --> 57:24.717
- Yes, yes of course.

57:24.751 --> 57:26.684
- We all have our off days.

57:29.066 --> 57:30.550
- I have just one more question.

57:35.210 --> 57:36.245
- [Mary] We all have
to work together

57:36.280 --> 57:37.626
on getting out of here now.

57:37.661 --> 57:40.387
Not tomorrow, not
in the morning, now.

57:40.422 --> 57:41.906
- You can't, they'll hear you.

57:43.736 --> 57:46.048
- You really feel
safe in this place?

57:46.083 --> 57:48.775
Knowing that you have to
deliver your child into this?

57:50.501 --> 57:51.329
What?

57:54.678 --> 57:55.506
Sarah?

57:56.714 --> 57:58.923
Sarah if you know
something, please.

58:02.755 --> 58:05.585
- I think they lied
to me about my baby.

58:05.620 --> 58:08.312
[ominous music]

58:14.870 --> 58:16.493
His name was David.

58:17.666 --> 58:19.599
I gave birth and I
heard him crying.

58:22.637 --> 58:24.501
I was excited to hold him

58:24.535 --> 58:26.226
and they took him
out of the room.

58:28.574 --> 58:31.646
The next morning when I woke up,

58:31.680 --> 58:33.199
they told me he was dead.

58:36.651 --> 58:37.652
I was drugged.

58:39.274 --> 58:41.828
But I know that I
heard him crying again.

58:44.037 --> 58:47.938
There were no other babies here.

58:49.146 --> 58:51.873
And a mother knows the sound

58:51.907 --> 58:54.013
of her own baby's crying.

58:55.497 --> 58:57.810
[sobbing]

58:57.844 --> 59:00.088
[creaking]

59:01.641 --> 59:04.126
- Talk, talk, talk,
talk, talk, talk, talk,

59:04.161 --> 59:06.543
talk, talk, talk, talk.

59:09.062 --> 59:12.652
So much talking from young
girls vowed to silence.

59:14.965 --> 59:17.830
You must have so many more
things you'd like to say.

59:17.864 --> 59:20.384
So many secrets you'd
like to share with God.

59:39.403 --> 59:40.577
- What's this?

59:42.820 --> 59:45.167
- You know perfectly
well what this is.

59:45.202 --> 59:46.410
- My things?

59:46.444 --> 59:47.791
- Well yes, you're
going to be needing them

59:47.825 --> 59:49.171
now that you're leaving us.

59:50.172 --> 59:50.966
- Leave?

59:51.001 --> 59:51.829
No.

59:52.865 --> 59:54.142
I don't have anywhere to go.

59:54.176 --> 59:55.005
- I know.

59:56.213 --> 59:58.491
And it breaks my heart
because I love you so.

59:59.457 --> 01:00:00.700
But I'm afraid I only have room

01:00:00.735 --> 01:00:02.150
for people who are loyal to me.

01:00:02.184 --> 01:00:03.738
- I'm loyal, I am.

01:00:04.773 --> 01:00:06.257
I am.

01:00:06.292 --> 01:00:07.086
- Are you?

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:07.949
- I am.

01:00:10.537 --> 01:00:11.746
- I don't think you are.

01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:16.164
Loyal people don't
wag their tongues

01:00:16.198 --> 01:00:18.476
propagating hate
and lies against

01:00:18.511 --> 01:00:20.927
the only person who's
ever cared about them.

01:00:22.101 --> 01:00:24.137
- I don't know how
to do anything else.

01:00:24.172 --> 01:00:25.069
- I know.

01:00:26.588 --> 01:00:29.418
You'll probably rot out there.

01:00:29.453 --> 01:00:31.213
I'll have no doubt.

01:00:31.248 --> 01:00:35.148
Paula, will you please bring
Agatha to the dining room?

01:00:46.608 --> 01:00:50.681
You see Sarah, what I
am trying to do here

01:00:50.716 --> 01:00:54.478
is much much bigger than
anything you can comprehend

01:00:54.512 --> 01:00:58.137
with that sad little
brain of yours.

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:04.005
However,

01:01:06.386 --> 01:01:09.493
there may be a way
for you to stay

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:14.429
and keep your tongue
from wagging against me.

01:01:32.309 --> 01:01:34.000
I'll give you a few moments.

01:01:34.035 --> 01:01:36.485
Please make your decision
by the time I get back.

01:01:39.972 --> 01:01:42.146
[sobbing]

01:01:46.012 --> 01:01:49.567
Agatha, there is a reason

01:01:49.602 --> 01:01:52.605
that I command everyone
to take a vow of silence.

01:01:53.744 --> 01:01:55.332
There's a reason
for everything I do.

01:02:07.447 --> 01:02:10.761
Your continued
meddling with the minds

01:02:10.796 --> 01:02:12.349
of these young girls

01:02:12.383 --> 01:02:14.765
will bring them
nothing but pain.

- Sarah?

01:02:40.998 --> 01:02:42.344
Sarah what did you do?

01:02:42.379 --> 01:02:43.276
- [Mother] Paula go
down to the basement

01:02:43.311 --> 01:02:44.450
and fetch the doctor.

01:02:44.484 --> 01:02:45.278
- [Paula] Yes mother.

01:02:45.313 --> 01:02:46.452
- Get out of my way.

01:02:46.486 --> 01:02:47.349
Do you want to help Agatha?

01:02:47.384 --> 01:02:48.178
- [Mary] Yes!

01:02:48.212 --> 01:02:49.420
- Then hold her.

01:02:49.455 --> 01:02:51.906
Let me see child,
what have you done?

01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:53.770
Oh, you didn't finish.

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:55.910
- You monster!

01:02:55.944 --> 01:02:57.359
You're a monster!

01:03:00.604 --> 01:03:03.055
She cut her own tongue out!

01:03:03.089 --> 01:03:04.470
They're monsters!

01:03:04.504 --> 01:03:05.782
- Shh!

01:03:05.816 --> 01:03:07.162
Be quiet before they
make you lose yours.

01:03:21.867 --> 01:03:24.524
- Sarah will no longer
be sleeping here.

01:03:26.078 --> 01:03:27.355
She is being moved

01:03:28.839 --> 01:03:30.323
to a room of her own.

01:03:35.535 --> 01:03:36.847
You did this.

- Catherine, I can't
do this anymore.

01:04:45.398 --> 01:04:48.091
I can't do this.

01:04:48.125 --> 01:04:50.024
- We could run.

01:04:50.058 --> 01:04:51.542
Right now.

01:04:51.577 --> 01:04:53.579
- [Mary] What if Jimmy
never comes back?

01:04:55.167 --> 01:04:56.271
- [Catherine] He will.

01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:02.968
- Just keep looking
for the weak spots

01:05:03.002 --> 01:05:04.072
like we talked about.

01:05:04.970 --> 01:05:05.832

They came and got
her a while ago.

01:05:47.805 --> 01:05:50.049
We need to get out of here.

There's something
wrong with Agatha!

01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.887
Hello!

01:06:00.922 --> 01:06:02.165
- Stop screaming.

01:06:02.199 --> 01:06:03.511
- Something's not right.

01:06:03.545 --> 01:06:04.339
- What?

01:06:04.374 --> 01:06:06.031
- It hurts.

01:06:06.065 --> 01:06:07.308
- What's wrong?
- I don't know what it is.

01:06:07.342 --> 01:06:08.723
- Calm down.
- I don't know.

01:06:08.757 --> 01:06:09.793
- [Paula] Calm down.

01:06:09.827 --> 01:06:10.863
Take a deep breath.

01:06:10.897 --> 01:06:12.278
- No!

01:06:12.313 --> 01:06:13.452
- Where does it hurt?
- No, something's not right!

01:06:13.486 --> 01:06:14.349
- [Paula] If you
don't calm down you're

01:06:14.384 --> 01:06:16.282
going to hurt your baby.

01:06:16.317 --> 01:06:17.111
Calm down.

01:06:58.842 --> 01:07:02.673
[singing in foreign language]

01:07:08.058 --> 01:07:09.473
- [William] Mary.

01:07:21.071 --> 01:07:22.452
- [Mary] William.

01:07:33.256 --> 01:07:37.674
- [William] Do you know what
happened to my sailboat?

01:07:49.341 --> 01:07:50.790
- [Mary] William!

01:07:59.351 --> 01:08:00.559
- [Mother] I said aren't
you prone to seeing

01:08:00.593 --> 01:08:02.526
your little dead brother.

01:08:02.561 --> 01:08:05.633
The one you murdered
in the bathtub?

01:08:05.667 --> 01:08:06.668
- [Mary] No.

01:08:11.984 --> 01:08:14.573
[ominous music]

01:08:15.746 --> 01:08:18.024
[growling]

01:08:33.073 --> 01:08:34.386
- You killed me.

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:37.803
[creaking]

01:08:37.837 --> 01:08:39.356
Why did you kill me?

01:08:39.390 --> 01:08:41.151
Why did you kill me?

01:08:41.185 --> 01:08:43.981
[loud vibrating]

01:08:53.198 --> 01:08:54.268
- Help me!
[loud banging]

01:08:54.301 --> 01:08:55.716
Somebody help me!

01:09:12.769 --> 01:09:13.872
No.

01:09:13.908 --> 01:09:14.736
No!

01:09:15.944 --> 01:09:16.773
Jimmy!

01:09:17.705 --> 01:09:18.844
No!

01:09:18.877 --> 01:09:21.433
[loud banging]

01:09:26.196 --> 01:09:28.612
[shattering]

01:09:36.586 --> 01:09:38.035
You.

01:09:38.069 --> 01:09:39.830
You fucking monster.

01:09:39.865 --> 01:09:42.868
- Oh Agatha, you look
positively dreadful.

01:09:42.902 --> 01:09:44.524
- You killed him.

01:09:44.559 --> 01:09:46.941
- More insane ramblings.

01:09:46.975 --> 01:09:48.425
Killed who?

01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:49.254
- Jimmy.

01:09:49.287 --> 01:09:50.703
- Jimmy, he left.

01:09:50.738 --> 01:09:52.049
Don't you remember?

01:09:52.084 --> 01:09:52.912
- No, I'm leaving.

01:09:52.947 --> 01:09:54.673
I'm leaving now.

01:09:54.707 --> 01:09:57.227
- [Mother] Is this
not your signature?

01:09:57.262 --> 01:09:58.539
- Fuck you.

01:09:58.573 --> 01:10:01.507
- You see, more
anti-social behavior.

01:10:01.542 --> 01:10:03.337
You're not well Agatha.

01:10:03.371 --> 01:10:05.960
- Mary, Mary, Mary,
my name is Mary!

01:10:05.994 --> 01:10:07.962
- We have several
witnesses that will attest

01:10:07.996 --> 01:10:09.343
that this is your signature.

01:10:09.377 --> 01:10:11.241
One of them being our
own Father Andrew.

01:10:11.276 --> 01:10:12.518
- [Mary] Sit down!

01:10:12.553 --> 01:10:15.003
- Agatha, don't you
think you've wasted

01:10:15.038 --> 01:10:17.316
enough of everyone's time?

01:10:17.351 --> 01:10:19.629
Delusions, hallucinations,

01:10:19.663 --> 01:10:23.564
false memories, homicidal
ideations, insomnia.

01:10:23.598 --> 01:10:26.670
These are very serious
conditions Agatha.

01:10:26.705 --> 01:10:30.571
Which is why I also
had you sign this.

01:10:30.605 --> 01:10:32.089
Power of Attorney.

01:10:32.124 --> 01:10:34.402
Because you are
not of sound mind

01:10:34.437 --> 01:10:38.544
to make your own
legal decisions.

01:10:38.579 --> 01:10:40.719
I own you and your baby.

01:10:40.753 --> 01:10:43.480
And there's absolutely
nothing you can do about it.

01:10:43.515 --> 01:10:45.689
But for heavens sakes,
don't take my word for it.

01:10:45.724 --> 01:10:48.002
Perhaps you'd like
to call somebody hmm?

01:10:48.036 --> 01:10:51.177
I don't think Jimmy wants
to hear from you again.

01:10:51.212 --> 01:10:53.145
But perhaps the authorities.

01:10:53.179 --> 01:10:57.805
Yes, Paula, will you go
fetch a phone for Agatha?

01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:02.706
We'll just wait.

01:11:19.447 --> 01:11:20.690
Thank you Paula.

01:11:20.724 --> 01:11:21.794
There you go.

01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:27.213
Anyone you'd like.

01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:36.947
- Yes, I'd like to
report a murder.

01:11:36.982 --> 01:11:39.260
[laughing]

01:11:41.711 --> 01:11:42.781
- Yes, of course.

01:11:42.815 --> 01:11:44.507
Oh this should be very good.

01:11:44.541 --> 01:11:45.956
Yes, by all means.

01:11:45.991 --> 01:11:47.337
Tell them you've been
spending time at the convent

01:11:47.372 --> 01:11:49.270
and sleeping in a coffin

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:52.100
and attending midnight
mass with faceless nuns.

01:11:52.135 --> 01:11:54.344
And by all means,
tell them we forced

01:11:54.379 --> 01:11:57.105
you to go by the name of Agatha.

01:11:57.140 --> 01:11:59.729
All sounds a little bit
crazy to me don't you think?

01:12:00.764 --> 01:12:02.352
- Yes.

01:12:02.387 --> 01:12:03.491
Yes.

01:12:03.526 --> 01:12:04.492
The convent.

01:12:08.738 --> 01:12:09.532
Yes.

01:12:14.985 --> 01:12:17.747
[sirens blaring]

01:12:22.061 --> 01:12:22.890
Its over.

01:12:23.787 --> 01:12:25.064
Get up.

01:12:25.099 --> 01:12:25.927
Get up!

01:12:29.517 --> 01:12:31.623
[loud coughing]

01:12:31.657 --> 01:12:32.727
Open the door!

01:12:44.221 --> 01:12:45.015
- Ma'am.

01:12:45.050 --> 01:12:46.016
- Sir, please help me.

01:12:46.051 --> 01:12:47.742
- Ma'am, that's far enough.

01:12:47.777 --> 01:12:48.847
- Please help me.

01:12:48.881 --> 01:12:50.296
This woman murdered my boyfriend

01:12:50.331 --> 01:12:51.643
and she's keeping
me hostage and--

01:12:51.677 --> 01:12:53.576
- I'm so sorry officer,
she's not well.

01:12:53.610 --> 01:12:54.439
- He's upstairs.

01:12:55.301 --> 01:12:57.683
- Ma'am, may I?

01:12:57.718 --> 01:12:59.547
- I'd be disappointed
if you don't.

01:13:00.514 --> 01:13:01.894
- He's upstairs.

01:13:01.929 --> 01:13:02.861
Sir please.

01:13:02.895 --> 01:13:03.724
He's upstairs.

01:13:06.589 --> 01:13:07.935
His body was right there.

01:13:09.488 --> 01:13:10.316
What?

01:13:12.008 --> 01:13:15.287
They moved his body.

01:13:15.321 --> 01:13:17.772
[loud coughing]

01:13:17.807 --> 01:13:19.912
I don't know what's
real anymore.

01:13:19.947 --> 01:13:21.189
I see things.

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:25.021
That's not me,
that's not my voice.

01:13:25.055 --> 01:13:26.229
I mean, I don't know how she--

01:13:26.263 --> 01:13:27.955
I killed my brother.

01:13:27.989 --> 01:13:28.783
What?

01:13:28.818 --> 01:13:29.750
No, I didn't say that.

01:13:29.784 --> 01:13:31.268
I would never say that!

01:13:31.303 --> 01:13:33.547
I didn't kill him,
he drowned but,

01:13:33.581 --> 01:13:35.376
why are you looking
at me like that?

01:13:35.411 --> 01:13:36.550
I'm not crazy.

01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:38.862
- What happened to her head?

01:13:38.897 --> 01:13:40.761
- She has a pension
for hurting herself.

01:13:40.795 --> 01:13:42.866
This happened shortly
before you arrived.

01:13:42.901 --> 01:13:44.212
- No!

01:13:44.247 --> 01:13:45.006
- We simply haven't gotten
- No, shut up!

01:13:45.041 --> 01:13:45.800
- Her cleaned up yet.

01:13:45.835 --> 01:13:46.732
- She did this to me!

01:13:46.767 --> 01:13:48.009
She's lying.

01:13:48.044 --> 01:13:49.804
- You can see she's delusional.

01:13:49.839 --> 01:13:51.150
She was sent here.

01:13:51.185 --> 01:13:53.463
In there you'll find
a Power of Attorney.

01:13:53.498 --> 01:13:55.258
She signed it over to us.

01:13:56.604 --> 01:13:57.433
- [Mary] I don't remember--

01:13:57.467 --> 01:13:58.364
- Over there.

01:13:58.399 --> 01:14:00.056
- It's a sad case actually.

01:14:00.090 --> 01:14:02.092
The father of the
child wants absolutely

01:14:02.127 --> 01:14:03.542
nothing to do with her.

01:14:05.268 --> 01:14:07.304
Paula, may I have
Jimmy's letters please?

01:14:10.515 --> 01:14:11.481
Thank you.

01:14:11.516 --> 01:14:12.724
There you go.

01:14:12.758 --> 01:14:14.208
- That's not even
his handwriting!

01:14:14.242 --> 01:14:15.312
Look, these are all fake.

01:14:15.347 --> 01:14:16.452
They're all fake!

01:14:16.486 --> 01:14:17.660
She wrote these.

01:14:17.694 --> 01:14:19.455
- You see what we
have to put up with?

01:14:22.596 --> 01:14:24.321
- [Narrator] Earl, what are
you doing out of the house?

01:14:25.599 --> 01:14:26.807
- No.

01:14:26.841 --> 01:14:28.015
- [Father] Are you okay miss?

01:14:28.049 --> 01:14:29.257
Whoa, your head.

01:14:29.292 --> 01:14:30.120
- No.

01:14:31.052 --> 01:14:32.260
No, he's a part of this!

01:14:34.124 --> 01:14:39.129
She controls him!
[light humming]

01:14:39.854 --> 01:14:41.373
He's in on all of this!

01:14:41.407 --> 01:14:43.927
He's a fraud, he's a priest!

01:14:43.962 --> 01:14:45.481
- Sister, we gotta
get her to a hospital

01:14:45.515 --> 01:14:46.654
as soon as we can.

01:14:46.689 --> 01:14:48.000
- Sheriff, the doctor
was called shortly

01:14:48.035 --> 01:14:48.967
before we called you.

01:14:49.001 --> 01:14:50.209
He's on his way.

01:14:51.417 --> 01:14:52.557
- [Father] Earl, let's
get you home alright.

01:14:52.591 --> 01:14:54.559
- Officer, I run a
convent where the health

01:14:54.593 --> 01:14:56.630
of my girls is paramount.

01:14:56.664 --> 01:14:57.872
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask

01:14:57.907 --> 01:15:00.461
you to leave and go
home and get well.

01:15:02.567 --> 01:15:03.395
- Of course.

01:15:04.845 --> 01:15:07.503
[ominous music]

01:15:09.643 --> 01:15:10.713
- She's in labor.

01:15:11.852 --> 01:15:13.370
- [Mother] Take her
to the basement.

01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:15.890
- No, no, no!

01:15:17.582 --> 01:15:21.655
[whispering in foreign language]

01:15:25.797 --> 01:15:29.628
[singing in foreign language]

01:15:39.707 --> 01:15:42.054
[screaming]

01:15:53.687 --> 01:15:55.758
- [Narrator] Your name is

01:15:57.587 --> 01:15:58.415
Agatha.

01:15:59.416 --> 01:16:04.007
[screaming]
[crushing]

01:16:14.846 --> 01:16:17.952
[melancholy humming]

01:16:22.129 --> 01:16:24.269
- Where are you taking him?
[baby crying]

01:16:24.303 --> 01:16:25.891
Where are you taking him?

01:16:25.926 --> 01:16:26.720
Please don't take my--

01:16:26.754 --> 01:16:29.101
[screaming]

01:16:31.517 --> 01:16:33.761
[light humming]

01:16:33.796 --> 01:16:34.900
- Mr. And Mrs. Wright,

01:16:36.074 --> 01:16:37.385
I have something for you.

01:16:38.352 --> 01:16:39.180
Paula.

01:16:42.667 --> 01:16:44.600
- [Mrs. Wright] Our
daughter will love him.

01:17:17.218 --> 01:17:21.050
[singing in foreign language]

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:27.159
- [Susan] She wants to see you.

01:17:34.719 --> 01:17:35.823
She's here.

01:17:38.205 --> 01:17:39.447
- Thank you sister Susan.

01:17:40.621 --> 01:17:44.452
Sister, would you
ask Sarah to please

01:17:44.487 --> 01:17:46.075
bring me a glass of ice water.

01:17:47.421 --> 01:17:50.355
And bring one for Agatha,
she looks thirsty.

01:18:00.848 --> 01:18:03.989
This whole garden is teaming
with rats and snakes.

01:18:05.957 --> 01:18:08.476
- You're just going to
kill me after I give birth.

01:18:09.339 --> 01:18:10.306
- I don't have to.

01:18:12.584 --> 01:18:15.276
You have no idea how long
I have waited for this.

01:18:17.037 --> 01:18:18.590
You can't run anymore.

01:18:19.764 --> 01:18:22.283
You have no connection
to anyone or anything.

01:18:23.146 --> 01:18:24.872
You're broken and damaged.

01:18:26.322 --> 01:18:27.910
You've already killed one child.

01:18:29.187 --> 01:18:30.464
Now the only thing
that's holding you back

01:18:30.498 --> 01:18:32.190
is your own selfish
stubbornness.

01:18:35.572 --> 01:18:37.609
Can't you see this
is not for you.

01:18:39.197 --> 01:18:40.301
Wasn't for me either.

01:18:43.511 --> 01:18:45.168
You've seen what I'm capable of.

01:18:46.342 --> 01:18:48.447
What kind of a mother
do you think I'd be?

01:18:48.482 --> 01:18:50.311
This is not who we are.

01:18:51.485 --> 01:18:52.451
- You're right.

01:18:52.486 --> 01:18:53.936
- Of course I'm right.

01:18:53.970 --> 01:18:55.213
And there's a wonderful family

01:18:55.247 --> 01:18:57.767
just waiting to take
care of your child.

01:18:57.802 --> 01:18:58.872
- And pay you for it.

01:19:02.807 --> 01:19:03.635
The donors.

01:19:05.188 --> 01:19:06.672
You sell our babies.

01:19:08.191 --> 01:19:10.573
Do they know that this
is not a real convent?

01:19:10.607 --> 01:19:13.231
- Well now, that's a
matter of perspective.

01:19:15.302 --> 01:19:18.615
They don't know that my
church turned it's back on me.

01:19:18.650 --> 01:19:22.240
They do know that I'm
continuing to do God's work.

01:19:22.274 --> 01:19:24.932
It didn't take much for me
to be able to stay here.

01:19:24.967 --> 01:19:26.831
Church didn't want
a crumbling relic.

01:19:27.901 --> 01:19:30.455
So I continued to do their work.

01:19:31.939 --> 01:19:33.665
Only I'm turning a profit.

01:19:36.461 --> 01:19:40.706
Susan, Helen, and Olga,
have become far too greedy.

01:19:43.088 --> 01:19:45.366
Sarah's too simple to
be good for anything

01:19:45.401 --> 01:19:46.816
other than manual labor.

01:19:46.851 --> 01:19:48.714
And that of course leaves Paula.

01:19:48.749 --> 01:19:50.751
And I can barely stand her.

01:19:53.271 --> 01:19:56.446
But there are going to be
so many women coming to me.

01:19:56.481 --> 01:19:57.689
I'm going to need help.

01:19:59.864 --> 01:20:00.761
- Would I be paid?

01:20:02.487 --> 01:20:04.489
- Well of course.

01:20:04.523 --> 01:20:05.490
And handsomely.

01:20:06.732 --> 01:20:08.942
I always take care of
everyone in my employ.

01:20:09.874 --> 01:20:11.185
I'm not running a charity.

01:20:14.913 --> 01:20:16.087
- [Mary] Do you have
proof that these

01:20:16.121 --> 01:20:17.364
children have gone
to good homes?

01:20:18.606 --> 01:20:19.504
- Of course.

01:20:24.543 --> 01:20:28.547
This ledge contains
records of every child

01:20:28.582 --> 01:20:29.859
that I've ever given away.

01:20:31.481 --> 01:20:34.139
As you can see,
they're much better off

01:20:34.174 --> 01:20:36.866
than they would have been
with their pathetic mothers.

01:20:40.732 --> 01:20:43.390
[ominous music]

01:20:47.912 --> 01:20:49.534
You have 24 hours to decide.

01:20:50.742 --> 01:20:54.953
Paula, please fetch
Agatha some supper

01:20:54.988 --> 01:20:56.472
and then take her to her room.

01:21:13.592 --> 01:21:15.974
[shattering]

01:21:18.114 --> 01:21:19.288
- I think I'm,

01:21:20.427 --> 01:21:25.190
I think I'm...
[heavy breathing]

01:21:27.503 --> 01:21:29.470
- I understand that
you are frustrated.

01:21:29.505 --> 01:21:30.713
I hear it in your voice,

01:21:30.747 --> 01:21:31.956
but you promised me
that I would have

01:21:31.990 --> 01:21:33.198
at least until Spring to pay.

01:21:33.233 --> 01:21:34.820
- Mother.

01:21:34.855 --> 01:21:36.201
It's Agatha, it's time.

01:21:43.174 --> 01:21:46.694
- I think it was
just pain, I'm fine.

01:21:46.729 --> 01:21:48.593
It was just pain.

01:21:48.627 --> 01:21:51.665
I think, I'm sorry
about the food.

01:21:51.699 --> 01:21:53.425
- [Mother] You alright Agatha?

01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:54.254
- [Mary] Yeah.

01:21:54.288 --> 01:21:55.117
- Alright.

01:21:56.256 --> 01:21:59.569
Paula, will you take
Agatha back to the room

01:21:59.604 --> 01:22:01.261
and get her another
plate of food?

01:22:05.196 --> 01:22:05.990
- Sorry.

01:22:32.982 --> 01:22:35.743
[loud whooshing]

01:22:39.713 --> 01:22:41.957
[clanking]

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.381
- [Mother] Paula, would
you come here please?

01:23:35.941 --> 01:23:37.081
Is Agatha asleep?

01:23:37.115 --> 01:23:38.944
- [Paula] Yes
mother, she's asleep.

01:23:38.979 --> 01:23:40.360
- [Mother] Are you sure?

01:23:40.394 --> 01:23:41.809
- [Paula] Yes.

01:23:41.844 --> 01:23:43.949
- [Mother] I want you to
make sure she stays that way.

01:23:43.984 --> 01:23:45.261
- [Paula] Yes I understand.

01:23:45.296 --> 01:23:47.746
- [Mother] She's been
quite disappointing.

01:23:49.748 --> 01:23:51.888
Hit her over the
head if you have to.

01:23:51.923 --> 01:23:54.063
- [Paula] Yes
mother, I understand.

01:23:54.098 --> 01:23:55.927
I'll take care of her.

01:24:16.051 --> 01:24:17.190
[clanking]

01:24:17.224 --> 01:24:18.053
Hello?

01:24:19.778 --> 01:24:20.779
Sister Susan?

01:25:51.146 --> 01:25:52.285
[creaking]

01:25:52.319 --> 01:25:53.044
Shall I bring Sarah
her supper now?

01:25:53.078 --> 01:25:53.907
- [Mother] No.

01:25:55.322 --> 01:25:57.876
Just keep her where she
is for the next few days.

01:25:58.739 --> 01:26:00.224
She needs to learn her lesson.

01:26:01.742 --> 01:26:03.744
- [Paula] Yes of
course, I understand.

01:26:06.195 --> 01:26:07.783
- [Mother] Keep her door locked.

01:26:09.164 --> 01:26:11.821
Stupid girl won't know
anything's different anyway.

01:26:13.029 --> 01:26:14.099
- [Paula] Yes I agree.

01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:16.826
- [Mother] I'm
leaving it up to you.

01:26:18.552 --> 01:26:23.074
[loud cracking]
[bells ringing]

01:26:23.108 --> 01:26:25.594
[faint sobbing]

01:26:25.628 --> 01:26:29.080
- [Mother] I want you
to start going out.

01:26:33.533 --> 01:26:35.259
- [Paula] Goodnight mother.

01:26:35.293 --> 01:26:36.570
- [Mother] Paula.

01:26:36.605 --> 01:26:38.020
- [Paula] Yes.

01:26:38.054 --> 01:26:40.505
- [Mother] When Agatha leaves,
we're going to be empty.

01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:43.715
I need you to start
scouring the countryside.

01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:46.062
No cripples, no handicaps.

01:27:11.433 --> 01:27:13.642

01:28:22.883 --> 01:28:24.575
- I found this.

01:28:24.609 --> 01:28:26.024
Your son is alive.

01:28:29.131 --> 01:28:30.546
They've been gas-lighting us.

01:28:32.652 --> 01:28:33.998
I need your help now.

01:28:38.382 --> 01:28:41.039
[light humming]

01:28:45.389 --> 01:28:47.011
- It's a little
light this month.

01:28:49.254 --> 01:28:50.980
I regret to say this
may be your last

01:28:51.015 --> 01:28:53.224
payment for a while.

01:29:11.449 --> 01:29:13.348
- Get me out of here

01:29:13.382 --> 01:29:15.729
and I will make it
worth your while.

01:29:23.772 --> 01:29:28.777

01:30:25.454 --> 01:30:26.973
Where's Paula?

01:30:27.007 --> 01:30:30.010
[suspenseful music]

01:30:35.913 --> 01:30:37.017
Did you take my money?

01:30:38.916 --> 01:30:41.332
You ungrateful son...

01:30:41.366 --> 01:30:43.783
Get your hands off
me you bitches!

01:30:43.817 --> 01:30:45.750
- [Susan] Stop talking!

01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:49.478
- God damn you!

[ominous music]

01:31:17.333 --> 01:31:18.231

01:31:20.336 --> 01:31:22.477
You have no idea who I am.

01:31:23.512 --> 01:31:25.514

01:31:27.827 --> 01:31:29.035

No, stop it!

01:31:30.174 --> 01:31:31.520
No, come on, no!

Agatha!

01:32:13.907 --> 01:32:15.737
- Susan, Susan I took
you off the street!

01:32:15.771 --> 01:32:16.945
I took you off the street!

01:32:16.979 --> 01:32:17.808
Olga, I took you in
when none of your family

01:32:17.842 --> 01:32:19.188
didn't even want you!

01:32:19.223 --> 01:32:20.224
God damn it!

No Paula stop.

01:32:51.427 --> 01:32:52.497

- Stop lying.

01:33:00.851 --> 01:33:01.955
- You can be the hero.

01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:03.198
You can deliver this baby

01:33:03.232 --> 01:33:04.993
and do whatever you want
with me, just please,

01:33:05.027 --> 01:33:07.029
