00:02.603 --> 00:05.904
♪ ♪

00:46.013 --> 00:48.280
(pendrick): To live in the
modern world is to bear witness

00:48.282 --> 00:50.215
To an unfolding miracle.

00:50.251 --> 00:54.019
A short while ago, information
moved at the speed of a ship.

00:54.154 --> 00:56.688
Now it moves at
the speed of light

00:56.690 --> 00:59.958
Across a telegraph network
that spans the globe.

01:00.027 --> 01:03.428
A letter written in toronto
can be printed in new york,

01:03.431 --> 01:05.030
As can images.

01:05.032 --> 01:08.967
Now imagine doing all that from
the comfort of your home

01:09.036 --> 01:11.904
Without the use of
a telegraph operator.

01:12.039 --> 01:15.707
Sending the message to a friend
on another continent

01:15.709 --> 01:18.644
And receiving
a reply within seconds.

01:18.779 --> 01:21.313
Impossible, you say?

01:21.382 --> 01:23.982
But the technology
already exists.

01:24.118 --> 01:26.751
All it took to put it together
was some imagination

01:26.821 --> 01:27.920
And a little bit of money.

01:29.123 --> 01:30.322
Make that a lot of money.

01:30.391 --> 01:31.556
(all laugh)

01:35.296 --> 01:37.062
(all gasp)

01:37.197 --> 01:38.530
This is the pendrick portal.

01:38.665 --> 01:39.932
It's a window into
a world we're calling

01:40.067 --> 01:42.167
Pendrick's
planetary parlour.

01:42.169 --> 01:44.068
Please, step forward.
Don't be shy.

01:45.005 --> 01:46.771
It appears I'm receiving
a message.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.775
Would you look at that, it's
our chief operating officer,

01:50.811 --> 01:53.678
Garth trent, from his home
in parkdale, ontario.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.016
(electronic beep)

01:58.018 --> 01:59.017
Another message.

01:59.053 --> 02:01.953
This one appears to be
from France.

02:02.022 --> 02:04.056
It's my friend jacques
from gay paree.

02:04.058 --> 02:06.558
(all laugh and applaud)

02:06.693 --> 02:08.360
<i> Bonjour,</i> jacques.

02:08.362 --> 02:09.828
<i> Ça va bien?</i>

02:10.631 --> 02:11.897
(electronic beep)

02:11.966 --> 02:13.331
Another message.

02:13.367 --> 02:16.735
From mr. Cormac, one of our
parlour users here in toronto.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.504
You're sending worry?

02:19.540 --> 02:21.206
I think we've got enough
of that already.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.308
(all laugh)

02:23.443 --> 02:25.511
(ticking, then electronic beep)

02:25.646 --> 02:27.312
(gasps)

02:28.215 --> 02:29.815
Or should we be
worried that--

02:29.950 --> 02:31.416
- W-what's happening?

02:31.452 --> 02:33.851
- Dear god! Mr. Cormac's being
murdered before our very eyes.

02:33.888 --> 02:35.086
(all gasp)

02:35.156 --> 02:36.188
Struthers!

02:36.323 --> 02:37.722
- What should I do?

02:37.791 --> 02:39.457
- Call station house
number four.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.993
Tell them to send
detective murdoch.

02:40.995 --> 02:42.026
- Yes, sir.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.665
(electronic beep)

02:54.742 --> 02:57.943
Were all witness to a murder

02:58.012 --> 02:59.945
That happened
across town.

03:00.014 --> 03:02.480
- Across town?
Then why are we here?

03:02.516 --> 03:05.016
- Because this is where
they witnessed the murder.

03:05.085 --> 03:06.351
- How can that be?

03:06.486 --> 03:08.687
- Sir, when james pendrick
is involved...

03:08.689 --> 03:10.955
- Detective murdoch.
Constable crabtree.

03:10.991 --> 03:12.424
Thank you for
coming so quickly.

03:12.493 --> 03:13.892
- James pendrick.

03:13.894 --> 03:16.294
- I believe you've met
ernest harding.

03:16.330 --> 03:20.298
- Ah, yes. You created a version
of babbage's difference engine.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.634
- Analytic engine, actually.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.436
And people often
make that mistake.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.838
- Mr. Harding's machine
is an integral component

03:26.840 --> 03:28.306
To my latest venture.

03:28.342 --> 03:31.243
- And just what
is that venture, james,

03:31.245 --> 03:33.645
And how does it
involve murder?

03:33.681 --> 03:36.381
- It might be easier
to show than to tell.

03:39.786 --> 03:41.119
(electronic sounds)

03:41.255 --> 03:43.322
- What on earth is this device?

03:43.457 --> 03:46.258
- Images and text
are processed by the computer

03:46.327 --> 03:47.792
And then transmitted
to local receivers,

03:47.828 --> 03:49.460
Which are connected
to a network.

03:49.496 --> 03:51.263
We call it
cellular telegraphy.

03:51.265 --> 03:53.365
- I've retrieved
the transmission of the murder.

03:55.202 --> 03:56.401
- I-it's been recorded?

03:56.536 --> 03:58.870
- All our transmissions
are first recorded

03:58.906 --> 04:00.205
To a coil of
magnetic wire.

04:00.340 --> 04:01.306
(electronic beep)

04:02.409 --> 04:03.942
- What am I looking at here?

04:04.077 --> 04:05.310
- Electrons, murdoch.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.279
(clears throat)

04:07.348 --> 04:09.081
- What am I looking at
in this image

04:09.216 --> 04:10.616
And, more importantly,
who is this?

04:10.751 --> 04:12.884
(pendrick):
His name is vincent cormac.

04:12.886 --> 04:15.020
He was a participant
in our face space.

04:15.022 --> 04:16.421
- Face space?

04:17.491 --> 04:19.424
- When a group of people
gather together

04:19.426 --> 04:22.226
In a mutual conversation,
we call it a chat space.

04:22.263 --> 04:24.963
When they transmit images,
we call it a face space.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.431
It's just marketing.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.699
- Ah.

04:27.735 --> 04:30.035
And how well do you know
this mr. Cormac?

04:30.104 --> 04:32.837
- I didn't. He was chosen at
random to participate.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.906
- He was a professor
of mathematics.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.641
I'd met him a few times.

04:37.244 --> 04:38.210
(whirring)

04:38.345 --> 04:40.646
- "worry, I'm sending it."

04:40.781 --> 04:43.114
- It's a bit cryptic but
clearly, he was under duress.

04:43.150 --> 04:44.249
- A warning, perhaps?

04:44.318 --> 04:47.218
(whirring, then beeping)

04:47.254 --> 04:48.453
- Good lord!

04:49.723 --> 04:52.057
Sir, could this be
some sort of hoax?

04:52.059 --> 04:53.859
- Possibly.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.294
Where did this happen?
We should go there now.

04:56.363 --> 04:58.463
- Garth trent, our chief
operating officer,

04:58.532 --> 04:59.664
Would have
that information.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.667
He was also part of
the face space. Struthers!

05:01.802 --> 05:02.968
- Yes, sir?

05:02.970 --> 05:04.602
- Have you contacted
mr. Trent?

05:04.672 --> 05:06.271
- He telephoned.
He's on his way.

05:06.406 --> 05:07.605
- Very good. Thank you.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.474
(electronic sounds)

05:10.477 --> 05:11.743
- What's this now?

05:11.878 --> 05:15.147
- Sir, that looks like the grin
of the cheshire cat.

05:15.282 --> 05:17.349
- It could be
the killer's icon.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.351
- Icon?

05:19.353 --> 05:20.651
- His representative symbol.

05:20.688 --> 05:23.355
Lately our users have
taken to using icons

05:23.490 --> 05:24.689
Instead of their faces.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.425
(trent):
I came as soon as I could.

05:26.560 --> 05:27.826
(pendrick):
Detective murdoch,

05:27.828 --> 05:30.562
This is our chief operating
officer, garth trent,

05:30.564 --> 05:31.829
And the son
of our main investor.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.431
- Pleasure.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.200
I take it you know
where this happened.

05:35.202 --> 05:38.770
- Mr. Cormac's address is listed
as 247 agnes street.

05:38.806 --> 05:41.306
- Sir, that's miss beazley's
boarding house.

05:41.308 --> 05:42.240
It's just around the corner.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.259
- Who are you?

06:01.261 --> 06:03.795
- Oh, margaret brackenreid.
I'm just here to assist.

06:03.930 --> 06:04.996
- Brackenreid.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.198
I know that name.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.267
- My husband's
a police inspector.

06:09.336 --> 06:11.269
- They were looking for bobby.

06:11.938 --> 06:13.338
And they found him.

06:14.541 --> 06:15.807
- What?

06:18.211 --> 06:19.243
(sighs)

06:21.849 --> 06:23.181
- It's number 13.

06:24.385 --> 06:25.484
(sighs)

06:25.619 --> 06:26.685
(knocking on door)

06:26.820 --> 06:28.286
- Mr. Cormac? Police.

06:35.128 --> 06:37.895
- So, not a hoax.
- No.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.505
- Sir. Take a look at this.

06:49.176 --> 06:50.208
What is it?

06:51.378 --> 06:53.378
- Well, he was a mathematician,

06:53.380 --> 06:56.114
But this seems much more
diagrammatic in nature.

06:57.717 --> 07:00.185
George, notify mrs. Hart
that we have a victim,

07:00.254 --> 07:02.521
Bring mr. Cormac's machine
to the station house

07:02.523 --> 07:04.790
And take
a photograph of this.

07:04.925 --> 07:05.991
- Sir.

07:10.297 --> 07:11.463
- Very good, george.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.732
Could you copy this onto
my blackboard

07:13.734 --> 07:16.134
Exactly as it's depicted
in the photograph?

07:16.269 --> 07:18.470
- Sir, I was going to go down to
miss beazley's boarding house

07:18.605 --> 07:20.939
And dust for fingermarks,
take some statements.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.940
- I can do that.
Agnes street, isn't it?

07:24.277 --> 07:25.410
- Thank you.

07:28.315 --> 07:29.547
(sighs)

07:30.651 --> 07:32.483
Have you gained access
to the machine yet?

07:32.519 --> 07:33.685
- Not yet.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.353
- We need to reconfigure
the passcode manually.

07:35.489 --> 07:36.488
- What's in here, then?

07:36.623 --> 07:39.924
- Hopefully mr. Cormac's
latest transmissions.

07:41.328 --> 07:43.295
- So you can send a message to
anyone in the world with this?

07:43.430 --> 07:45.230
- If they have a portal, yes.

07:45.299 --> 07:46.764
- We currently have
a thousand machines.

07:46.834 --> 07:49.367
We want to make that a million.
And then a billion.

07:49.436 --> 07:51.302
- You're not half ambitious,
james.

07:51.338 --> 07:53.638
- I want to bring the world
together, inspector.

07:53.773 --> 07:56.441
The free exchange of ideas
between people and peoples.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.043
- I just want to send a message
without talking to anyone.

07:59.112 --> 08:01.279
-(crabtree): Oh, but sir, it
could be so much more than that.

08:01.281 --> 08:04.249
I mean, if anyone can send
a message to anyone,

08:04.251 --> 08:06.651
Then, presumably,
anyone can send a message...

08:06.653 --> 08:07.852
To everyone!

08:09.122 --> 08:11.690
Books could be transmitted.
Newspapers. Sports scores.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.858
If images could be transmitted,

08:13.894 --> 08:16.595
What's to keep you from
browsing the eaton's catalogue,

08:16.730 --> 08:19.397
Placing your order directly
from a pendrick portal?

08:19.399 --> 08:22.000
- Well, george, I hardly think
people will want to read a book

08:22.069 --> 08:23.267
From such a device.

08:23.303 --> 08:24.869
(pendrick):
What else do you see?

08:24.938 --> 08:27.405
- Why not a global university?

08:27.441 --> 08:28.974
You could attend from anywhere,

08:28.976 --> 08:30.675
A treehouse,
a lighthouse, a yurt.

08:31.411 --> 08:32.810
- Come work for me.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.313
- Uh, but, sir,
I already have a job.

08:35.382 --> 08:37.415
- I'll double your salary.
- Oy!

08:37.484 --> 08:39.417
- You're right, tom.
I'll triple it.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.287
You think about it,
mr. Crabtree.

08:42.289 --> 08:43.622
-(harding):
I've gained access.

08:45.492 --> 08:46.625
(electronic sounds)

08:46.760 --> 08:48.626
I haven't been able
to get into two sections.

08:48.695 --> 08:49.894
- What? Why?

08:50.030 --> 08:52.831
- Ah, mr. Cormac seems to have
reconfigured his machine

08:52.833 --> 08:54.299
To prevent access.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.167
I need to override
his instructions.

08:56.303 --> 09:00.271
Are you able to imprint
to paper what you have thus far?

09:01.308 --> 09:02.740
- I appreciate you
coming to pick me up.

09:02.776 --> 09:05.176
- Excuse me, mrs. Farrow.
- Hm?

09:06.179 --> 09:08.246
What do you know about my son?

09:08.315 --> 09:10.448
- You?
- Bobby.

09:10.450 --> 09:11.749
Bobby brackenreid.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.854
- I've never heard of him.

09:15.989 --> 09:18.089
- You mentioned him by name.
- Margaret!

09:19.293 --> 09:20.324
Not now.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.329
(sighs)

09:25.732 --> 09:27.498
- You must be so excited.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.402
- Is that what this feeling is?
- Isn't it?

09:31.772 --> 09:33.871
- Well, I don't know, effie.
It's a big change.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.740
Permanent change.

09:35.875 --> 09:36.875
And then, you know,

09:37.010 --> 09:39.410
There's my friendship
with detective murdoch.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.613
- I'm sure your friendship
will survive.

09:43.149 --> 09:45.282
You'll just have to get used
to calling him william.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.787
(both laugh)

09:49.856 --> 09:51.889
- I don't think
I'll ever do that.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.925
- According to
the transmission log,

09:53.927 --> 09:56.094
Mr. Cormac's previous
communication

09:56.229 --> 09:58.630
Was at 2:34 p.M.

09:58.699 --> 10:01.899
It says, "don't worry.
I'm sending it now."

10:01.969 --> 10:05.170
If the killer was able
to send his own icon,

10:05.172 --> 10:08.306
Then he was likely
a parlour user himself.

10:08.375 --> 10:09.441
- Icon?

10:11.044 --> 10:12.043
(brackenreid): Ah.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.645
- Well, I've spoken to
everyone

10:13.714 --> 10:16.180
At mr. Cormac's boarding house,
no sightings.

10:16.216 --> 10:20.719
But his neighbour heard someone
walk past her door at 2:30.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.253
- Heard? That could be anybody.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.789
- Well, if it was the killer,

10:24.791 --> 10:28.460
That's one full half hour
before the murder.

10:28.595 --> 10:31.062
And if the neighbour heard no
sign of a disturbance,

10:31.197 --> 10:33.331
Then it was likely someone
known to mr. Cormac.

10:34.601 --> 10:37.402
- Success? Gather round,
we may have something here!

10:37.471 --> 10:40.405
- I've managed to access
some of the blocked sections.

10:43.610 --> 10:44.809
(brackenreid):
Bloody hell. He's naked.

10:44.944 --> 10:48.279
Small wonder he wanted
to keep that hidden.

10:48.281 --> 10:49.147
(chuckles)

10:49.149 --> 10:50.682
(knock on the door)

10:50.817 --> 10:52.751
- Uh, sorry to interrupt.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.620
Uh, detective, inspector
might I have a word?

11:06.600 --> 11:09.100
Sirs, as you both know,
six years ago

11:09.235 --> 11:12.337
I withheld information
during an investigation.

11:12.472 --> 11:15.740
At the time, it was to protect
edna garrison and her son.

11:15.875 --> 11:18.409
But I was told
because of that,

11:18.445 --> 11:20.645
I would never
make detective.

11:22.282 --> 11:23.848
Is that still the case?

11:25.986 --> 11:28.453
- I can't honestly say
it isn't, crabtree.

11:32.325 --> 11:34.459
- Right. Well, I appreciate
your honesty, sir.

11:34.528 --> 11:37.661
- George,
mr. Pendrick's ventures

11:37.698 --> 11:39.330
Seldom work out.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.132
- Yes, I'm aware of that.

11:42.435 --> 11:45.169
And I thank you both for
everything you've done for me.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.013
- Would have been
the last moment I saw him.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.815
- Tearing a bookcase apart.
- I agree.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.082
- Uh, mr. Pendrick.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.918
If your offer still stands,
I accept.

12:01.888 --> 12:04.155
- Wonderful.
I am so pleased.

12:04.191 --> 12:07.024
Harding, meet our new director
of creative development.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.959
- Oh, well, welcome aboard,
mr. Crabtree.

12:08.995 --> 12:10.094
- Thank you.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.563
- Congratulations, george.
- I'll bloody miss you.

12:12.599 --> 12:14.365
But you never heard
that from me, bugalugs.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.835
- Our loss is their gain.
Good luck.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.603
- I wish it was me
that was leaving.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.708
- Right. Well, a pint then,
to celebrate.

12:23.710 --> 12:26.111
- Oh, not tonight, crabtree.
We've got a case to solve, hm?

12:26.246 --> 12:28.112
- Let's discuss this.

12:28.115 --> 12:29.513
- Higgins, when you're done?

12:29.549 --> 12:31.916
- They have me doing
your job as well.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.586
- Right. Well, uh...

12:34.721 --> 12:38.923
Another time, then, and, uh,
and best of luck with the case.

12:42.729 --> 12:44.061
(clears throat)

12:45.098 --> 12:46.264
- Right, then.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.466
- So, cormac was trading
in pornography?

12:48.601 --> 12:50.134
- Not just pornography.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.270
There were conversations
about adulterous liaisons

12:52.339 --> 12:53.471
And prostitution.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.940
- Not just a mathematics
professor.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.208
- Hmm.

12:57.343 --> 12:58.943
- I don't want pendrick's
parlour to be associated

12:59.012 --> 13:00.011
With this type of business.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.412
Is there anything
we could do about it?

13:02.382 --> 13:03.514
- Hey!

13:09.623 --> 13:11.489
- It's the decon-recon sequence.

13:11.558 --> 13:12.823
- The what?

13:12.859 --> 13:15.626
- For reasons of security,
outgoing messages are scrambled

13:15.695 --> 13:17.128
With a simple algorithm.

13:17.197 --> 13:18.329
This is it.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.098
- How did cormac get it?

13:20.100 --> 13:22.567
- Well, he figured it out.
He's a mathematician.

13:22.569 --> 13:24.235
He should never have been
given a portal.

13:24.370 --> 13:26.838
(pendrick): So, he had access
to every transmission,

13:26.973 --> 13:28.973
Every private conversation.

13:28.975 --> 13:31.242
- A peeping tom, then?
- Perhaps.

13:31.278 --> 13:33.678
But why did he record only
the transmissions

13:33.680 --> 13:36.380
That were potentially
damaging to the senders?

13:36.416 --> 13:38.249
- He was blackmailing them.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.385
Bloody hell. There's your
motive right there, murdoch.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.127
- Dear god!

13:51.298 --> 13:53.197
People sent
these to each other?

13:54.267 --> 13:56.601
- They assumed
the exchanges were private.

13:56.736 --> 14:01.272
- Well, I have a photograph or
two I could send to you.

14:01.308 --> 14:02.907
(both laugh)

14:04.544 --> 14:06.577
So you think he was
compiling all of these

14:06.613 --> 14:07.879
For blackmail purposes?

14:07.948 --> 14:11.749
- He recorded these separately
from his other transmissions.

14:11.785 --> 14:13.618
- What were they about?

14:13.687 --> 14:15.620
- Mundane things.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.021
Cats.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.289
Pictures of cats.

14:18.424 --> 14:19.823
Jokes about cats.

14:19.860 --> 14:22.960
And cormac wasn't the only one,
nearly everybody.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.896
- Well, how odd.
I wonder why.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.897
- George will have a theory.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.570
- How are you
feeling about that?

14:32.639 --> 14:34.204
- Feeling?

14:36.309 --> 14:39.877
I wish him all the luck in
the world in his new venture.

14:41.147 --> 14:42.813
- You'll still be friends,
william.

15:06.806 --> 15:08.472
- Morning, detective.

15:08.541 --> 15:10.675
- Have you been here all night?

15:10.677 --> 15:12.209
(pendrick):
We're just wrapping up.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.545
We gained access to the final
blocked section.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.380
- I printed off the contents.

15:19.085 --> 15:21.218
- A cipher?
- Ah, not a cipher.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.288
But a code of some kind.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.122
- But why encode it
in the first place?

15:26.493 --> 15:29.494
- Perhaps he feared that
if he could spy on others,

15:29.496 --> 15:31.362
Others could spy on him?

15:31.398 --> 15:32.530
(electronic buzzes and beeps)

15:32.665 --> 15:33.798
(pendrick): What is happening?

15:33.933 --> 15:35.767
- Someone's taking control
of the machine.

15:35.769 --> 15:36.834
- How?
I don't know,

15:36.903 --> 15:37.969
But he's erasing
the recorder!

15:37.971 --> 15:39.536
- Quickly, pull the plug!

15:40.941 --> 15:44.575
Do you mean to tell me that
the intruder can not only spy

15:44.711 --> 15:46.910
On our face space
transmissions,

15:46.947 --> 15:49.913
But they have access
to the actual machine?

15:49.950 --> 15:52.249
- That's why each machine
is protected with a passcode.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.684
- A passcode?

15:53.720 --> 15:56.654
- A secret key, a passcode
known only to the user.

15:56.723 --> 15:59.990
- So, someone knows
mr. Cormac's passcode,

16:00.660 --> 16:01.859
Possibly the killer.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.196
- I'm going to have to take this
machine back to headquarters

16:05.331 --> 16:07.164
And analyze it.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.214
- Right, then.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.449
Begin.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.989
(laughs)

16:32.792 --> 16:34.625
My goodness.
I don't know.

16:34.694 --> 16:37.495
What are my options?

16:43.169 --> 16:45.503
(struthers):
George crabtree, I presume.

16:45.572 --> 16:48.372
- Ah, yes. We met yesterday.
- Not by name.

16:48.375 --> 16:51.575
I'm melody struthers,
assistant machine instructor.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.577
- I'm not sure what that means.

16:53.646 --> 16:56.714
- It means I write coded
instructions for the machines

16:56.783 --> 16:58.783
And professor harding
gets the credit.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.117
- Ah!

17:00.153 --> 17:01.452
- This used to be his desk.

17:01.587 --> 17:04.021
I'm over there in
the operations section.

17:04.024 --> 17:05.689
We'll be working together.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.991
You come up
with brilliant ideas

17:08.028 --> 17:11.195
And I'll explain in boring
detail why they can't work.

17:11.197 --> 17:14.932
Well, that sounds
a lot like my old job.

17:15.068 --> 17:17.134
(laughing)

17:18.171 --> 17:19.470
- Sir?

17:20.807 --> 17:22.473
I thought
professor harding took this

17:22.509 --> 17:23.541
Back to their
headquarters.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.810
It's not cormac's.
It's ours.

17:25.812 --> 17:28.079
- Ours? Why would we?

17:28.081 --> 17:29.380
- It's the future, isn't it?

17:29.515 --> 17:33.017
- Sir, they are
demonstrably not secure.

17:33.019 --> 17:35.453
- We have a passcode.
Come here. Come here!

17:37.123 --> 17:40.224
Keep it to yourself:
It's Wednesday.

17:41.094 --> 17:42.693
The team! Football.
Sheffield.

17:42.695 --> 17:45.096
- Ah, yes, yes, yes.
No one will ever guess that.

17:45.231 --> 17:48.299
- Look at this,
someone sent out a photo

17:48.368 --> 17:49.967
Of a cat hanging
from a clothesline.

17:50.036 --> 17:51.769
Bloody priceless!

17:51.904 --> 17:53.337
(laughs)

17:53.339 --> 17:55.640
- Sirs. I've spoken to
the parlour users

17:55.775 --> 17:56.874
Mr. Cormac spied on.

17:57.009 --> 17:59.510
They all have alibis except for
naked photograph man.

17:59.512 --> 18:00.711
He's in the interview room.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.080
Clothed, sir.

18:03.116 --> 18:04.648
- Oh, good. Good.

18:04.684 --> 18:07.051
Uh, henry, copy this to
my blackboard

18:07.186 --> 18:09.353
Exactly as it's written,
please.

18:09.389 --> 18:10.521
- Sir.

18:10.557 --> 18:12.756
(laughs)

18:14.327 --> 18:15.826
- Oh, yeah.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.399
- My goodness.

18:28.741 --> 18:29.874
This is your front door.

18:30.009 --> 18:32.209
- Yes. The images renew
every six seconds.

18:33.179 --> 18:34.444
- How about that?

18:36.683 --> 18:38.549
And what's all of this?

18:38.618 --> 18:40.885
- Each light represents a cell,

18:40.887 --> 18:43.354
Each blink
represents a transmission,

18:43.356 --> 18:46.424
987 machines transmitting

18:46.559 --> 18:49.126
To 40 cells
on three continents.

18:50.263 --> 18:52.130
- What about the costs
of overseas transmission?

18:52.265 --> 18:53.831
- We transmit in units
of seven bits,

18:53.900 --> 18:56.366
Which allows
for very high speed.

18:56.402 --> 18:58.101
- And who are your users?

18:58.138 --> 19:00.170
- Oh, volunteers, mostly.
Some random.

19:00.206 --> 19:02.039
Some specifically chosen.

19:02.041 --> 19:04.308
- Ah. Welcome mr. Crabtree.

19:04.310 --> 19:07.511
Look, I've told the front staff,
now I'm telling you.

19:07.514 --> 19:10.715
No contact with pendrick
or harding until further notice.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.584
- Is this about
the cormac murder?

19:14.521 --> 19:16.119
- That's none of your concern.

19:16.156 --> 19:17.654
You're not a copper anymore.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.292
(clears throat)

19:24.597 --> 19:26.063
- Where'd you get that?

19:26.132 --> 19:28.065
- You transmitted this?

19:28.101 --> 19:30.534
- I sent it to a lady friend.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.035
Is that why I'm here?

19:33.206 --> 19:35.405
- You're here because
you are under suspicion

19:35.441 --> 19:37.140
Of the murder
of vincent cormac.

19:38.077 --> 19:39.810
- I don't know
anything about that.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.681
- The data of this image
was found in his machine,

19:43.750 --> 19:45.749
We believe for
the purposes of extortion.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.551
- You believe what you want.

19:47.587 --> 19:48.753
I didn't kill him.

19:58.565 --> 19:59.763
(ogden): Margaret?

20:07.306 --> 20:08.438
Donna farrow?

20:08.474 --> 20:10.807
Margaret,
this is private information!

20:11.778 --> 20:13.577
- She knows
something about bobby.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.379
She said they found him.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.647
- Who found him?

20:16.683 --> 20:19.216
- I don't know!
But I need to find out.

20:23.056 --> 20:25.589
- It may be something you
don't want to hear, margaret.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.391
Are you prepared for that?

20:29.462 --> 20:31.061
- I have to know.

20:31.097 --> 20:32.330
I'm his mother.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.401
- Ah, sir.

20:37.536 --> 20:38.402
It's all done.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.004
- Very good.

20:40.073 --> 20:42.139
Now, there's a pattern
here somewhere.

20:42.175 --> 20:43.874
- If you say so, sir.

20:43.943 --> 20:46.010
- There's a symmetry
of sorts there.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.613
- And this one is almost
a palindrome

20:49.616 --> 20:52.450
Except for the a
and the n.

20:52.452 --> 20:54.151
(watts): Uh-huh.

20:54.287 --> 20:55.719
- A...

20:56.522 --> 20:57.854
N.

20:59.826 --> 21:04.361
A, dot, dash, n, dash, dot.

21:06.099 --> 21:10.301
- Uh... Each half is the mirror
of the other in morse code.

21:10.303 --> 21:12.069
- That's it!

21:12.138 --> 21:15.172
Henry, convert this entire
sequence to morse code.

21:15.308 --> 21:17.774
We need to make a visual
representation of this.

21:17.810 --> 21:18.909
We'll need a grid,

21:18.978 --> 21:23.380
Roughly 65 squares by 28.

21:23.416 --> 21:26.383
And in the fields, instead
of inserting dots and dashes,

21:26.419 --> 21:29.720
You will then colour the square
or leave it blank.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.388
(sighs)
- yes sir.

21:31.524 --> 21:32.723
- I'll get some paper.

21:34.093 --> 21:35.459
- Good luck.

21:36.862 --> 21:38.528
- Yes. Thank you.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.500
(beeping)

21:50.009 --> 21:51.241
(scoffs)

21:58.318 --> 21:59.850
(intriguing music)

22:04.624 --> 22:05.623
(beeping)

22:11.097 --> 22:12.363
(typing)

22:24.844 --> 22:26.043
- No.

22:27.380 --> 22:28.846
(typing)

22:45.664 --> 22:47.465
- A belated welcome,
mr. Crabtree.

22:47.600 --> 22:48.732
How are you settling in?

22:48.801 --> 22:50.134
- Very well, thank you.

22:51.003 --> 22:52.536
Is everything all right, sir?

22:52.671 --> 22:55.405
- I'm not a knight;
there are no sirs here.

22:57.076 --> 22:58.609
Call me james.

23:01.247 --> 23:02.879
Quickiepedia?

23:02.915 --> 23:04.615
- Yes. I'm thinking...

23:04.684 --> 23:07.284
A compendium
of all human knowledge

23:07.286 --> 23:10.020
Written and edited by parlour
users themselves.

23:11.424 --> 23:14.425
- The knowledge of experts,
available to all?

23:14.494 --> 23:15.693
- And quickly.

23:16.362 --> 23:17.527
- It's ingenious.

23:18.865 --> 23:20.797
You rekindle my faith,
mr. Crabtree.

23:23.836 --> 23:26.570
- Oh, sir!
Come and see this.

23:26.572 --> 23:28.572
I wrote out the morse code
as you asked.

23:29.776 --> 23:31.208
It looks like a smile.

23:33.712 --> 23:36.647
- Henry, bring in mr. Pendrick.

23:38.384 --> 23:39.783
- Sir.

23:39.852 --> 23:41.786
(dramatic music)

23:46.025 --> 23:49.326
At is the function
of the cheshire cat grin?

23:49.328 --> 23:51.795
- Figuratively, or literally?

23:52.598 --> 23:53.797
(clears throat)

23:53.833 --> 23:57.668
- Bits of information,
if sent in a specific sequence,

23:57.737 --> 23:59.403
Will do something.

23:59.538 --> 24:02.206
What does this sequence do?

24:02.208 --> 24:05.008
- Well, sent as code,
it could be an address,

24:05.044 --> 24:07.144
Or a set of machine
instructions.

24:07.279 --> 24:10.748
But a transmitted image is just
that: It has no coded value.

24:10.883 --> 24:14.018
- What if we were to send this
sequence as text?

24:14.153 --> 24:15.519
- Let's try it.

24:15.654 --> 24:17.420
We'll be needing that,
inspector.

24:17.457 --> 24:18.689
- Not right now, I'm afraid.

24:18.758 --> 24:21.558
I'm in negotiation
with a nigerian prince.

24:21.627 --> 24:22.693
- What?

24:22.695 --> 24:24.594
- Well, he's about to be
overthrown

24:24.630 --> 24:26.497
And he wants to hide
his fortune in canada.

24:26.566 --> 24:30.034
He's willing to pay me 5,000 $
as a consultancy fee.

24:30.036 --> 24:32.903
- The originating cell
is from niagara.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.437
- You mean nigeria.

24:35.208 --> 24:36.974
- N-no, niagara as in falls.

24:37.043 --> 24:38.909
It seems to be some sort
of confidence scheme.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.210
- Oh, bloody hell.

24:40.246 --> 24:42.012
Then, who is it then?
- Don't know.

24:42.147 --> 24:43.647
They're masking their identity.

24:44.650 --> 24:45.749
(clears throat)

24:46.385 --> 24:47.484
- Ah!

24:53.192 --> 24:54.157
- All right.

24:54.861 --> 24:56.326
First sequence.

24:56.362 --> 24:58.929
- Ah, six, five...

24:59.599 --> 25:01.432
Five, five...

25:01.567 --> 25:03.166
- And seven more fives.

25:03.202 --> 25:05.269
- Oh. Yes. And...
A nine.

25:05.271 --> 25:06.836
(beeping)

25:07.773 --> 25:08.672
- Uh, next.

25:08.674 --> 25:11.876
- Zed, ten fives and then three.

25:15.615 --> 25:17.348
We're in someone else's machine.

25:17.950 --> 25:18.982
- Whose?

25:20.018 --> 25:22.186
- A man by the name of
milton jarvis.

25:23.389 --> 25:26.122
But his last transmission was...
Two months ago.

25:26.659 --> 25:27.491
Wait a minute.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.360
Someone's trying to get in.

25:29.495 --> 25:31.362
- Milton jarvis?
- No.

25:31.364 --> 25:32.762
Someone else.

25:37.136 --> 25:39.603
Operator, give me
pendrick headquarters.

25:40.473 --> 25:43.841
Run a scan on cell 7, unit 23.

25:43.976 --> 25:45.442
I want to know
who's transmitting.

25:47.380 --> 25:48.579
We're conducting a trace.

25:48.714 --> 25:49.847
- Ah!
- Ah!

25:49.982 --> 25:50.915
- Yes, yes.

25:52.552 --> 25:54.918
- Thank you. Very good.
Keep a record.

25:56.188 --> 25:59.657
The originating cell came
from a man named sam waters.

26:00.793 --> 26:02.993
- Isn't that the naked man?
- Indeed, sir.

26:02.995 --> 26:05.128
We now have more than
just motive.

26:05.164 --> 26:08.732
We need to bring mr. Waters back
in and confiscate his machine.

26:11.203 --> 26:14.605
- Imagine you could type
"chicken soup recipe"

26:14.674 --> 26:18.642
And find different recipes
shared by various users.

26:20.012 --> 26:23.146
- That information would be
stored on individual machines.

26:23.182 --> 26:24.681
We don't have access.

26:24.750 --> 26:28.819
- Yes, but imagine every user
had a line to a pendrick machine

26:28.821 --> 26:30.554
Dedicated solely to storage.

26:30.623 --> 26:33.490
You send your chicken soup
recipe up the line, I send mine.

26:33.626 --> 26:37.828
We all upline our recipes
and there they are, stored,

26:37.830 --> 26:40.297
To be accessed by any user,
at any time.

26:41.334 --> 26:43.367
- We would need dedicated
connections;

26:43.436 --> 26:45.369
Dedicated addresses;

26:45.504 --> 26:48.572
An automated index to allow
for quicker searches.

26:48.641 --> 26:50.174
- So, it's possible?

26:50.309 --> 26:51.775
- It's possible.

26:53.212 --> 26:54.911
- Dedicated storage?

26:54.947 --> 26:56.714
- Magnetic wire is cheap.

26:56.849 --> 26:59.916
- Land is cheap.
Power is cheap.

26:59.986 --> 27:02.619
- I see huge upfront costs
without defined profits.

27:03.623 --> 27:04.555
- Well, yes, but surely
the benefit--

27:04.690 --> 27:05.822
- To whom?

27:06.325 --> 27:07.424
- Mankind.

27:09.428 --> 27:11.928
- That is exactly
the kind of dreamy thinking

27:11.964 --> 27:13.997
That will obliterate
my father's investment.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.699
Tell me how
this will make money.

27:16.836 --> 27:18.068
- Well, it will make
the parlour better.

27:18.070 --> 27:19.469
You'll sell more machines.

27:20.106 --> 27:21.138
- I don't see that.

27:22.708 --> 27:24.941
- Well, that's fine.
I'm sure james will.

27:25.478 --> 27:26.744
- James!

27:27.413 --> 27:28.478
Oh...

27:29.748 --> 27:32.615
Yes, I see. You've had the, um,
"we're a team" chat.

27:32.652 --> 27:34.451
Teams have hierarchy.

27:34.487 --> 27:37.421
James may be the owner,
but I am your boss.

27:37.556 --> 27:39.689
You'll address me as
mr. Trent.

27:40.426 --> 27:42.158
Oh, and, by the way, um,

27:42.194 --> 27:43.660
No eating at your desk.

27:43.795 --> 27:45.362
We have a lunchroom for that.

27:50.803 --> 27:52.836
- How did he know
I was eating at my desk?

27:53.773 --> 27:55.706
- Small men focus on
small things.

27:57.042 --> 27:59.776
His father bequeathed him
his interest in this company.

27:59.812 --> 28:02.979
Immediate profit
is all he cares about.

28:05.784 --> 28:07.050
(sighs)

28:10.656 --> 28:12.856
(intriguing music)

28:15.094 --> 28:19.363
- This was transmitted
at the moment of
mr. Cormac's death.

28:20.433 --> 28:23.533
It is a binary
representation of this.

28:23.569 --> 28:26.803
It also contains a sequence that
provides direct access

28:26.839 --> 28:29.005
To the machine of one
milton jarvis,

28:29.007 --> 28:32.709
Whom we have learned
is living abroad currently.

28:33.212 --> 28:34.544
- Binary...

28:34.580 --> 28:35.678
Representation?

28:35.715 --> 28:38.348
- Don't play me for a fool,
mr. Waters!

28:39.485 --> 28:41.084
You are deeply connected
to the murder of a man

28:41.153 --> 28:42.486
For whom you had motive
to kill.

28:42.621 --> 28:44.822
- I didn't have motive.
You've got it wrong.

28:45.825 --> 28:47.758
Cormac wasn't trying
to extort me.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.593
We were both trying to catch
the man who was extorting me.

28:52.965 --> 28:56.166
About a month ago, I received
a copy of the photograph I sent

28:56.301 --> 28:58.502
And a message asking
for 500 $

28:58.571 --> 29:00.570
Or else the photograph would be
made public.

29:01.707 --> 29:03.640
The next day,
I got a message from mr. Cormac.

29:03.776 --> 29:05.843
He'd been monitoring
my transmissions.

29:05.978 --> 29:07.877
He told me the man who was
extorting me

29:07.913 --> 29:09.579
Had access to our machines.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.282
We called him mr. X.

29:13.285 --> 29:15.251
Cormac wanted my help
to trap him.

29:15.287 --> 29:16.253
I agreed.

29:16.322 --> 29:18.021
That's why he was murdered.

29:19.191 --> 29:21.391
- You believe by this mr. X?

29:21.427 --> 29:24.127
- Cormac told me he was close
to discovering his identity.

29:25.397 --> 29:26.797
He'd found a way to track him.
He'd compiled evidence.

29:26.866 --> 29:29.600
But he needed to hide it where
mr. X wouldn't think to look.

29:30.669 --> 29:32.869
- In the machine of a man
living abroad.

29:34.473 --> 29:37.608
- And why the cheshire cat grin?

29:38.677 --> 29:40.611
- We needed a code mr. X
wouldn't guess.

29:42.014 --> 29:44.881
- And why transmit it during
mr. Pendrick's address

29:44.917 --> 29:46.482
To his investors?

29:47.086 --> 29:48.318
- I've no idea.

29:49.522 --> 29:51.488
He sent it to me in a chat space
a half hour earlier.

29:52.391 --> 29:54.057
- 2:34.

29:55.761 --> 29:58.394
His last transmission
was to you.

29:59.097 --> 30:01.798
(intriguing music)

30:05.538 --> 30:06.703
(beeping)

30:18.651 --> 30:20.950
- "could you be
the cheshire cat?

30:21.987 --> 30:25.322
Because it happens
that I've failed you.

30:26.925 --> 30:28.692
Curious?

30:35.267 --> 30:39.068
Meet me on the bench across
from pendrick hq."

30:42.107 --> 30:43.807
- Is it possible

30:43.942 --> 30:47.744
That vincent cormac was killed
at 2:34 p.M.,

30:48.914 --> 30:53.149
But his murder was transmitted
26 minutes later?

30:53.151 --> 30:54.618
- You think that's what
happened?

30:54.753 --> 30:57.887
- It would explain the gap on
the primary recorder.

30:58.557 --> 30:59.890
- Is it possible?

30:59.892 --> 31:02.159
- You have to edit
the recording directly;

31:02.294 --> 31:04.694
Transfer the content
to the other recorder;

31:04.730 --> 31:07.230
Find a way to align the text
and the image--

31:07.299 --> 31:08.298
- They're stored separately.

31:08.433 --> 31:10.500
- And then you'd have to
manually roll back

31:10.502 --> 31:12.836
The timing mechanism
on the secondary recorder.

31:12.905 --> 31:15.271
- You'd need physical access
to the machine.

31:16.141 --> 31:18.508
- How long would
all of that take?

31:19.612 --> 31:20.911
- 10 minutes?
- Ah...

31:21.614 --> 31:23.079
I could do it in five.

31:24.617 --> 31:26.516
- He was killed
26 minutes earlier?

31:26.585 --> 31:28.318
- I believe so, yes.

31:28.354 --> 31:30.721
- Why go to all the trouble
of making it appear

31:30.723 --> 31:32.923
That he was killed during
pendrick's demonstration?

31:32.925 --> 31:34.857
- I've been giving it
a great deal of thought

31:34.894 --> 31:37.260
And I can think of only
one reason.

31:37.263 --> 31:38.795
- He wanted an alibi.

31:38.864 --> 31:42.131
- What better alibi than to be
in the company of everyone

31:42.167 --> 31:45.469
Watching the murder being
committed with their own eyes?

31:45.471 --> 31:48.805
- That includes everyone that
was attending the investors'
demonstration.

31:48.874 --> 31:51.808
- It just so happens that
miss beasley's boarding house

31:51.844 --> 31:54.811
Is only two blocks away
from pendrick headquarters.

31:54.947 --> 31:56.480
It would have taken 10 minutes,

31:56.615 --> 32:00.684
Leaving 16 minutes
to get to the demonstration,
shake hands, be seen.

32:00.819 --> 32:02.218
- It's tight.

32:02.254 --> 32:05.155
- But it opens up a whole
new field of potential suspects.

32:07.826 --> 32:09.826
(indistinct chatter)

32:10.429 --> 32:12.795
(intense music)

32:20.706 --> 32:22.305
Professor harding
can attest to that.

32:22.374 --> 32:24.107
- Actually, I cannot.

32:24.109 --> 32:27.310
I was, uh, waylaid by matters
relating to babbage

32:27.346 --> 32:30.313
And I arrived
at the demonstration
just before 3:00.

32:30.349 --> 32:33.183
- Babbage? The inventor
of the analytical engine?

32:33.318 --> 32:34.384
- Yes.

32:34.420 --> 32:36.119
But, in this case,
it's the name of my dog.

32:36.121 --> 32:39.289
- Is babbage all right?
- Oh, she got lost again.

32:39.291 --> 32:40.958
She's getting old.
- Oh, dear.

32:42.361 --> 32:44.394
- So, you don't have an alibi?

32:44.529 --> 32:45.929
- No, I don't.

32:45.931 --> 32:48.531
I absolutely could have
killed mr. Cormac,

32:48.600 --> 32:51.634
Changed the recording
and made it to the investor
demonstration.

32:53.305 --> 32:57.273
But I would like to stress
that I didn't.

33:06.251 --> 33:08.084
- I've got nothing to tell you.

33:08.220 --> 33:09.886
- I know you know about my son.

33:10.022 --> 33:11.554
- It's my husband's business

33:11.590 --> 33:13.056
And he don't like me
talking about it.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.224
- You said they found bobby.

33:14.293 --> 33:15.726
- And I've already
said too much.

33:15.861 --> 33:17.561
- Please.
I'm his mother.

33:18.564 --> 33:20.497
I just want to know
if he's alive.

33:20.566 --> 33:21.398
Please.

33:21.467 --> 33:22.665
- He's alive.

33:23.602 --> 33:25.501
Least he was
when they found him.

33:25.537 --> 33:27.270
- Where? Where is he?

33:29.140 --> 33:30.240
Wh--

33:30.375 --> 33:31.708
(sighs)

33:39.184 --> 33:41.184
(soft music)

33:47.493 --> 33:49.492
(bell tolling in the distance)

34:01.740 --> 34:04.074
(intriguing music)

34:11.216 --> 34:12.415
- You're the cheshire cat.

34:13.485 --> 34:17.687
- Ha! I guess that makes you
the curious cat?

34:17.756 --> 34:19.089
- You left me waiting.

34:19.158 --> 34:20.357
- Well, you're here now.

34:20.492 --> 34:22.024
Have a seat.

34:22.061 --> 34:23.060
Let's talk.

34:26.932 --> 34:29.032
- What does the cheshire cat
smile mean?

34:31.236 --> 34:32.102
- Nothing.

34:32.237 --> 34:33.370
It was bait.

34:33.372 --> 34:34.437
- Bait?

34:34.440 --> 34:36.106
- A few months ago,

34:36.175 --> 34:39.876
I became aware of a lurker in
one of the face spaces.

34:39.912 --> 34:41.778
- A lurker?
- Trespasser;

34:41.913 --> 34:43.713
Uninvited participant.

34:43.715 --> 34:46.750
So, I conducted a scan
and caught him.

34:46.752 --> 34:49.586
He turned out to be
vincent cormac.

34:49.588 --> 34:50.987
- The murder victim.

34:50.989 --> 34:53.590
- But I soon learned
that cormac was himself

34:53.592 --> 34:56.860
Trying to discover the identity
of a man he called mr. X

34:56.929 --> 34:59.128
Who could break
into individual machines.

34:59.164 --> 35:01.531
- Why didn't you go
to mr. Pendrick with this?

35:01.567 --> 35:03.066
- Because...

35:04.336 --> 35:08.471
Mr. X had access to information
stored on machines

35:08.540 --> 35:10.573
That aren't connected
to the parlour.

35:12.111 --> 35:14.544
- So, he worked
for pendrick enterprises.

35:14.679 --> 35:18.614
- For all I know,
it could be pendrick himself.

35:20.586 --> 35:22.119
- So that's when I said,

35:22.254 --> 35:24.687
"miss struthers, you had to come
in and talk to detective--"

35:24.756 --> 35:26.022
- Yes, of course, of course.

35:26.024 --> 35:28.091
Well, thank you both
for coming in.

35:28.160 --> 35:30.360
George, if you could
please excuse us.

35:32.297 --> 35:33.830
- Oh, right. Yes.

35:33.899 --> 35:34.997
Yes, of course.

35:36.135 --> 35:38.434
- Miss struthers.
- Yes.

35:38.436 --> 35:41.971
- Please help me understand
this, uh, "bait" gambit.

35:43.342 --> 35:46.242
- I wasn't looking for the man
who would show up to meet me.

35:46.311 --> 35:49.312
I was looking for
the man showing up to see

35:49.348 --> 35:50.580
Who was showing up.

35:50.715 --> 35:52.282
- To meet you.

35:52.351 --> 35:55.451
Ah, but if the plan was
to trick the killer

35:55.487 --> 35:59.389
Into reacting to the symbol
of the crime he'd committed...

35:59.391 --> 36:01.725
- The symbol was just to get
his attention.

36:02.895 --> 36:06.696
It was this verse
that was meant to trap him.

36:10.002 --> 36:11.935
- "could you be the cheshire cat

36:12.004 --> 36:14.804
Because it happens that
I've found you."

36:16.008 --> 36:17.407
I don't understand.

36:17.476 --> 36:18.608
- Oh, you're not meant to.

36:18.644 --> 36:20.543
But mr. X would.

36:20.546 --> 36:21.678
- How so?

36:22.981 --> 36:26.115
- The first letters of each line
spell out the passcode

36:26.185 --> 36:28.952
He was using to break
into individual machines.

36:30.021 --> 36:32.756
- One universal passcode?

36:32.891 --> 36:34.991
- It works on every machine.

36:36.161 --> 36:38.094
- And how did you come to have
this passcode?

36:38.096 --> 36:40.230
- We tricked him
into transmitting it.

36:40.365 --> 36:43.032
That's why cormac sent
the image of the cheshire cat.

36:44.102 --> 36:45.769
- Well, that wasn't meant
for sam waters?

36:45.771 --> 36:49.439
- No. It was all a trick
to convince mr. X

36:49.441 --> 36:50.974
We were on to him.

36:50.976 --> 36:53.243
We knew he'd be reading
sam's machine.

36:53.245 --> 36:56.045
We knew he'd try the codes
cormac transmitted.

36:56.081 --> 36:59.382
- And when those codes
didn't grant him access to
the machines,

36:59.384 --> 37:02.252
He would be forced to use
his universal passcode.

37:02.387 --> 37:05.055
- Yes. I was doing a scan
the whole time.

37:05.190 --> 37:08.190
As soon as he transmitted
the passcode, we had it.

37:08.227 --> 37:11.995
- You then used this riddle
to force him to expose himself.

37:12.064 --> 37:13.330
- Yes.

37:13.465 --> 37:15.532
But he didn't take the bait.

37:15.534 --> 37:17.233
- The bait?

37:21.740 --> 37:23.740
Why this sequence?

37:23.742 --> 37:25.408
- Could be random.

37:25.543 --> 37:28.745
The odds against someone typing
in that exact sequence

37:28.814 --> 37:31.147
Would be a trillion to one.

37:31.183 --> 37:32.882
- A cipher, maybe, sir?

37:32.951 --> 37:34.350
- Perhaps.

37:34.419 --> 37:37.687
- Might be as simple as going
ahead or back a letter for each.

37:37.822 --> 37:42.892
So: B, a, b, b, a...

37:44.363 --> 37:46.363
G.
(whispers): A,b,c,d.

37:46.365 --> 37:48.431
E. Sir!

37:48.433 --> 37:49.598
Cabbage!

37:50.902 --> 37:52.101
(both): Babbage!

37:59.845 --> 38:00.777
- Very good.

38:00.912 --> 38:02.846
George-- oh, I'm sorry.

38:02.981 --> 38:05.181
Henry!
Bring in professor harding!

38:10.588 --> 38:11.987
This is your passcode?

38:12.024 --> 38:13.256
- Yes.

38:13.325 --> 38:15.592
How...
How did you...?

38:15.594 --> 38:17.660
- It acts as a universal key.

38:17.729 --> 38:21.263
It granted us access
to every machine we've tried.

38:21.300 --> 38:24.600
You designed it that way
so that you would have access

38:24.670 --> 38:27.203
To other machines
for the purposes of extortion.

38:27.272 --> 38:29.873
Mr. Cormac found out
and you killed him.

38:30.008 --> 38:32.608
You then delayed transmission
of the murder

38:32.644 --> 38:35.111
To provide yourself
with an alibi.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.283
- There's no override sequence.

38:40.352 --> 38:41.917
No, I tried that.

38:43.488 --> 38:45.221
The back flow sequence? No.

38:47.926 --> 38:49.759
It's in the machine itself.

38:49.795 --> 38:52.128
It's in every damned machine.

38:53.265 --> 38:55.031
- What do you say
to these charges, mr. Harding?

38:55.767 --> 38:58.234
- I did this. It was me!

38:58.303 --> 38:59.769
- Is that a confession?

38:59.838 --> 39:02.538
Mr. Harding!
Mr. Harding, stop!

39:04.409 --> 39:05.674
Mr. Harding!

39:06.678 --> 39:08.077
(panting)
- professor, what are you doing?

39:08.080 --> 39:09.112
- Oi!

39:09.181 --> 39:11.113
- 10 years ago
I discovered a man

39:11.149 --> 39:13.115
By the name of karl schreyer
using my computer,

39:13.151 --> 39:15.651
So I installed a passcode into
the machine itself.

39:15.721 --> 39:17.587
But when we moved
to the new interface,

39:17.589 --> 39:20.523
Passcodes became electrical
and I forgot all about it.

39:20.658 --> 39:22.392
I-it was--
- a backdoor.

39:22.527 --> 39:24.728
To every machine we ever built.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.863
That's how he was able
to get in.

39:26.865 --> 39:28.064
Mr. X?

39:28.066 --> 39:29.532
- Who?

39:29.534 --> 39:32.735
- How did he get your passcode?

39:32.738 --> 39:36.339
- Sir, I think I know how.

39:36.474 --> 39:38.675
I think he observed
mr. Harding entering it

39:38.810 --> 39:40.276
Into his own machine.

39:40.278 --> 39:43.412
There's a photosensor
in the ceiling above my desk,

39:43.448 --> 39:45.481
Which used to be
professor harding's desk.

39:45.517 --> 39:46.749
- Photosensor?

39:46.818 --> 39:49.819
- A camera capable
of transmitting images
in real time.

39:49.855 --> 39:51.353
- To whom?

39:51.390 --> 39:53.589
- Garth trent.
He used it to spy on me.

39:54.726 --> 39:56.893
In fact, that's why
he didn't take the bait

39:56.895 --> 39:58.094
For miss struthers' trap.

39:58.096 --> 39:59.362
He was watching me
through the camera.

40:00.832 --> 40:03.633
- Mr. Trent was a participant at
your presentation, was he not?

40:03.768 --> 40:05.267
- He suggested it.

40:05.303 --> 40:07.103
- Thinking it would give him
the perfect alibi.

40:07.172 --> 40:08.037
- Hold it.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.307
Trent was transmitting
from parkdale.

40:11.309 --> 40:12.776
He couldn't have killed cormac

40:12.911 --> 40:14.244
And made it to the face space.

40:14.379 --> 40:16.045
- What if he wasn't?

40:17.048 --> 40:18.781
What if he wasn't
in parkdale at all?

40:18.817 --> 40:21.584
What if he was in mr. Cormac's
room the whole time?

40:21.586 --> 40:24.187
- I suppose he could have
relayed the face space
transmission

40:24.256 --> 40:25.321
From cormac's machine.

40:25.457 --> 40:27.657
- Well, let's bring up
his face space transmission.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.562
(intriguing music)

40:37.202 --> 40:38.267
- George.

40:40.605 --> 40:41.938
- Blackboard.

40:50.581 --> 40:52.414
- He never left cormac's room.

40:53.251 --> 40:55.351
- Right.
Let's arrest the bugger.

41:00.425 --> 41:02.292
(sombre music)

41:03.428 --> 41:05.895
- A confession could spare
you the noose.

41:08.700 --> 41:09.632
- What do you want to know?

41:09.701 --> 41:12.435
- How did you know
professor harding's passcode

41:12.570 --> 41:13.970
Was universal?

41:13.972 --> 41:15.572
- I didn't.

41:15.707 --> 41:17.840
I only meant to break into
harding's machine.

41:17.843 --> 41:20.243
- So you obtained his passcode.

41:20.245 --> 41:21.478
- And when I did,

41:22.681 --> 41:24.313
I found that I'd broken into
the wrong machine.

41:24.349 --> 41:26.649
- But the passcode still worked.

41:26.784 --> 41:29.185
- It worked on every machine
that I tried.

41:30.455 --> 41:31.520
(sighs)

41:32.491 --> 41:35.725
- Why, mr. Trent?
You had everything.

41:35.727 --> 41:37.793
You had a stake in the company.

41:37.829 --> 41:40.863
- My father squandered
my inheritance

41:40.866 --> 41:43.066
Building a thousand
pendrick portals.

41:43.068 --> 41:45.401
- Did you no longer
believe in the venture?

41:45.403 --> 41:46.702
- I never did!

41:47.739 --> 41:50.139
Pendrick has no head
for profits.

41:50.208 --> 41:53.075
All that he cares about
is progress.

41:54.679 --> 41:56.079
- So you found another way.

41:56.214 --> 41:59.749
- I had access to every secret.
I could have made millions.

42:00.886 --> 42:02.818
I-I got impatient.
I...

42:03.488 --> 42:04.754
I wanted to test it.

42:05.891 --> 42:07.757
- And in so doing
you attracted the attention

42:07.826 --> 42:10.293
Of the one person
who could track you down.

42:10.428 --> 42:12.227
- It was him or me.

42:14.966 --> 42:16.566
(crabtree):
You're folding the company?

42:18.003 --> 42:20.036
- I envisioned a better world,
mr. Crabtree.

42:21.306 --> 42:23.238
I built a tool that was meant
to bring us together.

42:24.509 --> 42:26.776
Instead, it was usurped
by criminals and charlatans.

42:28.380 --> 42:30.713
I keep making the mistake
of thinking people are better
than they are.

42:30.715 --> 42:33.316
- Well, I'm truly sorry,
mr. Pendrick.

42:33.318 --> 42:34.583
- I'm sorry, too.

42:34.619 --> 42:37.052
And I made you quit your job
and now I've dashed your dreams.

42:37.088 --> 42:39.989
- Oh, not at all. As much as
I appreciated the opportunity,

42:39.991 --> 42:42.992
Turns out,
I'm a copper after all.

42:43.061 --> 42:44.259
- Hm.

42:48.266 --> 42:49.932
(gentle music)

42:51.403 --> 42:53.302
(city hubbub)

42:57.208 --> 42:59.141
- Sorry it didn't work out,
crabtree.

42:59.177 --> 43:00.343
- Sir.

43:00.412 --> 43:03.546
I don't suppose my old job
is still available?

43:03.681 --> 43:05.447
- The thing is, bugalugs,

43:05.483 --> 43:08.183
We've already promoted baker up
to constable second class.

43:09.054 --> 43:10.420
- Ah.

43:10.422 --> 43:13.722
- But, luckily, we have
an opening for constable
first class.

43:13.758 --> 43:15.291
It pays less than pendrick,

43:15.426 --> 43:17.493
But it's a good bump up on what
you were making before.

43:17.629 --> 43:20.396
- We've also inquired
with the chief constable.

43:20.531 --> 43:24.600
If I and the inspector draft
letters of recommendation,

43:24.636 --> 43:26.069
They will waive the prohibition.

43:26.204 --> 43:29.071
- You won't make detective
this year or even next year.

43:29.140 --> 43:31.540
But the door will no longer
be closed to you.

43:34.012 --> 43:35.445
- Welcome back, george.

43:35.580 --> 43:37.179
- Good to be back, sirs.

43:37.982 --> 43:39.181
(chuckles)

43:41.419 --> 43:43.786
(intriguing music)

44:07.712 --> 44:08.944
Subtitling: Difuze
