00:15.834 --> 00:17.959
Can't sleep?

00:20.834 --> 00:22.959
No, me neither.

00:23.792 --> 00:26.834
Must be all the excitement.

00:27.542 --> 00:29.625
All these people.

00:33.375 --> 00:35.083
Here...

00:40.875 --> 00:43.041
Is that better?

00:46.542 --> 00:48.625
I'll leave you now.

00:49.333 --> 00:50.917
But know one thing.

00:52.542 --> 00:55.125
If you ever tell your mother...

00:55.875 --> 00:59.125
or anyone else, about today...

00:59.875 --> 01:04.083
..I will snap you in two.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.875
Hello,
and welcome to Telethon Tuneup.

02:50.959 --> 02:52.125
Now there's lots to tell you
about in the program.

02:52.208 --> 02:54.083
But right now
I'm waiting for a bus.

02:54.166 --> 02:56.917
In fact, this is the bus now.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.375
I suppose it looks a fairly
ordinary kind of bus to you,

02:59.458 --> 03:03.083
but believe you me,
this bus is pretty special,

03:03.166 --> 03:07.250
because inside it's got fun
and sun - for Telefun.

03:07.333 --> 03:08.834
Not bad, eh? Here we go.

03:09.625 --> 03:12.917
Hello. One ticket, please,
to the Telefun spots

03:13.000 --> 03:14.750
of Yorkshire-by-the-Sea.
Thank you.

03:14.834 --> 03:17.291
Aha, a bargain.

♪ heavy rock music ♪

03:49.125 --> 03:51.458
♪ choral music ♪

04:01.583 --> 04:04.250
Madam.

04:16.250 --> 04:19.667
Bridget, darling, what's this in
Dempster this morning?

04:19.750 --> 04:21.000
"200 guests, 10,000 acres,

04:21.083 --> 04:23.000
party of the year."

04:23.083 --> 04:24.709
Sounds like we're made of money!

04:24.792 --> 04:26.417
I told you
not to talk to the press!

04:26.500 --> 04:27.834
I didn't talk to the press!

04:27.917 --> 04:29.500
"'I'm just having
a few friends over

04:29.583 --> 04:32.959
to celebrate my husband's
birthday,' says Lady Gravesend.

04:33.041 --> 04:34.750
Guests include
Princess Margaret."

04:34.834 --> 04:36.333
Frankly,
I wish I hadn't bothered.

04:36.417 --> 04:39.041
It's so gray out there!
If it was May or June,

04:39.125 --> 04:40.208
we could be out on the big lawn,
but November--

04:40.291 --> 04:42.625
One can't help when one's born.

04:42.709 --> 04:45.250
No. It's extremely aggravating.

04:46.083 --> 04:48.500
I've asked Tony to come
early to help brighten it up.

04:48.583 --> 04:50.917
God. That appalling man
shouldn't be coming at all.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.959
Jumped-up painter
and decorator.

04:53.750 --> 04:56.208
Just keep him away from Princess
Margaret. Little popinjay!

04:56.291 --> 04:59.667
What is a popinjay, I wonder?

04:59.750 --> 05:01.709
Darling,
haven't you forgotten something?

05:03.000 --> 05:04.917
- Happy birthday!

05:14.125 --> 05:16.834
Yes, hello?

05:17.959 --> 05:20.542
Now, why
haven't you replied to Bridget?

05:20.625 --> 05:22.750
You simply must come.
Open the door!

05:24.125 --> 05:26.458
Do you have any idea
how difficult it was

05:26.542 --> 05:28.542
to get you invited
in the first place?

05:28.625 --> 05:30.375
I'm very grateful,
but I don't think I'm ready

05:30.458 --> 05:32.041
for the world just yet.

05:32.125 --> 05:34.500
Why are these curtains drawn?

05:34.583 --> 05:36.291
There.

05:36.375 --> 05:40.750
Better than a psychiatric ward,
I suppose.

05:40.834 --> 05:42.542
Theoretically.
I need a drink.

05:42.625 --> 05:44.166
Do you have a drink,
a proper drink?

05:44.250 --> 05:47.208
No, that's one of the reasons
I was on the psychiatric ward.

05:47.291 --> 05:50.250
- I can offer you herbal teas.
- Don't be absurd.

05:50.333 --> 05:53.083
You know, you might
at least open a window,

05:53.166 --> 05:55.834
or take a step outside
once in a while.

05:55.917 --> 05:58.709
And your mother, she's
almost as reclusive as you are.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.000
Amazing, isn't it?

06:00.083 --> 06:01.750
She thinks there might be more
to life than going to parties.

06:01.834 --> 06:05.583
Yes, I always thought
she was a little peculiar.

06:05.667 --> 06:06.834
- As far as I'm aware

06:06.917 --> 06:10.417
she's driving a consignment
of 10,000 syringes to Poland.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.208
Everyone says
it's marvelous of her,

06:12.291 --> 06:15.083
but I still think charity
begins at home.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.125
I wish she'd bring them
round here.

06:17.208 --> 06:20.875
I thought you'd er...
put all that behind you.

06:20.959 --> 06:23.291
Behind me, in front of me.

06:23.375 --> 06:25.709
You're very melodramatic today.

06:25.792 --> 06:27.542
Yes, well, I've realized
I've given up everything

06:27.625 --> 06:30.083
- and taken up nothing.
- You've taken up the law.

06:30.166 --> 06:31.542
You're going to
"work for a living".

06:31.625 --> 06:32.834
Yes, that's the intention.

06:32.917 --> 06:34.959
In fact, it's a necessity now
with the medical bills.

06:35.041 --> 06:37.500
- But I still feel as if life--
- That's enough. Sit down.

06:39.250 --> 06:40.709
- Sit down.

06:44.083 --> 06:48.125
Offended as I am by
the very idea of a "pep talk",

06:48.208 --> 06:49.250
I'm left with no choice.

06:49.333 --> 06:52.125
You can't rot in this hovel.

06:52.208 --> 06:54.500
Quite apart
from how depressing it is,

06:54.583 --> 06:56.792
I owe it to your dear papa
to get you back

06:56.875 --> 06:58.417
- into the swim of things.
- But the fear is, Nicholas,

06:58.500 --> 07:01.834
- that I might drown.
- Nonsense.

07:01.917 --> 07:04.291
Pull yourself together,
find something to wear,

07:04.375 --> 07:07.667
and if you must talk about life,
you can do so at the party.

07:07.750 --> 07:08.917
I'm sure someone
will listen to you.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.166
And remember, it's a party:
you're not meant to enjoy it.

07:26.959 --> 07:29.792
Oh, God.

07:31.709 --> 07:33.875
I know what you're thinking,
not enough color.

07:33.959 --> 07:35.667
That's why
I've bought you these.

07:35.750 --> 07:38.667
I thought tents, I thought
poles, I thought ribbons,

07:38.750 --> 07:41.875
- I thought maypoles.
- They look like er...

07:41.959 --> 07:44.750
Sonny's regimental tie.
I had them specially made.

07:44.834 --> 07:48.208
- Oh, 20 and the dreaded.

07:48.291 --> 07:50.291
I see.
What's the dreaded?

07:50.375 --> 07:53.291
- V.A.T.
- Goodness.

07:53.375 --> 07:55.959
You are a naughty, naughty girl!

07:56.041 --> 07:57.792
- Oh, dear.
- Running out here without--

07:57.875 --> 08:00.875
I do wish Nanny wasn't
quite so horrid to Belinda.

08:00.959 --> 08:02.208
Why don't you just sack
the old hag?

08:02.291 --> 08:04.375
She's terrifying.

08:04.458 --> 08:07.834
Tony, just...make it better,
will you?

08:07.917 --> 08:10.875
Darling.

08:12.041 --> 08:14.083
Where did you get this?

08:14.834 --> 08:16.959
Tell me! Where?

08:17.709 --> 08:18.917
- Nanny,

08:19.000 --> 08:20.333
I'm sure she didn't steal it.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.583
One of the security men
will have lost it.

08:22.667 --> 08:24.625
Here -
I'll find out who it belongs to.

08:24.709 --> 08:26.083
Mummy, will you come and play?

08:26.166 --> 08:28.166
Your mummy's much too busy
to play with the likes of you!

08:28.250 --> 08:31.208
Maybe later, darling.

08:38.166 --> 08:40.792
Hello?
Hello, can you hear me?

08:43.125 --> 08:44.250
Hello,
I've got your walkie-talkie.

08:47.834 --> 08:51.417
Of course I'll tell her.
But it can hardly be tonight

08:51.500 --> 08:52.750
after all the trouble
she's gone to.

08:52.834 --> 08:56.000
But all this
skulking around and lying.

08:56.083 --> 08:59.583
- And at your party too.
- I know, I know, I know.

08:59.667 --> 09:00.917
But let's not think
about that now, my love.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.417
The important thing is
I get to see you in the flesh,

09:04.667 --> 09:06.709
even if it's just a glimpse.

09:17.417 --> 09:19.291
Who is that, d'you think?

09:26.709 --> 09:28.291
- Not this second.

09:28.375 --> 09:30.792
Bridget's party tonight, I need
you to come as my guest.

09:30.875 --> 09:33.333
- It's Patrick! Go and answer!
- Debbie's going to be there.

09:33.417 --> 09:35.959
Debbie - who I need to
apologize to but I can't,

09:36.041 --> 09:37.041
not without taking drugs,

09:37.125 --> 09:38.959
which is the very thing
I need to apologize for.

09:39.041 --> 09:41.625
And Julia - Julia will be there
and her bloody husband.

09:41.709 --> 09:44.792
- Oh, hello, you are there.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.792
Look, what do you think?
Should I go?

09:46.875 --> 09:48.208
If you think you're up to it.

09:48.291 --> 09:50.834
No, of course I'm not, but
Nicholas Pratt's been round here

09:50.917 --> 09:52.083
practically marching me
out of the door

09:52.166 --> 09:54.083
saying I need to get
back in the swing of things.

09:54.166 --> 09:55.917
Is he coming?
Tell him he has to come!

09:56.000 --> 09:57.333
Sorry, are you with someone?

09:57.417 --> 09:58.875
I hate to agree with Nicholas
Pratt, but perhaps he's right.

09:58.959 --> 10:02.375
Well, look, can you help me?
Can you come

10:02.458 --> 10:04.709
Yeah, of course, but I have
to go to my meeting first.

10:04.792 --> 10:07.000
What meeting?
Oh, that meeting.

10:07.083 --> 10:08.750
I don't know how you
put up with those things.

10:08.834 --> 10:10.750
Isn't it full of
the most ghastly people?

10:10.834 --> 10:12.667
- Yes!

10:12.917 --> 10:16.333
Yes, which is exactly why I
mustn't go to this bloody party!

10:16.417 --> 10:19.333
It's three o'clock.
I'll see you there.

10:19.417 --> 10:20.917
It's open to everyone,
by the way.

10:24.417 --> 10:27.166
Patrick Melrose.
He'll be fun.

10:27.542 --> 10:29.000
Have you told him about us?

10:29.667 --> 10:32.166
No, you told me not to.
Have you?

10:32.583 --> 10:35.542
I haven't seen Patrick
for years.

10:36.458 --> 10:38.417
What did he say about me?

10:38.500 --> 10:43.750
He said...he's very much looking
forward to meeting your husband.

10:45.625 --> 10:50.041
- So am I.
- Christ, I hate parties.

12:18.959 --> 12:20.625
And on a busy day like this.

What are we reading?
This one.

12:21.709 --> 12:23.583
But you've already read this.

Both parents in one day!
We are honored.

12:38.250 --> 12:39.709
We haven't time for this.
I need you to speak to security.

12:39.792 --> 12:41.834
The Princess will be here soon.

My name's Harry.
If we can all start, please,

13:35.625 --> 13:37.917
with a moment of silence.

13:45.583 --> 13:48.542
I should really begin
with the childhood stuff.

13:49.792 --> 13:52.417
I mean, that's when
it all starts, isn't it?

13:53.417 --> 13:56.083
But I don't want to go into
all that so, fast-forward:

13:56.166 --> 14:00.333
I'm 16 years old
and I go on this school trip.

14:01.417 --> 14:04.375
I can't actually remember where
it was - Belgium or France...

14:16.542 --> 14:19.291
..but when I was using, I
found it easy to cross the road

14:19.375 --> 14:23.333
because I genuinely didn't care
if I was run over or not.

14:23.417 --> 14:26.458
But now I'm in recovery
I'm fucking terrified.

14:27.166 --> 14:29.542
I walk for miles
for a zebra crossing.

14:32.291 --> 14:34.250
Just this morning I found myself

14:34.333 --> 14:37.041
chopping out lines of
Colman's Mustard Powder.

14:37.750 --> 14:40.125
Little neat lines.

14:40.208 --> 14:42.041
I make tea,
and I find myself worrying

14:42.125 --> 14:44.375
that I've put too much
sugar on the spoon.

14:45.250 --> 14:48.792
I watch TV and I start
to think I'm controlling it.

14:48.875 --> 14:50.792
I couldn't watch last night
'cause I was worried about

14:50.875 --> 14:52.667
putting the weatherman off
by staring at him.

14:52.750 --> 14:54.792
So...

14:54.875 --> 14:57.709
Sometimes I think,
"Fuck it, what's the point?

14:57.792 --> 15:02.125
Just...start...using again,

15:02.208 --> 15:04.125
What's to stop you?"

15:05.375 --> 15:09.208
Is...saying this out loud
meant to help somehow?

15:09.291 --> 15:11.709
Am I meant to feel better now?

15:14.709 --> 15:18.333
Anyway.

15:19.458 --> 15:22.792
- Thanks.
Thanks, Peter.

15:22.875 --> 15:26.083
So, anybody else?
Anyone who hasn't spoken yet?

15:29.750 --> 15:31.542
Yeah. Hi. I'm Johnny.
I'm an addict.

15:31.625 --> 15:33.625
Hi, Johnny!

15:33.709 --> 15:36.208
I'm going to a party tonight
with a good friend,

15:36.291 --> 15:38.166
also in recovery, not in NA.

15:38.834 --> 15:42.583
And I know there'll be lots of
drugs around, alcohol too...

15:42.667 --> 15:45.166
I'm going too!

15:45.250 --> 15:47.375
- Hi, Johnny!
- Hi.

15:47.959 --> 15:50.667
Anyway, it's a big party

15:50.750 --> 15:53.667
and I just feel...

15:53.750 --> 15:56.875
..under threat, I suppose.

15:57.875 --> 16:02.500
And I wanted to reaffirm
my desire to stay clean today,

16:02.583 --> 16:05.500
and hopefully keep
my friend clean too.

16:08.291 --> 16:10.166
Okay. Thanks.

16:10.250 --> 16:12.291
Thanks, Johnny.
Thanks, Johnny.

16:13.166 --> 16:15.917
Now before we finish,
it's newcomer time.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.500
Newcomers only, please.
Anyone?

16:20.542 --> 16:22.542
Anyone?

16:22.625 --> 16:25.667
Okay, if you could all
join me in the Serenity Prayer.

16:28.208 --> 16:31.417
God, give me grace
to accept with serenity

16:31.500 --> 16:34.166
the things
that cannot be changed.

that Patrick Melrose is coming?

it's good for people like us

- And here he is!

17:12.834 --> 17:15.375
- Hello, Patrick!
- Amanda.

17:15.458 --> 17:17.166
Nice to see you out and about.

17:17.750 --> 17:20.417
Amanda was just wondering
if you were coming to the party.

17:20.500 --> 17:23.417
- You know, I think I may.
- Great!

17:23.500 --> 17:25.291
I'll see you there!

17:25.375 --> 17:27.208
Might need you
for an emergency meeting.

I'll feel safer
knowing you're there.

17:28.917 --> 17:31.542
Okay. Bye. Patrick.

17:33.500 --> 17:37.542
She's not an addict, she just
likes a bit of coke. Amateur!

17:39.917 --> 17:41.792
Honestly, I don't know
how you stand it.

17:41.875 --> 17:44.250
The slogans,
the fatuous jargon--

17:44.333 --> 17:46.208
That's not a reason
to hope they fail.

17:46.291 --> 17:47.417
I don't hope they fail.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.625
I just don't know how anybody
can bear the hypocrisy.

17:49.709 --> 17:52.291
They have a slogan for that too.
"Fake it to make it."

17:52.375 --> 17:53.750
Christ,
it's worse than I thought.

17:53.834 --> 17:55.417
- It's just a place to confess.
- Fine.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.709
If you confess to things that
matter and people never do.

17:57.792 --> 17:59.834
Even so, if it helps to say
these things out loud--

17:59.917 --> 18:03.250
- But it's just so unnecessary!

18:03.333 --> 18:05.500
Don't you find it hard
not to take drugs?

18:05.583 --> 18:08.458
Of course. It's a fucking
nightmare, being lucid.

18:08.542 --> 18:12.417
My inner-life, Johnny, is an
endless reel of decapitations

18:12.500 --> 18:13.917
and dogs fighting over the liver

18:14.000 --> 18:16.250
that I'd quite like back,
thank you very much.

18:16.333 --> 18:18.834
Oblivion would be wonderful,

18:18.917 --> 18:21.333
if I didn't have this horror
of forgetting.

18:21.417 --> 18:24.667
- Don't try and make me share.

18:24.750 --> 18:28.959
Don't try to recruit me
to your little cult.

18:31.417 --> 18:33.667
There are things I haven't
told anybody, and never will.

18:33.750 --> 18:36.458
Including you.

18:36.542 --> 18:38.458
Well, fine, then.
I won't ask.

18:39.333 --> 18:42.458
I'd just like some Earl Grey
tea. Thank you very much!

18:44.333 --> 18:46.667
Mummy!
Look what Granny got me!

18:46.750 --> 18:48.041
- You mustn't give her sweets.

18:48.125 --> 18:50.250
They're very bad for her teeth.

18:50.333 --> 18:53.417
Nanny disapproves terribly.
Don't you, Nanny?

18:53.500 --> 18:55.542
Yes, I do.
What are we talking about?

18:55.625 --> 18:58.834
No! Absolutely
no sweeties in the nursery!

19:00.792 --> 19:03.375
I'm not in the nursery anymore!

19:03.458 --> 19:04.917
And now she's over-excited!

19:07.458 --> 19:09.583
Perhaps she could just have
one or two after dinner.

19:09.667 --> 19:11.000
Ah, yes, now, the dinner.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.542
Erm...I meant to tell you,

19:13.625 --> 19:15.542
you're going out for supper
with our neighbors,

19:15.625 --> 19:17.375
- the Bossington-Lanes.
- Oh.

19:17.458 --> 19:18.834
It's just gonna be so stuffy

19:18.917 --> 19:20.667
and formal here
with Princess Margaret.

19:20.750 --> 19:22.709
Oh, you don't mind, do you?

19:22.792 --> 19:24.208
We just thought it'd be nicer,

19:24.291 --> 19:26.625
more relaxed,
round their dinner table.

19:26.709 --> 19:29.458
And then you can join us later
for the big party,

19:29.542 --> 19:33.417
- you know, the exciting bit.
- No, no, that sounds very nice.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.875
Erm... Will you excuse me?
I must just--

19:37.792 --> 19:40.625
- You deserve an Oscar.

19:40.709 --> 19:42.792
- I'm thinking of her too!
- Of course.

19:44.667 --> 19:46.041
Is Granny upset?

19:46.291 --> 19:47.041
What on earth
makes you say that?

19:47.125 --> 19:49.583
She looked sad when she left.

19:49.667 --> 19:53.500
That's just the way
her face looks when it relaxes.

19:53.583 --> 19:55.500
Well, must get on.

Yes. Nowadays when I go

You don't take drugs anymore."

24:44.250 --> 24:47.750

the non-addictive high.

Call me old-fashioned, but I
don't really see the attraction

25:37.709 --> 25:40.458

25:41.333 --> 25:43.166
Of course
I love the countryside,

25:43.250 --> 25:45.709
but I do wish
everything would stay still.

25:45.792 --> 25:47.333
I'm so aesthetic.
I want to arrange the cows

25:47.417 --> 25:50.125

26:00.542 --> 26:03.917
- Next to the French Ambassador.

26:06.709 --> 26:09.959
I think it was
Marcel Proust who said

26:10.041 --> 26:11.125
that the number
of guests at a dinner

26:11.208 --> 26:15.250
should be more than the Graces,
but less than the Muses.

26:15.333 --> 26:17.333
But this is absolutely
extraordinary.

26:17.417 --> 26:19.834
I don't know what
you're talking about.

26:19.917 --> 26:21.959
Shall we get started?

26:31.375 --> 26:33.667
Fuck.

26:43.333 --> 26:46.750
My lady-in-waiting turned to
to the taxi driver and said,

26:46.834 --> 26:49.000
"Take us to
the Royal Garden Hotel."

26:49.083 --> 26:51.166
Which, as you know, is
at the bottom of the drive.

26:51.250 --> 26:54.000
And the taxi driver
nodded at me and said,

26:54.083 --> 26:56.333
"I know where she lives!"

26:56.417 --> 26:59.667
What a wonderful story!

26:59.750 --> 27:02.458
What wonderful people!
Salt of the earth.

27:02.542 --> 27:03.875
One does like to travel...

27:06.041 --> 27:08.000
- I saw you earlier.

27:08.083 --> 27:10.875
In reception.
We're staying at the same hotel.

27:10.959 --> 27:13.875
Ah! Home of the famous
Cotswold Carvery.

27:13.959 --> 27:17.041
"Book early
to avoid disappointment."

27:17.125 --> 27:19.917
Yes, if only I'd known
it was so easy.

27:22.125 --> 27:24.208
Would you rather be there
than here?

27:24.291 --> 27:27.208
Almost anywhere.

27:27.291 --> 27:31.208
Except if I wasn't here, this is
the only place I'd want to be.

27:31.291 --> 27:34.333
So...how do you manage?

27:40.166 --> 27:42.333
It's impossible.

27:42.417 --> 27:44.917
Salvation crumbles
the moment you touch it.

27:46.083 --> 27:47.959
I mean,
look at all these people -

27:48.041 --> 27:50.417
snobs, social climbers,

27:50.500 --> 27:52.625
museum pieces.

27:54.375 --> 27:56.959
I must say, I'm not sure
why I'm here either.

27:57.041 --> 28:00.875
I think Bridget likes the family
to know she's arrived.

28:00.959 --> 28:02.959
I'm sure.
But arrived where?

28:06.500 --> 28:09.208
What is this

28:09.291 --> 28:12.041
It's hard to tell
in this murky sauce.

28:12.125 --> 28:14.500
Yes, it is venison. I'm
awfully sorry about the sauce.

28:14.583 --> 28:16.417
- It's perfectly disgusting.

28:16.500 --> 28:20.458
Do you like it? It's venison.

28:20.542 --> 28:23.125
Really, it is something
absolutely marvelous.

28:23.208 --> 28:26.250
And the sauce, it's so subtle.

28:26.333 --> 28:29.250
I didn't know one could find
such cooking in this country...

28:29.750 --> 28:33.125
Ma'am. Oh, Ma'am.

28:33.208 --> 28:35.583
- I'm sorry. The sauce.
- Wipe.

28:37.250 --> 28:40.500
- I said wipe.

28:45.542 --> 28:47.000
Yes. Sure.

28:47.375 --> 28:49.500
Excuse me.

28:53.667 --> 28:56.083
I thought I couldn't dislike
the sauce more

28:56.166 --> 28:57.625
when it was on my plate.

28:57.709 --> 29:01.041
The sauce has been a disaster,
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

29:01.125 --> 29:03.291
There's no need for you
to apologize.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.500
- Look, another one.
- Jacques--

29:05.583 --> 29:08.166
Jacqueline, I have done
something unpardonable.

29:08.250 --> 29:10.333
Ma'am, let me help you.

29:10.417 --> 29:12.834
No. He spilt it.
He should wipe it up!

29:12.917 --> 29:14.333
- Yes.
- In fact, one feels

29:14.417 --> 29:15.542
he could have had a great career

29:15.625 --> 29:18.166
in dry-cleaning if he hadn't
been blown off course.

29:18.250 --> 29:20.417

29:25.750 --> 29:28.041
What is "insupportable"
is being showered

29:28.125 --> 29:29.667
with this revolting sauce!

29:29.750 --> 29:32.375
I needn't remind you
that your husband

29:32.458 --> 29:34.083
is Ambassador
to the Court of St. James!

30:00.625 --> 30:03.500
Silence.
I don't approve of silences!

30:05.166 --> 30:09.291
I get fallow deer sent to me
from Richmond Park.

30:09.375 --> 30:10.500
You have to be on the list.

30:10.583 --> 30:14.500
The Queen said to me, "Put
yourself on the list." So I did.

30:14.583 --> 30:16.417
How very sensible,
Ma'am.

30:16.500 --> 30:18.792
What I admire about
Princess Margaret

30:18.875 --> 30:21.583
is the way she puts
everyone at their ease.

30:23.041 --> 30:25.041
Are you alright?

30:29.166 --> 30:30.542
Putain de merde!

30:39.583 --> 30:41.166
Hello, little girl.

30:42.750 --> 30:44.917
Who are you?

30:45.500 --> 30:46.583
I'm Belinda.

30:46.667 --> 30:49.667
Is Princess Margaret in there?

30:50.750 --> 30:53.125
Remind me, Sonny,
do you have any children?

30:53.208 --> 30:55.625
Yes, indeed, Ma'am.
A daughter, seven years old.

30:56.500 --> 30:59.208
No male heir, then?

30:59.291 --> 31:01.917
Even so, I'm very fond of her.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.291
Of course, in many ways
I feel responsible.

31:04.375 --> 31:06.375
It was I, after all,
who introduced

31:06.458 --> 31:08.917
the humble Miss Watson-Scott,
as she then was,

31:09.166 --> 31:12.750
to the beau monde
at your dear father's house.

31:12.834 --> 31:13.792
Who knew then
she was destined to command

31:13.875 --> 31:17.625
- Hm.

31:17.709 --> 31:20.583
You're very lucky, you know,
a reprobate like you,

31:20.667 --> 31:22.625
to be invited to
this glittering occasion.

31:22.709 --> 31:25.125
I'm eternally grateful.

31:25.208 --> 31:27.625
- Dying for a drink.

31:28.792 --> 31:33.333
Well, this is quite delicious,
you have my sympathy.

31:33.417 --> 31:34.792
I've never been a heroin addict

31:34.875 --> 31:37.333
but I did have
to give up cigarettes,

31:37.417 --> 31:39.709
- which was quite hard enough.
- Oh, dear.

31:39.792 --> 31:42.333
- Do you think someone--

31:46.625 --> 31:48.375
Are you looking for someone?

31:48.458 --> 31:51.667
I wanted to meet
Princess Margaret.

31:51.750 --> 31:53.458
I see.

31:53.542 --> 31:57.291
Well, I think you'd be
better off without, believe me.

31:57.375 --> 31:59.375
Why don't we ask
your mother to come over?

31:59.458 --> 32:01.542
Oh, look. There's a little
person who can't sleep.

32:03.417 --> 32:04.834
Who is that?

32:04.917 --> 32:07.208
I'm afraid it's my daughter,
Ma'am.

32:07.291 --> 32:10.917
- She should be in bed.
- Thank you, Patrick.

32:11.166 --> 32:13.792
Darling, what are you doing up?
This is a dinner for grown-ups.

32:14.041 --> 32:16.500
- Yes.

32:16.583 --> 32:19.458
Why don't you get your mother
to present you to her?

32:19.542 --> 32:21.000
Will you, Mummy

32:21.083 --> 32:23.333
Are you involved in politics?
For my own part,

32:23.417 --> 32:25.333
I don't mind who's in government
if they're good at governing.

32:25.417 --> 32:29.625
What we must avoid at all costs
is these windscreen wipers:

32:29.709 --> 32:32.458
left, right, left, right...

32:32.542 --> 32:34.000
- Ma'am, I'd like to introduce--
- Not now.

32:34.250 --> 32:37.333
She should be in bed.
She'll only get over-excited.

32:37.417 --> 32:40.375
Quite right. Honestly,
darling, how did she escape?

32:40.458 --> 32:42.667
Go on.

32:43.291 --> 32:45.959
Now, I really think it's
about time we joined the others.

32:46.041 --> 32:48.000
Oh, must we?

32:48.083 --> 32:50.792
We've been having
such a cozy time.

32:50.875 --> 32:53.875
I do so hate big parties.

32:54.125 --> 32:58.166
So do I.
It was all my wife's idea.

♪ Waaaaaah! ♪

33:02.542 --> 33:05.208
♪ Put the candles on the cake ♪

33:05.291 --> 33:07.542

33:12.500 --> 33:14.792

33:32.583 --> 33:34.250
Sonny and I
are so grateful to you.

33:34.333 --> 33:37.250
Oh. Anything for Sonny.
Try to avoid Bridget, though.

33:37.333 --> 33:39.250
- She can be rather fierce.
- Of course.

33:39.333 --> 33:42.333
If security asks, you're to
pretend to be my wife.

33:43.291 --> 33:45.959
How far am I
meant to go with that?

33:52.750 --> 33:54.709
Oh, Patrick's here.

33:56.542 --> 33:59.417
Oh, Christ.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.625
Sir.

34:18.208 --> 34:21.458
My dear, what a nice surprise!

34:21.542 --> 34:23.291
- George!

34:23.375 --> 34:26.291
I'm sitting here because I
can't hear anything otherwise.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.917
I thought people
were supposed to lead lives

34:29.000 --> 34:31.875
- of quiet desperation.
- Not quiet enough.

34:31.959 --> 34:37.291
Now. Have you found something
that you enjoy doing?

34:37.375 --> 34:40.458
Yes, but sadly
I've had to give that up.

34:40.542 --> 34:42.458
Then you're guilty
of the greatest sin of all.

34:42.542 --> 34:45.333
- Wasting time.

34:45.417 --> 34:46.917
You must make a contribution.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.291
No man is an island,

34:48.375 --> 34:49.917
though there are a surprising
number here who own one.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.959
And not just in Scotland.

34:53.583 --> 34:55.583
Though, of course you're right.

34:56.583 --> 34:58.875
My father once said to me:

34:58.959 --> 35:02.041
"If you have a talent, use it.

35:02.125 --> 35:05.333
Or you'll be miserable
all your life."

35:06.041 --> 35:08.458
It was just about the only
non-hostile remark he ever made.

35:08.542 --> 35:13.834
He was a very brilliant man,
but he was never happy, I think.

35:13.917 --> 35:17.834
Yes, well...I hardly
ever think of him these days.

35:17.917 --> 35:22.375
He would've hated you to make
the same mistakes, Patrick.

35:23.917 --> 35:27.041
No more wasted time.

35:31.625 --> 35:33.792
I...I must...go and find my...

35:33.875 --> 35:37.208
Yes, yes, yes. Go. Go.

35:46.750 --> 35:48.458
- Patrick.
- Debbie.

35:48.542 --> 35:49.250
You look lovely.

35:49.333 --> 35:51.625
But then
you always did at parties.

35:51.709 --> 35:53.041
I'm surprised you remember.

35:53.125 --> 35:54.917
You were either upstairs
in bed with someone else,

35:55.000 --> 35:56.709
or passed out in the loo.

35:56.792 --> 35:58.375
Yes, that's actually something
I wanted to talk to you about.

35:58.458 --> 36:01.083
I don't think I was
terribly nice to you and I--

36:01.166 --> 36:04.041
I know this one. This is
a 12

36:04.125 --> 36:06.959
I'm part of your
"moral inventory".

36:07.041 --> 36:09.333
- No, I just--

36:09.417 --> 36:11.917
David, Cindy!

36:12.000 --> 36:14.417
Cindy. You made it!

36:14.500 --> 36:16.041
- Happy birthday, darling.

36:16.125 --> 36:19.291
Sonny, are you sure
this is all above board?

36:19.375 --> 36:22.291
Bridget just gave me
the most terrible scowling look.

36:22.375 --> 36:23.917
Just stick to the story.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.500
You met Cindy,
your wife couldn't come,

36:25.583 --> 36:27.834
asked her instead, didn't check
- it's nothing to do with me.

36:27.917 --> 36:29.417
Right. So, erm...

36:29.500 --> 36:33.959
I met Cindy, wife couldn't come,
asked Cindy instead...

36:38.750 --> 36:41.583
- Hello, you.
- Happy birthday, darling.

36:43.125 --> 36:44.000
- So glad you're here.

36:44.083 --> 36:46.417
It's the best birthday present--

36:46.500 --> 36:47.917
What I find with beautiful women

36:48.000 --> 36:50.875
is that after one's
waited around for ages,

36:51.000 --> 36:55.125
they all arrive at once, like
buses are supposed to do.

36:55.208 --> 36:58.333
Not that I've ever waited
around for a bus.

36:58.417 --> 37:00.041
Look at Princess Margaret.

37:00.125 --> 37:02.333
One has to be careful
not to trip over her.

37:02.417 --> 37:03.625
That was quite a scene.

37:03.709 --> 37:07.083
Mm. Yes, I do admire P.M.

37:07.166 --> 37:10.333
She has something of
your father's joie-de-vivre.

37:10.417 --> 37:12.333
- Imagine if they'd met!
- Imagine.

37:12.417 --> 37:14.667
The way she used
a minor accident

37:14.750 --> 37:18.041
to screw maximum humiliation
out of the Ambassador.

37:19.041 --> 37:21.458
Of course I'm absolutely
devoted to his wife, who,

37:21.542 --> 37:26.709
behind that phoney chic,
is a genuinely malicious person.

37:26.792 --> 37:29.333
- And here they are!

37:29.417 --> 37:31.709
I must go and talk
to our hostess.

37:32.542 --> 37:34.917
I hope we didn't drive
away your young friend.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.625
- He seemed very nervous.
- Oh, we can get on without him.

37:37.709 --> 37:40.875
Mon cher Jacques, I thought
you were absolutely brilliant,

37:40.959 --> 37:43.291
the way you handled
that tiresome woman.

37:43.542 --> 37:46.542
Thank you, but I feel the royal
presence bearing down on us.

37:46.625 --> 37:49.667
Maybe we could explore
the depths of the party.

37:49.750 --> 37:52.375
My dear fellow,
you are the depths of the party.

37:52.458 --> 37:54.000
- Au revoir!

37:54.083 --> 37:54.875
A tout à l'heure.

37:54.959 --> 37:57.583
Consorting with the enemy?

37:57.667 --> 37:59.375
They came to me
for sympathy, Ma'am.

37:59.458 --> 38:01.875
I told them they'd come
to the wrong place!

38:01.959 --> 38:05.500
He's a clumsy fool,
and as to his absurd wife...

38:05.583 --> 38:08.667
Hello, there!
Isn't this a lovely party?

38:08.959 --> 38:11.041
Ma'am.

38:11.125 --> 38:13.875
I'll come and find you later,
alright?

38:14.000 --> 38:15.750
Oh. Yes.

38:18.625 --> 38:20.709
- My daughter.

38:21.583 --> 38:26.542
Now, where was I?
I've quite lost my flow...

38:27.041 --> 38:28.417
The main thing I remember,

38:28.500 --> 38:30.875
apart from
your poisonous father,

38:30.959 --> 38:33.166
was that beautiful house.

38:33.417 --> 38:34.709
Nothing compared to all of this.

38:34.792 --> 38:36.041
Ohhh!

38:36.125 --> 38:38.041
Yes,
it's funny how things turn out.

38:38.959 --> 38:42.417
It's all lovely, I just wish it
wasn't full of such awful shits.

38:42.500 --> 38:44.542
Not you, of course.
Or Mummy.

38:45.333 --> 38:47.792
- You seemed...

38:48.750 --> 38:51.917
incredibly cool to me,
unlike my parents' usual crowd.

38:52.000 --> 38:52.583
And kinder too.

38:52.667 --> 38:54.709
Kind?

38:54.792 --> 38:57.583
You're sure you're not confusing
me with someone else?

38:57.667 --> 39:00.041
You wouldn't be an angel
and talk to her for a second?

39:00.125 --> 39:02.709
Mummy?
- Oh.

39:02.792 --> 39:04.792
This is my old friend
Patrick Melrose.

39:04.875 --> 39:09.208
- Oh, yes, I remember.
- So. Quite a party!

39:14.166 --> 39:17.083
Bridget! Lovely party!

39:17.166 --> 39:19.166
I just wanted to clarify:

39:19.250 --> 39:21.625
I met Cindy,
my wife couldn't come, so...

39:25.125 --> 39:28.083
..starts to show.
May I touch it?

39:28.166 --> 39:31.625
Oh, Sonny.
There's nothing to touch.

Not for weeks yet.

I said we shouldn't invite her
'cause we didn't know her

39:56.000 --> 39:58.250
and now she's here.

- Happy birthday, Sonny!
- Don Wills on the trombone!

40:27.917 --> 40:30.500
You know,
I frightfully dislike this bit.

40:30.583 --> 40:33.875
What makes you think
we wanna know their names?

40:33.959 --> 40:37.375
- Saw you talking to Bridget...
- Chilly Willy Watson on cornet.

40:37.458 --> 40:40.083
- She looked awfully stormy.

40:42.875 --> 40:45.250
Sonny, may I steal Patrick
for a moment?

40:46.792 --> 40:49.959
- Chilly Willy Watson!

40:51.583 --> 40:53.000
Yes, sorry, I...
I just thought I...

40:53.083 --> 40:55.834
Let's go here.

40:57.041 --> 40:58.375
I thought I'd save you
from our host.

40:58.458 --> 41:01.083
Oh! There's an air
of palpable stupidity

41:01.166 --> 41:03.250
that comes off that man,

41:03.333 --> 41:04.375
like opening the door
to a sauna.

41:04.458 --> 41:06.875
It makes sense.
No.

41:06.959 --> 41:10.166
- No, I can't tell her tonight.
- You can tell her I'm...

41:10.250 --> 41:13.542
My God, look at them all.

41:13.625 --> 41:15.041
I remember these people
from my childhood.

41:15.125 --> 41:17.125
Hard and dull.

41:17.208 --> 41:19.291
- They're the last Marxists.

41:20.792 --> 41:24.500
The last people to believe
class is a total explanation.

41:25.291 --> 41:27.834
Let's get out of here.
Come on.

41:31.834 --> 41:34.041
What are you two
muttering about?

41:34.125 --> 41:36.291
Hello, stranger.

41:36.375 --> 41:37.625
Oh, Christ.

41:37.709 --> 41:39.875
Johnny, Patrick,
this is my husband.

41:39.959 --> 41:42.500
- This is Angus.
- Quite a party.

41:42.583 --> 41:45.792
Must have cost
a pretty penny, eh?

41:47.000 --> 41:51.000
My husband is obsessed
with how much everything costs.

41:51.083 --> 41:53.208
Why don't you get me a drink?
They're free.

41:53.291 --> 41:55.125
- Johnny will help you.
- Actually,

41:55.208 --> 41:57.625
- Johnny and I were just
about to--
Come on!

42:00.000 --> 42:02.083
He looked so good on paper

42:02.166 --> 42:04.750
but he's completely obsessed
with whether a cheap-day return

42:04.834 --> 42:07.250
is refundable if you don't
use the second half.

42:09.750 --> 42:13.750
Shall we go exploring?
It's very good to see you again.

42:14.625 --> 42:16.542
I thought perhaps
you'd been avoiding me.

42:16.625 --> 42:19.709
- As a bad influence.
- Not you. The world.

42:20.667 --> 42:22.750
Well... You're here now.

42:24.208 --> 42:27.166
Perhaps we can liven up
this dreary party.

42:27.250 --> 42:30.792
You certainly have to kick a lot
of bodies to find a live one.

42:30.875 --> 42:32.417
Tony's got some charlie.

42:32.500 --> 42:33.542
I suppose
that's against the rules now.

42:33.625 --> 42:37.375
- I think technically, yes.

42:37.458 --> 42:40.333
Christ, why are you all so dull?

42:41.542 --> 42:43.917
Men used to talk to me about how
they used butter for sex.

42:44.000 --> 42:48.083
Now they tell me how they've
eliminated it from their diet.

42:49.542 --> 42:53.041
Look, there's Debbie.
Doesn't she look beautiful?

42:53.542 --> 42:55.500
Very.

42:56.291 --> 42:58.291
I suppose
I'd better go and find Johnny.

42:58.375 --> 43:01.291
- We could always go upstairs.

43:01.375 --> 43:04.458
For sex. No strings.

43:07.250 --> 43:09.667
Well,
I suppose it's something to do.

43:09.750 --> 43:12.375
- Thank you.
- No, no, I'm very keen.

43:13.458 --> 43:15.917
- Well, come on, then, let's go.

43:22.875 --> 43:25.500
- I'm sorry, ma'am, the house--
- We're staying here.

43:26.667 --> 43:29.709
- Thank you!

43:36.458 --> 43:38.458
I can't help thinking
this is a terrible idea.

43:38.709 --> 43:42.125
- Sssh! Listen!

43:42.208 --> 43:43.792
..humiliating that is!

43:43.875 --> 43:44.667
Please talk about this
in the morning.

43:44.750 --> 43:47.375
We
will talk about it now!

43:47.458 --> 43:49.583
Our guests are
beginning to wonder where we--

43:49.667 --> 43:51.375
I don't care about
your fucking guests!

43:51.458 --> 43:54.667
Tell me, is it the first time...

43:55.375 --> 43:56.917
You must have heard.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.500
- Oh, it gets better.

43:59.583 --> 44:02.333
Cindy's pregnant
with a precious boy-child.

44:02.417 --> 44:05.208
Sonny's so desperate for a male
heir he's going to make Cindy

44:05.291 --> 44:07.917
- next Countess of Gravesend.
- Poor Bridget.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.834
Like some tin-pot Henry VIII.

44:09.917 --> 44:13.125
- Honestly, you have to laugh.
- Well, you don't have to laugh.

44:13.208 --> 44:16.333
Oh, don't be so pious.
Serves her right.

44:16.417 --> 44:17.875
- You know what for.

44:17.959 --> 44:22.375
All that climbing.
No wonder she looks so tired.

44:22.458 --> 44:25.125
You know, I have my reservations
about your character.

44:25.208 --> 44:27.542
- Me too. Quick - let's go.

44:27.625 --> 44:31.625
No! Yes, yes, alright,
but not in our bedroom!

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
Ooh!

44:45.250 --> 44:47.291
Guess who
I'm having an affair with?

44:48.166 --> 44:50.750
Do we have to talk
about this now?

44:50.834 --> 44:52.875
Your friend Johnny.

44:55.667 --> 44:58.917
That's completely put me off.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.709
I thought you might want
to steal me back.

45:02.750 --> 45:04.000
Johnny's perfectly nice
but that's the problem.

45:06.959 --> 45:10.959
I was so pleased when I found
out you were coming tonight.

45:12.041 --> 45:13.458
Patrick Melrose.

45:13.542 --> 45:16.625
It took me by surprise.

45:16.709 --> 45:19.875
- The fact is, I've missed you.
- Me... Me too.

45:19.959 --> 45:22.166
But I think...

45:23.291 --> 45:26.583
I think I'd prefer to
remain friends with Johnny.

45:28.625 --> 45:30.458
Really?

45:30.542 --> 45:33.125
I just don't want
any more irony and tension.

45:33.208 --> 45:35.458
But you love irony and tension!

45:35.542 --> 45:38.041
I think you imagine
everyone else is just like you.

45:38.125 --> 45:39.625
Fuck off, Patrick.

45:39.709 --> 45:42.375
Alright, I think we'd
better go down, don't you?

45:42.458 --> 45:44.959
Before we have a row.

45:45.041 --> 45:47.458
- You go first.
- God, you're a pain.

46:03.166 --> 46:04.625
Oh, God.

46:25.834 --> 46:28.208
I broke a glass.
Don't tell my father.

46:28.291 --> 46:31.542
What about your mother?
Do you wanna tell your mother?

46:31.625 --> 46:33.750
Patrick...what is it, love?

46:35.709 --> 46:37.750
What would you
have said to him?

46:46.458 --> 46:48.500
"Power Of Love"

46:53.709 --> 46:55.083
I was looking for you.
Where have you been?

46:55.166 --> 46:58.458
Nowhere. I wonder -
can we find somewhere to talk?

46:58.542 --> 47:01.500
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

47:02.875 --> 47:04.041
I told you there's something

47:04.125 --> 47:06.500
I've never said out loud
and never would.

47:06.583 --> 47:08.792
And now I'm going to.

47:09.041 --> 47:11.166
Forgive my inarticulacy,
it's not that I'm embarrassed,

47:11.250 --> 47:14.542
it's just... I don't want it
to be a burden for you.

47:14.625 --> 47:16.125
- Just go ahead.

47:17.375 --> 47:18.583
So.

47:18.667 --> 47:21.583
I've told you about my parents'
drunkenness and the violence,

47:21.667 --> 47:23.291
but what I was skirting around--

47:23.375 --> 47:25.500
- Not now.
- No, thank you.

47:25.583 --> 47:27.125
Just to let you know
the fireworks

47:27.208 --> 47:29.625
- will start in a few minutes.
- Thank you.

47:36.709 --> 47:40.583
When I was eight,
and for some years afterwards

47:40.667 --> 47:43.458
my father "abused" me

47:43.542 --> 47:46.417
as...we're invited
to call it these days.

47:47.625 --> 47:48.458
What do you mean, "abused"?

47:48.542 --> 47:51.959
I...

47:58.834 --> 48:00.917
It was...

48:02.500 --> 48:04.500
Oh, God...

48:08.166 --> 48:10.333
Nobody should do that
to anybody else.

48:14.542 --> 48:16.208
- The first time--
- The fireworks are about--

48:16.291 --> 48:18.125
Do you think you could leave us
alone for one fucking minute

48:18.208 --> 48:20.750
- I'm sorry, sir.

48:21.000 --> 48:22.125
Do we look like children?

48:22.208 --> 48:25.166
Do we look like we're interested
in the fucking fireworks?

48:31.083 --> 48:33.083
What do I mean by abused?

48:33.709 --> 48:35.458
I mean sexually abused.

48:35.542 --> 48:38.542
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

48:40.250 --> 48:41.625
No wonder you hated him so much.

48:41.709 --> 48:44.667
Well, now you know.

48:49.333 --> 48:50.834
The first incident
masqueraded as a punishment,

48:50.917 --> 48:54.000
though I never knew the crime...

48:54.083 --> 48:58.041
which gave it a certain
Kafkaesque  charm..

48:58.125 --> 48:59.709
What a bastard.

49:01.667 --> 49:03.208
It must have split
the world in half.

49:08.166 --> 49:10.208
Yes, I think
that is what happened.

49:15.208 --> 49:16.542
What makes you think that?

49:16.625 --> 49:19.625
It just seemed obvious.

49:26.208 --> 49:28.041
In that moment,
when it was happening -

49:28.125 --> 49:30.792
this will sound strange, but...

49:33.291 --> 49:36.333
..there was a lizard
on the wall.

49:36.417 --> 49:38.375
A gecko, bright green.

49:40.625 --> 49:43.458
I thought, "If I can
somehow put myself inside...

49:46.625 --> 49:49.208
..then I might be able
to get through this."

49:51.875 --> 49:54.542
Not much of an escape plan,
I know.

49:55.458 --> 49:56.834
Ahhh...

49:59.875 --> 50:01.333
The point is...

50:02.125 --> 50:04.709
..now I'm exhausted hating him.

50:04.792 --> 50:07.291
It's not enough.

50:07.375 --> 50:09.875
And if I'm going
to break out into the world

50:09.959 --> 50:12.750
not just this -
but the real world,

50:12.834 --> 50:15.250
to learn something,
make a contribution,

50:15.333 --> 50:17.208
live rather than just survive,

50:17.291 --> 50:20.959
then I am going to have to
say these things out loud.

50:27.875 --> 50:32.583
We are missing
the fireworks, if you want to--

50:32.667 --> 50:34.750
It's alright.

50:34.834 --> 50:36.750
I wondered whether perhaps
you'd like your old room back?

50:36.834 --> 50:38.917
Oh, Mummy, I don't know.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.250
Can we just talk about it
when we get there?

50:41.333 --> 50:44.208
- Whatever makes you happy.

50:47.333 --> 50:49.375
I've treated you dreadfully
sometimes.

50:52.917 --> 50:55.166
- Snobbishly.
- Oh, no.

50:57.709 --> 50:59.959
Only sometimes.

51:02.375 --> 51:05.542
Your father always blamed
that Nicholas Pratt man.

51:07.625 --> 51:09.625
You were such a nice girl
until you met him,

51:09.709 --> 51:14.291
and then you started
criticizing everything at home,

51:14.375 --> 51:18.625
people you'd known all your
life - perfectly nice people.

51:20.875 --> 51:22.792
Your father always loved you,
but...

51:22.875 --> 51:25.250
I can't pretend
he wasn't hurt sometimes.

51:25.333 --> 51:27.500
[fireworks whistle and pop
in distance]

51:31.250 --> 51:33.208
- No!

51:33.291 --> 51:35.291
Not at all.

51:36.250 --> 51:39.375
Let's have a nice
long talk tomorrow.

51:40.583 --> 51:43.542
We should probably get going.
We've a long way to go.

51:43.625 --> 51:45.792
Yes.

51:46.792 --> 51:50.208
- I'm not recruiting, I swear.
- Go on.

51:50.291 --> 51:56.166
Perhaps the only way to
move on is to become...

51:56.250 --> 51:57.917
more detached from yourself...

51:58.917 --> 52:00.583
..and more attached
to something else.

52:05.291 --> 52:07.250
Someone else.

52:08.333 --> 52:10.667
- Fall in love, have kids.
- Hm.

52:11.625 --> 52:13.083
Yeah. Why not?

52:13.166 --> 52:15.875
I tried falling in love,
many times, as you know.

52:15.959 --> 52:17.625
Not sure that was love.

52:17.709 --> 52:19.709
Even so, my experience of love:

52:19.792 --> 52:22.834
you get excited thinking someone
can mend your broken heart,

52:22.917 --> 52:24.542
disappointed
when you realize they can't.

52:24.625 --> 52:26.583
- But the next time.

52:26.667 --> 52:31.250
Hm. Of course, the other danger
is, without bitterness, spite,

52:31.333 --> 52:33.709
sarcasm, snobbery
and self-loathing,

52:33.792 --> 52:36.500
- there might be nothing left.
- Perhaps.

52:37.542 --> 52:41.834
Or...think what you could
put there instead.

52:52.041 --> 52:55.625
Ah, here's our hostess!

52:55.709 --> 52:57.458
I wanted to find Sonny.

52:57.542 --> 52:59.583
I really couldn't care less,
Ma'am.

53:03.792 --> 53:05.458
- I've been a bloody fool.

53:07.583 --> 53:09.917
Well, I can't say I disagree.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.333
I was driven to it!
Bridget's not having a son

53:12.417 --> 53:13.542
has been frightfully hard.

53:13.625 --> 53:17.667
I'm just not sure I like
the idea of life without her.

53:17.750 --> 53:21.750
And Cindy has got
some very peculiar ideas.

53:21.834 --> 53:23.583
She's already suggested
I knock a wall through.

53:23.667 --> 53:27.542
And she looks at the furniture
like a bloody auctioneer.

53:27.625 --> 53:29.417
Isn't that Bridget now?

53:33.166 --> 53:35.792
- Bridget! Bridget!

53:35.875 --> 53:37.709
Bridget, where are you going?

53:38.917 --> 53:41.625
Bridget! Stop the car! Stop!

54:02.041 --> 54:04.667
Oh, I'm sure my father
was intensely unhappy,

54:04.750 --> 54:05.917
but to forgive someone,

54:06.000 --> 54:07.834
doesn't there have to be
some attempt to change?

54:07.917 --> 54:10.750
But if he'd changed,
he wouldn't need forgiveness.

54:11.250 --> 54:13.792
Excuse me

54:13.875 --> 54:16.834
Erm...I'm sorry
if I snapped at you earlier.

54:16.917 --> 54:19.041
It's just I was in the middle of
saying something rather tricky.

54:19.125 --> 54:21.083
I was only doing my job.

54:21.333 --> 54:24.000
I know you were
and I apologize.

54:24.083 --> 54:26.583
So do you think there's
any way to forgive him?

54:26.667 --> 54:28.500
Of course.
It really wasn't that bad.

54:28.917 --> 54:31.542
No, not you!

54:37.208 --> 54:39.083
Well, if the waiter
can forgive me...

54:40.250 --> 54:43.500
You go ahead. I don't think
I could get to sleep just yet.

54:43.583 --> 54:45.959
And the thought of
that hotel room - oof.

54:46.834 --> 54:48.500
Well, thanks for telling me.

54:48.583 --> 54:50.500
No need to get
Californian about it.

54:50.583 --> 54:52.667
No need to be so English.

Well, let's hope so.

55:21.959 --> 55:23.250
Can I help you?

55:23.333 --> 55:25.834
I knew a Chilly Willy
in New York.

55:26.291 --> 55:28.583
- You're not...

55:31.542 --> 55:33.291

55:33.375 --> 55:37.250
He sold...
He lived on the streets.

55:38.917 --> 55:40.583
It's impossible, I know. I...

56:02.625 --> 56:05.542
I was always a musician, man.

56:05.625 --> 56:09.792
I just er...you know?

56:11.542 --> 56:14.625
Your wife once sold me
a horse syringe for 20 dollars.

56:14.709 --> 56:16.792
- It was like this.
- Yeah, she OD'd.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.333

But then...
everything's a miracle, man.

It's a miracle we don't melt in
the bath like a piece of soap.

- You too.

at breakfast, perhaps?
