TIMECRIMES

01:55.749 --> 02:00.301
Clara!

02:06.427 --> 02:08.089
Clara!

02:11.031 --> 02:13.466
- Didn't you hear me calling you?
- You called me?

02:13.500 --> 02:15.492
- Yeah. You didn't hear me?
- No.

02:17.237 --> 02:19.570
- This was the one you wanted, right?
- Yeah.

02:19.606 --> 02:21.234
- And the fertilizer?
- Up there.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.675
Put it there.

02:22.709 --> 02:25.008
- You'll assemble it out here?
- Sure.

02:27.347 --> 02:28.838
Time flies here.

02:28.882 --> 02:31.477
I'm going upstairs
to lie down.

03:38.352 --> 03:39.718
Telephone!

03:39.753 --> 03:43.588
What?
What did you say?

03:55.869 --> 03:58.668
Yes? Hello?

04:00.974 --> 04:02.203
Who is this?

04:17.324 --> 04:19.623
This is a restricted
terminal.

04:19.660 --> 04:22.994
Record your message
or give your access code.

04:23.030 --> 04:26.728
All right, we got a call
from this number.

04:28.769 --> 04:32.297
- What were you saying?
- Nothing, the phone rang.

04:32.339 --> 04:33.705
Who was it?

04:33.740 --> 04:36.938
They didn't say anything.
But I got some weird machine.

04:36.977 --> 04:39.879
- Probably the workers.
- No, today is Saturday.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.815
Or a neighbor.
Today is Saturday?

04:42.849 --> 04:45.216
I thought
it was Friday.

04:45.252 --> 04:46.914
When is
the painter coming?

04:46.954 --> 04:49.219
Nobody has
our phone number.

04:49.256 --> 04:53.057
Then what's the point
of having a phone?

04:53.093 --> 04:55.221
Huh?

04:58.165 --> 05:00.862
Look at him—too weak
even to argue.

05:02.502 --> 05:04.334
- You haven't slept.
- Yes, I have.

05:04.371 --> 05:08.035
"Yes, I have."
"Yes, I have."

05:24.391 --> 05:26.189
- Shit.
- What?

05:26.226 --> 05:28.218
It's still recording.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.332
This is all set.

05:38.372 --> 05:40.534
You'll never get it
through the door.

05:40.574 --> 05:41.803
Sure I will.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.607
Otherwise,
we'll put it out here.

05:44.645 --> 05:47.513
It's not worth
worrying about.

05:47.547 --> 05:49.448
What do you feel like
for dinner?

05:49.483 --> 05:51.384
I don't know.
What have we got?

05:51.418 --> 05:53.512
I don't know.
There's almost nothing left.

05:53.553 --> 05:56.216
There must be a store
still open in town.

05:56.256 --> 05:58.020
How about
roast chicken?

05:58.058 --> 06:00.220
I'm not taking
the car again.

06:00.260 --> 06:02.627
Come on, I'll
clean up the kitchen.

06:02.663 --> 06:05.030
I don't want
to take the car.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.159
Come on.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.931
I'll go if the table fits
through the door.

06:09.970 --> 06:13.702
Okay, if it doesn't,
I'll go. I promise.

06:13.740 --> 06:15.641
I'm serious—

06:15.676 --> 06:17.577
no changing your
mind later.

06:17.611 --> 06:20.342
- I know you.
- Move move move!

06:20.380 --> 06:21.905
- What's going on?
- I can't see.

06:21.948 --> 06:23.576
Sorry.

06:23.617 --> 06:27.315
There's something
up there in a bush.

06:27.354 --> 06:28.845
Let me see.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.324
- Look.
- Where?

06:31.358 --> 06:34.624
There, by the bush.
There's a clearing on the left.

06:34.661 --> 06:36.994
- I can't see anything.
- Here.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.589
- Where?
- Give it here!

06:38.632 --> 06:40.624
Hey!
Here it is.

07:14.301 --> 07:17.362
- You win.
- What?

07:17.404 --> 07:19.532
The table doesn't fit
in the bedroom.

07:19.573 --> 07:23.101
I'd rather lose the bet
than have you against me.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.578
- Give me the keys.
- Okay.

07:25.612 --> 07:29.674
Never bring this up again.
Not even once, okay?

07:29.716 --> 07:31.014
Yeah.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.417
What's wrong?

07:32.452 --> 07:34.182
What do you mean?

07:34.221 --> 07:36.213
The keys.

07:38.825 --> 07:41.294
Here.

07:41.328 --> 07:44.423
See you later.
I'll leave them by the door.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.456
Okay.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.202
Hello?

14:00.473 --> 14:02.465
Hello!

14:06.813 --> 14:08.805
Hello!

14:55.161 --> 14:56.993
September

16:14.540 --> 16:16.532
Hello?

16:17.677 --> 16:20.272
Is anybody there?

16:20.313 --> 16:21.679
Who is this?

16:23.349 --> 16:25.818
- Listen—
- Who are you?

16:25.852 --> 16:30.790
This is private property.
Where did you get that walkie-talkie?

16:30.823 --> 16:33.884
I need help. A man is after me.
He's trying to kill me.

16:33.926 --> 16:36.521
I jumped the fence
and came in.

16:36.562 --> 16:38.656
What did you say?
You jumped the fence?

16:38.698 --> 16:40.758
What happened?

16:40.800 --> 16:43.827
He stabbed me
in the arm and I ran here.

16:43.870 --> 16:45.964
The door was closed, but—

16:48.941 --> 16:50.773
- What was that?
- What?

16:53.346 --> 16:54.678
It sounded like …

16:54.714 --> 16:57.377
I just heard a thunder.
You mean that?

16:58.685 --> 17:00.085
Yeah, I think so.

17:01.554 --> 17:04.455
Okay, listen.
Stay calm.

17:04.490 --> 17:06.891
I'm in another building.

17:06.925 --> 17:09.191
I'll be right over.
Stay there.

17:09.228 --> 17:11.595
Okay, thanks.

17:48.701 --> 17:49.999
Hello?

17:50.036 --> 17:52.028
- Yes?
- Did you say something?

17:54.507 --> 17:57.534
I have a question— is the man
after you wearing a bandage?

17:57.577 --> 17:59.808
Yeah, a pink one.

17:59.846 --> 18:03.078
- I can see him.
- Where? Where is he?

18:03.116 --> 18:05.881
Far from the house,
don't worry.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.944
There are surveillance
cameras everywhere.

18:07.987 --> 18:10.513
I have the monitors
in front of me.

18:11.657 --> 18:13.626
He jumped the fence.

18:13.659 --> 18:16.925
Is he coming this way?
Please, call the police.

18:16.963 --> 18:20.923
I'll call them right now.
Hold on.

18:20.967 --> 18:23.232
Stay where you are.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.100
Hello?

18:31.144 --> 18:33.579
- Hello?
- Well, how did it go?

18:33.613 --> 18:35.206
I don't get it.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.217
What's wrong?

18:37.250 --> 18:39.617
I can't get
an outside line.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.143
You don't have a cell?

18:41.187 --> 18:43.486
There's no coverage
out here.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.992
- What is he doing?
- Walking.

18:46.025 --> 18:47.721
- In this direction?
- Yeah.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.389
Listen to me—
I broke a window.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.399
If he sees it, he'll know I'm here.
What should I do?

18:52.432 --> 18:54.492
I don't know.
Where are you?

18:54.534 --> 18:57.595
In a laboratory.
I blocked the door.

18:57.637 --> 19:01.096
No, come up here.
It's much safer.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.972
Where?

19:03.009 --> 19:05.604
I'm in a silo at the edge
of the property, up the hill.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.011
And?

19:07.046 --> 19:10.539
There's a door
down the hall on the right.

19:10.583 --> 19:13.985
Come up the hill. He's coming
from the other side of the house.

19:14.020 --> 19:15.921
I don't think he'll
see you.

19:15.955 --> 19:19.016
If he goes inside,
he'll find you.

19:19.058 --> 19:22.392
He's getting closer.
Get out of there.

19:22.428 --> 19:24.454
Get out of there!

19:37.477 --> 19:39.412
- I'm coming out.
- Okay.

19:45.084 --> 19:47.883
That was me.
Come up the path.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.821
Stay on it.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.727
Hurry up.
The sooner you get here,

19:56.762 --> 20:00.255
the sooner I can turn off the lights.
He shouldn't see them.

20:00.299 --> 20:03.667
- Where is he?
- He's approaching the house.

20:05.137 --> 20:08.539
- What is he doing?
- Keep quiet, I'll guide you.

20:08.574 --> 20:11.066
He's checking the windows.

20:13.246 --> 20:15.238
He's seen the broken one.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.942
- Is he going in?
- Keep quiet.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.525
He's going
around the house.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.528
He's seen the path.
Hold on.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.189
Impossible—

20:30.229 --> 20:33.461
I've lost the signal
from one of the cameras.

20:33.499 --> 20:36.526
I've lost another.
Shit, I can't see anything!

20:36.569 --> 20:38.561
I don't know where he is!
Run!

20:53.519 --> 20:55.784
Please turn
off the lights.

21:09.268 --> 21:12.136
I see something on up there.
Is that you?

21:12.171 --> 21:14.697
That's me, it's okay.

21:19.312 --> 21:20.575
I hear a car.

21:23.382 --> 21:25.317
It's him!
He's coming up!

21:44.070 --> 21:45.163
Can he get in?

21:45.204 --> 21:46.331
No, it's okay.

21:46.372 --> 21:48.341
- Can you lock that?
- No.

21:48.374 --> 21:50.707
- Shit, let's go.
- There's nowhere else to go.

21:50.743 --> 21:53.577
We're safe here.

22:00.252 --> 22:02.244
What is all this?

22:05.358 --> 22:07.327
You can hide
in there.

22:07.360 --> 22:10.387
What? What is that?

22:13.065 --> 22:15.830
Look.

22:18.804 --> 22:21.205
I can lower the hatch
to hide you.

22:34.887 --> 22:36.515
Does this door have a lock?

22:36.555 --> 22:38.615
Is there another door?
Another way out?

22:38.658 --> 22:40.251
Can we turn off
these damn lights?

22:43.429 --> 22:45.864
He'll never think
to look in there.

22:45.898 --> 22:48.834
What about you?

22:48.868 --> 22:51.929
I have to lower
the hatch from here.

22:51.971 --> 22:54.372
I'll activate it
and get in with you.

23:11.524 --> 23:13.516
Okay.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.127
Come on!

23:23.636 --> 23:25.628
Hey!

23:27.473 --> 23:29.465
Hey!

24:40.513 --> 24:42.641
Who are you?

24:43.983 --> 24:45.645
What?

24:46.752 --> 24:48.311
Who are you?

24:55.394 --> 24:57.886
What?

24:57.930 --> 25:00.092
What did you do to me?

25:00.132 --> 25:02.795
- I don't know what you mean.
- You said you'd get in with me.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.929
I said what?

25:10.910 --> 25:13.106
You've been here
before, right?

25:13.145 --> 25:15.512
Was the tank full
of white liquid?

25:26.425 --> 25:28.519
We've seen each other
before, right?

25:35.234 --> 25:38.671
The liquid
you're soaked in …

25:38.704 --> 25:41.970
That tank is
still a prototype.

25:42.007 --> 25:43.703
It's actually
a …

26:03.562 --> 26:05.827
- This was the one you wanted, right?
- Yeah.

26:05.865 --> 26:07.800
- And the fertilizer?
- Up there.

26:07.833 --> 26:10.132
Put it there.

26:39.965 --> 26:41.957
You went back in time.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.641
- Where are you going?
- Home, to call the police.

26:50.676 --> 26:53.236
- No, wait.
- Stay away from me.

26:53.279 --> 26:55.908
For God's sake,
you can't go home.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.577
What?

26:58.617 --> 27:00.950
You're already home.
Want another look?

27:22.041 --> 27:24.442
- They're doing exactly what—
- Listen.

27:25.911 --> 27:27.709
Today is September
16, 2006.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.511
No, it can't be.

27:31.550 --> 27:33.781
What day did you
think it was?

27:33.819 --> 27:36.880
I don't know, but I got in the tank
on the 16th, and it was night already.

27:38.457 --> 27:40.187
So you only traveled …

27:41.193 --> 27:44.027
a little while.

27:47.166 --> 27:50.193
What do you mean,
a little while?

27:50.235 --> 27:53.171
You're not listening.
You traveled in time—

27:53.205 --> 27:56.573
into the past. That's why
you can see yourself.

27:56.608 --> 27:59.772
You traveled to a past
where you're still at home,

27:59.812 --> 28:01.440
in your garden.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.073
So what do I do now?

28:04.283 --> 28:06.479
How did you get
in the machine?

28:09.588 --> 28:12.990
How did I get in?
Look, I was at home, okay?

28:13.025 --> 28:15.017
- And suddenly …
- Don't tell me.

28:15.060 --> 28:17.086
It's better
not to know details.

28:17.129 --> 28:19.963
You found me
at the silo

28:19.999 --> 28:23.060
- and I asked you to get in the tank.
- Yeah, but you …

28:23.102 --> 28:25.094
Well, if that's
how it was …

28:26.638 --> 28:29.437
- everything is solved.
- Why?

28:29.475 --> 28:31.205
All you have
to do is wait.

28:31.243 --> 28:33.508
Wait for what?

28:34.513 --> 28:36.607
There's
nobody else here.

28:36.648 --> 28:38.640
Come on.

28:43.255 --> 28:44.587
What was your name again?

28:44.623 --> 28:46.148
- Héctor.
- Héctor, right.

28:46.191 --> 28:48.683
Who is the man
in my home?

28:49.695 --> 28:51.357
He's you.

28:51.397 --> 28:54.265
- He's me?
- Technically, you're the same person.

28:54.299 --> 28:56.097
He's like your reflection.

28:56.135 --> 28:58.104
You're looking in the mirror.

28:58.137 --> 29:00.129
Only this mirror shows
what you were doing

29:00.172 --> 29:02.732
roughly about an hour ago.

29:08.914 --> 29:11.281
But that man is
in my home.

29:11.316 --> 29:13.945
And he'll leave,
just as you did.

29:15.921 --> 29:17.446
How can I put this?

29:24.263 --> 29:26.255
Come on.

29:40.279 --> 29:41.907
Excuse me.

29:41.947 --> 29:44.473
- You want one?
- No.

29:44.516 --> 29:46.007
Sit over there.

29:58.797 --> 30:01.028
This is you.

30:01.066 --> 30:03.934
This arrow moves forward
from past to future, okay?

30:03.969 --> 30:06.131
But at this point
you enter the tank

30:06.171 --> 30:08.731
and travel an hour
and a half into the past—

30:08.774 --> 30:11.539
to here.

30:11.577 --> 30:14.206
You become a sort
of Héctor 2.

30:14.246 --> 30:16.715
- The one at your house is Héctor 1.
- Héctor 1?

30:16.748 --> 30:19.411
Héctor 1— your reflection
in the mirror, remember?

30:19.451 --> 30:21.579
Look, you're here.
You're seeing yourself,

30:21.620 --> 30:23.851
but there's only one arrow.

30:23.889 --> 30:25.949
For how long?

30:25.991 --> 30:27.584
Your reflection
will last up to here.

30:28.994 --> 30:31.793
Here's what we'll do.
You hide here,

30:31.830 --> 30:33.662
while I'll configure
the tank in the basement

30:33.699 --> 30:35.497
and go up to the silo.
I'll have it ready

30:35.534 --> 30:38.663
and I'll wait for nightfall.
Héctor 1 will show up.

30:38.704 --> 30:42.300
I'll get him into the machine
and send him to the past.

30:42.341 --> 30:44.435
- So here's the deal.
- What deal?

30:58.123 --> 30:59.614
I'll bring everything
back to normal

30:59.658 --> 31:02.753
and you won't tell anyone
about any of this.

31:05.130 --> 31:06.928
I shouldn't be here.

31:06.965 --> 31:09.628
The center is normally
closed weekends,

31:09.668 --> 31:12.228
but I felt like staying.

31:15.440 --> 31:17.432
I'm going up.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.552
Yes?

32:10.596 --> 32:12.588
Hello?

32:14.066 --> 32:16.695
Who is this?

32:36.521 --> 32:38.183
What the fuck?

32:39.691 --> 32:41.819
This is a restricted
terminal.

32:41.860 --> 32:45.490
Record your message
or give your access code.

32:45.530 --> 32:49.729
All right, we got a call
from this number.

32:51.436 --> 32:55.134
- What were you saying?
- Nothing, the phone rang.

32:55.173 --> 32:57.165
- Who was it?
- They didn't say anything.

32:57.209 --> 32:58.905
But I got
some weird machine.

32:58.944 --> 33:00.936
- Probably the workers.
- What is this?

33:02.347 --> 33:03.975
You called your house?

33:04.016 --> 33:06.110
- Today is Saturday?
- I say lay low

33:06.151 --> 33:09.349
- and you call your house?
- You can't stop me.

33:09.388 --> 33:11.357
Nobody has
our phone number.

33:11.390 --> 33:13.689
- Did you talk to yourself?
- No.

33:13.725 --> 33:15.250
I called my house
and that's it.

33:15.294 --> 33:17.126
Did you talk to yourself?

33:17.162 --> 33:20.655
My wife is at home
with that—

33:20.699 --> 33:24.932
Look at him—
too weak to even argue.

33:24.970 --> 33:26.802
- You haven't slept.
- Yes, I have.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.774
"Yes, I have."
"Yes, I have."

33:32.144 --> 33:34.375
Do you remember
getting that call?

33:34.413 --> 33:38.077
At your house?
Do you remember answering?

33:38.116 --> 33:39.379
Yes.

33:39.418 --> 33:42.718
Before I left,
I got a call from myself.

33:44.189 --> 33:47.887
Then everything
still fits, right?

33:52.097 --> 33:54.089
I'm going up to the silo.

33:54.132 --> 33:56.624
The tank needs to be filled.

33:59.271 --> 34:03.936
I can't put a chain on you,
or lock you in the basement.

34:03.975 --> 34:06.001
But if you alter events

34:06.044 --> 34:08.411
and stop Héctor 1
from getting in the tank,

34:08.447 --> 34:10.813
it will be the end of your life
as you know it.

34:10.849 --> 34:13.717
Shit.
It's still recording.

34:13.752 --> 34:17.951
And your wife will still prefer being
with him to being with you.

34:19.623 --> 34:22.219
Can't I just go home
and explain?

34:27.065 --> 34:28.829
There are rooms
upstairs.

34:28.867 --> 34:31.132
I'll come and get you
when it's over.

34:31.168 --> 34:33.228
- Uh—
- I …

34:56.695 --> 34:58.687
Fuck!

38:14.926 --> 38:18.920
- Who is that man in my home?
- He's you.

38:18.964 --> 38:21.365
But that man is in my home.

38:21.399 --> 38:24.426
And he'll leave just as you did.

38:24.469 --> 38:27.564
Technically, you're the same person.
He's like your reflection.

38:27.606 --> 38:30.269
Can't I just go home
and explain?

38:30.308 --> 38:33.437
It will be the end
of your life as you know it.

38:33.478 --> 38:35.140
What am I supposed
to do now?

38:38.883 --> 38:43.014
- My God! What the fuck?
- Hello?

38:49.661 --> 38:51.653
Are you all right?

39:06.044 --> 39:07.239
I'm okay.

39:11.383 --> 39:14.751
What happened
to your face?

39:16.187 --> 39:18.986
I got hit—
nothing serious.

39:19.024 --> 39:21.493
Don't move.
I'll be right back.

39:21.526 --> 39:23.518
I'll call an ambulance.

39:45.250 --> 39:48.015
What are you doing?

39:48.053 --> 39:50.045
I said to stay put.

39:50.088 --> 39:51.989
No, I'm okay.

40:04.035 --> 40:06.231
No signal.

40:06.271 --> 40:09.070
I'll find a phone.
Wait for me here.

40:09.107 --> 40:11.770
No, don't go!

40:11.810 --> 40:13.904
Please.

40:13.945 --> 40:16.141
I'm a little dizzy.

40:18.383 --> 40:21.319
Mm, you want
some water?

40:21.352 --> 40:22.650
Yes, thank you.

40:27.492 --> 40:29.188
I'd be right back.

40:30.495 --> 40:33.260
The sooner an ambulance
comes, the better.

40:41.940 --> 40:44.637
Hold on, it'll come
unraveled.

40:56.287 --> 40:58.279
Here, let me.

40:59.657 --> 41:02.320
I was just cutting
my neighbor's hair.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.787
That way
it won't fall off.

41:09.367 --> 41:12.132
I'll go get help.
Wait for me here, okay?

41:26.851 --> 41:29.116
- Wait.
- What's wrong?

41:31.389 --> 41:33.881
I don't know
how to explain this.

41:35.226 --> 41:37.092
I need your help.

41:37.128 --> 41:39.563
- Excuse me?
- Come on.

41:52.443 --> 41:55.902
Have a seat and don't move
until an ambulance comes. Please.

42:03.054 --> 42:04.386
What are you doing?

42:09.561 --> 42:11.530
Let's go, that way.

42:11.563 --> 42:12.861
Why?

42:12.897 --> 42:15.628
- Please. That way.
- No.

42:15.667 --> 42:18.831
I need your help with something.
Come on, follow me.

42:23.808 --> 42:26.676
Let's go back
to the road—that way.

42:26.711 --> 42:29.237
No, keep going forward.

42:31.583 --> 42:33.643
I have to go.

42:38.256 --> 42:39.781
That way.

42:39.824 --> 42:41.816
Please.
Trust me.

42:49.968 --> 42:54.201
Don't worry, it's okay.
I need you to do something.

42:54.239 --> 42:56.868
- I'll explain later.
- Why not now?

42:56.908 --> 42:59.173
It's not easy to explain.

43:10.889 --> 43:12.881
No!

43:23.501 --> 43:25.493
Shit!

44:12.550 --> 44:15.019
Do as I say.

44:31.402 --> 44:33.633
Turn your head
to the right.

44:33.671 --> 44:35.799
No, my right.

44:35.840 --> 44:38.833
Now lower
your head a bit—

44:38.876 --> 44:41.175
a bit more.

44:41.212 --> 44:43.204
Don't look at me.

44:48.286 --> 44:51.688
Now bite
your left thumb—

44:51.723 --> 44:53.715
slowly.

44:55.126 --> 44:58.119
Like you're thinking
of something.

45:03.368 --> 45:05.564
Now pull up your shirt.

45:05.603 --> 45:07.834
Take it off.

45:07.872 --> 45:09.363
Now!

45:10.942 --> 45:12.934
Slowly.

45:21.219 --> 45:23.188
I'm sorry.

45:23.221 --> 45:25.918
Whatever
I ask you to do,

45:25.957 --> 45:28.483
I won't hurt you.

45:29.961 --> 45:32.453
You can put it back on.
We're done. You see?

45:33.831 --> 45:37.029
Can I go now?

45:37.068 --> 45:39.060
Hide there by that rock.

45:41.906 --> 45:43.340
Crouch there.

45:58.689 --> 46:00.920
Take off your pants.

46:00.958 --> 46:02.950
You can put them
back on later.

46:04.328 --> 46:06.297
Go on.

46:06.330 --> 46:09.391
- What are you doing?
- I have to stand up, don't I?

46:09.434 --> 46:11.426
Okay,
hand them over.

46:26.084 --> 46:27.677
Should I take off
anything else?

46:27.718 --> 46:29.687
No, it's okay.
Give them to me.

46:29.720 --> 46:30.915
Are you sure?

46:30.955 --> 46:33.823
Yeah.
Give me your pants.

46:33.858 --> 46:35.292
What about
my panties?

46:35.326 --> 46:37.693
No, I didn't say that.

49:16.487 --> 49:17.716
Hello?

52:41.759 --> 52:44.388
No, fuck!

52:54.738 --> 52:56.969
I need you to do
something.

52:57.007 --> 53:00.068
- I'll explain later.
- Why not now?

53:00.110 --> 53:02.511
It's not easy to explain.

53:39.049 --> 53:40.950
Hello!

55:34.698 --> 55:36.690
No, wait!

55:47.111 --> 55:50.047
Hey!
Please open the door!

55:50.080 --> 55:51.912
Listen to me a second!

55:51.949 --> 55:55.181
I was in the garden.
This is my house, you know?

55:55.219 --> 55:58.121
And suddenly I saw you
with my—I was far away.

55:58.155 --> 56:00.818
For God's sake,
don't call anybody!

56:00.858 --> 56:02.850
Hey!

56:24.014 --> 56:27.382
No, wait! Wait!

56:45.002 --> 56:46.265
Clara!

57:06.657 --> 57:08.387
See you later!

57:08.425 --> 57:11.327
- I'll leave them by the door.
- Okay.

57:50.200 --> 57:54.194
- It sounded like …
- I just heard a thunder. You mean that?

57:55.606 --> 57:58.303
Yeah. I think so.

57:58.342 --> 58:00.834
Okay, listen. Stay calm.

58:00.878 --> 58:04.371
I'm in another building.
I'll be right over. Stay there.

58:05.482 --> 58:07.474
Okay, thanks.

58:09.686 --> 58:11.985
- Hello?
- Yes?

58:12.022 --> 58:14.253
- This is Héctor 2.
- What?

58:14.291 --> 58:18.126
The second one. Keep your
voice down. Héctor might hear us.

58:18.162 --> 58:19.528
Okay, okay.

58:19.563 --> 58:22.863
He left the walkie-talkie
on the table in the basement.

58:22.900 --> 58:24.095
All right.

58:24.134 --> 58:27.229
I'm the one wearing
the bandage.

58:27.271 --> 58:28.933
Get him up to the silo.

58:28.972 --> 58:31.498
Make up something.
I'll show up in a car.

58:31.542 --> 58:33.477
- Make up something?
- Hello?

58:33.510 --> 58:35.069
- Yes?
- Did you say something?

58:37.281 --> 58:40.843
I have a question— is the man
after you wearing a bandage?

58:40.884 --> 58:42.876
Yeah, a pink one.

59:48.852 --> 59:51.412
He'll never think
to look for you in there.

59:54.958 --> 59:57.291
I have to lower
the hatch from here.

59:57.327 --> 59:59.455
I'll activate it
and get in with you.

01:00:14.978 --> 01:00:16.970
Come on!

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:22.442
Hey!

01:00:23.887 --> 01:00:26.083
Hey!

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:47.305
The man with the bandage,
the pink mummy!

01:00:48.445 --> 01:00:51.005
I admit it should have
occurred to me when …

01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:55.179
Come on.

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:59.649
Where are you going?

01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:02.717
To the house.
You need to be examined.

01:01:02.759 --> 01:01:06.992
You're the first vertebrate
to ever travel in time. Come on!

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:11.195
That bull about surveillance cameras
could have used more preparation …

01:01:12.703 --> 01:01:15.798
Surveillance cameras!
We could use some.

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:26.006
- What are you doing?
- I have to get back in!

01:01:26.049 --> 01:01:28.143
What?

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:29.744
Something went wrong.

01:01:29.786 --> 01:01:33.553
So you want to fix it now?
Forget it!

01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:35.354
- Listen to me!
- We'll talk at the house!

01:01:35.392 --> 01:01:37.486
- Come here!
- Forget it! No way!

01:01:43.266 --> 01:01:45.235
What are you doing?

01:01:47.738 --> 01:01:50.367
Come back
or I'll tear it apart.

01:01:51.575 --> 01:01:53.669
Go right ahead.

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:56.270
I'll wait for you
at the house.

01:02:25.675 --> 01:02:27.974
What are you doing,
trying to ruin me?

01:02:28.011 --> 01:02:30.674
After all I—

01:02:32.883 --> 01:02:36.342
What else has to happen
before you realize the implications?

01:02:36.386 --> 01:02:38.378
I have to do it.

01:02:46.063 --> 01:02:48.055
It's not going to happen.

01:02:49.132 --> 01:02:51.101
The tank won't work.

01:02:51.134 --> 01:02:52.397
Don't lie to me.

01:02:52.436 --> 01:02:54.564
Your trip used up
all the energy.

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:56.300
It's not easily
renewable.

01:02:56.339 --> 01:03:00.276
It'll have to be next week,
I don't know.

01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:01.505
Sorry.

01:03:06.416 --> 01:03:08.408
There was
something there.

01:03:09.686 --> 01:03:11.348
There was,
but it's not—

01:03:11.388 --> 01:03:14.051
- You took it out?
- No.

01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:21.788
Where is it?

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:25.602
I threw it away outside.

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:27.797
It's one
of the batteries.

01:03:27.838 --> 01:03:29.807
We can't do anything
without it.

01:03:57.467 --> 01:03:59.459
Come on.

01:04:01.905 --> 01:04:05.535
This machine
doesn't solve problems.

01:04:05.575 --> 01:04:07.203
In fact,
it creates them.

01:04:07.244 --> 01:04:09.907
I just need a head start
on the other two.

01:04:09.946 --> 01:04:11.915
I need a previous moment
to be able to …

01:04:11.948 --> 01:04:14.179
Look, I had
activated the machine

01:04:14.217 --> 01:04:16.118
seconds before
you appeared inside it.

01:04:16.153 --> 01:04:17.815
It was turned off
before that.

01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:20.255
You can't materialize
inside a machine if it's off.

01:04:20.290 --> 01:04:22.088
It's impossible.

01:04:22.125 --> 01:04:24.560
Seconds before?
How many seconds before?

01:04:24.594 --> 01:04:26.495
Maybe 30 or 40.

01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:28.431
You'd have a 30-to-40-second
head start.

01:04:28.465 --> 01:04:30.093
It's absurd.

01:04:30.133 --> 01:04:32.159
If you travel into the past

01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:35.536
and alter events, stopping
Héctor 1 from getting in the tank,

01:04:35.572 --> 01:04:38.770
there will be three of you
which will likely cause a chain reaction

01:04:38.808 --> 01:04:40.470
of events beyond
your control.

01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:42.308
I won't interfere.

01:04:42.345 --> 01:04:45.747
Héctor 2 will chase Héctor 1
into the tank, like he did before.

01:04:45.782 --> 01:04:47.648
My change won't
affect his plan.

01:04:47.684 --> 01:04:50.381
Then, there will be two of you—
you and Héctor 2.

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:52.218
Héctor 2 comes up here.

01:04:52.255 --> 01:04:54.053
I follow him
and finish him off.

01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:55.786
We'd be one again.

01:04:55.825 --> 01:04:57.919
You have no idea
what you're saying.

01:05:01.198 --> 01:05:02.962
Hold on.

01:05:02.999 --> 01:05:06.197
Why did you throw
that thing away?

01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:09.695
I can't let you use
the machine again. I'm sorry, I …

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:12.072
No, what I mean is …

01:05:12.108 --> 01:05:16.273
You took out the battery
before I said anything, right?

01:05:16.313 --> 01:05:18.782
Well, yeah.

01:05:18.815 --> 01:05:21.649
Before I showed up.

01:05:21.685 --> 01:05:24.348
Because I imagined …

01:05:25.689 --> 01:05:27.988
One moment.

01:05:31.194 --> 01:05:34.631
How did you know I'd want
to use the machine again?

01:05:35.732 --> 01:05:38.292
You knew it all along.

01:05:38.335 --> 01:05:40.304
Are you tricking me again?

01:05:40.337 --> 01:05:43.136
You're tricking me again.

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:52.416
Tell me.

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:55.044
Please don't
make matters worse.

01:05:55.085 --> 01:05:57.520
You knew
what would happen.

01:06:01.424 --> 01:06:03.723
Why?

01:06:05.128 --> 01:06:06.994
Because Héctor 3
told me.

01:06:10.634 --> 01:06:12.796
Héctor 3?

01:06:14.571 --> 01:06:16.972
Héctor 3—
the third one.

01:06:19.242 --> 01:06:22.041
You're kidding me.

01:06:27.651 --> 01:06:30.052
You weren't the first
to appear in the tank.

01:06:31.888 --> 01:06:34.323
You were the second.

01:06:34.357 --> 01:06:37.122
The first
had appeared earlier.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:39.459
He had threatened me.

01:06:39.496 --> 01:06:42.227
He made me act
surprised to see you.

01:06:42.265 --> 01:06:44.894
He made me go along
with it.

01:06:44.934 --> 01:06:46.835
He appeared earlier?

01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:49.339
How much earlier?

01:06:51.274 --> 01:06:53.004
30 to 40 seconds.

01:06:53.043 --> 01:06:54.705
But—

01:06:54.744 --> 01:06:57.009
He left
right after you.

01:06:57.047 --> 01:06:58.879
I never found out
what he wanted.

01:06:58.915 --> 01:07:01.783
You've been deceiving me
the whole time.

01:07:03.586 --> 01:07:06.647
After leaving
the two of you,

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:08.659
I went up to the silo to prepare
for Héctor 1's arrival

01:07:08.692 --> 01:07:10.991
when suddenly I got a buzz
on the walkie-talkie.

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:13.997
It was Héctor 1
calling from the house.

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:17.728
No, much earlier.
It was daytime. It was Héctor 3.

01:07:17.767 --> 01:07:19.565
Hello?

01:07:19.602 --> 01:07:22.697
- This is Héctor 3.
- Who?

01:07:22.739 --> 01:07:25.334
The last one.
Listen to me.

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:27.708
I'm very sorry.

01:07:27.744 --> 01:07:29.406
What happened?

01:07:29.446 --> 01:07:33.508
I'm afraid everyone
will know what we did.

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:36.315
He seemed out of it,
like something horrible had happened.

01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:39.384
He told me everything
that would happen—

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:42.723
that you'd
show up here,

01:07:42.759 --> 01:07:45.228
trying to go
back to the past.

01:07:46.629 --> 01:07:49.997
He didn't say why, but he said
to stop you at all costs.

01:07:56.239 --> 01:08:00.734
You'll be Héctor 3 if you go through
with it. What I say won't stop you.

01:08:00.777 --> 01:08:03.246
Happy?

01:08:03.279 --> 01:08:05.748
Wait a minute.

01:08:05.782 --> 01:08:09.651
You mean the second trip
I'm about to take was already made?

01:08:09.686 --> 01:08:12.781
Apparently, you couldn't solve
your little problem.

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:16.448
You told me yourself
it failed.

01:08:18.962 --> 01:08:21.158
It makes no sense.

01:08:21.197 --> 01:08:23.256
Wait a minute.

01:08:23.299 --> 01:08:25.962
You say Héctor 3 called you
from his walkie-talkie.

01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:28.233
Yeah.

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:30.934
You mean …

01:08:30.974 --> 01:08:33.136
from this one.

01:08:33.176 --> 01:08:35.167
Yeah.

01:08:40.316 --> 01:08:42.341
Shine
the light on it.

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:45.389
Over there!

01:08:57.167 --> 01:08:59.158
I think this is yours.

01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:02.203
All I ask is,
please think it over.

01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:16.045
Héctor,
what happened?

01:09:17.554 --> 01:09:18.988
I have no choice.

01:11:06.462 --> 01:11:08.294
Calm down
and listen to me.

01:11:08.331 --> 01:11:10.493
I'm from the future.
Your machine works.

01:11:10.533 --> 01:11:12.365
- Where—?
- Listen to me.

01:11:12.402 --> 01:11:14.371
- How—?
- Listen to me!

01:11:14.404 --> 01:11:16.396
Or everyone will
know you turned it on

01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:18.135
without authorization.

01:11:18.174 --> 01:11:19.938
Right now there are
three of me.

01:11:19.976 --> 01:11:23.310
You're going to help me
get rid of the other two.

01:11:23.346 --> 01:11:25.679
Héctor 2 is about
to come out of the tank.

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:27.843
Help him get Héctor 1
into the tank.

01:11:29.319 --> 01:11:30.685
Héctor 2?
But …

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.052
He'll explain it
to you.

01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:35.586
- But—
- Stand there.

01:12:18.067 --> 01:12:20.059
Calm him down.

01:12:20.103 --> 01:12:22.299
I have to reach the house
before all of you.

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.836
Make sure
he doesn't see me.

01:12:25.875 --> 01:12:28.504
I have to get rid of him, you got it?
Calm him down.

01:12:28.544 --> 01:12:30.536
Ask him who he is.

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:34.412
- But who's Héctor 1?
- Go!

01:13:57.166 --> 01:13:58.896
Shit, you're here!

01:13:58.935 --> 01:14:00.733
Keep it down,
he might hear you.

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:02.739
I need a remote
for the gate.

01:14:02.772 --> 01:14:05.901
- In the desk …
- Not for the white car—the others.

01:14:05.942 --> 01:14:07.410
There aren't
any others.

01:14:07.443 --> 01:14:09.344
Then another car.

01:14:09.378 --> 01:14:11.370
There's a truck.

01:14:14.517 --> 01:14:16.486
The deal's
still on, right?

01:14:16.519 --> 01:14:18.920
When you get rid of them,
you won't say anything, right?

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:24.988
- I told him—
- I know, but he won't listen.

01:14:25.027 --> 01:14:27.019
He'll leave
at some point.

01:14:27.063 --> 01:14:29.055
What are you
going to do?

01:14:34.737 --> 01:14:36.729
Go after him.

01:17:08.791 --> 01:17:12.888
Hello?

01:17:19.969 --> 01:17:22.700
- This is Héctor 3.
- Who?

01:17:22.738 --> 01:17:25.640
The last one.
Listen to me.

01:17:28.544 --> 01:17:31.571
- I'm very sorry.
- What happened?

01:17:31.614 --> 01:17:34.174
I'm afraid everyone
will know what we did.

01:17:36.385 --> 01:17:40.049
Looks like you bet
on the wrong horse.

01:17:40.089 --> 01:17:42.684
I'm a failure.

01:17:42.725 --> 01:17:45.024
Héctor.

01:17:45.061 --> 01:17:46.825
Héctor?

01:17:46.862 --> 01:17:48.626
Where are you?
Héctor?

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:51.156
Why did you have
to turn on the machine?

01:17:53.269 --> 01:17:55.670
I don't know.

01:17:55.705 --> 01:17:58.539
They won't turn it on
for another six months.

01:17:58.574 --> 01:18:02.306
I won't be authorized
to be there. I guess …

01:18:02.345 --> 01:18:04.837
You wanted to take a closer look
beforehand, right?

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:09.785
If you want to keep your job
and your life as you know it,

01:18:09.819 --> 01:18:13.153
keep the guy with the bandage out
of the tank at all costs.

01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:15.488
Why?

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:19.291
At least that way somebody
will be there to smack you.

01:18:38.014 --> 01:18:40.074
What happened?

01:18:41.751 --> 01:18:44.915
I think we're both running
from the same person.

01:18:44.954 --> 01:18:46.616
He won't find us here.

01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:55.763
- His face is bandaged.
- Yeah.

01:18:55.798 --> 01:18:58.267
He's up there.

01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:03.365
- He won't come down here.
- Have you got a telephone?

01:19:03.406 --> 01:19:06.137
No, sit here.

01:19:19.321 --> 01:19:21.552
Wake up!

01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:24.788
There's a house nearby.

01:19:26.762 --> 01:19:28.321
Can you get up?

01:19:42.578 --> 01:19:44.604
There it is.

01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:56.092
Come on.

01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:58.720
No, we shouldn't go
in that house.

01:19:58.761 --> 01:20:00.787
Careful.

01:20:12.007 --> 01:20:13.999
Hello?

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:38.267
Wait here,
I'll go check.

01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:19.205
Héctor!

01:21:21.911 --> 01:21:24.904
What happened to you?

01:21:24.947 --> 01:21:27.542
Nothing.

01:21:27.583 --> 01:21:29.609
There's someone outside—

01:21:29.652 --> 01:21:32.417
across the garden.
He broke the fence—

01:21:32.454 --> 01:21:35.618
a man with his face
covered.

01:21:35.658 --> 01:21:37.684
I ran down here to hide

01:21:37.726 --> 01:21:41.527
and I heard someone
on the stairs.

01:21:41.564 --> 01:21:43.430
There's somebody
in the house.

01:21:43.465 --> 01:21:45.832
I called the police.

01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:54.777
- What's wrong?
- My God.

01:21:54.810 --> 01:21:58.076
Hello?

01:21:58.113 --> 01:21:59.741
Who is that?

01:21:59.782 --> 01:22:01.580
Shh.

01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:06.616
Come with me.

01:22:42.658 --> 01:22:44.286
Héctor …

01:22:44.326 --> 01:22:46.693
Hide in there
until I say.

01:22:46.729 --> 01:22:48.197
Tell me what's
happening!

01:22:48.230 --> 01:22:51.132
No matter what you hear,
don't come out.

01:22:51.166 --> 01:22:53.192
Don't interfere.

01:22:53.235 --> 01:22:55.227
Please!

01:24:08.811 --> 01:24:11.940
Shh! Listen.

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:13.972
That guy is crazy.

01:24:20.556 --> 01:24:24.891
He saw you from far away
and went nuts.

01:24:24.927 --> 01:24:27.226
You have to hide from him.

01:24:29.965 --> 01:24:31.934
You have to fool him.

01:24:42.311 --> 01:24:44.303
Come on.

01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:58.651
There's
an attic upstairs.

01:24:58.694 --> 01:25:00.925
When I say "now,"
run upstairs

01:25:00.963 --> 01:25:03.296
and lock the door
behind you.

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:13.875
You're beautiful.

01:25:19.281 --> 01:25:21.273
Now.

01:25:26.255 --> 01:25:29.123
No, wait!

01:25:34.163 --> 01:25:36.689
Hey! Please open
the door!

01:25:36.732 --> 01:25:38.394
Listen to me a second!

01:25:38.434 --> 01:25:41.529
I was in the garden.
This is my house, you know?

01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:44.631
And suddenly I saw you with my—
I was far away.

01:25:44.673 --> 01:25:46.335
For God's sake,
don't call anybody!

01:26:07.162 --> 01:26:10.621
What happened?
Héctor, what's going on?

01:27:04.953 --> 01:27:08.583
No! Wait! Wait!

01:27:10.259 --> 01:27:13.388
Please relax.

01:27:27.242 --> 01:27:29.438
- Héctor …
- It's okay.

01:27:36.952 --> 01:27:39.888
We still have a while before
it starts raining.
