00:01.260 --> 00:04.559
Previously on Elementary...
You remember Kitty.

00:04.600 --> 00:07.489
Kitty, oh, my God.
What are you doing here?

00:07.540 --> 00:09.462
It's not Margaret
I wanted you to meet.

00:10.710 --> 00:13.304
This is Archie, my son.

00:13.340 --> 00:14.409
KI'I'I'Y: His name's
Eli Kotite.

00:14.440 --> 00:15.532
About three and
a half years ago,

00:15.580 --> 00:18.572
he struck a jogger with his car
and then fled the scene.

00:18.610 --> 00:20.771
The barrister
who defended him

00:20.820 --> 00:21.775
committed suicide.

00:21.820 --> 00:23.640
Couple of weeks later,

00:23.690 --> 00:25.646
the magistrate who
presided over the trial

00:25.690 --> 00:27.783
was killed in a car accident.

00:27.820 --> 00:28.787
HOLMES:
Then, three days ago,

00:28.820 --> 00:30.526
Cy Durning, who prosecuted him,

00:30.560 --> 00:33.529
dropped dead of an apparent
heart attack in New Jersey.

00:33.560 --> 00:35.653
You think that this guy Kotite
killed three people

00:35.700 --> 00:38.396
and then managed to make it look
like something else each time?

00:38.430 --> 00:40.796
After we prove Kotite's
guilty, I'm quitting.

00:40.840 --> 00:43.468
I just don't know how
Sherlock's gonna take it.

00:43.510 --> 00:45.603
I had nothing to do
with those murders.

00:45.640 --> 00:47.198
You agree the deaths
were not divine providence?

00:47.240 --> 00:48.138
I do.

00:48.180 --> 00:50.341
I think I may even know
who's behind them.

00:50.380 --> 00:53.816
I'm Anson Gephardt. I work for
the Defense Intelligence Agency.

00:53.850 --> 00:56.114
I'm here to place you
under arrest.

00:57.450 --> 00:59.452
(footsteps approaching)

01:02.190 --> 01:03.521
(door opens)

01:07.530 --> 01:10.590
Your clock's broken,
Mr. Gephardt.

01:10.630 --> 01:14.464
That is what I'm supposed
to call you, isn't it?

01:14.500 --> 01:16.161
It is my name.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.734
Well, you work for
Defense Intelligence.

01:17.770 --> 01:21.308
I-I just thought that, um,
an agency that makes

01:21.340 --> 01:23.399
the CIA look like
the model of transparency

01:23.450 --> 01:25.099
might've furnished you
with an alias.

01:25.150 --> 01:26.469
Mm. Once upon a time.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.317
I'm just an analyst now.

01:28.350 --> 01:30.784
You're guilty of at least
two murders here in the States,

01:30.820 --> 01:33.482
and I think you might be
responsible for two in London.

01:35.190 --> 01:36.487
All of your victims
are connected

01:36.530 --> 01:40.352
to the 2014 trial of Eli Kotite.

01:40.400 --> 01:43.460
So, why-why kill them now?

01:43.500 --> 01:45.525
Take a look around, Mr. Holmes.

01:45.570 --> 01:47.128
Anything jump out?

01:47.170 --> 01:50.333
Well, as I mentioned,
there's the clock.

01:50.370 --> 01:52.600
It ticks off a full
hour every 44 minutes.

01:52.640 --> 01:53.834
Sitting here

01:53.880 --> 01:55.677
in the precise center
of the room

01:55.710 --> 01:57.405
means all of my words echo.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.145
The corners in the floors
have been painted

01:59.180 --> 02:00.772
in such a way
as to warp perspective,

02:00.820 --> 02:02.378
and this water-- it's clean,

02:02.420 --> 02:05.344
but a benign,
bitter flavorant has been added

02:05.390 --> 02:08.484
to provoke paranoia.

02:08.520 --> 02:11.648
You're every bit
as perceptive as they say.

02:11.690 --> 02:14.193
So I wonder,

02:14.230 --> 02:16.892
do you really think
you're here to question me?

02:16.930 --> 02:19.660
Force of habit,
interrogating murderers.

02:19.700 --> 02:21.236
You know what they say.

02:21.270 --> 02:23.363
The best defense
is a good offense.

02:23.410 --> 02:27.631
Only there is no defense
for what I could do to you.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.500
Getting that idea

02:29.550 --> 02:33.270
into that big brain of yours,
that's why you're here.

02:33.320 --> 02:36.289
Is that true, gentlemen?

02:36.320 --> 02:39.551
You've given your man
carte blanche to...

02:39.590 --> 02:42.525
See? Nobody's watching.

02:42.560 --> 02:44.357
Nobody's listening either.

02:44.390 --> 02:47.518
You can trust me on that
because If they were,

02:47.560 --> 02:49.391
I probably wouldn't admit to you

02:49.430 --> 02:52.365
that you're exactly right
about what I've done.

02:52.400 --> 02:54.265
But as I was saying,

02:54.300 --> 02:56.666
I didn't bring you here
to kill you.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.701
Well, I'd really like
to get going,

03:01.340 --> 03:02.739
Your investigation

03:02.780 --> 03:05.669
into the Kotite murders,
it's got to stop.

03:05.710 --> 03:08.713
You're meddling in matters
of national security.

03:08.750 --> 03:10.741
You'll have to be
a little more speCIfIc.

03:10.790 --> 03:12.883
At least four people
have been murdered,

03:12.920 --> 03:14.854
and I'm not one
for vague assurances

03:14.890 --> 03:16.926
from the intelligence community.

03:16.960 --> 03:18.655
Hmm.

03:18.690 --> 03:21.329
Well, you'll make
an exception this time.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.669
Or I can be number five?

03:23.700 --> 03:26.362
I don't make unnecessary bodies.

03:26.400 --> 03:30.860
In your case, I can just
walk into a FISA court.

03:30.910 --> 03:33.003
You'll tie me to my father.

03:33.040 --> 03:34.701
Mm-hmm.

03:34.740 --> 03:36.674
Morland Holmes is a busy man.

03:36.710 --> 03:39.315
Smuggling uranium ore
out of Kazakhstan,

03:39.350 --> 03:40.647
bribing regulators
in Manila.

03:40.680 --> 03:42.238
Recently, he's taken
some sort of interest

03:42.290 --> 03:44.383
in the Hans Tausen ice cap.

03:44.420 --> 03:47.014
I doubt you know
any of his business.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.858
But that doesn't mean you can't
be made a permanent guest

03:49.890 --> 03:52.552
in one of our ___
less comfortable faculties.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.524
And you can rest assured,
the playbook there goes

03:55.560 --> 03:59.894
quite a bit further than
scented water and echoes.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.704
Well, that's it, then.

04:02.740 --> 04:04.731
You're not gonna answer
for your crimes.

04:04.770 --> 04:08.536
The past is past, Mr. Holmes.

04:08.580 --> 04:12.641
I'd urge you
to think about your future.

04:15.480 --> 04:16.788
(door opens)

04:22.790 --> 04:24.485
(phone chimes)

04:27.060 --> 04:28.857
(tires screeching)

04:32.400 --> 04:33.594
(grunts)

04:33.640 --> 04:35.039
(tires screeching)

04:35.070 --> 04:36.298
Are you okay?

04:36.340 --> 04:37.739
Uh, yeah.

04:37.770 --> 04:40.000
I'm, uh, I'm famished
and I'm parched,

04:40.040 --> 04:41.974
and I need the facilities
In the worst way.

04:42.010 --> 04:44.570
But you got
all your fingernails.

04:44.610 --> 04:46.510
I take it you and Kitty
weren't rumbled?

04:46.550 --> 04:48.575
No, I checked her and the baby
into a hotel last night.

04:48.620 --> 04:50.315
Nobody came for us.
So what happened last night?

04:50.350 --> 04:51.886
I mean, who the hell snatches
someone from their home

04:51.920 --> 04:53.785
and then just dumps them
in broad daylight like this?

04:53.820 --> 04:55.356
Agents of
the American government.

04:55.390 --> 04:57.381
But you'll be pleased to hear
all but one of them

04:57.430 --> 04:58.920
were acting in good faith
on bad information.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.655
Up until now,

05:00.700 --> 05:02.918
I hadn't been hurt at all
during this ordeal.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.722
Could you just gnaw it off?

05:04.770 --> 05:07.466
(grunts) Okay.
So you said "all but one"?

05:07.500 --> 05:09.661
I met our killer.
His name is Anson Gephardt,

05:09.710 --> 05:10.938
and apparently he's quite senior

05:10.970 --> 05:12.062
at the Defense
Intelligence Agency.

05:12.110 --> 05:15.932
You think he's guilty
because he matches your sketch?

05:15.980 --> 05:17.948
I think he's guilty because
he confessed to the murders.

05:17.980 --> 05:20.073
_ He also said
that If we continue to press,

05:20.120 --> 05:22.418
he will link me
to my father's latest misdeeds,

05:22.450 --> 05:23.883
amongst other degradations.

05:23.920 --> 05:25.683
So now what?

05:25.720 --> 05:26.982
An American spy
has a murderous obsession

05:27.020 --> 05:28.749
with a three-year-old
vehicular homicide

05:28.790 --> 05:30.985
which took place in London;
so after I use the toilet,

05:31.030 --> 05:32.349
I'm going to ignore
his instructions,

05:32.400 --> 05:33.594
and I'm gonna find out why.

05:36.870 --> 05:37.859
*

05:43.040 --> 05:45.099
(dog barking '805 pop song)

05:53.650 --> 05:55.948
Watson?

05:55.980 --> 05:57.516
Watson, I got your text!

05:57.550 --> 05:59.552
Hey.

05:59.590 --> 06:02.423
Either your taste in music
has really changed,

06:02.460 --> 06:04.519
or you think
this place is bugged.

06:04.560 --> 06:06.653
I just finished my second sweep.

06:06.700 --> 06:07.951
And?

06:08.000 --> 06:09.058
It's all clear.

06:09.100 --> 06:10.419
(music stops)

06:10.470 --> 06:13.439
Made this himself, did he?

06:13.470 --> 06:15.097
Can you believe
that's volume three of six?

06:15.140 --> 06:17.108
Right. Now that you're sure
no one's listening,

06:17.140 --> 06:19.631
do you want to tell me
why the US. government

06:19.680 --> 06:21.807
declared war on you last night?

06:21.840 --> 06:23.944
KITTY: I don't get it.
What does an American

06:23.980 --> 06:25.902
intelligence officer
care about

06:25.950 --> 06:28.111
a British vehicular manslaughter
case from three years ago?

06:28.150 --> 06:29.845
Why kill four people over it?

06:29.890 --> 06:32.017
Well, that's what Sherlock
is trying to figure out.

06:32.050 --> 06:34.154
He went down to the
precmct a few hours ago,

06:34.190 --> 06:35.714
just in case our
walls had ears.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.159
Unfortunately, we
have not been able

06:37.190 --> 06:39.693
to find out a lot
about Anson Gephardt,

06:39.730 --> 06:41.925
except that he is a Middle
Eastern affairs analyst

06:41.960 --> 06:43.962
and has strong
feelings about Iran.

06:44.000 --> 06:44.967
Good ones or bad?

06:45.000 --> 06:46.831
We were able to track down

06:46.870 --> 06:48.997
an intelligence report he wrote.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.008
He called their government--
and I'm quoting here--

06:51.040 --> 06:53.600
"The most evil regime
in existence."

06:53.640 --> 06:55.039
Bad,then.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.968
Oh, we didn't get
to talk last night

06:57.010 --> 06:59.547
about Sherlock meeting
Archie. How'd it go?

06:59.580 --> 07:02.071
We were interrupted
when Eli Kotite called.

07:02.120 --> 07:04.213
Sherlock left to meet him
straightaway.

07:04.250 --> 07:06.855
So you didn't get to tell him
you were quitting.

07:06.890 --> 07:08.858
That's okay. I mean,
there's no rush, right?

07:08.890 --> 07:10.858
What did Sherlock think
about Archie?

07:10.890 --> 07:12.152
He didn't say.

07:12.190 --> 07:13.851
But he looked
like I'd just brought

07:13.900 --> 07:15.629
a ten-pound spider
into his home.

07:15.660 --> 07:16.490
Come on.

07:16.530 --> 07:18.589
Ten-pound spider, Watson.

07:18.630 --> 07:20.598
Look, Sherlock
is a grouch, okay?

07:20.640 --> 07:21.993
Nobody knows that
better than me.

07:22.040 --> 07:24.463
You were nervous
about telling hIm

07:24.510 --> 07:25.863
about everything else,
so you read into it.

07:25.910 --> 07:27.138
Of course he's happy for you.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.102
Well, I'm gonna
take your word on that,

07:29.140 --> 07:31.574
because Archie and Margaret
and I suddenly find ourselves

07:31.610 --> 07:33.146
in need of a place to stay.

07:33.180 --> 07:34.738
The owners
of the house I rented

07:34.780 --> 07:36.589
saw the damage
that you and Margaret did.

07:36.620 --> 07:37.609
They want us out.

07:37.650 --> 07:38.719
(phone chimes)

07:38.750 --> 07:40.058
It's Sherlock.

07:40.090 --> 07:42.479
He wants us to meet
him at the precinct.

07:45.790 --> 07:47.257
I've got good news.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.528
KITTY:
Do tell.

07:48.560 --> 07:51.927
After a thorough reexamination
of Eli Kotite's London trial,

07:51.970 --> 07:53.130
there were no surprises;
everything was exactly

07:53.170 --> 07:54.489
as you and I
thought it was

07:54.540 --> 07:56.508
three years ago.

07:56.540 --> 07:59.668
An American civilian struck
a British civilian with his car.

07:59.710 --> 08:02.543
We did not accidentally send
an innocent man to prison

08:02.580 --> 08:04.798
for a crime which was really
committed by the DIA.

08:04.850 --> 08:06.772
Also, as far as
I was able to discern,

08:06.820 --> 08:08.674
none of the recent _
murder Victims have any ties

08:08.720 --> 08:11.109
to the DIA or any similar groups
around the globe.

08:11.150 --> 08:15.018
So, in other words,
you don't have anything.

08:15.060 --> 08:17.153
No. I have a theory.

08:17.190 --> 08:19.021
Neither the facts
of Kotite's case

08:19.060 --> 08:21.927
nor the outcome of_his trial
seem to be a motivating factor

08:21.960 --> 08:23.166
in the deaths here

08:23.200 --> 08:24.792
or in London.

08:24.830 --> 08:25.990
So what remains?

08:26.030 --> 08:27.167
The players.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.599
The magistrate, the defendant,

08:28.640 --> 08:30.301
the defense attorney,
the prosecutor.

08:30.340 --> 08:32.900
The time they spent
together in a London court.

08:32.940 --> 08:35.534
What if something occurred over
the course of Kotite's trial

08:35.580 --> 08:36.945
which made them all witnesses?

08:36.980 --> 08:39.107
Something unrelated
to Kotite's prosecution,

08:39.150 --> 08:40.947
but very related
to the activities

08:40.980 --> 08:43.039
of a clandestine group
like the DIA?

08:43.090 --> 08:44.887
Like what?

08:44.920 --> 08:46.717
Perhaps they were all
in the same corridor

08:46.760 --> 08:48.853
when an operative paid off
a magistrate in another trial.

08:48.890 --> 08:50.881
Perhaps the agency committed
one of their murders

08:50.930 --> 08:52.921
that don't look like murders
under everyone's noses.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.097
The possibilities,
I'm afraid,

08:54.130 --> 08:55.722
are endless.

08:55.760 --> 08:57.796
But the gist is this:
Kotite and the others

08:57.830 --> 08:59.695
were in the wrong place
at the wrong time,

08:59.740 --> 09:01.594
seeing or hearing something
which, three years hence,

09:01.640 --> 09:03.301
required their assassinations.

09:03.340 --> 09:05.900
Okay, so, short of building
a time machine,

09:05.940 --> 09:08.329
how do we figure out
what that something might be?

09:08.380 --> 09:09.972
I've reached out to some friends
at Scotland Yard,

09:10.010 --> 09:12.103
asked them to dig up records
of what was going on

09:12.150 --> 09:14.243
in and around the court
at the time of Kotite's trial.

09:14.280 --> 09:15.918
In the meantime,
I suggest we approach

09:15.950 --> 09:17.247
one of the two local parties

09:17.290 --> 09:19.246
which might be able
to shed some light.

09:19.290 --> 09:22.259
I'm guessing Cy Durning's widow
is one of them. Who's the other?

09:22.290 --> 09:24.929
Farrell & Putnam, the so-called
"Death Star" law firm

09:24.960 --> 09:27.258
which Kotite hired
to defend him.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.790
They've got offices
all over the world,

09:28.830 --> 09:29.865
including here
in New York.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.367
So, while I pop in on them,

09:31.400 --> 09:33.994
you and Kitty go and visit
the widow Durning.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.860
This is her address.

09:35.900 --> 09:37.561
Why don't you take Kitty?

09:38.770 --> 09:41.307
I know you two have
a lot to catch up on.

09:44.010 --> 09:46.171
(door closes)

09:48.750 --> 09:50.889
KITTY: I'm surprised
we got a meeting

09:50.920 --> 09:52.751
with the managing partner
so easily.

09:52.790 --> 09:54.155
Well, I didn't
identify myself

09:54.190 --> 09:56.078
as Sherlock Holmes,
consulting detective,

09:56.120 --> 09:59.385
but rather Sherlock Holmes,
son of Morland.

09:59.430 --> 10:03.628
He and a firm like this could do
great, evil things together.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.290
About last night...

10:09.340 --> 10:10.637
He is beautiful.

10:10.670 --> 10:12.069
Your son.

10:13.910 --> 10:16.174
Archibald.

10:16.210 --> 10:18.906
Very happy for you.

10:18.950 --> 10:20.372
Thank you.

10:20.420 --> 10:21.910
I suppose you'll
be getting out

10:21.950 --> 10:23.383
of the detecting game.

10:23.420 --> 10:28.153
I'd ask you how you knew that,
but you're you.

10:28.190 --> 10:30.055
You wouldn't be the first person
to shift priorities

10:30.090 --> 10:31.318
after parenthood.

10:31.360 --> 10:35.057
Y-You're not disappointed?

10:35.100 --> 10:37.022
Do I look disappointed?

10:37.070 --> 10:38.992
No.

10:39.030 --> 10:41.066
No, you look angry.

10:41.100 --> 10:42.761
RECEPTIONIST:
Mr. Holmes?

10:42.810 --> 10:44.232
Mr. Garber will
see you now.

10:46.240 --> 10:48.128
GARBER:
So, if I'm following you,

10:48.180 --> 10:52.344
you think four people connected
to Eli Kotite's trial in London,

10:52.380 --> 10:54.143
including
Mr. Kotite himself,

10:54.180 --> 10:56.410
have been murdered
by a government agency?

10:56.450 --> 10:59.010
Well, when you put it like that,
it does sound quite mad.

10:59.050 --> 11:00.813
Is there any other way
to put it?

11:00.860 --> 11:02.680
No, there isn't.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.220
I'm sorry.

11:04.260 --> 11:06.421
There's no way I can give you
the files you're looking for.

11:06.460 --> 11:08.826
Anything and everything
we have that pertains

11:08.860 --> 11:10.225
to Mr. Kotite's trial

11:10.270 --> 11:12.090
is protected
by attorney-client privilege.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.234
He's dead now,
as is the man who defended him,

11:14.270 --> 11:17.364
Tom Saunders-- your colleague,
your partner at this firm.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.002
Two months ago,
his daughter found him

11:19.040 --> 11:20.371
in his kitchen in Mayfair

11:20.410 --> 11:23.243
with a gun in his hand
and his brains on the wall.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.703
Now, if we're right and
someone else pulled the trigger,

11:25.750 --> 11:27.968
don't you want to see
justice done on his behalf?

11:28.020 --> 11:29.885
Tom Saunders was
a hell of a lot more

11:29.920 --> 11:32.115
than my colleague, okay?
He was my friend.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.459
But this theory of yours,
you don't have any proof.

11:34.490 --> 11:36.253
You don't find it
the least bit odd

11:36.290 --> 11:38.155
that someone dug up
one of the victim's bodies

11:38.190 --> 11:39.896
and set fire to it
the other day?

11:39.930 --> 11:42.057
Actually,
I find it incredibly odd.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.727
Then give us the files we want.

11:43.770 --> 11:46.159
I swear to God,

11:46.200 --> 11:48.998
if Tom weren't dead, I'd think
he came up with all this.

11:49.040 --> 11:50.735
Now, what do you mean by that?

11:50.770 --> 11:54.035
He was a paranoid schizophrenic.

11:55.240 --> 11:58.004
That didn't come up
in any of our research.

11:58.050 --> 11:58.903
Well, of course it didn't.

11:58.950 --> 12:00.815
It was a best kept secret
at the firm.

12:02.820 --> 12:04.788
the finest legal minds
on the planet.

12:04.820 --> 12:06.287
When he was off them...

12:06.320 --> 12:09.153
well, let's just say
he was prone to outbursts.

12:09.190 --> 12:10.521
What kind of outbursts?

12:10.560 --> 12:11.652
Ranting, raving.

12:11.690 --> 12:14.056
"The Russians are talking to me
through my television."

12:14.100 --> 12:15.897
That sort of thing.

12:15.930 --> 12:18.467
I'm telling you, when he wasn't
taking care of himself,

12:18.500 --> 12:20.036
he was capable of anything.

12:20.070 --> 12:22.038
Including putting
a gun in his mouth

12:22.070 --> 12:23.867
and pulling the trigger.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.434
KATE DURNING:
Sorry.

12:25.470 --> 12:28.769
I want to be helpful,
but Cy prosecuted so many cases.

12:28.810 --> 12:30.801
The Kotite trial was big.

12:30.850 --> 12:32.408
People in England
followed it very closely.

12:32.450 --> 12:33.769
And while that was them,

12:33.820 --> 12:35.447
Cy was Cy.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.880
He didn't like to bring
his work home with him.

12:37.920 --> 12:41.481
Well, did he ever mention
anything out of the ordinary?

12:41.520 --> 12:44.978
(sighs) To the best
of my recollection, no.

12:45.030 --> 12:47.191
But remember, Cy was British.

12:47.230 --> 12:49.926
A pack of wild dogs could've run
right through the courtroom,

12:49.970 --> 12:51.858
and he might've kept it
to himself.

12:53.900 --> 12:56.198
You said you think
he might have been killed

12:56.240 --> 12:57.935
because of something
he saw or heard

12:57.970 --> 12:59.107
around the courthouse back then.

12:59.140 --> 13:00.937
Mm-hmm.

13:00.980 --> 13:04.575
Whatever it was, do you think
it might have happened

13:04.610 --> 13:06.248
during the trial itself?

13:06.280 --> 13:09.113
Uh, the proceedings, I mean.
Inside the courtroom.

13:09.150 --> 13:11.482
Sure, it's possible.

13:13.020 --> 13:15.511
There's something
you should see.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.949
A few years ago, when Cy and I
first started talking

13:17.990 --> 13:20.925
about retirement-- please--
he was apprehensive.

13:20.960 --> 13:22.359
He knew it was
the right time,

13:22.400 --> 13:24.925
but he was worried
that he'd go stir-crazy.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.460
So he decided
to write a book.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.229
Cut to the big day.

13:28.270 --> 13:30.261
He hangs up his wig,
moves to New Jersey,

13:30.310 --> 13:32.403
we settle in here,
and to his utter shock,

13:32.440 --> 13:33.600
he likes retirement.

13:33.640 --> 13:35.938
Whole book thing falls away.

13:35.980 --> 13:39.143
It was gonna be a "how to" about
opening and closing arguments.

13:39.180 --> 13:42.980
Composing the right one
for the right jury,

13:43.020 --> 13:45.215
delivering it effectively.

13:45.250 --> 13:47.013
He wanted to write
from experience.

13:47.060 --> 13:49.984
So, in his last few years
as a prosecutor,

13:50.030 --> 13:52.851
he started recording
all of his court appearances

13:52.900 --> 13:54.629
on microcassette.

13:54.660 --> 13:56.628
It's not entirely legal,

13:56.660 --> 13:58.560
in case you're wondering.

13:58.600 --> 14:03.503
These are the tapes of
his prosecution of Eli Kotite.

14:03.540 --> 14:05.428
Would you like
to listen to them?

14:09.640 --> 14:12.108
(Margaret speaking German)

14:15.650 --> 14:17.288
Oh.

14:17.320 --> 14:19.538
Ithink... Ithink

14:19.590 --> 14:21.148
this one is dead.

14:21.190 --> 14:23.021
KITTY: Actually,
they're all dead.

14:23.060 --> 14:25.620
Sherlock uses that
to recreate crime scenes.

14:25.660 --> 14:28.652
This one Archie's playing with
drowned in the bathtub.

14:28.700 --> 14:29.655
And this one

14:29.700 --> 14:31.327
_in the kitchen_
dined on arsenic.

14:31.370 --> 14:34.464
That mess on the floor
is doll vomit.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.036
Hey.

14:36.070 --> 14:37.298
(door closes)

14:37.340 --> 14:38.466
Where's Sherlock?

14:38.510 --> 14:39.568
KITTY: He's gone back
to the precinct

14:39.610 --> 14:41.032
to get what
he's working on.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.536
Is there something wrong?
(toy cranking)

14:42.580 --> 14:44.445
Where did you get that from?

14:44.480 --> 14:47.278
A trunk in the guest room. Why?

14:47.320 --> 14:49.345
No reason.

14:49.380 --> 14:51.211
There's just, like,
a 50/50 chance

14:51.250 --> 14:52.615
that's a Victorian sex toy.

14:54.260 --> 14:55.386
Ooh, ooh.

14:55.420 --> 14:57.251
Come on,
you've got to hear this.

14:59.690 --> 15:02.124
So the next voice you're
gonna hear is Tom Saunders.

15:02.160 --> 15:04.321
He's the attorney
who defended E|i Kotite.

15:04.370 --> 15:05.598
TOM SAUNDERS:
No. I object, My Lord.

15:05.630 --> 15:07.268
MAGISTRATE:
To what, Mr. Saunders?

15:07.300 --> 15:08.938
Mr. Saunders,
you said you object.

15:08.970 --> 15:10.938
SAUNDERS: I do, to all of it.
MAGISTRATE: "All of it"?

15:10.970 --> 15:12.301
SAUNDERS: The snail's pace
of these proceedings,

15:12.340 --> 15:14.274
for one thing.
My client, Mr. Kotite,

15:14.310 --> 15:15.709
is a busy man;
he deserves better.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.298
MAGISTRATE: Mr. Saunders...
SAUNDERS: My Lord,

15:17.350 --> 15:19.079
the government's case
is packed to the gills

15:19.110 --> 15:21.271
with second hand whispers
and hearsay.

15:21.320 --> 15:23.140
That might be less objectionable

15:23.190 --> 15:25.146
if they had the first clue
who to listen to.

15:25.190 --> 15:27.283
Maybe then, they would know
about the Chinese astronauts

15:27.320 --> 15:30.221
watching us through our phones;
they'd know you can't flush

15:30.260 --> 15:33.423
50 pounds of cyclonite down
the oldest toilet in Caracas

15:33.460 --> 15:36.452
and expect Venezuelan democracy
to survive.

15:36.500 --> 15:39.162
And you yourself, My Lord,
might know how much gold

15:39.200 --> 15:41.293
is buried under
the Great Pyramid of Giza

15:41.340 --> 15:45.162
if you would just listen to the
voices that are all around...

15:45.210 --> 15:47.098
We spoke to a colleague
of Saunders today.

15:47.140 --> 15:49.233
He said that Saunders
suffered from schizophrenia.

15:49.280 --> 15:52.249
Obviously, he was off his meds
the day this was recorded.

15:52.280 --> 15:55.647
Okay, so we can prove now
that Saunders wasn't a well man.

15:55.680 --> 15:57.045
How does that help us?

15:57.090 --> 15:58.648
All those theories
he rattled off--

15:58.690 --> 16:00.715
Chinese astronauts, cyclonite,

16:00.760 --> 16:02.182
the Great Pyramid
of Giza.
Yeah?

16:02.220 --> 16:03.551
I'm pretty sure one
of them is true.

16:03.590 --> 16:04.682
I think that's
why the DIA's

16:04.730 --> 16:06.288
been going around
killing people.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.730
SAUNDERS: ...they would know
about the Chinese astronauts

16:14.770 --> 16:16.260
watching us through our phones.

16:16.300 --> 16:18.768
They'd know you can't flush
50 pounds of cyclonite

16:18.810 --> 16:20.698
down _the oldest toilet
in Caracas

16:20.740 --> 16:23.447
and expect Venezuelan democracy
to survive.

16:23.480 --> 16:26.301
And you yourself, My Lord,
might know how much gold

16:26.350 --> 16:28.716
is buried under
the Great Pyramid of Giza

16:28.750 --> 16:31.787
if you would just listen to the
voices that are all around us!

16:31.820 --> 16:33.310
MAGISTRATE: Mr. Saunders...
KITTY: Clearly, the attorney

16:33.360 --> 16:35.157
we spoke to was right;
his friend was a nutter.

16:35.190 --> 16:36.782
And yet...

16:36.820 --> 16:38.378
Something he just said
has to be worth killing over,

16:38.430 --> 16:39.658
because listen...
SAUNDERS: My Lord,

16:39.690 --> 16:41.123
I will be heard!
MAGISTRATE: That's it.

16:41.160 --> 16:42.559
We're adjourned for the day.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.522
Ms. Perth, are you all right?

16:44.570 --> 16:46.526
That's Cheryl Perth
he's checking on.

16:46.570 --> 16:49.038
She was a substitute
stenographer at the courthouse.

16:49.070 --> 16:50.298
I went over all the
tapes from the trial.

16:50.340 --> 16:51.432
Now, every day
but this one,

16:51.470 --> 16:54.075
when the magistrate wanted
the transcript read back,

16:54.110 --> 16:56.601
he asked a stenographer
named Donna Reiter.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.803
But she was out sick the day
Saunders went off the rails.

16:59.850 --> 17:01.408
Look at this.

17:01.450 --> 17:03.714
It ran in a British paper
three weeks ago.

17:04.850 --> 17:05.919
"Cheryl Perth,

17:05.950 --> 17:08.089
"beloved wife and mother,
died Sunday in Glastonbury,

17:08.120 --> 17:10.122
the victim
of a sudden stroke."

17:10.160 --> 17:12.048
Meanwhile, Donna Reiter
is alive and well.

17:12.090 --> 17:13.796
Cheryl Perth filled in
the one day

17:13.830 --> 17:15.422
Saunders spilled a secret
worth killing over.

17:15.460 --> 17:16.495
We're luclq that

17:16.530 --> 17:18.691
Saunders melted down
during a pre-trial hearing.

17:18.730 --> 17:21.062
If there had been a jury,
they'd all be dead, too.

17:21.100 --> 17:22.362
I know it sounds crazy,

17:22.400 --> 17:24.163
but something about
Chinese astronauts,

17:24.210 --> 17:25.563
Venezuelan toilet bombs,

17:25.610 --> 17:27.237
or gold under
the pyramids

17:27.280 --> 17:28.133
has gotten everyone killed.

17:28.180 --> 17:29.329
We just have to figure out
what it was.

17:29.380 --> 17:30.574
That's no mystery.

17:30.610 --> 17:32.407
It was the Venezuelan
toilet bomb.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.513
WATSON: "Library Blast
Kills 36 in Caracas

17:38.550 --> 17:40.188
on Eve of Election."

17:40.220 --> 17:41.756
You can be forgiven
for missing this story.

17:41.790 --> 17:44.179
We were working around the clock
to prove Kotite's guilt

17:44.230 --> 17:45.356
when this bomb detonated

17:45.390 --> 17:47.199
two days ago.

17:47.230 --> 17:49.448
He clearly heard
about it, though.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.559
You think that's why Kotite
called you the other night.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.636
He realized why everyone
from his trial was dying.

17:53.670 --> 17:55.331
It says here that the
president of Venezuela

17:55.370 --> 17:58.635
was at a gala in the historic
National Library Building

17:58.670 --> 18:01.468
when 50 pounds of cyclonite
leveled half the place.

18:01.510 --> 18:03.649
Tom Saunders was raving
about that exact kind

18:03.680 --> 18:06.342
and amount of explosive
three years ago.

18:06.380 --> 18:09.349
"The blast is thought to have
originated in a men's restroom."

18:09.380 --> 18:10.517
What was it

18:10.550 --> 18:12.245
that Saunders said?

18:12.290 --> 18:14.485
"The oldest toilet in Caracas."

18:14.520 --> 18:16.215
I can't vouch for the age
of the toilet,

18:16.260 --> 18:18.785
but I will defer to the
schizophrenic who's been right

18:18.830 --> 18:20.229
about absolutely
everything else.

18:20.260 --> 18:21.750
Almost makes me want
to dig for gold in Giza.

18:21.800 --> 18:22.824
Somehow, he knew

18:22.860 --> 18:24.896
about a bombing three years
before it happened.

18:24.930 --> 18:27.364
He was raving about it
during Eli Kotite's trial,

18:27.400 --> 18:29.391
which sealed the fates
of everyone who heard him.

18:29.440 --> 18:30.862
The murders that happened here

18:30.910 --> 18:32.901
in the US. and in England
were part of a cover-up.

18:32.940 --> 18:34.498
HOLMES:
Kotite rang

18:34.540 --> 18:37.145
two hours after the news
of this hit the wire.

18:37.180 --> 18:39.398
Five minutes later,
he hit the roof of his van.

18:39.450 --> 18:41.372
If he hadn't done,

18:41.420 --> 18:43.786
we'd have been much further
up the field days ago.

18:43.820 --> 18:44.889
WATSON: Okay, I have,
like, 900 questions,

18:44.920 --> 18:46.285
but I'll start
with the big one.

18:46.320 --> 18:49.209
What does this have to do
with Anson Gephardt?

18:49.260 --> 18:51.285
HOLMES: This looks like
more of his handiwork.

18:51.330 --> 18:52.649
The bombing
can best be described

18:52.690 --> 18:54.794
as a bloody piece
of political theater.

18:54.830 --> 18:56.525
As Kitty mentioned,
the president

18:56.560 --> 18:58.926
of Venezuela was almost
included in the body count.

18:58.970 --> 19:00.562
Emphasis on "almost."

19:00.600 --> 19:01.931
You think he was in on it?

19:01.970 --> 19:04.632
HOLMES: Tom Saunders said
that this bomb would

19:04.670 --> 19:05.932
"destroy democracy
in Venezuela."

19:05.970 --> 19:07.471
In a way, he was right.

19:07.510 --> 19:08.829
Look.

19:08.880 --> 19:10.745
The failed attempt
on the president's life

19:10.780 --> 19:11.906
swung the polls.

19:11.950 --> 19:13.577
He's been unpopular
for years.

19:13.620 --> 19:16.180
You think he won reelection
thanks to the sympathy vote?

19:16.220 --> 19:17.244
It didn't hurt.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.850
And it also helped
that he could blame the bombing

19:19.890 --> 19:20.857
on his competitor.

19:20.890 --> 19:22.710
The cyclonite was

19:22.760 --> 19:25.649
traced to Colombian rebels
who support the opp05ition.

19:25.690 --> 19:28.557
All right, I'm convinced.
I'm also utterly flummoxed.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.295
How the hell
did a London barrister

19:30.330 --> 19:32.321
know about a fake
assassmation attempt

19:32.370 --> 19:34.292
in Venezuela three years
before it happened?

19:34.340 --> 19:35.432
HOLMES:
Saunders was based

19:35.470 --> 19:37.358
in London, but his law firm,

19:37.410 --> 19:39.298
Farrell & Putnam,
are a global concern.

19:39.340 --> 19:41.308
They represent corporations
all over the world.

19:41.340 --> 19:42.830
So?

19:42.880 --> 19:45.576
Anson Gephardt clearly
went rogue a long time ago.

19:45.610 --> 19:47.271
He couldn't use
proper DIA channels

19:47.320 --> 19:48.878
to influence
this election,

19:48.920 --> 19:51.286
so I submit that he persuaded

19:51.320 --> 19:53.208
one of Saunders' _
corporate clients to help him.

19:53.260 --> 19:55.410
WATSON:
Why does a Middle Eastern

19:55.460 --> 19:58.554
affairs analyst
care about Venezuela?

19:58.590 --> 20:00.490
That's a good question,
but it's not the question.

20:00.530 --> 20:03.226
I'd like to know which
of Farrell & Putnam's clients

20:03.270 --> 20:04.897
was so keen to keep
President Orozco in power

20:04.930 --> 20:08.536
that they decided
to grease the skids with blood.

20:08.570 --> 20:10.299
KITTY: What's your plan?
You gonna go knocking

20:10.340 --> 20:12.763
on the doors of CEOs
of Fortune 500 companies,

20:12.810 --> 20:15.404
asking if they were
accessories to mass murder?

20:15.440 --> 20:18.739
We're gonna darken one doonNay,
and there won't be any knocking.

20:23.320 --> 20:24.742
Anything promising back there?

20:24.790 --> 20:26.348
WATSON:
I had high hopes

20:26.390 --> 20:27.652
for the two energy firms,
but to be honest,

20:27.690 --> 20:28.884
it looks like
they'd both benefit

20:28.920 --> 20:30.683
from a regime change
in Venezuela.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.948
I kind of doubt they're the ones
working with Gephardt.

20:32.990 --> 20:34.855
My money was on
Taradex Chemical.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.425
Their, uh, contracts certainly
reinforce the impression

20:37.470 --> 20:40.564
that they are an evil squid
with their arms wrapped tightly

20:40.600 --> 20:44.639
around the globe, but alas,
no ties to Caracas.

20:44.670 --> 20:47.275
Some early riser is gonna
wander in here soon.

20:47.310 --> 20:48.834
Why don't you move on
to food processing giants

20:48.880 --> 20:50.404
and I'll look at the airlines?

20:54.420 --> 20:56.479
So I heard you and Kitty talked.

20:56.520 --> 20:58.385
We did.

21:00.520 --> 21:01.817
What?

21:01.860 --> 21:03.589
Well, she told me
you seemed unhappy.

21:03.630 --> 21:06.383
I had a hard time believing
that, but now I don't.

21:06.430 --> 21:08.523
You want to tell me what gives?

21:08.560 --> 21:10.391
Nothing gives.

21:10.430 --> 21:11.863
Really?

21:11.900 --> 21:13.788
Gosh, you're
all the same.

21:13.840 --> 21:14.864
What, women?

21:14.900 --> 21:17.869
Protgs.

21:17.910 --> 21:18.865
You're leaving?

21:18.910 --> 21:19.899
Oh, yeah.

21:19.940 --> 21:22.431
Uh, found what
we're looking for.

21:28.450 --> 21:29.769
HOLMES:
Margaret was right.

21:29.820 --> 21:31.742
You went out for groceries
at 5:00 in the morning.

21:31.790 --> 21:33.815
Archie's ready to try solids.

21:33.860 --> 21:36.055
All you had in the fridge
was Bismarck herring.

21:36.090 --> 21:37.421
Oh, that'd put hairs
on his chest.

21:37.460 --> 21:38.779
You should see this.

21:38.830 --> 21:40.081
Actually, there's something
you should see first.

21:40.130 --> 21:41.950
We have some admirers.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.695
There's a couple of
buzz cuts camped out

21:43.730 --> 21:45.027
in a blue SUV down the block.

21:45.070 --> 21:46.389
WATSON:
Yeah, we saw them, too,

21:46.430 --> 21:47.533
coming back from our errand.

21:47.570 --> 21:49.834
You have to wonder what
Gephardt is telling his bosses

21:49.870 --> 21:51.406
so he can get
DIA resources

21:51.440 --> 21:52.702
to monitor us.

21:52.740 --> 21:53.934
RSabk_
creepy, isn't it?

21:53.980 --> 21:55.834
Trying to solve
a mess of murder

21:55.880 --> 21:58.075
under the watch of
the killer's henchmen.

21:58.110 --> 22:00.715
Indeed. If Gephardt doesn't
land in a cell soon,

22:00.750 --> 22:01.978
I expect I will.

22:02.020 --> 22:03.942
You said you had
something to show me.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.582
Have you found which
of Farrell & Putnam's

22:05.620 --> 22:07.781
corporate clients was in
on the Venezuela plot?

22:07.820 --> 22:09.913
Yes. None of them.

22:09.960 --> 22:13.054
This is a draft
of an import agreement.

22:13.090 --> 22:15.991
Bronco Foods striking a deal
to buy cocoa by the ton.

22:16.030 --> 22:18.464
But take a look at the
handwritten note in the margin.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.388
"Revise in light of 3/12/17."

22:20.440 --> 22:21.998
That's the date
of the bombing in Caracas.

22:22.040 --> 22:24.531
WATSON: On a contract
signed three years ago.

22:24.570 --> 22:26.936
So whichever lavwer signed this
knew as much as Tom Saunders

22:26.970 --> 22:28.403
about what Gephardt
was planning.

22:28.440 --> 22:30.078
It's not often the person
we're looking for

22:30.110 --> 22:33.511
literally signs his work,
but Sydney Garber did.

22:34.920 --> 22:35.944
Take a close look
at the threes.

22:35.980 --> 22:38.016
Perfect match.

22:38.050 --> 22:39.688
Well, that explains why
he was so quick

22:39.720 --> 22:41.813
to dismiss the idea
that Saunders was murdered.

22:41.860 --> 22:44.078
Yes, but it doesn't explain
why a rogue DIA analyst

22:44.130 --> 22:45.779
was in cahoots with
two white-shoe attorneys

22:45.830 --> 22:47.058
in the first place.

22:47.090 --> 22:50.491
Hoping Mr. Garber will be more
forthcoming on that topic today.

22:50.530 --> 22:51.895
Somehow I doubt
he'll be as eager

22:51.930 --> 22:53.022
to meet us as yesterday.

22:53.070 --> 22:54.765
You two will manage.

22:54.800 --> 22:55.937
What, you're not coming?

22:55.970 --> 22:57.164
I would love to,
but that would be

22:57.200 --> 23:00.033
tipping our hand to the two
stooges watching our front door.

23:00.070 --> 23:01.503
Before you go
and see Garber,

23:01.540 --> 23:03.576
I will let them
tail me to New Haven.

23:03.610 --> 23:05.146
There's a Pride parade
there today.

23:05.180 --> 23:07.978
IfI hurry, my two new friends
and I could march in it.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.772
(elevator bell dings)

23:09.820 --> 23:10.980
If Watkins is
handling that brief,

23:11.020 --> 23:12.487
it's gonna need a rewrite.

23:12.520 --> 23:13.919
Make sure you're
looking over his shoulder.

23:15.620 --> 23:17.087
Uh, thanks, Jonathan.

23:17.120 --> 23:20.692
I'll call after lunch
ifI need anything else.

23:20.730 --> 23:23.119
This is a surprise, Ms. Winter.
Who's your friend?

23:23.160 --> 23:24.923
Joan Watson.

23:24.970 --> 23:27.666
She's here to make sure
I don't beat you too soundly

23:27.700 --> 23:29.463
if you lie to me again.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.832
You sound confused.

23:31.870 --> 23:33.804
I'd be happy to set you
straight, but I don't have

23:33.840 --> 23:35.671
any openings in my schedule
today, ladies.

23:35.710 --> 23:37.644
Call for an appointment
next time.

23:37.680 --> 23:40.001
Tom Saunders knew about
a Venezuelan bombing

23:40.050 --> 23:42.075
three years
before it happened.

23:42.120 --> 23:43.519
And so did you.

23:43.550 --> 23:45.541
You're trespassing now.
We're not doing this.

23:45.590 --> 23:47.478
Gentlemen, care to do your jobs?

23:50.960 --> 23:52.882
(motorcycle engine rewing)

23:55.760 --> 23:57.091
Get down!
What?

24:02.800 --> 24:04.700
(tires screeching)

24:05.770 --> 24:07.476
(gunshots)

24:12.880 --> 24:14.848
You're welcome.

24:14.880 --> 24:16.040
(groans)

24:23.690 --> 24:24.918
Thanks.

24:27.030 --> 24:29.021
I'm guessing you played soccer?

24:29.060 --> 24:31.028
I think you mean "football."

24:31.070 --> 24:32.219
Yeah, I do.

24:32.270 --> 24:34.158
Yes, because Miss Winter's foot
devastated your testicles.

24:34.200 --> 24:35.997
Very funny, yes.
Now, we could either continue

24:36.040 --> 24:37.905
with the double entendres,
or you could tell us

24:37.940 --> 24:40.135
your role in
Anson Gephardt's plot.

24:40.170 --> 24:43.139
Well, I told these two,
I'll tell you everything.

24:43.180 --> 24:45.045
It's probably the only way
I stay alive,

24:45.080 --> 24:47.548
now that Anson's sending
hit men after me.

24:47.580 --> 24:49.047
When I was in law school,

24:49.080 --> 24:51.514
I had a roommate;
his name was Alberto Seijas.

24:51.550 --> 24:53.552
He was from Venezuela.
We were close.

24:53.590 --> 24:56.912
After we graduated, I stayed
in New York, he went home.

24:56.960 --> 24:59.656
All these years later, I'm me,

24:59.690 --> 25:02.022
and he's the head
of Venezuelan intelligence.

25:02.060 --> 25:03.618
Gephardt approached me
three years ago.

25:03.670 --> 25:05.194
Said he wanted some
files from Alberto.

25:05.230 --> 25:08.165
I said, "Okay,
I'll put you in touch."

25:08.200 --> 25:09.758
He said,
"You don't understand.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.609
"These files, they're special.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.676
"There's gonna have to be
a negotiation,

25:13.710 --> 25:15.701
and you're gonna
handle it for me."

25:15.740 --> 25:17.549
What did these
files contain?

25:17.580 --> 25:18.979
Everything.

25:19.010 --> 25:21.274
What do you mean, "everything"?

25:21.320 --> 25:23.948
Have any of you ever heard
of the Fidel Files?

25:26.720 --> 25:28.119
A legendary trove
of intelligence,

25:28.160 --> 25:30.151
50 years in the making.

25:30.190 --> 25:31.885
Everything the Castros
ever shared

25:31.930 --> 25:34.194
with their communist allies
in the region.

25:34.230 --> 25:36.050
Your friend had access?

25:36.100 --> 25:37.920
Gephardt called it
the white whale

25:37.970 --> 25:39.790
of the intelligence community.

25:39.830 --> 25:42.264
Everybody wanted it,
nobody could get it.

25:42.300 --> 25:44.905
The stuff in those files,
it's supposed to be gold.

25:44.940 --> 25:46.339
KITTY:
So you brokered a deal

25:46.370 --> 25:48.338
between Gephardt
and your old flatmate.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.904
The former wanted the files,

25:49.940 --> 25:51.908
the latter wanted
a bomb to go off

25:51.950 --> 25:55.670
at a gala in Caracas
to help his boss, El Presidente.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.745
What was Tom Saunders' role?

25:57.790 --> 25:58.882
I didn't know from spies.

25:58.920 --> 26:00.979
I didn't know if helping
Gephardt was the right thing.

26:01.020 --> 26:03.011
So I asked Tom for advice.

26:03.060 --> 26:05.824
Obviously, that was a mistake,
because the very next time

26:05.860 --> 26:07.259
he went off his meds...

26:07.290 --> 26:09.929
He blabbed about the whole thing
to a roomful of people.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.359
And I told Gephardt.

26:11.400 --> 26:13.368
He told me _
not to worry about it,

26:13.400 --> 26:15.368
the bomb thing
might never happen.

26:15.400 --> 26:18.665
"It's a fluid situation,"
he said. "Years are gonna pass."

26:18.710 --> 26:21.338
Obviously, they liked
their original plan,

26:21.380 --> 26:23.268
because a bomb went off
two days ago.

26:23.310 --> 26:26.746
Couple of hours later,
I got an e-mail from Alberto.

26:26.780 --> 26:27.815
A big one.

26:27.850 --> 26:29.715
He sent you the files.

26:29.750 --> 26:31.718
And I sent them
to Gephardt.

26:31.750 --> 26:33.286
Next day, you came to see me
and said you thought

26:33.320 --> 26:35.117
Tom and the others
were actually murdered.

26:35.160 --> 26:37.754
I didn't know what to believe,
so I called Gephardt.

26:37.790 --> 26:39.951
He told me I had
nothing to worry about.

26:39.990 --> 26:42.891
I was an asset Of extreme value.

26:42.930 --> 26:45.228
Obviously, that was
a load of bull.

26:45.270 --> 26:46.999
You buying all this?

26:47.030 --> 26:49.032
As a matter of fact, I am.

26:49.070 --> 26:51.129
If you don't
believe me,

26:51.170 --> 26:53.309
there's a USB drive
on my key chain.

26:53.340 --> 26:54.830
Plug it into your computer

26:54.880 --> 26:57.030
and open it.
Why? What's on it?

26:57.080 --> 26:59.105
The Fidel Files.

26:59.150 --> 27:01.914
Every document,
every photograph, every video.

27:01.950 --> 27:04.043
I made a copy
before I handed it over

27:04.090 --> 27:05.318
to Gephardt.

27:05.350 --> 27:08.183
You'll know everything he knows.

27:08.220 --> 27:10.688
KITTY: Most of these file names
are in Spanish,

27:10.730 --> 27:12.186
but that doesn't prove
they're the Fidel Files.

27:12.230 --> 27:13.720
HOLMES: We'll have to
look at them.

27:13.760 --> 27:15.250
When Gephardt and I
had our chat,

27:15.300 --> 27:16.995
he made it quite clear
that his superiors

27:17.030 --> 27:18.725
were_not aware
of his efforts.

27:18.770 --> 27:21.193
He and he alone was making plans
to act on these files.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.333
If we can work out how...

27:23.370 --> 27:26.203
We may be able to ﬁgure out
where he'll strike next.

27:26.240 --> 27:28.276
Just got a hit
on our Finest Message.

27:28.310 --> 27:30.744
Patrol found a motorcycle
fitting the description

27:30.780 --> 27:32.873
of the one the shooter used
in that garage.

27:32.910 --> 27:34.673
No sign of the driver,
but thought one of you

27:34.720 --> 27:36.278
might want to come with me
to take a look.

27:36.320 --> 27:39.084
I'll go. You guys
dig into the files.

27:39.120 --> 27:41.111
I'll let you know
if we find anything.

27:44.060 --> 27:47.427
So... unis_talked
to a mailman

27:47.460 --> 27:49.849
who saw the shooter
park the motorcycle,

27:49.900 --> 27:51.162
pull off his helmet,

27:51.200 --> 27:52.963
get into a black sedan
that drove off.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.365
But he didn't see the guy's face

27:54.400 --> 27:56.288
or the license plate
on the sedan.

27:56.340 --> 27:59.229
Still, sounds like
a DIA op, right?

27:59.270 --> 28:01.704
One of Gephardt's men
shot up that garage,

28:01.740 --> 28:04.243
another picked him up
right here.

28:04.280 --> 28:07.306
Actually, I think Gephardt
pulled the trigger himself.

28:07.350 --> 28:08.874
See these hairs?

28:08.920 --> 28:10.842
They're dyed red,
just like the ones

28:10.890 --> 28:12.141
inside the backhoe
that Gephardt used

28:12.190 --> 28:14.454
to dig up that grave.
(phone chimes)

28:14.490 --> 28:16.014
It's the captain.

28:16.060 --> 28:17.880
Said Gephardt just
sent a message.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.352
What, to the police?

28:19.390 --> 28:21.824
No, to everyone.

28:23.360 --> 28:24.861
Hello, my name is
Anson Gephardt.

28:24.900 --> 28:26.891
I work for
the Defense Intelligence Agency.

28:26.930 --> 28:29.899
I'm speaking to you
from Jakarta.

28:29.940 --> 28:31.828
Three years ago, I set in motion

28:31.870 --> 28:34.009
events that would deliver
into American hands

28:34.040 --> 28:35.769
a collection of files

28:35.810 --> 28:39.143
representing an unprecedented
trove of intelligence.

28:39.180 --> 28:41.910
To guarantee this outcome,

28:41.950 --> 28:45.215
I have taken lives,
here and abroad.

28:45.250 --> 28:48.287
Now, some will brand
my actions excessive

28:48.320 --> 28:50.049
or overzealous.

28:50.090 --> 28:53.423
But let me assure you,
what I did had to be done.

28:53.460 --> 28:57.396
The information in these files
is that important.

28:57.430 --> 28:59.295
And that's why
I'm providing a link below

28:59.330 --> 29:02.060
that will grant access to
a digital copy of the files

29:02.100 --> 29:03.965
to anyone who wants
to read them.

29:04.010 --> 29:07.264
I did not intend for my story
to end this way.

29:07.310 --> 29:10.006
I did not plan
to reveal myself to you,

29:10.040 --> 29:12.474
but recent events
have forced my hand.

29:12.510 --> 29:14.319
I now believe it's for the best.

29:14.350 --> 29:16.477
You now know
where these files came from,

29:16.520 --> 29:19.318
and you understand
their significance.

29:19.350 --> 29:23.218
Here's to a better,
safer America for all of us.

29:25.460 --> 29:27.189
By "recent events,"
he's got to mean

29:27.230 --> 29:29.323
failing to kill Sydney Garber
in that garage this morning.

29:29.360 --> 29:31.294
He knew Sydney was
gonna help us expose him,

29:31.330 --> 29:32.820
so he beat us to the punch.

29:32.870 --> 29:34.337
He didn't just beat
us to the punch,

29:34.370 --> 29:35.928
he crushed us.

29:35.970 --> 29:37.801
His video's only
been up an hour,

29:37.840 --> 29:39.899
he's already got
over a million hits.

29:39.940 --> 29:41.305
He said he was in Jakarta.

29:41.340 --> 29:43.479
To travel to Indonesia
from New York

29:43.510 --> 29:45.068
would take at least a day.

29:45.110 --> 29:46.372
Now, if we're right,

29:46.410 --> 29:47.946
and he was the one
on the motorcycle,

29:47.980 --> 29:49.208
there's no way
he's in Indonesia.

29:49.250 --> 29:50.945
He may still even
be in New York.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.844
If he is, he doesn't know
that we know

29:52.890 --> 29:54.209
he lied about his location.

29:54.260 --> 29:56.114
That might give us a leg up.

29:57.520 --> 29:59.829
I suppose it's interesting
that an American president

29:59.860 --> 30:01.828
had an affair with
a Chinese opera singer,

30:01.860 --> 30:03.862
but is it startling?

30:03.900 --> 30:06.061
Might be to
the two men's families.

30:06.100 --> 30:07.829
But I take your point.

30:07.870 --> 30:10.839
Not all the Fidel Files
are Winners.

30:10.870 --> 30:12.235
Some of the intelligence
is too old

30:12.270 --> 30:13.874
to be of any use to anyone.

30:13.910 --> 30:15.537
I've been focusing
my attention on

30:15.580 --> 30:17.377
the information that was added
in the last decade.

30:17.410 --> 30:19.241
I think you'd be wise
to do the same.

30:19.280 --> 30:20.508
Would I?

30:20.550 --> 30:22.279
You said we should
dig into the files

30:22.320 --> 30:24.515
to see if they could help us
figure out Gephardt's next move,

30:24.550 --> 30:27.280
but he's made_ his next move:
put the files online.

30:27.320 --> 30:29.015
Do you really think
he's finished?

30:29.060 --> 30:30.857
I don't know
if he's finished.

30:30.890 --> 30:33.358
I just-- Are the files really
the best way to find him?

30:33.390 --> 30:34.527
He gave them to
literally everyone.

30:34.560 --> 30:35.629
Would he really
have done that

30:35.660 --> 30:38.026
if there was a clue in them
as to his whereabouts?

30:39.570 --> 30:42.164
Maybe they're just
an excellent way

30:42.200 --> 30:44.430
of avoiding
talking to me.

30:44.470 --> 30:45.505
Oh, for goodness' sake.

30:45.540 --> 30:47.235
No! You are unhappy

30:47.270 --> 30:49.272
because I've decided to
stop being a detective.

30:49.310 --> 30:51.540
I get it. But can
we please move on?

30:51.580 --> 30:53.639
We've been over this.
I'm n unhappy.

30:53.680 --> 30:56.012
I accept and, more importantly,
I understand your decision.

30:56.050 --> 30:58.041
Rubbish! You've
been frosty with me

30:58.090 --> 31:00.547
ever since you met Archie;
I'm not an idiot.

31:00.590 --> 31:02.558
But do you know, if-if
being a detective

31:02.590 --> 31:04.319
is the only way
to be your friend,

31:04.360 --> 31:06.089
then fine, you
and I are done.

31:06.130 --> 31:08.155
Well, thank you
for letting me know this time.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.997
That's quite unlike you.

31:10.030 --> 31:12.328
Excuse me?
The last time that you left,

31:12.370 --> 31:14.235
it wasn't made clear to me
that our friendship

31:14.270 --> 31:16.932
had run its course; it took me
two years to work that out.

31:16.970 --> 31:18.631
What are you talking about?

31:18.670 --> 31:20.661
Two years. Two years,
not a single word from you.

31:20.710 --> 31:23.270
I mean, you couldn't even be
troubled to send a simple e-mail

31:23.310 --> 31:24.948
to let me know you were okay.

31:27.350 --> 31:29.511
I don't mind whether
you're a detective or not.

31:29.550 --> 31:32.314
The only thing I want,
the only thing I've ever wanted,

31:32.350 --> 31:34.215
was for you to be happy.

31:34.260 --> 31:35.955
Against all the odds,

31:35.990 --> 31:39.187
it happened.

31:39.230 --> 31:41.596
You didn't tell me.

31:43.600 --> 31:46.262
Two years ago,
I was on the run.

31:46.300 --> 31:48.188
I'd just tortured
and disﬁgured a man.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.992
If the authorities
were looking for me,

31:50.040 --> 31:52.463
I didn't want you to have to lie
about where I was.

31:52.510 --> 31:54.307
Do you really think that
would've been hard for me?

31:54.340 --> 31:55.637
To lie to protect a friend?

31:57.610 --> 31:59.202
I've been asking myself

31:59.250 --> 32:00.672
what I could've done
differently,

32:00.710 --> 32:03.577
if I could've done
anything better.

32:03.620 --> 32:06.043
Friendship has never come
that easily to me.

32:06.090 --> 32:08.479
I thought that what we had
was-was meaningful.

32:08.520 --> 32:11.455
It was. It is.

32:11.490 --> 32:14.357
I mean, you made a...

32:14.400 --> 32:18.222
person, Kitty,
and you didn't tell me.

32:22.670 --> 32:23.489
(TV clicks on)

32:23.540 --> 32:25.201
NEWSWOMAN:
Pentagon officials say...

32:25.240 --> 32:26.207
Sherlock.

32:26.240 --> 32:27.161
Shh, listen.

32:27.210 --> 32:29.974
Arguably, the most troubling
piece of intel

32:30.010 --> 32:33.639
in the files was this video,
which is alleged proof

32:33.680 --> 32:36.513
that Iran has a secret
nuclear weapons program.

32:36.550 --> 32:38.188
KITTY:
I don't remember that bit

32:38.220 --> 32:39.482
about Iran in the files.

32:39.520 --> 32:41.249
Of course you don't,
'cause it isn't there.

32:41.290 --> 32:43.758
More precisely,
it isn't in our copy.

32:43.790 --> 32:45.655
What?

32:45.690 --> 32:47.578
Our copy of the Fidel Files
came from Sydney Garber.

32:47.630 --> 32:49.518
Theirs came from
Anson Gephardt.

32:49.560 --> 32:51.994
He added a file.

32:52.030 --> 32:53.725
Now we know why a Middle Eastern
affairs specialist

32:53.770 --> 32:56.238
got up to so much trouble
in Venezuela.

32:56.270 --> 32:57.965
He wants the US.
to go to war with Iran.

33:04.810 --> 33:06.277
This isn't good.

33:06.310 --> 33:07.641
That depends on
your perspective.

33:07.680 --> 33:09.648
If you sell tanks,
today beats Christmas.

33:09.680 --> 33:11.386
WOMAN:
Kami.

33:11.420 --> 33:13.684
NEWSWOMAN: That word
you hear there, "kami,"

33:13.720 --> 33:16.382
we dug that bit of audio
out of the digital file.

33:16.420 --> 33:19.457
Kami is a Farsi word meaning,
"Just a little."

33:19.490 --> 33:22.789
Perhaps a reference to how much
enriched uranium it takes

33:22.830 --> 33:25.128
to make that nuclear weapon
you see there.

33:25.170 --> 33:27.593
Marianne Lacosta is joining us
now from the Pentagon.

33:27.630 --> 33:29.439
Marianne, what's the mood there?

33:29.470 --> 33:32.337
And how are people reacting
to what appears to be

33:32.370 --> 33:35.168
a flagrant violation of
several treaties Iran has...

33:36.310 --> 33:38.039
I'd say the mood here
was tense, Denise.

33:38.080 --> 33:39.604
A multitrillion_-do||ar
war machine

33:39.650 --> 33:41.709
is lurching towards
a bloody showdown

33:41.750 --> 33:44.310
with an_unstab|e
theocratic regime,

33:44.350 --> 33:45.419
based on farcical
intelligence.

33:45.450 --> 33:46.815
Are you saying that,

33:46.850 --> 33:48.408
or is Marianne the reporter
saying that?

33:48.460 --> 33:50.155
I'm saying it.
I'm the only one saying it.

33:50.190 --> 33:51.726
We're the only people who know
that this tape's a fake.

33:51.760 --> 33:54.092
Wait, you know
the video is fake?

33:55.200 --> 33:58.067
Anson Gephardt is a Middle
Eastern affairs specialist

33:58.100 --> 33:59.328
with a 30-year career

33:59.370 --> 34:01.167
in military intelligence
behind him.

34:01.200 --> 34:02.758
He knows better than anyone
how to falsify such a thing,

34:02.800 --> 34:04.506
but consider the context.

34:04.540 --> 34:06.303
He's a war hawk
with a bee up his bum

34:06.340 --> 34:07.432
about the government in Tehran.

34:07.470 --> 34:08.402
And that video wasn't

34:08.440 --> 34:10.738
on the USB drive
that Sydney Garber gave us.

34:10.780 --> 34:13.442
Gephardt added it
to the Fidel Files himself?

34:13.480 --> 34:15.072
It's what he had in mind
all along.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.439
That's why he was so keen
to get his hands on the files.

34:16.480 --> 34:17.708
They're a Trojan horse.

34:17.750 --> 34:19.308
WATSON:
If he had posted this

34:19.350 --> 34:21.716
online by itself,
there'd be a million questions

34:21.760 --> 34:23.648
about whether it was real,
where it came from.

34:23.690 --> 34:25.419
People would just say
he filmed it in his basement,

34:25.460 --> 34:26.654
but now the shoe's
on the other foot.

34:26.690 --> 34:28.191
You've got to prove
it isn't real.

34:28.230 --> 34:30.255
Everything else in
the Fidel Files is.

34:30.300 --> 34:32.325
Well, the news has
certainly latched onto it.

34:32.370 --> 34:35.396
The Fidel Files are juicy;
there's nothing like a war

34:35.440 --> 34:36.737
to attract eyeballs.

34:36.770 --> 34:39.705
But I still think we can
depress their ratings.

34:39.740 --> 34:41.708
I'd say the cat's
out of the bag.
Cat's fake.

34:41.740 --> 34:44.174
You said it yourself,
you can't prove it.

34:44.210 --> 34:45.802
I know someone who can.

34:45.850 --> 34:47.738
Anson Gephardt has
absurdly bought himself

34:47.780 --> 34:50.476
a great deal of credibility
on this topic.

34:50.520 --> 34:52.681
If he copped to the tape
being his creation,

34:52.720 --> 34:54.813
the cat from the
bag would be dead.

34:54.860 --> 34:56.714
I'm not sure how to pry
such an admission

34:56.760 --> 34:58.182
out of a murderous ideologue,

34:58.230 --> 35:00.482
but step one is
certainly finding him.

35:00.530 --> 35:02.657
Actually, I don't think
that step's gonna be a problem.

35:02.700 --> 35:04.190
NEWSWOMAN:
This was a coordinated effort

35:04.230 --> 35:06.369
by the FBI and DIA.

35:06.400 --> 35:08.630
Anson Gephardt is now engaged
in a standoff

35:08.670 --> 35:11.366
with federal authorities
from those two agenCIes

35:11.410 --> 35:14.800
at his mother's home
in Riverdale, New York.

35:14.840 --> 35:17.274
What's step two?

35:18.850 --> 35:20.806
Well, then you find your boss
and I'll yell at him.

35:20.850 --> 35:22.647
This should've
been our scene.

35:22.680 --> 35:24.841
Just... wait here.

35:27.950 --> 35:29.508
GREGSON:
You got here fast.

35:29.560 --> 35:32.154
Really? Looks to me
like we're late.

35:32.190 --> 35:34.397
Jurisdictional mess.
We were out of the loop.

35:34.430 --> 35:36.398
FBI's blaming DIA

35:36.430 --> 35:38.660
for trying to grab him
on the sly like this.

35:38.700 --> 35:39.894
They came in undermanned.

35:39.930 --> 35:41.659
This just ended a minute ago.

35:41.700 --> 35:42.894
Anyone hurt?

35:42.940 --> 35:44.805
GREGSON: Gephardt took
two in the shoulder.

35:44.840 --> 35:46.831
He was standing too close
to that window there.

35:46.870 --> 35:48.838
EMTs are tending
to him now.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.632
We need to get in there
and talk to him now.

35:50.680 --> 35:52.944
Maybe you didn't understand.
This isn't our scene.

35:52.980 --> 35:54.709
They're gonna whisk him
out of here,

35:54.750 --> 35:56.547
and we're_ never_
gonna see him again.

35:56.580 --> 35:58.445
He needs to confess
as soon as p055ible.

35:58.490 --> 36:01.186
He did, on tape
to the whole world, remember?

36:01.220 --> 36:03.552
He confessed to multiple
murders and terrorism.

36:03.590 --> 36:04.921
He forged a video

36:04.960 --> 36:06.780
which could start
World War Three.

36:06.830 --> 36:08.923
Just get me in there.
I'll-I'll explain.

36:08.960 --> 36:11.155
(dog barking)

36:17.270 --> 36:20.467
Hey, looks like you're gonna
get your stuff back.

36:20.510 --> 36:21.670
Gallows humor.

36:21.710 --> 36:23.701
If you don't come clean,
you will need that.

36:23.740 --> 36:28.439
I don't expect a parade,
but I did my country a service.

36:28.480 --> 36:29.879
I showed them the truth.

36:29.920 --> 36:31.615
You sold them a hoax.

36:31.650 --> 36:33.288
The Iran tape is a forgery.

36:34.820 --> 36:37.584
Now, who's gonna believe that?

36:37.620 --> 36:39.759
Walk it back.
Spare a needless war.

36:41.960 --> 36:43.689
GREGSON:
Just give him a minute!

36:43.730 --> 36:45.869
Hey, hey, you're not
authorized to be here.

36:45.900 --> 36:47.822
Tell them.

36:47.870 --> 36:50.566
I'll tell them nothing,
Mr. Holmes.

36:50.600 --> 36:53.239
I'm a patriot. I always will be.

36:53.270 --> 36:55.704
Get out now. You two,
roll him, hospital.

36:55.740 --> 36:57.537
GREGSON: Look, we're gonna
put five murders on this guy.

36:57.580 --> 36:59.502
My people
deserve a chance.

36:59.550 --> 37:00.949
There are bigger fish to fry.

37:00.980 --> 37:03.972
Now you guys got to
give us the room.

37:12.660 --> 37:15.390
This house have a cellar?

37:19.800 --> 37:21.028
(wolf whistles)

37:21.070 --> 37:22.765
Heard about the new 'do.

37:22.800 --> 37:24.506
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:24.540 --> 37:27.839
Makes me wonder what else
the NSA has heard recently.

37:27.870 --> 37:29.872
You're gonna
feign ignorance?

37:29.910 --> 37:31.901
You chose this spot to meet,
not a hundred yards away

37:31.950 --> 37:34.646
from where the DIA
dumped me three days ago.

37:34.680 --> 37:37.046
I just like the burrito
truck up the street.

37:37.080 --> 37:40.447
You said you had proof the
Iranian nuclear tape is a fraud.

37:40.490 --> 37:43.755
Dispositive evidence,
material and visual.

37:43.790 --> 37:45.655
Anyone with half a brain

37:45.690 --> 37:48.591
is gonna be able to tell that
Gephardt made that tape himself

37:48.630 --> 37:50.655
in his mother's basement.

37:50.700 --> 37:52.520
Like, he was planning
an invasion of Iran,

37:52.570 --> 37:54.936
and she was upstairs
making him a grilled cheese?

37:54.970 --> 37:57.029
If it sounds outlandish,
pay the woman a visit.

37:58.540 --> 38:00.804
a yappy spaniel named Kammie.

38:00.840 --> 38:02.501
No one was saying
"Just a little" in Farsi

38:02.540 --> 38:03.768
in the background
on that tape.

38:03.810 --> 38:05.675
It wasn't an_ Iranian
nuclear SCIentist

38:05.710 --> 38:08.315
referencing how much enriched
uranium they were using.

38:08.350 --> 38:12.013
It was Gephardt's mother,
beckoning her pet

38:12.050 --> 38:13.688
in another part
of the house.

38:13.720 --> 38:15.608
(chuckles)
Oh, come on.

38:15.660 --> 38:17.082
You don't think
that's funny?

38:17.120 --> 38:19.554
Well, I might, if the
cable news commentariat

38:19.590 --> 38:22.058
weren't pimping this
bizarre puppet show.

38:24.060 --> 38:25.561
How do you feel
about Iran?

38:25.600 --> 38:28.023
(sighs)
That's irrelevant.

38:28.070 --> 38:31.062
You should be asking
how I feel about the truth.

38:33.610 --> 38:36.101
In case you're just telling
me what I want to hear,

38:36.140 --> 38:37.869
you should know
identical dossiers

38:37.910 --> 38:40.344
have been sent to the
NYPD, the FBI, and M16

38:40.380 --> 38:42.348
and a couple of
media outfits

38:42.380 --> 38:44.348
that I hold in relatively
limited contempt.

38:44.390 --> 38:46.449
We're on your team, Holmes.

38:46.490 --> 38:48.981
Wish you could see his face
when we confront him with this.

38:49.020 --> 38:50.453
Where is he being held?

38:50.490 --> 38:52.754
Good to see
you, Holmes.

38:59.400 --> 39:01.368
(phone chimes)

39:07.970 --> 39:10.700
Scheduled an exorcism?

39:10.740 --> 39:12.469
Is it for you or me?

39:12.510 --> 39:14.546
Sit down, will you?

39:19.920 --> 39:21.558
I have been thinking

39:21.590 --> 39:24.013
about everything that
you said last night.

39:24.060 --> 39:25.459
Yes?

39:25.490 --> 39:27.378
You were right.

39:29.060 --> 39:32.996
When I went back to London,
it was really hard.

39:33.030 --> 39:36.090
I knew I'd come a really long
way in New York, and then,

39:36.140 --> 39:39.701
all of a sudden, my entire
support system was gone.

39:39.740 --> 39:41.708
So, I did what I
thought you would do.

39:41.740 --> 39:43.071
I threw myself
into the work.

39:43.110 --> 39:45.647
I took every case
that came my way.

39:45.680 --> 39:47.443
I practically haunted
Scotland Yard

39:47.480 --> 39:49.914
looking for ways
I could help people.

39:49.950 --> 39:53.442
And then, strangest
thing happened.

39:54.860 --> 39:57.556
I realized that
I didn't need it.

39:57.590 --> 40:01.549
There were other ways
I could help people.

40:01.600 --> 40:05.559
(sighs) All that weight I used
to heft about the place,

40:05.600 --> 40:08.125
all that darkness,
was gone.

40:08.170 --> 40:11.094
I felt like
myself again.

40:11.140 --> 40:13.506
The truth is, Sherlock,
that I'd been

40:13.540 --> 40:14.871
thinking about giving
up detective work

40:14.910 --> 40:16.832
a long time before
Archie came along.

40:16.880 --> 40:19.701
I just didn't know
how to tell you.

40:19.750 --> 40:21.775
I felt fixed,
but I knew that...

40:21.820 --> 40:24.789
well, I knew that you didn't,
so I just kept it to myself.

40:24.820 --> 40:26.219
Then before I knew it,
months had passed,

40:26.250 --> 40:28.855
and then a year
and then...

40:28.890 --> 40:31.484
Who knows? If Anson Gephardt
hadn't started killing people,

40:31.530 --> 40:35.125
then perhaps we never would've
seen each other again.

40:37.660 --> 40:40.788
You deserve much
better than that.

40:42.840 --> 40:45.559
I told you before you left
you'd always be my friend.

40:45.610 --> 40:47.498
See, that's the
thing, isn't it?

40:47.540 --> 40:49.201
We're not friends;
we never were.

40:51.210 --> 40:53.747
We're family.

41:00.790 --> 41:02.519
Come inside, will you?

41:05.860 --> 41:07.885
*

41:14.770 --> 41:17.591
Archie's being
christened today.

41:17.640 --> 41:20.507
I've never been much
of a churchgoer,

41:20.540 --> 41:23.008
but I thought this was a good
way to make it official.

41:23.040 --> 41:25.144
The family thing.

41:25.180 --> 41:26.909
You, me and Watson.

41:26.950 --> 41:30.613
You want us to be godparents.

41:30.650 --> 41:34.711
If you're not too busy, yeah.

41:34.760 --> 41:37.718
That way, we'd have to stay
in touch, wouldn't we?

41:37.760 --> 41:39.751
For Archie's sake.

41:39.790 --> 41:43.749
* I'll help you...

41:43.800 --> 41:47.019
Would you believe I've-I've
never been a godparent before?

41:47.070 --> 41:51.188
Don't take this the wrong way,
but, yeah, I would.

41:51.240 --> 41:53.538
I-Is there something
I'm supposed to do?

41:53.570 --> 41:54.901
Recite a prayer or something?

41:56.840 --> 42:00.071
_ Come on.
We'll figure it out together.

42:00.110 --> 42:04.740
* I love you a lot

42:04.790 --> 42:07.839
* Whatever you want

42:07.890 --> 42:10.211
* Wherever you are

42:10.260 --> 42:11.921
* Wherever you are *

42:11.960 --> 42:16.329
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

42:16.360 --> 42:17.657
* Wherever you are

42:17.700 --> 42:19.793
* Ooh, ooh.
