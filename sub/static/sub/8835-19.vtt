02:03.416 --> 02:04.626
Man: HOLD ON!

02:04.793 --> 02:06.544
[IRISH ACCENT]
HOLD ON, FRIEND.

02:06.711 --> 02:08.505
OH, NO CAUSE
FOR ALARM.

02:08.671 --> 02:12.425
THE ENEMY HAS FLED. THE
SITUATION IS WELL IN HAND.

02:12.592 --> 02:13.426
WHO ARE YOU?

02:13.593 --> 02:15.929
WILLIAM O'HARA'S
THE NAME.

02:16.095 --> 02:17.305
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

02:17.472 --> 02:20.099
JUST TRYING TO BE
A GOOD NEIGHBOR, FRIEND.

02:20.266 --> 02:23.645
TRYING TO BE
OF SERVICE.

02:23.812 --> 02:25.688
Caroline: CHARLES,
WHAT IS IT?

02:25.855 --> 02:27.524
IT'S ALL RIGHT, CAROLINE.
GET BACK IN THE HOUSE.

02:28.942 --> 02:30.151
SO SORRY, MA'AM.

02:45.500 --> 02:47.043
HOPE I DIDN'T SCARE YA.

02:49.254 --> 02:50.630
WHY THE SHOOTING?

02:50.797 --> 02:56.010
WELL, NOW, I WAS COMING DOWN
THE ROAD YONDER WITH MY WAGON,

02:56.177 --> 02:58.805
LOOKING FOR A PLACE
TO CAMP FOR THE NIGHT,

02:58.972 --> 03:03.977
WHEN OUT OF THE CORNER OF ME EYE, I
SEE A BOBCAT CREEPING IN YOUR YARD.

03:04.143 --> 03:06.354
"AHA!" THINKS ME.

03:06.521 --> 03:09.190
"I COULD DO THE MAN
WHO LIVES HERE A FAVOR."

03:09.357 --> 03:13.278
SO I CAUGHT UP MY GUN
AND WENT AFTER THE FURRY THIEF,

03:13.444 --> 03:17.782
BUT, ALAS, ME AIM WAS NOWHERE
AS GOOD AS ME INTENTION.

03:20.702 --> 03:22.412
WELL, I THANK YOU
FOR TRYING, MR. O'HARA.

03:22.579 --> 03:25.039
OH, I'D BE PLEASED
IF YOU'D CALL ME "WILL"

03:25.206 --> 03:29.335
OR "WILLIE," AS YOU
PLEASE, AS IT SUITS YA.

03:29.502 --> 03:31.421
I'M THE CIRCUS MAN.

03:31.588 --> 03:36.426
SOLE OWNER AND PROPRIETOR OF THE
O'HARA CIRCUS AND MENAGERIE.

03:36.593 --> 03:41.848
NOT THE LARGEST EXHIBITION, BUT
ONE OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY.

03:42.015 --> 03:47.645
WELL, IT'S GETTING LATE NOW, AND I MUST
STILL FIND A PLACE TO STAY FOR THE NIGHT.

03:47.812 --> 03:49.689
HOPE I DIDN'T SCARE YA,

03:49.856 --> 03:51.983
AND I CERTAINLY HOPE
I WAS OF SERVICE.

03:55.403 --> 03:56.571
UH, WAIT A MINUTE.

04:03.953 --> 04:05.538
YOU'RE WELCOME TO STAY
THE NIGHT HERE IF YOU'D LIKE.

04:05.705 --> 04:08.666
YOU CAN PUT YOUR MULES IN THE CORRAL.
PLENTY OF FEED AND WATER.

04:08.833 --> 04:10.877
YOU CAN PULL YOUR WAGON UP
RIGHT BY THE BARN.

04:11.044 --> 04:14.631
OH, NOW, THAT'S
VERY KIND OF YOU.

04:14.797 --> 04:18.259
IF YOU'RE SURE I WON'T BE IN
THE WAY, I'D BE MUCH OBLIGED.

04:19.886 --> 04:21.596
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.

04:21.763 --> 04:23.473
GOOD NIGHT.

04:23.640 --> 04:25.683

GET YOUR NAME, SIR.

04:25.850 --> 04:27.268

04:27.435 --> 04:30.021
OH, THAT'S A FINE NAME.

04:30.188 --> 04:32.732
THANK YOU, SIR.

04:32.899 --> 04:33.983
GOOD NIGHT.

04:49.499 --> 04:52.085
Laura: ISN'T
THAT PRETTY?

04:52.251 --> 04:54.420
JUST GRAND.

04:54.587 --> 04:56.798

04:56.965 --> 05:00.051

HELLO.

05:00.218 --> 05:01.594
DID YOU
HEAR THAT?

05:03.471 --> 05:05.431
THAT BIRD
IS TALKING.

05:07.517 --> 05:10.436
WELL, WELL, WELL.

05:10.603 --> 05:12.563

05:14.607 --> 05:17.110

05:20.738 --> 05:23.449
WELL, WELL, WELL.

05:26.869 --> 05:28.788
OHH.

05:32.333 --> 05:33.960
OH, NOW.

05:34.127 --> 05:35.920
I WAS SURE I'D FIND
TWO PIXIE WINGS

05:36.087 --> 05:37.755
FIXED TO
YOUR SHOULDERS.

05:37.922 --> 05:39.966
WE'RE NOT PIXIES,
WE'RE GIRLS!

05:40.133 --> 05:41.926
NO SUCH THING
AS PIXIES.

05:42.093 --> 05:45.138
WHAT'S THIS YOU'RE SAYING?
NO PIXIES?

05:45.304 --> 05:50.977
NO LITTLE PEOPLE? NO LEPRECHAUNS?
NO TROLLS?

05:51.144 --> 05:52.186

[RAVEN CROAKS]

05:55.481 --> 05:57.316
FAREWELL. FAREWELL.

05:57.483 --> 06:00.695
HEY, MIND YOUR
MANNERS NOW, MR. POE.

06:00.862 --> 06:02.864
THESE TWO
ARE HONORED GUESTS.

06:03.031 --> 06:05.616
Mr. Poe: COME ONE, COME ALL.
SEE THE CIRCUS.

06:05.783 --> 06:11.372
LADIES, WOULD YOU MIND
STEPPING THIS WAY, PLEASE?

06:17.295 --> 06:19.338
CONGRILLA...

06:19.505 --> 06:21.591
FROM DARKEST AFRICA...

06:21.758 --> 06:23.801
FROM THE CONGO.

06:23.968 --> 06:27.472
AYE, KING OF THE APES.

06:27.638 --> 06:29.432
MASTER OF THE JUNGLE.

06:46.449 --> 06:48.367
HE'S NOT NEARLY
AS BIG AS--

06:48.534 --> 06:49.869
O'Hara: AS HIS PICTURE, EH?

06:50.036 --> 06:52.830
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S A BIT
OF A STORY, YOU KNOW.

06:52.997 --> 06:57.502
HE WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME, BUT WHEN I
TOLD HIM ABOUT THE WITCH DOCTOR.

06:57.668 --> 06:58.461
THAT'S RIGHT.

06:58.628 --> 07:00.880
HE CHASED HIM
WAY UP A TREE,

07:01.047 --> 07:04.634
WAY UP A TREE OUT ON THE SKINNIEST
BRANCH AT THE VERY TOP.

07:04.801 --> 07:09.055
SO HIGH, INDEED,
IT WAS BRUSHING THE SKY.

07:09.222 --> 07:12.058
AH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THAT WITCH DOCTOR DID.

07:12.225 --> 07:17.188
I WASN'T HIGH ENOUGH TO WATCH, BUT YOU CAN
SEE WITH YOUR OWN EYES WHAT HAPPENED.

07:19.732 --> 07:24.028
THAT WAS THE SIZE OF CONGRILLA
WHEN HE CAME DOWN FROM THAT TREE.

07:25.279 --> 07:26.989
Mr. Poe: TIME To Go.
TIME To Go.

07:27.156 --> 07:28.241
I THINK THE BIRD'S RIGHT.

07:28.407 --> 07:30.868
GO ON. HURRY UP.
YOU'LL BE LATE FOR SCHOOL.

07:31.035 --> 07:32.662
THANK YOU, SIR.

07:32.829 --> 07:33.704
WE'LL HURRY, PA.

07:33.871 --> 07:35.790
RIGHT.

07:35.957 --> 07:37.667
I NEVER HEARD
OF SUCH A THING.

07:37.834 --> 07:39.418
HE WAS JUST TEASING.

07:39.585 --> 07:43.339
WELL, HE'S GOT A BIRD THAT TALKS,
AND I NEVER HEARD OF THAT, EITHER.

07:46.551 --> 07:48.386
Pa: I TOLD YOU TO HURRY.
GO ON, NOW.

07:53.015 --> 07:54.142

SOMETHING WRONG SOMEWHERE.

IS A HEADACHE.

10:43.602 --> 10:46.439

BAKING POWDER AND EFFERVESCENT.

QUALITIES AT ALL.

WHAT I SAID THEY WERE.

29:19.050 --> 29:21.469
AGAIN AND AGAIN
I SAID IT.

WAS THEIR OWN IMAGINING.

IMPRESSION, BUT IT'S BLARNEY ONLY.

29:36.025 --> 29:39.571
WELL, MRS. OLESON BELIEVED, AND THAT
BELIEVING ALMOST COST HER HER LIFE.

29:39.737 --> 29:40.989

SPREADING THE WORD.

NO, NOT YET.

29:52.917 --> 29:55.378
HE WILL. I'M SURE.

31:24.759 --> 31:26.761
WELL, I'M AFRAID SO.

31:26.928 --> 31:30.265

SOME MAGIC TRICKS THIS MORNING.

31:30.431 --> 31:32.475
IT'S SATURDAY, AND
I WAITED ALL WEEK.

31:34.852 --> 31:36.104
WELL, HE WANTED ME TO
SAY GOOD-BYE FOR HIM,

EXPLAIN TO YOU
WHY HE COULDN'T DO IT.

31:38.523 --> 31:40.275
THEN HE LEFT AT
NIGHT IN THE DARK.

31:43.111 --> 31:44.195
SEE, THAT'S
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS

31:44.362 --> 31:46.030
YOU HAVE TO LEARN
ABOUT CIRCUS PEOPLE.

KIND OF UNPREDICTABLE,

31:51.202 --> 31:52.287
WHY NOT?

31:53.830 --> 31:55.832
WELL, THEY'RE JUST NOT.

31:55.999 --> 32:01.379
IT'S KIND OF HARD TO EXPLAIN, BUT, SEE, CIRCUS
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS USED TO BEING ON THE GO,

32:01.546 --> 32:03.840
JUST FOOTLOOSE
AND FANCY FREE.

32:04.007 --> 32:06.384

TO THEM.

32:08.720 --> 32:10.513
JUST SAY GIDDYUP,
AND THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY.

32:11.973 --> 32:14.058
YOU UNDERSTAND?

32:14.225 --> 32:18.605
I GUESS SO, BUT I WISH I COULD
HAVE TOLD HIM GOOD-BYE.

32:18.771 --> 32:19.731
I KNOW.

32:19.897 --> 32:21.774
HEY, I TELL YOU WHAT.

32:21.941 --> 32:26.279
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THE EGGS IN TOWN FOR MA.
EACH ONE OF YOU TAKE A PENNY

32:26.446 --> 32:28.197
AND GO INTO OLESON'S
AND GET SOME STRIPED CANDY.

32:28.364 --> 32:29.198
THANKS, PA.

32:29.365 --> 32:30.199
THANK YOU, PA.

32:30.366 --> 32:31.451
[JACK BARKS]

32:35.747 --> 32:37.624
CAN I TAKE JACK?

32:37.790 --> 32:40.251
I DON'T SEE WHY NOT.
IT'S SATURDAY.

32:40.418 --> 32:41.419
THANKS, PA.

32:41.586 --> 32:42.670
GO ON.

33:03.441 --> 33:05.109
NOW, YOU STAY HERE.

33:05.276 --> 33:07.111
YOU WAIT FOR ME, HEAR?

33:09.781 --> 33:11.074
YOU WAIT FOR ME.

33:12.950 --> 33:14.035
GOOD.

33:54.325 --> 33:56.411
[JACK CRIES]

33:57.078 --> 33:58.204
JACK!

34:01.207 --> 34:03.000
JACK.

34:03.167 --> 34:04.502
OH, JACK.

34:39.454 --> 34:41.706
DOC BAKER SAID HE DOESN'T
HAVE ANY BONES BROKEN.

34:41.873 --> 34:45.793
HE'S GOT SOME CUTS, A FEW SCRATCHES.
HE'S NOT BLEEDING ANYMORE.

34:45.960 --> 34:47.879
I WISH MR. O'HARA
WAS HERE.

34:51.174 --> 34:55.720
THEN HE COULD GIVE JACK
SOME OF HIS SECRET POWDERS.

34:55.887 --> 34:57.680
HE WOULD BE WELL
IN NO TIME.

35:03.853 --> 35:06.481
HALF-PINT, MR. O'HARA'S
POWDERS WOULDN'T HELP JACK.

35:08.983 --> 35:12.236
BUT IT MADE HIS
RIBS ALL BETTER

35:12.403 --> 35:14.071
IN JUST A COUPLE
OF DAYS.

35:18.201 --> 35:20.620
HALF-PINT, THE POWDER DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING TO MR. O'HARA'S RIBS

35:20.787 --> 35:22.747
BECAUSE THERE WAS
NOTHING WRONG WITH HIS RIBS.

35:24.707 --> 35:27.001
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,
HE WAS JUST PRETENDING.

35:29.170 --> 35:30.421
HE JUST WANTED
TO MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE

35:30.588 --> 35:34.050
THAT HIS POWDERS HAD
SOME MAGICAL HEALING POWER.

35:38.262 --> 35:40.139
HE'S JUST A FAKER.

35:40.306 --> 35:43.100
NO, HE WASN'T.

35:43.267 --> 35:44.602
YOUR FATHER'S RIGHT,
LAURA.

35:47.021 --> 35:48.940
NO, HE ISN'T.

35:49.106 --> 35:50.358
HE ISN'T RIGHT.

35:51.859 --> 35:54.987
Laura: I KNOW MR. O'HARA
COULD MAKE JACK FEEL BETTER.

36:07.375 --> 36:09.126
I'LL BE BACK
AS SOON AS I CAN.

36:09.293 --> 36:10.419
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

36:15.091 --> 36:17.134
TO GET O'HARA.

36:17.301 --> 36:19.804
IF JACK DIES, SHE'LL NEVER FORGIVE
ME FOR NOT BRINGING HIM BACK.

37:08.352 --> 37:09.937
YOU CAME BACK.

37:10.104 --> 37:13.024
OH, DID YOU THINK
I WOULDN'T

37:13.190 --> 37:15.776
ONCE I HEARD YOUR LITTLE
DOG WAS NEEDING ME?

37:29.707 --> 37:32.543
WILL YOU JUST BE GIVING
ME A LITTLE OF THE ROOM

37:32.710 --> 37:34.086
AND A LITTLE TIME
TO LOOK?

37:46.349 --> 37:49.435
OH, THANK YOU, PA.
THANK YOU.

37:49.602 --> 37:51.896
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING
MR. O'HARA BACK.

37:54.649 --> 37:58.235
NOW JACK WILL GET ALL BETTER.
YOU'LL SEE.

38:03.616 --> 38:04.992
YOU'LL NEED SOME WATER.

38:15.044 --> 38:18.631
WHOA. NOT FOR
JUST A MINUTE YET.

38:22.510 --> 38:27.264
WELL, AREN'T YOU GOING TO GIVE
HIM SOME OF YOUR SECRET POWDER?

38:27.431 --> 38:33.437
WELL, NOW, I'LL--I'LL HAVE TO
THINK ON THAT FOR A MINUTE.

38:33.604 --> 38:34.730
PLEASE.

38:50.663 --> 38:53.708
JUST A WEE BIT, NOW,

38:53.874 --> 38:56.085
FOR HE'S ONLY
A SMALL DOG.

39:18.107 --> 39:20.651
HE'LL GET WELL
NOW, WON'T HE?

39:20.818 --> 39:23.612
THE GOOD LORD WILLING.

39:23.779 --> 39:25.865
REST IS
WHAT HE NEEDS NOW.

39:28.826 --> 39:30.327
YOU AREN'T GOING TO LEAVE?

39:30.494 --> 39:31.996
OH, NO, CHILD, NO.

39:32.163 --> 39:34.832
JUST GOING OUTSIDE
TO TEND TO ME ANIMALS.

39:41.380 --> 39:42.590
I'LL GIVE YOU A HAND.

40:02.193 --> 40:04.403
YOU PROMISED YOU'D TELL HER
THE POWDERS WERE WORTHLESS.

40:07.531 --> 40:09.408
NO, FRIEND.

40:09.575 --> 40:11.827
ALL I SAID WAS I'D
COME BACK WITH YOU

40:11.994 --> 40:14.288
AND GIVE WHAT COMFORT I
COULD TO THE WEE ONE.

40:17.208 --> 40:18.501
YOU HAVE TO TELL HER.

40:21.253 --> 40:23.589
I HAD IT IN MY MIND TO,

40:23.756 --> 40:26.592
BUT WHEN IT CAME TIME,
I COULDN'T DO IT.

40:26.759 --> 40:28.928
NOR DID I HEAR YOU
SPEAKING UP

40:29.095 --> 40:31.347
WHEN SHE WAS THANKING YOU
FOR BRINGING ME BACK.

40:33.015 --> 40:34.100
WHY NOT?

40:48.072 --> 40:50.741
SHE'S GOT A BIT OF
HOPE TO CLING TO NOW.

40:52.743 --> 40:56.413
HER DOG WILL GET WELL
OR HE WON'T...

40:56.580 --> 40:58.415
NO MATTER WHAT
EITHER OF US DO.

41:00.084 --> 41:02.837
WHILE THE TERRIBLE
WAITING GOES ON,

41:03.003 --> 41:06.465
WOULD YOU STEAL THAT
BIT OF HOPE FROM HER?

41:06.632 --> 41:07.883
NO.

SO WE WAIT AND HOPE THE
GOOD LORD'S WILLING.

MAKE JACK WELL AGAIN.

44:28.167 --> 44:29.752
NOTHING ABOUT ME IS REAL.

44:31.545 --> 44:33.464
NOTHING.

ALL CIRCUS TRICKS.

44:44.808 --> 44:47.227
NOT THE POWDERS?

44:47.394 --> 44:49.897
ESPECIALLY THE POWDERS.

44:50.064 --> 44:53.776
IT'S SUGAR AND SODA
AND A BIT OF FIZZ.

44:55.402 --> 44:58.572
AND THAT'S ALL THEY ARE.

44:58.739 --> 44:59.865

45:14.588 --> 45:17.841

45:18.008 --> 45:21.220

BEHOLDEN TO ME.
