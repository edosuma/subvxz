What can I do for you?

00:21.040 --> 00:22.955
- I must visit the abbot.
- Almsgiver...

00:22.990 --> 00:24.605
...you can't enter the temple
without permission.

00:24.640 --> 00:26.950
- Stop please, almsgiver.
- No, I want to visit the abbot.

00:26.985 --> 00:30.200

- Please stop, almsgiver.

SHAOLIN TEMPLE

02:35.870 --> 02:37.760
ZEN

02:58.030 --> 03:01.690
Master, how on earth
will you take me in?

03:01.725 --> 03:03.285
I know that the Second Ancestor.

03:03.320 --> 03:05.425
...asked Dharma,
the founder of Buddhism...

03:05.460 --> 03:07.850
...to teach him the doctrine
by breaking his own arm.

03:07.885 --> 03:09.630
Since you're indifferent,
I'll break my leg.

03:09.665 --> 03:11.690
...to show my determination.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.050
- Who are you?
- Amitabha.

03:24.085 --> 03:26.300
Come in with me please.

03:28.170 --> 03:30.650
- What did you say?
- Come in with me please.

03:31.730 --> 03:33.795
- R-really?
- Yes.

03:33.830 --> 03:35.825
I can't believe it.

03:35.860 --> 03:38.380
The God opens his eyes at last.

03:38.630 --> 03:40.965
Abbot, I, Yao Hanwu...

03:41.000 --> 03:44.510
...hope to learn martial arts
in the Shaolin Temple.

03:44.545 --> 03:46.420
Almsgiver...

03:46.900 --> 03:49.870
...it is said that the Buddha
helps the right people.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.310
It is okay.

03:52.370 --> 03:54.440
...if you want to enter
the Shaolin Temple...

03:54.500 --> 03:57.225
...but you must meet three conditions.

03:57.260 --> 03:59.990
- What are the conditions?
- First...

04:00.025 --> 04:02.707
...one is to subdue the material world.

04:02.742 --> 04:05.390
- And be converted to Buddhism.
- Yes.

04:05.425 --> 04:07.480
- I can do that.
- The second.

04:07.515 --> 04:09.325
...is to forget hatred.

04:09.360 --> 04:11.880
...and give up any thought
of revenge...

04:11.915 --> 04:14.365
...and fame and gain
in the world...

04:14.400 --> 04:17.790
...since you're determination
to be converted to Buddhism.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.214
I can just agree to it.

04:19.250 --> 04:21.084
After I learn the martial arts...

04:21.120 --> 04:22.920
...they can do nothing about me.

04:23.290 --> 04:25.820
Okay, I can do that too.

04:25.855 --> 04:28.315
Buddhists don't lie.

04:28.350 --> 04:30.880
Almsgiver, you cannot lie.

04:30.915 --> 04:33.375
...in a Buddhist temple.

04:33.410 --> 04:35.065
The Abbot of the Shaolin Temple.

04:35.100 --> 04:38.430
...can see through me.
I must be careful.

04:38.640 --> 04:40.255
Hmm, yes yes, master.

04:40.290 --> 04:43.345
The third is that all the disciples.

04:43.380 --> 04:46.870
...must comply
with the rules of the temple.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.295
Almsgiver...

04:49.330 --> 04:53.050
- Do you have any objections?
- No! I have none.

04:54.140 --> 04:57.260
His face shows that
he is holding a grudge.

04:57.295 --> 04:59.767
He has to temper himself.

04:59.802 --> 05:02.240
It will not be easy for him.

05:02.275 --> 05:04.910
Okay, you can stay.

05:05.520 --> 05:09.730
Sengman, take the almsgiver
to water the vegetables.

05:09.765 --> 05:11.515
He will receive tonsure.

05:11.550 --> 05:14.620
when he gets used to the life
of an ascetic monk.

05:14.655 --> 05:16.530
Yes, abbot.

05:58.860 --> 06:00.435
No. No no.

06:00.470 --> 06:02.010
No no!

06:06.080 --> 06:08.070
Hey, what's wrong?

06:08.940 --> 06:11.240
Where is my sister?
Where is my sister?

06:12.550 --> 06:14.400
No sister here.

06:18.480 --> 06:20.370
Do you miss your family?

06:20.890 --> 06:22.635
Then go back.

06:22.670 --> 06:24.475
Why must you stay here?

06:24.510 --> 06:27.690
All we have here are
wooden beds and vegetables.

06:28.320 --> 06:29.870
I had a nightmare.

06:30.310 --> 06:32.620
Go to sleep, huh?

06:41.030 --> 06:43.215
Hey, you must have evil thoughts.

06:43.250 --> 06:45.660
Cut your nonsense.
I'll choke you to death.

06:45.695 --> 06:47.005
Who has evil thoughts?

06:47.040 --> 06:49.130
- Tell me. Are you going to tell me?
- I was only joking.

06:49.165 --> 06:51.140
L-let me go. Let me go.

06:51.175 --> 06:52.795
You were joking?

06:52.830 --> 06:55.230
It didn't sound like you were joking.

06:55.520 --> 06:57.345
It's true,
I swear to you.

06:57.380 --> 06:59.170
I'll believe you this time.

07:00.670 --> 07:01.945
Remember...

07:01.980 --> 07:04.820
I won't forgive you next time
you make a joke at me.

07:05.660 --> 07:08.160
- You got it?
- Yes.

07:32.010 --> 07:33.980
They want me to gain strength
by making me.

07:34.015 --> 07:35.910
...carry these two buckets of water.

07:35.945 --> 07:37.875
I want to learn kung fu.

07:37.910 --> 07:41.220
...and this...
this could take forever.

07:43.300 --> 07:44.820
No...

07:45.560 --> 07:47.800
I must figure
something out myself.

07:56.720 --> 07:58.395
Zhishou...

07:58.430 --> 08:00.800
when will you teach me kung fu?

08:01.330 --> 08:03.395
It's not that I wouldn't teach you...

08:03.430 --> 08:06.330
...but the court forbids us
to practice kung fu.

08:06.365 --> 08:08.155
Do me a favor, Zhishou.
You see...

08:08.190 --> 08:11.490
...it's just the two of us here.
No one is from the court.

08:11.525 --> 08:13.610
This...
I am not sure if I can help you...

08:13.645 --> 08:15.475
Hey, Zhishou, don't worry.

08:15.510 --> 08:18.330
You won't teach me for nothing.

08:22.520 --> 08:24.060
Here.

08:25.950 --> 08:28.870
- A token of my gratitude.
- Okay then.

08:32.360 --> 08:34.780
- Huh.
- No no no, here.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.510
Let me do it.

08:39.510 --> 08:41.909
I'll make an exception and teach you.

08:41.945 --> 08:42.595
Great.

08:42.630 --> 08:46.140
I'll teach you for the sake
of your sincerity...

08:46.175 --> 08:48.455
...but you must keep it a secret.

08:48.490 --> 08:50.730
Thank you, Zishou.
Thank you, Zishou.

08:52.020 --> 08:54.290
Hey, watch carefully.

08:59.450 --> 09:02.330
The first skill is
"Carrying the beam with two hands. "

09:03.070 --> 09:06.210
"C-c... Carrying the beam
with two hands. "

09:08.640 --> 09:10.570
- Eh, arms straight.
- Arms straight!

09:10.605 --> 09:12.890
- Knees bent.
- Knees bent!

09:15.390 --> 09:17.780
"Watch the sky from within. "

09:18.250 --> 09:20.280
"Watch the sky from within. "

09:20.315 --> 09:21.870
Look up!

09:23.440 --> 09:25.350
Look up. Up up!

09:25.385 --> 09:27.260
U-up... Oh uh.

09:27.610 --> 09:29.470
Knees bent!

09:34.150 --> 09:36.830
"Having strength all over. "

09:37.490 --> 09:40.710
"Having... Having strength all over. "

09:43.370 --> 09:46.280
Puff your chest out.
Knees bent.

09:49.850 --> 09:52.790
"Breathing out and taking back. "

09:55.920 --> 09:58.050
"Breathing out and taking back. "

10:00.580 --> 10:02.830
Hey, that one's easy.

10:03.670 --> 10:06.550
You know, you can grind
a stone up with your hand.

10:06.585 --> 10:08.885
...once you master the kill.

10:08.920 --> 10:11.250
...of "Having strength all over. "

10:11.285 --> 10:13.430
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:16.480 --> 10:19.880
Zhishou, here are two stones.
Do it with them.

10:22.190 --> 10:24.255
I haven't mastered the skill.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.305
I've reached the ninth level,
one level left.

10:27.340 --> 10:30.375
You are really great.
Zhishou, thank you, thank you.

10:30.410 --> 10:33.410
I'll be grateful to you
for the rest of my life.

10:33.445 --> 10:37.140
Ah, no need.
We were fated to meet.

10:37.820 --> 10:39.460
- So?
- Oh.

10:40.970 --> 10:42.430
Here.

10:43.490 --> 10:45.715
Thank you, thank you, Zishou.

10:45.750 --> 10:48.325
- Thank you, thank you, Zhishou.
- You're welcome.

10:48.360 --> 10:51.360
- Thank you very much.
- Practice hard, okay? Practice hard.

10:51.395 --> 10:52.650
Okay.

10:54.830 --> 10:56.955
"Carrying the beam
with two hands. "

10:56.990 --> 10:59.050
- "Watch the sky from within. "
- Practice seriously and attentively.

10:59.085 --> 11:01.270
Okay.
"Watch the sky. "

11:01.460 --> 11:03.510
"Having strength all over. "

11:03.545 --> 11:05.560
"Having strength all over. "

11:10.230 --> 11:12.760
"Breathing out and taking back. "

11:19.510 --> 11:21.215
"Carrying the beam
with two hands. "

11:21.250 --> 11:22.940
"Watching the sky
from the bottom of the well. "

11:22.975 --> 11:24.720
"Having strength all over. "

11:24.950 --> 11:28.300
- "Breathing out and taking back. "
- Excuse me.

11:28.335 --> 11:32.280
How far to the Shaolin Temple?

11:32.690 --> 11:34.790
Uh, go straight ahead...

11:34.825 --> 11:36.890
...about 10 miles away.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.430
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

11:40.210 --> 11:41.855
"Carrying the beam with two hands. "

11:41.890 --> 11:43.410
"Watching the sky
from the bottom of the well. "

11:43.445 --> 11:45.737
"Having strength all over. "

11:45.772 --> 11:47.711
"Breathing out and taking back. "

11:47.746 --> 11:49.615
"Carrying the beam with two hands. "

11:49.650 --> 11:51.370
"Watching the sky
from the bottom of the well. "

11:51.405 --> 11:53.537
"Having strength all over. "

11:53.572 --> 11:55.670
"Breathing out and taking back. "

11:56.430 --> 11:58.330
"Carrying the beam with two hands. "

11:59.280 --> 12:00.450
Excuse me.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.480
What skills are you practicing?

12:04.220 --> 12:07.240
To tell you the truth,
it's the real Shaolin fighting move.

12:07.275 --> 12:09.620
You're a Shaolin disciple?

12:09.655 --> 12:11.717
Oh no no no. I...

12:11.752 --> 12:13.745
I'm new here!

12:13.780 --> 12:16.220
Oh, so you haven't received ton-sure.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.805
That move you did...

12:18.840 --> 12:21.600
...is really weird.
It looked like you were squatting.

12:21.635 --> 12:23.255
And who are you?

12:23.290 --> 12:25.155
How dare you insult
the Shaolin kung fu?

12:25.190 --> 12:27.230
Watch this.
"Carrying the beam with two hands"!

12:27.265 --> 12:28.500
Forget it!

12:30.440 --> 12:32.090
You see?

12:45.390 --> 12:47.520
He said it looked like I'm squatting.

13:00.610 --> 13:03.670
Yeah.
It does look like that.

13:04.710 --> 13:06.260
Why didn't I see it before?

13:08.650 --> 13:11.210
Bastard!
How dare you trick me?

13:11.290 --> 13:13.925
Ow ow, my ass! Hey hey hey!

13:13.960 --> 13:17.160
- What are you doing? Ow ow!
- What am I doing?

13:17.260 --> 13:19.360
You tricked me!
You tricked me!

13:19.395 --> 13:20.895
Huh?
You tricked me!

13:20.930 --> 13:22.740
What are you doing?
What are you...

13:22.775 --> 13:24.515
I'm innocent!
Have you gone crazy?

13:24.550 --> 13:27.215
How dare you sleep!
All you know is how to sleep!

13:27.250 --> 13:30.640
Tell me, which kung fu did
I ask you to teach me? Tell me!

13:31.420 --> 13:33.730
- Shaolin kung fu!
- Shaolin kung fu!

13:33.765 --> 13:36.005
Was that Shaolin kung fu?
Was it?

13:36.040 --> 13:37.680
- No no no no!
- Why did you trick me?

13:37.715 --> 13:39.217
I didn't trick you!
I did not trick you!

13:39.252 --> 13:41.181
- You didn't trick me?
- Help me, help me!

13:41.216 --> 13:43.075
- No one can help you! No one!
- Help!

13:43.110 --> 13:45.140
- You didn't trick me!
- Help me! Stop, Yao Hanwu!

13:45.175 --> 13:47.135
- No one can help you.
- Somebody help me! Ahh!

13:47.170 --> 13:49.460
- No one can help you!
- I didn't trick you! I swear I didn't!

13:49.495 --> 13:51.740
- I didn't, so help me!
- Don't you ever trick me again.

13:53.230 --> 13:55.490
- No no! I did it for you, for you!
- For me?

13:55.560 --> 13:57.260
What do you mean?

13:59.720 --> 14:02.330
- Let you go?
- Stop! Stop!

14:02.810 --> 14:04.515
You tricked me!

14:04.550 --> 14:06.760
Evil for evil!
You tricked me!

14:06.795 --> 14:08.817
- Let me go!
- You tricked me!

14:08.852 --> 14:11.081
Listen here, punk.
Remember this:

14:11.116 --> 14:13.310
...don't you ever trick me again.

14:26.960 --> 14:30.030
"Listen here, punk.
Remember this... "

14:30.065 --> 14:31.980
We'll see that!

14:32.870 --> 14:33.935
Master!

14:33.970 --> 14:35.845
When can I start learning?

14:35.880 --> 14:38.385
You think you have not started...

14:38.420 --> 14:40.890
...but all of our students can learn.

14:40.925 --> 14:42.907
Please give me tonsure.

14:42.942 --> 14:44.890
I want to join Shaolin.

14:46.040 --> 14:48.165
I have already told you this before.

14:48.200 --> 14:51.940
You will receive tonsure
once you adapt to our ways.

14:51.975 --> 14:53.940
I've been here for almost one month.

14:53.975 --> 14:56.185
I only eat vegetables and rice.

14:56.220 --> 14:58.405
You haven't started
learning sutra.

14:58.440 --> 15:01.930
You will receive tonsure
after you start learning sutra.

15:01.965 --> 15:03.750
Master.

15:05.930 --> 15:08.060
Master? Master!

15:10.950 --> 15:12.220
Master!

15:12.690 --> 15:14.150
Zhishou?

15:14.980 --> 15:16.430
Zhishou!

15:24.180 --> 15:25.550
Okay.

15:36.100 --> 15:38.020
Hey, Zhishou.

15:39.520 --> 15:41.595
You're slacking off again!

15:41.630 --> 15:43.635
Master Sengzhi, I'm not.

15:43.670 --> 15:45.835
I could not do that hard work.

15:45.870 --> 15:48.900
- Because I was beaten up.
- Huh?

15:50.360 --> 15:52.765
Ow! Master, it really hurts.

15:52.800 --> 15:56.160
- Look.
- How could you have been beaten up.

15:56.195 --> 15:58.157
...if you just looked after the garden?

15:58.192 --> 16:00.120
Well, Master Sengzhi, look look.

16:00.155 --> 16:01.945
Yao Hanwu went crazy.

16:01.980 --> 16:04.005
Abbot assigned him here to work...

16:04.040 --> 16:07.720
...but he forced me to teach him kung fu
and I refused to.

16:07.755 --> 16:11.150
So he almost...
he almost beat me to death.

16:13.290 --> 16:15.530
He's gone too far!

16:15.565 --> 16:17.580
Yao Hanwu!

16:18.030 --> 16:20.440
Yao Hanwu, come here!

16:27.280 --> 16:29.045
Master Sengzhi.

16:29.080 --> 16:30.880
What do you want me to do?

16:30.915 --> 16:32.175
Tell me.

16:32.210 --> 16:34.635
what the sixth rule
of the temple says.

16:34.670 --> 16:37.060
"Those who are eager
to surpass others...

16:37.095 --> 16:39.172
...call others names and beat others.

16:39.207 --> 16:41.215
will be driven out of the temple. "

16:41.250 --> 16:44.320
You know it,
but why did you violate the rule?

16:44.355 --> 16:46.810
From now on,
you are no longer a disciple.

16:46.845 --> 16:49.177
...of the Shaolin Temple.

16:49.212 --> 16:51.510
Leave here right now.

16:54.070 --> 16:55.455
Master Sengzhi.

16:55.490 --> 16:58.430
Please, Master Sengzhi,
please forgive me.

16:58.465 --> 17:00.395
- Master.
- No.

17:00.430 --> 17:03.320
A temple should have
its rules as a country does.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.051
The Shaolin Temple.

17:05.087 --> 17:06.714
...is one of decency.

17:06.750 --> 17:11.849
There would be nationwide disorder
if we violate the rules.

17:11.885 --> 17:13.530
Master!

17:14.160 --> 17:17.135
I beg you.
I know I was wrong.

17:17.170 --> 17:20.075
Give me another chance, master.

17:20.109 --> 17:22.710
- I'm afraid that won't do.
- Master!

17:23.619 --> 17:25.635
Master, Master.

17:25.670 --> 17:29.095
Okay, I'll give you another chance.

17:29.130 --> 17:31.410
Go to the discipline court
to get your punishment.

17:31.445 --> 17:33.590
Thank you, master.
Thank you, master.

17:33.625 --> 17:34.970
Thank you, master.

18:06.450 --> 18:08.860
Sengrui, you're doing it wrong.

18:08.895 --> 18:10.630
Yes, master.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.730
We'll see if any of you dare to
violate the rules of the temple.

18:15.765 --> 18:17.530
DISCIPLINE COURT

18:17.890 --> 18:19.245
Yao Hanwu!

18:19.280 --> 18:20.565
Yes, master.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.190
Do the posture
of "crouching tiger" a thousand times.

18:23.225 --> 18:25.280
Not one time less.

18:25.940 --> 18:28.520
Master, that would be too severe.

18:29.070 --> 18:32.030
Sengrui, do you want
to be punished again?

18:33.980 --> 18:36.610
Master, what is
the "crouching tiger"?

18:36.645 --> 18:39.115
- Sengli!
- Master.

18:39.150 --> 18:41.830
- Show him how to do it.
- Yes.

18:59.190 --> 19:01.290
Do you know what to do?

19:02.260 --> 19:05.395
- Yes, I do.
- Then start now.

19:05.430 --> 19:08.570
If you do it wrong once,
you have to do it 10 more times.

19:08.605 --> 19:10.700
Yes, master.

19:21.690 --> 19:23.280
Abbot.

19:23.550 --> 19:25.655
Some soldiers are here to see you.

19:25.690 --> 19:28.840
- Why are they here?
- For an escaped criminal.

19:45.410 --> 19:48.970
Abbot, I heard a criminal
named Fang Lei is in your temple.

19:49.005 --> 19:50.587
We were ordered to catch him.

19:50.622 --> 19:52.251
What crime did he commit?

19:52.286 --> 19:53.845
He is a very cruel man.

19:53.880 --> 19:56.305
He ran away after
he wounded King Chu.

19:56.340 --> 19:58.730
Do you have
an arrest warrant or badge?

20:05.020 --> 20:08.360
Almsgiver, how do you know
he's in the temple?

20:08.395 --> 20:10.610
Before he ran away,
he told his friends.

20:10.645 --> 20:12.912
...he would come here to learn kung fu.

20:12.947 --> 20:15.323
...and then get revenge on King Chu.

20:15.358 --> 20:17.700
So then,
we came all the way here...

20:17.735 --> 20:20.030
...so please be cooperative.

20:55.780 --> 20:58.680
So tired. So tired.

21:00.620 --> 21:02.050
So tired.

21:03.290 --> 21:04.790
I can't belive.

21:04.860 --> 21:07.670
...how good it feels
to lie on my stomach.

21:08.620 --> 21:11.090
It feels good, doesn't it?

21:11.125 --> 21:14.645
Master, I now know

21:14.680 --> 21:17.490
It's quite nice to lie on the stomach.

21:17.525 --> 21:20.240
- And not move at all.
- Is it?

21:21.210 --> 21:23.255
Get up!

21:23.290 --> 21:25.290
Yes yes, master.

21:32.190 --> 21:34.570
- Master.
- All right!

21:35.380 --> 21:36.975
I punished you.

21:37.010 --> 21:38.870
...because I wanted you
to remember these lessons.

21:38.905 --> 21:39.835
Yes.

21:39.870 --> 21:42.415
Yes, I understand.

21:42.450 --> 21:45.860
Why you don't go back
to the garden and do your job?

21:45.895 --> 21:47.860
Yes, master.

22:02.780 --> 22:04.065
Abbot.

22:04.100 --> 22:05.860
Are all of the disciples
of the temple are here?

22:05.895 --> 22:09.520
Amitabha.
They are all here.

22:11.530 --> 22:13.620
He is not among them.

22:13.690 --> 22:16.820
Abbot, think carefully,
have you forgotten anyone?

22:18.500 --> 22:20.490
Hurry hurry,
abbot is waiting for us.

22:31.640 --> 22:34.050
Hey, abbot's waiting for us.

22:34.085 --> 22:36.575
Zhishou, listen to me.

22:36.610 --> 22:38.655
Since I haven't taken the tonsure...

22:38.690 --> 22:41.440
I'm not really a disciple,
so I don't have to go.

22:41.475 --> 22:43.315
What you say it true...

22:43.350 --> 22:46.860
...but you're one of us
when you're staying in the temple.

22:46.895 --> 22:49.785
I am one of you. I...

22:49.820 --> 22:52.700
I am one of you,
but you won't teach me kung fu!

22:52.735 --> 22:54.820
I have to water vegetables
all clay long.

22:54.855 --> 22:56.930
Uh, well...

22:58.780 --> 23:00.075
- Zhishou.
- Huh?

23:00.110 --> 23:02.075
My stomach hurts, Zhishou.

23:02.110 --> 23:05.950
I have to go to the bathroom, Zhishou.
I'm gonna go now.

23:11.450 --> 23:14.085
Could my men and I stay
in the temple overnight?

23:14.120 --> 23:17.470
We'd like to question
all the monks in the temple carefully.

23:17.505 --> 23:20.300
- Uh...
- Amitabha.

23:20.680 --> 23:24.010
I'm afraid it's not convenient for us
to lodge you since we're all Buddhists.

23:24.045 --> 23:26.235
We work for the court.

23:26.270 --> 23:30.550
I think we can stay in the temple
whether or not you agree.

23:30.585 --> 23:32.415
Ah. Sengzhi...

23:32.450 --> 23:36.260
...go prepare the guest rooms.

23:36.690 --> 23:38.420
Yes.

23:39.150 --> 23:40.240
Move!

23:53.960 --> 23:57.890
Who could the murderer be?

23:59.500 --> 24:01.225
He's unidentified.

24:01.260 --> 24:03.695
If he was the one they are looking for...

24:03.730 --> 24:06.180
...he will bring disaster to our temple.

24:06.215 --> 24:08.630
- Do you have evidence?
- Evidence?

24:08.665 --> 24:10.562
I have a lot of evidence.

24:10.597 --> 24:12.425
When he came to our temple...

24:12.460 --> 24:15.020
I felt he didn't come
to convert to Buddhism.

24:15.055 --> 24:17.450
He often practiced kung fu at midnight.

24:17.485 --> 24:19.975
He almost choked me to death once!

24:20.010 --> 24:23.510
- I'm afraid that if he's that guy...
- Oh, Zhishou...

24:23.545 --> 24:25.832
...how can you tell
a good man from a bad man.

24:25.867 --> 24:28.085
...according to the standards
of the court?

24:28.120 --> 24:32.610
They run riot,
but they call the people "rebels. "

24:34.390 --> 24:35.915
Do you really think.

24:35.950 --> 24:39.490
Yao Hanwu is a very good man
or a very bad man?

24:39.870 --> 24:42.285
- Well...
- Tell me the truth.

24:42.320 --> 24:45.690
Master, I actually don't think
he's a bad man.

24:45.725 --> 24:48.970
Then you should help him to do good.

24:49.005 --> 24:50.430
But...

25:32.630 --> 25:35.205
Eh, that's weird.

25:35.240 --> 25:38.160
It feels as if I'm being followed.

25:43.070 --> 25:45.820
Hey! Who's there?

25:57.250 --> 26:00.240
Don't try to hide!
I know you're there!

26:04.560 --> 26:07.190
Yao Hanwu, are you behind me?

26:07.225 --> 26:09.870
I haven't done anything.

26:33.520 --> 26:36.280
I'm quite good at kung fu!

27:13.260 --> 27:15.475
You bully me every day.

27:15.510 --> 27:19.020
Now master wants me to help you.
No way.

27:21.230 --> 27:23.950
I hate you so much I want to kick you.

27:29.580 --> 27:31.550
You made me lose sleep.

28:07.810 --> 28:09.910
- What are you doing here?
- Is this the guy?

28:09.945 --> 28:11.850
Yes, it's him.

28:11.885 --> 28:13.005
Huh.

28:13.040 --> 28:15.030
It took us quite some time to find you.

28:15.065 --> 28:16.685
It turns out you hid here.

28:16.720 --> 28:19.470
- I don't know you.
- Catch him fast.

28:51.090 --> 28:52.790
Hey hey.

29:02.930 --> 29:05.190
Stop him now!

29:25.330 --> 29:27.500
Quiet down there!

29:56.020 --> 29:57.810
- Let's go!
- Let's get him!

29:57.845 --> 29:59.210
Let's go.

31:24.880 --> 31:27.070
What are you doing? Ow.

31:28.950 --> 31:31.110
- Huh? Who are you?
- I'll hit you!

31:34.630 --> 31:37.190
- How dare you hit me!
- And I'll do it again.

31:37.225 --> 31:39.620
- I'll get you!
- Come here.

31:39.655 --> 31:41.470
I'll get you!

32:13.430 --> 32:15.360
H-hey hey, hey hey hey-

32:17.030 --> 32:19.260
Hey... Hey, why don't you move?

32:22.130 --> 32:24.770
Oh, I beat him to death.

32:26.230 --> 32:27.590
Uh-Oh.

32:29.310 --> 32:32.690
Oh, oh my God, oh my God.
What should I do?

32:33.980 --> 32:35.360
Gotcha!

32:38.210 --> 32:39.950
I got him, I got him!

32:39.985 --> 32:41.180
Cover him!

32:47.100 --> 32:49.430
Squeeze him down.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.625
Oh, get off of me!

32:52.660 --> 32:54.675
Squeeze him so he won't get away.

32:54.710 --> 32:56.655
Do you really think Yao Hanwu.

32:56.690 --> 32:59.420
...is a very good man or a very bad man?

32:59.455 --> 33:01.905
- Well...
- Tell me the truth.

33:01.940 --> 33:05.430
Master, I actually
don't think he's a bad man.

33:05.465 --> 33:09.140
Then you should
help him to do good.

33:10.830 --> 33:12.420
I'm here to help you!

33:28.430 --> 33:29.900
I didn't expect to be this good!

33:36.240 --> 33:37.500
Oh, hit us again!

33:37.580 --> 33:39.200
Try hitting us again!

33:39.660 --> 33:42.905
- You can fight, right? Hit us.
- Okay, that's enough.

33:42.940 --> 33:45.950
Don't beat him to death.
We better leave since we've caught him.

33:45.985 --> 33:47.965
- Tie him up.
- Yes.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.490
We'll get into trouble
if the other monks come.

33:53.460 --> 33:55.250
Move it!
Hurry up!

33:55.330 --> 33:56.630
Move.

33:56.700 --> 33:57.690
Walk.

34:22.989 --> 34:24.679
What now?

34:28.730 --> 34:30.420
What should I do now?

34:31.239 --> 34:32.645
No, I have to...

34:32.679 --> 34:34.949
I have to go help him!

34:39.389 --> 34:42.040
Move quickly.
Hurry up!

34:46.710 --> 34:47.969
Hurry up.

34:50.280 --> 34:52.110
Hey! Don't you hear me?

34:55.790 --> 34:58.450
Hurry up. Hurry up.

34:58.520 --> 35:00.820
Don't play dead. Now get up.

35:00.890 --> 35:02.620
- Hurry up!
- Get up.

35:02.655 --> 35:04.907
You're only delaying us.

35:04.942 --> 35:07.160
- Get up already.
- Get up!

35:07.195 --> 35:08.525
Bastard.

35:08.560 --> 35:11.140
- We have to go.
- Get up.

35:13.240 --> 35:15.540
- Idiot!
- He's playing dead.

35:15.575 --> 35:18.550
Get up.
Do you hear me?

35:18.585 --> 35:20.370
Get up.

35:20.860 --> 35:23.145
Get up, loser.
Let's go.

35:23.180 --> 35:25.395
Do you hear me?
Get up.

35:25.430 --> 35:27.120
- Come on.
- Come on. Get up.

35:27.155 --> 35:28.370
Get up.

35:30.220 --> 35:31.190
Who is it?

35:33.360 --> 35:35.220
Who's there?

35:35.290 --> 35:37.590
You two go over there.
And you two, go search there.

35:37.660 --> 35:39.930
- Yes sir.
- Yeah. Come out.

35:41.370 --> 35:43.340
Come out! I've seen you.

35:47.240 --> 35:48.900
Hey, there's no one here.

35:48.980 --> 35:52.470
- Go search there. Go.
- Over there!

35:53.680 --> 35:54.980
Come out!

35:56.020 --> 35:58.070
- Come out.
- Come out.

35:59.150 --> 36:00.410
Get up.

36:01.600 --> 36:02.665
SUN RISE PUB

36:02.700 --> 36:06.050
Waiter!
Waiter, come over here quickly.

36:06.860 --> 36:09.330
Why are you so slow?
Have a drink, Captain.

36:09.365 --> 36:11.530
- Okay, thanks.
- Yeah yeah.

36:14.370 --> 36:17.270
Fill your cups.
The liquor and food here is really good.

36:17.305 --> 36:19.020
I'm thirsty.

36:20.570 --> 36:23.000
Oh, we haven't eaten
like this in months.

36:23.035 --> 36:25.250
- Drink, come on.
- Okay!

36:25.285 --> 36:26.355
Captain, cheers.

36:26.390 --> 36:27.985
- Yeah, cheers!
- Drink up.

36:28.020 --> 36:30.600
- Oh, good stuff.
- Cheers cheers.

36:32.590 --> 36:34.335
Ah, this tastes great.

36:34.370 --> 36:37.710
Waiter, two more jars of liquor
and two more steaks.

36:39.930 --> 36:42.330
Ha, yeah.

36:43.360 --> 36:46.230
Are you hungry, huh?

36:46.300 --> 36:48.460
The bone is delicious. Try it.

36:48.530 --> 36:51.000
Come on, eat it. Eat. Come on.

36:51.070 --> 36:53.000
Don't offend me. Eat it, eat.

36:53.070 --> 36:55.060
Eat it.
It's delicious.

36:55.140 --> 36:57.300
Do you want to starve?

36:57.380 --> 36:59.240
Eat, come on already.
Come on.

36:59.310 --> 37:01.800
Eat this!

37:04.320 --> 37:05.580
How dare you?

37:06.620 --> 37:07.920
Bastard!

37:07.990 --> 37:09.510
Yeah!

37:09.590 --> 37:11.350
You're not a real monk, eat!

37:11.420 --> 37:12.390
- Eat.
- Eat it.

37:12.460 --> 37:15.050
- Don't want to eat, huh?
- Huh-uh.

37:15.130 --> 37:16.790
I'll stuff it down your throat!

37:16.860 --> 37:19.800
- Eat! Eat it!
- You don't have the guts to untie me!

37:19.870 --> 37:22.030
You don't want to eat?

37:22.100 --> 37:24.110
Then I'll feed it to the dog.

37:28.670 --> 37:31.800
You refuse to eat something?
You'll die of hunger.

37:31.880 --> 37:34.780
- Who cares?
- No no no, don't mind him.

37:34.850 --> 37:37.840
Hurry up and finish eating.
We have a long way to walk.

37:37.920 --> 37:40.390
We have to get to Huangji
by the evening.

37:40.450 --> 37:42.550
Okay, he's right.

37:42.620 --> 37:45.110
Cheers!

37:45.190 --> 37:46.920
- Cheers.
- Oh, this is so good.

37:46.990 --> 37:48.620
Cheers.

37:49.570 --> 37:55.500
LING MING INN

37:57.490 --> 37:59.505
- Waiter!
- Yes.

37:59.540 --> 38:01.480
- Come on. Come on. Hurry, waiter!
- Yes, I am coming.

38:01.515 --> 38:03.420
- Bring us liquor.
- Yes, I will do it right away.

38:03.455 --> 38:05.647
Please come in.
Please have a seat.

38:05.682 --> 38:07.840
The dishes will be ready in a minute.

38:07.875 --> 38:09.840
- Hurry up!
- Yes yes yes.

38:11.480 --> 38:13.680
- Take your seats.
- Come on, take your seats.

38:13.750 --> 38:15.880
- Sit down, I'm exhausted.
- Me too.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.070
Looks like he's having a good time.

38:19.290 --> 38:21.245
Oh yeah, he is.

38:21.280 --> 38:22.930
- Hey, that beefs mine. Fine.
- Mm-hmm.

38:22.965 --> 38:24.710
Bring me another beer.

38:25.630 --> 38:27.760
- I'm exhausted. Are you?
- That guy was tough!

38:27.830 --> 38:29.490
- Yeah, he was.
- Did you hear that?

38:29.570 --> 38:31.560
- Listen! Shh.
- I don't hear anything.

38:31.640 --> 38:33.200
I think he's had too much to drink.

38:33.270 --> 38:34.330
Check out the look on his face.

38:34.410 --> 38:36.030
I can't believe we had
to come all the way here.

38:37.610 --> 38:38.870
Pass me that plate.

38:44.980 --> 38:46.470
I'm tired.

38:46.550 --> 38:47.880
- Who has the bottle?
- I do.

38:47.950 --> 38:50.050
I thought we just said
that we drank enough, guys.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.610
- Let's slow down.
- It's your wine.

38:51.690 --> 38:53.780
All right.

38:55.230 --> 38:56.850
Wait wait wait.
I want some too.

38:56.930 --> 38:58.420
God, you guys are alcoholics.

38:58.500 --> 38:59.960
I'm going out.

39:00.030 --> 39:01.800
You stay here, keep drinking.

39:01.870 --> 39:03.770
I am gonna out for a while too.

39:03.840 --> 39:05.130
- Come back fast.
- Okay.

39:06.740 --> 39:08.300
Come on, let's drink.

39:35.070 --> 39:37.090
Leave me alone.

39:38.470 --> 39:39.960
I'm pissing.

39:53.120 --> 39:54.380
Take that!

40:06.830 --> 40:08.890
Oh, that was dangerous.

40:08.970 --> 40:10.830
Hey...

40:10.900 --> 40:13.960
I really wish I had taken
my master's lessons seriously.

40:15.370 --> 40:17.930
But you jnow what?

40:19.410 --> 40:20.740
That was pretty easy.

40:28.920 --> 40:31.080
- Who are you?
- I'm your grandfather.

40:40.830 --> 40:42.730
What took you so long?

40:42.800 --> 40:46.290
Sit down and drink.
Don't just stand there.

40:46.370 --> 40:48.740
- You're mistaken.
- Zhishou!

40:50.810 --> 40:52.070
You bold monk.

40:52.140 --> 40:56.440
Do you want to die?
Go and t-tie him up.

40:56.520 --> 40:57.570
Yes sir.

40:58.620 --> 41:00.410
Hey, idiot.

41:14.070 --> 41:16.590
- Zhishou, Zhishou, come here.
- Come back here!

41:16.670 --> 41:19.070
Don't fight with him.
Come here and untie me.

41:19.140 --> 41:21.370
I'll get you!

41:21.440 --> 41:23.770
How dare you!

41:26.450 --> 41:27.500
Zhishou!

41:28.750 --> 41:30.740
Come untie me, hurry up.

41:30.820 --> 41:33.150
The rope is too tight.
I can't untie it.

41:33.220 --> 41:34.550
You want to untie it?

41:41.760 --> 41:43.750
Untie me.

41:43.830 --> 41:46.800
- Zhishou, why are you here?
- Why do you think I'm here?

41:46.870 --> 41:49.130
- To rescue you.
- Thank you, Zhishou.

41:49.200 --> 41:52.300
Don't talk so much, all right?
Let's just get out of here.

41:52.370 --> 41:54.640
- Come on.
- Go go!

41:56.810 --> 41:58.155
Take guard!
Intruders are entering the temple!

41:58.190 --> 41:59.500
Take guard!
Intruders are entering the temple!

42:09.320 --> 42:10.550
Amitabha.

42:10.620 --> 42:12.180
Hand Fang Lei over to me.

42:14.260 --> 42:15.590
I'm sorry...

42:15.660 --> 42:17.360
...there is no such person in our temple.

42:17.430 --> 42:19.690
Fang Lei works
in the garden of the temple.

42:19.770 --> 42:21.390
...and goes by the name of Yao Hanwu.

42:23.070 --> 42:25.760
Almsgiver,
Yao Hanwu disappeared.

42:25.840 --> 42:27.600
...since you came here last time.

42:27.670 --> 42:29.470
Don't lie to me.

42:29.540 --> 42:31.530
A monk from your temple
wounded a soldier.

42:31.610 --> 42:34.410
...and then took away Fang Lei,
or Yao Hanwu.

42:34.480 --> 42:36.310
Hand the two over to me.

42:36.380 --> 42:39.940
Almsgiver, I know nothing
about what you said.

42:40.020 --> 42:42.110
I can do nothing about it.

42:42.190 --> 42:44.820
I knew you wouldn't
hand them over to me.

42:44.890 --> 42:47.790
Very well.
I'll search for them myself.

43:15.550 --> 43:18.550
- Stop it.
- Either you hand Fang Lei over to me...

43:18.620 --> 43:21.320
- Or you can watch me kill this monk.
- Don't act foolishly.

43:24.130 --> 43:26.100
Amitabha.

43:27.170 --> 43:30.140
Almsgiver,
we can talk peacefully.

43:30.200 --> 43:31.970
Don't hurt my disciples.

43:32.040 --> 43:33.870
The old monk,
you come at last.

44:14.210 --> 44:15.940
- Hey, look who's here.
- Be quiet, be quiet!

44:16.020 --> 44:17.280
Be quiet, they're here.

44:19.020 --> 44:21.750
Abbot, you violate the law knowingly.

44:21.820 --> 44:25.090
Almsgiver,
I really do not know

44:25.160 --> 44:26.950
who did it.

44:28.690 --> 44:30.790
Sengzhi, do you know who did it?

44:30.860 --> 44:32.960
It might be Zhishou.

44:33.030 --> 44:34.520
Where are they now?

44:35.600 --> 44:38.160
Abbot! Abbot!

44:39.970 --> 44:42.530
Abbot, I know where they are.

44:42.610 --> 44:45.200
- Where?
- They came back last night.

44:45.280 --> 44:48.180
- Where are they now?
- They said that they got in trouble.

44:48.250 --> 44:49.910
...and they felt sorry for abbot...

44:49.980 --> 44:52.040
...so they headed
for Luoyang last night.

44:52.120 --> 44:53.880
Abbot, this is the letter
they left for you.

45:10.670 --> 45:12.660
This is the letter he left for you?

45:12.740 --> 45:14.210
Uh...

45:17.680 --> 45:19.300
- It is.
- Okay...

45:19.380 --> 45:21.070
we'll go to Luoyang then.

45:22.110 --> 45:24.780
Abbot, if you don't report
when he comes back...

45:24.850 --> 45:26.880
...it is a serious crime!

45:26.950 --> 45:28.010
Let's go.

45:43.400 --> 45:46.770
Daoguang,
what on earth is this?

45:48.740 --> 45:50.140
Abbot...

45:51.880 --> 45:54.470
...my last name is Fang
and my first name is Lei.

45:55.610 --> 45:57.450
I'm from Jinzhou.

45:57.520 --> 46:00.780
My sister was a concubine
of King Chu Zhu Can.

46:02.690 --> 46:05.180
I lived in the palace
with my sister in my childhood.

46:05.260 --> 46:08.320
I was Zhu Can's servant in his study.

46:09.560 --> 46:11.120
But...

46:11.200 --> 46:12.600
...one day...

46:16.400 --> 46:19.300
Oh, sweetheart,
don't run away from me.

46:19.370 --> 46:22.530
- Your Highness.
- Come here, don't run away from me.

46:22.610 --> 46:23.800
Come here.

46:24.910 --> 46:26.710
Ah, my darling.

46:30.920 --> 46:33.280
My sweet girl,
you're so beautiful.

46:33.350 --> 46:35.910
I really do love you.

46:40.730 --> 46:42.280
Hey.

46:42.360 --> 46:44.760
Don't leave, my beauty.
Come here.

46:44.830 --> 46:46.630
Come over here,
come here.

46:46.700 --> 46:48.670
Oh stop it.

46:55.540 --> 46:56.510
Stop!

46:57.840 --> 46:59.310
Your Highness?

46:59.380 --> 47:01.370
What is this food?

47:03.180 --> 47:04.710
Your Highness, it's venison.

47:04.780 --> 47:07.010
You give me venison every day!

47:07.090 --> 47:08.990
I'm sick of it.
You know that?

47:09.050 --> 47:10.850
- Get the hell out of here!
- Your Highness.

47:10.920 --> 47:13.020
- Uh...
- Don't be angry.

47:13.090 --> 47:15.650
He's my brother,
so he's your brother-in-law.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.730
That's fine then, my boy.

47:19.800 --> 47:22.770
You can take it away
and eat it. Go away.

47:22.840 --> 47:24.630
Get out of here now.

47:30.080 --> 47:32.440
- Your Highness.
- Listen, sweetheart.

47:32.510 --> 47:34.810
- Huh?
- Do you know...

47:34.880 --> 47:36.850
what's the most delicious food
in the world?

47:38.580 --> 47:40.450
The liver of a dragon?

47:40.520 --> 47:43.450
Well, that's just a legend.

47:44.760 --> 47:47.380
Umm, tiger or bear paw?

47:47.460 --> 47:48.690
Incorrect.

47:50.030 --> 47:52.900
And bird's nest or shark's fin?

47:52.970 --> 47:54.630
Ha ha.
Incorrect.

47:54.700 --> 47:57.030
Eh, guess again.

47:57.100 --> 47:58.830
Mmm. Your Highness...

47:58.900 --> 48:00.300
I have little talent and education.

48:00.370 --> 48:02.770
I can't guess it.

48:03.810 --> 48:07.680
Fang Xia,
to tell you the truth...

48:10.350 --> 48:11.480
...it's human flesh.

48:12.750 --> 48:14.080
You're joking.

48:14.150 --> 48:17.280
I've never heard
of anyone eating human flesh before.

48:18.320 --> 48:20.190
Well, it's delicious.

48:20.260 --> 48:23.390
Would you be willing
to be my food?

48:25.030 --> 48:29.060
Your Highness, since you love me
so much, I'd be happy.

48:29.130 --> 48:31.690
...to be your food.
What do you think?

48:34.370 --> 48:35.970
Okay.

48:36.040 --> 48:38.870
Your skin is smooth
and your flesh is...

48:38.940 --> 48:40.410
...tender.

48:40.480 --> 48:41.740
It'd be a pity if I didn't eat you.

48:45.320 --> 48:46.650
Guards.

48:47.850 --> 48:50.120
What do you require of us?

48:50.190 --> 48:53.350
- Your Highness, stop kidding.
- Take her away and boil her.

48:55.960 --> 48:58.050
- Why are you just standing there?
- Your Highness...

48:58.130 --> 49:02.070
...please forgive me.
I was only joking just now.

49:02.130 --> 49:06.040
There's no kidding with a king.
How can you joke with me? Huh?

49:06.100 --> 49:09.540
Your Highness,
forgive me for making a joke.

49:09.610 --> 49:12.510
Ehh, you'll be my dinner.
Take her away.

49:13.810 --> 49:15.010
- Let's go.
- Come here!

49:15.080 --> 49:16.240
- Your Highness.
- Come, let's go. Come on!

49:16.320 --> 49:17.910
- Come! Come here.
- Your Highness!

49:17.980 --> 49:19.110
Take her!

49:19.180 --> 49:20.740
Your Highness!

49:24.960 --> 49:27.760
I'll treat you to a delicious dish.

49:29.590 --> 49:32.290
I'll promote those who can
guess what meat it is.

49:32.360 --> 49:34.700
...and I'll give those
who have high rankings.

49:34.770 --> 49:36.730
1,000 qing in good fields.

49:39.440 --> 49:43.340
Taste the meat, men,
and give me your answer.

49:43.410 --> 49:45.670
It's elephant meat.

49:48.250 --> 49:50.080
Wrong.

49:52.250 --> 49:54.150
Try again.

49:54.220 --> 49:56.020
Is it the meat of a crane?

49:56.090 --> 49:58.610
Ehh, wrong.

49:58.690 --> 50:01.680
Deer venison,
slaughtered less than 100 days ago.

50:04.130 --> 50:06.190
Wrong again.

50:13.510 --> 50:15.440
Do you know what meat it is?

50:16.880 --> 50:17.900
I have no idea.

50:17.980 --> 50:20.640
You should have a taste.

50:20.710 --> 50:22.740
It's your sister's flesh.

50:30.790 --> 50:33.660
Am I good to you or what? Huh?

50:33.730 --> 50:36.630
I had my wife to treat you all.

50:36.700 --> 50:39.030
Look how generous I am.

50:39.100 --> 50:42.120
I boiled my very own wife to treat you.

50:45.700 --> 50:48.800
You beast!
I'll kill you. You beast.

50:53.180 --> 50:55.980
How dare you eat my sister?
I'll kill you.

50:56.050 --> 50:58.680
I'll kill you.
I'll kill you.

51:03.390 --> 51:05.290
You... You beast!

51:05.360 --> 51:06.720
I'll kill you.

51:06.790 --> 51:09.350
- Take him away!
- Yes sir!

51:20.940 --> 51:22.870
He is very cruel.

51:24.780 --> 51:26.870
Amitabha!

51:26.950 --> 51:29.410
It is sinful. It is sinful.

52:03.650 --> 52:05.640
Hey, what are you doing?

52:14.960 --> 52:16.330
Are you crazy or what?

52:34.980 --> 52:36.210
Hey!

52:43.020 --> 52:45.490
You'll get sick
if you keep doing this.

52:45.560 --> 52:47.620
Why are you so stubborn?
It's freezing!

52:47.690 --> 52:50.160
Actually, I think
you're already sick in the head.

52:50.230 --> 52:51.200
You're useless!

52:52.460 --> 52:53.430
Useless.

53:32.740 --> 53:33.700
Master Caitou.

53:38.580 --> 53:40.940
Master Caitou,
what are you going to do?

53:41.010 --> 53:43.980
Why didn't you cover
the water jars after you filled them?

53:45.720 --> 53:47.340
Yes, master.

53:52.820 --> 53:53.790
Cather!

54:33.900 --> 54:34.870
That's not fair.

54:37.940 --> 54:39.600
There are still
four water jars not covered.

54:39.670 --> 54:41.940
Your kung fu needs practice!
Let's go!

54:44.940 --> 54:46.270
Yes, master!

54:59.620 --> 55:01.350
Abbot, there is an official coming.

55:01.430 --> 55:02.890
What do they want to do this time?

55:02.960 --> 55:06.020
- He wants to worship the Buddha.
- Worship the Buddha?

55:07.430 --> 55:09.230
Do they come.

55:09.300 --> 55:11.130
...to worship the Buddha.

55:11.200 --> 55:13.400
while they kill and fight
in front of him?

55:13.470 --> 55:16.460
I agree, master.
Could it be a trick?

55:32.160 --> 55:33.560
Amitabha.

55:34.890 --> 55:36.160
What?

55:40.670 --> 55:42.630
Amitabha!

55:45.040 --> 55:47.230
I am General Zhu Can.

55:47.310 --> 55:50.500
I am abbot of the Shaolin Temple.

55:50.580 --> 55:55.210
My name is Zhichao. I am sorry that
I didn't greet you when you arrived.

55:55.280 --> 55:57.580
It's okay okay okay.

55:59.150 --> 56:01.680
Abbot, the Shaolin Temple.

56:01.750 --> 56:05.590
...is very very famous around the empire.

56:07.790 --> 56:09.660
But...

56:09.730 --> 56:10.890
why...

56:12.460 --> 56:14.730
why are there so many refugees?

56:14.800 --> 56:17.860
The Shaolin Temple is
becoming a refugee camp.

56:19.670 --> 56:22.500
Almsgiver,
you do not know the situation.

56:22.570 --> 56:26.140
- Oh? Explain.
- People have suffered a lot.

56:26.210 --> 56:29.270
...because of wars and drought.

56:30.480 --> 56:33.970
There is no food
for the poor people to harvest...

56:34.050 --> 56:37.490
...and therefore our temple decides
to help those poor people.

56:40.630 --> 56:43.060
Oh, almsgiver...

56:43.130 --> 56:44.490
...you were predestined by Buddha.

56:45.530 --> 56:46.790
It is true.

56:46.870 --> 56:50.670
When I was in my childhood,
an old monk helped me out.

56:50.740 --> 56:54.360
whenever I stole something from others.

56:54.440 --> 56:56.740
Therefore I believed
in Buddha from then on.

56:56.810 --> 56:59.140
- Oh.
- Yes, and now I know

56:59.210 --> 57:01.540
I am on the right path.

57:03.420 --> 57:05.080
That's good.

57:08.020 --> 57:09.490
Huh? Is something wrong?

57:13.630 --> 57:14.790
Don't you move!

57:14.860 --> 57:16.950
Almsgiver,
do you know my disciple?

57:17.030 --> 57:18.790
More than that.

57:18.860 --> 57:20.760
He's my brother-in-law.

57:20.830 --> 57:23.890
- Oh, is that true?
- Of course it's true!

57:23.970 --> 57:25.730
Hey, Fang Lei...

57:25.800 --> 57:28.070
...come over here.

57:28.140 --> 57:31.070
You beast! I would rather die here
than go back with you!

57:32.510 --> 57:35.780
Come on,
I treat you like a brother...

57:35.850 --> 57:38.370
...but you betray me
and curse me in my presence.

57:38.450 --> 57:40.710
Not only do I curse you...

57:40.790 --> 57:43.020
...but I would kill you!

57:46.320 --> 57:48.120
Hold him. Hold him!

57:49.660 --> 57:51.150
Are you crazy, boy?

57:51.230 --> 57:54.860
I have been searching for you
ever since you ran away.

57:54.930 --> 57:56.990
You beast,
you're the crazy one.

57:57.070 --> 58:00.230
- Yao Hanwu, don't be rude!
- No-oo!

58:00.310 --> 58:03.070
I will kill him to avenge
my sister's death.

58:03.140 --> 58:05.440
Your sister?

58:05.510 --> 58:08.500
...is my beloved concubine
whom I love very much.

58:08.580 --> 58:10.100
How could I kill her?

58:10.180 --> 58:12.150
You're a liar!

58:12.220 --> 58:14.010
If you really loved her...

58:14.090 --> 58:16.080
...how could you eat her?

58:16.150 --> 58:18.680
Come on, she volunteered
to be my food!

58:18.760 --> 58:22.120
You're a mad man!
No one would be willing to be eaten.

58:22.190 --> 58:25.390
It was true. If you don't believe me,
you can ask her.

58:25.460 --> 58:28.020
She is dead;
how could I ask her?

58:28.100 --> 58:31.070
You bastard!
I will kill you today!

58:35.510 --> 58:36.910
Damn you. Boy!

58:36.980 --> 58:40.210
I only show you kindness,
but you insult me in public.

58:40.280 --> 58:41.800
I'll fight!

58:41.880 --> 58:43.610
Why don't you and I settle this now?

58:46.380 --> 58:49.290
It is sinful, it's sinful.

58:49.350 --> 58:51.290
Guards, take him back!

58:51.360 --> 58:52.820
- You monster!
- Move.

58:54.030 --> 58:55.080
Hold on!

58:57.830 --> 59:00.590
Almsgiver,
don't you believe in Buddha?

59:00.670 --> 59:02.430
He is also a disciple of Buddha.

59:02.500 --> 59:05.990
Please forgive him
and let him stay here.

59:06.070 --> 59:07.900
I can't do that.

59:07.970 --> 59:11.530
I promised his sister
that I would look after him.

59:11.610 --> 59:13.270
I should keep my word.

59:13.340 --> 59:16.540
Therefore I must bring him back.

59:18.250 --> 59:21.120
Abbot, can you stop me?

59:21.190 --> 59:22.910
If you can't...

59:22.990 --> 59:24.580
I will take him back.

59:24.660 --> 59:26.420
- Well...
- Abbot...

59:26.490 --> 59:28.980
I would like to try on behalf
of the Shaolin Temple.

59:30.400 --> 59:31.360
Okay.

59:32.400 --> 59:33.360
Captain!

59:34.630 --> 59:35.600
General!

59:37.040 --> 59:38.500
Please.

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:11.860
Oh, it hurts! It hurts!

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:15.700
- Amitabha.
- Amitabha.

01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:17.370
You are so useless!

01:00:18.810 --> 01:00:20.540
Almsgiver,
please don't do that!

01:00:36.030 --> 01:00:37.460
Almsgiver!

01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:44.630
Amitabha.

01:00:59.550 --> 01:01:02.140
How can you bite me?

01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:03.850
Don't offend me,
you stupid monk.

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:07.190
If you do,
I will eat your flesh.

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:12.060
Abbot...

01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:16.530
I told you,
if you can hide an escaped criminal...

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:19.000
...you're committing a serious crime.

01:01:19.070 --> 01:01:22.100
If you don't let me take him with me...

01:01:22.170 --> 01:01:25.970
...think of the consequences.

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.980
...for the whole temple.

01:01:28.050 --> 01:01:30.170
Master, let me go with him.

01:01:30.250 --> 01:01:32.650
- Amitabha.
- No, you can't go.

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:34.480
I am not a disciple.

01:01:34.550 --> 01:01:35.950
I cannot bring troubles here.

01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:38.350
I must go!
I must go with him.

01:01:39.590 --> 01:01:40.750
That's good.

01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:45.320
You should be
as obedient as before, huh?

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.190
Abbot, we can't let them go!

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:48.730
Stop.

01:01:50.970 --> 01:01:54.200
Almsgiver,
if you want to take him away...

01:01:54.270 --> 01:01:56.870
- Promise me one thing.
- What is it?

01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:58.930
Please don't kill him.

01:01:59.010 --> 01:02:01.270
Since both of you believe in Buddhism...

01:02:01.350 --> 01:02:03.180
...you must promise me that.

01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:05.770
- It would be of no use.
- Okay.

01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:07.370
No problem.

01:02:07.450 --> 01:02:09.110
I like him so much.

01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:14.590
How could I kill him?
He is my brother-in-law.

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:17.880
ZHU RESIDENCE

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.900
- Bring him in.
- Yes sir!

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.730
- Come on.
- You beast! Why not kill me?

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:25.460
Come on, Fang Lei.

01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:27.970
Don't take me as your enemy,
brother-in-law.

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:30.940
- Is that really necessary?
- Necessary?

01:02:31.010 --> 01:02:33.530
- Don't you think it is?
- Don't be angry.

01:02:34.810 --> 01:02:36.470
Your sister...

01:02:36.550 --> 01:02:38.640
was willing to be eaten...

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:40.310
...believe it or not.

01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:42.880
Now she and I are in one body.

01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:45.920
We will never part from each other,
for all eternity!

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.950
You disgusting animal.

01:02:49.030 --> 01:02:51.820
You're a real monster!
You're a monster!

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:55.090
- I am...
- I should kill you.

01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:58.030
If anyone else cursed me like that,
I would kill them.

01:02:58.100 --> 01:02:59.830
But not you.

01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:02.700
I will not kill you.
Did you know that?

01:03:02.770 --> 01:03:05.070
You are an exception.

01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:07.810
- Do you know why?
- You're the idiot.

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:09.470
Do you know why?

01:03:09.550 --> 01:03:11.280
I will not kill you...

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:15.780
Because I love you like a pet.
You're an animal to me.

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:19.750
- I would rather die here...
- Watch him.

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:20.810
...than stay with you,
you bastard!

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:25.390
The more you want to die,
the less I want kill you.

01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:35.400
No.

01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:37.700
I cannot stay here.

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:39.900
I should run away.

01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:41.770
I cannot bear that beast insulting me.

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.360
The damned beast.

01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:05.700
He had me shackled.
I must escape.

01:04:17.950 --> 01:04:19.810
Zhu Can, you bastard!

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:22.850
Zhu Can, sooner or later
I will get revenge...

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:24.050
...revenge on you!

01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:33.930
What about Fang Lei?

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.560
I wonder where he is right now.

01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:37.500
Hey, Zhishou, what's this?

01:04:37.570 --> 01:04:39.370
- Master Caitou.
- Why do you worry so much?

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.630
- Uh, I'm not.
- You lazy boy!

01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:44.770
Don't lie to me. How long have
you been washing the vegetables?

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:46.830
Master, don't worry.

01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:49.640
I'll finish soon.
I'm almost clone.

01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:55.380
Look look.
Here they are.

01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:04.760
Master Caitou, do you think
Fang Lei is in danger?

01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:06.920
Since he was
taken away by Zhu Can?

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.900
Why are you asking me?

01:05:08.970 --> 01:05:11.460
I had a dream
about Fang Lei last night.

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:14.160
It really upset me, master.

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:16.930
Ah, of course, I heard.

01:05:17.010 --> 01:05:19.810
That man likes eating human flesh.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:22.350
If Fang Lei dares to offend him...

01:05:22.410 --> 01:05:24.280
I think he's a dead man.

01:05:28.050 --> 01:05:31.250
If he dares touch Fang Lei,
I will kill him.

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:33.310
Come on, boy.

01:05:33.390 --> 01:05:36.880
You can't fight against those officials.
You will definitely be defeated.

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:38.550
No doubt about that.

01:05:39.930 --> 01:05:42.900
Master, it was a joke.
I was only kidding.

01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:44.800
Uh, okay.

01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:46.430
There is no firewood in the oven.
Go add some.

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.130
Yes yes, of course.

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:22.610
You silly boy.

01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:24.610
You can try all you want...

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:26.440
...but you will never break it.

01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:28.070
You swine!
Why did you come here?

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:30.200
Due to the command of His Majesty...

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:32.150
I will be leaving the city.

01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:34.580
...and I won't be back
for several days.

01:06:34.650 --> 01:06:37.120
- You wait here for me.
- You animal.

01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:38.850
You will go to hell for this!

01:06:55.110 --> 01:06:58.410
Brother-in-law,
I will come back to you later.

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:01.540
Once I'm free,
I'll be all yours!

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:05.380
Go.

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:18.720
You beast.

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.590
Crazy lunatic.

01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:22.460
Filthy bastard,
I'll kill you!

01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:30.530
Bastard. Beast!

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:08.110
Why are you fooling around?

01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:09.480
You should water the vegetables.

01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:23.590
Master Caitou, I watched
those brothers practicing with poles.

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:26.790
I learned postures.
The one you used was great!

01:08:26.859 --> 01:08:29.359
Tell me, what is that?

01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:32.370
Which one?
Was it with my left hand.

01:08:32.439 --> 01:08:34.200
...or with my right hand, huh?

01:08:34.270 --> 01:08:35.970
The one where you
smashed the shoulder pole.

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.270
with your hand.
That one.

01:08:38.979 --> 01:08:41.910
Yao Hanwu,
you must concentrate on everything.

01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:44.770
But how is that related to kung fu?

01:08:44.850 --> 01:08:47.680
Like the tree
that grows in the earth...

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:49.979
Zen and kung fu are
growing in your life.

01:08:51.390 --> 01:08:53.790
"Like the tree that
grows in the earth...

01:08:53.859 --> 01:08:56.920
Zen and kung fu are
growing in your life. "

01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:58.359
What does that mean?

01:08:59.830 --> 01:09:03.359
You fool!
Must you think so literally!

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:06.229
Zen and kung fu are in your life.

01:09:12.729 --> 01:09:14.810
Zen and kung fu in my life?

01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:19.680
Wrong!

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:24.779
Ah, so chase!

01:09:24.859 --> 01:09:26.550
I almost got hit.

01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:31.520
How can I get revenge?

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.620
Not like this.

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:36.000
I can't even control an iron ball.

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:41.859
Yes, kung fu...

01:09:41.939 --> 01:09:42.960
...is in my life.

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:54.640
- Hey!
- Huh?

01:10:54.710 --> 01:10:56.180
Mammy-am.

01:10:57.650 --> 01:10:59.740
Master, I'm just practicing kung fu!

01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:03.340
You're famous for being lazy.
Why practice kung fu?

01:11:07.490 --> 01:11:10.720
I suddenly realized that
I should change my way of life.

01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:13.460
- So I can be a good Buddhist.
- Oh, that's great!

01:11:13.530 --> 01:11:15.400
Abbot will be happy when he finds out.

01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:17.330
Amitabha.

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:19.960
It is my duty.
It's not worth mentioning.

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:22.270
Okay, go on practicing then.

01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:23.310
Yes, master.

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.140
- Oh, wait!
- Huh?

01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:36.450
Yes, master. What is it?

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:38.780
Don't forget what you have to do, huh?

01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:40.880
Oh, I remember, master.

01:12:37.150 --> 01:12:39.380
He's a good man.
I must help him.

01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:42.850
He's a good man.
I must help him.

01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:52.260
ZHU RESIDENCE

01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:54.990
ZHU RESIDENCE

01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:01.700
Who is it?

01:13:01.770 --> 01:13:03.570
Amitabha!
Almsgiver.

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:05.200
Little monk, are you blind?

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.870
Do you know where you are?
How dare you come here? Go away!

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:09.540
Hey hey hey, hold on, hold on.

01:13:09.610 --> 01:13:11.840
What's going on?
Do you want to get hurt?

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:14.540
- No, I am looking for a man.
- What's his name?

01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:18.010
- His name is Fang Lei.
- Fang Lei?

01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:21.890
- Uh, yeah.
- He cannot see you.

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:23.620
Almsgiver, is he all right?

01:13:23.690 --> 01:13:25.490
He is the brother-in-law
of General Zhu.

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:27.150
How could anything
be wrong with him?

01:13:27.230 --> 01:13:29.530
Well, if he is fine,
why can't I see him?

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:31.760
I said you can't see him.
Go away!

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:34.825
Hey hey, almsgiver, almsgiver...

01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:37.420
...please please,
let me see him. Please!

01:13:37.455 --> 01:13:39.185
Wait a moment, please.

01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:42.840
Let me see him, please.
Open the door, please.

01:13:42.875 --> 01:13:45.150
I just want to talk to him.

01:13:45.185 --> 01:13:47.560
Open the door, please.

01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:55.940
This residence is huge.

01:13:56.530 --> 01:13:58.310
Fang Lei must be comfortable.

01:13:58.345 --> 01:14:00.372
He's already forgotten me.

01:14:00.407 --> 01:14:02.400
And I was feeling bad for him?

01:14:02.435 --> 01:14:04.245
Lucky little...

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:06.670
All because
I thought he was good.

01:14:06.705 --> 01:14:07.920
I shouldn't have come.

01:14:07.955 --> 01:14:10.270
Now I'm the fool!

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.210
Charge!

01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:51.670
This really is a large residence.

01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:55.570
Fang Lei must have a happy life here.

01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:38.760
How dare you?
How dare you attack me!

01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:06.820
Who are you?

01:16:06.890 --> 01:16:08.650
Tell me now and
tell me what you want.

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:11.390
Wait wait wait wait!

01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:13.330
Wait a minute.
Are you afraid?

01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:14.860
Not at all.

01:16:14.930 --> 01:16:17.630
Can't you recognize my voice?

01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:21.030
Zhishou?

01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:23.200
- Zhishou, it's you.
- Yeah!

01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:25.040
Oh, my neck.

01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:27.740
Wh... why are you so cruel to me?

01:16:27.810 --> 01:16:30.410
Shh shh.
Keep your voice down.

01:16:32.450 --> 01:16:34.820
Why? Aren't you enjoying
a happy life here?

01:16:34.890 --> 01:16:36.380
Why are you creeping around like that?

01:16:36.450 --> 01:16:38.940
Happy life?
What happy life?

01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:40.990
- I'm suffering here.
- Then why not escape?

01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:43.750
Zhishou, I want to escape...

01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:46.820
...but look... Look at this.

01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:49.960
- I'm locked up in here.
- What? Let me see that.

01:16:53.370 --> 01:16:55.000
- Zhishou.
- Huh... Ahh.

01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:04.550
Huh.

01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:09.810
Huh?

01:17:09.890 --> 01:17:12.080
- Wow.
- Zhishou, see what I'm talking about?

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:14.250
Wow, what a large iron ball!

01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:15.620
You're stuck here!

01:17:15.690 --> 01:17:18.750
And I thought you were
enjoying a happy life.

01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:22.190
Time for breakfast!

01:17:27.370 --> 01:17:28.335
How could he escape.

01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:29.300
How could he escape.

01:17:29.370 --> 01:17:31.240
with such a large iron ball tied to him?

01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:33.540
I am confused as well.

01:17:35.210 --> 01:17:37.650
Confused? You fool!

01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:40.370
I'll eat you!

01:17:40.450 --> 01:17:42.320
Please forgive me!

01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:44.550
- Don't eat me!
- We have no time for this.

01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:48.180
Search for him... immediately!

01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:01.660
Assassin!

01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:03.670
There is an assassin!

01:18:10.010 --> 01:18:12.070
Soldiers,
this is none of your business.

01:18:12.150 --> 01:18:15.240
Beat it, all of you!

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:17.340
You're causing trouble here!

01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:20.960
Someone wanted to kill us!

01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:22.820
No one wants to kill us.

01:18:22.890 --> 01:18:26.260
- Just you.
- Huh? What?

01:18:26.330 --> 01:18:27.660
What am I going to do?

01:20:08.630 --> 01:20:09.860
Fang Lei, run!

01:20:10.930 --> 01:20:12.560
What are you, crazy?
Run, quick!

01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:14.000
All right.

01:20:16.170 --> 01:20:19.040
Zhishou, you've been away
from Shaolin Temple.

01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:21.200
without permission for almost 10 days.

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:23.300
Do you know that's wrong?

01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:26.250
- Of course I do.
- Then why did you do it?

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:27.940
I had to do it.

01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:29.750
Fang Lei would've lost his life!

01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:31.690
He can prove it.

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:34.620
Master, what Zhishou said is right.

01:20:34.690 --> 01:20:36.750
He left Shaolin Temple to save me.

01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:39.190
Please punish me for...
for any wrong that he did.

01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:42.630
- All right.
- I will accept whatever you see fit.

01:21:50.330 --> 01:21:51.600
Brother.

01:21:55.770 --> 01:21:57.500
Napkin
Mammy-am.

01:21:57.570 --> 01:22:00.070
I want to learn
the technique of the stick.

01:22:00.140 --> 01:22:01.610
All right!
Take the stick!

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:02.870
Okay.

01:22:04.450 --> 01:22:05.440
All right.

01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:27.660
I want revenge!

01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:32.340
Brother, brother.

01:22:32.410 --> 01:22:34.600
I want revenge!

01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:38.670
- Brother.
- I want revenge!

01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:40.480
You're lost, brother.

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:43.880
Reve-eeeeeenge!

01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:04.100
I want revenge!

01:23:04.170 --> 01:23:06.840
Stop hurting me, brother.
Stop hurting me. Stop it!

01:23:14.150 --> 01:23:17.050
Brother, brother.
Wake up, wake up!

01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:18.490
Wake up, wake up!

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:38.070
- Amitabha.
- Amitabha.

01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:41.630
Has the general come here for worship?

01:23:43.410 --> 01:23:44.940
Oh, abbot...

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:47.110
what you just said was only half right!

01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:49.520
Can you tell me
why it was half right?

01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:52.020
Tang's invading our territory.

01:23:52.090 --> 01:23:53.750
In order to prepare for wars...

01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:56.660
...the royal court is
recruiting warriors for their army.

01:23:56.730 --> 01:23:58.850
I hope your temple
makes some contribution.

01:23:58.930 --> 01:24:01.020
There's been a rule that temples.

01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:03.330
...and shrines don't give grain
and men to the army.

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:07.700
Uh-huh.
A new chief brings in new aides.

01:24:07.770 --> 01:24:10.500
Even officials of the royal court.

01:24:10.570 --> 01:24:12.510
...are subject to the emperor.

01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:16.530
And besides,
it's a dumb rule, isn't it?

01:24:16.610 --> 01:24:19.010
Well, abbot...

01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:21.110
...don't you want
to make a contribution?

01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:23.080
No no.

01:24:23.150 --> 01:24:25.210
Because there is
not much grain in the temple.

01:24:25.290 --> 01:24:28.220
...and it would not
be enough supply for the army.

01:24:28.290 --> 01:24:29.490
It doesn't matter.

01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:31.490
Even a little grain can be accepted!

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:33.530
But if you refuse to turn it over...

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:35.960
...then you're resisting
the emperor's order.

01:24:36.030 --> 01:24:37.830
...and I won't spare you.
What do you think?

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Abbot, good bye!

01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:45.540
Oh, Amitabha.

01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:06.820
Brother...

01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:08.560
we're all forced to do it.

01:25:08.630 --> 01:25:10.660
But I'm very confused.

01:25:10.730 --> 01:25:12.630
The master has always told me.

01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:15.360
...to punish bad people,
but without killing.

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:17.410
If you don't punish those bad people...

01:25:17.470 --> 01:25:19.170
...those bad people will kill you.

01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:20.900
...and other good people.

01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:23.540
Yes. You are right.

01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:27.010
There is an opportunity now.

01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:28.950
I will punish that evil man...

01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:32.220
Zhu Can...
when he least expects it!

01:25:33.890 --> 01:25:36.320
- I want to help you.
- Good brother!

01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:38.790
Someday I'll help you get revenge!

01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:42.120
Let's go at night.

01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:44.170
We can't go
if we're found during the day!

01:25:44.230 --> 01:25:45.430
Okay.

01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:47.200
Let's.

01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:50.000
Quick! Take the meat!

01:25:58.250 --> 01:25:59.510
Delicious!

01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:00.780
Very delicious!

01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:24.940
Fang Lei, it's you!

01:26:25.010 --> 01:26:27.740
You don't even recognize
your closest relatives. Go to hell!

01:26:27.810 --> 01:26:28.780
Go!

01:27:25.370 --> 01:27:27.100
Go to hell!

01:27:27.170 --> 01:27:28.760
Brother!

01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:29.260
Wait!

01:28:30.530 --> 01:28:32.360
- Master!
- Amitabha!

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:38.000
Have you forgotten
that Buddha is lenient?

01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:40.630
But he killed hundreds of thousands.

01:28:40.710 --> 01:28:42.955
Don't spare him or...

01:28:42.990 --> 01:28:44.945
...the dead can't rest in peace!

01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:46.980
We've been standing
on the right side of the law

01:28:47.015 --> 01:28:48.545
...since the temple was established.

01:28:48.580 --> 01:28:51.250
We must release them
even if we are in danger.

01:28:51.285 --> 01:28:52.565
Yes yes yes!

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:55.160
I believe in Buddha too.

01:28:55.195 --> 01:28:58.115
If you spare me...

01:28:58.150 --> 01:29:00.540
I'll release their souls from purgatory.

01:29:00.575 --> 01:29:02.195
I hope you keep your word.

01:29:02.230 --> 01:29:04.905
- And never kill more people.
- Yes yes yes yes yes!

01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:07.570
- I'll give up evil and return to good!
- You can go now!

01:29:07.605 --> 01:29:09.090
Master!

01:29:11.150 --> 01:29:13.940
Thank you, thank you.

01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:17.670
- Abbot!
- Let him go.

01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:20.710
If he still does what he did,
he'll be punished by God!

01:29:24.290 --> 01:29:27.440
Those damned boys.

01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:32.250
I'll... I'll eat them.

01:29:44.370 --> 01:29:47.140
ZHU CAN ESCAPED BUT THEN WAS SHOT
TO DEATH BY HIS OWN SOLDIERS

01:29:47.210 --> 01:29:49.080
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT
THAT HE WAS ONE OF THE ENEMY.

01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:06.590
THE END

01:31:07.305 --> 01:31:13.203
