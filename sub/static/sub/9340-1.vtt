WEBVTT

00:50.341 --> 00:53.010
Always considering
the best interest, welfare...

00:53.261 --> 00:54.970
and well-being of the child.

00:55.180 --> 00:58.140
Therefore, you may make visitation
to you daughter...

00:58.308 --> 01:00.350
every other week
and on Christmas Eve...

01:00.602 --> 01:03.520
and on Easter Sunday,
wearing your pretty Easter outfits.

01:04.063 --> 01:08.025
Your honor, my ex-husband is addicted
to pills and he's a thief!

01:08.234 --> 01:12.321
Because of his arrest record, I lost
my job as a secretary for the FBI.

01:12.572 --> 01:15.240
He was the finest high-school
tailback I ever saw.

01:15.784 --> 01:19.161
Of course he's had his run-ins
with the law, but he's...

01:19.412 --> 01:21.705
made his accommodations
with the authorities.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.541
Being an informer
for the Dade County vice squad...

01:24.793 --> 01:27.920
hardly qualifies him
to raise a seven-year-old!

01:28.171 --> 01:30.422
Neither does being
a mother without a job!

01:30.673 --> 01:33.675
But I lost it because of him!

01:34.135 --> 01:35.636
Little lady...

01:35.845 --> 01:37.763
my decision is final.

01:41.476 --> 01:42.684
Next case.

02:09.002 --> 02:10.169
The big man's here!

02:10.380 --> 02:13.090
- When does she go on?
- Pretty soon, Jerry.

02:14.551 --> 02:17.469
- Welcome to Eager Beaver, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

02:20.431 --> 02:22.057
Keep it close.

02:22.642 --> 02:25.394
- Keep it very close.
- You got it.

02:26.521 --> 02:28.522
Last stop, okay?

02:30.191 --> 02:33.110
- What do you say, congressman?
- Poontang.

02:33.319 --> 02:36.029
The night is young
and full of promise, my boy.

02:36.239 --> 02:37.698
Great.

02:41.828 --> 02:45.247
Now look, this has to be
the last one. Now I told...

02:45.498 --> 02:49.376
Come on!
We got a rehearsal tomorrow.

02:53.381 --> 02:56.049
Melissa thinks I'm in temple.
What if she calls?

03:10.607 --> 03:14.067
Well, I feel so good
Everybody's getting high

03:14.235 --> 03:16.570
We've got the legendary
twin temples from Fort Lauderdale.

03:17.405 --> 03:21.074
Miss Urbana Sprawl wrapping up
on the great stage.

03:23.870 --> 03:30.292
And I'm so glad you made it
So glad you made it

03:32.003 --> 03:34.213
Nice spot, isn't it, Erb?

03:34.505 --> 03:36.215
It's very uplifting, sir.

03:39.802 --> 03:43.597
- The usual Evian with lime?
- Please.

03:44.432 --> 03:45.724
From Paris, France...

03:45.975 --> 03:49.102
put it together
for the fabulous Monique, Jr.!

04:00.823 --> 04:02.032
- Hey
- Hey

04:02.200 --> 04:03.533
- You
- You

04:03.826 --> 04:05.494
My God. I love you!

04:05.745 --> 04:07.496
- Who me?
- Yes, you

04:08.164 --> 04:09.790
Man.

04:16.005 --> 04:18.130
That song is killing me!

04:18.382 --> 04:21.927
Those babies gonna wind up in traction,
you don't play some ballads.

04:22.136 --> 04:23.387
God, it's freezing!

04:23.596 --> 04:27.808
They could store meat in here.
In fact, they do store meat in here.

04:28.059 --> 04:30.060
No, I've been trying all day!

04:30.270 --> 04:32.187
Are you positive?

04:32.438 --> 04:33.897
No, thank you.

04:35.191 --> 04:38.068
- Can't reach her?
- Darrell's phone's out of order.

04:38.319 --> 04:42.030
I just know he's moved with her
again to some new dump.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.449
God, what a nightmare!

04:44.659 --> 04:48.036
He drives around with her in that van.
Drinking, taking pills...

04:48.288 --> 04:50.747
He doesn't even think about
putting a seat belt on her.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.917
He's a dirtbag!
You hang in there, honey.

04:54.168 --> 04:55.377
You'll get Angela back.

04:55.628 --> 04:57.254
That judge will see the light.

04:57.505 --> 04:59.756
It's expensive light,
I'll tell you that.

05:00.008 --> 05:02.217
It's gonna cost me $15,000
for this appeal.

05:02.427 --> 05:05.220
Is there even a chance
I can make that in six weeks?

05:05.430 --> 05:09.516
You'll have to dance day and night
and hope some Arab sheik shows up.

05:09.767 --> 05:13.687
I love you, girls, I do. But I can't
work here when I go back to court.

05:13.896 --> 05:18.066
"Your honor, I found a new job.
I'm working at the Eager Beaver."

05:18.318 --> 05:20.777
It's honest work.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

05:21.195 --> 05:24.531
I know that and you know that.
But the judge won't.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.408
Not him.

05:31.497 --> 05:34.416
God, I still get nauseous
before I have to go out there.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.293
You'll get over it.

05:37.211 --> 05:40.172
Really? I can't imagine that.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.093
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

05:45.261 --> 05:48.180
I'll be the sun, shining on you

05:49.640 --> 05:51.641
You guys having a good time?

05:51.851 --> 05:53.185
Here's the lucky guy!

05:53.436 --> 05:55.937
You've come to the right place.
Monique!

05:56.189 --> 05:57.898
Look at these hunks!

05:58.107 --> 05:59.858
We're having a party!

06:02.987 --> 06:04.654
Get out of my dreams

06:05.156 --> 06:07.699
Keep an eye on them bachelors.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.159
Get into my car

06:12.038 --> 06:13.622
They look like real trouble.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.126
Get into my car

06:18.294 --> 06:19.503
Yeah!

06:19.670 --> 06:23.298
Get out of my dreams

06:23.633 --> 06:26.051
Get into my car

06:28.596 --> 06:30.138
- I said, hey
- Hey

06:30.306 --> 06:31.723
- You
- You

06:31.891 --> 06:34.309
Get into my car

06:36.729 --> 06:41.566
It's time to strap yourselves in
because you are going for a ride!

06:42.360 --> 06:43.944
In her eighth week here...

06:44.195 --> 06:47.572
put your hands together
and make her feel good.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.575
For the one, the only Erin Grant!

06:50.827 --> 06:52.994
How about that!

06:53.413 --> 06:55.705
- Larry King's at table six.
- What's he wearing?

06:55.915 --> 06:58.917
Tank top and gold chains
That's Larry, all right.

06:59.168 --> 07:00.168
Yo.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.548
- How do I look?
- Better than me.

07:04.799 --> 07:07.509
That ain't easy.
You talk to her?

07:08.010 --> 07:10.679
Darrell's phone's out of order.
I think he moved again.

07:10.930 --> 07:14.057
I'd embrace the opportunity
to maim his white ass up.

07:15.101 --> 07:18.603
That's really thoughtful, but I
don't think it'd help me in court.

07:18.813 --> 07:21.815
Erin, come on. Chop-chop.
I can't have an empty stage.

07:22.024 --> 07:23.483
Man, let the chumps wait!

07:58.603 --> 08:03.440
Money can't buy it, baby

08:04.025 --> 08:08.820
Sex can't buy it, baby

08:09.697 --> 08:14.326
Drugs can't buy it, baby

08:15.161 --> 08:19.748
You can't buy it, baby

08:30.510 --> 08:32.177
Going to the head.

08:32.385 --> 08:34.054
You'll behave?

08:36.265 --> 08:39.683
I believe in love alone
Yeah, yeah

08:53.741 --> 08:58.370
Take the power to set you free

08:58.746 --> 09:01.206
- Yeah!
- Whoo! Yeah!

09:01.374 --> 09:03.124
Throw away the key

09:04.835 --> 09:06.628
Give up your needs

09:11.175 --> 09:12.300
Whoa.

09:14.887 --> 09:17.597
I believe in the power of creation

09:17.765 --> 09:20.350
I believe in the good vibration

09:23.980 --> 09:25.689
An angel appeared.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.652
An angel of pure delight.

09:30.861 --> 09:33.947
What we're coming to

09:35.825 --> 09:38.994
Till we watch those dreams come true

09:39.996 --> 09:45.083
All the money in the world
Won't buy you peace of mind

09:45.251 --> 09:52.173
You can have it all
But you still won't be satisfied

09:54.552 --> 09:56.720
Money can't buy it, baby

09:57.388 --> 09:58.430
Go, Paul!

09:59.849 --> 10:01.266
Sex can't buy it

10:01.434 --> 10:02.559
Yeah!

10:05.646 --> 10:06.938
Go, Paul!

10:07.189 --> 10:10.066
I'm getting married
this weekend to Melissa.

10:10.735 --> 10:11.735
You love Melissa?

10:11.986 --> 10:14.487
- Very much.
- Then go home to her.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.949
Shad!

10:18.326 --> 10:20.035
Shad!

10:20.202 --> 10:23.788
I got every kind of thing
That the money can buy

10:24.332 --> 10:27.876
Listen up! The Flesh Farm
is killing us and you know why?

10:28.127 --> 10:30.420
- They have free buffalo wings.
- Their girls are hookers.

10:30.671 --> 10:32.964
No, because their girls dance fast.

10:33.215 --> 10:35.842
And fast means sweat.
And sweat...

10:36.177 --> 10:37.385
means drinking!

10:40.056 --> 10:41.222
My God!

10:41.432 --> 10:42.515
Shad!

10:43.267 --> 10:44.934
What was that?

10:46.896 --> 10:48.438
I got this.

10:55.571 --> 10:57.238
Whoa!

10:59.325 --> 11:01.409
Coming through.
Move out of the way.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.328
Way to go, Davey!

11:07.750 --> 11:08.958
Everybody, go. Run.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.587
Back up! Back the hell up!

11:13.631 --> 11:15.423
- You all right?
- Fine. How about this guy?

11:15.716 --> 11:18.843
Good thing he was drunk.
You could've gotten hurt.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.763
On the main stage,
our lost little pussycat.

11:21.972 --> 11:26.601
Put your hands together for the one,
the only Miss Sabrina Hepburn!

11:26.852 --> 11:28.520
Meow!

11:34.860 --> 11:38.113
Meow

11:38.280 --> 11:40.073
- Is this your cat?
- Yoo-hoo

11:40.241 --> 11:42.158
- Look at this cat
- Yoo-hoo

11:42.493 --> 11:45.161
I leave you alone for five minutes!

11:45.413 --> 11:48.373
Will you get in?
Watch your foot, stupid.

11:48.624 --> 11:52.001
Malcolm's gonna shit a brick.
Thank you.

11:52.378 --> 11:53.503
Did I touch any girls?

11:53.754 --> 11:56.381
Not this time,
but you were recognized.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.591
Okay? Happy?

12:11.480 --> 12:14.107
- How are you, little angel?
- I'm fine, thank you.

12:14.316 --> 12:17.235
- Kids just tear me up.
- She's a brave one.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.654
You'll be in my prayers.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.614
God bless you, ma'am.

12:36.589 --> 12:37.672
Last stop, little 'un.

12:38.549 --> 12:39.758
Daddy, you're mean!

12:40.009 --> 12:43.011
Evers and Jennings.
This is the new model, the X12.

12:43.554 --> 12:46.139
- You're happy?
- Mucho happy.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.725
- Mucho happy?
- Get in the van.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.643
Mucho, mucho, mucho!

12:50.853 --> 12:54.773
Get in. We're in a loading zone.
We don't wanna break the law.

12:56.233 --> 12:58.902
Daddy, did you tell Mommy
that we moved?

13:01.071 --> 13:03.323
Of course I did, buttercup.

13:03.532 --> 13:04.908
Of course I did.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.080
How about a wine cooler, Erin?

13:11.248 --> 13:14.083
I got mango, passion fruit...

13:14.335 --> 13:18.129
Water would be just fine,
Alberto. Thanks.

13:18.589 --> 13:21.716
Rita, the reason I stopped by
is Darrell's moved again...

13:21.967 --> 13:24.052
and I need his new phone number.

13:24.845 --> 13:27.180
Yeah? Well, you come
to the wrong place.

13:27.431 --> 13:30.433
Rita, please. I hardly sleep nights
and then I break out into...

13:30.935 --> 13:34.479
Look, Erin, I got no idea
where my brother is, okay?

13:35.898 --> 13:37.524
Shit! They got the cat!

13:37.775 --> 13:39.025
Wolves got no restraint.

13:39.276 --> 13:41.694
- Careful, sweetie.
- Shut up!

13:43.656 --> 13:45.740
She's all caught up with them cubs.

13:46.492 --> 13:49.869
Some of the guys down
at the nuclear plant...

13:50.120 --> 13:54.332
they were asking me
if you'd do, like...

13:54.542 --> 13:56.084
private parties.

13:56.710 --> 13:57.836
I don't think so.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.213
That's a shame.

14:00.464 --> 14:04.217
Because I'll bet that
you are a great dancer.

14:04.426 --> 14:07.595
Alberto, I'll go crazy if
I don't get Darrell's new number.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.849
I promised Angie I would
call her every day and...

14:11.058 --> 14:12.392
I hear he moved, Darrell.

14:12.643 --> 14:14.185
Alberto, where is he?

14:14.895 --> 14:17.021
You have to ask Rita about that.

14:18.274 --> 14:22.235
He calls here about twice a week.
Collect.

14:22.653 --> 14:24.696
Need money, as usual...

14:24.947 --> 14:26.573
but he don't speak to me.

14:26.824 --> 14:29.993
Got no respect for me
even though I am...

14:30.244 --> 14:32.579
a professional man.

14:33.414 --> 14:35.540
You're looking real good.

14:35.791 --> 14:37.792
God, I've got such a headache.

14:38.043 --> 14:39.836
Yeah? You want some Advil?

14:40.546 --> 14:42.589
That would be so great.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.257
Well, now, you sit right here.

14:44.508 --> 14:47.886
I'm gonna fix up
that mean old headache.

15:01.817 --> 15:05.945
Alberto, never mind. I've gotta run,
but thanks anyhow.

15:20.961 --> 15:22.378
Deerfield Beach?

15:23.088 --> 15:24.839
We had a good day, baby.

15:26.216 --> 15:27.842
Phone's ringing.
Think it's Mama?

15:28.052 --> 15:32.639
No, little 'un. I talked to her
and she's too busy to call you.

15:42.441 --> 15:43.441
Damn him!

16:57.683 --> 17:03.813
Come to me, run to me
Do and be done with me

17:03.981 --> 17:08.818
Cold, cold, cold

17:09.403 --> 17:11.820
Don't I exist for you?

17:11.989 --> 17:14.156
Nice leg.
Maybe I'll take it home.

17:14.366 --> 17:15.575
I recommend you let go.

17:15.826 --> 17:17.617
Here's 500, baby.

17:17.828 --> 17:18.869
What'd you say?

17:19.288 --> 17:21.039
Cold

17:21.749 --> 17:27.627
Everything I possess
Given with tenderness

17:27.796 --> 17:32.633
Wrapped in a ribbon of glass

17:33.719 --> 17:36.095
Time, it may take us

17:36.263 --> 17:43.811
But God only knows
How I've paid for those things in the past

17:45.564 --> 17:52.945
Dying is easy
It's living that scares me to death

17:53.322 --> 17:56.324
Ooh, yeah

17:57.743 --> 18:05.875
I could be so content
Hearing the sound of your breath

18:06.043 --> 18:08.711
Ooh, yeah

18:09.797 --> 18:13.341
Cold is the color of crystal

18:13.509 --> 18:20.348
The snowlight that falls
From the heavenly skies

18:21.642 --> 18:25.520
Catch me and let me dive under

18:25.687 --> 18:32.318
For I want to swim in the pools
Of your eyes

18:36.031 --> 18:38.699
I want to be with you, baby

18:38.867 --> 18:45.623
Slip me inside your heart

18:46.542 --> 18:48.918
What's with Princess Di tonight?

18:49.169 --> 18:51.504
Her husband disappeared
with the kid again.

18:51.797 --> 18:56.968
Nothing can tear us apart

18:58.095 --> 19:02.348
Come on now, come on now, come on now

19:02.516 --> 19:09.272
Telling you that I loved you
Right from the start

19:11.692 --> 19:15.528
But the more I want you the less I get

19:16.446 --> 19:21.701
Ain't that just the way things are?

19:34.631 --> 19:37.466
I don't suppose you'd
accept this in appreciation.

19:37.718 --> 19:39.135
No need.

19:39.386 --> 19:42.263
SeÃ±or Cucaracha
here is gonna make me rich.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.807
My God!

19:45.058 --> 19:46.434
Is that a roach?

19:46.643 --> 19:49.604
No, it's a fucking shrimp.
Move, you're in my light.

19:52.733 --> 19:55.610
Get some manners, mister!

19:58.322 --> 20:00.114
So this is the new brainstorm, huh?

20:00.365 --> 20:04.619
The Wall Street Journal says
this is the hottest-selling yogurt.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.037
I'll bring this in...

20:06.288 --> 20:08.998
say my hair fell out
from the shock. Boom.

20:09.249 --> 20:10.875
They pay off bigtime.

20:11.126 --> 20:13.169
Lawyer thinks it's a genius idea.

20:13.420 --> 20:16.255
Your lawyer has an office
over a video store.

20:17.132 --> 20:20.509
Call me a dreamer.
I don't wanna be a bouncer forever.

20:20.928 --> 20:25.014
- Erin! Note from Jerry!
- Ooh.

20:25.182 --> 20:27.099
What does it say?

20:28.310 --> 20:31.896
I can help you
get your daughter back.

20:32.105 --> 20:35.024
"I ask nothing in return
but a kind smile."

20:35.275 --> 20:37.318
- Yeah, right!
- He's a weirdo.

20:37.569 --> 20:40.279
You guys!
He is totally harmless.

20:40.530 --> 20:41.656
Come on!

20:41.907 --> 20:45.326
"Also, could you add
Kenny G to your routine?

20:45.577 --> 20:47.536
Anything from his Christmas album."

20:47.788 --> 20:49.038
That's sweet.

20:49.289 --> 20:51.165
We could do a Christmas show here!

20:51.667 --> 20:54.835
Seriously, it couldn't hurt
to talk to him, right?

20:55.254 --> 20:58.339
- Only talking, no touching.
- Ladies! Attention!

20:59.091 --> 21:01.342
- Major announcement.
- Major asshole.

21:01.593 --> 21:02.802
I heard that.

21:03.053 --> 21:06.347
On Monday, I'm installing a ring.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.432
- No.
- Mud wrestling?

21:08.684 --> 21:11.018
No, no, no. This is something
that's really happening.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.229
It's contemporary. It's now.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.731
And it's creamed-corn wrestling.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.233
- Corn?
- Corn wrestling?

21:17.526 --> 21:18.985
That's disgusting!

21:19.194 --> 21:21.946
I'm not putting these in corn.
No way!

21:22.197 --> 21:24.073
What? No, it's terrific!

21:24.324 --> 21:26.158
In Israel, we did falafel wrestling.

21:26.410 --> 21:29.287
All the girls broke out
in hives everywhere.

21:29.538 --> 21:30.955
And I mean, everywhere!

21:31.206 --> 21:33.541
Well, falafel, sure.
This is corn!

21:35.002 --> 21:37.586
- What is this, a mutiny?
- I don't think so.

21:38.130 --> 21:41.340
No chance that I'm gonna roll
around naked in creamed corn...

21:41.550 --> 21:45.136
with drunken yahoos trying
to stick niblets up my hoo-hah.

21:45.387 --> 21:48.055
Not naked. Topless.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.558
Health Department won't go for naked.

21:50.809 --> 21:51.934
Not with food products.

21:52.185 --> 21:54.270
I always liked the Health Department.

21:54.521 --> 21:55.730
So you'll think about it?

21:55.981 --> 21:57.565
- Not for one second.
- Erin!

21:57.816 --> 22:00.860
Please!
You're getting a big following here.

22:01.111 --> 22:03.571
Even with that shit music,
the guys love you.

22:04.031 --> 22:08.409
You go into the corn, you set
a great example to the other girls.

22:10.370 --> 22:11.370
No.

22:12.914 --> 22:13.998
I got it!

22:14.374 --> 22:16.625
How about pasta wrestling?

22:16.877 --> 22:17.960
Now that's classy.

22:18.211 --> 22:21.630
Linguine, rigatoni?
Just nothing with meat or fish.

22:22.591 --> 22:25.384
Orly, if I wanted to wrestle...

22:25.635 --> 22:28.679
I would've joined
the World Wrestling Federation.

22:31.058 --> 22:34.060
- And speaking of real class?
- What's the problem?

22:34.269 --> 22:38.481
We hate these.
They degrade women and beavers.

22:38.774 --> 22:42.401
I'll take it under advisement.
But just the coasters and the napkins.

22:42.611 --> 22:45.071
Not the sign.
That's a landmark!

22:47.866 --> 22:49.533
Good night, darling.

22:59.628 --> 23:00.628
For you, Miss Grant.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.965
They're beautiful, Jerry.
Thank you.

23:05.175 --> 23:06.258
You can call me Erin...

23:06.510 --> 23:08.844
I can't.
I worship you too much.

23:09.429 --> 23:11.055
Believe me...

23:11.306 --> 23:13.516
I'm no one to be worshiped.

23:13.725 --> 23:15.643
I'm just trying to make a living.

23:15.894 --> 23:17.269
I worship your essence.

23:18.271 --> 23:20.773
If you were a nurse or a teacher,
I'd feel the same.

23:21.108 --> 23:22.191
You receive my note?

23:22.526 --> 23:26.779
I did and, you know, I was wondering
what you had in mind.

23:27.072 --> 23:29.990
I believe I can help you
get your daughter back.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.868
I believe I can
get to Judge Fingerhut.

23:35.288 --> 23:36.539
- How?
- Through...

23:36.790 --> 23:40.668
a certain congressman who
I'm certain will listen to me...

23:41.628 --> 23:43.254
because I know some things.

23:43.964 --> 23:46.924
Things? Really?

23:47.175 --> 23:50.636
Well, you know what, Jerry?
You're really a terrific guy...

23:50.887 --> 23:53.681
and so supportive of me
ever since I started here.

23:53.932 --> 23:55.433
Maybe you shouldn't...

23:56.101 --> 23:57.935
Just give me a week.

24:00.021 --> 24:01.564
Good night, my precious.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.618
Melissa thinks I was in synagogue
the night this happened.

24:14.828 --> 24:16.537
What do I tell her?

24:16.788 --> 24:20.458
You left synagogue and a gang
of skinheads jumped you in the parking lot.

24:20.709 --> 24:23.586
In the meantime, we'll develop these,
we'll see what we have.

24:23.837 --> 24:27.131
I see mucho damages. These strip
joints are insured up the ass.

24:27.340 --> 24:29.633
My neck really feels better,
Uncle Al.

24:29.885 --> 24:31.343
Yeah?

24:32.220 --> 24:34.013
How's it feel now?

24:41.813 --> 24:43.481
Call Little Caesars.

24:43.732 --> 24:46.108
Order me a health pizza.
Get some for yourself.

24:46.359 --> 24:48.027
No, thank you, sir.
I'm dieting.

24:48.278 --> 24:50.696
I'll just grab a yogurt
out of the fridge.

25:20.352 --> 25:23.437
This is a major disaster!

25:23.647 --> 25:26.649
Major. Unbelievable.
Without doubt...

25:26.858 --> 25:31.362
the most asinine piece
of human behavior.

25:32.656 --> 25:34.740
It's never gonna
happen again, Malcolm.

25:34.991 --> 25:36.617
I've got it under control.

25:37.452 --> 25:38.661
You see...

25:38.912 --> 25:42.039
I just love naked women.
It's a character flaw.

25:42.290 --> 25:43.332
God's testing me...

25:43.583 --> 25:46.627
Will you shut up! You idiot.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.589
You can't talk to me like that.
I'm a U.S. congressman.

25:50.799 --> 25:54.468
I can't? You go psycho in a titty bar
six weeks before the election.

25:54.678 --> 25:58.055
What should I call you?
Winston fucking Churchill?

25:58.431 --> 25:59.515
It was all I could do to keep...

25:59.766 --> 26:03.602
Willie Rojo from strangling you
with his bare hands.

26:03.853 --> 26:05.187
Everybody has a bad night.

26:05.438 --> 26:09.108
If you're under pressure like we are,
under the public eye...

26:10.652 --> 26:12.653
Who recognized me?

26:13.363 --> 26:14.947
His name...

26:15.156 --> 26:17.241
is Jerry Killian.

26:17.534 --> 26:20.786
And he's waiting outside.

26:21.871 --> 26:22.871
Now?

26:23.123 --> 26:27.042
Now. We gotta move on this
before we get eaten alive.

26:27.252 --> 26:28.335
Move on what?

26:28.587 --> 26:31.422
If this is a shakedown,
get Willie to pay them like always.

26:31.673 --> 26:35.884
- Why drag me into it...
- Because it's not about money.

26:36.219 --> 26:38.262
- It's not?
- No.

26:40.181 --> 26:43.142
He wants you to persuade
Judge Fingerhut...

26:43.393 --> 26:47.271
to reverse a child custody case
for some stripper.

26:48.106 --> 26:49.315
Who he's porking?

26:49.566 --> 26:52.651
It's disgraceful to have
a man like me deal with...

26:53.570 --> 26:54.778
He's not porking her.

26:57.157 --> 26:59.241
Well, then, why does he care?

26:59.492 --> 27:01.660
Because he's nuts!

27:02.912 --> 27:04.163
That's why he's dangerous.

27:04.414 --> 27:08.792
If he was porking her, at least
I could deal with him man to man...

27:09.044 --> 27:10.711
but this is fruitcake love.

27:14.674 --> 27:18.761
I mean, Fingerhut's a democrat.
He won't listen to me.

27:18.970 --> 27:21.764
You can't say that
to this little creep, Davey.

27:22.182 --> 27:24.183
You gotta string him along.

27:24.392 --> 27:26.060
Bullshit him.

27:27.395 --> 27:29.480
Use the old...

27:29.689 --> 27:31.523
Dilbeck charm.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.197
What if he doesn't go for it?

27:39.491 --> 27:41.867
Then we have a serious problem.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.374
Mr. Killian!

27:49.042 --> 27:52.252
Come in and meet
Congressman Dilbeck.

27:56.549 --> 27:59.259
I'll bet that's Jerry Killian.

28:00.845 --> 28:02.554
Lucy!

28:04.808 --> 28:06.308
Come here.

28:08.353 --> 28:09.853
Come on.

28:10.313 --> 28:12.773
How perfect is this?

28:14.401 --> 28:16.735
You know, I was just thinking...

28:17.654 --> 28:21.115
is this really on
the same planet as Miami?

28:24.744 --> 28:26.745
I can read.

28:28.289 --> 28:29.915
Where's Andy?

28:30.166 --> 28:32.918
He's been fishing since 8.

28:33.169 --> 28:34.670
Dad!

28:35.088 --> 28:36.547
Dad!

28:37.757 --> 28:38.799
There's a floater!

28:54.441 --> 28:56.191
He's still got his glasses on.

28:56.985 --> 28:58.444
Yeah.

28:59.237 --> 29:00.738
Go tell Mom to call the police.

29:01.239 --> 29:03.866
- You're the police.
- I'm the Miami police.

29:04.075 --> 29:06.076
We just need the local law here.

29:06.327 --> 29:07.828
Go on.

29:14.711 --> 29:15.961
Man.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.632
Of all the lakes...

29:21.050 --> 29:23.260
in all the counties...

29:23.470 --> 29:24.928
in all the world...

29:25.972 --> 29:28.265
you gotta float up in mine.

29:28.975 --> 29:31.727
You son of a bitch.

29:33.354 --> 29:34.772
Mama!

29:35.857 --> 29:37.483
Hey, come here!

29:37.734 --> 29:39.735
I've been trying to reach you, baby.

29:39.986 --> 29:42.571
Heard you stole my sister's mail!

29:42.822 --> 29:44.740
That's a federal offense.

29:44.949 --> 29:47.659
Wait for Mommy.
I'm gonna go talk to Daddy.

29:51.289 --> 29:54.458
Why do you keep moving?
How will she make any friends?

29:54.709 --> 29:56.084
Aren't we the child psych...

29:56.294 --> 29:59.463
It has nothing to do with child
psychology, you moron!

29:59.714 --> 30:01.256
Where's she going to school?

30:01.508 --> 30:05.177
Opa-Iocka? Deerfield Beach?
Have you even thought about it?

30:05.845 --> 30:08.138
Yeah, I thought about it plenty.

30:11.309 --> 30:13.310
Hey, you only got two hours!

30:13.520 --> 30:16.396
That's what the judge ruled,
right there, from that bench!

30:16.648 --> 30:20.609
I'll be right behind you just in case
you're thinking about snatching her!

30:20.819 --> 30:23.529
Mommy, does "snatch" mean "kidnap"?

30:24.030 --> 30:27.032
How did you get so smart?

30:43.424 --> 30:45.425
Is Free Willy back yet?

30:46.970 --> 30:48.554
Still out.

30:50.014 --> 30:54.142
People are pigs.
Sit on movies like they own them.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.603
Freak.

31:03.653 --> 31:06.071
It's Shad. Open up.

31:06.573 --> 31:08.407
It wasn't me. It was a temp.

31:08.658 --> 31:10.284
Where's Perry Mason?

31:10.535 --> 31:14.621
Our good friend, Mr. Shad!
Come on in, we have lots to discuss.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.707
No shit.

31:19.085 --> 31:22.838
If I buzz twice, you say my mother's
on the line. She has chest pains.

31:23.047 --> 31:25.591
What do you mean
he's a wheelchair salesman?

31:25.842 --> 31:28.051
There's one nice thing about hospitals.

31:28.303 --> 31:32.222
A lot of kids in chairs are
really sick, and I wave at them...

31:32.473 --> 31:34.808
and they smile
just like on Jerry Lewis.

31:35.018 --> 31:38.645
- And do you do this every day?
- On Fridays I stay with Aunt Rita.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.064
That's a wholesome environment.

31:41.274 --> 31:42.816
She has real wolves.

31:43.067 --> 31:45.569
I don't want you
touching those animals.

31:45.820 --> 31:48.113
They're not like dogs.

31:57.373 --> 32:01.585
Time.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.796
I love you more than
anything in the world.

32:05.048 --> 32:07.382
- You know that in your heart.
- Mm-hm.

32:07.550 --> 32:08.842
- Mommy?
- What, baby?

32:09.052 --> 32:11.386
Do you know those dolls you got me?

32:11.846 --> 32:14.556
Daddy says he can't
find them anywhere.

32:16.851 --> 32:17.893
We'll get you new ones.

32:18.353 --> 32:21.146
- I love you.
- Bye, baby. I love you.

32:21.397 --> 32:22.648
Hey, let's go!

32:25.401 --> 32:28.278
All right, you go on.
I'll bring your stuff.

32:33.368 --> 32:36.078
Hey, baby!
Did you have a good day?

32:36.329 --> 32:38.497
- Mm-hm.
- Good.

32:42.835 --> 32:45.754
She told me about your new profession.
Really admirable.

32:46.005 --> 32:47.214
At least I ain't naked.

32:47.465 --> 32:48.715
"At least I ain't naked"?

32:48.925 --> 32:51.051
You get caught using
that child in a felony...

32:51.302 --> 32:54.972
- And Family Services will put her...
- No way I'd get caught.

32:55.974 --> 32:59.768
Got me one of them doctor's
jackets and a stethoscope.

33:02.105 --> 33:03.855
Look like one of them dudes on ER.

33:04.107 --> 33:06.566
Darrell, would you think
for once in your life?

33:06.734 --> 33:07.776
Hey!

33:10.071 --> 33:13.323
I don't need no stripper
telling me how to behave.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.909
I'll see you in two weeks.

33:21.499 --> 33:23.333
- You ready?
- Mm-hm.

33:43.521 --> 33:44.730
You know where that was taken?

33:45.189 --> 33:46.690
Your mama's birthday party.

33:47.191 --> 33:51.361
The Eager Beaver. Last
Wednesday. Can you identify those people?

33:52.071 --> 33:54.239
Yeah, this old fool. Erin.

33:54.615 --> 33:55.741
Erin's the stripper?

33:56.200 --> 33:57.826
What'd you say?

33:57.994 --> 33:59.828
Erin's the stripper.

34:00.246 --> 34:02.789
- Dancer, fat-ass.
- Dancer. She's a dancer!

34:03.207 --> 34:04.833
All right, look.

34:05.752 --> 34:09.463
The young man who was
so savagely beaten...

34:09.714 --> 34:12.132
is my client, Paul Guber.

34:12.632 --> 34:14.676
No shit. Too bad for him.

34:15.636 --> 34:16.762
I don't think so.

34:17.013 --> 34:19.639
The third person in that photo
is none other than...

34:19.849 --> 34:22.476
David L. Dilbeck.

34:24.020 --> 34:25.478
So what?

34:26.313 --> 34:28.815
Do you follow politics, Mr. Shad?

34:30.275 --> 34:32.610
Do I look like I follow politics?

34:32.862 --> 34:35.197
David Dilbeck
is the United States congressman...

34:35.364 --> 34:38.366
from the fifth district.
He's up for reelection in six weeks.

34:39.494 --> 34:41.745
You gonna put the squeeze on him.

34:41.954 --> 34:45.040
Nice.
What that gotta do with me?

34:45.708 --> 34:48.001
I'll give you 10 percent of the squeeze.

34:54.717 --> 34:57.302
Is this conceivably
as big as the yogurt deal?

34:58.721 --> 35:01.014
"As big"?

35:01.182 --> 35:05.811
Congressman Dilbeck is chairman
of the subcommittee on sugar, okay?

35:06.062 --> 35:08.438
The Rojo family cannot
allow him to lose.

35:08.689 --> 35:13.401
Because their price supports are worth
hundreds of millions of dollars.

35:13.653 --> 35:15.403
And quite frankly, Mr. Shad...

35:16.447 --> 35:19.282
this is the opportunity
of a lifetime.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.452
Good.

35:23.454 --> 35:24.788
Just keep Erin out of it.

35:24.997 --> 35:26.123
I'll do my best.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.209
She's out. Erin is out.
Erin who?

35:37.176 --> 35:40.428
They're all the time
Getting in front of me

35:40.763 --> 35:41.972
Charming spot.

35:42.223 --> 35:43.932
Look. Steven Spielberg's house.

35:44.183 --> 35:48.270
I wish he'd come in here.
I'm sure he would have big hots for me.

35:48.479 --> 35:50.188
You'd turn his whole life around.

35:50.439 --> 35:54.776
Steven Spielberg's shower. Can you
imagine me and him in that shower?

35:55.027 --> 35:58.697
- That cute little beard!
- Yours or his?

36:00.658 --> 36:04.870
Hey, Jerry, it's Erin Grant.
What a long beep.

36:05.121 --> 36:07.038
Someone's waiting for you.

36:07.248 --> 36:08.999
Maybe you're out of town...

36:09.250 --> 36:13.170
I'm just calling to see about
that legal matter we discussed.

36:13.421 --> 36:16.631
If you get a chance,
just give me a call at the club.

36:16.883 --> 36:18.508
Thanks, bye.

36:20.344 --> 36:22.762
- Michael Jordan's at table eight!
- Great.

36:23.014 --> 36:26.349
Say hello to
the fantastic Monique, Jr.!

36:33.941 --> 36:36.902
Lieutenant Garcia with homicide.

36:37.153 --> 36:38.737
What's he want with Erin?

36:38.988 --> 36:40.739
Got no idea.

36:40.990 --> 36:42.782
All I need is scandal.

36:52.501 --> 36:54.252
What do you know about Prozac?

36:55.296 --> 36:58.298
It makes you happy.
There's side effects.

36:58.799 --> 37:00.634
Like what?

37:01.052 --> 37:02.636
Limp noodle.

37:02.803 --> 37:04.179
Who cares?

37:04.430 --> 37:07.933
I haven't had a hard-on
since I started running this place.

37:08.559 --> 37:11.478
Closest I got was Sea World.

37:12.063 --> 37:14.397
Porpoise got me hot.

37:16.025 --> 37:18.777
What the fuck
you telling me that for?

37:21.781 --> 37:25.033
I'm going next door.
See what Ling's up to.

37:29.830 --> 37:31.498
- Drowned?
- Yeah.

37:32.291 --> 37:33.625
My God.

37:33.876 --> 37:36.920
He had pictures of you
all over his apartment.

37:38.631 --> 37:41.716
He was a really big fan.
He used to bring me flowers...

37:41.968 --> 37:45.053
He was just a fan?
There was no touching?

37:46.389 --> 37:48.014
This has been a real pleasure.

37:48.224 --> 37:50.100
I dance, so I must turn tricks?

37:50.309 --> 37:53.979
Nice way to open a conversation.
"I understand you're a hooker?"

37:54.188 --> 37:56.439
You don't work in a library here.

37:57.858 --> 37:59.818
I'm trying to figure out
the man's life.

38:00.069 --> 38:01.736
He was a customer.

38:01.988 --> 38:04.781
That's all I know about his life.
Except that it's over.

38:05.032 --> 38:07.784
Okay. I apologize.

38:08.035 --> 38:11.246
Sincerely. Look, I'm real...
I'm nowhere on this.

38:11.497 --> 38:13.915
I could use some...
Please give me a minute?

38:16.544 --> 38:17.627
Please?

38:22.049 --> 38:24.634
- So where did this happen?
- Lake Okeechobee.

38:26.095 --> 38:29.848
It's where I made the serious
mistake of taking my vacation.

38:33.227 --> 38:35.603
Your family? Nice.

38:38.441 --> 38:42.402
It's not the kind of place
you'd expect to encounter a homicide.

38:42.611 --> 38:45.530
- Homicide? You said he drowned.
- No, we did an autopsy.

38:46.115 --> 38:49.784
The water in his lungs,
they come up clean.

38:50.036 --> 38:52.704
- There was tap water in his lungs?
- Exactly.

38:52.955 --> 38:56.624
Somebody killed him, like in a bathtub,
then dumped the body in a lake.

38:57.293 --> 38:58.460
Do you read mysteries?

38:59.045 --> 39:02.797
Up till three months ago,
I worked at the FBI in Miami.

39:03.632 --> 39:07.886
A secretary. Until I got fired
for having a defective husband.

39:11.182 --> 39:15.560
I'm in a pretty bad custody fight.
Jerry was trying to help me.

39:15.811 --> 39:17.687
From the shores of the Dead Sea...

39:17.938 --> 39:20.190
a decorated nurse
in the Israeli army...

39:20.441 --> 39:25.070
say shalom to
the fabulous Ariel Sharon!

39:37.333 --> 39:40.377
Could we go outside?
I could really use some air.

40:09.698 --> 40:12.992
I don't like you

40:13.160 --> 40:15.537
But I love you

40:15.704 --> 40:21.668
Seems that I'm always thinking of you

40:21.836 --> 40:26.339
You treat me badly

40:26.757 --> 40:28.633
I love you madly

40:30.428 --> 40:32.637
You really got a hold on me

40:32.805 --> 40:35.098
Really got a hold on me

40:35.266 --> 40:37.350
You really got a hold on me

40:37.768 --> 40:41.688
Mr. Orly!
What a wonderful surprise.

40:41.939 --> 40:44.315
Nice to be in quality club, eh?

40:44.567 --> 40:46.860
Yeah, if you like freak shows.

40:47.361 --> 40:48.987
Ling! Ling! Get over here!

40:49.238 --> 40:50.405
Move it!

40:50.614 --> 40:52.031
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.159
But that's Mr. Chris Rojo...

40:54.368 --> 40:56.327
of the sugar Rojos.

40:56.579 --> 40:59.747
Typical of the kind
of rich big shots we get here.

41:00.416 --> 41:02.709
My love is strong now

41:02.877 --> 41:05.920
You really got a hold on me

41:06.088 --> 41:08.965
Really got a hold on me

41:09.133 --> 41:12.051
You really got a hold on me

41:12.219 --> 41:14.804
Really got a hold on me

41:14.972 --> 41:17.056
Baby

41:18.392 --> 41:21.102
Is this the place
where I met my angel?

41:21.687 --> 41:24.063
I don't know which angel
you're referring to.

41:27.943 --> 41:30.403
- A congressman?
- A congressman.

41:30.696 --> 41:32.363
You mean a U.S. congressman?

41:32.573 --> 41:34.741
Well, he wasn't specific who it was.

41:34.992 --> 41:36.367
I told him it was bananas...

41:36.619 --> 41:39.662
and maybe it was better
that he stayed out of it.

41:40.706 --> 41:43.249
On Wednesday, there was an incident,
a guy with a bottle...

41:43.584 --> 41:48.004
He was a total whack job.
Drunk out of his mind.

41:48.881 --> 41:51.341
Can you remember,
was Mr. Killian here?

41:52.259 --> 41:53.927
No, not offhand, but maybe.

41:54.178 --> 41:57.805
Think about that and let me know.
Here's all my numbers.

41:58.432 --> 42:01.476
Once again, I apologize.
I mean, for any aspersions.

42:05.523 --> 42:07.607
You wanna make it up to me?

42:07.983 --> 42:10.652
- I beg your pardon?
- I need a favor.

42:10.903 --> 42:13.112
You've got friends on the vice squad?

42:13.364 --> 42:14.906
They're not my bosom buddies.

42:15.115 --> 42:16.866
My ex-husband's an informant.

42:17.117 --> 42:19.369
It's why this idiot judge
gave him custody.

42:19.620 --> 42:21.579
- Are you joking?
- I wish.

42:21.830 --> 42:26.000
But I was thinking,
if vice dumped him as an informer...

42:26.252 --> 42:28.836
when my appeal
came up in six weeks...

42:29.088 --> 42:32.131
I could then say
my ex-husband is unfit.

42:32.383 --> 42:35.969
- He's such a criminal...
- Wait a minute. He's a criminal?

42:36.262 --> 42:38.304
Your ex? He's a criminal?

42:39.932 --> 42:43.101
He steals wheelchairs.
Thank you very much.

42:45.980 --> 42:48.064
All right, let me see what I can do.

42:48.482 --> 42:51.985
- Good night.
- You know, not having her around...

42:52.945 --> 42:54.654
it's like my heart is missing.

42:55.114 --> 42:57.031
I'm sure.

42:58.242 --> 42:59.951
Let me see what I can do.

43:00.578 --> 43:03.913
Good night.

43:20.347 --> 43:21.681
How much you pay them?

43:22.975 --> 43:24.892
I think they're up to $30 a day.

43:25.144 --> 43:27.520
Subtract room and board,
booze and smokes.

43:27.771 --> 43:31.482
You know, who knows?
Maybe they pay us! Ha, ha, ha!

43:32.693 --> 43:34.736
- Hell of a business.
- It's the best!

43:34.987 --> 43:36.904
We gotta protect it,
my friend, right?

43:37.781 --> 43:41.451
Son, I've been protecting
your family for 20 years.

43:41.744 --> 43:43.453
You're the greatest, man!

43:43.704 --> 43:46.331
I'm saying, until the election,
no more girls, huh?

43:46.957 --> 43:48.833
Bring your wife down here
for a weekend.

43:49.084 --> 43:52.337
What's her name? Alice?
Mary Pat. Mary Pat.

43:53.213 --> 43:57.216
Chris, I met an angel.

43:57.468 --> 44:01.179
I mean, she's a dancer.

44:03.015 --> 44:06.726
She's so pure and clean.
Not like the rest of these whores.

44:06.977 --> 44:08.436
- If I could be with her...
- What?

44:08.687 --> 44:09.729
You'd be a good boy?

44:09.980 --> 44:13.107
I'd be perfect. I'd be perfect.
I swear I would.

44:13.359 --> 44:15.151
I would stop going to clubs.

44:15.402 --> 44:17.111
I would stop drinking.

44:17.321 --> 44:19.822
I would just lead
a regular life, you know?

44:20.074 --> 44:23.785
With my wife and a steady mistress.

44:24.078 --> 44:26.663
And I would have a decent life.

44:27.206 --> 44:29.832
So let's do it!
Where'd you see her?

44:33.879 --> 44:37.090
My brain has just turned to shit.

44:37.341 --> 44:39.509
That's why you're in Congress!

44:43.972 --> 44:45.973
You're probably right.

44:54.942 --> 45:01.155
I look up to the little bird

45:01.323 --> 45:07.620
That glides across the sky

45:10.374 --> 45:16.462
He sings the clearest melody

45:16.630 --> 45:23.428
It makes me want to cry

45:24.430 --> 45:31.102
It makes me want to sit right down
And cry, cry, cry

45:31.270 --> 45:33.187
Yeah

45:33.355 --> 45:39.527
I walk along the city streets

45:39.695 --> 45:45.116
So dark with rage and fear

45:47.327 --> 45:54.959
And I
I wish that I could be that bird

45:55.127 --> 46:01.674
And fly away from here

46:02.843 --> 46:10.433
I wish I had the wings
To fly away from here

46:10.601 --> 46:14.520
But my, my, I feel so low

46:14.688 --> 46:18.399
My, my, where do I go?

46:18.567 --> 46:22.278
My, my, what do I know?

46:22.446 --> 46:26.365
My, my, we reap what we sow

46:26.533 --> 46:29.452
They always said that you knew best

46:29.620 --> 46:34.081
But this little bird's fallen out
Of that nest now

46:34.249 --> 46:38.044
I've got a feeling
That it might have been blessed

46:38.212 --> 46:42.340
So I've just got to put these wings to test

46:55.395 --> 46:56.437
Who is it?

46:56.605 --> 46:59.357
It's Lieutenant Garcia.
Is it a bad time now?

46:59.566 --> 47:01.984
No, just a second.
I was rehearsing.

47:08.700 --> 47:09.742
Morning.

47:10.160 --> 47:12.745
Morning. I was nearby.
I probably should've call...

47:12.996 --> 47:15.206
No, no, it's fine.
Please come on in.

47:16.333 --> 47:17.708
Thank you.

47:18.836 --> 47:21.921
Can I get you some coffee
or English muffin?

47:22.172 --> 47:24.006
No, no, thanks.

47:24.258 --> 47:26.884
You know, I was thinking...

47:27.511 --> 47:29.720
and if I had to guess,
I would say...

47:29.972 --> 47:34.058
that Jerry was probably there
because he was there most nights.

47:34.476 --> 47:36.018
So do you know anything new?

47:36.270 --> 47:38.813
Actually, I have some good news...

47:39.064 --> 47:41.482
and I have some mediocre news.

47:42.276 --> 47:45.403
The good news is Darrell
lost his informant status.

47:46.321 --> 47:47.321
Yes!

47:47.531 --> 47:48.531
9:00 this morning.

47:49.908 --> 47:52.451
Vice thought his information
was bogus anyway.

47:53.120 --> 47:56.622
This is great! Now in six weeks,
I can go to the judge...

47:56.874 --> 47:59.208
That's the mediocre part.

47:59.710 --> 48:03.337
Judge Fingerhut had a heart attack
early this morning...

48:03.547 --> 48:05.423
at a porno theater on Ocean.

48:06.049 --> 48:08.134
- Don't tell me that!
- He was DOA...

48:08.385 --> 48:10.261
at Don Shula Hospital.

48:11.471 --> 48:15.057
Anyway, I called around,
and the earliest...

48:15.309 --> 48:18.060
It'll be six months
before your appeal's heard.

48:18.312 --> 48:19.437
The system is all backed up.

48:19.688 --> 48:23.107
I can't allow her to stay
with him for another six months!

48:23.358 --> 48:26.110
There's nothing you can do
from a legal standpoint.

48:26.320 --> 48:28.195
Absolutely nothing.

48:31.158 --> 48:32.992
I understand.

48:34.453 --> 48:35.953
Is today Friday?

48:36.204 --> 48:37.663
Yeah, it's Friday.

48:38.081 --> 48:39.665
I gotta run now.

49:11.323 --> 49:13.449
- How are you?
- All right.

49:27.714 --> 49:30.132
You're wonderful, Mr. Dilbeck!

49:31.885 --> 49:35.388
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Phil, how you doing?

49:35.555 --> 49:38.599
Shalom, darling. Shalom to you.

49:40.352 --> 49:42.019
Manischewitz!

49:44.606 --> 49:46.732
Congressman. Alan Mordecai.

49:46.984 --> 49:49.151
- Alan, how you been?
- Fine, sir.

49:49.361 --> 49:52.488
Congressman, I brought
a little souvenir for you.

49:52.739 --> 49:56.450
Obviously, the ramifications of that,
if it were to become public...

49:56.702 --> 49:59.578
- Is this me?
- Yes, I'm afraid so.

49:59.830 --> 50:02.707
If this became public,
it would be devastating...

50:02.916 --> 50:05.668
- ...and I'd like to avoid that.
- It's her.

50:07.546 --> 50:09.547
It's my angel.

50:10.966 --> 50:13.926
Heel! Slow down!
Heel, will you? Heel!

50:49.755 --> 50:51.922
Are you going to your house, Mama?

50:52.174 --> 50:53.883
No, we're going to our house.

50:55.093 --> 50:56.177
For the whole day?

50:57.179 --> 50:58.345
Even better.

50:58.847 --> 50:59.847
Really?

51:01.058 --> 51:02.516
Really.

51:15.280 --> 51:17.031
You snatched me, didn't you?

51:21.745 --> 51:22.912
I guess I did.

51:23.371 --> 51:24.455
You sure did.

51:36.301 --> 51:38.594
Come on, pumpkin.
Zippity-doo-dah.

51:49.439 --> 51:51.690
I didn't know she had a child.

51:51.900 --> 51:53.442
Of course you...

51:53.652 --> 51:56.362
She's divorced, but the husband
has custody. Remember?

51:56.613 --> 51:59.031
She's carrying numerous bags.

52:00.700 --> 52:04.870
That doesn't look like just
a visitation, does it, Erb?

52:05.080 --> 52:06.163
I'll look into it.

52:06.414 --> 52:08.874
Check custody status
of Ms. Erin Grant.

52:09.126 --> 52:11.794
God, give me strength.

52:12.671 --> 52:15.297
What an extraordinary creature.

52:15.799 --> 52:19.468
How perfect in every detail.

52:19.678 --> 52:23.055
Davey, you promised you'd behave
until after the election.

52:23.306 --> 52:26.308
You don't understand.
This is love.

52:26.518 --> 52:27.810
Please.

52:28.728 --> 52:30.146
I won't campaign...

52:30.397 --> 52:32.606
until I can possess...

52:32.858 --> 52:35.442
her actual velvet self.

52:35.986 --> 52:39.530
In the meantime, I want you
to bring me something.

52:39.781 --> 52:41.949
Something of hers.

52:42.159 --> 52:43.492
Something...

52:43.743 --> 52:45.703
personal to tide me over.

52:46.997 --> 52:48.080
How personal?

52:49.583 --> 52:51.792
Intensely personal.

53:03.221 --> 53:04.555
Am I a good help?

53:04.806 --> 53:09.059
Honey, you are the best
laundry assistant I've ever had.

53:14.357 --> 53:16.066
All right, let's hit the road, Jack.

53:16.318 --> 53:17.359
Who's Jack?

53:18.153 --> 53:20.321
It's just an expression.
Come on.

54:22.384 --> 54:24.218
This is some picture.

54:26.680 --> 54:27.763
It's fatal.

54:28.848 --> 54:30.599
I don't accede to blackmail.

54:30.809 --> 54:32.518
Willie, I agree with you
in principle...

54:32.727 --> 54:35.521
but this gets out,
we're in a bigtime shitstorm.

54:35.772 --> 54:38.524
Pop, pay the guy off.

54:38.942 --> 54:42.111
You got a cancer,
you talk nice to it?

54:42.362 --> 54:46.156
- No. You cut it out.
- Willie.

54:46.408 --> 54:49.076
We can't operate like
we're in the funeral business.

54:49.411 --> 54:53.289
I'd rather buy cops than
pay blackmail. Understood?

54:54.291 --> 54:57.001
I just think we should
consider other options.

54:57.544 --> 54:58.794
Understood?

55:02.966 --> 55:04.008
Yes.

55:15.312 --> 55:16.729
What else?

55:17.022 --> 55:18.314
A connected matter.

55:18.565 --> 55:21.734
Davey wants to nail this stripper,
and I'd like to use the boat.

55:21.985 --> 55:24.653
That way, we can control
the situation.

55:24.904 --> 55:27.906
- She's the girl from the picture?
- That's correct.

55:28.158 --> 55:31.118
- What does she know?
- Well, we gotta find out.

55:31.328 --> 55:35.080
The good news is she got custody
of her child illegally, so she's vulnerable.

55:35.457 --> 55:37.583
Vulnerable isn't good enough.

55:37.834 --> 55:40.711
I say let Davey have his fun.
Then lose her.

55:42.464 --> 55:44.923
Willie, Willie.

55:45.175 --> 55:48.635
First, let's determine
whether she can hurt us or not.

55:49.554 --> 55:51.263
I'm sure she's just
another dumb whore.

55:52.057 --> 55:54.391
For her sake, I hope so.

55:57.270 --> 56:00.439
Phooey! I go back three.

56:02.609 --> 56:05.944
- This is complicated.
- It's easy.

56:07.822 --> 56:09.281
All right, is it your turn?

56:09.491 --> 56:12.534
You stay here with us,
sweetie. Mama's orders.

56:12.786 --> 56:14.912
Everybody, listen up.

56:15.121 --> 56:18.332
This is Lorelei.

56:19.167 --> 56:21.377
Formerly of the Flesh Farm.

56:21.586 --> 56:25.547
She and her snake, Monty Python,
have signed an exclusive...

56:25.757 --> 56:26.840
contract with us.

56:27.092 --> 56:28.592
You've got a snake?

56:28.843 --> 56:31.804
- Monty.
- And she starts tomorrow.

56:32.430 --> 56:34.556
So why don't we make
her feel at home...

56:34.808 --> 56:38.185
and give her a real
Eager Beaver welcome!

56:38.686 --> 56:39.812
Welcome, darling.

56:40.438 --> 56:42.481
I'm Ariel, Miss Gaza Strip.

56:42.690 --> 56:44.108
I'm Tiffany Glass.

56:46.194 --> 56:48.320
- How big is your snake?
- It's big.

56:48.571 --> 56:50.781
So what brings you here?

56:51.658 --> 56:53.951
Just what we needed, another blonde!

56:54.160 --> 56:55.828
What the hell is that?

56:56.079 --> 56:58.205
It just came from Ling's.

56:58.456 --> 57:00.999
Monty sleeps with the fishes.

57:02.752 --> 57:04.378
Lorelei has no idea, right?

57:04.587 --> 57:06.422
No, it just got here.

57:07.674 --> 57:09.133
It's fresh.

57:09.926 --> 57:11.635
Go rustle up a new snake.

57:11.845 --> 57:15.097
Where? The A&P? Who the fuck
carries pythons at 10:00 at night?

57:15.348 --> 57:18.642
There's an all-night
snake farm on Route 27.

57:18.893 --> 57:20.644
Ask for Jungle Juan.

57:21.938 --> 57:23.063
And get rid of that.

57:23.356 --> 57:25.816
God, I hate this business.

57:26.025 --> 57:27.484
You know why?

57:27.735 --> 57:29.778
It's lost its humanity.

57:30.029 --> 57:33.699
- Say hello to a gorgeous creature...
- Bring change.

57:33.908 --> 57:36.535
The unbelievable Erin Grant!

57:46.754 --> 57:52.885
I look up to the little bird

57:53.052 --> 57:59.308
That glides across the sky

58:02.145 --> 58:08.567
He sings the clearest melody

58:08.735 --> 58:15.073
It makes me want to cry

58:16.242 --> 58:22.789
It makes me want to sit right down
And cry, cry, cry

58:22.957 --> 58:24.082
Yeah

58:25.293 --> 58:31.924
I walk along the city streets

58:32.926 --> 58:34.593
All right!

58:35.303 --> 58:36.803
Yeah!

58:39.057 --> 58:46.813
And I
I wish that I could be that bird

58:46.981 --> 58:53.695
And fly away from here

58:54.739 --> 59:02.120
I wish I had the wings to fly away from here
Yeah

59:03.039 --> 59:06.500
But my, my, I feel so low

59:06.668 --> 59:10.379
My, my, where do I go?

59:10.547 --> 59:14.091
My, my, what do I know?

59:14.259 --> 59:18.220
My, my, we reap what we sow

59:18.388 --> 59:21.390
They always said that you knew best

59:21.558 --> 59:25.852
But this little bird's fallen
Out of that nest now

59:26.020 --> 59:29.106
I've got a feeling
That it might have been blessed

59:29.274 --> 59:35.612
So I've just got to put these wings to test

59:46.165 --> 59:48.500
Because he believes in the family...

59:48.751 --> 59:52.045
in the values that made us
a God-fearing people.

59:52.255 --> 59:55.674
Because he's long been
a friend of this organization.

01:00:04.809 --> 01:00:08.270
Get him out of there.
Preferably with his clothes on.

01:00:14.986 --> 01:00:16.528
David... My God!

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:19.114
Tell me I'm dreaming. Please.

01:00:19.407 --> 01:00:23.493
No, no, no!
I cannot believe this!

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:25.454
No, no, no! Davey, no!

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:27.581
Is this lint fresh?

01:00:27.832 --> 01:00:30.042
Hot out of the Maytag.

01:00:31.919 --> 01:00:34.338
You just can't imagine!

01:00:34.922 --> 01:00:38.383
This is the very essence
of that glorious creature.

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:42.429
I gotta say, even for you,
Davey, this is off the charts!

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:44.014
Why are you shiny?

01:00:45.767 --> 01:00:46.808
It's Vaseline.

01:00:48.686 --> 01:00:51.063
It's Vas...
Great. It's Vaseline.

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:53.940
You've never covered yourself
with Vaseline?

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:55.984
Not unless I have third-degree burns.

01:00:57.779 --> 01:01:01.114
You don't know what you're missing.
I've got it all over.

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:06.036
It's down in my boots. I can feel
it squishing in between my toes.

01:01:06.245 --> 01:01:10.916
All right, okay. Davey,
the Young Christians are waiting so...

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:14.586
- When will I see her?
- It's in the works.

01:01:14.879 --> 01:01:16.546
- When?
- It's in the works!

01:01:17.715 --> 01:01:19.591
Clean yourself up!

01:01:20.301 --> 01:01:24.513
I did not go into politics to pimp
for a twisted old fuck like you!

01:01:24.764 --> 01:01:26.598
I've had it, Davey.

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:29.935
I quit.

01:01:31.771 --> 01:01:34.481
You are such a child.

01:01:35.316 --> 01:01:37.943
Davey! Davey! Davey!

01:01:39.112 --> 01:01:42.656
Onward, Christian soldiers

01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:47.035
Marching as to war

01:01:47.286 --> 01:01:51.331
With the cross of Jesus

01:01:51.624 --> 01:01:55.252
Going on before

01:01:55.461 --> 01:01:59.256
Christ, the royal Master

01:01:59.465 --> 01:02:03.301
Leads against the foe

01:02:03.511 --> 01:02:06.805
Forward into battle

01:02:07.014 --> 01:02:10.851
See his banners go

01:02:11.602 --> 01:02:16.064
Onward, Christian soldiers

01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:19.234
Marching as to war

01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:22.362
Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:02:25.032 --> 01:02:27.826
You are too kind.
You are too kind.

01:02:31.038 --> 01:02:36.042
What a privilege for me to be here
for you good people tonight...

01:02:36.335 --> 01:02:38.920
and to talk about an issue
that is so critical...

01:02:39.172 --> 01:02:43.008
to this campaign and
to all of the American people.

01:02:43.509 --> 01:02:45.844
I'm talking about the issue...

01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:48.555
of family values.

01:03:06.532 --> 01:03:08.742
Where's Monty?
He isn't here yet.

01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:11.453
He's on his way. Relax.

01:03:13.414 --> 01:03:15.207
Do me a favor and watch Angela?

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:17.959
I'm gonna get my car,
it's pouring out.

01:03:18.211 --> 01:03:20.420
- Yeah, sure, gorgeous.
- Thanks.

01:03:23.549 --> 01:03:25.383
Where have you been all night?

01:03:25.593 --> 01:03:29.846
Doing my Christmas shopping early.
Martha Stewart recommends it.

01:03:32.225 --> 01:03:35.477
If that's not a snake,
then it's an amazing belt.

01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:40.065
I gotta find a new line of work.
This shit is getting out of hand.

01:03:40.274 --> 01:03:42.734
Let me put this down
and walk you to your car.

01:03:42.944 --> 01:03:45.070
I'm fine.
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:04:01.754 --> 01:04:04.631
- Evening, everybody.
- Shit!

01:04:04.924 --> 01:04:08.176
- Where's my little 'un?
- Where you can't get her.

01:04:09.262 --> 01:04:12.389
Is that ever the wrong answer.
Bring her to me now!

01:04:12.598 --> 01:04:15.475
I am not bringing her to you
in this lifetime.

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:19.479
I'll go to that judge and tell him
my whore of a wife abducted...

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:22.148
Guess what, Darrell?
The judge is dead.

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.317
So you'll just have to kill me.

01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:27.404
- Go on!
- Think I'm afraid to?

01:04:27.613 --> 01:04:30.115
Think I don't have the manliness
to take your life?

01:04:30.324 --> 01:04:32.450
I think you are all man.

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:37.414
That death row-lethal injection thing?
That's not gonna scare you.

01:04:38.833 --> 01:04:40.834
They'd never execute a daddy.

01:04:41.335 --> 01:04:42.544
Drop the knife.

01:04:42.795 --> 01:04:44.129
You got till three. One.

01:04:44.797 --> 01:04:46.298
Suck my dick.

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:48.550
Whip the little fella out. Two.

01:04:48.801 --> 01:04:51.303
This here is a domestic squabble.

01:04:55.433 --> 01:04:56.683
Three.

01:04:58.144 --> 01:04:59.352
You broke my arm!

01:04:59.645 --> 01:05:01.062
You sure?

01:05:08.487 --> 01:05:10.655
- Bitch!
- Bully!

01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:15.327
Argh! Argh!

01:05:16.871 --> 01:05:18.997
I'm gonna get you!

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:25.337
- Are you okay?
- Just had a tiff with my ex.

01:05:25.546 --> 01:05:29.674
I know what that's like.
Did you see? Monty finally got here.

01:05:29.967 --> 01:05:31.343
That's great, Lorelei.

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:34.721
Hey, baby. Say hi to Erin.

01:05:35.264 --> 01:05:36.514
- Cute.
- Homicide.

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:38.016
Lieutenant Garcia.

01:05:40.353 --> 01:05:42.187
She's a kidnapper!

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.022
Watch your head there.

01:05:45.358 --> 01:05:48.360
The fact is he threatened,
and he did not attempt.

01:05:49.028 --> 01:05:51.863
What if he kills me?
Can I press charges then?

01:05:52.031 --> 01:05:54.532
The law is the law.
I'll screw around here.

01:05:54.742 --> 01:05:59.037
If you like, I'll lose your paperwork.
He makes bail, she's his.

01:06:02.041 --> 01:06:04.709
I should split and
take her to New England.

01:06:05.628 --> 01:06:07.003
Understand this.

01:06:07.213 --> 01:06:10.757
If you split without formal custody,
you'll lose her forever.

01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:14.135
I've dealt with Family Services.
They are pencil pushers.

01:06:14.387 --> 01:06:17.138
- This is by the book.
- I'm dealing with a maniac.

01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:19.933
I understand.
I repeat, you can't take off.

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:22.435
You cannot.

01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:26.398
You might have a bigger problem.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.818
- I can't have a bigger problem!
- Look at this.

01:06:30.403 --> 01:06:33.905
Any of these clowns the one
who might have assaulted Mr. Guber?

01:06:44.417 --> 01:06:45.417
This clown.

01:06:46.752 --> 01:06:49.671
- You're positive?
- Absolutely.

01:06:50.965 --> 01:06:54.092
Who is he? He looks
like that guy on F Troop.

01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:57.095
That's Congressman Dilbeck.

01:06:57.805 --> 01:06:59.431
This nut is a congressman?

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:02.767
You haven't heard from him?
From any of his staff?

01:07:03.477 --> 01:07:04.561
No.

01:07:05.813 --> 01:07:06.813
Wait.

01:07:08.107 --> 01:07:10.358
This is who
Jerry was talking about.

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:13.611
Are you saying I am in danger
from a congressman?

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:14.863
No.

01:07:17.658 --> 01:07:19.951
Let me know if you hear
from him though.

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:22.787
I think that's in both our interests.

01:07:23.789 --> 01:07:25.790
How did I get so popular?

01:07:28.169 --> 01:07:32.130
Hush, little baby Don't you cry

01:07:32.339 --> 01:07:37.469
Mama's gonna buy you a something

01:07:38.137 --> 01:07:40.138
Pumpkin pie.

01:07:40.806 --> 01:07:42.640
You're awake.

01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:45.477
- Can Mommy put you down?
- No.

01:07:45.686 --> 01:07:47.312
Fair enough.

01:08:08.292 --> 01:08:09.334
Mommy.

01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:11.711
- Brush your teeth.
- I'm too tired.

01:08:12.004 --> 01:08:14.839
Okay, don't brush your teeth.
Go on to bed.

01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:22.930
"Mr. Dilbeck requests the pleasure
of your company for a private dance."

01:08:23.182 --> 01:08:27.018
You'll receive $2,000 cash
for a one-hour set.

01:08:27.185 --> 01:08:32.148
"Obviously, discretion and confidentiality
are of the utmost importance."

01:08:42.868 --> 01:08:45.453
Mommy, do you like dancing?

01:08:46.205 --> 01:08:47.580
Why are you still awake?

01:08:47.872 --> 01:08:51.084
I was just thinking.
Do you like dancing?

01:08:51.377 --> 01:08:52.544
Not really.

01:08:52.752 --> 01:08:55.212
- It's not fun?
- No.

01:08:55.923 --> 01:08:57.715
You're just dancing.

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:02.053
Just dancing's fun, honey.
Sure, that part of the job.

01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:04.805
What's not fun? The customers?

01:09:05.057 --> 01:09:08.184
Urbana said some of them
are mean and stupid.

01:09:11.604 --> 01:09:14.064
Pumpkin, have you ever seen me dance?

01:09:17.403 --> 01:09:18.403
Have you?

01:09:19.446 --> 01:09:22.407
- I told the girls that...
- I came out tonight.

01:09:27.246 --> 01:09:28.412
While I was dancing?

01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:36.212
You looked really pretty.

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:38.089
No, I didn't.

01:09:38.506 --> 01:09:41.134
Yeah, you did.
You looked great.

01:09:47.224 --> 01:09:48.850
Thank you, baby.

01:09:53.104 --> 01:09:55.106
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:09:55.316 --> 01:09:58.234
Welcome to the
Miami Seaquarium's Top Deck.

01:09:59.612 --> 01:10:04.657
We are going to celebrate the oceans
and all the living things in them...

01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:09.162
as we proudly present to you
a splash of the islands.

01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:15.793
Okay, now, I need all
the camp kids to come with me.

01:10:16.795 --> 01:10:18.129
Come on. You too.

01:10:19.632 --> 01:10:22.842
It's okay. You can go.
Go on. It's all right.

01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:26.638
I'll be right here.

01:10:29.558 --> 01:10:30.975
Don't worry.

01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:34.312
She's spent so little time with kids...

01:10:34.521 --> 01:10:37.273
It'll change.
Once she's with you full-time.

01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:39.150
I hope so.

01:10:39.818 --> 01:10:42.862
Let me get this straight.
He offered you two grand?

01:10:43.364 --> 01:10:45.156
To dance for one hour?

01:10:47.493 --> 01:10:51.162
- I don't know.
- I can't turn it down, Al.

01:10:51.372 --> 01:10:55.708
Now that I have Angie with me,
I've gotta find another job immediately.

01:10:56.001 --> 01:10:59.337
Which will pay me nothing
compared to what I'm making now.

01:11:00.172 --> 01:11:01.673
But, you know...

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:05.176
she saw me last night.
Can you imagine?

01:11:07.721 --> 01:11:09.097
Was she upset?

01:11:09.348 --> 01:11:12.684
She said no, but come on.
One day she's gonna realize...

01:11:12.893 --> 01:11:14.686
and say, "That was my mother."

01:11:19.358 --> 01:11:22.527
How about you? You ready
to feed Flipper? Step here.

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.320
My God.

01:11:27.199 --> 01:11:29.826
- It's safe, though, right?
- What?

01:11:30.035 --> 01:11:33.037
With Dilbeck. I'm bringing Shad.

01:11:33.205 --> 01:11:37.417
I think as long as they think you
don't know anything, you'll be fine.

01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:38.835
Keep your ears open.

01:11:39.878 --> 01:11:41.421
What will you do with her tonight?

01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:42.755
Urbana said that she'd...

01:11:43.048 --> 01:11:45.883
Why don't you drop her
off at our house?

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.261
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

01:11:48.554 --> 01:11:51.431
I told Donna everything.
Your whole situation.

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:54.559
She said if you needed a hand
she'd love to help.

01:11:54.768 --> 01:11:57.770
She doesn't think I'm something
out of A Current Affair?

01:11:58.147 --> 01:12:01.899
Come on, you're a terrific girl.
You know that.

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:05.945
So you made a mistake. You married
a bum. What are you gonna do?

01:12:06.155 --> 01:12:08.781
You gonna beat yourself up
for the rest of your life?

01:12:09.783 --> 01:12:12.577
Well, I usually don't,
but it's...

01:12:14.079 --> 01:12:15.663
I mean, it's just that...

01:12:15.914 --> 01:12:18.291
you know, she saw me dancing.

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:20.585
Yeah.

01:12:22.296 --> 01:12:23.463
It'll all work out.

01:12:24.089 --> 01:12:26.758
I want her free and clear,
whatever it takes.

01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:34.891
Good job, baby!

01:13:02.461 --> 01:13:05.505
- You're Mrs. Grant?
- No, I'm Barbara Bush.

01:13:05.923 --> 01:13:08.132
- Who is he?
- George Bush.

01:13:08.634 --> 01:13:10.134
George Bush is not invited.

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:13.471
Take a hike.

01:13:13.639 --> 01:13:15.139
No, no.

01:13:15.516 --> 01:13:17.517
See, if he goes, I go.

01:13:20.646 --> 01:13:22.814
Raise your hands.
I gotta pat you down.

01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:25.441
Stop.

01:13:27.486 --> 01:13:28.861
Right this way.

01:13:48.507 --> 01:13:55.054
Your lips and mine
Two sips of wine

01:13:55.222 --> 01:13:59.809
Memories are made of this

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:06.149
Then add the wedding bells

01:14:06.316 --> 01:14:08.693
One house where lovers dwell

01:14:08.861 --> 01:14:13.531
Hello, Erin.
My name is Congressman Dilbeck.

01:14:14.616 --> 01:14:17.869
You are... You're a beauty.

01:14:18.036 --> 01:14:23.332
Stir carefully through the days
See how the flavor stays

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.293
Good evening.

01:14:26.712 --> 01:14:28.045
I'm Erin Grant.

01:14:31.717 --> 01:14:33.593
And you must be...

01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:36.596
Convak Dilvak.

01:14:38.265 --> 01:14:39.599
Congressman Dildo.

01:14:42.769 --> 01:14:44.770
I am Congressman David Dilbeck.

01:14:45.898 --> 01:14:48.232
And welcome, welcome.

01:14:49.776 --> 01:14:51.277
Welcome.

01:14:52.738 --> 01:14:54.655
You are truly, truly welcome.

01:14:54.907 --> 01:14:55.907
Thank you.

01:14:56.617 --> 01:14:58.784
Have we ever met before?

01:14:59.036 --> 01:15:00.912
No, no, no, no, no.

01:15:01.538 --> 01:15:03.748
But actually, I have seen...

01:15:04.416 --> 01:15:07.793
many, many beautiful
photographs of you.

01:15:10.255 --> 01:15:12.840
Well, I'm honored.
And a congressman.

01:15:13.258 --> 01:15:17.303
Very successful congressman
you must be.

01:15:17.971 --> 01:15:19.138
This is not my boat.

01:15:20.307 --> 01:15:23.601
It belongs to a very
close friend of mine.

01:15:24.269 --> 01:15:26.938
Do you like Dino?

01:15:30.108 --> 01:15:34.654
Dean's great, yeah.
But you know, I've brought my own.

01:15:34.947 --> 01:15:37.823
Do you care for The Artist
Formerly Known as Prince?

01:15:37.991 --> 01:15:40.785
Fold in lightly with a dream

01:15:41.662 --> 01:15:43.287
I care for you.

01:15:43.455 --> 01:15:46.332
Your lips and mine

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:50.086
So, George, you get to watch
any of the auditions?

01:15:50.462 --> 01:15:53.381
- Watch, my ass. I do the hiring.
- No, no, no.

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:54.799
I've seen every girl in Florida.

01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:58.135
What are the criteria?
Monster jugs?

01:15:58.470 --> 01:16:00.888
Firmness is crucial.

01:16:01.139 --> 01:16:04.016
I gotta hold them for a while.
Shake them.

01:16:05.227 --> 01:16:06.227
You shake their tits?

01:16:06.728 --> 01:16:11.357
It ain't no picnic, man.
Got tendinitis in my right wrist.

01:16:11.817 --> 01:16:14.026
On a rainy day, it's agony.

01:16:15.737 --> 01:16:17.196
You audition anybody famous?

01:16:17.656 --> 01:16:20.491
- What?
- You know, before they were famous.

01:16:22.869 --> 01:16:24.495
Sure did.

01:16:24.913 --> 01:16:26.497
Meryl Streep.

01:16:27.749 --> 01:16:29.834
Come on! Meryl Streep stripped?

01:16:31.169 --> 01:16:33.004
One of the best.

01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:35.715
Chesty La France.

01:16:37.050 --> 01:16:38.718
That was Meryl.

01:16:40.721 --> 01:16:42.847
Chesty La France. I heard of her.

01:17:03.493 --> 01:17:04.785
Ooh!

01:17:05.537 --> 01:17:07.580
I give you anything you want.

01:17:07.873 --> 01:17:09.707
A diamond ring.

01:17:10.208 --> 01:17:11.250
A Lexus.

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:13.878
I'll get you a condo on the beach.

01:17:14.087 --> 01:17:15.421
Just be my girlfriend.

01:17:15.964 --> 01:17:18.382
- Can't do that.
- Why not?

01:17:19.718 --> 01:17:22.219
I love you.

01:17:22.554 --> 01:17:25.556
You don't know what
I've done for you recently.

01:17:25.891 --> 01:17:28.267
Really? And what was that?

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:32.104
I talked to Judge Fingerhut
about your daughter.

01:17:33.065 --> 01:17:34.315
You did?

01:17:35.233 --> 01:17:37.693
And how did you know about my case?

01:17:38.779 --> 01:17:39.987
Little birdie told me.

01:17:40.447 --> 01:17:43.908
It must have been a little old
birdie who knew me very well.

01:17:44.576 --> 01:17:45.701
"Who" is not important.

01:17:46.286 --> 01:17:47.912
Come on now.

01:17:48.955 --> 01:17:51.123
Not just a little hint.

01:17:52.084 --> 01:17:54.460
I can't do that.

01:17:57.589 --> 01:17:59.590
But I know the new judge.

01:18:00.425 --> 01:18:04.303
He's a very good friend of mine.
The Honorable Jack Goldberg.

01:18:06.098 --> 01:18:07.723
He'll be more amenable.

01:18:09.935 --> 01:18:14.021
Darling, if you just come
into Davey's life...

01:18:14.439 --> 01:18:16.440
good things will happen.

01:18:16.733 --> 01:18:18.818
You don't know how much
I worship you.

01:18:20.153 --> 01:18:21.654
How much?

01:18:22.114 --> 01:18:26.450
I sent my aide, Erb,
over to your Laundromat.

01:18:26.618 --> 01:18:30.037
He brought back some of your lint.

01:18:30.956 --> 01:18:31.956
My lint?

01:18:32.749 --> 01:18:33.791
Fresh...

01:18:34.459 --> 01:18:36.293
hot lint.

01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:43.467
And what did you do
with that fresh, hot lint?

01:18:45.011 --> 01:18:47.138
I'm afraid I made love to it.

01:18:53.019 --> 01:18:56.480
Close your eyes.
I've got a little surprise for you.

01:18:56.773 --> 01:18:58.524
Keep them closed.

01:18:58.775 --> 01:19:00.860
No peeking.

01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:05.406
Don't invade my private life again...

01:19:05.574 --> 01:19:07.324
or I'll kill you. You understand?

01:19:07.534 --> 01:19:09.452
Show's over, big boy.

01:19:10.871 --> 01:19:12.997
This is abnormal.

01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:17.543
You'll come back tomorrow?
Same time?

01:19:17.794 --> 01:19:19.170
I don't think so.

01:19:19.379 --> 01:19:21.714
I'll give you $5,000.

01:19:21.923 --> 01:19:25.384
Five thousand dollars for no sex?
You love me that much.

01:19:26.094 --> 01:19:30.347
Just the touch of your hand
sets my pecker on fire.

01:19:30.932 --> 01:19:33.184
Maybe you should see a doctor.

01:19:33.393 --> 01:19:34.560
Same time tomorrow?

01:19:35.687 --> 01:19:38.189
If I come, can we talk more
about my case?

01:19:38.398 --> 01:19:41.400
We can talk about anything.
As long as you're naked.

01:19:42.944 --> 01:19:44.403
We'll see.

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:54.038
Good evening.

01:19:54.372 --> 01:19:55.706
Good evening.

01:19:55.916 --> 01:19:58.876
You don't know me.
I'm Malcolm Moldovsky.

01:19:59.085 --> 01:20:00.753
Dilbeck's right hand.

01:20:01.922 --> 01:20:03.464
You must be a very busy man.

01:20:05.717 --> 01:20:06.967
TouchÃ©.

01:20:07.969 --> 01:20:09.929
I wish to give you some advice...

01:20:10.222 --> 01:20:12.848
about your adorable
little daughter, Angela.

01:20:13.099 --> 01:20:16.894
- What about her?
- Your custody of her is illegal.

01:20:17.896 --> 01:20:20.731
That's just temporary
until the appeal gets heard...

01:20:20.941 --> 01:20:23.651
Please, please, Miss Grant.

01:20:23.902 --> 01:20:26.153
Really, it's of no concern to us.

01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:30.366
As long as you refuse to cooperate
with certain individuals...

01:20:30.575 --> 01:20:33.911
who seek to harm
and slur Congressman Dilbeck...

01:20:34.913 --> 01:20:37.623
for their own selfish
political gain.

01:20:44.381 --> 01:20:47.508
I don't know what you're
talking about. Excuse me.

01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:50.135
Perhaps you don't.

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:54.306
But what a pity if Angela were
to be placed in a state home.

01:20:54.599 --> 01:20:55.975
Pretty grim, most of them.

01:20:56.768 --> 01:20:59.937
A lot of strange people working there.

01:21:00.188 --> 01:21:05.025
I'd recommend that you cooperate
with us for the child's sake.

01:21:05.777 --> 01:21:09.780
Which means you talk
to no one about tonight...

01:21:11.283 --> 01:21:12.908
or any night.

01:21:14.786 --> 01:21:15.828
Understood?

01:21:17.372 --> 01:21:18.372
Of course.

01:21:20.792 --> 01:21:21.917
Good.

01:21:22.294 --> 01:21:23.961
Now if you'll excuse me...

01:21:24.129 --> 01:21:27.047
I'd better toss the congressman
into a cold shower.

01:21:30.343 --> 01:21:33.554
By the way, I can see why
he's so taken by your charms.

01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:36.640
Good night.

01:21:38.977 --> 01:21:40.644
Watch your step on the gangplank.

01:21:49.029 --> 01:21:51.238
She ain't dumb enough.

01:21:56.328 --> 01:21:58.829
- Try anything?
- No.

01:21:59.539 --> 01:22:01.248
He ask you back?

01:22:02.834 --> 01:22:04.001
No.

01:22:04.878 --> 01:22:07.338
Aren't we Miss Talkative tonight?

01:22:08.173 --> 01:22:09.506
I'm a little tired.

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:16.055
What's the matter, baby?
Come on.

01:22:20.185 --> 01:22:21.685
Monty.

01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:26.357
- All right!
- Yeah.

01:22:29.903 --> 01:22:32.029
This reptile's a freaking lemon.

01:22:32.238 --> 01:22:33.864
Who are you?

01:22:34.366 --> 01:22:35.366
Help!

01:22:40.121 --> 01:22:41.747
- So how did it go?
- Fine.

01:22:42.207 --> 01:22:45.042
- No problems?
- No, none.

01:22:46.544 --> 01:22:48.253
But no information.

01:22:50.548 --> 01:22:51.715
Zero.

01:22:51.883 --> 01:22:54.718
Look, I gotta run, you know.
Angela's wiped.

01:22:54.928 --> 01:22:57.096
I'll see you later, okay?

01:23:03.728 --> 01:23:05.104
Come on, come on!

01:23:05.939 --> 01:23:07.898
Come on, you can do it!

01:23:08.233 --> 01:23:10.234
Get this off of me.

01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:11.735
Do something!

01:23:11.903 --> 01:23:15.072
I'm doing something.
I'm protecting you.

01:23:15.573 --> 01:23:18.575
- Stand back.
- My God. What a show.

01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:21.620
That's not Monty!

01:23:22.747 --> 01:23:25.040
You're fine, hon. You'll be fine.

01:23:25.291 --> 01:23:27.084
Who was that snake?

01:23:27.419 --> 01:23:29.253
It doesn't look bad.

01:23:31.089 --> 01:23:32.589
What happened here?

01:23:33.925 --> 01:23:35.926
We got a problem with a dead snake.

01:23:36.428 --> 01:23:38.053
Gee, that's funny.

01:23:39.264 --> 01:23:40.264
So do I.

01:23:42.058 --> 01:23:46.145
Here's that brilliant, charming
attorney of yours, Mr. Mordecai.

01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:52.818
Found him 400 yards offshore.
Now show him the rest of his kisser.

01:23:55.196 --> 01:23:58.657
Crabs find lawyers
a particular delicacy.

01:23:59.325 --> 01:24:00.451
Looks like lasagna.

01:24:01.619 --> 01:24:03.120
Cover that shit up.

01:24:03.288 --> 01:24:06.999
You wanna tell me why your name
was on his calendar for tomorrow?

01:24:07.792 --> 01:24:11.378
I was involved in litigation
with a yogurt company.

01:24:13.339 --> 01:24:16.175
From my limited experience,
this isn't something...

01:24:16.468 --> 01:24:19.136
a yogurt company
would ordinarily do.

01:24:19.471 --> 01:24:22.473
He represented the kid
who got mauled at your club.

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:25.809
Now that I find fascinating, Shad.

01:24:26.186 --> 01:24:28.145
He had a picture.

01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:30.856
Man, I'm gonna lose it.

01:24:31.107 --> 01:24:33.317
No, no. A picture of what?

01:24:34.736 --> 01:24:35.819
A legislator?

01:24:36.362 --> 01:24:38.739
Yeah, beating a kid's ass.

01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:41.992
- Where's the original?
- I got no idea.

01:24:44.329 --> 01:24:45.829
Here, freshen up.

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:49.750
All right, thanks.

01:24:50.001 --> 01:24:52.753
- Can I interest you in dessert?
- Just the check.

01:24:53.004 --> 01:24:55.506
- Come here.
- Ha, ha, ha.

01:24:56.216 --> 01:24:59.009
- Dilbeck didn't invite her back?
- She said no.

01:24:59.219 --> 01:25:03.722
That's good. I don't think she should
go there again, even with you.

01:25:04.724 --> 01:25:06.892
She seemed all edgy tonight.

01:25:07.143 --> 01:25:10.187
Man, she got her moods.
Could be that time of month.

01:25:10.396 --> 01:25:14.191
So you're like the gynecologist-bouncer,
bouncer-gynecologist.

01:25:15.068 --> 01:25:17.945
- I just watch out for the girl.
- So do I.

01:25:18.196 --> 01:25:21.240
That's a grand total
of two people in Florida.

01:25:21.449 --> 01:25:25.452
The higher-ups in my department
aren't pushing this investigation.

01:25:25.703 --> 01:25:28.038
- Because of this asshole congressman?
- Bingo.

01:25:28.248 --> 01:25:31.458
We got two homicides here,
and nobody gives a shit.

01:25:31.751 --> 01:25:33.961
And I'm worried about that girl.

01:25:35.296 --> 01:25:37.214
She's out there all by herself.

01:26:11.207 --> 01:26:12.958
Where's the sheriff?

01:26:27.432 --> 01:26:29.266
Hello, city desk?

01:26:41.487 --> 01:26:43.822
It is an unusual time
for a news conference...

01:26:44.115 --> 01:26:46.617
but the congressman feels
it will dramatize his message.

01:26:46.826 --> 01:26:48.243
We'll send a camera crew.

01:26:48.453 --> 01:26:51.246
- Confirm?
- There won't be any need to confirm.

01:26:51.456 --> 01:26:53.290
- Got everything.
- Thank you.

01:26:53.458 --> 01:26:55.959
Good morning, pumpkin.
How'd you sleep?

01:26:56.252 --> 01:26:57.836
Good. How about you?

01:26:58.129 --> 01:27:00.339
Well, I just...
I slept great, honey.

01:27:07.847 --> 01:27:08.889
Want some cereal?

01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:10.974
Not right now.

01:27:14.479 --> 01:27:16.355
- Good morning.
- Hello, CNN?

01:27:16.564 --> 01:27:18.273
- May I help you?
- News desk.

01:27:18.483 --> 01:27:19.900
One second, please.

01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:21.401
This is Jennifer...

01:27:21.653 --> 01:27:24.529
and I'm calling from
Congressman Dilbeck's office.

01:27:24.781 --> 01:27:27.366
Malcolm Moldovsky asked me to call...

01:27:27.575 --> 01:27:29.660
about the news conference
at the refinery.

01:27:31.454 --> 01:27:32.829
Mm-hm.

01:27:39.671 --> 01:27:42.673
Quit moving!

01:27:44.676 --> 01:27:46.343
Whose Mercedes is that?

01:27:46.552 --> 01:27:49.930
- Some orthodontist from Tampa.
- God, what would Mom say?

01:27:50.181 --> 01:27:52.432
She'd say, "Nice fucking car."

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:55.185
You got a mouth like a sewer!

01:27:56.521 --> 01:27:58.188
I need some morphine.

01:27:58.439 --> 01:28:00.190
I don't got none for humans.

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:01.525
What do you mean?

01:28:01.818 --> 01:28:04.361
All's I got is some
from when Lupa had her cubs.

01:28:04.612 --> 01:28:06.905
- Wolf morphine?
- I don't know. I think so.

01:28:07.115 --> 01:28:10.242
So give me. I'm dying.
Busted arm, two nights in jail.

01:28:10.535 --> 01:28:12.244
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Darrell!

01:28:16.207 --> 01:28:17.332
How'd you break it?

01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:21.211
Playing polo with Donald Trump, okay?

01:28:23.381 --> 01:28:27.259
It says here you take two
every four hours with a bowl of milk.

01:28:27.969 --> 01:28:29.761
Sounds good to me.

01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:31.888
I said two!

01:28:32.890 --> 01:28:34.766
Goddamn it!

01:28:47.947 --> 01:28:51.408
You have to throw down a spade,
another seven, unless you have an eight.

01:28:51.617 --> 01:28:53.118
Then you can change suits.

01:28:53.745 --> 01:28:57.748
So that's why
they call it Crazy Eights.

01:28:58.374 --> 01:28:59.875
When are you coming back?

01:29:00.084 --> 01:29:02.502
By two. But I hope
you will be asleep.

01:29:02.795 --> 01:29:05.505
We'll take care of her.
Don't worry.

01:29:07.467 --> 01:29:08.467
You're going out?

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:11.094
I'll be back by two.
I'll dance the late shift.

01:29:11.387 --> 01:29:13.972
- Can you tell me where you...?
- No, I can't.

01:29:17.518 --> 01:29:20.020
- You be good, pumpkin.
- I will.

01:29:21.105 --> 01:29:22.481
She'll be fine.

01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:24.775
Don't worry.

01:29:24.984 --> 01:29:25.984
See you, baby.

01:29:28.446 --> 01:29:30.280
You're going to the boat?

01:29:33.409 --> 01:29:34.409
Not without me.

01:29:36.454 --> 01:29:38.246
I'll be late.

01:29:38.456 --> 01:29:39.498
Listen up.

01:29:39.707 --> 01:29:42.125
- You said you weren't going.
- I didn't want anybody to know.

01:29:42.335 --> 01:29:43.502
- Like who?
- Garcia.

01:29:43.795 --> 01:29:46.296
Then just say, "Don't tell Garcia."
What's up?

01:29:46.506 --> 01:29:49.549
They'll put Angela in a foster home
if I don't keep my mouth shut.

01:29:49.801 --> 01:29:53.637
- Says who?
- Dilbeck's guy, that creep Moldovsky.

01:29:53.805 --> 01:29:58.183
Promise me you will stay with her
every second. I need to know that.

01:29:58.476 --> 01:30:00.310
I can't let you go there alone.

01:30:00.478 --> 01:30:04.356
They're gonna pay me $5,000.
I need the money.

01:30:04.732 --> 01:30:07.984
I need to get out of here and
live a normal, fully-dressed life...

01:30:08.236 --> 01:30:10.654
with shopping lists
and school buses.

01:30:10.988 --> 01:30:13.365
If they wanted to kill me,
they would have.

01:30:13.699 --> 01:30:15.158
Let me get this straight.

01:30:15.326 --> 01:30:18.537
So you gonna go there, dance
and come back here.

01:30:19.163 --> 01:30:20.247
Correct.

01:30:21.374 --> 01:30:22.499
Something's up.

01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:24.835
I've got it under control.

01:30:25.086 --> 01:30:27.838
Promise me you'll stay
with Angela every second.

01:30:31.717 --> 01:30:34.094
- I'll see you later.
- Erin.

01:30:43.771 --> 01:30:45.355
- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir.

01:31:40.912 --> 01:31:41.912
Sorry.

01:31:45.249 --> 01:31:46.833
You speak English?

01:31:48.252 --> 01:31:49.753
Sometime.

01:31:50.671 --> 01:31:53.590
What do you think
about the people you work for?

01:31:54.926 --> 01:31:56.259
They're filth.

01:31:56.469 --> 01:31:58.762
Exploiters of the poor.

01:32:00.264 --> 01:32:03.308
I think you and I are gonna
get along just fine.

01:32:05.853 --> 01:32:09.940
For $5,000, I expect to get laid.
It's only human.

01:32:10.149 --> 01:32:11.691
Davey, listen to me.

01:32:11.943 --> 01:32:14.611
That beautiful lady
doesn't understand.

01:32:14.862 --> 01:32:19.616
She doesn't understand what it's like
to make love to a congressman.

01:32:19.784 --> 01:32:21.451
The ecstasy, the wonderful...

01:32:21.702 --> 01:32:24.788
Listen to me, you sick fuck!

01:32:25.122 --> 01:32:27.499
She's been meeting with a cop.

01:32:27.833 --> 01:32:29.626
Maybe he's from the titty squad.

01:32:29.835 --> 01:32:31.461
He's homicide.

01:32:31.796 --> 01:32:34.381
She used to work
at the FBI as a secretary.

01:32:34.632 --> 01:32:38.343
This bitch is poison.
She's out to slaughter us.

01:32:38.844 --> 01:32:40.845
Make a fool of me.

01:32:42.181 --> 01:32:46.017
Screw yourself bowlegged,
Davey of the Navy.

01:32:47.186 --> 01:32:49.813
Then let us handle it.
I'll be on the top deck.

01:32:56.654 --> 01:32:58.822
I thought she cared for me.

01:33:11.127 --> 01:33:12.168
We're heavy.

01:33:14.005 --> 01:33:15.046
Copy.

01:33:15.673 --> 01:33:17.340
No cheating.

01:33:17.508 --> 01:33:20.427
- One, two, three...
- Doesn't look good.

01:33:20.595 --> 01:33:22.637
- Whee!
- Can't get a break.

01:33:24.515 --> 01:33:27.684
Shad's a loser. Shad's a loser.

01:33:28.144 --> 01:33:30.186
Yo! Yo!

01:33:30.396 --> 01:33:32.188
All right, Miss Angela.

01:33:32.565 --> 01:33:33.648
Six!

01:33:33.858 --> 01:33:35.900
She always gets six.

01:34:15.566 --> 01:34:18.902
Sweet dreams are made of this

01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:22.572
Who am I to disagree?

01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:26.534
I travel the world and the seven seas

01:34:26.702 --> 01:34:30.121
Everybody's looking for something

01:34:30.289 --> 01:34:34.042
Some of them want to use you

01:34:34.752 --> 01:34:37.253
Down, Bowser. Be patient.

01:34:37.463 --> 01:34:38.755
Don't tease me!

01:34:39.423 --> 01:34:42.717
I'm not teasing.
You just sit back...

01:34:42.927 --> 01:34:45.011
relax, have yourself another drink.

01:34:45.513 --> 01:34:48.848
Because tonight is the night.

01:34:52.228 --> 01:34:53.603
It sure is.

01:34:57.858 --> 01:35:02.320
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?

01:35:06.951 --> 01:35:08.618
Who are you?

01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:10.286
I want my daughter.

01:35:11.122 --> 01:35:14.374
What? Chico!
How'd you get onboard?

01:35:14.834 --> 01:35:17.043
My little 'un. I want her.

01:35:18.254 --> 01:35:22.173
Your "little 'un,"
whoever she is, is not here.

01:35:24.468 --> 01:35:25.468
Chico!

01:35:25.970 --> 01:35:27.846
Keep your head up Moving on

01:35:30.474 --> 01:35:31.975
What's this?

01:35:32.643 --> 01:35:35.562
- Damn!
- Yeah, look...

01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:46.781
Well, there's a sight
to raise the dead.

01:35:48.325 --> 01:35:50.493
Who's that old freak?

01:35:52.288 --> 01:35:54.289
Hold on a second.

01:35:54.665 --> 01:35:56.416
I know who that is.

01:35:56.667 --> 01:35:58.918
Is that the...? Hey.

01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:02.881
Is that that guy
from Price Is Right?

01:36:03.924 --> 01:36:05.341
- Hey!
- Argh!

01:36:06.177 --> 01:36:08.178
Damn.

01:36:10.598 --> 01:36:12.432
You got my daughter...

01:36:12.683 --> 01:36:15.059
and now you try
and kill me with a ax!

01:36:15.686 --> 01:36:19.689
I don't have your daughter!
You're confused.

01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:23.318
And it's "an" axe.

01:36:23.861 --> 01:36:25.945
I'm stoned...

01:36:26.739 --> 01:36:29.949
- ...but I ain't confused.
- Hey. Hey!

01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:33.244
You stole my little 'un!

01:36:33.913 --> 01:36:37.290
Sweet dreams are made of this

01:36:37.458 --> 01:36:40.001
Who am I to disagree?

01:36:42.379 --> 01:36:44.464
Before we make love,
I wish to shave you.

01:36:45.216 --> 01:36:46.841
I don't need a shave.

01:36:47.009 --> 01:36:50.887
Everybody's looking for something
Some of them want to use you

01:36:51.055 --> 01:36:52.764
Evening, partygoers.

01:36:52.932 --> 01:36:56.059
Some of them want to get used by you

01:36:56.227 --> 01:36:59.938
Some of them want to abuse you

01:37:00.439 --> 01:37:04.609
Some of them want to be abused

01:37:15.913 --> 01:37:19.207
Sweet dreams are made of this

01:37:19.375 --> 01:37:22.794
Who am I to disagree?

01:37:22.962 --> 01:37:25.755
I travel the world and the seven seas

01:37:26.131 --> 01:37:27.298
Where's Erin?

01:37:27.591 --> 01:37:30.635
Everybody's looking for something

01:37:31.470 --> 01:37:33.012
I don't hear you.

01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:35.306
Bullshit.

01:37:42.398 --> 01:37:45.108
Hold your head up
Keep your head up

01:37:45.276 --> 01:37:46.484
Tiffany!

01:37:46.652 --> 01:37:48.152
Hold your head up Moving on

01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:50.029
Keep your head up Moving on

01:37:50.197 --> 01:37:51.906
Hold your head up Moving on

01:37:52.074 --> 01:37:53.867
Keep your head up Moving on

01:37:54.034 --> 01:37:55.785
Hold your head up Moving on

01:37:55.953 --> 01:37:57.328
Keep your head up

01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:00.832
Yeah!

01:38:02.376 --> 01:38:05.545
- Tiffany!
- Here we go, babe! Here we go!

01:38:13.470 --> 01:38:16.973
Sweet dreams are made of this

01:38:17.141 --> 01:38:20.643
Who am I to disagree?

01:38:20.811 --> 01:38:24.480
I travel the world and the seven seas

01:38:24.648 --> 01:38:27.817
Everybody's looking for something

01:38:28.986 --> 01:38:29.986
Is Mommy okay?

01:38:30.195 --> 01:38:33.156
She's fine, honey.
We're gonna pick her up now.

01:38:33.365 --> 01:38:36.326
We'll play card games,
have some fun!

01:38:37.703 --> 01:38:39.495
She won't like this.
She told me...

01:38:39.705 --> 01:38:43.583
I don't care what she told you!
How could you let her go alone?

01:38:43.918 --> 01:38:46.628
- I thought you were in jail.
- I made my bail.

01:38:46.879 --> 01:38:49.047
- This son of a bitch your...?
- Hang on.

01:38:49.256 --> 01:38:52.842
Here's your nickel. Nice dance.

01:38:53.135 --> 01:38:57.680
Would you please just get out of here?

01:38:59.725 --> 01:39:04.020
Hey. Are you that guy
from Price Is Right?

01:39:04.271 --> 01:39:08.316
No. I'm Congressman David Dilbeck.

01:39:08.567 --> 01:39:09.567
Congressman?

01:39:09.818 --> 01:39:11.319
- Yeah.
- No shit?

01:39:11.570 --> 01:39:13.071
Well, I steal wheelchairs...

01:39:13.322 --> 01:39:15.573
so we got a lot in common.

01:39:16.283 --> 01:39:20.370
I'm getting tired. I think
I just killed a lying weasel.

01:39:20.579 --> 01:39:21.829
You did what?

01:39:22.081 --> 01:39:24.582
Beat him with this here club.

01:39:24.833 --> 01:39:28.086
Well then, get out!
And leave us alone!

01:39:28.337 --> 01:39:30.713
I'm about to mount this here beauty.

01:39:32.007 --> 01:39:33.341
Maybe not.

01:39:33.592 --> 01:39:36.844
You're talking about my wife.

01:39:38.889 --> 01:39:41.224
It's time for us
to take a little drive.

01:39:42.685 --> 01:39:44.143
Malcolm.

01:39:46.188 --> 01:39:47.689
Malcolm!

01:39:53.821 --> 01:39:57.281
- Move it, move it!
- Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

01:40:15.050 --> 01:40:16.884
Get on... Keep quiet!

01:40:18.429 --> 01:40:21.431
- Pick a good one. Take it!
- Hurry it up!

01:40:21.974 --> 01:40:23.224
Shit, look at this.

01:40:23.809 --> 01:40:25.560
Help me, you assholes.

01:40:27.187 --> 01:40:28.771
Help!

01:40:32.484 --> 01:40:33.818
Stop! Stop!

01:40:34.862 --> 01:40:39.407
I voted against gun control.
Weapons could end up in the wrong hands.

01:40:39.616 --> 01:40:40.992
Will you please shut up?

01:40:52.004 --> 01:40:53.046
What?

01:40:53.547 --> 01:40:56.299
- It doesn't start.
- Come on, man.

01:40:58.886 --> 01:41:01.137
We are in trouble.

01:41:01.388 --> 01:41:02.555
No!

01:41:09.021 --> 01:41:10.438
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

01:41:13.817 --> 01:41:15.401
That fracture looks bad.

01:41:17.196 --> 01:41:18.946
We ought to drop him off
at the doctor.

01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:23.659
- We're not dropping anybody anywhere.
- My sister Rita done up my arm.

01:41:23.869 --> 01:41:26.829
Really?
I'm a great believer in family.

01:41:27.247 --> 01:41:28.623
Do you have a pen and paper?

01:41:29.416 --> 01:41:32.085
It didn't feel the way I thought,
killing a man.

01:41:32.461 --> 01:41:34.712
- Killing a man?
- It felt terrible.

01:41:35.297 --> 01:41:38.716
- I want you to write something.
- What?

01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:44.097
I want you to give me
custody of Angela.

01:41:44.348 --> 01:41:47.809
- No way.
- You're going to jail for what you did...

01:41:48.018 --> 01:41:51.729
and I will not have that child
placed in a foster home.

01:41:52.481 --> 01:41:54.816
So please. A simple note.

01:41:55.359 --> 01:41:57.944
"I, Darrell Grant..."

01:41:58.195 --> 01:42:00.029
I love that little 'un.

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:03.157
I know you do.
"...give full custody..."

01:42:03.408 --> 01:42:04.992
- You do?
- Yes, I do.

01:42:05.244 --> 01:42:08.454
Let's do this for her.
Let's not put her at risk anymore.

01:42:08.664 --> 01:42:12.125
"...to my wife, Erin Grant."

01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:15.128
Okay.

01:42:16.004 --> 01:42:17.130
Good boy.

01:42:23.345 --> 01:42:25.972
You know, you write quite poorly.

01:42:26.682 --> 01:42:28.891
Are you a high-school graduate?

01:42:34.898 --> 01:42:36.232
Darrell.

01:42:36.483 --> 01:42:37.483
Shit!

01:42:41.488 --> 01:42:44.115
Everybody just stay put, all right?

01:43:08.182 --> 01:43:10.391
This girl is nuts.

01:43:37.085 --> 01:43:38.794
My prostate doctor said...

01:43:39.046 --> 01:43:42.089
that I have to urinate
whenever possible.

01:43:42.507 --> 01:43:45.092
Then go relieve yourself over there.

01:43:45.427 --> 01:43:49.180
Go. Pierre, just stay with him.

01:43:52.976 --> 01:43:53.976
Darrell?

01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:57.104
Darrell? Darrell!

01:44:11.245 --> 01:44:13.663
Now wake up. Come on. Here

01:44:13.997 --> 01:44:15.289
You gotta sign this.

01:44:15.540 --> 01:44:17.875
Sign your name,
that's all you gotta do...

01:44:18.126 --> 01:44:19.543
before you get arrested.

01:44:19.795 --> 01:44:21.921
Now come on. Sign your name.

01:44:25.550 --> 01:44:27.510
There you go.

01:44:28.262 --> 01:44:32.348
"Darrell Grant."
Good boy. Good.

01:44:33.267 --> 01:44:34.642
That's right.

01:44:37.396 --> 01:44:39.313
I'm back!

01:44:40.274 --> 01:44:42.566
No more teasing.

01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:45.695
Finally.

01:44:46.113 --> 01:44:47.196
What?

01:44:47.447 --> 01:44:50.324
Finally you take me like a man.

01:44:50.575 --> 01:44:52.994
Like a congressman.

01:44:53.245 --> 01:44:55.204
I knew you cared for me.

01:44:55.455 --> 01:44:57.748
Malcolm didn't know
what he was talking about.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:01.085
- Now take me.
- Here?

01:45:01.295 --> 01:45:04.297
I've got a special spot
picked out for us.

01:45:04.548 --> 01:45:08.009
Get that music box for me,
will you, honey?

01:45:15.892 --> 01:45:19.478
- Sorry, boss. It all happened...
- Shut up, you nitwit!

01:45:19.730 --> 01:45:23.858
Don't explain. We got a goddamn
stripper about to bring us all down.

01:45:24.568 --> 01:45:26.360
How do I look?

01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:28.279
Not bad.

01:45:30.699 --> 01:45:33.159
- What happened to him?
- I hit him with a rock.

01:45:33.493 --> 01:45:34.952
Who's the man?

01:45:35.203 --> 01:45:36.829
You're the man.

01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:41.500
You are the man and oh, so strong.

01:45:42.252 --> 01:45:45.338
- Well, here we are.
- Here?

01:45:46.381 --> 01:45:48.591
You ever make it
on a pile of sugar before?

01:45:48.842 --> 01:45:50.968
No, but I'm willing to try.

01:45:51.219 --> 01:45:52.678
Well, you're in for a treat.

01:45:52.929 --> 01:45:55.306
You're in for a treat too, darling.

01:45:55.849 --> 01:45:58.100
Now you just let me
put some music on...

01:45:58.352 --> 01:46:01.062
while you take off
those pretty little pants.

01:46:01.313 --> 01:46:03.522
You'd better put on
some blast goggles.

01:46:03.774 --> 01:46:06.400
Because you're in
for an overwhelming sight.

01:46:06.651 --> 01:46:07.902
Shit! Radio for help!

01:46:08.153 --> 01:46:11.864
What do I tell them?
Congressman Dilbeck abducted a woman.

01:46:12.115 --> 01:46:14.241
They'll shut off their radios
and go help him.

01:46:14.493 --> 01:46:16.577
So we're it.
A cop and a bouncer.

01:46:16.828 --> 01:46:19.663
Plus two strippers and a kid.
We're in great shape.

01:46:27.631 --> 01:46:30.633
And two. How come here?
How come not that yacht?

01:46:30.884 --> 01:46:33.719
I'm kind of private.
I don't like people watching.

01:46:33.929 --> 01:46:36.680
Me neither.
I don't like anything kinky.

01:46:36.932 --> 01:46:38.974
I know you don't.
You're a real man.

01:46:39.226 --> 01:46:42.478
I knew it when poor Jerry
was killed and Shad's lawyer.

01:46:42.687 --> 01:46:47.149
I said, "Davey's the real thing.
An M-A-N man."

01:46:47.401 --> 01:46:49.110
A man blackmails you...

01:46:49.361 --> 01:46:50.736
you got to deal with it!

01:46:50.987 --> 01:46:52.696
You got to be hard and firm.

01:46:52.948 --> 01:46:53.948
Whoo! And you can dance.

01:46:54.199 --> 01:46:55.866
- Marry me.
- What?

01:46:56.118 --> 01:46:58.035
Marry me. Just say it.

01:46:58.286 --> 01:46:59.787
- You are married.
- I know.

01:46:59.996 --> 01:47:02.289
But I'd leave my wife in a heartbeat.

01:47:02.541 --> 01:47:05.209
She wouldn't care.
She doesn't like me anyhow.

01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:09.380
Well, this is very sudden,
and I have a lot to think about.

01:47:09.631 --> 01:47:12.591
- I'll make you proud of me.
- I know you would.

01:47:12.843 --> 01:47:16.095
It's like when Jerry said,
"I'm gonna shake down Dilbeck."

01:47:16.346 --> 01:47:17.805
And I said, "Are you crazy?"

01:47:18.056 --> 01:47:21.475
Blackmail a real man like that?"

01:47:21.726 --> 01:47:25.521
I said to Malcolm,
"Just do what you have to do...

01:47:25.772 --> 01:47:28.482
to Jerry, that fat lawyer.
Just do it!"

01:47:28.733 --> 01:47:31.735
- Just do it.
- Just do it! And he did.

01:47:31.987 --> 01:47:33.946
- Didn't he?
- He sure did.

01:47:34.239 --> 01:47:35.448
You idiot!

01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:40.077
- Shit.
- Hi, Malcolm! How you doing?

01:47:40.328 --> 01:47:42.788
I'd like to introduce you
to my fiancÃ©e.

01:47:42.998 --> 01:47:44.373
This is Miss Erin Grant.

01:47:44.624 --> 01:47:46.083
Sorry, Davey.

01:47:46.293 --> 01:47:47.710
You both gotta go.

01:47:47.961 --> 01:47:49.628
Willie's orders.

01:47:50.755 --> 01:47:52.089
You are sick.

01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:55.134
- Murder-suicide, Miss Grant.
- Suicide?

01:47:55.343 --> 01:47:59.013
Hell of a story, isn't it?
A congressman and a stripper.

01:48:01.349 --> 01:48:03.058
Excuse me.
What did you call me?

01:48:03.477 --> 01:48:05.269
A stripper.

01:48:06.188 --> 01:48:07.229
Dancer, asshole.

01:48:08.607 --> 01:48:10.274
George Bush!

01:48:10.692 --> 01:48:14.445
That's not George Bush.
That doesn't look anything like George Bush.

01:48:17.157 --> 01:48:20.117
Drop them. You got till three.

01:48:20.327 --> 01:48:21.327
One.

01:48:23.455 --> 01:48:26.999
- What are you, nuts?
- Yeah, psycho.

01:48:27.250 --> 01:48:31.337
Delusions of invincibility combined
with a strong homicidal urge.

01:48:33.006 --> 01:48:35.925
I have a kick-your-ass fetish.

01:48:36.551 --> 01:48:37.593
Two.

01:48:47.229 --> 01:48:48.270
Boss?

01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:49.480
Three!

01:48:49.731 --> 01:48:53.150
Nico. Goddamn it!

01:48:53.401 --> 01:48:54.777
Good evening, everyone.

01:48:55.278 --> 01:48:56.737
Postman, postman

01:48:56.988 --> 01:48:58.364
Do your duty

01:48:58.615 --> 01:49:01.742
Send this letter
To an American beauty

01:49:01.993 --> 01:49:04.078
You're now under arrest.

01:49:04.287 --> 01:49:06.580
For a variety of charges.

01:49:10.293 --> 01:49:11.835
I need some coffee.

01:49:12.212 --> 01:49:14.797
Why don't we start with homicide.

01:49:19.010 --> 01:49:20.594
You're not arresting anyone.

01:49:24.266 --> 01:49:25.558
Black.

01:49:26.059 --> 01:49:27.059
No sugar.

01:49:44.119 --> 01:49:46.495
I said, no sugar.

01:49:54.129 --> 01:49:57.131
You know you have
a serious dandruff problem.

01:49:57.757 --> 01:49:59.550
Ladies!

01:50:01.511 --> 01:50:03.345
Mama! Mama!

01:50:05.682 --> 01:50:07.266
Baby!

01:50:09.853 --> 01:50:13.022
- You okay, Mama?
- I'm fine, baby.

01:50:16.109 --> 01:50:18.485
See how you could get tendinitis?

01:50:22.032 --> 01:50:24.158
Come on, guys.

01:50:25.577 --> 01:50:27.953
Congressman, you called
a news conference?

01:50:32.375 --> 01:50:34.293
Holy shit!

01:50:38.590 --> 01:50:41.884
Thank you.

01:50:42.385 --> 01:50:46.930
There comes a time in
every public figure's career...

01:50:47.182 --> 01:50:49.642
when he has to think
about his future.

01:50:49.851 --> 01:50:52.519
You are making
a tragic mistake here.

01:51:02.405 --> 01:51:06.742
Jerry, fat lawyer. Just do it! And he did.

01:51:06.993 --> 01:51:08.202
You idiot!

01:51:10.288 --> 01:51:12.539
Do you have any idea
how nuts this was?

01:51:13.249 --> 01:51:14.249
Mama?

01:51:14.918 --> 01:51:16.710
We're going, baby.

01:51:17.796 --> 01:51:19.838
Thank you for all your help.

01:51:20.090 --> 01:51:21.507
Yeah, likewise.

01:51:21.716 --> 01:51:24.051
Keep me posted
on what you decide to do.

01:51:24.302 --> 01:51:28.222
- Maybe I'll run for Congress.
- There's gonna be a seat open now.

01:51:38.024 --> 01:51:40.359
- I'll talk to you soon.
- Yeah. Stay in touch.

01:51:53.289 --> 01:51:54.873
You shouldn't have
done this without me.

01:51:55.542 --> 01:51:57.376
It won't happen again.
