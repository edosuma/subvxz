[girl]<i> Hi. Or should that be:</i>

00:22.560 --> 00:24.280
[in British accent] <i>How do you do?</i>

00:24.360 --> 00:27.200
[chuckles] [in normal voice]<i> I'm Zoe.</i>
<i>I'm 15 and...</i>

00:27.280 --> 00:30.880
<i>Uh, guys? Guys? Wrong girl.</i>

00:33.000 --> 00:35.120
<i>I'm the out-of-place American over here,</i>

00:35.720 --> 00:37.000
<i>and this is England.</i>

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
<i>Beautiful, isn't it?</i>

00:39.760 --> 00:41.120
This place smells of cow.

00:41.560 --> 00:44.920
[Zoe] <i>Yeah, now you come to mention it,</i>
<i>there's a definite aroma.</i>

00:45.280 --> 00:46.920
<i>That's my little sister, Rosie.</i>

00:47.040 --> 00:50.360
<i>She's more LA than a wannabe actor sipping
on kale juice.</i>

00:50.720 --> 00:52.440
We've been walking for days.

00:53.080 --> 00:54.080
Are we lost?

00:54.120 --> 00:57.280
I know these roads
like the back of my hand. I'm not lost.

00:57.760 --> 01:01.560
[Zoe] <i>That's my mom. She's totally lost,</i>
<i>in more ways than one.</i>

01:02.120 --> 01:04.000
- Ooh, look at that.
- [bird squawking]

01:04.080 --> 01:05.320
Is that a buzzard?

01:05.400 --> 01:08.080
[Zoe] <i>And that, my friends,</i>
<i>is a really big horse.</i>

01:08.160 --> 01:09.760
- Excuse me.
- [Rosie gasps]

01:10.680 --> 01:14.120
[Zoe] Sorry. Hope my sister didn't get
in the way of your massive horse.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.560
[Rosie] Oh!

01:15.640 --> 01:17.120
My party shoes.

01:19.040 --> 01:20.160
Did someone say party?

01:21.120 --> 01:22.120
- Gramps!
- [Frank] Zoe!

01:23.200 --> 01:24.640
But how wonderful to see you!

01:26.040 --> 01:28.920
Ah. I thought you were going to camp.
Where's your dad?

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Long story.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.960
Dad, you're not supposed to be driving.

01:33.040 --> 01:35.200
I'm not supposed to be driving a car.

01:35.600 --> 01:37.200
This isn't a car.

01:37.760 --> 01:39.920
- Now, who wants a lift to the house?
- [Rosie] Me.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.480
Get on the back there. Right, that's it.

01:44.440 --> 01:45.440
Welcome home.

01:46.560 --> 01:47.560
Ding, ding!

01:48.240 --> 01:49.600
[Rosie] Hit the gas, Gramps.

01:51.480 --> 01:53.120
[Maggie] Don't encourage him.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.320
Dad, slow down!

[Zoe] <i>Things in LA</i>

- That is very British.

03:20.560 --> 03:21.760
[Zoe chuckles]

03:21.840 --> 03:23.480
So, what happened to Huck?

03:23.560 --> 03:27.280
- Oh, Dad's working.
- Yeah, really hard. [chuckles]

03:27.360 --> 03:31.080
- It's all good, though. I have his ticket.
- You'd really rather spend the summer

03:31.160 --> 03:33.120
with your old grandpa than your friends?

03:33.200 --> 03:35.200
Yeah. They'll be there when I get back.

03:35.760 --> 03:36.600
Probably.

03:36.680 --> 03:39.560
Mmm. Smells good, Gramps.
What are you cooking?

03:39.640 --> 03:43.120
- Rabbit.
- Mom, Grandpa's cooking Peter Rabbit.

03:43.200 --> 03:44.040
[laughs]

03:44.120 --> 03:47.800
- Couldn't you have done egg and chips?
- She should know what real food is.

03:47.880 --> 03:51.360
I suppose it's all rehydrated tofu burgers
in LA.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.200
Are you really going there already?

03:53.280 --> 03:58.400
[Frank] I'm just saying, it'll be good
for them to spend time somewhere real.

03:58.480 --> 04:00.160
Somewhere with a bit of soul.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.240
- [Maggie] LA has soul, too.
- Oh.

04:02.320 --> 04:04.360
[Maggie] If you'd get on a plane,
I could show you.

04:04.440 --> 04:06.480
- [Frank] The last thing I need is LA.
- Perfect.

04:06.560 --> 04:07.560
[Frank] I'm doing fine.

- [Rosie] Mom!

That's it. That's it.
I'm calling the embassy.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.680

- [Maggie] I've looked everywhere.
- She's probably gone... ugh! For a walk.

05:01.120 --> 05:03.696
- Rosie doesn't do walks.
- [Maggie] She doesn't know these roads.

05:03.720 --> 05:08.040
- She doesn't know the dangers.
- We're getting a little hysterical.

05:08.120 --> 05:11.240
- She's only been gone five minutes.
- Grandpa, please, not helping.

Right, yes. My breathing. Uh...

05:19.160 --> 05:20.640
I'll go wait by the phone.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.480
I'll find her. She couldn't have gone far.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.360
- Is your mother always this...
- Recently, yes.

05:26.440 --> 05:29.840
You're not really here to nurse
your invalid grandfather, are you?

05:29.920 --> 05:31.800
- No, Grandpa.
- Thank goodness for that.

Hey, um, I don't suppose you've seen
a ten-year-old girl about yea high,

resembles an angry ball of glitter?

06:07.920 --> 06:10.280
- You're American.
- Oh, no, no, no, I'm French.

06:10.360 --> 06:11.240
Really?

06:11.320 --> 06:12.480
[Zoe] <i>Is she serious?</i>

06:12.560 --> 06:14.400
I've never met a French person before.

Bonjour, stranger.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.000
Okay, so, you haven't seen her?

06:20.080 --> 06:22.800
Just because she's my little sister
and she's on the loose.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.800
No, but we'll keep an eye out.

06:25.320 --> 06:28.360
- Okay, all right. Thank you. Thank you.
- Wait, wait, wait. Um...

06:28.920 --> 06:30.600
What are you... Why... Um...

06:30.680 --> 06:33.440
Translation: Who are you
and what are you doing here?

06:34.000 --> 06:35.240
Oh, well, I'm Zoe.

06:35.320 --> 06:38.280
I'm staying here for the summer
at my gramps' house, over there.

06:38.360 --> 06:41.080
That's right by the stables.
You should totally come and hang out.

06:42.760 --> 06:46.040
You know, I'm not exactly
what you'd call outdoorsy.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.680
It's not all outdoorsy.
Some of it's indoorsy.

06:48.760 --> 06:50.600
Yeah, it's pony camp soon.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.120
Which is gonna be horsesome.

- Got it.

- What?
- I want everyone back in the yard now.

07:04.360 --> 07:07.120
- He's been stolen. He must have been.
- You don't know that.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.800
The security
in this place is utterly inadequate.

07:10.880 --> 07:13.296
- I'm gonna call the police
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

07:13.320 --> 07:16.680
- I'll drive around, see if I can find him.
- [Zoe] <i>Am I in a Jane Austen novel?</i>

<i>- What is this place?</i>
- [Sam] Marcus.

07:25.200 --> 07:28.000
[Zoe] <i>You've got to be kidding me.</i>

07:31.920 --> 07:34.440
<i>No one looks like that in real life.</i>

- Huh?

- Just a horse.

- [Becky] A scary horse.
- I'm really worried, Daddy.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.000
He's totally out of control.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.720
I'm sure your sister will be fine.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.480
- Can I borrow this?
- [Becky] Of course.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.080
Uh, that's my bike.

07:54.720 --> 07:55.720
Be careful.

07:56.440 --> 07:59.360
That girl is the definition of horsesome.

08:00.520 --> 08:03.400
It'll catch on, Jade. Just you wait.

Rough day, huh?

10:13.840 --> 10:15.600
Yeah. Yeah.

I don't think he likes that pointy thing.

- Easy, Miss America. It's just a sedative.
- We just need to get him under control.

Could you help us
get him back to the stables?

Uh, look, I would love to help you
with your scary horse,

I really would,
but I need to find my sister.

11:13.360 --> 11:15.960
Thing is,
it's kind of you or the sedative.

11:16.920 --> 11:19.560
Listen. If you help us out,
we'll help you find your sister.

11:21.560 --> 11:24.760
- Okay, what do you want me to do?
- We need to get this rope clipped on him.

11:24.840 --> 11:26.320

- Whoa, whoa, whoa, shh.

11:26.360 --> 11:27.200
Okay, okay.

11:27.280 --> 11:29.000
Hey. Okay.

11:33.880 --> 11:35.880
[snorting]

11:36.480 --> 11:38.680
Oh, hey, hey. Shh, shh. Come here.

11:41.560 --> 11:44.280
That's great. We need you
to walk him back to the stables,

11:44.360 --> 11:47.800
and we'll be right behind you.
If he does anything, we are right there.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.240
Okay, okay. All right.

11:52.560 --> 11:53.560
Okay.

11:54.920 --> 11:56.280
Shh. It's okay, it's okay.

12:29.240 --> 12:32.160
Couple of horse thefts on the mainland.
It could be related.

12:32.240 --> 12:33.400
[Mia] Horse thieves?

12:33.720 --> 12:35.880
- I knew it.
- He only said it could be.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.400
It must have been a gang.

12:37.480 --> 12:41.760
It'd take at least four men, four big men,
to control that horse. He's utterly wild.

12:42.320 --> 12:43.320
[Mia] Daddy.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.600
[Becky] This is so going on my blog.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.440
Thank you so much, Zoe.
We've got it from here.

13:01.520 --> 13:03.000
[Marcus] Ted, can you give me a hand?

13:03.600 --> 13:04.640
[Ted] Steady, boy.

13:05.240 --> 13:06.240
Steady, boy.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.880
[Sam] Take him to the stables
and get him checked over.

13:09.360 --> 13:11.840
[Zoe] <i>See you soon... I guess.</i>

13:11.920 --> 13:14.880
[Sam] Okay, everyone, show's over.
Let's get back to work.

13:15.640 --> 13:18.160
- It was a false alarm, Officer.
- It's Derek.

13:18.240 --> 13:20.720
- [Sam] I'm so sorry to waste your time.
- No time wasted.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.240
It's always good to see you.
I mean, to see the yard.

13:25.520 --> 13:28.760
Although I'd advise a review
of your alarms and CCTV.

13:28.840 --> 13:29.840
We'll look into it.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.320
Yes, you will.

13:34.160 --> 13:35.440
[sighs]

13:37.320 --> 13:39.000
How's my favorite horse whisperer?

13:39.080 --> 13:41.160
I'm okay. I just need to find my sister.

13:41.240 --> 13:42.240
Right, of course.

13:42.960 --> 13:44.120
Girls.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.360
Wait, wait, wait.

13:46.560 --> 13:47.640
These are Rosie's.

13:47.920 --> 13:50.880
She's not out there. She's in here.
Somewhere.

13:50.960 --> 13:54.560
[Zoe] <i>Seriously, I'm like some kind</i>
<i>of wilderness tracker, right?</i>

13:54.640 --> 13:57.440
We'll help you look.
We know all the best hiding places here.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.920
- Thanks, girls.
- We were playing hide-and-seek once,

14:00.000 --> 14:01.480
and I got stuck in a Portaloo.

14:01.560 --> 14:04.640
- I thought she'd gone home.
- I was in there for six hours.

14:05.360 --> 14:08.400
I got the best photo of you and Raven.
Totally posting it.

14:08.800 --> 14:11.600
"Mysterious Frenchwoman
hypnotizes crazy horse."

14:12.160 --> 14:13.720
I didn't hypnotize him.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.320
[Jade] And she's not French.

14:16.240 --> 14:17.856
- [Becky] It's still huge.
- [Jade] Rosie?

14:17.880 --> 14:20.000
Raven's the wildest horse in the yard.

14:20.280 --> 14:21.320
What's his problem?

14:21.760 --> 14:23.120
No one knows for sure.

14:24.520 --> 14:26.320
He never lets anyone close enough
to find out.

14:26.400 --> 14:27.400
[Jade] Rosie?

14:27.680 --> 14:28.680
Apart from you.

14:29.040 --> 14:30.400
Maybe he's your destiny.

14:30.480 --> 14:32.480
- [Jade] Rosie, are you in here?
- Maybe.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.040
Rosie, are you...?

14:36.560 --> 14:37.560
Oh.

14:37.600 --> 14:38.600
Hey, boy.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.480
This really isn't
a very good hiding place.

14:45.560 --> 14:48.800
- Raven's in here, for starters.
- It's okay. It's okay, it's just me.

14:48.880 --> 14:50.240
We should probably go.

14:50.680 --> 14:52.080
- Careful.
- It's okay.

14:53.200 --> 14:55.360
So, I'm looking for my little sister.

14:55.440 --> 14:57.440
She's a runaway, like you.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.840
Here. See if he wants one of these.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.320
Ah, so, that's how you brought Raven home.

15:08.400 --> 15:11.120
- You bribed him with sweets.
- Told you it'd be something like that.

15:12.480 --> 15:14.000
I mean, it is pretty impressive.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.120
You know, you are the talk of the yard.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.280
- [chuckles] I am?
- I'm Mia.

15:19.560 --> 15:22.440
- I hope these two aren't bothering you.
- No, no, they're cool.

15:22.520 --> 15:24.440
We were helping her look for her sister.

15:24.520 --> 15:28.120
- I suppose you think Raven's eaten her.
- Of course not. [chuckles]

15:28.200 --> 15:29.960
- Have you?
- [Mia] Run along.

15:30.040 --> 15:31.160
I can take things from here.

15:31.240 --> 15:33.160
My dad practically owns the stables.

15:33.240 --> 15:35.760
[Susie] We can show you
how things really work around here.

15:35.840 --> 15:38.480
- Take my number. We should hang out.
- Oh.

15:39.640 --> 15:41.200
Are you two still here?

15:41.920 --> 15:42.920
[Jade] Bye, then.

15:43.680 --> 15:46.360
- I hope you find your sister.
- Wait, wait.

15:47.320 --> 15:49.120
Uh, you know, my phone died.

15:50.960 --> 15:52.600
- Oh.
- Yeah, it does that sometimes.

15:52.680 --> 15:54.840
Especially when people are being mean.

15:59.120 --> 16:01.680
- I don't think I get your meaning.
- No, I think you do.

16:03.600 --> 16:04.600
Suit yourself.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.840
Oh. Uh...

16:07.320 --> 16:10.880
Girls, would you mind staying away
from <i>my </i>horse?

16:10.960 --> 16:13.480
He's had such a crazy day.

16:13.560 --> 16:14.600
Raven is your horse?

16:14.680 --> 16:15.800
That's right, he's mine.

16:16.640 --> 16:17.640
But don't worry,

16:18.000 --> 16:22.680
there are plenty of other horses
in the stables suitable for tourists.

16:25.760 --> 16:27.800
[whinnies]

16:34.120 --> 16:37.280
I can send you that photo,
so you have something to remember him by.

16:37.360 --> 16:38.200
Oh, thank you.

16:38.280 --> 16:41.040
We'll have to go to the haystack.
The Wi-Fi's strongest there.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.200
You guys have Wi-Fi?

16:42.720 --> 16:45.120
[dance music playing on headphones]

16:50.720 --> 16:52.640
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

16:52.720 --> 16:53.560
Hey, sis.

16:53.640 --> 16:57.920
I was just texting Angela and she said
that they're having a really good time.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
We thought a wild horse
had run off with you.

17:00.160 --> 17:02.240
A wild horse? Get a grip, sis.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.080
- You found her, then?
- [Zoe] Yes. Now we're leaving.

17:06.560 --> 17:07.560
Why the rush?

17:07.880 --> 17:10.600
Hi, my name's Rosie,
but you can call me Rosie.

17:11.240 --> 17:12.840
- Or just call me.
- [chuckles]

17:12.920 --> 17:14.920
Ignore her. Home. Now.

17:15.760 --> 17:17.680
- Call me.
- I'll see you around.

17:26.480 --> 17:29.200
Oh, my God.
Hot Marcus totally looked at your face.

17:29.680 --> 17:32.360
Don't most people look at your face
when they're talking to you?

17:32.440 --> 17:34.080
I'd steer clear if I were you.

17:34.160 --> 17:36.560
Mia's basically cocked her leg
and peed on him.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.200
- That's disgusting.
- Excuse me.

17:38.800 --> 17:41.120
What happened to "Home. Now"?

17:41.200 --> 17:42.320
I'm coming.

17:42.400 --> 17:45.200
Thank you guys so much.
I'll see you later.

17:45.280 --> 17:46.280
Wait.

17:46.600 --> 17:48.920
Um, just wondering... Maybe not.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.640
You've probably got way better offers...

17:50.720 --> 17:52.520
- She's asking for your number.
- Oh.

17:53.880 --> 17:55.440
You told Mia your phone was dead.

17:56.400 --> 17:57.440
Give me them digits.

18:02.360 --> 18:04.360
[keys jingling outside]

18:28.840 --> 18:31.880
Make sure you put all the sedatives
back in the medical cabinet.

18:31.960 --> 18:34.560
- Can't afford to buy more right now.
- Yeah, of course.

18:34.640 --> 18:37.960
- Luckily, we didn't have to use any today.
- I know. Thanks to that girl.

18:38.040 --> 18:39.840
- Zoe.
- Right.

18:40.320 --> 18:43.120
- I still can't get over it.
- I know, she was amazing.

18:43.680 --> 18:46.400
I put Raven in the field.
He was going crazy in his stable.

18:46.480 --> 18:49.480
I'll bring him in before it gets dark.
Better safe than sorry at the moment.

18:51.320 --> 18:52.480
[Zoe] <i>Mom was really worried.</i>

18:52.560 --> 18:54.520
[Rosie] Mom gets worried
if I walk under a ladder.

18:54.600 --> 18:58.640
[Zoe] Just because you can't get Wi-Fi,
doesn't mean you can go off and disappear.

18:58.720 --> 19:01.000
You know I feel funny
when I can't get online.

19:01.080 --> 19:02.640
You are not a baby, Ro.

19:03.320 --> 19:04.920
Then stop treating me like one.

19:07.040 --> 19:08.960
Dad chose not to come with us, didn't he?

19:09.720 --> 19:11.600
No, he had work. You know that.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.560
- He's busy.
- Whatever.

19:18.840 --> 19:21.720
As soon as we get to Grandpa's,
I'm Googling the Constitution.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.120
[Zoe] What the...?

19:33.280 --> 19:34.840
- What?
- Nothing.

19:34.920 --> 19:36.920
I'm wondering
why you didn't use the gate.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.400
Spying, are you?

19:38.480 --> 19:40.880
Spying? No, I'm not spying.
I'm just passing.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.960
- I'm staying with my grandpa.
- I know.

19:43.800 --> 19:44.880
Hmm.

19:48.760 --> 19:49.760
Have a look.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.000
- What?
- You obviously think I'm up to something.

19:53.080 --> 19:54.960
So, go on. Have a look.

20:00.840 --> 20:02.640
- No, thanks.
- Suit yourself.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.920
[Zoe] <i>Mysterious bags</i>
<i>and boys coming out of bushes.</i>

20:09.440 --> 20:11.000
<i>Ah, this place has got it all.</i>

20:18.760 --> 20:21.040
Looks like Frank's got guests up
at the house.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.680
- A woman and...
- The girl who brought the dark horse in.

20:24.840 --> 20:26.680
- There's something about her.
- Ah.

20:26.760 --> 20:29.480
- The way she handled Raven, I mean...
- [sighs]

20:29.560 --> 20:30.400
She's different.

20:30.480 --> 20:33.200
A girl like that will break your heart
given half a chance.

20:33.280 --> 20:35.920
- Who said I'd give her a chance?
- I mean it, son.

20:36.440 --> 20:38.840
- Leave well alone.
- What's it to you?

20:38.920 --> 20:40.200
Her family are trouble.

20:42.120 --> 20:43.480
You think everyone's trouble.

20:44.680 --> 20:46.200
Don't say I didn't warn you.

20:51.400 --> 20:54.480
[Maggie] Right, that's one
very grubby daughter in the bath.

20:55.200 --> 20:57.480
- Where exactly did you find her?
- The stables.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.520
- The stables?
- [Zoe] Mm-hmm. Yeah, they had Wi-Fi.

21:00.600 --> 21:03.880
[chuckling] Poor you, having to deal
with a bunch of pony princesses.

21:03.960 --> 21:04.800
No, they weren't...

21:04.880 --> 21:08.200
Tomorrow I'll go into the village
and set Grandpa up with the Internet.

21:08.280 --> 21:13.080
Oh, no. I don't need you coming over here,
bringing all your new-fangled LA ideas.

21:13.160 --> 21:15.880
[laughs] It's not an LA thing.
It's the whole world.

21:16.720 --> 21:19.120
- It's about time you caught up.
- [sighs]

21:19.200 --> 21:21.640
[Rosie] Mom,
where's my strawberry glitter shampoo?

21:26.840 --> 21:28.520
So, you liked the stables, then?

21:28.600 --> 21:30.040
Yeah, yeah, I did.

21:30.120 --> 21:31.960
[Frank] Bright Fields is a good place.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.040
I just hope young Sam can keep it going.

21:34.120 --> 21:36.800
- Mom doesn't seem to think much of it.
- [mutters]

21:36.880 --> 21:38.520
Maggie's always been more of a city girl.

21:38.600 --> 21:39.720
- [alarm ringing]
- Oh.

21:51.040 --> 21:52.520
[phone chimes]

22:08.280 --> 22:09.280
[chuckles]

22:11.800 --> 22:15.040
Now, where were we?

22:15.120 --> 22:16.680
[Maggie] What are you doing up here?

22:17.280 --> 22:21.320
This better be good. I'm about to dive
into a world of knights and ghosts and...

22:23.120 --> 22:24.320
Vampire cats?

22:25.160 --> 22:26.440
<i>Myths and Legends.</i>

22:27.000 --> 22:29.320
I used to love that book
when I was your age.

22:29.400 --> 22:30.400
[sighs]

22:32.400 --> 22:34.320
I wanted to say thank you for today.

22:35.320 --> 22:36.400
You've been a star.

22:37.440 --> 22:40.680
- I'm sorry for being such a...
- Massively overprotective drama queen?

22:40.760 --> 22:42.280
I was gonna go with "concerned mom."

22:42.360 --> 22:43.440
[Zoe chuckles]

22:44.880 --> 22:48.080
Having Rosie to chase round the island
will give you something to do this summer.

22:48.160 --> 22:51.360
Mm, right after I come up with new
and interesting ways to lie about Dad.

22:53.160 --> 22:54.800
- I'm sorry, Mom...
- It's okay.

22:55.760 --> 22:58.440
Your dad and I just need a bit
of time apart to figure out...

22:59.040 --> 23:00.160
where we're going wrong.

23:01.640 --> 23:03.280
Yeah. Yeah.

23:04.240 --> 23:05.240
Enjoy the book.

23:05.640 --> 23:06.640
Thank you.

23:10.280 --> 23:14.520
[Zoe] <i>And now, finally,</i>
<i>the total peace and quiet can begin.</i>

Hey.

Hey, boy. Hey.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.600
I just wanted to come
and say good night.

There's nothing to be scared of.

24:16.440 --> 24:17.440
