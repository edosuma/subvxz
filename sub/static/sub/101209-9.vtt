[Allison cries out]

00:22.105 --> 00:23.732
Vanya's in the room
at the end of the hall.

00:23.815 --> 00:26.526
-How do you propose we get to her?
-I haven't figured that one out yet.

00:26.609 --> 00:28.403
-You can count me out.
-Klaus!

00:28.486 --> 00:31.448
What? You guys should save her.
You're great at all the hero shit.

00:31.531 --> 00:34.659
-[Allison] Oh, Klaus!
-Listen, listen. Vanya would understand

00:34.743 --> 00:37.829
'cause she has realistic expectations
of what I am.

00:37.912 --> 00:40.498
And what I am is sexy trash.

00:40.582 --> 00:43.626
-You're a big pussy, that's what you are.
-Guys, now is not the time.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.920
Why? Because I don't wanna die? Who does?

00:46.296 --> 00:49.299
And martyrs aren't around
to enjoy the victory party

00:49.382 --> 00:50.508
'cause they're dead!

00:50.592 --> 00:52.635
-You are going out there...
-I'm not! Go away!

00:52.719 --> 00:53.762
...or I'm gonna beat you,

00:53.845 --> 00:55.555
-and not the way you like it!
-That's my cue.

00:55.638 --> 00:57.348

All right. I'm going.

01:25.376 --> 01:26.878
-No, wait, wait, wait, wait.
-What?

01:26.961 --> 01:30.673
If you don't make it back,
there's one thing that I need to tell you.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.258
-I don't have time for this.
-Please.

01:32.342 --> 01:33.343
What?

01:33.843 --> 01:38.056
[voice trembles] You look like
Antonio Banderas with the long hair.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.391
I just thought you should know.

01:42.018 --> 01:43.103

[Diego] Klaus!

02:18.179 --> 02:19.556
I'm not gonna make it!

02:20.223 --> 02:21.724
It's up to you, buddy!

02:21.808 --> 02:23.309
You gotta save the world!

02:23.393 --> 02:27.188
-No, Diego, that's a terrible idea!

[grunts, shouts]

02:39.117 --> 02:41.619
[panting] Okay, Klaus.

02:42.078 --> 02:43.288
You can do this.

02:43.371 --> 02:45.123
You fought in Vietnam.

02:45.665 --> 02:48.293
You survived a family of seven.

02:49.043 --> 02:53.548
And you once wore a sarong
to a fraternity party

02:53.631 --> 02:55.717
and got a shitload of numbers.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.315
All right, just be cool

04:34.399 --> 04:36.526
till I finish the job on the grassy knoll.

04:37.026 --> 04:39.279
We'll get the time math
and I'll ice the squirt.

04:39.487 --> 04:42.031
I just wish there was another way,
you know?

04:42.115 --> 04:44.909
-There isn't. Look at him.
-[teen Five] What are you looking at?

04:44.993 --> 04:46.911
-Look.
-[teen Five] See something funny?

04:46.995 --> 04:49.414
Worst case of paradox psychosis
I ever seen.

04:50.915 --> 04:52.083
Eh-- What's wrong?

04:52.583 --> 04:55.753
-Well, I... feel bad for him. You know?
-[teen Five] Mind your business!

04:55.837 --> 04:58.214
-Or I'll give you something to stare at.
-He's just a little guy.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.549
Everybody's a little guy to you.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.884
-You wish you could pull off these shorts!
-You look like King Kong

05:01.968 --> 05:03.594
and the Hitler Youth had a baby.

05:04.762 --> 05:07.932
Luther, I... I don't have time for you
to tuck and squeeze here.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.476
Can I count on you
to keep him under control?

05:12.270 --> 05:15.106
-Yeah, I'll do my best, yeah.
-All right.

05:18.109 --> 05:21.237
[upbeat chuckle]
Hey, brother. How you doing?

05:22.739 --> 05:25.616
-He's gonna kill me, isn't he?
-[scoffing laugh] What?

05:26.701 --> 05:27.660
What, him?

05:28.161 --> 05:29.120
He's gonna kill you?

05:29.203 --> 05:31.247
[laughs softly]
Yeah, right. That's ridiculous.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.083
You know, you're a terrible liar, Luther.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.002
You're a worse liar
than you are a spotter.

05:36.085 --> 05:37.420
Okay, whose fault is that?

05:37.503 --> 05:39.881
What good is having a spotter
if you won't even listen to him?

05:39.964 --> 05:41.632
So you admit
you're conspiring against me?

05:41.716 --> 05:44.594
Do... Do you admit that you're suffering
from paradox psychosis?

05:44.677 --> 05:48.806
All I'm suffering from is bracing clarity
about you and your murderous intentions.

05:48.890 --> 05:51.184
Look, it's not like he's gonna
"kill you" kill you.

05:51.267 --> 05:52.977
He just wants to kill a, um...

05:53.353 --> 05:56.564
-version of you.
-But I am that version of me.

05:56.647 --> 05:59.817
Hey, I don't love it, either,
but he's actually got a pretty good plan.

06:00.777 --> 06:04.739
What? The one where you guys off me
and then jump to 2019 to save the world?

06:05.698 --> 06:07.450
Yeah, wait, how did you know that?

06:07.533 --> 06:10.411
Because I'm him,
and that is exactly what I would do

06:10.495 --> 06:12.413
-if I were trying to kill me!
-Okay, all I know is

06:12.497 --> 06:13.581
we've got one Five too many,

06:13.664 --> 06:16.417
-and you're the one acting like a maniac.
-Maniac?

06:16.501 --> 06:18.127
Luther, you have seen nothing.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.963
If you want a maniac,
I will show you maniac.

06:22.423 --> 06:23.633
Okay, as your spotter,

06:23.716 --> 06:25.593
I think the best thing
I can do for you right now

06:25.676 --> 06:26.886
is put you out of your misery.

06:26.969 --> 06:28.304
Okay, Luther, listen.

06:29.013 --> 06:32.350
I know your feeble mind only responds
to age and authority,

06:32.433 --> 06:34.227
so listen very closely.

06:34.852 --> 06:37.855
Yet again,
you are experiencing daddy issues,

06:38.856 --> 06:42.485
this time with your own brother,
which honestly is making me a bit crazy.

06:42.777 --> 06:43.736
But remember this:

06:43.820 --> 06:46.072
I'm 14 days older than him.

06:46.781 --> 06:48.658
I have seniority here.

06:48.741 --> 06:51.202
So it is me you should be listening to,
Luther.

06:51.285 --> 06:52.995
[loudly] I'm the daddy here!

06:53.079 --> 06:55.081
-[pedestrians whispering]
-[Luther chuckles]

06:55.331 --> 06:56.958
How's it going? [forced laugh]

06:57.375 --> 06:59.836
[softly]
Five, please, you're being unseemly.

06:59.961 --> 07:00.795
Look at you.

07:01.796 --> 07:05.216
I admit there is a possibility
that I may not be in my fully...

07:06.217 --> 07:08.052
-right mind right now.
-Okay, good.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.431
-But whatever I've got, he's got it too.
-What?

07:11.681 --> 07:13.850
[adult Five]
You two quit grab-assing. We're here.

07:13.933 --> 07:16.310
[people chattering nearby]

07:21.274 --> 07:23.276
[adult Five farting]

07:23.359 --> 07:25.611
[softly] Flatulence. Stage four.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.947
See? What's your plan now, bucko?

07:28.030 --> 07:30.783
[farting]

07:31.409 --> 07:33.411
That was just lunch, all right? Shut up.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.341
[Handler] Careful.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.595
I want that hem straight enough
to cut throats.

07:51.053 --> 07:51.888
[door opens]

07:53.473 --> 07:54.599
[Handler] Hmm.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.687
-Nice frock.
-[Handler chuckles]

07:59.770 --> 08:02.732
Is this a swearing in
or a... a coronation?

08:02.815 --> 08:04.233
How's your new hire working out?

08:04.901 --> 08:07.445
I heard he lasted all of ten minutes
in orientation

08:07.528 --> 08:09.155
before he started running amok.

08:09.238 --> 08:10.198
Oh, you know boys.

08:10.281 --> 08:13.534
He's probably around here somewhere
eating a... a very large sandwich.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.244
Mm-hmm. Herb!

08:15.328 --> 08:17.371
-[office phone ringing nearby]
-[door opens]

08:19.207 --> 08:21.083
[Handler] Tell Lila what you told me.

08:22.543 --> 08:25.129
-I, uh, didn't actually offer it up.
-[door closes]

08:25.213 --> 08:27.340
[breath trembling]
You put a knife to my throat.

08:27.423 --> 08:28.257
Go on.

08:29.842 --> 08:31.719
Diego commandeered
the Infinite Switchboard,

08:32.053 --> 08:33.554
then hijacked a briefcase...

08:34.764 --> 08:36.140
and left the Commission.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.225
Told you.

08:37.308 --> 08:39.477
[Herb] He also held a knife to my throat.

08:41.062 --> 08:43.397
[Handler]
I knew he was a grifting little gonad.

08:43.773 --> 08:46.275
So, what are you gonna do about him?

08:46.692 --> 08:48.110
-[Handler giggles]
-Me?

08:49.028 --> 08:50.696
Your puppy, your responsibility.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.282
Or are you forgetting
our little agreement?

08:54.325 --> 08:56.410
You only let him stay
hoping I'd have to kill him.

08:56.953 --> 08:57.787
[Handler] Hmm.

08:58.287 --> 08:59.330
Was this all a test?

08:59.413 --> 09:01.666
Everything is a test, darling.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.335
The question is... [pours drink]

09:04.418 --> 09:08.381
-...why are you failing it?
-[AJ clinks glass softly]

09:08.798 --> 09:09.757
[Lila] I'm not failing.

09:10.132 --> 09:11.300
Let me handle it my way.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.135
Does your way include decapitation?

09:13.511 --> 09:14.845
Quartering, boiling,

09:14.929 --> 09:18.558
thumbscrews, burning at the stake,
or Chinese water torture?

09:19.141 --> 09:20.309
I wanna let him go.

09:22.019 --> 09:22.979
Peons...

09:24.230 --> 09:25.064
out.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.794
Darling, blood is thicker than water,
but...

09:47.837 --> 09:49.880
you can drown in either, Lila.

09:50.339 --> 09:53.009
I am officially about to become

09:53.092 --> 09:55.720
the most powerful woman in time,

09:56.762 --> 09:58.806
and you will be my right hand.

10:00.057 --> 10:02.268
-But I need to know...
-[grunts softly]

10:02.351 --> 10:03.811
...that I can trust you...

10:04.854 --> 10:05.980
at all times...

10:07.523 --> 10:08.524
in all ways.

10:12.069 --> 10:13.154
[softly] You can.

743.

10:34.342 --> 10:35.217
Okay.

10:39.430 --> 10:40.514
Oh.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.246
What's wrong, baby?

11:45.329 --> 11:46.914
How do I help you? [gasps]

11:46.997 --> 11:49.250
-Please, I don't know what to do.
-[Carl] Jesus.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.335
-What the hell happened?
-No, I just found him this way.

11:51.794 --> 11:52.712
Vanya.

-Vanya?

Oh, my God.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.928
Oh, Harlan.

12:01.011 --> 12:03.055
What the hell did she do to our boy?

12:03.139 --> 12:04.932
[Sissy] Carl! Carl, what are you doing?

12:05.015 --> 12:07.184
[Carl] Something I should've done
a long time ago!

12:07.268 --> 12:09.019
-Carl, no!
-Time to get him the help he needs!

12:09.103 --> 12:09.979
-Carl!
-[door opens]

12:10.062 --> 12:12.940
No, he doesn't belong
in one of those places!

12:13.524 --> 12:14.734
Hold on, Harlan.

12:15.401 --> 12:16.861
Gonna get you some help.

12:16.944 --> 12:18.738
No matter what your mama says.

[Sissy] Get out of the car.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.475
[Carl] Sissy, don't be a fool.

It was a typo.

31:18.251 --> 31:19.085
Typo?

We put the decimal in the wrong spot

of a bound for the number of limit cycles
