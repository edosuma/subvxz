00:08.258 --> 00:10.760
<i>Previously on </i>Riverdale:
-We will not rest

00:10.844 --> 00:15.098
until those responsible for the murder
of our sister is rightly punished.

00:15.181 --> 00:16.016
Fangs.

00:16.599 --> 00:19.602
Mrs. Klump. The Sheriff Department
is working around the clock.

00:20.186 --> 00:22.647
You were supposed to be protecting
our children.

00:22.939 --> 00:24.315
-Ransom money.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.109
Not for Archie. I got him back.

00:26.192 --> 00:29.946
This is from when I turned the tables
on Nick and held him for ransom instead.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.614
I haven't made my bones with you.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.409
Only one man I'm interested
in bringing down.

00:34.492 --> 00:37.162
-Black Hood.
-Whatever I can do to help you

00:37.245 --> 00:38.455
you can count on me.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.540
<i>The Black Hood speaking.</i>

00:40.623 --> 00:44.169
And I got a letter.
These symbols look so familiar to me.

00:44.377 --> 00:46.129
I used to check out this book.

00:46.212 --> 00:48.339
How could the Black Hood
know that?

00:48.423 --> 00:49.340
<i>Put it on.</i>

00:50.008 --> 00:53.511
-<i>To show you we're the same.</i>

00:53.595 --> 00:56.347
Where is he, Betty?
Where did you take Chic?

00:56.431 --> 00:59.684
-I didn't mean to hurt him.

01:00.143 --> 01:02.062
I'm gonna give you a head start.

01:05.732 --> 01:07.150
Mom, where's Dad?

01:15.575 --> 01:16.868
-Hello.
-Hello, sir.

01:16.951 --> 01:21.081
I'm campaigning for my dad. He's running
for mayor and could use your vote.

01:21.164 --> 01:25.502
<i>On the eve of the debate,</i>
<i>as Archie Andrews goes door-to-door...</i>

01:27.045 --> 01:30.715
<i>he doesn't mention the murder</i>
<i>of his classmate Midge Klump.</i>

01:31.257 --> 01:34.260
Excuse me.
I'm campaigning for my dad, Fred Andrews.

01:34.344 --> 01:37.639
-I'm voting for Hiram Lodge.

01:39.057 --> 01:41.309
Take the flyer, sir,
in case you change your mind.

01:41.392 --> 01:42.310
Sure.

01:42.393 --> 01:45.063
<i>Most believed Midge was murdered</i>
<i>by someone else.</i>

01:46.898 --> 01:50.401
<i>But not Archie. He was certain,</i>
<i>beyond a shadow of a doubt,</i>

01:50.485 --> 01:51.903
<i>the Black Hood was back.</i>

01:52.529 --> 01:55.031
<i>As was his next-door neighbor</i>
<i>Betty Cooper.</i>

01:55.115 --> 01:58.034
<i>Who had, in fact,</i>
<i>laid eyes on the Black Hood,</i>

01:58.118 --> 02:00.537
<i>and suspected he was much closer.</i>

02:01.996 --> 02:03.873
Penny for your thoughts, hon?

02:05.959 --> 02:08.628
I was thinking that he was a test.

02:10.755 --> 02:13.508
-The imposter. Chic.

02:13.591 --> 02:19.597
Everything that he did to us
and brought to us was kind of a test.

02:20.181 --> 02:24.602
-We survived and we're stronger for it.
-Well, that remains to be seen.

02:24.686 --> 02:29.399
No, Mom, we are.
We'll survive whatever comes next.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.322
<i>Can't see my bruises anymore.</i>

02:36.406 --> 02:39.826
Yes, no reason whatsoever
to bring up Nick's failed attempt

02:39.909 --> 02:41.786
to kidnap and murder you.

02:42.078 --> 02:43.079
Speaking of.

02:43.163 --> 02:46.332
-There's one thing I wanted to tell you.

02:46.416 --> 02:49.419
Word of my exploits
serving Nick his comeuppance

02:49.502 --> 02:52.922
has seeped into the demimonde
of mobsters and molls

02:53.006 --> 02:55.091
my father used to associate with.

02:55.174 --> 02:58.845
So, the five families
are sending their youngest and brightest,

02:58.928 --> 03:03.892
their princes, as it were, to, well,
come court the rare Mafia princess

03:03.975 --> 03:06.019
who can belly up to the bar
with the big boys.

03:06.102 --> 03:07.186
What do you mean court?

03:07.270 --> 03:09.898
Thanks to my play,
the families are looking

03:09.981 --> 03:13.484
to make business and/or political
alliances with my parents.

03:13.568 --> 03:15.737
It's all very Borgia-Medici.

03:15.820 --> 03:17.822
Archie. If you have a moment?

03:18.114 --> 03:21.784
Go ahead. We'll meet up at lunch.
After I welcome the tributes.

03:23.661 --> 03:26.873
My spies tell me
you're campaigning for your father.

03:26.956 --> 03:30.919
I'm not campaigning, Mr. Lodge.
I'm trying to find the Black Hood.

03:31.461 --> 03:34.672
It sounds insane, but I remember his eyes.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.966
So, I'm going house-to-house to...

03:37.800 --> 03:42.388
Stare into men's eyes? That sounds
like looking for a needle in a haystack.

03:42.472 --> 03:45.099
But we don't even know
if that needle is in the haystack.

03:45.183 --> 03:48.144
You wanted to make your bones.
Is that still true?

03:50.355 --> 03:51.689
-Yes.
-Then...

03:53.942 --> 03:58.446
reform your Dark Circle. You'll want
backup should you identify Black Hood.

03:58.529 --> 04:01.491
Reggie and the guys are fired up,
for sure,

04:01.574 --> 04:04.827
but I need focused lasers,
not loose cannons.

04:05.453 --> 04:09.791
To help with that, a new sheriff's
taken over for Keller. Michael Minetta.

04:09.874 --> 04:12.919
A man I know well.
You could coordinate with him.

04:13.002 --> 04:14.170
-Yes.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.090
I'll arrange a meeting,
but move fast, Archie.

04:17.507 --> 04:21.511
Every hour that passes, our killer
could be planning his next attack.

04:23.888 --> 04:25.139
Any word from Chic?

04:26.557 --> 04:31.104
No. He hasn't called since I took him
to the bus station, so, who knows?

04:31.187 --> 04:32.730
Maybe he's gone for good.

04:35.817 --> 04:39.445
Silver lining to all this Chic stuff
over the last weeks is...

04:39.821 --> 04:43.658
that's as bad as it gets, Betty.
It can't get worse. How could it?

04:44.492 --> 04:46.202
My dad could be the Black Hood.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.579
Yeah. Okay, well...

04:49.497 --> 04:51.082
that would be worse.

04:55.336 --> 05:00.925
Well, well, well. Aren't you boys
a handsome assortment of he

05:01.259 --> 05:04.470
Veronica, these young men have come
to pay their respects.

05:04.554 --> 05:06.097
I know why they're here.

05:06.180 --> 05:09.225
While I'm dying to hear your proposals,
I'm late.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.436
Maybe I can squeeze you in tomorrow?

05:11.519 --> 05:12.437
Uh...

05:13.229 --> 05:15.565
-You do things your way, Mom,

05:15.648 --> 05:16.774
I do things mine.

05:19.402 --> 05:21.237
<i>There's no one else I can talk to.</i>

05:21.321 --> 05:23.823
No one else who might understand
what I'm going through.

05:24.782 --> 05:27.285
Dear cousin, you look harrowed.
What is it?

05:27.744 --> 05:30.455
Cheryl,
before you saw the video of your dad...

05:31.205 --> 05:32.665
shooting Jason...

05:33.499 --> 05:36.127
did you know that he was the murderer?

05:36.461 --> 05:37.754
Subconsciously, yes.

05:38.254 --> 05:39.172
Why do you ask?

05:41.049 --> 05:43.843
I think there's a chance that my dad...

05:45.344 --> 05:46.471
That somehow...

05:49.766 --> 05:51.392
he might be the Black Hood.

05:53.519 --> 05:54.395
Oh.

05:54.979 --> 05:57.273
Oh, Betty, I don't know.

05:57.857 --> 06:00.568
I've seen your pater
sneak around Thistlehouse,

06:00.651 --> 06:03.446
and he has all the stealth
of a Marshmallow Man.

06:03.529 --> 06:06.240
-Intuition.

06:06.324 --> 06:08.701
I don't want my dad to be a murderer.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.329
It would destroy our lives even more,
but...

06:12.663 --> 06:15.792
I don't know. I can feel it in my bones.

06:17.919 --> 06:20.421
If you're coming to me for advice, fine.

06:20.630 --> 06:23.674
Let's get you to the po-po.
Maybe this new sheriff has half a brain.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.551
No. No. Not yet.

06:25.676 --> 06:28.387
I need to be sure
before I involve anyone else.

06:28.971 --> 06:32.100
It's hard to explain,
but if my dad is the Black Hood,

06:32.183 --> 06:35.645
I need to be the one who confronts him,
who stops him.

06:37.105 --> 06:40.566
In that case,
absorb my hard-learned advice.

06:40.858 --> 06:43.277
You need concrete proof or a confession
or both.

06:43.402 --> 06:45.780
Buy yourself time while you investigate.

06:45.863 --> 06:49.784
-Means pretending everything is normal.
-Well, that's my specialty.

06:50.535 --> 06:53.579
You're playing a very dangerous game,
Betty Cooper.

06:57.291 --> 07:00.044
I don't think he would hurt
his own daughter.

07:01.879 --> 07:04.549
I never thought my dad
would shoot his son.

07:05.341 --> 07:07.260
But that's the world we live in.

07:08.594 --> 07:10.138
Tread carefully, cousin.

07:17.937 --> 07:21.315
You and Fred are neck and neck,
and with the town divided over our prison,

07:21.399 --> 07:24.026
-this debate--
-Is the most important event

07:24.110 --> 07:25.528
of the election, I know.

07:25.611 --> 07:28.281
-I know, <i>basta.</i>
-We already control the Sheriff's Office,

07:28.364 --> 07:30.908
and the <i>Register,</i>
but we need the mayor's office as well.

07:30.992 --> 07:32.410
So the prison can't be blocked.

07:32.493 --> 07:34.745
I'm hoping Archie's Dark Circle
will cause unrest.

07:34.829 --> 07:36.998
If Fred can't control his own son,

07:37.081 --> 07:41.544
he certainly can't control a town
on the verge of sliding into chaos.

07:43.171 --> 07:47.550
If what happened to Midge taught us
anything, it's no one is safe, anywhere.

07:47.633 --> 07:50.052
The town needs us, needs Dark Circle.

07:50.136 --> 07:53.598
And this time, we'll have the new
sheriff's support. No offense, Kev.

07:53.681 --> 07:55.391
None taken. I'm here to catch the guy

07:55.475 --> 07:58.311
-who cost my dad his job.
-Guys, I gotta tell you something.

07:58.728 --> 08:01.481
The night of the show, Midge and I
got into a fight backstage

08:01.564 --> 08:04.775
because she admitted... she was seeing
someone else behind my back.

08:06.819 --> 08:09.197
-She let it slip it was a Serpent.

08:11.699 --> 08:15.286
I knew it. I knew it the second
they set foot in this school.

08:15.369 --> 08:17.788
Moose, why didn't you say anything to us?

08:17.872 --> 08:19.457
-I didn't wanna look

08:19.540 --> 08:21.626
like the jealous boyfriend,
have people think--

08:23.419 --> 08:25.338
-We talk to the new sheriff.
Screw that.

08:25.421 --> 08:30.051
Some Serpent scumbag was doing Midge.
We just gotta figure out which one.

08:30.468 --> 08:33.012
<i>War Baby called my father and I</i>
<i>from Shankshaw.</i>

08:33.095 --> 08:35.806
Our adversaries, the Ghoulies,
have been released.

08:35.890 --> 08:39.727
They want Serpent blood.
They're gunning for a rematch.

08:39.810 --> 08:40.853
They want war.

08:44.899 --> 08:48.611
-This is a private meeting.
-I'm guessing it was you, Sweet Pea.

08:49.445 --> 08:52.532
-Reggie, that's enough.
-Ass. I didn't even know Midge.

08:52.615 --> 08:56.035
I get why she wouldn't want fleas
from you mangy Bulldogs.

08:56.118 --> 08:57.286
-Reggie, no!
-Hey!

08:57.370 --> 09:00.331
-Serpents, back off! Now!
-Dark Circle, stand down!

09:13.678 --> 09:15.179
So, I've been thinking...

09:15.930 --> 09:19.308
Dad, you've been so busy
at the <i>Register </i>lately,

09:19.392 --> 09:20.935
maybe Mom should go back to work.

09:21.018 --> 09:25.231
I mean, she's moderating the debate,
why not report on it, as well?

09:26.816 --> 09:30.695
-That's not a terrible idea.
-And I could help, too, after school.

09:30.778 --> 09:34.949
-With proofing and layout.


09:36.909 --> 09:38.077
<i>It's bad, Jones.</i>

09:38.160 --> 09:39.787
It's really bad.

09:39.870 --> 09:42.540
-Talk to me.
-On the opening night of <i>Carrie,</i>

09:42.623 --> 09:44.792
when you were backstage
filming your documentary

09:44.875 --> 09:47.128
and you found me
in Midge's dressing room...

09:47.920 --> 09:49.880
I wasn't just giving her notes.

09:50.464 --> 09:51.674
You were hooking up?

09:53.009 --> 09:55.094
And you didn't tell Sheriff Keller?

09:56.137 --> 10:00.474
-I know. I know.

10:03.477 --> 10:04.312
Did you do it?

10:05.271 --> 10:08.941
Of course not.
You've gotta believe me, Jones.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.736
-I do.
-Delete the footage off your camera.

10:11.819 --> 10:14.322
I already gave the footage over to Keller
as evidence.

10:14.405 --> 10:16.198
-Nothing.

10:16.907 --> 10:18.951
Lay low. Serpents got your back.

10:20.244 --> 10:21.203
I got your back.

10:29.962 --> 10:30.796
Okay.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.258
Canned meat isn't exactly sexy,
but it's making a comeback.

10:34.342 --> 10:38.012
Tell your folks we should open a cannery
in that maple syrup factory.

10:38.095 --> 10:40.514
I like my meat free-range and grass-fed.

10:41.098 --> 10:43.351
My family runs a 5000-seat arena
in Pacific City.

10:43.434 --> 10:46.145
They're looking to do the same here.
Have a favorite boxer?

10:46.228 --> 10:48.314
Michelle Rodriguez in <i>Girlfight.</i>

10:49.273 --> 10:53.110
My family owns a track. If you get
your old man to invest with my old man,

10:53.194 --> 10:57.323
-I'll name a horse after you.
-I want ships named after me, not horses.

10:59.617 --> 11:02.495
We own the largest chain of casinos
in the region, Miss Lodge.

11:02.578 --> 11:05.748
-And we're looking to expand.
-I'm not opposed to games of luck, Elio,

11:05.831 --> 11:08.959
-No. No need to be crooked.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.586
Or haven't you heard?

11:10.878 --> 11:12.213
The house always wins.

11:13.130 --> 11:14.715
Tell me more, Elio.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.593
Oh, and it's Veronica, not Miss Lodge.

11:30.439 --> 11:32.942
That's pretty forceful branding,
Archie.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.527
Reggie made those, not me.

11:34.610 --> 11:37.321
I need your Dark Circle
to lay off my Serpents.

11:37.863 --> 11:41.283
-Though they were right about something.

11:42.034 --> 11:45.121
One of my Serpents was canoodling
with Midge, but he didn't kill her.

11:45.204 --> 11:47.456
And I'm not gonna give you his name,
so don't ask,

11:47.540 --> 11:51.001
but rest assured, none of my crew is
a middle-aged white guy with green eyes.

11:51.085 --> 11:53.629
-And that's who you're looking for.
-Yeah.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.924
-I'll tell Reggie to lay off.
-Thank you.

11:58.426 --> 12:01.637
In the meantime, I need to get back
some possibly incriminating footage

12:01.720 --> 12:02.721
from this new sheriff.

12:08.644 --> 12:09.478
<i>Gentlemen.</i>

12:11.397 --> 12:13.691
The man I was telling you about.
Archie Andrews

12:13.774 --> 12:15.651
The one organizing the safety initiative.

12:15.818 --> 12:18.237
The Dark Circle.
A man after my own heart.

12:19.363 --> 12:21.615
And this is the other one.

12:22.908 --> 12:23.993
The muckraker.

12:24.743 --> 12:25.786
The troublemaker.

12:25.870 --> 12:26.704
Hmm.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.539
You forgot iconoclast.

12:29.206 --> 12:32.334
I was wondering if I could have a word
about some documentary footage.

12:32.543 --> 12:34.462
That I lent to your predecessor?

12:34.920 --> 12:37.089
Sure. Let's chat in my office.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.597
Mm. Archie, Archie, Archie.

12:47.057 --> 12:50.269
You said you wanted to introduce me
to Sheriff Minetta.

12:50.478 --> 12:53.022
So, I took it upon myself to stop by.

12:53.981 --> 12:56.317
Well, since you have so much free time,

12:56.609 --> 12:59.195
Veronica may have mentioned
she's entertaining a young man

12:59.278 --> 13:02.531
from a prominent family tonight.
I'm hoping you'll accompany them.

13:03.157 --> 13:04.783
Absolutely, Mr. Lodge.

13:10.831 --> 13:15.085
Out of all the offers on the
table, Elio, yours inspired me the most.

13:15.169 --> 13:19.882
So, what if our families were to partner
up for, say, The Sweetwater Casino?

13:19.965 --> 13:22.176
Nothing would make my father happier.

13:22.510 --> 13:23.344
Perfection.

13:28.015 --> 13:31.352
Now, play nice, boys,
while I go powder my nose.

13:40.444 --> 13:42.404
How'd you get in with the Lodges?

13:44.532 --> 13:48.494
-I'm mostly just with Veronica.
-My dad says you're one of Hiram's capos.

13:48.577 --> 13:50.996
You made your bones
taking care of Papa Poutine?

13:51.080 --> 13:51.914
No.

13:52.540 --> 13:53.457
That wasn't me.

13:53.541 --> 13:56.418
Word is Papa Poutine's son Small Fry
is looking for payback.

13:56.502 --> 13:59.421
No one in Riverdale had anything to do
with that.

14:05.553 --> 14:08.097
Sure you don't wanna take a break
and join us for dinner?

14:08.180 --> 14:09.348
I'm not hungry right now.

14:09.431 --> 14:11.809
Get me a tomato bisque for later?

14:12.560 --> 14:14.812
And maybe an Orange Freeze?

14:15.479 --> 14:16.564
Sounds great, Dad.

14:43.549 --> 14:46.135
I got into my dad's planner
and cross-referenced the dates

14:46.218 --> 14:49.430
of every Black Hood attack
with his schedule, and they all line up.

14:49.513 --> 14:53.225
Okay. Worked late the night
Midge and Moose were attacked.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.269
Early meeting the morning Fred was shot.

14:55.853 --> 14:58.230
Business trip
the night Miss Grundy was killed.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.024
Business trip to Greendale.

15:00.107 --> 15:02.151
This isn't proof,
but this is corroboration.

15:09.825 --> 15:10.701
<i>Register.</i>

15:10.784 --> 15:14.204
<i>Mrs. Cooper, this is Dr. Curdle</i>
<i>from the coroner's office.</i>

15:14.663 --> 15:15.497
How...?

15:17.249 --> 15:18.500
How can I help you?

15:18.584 --> 15:20.753
<i>I have a warm corpse for you.</i> <i>Unidentified male, mid-20s.</i>

15:23.213 --> 15:27.176
<i>His body turned up off the highway,</i>
<i>just outside of town. Mutilated.</i>

15:30.095 --> 15:31.013
<i>Mrs. Cooper?</i>

15:31.388 --> 15:32.222
<i>Are you there?</i> Yes.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.977
I'll come by to see it.
Thank you, Dr. Curdle.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.147
<i>As always, small bills are preferable.</i>

15:44.193 --> 15:47.821
-We have to go to the morgue.
Another Black Hood victim?

15:48.656 --> 15:50.616
I sent the Black Hood after Chic.

15:51.659 --> 15:54.286
I gave Chic a head start
and told him to run,

15:54.370 --> 15:56.163
but maybe he didn't make it.

16:02.461 --> 16:06.799
Sheriff wouldn't give me back my footage.
He wants to go through it frame by frame.

16:06.882 --> 16:10.511
Only a matter of time before he puts
two and two together and brings Fangs in.

16:10.594 --> 16:13.514
Damn it.
Of all the girls in Riverdale High.

16:14.932 --> 16:15.766
What do I do?

16:16.141 --> 16:18.686
If Fangs runs, he looks guilty.

16:18.769 --> 16:21.814
If he gets caught withholding the truth,
he'll look like the killer.

16:24.942 --> 16:28.404
It's a perfect storm.
The Lodges endorsed this new sheriff.

16:28.487 --> 16:29.989
They want Midge's killer caught.

16:30.072 --> 16:33.409
-If it's a Southsider, much better.
-Then we hunker down.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.246
Get ready to fight.

16:48.173 --> 16:49.008
Dad?

16:54.179 --> 16:55.848
What are you still doing up?

16:56.849 --> 16:59.685
I got this note. Pinned to the door.

17:00.728 --> 17:03.939
I can only assume it's our old pal,
the Black Hood.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.448
It's clear what has to be done.
We cancel the debate.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.366
It's not a risk we can take.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.910
Until the Black Hood's caught,
we have to be careful.

17:16.994 --> 17:19.038
Can you beef up security at the town hall?

17:19.121 --> 17:20.956
-Fred--
-You can't be serious.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.666
We'll lock town hall down tighter.

17:22.750 --> 17:26.295
The town is scared.
They need to be shown we can't be cowed.

17:27.129 --> 17:29.631
Well, if Fred's in, so are we.

17:34.678 --> 17:36.722
<i>You're not the Mrs. Cooper</i>
<i>I was expecting.</i>

17:36.805 --> 17:39.683
Yeah, well, my money is good
just the same.

17:48.817 --> 17:52.780
This poor creature was found
in the men's room of a rest stop.

18:09.505 --> 18:13.383
<i>It's okay, it wasn't Chic.</i>
But it could have been.

18:13.967 --> 18:16.970
Chic is probably out there,
with a bullet in his--

18:17.054 --> 18:20.641
Or he got away
and he's on a train back to Transylvania.

18:20.724 --> 18:23.310
I delivered him to the Black Hood, Cheryl.

18:23.393 --> 18:24.895
That makes me a murderer.

18:25.521 --> 18:28.190
I've been trying to prove
my dad's a killer,

18:28.273 --> 18:31.985
when, really, all I had to do
is look in the mirror. Oh, my God.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.154
He got what he wanted.

18:35.030 --> 18:35.948
We're the same.

18:37.491 --> 18:40.202
None of this is your fault, Betty.

18:40.744 --> 18:43.705
Part of me wanted to punish Chic
for what he did.

18:43.789 --> 18:47.960
If Chic is dead,
that's a psycho's doing, not yours.

18:48.043 --> 18:52.756
I don't know how much longer I can keep
going before I snap and say something.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.343
I think you should say something.

18:57.469 --> 19:01.140
I think you need to confront your father
with as much of the truth as you dare...

19:01.849 --> 19:03.559
and see how he reacts.

19:12.776 --> 19:14.444
I have something to confess.

19:18.907 --> 19:20.534
Well, what is it, honey?

19:24.288 --> 19:27.624
While the Black Hood
was first hurting people...

19:30.085 --> 19:31.503
he was also calling me.

19:32.212 --> 19:33.797
Asking me to do things.

19:35.132 --> 19:36.508
He said I was like him.

19:37.634 --> 19:39.970
He offered to help me get rid of Chic.

19:41.930 --> 19:44.516
So, I delivered Chic to the Black Hood.

19:48.270 --> 19:49.438
If he's dead...

19:51.648 --> 19:54.193
that makes me an accomplice to murder.

19:58.363 --> 19:59.198
And I think...

20:01.158 --> 20:02.451
I'm okay with that.

20:03.952 --> 20:07.706
The truth is there's always been
this darkness inside me.

20:10.751 --> 20:14.087
I thought Chic could help me
understand it, but really...

20:16.840 --> 20:18.634
it was the Black Hood who did.

20:21.803 --> 20:22.638
Honey.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.393
I don't know what to say.

20:32.147 --> 20:32.981
Betty.

20:36.610 --> 20:38.111
I experience it, too.

20:38.695 --> 20:39.571
The darkness.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.617
When I was away from you and your mom...

20:45.953 --> 20:47.955
it felt like I was drowning in it.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.169
It's why we need each other.

21:04.846 --> 21:06.098
Jug. Did you see it?

21:06.598 --> 21:08.308
-Fangs was dating Midge

21:08.392 --> 21:11.770
-and forgot to tell Sheriff Keller.

21:11.853 --> 21:14.231
Posted on the <i>Register's </i>website.
Somebody leaked it.

21:14.314 --> 21:17.401
-It makes Fangs look guilty as sin.
<i>Attention.</i>

21:17.484 --> 21:20.112
<i>This is Principal Weatherbee.</i>
<i>I need Fangs Fogarty</i>

21:20.195 --> 21:22.281
-<i>to come to my office.</i>

21:22.364 --> 21:23.907
-I don't know.
-We have to find him

21:23.991 --> 21:27.828
-before the Dark Circle does.
This video's everywhere.

21:27.911 --> 21:29.871
-We have to get you out.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.790
You're dead, Vixen killer.

21:31.873 --> 21:33.792
-This way.
Mr. Fogarty.

21:33.875 --> 21:36.920
-We need you to come with us.
-I didn't do anything.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.550
Okay, come on, come on. Hey, hey.

21:49.725 --> 21:52.936
I know today's all about the debate,
but I was curious.

21:53.186 --> 21:54.896
Did you get my proposal?

21:54.980 --> 21:58.191
About partnering with Elio's family
on a modestly

21:58.275 --> 21:59.609
I did, yes.

21:59.693 --> 22:02.321
But no business Elio's family runs
is legal.

22:02.404 --> 22:05.866
Their casinos are fronts
for numerous criminal activities.

22:05.949 --> 22:06.825
No, Daddy.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.327
Elio assured me.

22:08.410 --> 22:10.579
This partnership
just doesn't make sense for us.

22:10.662 --> 22:14.291
Not now. Not when we're on the verge
of coming out of the shadows

22:14.583 --> 22:16.460
and into the light ourselves. Surely you understand that?

22:27.804 --> 22:30.932
You don't have to do that.
There's a deputy out there.

22:33.560 --> 22:36.772
What if the deputy falls asleep
and the Black Hood slips past him?

22:39.441 --> 22:42.444
-Look, what happened at Pop's--
-Changed everything.

22:44.112 --> 22:47.407
I really thought you were gonna die, Dad.
I felt...

22:50.160 --> 22:50.994
helpless.

22:52.245 --> 22:53.872
Everything broke that day.

22:53.955 --> 22:56.541
I've been trying to put it back together
ever since.

22:57.542 --> 23:00.629
-First with the Red Circle, and then...

23:02.339 --> 23:03.965
Is that what this is about?

23:04.633 --> 23:06.635
You backing him, working for him?

23:06.968 --> 23:08.720
Makes you feel...

23:08.804 --> 23:11.431
I just hate feeling
like I can't do anything.

23:11.515 --> 23:12.766
I know you do, son.

23:13.683 --> 23:16.645
Especially when it seems
like the world is on fire.

23:29.407 --> 23:30.617
All right, War Dogs.

23:32.536 --> 23:33.745
Let's have some fun.

23:55.058 --> 23:55.976
Jug, what's up?

23:56.059 --> 23:59.020
You and your Dark Circle went wilding
on the Southside last night,

23:59.104 --> 24:01.690
-<i>that's what up.</i>
-That's impossible.

24:01.773 --> 24:04.943
Unless it was some other group
in letterman jackets

24:05.026 --> 24:08.446
who set a dumpster on fire
and slashed our tires.

24:08.530 --> 24:10.407
<i>Archie, Hog Eye saw you guys.</i>

24:10.490 --> 24:12.993
I swear, I don't know anything about this.

24:13.076 --> 24:14.578
-<i>I wasn't there.</i>
-Jughead.

24:15.287 --> 24:16.997
-Attorney McCoy.

24:19.916 --> 24:22.586
You were in Midge Klump's dressing room
doing what?

24:22.669 --> 24:25.172
We were just talking. I didn't kill her.

24:25.255 --> 24:27.674
Didn't you

24:27.757 --> 24:31.887
Don't say another word.
I'll be representing Mr. Fogarty,

24:31.970 --> 24:35.682
and I'd appreciate it
if you'd stopped harassing my client.

24:38.977 --> 24:41.897
You're being held because
you were in possession of a weapon

24:41.980 --> 24:44.524
-on school property.
-For protection.

24:44.608 --> 24:47.402
Yes, they have 24 hours
to make something stick.

24:47.485 --> 24:52.073
In the meantime, you exercise your right
to remain the hell silent.

24:56.244 --> 24:59.456
Have you lost your minds?
Vandalizing the Southside?

24:59.539 --> 25:03.043
-We were celebrating Fangs' arrest.
-That's not something to celebrate.

25:03.126 --> 25:05.545
-He didn't do it.
-He had a knife on him.

25:05.629 --> 25:09.341
We're not having this argument, guys.
The Circle is disbanded.

25:09.424 --> 25:14.262
That's not your decision to make, dude.
You're not the one paying us. Hiram is.

25:15.222 --> 25:16.056
Wait.

25:20.769 --> 25:22.270
Mr. Lodge is paying you?

25:22.354 --> 25:26.816
Yeah. He was the one that suggested
we go out and have a little fun.

25:26.900 --> 25:30.862
Said you might've started the Dark Circle,
but it was mine now.

25:32.030 --> 25:35.325
<i>I'm afraid I've already taken on</i>
<i>my pro bono case for the week.</i>

25:36.743 --> 25:39.829
That should cover an hour of legal advice,
I hope.

25:42.624 --> 25:46.628
-Let's say someone wanted to open a casino

25:46.836 --> 25:47.671
in Riverdale.

25:47.754 --> 25:50.257
For starters,
they'd need a gaming license.

25:50.340 --> 25:52.884
Which are difficult to obtain without...

25:54.386 --> 25:55.387
connections.

25:56.346 --> 25:59.641
Let's say one wanted to do this
strictly aboveboard.

26:12.529 --> 26:13.530
Has he confessed yet?

26:13.613 --> 26:16.700
No, but he said something
about not being his best self

26:16.783 --> 26:19.160
when my mom kicked him out.
Just a hunch,

26:19.244 --> 26:23.123
but I got into his credit card statements,
and he's still making weekly payments

26:23.206 --> 26:26.084
to the ShareBNB he'd been renting
even though he's back at home.

26:26.167 --> 26:29.713
Think it's his serial killer lair?
Tell me we're breaking in.

26:50.108 --> 26:53.570
What are we looking for exactly?
Trophies from his victims?

26:54.154 --> 26:58.450
Just anything unusual or incriminating.

27:04.331 --> 27:05.165
Betty?

27:06.875 --> 27:09.044
Does your father have
an affinity for kiddie lit

27:09.127 --> 27:11.379
or would this be considered unusual?

27:14.549 --> 27:15.383
Cheryl...

27:17.469 --> 27:20.680
the Black Hood used this book
to write the cipher.

27:20.764 --> 27:22.849
The cipher only I could solve.

27:22.932 --> 27:26.311
My dad knew I was obsessed
with this book growing up.

27:30.357 --> 27:32.442
-My God, it's him.
-Don't answer it.

27:33.151 --> 27:34.986
-Hi, Dad.

27:35.070 --> 27:38.823
-Um, I'm at Pop's with Cheryl.
-<i>Your mom and I</i>

27:38.907 --> 27:41.701
are about to head to the debate.
Want us to wait, pick you up?

27:41.785 --> 27:44.287
No, uh, just go ahead.
We'll meet you there.

27:53.296 --> 27:57.884
Daddy. I've done research. I've figured
out how we can make the casino happen

27:57.967 --> 28:01.262
without involving Elio's family.
Legal, like you asked.

28:01.346 --> 28:06.309
I didn't ask. We're moments away from your
mother's debate. So, if we can table this?

28:07.560 --> 28:10.397
Welcome, one and all,
to tonight's mayoral debate.

28:17.028 --> 28:20.907
Jumping right in.
Fear and unrest rule the streets.

28:21.116 --> 28:24.661
Hermione Lodge.
How would you restore safety to the town?

28:24.744 --> 28:27.080
We're already making strides, Alice.

28:27.205 --> 28:31.084
My husband and I
personally recruited Sheriff Minetta

28:31.167 --> 28:33.711
from Centerville
after Tom Keller resigned.

28:33.795 --> 28:35.547
Not one week on the job,

28:36.172 --> 28:38.717
and he's apprehended
Midge Klump's murderer.

28:42.137 --> 28:45.265
-Fred. Rebuttal.
-We don't know if he's the killer.

28:48.810 --> 28:53.940
All I'm saying is let's not call for blood
until we've had a trial.

28:55.984 --> 28:59.237
What does that say about us?
About Riverdale?

28:59.320 --> 29:02.657
You talk about not calling for blood,
Fred.

29:02.741 --> 29:05.660
Are you aware of a group
called the Dark Circle?

29:05.744 --> 29:08.121
-No, I'm not.
-Let me enlighten you.

29:08.204 --> 29:11.666
The Dark Circle is a dangerous,
radical group

29:11.750 --> 29:15.879
that traffics in terror, violence
and street warfare.

29:15.962 --> 29:16.796
A group...

29:18.381 --> 29:21.092
started by your son, Archie.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.848
Now, I ask you, citizens of Riverdale,

29:27.182 --> 29:32.228
how can we trust a man to run a town
when he can't keep his own house in order?

29:33.146 --> 29:35.356
Oh, my God. It's the Black Hood.

29:39.235 --> 29:40.236
Dad.

29:41.613 --> 29:42.447
Mom?

29:47.327 --> 29:48.870
-Betty.
-Dad.

30:01.591 --> 30:03.426
Excuse me. Thank you.

30:04.093 --> 30:07.180
I guess Sheriff Keller's
not looking so bad now, huh?

30:08.598 --> 30:12.769
There's a trapdoor from the balcony
to the roof not on any building plans.

30:12.852 --> 30:16.231
I've got cars all over. He's not gonna
get far. We'll catch him tonight.

30:16.314 --> 30:17.732
Sheriff, if I may?

30:17.941 --> 30:20.026
Archie's come face-to-face
with the Black Hood,

30:20.109 --> 30:22.695
looked him in the eyes.
Maybe he could help identify him.

30:22.779 --> 30:24.239
You up for a ride

30:31.162 --> 30:35.500
I'm gonna head home. Stay with my dad.
Make sure he's safe there.

30:39.462 --> 30:40.421
All right, then.

30:50.849 --> 30:54.102
Just got off the phone with Betty.
The Black Hood turned the town hall

30:54.185 --> 30:56.479
into his own shooting gallery
while Fangs was here.

30:56.563 --> 30:59.107
-What happened tonight

30:59.190 --> 31:02.443
and what happened to Midge
are separate incidents.

31:02.527 --> 31:07.198
But if the sheriff doesn't press charges
in the next hour, he has to let you go.

31:07.740 --> 31:09.492
There are protestors outside.

31:09.576 --> 31:14.163
His release is going to make
a lot of people in this town very unhappy.

31:20.753 --> 31:21.588
Mom.

31:22.589 --> 31:23.798
You're shaking.

31:26.259 --> 31:27.260
I'm fine.

31:27.343 --> 31:29.929
I know you wanna be strong
for the campaign,

31:30.013 --> 31:33.141
but if tonight was any indication
of what's to come...

31:34.851 --> 31:38.813
-maybe you should drop out of the race.
Nobody's withdrawing, <i>mija.</i>

31:40.023 --> 31:42.483
-We've worked hard.

31:42.567 --> 31:45.361
-Can't get skittish now.
-A serial killer played

31:45.445 --> 31:47.196
target practice with Mom.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.116
Your father's right, Veronica.

31:50.199 --> 31:53.161
This campaign is bigger
than what happened tonight.

31:54.162 --> 31:55.496
I'll be fine.

31:55.580 --> 31:59.083
He is willing to put your life
in jeopardy. And for what?

31:59.417 --> 32:02.337
His plan, his vision, his decisions.

32:02.420 --> 32:05.840
-You will show me respect.

32:06.633 --> 32:09.218
When you asked me to entertain
the sons of your enemies?

32:09.302 --> 32:13.348
Or when I tried to tell you
I'd worked everything out with the casino

32:13.473 --> 32:17.101
and you brushed me aside?
Guess what, I'm going ahead with it.

32:18.019 --> 32:20.396
I've done the work and I have the money.

32:21.814 --> 32:24.317
The money you swindled
from the St. Clairs?

32:25.902 --> 32:29.697
You think I'd let my daughter
keep cash like that lying around?

32:29.864 --> 32:31.366
I put it in a trust

32:31.449 --> 32:34.243
that you won't be able to touch
until you're 21.

32:34.702 --> 32:38.206
When hopefully you'll be more rational
and clear-minded.

32:54.347 --> 32:56.182
I'm gonna meet your mom at the <i>Register.</i>

32:56.265 --> 32:58.685
Actually, Dad, I need to talk to you
about something.

33:00.520 --> 33:01.437
I don't know...

33:03.022 --> 33:07.235
what I saw at the town hall,
if that was really the Black Hood...

33:10.697 --> 33:14.951
Cheryl and I went to your ShareBNB
and broke in.

33:18.496 --> 33:19.789
You and Cheryl?

33:19.872 --> 33:21.916
And I found this book...

33:22.000 --> 33:26.170
that the Black Hood used for his cipher
months ago. Why do you have it?

33:26.254 --> 33:29.298
I had no idea
that the Black Hood used that book.

33:30.633 --> 33:36.014
It was your favorite. You checked it out
of the library practically every weekend.

33:36.097 --> 33:39.559
I found a copy online.
I was saving it for your birthday.

33:41.978 --> 33:44.147
What

33:47.316 --> 33:48.985
You didn't think that...?

33:51.320 --> 33:52.155
Oh, Betty.

33:52.238 --> 33:53.364
Wait, wait, so...

33:54.741 --> 33:59.078
this book is really just a present?

33:59.620 --> 34:00.455
For me?

34:00.538 --> 34:01.956
Of course, Betty.

34:05.334 --> 34:06.919
What else would it be?

34:10.757 --> 34:14.886
Dad, I just got back from the station.
Fangs is getting out tonight.

34:17.722 --> 34:21.100
Joaquin. What's he doing here?

34:21.225 --> 34:23.895
I called him.
He's gonna help Fangs disappear.

34:24.771 --> 34:27.482
I can sneak him out to San Junipero.
I got a place there.

34:28.357 --> 34:31.819
Maybe. First,
we need to get him out in one piece.

34:31.903 --> 34:34.864
There's an angry mob outside
yelling for his head.

34:37.825 --> 34:40.244
Something's happening.
It's gonna make you...

34:41.245 --> 34:45.416
and the rest of the Dark Circle
very angry and frustrated.

34:49.504 --> 34:50.588
Fangs Fogarty...

34:52.006 --> 34:53.633
-is being released.

34:53.716 --> 34:58.387
Sometime after midnight. But there's
nothing you or I can do about it.

35:03.226 --> 35:05.853
Short of taking justice
into your own hands.

35:06.687 --> 35:08.689
We must have faith
in the justice system.

35:08.773 --> 35:14.278
Even if it sometimes allows the guilty...
to walk free.

35:20.159 --> 35:22.995
-I came here to see your dad.

35:23.121 --> 35:26.791
-Everything's fine, Mr. Andrews. I just...

35:28.209 --> 35:31.838
I wanted to tell you
that I'm supporting your run for mayor.

35:31.921 --> 35:35.591
I can't, in good conscience,
stand with my father anymore.

35:35.675 --> 35:37.009
I believe in you.

I think we need to finish the conversation
we started earlier.

37:26.786 --> 37:28.621

-No.

37:31.415 --> 37:34.001
Meet me at the place where this all began.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.170
With my speech at town hall.

37:37.546 --> 37:38.547
You understand.

37:40.091 --> 37:43.427
-<i>Of course.</i>
-I want it to just be between you and me.

They're not my guys.

38:16.627 --> 38:19.588

39:06.761 --> 39:09.138

Hey. You're not going to.
