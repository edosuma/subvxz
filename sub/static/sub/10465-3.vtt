for this stuff.

It'd take me, like,
50 hours a week just to keep up,

31:35.501 --> 31:37.000
and I would flunk
the class anyway,

31:37.000 --> 31:38.934

screw everything else up.

41:34.334 --> 41:35.667
Yeah.

41:39.767 --> 41:41.300
What about Sarah?

41:41.300 --> 41:43.300
Eh, who cares.

41:43.300 --> 41:44.901
I've never seen her naked.

41:48.033 --> 41:49.200
[LAUGHS]

42:01.801 --> 42:03.000
[SIGHS]

42:03.000 --> 42:05.100
We're here.

42:05.100 --> 42:06.868
We're home.

42:06.868 --> 42:08.033
Oh.

42:18.934 --> 42:21.467
Go on inside.
I'll get Bay or Julia to help.

42:25.100 --> 42:27.767
I just want to sit here.

42:27.767 --> 42:30.000
Go ahead.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.133
I'll be up in...

42:32.133 --> 42:33.667
in a little bit.

42:39.567 --> 42:41.501

43:17.734 --> 43:19.434
