01:23.750 --> 01:25.584
HO!

01:25.752 --> 01:27.377
ALL RIGHT, BOY,
LET'S HAVE IT.

01:27.545 --> 01:29.546
OH, STOP.
DON'T DO ANYTHING.
HE DIDN'T MEAN IT.

01:29.714 --> 01:31.548
WHAT'S THIS BOY'S NAME?

01:31.716 --> 01:33.050
SOLOMON.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.176
SOLOMON WHAT?

01:34.344 --> 01:36.053
SOLOMON HENRY.
HE'S MY SON.

01:36.221 --> 01:37.513
WELL, HE'S A THIEF.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.098
HE STOLE THIS
OFF THE SCHOOL STEPS.

01:39.265 --> 01:40.557
I GOT A MIND
TO WHIP HIM GOOD.

01:40.725 --> 01:43.852
NO, PLEASE DON'T.
HE DIDN'T KNOW
NO BETTER.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.563
ALL RIGHT. I'LL LET HIM
GO THIS TIME,

01:46.731 --> 01:48.565
BUT I'M GONNA
REMEMBER HIS NAME.

01:48.733 --> 01:50.943
HE STEALS ANYTHING ELSE,
AND YOU'VE SEEN THE LAST
OF EMMETSBURG

01:51.111 --> 01:52.694
OR ANY OTHER TOWN
AROUND HERE.

02:04.749 --> 02:06.083
LOOK WHAT
YOU'VE DONE.

02:06.251 --> 02:08.585
STEALING THAT
MAN'S BOOK.
HOW COULD YOU?

02:08.753 --> 02:10.420
I DIDN'T STEAL IT,
MAMA.

02:10.588 --> 02:11.463
I JUST BORROWED IT.

02:11.631 --> 02:12.631
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WE--

02:12.799 --> 02:15.968
DID YOU ASK HIM?
DID YOU ASK
ANYBODY?

02:16.136 --> 02:17.302
THEN YOU STOLE IT.

02:17.470 --> 02:18.554
AND YOU'VE SHAMED
ALL OF US

02:18.721 --> 02:21.431
WHO'VE COME HERE
FOR A FRESH START.

02:21.599 --> 02:24.101
OH, SOLOMON.

02:24.269 --> 02:25.227
WHY?

02:25.395 --> 02:27.938
WHAT GOT INTO YOU?

02:28.106 --> 02:30.023
I JUST WANTED
TO LOOK AT IT.

02:30.191 --> 02:32.234
YOU JUST WANTED
TO LOOK AT IT.

02:32.402 --> 02:35.320
THEY'D HAVE BEAT YOU
HALF TO DEATH
BACK HOME FOR THAT.

02:35.488 --> 02:38.907
I WANT LEARNIN', MAMA.

02:39.075 --> 02:41.285
I WANNA READ.

02:41.452 --> 02:44.746
I WANNA GO TO SCHOOL
LIKE ALL THEM OTHER CHILDREN.

02:44.914 --> 02:47.082
THAT'S THE WHITE MAN'S
SCHOOL, HONEY.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.001
YOU CAN'T GO THERE.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.004
WHY?

02:52.172 --> 02:54.006
IF WE'RE FREE,
WHY CAN'T I?

02:54.174 --> 02:56.633
YOU'RE FREE TO BE
WHAT THE WHITE FOLKS
WANT YOU TO BE.

02:56.801 --> 02:58.760
NOW, THEY GIVE US
THIS LITTLE PIECE
OF LAND TO WORK,

02:58.928 --> 03:00.262
AND THAT'S
THE WHOLE OF IT.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.472
MAMA'S RIGHT.

03:02.640 --> 03:03.849
YOU'RE GONNA GET US
NOTHING BUT TROUBLE

03:04.017 --> 03:05.601
YOU DON'T STAY
IN YOUR PLACE.

03:05.768 --> 03:07.394
I AIN'T A SLAVE.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.021
NOBODY SAID YOU WAS.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.815
IF I CAN ONLY BE
WHAT THE WHITE FOLKS
WANT ME TO BE,

03:11.983 --> 03:14.526
THEN I'S A SLAVE
AS MUCH AS PAPA WAS.

03:14.694 --> 03:15.986
NOW YOU
LISTEN TO ME.

03:16.154 --> 03:19.156
WE GOT A CHANCE HERE
AND YOU AIN'T GONNA
SPOIL IT.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.742
YOU DO LIKE I SAY
AND MIND YOUR PLACE,

03:21.910 --> 03:23.160
OR YOU CAN GO.

03:23.328 --> 03:26.413
NOW, YOU MAKE UP
YOUR MIND RIGHT NOW.

03:29.250 --> 03:30.167
SOLOMON.

03:30.335 --> 03:31.501
YOU DON'T COME
BACK HERE NOW,

03:31.669 --> 03:34.129
YOU DON'T
NEVER COME BACK!

03:34.297 --> 03:36.006

03:36.174 --> 03:37.716
I MEAN IT!

03:38.885 --> 03:40.219
I'LL GET HIM, MAMA.

03:41.763 --> 03:42.846
NO.

03:44.933 --> 03:47.559
HE DONE MADE UP
HIS MIND.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.937
LORD HELP HIM.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.821
HERE YOU GO,
MR. KRAMER.

24 CRATES.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.699
I CAN COUNT.

04:43.866 --> 04:46.660

SORRY TO BE SO LATE.

04:46.828 --> 04:48.912
WELL, DON'T BE.
WE HAVEN'T
SETTLED UP YET.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.038
HERE'S THE BILL.

04:50.206 --> 04:52.165
I'LL CARRY
THESE CRATES DOWN THERE.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.710
Mr. Kramer:
ALL RIGHT, 24.
STEP INSIDE.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.804
I APPRECIATE THE HELP,
DR. TANE.

05:05.972 --> 05:09.516
THESE CRATES OF MEDICINE
GET A LITTLE HEAVIER
EVERY YEAR.

05:09.684 --> 05:12.728
THAT'S THE LEAST
I CAN DO AFTER
YOUR GENEROUS OFFER.

05:12.895 --> 05:13.937
NOT SO GENEROUS.

05:14.105 --> 05:16.815
MY OFFICE IS
OVERFLOWING WITH SAMPLES.

05:16.983 --> 05:19.818
SEEMS LIKE THERE'S
A NEW MEDICINE COMES OUT
EVERY 5 MINUTES.

05:19.986 --> 05:23.280
ANY MEDICINE
I CAN GET IS
GREATLY APPRECIATED.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.365
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY THE GOVERNMENT

05:25.533 --> 05:28.535
DOESN'T SEND PROPER
MEDICAL SUPPLIES
TO THE RESERVATION.

05:31.748 --> 05:32.914
WHY SHOULD THEY?

05:33.082 --> 05:35.208
IT'S JUST
FOR INDIANS.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.671
ALL READY

11:52.503 --> 11:53.837
FOR A LITTLE WHILE,
ANYWAY.

11:54.004 --> 11:55.171
GO ON.
GET THE EGGS.

11:55.339 --> 11:57.757
WISH I HAD
A DIFFERENT JOB.

12:00.761 --> 12:02.303
ALL THOSE HISTORY DATES,

12:02.471 --> 12:04.222
PROBABLY COULDN'T USE 'EM
EVEN IF I REMEMBERED 'EM ALL.

12:04.390 --> 12:08.268
LEARNING ABOUT DEAD PEOPLE
AND WARS AND PEOPLE
THAT KILL AND...

12:12.898 --> 12:15.275
I TOLD THEM I SAW YOU.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.193
WHAT YOU DOING?

12:17.361 --> 12:20.405
UH...I'M SUCKING A EGG.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.031
DON'T TELL NOBODY.

12:22.199 --> 12:23.158
I WAS HUNGRY.

12:23.325 --> 12:26.286
ARE YOU A FOR-REAL
NEGRO PERSON?

12:29.999 --> 12:31.124
WHAT YOU DOING?

12:32.334 --> 12:34.669
YOU ARE A REAL ONE!

12:34.837 --> 12:35.962
AS A FACT!

12:36.130 --> 12:38.381
I'VE NEVER SEEN
A REAL NEGRO PERSON
BEFORE.

12:38.549 --> 12:40.592
DON'T TELL YOUR PA
ABOUT THE EGG.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.552
HE'LL WHIP ME
THIS TIME FOR SURE.

12:42.720 --> 12:43.636
YOU KNOW HIM?

12:43.804 --> 12:44.888
KINDA.

12:45.055 --> 12:46.306
THAT'S WHY I FOLLOWED
YOU HOME FROM SCHOOL.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.808
I THOUGHT
I HEARD SOMEBODY
TALKING IN HERE.

12:48.976 --> 12:51.060
NO, NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
NOBODY'S GONNA HURT YOU.

12:51.228 --> 12:53.563
HE'S AFRAID YOU'RE
GONNA WHIP HIM, PA.

12:53.731 --> 12:55.482
WHAT IN THE WORLD FOR?

12:57.651 --> 12:59.486
I SUCKED
ONE OF YOUR EGGS.

12:59.653 --> 13:02.572
OH, I SEE.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.533
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
YOU'LL PROBABLY BE
WANTING A GLASS OF MILK.

13:05.701 --> 13:07.118
HALF-PINT, WHY DON'T YOU
BRING HIM IN THE HOUSE?

13:07.286 --> 13:08.495
SURE, PA.

13:08.662 --> 13:09.621
COME ON.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.956
COME ON.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

13:12.124 --> 13:13.750
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
COME ON.

13:13.918 --> 13:16.002
COME ON.
WATCH OUT FOR
THE CHICKENS.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.420
COME ON.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.967
LOOK AT THAT.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.053
BOY, IS MISS BEADLE
GONNA BE SORRY

13:25.221 --> 13:27.138
SHE DIDN'T
BELIEVE ME.

13:27.306 --> 13:28.389
COME ON.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.897
SOLOMON,
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME MORE MILK?

13:36.065 --> 13:39.943
NO, MA'AM.
I'M READY TO BUST NOW.

13:40.110 --> 13:42.612
SHE'S NEVER SEEN
A REAL NEGRO
PERSON, NEITHER.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.823
OH.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.282
SOLOMON,
NOW THAT YOU'VE HAD
SOMETHING TO EAT,

13:46.450 --> 13:49.077
MAYBE WE OUGHTA
GET DOWN TO CASES, HUH?

13:50.454 --> 13:52.580
HOW'D YOU GET HERE?

13:52.748 --> 13:55.166
I JUMPED ON THE BACK
OF YOUR WAGON.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.918
WHAT FOR?

13:59.630 --> 14:00.463
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

14:00.631 --> 14:03.675
I THINK 11, SIR.

14:04.718 --> 14:07.303
AND YOUR FAMILY LIVES
IN MANKATO, RIGHT?

14:07.471 --> 14:08.972
THEY DID, SIR.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.600
WELL, YOU MUST HAVE
SOME FAMILY.

14:12.768 --> 14:15.186
NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

14:18.148 --> 14:19.315
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

14:21.277 --> 14:23.069
MISSISSIPPI.

14:23.237 --> 14:25.488
I THINK
I WAS BORN THERE.

14:25.656 --> 14:28.074
THEN I WAS IN VIRGINIA
FOR SOME TIME.

14:28.242 --> 14:29.534
THEN...

14:31.245 --> 14:33.288
MY FOLKS DIED.

14:33.455 --> 14:38.042
SINCE THEN, I'VE JUST BEEN
SCUFFLING AROUND BY MYSELF.

14:39.003 --> 14:40.086
DOING WHAT?

14:41.005 --> 14:42.213
WORKING HERE AND THERE.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.048
I'M A LOT STRONGER
THAN I LOOK.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.342
I WORK
A 2-MULE TEAM ALL DAY

14:46.510 --> 14:49.220
AND A CROSS-CUT SAW
THAT'S TWICE MY SIZE.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.307
BUT I AIN'T DONE
MUCH HOUSEWORK.

14:52.474 --> 14:54.642
BUT I COULD PICK UP
ON IT REAL FAST.

14:54.810 --> 14:57.937
SEE? LOOKEE HERE,
SEE HERE?

15:02.860 --> 15:05.028
"FOR SALE...

15:05.195 --> 15:06.654
"HEALTHY BOY,
11 YEARS OLD,

15:06.822 --> 15:09.032
"87 POUNDS.

15:09.199 --> 15:12.368
GOOD FOR HOUSE OR FIELD.
VERY OBEDIENT."

15:12.536 --> 15:13.745
THAT'S MY DADDY.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.455
THAT'S ALL
I KNOW OF HIM.

15:15.623 --> 15:18.207
I WAS THINKING
I COULD DO
LIKE HE DID--

15:18.375 --> 15:20.460
GET BOUGHT
BY SOME FOLKS.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.128
MAYBE LIKE YOU.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.589
I'D BE A RIGHT
GOOD SLAVE.

15:26.091 --> 15:28.635
WELL, SOLOMON,
THIS PAPER IS DATED 1854.

15:28.802 --> 15:30.303
THAT'S A LONG TIME AGO.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.889
FOLKS CAN'T
SELL THEMSELVES ANYMORE.

15:33.057 --> 15:34.307
WHO SAYS?

15:35.142 --> 15:36.059
WELL, I KNOW WALNUT GROVE

15:36.226 --> 15:37.727
MUST SEEM LIKE
THE END OF THE WORLD,

15:37.895 --> 15:40.229
BUT EVEN WE'VE HEARD
ABOUT THE EMANCIPATION
PROCLAMATION.

15:41.857 --> 15:44.108
I HEARD ABOUT IT, TOO.

15:44.276 --> 15:45.443
WELL, IF YOU HEARD
WHAT I HEARD

15:45.611 --> 15:47.570
THEN YOU MUST KNOW THAT
WHEN LINCOLN SIGNED IT,

15:47.738 --> 15:49.072
THAT ENDED SLAVERY
FOREVER.

15:49.239 --> 15:52.075
I FIGURE A PERSON
BELONGS TO HISSELF,

15:52.242 --> 15:54.327
AND HE OUGHTA BE ABLE
TO SELL WHAT'S HIS

15:54.495 --> 15:56.704
WHETHER LINCOLN
LIKES IT OR NOT.

15:56.872 --> 15:59.582
Caroline:
SOLOMON, WHY WOULD
YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

15:59.750 --> 16:01.584
TO GET MONEY
FOR SCHOOLING.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.170
YOU'VE NEVER
BEEN TO SCHOOL?

16:04.338 --> 16:06.464
AREN'T NO SCHOOLS.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.091
NOT FOR US.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.136
I WANNA LEARN
TO WRITE MY NAME FIRST

16:12.304 --> 16:14.222
AND EVERYTHING ELSE
AFTER THAT...

16:14.390 --> 16:17.433
READING AND FIGURING,

16:17.601 --> 16:18.935
AND LEARNING

16:19.103 --> 16:21.020
ABOUT THE WHOLE WORLD
AND EVERYTHING.

16:21.188 --> 16:24.023
AND I GOT A GOOD
EAR FOR IT, TOO.

16:25.109 --> 16:28.194
IF YOU WAS TO BUY ME,
I WOULDN'T BE MUCH.

16:28.362 --> 16:29.362
YOU CAN NAME
THE PRICE,

16:29.530 --> 16:31.614
JUST SO I HAVE ENOUGH
FOR A BOOK OR TWO.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.282
YOU WOULDN'T
BE SORRY.

16:33.450 --> 16:36.035
I CAN WORK UP TILL
SUNUP TO SUNDOWN.

16:39.248 --> 16:40.373
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
SOLOMON.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.417
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
THINK ABOUT IT, HUH?

16:42.584 --> 16:44.377
MEANTIME, WE'LL FIX YOU UP
WITH A PLACE TO SLEEP

16:44.545 --> 16:45.503
UP IN THE SODDY.

16:45.671 --> 16:48.464
YOU CAN DO SOME CHORES
TO EARN YOUR KEEP.

16:48.632 --> 16:50.133
TOMORROW, I'LL TAKE
YOU INTO TOWN,

16:50.300 --> 16:52.135
SEE ABOUT GETTING
YOU STARTED IN SCHOOL.
HOW'S THAT SOUND?

16:52.302 --> 16:54.804
THAT'S FINE
WITH ME, SIR.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.848
OK, COME ON.
WE'LL GET YOU
BEDDED DOWN.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.226
THAT WAS
A GOOD MEAL, MA'AM.

17:00.394 --> 17:01.644
THANK YOU,
SOLOMON.
GOOD NIGHT.

17:01.812 --> 17:02.979
GOOD NIGHT.
'NIGHT, SOLOMON.

17:03.147 --> 17:05.773
GOOD NIGHT, SOLOMON.
GOOD NIGHT.

17:06.942 --> 17:09.318
WAIT'LL THEY SEE HIM
AT SCHOOL.

17:09.486 --> 17:12.321
A GENUINE
NEGRO PERSON.

17:20.914 --> 17:22.331
WELL, THERE YOU GO, SOLOMON.

17:22.499 --> 17:23.750
YOU GET YOURSELF
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP

17:23.917 --> 17:25.126
AND I'LL SEE YOU
IN THE MORNING,
ALL RIGHT?

17:25.294 --> 17:27.503
YES, SIR.

17:27.671 --> 17:28.504
SIR?

17:28.672 --> 17:30.423
YEAH?

17:30.591 --> 17:33.384
IF YOU'RE A LITTLE
SHORT OF CASH TO
BUY ME RIGHT OFF,

17:33.552 --> 17:35.678
YOU CAN ALWAYS
PAY FOR ME ON TIME,

17:35.846 --> 17:36.929
JUST SO I GOT ENOUGH
FOR A LITTLE BIT

17:37.097 --> 17:38.639
A MONTH
OR SOMETHING.

17:41.518 --> 17:42.643
WELL, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH, SOLOMON.

17:42.811 --> 17:43.936
I'LL, UH...

17:44.104 --> 17:45.813
I'LL THINK ABOUT THAT.

17:45.981 --> 17:47.231
GOOD NIGHT.

18:07.711 --> 18:10.963
OOH. HOPE HE'S WARM
ENOUGH OUT THERE.

18:11.131 --> 18:12.381
WELL, I'M SURE
HE'S WARMER UP THERE

18:12.549 --> 18:13.966
THAN WHERE HE'S BEEN
SLEEPING UP TILL NOW.

18:14.134 --> 18:15.718
[CAROLINE SIGHS]

18:15.886 --> 18:16.803
[LAUGHS]

18:16.970 --> 18:18.262
HE IS A FUNNY
LITTLE GUY.

18:18.430 --> 18:19.931
KNOW WHAT HE SAID
TO ME TONIGHT?

18:20.099 --> 18:22.850
HE SAID IF WE WERE
IN A PINCH, WE COULD
BUY HIM ON TIME.

18:25.729 --> 18:27.772
HE MUST HAVE SOME FAMILY
SOMEWHERE.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.315
YEAH, I THINK HE DOES.

18:29.483 --> 18:31.692
I'M NOT SO SURE
HE WAS TELLING
THE TRUTH ABOUT THAT.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.569
THEY'RE GONNA BE
AWFUL HARD TO FIND.

18:33.737 --> 18:37.281
WELL, HE CAN'T JUST STAY
IN THAT SODDY FOREVER.

18:37.449 --> 18:38.574
HE'S A LOT BETTER
UP THERE

18:38.742 --> 18:40.743
THAN HE IS WANDERING
AROUND THE COUNTRYSIDE.

18:40.911 --> 18:43.079
I'LL GET HIM SETTLED
IN SCHOOL TOMORROW.

18:43.247 --> 18:46.457
I'LL DRIVE INTO MANKATO,
ASK AROUND ABOUT HIM.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.335
YOU KNOW, CHARLES,
IT'S FUNNY.

18:49.503 --> 18:50.837
WHAT'S THAT?

18:51.004 --> 18:53.381
WE WORRY SO MUCH
ABOUT OUR CHILDREN,

18:53.549 --> 18:54.966
LOOK OVER THEM,

18:55.134 --> 18:56.384
PROTECT THEM.

18:56.552 --> 18:59.095
AND HERE'S THIS LITTLE BOY
NO BIGGER THAN A MINUTE,

18:59.263 --> 19:01.139
DOING FOR HIMSELF.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.559
HE'S A SPECIAL
LITTLE GUY.

19:06.019 --> 19:08.104
WELL, I THINK
I'D BETTER GET
SOME SLEEP.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.689
I HAVE A FEELING
I'M GONNA
NEED MY REST

19:09.857 --> 19:12.066
TO KEEP UP
WITH SOLOMON.

19:12.234 --> 19:13.693
GOOD NIGHT.
SLEEP WELL.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.119
HA HA HA!

19:23.287 --> 19:24.912
WHAT?

19:25.080 --> 19:27.623
HE'S GONNA LET ME
BUY HIM ON TIME.

19:27.791 --> 19:29.542
HE'S JUST SO CUTE.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.210
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!

19:35.924 --> 19:37.550
ALMOST DONE, SON.

19:37.718 --> 19:39.635
I HOPE SO, SIR.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.264
Caroline: HERE ARE
YOUR BRITCHES, SOLOMON.

19:43.432 --> 19:47.643
HI, SOL--
IT'S ALMOST 8:00.

19:47.811 --> 19:52.356
HA! WE'LL BE RIGHT OUT.
HA HA HA!

19:53.483 --> 19:56.319
HA HA HA!

19:56.486 --> 19:59.488
HEY! HA HA HA!

19:59.656 --> 20:01.741
YOU CAN COME UP NOW.
THEY'RE GONE.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.744
COME ON.
LET'S DRY YOU OFF.

20:06.163 --> 20:08.372
THERE.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.041
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
YOU COLD?

20:10.209 --> 20:13.169
NO, SIR.
I'M MOSTLY SCARED,
I GUESS.

20:13.337 --> 20:15.338
WELL, EVERYBODY HAS GOT
A LITTLE FIRST-DAY JITTERS

20:15.505 --> 20:17.048
WHEN THEY'RE GOING
TO A NEW SCHOOL.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.925
BACK HOME,
THERE WAS BIG TROUBLE

20:19.092 --> 20:21.719
WHEN TEACHER HAD LET
SOME COLORED CHILDREN
IN THE SCHOOL.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.512
WELL, DON'T YOU
WORRY ABOUT THAT.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.806
NOTHING IS GONNA HAPPEN
LIKE THAT IN WALNUT GROVE.

20:25.974 --> 20:29.518
NOW YOU FINISH DRYING OFF
WHILE I HITCH UP THE TEAM.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.298
Charles:
HERE WE GO, EVERYBODY.

21:11.353 --> 21:12.937
GOOD MORNING,
MRS. OLESON.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.480
WELL, GOOD MORNING,
MR. INGALLS.

21:14.648 --> 21:16.065
WHO HAVE WE HERE?

21:16.233 --> 21:17.775
OH, THIS IS
SOLOMON HENRY.

21:17.943 --> 21:20.069
HE'S GONNA BE
STARTING SCHOOL HERE.

21:20.237 --> 21:21.404
OH, REALLY?

21:21.571 --> 21:24.240
HAS YOUR FAMILY
MOVED HERE, SOLOMON?

21:24.408 --> 21:25.283
NO, MA'AM.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.659
NO, SOLOMON'S
STAYING WITH US.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.035
OH, I SEE.

21:28.203 --> 21:29.412
YEAH, WE'D BETTER
GET INSIDE.

21:29.579 --> 21:31.247
DON'T WANT TO BE LATE
OUR FIRST DAY AT SCHOOL.

21:31.415 --> 21:32.915
MR. INGALLS!

21:33.083 --> 21:34.125
YEAH?

21:34.293 --> 21:37.086
UH, COULD I SEE YOU
FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE?

21:37.254 --> 21:38.212
CERTAINLY.
WHY DON'T YOU
GO ON INSIDE?

21:38.380 --> 21:39.588
I'LL BE
RIGHT IN.

21:42.467 --> 21:44.719
MR. INGALLS...

21:44.886 --> 21:47.763
WELL, I DON'T
WANT YOU TO GET
THE WRONG IDEA.

21:47.931 --> 21:50.016
OH, I'M SURE I WON'T,
MRS. OLESON. WHAT IS IT?

21:50.183 --> 21:52.435
WELL...

21:52.602 --> 21:53.769
UH...

21:53.937 --> 21:55.146
WELL, I WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT IT
HAS NOTHING TO DO

21:55.314 --> 21:57.315
WITH THE FACT
THAT...

21:57.482 --> 21:58.607
OH, THAT SOLOMON'S
A NEGRO.

21:58.775 --> 22:00.526
YES! UH...

22:00.694 --> 22:01.777
YES.

22:01.945 --> 22:04.155
I AM A MEMBER
OF THE SCHOOL BOARD,
MR. INGALLS,

22:04.323 --> 22:05.531
AND I WOULD LIKE
TO REMIND YOU

22:05.699 --> 22:08.451
THAT NO CHILD
IS ALLOWED TO
ATTEND THIS SCHOOL

22:08.618 --> 22:11.412
UNLESS HIS FAMILY
LIVES IN THIS
TOWNSHIP.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.581
OH, I UNDERSTAND THAT,
MRS. OLESON.

22:14.624 --> 22:15.624
OH.

22:15.792 --> 22:17.626
WELL, BUT THE BOY
SAID THAT HIS FAMILY

22:17.794 --> 22:19.003
DOESN'T LIVE HERE.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.504
OH, I KNOW WHAT HE SAID,
BUT HE WAS JUST SAYING THAT

22:20.672 --> 22:22.298
TO MAKE THINGS EASIER ON ME.

22:22.466 --> 22:23.674
OH?

22:23.842 --> 22:26.052
YEAH, YOU SEE,
SOLOMON IS MY SON
BY A FORMER MARRIAGE.

22:26.219 --> 22:27.386
I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND,

22:27.554 --> 22:29.138
BUT A LOT OF THE PEOPLE
IN THIS TOWN WOULDN'T.

22:29.306 --> 22:30.556

22:32.601 --> 22:34.769
[WHISPERING]
Good grief.

22:43.862 --> 22:45.821
I KNOW I SHOULD'VE
GIVEN YOU A LITTLE NOTICE,

22:45.989 --> 22:47.990
BUT SOLOMON CAME TO US
RATHER UNEXPECTEDLY.

22:48.158 --> 22:49.325
I UNDERSTAND.

22:49.493 --> 22:50.993
HE'S NEVER BEEN
TO SCHOOL BEFORE,

22:51.161 --> 22:52.495
AND IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY.

22:52.662 --> 22:54.580
WELL, DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL TAKE IT
SLOWLY AT FIRST.

22:54.748 --> 22:56.082
I WANT YOU

IT'S WONDERFUL

22:57.667 --> 22:59.293
THERE'S NOT MANY
WOULD TAKE IN
A BOY LIKE THAT.

22:59.461 --> 23:01.504
I'M NOT SO SURE
SOLOMON GAVE ME
MUCH CHOICE.

23:01.671 --> 23:02.797
I'D BETTER
GET TO WORK.

WHILE YOU'RE HERE,

I HAD YOU WRITE AN ESSAY

23:44.214 --> 23:46.048
ABOUT THE THINGS
THAT YOU LIKE THE MOST.

23:46.216 --> 23:47.633
THIS WEEK, I THOUGHT
IT MIGHT BE FUN

23:47.801 --> 23:48.884
IF WE WROTE AN ESSAY

23:49.052 --> 23:51.679

24:18.790 --> 24:20.082
YES, MA'AM?

24:20.250 --> 24:23.002
CAN YOU THINK OF
SOMETHING THAT
YOU DISLIKE?

24:26.423 --> 24:28.632
BEING A NIGGER.

24:56.411 --> 24:57.995
MORNING, MR. KRAMER.
I WONDER IF YOU
COULD HELP ME.

24:58.163 --> 24:59.914

I'M COUNTING.

25:01.374 --> 25:02.208

25:02.375 --> 25:03.959

YOU WERE WANTING?

25:04.127 --> 25:05.544
WELL, IT'S ABOUT THAT
LITTLE BLACK BOY
THAT WAS HERE YESTERDAY.

25:05.712 --> 25:06.587
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

25:06.755 --> 25:07.880
WELL, HAD YOU EVER
SEEN HIM BEFORE?

25:08.048 --> 25:09.465
YOU KNOW IF
HE LIVES AROUND HERE?

25:09.633 --> 25:11.425
NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

25:11.593 --> 25:13.677
HIS NAME'S SOLOMON HENRY.
DOES THAT RING A BELL?

25:13.845 --> 25:15.804
NOPE. WHAT YOU
WANNA KNOW FOR?

25:15.972 --> 25:17.681
I'VE GOT HIM WORKING
OUT AT MY PLACE,

25:17.849 --> 25:19.600
AND I WAS TRYING TO FIND OUT
IF HE HAD ANY FAMILY.

25:19.768 --> 25:22.311

STEAL YOU BLIND.

25:24.231 --> 25:25.898

FALL ASLEEP.
WHAT TIME IS IT?

25:54.344 --> 25:55.344
IT'S ABOUT 9:00.

25:55.512 --> 25:57.012

26:01.434 --> 26:03.519
I WANT TO STRETCH
MY LEGS A LITTLE BIT.

I COME BACK DOWN.

26:10.026 --> 26:12.361
OK.

26:12.529 --> 26:13.737
I WAS ALMOST FINISHED.

26:13.905 --> 26:15.531
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS
IS THE LITTLE GIRL

26:15.699 --> 26:17.992
WHO HATES HOMEWORK.

26:18.159 --> 26:19.410
IT'S SOLOMON, I GUESS.

26:19.578 --> 26:20.661
SOLOMON?

26:22.706 --> 26:23.831
YEAH.

26:23.999 --> 26:25.916
HE WANTS TO LEARN SO BAD.

26:26.084 --> 26:28.877
HE NEVER HAD THE CHANCE
BEFORE.

26:29.045 --> 26:31.839
MAKES ME FEEL KINDA GUILTY,
I GUESS.

26:33.550 --> 26:37.219
HERE I'VE GOT
A SCHOOL AND A FAMILY.

26:38.513 --> 26:39.722
I DON'T KNOW.

26:39.889 --> 26:41.765
YOU MEAN YOU JUST
SUDDENLY REALIZED

26:41.933 --> 26:43.892
THERE'S A LOT

26:45.645 --> 26:47.313
YEAH, I GUESS SO.

26:47.480 --> 26:50.065
WELL, EVERYBODY TAKES
THINGS FOR GRANTED
FROM TIME TO TIME.

26:50.233 --> 26:52.234
YOU'RE NO DIFFERENT
THAN ANYBODY ELSE.

26:52.402 --> 26:54.737
THE IMPORTANT THING IS

26:54.904 --> 26:56.697
YOU REALIZED IT.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.907
YOU'RE DOING
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

YOUR THINGS OFF,
I WANT THAT LIGHT OUT.

27:29.606 --> 27:30.773
NO MORE STUDYING.

27:30.940 --> 27:32.232

NOTHIN' BAD.

27:54.005 --> 27:55.005

ASKED A QUESTION,

27:55.173 --> 27:57.383
AND I JUST ANSWERED IT.

27:57.550 --> 27:59.176

35:05.269 --> 35:07.229
YOU THINK ANYTHING'S
GONNA CHANGE?

35:07.396 --> 35:08.605
IT AIN'T.

35:08.773 --> 35:10.899
WHITE FOLKS AIN'T
GONNA LET IT CHANGE.

35:11.067 --> 35:12.818
THEY WILL.

35:14.403 --> 35:16.071
WHAT YOU THINK
YOU'RE GONNA BE, BOY?

35:17.406 --> 35:20.075
SOME KIND OF DOCTOR

35:20.243 --> 35:22.744
I CAN BE ANYTHING
I WANNA BE.

35:22.912 --> 35:25.288
YOU WANNA BE WHITE, BOY?

35:26.791 --> 35:28.333
CAN'T BE THAT.

35:33.089 --> 35:34.881
I CAN MAKE YOU
COME WITH ME.

35:36.092 --> 35:38.844
I JUST COULD
RUN AWAY AGAIN.

35:43.266 --> 35:48.186
ALL RIGHT.

36:05.872 --> 36:08.206
MAMA MADE THIS FOR YOU.

36:08.374 --> 36:10.458
SHE SAID MAKE SURE

IS HE FEELING SICK?

40:10.616 --> 40:11.616
NO.

40:11.784 --> 40:14.202
THE GIRLS SAID
NOTHING HAPPENED

40:30.886 --> 40:31.970
HOW COME NO SUPPER THEN?

40:32.138 --> 40:33.638

40:36.225 --> 40:37.725
YOU KNOW, SOLOMON,
WHEN PEOPLE ARE FRIENDS,

40:37.893 --> 40:39.602
THEY HAVE TO SHARE
WITH EACH OTHER.

40:39.770 --> 40:42.021
THEY HAVE TO--
THEY HAVE TO BE
HONEST WITH EACH OTHER.

40:42.189 --> 40:44.441
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
YOU CAN WORK OUT A PROBLEM.

40:44.608 --> 40:47.527
AIN'T NO WAY TO
WORK OUT THIS PROBLEM.

40:47.695 --> 40:49.404
WELL, WE CAN SURE TRY,
CAN'T WE?

40:50.948 --> 40:52.740
TALKED TO THAT
DR. TANE TODAY.

40:52.908 --> 40:55.243
HE SAID HE COULDN'T
DO HIS DOCTORING HERE.

40:55.411 --> 40:57.495
HE SAID THE WHITE FOLKS
WOULDN'T LET HIM.

40:57.663 --> 40:58.997
IS THAT THE TRUTH?

41:00.708 --> 41:03.334
YOU JUST SAID
WE GOTTA BE HONEST
WITH EACH OTHER.

41:06.922 --> 41:08.798
YEAH, THAT'S THE TRUTH.

41:10.885 --> 41:11.926

UNDERSTAND--

41:12.094 --> 41:15.013
THAT WE DIFFERENT?

41:16.932 --> 41:20.768
SOLOMON, THERE'S
A LOT OF GOOD FOLKS
IN WALNUT GROVE.

41:20.936 --> 41:22.812
BUT YOU KNOW,
WHEN PEOPLE SPEND
THEIR WHOLE LIVES

41:22.980 --> 41:25.607
THINKING A CERTAIN WAY,
IT...

41:25.774 --> 41:27.317
IT JUST TAKES TIME
FOR THEM TO CHANGE.

41:27.485 --> 41:28.860
AND IF THEY DON'T?

41:29.028 --> 41:31.446
WE GO TO
THE SAME SCHOOL,
LEARN THE SAME,

41:31.614 --> 41:33.114
BUT IT DON'T MAKE
NO DIFFERENCE.

41:33.282 --> 41:36.743
WHEN WE DONE,
NOTHING'S CHANGED.

41:36.911 --> 41:37.952
ALL I'M STILL
GOOD FOR

41:38.120 --> 41:40.371
IS WALKING
BEHIND A PLOW.

41:41.499 --> 41:42.790
I WALK BEHIND A PLOW.

41:42.958 --> 41:45.376
THAT'S YOUR CHOICE.
I AIN'T GOT A CHOICE.

41:45.544 --> 41:47.337
DON'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE
TO LEARN SOMETHING

41:47.505 --> 41:49.297
IF YOU CAN'T USE 'EM.

41:49.465 --> 41:51.883
MY MAMA AND BROTHER
TRIED TO TELL ME THAT.

41:57.806 --> 41:59.891
THERE'S SOME MORE
OF THE TRUTH.

42:01.769 --> 42:03.394
I GOT A FAMILY.

42:03.562 --> 42:05.855
MY BROTHER CAME HERE
TO FETCH ME BACK.

42:06.023 --> 42:08.149
BUT I TOLD HIM NO.

42:08.317 --> 42:10.652
I WAS WRONG.

42:10.819 --> 42:13.154
I GOTTA GO BACK
TO MY MAMA.

42:14.490 --> 42:15.949
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US
YOU HAD A FAMILY?

42:16.116 --> 42:17.992
'CAUSE I WANTED
TO BE WITH YOU,

42:18.160 --> 42:20.328
PRETEND YOU
WERE MY FAMILY.

42:20.496 --> 42:22.747
BUT IT AIN'T
NO GOOD PRETENDING.

42:25.709 --> 42:27.835
I BEST TO BE
GOING TOMORROW.

42:47.189 --> 42:49.440
I'M GONNA MISS YOU,
SOLOMON HENRY.

43:11.046 --> 43:13.548
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

43:13.716 --> 43:15.425
IT'S ALMOST TIME
TO GO TO TOWN.

43:15.593 --> 43:17.218
I'M ALL READY.

43:17.386 --> 43:19.012
THE STAGE DOESN'T
LEAVE UNTIL 8:30.

43:19.179 --> 43:21.180
YOU COULD GO SAY GOOD-BYE
TO MISS BEADLE IF YOU WANT.

43:21.348 --> 43:23.391
YEAH, I'D LIKE TO.

43:23.559 --> 43:25.977
I GOTTA GIVE BACK
HER SLATE AND PRIMER.

43:29.231 --> 43:31.441
I WISH YOU
DIDN'T HAVE TO GO.

43:31.609 --> 43:34.110
GOT TO.

43:34.278 --> 43:35.945
WISH I COULD BE HERE
FOR YOUR POEM,

43:36.113 --> 43:37.905
BUT I KNOW
YOU'LL DO GOOD.

43:38.073 --> 43:40.700
THANKS TO YOU.

43:40.868 --> 43:43.453
WHAT'S WRONG WITH PEOPLE,
SOLOMON?

43:43.621 --> 43:45.622
WHY CAN'T THEY CHANGE?

43:46.582 --> 43:48.416
MAYBE THEY WILL
SOMEDAY.

43:48.584 --> 43:49.917
MAYBE IN A HUNDRED
YEARS OR SO,

43:50.085 --> 43:52.003
THINGS WILL
BE DIFFERENT.

43:52.171 --> 43:54.005
MAYBE.

43:55.215 --> 43:56.591
Charles: HALF-PINT!

43:56.759 --> 43:58.426
