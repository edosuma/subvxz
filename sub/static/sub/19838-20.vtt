00:01.860 --> 00:03.200
<b>You didn't know?</b>

00:03.570 --> 00:10.480
<b>I'm saying that some unique humans 
are overflowing with life energy.</b>

00:10.960 --> 00:15.420
<b>They're hard to find, which is why they're rare.</b>

00:15.420 --> 00:16.740
<b>Rare?</b>

00:20.550 --> 00:22.300
<b><i>What trick is this?</i></b>

00:22.580 --> 00:25.090
<b><i>Suddenly, they feel far stronger.</i></b>

00:26.830 --> 00:28.080
<b><i>Thunderbolt!</i></b>

00:26.920 --> 00:28.420
<b>Thunderbolt</b>

00:32.690 --> 00:35.590
<b><i>First comes rock...</i></b>

00:37.640 --> 00:38.680
<b><i>Rock...</i></b>

00:39.150 --> 00:40.300
<b><i>Paper...</i></b>

00:41.080 --> 00:43.520
<b><i>Rock!</i></b>

00:45.750 --> 00:48.120
<b>If you wish to become stronger,</b>

00:48.120 --> 00:50.100
<b>this is a perfect opportunity.</b>

00:50.530 --> 00:54.230
<b>But if you aren't prepared, you won't 
be able to endure the ordeal.</b>

00:56.180 --> 00:57.580
<b>Whether we win or lose,</b>

00:58.810 --> 01:01.950
<b>hell lies ahead of us.</b>

02:21.990 --> 02:27.040
<b>Kite x And x Slots</b>

02:31.390 --> 02:33.610
<b>Kite, Gon, and Killua have advanced</b>

02:33.610 --> 02:38.570
<b>deep within NGL, in search 
of the Chimera Ant nest,</b>

02:38.570 --> 02:41.620
<b>and have arrived at a cliff 
with peculiar openings.</b>

02:42.520 --> 02:45.330
<b>This is the Chimera Ant nest?</b>

02:45.330 --> 02:46.630
<b>No.</b>

02:48.040 --> 02:50.990
<b>They don't make their nests in holes.</b>

02:51.400 --> 02:53.820
<b>They use mud and feces to build them.</b>

02:58.880 --> 02:59.940
<b>Let's go.</b>

03:00.300 --> 03:01.920
<b>You'll understand once we're inside.</b>

03:12.710 --> 03:16.120
<b>There's no telling when or 
from where they will attack.</b>

03:16.700 --> 03:18.240
<b>Be on your guard.</b>

03:19.080 --> 03:20.950
<b>Yeah, got it.</b>

03:21.570 --> 03:22.970
<b>That other Chimera Ant</b>

03:22.970 --> 03:24.930
<b>completely concealed his presence.</b>

03:30.000 --> 03:30.880
<b>Yeah.</b>

03:46.060 --> 03:47.240
<b>Let's go.</b>

04:01.110 --> 04:03.260
<b>Is this place...</b>

04:03.730 --> 04:08.030
<b>Yes, it is NGL's hidden side.</b>

04:08.540 --> 04:10.200
<b>A drug factory.</b>

04:10.200 --> 04:11.630
<b>Exactly.</b>

04:14.060 --> 04:17.290
<b>This factory produces the ingestible drug D²,</b>

04:18.180 --> 04:20.350
<b>which is spreading throughout the mainland.</b>

04:21.090 --> 04:23.900
<b>There are probably nearby bila trees, 
which produce its main ingredient.</b>

04:24.370 --> 04:26.890
<b>Ironic given their claims as preservationists.</b>

04:28.640 --> 04:30.280
<b>They're making more than drugs.</b>

04:30.880 --> 04:31.700
<b>Look.</b>

04:32.260 --> 04:34.420
<b>It's the same as the others.</b>

04:36.360 --> 04:42.100
<b>I assume that only the NGL leaders 
know the truth of this place.</b>

04:42.690 --> 04:44.430
<b>The other members</b>

04:44.430 --> 04:48.930
<b>joined because they honestly loved nature.</b>

04:49.580 --> 04:54.060
<b>So this facility is the center 
of NGL's underground.</b>

04:54.810 --> 04:56.940
<b>If it's empty...</b>

04:57.380 --> 05:01.870
<b>Then Chimera Ants have wiped 
out the NGL underground.</b>

05:02.460 --> 05:06.950
<b>And a bunch of amateurs with guns 
won't suffice to deal with them.</b>

05:07.570 --> 05:09.020
<b>What about their boss?</b>

05:09.410 --> 05:11.310
<b>He either escaped or was eaten.</b>

05:11.900 --> 05:13.830
<b>Either way, it's bad news.</b>

05:14.130 --> 05:15.920
<b>Huh? What do you mean?</b>

05:15.920 --> 05:16.690
<b>Shh!</b>

05:18.400 --> 05:19.590
<b>A few are around.</b>

05:29.260 --> 05:32.910
<b>They're slowly approaching 
through the middle tunnel.</b>

05:36.290 --> 05:38.440
<b>There are more in the left and right tunnels.</b>

05:39.460 --> 05:40.270
<b><i>En...</i></b>

05:41.530 --> 05:43.730
<b>How far away can you search?</b>

05:44.230 --> 05:46.370
<b>Everything within a forty-five meter radius.</b>

05:46.370 --> 05:48.630
<b>F-Forty-five meters?</b>

05:48.990 --> 05:53.740
<b>Depending on physical and mental condition, 
I can increase that by a few meters.</b>

05:54.470 --> 05:55.500
<b>Here they come.</b>

06:18.230 --> 06:20.110
<b>Keep it down, you two.</b>

06:26.360 --> 06:28.150
<b>Who are you guys?</b>

06:29.030 --> 06:32.160
<b>How dare you intrude on my turf?</b>

06:32.580 --> 06:35.500
<b>Help... Please help us!</b>

06:35.500 --> 06:37.470
<b>Stop talking, Spot!</b>

06:37.470 --> 06:39.580
<b>You're just a damned dog!</b>

06:43.390 --> 06:46.120
<b>Oops, didn't mean to do that.</b>

06:46.890 --> 06:48.490
<b>Oh, well.</b>

06:48.490 --> 06:50.680
<b>I'm getting bored with these guys.</b>

06:51.890 --> 06:53.750
<b>Guess I'll get rid of Rover, too.</b>

07:00.160 --> 07:04.720
<b>When you beg like that, 
I just want to kill you more.</b>

07:05.850 --> 07:07.190
<b>Stop!</b>

07:08.250 --> 07:09.320
<b>Kite...</b>

07:09.320 --> 07:10.820
<b>Don't move carelessly.</b>

07:11.530 --> 07:13.400
<b>There's more than one enemy.</b>

07:14.360 --> 07:16.330
<b>They want you to rush over.</b>

07:34.220 --> 07:36.080
<b>Bye-bye.</b>

07:36.670 --> 07:38.020
<b>H-Hel—</b>

07:40.020 --> 07:41.350
<b>Don't look away.</b>

07:41.660 --> 07:44.990
<b>If they shoot a projectile your way, 
you won't be able to see it.</b>

07:52.430 --> 07:53.670
<b>I've got it.</b>

07:54.230 --> 07:58.540
<b>You three will be my new dogs.</b>

08:00.370 --> 08:04.150
<b>Chimera Ants have always been aggressive,</b>

08:04.700 --> 08:09.130
<b>but it seems consuming malicious humans 
has made them even more evil.</b>

08:09.130 --> 08:11.200
<b>Huh? What do you mean?</b>

08:11.200 --> 08:12.760
<b>Phagogenesis.</b>

08:13.610 --> 08:18.780
<b>If we don't deal with them here, 
many more will die!</b>

08:24.180 --> 08:25.560
<b>Capture them!</b>

08:30.220 --> 08:32.200
<b>I'll take the one in back.</b>

08:32.670 --> 08:35.950
<b>You boys will have to deal 
with the two rushing us.</b>

08:35.950 --> 08:36.980
<b>Right!</b>

08:36.980 --> 08:37.660
<b>Got it.</b>

08:37.880 --> 08:39.360
<b>Do not hesitate.</b>

08:39.360 --> 08:40.790
<b>You must fight to kill.</b>

08:40.790 --> 08:41.780
<b>Bring it!</b>

09:03.050 --> 09:05.230
<b>Ha, take this.</b>

09:05.230 --> 09:07.900
<b>My unblockable Thousand Punches!</b>

09:27.310 --> 09:29.500
<b>That was close.</b>

09:29.500 --> 09:32.380
<b>You have more power than I expected.</b>

09:32.860 --> 09:35.790
<b><i>These guys are really tough.</i></b>

09:36.140 --> 09:39.890
<b><i>They have the hard shells of insects, 
combined with human agility...</i></b>

09:41.000 --> 09:43.890
<b>What's on your mind now?</b>

09:44.730 --> 09:45.640
<b><i>He's right.</i></b>

09:47.200 --> 09:49.140
<b><i>I can't hesitate!</i></b>

09:49.890 --> 09:52.570
<b><i>First comes rock...</i></b>

09:53.540 --> 09:54.430
<b>What?</b>

10:00.810 --> 10:05.250
<b>Little boy, do you want your new 
name to be Spot or Rover?</b>

10:07.230 --> 10:08.750
<b><i>Don't hesitate to kill.</i></b>

10:10.700 --> 10:14.810
<b>You'll be roving around the land of the 
dead in no time, so I'll call you Rover!</b>

10:15.240 --> 10:17.310
<b><i>Been a while since I flipped my switch on.</i></b>

10:22.910 --> 10:24.970
<b>Snake Awakens</b>

10:25.200 --> 10:26.230
<b>Damn you!</b>

10:31.210 --> 10:32.820
<b>Curse you!</b>

10:32.820 --> 10:34.210
<b>Take this!</b>

10:43.380 --> 10:44.840
<b>Fool!</b>

10:44.840 --> 10:47.120
<b>This is the poisonous one!</b>

10:48.740 --> 10:49.780
<b>Well?</b>

10:49.780 --> 10:53.440
<b>How does it feel as the poison 
spreads through your body?</b>

10:53.440 --> 10:54.780
<b>Does it feel good?</b>

10:58.190 --> 10:59.960
<b>Very effective.</b>

10:59.960 --> 11:04.510
<b>Once I drug him enough, 
we'll have a human dog.</b>

11:05.590 --> 11:07.020
<b>Are you done over there?</b>

11:07.860 --> 11:09.720
<b>Oh, not yet?</b>

11:17.510 --> 11:19.050
<b>How...</b>

11:20.380 --> 11:23.980
<b>My body is immune to poison.</b>

11:24.500 --> 11:26.890
<b>Ah, I see.</b>

11:27.370 --> 11:30.370
<b>If you behave, I'll kill you fast.</b>

11:30.910 --> 11:33.260
<b>Oh, well...</b>

11:33.260 --> 11:36.090
<b>It just means that I was weaker.</b>

11:44.610 --> 11:46.890
<b>She let that cheap act fool her.</b>

12:32.610 --> 12:36.660
<b><i>What is this power flowing from his body?</i></b>

12:37.070 --> 12:40.640
<b><i>Any closer, and I'll suffer considerable damage.</i></b>

12:41.600 --> 12:42.530
<b><i>But...</i></b>

12:43.280 --> 12:44.410
<b>What's wrong?</b>

12:44.890 --> 12:47.030
<b>Are you getting scared?</b>

12:48.080 --> 12:50.660
<b><i>If I don't attack, Yunju will kill me!</i></b>

12:51.790 --> 12:53.900
<b><i>The source of his power</i></b>

12:54.410 --> 12:55.500
<b><i>is his fist!</i></b>

12:56.150 --> 12:58.990
<b><i>He's preparing to launch an attack many...</i></b>

12:58.990 --> 13:02.680
<b><i>No, dozens of times stronger than the last.</i></b>

13:04.160 --> 13:07.170
<b><i>Or will he fake the punch and use a kick?</i></b>

13:07.170 --> 13:10.760
<b><i>No, he's definitely going to use his fist.</i></b>

13:11.180 --> 13:12.870
<b><i>Then I have no choice.</i></b>

13:12.870 --> 13:16.510
<b><i>I'll sacrifice my eight left 
legs to block his punch,</i></b>

13:16.510 --> 13:19.270
<b><i>while using the right eight to grab him.</i></b>

13:19.500 --> 13:22.650
<b><i>Then I can bite him and inject my venom!</i></b>

13:22.970 --> 13:25.380
<b><i>Let's run a simulation...</i></b>

13:39.080 --> 13:40.440
<b><i>This will work!</i></b>

13:40.440 --> 13:41.990
<b><i>It's just a punch.</i></b>

13:41.990 --> 13:44.330
<b><i>No matter how strong it is,</i></b>

13:44.330 --> 13:46.010
<b><i>if I'm prepared, I can take it!</i></b>

13:49.570 --> 13:53.250
<b>Hey, we should get started soon.</b>

13:53.250 --> 13:54.770
<b>Wait a little longer.</b>

13:55.120 --> 13:56.380
<b>Screw that!</b>

13:56.380 --> 13:58.900
<b>You don't have a choice in the matter.</b>

14:02.660 --> 14:05.400
<b>Now, entertain me.</b>

14:10.210 --> 14:11.570
<b>Very well...</b>

14:14.170 --> 14:15.660
<b><i>What...</i></b>

14:16.690 --> 14:19.620
<b>Why are you here?</b>

14:21.330 --> 14:23.440
<b>This is my castle.</b>

14:23.440 --> 14:25.980
<b>A king needs no reason to be in his castle.</b>

14:26.470 --> 14:29.650
<b>There are many drugs here 
that emit strong odors.</b>

14:30.100 --> 14:32.670
<b>I would expect you to avoid this place.</b>

14:33.370 --> 14:36.370
<b>Shut up... I like this place!</b>

14:38.160 --> 14:40.900
<b>What happened to the head of NGL?</b>

14:41.440 --> 14:43.140
<b>He would have been here.</b>

14:43.140 --> 14:44.340
<b>Beats me!</b>

14:44.730 --> 14:48.340
<b>He's probably inside the Queen's belly.</b>

14:50.900 --> 14:53.550
<b>I'm going to build my own kingdom starting here.</b>

14:53.550 --> 14:56.020
<b>Then I'll take control of the whole world.</b>

14:56.020 --> 15:00.640
<b>That will be impossible for a 
boor who amuses himself</b>

15:00.640 --> 15:02.420
<b>by making dogs of humans.</b>

15:03.720 --> 15:05.350
<b>Really now?</b>

15:05.350 --> 15:09.800
<b>I can't wait to strip you down and 
put a collar around your neck!</b>

15:17.150 --> 15:18.020
<b>Damn!</b>

15:39.300 --> 15:40.170
<b>Huh?</b>

15:43.130 --> 15:45.180
<b>Hey! Get down here!</b>

15:46.260 --> 15:49.510
<b>You only summon me when you're in trouble.</b>

15:49.510 --> 15:50.970
<b>You'd better watch it.</b>

15:51.250 --> 15:54.130
<b>I don't have time for small talk.</b>

15:54.130 --> 15:55.380
<b>Hurry it up.</b>

15:55.380 --> 15:56.890
<b>Oh, really?</b>

15:56.890 --> 15:58.220
<b>You're so impatient.</b>

16:00.420 --> 16:02.220
<b>Are you insulting me?</b>

16:02.220 --> 16:04.300
<b>Forget about turning you into a dog!</b>

16:04.300 --> 16:05.980
<b>I'm gonna kill you!</b>

16:05.980 --> 16:07.440
<b>4!</b>

16:07.440 --> 16:08.560
<b>Four, huh?</b>

16:08.560 --> 16:09.850
<b>Damn, bad spin.</b>

16:09.850 --> 16:11.070
<b>What was that?</b>

16:11.340 --> 16:14.640
<b>I have no bad spins, bastard!</b>

16:15.600 --> 16:17.920
<b>Die!</b>

16:41.540 --> 16:44.280
<b><i>I'll pretend to attack,</i></b>

16:44.280 --> 16:46.520
<b><i>while I block his punch.</i></b>

16:46.910 --> 16:49.620
<b><i>Then I grab him and bite.</i></b>

16:50.060 --> 16:51.190
<b><i>Here I go!</i></b>

16:54.060 --> 16:56.230
<b><i>Rock... Paper...</i></b>

16:56.230 --> 16:57.490
<b><i>Just as I thought!</i></b>

16:57.490 --> 16:58.660
<b><i>Block!</i></b>

16:59.110 --> 17:01.250
<b><i>Scissors!</i></b>

17:01.410 --> 17:02.410
<b>What?</b>

17:07.810 --> 17:10.420
<b><i>A-A sword?</i></b>

17:10.810 --> 17:11.940
<b><i>Impossible...</i></b>

17:11.940 --> 17:14.930
<b><i>Where was he hiding that?</i></b>

17:21.440 --> 17:23.840
<b><i>But this could be perfect.</i></b>

17:23.840 --> 17:25.870
<b><i>I can pretend I've been defeated,</i></b>

17:25.870 --> 17:28.900
<b><i>then wait for an opening to bite him!</i></b>

17:51.360 --> 17:53.840
<b>You can't relax after dismembering them.</b>

17:55.590 --> 17:58.330
<b>The head and body can survive</b>

17:58.330 --> 18:02.520
<b>an entire day after they've been separated.</b>

18:03.510 --> 18:06.480
<b>You must crush the head.</b>

18:06.860 --> 18:13.030
<b>And preferably, you'll kill 
them quickly and quietly.</b>

18:15.300 --> 18:17.270
<b>Oh, it's him!</b>

18:17.270 --> 18:19.110
<b>The thing that shot us.</b>

18:19.380 --> 18:21.180
<b>I got a slot machine in my mouth!</b>

18:21.180 --> 18:23.230
<b>It goes from 1 to 9.</b>

18:23.230 --> 18:25.350
<b>Each number summons a different weapon.</b>

18:25.350 --> 18:28.220
<b>This is my Crazy Slot!</b>

18:28.220 --> 18:30.390
<b>Don't forget the name!</b>

18:30.680 --> 18:32.140
<b>Just go away.</b>

18:34.240 --> 18:36.120
<b><i>That's a strange power...</i></b>

18:36.860 --> 18:38.400
<b>It talks by itself?</b>

18:38.790 --> 18:40.010
<b>Apparently.</b>

18:40.700 --> 18:42.620
<b>If it uses a slot machine,</b>

18:42.620 --> 18:45.270
<b>doesn't that mean you can't 
choose your weapon?</b>

18:45.270 --> 18:47.970
<b>Yes, and I cannot</b>

18:47.970 --> 18:53.440
<b>change or get rid of the 
weapon I receive until I use it.</b>

18:55.610 --> 18:57.790
<b>It's very aggravating.</b>

18:58.600 --> 18:59.890
<b>In that case...</b>

18:59.890 --> 19:02.030
<b>Why did you come up with this power?</b>

19:09.030 --> 19:12.040
<b>We've lost the signal from Yunju's team.</b>

19:12.650 --> 19:14.040
<b>Were they killed?</b>

19:15.550 --> 19:19.880
<b>The signal indicated three enemies,</b>

19:19.880 --> 19:24.430
<b>and that they looked tastier than the others.</b>

19:25.720 --> 19:28.160
<b>They must be rare humans.</b>

19:29.810 --> 19:32.060
<b>And we have cause to fight.</b>

19:32.710 --> 19:35.840
<b>Isn't Yunju using that factory as a base?</b>

19:35.840 --> 19:40.200
<b>So the rare humans should 
still be near the factory.</b>

19:40.660 --> 19:43.810
<b>Let's go! Tonight, we feast!</b>

19:43.810 --> 19:45.640
<b>Feast!</b>

19:48.100 --> 19:53.080
<b>Both of your powers are much 
easier to use than mine.</b>

19:53.390 --> 19:56.780
<b>Compared to that thing of yours? No kidding.</b>

19:56.780 --> 19:57.840
<b>Yeah.</b>

19:58.470 --> 20:02.890
<b>Gon, you appear to have incorporated 
Enhancer, Transmuter, and Emitter</b>

20:02.890 --> 20:05.720
<b>abilities into your Rock-Paper-Scissors.</b>

20:06.010 --> 20:10.730
<b>Yep, but my natural affinity 
lies with Enhancer abilities.</b>

20:11.140 --> 20:13.920
<b>Killua used lightning. 
Are you a Transmuter?</b>

20:13.920 --> 20:18.480
<b>Yeah, but it's not that strong, 
and I lose energy fast.</b>

20:19.190 --> 20:21.280
<b>You'll have the chance to improve.</b>

20:21.900 --> 20:22.990
<b>Let's hurry.</b>

20:23.650 --> 20:24.950
<b>The nest is close.</b>

20:43.180 --> 20:45.540
<b>I don't get it...</b>

20:47.920 --> 20:50.570
<b>I can feel power rushing into me.</b>

20:56.130 --> 21:00.480
<b>My body is overflowing with energy!</b>

21:02.660 --> 21:05.000
<b>What is this?!</b>

21:07.990 --> 21:09.040
<b>What's wrong?</b>

21:09.730 --> 21:11.480
<b>A signal from one of my soldiers.</b>

21:11.970 --> 21:14.290
<b>Rammot is acting strangely.</b>

21:14.290 --> 21:15.630
<b>Rammot?</b>

21:23.540 --> 21:24.860
<b>Well?</b>

21:25.210 --> 21:26.610
<b>Look at this!</b>

21:27.820 --> 21:30.660
<b>I feel reborn!</b>

21:34.850 --> 21:38.240
<b>Can you see that light, Peggy?</b>

21:40.660 --> 21:44.070
<b>What tremendous life energy...</b>

21:54.540 --> 21:59.110
<b>A Chimera Ant has finally 
discovered the power of <i>Nen</i>.</b>

23:25.890 --> 23:28.390
<b>Next time: Inspiration x To x Evolve.</b>

23:28.840 --> 23:30.590
<b>I want inspiration to evolve!</b>

23:30.590 --> 23:32.660
<b>When will you evolve?</b>

23:32.660 --> 23:33.960
<b>Now!</b>
