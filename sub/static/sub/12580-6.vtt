00:32.832 --> 00:36.427
So I got Nancy the frozen pig's heart
for Valentine's Day.

00:36.736 --> 00:39.296
But I can't decide
which is more romantic...

00:39.472 --> 00:42.168
that she finds it next to her pillow
in the morning...

00:42.275 --> 00:43.765
or the front seat of her car...

00:43.877 --> 00:46.641
so she can think of me
all the way to work.

00:46.913 --> 00:48.175
[horn honking]

00:48.281 --> 00:49.873
(Hank) The mail never comes this early.

00:49.983 --> 00:51.644
Talking about an old special delivery.

00:51.751 --> 00:54.948
You know what I'm saying, man?
Guaranteed overnight, too, man.

00:56.256 --> 00:59.316
Boy, Boomhauer's sure got a way
with the ladies.

00:59.459 --> 01:02.292
That poor bastard
has to celebrate Valentine's Day...

01:02.395 --> 01:04.795
a dozen times with a dozen women.

01:04.998 --> 01:09.230
Yeah. Poor Boomhauer,
running around like a fool.

01:09.769 --> 01:13.637
I could just cry for him.
I think I'll go do that.

01:17.177 --> 01:20.203
Hey, you're all dressed up.
You kids going to the dentist?

01:20.580 --> 01:22.741
Today's the Valentine's Day flower sale.

01:22.849 --> 01:25.511
If a girl likes you,
she buys you a carnation.

01:26.119 --> 01:30.613
It's just a scam perpetrated by
the floral industrial complex, right, Dad?

01:30.824 --> 01:32.451
That's right, Joseph.

01:32.559 --> 01:36.256
But still, you don't want to look
like some flowerless loser.

01:36.362 --> 01:37.420
What about me?

01:37.530 --> 01:41.728
Now that Connie and I broke up,
I could end up like Joseph last year.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.234
No offense, Joseph.

01:43.369 --> 01:45.394
I don't want to end up
like me last year, either.

01:45.505 --> 01:47.939
Bobby, you've got nothing to worry about.

01:48.041 --> 01:49.941
But if you don't have any flowers
by lunch...

01:50.043 --> 01:52.375
just start coughing
and go to the nurse's office.

01:52.479 --> 01:53.537
I'll pick you up.

01:53.713 --> 01:55.374
Hey, wait for me!

01:55.682 --> 01:56.876
[children chattering]

01:57.250 --> 02:01.448
Okay, even Acne Pete has a flower.
That's a good sign.

02:01.988 --> 02:04.684
-Hey, Bobby.
-Willa Harris.

02:04.791 --> 02:08.090
Call the principal. Someone's smoking.

02:08.193 --> 02:09.161
[chuckles]

02:13.133 --> 02:15.727
-Oh, thank God.
-Man, I'm dead.

02:18.171 --> 02:20.298
Happy Black History Month.

02:21.241 --> 02:24.039
I'm just kidding. Happy Valentine's Day.

02:24.410 --> 02:27.277
But FYl, it is Black History Month.

02:27.514 --> 02:29.345
Bobby, did you save me a spot?

02:29.449 --> 02:32.111
There's always gonna be a special place
in my heart...

02:32.218 --> 02:34.516
and on my shirt for you, Connie.

02:37.457 --> 02:39.516
You guys are so sophisticated.

02:39.626 --> 02:42.959
When Doug and Shannon broke up,
Shannon spit on his bike...

02:43.062 --> 02:45.724
and you know what he did
on her driveway.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.993
Oh, man, it's Charisse.

02:48.401 --> 02:51.268
She's so tall and her braces are so shiny.

02:51.604 --> 02:54.402
Do you think she caught me
sniffing her scrunchy that time?

02:54.507 --> 02:55.838
Hey, Bobby.

02:58.311 --> 02:59.642
Don't move.

03:01.648 --> 03:04.173
Yeah, like.... What?

03:04.284 --> 03:08.983
If you want to give Joseph a flower,
you better hurry while he still has room.

03:13.359 --> 03:16.260
A bunch of us are gonna
make fun of the janitor later.

03:16.362 --> 03:17.920
Bring something to throw.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.020
[sighing]

03:19.132 --> 03:20.326
Dude.

03:20.433 --> 03:23.800
You totally didn't have to do that for me,
and you totally did.

03:23.903 --> 03:25.495
You totally rock.

03:26.406 --> 03:28.033
That took courage.

03:31.044 --> 03:35.276
I haven't even hit my growth spurt yet,
and I'm already a stud.

03:35.515 --> 03:36.607
[laughing]

03:36.749 --> 03:38.580
Bobby the ladies' man.

03:38.818 --> 03:41.252
You know, your father and l
are going two-stepping tonight...

03:41.354 --> 03:43.151
to celebrate Valentine's Day.

03:43.256 --> 03:46.555
And because my little man
has been such a grown-up...

03:46.793 --> 03:47.760
no baby-sitter.

03:47.961 --> 03:48.985
Yes!

03:50.763 --> 03:51.821
[crickets chirping]

03:51.931 --> 03:52.955
Yep.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.126
Yep.

03:57.637 --> 04:01.038
Hey, Bill, you're not doing anything
tonight, are you?

04:01.174 --> 04:03.768
Great. We're leaving Bobby alone
for the first time.

04:03.876 --> 04:07.243
You think you could just check in on him,
make sure everything's okay?

04:07.347 --> 04:08.439
Can do!

04:08.548 --> 04:10.743
Bill, not now. In a while.

04:10.850 --> 04:15.219
And don't let him know we asked you,
even if it makes you feel important.

04:17.957 --> 04:18.981
[doorbell ringing]

04:19.125 --> 04:20.091
[knocking on door]

04:21.894 --> 04:24.727
Oh, Bobby, I didn't know you were home.

04:24.831 --> 04:29.734
I just stopped by to see if your dad
wanted to borrow my comb.

04:30.103 --> 04:33.539
He's not here. My folks went out
on their Valentine's date.

04:33.706 --> 04:37.972
Oh, that's sweet.
Valentine's Day is nice for couples.

04:38.244 --> 04:42.340
I haven't celebrated that particular holiday
since my wife left me.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.581
I'll tell my dad you stopped by.

04:46.252 --> 04:50.484
Are you in a hurry? Is Connie in there?
I don't hear anything.

04:50.590 --> 04:52.455
Did she fall and hit her head?

04:52.558 --> 04:55.618
Mr. Dauterive,
Connie and I broke up weeks ago.

04:56.162 --> 04:58.960
Oh, my God, that's terrible. Are you okay?

04:59.065 --> 05:01.829
Yeah, it's all cool. We're still friends.

05:02.101 --> 05:05.264
Friends. Yeah. I thought Lenore and l
would still be friends...

05:05.371 --> 05:07.669
but here I am, all alone.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.333
No one to have dinner with.

05:11.344 --> 05:12.333
[sighing]

05:12.445 --> 05:15.778
-I'll have dinner with you.
-You will? Great.

05:15.882 --> 05:19.340
I'll take you to the all-we-can-eat.
Let me go put on some sweatpants.

05:21.254 --> 05:22.380
[music playing]

05:22.555 --> 05:23.522
[people chattering]

05:23.756 --> 05:25.553
Thanks for joining me, Bobby.

05:25.658 --> 05:30.220
When I come here alone, they stick me
at the table behind the big-screen TV.

05:30.463 --> 05:32.658
Can I get you anything else?
Some dessert?

05:32.765 --> 05:34.096
More wings.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.935
At least if you're feeling full,
you're feeling something.

05:38.037 --> 05:40.505
I always thought
you drank and ate for fun.

05:40.606 --> 05:44.667
No, don't feel sorry for me.
Being alone's not all bad.

05:45.044 --> 05:47.512
You don't have to dress to impress.

05:47.680 --> 05:51.081
That frees up a lot of time,
which I fill with sleeping...

05:51.184 --> 05:53.652
because being awake is too depressing.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.188
But as a single guy yourself--

05:57.290 --> 06:00.919
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I am not single. I'm available.

06:01.094 --> 06:02.356
Available.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.054
Whatever gets you through the day.

06:05.164 --> 06:07.632
No, really.
You should've seen me at school today.

06:07.734 --> 06:10.498
I got so many flowers,
I gave myself a nickname.

06:10.603 --> 06:11.900
""Bobby Flowers.""

06:12.205 --> 06:14.264
I got flowers from a woman once.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.434
Turns out she was having
one of those contests with her friends...

06:17.543 --> 06:20.671
to see who could bring
the most pathetic guy to a party.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.872
They called it a Pig Dance. We won.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.883
I don't think
those girls are playing a trick on me.

06:26.986 --> 06:31.719
I mean, they were giggling a lot,
but that's because I'm funny, right?

06:31.824 --> 06:32.950
Wait. Stop right there.

06:33.059 --> 06:35.323
You could drive yourself crazy...

06:35.428 --> 06:39.091
trying to figure out all the reasons
women are laughing at you.

06:40.266 --> 06:41.358
[mumbling]

06:43.870 --> 06:44.928
[mumbling]

06:49.742 --> 06:50.868
[music playing]

06:51.310 --> 06:52.470
(Peggy) Look at those two.

06:52.578 --> 06:55.103
Trippy McLeftfoot
and his little gal, Clumsy.

06:55.214 --> 06:58.741
They have absolutely no rhythm.
And they think they can beat us?

06:58.851 --> 07:01.376
Oh, no. Not two years in a row.

07:01.487 --> 07:04.217
Aid daicers to the floor!

07:04.323 --> 07:07.952
Now remember, rock step, rock step,
glide step, windmill.

07:08.461 --> 07:10.793
Okay, let's do it. One and two and--

07:10.897 --> 07:14.230
-Clear the floor, you two.
-What? We're out?

07:14.333 --> 07:18.326
I refuse to acknowledge any tap
before you have seen us windmill.

07:20.206 --> 07:22.766
-Don't make me tap you again.
-It's not over!

07:22.875 --> 07:26.242
Hank, come on, windmill!
Come on, windmill! Windmill!

07:27.280 --> 07:28.338
[crickets chirping]

07:28.815 --> 07:30.612
Make yourself at home, Bobby.

07:30.716 --> 07:35.176
Take your shoes off, or leave them on
if you want to keep your socks clean.

07:37.890 --> 07:39.585
(priest) You may kiss the bride,

07:41.327 --> 07:43.318
I preseit Mr, aid Mrs,,,,

07:43.429 --> 07:45.727
My God! What happened to you?

07:45.865 --> 07:48.891
Yeah. I looked pretty good back then,
didn't l?

07:49.001 --> 07:51.868
Of course, that was
before Lenore started cheating on me.

07:51.971 --> 07:53.563
Two weeks before.

07:53.873 --> 07:54.840
[crying]

07:56.776 --> 08:01.406
Yeah, but can't you meet someone else,
like on the lnternet?

08:01.647 --> 08:04.377
-You can use your old picture.
-No, no, no.

08:04.484 --> 08:08.113
What are the odds of me
finding another beautiful, classy lady...

08:08.221 --> 08:11.418
passed out in my lap
at a Molly Hatchet concert?

08:11.524 --> 08:12.684
What about me?

08:12.792 --> 08:16.592
You think another pretty Asian girl
is gonna move in next door?

08:16.696 --> 08:19.358
No. You get one chance at love...

08:19.465 --> 08:23.026
and if you screw that up,
you're gonna be alone forever.

08:28.441 --> 08:29.806
(Bobby) What about this one?

08:29.909 --> 08:33.174
""Dear Bobby, I'll love you forever. Connie.""

08:33.880 --> 08:37.679
That was a lie.
I had a letter just like that from Lenore.

08:38.618 --> 08:41.587
I had to destroy it before it destroyed me.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.324
[exclaiming]

08:46.259 --> 08:50.161
When it rains, it pours.
Let's get you cleaned up and home.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.021
You'll probably want
to start sleeping soon.

08:55.034 --> 08:59.494
(Hank) We may not have won the contest,
but at least it was kind of romantic.

08:59.639 --> 09:02.199
You and me against the world and all.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.873
[Bobby and Bill sobbing]

09:06.045 --> 09:07.171
Bobby?

09:07.280 --> 09:09.214
Lenore!

09:10.216 --> 09:11.649
Connie!

09:12.285 --> 09:13.513
[both crying]

09:17.990 --> 09:22.188
Why are you moping about Connie?
You were just fine when it ended.

09:22.428 --> 09:25.226
If I remember correctly,
the breakup was mutual.

09:25.331 --> 09:27.595
It was the last thing we did together.

09:27.700 --> 09:31.192
-Bobby, you'll find someone else.
-Mr. Dauterive didn't.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.329
The only thing you need to know
about Bill Dauterive...

09:33.439 --> 09:34.770
is to stay away from him.

09:34.874 --> 09:37.274
Everything that man touches turns to...

09:37.376 --> 09:38.343
Bill.

09:39.645 --> 09:42.045
Can I sleep with you guys tonight?

09:42.315 --> 09:43.646
-Hank?
-No.

09:44.850 --> 09:45.817
[gulping]

09:47.253 --> 09:48.880
Bobby, it worked.

09:48.988 --> 09:52.219
I called Charisse,
and I was all, ""You want to go to a party?""

09:52.325 --> 09:55.351
And she was all, ""Okay.""
And I was all, ""Cool.""

09:55.494 --> 09:56.756
But inside I'm like....

09:56.862 --> 09:57.829
[exclaiming]

09:58.264 --> 09:59.754
So now I have to have a party.

09:59.865 --> 10:02.493
What do I wear? What do I serve?
What do I play?

10:02.602 --> 10:03.569
[burping]

10:03.769 --> 10:06.363
I can't believe I let Connie get away.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.873
If she would just love me again...

10:08.975 --> 10:12.376
I would build her a beautiful cage
and never let her out.

10:12.478 --> 10:13.536
Hey, guys.

10:13.646 --> 10:15.705
Would you sign a petition
to change our school name...

10:15.815 --> 10:19.216
from Tom Landry Middle School
to Tom Landry Learning Space?

10:19.318 --> 10:22.151
I'd do anything for you, Connie.

10:23.322 --> 10:24.414
Okay.

10:24.857 --> 10:29.453
Hey, Joseph's having a Valentine's party.
You wanna go?

10:29.762 --> 10:32.253
Well, the party is next door...

10:32.365 --> 10:36.062
and with all that noise,
I won't be able to study anyway, so, sure.

10:36.168 --> 10:41.037
Yes! We are back together.
Oh, baby, this feels so right.

10:41.273 --> 10:44.401
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Bobby, we're just friends.

10:44.510 --> 10:48.970
Pumpkin, don't use the F-word on me.
Not me.

10:49.281 --> 10:52.216
This is your cuddle monster talking.

10:52.318 --> 10:55.048
Hey, Leventhal.
Bobby and Connie back together.

10:55.154 --> 10:58.351
-Pass it on.
-Yeah. Well, I'm gonna go now.

10:59.225 --> 11:01.955
And we should probably
go to the party separately...

11:02.061 --> 11:03.392
and maybe at different times.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.862
Connie, don't leave me!

11:07.199 --> 11:09.599
Dude, is this what I do to chicks?

11:10.936 --> 11:12.198
[birds chirping]

11:13.139 --> 11:15.232
Hey, Bobby. How was school?

11:17.810 --> 11:21.405
We're out of Cool Whip? Oh, man!

11:22.615 --> 11:25.482
So, Dale tells me
Joseph's having a shindig.

11:25.718 --> 11:28.846
-You thinking of asking someone?
-I already asked Connie.

11:28.988 --> 11:31.149
She didn't want to have anything
to do with me.

11:31.257 --> 11:33.851
Okay, then she's dead to you.
It's time to move on.

11:33.959 --> 11:37.759
-ls there anyone else you like?
-I guess, Willa Harris.

11:38.097 --> 11:40.292
But I'm telling you, she's gonna say no.

11:40.399 --> 11:45.098
Say no to Bobby Hill and chocolates?
I do not think so.

11:45.304 --> 11:48.501
I have seen her go through
bake sale brownies like a wood chipper.

11:48.607 --> 11:51.337
You give her a call.
We'll give you some privacy.

11:54.914 --> 11:55.881
This could work.

11:55.981 --> 11:59.439
Willa Harris is so-so in the looks
and popularity departments.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.281
She will not say no.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.647
-Willa. That's a cute name.
-Hey, it's Bobby.

12:04.256 --> 12:07.919
I was just wondering if you'd be my date
to Joseph's party.

12:09.929 --> 12:11.419
[laughing]

12:11.530 --> 12:12.827
All right.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.057
Come on, it'll be fun. Please?

12:16.435 --> 12:19.268
Please, please, please, please.
Connie, don't hang up!

12:19.638 --> 12:22.801
I've got your favorite chocolates
right here, Assorted,

12:22.908 --> 12:24.933
The oies you love so much,

12:25.144 --> 12:26.736
Why cai 't you love me,,,

12:26.846 --> 12:29.440
the way you love
these assorted chocolates?

12:35.121 --> 12:36.986
I'm sweet on you, Connie.

12:37.189 --> 12:41.148
Connie, I'm your little candy man.

12:41.494 --> 12:42.461
[beeping]

12:44.430 --> 12:46.227
No!

12:50.102 --> 12:51.228
(girl) This will be really good. Come on.

12:51.337 --> 12:52.531
(boy) Yeah, come on, let's go.

12:52.638 --> 12:53.764
(girl #2) Thanks, Mom. See you later.

12:53.873 --> 12:58.742
Hey, Bobby. I gotta tell you,
you're not gonna find happiness in there.

12:58.844 --> 13:00.311
I've tried.

13:00.412 --> 13:04.041
I'm not supposed to talk to you,
Mr. Dauterive.

13:04.383 --> 13:08.285
My mom gave me this whistle
in case you start giving me advice.

13:12.424 --> 13:13.982
Check out Bobby.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.326
Connie.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.328
You still miss her, don't you?

13:19.465 --> 13:20.454
[sobbing]

13:20.566 --> 13:22.693
You know, my only regret with Lenore...

13:22.802 --> 13:27.000
is that I didn't make that one last
grand romantic gesture to win her back.

13:27.106 --> 13:30.633
-Wait. So maybe it's not too late for me?
-It's not.

13:30.743 --> 13:33.803
-Maybe I don't have to end up like you?
-You don't.

13:33.913 --> 13:35.210
All right!

13:37.383 --> 13:38.350
[groaning]

13:44.456 --> 13:46.083
[li Too Deep by Sum 41 playing]

13:47.226 --> 13:48.557
[children chattering]

13:49.495 --> 13:51.087
(boy) Someone took my soda!
Where's my soda?

13:51.197 --> 13:52.721
One time in math class...

13:52.832 --> 13:56.268
I chewed an eraser off my pencil
and threw it at the back of your head.

13:56.368 --> 13:58.336
-That was you?
-Yeah.

13:58.938 --> 13:59.905
Cool.

14:00.506 --> 14:01.564
Hey, Dad.

14:01.907 --> 14:02.896
[grunting]

14:03.108 --> 14:06.271
Not now, Joseph.
I'm rounding first base here.

14:07.780 --> 14:09.714
The moment's ruined.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.442
[crickets chirping]

14:14.620 --> 14:15.587
[doorbell ringing]

14:16.088 --> 14:19.080
Who wants to fall in love?

14:21.727 --> 14:24.696
Cupid is here. He's got one arrow left...

14:24.797 --> 14:28.927
and it's going straight into
Connie Souphanousinphone's heart.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.969
-Bobby sprouted wings.
-Oh, God!

14:32.605 --> 14:33.572
(Connie) Ow!

14:34.573 --> 14:36.541
You shot her in the eye.

14:36.809 --> 14:39.369
Oh, gross. You licked it.

14:42.147 --> 14:44.615
What are you doing?
You're ruining my party.

14:44.717 --> 14:48.517
What? You wouldn't even be having
this party if it wasn't for me.

14:48.654 --> 14:53.023
You'd just be sitting alone going,
""Dude, like.... I'm so....""

14:53.459 --> 14:54.585
Come on, get....

14:54.693 --> 14:57.389
Watch it. You're pulling off the wings.

14:57.796 --> 15:00.128
Let go. I'm not leaving.

15:00.232 --> 15:03.201
I am not leaving
unless Connie leaves with me.

15:04.136 --> 15:05.501
[Bobby groaning]

15:06.338 --> 15:07.305
[children grunting]

15:10.776 --> 15:12.107
[children cheering]

15:14.413 --> 15:15.539
Bobby!

15:18.684 --> 15:21.949
Well, Bobby,
it's better than wondering, ""what if....""

15:31.297 --> 15:32.423
[birds chirping]

15:37.569 --> 15:42.438
Hank, Bobby's been asleep for 15 hours.
We have to do something to cheer him up.

15:42.741 --> 15:45.972
So, I am taking his church shoes
to have taps put on them.

15:46.078 --> 15:49.844
That's just a Band-Aid, Peggy.
We need to find a cure.

15:50.215 --> 15:53.412
Then teach him, Hank.
Teach him to pitch woo.

15:53.519 --> 15:56.545
I don't know how to do that.
What did I do with you?

15:56.655 --> 15:59.249
Nothing. I did it all, as always.

16:06.999 --> 16:08.125
Bye.

16:10.669 --> 16:11.966
Boomhauer.

16:14.340 --> 16:19.073
Thanks, Boomhauer. Do whatever it takes.
Put gel in his hair if you have to.

16:24.249 --> 16:25.978
Hank, where's Bobby?

16:28.454 --> 16:29.421
[scatting]

16:29.688 --> 16:33.021
-I got mine done, too.
-Don't worry. Bobby's in good hands.

16:33.225 --> 16:35.785
Boomhauer's gonna fix everything
Bill broke.

16:35.894 --> 16:36.918
Boomhauer?

16:37.029 --> 16:39.896
Well, I try to shield you
from this kind of stuff, Peggy...

16:39.999 --> 16:42.627
but Boomhauer is pretty good
with the ladies...

16:42.735 --> 16:45.329
and he's agreed to show Bobby
some of his secrets.

16:45.437 --> 16:48.929
Hank, the man's longest relationship
was a three-day weekend.

16:49.041 --> 16:52.272
-What kind of secrets could he have?
-I don't know.

16:52.678 --> 16:55.306
-He wouldn't tell me.
-Well, he could be doing anything.

16:55.414 --> 16:58.781
He could be taking Bobby to a pickup bar.
Or a Hooters.

16:58.884 --> 17:01.045
-Oh, God.
-That's right, Hank.

17:05.023 --> 17:07.458
(Boomhauer) Ain't no worries, Little B.
We're gonna get you back on track.

17:07.559 --> 17:10.493
We gonna be talking about an old secret,
dang old strong enough for man...

17:10.596 --> 17:11.994
but that was made for woman, you know?

17:12.097 --> 17:14.895
There really is a secret to getting women?

17:16.435 --> 17:20.337
Please, I need to know. I won't tell anyone.
I swear. I swear.

17:20.472 --> 17:22.337
Hey, man,
there ain't no jokes about here, man.

17:22.441 --> 17:24.704
I'm talking about,
you're gonna take a solemn oath, man.

17:24.810 --> 17:27.643
-Talking about that old Bibbly-B.
-l, Bobby Hill...

17:27.746 --> 17:30.874
Now I'm gonna cross my dang old heart,
talking about, I pledge allegiance...

17:30.983 --> 17:33.918
-tell you what, man.
-...do solemnly swear....

17:34.253 --> 17:36.278
(Peggy) We should have given
Bobby a pager.

17:36.388 --> 17:38.049
He might have become a drug dealer...

17:38.157 --> 17:40.455
but at least
we would always know where he is.

17:43.996 --> 17:47.159
Come on, man, you just talking about
an old, dang old fishing magician, man.

17:47.266 --> 17:48.290
Talking about a dang old....

17:49.101 --> 17:50.830
What are we doing at Shelwyn's?

17:50.936 --> 17:53.404
I thought you were gonna
show me your lady secrets.

17:57.810 --> 17:58.970
Mmm-hmm.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.006
[women chattering]

18:03.415 --> 18:06.942
Hey, man, you just watch old B-Dog,
and you'll learn, man.

18:07.286 --> 18:10.881
Hey, pretty lady, why don't you talk about
how I'm maybe gonna call you sometime?

18:10.989 --> 18:12.854
Yeah, I don't think so.

18:13.258 --> 18:17.160
Hey there, pretty lady, talking about
I might give you a call sometime, man.

18:17.262 --> 18:18.593
Oh, please.

18:22.534 --> 18:24.434
Hey, baby,
you know what I'm talking about.

18:24.536 --> 18:27.505
You look good on your feet,
but you're gonna look better on my bed.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.665
I'm talking
about giving me them digits, man.

18:29.775 --> 18:33.040
Why don't you go home
and take another cologne bath?

18:33.679 --> 18:36.648
You just got blown off three times.

18:36.915 --> 18:38.109
Yeah, so?

18:41.253 --> 18:42.982
It doesn't fit.

18:43.088 --> 18:46.580
Yeah, man, and maybe I'm gonna
show you something in old size Boom.

18:46.692 --> 18:49.786
You don't work here.
Get away from my feet.

19:04.443 --> 19:08.937
Hey, that's Boomhauer's car. Yep.
He always takes two spots.

19:12.751 --> 19:13.809
Yeah, man. Check it out, man.

19:13.919 --> 19:16.786
She went and entered
in my dang old PalmPilot.

19:21.660 --> 19:25.255
But you got shot down by 23 women...

19:25.364 --> 19:26.922
before you got that phone number.

19:27.266 --> 19:28.426
It ain't no thing.

19:28.534 --> 19:30.934
So this is your big secret?

19:31.036 --> 19:35.336
You just ask every woman you see
until one of them finally says yes?

19:35.641 --> 19:38.269
Man, you're gonna tell my....
My old secret, man.

19:42.781 --> 19:44.942
You know what, Mr. Boomhauer?

19:45.050 --> 19:48.816
I'm pretty sure this is not the way
I'm gonna find real love.

19:49.521 --> 19:52.979
[laughing] Man, what you talking about,
dang old ""love""?

19:58.597 --> 19:59.757
[music playing]

20:02.334 --> 20:05.462
Well, I guess Boomhauer's secret
isn't in housewares.

20:05.571 --> 20:07.163
And it's not in the portrait studio...

20:07.272 --> 20:10.036
although I did see a very ugly baby there.

20:13.812 --> 20:15.712
This place is so boring.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.177
What's wrong with you?

20:18.717 --> 20:20.014
Where do I start?

20:20.118 --> 20:22.552
You could start
with the shoehorn on your nose.

20:22.654 --> 20:25.782
You know, I honestly forgot
I still had it there.

20:26.592 --> 20:30.619
Are you laughing at me, or....
Who cares? I'll take it.

20:31.463 --> 20:33.226
-I'm Bobby.
-Debby.

20:33.599 --> 20:36.500
Debbie with an ""i-e"" or Debby with a ""y""?

20:36.735 --> 20:40.865
-""Y.""
-""Y"" with a ""y"" or with a ""w-h-y""?

20:41.206 --> 20:42.366
[laughing]

20:45.577 --> 20:48.478
-There he is.
-lt is always the last place you look.

20:48.580 --> 20:51.572
Because after that,
there's no reason to keep looking.

20:52.517 --> 20:54.678
What are you guys doing here?

20:56.188 --> 20:57.780
We.... Buying shoes.

20:58.290 --> 21:01.225
Excuse me,
do you have these in a size 16-and-a-half?

21:01.460 --> 21:02.427
[laughing]

21:02.694 --> 21:04.525
Your mom's funny, too.

21:05.530 --> 21:09.057
Hey, you wanna go wear hats
and pretend we're mannequins?

21:09.201 --> 21:10.259
Okay.

21:12.738 --> 21:14.399
Hey, Hank, Peggy, man. How you doing?

21:14.506 --> 21:16.565
I'm at this store here
buying shoes for my mom, man.

21:16.675 --> 21:19.075
I'm gonna.... You know,
Mother's Day coming up, you know?

21:19.177 --> 21:21.645
She look lovely in Jimmy Choo,
you know, man?

21:21.747 --> 21:23.271
Look at my boy.

21:38.764 --> 21:39.822
(Hank) Whoa, Boomhauer.

21:39.931 --> 21:42.991
That's the women's changing room.
The men's is over there.

21:43.402 --> 21:45.336
God dang it all, man!

21:46.138 --> 21:49.539
Don't mention it.
I owed you for fixing up my boy.

22:27.946 --> 22:30.506
(Bobby) I'm your little caidy mai,
