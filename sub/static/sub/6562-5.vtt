04:18.592 --> 04:21.295
NEW RESEARCH SHOWS THAT
THE MONSTER BAND IS DEAD.

04:21.329 --> 04:22.630
- OOH!

04:22.663 --> 04:25.466

THAT'S POPPING IS KENDALL,

04:25.499 --> 04:27.901
BECAUSE HE LOOKS NORMAL
ON THE ALBUM COVER.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.770

A FULL MOON,

04:29.803 --> 04:31.772
THEN HE'S A SHAG CARPET

04:31.805 --> 04:33.441
- WELL,

- I'M MUFFY.
I'M NOT INTERESTED.

05:51.519 --> 05:52.853

I LIKE LONG WALKS ON THE BEACH

05:54.755 --> 05:59.393
