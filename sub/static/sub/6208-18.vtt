00:05.238 --> 00:08.807
<i>Those fingers in my head</i>

00:08.808 --> 00:12.678
<i>That sly, come-hither stare</i>

00:12.679 --> 00:15.514
<i>That strips my conscience bare</i>

00:15.515 --> 00:17.950
<i>It's witchcraft</i>

00:18.803 --> 00:21.220
- Salem, did I hear you singing?
- No, I was just...

00:21.221 --> 00:23.422
It's okay.
I came in 'cause it sounded good.

00:23.423 --> 00:26.025
Oh come on, enough. Ya think?

00:26.026 --> 00:28.293
Yeah. I just wanted a front row seat.

00:28.294 --> 00:30.496
- Me too.
- Right behind you.

00:30.497 --> 00:32.164
Well, well, well.
Ol' yellow eyes,

00:32.165 --> 00:33.399
you've still got it.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.433
Hit it cat.

00:34.634 --> 00:38.329
<i>And I've got
no defense for it</i>

00:38.338 --> 00:41.907
<i>The heat is too
intense for it</i>

00:42.208 --> 00:46.278
<i>What good would common sense
For it do...</i>

00:48.181 --> 00:49.493
Hairball!

00:51.217 --> 00:52.217
Hairball!

01:16.276 --> 01:17.776
It's an interesting theory Jenny

01:17.777 --> 01:20.079
but I don't think there's a force
field around this table.

01:20.080 --> 01:23.315
Then why isn't anyone signing up
to adopt a Grandparent?

01:23.316 --> 01:25.754
Do you think it's clear that these
adoptions are not legally binding?

01:26.853 --> 01:29.121
- Hi guys.
- Libby.

01:29.122 --> 01:31.557
can I sign you up for the
Adopt-a-Grandparent programme?

01:31.558 --> 01:32.891
Actually I came over here to tell you guys

01:32.892 --> 01:34.727
about my new community service,

01:34.728 --> 01:37.830
it's the Adopt-a-life programme.
May I sign you up?

01:37.831 --> 01:39.565
Don't answer, it's a trick question.

01:39.566 --> 01:40.855
See ya freak,

01:41.368 --> 01:42.701
Frizzy freak.

01:42.702 --> 01:44.970
Frizzy! These happen to be curls!

01:44.971 --> 01:47.639
Let it go Jenny, take the high road.

01:51.044 --> 01:52.444
What's going on?

01:52.445 --> 01:54.980
Some foreign exchange
students are sitting at our table.

01:54.981 --> 01:56.248
Deport them.

01:57.480 --> 01:58.750
What's with your socks,

01:58.751 --> 02:00.452
did you get dressed in the dark this morning?

02:00.453 --> 02:02.354
No, I...

02:02.355 --> 02:03.522
How did this happen?

02:04.591 --> 02:06.125
Quick, switch socks with each other.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.793
- What!
- I need a trend

02:07.794 --> 02:09.728
and I need it now.

02:09.729 --> 02:12.364
Hey Harvey, over here.
We need you to sign up.

02:12.365 --> 02:13.666
I did, on my way in.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.601
Yes but nobody else has,
so could you do it again

02:15.602 --> 02:16.602
and do it loudly?

02:16.603 --> 02:18.037
All right.

02:18.038 --> 02:20.205
Sure, I'd love to adopt a Grandparent.

02:20.206 --> 02:21.907
Old people are so much fun,

02:21.908 --> 02:23.242
they know tones of stuff...

02:23.243 --> 02:24.877
and sometimes they give you money

02:25.879 --> 02:28.480
Shhhh! Don't go there!

02:28.481 --> 02:31.016
Well at least we've filled
the sign up sheet.

02:31.017 --> 02:32.885
Yeah, but it's all Harvey and...

02:32.886 --> 02:34.753
Mighty Mouse!

02:34.754 --> 02:36.722
So then my dance instructor said...

02:36.723 --> 02:38.390
Hey! Look at her.

02:38.391 --> 02:40.426
She matches.

02:44.297 --> 02:46.131
- What ya making?
- Hair soup.

02:46.132 --> 02:48.667
I thought long tresses would
look nice for a change.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.004
Hmm, it tastes really wavy.

02:52.205 --> 02:53.238
Sorry I'm late.

02:53.239 --> 02:55.140
It took longer at the book
store than I expected.

02:55.141 --> 02:57.743
- Did you get me 'Cat Fancy'?
- Yes.

02:57.744 --> 02:59.411
And Salem, here's your 'New Republic'

02:59.412 --> 03:00.412
Thanks.

03:00.413 --> 03:01.547
I hate the politics

03:01.548 --> 03:04.316
but Brustien on the
theatre is a revaluation.

03:04.517 --> 03:06.085
Why do you keep smiling?

03:06.086 --> 03:08.020
- I do not.
- Yes you do.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.055
- Do not.
- Fine, don't tell me.

03:10.056 --> 03:11.590
I can always twist your arm.

03:12.309 --> 03:14.860
Aw! Cut it out! Oh you!

03:15.634 --> 03:16.962
Aw! You're pulling my ear!

03:16.963 --> 03:17.996
Let go of my arm!

03:17.997 --> 03:19.064
Let go of my ear!

03:19.065 --> 03:20.065
Enough okay, I'll tell you.

03:22.502 --> 03:24.903
I met a guy at the book store.

03:24.904 --> 03:26.905
Oh really? What was his pick up line?

03:26.906 --> 03:28.474
He didn't have one.

03:28.475 --> 03:29.942
He mistook me for an employee

03:29.943 --> 03:31.243
and asked me if we carried any books

03:31.244 --> 03:32.845
on how to meet intelligent women.

03:33.947 --> 03:35.214
Do you think you'll see him again?

03:35.215 --> 03:36.815
He took my number

03:36.816 --> 03:38.283
but it wasn't a pick up.

03:39.252 --> 03:40.452
Soups on!

03:40.453 --> 03:42.488
- D'ya want some?
- Just a smidgen bowl.

03:42.489 --> 03:44.523
How about you Zelda? It's hair soup.

03:44.524 --> 03:46.025
No thanks, I just got mine cut.

03:46.789 --> 03:48.260
I'll get it!

03:49.095 --> 03:50.162
Hello?

03:50.163 --> 03:53.399
Oh yuck, there's a hair in my hair soup.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.634
Of course I remember you, Rick.

03:58.538 --> 04:00.806
No, I'm still here.

04:00.807 --> 04:03.308
- What's she smiling about?
- A boy.

04:03.309 --> 04:06.979
Hold on Rick,
I'm going to grab the cordless.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.247
You were saying?

04:08.248 --> 04:09.314
D'you want some hair soup?

04:09.315 --> 04:11.050
It's really thick and luxurious.

04:11.051 --> 04:13.218
No thanks, I'm on my way
to the Senior Center

04:13.219 --> 04:14.753
but I should probably bring them something.

04:16.322 --> 04:19.358
Chewy caramels,
that's perfect.

04:20.125 --> 04:21.192
This is already better

04:21.194 --> 04:23.095
than visiting my real Grandparents,

04:23.096 --> 04:24.830
I don't have to take my ear rings out.

04:29.035 --> 04:30.869
How do we know which one to chose?

04:30.870 --> 04:31.970
I see mine.

04:31.971 --> 04:33.972
I see mine.

04:35.975 --> 04:37.976
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:37.977 --> 04:39.378
This is kind of awkward

04:39.379 --> 04:41.046
but would you like to be my Grandmother?

04:41.783 --> 04:43.949
Of course, that'd be lovely.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.251
But before I start bragging about you

04:46.252 --> 04:47.920
I need to know your name.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.955
I'm Sabrina, and what's yours?

04:49.956 --> 04:51.557
- You can call me Nana.
- Great.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.462
An awkward silence,

04:56.463 --> 04:58.430
it's like we really are family.

04:58.431 --> 05:01.600
Here, how about looking at my scrap book?

05:03.737 --> 05:06.138
Wow! Awesome photo of Elija Wood.

05:06.661 --> 05:08.007
Oh he's my little honey.

05:08.008 --> 05:10.976
- You know him?
- Noah Wyle introduced us.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.478
You know Noah Whyle!

05:12.479 --> 05:14.179
Only through Christian Slater.

05:14.180 --> 05:16.749
I love Christian Slater.
How do you know these people?

05:16.750 --> 05:19.952
Well when you get to be my age
you know just about everybody.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.454
Howard.

05:22.455 --> 05:24.323
Did you come to adopt a Grandparent?

05:24.324 --> 05:26.458
No. I'm here to take
a photo for the school paper.

05:26.459 --> 05:28.260
We're doing an article
on community service,

05:28.261 --> 05:30.629
it's called 'Westbridge Cares'

05:30.630 --> 05:32.931
But apperantly not that much.

05:32.932 --> 05:34.400
I'll go set up.

05:34.401 --> 05:35.734
Excellent timing.

05:35.735 --> 05:37.803
A photo will be great publicity
for the programme.

05:38.004 --> 05:41.096
Yeah, I only wish we could have
got'n someone cool to be here.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.509
- Thanks a lot!
- You know what I mean,

05:43.510 --> 05:45.144
someone others follow.

05:45.145 --> 05:47.946
Like Libby the lord high
empress of  Westbridge?

05:47.947 --> 05:49.782
I thought she was sophomore class president?

05:49.783 --> 05:51.984
Libby would never show her face here.

05:51.985 --> 05:53.452
Maybe we could fake it.

05:53.453 --> 05:56.188
My dad says that  Russia's
on their third Boris Yeltzin.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.623
Oh come on, you can't fake a person.

05:59.492 --> 06:01.060
Of course you can't!

06:01.061 --> 06:03.128
Gotta go.

06:07.534 --> 06:10.135
This is the worst thing
I've ever  had to do.

06:25.518 --> 06:28.354
- Alright, I'm here.
- Libby.

06:28.355 --> 06:30.055
What are you doing at the Senior Center?

06:30.256 --> 06:32.591
I thought I'd drop by
and improve your image.

06:32.592 --> 06:33.792
You're gonna help us?

06:33.793 --> 06:37.680
Look, I know I'm completely
shallow and self  absorbed

06:37.831 --> 06:40.666
but every now and then I think of others.

06:40.467 --> 06:43.202
All set. If you could stand together.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.436
No problem.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.039
How's this?

06:47.040 --> 06:49.108
- You mean next to you!
- Sure.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.175
Smile.

06:51.945 --> 06:54.713
Now put that on the
front page  and remember,

06:54.714 --> 06:56.415
old people are the coolest.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.883
You can  quote me on that.

06:57.884 --> 06:59.385
I will, thanks Libby.

06:59.386 --> 07:00.452
What a scoop.

07:01.821 --> 07:03.122
Now that the reporters gone

07:03.123 --> 07:04.289
I guess I'll go too.

07:04.290 --> 07:05.357
Bye.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.996
Did you see that? Libby
treated me like a  human.

07:10.997 --> 07:12.297
I'm glad we took a picture because

07:12.298 --> 07:14.366
Sabrina's  gonna think we pulled a Yeltzin.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.535
Hey, what's up?

07:16.536 --> 07:17.903
Libby was just here.

07:17.904 --> 07:19.972
No?

07:19.973 --> 07:22.741
Well that aughta get kids involved.

07:23.706 --> 07:26.779
Sabrina look, the Senior Center
photo made the  front page.

07:27.005 --> 07:29.281
Cool! Has Libby seen this?

07:30.717 --> 07:32.017
What is this?

07:32.018 --> 07:34.386
A photo of you standing next to Jenny.

07:34.387 --> 07:37.089
Oh, I would not.
This is a fake,

07:37.090 --> 07:40.159
they must have  put my
face on someone else's body.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.061
And not a very  good one.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.763
Then it quotes you as saying
'Old people are  the coolest'

07:44.764 --> 07:46.865
No, cheerleaders are the coolest.

07:48.127 --> 07:49.368
Harvey, you were at the Senior Center.

07:49.369 --> 07:50.869
You didn't see me there right?

07:50.970 --> 07:53.372
Libby, you did a good thing. Deal with it.

07:53.373 --> 07:55.407
I've been framed.

07:59.112 --> 08:01.080
What's with her?
How can she not  remember?

08:01.081 --> 08:02.481
Isn't it obvious?

08:02.482 --> 08:03.982
Libby has multiple  personalities

08:03.983 --> 08:05.451
and we finally met the nice one.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.288
And today we are going to be studying sight

08:09.289 --> 08:11.824
and there's more to this
subject than meets the eye.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.692
- Mr. Pool!
- Er yeah?

08:13.693 --> 08:16.338
Before you begin I'd like to make
an announcement to the class

08:16.383 --> 08:18.364
regarding the front page
of the school newspaper.

08:18.365 --> 08:20.065
Oh, y'know what?
I noticed that myself

08:20.066 --> 08:23.102
and may I say I was
proud to have all three

08:23.103 --> 08:25.237
outstanding citizens in my class.

08:25.238 --> 08:27.106
Libby, Harvey, Jenny,

08:27.107 --> 08:29.375
you are the hope of America.

08:29.376 --> 08:31.377
Now let's hear it for these
everyday hero's, huh?

08:34.114 --> 08:35.748
Now er what was it you
wanted to say Libby?

08:35.749 --> 08:37.649
Nothing.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.385
Ah, we'll be at the Senior
Center again today

08:39.385 --> 08:41.020
if anyone else wants to join us.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.356
Us? I don't recall
seeing you there Sabrina.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.695
Hey!

08:49.696 --> 08:51.130
Hi.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.065
I see the hair spell kicked in.

08:53.066 --> 08:55.534
I probably shouldn't have had
that second bowl of hair soup

08:55.535 --> 08:58.671
but I thought mutton chops
would be nice for a change.

08:58.672 --> 09:01.206
You look like Greg Allman.

09:01.207 --> 09:02.841
I'll take that as a compliment.

09:02.842 --> 09:04.543
So how was your date with Rick?

09:04.544 --> 09:07.212
Oh, not so good.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.747
I'm starting to feel really weird

09:08.748 --> 09:10.349
about the age difference.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.384
I mean normally I don't
care about these things

09:12.385 --> 09:15.788
but Rick keeps bringing up
stuff that makes me feel old.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.890
- Like what?
- Oh he keeps talking

09:17.891 --> 09:20.192
about how he can't wait
for the turn of the century.

09:20.193 --> 09:22.594
Big deal, I've done
that five times.

09:22.595 --> 09:23.929
Oh, and it's always the same.

09:23.930 --> 09:28.133
I've partied like it was sixteen ninety-nine,
seventeen ninety-nine, eighteen ninety-nine,

09:28.134 --> 09:29.668
this time I'm staying home.

09:29.669 --> 09:31.437
Exactly.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.439
I think I'm going to brake off our relationship.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.140
Oh you haven't even given him a chance.

09:35.141 --> 09:36.442
You grow a little facial hair

09:36.443 --> 09:37.976
and suddenly you're on his side.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.045
Hey look at me,

09:40.046 --> 09:42.881
I'm a hippie cat.

09:42.882 --> 09:45.651
Try some fudge,
Pete Sampras sent it to me.

09:45.652 --> 09:47.853
And who sent you the turtles?
Chris O'Donnell?

09:47.854 --> 09:49.388
No.

09:49.389 --> 09:50.789
Leonardo DiCaprio.

09:51.858 --> 09:53.525
Mmm! Then I'll have one of these.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.694
Oh, excuse me I'll be right back.

09:55.695 --> 09:57.229
Hey guys, where are you going?

09:57.230 --> 09:59.131
You've gotta pick out a
grandparent while they last.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.834
No thanks. We only came because
we thought Libby would be here.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.469
And she's not, so we're going.

10:03.470 --> 10:05.504
But you can't go,
we need people and

10:05.505 --> 10:07.473
maybe Libby'll come.

10:07.474 --> 10:09.341
In fact I'm sure Libby'll come.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.377
Oh, I think I see her in the hall now.

10:13.980 --> 10:16.081
Oh man, not again.

10:20.453 --> 10:23.088
Oh, stupid Libby!

10:24.924 --> 10:26.091
Hi guys.

10:26.092 --> 10:27.259
- Libby!
- You made it!

10:27.260 --> 10:29.101
Sabrina told me you were
thinking of taking off?

10:29.129 --> 10:30.141
No!

10:30.321 --> 10:31.515
Old people are the coolest.

10:31.550 --> 10:33.866
You got that right.
Oh hey, there's Jenny.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.569
Hi Jenny,
how's it going?

10:37.570 --> 10:39.338
Good.

10:42.842 --> 10:44.843
Nana,

10:44.844 --> 10:46.612
Sabrina had to run out for a minute

10:46.613 --> 10:48.113
so she asked me to take over.

10:48.114 --> 10:49.181
I'm Libby.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.817
A pleasure to meet you. Turtle?

10:51.818 --> 10:54.286
Mr. Berry, are you sure
you want to do that?

10:54.287 --> 10:56.188
I admit leaving my king unprotected

10:56.189 --> 10:57.790
is a somewhat risky strategy

10:57.791 --> 10:59.892
but er, I think I know what I'm doing.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.827
You beat me ten times in a row,

11:01.828 --> 11:03.062
I'm not going to argue with you.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.032
Hey, checkmate!

11:07.033 --> 11:08.534
How about that?

11:08.535 --> 11:10.448
It's time for a victory soda.

11:10.483 --> 11:11.503
Libby!

11:13.073 --> 11:14.080
Yeah Harvey?

11:14.389 --> 11:16.302
Can I... get you a soda?

11:16.337 --> 11:18.944
Sure, I'd love a Ginger-Ale.

11:25.051 --> 11:26.952
Harvey.

11:26.953 --> 11:28.487
You must have been super-thirsty

11:28.488 --> 11:30.823
if you couldn't wait for me to
bring it back. Here you go.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.858
- What's this?
- It's your soda.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.093
Ginger-Ale,

11:34.094 --> 11:35.461
what kind of freak drink is that?

11:35.462 --> 11:36.495
I only drink diet.

11:36.496 --> 11:37.996
But you asked for this.

11:37.997 --> 11:41.000
No I didn't.
Now move, I'll get my own soda.

11:41.001 --> 11:43.535
Y'know, I think I liked your
other personality better...

11:43.536 --> 11:45.070
Even if she does pick her nose.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.207
Here, I've got another soda,
do you want it?

11:48.208 --> 11:50.075
I never turn down a free drink.

11:52.779 --> 11:54.947
Harvey, where's my soda?

11:54.948 --> 11:57.282
You said you didn't want it.

11:57.283 --> 11:58.417
When?

11:58.418 --> 12:00.219
You called it a freak drink.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.421
I would not!.....

12:02.422 --> 12:06.091
Yes I would. Gotta go.

12:09.722 --> 12:11.577
Urgh! Stupid old peoples soda machine!

12:20.573 --> 12:22.408
Sorry sir, I need the phone.

12:22.409 --> 12:25.310
If you have a problem with that
my name is Libby. Shut the door!

12:28.648 --> 12:30.182
Finally!

12:30.183 --> 12:31.617
Hi Libby, you made it.

12:31.618 --> 12:33.452
This stupid machine gave me Ginger-Ale.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.988
- I wont drink this.
- I will. Thanks.

12:42.362 --> 12:43.762
All right, I'm here!

12:43.763 --> 12:45.297
Isn't anyone gonna say hi?

12:45.298 --> 12:47.333
- We already did.
- When you first came in.

12:47.334 --> 12:48.867
I did just come in.

12:48.868 --> 12:50.736
This isn't funny anymore.

12:52.038 --> 12:53.806
And what are you doing with that old lady?

12:53.807 --> 12:55.174
That's the way the programme works.

12:55.175 --> 12:57.309
You select a grandparent and
spend some time with them.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.411
- What's the catch?
- There isn't a catch,

12:59.412 --> 13:01.780
ou get the satisfaction of doing
something nice for someone.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.516
Libby. Libby.

13:04.517 --> 13:07.386
I guess I'll go with her since she
already seems to know me.

13:09.622 --> 13:12.591
Isn't it great. Look,
everyone has someone.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.626
I know, it's working better
than I ever imagined.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.229
- And it's all thanks to Libby.
- Libby?

13:17.230 --> 13:20.366
You know, deep down
she's a really good person.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.301
I wouldn't go that far. I mean,

13:22.302 --> 13:24.603
I'm sure Libby can be nice
on rare occasions when

13:24.604 --> 13:26.071
I'm not around

13:26.072 --> 13:28.841
but most of the time Libby's just... Libby.

13:28.842 --> 13:30.576
Oh Sabrina, if only you could have seen

13:30.577 --> 13:32.260
the way she waved at me.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.347
But I did, it was like this.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.916
You are not!

13:37.917 --> 13:40.619
I'm the worlds biggest Johnny Depp fan.

13:40.620 --> 13:41.706
Hey, what's up?

13:43.056 --> 13:44.189
May we help you?

13:44.190 --> 13:45.724
I just wanted to talk to Nana.

13:46.428 --> 13:48.427
Oh I'm afraid that's impossible.

13:49.462 --> 13:51.363
She's my Nana now.

14:01.007 --> 14:03.375
- Aunt Hilda, have you got a sec?
- Yeah.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.844
I have a problem.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.146
I'm yours,

14:07.147 --> 14:09.415
I always have time for girl talk.

14:09.416 --> 14:12.284
This isn't about boys,
this is about Libby.

14:12.285 --> 14:13.752
Is she being mean again?

14:13.753 --> 14:16.822
No, she's being nice
but it's just as bad.

14:16.823 --> 14:20.192
You see, Jenny and I started this
adopt-a-Grandparent programme.

14:21.227 --> 14:22.461
And then Libby got involved

14:22.462 --> 14:24.063
and now she's queen of the Senior Center.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.597
Why does she always have to win?

14:25.598 --> 14:27.866
Sabrina, charities not a contest.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.602
It sounds like when Libby wins,
everybody wins.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.004
Not me, I lost!

14:32.005 --> 14:34.373
She stole my adopted grandmother.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.607
Well then why don't you get a new one?

14:35.608 --> 14:37.543
Because all the good ones are taken.

14:37.544 --> 14:40.813
Just wait, people get old all the time

14:40.814 --> 14:44.483
and remember,
virtue is it's own reward.

14:44.484 --> 14:45.984
Thanks for the advice.

14:45.985 --> 14:47.437
Now can I give you some?

14:47.821 --> 14:49.655
Get some tattoos,
you'll work forever.

14:53.026 --> 14:56.462
It's not fair, she was mine first.

14:56.463 --> 14:57.563
Not that I don't enjoy

14:57.564 --> 14:59.431
getting to know you Mrs. Hartle.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.035
So,  James Michener's, 'Hawaii'

15:03.036 --> 15:05.437
Now what's this about?

15:05.438 --> 15:07.673
You make it sound like so much fun Mr. Berry.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.241
Why did they call it the depression?

15:09.242 --> 15:12.544
Not everybody liked apples as much as I did.

15:12.545 --> 15:14.480
So tell me more about Ethan Hawke.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.648
Oh, he's a nice boy.

15:16.649 --> 15:19.585
- Does he ever come to visit?
- when I call him.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.955
Well, what are you waiting for?

15:22.956 --> 15:24.289
'Toys made from Taro root'

15:24.290 --> 15:25.904
Isn't that fascinating?

15:26.926 --> 15:28.327
I'll read on.

15:29.796 --> 15:32.898
Hi Sabrina. I was just getting
some sodas for me and Nana.

15:32.899 --> 15:34.400
That's nice, I'm going home.

15:34.401 --> 15:36.969
So soon, why?

15:36.970 --> 15:39.371
Well I've been here two hours
and Mrs. Hartle woke up

15:39.372 --> 15:42.264
just long enough to tell me why
foreigners are ruining this country

15:42.442 --> 15:43.876
and then she went back to sleep.

15:43.877 --> 15:45.010
Oh too bad.

15:45.011 --> 15:46.912
Nana and I are having the best time.

15:46.913 --> 15:48.113
In fact I think this project

15:48.114 --> 15:50.282
may turn out to be very rewarding.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.950
I should thank you for that, Sabrina.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.152
You're thanking me?

15:53.153 --> 15:54.687
Well I'd better go back in now,

15:54.688 --> 15:56.822
I don't want to keep my Nana waiting.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.198
Would you innitial here sir?

16:07.033 --> 16:08.067
Thank you,

16:08.068 --> 16:10.035
and it's Ma'am.

16:11.104 --> 16:13.372
- Who was that?
- More flowers.

16:13.743 --> 16:16.375
Huh, Rick is not giving up easily.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.410
He is one determined young man...

16:18.411 --> 16:21.380
but not so young as to make
a relationship impossible.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.182
They are beautiful aren't they?

16:23.183 --> 16:25.584
Zeldy, do what you want but er,

16:25.585 --> 16:27.086
my female intuition tells me

16:27.087 --> 16:29.455
you still like this guy and if that's true

16:29.456 --> 16:31.523
you shouldn't let age get in the way.

16:31.524 --> 16:33.792
You're as young as you feel.

16:33.793 --> 16:37.096
I'm six hundred and twelve, do I look it?

16:37.097 --> 16:39.665
Well, the beard makes you look older

16:39.666 --> 16:41.800
but you might be right.

16:41.801 --> 16:44.136
There's a lot of stuff about Rick I like and

16:44.137 --> 16:45.671
maybe he'll mature.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.306
I think I'll call him.

16:47.307 --> 16:49.908
Oh and Hilda, thank's for caring.

16:49.909 --> 16:51.035
That's what sisters are for.

16:52.338 --> 16:54.679
Oh wait! Oh! Aw!
Don't pull, aw!!

16:55.482 --> 16:59.852
And so the outer ear channels
the sound waves to the ear-drum...

16:59.853 --> 17:01.453
which picks up the vibrations....

17:01.454 --> 17:03.922
Then three tiny bones in the middle ear...

17:03.923 --> 17:05.991
carry the movement to the cochleae...

17:05.992 --> 17:07.693
Which is filled with fluid and cells...

17:07.694 --> 17:09.395
with tiny hairs that move

17:09.396 --> 17:12.064
and do you think I can't hear you whispering?

17:12.065 --> 17:14.666
Come on, I've got three tiny
bones in my ear.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.835
Now does someone want to tell
me what this is all about?

17:20.240 --> 17:21.874
What! Libby's gonna meet Ethan Hawke?

17:21.875 --> 17:23.208
How do you know him?

17:23.209 --> 17:25.109
He's a friend of a friend.

17:25.111 --> 17:27.146
You do a good deed, you get a little back.

17:28.948 --> 17:30.015
What's so funny?

17:30.016 --> 17:31.950
Oh, um...

17:31.951 --> 17:33.619
the word cochleae.

17:35.455 --> 17:37.322
You were laughing at me in class weren't you?

17:37.323 --> 17:38.624
- No, I wasn't.
- Yes, you were.

17:38.625 --> 17:39.792
- No, I wasn't.
- Oh come on,

17:39.793 --> 17:42.434
I've laughed at enough people to
know when I'm being laughed at.

17:42.560 --> 17:43.696
Okay I was,

17:43.697 --> 17:45.898
but just because I never
thought you'd be so gullible.

17:45.899 --> 17:49.168
Gullible? D'you wanna tell
me what you mean by that?

17:49.169 --> 17:50.269
Quietly.

17:50.270 --> 17:53.005
Let's see, how can I put this nicely?

17:53.006 --> 17:54.807
Oh, I can't.

17:54.808 --> 17:56.208
Nana's whacked!

17:56.209 --> 17:58.344
Look, she doesn't know Pete,
she doesn't know Keanu,

17:58.345 --> 18:00.412
she doesn't know Noah
and she doesn't know Brad.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.448
Yes she does, I've seen
the scrap book.

18:02.449 --> 18:03.549
So have I,

18:03.550 --> 18:04.983
it's all cut outs from magazines

18:04.984 --> 18:06.418
but have you seen any real proof?

18:06.419 --> 18:08.887
She has a Johnny Pneumonic T-shirt.

18:08.888 --> 18:11.256
Look, I fell for it to. I mean who wouldn't...

18:11.257 --> 18:13.158
Until the DiCaprio turtles.

18:13.159 --> 18:16.261
You mean Leonardo didn't make this?

18:17.630 --> 18:20.299
Eat it, let the sugar comfort you.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.834
Then all the time I spent with Nana

18:21.835 --> 18:23.535
has been a total waste.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.270
No, you made a dear old woman happy.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.271
Oh please!

18:26.272 --> 18:28.007
If I could sue, I would.

18:28.008 --> 18:29.958
Look, why don't you just forget about it?

18:30.099 --> 18:32.790
How? It was just announced
to the whole class,

18:32.812 --> 18:34.580
which means It will spread to the entire school

18:34.581 --> 18:35.748
which is exactly what I wanted

18:35.749 --> 18:37.449
when I thought I was gonna meet Ethan.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.617
Libby, you're getting all red.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.986
I'm so humiliated.

18:42.055 --> 18:43.655
She's not going to get away with this.

18:43.656 --> 18:44.923
What is that supposed to mean?

18:44.924 --> 18:47.292
After school I'm going to the Senior Center

18:47.293 --> 18:49.094
and rip Nana a new Afghan.

18:49.095 --> 18:51.130
Look, leave her alone.
Why don't you take it out on me,

18:51.131 --> 18:52.564
you love doing that.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.470
I wanna talk to you!

18:58.471 --> 19:00.939
Libby, what a pleasant surprise.

19:00.940 --> 19:03.776
Sit down Nana, if that is your real name.

19:03.777 --> 19:05.744
What's wrong, you seem upset.

19:05.745 --> 19:09.248
I am upset. You said I was going
to meet Ethan Hawke.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.083
Well... you're not.

19:11.084 --> 19:12.184
So you lied to me.

19:12.185 --> 19:13.385
Oh that's a little harsh.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.587
In my day we called them tall tails.

19:15.588 --> 19:18.424
You have no idea what you have done do you?

19:18.425 --> 19:19.591
Not really.

19:19.592 --> 19:21.560
I'm going to be teased about this for weeks

19:21.561 --> 19:22.628
and then again every time a new
Ethan Hawke movie comes out.

19:24.631 --> 19:27.476
I mean my only hope is his career
takes a total nose dive,

19:27.534 --> 19:30.836
which means I have to root against him
and I really cared.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.137
Sorry.

19:32.138 --> 19:33.972
Sorry's not enough!

19:33.973 --> 19:35.474
You did a number on me.

19:35.475 --> 19:39.211
I hope you're happy you lying, sad,
pathetic old woman!

19:40.013 --> 19:41.057
Libby.

19:41.915 --> 19:44.750
Libby, Libby.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.785
I never meant to hurt you.

19:48.688 --> 19:51.023
Ooow! She was mad.

19:58.365 --> 20:02.601
Sabrina, you were right.
I thoroughly enjoyed my walk.

20:02.602 --> 20:04.570
Well, a little fresh air always does one good.

20:04.571 --> 20:07.473
So is it just you and me
or will Libby be stopping by?

20:07.474 --> 20:10.009
Er, I don't think you'll see her
around here again.

20:10.010 --> 20:11.143
She...

20:11.144 --> 20:13.012
made up with her real grandmother.

20:13.013 --> 20:15.547
Oh that's nice. Oh I'll miss her,

20:15.548 --> 20:17.316
she's such a sweet girl.

20:17.317 --> 20:20.219
Nana, you an excellent judge of character.

20:20.220 --> 20:21.587
Hey, do you wanna catch a movie?

20:21.588 --> 20:23.455
Sure, we'll go and see one of your friends

20:23.456 --> 20:25.257
I think Ethan Hawke has a new movie out.

20:25.511 --> 20:26.959
- U-hu, he called.
- Oh, what did he say?

20:26.960 --> 20:28.460
He asked all about you.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.232
Hey, where have you been?

20:33.233 --> 20:35.801
Nana and I went to see the new Ethan Hawke movie

20:35.802 --> 20:37.336
and its going to be huge.

20:37.337 --> 20:38.570
Hey, you shaved your beard.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.372
Yeah, the up keep was too much

20:40.373 --> 20:43.075
and the weirdest guys kept coming on to me.

20:44.084 --> 20:45.344
Ha-ha-ha! you're nuts.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.912
- Who's aunt Zelda with?
- Rick.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.747
The younger man is back in the picture.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.416
I've got to check this out.

20:50.417 --> 20:51.817
Pardon me.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.687
- Mr. Berry!
- Sabrina?

20:54.688 --> 20:56.088
You know each other?

20:56.089 --> 20:57.790
Yes, from the Senior Center.

20:57.791 --> 20:59.291
What a small world.

20:59.292 --> 21:00.759
Sabrina is my niece.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.594
You look too young to be her aunt.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.330
Oh, Rick.

21:05.331 --> 21:07.299
I'll leave you two alone.

21:09.536 --> 21:10.969
Hey Salem, d'you wanna,

21:11.666 --> 21:12.971
What happened to you?

21:12.972 --> 21:17.276
Too much soup. Groom me.
Please groom me.

21:22.715 --> 21:25.250
Hey Zelda, did you have some
of the tuna, noodle casserole

21:25.251 --> 21:27.786
- I put in the fridge last night?
- No. Why?

21:27.787 --> 21:29.288
Somebody took a big chunk out of it.

21:29.289 --> 21:30.489
I'd check with Salem.

21:30.490 --> 21:33.603
Right, Tuna. Well he'll regret that,

21:33.626 --> 21:36.028
- I threw in the left over soup.
- You didn't?

21:36.029 --> 21:38.297
Yes. I know it has horrible side effects

21:38.298 --> 21:40.366
but I just hate throwing away food.

21:41.468 --> 21:42.468
Good morning.

21:43.370 --> 21:45.337
What? What?!

21:45.338 --> 21:46.338
Not Salem.
