00:00.503 --> 00:02.257
Previously on The Vampire Diaries...

00:02.282 --> 00:04.234
If this disrupts your psychic ability,

00:04.259 --> 00:06.054
then why is Damon still your puppet?

00:06.079 --> 00:08.132
I gave him a look at what awaits him,

00:08.157 --> 00:11.377
and even that was enough to make
him flip his humanity switch.

00:11.379 --> 00:13.178
Damon believes in hell.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.813
We have to put him down.

00:14.815 --> 00:17.126
That's the only way that
we can protect ourselves.

00:17.151 --> 00:20.252
I saw the truth. Feelings make you weak.

00:20.254 --> 00:21.253
I'm all yours.

00:21.255 --> 00:22.388
I'm not leaving until

00:22.390 --> 00:23.856
you turn your humanity back on.

00:23.858 --> 00:26.269
I'd rather burn alive than abandon you.

00:26.294 --> 00:29.094
- Bonnie, wake up.
- You Yome back to me.

00:29.096 --> 00:30.296
You're okay now.

00:30.298 --> 00:32.131
And you're stuck with me forever.

00:32.133 --> 00:34.266
- Who's Cade?
- You want to save your brother?

00:34.268 --> 00:36.402
All you have to do is kill the devil.

00:36.404 --> 00:38.771
My sister, she made a deal with Cade.

00:38.773 --> 00:41.540
We feast on the flesh
to keep us beautiful,

00:41.542 --> 00:43.442
and he collects the souls of the wicked.

00:43.444 --> 00:46.011
Incendia.

00:46.013 --> 00:47.680
- I think you're ready.
- For what?

00:47.682 --> 00:49.214
It's a surprise.

00:49.216 --> 00:50.683
- Seline.
- The nanny.

00:50.685 --> 00:52.484
Caroline, you need to get home now.

00:52.486 --> 00:54.853
- Lizzie? Josie?
- Girls!

00:58.626 --> 01:00.865
When was the last
time you saw the nanny?

01:00.890 --> 01:02.061
Here.

01:02.063 --> 01:03.429
She offered to watch the girls for me.

01:03.431 --> 01:05.325
We spoke by phone a few hours ago.

01:05.351 --> 01:07.166
She was getting ready
to put the girls to bed.

01:07.168 --> 01:09.802
I have these. I don't know
which ones you want to use.

01:09.804 --> 01:12.504
This is them. And, uh, this is Sybil,

01:12.506 --> 01:14.473
the woman who we believe is with Seline.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.447
How do you know they're
traveling together?

01:16.472 --> 01:18.072
It's a hunch.

01:18.097 --> 01:19.945
Sybil is Seline's sorta sister.

01:19.947 --> 01:22.915
- "Sorta" sister?
- Look, it doesn't matter.

01:22.917 --> 01:25.784
Are you gonna disseminate
these photos or what?

01:31.826 --> 01:33.292
Hi, Alaric.

01:34.962 --> 01:36.195
Seline.

01:36.197 --> 01:37.663
Where are they?

01:37.665 --> 01:39.164
They're safe with me.

01:39.166 --> 01:40.242
Let me speak to them.

01:40.266 --> 01:42.001
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

01:42.003 --> 01:43.702
Bring them back, please.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.804
Can't do that either.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.640
Why?

01:47.642 --> 01:49.102
Your girls are very special, Ric.

01:49.127 --> 01:50.776
You've always known that.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.645
Special girls have special needs.

01:52.647 --> 01:55.648
The less you know, the better.
Just know that

01:55.650 --> 01:58.317
I am saving them from a lifetime of pain.

01:59.854 --> 02:02.154
You're right.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.889
The less I know, the better.

02:03.891 --> 02:06.091
But I'll tell you,

02:06.093 --> 02:09.261
I could give a damn about your plans,

02:09.263 --> 02:11.764
because they're never gonna happen.

02:12.700 --> 02:15.067
I'm gonna find you...

02:15.069 --> 02:16.502
and I'm gonna kill you.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.203
No discussions,

02:18.205 --> 02:21.173
no last-minute pleas for my sympathy.

02:21.175 --> 02:25.310
You have been in my home with me.

02:25.312 --> 02:28.847
And somehow, in all your scheming,

02:28.849 --> 02:31.884
you've missed just how
far I'm willing to go

02:31.886 --> 02:33.318
to protect my children.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.854
I'm not coming for you.

02:35.856 --> 02:39.224
I'm coming for them.

02:39.226 --> 02:42.394
But the longer you run,

02:42.396 --> 02:46.565
the more I'm gonna hurt you.

02:50.438 --> 02:51.904
Hey, sissy.

02:55.209 --> 02:56.608
Sybil?

02:56.610 --> 02:59.278
Quite the family reunion
you've sprung on us.

03:00.681 --> 03:04.149
Hey, little munchkins. Remember me?

03:07.610 --> 03:12.735

03:16.097 --> 03:19.331
You have no idea how much I missed you.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.633
I'm beginning to get the picture.

03:23.237 --> 03:25.537
Three months of

03:25.539 --> 03:26.972
pushing you back into

03:26.974 --> 03:29.208
the darkest corners of my mind.

03:29.210 --> 03:32.121
Cheerleader fantasies aside,
you're much better in person.

03:32.146 --> 03:34.680
Don't you forget it.

03:37.218 --> 03:39.885
I'm famished.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.520
Surely there's a granola bar

03:41.522 --> 03:44.123
tucked away in this shrine
to your adolescence.

03:44.125 --> 03:45.390
Oh, admit it,

03:45.392 --> 03:47.826
you find my high school bedroom sexy.

03:51.065 --> 03:53.499
I'm blowing up.

03:56.337 --> 03:58.103
They're all from Caroline.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:07.214 --> 04:08.947
You're sure Stefan put him down?

04:08.949 --> 04:11.283
Not so sure anymore.

04:13.287 --> 04:14.720
Damon?

04:21.295 --> 04:22.628
Enzo!

04:24.110 --> 04:26.832
Enzo? Enzo!

04:28.803 --> 04:31.036
Enzo. Enzo!

04:33.700 --> 04:36.141
Hey. I compelled the sheriff
to make this case a priority.

04:36.143 --> 04:38.110
Should bypass some red tape.

04:38.112 --> 04:39.711
Where to first?

04:39.713 --> 04:41.313
That's a question for Alaric.

04:41.315 --> 04:42.476
He's on the phone with Matt.

04:42.501 --> 04:43.682
I'll go put this in the car.

04:43.684 --> 04:46.218
No. Stop.

04:46.220 --> 04:47.820
You're not coming.

04:47.822 --> 04:49.154
What?

04:49.156 --> 04:50.622
Ric and I can handle it from here.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.057
And if you really want to help,

04:52.059 --> 04:54.927
then just stay with Matt
and work with the police.

04:54.929 --> 04:56.461
Caroline, you can't be serious.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.797
The twins have been
abducted by two sirens,

04:58.799 --> 05:00.532
and you expect me to just hang back?

05:00.534 --> 05:02.134
Damon is with them.

05:02.136 --> 05:03.468
Right. Which is exactly why

05:03.470 --> 05:04.603
I should come with you.

05:04.628 --> 05:08.240
Let me be perfectly clear, Stefan.

05:08.242 --> 05:11.109
If Damon gets in between me and my girls,

05:11.111 --> 05:13.011
I am going to kill him.

05:13.013 --> 05:17.082
So no, you cannot come with me.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.590
Just don't say anything.

05:24.592 --> 05:27.226
Just listen.

05:29.563 --> 05:33.398
Until this is all over, there is no us.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.868
There's only me and my kids

05:35.870 --> 05:37.469
and their father.

05:37.471 --> 05:40.894
They're all depending on me.

05:40.919 --> 05:44.309
I can't afford any distractions

05:44.311 --> 05:45.878
or compromises,

05:45.880 --> 05:49.114
especially when it comes to your brother.

05:51.919 --> 05:54.853
Matt has a, uh...

05:54.855 --> 05:57.289
a partial trace on Seline's cell.

05:57.291 --> 05:59.558
They're near Oakwood.

06:01.762 --> 06:03.829
Let's go.

06:15.776 --> 06:18.377
Mm-mm.

06:18.379 --> 06:21.652
Mm-mm-mm.

06:21.677 --> 06:24.496
Bacon makes a good case
for the existence of God.

06:26.453 --> 06:28.220
What are you staring at?

06:28.222 --> 06:30.422
How do you go from island cannibal

06:30.424 --> 06:32.658
to naughty Mary Poppins?

06:32.660 --> 06:34.092
And who are you?

06:34.094 --> 06:35.594
Because from where I'm sitting,

06:35.596 --> 06:36.995
you look like a sad lap dog

06:36.997 --> 06:38.697
under the thrall of a psychopath.

06:38.699 --> 06:41.400
Um, pot, kettle, sissy.

06:41.402 --> 06:43.835
And for all you know,
the last 200-plus years

06:43.837 --> 06:46.939
that I spent in that vault
has changed me for the better.

06:46.941 --> 06:48.941
Maybe I'm a reformed woman.

06:48.943 --> 06:50.242
She isn't.

06:50.244 --> 06:53.645
Still, I had a lot of time in that vault

06:53.647 --> 06:55.380
to think and rot,

06:55.382 --> 06:58.383
and wonder what happened
to my dear Seline,

06:58.385 --> 07:00.419
who escaped, when was it, in 1883,

07:00.421 --> 07:01.920
that you slipped through the clutches

07:01.922 --> 07:04.156
of that idiot, Dalton St. John?

07:04.158 --> 07:05.338
The Armory was hunting me.

07:05.363 --> 07:07.993
I had to disappear,
and then I had to blend in.

07:07.995 --> 07:10.128
Oh, you blended in all right.

07:10.130 --> 07:13.065
With your French manicure
and your preppy sneakers

07:13.067 --> 07:15.600
and your voice so American.

07:15.602 --> 07:18.003
Mm-hmm, I can see how
hard you were working

07:18.005 --> 07:19.371
to rescue me.

07:19.373 --> 07:21.773
I was trying to find a way
to free you, Sybil.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.309
Not just from the vault. From everything.

07:24.311 --> 07:26.272
And I was finally on the verge,

07:26.297 --> 07:28.313
until you broke out and blew my cover.

07:28.315 --> 07:30.148
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.911
Did my freedom ruin your idiotic plan

07:32.936 --> 07:34.019
for these two children?

07:34.021 --> 07:35.954
I'm sorry, I'm missing something here.

07:35.979 --> 07:39.417
How does an evil siren scheme,
centuries in the making,

07:39.442 --> 07:41.393
involve three-year-olds?

07:41.395 --> 07:42.728
They're freaks of nature.

07:42.730 --> 07:45.030
Siphon twins who share a psychic link.

07:45.032 --> 07:47.199
We weren't much older
when we met the devil.

07:47.201 --> 07:49.034
It's obvious, isn't it?

07:49.036 --> 07:51.770
She wants to offer them to Cade.

08:02.726 --> 08:04.893
Shouldn't there be more chatter
from your cop friends?

08:04.895 --> 08:06.528
I'm not exactly in the loop anymore,

08:06.530 --> 08:09.498
but don't worry,
tips are about to start flying.

08:10.701 --> 08:12.234
Where the hell are they going?

08:12.236 --> 08:14.036
You tell me. He's your brother.

08:15.539 --> 08:17.839
I need help.

08:23.414 --> 08:25.581
It was Sybil. She sang.

08:25.583 --> 08:27.482
She-she's wormed her
way back into my head.

08:27.484 --> 08:30.852
God, the pain is moving,

08:30.854 --> 08:32.587
and it feels like I'm being cut open.

08:32.590 --> 08:35.957
- Can you see her? Can you talk to her?
- No.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.491
Sybil told me she was
able to manipulate Damon

08:37.494 --> 08:39.126
by invading his subconscious.

08:39.129 --> 08:40.696
If you can't see or feel her,

08:40.698 --> 08:42.597
- she must be in yours.
- Funny.

08:42.600 --> 08:43.865
Because consciously and subconsciously,

08:43.866 --> 08:45.426
I want to rip her bloody head off!

08:45.451 --> 08:48.437
You can get inside his head. Right?

08:48.439 --> 08:50.205
Like you've done with mine?

08:50.207 --> 08:53.375
I don't know, I've never
gone deeper than the surface.

08:56.113 --> 08:57.813
Congrats, mate.

08:57.815 --> 09:01.116
You're about to have a tour
of some very dark places.

09:14.098 --> 09:16.265
I gotta say,

09:16.267 --> 09:18.467
you're a man with a lot of guts.

09:20.204 --> 09:21.503
Why are you doing this?

09:23.307 --> 09:26.441
It's simple. I'm punishing you.

09:26.443 --> 09:30.078
Nobody escapes me.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.647
Not ever.

09:32.888 --> 09:35.484
Bend you to my will with one hand,

09:35.486 --> 09:37.853
while I eat greasy diner
food with the other.

09:37.855 --> 09:40.522
...greasy diner
food with the other.

09:40.524 --> 09:42.324
I won't go back to being your lackey.

09:43.394 --> 09:45.861
Fine by me.

09:45.863 --> 09:47.864
I'm not here to win you back.

09:50.167 --> 09:52.834
I'm just here for the screams.

09:59.643 --> 10:01.610
What did you see?

10:01.612 --> 10:05.113
Matt, I need you to pull up a list
of all the diners in Oakwood.

10:05.115 --> 10:07.449
- Why?
- Because Sybil's at one of them,

10:07.451 --> 10:09.951
and she has no idea that we're onto her.

10:09.953 --> 10:13.889
Child sacrifice is a little hardcore,
don't you think?

10:13.891 --> 10:16.625
Let me top that off for ya.

10:17.928 --> 10:20.195
I'm not sacrificing them.

10:20.197 --> 10:22.864
I am presenting them to Cade.

10:22.866 --> 10:25.646
Offering them as our replacements.

10:27.349 --> 10:29.237
Obviously not right away.

10:29.239 --> 10:32.018
I didn't plan on having my cover
broken three months into the job.

10:32.043 --> 10:32.941
This is ridiculous.

10:32.943 --> 10:34.776
Shh. Hang on.

10:34.778 --> 10:36.678
Rewind.

10:36.680 --> 10:38.013
Replacements?

10:38.015 --> 10:39.848
If Cade accepts Lizzie and Josie

10:39.850 --> 10:41.817
as his new missionaries,

10:41.819 --> 10:44.553
Sybil and I are free.

10:44.555 --> 10:45.887
And I finally will have atoned

10:45.889 --> 10:49.157
for what I did to you on that island.

10:51.362 --> 10:53.729
What are you doing with my phone?

10:53.731 --> 10:56.131
What's an AMBER Alert?

10:56.133 --> 10:59.000
A gift of modern technology.

10:59.002 --> 11:01.169
And proof that Auntie Seline's plan

11:01.171 --> 11:02.571
needs a little tweaking.

11:02.573 --> 11:04.673
Girls, wake up.

11:12.149 --> 11:13.515
Ooh.

11:13.517 --> 11:16.785
Looks like you have a lot of work to do.

11:34.338 --> 11:36.445
Take the next right,
the diner'll be a mile ahead

11:36.470 --> 11:37.239
on your left.

11:37.241 --> 11:39.708
And if it's a dead end like the last three?

11:39.710 --> 11:41.777
Then... I don't know, Ric.

11:41.779 --> 11:43.412
But Stefan will find them.

11:43.414 --> 11:45.046
Somehow.

11:45.048 --> 11:47.416
Yeah, well, if you were sure
of that he'd be driving

11:47.418 --> 11:48.950
and not me.

11:48.952 --> 11:52.320
And you'd still be wearing his ring.

11:56.927 --> 11:58.593
Turn there.

12:12.643 --> 12:14.643
Tell me you found them.

12:14.645 --> 12:16.978
No, but they were just here, so,

12:16.980 --> 12:18.313
whatevat you're doing with Enzo,
it's working.

12:18.315 --> 12:20.749
Look, Sybil is mentally torturing him

12:20.751 --> 12:23.185
and I think my prying around
his head is making it worse.

12:23.187 --> 12:24.386
I don't care.

12:24.388 --> 12:25.787
- Ric...
- I'm serious, Stefan.

12:25.789 --> 12:26.988
Enzo's the best chance I have

12:26.990 --> 12:28.457
at getting my kids back, so if you have to

12:28.459 --> 12:29.724
turn his brain into oatmeal,

12:29.726 --> 12:31.358
that's what you do, understood?

12:33.086 --> 12:34.352
Let me talk to Caroline.

12:38.189 --> 12:40.389
Now's not a good time.

12:40.391 --> 12:43.225
Just make sure

12:43.227 --> 12:44.760
she knows I'm doing everything I can.

12:44.762 --> 12:47.262
Yeah, well, do more.

12:54.472 --> 12:57.272
Here's what I don't get.

12:57.274 --> 13:00.476
Why would Cade want the
wonder twins instead of you?

13:00.478 --> 13:02.479
Hmm?

13:02.504 --> 13:04.480
'Cause their little faces don't scream

13:04.482 --> 13:05.573
Grim Reaper to me.

13:05.598 --> 13:07.416
I've spent almost a century searching

13:07.418 --> 13:09.218
for the right offering. Trust me,

13:09.220 --> 13:11.220
- they're perfect.
- They're toddlers.

13:11.222 --> 13:14.423
I could've done better in a
half an hour on Craigslist.

13:14.425 --> 13:16.191
Their age is actually a plus.

13:16.193 --> 13:17.393
In order to serve Cade,

13:17.395 --> 13:18.894
you have to meet certain criteria.

13:18.896 --> 13:20.769
Blah blah blah.

13:20.794 --> 13:23.032
Damon, turn the radio on.

13:23.034 --> 13:24.733
One minute.

13:24.735 --> 13:25.968
Promise.

13:25.970 --> 13:27.770
Criteria?

13:27.772 --> 13:29.505
Well, like me and my obnoxious sister,

13:29.507 --> 13:31.040
Cade's missionaries

13:31.042 --> 13:32.941
must be supernatural.

13:32.943 --> 13:35.344
They have to serve him
of their own free will.

13:35.346 --> 13:37.780
Two siphons.

13:37.782 --> 13:40.082
Two young, impressionable minds.

13:40.084 --> 13:41.884
And they trust me more
and more every day.

13:41.886 --> 13:43.118
I can convince them

13:43.120 --> 13:45.220
that this is something that they want.

13:45.222 --> 13:48.824
And if Cade accepts the deal, then...

13:48.826 --> 13:50.793
we're in the clear.

13:50.795 --> 13:52.027
From him.

13:52.029 --> 13:53.262
From hell.

13:53.264 --> 13:54.463
Forever.

13:54.465 --> 13:56.865
Wow.

13:56.867 --> 14:00.302
All this time, I thought
hell was a one-way ticket.

14:00.304 --> 14:02.271
It is.

14:02.273 --> 14:06.108
Unless you find exactly the
right carrots to dangle.

14:08.636 --> 14:10.893
Looks like your little
plan has hit a roadblock.

14:12.349 --> 14:13.582
Literally.

14:13.584 --> 14:15.017
Shut up and let me

14:15.019 --> 14:17.186
- handle this.
- Are we there yet?

14:17.188 --> 14:18.787
Oh, great, this should be interesting.

14:18.789 --> 14:20.689
It's okay, Lizzie.

14:20.691 --> 14:23.592
Be a good girl and go back to sleep.

14:26.363 --> 14:27.696
Hello, Officer.

14:27.698 --> 14:29.298
Is everything okay?

14:29.300 --> 14:31.500
We have an AMBER Alert out
for two missing children.

14:31.502 --> 14:33.335
Mind if I take a look inside?

14:33.337 --> 14:35.637
Sure thing. Go right ahead.

14:48.285 --> 14:50.052
Thanks for your time.

14:50.054 --> 14:51.920
Sorry to bother you folks.

14:53.254 --> 14:56.658
I don't want to sleep anymore.

15:33.214 --> 15:35.247
Looks like someone's taking charge.

15:35.249 --> 15:37.049
Why are we stopping here?

15:37.051 --> 15:40.052
Because I have been with you

15:40.054 --> 15:41.820
for roughly five hours,

15:41.822 --> 15:43.255
and in that time you've
almost been captured

15:43.257 --> 15:44.757
by the bumbling

15:44.759 --> 15:47.726
human authorities, not once... twice.

15:47.728 --> 15:49.394
On the plus side, I'm happy to see

15:49.396 --> 15:50.896
that there's some wiggle
room in this arrangement

15:50.898 --> 15:52.364
of eternal servitude.

15:52.366 --> 15:53.799
So,

15:53.801 --> 15:55.100
let's do this.

15:55.102 --> 15:56.101
- Hmm?
- Do what?

15:56.103 --> 15:57.736
Call the big man.

15:57.738 --> 15:59.805
Tell me exactly what we need to do

15:59.807 --> 16:02.274
to summon him up
and then let's get to it.

16:02.276 --> 16:04.676
I'm not telling you.

16:04.678 --> 16:07.045
A body of water, a couple
of human bodies...

16:07.047 --> 16:09.148
- Sybil.
- Perfect.

16:09.150 --> 16:10.530
Look at this.

16:10.555 --> 16:11.748
We have a pool,

16:11.773 --> 16:14.486
we have some residents... ah, and-and look:

16:14.488 --> 16:16.889
free HBO.

16:16.891 --> 16:18.023
Are you dense?

16:18.025 --> 16:19.892
This is a long game.

16:19.894 --> 16:22.928
Those girls won't be ready
for at least a decade.

16:22.930 --> 16:25.100
No reason we can't get
started on approvals.

16:25.125 --> 16:28.066
- I'm not doing this.
- Oh, yes, you are.

16:28.068 --> 16:29.467
You know why?

16:29.492 --> 16:32.037
Because you want to get out
of hell as much as I do.

16:32.039 --> 16:34.973
And with a little help,
I have a way that we can all win.

16:34.975 --> 16:36.909
A plan, a good one.

16:36.911 --> 16:38.777
Get the kids out of the car seats.

16:38.779 --> 16:41.547
Let's go summon the devil.

16:51.458 --> 16:53.325
What are we gonna do?

16:53.327 --> 16:54.660
We have to help him.

16:54.662 --> 16:56.295
I can go inside his mind again

16:56.297 --> 16:57.996
but I don't know if that's a good idea.

17:00.267 --> 17:02.401
Do it.

17:06.640 --> 17:09.308
Just be careful.

17:17.387 --> 17:19.184
A state cop called in
the minivan's plates

17:19.185 --> 17:20.452
from that location.

17:23.656 --> 17:25.544
- They were here.
- What did they do to him?

17:25.569 --> 17:27.226
You don't want to know.

17:27.228 --> 17:28.460
What about Enzo?

17:28.462 --> 17:30.562
Nothing yet.

17:30.564 --> 17:32.097
He's unconscious.

17:32.099 --> 17:33.298
Stefan's still trying.

17:37.121 --> 17:39.404
She's been right in front
of me the whole time.

17:39.406 --> 17:41.039
I-I should've noticed something.

17:41.041 --> 17:42.274
I-I should've felt something!

17:42.276 --> 17:44.676
We'll find them, okay? We will.

17:44.678 --> 17:46.645
Nothing else matters.

17:46.647 --> 17:48.780
We will find them.

17:57.591 --> 17:59.057
These people have no idea

17:59.059 --> 18:03.095
they're all about to die horribly.

18:03.097 --> 18:06.832
They're not exactly the
shining stars of society.

18:06.834 --> 18:11.703
You should know, if Cade
feels used or disrespected,

18:11.705 --> 18:14.106
there's no telling what he might do.

18:14.108 --> 18:17.209
I'll tread lightly.

18:17.211 --> 18:22.214
Seline said you had to consent
to be Cade's missionary.

18:22.216 --> 18:26.023
But that's not what
your story sounds like.

18:28.455 --> 18:31.423
I was dead.

18:33.562 --> 18:35.661
But even in death, Cade's psychic power

18:35.663 --> 18:40.032
reached into my soul and
heard my screams for life.

18:40.034 --> 18:43.235
No one wants to die.

18:43.237 --> 18:44.111
In that moment,

18:44.136 --> 18:46.064
you'll agree to anything,

18:46.089 --> 18:48.507
even slavery in hell.

18:49.677 --> 18:53.979
Oh, well, that's good to know.

18:53.981 --> 18:56.949
Because I have a deal of my own in mind,

18:56.951 --> 18:59.117
and I'm gonna need
your help to pull it off.

19:00.187 --> 19:02.354
Go on.

19:05.926 --> 19:09.828
I can multi-task.

19:18.772 --> 19:20.439
Where are the children?

19:20.441 --> 19:22.975
Tell me, and you can do whatever
you want with me, I don't care.

19:22.977 --> 19:25.877
I'm already doing
what I want with you.

19:29.216 --> 19:31.016
You're dying, Enzo.

19:43.864 --> 19:46.965
There you are.

19:46.990 --> 19:48.900
I was wondering when
you'd shift from creeper

19:48.902 --> 19:50.135
to participant.

19:50.137 --> 19:51.503
Where are the twins?

19:51.505 --> 19:54.039
I'll make you a deal.

19:54.041 --> 19:56.875
You come alone and I'll let Enzo live.

19:56.877 --> 19:58.210
No, mate.

19:58.212 --> 20:00.178
You can't trust her.

20:00.180 --> 20:01.813
He's right.

20:01.815 --> 20:03.982
But you're still gonna come. Alone.

20:03.984 --> 20:05.517
Damon and I

20:05.519 --> 20:09.388
have an offer you won't
be able to refuse.

20:29.424 --> 20:31.357
I gave Ric and Caroline
the address to the motel.

20:31.359 --> 20:32.558
They're on their way there now.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.527
Good.

20:34.529 --> 20:36.896
When was the last time you ate something?

20:36.898 --> 20:39.999
I couldn't eat if I wanted to.

20:40.001 --> 20:43.970
I love him so much.

20:46.814 --> 20:50.343
And I'm terrified of losing him.

20:51.218 --> 20:53.460
You won't.

20:53.485 --> 20:54.914
Think about it.

20:54.916 --> 20:56.882
That siren absolutely erased Damon.

20:56.884 --> 20:59.018
She found whatever was good
inside him and crushed it.

20:59.020 --> 21:02.154
Then she tried doing
the same thing to Enzo

21:02.156 --> 21:03.356
and he fought back.

21:03.358 --> 21:06.659
Survived and escaped.

21:08.162 --> 21:10.229
Not so sure he escaped.

21:10.231 --> 21:12.865
He will.

21:12.867 --> 21:14.467
He's a tough bastard.

21:15.981 --> 21:19.048
I'm not sure which
one of you to kiss first.

21:43.475 --> 21:44.741
Yeah, we're here.

21:44.743 --> 21:45.909
Is Stefan there?

21:45.911 --> 21:47.210
No.

21:47.212 --> 21:49.145
Something doesn't seem right.

21:49.147 --> 21:51.748
- What is it?
- Where are the girls?

21:54.162 --> 21:55.682
Matt? Nobody's here.

21:55.707 --> 21:57.787
Where are they? Where's Stefan?

22:09.000 --> 22:11.025
I'm sorry.

22:11.050 --> 22:14.037
You have no right to cut me
out of this. They are my kids.

22:14.039 --> 22:15.136
And you're going to be my wife

22:15.160 --> 22:17.674
and Ric is my friend
and Damon is my brother.

22:17.676 --> 22:19.369
I have a chance to fix this for all of us,

22:19.394 --> 22:22.078
so that's exactly what I'm going to do.

22:23.782 --> 22:25.782
What is it? What's happening?

22:28.077 --> 22:30.620
Let's go.

22:30.622 --> 22:32.077
Go? Where?

22:32.102 --> 22:34.911
I don't know where.
I just need to do something.

22:34.936 --> 22:37.794
Caroline, if something
happens to those girls....

22:37.796 --> 22:39.677
- I know.
- Look, they shouldn't be living this life.

22:39.701 --> 22:41.598
I know!

22:43.635 --> 22:45.535
You know, when we get them back,

22:45.537 --> 22:47.170
I'm taking them away.

22:47.172 --> 22:48.573
As far away from all of you

22:48.598 --> 22:50.264
as possible.

22:50.289 --> 22:51.822
All of...?

22:51.847 --> 22:53.676
I'm sorry, what?

22:53.678 --> 22:56.679
Darkness follows vampires
everywhere you go.

22:56.681 --> 22:58.014
That's what you attract.

22:59.084 --> 23:01.317
Take a breath, Ric.

23:01.319 --> 23:03.086
You can't blame this on me.

23:03.088 --> 23:05.521
Why not, Caroline?!

23:05.523 --> 23:06.990
My kids should've

23:06.992 --> 23:08.791
- never been involved in this!
- Our kids!

23:08.793 --> 23:10.293
My kids.

23:10.295 --> 23:12.895
They're mine, Caroline.

23:14.232 --> 23:16.065
Mine and Jo's.

23:26.411 --> 23:28.778
All right, girls, just like I taught you.

23:28.780 --> 23:31.214
Now hold my hands and concentrate.

23:37.682 --> 23:39.130
Now, girls.

23:39.155 --> 23:40.321
Incendia.

23:49.534 --> 23:51.467
Stefan should be here by now.

23:51.469 --> 23:53.569
He's here.

23:54.535 --> 23:56.068
Well, were you gonna tell me?

23:56.093 --> 23:58.074
Your precious reunion can wait.

23:58.076 --> 24:00.710
I need Stefan to know
how serious this is.

24:00.712 --> 24:02.779
What did you do?

24:02.781 --> 24:05.048
Set up a little welcoming committee.

24:33.398 --> 24:36.546
Did you seriously siren
every idiot in this rat trap

24:36.548 --> 24:37.947
to kill my brother?

24:37.949 --> 24:40.316
Uh-huh. Do you have a problem with that?

24:40.318 --> 24:42.251
Well, the whole reason I
wanted you to bring him here

24:42.253 --> 24:43.886
requires him to be alive.

24:43.888 --> 24:45.571
Then go save him.

24:45.596 --> 24:48.358
But not until he's reminded
of who he really is.

24:48.360 --> 24:50.345
I want him dark, vulnerable,

24:50.370 --> 24:52.884
actual blood on his hands.

24:52.909 --> 24:55.031
That's how Cade likes them best.

25:14.419 --> 25:15.451
Ah!

25:25.630 --> 25:27.964
Yah!

25:51.322 --> 25:54.824
Quite the moral dilemma.

25:54.826 --> 25:56.361
What's it gonna be, brother?

25:56.386 --> 25:58.995
You gonna take the high road or the low?

25:59.020 --> 26:00.321
Don't do this, Damon.

26:00.323 --> 26:02.432
It's already done, man.

26:02.434 --> 26:04.834
Big boy's sirened to kill you,
just like the rest of them.

26:04.859 --> 26:08.171
Somehow, you've managed
not to kill any of 'em so far.

26:08.173 --> 26:09.803
Piece of advice, Stefan:

26:09.828 --> 26:12.196
Kill him before he kills you.

26:12.198 --> 26:15.037
And another piece of advice:

26:15.062 --> 26:17.434
Turn around. Now.

26:24.877 --> 26:27.878
Oof, sis, you are way off-key.

26:27.880 --> 26:29.746
Maybe that's why Cade isn't answering.

26:29.748 --> 26:32.049
I should have left you
on that island to rot.

26:32.051 --> 26:34.084
Or maybe he's just not interested

26:34.086 --> 26:35.686
in anything you have to say.

26:46.332 --> 26:49.666
On the contrary.

26:49.668 --> 26:52.569
Hello, Seline.

26:52.571 --> 26:57.774
Tell me, what brings me here?

27:14.755 --> 27:16.121
Come on, Stefan.

27:19.193 --> 27:21.426
Don't be so stubborn.

27:24.265 --> 27:25.998
Kill him already.

27:27.401 --> 27:29.201
Why are you doing this?

27:29.203 --> 27:31.603
What's really important
is why you're doing this.

27:32.740 --> 27:34.006
Want to save the twins?

27:34.008 --> 27:35.340
I can help you do that, man.

27:35.342 --> 27:36.708
But first things first.

27:54.762 --> 27:56.461
Ouch. That's gonna leave a mark.

27:56.463 --> 27:59.264
On your soul.

28:04.972 --> 28:06.171
Don't worry, brother.

28:06.173 --> 28:08.907
I got a get out of hell free card

28:08.909 --> 28:10.709
right here in my pocket.

28:13.747 --> 28:15.447
Where are the girls?

28:15.449 --> 28:17.015
I won't ask you again.

28:17.017 --> 28:18.951
I'll be happy to take you to 'em.

28:18.953 --> 28:22.220
Just need you to agree
to a few terms first.

28:25.526 --> 28:27.259
So...

28:27.261 --> 28:29.628
you want your freedom

28:29.630 --> 28:32.064
in exchange for these two

28:32.066 --> 28:34.232
sweet girls.

28:34.234 --> 28:36.620
I told you he wouldn't go for it.

28:36.645 --> 28:38.937
Actually, I'm intrigued.

28:41.308 --> 28:43.842
What do you think?

28:43.844 --> 28:45.611
Seline says you're nice.

28:45.613 --> 28:48.080
Well...

28:48.082 --> 28:51.216
I am, little one.

28:52.943 --> 28:54.360
With time and guidance,

28:54.385 --> 28:57.089
there's no telling what
you two can become.

28:57.091 --> 28:58.423
Cade, do we have a deal or not?

28:58.425 --> 29:00.292
What if I can offer you a better one,

29:00.294 --> 29:01.493
here and now?

29:01.495 --> 29:03.629
What are you talking about?

29:03.631 --> 29:05.464
Two brothers,

29:05.466 --> 29:08.467
two of history's most prolific killers,

29:08.469 --> 29:11.436
two powerful, immortal vampires.

29:11.438 --> 29:14.640
They'll be much more potent
weapons for you than these

29:14.642 --> 29:15.874
helpless children.

29:15.876 --> 29:18.644
Seline and I are simply sirens.

29:18.646 --> 29:20.145
Trust me, you'll be trading up.

29:20.147 --> 29:22.314
Are you serious? There's no way...

29:23.984 --> 29:25.550
I'll do it.

29:26.954 --> 29:29.221
Just let the girls go.

29:45.139 --> 29:46.705
- Mommy!
- Daddy!

29:46.707 --> 29:49.107
Hey, darling. Hey.

29:49.109 --> 29:51.109
Ooh. Oh, my gosh. Oh.

29:51.111 --> 29:53.198
Oh, my gosh.

29:53.223 --> 29:55.580
- Oh, it's so good to see you.
- Thank you.

29:55.582 --> 29:56.882
- It's so good to see you.
- I missed you too.

29:56.884 --> 29:58.884
Hey...

29:58.886 --> 30:00.152
I missed you,

30:00.154 --> 30:01.753
too.

30:15.536 --> 30:18.270
I'm fine, luv. Really.

30:20.708 --> 30:22.908
I know.

30:24.311 --> 30:26.812
I just fought so hard to
get you back, and...

30:26.814 --> 30:28.680
here you are, still suffering

30:28.682 --> 30:31.349
for what Sybil put you through.

30:31.351 --> 30:33.185
I hope you know how much I appreciate

30:33.187 --> 30:35.220
how hard you fought to get back to me.

30:36.590 --> 30:37.789
That's what I do.

30:39.526 --> 30:41.460
It's what I'll always do.

30:42.896 --> 30:44.996
How did you keep fighting

30:44.998 --> 30:47.566
so long after Damon broke?

30:52.106 --> 30:54.072
I was an orphan.

30:54.074 --> 30:56.908
Abused. Abandoned.

30:59.012 --> 31:00.879
Spent the better part of my life tortured

31:00.881 --> 31:04.883
by a man who stripped me of my identity.

31:04.885 --> 31:07.252
A century like that, you harden
your heart and your mind

31:07.254 --> 31:09.154
till you're made of stone.

31:11.125 --> 31:15.327
But... you're not.

31:15.329 --> 31:16.628
You're kind.

31:18.966 --> 31:21.433
And you are loving.

31:21.435 --> 31:24.269
Thanks to you.

31:28.642 --> 31:32.277
All those years,
I kept a secret from the world.

31:32.279 --> 31:34.279
A shred of faith.

31:35.349 --> 31:39.184
See, I never believed that life...

31:39.186 --> 31:41.720
the universe, a higher power,
whatever you want to call it,

31:41.722 --> 31:44.623
nothing...

31:44.625 --> 31:48.293
would allow me to suffer
so much and then die...

31:48.295 --> 31:50.095
without knowing true love.

31:51.465 --> 31:54.132
It'd just be too cruel.

31:57.471 --> 32:00.138
And when I met you...

32:00.140 --> 32:02.541
my faith was rewarded.

32:04.244 --> 32:06.578
So...

32:06.580 --> 32:09.181
basically, I'm an angel.

32:11.785 --> 32:14.486
Bonnie Bennett...

32:14.488 --> 32:17.656
to me, you're the whole damn world.

32:31.438 --> 32:32.671
They should be sleeping

32:32.673 --> 32:34.139
in their own beds.

32:34.141 --> 32:35.640
I just want one of the doctors here

32:35.642 --> 32:37.609
to check them out first.

32:37.611 --> 32:39.711
We can take them home in the morning.

32:44.852 --> 32:46.918
Listen, uh...

32:48.822 --> 32:51.857
...the things I said...

32:51.859 --> 32:54.492
I'm sorry.

32:54.494 --> 32:57.028
I'm really sorry.

32:57.030 --> 32:58.530
You were right.

33:00.868 --> 33:03.935
Genetically, they are not mine.

33:05.739 --> 33:09.007
But I gave birth to them,

33:09.009 --> 33:11.509
I raised them,

33:11.511 --> 33:13.945
I loved them...

33:15.616 --> 33:19.551
...and when they went missing,
I felt like I was dying.

33:21.488 --> 33:25.223
So don't you ever throw
that in my face again.

33:26.860 --> 33:29.394
I won't.

33:29.396 --> 33:31.730
I was out of my mind...

33:31.732 --> 33:33.565
Caroline.

33:37.070 --> 33:38.904
I don't know how to do this.

33:40.440 --> 33:44.209
I don't know how to protect...
my own children.

33:48.682 --> 33:50.582
Yes, you do...

33:53.186 --> 33:56.221
...because you were right
about something else.

33:59.793 --> 34:03.762
Right now, wherever I go...

34:03.764 --> 34:05.597
darkness follows me.

34:08.969 --> 34:11.603
So you need to take them.

34:16.944 --> 34:18.143
Take them

34:18.145 --> 34:20.445
someplace safe...

34:21.748 --> 34:24.449
...until this is all over.

34:30.357 --> 34:33.190
Take them away from me.

35:03.534 --> 35:06.636
That wasn't fair, what I did...

35:06.638 --> 35:08.504
cutting you off like that.

35:14.078 --> 35:16.245
We're partners...

35:16.247 --> 35:18.848
and we should be
making decisions together.

35:31.262 --> 35:35.698
I love you, Stefan, so much.

35:37.835 --> 35:40.269
But I have a really bad feeling
about what you had to do

35:40.271 --> 35:42.705
to get my daughters back...

35:42.707 --> 35:47.243
so if you could just... tell me.

35:47.245 --> 35:48.945
Rip off the Band-Aid.

35:51.649 --> 35:55.117
I asked you to do whatever it took, so...

35:55.119 --> 35:58.087
what did it take?

36:01.092 --> 36:04.493
I gave Damon what he promised me...

36:05.630 --> 36:08.364
...an eternity of misery.

36:09.200 --> 36:11.734
What does that mean?

36:14.405 --> 36:17.873
It means I surrendered
my immortal soul to Cade.

36:17.875 --> 36:20.977
I have to serve him
the way the sirens did.

36:20.979 --> 36:22.945
Deliver the darkest souls to hell

36:22.947 --> 36:25.815
so I don't end up there myself.

36:26.651 --> 36:28.851
No.

36:30.221 --> 36:32.855
No, there has to be...

36:32.857 --> 36:34.757
a way out of this.

36:34.759 --> 36:36.258
You promised me a June wedding.

36:36.260 --> 36:38.060
I know.

36:38.062 --> 36:40.129
I know. I'm sorry.

36:40.131 --> 36:41.597
No, I don't accept that.

36:41.599 --> 36:43.432
You... are going to be

36:43.434 --> 36:45.601
waiting at the end of that aisle for me

36:45.603 --> 36:49.672
and we are going to start
our lives together that day.

36:51.175 --> 36:55.011
Our day is tomorrow.

36:55.013 --> 36:56.178
It's my last day.

36:56.180 --> 36:59.582
No. What? Why?

36:59.584 --> 37:01.717
Because my one condition
was that I get to spend

37:01.719 --> 37:05.221
my last 24 hours of freedom...

37:05.223 --> 37:07.490
with you.

37:19.871 --> 37:24.356
You could've just told me about
your little scheme with Damon.

37:24.909 --> 37:27.710
Yeah, I could have...

37:27.712 --> 37:29.445
but, boy, was it fun watching you

37:29.447 --> 37:32.281
embarrass yourself in front of Cade.

37:32.283 --> 37:34.583
Whatever.

37:34.585 --> 37:36.118
I'm done.

37:36.120 --> 37:39.555
No more rituals...
no more killing in his name.

37:39.557 --> 37:41.457
No more free pass out of hell.

37:42.827 --> 37:46.328
Sorry, sissy, I checked the fine print.

37:46.330 --> 37:50.332
You're about to start making
payments on your karmic debt.

37:50.334 --> 37:52.034
No, I'm supposed to be free of all that.

37:52.036 --> 37:53.602
That's the point of my deal.

37:53.604 --> 37:56.806
You don't have a deal.

37:56.808 --> 38:00.276
You had a proposal, which Cade said no to

38:00.278 --> 38:03.277
when he accepted my better offer.

38:03.815 --> 38:06.582
You cut me out of the agreement?

38:07.752 --> 38:09.085
How could you do that to me?

38:09.087 --> 38:10.119
Hmm...

38:10.121 --> 38:11.620
that is exactly what

38:11.622 --> 38:14.557
I spent 100 years thinking

38:14.559 --> 38:17.293
when you never showed up to rescue me.

38:18.162 --> 38:20.096
I am just...

38:20.098 --> 38:23.866
so glad that I could finally pay you back

38:23.868 --> 38:26.569
for leaving me to rot in the dark.

38:26.571 --> 38:29.038
But I was trying to make up for that

38:29.040 --> 38:31.540
by getting you released from Cade now.

38:31.542 --> 38:34.376
Oh, I'm released, never fear.

38:34.378 --> 38:37.279
I negotiated for myself on the side.

38:37.281 --> 38:41.823
I stay immortal with my powers.

38:42.620 --> 38:44.153
What are you up to?

38:44.155 --> 38:46.956
Let's just say...

38:46.958 --> 38:50.025
the game's not over yet.

38:57.368 --> 38:59.869
Hey, I don't know what you want
me to do with all this stuff.

38:59.894 --> 39:01.370
Oh, that's okay, I'll take care of it.

39:01.372 --> 39:02.371
Thank you.

39:02.373 --> 39:05.007
Yeah, no problem.

39:05.009 --> 39:06.275
No, really,

39:06.277 --> 39:09.411
Matt... thank you.

39:11.048 --> 39:12.982
You know, sometimes...

39:12.984 --> 39:16.919
I think you're the only
sane voice in this...

39:16.921 --> 39:19.455
parade of crazy that we

39:19.457 --> 39:21.223
call our lives.

39:21.225 --> 39:23.526
It doesn't take a crazy
person to want to kill someone

39:23.528 --> 39:25.161
for threatening their kids.

39:25.997 --> 39:27.630
No, I suppose not.

39:30.501 --> 39:32.134
But still...

39:39.610 --> 39:42.611
You know, even I have a
threshold for how much pain

39:42.613 --> 39:44.980
I can watch my friends go through...

39:44.982 --> 39:46.248
how hard they have to fight.

39:49.487 --> 39:52.621
Sometimes it makes me want
to fight back, you know?

40:01.766 --> 40:03.699
A little help around here?

40:10.241 --> 40:13.375
Little, little help here, huh?

40:23.054 --> 40:24.453
Donovan?

40:26.290 --> 40:27.723
Isn't it past your bedtime?

40:31.262 --> 40:33.327
Thanks for showing up.

40:34.532 --> 40:37.099
I've been wanting to
kill someone all day.

40:50.489 --> 40:53.490
I can't have my kids endangered anymore.

40:53.515 --> 40:54.961
And they will

40:54.986 --> 40:58.020
always be endangered as
long as you're alive.

40:58.923 --> 41:02.458
Oh, your timing's hilarious,

41:02.460 --> 41:04.927
'cause I just made the deal of a lifetime.

41:04.929 --> 41:07.963
Hopefully, a thousand lifetimes.

41:16.496 --> 41:18.763
He's had enough, okay? Just finish him.

41:25.082 --> 41:27.783
This is for Tyler.
