00:19.419 --> 00:23.856
I like your poncho. [chuckles]
My dad got me one in Guadalajara.

00:25.725 --> 00:28.455
Milan. Dolce & Gabbana. Fall.

00:29.129 --> 00:30.118
Oh.

00:30.230 --> 00:33.859
- [Man] Betty Suarez?
- Hi! That's me.

00:34.267 --> 00:37.828
Um, I have a hard copy
of my resume if you need it.

00:37.904 --> 00:39.895
Should I follow you?

00:39.973 --> 00:43.704
Actually, there's been a mistake.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.235
A mistake?

00:46.312 --> 00:49.577
All the entry-level positions
we were hiring for...

00:49.649 --> 00:51.514
...they've been filled.

00:52.085 --> 00:53.177
I'm sorry.

00:57.724 --> 00:58.713
Sir!

00:58.792 --> 01:02.159
While you got me here, I thought
I'd tell you a little about myself.

01:02.228 --> 01:05.220
Magazines are my passion,
ever since I was a kid.

01:05.298 --> 01:08.062
I can't imagine a more
amazing place to start my career

01:08.134 --> 01:09.897
than Meade Publications.

01:09.969 --> 01:12.130
I know most of your
magazines inside out.

01:12.205 --> 01:14.833
- I try to devour as much as I can.
- Clearly.

01:16.242 --> 01:19.803
I've learned so much through them.
Stuff so beyond my world.

01:19.879 --> 01:22.780
Who the up-and-comers are
on the London art scene,

01:22.849 --> 01:25.750
or the political machinations in Darfur.

01:25.819 --> 01:28.720
Or which Bali resort
is considered the most romantic.

01:28.788 --> 01:33.020
And I have tons of ideas. I'm always
jotting stuff down on the subway.

01:33.093 --> 01:36.028
I'm getting ahead of myself.
All I really want is a chance

01:36.096 --> 01:38.121
- in any position or publication!
- Bye!

01:38.198 --> 01:40.223
I can type a hundred words a minute!

01:52.946 --> 01:56.575
No! No! No!

02:02.455 --> 02:05.913
I hate telenovelas.
I wanna watch Fashion TV.

02:05.992 --> 02:08.324
Justin, you can watch Fashion TV later,

02:08.394 --> 02:11.795
when your Aunt Betty is baby-sitting,
OK? Come have some flan.

02:11.865 --> 02:14.060
I don't want flan. I'll get fat.

02:14.134 --> 02:18.093
Honey, you're a boy.
It doesn't matter if you're fat or not.

02:19.873 --> 02:22.637
Betty? Did you order
Dad's birthday cake?

02:22.709 --> 02:25.610
Of course. Chocolate volcano,
same one I got last year.

02:26.646 --> 02:29.672
So... how was your interview?

02:29.749 --> 02:31.478
Um...

02:31.551 --> 02:34.987
I think it was really good.
I mean, they were impressed.

02:35.054 --> 02:37.045
You didn't get it.

02:37.123 --> 02:39.785
They said they'd hired
everyone they needed.

02:39.859 --> 02:43.295
I don't understand. You're sharp,
prepared. Someone should've

02:43.363 --> 02:46.730
begged you to work for them
the day you graduated Queens College.

02:46.799 --> 02:50.291
Betty, have you thought
about exploring other options?

02:50.370 --> 02:52.964
Hilda, I am not going to sell Herbalux.

02:53.039 --> 02:54.666
Well, I wasn't saying that...

02:55.675 --> 02:57.905
...necessarily.
- Dad!

02:57.977 --> 03:01.606
- This career is Betty's dream.
- OK.

03:01.681 --> 03:05.879
But I hear somebody else
has some pretty big dreams, too.

03:05.952 --> 03:07.351
What are you talking about?

03:07.420 --> 03:10.480
Justin, tell your Aunt Betty
what her boyfriend was saying.

03:10.557 --> 03:13.856
Walter was on his cell phone
talking to someone and he said,

03:13.927 --> 03:16.521
"She's the one."

03:17.430 --> 03:19.990
- He wants to marry you?
- He does?

03:20.066 --> 03:21.897
Well, would you do it?

03:21.968 --> 03:24.528
Well, I mean,
we haven't talked about that, but...

03:24.604 --> 03:26.663
Well, I think he's a catch. Flan?

03:26.739 --> 03:28.570
[Knocking]

03:28.641 --> 03:29.767
That's him.

03:34.781 --> 03:36.476
Hi, Ignacio, Hilda.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.312
- Hi, Betty.
- Hey.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.679
Here. It's a return.

03:40.753 --> 03:43.517
The mute doesn't work,
but it sounds awesome.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.148
Thank you.

03:51.497 --> 03:53.465
Uh... [clears throat]

03:53.533 --> 03:57.264
- Betty, can we talk?
- Yes. Sure.

03:59.505 --> 04:01.871
Outside? Yeah, OK.

04:01.941 --> 04:05.433
[Romantic music playing]

04:12.352 --> 04:16.118
Celebrity-studded funeral services
were held today for Fey Sommers,

04:16.189 --> 04:21.718
the much loved and hated editor in chief
of fashion bible Mode magazine.

04:22.128 --> 04:24.619
It was the bitch slap
heard round the world

04:24.697 --> 04:28.064
when longtime Mode Creative Director
Wilhelmina Slater

04:28.134 --> 04:32.036
was passed over for the top spot
in favor of Daniel Meade,

04:32.105 --> 04:37.270
the nominally-experienced son of Meade
Publications owner Bradford Meade.

04:37.510 --> 04:40.377
Can the notorious man-whore

04:40.446 --> 04:45.315
translate his talent at bedding women
into dressing them?

05:01.134 --> 05:03.967
- How do you like your new office?
- Oh, you scared me.

05:04.771 --> 05:06.762
Would you just give me a few minutes?

05:06.839 --> 05:11.242
There's some things I need to
wrap up before I leave.

05:13.846 --> 05:16.440
Interesting decorating motif.

05:19.919 --> 05:21.910
You can get up,
he knows you're there.

05:27.593 --> 05:33.327
I'd like to introduce you
to my new assistant... Charmaine.

05:33.399 --> 05:36.391
I'm sorry to interrupt your...
dictation,

05:36.469 --> 05:38.903
but this is not the way
you run a magazine.

05:40.707 --> 05:44.507
- What?
- I'm in love with someone else.

05:47.747 --> 05:52.480
How? I mean, I thought we...

05:55.621 --> 05:56.747
Well, who is it?

06:02.729 --> 06:06.426
- [Betty] Gina Gambarro?
- [Walter] Sorry. I... I...

06:06.499 --> 06:10.367
No, you don't have
to say anything else.

06:14.607 --> 06:17.405
Good luck, Betty... with everything.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.393
- Are you feeling any better?
- I'm fine.

06:38.564 --> 06:40.896
[Phone ringing]

06:42.101 --> 06:43.796
Hello?

06:44.771 --> 06:48.172
- Some guy from Meat Publications.
- "Meade?"

06:49.776 --> 06:53.143
This is Betty Suarez. Mm-hmm.

06:54.180 --> 06:55.841
Are you serious?

06:56.649 --> 06:59.413
Yeah, I... Of course,
I can start tomorrow.

07:00.086 --> 07:03.249
What magazine is this for? Mode?

07:06.859 --> 07:09.589
Yeah, I'll be there
first thing in the morning.

07:09.662 --> 07:12.597
OK. Thank you. Bye.

07:14.634 --> 07:17.125
Assistant to the editor in chief!

07:17.203 --> 07:19.728
I didn't know you
wanted to work for Mode.

07:19.806 --> 07:23.799
Well, this wouldn't have been
my first choice, but if I do good here,

07:23.876 --> 07:26.242
I can go anywhere in the company.

07:26.312 --> 07:29.941
Well, just try and dress fashionably.

07:30.483 --> 07:31.814
Do you have anything?

07:33.586 --> 07:35.247
Actually, I do.

07:42.662 --> 07:45.130
Oh... my... God.

07:50.303 --> 07:53.136
- Hi, you the "before"?
- Huh?

07:53.206 --> 07:55.697
"Before and After." The photo shoot?

07:57.443 --> 08:00.879
Are you delivering something?

08:00.947 --> 08:04.713
Oh, no, no. I work here.

08:06.052 --> 08:08.816
- For?
- For the new editor in chief.

08:12.558 --> 08:14.549
Everyone's in the conference room,

08:14.627 --> 08:17.095
and Daniel's about to start
his first meeting.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.596
- I'm Amanda.
- Betty.

08:18.664 --> 08:22.100
OK, FYI, Betsy, assistants are
usually here before their bosses.

08:22.168 --> 08:26.400
- Oh, I was filling out paperwork in HR.
- Yeah, just don't let it happen again.

08:26.472 --> 08:29.134
So, uh, where do you come from?

08:29.208 --> 08:32.234
- Queens.
- What job did you have?

08:32.311 --> 08:36.077
Oh, well, actually, apart from
internships and part-time jobs

08:36.148 --> 08:39.082
to pay for school,
this is my first real job.

08:39.952 --> 08:43.854
That's funny. I was told I didn't have
enough experience for the position.

08:43.923 --> 08:45.618
It's over there.

08:47.894 --> 08:52.593
You are an attractive, intelligent,
confident businesswoman.

08:53.466 --> 08:56.731
I gotta confess, I'm not gonna
remember everyone's names,

08:56.802 --> 08:57.928
and I'm really...

09:04.110 --> 09:07.307
- Are you OK?
- I'm OK. I'm fine. I'm so sorry.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.247
I'm sorry.

09:11.083 --> 09:13.711
Anyway, uh... I wish I wa...

09:13.786 --> 09:16.084
I'm so sorry.
Can I just... Thank you.

09:16.155 --> 09:20.489
I wish I wasn't coming in as the new guy
under such terrible circumstances.

09:20.560 --> 09:25.862
I realize I have some awful
big... teeth... shoes to fill.

09:25.932 --> 09:29.197
I can't tell you how excited I am
to be working with such

09:29.268 --> 09:32.237
an amazingly talented
and dedicated staff.

09:32.305 --> 09:35.604
I'd like to take the moment
to talk a little about my ideas.

09:35.675 --> 09:39.133
So sorry I'm late.
Oh, you began without me.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.404
- Sorry, Wilhelmina, I waited...
- Shh! Marc.

09:42.481 --> 09:44.039
Gift.

09:47.053 --> 09:48.042
Thank you.

09:48.120 --> 09:51.578
- As I was saying, I really wanna...
- Well, aren't you gonna open it?

09:58.030 --> 09:59.361
Swarovski crystal.

09:59.432 --> 10:03.300
- To commemorate your first day.
- Thank you.

10:03.369 --> 10:05.860
But it is "Daniel," not "Danny."

10:05.938 --> 10:10.432
- What? I'm hellaciously upset, Marc.
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

10:10.509 --> 10:12.238
Purge this from memory, please.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.937
As I was saying,
it's a exciting time for me...

10:16.015 --> 10:19.109
I think we need to discuss
the Fabia Cosmetics supplement.

10:19.185 --> 10:21.915
- Fabia Cosmetics?
- The biggest ad buy of the year

10:21.988 --> 10:24.718
and the only paid layout
editorial ever works on.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.884
I'm sure Fabia will love
whatever we come up with, right?

10:27.960 --> 10:29.951
Daniel, you... you don't understand.

10:30.029 --> 10:32.429
Given the new circumstances,

10:32.498 --> 10:35.899
Fabia needs to sign off on the spread
before we go to print.

10:35.968 --> 10:39.426
Obviously, we're all here
to help you succeed

10:39.505 --> 10:41.996
and we've got plenty of ideas.

10:42.074 --> 10:44.907
I think we need to get back
to work to make sure that this,

10:44.977 --> 10:50.005
your very first issue with your name
on the masthead, sparkles.

10:50.082 --> 10:53.745
OK, everyone, let's not dilly-dally.
Our editor needs us.

10:55.521 --> 10:58.183
- Killer poncho.
- Thanks!

11:06.666 --> 11:08.463
Mr. Meade?

11:09.602 --> 11:11.263
Excuse me, Mr. Meade?

11:11.337 --> 11:15.569
Hi. I just wanted to come
and introduce myself personally.

11:15.641 --> 11:19.270
I'm Betty Suarez.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

11:19.345 --> 11:23.509
Hi, Betty.
Um... who do you work for?

11:23.582 --> 11:28.144
Well, um, I work for you.
I'm your new assistant.

11:30.623 --> 11:32.921
Did you get the crease
under the hairline?

11:32.992 --> 11:35.927
- Yes, Willie.
- [Sighs] Twenty years, Marc.

11:35.995 --> 11:38.964
No one has done more, worked harder.

11:39.031 --> 11:41.022
I have bled for this magazine,

11:41.100 --> 11:43.261
helped make it
into the icon it is today,

11:43.335 --> 11:48.034
and that nasty, nepotistic
son of a bitch gives my job to his...

11:48.107 --> 11:49.574
His son.

11:49.642 --> 11:53.772
Who's a self-absorbed Lothario punk
who knows nothing about fashion.

11:56.082 --> 11:59.882
Tell me the truth.
Is it because I'm getting old?

11:59.952 --> 12:01.852
Absolutely not. [scoffs]

12:01.921 --> 12:04.890
Though you could do with
a tad bit more between the brows.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.820
- So what are you gonna do?
- Just wait and see.

12:09.895 --> 12:12.921
Well, he's well on his way
to falling flat on his face.

12:12.998 --> 12:15.489
I mean, can you believe that assistant?

12:15.568 --> 12:18.628
This is Mode, not Dog Fancy.

12:18.971 --> 12:20.199
Done.

12:23.075 --> 12:26.238
What do you want me to do
with the, uh, leftover?

12:26.912 --> 12:28.903
- All yours.
- [Mouthing] I love you.

12:29.014 --> 12:32.313
[Cell phone ringing]

12:32.685 --> 12:34.175
Give me a moment, Marc.

12:36.088 --> 12:37.851
How are you recovering, darling?

12:39.325 --> 12:41.691
Well, I'm sure you'll feel better

12:41.761 --> 12:45.925
once everything here
starts coming to a boil.

12:46.799 --> 12:48.528
Mm-hmm.

12:55.875 --> 12:57.866
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.308
What are you doing?

12:59.378 --> 13:02.836
Um... I'm just gathering information
on Fabia for Daniel.

13:02.915 --> 13:05.907
Uh! She is so fabulously douchey.

13:05.985 --> 13:07.418
Who's he in with?

13:07.486 --> 13:10.580
Oh, um, Phillippe Michel,
he's a photographer.

13:10.656 --> 13:11.816
Oh.

13:11.891 --> 13:14.291
- He's doing the supplement, isn't he?
- Mm-hmm.

13:14.360 --> 13:17.193
Oh, he's amazing.
He's shot, like, everything.

13:17.263 --> 13:19.925
Yeah... It looks like
they're really good friends.

13:19.999 --> 13:23.435
There'd been some drama.
Daniel hooked up with Phillippe's

13:23.502 --> 13:26.528
ex-girlfriend years ago,
but they're fine now.

13:26.605 --> 13:29.005
Yeah. We went out for, like, a week.

13:29.074 --> 13:32.237
They don't call him "The Tripod"
because he's a photographer,

13:32.311 --> 13:34.370
if you catch my drift.

13:35.181 --> 13:36.876
[Phillippe] This is crap.

13:39.185 --> 13:43.747
No. No. Too down. Too out.

13:43.823 --> 13:47.657
Can't go there. All this is terrible.

13:47.726 --> 13:49.125
That's what I thought.

13:49.195 --> 13:51.493
Phillippe, can I trust you
with something?

13:51.564 --> 13:54.465
Of course, Daniel.
You know you're like a brother to me.

13:54.533 --> 13:57.866
I don't think anyone wants me here,
especially Wilhelmina.

13:57.937 --> 13:59.268
Well, that's no secret.

13:59.338 --> 14:02.705
She's trying to take me in
the wrong direction with this layout.

14:02.775 --> 14:06.211
- Do you have any ideas?
- Like, a million.

14:06.779 --> 14:08.303
But keep things on the QT.

14:08.380 --> 14:10.814
Most of these people
are loyal to Wilhelmina,

14:10.883 --> 14:13.044
and you don't want them
mucking things up.

14:13.118 --> 14:14.949
[Knocking on door]

14:15.020 --> 14:18.717
Um, sorry to interrupt,
but can I get you lunch?

14:18.791 --> 14:20.782
No, no, but you go ahead. Thanks.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.163
Hi, I'm a really big fan of yours.

14:25.231 --> 14:28.394
That travel layout you did
with the tiki torches?

33:50.161 --> 33:54.996
Wait, you can't just cover the pills
and then randomly decide to stop.

33:55.066 --> 33:56.693
But it... This...

33:56.768 --> 33:59.794
It's a real person's health,
it's not a case number.

33:59.871 --> 34:02.362
Give me the phone,
I'll let them have it.

34:02.440 --> 34:05.466
No! No, I don't wanna hold again.

34:05.543 --> 34:08.341
Not again. No! Just wait!

34:13.985 --> 34:17.420
It's fine. We'll just...
We'll get them tomorrow. It's fine.

34:17.487 --> 34:18.853
Thank you, mi amor.

34:18.922 --> 34:22.154
You're much better at dealing
with this bureaucratic stuff.

34:22.226 --> 34:26.594
- Well, you know I don't mind. So...
- I know. You're always so good to me.

34:26.664 --> 34:30.498
So strong. Determined. Optimistic.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.795
Just like your mother was.

34:36.541 --> 34:38.031
[Knocking]

34:41.978 --> 34:44.914
- Why haven't you returned my calls?
- I've been busy.

34:44.982 --> 34:48.440
Betty, I need to talk to you.
I made a terrible mistake.

34:48.518 --> 34:52.080
What, did you realize this
before or after Gina dumped you?

34:52.156 --> 34:54.420
What? No, no. I broke up with her.

34:54.492 --> 34:58.292
Betty, it was wrong,
and I wanna make this up to you. I...

34:58.362 --> 34:59.556
[knocking]

34:59.630 --> 35:00.619
Betty.

35:01.799 --> 35:04.734
- Are you dating someone?
- Walter, please go!

35:04.802 --> 35:07.566
- Dating this guy?
- Look, you need to go.

35:07.638 --> 35:10.630
- Please. You need to go.
- But Betty! I do... I was just...

35:12.310 --> 35:15.177
- What are you doing here?
- I want to talk.

35:19.517 --> 35:21.280
It's a nice place.

35:21.352 --> 35:24.321
Yeah, we're just in-between
interior designers.

35:24.388 --> 35:26.481
- Really?
- No.

35:26.557 --> 35:28.855
Oh, right. It's a joke.

35:31.229 --> 35:33.459
Betty, I'm so sorry.

35:33.531 --> 35:36.864
You didn't deserve
what I put you through.

35:37.969 --> 35:41.461
I listened to all the wrong people
about a lot of things,

35:41.539 --> 35:44.667
and I have no one to blame but myself.

35:47.678 --> 35:50.044
Well, I appreciate that, Daniel.

35:50.114 --> 35:54.551
But you're going to leave here,
and you're going to take your Town Car

35:54.619 --> 35:58.680
back to your SoHo loft and
I'm still gonna be here, out of work,

35:58.756 --> 36:02.089
and dealing with problems
that you'll never understand.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.993
Try me. Betty, come on,
we've all got problems.

36:05.062 --> 36:08.623
Oh, and what are yours, Daniel?
What restaurant you're gonna eat at?

36:08.699 --> 36:10.690
Which model you're gonna sleep with?

36:11.502 --> 36:15.563
Try spending the day on the phone
with some crappy HMO,

36:15.640 --> 36:19.872
getting them to cover your dad's
prescriptions, or try lining up a job,

36:19.944 --> 36:23.380
any job, because you have
to help pay the rent next month.

36:23.681 --> 36:28.118
Look, I lost a brother a while back.

36:29.020 --> 36:32.888
He was the good one in our family,
and I've never quite measured up.

36:32.957 --> 36:35.152
But I am trying.

36:36.260 --> 36:41.095
Betty, I could never compare
my problems to yours, but they're mine.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.759
Nothing's ever easy.

36:49.040 --> 36:53.500
- I saw the layout you made for Fabia.
- You did?

36:54.545 --> 36:58.106
I thought it was
very smart and beautiful.

36:59.016 --> 37:00.643
Well, thank you.

37:00.718 --> 37:05.587
I wanna take your ideas to Fabia,
giving you credit, of course.

37:06.757 --> 37:10.284
I really want you to come back.
Be my assistant.

37:10.361 --> 37:13.421
I promise you, things will be different.

37:14.732 --> 37:19.260
I... Daniel, I mean,
I really have to think about that.

37:22.406 --> 37:25.102
Well, you have tonight.

37:25.176 --> 37:28.543
Otherwise, I'll probably
be out of a job as well.

37:48.299 --> 37:50.028
Did you hear that?

37:52.436 --> 37:54.427
Every word.

38:03.080 --> 38:08.017
- So where the hell is he?
- He said ten AM.

38:09.487 --> 38:11.250
Well, Fabia,

38:11.322 --> 38:17.283
on behalf of the
entire magazine, ci perdoni.

38:17.361 --> 38:20.194
This whole thing has been unacceptable.

38:20.264 --> 38:22.027
Marc...

38:22.099 --> 38:25.899
Now that I have a moment of your time,
I'd like to show you some of my ideas.

38:25.970 --> 38:27.562
[Daniel] Sorry we're late.

38:29.740 --> 38:33.267
There was obviously no time
for a new photo shoot,

38:33.344 --> 38:36.370
so what we're going to be
showing you is just a rough idea.

38:38.549 --> 38:43.418
Wait, no, this is not
the right file. Just one sec.

38:43.521 --> 38:45.785
One second. This is it.

38:48.092 --> 38:52.722
In order to show the softer side
of Fabia Cosmetics,

38:52.797 --> 38:56.289
we're gonna use the concept
of mothers and daughters.

38:56.367 --> 39:01.862
Focusing on the small, special moments
that are usually taken for granted.

39:02.940 --> 39:05.340
The theme being,
it's not the big events,

39:05.409 --> 39:07.775
but the little moments, that matter.

39:07.845 --> 39:09.938
I just had a daughter.

39:10.014 --> 39:14.974
I do none of those things,
but I can understand.

39:15.052 --> 39:18.647
What makes you think this is
going to appeal to my customers?

39:20.191 --> 39:22.159
[Dog growls]

39:25.863 --> 39:29.560
Well, if I... If I may,
I do have the statistics here.

39:29.633 --> 39:33.000
Though one might assume that
your demographic is very young,

39:33.070 --> 39:36.699
in fact, there's been tremendous
brand loyalty since you've launched,

39:36.774 --> 39:40.107
which means that the people
who were teenagers when they began

39:40.177 --> 39:44.580
using your cosmetics, well, now,
like you, they are beginning to

39:44.648 --> 39:49.142
settle down and have children.
Fifty-eight percent, to be exact.

39:50.654 --> 39:54.090
- And you could do this in time?
- [Daniel] Of course.

39:54.158 --> 39:58.822
Did you wanna approve the models
and images beforehand?

39:58.896 --> 40:01.421
No. Just make sure it's not too sappy.

40:02.600 --> 40:06.730
Do a picture where they're pulling
their hair or biting each other.

40:06.804 --> 40:09.637
Well, that's nice. Now I go.

40:16.046 --> 40:17.411
Good work.

40:17.481 --> 40:20.382
- Well, the idea was actually...
- His best one.

40:20.451 --> 40:22.316
Don't you think?

40:25.222 --> 40:28.282
Indeed. Welcome back, boss.

40:29.059 --> 40:30.390
Marc!

40:31.028 --> 40:32.256
Hi.

40:44.074 --> 40:46.770
I'm very unhappy.

40:46.844 --> 40:50.439
It's a setback.
But it's just a matter of time.

40:50.514 --> 40:55.008
Once he's out of the picture,
the company will be ours for the taking.

40:55.085 --> 40:57.645
Considering the way
everything's played out,

40:57.721 --> 41:02.385
it seems to me that you should keep
an eye on that damn ugly assistant.

41:03.160 --> 41:05.458
What's her name?

41:05.529 --> 41:08.123
- Betty.
- Betty.

41:08.199 --> 41:09.427
Betty.

41:09.500 --> 41:12.765
- Betty...
- Betty! Betty!

41:12.837 --> 41:15.305
Oh, Christina,
thank you again, so much.

41:15.372 --> 41:18.705
No, no, no, no, no! Go. Go!

41:22.713 --> 41:25.181
You should've let me
tell them it was your idea.

41:25.249 --> 41:27.809
Don't worry. I will the next time.

41:28.352 --> 41:30.684
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

41:30.754 --> 41:32.915
I've confirmed your lunch for tomorrow,

41:32.990 --> 41:35.754
and your 3:15 with
the graphics department is set.

41:35.826 --> 41:39.159
- The feature editor would like...
- Betty, tomorrow morning.

41:39.230 --> 41:40.993
It's okay.

41:42.967 --> 41:43.956
Good night.

41:47.338 --> 41:49.499
