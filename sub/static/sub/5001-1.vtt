00:58.739 --> 01:01.139
Swish! That's "horse."

01:03.076 --> 01:05.806
- You can't make that.
- Watch me.

01:09.082 --> 01:11.107
You guys are too easy.

01:11.151 --> 01:13.415
Just wait till
I get big like Kareem.

01:13.453 --> 01:15.011
You want to be like Kareem?

01:15.055 --> 01:17.649
All his big butt do
is stand by the basket.

01:17.691 --> 01:21.593
- I be blocking your stuff.
- Yeah, right.

01:21.628 --> 01:23.596
Hey, look. Q.

01:23.630 --> 01:26.463
I thought you said
only girls were moving in.

01:26.500 --> 01:29.435
That's what my mom said.
Hope he can ball.

01:29.469 --> 01:32.836
- Bet he's a scrub like Kelvin.
- Shut up.

01:36.243 --> 01:38.768
- Can I play?
- No.

01:39.913 --> 01:42.143
- You nice?
- Yeah, I'm nice.

01:42.182 --> 01:44.173
All right.

01:44.217 --> 01:46.276
You and Kelvin
against me and Jamal.

01:49.890 --> 01:52.791
- Oh, man!
- He is a girl!

01:52.826 --> 01:56.227
- Girls can't play no ball.
- Better than you.

01:59.433 --> 02:02.368
- What a dog.
- She heard you.

02:02.402 --> 02:05.894
She can only hear dog whistles.

02:05.939 --> 02:07.930
- Check.
- Check.

02:14.448 --> 02:16.416
Damn! She dogged you, man.

02:16.450 --> 02:19.613
- Shut up!
- One-zip.

02:19.653 --> 02:20.642
Lucky.

03:00.126 --> 03:01.559
Damn!

03:12.372 --> 03:14.533
I got her.

03:14.574 --> 03:15.802
Told you I was nice.

03:15.842 --> 03:17.241
I'm gonna be
the first girl in the NBA.

03:17.277 --> 03:19.404
I'll be in the NBA.
You'll be my cheerleader.

03:35.395 --> 03:37.090
Oh, God.

03:42.502 --> 03:44.470
Be quiet.

03:44.504 --> 03:46.301
How you feeling, munchkin?

03:46.339 --> 03:47.670
You tough.

03:48.942 --> 03:51.137
She needs to stop running
around like a boy.

03:51.177 --> 03:54.146
- She's all right.
- Looking the way she does?

03:54.180 --> 03:56.580
Camille, she'll be fine.

03:59.920 --> 04:01.512
Let me find you some gauze.

04:23.343 --> 04:25.436
Girl, who you trying to fool?

04:25.478 --> 04:26.945
Alley-oop, dad.

04:26.980 --> 04:30.438
Boy. New neighbors.

04:30.483 --> 04:31.472
Really?

04:35.422 --> 04:38.880
See, Quincy, this is how
your moms caught me.

04:38.925 --> 04:41.257
With the old fake and bake.

04:41.294 --> 04:44.263
Thought I was catching
a sister who could burn.

04:48.668 --> 04:50.363
I can't do this shit.

04:52.939 --> 04:54.998
Boy, what did I tell you
about using that word?

04:58.411 --> 05:00.606
"Can't" should never be
in a man's vocabulary.

05:00.647 --> 05:01.909
And why not?

05:01.948 --> 05:03.939
'Cause when you say "can't",
you ain't a man.

05:03.984 --> 05:06.248
- That's right.
- Zeke.

05:06.286 --> 05:08.618
What? Oh, yeah.

05:08.655 --> 05:11.021
Don't say shit.

05:11.057 --> 05:13.321
Come on.
We should head on over.

05:13.360 --> 05:15.726
Just you and Quincy, baby.
I got a meeting.

05:15.762 --> 05:17.992
- With who?
- Some business folks.

05:18.031 --> 05:20.898
You just got back
from a four-game road trip.

05:20.934 --> 05:22.765
Nona, please don't
start bitching.

05:22.802 --> 05:25.202
I got maybe
two years left to play.

05:25.238 --> 05:27.331
I'm trying to put
some things together for us.

05:28.808 --> 05:30.776
See you later, man.

05:30.810 --> 05:33.176
Be good. I love you.

05:33.213 --> 05:34.202
I love you, Dad.

05:35.715 --> 05:37.649
So how long
have y'all been here?

05:37.684 --> 05:40.517
We moved back here
when Quince was about five...

05:40.553 --> 05:42.282
after Zeke was traded again.

05:42.322 --> 05:44.620
The neighborhood was
a little more mixed then.

05:44.658 --> 05:47.183
Before the black people
down the street...

05:47.227 --> 05:50.754
became the black people
next-door. OK?

05:53.500 --> 05:56.060
Thank you so much again.

05:56.102 --> 05:58.036
This was terribly
nice of you, Nona.

05:58.071 --> 05:59.470
Girl, don't worry about it.

05:59.506 --> 06:02.202
It's the least I could do.
I love to cook.

06:02.242 --> 06:06.303
You do? I cook for my friends'
parties back in Atlanta.

06:06.346 --> 06:08.906
You're a caterer?

06:08.948 --> 06:11.143
No. Once Nathan
gets settled in, though...

06:11.184 --> 06:12.913
and the girls
are a little older...

06:12.952 --> 06:15.045
that's certainly something
Mom would like to try.

06:15.088 --> 06:18.854
Do you know as long as
I have lived next-door...

06:18.892 --> 06:20.553
I have never seen
the inside of this house?

06:20.593 --> 06:22.720
Let's just have a look.

06:22.762 --> 06:25.526
Honey, put that
on the table for mom.

06:25.565 --> 06:26.930
Quince, help her.

06:34.741 --> 06:37.676
So how come you
can play basketball?

06:37.711 --> 06:39.008
I just can.

06:39.045 --> 06:41.275
I never knew
a girl that can play.

06:41.314 --> 06:44.044
Momma says she doesn't
know why I act different.

06:44.084 --> 06:46.917
- Your dad play?
- He works at a bank.

06:46.953 --> 06:48.420
My dad plays for the Clippers.

06:48.455 --> 06:50.480
He says I'm gonna be
a doctor or a lawyer...

06:50.523 --> 06:53.549
but I'm gonna play for them.
Same number and everything.

06:53.593 --> 06:56.084
I'm gonna be number 32,
like Magic.

06:56.129 --> 06:58.996
He's all right.
My dad can take him.

06:59.032 --> 07:01.364
What was the most points
you daddy ever got?

07:01.401 --> 07:03.266
I don't know. A lot.

07:03.303 --> 07:05.828
Well, one game,
Magic scored 48 points...

07:05.872 --> 07:07.863
they only had
six-minute quarters...

07:07.907 --> 07:10.068
and he sat out
the whole fourth quarter.

07:11.077 --> 07:13.944
- You do act different.
- I don't care.

07:13.980 --> 07:15.948
If anybody messes with you...

07:15.982 --> 07:18.450
just let me know,
'cause I run this street.

07:18.485 --> 07:20.112
I'll tell my sister Lena.

07:20.153 --> 07:22.121
She don't know how to box.

07:22.155 --> 07:25.352
My dad taught me
how to fight like Ali.

07:25.391 --> 07:28.417
I know karate
from Almighty Isis.

07:28.461 --> 07:30.258
Bet you can't do this, though.

07:35.068 --> 07:38.003
How about this?

07:42.742 --> 07:44.232
Monica. Sit still.

07:44.277 --> 07:46.336
And don't sit
on your knees, sweetie.

07:46.379 --> 07:48.210
You're gonna turn them black.

07:50.550 --> 07:52.814
You are lucky I found it.

07:52.852 --> 07:55.480
Someone had put
your box of dresses...

07:55.522 --> 07:58.753
underneath a pile of rags
in the garage.

08:01.728 --> 08:04.595
- You OK?
- Yeah. I need to lay down.

08:04.631 --> 08:06.155
I've been running around
all day.

08:06.199 --> 08:08.793
Honey, which one
of these for tomorrow?

08:08.835 --> 08:12.999
- Blue stripe.
- You sure?

08:13.039 --> 08:16.065
You want to iron them both?
Just in case.

08:16.109 --> 08:18.942
- Sure.
- Thanks, sweetie.

08:22.048 --> 08:24.516
That boy next-door will ride
to school with you tomorrow.

08:24.551 --> 08:26.781
You'll know somebody.

08:26.820 --> 08:29.812
Hurry up. I'll come
back up for good nights.

08:32.058 --> 08:34.525
Make it look nice, OK?

10:01.080 --> 10:02.638
You want to be my girl?

10:04.751 --> 10:07.345
What do I have to do?

10:07.387 --> 10:11.483
I guess we can play ball
and ride to school together.

10:11.524 --> 10:14.493
When you get mad at me,
I got to give you flowers.

10:14.527 --> 10:16.927
But I don't like flowers.

10:19.732 --> 10:22.758
How about Twinkies?
My mom won't ever buy them.

10:28.608 --> 10:30.371
I think we ought to kiss now.

10:30.410 --> 10:32.742
For how long?

10:32.779 --> 10:34.269
Five seconds?

10:34.314 --> 10:36.111
Not out here.

10:39.152 --> 10:40.244
Over there, then.

11:02.642 --> 11:04.109
Ready?

11:27.266 --> 11:28.426
Wait.

11:28.468 --> 11:30.561
'Cause you my girl,
you got to ride on my bike.

11:30.603 --> 11:32.400
I want to ride my own bike.

11:32.438 --> 11:35.100
- My dad always drives my mom.
- So?

11:35.141 --> 11:37.507
That means I have to ride you.

11:37.543 --> 11:39.704
Come on.

11:39.746 --> 11:41.771
I don't have to do what you say.

11:41.814 --> 11:44.408
Forget you, then, stupid.

11:44.450 --> 11:47.317
You stupid, and your dad plays
for the worst team in the NBA.

11:47.353 --> 11:48.615
What?

11:48.654 --> 11:51.179
Last time they won,
Dr. J was a nurse.

11:51.224 --> 11:52.316
Shut up!

11:52.358 --> 11:54.849
I don't want to be
your boyfriend, you ugly dog.

11:54.894 --> 11:57.795
I don't want to be
your girlfriend, big head.

12:07.407 --> 12:09.602
Get off me!

12:09.642 --> 12:11.132
Big head.

12:46.546 --> 13:04.386
Hey, Q.

13:04.430 --> 13:06.762
Play some "D"!

13:15.842 --> 13:17.901
Technical foul.

13:17.944 --> 13:19.036
For what?

13:19.078 --> 13:22.104
Damn! Come on, get in.

13:22.148 --> 13:23.740
Let it go.

13:23.783 --> 13:26.217
Unsportsmanlike conduct, white.

13:26.252 --> 13:28.686
- For what?
- Technical foul.

13:28.721 --> 13:31.212
- Man, you suck!
- Two shots.

13:31.257 --> 13:32.656
Sit down and shut up.

13:36.996 --> 13:37.985
Let it go. She feels better.

13:38.030 --> 13:40.396
Oh, please.
She's behaving horribly.

13:43.503 --> 13:45.130
I'm out.

13:55.748 --> 13:58.182
I need a sub.

13:58.217 --> 14:00.014
Karinda, sub, sub, sub.

14:10.329 --> 14:13.389
Dad, you got to talk
to coach for me.

14:13.432 --> 14:15.400
What am I supposed
to say to the man?

14:15.434 --> 14:18.164
Tell him to keep me
on the floor.

14:18.204 --> 14:20.297
The coach
from UCLA was there.

14:20.339 --> 14:21.806
He has me riding the bench.

14:21.841 --> 14:25.038
- You lost your head.
- I was showing emotion.

14:25.077 --> 14:27.409
So it's all right
for you to act like that?

14:27.446 --> 14:28.913
Whatever.

14:28.948 --> 14:31.416
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

14:31.450 --> 14:33.384
I don't know why
I keep hoping...

14:33.419 --> 14:35.250
you'll grow out
of this tomboy thing.

14:35.288 --> 14:38.280
I won't. I'm a lesbian.

14:38.324 --> 14:40.315
That's not funny.

14:40.359 --> 14:41.621
That's what you think...

14:41.661 --> 14:43.561
'cause I'd rather wear
a jersey than an apron?

14:43.596 --> 14:45.063
Please.

14:45.097 --> 14:48.464
Monica, I think what
your mother is saying is...

14:50.503 --> 14:51.834
Maybe it's time
you start thinking

14:51.871 --> 14:53.930
about other things
beside basketball.

14:55.208 --> 14:56.266
What?

14:56.309 --> 14:59.972
One game left and
you haven't been recruited.

15:00.012 --> 15:02.003
Munchkin, I wanted this
as bad as you did...

15:02.048 --> 15:04.312
but we have to face reality.

15:04.350 --> 15:07.808
The coach from USC
will be at the championship.

15:07.853 --> 15:09.821
I know, but chances are...

15:09.855 --> 15:12.824
Chances are
there's still a chance.

15:13.993 --> 15:16.427
If you would just listen
to someone for a change...

15:16.462 --> 15:19.761
you'd realize you have a lot
going for yourself.

15:19.799 --> 15:21.630
You're smart.

15:21.667 --> 15:24.898
You would be pretty if you'd
do something with your hair.

15:24.937 --> 15:27.167
I don't know why you run around
with your hair looking like...

15:27.206 --> 15:30.141
"Who shot John
and forgot to kill him."

15:30.176 --> 15:32.542
You'd be real pleasant-looking
if you'd smile.

15:32.578 --> 15:36.344
My mom's about to be home.

15:36.382 --> 15:38.907
I'm not good enough
to meet your moms?

15:38.951 --> 15:40.179
Now, girl.

15:40.219 --> 15:43.848
If my moms knew I had a hottie
like you up in the crib...

15:43.889 --> 15:45.789
she would beat
the black off of me.

15:53.866 --> 15:56.391
That's a lot of beatin'.

16:47.787 --> 16:49.550
Hey, girl.

16:51.157 --> 16:53.887
Your hair looks
really cute like that.

16:53.926 --> 16:55.188
Thanks.

16:55.227 --> 16:58.253
So, do you know who Q is asking
to the spring dance?

16:58.297 --> 16:59.764
Nope.

16:59.799 --> 17:01.391
Come on, girl.
You live right next-door.

17:01.434 --> 17:04.300
Just tell me
who's been creeping.

17:04.337 --> 17:07.101
There's just so many,
I can't keep track.

17:09.208 --> 17:12.371
Can you give him this for me?
Please?

17:12.411 --> 17:13.810
Give it yourself.

17:13.846 --> 17:15.711
I'm not trying
to look all fast.

17:18.818 --> 17:20.285
Thanks, girl.

17:24.589 --> 17:26.454
Good lord, look at that booty.

17:27.760 --> 17:29.625
I want to lick the sweat off.

17:46.011 --> 17:49.071
Quincy, so help me out.
Where's it gonna be?

17:49.115 --> 17:51.242
I'll see you at
the press conference, baby.

17:51.283 --> 17:53.979
Four years, I've been
writing about your son.

17:54.019 --> 17:57.011
Did that cover story on you two
in "Sunday Magazine."

17:57.056 --> 17:59.524
You'd love for him to play
at USC like you, right?

17:59.558 --> 18:01.458
No, I'd love for him
to get a good education.

18:01.494 --> 18:02.984
See you at
the press conference.

18:03.028 --> 18:04.256
Fine. Blow me off.

18:04.296 --> 18:06.196
Never like that, baby.

18:10.336 --> 18:13.271
We should have another talk
with Coach Carile of Princeton.

18:13.305 --> 18:14.863
Come on, Pop.

18:14.907 --> 18:17.637
There's no way an lvy League
team will go all the way.

18:17.676 --> 18:19.234
I don't care about
the team, Quincy.

18:19.278 --> 18:20.836
I care about the school.

18:20.880 --> 18:25.476
Didn't we have
this conversation already?

18:25.518 --> 18:26.712
Right.

18:28.487 --> 18:31.285
You played a good game today.
I was proud of you.

18:31.323 --> 18:34.224
Thanks, man.
You up for a game later?

18:34.260 --> 18:35.955
I don't want to hurt
your feelings now.

18:35.995 --> 18:37.553
You don't want
to hurt that back.

18:37.596 --> 18:40.861
I gotta bend down low
to guard you.

18:40.900 --> 18:43.198
Anyway, I gotta get
to this meeting...

18:43.235 --> 18:45.135
so tell your mom
I'm gonna be late.

18:45.171 --> 18:46.729
Don't work too hard.

18:46.772 --> 18:49.935
Let's hope I can say
the same about you someday.

18:49.975 --> 18:50.942
I love you, bro.

18:50.976 --> 18:52.876
- I love you, too.
- Be cool.

18:52.912 --> 18:55.437
Hey, what's up, man?

18:59.251 --> 19:00.411
Thank you.

19:01.921 --> 19:02.888
Hey, Mr. M.

19:02.922 --> 19:05.015
Hey, Miss Baller.
Excuse me, ladies.

19:08.727 --> 19:10.991
- Way to hoop.
- I know this.

19:11.030 --> 19:14.488
- What you want?
- A ride home.

19:14.533 --> 19:15.727
Your legs don't look broke.

19:15.768 --> 19:18.794
Look, big head,
I'll be at your car.

19:18.838 --> 19:20.772
I guess "Please"
would be a stretch?

19:20.806 --> 19:22.467
Please.

19:25.010 --> 19:27.604
Don't touch the radio,
all right?

19:27.646 --> 19:30.376
Just appreciate
the ride home.

19:30.416 --> 19:32.179
Have a little respect
for a man's car.

19:32.218 --> 19:33.845
Put something on.

19:33.886 --> 19:37.185
No, I like going home
in silence after the game.

19:37.223 --> 19:40.317
Thinking about how good
I look shootin' that three.

19:40.359 --> 19:42.122
Don't flatter yourself.

19:44.497 --> 19:45.555
What's that?

19:45.598 --> 19:48.465
Some note Shawnee Easton
told me to give you.

19:48.501 --> 19:51.834
Shawnee Easton.

19:51.871 --> 19:53.361
With the bigass titties?

19:53.405 --> 19:54.838
Hey, give it here!

19:54.874 --> 19:56.398
Give it here!

20:02.781 --> 20:05.807
"Q, you are so fine.

20:05.851 --> 20:07.978
"I've been wanting
to get with you.

20:08.020 --> 20:09.749
"Let me take you
to the spring dance...

20:09.788 --> 20:12.814
and I promise
I'll leave you satisfied."

20:14.760 --> 20:15.920
What a ho.

20:15.961 --> 20:19.556
Why she gotta be a ho
'cause she wanna get with me?

20:19.598 --> 20:22.897
She's a ho because she's sends
her coochie through the mail.

20:22.935 --> 20:25.028
And?

20:25.070 --> 20:27.004
She's not saying,
"I think you're a nice guy...

20:27.039 --> 20:28.529
and I want to get
to know you better."

20:28.574 --> 20:30.804
She's saying, "I wanna bone."

20:30.843 --> 20:32.674
She's honest.

20:32.711 --> 20:34.736
An honest, tramp-ass ho.

20:36.515 --> 20:39.279
But then I guess you'll stick
your thing in anything.

20:39.318 --> 20:41.218
My thing?

20:42.254 --> 20:43.949
I didn't know you cared so much.

20:43.989 --> 20:45.752
I don't.

20:45.791 --> 20:50.660
So, who you going
to the dance with, anyway?

20:50.696 --> 20:51.685
Spalding?

20:51.730 --> 20:53.197
Who's Spalding?

20:58.337 --> 20:59.668
- See?
- Stupid!

20:59.705 --> 21:01.696
That's why you ain't
getting recruited.

21:01.740 --> 21:03.503
Who said I'm not
getting recruited?

21:03.542 --> 21:05.066
Your hot-ass temper,
that's who.

21:05.110 --> 21:08.546
I'm not the one
who put this scar here...

21:08.581 --> 21:11.607
when we were 11-years-old
'cause he was about to lose.

21:11.650 --> 21:14.517
You know what?

21:14.553 --> 21:16.350
Give me your best shot.

21:16.388 --> 21:18.083
Give me your best shot.
I'm sick of...

21:18.123 --> 21:19.750
Would you watch the damn road?

21:19.792 --> 21:22.022
I am. I'm sick of you
hanging this over my head.

21:22.061 --> 21:23.323
Give me your best shot.

21:23.362 --> 21:26.456
Don't tempt me.
I'm warning you.

21:26.498 --> 21:27.760
I'm warning you.

21:27.800 --> 21:32.066
You don't store that attitude,
no one will recruit you.

21:32.104 --> 21:33.537
Please.

21:33.572 --> 21:37.440
You jump in some guy's face,
you talk smack...

21:37.476 --> 21:39.410
and you get a pat on your ass.

21:39.445 --> 21:41.436
But because I'm a female...

21:41.480 --> 21:44.108
I get told to calm down
and act like a lady.

21:44.149 --> 21:46.344
I'm a ballplayer.

21:49.054 --> 21:50.851
With a jacked-up attitude.

21:50.889 --> 21:53.483
Didn't know you cared so much.

21:53.525 --> 21:55.425
I really don't.

21:55.461 --> 21:56.485
Good.

22:01.500 --> 22:03.798
I'm home! What's up, Mom?

22:03.836 --> 22:05.235
What is this?

22:05.270 --> 22:08.239
That's your earring.

22:11.310 --> 22:13.005
I look like
some hoochie to you?

22:13.045 --> 22:15.946
I found it on your bed.

22:15.981 --> 22:17.073
What you doing in my room?

22:17.116 --> 22:20.813
I have told you about
these fast-ass girls.

22:20.853 --> 22:22.150
We were just studying.

22:22.187 --> 22:24.678
Boy, I'm not playing with you.

22:24.723 --> 22:26.850
These girls are looking
to get you caught.

22:26.892 --> 22:29.087
They see you,
and they see dollar signs.

22:29.128 --> 22:30.595
I know.

22:30.629 --> 22:31.891
Are you hearing me?

22:31.930 --> 22:32.919
I'm hearing you.

22:32.965 --> 22:34.455
No. Are you hearing me?

22:34.500 --> 22:36.092
I've been hearing you, Mom.

22:41.240 --> 22:42.935
How was your game?

22:42.975 --> 22:47.912
27 points, 11 assists,
still undefeated.

22:47.946 --> 22:49.413
Still the man.

22:49.448 --> 22:50.881
You know that.

22:50.916 --> 22:52.315
Where's your dad?

22:52.351 --> 22:54.444
He said he'd be home later.

22:54.486 --> 22:56.078
Later when?

22:56.121 --> 22:58.988
I don't know.
He had a meeting.

22:59.024 --> 23:00.685
At 1:00 in the morning?

23:00.726 --> 23:03.889
I'm not getting anywhere
by punching a clock

23:03.929 --> 23:06.420
just so my wife
doesn't get an attitude.

23:06.465 --> 23:08.160
I came second to the NBA.

23:08.200 --> 23:12.330
I'm not about to come second
to no bullshit scouting job.

23:14.506 --> 23:16.371
I didn't mean it like that.

23:19.244 --> 23:22.111
Zeke, all I'm saying
is that it would be nice...

23:22.147 --> 23:23.876
if you found time
for your family.

23:23.916 --> 23:25.747
You should see the tramps
coming after Quincy.

23:25.784 --> 23:27.217
If you don't talk to him...

23:27.252 --> 23:28.310
I have.

23:30.022 --> 23:32.991
You said you'd think about
going back to get your degree.

23:33.025 --> 23:36.324
You said
I should get my degree.

23:36.361 --> 23:38.795
I like my bullshit job.

23:38.831 --> 23:40.890
And it's gonna lead to
a front-office position.

23:40.933 --> 23:42.366
Until then, don't worry.

23:42.401 --> 23:43.834
We got just enough savings...

23:43.869 --> 23:46.303
to keep your fine ass
in Gucci and gold.

23:49.808 --> 23:51.435
How many nights does
my fine ass get...

23:51.477 --> 23:52.444
Damn you!

23:52.478 --> 23:55.379
What about now?
Do I get a week yet?

23:55.414 --> 23:57.473
- Keep your voice down!
- Keep your ass home!

25:16.628 --> 25:17.617
Coming to my game?

25:17.663 --> 25:19.961
You know that,
but I got finals tomorrow...

25:19.998 --> 25:21.693
so I gotta leave at halftime.

25:21.733 --> 25:24.998
You can't leave at halftime.
It's the championship.

25:25.037 --> 25:31.704
I know, but I got a cutie
coming over to help me study.

25:31.743 --> 25:35.577
What's going on
with you and the spring dance?

25:35.614 --> 25:39.243
You got a date yet?

25:39.284 --> 25:41.980
Yeah. Brothers are
lined up at my locker.

25:44.289 --> 25:45.881
I found you someone.

25:45.924 --> 25:49.155
Found?
I'm not some charity case.

25:49.194 --> 25:50.923
Ma tell you to do that?

25:50.963 --> 25:53.864
- No, she did not.
- Damn, Lena.

25:56.535 --> 25:58.162
Who is he?

25:58.203 --> 26:01.195
This brother from my college.

26:01.240 --> 26:03.640
He's in college?

26:03.675 --> 26:06.701
And he is fine, girl.

26:06.745 --> 26:08.770
How'd you get him to say yes?

26:08.814 --> 26:11.783
I told him you looked like me.

26:11.817 --> 26:12.806
Great.

26:12.851 --> 26:15.820
- Monica, you do.
- Yeah, right.

26:15.854 --> 26:19.085
If you were tore up,
I would not be claiming you.

26:19.124 --> 26:21.149
Trust.

26:21.193 --> 26:24.128
We're gonna do something cute
with your hair...

26:24.162 --> 26:27.359
get you in a nice, sexy dress,
some heels.

26:27.399 --> 26:29.367
I don't know
how to walk in heels.

26:29.401 --> 26:32.165
You just worry about
playing your heart out...

26:32.204 --> 26:33.432
for that recruiter tonight.

26:33.472 --> 26:37.169
You let your big sister
worry about your date.

26:39.077 --> 26:40.669
You ever been in love?

26:40.712 --> 26:43.180
Too many times.

26:45.484 --> 26:46.746
They ever love you back?

26:49.354 --> 26:50.844
Once I cut 'em off.

26:53.558 --> 26:54.718
Why?

27:17.049 --> 27:19.540
I don't have to tell you girls
how big this game is.

27:19.584 --> 27:22.815
We worked too damn hard not to
take the championship with us.

27:22.854 --> 27:27.223
So we're gonna play smart
and with control...

27:27.259 --> 27:29.887
and we're gonna kick some butt.

27:29.928 --> 27:31.327
Captain!

27:31.363 --> 27:35.163
- Whose house?
- C-house!

27:35.200 --> 27:37.168
- C...
- House!

27:37.202 --> 27:38.430
Lady Cougars on three.

27:38.470 --> 27:40.938
One, two, three, Lady Cougars!

27:40.973 --> 27:45.342
Come on, now. Come on!

27:45.377 --> 27:49.006
Crenshaw Cougars!

27:49.047 --> 27:52.676
Crenshaw! Crenshaw!

28:15.173 --> 28:18.006
Green! White!

28:26.818 --> 28:29.651
44 spread, 44.

28:29.688 --> 28:31.713
Down 4, you got this.

28:31.757 --> 28:33.156
What you got, baby?

28:33.191 --> 28:35.159
Don't get tight.
She's laying off.

28:35.193 --> 28:36.217
Pull up.

28:42.034 --> 28:43.001
Down one, down one.

28:43.035 --> 28:44.900
Come on, D-up, Mon.

28:44.936 --> 28:46.836
Watch the ball.

28:46.872 --> 28:48.931
Watch the ball. Now.

28:48.974 --> 28:50.498
Bonus.

28:50.542 --> 28:51.668
Toss up. Take it right.

28:51.710 --> 28:53.769
Watch your left!

28:54.880 --> 28:56.848
All right, watch your left!

28:56.882 --> 28:58.110
Up one.

28:58.150 --> 29:00.252
D-up, Mon.

29:00.252 --> 29:02.152
Come on. Play smart.

29:02.187 --> 29:03.848
Up one. Play smart.
You got this.

29:03.889 --> 29:06.255
Play smart. Play smart.

29:06.291 --> 29:08.782
I got this. Play smart.

29:08.827 --> 29:10.795
Don't put that out there.

29:10.829 --> 29:13.024
- What?
- Reaching in.

29:13.065 --> 29:16.865
No! Come on, ref.

29:18.670 --> 29:21.935
White, 3-2... reaching in.
One and one.

29:21.973 --> 29:23.497
Bull!

29:24.776 --> 29:26.505
Let it go.

29:34.586 --> 29:37.282
It's all right.
Just get it back.

29:45.197 --> 29:46.892
One shot.

29:54.739 --> 29:56.536
Let's go, Monica.
Take this all the way.

30:01.213 --> 30:02.510
It's all you, Mon.

30:02.547 --> 30:04.913
Let's go.
Come on, come on, Mon.

30:04.950 --> 30:06.577
Get there.
You just need to get there.

30:06.618 --> 30:08.984
Come on, you need this.

30:09.020 --> 30:10.248
Please.

30:16.628 --> 30:20.997
Foul, foul, foul!

30:21.032 --> 30:22.158
Holding.

30:22.200 --> 30:23.724
That's five.

30:29.574 --> 30:30.598
That's OK.

30:39.417 --> 30:41.044
You played hard.

30:41.086 --> 30:42.178
It's all right, Monica.

31:04.709 --> 31:07.678
It might help
if you didn't look so evil.

31:07.712 --> 31:10.875
I don't even want to go.

31:27.532 --> 31:29.625
Talk to me.

31:29.668 --> 31:33.263
Go look in my top drawer
and bring Grandmother's pearls.

31:41.947 --> 31:44.142
Tonight...

31:44.182 --> 31:47.174
don't worry
about yesterday's game...

31:47.219 --> 31:52.054
or the recruiters
or anything else.

31:52.090 --> 31:55.856
I just want you
to enjoy being beautiful.

31:58.597 --> 32:00.656
Will you do that?

32:00.699 --> 32:02.997
Here you go, Ma.

32:03.034 --> 32:05.025
Thanks, sweetie.

32:16.014 --> 32:18.949
Do you really think
I'm beautiful?

32:20.552 --> 32:22.383
Honey, hush.

33:39.464 --> 33:41.364
Can I take your coat?

33:41.399 --> 33:43.663
You're cold?

33:43.702 --> 33:46.865
No. I mean,
I can check it for you.

33:46.905 --> 33:49.430
Sorry.

33:54.079 --> 33:57.048
Your sister wasn't lying.

34:12.797 --> 34:16.289
Damn. Hold up.

34:26.043 --> 34:29.605
Well, I see you made it.

34:29.647 --> 34:32.844
You don't look half bad.

34:32.884 --> 34:34.875
You, either.

34:39.224 --> 34:42.455
What's up, black? Jason.

34:48.733 --> 34:51.668
Damn, girl.
I didn't know Nike made dresses.

34:57.742 --> 34:59.676
Guess we'll see you later.

35:13.024 --> 35:15.015
So, you like school?

35:17.028 --> 35:18.996
High school was cool.

35:19.030 --> 35:23.694
I don't remember the sisters
being as find as you, though.

35:27.205 --> 35:28.900
Girl, how come
you're so stressed?

35:28.940 --> 35:30.771
Sorry.

35:30.809 --> 35:33.004
No. I'm having
a good time with you.

35:33.044 --> 35:37.504
So what I do have to do
to make you have a good time?

35:42.287 --> 35:45.188
My mouth is kind of dry.

35:45.223 --> 35:47.088
Then I'll get you some punch.

35:48.393 --> 35:51.885
Don't jet while I'm gone and
leave a glass slipper behind.

35:53.531 --> 35:55.556
There we go.

36:04.476 --> 36:06.307
Oh, man.

36:13.852 --> 36:16.013
You having fun?

36:16.054 --> 36:18.614
Damn d.j. Is fresh.

36:18.656 --> 36:21.056
Who is this clown?

36:21.092 --> 36:23.526
He ain't Spalding.

36:23.561 --> 36:26.530
Guess not.

36:26.564 --> 36:28.555
So, you took Shawnee, huh?

36:28.600 --> 36:32.366
It was late. She asked.

36:32.403 --> 36:35.338
You want to dance?

36:36.374 --> 36:38.535
Sure.

39:42.360 --> 39:43.725
What?

39:54.005 --> 39:56.371
Early night for you,
isn't it?

39:56.407 --> 39:58.500
Should be
asking you the same...

39:58.543 --> 40:02.035
after your big date
with college boy and all.

40:02.080 --> 40:03.877
Where'd y'all go after?

40:03.915 --> 40:06.884
- Mulholland Drive.
- Figures.

40:06.918 --> 40:09.250
So, what dead-end street
did you and Shawnee hit?

40:09.287 --> 40:11.482
None of your business.

40:11.522 --> 40:15.686
I'm sure she kept her word
and left you satisfied.

40:15.727 --> 40:17.558
That's what you think, huh?

40:18.863 --> 40:22.196
After you left, I told Shawnee
it was time to go...

40:22.233 --> 40:23.791
drove her ass straight home.

40:23.835 --> 40:25.359
After she told me...

40:25.403 --> 40:29.134
I was the dumbest brother
in the world, I took off.

40:30.408 --> 40:33.741
I was sitting in
Jason's ride with him...

40:35.079 --> 40:39.573
And he was kissing on me
and feeling on me and...

40:39.617 --> 40:41.710
It was really bugging me,
'cause I couldn't remember

40:41.753 --> 40:45.120
how many offensive boards
I had in the championship.

40:47.391 --> 40:49.222
And then I guess
he got sort of tired of me...

40:49.260 --> 40:52.423
"accidentally"
Kneeing him in the balls.

40:58.436 --> 41:01.269
- Four.
- What?

41:01.305 --> 41:04.035
You had four
offensive rebounds.

41:10.515 --> 41:12.608
Hold up a second.

41:21.926 --> 41:23.621
What's up?

41:24.962 --> 41:26.361
USC.

41:26.397 --> 41:29.127
It was on my desk
when I came home.

41:29.167 --> 41:30.600
What you waiting for?

41:30.635 --> 41:32.603
Can you...?

41:32.637 --> 41:34.764
You sure?

41:34.806 --> 41:36.467
All right.

41:43.648 --> 41:44.910
What?

41:44.949 --> 41:47.247
Damn, girl.

41:51.155 --> 41:52.486
They want you.

42:03.768 --> 42:06.032
And guess what.

42:06.070 --> 42:07.230
Guess what.

42:07.271 --> 42:08.431
What?

42:08.472 --> 42:10.667
I'm going, too.

42:10.708 --> 42:12.972
They're announcing it
tomorrow.

42:13.010 --> 42:16.707
I knew it.

42:20.051 --> 42:22.679
Congratulations.

42:27.825 --> 42:29.952
What was that about?

42:29.994 --> 42:32.121
I don't know, all right?

43:37.628 --> 43:39.619
Come on.

45:40.918 --> 45:42.909
Wait a minute.

46:24.595 --> 46:26.358
Want me to stop?

46:45.349 --> 46:48.443
Let's go, freshman.
You're getting spanked!

46:56.160 --> 46:58.628
Point guards lead from
the front, not the back.

47:04.802 --> 47:05.826
Come on, girl.

47:05.870 --> 47:07.531
You took her out.

47:07.571 --> 47:09.198
Girl, you need your mama?

47:09.240 --> 47:10.366
Do you need a hug?

47:10.407 --> 47:13.240
Are you telling me
you can't take a little charge?

47:13.277 --> 47:14.710
I can take it.

47:14.745 --> 47:16.508
Get your feet set this time.

47:16.547 --> 47:17.536
Go.

47:21.519 --> 47:23.487
Next.

47:23.521 --> 47:25.489
Let's go. Move it!

47:25.523 --> 47:26.785
Way to work it. Good job.

47:26.824 --> 47:29.088
Lower, Monica,
move your feet!

47:29.126 --> 47:30.957
I said lower!

47:30.995 --> 47:32.860
Monica, this is low.

47:32.897 --> 47:34.387
This is low. You got it?

47:34.431 --> 47:36.558
Offense sells tickets.
Defense wins games.

47:36.600 --> 47:38.591
Back to the line, everybody.
Let's go!

47:38.636 --> 47:42.538
Hustle up! Move it!
Come on, get a move on.

47:51.015 --> 47:54.451
You got it. Come on, lift.

47:54.485 --> 47:56.112
That's it.

47:56.153 --> 47:58.883
Coach hates me, doesn't she?

47:58.923 --> 48:01.790
She hates all freshman.

48:01.825 --> 48:04.521
What is up with that?

48:04.562 --> 48:06.530
Don't take it personally.

48:06.564 --> 48:09.192
Don't think just because
we play the same position...

48:09.233 --> 48:10.962
we have to compete
with each other.

48:11.001 --> 48:13.834
We're teammates, OK?

48:13.871 --> 48:15.930
Thanks, Sidra.

48:15.973 --> 48:20.376
Besides, I've been starting
point the last two years.

48:20.411 --> 48:24.814
Ain't no way some soft-ass
freshman is taking my spot.

48:29.553 --> 48:31.817
Damn, Sid.

48:31.855 --> 48:34.085
You're all right, fresh.
Come on.

48:40.197 --> 48:43.394
You finish
your reading for Econ?

48:43.434 --> 48:44.924
What it say?

48:44.969 --> 48:46.994
Basically, it broke down...

48:47.037 --> 48:48.902
how I'm gonna make
mad loot in the NBA...

48:48.939 --> 48:50.873
being I'm such
a limited commodity.

48:50.908 --> 48:53.342
Whatever, big head.

48:53.377 --> 48:56.676
Q-man, you gonna take us
to the final 4?

48:56.714 --> 48:57.908
We'll see.

48:57.948 --> 49:00.542
- I'll be watching.
- Hope so.

49:03.754 --> 49:05.381
What?

49:05.422 --> 49:07.356
You do see me
standing here, right?

49:07.391 --> 49:09.655
I can't be nice to a fan?

49:09.693 --> 49:12.526
Fine, Quincy.

49:12.563 --> 49:15.532
I can't help it
if girls come up to me.

49:15.566 --> 49:16.760
I said fine.

49:16.800 --> 49:19.769
Oh, little baby.

49:22.673 --> 49:25.039
What you doing? Quit.

49:25.075 --> 49:27.805
Daddy's here.

49:27.845 --> 49:29.574
You're such a punk.

49:31.248 --> 49:33.876
All these girls...

49:33.917 --> 49:36.579
you're the only one
I know who's for real.

49:39.089 --> 49:41.080
I love you, too.

49:45.863 --> 49:48.593
All right now.
Hustle back! Hustle back!

49:53.103 --> 49:54.570
Get that, Shay!

49:54.605 --> 49:56.334
Nice shot!

49:56.373 --> 49:58.739
Stay with her.

49:58.776 --> 50:01.404
Monica, get up on her.

50:01.445 --> 50:02.935
Stay on her.

50:05.449 --> 50:06.575
That's it.

50:06.617 --> 50:08.107
You got it.

50:09.520 --> 50:11.511
Ball!

50:11.555 --> 50:13.022
All right, now. Push it up!

50:13.057 --> 50:14.854
You got help.

50:14.892 --> 50:16.917
Be active, Sidra.
Don't reach.

50:16.960 --> 50:18.427
Cut, Mon, cut!

50:19.630 --> 50:21.097
Shot!

50:21.131 --> 50:22.098
Yeah, girl!

50:22.132 --> 50:24.123
Sidra, feel like playing
any "D"?

50:24.168 --> 50:26.159
Let's get back.

50:26.203 --> 50:28.228
Stay balanced. Move your feet.

50:29.573 --> 50:31.438
Nice steal.

50:31.475 --> 50:33.136
You're by yourself!

50:36.814 --> 50:38.281
Heads up!

50:40.351 --> 50:41.716
Whose net?

50:41.752 --> 50:43.310
Yeah, girl.

50:52.596 --> 50:54.723
While you're so busy posing,
your man just scored.

50:56.867 --> 51:00.462
- Show me again.
- What?

51:00.504 --> 51:03.667
You like to pose so much,
let's see it again.

51:03.707 --> 51:05.299
You think I'm funny?

51:12.916 --> 51:15.680
Stand like that
for the rest of practice.

51:15.719 --> 51:18.347
I want you to stand like that
so you get sick of it...

51:18.389 --> 51:19.686
because I don't want
to see it again.

51:19.723 --> 51:21.213
Do you hear me?

51:21.258 --> 51:22.725
That's right.

51:24.061 --> 51:26.188
Dora, take her place.

51:26.230 --> 51:27.959
Better step off the court.

51:34.138 --> 51:36.572
Nice pass.

51:39.243 --> 51:40.938
What was up
with practice today?

51:40.978 --> 51:42.104
She tried to kill us.

51:42.146 --> 51:44.080
Can you hook me up
with some socks, please.

51:44.114 --> 51:45.513
I need my socks back.

51:45.549 --> 51:47.244
What am I,
the sock lady or something?

51:53.791 --> 51:56.988
That's what you get for trying
to show out, freshman.

51:57.027 --> 51:58.187
I was just playing ball.

51:58.228 --> 52:00.297
You were trying
to make me look bad.

52:00.297 --> 52:02.197
I didn't have
to try very hard.

52:05.169 --> 52:08.570
Girl, don't you know
you just sloppy seconds?

52:11.275 --> 52:12.833
Sidra, let it go.

52:12.876 --> 52:14.241
The only reason you here...

52:14.278 --> 52:17.611
is Tanya Randall got pregnant
and decided not to come.

52:17.648 --> 52:20.276
They were done recruiting.

52:23.353 --> 52:24.945
That's cold, Sid.

52:24.988 --> 52:27.479
Just thought
the girl should know.

52:30.994 --> 52:32.689
Don't even trip, Mon.

52:32.729 --> 52:35.960
She's just mad
'cause she's bowlegged.

52:39.236 --> 52:41.761
Forget Tanya Randall.

52:41.805 --> 52:45.673
Coach wishes
she was here instead of me.

52:45.709 --> 52:48.109
So prove her wrong.

52:48.145 --> 52:51.137
I don't have it easy
like you, all right?

52:51.181 --> 52:54.344
There's no red carpet
laid out for me.

52:54.384 --> 52:56.818
So you're gonna act
salty all night?

52:57.988 --> 53:00.718
Yo, dog,
about to order some wings.

53:00.757 --> 53:02.418
No, thanks, man.

53:04.761 --> 53:06.228
No, we're fine.

53:06.263 --> 53:09.391
Don't worry about
proving everybody wrong.

53:09.433 --> 53:11.401
If you can't handle
the pressure...

53:11.435 --> 53:14.233
I'll understand.

53:14.271 --> 53:15.829
That is so weak.

53:15.873 --> 53:17.238
No. I'm serious.

53:17.274 --> 53:21.005
Who cares if you're never
the first girl to be in the NBA?

53:21.044 --> 53:24.445
You're gonna get more play
being Quincy McCall's girl.

53:29.520 --> 53:31.852
That's what you get.

53:31.889 --> 53:33.982
I got you.

53:34.024 --> 53:36.891
So, how about
a little one on one?

53:36.927 --> 53:39.157
What we playing for?

53:40.964 --> 53:44.456
- Clothes.
- What?

53:48.639 --> 53:51.107
I score, you strip.

53:51.141 --> 53:53.371
You score, I drop something.

53:55.746 --> 53:57.338
Give me the ball.

53:58.482 --> 54:00.746
Home court advantage, baby.

54:00.784 --> 54:03.275
All right. Hold up a second.

54:03.320 --> 54:05.379
Let's see what you got.

54:05.422 --> 54:06.889
Don't reach.

54:06.924 --> 54:08.050
I ain't reaching.

54:10.661 --> 54:12.561
Strip.

54:12.596 --> 54:14.996
All right, George Jefferson.

54:15.032 --> 54:16.966
Take it off, yeah.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.228
It's all right.

54:18.268 --> 54:20.361
First try, lucky try.

54:20.404 --> 54:21.735
What?

54:22.806 --> 54:24.569
Feel the butt.

54:26.543 --> 54:27.532
Where's the "D"?

54:27.578 --> 54:31.537
Kiss my black ass.

54:31.582 --> 54:33.641
I plan to.

54:50.934 --> 54:52.561
Hold up.

54:52.603 --> 54:56.130
All's fair in love
and basketball, baby.

54:56.173 --> 54:57.504
All right.

54:57.541 --> 54:58.940
Strip.

55:03.180 --> 55:05.080
Come on.

55:06.450 --> 55:08.077
You trying to clown?

55:10.754 --> 55:14.588
Too bad you got
your mama's height.

55:14.625 --> 55:16.024
Take it off.

55:20.297 --> 55:22.390
- Come on. Do it.
- You can't hold me.

55:22.432 --> 55:24.400
You're going down.

55:24.434 --> 55:26.561
What? What?

55:26.603 --> 55:28.093
My bad.

55:32.809 --> 55:35.437
Where's the "D"?

55:35.479 --> 55:37.447
It's right here.

55:51.495 --> 55:53.360
I won.

55:53.397 --> 55:55.797
I wanted you to.

55:57.467 --> 56:00.527
It's about emotion.
It's about determination.

56:00.570 --> 56:01.867
It's about heart.

56:01.905 --> 56:03.634
It's college basketball.

56:03.674 --> 56:05.266
And I'm like a kid
in a candy store.

56:05.308 --> 56:07.401
Are you kidding me?
I get so excited about it.

56:07.444 --> 56:09.742
There are too many
great teams to choose from.

56:09.780 --> 56:11.042
I mean,
we're talking about...

56:11.081 --> 56:13.049
the Dukes, the Kentuckys,
Arkansases.

56:13.083 --> 56:14.948
But my surprise treat
this season...

56:14.985 --> 56:19.479
Is the probable emergence of USC
as a basketball powerhouse.

56:19.523 --> 56:20.820
On the men's side...

56:20.857 --> 56:23.826
the heavily recruited
freshman phenom Quincy McCall.

56:23.860 --> 56:27.387
One of my real diaper dandies,
a genuine PTPer...

56:27.431 --> 56:29.490
a prime time player, baby.

56:29.533 --> 56:31.228
And for the women...

56:31.268 --> 56:33.259
while not boasting one of
the top recruiting classes...

56:33.303 --> 56:36.238
they are returning four starters
from last year's squad...

56:36.273 --> 56:38.241
which made it to the sweet 16.

56:38.275 --> 56:40.266
And Coach Ellie Davis
feels that if just...

56:40.310 --> 56:42.505
one of her freshman
has a breakout season...

56:42.546 --> 56:45.709
It's gonna be awesome, baby,
with a capital "A"!

56:48.885 --> 56:50.512
And at guard...

56:50.554 --> 56:56.049
player number 22...
Quincy McCall!

57:51.848 --> 57:53.213
Here, now! A break!

57:53.250 --> 57:55.616
Go, go, go, go!

58:41.097 --> 58:43.065
What else do I have to do?

58:43.099 --> 58:46.728
I mean, up and under between
2 defenders with the left?

58:46.770 --> 58:48.795
That's got to make
"Sports Center."

58:48.839 --> 58:50.397
Zeke and Q.

58:50.440 --> 58:51.737
How you doing, Terry?

58:51.775 --> 58:53.106
What can I get you?

58:53.143 --> 58:54.576
Genuine draft for me.

58:54.611 --> 58:55.976
Orange juice for my son.

58:57.514 --> 59:00.108
Hey, Pop. The numbers
I'm putting up this year...

59:00.150 --> 59:03.017
are better
than any other freshman.

59:03.053 --> 59:07.046
People saying
I'm a definite lottery pick.

59:09.559 --> 59:11.527
What people?

59:11.561 --> 59:13.893
Just people, you know.

59:15.732 --> 59:17.859
Tell them to mind
their own damn business.

59:17.901 --> 59:19.027
Here you go, fellas.

59:19.069 --> 59:20.400
Thanks, Terry.

59:22.906 --> 59:25.739
Quincy,
give yourself time to develop.

59:25.775 --> 59:27.743
Get an education.

59:27.777 --> 59:29.745
The NBA ain't going nowhere.

59:29.779 --> 59:31.747
You're right.

59:37.921 --> 59:40.549
Besides,
the sooner you go pro...

59:40.590 --> 59:43.218
the sooner you got to deal with
the mess I'm dealing with.

59:43.260 --> 59:44.557
What mess?

59:44.594 --> 59:47.722
There's this thing out there,
this paternity suit.

59:47.764 --> 59:49.891
What?

59:49.933 --> 59:52.561
Some girl that's been
hanging on at every party.

59:52.602 --> 59:55.400
Now I'm supposed to be
her baby's daddy.

59:55.438 --> 59:58.168
I told your mom I wanted
to be the one to tell you.

59:58.208 --> 59:59.732
Tell me what?

59:59.776 --> 01:00:02.210
I just told you.

01:00:04.714 --> 01:00:08.172
I mean, it's...
it's not true, is it?

01:00:09.619 --> 01:00:12.383
You got the balls
to ask me that?

01:00:12.422 --> 01:00:15.050
I'm sorry, Pop.

01:00:17.394 --> 01:00:20.124
No. If you need
to hear me say it...

01:00:20.163 --> 01:00:22.825
I'll say it.
It's not true.

01:00:26.436 --> 01:00:29.064
Yo, Q-man.
Awesome game.

01:00:29.105 --> 01:00:30.231
Thanks, man.

01:00:30.273 --> 01:00:32.434
- Can I get your autograph?
- Sure.

01:00:32.475 --> 01:00:34.170
To Paul.

01:00:36.179 --> 01:00:37.305
Thank you.

01:00:37.347 --> 01:00:38.541
Take it easy.

01:00:40.183 --> 01:00:41.650
Let's go, let's go.

01:00:41.685 --> 01:00:43.448
Let's go, USC.

01:00:46.489 --> 01:00:47.649
Time!

01:00:49.826 --> 01:00:50.952
You all right, Sid?

01:00:50.994 --> 01:00:52.393
It's gonna be all right.

01:00:52.429 --> 01:00:54.727
Just hang on. Stay calm.
It's all right.

01:01:02.973 --> 01:01:04.497
Mom?

01:01:11.581 --> 01:01:13.173
I'm late.

01:01:24.594 --> 01:01:25.925
What's up, Ma?

01:01:29.733 --> 01:01:31.792
Hey, you scared me, baby.

01:01:31.835 --> 01:01:33.325
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:01:35.271 --> 01:01:36.397
You OK?

01:01:36.439 --> 01:01:39.533
Mm-hmm. I'm fine.

01:01:39.576 --> 01:01:43.637
You know, Ma, last time
my mother be drinking...

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:45.671
Marvin Gaye died.

01:01:50.453 --> 01:01:52.819
Is it about dad?

01:01:52.856 --> 01:01:55.984
I guess he talked to you.

01:01:59.229 --> 01:02:00.719
Don't sweat it.

01:02:00.764 --> 01:02:05.167
The truth's bound to come out
sooner or later, right?

01:02:05.201 --> 01:02:08.261
And whose truth are
you talking about?

01:02:08.304 --> 01:02:11.467
We can't let something like this
break up the family.

01:02:13.209 --> 01:02:15.336
You do believe him, right?

01:02:16.379 --> 01:02:18.404
Don't you?

01:02:18.448 --> 01:02:20.382
Quincy, just let it go.

01:02:20.417 --> 01:02:22.248
Ma, this ain't
nothing but about money.

01:02:22.285 --> 01:02:24.014
Quincy, please.

01:02:24.054 --> 01:02:27.683
How many times you told me
to watch these hos out there?

01:02:28.858 --> 01:02:31.691
I should have been telling
your father that.

01:02:31.728 --> 01:02:36.927
So you're gonna take
the word of some trick over Pop?

01:02:48.411 --> 01:02:49.571
What's this?

01:02:49.612 --> 01:02:51.375
I hired somebody.

01:02:51.414 --> 01:02:54.178
Ain't that pathetic?

01:02:54.217 --> 01:02:58.119
After all his late nights
and his meetings...

01:02:58.154 --> 01:03:00.748
and I still needed proof.

01:03:02.492 --> 01:03:08.556
I used to think that I was lucky
being married to Zeke McCall.

01:03:10.567 --> 01:03:13.536
I am too tired.

01:03:13.570 --> 01:03:17.301
I am tired.

01:03:32.455 --> 01:03:34.446
Mama, don't cry.

01:03:57.147 --> 01:03:58.910
Put your hands in your pockets.

01:03:58.948 --> 01:04:00.643
Keep your head up.

01:04:00.683 --> 01:04:04.119
Always look a man in the eye.

01:04:04.154 --> 01:04:06.122
All the time,
I'm hanging on his every word...

01:04:06.156 --> 01:04:08.249
like he's God or something.

01:04:08.291 --> 01:04:11.385
Q, I know he messed up...

01:04:11.427 --> 01:04:14.419
but that doesn't change
what he's been to you.

01:04:18.368 --> 01:04:19.835
What has he been to me?

01:04:22.372 --> 01:04:24.237
The man looked me in my eye...

01:04:24.274 --> 01:04:27.539
and he lied to me
like it was nothing.

01:04:27.577 --> 01:04:28.737
Like...

01:04:31.047 --> 01:04:32.912
Like it was easy.

01:04:36.252 --> 01:04:40.211
I know some guys dog
their wives, you know, but...

01:04:40.256 --> 01:04:41.746
man, I didn't...

01:04:41.791 --> 01:04:44.919
I never thought my pop
would do something like that.

01:04:58.074 --> 01:04:59.371
What?

01:04:59.409 --> 01:05:01.070
Nothing.

01:05:03.146 --> 01:05:05.341
Why don't we walk to my dorm?

01:05:06.749 --> 01:05:10.310
I don't feel like
running into anybody.

01:05:10.353 --> 01:05:13.083
Let's just kick it here.

01:05:18.294 --> 01:05:19.886
I can't.

01:05:19.929 --> 01:05:21.328
Why not?

01:05:24.234 --> 01:05:27.226
Coach has us on 11:00 curfew.

01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:31.263
If I'm late, I don't suit up.

01:05:38.715 --> 01:05:40.842
I could stay a few more minutes.

01:05:40.883 --> 01:05:42.145
Don't sweat it.

01:05:43.853 --> 01:05:45.286
Quincy, I'm sorry.

01:05:45.321 --> 01:05:50.190
All right, for real,
I should be alone right now, OK?

01:05:58.468 --> 01:06:00.493
Give me a call, maybe,
when you get in?

01:06:00.536 --> 01:06:02.595
I'll stay up.

01:07:27.156 --> 01:07:28.350
Gimme the ball!

01:07:42.638 --> 01:07:43.798
Hustle up!

01:08:06.963 --> 01:08:08.555
Let's play.

01:08:09.966 --> 01:08:11.297
Play smart.

01:08:14.237 --> 01:08:15.397
Hold it!

01:08:22.444 --> 01:08:24.379
Get back, get back!

01:08:43.299 --> 01:08:46.096
No shot!
Offensive foul!

01:08:53.443 --> 01:08:55.171
Good job!

01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:07.087
Yeah, baby! We won!

01:09:29.178 --> 01:09:34.741
You see that crowd?

01:09:34.783 --> 01:09:36.444
Oh, damn, mon,
I think old girl...

01:09:36.486 --> 01:09:43.392
took out your chi-chis
with that shot.

01:09:43.426 --> 01:09:45.986
Yo, T, why you so quiet?

01:09:46.028 --> 01:09:47.518
Just thinking about next year.

01:09:47.563 --> 01:09:50.395
I thought you were hyped
about playing overseas.

01:09:50.433 --> 01:09:53.060
I was, but it's never
gonna be like this...

01:09:53.102 --> 01:09:56.868
playing in front of my family,
hanging out with my homegirls.

01:09:56.906 --> 01:09:58.874
Probably don't even have
a McDonald's over there.

01:09:58.908 --> 01:10:01.308
Girl, please,
there's always a McDonald's.

01:10:09.185 --> 01:10:10.345
Is she pregnant?

01:10:11.521 --> 01:10:13.386
Better be Q.

01:10:31.574 --> 01:10:35.135
You could have given up
after you threw that ball away.

01:10:35.177 --> 01:10:38.806
But you kept your head,
and you showed real heart.

01:10:38.848 --> 01:10:40.543
Thanks, Coach.

01:10:40.583 --> 01:10:43.074
Our final games are against
Oregon and Oregon State...

01:10:43.119 --> 01:10:45.610
and I want to shake
things up a bit, so...

01:10:45.655 --> 01:10:48.852
I'm starting you at point again.

01:10:48.891 --> 01:10:51.121
But l...

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:54.425
I thought Sidra's ankle
was OKfor next game.

01:10:54.463 --> 01:10:56.226
You want the job or not?

01:11:02.705 --> 01:11:04.070
What?

01:11:04.106 --> 01:11:05.869
It just...

01:11:05.908 --> 01:11:09.275
It just seems like
you're always riding me.

01:11:11.113 --> 01:11:14.105
You think I'd go hoarse
for a player with no potential?

01:11:16.352 --> 01:11:19.378
When I ignore you,
then you worry.

01:11:37.306 --> 01:11:38.637
Q in the house!

01:11:55.091 --> 01:11:57.184
I missed you all day.

01:11:57.226 --> 01:11:58.853
Really?

01:12:00.763 --> 01:12:02.458
I came by your crib.

01:12:02.498 --> 01:12:04.625
Darren said you'd be here.

01:12:04.667 --> 01:12:06.134
When was this?

01:12:06.168 --> 01:12:09.001
A little after my game.

01:12:11.707 --> 01:12:15.268
Look, we went
to celebrate after, all right?

01:12:15.311 --> 01:12:17.905
But I came right after that.

01:12:21.117 --> 01:12:22.414
Sorry about your game.

01:12:22.451 --> 01:12:25.147
Hey, it happens, right?

01:12:25.187 --> 01:12:27.121
What's up, superstar?

01:12:27.156 --> 01:12:28.680
Did you hear about your girl?

01:12:28.724 --> 01:12:30.351
She won the starting spot.

01:12:30.393 --> 01:12:32.623
Oh. Hey, where the keg at?

01:12:32.662 --> 01:12:34.152
It's in the back room.

01:12:51.947 --> 01:12:53.073
What's up?

01:12:53.115 --> 01:12:55.083
Just wanted to say good game.

01:12:55.117 --> 01:12:56.243
But?

01:12:56.285 --> 01:13:00.221
No buts.

01:13:00.256 --> 01:13:02.121
Thanks.

01:13:02.158 --> 01:13:04.319
Just one word of advice
for next season.

01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:06.590
What's that?

01:13:06.629 --> 01:13:10.759
Never let a freshman
take your spot.

01:13:36.926 --> 01:13:40.487
All right, Q-man.
I'll see you.

01:13:45.935 --> 01:13:48.426
Who was that?

01:13:48.471 --> 01:13:50.063
Nobody.

01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:52.901
Who's nobody?

01:13:52.942 --> 01:13:54.307
Look, this party's wack.

01:13:54.343 --> 01:13:56.208
You ready to go?

01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:59.209
Do you want to go talk?

01:13:59.248 --> 01:14:00.545
Not really.

01:14:02.818 --> 01:14:06.618
We can finish what we were
talking about last night.

01:14:15.831 --> 01:14:18.527
Q, quit!

01:14:18.567 --> 01:14:20.125
What's wrong?

01:14:22.438 --> 01:14:25.430
You know what?
I'm gonna go crash.

01:14:26.776 --> 01:14:28.175
Fine.

01:14:31.714 --> 01:14:34.046
Maybe I'll come by later.

01:14:34.083 --> 01:14:36.745
Nah, I got curfew.

01:14:52.601 --> 01:14:55.729
What are you doing here?

01:14:55.771 --> 01:14:57.568
The door was unlocked.

01:14:57.606 --> 01:14:59.938
It still is.
You can let yourself out.

01:14:59.975 --> 01:15:03.035
I messed up, OK?
I know that.

01:15:03.078 --> 01:15:04.773
But I ain't that kid's father.

01:15:04.814 --> 01:15:06.338
Lucky kid.

01:15:06.382 --> 01:15:11.376
I ain't saying it's right,
just sometimes, things happen.

01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:12.819
Some things should
never fucking happen!

01:15:12.855 --> 01:15:17.053
Look, boy, you so perfect
you can look down on me?

01:15:17.092 --> 01:15:19.492
I'm not a liar.

01:15:19.528 --> 01:15:23.157
Your mama's real quick
to show you those pictures, huh?

01:15:23.199 --> 01:15:25.167
She was 19
when she got pregnant.

01:15:25.201 --> 01:15:28.534
Don't get me wrong, you're
the best thing in my life.

01:15:28.571 --> 01:15:31.267
But she knew I wasn't ready
for no marriage.

01:15:31.307 --> 01:15:32.797
You're trying to say
my mother trapped you?

01:15:32.842 --> 01:15:35.811
I'm saying I handled
my responsibilities like a man.

01:15:35.845 --> 01:15:39.804
Now when you're in the NBA,
and you roll into a city...

01:15:39.849 --> 01:15:42.409
there's a hundred girls
waiting down in that lobby.

01:15:42.451 --> 01:15:43.850
Listen to me.

01:15:43.886 --> 01:15:46.684
There's twenty more that make it
past security onto your floor...

01:15:46.722 --> 01:15:51.921
and the boldest one
is there at your front door.

01:15:51.961 --> 01:15:55.522
After a while, it just becomes
part of the game.

01:15:55.564 --> 01:15:58.590
I'm sorry I lied to you
when I shouldn't have...

01:15:58.634 --> 01:16:01.068
but I only did it
because I didn't want to see...

01:16:01.103 --> 01:16:03.435
that look on your face
that you got right now.

01:16:05.341 --> 01:16:07.809
Well,
since we're being so honest...

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:13.841
Since we're being so honest...

01:16:13.883 --> 01:16:15.544
I figured that I'd tell you...

01:16:15.584 --> 01:16:18.678
I decided to drop out of school
and turn pro.

01:16:18.721 --> 01:16:21.053
Oh, boy. Damn it!

01:16:24.026 --> 01:16:27.757
Look, man,
I know you're mad at me, OK?

01:16:27.796 --> 01:16:30.060
But I cannot let you do this.

01:16:30.099 --> 01:16:34.160
I always thought "can't"
wasn't in a man's vocabulary.

01:17:20.049 --> 01:17:21.710
Hey, what's up?

01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:23.081
Downtown.

01:17:23.118 --> 01:17:24.244
Hey, what's up, girl?

01:17:24.286 --> 01:17:25.412
Where's your boy?

01:17:25.454 --> 01:17:27.046
Oh, in back.

01:17:27.089 --> 01:17:29.387
- Oh, man!
- Here you go.

01:17:34.196 --> 01:17:35.356
Hey, baby.

01:17:40.903 --> 01:17:42.598
You weren't at my game.

01:17:42.638 --> 01:17:44.162
I'm sorry.

01:17:44.206 --> 01:17:47.141
I had this meeting
with this guy.

01:17:47.176 --> 01:17:49.167
You win?

01:17:49.211 --> 01:17:52.180
Yeah, I hit four 3s.

01:17:53.182 --> 01:17:56.743
The man again, huh?

01:17:56.785 --> 01:17:58.912
No, the woman.

01:18:02.958 --> 01:18:04.255
What's up?

01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:13.491
Monica, this is Kerry.

01:18:13.535 --> 01:18:15.628
Kerry, this is Monica.

01:18:18.841 --> 01:18:20.331
What's going on?

01:18:20.376 --> 01:18:23.106
I was about
to go get some food.

01:18:23.145 --> 01:18:24.874
You want to come?

01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:33.311
Maybe I should come back.

01:18:33.355 --> 01:18:35.880
No, you stay.

01:18:35.924 --> 01:18:37.516
I'll leave.

01:18:43.032 --> 01:18:44.590
Ready?

01:19:00.849 --> 01:19:02.646
What are you doing here?

01:19:02.684 --> 01:19:05.847
I didn't know I needed
a reason to come home.

01:19:05.888 --> 01:19:08.618
Don't be so defensive.
I'm surprised to see you.

01:19:08.657 --> 01:19:09.817
Dad around?

01:19:09.858 --> 01:19:12.588
No. He's still at the bank.

01:19:12.628 --> 01:19:14.960
Is everything OK?

01:19:17.032 --> 01:19:20.832
Good. I'm going to the market
to get things for dinner.

01:19:20.869 --> 01:19:22.734
Will you join us?

01:19:22.771 --> 01:19:24.261
I don't know.

01:19:24.306 --> 01:19:26.740
It's just a game.

01:19:26.775 --> 01:19:29.335
What?

01:19:29.378 --> 01:19:31.437
Every time you lose,
you get this attitude...

01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:33.948
but it is just a game.

01:19:33.982 --> 01:19:36.542
Got your key?

01:19:53.469 --> 01:19:55.266
Can we talk?

01:19:55.304 --> 01:19:56.931
Talk to your new girlfriend.

01:19:56.972 --> 01:19:58.837
I took the ho to Burger King.

01:19:58.874 --> 01:20:01.775
- Cheap date.
- She had time for me.

01:20:01.810 --> 01:20:04.438
You messed around
to prove a point?

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:07.244
You got your head
so far up your ass...

01:20:07.282 --> 01:20:08.874
it took a cheap date
for you to notice me.

01:20:08.917 --> 01:20:11.818
Did I forget to kiss your ass
like everybody else?

01:20:11.854 --> 01:20:14.220
You forgot to be there.

01:20:14.256 --> 01:20:16.656
You wanted to talk about
your dad, I had curfew.

01:20:16.692 --> 01:20:19.855
- What was I supposed to do?
- Stay!

01:20:19.895 --> 01:20:22.227
If I stayed,
I wouldn't be starting.

01:20:22.264 --> 01:20:24.630
At least you got
your priorities straight.

01:20:24.666 --> 01:20:26.463
I'd never ask you to choose.

01:20:26.502 --> 01:20:28.470
You'd never have to.

01:20:28.504 --> 01:20:30.404
I'm a ballplayer.

01:20:30.439 --> 01:20:33.203
If anybody knows what that means
it should be you.

01:20:33.242 --> 01:20:36.734
If basketball is all
you care about, why bone me?

01:20:36.778 --> 01:20:39.178
Why don't you bone Dick Vitale?

01:20:40.449 --> 01:20:42.110
Wait a minute. Hold on.

01:20:53.128 --> 01:20:58.395
How do I know the next time
you're feeling neglected...

01:20:58.433 --> 01:21:00.993
you're not gonna
just run around on me?

01:21:01.036 --> 01:21:03.800
If we're going to be together...

01:21:03.839 --> 01:21:06.364
I have to be able
to trust you.

01:21:09.711 --> 01:21:12.373
I'm not asking for us
to be together.

01:21:14.516 --> 01:21:15.676
What?

01:21:15.717 --> 01:21:18.083
I'm going through
a lot of shit right now.

01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:20.281
It's obviously more
then you got time for.

01:21:20.322 --> 01:21:24.850
How can you tell me
what I have time for?

01:21:28.597 --> 01:21:31.691
Whatever I did,
we can fix this.

01:21:31.733 --> 01:21:34.361
I don't think so.

01:21:34.403 --> 01:21:37.201
You don't think so?

01:21:37.239 --> 01:21:39.139
I'm entering the draft.

01:21:39.174 --> 01:21:40.300
You're what?

01:21:40.342 --> 01:21:41.866
I'm going pro.

01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:44.572
Who knows where
I'm gonna end up, you know?

01:21:44.613 --> 01:21:47.673
When did you decide all this?

01:21:47.716 --> 01:21:49.183
A few days ago.

01:21:57.226 --> 01:21:59.717
So that's it?

01:21:59.761 --> 01:22:01.558
Just...

01:22:04.066 --> 01:22:06.261
Just forget about you and me?

01:22:08.103 --> 01:22:10.697
I'd still like to be friends.

01:22:10.739 --> 01:22:12.639
Friends.

01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:21.044
I'll see you around.

01:24:48.029 --> 01:24:49.496
Luisa, what did he say?

01:24:49.531 --> 01:24:51.590
He say to give the ball to you.

01:25:06.748 --> 01:25:08.909
What's up?

01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:11.919
What's up, Sidra?

01:25:11.953 --> 01:25:13.545
What do you know?

01:25:13.588 --> 01:25:17.354
I'll love winning
this championship in your house.

01:25:17.392 --> 01:25:20.327
How do you say,
"You're dreaming," in Italian?

01:25:20.362 --> 01:25:23.126
This ain't college,
and I ain't on crutches.

01:26:10.412 --> 01:26:13.279
Can you take that damn thing
off the table?

01:26:13.315 --> 01:26:16.182
You mean
my championship trophy?

01:26:16.218 --> 01:26:18.277
My bad.

01:26:20.388 --> 01:26:22.379
You are still a cocky bitch.

01:26:32.567 --> 01:26:33.898
Look at you.

01:26:33.935 --> 01:26:37.234
So what are
these Spanish guys like?

01:26:37.272 --> 01:26:39.263
I wouldn't know.

01:26:39.307 --> 01:26:41.207
What?

01:26:41.243 --> 01:26:44.269
You've been here seven months
and ain't tapped nothing?

01:26:46.314 --> 01:26:48.373
Just not my type, I guess.

01:26:48.416 --> 01:26:50.907
Shit. Them Italian boys?

01:26:50.952 --> 01:26:53.079
They love them
some black women.

01:26:53.121 --> 01:26:54.281
They can't get enough of me.

01:27:02.130 --> 01:27:03.927
Do you ever
think about going back?

01:27:03.965 --> 01:27:07.401
Sometimes,
but what's the alternative?

01:27:07.435 --> 01:27:09.096
Not playing?

01:27:09.137 --> 01:27:11.298
Do you remember Big Toni?

01:27:11.339 --> 01:27:14.740
She quit last year
and works at some bookstore.

01:27:14.776 --> 01:27:16.403
Look at us.

01:27:16.444 --> 01:27:20.278
They treat us like
Hollywood stars over here.

01:27:20.315 --> 01:27:23.876
We just played in
the championship game.

01:27:23.919 --> 01:27:26.285
It doesn't get
much sweeter than this.

01:28:02.824 --> 01:28:06.385
7 straight points in this run.
Worthy for 3.

01:28:09.564 --> 01:28:12.226
Stu, this game
is in the refrigerator.

01:28:12.267 --> 01:28:13.529
The door is closed.
The lights are out.

01:28:13.568 --> 01:28:14.865
The eggs are cooling.
Butter gettin' hard,

01:28:14.903 --> 01:28:16.803
and the Jell-O's jigglin'.

01:28:16.838 --> 01:28:18.465
And here come the subs.

01:28:18.506 --> 01:28:20.770
It's nice to see the subs
get a chance to play.

01:28:20.809 --> 01:28:23.744
- The fans love it.
- They really do.

01:28:23.778 --> 01:28:26.838
Quincy McCall
is in for Nick Van Exel.

01:28:30.251 --> 01:28:31.843
Quincy has got
the ball over in the corner.

01:28:31.886 --> 01:28:33.945
Puts up a 3-pointer.
That's no good.

01:28:33.989 --> 01:28:36.958
The former Trojan came out
after his freshman year...

01:28:36.992 --> 01:28:38.653
and as they go down
the floor the other way...

01:28:38.693 --> 01:28:41.491
I can tell you he has
moved around quite a bit...

01:28:41.529 --> 01:28:44.862
but now he's trying to find
a home with these Lakers.

01:28:44.899 --> 01:28:46.560
Quincy makes a steal.
He's on his way.

01:28:46.601 --> 01:28:48.364
Open court. Look out, folks.

01:28:48.403 --> 01:28:49.700
It's showtime!

01:29:21.636 --> 01:29:24.230
- How is he?
- Not great.

01:29:24.272 --> 01:29:26.331
What is "Not great"?

01:29:28.510 --> 01:29:30.444
He tore his a.c.I.

01:29:35.583 --> 01:29:39.212
Almost didn't recognize you
with your hair like that.

01:29:39.254 --> 01:29:40.846
How you been?

01:29:40.889 --> 01:29:43.255
Happy...

01:29:43.291 --> 01:29:45.657
and he won't want
to see you.

01:30:05.847 --> 01:30:07.007
Hey, son.

01:30:10.218 --> 01:30:12.152
You made "Sports Center."

01:30:12.187 --> 01:30:14.348
What do you want?

01:30:14.389 --> 01:30:16.687
Just came by to check on you.

01:30:16.725 --> 01:30:19.819
After five years?

01:30:19.861 --> 01:30:22.455
Don't remember
that being all my fault.

01:30:22.497 --> 01:30:25.398
Seems like you divorced me
same time as your mom.

01:30:27.502 --> 01:30:29.299
Look...

01:30:30.472 --> 01:30:33.964
I know things look
kind of bleak right now...

01:30:34.008 --> 01:30:36.499
but don't get down
on yourself.

01:30:36.544 --> 01:30:40.844
I stopped taking your advice
a long time ago...

01:30:40.882 --> 01:30:42.349
or did you forget?

01:30:42.383 --> 01:30:44.817
You want me to step off?

01:30:46.154 --> 01:30:49.954
Fine, but not until
I say something.

01:30:49.991 --> 01:30:53.017
You're a better ballplayer
than I ever was.

01:30:55.029 --> 01:30:57.725
But that ain't the only thing
you got going for you.

01:30:57.766 --> 01:31:01.327
You're smart, Quincy.

01:31:01.369 --> 01:31:07.308
I always knew you could do
anything you wanted to.

01:31:07.342 --> 01:31:11.278
You want to play ball, son?
Then play ball.

01:31:11.312 --> 01:31:15.009
Just know you're not like
everybody else on that court.

01:31:17.252 --> 01:31:20.244
You're not like I was.

01:31:20.288 --> 01:31:21.778
You got options.

01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:28.420
That's all
I ever wanted to show you.

01:31:29.998 --> 01:31:33.695
How come you couldn't be the man
you tried to make me?

01:31:37.071 --> 01:31:38.800
I just couldn't, son.

01:32:01.729 --> 01:32:03.162
Good morning!

01:32:34.395 --> 01:32:37.262
And I thought
this was gonna be awkward.

01:32:44.105 --> 01:32:45.538
I got these.

01:32:47.876 --> 01:32:50.037
Not that you need any more.

01:32:53.214 --> 01:32:54.681
So how're you doing?

01:32:54.716 --> 01:32:58.379
I'm doing all right.

01:32:58.419 --> 01:33:00.853
I heard you were in Spain.

01:33:00.889 --> 01:33:03.722
I was.

01:33:03.758 --> 01:33:05.817
I see your peach fuzz
finally grew in.

01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:08.260
Just something new
I'm trying.

01:33:08.296 --> 01:33:12.756
No, it looks good.
It's cool.

01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:14.768
Thank you.

01:33:14.802 --> 01:33:17.236
Shouldn't you be lying down?

01:33:17.272 --> 01:33:19.968
No, I'm cool. Have a seat.

01:33:20.008 --> 01:33:23.136
No, I'm fine.

01:33:28.249 --> 01:33:31.810
Still trying to be
the first girl in the NBA?

01:33:31.853 --> 01:33:34.822
I tried sneaking in
after college...

01:33:34.856 --> 01:33:38.223
but they found breasts
during my physical.

01:33:38.259 --> 01:33:40.227
That's funny. I never did.

01:33:40.261 --> 01:33:43.321
Kiss my ass.

01:33:47.368 --> 01:33:49.928
I can't believe
it's been five years.

01:33:49.971 --> 01:33:52.701
I tried calling you
a couple of times.

01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:54.071
Oh, yeah?

01:33:54.108 --> 01:33:57.908
I wanted to give you props on
making first team All-American.

01:33:57.946 --> 01:34:01.677
Then, when Magic retired,
I tried again.

01:34:01.716 --> 01:34:04.981
Must have been my cheap-ass
answering machine.

01:34:05.019 --> 01:34:07.510
It was always messing up.

01:34:07.555 --> 01:34:09.819
I figured something like that.

01:34:12.827 --> 01:34:15.660
So when you going back?

01:34:15.697 --> 01:34:21.101
Actually... l'm not.

01:34:21.135 --> 01:34:23.831
What do you mean?

01:34:23.871 --> 01:34:26.465
I'm tired of playing overseas.

01:34:26.507 --> 01:34:31.444
I'm over there by myself,
no family, no friends.

01:34:31.479 --> 01:34:33.709
My phone bill is ridiculous.

01:34:36.484 --> 01:34:39.009
Thinking about giving it
a rest for a while.

01:34:39.053 --> 01:34:42.921
A rest?

01:34:42.957 --> 01:34:47.121
Basketball just isn't fun
for me anymore.

01:34:47.161 --> 01:34:48.287
You know?

01:34:58.206 --> 01:34:59.468
Hey, babe.

01:34:59.507 --> 01:35:00.439
Baby.

01:35:03.311 --> 01:35:06.940
Nobody would
switch flights with me.

01:35:06.981 --> 01:35:09.142
Baby, what are you
doing out of bed?

01:35:09.183 --> 01:35:10.172
What are you doing?

01:35:29.470 --> 01:35:32.439
Baby, this is Monica.

01:35:32.473 --> 01:35:34.566
You guys grew up together,
right?

01:35:34.609 --> 01:35:37.806
Quincy's
told me all about you.

01:35:37.845 --> 01:35:41.110
Monica, this is Kyra,
my fiancee,

01:35:43.317 --> 01:35:45.785
Fiancee?

01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:48.880
Wow.

01:35:51.325 --> 01:35:53.259
Congratulations.

01:35:53.294 --> 01:35:54.955
Thank you.

01:35:54.996 --> 01:35:59.763
I didn't know.

01:35:59.801 --> 01:36:02.133
That's great.

01:36:06.741 --> 01:36:09.767
Well, I should go.

01:36:14.715 --> 01:36:17.183
Monica, I really appreciate
you coming by.

01:36:17.218 --> 01:36:22.053
We really appreciate it.

01:36:22.090 --> 01:36:26.322
Quincy, good luck
with your knee and everything.

01:36:42.844 --> 01:36:45.677
Your sister's bringing
the baby by later, so...

01:36:45.713 --> 01:36:47.510
be nice to be around.

01:36:47.548 --> 01:36:50.073
I can't wait to see her.

01:36:53.054 --> 01:36:54.180
Need any help?

01:36:54.222 --> 01:36:57.350
No, I can manage, thank you.

01:37:01.896 --> 01:37:03.921
I just saw Quincy.

01:37:03.965 --> 01:37:07.457
How's he?

01:37:07.502 --> 01:37:09.402
Engaged.

01:37:09.437 --> 01:37:11.166
To that stewardess?

01:37:11.205 --> 01:37:13.935
You met her?

01:37:13.975 --> 01:37:17.604
His mother had a barbecue
a few weeks back.

01:37:19.413 --> 01:37:21.540
He could do a lot better,
if you ask me.

01:37:27.922 --> 01:37:29.480
So what do I do?

01:37:29.524 --> 01:37:32.254
Find out where they're
registered and send a gift.

01:37:32.293 --> 01:37:34.158
Whatever.

01:37:34.195 --> 01:37:37.460
Is that still your answer
to everything?

01:37:37.498 --> 01:37:40.092
When you come at me
with bullshit like that.

01:37:40.134 --> 01:37:42.898
Are they cursing
their mamas in Spain?

01:37:42.937 --> 01:37:46.634
You didn't want my opinion,
why did you ask?

01:37:46.674 --> 01:37:49.973
I asked, but why does it
have to be so damn prissy?

01:37:50.011 --> 01:37:51.478
What do you want me
to say, Monica?

01:37:51.512 --> 01:37:54.072
Go over there
and beat up the girl?

01:37:54.115 --> 01:37:56.640
Go have sex with him?

01:37:56.684 --> 01:37:58.345
'Cause I'm not gonna do it.

01:37:58.386 --> 01:38:00.877
Yes, I think decorum
is important...

01:38:00.922 --> 01:38:05.325
and yes, I'd rather bake a pie
than shoot a jump-up shot.

01:38:05.359 --> 01:38:09.989
If that makes me too prissy
for you, too damn bad.

01:38:10.031 --> 01:38:12.192
So that's why
we can't get along?

01:38:12.233 --> 01:38:15.225
Because I'd rather shoot
a stupid jump shot?

01:38:15.269 --> 01:38:17.863
You always turn
your nose up at me.

01:38:17.905 --> 01:38:18.872
No, I don't.

01:38:18.906 --> 01:38:22.103
Oh, yes.
Female superstar athlete...

01:38:22.143 --> 01:38:24.737
whose mother is nothing
but a housewife.

01:38:24.779 --> 01:38:25.939
That's not it.

01:38:25.980 --> 01:38:28.847
Don't tell me you're not
ashamed of me. I know.

01:38:31.719 --> 01:38:35.018
I remember when
I was eight years old.

01:38:35.056 --> 01:38:38.992
You spent four hours cooking up
this big, fancy meal...

01:38:39.026 --> 01:38:42.120
and I guess you and dad
got your wires crossed.

01:38:42.163 --> 01:38:45.428
In he walks with
a couple of pizzas...

01:38:45.466 --> 01:38:48.867
and you didn't say anything.

01:38:48.903 --> 01:38:54.273
You never stood up
for yourself. Ever.

01:38:54.308 --> 01:38:56.936
If I was ashamed,
it was because of that.

01:38:56.978 --> 01:38:59.310
That is ridiculous.

01:38:59.347 --> 01:39:02.441
What's ridiculous
is not being a caterer...

01:39:02.483 --> 01:39:04.576
so your husband
can feel like a man...

01:39:04.619 --> 01:39:08.851
knowing his woman's cooking
and ironing his drawers.

01:39:08.889 --> 01:39:10.481
Damn it.

01:39:13.027 --> 01:39:14.961
I'm sorry.

01:39:14.996 --> 01:39:18.625
Is that really
all you think about me?

01:39:23.638 --> 01:39:27.836
When your daddy and I
got married, I had dreams.

01:39:27.875 --> 01:39:31.106
But I happen to have
gotten pregnant with Lena...

01:39:31.145 --> 01:39:32.908
and then I had you...

01:39:32.947 --> 01:39:35.347
so I had to put
my dreams on hold.

01:39:40.421 --> 01:39:43.015
You know what day I remember?

01:39:43.057 --> 01:39:49.018
In high school,
your spring dance...

01:39:49.063 --> 01:39:52.726
and I put my mother's pearls
around your neck...

01:39:52.767 --> 01:39:55.395
and I told you
you were beautiful...

01:39:55.436 --> 01:39:58.371
because you were.

01:39:58.406 --> 01:40:00.237
That day,
I was happy I didn't have...

01:40:00.274 --> 01:40:03.004
a catering business
to run off to.

01:40:07.515 --> 01:40:09.710
My family had
three meals a day.

01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:11.718
They had somebody
to pick up after them...

01:40:11.752 --> 01:40:14.880
and when my daughters
went to a dance...

01:40:14.922 --> 01:40:18.517
I could help them
get ready.

01:40:18.559 --> 01:40:20.925
That is what
I came to care about.

01:40:20.961 --> 01:40:23.259
That's all you cared about.

01:40:25.599 --> 01:40:30.093
I must have played
in a thousand games...

01:40:30.137 --> 01:40:33.436
and I can only remember
you being at two.

01:40:33.474 --> 01:40:36.568
You had your coaches
and your daddy for that stuff.

01:40:36.610 --> 01:40:40.273
It never mattered to you
whether I was at them games.

01:40:40.314 --> 01:40:42.441
It mattered, Mama.

01:40:45.286 --> 01:40:47.618
It mattered.

01:41:48.048 --> 01:41:50.312
Save pulls up
the original account.

01:41:50.351 --> 01:41:53.980
Shift F8
pulls up the open account.

01:41:57.124 --> 01:41:58.250
Oh, hello, Mr. Wright.

01:41:58.292 --> 01:41:59.452
- Could you excuse me?
- Sure.

01:41:59.493 --> 01:42:00.585
Thank you.

01:42:02.329 --> 01:42:03.489
How's it going?

01:42:04.598 --> 01:42:06.190
- Fine.
- Fine?

01:43:40.728 --> 01:43:41.922
Damn, girl.

01:43:43.264 --> 01:43:45.630
I remember your mom
had to beat you into a dress.

01:43:46.700 --> 01:43:47.962
Very funny.

01:43:49.303 --> 01:43:50.463
Visitin'?

01:43:51.372 --> 01:43:53.033
Kyra's out of town
for a couple of days.

01:43:53.073 --> 01:43:55.405
Figured I'd keep my mom company.

01:43:55.442 --> 01:43:56.636
So how's the knee?

01:43:57.811 --> 01:43:58.971
It's getting there.

01:44:00.381 --> 01:44:02.372
Strong enough
to get you down the aisle?

01:44:03.484 --> 01:44:04.678
Two weeks.

01:44:06.787 --> 01:44:09.221
I didn't get to send you
an invitation, but...

01:44:09.256 --> 01:44:11.850
Oh, it's OK. It's OK.
I'm probably...

01:44:12.993 --> 01:44:14.153
you know.

01:44:20.334 --> 01:44:21.494
Can I ask you something?

01:44:24.905 --> 01:44:27.373
You never told me
why ball wasn't fun anymore.

01:44:28.776 --> 01:44:29.936
It just isn't.

01:44:31.011 --> 01:44:33.343
Cause I'm kinda feelin'
that way, too.

01:44:33.380 --> 01:44:35.541
We had a rough couple a years.
That's all.

01:44:36.984 --> 01:44:39.043
I haven't dribbled a ball
in four and a half months.

01:44:40.955 --> 01:44:42.547
I may miss the attention,
but besides that...

01:44:42.590 --> 01:44:43.750
You're serious.

01:44:44.992 --> 01:44:47.552
Seems like I needed ball when
I was trying to be like my pop.

01:44:48.862 --> 01:44:51.353
No. I was tryin' to be better
than my pop.

01:44:53.667 --> 01:44:55.692
Now it's time
I tried something different.

01:44:55.736 --> 01:44:56.930
Like what?

01:44:58.305 --> 01:45:00.034
Well, I'm thinkin' about
goin' back to school.

01:45:01.141 --> 01:45:02.699
What?

01:45:04.878 --> 01:45:06.641
Wow.

01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:08.910
Yeah. Kyra hasn't heard about
the school thing yet.

01:45:10.284 --> 01:45:12.912
She'll probably say
it's the painkillers talkin'.

01:45:14.722 --> 01:45:15.950
It's a trip, you know?

01:45:18.225 --> 01:45:20.056
When you're a kid, you...

01:45:20.094 --> 01:45:21.721
You see the life you want...

01:45:22.663 --> 01:45:24.153
and it never
crosses your mind...

01:45:24.198 --> 01:45:25.825
that it's not gonna turn out
that way.

01:45:25.866 --> 01:45:28.027
So why did you give up ball?

01:45:28.068 --> 01:45:29.330
Why do you keep
sweatin' me on that?

01:45:29.370 --> 01:45:30.837
Because I don't get it.

01:45:30.871 --> 01:45:32.236
Man, I never knew a girl...

01:45:32.272 --> 01:45:35.036
I never knew anyone
who loved ball as much as you.

01:45:36.443 --> 01:45:38.172
Now all of a sudden, you're
gonna trade in your Nikes...

01:45:38.212 --> 01:45:40.339
for a pair of shoes
you can't even walk in.

01:45:42.182 --> 01:45:43.342
What's up?

01:45:45.953 --> 01:45:47.887
Just leave it alone, all right?

01:45:49.923 --> 01:45:51.390
All right.

01:46:08.342 --> 01:46:09.536
You need to put a sweater
on him.

01:46:09.576 --> 01:46:10.975
It's a little chilly, sweetie.

01:46:11.011 --> 01:46:12.444
She's fine, ma.

01:46:12.479 --> 01:46:16.779
Yes. Her little icicle arms
are so sweet.

01:46:18.185 --> 01:46:20.346
All right, ma.

01:46:20.387 --> 01:46:21.649
Come on, Lorraina.

01:46:23.757 --> 01:46:25.850
Your grandma says it's too cold.

01:46:25.893 --> 01:46:28.361
Oh, grandma.

01:46:40.441 --> 01:46:41.908
You know, Monica...

01:46:44.111 --> 01:46:50.243
one of the things that always
drove me crazy about you...

01:46:50.284 --> 01:46:53.617
and I have to admit
it made me jealous...

01:46:53.654 --> 01:46:57.647
I always admired
was the fight in you.

01:46:58.659 --> 01:47:00.456
What are you talking about?

01:47:00.494 --> 01:47:01.654
Well...

01:47:03.130 --> 01:47:07.260
I might be a little more prissy
in this situation that you...

01:47:07.301 --> 01:47:09.826
but remember when I said
Quincy could do better?

01:47:11.505 --> 01:47:13.564
I was talkin' about you.

01:48:15.502 --> 01:48:16.696
What's goin' on?

01:48:16.737 --> 01:48:18.864
We need to talk.

01:48:20.741 --> 01:48:21.901
Please?

01:48:42.930 --> 01:48:45.296
You asked me what was missing.

01:48:46.333 --> 01:48:48.460
- What?
- From basketball.

01:48:48.502 --> 01:48:50.163
You woke me up to tell me that?

01:48:50.204 --> 01:48:53.765
It's not fun for me anymore,
because you're missing.

01:48:54.942 --> 01:48:56.842
What I'm trying to say is...

01:48:59.146 --> 01:49:01.341
I've loved you
since I was eleven.

01:49:02.816 --> 01:49:04.943
It sure won't go away.

01:49:07.454 --> 01:49:08.944
We haven't talked since college.

01:49:11.825 --> 01:49:13.588
You wait two weeks
before my wedding...

01:49:13.627 --> 01:49:14.924
to tell me something like that?

01:49:16.230 --> 01:49:19.165
I know. I probably should
have said it two weeks ago.

01:49:20.467 --> 01:49:21.764
You haven't changed.

01:49:23.136 --> 01:49:26.105
You still think the sun rises
and sets on your ass.

01:49:27.207 --> 01:49:29.175
Guess what?
It doesn't.

01:49:30.010 --> 01:49:31.671
Then why are you so upset?

01:49:31.712 --> 01:49:34.681
Because you don't pull this
on someone about to get married.

01:49:34.715 --> 01:49:37.047
Better late than never, right?

01:49:37.084 --> 01:49:38.551
Wrong.

01:49:43.624 --> 01:49:44.784
I'll play you.

01:49:44.825 --> 01:49:46.122
What?

01:49:46.159 --> 01:49:48.320
One game, one-on-one.

01:49:48.362 --> 01:49:49.522
For what?

01:49:51.632 --> 01:49:52.963
Your heart.

01:49:55.435 --> 01:49:56.766
You're out of your mind.

01:49:56.803 --> 01:49:58.361
So, what, you gonna bitch up?

01:49:58.405 --> 01:50:01.670
Huh. What's that supposed
to be, some psychology?

01:50:01.708 --> 01:50:05.075
Look, I know why you broke up
with me in college...

01:50:05.112 --> 01:50:06.909
and not that
it wasn't messed up...

01:50:08.248 --> 01:50:11.149
but I should have been there
for you.

01:50:12.653 --> 01:50:15.417
I just didn't know how to do
that and be all about ball.

01:50:15.455 --> 01:50:19.585
Monica, after that stuff
with my dad...

01:50:20.794 --> 01:50:22.386
I couldn't trust anybody, OK?

01:50:24.064 --> 01:50:25.656
I was lost.

01:50:25.699 --> 01:50:28.190
That was five years ago.

01:50:28.235 --> 01:50:29.600
I've moved on.

01:50:31.905 --> 01:50:33.338
Prove it.

01:50:35.509 --> 01:50:37.170
What will this prove?

01:50:37.210 --> 01:50:39.371
You once said the reason
I beat you...

01:50:39.413 --> 01:50:41.210
was because you wanted me to.

01:50:41.248 --> 01:50:42.840
- So?
- So...

01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:45.240
if I win...

01:50:45.285 --> 01:50:47.082
it's because deep down
you know you're about to make...

01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:48.883
the biggest mistake
of your life.

01:50:51.591 --> 01:50:53.559
And deep down,
you want me to stop you.

01:50:56.229 --> 01:50:57.787
And what happens when you lose?

01:51:00.701 --> 01:51:02.191
If I lose...

01:51:04.304 --> 01:51:05.862
I'll buy you a wedding present.

01:51:10.544 --> 01:51:11.704
First to ten.

01:51:12.546 --> 01:51:13.706
To five.

01:51:14.514 --> 01:51:15.640
You scared?

01:51:15.682 --> 01:51:17.377
I have better things to do.

01:51:20.654 --> 01:51:21.814

01:51:26.893 --> 01:51:28.451

Check.

01:51:33.533 --> 01:51:34.727
Why don't you D-up this time?

01:51:40.540 --> 01:51:41.905
Two-zip.

01:51:53.153 --> 01:51:55.018
Three-zip. Where's the D?

01:51:55.055 --> 01:51:56.420
Sleepy?

01:51:58.425 --> 01:52:00.188
Your knee hurt?

01:52:00.227 --> 01:52:01.592
Come to play?

01:52:14.174 --> 01:52:15.869
So now you wanna play?

01:52:15.909 --> 01:52:17.672
Now you're takin' off
your brace, huh?

01:52:17.711 --> 01:52:19.406
Think that's gonna make you
play better?

01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:27.880
Check.

01:52:33.493 --> 01:52:34.653

01:52:41.868 --> 01:52:43.392

01:52:43.437 --> 01:52:44.631
Three up.

01:53:12.766 --> 01:53:14.063
I don't hear you talkin'.

01:53:15.268 --> 01:53:16.428
I don't hear you.

01:53:51.238 --> 01:53:52.398
Point.

01:55:04.044 --> 01:55:05.944
All's fair
in love and basketball, right?

01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:35.473
Double or nothin'.

01:56:37.003 --> 01:56:38.527
All right,
ladies and gentlemen...

01:56:38.571 --> 01:56:41.972
let's stand and welcome
your Los Angeles Sparks!

01:56:42.008 --> 01:56:44.943
Fifteen and six on the year,
