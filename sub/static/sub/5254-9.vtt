WEBVTT

00:00.010 --> 00:01.226
Previously on Faking It...

00:01.249 --> 00:02.961
Cluck-n-Go's a horrible corporation...

00:02.988 --> 00:04.355
Less talk and more eating.

00:04.357 --> 00:06.790
Don't eat that homophobic sandwich.

00:08.127 --> 00:09.560
There's a lot about me you don't know.

00:09.562 --> 00:11.161
I'm not your average girl.

00:11.163 --> 00:13.996
- You're not a phase to me.
- I slept with somebody.

00:13.998 --> 00:16.543
It's not like it was with Amy.

00:16.569 --> 00:18.036
Get out!

00:18.788 --> 00:19.684
_

00:24.975 --> 00:26.876
Morning, Shrimp Girl.

00:26.878 --> 00:29.045
You mean good morning, right?

00:29.047 --> 00:31.013
It is a very good morning,

00:31.015 --> 00:33.415
but it can't compete with last night.

00:33.417 --> 00:35.918
- That was really...
- Educational.

00:41.626 --> 00:43.092
I got to go.

00:43.719 --> 00:46.493
I'm catering a women's golf invitational.

00:46.519 --> 00:47.516
Want to come?

00:47.541 --> 00:48.868
_

00:50.333 --> 00:52.701
- Oh, my God.
- What happened?

00:52.703 --> 00:53.679
It's Karma.

00:53.705 --> 00:55.296
What's today's drama?

00:56.440 --> 00:58.173
Um...

00:58.175 --> 01:00.742
She... she reminded me
I have a huge test today,

01:00.744 --> 01:02.477
and I think I'm gonna fail.

01:02.479 --> 01:05.346
You'll be fine.

01:05.348 --> 01:07.949
You're a really fast learner.

01:10.779 --> 01:11.732
That goes right here.

01:11.758 --> 01:13.225
Please be sure that it's straight.

01:13.404 --> 01:15.036
Thank you. That goes up.

01:15.038 --> 01:16.004
Where are my balloons?

01:16.006 --> 01:17.939
What the hell is going on?

01:17.941 --> 01:19.174
Oh, just one of Penelope's

01:19.176 --> 01:21.076
day-long team building exercises.

01:21.078 --> 01:23.945
Last year we formed a conga
line against conformity.

01:23.947 --> 01:26.581
I'm the one who mocks this
place, not you. What gives?

01:26.583 --> 01:27.761
I just fired my trainer

01:27.787 --> 01:30.120
over our different fitness philosophies,

01:30.558 --> 01:32.605
but I'm confident he'll
come to his senses.

01:32.631 --> 01:34.764
In fact, I'm expecting a text any minute

01:34.790 --> 01:36.934
begging to get back together.

01:38.227 --> 01:39.832
Like, seriously.

01:40.764 --> 01:41.629
Any minute.

01:41.655 --> 01:43.254
Must suck to be in love limbo.

01:43.366 --> 01:44.348
I, on the other hand,

01:44.374 --> 01:46.374
told Theo that I was intersex last night,

01:46.469 --> 01:48.168
and he was completely accepting.

01:48.170 --> 01:49.904
He said all the right things.

01:49.906 --> 01:53.640
Good, because I'm not up for
another kidnapping right now.

01:53.642 --> 01:54.608
Have either of you seen Karma?

01:54.610 --> 01:56.510
Mm-mm.

01:56.512 --> 01:58.946
I need to find her. She
knows about me and Liam.

01:58.948 --> 02:01.282
She knows? You know?

02:01.284 --> 02:03.050
Can we please stay focused here?

02:03.052 --> 02:04.684
- Sorry.
- What can we do to help?

02:04.686 --> 02:06.753
There's nothing you can
do. There's no fixing this.

02:06.755 --> 02:08.221
Our friendship is over.

02:08.223 --> 02:10.256
Well, at least we're in public.

02:10.258 --> 02:12.626
Plenty of witnesses. She'll
probably let you live.

02:12.628 --> 02:13.860
Oh, if I were in Karma's shoes,

02:13.862 --> 02:15.328
that would not stop me from going

02:15.330 --> 02:17.864
all Solange-in-an-elevator on your ass.

02:17.866 --> 02:19.533
- What?
- Sorry.

02:19.535 --> 02:20.534
Forgot we were being supportive.

02:23.838 --> 02:28.741
Are you ready to role-play?

02:30.738 --> 02:33.313
You're getting out of class
for the day, so fake it.

02:34.582 --> 02:35.881
Okay, yeah. That was better.

02:35.883 --> 02:39.284
Now, this year, we are going to be forming

02:39.286 --> 02:41.921
our very own future civilization,

02:41.923 --> 02:43.923
a society I'm calling...

02:43.925 --> 02:46.058
Hesteria!

02:46.060 --> 02:48.761
Hesteria will be divided
into four distinct classes.

02:48.763 --> 02:51.396
So soon you'll each draw lots
to determine your clantribe.

02:51.398 --> 02:53.966
You will dip your hands
into the bowl of designation

02:53.968 --> 02:55.800
to determine your fate, your destiny...

02:55.802 --> 02:57.102
Oh, God. There she is.

02:57.104 --> 02:58.937
- Okay.
- I have personally designed

02:58.939 --> 03:01.620
each clantribe to
maximize dramatic tension.

03:03.243 --> 03:04.876
Karma...

03:10.716 --> 03:13.050
Is it true?

03:13.052 --> 03:15.219
I'm so sorry.

03:23.729 --> 03:25.196
I'm the one who's sorry.

03:25.198 --> 03:27.732
I'm sorry you had to
go through this alone.

03:30.169 --> 03:32.772
Synced and corrected by Chitorafa
www.addic7ed.com

03:32.798 --> 03:34.005
Okay, you're representing Hesteria.

03:34.007 --> 03:38.242
- So smile. Smile!
- Here you go.

03:38.244 --> 03:41.326
So you don't hate me?
Not even a little bit?

03:41.352 --> 03:43.347
Amy, this isn't your fault.

03:43.349 --> 03:46.383
The only person to blame
here is Liam [Bleep] Booker.

03:46.385 --> 03:49.753
He took advantage of you the one
time you were most vulnerable.

03:49.755 --> 03:54.925
'Cause I know you wouldn't
betray me like that, right?

03:54.927 --> 03:57.293
Yep. That's... that's what happened.

03:57.295 --> 03:59.462
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

03:59.464 --> 04:01.898
Um, well, I wanted to,
but, well, the thing is...

04:01.900 --> 04:03.500
Liam forced you not to.

04:03.502 --> 04:06.369
I knew it! He's such a
master manipulating monster.

04:06.371 --> 04:09.172
I can't believe it took
me so long to see it.

04:09.174 --> 04:11.841
All right, Hesterians, time
to discover which clantribe

04:11.843 --> 04:13.500
you will be assigned to.

04:14.746 --> 04:16.446
I'm a Raindweller?

04:16.447 --> 04:17.414
Yes.

04:17.416 --> 04:19.180
Raindwellers are the servile class.

04:19.183 --> 04:20.916
They tend to the needs of the elite,

04:20.918 --> 04:22.919
aristocratic clantribe, the Cloudspinners.

04:22.921 --> 04:24.987
- That's me.
- You are a lucky girl.

04:24.989 --> 04:27.189
Cloudspinners hold all the power.

04:27.191 --> 04:29.391
- Their very word is law.
- Hmm.

04:29.393 --> 04:31.060
You even get to select
a faithful Raindweller

04:31.062 --> 04:32.428
to serve you.

04:35.331 --> 04:38.667
- Um, maybe we should switch.
- No, you can't switch.

04:38.669 --> 04:40.602
That defeats the entire purpose
of the social experiment.

04:40.604 --> 04:41.937
Amy, it's fine.

04:41.939 --> 04:43.605
Well, I thought as a Saladspinner...

04:43.607 --> 04:44.839
You're a Cloudspinner.

04:44.841 --> 04:46.608
Um, I thought my word was law,

04:46.610 --> 04:50.312
so I hereby decree that
switching is allowed.

04:50.314 --> 04:52.380
White is more my color.

04:55.118 --> 04:56.818
I know she won't take me back,

04:56.820 --> 04:58.086
but I just need Karma to understand

04:58.088 --> 04:59.721
that it meant nothing.

04:59.723 --> 05:02.290
I was heartbroken, and I made
the biggest mistake of my life.

05:02.292 --> 05:05.060
You think you have it bad? What about Amy?

05:05.062 --> 05:08.162
Karma's gonna kill her.

05:08.164 --> 05:12.600
Kill her with kindness apparently.

05:12.602 --> 05:14.602
That's weird.

05:14.604 --> 05:15.736
If she's forgiven Amy,

05:15.738 --> 05:17.472
maybe that means she'll forgive me too.

05:17.474 --> 05:18.573
Next.

05:20.542 --> 05:21.976
I'm a Mudmover?

05:21.978 --> 05:22.965
Same.

05:22.991 --> 05:25.224
Mudmovers are the lowest social order.

05:25.748 --> 05:27.047
Scum of the Earth, basically.

05:27.049 --> 05:28.515
That sounds about right.

05:28.517 --> 05:30.985
In what messed-up future
would I be a Mudmover?

05:30.987 --> 05:33.453
And where the [Bleep] is...

05:33.455 --> 05:35.489
Theo.

05:40.795 --> 05:42.729
Uh, hey, you.

05:42.731 --> 05:43.801
How weird is all this?

05:43.827 --> 05:45.549
Brandi and I are both Firedancers.

05:45.575 --> 05:48.768
Hey-ho, we're the po-po, yo!

05:48.770 --> 05:50.337
Uh-huh.

05:50.339 --> 05:53.240
Or, Theo, you could
trade places with Leila.

05:53.242 --> 05:54.707
Oh, Theo, don't go.

05:54.709 --> 05:55.942
Who else is going to go splitsies with me

05:55.944 --> 05:58.177
on that pot brownie I just got?

05:58.179 --> 05:59.545
This game's going to be so much better

05:59.547 --> 06:01.080
when we're tripping our balls off.

06:01.082 --> 06:02.548
[Bleep] off, Brandi.

06:02.550 --> 06:05.084
Theo's not a pothead,
burnout loser like you.

06:05.086 --> 06:06.819
He's switching with Leila.

06:06.821 --> 06:09.656
Actually, I think I should go with Brandi.

06:09.658 --> 06:12.224
Play by the rules.

06:12.226 --> 06:14.193
- What? But...
- Just think of it this way.

06:14.195 --> 06:16.228
You're a Mudmover. I'm a Firedancer.

06:16.230 --> 06:18.631
We're star-crossed
lovers. Kind of hot, right?

06:21.434 --> 06:24.303
Wait, Karma.

06:25.972 --> 06:28.307
Glad to see you've had
the time to cool down.

06:28.309 --> 06:30.542
I mean, now we can talk.

06:30.544 --> 06:32.443
I've got nothing to say to you.

06:32.445 --> 06:35.413
Stay away from me, from both of us.

06:37.150 --> 06:39.450
Karma, you can't just shut me out.

06:39.452 --> 06:41.486
Um, actually, she's a Cloudspinner,

06:41.488 --> 06:42.921
so, technically, she can.

06:42.923 --> 06:45.290
And as a cloudspinny-person,

06:45.292 --> 06:49.460
I don't want his kind anywhere near me.

06:49.462 --> 06:52.029
Firedancers, remove this Mudmover.

06:52.031 --> 06:53.464
Really?

06:53.466 --> 06:55.866
- You think I'm afraid of those?
- You should be.

06:55.868 --> 06:57.402
If they shoot you, then you're dead,

06:57.404 --> 06:58.936
and you are banished to the subbasement,

06:58.938 --> 07:00.938
where you'll be watching old
abstinence education films.

07:00.940 --> 07:03.373
The state of Texas
requires me to show them.

07:03.375 --> 07:05.275
Trust me, they're torture.

07:08.046 --> 07:09.446
Let's go, scum.

07:09.448 --> 07:11.849
Eyes forward, buddy.

07:11.851 --> 07:13.784
Hurry up, punk.

07:15.688 --> 07:17.665
_

07:17.691 --> 07:21.680
_

07:21.706 --> 07:22.734
_

07:22.760 --> 07:26.763
- Oh, writing quite the novel there, I see.
- _

07:26.765 --> 07:28.198
You okay, Liam?

07:28.200 --> 07:29.833
Karma can't ignore me forever.

07:29.835 --> 07:31.335
- If I keep up my texting barrage,
- _

07:31.337 --> 07:33.036
she'll have to respond eventually.

07:33.038 --> 07:34.771
You know, maybe she's
not getting your texts.

07:34.773 --> 07:36.439
None of my texts seem to
be coming through either.

07:36.441 --> 07:38.775
I'm thinking there's a sun flare.

07:38.777 --> 07:41.177
Attention, Mudmovers!

07:41.179 --> 07:43.546
Because some among you can't seem

07:43.548 --> 07:46.216
to control your textual impulses,

07:46.218 --> 07:47.516
the Cloudspinners decree

07:47.518 --> 07:49.385
you should all relinquish your phones.

07:49.387 --> 07:50.553
What?

07:52.723 --> 07:55.291
- Sorry, guys.
- You can't be serious.

07:55.293 --> 07:56.992
Don't make me use this, bro.

07:58.000 --> 08:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:05.969 --> 08:07.336
Amy, what the [Bleep]?

08:07.338 --> 08:08.871
Why is Karma forgiving you and blaming me?

08:08.873 --> 08:10.639
What did you tell her?

08:10.641 --> 08:11.874
I'm not the one who's been
saying things I shouldn't.

08:11.876 --> 08:13.208
You swore you'd never tell.

08:13.210 --> 08:14.209
I'm sorry I broke that promise,

08:14.211 --> 08:15.485
but this isn't fair.

08:15.511 --> 08:17.789
We both wanted to hurt Karma
that night, and you know it.

08:18.173 --> 08:20.282
You're letting me take the fall.

08:20.284 --> 08:23.418
I thought you had more
integrity than that.

08:27.805 --> 08:29.639
Enjoy.

08:35.647 --> 08:37.481
Bye.

08:38.318 --> 08:38.948
Oh!

08:38.951 --> 08:42.385
Sorry, no Mudmovers
allowed beyond this point.

08:42.388 --> 08:44.153
Since you didn't seem to
hear me the first time,

08:44.155 --> 08:45.221
I'll say it again.

08:45.223 --> 08:47.304
[Bleep] off, Brandi,

08:47.330 --> 08:48.958
and also, stay away from Theo.

08:48.960 --> 08:52.021
He's not going to be
eating your special brownie.

08:52.047 --> 08:55.665
Hmm, it's looking like he
prefers brownie to Blondie.

09:02.141 --> 09:03.809
Okay. Look alive, people.

09:03.811 --> 09:05.544
We need to break into
the Cloudspinners' lair.

09:05.546 --> 09:07.846
Liam, you need your phone,
so you can talk to Karma.

09:07.848 --> 09:08.842
Shane, you need your phone,

09:08.868 --> 09:10.868
so you can stare at it
pathetically until Duke texts.

09:10.894 --> 09:13.028
And I need to keep Theo away
from that slut-faced stoner.

09:13.054 --> 09:15.053
So why are we just sitting around?

09:15.381 --> 09:17.186
Lauren's right. We need a plan.

09:17.212 --> 09:18.446
One that won't get us fake-killed

09:18.462 --> 09:20.127
and banished to the subbasement.

09:20.129 --> 09:21.863
If only we could do the
old Trojan horse trick,

09:21.865 --> 09:24.098
but they'd see that coming a mile away.

09:25.534 --> 09:28.035
Like the Trojan horse from <i>The Iliad</i> ?

09:30.138 --> 09:31.905
We're reading it in third period English.

09:31.907 --> 09:33.607
You're both in my class.

09:33.609 --> 09:35.977
- I was going to skim it.
- I've been preoccupied.

09:35.979 --> 09:37.878
Okay.

09:37.880 --> 09:41.648
If everyone else is as
oblivious as you two,

09:41.650 --> 09:44.452
this might actually work.

09:44.454 --> 09:46.187
Thank you.

09:46.189 --> 09:49.723
I think they shouldn't be
allowed to look us in the eye,

09:49.725 --> 09:52.826
and we should tax them
half their lunch money.

09:52.828 --> 09:54.962
All of these ideas suck.

09:54.964 --> 09:57.197
I want him to really suffer.

09:57.199 --> 09:58.899
Him?

09:58.901 --> 10:00.934
Did I say "him"?

10:00.936 --> 10:05.271
I meant those filthy Mudmovers.

10:05.273 --> 10:07.807
Maybe you guys should
lighten up on the Mudmovers.

10:07.809 --> 10:09.309
If we'd drawn a different lot,

10:09.311 --> 10:11.611
we could easily be in their place.

10:14.348 --> 10:17.492
In fact, Karma...

10:18.353 --> 10:20.601
There's something you need to know.

10:21.455 --> 10:22.734
What is it?

10:23.791 --> 10:25.925
I just, um...

10:30.296 --> 10:33.900
I heard that there's diet root beer

10:33.902 --> 10:35.868
over there on the snack
table, your favorite.

10:35.870 --> 10:39.138
- Let me go grab you one.
- Best friend ever.

10:39.140 --> 10:42.041
And can you pour it over ice, please?

10:43.609 --> 10:47.146
Aren't you worried that Karma
may be taking this a bit far?

10:47.148 --> 10:49.448
No, I mean, it's just
a stupid game, right?

10:49.450 --> 10:52.584
That's what they said about
the Stanford prison experiment.

10:52.586 --> 10:54.719
What's that? It sounds
like a bad jam band.

10:54.721 --> 10:56.588
No, it really happened.

10:56.590 --> 10:59.024
They divided students
into prisoners and guards,

10:59.026 --> 11:00.926
and the guards ended up
getting so drunk with power

11:00.928 --> 11:03.562
that they did horrible things.

11:03.564 --> 11:06.330
Could I get that diet soda today, please?

11:13.905 --> 11:15.839
What is she doing here?

11:15.841 --> 11:18.008
She's a filthy Mudmover.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.510
We lowly Mudmovers offer

11:19.512 --> 11:22.480
our Cloudspinner overlords
this tribute as a token

11:22.482 --> 11:24.848
of our fealty and obedience.

11:27.452 --> 11:30.087
We accept this tribute.

11:30.089 --> 11:32.056
Guys, hey! Hey, guys!

11:32.058 --> 11:35.358
That's clearly a Trojan horse.

11:35.360 --> 11:38.361
Give us our phones,
and nobody gets nerfed.

11:38.363 --> 11:39.663
Off with her head!

11:39.665 --> 11:40.998
Big words, Lisbeth.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.132
But tomorrow this game will be over,

11:42.134 --> 11:44.501
and then where will you be?

11:44.503 --> 11:48.871
The tiny blonde Mudmover
is under my protection.

11:51.442 --> 11:53.676
I told you to stay away.

11:53.678 --> 11:55.112
Karma, please, just listen to me.

11:55.114 --> 11:56.679
Why, so you can tell me more lies?

11:56.681 --> 12:01.117
We were heartbroken and angry
and really, really drunk.

12:01.119 --> 12:03.519
We both wanted to hurt you
in the worst way possible.

12:03.521 --> 12:05.661
Amy, back me up.

12:06.949 --> 12:09.859
- Karma...
- You leave her out of this!

12:09.861 --> 12:12.261
There's no excuse I can give you.

12:12.263 --> 12:14.497
I know that.

12:14.499 --> 12:18.767
But you made me feel things
that I've never felt before.

12:18.769 --> 12:22.538
Oh, so now it's my fault for
giving Liam Booker feelings?

12:22.540 --> 12:24.373
No, it's our fault. We did this, Amy.

12:24.375 --> 12:25.341
Amy, tell her!

12:25.343 --> 12:27.009
Stop saying "we"!

12:27.011 --> 12:29.178
I get that you'll never forgive me.

12:29.180 --> 12:32.547
But I just need you
to know that I loved...

12:32.549 --> 12:36.317
No, I love you.

12:39.890 --> 12:42.858
Karma.

12:44.494 --> 12:46.895
Go to hell.

12:49.899 --> 12:51.899
Fine.

12:51.901 --> 12:55.736
I'll go to hell, if that's what you want.

13:00.443 --> 13:02.335
This isn't over!

13:03.180 --> 13:05.846
Can you believe he tried
to take you down with him?

13:10.262 --> 13:11.662
All right, Mudmovers, move out!

13:11.664 --> 13:13.597
- Liam! Liam! Liam!
- Mudmovers, come on.

13:14.576 --> 13:16.544
Keep it moving, scum.

13:17.022 --> 13:18.822
Unbelievable!

13:18.824 --> 13:20.457
Shane turned Liam into a martyr

13:20.459 --> 13:22.793
like he's a [Bleep]
mockingjay or something.

13:22.795 --> 13:25.796
Really? I'm getting more of
an Obama-hopey-changey vibe.

13:25.798 --> 13:27.564
I'm not going to let
him get away with this.

13:27.566 --> 13:29.065
We're going to expose Liam Booker

13:29.067 --> 13:31.334
for what he really is.

13:31.336 --> 13:33.303
Which is what, a werewolf?

13:36.407 --> 13:40.310
I never told you this, but
Liam's family owns Skwerkel.

13:40.312 --> 13:42.384
He's a liar and a hypocrite,

13:42.410 --> 13:44.845
protesting a company
he'll inherit one day.

13:46.283 --> 13:48.283
You've already publicly executed him.

13:48.285 --> 13:50.586
Wouldn't doing more be
the definition of overkill?

13:50.588 --> 13:52.072
I thought that I could avoid Liam,

13:52.088 --> 13:53.688
but clearly, that's not possible.

13:53.690 --> 13:55.690
So I'm just going to
destroy his reputation

13:55.692 --> 13:57.959
till he's so despised, he
has to transfer schools.

13:57.961 --> 13:59.994
Karma, this is real-life stuff.

13:59.996 --> 14:01.762
If feels like you're crossing a line.

14:01.764 --> 14:03.564
He crossed the line first, didn't he?

14:05.168 --> 14:06.589
Now please go tell Penelope

14:06.615 --> 14:09.349
that I'm calling an
assembly in the cafeteria.

14:09.405 --> 14:11.239
And hurry.

14:16.345 --> 14:18.044
- Put that on there.
- Thank you.

14:18.046 --> 14:20.280
Cock that back. Now shoot.

14:20.282 --> 14:23.116
This Mudmover is under my protection.

14:23.118 --> 14:24.752
They get it, Lisbeth!

14:24.754 --> 14:26.086
Theo, can I talk to you?

14:26.088 --> 14:28.221
Sure, what's up?

14:30.291 --> 14:31.892
I want the truth. Just tell me now.

14:31.894 --> 14:34.560
Did you eat Brandi's brownie
figuratively or literally?

14:34.562 --> 14:36.496
I told you I'm not into drugs,

14:36.498 --> 14:38.731
and I'm not into Brandi
either... I like you, Lauren.

14:38.733 --> 14:40.666
Then why did you want to avoid me all day?

14:40.668 --> 14:41.768
Is it because...

14:41.770 --> 14:43.503
Okay, now I get what this is about.

14:43.505 --> 14:45.138
You shared something huge with me,

14:45.140 --> 14:46.172
and now you think I'm changing my mind.

14:46.174 --> 14:49.342
What? No. I...

14:49.344 --> 14:51.577
Okay, yes. Are you?

14:51.579 --> 14:53.880
No. I meant what I said last night.

14:53.882 --> 14:56.616
I don't care that you were
born a little different.

14:56.618 --> 14:59.151
I think you are the strongest,
sexiest, most amazing girl

14:59.153 --> 15:01.621
I've ever met.

15:01.623 --> 15:04.110
No matter what happens,
nothing will ever change that.

15:04.136 --> 15:05.901
Then why does it always feel
like you're pulling away?

15:05.927 --> 15:07.393
I feel like I'm going crazy.

15:07.395 --> 15:09.295
There's something you need to know.

15:09.297 --> 15:10.662
I wanted to tell you
earlier, but I couldn't.

15:10.664 --> 15:12.431
Attention, citizens of Hesteria.

15:12.433 --> 15:14.103
By the order of the Cloudspinners,

15:14.129 --> 15:16.912
all clantribes are to assemble
in the cafeteria immediately.

15:16.938 --> 15:18.589
[Bleep] Karma!

15:18.615 --> 15:20.831
Meet me in the courtyard after
school. I'll explain everything.

15:21.042 --> 15:23.475
Okay.

15:25.628 --> 15:32.025
Liam! Liam! Liam! Liam! Liam! Liam!

15:32.051 --> 15:34.252
Remember Liam! Never forget.

15:34.254 --> 15:35.987
He died for our phones!

15:35.989 --> 15:37.889
We are all Liam!

15:37.891 --> 15:39.458
I am Liam.

15:39.460 --> 15:44.737
I am Liam! I am Liam!
I am Liam! I am Liam!

15:45.765 --> 15:48.232
Attention, Mudmovers,

15:48.210 --> 15:50.583
you all think that your
precious martyr Liam

15:50.609 --> 15:51.675
is so perfect?

15:51.871 --> 15:53.838
Well, I have news for you.

15:53.840 --> 15:55.239
Karma, don't do this.

15:55.241 --> 15:57.274
He's not who you think he is.

15:57.276 --> 15:59.795
Remember when we were
all protesting Skwerkel,

15:59.821 --> 16:01.688
and Liam was our fearless leader?

16:02.014 --> 16:04.348
Well, it turns out...

16:06.852 --> 16:09.086
I'm sorry.

16:09.088 --> 16:10.988
Amy, did you just kill me?

16:10.990 --> 16:12.456
It was for your own good.

16:12.458 --> 16:16.259
Now you have to stop talking
and go to the basement.

16:19.563 --> 16:21.631
Die, traitorous assassin.

16:21.633 --> 16:24.734
Oh! Okay, okay, I get it.

16:24.736 --> 16:26.936
I'll go too.

16:26.938 --> 16:30.773
They made us wear these brown
sacks, and they took our phones.

16:30.775 --> 16:34.377
Who knows what important
texts we're missing?

16:34.379 --> 16:36.946
They can't Nerf us all!

16:36.948 --> 16:38.615
<i>¡Viva la revolución!</i>

16:42.686 --> 16:44.053
Kill them all!

16:48.158 --> 16:51.460
Liam! Liam! Liam!

16:54.952 --> 16:57.889
Do you remember when you
told me that I might...

16:58.310 --> 17:00.344
I might have such strong
feelings about a boy

17:00.346 --> 17:03.446
that it might be hard for me
to decide what's right to do?

17:03.448 --> 17:07.150
It was something like
that tonight with Jeff.

17:07.152 --> 17:08.517
You know, I like him an awful lot,

17:08.519 --> 17:12.222
and we... we have such fun dances.

17:12.223 --> 17:14.790
But tonight, the feeling between us

17:14.791 --> 17:18.093
kept getting stronger and stronger.

17:18.095 --> 17:19.895
Okay, it's been, like, 15 minutes.

17:19.896 --> 17:21.396
Karma, say something.

17:21.398 --> 17:24.333
Fine, I will.

17:25.435 --> 17:26.769
How could you?

17:26.771 --> 17:28.704
I couldn't let you do something

17:28.706 --> 17:30.773
you would regret forever,

17:30.775 --> 17:33.008
just like when you rein
me in if I go too far.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.509
Telling everyone Liam's family secret...

17:34.511 --> 17:36.111
- Wait.
- Which is...

17:36.113 --> 17:38.413
Karma, you were really going to do that?

17:38.415 --> 17:40.448
You said the truth was
so important to you,

17:40.450 --> 17:42.217
but you're filled with secrets.

17:42.219 --> 17:45.354
Someone had to expose you
for the fraud that you are.

17:45.356 --> 17:46.621
Don't like it?

17:46.623 --> 17:48.857
Go cry to your rich mommy about it.

17:48.859 --> 17:50.725
Karma, come on. Lay off.

17:50.727 --> 17:53.806
Liam's family stuff is a lot
more complicated than that.

17:58.768 --> 18:00.935
Wait, how the hell would you know?

18:09.278 --> 18:11.445
Was this more than a one-time thing?

18:11.447 --> 18:13.147
No, it was one time.

18:13.149 --> 18:14.193
I only went to Liam's house

18:14.219 --> 18:15.893
to keep him from telling you about us.

18:15.919 --> 18:19.853
So Liam wanted to tell
me, but you stopped him?

18:19.855 --> 18:21.755
Karma, it's not like that.

18:21.757 --> 18:24.507
Amy was just trying to save you the pain.

18:25.193 --> 18:26.507
No.

18:27.996 --> 18:29.963
It is like that.

18:29.965 --> 18:33.266
I was selfish. I couldn't face what I did.

18:33.268 --> 18:35.239
It was horrible. It was the
worst thing I've ever done.

18:35.265 --> 18:37.536
The worst thing I could ever do.

18:38.474 --> 18:40.740
But you can't blame Liam and not me.

18:44.045 --> 18:46.776
Either you forgive us both, or...

18:47.582 --> 18:49.715
you hate us both.

18:54.936 --> 18:56.133
Fine.

18:57.459 --> 18:59.559
Then I hate you both.

19:01.225 --> 19:02.624
Experiment's over, guys.

19:02.650 --> 19:03.803
Karma?

19:04.676 --> 19:05.897
Uh...

19:07.435 --> 19:09.896
Oh, okay.

19:15.254 --> 19:16.586
Hey, you get that text
you were waiting for?

19:16.588 --> 19:18.655
Ah, no, just a Skwerkel-alert saying

19:18.657 --> 19:21.225
Duke signed with
Cluck-n-Go and grew a beard.

19:21.227 --> 19:22.692
And not in the sexy way,

19:22.694 --> 19:24.962
in the "Taylor Swift
dating Taylor Lautner" way.

19:24.964 --> 19:27.246
Well, I think you're
better off without him.

19:27.272 --> 19:28.872
I wish I believed that.

19:28.898 --> 19:30.066
Now if you'll excuse me,

19:30.092 --> 19:31.441
I'm gonna go fall into a black hole

19:31.467 --> 19:34.471
of cyber-stalking and
pinkberry. Care to join?

19:34.497 --> 19:35.639
No, thanks. I'm waiting for Theo.

19:35.641 --> 19:38.040
Passing up fro-yo for Theo?

19:38.042 --> 19:39.976
He really must be the one.

20:03.701 --> 20:06.553
