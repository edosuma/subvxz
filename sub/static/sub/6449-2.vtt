that call themselves crime ﬁghters.

35:08.314 --> 35:11.602
They think we should all
remain hidden in the shadows.

35:13.611 --> 35:16.444
They tried to torture her, Clark.

35:17.532 --> 35:21.150
But she beat them at their own game.
She took a cyanide pill.

35:21.744 --> 35:24.611
-No, Chloe wouldn't--
-And then she took this.

35:25.414 --> 35:27.871
I found that at her apartment,
had it tested...

35:28.084 --> 35:32.874
...and there's traces
of a cyanide antidote in there.

35:35.883 --> 35:37.623
She faked her own death.

35:42.765 --> 35:45.142
She was planning to go.

35:46.310 --> 35:48.801
She saw the future.

35:49.438 --> 35:52.350
She put on Dr. Fate's helmet
trying to ﬁnd you...

35:52.525 --> 35:54.607
...and said it was gonna be okay.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.684
You just let her go?

35:56.904 --> 35:58.485
I had no idea she was leaving.

35:58.698 --> 36:01.189
She put on the Fate helmet.
That should've told you.

36:01.367 --> 36:03.198
I understand
how much she means to you.

36:03.369 --> 36:05.860
But she's been asking us
to treat her as one of us.

36:06.038 --> 36:10.407
She begged me to trust her
and the decisions that she made.

36:10.585 --> 36:13.918
If she put this much thought into leaving,
she knew what she was doing.

36:14.088 --> 36:17.046
I go out, I protect unfamiliar faces
so they can go home...

36:17.216 --> 36:19.207
...and be with the people
they care about.

36:19.385 --> 36:22.548
And the one person that I should have
been protecting the most....

36:27.101 --> 36:28.307
I failed her.

36:28.895 --> 36:31.887
We didn't choose this. We know
this is what we were born to do.

36:32.064 --> 36:34.976
Playing the fate card?
Is that what gets you through the day?

36:35.151 --> 36:37.392
You do nothing
while these people we protect...

36:37.570 --> 36:39.606
...they paint us as vigilantes, Clark.

36:39.780 --> 36:41.862
The woman that you love ran away.

36:42.074 --> 36:44.690
You think I don't wanna get Lois
and bring her back?

36:45.786 --> 36:48.448
They left us, Oliver.

36:49.373 --> 36:51.329
With our lives, we can't blame them.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.456
Well, what if we hadn't remained hidden?

36:56.797 --> 36:57.957
Huh?

36:58.132 --> 37:01.966
What if we didn't put our identities
out there to be held hostage?

37:02.136 --> 37:03.842
Would this still be happening?

37:05.431 --> 37:08.673
Clark, I think we have to forge
a new fate here.

37:08.893 --> 37:11.179
We've lost way too much.

37:14.190 --> 37:16.272
Something's gotta change.

37:39.590 --> 37:41.922
Not even a hello?

37:42.885 --> 37:47.345
Rotting in jail
ain't my idea of a good time.

37:49.642 --> 37:51.382
Your draw.

37:56.941 --> 37:58.772
You nailed your target.

37:58.943 --> 38:00.899
Now let's get you out of here.

38:07.910 --> 38:09.241
About time.

38:09.412 --> 38:12.154
-l'm sorry, what's redneck for "bite me"?
-Plastique.

38:12.331 --> 38:16.540
Sir, our costumed counterparts
are ofﬁcially tagged and released.

38:16.711 --> 38:18.793
As soon as we spring Wyatt Earp
over here...

38:18.963 --> 38:21.170
...we can track their every move.

38:21.340 --> 38:26.050
Let's give these boys a taste of what
it's like to mess with the Suicide Squad.

38:30.391 --> 38:32.131
CARTER:
Lois.

38:33.311 --> 38:34.972
About last night, I'm sorry.

38:35.146 --> 38:38.809
I guess I got a little too caught up
in my story.

38:38.983 --> 38:41.770
You forgot to mention
the most important part.

38:42.570 --> 38:44.356
It was an autobiography.

38:46.240 --> 38:48.231
I found this in the book.

38:57.001 --> 39:01.791
-Lois, surely you don't think that—?
-Let's just say I wasn't born yesterday.

39:01.964 --> 39:06.924
You're not the only one
of Clark's friends with a mysterious past.

39:07.136 --> 39:10.799
Clark did say
you were wise beyond your years.

39:12.350 --> 39:15.808
I hope last night
will remain between us.

39:15.978 --> 39:19.596
I'm not sure Clark
would forgive me if he knew.

39:19.774 --> 39:23.016
Some leads are better left buried.

39:23.778 --> 39:27.942
If you were here to babysit as a favor,
what was with the heart-to-heart?

39:28.115 --> 39:33.155
Something tells me that story time
wasn't exactly part of the agreement.

39:33.329 --> 39:36.287
It's my wife.

39:36.749 --> 39:40.537
I've been hearing her in my thoughts.
And last night, I had a vision of her.

39:40.711 --> 39:44.954
When that happens, I know
I'll be joining her soon in a new life.

39:45.132 --> 39:49.045
But to do that, I must ﬁrst leave this one.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.051
Leave.

39:51.472 --> 39:53.212
Like die?

39:53.432 --> 39:56.640
It's time I meet my destiny, Lois.

39:58.020 --> 40:01.478
But before I go,
I wanted you to meet yours.

40:02.691 --> 40:05.228
He can't do it without you.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.481
You're his Shayera.

40:09.198 --> 40:14.488
Carter, I am not like you
and Shayera and Clark.

40:17.373 --> 40:20.365
My future is here in Africa.

40:22.336 --> 40:27.080
Nietzsche believed we shouldn't live
for the future, but for the present.

40:27.883 --> 40:31.171
He thought that people who chased
after some far-off future dream...

40:31.345 --> 40:34.337
...were really running away
from their true destiny.

40:35.099 --> 40:37.636
Well, Nietzsche
can call me a chicken if he wants.

40:37.810 --> 40:40.142
But he has never dated someone
like Clark Kent.

40:40.354 --> 40:42.015
It wouldn't have mattered.

40:42.189 --> 40:45.101
To him, the true hero was the person
who embraced the life...

40:45.276 --> 40:48.564
...that he or she was given
and made it better.

40:48.737 --> 40:51.604
He called that person Ubermensch.

40:54.743 --> 40:56.904
A superman.

40:57.121 --> 41:00.033
Nietzsche believed that all of us
could be one.

41:01.125 --> 41:02.535
In our own way.
