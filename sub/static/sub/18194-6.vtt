<i>Previously on</i> The Royals...

00:03.078 --> 00:06.708
Might I apologize for telling
Your Majesty to shut up?

00:06.898 --> 00:10.882
And for the other demands?
We shall not speak of it.

00:11.351 --> 00:13.812
'600 years ago,
there was a young queen

00:13.878 --> 00:16.111
and she fell for her bodyguard.

00:16.168 --> 00:19.031
They started this epic love affair.

00:19.097 --> 00:21.375
They would write the most
romantic love letters

00:21.507 --> 00:23.546
and hide them
in a hollowed-out book.'

00:23.812 --> 00:25.914
There are a million reasons
why we can't do this.

00:25.959 --> 00:28.492
I can think
of one big reason why...

00:32.034 --> 00:34.140
Your blood claim to the throne

00:34.226 --> 00:36.523
how do you propose
we deal with that?

00:36.617 --> 00:39.180
Cyrus has agreed to a Privy Council.

00:39.250 --> 00:42.554
How on earth did you
get him to agree to that?

00:42.770 --> 00:45.337
I made him think it was his idea.

00:48.385 --> 00:50.960
'Love, Eleanor.

00:51.021 --> 00:54.984
Ps - yes, I said love and I meant it.

00:55.539 --> 00:59.382
Tomorrow is Christmas,
my favorite day of the year

00:59.734 --> 01:02.554
and you're the gift
I've wished for all my life.'

Ho, ho, ho!

03:33.350 --> 03:37.152
- Hell of a run.
- Hey. Didn't see you there.

03:37.177 --> 03:39.714
Little excessive for
Christmas Eve, isn't it?

03:39.808 --> 03:42.589
Are you running towards
or away from something?

03:42.659 --> 03:44.459
Just running.

03:45.198 --> 03:46.902
Merry Christmas.

03:46.941 --> 03:49.464
Don't Americans prefer
"Happy Holidays"?

03:50.550 --> 03:51.964
Full disclosure.

03:51.995 --> 03:55.448
I've dedicated a few
resources to your back story.

03:55.573 --> 03:57.905
It turns out your parents
were charlatans.

03:58.742 --> 04:00.675
"Are" charlatans.

04:00.816 --> 04:02.877
- And so are you.
- Was.

04:02.948 --> 04:05.597
It's funny, isn't it,
the happy Christmas thing.

04:06.090 --> 04:07.859
Somehow, wishing someone
a nice day

04:07.916 --> 04:09.349
has become offensive

04:09.392 --> 04:11.597
if you don't wish them
the exact day they believe in

04:11.688 --> 04:13.855
in the exact language they prefer.

04:13.857 --> 04:15.890
Some people are
just questioning tradition.

04:15.892 --> 04:18.857
Nothing wrong with tradition, rules.

04:19.326 --> 04:21.262
For instance,
I can't help notice

04:21.264 --> 04:22.935
that you're in the family gym.

04:23.193 --> 04:26.240
- I cleared that with...
- Ted pryce.

04:26.295 --> 04:28.591
I'm happy to join a gym,
your highness.

04:28.630 --> 04:31.193
The same Ted pryce
that you uncovered.

04:31.240 --> 04:33.007
For that I am indebted to you.

04:33.880 --> 04:36.811
Access to the gym
is the least we can do.

04:36.873 --> 04:40.302
But access to your sister
is a different matter.

04:40.959 --> 04:42.740
That's one thing
I like about Americans -

04:42.786 --> 04:45.201
they're direct,
they cut to the chase.

04:45.263 --> 04:47.740
I'm not very adept
about being indirect.

04:47.846 --> 04:50.113
Good. Nor am I.

04:50.998 --> 04:54.729
Len has good instincts. I'm
sure she's right about you.

04:55.750 --> 04:57.850
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

05:01.412 --> 05:03.211
Jasper.

05:04.541 --> 05:08.412
- Happy holidays.
- Merry Christmas.

05:12.916 --> 05:14.662
Enter!

05:24.095 --> 05:26.045
Stupid Christmas comes around,

05:26.080 --> 05:28.447
so everyone
gets hopped up on eggnog

05:28.480 --> 05:30.447
and forgets their station.

05:32.765 --> 05:34.565
Hello.

05:37.468 --> 05:39.435
Queen here!

05:47.237 --> 05:50.966
It's a goddamned zombie apocalypse.

05:57.685 --> 05:59.327
Psst!

05:59.505 --> 06:02.373
- Are you alive or undead?
- What?

06:02.443 --> 06:06.000
- Where the hell is everybody?
- I let them go.

06:06.302 --> 06:08.224
You what?

06:08.365 --> 06:10.177
It's the first Christmas without Dad.

06:10.263 --> 06:13.177
He always gave the staff the
holiday off, so I did, too.

06:13.209 --> 06:14.701
- You can't do that.
- Why?

06:14.763 --> 06:17.529
Because we have no idea
how to fend for ourselves.

06:17.554 --> 06:19.576
We did fine every other year.

06:19.607 --> 06:21.549
- Ow!
- He let the staff go

06:21.551 --> 06:22.740
after months of planning.

06:22.779 --> 06:25.170
Every detail
was planned in advance.

06:25.195 --> 06:26.888
- What are we going to eat?
- Mum.

06:26.951 --> 06:29.295
Do you know how easy it is
to fix a Turkey these days?

06:29.357 --> 06:32.427
You just season it and wait
for that thing to pop up.

06:32.490 --> 06:35.146
You think turkeys are born
with those pop-up things?

06:35.193 --> 06:38.287
- It'll be fine.
- What the hell are you doing in here?

06:38.368 --> 06:40.435
I thought
I'd set the table with len,

06:40.537 --> 06:43.704
- start a new family tradition.
- And?

06:43.771 --> 06:46.123
- Do you know where the stuff is?
- The stuff.

06:46.170 --> 06:48.959
- You mean like plates? Silverware?

06:49.037 --> 06:51.068
Or are we going to eat
the pop-up Turkey

06:51.131 --> 06:53.447
with our hands this year?

06:53.959 --> 06:56.552
I just wanted to feel
like Dad was with us.

06:58.146 --> 07:02.552
- I'm sorry.
- I wonder if nobu is open.

07:04.177 --> 07:06.302
Are you alive or undead?

07:06.334 --> 07:10.427
It's fine. Fine? It's a
goddamned zombie apocalypse.

07:10.443 --> 07:13.896
- Liam gave the staff the day off.
- Why?

07:13.943 --> 07:16.240
Because that's what
Simon used to do.

07:16.272 --> 07:19.851
- After weeks of preparation.
- Possibly months.

07:19.876 --> 07:23.511
What on earth are we supposed to do now?
Spend Christmas together.

07:23.560 --> 07:26.154
Just us,
and we'll do it ourselves.

07:26.215 --> 07:28.881
- Sounds horrible.
- But not impossible.

07:28.951 --> 07:32.170
- Who's with me?
- Oh, I need a drink.

07:32.221 --> 07:34.756
- Definitely a drink.
- Make it two.

07:34.802 --> 07:36.624
Right.

07:36.670 --> 07:39.627
Come on, let's get started.

07:40.774 --> 07:42.607
Great.

07:44.375 --> 07:47.680
Liam ruins Christmas.

07:47.734 --> 07:51.312
Good thing big brother's
back to clean up your mess.

07:51.562 --> 07:53.473
Again.

08:10.568 --> 08:12.468
Naughty or nice?

08:15.590 --> 08:19.039
- Ooh, both. Hi.
- Hey.

08:19.094 --> 08:20.555
What you got there?

08:20.633 --> 08:22.719
Oh, just presents from people.

08:22.750 --> 08:25.101
Dignitaries and poshy suck-ups.

08:25.133 --> 08:27.633
I don't really know most of them.

08:27.692 --> 08:32.062
Hm. So Robert knows about my...

08:32.094 --> 08:33.763
History.

08:34.799 --> 08:38.534
Oh. I just thought I'd let you
know, in case it came up.

08:38.570 --> 08:41.679
- How did that go?
- He seemed more concerned

08:41.726 --> 08:43.359
that I was using the family gym.

08:43.580 --> 08:45.874
He likes his rules.

08:47.722 --> 08:50.984
Hey. Have I told you...

08:51.271 --> 08:54.961
How happy I am that you're
spending Christmas with me?

08:56.221 --> 08:58.640
Yeah, about that, I um...

08:59.133 --> 09:02.140
I figured I'm just going
to lay low today.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.812
It's important for your
family to spend time together

09:04.871 --> 09:08.073
considering it's the first
Christmas without your father.

09:08.562 --> 09:11.351
Oh, okay. Are you sure?
Yeah.

09:11.536 --> 09:13.937
Yeah, I think
it's for the best and...

09:14.180 --> 09:17.883
I'm gonna find you
at the end of the night.

09:18.305 --> 09:19.836
You'd better,

09:19.930 --> 09:21.797
because you have to
unwrap your present.

09:21.911 --> 09:25.008
And by present, I mean... me.

09:25.178 --> 09:26.977
Mm.

09:33.495 --> 09:35.595
Hmm.

09:38.328 --> 09:42.065
Will your family miss you
at all? I know I will.

09:42.234 --> 09:43.867
No.

09:44.203 --> 09:46.880
They won't miss me and
I certainly won't miss them.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.839
- You won't even call them?
- No.

09:50.781 --> 09:53.007
I'd give anything to hear
my father's voice.

09:53.109 --> 09:54.182
Yeah.

09:54.207 --> 09:57.742
But... your father didn't
dress you up as an elf

09:57.776 --> 10:01.453
and make you ring a bell to
steal Salvation Army Money.

10:03.763 --> 10:05.963
He's still your father.

10:07.158 --> 10:10.125
And I bet you were
the cutest little elf.

10:16.726 --> 10:19.625
- Code red.
- For Santa claus?

10:19.663 --> 10:21.898
No, code red for disaster.

10:22.140 --> 10:24.118
The necklace we picked out
for Eleanor was a bad idea.

10:24.142 --> 10:26.809
- She has so much jewelry already.
- Of course she does.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.562
- She's a Princess.
- Alright.

10:28.605 --> 10:30.953
So why didn't stripey pants
the elf tell me that

10:30.989 --> 10:34.187
- when we picked it out?
- You never asked me.

10:40.058 --> 10:43.600
Why don't you just make her
something else instead?

10:43.625 --> 10:45.695
- Like what?
- A story book.

10:45.730 --> 10:48.865
All princesses
have stories about them.

10:50.368 --> 10:52.219
That's actually not bad.
Tell me more.

10:52.244 --> 10:54.109
But whatever you say next
is my idea.

10:54.158 --> 10:56.993
We could make up a story
and draw the pictures

10:57.074 --> 10:59.974
and at the end you can put your
present in it so it's like

10:59.999 --> 11:01.547
a Happily Ever After necklace.

11:01.609 --> 11:04.156
I bet she doesn't have
one of those yet.

11:04.328 --> 11:06.426
Or you could draw her face

11:06.476 --> 11:08.281
and give her
a beard with macaroni.

11:08.359 --> 11:10.386
No, I like the first idea.

11:11.056 --> 11:13.323
- You're a genius.
- I know.

11:26.638 --> 11:29.164
You're not actually thinking
about cooking that thing?

11:29.223 --> 11:32.913
Mr. Hoenigsberg, what brings
you round on Christmas Eve?

11:32.947 --> 11:35.156
The King's Midnight Christmas Address.

11:35.274 --> 11:37.158
I just wanted to make sure
everything's in order.

11:37.182 --> 11:40.252
Order doesn't seem to be in great
supply here today.

11:40.369 --> 11:41.736
 Yeah, I heard.

11:41.799 --> 11:44.305
- What can I help you with?
- You underestimate me.

11:44.421 --> 11:48.937
I'm the Queen. What makes you think I can't
whip up a magnificent figgy pudding?

11:48.994 --> 11:53.133
You do realize figgy pudding
is prepared a year in advance?

11:53.250 --> 11:55.564
No, I didn't realize that.

11:55.657 --> 11:59.282
The good news is there's bound to
be a figgy pudding hiding somewhere

11:59.337 --> 12:02.978
and the better news is I do
make a very succulent Turkey.

12:03.041 --> 12:05.782
Then, unfortunately,

12:05.837 --> 12:09.431
it seems we simply can't
manage without you.

12:09.948 --> 12:11.748
Cheers.

12:17.397 --> 12:20.025
That's... a lot of stuff.

12:22.727 --> 12:26.062
Maybe there's a picture
of our table online.

12:27.232 --> 12:28.829
What part of this family

12:28.897 --> 12:32.071
made you think that
we could manage on our own?

12:32.290 --> 12:35.238
No part whatsoever.

12:35.618 --> 12:38.374
Dad would've done
the same thing.

12:41.040 --> 12:44.329
I got Jasper
the best Christmas gift.

12:44.478 --> 12:47.250
An original letter
from Catherine of Valois

12:47.299 --> 12:48.704
to Owen tudor.

12:48.917 --> 12:52.189
Can you believe that? One of
their original love letters.

12:52.657 --> 12:55.124
God, I cannot wait
to give it to him.

12:55.384 --> 12:58.972
I'm glad you're happy. Well,
I'm un-glad that you're not.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.564
What's going on?

13:09.642 --> 13:11.009
I met a girl.

13:11.079 --> 13:12.931
Hm... it's always a girl.

13:12.970 --> 13:16.978
She was seeing someone, then stopped seeing
him, and now she's seeing him again.

13:17.048 --> 13:19.595
- Bitch sounds bootless.
- She's not.

13:19.642 --> 13:23.023
So, she was seeing someone,
then she's seeing you,

13:23.048 --> 13:26.142
and now she's seeing him again?

13:26.179 --> 13:28.346
She thought he was dead.

13:29.260 --> 13:31.118
So did I.

13:31.162 --> 13:35.198
You're dating Robby's ex?
I was.

13:35.236 --> 13:38.361
Before you think less of
her, she is extraordinary.

13:38.415 --> 13:40.517
- She sounds like it!
- She's incredibly giving.

13:40.565 --> 13:41.915
Giving it to both my brothers.

13:41.940 --> 13:43.606
Len.

13:44.642 --> 13:47.782
She lost him, too.
Just like we did.

13:49.275 --> 13:51.478
She went through that darkness.

13:51.534 --> 13:53.534
Just like we did.

13:53.935 --> 13:55.736
When Robert came back,
we ended it.

13:55.775 --> 14:01.935
He doesn't know about it, there's
no reason he should. Please...

14:01.960 --> 14:04.439
If you haven't got me
anything for Christmas yet,

14:04.496 --> 14:07.056
I'm going to need
a lot more weed.

14:10.095 --> 14:13.069
I'm thankful every day
that Robert's home, but...

14:15.996 --> 14:18.063
I was happy, you know?

14:18.827 --> 14:20.727
Yeah.

14:25.483 --> 14:28.532
Maybe paper plates
in the red state room?

14:28.620 --> 14:30.419
Works for me.

14:40.251 --> 14:43.368
Alright, we got glue, glitter,

14:43.431 --> 14:44.834
whatever these things are.

14:44.836 --> 14:46.650
We need that artwork now.

14:50.405 --> 14:52.673
Okay, here you go.

14:54.879 --> 14:56.913
The story is about
Alice in the Palace

14:56.939 --> 14:58.509
and her caterpillar friend,
Frosty.

14:58.556 --> 15:02.376
Frosty the Caterpillar? He's
a wonderful caterpillar.

15:02.423 --> 15:06.032
He wants to change into a butterfly
so the Princess will notice him.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.134
Why? What's wrong
with being a caterpillar?

15:08.173 --> 15:10.126
That's what he finds out
along the way.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.431
And the Princess
loves him, anyway.

15:13.307 --> 15:15.400
Okay, so that's the Princess?

15:15.435 --> 15:16.743
- Yeah.
- And that's me?

15:16.768 --> 15:18.734
Uh-huh.

15:18.868 --> 15:21.243
Why's my head so big
and my legs so short?

15:21.306 --> 15:24.571
My Daddy's legs are short
and he looks pretty good.

15:27.486 --> 15:29.712
I've got three eyes in this one.

15:29.737 --> 15:33.282
- That's your nose.
- Does the caterpillar have scoliosis?

15:33.321 --> 15:36.462
I don't even know what that is.

15:36.554 --> 15:38.189
And how come Alice
is in the palace?

15:38.214 --> 15:41.556
I thought it's supposed to be a story
about Frosty and the Princess.

15:41.659 --> 15:44.407
It is. But I've always
wanted to be in a Fairy Tale.

15:44.479 --> 15:45.986
Is that okay?

15:48.165 --> 15:50.266
Couldn't tell the story
without you.

15:52.837 --> 15:55.650
I look like a
cockroach in this one.

16:12.190 --> 16:13.856
Spencer?

16:14.306 --> 16:16.759
- It's bound to be around here somewhere.
- What is?

16:16.822 --> 16:17.970
The figgy pudding.

16:17.998 --> 16:21.650
The palace chef would have prepared
it and placed it somewhere cool.

16:22.415 --> 16:26.001
I woke up in a poor mood
today. You've made it better.

16:26.099 --> 16:28.733
You always make my day
better, Your Majesty.

16:29.799 --> 16:32.199
Do you want to have sex?

16:33.635 --> 16:37.304
When posed by you, the answer
to that question is always yes.

16:43.001 --> 16:45.165
This is so much better than
Christmas at home.

16:45.189 --> 16:47.189
 Shut up.

16:47.610 --> 16:49.243
You shut up.

16:49.328 --> 16:53.415
Shut your sexy damn regal mouth.

16:53.775 --> 16:55.808
- Oh!
- Oh, shit!

16:55.861 --> 16:57.733
- Are you okay?
- It's fine, don't stop.

16:57.759 --> 16:59.079
No, let me see.

16:59.196 --> 17:02.505
Under penalty of treason,
don't you dare stop.

17:02.564 --> 17:04.445
Yes, ma'am.

17:04.742 --> 17:07.915
Oh. Look, we found
the figgy pudding.

17:17.252 --> 17:20.502
- How does it look?
- Amazing! What do you think?

17:20.673 --> 17:23.078
Looks damned delicious
from here.

17:23.103 --> 17:24.759
Is that right?

17:24.798 --> 17:26.734
- Oh, my god.
- What?

17:26.760 --> 17:29.182
You've got a black eye.

17:29.379 --> 17:30.911
What?

17:32.462 --> 17:34.250
Oh! Good lord!

17:34.275 --> 17:37.212
Thank goodness I'm not giving
the Christmas address tonight.

17:39.853 --> 17:41.759
You should take it easy,
dear uncle.

17:41.796 --> 17:44.485
You have a speech to make.
You feign concern.

17:44.525 --> 17:46.299
I'm lucky you haven't
roofied my drinks

17:46.301 --> 17:49.040
so you can swoop in
and make a bid for the crown.

17:49.298 --> 17:53.400
Not my style. I plan to wage
a fair and decent campaign.

17:54.009 --> 17:56.282
Saying that, I did get you
a little something.

17:56.307 --> 17:59.178
You should probably open it
before we join the others.

17:59.235 --> 18:00.847
Hm.

18:06.946 --> 18:10.907
Wine. A little boring.
I hope you kept the receipt.

18:10.978 --> 18:13.087
I'm afraid it can't be returned.

18:13.157 --> 18:17.032
You see, this wine bears
an inscription on its back.

18:17.071 --> 18:20.728
"Drink with me
and we shall never thirst."

18:21.876 --> 18:25.103
It seems all the candidates
for the Privy Council,

18:25.142 --> 18:27.006
the very committee
that will decide

18:27.031 --> 18:28.696
which one of us
shall next be king,

18:28.728 --> 18:31.392
received this very gift
from the king himself.

18:31.439 --> 18:36.087
It's Christmas, Robert.
'Tis the season to give.

18:36.868 --> 18:38.579
Be careful, uncle.

18:38.657 --> 18:42.517
I'd be wary about alienating
the new guard with old tricks.

18:42.556 --> 18:44.290
It could work against you.

18:45.159 --> 18:48.571
I like you, Robert.
I always have.

18:48.596 --> 18:53.064
But you'd be unwise to play
a game of chess with me.

18:55.770 --> 18:59.603
Remember that. I played
chess with my father.

19:00.247 --> 19:02.657
You'd be wise to remember that.

19:10.752 --> 19:13.185
(Christmas music in background)

19:25.739 --> 19:28.776
So, you want to tell me what the
text is about or do I guess?

19:28.815 --> 19:30.932
I'm a journalist, Mr. Frost.

19:30.972 --> 19:34.292
I'm working on a story
about HRH Princess Eleanor

19:34.342 --> 19:37.128
and the relationship she's
having with her bodyguard.

19:37.178 --> 19:39.557
Care to comment?
You think writing a story

19:39.596 --> 19:41.854
about the Princess in a
relationship is ground-breaking?

19:41.901 --> 19:43.167
Good luck with that.

19:43.213 --> 19:46.784
I think it's ground-breaking if her
bodyguard is secretly American,

19:46.893 --> 19:49.204
tried to steal
the Koh-i-Noor

19:49.229 --> 19:53.225
and comes from a long line
of thieves and liars.

19:56.083 --> 19:59.753
Sit down, handsome.
Have a drink, it's Christmas.

20:01.542 --> 20:03.464
Besides, you never know...

20:03.504 --> 20:05.538
There may be a way out of this.

20:16.010 --> 20:18.971
I found our board game.
Crowned!

20:19.020 --> 20:21.596
Nobody wants to play
that damned thing.

20:21.628 --> 20:25.018
You just hate it because your piece
looks like Margaret Thatcher.

20:27.128 --> 20:30.029
- Dad loved this game.
- Only because he always won.

20:30.331 --> 20:33.253
Here's Mum...

20:34.284 --> 20:35.948
Dad...

20:36.018 --> 20:37.770
Margaret Thatcher,

20:37.967 --> 20:39.266
Robby...

20:39.741 --> 20:42.089
Me...

20:42.135 --> 20:44.237
Oh, Liam, your piece is missing.

20:44.312 --> 20:48.096
I'm surprised they even bothered
to make one. Too insignificant.

20:49.299 --> 20:52.792
We could play Simon says instead.
Good idea!

20:52.846 --> 20:56.378
Simon says, "I got killed
by Ted pryce."

20:56.432 --> 20:59.325
Lose a turn.

21:00.065 --> 21:02.228
Why would you say
something like that?

21:02.307 --> 21:06.232
Is the missing piece going to strike
a cancer victim on Christmas?

21:06.524 --> 21:07.846
Very possibly.

21:07.888 --> 21:11.417
Come on, uncle. Perhaps a refresher
course in Christmas etiquette.

21:11.534 --> 21:15.823
And perhaps a refresher
course, Liam, in mattering,

21:15.893 --> 21:18.073
# Yesterdaysnews.

21:18.146 --> 21:19.945
Come on, uncle.

21:23.711 --> 21:25.645
So, Harper...

21:26.221 --> 21:28.187
Is that your real name?

21:28.284 --> 21:29.732
Possibly.

21:30.159 --> 21:33.659
Alright, well, possibly, Harper,

21:34.432 --> 21:37.745
I'm going to give you the
opportunity to walk away right now.

21:38.870 --> 21:40.253
Or?

21:40.371 --> 21:42.784
Or the alternative isn't very Christmassy.

21:45.783 --> 21:48.302
Well, Mr. Frost...

21:49.077 --> 21:52.862
I have you, I have the Princess

21:52.901 --> 21:56.010
and I have a gentleman who's
more than happy to fill in

21:56.084 --> 21:59.785
all the delicious, sordid blanks.

22:01.899 --> 22:04.166
Fine.

22:05.287 --> 22:07.542
So let's say...

22:08.963 --> 22:11.864
This story that you have
about me is true.

22:12.393 --> 22:16.081
Leave her out of it. Come after me.

22:16.268 --> 22:19.128
She's in such
a good place right now...

22:20.721 --> 22:24.448
And you dragging her down for your
selfish gains, well, it's just...

22:24.645 --> 22:26.312
Tragic.

22:28.282 --> 22:30.424
My story is true.

22:31.026 --> 22:33.628
You are in a relationship.

22:33.901 --> 22:36.214
So let's make one thing clear.

22:36.596 --> 22:40.010
You are the one
bringing her down, not me.

22:49.900 --> 22:51.846
It's snowing!

22:53.479 --> 22:54.923
I installed a snow machine.

22:54.948 --> 22:58.043
Luckily, Liam didn't cancel it.

22:58.706 --> 23:02.081
I haven't spent many
Christmases in the palace.

23:02.542 --> 23:07.409
Over the years, I would use the
holiday as an excuse to go home.

23:07.447 --> 23:10.759
At least, that was
the official version.

23:11.807 --> 23:14.792
Unofficially, I would
spend Christmas night

23:14.878 --> 23:17.307
with the man I loved.

23:17.350 --> 23:19.717
Not Simon.

23:22.049 --> 23:25.105
I'm telling you this
to put my earlier behavior

23:25.107 --> 23:26.385
into context.

23:26.410 --> 23:28.026
You don't owe me that.

23:28.057 --> 23:31.245
I'm here for whatever
your majesty needs.

23:31.424 --> 23:33.146
Any version.

23:34.042 --> 23:36.581
There's a red button
on the desk in the library.

23:36.606 --> 23:40.292
The King presses it and the
Christmas Address goes live.

23:41.156 --> 23:46.729
I'll leave your majesty to enjoy the
rest of the holiday with your family.

23:46.792 --> 23:48.828
Spencer, thank you.

24:01.109 --> 24:04.182
Robert knows about Jasper.
About him and Mum?

24:04.237 --> 24:06.672
- No.
- About him and Mandy?

24:06.815 --> 24:08.448
No!

24:08.473 --> 24:10.917
About him blackmailing...

24:10.918 --> 24:14.364
- No! About his past before he got here.
- Oh, right.

24:14.389 --> 24:17.128
Why does it matter
if Robert approves of him?

24:17.167 --> 24:21.261
- You didn't care what I thought.
- About what?

24:21.292 --> 24:24.152
I was going to tell you about Jasper,
but you were just back from the dead

24:24.176 --> 24:26.768
and it just didn't seem
like the right time.

24:26.835 --> 24:29.335
It's a tangled web we weave, Lenny.

24:31.104 --> 24:34.674
- He said he saw you.
- Yeah, this morning in the family gym.

24:34.676 --> 24:37.924
- What's that supposed to mean?
- That I saw him in the gym.

24:37.995 --> 24:40.440
- You said "family" gym.
- You did say that.

24:40.514 --> 24:42.487
Fine. Family gym.

24:42.551 --> 24:45.315
So he's in the family gym
and he's seeing Eleanor,

24:45.401 --> 24:47.518
neither of which has anything
to do with you. Liam.

24:47.565 --> 24:50.839
If you've a problem
with Jasper, just say it.

24:51.003 --> 24:52.737
Right now,
I have a problem with you.

24:52.784 --> 24:55.010
You screwed up, let the staff go.

24:55.057 --> 24:57.565
I rally the family, like always.

24:57.628 --> 25:00.612
- Just say thank you, sparrow.
- Don't call me that.

25:00.760 --> 25:04.009
If you have an issue with
your code name, call MI6.

25:04.034 --> 25:06.572
Don't make it seem like I've
gone out of my way to remind you

25:06.574 --> 25:08.942
that you're not the firstborn
son of this family...

25:09.377 --> 25:11.878
- Sparrow.
- I said...

25:15.128 --> 25:16.964
Don't call me that.

25:17.260 --> 25:20.417
- What's going on?
- Wow! What happened to your eye?

25:20.487 --> 25:23.956
Oh, that. I was attacked
by a figgy pudding

25:23.981 --> 25:26.409
whilst having spontaneous
sexual intercourse.

25:26.565 --> 25:28.104
What?!

25:28.208 --> 25:31.110
Ho, ho, ho!

25:31.229 --> 25:33.260
Cyrus, you need to sleep it off.

25:33.346 --> 25:36.792
I don't need to do dick, Muhammad Ali.

25:36.837 --> 25:40.128
- You're ruining Christmas.
- Liam already did that.

25:40.190 --> 25:42.342
Ho, ho, ho!

25:42.344 --> 25:44.377
Ho... holy shit!

25:47.190 --> 25:49.745
And to all a good night.

25:58.960 --> 26:01.027
- Hey.
- Hi.

26:04.377 --> 26:06.411
I missed you.

26:07.962 --> 26:10.161
Do you want to exchange
presents now?

26:10.281 --> 26:13.370
I've been dying to give you your gift.
I think you'll really love it.

26:13.436 --> 26:15.237
I didn't get you anything.

26:15.426 --> 26:19.729
Oh, that's okay.
Having you close is enough.

26:20.510 --> 26:21.995
This is for you.

26:22.146 --> 26:25.643
- I don't feel comfortable accepting that.
- What?

26:25.799 --> 26:29.788
I said I didn't get you anything.
It's okay, it's Christmas.

26:30.955 --> 26:35.260
I'm just feeling,
um... suffocated.

26:36.744 --> 26:39.963
What with the gifts and the letters,
and you saying you missed me.

26:40.362 --> 26:43.674
- I did... I did miss you.
- Well, I didn't ask you to.

26:46.208 --> 26:49.842
What's going on?
Did... did something happen?

26:49.948 --> 26:52.698
It was the letter I wrote,
wasn't it?

26:52.776 --> 26:55.088
I want to stop that, too.

26:55.183 --> 26:57.440
Why?

26:57.932 --> 27:00.533
Because I can't be the guy
waiting around for letters

27:00.658 --> 27:03.456
or writing words that I don't mean.

27:04.948 --> 27:06.783
- Don't say that.
- I don't.

27:06.860 --> 27:09.315
The sex is one thing, but I'm
no good at relationships.

27:09.385 --> 27:12.252
- And I can't be in one, not with you.
- Everything was so good.

27:12.299 --> 27:15.729
- Everything was so good for you.
- And it wasn't for you?

27:15.804 --> 27:18.135
I'm just trying to be honest.

27:20.799 --> 27:24.277
- I'm sorry.
- It was that letter, wasn't it?

27:24.315 --> 27:26.179
It was everything.

27:32.104 --> 27:33.737
Okay.

27:39.494 --> 27:43.487
- I've given you so many chances.
- Well, you shouldn't have.

27:48.536 --> 27:50.385
I'm not worth it.

28:15.151 --> 28:17.209
You did a good job
on the Turkey, mum.

28:17.311 --> 28:19.639
Actually, I ruined the Turkey.

28:19.702 --> 28:21.662
- Who made this?
- I did.

28:21.811 --> 28:24.154
And the stuffing
and the bread sauce.

28:24.201 --> 28:25.679
And the pink charlene.

28:25.725 --> 28:27.107
The pink charlene is divine.

28:27.131 --> 28:28.497
Yeah.

28:30.419 --> 28:33.120
- Eleanor, are you okay?
- No.

28:38.227 --> 28:41.139
It's been a long
and unexpected day,

28:41.170 --> 28:43.201
but in the absence of Dad,

28:43.248 --> 28:44.775
I suppose it's incumbent upon me

28:44.800 --> 28:47.170
to remind everyone
how fortunate we are

28:47.201 --> 28:50.171
for the food and
for everyone's company.

28:50.773 --> 28:52.389
When I was stranded
on that island

28:52.422 --> 28:55.223
I would have given anything
for this moment with you.

28:56.412 --> 28:58.679
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.982
- I wasn't on an island...
- Liam.

29:05.045 --> 29:08.521
And I'm not sure
it's incumbent upon anyone

29:08.600 --> 29:11.693
to remind us of anything
in the absence of our father.

29:11.764 --> 29:14.623
Regardless,
here's to a Happy Christmas

29:14.664 --> 29:16.490
and to ushering in a new year

29:16.545 --> 29:19.240
where hopefully everyone's
a little less full of shit

29:19.311 --> 29:22.193
than they are this year,
especially my brother.

29:25.141 --> 29:27.748
Here's to Liam for
being disgraceful today.

29:27.795 --> 29:31.045
- To Robert blowing me.
- Enough!

29:33.837 --> 29:35.051
Would you pass the...

29:35.076 --> 29:37.795
- Who's giving the address tonight?
- I am.

29:37.820 --> 29:40.120
- The hell you are.
- Look who I found.

29:40.122 --> 29:42.890
I'm the king,
I'll give the speech.

29:42.915 --> 29:44.936
Robert is giving
the Christmas Address.

29:44.994 --> 29:46.248
If he does,

29:46.303 --> 29:49.373
I'm going to moon
the entire United Kingdom

29:49.432 --> 29:51.565
on live television.

29:51.607 --> 29:55.342
They might even get a
glimpse of my jingle bells.

29:55.514 --> 29:57.014
Bell.

29:57.084 --> 30:00.541
- What's "moon" mean?
- Robert is not giving my address.

30:00.592 --> 30:02.451
Cyrus!
I'll give it.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.020
I don't think
that's a good idea.

30:04.045 --> 30:05.042
Why not?

30:05.067 --> 30:08.045
Well, A: You assaulted Beck
on our balcony appearance

30:08.154 --> 30:11.333
and B: you've pretty much
been an arsehole all day.

30:11.411 --> 30:12.880
Robert is giving it.

30:12.916 --> 30:15.614
- Full moon this Christmas.
- Shut up!

30:15.927 --> 30:19.700
Everyone, shut up
about the stupid speech.

30:19.962 --> 30:22.829
Just cancel it. Do you think
that Christmas won't come

30:22.854 --> 30:25.721
if we cancel the stupid speech?

30:26.511 --> 30:28.903
God.

30:29.071 --> 30:31.115
Look at us.

30:31.153 --> 30:35.255
Your father would be aghast
if he could see us.

30:35.678 --> 30:38.903
Well, you better fix it -
we better fix it.

30:38.989 --> 30:40.513
What's it going to take?

30:40.653 --> 30:43.717
Does anyone know
what would fix this mess?

30:43.719 --> 30:45.753
Ooh!

30:47.235 --> 30:49.501
- Yes, Sara Alice?
- Presents.

30:49.942 --> 30:52.927
We don't give presents
in this family, sweetheart.

30:53.091 --> 30:56.224
What about the secret presents,
the ones from Santa claus?

30:56.388 --> 30:58.999
There is no Santa claus.

31:00.331 --> 31:04.066
- Other than me, I mean.
- Of course there's a Santa claus.

31:04.240 --> 31:07.731
He already left you some
presents. I'll show you.

31:29.665 --> 31:31.865
What have you got?

31:32.675 --> 31:35.009
Is it from Santa?

31:42.181 --> 31:44.348
No.

31:46.943 --> 31:49.044
They're from Dad.

that the right thing to do
is to walk away from this.
