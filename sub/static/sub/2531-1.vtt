04:06.455 --> 04:09.624
My mommy always said
there were no monsters.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.709
No real ones.

04:13.837 --> 04:16.923
But there are.

04:17.007 --> 04:19.675
We've seen
no additional defects.

04:22.346 --> 04:26.182
She's perfect.
Mm-hmm.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.960
Careful.

04:55.045 --> 04:57.588
Two centimeters.

04:57.673 --> 05:02.301
Okay.

05:02.386 --> 05:04.303
Yeah.

05:04.388 --> 05:06.389
Ready with that amnio.

05:10.727 --> 05:13.479
Oh.
And...

05:18.151 --> 05:20.069
there it is.

05:24.616 --> 05:25.991
No.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.627
Be careful.

05:43.802 --> 05:45.219
Jesus.

05:48.724 --> 05:50.057
Clamp.

05:51.601 --> 05:56.230
What about her?
Can we keep her alive?

05:56.314 --> 05:58.232
How's the host?

05:58.316 --> 06:00.943
Doing well.

06:05.282 --> 06:07.575
Sew her back up.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.497
Excellent work, everybody.

07:55.934 --> 07:57.852
And how is
our Number 8 today?

07:57.936 --> 08:00.437
Appears to be
in good health.

08:00.522 --> 08:03.566
Hmm?
How good?
Excellent,

08:03.650 --> 08:07.528
as in completely off
our projected charts.

08:08.572 --> 08:10.573
Look at the scar tissue.

08:13.952 --> 08:17.246
See the recession?
This is from three days ago?

08:17.330 --> 08:21.000
Exactly.
Oh, this is good.

08:21.084 --> 08:23.085
This is very good.

08:25.088 --> 08:28.340
You're gonna make us all
very proud.

08:43.899 --> 08:46.025
No.

08:46.109 --> 08:48.027
Don't. I'm all right.

08:49.404 --> 08:51.280
Now try this.

08:58.622 --> 09:01.498
- Hand.
- Close.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.584
Glove.

09:12.594 --> 09:15.554
Number 8?

09:15.639 --> 09:17.514
Fruit.

09:17.641 --> 09:20.726
Good. Cherries.
It's unprecedented.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.062
Totally.
She's operating...

09:23.146 --> 09:26.982
at a completely adult capacity.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.612
What about her memories?
There are gaps.

09:31.696 --> 09:34.907
And some degree
of synaptic dissonance.
- You know this.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.909
She's freaked.
Come on.

09:36.993 --> 09:38.619
It has connective difficulties,

09:38.703 --> 09:41.872
caused by a biochemical imbalance,
causing emotional autism.

09:41.998 --> 09:43.540
Certain reactions—
All right,
wait a second!

09:43.625 --> 09:47.753
It has memories.
Why does it have memories?

09:47.837 --> 09:50.130
Well, I'm guessing, but...
inherited memories,

09:50.215 --> 09:53.050
passed down generationally
at a genetic level...

09:53.134 --> 09:55.886
by the aliens, like its strength.

09:55.971 --> 10:00.140
Plus a, uh,
highly evolved form of instinct.

10:00.225 --> 10:03.602
An unexpected benefit
from the genetic crossing.

10:03.687 --> 10:06.146
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.
I see.

10:06.231 --> 10:08.774
Stupid me.
Of course.

10:08.858 --> 10:11.944
An unexpected benefit
of the genetic process.

10:12.028 --> 10:14.196
Oh! And I didn't
even think of that!

10:15.699 --> 10:18.075
Let's try this one.

10:21.997 --> 10:23.914
Ripley?

10:25.000 --> 10:27.001
Ripley.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.587
Ripley, what is it?

10:33.591 --> 10:35.718
Ripley? Ripley?

10:40.598 --> 10:42.516
You're not thinking
termination?

10:42.600 --> 10:44.518
Oh, boy,
am I thinking termination.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.520
General,
we do not perceive this
to be a problem.

10:46.604 --> 10:49.315
Ellen Ripley died trying to
wipe this species out.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.734
For all intents and purposes,
she succeeded.

10:51.818 --> 10:54.236
I'm not anxious to see her
taking up her old hobbies.

10:54.362 --> 10:56.822
That won't happen.
We won't tell her.

10:56.906 --> 11:00.075
Oh, I see.
And that's supposed
to comfort me?

11:01.494 --> 11:04.204
Identification, please.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.252
Please try again.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.671
Thank you, General Perez.

11:12.756 --> 11:16.008
Bottom line is,
she looks at me funny
one time,

11:16.092 --> 11:18.010
I'm putting her down.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.387
Okay, as far as I'm concerned,
Number 8...

11:20.472 --> 11:24.183
is a meat... by-product.

11:27.270 --> 11:30.189
Her Majesty here
is the real payoff.

11:30.273 --> 11:32.566
When does she start producing?
Days.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.610
Less maybe.

11:35.612 --> 11:39.114
We need the cargo.
I told you,
it's on its way.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.321
Fork.

12:20.323 --> 12:23.826
- Fuck.
- It's-It's "fork."

12:27.247 --> 12:30.040
How did you—

12:31.334 --> 12:33.794
How did... we get you?

12:33.878 --> 12:36.380
Yes.

12:39.634 --> 12:43.429
Hard work.
We used blood samples...

12:43.513 --> 12:45.556
from Fiori Sixteen on ice,

12:45.640 --> 12:47.933
where you died.

12:48.017 --> 12:51.103
We've remade you.
We cloned you.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.189
Fiori Sixteen.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.861
Does that ring a bell?

12:58.945 --> 13:01.572
Are you remembering something?

13:03.199 --> 13:06.076
- Does it grow?
- Yeah.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.037
Very rapidly.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.915
It's a queen.

13:13.835 --> 13:16.170
How did you know that?

13:16.254 --> 13:19.673
She'll breed.
You'll die.

13:20.758 --> 13:23.343
Everyone in the company
will die.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.345
In the— In the-
In the company?

13:25.430 --> 13:29.725
Weyland-Yutani.
Ripley 8's
former employers.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.978
Terran growth conglomerate.
They had...

13:33.062 --> 13:35.314
defense contracts
under the military.

13:35.398 --> 13:38.859
Oh, they went under
decades ago, Gediman.
Way before your time.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.903
Bought out by Wal-Mart.

13:42.864 --> 13:45.115
Fortunes of war.

13:45.241 --> 13:48.535
I think you will find
that, uh,

13:49.579 --> 13:52.080
things have changed
a great deal since your time.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.500
I doubt that.

13:54.584 --> 13:56.502
We're not flying
blind here, you know.

13:56.586 --> 14:00.589
It's United Systems Military,
not some greedy corporation.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.257
Oh.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.092
Well, it won't
make any difference.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.639
You're still gonna die.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.768
How do you feel about that?

14:18.024 --> 14:20.359
I wish you could understand
what we're trying to do here.

14:20.443 --> 14:24.196
The potential for this species
goes way beyond
urban pacification.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.532
New alloys, new vaccines.

14:26.616 --> 14:29.326
Nothing like this we've ever seen
on any world before.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.870
You should be very proud.

14:31.955 --> 14:33.872
Oh.

14:33.957 --> 14:35.582
I am.

14:35.667 --> 14:38.418
And the animal itself-

14:38.503 --> 14:40.712
wondrous.

14:40.797 --> 14:44.883
The potential, unbelievable,
once we've tamed them.

14:46.970 --> 14:49.513
Roll over. Play dead.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.390
Heel?
Mm-hmm.

14:51.474 --> 14:54.059
You can't teach it tricks.

14:54.143 --> 14:58.146
Why not?
We're teaching you.

15:14.289 --> 15:17.833
Hey, son, I'll give you
my authorization code.

15:17.917 --> 15:21.336
It's E-A-T-M-E.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.672
I'm sorry, sir.
Could you repeat that?

15:23.756 --> 15:25.674
Little prick.

15:25.758 --> 15:26.967
You know,

15:28.011 --> 15:29.970
no matter how many times
you see it,

15:30.054 --> 15:34.474
the sight of a woman
all strapped up
in a chair like that just—

15:35.518 --> 15:38.604
What?

15:38.688 --> 15:40.939
Just bring us in on
a 3-0 descent, would ya?

15:41.065 --> 15:44.109
And ride the parallel.
Darlin', it is done.

15:44.193 --> 15:46.445
Good girl.

15:46.529 --> 15:49.781
You, uh, want
anything there, trigger?

15:49.866 --> 15:52.951
Hmm. Yeah.
How 'bout a cup of coffee?

15:53.036 --> 15:55.412
Anything else,
while your mouth's warm,
I mean?

15:55.538 --> 15:58.373
Little milk.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.128
Hey, don't cut thrust
till about 600 meters,

16:03.212 --> 16:05.714
and we'll give 'em
a little scare.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.424
Vriess. Call.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.551
Lock down.
We're gonna dock.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.286
- Hey, Call?
- Yep?

16:37.914 --> 16:41.083
What has two thumbs,
one eye,

16:42.752 --> 16:44.753
a pink tongue...

16:45.797 --> 16:48.298
and screws like a god?

16:50.009 --> 16:51.593
What?

16:58.976 --> 17:02.479
Two thumbs, one eye,
a pink tongue...

17:02.563 --> 17:06.233
and screws like a god?

17:06.317 --> 17:09.277
What?

17:24.752 --> 17:28.046
Time to enjoy some of
the general's hospitality, Christie.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.591
Great.
Army food.

17:31.676 --> 17:35.554
Yeah. It'll do
till we get the family wagon
up to spec, I reckon.

17:35.680 --> 17:39.349
Yeah.
That is if the natives
are friendly.

17:40.435 --> 17:42.352
How's that?

17:42.437 --> 17:44.062
Good.

17:44.147 --> 17:46.606
We expecting any,
uh, trouble?

17:46.691 --> 17:50.736
Nah. From Perez, I doubt it.
But you never know.
We've been there before.

18:05.710 --> 18:08.670
What is wrong with you?

18:08.755 --> 18:10.756
Just a little target practice.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.176
Vriess isn't complaining.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.721
Goddamn it!

18:18.806 --> 18:20.932
Johner, you son of a bitch!

18:21.017 --> 18:24.186
Come on, man.
You didn't feel a thing.

18:28.733 --> 18:31.443
You are an inbred motherfucker,
you know that?

18:37.408 --> 18:39.493
I'll take the knife
back now.

18:43.206 --> 18:45.415
Whoa.

18:46.334 --> 18:48.251
Call, forget it.

18:49.003 --> 18:52.339
He's been sucking down
too much home brew.

18:54.217 --> 18:55.717
The knife.

18:59.514 --> 19:01.348
Son of a bitch!

19:03.434 --> 19:06.937
Don't push me, little Call.
You hang with us for a while,

19:07.021 --> 19:09.689
you'll find out
I am not the man
with whom to fuck!

19:19.700 --> 19:23.703
It's about time
we start associating
with a better class of people.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.878
I am Father.

20:12.962 --> 20:15.881
Welcome to the U.S.M. Auriga.

20:15.965 --> 20:19.634
Step forward for
contraband and weapons search.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.721
Please report
any infectious diseases...

20:22.805 --> 20:24.681
to the medical officers.

20:24.807 --> 20:28.894
Levels 7 through 12
are off-limits to civilians.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.479
Thank you for your cooperation.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.481
Go.

20:35.651 --> 20:38.820
Get your hands up,
please, sir.
What?

20:38.905 --> 20:41.197
Could you get
your hands up, please?

20:50.166 --> 20:52.959
There are no weapons
allowed on board, sir.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.547
My own recipe.

20:58.633 --> 21:00.800
Way more dangerous.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.933
Nice welcome, Perez.
What the hell is this?

21:08.017 --> 21:11.603
What, are you afraid
the six of us are gonna hijack
your damn ship or what?

21:11.687 --> 21:15.273
Just a minor concern
that one of your
asshole crew members...

21:15.358 --> 21:17.817
is gonna get drunk
and put a bullet
through the hull.

21:17.902 --> 21:20.111
We happen to be
in space, Elgyn.

21:20.196 --> 21:22.697
No shit. How you been?

21:30.957 --> 21:33.458
Wanna check the chair?

21:37.964 --> 21:42.384
Elgyn, these were very,
very hard to come by.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.469
So was our cargo.

21:44.553 --> 21:49.140
- You're, uh, not about to plead
poverty on me, are you, General?
- No.

21:49.225 --> 21:52.310
Just saying very few people
deal in cash nowadays.

21:52.395 --> 21:55.021
Just the ones don't like
to keep business records.

21:55.106 --> 21:57.732
- Yourself, for example.
- Drink, Elgyn?

21:57.817 --> 21:59.734
Constantly.

22:04.198 --> 22:06.992
Now, I'm gonna take
a wild guess here, General,

22:07.076 --> 22:10.704
but I'm thinking whatever
you got going on here,

22:10.788 --> 22:14.582
it, uh, ain't exactly approved
by Congress.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.336
Who's the...

22:18.421 --> 22:21.047
new filly you got
on board, Elgyn?

22:21.132 --> 22:25.468
Call. Little girl
playing pirates.

22:25.594 --> 22:27.762
She makes an impression.

22:27.847 --> 22:31.683
She is severely fuckable,
ain't she?

22:38.607 --> 22:42.318
Mighty handy
with a monkey wrench too,
I might add.

22:42.403 --> 22:46.072
I think Vriess
has got a bit of a light
in his eye for her.

22:46.157 --> 22:49.242
Fine little ass like that'd
make a man walk.
You know what I mean?

22:54.165 --> 22:57.375
Mind you, uh, I think
she's just a tad curious...

22:57.460 --> 23:00.170
about, uh,
this little transaction of ours.

23:00.254 --> 23:02.172
I mean, I can't say as I blame her.

23:02.256 --> 23:04.674
It's awfully cloak-and-dagger stuff.

23:04.759 --> 23:07.302
It's a military operation.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.472
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

23:10.556 --> 23:13.475
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but, uh,

23:13.559 --> 23:15.685
I was under the impression
that, uh,

23:15.770 --> 23:20.273
most army medical labs
don't have to operate
outside of regulated space.

23:20.357 --> 23:23.568
- What do you want, Elgyn?
What can I do for you?
- Me?

23:23.652 --> 23:27.072
- Yeah.
- Oh, two days bed and board.

23:27.156 --> 23:30.200
You know,
Vriess might wanna snag a part
here or there, whatever.

23:30.284 --> 23:32.243
I mean, uh, if it's not imposing.

23:32.328 --> 23:34.204
I don't see any problem.

23:35.206 --> 23:37.123
Couple of conditions
though.
Ah.

23:37.208 --> 23:38.792
Conditions?

23:41.170 --> 23:43.338
Not you...

23:43.422 --> 23:45.340
nor any of your...

23:45.424 --> 23:47.592
formidable crew members...

23:47.676 --> 23:49.552
will go anywhere near...

23:49.637 --> 23:51.930
restricted areas.

23:52.014 --> 23:54.140
Rule number two:

23:55.810 --> 23:57.769
No trouble.

23:57.895 --> 24:00.271
Good behavior.
Good behavior.

24:00.356 --> 24:05.860
- No fights.
- No fights.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.698
Mi casa es su casa.

24:35.391 --> 24:39.519
Please direct cargo
to med lab center, area "G."

24:40.896 --> 24:43.231
Follow the lit path.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.275
Do not deviate.

24:56.662 --> 24:59.205
Cargo status: stable.

24:59.290 --> 25:02.000
Life-forms intact.

25:02.084 --> 25:04.544
Stasis uninterrupted.

25:17.016 --> 25:21.644
Med lab center
is off-limits to civilians.

25:21.729 --> 25:23.688
Thank you.

26:34.259 --> 26:36.761
Oh.
Hey. Chill.

26:36.887 --> 26:40.181
Oh, please.
You know I can't
lay off the tall ones.

26:40.265 --> 26:43.518
How you doin'?
How about a little
one-on-one?

26:43.602 --> 26:45.561
What do you say?

26:51.360 --> 26:53.277
You got some moves
on you, girl.

26:53.362 --> 26:55.279
Oh, man.

27:03.414 --> 27:05.999
Mm-hmm.

27:17.803 --> 27:21.139
Well, now, if you don't
wanna play basketball,
I know some other indoor sports.

27:34.153 --> 27:36.362
Come on, now.
Give me the ball.

27:47.583 --> 27:50.418
Okay, I got a new game.

27:50.502 --> 27:51.836
Tag!

28:06.602 --> 28:09.687
Ripley? Ripley.

28:15.944 --> 28:17.904
You've had enough fun.

28:21.533 --> 28:24.035
What the hell are you?

28:33.545 --> 28:36.547
Something of a predator,
isn't she?

28:36.632 --> 28:40.551
Yes, she continues
to make us all very proud.

29:55.836 --> 29:59.589
We're coming up on just
one minute and 30 seconds left...

29:59.673 --> 30:01.591
to order this one-of-a-kind
collector's item.

30:01.675 --> 30:05.595
Jesus Christ, Johner,
what do you put in this shit,
battery acid?

30:06.638 --> 30:08.639
Just for color.

32:14.933 --> 32:19.478
So, we're a fast learner.

32:19.604 --> 32:22.773
Now here's a fine item.
This is a really
good show, man.

32:22.858 --> 32:25.651
It's from the Gut Cutter's
Celebration Collection,

32:25.736 --> 32:28.696
makers of premier
knives and edge ware.

32:28.780 --> 32:31.615
The knife features
a stainless steel blade,

32:31.700 --> 32:35.036
perfect for any use
in hunting or in the home.

32:35.120 --> 32:39.040
The pro handle
is made from authentic
antique plywood...

32:39.124 --> 32:41.709
and stained in brilliant colors
for an uncanny charm.

32:41.793 --> 32:45.379
Hey, man, that shit
is not easy to come by!

32:45.464 --> 32:47.631
Why don't you take
a walk outside?

32:47.716 --> 32:50.009
...to a cutting edge
that will rip through anything—

32:51.011 --> 32:54.263
Great!

32:54.389 --> 32:56.891
I'm so sorry.
Now I smell like this shit!

32:57.017 --> 32:58.934
If bitches
can't handle this shit,

32:59.019 --> 33:00.936
bitches should stay away
from this shit!

33:01.021 --> 33:03.022
Go to bed. Fucking bitch.

33:27.506 --> 33:29.507
Identification, please.

33:34.304 --> 33:42.395
Please try again.

33:44.689 --> 33:48.526
Thank you, General Perez.

34:23.603 --> 34:25.396
Well?

34:28.190 --> 34:30.109
You gonna kill me,
or what?

34:32.862 --> 34:34.780
There's no point,
is there?

34:34.864 --> 34:37.324
They've taken it
out of you.

34:37.409 --> 34:40.411
Where is it?
Is it on the ship?

34:42.289 --> 34:44.415
You mean my baby.

34:46.376 --> 34:48.668
I don't get it.
If they took it out,

34:48.753 --> 34:51.380
why are they
keeping you alive?

34:51.465 --> 34:55.592
Well, they're curious.
I'm the latest thing.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.312
Look.

35:06.396 --> 35:08.314
I can make it all stop.

35:08.398 --> 35:12.443
The pain, this nightmare.
That's all I can offer you.

35:20.410 --> 35:22.495
What makes you think...

35:22.579 --> 35:24.788
I would let you do that?

35:28.793 --> 35:30.711
Who are you?

35:30.795 --> 35:34.882
Ripley, Ellen,
Lieutenant First Class,

35:34.966 --> 35:37.301
number 36706.

35:40.013 --> 35:42.598
Ellen Ripley died
200 years ago.

35:44.017 --> 35:46.143
You're not her.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.688
I'm not her.

35:56.363 --> 35:58.280
Who am I?

35:58.365 --> 36:02.451
You're a thing, a construct.
They grew you in a fucking lab.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.746
And now they brought it
out of you.

36:05.830 --> 36:08.874
Not all the way out.

36:15.006 --> 36:18.968
I can feel it...
behind my eyes.

36:20.637 --> 36:22.638
I can hear it moving.

36:27.018 --> 36:30.437
You gotta help me stop this thing
before it gets loose.

36:33.817 --> 36:35.734
It's too late.

36:35.819 --> 36:38.279
You can't stop it.

36:38.363 --> 36:40.364
It's inevitable.

36:43.535 --> 36:45.494
Not as long as I'm around.

36:46.746 --> 36:49.039
You'll never get out of here alive.

36:50.083 --> 36:52.710
I don't care.

36:52.794 --> 36:54.712
Really?

36:57.424 --> 37:00.092
I can make it stop.

37:06.057 --> 37:09.310
Go on. Get out of here.

37:09.394 --> 37:11.395
They're looking for you.

37:23.366 --> 37:26.952
I think you're gonna find
that this was very ill-advised.

37:27.078 --> 37:29.622
Where are her friends?
They're in
the mess hall, sir.

37:29.706 --> 37:32.875
Well, you find them, now.
Quietly.

37:32.959 --> 37:34.710
What the hell
is going on here?

37:34.794 --> 37:37.254
Smells like
a double-cross, boss.

37:38.840 --> 37:41.216
Where's the other one?
With the chair?

37:42.260 --> 37:44.261
Don't ever touch me.

37:44.346 --> 37:45.471
Ever.

37:45.555 --> 37:48.015
You wanna tell us what this is?

37:48.141 --> 37:50.142
You wanna tell me
who you're workin' for.
What?

37:50.226 --> 37:53.354
- Wren, they got nothing
to do with this.
- To do with what?

37:53.438 --> 37:56.357
Do you know what
the penalties for
terrorist activity are?

37:56.441 --> 38:00.277
No goddamn terrorists
on my crew. Call, there
something you wanna tell me?

38:00.362 --> 38:04.239
Look. I don't care whether
you knew or not. You brought
a terrorist on board a military vessel.

38:04.324 --> 38:07.660
And as far as I am concerned,
you all die with her!

38:09.204 --> 38:11.580
Do you understand?

38:14.125 --> 38:16.377
Yeah.

38:16.461 --> 38:18.462
I understand.

38:20.590 --> 38:22.091
Christie.

38:26.054 --> 38:27.513
Down!

38:29.641 --> 38:31.016
Freeze!

38:40.110 --> 38:42.444
Stop! Drop your weapons!

38:42.529 --> 38:46.365
And you!
Drop that piece of shit,
or I blow his head off!

38:46.449 --> 38:48.867
- Can't do that, man.
- Drop it now!

38:48.952 --> 38:51.537
- Can't do that.
They're attached to me.
- I'm not fucking with you!

38:51.621 --> 38:54.790
You're all under arrest
for a code eight,
which is concealed weapons,

38:54.874 --> 38:56.959
and a code 12, which is murder!

38:57.085 --> 38:59.002
Release Dr. Wren!
Kiss my ass.

38:59.087 --> 39:01.171
Put down your weapons
and assume the fucking—

39:06.469 --> 39:08.387
Everybody okay?

39:09.597 --> 39:12.766
Real easy, soldier boy.

39:12.892 --> 39:15.352
Security.
Get up!

39:15.437 --> 39:19.022
There is a serious problem
in the mess hall.

39:19.107 --> 39:21.191
You lie to me now,
little girl,

39:23.862 --> 39:26.655
I will cut your throat
and leave you here to die,
you understand me?

39:26.865 --> 39:30.325
This is security, Section 2.
We do not read you.
Hello? Goddamn it! Hello?

39:30.410 --> 39:32.411
We do not copy you.
Please repeat.

39:32.537 --> 39:34.496
Hello?
Please repeat.

41:08.675 --> 41:10.634
Gediman!

41:10.718 --> 41:14.304
He's conducting
illegal experiments.
He is breeding some sort of-

41:14.430 --> 41:18.559
Ice the goddamn mole!
Listen to me!
He is breeding an alien species.

41:18.643 --> 41:20.602
More than dangerous.
If those things get loose,

41:20.687 --> 41:23.355
it's gonna make
the Lacerta plague look like
a fucking square dance!

41:23.481 --> 41:26.859
Shut up!

41:26.943 --> 41:28.819
Listen.

41:28.945 --> 41:32.406
Your attention, please.

41:32.490 --> 41:36.326
Security breach, med lab,
Level 15.

42:30.882 --> 42:34.301
Go. Let's get back to the Betty.
Doctor and soldier boy here
can see us to the door.

42:34.427 --> 42:36.553
What about Vriess?
Fuck Vriess.

42:47.899 --> 42:49.900
Your attention, please.

42:49.984 --> 42:53.278
Unauthorized opening
of cage three.

42:53.363 --> 42:57.074
Unauthorized opening
of cages five,

42:57.158 --> 43:00.327
seven, eight, 10-

43:00.411 --> 43:02.704
Move it! Now!
Evacuation.

43:02.789 --> 43:05.791
- Go! Go now!
- Evacuation.

43:15.885 --> 43:18.470
This is not a drill.

43:27.689 --> 43:30.232
- Evacuation.
- Move it! Go! Get on board!

43:31.275 --> 43:33.151
Your attention, please.

43:33.236 --> 43:34.861
Non-human presence detected,

43:34.946 --> 43:38.699
Levels 21, 23,

43:38.783 --> 43:42.869
27, 14,

43:42.954 --> 43:47.290
Level 38, Level 39.

43:47.750 --> 43:50.419
Evacuation.

43:50.503 --> 43:53.547
Proceed to lifeboats.

43:53.631 --> 43:55.674
This is not a drill.

43:55.758 --> 43:57.801
Thank you for your cooperation.

45:04.160 --> 45:08.163
I'll give you holes,
you slimy bastard!

45:12.960 --> 45:14.211
Move it! Let's go!

45:14.295 --> 45:16.922
Final lifeboat ready for launch.
- Get aboard!

45:22.470 --> 45:24.387
Go!

45:24.472 --> 45:26.932
Complete evacuation now.

45:36.108 --> 45:37.692
Grenade.

46:30.788 --> 46:34.040
Alert. Alert.

46:34.125 --> 46:36.167
Evacuation incomplete.

46:36.252 --> 46:41.548
Civilian presence detected
in area "H." Warning.

46:41.632 --> 46:45.468
Main vessel
declared uninhabitable.

46:53.185 --> 46:55.103
Elgyn, come on.
Let's move, man.

46:55.187 --> 46:57.147
Yeah.

48:16.936 --> 48:20.063
Elgyn? Elgyn, where are you?

48:29.490 --> 48:31.574
Elgyn, where are you?

48:35.037 --> 48:36.997
Elgyn?

49:14.577 --> 49:16.578
Elgyn!

49:16.662 --> 49:19.706
God. Elgyn?
Elgyn?

49:19.790 --> 49:22.208
Elgyn!

49:22.293 --> 49:25.003
Elgyn!

49:25.087 --> 49:27.672
Easy, Hillard!
Christie, give me a hand here!

49:27.798 --> 49:29.382
Get him up!
Give me a hand here!

49:29.508 --> 49:32.969
Come on! Let's get him up!
Move out of the way!

49:33.095 --> 49:34.971
No!
Ah, shit.

49:35.097 --> 49:37.807
What the fuck did this?
What's in this place?

49:43.981 --> 49:46.191
Call, get down!
- What the fuck is that?

49:46.275 --> 49:48.860
Don't shoot!
It's in front of the hull!

49:51.280 --> 49:52.739
What is that?

49:52.865 --> 49:56.493
Come on, man.
Time to go. Time to go!
Get back!

49:56.577 --> 49:59.454
Damn!

49:59.538 --> 50:02.707
Call, time to go!
Come on, Call!

50:02.833 --> 50:06.419
Get the goddamn door open!

50:06.504 --> 50:10.090
We can't open it!
We can't open the door!

50:14.178 --> 50:18.640
We gotta go back!
- I'm not going back!
You go back!

50:44.458 --> 50:47.752
What the fuck?

50:47.837 --> 50:49.921
Was it everything
you hoped for?

50:52.299 --> 50:54.217
Leave him alone!

51:03.602 --> 51:06.271
What do we do now, man?

51:06.397 --> 51:10.400
Same thing we're doin'.
Get the hell outta here!
What if there's more?

51:12.027 --> 51:15.572
I say we stay here, man.
Let the army guys deal.

51:15.656 --> 51:17.740
Where the fuck
are the army guys?

51:17.825 --> 51:20.160
They're dead!

51:20.244 --> 51:22.203
Well, then we don't need
this asshole anymore.

51:22.288 --> 51:24.205
- Step back!
- No, you step back!

51:24.290 --> 51:26.791
- Stop it!
- You got no authority here!

51:29.753 --> 51:32.463
Doctor, that thing
that killed my partner,

51:32.590 --> 51:36.092
that's your pet
science project?
Yes.

51:36.177 --> 51:39.512
- Let me do him right now, man!
- I should let him do you right now!

51:39.597 --> 51:42.140
How many more are there?

51:42.266 --> 51:45.560
How many more are there?
Twelve.

51:48.606 --> 51:51.941
Twelve?
- Twelve.

51:54.320 --> 51:56.571
Twelve.

51:56.655 --> 51:58.740
There'll be more.

52:00.326 --> 52:02.911
So,

52:02.995 --> 52:05.455
who do I have to fuck
to get off this boat?

52:07.791 --> 52:11.628
I can get you off.
Maybe not the boat, but-

52:12.922 --> 52:16.007
Let's get out of here.
No, wait a second here.

52:16.091 --> 52:18.092
She was the host
for these monsters.

52:18.177 --> 52:20.595
Wren cloned her because
she had one inside her.

52:20.679 --> 52:23.223
She's not human.

52:23.307 --> 52:27.310
She was part of his experiment,
and she will turn on us
in a second.

52:27.394 --> 52:29.312
I don't give a shit
what she is.

52:29.396 --> 52:32.106
She's too much of a risk.
We have to leave her.

52:32.191 --> 52:35.526
- She comes.
- We can't trust her!

52:35.611 --> 52:37.195
I don't trust anyone.

52:41.325 --> 52:44.452
If we’re gonna survive this mess,
we all stick together.

52:44.536 --> 52:46.537
Agreed?

52:57.466 --> 53:01.636
Hillard, we gotta go.
It's not over.
We gotta get to the Betty.

53:30.708 --> 53:32.875
Make a nice souvenir.

53:41.135 --> 53:43.720
I can't believe
you did that.

53:43.804 --> 53:46.180
Did what?
Killed one of 'em.

53:46.307 --> 53:49.309
It's like killing
your own kind.
It was in my way.

54:12.124 --> 54:14.876
Oh, man!

54:19.173 --> 54:22.133
Who were you expecting, Santa Claus?

54:22.217 --> 54:25.136
Thought you were toast
for certain, man.

54:25.220 --> 54:27.847
Shit. Where's Elgyn?

54:31.518 --> 54:33.436
Oh, shit.

54:33.520 --> 54:36.105
Hey, man, what if
we get to the Betty
and they're all over it?

54:36.231 --> 54:39.650
All the activity's been in the aft sector
by the barracks. Why would they move?
- They won't.

54:39.735 --> 54:41.652
If they send anyone out,

54:41.737 --> 54:43.988
it'll be, uh, here,

54:45.157 --> 54:47.325
where the meat is.

54:47.409 --> 54:51.621
Yeah. Well, I say
if we wanna make any decent time,
I say we ditch the cripple.

54:53.540 --> 54:57.126
- No offense, man.
- None taken.

54:57.211 --> 55:00.296
Nobody is left behind.
Not even you, Johner.

55:02.549 --> 55:05.301
- What's the quickest way out of here?
- After the cooling tower,

55:05.386 --> 55:06.969
there's a freight elevator.

55:07.054 --> 55:10.473
It runs from the top
of the ship down to
Engineering Level 1 deck.

55:10.557 --> 55:14.769
- Take us straight to the dock.
- Sounds reasonable. Let's do it.

55:16.063 --> 55:17.105
We're moving.

55:18.565 --> 55:20.566
What?
The ship is moving.

55:20.651 --> 55:22.360
I can feel it.

55:22.444 --> 55:25.822
The ship has stealth run.
There's no way you can tell.

55:26.990 --> 55:28.950
She's right.

55:29.034 --> 55:31.828
The ship's been go since the attack.

55:31.912 --> 55:34.914
That's a standard
emergency procedure.
That's right.

55:34.998 --> 55:38.418
Any serious problem,
and the ship autopilots
back to home base.

55:38.502 --> 55:40.753
And you were planning
on letting us know this?

55:40.838 --> 55:42.588
Nobody asked.

55:42.673 --> 55:46.008
What's home base?

55:47.511 --> 55:49.387
Earth.

55:49.471 --> 55:51.848
Oh, great.

55:51.932 --> 55:54.809
Bastard.
Earth?

55:54.893 --> 55:56.853
I'd rather stay here
with the things, man.

55:56.937 --> 55:59.147
How long until we get to Earth?

55:59.231 --> 56:00.940
Three hours almost.

56:01.024 --> 56:03.151
We gotta blow the ship.

56:03.235 --> 56:05.987
Call, you're not blowing this ship.

56:06.071 --> 56:08.364
Not while we're on it, okay?

56:09.533 --> 56:12.577
We get out of this shit,
you do as you please,
all right?

56:14.037 --> 56:17.665
Earth, man.
What a shit-hole.

56:25.716 --> 56:27.758
It's clear.

56:33.849 --> 56:35.850
Hey, Ripley.

56:39.605 --> 56:43.149
I heard you, like,
ran into these things before.

56:44.234 --> 56:47.653
That's right.
Wow, man.

56:47.738 --> 56:51.073
So, like, what did you do?

56:53.994 --> 56:55.995
I died.

57:22.272 --> 57:24.273
Not that way!

57:28.737 --> 57:30.738
Ripley.

57:37.329 --> 57:39.330
Ripley, come on.

57:42.751 --> 57:45.586
Ripley, we got no time
for sightseeing here.

57:50.050 --> 57:52.468
Ripley, don't.

59:51.129 --> 59:53.130
Hel—

59:54.174 --> 59:57.593
Kill... me.

01:00:08.063 --> 01:00:10.106
Kill me.

01:01:50.665 --> 01:01:53.083
Don't do it, Ripley.

01:02:01.676 --> 01:02:03.803
Don't do what?

01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:18.526
What's the big deal, man?

01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:20.694
Fuckin' waste of ammo.

01:02:20.779 --> 01:02:22.780
Let's go.

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:26.492
Must be a chick thing.

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:39.982
Am I dreaming, or is this not
the shit we brought with us?

01:03:40.066 --> 01:03:42.443
Yeah, it's the same shit.

01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:46.363
Stinks in here, man.
Let's keep moving.

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:22.524
Get away from me!
Get away from me!

01:04:22.651 --> 01:04:24.568
Drop the rod, man.
Get away from me!

01:04:24.653 --> 01:04:27.237
- Do it!
- Get away from me.

01:04:28.239 --> 01:04:31.617
Get away from me.

01:04:33.161 --> 01:04:35.245
Who are you people?

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:38.499
What's happening here?
Calm down.

01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:42.586
What's happening here is
we're getting the fuck off
this ghost ship, okay?

01:04:43.588 --> 01:04:45.506
Ship? What ship?

01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:49.593
Where am I?

01:04:49.678 --> 01:04:53.222
I was in cryo, right?
On my way to Xarem, right?

01:04:53.306 --> 01:04:55.849
Work crew for the nickel
refinery, right?

01:04:55.934 --> 01:04:58.811
I wake up.
I know I don't understand.

01:05:00.647 --> 01:05:05.484
Oh, God. Uh, I s- I saw—
I saw horrible things.

01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:09.405
Look, you're coming with us.
It's too dangerous for you here.

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:21.667
Leave him.

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:24.545
Fuck you.
We're not leaving him here.

01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:28.507
He's got one inside of him.

01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:30.592
I can smell it.

01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:34.304
Inside me?

01:05:36.057 --> 01:05:39.435
Inside me?
What's inside me?
Hey, man.

01:05:39.519 --> 01:05:42.062
I don't want one of those things
birthing anywhere near my ass.

01:05:42.147 --> 01:05:43.480
It's a bad risk.

01:05:44.858 --> 01:05:48.610
- What's inside me?
- Look, we can't just leave him here.

01:05:48.695 --> 01:05:51.071
- I thought you came here
to stop 'em from spreadin'.
- What's inside me?

01:05:51.156 --> 01:05:54.283
There's gotta be a process.
Can't you stop it?
- Got no time for that.

01:05:54.367 --> 01:05:57.036
- I can't do it here.
The lab is out of order.
- What's inside me?

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.288
I could do him.
Back of the head.

01:05:59.372 --> 01:06:01.749
Painless.
It might be the best way.

01:06:01.833 --> 01:06:04.334
- What's inside me?
- No, there's got
to be another way.

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:07.671
What if we freeze him?
What's in-fuckin'-side me?

01:06:07.756 --> 01:06:08.922
A parasite!

01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:13.343
Foreign element.

01:06:18.892 --> 01:06:21.393
There's a monster in your chest.

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:25.439
These guys
hijacked your ship,

01:06:25.523 --> 01:06:27.483
and they sold
your cryo tube...

01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:30.444
to this... human,

01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:33.864
and he put an alien inside of you.

01:06:33.948 --> 01:06:35.908
It's a really nasty one.

01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:40.996
And in a few hours,
it's gonna burst its way
through your rib cage...

01:06:41.081 --> 01:06:43.624
and you're gonna die.

01:06:49.089 --> 01:06:50.798
Any questions?

01:06:58.014 --> 01:06:59.932
Who are you?

01:07:01.726 --> 01:07:03.644
I'm the monster's mother.

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:09.817
Look, he comes with us,
we freeze him on the Betty,

01:07:09.901 --> 01:07:12.277
- then the doctor
can remove it later.
- Fine with me.

01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:14.696
Since when were you
in goddamn charge?

01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:18.117
- Since you were born without balls!
- Ease off, people.

01:07:27.335 --> 01:07:31.171
All right.
You come with us.
You might even live.

01:07:31.256 --> 01:07:34.091
Get twitchy on me,
and you'll be shot.

01:07:35.635 --> 01:07:37.636
Let's move out.

01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:51.483
It's a mess down there!
Is this the only way?

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:54.778
Vriess, we gotta lose
the chair.

01:07:56.781 --> 01:07:58.740
I know.

01:07:58.825 --> 01:08:00.909
Kawlang maneuver,
all right?

01:08:01.035 --> 01:08:04.163
Yeah, just like old times.
Yeah.

01:08:09.127 --> 01:08:11.461
Must be the cooling tanks.

01:08:11.546 --> 01:08:14.131
Somebody must have
opened the valves.

01:08:14.215 --> 01:08:16.884
The nasties couldn't have
done this, could they?

01:08:28.813 --> 01:08:31.356
We're at the bottom
of the ship.

01:08:31.441 --> 01:08:34.568
We have to go through
the kitchen, maybe 90 feet,

01:08:34.652 --> 01:08:37.196
to the freight elevator
on the other side.

01:08:38.656 --> 01:08:41.450
- I don't like it.
- What's to like?

01:08:43.328 --> 01:08:44.953
This sucks!

01:08:45.037 --> 01:08:48.624
- Wren, are you sure
about the distance?
- Yes.

01:08:50.042 --> 01:08:52.461
- You ready to get wet, partner?
- Yeah.

01:09:01.511 --> 01:09:04.973
Hey, uh, do your weapons
fire underwater?

01:09:05.058 --> 01:09:09.102
- Yeah, they're disposables.
They can take it.
- Disposables?

01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:15.943
Hey, I heard about those. Yeah.

01:09:17.528 --> 01:09:20.948
- How many rounds?
- Twenty.

01:09:21.032 --> 01:09:24.576
Split points give you a good hole,
even at the smaller caliber.

01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:27.746
Oh. Hey, that's cool.

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:31.291
Yeah. They're big with hitters
'cause you, uh, throw 'em away
after the job.

01:09:31.376 --> 01:09:34.502
Nobody likes to throw away
a weapon they're attached to.
You know what I mean?

01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:36.255
Yeah.

01:09:36.339 --> 01:09:39.424
Guess I don't have to tell everyone
to take a deep breath.

01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:47.515
Hey, Christie,
do me a favor.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.519
When we hit the surface
on the other side,

01:09:50.603 --> 01:09:53.272
no backstroke, okay?

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:27.694
Jesus Christ!

01:13:40.666 --> 01:13:42.626
They set a goddamn trap.

01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:44.628
It's a goddamn ambush!

01:14:50.695 --> 01:14:52.320
Distephano!

01:15:11.966 --> 01:15:14.759
It won't break.
Give me your weapon.

01:15:17.471 --> 01:15:19.514
You really are way too trusting.

01:15:19.599 --> 01:15:33.236
No!

01:15:40.786 --> 01:15:43.872
You killed her!
You bastard!

01:15:48.711 --> 01:15:51.671
I'll get you!

01:15:52.423 --> 01:15:54.424
Father, lock the door.

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:13.151
Christie! Climb! Climb!

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:14.778
I'm doin' it, man!
Come on!

01:16:14.862 --> 01:16:17.113
Come on!

01:16:17.198 --> 01:16:19.991
It’s jammed!
Move it!

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:22.994
It’s jammed!

01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:57.237
Get off my foot, bitch!

01:17:05.371 --> 01:17:07.372
Get off me!

01:17:09.083 --> 01:17:11.918
Johner!

01:17:12.002 --> 01:17:14.129
Get off me!
Get off me!

01:17:14.213 --> 01:17:17.757
Aaah! Johner!

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:23.513
Die, motherfucker!

01:17:25.599 --> 01:17:28.143
Do it, man!

01:17:29.353 --> 01:17:30.854
Hey!

01:17:44.535 --> 01:17:46.995
Real nice party, ain't it?

01:18:15.024 --> 01:18:18.777
Christie! Christie!

01:18:20.154 --> 01:18:23.031
Christie! No!

01:18:23.115 --> 01:18:27.494
Christie!

01:18:27.578 --> 01:18:31.080
What are you doing?
Don't do it!

01:18:31.165 --> 01:18:34.667
Don't!
We can make it!

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:37.170
No!

01:18:39.965 --> 01:18:42.383
Damn!

01:19:30.182 --> 01:19:31.724
This way.

01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:37.063
Come on!

01:19:41.527 --> 01:19:44.153
Baby, am I glad to see you.

01:19:44.238 --> 01:19:47.156
I was sure that asshole got you.
Are you hurt?

01:19:47.241 --> 01:19:49.409
I'm fine.

01:19:49.493 --> 01:19:52.871
You got body armor on?
Yeah. Come on.

01:19:52.955 --> 01:19:55.456
You took it in the chest.
I saw it.

01:20:17.563 --> 01:20:19.272
You're a robot?

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:24.319
Son of a bitch!
Our little Call
is just full of surprises.

01:20:24.403 --> 01:20:28.531
I should have known.
No human being is that humane.

01:20:28.616 --> 01:20:31.117
I thought synthetics
were supposed to be
all logical and shit.

01:20:31.201 --> 01:20:33.786
You’re just
a big old psycho, girl.

01:20:33.871 --> 01:20:37.081
- You're a robot?
- You're a second gen, aren't you?

01:20:38.626 --> 01:20:40.877
You're an Auton.

01:20:40.961 --> 01:20:45.214
Robots designed
by robots, right?
Hah!

01:20:45.299 --> 01:20:47.342
Oh, yeah. That's right.
I remember.

01:20:47.426 --> 01:20:50.136
Now, they were
supposed to revitalize
the synthetic industry.

01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:52.138
Instead, they buried it.

01:20:52.222 --> 01:20:55.808
They didn't like
being told what to do.

01:20:55.893 --> 01:20:58.144
Government ordered
a recall.

01:20:58.228 --> 01:21:00.480
Now, I heard—
I had— I had heard...

01:21:00.564 --> 01:21:03.483
that only a few-
just a few-
had gotten out intact.

01:21:03.567 --> 01:21:06.736
Man, I never, never thought
that I would see one!

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:11.074
Great. She's a toaster oven.

01:21:11.158 --> 01:21:13.868
Can we leave now?

01:21:13.953 --> 01:21:16.996
How long before we land?

01:21:17.122 --> 01:21:20.083
Just under two hours.
Hey, Vriess.

01:21:20.167 --> 01:21:22.293
You got a socket wrench?
Maybe she just needs
an oil change.

01:21:22.419 --> 01:21:26.255
I'm sorry. Access denied.
I can't believe I almost fucked it.

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:28.091
Yeah, like you
never fucked a robot!

01:21:28.217 --> 01:21:31.678
You know, if Wren gets in the computer,
he could really screw us.

01:21:31.804 --> 01:21:34.681
We gotta find a terminal.
No, there's no console
on this level.

01:21:34.807 --> 01:21:37.266
We'd have to go back.
Well, we can't go back.

01:21:37.351 --> 01:21:39.978
- And I don't know
any of Wren’s access codes.
- Help me.

01:21:42.022 --> 01:21:44.023
Call.

01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:46.818
No. I can't.

01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:49.112
Right. You're the new model droid.

01:21:49.238 --> 01:21:52.824
You can access
the mainframe by remote.
No, I can't.

01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:55.410
I burned my modem.
We all did.

01:21:55.494 --> 01:21:59.205
Call, you can still patch in manually.
You know that.

01:21:59.289 --> 01:22:02.959
There's ports
in the chapel, up there.

01:22:04.670 --> 01:22:06.170
Call.

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:15.221
You're programmed
for that?
Don't make me do this.

01:22:15.305 --> 01:22:17.056
Don't make me make you.

01:22:17.141 --> 01:22:20.977
I don't want to go in there.

01:22:21.061 --> 01:22:23.855
It's like my insides are liquid.
It's not real.

01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:26.065
Get over it.

01:22:26.150 --> 01:22:28.234
You can blow the ship
before it reaches Earth...

01:22:28.318 --> 01:22:30.194
and kill them all.

01:22:40.664 --> 01:22:43.332
Just give us time
to get out first.

01:22:46.045 --> 01:22:48.546
Damn it.
Anything?

01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:50.381
Hold on.

01:22:54.762 --> 01:22:57.930
Breach in Sector 7,
Sector 3.

01:22:59.058 --> 01:23:01.100
Sector 9 unstable.

01:23:02.186 --> 01:23:05.021
Engines operating at 41 %.

01:23:05.105 --> 01:23:08.107
Eighty-six minutes
until Earth dock.

01:23:08.192 --> 01:23:10.568
We burned too much energy.

01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:13.946
I can't make critical mass.
I can't blow it.

01:23:14.031 --> 01:23:16.115
Then crash it.

01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:21.329
Yeah.

01:23:30.005 --> 01:23:32.673
I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:23:34.301 --> 01:23:36.302
Really.

01:23:36.386 --> 01:23:38.805
I feel good.

01:23:38.889 --> 01:23:42.100
Ground level recalibrated.

01:23:42.184 --> 01:23:45.686
New destination:
7-6-0-4-0-3.

01:23:45.771 --> 01:23:48.231
Uninhabited quadrant.

01:23:48.315 --> 01:23:51.192
Braking systems off-lined.
Acceleration increase.

01:23:53.612 --> 01:23:57.198
Time until impact now
43 minutes, 8 seconds.

01:23:58.742 --> 01:24:01.285
Try to clear us a path
to the Betty...

01:24:02.371 --> 01:24:04.205
and start her up.

01:24:04.289 --> 01:24:06.290
Okay.

01:24:33.694 --> 01:24:35.820
Please wait.

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:44.370
Emergency override
in console 45V, Level 1.

01:24:48.417 --> 01:24:51.544
It's Wren.
He's almost at the Betty.

01:25:03.098 --> 01:25:07.393
Father, locate
the power drain. Report.

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:13.191
Father? Father!

01:25:18.447 --> 01:25:21.032
Father's dead, asshole.

01:25:24.286 --> 01:25:26.204
Intruder on Level 1.

01:25:26.288 --> 01:25:30.333
All aliens,
please proceed to Level 1.

01:25:30.417 --> 01:25:32.710
You got a mean streak.

01:25:37.174 --> 01:25:39.800
Damn it.
Let me see.

01:25:39.885 --> 01:25:42.178
- Don't touch me.
- Come on.

01:25:43.847 --> 01:25:46.265
You must think
this is pretty funny.

01:25:47.601 --> 01:25:50.645
I'm finding a lot of things
funny lately,

01:25:50.729 --> 01:25:52.772
but I don't think they are.

01:25:59.905 --> 01:26:02.740
Why do you go on living?

01:26:05.327 --> 01:26:07.745
How can you stand
being what you are?

01:26:09.122 --> 01:26:11.082
Not much choice.

01:26:15.379 --> 01:26:17.797
At least there's
a part of you that's human.

01:26:17.881 --> 01:26:22.134
I'm just— Look at me.

01:26:23.262 --> 01:26:25.304
I'm disgusting.

01:26:27.224 --> 01:26:29.642
Why did you come here?

01:26:29.726 --> 01:26:31.811
To kill you,
remember?

01:26:31.895 --> 01:26:34.188
Before the recall,

01:26:34.273 --> 01:26:36.274
I accessed the mainframe.

01:26:37.276 --> 01:26:40.611
Every dirty little covert op
the government ever
dreamed of is in there.

01:26:40.696 --> 01:26:44.407
And this-you, the aliens,

01:26:44.491 --> 01:26:48.494
even the crew from the Betty-
I knew if they succeeded,
it would be the end of them.

01:26:49.579 --> 01:26:51.664
Why do you care
what happens to them?

01:26:52.791 --> 01:26:54.625
Because I'm programmed to.

01:26:54.710 --> 01:26:57.753
You're programmed
to be an asshole?

01:26:58.797 --> 01:27:02.008
You're the new asshole model
they're putting out?

01:27:02.092 --> 01:27:03.509
Come on.

01:27:05.721 --> 01:27:08.389
I couldn't watch 'em do it.

01:27:08.473 --> 01:27:11.559
I couldn't let 'em
annihilate themselves.

01:27:11.643 --> 01:27:13.769
Do you understand that?

01:27:17.482 --> 01:27:19.400
I did once.

01:27:19.484 --> 01:27:22.153
I tried to save...
people.

01:27:23.238 --> 01:27:25.906
It didn't work out.

01:27:25.991 --> 01:27:28.326
There was this girl.

01:27:30.829 --> 01:27:32.788
She had bad dreams.

01:27:33.999 --> 01:27:36.000
I tried to help her.

01:27:37.169 --> 01:27:39.170
She died.

01:27:40.297 --> 01:27:42.882
Now I can't even
remember her name.

01:27:47.763 --> 01:27:49.680
I guess we're almost there.

01:27:49.765 --> 01:27:51.807
Right.

01:27:52.976 --> 01:27:54.977
Do you dream?

01:27:55.062 --> 01:27:59.607
I— Well, we have
neuroprocessors that- Yes.

01:27:59.691 --> 01:28:03.110
When I sleep,
I dream about them— it.

01:28:03.195 --> 01:28:07.490
Every night.
All around me, in me.

01:28:07.574 --> 01:28:10.910
I used to be
afraid to dream,
but I'm not anymore.

01:28:10.994 --> 01:28:13.579
Why?

01:28:13.663 --> 01:28:15.664
Because no matter
how bad the dreams get,

01:28:15.749 --> 01:28:17.875
when I wake up,
it's always worse.

01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:25.591
It's not so far now!
- God, I'm so tired.

01:28:25.675 --> 01:28:27.593
Sleep when you die, man.

01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:41.398
Oh, no. This is bad, right?

01:28:41.483 --> 01:28:45.361
- I think we're near the nest.
- Well, then we'll go another way.

01:28:45.487 --> 01:28:48.280
We don't have time.
We got nearly 90 minutes.

01:28:48.365 --> 01:28:50.407
- Not anymore.
- What are you saying?

01:28:50.492 --> 01:28:54.453
- What did you do, robot?
- Let's go. Come on.

01:28:54.538 --> 01:28:58.874
Hey! You want to die here
with your little brothers
and sisters, that's cool!

01:28:58.959 --> 01:29:01.377
But I plan to live past today!

01:29:01.461 --> 01:29:03.963
If this little hunk of plastic
is pulling any shit,

01:29:04.047 --> 01:29:06.048
I'm gonna kill her!

01:29:07.092 --> 01:29:10.219
Kill you!
Does that compute?

01:29:10.303 --> 01:29:12.388
Or do I have to
draw you a schematic?

01:29:12.514 --> 01:29:15.141
Hey!

01:29:17.644 --> 01:29:20.938
You want another souvenir?

01:29:26.653 --> 01:29:29.780
- How far are the docks?
- A h-hundred yards.

01:29:40.917 --> 01:29:46.213
Ripley.

01:29:47.215 --> 01:29:49.425
Come on.

01:29:49.509 --> 01:29:51.802
Ripley, we have to go.

01:29:53.388 --> 01:29:55.389
I hear them.

01:29:55.473 --> 01:29:58.184
I hear them.
They're so close.

01:29:58.268 --> 01:30:00.186
Ripley.
It's the queen.

01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:03.439
She's in pain.

01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:07.776
Ripley!

01:30:08.987 --> 01:30:11.238
Ripley!

01:30:11.323 --> 01:30:13.324
Wait!

01:30:34.804 --> 01:30:36.555
Oh, my God.

01:30:49.319 --> 01:30:51.237
We gotta be moving.

01:30:51.321 --> 01:30:54.907
The best thing you can do
is pray for a quick death.

01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:57.743
Come on. Come on.

01:30:57.827 --> 01:30:59.745
It's not right.

01:30:59.829 --> 01:31:02.206
I've been saying that all day.

01:31:59.514 --> 01:32:01.515
It's up to you now, Call.

01:32:01.599 --> 01:32:04.310
I need you to patch into
the ship again and open the hatch.

01:32:15.613 --> 01:32:18.449
Johner, we should put Purvis
in the freezer now.

01:32:18.533 --> 01:32:20.451
All right, little buddy.

01:32:21.786 --> 01:32:24.121
Nap time.

01:32:28.293 --> 01:32:30.878
Oh!

01:32:30.962 --> 01:32:33.088
Nobody moves,
or I put a cap...

01:32:33.173 --> 01:32:35.299
right where
this little droid's brain is.

01:32:35.383 --> 01:32:38.177
Distephano, take the weapons.

01:32:38.261 --> 01:32:40.637
Begging your pardon, sir,
but fuck you!

01:32:40.722 --> 01:32:44.475
Oh, fine. Then I kill her,
and you kill me,

01:32:44.559 --> 01:32:47.561
and we all die,
and nobody goes home!

01:32:47.645 --> 01:32:50.481
Now drop the weapon.

01:32:54.736 --> 01:32:56.904
Then this little
synthetic bitch...

01:32:56.988 --> 01:32:59.323
is gonna plug into the Auriga,

01:32:59.407 --> 01:33:01.700
and she is gonna take us
right back to home base,

01:33:01.785 --> 01:33:04.244
according to the standard
emergency procedures.

01:33:04.329 --> 01:33:07.581
No, she's not.
Are you crazy?

01:33:07.665 --> 01:33:09.708
You still want to bring
those things back to Earth?

01:33:09.793 --> 01:33:13.462
- Haven't you been paying
any attention today?
- Ah, the intellectual speaks.

01:33:14.172 --> 01:33:15.964
Stay there!
Listen, if you don't—

01:33:16.049 --> 01:33:18.133
Don't you ever shut up?

01:33:30.397 --> 01:33:33.524
Why does nobody listen to me?

01:34:15.608 --> 01:34:19.611
I told you.
At first, everything was normal.

01:34:19.696 --> 01:34:22.739
The queen laid her eggs.
But then she started to change.

01:34:22.824 --> 01:34:25.534
She added a second cycle cell.

01:34:28.746 --> 01:34:30.747
So,

01:34:34.919 --> 01:34:38.297
this time there is no host.

01:34:38.381 --> 01:34:40.883
There are no eggs.

01:34:40.967 --> 01:34:44.678
There is only her womb...

01:34:44.762 --> 01:34:47.556
and the creature inside.

01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:50.517
That is Ripley's gift to her:

01:34:50.602 --> 01:34:54.354
a human reproductive system.

01:34:54.439 --> 01:34:57.733
She is giving birth
for you, Ripley,

01:34:57.817 --> 01:35:01.445
and now she is perfect!

01:36:27.448 --> 01:36:30.784
You are...

01:36:30.868 --> 01:36:33.787
a beautiful,

01:36:33.871 --> 01:36:36.790
beautiful butterfly.

01:37:03.693 --> 01:37:06.278
No.

01:37:10.867 --> 01:37:12.326
No. No.

01:38:07.048 --> 01:38:09.633
Ah, look. Look.

01:38:09.717 --> 01:38:13.512
Beautiful, beautiful
little baby.

01:38:14.639 --> 01:38:18.308
Look. It thinks
you're its mother.

01:38:20.853 --> 01:38:23.355
Come on.

01:38:23.439 --> 01:38:25.607
Come on.

01:38:28.986 --> 01:38:33.281
Yeah.

01:38:34.409 --> 01:38:37.452
Come on.

01:38:53.761 --> 01:38:56.054
Civilian vessel on line.

01:38:56.139 --> 01:38:58.306
Emergency departure
authorized.

01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:06.815
All right. She's hot.
I'll open the Auriga's air locks,
pull the holding clamps on your mark.

01:39:06.899 --> 01:39:09.568
Right. I-I just need
to find, uh, the, uh—

01:39:09.652 --> 01:39:12.362
th-the vertical thrust lock.

01:39:17.618 --> 01:39:20.495
Are you sure you guys
can fly this thing?
Yes!

01:39:34.927 --> 01:39:38.263
Launch status is go.
- No!

01:39:40.057 --> 01:39:41.933
Ripley.

01:40:09.962 --> 01:40:12.714
- Hey.
- I thought you were dead.

01:40:12.799 --> 01:40:16.384
Yeah, I get that a lot.
Why are we still here?

01:40:16.469 --> 01:40:21.306
Uh, I'm just, uh, finding
the, uh, manual override.

01:40:21.390 --> 01:40:23.391
For Christ's sake.
Hey, Ripley.

01:40:23.476 --> 01:40:25.769
Good memory. Excuse me.

01:40:25.853 --> 01:40:27.270
Ripley's back, man.
Is that it?

01:40:27.355 --> 01:40:29.564
Nope.

01:40:29.649 --> 01:40:31.817
You can't fly one of
these things too, can you?

01:40:31.901 --> 01:40:35.028
Are you kidding?
This piece of shit
is even older than I am.

01:40:35.112 --> 01:40:38.573
Goddamn it.
We've still got breach. The hatch.

01:40:38.658 --> 01:40:41.701
- I closed it.
- Fixed the goddamn hatch
a hundred times, man!

01:40:41.786 --> 01:40:44.496
I'll get it. I'll get it.

01:41:05.685 --> 01:41:08.520
Approaching Earth's atmosphere.

01:41:08.604 --> 01:41:12.941
Window of departure
now 46 seconds.

01:41:14.443 --> 01:41:17.237
Call, we have to go.

01:41:17.321 --> 01:41:19.823
Call.

01:41:22.451 --> 01:41:24.703
We've gotta get out of here.

01:41:29.125 --> 01:41:33.044
Window of departure
now 20 seconds.

01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:40.302
Grab on to something, Call.
We're outta here.

01:41:55.651 --> 01:41:56.818
Come on, baby.

01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:12.500
This thing is gonna fall apart.

01:42:13.502 --> 01:42:16.171
Pressure's unstable!

01:42:20.426 --> 01:42:23.803
Go help Call turn on
the auxiliary pump!

01:42:50.790 --> 01:42:52.290
Distephano?

01:43:13.813 --> 01:43:16.481
Come on! Step on it!

01:43:16.565 --> 01:43:19.275
Hey, I'm not the mechanic
here, Ironsides!

01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:21.277
I mostly just hurt people!

01:43:22.321 --> 01:43:24.447
Shit. Call!

01:43:25.992 --> 01:43:28.785
Call, get back up here!

01:43:29.954 --> 01:43:32.414
Call! Call!

01:43:33.457 --> 01:43:37.127
Ripley!
Hey, Ripley!

01:43:41.924 --> 01:43:44.384
Johner, where are you,
you son of a bitch?

01:43:44.468 --> 01:43:47.721
- Get on it, bastard!
- What am I supposed to do?

01:43:47.805 --> 01:43:49.764
Grab the sticks.

01:44:03.446 --> 01:44:05.113
Put her down.

01:44:24.759 --> 01:44:26.760
Oh.

01:45:42.878 --> 01:45:45.588
Ripley!

01:46:03.899 --> 01:46:06.860
Oh, no!

01:46:06.944 --> 01:46:09.487
Oh, no!

01:46:12.116 --> 01:46:14.450
I'm sorry.

01:46:17.121 --> 01:46:20.165
No!

01:46:44.648 --> 01:46:47.859
U.S.M. Auriga
will impact in five seconds.

01:46:47.943 --> 01:46:51.070
Four. Three.

01:46:51.155 --> 01:46:53.573
Two. One.

01:46:53.657 --> 01:46:54.782
Thank you.

01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:21.809
- What's burnin'?
- Us!

01:47:24.396 --> 01:47:28.358
Shit! You're right!

01:48:47.271 --> 01:48:49.355
So this is Earth, huh?

01:48:51.567 --> 01:48:53.568
This is Earth.

01:48:57.114 --> 01:48:59.157
This is
my first time here.

01:49:03.454 --> 01:49:07.832
I suppose the military will be
sniffing around here pretty soon.

01:49:07.916 --> 01:49:10.001
Bet you're not
too anxious to see them.

01:49:10.919 --> 01:49:12.837
Not really.

01:49:13.881 --> 01:49:16.966
You know,
a person could get pretty lost
around here if they wanted to.

01:49:19.136 --> 01:49:21.721
What do you think?

01:49:21.805 --> 01:49:23.931
What should we do?

01:49:25.309 --> 01:49:27.310
I don't know.

01:49:28.604 --> 01:49:30.813
I'm a stranger here myself.
