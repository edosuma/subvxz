So, what are you in the mood for?

01:11.196 --> 01:13.232
Oh, I'm in the mood.

01:15.825 --> 01:18.111
Just not for breakfast.

01:25.376 --> 01:27.162

01:28.254 --> 01:30.210
The bedroom's upstairs.

01:30.381 --> 01:31.791
Mm-hm.

01:32.217 --> 01:36.256
But the porch swing is out there.

01:47.357 --> 01:48.437
Target is on the move.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.975
He's heading for the Kent farm.

01:59.702 --> 02:02.489
Target closing in on farmhouse.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.872
-Daddy.
-General Lane.

02:18.805 --> 02:21.888
-And Lucy.
-Happy Turkey Day, sis.

02:23.226 --> 02:27.811
Great. The whole Lane family
is together for the holidays.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.659
Don't be nervous. Your dad just wants
to spend time with you.

03:28.833 --> 03:31.825
He's interested in doing recon
on the man dating his daughter.

03:32.003 --> 03:34.460
Hopefully someone's monogram jacket
has vanished.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.041
Your dad has met me before.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.548
Before we were a couple.
None of my boyfriends...

03:38.718 --> 03:41.334

Fine? "Fine" won't pass inspection.
You have to be perfect.

03:46.851 --> 03:48.887
It's important to me
that my dad likes you.

03:49.062 --> 03:52.975
It's important to me that you're happy.
There's nothing to worry about.

03:53.942 --> 03:57.309
Except maybe if he ﬁnds out
that you're a superhero.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.819
My dad hates superheroes.

04:06.537 --> 04:10.029
-Hey.
-Oh, that's a good cup of coffee.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.744
Make yourself at home, Daddy.

04:11.960 --> 04:16.044
Your sister's still upstairs unpacking.
She could be all day.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.375
It's good to see you, sir.

04:23.346 --> 04:29.012
So nothing much has changed
around here.

04:29.185 --> 04:30.721
You mother still own the place?

04:30.895 --> 04:33.011
-It is in her name, but I—
-I see.

04:33.189 --> 04:34.929
You live in your mother's house...

04:35.108 --> 04:38.066
...and you work in a basement.
Is that correct?

Well, it is the bullpen

She seems

What exactly do you do
with your time, Clark?

04:52.542 --> 04:54.624
Hey, Daddy, uh,
Clark and | work together a lot.

04:54.794 --> 04:59.788
He just gives me the byline sometimes,
and that's just how sweet he is.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.542
-We look after each other.
LANE: Good.

05:03.886 --> 05:06.923
Because if Lois is gonna be spending
any time around here—

05:07.098 --> 05:08.213
I've had a look around.

05:08.391 --> 05:11.804
--there's a few things that are gonna
have to be brought up to code.

05:15.732 --> 05:18.223
Like scrubbing the bathroom tile
with a toothbrush?

05:18.401 --> 05:20.437
That's number 17 on the list.

05:25.575 --> 05:28.317
-You're not kidding.
-No, I never do.

05:29.245 --> 05:32.282
Though I feel a little uncomfortable
inspecting the enemy camp.

05:32.457 --> 05:36.291
Your mother is my major opposition
in the senate.

05:37.170 --> 05:40.082
Oh, does this mean
you're ﬁnally running for ofﬁce, Daddy?

05:40.298 --> 05:43.290
No, sweetheart. I'm the senior
military adviser on a new bill:

05:43.468 --> 05:45.584
the Vigilante Registration Act.

05:46.262 --> 05:48.048
And by "vigilante" you mean...?

05:48.264 --> 05:52.803
Vigilantes. Weekend warriors in masks
who run around inciting anarchy.

05:53.269 --> 05:55.430
Well, I don't think they incite anarchy.

05:58.941 --> 06:02.308
-They stop crime, protect people.
-And they commit acts of terrorism.

06:03.196 --> 06:07.155
Like the RAO Tower in Metropolis,
blown to kingdom come.

06:07.658 --> 06:09.944
No evidence of explosives.
You wanna know why?

06:10.119 --> 06:13.282
-Because one of them super-freaks did it.
-You know what?

06:13.498 --> 06:15.454
Since we're pretending it's a holiday...

06:15.625 --> 06:18.958
...what say we make it ofﬁcial
and take a furlough from work?

06:19.796 --> 06:22.458
Clark, do you know
who the real heroes of the world are?

06:22.673 --> 06:25.631
The men and women of
our Armed Forces. They have to enlist...

06:25.802 --> 06:28.635
...go through background checks,
training. There are rules.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.887
Be held accountable for their actions.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.715
People start believing
in these so-called superheroes...

06:33.893 --> 06:35.679
...soon the superheroes form cells...

06:35.853 --> 06:38.310
...start taking the law
into their own hands.

06:38.481 --> 06:42.850
No, I will not let them compromise
our national security. Mm-mm.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.352
Lois, what do you think?

06:51.202 --> 06:54.160
I think we need some veggies
with our starches.

06:55.331 --> 06:56.992
Baked or mashed?

06:59.043 --> 07:02.661
Whatever the general would like,
of course.

07:18.187 --> 07:19.893
You know, when you need ﬁrst aid...

07:20.064 --> 07:23.522
...you expect it
to be in the ﬁrst place you look.

Look at this. New chairs.
Got a whole new setup going on.

07:32.869 --> 07:36.361

I didn't think you'd actually move in.

-Yeah.

Somewhere between chasing
the bad guy and dodging the press...

08:01.063 --> 08:04.396
...I ran into someone
who literally had an ax to grind.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.432
That sounds like
some serious overtime.

08:07.111 --> 08:11.946
But if I remember correctly, your cure-all
was two raw eggs in a Belgian beer, hmm?

do this whole 9-to-5 thing with you...

Something's happening
beneath the surface.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.722
It's a sub-dermal tattoo.

This is the signal for the Suicide Squad.

When I was working
for Amanda Waller...

08:58.454 --> 09:01.537
...there were certain dirty jobs

09:01.749 --> 09:05.116
Not even us.
And Waller would send in the Squad.

09:05.294 --> 09:06.955

and then wanted to kiss and make up.

-Kent is a vigilante sympathizer.

17:51.612 --> 17:56.276
Whether he knows it or not, he's helping
agitators who want nothing more...

17:56.450 --> 17:59.783
...than to stop your father
from completing his current mission.

18:04.291 --> 18:07.249
That's a very serious accusation.

18:07.836 --> 18:08.951
Do you have proof?

18:13.967 --> 18:17.960
-Get this to your father.
-Why not just deliver it to him yourself?

18:18.138 --> 18:22.051
We don't want to arouse
Kent's suspicions.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.974
For your father's protection,
it's best if he not know...

18:25.145 --> 18:26.555
...that you got this from me.

18:26.772 --> 18:30.685
Just tell him you found it on the farm.
He'll know what to do.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.865
Could you also plant this on him?

18:44.039 --> 18:47.531
It's a homing device.
It'll help us track and protect him.

18:49.378 --> 18:52.711
The US Army
is depending on you, Lucy.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.164
And so is your father.

19:00.722 --> 19:02.178
You can count on me.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.056
Go make your father proud.

19:18.031 --> 19:20.864
I intercepted
a Suicide Squad transmission.

19:21.034 --> 19:25.243
Flag's planning on killing someone, but
we need to decode this before he does.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.409
-Yep.
-Come on.

19:27.583 --> 19:30.450
Chloe would have this ﬁnished,
like, yesterday.

19:32.212 --> 19:36.080
Oliver, I'm trying to help you,
and you keep acting like I'm the enemy.

19:36.300 --> 19:40.259
Well, I'm just trying to get used
to all the changes around here, okay?

19:41.430 --> 19:43.887
Look, I come here,
and I think of Chloe, all right?

19:44.057 --> 19:47.766
I think of all the time that I spent here
with her, and Ijust—

19:47.936 --> 19:49.472
Just....

19:54.610 --> 19:57.773
It's hard for me being here
with someone else, okay?

19:57.946 --> 19:59.811
Okay.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.151
And I'm not trying
to take her place, Oliver.

20:03.493 --> 20:06.200
But at some point,
you need to start treating me...

20:06.371 --> 20:08.783
...like I'm on your side.

20:11.251 --> 20:13.242
[COMPUTER KEYS CLICKING]

20:20.761 --> 20:22.717
General?

20:25.057 --> 20:28.891
List completed and accounted for, sir.

20:30.020 --> 20:31.760
Clark.

20:47.621 --> 20:49.236
Have a seat, son.

21:03.220 --> 21:05.131
Let's get down to brass tacks.

21:05.305 --> 21:10.049
Lois likes to date men of action,
men who make the news.

21:10.227 --> 21:15.096
Now, you, Clark,
you just report the news.

21:15.899 --> 21:19.483
Why would she
be possibly interested in you?

21:20.279 --> 21:22.611
Why don't you ask her, sir?

21:24.741 --> 21:28.450
I asked somebody
at the Pentagon instead.

21:29.496 --> 21:32.363
Guess what he came up with.

21:32.541 --> 21:34.372
Nothing.

21:35.002 --> 21:37.584
Nobody's record's that clean.

21:37.754 --> 21:40.917
Unless they had somebody higher up
wipe it out.

21:41.383 --> 21:46.218
Somebody, let's say,
like a US. senator. Hmm?

21:47.931 --> 21:50.968
Excuse me, sir, but what gives you
the right to spy on us?

21:51.143 --> 21:53.634
Well, I'm a four-star general, Clark,
and a war hero.

21:53.812 --> 21:55.973
I know a smokescreen
when I see one.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.981
Now, nobody could've done this list
by themselves.

21:59.192 --> 22:01.683
You're searching for enemies
where they don't exist.

22:01.862 --> 22:06.322
-Just like your vigilante witch-hunt.
-l was talking about you, Clark.

22:07.284 --> 22:10.242
Why would you bring up vigilantes?

22:15.792 --> 22:19.660
Lucy found this in your loft.

22:27.596 --> 22:28.711
Huh?

22:28.889 --> 22:31.631
You're in league with them,
aren't you?

22:31.808 --> 22:33.139
I'm not on trial, Sam.

22:36.313 --> 22:39.771
You wanna protect the United States,
but as soon as you're threatened...

22:39.941 --> 22:42.227
...everyone else's rights
go out the window?

22:42.402 --> 22:44.984
No wonder Lois is too afraid
to be herself around you.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.529
You questioning my relationship
with my daughter?

22:47.699 --> 22:51.317
-You have been questioning me all day.
-lt's my right to protect my family.

22:51.495 --> 22:52.951
It may be your right...

22:54.915 --> 22:58.499
...but you're wrong
to think that we don't belong together.

22:59.252 --> 23:04.212
I love your daughter, and I don't want
a day to go by where I'm not with her.

23:06.259 --> 23:08.386
Well, I hope you enjoyed today...

23:08.553 --> 23:12.011
...because it's the last day
you'll ever spend with her.

23:29.282 --> 23:31.443
I did everything I could
to make today work.

23:32.369 --> 23:36.078
I dealt with my family, I helped the Blur,
I even found my inner Iron Chef...

23:36.248 --> 23:41.083
...and all I asked, the only thing you had
to do was deal with my dad for one day.

23:41.294 --> 23:45.128
Lois, your dad had me investigated
by the Pentagon.

23:45.882 --> 23:49.170
He has surveillance photos of me
with Kara. She's in her costume.

23:49.344 --> 23:51.676
I think your sister
planted them in the loft.

23:53.306 --> 23:57.345
I thought it would be a good idea
if we all went to your place tonight...

23:57.519 --> 23:59.510
...without Clark.

24:03.900 --> 24:06.061
I'll meet you in the car, Daddy.

24:06.820 --> 24:09.232
Thank you, sweetheart.

24:11.408 --> 24:12.989
Come on, let's go.

24:16.121 --> 24:17.827
That's an order, young lady.

24:25.505 --> 24:29.874
Can't we stay and work this out?

24:30.343 --> 24:31.924
There's nothing to work out.

24:33.388 --> 24:36.004
Your friend Clark is a dishonest man.

24:40.520 --> 24:43.808
And he has dangerous friends.

24:44.149 --> 24:47.733
And when the vigilantes try and take
over this country with anarchy...

24:47.903 --> 24:50.110
...he's gonna go down with them.

24:53.241 --> 24:55.653
So come on now. Let's go.

25:02.125 --> 25:04.411
I am sorry, Clark.

25:19.768 --> 25:22.384
The general is leaving the farm, sir.

25:22.562 --> 25:26.601
Which means Clark Kent
won't be able to Blur to his rescue.

25:29.694 --> 25:32.902
The Blur may be faster
than a speeding bullet...

25:33.073 --> 25:36.315
...but I bet he can't outrun this.

25:42.958 --> 25:46.542
Please, Dad, go back and talk to him.
It's Clark. You know him.

25:46.711 --> 25:48.372
-I can't do that, L0.
-Why?

25:48.547 --> 25:52.290
Because he's in league
with masked vigilantes.

25:52.467 --> 25:55.459
When he pays the price for this,
I do not want you to get hurt.

25:55.637 --> 25:57.502
Not all of your vigilantes are bad.

25:57.681 --> 26:01.139
Why do you have to go to DEFCON 1?
You haven't met a single one of them.

26:01.309 --> 26:05.052
Can you stop running damage control?
We are just trying to protect you.

26:05.230 --> 26:08.768
Back off, Lucy. Or do you happen to
have some compromising photos of me...

26:08.984 --> 26:10.975
...that you'd like to share
with the class?

26:11.152 --> 26:13.484
Please, both of you.

26:13.697 --> 26:17.406
Trust me, Clark is not who you think
he is. Now, a couple calls to the NSA...

26:17.576 --> 26:21.535
-...and we'll ﬁnd out what he's hiding.
-It doesn't matter, because I love Clark.

26:23.331 --> 26:26.823
Everything you need to know about him
is standing right in front of you.

26:27.002 --> 26:30.085
Talk to me.
The only thing that matters is how I feel.

26:30.255 --> 26:33.418
-Lois--
-I appreciate that you like straight talk...

26:33.592 --> 26:37.505
...so I will give it to you
in one razor-sharp line.

26:40.265 --> 26:43.883
I am staying with Clark,
and if you love me...

26:44.603 --> 26:47.345
...you will respect that.

There's only one tattooed hero
at that address.

27:58.259 --> 28:00.215
I'm the target.

28:00.387 --> 28:02.469
It doesn't make any sense.

28:02.639 --> 28:06.632
Flag would try to recruit you
before he'd try and kill you, Clark.

28:07.435 --> 28:08.595
And how can you be sure?

28:08.770 --> 28:11.011
Flag spends so much time
on the front lines...

28:11.189 --> 28:14.181
...with super-powered people,
that he identiﬁes with them.

28:14.359 --> 28:16.190
To him, you're all freedom ﬁghters...

28:16.361 --> 28:18.852
...and he would attack anyone

It's over, Flag.
We know you blew up that building.

is nothing but a weapon...

-That depends.

Look, Lucy, I'm not happy
that you went behind our backs again.

But I do get trying to protect Dad.

32:57.433 --> 32:59.810
Who wouldn't wanna do that?

-I should've told you what was going on.
-Yeah.

33:07.902 --> 33:12.441
But I thought that if I helped Dad
on my own...

33:12.615 --> 33:14.651
...he'd stop seeing me as--

33:14.867 --> 33:16.073
The troublemaker?

33:18.079 --> 33:22.163
Okay, I know I came down on you
pretty hard, Lu.

33:22.333 --> 33:25.746
But I think that a part of me
sort of liked the fact...

33:25.962 --> 33:28.419
...that you turned into
the troublemaker...

33:28.589 --> 33:31.626
...because I was ﬁnally able
to be the good one.

33:32.218 --> 33:35.927
When you say it all out loud,
it's just....

33:36.097 --> 33:38.133
Well, it sounds really exhausting.

33:39.267 --> 33:40.973
Yeah, l--

33:41.477 --> 33:45.766
I think we were so busy
trying to be the perfect daughter...

33:48.317 --> 33:50.103
...that we forgot how to be sisters.

33:50.987 --> 33:54.696
No, Lois. You're a great sister.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.717
I thought you said no happy hour.

34:16.888 --> 34:19.971
Yeah, but I'm still on the clock,
so, ha, ha....

34:22.018 --> 34:27.263
So I was curious, you hear anything
about that tattoo-removal research?

34:27.482 --> 34:29.347
I have Emil looking into it.

34:30.693 --> 34:34.436
-Okay.
-No need to worry, my friend.

34:34.655 --> 34:36.907
I think it's a little early for "friend."

34:37.075 --> 34:40.192
Friendly, I can do that. Be friendly.

34:41.871 --> 34:43.782
I'll take it.

34:46.918 --> 34:50.831
I was beginning to think
the best that I could do was frienemy.

34:51.672 --> 34:53.799
-I don't even know what that means.
-Ha.

34:54.300 --> 34:58.839
We've, uh.... We've survived tax audits
and typhoons together, Tess.

34:59.013 --> 35:01.550
I think we're practically like family
at this point.

35:04.185 --> 35:05.675
We've come a long way.

35:09.690 --> 35:12.932
From the middle of the ocean
to the top of the city.

35:14.195 --> 35:16.026
I can work with that.

35:21.119 --> 35:24.452
You know, this place is sort of like
an island, isn't it?

35:25.456 --> 35:28.072
It's just too bad
I gotta vote myself off.

35:29.627 --> 35:31.709
I don't understand.

35:34.423 --> 35:37.586
It's a funny thing about Green Arrow
showing his face to everyone.

35:37.760 --> 35:41.298
Now everyone wants to stick theirs
in my business...

35:41.472 --> 35:43.963
...and peek in my window, and....

35:46.269 --> 35:49.056
What if someone sees me come in here?
Watchtower, I mean.

35:50.481 --> 35:53.268
There are people who count on this place
remaining secret.

35:53.442 --> 35:55.899
They count on that for their safety.

35:56.737 --> 36:00.070
They didn't step out
into the limelight like I did.

36:01.450 --> 36:04.032
That wouldn't really be fair to them,
would it?

36:05.371 --> 36:08.534
After everything you've told me
about Chloe...

36:08.749 --> 36:11.491
...and what this place means to you...

36:12.461 --> 36:15.168
...that must be
a really hard decision to make.

36:21.053 --> 36:22.918
But it's the right one.

36:26.267 --> 36:28.883
Watchtower's in good hands, Tess.

36:44.785 --> 36:48.494
Clark. I owe you an apology.

36:50.958 --> 36:53.449
I'm not so set in my ways
that I can't appreciate...

36:53.628 --> 36:56.540
...the way you stood up to me earlier.

36:57.465 --> 37:01.174
And you were right,
I have not always been a perfect father.

37:01.385 --> 37:04.798
-No, sir, l--
-I needed to hear that.

37:04.972 --> 37:09.716
Nobody's had the guts to talk to me
like that since my wife passed away.

37:12.813 --> 37:14.804
You must really miss her.

37:15.316 --> 37:17.432
Every day.

37:18.569 --> 37:24.405
But, thankfully, I can see my Ella
in our daughters' faces.

37:26.702 --> 37:30.365
-Can I give you some advice, Clark?
-Yeah.

37:30.539 --> 37:31.995
Going to war...

37:32.541 --> 37:37.752
...having to deal with the rush of battle
and the struggle to save lives...

37:37.922 --> 37:43.337
...it made coming home
and doing the simple things difﬁcult.

37:44.387 --> 37:45.968
But, you know, it's funny.

37:46.138 --> 37:52.850
It's the simple things, like taking a walk
or dancing with your wife...

37:53.020 --> 37:57.514
...tucking in the kids,
that make us human.

37:59.777 --> 38:03.520
Now, don't get me wrong.
I've loved serving our country.

38:03.698 --> 38:06.861
I even got to be a hero
a couple times.

38:07.952 --> 38:10.864
But if I had to do it over again...

38:12.873 --> 38:14.864
...l'd spend more time with the family.

38:19.964 --> 38:23.206
Your girls love you, sir.
You're their hero.

38:26.679 --> 38:30.388
But I think Lois has got herself
a brand-new hero now, huh?

38:34.562 --> 38:37.395
I almost lost her tonight.

38:38.190 --> 38:41.603
But by the grace of God...

38:50.661 --> 38:53.198
And that's all thanks to the Blur, hmm?

38:57.960 --> 39:01.578
So Lois being saved by a vigilante,
that will change your mind on the bill?

39:02.423 --> 39:08.760
Well, I gotta admit, I kind of like her
having her own private guardian angel.

39:11.849 --> 39:18.345
But not every hero
has the Blur's code of honor.

39:18.522 --> 39:20.808
Not all politicians have yours.

39:22.276 --> 39:25.609
Some will use the law
to destroy people.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.941
I'm a military man, Clark.

39:28.115 --> 39:32.575
I have to believe that when push comes
to shove, America will do the right thing.

39:32.745 --> 39:35.532
Kind of like Lois
did the right thing by you tonight.

39:36.290 --> 39:40.909
For years, I've been giving her boyfriends
an impossible list of chores to do.

39:41.087 --> 39:43.169
Not to test them.

39:43.964 --> 39:45.215
To test Lois?

39:47.093 --> 39:49.926
Those poor bastards,
I put them through hell.

39:50.096 --> 39:52.758
Lois never said a thing.

39:53.349 --> 39:56.591
That's how I knew
she didn't love them.

40:03.317 --> 40:05.649
About Lois and I...

40:12.701 --> 40:15.784
...there's a question
I was hoping to ask you.

41:13.554 --> 41:16.546
No more hiding in the shadows.

41:17.308 --> 41:20.300
That's a declaration of war.

41:21.896 --> 41:23.727
Go.

42:18.786 --> 42:20.777
