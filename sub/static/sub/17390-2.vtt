WEBVTT

00:02.210 --> 00:03.872
Okay, guys. Let's hurry
up, 'cause we're running

00:03.905 --> 00:06.048
- a little bit late this morning.
- No mustard on mine.

00:06.073 --> 00:08.292
No special orders, no substitutions.

00:08.317 --> 00:10.453
This is a school lunch;
it's not supposed to be good.

00:10.478 --> 00:11.579
I'm gonna be late for work.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.416
Let's finish those lunches, huh?

00:13.448 --> 00:15.685
Okay, apple, apple,

00:15.718 --> 00:17.419
apple.

00:17.452 --> 00:19.355
Cheese, cheese, cheese.

00:19.388 --> 00:21.357
Teddy doesn't like cheese.

00:21.390 --> 00:22.490
No substitutions.

00:22.524 --> 00:24.093
All right, babies,

00:24.126 --> 00:25.327
let's go. Love you.

00:25.361 --> 00:27.696
Kiss, kiss,

00:27.730 --> 00:29.597
- kiss, squeeze.
- Ooh.

00:29.631 --> 00:30.733
How 'bout a kiss?

00:30.765 --> 00:33.169
No substitutions.

00:36.340 --> 00:39.178
Hey, there he is, Big Don.

00:39.648 --> 00:41.476
Want to guess what's in my pocket?

00:41.510 --> 00:43.801
Oh, that feels like a game
you should play with your wife,

00:43.826 --> 00:45.247
not your brother.

00:45.279 --> 00:47.215
Well, now you're making it weird.

00:47.248 --> 00:49.318
Well, I think you made it weird.

00:49.351 --> 00:51.387
Okay, forget my pocket, listen up.

00:51.419 --> 00:53.455
You know our kitchen
remodel on Broad Street?

00:53.489 --> 00:54.511
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, I helped the owner

00:54.536 --> 00:55.711
get his old T-Bird running.

00:55.736 --> 00:58.940
He was so grateful, he gave me these.

00:59.028 --> 01:00.273
Those look like Steelers tickets.

01:00.298 --> 01:02.286
Yep, they are. For this Sunday.

01:02.311 --> 01:03.647
50-yard-line seats,

01:03.672 --> 01:06.441
section 134, seats 1 and 2.

01:06.466 --> 01:07.359
That's on the aisle!

01:07.384 --> 01:08.244
I know!

01:08.269 --> 01:09.370
I'm not sure you do, Adam.

01:09.675 --> 01:12.044
When I imagine heaven, one
of the necessary elements

01:12.069 --> 01:14.004
is convenient access to a john.

01:14.108 --> 01:16.919
I don't think you're gonna
need a toilet in heaven.

01:16.944 --> 01:18.480
Okay, I don't want to get
into a religious argument

01:18.513 --> 01:19.614
with you right now.

01:19.647 --> 01:20.987
I think you're about to do

01:21.012 --> 01:22.809
something really fantastic for me.

01:22.834 --> 01:24.768
Okay, well, since
Andi went back to work,

01:24.793 --> 01:26.522
I've been really busy with kid stuff

01:26.547 --> 01:29.217
and you have really picked
up the slack around here.

01:29.272 --> 01:30.331
Hey, I'm happy to do it.

01:30.356 --> 01:33.592
Well, I want to say thank
you by taking you to the game.

01:33.743 --> 01:34.978
Oh.

01:35.003 --> 01:35.908
Oh.

01:35.933 --> 01:38.090
We've never had seats this good.

01:38.115 --> 01:39.717
You've outdone yourself, little brother.

01:39.749 --> 01:40.953
Oh, this is gonna be great.

01:40.978 --> 01:43.295
And I say, if we make
it on the kiss-cam,

01:43.320 --> 01:45.282
we go for it, give the people a show.

01:45.307 --> 01:47.321
You know, this almost makes
me regret when you were a baby,

01:47.346 --> 01:49.582
and I took you to the pound
to try to trade you for a dog.

01:50.482 --> 01:52.051
Now, why did you think that would work?

01:52.084 --> 01:53.486
You were a very hairy baby.

01:59.206 --> 02:00.650
All right, Emme,

02:00.675 --> 02:02.094
you got blackjack!

02:02.128 --> 02:05.531
That pays three cookies to two.

02:05.563 --> 02:08.199
- Gambling is the best.
- Yeah.

02:08.233 --> 02:10.002
Yeah, all right, Katie, what do you bet?

02:10.035 --> 02:11.370
I fold.

02:11.404 --> 02:13.406
Teddy ate all my chips.

02:14.673 --> 02:15.607
- Hi.
- Hey.

02:15.641 --> 02:16.213
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey, Mom.

02:16.238 --> 02:18.419
Hi, munchkins. What's going on?

02:18.444 --> 02:22.415
Daddy's teaching us blackjack
in case we need a plan B in life.

02:23.530 --> 02:25.584
All right, kiddos,
upstairs, do your homework.

02:27.320 --> 02:29.255
Huh. Look at you.

02:29.797 --> 02:31.523
We've had this seismic
shift in our life,

02:31.557 --> 02:33.125
and you're just handling it.

02:33.159 --> 02:34.626
Hmm.

02:34.660 --> 02:36.696
- You know what it makes me realize?
- What's that?

02:36.728 --> 02:38.697
How little you were doing before.

02:39.617 --> 02:41.664
Yeah, I was... I was
getting away with murder.

02:46.452 --> 02:48.441
- Hey, you know what I just realized?
- What?

02:49.288 --> 02:50.442
We're alone.

02:50.483 --> 02:52.788
Yeah, we actually get to
just hang out for a minute.

02:52.813 --> 02:55.678
- When was the last time we did that?
- We hang out.

02:55.703 --> 02:58.518
We brushed our teeth
together this morning.

02:58.562 --> 03:01.321
It was adorable.

03:01.353 --> 03:02.345
Oh, you know what I mean.

03:02.370 --> 03:04.281
I just feel like ever
since I went back to work,

03:04.694 --> 03:07.068
I'm going out one door,
you're coming in the other.

03:07.093 --> 03:10.463
I just want to make sure we
keep the romantic spark alive.

03:10.495 --> 03:12.998
Oh, I have got spark.

03:13.031 --> 03:16.501
Too much spark, according to
you, at 2:00 in the morning.

03:16.535 --> 03:18.671
- Hmm?
- Okay, but I'm talking about romance.

03:18.703 --> 03:21.073
- You know, I miss you.
- Oh.

03:21.385 --> 03:22.572
- What's this?
- What?

03:22.597 --> 03:23.432
Oh.

03:23.457 --> 03:26.511
- Oh, my God. Steelers tickets?
- Yeah.

03:26.536 --> 03:28.539
- Listen to this.
- You got these for us?

03:28.581 --> 03:30.535
Well...

03:30.560 --> 03:33.227
Because our first date
was at a Steelers game.

03:33.252 --> 03:35.989
Oh, you missed me, too.

03:37.087 --> 03:38.086
Okay, sure, but...

03:38.111 --> 03:39.375
Wait. And you remembered

03:39.400 --> 03:41.804
that Sunday is the 17th anniversary

03:41.829 --> 03:44.200
of that incredible day,
and you got us these?

03:46.220 --> 03:48.700
Apparently.

03:48.733 --> 03:51.370
Why do I ever think I have
to say anything to you?

03:51.404 --> 03:52.659
You're nothing but sparks.

03:52.684 --> 03:54.018
Yeah.

03:55.331 --> 03:57.442
Hey, do you remember
how our first date ended?

03:57.476 --> 03:58.798
Yeah, yeah, you said

03:58.823 --> 04:02.127
nice girls don't go all
the way in pickup trucks.

04:02.447 --> 04:05.350
Boy, did I misjudge you.

04:05.384 --> 04:08.286
Okay, well, um, nice girls don't,

04:08.320 --> 04:10.089
but, um, married girls do.

04:10.122 --> 04:11.491
- Mm.
- Come on.

04:12.611 --> 04:14.493
- Right now?
- Right now.

04:14.527 --> 04:17.113
- In the truck?
- In the truck.

04:17.137 --> 04:19.406
I am so glad I got us those tickets.

04:21.000 --> 04:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:32.056 --> 04:33.657
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:33.691 --> 04:35.393
Wow, it's so calm this morning.

04:35.426 --> 04:37.362
- Did you already make lunches?
- Nope.

04:37.395 --> 04:39.731
I signed them up for hot lunch.

04:39.763 --> 04:42.934
Hey, kids, I hope you like,
uh... eggplant goulash.

04:44.035 --> 04:47.938
Okay, I got to go. I
love you. I love you.

04:47.972 --> 04:51.409
I love you. Hey, follow me.

04:51.441 --> 04:53.711
After that truck thing,
I'll follow you anywhere.

04:55.641 --> 04:58.410
I just wanted to say that
yesterday was very romantic.

04:58.515 --> 05:00.652
And I'm confident I'm gonna
be feeling the same way

05:00.684 --> 05:03.721
when I get home tonight... Mr. Sparky.

05:05.267 --> 05:09.638
I'm not sure about the new
nickname, but, uh, I am in.

05:09.859 --> 05:11.429
Yeah.

05:11.898 --> 05:13.400
Hey, there you are!

05:13.425 --> 05:15.194
I got a surprise for you.

05:15.307 --> 05:16.366
Oh, are you two in the
middle of something?

05:16.400 --> 05:17.835
- Well...
- No, no.

05:17.867 --> 05:19.636
Adam was just walking me to the door

05:19.669 --> 05:22.306
because he's the most
romantic husband in the world.

05:22.340 --> 05:24.301
You would not believe what
he surprised me with. He...

05:24.326 --> 05:26.443
Okay, no time for small talk. Bye-bye!

05:27.217 --> 05:28.361
- What are you...?
- Hold on.

05:28.386 --> 05:30.889
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

05:32.616 --> 05:34.079
Okay, okay, she was
confused for a minute,

05:34.103 --> 05:35.539
- but she's leaving.
- Oh.

05:35.540 --> 05:37.388
Okay, listen, I got to talk
to you about the Steelers game.

05:37.421 --> 05:38.484
- That's why I'm here!
- Oh.

05:38.509 --> 05:39.724
Let me do mine first. It's better.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.286
I ordered us,

05:41.311 --> 05:42.510
via next day air...

05:42.535 --> 05:44.362
which you know I hate to pay for...

05:44.996 --> 05:49.368
vintage 1976 Steelers jerseys.

05:49.696 --> 05:52.398
A little thank you for
taking me to the game.

05:53.076 --> 05:55.192
Wow.

05:56.127 --> 05:57.047
Yeah.

05:57.072 --> 05:58.475
I don't know what to say.

05:59.181 --> 06:01.078
Well, I'll say it. I'm a good guy.

06:02.050 --> 06:02.879
You are.

06:02.912 --> 06:03.948
And you're a good guy, too.

06:03.980 --> 06:05.682
Eh. Not...

06:05.707 --> 06:07.609
No, no, no, no, it means a lot.

06:07.634 --> 06:10.291
We grew up watching the
Steelers. It's our thing.

06:10.316 --> 06:11.489
Is it?

06:12.281 --> 06:12.976
And is it

06:13.001 --> 06:15.003
exclusively our thing?

06:16.282 --> 06:17.215
I mean, you know,

06:17.240 --> 06:20.097
you could've easily invited
Andi, but who'd you pick?

06:21.021 --> 06:22.556
- Me.
- Mm.

06:23.134 --> 06:25.292
You know, I'm not much for
physical displays of affection,

06:25.317 --> 06:28.222
- but I'm gonna give you one of these.
- Well...

06:31.544 --> 06:33.143
Wow. Three pats?

06:33.176 --> 06:35.979
That's two more than my wedding day.

06:36.013 --> 06:37.849
Don't tell the guys at work about this.

06:37.881 --> 06:39.327
I don't want them to think I'm a sissy.

06:39.352 --> 06:40.887
Oh...

06:41.684 --> 06:42.649
- Bye, Dad!
- Bye, Dad!

06:42.673 --> 06:43.486
Bye!

06:43.487 --> 06:45.056
Uh...

06:45.422 --> 06:47.691
Hmm. Where are you going, Mr. Burns?

06:47.725 --> 06:49.926
There's a parent education
seminar this morning.

06:49.960 --> 06:51.829
Oh, well, listen, not only do I have

06:51.862 --> 06:53.864
a pressing family
situation I need to handle,

06:53.898 --> 06:55.934
I don't want to go to that.

07:01.583 --> 07:03.607
So, what, are you
just gonna stare at me?

07:04.980 --> 07:06.650
You think that's gonna intimidate me?

07:10.658 --> 07:12.912
Well, we'll find out after the seminar.

07:13.996 --> 07:15.432
Adam! Adam!

07:15.457 --> 07:17.959
I saved you a seat. Right here. Adam.

07:19.193 --> 07:20.056
Hey, Marie.

07:20.090 --> 07:21.963
I don't know if you heard,
but Lowell saved you a seat.

07:21.988 --> 07:24.429
Yeah. Thanks.

07:24.879 --> 07:26.134
Welcome parents.

07:26.159 --> 07:29.664
Today's topic will be: "How
to stop playground bullying."

07:29.766 --> 07:32.223
Before we begin, I'd like to apologize

07:32.248 --> 07:33.745
for the lack of refreshments.

07:33.770 --> 07:35.475
If you have any
complaints, please feel free

07:35.500 --> 07:37.801
to direct them to your
room parent, Mr. Burns.

07:40.395 --> 07:41.845
Okay, I got a question.

07:41.878 --> 07:42.796
All right?

07:42.821 --> 07:44.798
What has happened in society

07:44.869 --> 07:47.578
that we can't go 30
minutes without a water?

07:47.603 --> 07:48.348
Huh?

07:48.373 --> 07:49.363
We don't need water.

07:49.388 --> 07:52.157
What we need is a way
to tunnel out of here!

07:53.148 --> 07:54.025
You done, Mr. Burns?

07:55.098 --> 07:56.540
Yeah, I've said my piece.

07:58.322 --> 08:00.524
So as you continue to workshop scenarios

08:00.549 --> 08:03.586
in your smaller groups,
remember the watch word

08:03.619 --> 08:05.554
for when your child feels bullied:

08:05.586 --> 08:08.490
"Stand up, Talk, Depart."

08:08.523 --> 08:10.559
STD.

08:12.927 --> 08:14.429
All right?

08:21.035 --> 08:22.971
Let's just call it
"Stand up, Talk, Depart."

08:24.605 --> 08:27.543
Yeah, bullying is the worst.

08:28.472 --> 08:29.974
Okay, so now I got two people

08:29.999 --> 08:32.102
who think they're going
to the game with me.

08:32.128 --> 08:34.369
If they run into each other
again, this whole thing

08:34.394 --> 08:35.599
is gonna blow up in my face...

08:35.624 --> 08:37.580
said that bully to me.

08:39.991 --> 08:41.655
You know you got to take
your wife to the game.

08:41.690 --> 08:44.694
I fed my kids Chips Ahoy! for
breakfast, and even I know that.

08:44.726 --> 08:46.928
No. I know, I know.

08:47.506 --> 08:49.865
Now I just got to get to
work and break it to Don.

08:50.701 --> 08:52.356
Question is: how do I get out of here?

08:52.381 --> 08:53.527
This is tough.

08:53.552 --> 08:55.409
I mean, if it were
me, I would ask myself,

08:55.434 --> 08:58.404
"What would Adam do?" but you're Adam.

08:59.083 --> 09:00.738
And you don't know.

09:02.238 --> 09:04.347
It might be unknowable.

09:05.079 --> 09:06.682
You guys are so cute together.

09:08.176 --> 09:10.567
Marie, it doesn't sound
like you're talking about

09:10.592 --> 09:12.159
what you're supposed
to be talking about.

09:12.184 --> 09:14.286
Excuse, Mrs. Rodriguez.

09:15.018 --> 09:17.655
I think you're bullying my good friend.

09:18.527 --> 09:21.489
So I will stand up...

09:22.381 --> 09:25.746
talk... and depart.

09:31.102 --> 09:33.239
That's right... I just gave you an STD.

09:41.259 --> 09:43.294
- Andi.
- Hey.

09:43.319 --> 09:45.389
And Don.

09:45.991 --> 09:48.194
What a heart-stopping surprise.

09:49.074 --> 09:51.284
What are you two unlikely buddies up to?

09:51.309 --> 09:52.861
Oh, just gabbing...

09:53.081 --> 09:55.083
about you taking Andi
to the Steelers game.

09:55.526 --> 09:57.065
What a lucky girl.

09:57.099 --> 09:59.735
I sure wish someone would
invite me to a Steelers game.

10:00.201 --> 10:01.870
You know, it's strange.
I wish it so much it,

10:02.535 --> 10:05.473
it seems like it actually happened.

10:06.054 --> 10:07.443
I just wanted to bring

10:07.468 --> 10:10.671
my romantic husband a romantic
sausage and pepper for lunch.

10:11.331 --> 10:14.082
Oh. So you're still happy with me?

10:14.587 --> 10:16.552
- Um, I brought you a sausage and pepper.
- Oh.

10:16.585 --> 10:18.788
Okay, I got to get back to the hospital.

10:18.813 --> 10:19.526
Everybody thinks

10:19.551 --> 10:21.364
- I'm in the bathroom, so...
- Oh.

10:22.197 --> 10:23.023
Love you.

10:23.048 --> 10:24.093
Okay. Love you, too.

10:24.125 --> 10:25.520
You're the best wife ever!

10:25.545 --> 10:28.148
You remember that if
something should come up later.

10:33.028 --> 10:34.503
You want my sandwich?

10:34.536 --> 10:36.739
Not even sausage can fix this.

10:37.472 --> 10:39.774
I'm still taking it.

10:39.807 --> 10:42.315
I'm sorry. And thanks
for not telling Andi

10:42.340 --> 10:44.078
I invited you to the game first.

10:44.111 --> 10:45.279
It's called loyalty.

10:45.538 --> 10:48.309
Something you should have a
little less of with your wife.

10:49.100 --> 10:50.927
But this is just a small obstacle.

10:50.952 --> 10:53.188
We can still save this;
just make up a reason

10:53.221 --> 10:55.634
why I have to go to
the game instead of her.

10:55.659 --> 10:57.066
I don't want to lie to my wife.

10:57.091 --> 10:59.156
I did it once already;
that's bad enough.

10:59.181 --> 11:00.996
Eh, that's where you're wrong.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.633
Once you lie to your wife,

11:02.658 --> 11:04.528
the only way out is to double down.

11:05.592 --> 11:07.528
Like with me and Marcy...
if I have to lie to her,

11:07.553 --> 11:08.934
I don't stop at just one.

11:08.959 --> 11:11.595
I layer it... lie upon lie.

11:11.706 --> 11:14.943
Like a delicious lasagna of deception.

11:15.395 --> 11:17.231
All right, look, Andi thinks

11:17.256 --> 11:18.899
we don't spend enough
time together, okay?

11:18.924 --> 11:20.810
She saw the tickets,
she got all excited.

11:20.835 --> 11:22.750
I had no choice. I had to invite her.

11:23.251 --> 11:24.534
You know, I'd hate to bring up the fact

11:24.559 --> 11:26.028
that while you've been
off making cupcakes

11:26.053 --> 11:28.165
for kindergarten, I've
had your back here.

11:28.190 --> 11:30.626
I don't think you hated
to bring that up at all.

11:31.148 --> 11:32.894
You're right. I loved it.

11:32.927 --> 11:35.998
Okay... bottom line, I'm taking Andi.

11:37.416 --> 11:39.647
Okay. I guess that's par for the course.

11:41.138 --> 11:43.196
- What does that mean?
- It's a golf expression.

11:43.221 --> 11:45.206
That means it's normal
for you to screw me over.

11:45.240 --> 11:48.583
Oh. Come on, Don, it's just one game.

11:48.608 --> 11:49.912
We'll go to another game.

11:49.945 --> 11:52.155
It's more than one game; it's a pattern.

11:52.180 --> 11:53.782
It's like when Andi went back to work.

11:53.815 --> 11:56.041
You changed everything up.
You're hardly ever here.

11:56.066 --> 11:58.150
You didn't even think about
how it would affect me.

11:58.175 --> 12:00.263
You said you were happy to do it.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.964
Because you were giving
me Steelers tickets.

12:03.658 --> 12:04.860
Okay, you know what?

12:05.608 --> 12:06.536
Don't call me anymore.

12:06.561 --> 12:07.470
I'm blocking your number.

12:07.495 --> 12:08.455
Well...

12:08.480 --> 12:10.416
we run a business together.

12:10.441 --> 12:12.543
Then I'll block it after business hours.

12:12.834 --> 12:15.912
All right, so... so you're
gonna unblock me every morning,

12:15.937 --> 12:18.139
and then block me again every night?

12:18.763 --> 12:21.610
Yes. I will learn how to block calls.

12:22.049 --> 12:24.812
And do it twice daily for
the foreseeable future.

12:25.017 --> 12:26.929
That's how angry I am.

12:34.344 --> 12:36.343
Okay, kids are all dropped
off at their playdates.

12:36.368 --> 12:37.313
Let's go to the game.

12:37.346 --> 12:39.801
Hey, why aren't you
wearing your Steelers jersey

12:39.826 --> 12:41.676
that you never wash
because it "totally affects

12:41.701 --> 12:43.187
the outcome of the game"?

12:44.340 --> 12:45.840
Uh...

12:45.865 --> 12:47.680
listen, honey, I got
to tell you something,

12:47.705 --> 12:49.393
and it might make you mad, but...

12:50.693 --> 12:53.079
I think I got to take Don to the game.

12:53.104 --> 12:54.638
What? Why?

12:54.663 --> 12:57.311
Well, he hasn't talked
to me in three days.

12:57.336 --> 12:59.483
He's all bent out of shape
because of all the extra stuff

12:59.508 --> 13:01.251
he's been doing for me
since you went back to work,

13:01.276 --> 13:04.292
and I think... I think
if I take him to the game,

13:04.317 --> 13:05.586
he might forgive me.

13:06.334 --> 13:07.644
You know what? Maybe you're right.

13:07.669 --> 13:10.058
Now, hold on, just
hear me out. I... wait.

13:10.753 --> 13:12.076
What did you say?

13:12.101 --> 13:14.678
Well, we never thought about
how this would affect him.

13:14.703 --> 13:16.474
We just went off and did it. So...

13:17.264 --> 13:19.533
yeah, you should take him to the game.

13:22.167 --> 13:23.772
So just to be clear...

13:27.033 --> 13:30.259
I go to the game with Don,
and he's not mad at me anymore;

13:30.563 --> 13:34.488
you don't go to the game,
and you're also not mad at me?

13:34.513 --> 13:36.416
Right.

13:40.776 --> 13:42.051
And I'm not dreaming?

13:42.745 --> 13:43.992
Oh, honey, I can't believe

13:44.017 --> 13:46.023
you've been carrying
this around so long.

13:46.048 --> 13:47.594
You know that if we're
honest with each other,

13:47.619 --> 13:49.288
we can just work this stuff out.

13:49.793 --> 13:51.429
Yeah.

13:52.421 --> 13:53.556
You're right.

13:53.603 --> 13:54.515
I do feel better.

13:54.540 --> 13:55.725
Good.

13:56.455 --> 14:00.069
But there is one tiny
thing I haven't mentioned.

14:01.446 --> 14:03.765
Babe... you were thoughtful enough

14:03.790 --> 14:06.502
to buy us Steelers tickets
for our anniversary.

14:06.527 --> 14:08.529
Right?

14:08.562 --> 14:10.832
Nothing you say can ruin that.

14:21.029 --> 14:23.019
You know what, maybe it can
wait till after the game.

14:23.618 --> 14:25.663
Are you sure? It might
feel better to say it now.

14:25.688 --> 14:27.648
- I don't think so.
- Okay.

14:27.673 --> 14:29.339
Well, this is actually good.

14:29.364 --> 14:31.378
I mean, the kids need
new clothes, and...

14:31.403 --> 14:34.664
since I went back to work, I
kind of miss buying tiny shoes.

14:35.320 --> 14:37.255
- All right, well, go call Don.
- I can't.

14:37.280 --> 14:39.082
I'll have to go over there.

14:39.114 --> 14:40.383
He blocked my number!

14:44.397 --> 14:46.133
Oh, hey, Marcy. I'm looking for Don.

14:46.158 --> 14:47.958
I'm taking him to the
Steelers game. Where is he?

14:47.991 --> 14:50.060
Oh, he's supposedly at
a Steelers game with you.

14:50.093 --> 14:52.118
He left an hour ago, said
you guys were tailgating,

14:52.143 --> 14:54.812
but, um... you're not there.

14:56.516 --> 14:57.367
Okay, good-bye.

14:57.400 --> 14:58.568
Whoa, whoa.

14:58.600 --> 15:01.470
Hold on a second.

15:01.503 --> 15:03.339
Why aren't you at the game?

15:04.291 --> 15:05.447
W-We are.

15:06.076 --> 15:07.244
Well, Don is.

15:07.807 --> 15:09.112
But we forgot charcoal.

15:09.145 --> 15:10.314
So I left Don

15:10.347 --> 15:13.050
at the stadium, and I
came here to get some.

15:13.442 --> 15:15.052
But that was dumb.

15:15.383 --> 15:16.719
What are you doing?

15:17.151 --> 15:19.554
Just regretting certain choices.

15:20.290 --> 15:22.159
Like coming here.

15:22.435 --> 15:23.747
You look great, by the way.

15:23.848 --> 15:26.217
Those angry lines in your
forehead, very becoming.

15:26.421 --> 15:27.658
- Okay, good-bye.
- Oh.

15:30.300 --> 15:32.863
Don! There you are.

15:32.888 --> 15:34.790
You got to unblock me.

15:36.116 --> 15:37.698
Okay, I'm gonna say this fast.

15:37.723 --> 15:39.476
Andi said I could take you to the game.

15:39.508 --> 15:41.421
- What?!
- Yeah. So let's get going.

15:41.446 --> 15:43.546
I'll tell you the part you
might not like in the car.

15:43.579 --> 15:45.581
Okay. Oh, oh-oh.

15:47.740 --> 15:48.618
Hey, Marcy.

15:48.651 --> 15:50.155
Yeah, I'm here at the game with Adam.

15:50.180 --> 15:52.149
Say "charcoal," say "charcoal"!

15:52.254 --> 15:54.090
He came over to the house?

15:54.533 --> 15:56.292
Charcoal. Charcoal!

15:56.325 --> 15:57.293
Oh...

15:57.326 --> 15:58.466
oh, oh, is that right, Marcy?

15:58.491 --> 16:00.462
You think I'm lying? Prove it.

16:03.168 --> 16:04.635
Hello, Don.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.608
She tailed you.

16:13.781 --> 16:15.511
Sloppy.

16:15.785 --> 16:17.399
Sloppy Adam.

16:21.417 --> 16:23.786
Why do you have to lie, Don?

16:23.820 --> 16:26.390
Okay, yes, I've made
mistakes in the past,

16:26.422 --> 16:29.125
but the fact is, today
is all Adam's fault.

16:29.158 --> 16:31.988
- Come on, man!
- See, I had to lie to you,

16:32.013 --> 16:33.192
because Adam lied to Andi,

16:33.217 --> 16:36.053
so I had to cover for him
to protect my baby brother.

16:36.964 --> 16:38.965
So you started this?

16:42.147 --> 16:43.138
You know, I always thought

16:43.163 --> 16:45.867
you were the good brother,
the honest, dependable one.

16:45.892 --> 16:49.212
A little boring, yes, but at
least you could be trusted.

16:49.244 --> 16:50.943
What do you have to say for yourself?

16:50.968 --> 16:52.841
Well, I... w-we...

16:52.866 --> 16:56.337
Does this pivot around
back to you at some point?

16:58.842 --> 17:00.511
What's this? Hey, Marcy.

17:01.295 --> 17:02.812
Why aren't you guys at the game?

17:02.876 --> 17:03.910
She's right. Adam, we should go.

17:03.935 --> 17:05.704
- Sit down.
- Good idea, baby.

17:07.597 --> 17:10.067
So, do you want to
tell her, or should I?

17:12.657 --> 17:14.660
I-I...

17:15.202 --> 17:17.570
Okay, look, honey...

17:17.705 --> 17:20.608
the Steelers tickets were from a client.

17:20.964 --> 17:23.814
And I didn't remember our
first date anniversary thing,

17:23.847 --> 17:25.665
but... you were so excited,

17:25.690 --> 17:27.693
I... I couldn't tell you about it.

17:28.102 --> 17:30.543
So I... I built one of Don's

17:30.568 --> 17:33.405
stupid lasagnas of deception!

17:35.324 --> 17:37.593
Okay, so not one thing you said all week

17:37.627 --> 17:39.663
about this game has been the truth?

17:40.402 --> 17:42.698
Well, there is a game today.

17:42.732 --> 17:44.174
Really? That's what you're going with?

17:44.199 --> 17:45.748
I don't know. How do you live like this?

17:45.773 --> 17:47.642
It doesn't work at all!

17:48.446 --> 17:49.851
You don't have enough layers.

17:49.876 --> 17:53.013
Nobody likes a one-layer lasagna.

17:53.185 --> 17:54.931
Okay, fine, you know what, I screwed up.

17:54.956 --> 17:56.888
All right? I got tickets
on the 50-yard line!

17:56.913 --> 17:58.815
One of the best things
that's every happened to me.

17:58.848 --> 18:00.884
And I wanted to take my
brother, 'cause I love him

18:00.916 --> 18:02.197
and I wanted to make him happy.

18:02.222 --> 18:03.815
And I wanted to take my wife,

18:03.840 --> 18:06.624
'cause I love her, and I
wanted to make her happy.

18:07.053 --> 18:08.550
I wanted to make everybody happy.

18:08.575 --> 18:10.900
Now nobody's happy. So you know what?

18:10.925 --> 18:12.498
These tickets are a curse.

18:12.523 --> 18:13.460
I don't even want them anymore.

18:13.485 --> 18:14.987
Take 'em!

18:15.465 --> 18:16.936
No, not you.

18:16.961 --> 18:18.496
You called me boring.

18:20.636 --> 18:22.218
But why couldn't you
have just been honest

18:22.243 --> 18:24.346
with me in the first place?

18:24.474 --> 18:26.342
That is a good question.

18:28.395 --> 18:29.806
I should have been honest.

18:29.831 --> 18:31.442
- I'm sorry.
- Listen,

18:31.467 --> 18:33.336
when we decided I was
gonna go back to work,

18:33.361 --> 18:35.665
we didn't take into account
all the people it would affect.

18:35.690 --> 18:37.780
You know? So... Don,

18:38.193 --> 18:40.863
thank you for helping Adam out.

18:46.222 --> 18:47.502
And, Adam, you know,

18:47.527 --> 18:49.456
keeping the spark alive,
it's not all on you.

18:49.481 --> 18:51.584
I didn't mean to put
all the pressure on you.

18:51.768 --> 18:54.023
Oh. So do you forgive me?

18:54.048 --> 18:55.050
Yeah.

18:55.609 --> 18:57.773
- Do you forgive me?
- Keep dreaming.

19:01.377 --> 19:03.095
Okay, so who gets to go to the game?

19:03.120 --> 19:05.711
Oh, honey, I don't think
there's any question about that.

19:05.736 --> 19:07.145
Oh, babe, you're the best.

19:07.170 --> 19:09.038
Yeah, Marcy and I are going.

19:10.422 --> 19:12.056
You lied; you lose.

19:12.081 --> 19:14.083
Marcy, let's hit it.

19:16.768 --> 19:18.604
Enjoy your lasagna.

19:23.358 --> 19:25.695
Oh. Pause the game. There I am!

19:28.197 --> 19:29.766
That is you.

19:30.974 --> 19:32.659
Man, those are some good seats.

19:32.684 --> 19:34.939
They were. Would've been better, though,

19:34.964 --> 19:36.168
if you were there with me.

19:36.193 --> 19:38.296
That's what I would've said
if I'd have gone without you.

19:39.361 --> 19:41.674
Hey, tell you what, next
year, for our 19th...

19:41.699 --> 19:43.665
- 18th.
- 18th first date anniversary,

19:43.690 --> 19:45.191
- Mm-hmm?
- we'll go together.

19:45.528 --> 19:46.348
That'd be nice.

19:46.373 --> 19:47.427
Yeah.

19:50.278 --> 19:53.382
Hey, I do remember one
thing about our first date.

19:53.438 --> 19:54.841
- Hmm?
- After the game,

19:55.006 --> 19:56.474
I told Don I had just gone out

19:56.499 --> 19:58.968
with the girl that I was gonna marry.

19:59.106 --> 20:00.942
Aw.

20:01.146 --> 20:03.649
I told my girlfriend
you needed a haircut.

20:04.985 --> 20:06.120
That's okay.

20:06.192 --> 20:08.164
I also told Don we did it in my truck.

20:17.796 --> 20:20.200
What did I do now?

20:20.232 --> 20:23.874
This time it wasn't you,
it was your daughter.

20:23.899 --> 20:26.669
What do you know about
Cookie Blackjack, Mr. Burns?

20:29.061 --> 20:31.111
Never heard of her.

20:31.143 --> 20:32.967
The game, Mr. Burns.

20:32.992 --> 20:35.662
Your daughter won all her
friends' lunches at cards.

20:41.365 --> 20:44.373
Hey, you teach book smarts,
I teach street smarts.
