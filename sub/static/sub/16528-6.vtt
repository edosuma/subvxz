00:09.477 --> 00:12.378

    into a mirror!

00:12.847 --> 00:14.480
 (AS ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER)
 I'll be back.

00:14.482 --> 00:15.981

     mister.

            get it off.

00:18.986 --> 00:20.419
   No! I'm Commando.

00:20.421 --> 00:21.120
                  Commando?
                  No, no, no.

00:21.122 --> 00:24.390

00:33.701 --> 00:35.834
 Schwarzenegger really is
 the coolest man alive.

00:35.836 --> 00:39.405
   And his acting gets slightly
   better in every movie.

00:39.407 --> 00:42.041
           Hoo-hoo!
           Look at Commando go!

00:42.043 --> 00:43.475
                He just punched
                that guy dead!

         Don't go in that shed!

00:50.618 --> 00:52.117
                 Adam, Commando
                 won't listen!

00:52.119 --> 00:53.552
    (WHISPERING)
    You know who is listening?

00:53.554 --> 00:54.553
 (NORMAL VOICE)
 The entire theater!

00:56.624 --> 01:00.926

 Or <i> Rambo.</i>

01:07.935 --> 01:11.470
 Or any action movie

  Are you thinking
  what I'm thinking?

01:17.912 --> 01:19.711
          Arnold said six lines
          in that movie

01:19.713 --> 01:20.979
         and your dad
         talked over every one?

01:20.981 --> 01:22.748
 No! This is my big ticket
 to get him

01:22.750 --> 01:25.617
 to finally pony up some dough
 for a homemade action movie!

01:25.619 --> 01:27.553
             Dude, when are you
             gonna learn?
         What?

01:27.555 --> 01:29.021
           It's like every week
           you go to your dad

01:29.023 --> 01:31.890
        and ask him to support
        one of your insanely
        geeky hobbies.

 "Weird Science" up a hot girl.

  Dave Kim!

01:41.168 --> 01:42.301
 But this time's
 gonna be different

01:42.303 --> 01:45.704
 'cause for the first time,
 we love the same thing.

 He can't say no!

01:46.607 --> 01:48.707
              And yet, I think
              he'll find a way.

01:48.709 --> 01:52.711
  ADULT ADAM: <i> And so began the</i>
 <i> presentation of a lifetime.</i>

        Evening, dad.
        Full disclosure.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.081
        I'm gonna do that thing
        where I present you

01:56.083 --> 01:57.816

        and ask you to fund it.

 Kiddo, please don't put us all
 through this again.

02:01.255 --> 02:02.688

02:02.690 --> 02:03.455
          Not this time!

02:03.457 --> 02:05.457
         I've decided to make
         my first action movie.

02:05.459 --> 02:08.759
      And I need you to help me
      realize my vision.

02:10.231 --> 02:12.664
            It's called
           <i> Recipe for Death.</i>

02:12.666 --> 02:13.232
        I'm in.

02:13.234 --> 02:15.534
       I play John Cook,
       the street-wise chef

02:15.536 --> 02:17.736
 whose brother was kidnapped
 by the Mafia.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.304
 Now the only thing I serve

02:19.306 --> 02:20.739
              is vengeance.
 I'm in.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.608
        Let me finish
        before you mock me.

02:22.610 --> 02:26.478
 My movie stars the world's
 biggest, baddest action hero.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.347
    He's not from Austria,
    like Arnold,

02:28.349 --> 02:29.882
 or Belgium, like Van Damme,

02:29.884 --> 02:31.617
   or wherever Steven Seagal
   is from.

02:31.619 --> 02:32.951
   Probably central Florida.

02:32.953 --> 02:36.455

 lives in our house!

 just let the poor yutz finish.

 don't you get?

<i> fashion.</i>

03:23.837 --> 03:27.239
  Seriously! That dress could
  literally not get any radder.

03:27.241 --> 03:28.473
 It's a sweater dress
 from Benetton.

03:28.475 --> 03:31.643
  They can take even the lamest
  and lumpiest of all clothes

03:31.645 --> 03:32.578
             and make it
             sleek and sexy.

03:32.580 --> 03:35.347
 Well, Benetton is
 the Italian word for "style."

03:35.349 --> 03:35.681
                   I agree.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.416
 It's the perfect dress
 for our homecoming party.

03:37.418 --> 03:39.251
 Me and Barry are
 gonna look so classy.

03:39.253 --> 03:41.720
    God! I want a sweater dress
    so bad.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.322
      I wish I could afford it.
 Maybe you can get a job.

03:43.324 --> 03:46.158
         And maybe you can try
         and help me instead of
         talking nonsense.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.960
 Well, then just ask your mom
 to buy it for you.

03:47.962 --> 03:50.362
      No way! Shopping with her
      is a nightmare.

03:50.364 --> 03:53.265
         She always turns it
         into a daylong bonding
         marathon

03:53.267 --> 03:57.469
  with brunch and mani-pedis
  and ice cream and long talks.

03:57.471 --> 04:00.205

04:00.207 --> 04:01.073
            Ugh! I know, right?

04:01.075 --> 04:03.542
 Well, the question
 you have to ask yourself

04:03.544 --> 04:05.110
 is how bad do you want
 that sweater dress?

04:05.112 --> 04:08.880

          I was just thinking
          about that.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.624
 Anyway. Can we go shopping
 for a dress?

04:18.625 --> 04:23.729

    Oh!

04:30.804 --> 04:34.539
     I just had to capture the
     moment so I could remember
     it forever.

04:34.541 --> 04:37.776
    The moment when my daughter
    became my best friend.

04:37.778 --> 04:38.977
   So that's a yes?

04:38.979 --> 04:40.612
                Heck, yes!
                Grab your coat!

             Look out, Gimbels!
             The Goldberg gals
             are coming in hot!

04:43.817 --> 04:45.951
 Actually, I was thinking
 a different store.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.586
        Oh, but everybody loves
        Gimbels.

    Yeah, it's like
    traveling back

04:49.023 --> 04:51.390

 less-fashionable era.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.191
 I was thinking
 more Benetton.

04:53.193 --> 04:53.792
                   Ooh, yes.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.028
      That's the place
      where you order the meats

04:56.030 --> 04:57.396
        and they cook them
        right there next to you

04:57.398 --> 04:59.097
   and then they flip the meats
   into your mouth

04:59.099 --> 05:00.132
              and then you eat
              the meats.

05:00.134 --> 05:01.533
      That's Benihana.
              Okay, then.

05:01.535 --> 05:04.369
           So, Gimbels first,
           then flying meats,

05:04.371 --> 05:06.405
    then we get our nails done,
    then a sherbet stop,

05:06.407 --> 05:08.140
       then I gotta pick up
       your dad's prescription,

05:08.142 --> 05:11.009
            then paddle boating
            in the park,
            and then who knows?

       or Circuit City.

05:42.443 --> 05:43.575
 Give them their decency!

05:43.577 --> 05:46.445
 They need bulky khakis
 and nylon blouses!

         Yah!

06:32.393 --> 06:33.925
            (GUNSHOT)

06:34.228 --> 06:35.460
            (GUNSHOT)

06:35.462 --> 06:37.696
                   Cool, right?
              Uh-huh, uh-huh.

06:37.698 --> 06:38.897
      Lots of good stuff there.

06:38.899 --> 06:42.000
        Dad, you're actually
        interested in my movie!

06:42.002 --> 06:43.068
          I want your feedback.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.170
        Good or bad?
        We're partners on this.

06:45.172 --> 06:47.839
      Partners?
      Okay then.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.274
 Well, it's all dark
 and hard to see.

06:49.276 --> 06:51.243
       There were some lighting
       challenges. Note taken.

06:51.245 --> 06:53.011
  And the camera
  shakes like crazy.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.246
    Camera's kinda heavy, so...

06:54.248 --> 06:55.680
 Also, it sounds like crap.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.082
           Wow. Lotta thoughts.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.750
         And it looks
         cheap as hell.

06:58.752 --> 06:59.518
                All right,
                maybe ease off.

06:59.520 --> 07:03.522
 Like a washed-out,
 crummy public-access show
 that's on at midnight.

07:03.524 --> 07:04.222
                I'm just a boy!

07:04.224 --> 07:06.491
 I gave you $80
 to make a real movie.

07:06.493 --> 07:08.827
 You said you were gonna do
 some real "Van Damage."

07:08.829 --> 07:12.731
        Look, a film camera
        and lights and boom mic
        cost a ton of money.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.399
         It's not just going to
         fall in my lap.

07:14.401 --> 07:16.802
   Here's the stuff.
   Make it good.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.069
        Wow.
        Where'd you score this?

07:18.071 --> 07:21.840
 My cousin Russ films
 bar mitzvahs for a living.
 He said you could borrow it.

07:21.842 --> 07:24.309
                Whoa. Wait.
                All this time,
                I've had access

07:24.311 --> 07:27.712
      to high-tech Hollywood
      film equipment,
      and you've never told me?

07:27.714 --> 07:29.681
 I guess I never connected
 the dots.

07:29.683 --> 07:30.549
                  Oh, my God.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.517
               There's, like,
               a warm sensation
               inside my heart.

07:32.519 --> 07:35.387
 Don't make it weird.
       It's like you're one of
       those dads in the stands

07:35.389 --> 07:38.290
     cheering me on 'cause
     I'm good at athletic-sport
     competitions.

07:38.292 --> 07:41.293
 You made it weird.
 Now, just take the
 stuff and go.

07:41.295 --> 07:42.427
           Now that
           I'm a real director,

07:42.429 --> 07:44.129
      I've gotta write a script
      and hire a crew...

07:44.131 --> 07:48.900
 And hire your leading man?
 You've come to the
 right place.

07:48.902 --> 07:49.935
    And I accept your offer.

07:49.937 --> 07:52.337
 We didn't come to you,
 and there's no offer.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.206
               Wait! Maybe this
               is the one time

07:54.208 --> 07:55.874
          Barry would
          actually be helpful.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.742
    This is the one time, bro!

07:57.744 --> 08:00.278
      I've extensively studied
      the work of Chuck Norris

08:00.280 --> 08:03.715
 and know what it takes to be
 a badass action star.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.016
          Karate!

08:05.786 --> 08:06.918
                Stunts!

08:06.920 --> 08:07.886
          (GROANS)

08:07.888 --> 08:10.989
         Acting.
         Surprise! Anger!

08:10.991 --> 08:12.724
        Surprise! Anger!

08:12.726 --> 08:14.659
       And most important,
       love scene.

08:14.661 --> 08:17.095
      No. Please don't show us
      love scene.

08:18.932 --> 08:19.898
                Oh, sweet Lord.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.032
 He's never getting married.

08:21.034 --> 08:24.236
 Adam, a word.
 Are you serious about this?

08:24.238 --> 08:25.170
 The guy's a moron.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.638
                 He's your son.
  That's how I know!

08:26.640 --> 08:28.573
      Trust me.
      Barry's gonna be amazing.

08:28.575 --> 08:31.910
              Also, I have
              no other options.
 So do I have the part?

08:31.912 --> 08:32.409
          No.
                      Yes.

08:32.412 --> 08:34.546
  I see what's happening.
  You're negotiating.

08:34.548 --> 08:37.082
 I will reduce my normal fee
 of $1 million

08:37.083 --> 08:40.085
 and will work for free.
 No, wait. $1,000!

08:40.087 --> 08:41.986
     No. I'll pay you!

08:41.989 --> 08:43.421
      Damn it. I blew it.

08:43.423 --> 08:45.891
  ADULT ADAM: <i> While Barry was</i>
 <i> preparing for his new role,</i>

08:45.893 --> 08:48.593
<i> my mom wasn't at all prepared</i>
<i> for Benetton.</i>

08:48.595 --> 08:50.762
 Welcome to the future
 of clothing.

08:50.764 --> 08:53.298
 The United Colors
 of Benetton.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.368
           It's very bright
           and it smells weird.

08:56.370 --> 08:59.104
 Forget Gimbels.
 This will be just as fun.

08:59.106 --> 09:02.641
 Hey. What's the one thing
 you love doing most
 when we go shopping?

09:02.643 --> 09:05.443
          Nodding yes or no
          as you try on outfits

09:05.445 --> 09:06.478
              like they do
              in the movies.

09:06.480 --> 09:08.246
 Well, then get ready
 to nod yes

09:08.248 --> 09:10.782
 because we have
 some shopping to do.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.586
             <i> � Ow</i>

09:18.325 --> 09:19.891
        <i> � Yeah, yeah �</i>

09:19.893 --> 09:20.559
                    Uh-uh.

09:20.561 --> 09:24.496
      <i> � I used to think</i>
      <i> maybe you loved me</i>

09:24.498 --> 09:26.998
   <i> � Now, baby, I'm sure �</i>

09:28.835 --> 09:30.368
          (MUSIC CUTS)
   Stop shaking no.

09:30.370 --> 09:32.170
     I need a yes.
     Shake yes!

09:32.172 --> 09:33.705
             I can't shake yes!

09:33.707 --> 09:35.040
       Just try!

09:39.246 --> 09:42.681
          It won't do it.
          My neck loves Gimbels
          too much.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.449
 Well, I don't care
 about your stupid neck

09:44.451 --> 09:46.918
 as long as your credit card
 is nodding.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.186
                  I'm trying!

09:48.188 --> 09:50.188
       (SIGHS) Perhaps a dollop
       of tuna salad

09:50.190 --> 09:53.191
         from the Benetton cafe
         will calm my nerves.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.492
   There is no cafe.

09:54.494 --> 09:56.394
                Oh (BLEEP) no!

09:56.396 --> 09:57.829
             I will find tuna.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.464
          Give me (BLEEP) tuna!

09:59.466 --> 10:02.601
            What kind of store
            doesn't have tuna?

10:04.338 --> 10:06.237
  ADULT ADAM: <i> It was the morning</i>
<i> of the shoot,</i>

10:06.239 --> 10:07.739
     <i> and while my star</i>
     <i> was ready to shine,</i>

10:07.741 --> 10:09.474
      <i> my dad was ready</i>
      <i> to pull the plug.</i>

10:09.476 --> 10:12.811
          And the Oscar for
          Best Actor goes to...

10:13.213 --> 10:15.447
    Barry Norman Goldberg!

10:15.449 --> 10:17.816
   A lot of other actors
   would say, "Thank you."

10:17.818 --> 10:19.217
    I'm saying,
    "You're welcome."

10:19.219 --> 10:20.652
     Hey, Barry,
     are you sure

10:20.654 --> 10:22.253
 this is how you want to
 spend your Saturday?

10:22.255 --> 10:24.923
   Dude. This movie
   is gonna be my calling card,

10:24.925 --> 10:27.025
    and it'll make
    Jamie Lee Curtis notice me.

10:27.027 --> 10:29.794
             Don't tell Lainey!
             No wait, tell her.
             She needs to know.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.998
 All right, first off,
 I wouldn't rock the boat
 of that relationship.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.968
 And secondly, I think I saw
 your Jenkintown Boys Club

10:36.970 --> 10:38.370
  down at the Wawa
  parking lot.

10:38.372 --> 10:40.472
          The JTP?
          Who was leading them?

10:40.474 --> 10:41.873
     I don't know.
     Some new guy.

10:41.875 --> 10:42.374
                    Was it Dan?
            Sure.

10:42.376 --> 10:45.777
         Stupid Dan!
         I will challenge him
         to a game of smashball

10:45.779 --> 10:47.345
     and reassert my dominance.

10:47.347 --> 10:47.779
         (TIRES SCREECH)

10:47.781 --> 10:50.048
     ADULT ADAM: <i> Turns out,</i>
    <i> when it came to being</i>
    <i> a producer,</i>

10:50.050 --> 10:52.417
    <i> my dad knew how to get</i>
    <i> exactly what he wanted.</i>

10:52.419 --> 10:55.420
 Why would he pass
 on the role of a lifetime?

10:55.422 --> 10:57.422
 Why?
 We're screwed blue!

10:57.424 --> 10:59.190
 We have no time to recast!

10:59.192 --> 11:00.158
          I'm way ahead of you.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.927
 Coach is here
 and ready for his closeup!

11:02.929 --> 11:04.796
 I am your clay.

11:04.798 --> 11:05.630
          Mold me.

11:05.632 --> 11:07.332
        Coach Mellor?
        He's our star?

11:07.334 --> 11:09.067
      Oh, yeah.
      I slipped him the script.

11:09.069 --> 11:09.968
          He responded
          to the material.

11:09.970 --> 11:15.040
 Well, I guess
 you're my only option,
 so...you got the part.

11:15.475 --> 11:17.409
                  You honor me.
 Do you know your lines?

11:17.411 --> 11:19.978
  I memorized the whole script.
  I love the zingers.

11:19.980 --> 11:22.947
             My favorite one...
             "See you ladle."

11:22.949 --> 11:26.851
   I like how you wrote "ladle"
   instead of "later."
   'Cause I'm a cook.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.953
 "See you ladle"?
 I didn't write that.

11:28.955 --> 11:32.023
      That'd be me.
      I did some noodling
      with the script, partner.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.458
  Dad! You can't
  rewrite my script!

11:33.460 --> 11:37.062
          But you didn't have
          any snappy one-liners
          like Arnold says.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.930
           That's the best part
           of an action movie.

11:38.932 --> 11:41.132
              Now you got
              a bunch of 'em.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.368
                Sear you later.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.170
                Spat-u-later.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.772
              Cheese ya grater.

11:47.774 --> 11:49.207
 They are all the same!

11:49.209 --> 11:53.078
 Dad, I appreciate the support,
 but this is still my movie.

11:53.080 --> 11:56.748
            Hey. Everyone knows
            that you're the
            creative vision

11:56.750 --> 11:58.349
          behind
         <i> "Recipe for Death 2."</i>

11:58.351 --> 12:00.418
 Two? We haven't even filmed
 part one.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.487
         The best action movies
         are always the sequel,

12:02.489 --> 12:04.656
 so we're just skipping ahead
 to the good stuff.

12:04.658 --> 12:06.458
     Know what?
     We're a team.

12:06.460 --> 12:10.095
 The important thing
 here is we're working on
 this together.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.996
 Pops, I need
 a new producer!

12:11.998 --> 12:13.732
           Huh?
           What am I producing?

12:13.734 --> 12:15.967
 80 bucks and no back talk.
                 I'm in.

  ADULT ADAM: <i> While I had found</i>
<i> a way to push my dad</i>
<i> out of the picture,</i>

 (GRUMBLING) Mmm-mmm.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.579
             We did. Thank you.

12:27.581 --> 12:28.646
       Whatever.

12:28.648 --> 12:29.247
 I have a coupon.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.750
     Oh. I'm sorry, this coupon
     is for Gimbels.

12:31.752 --> 12:35.053
 Correct.
 It's a competitor's coupon,
 so you match the price.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.322
 And when we're done here,
 I'm gonna need this back

12:37.324 --> 12:38.356
  so I can use it
  at other stores.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.892
        Yeah, we don't
        really consider Gimbels
        a competitor

12:40.894 --> 12:45.697
      because we're fresh
      and cool and hip and fun,
      and they're...closing.

12:45.699 --> 12:48.867
 Oh, God. Um. Just run
 the credit-card machine thing.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.101
 Let me get this straight.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.203
 Benetton thinks it's better
 than Gimbels

12:52.205 --> 12:55.807
 because you have
 all these glossy posters
 hanging around?

12:55.809 --> 12:58.543
 These kids were
 clearly dressed
 against their will.

12:58.545 --> 12:59.911
        Come on,
        make the ch-chunk.

12:59.913 --> 13:00.912
  This is bull corn.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.580
             Okay. I'm going to
             have to ask you

13:02.582 --> 13:04.516
          to take your business
          elsewhere.

13:04.518 --> 13:05.483
        Ho-ho!

13:05.485 --> 13:08.119
   You're banning me
   from your store?

13:08.121 --> 13:09.320
    No-no, sister.

13:09.322 --> 13:10.288
   I'm banning you.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.490
              You can't ban me.
      Oh, I just did.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.125
 You are Ban-itonned!

13:14.127 --> 13:15.326
             That's not a word.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.262
    Oh, it is now.
    I Bani-ton you

13:17.264 --> 13:21.299
 from having the pleasure of us
 in your store, sucka!

13:21.301 --> 13:22.300
 Come on, Erica.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.369
 The cu...I'm...
 BEVERLY: No!

13:24.371 --> 13:26.171
    ADULT ADAM: <i> While my mom</i>
   <i> was making a scene,</i>

13:26.173 --> 13:29.541
   <i> I was directing a scene</i>
   <i> of my own.</i>

13:29.543 --> 13:31.009
          We meet again, Blade.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.377
 Well, well, John Cook.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.712
 I'm surprised you survived
 the series of traps

13:34.714 --> 13:36.247
  I set
  in my deadly labyrinth.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.216
           Well, I'm back, a...

13:38.552 --> 13:43.521
     And I'm ready to
     spoon-feed you a delicious
     mouthful of pain.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.423
         I'll see ya ladle.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.626
 Looking for something?

13:48.628 --> 13:50.495
             Cut! Cut. Cut.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.096
         You're not selling it,
         Dave Kim.

13:52.098 --> 13:54.599
           Think about how dumb
           your haircut is.

13:54.601 --> 13:55.834
                 Use your pain.

13:55.836 --> 13:58.303
       Gah!
       Steady up the boom, Taz.

13:58.305 --> 13:59.270
          What's a boom?

13:59.272 --> 13:59.938
                It's the thing
                you're holding.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.273
          I kept whispering,
          "Boom" so you'd raise
          it out of frame.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.075
         Oh! I thought you
         were going like,

14:04.077 --> 14:07.045
     "Boom! We just got another
     great cinematic moment."

14:07.047 --> 14:08.847
      Ah. What's all this?

14:08.849 --> 14:10.215
          Oh! Hey!
          I thought sending you

14:10.217 --> 14:13.818
   to get donuts at the airport
   would take much longer.

14:13.820 --> 14:16.187
    You're shooting movies
    without me?

14:16.189 --> 14:16.721
              Kinda.

14:16.723 --> 14:19.090
      I thought we were doing
      this whole deal together.

14:19.092 --> 14:22.493
 Uh. I decided to go
 with a different producer.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.162
              (MUMBLING)
              I have no notes.

14:24.164 --> 14:25.697
             I love everything
             the kid does.

14:25.699 --> 14:28.933
            I don't get it.
            You said you wanted
            my support.

14:28.935 --> 14:31.269
    I do! I...I did.
    I don't.

14:31.271 --> 14:32.904
            You can't give back
            support.

14:32.906 --> 14:34.205
          I just did.
                     No!

14:34.207 --> 14:35.406
          You keep the support!

14:35.408 --> 14:36.674
           And you're gonna get
           much more!

14:36.676 --> 14:38.710
          I'm gonna support you
          but good!

14:38.712 --> 14:39.611
 Don't you dare say that!

14:39.613 --> 14:43.181
              Oh, you heard me!
              I'm a big blanket
              of support!

14:43.183 --> 14:44.482
                A big blanket!

14:44.484 --> 14:45.550
     You monster.

14:45.552 --> 14:48.086
              Fine!
              Do what you want.

14:48.421 --> 14:52.824
        Also, you got some kind
        of bag so I can bring
        home this fruit?

14:52.826 --> 14:54.692
           You sure about this?
          Oh, I'm sure.

14:54.694 --> 14:56.895
 My mom gets me banned
 from Benetton?

14:56.897 --> 14:59.397
 Then I'll just bring
 Benetton to me.

14:59.399 --> 15:03.001
 Uh (SCOFFS)
 you can't just make
 a sweater dress.

15:03.003 --> 15:04.502
                   Can't I?

15:05.005 --> 15:05.570
     ADULT ADAM: <i> She could.</i>

15:05.572 --> 15:09.374
   <i> My sister had access</i>
   <i> to the biggest, loudest</i>
   <i> sweater collection</i>

15:09.376 --> 15:10.775
     <i> in the greater</i>
     <i> Philadelphia area.</i>

15:10.777 --> 15:14.445
   She has a sweater
   that celebrates the culture
   of sweaters?

15:14.447 --> 15:15.413
    My mind is melting!

15:15.415 --> 15:17.515
        Hey.
        This one shows promise.

15:17.517 --> 15:20.018
 Yeah, but those sleeves.
 Blech.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.419
        But...

15:21.421 --> 15:22.687
 if you took these sleeves

15:22.689 --> 15:24.555
 and the bottom half
 of this sparkly one,

15:24.557 --> 15:25.356
 that could totally
 be a dress!

15:25.358 --> 15:27.825
   And if you took the
   rhinestones from this one...

15:27.827 --> 15:30.795
 And used this fringe
 and these ruffles

15:30.797 --> 15:34.232
  and these weird tiny pockets,
  that would totally work!

15:34.234 --> 15:35.099
                   So cute!

15:35.101 --> 15:36.334
 ADULT ADAM: <i> And so they sewed.</i>

15:36.336 --> 15:38.102
  <i> They searched. They glued.</i>

15:38.104 --> 15:40.438
     <i> They ripped, snipped,</i>
     <i> and glittered.</i>

15:40.440 --> 15:41.706
 Okay. The big reveal.

15:41.708 --> 15:44.842
 Eat your heart out, Bene...
 Oh, my God!

15:45.211 --> 15:46.577
             This did not work!

15:46.579 --> 15:47.412
    No, it did not!

15:47.414 --> 15:49.013
             This does not look
             like Benetton!

15:49.015 --> 15:49.580
   No, it does not!

15:49.582 --> 15:51.215
      We need to cut up
      more sweaters and fix it!

15:51.217 --> 15:52.617
   ADULT ADAM:
  <i> And so they did it again.</i>

15:52.619 --> 15:55.520
   <i> They sewed,</i>
   <i> they cut, they tore.</i>

15:55.522 --> 15:57.055
 <i> They generally made a mess...</i>

15:57.057 --> 16:00.591
 <i> until they got it just right.</i>

16:00.694 --> 16:02.527
              (VOICE BREAKING)
              I made it worse.

16:02.529 --> 16:04.429
    You really did!

16:04.864 --> 16:06.297
               Why?

16:06.299 --> 16:07.198
              Why?

16:07.200 --> 16:08.733
           (GASPS)
           My sweaters!

16:08.735 --> 16:10.134
       My glorious sweaters!

16:10.136 --> 16:13.504
   I'm realizing now this whole
   thing got away from me.

16:13.506 --> 16:14.672
    Gimbels is out of business!

16:14.674 --> 16:17.809
 I can't replace them.
 They're all I had.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.677
             It's not my fault!

16:19.679 --> 16:20.478
             I mean, it is.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.247
   What I did sucks,
   but what you did sucks, too!

16:23.249 --> 16:24.716
        You got me Ban-itonned!

16:24.718 --> 16:25.516
  That is not a word.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.685
  And I thought that
  the most important thing

16:27.687 --> 16:29.020
    was us spending time
    together.

16:29.022 --> 16:31.956
   What mattered was the dress!
   Not you!

16:36.096 --> 16:37.428
             Fine.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.530
          (SMACKS LIPS)

16:39.532 --> 16:41.132
        Go buy it.

16:41.334 --> 16:44.702
   Hope you feel good knowing
   the real price you paid.

16:45.472 --> 16:46.804
 I think the price was her.

16:46.806 --> 16:48.873
      I know the price, Lainey!

16:50.343 --> 16:52.577
  ADULT ADAM: <i> It had been a day</i>
<i> since me and my sister</i>

16:52.579 --> 16:54.345
      <i> tricked our parents</i>
      <i> into supporting us.</i>

16:54.347 --> 16:57.482
   <i> And now my mom and dad were</i>
   <i> farther from us than ever.</i>

16:57.484 --> 17:00.451
    Look at her. She's not even
    Parming the shrimp.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.653
        Without her Parm,
        it's just plain shrimp.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.188
 Wow, you really
 messed her up.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.757
                Wow, you really
                messed him up.

17:05.759 --> 17:10.094
 He's wearing pants and not
 touching his rocky road?

17:10.096 --> 17:11.429
   This is bad.

17:11.431 --> 17:11.996
                This is awful.

17:11.998 --> 17:13.631
    All I wanted was for my mom
    to leave me alone.

17:13.633 --> 17:16.701
 All I wanted was
 for my dad to be
 a little more involved.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.236
 Now I've completely
 pushed him away.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.338
 I know this is the last thing
 you want to hear,

17:20.339 --> 17:22.940
 but you've gotta figure out
 a way to make her feel good.

17:22.942 --> 17:24.842
          Just figure out a way
          to get him back.

17:24.844 --> 17:26.644
           Damn it, why are you
           always right?

17:26.646 --> 17:27.878
 Damn it, you're right.

17:27.881 --> 17:28.946
       'Sup?
            What the...

17:28.948 --> 17:29.981
          Where'd you
          come from?

17:29.983 --> 17:31.883
  Dad said Dan
  took over the JTP,

17:31.885 --> 17:33.951
 and I had to stop him
 at all costs.

17:33.953 --> 17:34.819
                  Who's Dan?
     No idea.

17:34.821 --> 17:37.088
  So I gave everyone in school
  named Dan a wedgie.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.790
        Look.
        Movie's done, bro.

17:38.792 --> 17:39.557
  Damn you, Stallone!

17:39.559 --> 17:42.794
 I assume he took the part
 after I fell out!

17:44.364 --> 17:45.596
 Get your coat.
 We're going shopping.

17:45.598 --> 17:49.167
       Nice try. I'm done being
       used for my charge card.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.002
  Actually, this time
  it's my treat.

17:51.004 --> 17:54.539
 The Gimbels downtown
 store is having a
 going-out-of-business sale.

17:54.541 --> 17:57.341
 One day only.
 Everything 50% off.

17:57.343 --> 17:58.810
             Big whoop.
             Sales come and go.

17:58.812 --> 18:00.244
 I also believe you've
 been collecting

18:00.246 --> 18:02.980
 a lifetime of coupons,
 one of which is good

18:02.982 --> 18:05.883
 for 50% off
 your entire purchase.

18:05.885 --> 18:07.085
         Again, not interested.

18:07.087 --> 18:09.921
 You should also know
 that I called my old
 Gimbels manager

18:09.923 --> 18:13.224
 and he said he would honor
 my employee discount.

18:13.226 --> 18:15.560
  Another 50% off.

18:15.562 --> 18:17.829
         That's half of half of
         half off.

18:17.831 --> 18:18.963
         The shopping trifecta.

18:18.965 --> 18:21.866
       Only the luckiest yentas
       ever get to see it.

18:21.968 --> 18:23.601
 I know I messed up.

18:23.603 --> 18:27.205
 But what do you say
 we go do some damage?
 Together.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.273
                Let's go make
                some memories!

   <i> That day, my mom and sister</i>

18:34.147 --> 18:36.380
    <i> Racks were emptied,</i>
    <i> displays were toppled,</i>

18:36.382 --> 18:41.552
  <i> sweaters were replaced,</i>
  <i> and carts were overflowing.</i>

18:41.554 --> 18:42.353
                  Go, go, go!

18:42.355 --> 18:43.688

       I'm on it!

 The reason
 he's cheating on you

18:48.027 --> 18:49.760
 is 'cause your house
 is so filthy.
                      Right?

18:49.762 --> 18:52.930
   This is my mom's!
   All of these are!

18:53.500 --> 18:54.532
    This is the proudest moment
    of my life.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.801

   <i> wasn't going out of</i>

19:02.742 --> 19:03.508
                     Yes!

             We did it!
             We did it!

19:09.883 --> 19:11.249
              Hey, can we talk?

19:11.251 --> 19:12.984
     No talk.
     I'm fine.

19:12.986 --> 19:15.052
            Well, then just sit
            in your chair.

19:15.054 --> 19:16.787
 I've never said no to that.

19:16.789 --> 19:17.722
             I wanna show you
             something.

   my one-liners.

19:38.711 --> 19:41.746
     Yeah. You're a pretty good
     producer after all.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.217
           Even though
           I kind of fired you,

19:46.219 --> 19:49.687
          it was really awesome
          having your support.

19:51.824 --> 19:52.757
       (SIGHS)

19:52.759 --> 19:54.492
 You know I'm not
 the kind of dad

19:54.494 --> 19:57.528
 who cheers and screams
 from the sidelines.

19:59.732 --> 20:03.634
 But it's really important
 for you to know

20:03.636 --> 20:06.837
 that I'll always be rooting
 for you.

20:07.574 --> 20:07.972
      Always.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.294

20:34.701 --> 20:36.200
   I don't know
   how you did that.

    See you ladle!

20:58.625 --> 21:00.758
         My dad has a seriously
         freaky talent

21:00.760 --> 21:02.927
         of making action-movie
         zingers. Watch.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.829
         Hey, Dad.
         What would Arnold say

21:04.831 --> 21:05.663
 if he threw a guy off a cliff?

21:05.665 --> 21:08.833
  "My favorite season is fall."
  "You've been grounded."

21:08.835 --> 21:11.335
  "It's a bird, it's a plane,
  it's a dead guy."

21:11.337 --> 21:12.837
    "Surprise!
    Hope you weren't thrown."

21:12.839 --> 21:15.339
       What would Arnold say
       to a guy he just fed
       to a lion?

21:15.341 --> 21:18.576
     "Pleased to eat you."
     "This won't hurt,
     or am I lyin'?"

21:18.578 --> 21:20.177
        "Show some pride."
 What would Arnold say

21:20.179 --> 21:21.479
  if he just ripped
  a guy's heart out?

21:21.481 --> 21:23.281
 "You're under cardiac arrest."

21:23.283 --> 21:24.348
 "Be my Valentine."

21:24.350 --> 21:25.449
 "Don't be so heartless."

21:25.451 --> 21:26.751
          He could be
          an action star.

21:26.753 --> 21:29.220
 Bevy! I need
 your strong fingers!

21:29.222 --> 21:30.688
           Or maybe not.
