00:06.758 --> 00:09.010
So what's the headcount
gonna be for Thanksgiving?

00:09.093 --> 00:11.179
Twelve ladies... and Scott.

00:11.262 --> 00:12.889
-Scott? Ding-dong!
-Oh.

00:12.972 --> 00:14.807
Way to bury the lead, you whore.

00:14.891 --> 00:15.808
It's just dinner.

00:15.892 --> 00:17.769
No, ma'am, it is not "just dinner." Okay?

00:17.852 --> 00:20.813
When one brings one's S.O.
to a holiday dinner,

00:20.897 --> 00:22.899
that signifies a serious commitment.

00:22.982 --> 00:25.151
-I don't think so.
-How long you guys been together?

00:25.235 --> 00:26.319
Like six months or something?

00:26.402 --> 00:28.321
-Has it been that long?
-Yeah, it's been that long.

00:28.404 --> 00:29.572
Now he's coming to Thanksgiving?

00:29.656 --> 00:31.574
That's a serious fucking relationship,
Maria.

00:31.658 --> 00:33.952
Serious effing relationship, Maria.

00:34.035 --> 00:37.205
Please don't fucking agree with me
after I agree with you.

00:37.872 --> 00:39.082
We've just been having fun.

00:39.165 --> 00:40.959
Well, that's how it starts.

00:41.042 --> 00:42.335
Don't freak out. Are you freaked out?

00:42.418 --> 00:44.295
Don't freak out, because, Maria...

00:44.379 --> 00:46.339
serious relationships are awesome.

00:46.422 --> 00:47.882
-Mmm-hmm.
-Right, Larissa?

00:47.966 --> 00:50.468
Oh, I'm sorry.
Fingers don't count. My bad.

00:50.551 --> 00:51.719
What up? What up?

00:51.803 --> 00:52.679
Hey!

00:52.762 --> 00:53.596
[Maria] Keith and Kenny,

00:53.680 --> 00:54.806
the Lucas brothers.

00:54.889 --> 00:56.432
-Hey.
-Hey.

00:56.516 --> 00:59.811
[all] Clink. Clink. Clink. Clink. Clink

00:59.894 --> 01:01.312
-[Maria] And Kenny.
-Clink.

01:01.396 --> 01:04.065
-[Maria] Oh, oh.
-Clink.

01:04.147 --> 01:05.191
[Kenny] Hey, Maria.

01:05.275 --> 01:06.734
What's up with that YouTube video?

01:07.610 --> 01:10.071
The one with me and Bert,
we're singing songs.

01:10.154 --> 01:12.156
-[guitar playing]
-[dog barking]

01:12.240 --> 01:13.700
-Nah. Not that one.
-Mmm-mmm.

01:13.783 --> 01:14.993
Blueberry and I in the tub?

01:15.076 --> 01:16.411
-[piano playing]
-[dog barking]

01:16.494 --> 01:18.204
-No pugs in this one.
-Not one pug.

01:18.288 --> 01:20.623
Well, then, I don't want to see it.

01:20.707 --> 01:22.792
-You wanna see this.
-No interest.

01:23.710 --> 01:24.836
Okay.

01:27.088 --> 01:30.091
Maria Bamford makes us bulletproof.

01:30.174 --> 01:31.342
-Bam, bam!
-[guns firing]

01:31.426 --> 01:34.345
We cannot be killed. Maria Bamford.

01:34.429 --> 01:35.430
-Bam, bam!
-[gun firing]

01:35.513 --> 01:37.682
<i>-Bam, bam!</i>
-[Maria] Is that me on a t-shirt?

01:37.765 --> 01:39.559
-It's a bit, right?
-It has to be

01:39.642 --> 01:40.935
for a comedy tour or something, right?

01:41.019 --> 01:43.146
-No.
-You do know that it's trending, right?

01:43.229 --> 01:44.647
All over social media.

01:44.731 --> 01:45.773
For the record,

01:45.857 --> 01:47.108
we don't agree with Oprah.

01:47.191 --> 01:48.359
[Dagmar] Oh.
[Kenny] Yeah.

01:48.443 --> 01:50.236
We don't think it's racist at all.

01:50.320 --> 01:52.196
[Maria] Oprah. Oh, my, Oprah.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.407
[hyperventilating] Oh, my sweet Oprah.

01:54.490 --> 01:56.784
Okay. I'm gonna straighten this out.

01:56.868 --> 01:59.537
I'm gonna straighten this out.

01:59.621 --> 02:01.122
[bell chiming]

02:01.205 --> 02:03.207
[theme music playing]

02:11.924 --> 02:14.093
[Maria vocalizing]

02:18.431 --> 02:24.187
I am VICI,
Voice Initiated Child Identicate.

02:24.270 --> 02:26.230
I am a small wonder.

02:26.314 --> 02:27.190
[Bruce] No, no!

02:27.273 --> 02:29.525
No, no, no!

02:29.609 --> 02:31.527
You sound like a human being
trying to be a robot.

02:31.611 --> 02:33.821
Just be the goddamn robot!

02:33.905 --> 02:35.657
Don't you be wasting my time!

02:35.740 --> 02:37.075
Don't waste Summer's time!

02:37.158 --> 02:39.452
Don't waste Austin's time.
You understand me?

02:39.535 --> 02:41.621
Do you want Mommy and Daddy
to drive you back to Iowa,

02:41.704 --> 02:43.581
so Daddy can go on sucking off truckers

02:43.665 --> 02:45.333
and your mother can slop the pigs?

02:45.416 --> 02:47.752
Do you? Do you?

02:47.835 --> 02:49.295
[crying]

02:49.379 --> 02:52.006
Finally, the emotion
we've been after all day.

02:52.090 --> 02:54.842
Now turn it off, because you're a robot.

02:54.926 --> 02:58.012
Bruce, I really need to talk to you.
Oh, God.

02:59.347 --> 03:00.348
Children.

03:00.431 --> 03:03.309
Yes, my queen.
Take five, you talentless twats.

03:04.102 --> 03:06.062
You stink, get some deodorant.

03:07.063 --> 03:09.190
So, how are you, my angel?

03:09.273 --> 03:11.442
Well, not good.
Have you seen the video?

03:11.526 --> 03:13.653
The one where you're in the tub
with the pugs?

03:13.736 --> 03:14.821
-[piano playing]
-[dog barking]

03:14.904 --> 03:16.030
Absolutely delightful.

03:16.114 --> 03:17.365
No, this one.

03:17.448 --> 03:21.327
-[video playing]
-Wait a second. Those are your t-shirts.

03:21.411 --> 03:24.038
-[gasping] Oh, my God. Oh--
<i>-Bam, bam!</i>

03:24.122 --> 03:29.085
Bruce, why are a bunch of child soldiers
in South Sudan

03:29.168 --> 03:32.130
wearing t-shirts with my face on them?

03:32.213 --> 03:35.091
That is an excellent question,
my Athenian goddess.

03:35.174 --> 03:37.427
It's one I might call highly unusual

03:37.510 --> 03:40.096
and strange in the utmost...

03:40.179 --> 03:42.932
I am the face
of a tween terrorist organization.

03:43.015 --> 03:46.018
-Is that a pitch?
-What? No. That is not a pitch.

03:46.102 --> 03:48.563
I'm sorry. It's hard
for me to turn it off.

03:48.688 --> 03:50.773
I mean, this biz
is so deep in my blood.

03:50.857 --> 03:52.817
Hollywood High, class of Lindsay Wagner.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.945
Bruce, isn't this the same exact t-shirt
you pitched me?

03:56.028 --> 03:58.990
My name on it with the words "Bam Bam"?

03:59.073 --> 04:01.534
It is exceedingly odd.
I do give you that.

04:01.617 --> 04:04.287
And I also give you
my solemn word that...

04:04.370 --> 04:06.330
I will get to the very bottom of it.

04:06.414 --> 04:09.167
Bruce, people are saying
mean things about me on social media,

04:09.250 --> 04:13.129
and perhaps more importantly...
children are dying.

04:13.212 --> 04:16.673
-Hey, it's Bam Bam. Bam, Bam, Bam!
-I gotta go. Okay.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.676
Worry not,
my comedy chrysanthemum.

04:18.760 --> 04:20.845
Consider this whole matter
completely dealt with.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.889
[children] Bam, bam, bam, bam...

04:24.015 --> 04:25.141
[Bruce] Really, Trevin?

04:25.224 --> 04:27.268
You choose now
to do some decent space work?

04:28.102 --> 04:30.605
You unholy bastard. Back to one!

04:32.523 --> 04:35.735
I can't believe I'm the face
of a children's militia.

04:35.818 --> 04:38.112
Don't worry about it.
Bruce said he had it handled.

04:38.196 --> 04:39.947
Exactly.

04:40.031 --> 04:41.574
Hey, out of curiosity,

04:41.657 --> 04:43.493
do you think Thanksgiving
is fraught with meaning

04:43.576 --> 04:45.036
in terms of interpersonal relationships?

04:45.119 --> 04:47.205
Like a signpost, a marker,
a milestone of commitment

04:47.288 --> 04:50.792
vis-à-vis one person to another?

04:50.875 --> 04:52.710
Fuck, no.
It's just another day.

04:52.794 --> 04:55.129
-Okay.
-It's just another dead turkey.

04:55.213 --> 04:59.175
Exactly.
That is why this... this works.

04:59.258 --> 05:01.511
-Yes, exactly. Okay.
-[cell phone chiming]

05:01.594 --> 05:02.637
Oh, God.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.347
What's this? Not another video.

05:04.430 --> 05:06.182
Oh, God. Okay.

05:07.475 --> 05:12.814
The "Bam Bam" Child Warriors are taking
over significant parts of Northern Chad.

05:12.897 --> 05:15.525
<i>Despite significant efforts</i>
<i>from UN Peacekeepers,</i>

05:15.608 --> 05:19.403
<i>the Bam Bam Child Warriors</i>
<i>press significantly forward,</i>

05:19.487 --> 05:22.740
<i>expanding their already</i>
<i>significant territorial powers.</i>

05:22.824 --> 05:26.410
Their political ideals as vacant
as their political guru

05:26.494 --> 05:28.788
and rumored significant financial backer,

05:28.871 --> 05:31.123
<i>Maria "Bam Bam" Bamford.</i>

05:31.207 --> 05:32.291
Financial backer?

05:32.375 --> 05:33.876
It's just the BBC.
Nobody takes them seriously.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.002
Look, here's another one.

05:35.086 --> 05:37.588
<i>So, Maria Bamford is </i>
<i>in the news this week.</i>

05:37.672 --> 05:41.509
Turns out she's sponsoring
a group of child warriors in Africa.

05:41.592 --> 05:44.262
Apparently, you have to be this tall
to ride the war.

05:44.345 --> 05:45.304
[audience laughing]

05:45.388 --> 05:47.765
Oh, God. It's getting worse.
There's another one.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.434
The National Children's Spelling Bee
is this weekend.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.019
The winner gets a cash prize,

05:52.103 --> 05:55.481
while the losers get to join
Maria Bamford's child army.

05:55.565 --> 05:58.067
-Can you spell AK-47?
-[audience laughing]

05:58.150 --> 05:59.735
-Oh, my God.
-[cell phone vibrating]

05:59.819 --> 06:01.028
I'm getting a text here.

06:01.112 --> 06:04.156
Oh, I hope it isn't about
the Bam Bam Warriors.

06:04.240 --> 06:07.618
Oh, no. It's from my buddy, Clark.
"Congratulations, Daddy."

06:09.287 --> 06:12.999
-Are you pregnant?
-No, I'm 45. That would be unsafe.

06:14.166 --> 06:17.336
-Wait, who told him I was pregnant?
-You did, on Twitter.

06:17.420 --> 06:21.132
[loudly] Oh, social media,
what hath thou wrought?

06:21.215 --> 06:23.718
"Fighting is whack! Hashtag, blessed."

06:23.801 --> 06:25.052
Now that...

06:25.136 --> 06:27.388
-That is a great message.
-I pretty much get on board with.

06:27.471 --> 06:29.557
"I love children.

06:29.640 --> 06:32.143
Even the brown ones.

06:32.226 --> 06:36.314
I'm having one of my own.
Hashtag, double blessed."

06:36.397 --> 06:38.941
-Okay, I did not write that.
-Was it Blueberry?

06:39.025 --> 06:41.485
No, I made sure
that she has no access to devices.

06:42.570 --> 06:44.238
There's no one who has the password...

06:45.323 --> 06:47.658
[yelling] God damn it, Bruce!

06:50.119 --> 06:51.954
Bruce, what is going on...

06:52.788 --> 06:53.998
here?

06:54.081 --> 06:58.085
I'm method tweeting. As you.
Situation well in hand.

06:58.169 --> 06:59.462
I also happen to be auditioning

06:59.545 --> 07:02.798
for the Venice Beach Outreach Theater's
production of <i>Tootsie.</i>

07:02.882 --> 07:06.552
Bruce, this is the plan...
that you tell everybody I'm pregnant?

07:06.636 --> 07:08.804
Yes. It's called a relatable narrative.

07:08.888 --> 07:12.099
First, you get all the sympathy,
and then wham-o,

07:12.183 --> 07:14.185
you let your hero or your heroine have it.

07:14.268 --> 07:16.812
Bruce, you've got to stop this.

07:16.896 --> 07:19.982
Don't worry, you're going to lose the baby

07:20.066 --> 07:23.110
after a very vigorous
horseback riding excursion.

07:23.194 --> 07:25.655
-Hashtag, Red Saddle.
-[cell phone chimes]

07:25.738 --> 07:27.740
Jeez, Bruce, that's dark.

07:27.823 --> 07:30.409
[chuckling] Oh, no.
Red Saddle is the name of the ranch.

07:30.493 --> 07:32.828
You thought I meant... Oh. God, no.

07:32.912 --> 07:37.917
Bruce... this is really
[yelling] freaking me out!

07:38.000 --> 07:40.753
Listen, I have some fantastic news,

07:40.836 --> 07:43.255
which I've withheld for dramatic value.

07:43.339 --> 07:45.967
Turns out Kimmel wants you
to do the show tomorrow.

07:46.050 --> 07:49.512
Kimmel? Me?
The day before Thanksgiving?

07:49.595 --> 07:52.640
Yes to all three.
So, what do you say, my sweet?

07:52.723 --> 07:54.100
Are you ready for the big time?

07:54.183 --> 07:56.018
Yes, but are they gonna
make fun of me?

07:56.811 --> 07:59.105
Well, maybe. I mean, it's possible,
but you can handle this.

07:59.188 --> 08:01.357
I mean, you're a powerful woman, right?

08:01.440 --> 08:03.109
[groans]

08:03.192 --> 08:06.320
[Maria] <i>Things were going</i>
<i>a lot better with my best friend, Susan.</i>

08:06.404 --> 08:08.197
<i>I even convinced her</i>
<i>to let her husband, Paul,</i>

08:08.280 --> 08:10.199
<i>go on a nature retreat</i>
<i>with my favorite therapist</i>

08:10.282 --> 08:12.535
<i>from the psych center, Bear Claw.</i>

08:13.577 --> 08:15.663
So what time is Paul coming home?

08:15.746 --> 08:17.456
Oh, who the heck knows?

08:17.540 --> 08:21.711
Two weeks in a [scoffs] spirit ditch
with your Indian friend, Bear Claw.

08:21.794 --> 08:24.839
You'd think he could
call or text me just once.

08:24.922 --> 08:27.550
Well, there probably
isn't service in the spirit hole.

08:27.633 --> 08:31.012
He's not gonna get service in this hole,
unless he gives me a call.

08:31.095 --> 08:33.431
[smacking lips]

08:33.514 --> 08:38.727
Well... I'm proud of you, that you
let Paul go on that nature retreat.

08:38.811 --> 08:41.438
I did it to teach him a lesson.
He's gonna hate it.

08:41.522 --> 08:42.606
[TV switching off]

08:42.690 --> 08:45.609
You know, he's not the only one
that's exploring their creative side.

08:45.693 --> 08:48.279
-Oh.
-I had that awesome directing gig,

08:48.362 --> 08:50.614
recently, and I really got bit
by the art bug.

08:50.698 --> 08:55.202
So, I'm secretly taking stand-up workshop
down at the community college.

08:55.745 --> 08:56.829
So...

08:56.912 --> 09:00.958
[exclaims] I don't... I don't mean
to steal your spotlight, you know,

your thunder from down under.

09:03.753 --> 09:05.171

You wanna check it?

09:06.839 --> 09:08.424
-Yeah, yeah. That's--
-All right.

09:08.507 --> 09:11.010
Welcome, Susan Beeber!
[chuckles]

09:11.761 --> 09:17.224
I'm usually a lawyer.
But I'm also a mother. [chuckles]

09:17.308 --> 09:21.270
And I find time
to do charity work on the side.

09:21.395 --> 09:24.065
[laughing] Also...
Oh, I was...

09:24.148 --> 09:26.317
I was so popular in high school,

09:26.400 --> 09:31.822
and I'm still popular now,
with the people that I work with.

09:31.906 --> 09:33.491
[laughing]

09:35.951 --> 09:37.411
That's what I got so far.

-Okay.
-Okay?

09:40.623 --> 09:43.501
I basically just pulled my pants down
for you

09:43.584 --> 09:48.005
and show you my comedy spot,
and you just diarrhea-ed all over me.

09:48.089 --> 09:49.381
Why can't you just support me?

09:49.465 --> 09:51.342
-I do support you--
-God, you're so jealous.

09:51.425 --> 09:55.096
-No, I'm not.
-You're... You're so jealous.

09:55.179 --> 09:58.015
-Jealous. [humming]
-I am not jealous.

09:58.099 --> 10:01.852
Boom! You're also... [grunts]
You're jealous of Paul and I, too.

10:01.936 --> 10:05.981
-Uh-huh. Ow. Oh, yeah.
-I am not at all jealous of you and Paul.

10:06.065 --> 10:07.149
-Jealous.
-No.

10:07.233 --> 10:08.776
-[grunting]
-I don't want what you guys have at all.

10:08.859 --> 10:11.237
It's weird. You want him to be sad.

10:12.154 --> 10:14.073
That's weird.

10:14.657 --> 10:16.117
Do you know why, Maria?

10:17.118 --> 10:18.119
I'm sad.

10:19.036 --> 10:22.706
Okay, happy? You get to go off...
and, like, chase your dreams.

10:22.790 --> 10:27.128
And I'm here, married to a guy
that I don't even love anymore.

10:28.087 --> 10:31.340
Jealous of my honesty? [exclaims]

10:31.423 --> 10:33.676
-[grunts]
-[Marilyn] Girls.

10:34.468 --> 10:37.179
-Wow.
-Uh-oh. Did I walk into a fight zone?

10:37.263 --> 10:38.639
I was just gonna go.

10:38.722 --> 10:41.058
Susan, don't go.

10:41.142 --> 10:42.393
-[cell phone ringing]
-[Susan] Oh, God.

10:44.478 --> 10:45.980
Hello.

10:46.105 --> 10:47.273
Yeah, this is she.

10:50.568 --> 10:52.611
Oh, my God. [gasps]

10:52.695 --> 10:55.030
-What's wrong?
-Paul's dead.

10:55.114 --> 10:56.657
-What?
-Oh, my God.

10:56.740 --> 10:58.701
[breathing heavily]

10:58.784 --> 11:01.036
[sobbing] I just can't believe
I'm never gonna see him again.

11:01.120 --> 11:04.707
And I didn't think
I loved him anymore, but I do.

11:04.790 --> 11:06.458
-[Marilyn] Oh, sweetie.
-I just...

11:06.542 --> 11:10.796
I got so bogged down, you know,
with the kids and the dogs,

11:10.880 --> 11:13.883
[sniffling]
and my ridiculously successful law job.

11:13.966 --> 11:15.050
The Lexus.

11:15.134 --> 11:19.138
-[Marilyn] Yes.
-Oh, God. Paul. [sobbing]

11:19.221 --> 11:20.598
Paul!

11:20.681 --> 11:22.725
-[Paul] Yeah?
-Paul!

11:22.808 --> 11:26.562
-Oh, my God. Paul! [squealing]
-Hi.

11:26.687 --> 11:29.356
-[Susan] Oh, God. You're alive.
-[chuckling] Wow.

11:29.440 --> 11:30.900
That's what I call a welcome home.

11:30.983 --> 11:33.360
I was just driving home
and I saw your car parked out front.

11:33.444 --> 11:34.695
The Lexus.

11:34.778 --> 11:37.197
-[laughing] We thought you were dead.
-[Susan] Yes.

11:37.281 --> 11:39.116
-I'm definitely not dead.
-[laughing]

11:39.199 --> 11:41.243
I did lose my wallet crossing the river...

11:41.327 --> 11:42.828
-[all laughing]
-...during my...

11:42.912 --> 11:45.205
during my past life soak regression.

11:45.289 --> 11:46.957
-Susan, here's the thing, okay?
-Yes.

11:47.041 --> 11:50.169
Okay... during those two weeks
that I was in the spirit hole,

11:50.252 --> 11:51.712
listening to Bear Claw chant,

11:51.795 --> 11:53.714
I never felt more alive.

11:53.797 --> 11:55.925
-[laughing]
-[Susan] And now that you're back,

11:56.008 --> 11:57.468
I've never felt more alive.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.553
-Paul, I gotta tell you something.
-Okay, me first.

11:59.637 --> 12:00.721
-Okay.
-Me first.

12:00.804 --> 12:03.349
Bear Claw woke up my soul.

12:03.432 --> 12:05.893
He said that I should
really go for it in life.

12:05.976 --> 12:08.812
-I'm gonna go for it.
-Oh, God.

12:08.938 --> 12:10.481
I feel the same way. [chuckles]

12:10.564 --> 12:13.442
Bear Claw and I are in love,
and we're gonna move in together.

12:13.525 --> 12:15.903
He's got an adorable cabin
in Fond du Lac.

12:15.986 --> 12:18.197
-[Maria] Uh-oh.
-I'm finally living my truth.

12:18.280 --> 12:20.324
-Oh.
-[Paul] I have Maria to thank for it.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.450
Oh, no.

12:22.785 --> 12:25.371
[exclaiming]

12:25.454 --> 12:28.248
[screaming]

12:28.332 --> 12:30.292
Oh! [grunting]

12:31.210 --> 12:32.711
[screaming]

12:33.712 --> 12:35.798
Here's how this is gonna go.

12:38.092 --> 12:41.512
You're not moving
into anybody's adorable cabin,

12:41.595 --> 12:43.889
and if you ever
want to see your kids again,

12:43.973 --> 12:50.312
you will only see Bear Claw in the summer
and we will never speak of this again.

12:52.606 --> 12:53.857
[sighs]

12:56.777 --> 12:58.237
[exclaiming]

13:00.364 --> 13:01.615
[door slams]

13:05.995 --> 13:08.580
I knew you would like Bear Claw.

13:08.664 --> 13:10.207
[Paul softly] Yeah, he's great.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.418
[Marilyn] How about some cheese?

13:13.961 --> 13:16.880
[stuttering] That's a good idea.
I'm gonna... Cheese.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.424
I'm... I'm gonna get some.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.806
-[audience clapping]
-[upbeat music playing]

13:31.812 --> 13:35.357
[chuckling] To be honest,
I thought this was the other Kimmel show.

13:35.441 --> 13:36.984
You mean my sister Wendy's podcast?

13:37.067 --> 13:38.861
Good luck.
They're booked through next year.

13:44.033 --> 13:45.242
[grunts]

13:45.325 --> 13:47.995
-[audience clapping]
-[music stops]

13:48.078 --> 13:50.289
And we're back!

13:50.372 --> 13:54.084
Thank you Santa Clarita Wildcats'
very own number-one DJ,

13:54.168 --> 13:56.754
Jason T.
Good work, Jason.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.756
-I wouldn't call it work.
-[audience laughing]

13:58.839 --> 14:01.550
[chuckles] Good one.
So, Maria.

14:01.633 --> 14:04.303
Don't get any ideas
about this crew of mine.

14:04.386 --> 14:07.598
Hey, kids, if she tries
to hand you a t-shirt, run.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.349
Bam Bam! [laughing]

14:09.433 --> 14:11.435
[audience laughing]

14:11.518 --> 14:15.731
Actually, Ginny,
if I could say something about that--

14:15.814 --> 14:18.692
And before you do,
I would just like to say something.

14:18.776 --> 14:21.403
We are so sorry about your miscarriage.

14:21.487 --> 14:22.613
[audience murmuring]

14:22.696 --> 14:25.908
Horseback riding. God damn it.

14:25.991 --> 14:27.743
I'd also like to say something about that.

14:27.826 --> 14:28.994
My mom had a miscarriage.

14:29.078 --> 14:30.162
[audience] Aw...

14:30.245 --> 14:32.122
-But I made it.
-Just barely.

14:32.206 --> 14:34.166
[all laughing]

14:34.249 --> 14:36.251
-And we're back to laughing...
-[audience applauding]

14:36.335 --> 14:38.295
...which is so important.

14:38.379 --> 14:41.090
First of all, I need to say
that I have no idea

14:41.173 --> 14:44.218
where those t-shirts came from,
and I had nothing to do with it.

14:44.301 --> 14:48.222
Well, the journalism club at Santa Clarita
Junior High did a little digging...

14:48.305 --> 14:51.308
and they traced an invoice
and a work order

14:51.392 --> 14:54.561
back to your very own manager,
Bruce Ben-Bacharach.

14:54.645 --> 14:55.687
What?

14:55.813 --> 14:57.481
Come on up here, Bruce.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.024
-[audience exclaims]
-Me?

14:59.108 --> 15:00.359
-Get up here.
-[upbeat music playing]

15:02.361 --> 15:06.782
According to the International Exploited
Workers Club at Santa Clarita High...

15:06.865 --> 15:10.911
Bruce ordered
over 10,000 Bam Bam t-shirts

15:10.994 --> 15:13.580
from a sweatshop in Honduras.

15:13.664 --> 15:17.167
Upon sensing that you were
less than enthusiastic,

15:17.251 --> 15:21.588
-he then sent them overnight to Africa.
-[audience exclaims]

15:21.672 --> 15:23.048
Bruce, is that true?

15:23.132 --> 15:27.094
No, not at all. This is lies,
prevarications, hearsay. That's all.

15:27.177 --> 15:29.721
Not according
to the After School Gumshoe Club...

15:29.805 --> 15:32.933
led by Chantrelle's son,
M'orell Thompson.

15:33.016 --> 15:34.393
[audience gasping]

15:34.476 --> 15:37.020
Chantrelle! You leaky faucet!

15:37.104 --> 15:38.730
-Fine. I'm fine.
-[man] Take it easy.

15:38.814 --> 15:42.401
Bruce! God damn it.
How could you lie to me?

15:42.484 --> 15:44.361
Maria, you didn't want the truth.

15:44.445 --> 15:47.656
I specifically asked for the truth.

15:47.739 --> 15:50.534
[voice breaking] I'm sorry.
I... I fudged up.

15:51.785 --> 15:54.663
I just wanted to make some scratch
from some merch.

15:54.746 --> 15:57.749
But it seemed like you didn't cotton
to the whole Bam Bam t-shirt idea.

15:57.833 --> 15:58.959
Pun intended.

15:59.042 --> 16:00.752
So I sent them off to the dark continent,

16:00.836 --> 16:02.629
where they were intercepted
by some warriors,

16:02.713 --> 16:04.548
never even got my tax credit,

16:04.631 --> 16:06.717
and now, they're in those tiny,
murderous hands.

16:06.800 --> 16:10.971
My queen... I shall throw myself
upon my own sword.

16:11.054 --> 16:14.141
As of this moment, I hereby fire myself.

16:14.224 --> 16:15.851
[audience exclaiming]

16:17.060 --> 16:18.312
Oh.

16:19.313 --> 16:21.315
Uh, Bruce.
Bruce, Bruce, Bruce, Bruce.

16:21.398 --> 16:23.775
[stuttering]
I don't accept your self-firing.

16:26.111 --> 16:28.030
Everybody makes mistakes. [chuckles]

16:28.113 --> 16:29.156
I heard that.

16:29.239 --> 16:30.491
[all chuckling]

16:31.283 --> 16:32.284
Thank you so much.

16:32.367 --> 16:34.369
-Your graciousness, your generosity...
-Okay. Yes.

16:34.453 --> 16:36.788
-...your elegance, your... your grace.
-Okay.

16:36.872 --> 16:39.583
Well, you know, we're in this together.
Let's...

16:39.666 --> 16:42.002
We'll put this behind us.
We're a team.

16:42.085 --> 16:46.548
You okay? I forgive you
and just never lie to me again.

16:46.632 --> 16:48.217
No, ma'am.
Never again.

16:50.552 --> 16:52.471
-Lover. Mother.
-Okay. All right.

16:52.554 --> 16:54.515
-Angel. Sister.
-Yes.

16:54.598 --> 16:57.100
-[chuckling]
-Princess. Queen...

16:57.184 --> 16:58.602
Khaleesi.

16:58.685 --> 17:02.940
Come back after the break
to find out if Bruce is the father.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.858
[upbeat music playing]

17:06.609 --> 17:08.819
That was great, you guys.
We're gonna fake the DNA results.

17:08.904 --> 17:10.446
You're not the father,
so just look relieved.

17:10.531 --> 17:11.990
Okay.

17:17.287 --> 17:20.707
[Maria quietly] Bark, bark, bark,
bark, bark, bark...

17:25.796 --> 17:27.047
[muttering]

17:28.423 --> 17:30.008
[yawning]

17:30.092 --> 17:31.593
Checklist.

17:31.677 --> 17:33.136
-[bell ringing]
-[director] Cut, cut, cut!

17:33.220 --> 17:37.015
Wow! Well, apparently Patches isn't
the only thing to take a big giant shit

17:37.099 --> 17:38.517
on set this morning.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.310
-[Patches whimpering]
-[Maria] I'm so sorry.

17:40.394 --> 17:42.688
I'm on new medication.
It just makes me sleepy.

17:42.813 --> 17:45.274
Oh, yeah? New medication may make
you sleepy, is that right?

17:45.357 --> 17:47.901
Well, I have a prescription for you.
It's called trucker speed.

17:47.985 --> 17:50.279
Talk to Eddy in props. God!

17:50.362 --> 17:52.948
Sorry. I just...

17:53.031 --> 17:55.367
It's got some side effects that just...
[sighs]

17:55.450 --> 17:57.035
-Surprise! It's me.
-[Maria yelps]

17:57.119 --> 17:58.829
-[sing-song] With roses.
-Graham...

17:58.912 --> 18:00.622
-What are you doing here?
-[chuckles]

18:00.706 --> 18:01.748
I got off early from set,

18:01.832 --> 18:05.919
and so I thought I'd swing by
and say hello to my number-one girl.

18:06.003 --> 18:08.463
[groggily] Oh, nice.
That's funny.

18:09.673 --> 18:10.757
You okay?

18:10.841 --> 18:13.135
Yeah, it's just...
I'm just a little sleepy. I just...

18:13.218 --> 18:14.886
What is that?

18:14.970 --> 18:19.016
Oh, these are...
It's meds for manic depression.

18:19.099 --> 18:23.437
I have bipolar II.
I've been meaning to tell you.

18:23.520 --> 18:26.940
You know how you love my wild energy.

18:27.024 --> 18:30.485
[laughing]
It's because I've been hypomanic.

18:30.569 --> 18:31.820
But I love you.

18:31.903 --> 18:34.865
I love you so much
that I'm gonna take care of myself.

18:34.948 --> 18:37.117
I'm gonna take my meds.
[groaning]

18:37.200 --> 18:39.620
You know what I mean,
'cause your mom had depression.

18:39.703 --> 18:41.288
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Completely. You know.

18:41.371 --> 18:43.999
-And you didn't get it. That was weird.
-Um...

18:44.082 --> 18:45.208
[swallowing pill]

18:45.292 --> 18:46.543
[Graham] Yeah, uh...

18:48.795 --> 18:53.467
[stuttering] I cannot do this.
I'm out. We're over.

18:53.550 --> 18:55.010
We're over? Why?

18:55.093 --> 18:57.512
I spent most of my childhood taking care
of my mom and her depression.

18:57.596 --> 18:59.139
I'm not gonna do that again.
I can't.

18:59.222 --> 19:02.059
Well, I'm not your mother
in so many ways.

19:02.142 --> 19:03.769
[stammers] Two of them sexual.

19:03.852 --> 19:06.480
Can't we fight about this at least?

19:06.605 --> 19:10.400
-I may be a stuntman, but I don't fight.
-Oh...

19:10.484 --> 19:13.654
Once you fight once in a relationship,
it's over.

19:13.737 --> 19:17.032
-I'm just saving us the trouble.
-That doesn't seem right.

19:17.115 --> 19:19.826
Look, kid, we had a good run.
No hard feelings?

19:20.827 --> 19:22.913
Mail me back the ring
when you get a chance.

19:22.996 --> 19:25.415
[groggily] Oh, Graham, no...

19:26.833 --> 19:28.919
[groaning] Oh, Graham...

19:36.134 --> 19:38.345
I let the Pitchapalooza
shit show go,

19:38.428 --> 19:40.430
because I figured you were going full lez,

19:40.514 --> 19:42.307
but this is where you start hurting me.

19:42.391 --> 19:44.768
And that's when these Loubs
go straight up your ass.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.144
[shouting] What happened today?

19:46.269 --> 19:48.480
I know. I... was off.

19:48.563 --> 19:51.775
-Just... Graham left and--
