00:52.750 --> 00:57.485
<i>Before time began, there was the Cube.</i>

00:58.024 --> 01:00.151
<i>We know not where it comes from,</i>

01:00.260 --> 01:06.495
<i>only that it holds the power
to create worlds and fill them with life.</i>

01:07.000 --> 01:10.094
<i>That is how our race was born.</i>

01:10.203 --> 01:12.671
<i>For a time, we lived in harmony,</i>

01:12.772 --> 01:19.336
<i>but like all great power,
some wanted it for good, others for evil.</i>

01:19.813 --> 01:22.577
<i>And so began the war,</i>

01:22.682 --> 01:27.710
<i>a war that ravaged our planet
until it was consumed by death,</i>

01:28.254 --> 01:32.953
<i>and the Cube was lost
to the far reaches of space.</i>

01:33.626 --> 01:39.360
<i>We scattered across the galaxy,
hoping to find it and rebuild our home,</i>

01:39.466 --> 01:43.960
<i>searching every star, every world.</i>

01:44.504 --> 01:50.443
<i>And just when all hope seemed lost,
message of a new discovery drew us</i>

01:50.543 --> 01:54.980
<i>to an unknown planet called Earth.</i>

02:01.855 --> 02:04.255
<i>But we were already too late.</i>

02:17.770 --> 02:19.795
Oh, God, five months of this.

02:19.906 --> 02:22.397
I can't wait to get a little taste of home.

02:22.509 --> 02:24.534
<i>A plate of mama's alligators Ã©touffÃ©e.</i>

02:24.644 --> 02:26.845
You've been talking
about barbecued 'gators and crickets

02:26.913 --> 02:30.076
for the last two weeks. I'm never going
to your mama's house, Fig. I promise.

02:30.183 --> 02:33.482
But Bobby, Bobby, 'gators are known
to have the most succulent meat.

02:33.586 --> 02:34.644
I understand.

02:38.291 --> 02:40.521
English, please. English.

02:40.660 --> 02:44.323
I mean, how many times have we...
We don't speak Spanish. I told you that.

02:44.430 --> 02:46.625
Why you got to ruin it for me, man?
That's my heritage.

02:49.435 --> 02:50.663
Go with the Spanish. Whatever.

02:50.770 --> 02:55.798
Hey, you guys remember weekends?
Huh? The Sox at Fenway.

02:55.909 --> 02:58.571
- Cold hotdog and a flat beer.
- Perfect day.

02:59.646 --> 03:02.638
What about you, Captain?
You got a perfect day?

03:02.982 --> 03:05.780
I just can't wait to hold my baby girl
for the first time.

03:05.885 --> 03:07.375
- He's adorable.
- That's too...

03:07.487 --> 03:08.454
Shut up!

03:27.407 --> 03:29.375
Hey, I'm ready to do this.

03:29.809 --> 03:32.369
Hey, any of y'all grow some balls,
come see me on the court, man.

03:32.478 --> 03:33.570
Hey, hey!

03:36.616 --> 03:37.878
Watch this crossover, baby.

03:37.984 --> 03:41.147
Like Jordan in his prime,
pushing through the front line.

03:41.988 --> 03:44.149
- Step aside, ladies.
- Oh, man. What?

03:44.257 --> 03:46.521
- Lennox!
- Hey, what are you doing?

03:46.626 --> 03:49.220
- Water?
- Thank you.

03:49.462 --> 03:50.902
Are you gonna help me with the gear?

03:58.037 --> 04:02.371
Colonel Sharp, we have an inbound
unidentified infiltrator, 10 miles out.

04:07.146 --> 04:11.606
<i>Unidentified aircraft, you are
in restricted US military airspace.</i>

04:11.718 --> 04:14.516
Squawk ident and proceed east
out of the area.

04:16.755 --> 04:20.452
Raptors one and two, snap to heading
two-five-zero to intercept.

04:20.560 --> 04:23.393
Bogie is in the weeds ten miles out,
not squawking.

04:28.134 --> 04:33.037
Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you
to US SOCCENT airbase.

04:33.139 --> 04:36.267
If you do not comply,
we will use deadly force.

04:38.144 --> 04:39.577
Copy the bogie.

04:39.679 --> 04:42.239
<i>Tail 4500 X-Ray.</i>

04:42.348 --> 04:44.816
Sir, says here 4500 X
was shot down three months ago.

04:44.917 --> 04:46.748
- Afghanistan.
- That's got to be a mistake.

04:46.853 --> 04:48.912
- Check again, then recheck.
- I did, sir.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.990
A friend of mine was on that chopper.

04:51.791 --> 04:55.591
<i>Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you
to US SOCCENT airbase.</i>

04:57.830 --> 05:01.027
- Radar, where's the inbound?
- Bogie's five miles out, sir.

05:04.570 --> 05:06.265
- My wife on?
- Yes, Captain.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.268
<i>- My ladies!
- Look.</i>

05:10.610 --> 05:12.373
Oh, my goodness. Look at her.
She's getting so big.

05:12.478 --> 05:15.606
<i>Look at those cheeks.
I just wanna chew on them.</i>

05:15.915 --> 05:17.439
<i>Baby, we made a good-looking kid.</i>

05:17.550 --> 05:19.677
I know that people say that all the time,

05:19.786 --> 05:22.152
but, wow, we made
one good-looking kid. Nice work.

05:22.255 --> 05:24.018
She has your laugh.

05:24.123 --> 05:26.717
<i>- She laughed?
- Her first one, yeah.</i>

05:26.826 --> 05:29.761
<i>You sure she didn't just fart?</i>

05:29.862 --> 05:31.659
No, she's a lady.

05:31.764 --> 05:34.255
She doesn't know you yet, but she will.

05:36.202 --> 05:38.670
4500 X. Something's not right.

05:43.710 --> 05:45.405
<i>Bogie's on the deck.</i>

05:45.878 --> 05:48.642
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Radar's jammed.

05:50.149 --> 05:52.014
It's coming from the chopper.

05:52.418 --> 05:54.682
<i>- Will?
- Sarah?</i>

05:54.787 --> 05:58.623
Hey, Sarah, if you can hear me,
I love you and I'll be home soon.

06:01.728 --> 06:04.322
- To the right. Go to the right.
- Check fire.

06:08.167 --> 06:11.398
MH-53 pilot, power down now.

06:15.274 --> 06:17.765
Have your crew step out
or we will kill you.

06:26.786 --> 06:29.619
Hold your fire! Stand by to engage!

06:36.729 --> 06:37.855
My God.

06:54.514 --> 06:58.143
They bombed the antenna farm!
We're under attack!

07:26.012 --> 07:28.344
Go! Move! Move!

07:35.288 --> 07:36.983
It's going after the files!

07:37.089 --> 07:38.454
Cut the hard lines!

07:38.558 --> 07:40.492
I need a key! It's locked!

07:42.361 --> 07:44.022
Move! Move!

07:49.335 --> 07:51.735
Here, come here! Come here!

08:07.086 --> 08:08.781
Here, hide in here!

08:09.121 --> 08:10.986
Oh, my God. Okay.

08:12.658 --> 08:13.647
No!

08:15.461 --> 08:16.428
Oh!

08:26.405 --> 08:28.236
What the...

08:37.116 --> 08:38.947
Epps, let's go!

08:59.105 --> 09:01.403
Okay, Mr. Witwicky, you're up.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.140
Sorry, I got a lot of stuff.

09:04.243 --> 09:05.437
Watch.

09:05.578 --> 09:06.545
Okay.

09:07.980 --> 09:09.242
For my family...

09:09.348 --> 09:13.785
Who did... Who did that?
People! Responsibility.

09:17.089 --> 09:18.056
Okay.

09:19.625 --> 09:21.183
So, for my family genealogy report,

09:21.294 --> 09:24.422
I decided to do it
on my great-great-grandfather,

09:24.797 --> 09:27.766
who was a famous man,
Captain Archibald Witwicky.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.258
Very famous explorer.

09:29.368 --> 09:35.796
In fact, he was one of the first to explore
the Arctic Circle, which is a big deal.

09:37.643 --> 09:43.104
<i>In 1897, he took 41 brave sailors
straight into the Arctic Shelf.</i>

09:44.050 --> 09:48.214
Move faster, men! Move! Chop! Heave!

09:48.387 --> 09:53.723
The ice is freezing faster than
it's melting! Chop faster! Heave, men!

09:54.026 --> 09:58.656
Heave! No sacrifice, no victory!

09:58.798 --> 10:01.164
We'll get to the Arctic Circle, lads!

10:02.134 --> 10:04.364
So that's the story, right?

10:04.470 --> 10:06.671
And here we have some of
the basic instruments and tools

10:06.772 --> 10:08.603
used by 19th-century seamen.

10:09.976 --> 10:11.910
This here is the quadrant,
which you can get for 80 bucks.

10:12.011 --> 10:13.308
It's all for sale, by the way.

10:13.412 --> 10:18.111
Like the sextant here.
$50 for this, which is a bargain.

10:18.317 --> 10:20.683
These are pretty cool.
These are my grandfather's glasses.

10:20.786 --> 10:23.516
I haven't quite gotten them appraised
yet, but they've seen many cool things.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.853
Are you going to sell me his liver?

10:25.992 --> 10:28.552
Mr. Witwicky, this isn't show and sell.
It's the 11th grade.

10:28.661 --> 10:29.753
I don't think your grandfather would be

10:29.862 --> 10:31.090
particularly proud of what you're doing.

10:31.197 --> 10:34.428
I know. I'm sorry. I just, you know,
this is all going towards my car fund.

10:34.533 --> 10:36.613
You can tell your folks. It's on eBay.
I take Paypal.

10:36.702 --> 10:38.033
Cold hard cash works, too.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.435
And the compass makes a great gift
for Columbus Day.

10:40.539 --> 10:41.870
- Sam!
- Sorry.

10:42.108 --> 10:43.803
Unfortunately,
my great-great-grandfather,

10:43.909 --> 10:48.744
the genius that he was, wound up
going blind and crazy in a psycho Ward,

10:48.848 --> 10:50.008
drawing these strange symbols

10:50.116 --> 10:52.584
and babbling on about
some giant ice man

10:52.685 --> 10:54.346
that he thought he'd discovered.

10:54.453 --> 10:58.287
Okay. Might be a pop quiz tomorrow.
Might not.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.792
- Sleep in fear tonight.
- Here, you want? Here, 50. 40? 30?

11:00.793 --> 11:03.125
- Sam?
- Yeah. Sorry, sorry.

11:03.229 --> 11:05.789
Okay. Pretty good, right?

11:07.233 --> 11:10.134
I'd say a solid B-.

11:11.837 --> 11:12.826
A B-?

11:12.938 --> 11:14.963
You were Hawking
your great-grandfather's crap

11:15.074 --> 11:16.234
- in my classroom.
- No, kids enjoy...

11:16.342 --> 11:17.570
- Look, can you do me a favor?
- What?

11:17.677 --> 11:20.037
Can you look out the window
for a second? You see my father?

11:20.112 --> 11:21.673
- He's the guy in the green car.
- Yeah.

11:21.781 --> 11:24.409
Okay, I wanna tell you about a dream.
A boy's dream.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.280
And a man's promise to that boy.

11:26.385 --> 11:29.218
He looked at me in the eye.
He said, "Son, I'm gonna buy you a car."

11:29.321 --> 11:31.585
"But I want you to bring me $2,000
and three As."

11:31.691 --> 11:33.818
Okay? I got the 2,000 and I got two As.

11:33.926 --> 11:37.987
Okay? Here's the dream. Your B-.
Dream gone. Kaput.

11:38.864 --> 11:42.891
Sir, just ask yourself,
what would Jesus do?

11:44.336 --> 11:45.633
Yes! Yes, yes.

11:47.173 --> 11:48.140
So?

11:48.474 --> 11:49.441
A-. It's an A, though.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.305
Wait, wait, wait. I can't see. It's an A.

11:51.410 --> 11:53.105
- So I'm good?
- You're good.

11:53.879 --> 11:57.110
- I got a little surprise for you, son.
- What kind of...

11:57.450 --> 11:59.441
Yeah, a little surprise.

12:00.486 --> 12:04.081
No. No, no, no, no. Dad!

12:05.057 --> 12:06.547
- Oh, you got to be kidding me.
- See?

12:06.659 --> 12:09.594
Yeah. I am.
You're not getting a Porsche.

12:12.798 --> 12:14.959
- You think that's funny?
- Yeah, I think it's funny.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.534
- What's wrong with you?
- You think I'd really get you

12:16.635 --> 12:19.297
a Porsche for your first car?

12:19.405 --> 12:21.600
I don't want to talk to you
for the rest of this whole thing.

12:21.707 --> 12:25.199
- Oh, come on. It's just a practical joke.
- It's not a funny joke.

12:27.847 --> 12:29.815
- Manny!
- What?

12:30.750 --> 12:32.484
Get your cousin out of
that damn clown suit.

12:32.485 --> 12:33.577
He's having a heat stroke again.

12:33.686 --> 12:34.744
Scaring white folks.

12:34.854 --> 12:36.754
I'm hot! Makeup's melting.
It hurts my eyes.

12:37.556 --> 12:40.184
Here? No, no, no, what is this?
You said... You said half a car,

12:40.292 --> 12:41.850
not half a piece of crap, Dad.

12:41.994 --> 12:44.326
When I was your age, I'd have been
happy with four wheels and an engine.

12:44.430 --> 12:45.897
Okay, let me explain
something to you. Okay?

12:45.998 --> 12:47.329
<i>- You ever see 40-Year-Old Virgin?
- Yeah.</i>

12:47.433 --> 12:50.527
Okay, that's what this is.
And this is 50-year-old virgin.

12:50.636 --> 12:52.399
- Okay.
- You want me to live that life?

12:52.505 --> 12:54.700
- No sacrifice, no victory.
- Yeah, no victory. You know, I got it.

12:54.807 --> 12:56.069
- The old Witwicky motto, Dad.
- Right.

12:56.175 --> 12:57.233
Gentlemen.

12:58.310 --> 13:02.110
Bobby Bolivia, like the country,
except without the runs.

13:02.214 --> 13:03.306
How can I help you?

13:03.415 --> 13:06.179
Well, my son here,
looking to buy his first car.

13:07.086 --> 13:09.179
- You come to see me?
- I had to.

13:09.288 --> 13:13.657
That practically makes us family.
Uncle Bobby B, baby. Uncle Bobby B.

13:13.759 --> 13:16.125
- Sam.
- Sam, let me talk to you.

13:16.562 --> 13:21.090
Sam, your first enchilada of freedom
awaits underneath one of those hoods.

13:21.867 --> 13:25.200
Let me tell you something, son.
A driver don't pick the car.

13:25.571 --> 13:27.232
The car'll pick the driver.

13:27.339 --> 13:30.137
It's a mystical bond
between man and machine.

13:30.242 --> 13:33.143
Son, I'm a lot of things,
but a liar's not one of them.

13:33.245 --> 13:37.773
Especially not in front of my mammy.
That's my mammy. Hey, Mammy!

13:39.552 --> 13:42.544
Don't be like that.
If I had a rock, I'd bust your head, bitch.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.714
I tell you, man, she deaf, you know?

13:47.393 --> 13:52.353
Well, over here, every piece of car
a man might want or need.

13:52.464 --> 13:53.897
This ain't bad.

13:55.201 --> 13:57.226
- This one's got racing stripes.
- Yeah.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.667
It got racing...

13:59.305 --> 14:01.170
Yeah, what's this?
What the heck is this?

14:01.273 --> 14:03.036
I don't know nothing about this car.

14:03.142 --> 14:04.370
- Manny!
- What?

14:04.476 --> 14:07.070
What is this? This car! Check it out!

14:07.179 --> 14:09.670
<i>I don't know, boss! I've never seen it!
That's loco!</i>

14:09.782 --> 14:12.273
Don't go Ricky Ricardo on me, Manny!
Find out!

14:12.384 --> 14:13.908
Feels good.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.483
- How much?
- Well,

14:20.359 --> 14:23.453
considering the semi-classic nature
of the vehicle,

14:23.562 --> 14:25.359
with the slick wheels
and the custom paint job...

14:25.464 --> 14:29.525
- Yeah, but the paint's faded.
- Yeah, but it's custom.

14:29.635 --> 14:30.659
It's custom faded?

14:30.769 --> 14:33.533
Well, this is your first car.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

14:33.639 --> 14:36.437
- Five grand.
- No, I'm not paying over four. Sorry.

14:36.842 --> 14:38.434
Kid, come on, get out. Get out the car.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.102
No, no, no.
You said cars pick their drivers.

14:40.212 --> 14:43.409
Well, sometimes they pick a driver
with a cheap-ass father. Out the car.

14:43.515 --> 14:46.678
Now, this one here
for four Gs is a beaut.

14:46.785 --> 14:48.912
There's a Fiesta with racing stripes
over there.

14:49.021 --> 14:51.615
No, I don't want a Fiesta
with racing stripes.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.749
This is a classic engine right here.

14:53.859 --> 14:56.191
I sold a car the other day...

14:58.230 --> 14:59.663
Gee. Holy cow.

14:59.765 --> 15:01.198
- No, no, no. No worries.
- You all right?

15:01.300 --> 15:05.066
I'll get a sledgehammer and knock
this right out. Hey, hey, Manny!

15:05.170 --> 15:06.831
Get your clown cousin
and get some hammers

15:06.939 --> 15:09.066
and come bang this stuff out, baby!

15:10.142 --> 15:11.109
<i>Greater than man...</i>

15:11.210 --> 15:14.304
That one's my favorite,
drove all the way from Alabammy.

15:31.563 --> 15:32.530
$4,000.

15:45.210 --> 15:46.336
Steve.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.345
Hello, Mr. Secretary.

15:50.349 --> 15:51.941
They're so young.

15:52.051 --> 15:54.178
They're the top
subject matter experts, sir.

15:54.286 --> 15:56.550
NSA's recruiting right out of
high school these days.

15:56.655 --> 16:00.022
Guys, that's the Secretary of Defense.

16:01.360 --> 16:03.123
I am so underdressed.

16:03.228 --> 16:06.220
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Secretary of Defense.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.761
Please be seated.

16:11.103 --> 16:12.798
I'm John Keller.

16:12.905 --> 16:16.170
Obviously, you're wondering
why you're here, so these are the facts.

16:17.543 --> 16:19.443
<i>At 1900 local time yesterday,</i>

16:19.545 --> 16:22.742
<i>the SOCCENT Forward Operations
Base in Qatar was attacked.</i>

16:22.948 --> 16:26.213
So far as we know,
there were no survivors.

16:26.585 --> 16:29.918
The objective of the attack
was to hack our military network.

16:30.522 --> 16:32.162
We're not sure
exactly what they're after,

16:32.257 --> 16:35.693
but we do know that
they were cut off during the assault,

16:35.794 --> 16:39.662
which would lead us to assume
that they're going to try it again.

16:40.099 --> 16:43.068
Now, no one's taken responsibility
for the attack.

16:43.168 --> 16:47.161
And the only real lead we have so far
is this sound.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.440
That's the signal
that hacked our network.

16:57.916 --> 17:01.010
NSA's working at full capacity
to analyze it

17:01.120 --> 17:02.600
and intercept further communications,

17:02.688 --> 17:05.486
but we need your help
to find out who did this.

17:05.590 --> 17:09.789
Now, you've all shown considerable
ability in the area of signals analysis.

17:10.262 --> 17:12.492
We're on a hair-trigger here, people.

17:13.065 --> 17:15.192
The President has dispatched
battle groups

17:15.300 --> 17:19.464
<i>to the Arabian Gulf and Yellow Sea.
This is as real as it's ever gonna get.</i>

17:19.570 --> 17:21.198
<i>Now I'm gonna leave you
to your officer-in-charge.</i>

17:21.306 --> 17:24.207
You'll break up into teams
and you'll start your work.

17:24.309 --> 17:25.833
Good luck to us all.

17:35.287 --> 17:38.723
All right, Mojo. I got the car.
Now I need the girl.

17:40.759 --> 17:44.422
I need money to take out the girl
is what I need.

17:44.596 --> 17:45.654
Zero bids.

17:47.132 --> 17:49.430
Great. Broke.

17:49.535 --> 17:51.901
Come on, Mojo.
You want your pain pills?

17:53.906 --> 17:55.203
No. Premature.

17:55.307 --> 17:56.638
Good. What's up?

17:56.742 --> 17:59.575
Nothing. You know, just driving my car.
Driving my car.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.074
It's like clockwork.

18:03.182 --> 18:04.774
All right, I know you get wasted
on these things,

18:04.883 --> 18:07.943
but if you piss in my bed again,
you're sleeping outside. Okay?

18:08.053 --> 18:10.351
That's it for today. No more. Crackhead.

18:10.456 --> 18:14.552
- Ron, this one is uneven.
- Yeah. Probably.

18:14.660 --> 18:15.854
This one is wobbly.

18:15.961 --> 18:20.057
- Yeah. I'll take care of that real soon.
- Couldn't we have hired a professional?

18:20.165 --> 18:21.291
- Sam...
- What?

18:21.400 --> 18:23.960
I do not like footprints on my grass.

18:24.069 --> 18:26.264
- What foot... There's no footprints.
- That's why I built my path.

18:26.371 --> 18:28.066
So why don't you go from my grass
onto my path, okay?

18:28.173 --> 18:30.300
- It's family grass, Dad.
- Well, when you own your own grass,

18:30.409 --> 18:32.502
- you'll understand.
- This... I can't do it anymore.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.704
- You're putting girl jewelry on a boy dog.
- What?

18:34.813 --> 18:36.974
He's got enough self-esteem issues
as a Chihuahua, Mom.

18:37.082 --> 18:38.640
That's his bling.

18:39.017 --> 18:40.951
I want you home at 11:00!

18:41.053 --> 18:42.918
- Yeah, all right.
- 11:00!

18:43.021 --> 18:45.148
Please, for the love of God, drive safely.

18:45.257 --> 18:46.485
Seat belt on!

18:53.432 --> 18:56.458
Wow. You are so cheap.

18:57.736 --> 19:00.569
Well, it's his first car.
Supposed to be like that.

19:05.444 --> 19:10.973
<i>At this time, we can't confirm
whether there were any survivors.</i>

19:11.517 --> 19:12.484
Oh, my God.

19:12.584 --> 19:14.415
<i>Our bases worldwide are, as of now,
at DEFCON Delta,</i>

19:14.520 --> 19:16.647
<i>our highest readiness level.</i>

19:17.956 --> 19:19.685
We're dealing with
a very effective weapons system

19:19.791 --> 19:22.157
that we have not come across before.

19:22.327 --> 19:25.296
<i>But our prayers are with the families
of the brave men and women...</i>

19:25.531 --> 19:27.226
Honey, Daddy's gonna be okay.

19:28.534 --> 19:31.059
I've never seen a weapons system
like this.

19:31.336 --> 19:34.032
The thermal shows this weird aura
around the exoskeleton

19:34.139 --> 19:37.233
like it's cloaked
by some kind of invisible force field.

19:37.409 --> 19:39.639
That's impossible. There's no
such thing as invisible force fields

19:39.745 --> 19:41.906
except in, like, comic book stuff, right?

19:42.014 --> 19:43.414
- Man, I don't know.
- What is that?

19:43.515 --> 19:45.574
My mama, she had the gift, you know?

19:45.684 --> 19:48.653
She saw things. I got the gene, too,

19:49.054 --> 19:52.717
and that thing that attacked us?
I got a feeling it ain't over.

19:53.559 --> 19:55.322
How about you use
those magic voodoo powers

19:55.427 --> 19:57.019
and get us the hell out of here, huh?

19:57.196 --> 20:01.496
When I took that picture,
I think it saw me.

20:03.769 --> 20:05.464
It looked right at me.

20:06.138 --> 20:08.470
All right, we got to get this thing
back to The Pentagon right away.

20:08.574 --> 20:10.007
They got to know what
we're dealing with here.

20:10.108 --> 20:11.439
<i>My radio's fried.</i>

20:11.944 --> 20:14.538
<i>- I got no communication with aerial.
- Hey, Mahfouz.</i>

20:14.646 --> 20:17.615
- How far do you live from here?
- Not far. Just up that Mountain.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.240
- Do they have a phone?
- Yes.

20:19.351 --> 20:21.012
All right, let's hit it.

20:24.456 --> 20:26.788
Dude, are you sure
we're invited to this party?

20:26.892 --> 20:30.760
Of course, Miles.
It's a lake. Public property.

20:32.598 --> 20:33.690
Oh, my God.

20:34.166 --> 20:37.329
Oh, my God, dude, Mikaela's here.
Just don't do anything weird, all right?

20:37.436 --> 20:38.994
- I'm good, right?
- Yeah, you're good.

20:39.104 --> 20:40.071
Okay.

20:43.976 --> 20:46.740
Hey, guys, check it out.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.213
Oh, hi.

20:48.313 --> 20:52.409
Hey, bro. That car. It's nice. Hey.

20:57.556 --> 20:59.615
So, what are you guys doing here?

21:00.325 --> 21:02.225
We're here to climb this tree.

21:02.961 --> 21:04.826
I see that. It looks... It looks fun.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.397
- Yeah.
- You know, I thought I recognized you.

21:06.498 --> 21:09.467
You tried out for the football team
last year, right?

21:11.036 --> 21:12.333
Let's go call your Mom.

21:12.437 --> 21:16.339
Oh, no, no, that... No.
That wasn't like a real tryout.

21:16.441 --> 21:19.137
I was researching a book I was writing.

21:19.244 --> 21:20.541
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

21:20.646 --> 21:23.012
Yeah? What's it about?
Sucking at sports?

21:24.516 --> 21:28.145
No, it's about the link between
brain damage and football.

21:28.253 --> 21:30.483
No, it's a good book.
Your friends'll love it.

21:30.589 --> 21:33.752
You know, it's got mazes in it and,
you know, little coloring areas,

21:33.859 --> 21:36.419
sections, pop-up pictures.
It's a lot of fun.

21:37.062 --> 21:38.222
That's funny.

21:38.897 --> 21:41.024
Okay, okay. You know what? Stop.

21:43.869 --> 21:46.099
Hey, guys, I know of a party.
Let's go, let's head.

21:46.204 --> 21:48.263
You got to get out
of the tree right now. Get...

21:48.373 --> 21:50.967
Just get out of the tree
right now, please.

21:51.910 --> 21:53.104
What are you doing?

21:53.211 --> 21:55.270
Did you see that dismount?
All the chicks were watching.

21:55.380 --> 21:57.814
You're making me look like an idiot.
We both looked like idiots just now.

21:57.916 --> 22:01.181
- Hey, how about you let me drive?
- Oh, no. No, no, no. This is not a toy.

22:01.286 --> 22:04.255
These 22s, I don't want you
grinding them. No.

22:04.356 --> 22:07.348
Why doesn't my little bunny
just hop in the back seat?

22:08.327 --> 22:11.694
God, I can't even tell you how much
I'm not your little bunny.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.299
Okay.

22:15.767 --> 22:17.200
You'll call me.

22:23.608 --> 22:26.509
<i>Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?</i>

22:26.611 --> 22:28.131
Hey, man, what's wrong
with your radio?

22:28.213 --> 22:30.113
- I'm gonna drive her home tonight.
- What?

22:30.215 --> 22:32.843
She's an evil jock concubine, man.
Let her hitchhike.

22:32.951 --> 22:34.578
She lives 10 miles from here, okay?
It's my only chance.

22:34.686 --> 22:35.948
You got to be understanding
here, all right?

22:36.054 --> 22:37.453
All right. We'll put her in the back.
I'll be quiet.

22:37.556 --> 22:39.183
- Did you say, "Put her in the back"?
- I called shotgun.

22:39.291 --> 22:41.088
I'm not putting her in the back.
You got to get out of my car.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.626
- That's a party foul.
- What rules?

22:42.627 --> 22:43.821
Bros before hos.

22:43.929 --> 22:45.692
Miles, I'm begging you to get out
of my car. Okay?

22:45.797 --> 22:46.786
You can't do this to me.

22:46.898 --> 22:48.991
You got to get out of my car right now.

22:52.838 --> 22:56.274
<i>Who's gonna come around
when you break?</i>

22:56.375 --> 22:59.242
Mikaela! It's Sam.

22:59.344 --> 23:00.368
Witwicky.

23:00.879 --> 23:03.040
I hope I didn't get you
stranded or anything.

23:03.148 --> 23:04.115
You sure?

23:04.216 --> 23:05.979
So, listen, I was wondering
if I could ride you home.

23:06.084 --> 23:09.542
I mean, give you a ride home
in my car, to your house.

23:10.589 --> 23:11.783
There you go.

23:18.930 --> 23:19.897
So...

23:23.802 --> 23:26.168
I can't believe that I'm here right now.

23:27.606 --> 23:30.234
You can duck down if you want.
I mean, it won't hurt my feelings.

23:30.342 --> 23:32.367
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't mean here with you.

23:32.477 --> 23:37.710
I just meant here, like, in this situation,
this same situation that I'm always in.

23:37.816 --> 23:40.808
'Cause, I don't know, I guess I just
have a weakness for hot guys,

23:40.919 --> 23:44.446
for tight abs and really big arms.

23:44.923 --> 23:46.117
Big arms?

23:48.093 --> 23:50.857
Well, there's a couple new additions
in the car.

23:50.962 --> 23:53.453
Like, I just put in that light there.

23:54.032 --> 23:57.991
And that disco ball. And so the light
reflects off the disco ball.

23:59.905 --> 24:00.872
Yeah.

24:04.109 --> 24:07.510
Are you new to school this year?
It's your first year here?

24:07.612 --> 24:09.443
Oh, no, no.

24:09.548 --> 24:11.448
We've been in the same school
since first grade.

24:11.550 --> 24:12.847
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:13.251 --> 24:14.582
Yeah, a long time.

24:14.686 --> 24:16.586
Well, do we have any classes together?

24:16.688 --> 24:18.246
- Yeah, yeah.
- Really? Which?

24:18.356 --> 24:21.848
History. Language arts. Math. Science.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.222
- Sam.
- Sam. Yeah.

24:23.328 --> 24:26.764
- Sam Wilkicky.
- Witwicky.

24:26.865 --> 24:28.545
God, you know what? I'm so sorry.
I just...

24:28.633 --> 24:30.328
- No, it's cool.
- I just didn't recognize you.

24:30.435 --> 24:32.869
Yeah, well, I mean,
that's understandable.

24:34.072 --> 24:36.870
No, no, no. No. Come on.

24:38.243 --> 24:40.763
Sorry, I'm just working out the kinks.
You know, it's a new car.

24:41.646 --> 24:44.240
<i>When I get that feeling
I want sexual healing.</i>

24:44.349 --> 24:47.079
This radio is, like, you know...
It's an old radio, too, so...

24:47.185 --> 24:48.880
<i>Sexual healing.</i>

24:48.987 --> 24:51.217
Look, this isn't something that I,
you know...

24:51.323 --> 24:54.292
I can't get this radio to stop.
Look, I wouldn't try this on you.

24:54.392 --> 24:56.894
'Cause this is like a romantic thing
that I'm not trying to do.

24:56.895 --> 24:58.590
Not that you're not worthy
of trying something like this on.

24:58.697 --> 25:00.028
- No, of course not.
- I'm a friend of yours.

25:00.131 --> 25:02.463
I'm not a romantic friend.
Romantic friends do this.

25:02.567 --> 25:05.627
I mean, I'm not that friend.
I mean, we... I could be.

25:06.037 --> 25:07.231
<i>I feel good.</i>

25:07.339 --> 25:08.738
Just pop the hood.

25:09.207 --> 25:12.370
Stupid. Shut up, shut up, shut up.

25:14.813 --> 25:16.041
Whoa, nice headers.

25:16.147 --> 25:17.705
You've got a high-rise
double-pump carburetor.

25:17.816 --> 25:20.216
That's pretty impressive, Sam.

25:20.318 --> 25:21.546
Double-pump?

25:21.653 --> 25:24.349
It squirts the fuel in
so you can go faster.

25:26.424 --> 25:28.119
I like to go faster.

25:28.326 --> 25:32.160
And it looks like
your distributor cap's a little loose.

25:33.398 --> 25:35.093
Yeah? How'd you know that?

25:36.268 --> 25:40.227
My Dad. He was a real grease monkey.
He taught me all about this.

25:40.338 --> 25:43.774
I could take it all apart, clean it,
put it back together.

25:43.875 --> 25:46.070
That's weird.
I just wouldn't peg you for mechanical.

25:46.177 --> 25:47.166
Oh, my God.

25:47.279 --> 25:48.837
Well, you know,
I don't really broadcast it.

25:48.947 --> 25:51.973
Guys don't like it when you know
more about cars than they do.

25:52.083 --> 25:54.711
Especially not Trent. He hates it.

25:54.819 --> 25:57.686
Yeah, no, I'm cool with, you know,
females working on my engine.

25:57.789 --> 25:59.347
I prefer it, actually.

26:00.025 --> 26:02.323
- Okay. You want to fire it up for me?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem.

26:02.427 --> 26:04.622
- Thanks.
- You know, I was thinking.

26:04.729 --> 26:08.165
You know, if Trent's such a jerk,
why do you hang out with him?

26:10.468 --> 26:13.028
You know what? I'm just...
I'm gonna walk.

26:13.138 --> 26:14.799
Good luck with your car.

26:17.242 --> 26:18.266
All right.

26:18.376 --> 26:20.310
Walking's healthy, right?

26:21.479 --> 26:23.674
Oh, God, no, no, no, no, no, no.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.346
Come on, please.
Please, you gotta work for me now.

26:26.451 --> 26:29.284
Don't let her walk away. Come on,
come on, come on. Please, please.

26:29.521 --> 26:33.855
<i>Baby come back
any kind of fool could see.</i>

26:34.059 --> 26:35.219
Hey!

26:35.660 --> 26:40.256
<i>There was something
in everything about you.</i>

26:41.933 --> 26:44.458
<i>Baby come back
you can blame it all on me.</i>

26:44.569 --> 26:45.900
Hey!

26:48.506 --> 26:50.167
Wait a second!

26:50.342 --> 26:53.800
<i>I was wrong
and I just can't live without you.</i>

26:55.413 --> 26:56.971
There it is.

26:57.616 --> 27:01.450
I had fun.
So, you know, thanks for listening.

27:02.020 --> 27:06.184
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- You... You think I'm shallow?

27:07.425 --> 27:10.485
I think you're... No, no, no.

27:10.929 --> 27:15.195
I think there's a lot more
than meets the eye with you.

27:17.168 --> 27:18.135
Okay.

27:19.137 --> 27:20.104
Yeah.

27:20.205 --> 27:22.730
All right, I'll see you at school.

27:22.841 --> 27:23.899
All right.

27:29.814 --> 27:31.281
That's stupid.

27:31.616 --> 27:32.640
That was a stupid line.

27:32.751 --> 27:35.549
"There's more than meets
the eye with you." Stupid.

27:37.956 --> 27:39.321
Oh, God.

27:40.759 --> 27:42.317
Oh, my God. I love my car.

27:53.304 --> 27:58.867
Hey, guys, I think the other team
figured it out. Iran.

27:58.977 --> 28:02.640
Come on, man. This is way too smart
for Iranian scientists.

28:02.747 --> 28:06.513
- Think about it.
- What do you think, kid? Chinese?

28:07.052 --> 28:09.253
No way. This is nothing like
what the Chinese are using.

28:12.857 --> 28:14.722
This is Air Force One.
Level of flight, level three-three-zero.

28:14.826 --> 28:16.885
<i>We will hunt down this enemy.
And when we do,</i>

28:16.995 --> 28:19.190
<i>we'll know just what to do with them.</i>

28:19.698 --> 28:21.893
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.318
<i>Apparently, there are
very few survivors.</i>

28:40.418 --> 28:41.612
Yes, Mr. President?

28:41.720 --> 28:44.655
Yeah, can you wrangle me up
some Ding Dongs, darling?

28:56.801 --> 29:00.862
I joined the Air Force to bring the man
Ding Dongs. I'll be in storage.

29:26.231 --> 29:27.198
Shoot.

29:41.379 --> 29:42.903
Gross.

30:10.108 --> 30:11.769
Do you hear that?

30:14.746 --> 30:16.304
Are you getting this?

30:17.315 --> 30:18.955
I think they're hacking
the network again.

30:34.165 --> 30:37.293
Oh, my God. This is a direct match
to the signal in Qatar.

30:37.402 --> 30:39.233
- Are you running a diagnostic?
- Should I be?

30:39.337 --> 30:41.328
- Yes, you should.
- So I am.

30:52.450 --> 30:54.748
Someone!
They're hacking into Air Force One!

30:54.853 --> 30:56.377
We need a senior analyst.

30:56.487 --> 30:58.352
- I think they're planting a virus.
- A virus?

30:58.456 --> 31:00.981
- It's streaming right now.
- They are planting a virus

31:01.092 --> 31:04.289
and stealing a whole lot of data
from your system at the same time.

31:04.395 --> 31:05.919
Code Red. We have a breach.

31:06.030 --> 31:08.760
Air Force One, someone on board
has breached the military network.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.631
I'm in the cargo hold. Clear. Clear.

31:16.241 --> 31:17.640
- You got to cut the hard lines.
- What?

31:17.742 --> 31:20.870
- Whatever they want, they are getting it.
- Sir?

31:20.979 --> 31:23.675
Permission to take down
the Defense Network.

31:23.781 --> 31:27.774
- Cut all server hard lines now.
- Cut all server hard lines now.

31:49.440 --> 31:52.204
Someone's tampered
with the POTUS mainframe.

31:52.343 --> 31:53.776
What the...

31:59.250 --> 32:01.650
<i>Shots fired in the underdeck.
Repeat, shots fired.</i>

32:01.753 --> 32:04.586
<i>Crew, prepare for emergency descent.</i>

32:22.674 --> 32:24.665
I want our President in that bunker.

32:24.776 --> 32:28.803
And I don't want to discuss a damn
thing other till that becomes reality.

32:28.913 --> 32:32.007
That's our first priority.
That's our only priority right now.

32:32.116 --> 32:33.356
Air Force One is on the ground.

33:37.315 --> 33:39.977
Oh, God. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

33:40.818 --> 33:42.376
That's my car!

33:43.821 --> 33:45.152
No!

33:47.291 --> 33:48.383
No, no, no, no.

33:55.933 --> 33:58.026
Dad, call the cops!

33:59.804 --> 34:02.932
Where you going with my car, buddy?
Where you going?

34:03.041 --> 34:06.772
Hello? 911 emergency!
My car has been stolen!

34:06.878 --> 34:10.335
I'm in pursuit! Right?
I need all units, the whole squadron.

34:10.447 --> 34:13.246
Bring everyone!
No, don't ask me questions, all right?

34:13.351 --> 34:16.013
My father's the head
of the neighborhood watch!

34:48.652 --> 34:50.210
Oh, my God.

35:06.637 --> 35:08.036
My name is Sam Witwicky.

35:08.139 --> 35:12.075
Whoever finds this, my car is alive,
okay? You saw that?

35:12.176 --> 35:14.906
Since this is my last words on Earth,
I just wanna say, Mom, Dad, I love you,

35:15.012 --> 35:17.378
<i>and if you find Busty Beauties
under my bed, it wasn't mine.</i>

35:17.482 --> 35:19.473
I'm holding it for Miles.
No, no, wait that...

35:19.584 --> 35:22.212
Okay, that's not true. It's mine
and Uncle Charles gave it to me.

35:22.320 --> 35:24.288
I'm sorry. Mojo, I love you.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.094
No! No! No! No!

35:41.639 --> 35:43.004
Oh, my God.

35:43.574 --> 35:46.099
No, you're a good dog!
Good dog! Good dog!

35:46.310 --> 35:47.402
Oh, my God.

35:50.715 --> 35:55.414
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey! All right! Oh!
No! No!

35:58.322 --> 35:59.722
Okay. Please, please don't kill me!

35:59.790 --> 36:03.123
I'm sorry! Take the keys!
I don't want them! Car's yours!

36:04.929 --> 36:07.363
Listen, listen, listen.

36:07.465 --> 36:08.796
- Good, you're here.
- Let me see your hands!

36:08.900 --> 36:10.458
- No, no, no! It's not me!
- Let me see your hands.

36:10.568 --> 36:13.628
- The guy's inside.
- Shut up! Walk towards the car.

36:15.573 --> 36:17.302
Put your head on the hood.

36:30.588 --> 36:33.318
Whoever did this finally managed
to infiltrate our defense network,

36:33.424 --> 36:36.059
which is what they tried to do in Qatar,
only this time it worked.

36:36.060 --> 36:37.740
- What did they get?
- We still don't know.

36:37.795 --> 36:40.923
- Talk to me about the virus.
- It's a Spider-bot virus.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.713
We're not sure what it's going to do,
but it may cripple the system.

36:43.768 --> 36:45.768
- Can we stop it?
- Every time we try an antivirus,

36:45.870 --> 36:48.395
it adapts and speeds up.
It's like it's not a virus anymore.

36:48.506 --> 36:49.564
It's become the system.

36:49.674 --> 36:52.837
Obviously the first phase
of a major attack against the US.

36:52.944 --> 36:54.536
The only countries
with this kind of capability

36:54.645 --> 36:56.943
are Russia, North Korea, maybe China.

36:57.048 --> 36:59.983
- I'm sorry, that's not correct.
- Excuse me, young lady.

37:00.084 --> 37:02.314
I didn't see you standing there.
You would be who?

37:02.420 --> 37:04.251
I'm just the analyst
who detected the hack.

37:04.355 --> 37:07.483
Hold on. It was you? You did it?

37:07.858 --> 37:10.622
- Her team.
- Sir, I was just trying to say,

37:10.728 --> 37:13.356
they hacked your firewall in 10 seconds.

37:13.464 --> 37:16.126
Okay. Even a supercomputer
with a brute force attack

37:16.234 --> 37:17.963
would take 20 years to do that.

37:18.069 --> 37:20.537
Maybe you can explain, then,
how our latest satellite imagery

37:20.638 --> 37:22.970
shows North Korea
doubling its naval activity.

37:23.074 --> 37:26.566
Maybe it's a precaution,
because isn't that what we're doing?

37:26.677 --> 37:30.044
The signal pattern is learning.
It's evolving on its own.

37:30.147 --> 37:32.411
And you need to
move past Fourier transfers

37:32.516 --> 37:34.711
and start considering
quantum mechanics.

37:34.819 --> 37:37.151
There is nothing on Earth that complex.

37:37.255 --> 37:39.746
What about an organism?
A living organism?

37:39.857 --> 37:42.257
Maybe some kind of
DNA-based computer?

37:42.360 --> 37:46.023
- And I know that that sounds crazy...
- That's enough. That's enough.

37:46.497 --> 37:49.057
We have six floors of analysts
working on this thing.

37:49.166 --> 37:51.498
Now, if you can find proof to back up
your theory,

37:51.602 --> 37:54.204
I'm gonna be happy to listen to you.
But if you don't get a filter

37:54.205 --> 37:58.141
on that brain-mouth thing, you're gonna
be off the team. You understand?

38:03.614 --> 38:07.050
Look, I can't be any clearer
than how crystal clear I am being.

38:07.952 --> 38:10.318
- It just stood up.
- It just stood up.

38:11.822 --> 38:13.551
Wow. That's really neat.

38:14.558 --> 38:15.786
Okay, chiefie.

38:16.193 --> 38:18.957
Time to fill her up. And no drippy-drippy.

38:19.497 --> 38:20.862
What are you rolling?

38:20.965 --> 38:23.297
Whippets? Goofballs?
A little wowie sauce with the boys?

38:23.401 --> 38:25.767
- No, I'm not on any drugs.
- What's these?

38:26.570 --> 38:29.368
Found it in your pocket. "Mojo."

38:30.641 --> 38:33.235
Is that what the kids are doing now?
Little bit of Mojo?

38:33.344 --> 38:36.973
- Those are my dog's pain pills.
- You know, a Chihuahua. A little...

38:40.951 --> 38:42.213
What was that?

38:43.888 --> 38:47.051
You eyeballing my piece, 50 Cent?

38:48.225 --> 38:51.683
You wanna go?
Make something happen. Do it.

38:51.796 --> 38:54.993
'Cause I promise you I will bust you up.

38:56.367 --> 38:57.629
Are you on drugs?

39:06.210 --> 39:08.440
Let's hope this telephone line works.

39:10.981 --> 39:13.449
Hey, heads up!

39:13.551 --> 39:17.180
Heads up! Hey! Heads up!

39:22.126 --> 39:24.094
What the heck was that?

39:28.766 --> 39:31.098
English, dude. English.

39:37.508 --> 39:38.634
Whoa!

39:39.310 --> 39:40.800
Watch out!

39:47.084 --> 39:49.552
- Open fire!
- Contact! Contact!

39:49.653 --> 39:50.711
Everybody, quiet. Settle.

39:50.821 --> 39:52.948
Whoa, mother... What the hell is...

40:00.698 --> 40:03.462
Get up! Get up! Come on!

40:10.574 --> 40:12.371
Go! Move it!

40:24.655 --> 40:26.782
Take cover!

40:29.160 --> 40:31.151
Fig! Cover the rear!

40:31.796 --> 40:36.699
Cover fire! Move it! Fig, cover the rear!
Epps! Cover the rear! Move it!

40:36.801 --> 40:39.827
Come on! Give me a mag!

40:41.071 --> 40:42.663
Where's your papa?
Where's your papa?

40:42.773 --> 40:43.865
Papa!

40:44.508 --> 40:46.738
Sir, we need... I need a telephone.

40:46.844 --> 40:49.210
- Telephone, telephone, yes!
- Telephone!

40:49.313 --> 40:50.905
Hey, I need a mag! Give me a mag!

40:51.015 --> 40:52.277
- Cell phone!
- I don't know how to thank you.

40:52.383 --> 40:53.350
Fire!

40:54.585 --> 40:57.145
This is an emergency Pentagon call!
I need you to... Do you understand?

40:57.254 --> 40:59.745
It's an emergency Pentagon...

41:01.625 --> 41:03.752
I don't have a credit card!

41:04.228 --> 41:07.959
Sir, the attitude is not going to speed
things up any bit at all.

41:08.065 --> 41:10.761
I'm going to ask you to speak
into the mouthpiece very clearly.

41:10.868 --> 41:15.168
I'm in the middle of a war!
This is frigging ridiculous!

41:16.507 --> 41:17.804
Ammo!

41:18.342 --> 41:20.537
I need a credit card!

41:22.513 --> 41:25.277
- Epps! Where's your wallet?
- Pocket!

41:25.950 --> 41:28.646
- Which pocket?
- My back pocket!

41:28.752 --> 41:32.950
- You got 10 back pockets!
- Left cheek! Left cheek! Left cheek!

41:33.791 --> 41:35.952
All right, keep shooting! Keep shooting!

41:36.060 --> 41:38.051
Okay, it's Visa.

41:38.295 --> 41:39.557
Also, sir, have you heard about

41:39.663 --> 41:41.756
our premium plus
world-service gold package?

41:41.866 --> 41:46.997
No, I don't want a premium package!
Epps! Pentagon!

41:50.007 --> 41:51.269
Give me a status.

41:51.642 --> 41:54.236
Sir, we're tracking a Special Ops team
under fire in Qatar.

41:54.345 --> 41:56.040
They say they're survivors
of the base attack.

41:56.146 --> 41:57.113
Survivors?

42:00.951 --> 42:02.612
I ain't never seen this in my life!

42:02.720 --> 42:04.449
<i>Need gunships on station ASAP!</i>

42:04.555 --> 42:05.749
Predator's coming up in a minute.

42:05.856 --> 42:07.576
We're linking the call
to the nearest AWACS.

42:13.531 --> 42:16.500
Unknown, man. I don't...
Man, if you seen this shit...

42:16.834 --> 42:19.462
Predator ETA two minutes.

42:28.245 --> 42:30.179
Hey! Make way!

42:35.052 --> 42:37.111
- What is that?
- I don't know.

42:42.393 --> 42:44.088
We need air support
and we need it now.

42:44.194 --> 42:47.288
Roll in strike package Bravo
on unknown target.

42:47.398 --> 42:50.993
<i>I authenticate Tango Whiskey
at time 0300 Zulu.</i>

42:51.101 --> 42:53.934
<i>Attention, all aircraft. This will be
a danger close-fire mission.</i>

42:54.038 --> 42:55.562
<i>Weapons, I just got a call
from Falcon Ops.</i>

42:55.673 --> 42:57.368
<i>Who's closer to Kill Box One Alpha?</i>

42:57.474 --> 42:58.998
<i>- Send the Hogs, sir.
- Okay, send the Hogs over</i>

42:59.109 --> 43:00.910
<i>to Kill Box One Alpha.
It's a danger close...</i>

43:00.911 --> 43:03.436
<i>Switch the Hogs to Kill Box One Alpha,
300 feet danger close.</i>

43:03.547 --> 43:05.447
<i>Friendlies in the area.</i>

43:05.549 --> 43:08.575
Seven-man team
north of orange smoke!

43:08.686 --> 43:11.917
Received Kill Box One Alpha.
Engage hostile.

43:14.291 --> 43:17.556
Attack direction west!
You're clear and hot!

43:20.764 --> 43:22.129
<i>Strike, tell me status of Hog right now.</i>

43:22.232 --> 43:24.097
Hog One-One Dark Star status.

43:26.470 --> 43:29.564
- Lennox! The heat's coming!
- Laze the target!

43:29.673 --> 43:32.233
We got a beam-rider incoming!
Laze target!

43:39.617 --> 43:42.211
- Ready! Heat's coming!
- What? Bring it!

43:42.319 --> 43:44.913
<i>Receiving radar jamming
in vicinity of target.</i>

44:01.271 --> 44:03.068
No frigging way
that thing's still not down.

44:03.173 --> 44:06.438
Spooky Three Two, use 105 shells.
Bring the rain.

44:08.646 --> 44:12.082
<i>Be advised, ground team is requesting
105 sabot rounds.</i>

44:40.344 --> 44:41.402
Did we lose them?

44:41.512 --> 44:44.072
<i>Warthog One confirm visual
on friendlies.</i>

44:48.185 --> 44:49.311
Where's Fig?

44:50.254 --> 44:51.846
- Fig? Fig?
- Oh, God!

44:52.823 --> 44:54.620
- God damn it!
- Get a medic!

44:54.725 --> 44:55.817
Get a medic!

44:55.993 --> 44:57.074
- I'm sorry.
- Black Hawk...

44:57.127 --> 44:58.321
We'll get a medic. Just hold on.
He's got a pulse.

44:58.429 --> 45:00.869
We need a medevac. One man down.
Patient care category urgent.

45:06.036 --> 45:07.731
Bring them home.

45:09.139 --> 45:11.505
<i>You get those men stateside right now.</i>

45:12.009 --> 45:13.704
<i>I want them debriefed in 10 hours.</i>

45:20.451 --> 45:23.852
There's only one hacker in the world
who can break this code.

45:34.298 --> 45:36.994
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Wait! Stop!

45:40.104 --> 45:41.799
I am sorry to bother you.

45:42.106 --> 45:43.733
- Maggie?
- Listen, I need your help.

45:43.841 --> 45:47.834
No! This is my private area,
my place of Zen and peace.

45:47.945 --> 45:49.606
- Listen to me.
- Glen! Who is it?

45:49.713 --> 45:51.840
Shut up, Grandma!

45:51.949 --> 45:54.383
- What are you doing here?
- Just give me a break, will you, please?

45:54.485 --> 45:56.578
Grandmama! Drink your prune juice!

46:01.558 --> 46:04.083
- What level are you on, man?
- Six.

46:06.930 --> 46:09.592
Oh, here come the matrix!
Here come the matrix!

46:13.203 --> 46:16.036
Glen, seriously, don't you
want to see something classified?

46:16.140 --> 46:17.971
Yeah. Get low.

46:18.308 --> 46:22.244
- Here we go. Here we go. Double tap.
- Hey, I just paused it. I just paused it.

46:22.346 --> 46:24.177
Hey. I need a moment.

46:25.182 --> 46:26.513
- Please.
- Sorry.

46:27.084 --> 46:28.676
Hey, man, save my game.

46:28.786 --> 46:30.651
How classified?

46:31.989 --> 46:36.050
Like "I will go to jail for the rest of
my life for showing you" classified.

46:36.326 --> 46:38.294
Yes! One quick peek.

46:39.096 --> 46:42.259
Special Ops got a thermal snapshot
of whatever hit the base in Qatar.

46:42.366 --> 46:44.891
- I want to see it.
- Well, the imager was damaged, sir.

46:45.002 --> 46:46.603
The rangers are en route
with the imager,

46:46.670 --> 46:48.570
but we also have a security issue.

46:48.672 --> 46:50.936
Circle logs indicate one of
the analysts made a copy

46:51.041 --> 46:52.702
of the network intrusion signal.

46:55.712 --> 46:59.011
The signal strength is through the roof.
Where did you say you got this?

46:59.116 --> 47:01.448
It hacked the national military
air-guard frequency

47:01.552 --> 47:03.110
in less than a minute.

47:03.220 --> 47:05.415
- No way.
- Yeah.

47:06.890 --> 47:11.327
Looks like there's a message embedded
in the signal. Let me work my magic.

47:17.467 --> 47:19.025
"Project Iceman"?

47:19.136 --> 47:22.537
- What's Sector Seven?
- Who is Captain Witwicky?

47:24.074 --> 47:26.406
Are you playing
those video games again?

47:26.610 --> 47:28.601
Cops! Cops!

47:28.712 --> 47:31.408
FBI! Clear right!

47:33.183 --> 47:35.344
Lock it down! Lock it down!

47:37.054 --> 47:38.021
Cops!

47:38.288 --> 47:39.448
Lock it down.

47:39.556 --> 47:43.048
Wait! I'm just a cousin! I'm just a...

47:44.161 --> 47:47.722
Get off my Grandmama's carpet!
She don't like nobody on the carpet!

47:47.831 --> 47:49.458
Especially police!

47:50.067 --> 47:52.831
<i>It was an awesome spectacle here
an hour ago</i>

47:52.936 --> 47:56.804
<i>when over 40 C-17 s lifted off
of this very base.</i>

47:57.441 --> 47:59.466
<i>We're not told where they're going.</i>

47:59.576 --> 48:00.565
Morning, Mo.

48:00.677 --> 48:02.975
<i>The government has been very quiet
about what's going on but in our...</i>

48:03.080 --> 48:04.707
<i>- Mojo. Mojo.
- They were headed directly</i>

48:04.815 --> 48:06.339
<i>towards North Korea.</i>

48:06.450 --> 48:09.317
Stop with the barking, Mojo.
It's too early. Please?

48:12.923 --> 48:14.686
Miles? Miles, listen to me. Listen.

48:14.791 --> 48:17.817
- My car, it stole itself, okay?
- What are you talking about, man?

48:17.928 --> 48:20.829
Satan's Camaro. In my yard.
It's stalking me.

48:28.705 --> 48:29.729
Stop!

48:29.840 --> 48:31.569
No, no, no, no, no, no.

48:38.081 --> 48:39.207
Oh, my God!

48:40.050 --> 48:41.017
Sam?

48:44.121 --> 48:45.088
Hi.

48:45.389 --> 48:48.654
That was... That was really awesome.

48:48.759 --> 48:50.852
- Well, it felt awesome.
- Are you okay?

48:50.961 --> 48:52.952
I'm not okay, all right?
I'm losing my mind a little bit.

48:53.063 --> 48:54.928
I'm getting chased by my car right now.
I got to go.

48:55.032 --> 48:57.262
You know what?
I'm gonna catch up with you guys later.

49:30.167 --> 49:31.725
Oh, great. Cops.

49:36.840 --> 49:38.034
Officer!

49:39.676 --> 49:41.439
Listen!

49:42.980 --> 49:43.947
Oh, that hurt.

49:46.683 --> 49:48.173
Listen to me!

49:48.285 --> 49:51.152
Thank God you're here!
I've had the worst day ever!

49:51.254 --> 49:54.917
I've been... I've been followed here
on my mother's bike! Right?

49:55.025 --> 49:57.619
And my car's right there
and it's been following me here!

49:57.728 --> 50:04.190
So get out of the car! No! Stop!
Oh, God. Okay, okay! Okay, all right!

50:04.534 --> 50:08.994
Okay! I'm sorry! I'm...
I didn't mean to hit your car! Look!

50:10.307 --> 50:14.175
Okay, look, look, look! Stop, stop!

50:18.348 --> 50:21.112
Please! Okay,
what do you want from me?

50:23.453 --> 50:24.852
Okay.

50:30.394 --> 50:31.861
Oh, God, no! No!

50:33.797 --> 50:39.235
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, shit, shit!
Oh, God! Oh, shit!

50:42.272 --> 50:44.035
It's a bad dream.

50:45.909 --> 50:47.672
Are you username LadiesMan217?

50:47.778 --> 50:48.938
I don't know what you're talking about!

50:49.046 --> 50:51.412
Are you username LadiesMan217?

50:51.515 --> 50:52.641
Yeah.

50:52.749 --> 50:55.183
Where is eBay item 21153?

50:55.285 --> 50:56.980
Where are the glasses?

51:08.565 --> 51:09.827
Get back!

51:10.734 --> 51:11.701
Stop!

51:14.838 --> 51:15.805
God!

51:16.706 --> 51:18.469
What is your problem, Sam?

51:18.575 --> 51:20.566
Okay, there's a monster right there!
It just attacked me!

51:20.677 --> 51:25.114
Here he comes! All right, get up.
Get up and run! You have to run! Okay.

51:32.789 --> 51:33.813
Sam, what is that thing?

51:33.924 --> 51:35.289
- You have to get in the car. Get in.
- I don't want to.

51:35.392 --> 51:37.485
- Get in the car. Trust me. Trust me!
- Sam.

51:37.594 --> 51:41.963
Get in! Go, go, go, go, go.

51:53.577 --> 51:54.908
Go, go, go, go!

51:59.516 --> 52:01.313
Oh, God! We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

52:01.418 --> 52:02.979
No, we're not. No, we're not gonna die.

52:03.086 --> 52:05.384
- Oh, my God!
- Trust me. He's a kick-ass driver!

52:06.022 --> 52:07.421
Oh, my God! No!

52:07.524 --> 52:08.821
We're gonna die!

52:14.865 --> 52:16.230
Oh, my God!

52:33.650 --> 52:34.776
We're locked in.

52:37.287 --> 52:40.723
The car won't start.
At least we ditched the monster, right?

52:46.630 --> 52:47.722
Okay.

52:49.332 --> 52:50.765
Time to start.

53:55.131 --> 53:56.428
He's got me! Oh, God!

54:02.973 --> 54:04.838
He's going to kill me!

54:07.978 --> 54:09.639
No. No, no, no!

54:24.227 --> 54:25.421
Get off!

54:40.076 --> 54:41.100
Kill it! Kill it!

54:41.211 --> 54:42.769
Get it, get it, get it, get it!

54:49.619 --> 54:51.587
Not so tough without a head, are you?

54:57.560 --> 54:58.993
Here, come on.

55:13.843 --> 55:15.310
What is it?

55:16.713 --> 55:18.146
It's a robot.

55:19.549 --> 55:20.846
But like a...

55:20.984 --> 55:24.476
Like a different...
You know, like a super-advanced robot.

55:25.855 --> 55:27.288
It's probably Japanese.

55:27.390 --> 55:29.790
Yeah, it's definitely Japanese.

55:31.394 --> 55:33.089
What are you doing?

55:33.730 --> 55:36.893
I don't think it wants to hurt us.
It would have done that already.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.298
Really? Well, do you speak robot?

55:39.402 --> 55:42.803
Because they just had, like,
a giant droid death match.

55:44.174 --> 55:47.337
- I think it wants something from me.
- What?

55:47.444 --> 55:49.935
Well, 'cause the other one was
talking about my eBay page.

55:50.814 --> 55:53.578
You are the strangest boy
I have ever met.

55:54.084 --> 55:56.245
<i>- Can you talk?
- XM Satellite Radio...</i>

55:56.353 --> 55:59.914
<i>Digital cable brings you...
...Columbia Broadcasting System...</i>

56:00.023 --> 56:01.786
So you... You talk through the radio?

56:01.891 --> 56:04.792
<i>Thank you, you're beautiful.
You're wonderful, you're wonderful.</i>

56:04.894 --> 56:06.885
So, what was that last night?
What was that?

56:06.996 --> 56:08.463
<i>Message from Starfleet, Captain...</i>

56:08.565 --> 56:10.624
<i>Throughout the inanimate vastness
of space...</i>

56:10.734 --> 56:12.702
<i>Angels will rain down
like visitors from heaven! Hallelujah!</i>

56:12.802 --> 56:14.929
Visitors from heaven? What...

56:15.038 --> 56:17.165
What are you,
like, an alien or something?

56:22.979 --> 56:25.470
<i>Any more questions you want to ask?</i>

56:26.149 --> 56:28.310
He wants us to get in the car.

56:29.352 --> 56:30.819
And go where?

56:31.821 --> 56:33.584
Fifty years from now,
when you're looking back at your life,

56:33.723 --> 56:36.783
don't you want to be able to say
you had the guts to get in the car?

57:06.256 --> 57:07.985
This car's a pretty good driver.

57:08.091 --> 57:09.251
I know.

57:11.928 --> 57:13.896
Why don't you go sit in that seat, there?

57:14.030 --> 57:16.191
I'm not going to sit in that seat.
He's driving.

57:16.299 --> 57:17.357
Yeah.

57:18.802 --> 57:20.269
You're right.

57:21.805 --> 57:24.774
- Well, maybe you should sit in my lap.
- Why?

57:25.942 --> 57:29.708
Well, I have the only seat belt here.
You know, safety first.

57:31.781 --> 57:33.180
- Yeah, all right.
- Right?

57:33.283 --> 57:34.841
- Yeah.
- Okay.

57:37.320 --> 57:39.311
There, see? That's better.

57:39.622 --> 57:41.021
- Okay.
- Okay.

57:44.727 --> 57:48.094
You know, that seat belt thing was
a pretty smooth move.

57:49.165 --> 57:50.132
Thank you.

57:51.201 --> 57:53.328
You know what I don't understand?

57:53.436 --> 57:56.496
Why, if he's supposed to be, like,
this super-advanced robot,

57:56.606 --> 57:59.200
does he transform back
into this piece-of-crap Camaro?

58:00.643 --> 58:01.940
Whoa! Whoa!

58:02.045 --> 58:04.809
Oh, see? No. Get...
No, that doesn't work. See?

58:04.914 --> 58:05.972
Move it, you moron!

58:06.082 --> 58:08.107
Great, now... See?

58:09.519 --> 58:10.645
Fantastic.

58:10.753 --> 58:12.618
Now you pissed him off.

58:12.922 --> 58:14.389
That car is sensitive.

58:14.491 --> 58:16.686
I mean, $4000 just drove off.

58:29.839 --> 58:30.931
What?

59:34.704 --> 59:36.069
This is you...

59:41.210 --> 59:43.110
Oh, my God!

59:50.353 --> 59:52.048
Come on, let's go.

59:56.960 --> 01:00:00.157
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen!
Explosions everywhere!

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:03.721
<i>This is easily a hundred times cooler
than Armageddon. I swear to God!</i>

01:00:03.866 --> 01:00:06.061
Fire, fire, fire, fire!

01:00:20.049 --> 01:00:21.676
Whoa! Sweet!

01:00:21.784 --> 01:00:23.911
Oh, dude, I hope this guy's got
asteroid insurance,

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.282
'cause he is so boned!

01:00:29.192 --> 01:00:30.523
What is that?

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:32.652
There's something in the tree, dude.

01:00:32.762 --> 01:00:34.889
No, there's something
in the thing by the tree!

01:00:34.998 --> 01:00:36.599
Could you guys just give me
a space rock?

01:01:11.734 --> 01:01:14.225
Excuse me, are you the tooth fairy?

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:18.838
Hey, sweetheart, what are you doing
out here by yourself?

01:01:18.941 --> 01:01:21.432
Holy God! What happened to the pool?

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:58.168
Are you Samuel James Witwicky,
descendent of Archibald Witwicky?

01:02:59.342 --> 01:03:01.105
They know your name.

01:03:02.044 --> 01:03:03.011
Yeah.

01:03:03.112 --> 01:03:05.546
My name is Optimus Prime.

01:03:05.648 --> 01:03:09.709
We are autonomous robotic organisms
from the planet Cybertron.

01:03:09.819 --> 01:03:13.186
- But you can call us Autobots for short.
- Autobots.

01:03:13.389 --> 01:03:18.656
- What's cracking, little bitches?
- My first lieutenant. Designation, Jazz.

01:03:18.761 --> 01:03:22.288
This looks like a cool place to kick it.

01:03:22.865 --> 01:03:24.833
What is that?
How did he learn to talk like that?

01:03:24.834 --> 01:03:28.429
We've learned Earth's languages
through the World Wide Web.

01:03:29.939 --> 01:03:32.407
My weapons specialist, Ironhide.

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:36.870
- You feeling lucky, punk?
- Easy, Ironhide.

01:03:36.979 --> 01:03:40.210
Just kidding.
I just wanted to show him my cannons.

01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:43.611
Our medical officer, Ratchet.

01:03:43.719 --> 01:03:47.849
The boy's pheromone level suggests
he wants to mate with the female.

01:03:50.259 --> 01:03:53.592
You already know
your guardian, Bumblebee.

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:55.491
Bumblebee, right?

01:03:55.598 --> 01:03:57.293
<i>Check on the rep
Yep, second to none.</i>

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.766
So you're my guardian, huh?

01:03:59.869 --> 01:04:05.068
His vocal processors were damaged
in battle. I'm still working on them.

01:04:09.912 --> 01:04:11.277
Why are you here?

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:16.613
We are here looking for the All Spark.
And we must find it before Megatron.

01:04:16.953 --> 01:04:18.386
Mega-what?

01:04:27.964 --> 01:04:33.561
<i>Our planet was once a powerful empire,
peaceful and just,</i>

01:04:34.637 --> 01:04:39.472
<i>until we were betrayed by Megatron,
leader of the Decepticons.</i>

01:04:40.576 --> 01:04:43.841
<i>All who defied them were destroyed.</i>

01:04:43.946 --> 01:04:50.044
<i>Our war finally consumed the planet,
and the All Spark was lost to the stars.</i>

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:57.016
<i>Megatron followed it to Earth,
where Captain Witwicky found him.</i>

01:04:58.194 --> 01:04:59.889
My grandfather.

01:04:59.996 --> 01:05:04.194
<i>It was an accident
that intertwined our fates.</i>

01:05:07.403 --> 01:05:08.961
Come back!

01:05:11.507 --> 01:05:14.067
I think the dogs have found something.

01:05:15.144 --> 01:05:16.907
The ice is cracking!

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:29.315
Captain! Grab my rope, Captain!

01:05:30.059 --> 01:05:32.050
I'm all right, lads!

01:05:33.229 --> 01:05:35.857
Can we throw you a rope, Captain?

01:05:43.239 --> 01:05:48.336
<i>Megatron crash-landed
before he could retrieve the Cube.</i>

01:05:51.914 --> 01:05:55.372
Men! We've made a discovery!

01:05:55.484 --> 01:05:59.887
<i>He accidentally activated
his navigation system.</i>

01:06:13.469 --> 01:06:19.305
<i>The coordinates to the Cube's location
on Earth were imprinted on his glasses.</i>

01:06:19.408 --> 01:06:21.433
How'd you know about his glasses?

01:06:21.544 --> 01:06:23.774
- EBay.
- EBay.

01:06:23.879 --> 01:06:27.042
If the Decepticons find the All Spark,

01:06:27.183 --> 01:06:32.985
they will use its power to transform
Earth's machines and build a new army.

01:06:33.089 --> 01:06:36.490
And the human race
will be extinguished.

01:06:36.592 --> 01:06:42.053
Sam Witwicky,
you hold the key to Earth's survival.

01:06:45.267 --> 01:06:48.236
Please tell me
that you have those glasses.

01:06:52.174 --> 01:06:55.610
It's like
a self-regenerating molecular armor.

01:06:55.711 --> 01:06:57.702
Look at the scorch Mark
where the sabot round hit.

01:06:57.813 --> 01:06:59.075
Melted right through.

01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:02.378
Hey, aren't sabots hot-loaded for, like,
a 6,000-degree magnesium burn?

01:07:02.518 --> 01:07:04.713
Close to it. It melts tank armor.

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:07.015
So this metal skin must react
to extreme heat.

01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:09.415
- Heads up!
- Oh!

01:07:10.159 --> 01:07:12.821
I thought you said
that thing was dead, man!

01:07:13.229 --> 01:07:16.960
Strap it down! Strap it!
This thing is wicked.

01:07:17.066 --> 01:07:18.397
All right, get on the horn
with Northern Command.

01:07:18.501 --> 01:07:20.765
Tell them that our effective weapon
is high-heat sabot rounds.

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:22.711
Recommend we load them
on all the gunships. Go.

01:07:27.572 --> 01:07:29.267
You want that piece?

01:07:29.374 --> 01:07:32.673
Okay, Maggie, look. Let me break
it down to you how it's gonna happen.

01:07:32.778 --> 01:07:34.837
They gonna come through that door
and be good cop, bad cop.

01:07:34.946 --> 01:07:38.279
Don't fall for that, all right?
That's why I ate their food.

01:07:38.383 --> 01:07:40.943
See, they put the plate of donuts
out here to test your guilt.

01:07:41.052 --> 01:07:43.520
If you don't touch it, you're guilty.

01:07:43.622 --> 01:07:47.456
I ate the whole plate.
The whole plate. Okay?

01:07:47.559 --> 01:07:48.719
It's me and you.

01:07:48.827 --> 01:07:51.660
They walk through that door,
you don't say nothing.

01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:08.736
She did it! She did it!
She's the one you want! All right?

01:08:08.847 --> 01:08:10.474
I was just sitting at home
watching cartoons,

01:08:10.582 --> 01:08:12.573
playing video games with my cousin,
and she came in there.

01:08:12.684 --> 01:08:13.651
- And then...
- Glen, you freak.

01:08:13.752 --> 01:08:15.982
Hey! I am not going to jail for you
or anybody else!

01:08:16.087 --> 01:08:20.786
I have done nothing bad my entire life!
Hey, man, I'm still a virgin.

01:08:20.892 --> 01:08:21.859
Okay, so what?

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:24.053
I've downloaded a couple of
thousand songs off the Internet.

01:08:24.162 --> 01:08:25.857
Who hasn't? Who hasn't?

01:08:25.964 --> 01:08:26.930
- I promise!
- Glen, shut up!

01:08:27.032 --> 01:08:30.866
No, you shut up! Don't talk to me!
Don't talk to me, criminal!

01:08:33.171 --> 01:08:35.264
- Oh, sugar rush.
- This is... This is not his fault.

01:08:35.372 --> 01:08:36.965
See? So can I go home now?

01:08:37.075 --> 01:08:39.305
- Oh, okay. I won't.
- But just listen to me.

01:08:39.411 --> 01:08:43.108
Okay, whoever hacked into your military
system downloaded a file, all right?

01:08:43.215 --> 01:08:45.546
It was something about
someone named Witwicky

01:08:45.649 --> 01:08:49.245
and some government group, right?
Named Sector Seven.

01:08:49.354 --> 01:08:51.082
You have to let me talk to
Defense Secretary Keller

01:08:51.189 --> 01:08:53.487
before you go to war
with the wrong country!

01:08:53.591 --> 01:08:56.425
<i>Whatever fell out of the sky
ended up right behind...</i>

01:08:56.528 --> 01:08:58.120
- What did he say?
- What?

01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:59.697
- Did he hear it, too?
- Yeah, Jack heard it, too. Yeah.

01:08:59.798 --> 01:09:02.466
- What does he think it is?
- He thinks it's a military experiment.

01:09:02.466 --> 01:09:04.707
- What a knucklehead.
- Yeah, well, I think it's a plane.

01:09:09.241 --> 01:09:11.072
<i>Still no official word as to
what happened. You can see...</i>

01:09:11.176 --> 01:09:12.370
<i>- Yeah!
- Call Sam.</i>

01:09:12.477 --> 01:09:14.035
- Yeah. Why?
- He should be home in 15 minutes.

01:09:14.145 --> 01:09:15.546
Well, I'll call him in 15 minutes.

01:09:15.546 --> 01:09:18.072
If you wait 15 minutes, he'll be late
and you'll have to ground him.

01:09:18.183 --> 01:09:20.103
Well, I can't ground him
if he's not late, can I?

01:09:25.090 --> 01:09:26.523
I need you to stay here, all right?

01:09:26.625 --> 01:09:27.785
You got to stay here
and you're gonna watch them.

01:09:27.893 --> 01:09:28.859
- Okay, okay.
- All of them.

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:29.948
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- Yeah, okay, okay.

01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:31.028
Five minutes, all right?

01:09:31.729 --> 01:09:34.698
- Thanks for staying on my path.
- Oh, yeah. No, no, Dad. Hey!

01:09:34.799 --> 01:09:36.767
The... Oh, the path. I'm sorry.
I forgot about the path.

01:09:36.868 --> 01:09:38.495
I'm gonna sweep the whole thing
right now. How about that?

01:09:38.603 --> 01:09:40.901
- You know, I buy half your car...
- Yeah.

01:09:41.006 --> 01:09:44.669
Then I bail you out of jail and then
I just decided to do all your chores.

01:09:44.776 --> 01:09:46.377
- The chores.
- Yeah. Life is great, huh?

01:09:46.444 --> 01:09:49.310
Life... Life is fantastic,
is how good it is.

01:09:49.413 --> 01:09:51.974
It's so... Oh, the trash cans. Sorry, Dad.
I'm gonna do the trash cans now.

01:09:52.082 --> 01:09:53.175
No, no, I don't want you
to strain yourself.

01:09:53.285 --> 01:09:54.752
No, no, I won't strain myself, Dad.

01:09:54.853 --> 01:09:56.320
- I'll do it.
- It would hurt my feelings if you do it.

01:09:56.421 --> 01:09:57.786
- You sure? I don't mind, I don't...
- I promise...

01:09:57.889 --> 01:09:59.117
No, no, no, I'm gonna do it.

01:09:59.224 --> 01:10:01.124
I'm gonna do the trash cans
and I'm gonna scrape the grill

01:10:01.226 --> 01:10:05.094
and I'm gonna... I'm gonna sweep up
the whole house right now.

01:10:05.196 --> 01:10:07.562
- Tonight, right now?
- Right now.

01:10:07.666 --> 01:10:08.633
The...

01:10:10.602 --> 01:10:13.070
I love you. God, I love you

01:10:13.171 --> 01:10:14.900
just so much right now.

01:10:15.006 --> 01:10:16.486
You know,
Mom wanted me to ground you.

01:10:16.541 --> 01:10:18.065
- You're three minutes late.
- Right?

01:10:18.176 --> 01:10:20.110
Oh, well, just another thing
you did for me, Dad,

01:10:20.111 --> 01:10:21.476
because you're such a swell guy.

01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:22.706
One more thing, huh?

01:10:22.814 --> 01:10:25.874
All right, I love you!
Sleep good, handsome man!

01:10:26.918 --> 01:10:28.078
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:10:28.219 --> 01:10:31.484
No, watch the path! Watch the path!
Watch the... Please, please, please.

01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:34.457
No, no, wait. No, no, no! Oh, no!

01:10:34.559 --> 01:10:36.993
- Sorry. My bad.
- Oh, I... You couldn't...

01:10:37.095 --> 01:10:39.063
You couldn't wait for five...
You couldn't wait for five minutes?

01:10:39.164 --> 01:10:41.997
I told you to just stay! Just stay! God!

01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:47.261
- I told you to watch them. I told you.
- Okay, you know what?

01:10:47.372 --> 01:10:51.365
- They seem to be in a little bit of a rush.
- Oh, this is bad. No!

01:10:52.677 --> 01:10:55.043
Mojo, Mojo! Off the robot! God!

01:10:55.647 --> 01:10:58.172
- Oh, wet.
- No, no, no, no, no! Easy! Easy!

01:10:58.283 --> 01:11:01.047
Hold on! Hold! This is Mojo.
This is Mojo. He's a pet of mine.

01:11:01.152 --> 01:11:03.950
He's a pet. Okay? That's all.
If you could just put the guns away...

01:11:04.055 --> 01:11:07.024
- Put the... Put them away. Please.
- You have a rodent infestation.

01:11:07.125 --> 01:11:08.319
- A what?
- Shall I terminate?

01:11:08.426 --> 01:11:10.587
No, no, no, no.
He's not a rodent, he's a Chihuahua.

01:11:10.695 --> 01:11:13.892
This is my... This is my Chihuahua.
We love Chihuahuas! Don't we?

01:11:13.999 --> 01:11:16.695
He's leaked lubricants all over my foot.

01:11:18.203 --> 01:11:22.367
- He peed on you? Bad Mojo. Bad Mojo!
- Bad Mojo!

01:11:22.474 --> 01:11:23.964
I'm sorry.
He's got a male dominance thing.

01:11:24.075 --> 01:11:25.633
That's all it is.

01:11:25.744 --> 01:11:28.542
- My foot's gonna rust.
- All right.

01:11:29.581 --> 01:11:30.946
Okay, okay.

01:11:32.150 --> 01:11:34.778
- Shut up and go hide!
- Just hurry.

01:11:37.989 --> 01:11:39.547
Autobots, recon.

01:11:41.493 --> 01:11:44.087
I hope he's okay. He's in the kitchen.

01:11:44.195 --> 01:11:45.958
Got some ice on his nose.

01:11:46.064 --> 01:11:48.498
I had to slap him around a little bit.

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:49.965
You did not.

01:11:51.236 --> 01:11:53.363
- You didn't even ground him.
- Almost, almost.

01:11:54.105 --> 01:11:56.665
Where are they? No, no, no, no, no.

01:11:58.743 --> 01:12:00.370
Come on, come on.

01:12:05.183 --> 01:12:08.277
- What? What is this?
- Time is short.

01:12:08.386 --> 01:12:10.980
- They really want those glasses.
- Come on. What are you doing?

01:12:11.089 --> 01:12:12.750
- I'm gonna help you.
- Okay.

01:12:12.857 --> 01:12:14.848
- Please hurry.
- Okay.

01:12:16.227 --> 01:12:18.218
- Yeah, no, no. It's definitely gone.
- What do you mean?

01:12:18.329 --> 01:12:19.410
My glasses were in the bag.

01:12:19.464 --> 01:12:21.295
They were in the backpack
and now the backpack isn't here.

01:12:21.399 --> 01:12:22.957
Well, they're gonna be pissed,
so what do you wanna do?

01:12:23.068 --> 01:12:24.126
So what I think you should do is
you should...

01:12:24.235 --> 01:12:26.430
You should check this whole...
This whole section here.

01:12:26.538 --> 01:12:29.473
Just give it a clean sweep,
and I'll get the corner here.

01:12:29.574 --> 01:12:32.014
Yeah, no, no, no. Not there.
That's my... That's my private...

01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:33.590
- Sorry. That's nothing.
- You just...

01:12:33.645 --> 01:12:34.612
- You just told me to look...
- I know,

01:12:34.713 --> 01:12:36.078
but I didn't mean to look inside
of my treasure chest.

01:12:36.181 --> 01:12:38.982
You should be way more specific
so I don't get in trouble in your room.

01:12:38.983 --> 01:12:40.917
I'm already stressed out enough.

01:12:41.019 --> 01:12:42.509
Okay. What now?

01:12:44.923 --> 01:12:48.359
No. No, no. No, no, no.

01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:52.419
This isn't hiding. This isn't hiding.
This is my backyard, not a truck stop.

01:12:52.530 --> 01:12:53.519
Oh, God. Oh!

01:12:53.631 --> 01:12:57.761
<i>Okay, I saw it. The UFO landed
right here and now it's gone.</i>

01:12:57.869 --> 01:13:00.167
<i>My moped's under there, man!
Who's gonna pay for that?</i>

01:13:01.639 --> 01:13:03.368
Sam? Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam.

01:13:03.475 --> 01:13:06.410
- He's back here.
- I can't deal with this. I can't...

01:13:06.511 --> 01:13:08.103
What? Oh, no, no, no.

01:13:08.213 --> 01:13:09.271
- This is my mother's flower...
- Oops.

01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:10.608
Okay, listen. You got to listen to me.

01:13:10.715 --> 01:13:12.706
If my parents come out here
and see you, they're gonna freak out.

01:13:12.817 --> 01:13:14.284
My mother's got a temper, okay?

01:13:14.385 --> 01:13:15.943
We must have the glasses.

01:13:16.054 --> 01:13:17.612
I know you need the glasses.
I've been looking everywhere.

01:13:17.722 --> 01:13:19.952
They're not here.
They're definitely not here.

01:13:20.058 --> 01:13:21.150
Keep searching.

01:13:21.259 --> 01:13:22.920
I need you to be quiet for five minutes.

01:13:23.027 --> 01:13:24.255
Ten minutes. Okay?

01:13:24.362 --> 01:13:26.125
Please, I'm begging you. You got to...
You're making a racket.

01:13:26.231 --> 01:13:28.222
I can't concentrate.
You want me to look and I'm hearing...

01:13:28.333 --> 01:13:29.357
Calm down, calm down.

01:13:29.467 --> 01:13:31.162
You got to do something here.
You got to do something here.

01:13:31.269 --> 01:13:33.931
- Autobots, fall back.
- Thank you. Please, for five minutes.

01:13:34.038 --> 01:13:35.903
Good? Good? Okay.

01:13:36.007 --> 01:13:37.167
- Move!
- Get away!

01:13:37.275 --> 01:13:38.970
What's the matter with you?
Can't you be quiet?

01:13:39.077 --> 01:13:40.977
He wants us to be quiet.

01:13:44.816 --> 01:13:48.616
Earthquake! Move, move, move, move,
move! Earthquake!

01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:52.583
Judy! Judy, get under the table! Move it!
Duck and cover right now!

01:13:52.690 --> 01:13:54.521
How did you get over there so fast?

01:13:55.593 --> 01:13:57.356
Wow! That was tingly!

01:13:57.996 --> 01:14:00.863
- You got to try that!
- Yeah, that looks fun.

01:14:05.737 --> 01:14:07.728
- Sam?
- Sammy?

01:14:10.141 --> 01:14:12.837
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

01:14:13.642 --> 01:14:15.371
- Sam?
- That's weird.

01:14:15.511 --> 01:14:17.206
- Sam!
- Ratchet, point the light.

01:14:17.312 --> 01:14:19.872
- Come on, hurry.
- Listen, we got a major issue in here.

01:14:19.982 --> 01:14:21.040
What's with the light?
You gotta stop the light.

01:14:21.150 --> 01:14:23.050
What's going on? Turn it off.
You gotta tell him to shut it off.

01:14:23.152 --> 01:14:24.312
- Shut it off.
- Sam, are you in there?

01:14:24.419 --> 01:14:25.500
How come the door's locked?

01:14:25.587 --> 01:14:29.216
You know the rules.
No doors locked in my house!

01:14:29.324 --> 01:14:30.518
You know he'll start counting

01:14:30.626 --> 01:14:32.025
- if you don't open the door!
- One more chance. Five...

01:14:32.127 --> 01:14:33.116
Oh, dear.

01:14:33.228 --> 01:14:34.957
- Four. It's coming off the hinges, pal.
- He's counting!

01:14:35.097 --> 01:14:36.462
- Sam, just open the door.
- Three.

01:14:36.565 --> 01:14:37.532
- Oh, my.
- Two.

01:14:37.633 --> 01:14:39.692
- He's counting.
- Stand back.

01:14:40.202 --> 01:14:43.865
- What's up? What's with the bat?
- Who were you talking to?

01:14:43.972 --> 01:14:46.964
- I'm talking to you.
- Why are you so sweaty and filthy?

01:14:47.075 --> 01:14:48.667
I'm a child. You know, I'm a teenager.

01:14:48.777 --> 01:14:51.112
We heard voices and noises
and we thought maybe you were...

01:14:51.113 --> 01:14:52.978
It doesn't matter what we thought.
What was that light?

01:14:53.081 --> 01:14:54.878
No, what light? What?
There's no light, Dad! There's no light!

01:14:54.983 --> 01:14:56.473
You got two lights in your hand!
That's what it is.

01:14:56.585 --> 01:14:57.847
- Maybe it bounced...
- There was light under the door.

01:14:57.953 --> 01:14:59.978
Look, you can't... You can't just bounce
into my room like that.

01:15:00.088 --> 01:15:01.453
You got to knock.
You got to communicate.

01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:02.579
- We knocked for five minutes.
- I'm a teenager.

01:15:02.691 --> 01:15:04.056
- We knocked.
- You didn't knock.

01:15:04.159 --> 01:15:05.726
- You were screaming at me, okay?
- No.

01:15:05.727 --> 01:15:07.160
This is repression,
what you're doing here.

01:15:07.262 --> 01:15:09.628
- You're ruining my youth, okay?
- Oh, for Pete's sakes!

01:15:09.731 --> 01:15:14.191
You are so defensive!
Were you masturbating?

01:15:16.071 --> 01:15:17.129
- Judy.
- Was I...

01:15:17.239 --> 01:15:18.239
- No, Mom.
- Zip it, okay?

01:15:18.307 --> 01:15:19.638
- It's okay.
- No, I don't masturbate!

01:15:19.741 --> 01:15:20.765
That's not something for you
to bring up.

01:15:20.876 --> 01:15:22.400
- That's a father-and-son thing, okay?
- Father-son thing.

01:15:22.511 --> 01:15:25.344
I mean, you don't have to call it that
word if that makes you uncomfortable.

01:15:25.447 --> 01:15:29.076
You can call it Sam's happy time or...

01:15:29.184 --> 01:15:31.175
- Happy time?
- ...my special alone time...

01:15:31.286 --> 01:15:32.253
- Stop.
- Mom.

01:15:32.354 --> 01:15:33.343
- Judy, stop.
- ...with myself.

01:15:33.455 --> 01:15:34.479
- Mom, you can't come in and...
- I'm sorry.

01:15:34.590 --> 01:15:36.991
It's just been a weird night.
I've had a little bit to drink.

01:15:36.992 --> 01:15:39.017
- No, no, Dad.
- Yeah, well, we saw a light.

01:15:39.127 --> 01:15:40.890
Oh, parents.

01:15:41.797 --> 01:15:44.595
I don't know where it was, but we saw it.

01:15:45.734 --> 01:15:49.295
Earthquake! It's another one! Another
earthquake! Get in the doorway!

01:15:49.404 --> 01:15:52.037
- Okay!
- Aftershock! Aftershock!

01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:53.129
Oh, I hate these.

01:15:53.242 --> 01:15:54.504
- Got to ride it out. Ride it out!
- Quick, hide.

01:15:54.610 --> 01:15:55.634
- Hey, the lights are back on.
- Hide? What?

01:15:55.744 --> 01:15:57.305
- Where?
- Come on, get out of that tub.

01:15:57.379 --> 01:15:58.710
Can't you take safety seriously?

01:15:58.814 --> 01:16:02.079
- Good Lord, this floor is filthy, Sam.
- Oh, oh, man! Man. Oh.

01:16:02.184 --> 01:16:05.085
Oh, no! Look at the yard.
The yard is destroyed.

01:16:10.192 --> 01:16:13.684
Judy? Better call the city.
We got a blown transformer!

01:16:13.795 --> 01:16:16.286
Power pole's sparking all over
the place!

01:16:16.398 --> 01:16:18.628
Oh, man. Yard's a waste.

01:16:18.734 --> 01:16:20.429
Trashed. Gone.

01:16:20.736 --> 01:16:22.203
- It's a wash. The whole yard.
- You're kidding.

01:16:22.304 --> 01:16:24.329
The parents are very irritating.

01:16:24.439 --> 01:16:26.134
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Can I take them out?

01:16:26.241 --> 01:16:28.971
Ironhide, you know
we don't harm humans.

01:16:29.077 --> 01:16:30.271
What is with you?

01:16:30.379 --> 01:16:33.712
Well, I'm just saying we could.
It's an option.

01:16:33.815 --> 01:16:35.476
We heard you talking
to somebody, Sam.

01:16:35.584 --> 01:16:37.984
- We wanna know who.
- Mom, I told...

01:16:38.086 --> 01:16:39.883
Hi. I'm Mikaela.

01:16:40.656 --> 01:16:42.920
I'm a... I'm a friend of Sam's.

01:16:44.393 --> 01:16:47.123
Gosh, you're gorgeous.
Isn't that the prettiest girl?

01:16:47.229 --> 01:16:50.096
- She can hear you talking, Mom.
- Thank you.

01:16:50.198 --> 01:16:53.367
Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry you had to
hear our little family discussion about...

01:16:53.368 --> 01:16:54.858
- Sorry that we're bugging you.
- Do you have my backpack?

01:16:54.970 --> 01:16:57.010
- Come on, hon. Let's go.
- Oh, it's in the kitchen.

01:17:13.488 --> 01:17:16.821
Oh, yes. Okay. Okay.

01:17:16.925 --> 01:17:18.916
- Yeah.
- Your Mom's so nice.

01:17:19.027 --> 01:17:19.994
I want you to distract my parents

01:17:20.095 --> 01:17:22.393
while I slip out and get these glasses
to them, okay?

01:17:28.337 --> 01:17:30.897
- Ronald Wickity?
- It's Witwicky. Who are you?

01:17:31.006 --> 01:17:33.031
We're the government. Sector Seven.

01:17:33.141 --> 01:17:35.268
- Never heard of it.
- Never will.

01:17:35.377 --> 01:17:37.902
Your son's the great-grandson
of Captain Archibald Wickity, is he not?

01:17:38.013 --> 01:17:39.139
It's Witwicky.

01:17:39.247 --> 01:17:42.478
May I enter the premises, sir?

01:17:42.584 --> 01:17:45.519
Ron, there's guys all over the front yard.

01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:46.587
What the heck is going on here?

01:17:46.688 --> 01:17:48.815
Your son filed a stolen car report
last night.

01:17:48.924 --> 01:17:51.188
We think it's involved in
a national security matter.

01:17:51.293 --> 01:17:52.726
- They're ripping up my Rose bushes!
- National security?

01:17:52.828 --> 01:17:53.886
That's right. National security.

01:17:53.996 --> 01:17:55.588
My God, Ron, they're everywhere.

01:17:55.697 --> 01:17:58.063
There's guys in suits all around
the house! Look at this!

01:17:58.166 --> 01:17:59.963
Could you stay off the grass?

01:18:00.068 --> 01:18:01.501
Get me a sample
and some isotope readings.

01:18:01.603 --> 01:18:03.230
They're pulling bushes out
of the ground!

01:18:03.338 --> 01:18:06.569
Good Lord! They've got to get
their hands off my bush!

01:18:06.675 --> 01:18:08.142
- Drop the bat, ma'am.
- Hey, hey, hey, that's my...

01:18:08.243 --> 01:18:09.574
I'm carrying a loaded weapon.

01:18:09.678 --> 01:18:11.009
But you'd better get those guys
out of my garden

01:18:11.113 --> 01:18:13.274
or I am gonna beat the crap out of them!

01:18:13.382 --> 01:18:16.408
Are you experiencing any flu-like
symptoms? Aching joints? Fever?

01:18:16.518 --> 01:18:18.577
- No!
- What is this?

01:18:18.687 --> 01:18:21.417
How you doing, son?
Is your name Sam?

01:18:21.523 --> 01:18:22.990
- Yeah.
- Well, I need you to come with us.

01:18:23.091 --> 01:18:24.319
Whoa, way out of line.

01:18:24.426 --> 01:18:28.453
Sir, I am asking politely. Back off.

01:18:28.563 --> 01:18:30.463
- You're not taking my son.
- Really?

01:18:30.565 --> 01:18:31.623
You gonna try to get rough with us?

01:18:31.733 --> 01:18:32.973
No, but I'm gonna call the cops

01:18:33.035 --> 01:18:35.230
because there's something fishy
going on around here.

01:18:35.337 --> 01:18:38.033
Yeah. There's something a little fishy
about you, your son,

01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:42.099
your little Taco Bell dog and this
whole operation you got going on here.

01:18:42.210 --> 01:18:44.440
- What operation?
- That is what we are gonna find out.

01:18:44.546 --> 01:18:47.106
I think direct contact.

01:18:52.554 --> 01:18:54.112
- Son?
- Yeah.

01:18:55.190 --> 01:18:58.091
- Step forward, please.
- Just stand?

01:19:03.865 --> 01:19:05.332
Fourteen rads.

01:19:06.935 --> 01:19:08.402
Bingo! Tag them and bag them!

01:19:09.137 --> 01:19:11.037
If you hurt my dog, I'll kick your ass!

01:19:11.139 --> 01:19:12.834
Get me a sample on
that vegetation ASAP!

01:19:12.941 --> 01:19:14.465
Sam! Do not say anything, Sam!

01:19:14.576 --> 01:19:16.441
- Yeah.
- Not a word until we get a lawyer!

01:19:20.715 --> 01:19:21.875
So,

01:19:23.318 --> 01:19:26.776
LadiesMan217.

01:19:26.888 --> 01:19:30.324
That is your eBay username, right?

01:19:30.425 --> 01:19:32.757
Yeah, but, you know,
it was a typo and I ran with it.

01:19:32.861 --> 01:19:33.861
What do you make of this?

01:19:33.929 --> 01:19:36.489
<i>My name is Sam Witwicky, okay?
And my...</i>

01:19:36.598 --> 01:19:37.724
Is that you?

01:19:37.833 --> 01:19:40.028
Yeah, that sounds like LadiesMan.

01:19:40.135 --> 01:19:44.970
Last night at the station, you told
the officer your car transformed.

01:19:46.308 --> 01:19:48.640
- Enlighten me.
- Well, here's what I said, okay?

01:19:48.743 --> 01:19:53.203
'Cause this is a total misunderstanding
that my car had been stolen...

01:19:53.315 --> 01:19:55.442
- Really?
- ...from me, from my home,

01:19:55.550 --> 01:19:58.519
but it's fine now because it's back!
It came back!

01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:00.349
- Well, not by itself.
- Well, no.

01:20:00.455 --> 01:20:03.891
Because cars don't do that
because that would be crazy.

01:20:07.028 --> 01:20:08.620
That's funny. That is so funny.

01:20:08.730 --> 01:20:11.221
So what do you kids know
about aliens, huh?

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:15.164
<i>Oh, you mean, like a Martian?
Like what, E. T? No.</i>

01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:16.760
- It's an urban legend.
- Yeah.

01:20:16.872 --> 01:20:17.998
You see this?

01:20:18.106 --> 01:20:20.700
This is an I-can-do-whatever-I-want
and-get-away-with-it badge.

01:20:20.809 --> 01:20:23.573
- Right.
- I'm gonna lock you up forever.

01:20:23.678 --> 01:20:24.906
Oh, God. You know what?
Don't listen to him.

01:20:25.013 --> 01:20:27.413
He's just pissy 'cause he's got to
get back to guarding the mall.

01:20:27.516 --> 01:20:30.576
You, in the training bra, do not test me.

01:20:30.685 --> 01:20:32.778
Especially with your Daddy's parole
coming up.

01:20:32.888 --> 01:20:34.287
What? Parole?

01:20:34.389 --> 01:20:37.722
- It's nothing.
- Oh, Grand Theft Auto, that ain't nothing?

01:20:37.826 --> 01:20:39.826
You know those cars my Dad
used to teach me to fix?

01:20:39.928 --> 01:20:41.657
Well, they... They weren't always his.

01:20:41.763 --> 01:20:42.855
You stole cars?

01:20:42.964 --> 01:20:44.765
Well, we couldn't always afford
a babysitter,

01:20:44.766 --> 01:20:46.563
so sometimes he had to take me along.

01:20:46.668 --> 01:20:48.966
She's got her own juvie record
to prove it!

01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:51.698
She's a criminal. Criminals are hot.

01:20:52.841 --> 01:20:57.471
That'd be a real shame if he had to rot
in jail the rest of his natural life.

01:20:57.579 --> 01:20:59.877
It is time to talk!

01:21:06.621 --> 01:21:08.054
Big! It's big!

01:21:12.794 --> 01:21:14.762
Go, go, go, go!

01:21:15.197 --> 01:21:17.825
- I can't see it! I can't see it!
- Shift your weight towards the front!

01:21:17.933 --> 01:21:19.366
All right! All right!

01:21:33.949 --> 01:21:36.247
You A-holes are in trouble now.

01:21:36.351 --> 01:21:42.881
Gentlemen, I want to introduce you
to my friend, Optimus Prime.

01:21:45.126 --> 01:21:48.892
Taking the children was a bad move.

01:21:48.997 --> 01:21:52.398
Autobots, relieve them of their weapons.

01:21:56.004 --> 01:21:57.733
Freeze!

01:21:58.373 --> 01:21:59.772
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Give me those!

01:21:59.874 --> 01:22:00.932
Whoa!

01:22:02.377 --> 01:22:03.435
Whoa!

01:22:14.222 --> 01:22:15.553
Hi, there.

01:22:15.857 --> 01:22:20.590
You don't seem afraid.
Are you not surprised to see us?

01:22:21.296 --> 01:22:26.233
Look, there are
Seven protocols, okay?

01:22:26.835 --> 01:22:28.132
I'm not authorized
to communicate with you

01:22:28.236 --> 01:22:30.466
except to tell you
I can't communicate with you.

01:22:30.572 --> 01:22:33.166
- Get out of the car.
- All right.

01:22:33.808 --> 01:22:34.934
- Me? You want me to get...
- Now!

01:22:35.043 --> 01:22:36.533
All right, all right. Get out. Hey.

01:22:36.645 --> 01:22:40.012
All right, I'm... I'm getting out.
I'm getting out. You see?

01:22:40.115 --> 01:22:43.607
Very nifty how you put us down
without really killing us.

01:22:43.718 --> 01:22:45.242
You're good with handcuffs, too,
now, huh?

01:22:45.353 --> 01:22:46.342
How you doing?

01:22:46.454 --> 01:22:48.183
- You weren't supposed to hear all that.
- How's it going, huh?

01:22:48.290 --> 01:22:50.451
- Yeah.
- This is real.

01:22:50.558 --> 01:22:53.721
Now, listen. If I choose to engage
with him, mum is the word, all right?

01:22:53.828 --> 01:22:57.594
Sam, I have a record
because I wouldn't turn my Dad in.

01:22:58.199 --> 01:23:02.363
When have you had to sacrifice
anything in your perfect little life?

01:23:03.938 --> 01:23:05.599
Big guys. Big guys with big guns, huh?

01:23:05.707 --> 01:23:08.574
What is Sector Seven? Answer me.

01:23:08.677 --> 01:23:11.168
I'm the one who asks questions
around here. Not you, young man!

01:23:11.279 --> 01:23:13.509
- How'd you know about the aliens?
- Where did you take my parents?

01:23:13.615 --> 01:23:15.606
- I am not at liberty to discuss it.
- No?

01:23:15.717 --> 01:23:17.582
Hey. You touch me,
that's a federal offense.

01:23:17.686 --> 01:23:19.415
Do-whatever-you-want
and-get-away-with-it badge, right?

01:23:19.521 --> 01:23:22.354
Yeah. Brave now all of a sudden, with
his big alien friend standing over there.

01:23:22.457 --> 01:23:25.654
- Where is Sector Seven?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

01:23:30.932 --> 01:23:31.899
Hey!

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.935
Bumblebee, stop lubricating the man.

01:23:35.036 --> 01:23:37.095
Get that thing to stop, huh?

01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:41.739
- All right, tough guy, take it off.
- What are you talking about?

01:23:41.843 --> 01:23:44.539
- Your clothes, all of it, off.
- For what?

01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:47.611
For threatening my Dad.

01:23:50.685 --> 01:23:56.590
Little lady, this is the beginning
of the end of your life.

01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:00.021
You're a criminal.

01:24:00.695 --> 01:24:03.493
Let's face facts. It's in your gene pool.

01:24:04.966 --> 01:24:07.799
Those are nice.
Now get behind the pole.

01:24:07.902 --> 01:24:08.891
All right.

01:24:09.003 --> 01:24:11.096
This is such a felony, what you're doing.

01:24:13.141 --> 01:24:15.041
- I will hunt you down, okay?
- He'll hunt you down.

01:24:15.176 --> 01:24:17.337
- Without any remorse!
- No remorse.

01:24:17.445 --> 01:24:18.707
- Enjoy.
- Okay?

01:24:18.813 --> 01:24:23.250
- We have got to alert everyone.
- They already know. Speaker.

01:24:29.791 --> 01:24:31.725
Optimus! Incoming!

01:24:39.434 --> 01:24:40.662
Roll out.

01:24:47.575 --> 01:24:50.908
<i>Okay, I'm picking up rad readings
under that bridge right down there.</i>

01:24:53.782 --> 01:24:57.183
<i>Okay, I'm getting really good rad
readings. Forty-two and higher.</i>

01:24:57.285 --> 01:24:58.616
Up you get.

01:25:03.324 --> 01:25:05.292
<i>Okay, we're dropping in.</i>

01:25:09.330 --> 01:25:11.924
<i>Really strong readings right down
below us. There he is.</i>

01:25:12.033 --> 01:25:14.194
<i>Ship one and two, come on in.</i>

01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:17.898
<i>That's it, right there.
Mark him, Mark him.</i>

01:25:18.006 --> 01:25:21.271
<i>Okay, there he is. 11:30. 11:30.
Right off the nose.</i>

01:25:21.810 --> 01:25:23.368
<i>I got it. 12:00.</i>

01:25:27.449 --> 01:25:28.929
<i>Okay, I'm tracking him. I've got him.</i>

01:25:31.853 --> 01:25:34.048
<i>Got him going down the street.</i>

01:25:37.659 --> 01:25:42.221
<i>Okay. Where'd he go, guys? I lost him.
Got no IR signature. Where'd he go?</i>

01:25:42.564 --> 01:25:44.725
<i>Okay, I lost him. I lost him.</i>

01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:47.291
<i>Okay, we're coming around.</i>

01:26:09.991 --> 01:26:11.515
Easy, you two.

01:26:20.902 --> 01:26:24.133
No! No! No, Sam! Sam, don't drop me!

01:26:24.806 --> 01:26:27.798
Sam, don't! Sam, don't! I'm slipping!
I'm slipping!

01:26:29.043 --> 01:26:31.102
- Hold on!
- No!

01:26:34.816 --> 01:26:36.044
Sam!

01:26:41.656 --> 01:26:44.784
<i>All right, we've got him pinned.
We've got him pinned in the river.</i>

01:26:44.893 --> 01:26:46.155
<i>I'm in for the shot.</i>

01:26:46.261 --> 01:26:47.694
Stop! Stop!

01:26:48.897 --> 01:26:50.694
Wait! No!

01:26:54.068 --> 01:26:56.662
<i>- Take the shot, get him.
- Take the shot.</i>

01:26:57.238 --> 01:26:58.432
No!

01:27:14.522 --> 01:27:16.615
No! Stop!

01:27:17.225 --> 01:27:18.522
Stop!

01:27:19.127 --> 01:27:22.563
<i>Get down on the ground! Get down!
Get down!</i>

01:27:23.565 --> 01:27:24.896
What? Okay.

01:27:26.768 --> 01:27:28.929
Look, he's not fighting back!

01:27:29.537 --> 01:27:31.732
Freeze it! Freeze it! Freeze it!

01:27:38.112 --> 01:27:39.670
Stop hurting him!

01:27:49.090 --> 01:27:50.785
Don't let him move!

01:27:51.526 --> 01:27:53.084
I got him here!

01:28:16.284 --> 01:28:17.342
No!

01:28:21.356 --> 01:28:23.153
Happy to see me again?

01:28:24.659 --> 01:28:27.389
Put him in a car
with his little criminal friend.

01:28:33.267 --> 01:28:36.327
I want that thing frozen
and ready for transport!

01:28:44.512 --> 01:28:46.776
Hang back. Let me check it out.

01:28:49.617 --> 01:28:51.016
Optimus,

01:28:53.354 --> 01:28:55.822
are we just gonna stand here
and do nothing?

01:28:55.923 --> 01:28:59.620
There's no way to free Bumblebee
without harming the humans.

01:28:59.727 --> 01:29:02.525
- But it's not right. He...
- Let them leave.

01:29:14.542 --> 01:29:16.908
The Chinese and the Russians
are nearing our area of operations

01:29:17.011 --> 01:29:18.137
in the Western Pacific.

01:29:18.246 --> 01:29:20.441
We feel like this could get
out of hand real fast.

01:29:20.548 --> 01:29:23.312
But the next couple of hours
may just define his presidency.

01:29:27.655 --> 01:29:30.522
US and Chinese task forces
approaching 100 nautical miles

01:29:30.625 --> 01:29:31.956
of cruise missile range.

01:29:32.060 --> 01:29:35.587
Tell the strike group commander that
he's not to engage unless fired on first.

01:29:35.697 --> 01:29:37.665
- Yes, sir!
- Mr. Secretary?

01:29:40.068 --> 01:29:45.131
Tom Banachek. I'm with Sector Seven,
Advanced Research Division.

01:29:45.239 --> 01:29:48.436
Never heard of it. I'm a little busy, Tom.
I think you can see that.

01:29:51.579 --> 01:29:54.070
- What's going on here?
- I don't know.

01:29:57.719 --> 01:30:00.381
Sit rep! Talk to me!

01:30:00.488 --> 01:30:02.888
- The whole room's gone down, sir.
- I can see that!

01:30:02.990 --> 01:30:04.651
The virus was coded to shut us down.

01:30:04.759 --> 01:30:07.193
- General?
- I'll take a seat.

01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:09.196
What do you mean, "shut us down"?

01:30:09.297 --> 01:30:12.289
They used our network to spread out
to the whole world.

01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:13.492
The blackout's global.

01:30:13.601 --> 01:30:16.434
We have no communications,
satellite and land lines are dead.

01:30:16.537 --> 01:30:21.065
You mean to tell me that I cannot pick
up this telephone and call my family?

01:30:27.014 --> 01:30:31.314
Mr. Secretary? I'm here under
direct order from the President.

01:30:33.321 --> 01:30:35.687
You really need to see
what I have in the case.

01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:40.318
You'll have to accept that
there are certain things

01:30:40.428 --> 01:30:42.521
you won't understand right away.

01:30:42.630 --> 01:30:45.963
Sector Seven is a special-access
division of the government

01:30:46.067 --> 01:30:49.468
convened in secret under
President Hoover 80 years ago.

01:30:50.338 --> 01:30:54.434
You may remember NASA JPL
lost the Beagle 2 Mars Rover.

01:30:55.543 --> 01:30:59.809
We told them to report the mission
a complete failure. It wasn't.

01:31:00.281 --> 01:31:02.681
Beagle 2 transmitted 13 seconds.

01:31:03.284 --> 01:31:05.809
This was classified above top secret.

01:31:20.802 --> 01:31:23.430
<i>EDA ended at 170 hours, 48 minutes.</i>

01:31:23.538 --> 01:31:26.166
More than just a pile of Martian rocks.

01:31:27.441 --> 01:31:29.534
This is the image from Mars.

01:31:30.378 --> 01:31:33.142
Here's the image your
Special Ops team was able to retrieve

01:31:33.247 --> 01:31:35.010
from the base attack.

01:31:35.783 --> 01:31:38.877
We believe they are of
the same exoskeletal type,

01:31:39.754 --> 01:31:42.518
and obviously not Russian
or North Korean.

01:31:42.924 --> 01:31:45.586
Are we talking about an invasion?

01:31:45.693 --> 01:31:48.787
We intercepted the message
from your Special Ops team.

01:31:48.896 --> 01:31:52.229
These things can be hurt by
our weapons and now they know it.

01:31:52.333 --> 01:31:54.062
That's why the virus shut us down,

01:31:54.168 --> 01:31:57.467
so we can't coordinate against
their next attack,

01:31:57.572 --> 01:32:02.066
which I would bet my ridiculous
government salary is coming soon.

01:32:05.947 --> 01:32:08.279
Get word to our fleet commanders
over the National Guard frequency.

01:32:08.382 --> 01:32:11.783
It's a shortwave radio channel.
It might be still working.

01:32:11.886 --> 01:32:15.219
Tell them to turn their ships around
and come home. ASAP!

01:32:15.323 --> 01:32:18.292
And inform all commands to prepare
for imminent attack.

01:32:28.502 --> 01:32:31.767
Captain Lennox, we need you and
your team to come with us right now!

01:32:31.873 --> 01:32:32.840
Let's go!

01:32:37.879 --> 01:32:39.369
She's in here.

01:32:39.747 --> 01:32:41.408
What's going on?

01:32:41.949 --> 01:32:43.780
You're coming with me.

01:32:44.218 --> 01:32:46.914
- You're going to be my advisor.
- Me, too?

01:32:47.922 --> 01:32:49.253
Who's this?

01:32:50.024 --> 01:32:53.118
- He's my advisor.
- He comes, too.

01:33:04.405 --> 01:33:06.896
- So...
- What'd they get you for?

01:33:07.975 --> 01:33:12.241
I bought a car.
Turned out to be an alien robot.

01:33:12.346 --> 01:33:13.313
Wow.

01:33:13.981 --> 01:33:15.107
Who knew?

01:33:31.899 --> 01:33:33.799
Make a hole! Watch your back!

01:33:44.612 --> 01:33:47.342
Please, let this work.

01:33:48.749 --> 01:33:50.649
Fire it up, Optimus.

01:33:51.619 --> 01:33:53.109
The code.

01:33:53.220 --> 01:33:58.624
The code on these glasses indicates
the All Spark is 230 miles from here.

01:34:00.428 --> 01:34:04.228
I sense the Decepticons
are getting ready to mobilize.

01:34:05.399 --> 01:34:07.162
They must know it's here, as well.

01:34:07.268 --> 01:34:08.599
What about Bumblebee?

01:34:08.703 --> 01:34:12.764
We can't just leave him to die
and become some human experiment!

01:34:12.873 --> 01:34:16.866
He'll die in vain
if we don't accomplish our mission.

01:34:16.978 --> 01:34:21.210
Bumblebee is a brave soldier.
This is what he would want.

01:34:21.315 --> 01:34:24.250
Why are we fighting to save
the humans?

01:34:25.653 --> 01:34:29.020
<i>They're a primitive and violent race.</i>

01:34:31.359 --> 01:34:33.350
Were we so different?

01:34:34.261 --> 01:34:38.630
<i>They're a young species.
They have much to learn.</i>

01:34:38.733 --> 01:34:41.531
<i>But I've seen goodness in them.</i>

01:34:41.635 --> 01:34:45.799
<i>Freedom is the right of
all sentient beings.</i>

01:34:45.906 --> 01:34:50.138
<i>You all know there's only one way
to end this war.</i>

01:34:50.244 --> 01:34:52.940
<i>We must destroy the Cube.</i>

01:34:53.748 --> 01:34:58.310
If all else fails, I will unite it
with the spark in my chest.

01:34:58.419 --> 01:34:59.750
That's suicide.

01:34:59.854 --> 01:35:03.654
The Cube is raw power.
It could destroy you both.

01:35:03.758 --> 01:35:08.218
A necessary sacrifice to bring peace
to this planet.

01:35:08.329 --> 01:35:11.628
We cannot let the humans pay
for our mistakes.

01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:15.796
It's been an honor serving with you all.

01:35:15.903 --> 01:35:19.703
- Autobots, roll out!
- We rolling!

01:35:31.752 --> 01:35:34.915
Team attention! Present arms!

01:35:35.589 --> 01:35:39.821
At ease. Captain, Sergeant.
Got your intel. Excellent work.

01:35:39.927 --> 01:35:41.622
Thank you, sir.
What about the gunships?

01:35:41.729 --> 01:35:43.856
They're being retrofitted
with sabot rounds now.

01:35:43.964 --> 01:35:45.226
If they hit us again,
we'll be ready for them.

01:35:45.332 --> 01:35:48.426
But it won't do us much good if we can't
get world communications back up.

01:35:49.937 --> 01:35:51.165
Hey, kid.

01:35:52.239 --> 01:35:54.901
I think we got off to a bad start, huh?

01:35:55.443 --> 01:35:56.535
You must be hungry?

01:35:56.644 --> 01:35:58.635
You want a latte? HoHo?
Double venti macchiato?

01:35:58.746 --> 01:36:00.373
Where's my car?

01:36:00.481 --> 01:36:04.042
Son, I need you to listen to me
very carefully.

01:36:04.552 --> 01:36:06.247
People can die here.

01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:09.316
We need to know everything you know.
We need to know it now.

01:36:09.423 --> 01:36:10.617
Okay.

01:36:10.724 --> 01:36:14.455
But first, I'll take my car, my parents.
Maybe you should write that down.

01:36:14.562 --> 01:36:19.261
Oh, and her juvie record.
That's got to be gone. Like, forever.

01:36:20.901 --> 01:36:23.870
Come with me.
We'll talk about your car.

01:36:23.971 --> 01:36:25.268
Thank you.

01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:28.469
The man's an extortionist.

01:36:30.211 --> 01:36:31.542
All right, here's the situation.

01:36:31.645 --> 01:36:34.045
You've all had direct contact
with the NBEs.

01:36:34.148 --> 01:36:35.240
NBEs?

01:36:35.349 --> 01:36:38.944
Non-Biological Extraterrestrials.
Try and keep up with the acronyms.

01:36:39.053 --> 01:36:42.682
What you're about to see
is totally classified.

01:36:51.866 --> 01:36:53.695
Dear God. What is this?

01:36:55.269 --> 01:36:58.534
We think when he made his approach
over the north pole,

01:36:58.639 --> 01:37:02.075
our gravitational field screwed up
his telemetry.

01:37:02.176 --> 01:37:06.169
He crashed in the ice,
probably a few thousand years ago.

01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:09.545
We shipped him here to this facility
in 1934.

01:37:09.650 --> 01:37:12.050
We call him NBE One.

01:37:12.153 --> 01:37:14.519
Well, sir, I don't mean to correct you
on everything you think you know,

01:37:14.622 --> 01:37:17.022
but, I mean, that's Megatron.

01:37:18.292 --> 01:37:20.123
He's the leader of the Decepticons.

01:37:20.227 --> 01:37:23.560
He's been in cryostasis since 1935.

01:37:23.664 --> 01:37:27.122
Your great-great-grandfather made
one of the greatest discoveries

01:37:27.234 --> 01:37:28.667
in the history of mankind.

01:37:28.769 --> 01:37:31.704
Fact is, you're looking at
the source of the modern age,

01:37:31.805 --> 01:37:38.643
the microchip, lasers, spaceflight, cars,
all reverse-engineered by studying him.

01:37:38.746 --> 01:37:42.546
NBE One. That's what we call it.

01:37:43.117 --> 01:37:45.745
And you didn't think the United States
military might need to know

01:37:45.853 --> 01:37:48.219
that you're keeping a hostile alien robot
frozen in the basement?

01:37:48.322 --> 01:37:52.315
Until these events, we had no
credible threat to national security.

01:37:52.426 --> 01:37:54.291
Well, you got one now.

01:37:55.229 --> 01:37:57.629
- So why Earth?
- It's the All Spark.

01:37:57.731 --> 01:37:59.255
All Spark? What is that?

01:37:59.366 --> 01:38:01.926
Well, yeah, they came here looking
for some sort of cube-looking thing.

01:38:02.036 --> 01:38:06.803
Anyway, Mr. NBE One here, AKA
Megatron, that's what they call him,

01:38:06.907 --> 01:38:09.387
who's pretty much the harbinger
of death, wants to use the Cube

01:38:09.443 --> 01:38:12.537
to transform human technology
to take over the universe.

01:38:12.646 --> 01:38:14.170
That's their plan.

01:38:14.281 --> 01:38:16.681
- And you're sure about that?
- Yeah.

01:38:19.019 --> 01:38:21.283
You guys know where it is, don't you?

01:38:22.723 --> 01:38:23.849
Follow me.

01:38:27.494 --> 01:38:29.985
You're about to see our crown jewel.

01:38:38.939 --> 01:38:42.500
Carbon dating puts the Cube here
around 10,000 BC.

01:38:43.410 --> 01:38:47.039
The first Seven didn't find it until 1913.

01:38:47.881 --> 01:38:51.749
They knew it was alien because of
the matching hieroglyphics on the Cube

01:38:51.852 --> 01:38:53.376
as well as NBE One.

01:38:53.487 --> 01:38:56.047
President Hoover had the dam built
around it.

01:38:56.156 --> 01:38:58.522
Four football fields thick of concrete.

01:38:58.626 --> 01:39:01.959
A perfect way to hide its energy
from being detected by anyone

01:39:02.062 --> 01:39:05.657
or any alien species on the outside.

01:39:44.471 --> 01:39:48.271
Wait, back up. You said
the dam hides the Cube's energy.

01:39:48.909 --> 01:39:51.400
- What kind exactly?
- Good question.

01:39:55.983 --> 01:39:58.850
Please step inside.
They have to lock us in.

01:40:04.758 --> 01:40:06.419
Oh, wow.

01:40:06.527 --> 01:40:08.552
What's that? Freddy Krueger done
been up in here or something?

01:40:08.662 --> 01:40:09.856
Oh, no, man.

01:40:09.997 --> 01:40:14.457
Freddy Krueger have four blades, man.
That's only three. That's Wolverine!

01:40:14.568 --> 01:40:17.503
- Right? That's Wolverine!
- That's very funny.

01:40:19.039 --> 01:40:22.065
Anybody have any mechanical devices?
BlackBerry? Key alarm? Cell phone?

01:40:22.176 --> 01:40:23.609
I got a phone.

01:40:26.814 --> 01:40:29.408
Nokias are real nasty.

01:40:29.516 --> 01:40:33.953
You've got to respect the Japanese.
They know the way of the samurai.

01:40:34.755 --> 01:40:36.882
Nokia's from Finland.

01:40:36.990 --> 01:40:41.552
Yes, but he's, you know, a little strange.
He's a little strange.

01:40:44.331 --> 01:40:49.894
We're able to take the Cube radiation
and funnel it into that box.

01:41:03.584 --> 01:41:06.883
- Mean little sucker, huh?
- That thing is freaky!

01:41:06.987 --> 01:41:10.650
Kind of like the itty-bitty
Energizer Bunny from hell, huh?

01:41:21.668 --> 01:41:23.533
He's breaking the box.

01:41:41.522 --> 01:41:42.648
Go! Go! Go!

01:41:42.756 --> 01:41:43.848
Move!

01:41:52.399 --> 01:41:55.027
Gentlemen, they know the Cube is here.

01:41:55.803 --> 01:41:57.134
Banachek. What's going on?

01:41:57.237 --> 01:41:59.068
Well, the NBE One hangar
has lost power...

01:41:59.173 --> 01:42:00.231
<i>- What?
- ...and the backup generator</i>

01:42:00.340 --> 01:42:02.501
<i>- is just not gonna cut it.
- Do you have an arms room?</i>

01:42:08.715 --> 01:42:10.478
Megatron! Megatron! Megatron!

01:42:10.584 --> 01:42:11.983
I'll bring security to the...

01:42:12.085 --> 01:42:14.610
Get everyone to
the NBE One chamber now!

01:42:14.721 --> 01:42:16.322
- The lights are out!
- Move it! Move it!

01:42:16.423 --> 01:42:17.788
Let's go!

01:42:17.891 --> 01:42:19.654
They're popping our generators!

01:42:31.672 --> 01:42:33.037
Megatron melting!

01:42:33.674 --> 01:42:36.734
<i>16502. We're losing pressure.</i>

01:42:36.844 --> 01:42:39.039
Stand by! Set!

01:42:39.146 --> 01:42:41.205
<i>We're losing pressure!</i>

01:42:41.315 --> 01:42:44.751
<i>The cryogenic system is failing!
We're losing NBE One!</i>

01:42:49.490 --> 01:42:52.186
Forty millimeter sabot rounds
on that table!

01:42:52.292 --> 01:42:56.285
That's good. Get all the ammo you got.
Everything you can carry. Bring it.

01:43:01.835 --> 01:43:04.463
You got to take me to my car.
You have to take me to my car.

01:43:04.571 --> 01:43:05.595
He's gonna know what to do
with the Cube.

01:43:05.706 --> 01:43:07.640
- Your car? It's confiscated.
- Then unconfiscate it.

01:43:07.741 --> 01:43:09.470
We do not know what will happen
if we let it near this thing!

01:43:09.576 --> 01:43:10.838
- You don't know.
- Maybe you know, but I don't know.

01:43:10.944 --> 01:43:12.309
You just wanna sit here and wait
and see what happens?

01:43:12.412 --> 01:43:14.403
I have people's lives at stake here,
young man.

01:43:14.515 --> 01:43:16.244
Take him to his car!

01:43:17.985 --> 01:43:19.179
Drop it.

01:43:20.954 --> 01:43:22.615
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:43:23.891 --> 01:43:25.882
Drop your weapon, soldier.

01:43:26.393 --> 01:43:28.122
There's an alien war going on
and you're gonna shoot me?

01:43:28.228 --> 01:43:29.252
You know, we didn't ask to be here.

01:43:29.363 --> 01:43:31.558
I'm ordering you under S-Seven
executive jurisdiction.

01:43:31.665 --> 01:43:32.825
Seven don't exist.

01:43:32.933 --> 01:43:34.696
Right. And we don't take orders
from people that don't exist.

01:43:34.801 --> 01:43:38.066
- I'm gonna count to five. Okay.
- Well, I'm gonna count to three.

01:43:40.674 --> 01:43:42.301
- Simmons?
- Yes, sir?

01:43:42.409 --> 01:43:46.470
I'd do what he says. Losing's really
not an option for these guys.

01:43:50.984 --> 01:43:52.952
All right. Okay.

01:43:53.053 --> 01:43:57.683
Hey, you want to lay the fate of the
world on the kid's Camaro? That's cool.

01:44:01.128 --> 01:44:02.390
No, no!

01:44:03.363 --> 01:44:06.025
Stop! You got to stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:44:06.133 --> 01:44:09.694
No, no, stop, stop, stop!
Let him go! Let him go!

01:44:10.904 --> 01:44:12.303
Are you okay?

01:44:14.174 --> 01:44:16.267
They didn't hurt you, right?

01:44:25.018 --> 01:44:28.818
Listen to me. The Cube is here
and the Decepticons are coming.

01:44:31.224 --> 01:44:33.317
No, no, don't worry about them.
They're okay. Right?

01:44:33.427 --> 01:44:35.657
They're not gonna hurt you.

01:44:35.762 --> 01:44:39.289
Just back up a little bit.
He's friendly. He's fine.

01:44:39.399 --> 01:44:42.664
Okay, come on. Put the guns down.
They're not gonna hurt you.

01:44:42.769 --> 01:44:44.970
Here, come with me.
I'm gonna take you to the All Spark.

01:45:06.326 --> 01:45:09.818
Okay, here we go. He doing something.
He doing something.

01:45:29.950 --> 01:45:31.281
Oh, my God.

01:45:36.089 --> 01:45:37.488
<i>Message from Starfleet, Captain.</i>

01:45:37.591 --> 01:45:38.990
<i>Let's get to it.</i>

01:45:39.092 --> 01:45:42.118
He's right. We stay here, we're screwed
with Megatron in the other hangar.

01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:43.628
Mission City is 22 miles away.

01:45:43.730 --> 01:45:45.027
We're gonna sneak that Cube
out of here

01:45:45.132 --> 01:45:46.531
and we're gonna hide it somewhere
in the city.

01:45:46.633 --> 01:45:47.600
Good! Right.

01:45:47.701 --> 01:45:50.431
But we cannot make a stand
without the Air Force.

01:45:50.537 --> 01:45:52.596
This place must have some kind
of radio link!

01:45:52.706 --> 01:45:54.571
- Yes. Shortwave, CB.
- Right, yes.

01:45:54.675 --> 01:45:57.269
Sir, you got to figure out some way
to get word out to them. Let's move!

01:45:57.377 --> 01:45:58.810
In the alien archive, sir!

01:45:58.912 --> 01:46:00.912
- The alien...
- There's an old Army radio console.

01:46:01.014 --> 01:46:02.538
- Will it work?
- Anything's possible!

01:46:02.649 --> 01:46:05.083
- Did you see that...
- All right, Sam, get it in the car!

01:46:05.185 --> 01:46:06.948
Mr. Secretary! Get our birds in the air.

01:46:07.054 --> 01:46:08.681
When we get to the city,
we're gonna find a radio,

01:46:08.789 --> 01:46:10.757
and I'll have Epps vector them in, okay?

01:46:10.857 --> 01:46:12.381
Affirmative!

01:46:12.492 --> 01:46:16.326
<i>Warning! NBE One
cryo-containment failing.</i>

01:46:17.330 --> 01:46:19.195
Check that backup system!

01:46:19.299 --> 01:46:23.463
The cryo's failing! You got to bump up
the cryo! The cryo's failing!

01:46:23.570 --> 01:46:25.060
Come on! Get out of here!

01:46:25.172 --> 01:46:26.696
Heads up! Look out!

01:46:27.708 --> 01:46:30.108
Set a perimeter around
the yellow vehicle!

01:46:30.210 --> 01:46:33.646
- This way, this way, this way!
- Up there! Let's go!

01:46:43.356 --> 01:46:46.416
I am Megatron!

01:47:05.245 --> 01:47:06.685
- The Cube's okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.

01:47:06.747 --> 01:47:07.847
Well, put the seat belt on.

01:47:07.848 --> 01:47:09.008
Pour it on him!

01:47:22.763 --> 01:47:24.754
I live to serve you, Lord Megatron.

01:47:24.865 --> 01:47:27.265
Where is the Cube?

01:47:27.367 --> 01:47:29.426
The humans have taken it.

01:47:32.806 --> 01:47:36.674
You fail me yet again, Starscream.
Get them!

01:47:37.110 --> 01:47:38.577
Come on, Mags!

01:47:39.679 --> 01:47:41.169
Over here, sir!

01:47:43.517 --> 01:47:45.576
Give me a minute. Give me a minute.

01:47:45.685 --> 01:47:48.119
Come to me, Maxwell, come to me.
Plugged in there.

01:47:50.023 --> 01:47:53.481
- We're hot! We're live!
- Where are the Mikes?

01:47:54.528 --> 01:47:55.517
Mikes?

01:47:55.629 --> 01:47:56.891
This doesn't work without Mikes,
Simmons.

01:47:56.997 --> 01:47:58.555
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:47:58.665 --> 01:48:00.189
Let's find them.

01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:01.767
Kid, get in the chair!
Just get in the chair, all right?

01:48:01.868 --> 01:48:04.029
- Okay, I'll sit. I'll sit.
- They steal everything out of this place.

01:48:04.137 --> 01:48:07.197
How do we get the signal out?
How do we call the Air Force?

01:48:07.307 --> 01:48:08.604
- Glen?
- Huh?

01:48:08.708 --> 01:48:12.200
Can you hotwire this computer to
transmit a tone through the radio?

01:48:12.312 --> 01:48:13.301
What good is that?

01:48:13.413 --> 01:48:15.813
Morse code! You can use this
to transmit it through that!

01:48:15.916 --> 01:48:19.477
Okay, I'll do it! Turn it around.
Okay, let's see.

01:48:19.586 --> 01:48:21.417
Simmons, I need a screwdriver!

01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:34.724
There's Optimus.

01:48:52.686 --> 01:48:54.153
Almost done.

01:48:55.989 --> 01:48:57.889
What the hell was that?

01:49:00.961 --> 01:49:02.656
Barricade the door!

01:49:05.398 --> 01:49:07.764
- Get something.
- Watch out!

01:49:07.868 --> 01:49:09.961
Six, five, four, six, three.

01:49:14.641 --> 01:49:17.007
Here! Put some rounds in!

01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:21.313
Master search.

01:49:22.215 --> 01:49:24.206
I got it! We're transmitting!

01:49:24.317 --> 01:49:25.443
Send exactly what I say!

01:49:25.552 --> 01:49:29.682
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Burn, you little sucker! Burn!

01:49:29.789 --> 01:49:33.816
"This is Defense Secretary Keller.
Get me NORTHCOM commander."

01:49:33.927 --> 01:49:35.451
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

01:49:37.163 --> 01:49:38.187
What was that?

01:49:38.298 --> 01:49:41.131
Authenticate emergency action.
Blackbird 1195...

01:49:43.303 --> 01:49:45.623
Sir, I have an authenticated
air strike order from Sec Def.

01:50:10.230 --> 01:50:12.198
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What?

01:50:12.299 --> 01:50:15.735
It's the same cop!
Block them, block them, block them.

01:50:36.957 --> 01:50:37.946
Oh, my God.

01:51:06.519 --> 01:51:07.850
Cool, Mom!

01:51:33.747 --> 01:51:35.738
This is so not good.

01:51:54.234 --> 01:51:56.099
He's behind the pillar!

01:52:01.975 --> 01:52:05.069
- Shoot that mother...
- Maggie, cover fire!

01:52:08.214 --> 01:52:10.546
It's the Air Force! They're responding!

01:52:14.421 --> 01:52:16.389
Sucker, burn!

01:52:22.162 --> 01:52:23.493
Oh, shit!

01:52:23.830 --> 01:52:25.855
Yes! They're sending F-22s to the city!

01:52:27.067 --> 01:52:29.092
<i>Raptors, let's scramble,
scramble, scramble.</i>

01:52:30.303 --> 01:52:32.567
<i>Strike and Dark Star roll call.</i>

01:52:34.908 --> 01:52:36.375
<i>Looking out the right side.</i>

01:52:37.277 --> 01:52:39.438
<i>Push to Kill Box One Alpha...</i>

01:52:47.020 --> 01:52:50.581
- Come on, let's go! Mount up!
- Move out! Move out! Go! Go!

01:52:50.690 --> 01:52:52.885
Here, I got shortwave radios.

01:52:53.426 --> 01:52:55.621
Wait. What am I supposed to
do with these?

01:52:55.728 --> 01:52:58.026
Well, use them! It's all we got!

01:52:58.431 --> 01:53:01.423
This is like RadioShack dinosaur radios
or something, man.

01:53:01.534 --> 01:53:04.469
I'm only gonna get 20 or 30 miles
out of these things.

01:53:04.571 --> 01:53:07.267
Are there any aircraft orbiting the city?

01:53:07.874 --> 01:53:09.466
F-22 at 12:00.

01:53:09.576 --> 01:53:12.297
All right, I want planes for air cover
and get Black Hawks on station

01:53:12.378 --> 01:53:14.243
to extract that Cube. You got it?

01:53:16.749 --> 01:53:19.149
Air Force has arrived! Pop smoke!

01:53:19.452 --> 01:53:21.079
Raptor, Raptor, do you copy?

01:53:22.355 --> 01:53:23.515
<i>We have you visual.</i>

01:53:25.191 --> 01:53:26.522
<i>Green smoke is the Mark.</i>

01:53:26.626 --> 01:53:30.084
<i>Provide air cover and vector
Black Hawks for extraction.</i>

01:53:34.734 --> 01:53:36.702
It's Starscream!

01:53:37.170 --> 01:53:38.831
Please tell me you copy.

01:53:39.172 --> 01:53:41.470
Back up! Take cover! Bumblebee!

01:53:45.278 --> 01:53:47.246
No, no, no, no, no! Move!

01:53:47.347 --> 01:53:50.510
- Back up! Back up!
- Retreat! Fall back!

01:53:50.617 --> 01:53:51.845
Incoming!

01:54:16.943 --> 01:54:18.740
Anybody hurt? Everyone okay?

01:54:18.845 --> 01:54:20.312
Clear the area!

01:54:26.119 --> 01:54:27.643
Oh, my God.

01:54:28.521 --> 01:54:31.388
Bumblebee? No. Your legs!

01:54:31.824 --> 01:54:33.155
Your legs.

01:54:34.727 --> 01:54:38.356
Here. Here, back, back, back, back!
You all right?

01:54:39.899 --> 01:54:42.333
Please get up. Bumblebee? Get up!

01:54:43.903 --> 01:54:45.097
Ratchet!

01:54:46.973 --> 01:54:48.440
- What the hell was that?
- What are you talking about?

01:54:48.541 --> 01:54:50.475
What do you mean, what am
I talking about? They shot at us!

01:54:50.577 --> 01:54:52.943
F-22 pilots would never fly
below buildings.

01:54:53.046 --> 01:54:55.207
That's alien. That ain't friendly!

01:54:55.315 --> 01:54:58.113
You got to get up. You're okay.
You're okay.

01:54:59.385 --> 01:55:00.409
Come on!

01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:02.647
<i>Army Black Hawk inbound
to your location. Over.</i>

01:55:04.424 --> 01:55:06.551
Alpha 273 degrees, 10 miles.

01:55:06.659 --> 01:55:08.991
November Victor, 1.2 clicks north.

01:55:27.213 --> 01:55:28.646
Move out! Let's go!

01:55:35.088 --> 01:55:36.783
Let's go! Move!

01:55:43.396 --> 01:55:45.057
I'm not gonna leave you.

01:56:24.170 --> 01:56:26.195
Come on, Decepticon punk!

01:56:32.512 --> 01:56:34.036
Oh, my God!

01:56:46.592 --> 01:56:48.526
Concentrate your fire!

01:56:59.439 --> 01:57:00.633
Come on. Come on.

01:57:03.209 --> 01:57:04.904
Megatron!

01:57:09.615 --> 01:57:13.278
It's Megatron! Retreat! Move! Fall back!

01:57:17.557 --> 01:57:19.149
Fall back!

01:57:25.164 --> 01:57:27.359
Get our guys out of the way!
Get out of here! Go!

01:57:27.467 --> 01:57:29.492
Get them out of the buggy! Move out!

01:57:29.602 --> 01:57:31.866
We need air cover down here now!

01:57:37.877 --> 01:57:39.276
Sam, help me with this.

01:57:43.449 --> 01:57:47.783
- That all you got, Megatron?
- Come here, little cretin.

01:57:47.887 --> 01:57:49.980
You want a piece of me?
You want a piece?

01:57:50.089 --> 01:57:52.387
No! I want two!

01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:55.359
What's going on?

01:57:57.163 --> 01:57:59.791
Sir! That tank thing's getting back up.

01:58:00.666 --> 01:58:02.930
Oh, these things just don't die.

01:58:06.506 --> 01:58:07.996
Oh, we're so dead.

01:58:08.107 --> 01:58:10.439
- Wrap it around the head.
- Sam!

01:58:10.743 --> 01:58:11.732
Where's the Cube?

01:58:11.844 --> 01:58:12.811
- Right there.
- Okay.

01:58:12.912 --> 01:58:13.901
And take that and wrap it around

01:58:14.013 --> 01:58:14.980
the base and then put it
around his neck.

01:58:15.081 --> 01:58:17.743
- Okay?
- Epps, get those Black Hawks here!

01:58:19.185 --> 01:58:20.652
That building.

01:58:24.424 --> 01:58:26.221
- Okay.
- What?

01:58:26.325 --> 01:58:29.294
All right, I can't leave my guys back
there, so here, take this flare.

01:58:29.395 --> 01:58:31.659
Okay, there's a tall, white building
with statues on top.

01:58:31.764 --> 01:58:33.959
- Go to the roof. Set the flare.
- No.

01:58:34.066 --> 01:58:36.000
- Signal the chopper and set the flare.
- No, no. I can't do this!

01:58:36.102 --> 01:58:40.505
Listen to me! You're a soldier now!
All right? I need you to take this Cube.

01:58:40.606 --> 01:58:42.836
Get it into military hands
while we hold them off,

01:58:42.942 --> 01:58:45.001
or a lot of people are gonna die.

01:58:45.144 --> 01:58:46.634
- You got to go. You got to go.
- No, I'm not leaving.

01:58:46.746 --> 01:58:47.906
- You need to go. Go.
- No, I'm not leaving

01:58:48.014 --> 01:58:50.710
till I get Bumblebee out of here, okay?

01:58:52.185 --> 01:58:53.243
Army Black Hawk requested.

01:58:53.352 --> 01:58:55.877
Immediate evac for civilian boy
with precious cargo.

01:58:55.988 --> 01:58:58.513
<i>Headed to rooftop marked by flare.</i>

01:58:58.624 --> 01:59:01.718
- Sam, we will protect you.
- Okay.

01:59:03.329 --> 01:59:06.662
- Epps, where are those planes?
- Sam!

01:59:10.636 --> 01:59:14.766
No matter what happens,
I'm really glad I got in that car with you.

01:59:18.010 --> 01:59:20.638
Sam! Get to the building! Move!

01:59:20.746 --> 01:59:23.977
- Decepticons, attack!
- Hit it!

01:59:26.719 --> 01:59:28.812
- Cover fire!
- Move to cover!

01:59:35.261 --> 01:59:36.558
Watch out!

01:59:42.168 --> 01:59:45.194
- Girl, get that tow truck out of here!
- I'm going! I'm going!

01:59:45.304 --> 01:59:46.965
Get out of here now!

02:00:14.834 --> 02:00:15.801
Megatron!

02:00:16.102 --> 02:00:17.069
Prime.

02:00:43.029 --> 02:00:45.088
Humans don't deserve to live.

02:00:45.197 --> 02:00:47.859
They deserve to choose for themselves.

02:00:48.301 --> 02:00:50.667
Then you will die with them!

02:00:56.342 --> 02:00:58.742
Join them in extinction!

02:01:17.964 --> 02:01:19.625
Keep moving, Sam!

02:01:20.633 --> 02:01:21.998
Don't stop!

02:01:38.017 --> 02:01:39.006
No!

02:01:54.233 --> 02:01:56.326
Sam, get to the building!

02:02:04.243 --> 02:02:06.370
Give me that Cube, boy!

02:02:19.025 --> 02:02:21.118
Did that jerk just dent my car?

02:02:42.481 --> 02:02:45.939
You're not gonna get me.
You're not gonna get me!

02:02:51.257 --> 02:02:54.385
I smell you, boy!

02:03:06.605 --> 02:03:07.765
Maggot!

02:03:26.792 --> 02:03:28.384
Oh, no!

02:03:52.952 --> 02:03:54.783
I'll drive! You shoot!

02:04:15.741 --> 02:04:17.038
This isn't going well!

02:04:17.143 --> 02:04:18.542
Shoot! Shoot!

02:05:04.390 --> 02:05:05.618
Nice shot.

02:05:05.724 --> 02:05:09.182
- That tank is definitely dead now.
- All right, let's go! We got business!

02:05:19.672 --> 02:05:20.730
Hey!

02:05:24.210 --> 02:05:27.646
Hey! I'm over here!

02:05:39.992 --> 02:05:41.687
We've got the boy.

02:05:46.298 --> 02:05:47.731
Watch out!

02:05:48.100 --> 02:05:49.294
Missile!

02:05:59.778 --> 02:06:01.211
Hang on, Sam!

02:06:09.955 --> 02:06:11.286
No! No!

02:06:16.996 --> 02:06:22.024
Is it fear or courage
that compels you, fleshling?

02:06:35.581 --> 02:06:37.048
Where do I go?

02:06:38.384 --> 02:06:42.343
Give me the All Spark
and you may live to be my pet.

02:06:43.656 --> 02:06:45.283
Oh, no, no, no, no.

02:06:49.461 --> 02:06:51.895
I'm never giving you this All Spark!

02:06:52.031 --> 02:06:54.829
Oh, so unwise.

02:07:06.779 --> 02:07:08.269
I got you, boy.

02:07:10.082 --> 02:07:11.879
Hold on to the Cube!

02:07:31.570 --> 02:07:34.437
- Oh, no. Oh, no!
- Disgusting.

02:07:39.445 --> 02:07:40.469
Sam?

02:07:44.750 --> 02:07:47.981
You risked your life to protect the Cube.

02:07:48.721 --> 02:07:50.188
No sacrifice,

02:07:51.557 --> 02:07:54.617
- no victory.
- If I cannot defeat Megatron,

02:07:54.960 --> 02:07:57.451
you must push the Cube into my chest.

02:07:57.863 --> 02:08:01.060
I will sacrifice myself to destroy it.

02:08:01.533 --> 02:08:03.000
Get behind me.

02:08:04.703 --> 02:08:07.263
It's you and me, Megatron.

02:08:07.373 --> 02:08:10.308
No, it's just me, Prime.

02:08:12.745 --> 02:08:17.876
At the end of this day,
one shall stand, one shall fall.

02:08:23.288 --> 02:08:28.123
You still fight for the weak!
That is why you lose!

02:08:47.279 --> 02:08:49.679
Fighter jets in 60 seconds.

02:08:49.782 --> 02:08:52.250
We got friendlies mixed with bad guys.
Targets will be marked.

02:08:52.351 --> 02:08:53.375
Hey.

02:08:54.586 --> 02:08:56.747
Bring the rain. All right?

02:08:57.156 --> 02:08:59.147
All right, let's kill these things.

02:09:01.126 --> 02:09:02.687
- Move, move, move!
- Remember, aim low.

02:09:02.795 --> 02:09:04.786
Armor's weak under the chest.

02:09:14.873 --> 02:09:16.431
Target marked. Still waiting.

02:09:16.542 --> 02:09:18.567
<i>Time on target, 20 seconds.</i>

02:09:25.517 --> 02:09:27.610
F-22s, we're still waiting.

02:09:32.858 --> 02:09:34.291
Move out!

02:09:37.529 --> 02:09:38.757
Incoming!

02:09:47.306 --> 02:09:49.399
<i>Weapons armed. Status green.</i>

02:10:08.060 --> 02:10:09.891
Run! Move!

02:10:17.402 --> 02:10:18.926
<i>Second wave's on approach.</i>

02:10:22.441 --> 02:10:24.033
<i>What is that? Break off!</i>

02:10:24.143 --> 02:10:26.611
<i>- Copy.
- It's either a massive amount of...</i>

02:10:35.354 --> 02:10:37.515
<i>Two, get a lock! Pop that guy!</i>

02:10:41.593 --> 02:10:43.686
<i>Stay on him. Keep him in your sights.</i>

02:10:44.062 --> 02:10:45.359
Take him out!

02:10:59.578 --> 02:11:00.909
Two's down!

02:11:10.355 --> 02:11:12.289
I'll kill you!

02:11:12.391 --> 02:11:15.155
Mine! All Spark!

02:11:16.128 --> 02:11:18.995
Sam! Put the Cube in my chest! Now!

02:11:19.698 --> 02:11:20.722
Sam!

02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:22.794
No, Sam!

02:11:48.627 --> 02:11:49.787
Hold up.

02:11:52.898 --> 02:11:55.867
You left me no choice, brother.

02:12:05.477 --> 02:12:08.344
Sam, I owe you my life.

02:12:09.481 --> 02:12:11.210
We are in your debt.

02:12:30.736 --> 02:12:33.136
Prime, we couldn't save him.

02:12:34.006 --> 02:12:35.303
Jazz.

02:12:38.510 --> 02:12:40.705
We lost a great comrade

02:12:42.047 --> 02:12:43.912
but gained new ones.

02:12:44.182 --> 02:12:46.480
Thank you, all of you.

02:12:46.818 --> 02:12:49.184
You honor us with your bravery.

02:12:50.222 --> 02:12:52.190
Permission to speak, sir?

02:12:52.691 --> 02:12:55.558
Permission granted, old friend.

02:12:55.661 --> 02:12:57.128
You speak now?

02:12:58.063 --> 02:13:00.156
I wish to stay with the boy.

02:13:01.033 --> 02:13:02.864
If that is his choice.

02:13:07.806 --> 02:13:08.830
Yes.

02:13:29.494 --> 02:13:34.227
Gentlemen, the President has ordered
Sector Seven be terminated

02:13:34.766 --> 02:13:37.792
and the remains of the dead aliens
disposed of.

02:13:38.437 --> 02:13:41.736
<i>The Laurentian Abyss is
seven miles below sea level,</i>

02:13:41.840 --> 02:13:43.933
<i>deepest place on our planet.</i>

02:13:44.176 --> 02:13:47.703
<i>The massive depth and pressure there,
coupled with subfreezing temperatures,</i>

02:13:47.813 --> 02:13:50.008
<i>would crush and entomb them,</i>

02:13:51.817 --> 02:13:53.546
<i>leaving no evidence.</i>

02:14:00.192 --> 02:14:04.595
<i>With the All Spark gone,
we cannot return life to our planet.</i>

02:14:06.331 --> 02:14:08.925
<i>And fate has yielded its reward,</i>

02:14:10.469 --> 02:14:13.370
<i>a new world to call home.</i>

02:14:19.644 --> 02:14:23.842
<i>We live among its people now,
hiding in plain sight,</i>

02:14:23.982 --> 02:14:26.746
<i>but watching over them in secret,</i>

02:14:26.985 --> 02:14:29.545
<i>waiting, protecting.</i>

02:14:30.956 --> 02:14:33.982
<i>I have witnessed
their capacity for courage.</i>

02:14:34.593 --> 02:14:37.585
<i>And though we are worlds apart,</i>

02:14:37.696 --> 02:14:42.633
<i>like us, there's more to them
than meets the eye.</i>

02:14:44.169 --> 02:14:46.660
<i>I am Optimus Prime</i>

02:14:47.072 --> 02:14:50.439
<i>and I send this message
to any surviving Autobots</i>

02:14:50.542 --> 02:14:53.534
<i>taking refuge among the stars.</i>

02:14:54.579 --> 02:14:56.308
<i>We are here.</i>

02:14:56.882 --> 02:14:58.907
<i>We are waiting.</i>

02:15:18.203 --> 02:15:23.231
Can you shed any light on the recent,
so-called alien activity in the area?

02:15:26.244 --> 02:15:31.739
Do you know what? I think that
if there was some sort of an alien

02:15:32.350 --> 02:15:34.250
- infestation...
- Yeah.

02:15:34.619 --> 02:15:37.053
They, the government,
would be the first to let you know.

02:15:37.155 --> 02:15:38.816
The government would let us know.

02:15:38.990 --> 02:15:40.582
- I mean, this is America.
- Yeah.

02:15:40.692 --> 02:15:43.126
You know, that's how we know
we live in a free land,

02:15:43.228 --> 02:15:44.855
because there's no secrets.

02:15:44.963 --> 02:15:47.056
They'd say, "Hey! Duck and cover."

02:15:57.108 --> 02:16:00.407
Your head is kind of a different size
than it is on television.
