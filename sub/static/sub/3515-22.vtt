00:01.000 --> 00:02.365
NICK: Previously on Grimm...

00:02.480 --> 00:05.245
MONROE: Mom, Dad, this
is my fiancÃ©e, Rosalee.

00:05.320 --> 00:06.401
(GROANS)

00:07.200 --> 00:08.361
A Fuchsbau?

00:08.440 --> 00:10.044
BART: Are you
out of your mind?

00:10.120 --> 00:11.451
ROSALEE: You think my
grandma's dress fits?

00:11.520 --> 00:12.646
Absolutely.

00:12.720 --> 00:13.846
I can't be your best man.

00:13.920 --> 00:15.001
It's just too dangerous.

00:15.080 --> 00:17.526
Now, what if one of them
Woged, saw that I'm a Grimm?

00:17.600 --> 00:18.681
You wear sunglasses.

00:18.760 --> 00:20.569
There you go!
Problem solved.

00:20.640 --> 00:21.801
RENARD: Why don't you
tell me how the Royals

00:21.880 --> 00:23.120
got a federal agent
to work for them.

00:23.200 --> 00:25.000
You're a dead man. And
you don't even know it.

00:25.040 --> 00:26.041
(GRUNTS)

00:26.120 --> 00:27.645
You wouldn't mind if I took
care of Renard, would you?

00:27.720 --> 00:28.721
I don't mind at all.

00:28.840 --> 00:30.683
ADALIND: Where is she?
Where's my daughter?

00:30.800 --> 00:31.801
I had no choice.

00:31.880 --> 00:33.245
ADALIND: I can't live
without my baby.

00:33.320 --> 00:35.448
There is one thing I'd
like you to do first.

00:35.520 --> 00:36.521
Anything.

00:36.640 --> 00:39.883
You remember how the Grimm
took your powers away?

00:39.960 --> 00:40.960
Yes.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.968
It's time to return the favor.

00:53.320 --> 00:56.290
By the power vested in me
by the great state of Oregon,

00:56.360 --> 00:59.728
I now pronounce
you man and wife.

00:59.800 --> 01:01.165
Et cetera, et cetera.

01:01.240 --> 01:03.720
Or, if you prefer,
husband and wife.

01:03.800 --> 01:06.121
Then we go for the
kiss, or I should say,

01:06.200 --> 01:07.565
the two of you
go in for the kiss.

01:07.640 --> 01:08.721
(GIGGLES)

01:08.800 --> 01:10.211
After which I present
you to the guests,

01:10.280 --> 01:12.760
and then you'll
be happily married.

01:16.120 --> 01:19.329
Do you plan on wearing sunglasses
during the ceremony tomorrow?

01:20.360 --> 01:21.486
Oh.

01:22.360 --> 01:25.125
You know, I have this
thing with my eyes.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.770
Yeah, no, he's got to wear them,

01:26.840 --> 01:30.208
'cause it's, like, a
light sensitivity issue

01:30.280 --> 01:31.770
that, if unprotected,
it could...

01:31.840 --> 01:33.649
Cause a sort of
retinitis situation.

01:33.720 --> 01:35.688
He has very thin corneas.
Could be really dangerous.

01:35.760 --> 01:37.364
He could go blind.
They're like tissue paper.

01:37.440 --> 01:39.568
The doctor really wants him
to keep them on, you know.

01:39.640 --> 01:40.926
Right, if he takes
off the glasses...

01:41.000 --> 01:42.001
He could go blind and...

01:42.120 --> 01:43.121
it could cause permanent damage.

01:43.200 --> 01:46.283
Okay, fine. He keeps the glasses.
Whatever you want.

01:46.360 --> 01:48.601
So unless anyone
wants to run it again?

01:48.680 --> 01:49.681
No, I think we're good.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.044
Then I'll see you tomorrow.
Enjoy your dinner.

01:52.120 --> 01:53.360
Thanks.

01:54.600 --> 01:56.280
(WHISPERS) Don't worry.
It's gonna be fine.

01:57.320 --> 02:01.450
Sir, want to hear the latest on Ms.
Schade?

02:01.520 --> 02:03.124
You find her?
No, not yet.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.804
Last report from
the cab company,

02:04.880 --> 02:06.086
she got dropped
off at the corner

02:06.160 --> 02:08.083
of Northeast 21 st and Chadwick,

02:08.160 --> 02:11.721
but no record of any pickup
from there that same day.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.925
I want you to expand the search.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.680
See if she got picked
up a few blocks away.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.051
Yes, sir.

02:19.320 --> 02:21.527
Where the hell are you?

02:29.440 --> 02:31.522
(INHALING DEEPLY)

02:51.320 --> 02:53.527
Time to see if this works.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.166
(TAPPING GLASS)

03:23.240 --> 03:24.526
(CLEARS THROAT)

03:25.600 --> 03:28.410
Well, as you may know,

03:28.520 --> 03:33.401
when we first met Rosalee,
we had some issues.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.562
And I'd like to take
this opportunity

03:35.640 --> 03:40.248
to publicly apologize
to Rosalee and my son,

03:40.320 --> 03:43.210
who, I must admit,
made us see things

03:43.280 --> 03:45.601
in ways I didn't think possible.

03:45.680 --> 03:49.127
Which leads me to extend
an apology to Nick,

03:49.200 --> 03:54.127
a Grimm, who taught me that this
world does move in mysterious ways.

03:54.200 --> 03:55.326
(LAUGHS)

03:55.400 --> 03:58.961
And finally, I want to
thank my wife, Alice,

04:00.000 --> 04:04.483
who refused to leave
when I really wanted to

04:05.480 --> 04:07.482
and made me face my
own bullheadedness.

04:08.280 --> 04:10.248
Without her courage and love,

04:10.320 --> 04:13.529
I would've totally
screwed up everything.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.011
(LAUGHTER)

04:15.840 --> 04:18.844
I just want to wish
Rosalee and Monroe

04:18.920 --> 04:22.811
a long, happy and
mysterious life together.

04:23.640 --> 04:25.051
ALL: Hear, hear.
Thanks, Dad.

04:25.160 --> 04:26.286
Thanks.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.250
Did you really just say that?

04:31.320 --> 04:33.004
I said it, and I meant it.

04:33.080 --> 04:34.445
Cheers.

04:35.960 --> 04:40.284
I would like to just briefly say
on behalf of Hank and myself,

04:40.360 --> 04:42.681
the resident
Kehrseite-Schlich-Kennen...

04:42.800 --> 04:44.768
Ahh!
(LAUGHTER)

04:44.840 --> 04:46.365
Thank you.

04:46.440 --> 04:51.401
That it has been a wonderful
and strange experience

04:51.520 --> 04:54.569
getting to know Monroe and
Rosalee and all of you.

04:54.640 --> 04:55.766
I'll drink 110 that.

04:55.840 --> 04:57.490
Not quite finished.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.089
So congratulations
to Rosalee and Monroe.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.844
You absolutely belong together,

05:01.920 --> 05:03.729
and here's to a fantastic
wedding tomorrow.

05:04.920 --> 05:05.921
ALL: Hear, hear.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
MONROE: Thanks, Juliette.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.371
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
RENARD: Who is it?

05:08.440 --> 05:09.520
JULIETTE: Is Adalind there?

05:12.480 --> 05:15.131
I really need to
talk to her and you.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.408
Nick told me you were
protecting Adalind here.

05:48.480 --> 05:49.845
I'm worried about her.

05:49.920 --> 05:52.287
Poor thing, she's lost her baby.

05:52.360 --> 05:54.601
She must be out of
her mind with grief.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.240
What happened to your forehead?

06:02.040 --> 06:03.690
Look, Julliette.

06:06.160 --> 06:10.290
You really don't want to get
involved with Adalind right now.

06:10.360 --> 06:11.441
She was in your house.

06:11.520 --> 06:13.204
When?
Yesterday.

06:14.160 --> 06:15.207
How do you know that?

06:15.280 --> 06:17.886
I followed her there.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.042
I don't know what she's up to,
but you need to be very careful.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.485
Adalind is capable of anything.

06:22.760 --> 06:24.560
You don't think she would
come after me again.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.490
I really don't know
what she's doing.

06:29.480 --> 06:30.686
When will she be back?

06:31.640 --> 06:33.290
I don't think she will be.

06:33.360 --> 06:36.728
I'm sorry. I know you
had feelings for her.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.962
Ours was always
a difficult relationship.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.201
So was ours.

06:43.120 --> 06:45.248
Yeah, that wasn't our fault.

06:45.320 --> 06:46.446
We had no control over it.

06:46.520 --> 06:48.727
You don't think there was
anything more than that?

06:50.680 --> 06:52.364
What? I have to be honest.

06:52.440 --> 06:53.805
No, you don't.

06:53.880 --> 06:56.406
I've been confused ever since we
went through what we went through.

06:56.520 --> 06:57.760
What do you mean "confused"?

06:57.840 --> 06:59.171
Just this.

07:06.520 --> 07:08.443
I'm sorry.
I know that was wrong.

07:08.520 --> 07:11.000
I can't help it. I still
have feelings for you.

07:11.080 --> 07:12.445
Call me.

07:22.360 --> 07:26.524
B & B Storage, 47466 Northwest Sutton Road.
And please hurry.

07:45.120 --> 07:48.761
Come on, I thought that
cabernet was delicious.

07:48.840 --> 07:50.330
Mom, stop.
Okay, guys.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.323
Anybody want anything else
before we go to sleep?

07:52.400 --> 07:53.447
Not me. I'm beat.

07:53.520 --> 07:54.521
We don't need anything.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.011
I could use another
glass of wine.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.448
(SIGHS) It's a special occasion.

08:01.880 --> 08:04.531
I mean, my baby sister
doesn't get married every day.

08:04.600 --> 08:07.285
Okay, red or white?

08:07.360 --> 08:09.124
Red.

08:09.200 --> 08:10.565
All right, I'll see
you all in the morning.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.483
Me too.
Yeah.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.607
Good night, son.

08:13.720 --> 08:15.320
Hey, Dad, can I talk
to you for a second?

08:16.920 --> 08:17.967
Is there a problem?

08:18.040 --> 08:19.690
No, no, not at all.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.649
Actually, that's what
I wanted to talk about.

08:21.720 --> 08:24.724
I just wanted to
say that I thought

08:24.800 --> 08:26.882
what you said at dinner
was really nice.

08:27.600 --> 08:30.171
And, you know,
I really appreciate

08:30.280 --> 08:32.442
how you've come around
to Rosalee and me.

08:33.440 --> 08:37.490
It was my problem, not yours.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.243
And now that we've
gotten to know her,

08:40.320 --> 08:43.529
that girl of yours
is pretty special.

08:44.159 --> 08:46.208
There will always be
some who won't agree,

08:46.280 --> 08:49.762
but I'm just glad I'm not
one of them anymore.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.850
Thanks, Dad.

08:52.280 --> 08:54.044
See you in the morning.
Okay.

09:18.640 --> 09:19.880
Do you smell smoke?

09:19.960 --> 09:21.166
Yeah, I do.

09:21.240 --> 09:22.401
I think it's coming from inside.

09:22.480 --> 09:23.561
(SMOKE ALARM BEEPING)

09:23.640 --> 09:24.846
Trubel!
(COUGHING)

09:26.080 --> 09:27.525
Sorry, sorry, I'm really sorry.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.647
I'll open a window.

09:28.720 --> 09:29.840
Yeah, and the door.
Get back.

09:29.920 --> 09:31.081
Okay.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.280
Sorry, I was just
trying to cook something.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.921
No, that's okay.
No harm done.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.843
Yeah, Nick almost burned
the house down once

09:40.920 --> 09:42.490
trying to make me
a birthday dinner.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.523
Some sort of flambÃ©, wasn't it?

09:44.600 --> 09:47.080
It was hard to tell after I was
done with it. We went out.

09:47.160 --> 09:49.080
I was just trying to cook
something for you guys.

09:49.640 --> 09:51.563
That's sweet. What were
you trying to make us?

09:51.640 --> 09:52.640
Bacon and eggs.

09:52.680 --> 09:55.160
If it worked, I was gonna
make breakfast, but...

09:55.800 --> 09:57.689
Oh, I never really
got past the bacon.

09:58.200 --> 09:59.531
Well, I can never
get past the bacon.

09:59.600 --> 10:00.647
I'm addicted.
(PHONE RINGING)

10:00.720 --> 10:02.529
I'll get the phone.

10:03.560 --> 10:06.962
And by the way,
I need your help tomorrow.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.691
We have something
important to do.

10:09.760 --> 10:11.205
What?

10:11.920 --> 10:13.046
We're moving the trailer.

10:13.520 --> 10:15.170
Hello?
Juliette.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.610
Adalind?
Hi.

10:18.720 --> 10:19.960
I'm so sorry to bother you,

10:20.040 --> 10:21.883
but I thought I should warn you.

10:21.960 --> 10:24.770
Something happened tonight that
I just can't quite explain.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.323
Why are you calling me?

10:27.400 --> 10:29.880
Because it's about you.

10:29.960 --> 10:31.041
Me? How is
it about me?

10:31.120 --> 10:33.009
I was with Sean tonight,
and he said

10:33.080 --> 10:35.128
some things that
just weren't right.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.804
I hope I'm wrong,

10:36.880 --> 10:39.929
but I think his obsession
for you may have returned,

10:40.000 --> 10:42.480
and I feel responsible.

10:42.560 --> 10:45.450
You haven't had any
feelings for him, have you?

10:45.520 --> 10:47.010
No. God, no.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.809
Good.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.360
I might be totally
wrong about this,

10:51.440 --> 10:53.090
but just in case,

10:53.160 --> 10:55.049
I'm gonna mix up a little
something to counteract it.

10:55.120 --> 10:58.920
No, Adalind. No mixing of anything.
No potions, please.

10:59.480 --> 11:01.721
I understand your concern.

11:01.800 --> 11:04.167
I just thought I
should say something.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.607
Anyway, you have a good night.

11:06.680 --> 11:08.284
No, Adal...

11:12.520 --> 11:13.521
Who was that?

11:13.600 --> 11:14.647
Adalind.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.681
Adalind?

11:19.760 --> 11:21.683
Who's Adalind?

11:21.760 --> 11:25.162
The Hexenbiest who put a spell on
Juliette and tried to kill her.

11:25.240 --> 11:26.321
Among other things.

11:26.400 --> 11:27.401
What did she want?

11:27.480 --> 11:30.211
She said that she thinks Sean's
obsession with me <i>is</i> coming back,

11:30.280 --> 11:31.406
and she wanted to warn me.

11:31.920 --> 11:33.046
Are you feeling anything?

11:33.120 --> 11:34.246
Yeah.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.607
Pissed off at the whole idea.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.721
She's probably wrong, and I
wouldn't trust her anyway.

11:40.800 --> 11:44.282
All I'm saying is, this better
not be happening again.

11:48.960 --> 11:50.200
(LOUD THUD)

11:51.760 --> 11:53.046
What was that?

11:53.120 --> 11:54.201
I don't know.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.645

Rosalee, I can't let you
get married in this dress.

12:06.040 --> 12:08.884
I won't let you
get married in it.

12:09.920 --> 12:12.207
I got married in it twice,

12:12.280 --> 12:14.169
and they both ended up
in the crapper.

12:14.640 --> 12:16.642
This dress is
nothing but bad luck.

12:17.840 --> 12:19.922

12:38.720 --> 12:40.290
This one is just stunning.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.850
It's beautiful.

for another hour.

12:44.760 --> 12:47.240
Oh, please, we really
need your help.

12:47.320 --> 12:48.731
She's getting married today.

12:48.800 --> 12:49.800
Her dress was ruined.

12:49.840 --> 12:50.921
It's a disaster.

12:51.040 --> 12:52.530
GLORIA: It was her sister.

12:52.600 --> 12:53.886
How much is that one?

12:54.000 --> 12:55.764
It's $7,200.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.968
Oh, that's way too expensive.

12:58.040 --> 13:00.088
Hell it is.
It's perfect.

13:00.160 --> 13:02.970
No, no, Monroe and I
can't afford it.

13:03.040 --> 13:04.371
We can.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.522
If they open
the store right now.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.921

open for business.

13:31.400 --> 13:32.890
I'm so sorry.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.291
I can never make this up to you.

Monroe, I...

13:37.400 --> 13:38.640
DeEtta, please.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.325
Just listen.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.328
(SIGHS) I'm gonna have
to be honest with you.

13:44.400 --> 13:45.970
Okay.

13:46.360 --> 13:47.930
Rosalee and I,

13:49.400 --> 13:51.084
we actually hated that dress.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.603
Hello?
RENARD: Juliette, it's me.

14:03.680 --> 14:05.967
Look, I don't know
how to say this,

14:06.040 --> 14:08.281
so I'm just gonna
come out and say it.

14:09.320 --> 14:12.529
I'm fond of you, but we
can't do this again.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.204
All right? It ends now. What?

14:14.280 --> 14:15.520
Look, you can't come and see me

14:15.600 --> 14:16.840
no matter how bad
you might want to.

14:16.960 --> 14:18.371
What are you talking about?

14:18.440 --> 14:20.408
Please don't play games.
This is serious.

14:20.480 --> 14:23.484
Yeah, I know this is serious.
Why are you calling me?

14:23.560 --> 14:26.166
To avoid getting into the same
problem we were in before.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.526
I don't want that.
Neither do I.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.204
So I think enough said.

14:29.280 --> 14:32.682
No, more than enough said.
What is wrong with you?

14:32.760 --> 14:34.046
Look, you're the one
who started this.

14:34.120 --> 14:36.202
I didn't start anything.
You called me.

14:36.280 --> 14:37.725
After you came to see me.

14:37.800 --> 14:40.724
That was last year,
and we both know why.

14:40.800 --> 14:41.961
And what about last night?

14:42.040 --> 14:43.405
What about last night?

14:43.480 --> 14:46.290
Wow! Really? That's how
you're gonna do this.

14:46.360 --> 14:48.931
No, this is how
I'm gonna do this.

but there's a unit registered
in her mother's name.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.085
Number 22.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.571
Want me to check it out?

15:12.680 --> 15:14.648

have to move it now?

it is, and we got this new stuff.

It seems like a good time
to find it a new home.

15:29.360 --> 15:30.930
I bought a piece of land.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.765
It's gonna be a lot harder for
people to figure out where it is.

15:33.840 --> 15:36.002
How many times have
you had to move it?

15:36.120 --> 15:37.963
This is the second time for me,

15:38.080 --> 15:40.731
but this came all the way from
New York with my Aunt Marie.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.325
That's who raised you,
your Aunt Marie?

dad until I was 12.

15:45.880 --> 15:46.927
What happened to them?

15:47.000 --> 15:48.809
My dad was killed,

15:49.360 --> 15:52.921
and I thought my mom was too
until a couple of years ago.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.126
Were they Grimms?

15:54.200 --> 15:56.441
My dad wasn't, and my mom was.

15:56.520 --> 15:57.885
Or is.

15:57.960 --> 15:59.121
You've seen her?

Oh, yeah.

had any trouble with Sean.

16:59.080 --> 17:00.844

Oh, no.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.890
You were right. There is
something wrong with him.

that'll make him stop.

but not for the face.

You spray it a little lower.

17:12.839 --> 17:14.444

No. No, I'm going out. I've got
way too many things to do.

just drop it off with him.

to go to a wedding, okay?

17:22.599 --> 17:23.567
He doesn't have time for this.

And by the way, this is
your responsibility, okay?

If Sean needs something
sprayed wherever, you do it.

18:14.920 --> 18:16.331
Why do you think he didn't
want to be a Grimm?

18:16.400 --> 18:19.449
He probably wanted
a normal life.

18:21.320 --> 18:22.526
That's possible?

18:22.600 --> 18:23.761
No.

to him in the end. Ooh!

or not, what would you do?

Well, it hasn't made
my life any easier.

that by myself.

me who you did it with?

do you think I am?

26:46.320 --> 26:48.004
I was gone. I was
getting my hair done.

26:48.080 --> 26:49.923
Yeah, you got your hair done.
It looked great.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.287
Stop. I cannot believe that you
would do something like this

26:52.360 --> 26:54.567
in our home, in our bed.

26:54.640 --> 26:56.324
All right, this isn't
funny anymore.

26:56.400 --> 26:58.129
If we weren't going to Monroe
and Rosalee's wedding,

26:58.200 --> 26:59.611
I would make you pull over,
and I would get out.

26:59.720 --> 27:02.690
Juliette, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

27:02.760 --> 27:04.250
Nick, you were in
bed with somebody.

27:04.320 --> 27:07.369
Yeah, I was in bed
with somebody, you.

27:07.440 --> 27:09.568
We made love.
We didn't.

27:09.640 --> 27:12.484
Okay, then it was somebody who
looked and sounded exactly like you,

27:12.560 --> 27:15.006
was in our bedroom, and was
wearing your negligee.

27:17.600 --> 27:18.761
Nick, it wasn't me.

27:20.880 --> 27:23.804
It had to have been you.
Who else could it have been?

27:29.720 --> 27:31.051
Adalind called me.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.368
Last night.
Today.

27:33.440 --> 27:36.603
She wanted to come over, and I
told her I was gonna be out.

27:38.480 --> 27:41.290
She knew you weren't
gonna be home.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.360
Oh, my God!

27:42.400 --> 27:43.686
If that was Adalind...

27:43.760 --> 27:45.603
Oh, my God!
I'm gonna be sick.

Who are you?

28:00.600 --> 28:02.489
Sean Renard. I'm Nick's captain.
Is he home?

28:03.080 --> 28:05.765
Look, I need to speak to him.
It's very important.

28:05.840 --> 28:08.241
Yeah, I remember you
from the police station.

28:09.400 --> 28:10.526
Nick. Nick!

28:10.600 --> 28:11.761
Nick's not home.

28:12.720 --> 28:13.720
Where is he?

28:13.760 --> 28:15.364
He went to the wedding with Juliette.
What's wrong?

28:15.440 --> 28:16.441
Who are you?

28:17.200 --> 28:19.601
I'm a friend of theirs. I'm just
staying with them for a while.

28:19.680 --> 28:20.681
Was Adalind here?

28:20.800 --> 28:22.211
I heard of her.
I don't know her.

28:22.280 --> 28:23.930
Long, blonde hair.
Pretty.

28:27.960 --> 28:29.166
You saw her, didn't you?

28:30.600 --> 28:33.285
I don't know. I saw
Juliette leave the house

28:33.360 --> 28:36.011
and then walk away
and get into a cab.

28:36.080 --> 28:37.730
And then she said
she didn't like bacon,

28:37.800 --> 28:41.088
which was weird, because
Juliette said she did.

28:42.240 --> 28:43.890
Anyway, I thought she got
into a fight with Nick,

28:43.960 --> 28:46.691
and then the cab drove past, and
it wasn't Juliette. It was...

28:46.760 --> 28:47.761
Adalind.

28:47.840 --> 28:49.040
I thought I saw two Juliettes.

28:49.120 --> 28:51.320
The one that you followed,
was she ever alone with Nick?

28:53.320 --> 28:55.926
Yeah, and she acted
like she didn't know me.

28:57.640 --> 28:58.880
Is Nick okay?

28:58.960 --> 29:00.291
No.

29:00.360 --> 29:01.720
No, and I need to
know where he is.

29:01.760 --> 29:04.889
Look, I know this sounds crazy,
but he has to drink this.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.121
What'd she do to him?

29:06.480 --> 29:09.404
Something very bad
if I don't get to him.

29:09.480 --> 29:10.561
You know where the wedding is?

29:10.640 --> 29:12.608
Yeah, hold on.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.526
It's...

29:16.760 --> 29:17.761
I should go with you.

29:17.840 --> 29:20.411
No, you stay here.
I'll handle this.

I would never have...

It's just this
whole life of ours,

30:15.520 --> 30:18.569

you are, you know?

30:20.560 --> 30:22.040
I don't know if I
can take it anymore.

30:22.560 --> 30:24.403
Juliette, I was going
to propose to you.

30:25.280 --> 30:27.760
I had the ring.
I was just about to,

30:28.240 --> 30:29.520
and that's when my mom showed up

30:29.560 --> 30:31.483
with Adalind and the baby...

30:31.600 --> 30:33.170
Nick, Juliette.

wonderful day or what?

30:36.200 --> 30:38.771
Hey, I'll see you both inside.

No, I know. I know
it's gonna be fine.

31:31.120 --> 31:34.727

this, like, a million times.

It wasn't a million times.

I forgot the sunglasses.

40:53.760 --> 40:55.444
The captain's been shot? And
I don't know who he was.

40:55.520 --> 40:59.445
He was just a Hundjager, and he's
the one that shot your captain.

40:59.560 --> 41:00.800
What...

41:02.200 --> 41:03.201
They're gonna tear her apart.

41:03.280 --> 41:04.281
You got to get her out of here.

41:04.360 --> 41:06.283
Nick, we got to go now.

41:13.360 --> 41:14.885
Oh, my God!

41:28.160 --> 41:29.161
(SPUTTERS)

42:07.120 --> 42:09.521
You really couldn't see 'em?

42:13.880 --> 42:15.086
No.
