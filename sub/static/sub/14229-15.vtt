01:13.790 --> 01:14.710
Ah!

01:14.710 --> 01:15.880
FRANCISCO:
Yes! Point!

01:15.880 --> 01:18.330
Bravo! Another win!

01:18.330 --> 01:19.830
Thanks, Abuelo!

01:19.830 --> 01:21.920
I don't remember teaching
you that move.

01:21.920 --> 01:23.580
I threw it in
at the last minute.

01:23.580 --> 01:25.880
Elena,
when I see you fence,

01:25.880 --> 01:27.790
it is like watching
your mother.

01:27.790 --> 01:30.040
She was quite the fencer
in her day.

01:30.040 --> 01:31.170
So I've heard.

01:31.170 --> 01:32.670
Ready
for another round, Gabe?

01:32.670 --> 01:34.460
I promise
I'll go easy on you.

01:34.460 --> 01:36.920
Sorry, Princess,
but I have to head
down to the arena.

01:36.920 --> 01:38.830
Sign-ups start today
for the Swordsman's Cup,

01:38.830 --> 01:41.210
and the
Royal Guards are helping
set up the tournament.

01:41.210 --> 01:43.500
I can't wait to see
all that great swordplay.

01:43.500 --> 01:44.880
Maybe pick up
some new moves.

01:44.880 --> 01:48.250
Let me walk you out,
Lieutenant.

01:48.250 --> 01:50.620
Oh! Gabe,
don't forget your--

01:52.000 --> 01:54.920
Thank you for teaching
Elena how to fence.

01:54.920 --> 01:56.460
And for letting her win.

01:56.460 --> 01:57.710
What?!

01:57.710 --> 01:59.920
You've been letting me win
all this time?

01:59.920 --> 02:01.620
I-- I... Uh...

02:01.620 --> 02:02.920
It was my idea.

02:02.920 --> 02:04.540
I don't want you
to get hurt.

02:04.540 --> 02:06.380
I'm not going to get hurt,
Abuelo.

02:06.380 --> 02:08.750
Your mother
was the best fencer
in the kingdom,

02:08.750 --> 02:10.710
and even she got injured.

02:10.710 --> 02:13.120
You never told me that.
How?

02:13.120 --> 02:16.330
My Lucia entered
the Swordsman's Cup once.

02:16.330 --> 02:17.790
She made it
to the final round

02:17.790 --> 02:19.880
against a knight
from Brazendell.

02:19.880 --> 02:23.380
But she broke
her wrist and had
to forfeit the match.

02:23.380 --> 02:25.170
I would never forgive myself

02:25.170 --> 02:27.750
if I let something
like that happen again.

02:27.750 --> 02:30.920
Just because she got hurt
doesn't mean I will.

02:30.920 --> 02:32.120
I cannot take that risk.

02:32.120 --> 02:34.670
You are the Crown Princess
of Avalor.

02:34.670 --> 02:37.250
But more importantly,
you are my granddaughter.

02:37.250 --> 02:40.460
Please try to understand.

02:40.460 --> 02:42.080
And you went along
with this?

02:42.080 --> 02:44.120
I'm sorry.
But I'm your royal guard.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.710
I'm supposed to protect you.

02:45.710 --> 02:48.120
I don't need
to be protected.

02:48.120 --> 02:50.500
I'll show you.
I'll show both of you.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.040
What do you mean, show us?

02:52.040 --> 02:54.080
I'm going to enter
the fencing tournament.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.880
There is no way

02:55.880 --> 02:57.540
your grandfather is
going to let you do that.

02:57.540 --> 02:59.830
Ah! You're right.

03:05.500 --> 03:08.330
So I'm not going
to let him know it's me.

03:08.330 --> 03:10.120
I'll just pretend
to be a knight

03:10.120 --> 03:11.830
from a faraway kingdom!

03:11.830 --> 03:14.120
You still sound like
the Crown Princess.

03:14.120 --> 03:16.500
I don't need to talk.
Just win.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.500
That's going to be harder
than you think.

03:18.500 --> 03:20.750
You haven't seen
who you're up against.

03:23.750 --> 03:25.790
They call him
The Viper because
of his quick strikes.

03:27.460 --> 03:29.460
They call her
The Hornet

03:29.460 --> 03:30.920
because
her footwork's so good,

03:30.920 --> 03:32.120
it's like she's flying.

03:32.120 --> 03:34.500
They call him
The Beast...

03:37.290 --> 03:38.330
...because he...

03:38.330 --> 03:39.500
OPPONENT: Whoa!

03:39.500 --> 03:41.120
( crash,
cat yowls )

03:41.120 --> 03:43.500
Yeah, I think I know why.

03:43.500 --> 03:46.790
And that right there
is Sir Cassius.

03:52.250 --> 03:54.710
What are you doing,
Cassius!

03:54.710 --> 03:56.620
You don't stop
in the middle of a point!

03:56.620 --> 03:58.250
It's just practice, Father.

03:58.250 --> 04:00.210
Well, you're practicing
bad habits.

04:00.210 --> 04:01.750
Yes, Father.

04:01.750 --> 04:03.790
Now get back in there
and win the point!

04:03.790 --> 04:06.170
Sir Cassius is Brazendell's
defending champion.

04:06.170 --> 04:07.920
Brazendell?

04:07.920 --> 04:10.330
Didn't Abuelo say
my mother dueled a knight
from Brazendell?

04:10.330 --> 04:11.790
He's not
a knight anymore.

04:11.790 --> 04:12.880
He's Lord Elrod.

04:12.880 --> 04:15.170
Point! That's more like it!

04:15.170 --> 04:16.790
So, seen enough?

04:16.790 --> 04:19.330
Yep. Where do I sign up?

04:20.540 --> 04:23.500
Welcome
to the Swordsman Cup...

04:23.500 --> 04:25.500
um... Sir Elezar!

04:25.500 --> 04:27.250
Mm! Mm-hmm! Whoa!

04:27.250 --> 04:28.880
This is not a good idea.

04:28.880 --> 04:30.290
You saw the other fencers.

04:30.290 --> 04:31.580
I can beat them.

04:31.580 --> 04:33.330
Elena,
you can't even beat me

04:33.330 --> 04:34.790
when I'm
not letting you win.

04:34.790 --> 04:36.580
Is that so?

04:36.580 --> 04:37.880
GABE: En garde!

04:39.880 --> 04:41.880
Point.

04:41.880 --> 04:43.380
Let's go again.

04:44.750 --> 04:46.670
Point.
Again!

04:50.290 --> 04:51.290
En garde!

04:53.380 --> 04:54.500
Point.

04:54.500 --> 04:55.710
What was that?

04:55.710 --> 04:57.790
I call it
the "Leaping Stag."

04:57.790 --> 05:00.290
I used that move
to win the Royal Guard
fencing match last year.

05:02.120 --> 05:03.750
I thought I was good.

05:03.750 --> 05:05.420
But I'm not even okay.

05:05.420 --> 05:07.790
Listen, you're
better than okay.

05:07.790 --> 05:09.830
But if you want to get
to tournament level,

05:09.830 --> 05:12.080
you have a lot to learn.

05:12.080 --> 05:13.750
You're right.

05:13.750 --> 05:16.000
So I'm going to need you
to teach me.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.710
I want you to be my coach.

05:17.710 --> 05:19.750
Your coach?
No way.

05:19.750 --> 05:21.120
Why not?

05:21.120 --> 05:22.710
You're the best fencer
in the Royal Guard.

05:22.710 --> 05:24.620
You know
all those great moves.

05:24.620 --> 05:26.750
Plus, I trained you
in Olaball.

05:26.750 --> 05:28.750
The least you could do
is coach me.

05:28.750 --> 05:30.540
If I coach you,

05:30.540 --> 05:32.460
you're going to have
to train the way I trained,

05:32.460 --> 05:34.040
and you're
not going to like it.

05:34.040 --> 05:37.080
I'll do whatever you say.
I promise.

05:37.080 --> 05:39.920
All right. We start
tomorrow morning at five.

05:39.920 --> 05:42.080
Ooh, can we make it seven?

05:42.080 --> 05:43.460
I'm not really
a morning person.

05:44.670 --> 05:45.670
Five it is!

05:49.080 --> 05:50.500
Huh!

05:50.500 --> 05:51.920
Wha

05:51.920 --> 05:53.460
We're burning daylight!
Let's go! Let's go!

05:53.460 --> 05:54.880
Uh-huh.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.880
Aah! Oh!

05:56.880 --> 05:57.880
I'm okay.

06:01.250 --> 06:03.540
Why do I have to go up
all these steps?

06:03.540 --> 06:05.920
If you want to be a great
fencer, you need endurance

06:05.920 --> 06:07.500
so you can outlast
your opponent.

06:12.540 --> 06:13.790
Ooh!

06:19.830 --> 06:22.120
You need balance
so you can stay on your feet.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.620
Whoa! Whoa!

06:23.620 --> 06:24.920
Ha!

06:24.920 --> 06:26.830
Whoaaa!

06:28.420 --> 06:29.420
Ha!

06:31.170 --> 06:32.830
You need
speed and footwork

06:32.830 --> 06:34.380
so you can
dodge and strike.

06:34.380 --> 06:35.540
Hey!

06:35.540 --> 06:36.540
Gabe!

06:36.540 --> 06:37.620
Ow!

06:38.920 --> 06:40.120
You're lucky
I'm using mangoes.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.040
My instructor used coconuts.

06:42.040 --> 06:43.920
We've been at this all day.

06:43.920 --> 06:46.330
When are you going
to teach me some sword moves?

06:46.330 --> 06:47.880
You're not ready
for a sword.

06:47.880 --> 06:50.540
But the competition
is in two days!

06:50.540 --> 06:54.500
And if it was
a complaining contest,
you'd be ready to go.

06:54.500 --> 06:57.250
Look, if you want to win,
you need to step up.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.170
I am stepping up!

06:59.170 --> 07:00.380
Then show me.

You're ready for a sword.

08:47.210 --> 08:48.580
Yes!

08:53.420 --> 08:55.880
Side step, side step!

08:55.880 --> 08:57.750
Now lunge!

08:57.750 --> 08:59.500
Strike!

09:00.710 --> 09:02.040
Ha!
Point!

09:02.040 --> 09:04.750
Can I try
your "Leaping Llama" move?

09:04.750 --> 09:07.830
It's "Leaping Stag."
And that move is too risky.

09:07.830 --> 09:09.210
If you don't time it
just right,

09:09.210 --> 09:10.710
your opponent has
an easy strike.

09:10.710 --> 09:13.460
You either win or lose.
No in between.

09:13.460 --> 09:14.790
I want to try it.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.170
All right.

09:17.170 --> 09:19.040
En garde.

09:20.830 --> 09:22.670
Point!

09:22.670 --> 09:23.710
Ugh!

09:23.710 --> 09:25.040
See what I mean?

09:25.040 --> 09:27.540
Let me try again.
I'll get the hang of it.

09:27.540 --> 09:29.620
Let's stick
with the safer moves.

09:29.620 --> 09:30.670
Now lunge!

09:31.710 --> 09:32.710
Point!

09:32.710 --> 09:33.960
There you go!

09:35.790 --> 09:38.170
GABE: Okay,
the tournament rules
are simple.

09:38.170 --> 09:40.000
Tap your opponent
and you get a point.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.750
You need three points
to win the round.

09:41.750 --> 09:43.420
If you win, you advance.

09:43.420 --> 09:45.420
If you lose,
you're out.

09:45.420 --> 09:46.960
Great. I'm ready.

09:46.960 --> 09:49.380
Now let's see who
your first opponent is.

09:49.380 --> 09:51.790
Rrarr!

09:51.790 --> 09:52.790
I'm not ready.

09:52.790 --> 09:54.420
All right.
I have an idea.

09:54.420 --> 09:56.920
The Beast is big,
but that can also make him slow.

09:56.920 --> 09:59.000
So if you use your speed
and strike first,

09:59.000 --> 10:00.540
you'll throw him
off his game.

10:00.540 --> 10:01.880
Lunge and attack.

10:01.880 --> 10:04.460
Lunge and attack. Got it.

10:04.460 --> 10:07.670
Wait. Your grandparents are
gonna be in the crowd.

10:07.670 --> 10:09.830
So if you really wanna go
through with this,

10:09.830 --> 10:12.670
you better make sure no one
finds out it's you.

10:14.120 --> 10:15.960
In our first bout,

10:15.960 --> 10:20.960
we have newcomer
Sir Elezar versus The Beast!

10:24.290 --> 10:27.330
Don't blink. This fight
should be over fast.

10:27.330 --> 10:29.040
Lunge and attack.

10:29.040 --> 10:30.120
En garde!

10:30.120 --> 10:31.120
Begin!

10:36.080 --> 10:37.250
Huh?

10:37.250 --> 10:38.750
REFEREE:
One point! Sir Elezar!

10:38.750 --> 10:39.750
Rrr!

10:41.040 --> 10:42.670
Yes!

10:42.670 --> 10:45.500
Okay! Gabe was right!

10:45.500 --> 10:47.000
En garde! Continue!

10:49.880 --> 10:50.880
Rrr!

10:50.880 --> 10:51.880
Two points! Sir Elezar!

10:51.880 --> 10:52.880
Yes!

10:52.880 --> 10:53.880
Sir Elezar is good.

10:55.420 --> 10:57.120
He's about to find out
what happens

10:57.120 --> 10:59.290
when you poke a beast
too many times.

10:59.290 --> 11:01.040
En garde! Continue!

11:01.040 --> 11:02.250
Rrr!

11:02.250 --> 11:03.670
Unh!
Whoop!

11:04.920 --> 11:06.880
REFEREE:
Three Points! Sir Elezar!

11:06.880 --> 11:08.750
Sir Elezar
is the winner!

11:11.250 --> 11:14.170
Sir Elezar
is very impressive.

11:14.170 --> 11:16.920
Lieutenant Nuñez,
have you seen Elena?

11:16.920 --> 11:18.670
Uh, let me go find her.

11:21.880 --> 11:24.380
I beat The Beast!
Three-zip!

11:24.380 --> 11:26.540
Yeah, but we have to talk
about your next opponent:

11:26.540 --> 11:27.540
The Viper.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.620
Yes. Thank you.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.540
Sir Cassius
just beat The Hornet.

11:34.540 --> 11:37.290
That's great,
but you need to focus
on The Viper.

11:37.290 --> 11:39.790
If I could beat The Beast,
I can beat The Viper.

11:39.790 --> 11:41.750
Yes, but not the same way.

11:41.750 --> 11:44.750
The Viper is quick,
so you need to hang back.

11:44.750 --> 11:47.290
Don't attack.
Use your footwork
to wear him down.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.880
He's used
to winning fast,

11:48.880 --> 11:50.880
so you have to
play it safe
and wear him out.

11:50.880 --> 11:52.460
Don't worry. I got this.

11:55.290 --> 11:59.710
REFEREE: Round two.
Sir Elezar versus The Viper!

11:59.710 --> 12:01.420
En garde! Begin!

12:03.330 --> 12:04.710
What are you doing?

12:04.710 --> 12:06.500
I said play it safe.

12:10.790 --> 12:12.380
One point! The Viper!

12:12.380 --> 12:14.710
He's really quick.

12:14.710 --> 12:16.080
En garde!

12:16.080 --> 12:17.750
Continue!

12:20.580 --> 12:21.830
REFEREE:
Two points! The Viper!

12:21.830 --> 12:23.750
I'll be right back.

12:25.290 --> 12:28.380
Looks like Sir Elezar is
about to get snakebit.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.670
Ele-- Sir Elezar!

12:31.670 --> 12:33.250
I told you
to play it safe.

12:33.250 --> 12:35.880
Be patient.
Use your footwork.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.170
Right. Play it safe.

12:37.170 --> 12:39.580
Not my strong suit,
but okay.

12:39.580 --> 12:41.080
REFEREE: En garde!

12:42.120 --> 12:43.120
REFEREE: Continue!

12:53.670 --> 12:54.920
Aah!

12:54.920 --> 12:56.710
Yes!

12:56.710 --> 12:59.000
One point! Sir Elezar!

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
En garde!

13:00.000 --> 13:01.460
Continue!

13:02.710 --> 13:04.380
Come on, come on.

13:09.790 --> 13:10.920
Aah!

13:10.920 --> 13:12.500
REFEREE:
Two points! Sir Elezar!

13:12.500 --> 13:14.790
The Viper looks tired.

13:16.920 --> 13:18.500
One more point.

13:18.500 --> 13:19.540
Move those feet.

13:19.540 --> 13:20.540
REFEREE: En garde!

13:20.540 --> 13:21.540
Continue!

13:30.080 --> 13:31.170
Aah!

13:31.170 --> 13:32.710
Yeah!

13:32.710 --> 13:34.330
Sir Elezar wins!

13:35.710 --> 13:36.920
Bravo!

13:36.920 --> 13:38.330
Whoo-hoo!

13:38.330 --> 13:39.330
Ahem!

13:39.330 --> 13:40.710
Yeah.

13:40.710 --> 13:43.380
Tomorrow, Sir Elezar
will face Sir Cassius

13:43.380 --> 13:46.120
in the final round
of the Swordsman's Cup!

13:46.120 --> 13:47.170
Hmm.

13:47.170 --> 13:48.540
Come along, Cassius.

13:48.540 --> 13:52.120
It's time I teach you
a few new moves.

13:52.120 --> 13:56.880
Sir Elezar! Outstanding
performance today.

13:56.880 --> 13:58.750
We would like to invite you
to the palace

13:58.750 --> 14:01.710
for tea this afternoon
as our guest of honor.

14:01.710 --> 14:03.750
No!

14:03.750 --> 14:05.580
A man of few words, huh?

14:05.580 --> 14:08.330
I will take that
as a yes!

14:08.330 --> 14:12.790
Lieutenant Nuñez, please escort
Sir Elezar to the palace.

14:12.790 --> 14:15.330
Tea at the palace

14:15.330 --> 14:16.710
I grunted "no!"

14:16.710 --> 14:18.380
You can't keep this up.

14:18.380 --> 14:20.620
You have to tell him
the truth.

14:20.620 --> 14:22.960
If I do, he'll never
let me fence in the finals.

14:22.960 --> 14:25.500
I've come too far.
I can't stop now.

14:25.500 --> 14:26.790
MAN: Sir Elezar!

14:26.790 --> 14:28.170
You're the best!

14:28.170 --> 14:29.500
Ooh!
Uh, sign my pennant!

14:29.500 --> 14:31.080
Oh, no. Come on.

14:31.080 --> 14:32.880
Sneak out the back.

14:32.880 --> 14:34.330
I'll pull
the carriage around.

14:34.330 --> 14:36.580
Is Sir Elezar
coming out?

14:36.580 --> 14:37.710
Sir Elezar went that way!

14:37.710 --> 14:39.750
Come on!
Let's go talk to him!

14:39.750 --> 14:42.540
SIR CASSIUS: You saw
Sir Elezar duel The Viper.

14:42.540 --> 14:44.580
He's the best
I've seen in years.

14:44.580 --> 14:47.670
What you need is an advanced
technique to beat him.

14:47.670 --> 14:52.250
I used it against a particularly
formidable opponent years ago.

14:52.250 --> 14:56.750
Princess Elena's mother.
Queen Lucia.

14:56.750 --> 14:58.580
When our swords crossed,

14:58.580 --> 15:01.830
I knocked the bell guard
against her wrist. Like this.

15:03.580 --> 15:05.170
Isn't that
against the rules?

15:05.170 --> 15:08.790
Only if the referee thinks
you did it on purpose.

15:08.790 --> 15:12.120
It will weaken Sir Elezar,
and you'll win the bout.

15:12.120 --> 15:15.540
In my case, Queen Lucia
broke her wrist
and had to withdraw.

15:16.920 --> 15:18.330
SIR CASSIUS:
But it was cheating.

15:18.330 --> 15:20.080
I don't want to cheat.

15:20.080 --> 15:21.960
You don't want
to be the first person
in our family

15:21.960 --> 15:24.920
to lose the tournament,
do you?

15:24.920 --> 15:27.790
A winner does
what it takes to win.

15:29.170 --> 15:30.670
Yes, Father.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.540
Ohh!

15:40.750 --> 15:41.880
What took you so long?

15:41.880 --> 15:44.120
I'll tell you later.
Let's go.

15:51.960 --> 15:53.670
Welcome! Welcome!

15:53.670 --> 15:56.830
We're so pleased
you could make it, Sir Elezar.

15:56.830 --> 15:59.460
This is my wife, Luisa.

15:59.460 --> 16:00.880
It's so nice to meet you.

16:00.880 --> 16:02.620
We must get Elena
down here.

16:02.620 --> 16:03.790
No!

16:03.790 --> 16:05.750
What Sir Elezar said was...

16:05.750 --> 16:07.750
he wants to wait
to meet the Princess

16:07.750 --> 16:09.920
until after he wins
the championship.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.330
That's the spirit!

16:11.330 --> 16:13.000
You got all that
from a grunt?

16:13.000 --> 16:14.330
Yep!

16:14.330 --> 16:15.580
FRANCISCO:
Please sit down.

16:15.580 --> 16:16.620
Lieutenant Nuñez,

16:16.620 --> 16:18.500
take Sir Elezar's helmet.

16:19.710 --> 16:21.750
Uh, actually, Sir Elezar
likes to keep it on...

16:21.750 --> 16:23.290
to maintain his focus.

16:23.290 --> 16:24.830
It's one
of his fencing rituals.

16:24.830 --> 16:26.540
He wears it
the whole tournament.

16:26.540 --> 16:29.710
But isn't it hard
to drink tea
with a helmet on?

16:29.710 --> 16:31.170
Not if you have a straw!

16:31.170 --> 16:34.710
A straw
for Sir Elezar, please!

16:34.710 --> 16:39.330
I wouldn't want
to break your impressive
winning streak.

16:39.330 --> 16:43.080
After all, you're facing
Sir Cassius in the finals.

16:43.080 --> 16:45.080
His father, Lord Elrod,

16:45.080 --> 16:47.080
defeated my daughter
in the finals years ago.

16:47.080 --> 16:50.330
So we're hoping
you will beat his son.

16:50.330 --> 16:51.460
Oh, I will!

16:51.460 --> 16:52.460
Uh!

16:52.460 --> 16:56.250
Elena

16:59.710 --> 17:03.540
You are Sir Elezar?

17:03.540 --> 17:05.460
I'm sorry, Abuelo,

17:05.460 --> 17:06.790
but I thought it was
the only way

17:06.790 --> 17:08.710
to prove to you
I'm a great fencer.

17:08.710 --> 17:10.420
That was never the point.

17:10.420 --> 17:13.830
Your mother was the best,
and she still got hurt.

17:13.830 --> 17:15.920
Abuelo, it was
not an accident.

17:15.920 --> 17:18.790
Lord Elrod injured her
on purpose.

17:18.790 --> 17:20.750
On purpose?
He cheated?

17:20.750 --> 17:22.210
Is that what you were
gonna tell me later?

17:22.210 --> 17:25.120
Yes. I overheard him
talking about it.

17:25.120 --> 17:27.330
That's why I have to fight.

17:27.330 --> 17:29.790
And what if his son
tries the same move with you?

17:29.790 --> 17:31.710
I'm ready for it.

17:31.710 --> 17:33.500
I know you're
just looking
out for me, Abuelo,

17:33.500 --> 17:36.080
but you have to let me
stand up for myself--

17:36.080 --> 17:37.710
and my mother.

17:37.710 --> 17:39.170
She's right, Francisco.

17:39.170 --> 17:40.920
We have to let her do this.

17:40.920 --> 17:43.580
If you feel you must.

17:43.580 --> 17:44.750
Thanks, Abuelo!

17:44.750 --> 17:47.120
Now go out there and win one
for our familia!

17:49.210 --> 17:51.790
One final duel will determine

17:51.790 --> 17:53.880
the champion
of the Swordsman's Cup!

17:53.880 --> 17:56.080
Sir Elezar!

17:59.920 --> 18:04.540
And Brazendell's defending
champion, Sir Cassius!

18:04.540 --> 18:06.960
Don't blow this,
Cassius.

18:09.830 --> 18:12.000
Three points wins
the championship.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.330
En garde!

18:15.960 --> 18:17.420
Begin!

18:29.420 --> 18:30.710
One point. Sir Cassius.

18:31.960 --> 18:34.920
He's good.
But you can do this.

18:34.920 --> 18:35.920
En garde!

18:35.920 --> 18:37.750
Continue!

18:40.750 --> 18:41.830
A little footwork.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.290
REFEREE:
One point. Sir Elezar.

18:47.290 --> 18:49.170
Yes!

18:49.170 --> 18:52.420
Yes! Go Elen-- Elezar!

18:52.420 --> 18:53.670
Continue!

18:59.540 --> 19:00.750
REFEREE:
Two points! Sir Elezar!

19:00.750 --> 19:01.830
One more.

19:02.790 --> 19:05.250
Cassius,
go for the wrist.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.120
REFEREE: En garde!

19:12.120 --> 19:13.790
Continue!

19:16.210 --> 19:17.750
Oh, no, you don't!

19:17.750 --> 19:19.620
Aah! Ohh!

19:21.250 --> 19:23.250
Two points! Sir Cassius!

19:23.250 --> 19:25.750
Aah! My ankle!

19:25.750 --> 19:26.830
No!
No!

19:28.750 --> 19:32.540
You missed. It's lucky
for you he tripped.

19:32.540 --> 19:34.830
You okay?
Sir Elezar,

19:34.830 --> 19:36.920
you must continue
or forfeit the match.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.960
Please just give him
a minute, will you?

19:38.960 --> 19:40.750
You have one minute.
That is all.

19:43.830 --> 19:44.790
Ow! Ow!

19:44.790 --> 19:47.170
Well, it's not broken.

19:47.170 --> 19:48.620
Elena!

19:48.620 --> 19:49.750
ELENA: I know what
you're gonna say,

19:49.750 --> 19:51.580
and I'm not
about to give up.

19:51.580 --> 19:54.420
I hope not. You've come
too far to quit now.

19:54.420 --> 19:56.750
I just came to give you this.

19:59.170 --> 20:00.920
Mami...

20:00.920 --> 20:02.750
LUISA: Keep it close
to your heart.

20:02.750 --> 20:04.710
It will give you strength.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.580
We cannot wait anymore.

20:12.580 --> 20:14.500
It looks like you are the--

20:16.120 --> 20:19.920
REFEREE: Whoever scores
the next point, wins the Cup.

20:23.460 --> 20:25.460
En garde!

20:25.460 --> 20:27.330
Continue!

20:32.960 --> 20:34.960
She can barely move.

20:37.540 --> 20:38.620
What am I gonna do?

20:44.290 --> 20:45.830
I know.

20:47.290 --> 20:48.830
Attack, Cassius!

20:51.620 --> 20:52.710
Unh!
Ahh!

20:59.540 --> 21:00.830
I did it!

21:00.830 --> 21:03.830
She did it!
The Leaping Stag!

21:03.830 --> 21:07.710
Sir Elezar is the winner!

21:09.620 --> 21:12.500
Yes!
Yeah!

21:17.040 --> 21:18.960
MAN:
Princess Elena?!

21:18.960 --> 21:20.460
Princess Elena?!

21:21.750 --> 21:22.830
It's the Princess!

21:24.790 --> 21:26.540
Elena!

21:26.540 --> 21:28.080
Nice move.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.080
I told you
I'd get the hang of it.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.790
SIR CASSIUS:
Congratulations!

21:31.790 --> 21:33.750
What are you doing?

21:33.750 --> 21:35.830
What you should
have done years ago.

21:35.830 --> 21:40.580
Giving the trophy
to the person
who deserves it.

21:40.580 --> 21:44.330
You should go
before I challenge you
to a duel.
