of each other,

One was brought into the morgue.

03:33.827 --> 03:36.162
The other is still on scene
at Sinclair Park.

03:36.196 --> 03:37.864
What's the connection?

03:37.898 --> 03:40.333
They were both students
at Mendel Academy.

03:40.367 --> 03:42.268
And it wasn't something
they were exposed to on campus.

03:42.302 --> 03:44.070

anybody where I am,

04:05.959 --> 04:07.960
where I was, what time
I arrived or what time I left.

04:07.995 --> 04:10.096
Captain Maldonado is
our commanding officer.

04:10.130 --> 04:12.698
She's on a need-to-know basis.
Protect, serve, cover.

04:12.733 --> 04:14.166
You want me to cover for you,
why don't you tell me

04:14.201 --> 04:15.601
why you turned off
your locator chip

04:15.602 --> 04:17.168
for two hours this morning?

04:17.204 --> 04:18.271
What you don't know
can't hurt me.

04:18.305 --> 04:20.172
It's my job to know about you.

04:20.207 --> 04:22.074
You're not just a badge number
and a questionable haircut.

04:22.108 --> 04:23.075
Ha-ha.

04:23.110 --> 04:26.646
What do we got?

04:26.680 --> 04:29.081
(bees buzzing) Was she stung?

04:29.116 --> 04:31.117
No bee stings on her.

04:31.151 --> 04:33.119
Coroner didn't see any signs

04:33.153 --> 04:35.388
of an allergic reaction.

04:41.461 --> 04:43.362
Stahl, Kennex.

04:43.397 --> 04:44.830
Captain says we might be

04:44.865 --> 04:46.132
working the same case.

04:46.166 --> 04:47.800
Yeah, maybe so.

04:47.834 --> 04:49.201
You got a cause of death?

04:49.236 --> 04:50.736
They're calling it
cardiac arrest.

04:50.771 --> 04:52.371
Which means they don't know.

04:52.406 --> 04:54.073
My girl's pupils are fixed

04:54.107 --> 04:56.142
and abnormally dilated.
How about yours?

04:56.176 --> 04:57.710
They're huge, I've never
seen anything like it.

04:57.744 --> 04:59.011
You thinking O.D.?

04:59.046 --> 05:01.347
Yeah, but from what
I don't know.

05:01.381 --> 05:03.282
The hospital ran
a standard drug panel.

05:03.317 --> 05:05.084
It assays over 300 substances.

05:05.118 --> 05:06.319
Elinor came up clean.

05:06.353 --> 05:08.354
Well, something
stopped their hearts.

05:08.388 --> 05:10.828
There's always something new and
exciting hitting the streets.

05:10.857 --> 05:12.758
I sent a blood sample
to our lab.

05:12.793 --> 05:14.393
If there's something in this
girl, we'll figure it out.

05:14.428 --> 05:15.661
I just found
some kind of container

05:15.696 --> 05:18.164
in her pocket.

05:19.600 --> 05:20.954
It's sealed.

05:20.973 --> 05:22.133
You got your vic's personals?

05:22.141 --> 05:23.775
Just got them.

05:23.809 --> 05:25.343
There's not much here.

05:27.613 --> 05:29.014
John?

05:29.048 --> 05:30.048
You still there?

05:30.082 --> 05:31.716
You okay?

05:31.751 --> 05:33.818
Yeah, yeah, keep going.

05:35.251 --> 05:36.931
The container has
a biometric lock circuit.

05:36.956 --> 05:38.289
It's activated

05:38.324 --> 05:39.758
by an individual's DNA.

05:39.792 --> 05:41.059
I have one, too.

05:45.865 --> 05:47.532
It's empty.

05:47.566 --> 05:48.666
Mine, too.

05:48.701 --> 05:50.702
Well, we better find out

05:50.736 --> 05:52.137
what was inside...

05:52.171 --> 05:54.239
before we find
any more dead kids.

06:00.646 --> 06:02.514
The parents don't know
anything about drugs.

06:02.548 --> 06:04.416
At least nothing they'll admit.

06:04.450 --> 06:06.484
The kids were chromes.

06:06.519 --> 06:08.453
Genetically engineered.

06:08.487 --> 06:11.656
I need you to liaison
with the parents.

06:11.690 --> 06:13.858
They'll respond better
to one of their own.

06:15.661 --> 06:16.995
I don't think that's
a good idea.

06:17.029 --> 06:19.597
I-I tend to rub them
the wrong way.

06:19.632 --> 06:21.132
You know their world.

06:22.735 --> 06:24.869
All right.

06:34.447 --> 06:38.149
FEMALE COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
Accessing victim profiles.

06:38.184 --> 06:41.086
We were right, this is new.

06:41.120 --> 06:43.054
What is it?

06:43.089 --> 06:44.489
The drug found
in the blood of our victims

06:44.523 --> 06:47.392
contains a metabolite,
a breakdown compound

06:47.426 --> 06:48.993
that indicates the presence
of a drug or toxin.

06:49.028 --> 06:50.628
Like what? Upper? Downer?

06:50.663 --> 06:52.197
Euphoric? Tremble stim?
Hallucinogen?

06:52.231 --> 06:53.465
What are we talking about?

06:53.499 --> 06:54.732
Good question.

06:54.767 --> 06:56.088
I thought chromes
didn't do drugs.

06:56.102 --> 06:57.702
Generally they don't.

06:57.736 --> 06:59.504
But that doesn't mean
they don't experiment.

06:59.538 --> 07:01.106
They just don't have
addiction issues.

07:01.140 --> 07:02.507
Those genetic defects

07:02.541 --> 07:04.409
get corrected in the womb.

07:04.443 --> 07:05.844
Well, these two girls
definitely experimented.

07:05.878 --> 07:07.946
Apparently three girls did.

07:07.980 --> 07:09.447
The same compound

07:09.482 --> 07:10.748
was also found in the blood

07:10.783 --> 07:12.350
of a girl
who died seven months ago.

07:12.384 --> 07:14.452
Lila Hoving, age 15.

07:14.487 --> 07:16.321
Also a student
at Mendel Academy.

07:16.355 --> 07:18.656
I'll look into it,
see if the girls were friends.

07:18.691 --> 07:20.158
This one's different.

07:20.192 --> 07:21.493
She didn't O.D., she drowned.

07:21.527 --> 07:22.760
She could've been
on her way to an O.D.,

07:22.795 --> 07:24.429
and drowned
before her heart stopped.

07:24.463 --> 07:25.763
The original investigation
couldn't find

07:25.798 --> 07:27.699
any conclusive evidence
of drug use.

07:27.733 --> 07:29.601
Well, we've got more bodies
than they do.

07:29.635 --> 07:31.369
There's a ton of chatter
between these girls

07:31.403 --> 07:32.370
on social networks.

07:32.404 --> 07:33.872
They were definitely friends.

07:33.906 --> 07:35.540
Take a team to the school

07:35.574 --> 07:36.808
and see what you can find out.

07:36.842 --> 07:38.209
We'll meet you there

07:38.244 --> 07:39.210
after we talk to the mother

07:39.245 --> 07:41.146
- of the girl who drowned.
- Okay.

08:31.475 --> 08:32.908
I know you've been
taking Membliss, John.

08:32.943 --> 08:35.277
I'm required to give updates

08:35.312 --> 08:38.380
on your mental and physical
condition every 72 hours.

08:38.414 --> 08:39.881
You thought
I wouldn't detect it?

08:39.916 --> 08:41.383
Are you seeing a
recollectionist?

08:41.418 --> 08:42.818
Look, I got it under control.

08:42.852 --> 08:45.020
Prolonged use of Membliss

08:45.055 --> 08:47.423
may result in paranoia,
visual distortions

08:47.457 --> 08:48.824
- Uh-huh.
- Short-term memory loss,

08:48.859 --> 08:50.826
- migraines, heart palpitations,
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

08:50.861 --> 08:52.795
- Increased risk of aneurysms,
- Mm-hmm.

08:52.829 --> 08:54.330
- Right.
- Blackouts and diarrhea.

08:54.364 --> 08:56.332
Diarrhea?
So it wasn't my burrito.

08:56.366 --> 08:57.800
Just wanted to make sure
you were listening.

08:57.834 --> 09:00.569
Look, I need those pills
to remember things.

09:00.604 --> 09:02.371
They open up memory clusters
so I can remember...

09:02.405 --> 09:04.473
- About the ambush.
- Right.

09:06.610 --> 09:09.578
I've got it under control.

09:20.790 --> 09:24.360
I could never have afforded
Mendel on my own.

09:24.394 --> 09:26.395
But Lila was special.

09:26.429 --> 09:28.030
And they let
in a couple of naturals

09:28.064 --> 09:29.365
every year on scholarship.

09:29.399 --> 09:30.766
So she wasn't a chrome?

09:30.800 --> 09:33.235
Lila wasn't
genetically modified?

09:33.270 --> 09:35.104
No, she was born gifted.

09:35.138 --> 09:36.639
She worked really, really hard.

09:36.673 --> 09:38.674
Straight A's all the way.
Is there anything

09:38.708 --> 09:40.376
you can remember
about your daughter's death?

09:40.410 --> 09:42.545
Anything that might've come
to you in retrospect?

09:42.579 --> 09:44.613
In your report, you said

09:44.648 --> 09:46.615
that Lila was a strong swimmer,

09:46.650 --> 09:47.950
that she never would've drowned.

09:47.984 --> 09:49.485
And that if she did have
drugs in her system,

09:49.519 --> 09:51.220
that she wouldn't have
done them alone.

09:51.254 --> 09:52.488
That's right.

09:52.522 --> 09:53.822
If those drugs helped kill Lila,

09:53.857 --> 09:55.357
somewhere knew
where she got them.

09:55.392 --> 09:58.627
But none of her friends
would say anything.

09:58.662 --> 10:00.696
So I hired a private detective

10:00.730 --> 10:02.431
to find out more about
what happened that night.

10:02.465 --> 10:04.266
But they denied
being her friends.

10:04.301 --> 10:05.968
He got recordings
of some conversations

10:06.002 --> 10:07.570
that proved
they knew each other.

10:07.604 --> 10:08.971
What was on them?

10:09.005 --> 10:10.906
Talking about being
with Lila that night.

10:10.941 --> 10:12.708
Like I thought.

10:12.742 --> 10:14.443
Did they say anything
about drugs?

10:14.477 --> 10:15.644
No.

10:15.679 --> 10:16.946
Which friends?

10:16.980 --> 10:19.648
Elinor Church
and Scarlett Davis.

10:23.019 --> 10:24.653
What is this about?

10:24.688 --> 10:27.223
We found those two girls
dead this morning.

10:27.257 --> 10:28.724
They had the same unknown drug

10:28.758 --> 10:30.059
in their system as Lila did.

10:30.093 --> 10:32.795
But a lot more of it.

10:39.936 --> 10:43.105
What did you do
with the recordings?

10:43.139 --> 10:46.342
(stammers)
I gave everything to the police.

10:46.376 --> 10:48.444
(beeping)

10:48.478 --> 10:50.012
There's no record of that.

10:51.414 --> 10:53.182
I know,
when I followed up on it,

10:53.216 --> 10:56.018
they said the recordings
were blank.

10:56.052 --> 10:57.620
What do you mean?

10:57.654 --> 10:59.221
You were told they were erased?

10:59.256 --> 11:01.190
That's what I was told.

11:01.224 --> 11:03.726
They blamed it on
a magnetic surge.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.961
They say that happens sometimes.

11:10.133 --> 11:11.867
Doesn't it?

11:11.901 --> 11:14.870
Well, it can,
but it's unlikely.

11:14.904 --> 11:17.139
Are you suggesting
someone made it disappear?

11:17.173 --> 11:19.074
Anything's possible.

11:19.109 --> 11:21.350
Do you have the contact details
of the private detective?

11:23.446 --> 11:25.314
Let me get my phone.

11:30.353 --> 11:32.655
Who was the cop that
originally investigated

11:32.689 --> 11:33.889
the case?

11:33.923 --> 11:35.991
Detective Geary, 23rd precinct.

11:36.026 --> 11:38.894
Okay, well, let's find out
what type of cop he was.

11:38.928 --> 11:41.297
Dirty? Clean?
Put on a request.

11:45.502 --> 11:47.803
(indistinct chatter)

12:03.453 --> 12:07.423
VALERIE: You and Lila were the
only naturals in your grade.

12:09.025 --> 12:11.293
I would think you would
hang out together.

12:11.328 --> 12:12.828
You'd think.

12:14.331 --> 12:15.631
You're one?

12:15.665 --> 12:17.199
You're a chrome?

12:20.870 --> 12:23.072
How did you know that?

12:25.008 --> 12:27.676
I can tell by now.

12:27.711 --> 12:29.791
I've never seen a chrome
as a police officer, though.

12:31.414 --> 12:34.016
I'm a detective.

12:34.050 --> 12:35.884
And stranger things
have happened.

12:35.919 --> 12:38.520
We want to know if the
drug that killed Lila,

12:38.555 --> 12:40.889
Elinor and Scarlett
is being sold here.

12:40.924 --> 12:42.591
It's very important
you let us in on

12:42.625 --> 12:44.526
what you know.

12:44.561 --> 12:46.261
Or maybe what you've heard.

12:46.296 --> 12:48.330
I don't know about drugs.

12:48.365 --> 12:50.566
I know Lila.

12:50.600 --> 12:51.867
Knew.

12:51.901 --> 12:54.236
I didn't know the
other girls very well.

12:54.270 --> 12:56.972
Lila had aspirations.

12:57.006 --> 12:59.441
To get along.

12:59.476 --> 13:00.743
I don't know,
this place is weird.

13:00.777 --> 13:01.710
Chromes can be...

13:01.745 --> 13:04.012
kind of weird, sometimes.

13:04.047 --> 13:06.148
No offense.

13:06.182 --> 13:08.050
Lila really wanted
to be up there

13:08.084 --> 13:09.284
competing with the chromes.

13:09.319 --> 13:10.819
And who wouldn't want to?

13:10.854 --> 13:13.455
I have the grades
to be here, but...

13:13.490 --> 13:16.425
I just, I don't
feel I belong here.

13:16.459 --> 13:17.926
(sighs)

13:17.961 --> 13:20.129
I'm just not sure I have
what it takes to stay.

13:23.266 --> 13:25.267
I-If it wasn't so
important to my parents,

13:25.301 --> 13:27.136
I-I'd transfer.

13:27.170 --> 13:28.937
You know what?

13:28.972 --> 13:30.939
I bet you fit in
better than you know.

13:33.810 --> 13:35.978
<i>You knew Scarlett and Elinor.</i>

13:36.012 --> 13:38.280
Did you have any
classes with them?

13:38.314 --> 13:40.549
Computer science. Advanced.

13:40.583 --> 13:41.683
We were wondering if...

13:41.718 --> 13:43.118
There are no illegal
drugs at Mendel.

13:43.153 --> 13:45.821
You didn't let her
finish the question.

13:45.855 --> 13:47.589
Was she gonna say
something else?

13:47.624 --> 13:48.824
VALERIE:
How can you be so sure

13:48.825 --> 13:50.265
there are no illegal
drugs at Mendel?

13:50.293 --> 13:52.828
Just am. Your friends are dead.

13:52.862 --> 13:54.630
Aren't you afraid

13:54.664 --> 13:56.784
that whatever happened to them
is gonna happen to you?

13:57.901 --> 13:59.435
I don't do illegal drugs.

13:59.469 --> 14:01.136
JOHN: Oh, that's smart...
"illegal" drugs.

14:01.171 --> 14:03.272
What about legal drugs?

14:03.306 --> 14:05.541
Or new drugs that haven't
been made illegal yet?

14:05.575 --> 14:07.142
You wouldn't understand.

14:17.654 --> 14:19.321
Come on, Marshall.

14:19.355 --> 14:20.989
Why don't you try
and explain it?

14:26.496 --> 14:28.697
I mean, what are you
trying to protect?

14:32.502 --> 14:35.871
(mouthing)

14:35.905 --> 14:37.206
VALERIE:
What did he say?

14:37.240 --> 14:40.542
He said we wouldn't understand.

14:50.317 --> 14:51.951
John, I found this

14:51.985 --> 14:53.819
in Scarlett's dorm room.

14:53.854 --> 14:56.021
- You have her DNA on file?
- DORIAN: I do.

14:56.056 --> 14:58.157
Open it.

14:59.526 --> 15:02.094
(beeps, swooshes)

15:03.363 --> 15:07.299
Whatever they took,
I think this is it.

15:11.805 --> 15:14.740
VALERIE: The tox lab said they've
never seen a drug quite like it.

15:14.775 --> 15:16.742
There were snippets
of Scarlett's DNA

15:16.777 --> 15:17.977
attached to the molecule.

15:18.011 --> 15:19.812
It was made
specifically for her.

15:19.846 --> 15:22.014
The ultimate designer drug.

15:22.048 --> 15:24.416
- What does it do?
- It's hard to say.

15:24.451 --> 15:25.751
There are some
hallucinogenic elements,

15:25.786 --> 15:26.986
but also things

15:27.020 --> 15:28.320
we just don't understand yet.

15:28.355 --> 15:29.722
It targets at least

15:29.756 --> 15:31.791
a dozen different
neurotransmitter groups.

15:31.825 --> 15:33.459
This is not
something the average

15:33.493 --> 15:35.828
metal meth head can
cook up in their basement.

15:35.862 --> 15:37.429
Definitely not.

15:37.464 --> 15:40.266
The chemical layers
are 1.5 microns thick

15:40.300 --> 15:41.667
and extremely uniform.

15:41.701 --> 15:42.935
Oh!

15:42.969 --> 15:44.770
I know what made this.

15:44.805 --> 15:46.338
This pill was printed.

15:46.373 --> 15:50.309
Rudy says that a pharmaceutical
grade ChemPrinter

15:50.343 --> 15:51.544
was used to make this pill.

15:51.578 --> 15:52.678
Based on the pill's structure,

15:52.712 --> 15:55.014
it had to be one
of three models.

15:55.048 --> 15:56.148
ChemPrinters are pricey

15:56.183 --> 15:57.716
and highly regulated...

15:57.751 --> 15:59.084
they require a license.

15:59.119 --> 16:01.086
Let's find the ones in the city.

16:01.121 --> 16:02.188
Let's go.

16:05.625 --> 16:08.027
John...

16:10.030 --> 16:12.965
A Chemulon-6 ChemPrinter was
licensed at a private residence

16:12.999 --> 16:14.500
in Grey Harbor,

16:14.534 --> 16:16.001
less than three miles
from Mendel Academy.

16:16.036 --> 16:19.438
The owner is Edgar Wollenberg.

16:19.472 --> 16:20.673
He's been dead

16:20.707 --> 16:22.007
for seven months.

16:22.042 --> 16:23.375
But his son Julian

16:23.410 --> 16:25.744
was expelled from
Mendel last year.

16:30.183 --> 16:33.018
The Chemulon-6 has a very
interesting safety feature:

16:33.053 --> 16:36.288
it automatically
backs up a history

16:36.323 --> 16:38.190
of every drug
it prints to a cloud.

16:38.225 --> 16:39.625
I've found the DNA
of all of our victims

16:39.659 --> 16:41.727
in the log... this is
definitely the machine

16:41.761 --> 16:43.841
(distant, echoing): that
supplied them with the drug.

16:45.265 --> 16:46.332
John.

16:46.366 --> 16:47.733
Are you listening to me?

16:47.767 --> 16:49.401
Did you just have
another flash?

16:49.436 --> 16:51.403
Maybe I should drive.

16:51.438 --> 16:53.739
I told you, I've got
it under control.

16:53.773 --> 16:54.707
Go on.

16:54.741 --> 16:56.375
Lila Hoving only took

16:56.409 --> 16:58.811
one dose, one time:
the night she died.

16:58.845 --> 17:01.413
Scarlett and Elinor had been
taking the drug a while.

17:01.448 --> 17:02.615
How long?

17:02.649 --> 17:03.916
Roughly a year.

17:03.950 --> 17:05.384
But their fatal doses

17:05.417 --> 17:06.785
were 1,000 times stronger

17:06.819 --> 17:08.220
than their previous ones.

17:08.255 --> 17:09.588
(distant, echoing):
It looks as if this dealer

17:09.623 --> 17:11.156
intentionally overdosed them.

17:16.363 --> 17:17.896
(horn blaring) John!

17:21.635 --> 17:22.935
Watch out!

17:26.339 --> 17:29.408
(panting)

17:31.378 --> 17:32.778
Yeah.

17:32.812 --> 17:34.246
You've got it totally
under control.

17:48.695 --> 17:50.095
(chimes)

17:59.306 --> 18:00.940
It doesn't look that bad.

18:00.974 --> 18:02.942
I'm sorry, could you
speak up, please?

18:08.348 --> 18:11.350
I bet that's
an interesting story.

18:11.384 --> 18:12.651
Detective Kennex.

18:12.686 --> 18:15.187
Julian.
Wollenberg.

18:16.556 --> 18:18.590
We have some questions
we'd like you to answer.

18:18.625 --> 18:20.859
We have permission
to search the house.

18:23.830 --> 18:25.965
(classical music playing)

18:28.601 --> 18:31.971
These are, uh...
police officers, Ma.

18:32.005 --> 18:34.974
They are here to ask
me some questions,

18:35.008 --> 18:37.710
but don't worry.

18:39.346 --> 18:40.746
They chromed me late.

18:40.780 --> 18:42.381
The machine's downstairs.

18:46.052 --> 18:49.188
My father got it
to make his own pills...

18:49.222 --> 18:52.057
his own, uh...
drug regimen.

18:52.092 --> 18:54.059
At the end,
his doctors were trying

18:54.094 --> 18:56.095
all sorts of different
treatment avenues.

18:56.129 --> 18:58.497
How long have you been dealing?

19:00.900 --> 19:04.703
We found the DNA profile
of the girls who died

19:04.738 --> 19:06.839
on the backup log
of your ChemPrinter...

19:06.873 --> 19:09.108
along with every customer

19:09.142 --> 19:10.809
you ever printed a pill for.

19:10.844 --> 19:14.013
Bet you didn't know
it had that feature.

19:14.047 --> 19:16.548
(whirring)

19:23.356 --> 19:24.390
So when did you...

19:24.424 --> 19:26.291
You don't believe me.

19:26.326 --> 19:28.227
Now you know

19:28.261 --> 19:29.728
why I didn't come forward.

19:29.763 --> 19:31.130
Come again?

19:31.164 --> 19:33.198
You don't believe me.

19:33.233 --> 19:35.200
Now you know why
I didn't come forward.

19:35.235 --> 19:37.903
JOHN: I didn't ask you why
you didn't come forward.

19:37.937 --> 19:39.304
JULIAN:
Not yet.

19:40.673 --> 19:42.908
This conversation
happened already.

19:42.942 --> 19:44.743
Can't you see them?

19:44.778 --> 19:45.978
Our words?

19:46.012 --> 19:48.080
They're all here.

19:48.114 --> 19:49.415
Your answers...

19:49.449 --> 19:51.183
are in the air.

19:51.217 --> 19:54.386
So there's no point in us
having this conversation, right?

19:56.556 --> 19:58.390
DORIAN:
You're on the drug right now.

20:09.636 --> 20:11.403
I am.

20:14.641 --> 20:16.775
Well, we're gonna have
this conversation anyway.

20:16.810 --> 20:18.043
(laughs)

20:18.078 --> 20:19.845
What does the drug do?

20:19.879 --> 20:21.080
It's called Vero.

20:21.114 --> 20:23.082
It expands the mind,

20:23.116 --> 20:26.018
it opens it up to
things that are here

20:26.052 --> 20:27.786
that we can't normally see.

20:27.821 --> 20:31.857
It enables you to realize
your full potential.

20:31.891 --> 20:35.227
The next Einstein,
or Macgregor.

20:35.261 --> 20:37.362
Scarlett and Elinor
were deliberately O.D.'d.

20:37.397 --> 20:38.664
Did you kill them?

20:38.698 --> 20:40.466
No.

20:40.500 --> 20:41.700
I didn't.

20:41.734 --> 20:43.635
If I was gonna

20:43.670 --> 20:45.037
kill someone...

20:45.071 --> 20:46.472
I wouldn't get caught.

20:46.506 --> 20:49.475
Certainly not with
the machine in my own house.

20:49.509 --> 20:52.311
Unless that's exactly what
you wanted us to think.

20:52.345 --> 20:55.247
Committing a crime
so carelessly

20:55.281 --> 20:57.483
that we'd assume it wasn't you.

20:57.517 --> 21:00.219
"How could some one
so smart be so dumb?"

21:00.253 --> 21:04.389
That'd be smart, I guess.

21:04.424 --> 21:06.091
And you knew the
machine had a backup,

21:06.126 --> 21:08.327
so it was pointless
getting rid of it.

21:08.361 --> 21:10.529
So many roads.

21:14.267 --> 21:17.069
JOHN:
Is that how she drowned?

21:19.672 --> 21:22.174
Did you kill her?

21:22.208 --> 21:24.710
Was it unintentional?

21:24.744 --> 21:26.578
You wouldn't understand.

21:26.613 --> 21:28.413
Yeah, I've heard
that a lot lately.

21:28.448 --> 21:30.449
Did the other girls find out?

21:30.483 --> 21:32.684
They were gonna rat, so you
O.D.'d them to shut them up?

21:32.719 --> 21:35.020
I'm trying to tell you...

21:35.054 --> 21:36.421
the Chemulon printer was hacked.

21:36.456 --> 21:38.724
Somebody messed with the doses.

21:38.758 --> 21:39.958
Hacked?

21:39.993 --> 21:42.127
- Mm-hmm.
- So you're telling us

21:42.162 --> 21:43.562
that you didn't
kill these girls

21:43.596 --> 21:45.264
even though your machine
made the drugs?

21:45.298 --> 21:46.532
That their deaths

21:46.566 --> 21:48.367
had nothing to do
with Lila Hoving?

21:48.401 --> 21:50.769
And you got hacked?

21:53.239 --> 21:55.541
I don't believe you.

21:56.709 --> 21:58.677
Now you understand...

22:00.880 --> 22:03.282
why I didn't come forward.

22:15.729 --> 22:18.230
There was a kid we interviewed
today at Mendel

22:18.265 --> 22:21.400
named Marsha, studies
advanced computer science.

22:21.435 --> 22:23.302
Same class as all three girls.

22:23.337 --> 22:26.339
So if there is a hacker,
you're thinking it'd be him.

22:26.373 --> 22:28.374
Let's look closer at him.

22:28.408 --> 22:30.209
Julian...

22:30.243 --> 22:32.178
You know a kid named Marshall?

22:33.613 --> 22:34.914
Everybody knows Marshall.

22:34.948 --> 22:35.948
Yeah?

22:35.982 --> 22:37.516
What do you know about him?

22:43.457 --> 22:45.291
(phone chimes)

22:49.129 --> 22:50.963
D, you drive.

22:52.966 --> 22:55.534
Can't be any worse
than me blacking out.

23:08.248 --> 23:09.949
You got something?

23:09.983 --> 23:12.685
Ugh, not that kid again.

23:12.719 --> 23:14.687
JOHN: Julian said his
ChemPrinter was hacked.

23:14.721 --> 23:18.457
Is it bad I want it
to be him no matter what?

23:18.492 --> 23:19.892
What about motive?

23:19.926 --> 23:21.894
- No, not yet.
- All right,

23:21.928 --> 23:24.864
put that on hold for a second.
I think I have something better.

23:24.898 --> 23:27.166
I've been looking for
communication between the kids

23:27.200 --> 23:28.634
around the time of Lila's death.

23:28.668 --> 23:30.803
Nothing really popped up,
but then I found this.

23:32.372 --> 23:35.074
It's an exchange between
Scarlett and her father.

23:35.108 --> 23:37.510
It's a couple of weeks
after Lila's death.

23:44.551 --> 23:48.187
That's the last transmission...
till she died.

23:48.221 --> 23:52.158
He reached out to her several times
after that, but she never responded.

23:52.192 --> 23:53.526
Yeah, they talked all the time,

23:53.560 --> 23:55.661
and then all of a sudden,
they didn't.

23:55.695 --> 23:57.596
It'd have to be
a very good reason

23:57.631 --> 24:00.099
for a daughter
to write off her father.

24:00.133 --> 24:03.569
So what'd he "take care of"
to get her so upset?

24:03.603 --> 24:07.306
Well, let's find him,
let's ask him.

24:25.859 --> 24:27.026
Hey.

24:27.060 --> 24:30.863
Hey. I took the liberty
of ordering.

24:30.897 --> 24:32.064
Oh, thanks.

24:32.098 --> 24:34.900
Cheers.
Mm-hmm.

24:42.342 --> 24:44.176
So, how you feeling?

24:47.747 --> 24:49.648
You sound like Dorian.

24:51.518 --> 24:52.918
Are you using
alternative therapies

24:52.953 --> 24:54.520
to help you remember things?

24:56.156 --> 24:58.591

a little unsteady to me.

24:58.625 --> 25:01.193
Unsteady?

25:02.229 --> 25:04.163
Tell me what's going on.

25:09.436 --> 25:11.303
I'm remembering some things.

25:11.338 --> 25:14.206
Things before the ambush.

25:14.241 --> 25:16.509
They said this would happen.

25:16.543 --> 25:19.545
You should let it
happen naturally.

25:19.579 --> 25:20.779
This is dangerous, John.

25:20.814 --> 25:23.048
What are you remembering?

25:23.083 --> 25:27.586
Things about Anna, but
nothing significant yet.

25:28.889 --> 25:31.790
You need to focus on
the successes you've just had.

25:31.825 --> 25:33.692
That's how you rebuild.

25:33.727 --> 25:37.329
You saved the precinct
the first week you were back.

25:37.364 --> 25:39.331
It doesn't make up
for who we lost.

25:39.366 --> 25:40.833
Those were my men, too.

25:40.867 --> 25:42.234
You're not the only one
who's responsible.

25:42.269 --> 25:44.003
I let her in.

25:44.037 --> 25:46.572
She has answers.
Now that this is all

25:46.606 --> 25:49.375
coming back to me,
I'm consumed by it.

25:49.409 --> 25:51.610
Look, John, I know you are.

25:51.645 --> 25:55.781
And I care enough about you
to tell you the truth.

25:55.815 --> 25:57.483
If you obsess about revenge,

25:57.517 --> 25:59.552
it'll take you down.

26:01.521 --> 26:03.556
Now that you
are remembering things,

26:03.590 --> 26:06.592
we're gonna have to talk
to Internal Affairs again.

26:43.163 --> 26:45.331
I wasn't expecting you
until tomorrow.

26:45.365 --> 26:46.999
You've been here
five days straight.

26:47.033 --> 26:48.634
Give your mind a rest.

26:48.668 --> 26:51.437
You're a recollectionist,
so let's recollect.

26:51.471 --> 26:54.206
I want to get in the chair...
tonight.

27:02.449 --> 27:03.315
(sighs)

27:03.350 --> 27:05.551
(staccato vibrating)

27:11.430 --> 27:14.131
ANNA:
<i>I've got something for you.</i>

27:14.166 --> 27:16.367
<i>I hope you like it.</i>
<i>It's kind of silly.</i>

27:16.401 --> 27:18.836
(echoing):
<i>I got something...</i>

27:21.139 --> 27:23.174
<i>I got something for you.</i>

27:23.208 --> 27:25.409
<i>It's just something small.</i>

27:25.444 --> 27:27.678
(echoing):
<i>I just saw it...</i>

27:36.421 --> 27:40.124
So, what did you see?

28:38.416 --> 28:39.984
- McGinnis.
- No.

28:40.018 --> 28:43.053
I need you to check something out.
It's got to do with...

28:43.088 --> 28:44.855
BOTH:
...the Insyndicate ambush.

28:44.890 --> 28:47.491
Yeah. I need you to run these
for DNA, tech, fingerprints.

28:47.526 --> 28:49.860
Anything we can trace
back to a suspect.

28:49.895 --> 28:51.729
And you want it off the books
like the others?

28:51.763 --> 28:53.664
- It's important. - I'm
sure it is, Detective,

28:53.698 --> 28:57.034
and I want to help you. I've
<i>been</i> helping you, but I would

28:57.068 --> 28:58.469
also like to keep my job.

28:58.503 --> 28:59.837
And I can't keep
logging overtime

28:59.871 --> 29:01.238
on an unspecified case.

29:01.273 --> 29:03.407
Look, I'll sign off
on it myself.

29:03.441 --> 29:07.678
If I get any heat for this,
I'm saying you threatened me.

29:07.712 --> 29:09.613
You're in luck.
They'll believe that.

29:09.648 --> 29:12.316
- You're the best.
- Yeah, tell a friend.

29:28.366 --> 29:30.901
Do I need an attorney?

29:30.936 --> 29:33.137
JOHN:
That's your prerogative.

29:33.171 --> 29:34.805
Just a moment, please.

29:37.275 --> 29:40.344
MAN: Hey, Avery, I'm
just in a meeting.

29:40.378 --> 29:41.812
You've got to be here.

29:41.847 --> 29:44.014
I'm with the police.

29:47.819 --> 29:49.854
Christopher Corella.
I represent Mr. Davis.

29:49.888 --> 29:51.655
May I see your credentials?

29:54.993 --> 29:57.761
Thank you.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.196
What's this about?

29:59.231 --> 30:00.698
It's about Scarlett's overdose.

30:00.732 --> 30:02.800
We're just gonna ask
a few questions.

30:02.834 --> 30:04.468
You sent a message
to your daughter,

30:04.502 --> 30:05.870
saying you "took care of it."

30:05.904 --> 30:07.771
What did you take
care of, Mr. Davis?

30:07.806 --> 30:09.373
Don't answer that.

30:09.407 --> 30:10.875
Did you kill Lila Hoving?

30:10.909 --> 30:11.976
What?

30:14.779 --> 30:16.814
No. I would remind
you, Detective,

30:16.848 --> 30:17.948
my client is grieving.

30:17.983 --> 30:19.183
This is grounds for harassment.

30:19.184 --> 30:20.851
It is not harassment.
We're questioning

30:20.886 --> 30:23.087
your client in relation
to a triple homicide.

30:23.121 --> 30:27.124
Homi...?
What do you mean, homicide?

30:27.158 --> 30:30.094
Scarlett didn't die from an
accidental overdose, Mr. Davis.

30:30.128 --> 30:32.997
We have evidence that someone
deliberately spiked

30:33.031 --> 30:35.499
the doses meant for
Scarlett and Elinor.

30:35.533 --> 30:37.468
Are you sure?

30:37.502 --> 30:39.637
Positive.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.272
You had a problem
with your daughter.

30:41.306 --> 30:43.140
You weren't talking
at the time she died.

30:43.174 --> 30:44.308
Something you did upset her.

30:44.342 --> 30:45.776
What did you do,
Mr. Davis?

30:45.810 --> 30:48.545
Avery, I suggest that we discuss
this in private,

30:48.580 --> 30:51.548
and when we're ready, we'll
get back to the detectives.

31:00.892 --> 31:05.095
Scarlett was with Lila
that night, yes.

31:05.130 --> 31:07.331
Elinor, too.
They took the drugs together.

31:07.365 --> 31:11.135
But when the girls went back to
the school, Lila stayed behind.

31:11.169 --> 31:13.037
Why not just say that?

31:13.071 --> 31:16.840
Scarlett wanted to,
but I wouldn't let her.

31:16.875 --> 31:20.110
There was nothing anyone could
do to bring that girl back.

31:20.145 --> 31:22.112
I did not want my daughter's
life ruined.

31:22.147 --> 31:23.814
What happened wasn't her fault.

31:23.848 --> 31:26.717
Why should it follow her around?

31:26.751 --> 31:28.919
JOHN: The recordings
of the girls talking?

31:28.954 --> 31:30.988
Do you have anything
to do with that?

31:31.022 --> 31:35.392
I heard Mrs. Hoving hired
a private investigator.

31:35.427 --> 31:39.897
I paid money to make him
and the evidence disappear.

31:39.931 --> 31:42.599
So, you "took care of it."

31:42.634 --> 31:46.470
I was trying to protect her.

31:46.504 --> 31:49.306
But she didn't want
your protection, did she?

31:52.010 --> 31:54.244
She was always very honest.

31:56.815 --> 31:59.450
You know, she said
I'd pay for it.

31:59.484 --> 32:01.051
That we all would.

32:01.086 --> 32:03.754
And now we have.

32:03.788 --> 32:06.023
All of us.

32:06.057 --> 32:07.958
Your daughter?

32:07.993 --> 32:11.662
No, Mrs. Hoving.

32:19.204 --> 32:21.672
It's incriminating that
Mrs. Hoving never told us

32:21.706 --> 32:23.240
she contacted
any of the parents.

32:23.274 --> 32:25.394
Yeah, and when she told us
the recordings were erased,

32:25.410 --> 32:27.411
she acted like she had
no idea who did it.

32:27.445 --> 32:29.580
(phone rings) Kennex.

32:29.614 --> 32:31.482
PAUL: I got something
from Julian's bedroom.

32:31.516 --> 32:33.117
Found another one of those vials

32:33.151 --> 32:34.785
hidden behind a picture of Lila.

32:34.819 --> 32:36.420
This one opened
with Julian's DNA.

32:36.454 --> 32:37.688
Yeah? What was in it?

32:37.722 --> 32:39.923
Well, it's more than a pill.

32:42.460 --> 32:44.695
This image stick is encrypted.

32:44.729 --> 32:46.764
You want to tell us
what's on it?

32:46.798 --> 32:49.466
Not really.

32:49.501 --> 32:51.835
Here's a theory.

32:51.870 --> 32:55.639
Ms. Hoving discovered that you
were selling drugs to everybody,

32:55.673 --> 32:56.974
including her daughter.

32:57.008 --> 32:58.642
So she threatened
to tell the cops

32:58.676 --> 33:01.412
unless you were willing
to do what she wanted.

33:01.446 --> 33:04.481

good, must be important to you.

33:09.821 --> 33:12.389
Is it an insurance policy?

33:12.424 --> 33:14.525
Did you record her
threatening you?

33:14.559 --> 33:17.428
JOHN: You're a minor.

33:17.462 --> 33:19.163
We can cut you a deal,
call it coercion.

What's on the stick, Julian?

33:24.302 --> 33:28.205
It's the last thing
that Lila ever said to me.

33:34.787 --> 33:36.182
She was special.

33:38.065 --> 33:39.423
Such a good person.

33:44.327 --> 33:47.729
She was under so much pressure.

33:47.764 --> 33:49.565
What kind of pressure?

33:49.599 --> 33:50.799
All her mother's

40:20.223 --> 40:22.390
Did you check her out?

40:22.425 --> 40:24.125
New girl coming out of nowhere?

40:24.160 --> 40:25.861
What cop wouldn't, right?

40:25.895 --> 40:27.028
Of course I checked her out.

40:27.063 --> 40:28.023
I did a full background.

40:28.030 --> 40:30.131
- She was clean.
- Mm-hmm.

40:30.166 --> 40:33.835
You and Anna were moving
along pretty quickly, huh?

40:33.870 --> 40:35.904
So?

40:37.073 --> 40:39.841
Would you consider
yourself a romantic?

40:39.876 --> 40:42.344
What are you saying?

40:42.378 --> 40:45.113
Just through events and faith

40:45.147 --> 40:47.215
that maybe someday
you might meet the person

40:47.250 --> 40:49.184
that you're supposed to be with.

40:49.218 --> 40:52.854
Because if that's the way
you look at things,

40:52.889 --> 40:54.956
then maybe that type of thinking
might've prevented you

40:54.991 --> 40:56.992
from seeing something
you might not have seen

40:57.026 --> 40:59.928
if you didn't want it
to happen so badly.

40:59.962 --> 41:03.665
She infiltrated you.

41:03.699 --> 41:07.235
Gave Insyndicate
precinct files.

41:07.270 --> 41:10.372
And there were consequences.

41:10.406 --> 41:11.706
Look, I did everything
by the book.

41:11.741 --> 41:13.141
I don't know
how she got my files.

41:13.175 --> 41:14.142
I know, of course you did.

41:14.176 --> 41:15.076
I mean, it says right here.

41:15.111 --> 41:16.077
You wrote it down.

41:16.112 --> 41:17.579
You were in a coma, huh?

41:17.613 --> 41:20.081
You have trouble
remembering things.

41:20.116 --> 41:21.683
Isn't it possible that

41:21.717 --> 41:23.151
maybe you forgot
to follow protocol

41:23.185 --> 41:24.686
and now you just can't remember?

41:24.720 --> 41:27.289
You mean,
conveniently can't remember.

41:28.658 --> 41:31.126
I don't know.

41:34.130 --> 41:36.264
Look at your file though.

41:41.137 --> 41:45.607
You sure you don't
remember anything else?

41:47.610 --> 41:50.478
We're done.

42:20.276 --> 42:22.944
♪

42:46.535 --> 42:49.471
(phone rings)

42:52.708 --> 42:55.543
Hey, Detective,
we found something.

42:55.545 --> 42:57.012
What do you got?

42:57.046 --> 42:59.447
The department did
a high-level sweep of your place

42:59.482 --> 43:02.083
before you were reinstated,
but we missed this.

43:02.118 --> 43:05.086
The doll is a listening device.

43:05.121 --> 43:07.222
Within the pigment
of the doll is nano-circuitry.

43:07.256 --> 43:08.690
It's a radio transmitter.

43:08.724 --> 43:12.127
Someone's been listening to you.

43:12.161 --> 43:14.266
The last upload was
seven hours ago.
