00:09.593 --> 00:11.593
Way too excited
to stay in bed.

What kind of weirdo skips
a chance for more sleep?

I finish wrapping this gift.

the stupidest thing you've ever done.

I take it back,
threatening my aunt

you've ever done.

02:08.562 --> 02:12.231
I am not here to fight.
I am here to make a deal.

02:12.266 --> 02:13.532
A simple one.

02:13.567 --> 02:17.703
You will agree to never put on
the Spider-Man mask again.

You threaten me

Why am I going
to take you seriously now?

My Octobots with cameras
are everywhere.

02:36.590 --> 02:39.391
I've been keeping watch
over your aunt.

02:39.426 --> 02:43.328
I have only to say
the word, and good-bye.

02:44.398 --> 02:46.498
Why now?

02:46.534 --> 02:51.136
I had to wait until all the cards

the right decision, Parker.

I don't think breakfast
will be my problem today.

Ock's threatened Spider-Man

03:08.055 --> 03:10.155
dozens of times,
but this is different.

03:10.191 --> 03:12.124
This is a threat
to Peter Parker,

has vulnerabilities.

Aw, shucks.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.034
All in a day's work for the
friendly, neighborhood me.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.035
(GRUNTS)

11:11.939 --> 11:13.738
Cloak.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.073
We've bagged a Scorpion,
a Lizard,

11:15.108 --> 11:18.076
a Vulture, and a...
Whatever Kraven is.

11:18.111 --> 11:22.113
The only thing we're missing in
Ock's twisted zoo is a Rhino!

11:22.149 --> 11:24.015
Has anyone seen Rhino?

11:24.051 --> 11:25.750
(GRUNTS)
Seeing him

11:25.786 --> 11:27.185
up close and personal.

11:27.220 --> 11:30.088
<i>The boathouse, if you're up
for a trip to Central Park.</i>

11:32.859 --> 11:35.193
It's a beautiful day,
why not?

11:35.228 --> 11:38.129
(GRUNTING)

11:45.172 --> 11:46.871
"What did you
do today, Miles?"

11:46.907 --> 11:49.074
Oh, I ran into
an old friend in the park.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.942
Actually, he ran into me!

11:50.978 --> 11:52.844
Really?
Bad jokes?

11:52.879 --> 11:55.013
You've been hanging out
with Spider-Man too long.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.816
Rhino doesn't know the
meaning of the word friend,

11:57.851 --> 11:59.050
but here's a hint.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.720
It doesn't mean stabbing
your team in the back!

12:01.755 --> 12:03.188
(GRUNTING)

12:09.930 --> 12:12.964
Friends. Enemies.
Ock commands!

12:13.000 --> 12:13.999
(YELLS)

12:15.869 --> 12:17.002
Cut Rhino some slack.

12:17.037 --> 12:19.170
Ock's messed with his mind
over and over again.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.972
And take it from me,

12:21.008 --> 12:23.108
Ock's brainwashing
ain't easy to get over.

12:23.143 --> 12:26.211
I vote for determining Rhino's
motives after we contain him.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.116
(GRUNTS)

12:35.822 --> 12:38.823
Miles, MJ,
lead him to the water!

12:38.859 --> 12:41.551
Oh, so now I want him
to follow me?

12:41.839 --> 12:45.244
So what's your plan, Spidey?
Hope rhinos hate getting wet?

12:46.199 --> 12:47.232
(YELLS)

12:53.974 --> 12:55.840
Pour on the freeze webs, now!

12:55.876 --> 12:57.175
Clever move, Tiger.

13:01.882 --> 13:04.450
Rhino, I know our friend
is still in there.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.318
I need him to come out.
I need to know where Ock is.

13:07.354 --> 13:10.054
Ock is close.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.023
Close as in New York?

13:12.392 --> 13:15.026
Much closer.

13:19.633 --> 13:20.818
(GRUNTS)

13:21.835 --> 13:24.836
I see you put the mask
on, Spider-Man.

13:24.871 --> 13:26.971
Now time for
the consequences!

13:27.007 --> 13:28.807
Got that right.

13:32.679 --> 13:36.281
Doctor Octopus was
hiding underwater.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.855
Should have seen
that coming.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.722
DR. OCTOPUS: I warned you, Spider-Man!

13:43.490 --> 13:44.623
(GRUNTING)

13:46.560 --> 13:48.727
You pathetic child.

13:48.762 --> 13:52.697
I gave you an ultimatum which
you foolishly chose to ignore.

13:52.733 --> 13:56.501
Becoming Spider-Man again
will be your final mistake!

13:56.537 --> 13:58.603
You're the one
who made a mistake, Ock.

13:58.639 --> 14:00.305
You can eat
my wheat cakes,

14:00.340 --> 14:02.340
but no one threatens
my Aunt May!

14:02.376 --> 14:05.277
Web Warriors,
Water Defense Alpha, now!

14:06.513 --> 14:08.262
What foolishness is...

14:08.263 --> 14:10.372
(YELLS)

14:15.322 --> 14:16.588
Great work, everyone.

14:16.623 --> 14:20.225
Wrapped this up just in time
to get our graduation on.

14:20.260 --> 14:21.493
You did it, Spidey.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.495
You stopped
your greatest enemy.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.463
It's finally over.

14:25.499 --> 14:27.432
May is safe
because of you.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.267
That's gotta
feel good, Tiger.

14:29.303 --> 14:31.570
No. She's safe
because of us.

14:31.605 --> 14:33.471
I know each of you
joined this team

14:33.507 --> 14:35.507
because circumstances
forced you to.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.442
But the way we've come
to work together,

14:37.477 --> 14:39.377
I'm proud of you all.

14:39.413 --> 14:41.646
IRON SPIDER: The nerd,
the jock, the cool girl,

14:41.682 --> 14:44.482
the tough guy, and the kid
from another dimension.

14:44.518 --> 14:46.484
This unlikely arrangement
would never have formed

14:46.520 --> 14:48.486
if it weren't for you,
Spider-Man.

14:48.522 --> 14:51.289
You guys were always
gonna be heroes.

14:51.325 --> 14:52.757
I'm just glad I got
to see it happen.

14:52.793 --> 14:55.577
SCARLET SPIDER: All right. All right.
Enough with the emotions already.

14:55.612 --> 14:59.347
Scarlet's right. Let's get this
loser back to a holding cell

14:59.383 --> 15:01.876
before we're late
for our own graduation!

15:03.654 --> 15:05.553
SPIDER-MAN: Take them
to the security floor.

15:05.589 --> 15:07.622
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s got some
nice accommodations ready.

15:07.658 --> 15:09.324
POWER MAN: Spidey!

15:09.359 --> 15:11.259
Just in time, webhead.

15:11.295 --> 15:13.461
Everyone's already arriving
for the graduation.

15:13.497 --> 15:14.529
Everyone?

15:16.633 --> 15:20.468
Whoa. I think we're
gonna need more chairs.

15:20.504 --> 15:23.672
Fury's back? Dr. Strange?
The Avengers?

15:23.707 --> 15:25.573
Well, what did
you expect?

15:25.609 --> 15:28.410
You've helped a lot
of people, Spider-Man.

15:28.445 --> 15:31.413
They just want to say
thank you. We all do.

15:31.448 --> 15:34.482
Without you, I'd still
be a criminal.

15:34.518 --> 15:37.344
Or worse, under Ock's control.

15:37.345 --> 15:40.027
Freeing you, Sandman, is
what anyone would have done.

15:40.028 --> 15:42.490
Nah-uh.
Not anyone, Spidey.

15:42.526 --> 15:44.292
You.

15:44.328 --> 15:46.972
Now go, enjoy your guests.

15:49.566 --> 15:52.942
Mom? Dad?
I'm so happy you came!

15:54.138 --> 15:56.138
Tony Stark?
I might faint.

15:56.373 --> 15:57.862
I'm your biggest fan.

15:57.863 --> 16:00.975
I saw the specs on the Mark 16 armor.
Genius!

16:01.011 --> 16:03.878
You definitely have
good taste, Mr. Cho.

16:03.913 --> 16:06.748
I've seen some
of your designs, too.

16:06.783 --> 16:10.985
Any interest in a position at Stark
Enterprises' Advanced Design Department?

16:11.021 --> 16:13.788
(SIGHS) Definitely
going to faint.

16:13.823 --> 16:16.658
An internship at Stark
is my dream!

16:16.693 --> 16:18.960
"Internship"?
Nice one, kid.

16:18.995 --> 16:20.762
I need you to run it.

16:20.797 --> 16:22.697
Yes.

16:22.732 --> 16:24.766
The ceremony's
gonna start soon.

16:24.801 --> 16:26.706
Shouldn't a certain
aunt be here?

16:26.707 --> 16:29.471
Ant-Man's over there. He can
be hard to spot sometimes.

16:29.506 --> 16:31.439
Different kind
of aunt, genius.

16:32.342 --> 16:33.641
May! Oh!

16:35.462 --> 16:37.329
Does this mean
you've caught him?

16:37.625 --> 16:39.364
Yep. Ock and
all his friends,

16:39.399 --> 16:41.428
the Securely-locked-up Six.

16:45.338 --> 16:48.273
Shame you didn't listen
to me, Spider-Man.

16:48.308 --> 16:51.055
Your aunt could have
been protected.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.245
Don't let him
bother you.

16:54.281 --> 16:56.347
Excuse me.
I've got this.

16:56.383 --> 16:57.515
Knock it off, Ock.

16:57.551 --> 16:59.517
When I first met you,
you scared me.

16:59.553 --> 17:01.486
But I've come a long way
since then.

17:01.521 --> 17:04.255
Instead of hiding,
I hunted you down.

17:04.290 --> 17:05.457
You didn't count
on that, did you?

17:05.492 --> 17:09.194
Oh, that's exactly
what I counted on.

17:09.229 --> 17:12.464
You didn't think my armor was
insulated from electric shock?

17:18.472 --> 17:19.471
May!

17:22.409 --> 17:27.444
Thank you for assembling my superior
Sinister Six for me, Spider-Man.

17:27.481 --> 17:33.418
This was entirely a set-up to bring us
all together inside the Triskelion.

17:33.453 --> 17:36.721
You and your little friends
played your parts perfectly.

17:36.756 --> 17:37.822
(GRUNTING)

17:37.857 --> 17:39.524
Leave her alone!

17:39.559 --> 17:41.592
I've done my research.

17:41.628 --> 17:44.529
I know all about
your Uncle Ben.

17:44.564 --> 17:47.632
May Parker is the only
family you have left,

17:47.667 --> 17:51.602
and I am going to make you
an orphan once and for all.

17:51.638 --> 17:54.405
I warned your nephew
of the consequences.

17:54.441 --> 17:55.955
This is on his head.

17:55.956 --> 17:57.542
- (GASPS)
- Do not worry.

17:57.577 --> 18:00.445
It will hurt him far more
than it hurts you.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.813
Stop! Please!

18:01.848 --> 18:04.549
You had your chance, Parker.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.551
I'll do anything!

18:06.586 --> 18:08.753
(GRUNTS)

18:09.556 --> 18:10.855
Anything?

18:11.758 --> 18:13.691
Hmm...

18:13.727 --> 18:17.628
Aren't you a big believer
in second chances?

18:17.664 --> 18:19.731
Then perhaps
I can give you one.

18:19.766 --> 18:24.502
I spent so much time trying
to replicate your powers,

18:24.537 --> 18:26.604
yet only recently
it occurred to me

18:26.639 --> 18:29.841
that I might be able
to do just the opposite.

18:29.876 --> 18:32.543
Inject yourself
with this serum,

18:32.579 --> 18:34.712
and your powers
will be gone.

18:34.748 --> 18:37.515
You'll go from being
the Ultimate Spider-Man

18:37.550 --> 18:40.418
to regular old
Peter Parker.

18:40.453 --> 18:43.688
Your days playing teenage
hero will be over,

18:43.723 --> 18:46.758
but you will
have saved your aunt.

18:46.793 --> 18:50.728
I'd advise against making
another poor decision.

18:50.764 --> 18:53.598
I've done a lot of good
as Spider-Man.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.433
But I've also made life
more dangerous

18:55.468 --> 18:57.735
<i>for my Aunt May and
everyone else close to me.</i>

18:57.771 --> 19:00.838
<i>How many people have I hurt
by being Spider-Man?</i>

19:00.874 --> 19:04.575
Now Ock and his Sinister Six are
reborn because I let them dupe me,

19:04.611 --> 19:07.512
bringing the bad guys right
to Aunt May and the team.

19:07.547 --> 19:08.746
Oh, this is all my fault.

19:11.418 --> 19:12.850
Don't worry about me, Peter.

19:12.886 --> 19:15.820
The world needs Spider-Man.
Don't do it.

19:15.855 --> 19:18.456
But I do worry about you,
Aunt May.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.458
I've already lost
Uncle Ben.

19:20.493 --> 19:23.694
He said, "With great power
comes great responsibility,"

19:23.730 --> 19:25.797
and here, now,

19:25.832 --> 19:28.733
the responsible thing to do

19:28.768 --> 19:30.668
is to stop
being Spider-Man.

19:36.543 --> 19:38.409
(GROANS)

19:39.879 --> 19:41.646
My powers. I...

19:41.681 --> 19:42.734
I think...

19:42.734 --> 19:43.681
(SIGHS)

19:43.716 --> 19:45.450
I think they're gone.

19:45.819 --> 19:47.618
(GRUNTS)

19:48.621 --> 19:51.522
Yes. It appears they are.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.807
No Spider sense.

19:53.807 --> 19:55.593
(LAUGHS)

19:55.628 --> 19:57.829
(GRUNTING)

19:57.864 --> 20:00.431
Nor Spider strength.

20:00.467 --> 20:02.733
And I will take care
of these.

20:02.769 --> 20:06.838
Spider-Man no more!

20:06.873 --> 20:08.806
(GASPING)

20:11.945 --> 20:14.812
You know I am
a man of my word.

20:16.616 --> 20:17.849
Peter!

20:20.553 --> 20:22.787
The... The joke's
on you, Ock.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.722
You may have de-powered me,

20:24.757 --> 20:28.626
but the greatest assembly of heroes
ever known is right outside.

20:28.661 --> 20:31.002
You picked the wrong day
to do this.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.265
(GRUNTS)

20:34.301 --> 20:38.303
On the contrary. You couldn't
have made this easier for me.

20:38.738 --> 20:42.807
Thank you for gathering all
of my enemies in one place.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.782
(CROWD CHATTERING)

20:59.959 --> 21:01.859
A hard-light shell.

21:01.895 --> 21:04.662
Those plans we found back
in the lab.

21:04.697 --> 21:09.634
Exactly. And yet, you still
never guessed my true plan.

21:09.669 --> 21:13.604
Not only have I invented a completely
impenetrable energy shell,

21:13.640 --> 21:17.289
but that shell
is contracting.

21:17.289 --> 21:21.612
Just like you, the heroes
will finally be crushed.

21:22.325 --> 21:25.571
DR. OCTOPUS: This
is all thanks to you, Parker,

21:25.585 --> 21:30.443
and you are literally
powerless to stop it.
