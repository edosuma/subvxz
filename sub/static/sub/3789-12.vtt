01:22.816 --> 01:24.306
What's up?

01:24.350 --> 01:27.808
It is 9:30! Do you know
where your only client is?

01:27.854 --> 01:30.914
Testing out the new emergency
asshole system, Ari?

01:30.957 --> 01:32.925
Vince missed his physical
this morning.

01:32.959 --> 01:34.927
No physical,
no insurance.

01:34.961 --> 01:36.724
No insurance,
no movie.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.822
Yeah, I know all about it.
I'm handling it.

01:38.865 --> 01:40.799
- When?
- As soon as he resurfaces.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.734
Nice "Aquaman" lingo.
At least one of you

01:42.769 --> 01:44.464
is committed to this
fucking movie.

01:44.504 --> 01:47.598
- Bye, Ari.
- Hey, take this seriously, E.

01:49.809 --> 01:51.299
Got MlLF?

01:51.344 --> 01:53.938
- Thank you.
- Superhero or no superhero,

01:53.980 --> 01:55.914
it's downright rude
to be this tardy.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.144
- Maybe we should get him a driver.
- He's got a driver.

01:58.184 --> 02:00.675
It's not my fault. I'm on call,
but I need to be called.

02:00.720 --> 02:02.187
Besides,
he coulda took a cab.

02:02.222 --> 02:03.689
Nobody takes cabs
in L.A., Turtle.

02:03.723 --> 02:05.714
'Cause no one can figure out
what color they are.

02:05.758 --> 02:07.953
They got blue ones, green ones,
red ones, white ones.

02:07.994 --> 02:10.519
Fuck a city where the cabs aren't
monochromatic yellow.

02:10.562 --> 02:13.031
- Uh-huh.
- Here he is.

02:13.066 --> 02:14.693
Oh, hey, Aquaman.

02:14.734 --> 02:17.532
- Mandy finally let you out of her web?
- Sorry I'm late.

02:17.570 --> 02:20.198
You know how hard it is
to break away from a good spooning.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.901
- What are we eating?
- We already ate.

02:21.941 --> 02:24.535
Just for the record,
I took the liberty of ordering you

02:24.577 --> 02:26.977
- this beautiful egg white frittata.
- Where is it?

02:27.013 --> 02:28.913
E had 'em clear it.

02:28.948 --> 02:31.610
In all fairness, the cheese
was starting to congeal.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.710
That's what happens
when you leave your breakfast

02:33.753 --> 02:35.345
- sitting on the table for 45 minutes.
- I get it.

02:35.388 --> 02:37.652
I shouldn't have kept
you guys waiting. I'm sorry.

02:37.690 --> 02:39.282
No, you don't get it.
You fucked up.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.725
- You missed your physical.
- Oh, fuck.

02:41.761 --> 02:44.821
I totally forgot.
We overslept.

02:44.864 --> 02:47.560
You're gonna have 4:00 A.M. call times.
Those gonna be a problem?

02:47.600 --> 02:50.194
- No, no problem.
- Scout's honor.

02:50.236 --> 02:53.433
- So, what else?
- You got weapons instruction at 2:00.

02:53.473 --> 02:55.498
You're gonna learn how
to use Aquaman's claw.

02:55.542 --> 02:56.941
Sweet!

02:58.845 --> 03:01.973
- What?
- Maybe now's not a good time to ask,

03:02.015 --> 03:04.950
but I kind of told Mandy
I'd go house-hunting with her.

03:04.984 --> 03:07.282
Anyway, we can
push it back, right?

03:07.320 --> 03:09.811
- Just an hour.
- Come on, don't be irresponsible.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.619
Irresponsible?

03:11.658 --> 03:13.649
You know, maybe we should
pick up the Maserati

03:13.693 --> 03:16.161
before we all start
saying things we regret.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.187
- Where's the Maserati?
- Police impound.

03:18.231 --> 03:20.563
Got stolen right in front
of Nacional last night.

03:20.600 --> 03:24.229
Guy loses a $100,000 car,
which I gave him,

03:24.270 --> 03:26.738
and he's calling me
irresponsible.

03:29.175 --> 03:30.972
Barbara Miller's
on the phone for you.

03:31.010 --> 03:33.570
- She's Mandy Moore's agent.
- I know who the fuck she is.

03:33.613 --> 03:36.673
Go get me a kava berry shake
with a pinch of bee pollen,

03:36.716 --> 03:39.116
all right, Lloyd?
What do you got, Babs?

03:39.152 --> 03:41.211
I got a giant fucking migraine
is what I got.

03:41.254 --> 03:43.745
I'll give you one
of my famous shoulder massages.

03:43.790 --> 03:46.054
- You remember those from the old days?
- I do, Ari.

03:46.092 --> 03:48.560
I also remember you threatened
to sue me for sexual harassment

03:48.595 --> 03:50.119
right before I fired you.

03:50.163 --> 03:52.825
- Didn't we settle out of court?
- Enough flirting, Ari.

03:52.865 --> 03:55.766
- I want you to listen the fuck up.
- What's the problem?

03:55.802 --> 03:57.770
The problem is your client
Vincent Chase

03:57.804 --> 04:00.272
is about to destroy
10 years of my hard work.

04:00.306 --> 04:03.400
I need some face-to-face
before this gets ugly.

04:03.443 --> 04:06.537
- I'll wear something clingy.
- You do that.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.706
I'm telling you, once
your car's been stolen,

04:08.748 --> 04:10.409
it never runs
the same again.

04:10.450 --> 04:12.315
It's like a guy sleeping
with your girl.

04:12.352 --> 04:13.819
He leaves his mark
all over her.

04:13.853 --> 04:15.821
And how does a car
know it's been stolen?

04:15.855 --> 04:17.982
Ask the Buddhists, bro.

04:18.024 --> 04:21.322
They believe everything's got a soul,
even a toaster oven.

04:21.361 --> 04:25.161
- Say, Shauna, what's up?
- Break out your composition notebook,

04:25.198 --> 04:29.294
and I want you to write 1,000 times
"l promise to control my client."

04:29.335 --> 04:31.428
- What now?
- This week's "Us Weekly"--

04:31.471 --> 04:33.735
three-page spread
of Vince and Mandy,

04:33.773 --> 04:36.970
including pictures of them
massaging produce at Bristol Farms.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.877
I told you Vince wasn't gonna
let the press control his life.

04:39.912 --> 04:42.039
- Pictures were inevitable.
- Fuck you, Eric.

04:42.081 --> 04:43.776
These look like
they're posing for them.

04:43.816 --> 04:45.943
Didn't I say fucking
soy milk, Christy? Come on!

04:45.985 --> 04:47.714
Soy milk's got more fat
than regular milk--

04:47.754 --> 04:49.278
Don't be a wise-ass.

04:49.322 --> 04:51.347
It's the other line, Shauna,
Be well. Hey.

04:51.391 --> 04:53.951
- Hey, idiot.
- Hey, what's up, asshole?

04:53.993 --> 04:55.927
Listen, I know about
the "Us Weekly" pictures.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.862
- I'm not worried.
- What does worry you, Eric?

04:57.897 --> 04:59.762
You're just so fucking
calm, so poised,

04:59.799 --> 05:02.233
- it makes me want to smack you.
- Go for it. I gotta go.

05:02.268 --> 05:04.133
I'm not calling about
"Us Weekly" pictures.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.138
- Be here in 30 minutes.
- Why? What's up?

05:06.172 --> 05:09.039
We're going to hell,
so bring your sunblock.

05:10.376 --> 05:12.105
Sir, how long is
this gonna take?

05:12.145 --> 05:14.477
Five minutes less than
when you asked last time.

05:14.514 --> 05:15.981
I need the keys
to the Hummer.

05:16.015 --> 05:18.040
- Where are you running?
- I got a meeting with Ari.

05:18.084 --> 05:19.642
- About what?
- Who the fuck knows?

05:19.686 --> 05:21.984
I'll meet you at Warners'.
Make sure he's on time.

05:22.021 --> 05:24.319
You're being very hard
on me today, E.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.462
- Hey, Lloyd.
- Wrong way, Eric.

05:30.496 --> 05:33.158
Today we're in the war room.
Follow me.

05:33.199 --> 05:35.599
- War room?
- It's really just a conference room,

05:35.635 --> 05:38.069
but Ari likes to refer
to it as "the war room."

05:38.104 --> 05:39.731
Makes him feel
like a gladiator.

05:39.772 --> 05:42.172
- Everybody's waiting for you.
- Who's everybody?

05:42.208 --> 05:44.267
Mandy's people,
and they don't look happy.

05:44.310 --> 05:46.278
But don't worry,
I got you your favorite--

05:46.312 --> 05:49.110
- Mrs. Beasley's chocolate chip muffins.
- Thanks, Lloyd.

05:49.148 --> 05:52.015
Little memory trick when they
introduce themselves-- word association.

05:52.051 --> 05:53.916
Like, you say "Eric Murphy"
and I think, "loser."

05:53.953 --> 05:55.750
- Like "Ari Gold"-- "douchebag"?
- Mm-hmm.

05:55.788 --> 05:58.780
Hey everybody, this is
Vinnie's manager Eric Murphy.

05:58.825 --> 06:01.020
Say hello to Mandy's
manager Phyllis,

06:01.060 --> 06:03.426
Mandy's music agent Mark,

06:03.463 --> 06:05.488
Mandy's publicist Stan,

06:05.531 --> 06:08.694
her attorney Jeff,
her music manager Craig,

06:08.735 --> 06:10.794
and most importantly,
her theatrical agent

06:10.837 --> 06:13.328
and one of my earliest mentors
Barbara Miller.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.467
So, Ari, who's gonna be
running this shindig, you or me?

06:16.509 --> 06:19.876
You've got the biggest cock in the room,
Babs. Why don't you kick it off?

06:19.912 --> 06:21.470
Oh, I don't know
about that, Ari.

06:21.514 --> 06:23.641
We haven't seen Eric's yet.

06:35.261 --> 06:37.354
Yo, Vince, this shit
is hot. Who is it?

06:37.397 --> 06:40.059
- No clue.
- Sounds like Eminem to me.

06:40.099 --> 06:42.624
What do you know
about hip hop, Drama?

06:42.668 --> 06:45.330
Are you crazy, bro?
I'm O.G.

06:45.371 --> 06:47.999
O.G.? The last
hip-hop CD you bought

06:48.040 --> 06:50.235
was the Kid 'N Play
box set.

06:50.276 --> 06:52.335
- So who is it then?
- I never heard it before.

06:52.378 --> 06:53.572
Yeah, me neither.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.343
Since when does E
listen to rap music?

06:56.382 --> 06:58.475
"Saigon."
Four tracks.

06:58.518 --> 07:00.952
- It's a demo?
- No way that's E's.

07:00.987 --> 07:03.854
He knows as much about
the rap music business as Willie Nelson.

07:03.890 --> 07:05.687
So this idiot thief
forgot his demo?

07:05.725 --> 07:07.784
How lazy could this guy be?

07:07.827 --> 07:09.658
It's got his address
and his phone number on it.

07:09.695 --> 07:11.287
We should call the cops.

07:11.330 --> 07:13.525
This Saigon could be
a three-strike offender.

07:13.566 --> 07:15.090
We could put him away for life.

07:15.134 --> 07:18.331
Oh yeah, you are
truly O.G., Johnny.

07:22.642 --> 07:26.578
Yo, Vince, think about this song
for the end of "QB"

07:26.612 --> 07:29.513
you on the screen,
the rain pouring down.

07:29.549 --> 07:32.017
You say "l am
Queens Boulevard"-- bang,

07:32.051 --> 07:34.019
this song comes on.

07:34.053 --> 07:37.079
That's a good idea, Turtle.
I'll call Walsh, set up the meeting.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.717
Yeah? Yeah,
I'll go with you.

07:39.759 --> 07:42.956
Uh, no, you go alone. No way I'm telling
Walsh how to score his movie.

07:42.995 --> 07:44.792
That guy's crazy.

07:44.831 --> 07:47.459
So, Vince miss meetings
a lot, Eric?

07:47.500 --> 07:50.264
- No, not really.
- 'Cause Mandy doesn't miss meetings.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.930
Mandy doesn't ever
miss meetings.

07:51.971 --> 07:53.598
- Cool.
- In fact...

07:53.639 --> 07:55.732
Mandy hasn't missed
a meeting in 1 5 years.

07:55.775 --> 07:58.903
- She's never even been late.
- Once, but that was during the riots.

07:58.945 --> 08:02.073
Wow. Sounds like you have
a tremendously punctual client.

08:02.114 --> 08:03.741
This is not fucking funny, Eric.

08:03.783 --> 08:06.081
No it's not. So why don't you
tell me why I'm here?

08:06.118 --> 08:08.177
You're here because
Vince isn't the only one

08:08.221 --> 08:10.951
who missed a meeting today.
Mandy did too.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.049
What are you saying?
Vince is a bad influence?

08:13.092 --> 08:14.787
Eric, we both know

08:14.827 --> 08:17.193
Vince has fucked
half the actresses in this town.

08:17.230 --> 08:20.028
Mandy, on the other hand,
is a good girl.

08:20.066 --> 08:22.864
You gonna sit there and let them
bad-mouth Vince like this?

08:22.902 --> 08:25.928
- Thought that was a compliment.
- Nobody's bad-mouthing Vince.

08:25.972 --> 08:27.940
- Yeah, we love Vince.
- Vince is adorable.

08:27.974 --> 08:30.340
They're just asking you,
as his personal manager,

08:30.376 --> 08:33.607
to get Vince to put this relationship
on hold until the movie's over.

08:33.645 --> 08:36.945
Ari, the guy's in love. He's not going
to put his relationship on hold.

08:36.982 --> 08:39.212
But I promise you he will be
where he needs to be.

08:39.251 --> 08:42.312
You guys do the same thing
with Mandy and we'll be fine.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.448
Okay? We done?
Nice meeting you.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.525
Eric.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.357
You don't want to wind up
spinning dough

08:49.395 --> 08:51.329
at that fucking
pizza place again, do you?

08:53.733 --> 08:55.223
Told her a little bit
about you.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.338
Listen, Babs,

08:59.372 --> 09:01.465
you don't want
to talk to me like that.

09:01.507 --> 09:04.340
'Cause I don't care who you are.
Yes, I am Vince's manager,

09:04.377 --> 09:07.175
but we've also been best friends
since we were six years old

09:07.213 --> 09:09.181
and I don't appreciate
sitting in a room

09:09.215 --> 09:12.616
discussing his personal life
with a bunch of fuckin' strangers.

09:14.420 --> 09:16.888
- Eric--
- You sandbag me like that me again,

09:16.923 --> 09:19.118
we're gonna have
a big fuckin' problem.

09:19.158 --> 09:21.023
We have a big fuckin'
problem right now!

09:21.060 --> 09:22.425
If you don't take
this seriously

09:22.461 --> 09:24.190
the whole fuckin' movie's
gonna go down in flames.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.289
- I told you I had it under control.
- Really?

09:26.332 --> 09:28.095
- Yeah.
- I didn't tell you this.

09:28.134 --> 09:30.432
- Tell me what?
- This stays between the two of us.

09:30.469 --> 09:33.734
- Speak, Ari!
- You have to take this seriously.

09:33.773 --> 09:36.139
You can't tell Vince,
'cause it will freak him out.

09:36.175 --> 09:38.143
You promise me?

09:38.177 --> 09:40.475
- I promise.
- All right.

09:40.513 --> 09:42.879
James Cameron called.

09:42.915 --> 09:46.009
- And?
- He said that Vince can be replaced.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.224
- Going down?
- It looks like we all are.

10:00.533 --> 10:02.501
Look, I'm sorry about
that pizza remark.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.366
Sorry I came back
at you so hard.

10:04.403 --> 10:06.633
You were just doing what
you were supposed to do.

10:06.672 --> 10:09.300
- Protecting your client, right?
- That's right.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.469
So who else
do you represent, Eric?

10:11.510 --> 10:12.943
Oh, right.
Just Vince.

10:12.979 --> 10:14.674
You want to start
in again, Barbara?

10:14.714 --> 10:17.615
My point is
I have 100 clients.

10:17.650 --> 10:19.845
So if I'm this worried
about one of 100,

10:19.885 --> 10:22.752
how worried should you
be about one of one?

10:22.788 --> 10:25.120
That's some apology,
Barbara.

10:43.876 --> 10:45.867
- Hey, Billy.
- Oh!

10:45.911 --> 10:48.436
What, did the kids
run away from home?

10:48.481 --> 10:51.211
I'll call the front desk.
I'll have them send up a futon.

10:51.250 --> 10:54.845
- We're not here for a sleepover, Bill.
- Oh, really?

10:54.887 --> 10:56.514
Well what are you
here for then?

10:56.555 --> 10:59.251
I'm here to get a couple
of my scenes put back in the movie.

10:59.291 --> 11:01.156
I got a hot song
for "Queens Boulevard."

11:01.193 --> 11:04.754
Thanks, but no thanks. I'm scoring
the whole thing myself with a sitar.

11:04.797 --> 11:06.424
- What else?
- Come on, Billy.

11:06.465 --> 11:08.729
You know the studio ain't
gonna release the movie

11:08.768 --> 11:10.235
with that music
you had in at Sundance.

11:10.269 --> 11:12.066
You need a bangin'
soundtrack.

11:12.104 --> 11:13.696
I don't give a fuck
if they release it.

11:13.739 --> 11:15.707
All I care about is if it's
the best movie it could be.

11:15.741 --> 11:17.936
You put my liquor store
meltdown scene back in,

11:17.977 --> 11:20.343
you get an lndependent
Spirit Award guaranteed.

11:20.379 --> 11:22.347
Guys, I got a busy day.

11:22.381 --> 11:23.848
- Just give it a listen.
- No.

11:23.883 --> 11:26.283
- Why not?
- Because I already picked the songs.

11:26.318 --> 11:28.115
I don't want my
head getting confused.

11:28.154 --> 11:31.123
Billy, I know music.
All right? Trust me.

11:32.825 --> 11:34.588
All right, but I want
Johnny's watch.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.328
What?

11:37.363 --> 11:39.763
No problem.
Give him your watch.

11:39.799 --> 11:41.767
I ain't givin' him my watch.

11:41.801 --> 11:45.362
I'll put the liquor store scene back in
and I'll listen to the song.

11:47.473 --> 11:49.134
Deal.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.780
I was gonna put
that scene back in anyway.

11:56.816 --> 11:58.807
Now play your
funky music, white boy.

12:19.505 --> 12:20.995
I love it.

12:22.441 --> 12:24.102
End titles.

12:24.143 --> 12:26.111
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

12:26.145 --> 12:29.205
We got $10,000 left for music,
that's it. Who owns the rights?

12:32.017 --> 12:36.386
Great job, Turtle. You just sold
a song you don't own.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.390
You know what my pops
used to say?

12:38.424 --> 12:40.392
"l wish I had a daughter"?

12:40.426 --> 12:42.394
No. "Sell it,
don't smell it."

12:42.428 --> 12:44.089
Don't worry,
we'll get the rights.

12:44.130 --> 12:46.496
- How?
- We'll wing it, my man.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.341
What the fuck is the matter
with you, Vince?

13:05.384 --> 13:07.409
That's the 17th whale
you've killed today.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.182
They're the biggest targets, Dale.

13:09.221 --> 13:11.655
Yes, and they are also
Aquaman's biggest friends.

13:11.690 --> 13:14.250
You kill the whales
and then all you've got left

13:14.293 --> 13:16.591
is a pod
of pissed-off sharks.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.894
An hour late.
Must have been some meeting.

13:19.932 --> 13:22.423
- Yeah. How's it going in here?
- Not going worth a shit.

13:22.468 --> 13:25.596
The boy here has killed more whales
than the Japanese fishing fleet.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.697
- This thing is impossible.
- You gotta focus.

13:27.740 --> 13:30.174
- You don't think I'm focused?
- You killed 17 whales?

13:30.209 --> 13:33.269
And three dolphins--
also Aquaman amigos.

13:33.312 --> 13:36.611
- Jesus.
- It's a fucking claw, E!

13:36.649 --> 13:39.550
They just invented this.
Nobody's ever used this before.

13:39.585 --> 13:41.985
Stop crying. I'm gonna get
some more harpoons.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.616
All right, E.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.683
What's up?

13:47.726 --> 13:49.421
Obviously something
has upset you.

13:49.461 --> 13:52.157
A lot of people are upset
you missed your physical.

13:52.198 --> 13:55.133
- What people? Ari?
- No, Mandy's people too.

13:55.167 --> 13:58.034
- They were there? Why?
- They think you're a bad influence.

13:58.070 --> 14:00.163
Me? It was her alarm clock
that didn't go off.

14:00.206 --> 14:01.901
- Come, on Vince, really.
- No, you come on.

14:01.941 --> 14:05.274
You actually sat in a meeting
and discussed my personal life?

14:05.311 --> 14:08.610
No, as soon as I figured out what they
wanted, I told them all to fuck off.

14:08.647 --> 14:10.274
You told Barbara Miller
to fuck off?

14:10.316 --> 14:12.443
Yeah. Nobody talks shit
about you except me.

14:12.484 --> 14:15.112
Good looking out, E.

14:15.154 --> 14:17.645
- Are we in this together?
- Of course we are.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.056
You promise me you're not
gonna fuck up this movie?

14:20.092 --> 14:22.583
E, I wouldn't fuck up
my career over a girl.

14:22.628 --> 14:25.188
Any girl. Never.

14:25.231 --> 14:26.698
You believe me, right?

14:26.732 --> 14:28.700
Yeah.

14:28.734 --> 14:31.100
- But...
- But what?

14:31.136 --> 14:33.627
- You still seem a little freaked out.
- No, I'm good.

14:33.672 --> 14:35.333
E?

14:36.842 --> 14:39.106
- I shouldn't tell you this.
- No, come on, E,

14:39.144 --> 14:42.011
we don't hold shit back
from each other, remember?

14:42.047 --> 14:44.982
- Ari made me promise.
- So you crossed your fingers, right?

14:45.017 --> 14:47.611
- Yeah, of course.
- So what is it?

14:47.653 --> 14:49.644
- Cameron called this morning.
- And?

14:49.688 --> 14:52.452
He said you can
be replaced.

15:03.135 --> 15:05.262
This is crazy
coming down here not strapped.

15:05.304 --> 15:07.238
You don't even
own a gun, Drama.

15:07.273 --> 15:09.241
I don't need a gun,
Turtle.

15:09.275 --> 15:11.243
All I needed
was my nunchucks,

15:11.277 --> 15:12.904
but you wouldn't
stop by the house.

15:12.945 --> 15:15.072
Why? So you're gonna walk
down Slauson Boulevard

15:15.114 --> 15:17.344
with nunchucks stickin'
out of your back pocket?

15:17.383 --> 15:20.284
No, I would have concealed them
in my Frye boots.

15:20.319 --> 15:22.879
Your pants are so taped
you'd never be able to get 'em out.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.857
- Look how tight these things are.
- Get off 'em.

15:25.891 --> 15:29.327
- Yo, this is it.
- 345.

15:42.808 --> 15:44.708
Just so you know,

15:44.743 --> 15:47.644
if anything goes down,
it's every man for himself.

15:58.524 --> 16:00.048
What are you two selling?

16:00.092 --> 16:02.060
We're-- uh, we're
looking for Saigon?

16:02.094 --> 16:05.495
You wouldn't happen to be
"Miss Saigon" would you?

16:05.531 --> 16:07.829
Oh, good. Like I've never
heard that shit before.

16:07.866 --> 16:09.356
What you looking
for my son for?

16:09.401 --> 16:11.961
We want to
make him rich.

16:12.004 --> 16:14.302
What are you,
drug dealers?

16:14.340 --> 16:16.467
Oh, no no,
we're music guys.

16:16.508 --> 16:17.975
Actually I'm
an actor, ma'am.

16:18.010 --> 16:21.969
You might have seen me
on "227" back in 1994.

16:22.014 --> 16:25.313
It is 3:30 on a Wednesday.
What would my boy be doing home?

16:25.351 --> 16:27.649
Would you mind telling us
where we could find him?

16:27.686 --> 16:30.655
At work.
5577 Rodeo Drive.

16:30.689 --> 16:32.452
Don't you mean
Ro-day-o?

16:32.491 --> 16:36.359
South of Jefferson
it's called Roh-deo.

16:36.395 --> 16:38.226
Stop being so white, Drama.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.767
I just can't believe he'd fire me
because I missed a physical.

16:42.801 --> 16:44.428
Well, it's not just
the physical, Vince.

16:44.470 --> 16:45.937
He knows about
you and Mandy.

16:45.971 --> 16:48.735
I talked to him about me
and Mandy. He gets it.

16:48.774 --> 16:50.469
Well, what do you
want me to tell you?

16:50.509 --> 16:52.636
Tell me why anyone
would bother James Cameron

16:52.678 --> 16:54.475
with the news that
I missed a physical.

16:54.513 --> 16:56.538
Actors reschedule
physicals all the time.

16:56.582 --> 16:58.812
- What can I say, Vince?
- There's nothing to say.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.376
I just--
I don't believe it.

17:03.155 --> 17:05.749
So, what?
You think Ari's lying?

17:07.092 --> 17:09.583
- Hey Lloyd.
- Hey, boys.

17:09.627 --> 17:11.357
Did James Cameron
call this morning?

17:11.396 --> 17:13.330
Um, I was at the dentist
this morning.

17:13.365 --> 17:15.333
- Annual cleaning.
- We'll ask Ari.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.834
Um, he's in a staff meeting.

17:16.868 --> 17:18.859
- We'll wait.
- Thanks, Lloyd.

17:19.972 --> 17:21.633
What's up, player?

17:21.673 --> 17:23.503
- What are you doing?
- Saying hello.

17:23.541 --> 17:25.009
Don't be ignorant,
Turtle.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.103
You can't just waltz
in here and say "hello."

17:27.146 --> 17:31.014
You gotta show respect.
Walk the walk and talk the talk.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.950
Where the fuck do you
think we are, Drama?

17:32.985 --> 17:35.010
Trust me, Turtle, this ain't
your neighborhood body shop.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.181
It's a whole 'nother scene.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.315
Hello, gentlemen, I'm Robin.
How can I help you?

17:39.358 --> 17:40.825
How you doin', girl?

17:40.859 --> 17:44.420
We're looking for a silky-smooth
rhyming cat named Saigon.

17:44.463 --> 17:46.158
Was that English?

17:48.467 --> 17:50.560
- He's out back.
- Thank you.

17:55.841 --> 17:58.605
Excuse me.
One of you guys Saigon?

17:58.644 --> 18:01.135
That depends.

18:02.214 --> 18:03.681
What you want?

18:03.715 --> 18:06.411
Circular motions will
keep the rag marks off that beast.

18:06.452 --> 18:08.943
We want to talk
to Saigon about this.

18:08.987 --> 18:10.454
Where'd you get that?

18:10.489 --> 18:12.480
Yo, don't sweat it, bro.
We ain't the po-pos.

18:12.524 --> 18:14.185
Who the fuck are
you calling bro?

18:14.226 --> 18:17.423
Take it easy, coz. I'm Saigon.
Where'd you get that from?

18:17.463 --> 18:19.192
Found it in our Maserati.

18:19.231 --> 18:22.291
Yeah, the one that was stolen
out in front of Nacional last night?

18:22.334 --> 18:24.768
- Stolen?
- It was Vincent Chase's car.

18:24.803 --> 18:26.361
Vinnie Chase the actor?

18:26.405 --> 18:27.872
- Mm-hmm.
- Shit.

18:27.906 --> 18:30.636
You said it was Steve Berman's
from lnterscope, dumbass!

18:30.676 --> 18:32.576
That's what
the motherfucker drives.

18:32.611 --> 18:36.172
How should I know there's
two of the same damn car at one place?

18:36.215 --> 18:38.740
Listen man, we might have dropped
my demo in your car,

18:38.784 --> 18:40.342
but we ain't
take it for a ride.

18:40.385 --> 18:41.852
Try selling that
to the judge.

18:41.887 --> 18:44.117
What judge you talking about,
motherfucker?

18:44.156 --> 18:47.125
Look, I want to use one of your tracks
in Vince's new movie.

18:48.327 --> 18:50.295
Is there any brothers
in this movie?

18:50.329 --> 18:53.196
Yeah, I think I saw
one in that bar scene.

18:53.232 --> 18:56.167
Man, fuck that. Hold out
for John Singleton's next movie.

18:56.201 --> 18:57.964
I got 10 Gs
for a track, fellas.

18:58.003 --> 18:59.971
All right.
You give me that paper,

19:00.005 --> 19:02.235
and you two got
yourself a client.

19:03.275 --> 19:04.742
That is why
y'all here, right?

19:04.776 --> 19:06.243
Y'all want to manage me.

19:06.278 --> 19:08.746
Not me, I got my own
flourishing career to manage.

19:08.780 --> 19:12.181
- Yeah? What you do?
- Tries to act like he isn't retarded.

19:12.217 --> 19:15.550
I'm the manager. I'd be thrilled
if you let me represent you.

19:15.587 --> 19:17.782
Yeah, and I'd be thrilled
if I get 10 Gs.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.757
- I hear that.
- What's up?

19:21.894 --> 19:24.362
Uh oh, you boys
look angry.

19:24.396 --> 19:27.194
If there was plastic on the floor
I'd think I was about to be whacked.

19:27.232 --> 19:29.063
Did James Cameron
call you today, Ari?

19:32.437 --> 19:34.064
You promised me
you wouldn't tell.

19:34.106 --> 19:36.301
He crossed his fingers.

19:37.709 --> 19:39.734
You looked me in the face
and you promised.

19:39.778 --> 19:41.245
Did he call?

19:41.280 --> 19:43.748
You little untrustworthy
cocksucker!

19:43.782 --> 19:46.876
Yes or no?
Did James Cameron call?

19:48.787 --> 19:50.812
Yes, he did.

19:50.856 --> 19:54.883
And I called E to motivate him
to motivate you.

19:54.927 --> 19:58.158
That was my mistake,
trusting E, and for that I apologize.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.597
- I can't believe it.
- Believe it!

20:00.632 --> 20:03.499
James Cameron cares about
every detail of all of his movies.

20:03.535 --> 20:05.093
- You should call him.
- No, you should not.

20:05.137 --> 20:07.037
You should go back
to doing your job.

20:07.072 --> 20:08.835
- I'm gonna call him.
- Put the phone down.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.933
I'm going to assure him
that I won't ever be late again.

20:10.976 --> 20:14.173
- Please, Vinnie, put the phone down.
- Why?

20:14.213 --> 20:15.942
Because, like Mandy,

20:15.981 --> 20:18.506
you have never missed
a meeting before.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.518
That's why this is troubling.

20:20.552 --> 20:23.146
- To Cameron?
- To me!

20:25.290 --> 20:27.349
He didn't call?

20:28.460 --> 20:30.428
- No, he did not call.
- Jesus Christ.

20:30.462 --> 20:32.430
No, you're fucking pathological.

20:32.464 --> 20:35.524
Listen, read Jack Welch,
Tony Robbins, Phil Jackson.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.626
Motivation!
This shit works!

20:37.669 --> 20:39.261
You want to be
Shaq or Kobe?

20:39.304 --> 20:41.204
Michael or Scotty?
Damon or Affleck?

20:41.240 --> 20:42.832
Do you want to be
out of our lives?

20:42.874 --> 20:44.637
'Cause this could seriously
be the end of you.

20:44.676 --> 20:46.803
I am your biggest fan.
I think you are this close

20:46.845 --> 20:50.212
to being the biggest movie star
on the planet, but you are slipping.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.910
Over a girl?

20:51.950 --> 20:55.351
I've never seen you like this
before and it worries me.

20:55.387 --> 20:58.356
- Worry about yourself. He's fine.
- No, E,

20:58.390 --> 21:01.450
he's right
to worry about me.

21:01.493 --> 21:04.985
You both are.
Fuck, I'm worried about me.

21:05.030 --> 21:08.124
Look at me. I've been lying
to you guys like a fucking drug addict.

21:11.169 --> 21:14.104
I-- I didn't oversleep.

21:14.139 --> 21:16.107
I didn't want to go.

21:16.141 --> 21:18.666
I never want to leave her side,
not for five seconds.

21:20.545 --> 21:22.513
I've never been like this
in my life, guys.

21:22.547 --> 21:23.912
And the truth
of the matter is

21:23.949 --> 21:26.179
I don't even give a fuck
about the movie anymore.

21:26.218 --> 21:29.619
I could live with Mandy in a one-bedroom
in Chatsworth and I'd be happy.

21:30.756 --> 21:33.554
It's nuts,
but it's the truth.

21:33.592 --> 21:36.060
- Vinnie...
- No, Ari...

21:36.094 --> 21:38.790
there's nothing more to say.
I'm sorry I lied.

21:38.830 --> 21:40.491
Vince!

21:44.569 --> 21:46.537
You think he bought it?

21:46.571 --> 21:48.539
You motherfucker.

21:48.573 --> 21:50.939
- Let him sleep on that.
- Keep walking.

21:52.778 --> 21:54.302
Well, did it ever occur to you

21:54.346 --> 21:57.042
that a 7:00 dinner
in Santa fucking Monica is too early?

21:57.082 --> 21:59.346
I'm sorry, baby. I had a bad day.
I will be there.

21:59.384 --> 22:01.352
I would not leave you
alone with my mother.

22:01.386 --> 22:03.479
I know what could happen.
Love and kisses.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.625
Ernesto,
where's my car?

22:07.659 --> 22:09.217
It's on its way,
Mr. Gold.

22:09.261 --> 22:11.252
Mr. McQuewick,
he called down also.

22:12.564 --> 22:14.088
How are things, Ari?

22:14.132 --> 22:16.498
Couldn't be better, Terence,
although it's 6:30.

22:16.535 --> 22:19.436
You're usually out of here
by noon, so this is a little odd, no?

22:19.471 --> 22:21.530
Why was Barbara Miller
at the offices today?

22:21.573 --> 22:25.100
Vinnie came down with a little case
of puppy love, but it's under control.

22:25.143 --> 22:27.077
Control's a funny thing,
isn't it, Ari?

22:27.112 --> 22:29.444
You don't realize
how little of it you have

22:29.481 --> 22:31.745
until you actually
have none of it at all.

22:31.783 --> 22:34.445
Keep track
of your boy, Ari.

22:34.486 --> 22:36.454
I'll be watching you.

22:36.488 --> 22:38.718
Cheerio!

22:43.829 --> 22:45.296
This looks phenomenal!

22:45.330 --> 22:47.264
- Nice, Drama--
- Hey hey hey...

22:47.299 --> 22:50.029
I figured the family needed
a little get-together.

22:50.068 --> 22:53.037
With you gone the last few days,
it's been a little off around here.

22:53.071 --> 22:54.698
We had dinner together
on Wednesday.

22:54.740 --> 22:57.470
- We missed you, bro.
- Thanks, Johnny.

22:57.509 --> 22:59.670
Bang!

22:59.711 --> 23:01.770
Turtle, this isn't
dinner music.

23:01.813 --> 23:04.509
Don't be a hater just 'cause you're
not the only manager in the house.

23:04.549 --> 23:07.416
The guy's the next Russell Simmons.
Who would have thunk it?

23:07.452 --> 23:08.919
- To Saigon.
- To "Aquaman."

23:08.954 --> 23:11.149
- To the family being together again.
- Yes.

23:11.189 --> 23:12.622
Cheers.

23:15.460 --> 23:16.927
It's Ari.

23:16.962 --> 23:18.930
Oh, this ought
to be good.

23:18.964 --> 23:20.989
I better check up
on that roast.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.728
Hey, Ari, what's up?

23:23.769 --> 23:26.636
What's up is it's intervention time,
baby. This is the plan:

23:26.671 --> 23:28.536
for $5,000 I can get
a cult deprogrammer

23:28.573 --> 23:30.404
to come in
and brainwash Vinnie.

23:30.442 --> 23:33.434
My sister Eileen went
to the Cornell Summer Program in '88,

23:33.478 --> 23:35.105
came back
a fuckin' moonie.

23:35.147 --> 23:36.774
Three sessions later
and bam--

23:36.815 --> 23:38.680
she's a pilates instructor
in Tenafly.

23:39.684 --> 23:41.276
He wants to have
an intervention.

23:41.319 --> 23:44.413
- What should I say?
- I don't know. Improvise.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.393
That sounds like
a great idea, Ari.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.395
You should have
him meet us in Napa.

23:50.429 --> 23:53.489
What's up in Napa? You guys
crushing grapes with Coppola?

23:53.532 --> 23:56.831
See, after your conversation
with Vince, he had a major meltdown.

23:56.868 --> 24:00.167
Feels he let you down, so he just
jumped in the car and drove up.

24:00.205 --> 24:03.038
- You fucking kidding me?
- Vince driving, can you believe that?

24:03.074 --> 24:04.666
That's how
fucked up he is.

24:04.709 --> 24:07.143
I'm behind him on the road
about 30 miles right now.

24:07.179 --> 24:09.147
He won't stop or answer
his cell phone.

24:09.181 --> 24:12.480
Says he's gonna shack up at
Auberge du Soleil and never come back.

24:12.517 --> 24:14.485
I could use
your help up there.

24:14.519 --> 24:16.714
- That's like a seven-hour drive.
- No shit.

24:16.755 --> 24:19.383
The traffic's not that bad,
but you know, whatever, Ari.

24:19.424 --> 24:21.756
Keep your phone on.
I'm heading north.

24:28.700 --> 24:30.998
- You think he bought it?
- Hook, line, and sinker.

24:31.036 --> 24:33.004
Way to sell it!

24:33.038 --> 24:35.165
Hey hey hey, you guys
ready for some roast?

24:35.207 --> 24:36.834
Yes, that looks good, Drama.
