WEBVTT

00:06.198 --> 00:08.499
All right, try it now.

00:12.922 --> 00:15.690
And there you have it.

00:15.692 --> 00:16.841
How'd you do that?

00:16.843 --> 00:18.192
Oh, did the same thing
I always do.

00:18.194 --> 00:20.278
I wiggled some wires around
until it started.

00:20.280 --> 00:22.663
You know, we got
to stop meeting like this.

00:22.665 --> 00:24.482
You, me,
and this pile of junk.

00:24.484 --> 00:26.651
Well, we can't
afford to fix it.

00:26.653 --> 00:28.335
Not with the boys'
tuition hikes.

00:28.337 --> 00:31.005
Speaking of which, I got an
estimate for the carpet repair.

00:31.007 --> 00:32.557
Yeah? And?

00:32.558 --> 00:34.525
It's as crappy
as the carpet.

00:34.527 --> 00:36.010
Great.

00:36.012 --> 00:38.210
So, what? Can you get another
loan on your pension?

00:38.235 --> 00:38.697
No.

00:38.698 --> 00:40.148
We maxed that out
already, babe.

00:40.150 --> 00:41.532
So what's the plan?

00:41.534 --> 00:44.952
The plan now is for you
to drive this beater home.

00:44.954 --> 00:47.205
Straight home and
do not stop, okay?

00:47.207 --> 00:49.540
And most of all,
do not worry about money.

00:49.542 --> 00:51.709
We'll be fine.

00:51.711 --> 00:54.829
Wait. What do I do
if that weird noise comes back?

00:54.831 --> 00:56.748
Just turn up the radio.

00:58.801 --> 01:00.451
Love you.

01:00.453 --> 01:02.053
Love you more.

01:02.055 --> 01:04.221
Love you most.

01:11.096 --> 01:13.097
Something smells good.

01:13.099 --> 01:14.682
Oh, <i>sí, señor.</i>

01:14.684 --> 01:16.884
My world-famous chili.

01:19.721 --> 01:23.691
Drink before dinner. Thanks.

01:23.693 --> 01:25.893
Cheers.
Cheers.

01:28.197 --> 01:31.199
Favorite part of my day--
dinner with my old man.

01:33.569 --> 01:36.454
Are you, uh, buttering me up
for some reason,

01:36.456 --> 01:37.872
Francis?

01:37.874 --> 01:40.041
I'm just happy to see you, Pop.

01:41.093 --> 01:44.762
So... how was your day?

01:44.764 --> 01:47.799
Great, honey. Yours?

01:52.137 --> 01:54.055
You got something on your mind,
spit it.

01:54.057 --> 01:56.257
What makes you think
I got something on my mind?

01:56.259 --> 01:58.192
You're not the only guy
in this room

01:58.194 --> 02:00.027
who used to wear
a gold shield, Francis.

02:00.029 --> 02:02.647
And when I was wearing mine,
you were wearing diapers.

02:05.217 --> 02:07.151
Well... I did notice

02:07.153 --> 02:10.571
there was a pretty big dent
in the bumper of your car.

02:10.573 --> 02:11.823
Oh, here we go.

02:11.825 --> 02:13.908
No, I'm just asking
what happened.

02:13.910 --> 02:15.209
No, you're insinuating.

02:15.211 --> 02:16.610
I'm not insinuating anything.

02:16.612 --> 02:18.779
The hell you're not.
You think I don't know

02:18.781 --> 02:20.464
what I'm doing
behind the wheel anymore.

02:20.466 --> 02:23.134
I'm just asking
what happened to your car.

02:23.136 --> 02:24.385
How would I know?

02:24.387 --> 02:25.887
I went into Ziggy's for lunch.

02:25.889 --> 02:27.955
I came out,
I had a busted bumper.

02:27.957 --> 02:30.007
So somebody hit you
when you were inside?

02:30.009 --> 02:31.392
Excellent police work.

02:31.394 --> 02:34.178
And they didn't leave a note?
Are you finished?

02:34.180 --> 02:36.681
Damn it, Pop,
you shouldn't be driving!

02:37.533 --> 02:39.483
Go to hell!

02:41.000 --> 02:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:02.291 --> 03:04.292
Vance.

03:04.294 --> 03:06.377
Am I about to get spanked?

03:06.379 --> 03:08.379
Because I... I think
I'm gonna like it.

03:08.381 --> 03:09.847
What are you doing here?

03:09.849 --> 03:11.682
Not expecting you to show up.

03:11.684 --> 03:14.018
You promised me
that you would lay low

03:14.020 --> 03:16.170
until <i>after</i> you testify
on Monday.

03:16.172 --> 03:17.939
It's my show!

03:17.941 --> 03:19.307
Come on!

03:19.309 --> 03:22.760
I'm donating all the proceeds
to charity, which makes me

03:22.762 --> 03:24.178
a-a great guy.

03:24.180 --> 03:26.697
What...? Drink with me.
Where's a waiter?

03:26.699 --> 03:28.532
Waiter?
Do you not care at all

03:28.534 --> 03:30.601
that Bill Greenfield
has threatened your life?

03:30.603 --> 03:33.371
Quaking in fear is not my style.

03:33.373 --> 03:35.323
And botching my grand jury
presentation because

03:35.325 --> 03:38.542
my star witness has gotten
himself killed is not mine.

03:38.544 --> 03:39.911
Sir, champagne?

03:39.913 --> 03:41.379
No, thank you.
We're leaving.

03:41.381 --> 03:42.964
Call your driver.

03:42.966 --> 03:44.882
Really?
Really.

03:51.423 --> 03:54.375
Marvin, it's time to go home.

03:55.344 --> 03:57.845
Well, there. Are you happy?

03:57.847 --> 04:00.431
Yeah, and I trust
that you're gonna get in the car

04:00.433 --> 04:01.983
all by yourself. Let's go.

04:01.985 --> 04:05.886
You know, Erin,
I'm planning a new series

04:05.888 --> 04:07.722
on the city's leading lights.

04:07.724 --> 04:10.825
I'd love to include a photo
of Manhattan's top ADA.

04:10.827 --> 04:13.778
Well, if I can be strangling
you in it, then I'm in.

04:13.780 --> 04:15.579
Where's your car?

04:15.581 --> 04:16.781
There he is.

04:18.785 --> 04:19.784
Wait!

04:23.373 --> 04:24.789
Stay there.

04:27.410 --> 04:28.676
My name is Erin Reagan.

04:28.678 --> 04:29.927
I'm a Manhattan ADA.

04:29.929 --> 04:31.379
I just witnessed a hit-and-run.

04:31.381 --> 04:33.264
There's a man hurt.

04:33.266 --> 04:36.050
I'm on 18th Street
just west of

04:36.052 --> 04:40.304
10th Avenue.
I need an ambulance immediately.

05:06.590 --> 05:08.841
Ah, come on. It was nothing.

05:08.843 --> 05:10.810
You-you were hit
by a car, Vance.

05:10.812 --> 05:13.796
Bumped. Nothing another glass
of champagne won't cure.

05:13.798 --> 05:15.315
Steer me to the nearest bar.

05:15.317 --> 05:17.350
This woman would like
to buy me a drink.

05:17.352 --> 05:20.603
Obviously straight
to the hospital, no stopping.

05:20.605 --> 05:21.904
I'll miss you.

05:21.906 --> 05:23.723
Oh, um,

05:23.725 --> 05:26.859
the car that you need
to look for-- it's a town car.

05:26.861 --> 05:28.945
Four-door, black, slate gray,

05:28.947 --> 05:32.782
and the license plate started
with T-two-zero.

05:32.784 --> 05:35.284
Wish every witness was a Reagan.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.996
Hi, Dad.

05:46.998 --> 05:48.765
This is a nice surprise.

05:48.767 --> 05:50.750
Thank you, Baker.

05:50.752 --> 05:53.919
Well, you haven't heard
why I'm here yet.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.872
Okay.

05:55.874 --> 05:58.658
I know how you feel about
this kind of thing, but I

05:58.660 --> 06:01.394
called in a favor
with Sergeant Gormley

06:01.396 --> 06:03.896
to pull Danny onto a case.

06:03.898 --> 06:07.116
Well, you don't trade
on the Reagan name, sweetie,

06:07.118 --> 06:09.569
so you must have felt
it was necessary

06:09.571 --> 06:12.071
and I'm sure Gormley felt
it was warranted.

06:12.073 --> 06:16.376
Well, I'll deny it till my
death, but Danny is the best.

06:16.378 --> 06:17.877
Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?

06:17.879 --> 06:18.911
Beyond.

06:19.964 --> 06:22.131
And he'll do a good job
on the case,

06:22.133 --> 06:25.051
but he might even be able
to make a few extra bucks

06:25.053 --> 06:26.552
moonlighting
for my star witness.

06:26.554 --> 06:27.870
Why would he want to?

06:27.872 --> 06:29.672
Well, you didn't hear it
from me,

06:29.674 --> 06:31.674
but he and Linda
are going through

06:31.676 --> 06:33.176
a rough patch financially.

06:33.178 --> 06:36.846
And he would kill me if he
knew I was saying anything.

06:36.848 --> 06:39.932
Yeah. Make a deal with you.

06:40.984 --> 06:43.853
I'll keep your secret
if you return the favor.

06:43.855 --> 06:47.473
Uh-oh.

06:47.475 --> 06:52.111
Your grandfather
had another fender bender.

06:52.113 --> 06:53.362
That's the fourth time.

06:53.364 --> 06:55.314
In two months.

06:55.316 --> 06:57.900
Way he sees it, the garage
keeps crashing into him.

06:57.902 --> 06:59.669
Dad, this is getting dangerous.

06:59.671 --> 07:02.588
I mean, he could really
hurt himself, or someone else.

07:02.590 --> 07:05.842
Well, that's pretty much
what I told him.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.662
But it wasn't my finest hour.

07:09.664 --> 07:11.798
I meant what I said,

07:11.800 --> 07:14.834
but I just didn't say it
the way I should have.

07:14.836 --> 07:16.502
I'm surprised
you're still walking.

07:18.106 --> 07:21.357
I know it's a tough talk
to have,

07:21.359 --> 07:24.343
especially with someone
as proud as Grandpa, but...

07:24.345 --> 07:26.145
you're gonna have to do it.

07:26.147 --> 07:27.213
It's getting serious.

07:29.183 --> 07:31.150
It isn't going to be easy.

07:31.152 --> 07:34.704
Nothing worthwhile ever is.

07:34.706 --> 07:37.907
Do you know how much I hate it
when you quote me back to me?

07:37.909 --> 07:39.926
How much?
A lot.

07:46.366 --> 07:47.834
Protective custody?

07:47.836 --> 07:49.836
You want me to sit at home?

07:49.838 --> 07:51.137
Just until

07:51.139 --> 07:52.955
you testify on Monday morning.

07:52.957 --> 07:54.373
That's three days away.

07:54.375 --> 07:56.008
Well, that will give you
plenty of time

07:56.010 --> 07:57.093
to get to know the detective

07:57.095 --> 07:58.578
who's going to be
looking after you.

07:58.580 --> 08:00.429
I don't need a babysitter.

08:00.431 --> 08:02.715
If you keep complaining,
I'll get you two.

08:02.717 --> 08:06.769
So you really think Greenfield
hired someone to kill me?

08:06.771 --> 08:08.888
That's what
I'm here to figure out.

08:08.890 --> 08:12.408
Vance Bradley,
Detective Danny Reagan.

08:12.410 --> 08:15.361
Another Reagan
in law enforcement?

08:15.363 --> 08:16.662
Family tradition going back

08:16.664 --> 08:18.531
to the Ice Age.
This is the photographer who...

08:18.533 --> 08:21.117
Oh, believe me, everybody knows
who Bad Boy Bradley is.

08:21.119 --> 08:23.119
But don't you think
you're a little old

08:23.121 --> 08:25.505
to be running around,
acting like a club kid?

08:25.507 --> 08:26.739
It's nice to meet you, too.

08:26.741 --> 08:29.208
Yeah. How's your pal
Dr. Greenfield doing?

08:29.210 --> 08:32.010
<i>Former</i> pal. He tried
to have me killed last night.

08:32.013 --> 08:34.764
What happened?
No honor among skeeves?

08:35.465 --> 08:36.682
Okay, guys.

08:37.601 --> 08:39.552
I hear Dr. Greenfield's
using his practice

08:39.554 --> 08:41.136
to illegally deal
prescription narcotics.

08:41.139 --> 08:43.606
In fact, until the DA's
office cut you a deal

08:43.607 --> 08:45.725
and gave you immunity
on your drug charges,

08:45.727 --> 08:47.393
I'd say you two were
pretty much alike.

08:47.395 --> 08:49.312
So how'd you get
to know this guy?

08:49.314 --> 08:50.429
You a patient or a customer?

08:50.431 --> 08:52.949
More like a running buddy,
but I saw...

08:52.951 --> 08:55.201
...I saw Bill do deals

08:55.203 --> 08:56.786
with a lot of bad guys.

08:56.788 --> 08:59.455
Street dealers,
people from Mexican cartels...

08:59.457 --> 09:01.541
Yeah, you also saw him
hand a bunch of pills

09:01.543 --> 09:02.992
to a young girl
named Becca Reynolds

09:02.994 --> 09:04.109
at a nightclub
called Terrain

09:04.111 --> 09:05.110
where she OD'd, but you didn't

09:05.112 --> 09:06.212
do a damn thing to stop him.

09:06.214 --> 09:08.714
Okay, he is
a cooperating witness.

09:08.716 --> 09:09.999
He's not on trial here.

09:10.001 --> 09:12.168
Well, that's a pity.

09:12.170 --> 09:13.803
You have anything
on the car yet?

09:13.805 --> 09:15.638
They found the car
in Washington Heights.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.089
It was stolen and wiped down.

09:17.091 --> 09:19.091
There's no, uh,
usable forensics on it.

09:19.093 --> 09:20.643
My next stop is to see

09:20.645 --> 09:22.845
what Bill Greenfield has to say
for himself.

09:22.847 --> 09:24.313
Look, are we done here?

09:24.315 --> 09:26.432
I'd like to head home
at some point today.

09:26.434 --> 09:29.569
I'll check with the doctor, see
if you're ready for discharge.

09:32.823 --> 09:35.658
Charming as ever.

09:35.660 --> 09:37.360
All right, I apologize, okay?

09:37.362 --> 09:39.245
I appreciate
the extra tours.

09:39.247 --> 09:41.113
I sure could use the money.

09:41.115 --> 09:43.366
I don't know why you just don't
ask Dad for some money.

09:43.368 --> 09:44.367
You kidding me?

09:44.369 --> 09:46.652
He gave me some
after Jack and I split.

09:46.654 --> 09:48.487
I don't take some allowance
from Dad, all right?

09:48.489 --> 09:50.957
I'd rather take money from a
stranger than take it from him.

09:50.959 --> 09:52.375
Oh, that makes a lot of sense.

09:52.377 --> 09:53.376
Can we just drop it?

09:53.378 --> 09:54.827
All right?

09:54.829 --> 09:56.596
I appreciate your help,
and do me a favor.

09:56.598 --> 09:58.214
Don't tell Linda
about the tours, all right?

09:58.216 --> 09:59.432
She's got enough
to worry about.

09:59.434 --> 10:01.183
I won't. Bye.

10:01.185 --> 10:03.185
I'll see you.

10:04.606 --> 10:06.355
No, I-I kid you not.

10:06.357 --> 10:08.641
We won a bunch of
battle of the bands

10:08.643 --> 10:09.525
all through college.

10:09.527 --> 10:11.010
I seriously thought
of becoming

10:11.012 --> 10:12.728
a musician
instead of a cop.

10:12.730 --> 10:14.013
Never too late
to switch back.

10:14.015 --> 10:15.548
Whoa.

10:15.550 --> 10:17.950
Hello.

10:17.952 --> 10:19.602
Here we go again.

10:19.604 --> 10:21.203
What's that mean?

10:21.205 --> 10:22.805
Every time you
see a cute girl,

10:22.807 --> 10:24.840
our tour comes
to a grinding halt

10:24.842 --> 10:26.826
while you try and get
her phone number.

10:26.828 --> 10:28.377
I don't try to get
their number.

10:28.379 --> 10:29.612
I get their number.

10:29.614 --> 10:32.164
But do they actually
pick up when you call?

10:32.166 --> 10:33.382
Reagan, just...

10:33.384 --> 10:35.968
stick to playing with
your <i>Star Wars</i> toys, huh?

10:35.970 --> 10:39.088
Uh-oh. Do I need
a permit or something?

10:39.090 --> 10:40.589
Actually, ma'am,
selling anything

10:40.591 --> 10:41.974
other than
written material

10:41.976 --> 10:43.342
requires a city license.

10:43.344 --> 10:44.510
Luckily, there's no law

10:44.512 --> 10:46.062
against a girl
being too beautiful.

10:48.432 --> 10:50.266
Wow. Did you
make all this?

10:50.268 --> 10:51.567
By hand.

10:51.569 --> 10:53.903
You know, I was looking
for something for my mom.

10:53.905 --> 10:55.554
You know, it's not
her birthday or anything,

10:55.556 --> 10:57.273
but I just figured
I'd brighten her day.

10:57.275 --> 10:58.607
Aw.

10:58.609 --> 11:00.359
Your partner's got a big heart.

11:00.361 --> 11:02.611
Yep, he's a special guy.

11:02.613 --> 11:04.830
I'll take the necklace.

11:04.832 --> 11:06.282
Your mom will love it.

11:06.284 --> 11:08.501
This stone has amazing energy.

11:08.503 --> 11:10.536
Only because of who made it.

11:11.839 --> 11:14.573
Anything for you?

11:14.575 --> 11:16.258
Not unless you sell Tums.

11:17.094 --> 11:18.594
Here you go.

11:18.596 --> 11:19.845
Thank you.

11:19.847 --> 11:21.213
I'm Vinny, by the way.

11:21.215 --> 11:22.765
And, uh, what do I owe you?

11:22.767 --> 11:23.933
Holly.

11:23.935 --> 11:25.417
And you owe me nothing.

11:25.419 --> 11:26.936
Officer Cruz,
you know that we can't

11:26.938 --> 11:28.604
accept gifts from the public.

11:28.606 --> 11:30.089
He's right.

11:30.091 --> 11:32.224
Unless there's another way
I can repay you.

11:32.226 --> 11:34.527
Actually,
you could do me a favor.

11:34.529 --> 11:35.811
It's my son, Justin.

11:35.813 --> 11:37.096
He's a good kid,

11:37.098 --> 11:39.815
but he hangs around with a bunch
of older boys all day,

11:39.817 --> 11:42.101
playing video games
and not doing his homework.

11:42.103 --> 11:45.287
The place is right around
the corner-- 228 Westgate.

11:45.289 --> 11:46.872
Where's Justin's dad?

11:46.874 --> 11:47.990
Long gone.

11:47.992 --> 11:49.992
Which is why it
would be nice for him

11:49.994 --> 11:52.611
to get a visit
from some positive role models.

11:55.465 --> 11:58.300
Well, we are at
your service, Holly.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.705
The eagle has landed.

12:02.707 --> 12:03.889
Again.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.674
Didn't get her number.

12:05.676 --> 12:08.044
Probably 'cause she was
too busy smiling at me.

12:08.046 --> 12:09.445
Okay.

12:09.447 --> 12:12.098
Now you're delusional
there, buddy.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.450
There's 228.

12:14.452 --> 12:15.684
Smells like Justin
and his buddies

12:15.686 --> 12:16.986
are smoking a
little something

12:16.988 --> 12:18.283
while they're playing
their video games.

12:18.308 --> 12:19.332
Yeah.

12:34.838 --> 12:36.255
Police. Open up.

12:41.461 --> 12:42.962
Hands up! Hands up!
Drop the bat!

12:42.964 --> 12:43.963
Hands where we
can see them!

12:43.965 --> 12:45.714
Hands up!
Drop the bat!

12:45.716 --> 12:47.600
Whoa. What the...?

13:04.443 --> 13:06.104
So, you're just...
you're just moving out?

13:06.105 --> 13:08.338
Larry, we have a
practice together.

13:08.340 --> 13:10.374
Practices split up.

13:10.376 --> 13:13.159
I'll give you a call next week
to work out the details.

13:13.161 --> 13:14.778
If this is about
this whole

13:14.780 --> 13:16.963
grand jury thing,
it's-it's crap.

13:16.965 --> 13:18.799
I'm innocent.
And I'm gone.

13:18.801 --> 13:20.017
Good-bye, Bill.

13:20.019 --> 13:21.935
Dr. Greenfield.

13:21.937 --> 13:24.221
Sorry to interrupt
your little quarrel there.

13:24.223 --> 13:25.355
What do you want?

13:25.357 --> 13:26.857
I want to know where
you were last night

13:26.859 --> 13:28.225
when somebody tried
to kill Vance Bradley.

13:28.227 --> 13:30.310
You can't think that was me.

13:30.312 --> 13:32.763
Well, actually, I can think
whatever I want to, Doctor.

13:32.765 --> 13:34.431
Look, I'm a physician.

13:34.433 --> 13:35.782
Okay, I save lives.

13:35.784 --> 13:37.734
Not according to
the DA's office.

13:37.736 --> 13:39.703
And not according to the
family of Becca Reynolds.

13:39.705 --> 13:41.288
You remember who
she is-- young girl

13:41.290 --> 13:43.857
who OD'd with prescription
narcotics from your inventory?

13:43.859 --> 13:46.693
Look, that was a glitch
in our dispensing system.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.027
Listen,
if you're just here

13:48.029 --> 13:49.863
to parrot the same
line of crap

13:49.865 --> 13:51.214
that Vance
has been peddling...

13:51.216 --> 13:52.532
If Vance is peddling
a line of crap,

13:52.534 --> 13:54.367
why are you trying to get
him to not take the stand?

13:54.369 --> 13:56.053
Vance is a leech.

13:56.055 --> 13:57.754
I mean, it's...
it's sad, actually.

13:57.756 --> 14:01.040
But if he wants to smear me,
I got plenty to smear him.

14:01.042 --> 14:03.093
The drug use, the...
the way he treats women.

14:03.095 --> 14:05.062
Where were you
last night at 9:30?

14:05.897 --> 14:07.397
Le Beau Monde.

14:07.399 --> 14:08.882
Having supper.

14:08.884 --> 14:11.217
Oh. Were you at a table
for one in the back

14:11.219 --> 14:12.519
where no one could see you?

14:12.521 --> 14:16.573
Table for two, up front,
with my attorney.

14:16.575 --> 14:18.558
Talk to him.
I will.

14:18.560 --> 14:20.393
Talk to the waitress.
I'll do that, too.

14:20.395 --> 14:21.561
And talk
to the maître d'

14:21.563 --> 14:23.580
who was so terrified of me
he could barely ask

14:23.582 --> 14:25.248
for a referral for his
mother's back surgery.

14:25.250 --> 14:27.701
I'll be sure
to do that, too, Doctor.

14:27.703 --> 14:31.088
You guys sure know how
to keep your hands clean.

14:34.926 --> 14:36.843
Officer, come on.
It's only weed.

14:36.845 --> 14:38.879
That's almost
legal these days.

14:38.881 --> 14:42.048
Yeah, and you're almost
not going to jail.

14:44.302 --> 14:45.802
Let me guess, Cruz.

14:45.804 --> 14:47.304
Not one of them
is Justin.

14:47.306 --> 14:49.055
Maybe Holly got
the address wrong.

14:49.057 --> 14:50.891
Or maybe she set us up.

14:50.893 --> 14:52.726
Reagan, Cruz.

14:52.728 --> 14:54.277
That's a good arrest.

14:54.279 --> 14:56.196
Yeah, wish we could
say we planned it.

14:56.198 --> 14:58.315
We got sent here
by a woman, Sarge,

14:58.317 --> 15:00.567
uh, looking for her son
who may not even exist.

15:00.569 --> 15:01.985
Sure would like
to run with this,

15:01.987 --> 15:03.620
track her down
and get some real answers.

15:03.622 --> 15:05.489
You bucking
for detective now, Reagan?

15:05.491 --> 15:06.456
More to the story, Sarge.

15:06.458 --> 15:08.074
Just like to find out
what it is.

15:09.160 --> 15:10.544
All right.

15:10.546 --> 15:11.878
Keep me in the loop.

15:11.880 --> 15:14.080
Ten-four.

15:21.455 --> 15:23.807
Vacant building
on that street?

15:23.809 --> 15:26.125
Where the hell
are we going?

15:26.127 --> 15:28.628
You do realize you should
be home right now.

15:28.630 --> 15:30.096
I'll be home soon enough.

15:30.098 --> 15:32.649
After I get more
Pierre Du Fait.

15:32.651 --> 15:35.936
My vintner is holding
several cases for me.

15:35.938 --> 15:37.487
Should be enough
to weather this little...

15:37.489 --> 15:39.022
this little lockdown.

15:39.024 --> 15:41.658
You do remember almost being
pasted by a car last night.

15:41.660 --> 15:45.495
Hey, you need your gun
to do your job.

15:45.497 --> 15:47.480
Those of us who make art,

15:47.482 --> 15:49.366
we have needs
of our own.

15:49.368 --> 15:50.951
Maybe mine's not the sanest way

15:50.953 --> 15:54.037
of accessing my muse,
but whatever.

15:54.039 --> 15:55.956
Marvin...

15:55.958 --> 15:57.541
would you do me
a favor and find

15:57.543 --> 15:58.675
an alternate route, please?

15:58.677 --> 16:00.227
Try taking Madison, okay?

16:01.462 --> 16:03.329
In case somebody happens
to know where we're going.

16:03.331 --> 16:04.831
Which, with your habit,
I'm sure it

16:04.833 --> 16:06.216
wouldn't be hard to figure out.

16:09.020 --> 16:11.221
You know my driver's name?

16:11.223 --> 16:13.023
Yeah. What, you think
I'm going to let some guy

16:13.025 --> 16:14.891
get behind the wheel
of a car that I'm in

16:14.893 --> 16:16.059
without doing
a background check first?

16:16.061 --> 16:18.562
So I guess Marvin checks out.

16:18.564 --> 16:19.846
He's driving the car, isn't he?

16:19.848 --> 16:21.731
Are you adopted?

16:21.733 --> 16:25.569
Because Erin
is positively lovely.

16:32.243 --> 16:33.627
Holly?

16:33.629 --> 16:35.161
I don't have any tenants
named Holly.

16:35.163 --> 16:38.248
Late 20s, kind of cute
in a hippy chick sort of way.

16:38.250 --> 16:40.717
That could be any girl
in this neighborhood.

16:40.719 --> 16:42.886
She was selling jewelry
right out front.

16:42.888 --> 16:45.388
Now, that sounds like Rhonda.

16:45.390 --> 16:46.873
So she does live
in this building?

16:46.875 --> 16:49.843
No, but I keep having
to run her off.

16:49.845 --> 16:52.395
I don't need any of
her reefer smoke

16:52.397 --> 16:54.097
stinking up my building.

16:54.099 --> 16:55.381
Rhonda was smoking pot?

16:55.383 --> 16:58.518
Lot of her customers
looked like they do, too.

16:58.520 --> 17:00.103
Now, that's
all I know.

17:00.105 --> 17:01.888
Can I finish
my sweeping?

17:01.890 --> 17:03.940
Yeah. Thank you
for your time, ma'am.

17:06.109 --> 17:08.227
So, Rhonda, Holly,
whatever her name is,

17:08.229 --> 17:11.330
sends us to the stash house
and she smokes pot herself?

17:11.333 --> 17:13.383
Sensing a pattern here?
You don't know that.

17:13.385 --> 17:15.401
Don't tell me you're still
trying to ask this girl out.

17:15.403 --> 17:16.736
I'm just not
going to convict her

17:16.738 --> 17:18.237
till we get her side
of the story.

17:18.239 --> 17:19.839
Now, we canvass
the neighborhood

17:19.840 --> 17:21.508
and we'll see
if anybody else knows her.

17:22.343 --> 17:23.926
Or we I.D. her ourselves.

17:23.929 --> 17:25.211
If we can pull
her fingerprint

17:25.213 --> 17:26.846
off that necklace
that she gave you.

17:26.848 --> 17:29.099
Right.

17:53.607 --> 17:55.158
What's this?

17:55.160 --> 17:56.576
Your favorite.

17:56.578 --> 17:58.979
Pastrami from the Woodrow Diner.

18:00.364 --> 18:02.766
Beware of Greeks bearing gifts.

18:15.980 --> 18:18.131
I shouldn't
have raised my voice.

18:18.133 --> 18:19.949
No, you shouldn't have.

18:19.951 --> 18:21.301
I was out of line.

18:21.303 --> 18:23.603
Yes, you were.

18:23.605 --> 18:25.672
And I'm sorry.

18:25.674 --> 18:27.157
No, you're not.

18:27.159 --> 18:28.942
I sure am.

18:28.944 --> 18:31.461
So you think I'm fine to drive?

18:36.200 --> 18:38.535
I didn't say that.

18:39.837 --> 18:42.756
Well, it's what you should say.

18:43.657 --> 18:45.258
What's this?

18:45.260 --> 18:48.128
A police report
filed by the young lady

18:48.130 --> 18:50.530
who banged into me
in the parking lot.

18:53.884 --> 18:55.835
She filed a report?

18:55.837 --> 18:57.103
Yeah.

18:57.105 --> 18:59.889
She was late for class,
but she jotted down my license

18:59.891 --> 19:02.308
and filed it
this morning at the 8-6.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.195
That's good to hear.

19:12.536 --> 19:15.622
Pop...

19:15.624 --> 19:19.993
just consider this.

19:19.995 --> 19:21.745
There's been other times

19:21.747 --> 19:25.665
and who knows how many
other near misses.

19:27.134 --> 19:28.918
I'm just saying...

19:28.920 --> 19:31.554
Francis...

19:31.556 --> 19:36.176
you're a terrific father
and a hell of a boss,

19:36.178 --> 19:41.231
but you're neither one
of those things to me.

19:41.233 --> 19:45.168
I decide when it's time,
not you.

19:50.891 --> 19:52.776
All right, get him
his booze and let's go.

19:57.198 --> 19:58.531
Hey, babe.

19:58.533 --> 19:59.616
How's work?

19:59.618 --> 20:02.085
Well, I never actually
made it to work

20:02.087 --> 20:05.371
because, uh, the car
caught on fire, Danny.

20:05.373 --> 20:07.173
What?

20:07.175 --> 20:08.875
Yeah, I think that weird noise,
it was...

20:08.877 --> 20:10.460
it must have been
something electrical

20:10.462 --> 20:12.262
because the dashboard...

20:12.264 --> 20:16.132
it started smoking, and then...
then the whole thing just...

20:16.134 --> 20:17.383
it went up in flames.

20:17.385 --> 20:18.468
Are you okay?

20:18.470 --> 20:19.886
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

20:19.888 --> 20:21.771
But the car's a goner.

20:21.773 --> 20:25.058
I-I'm so sorry
I didn't take care of it.

20:25.060 --> 20:26.726
What are we going to do, Danny?

20:26.728 --> 20:29.195
I don't know. I told you
I'll figure something out.

20:29.197 --> 20:31.097
We got two kids,
we got two jobs.

20:31.099 --> 20:32.532
We need two cars.

20:32.534 --> 20:33.817
Yeah, I know that, honey,

20:33.819 --> 20:35.985
but I can't pull money
out of the air, okay?

20:35.987 --> 20:37.537
I said I'm working on it.

20:37.539 --> 20:39.906
I know.

20:39.908 --> 20:43.827
I got to get...
I got to go, okay?

20:51.218 --> 20:52.852
Vance, get down!

20:54.054 --> 20:55.288
Watch it!

21:03.597 --> 21:05.899
Hey, you all right?
Come on.

21:05.901 --> 21:07.901
Sit up. Sit up.
You hit?

21:07.903 --> 21:09.152
No.

21:09.154 --> 21:10.403
Okay. All right.

21:10.405 --> 21:12.238
How the hell did they find us?

21:12.240 --> 21:13.990
I don't know.

21:18.162 --> 21:19.979
Son of a bitch.

21:21.148 --> 21:22.415
GPS.

21:22.417 --> 21:24.334
Whoever Dr. Greenfield
hired to kill you

21:24.336 --> 21:26.669
is not going to be
giving up any time soon.

21:35.600 --> 21:36.900
He looks pretty shaken up.

21:36.902 --> 21:38.819
Good. Maybe he'll
smarten up finally.

21:38.821 --> 21:40.854
You got anything
on the motorcycle yet?

21:40.856 --> 21:42.673
Yeah, patrol already
found it-- they said it was

21:42.675 --> 21:44.708
dumped and wiped clean
just like the car was.

21:44.710 --> 21:46.326
Of course, none of this
would have happened

21:46.328 --> 21:48.512
if you'd kept Vance
off the street like I had asked.

21:48.514 --> 21:49.747
I tried to.

21:49.749 --> 21:51.048
The guy's like a two-year-old.

21:51.050 --> 21:52.149
Look at him.

21:52.151 --> 21:53.851
Tells me I'm not
the boss of him.

21:53.853 --> 21:57.904
Danny, I need him at the
grand jury Monday morning alive.

21:58.923 --> 22:00.190
Can you get him home
and keep him there?

22:00.192 --> 22:01.625
Yes, I will, okay?

22:01.627 --> 22:03.343
Thanks for coming by, sis.

22:04.629 --> 22:06.180
Vance, let's go.

22:16.757 --> 22:18.225
Welcome home,
Mr. Bradley.

22:18.227 --> 22:20.027
Everything okay?
Everything's great.

22:20.029 --> 22:22.196
Stand in the corner, please.

22:25.533 --> 22:27.317
How do you do it, Reagan?

22:27.319 --> 22:29.936
Do what,
be such a snazzy dresser?

22:29.938 --> 22:32.156
Jump in front of bullets.

22:32.158 --> 22:34.458
Save the lives of people
you've barely met.

22:34.460 --> 22:36.126
It's my job, okay?

22:36.128 --> 22:38.245
I'm still trying to figure out
how you do it,

22:38.247 --> 22:39.663
ending up
on somebody's hit list.

22:39.665 --> 22:41.215
That's just it.

22:41.217 --> 22:44.117
They didn't get me
because of you.

22:44.119 --> 22:45.619
All right, look,
if you're thinking

22:45.621 --> 22:47.387
about hugging me, don't, please.

22:47.389 --> 22:50.474
Still got two days before you're
safe and out of the woods.

22:50.476 --> 22:51.909
And even then, don't hug me.

22:55.563 --> 22:57.731
Okay. All right.

23:13.314 --> 23:14.915
Hi, Danny. What's up?

23:14.917 --> 23:17.184
Hey, honey.

23:17.186 --> 23:18.785
Look, I wanted to apologize.

23:18.787 --> 23:21.004
I was out of line earlier, okay?

23:21.006 --> 23:23.090
I'm fine, Danny.

23:23.092 --> 23:25.275
Really, I'm fine.

23:25.277 --> 23:26.426
Okay.

23:26.428 --> 23:28.161
Well, I was also thinking

23:28.163 --> 23:31.381
maybe I could pick up
a few extra tours when I can.

23:31.383 --> 23:32.950
You know, nights, weekends.

23:32.952 --> 23:34.451
What, and never see the kids?

23:34.453 --> 23:37.054
Only until I can get you
in a car, honey.

23:37.056 --> 23:38.972
Don't the, uh, Trevinos
down the street

23:38.974 --> 23:41.275
got a, uh, old station wagon
in the garage?

23:41.277 --> 23:43.777
Maybe we could steal it
from them for a few days.

23:44.979 --> 23:46.530
Yeah, that's a good idea.

23:46.532 --> 23:48.565
I'm going to call them
in the morning.

23:48.567 --> 23:49.733
All three.

23:49.735 --> 23:50.850
All right.

23:52.471 --> 23:53.687
Alarm just went off.

23:53.689 --> 23:54.955
Danny, you expecting someone?

23:54.957 --> 23:56.790
Not anybody friendly.
I got to go.

24:05.617 --> 24:07.134
Hey!

24:07.136 --> 24:08.335
Who the hell are you?
Vance!

24:08.337 --> 24:10.053
I said, "Who the hell are you""
Vance!

24:10.055 --> 24:11.538
Wait, wait, wait.
Reagan.

24:11.540 --> 24:14.141
Vance!
Reagan, I know her.

24:14.143 --> 24:16.927
Baby, are you all right?

24:18.162 --> 24:19.930
Her name is Lizzy Hughes.

24:19.932 --> 24:21.148
She's my wife.

24:21.150 --> 24:23.233
Yeah, I thought you said
she was out of town.

24:23.235 --> 24:24.651
She was supposed
to be in Berlin.

24:24.653 --> 24:25.986
Baby, why are
you home?

24:25.988 --> 24:27.387
I got lonely.

24:27.389 --> 24:29.222
Today, I just...
I thought I'd...

24:29.224 --> 24:31.491
fly back early
and surprise you.

24:32.827 --> 24:34.194
What-what happened to you?

24:34.196 --> 24:35.779
Uh, it's...
it's a long story.

24:35.781 --> 24:37.281
Come on. I'll tell you.

24:49.827 --> 24:51.595
Another day,
another dollar, huh, Rhonda?

24:51.597 --> 24:53.931
Uh, hi, but it's Holly.

24:53.933 --> 24:56.383
It's Rhonda... Lynne Watson.

24:56.385 --> 24:57.884
Formerly at Rikers Island.

24:57.886 --> 24:59.720
Two counts possession
and sale of marijuana.

24:59.722 --> 25:01.805
Why don't you show us
what you really got

25:01.807 --> 25:03.523
inside that little
jewelry box?

25:13.451 --> 25:15.085
Still up to your old tricks.

25:15.087 --> 25:16.653
Please, let me explain.

25:16.655 --> 25:17.738
Explain what?

25:17.740 --> 25:19.206
You batted your eyes,

25:19.208 --> 25:21.107
you played the cute
little hippy chick.

25:21.109 --> 25:22.409
Yeah, told us that sob story

25:22.411 --> 25:24.378
about your imaginary son
so we could clear out

25:24.380 --> 25:25.545
the neighborhood
competition for you.

25:25.547 --> 25:27.798
Okay, I did that--
I was wrong--

25:27.800 --> 25:30.417
but I really do have
a son named Justin.

25:30.419 --> 25:33.220
Right, and he rides a magic
unicorn across the sky.

25:33.222 --> 25:34.771
Come on, hands behind your back.
No, no, no.

25:34.796 --> 25:35.607
You're under arrest.

25:35.608 --> 25:37.123
I'm sorry.

25:37.125 --> 25:40.627
You realize that you two
fight more than me and Mom.

25:40.629 --> 25:44.031
That's because your mother's not
thickheaded like her father.

25:44.033 --> 25:45.749
Have you met my mother?

25:45.751 --> 25:47.901
Okay, maybe she is.

25:47.903 --> 25:49.969
A little.
Or a lot.

25:49.971 --> 25:52.522
It's not just that he's thick.

25:52.524 --> 25:54.257
It's that he won't listen
to reason.

25:54.259 --> 25:55.742
I hear that's hereditary.

25:55.744 --> 25:57.969
Well, just don't forget
whose rib you came from.

25:57.994 --> 25:58.746
Mom's.

25:58.747 --> 26:00.914
<i>He's been like this</i>
<i>since he's a boy.</i>

26:00.916 --> 26:02.582
When he was four years old,

26:02.584 --> 26:05.636
he named himself
superintendent of the sandbox.

26:05.638 --> 26:07.337
I think what you should
do right now

26:07.339 --> 26:08.922
is just talk to him.

26:08.924 --> 26:10.757
Share your feelings
with him.

26:10.759 --> 26:12.909
He knows my feelings.

26:12.911 --> 26:14.344
I don't know why
I just don't

26:14.346 --> 26:16.079
take the keys
and pull the plates

26:16.081 --> 26:18.098
off the car myself.
You can't do that.

26:18.100 --> 26:19.182
Why not?

26:19.184 --> 26:21.601
Because it's my car
and it's my life.

26:21.603 --> 26:24.671
That's exactly
what I say to my mom.

26:24.673 --> 26:26.590
Does she listen?

26:26.592 --> 26:27.974
Never.

26:29.143 --> 26:31.511
But sometimes
it does feel good

26:31.513 --> 26:33.530
to get things off your chest.

26:33.532 --> 26:35.949
Sorry, but I like
to keep things

26:35.951 --> 26:38.035
on my chest where
they belong.

26:38.037 --> 26:39.786
Pass the salt, please.

26:39.788 --> 26:41.521
<i>Be the bigger person.</i>

26:41.523 --> 26:42.506
Go talk to him.

26:42.508 --> 26:45.191
I already did-- twice.

26:45.193 --> 26:47.193
He won't listen to me.

26:48.246 --> 26:50.530
Well, someone needs
to talk to him.

26:51.365 --> 26:53.216
Yes, they do.

26:55.420 --> 26:57.654
No. No, I'm...

26:57.656 --> 26:59.806
Sweetie, he listens to you.

26:59.808 --> 27:01.508
About what tie to wear
with what suit

27:01.510 --> 27:03.209
or what to get the kids
for Christmas.

27:03.211 --> 27:04.227
Not about this.

27:04.229 --> 27:06.680
He's your only grandfather.

27:07.515 --> 27:08.598
Guilt?

27:08.600 --> 27:10.183
That's what this has come to?

27:20.578 --> 27:22.412
I'll think about it.

27:31.239 --> 27:32.539
Hey.

27:32.541 --> 27:34.224
Thought I told you
to stay inside.

27:34.226 --> 27:35.726
You're exposed
out here.

27:35.728 --> 27:38.378
I was going
stir-crazy in there.

27:39.363 --> 27:41.198
Don't you think you had
enough of that already?

27:41.200 --> 27:43.467
That's your
fourth glass since lunch.

27:43.469 --> 27:45.769
Just...

27:46.554 --> 27:47.921
All right.

27:48.856 --> 27:51.024
I'll be inside.

27:52.276 --> 27:54.277
You should work for me, Reagan.

27:54.279 --> 27:55.879
Thought I was.

27:57.782 --> 27:58.949
Permanently.

27:58.951 --> 28:00.250
Security consultant.

28:00.252 --> 28:02.669
You shoot photos, Vance.

28:02.671 --> 28:04.905
And I get paid a
hell of a lot for it.

28:04.907 --> 28:07.457
What I got in my wallet could
run a third-world country.

28:07.459 --> 28:09.326
Plus, now I fund charities.

28:09.328 --> 28:11.378
Philanthropic projects
all around the world.

28:11.380 --> 28:12.829
Come on.

28:12.831 --> 28:14.881
Look, I'm not the smartest
guy in the world,

28:14.883 --> 28:17.617
but I'm smart enough to
see that you have skills

28:17.619 --> 28:20.137
and a strength that I don't.

28:21.105 --> 28:22.956
I mean, you're a
pain in the ass...

28:24.258 --> 28:25.892
...but I think we
could have fun.

28:27.395 --> 28:29.196
Thanks, but I got a job already.

28:29.198 --> 28:31.464
Whatever the NYPD pays
you, I'll triple it.

28:31.466 --> 28:32.966
That's not what
I'm talking about.

28:32.968 --> 28:34.300
I'll quadruple it.

28:34.302 --> 28:35.819
Health and pension, too.

28:36.704 --> 28:38.071
I got a family, Vance.

28:38.073 --> 28:40.774
And I've got an
Embraer Phenom.

28:40.776 --> 28:42.659
Flies 500 miles an hour.

28:42.661 --> 28:44.494
Wherever we go,
I'll get you back

28:44.496 --> 28:47.414
to your family
in no time.

29:01.546 --> 29:05.849
Nicky, tell your grandpa
to pass the salt.

29:08.135 --> 29:11.304
Grandpa, can you pass
the salt, please?

29:16.861 --> 29:19.679
Played your heart out at that
game this morning, Jack.

29:19.681 --> 29:22.232
Yeah, and that's
just as important as winning.

29:22.234 --> 29:24.301
Yeah, it was
a tough loss, kiddo.

29:24.303 --> 29:26.403
No such thing as
an easy loss, right, Dad?

29:26.405 --> 29:27.704
Yeah, you got
that right, kid.

29:27.706 --> 29:29.539
But this loss is on me.

29:29.541 --> 29:31.658
I haven't practiced
with you in days. Sorry.

29:31.660 --> 29:34.077
Actually, I think
it's my fault, Jack.

29:34.079 --> 29:36.329
I asked your dad
to help me out this week.

29:36.331 --> 29:38.965
I told her our
situation.

29:38.967 --> 29:40.717
You're pregnant?

29:40.719 --> 29:41.968
What?

29:42.820 --> 29:43.954
Grandpa!

29:43.956 --> 29:45.939
We're having a baby?
Yes!

29:45.941 --> 29:48.008
Yes!
No. No.

29:48.010 --> 29:51.544
In my day, that's what
we called a situation.

29:52.713 --> 29:54.848
Nobody's having a baby.

29:54.850 --> 29:57.400
Doing a little
moonlighting on the side.

29:57.402 --> 29:58.718
What's moonlighting?

29:58.720 --> 30:00.153
It's when you do a little

30:00.155 --> 30:02.572
extra work on the side
for money.

30:02.574 --> 30:04.174
We need extra money?

30:04.176 --> 30:05.325
Hey.

30:05.327 --> 30:07.110
I hear somebody's birthday
is coming up.

30:07.112 --> 30:08.278
Yes.
Oh, yeah, Jack.

30:08.280 --> 30:10.497
- Oh, yeah.
- Right.

30:10.499 --> 30:12.082
Everything's going
to be fine, okay?

30:12.084 --> 30:14.501
It's all under
control, everybody.

30:15.336 --> 30:16.903
You've got something
on your mind.

30:18.005 --> 30:19.789
Yeah, I do have something
on my mind.

30:19.791 --> 30:22.926
This guy, Vance, who Erin
got me this gig with,

30:22.928 --> 30:24.878
he offered me a job.

30:24.880 --> 30:26.863
What?
Get out.

30:26.865 --> 30:28.465
I don't like the sound of this.

30:28.467 --> 30:30.249
Pop...
Pop what?

30:31.235 --> 30:32.352
What kind of job?

30:32.354 --> 30:33.770
The kind of job
that pays me

30:33.772 --> 30:35.438
four times more
than what I earn now.

30:35.440 --> 30:36.606
Wow.

30:36.608 --> 30:38.475
Nice, Uncle Danny.

30:38.477 --> 30:40.259
Yeah, it is nice.

30:40.261 --> 30:41.695
Very nice.

30:41.697 --> 30:42.762
Wait a second.

30:42.764 --> 30:44.731
Yeah, are you actually
thinking about this?

30:44.733 --> 30:46.733
We're just...
we're considering it.

30:46.735 --> 30:49.536
I mean, right,
I'd be an idiot not to, right?

30:51.289 --> 30:54.074
So be an idiot-- a happy idiot.

30:54.076 --> 30:56.326
What are you talking
about here, Danny?

30:56.328 --> 30:59.079
I'm just saying, maybe it's
the right thing to do.

30:59.081 --> 31:01.581
I mean, it'll take care
of all of our money problems.

31:01.583 --> 31:02.916
Right, honey?

31:05.619 --> 31:07.453
Frank?

31:09.123 --> 31:10.590
It's your decision, son.

31:10.592 --> 31:12.392
Damn straight.

31:20.102 --> 31:22.268
That was fun.
Mmm.

31:23.888 --> 31:26.139
So, now that your whole
family's weighed in

31:26.141 --> 31:28.307
on this job offer,
where are you at?

31:28.309 --> 31:31.077
Isn't it obvious?

31:36.334 --> 31:38.351
What is it, Vance?

31:38.353 --> 31:40.837
Something's wrong with the cop
who's filling in for you.

31:40.839 --> 31:42.706
What do you mean, wrong?
Wrong how?

31:42.708 --> 31:44.490
Well, he's... he's passed out.

31:44.492 --> 31:46.109
Like he's drugged.

31:46.111 --> 31:47.460
Did he eat or drink anything?

31:47.462 --> 31:48.995
Well, I don't know.

31:48.997 --> 31:51.264
Lizzy gave him
some orange juice, but...

31:51.266 --> 31:52.498
Where's Lizzy now?

31:52.500 --> 31:54.100
She's at dinner
with an art dealer.

31:54.102 --> 31:55.635
She left about ten minutes ago.

31:55.637 --> 31:56.970
All right, Vance,
listen to me.

31:56.972 --> 31:58.672
You're going to take
Jenkins' gun,

31:58.674 --> 31:59.773
and you're going
to hold on to it.

31:59.775 --> 32:00.907
There's a round
in the chamber,

32:00.909 --> 32:02.508
but do not put your finger
on the trigger,

32:02.510 --> 32:04.194
but if anybody comes
through that door besides me,

32:04.196 --> 32:05.228
you shoot, you understand?

32:05.230 --> 32:06.596
Reagan, what's going on?

32:06.598 --> 32:08.064
I'm on my way.

32:08.066 --> 32:09.983
Everything okay?
No.

32:09.985 --> 32:12.185
Far from it.

32:25.969 --> 32:28.303
Hey. Anybody go up
to Vance's apartment tonight?

32:28.305 --> 32:30.505
Repairman just went up.
Mr. Bradley's wife called

32:30.507 --> 32:32.124
and said the
dishwasher's broken.

32:32.126 --> 32:33.124
All right, a bunch of cops

32:33.126 --> 32:34.459
are about to come
through that door.

32:34.461 --> 32:36.127
When they do,
you send them right up.

33:04.340 --> 33:06.591
Why don't you lower that gun,
Vance, okay?

33:08.294 --> 33:09.994
Put the gun down.

33:15.334 --> 33:17.836
It worked.

33:17.838 --> 33:19.170
Just like you said.

33:19.172 --> 33:21.023
Yeah, it did.

33:22.859 --> 33:25.694
I never killed anybody.

33:25.696 --> 33:26.978
It's all right.

33:26.980 --> 33:27.979
You did good.

33:27.981 --> 33:30.181
He walked right in.

33:33.319 --> 33:34.820
He knew the code.

33:34.822 --> 33:36.905
Yeah.

33:36.907 --> 33:40.125
Now I got to go find the woman
who gave it to him.

34:01.882 --> 34:03.515
I still can't
believe it.

34:03.517 --> 34:04.733
Well, believe it.

34:04.735 --> 34:05.984
She spilled everything--

34:05.986 --> 34:08.904
how she hired the hit man,
how she panicked and flew back

34:08.906 --> 34:10.489
when the car didn't kill you.

34:10.491 --> 34:12.074
But she's my wife.

34:12.076 --> 34:13.391
Yeah, well,

34:13.393 --> 34:15.226
you started giving all your
millions away like Santa Claus.

34:15.228 --> 34:16.610
I don't think
she liked it too much.

34:16.612 --> 34:19.831
Don't take it personal,
but it's not the first time

34:19.833 --> 34:22.167
I saw somebody lose
their mind over money.

34:22.168 --> 34:23.518
Why don't you have a seat.

34:23.520 --> 34:25.786
I got to take
your statement.

34:29.376 --> 34:31.074
Look, Vance,

34:31.077 --> 34:32.793
you're not the bad
guy here, okay?

34:32.795 --> 34:36.764
Your testimony got a grand jury
indictment on Greenfield,

34:36.766 --> 34:39.250
and I got two collars today,
thanks to you.

34:39.252 --> 34:41.103
You're making me
look like a rock star.

34:41.105 --> 34:43.355
I just don't know
how I could be so blind.

34:43.357 --> 34:46.056
That's what they say love is.

34:54.650 --> 34:57.268
All the more reason
I want you watching my back.

34:57.270 --> 34:59.538
Reagan,

34:59.540 --> 35:01.706
work for me.

35:01.708 --> 35:04.659
As a matter of fact,
I'm doing Saint Bart's tomorrow.

35:04.661 --> 35:06.328
I'll fire up the jet,
you pack your bags,

35:06.330 --> 35:09.131
we'll be on our way.

35:09.133 --> 35:10.849
Saint Bart's, huh?

35:15.221 --> 35:18.473
I really, really appreciate
the offer, Vance,

35:18.475 --> 35:21.560
but there's a hundred cops
who can do that job.

35:21.562 --> 35:23.595
I belong here doing this one.

35:25.598 --> 35:26.848
Come on.

35:26.850 --> 35:28.483
I taught you
how to shoot, anyway;

35:28.485 --> 35:30.018
that's half the job right there.

35:38.060 --> 35:39.477
Hi, Grandpa.

35:39.479 --> 35:41.663
Hi, beautiful.

35:45.418 --> 35:46.401
Where's Dad?

35:46.403 --> 35:48.620
Where's who?

35:50.456 --> 35:52.541
Can you come with me, please?

36:02.435 --> 36:04.603
Dad?

36:04.605 --> 36:06.504
Sweetheart.

36:07.874 --> 36:09.891
I'll let you two catch up.

36:09.893 --> 36:12.110
No. We need to talk.

36:12.112 --> 36:13.144
I have nothing to say.

36:13.146 --> 36:15.013
Wait.

36:15.015 --> 36:17.682
Before you say anything,
hear me out.

36:30.863 --> 36:35.300
Grandpa... ever since
you put a ring

36:35.302 --> 36:38.603
on Grandma's finger, you have
watched over this family

36:38.605 --> 36:39.955
with unconditional love

36:39.957 --> 36:42.674
and unwavering devotion.

36:42.676 --> 36:46.261
You gave each and every one
of us the freedom

36:46.263 --> 36:48.246
to find our own way in the world

36:48.248 --> 36:51.383
and the room for us
to make our own mistakes,

36:51.385 --> 36:57.155
and you were there to catch us
before we fell too hard.

36:58.424 --> 37:03.227
We are who we are today
because of you.

37:03.229 --> 37:05.196
We learned from the best.

37:06.732 --> 37:12.003
And you taught us that
loving someone sometimes means

37:12.005 --> 37:15.406
asking them to do
what they think is impossible.

37:24.467 --> 37:27.519
Pop...

37:27.521 --> 37:29.170
you're my Mickey Mantle.

37:31.307 --> 37:34.025
So the last thing
in the world I want to do

37:34.027 --> 37:36.728
is say you've lost a step.

37:42.601 --> 37:45.403
But I love you,

37:45.405 --> 37:48.640
and I want to have you around
for a long time.

37:51.460 --> 37:54.879
So, I'm asking...

37:54.881 --> 37:57.849
would you please
give me your keys?

38:02.306 --> 38:03.755
I can't do that.

38:08.978 --> 38:11.062
Because I already
gave them to Linda.

38:12.014 --> 38:13.181
To Linda?

38:13.183 --> 38:14.232
And Danny.

38:14.234 --> 38:15.934
The keys, the pink slip,

38:15.936 --> 38:17.652
the whole shebang.

38:17.654 --> 38:19.404
Because their car blew up.

38:19.406 --> 38:21.606
That's exactly right.

38:23.492 --> 38:26.328
Well, no,
that's not entirely true.

38:29.082 --> 38:32.167
The truth is...

38:32.169 --> 38:35.787
Francis, there was never
a police report filed.

38:35.789 --> 38:39.040
Jimmy Conway

38:39.042 --> 38:40.458
is in the 86.

38:40.460 --> 38:41.926
He whipped that up for me.

38:41.928 --> 38:44.980
And I banged the bumper again
as I backed out of the garage.

38:49.552 --> 38:51.970
Is there any particular reason

38:51.972 --> 38:54.723
why you couldn't have
told us that when you came in?

38:54.725 --> 38:56.841
Didn't you hear her?
She told me not to say a word.

38:56.843 --> 38:59.194
Yeah, but you didn't mind
seeing us sweat a little.

38:59.196 --> 39:00.612
Damn straight.

39:00.614 --> 39:02.947
Deserve more than a little sweat.
Okay, just shut up!

39:03.899 --> 39:05.917
Both of you.

39:05.919 --> 39:10.238
Grandpa, give me a hug.

39:25.054 --> 39:26.921
Dad.
