00:23.656 --> 00:25.851
<i>Now I'd like to show you</i>
<i>how smart he is.</i>

00:25.959 --> 00:28.359
<i>Let's have some fun</i>
<i>and play Animal Quiz with Michael.</i>

00:28.461 --> 00:31.294
<i>Michael. Come on, Michael.</i>

00:31.398 --> 00:34.299
<i>You see what a good trainer I am.</i>
<i>Oh, there he comes.</i>

00:34.401 --> 00:35.663
<i>I got the wrong end.</i>

00:35.769 --> 00:38.397
<i>Goats are distinguished</i>
<i>by a narrow head,</i>

00:38.505 --> 00:43.238
<i>a bearded chin,</i>
<i>in the male, a short upturned tail.</i>

00:43.343 --> 00:46.506
<i>It's been called the "poor man's cow"</i>

00:46.613 --> 00:50.481
<i>because it yields</i>
<i>more milk for its size...</i>

00:50.583 --> 00:52.107
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

00:53.420 --> 00:54.580
<i>God.</i>

00:56.790 --> 00:57.984
<i>It's all right.</i>

00:58.091 --> 00:59.956
<i>Ostriches are a pretty funny bird.</i>

01:00.560 --> 01:03.188
<i>They can't fly but they like to dance.</i>

01:03.363 --> 01:06.992
<i>And they don't really bury their heads</i>
<i>in the sand</i>

01:07.100 --> 01:09.364
<i>but they do eat stones and shirts.</i>

01:09.469 --> 01:11.903
Look at my dad. He was the king.

01:12.005 --> 01:16.066
I mean, no matter what happened,
I mean, he was as cool as a cucumber.

01:16.176 --> 01:21.842
He never forgot a line.
And he never let anything ruffle him.

01:21.948 --> 01:24.178
My dad was the king.

01:24.284 --> 01:28.118
No doubt.
And his TV show ruled the ratings.

01:31.791 --> 01:33.418
What was that?

01:36.529 --> 01:37.689
Excuse me.

01:37.797 --> 01:41.392
It was a wildlife show
called <i>Strange Wilderness.</i>

01:41.501 --> 01:44.902
Yeah, you remember that?
Do you remember my dad?

01:45.004 --> 01:46.494
Oh, cool.

01:46.606 --> 01:49.541
Yeah, then he died
and then I took over the show,

01:49.642 --> 01:53.942
then it all went to hell and... I mean,
I'm nothing like my dad. Nothing at all.

01:55.381 --> 01:59.215
I don't know. I don't know
if it was like I wasn't bright enough or

01:59.319 --> 02:03.483
I didn't work hard enough or...
I used to smoke a lot of dope, so...

02:05.358 --> 02:08.156
No, I quit. Yeah, totally.

02:08.261 --> 02:10.024
What happened to the show?

02:10.130 --> 02:12.428
At first, it was great.

02:12.532 --> 02:16.024
I had a really good crew.
We were doing what we loved.

02:17.504 --> 02:18.801
But then...

02:22.308 --> 02:25.243
I don't know, things got a little strange.

02:45.365 --> 02:47.799
All right, people, we're losing light!

02:47.901 --> 02:52.770
We need animals on film.
We need animals on film now!

02:52.872 --> 02:56.569
Cooker! Look, I need the slinger tripod.
Break out the kreel.

02:56.676 --> 02:57.973
And I need a Mercury lens

02:58.077 --> 03:00.238
'cause I'm gonna reverse out
all the glass. Got it?

03:00.346 --> 03:01.506
Okay.

03:02.949 --> 03:05.383
It was a nice chat.

03:05.485 --> 03:08.283
- Talk to me, Milas. How we doing?
- We're doing fine.

03:08.388 --> 03:11.255
A couple of more minutes.
This damn thing's stuck again.

03:11.357 --> 03:15.760
Hang on, people. I am picking up
an underwater bubbling sound.

03:15.862 --> 03:19.559
I'm not sure what it is,
but, I mean, it is bubbling furiously.

03:19.666 --> 03:21.497
Junior, knock it off.

03:21.601 --> 03:23.899
All right, whatever it was, it's gone now.

03:24.003 --> 03:25.061
Pete?

03:26.139 --> 03:29.199
This is my nephew, the kid
I was telling you about, you know?

03:29.309 --> 03:31.971
He's a little green
and he sure loves his herb

03:32.078 --> 03:35.946
but around you guys,
when in Rome, huh?

03:36.049 --> 03:39.951
All right, well, hey, any nephew of Milas'
is a nephew of mine.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.384
Hey, welcome aboard.

03:41.487 --> 03:42.852
Don't! No.

03:43.623 --> 03:45.215
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

03:45.325 --> 03:47.520
It's not a good time for me right now.

03:47.627 --> 03:50.687
So, all right. Get into frame.
I think we're just about set.

03:50.797 --> 03:53.766
All righty. Be about right here.

03:53.866 --> 03:56.391
Fred, you got the stuff? Ready?

03:56.502 --> 03:58.402
- This is a bar napkin.
- Yeah.

03:58.504 --> 03:59.596
This is it?

03:59.706 --> 04:02.937
Our entire voice-over for our show
on bears is written on a cocktail napkin?

04:03.042 --> 04:05.943
Yeah, we wrote it last night
at P.J. Mahoney's.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.875
"Bears are large and brown."

04:09.983 --> 04:11.974
All right. Come on.

04:12.085 --> 04:15.316
Not all bears are large.
How about baby bears?

04:18.224 --> 04:21.853
"Bears derive their name
from a football team in Chicago."

04:23.563 --> 04:26.964
No. It's the other way around.

04:27.066 --> 04:29.193
Jesus Christ, Fred, come on.

04:29.936 --> 04:34.032
"It is estimated that bears kill
over two million salmon a year.

04:34.140 --> 04:37.541
"Attacks by salmon on bears
are much more rare."

04:40.680 --> 04:43.342
All right, that's gotta be true, right?
All right, let's go with that one.

04:43.449 --> 04:46.179
Let's get me standing here.
And on my count.

04:46.286 --> 04:50.916
Four, three, two, one, zero,
and I'm talking now.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.322
Yes, the bear is a fierce animal...

04:53.426 --> 04:56.122
I hear that weird bubbling sound again.

04:56.229 --> 04:57.491
It's not bubbling.

04:57.597 --> 04:59.997
Junior, I said knock it off.

05:00.099 --> 05:05.366
Okay, ready? Keep rolling.
Three, two, one, go.

05:05.471 --> 05:09.532
Yes, the bear is a fierce animal,
much more fierce than we know.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.873
It is estimated that bears kill
over two mill...

05:12.979 --> 05:14.844
We got fog rolling in, man.

05:14.947 --> 05:16.847
In a year.

05:16.949 --> 05:18.109
It's not fog.

05:18.217 --> 05:19.206
Milas, can you help me out here?

05:19.319 --> 05:21.787
For God's sake, Junior,
just set the bong down.

05:21.888 --> 05:23.185
Thanks.

05:23.289 --> 05:26.452
All right, let's go.
And three, two, one, go.

05:26.559 --> 05:30.620
Yes, the bear is a fierce animal,
much more fierce than we know.

05:30.730 --> 05:36.066
It is estimated that bears kill
over two million salmon a year,

05:36.169 --> 05:40.799
although attacks by salmon on bear
are much more fucking rare!

05:40.907 --> 05:41.874
Cut!

05:42.842 --> 05:46.005
<i>Gaulke, how many times</i>
<i>have we told you,</i>

05:46.112 --> 05:48.842
<i>you can't shoot without a permit?</i>

05:48.948 --> 05:51.940
<i>You've got a $500 fine coming.</i>

05:52.051 --> 05:54.849
<i>Now, pack up your stuff</i>
<i>and leave the forest.</i>

05:54.954 --> 05:57.616
<i>By the way, this is fire season.</i>

05:57.724 --> 06:02.024
<i>Smokey the Bear says,</i>
<i>"Put out the bong!"</i>

06:02.128 --> 06:05.120
Okay. Okay, thank you!

06:06.666 --> 06:09.863
Okay, let's take it from... Let's see...

06:09.969 --> 06:14.633
Let's see, from,
my time code says 08:40:22.

06:14.741 --> 06:18.734
We are cued <i>up. Strange Wilderness,</i>
episode 21, "Bear Elegance."

06:18.845 --> 06:20.472
We have sound speed now.

06:20.580 --> 06:24.573
Three, two, one, push the button, go.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.018
Bears are a proud people,

06:27.120 --> 06:30.715
although they're not people per se,
they're animals.

06:30.823 --> 06:35.260
Bears derived their name
from a football team in Chicago.

06:35.361 --> 06:37.625
Bears have been known to attack man,

06:37.730 --> 06:40.893
although the fact is that fewer people
have been killed by bears

06:41.000 --> 06:45.334
than in all of World War I
and World War II combined.

06:45.438 --> 06:48.305
Brown bears loves fishing...

06:48.408 --> 06:51.866
Brown... Brown bears bloves...

06:51.978 --> 06:54.173
God, why am I having so much trouble
saying "brown"?

06:54.280 --> 06:56.771
Maybe it's the two B's in "brown bears."
Try something different.

06:56.883 --> 06:58.874
I got it. I'm ready. Okay.

06:58.985 --> 07:00.646
Red bears love fish.

07:00.753 --> 07:03.745
Pete, you're late for your meeting
with Lawson down at K-PIP.

07:03.856 --> 07:06.586
Deb, we're in the middle
of a recording session,

07:06.692 --> 07:09.593
so every fucking thing you say
is going down on tape.

07:09.695 --> 07:13.096
Oh, right, like you guys ever care
about that crap?

07:13.199 --> 07:15.258
Okay, stop recording.

07:15.368 --> 07:17.495
Turn it...

07:17.603 --> 07:20.697
Turn off everything.
Put away, put away everything.

07:23.242 --> 07:26.905
Okay, everything's shut off.
Now, Deb, what's so important?

07:27.013 --> 07:28.241
Your meeting with Lawson

07:28.347 --> 07:32.579
was supposed to start 20 minutes ago,
you stupid asshole.

07:32.685 --> 07:33.709
Shit.

07:34.720 --> 07:38.554
Hey, fellas, I was bombed last night
at P.J. Maloney's.

07:38.658 --> 07:41.354
By the way, did you guys notice
any sediment in that tequila?

07:41.461 --> 07:45.261
'Cause some kind of pebble or rock
or something clogged up my penis hole

07:45.364 --> 07:46.661
and my Johnson swelled up

07:46.766 --> 07:50.224
like a fucking water balloon
hooked up to a tea kettle.

07:52.438 --> 07:54.668
Fuck you! You wanna fight?

07:54.774 --> 07:56.139
Here we are. Pull over.

07:56.642 --> 08:00.146
You guys better hustle up.
You're 45 minutes late for the meeting.

08:00.146 --> 08:00.441
You guys better hustle up.
You're 45 minutes late for the meeting.

08:03.983 --> 08:05.974
Great. I'll tell him you called. Thank you.

08:06.085 --> 08:09.418
Good morning. We have
an 11:00 meeting with Mr. Ed Lawson.

08:09.522 --> 08:10.716
Sorry we're a little late.

08:10.823 --> 08:12.654
Dude, Sky Pierson.

08:12.758 --> 08:14.157
Hey, Pierson, TJ.

08:14.260 --> 08:16.785
Well, as I live and breathe.

08:16.896 --> 08:19.660
Peter Gaulke
and his shadow, Fred Wolf.

08:19.765 --> 08:23.496
No, no, not Pete and Fred.
It's more like Neil and Bob.

08:23.603 --> 08:25.798
Or is that just what they do?

08:27.840 --> 08:29.501
Hey, so what are you guys doing here?

08:29.609 --> 08:33.409
We're talking to Lawson about bringing
our wildlife show over here to K-PIP.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.174
It's great, 'cause Lawson's in there

08:35.280 --> 08:37.909
jumping through hoops
trying to make the deal work.

08:38.017 --> 08:41.679
It is so much fun
to have your ass royally kissed.

08:41.787 --> 08:43.846
Yeah, it is.

08:43.956 --> 08:45.184
I mean, after all, it's not your fault

08:45.291 --> 08:48.727
that our budget
blows yours to kingdom come.

08:48.828 --> 08:52.559
And you must miss
your father's skills, am I right?

08:54.100 --> 08:55.965
Yeah.

08:56.068 --> 08:58.468
Yeah, actually it's...
Yes, just at times when I...

08:58.571 --> 09:01.404
You know what, we've got to go.
Later, huh?

09:01.507 --> 09:03.600
Seriously, good luck, dude.

09:04.844 --> 09:06.072
Awesome.

09:08.781 --> 09:14.083
You know, I know he was jiving us
a little, but Sky Pierson's so cool.

09:14.186 --> 09:15.312
Oh, yeah, you kidding me?

09:15.421 --> 09:18.356
He is the king
of wildlife show hosts, man.

09:18.457 --> 09:19.685
All right, come on, let's see Lawson.

09:19.792 --> 09:21.760
- This is it.
- Germans do it.

09:21.861 --> 09:23.556
All right, let's cut to the chase.

09:23.663 --> 09:25.688
The ratings for <i>Strange Wilderness</i>

09:25.798 --> 09:28.028
have been dropping considerably
for the past two years.

09:28.134 --> 09:32.901
Okay, now, when my dad had the show,
you aired him at 7:00

09:33.005 --> 09:35.030
and we're on at 3:00 a.m. So...

09:35.141 --> 09:39.737
Pete, let me finish.
I haven't even started yet. Okay?

09:39.845 --> 09:43.406
Let's take the crappy ratings aside.
Throw them aside.

09:43.516 --> 09:46.076
The network has taken so much flak

09:46.185 --> 09:49.052
for the perceived irresponsibility’s
of your show.

09:49.155 --> 09:51.146
I had my assistant
put together some clips.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.519
Oh, fun.

09:52.625 --> 09:57.028
Let me tell you something. I am
disturbed by what I'm seeing. Okay?

09:57.129 --> 10:01.828
<i>Many of these animals are... Whoa,</i>
<i>something's about to go down here.</i>

10:01.934 --> 10:06.166
<i>Oh, I can smell a good time</i>
<i>on the horizon. Oh, that's it.</i>

10:06.272 --> 10:11.300
<i>Slice me off a piece and serve it up hot.</i>
<i>I'm next in line.</i>

10:11.410 --> 10:12.604
Okay.

10:14.714 --> 10:16.181
That's okay, right?

10:16.282 --> 10:17.408
Sad.

10:17.516 --> 10:19.313
Okay? What about this?

10:21.187 --> 10:22.677
<i>Hey, stick around</i>

10:22.788 --> 10:26.747
<i>because when we come back, we're</i>
<i>gonna find us some pygmy people.</i>

10:31.030 --> 10:33.021
All right, all the littering aside,

10:33.132 --> 10:36.431
how do you refer
to the indigenous people, the natives,

10:36.535 --> 10:37.729
as pygmy people?

10:37.837 --> 10:38.929
That's just wrong!

10:39.038 --> 10:41.268
What? No.

10:41.374 --> 10:44.172
I like all people.

10:44.276 --> 10:46.335
It's Fred who's the racist.

10:46.445 --> 10:48.970
You ought to hear what he says
about the Chine.

10:49.081 --> 10:50.673
- Right?
- What?

10:50.783 --> 10:53.752
You are so not getting this, are you?
Take a look.

10:53.853 --> 10:55.218
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

11:02.595 --> 11:04.460
I mean, it's...

11:04.563 --> 11:08.124
Luckily we caught it on tape,
so that man will be honored.

11:08.234 --> 11:09.997
You wanted to honor the man

11:10.102 --> 11:14.129
by showing him being killed
by an alligator on your wildlife show?

11:16.008 --> 11:18.101
All right, what about this?

11:26.619 --> 11:29.417
A guy on fire at a peace rally.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.353
Did you guys ever think
of putting the cameras down

11:31.457 --> 11:32.719
and helping the guy out?

11:32.825 --> 11:36.386
And what was that music playing?
Some sort of Jesus music underneath?

11:36.495 --> 11:40.056
Was that at the rally
or did you add that? What was that?

11:41.200 --> 11:42.497
What about this?

11:51.677 --> 11:54.407
Now, what the hell is that?

11:54.513 --> 11:58.973
It's the African wilderness.
It's natives doing a war dance.

11:59.085 --> 12:00.382
That's not Africa.

12:00.486 --> 12:03.182
Right, well, not totally.

12:03.289 --> 12:07.555
See, a lot of the women of the bush,

12:07.660 --> 12:09.958
they're not really that good-looking.

12:10.062 --> 12:13.828
So, we got these girls instead.
They're from Long Beach.

12:13.933 --> 12:15.992
Stop talking. Please.

12:16.102 --> 12:17.194
You know, ever since your dad died,

12:17.303 --> 12:19.635
the quality of the show
has gone straight downhill.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.730
And now with the ratings in the toilet,

12:21.841 --> 12:24.639
there's no reason
to keep the show on the air. None.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.042
Unless something big happens.
I have no idea.

12:27.146 --> 12:30.343
Okay, wait. Now, something big.
Now, what do you mean by "big"?

12:30.449 --> 12:33.976
Well, why are we even discussing it?
Nothing big is going to happen.

12:34.086 --> 12:35.553
The show sucks.

12:35.654 --> 12:38.452
And I am officially, right now, telling you

12:38.557 --> 12:40.889
that two weeks from now
the show is cancelled.

12:40.993 --> 12:43.962
I've given you notice.
Thanks for coming in.

12:45.831 --> 12:47.458
All right.

12:47.566 --> 12:50.899
Think. We gotta think.
Okay, we're not cancelled yet.

12:51.003 --> 12:52.903
Cooker, go get us
a few quarts of coffee.

12:53.005 --> 12:54.165
This is gonna be a long night.

12:54.273 --> 12:58.369
Now, may I interject for a second
and say no, politely.

12:58.477 --> 13:01.344
What I'm trying to say is that
you drank coffee yesterday.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.347
You're gonna drink coffee tomorrow.

13:03.449 --> 13:06.941
The point is that
I'm not some great white stallion

13:07.052 --> 13:09.646
sprinting from shantytown
to shantytown,

13:09.755 --> 13:14.124
crushing up java beans
just to bring them around to my friends.

13:14.226 --> 13:15.193
Come on, we gotta think.

13:15.294 --> 13:18.957
We gotta come up with some big idea
that's gonna keep us on the air.

13:19.064 --> 13:21.464
Now, come on.
Hey, Junior, how 'bout you, fresh blood?

13:21.567 --> 13:23.228
You got any ideas?

13:24.336 --> 13:25.303
Yoo-hoo.

13:25.538 --> 13:26.732
Hey.

13:27.439 --> 13:29.805
- Hey. Hey.
- Shut up.

13:32.244 --> 13:33.939
What? Sorry.

13:34.046 --> 13:35.911
Dude, what is on your eyes?

13:36.015 --> 13:41.078
Oh, man. Oh, yeah, this is so weird.

13:41.187 --> 13:43.849
It like looks like I have eyeballs
or whatever.

13:43.956 --> 13:47.983
I smoked some weed the other...
Oh, shit, wait, hold on.

13:48.093 --> 13:51.085
I smoked some weed the other night
and I think the shit was laced,

13:51.197 --> 13:55.600
because I went out right away
and got these tattoos on my eyelids

13:55.701 --> 13:57.100
to make it look like when I was sleeping

13:57.203 --> 13:59.694
that people would think
that I was awake.

13:59.805 --> 14:01.773
Pete, you know
what might drive up the ratings?

14:01.874 --> 14:03.307
What about a celebrity host?

14:03.409 --> 14:04.967
Yeah. That would be great.

14:05.077 --> 14:07.637
We could get someone really cool,
like Jack Nicholson.

14:07.746 --> 14:10.408
Oh, yeah. I know where he lives
up in the Hollywood Hills.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.882
I know some guys who used
to dump over his garbage cans,

14:12.985 --> 14:14.646
like in a jealous rage.

14:14.753 --> 14:16.084
You remember Fat Johnny?

14:16.188 --> 14:18.122
- Powers.
- Yeah, you know Powers.

14:18.224 --> 14:22.160
- Yeah. He's a great guy.
- They used to shower together and shit.

14:22.261 --> 14:24.889
Well, not shower,
but they were friends with benefits.

14:24.997 --> 14:27.830
- No.
- And they spent...

14:27.933 --> 14:28.991
Hey, how about...

14:29.101 --> 14:32.502
Goddamn, I know one thing.
That fat bastard can eat, man.

14:32.605 --> 14:36.041
Fuck, yeah. I saw him
eat a cat once. It was crazy.

14:36.141 --> 14:39.508
I mean, this poor cat
didn't know what was happening.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.515
Or maybe it was a lobster he ate.

14:43.616 --> 14:44.981
- Pete.
- What?

14:45.084 --> 14:46.676
Bill Calhoun stopped by to see you.

14:46.785 --> 14:48.685
Oh, great. Tell him I'll be right there.

14:48.787 --> 14:51.950
All right, this is good. Come on,
let's keep it up. Keep thinking.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.389
Who the fuck is Jack Nocknuhson?

14:58.230 --> 14:59.629
Hey, Bill.

14:59.732 --> 15:03.224
- Oh, Pete. How you doing?
- Hey.

15:03.335 --> 15:05.098
- Caught you reminiscing, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah.

15:05.204 --> 15:07.434
I can't believe
how young I look in that photo.

15:07.539 --> 15:10.030
- Yeah, what is that? 15, 20 years?
- A lot more than that.

15:10.142 --> 15:12.702
Let me tell you something, Pete.
Time flies.

15:12.811 --> 15:15.712
Yeah. So, what brings you
down from the mountain, Bill?

15:15.814 --> 15:17.042
Business.

15:18.017 --> 15:19.314
That's Bigfoot.

15:20.552 --> 15:22.383
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.421
Where did you get these?

15:26.525 --> 15:29.426
Ecuador. And I know where he's hiding.
I got the map up at my cabin.

15:29.528 --> 15:30.961
This is great!

15:31.063 --> 15:33.793
Okay, we're gonna go to your cabin,
get the map, we'll go find Bigfoot.

15:33.899 --> 15:35.867
You just saved <i>Strange Wilderness,</i> Bill.

15:35.968 --> 15:37.299
Not quite so fast on that.

15:37.403 --> 15:40.566
Pete, you know I loved your daddy
like a brother,

15:40.673 --> 15:44.302
but Pierson is willing to give me
$1,000 for the map.

15:44.410 --> 15:46.503
- $1,000?
- Look, I need the money.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.580
Oh, Bill!

15:48.681 --> 15:51.548
You can't sell the map to Pierson.

15:51.650 --> 15:56.246
I don't know where
I'm gonna find $1,000. Jeez! What if...

15:57.523 --> 16:00.549
Hey, wait.
I got something better than $1,000.

16:01.193 --> 16:02.319
Yeah.

16:02.428 --> 16:05.420
I'll give you a piece of my show!

16:05.531 --> 16:08.625
Well, no, no. No, no, no.
I need the money kind of fast.

16:08.734 --> 16:09.792
It's all about net points.

16:09.902 --> 16:11.392
- You're gonna make a fortune. Yeah.
- Net?

16:11.503 --> 16:15.303
Look, 10% gets the per diem
backend accrued cost...

16:15.407 --> 16:18.706
Let's see,
times the employee overhead at 525,

16:18.811 --> 16:21.279
plus my finder's fee...

16:21.380 --> 16:23.007
Pete, isn't that the TV remote?

16:23.115 --> 16:24.582
Bill, don't change the subject!

16:24.683 --> 16:29.211
The point is you're gonna get 10%,
which comes out to be a fortune!

16:29.321 --> 16:32.313
Look, I wouldn't be doing this
if I wasn't strapped for cash!

16:32.424 --> 16:35.757
I gotta have 1,000 bucks,
or I gotta go to Pierson.

16:39.531 --> 16:42.659
All right. All right. I'll get the money.

16:42.768 --> 16:45.168
I'll have it in a week.
I'll see you at your cabin by the 15th.

16:45.270 --> 16:46.965
- By God, you got a deal.
- All right.

16:47.072 --> 16:49.973
I'm glad this is going to you
and not that Pierson.

16:51.510 --> 16:54.775
- Damn. These are great.
- Yeah.

16:54.880 --> 16:58.077
- And Bill knows where this is?
- Yeah, South America.

16:58.183 --> 17:02.517
This is exactly what we needed. Okay?
This is gonna be the biggest show ever.

17:02.621 --> 17:03.918
Here's the plan.

17:04.022 --> 17:06.583
Okay, we're gonna shoot five wildlife
shows on the way down.

17:06.692 --> 17:11.026
Then we're gonna pay it off with the first
ever footage of the legendary Bigfoot.

17:11.130 --> 17:14.792
Pete, I think you just saved the show,
you son-of-a-gun.

17:14.900 --> 17:17.460
Your dad'd be proud of you, boy.

17:17.569 --> 17:20.402
Yeah, but doggone it, I don't think
I'm gonna make the big run, fellas.

17:20.506 --> 17:22.098
- I just can't.
- What?

17:22.207 --> 17:24.868
But numb nuts here'll
run your camera for you.

17:24.977 --> 17:28.708
- I understand. We're gonna miss you.
- I'll miss you, too.

17:28.814 --> 17:32.511
Now, listen, what about that $1,000
that Bill wants for these?

17:32.618 --> 17:35.109
All right. I need everyone to go home,

17:35.220 --> 17:37.381
scrape up as much cash
as you can find, all right?

17:37.489 --> 17:39.957
Think of this as an investment
in your future.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.459
If this works, we all work.

17:42.561 --> 17:45.428
And, people, this is gonna work.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.059
Hey, Debbie!

17:51.170 --> 17:52.330
Debbie!

17:52.438 --> 17:56.465
I need you to set up interviews
for an animal handler, stat!

17:57.342 --> 18:01.335
And for the last seven years,
I've worked at an auto body shop,

18:01.447 --> 18:05.781
so I don't really have any experience
in your field, per se.

18:05.884 --> 18:08.512
Never really handled animals before.

18:08.620 --> 18:10.713
But I have handled other things and...

18:10.823 --> 18:13.724
I don't know,
I just really need a job, so...

18:13.826 --> 18:15.088
Can we think about it?

18:15.194 --> 18:19.631
Yeah. And not very hard?
You really needing a job is depressing.

18:19.731 --> 18:23.531
You smell of desperation.
I mean, who wants to be around that?

18:23.635 --> 18:28.072
Well, I wouldn't smell like desperation
if I had the job, right?

18:28.173 --> 18:31.472
Well, if you want,
we could hire you, fire you,

18:31.577 --> 18:33.101
push you into a mud puddle,

18:33.212 --> 18:37.012
and then you can keep this
whole sad sack train chugging along.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.084
Jesus, man,
a month on the road with this guy,

18:39.184 --> 18:41.709
I'd shove an exhaust pipe
through my fucking heart.

18:41.820 --> 18:44.118
Yeah, why don't you go
make a blues album?

18:44.223 --> 18:47.215
Yeah, you could call it
"I'm a Poor, Little Sad Sack."

18:47.893 --> 18:48.917
No job.

18:49.027 --> 18:51.587
Next! Debbie!

18:51.697 --> 18:54.131
I don't want the job.
Thank you, but no thanks.

18:54.233 --> 18:56.133
Next applicant!

18:56.235 --> 18:57.429
No, thank you.

18:57.536 --> 18:59.697
Maybe you can offer the job
to a crazy person.

18:59.805 --> 19:00.863
You'll have better luck.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.770
Next!

19:02.875 --> 19:04.809
You guys are out of your fucking minds.

19:04.910 --> 19:08.471
Yeah. Yeah. Run back to junior high.
It'll be great.

19:08.580 --> 19:10.946
Debbie! Debbie!

19:11.049 --> 19:12.482
You're off-the-chart nuts!

19:12.584 --> 19:13.551
Next!

19:13.652 --> 19:14.880
- You're insane!
- Next!

19:14.987 --> 19:16.978
- And rude!
- Debbie!

19:17.089 --> 19:22.721
- Debbie!
- Next!

19:24.429 --> 19:27.125
Well, welcome aboard, Whitaker.
We're gonna have a great trip.

19:27.232 --> 19:29.427
Thanks for hiring me, guys.
I really appreciate it.

19:29.535 --> 19:32.333
I just want you to know I'm gonna
apply myself and do the best I can

19:32.437 --> 19:34.598
to be the best animal handler
you guys have ever had.

19:34.706 --> 19:37.869
I know I don't know a lot about animals,
but I'm gonna learn, I'm gonna read.

19:37.976 --> 19:40.843
I feel like I got a handle on, you know,
what the best way to be an animal, so...

19:40.946 --> 19:42.573
- Good job.
- Keep it up.

19:43.949 --> 19:45.849
Okay, take care now.

19:45.951 --> 19:49.079
Well, hello. So, Cheryl, I'm sure this...

19:49.188 --> 19:52.487
Glad you could join us.
This is Cheryl, Fred.

19:52.591 --> 19:56.049
- Hi. How are you?
- Cheryl's friends with cousin Bob.

19:56.161 --> 19:57.628
Travel agent.

19:57.729 --> 19:59.492
Yeah. She's gonna...

19:59.598 --> 20:03.227
I'm sorry, Bob did not tell me
that you were so damn...

20:05.003 --> 20:06.129
Sorry?

20:07.206 --> 20:08.400
Nothing.

20:09.575 --> 20:10.735
Okay.

20:11.643 --> 20:16.273
Okay, the plan is, all right, is to head
towards the coast through the Mojave

20:16.381 --> 20:19.316
and then we'll just make a quick detour
to the Tribily Mountains

20:19.418 --> 20:21.978
to Bill Calhoun's cabin,
grab the map and cross the border.

20:22.087 --> 20:23.850
Great. Good job, Cheryl.

20:23.956 --> 20:26.584
Gotta go. Keep on keeping on.

20:26.692 --> 20:30.059
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

20:30.162 --> 20:32.096
You know, she seems nice.
I really like her.

20:32.197 --> 20:36.429
Oh, man, halfway through this trip,
she'll fall for me.

20:36.535 --> 20:38.935
- I'll be laying some serious pipe.
- Oh, yeah.

20:39.037 --> 20:40.368
- Hi, what's up?
- Hey!

20:40.472 --> 20:43.100
I just felt like I should assure you,
you know, I get it.

20:43.208 --> 20:45.699
I mean, you guys have been together
for a really, really long time.

20:45.811 --> 20:47.005
You're about to go out
into the wilderness.

20:47.112 --> 20:49.205
I mean, the last thing you need
is a woman in your midst

20:49.314 --> 20:51.714
to short-circuit the whole process.

20:51.817 --> 20:53.148
Debbie the downer, right?

20:53.252 --> 20:56.278
"Oh, no, can't talk amongst ourselves.
Here she comes," you know?

20:56.388 --> 20:58.219
I'm not gonna
bring that to the table, okay?

20:58.323 --> 21:01.417
Like the whole "laying pipe" thing?
It's funny. It really is funny.

21:01.526 --> 21:03.016
You know, I get it.
I know how that works.

21:03.128 --> 21:04.618
You make an announcement like that,

21:04.730 --> 21:06.891
all your friends laugh,
they think you're into girls

21:06.999 --> 21:08.466
and you make it through another day.

21:08.567 --> 21:12.003
But look, I mean, if you wanna
fight the fight and keep on keeping on,

21:12.104 --> 21:16.541
like the gay kids like to say,
well, that's your own prerogative.

21:16.642 --> 21:19.975
Sorry, I think it's the...
Yep, it's the liaison from Mexico.

21:25.083 --> 21:27.415
What just happened?

21:27.519 --> 21:29.612
Shit, I don't know.

21:29.721 --> 21:33.589
I'm no longer so sure
about that laying the pipe thing, though.

21:34.960 --> 21:39.124
Cooker, I thought I told you
to put this stuff in the RV.

21:39.231 --> 21:42.029
Oh, man, it's already in there.

21:42.134 --> 21:45.433
I'm looking right at it! It's not in the RV!

21:45.537 --> 21:47.869
- Oh, this stuff?
- Yeah.

21:47.973 --> 21:50.601
Oh, no, yeah,
this stuff's not in the RV yet.

21:52.511 --> 21:55.002
God damn it.
Five minutes to get from the...

21:55.113 --> 21:58.207
I got 10 more feet to get in the RV,
anybody else wanna say something?

21:58.317 --> 21:59.784
All right, yeah, hey...

21:59.885 --> 22:03.753
- I'm sorry. Sorry. Hi.
- Sorry. Hi.

22:03.855 --> 22:04.913
I forgot what I was gonna say.

22:05.023 --> 22:06.251
- Me too, then. Okay.
- Okay.

22:06.358 --> 22:09.953
Pete. This oil looks a little thick.
Maybe I should add some water.

22:10.962 --> 22:12.156
Sure.

22:13.598 --> 22:14.758
Okay.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.495
Locked and loaded.
Over and out. Let's go.

22:17.602 --> 22:18.728
Shit.

23:19.498 --> 23:23.127
Have you guys ever tried to poop
and brush your teeth at the same time?

23:23.235 --> 23:24.896
- It's fucking hard.
- Nice.

23:27.906 --> 23:32.866
<i>If you're my stepmom Phyllis,</i>
<i>then fuck you</i>

23:34.780 --> 23:37.442
<i>If you're my new brothers and sisters</i>

23:37.549 --> 23:42.646
<i>Dakota and Breckenridge,</i>
<i>then fuck you, too</i>

23:42.754 --> 23:44.847
<i>Listen up, world</i>

23:46.191 --> 23:51.094
<i>Hey, Dad, why'd you marry that ho?</i>

23:51.196 --> 23:53.960
Hey, three-letter word for "man."

23:55.967 --> 23:57.195
Dude.

23:57.302 --> 24:00.271
That's four letters. Dud. Dud, maybe.

24:01.373 --> 24:04.774
By the way, isn't that like
your fourth beer this morning?

24:04.876 --> 24:07.845
What? It's just a cordial.

24:07.946 --> 24:10.278
- Bottle snack.
- God.

24:10.816 --> 24:15.150
<i>Don't tell me to turn my music down</i>

24:17.756 --> 24:19.587
<i>Because there's tons</i>
<i>of different opinions</i>

24:19.691 --> 24:24.492
<i>On what the volume of music</i>
<i>that should be played in your house is</i>

24:26.231 --> 24:31.134
<i>Plus, we all know Phyllis has</i>
<i>super-fucking-sensitive hearing</i>

24:32.637 --> 24:39.566
<i>I don't think it's right for her to tell me</i>
<i>to turn off my fucking music</i>

24:41.780 --> 24:44.112
Hey, look, everybody, sea lions!

24:47.419 --> 24:49.387
All right, let's hustle down there
and shoot some of this.

24:49.488 --> 24:52.116
This should be a perfect show
on our way to Bigfoot country.

24:52.224 --> 24:53.714
Hey, Danny, get your seal...

24:53.825 --> 24:56.419
Yo, yo, I'm way ahead of you morons.

24:56.528 --> 24:58.519
I'm gonna sneak up
on these fucking bad boys

24:58.630 --> 25:01.224
and get you guys angles
that'll blow you away.

25:15.914 --> 25:17.779
Okay, great. Let's go.

25:20.552 --> 25:24.113
<i>En route to Bill Calhoun's cabin,</i>
<i>we had time to meet up</i>

25:24.222 --> 25:29.558
<i>with some of nature's</i>
<i>most awesome creatures, Mr. Sea Lion.</i>

25:29.661 --> 25:32.994
<i>No matter how many sea lions</i>
<i>are eaten each year by sharks,</i>

25:33.098 --> 25:35.862
<i>it never seems like enough.</i>

25:35.967 --> 25:37.696
<i>When a shark appears in the area,</i>

25:37.802 --> 25:40.464
<i>sea lions</i>
<i>will leave the water immediately.</i>

25:40.572 --> 25:43.666
<i>Luckily, there are no tigers on shore</i>
<i>waiting for him,</i>

25:43.775 --> 25:46.243
<i>or he wouldn't know what the fuck to do.</i>

25:46.344 --> 25:48.904
<i>A sea lion's main diet is fish,</i>

25:49.014 --> 25:51.539
<i>of which there are</i>
<i>many different species.</i>

25:51.650 --> 25:53.811
<i>Here we see the puffer fish.</i>

25:53.919 --> 25:59.516
<i>Our best guess is that this fish inflates</i>
<i>by sucking its balls into its stomach.</i>

25:59.624 --> 26:01.785
<i>This odd-looking fish</i>
<i>is called a squiggly.</i>

26:01.893 --> 26:03.554
<i>Wait, dude, can I just talk?</i>
<i>Can I just say one thing?</i>

26:03.662 --> 26:05.323
<i>Dude, give me the fucking...</i>

26:05.430 --> 26:06.920
- <i>Please, please. Really.</i>
- <i>Give me the fucking microphone.</i>

26:07.032 --> 26:09.330
- <i>Why is that pink thong running so fast?</i>
- <i>God.</i>

26:09.434 --> 26:10.401
<i>Sorry.</i>

26:10.502 --> 26:13.630
<i>Dude, this is a show about sea lions,</i>
<i>God damn it.</i>

26:13.738 --> 26:16.263
<i>But to get closer</i>
<i>to these remarkable creatures,</i>

26:16.374 --> 26:19.901
<i>we put our driver, Danny Gutierrez,</i>
<i>in a sea lion costume.</i>

26:20.011 --> 26:24.744
<i>Unfortunately, after only a few seconds,</i>
<i>Danny was attacked by a shark.</i>

26:24.849 --> 26:28.808
<i>Oh, fuck! Oh, no, no, no!</i>
<i>Leave him alone!</i>

26:28.920 --> 26:34.187
<i>No, get off him, he's my friend!</i>
<i>Please stop it!</i>

26:37.596 --> 26:41.760
Wow. I'm just blown away
by how violent that was.

26:41.866 --> 26:46.326
Those razor-sharp teeth
were as sharp as razors.

26:47.806 --> 26:50.366
It was just so gruesome, you know?

26:50.475 --> 26:54.969
All the thrashing and all the blood...

26:56.348 --> 26:57.542
It's okay. It's okay.

26:57.649 --> 27:00.584
Yeah. No, he's... It's gonna be okay.

27:00.685 --> 27:04.815
I mean, these things happen.
I mean, not all the time, but still.

27:04.923 --> 27:06.151
Cheryl,

27:07.158 --> 27:08.887
just thank you for being my friend.

27:08.994 --> 27:10.222
Thanks.

27:13.264 --> 27:15.425
You are such an asshole!

27:15.533 --> 27:19.765
Oh, shit, two funny things at once.

27:19.871 --> 27:22.066
I was trying to help you feel better.

27:22.173 --> 27:24.869
Then you hit me in the head.
Now there's a bump on my head.

27:24.976 --> 27:26.876
It looks like a dinosaur egg.

27:26.978 --> 27:29.003
If that dinosaur hatches,

27:29.114 --> 27:32.379
people are gonna think I'm
some sort of prehistoric gentleman bird.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.247
And how the fuck do you think
that makes me...

27:34.352 --> 27:37.321
It's fine. It's fine. I'll get over it.

27:37.422 --> 27:39.754
Hey, guys, look at that bug over there.

27:41.426 --> 27:43.087
Oh, yeah.

27:43.194 --> 27:45.856
Hey, break out the equipment.

27:45.964 --> 27:49.866
As long as we're here we might as well
roll some footage, right? Come on.

27:49.968 --> 27:52.436
Junior, get over here.

27:52.537 --> 27:55.472
Look at this. This is great.
Get in here, right now.

27:55.573 --> 27:59.475
Get that right there.
Wait, I got a noise. Hold on.

28:01.346 --> 28:02.643
Go ahead.

28:05.316 --> 28:06.749
Excuse me!

28:06.851 --> 28:09.615
Gentlemen, hi.
We're trying to do a shoot here

28:09.721 --> 28:12.781
and we were just wondering if you could
maybe stop honking the horn

28:12.891 --> 28:14.449
until we're finished?

28:14.559 --> 28:17.824
No speak <i>de inglés, buey.</i>
I need <i>$100, por favor.</i>

28:17.929 --> 28:20.454
- Are you trying to blackmail us?
- Hey, you know.

28:20.565 --> 28:22.157
<i>Hola, cómo estás?</i> How are you?

28:24.836 --> 28:26.963
I'll stop honking for $100, okay?

28:27.072 --> 28:30.633
Let me handle this.
I speak the language of their people.

28:38.983 --> 28:40.814
Is time

28:42.887 --> 28:47.415
to stop de horn from honking,

28:47.525 --> 28:48.753
please?

28:55.934 --> 28:58.232
Let me try a different approach.

28:59.704 --> 29:03.504
No, no, no, no! Slow it down, brother.
Let's talk this out.

29:03.608 --> 29:04.836
I ain't gonna talk, homes.
I'm gonna punch!

29:04.943 --> 29:06.240
No, you don't wanna do that,

29:06.344 --> 29:08.335
'cause that's gonna cause
some serious trouble, brother.

29:08.446 --> 29:10.038
For who,
you Super Mario-looking motherfucker?

29:10.148 --> 29:12.673
Actually, it's gonna cause some
trouble for you and let me explain why.

29:12.784 --> 29:15.309
- 'Cause see, you're a big, powerful man.
- That's true, homes.

29:15.420 --> 29:18.287
Actually, you're so powerful,
and he's such a pussy,

29:18.389 --> 29:20.118
your punch is probably gonna kill him.

29:20.225 --> 29:22.693
And then what?
They're gonna fry you, homes.

29:22.794 --> 29:26.389
All right. Well, what about the scratch
he put on my front hood?

29:26.498 --> 29:28.398
I didn't go near your front hood, man.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.900
Yeah, you did, homes. It's right there.
Take a look, pussy.

29:31.002 --> 29:33.197
- Yeah, look at it, pussy!
- Fuck you, Fred!

29:33.304 --> 29:34.271
Hey, you too, homes.

29:34.372 --> 29:37.034
Take a look. Lean closer, both of you.
Look, closer. You see it?

29:37.142 --> 29:38.837
I don't see any scratch.

29:40.979 --> 29:43.379
You just got knocked the fuck out!

29:49.087 --> 29:50.816
Oh, my God.

29:50.922 --> 29:55.621
Hello. We would like
to see a dentist, please.

29:55.727 --> 29:59.561
Well, have a seat, and the dentist
will be able to see you in about an hour.

29:59.664 --> 30:03.191
I'm sorry. Did you just say, "Have a seat,

30:03.301 --> 30:06.464
"and the dentist will be able to see you
in about an hour"?

30:06.571 --> 30:10.974
There are a couple of people in front
of you. Would you like a magazine?

30:11.075 --> 30:13.009
I'll take a Batman magazine.

30:13.111 --> 30:18.139
Dude, that's a comic book.
She said "magazine."

30:18.249 --> 30:22.015
I'm sorry about that.
I'll have a <i>Penthouse?</i>

30:22.120 --> 30:24.748
We don't have
<i>Penthouse</i> magazine, sir.

30:29.427 --> 30:31.520
I guess we'll wait.

30:38.369 --> 30:40.735
- Fred?
- Yeah?

30:40.839 --> 30:42.739
- Go color.
- All right.

30:45.643 --> 30:48.339
No magazines.

30:48.446 --> 30:50.277
A whole hour to kill.

30:51.883 --> 30:54.078
Hello there.

30:55.320 --> 30:57.652
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

31:00.425 --> 31:02.950
All right, everybody, listen up.

31:03.061 --> 31:05.552
We're flat busted. We're broke.

31:08.733 --> 31:11.930
Two days on the road
and we're already fucked.

31:12.036 --> 31:15.335
Hey, guys! Check this shit out.

31:15.440 --> 31:18.807
Boosted some nitrous from
the dentist's office. It was so awesome.

31:18.910 --> 31:21.105
I just, like, grabbed it and they were
like, "What are you doing?"

31:21.212 --> 31:25.308
And I go, "It's cool, man.
I'm a dentist, I need to use this shit."

31:25.416 --> 31:27.247
Do you know what this shit is worth
on the street, man?

31:27.352 --> 31:29.582
This is like $1,000.

31:29.687 --> 31:31.120
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, I know.

31:31.222 --> 31:34.589
You've got to put that back, okay? Fuck!

31:34.692 --> 31:38.389
We cannot afford to get busted
stealing nitrous.

31:38.496 --> 31:42.455
Okay. So most of us think
that we should keep the nitrous,

31:42.567 --> 31:46.230
sell it so we can finance the entire trip,
save <i>Strange Wilderness.</i>

31:46.337 --> 31:49.864
And deep down inside so does Cheryl,
so it's unanimous.

31:49.974 --> 31:52.067
Let's do it! This is gonna work out!

31:52.176 --> 31:54.041
- Thank you, Cheryl!
- All right!

32:13.398 --> 32:16.026
Are you guys feeling kind of weird?

32:22.440 --> 32:24.704
All right! How are we feeling?

32:45.129 --> 32:48.257
Oh, my head hurts so bad.

32:48.366 --> 32:51.460
- This nitrous thing's empty.
- It is?

32:51.569 --> 32:54.163
Well, there goes that thousand dollars
we were gonna make.

32:54.272 --> 32:55.864
We're broke!

33:04.482 --> 33:07.383
Yeah, this is it. Bill's place.

33:18.029 --> 33:21.362
Where in the hell have you guys been?
You're three days late.

33:22.467 --> 33:24.025
Wipe your feet.

33:27.338 --> 33:31.741
Whoa, Bill. Going a little nuts up here?

33:31.843 --> 33:33.674
Somebody's ready for Armageddon.

33:33.778 --> 33:36.076
Look, I tried calling you guys.

33:36.180 --> 33:39.206
- I sold the map.
- What? You sold it?

33:39.317 --> 33:41.148
Well, I had to, to Pierson.

33:41.252 --> 33:42.276
- Pierson?
- Pierson?

33:42.387 --> 33:43.513
Oh, my God.

33:43.621 --> 33:46.613
- Why'd you do it? We had a deal!
- You're three days late.

33:46.724 --> 33:48.521
I didn't think you were coming.
You didn't call.

33:48.626 --> 33:51.060
And like I told you back in the office,
I needed the money.

33:51.162 --> 33:53.596
Wait, so, he's halfway
to finding Bigfoot by now.

33:53.698 --> 33:56.792
- Yeah.
- Great! I can't believe it.

33:56.901 --> 33:59.165
Bill, what did you need the money
so bad for?

33:59.270 --> 34:02.728
Lithium and Darvon, Pete.
Depression eats at me day and night.

34:02.840 --> 34:06.105
I live in a world of paranoia,
as you can tell.

34:06.210 --> 34:07.768
I'm sorry, Pete.

34:08.980 --> 34:11.141
It's okay, Bill. It's okay.

34:12.483 --> 34:14.507
Hey, wait a minute.

34:14.619 --> 34:16.678
Hold on a second.

34:16.788 --> 34:20.053
I think I know a way to make
my paranoia pay off for you guys.

34:20.158 --> 34:23.491
Go out and change clothes and come
back and I got something to show you.

34:23.594 --> 34:27.530
- Okay.
- Yeah, this is gonna work out, I hope.

34:27.632 --> 34:30.623
All right, here's the deal. I sold
Pierson the map, fair and square, right?

34:30.735 --> 34:33.067
He's got a three-day head start,
he's got no complaints.

34:33.170 --> 34:36.663
So nobody can say I can't give you guys
a copy of the map, now is there?

34:36.774 --> 34:38.536
I'm gonna find you one.

34:38.643 --> 34:41.543
See, at one point or another during the
day they were walking around here,

34:41.646 --> 34:43.670
reading the map
under these security cameras.

34:43.781 --> 34:46.750
Now all I gotta do is find it
and zoom in on it.

34:46.851 --> 34:48.978
- Hey, did you see that?
- What?

34:49.087 --> 34:51.920
That's just me saying goodbye
to the wife 'fore I went out hunting.

34:52.023 --> 34:54.081
- Back that up.
- Okay.

35:01.032 --> 35:03.193
What the hell's she doing?

35:03.301 --> 35:08.466
Hey, that's Pierson,
and he's going into my bedroom.

35:10.141 --> 35:11.472
God.

35:13.211 --> 35:15.873
Oh, work it.

35:15.980 --> 35:19.245
Oh, slice me off a piece of that.
I got a sweet tooth.

35:19.350 --> 35:23.946
Oh, my God. I'll ask for second helpings
on that and still lick the plate...

35:25.089 --> 35:27.489
Pierson is an asshole!

35:27.592 --> 35:29.992
All right, all bets are off.
I'm gonna find you that map,

35:30.094 --> 35:33.461
and you're gonna find Bigfoot before
that degenerate pervert bastard does.

35:33.564 --> 35:35.691
- Yeah, we are.
- Come on, come on.

35:35.800 --> 35:39.201
Walk to the camera like a good
little puppet now. All right, now.

35:39.303 --> 35:41.498
Going to camera three.

35:41.606 --> 35:45.702
There it is. There it is.
Now all I gotta do is zoom in on it and...

35:45.810 --> 35:46.834
Bingo!

35:46.944 --> 35:49.037
Pierson may have the map
and a three-days' head start,

35:49.147 --> 35:50.512
but that won't be enough.

35:50.615 --> 35:51.673
Thanks.

35:51.782 --> 35:55.445
Because now you have the map and I'm
gonna give you a little something extra.

35:55.553 --> 35:57.578
His name is Gus Hayden.

35:57.688 --> 36:00.748
You are shitting me.
You know Bigfoot's name?

36:00.858 --> 36:05.522
No, no, Pete.
This tracker, his name is Gus Hayden.

36:05.630 --> 36:07.257
Now, Gus and I
were in Vietnam together.

36:07.365 --> 36:10.698
He is the best that ever lived.
He's practically supernatural.

36:10.801 --> 36:13.463
Now, if anybody can help you find
Bigfoot before these assholes,

36:13.571 --> 36:15.368
it's Gus Hayden.

36:15.473 --> 36:20.467
Now, he normally charges 3,000 bucks
but I'm gonna get him to do it for 500.

36:20.578 --> 36:22.011
500.

36:23.080 --> 36:25.105
We're at

36:27.451 --> 36:29.646
- 14 bucks.
- What?

36:29.754 --> 36:32.814
It's a long story, but,
yeah, we're broke, Bill.

36:32.924 --> 36:35.392
Well, so am I or I'd loan you the money.

36:35.493 --> 36:38.485
'Cause now you not only gotta find
Bigfoot to save your show,

36:38.596 --> 36:41.565
you gotta find Bigfoot
to screw over Pierson.

36:41.666 --> 36:43.224
I don't know
how you gonna raise that cash

36:43.334 --> 36:45.097
but you gotta promise me one thing.

36:45.203 --> 36:49.333
When you catch up to Pierson, you give
him a shot square in the face for me.

36:50.608 --> 36:54.544
Shit, man. We can't raise 500 bucks.

36:54.645 --> 36:56.442
Sounds like we're screwed.

36:56.547 --> 36:59.038
That's great.
Trip's over before it even began.

36:59.150 --> 37:02.119
Hey, Pete,
I got some great beaver footage.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.916
- That's great. I gotta go take a leak.
- Yeah.

37:05.022 --> 37:08.617
Look, we'll go into town
and, I don't know, do something.

37:10.328 --> 37:11.761
Why, what's going on?

37:11.862 --> 37:13.386
Money problems.

37:28.813 --> 37:32.943
Hi there, little guys.
I didn't see you there.

37:34.218 --> 37:36.345
Almost got you, huh?

37:36.454 --> 37:38.854
Hey, where's mama turkey?

37:38.956 --> 37:40.446
Oh, my God!

37:43.361 --> 37:48.594
What's the turkey doing?
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

37:49.300 --> 37:50.665
Oh, my God!

37:53.337 --> 37:54.895
Oh, my God!

37:55.006 --> 37:56.303
Oh, my God!

37:56.407 --> 37:57.874
Look out!

38:02.079 --> 38:03.740
It's surprising, really.

38:03.848 --> 38:06.942
Now, its gag reflexes
should have kicked in by now.

38:07.051 --> 38:09.713
Nurse, I want you to massage
the neck of the turkey

38:09.820 --> 38:12.118
and let's see
if we can relax this little fella.

38:12.223 --> 38:14.282
- Yes, Doctor.
- Junior, turn off the camera.

38:14.392 --> 38:16.986
- Okay, I'll get another angle.
- Now relax. Just relax.

38:17.094 --> 38:20.757
Oh, nice.
You got mad, good medical skills.

38:21.465 --> 38:25.663
Relax, Mr. Turkey. Relax. Relax.

38:25.770 --> 38:27.829
Walk up the beak.

38:27.938 --> 38:30.270
I spit in my hand when I do that.

38:30.374 --> 38:34.174
Oh, Christ. You've got to be kidding me.

38:34.278 --> 38:37.475
Doctor, he has an erection.

38:37.581 --> 38:40.448
You need to stifle your sexual response.

38:40.551 --> 38:43.179
You're only tightening yourself
inside its neck.

38:43.287 --> 38:45.152
Doc, the nurse is fucking hot.

38:46.190 --> 38:48.215
Can somebody else
do me, please? Fred?

38:48.326 --> 38:49.884
Fuck that, dude.

38:49.994 --> 38:51.689
- Whitaker?
- Whitaker, what?

38:51.796 --> 38:53.559
What? You're the animal handler, man.

38:53.664 --> 38:56.633
Bullshit, I was a car mechanic
last week, man.

38:56.734 --> 38:58.998
Now, if you want me to change
the spark plugs on the RV, I'll do that,

38:59.103 --> 39:00.127
but I'm not gonna handle you.

39:00.237 --> 39:03.866
I think a little shot of Demerol
ought to relax it.

39:03.974 --> 39:05.498
That went right into my dick!

39:05.609 --> 39:08.237
Well, that really
shouldn't have happened. Sorry.

39:08.346 --> 39:11.179
Well, now that the Demerol's probably
coursing through your system,

39:11.282 --> 39:13.182
it could complicate things.

39:13.284 --> 39:14.342
Here's an idea.

39:14.452 --> 39:17.182
Mr. Gaulke, can you urinate?

39:17.288 --> 39:20.689
That might do it. It might
stimulate the turkey's gag reflex.

39:20.791 --> 39:23.726
You want him
to piss that turkey off his hog?

39:23.828 --> 39:26.296
Well, I mean,
put yourself in the turkey's position...

39:26.397 --> 39:30.857
Doctor, I believe that this young turkey
hasn't yet come out of the closet.

39:30.968 --> 39:34.768
So, if we could take a snapshot of it
getting gay with Peter here,

39:34.872 --> 39:38.205
we can maybe threaten
to send it to his father.

39:38.309 --> 39:40.277
And then he'll be like,
"No, don't tell my dad."

39:40.378 --> 39:42.175
And he'll stop blowing Peter.

39:43.581 --> 39:46.015
Or we could chop his fucking head off.

39:47.585 --> 39:49.849
Holy hell! He did!

39:49.954 --> 39:51.216
He found our turkey!

39:51.322 --> 39:53.381
We've been searching for her
for three months.

39:53.491 --> 39:55.982
How in the hell
did she get caught up in this position?

39:56.093 --> 39:57.754
Yeah, it's Maggie, all right.

39:57.862 --> 39:59.329
You know what?
You guys can have her back

39:59.430 --> 40:00.920
right after we chop her head off.

40:01.031 --> 40:02.396
No, you can't kill it.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.968
This bird is part of an ongoing
government study. We want her back.

40:05.069 --> 40:08.197
Look, there is a $5,000 reward
for her alive.

40:08.305 --> 40:11.900
$5,000? Whoa, hey! Doc, no.
Hold on a second.

40:12.009 --> 40:13.169
Gentlemen.

40:13.277 --> 40:14.437
Now that we have the map

40:14.545 --> 40:17.446
and we're gonna get five grand
for this stupid bird here,

40:17.548 --> 40:19.675
we can go get Gus Hayden, the tracker.

40:19.784 --> 40:22.878
Come on, everyone, jump in.
Let's yank this sucker right off.

40:22.987 --> 40:25.182
- Did you just say yank?
- Yes, we did.

40:25.289 --> 40:26.654
I'm gonna be gentle, but firm.

40:26.757 --> 40:29.419
One, two, three.

41:04.628 --> 41:05.856
Fucking <i>Federales,</i> dude.

41:05.963 --> 41:08.022
I got weed on me.
I'll meet you on the other side.

41:08.132 --> 41:10.532
Don't worry, I'll take care of this.

41:10.634 --> 41:12.303
Hold on. Back up here.

41:13.838 --> 41:15.135
Excuse me.

41:15.239 --> 41:20.700
Let us into Mexico, please?

41:26.050 --> 41:29.383
Okay, so, thank you!
I guess I checked out, then.

41:30.788 --> 41:33.552
Look at that! I guess our RV is tore up.

41:33.657 --> 41:35.557
Well, guess we'll have to take a plane
the rest of the way.

41:35.659 --> 41:36.887
Oh, well. Come on, let's go.

41:36.994 --> 41:39.724
- Dude, what happened in there, man?
- Nothing. Really cool people.

41:39.830 --> 41:41.127
So, come on, let's book.

41:41.232 --> 41:42.597
What, really?
I mean, everything okay in there?

41:42.700 --> 41:44.099
- 'Cause you look really pale.
- Yeah.

41:44.201 --> 41:46.965
That's because I wear sun block,
you ass. Okay?

41:47.071 --> 41:49.403
So, come on, let's grab that airplane
and get out of here.

41:53.177 --> 41:56.010
- So, what happened in that room?
- Drop it.

41:56.113 --> 41:58.377
- Drop what?
- Okay, look, they...

41:58.482 --> 42:01.645
Oh, come on! I come in peace, brother.
Come on.

42:01.752 --> 42:04.448
You guys, the plane's boarding.
Come on.

42:04.555 --> 42:06.955
Hey guys, I need to tell you something.

42:07.057 --> 42:09.150
What, you're quitting?
Come on, no, it's...

42:09.260 --> 42:11.854
No, no, I'm not quitting.
It's actually the opposite.

42:11.962 --> 42:13.259
I wanted to thank you guys.

42:13.364 --> 42:17.892
I took this job 'cause I needed it,
but I also took it for other reasons.

42:18.002 --> 42:21.631
I figured a trip into the jungle would
be a kind of a forced sobriety for me,

42:21.739 --> 42:25.334
and that's something
I really need in my life.

42:25.442 --> 42:28.605
My name's Bill W.
and I'm an alcoholic.

42:28.712 --> 42:30.543
- Hey, Bill.
- Hi, Bill.

42:30.648 --> 42:33.515
Because of that, I've never really fit in
anywhere, you know?

42:33.617 --> 42:38.452
I want to tell you guys.
Couple days ago, I took my last drink.

42:38.556 --> 42:43.152
And then I did yesterday, and, well,
God willing, this'll really be the last one.

42:43.260 --> 42:46.889
'Cause we're going to the jungle and
I got some tough times ahead of me.

42:46.997 --> 42:49.329
But you guys
have been really great to me.

42:49.433 --> 42:53.096
And I just want to say that you've
really made me part of your family

42:53.203 --> 42:54.830
and I wanna say thank you for that.

42:54.939 --> 42:56.406
- That's so sweet.
- Thank you.

42:56.507 --> 43:01.308
Whitaker, that is some of the finest
words I've ever heard in my life.

43:01.412 --> 43:04.609
And just hearing them makes me feel
like I'm a better person.

43:04.715 --> 43:07.582
So, fuck it, man. Take a bow.

43:10.754 --> 43:15.453
He was like, "I'm an alcoholic."
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

43:49.994 --> 43:51.154
<i>Strange Wilderness?</i>

43:51.261 --> 43:54.924
That's us.
I'm Pete, and this is the rest of them.

43:56.533 --> 43:58.000
Hi, I'm Cheryl.

43:58.102 --> 44:00.400
- It is so nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

44:00.504 --> 44:03.667
Yeah, Bill told me
what Pierson did to his wife.

44:03.774 --> 44:06.106
Bill's a good man.
Shouldn't have happened to him.

44:06.210 --> 44:09.179
He's upset. That's why he asked me
to get you to Gus Hayden.

44:09.279 --> 44:11.747
- That's great. Great.
- Now for the bad news.

44:11.849 --> 44:13.339
Pierson's got about
a three-day jump on you.

44:13.450 --> 44:15.281
- Oh, no.
- But, hey, don't worry about it.

44:15.386 --> 44:16.444
We'll find him.

44:16.553 --> 44:17.713
Tell you what, we'll go up to Gus's

44:17.821 --> 44:20.415
and we'll head out from there
and make up for lost time.

44:20.524 --> 44:22.719
- All right.
- By the way, my name's Dick.

44:22.826 --> 44:24.191
Dick what?

44:25.996 --> 44:27.463
Just Dick.

44:27.564 --> 44:28.724
Dick?

44:29.767 --> 44:30.893
Dick.

44:31.969 --> 44:33.732
Like Cher, but Dick?

44:35.105 --> 44:36.265
Dick.

44:37.441 --> 44:40.968
He's fucking... Who is this?

44:41.078 --> 44:43.239
Dick, Dick, Dick, Dick, Dick.

44:47.718 --> 44:49.185
Gotta have more name than that, Dick.

44:49.286 --> 44:52.687
Nope. Just Dick.

44:52.790 --> 44:55.281
You say, "Dick," I come running.

44:57.961 --> 44:59.986
You come where?

45:00.097 --> 45:03.624
You like your name? You like Dick?

45:03.734 --> 45:06.567
Do you ever let your dog
lick your name?

45:06.670 --> 45:08.069
Yeah, do you like it?

45:08.172 --> 45:09.867
Is your name Dick?

45:11.475 --> 45:14.376
I don't wanna get started off
on the wrong foot with you guys.

45:14.478 --> 45:17.345
Does your name ever shrink
if you go in cold water?

45:17.448 --> 45:20.383
Snicker one more time, I'll kick
your balls up in your fucking neck.

45:20.484 --> 45:21.815
- Check.
- 10-4.

45:21.919 --> 45:23.079
Copy that.

45:23.187 --> 45:26.884
Our trail's about 23 clicks west of here.

45:26.990 --> 45:28.014
Right.

45:28.125 --> 45:29.615
Does your name ever get hard
in the morning?

45:29.727 --> 45:30.955
Shut the fuck up.

45:38.836 --> 45:41.999
<i>On our way to hook up</i>
<i>with legendary tracker, Gus Hayden,</i>

45:42.106 --> 45:46.634
<i>we encountered many jungle animals,</i>
<i>including our furry relative,</i>

45:46.744 --> 45:48.473
<i>the monkey.</i>

45:48.579 --> 45:52.515
<i>Monkeys make up over 80%</i>
<i>of the world's monkey population.</i>

45:53.784 --> 45:56.912
<i>Hundreds of ants are eaten each year</i>
<i>by monkeys.</i>

45:57.020 --> 46:00.319
<i>Researchers believe</i>
<i>that these numbers would be far less,</i>

46:00.424 --> 46:03.825
<i>if ants were the same size</i>
<i>or bigger than monkeys.</i>

46:03.927 --> 46:07.556
<i>Wow, look at that.</i>
<i>Those balls are sensational.</i>

46:07.664 --> 46:11.327
<i>To a lion,</i>
<i>these balls are called a "sack lunch."</i>

46:11.435 --> 46:14.996
<i>Over here,</i>
<i>we spot some South American gazelles.</i>

46:15.105 --> 46:17.767
<i>This gazelle is eating a flower.</i>

46:17.875 --> 46:20.537
<i>This lion is eating the gazelle.</i>

46:20.644 --> 46:23.807
<i>But he'll probably spit out the flower.</i>

46:23.914 --> 46:26.246
<i>These giraffes can't quit each other.</i>

46:26.350 --> 46:30.514
<i>I think it would be a good idea to tie</i>
<i>your brand new jeans to their heads.</i>

46:30.621 --> 46:34.523
<i>That way, your jeans</i>
<i>would get that distressed look.</i>

46:34.625 --> 46:37.822
<i>These birds are saying howdy</i>
<i>to the zebra.</i>

46:37.928 --> 46:41.557
<i>Actually, they're not saying howdy,</i>
<i>they're eating the shit out of him.</i>

46:41.665 --> 46:44.600
<i>If we held a microphone up to the zebra</i>
<i>and he could talk like,</i>

46:44.701 --> 46:48.899
<i>you know, Mr. Ed or something, it would</i>
<i>probably sound something like this,</i>

46:49.006 --> 46:52.965
<i>"Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God!</i>

46:53.076 --> 46:55.977
<i>"Did one of you just</i>
<i>shove your beak up my ass?"</i>

47:02.953 --> 47:04.944
All right. We'll walk from here.

47:05.923 --> 47:08.721
All right, let's go, chop-chop.
It's about three clicks that way.

47:08.826 --> 47:11.158
Stay on the trail. Follow me. Let's go.

47:12.062 --> 47:13.359
Let's go!

47:36.119 --> 47:40.749
All right. You're about to meet the
world's greatest tracker, Gus Hayden.

47:49.800 --> 47:52.200
Welcome to paradise.

47:52.302 --> 47:54.827
I hear we're gonna have a little fun.

47:56.240 --> 48:00.802
I shoved my knife through
the top of his skull into his brain.

48:00.911 --> 48:05.473
Then I grabbed my hand grenade,
pushed that into his head hole.

48:05.582 --> 48:09.382
And I shoved him back down into the
tunnel and ran like hell.

48:10.153 --> 48:11.484
Hey, Gus.

48:11.588 --> 48:13.146
That was a great Vietnam story.

48:13.257 --> 48:16.226
But I think...
You wanna let go of Fred there?

48:16.326 --> 48:19.056
I think you're close to killing him.

48:19.162 --> 48:21.995
Sorry, I forgot about you there, partner.

48:22.099 --> 48:23.498
Anyway, the little gook bit me,

48:23.600 --> 48:26.967
and that's how I got this scar
right here on this thumb.

48:27.070 --> 48:28.094
Cool.

48:28.205 --> 48:30.469
So, Gus, tell us,
what are we in store for tomorrow?

48:30.574 --> 48:32.474
We'll break camp at 0600.

48:32.576 --> 48:36.535
I want you all to understand that when
we head into the Coconga Wilderness,

48:36.647 --> 48:40.014
we'll be going into a bad, dark place

48:40.117 --> 48:42.847
where death is about as routine
as a change of pants.

48:42.953 --> 48:45.547
Well, this crew here?

48:45.656 --> 48:48.454
We've been through some
pretty hairy adventures of our own.

48:48.558 --> 48:51.118
And I know you got that little scar
there on your thumb,

48:51.228 --> 48:55.062
but we've gotten a few scars
over the years ourselves.

48:55.165 --> 48:56.962
- Isn't that right, Fred?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

48:57.067 --> 48:59.058
I mean, look at this one.

49:01.204 --> 49:03.399
Eight years old. Fell off my bike.

49:03.507 --> 49:04.565
Shit.

49:04.675 --> 49:07.439
Check out this guy. See that?

49:07.544 --> 49:11.640
I was doing some Bondo work
on a '67 Pontiac Sky Chief

49:11.748 --> 49:16.845
and I was drunk, as usual,
and caught this on the hood ornament.

49:19.723 --> 49:20.917
Nasty.

49:21.525 --> 49:24.255
But... Hey, two days sober today, guys.

49:25.128 --> 49:27.331
Thank you. Thank you very much.

49:27.331 --> 49:27.888
Thank you. Thank you very much.

49:27.998 --> 49:33.402
Well, I don't have any scars,
but I have this really great birthmark.

49:35.472 --> 49:36.734
See?

49:39.376 --> 49:42.868
You see this right here?
Dog bit me when I was a kid.

49:42.980 --> 49:44.641
I was blowing in his face,
and he nipped...

49:44.748 --> 49:48.047
Well, now.
You're talking scars, I got one for you.

49:48.151 --> 49:49.482
About 10 years ago

49:49.586 --> 49:53.044
I was scouting out a location
for a mining company in the Amazon,

49:53.156 --> 49:57.354
when I was ambushed
by a tribe of Aloha pygmies.

49:57.461 --> 50:01.591
They tied me to a post and did to me
what they do to all white men.

50:09.740 --> 50:13.699
They cut my scrotum with a sharp stick.
Then they ran away.

50:13.810 --> 50:17.268
My testicles unraveled down
to the ground.

50:17.381 --> 50:20.373
I scooped up my testicles
from out of the dirt, rolled them up,

50:20.484 --> 50:24.215
shoved them back into my sac,
and then sewed it shut myself.

50:30.560 --> 50:34.121
Looks like a quilt. A ball quilt.

50:36.233 --> 50:38.098
Okay, well...

50:38.201 --> 50:42.934
I'd love to sit here
and swap some more scar stories,

50:43.040 --> 50:44.837
but I'm all out.

50:44.941 --> 50:46.841
I'm tired.

50:46.943 --> 50:48.535
Yeah, you know what? Yeah, yeah.

50:48.645 --> 50:50.306
I'm gonna saw some logs, myself.

50:50.414 --> 50:52.314
- Yeah.
- All right. All right.

50:52.416 --> 50:55.214
Must have the worst nightmares ever.

51:06.263 --> 51:07.457
Pete.

51:08.465 --> 51:10.023
- Hey!
- What?

51:10.133 --> 51:13.534
Dude, that tracker guy left,
and Cheryl ran off with him.

51:13.637 --> 51:16.231
Cheryl? Cheryl!

51:16.339 --> 51:18.068
What? She ran off with Gus Hayden?

51:18.175 --> 51:20.871
She's gone, he's gone,
and all our shit's gone!

51:20.977 --> 51:24.538
- Hey, you're probably in on it!
- No!

51:24.648 --> 51:26.775
He left me just as stranded as you all.

51:26.883 --> 51:29.317
He took my bunker jeep.
We got nothing!

51:29.419 --> 51:33.082
- Shit! Why would Cheryl do this to us?
- No, no, no.

51:33.190 --> 51:36.648
I saw her eyeing that fucking psycho
across the campfire last night.

51:36.760 --> 51:39.661
Shit! Shit! God!

51:40.931 --> 51:43.229
Shit! Shit!

51:44.601 --> 51:45.829
God!

51:45.936 --> 51:49.269
All right, calm down!
Everybody, just pull yourself together!

51:50.841 --> 51:55.005
Bill, I need you to take an inventory
of everything that's left, okay? Go, now.

51:55.112 --> 51:58.673
Okay. We got one sleeping bag,

51:58.782 --> 52:00.181
so I think we're pretty much fucked.

52:00.283 --> 52:04.913
No, I think we're gonna be okay.
I think we're great. Let's go find Bigfoot.

52:05.021 --> 52:07.455
What aren't you hearing?
He took the map!

52:07.557 --> 52:09.115
We can't find Bigfoot without a map!

52:09.226 --> 52:12.252
Yeah, but we can't give up, okay?
We can't!

52:12.362 --> 52:15.559
'Cause my dad wouldn't give up.
You know that. You knew him.

52:15.665 --> 52:19.658
I mean, he'd always make it work out.
And I'm just like my dad!

52:20.604 --> 52:24.597
All right. Okay.
I'll lead you through the jungle.

52:24.708 --> 52:27.700
I'm going as far as Temescal,
but after that, you're on your own.

52:27.811 --> 52:31.042
- Okay.
- That jungle is thick.

52:31.148 --> 52:34.413
I don't think anybody's
ever even been in there.

52:34.518 --> 52:38.750
You know, you should quit now,
while you're alive.

52:38.855 --> 52:41.187
Nope. Not on my watch.

52:41.291 --> 52:42.349
Guys?

52:42.459 --> 52:43.653
I don't wanna die.

52:43.760 --> 52:46.786
For the first time in 11 years,
I'm seeing the world through sober eyes

52:46.897 --> 52:49.491
and it's exhilarating.

52:49.599 --> 52:51.533
See, I have so much to live for
right now.

52:51.635 --> 52:55.127
I want to find a nice girl
and settle down and have kids

52:55.238 --> 52:57.900
and dance with them in the moonlight
and everything.

52:58.008 --> 53:00.306
I want to do it all, you know?

53:00.410 --> 53:02.901
Fucking beautiful. Take a bow, man.

53:04.414 --> 53:09.875
He was like, "I'm wearing a blue shirt
and I'm sad in my heart."

53:09.986 --> 53:11.613
I didn't think you were gonna do that!

53:11.721 --> 53:14.349
Okay! Cooker, you need to...

53:17.127 --> 53:18.958
Is that a thong you're wearing?

53:19.062 --> 53:21.326
What the fuck did you say?

53:21.431 --> 53:23.296
Do you have a thong on?

53:24.267 --> 53:26.326
Yeah, I'm wearing a thong.

53:27.704 --> 53:29.069
I'll get the sleeping bag.

53:40.817 --> 53:42.842
Dick, there any snakes in this shit,
or what?

53:42.953 --> 53:45.513
Don't worry about fucking snakes.

53:48.758 --> 53:50.385
Fuck you, dude.

53:51.895 --> 53:53.954
Shit, a porcupine.

54:10.247 --> 54:12.078
Hey. Hey!

54:12.182 --> 54:16.983
I think it stopped. I think it stopped.

54:17.087 --> 54:20.056
- Oh, God. This is insane.
- All right.

54:20.156 --> 54:23.922
No. It's gonna be okay, I think.
It's gonna be okay.

54:24.027 --> 54:27.724
Come on, let's just keep moving.
It'll be okay.

54:32.969 --> 54:35.631
- What the fuck was that?
- Just keep going. It's gonna be fine.

54:44.514 --> 54:46.004
- Come on.
- Hey, come on!

54:46.116 --> 54:48.448
Guys, guys, guys, just a monkey.
It's just a monkey.

54:48.551 --> 54:49.745
Jesus.

54:55.759 --> 54:58.023
- You guys!
- Oh, shit!

54:58.128 --> 55:02.394
I have been tracking you for hours.
Why did you leave me back there?

55:02.499 --> 55:05.627
Well, we thought you ran off
with Gus Hayden.

55:07.237 --> 55:09.467
You really think I'd do that?

55:09.572 --> 55:10.698
Yeah.

55:10.807 --> 55:11.831
Gross.

55:12.709 --> 55:16.475
I'd wanna fuck even you guys
before I'd wanna fuck him.

55:16.579 --> 55:18.240
- Hey.
- All right.

55:18.348 --> 55:20.441
You guys, I woke up
and he was stealing all our stuff,

55:20.550 --> 55:23.348
so I pretended like
I wanted to go with him

55:24.821 --> 55:28.814
and I convinced him to give me this.

55:30.160 --> 55:31.559
The map.

55:31.661 --> 55:33.720
You convinced him?

55:35.565 --> 55:37.999
What'd you have to do?

55:38.101 --> 55:40.592
Just a little something. Okay?

55:40.704 --> 55:42.899
I took one for the team.

55:44.641 --> 55:47.508
I have a map.

55:47.610 --> 55:50.408
- Me, too. I got a map.
- I got a bunch of maps.

55:50.513 --> 55:51.639
I have an atlas.

55:51.748 --> 55:56.685
I have some old Civil War maps
that are worth quite a bit.

55:56.786 --> 55:59.778
I have a map of the moon.
It's like... You can feel it.

55:59.889 --> 56:02.619
I got a whole map store.
Maps everywhere.

56:02.726 --> 56:04.591
If we get back to the RV,
I got a Thomas Guide.

56:04.694 --> 56:07.094
Like a hundred pages of maps.

56:07.197 --> 56:09.688
Come here, you guys!

56:09.799 --> 56:12.529
Just kidding. I don't have a map.

56:12.969 --> 56:17.565
I'll tell you, I will be damned.
I will just be damned.

56:17.674 --> 56:22.236
You know, with that map
and my jungle survival skills,

56:22.345 --> 56:24.939
just might be able
to help you find Bigfoot after all.

56:25.048 --> 56:26.208
Yeah!

56:26.316 --> 56:28.284
Dick! Dick! Dick!

56:30.754 --> 56:32.051
- We love Dick!
- Yes, we are.

56:32.155 --> 56:36.455
Yes, we are. First, though,
we gotta cross the Mohate River.

56:48.705 --> 56:50.400
We're almost there.

56:50.507 --> 56:53.340
Just straight that way.
Okay, you're doing great, Fred.

56:53.443 --> 56:55.911
- Thank you, thank you.
- You're doing great.

56:57.680 --> 57:01.411
- Cooker, I'm proud of you.
- Hey, Dick. I'm proud of you in turn.

57:01.518 --> 57:03.679
You're the best. You're the best.

57:04.487 --> 57:07.456
Now, I know a secret quick way through
this jungle,

57:07.557 --> 57:10.458
and we can get to the rocky cliffs
and maybe cut off Pierson.

57:10.560 --> 57:12.960
Now, here's what you're gonna do.

57:13.897 --> 57:15.660
What the... Oh, God!

57:19.936 --> 57:22.871
Don't come in here! No! Stay out!

57:25.074 --> 57:27.338
Oh, Dick!

57:27.444 --> 57:29.946
Here's another one
of those piranha bastards.

57:30.113 --> 57:32.513
Fucking eat all these fucking stupid fish.

57:32.615 --> 57:36.551
We were gonna make it,
and then these bastards ate Dick!

57:36.653 --> 57:39.315
- How's it feel to get eaten, fish fuckers?
- Yeah!

57:39.422 --> 57:42.448
- How's it feel to get eaten?
- Stupid... Stupid fish!

57:42.559 --> 57:46.359
You think we'd just let you get away
with eating Dick,

57:46.463 --> 57:49.364
you sons-of-bitches,
pieces of river trash!

57:49.466 --> 57:51.400
Fuck you! Fuck you!

57:52.635 --> 57:54.068
Hey, wait a minute.

57:55.772 --> 57:57.865
These are the fish that ate Dick, right?

57:57.974 --> 57:59.874
Yeah!

57:59.976 --> 58:01.876
All right, just go with me here.

58:01.978 --> 58:06.745
If Dick is in the fishes,
and we're eating the fishes,

58:06.850 --> 58:09.410
doesn't that mean we're eating Dick?

58:14.324 --> 58:15.814
What the fuck?

58:22.565 --> 58:25.500
- It's gonna be okay! Come on! Fred.
- No!

58:25.635 --> 58:28.297
Not one single thing has gone our way!

58:28.404 --> 58:32.363
And I guarantee you
Pierson found Bigfoot's cave days ago.

58:32.475 --> 58:35.069
Come on, Fred!
Don't be so negative, okay?

58:35.178 --> 58:38.636
Come on...
Our luck is gonna change, I can feel it.

58:38.748 --> 58:40.443
Oh, my God.

58:40.550 --> 58:44.111
You guys have to come with me.
I think I found something.

58:53.730 --> 58:57.689
- It's Pierson's team.
- Holy crap.

58:57.800 --> 58:59.768
Fred. Get over here, Fred.

58:59.869 --> 59:04.738
Mr. Wah I'm So Bummed Out.
Pierson's Gonna Find Bigfoot First...

59:04.841 --> 59:07.901
I don't think so, buddy!
Looks like our luck is changing.

59:08.011 --> 59:10.571
We came out on top! Come on!

59:14.984 --> 59:18.750
Oh, yeah. Oh, right. This is tragic.

59:21.624 --> 59:25.390
Amen. Okay,
let's gather up their equipment, guys.

59:26.696 --> 59:28.220
Sweet axe.

59:32.168 --> 59:37.470
<i>Gentle clouds of Nazareth</i>

59:37.574 --> 59:41.476
<i>Massacred in Ecuador</i>

59:41.578 --> 59:46.345
<i>Life's too fucking short</i>
<i>Ask that guy</i>

59:46.449 --> 59:49.475
Hey, that's Sky Pierson.

59:49.586 --> 59:51.850
- Oh, my God!
- Gaulke.

59:51.955 --> 59:53.354
- Hey.
- Gaulke.

59:53.456 --> 59:56.584
Hi, Sky. Wow, long time no see.

59:57.460 --> 59:58.654
So...

59:59.896 --> 01:00:03.332
I'm sorry. Sorry about that.
I just had some bad fish.

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:07.028
So, what happened here?

01:00:07.136 --> 01:00:08.433
Attacked.

01:00:10.239 --> 01:00:11.831
Coconga pygmies.

01:00:13.509 --> 01:00:14.737
Horrible.

01:00:16.579 --> 01:00:18.069
Hey, Sky,

01:00:19.215 --> 01:00:21.410
could you feel this?

01:00:21.517 --> 01:00:22.882
Dude.

01:00:22.986 --> 01:00:25.853
What are you poking him for, man?
The guy's dying.

01:00:25.955 --> 01:00:30.619
His upper half of his body
is not connected to his lower half.

01:00:30.727 --> 01:00:33.992
- Yeah, I know. Jesus Christ. What?
- Hey, Pete, Pete.

01:00:34.097 --> 01:00:37.498
You gonna punch him in the face
like Bill asked?

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:40.626
Oh, shit. Forgot about that.

01:00:43.973 --> 01:00:45.907
It's your call.

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:50.309
Oh, man. I don't know.
I'm kind of on the fence about it.

01:00:50.413 --> 01:00:53.075
It's not like he's in any position
to punch you back.

01:00:53.182 --> 01:00:55.343
Fred, it has nothing to do with fear.

01:00:55.451 --> 01:00:58.079
I mean, don't you think it's a little
excessive, punching him in the face?

01:00:58.187 --> 01:01:00.655
He's missing the lower half of his body.

01:01:00.757 --> 01:01:01.951
Gaulke.

01:01:03.459 --> 01:01:07.156
- Hey, we're back.
- Gaulke, you still here?

01:01:07.263 --> 01:01:08.730
Yeah, we're here.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.995
Hey, the cavalry has arrived.

01:01:17.073 --> 01:01:18.335
Sky.

01:01:22.545 --> 01:01:23.842
Oh, Sky.

01:01:25.715 --> 01:01:26.909
Let's go.

01:01:27.016 --> 01:01:29.382
Pick up what you can carry,
especially the camera equipment.

01:01:29.485 --> 01:01:31.248
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:11.018
See, I could've sworn
these are the markings!

01:02:11.127 --> 01:02:12.458
They're right there on the map.

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:16.225
Well, then, where the hell is the cave?
It says it's on the map, but it's not there!

01:02:16.332 --> 01:02:17.731
Hey, does anyone else
get the feeling that,

01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:19.995
like, we've been going in circles
for a while?

01:02:20.103 --> 01:02:24.597
Shit! Shit! Shit! Fucking shit!

01:02:25.842 --> 01:02:26.809
Shit!

01:02:29.345 --> 01:02:31.472
Fuck! Such a fuck up!

01:02:33.783 --> 01:02:36.718
Give me that fucking map!

01:02:36.819 --> 01:02:38.116
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:42.351
You said that Bill Calhoun
took a real picture of the map, right?

01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:44.653
Yeah, Pierson was holding it
in his hands.

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:47.559
Okay. Bill was using
two security cameras.

01:02:47.663 --> 01:02:52.157
It's a mirror image. Look at the "N".
The map got printed out backwards.

01:02:52.268 --> 01:02:53.860
Flip the picture.

01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:57.872
Cheryl, you are a genius!

01:02:58.975 --> 01:03:01.443
Okay, so wait.
So all the directions are reversed.

01:03:01.544 --> 01:03:05.480
So then that means
that the cave is not here.

01:03:05.581 --> 01:03:08.880
It's gonna be over, around here.
Come on, let's go!

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:20.285
That's it.

01:03:20.396 --> 01:03:22.489
That's the cave. It's gotta be. Map.

01:03:22.598 --> 01:03:25.066
See? Turn the map.

01:03:25.168 --> 01:03:29.366
Rock formation fits with the hill.
That cave is his cave.

01:03:44.287 --> 01:03:46.482
How do we know he's in there?

01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:49.023
I can feel him. Okay, come on.

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:52.959
We're gonna move closer,
but stealthily, like that of a cheetah.

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:10.607
Oh, my God, I can hear him.
He's in there. Holy God. Okay.

01:04:10.713 --> 01:04:15.047
This is probably the most important
wildlife discovery of our time,

01:04:15.151 --> 01:04:17.415
and we're gonna chronicle it.

01:04:19.222 --> 01:04:20.382
Okay.

01:04:21.424 --> 01:04:23.790
Okay, over there. Cross, cross.

01:04:25.027 --> 01:04:26.324
This is crazy.

01:04:26.662 --> 01:04:28.357
Okay, set up the camera.

01:04:28.464 --> 01:04:31.331
Okay, listen up.
Here's what's gonna happen.

01:04:31.434 --> 01:04:33.868
I'm gonna do an intro throw announce,

01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:36.029
and then we're gonna
slowly steal inside

01:04:36.138 --> 01:04:38.698
and catch this amazing creature
in his natural habitat, okay?

01:04:38.808 --> 01:04:40.207
Okay, ready?

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:43.938
Oh, remember. Okay, listen. Junior!

01:04:44.046 --> 01:04:45.377
- Listen.
- I am.

01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:48.109
Do not spook him, okay?

01:04:48.217 --> 01:04:51.709
He is probably very,
very frightened of us.

01:04:51.821 --> 01:04:54.312
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:04:54.423 --> 01:04:55.947
I got sound if you wanna go.

01:04:56.058 --> 01:04:57.423
Ready, rolling.

01:04:57.526 --> 01:05:01.860
And five, four, three, two, one, zero.
Talking now.

01:05:03.132 --> 01:05:07.364
Hi. I'm Peter Gaulke,
and this is <i>Strange Wilderness.</i>

01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:13.067
Camped here, waiting to film Bigfoot.

01:05:13.175 --> 01:05:15.473
That's right, you heard me, Bigfoot.

01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:18.843
Animals have long been known
as animals, not human,

01:05:18.948 --> 01:05:25.376
and have been described as stupid,
cowardly, aggressive, dimwitted,

01:05:27.189 --> 01:05:32.752
low beasts, eager to kill, eager to eat,
eager to fornicate,

01:05:32.862 --> 01:05:37.128
eager to stampede all...

01:05:37.233 --> 01:05:40.896
But is it animals we describe,
or is it mankind?

01:05:42.672 --> 01:05:47.109
Perhaps this Bigfoot creature can
bridge the divide between us and them.

01:05:47.209 --> 01:05:50.701
Perhaps his gentle ways can teach us,
remind us

01:05:50.813 --> 01:05:56.479
that peace and harmony
are necessary if mankind is to survive.

01:05:56.585 --> 01:05:58.143
What?

01:05:58.254 --> 01:05:59.516
Oh, fuck!

01:06:26.182 --> 01:06:27.149
Hey...

01:06:28.117 --> 01:06:32.747
Does anybody remember what that
big bastard said before he came at us?

01:06:35.925 --> 01:06:41.761
I think he said, "Huh?"
Like he wasn't sure what was going on.

01:06:41.864 --> 01:06:45.197
- No. It was more of a growl.
- Yeah, totally.

01:06:45.301 --> 01:06:47.826
Actually, you know what?
It was more like a death growl.

01:06:47.937 --> 01:06:52.374
It was like, "I'm gonna kill you."
I mean, I heard that.

01:06:52.475 --> 01:06:54.340
- Yeah, no, I did, too. Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:06:54.443 --> 01:06:56.070
I heard it, too.

01:06:57.313 --> 01:07:00.373
- Didn't I?
- Yeah. No. Oh, yeah.

01:07:00.483 --> 01:07:02.110
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- That's what he said, man.

01:07:02.218 --> 01:07:05.710
I've just, you know,
I've just never killed anything before.

01:07:05.821 --> 01:07:07.413
But it was in self-defense, so...

01:07:07.523 --> 01:07:09.115
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. The lady's right.

01:07:09.225 --> 01:07:14.026
This mythological beast
was engineered by the French.

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:17.793
Fuck, I was so blind to not see it before.

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:21.131
It was designed by the French
in the early '50s

01:07:21.237 --> 01:07:25.697
to fuck and eventually
kill American people.

01:07:25.808 --> 01:07:30.643
He would've come
and fucking killed all of us.

01:07:30.746 --> 01:07:31.804
You know what?

01:07:31.914 --> 01:07:34.212
Like, if a mosquito is buzzing
around your ear, do you let it go?

01:07:34.316 --> 01:07:36.978
Like, "Keep on bothering me
and, like, sting me

01:07:37.086 --> 01:07:38.280
"and let me get West Nile Virus?"

01:07:38.387 --> 01:07:41.447
No, you fucking smack it, like we did.

01:07:41.557 --> 01:07:43.684
Only we did it with guns.

01:07:43.793 --> 01:07:45.920
- I don't know, guys. I mean...
- What?

01:07:47.129 --> 01:07:48.426
Well, I mean...

01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:51.690
- Fuck him, right?
- Yeah.

01:07:51.801 --> 01:07:55.760
That prick deserved to die, right?
Big, hairy, carnivore son-of-a-bitch.

01:07:55.871 --> 01:07:59.238
You see the way he came at us,
all up in our face and all...

01:07:59.341 --> 01:08:01.172
Fucking fuck you, you fuck.

01:08:01.277 --> 01:08:02.835
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:07.678
Fucking cocktease.

01:08:12.988 --> 01:08:16.856
But, you know, I've been thinking.

01:08:16.959 --> 01:08:21.520
Maybe it's not the best way
to end our show, though?

01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:25.497
You know, actually killing Bigfoot?

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:27.126
Yeah.

01:08:27.236 --> 01:08:30.103
Probably not gonna fly
with the TV station.

01:08:32.041 --> 01:08:35.067
Peter, I have a little idea.

01:08:45.787 --> 01:08:47.813
Those sharks
ate the living shit out of me,

01:08:47.923 --> 01:08:51.290
like my leg was a fucking piece of corn
on the cob with butter on it.

01:08:51.393 --> 01:08:53.486
I was yelling at them
that I wasn't no seal.

01:08:53.595 --> 01:08:55.029
"Hey, it's me, Danny-boy!"

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:57.429
But they didn't understand
my human language.

01:08:57.533 --> 01:08:59.228
So I got this fake leg now.

01:08:59.335 --> 01:09:01.826
The doc comes in my room,
and he asks me what kind I want.

01:09:01.937 --> 01:09:03.029
What the fuck?

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:05.403
It turns out he's talking about
the wood or some shit.

01:09:05.508 --> 01:09:07.669
Mahogany, pine, or balsa?

01:09:07.776 --> 01:09:11.041
So, that gets me thinking,
"I should put a jackhammer on there,

01:09:11.147 --> 01:09:15.379
"so when I walk up the sidewalk
I could bust up the cement."

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:17.747
Okay. All right, listen up, everybody.

01:09:17.853 --> 01:09:21.812
We're gonna have him eating out
of our hands when he sees this. This.

01:09:21.924 --> 01:09:24.256
The television show of the century, huh?

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:25.587
Yeah.

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:26.921
- Bring it.
- Let's do it.

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:28.326
- High five!
- Good luck.

01:09:29.465 --> 01:09:33.060
<i>We were all shivering with excitement</i>
<i>as we carefully moved in</i>

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:37.606
<i>for the first ever contact</i>
<i>with the legendary Bigfoot.</i>

01:09:37.706 --> 01:09:40.573
<i>What we found inside the cave</i>
<i>shocked us all.</i>

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:44.077
<i>Apparently, the Bigfoot</i>
<i>had been experiencing depression</i>

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:45.613
<i>and hung himself.</i>

01:09:45.714 --> 01:09:48.911
<i>Forced to live like an animal</i>
<i>in a cold dark cave,</i>

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:52.350
<i>I imagine any one of us</i>
<i>would've done the same thing.</i>

01:09:52.453 --> 01:09:54.854
<i>Unlike that dude on fire</i>
<i>at the peace rally,</i>

01:09:54.957 --> 01:09:57.858
<i>we sprung into action</i>
<i>to revive the Bigfoot.</i>

01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.621
<i>But it was too late.</i>

01:09:59.728 --> 01:10:02.595
<i>It made me feel so crappy.</i>

01:10:02.698 --> 01:10:07.192
<i>And so ended our fantastic adventure,</i>
<i>"The Search for Bigfoot."</i>

01:10:07.303 --> 01:10:10.170
<i>Join us next week</i>
<i>for a show about beavers.</i>

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.237
Are you insane?

01:10:13.342 --> 01:10:15.742
Did someone drop a safe on your head?

01:10:15.844 --> 01:10:18.312
That's the craziest shit I've ever seen!

01:10:18.414 --> 01:10:20.746
- Hey, quit shoving me, man!
- Yeah, what's that?

01:10:20.849 --> 01:10:23.010
Man, you've been a dick since day one!

01:10:23.118 --> 01:10:26.019
- Yeah? Fuck you!
- Get out, assholes!

01:10:26.121 --> 01:10:27.554
- Fuck you, Judy.
- Yeah.

01:10:27.656 --> 01:10:29.419
You know what? This is all because of
you and your stupid idea

01:10:29.525 --> 01:10:31.686
about faking Bigfoot's suicide.

01:10:31.794 --> 01:10:34.820
You know, I should've never listened...
I should've never hired you!

01:10:34.930 --> 01:10:37.956
That's the most un-American thing
I've ever heard in my life.

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:39.625
Excuse me, could you keep it down?

01:10:39.735 --> 01:10:43.068
Hey, sweetheart, we're having
a private company meeting here.

01:10:43.172 --> 01:10:44.469
So why don't you keep it down, okay?

01:10:44.573 --> 01:10:46.905
Hey, hey, we're in the middle
of a fucking conversation,

01:10:47.009 --> 01:10:48.567
you turn around to hit on some chick.

01:10:48.677 --> 01:10:51.908
Hey, why you all up in my waist, man?
You feeling froggy, huh?

01:10:52.014 --> 01:10:54.346
- Why don't you take a leap?
- I can't. That's fucked up.

01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:56.577
You shouldn't talk to someone like that.

01:10:56.685 --> 01:11:00.416
You stone-wasted half-man party punk!
Shut the...

01:11:00.789 --> 01:11:04.156
Whoa, seriously, man. Come on,
he's pathetic. Take it easy on him.

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:08.253
Fuck you, Cheech.
You suck as a soundman, dude.

01:11:08.364 --> 01:11:12.027
You stupid fuck. Go buy some sandals.
Go buy some sandals.

01:11:12.134 --> 01:11:15.399
You want to fight? I'll fight your fight.
I haven't fought in 10 years.

01:11:15.504 --> 01:11:16.971
I'm fighting tonight.

01:11:18.574 --> 01:11:21.702
What you got? What you got?
Let's see. Throw down, bitch.

01:11:24.013 --> 01:11:25.241
Throw down, bitch.

01:11:25.347 --> 01:11:27.747
Hey, you know what? He's right, Fred!

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:29.340
You suck as a soundman, okay...

01:11:29.451 --> 01:11:31.316
All right, that's it. I'm calling security.

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:33.320
Oh, no, honey,
you are not calling security.

01:11:33.422 --> 01:11:35.287
- You understand me?
- Hey! Hey!

01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:56.507
And that is the whole ridiculous story.

01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:02.880
No, I haven't seen anybody in,
like, over a year.

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:04.646
You know, things were said.

01:12:04.753 --> 01:12:07.551
I think they're a lot better off
without me around anyway.

01:12:07.656 --> 01:12:10.784
I'm such a failure. Oh, shit.

01:12:10.893 --> 01:12:13.191
Hey, thanks for listening, okay?

01:12:13.295 --> 01:12:15.923
I'll talk to you tomorrow. Great. Bye.

01:12:17.366 --> 01:12:18.799
Nobody's home!

01:12:23.572 --> 01:12:24.596
Pete.

01:12:24.707 --> 01:12:27.505
You know
when you yell out "Nobody's home,"

01:12:27.609 --> 01:12:29.907
people know you're home
because otherwise

01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:33.209
who the hell would be yelling out
"Nobody's home."

01:12:35.718 --> 01:12:37.185
Brought out a smile.

01:12:39.455 --> 01:12:42.549
Well, you won't return my calls,

01:12:42.658 --> 01:12:46.185
so I thought I'd personally
hand-deliver a hello.

01:12:46.295 --> 01:12:49.492
No, I just couldn't hold it all together.

01:12:50.566 --> 01:12:52.431
You know what I've always been
wanting to tell you,

01:12:52.534 --> 01:12:54.900
all the times you have
beaten yourself up...

01:12:56.105 --> 01:12:59.597
Times were different then. It was easier.

01:12:59.708 --> 01:13:01.039
You know something?

01:13:01.143 --> 01:13:03.577
Your old man
could never have survived today.

01:13:03.679 --> 01:13:05.647
I loved your dad, you know that,

01:13:05.748 --> 01:13:09.275
but he didn't have the tenacity
and the heart that you have.

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:12.320
You were born into a wildlife family.

01:13:12.421 --> 01:13:17.586
Like your old man used to say,
"All it takes is one good idea."

01:13:17.693 --> 01:13:20.218
Yeah, he used to always say that.

01:13:20.329 --> 01:13:23.093
With one good idea
anything can happen.

01:13:23.198 --> 01:13:27.430
- But it's up to you.
- Yeah.

01:13:27.536 --> 01:13:29.128
What do you say?

01:13:30.606 --> 01:13:32.699
I say, "Let's do it."

01:13:32.808 --> 01:13:36.335
- Pete Gaulke's back!
- Yeah. Right.

01:13:36.445 --> 01:13:39.471
You know what? Thanks, man.
I mean, I really get...

01:13:39.581 --> 01:13:41.947
- Hey, do you mind if I tap a bowl first?
- Go ahead.

01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:44.450
You know, because... Where's it?

01:13:44.553 --> 01:13:46.987
You know,
I have a bunch of great ideas,

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:49.956
and they seem like great ideas
for about 10 minutes,

01:13:50.058 --> 01:13:53.186
and then I'm sitting here for a while
and all of a sudden they seem stale.

01:13:53.295 --> 01:13:56.526
And then I forget about them,
I don't write them down anymore...

01:13:56.632 --> 01:14:01.331
I mean, I think what I need to do is
really kind of...

01:14:06.909 --> 01:14:11.243
Oh, God. That little guy is gonna think
he's a shark.

01:14:11.346 --> 01:14:12.404
Hey, wait a minute.

01:14:12.514 --> 01:14:14.709
What a hell of an idea for a show.

01:14:14.817 --> 01:14:17.786
A show about sharks, huh?

01:14:17.886 --> 01:14:19.877
- One good idea.
- Good idea!

01:14:19.988 --> 01:14:21.785
Yeah, buddy!

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:22.857
All right.

01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:27.361
<i>Hot Dog Hell, can I help you?</i>

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:31.695
<i>Yeah, I need six hotdogs,</i>
<i>I need six cokes,</i>

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:35.531
<i>and the best damn soundman</i>
<i>in the business.</i>

01:14:35.637 --> 01:14:38.173
I need Fred Wolf's ass in this car now.

01:14:38.173 --> 01:14:38.400
I need Fred Wolf's ass in this car now.

01:14:38.507 --> 01:14:41.340
<i>Pete! Holy shit, man. You know what?</i>

01:14:41.443 --> 01:14:42.842
<i>I've been going through it in my head.</i>

01:14:42.945 --> 01:14:45.072
<i>Fifty different ways</i>
<i>on how to apologize to you</i>

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:46.875
<i>for what I said that day, man.</i>

01:14:46.982 --> 01:14:49.507
We're all sorry
about all the stuff we said.

01:14:49.618 --> 01:14:52.018
<i>Hey, man, the world keeps turning,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:54.611
<i>Hey, dads may die</i>
<i>and you may miss him every day,</i>

01:14:54.723 --> 01:14:56.350
<i>but you still have your friends.</i>

01:14:56.458 --> 01:14:58.619
<i>That was beautiful, man. Take a bow.</i>

01:15:00.062 --> 01:15:01.393
<i>Asshole!</i>

01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:03.965
Why are they using such bad language?

01:15:04.066 --> 01:15:06.660
<i>Yeah, I called Lawson,</i>
<i>and he was mad at first.</i>

01:15:06.768 --> 01:15:10.727
<i>He said, Bigfoot thing</i>
<i>was the craziest thing he ever saw.</i>

01:15:10.839 --> 01:15:14.138
<i>Well, then he never saw R. Kelly's</i>
Trapped in a Fucking Closet!

01:15:14.243 --> 01:15:16.837
<i>But he said</i>
<i>if we could get a shark attack on film,</i>

01:15:16.945 --> 01:15:18.742
<i>he'd put us back on the air.</i>

01:15:22.985 --> 01:15:25.317
<i>So get in the fucking car and let's go!</i>

01:15:29.324 --> 01:15:30.313
Get in there!

01:15:39.001 --> 01:15:40.992
Excuse me. I didn't say... Hey, hey, hey!

01:15:41.904 --> 01:15:43.599
Hi, Ed, how are you?

01:15:43.705 --> 01:15:46.572
We got a shark episode
with a shark attack.

01:15:49.344 --> 01:15:53.178
<i>Hi, I'm Peter Gaulke</i>
<i>and this is</i> Strange Wilderness.

01:15:53.282 --> 01:15:56.809
<i>The ocean. Many words</i>
<i>have been used to describe it.</i>

01:15:56.919 --> 01:15:59.353
<i>And now you can add one more.</i>
<i>Dangerous.</i>

01:15:59.454 --> 01:16:01.615
<i>Why? The shark.</i>

01:16:01.723 --> 01:16:03.520
<i>It was one year ago today,</i>

01:16:03.625 --> 01:16:07.083
that Danny was brutally attacked
on this very spot

01:16:07.195 --> 01:16:09.686
by one of these killing machines.

01:16:10.632 --> 01:16:16.332
In today's show, we'll be taking
a close look at this mysterious creature

01:16:16.438 --> 01:16:20.033
that should be named
"the asshole of the sea."

01:16:20.642 --> 01:16:22.473
<i>Menacing and terrifying,</i>

01:16:22.578 --> 01:16:27.242
<i>the shark has been menacing</i>
<i>and terrifying for over a decade.</i>

01:16:27.349 --> 01:16:30.648
<i>Sharks can only be found</i>
<i>in two places on earth,</i>

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:34.017
<i>the Northern</i>
<i>and Southern Hemispheres.</i>

01:16:34.122 --> 01:16:39.059
<i>This shark is called a Hammerhead</i>
<i>because his head looks like a hammer.</i>

01:16:39.161 --> 01:16:41.527
<i>These sharks</i>
<i>are attacking Nicole Richie.</i>

01:16:43.865 --> 01:16:46.834
<i>Yes, the shark is a... What the fuck!</i>

01:16:46.935 --> 01:16:49.699
<i>Look at that thing's teeth.</i>

01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:15.196
Okay, you guys ready?

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:17.993
I've never been more ready
in my fucking life.

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:21.092
It's like that shark was gnawing on me
like a rawhide stick.

01:17:21.203 --> 01:17:22.500
- This one's for you, Danny.
- How old are those?

01:17:22.604 --> 01:17:24.003
Three weeks old.

01:17:25.941 --> 01:17:27.272
For you, Danny.

01:17:28.710 --> 01:17:30.371
<i>Oh, my God, it's gonna come up.</i>

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:31.878
<i>Give me that shit.</i>

01:17:36.385 --> 01:17:39.183
All right, let's do this.
Fred, lower the steak.

01:17:39.287 --> 01:17:41.380
All right, come on. Let's do this.

01:17:42.391 --> 01:17:44.325
That's him. That's that same fucker.

01:17:44.426 --> 01:17:46.087
There's a fin. I see a fin.

01:17:46.194 --> 01:17:47.627
- I see it, too.
- Hey, shark!

01:17:47.729 --> 01:17:50.892
We got something for you,
you fucking asshole!

01:17:52.434 --> 01:17:53.867
Oh, my God, he's...

01:17:58.073 --> 01:17:59.734
That was awesome.

01:18:01.810 --> 01:18:05.177
Fuck you, motherfucker!
How did that shit taste?

01:18:10.318 --> 01:18:11.808
<i>That did it.</i>

01:18:13.221 --> 01:18:14.415
Pete...

01:18:15.490 --> 01:18:17.890
Pete, people love shark attacks.

01:18:17.993 --> 01:18:20.896
Besides, Pierson's dead,
so you're back on the air.

01:18:20.896 --> 01:18:21.123
Besides, Pierson's dead,
so you're back on the air.

01:18:26.034 --> 01:18:28.002
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
