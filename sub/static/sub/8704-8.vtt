that Jack was not there,

15:58.213 --> 15:59.746
that she had been crossed

15:59.747 --> 16:02.012
and that she would likely
never see him again,

16:02.013 --> 16:04.212
she would attempt to kill anyone

16:04.213 --> 16:06.012
she deemed responsible.

16:06.013 --> 16:08.646
Eight?

16:08.647 --> 16:11.012
You could have sent a thousand men.

16:11.013 --> 16:13.012
It would not have deterred her.

16:13.013 --> 16:14.112
And now you are saying to me

16:14.113 --> 16:16.112
that she knew she had been crossed

16:16.113 --> 16:19.479
and chose to walk away to save herself?

16:47.080 --> 16:48.679
A little.

16:48.680 --> 16:50.579
- You?
- Hardly at all.

16:50.580 --> 16:52.879
If I'm in Havana in a day or two,

16:52.880 --> 16:55.579
I assume I'll be hearing a lot of it...

16:55.580 --> 16:58.379
shouted by bitter old women in a crowd,

16:58.380 --> 17:02.579
growled by angry officials.

17:02.580 --> 17:06.179
It seems a rotten thing
to wish upon anyone,

17:06.180 --> 17:10.878
an unflattering eulogy
in an unfamiliar town.

17:10.880 --> 17:11.912
It'll be quick,

17:11.913 --> 17:15.112
to whatever extent it
sets your mind at ease.

17:15.113 --> 17:17.112
The gold is theirs.

17:17.113 --> 17:19.112
The gems are theirs.

17:19.113 --> 17:20.811
They don't need anything
from you anymore,

17:20.813 --> 17:22.212
and as such they're likely to want

17:22.213 --> 17:26.213
to put the entire affair
behind them and move on.

17:28.613 --> 17:30.579
I'm sorry. "If"?

17:30.580 --> 17:32.679
Beg pardon?

17:32.680 --> 17:35.812
You said, "If I'm in Havana."

17:35.813 --> 17:37.805
In your mind this
outcome is still in doubt.

17:39.413 --> 17:44.279
Well, the odds are
certainly in its favor,

17:45.412 --> 17:48.178
but it is by no means a certainty.

17:48.179 --> 17:50.911
How so exactly?

17:50.912 --> 17:53.211
You said Anne is alive, did you not?

17:53.212 --> 17:55.011
I would argue as long as that is true,

17:55.012 --> 17:57.511
there's a chance, however remote,

17:57.512 --> 17:59.011
that she will frustrate your efforts

17:59.012 --> 18:00.811
to send me off to my death.

18:00.812 --> 18:02.411
Out of curiosity,

18:02.412 --> 18:03.678
how would she go about doing that?

18:03.679 --> 18:05.279
Well, I have no idea.

18:07.012 --> 18:08.911
Everything and anything
in her power, I imagine,

18:08.912 --> 18:10.144

18:10.145 --> 18:11.844
in the middle of the road ahead of us

18:11.845 --> 18:13.344
to be run over by your horses

18:13.345 --> 18:16.845
in the hope of slowing
you down for even a moment.

18:20.145 --> 18:22.844
It is fascinating to me

18:22.845 --> 18:24.644
how stubbornly you people expect

18:24.645 --> 18:28.311
the unlikeliest of outcomes
because you prefer them.

18:28.312 --> 18:30.644
You expect the world to
become what you want it to be

18:30.645 --> 18:34.111
despite all available evidence
and experience to the contrary.

18:34.112 --> 18:39.044
This was not the way I'd hoped
this affair would play out.

18:39.045 --> 18:40.211
But I can assure you

18:40.212 --> 18:41.211
it is most certainly
not going to play out

18:41.212 --> 18:43.711
the way you hope it will either,

18:43.712 --> 18:46.411
because even to stand
in the road ahead of us,

18:46.412 --> 18:48.544
she would have to know
which road to stand in.

18:48.545 --> 18:51.111
You held the route secret.

18:51.112 --> 18:53.711
I held a number of
potential routes secret

18:53.712 --> 18:56.711
before settling upon this one

18:56.712 --> 18:59.111
so that even if the
secrets were compromised,

18:59.112 --> 19:01.611
anyone intending to hit us
would be more than likely

19:01.612 --> 19:05.178
in possession of the wrong route.

19:14.212 --> 19:17.378
CHAMBERLAIN: Let me be
sure I have this right.

19:17.379 --> 19:19.878
So the plan to recover
the stolen cache of gems...

19:19.879 --> 19:22.378
your plan to recover
the stolen cache of gems

19:22.379 --> 19:25.111
has worked in exactly the
manner you suggested it would.

19:25.112 --> 19:28.378
Only now you believe
this is a bad thing...

19:28.379 --> 19:30.378
evidence of a plan to rescue Mr. Rackham

19:30.379 --> 19:33.478
and once again recover
the cache of gems.

19:33.479 --> 19:34.944
That is what you're suggesting, yes?

19:34.945 --> 19:37.178
I can understand why this
may be hard to believe,

19:37.179 --> 19:38.878
but I know Anne Bonny well enough

19:38.879 --> 19:41.978
to know that it is a certainty
something here is amiss.

19:41.979 --> 19:43.878
That her behavior should coincide

19:43.879 --> 19:45.478
with the presence of
Captain Flint on the island

19:45.479 --> 19:46.978
only hours before

19:46.979 --> 19:48.711
most certainly points
to a plot being underway.

19:48.712 --> 19:50.478
I beg your pardon.

19:50.479 --> 19:52.878
So now Captain Flint is
somehow involved in this plot

19:52.879 --> 19:55.478
despite the fact that his
ship left the island hours ago?

19:55.479 --> 19:59.378
And I am to redeploy men into the
interior away from Nassau Town,

19:59.379 --> 20:00.978
leaving their positions undefended?

20:00.979 --> 20:02.378
I'm sorry, are you suggesting

20:02.379 --> 20:04.378
there's some ulterior motive here?

20:04.379 --> 20:06.678
I'm suggesting that
simply because the governor

20:06.679 --> 20:09.678
decided to put his... trust in you,

20:09.679 --> 20:11.844
I have no intention of doing the same.

20:11.845 --> 20:12.978
The situation is well in hand.

Thank you for your concern.

20:14.112 --> 20:15.978
Well in hand?

20:15.979 --> 20:17.111
I'm telling you the
situation is potentially

20:17.112 --> 20:18.878

Even if somebody wanted to move
against the governor's caravan,

20:26.179 --> 20:29.178
they wouldn't know where to
find the governor's caravan.

20:29.179 --> 20:30.678
The route was altered multiple times.

20:30.679 --> 20:31.878
False schedules were distributed.

20:31.879 --> 20:33.478
Nobody knows exactly when
they were set to leave.

they finally decided upon.

- MAX: I know.

That is it, is it not?

20:48.877 --> 20:50.676

20:50.677 --> 20:52.243
to scout the decoy routes?

20:54.177 --> 20:57.110
Did you tell anyone what
your boy has told you?

20:57.111 --> 20:59.676
No. And would your boy

20:59.677 --> 21:02.576
sell his information
without your knowledge?

21:02.577 --> 21:05.376
No. Good.

to fucking worry about.

21:34.311 --> 21:36.443

neighbors were kind enough

29:06.276 --> 29:09.475
to whisper them rather
than call them out loud.

29:09.476 --> 29:11.608

what had been taken away.

but I was determined...

29:19.109 --> 29:21.908
... until a man arrived at my door

29:21.909 --> 29:25.308

belonging to my father.

now belonged to me.

have hoped to repay.

29:34.309 --> 29:37.608

would have seen me imprisoned...

29:37.609 --> 29:40.074

debts would have been discharged

29:40.075 --> 29:42.074
only through hard labor.

45:39.293 --> 45:41.459
urging you to resume petty rivalries

45:41.460 --> 45:46.359
and repeat the costliest
of your mistakes,

45:46.360 --> 45:48.459
preventing you from ever
truly moving into the future

45:48.460 --> 45:50.659
I wanted to build here

45:50.660 --> 45:52.359
rather than gravitating
back into your past.

45:52.360 --> 45:55.459
And now...

45:55.460 --> 45:59.159
in the moment I need you the most,

45:59.160 --> 46:03.459
need the best of you the most,

46:03.460 --> 46:05.159
I fear the temptation you are feeling

46:05.160 --> 46:07.026
is about to be at its strongest.

46:09.160 --> 46:10.592
You're wrong. No, I'm not wro...

46:10.593 --> 46:14.726
[coughs]

46:14.727 --> 46:17.460
[coughs, inhales]

46:20.427 --> 46:22.127
I am not wrong.

46:25.427 --> 46:30.093
That man sitting in a cell in my fort

46:30.627 --> 46:32.626
is the embodiment of
that temptation for you.

46:32.627 --> 46:33.859
It is self-evident.

46:33.860 --> 46:38.226
Now, I am asking whether you're able

46:38.227 --> 46:42.759
to see past the petty and the personal

46:42.760 --> 46:44.192
to remain focused on what is right now

46:44.193 --> 46:48.292
of vital importance to
both of our futures...

46:48.293 --> 46:49.992
to our very survival.

46:49.993 --> 46:53.492
If you have any regard for me,

46:53.493 --> 46:56.792
any respect at all,

46:56.793 --> 46:59.292
then I'm asking you to tell me the truth

46:59.293 --> 47:01.693
about what you're capable of right now.

47:08.493 --> 47:10.192
The moment you walked
into my cell in London,

47:10.193 --> 47:12.060
do you want to know
what I first thought?

47:15.260 --> 47:18.059
I wasn't thinking about
the charges against me.

47:18.060 --> 47:21.059
I wasn't thinking about
a reprieve from the noose.

47:21.060 --> 47:22.559
I wasn't thinking about piracy,

47:22.560 --> 47:25.059
nor pardons, nor Nassau.

47:25.060 --> 47:28.893
In that moment, I was consumed by
one thought and one thought only...

47:33.060 --> 47:35.759
... the idea that this
may be my opportunity

47:35.760 --> 47:37.426
to gain some measure of revenge

47:37.427 --> 47:40.059
against my father's murderer,

47:40.060 --> 47:44.893
that I might play a role in
the execution of Charles Vane.

47:45.193 --> 47:48.292
I know you now. I trust you now.

47:48.293 --> 47:50.958
I'm devoted to you now.

47:50.959 --> 47:52.425
I love you now.

47:56.093 --> 47:59.292
So I will tell you the absolute truth

47:59.293 --> 48:01.592
about how I'm going to react
when faced with the thing

48:01.593 --> 48:04.193
sitting in that cell in your fort.

48:09.093 --> 48:10.626
I honestly don't know.
