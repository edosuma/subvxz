[laughter and applause]

08:59.825 --> 09:00.628
Now do Shrimp.

09:00.630 --> 09:01.805
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

09:01.807 --> 09:04.628
♪ There's a lifeguard named
Shrimp here at the pool ♪

09:04.630 --> 09:06.166
all: ♪ At the pool ♪

09:06.168 --> 09:11.232
It's like a duet between
Taylor Swift and Katy Perry.

09:11.234 --> 09:13.765
Oh, come on, everyone knows they have beef.

09:13.767 --> 09:15.290
Maybe this was a mistake.

09:15.292 --> 09:17.829
A bunch of strangers drinking
alcohol in their bathing suits

09:17.831 --> 09:19.535
is kind of my worst nightmare.

09:19.537 --> 09:21.194
Don't be shy.

09:21.196 --> 09:24.532
A party's like a pool:
you just gotta jump in!

09:24.534 --> 09:27.006
Somebody grab these two a beer!

09:27.008 --> 09:28.477
[whispers] Crap, what do we do?

09:30.253 --> 09:32.964
Liam, Amy, what are you doing here?

09:32.966 --> 09:34.280
No way!

09:34.282 --> 09:37.034
You two are friends with Stingray?

09:37.036 --> 09:38.810
Has he always had these perfect nipples?

09:38.812 --> 09:40.994
- [chuckles nervously]
- Here you go.

09:40.996 --> 09:44.723
Guys, this is Dylan. AKA Sharkskin.

09:44.725 --> 09:46.829
He moved here this summer from Hawaii.

09:46.831 --> 09:49.262
Filled with the spirit of Aloha.

09:49.264 --> 09:51.367
So are you guys dating?

09:51.369 --> 09:54.826
- I wish! Look at that blowhole!
- [laughs]

09:54.828 --> 09:57.460
But sadly my shark don't swim that way.

09:57.462 --> 09:58.181
Yeah.

09:58.183 --> 10:00.669
I've been cursed with a
terminal case of heterosexuality,

10:00.671 --> 10:04.174
and this little lady is the only
thing that makes it bearable.

10:07.494 --> 10:08.928
[wolf whistles]

10:12.767 --> 10:14.039
- Don't be silly.
- Thanks.

10:14.041 --> 10:15.020
I didn't invite you because I know

10:15.022 --> 10:17.181
a bunch of strangers drinking
alcohol in bathing suits

10:17.183 --> 10:21.309
- is your worst nightmare.
- Was.

10:21.311 --> 10:25.032
But now I love parties. They're my jam.

10:25.034 --> 10:26.788
I've evolved this summer.

10:26.790 --> 10:28.542
Which is why I'm here.

10:28.544 --> 10:30.074
With Liam.

10:30.076 --> 10:32.072
How crazy we both
befriended former enemies.

10:32.074 --> 10:33.311
Oh, no, we're not friends.

10:33.313 --> 10:35.873
He was just my ride here.

10:35.875 --> 10:37.245
You're not...

10:37.247 --> 10:38.929
Jealous? [laughs]

10:38.931 --> 10:40.262
I evolved this summer too.

10:40.264 --> 10:43.826
I'm dating a guy who looks
better in a sarong than I do.

10:43.828 --> 10:45.737
Why didn't you mention him earlier?

10:45.739 --> 10:47.069
Because I was at work.

10:47.071 --> 10:48.803
And I knew it might bring
up some feelings for you

10:48.805 --> 10:51.354
and wouldn't want you to
have to skip town again.

10:51.356 --> 10:53.823
But that's the thing, I don't
have those feelings anymore.

10:53.825 --> 10:58.938
After a summer apart, I am 100% over you!

10:58.940 --> 10:59.924
Yay.

10:59.926 --> 11:02.001
Now we can get back on track.

11:02.003 --> 11:02.897
Isn't this great news?

11:02.899 --> 11:05.372
The greatest. But, uh...

11:05.374 --> 11:06.662
It'll have to wait.

11:06.664 --> 11:08.959
Tonight's the last lifeguard
party of the summer.

11:08.961 --> 11:13.710
You're welcome to stay, but please
don't be upset if I'm not there for you.

11:13.712 --> 11:15.245
[scoffs]

11:15.247 --> 11:18.146
I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself.

11:18.148 --> 11:21.157
I know. It's all good.

11:22.649 --> 11:24.106
I was going to tell you about Dylan.

11:24.108 --> 11:26.171
I was just easing you into it.

11:26.173 --> 11:28.790
You said yourself, it's hard
to watch your exes move on.

11:28.792 --> 11:30.884
I'm not jealous. I'm
glad she's found someone.

11:30.886 --> 11:34.430
I'm just surprised you
guys are such good buddies.

11:34.432 --> 11:35.706
We're not.

11:35.708 --> 11:37.971
We're just, you know, work friends.

11:37.973 --> 11:40.664
Soon to be school friends
since he's starting at Hester.

11:40.666 --> 11:44.650
But don't worry, I am still
the captain of Team Liam.

11:44.652 --> 11:45.929
I'm not worried.

11:45.931 --> 11:47.603
In fact, I barely heard
anything you just said

11:47.605 --> 11:50.751
because I'm so distracted
by those hot perfect nipples.

11:50.753 --> 11:53.508
[laughs]

11:53.510 --> 11:55.577
Okay, no, it's weird when you do it.

11:58.090 --> 12:00.588
[sighs] All right, ladies, we're here.

12:00.590 --> 12:03.213
Finalist #2, please fetch
us beers from the keg.

12:03.215 --> 12:05.503
You will be graded on
speed and amount of foam.

12:05.505 --> 12:07.800
And if anyone asks who
you're here with, be vague.

12:07.802 --> 12:10.600
Okay. What's a keg?

12:10.602 --> 12:12.354
- Leila will show you.
- But drinking's a sin!

12:12.356 --> 12:14.776
You two have fun. Bye!

12:14.778 --> 12:16.376
You know I'm just going
through the motions, right?

12:16.378 --> 12:17.589
You've got this in the bag.

12:17.591 --> 12:20.459
Oh, my God, yay! My first friendternship.

12:20.461 --> 12:22.604
Leila came up with that silly term.

12:22.606 --> 12:24.487
It's really just a friendship.

12:26.665 --> 12:29.719
I wiped out on this epic
wave and fractured my spine.

12:29.721 --> 12:31.091
Almost killed me.

12:31.093 --> 12:32.481
I had to learn to walk again.

12:32.483 --> 12:33.833
That is intense.

12:33.835 --> 12:35.912
Yeah, it was. But you
know what it taught me?

12:35.914 --> 12:38.362
It taught me not to sweat the small stuff.

12:38.364 --> 12:40.300
It's all good.

12:44.319 --> 12:46.019
And that's my scar story.

12:46.021 --> 12:47.952
Who's next? Shane?

12:47.954 --> 12:50.905
Oh, well, clearly, all
my scars are emotional.

12:50.907 --> 12:53.568
But I'm still healing from our cliff jump.

12:53.570 --> 12:55.331
- Oh!
- Cliff jump?

12:55.333 --> 12:57.712
Dylan was feeling a
little homesick for Hawaii,

12:57.714 --> 13:00.580
so we took him to Lake Travis
so he could go cliff diving.

13:00.582 --> 13:02.727
But I made them all jump with me.

13:02.729 --> 13:05.110
[laughs] Let me guess.

13:05.112 --> 13:06.388
Karma barfed?

13:06.390 --> 13:08.706
Or... or had a panic attack?

13:08.708 --> 13:11.231
You didn't have to airlift her out, right?

13:11.233 --> 13:13.266
Because she's afraid of heights?

13:13.268 --> 13:14.834
When we were kids.

13:14.836 --> 13:17.117
I'll have you know I jumped twice!

13:17.119 --> 13:19.271
Yeah, but of course, this guy jumped first.

13:19.273 --> 13:21.407
Did a swan dive, made it look easy.

13:21.409 --> 13:24.095
Had it been raining recently?

13:24.097 --> 13:27.348
If the lake is high, then
it's not that big of a jump.

13:27.350 --> 13:29.077
Uh... anyway, back to my story.

13:29.079 --> 13:34.670
So, I step up to the edge and I look down.

13:34.672 --> 13:35.946
Oh, no.

13:35.948 --> 13:39.341
I tried that this summer and it
made me more paranoid than Fox News.

13:39.343 --> 13:40.464
Cool. Can you pass it to Starfish?

13:40.466 --> 13:43.330
No, pot brings up issues
from her home life.

13:43.332 --> 13:45.151
I forgot to cross my legs

13:45.153 --> 13:48.468
and got wracked so hard
in the nuts I passed out.

13:48.470 --> 13:50.170
Dylan had to swim out and save me.

13:50.172 --> 13:53.133
Unfortunately, he didn't
require mouth-to-mouth.

13:53.135 --> 13:54.547
both:
L-l-l-l-l-l!

13:54.549 --> 13:56.529
Reminds me of that time
you fell off the monkey bars

13:56.531 --> 13:58.407
and I had to carry you to the school nurse.

13:58.409 --> 14:00.335
- Yo, guys!
- all: Squid!

14:00.337 --> 14:01.810
My fellow guardians of life,

14:01.812 --> 14:03.871
I'm dedicating my newest piece to you.

14:03.873 --> 14:06.198
Every time I look at this,
I'm gonna remember your faces

14:06.200 --> 14:07.489
and this summer.

14:07.491 --> 14:08.531
I love you people.

14:08.533 --> 14:11.372
Hey, Squid, did you bring
enough ink to give us all one?

14:11.374 --> 14:12.269
Yeah, sure did.

14:12.271 --> 14:13.489
Meet me over at my tent.

14:13.491 --> 14:14.727
- Yay!
- Yes!

14:14.729 --> 14:16.037
- Do it!
- Wait, Karma.

14:16.039 --> 14:18.838
Karma, you made me promise I would stop you

14:18.840 --> 14:21.719
if you ever tried to get a tattoo.

14:21.721 --> 14:23.231
And you did.

14:23.233 --> 14:24.546
Thank you for your service.

14:24.548 --> 14:27.306
You are hereby honorably discharged!

14:28.780 --> 14:30.577
Karma's just doing what she always does...

14:30.579 --> 14:32.665
changing who she is to
fit in with the cool crowd.

14:32.667 --> 14:33.554
And that Dylan guy!

14:33.556 --> 14:35.375
That sappy surf story sounded so hokey.

14:35.377 --> 14:36.738
I bet he's not even really Hawaiian!

14:36.740 --> 14:38.991
And now she's in an altered
state and she's making decisions

14:38.993 --> 14:40.813
that are gonna have a
permanent impact on her body!

14:40.815 --> 14:43.524
And if he's lying about
this, what else is he hiding?

14:43.526 --> 14:45.224
together: I gotta do something.

14:45.226 --> 14:46.762
[instrument buzzing]

14:50.166 --> 14:55.202
I can't decide if I want it on
my shoulder blade or my neck.

14:55.204 --> 14:57.106
Let your heart decide.

14:58.975 --> 15:00.740
Summer's almost over.

15:00.742 --> 15:03.709
You sure you won't look
back with any regrets?

15:03.711 --> 15:07.113
Shane, we need to talk.

15:07.115 --> 15:08.781
Don't go too far.

15:08.783 --> 15:10.484
What do you really know
about this Dylan guy?

15:10.486 --> 15:12.023
His story is ridiculous!

15:12.025 --> 15:16.038
Liam, I am this close to finally
snorkeling with Swordfish over there.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.623
Look, I get it, you're jealous.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.305
I am not jealous! I'm cautious.

15:19.307 --> 15:21.495
Didn't Theo teach us
not to trust new people?

15:21.497 --> 15:22.896
May I join you brotados?

15:22.898 --> 15:24.564
Brotados! [laughs]

15:24.566 --> 15:26.371
Hey, I love that. Love that.

15:26.373 --> 15:28.837
Uh, do you say that in...
where are you from again?

15:28.839 --> 15:31.271
Paia, on the north side of Maui.

15:31.273 --> 15:34.207
Oh, that sounds... real.

15:34.209 --> 15:36.975
Sharkskin is fifth generation Hawaiian.

15:36.977 --> 15:37.916
How cool is that?

15:37.918 --> 15:40.011
Actually, I think he might
be the coolest person I know.

15:40.013 --> 15:41.419
Oh, I don't know about that.

15:41.421 --> 15:45.443
Dude, I've seen you stand barefoot
on hot cement for, like, an hour.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.800
Well, my people have walked
on fire for generations.

15:47.802 --> 15:50.440
Fine. Let's see you do it.

15:53.542 --> 15:57.164
Karma, you're up. Come on.

15:57.166 --> 15:59.422
- Oh!
- Oops.

15:59.424 --> 16:01.163
Is that what that did?

16:06.294 --> 16:08.145
It really feels like things are changing.

16:08.147 --> 16:11.861
Did you know the UN just declared
intersex rights are human rights?

16:11.863 --> 16:14.231
Uh-huh. Fascinating.

16:14.233 --> 16:16.400
There you are.

16:16.402 --> 16:18.720
Port-a-johns should be outlawed
in first world countries.

16:18.722 --> 16:19.951
I was going to tweet this pic of us,

16:19.953 --> 16:21.972
but I wanted to run it by you first.

16:21.974 --> 16:22.753
Approved! Ooh!

16:22.755 --> 16:24.142
Our skin tones are so compatible!

16:24.144 --> 16:25.517
Yay! I'll tag you.

16:25.519 --> 16:26.706
I'm sure your fans will love it.

16:26.708 --> 16:29.365
I know mine will!

16:29.367 --> 16:30.993
Your fans?

16:30.995 --> 16:32.880
Well, I only have 600 followers so far,

16:32.882 --> 16:35.235
but they're growing every day.

16:35.237 --> 16:36.774
We should do a collab.

16:36.776 --> 16:39.302
With my sense of humor and
your inspirational backstory,

16:39.304 --> 16:42.363
there's no way it wouldn't
be great for both our brands.

16:42.365 --> 16:44.274
What do you think?

16:44.276 --> 16:47.843
I think you're not here for
the right reasons, Erika.

16:47.845 --> 16:48.547
Yes, I am.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.303
I came hoping we could be friends.

16:50.305 --> 16:52.901
I have plenty of friends. Too many, really.

16:52.903 --> 16:56.372
What I need is a friendtern.

16:56.374 --> 16:57.585
[sighs] You.

16:57.587 --> 16:59.554
- What's your name?
- Bernadette.

16:59.556 --> 17:01.114
From now on, you're New Lisbeth.

17:01.116 --> 17:02.263
- Oh, my!
- I knew it!

17:02.265 --> 17:04.640
You so deserve this! You
have to stay over tonight.

17:04.642 --> 17:06.553
We'll order pizza, and I'll quiz you.

17:06.555 --> 17:09.625
I made flashcards of all of
Lauren's likes and dislikes.

17:14.263 --> 17:15.464
Dylan, you don't have to do this.

17:15.467 --> 17:16.888
You have nothing to prove.

17:16.891 --> 17:18.720
Well, I don't know if he
has nothing to prove...

17:18.722 --> 17:20.074
Shh. To do this,

17:20.076 --> 17:21.913
I have to get into a meditative state.

17:21.915 --> 17:23.550
Sure you do.

17:27.762 --> 17:30.444
[sizzling]

17:35.732 --> 17:38.088
[kids groaning, murmuring]

17:38.090 --> 17:40.175
Oh-oh-oh!
[laughs]

17:40.177 --> 17:41.582
[cheers and applause]

17:41.584 --> 17:42.365
- Did it!
- Oh, come on!

17:42.367 --> 17:43.361
That doesn't prove anything.

17:43.363 --> 17:44.495
These coals are not even that hot.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.102
Well, then you do it.

17:46.104 --> 17:47.611
Fine.

17:47.613 --> 17:49.015
I will.

17:51.432 --> 17:53.093
Let's do this.

17:53.095 --> 17:54.727
It wasn't enough for
you to crash the party,

17:54.729 --> 17:56.470
you just had to crash something else?

17:56.472 --> 17:58.269
Well, now I know why I wasn't invited.

17:58.271 --> 18:00.446
Because I know that you're
not someone who cliff-jumps

18:00.448 --> 18:02.468
and smokes pot and gets tattoos.

18:02.470 --> 18:05.671
You weren't invited because
tonight's not about you.

18:05.673 --> 18:08.133
And you have no right to tell me who I am.

18:08.135 --> 18:09.782
I know you better than anyone else.

18:09.784 --> 18:11.048
So let me get this straight.

18:11.050 --> 18:12.896
You get to change this summer, but I can't?

18:12.898 --> 18:14.103
No, you're twisting my words.

18:14.105 --> 18:15.542
If you wanted everything to stay the same,

18:15.544 --> 18:16.875
well, maybe you shouldn't have left.

18:16.877 --> 18:18.013
There it is.

18:18.015 --> 18:20.192
You finally admitted
that you're pissed at me!

18:20.194 --> 18:21.825
No more of this "it's all good"

18:21.827 --> 18:23.489
passive aggressive Malibu Barbie crap.

18:23.491 --> 18:25.296
Of course I'm pissed at you!

18:25.298 --> 18:27.264
You left me crying in
the middle of the street,

18:27.266 --> 18:28.096
you weren't gonna say good-bye,

18:28.098 --> 18:29.697
and now you don't even feel bad about it!

18:29.699 --> 18:32.799
I'm sorry you were hurt.
But I'm not sorry I left.

18:32.801 --> 18:35.108
That's the most [bleep]
non-apology I've ever heard.

18:35.110 --> 18:38.418
I'm not gonna apologize
for taking care of myself.

18:38.420 --> 18:39.372
And it's... it's not like

18:39.374 --> 18:43.649
you were sitting around
all summer crying, Starfish!

18:43.651 --> 18:45.316
[scoffs]

18:45.318 --> 18:48.414
Oh, there were tears. Oceans of them.

18:48.416 --> 18:50.350
I thought that they would never end.

18:50.352 --> 18:52.475
The only reason I got out
of bed was to come to work.

18:52.477 --> 18:54.722
These people were there for me, unlike you.

18:54.724 --> 18:56.602
Why are we even fighting about this?

18:56.604 --> 18:58.358
I left. It worked.

18:58.360 --> 19:00.401
I'm back, and I'm over you.
We should be celebrating.

19:00.403 --> 19:01.878
Not until you own what you did.

19:01.880 --> 19:05.836
I won't apologize for leaving.

19:05.838 --> 19:08.274
Starfish, you're next.

19:10.944 --> 19:13.109
Excuse me while I get a tattoo

19:13.111 --> 19:15.260
to commemorate my awesome summer.

19:15.262 --> 19:16.630
Karma.

19:17.858 --> 19:20.694
Ah, ah, ah! Turns out, he is Hawaiian.

19:28.264 --> 19:30.974
You, uh... You okay?

19:30.976 --> 19:33.336
I'm trained in first aid.
I could look at your feet.

19:33.338 --> 19:34.893
I'll be fine.

19:34.895 --> 19:36.367
It hurt less than my pride.

19:36.369 --> 19:38.466
[chuckles]

19:38.468 --> 19:40.356
Man, I can't believe I did that.

19:40.358 --> 19:43.061
Well, if you need proof, I have video.

19:44.881 --> 19:48.206
I always figured that Karma
would date someone new, but...

19:48.208 --> 19:49.559
when that guy was also friends with you,

19:49.561 --> 19:51.316
it was too much.

19:51.318 --> 19:53.530
My whole system crashed.

19:53.532 --> 19:56.557
Can we just not make it a big thing?

19:56.559 --> 20:00.413
Boo, way to take all the fun out of it.

20:00.415 --> 20:02.894
Man, it just feels like I'm being replaced.

20:02.896 --> 20:05.902
Liam, after you carried
me to the nurse's office,

20:05.904 --> 20:07.565
what did I tell you?

20:07.567 --> 20:09.939
- What did I tell you?
- That I was your best friend.

20:09.941 --> 20:12.336
Exactly. The best.

20:12.338 --> 20:15.307
Not one of the best.

20:15.309 --> 20:17.609
That's still true.

20:17.611 --> 20:19.544
That's good to hear.

20:19.546 --> 20:23.715
Maybe you could say it one
more time in front of Sharkskin?

20:23.717 --> 20:26.615
- I'll have to think about it.
- Please!

20:26.617 --> 20:28.096
Okay, here we go.

20:28.098 --> 20:29.698
Last chance to back out.

20:29.700 --> 20:32.783
Nope. Just do it, I'm ready.

20:32.785 --> 20:33.992
[instrument buzzing]

20:33.994 --> 20:35.688
This is gonna look sick.

20:35.690 --> 20:39.545
Starfish, you okay?

20:39.547 --> 20:41.133
It's all good.

20:52.279 --> 20:54.584
I really don't want to talk about Karma.

20:54.586 --> 20:58.103
