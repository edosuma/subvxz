00:03.337 --> 00:05.908
<i>You are being watched.</i>

00:06.073 --> 00:08.212
<i>The government has a secret system,</i>

00:08.375 --> 00:12.653
<i>a machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.</i>
<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:12.813 --> 00:16.761
<i>I designed The Machine to detect acts
of terror but it sees everything.</i>

00:16.917 --> 00:20.228
<i>Violent crimes
involving ordinary people.</i>

00:20.387 --> 00:25.166
<i>The government considers these
people irrelevant. We don't.</i>

00:25.325 --> 00:29.831
<i>Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.</i>

00:29.997 --> 00:31.601
<i>You'll never find us,</i>

00:31.765 --> 00:37.215
<i>but victim or perpetrator,
if your number's up, we'll find you.</i>

00:41.341 --> 00:43.719
<i>- 911. What is your emergency?
- I need you to calm down!</i>

00:43.877 --> 00:46.448
- 911. <i>What's your emergency?</i>
<i>- Shut up! Shut up!</i>

00:46.613 --> 00:49.653
<i>- 911. What's your emergency?
- 911. What's your emergency?</i>

00:49.750 --> 00:51.354
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

00:51.518 --> 00:53.589
<i>You gotta help me.
They've broken into my car.</i>

00:53.754 --> 00:54.874
Are you in the car now, sir?

00:54.922 --> 00:57.129
<i>No. Thank God.
I'm across the street.</i>

00:57.291 --> 00:59.331
Good. Please do not attempt
to approach the vehicle.

00:59.359 --> 01:00.439
Now do you see any weapons?

01:00.594 --> 01:02.834
<i>They're ripping up the interior!
They're everywhere!</i>

01:02.858 --> 01:05.800
All right, and are they attempting
to steal the vehicle?

01:05.966 --> 01:10.472
<i>What? Don't be ridiculous.
Squirrels can't drive.</i>

01:10.637 --> 01:13.777
I'm afraid squirrels
fall outside the purview of 911.

01:13.941 --> 01:16.717
Let me connect you
to a non-emergency operator.

01:16.877 --> 01:18.220
Good job, Harold.

01:18.378 --> 01:20.458
You sure you've never done
this kind of thing before?

01:20.482 --> 01:25.329
Not quite, although I do have some
applicable experience.

01:25.552 --> 01:26.758
<i>I don't know, Finch.</i>

01:26.920 --> 01:29.040
Maybe we should get Fusco
to question those squirrels.

01:29.064 --> 01:32.564
Reese is right. Could be a whole
rodent carjacking ring.

01:32.726 --> 01:34.262
Keeping entertained, are we?

01:34.428 --> 01:36.999
<i>I'd be happy to trade places,
Ms. Shaw.</i>

01:37.164 --> 01:40.008
I admit, I'm not sure
what makes me the best fit

01:40.167 --> 01:42.408
for this particular
undercover mission.

01:42.502 --> 01:45.312
At a desk, surrounded by monitors,
helping people in danger.

01:45.472 --> 01:47.315
All you're missing is the dog.

01:48.342 --> 01:51.186
Besides, would you really want
someone to call 911 and get me?

01:51.345 --> 01:52.653
Point taken.

01:52.813 --> 01:55.020
These calls represent the numbers
we never get.

01:55.182 --> 01:58.356
Crimes that unfold too quickly
for the Machine to detect.

01:58.518 --> 01:59.997
So, it's a win-win, Finch.

02:00.153 --> 02:02.759
You get to help them,
while looking into our latest number.

02:03.023 --> 02:05.469
Sandra Nicholson.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.798
<i>911 operator
and trainee supervisor.</i>

02:07.961 --> 02:11.875
She's got a stack of commendations.
So what's the threat?

02:12.032 --> 02:16.344
911 operators are often witnesses
at trial, targets of lawsuits,

02:16.503 --> 02:19.814
and now that I've hacked
the routing system,

02:19.973 --> 02:23.318
I can monitor every call she gets.

02:26.380 --> 02:29.224
Sandra? Her car went off a bridge
into the water.

02:29.383 --> 02:30.903
She's sinking.
I don't know what to do.

02:30.927 --> 02:34.229
Okay. Hello, ma'am, can you hear me?
What's your name?

02:34.388 --> 02:37.028
<i>Jackie. I'm trapped.
Oh, my God.</i>

02:37.190 --> 02:38.191
All right, Jackie, just relax.

02:38.358 --> 02:39.393
We're gonna get you out of there,
okay?

02:39.559 --> 02:41.999
<i>Cars can float for up to two minutes,
so we got a little time.</i>

02:42.129 --> 02:45.049
<i>The doors are stuck and the
windows have shorted out. Please help.</i>

02:45.073 --> 02:48.809
- Jackie, are you wearing heels?
- <i>Yes, these stupid four-inch pumps.</i>

02:48.969 --> 02:50.849
All right, those pumps
are gonna save your life.

02:50.904 --> 02:53.544
Your car window's weak spot
is up front near the door hinges.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.547
I want you to kick that spot
as hard as you can

02:55.571 --> 02:58.217
with your heel, okay?
Go!

03:01.548 --> 03:02.686
<i>It worked!</i>

03:02.849 --> 03:04.169
<i>Unit 1234 arriving on scene.</i>

03:04.251 --> 03:06.492
<i>We have eyes on the car.
We'll take it from here.</i>

03:06.653 --> 03:08.564
All right, Jackie.
Rescue team's on the way.

03:10.757 --> 03:12.168
She's good.

03:12.325 --> 03:13.845
At handling
other people's emergencies.

03:13.994 --> 03:17.339
<i>I wonder how she'll hold up
when she's faced with one of her own.</i>

Murder weapon on the Kipling case.

03:27.890 --> 03:30.211
What do you think, Fusco?
Right size, right shape?

03:30.377 --> 03:33.017
Wrong edge.
Wound was serrated, remember?

03:35.615 --> 03:36.855
Hey, Fusco, hold up a second.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.928
Suspect's guilty as hell,

03:39.086 --> 03:41.293
but we can't get his DNA
without a warrant.

03:41.455 --> 03:44.015
- The DA wants to kick him.
- Ever hear of dumpster diving, Kane?

03:45.292 --> 03:48.296
Excuse me. Det. Fusco?

03:48.462 --> 03:50.464
Jake Harrison.
Just transferred over from the 12th,

03:50.630 --> 03:52.405
and I caught this case.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.307
Tara Cooke, 29.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.778
Found by the East River
yesterday morning.

03:56.937 --> 04:00.282
Head bashed in, wallet stolen.
Mugging gone bad, right?

04:00.440 --> 04:02.080
Everyone said
you were the guy to talk to.

04:02.309 --> 04:05.082
Look, kid, they bumped you up
to Homicide Task Force for a reason.

04:05.083 --> 04:07.718
They don't all come
with instructions. Figure it out.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.121
You want something from me too?

04:09.145 --> 04:11.460
- Is this a bad time, Detective?
- It ain't good.

04:11.618 --> 04:13.655
My brain's being picked on everything

04:13.820 --> 04:15.460
from interrogation
to evidence collection.

04:15.484 --> 04:16.665
Hardly surprising.

04:16.822 --> 04:18.564
Your arrest of Officer Simmons
brought you

04:18.725 --> 04:21.797
no small amount of esteem.
Perhaps you should be flattered

04:21.962 --> 04:24.499
<i>that your peers
are soliciting your advice.</i>

04:24.664 --> 04:26.664
Speaking of which,
did you receive the name I sent?

04:26.688 --> 04:29.903
Yeah, it was, uh...
Sandra Nicholson.

04:30.070 --> 04:33.279
Yeah, I mean, other than a couple
of parking tickets, she's clean.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.147
But she did have
a sealed juvie record.

04:35.308 --> 04:37.788
<i>She must have gotten
into some kind of trouble as a kid.</i>

04:37.944 --> 04:41.016
I don't suppose you could take a peek
behind that seal.

04:41.181 --> 04:44.287
I'm sorry, pal. With the whole HR
takedown, hit the force pretty hard.

04:44.451 --> 04:47.022
The whole department's
under scrutiny.

04:47.254 --> 04:50.258
So, unless you got a court order,
I guess I'm gonna have to say "no."

04:50.357 --> 04:53.201
Understood.
I thank you for your time, Detective.

04:53.360 --> 04:56.364
And as for your newfound popularity,
you've earned it.

04:56.530 --> 04:57.941
Yeah.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.722
See these bruises?
<i>Livor mortis.</i>

05:12.879 --> 05:15.553
It happens when a body stays
in one place, okay?

05:15.715 --> 05:19.458
Tara was found on her right side.
These bruises are on the left.

05:19.619 --> 05:23.396
And look, Forensics found industrial
carpet fibers stuck in the wound.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.901
But she wasn't wrapped up
in any carpet.

05:26.059 --> 05:29.165
Body was moved.
This isn't a mugging at all.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.832
Let's get to work.
Show me what else you got.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.033
Uh, yeah.

05:46.847 --> 05:50.021
- 911. What's your emergency?
<i>- My name is Aaron.</i>

05:50.183 --> 05:52.254
<i>Some men are trying to break
into my apartment.</i>

05:52.419 --> 05:53.557
Hi, Aaron.
I'm Sandra.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.495
I'm gonna help you out, okay?
Are you alone?

05:55.655 --> 05:57.828
The sitter wasn't here
when I got home from school

05:57.991 --> 05:59.026
and Mom's at work.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.570
All right, I'm sending the police
right away.

06:01.728 --> 06:03.401
All units, 10-31 in progress.

06:03.563 --> 06:08.535
216 Bakersfield Way, Unit 4-E.
Code Three. Repeat, Code Three.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.909
Mr. Reese, Ms. Shaw,
he may not be our number, but...

06:11.071 --> 06:12.516
We got it, Finch.
We're on our way.

06:13.773 --> 06:15.413
Sandra, they're breaking
through the door.

06:15.437 --> 06:16.717
Is there any place you can hide?

06:17.711 --> 06:19.952
There's a crawlspace
behind the panel in my closet.

06:20.113 --> 06:21.558
Perfect.
Go there now.

06:33.193 --> 06:36.299
<i>- Okay, Sandra, I'm in.</i>
- Okay, you're doing great, Aaron.

06:36.429 --> 06:40.468
<i>Now I want you to stay super quiet,
not a sound.</i>

07:00.987 --> 07:03.831
Sandra? It worked.
They're leaving.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.778
- No!
- Aaron?

07:17.070 --> 07:20.574
No, no' no!
No!

07:20.607 --> 07:25.920
- Aaron, are you all right? Aaron!
- No! No!

07:27.647 --> 07:30.457
Sandra? The men want me
to tell you something.

07:31.751 --> 07:35.927
- What? What is it?
- Answer your phone.

07:37.490 --> 07:38.992
What?

07:45.198 --> 07:49.010
- Hello?
<i>- So nice to meet you, Sandra.</i>

07:49.169 --> 07:51.877
<i>I apologize for calling you
on your personal cell phone,</i>

07:52.038 --> 07:56.384
<i>but for what we're about to do together,
I need you mobile.</i>

07:56.543 --> 08:00.184
- And what are we about to do?
<i>- Anything I say.</i>

08:00.347 --> 08:03.055
<i>You see,
I've just taken this boy hostage,</i>

08:03.216 --> 08:05.890
<i>and unless you follow
my instructions precisely,</i>

08:06.052 --> 08:09.329
<i>little Aaron is going to die.</i>

08:19.399 --> 08:21.345
Who is this?
What's your name?

08:21.835 --> 08:22.835
<i>Really, Sandra?</i>

08:22.902 --> 08:26.213
<i>A boy's life is at stake
and you want proper introductions.</i>

08:26.373 --> 08:29.980
How do I know Aaron is even real?
That this kidnapping wasn't staged?

08:30.143 --> 08:32.145
<i>I'd be happy
to cut off Aaron's hand</i>

08:32.412 --> 08:36.417
<i>and dump it outside your apartment
at 3621, 17th Avenue.</i>

08:36.582 --> 08:38.062
<i>Take a look at your phone.</i>

08:40.520 --> 08:44.400
<i>Now tell me exactly which body part
you'd like him to lose first.</i>

08:44.557 --> 08:48.937
- No! I believe you.
- Good.

08:50.096 --> 08:52.042
<i>Now, for the ground rules.</i>

08:52.198 --> 08:56.578
<i>Alert anyone to the situation,
disobey any of my commands,</i>

08:56.736 --> 09:00.013
<i>attempt in any way
to disconnect this call,</i>

09:00.173 --> 09:01.914
<i>and Aaron dies.</i>

09:02.075 --> 09:04.851
- Sounds simple enough.
<i>- I'm glad you think so.</i>

09:05.011 --> 09:06.752
<i>Command number one:</i>

09:06.913 --> 09:11.225
<i>Call off the police you've dispatched
to Aaron's home. Now.</i>

09:16.890 --> 09:21.464
All units, disregard 10-31
at 216 Bakersfield Way.

09:21.628 --> 09:24.802
The call was a hoax.
Repeat, there is no emergency.

09:24.964 --> 09:27.638
<i>Copy that.
Sector Charlie cancelling response.</i>

09:27.801 --> 09:31.578
<i>Excellent, Sandra.
You're gonna do just fine.</i>

09:31.871 --> 09:34.647
<i>Finch, we 're entering Aaron's
apartment building. Any news?</i>

09:34.707 --> 09:35.907
Aaron's been abducted by a man

09:35.942 --> 09:38.650
who was able to hack into the
911 private branch exchange

09:38.812 --> 09:41.554
<i>and ensure that the boy's call
went directly to Sandra.</i>

09:41.714 --> 09:44.285
Any idea why he'd single her out?

09:44.451 --> 09:47.921
Could be a grudge.
One of Sandra's 911 calls gone bad.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.368
Doesn't explain the kid, though.

09:49.456 --> 09:51.993
Why would Sandra's number come up,
if Aaron's the one in danger?

09:52.158 --> 09:53.728
If the machine gave us
Sandra's number,

09:53.893 --> 09:56.305
her fate and Aaron's are entwined.

10:10.910 --> 10:14.448
- Finch, no sign of them or the kid.
- Try the webcam.

10:14.614 --> 10:19.120
<i>I used a remote administration toll
to access Aaron's computer.</i>

10:22.288 --> 10:23.358
There he is.

10:29.095 --> 10:31.041
Guys who took him were pros.

10:31.197 --> 10:34.303
They're not military.
No sweep and clear.

10:34.467 --> 10:41.043
Flashy chrome pistol.
And that ring, a Gothic cross.

10:41.207 --> 10:42.208
Templarios.

10:42.375 --> 10:45.185
<i>Express kidnappers
from a Mexican cartel.</i>

10:45.345 --> 10:46.847
Best at what they do.

10:47.013 --> 10:50.551
I've pinpointed the GPS signal
from the mystery caller's phone.

10:50.717 --> 10:52.628
It's in a car cruising
Upper Manhattan.

10:52.785 --> 10:54.230
I'm on it.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.663
I'll see if I can track down
the cartel.

11:00.560 --> 11:03.404
<i>Looks like your dead girl
worked at a private equity firm.</i>

11:03.563 --> 11:05.634
<i>Let's go check out her office.</i>

11:06.666 --> 11:08.703
We'll run the usual tests.
But first glance?

11:08.868 --> 11:11.712
Carpet fibers aren't a match.
Your girl wasn't killed in her office.

11:21.347 --> 11:24.385
Hey. Didn't Glasses give you
the message? My dance cards booked.

11:24.551 --> 11:26.497
I'm helping a rookie with a homicide.

11:26.653 --> 11:27.927
So unless
the world's coming to an end...

11:28.087 --> 11:30.089
For a ten-year-old boy it is,
unless we save him.

11:30.256 --> 11:32.099
Why didn't you say so?
What do you need?

11:32.258 --> 11:33.931
The Templarios.

11:34.093 --> 11:35.936
Any idea where they've been
hanging out lately?

11:36.095 --> 11:37.733
I can't say for sure.

11:37.897 --> 11:40.673
They used to frequent a bar
up in Bedford Park called El Cetrero.

11:40.833 --> 11:43.712
That's where I'd try.
Good luck.

11:47.907 --> 11:50.888
- And you are?
- Brent Holm.

11:51.044 --> 11:54.048
I worked side by side with Tara
for two years.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.414
I heard she was mugged.
Why are you checking her office?

11:57.550 --> 11:58.961
Just have to rule some things out.

11:59.118 --> 12:01.894
We'll provide the police
with whatever you need.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.899
- Did you know Tara as well?
- I should hope so. I hired her.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.731
Gina Kincaid, CFO.

12:06.893 --> 12:09.533
And this is my husband
and CEO, Ron Kincaid.

12:09.696 --> 12:10.731
Good to meet you both.

12:10.897 --> 12:13.468
Tara was one
of our top young executives.

12:13.633 --> 12:15.237
We intend to help in any way we can.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.312
You know
what would be really helpful?

12:17.470 --> 12:19.430
If you could get us a copy
of the security footage

12:19.454 --> 12:21.079
of Tara's last day at work.

12:33.152 --> 12:35.962
It's done.
I've labeled Aaron's call a prank.

12:36.122 --> 12:39.069
<i>Good. Now plug your headset
into your phone.</i>

12:39.225 --> 12:40.966
<i>Your hands need to be free.</i>

12:41.127 --> 12:42.162
To do what?

12:42.328 --> 12:44.239
<i>Shut down
the building's backup generator:</i>

12:45.498 --> 12:47.102
If the power goes out,

12:47.267 --> 12:50.646
that generator is the only thing
keeping this call center online.

12:50.803 --> 12:53.784
- Why shut it down?
<i>- Because I asked nicely.</i>

12:53.940 --> 12:55.681
<i>I can be more emphatic,</i>

12:55.942 --> 12:59.082
<i>but people tend to get hurt
when that happens.</i>

13:03.650 --> 13:05.095
<i>Good girl.</i>

13:05.251 --> 13:07.356
<i>And try not to look so nervous,
Sandra.</i>

13:07.520 --> 13:11.195
<i>If I can see your hands shaking,
everyone can.</i>

13:14.827 --> 13:17.865
<i>- How old would you say he was?
- Get them as fast as you can.</i>

13:18.031 --> 13:20.033
<i>Now how long ago
did you take the pills?</i>

13:21.834 --> 13:24.714
<i>- You have a fire extinguisher?
- What was the man wearing?</i>

13:24.738 --> 13:27.446
<i>All right. What's your location?
What's the apartment number?</i>

13:27.607 --> 13:29.553
<i>Then you need to get out
of there as quickly as possible...</i>

13:29.709 --> 13:30.749
<i>What color was his jacket?</i>

13:30.877 --> 13:32.550
<i>How long has your cat
been stuck in the AC duct?</i>

13:32.712 --> 13:34.555
<i>Do not attempt to save
any of your possessions, okay?</i>

13:34.781 --> 13:37.301
<i>- And have you had any alcohol...
- What about other passengers?</i>

13:37.432 --> 13:40.432
- Anyone hurt when the car hit you?
<i>- Did you see which way he ran...</i>

13:40.456 --> 13:44.110
Sandra, I just wanted
to thank you again for your help.

13:44.190 --> 13:46.830
- Are you all right?
- Fine. Thanks.

13:51.397 --> 13:55.311
Why would he send her
to shut down the backup generator?

13:55.401 --> 13:57.904
- Can I help you, Sandra?
- I'm such a klutz.

13:58.071 --> 14:00.745
I think I dropped an earring
back there this morning.

14:00.907 --> 14:03.046
Is there any way I could go in
and take a look?

14:05.244 --> 14:06.689
Just sign in.

14:15.822 --> 14:19.031
<i>Oh, Sandra, did you really think
I wouldn't see that?</i>

14:19.192 --> 14:21.365
<i>You must not care about Aaron at all.</i>

14:21.527 --> 14:24.565
<i>Just like you didn't care
about little Joseph 20 years ago.</i>

14:24.731 --> 14:26.210
Joseph.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.347
<i>With the right resources,
you can access anything,</i>

14:29.502 --> 14:31.846
<i>even sealed juvenile records.</i>

14:32.004 --> 14:36.578
<i>The question is, are you doomed
to make the same mistake twice?</i>

15:02.969 --> 15:06.917
<i>Creepy down here, isn't it?
All right.</i>

15:07.240 --> 15:10.813
<i>Find the backup generator switch
and shut it off.</i>

15:21.454 --> 15:23.661
<i>Nicely done, Sandra.</i>

15:23.823 --> 15:27.965
<i>Just one more task to perform.
Let's go to the server room.</i>

15:40.606 --> 15:43.610
<i>Now, have a seat and sign in.</i>

15:51.517 --> 15:55.260
<i>Now, pull up all the 911 calls</i>

15:55.421 --> 15:58.027
<i>that came in two days ago.</i>

16:01.461 --> 16:04.271
<i>Thirty thousand nine hundred
and eighteen emergencies.</i>

16:04.430 --> 16:07.502
<i>New York, New York.
It's a wonderful town.</i>

16:07.667 --> 16:10.807
<i>Okay, one more step
and Aaron is home free.</i>

16:10.970 --> 16:12.711
Tell me,
so we can get this over with.

16:12.872 --> 16:16.877
<i>I want you to delete them, Sandra.
All of them.</i>

16:17.043 --> 16:20.320
I can't. Those calls
are part of the public record.

16:20.480 --> 16:24.724
They're evidence, confessions,
dying words. I won't.

16:24.884 --> 16:28.161
<i>I've told you what I require.
Now, you have to choose.</i>

16:28.321 --> 16:32.701
<i>Save 30,000 phone calls
or the life of one boy.</i>

16:32.859 --> 16:35.635
Ms. Shaw, I do hope you're closing in
on our mystery caller

16:35.795 --> 16:37.900
<i>because he's proving
to be quite elusive.</i>

16:38.064 --> 16:40.977
There's no evidence that he's broken
into the camera feeds,

16:41.133 --> 16:43.977
yet he's somehow able
to watch Sandra's every move.

16:44.136 --> 16:47.743
Thanks to the GPS coordinates you
sent me, I've got eyes on his car.

16:47.907 --> 16:51.252
And in a minute,
I'll have eyes on him.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.169
<i>Ms. Shaw,
did you find the caller?</i>

17:10.762 --> 17:14.836
Finch, we have a problem.

17:15.001 --> 17:19.415
<i>This guy's not just a voice,
he's a ghost.</i>

17:27.280 --> 17:29.120
Finch, you wanna tell me
what I'm holding here?

17:29.144 --> 17:31.258
From the description,
it sounds like a phone relay.

17:31.417 --> 17:33.454
The caller's voice is carried
from one phone

17:33.619 --> 17:35.030
through the other
and on to Sandra.

17:35.187 --> 17:37.907
<i>His call could be originating from
anywhere in the city or the world.</i>

17:38.024 --> 17:40.224
Should I untape them?
Maybe then you can trace the call.

17:40.248 --> 17:41.400
No, Ms. Shaw, please.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.563
If we untether the phones,
the call will disconnect

17:43.729 --> 17:44.889
and Aaron may well be killed.

17:44.964 --> 17:46.966
<i>Were you able to glean anything
from the driver?</i>

17:47.433 --> 17:48.377
Some guy paid him 1,000 bucks

17:48.401 --> 17:51.143
to drive around all day, phones
in the back. He never got a name.

17:51.304 --> 17:52.806
If only I could determine

17:52.972 --> 17:56.112
how he's able to keep such
a close eye on Sandra.

17:57.476 --> 18:00.946
<i>- Ma'am, are you someplace safe?
- Did the dog try to bite you?</i>

18:01.113 --> 18:04.060
<i>- I understand.
- Is the door locked?</i>

18:04.216 --> 18:05.957
Of course.

18:06.118 --> 18:07.998
Ms. Shaw, I have a pressing matter
to attend to.

18:08.154 --> 18:10.964
<i>Can you get a description of the man
who paid the driver?</i>

18:12.992 --> 18:14.494
My pleasure.

18:14.660 --> 18:17.231
<i>Think of it as an exchange,
Sandra.</i>

18:17.396 --> 18:19.433
<i>You delete a day's worth of calls,</i>

18:19.599 --> 18:23.012
<i>and I send Aaron home.
Happy and intact.</i>

18:23.169 --> 18:26.082
What good could deleting them
possibly do anyone?

18:26.238 --> 18:27.842
<i>It's the simpler solution.</i>

18:28.007 --> 18:30.920
Then why not just do it yourself,
if you have all these resources?

18:31.110 --> 18:33.818
<i>You know as well as I do
that the terminal you're sitting at</i>

18:33.980 --> 18:35.220
<i>is the only way to access them,</i>

18:35.247 --> 18:37.989
<i>which means I need someone
on the inside, you.</i>

18:38.150 --> 18:40.187
<i>Now enough talk.</i>

18:40.353 --> 18:44.267
<i>What's it gonna be, Sandra,
the calls or the kid?</i>

18:45.358 --> 18:47.599
Don't turn around.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.263
I have remotely activated
the mute function on your cell phone,

18:50.429 --> 18:51.703
so he can't hear us.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.366
Whoever's doing this to you

18:53.532 --> 18:56.138
has mounted a tiny webcam
on your headset.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.342
That's how he can watch you,
no matter where you go.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.977
Harold.
How do you know about this?

19:01.140 --> 19:02.778
No time to explain.
You have to trust me.

19:02.942 --> 19:04.382
I have a team working to save Aaron,

19:04.477 --> 19:07.720
but we need to determine who's behind
all of this and what he wants.

19:07.880 --> 19:11.555
If deleting 30,000 calls
is the simpler solution,

19:11.717 --> 19:13.390
then that's likely just a smokescreen

19:13.552 --> 19:16.897
to hide the one call that our friend
is truly concerned about.

19:17.056 --> 19:19.969
If we could locate that call,

19:20.126 --> 19:21.806
we might be able
to turn the tables on him.

19:21.830 --> 19:23.901
<i>I'm losing patience, Sandra.</i>

19:25.631 --> 19:28.737
I can't just hit delete once.
I have to do it in batches.

19:28.901 --> 19:31.142
It could take 15 minutes
for an entire day,

19:31.237 --> 19:33.376
and to do that,
I need an elite admin code.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.478
Only the head of IT has it
on a key fob that...

19:36.642 --> 19:39.418
<i>Then stop wasting time,
and go get that code!</i>

19:41.580 --> 19:43.660
While you do that,
I'll stay here and find that call.

19:43.684 --> 19:48.030
And remember,
keep me out of your line of sight.

20:00.499 --> 20:03.605
I checked the security footage
from Tara Cooke's last day at work.

20:03.769 --> 20:05.840
Arrives in the morning
and leaves at night.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.780
Nothing unusual.

20:07.940 --> 20:09.851
Best I came up with was this,

20:10.009 --> 20:12.956
a map of places
Tara spent most of her time.

20:14.947 --> 20:18.861
Forensics got carpet fibers
from all these spots. No matches.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.793
What about that co-worker of hers,
"Mr. Concerned?"

20:21.954 --> 20:23.797
I'll check him out.

20:30.763 --> 20:33.083
Hey. Wonder Boy tells me
you guys are trying to help a kid.

20:33.132 --> 20:35.203
Indeed, Detective,
which is why I need your help.

20:35.367 --> 20:36.887
I'm looking for a needle
in a haystack.

20:36.911 --> 20:40.646
<i>One suspicious 911
cal! out of 30,000.</i>

20:40.806 --> 20:41.944
Thirty thousand?

20:42.108 --> 20:43.988
That's not a haystack,
that's a whole damn farm.

20:44.043 --> 20:46.455
Using probabilities,
I was able to reduce that number.

20:46.612 --> 20:49.786
For instance, 38 percent of all calls
to the 911 system

20:49.949 --> 20:53.158
are the result of unintended pressure
to the keypad.

20:53.319 --> 20:54.919
Wait a minute.
You're telling me that 911

20:54.954 --> 20:56.797
gets over 11,000 butt dials a day?

20:56.956 --> 21:00.301
I'm afraid so, but it did allow me
to weed out almost half of the calls.

21:00.459 --> 21:03.303
I also removed purse-snatchings,
stalled cars...

21:03.462 --> 21:05.662
Let's cut to the chase.
How many calls we gonna look at?

21:05.686 --> 21:08.343
Three hundred and twelve
in the next five minutes.

21:08.501 --> 21:10.811
<i>I'm sending you
your half of the list.</i>

21:10.970 --> 21:12.972
The attachment contains audio files,

21:13.139 --> 21:15.779
along with each phone's number,
call history

21:15.941 --> 21:17.750
and the map of its location data.

21:17.910 --> 21:20.015
A hundred and fifty six calls
in five minutes?

21:20.179 --> 21:21.920
Happy hunting, Detective.

21:22.081 --> 21:24.823
<i>No, it's gotta be version 10.6, okay?</i>

21:28.154 --> 21:31.465
No, I told you. If the protocols
don't match, the router won't work.

21:31.624 --> 21:34.195
Well, try again.

21:35.861 --> 21:37.204
Hey, Todd, you got a minute?

21:37.363 --> 21:39.483
One of my trainees yanked too hard
on a monitor cable,

21:39.507 --> 21:42.145
tore the connector right off.
You have a spare?

21:42.334 --> 21:44.041
When will they learn
to respect the tech?

21:44.203 --> 21:46.274
Keep an eye on that one.

21:46.438 --> 21:48.213
<i>Now get that key fob.</i>

21:52.178 --> 21:54.715
<i>Better hurry
or you're gonna get caught.</i>

22:00.820 --> 22:04.791
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

22:04.957 --> 22:05.958
Hey.

22:10.462 --> 22:14.410
- You okay, Sandra?
- Rough call.

22:20.406 --> 22:21.926
<i>Time is running out, Detective.</i>

22:22.007 --> 22:24.078
<i>Let me know
if you find that 911 call.</i>

22:24.243 --> 22:29.056
<i>He's stealing from me every day!
It's my newspaper!</i>

22:30.416 --> 22:32.225
<i>Breaking
everything in the house.</i>

22:32.384 --> 22:35.888
<i>This is how it gets whenever
the Knicks lose and I've had it.</i>

22:37.256 --> 22:40.999
<i>- 911. What's your emergency?
- It's my fault. I was wrong.</i>

22:41.160 --> 22:44.767
<i>I shouldn't have slept with him.
Now, he hurt me.</i>

22:44.930 --> 22:46.090
<i>Honey, where are you?</i>

22:46.114 --> 22:48.103
<i>I see your phone moving west
on Highway 25.</i>

22:48.400 --> 22:49.902
<i>We were driving.</i>

22:50.102 --> 22:54.278
<i>I said I was leaving him.
He hurt me.</i>

22:54.440 --> 22:56.040
<i>Okay, I've got police
coming to find you.</i>

22:56.064 --> 22:57.064
<i>Just stay with me.</i>

22:57.109 --> 22:59.453
<i>You're on a prepaid cell,
so I can't see your name.</i>

22:59.612 --> 23:01.285
<i>Wanna tell me your name?</i>

23:01.447 --> 23:06.294
<i>Hello? Are you there?
Answer me. Please answer me.</i>

23:06.452 --> 23:07.726
Wait a minute.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.191
This caller's phone has been
in the same locations

23:10.356 --> 23:11.960
as the rookie's homicide victim.

23:13.692 --> 23:14.727
Tara.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.312
<i>Hey, Glasses,
I think I found the call.</i>

23:23.469 --> 23:25.269
And if I'm right,
we're working the same case.

23:25.371 --> 23:28.113
Homicide victim.
She called from a burner phone.

23:28.274 --> 23:30.194
Battery went dead
before police could locate her.

23:30.309 --> 23:33.620
But I'm pretty sure I know her name.
I'm sending you the info now.

23:39.385 --> 23:41.160
- Tara Cooke.
- Yeah.

23:41.320 --> 23:42.993
I'm betting whoever's threatening
that kid

23:43.155 --> 23:44.657
is the same person who killed Tara.

23:44.823 --> 23:47.633
<i>Now, is there any way
you can access Tara's voice mail?</i>

23:47.793 --> 23:49.329
I'll try, Detective.

23:52.398 --> 23:55.845
<i>Who is that?
Who is helping you?</i>

23:56.001 --> 23:58.413
Nobody.
I swear I don't know that person.

23:58.570 --> 24:01.517
<i>I'm not a fan of lies, Sandra.
You broke one of my rules.</i>

24:01.674 --> 24:02.675
Please don't hurt Aaron.

24:02.841 --> 24:04.320
<i>You should've thought of Aaron</i>

24:04.476 --> 24:06.854
<i>before you involved someone else
in our arrangement.</i>

24:07.012 --> 24:10.789
<i>Now I have no choice.
I'm a man of my word.</i>

24:10.950 --> 24:13.692
<i>Just remember.
This was your fault.</i>

24:21.193 --> 24:22.968
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

24:23.128 --> 24:24.368
<i>Would you like me to send
an ambulance to your...</i>

24:24.530 --> 24:25.873
An explosion.
Are you sure?

24:26.031 --> 24:27.631
Where was the bomb
when it went off, sir?

24:27.655 --> 24:30.033
<i>Are you all right?
Is anyone injured?</i>

24:30.369 --> 24:33.179
How many windows
were shattered from the explosion?

24:33.839 --> 24:36.513
<i>And as far as you can tell,
was anyone injured?</i>

24:36.675 --> 24:38.985
Is he dead?
Did you kill Aaron?

24:39.144 --> 24:41.283
<i>The bomb I exploded
was in a parking garage.</i>

24:41.447 --> 24:44.223
<i>Three cars were turned
into flaming metal husks.</i>

24:44.383 --> 24:46.886
<i>Call it a warning shot.</i>

24:47.052 --> 24:50.056
<i>Aaron is still alive.
For the moment.</i>

24:50.222 --> 24:53.726
<i>- Okay, I understand.
- No, I don't think you do.</i>

24:53.892 --> 24:56.236
<i>You see,
a bomb of the exact same size</i>

24:56.395 --> 24:58.705
<i>is currently strapped
to little Aaron.</i>

24:58.864 --> 25:02.402
<i>And since my rules have proven
too complicated for you to follow,</i>

25:02.568 --> 25:05.071
<i>I'm gonna make this all very simple.</i>

25:05.237 --> 25:07.581
<i>You have exactly 15 minutes
lo delete those calls</i>

25:07.740 --> 25:12.155
<i>before I set that bomb off,
starting now.</i>

25:13.912 --> 25:15.255
<i>Do it!</i>

25:15.414 --> 25:17.655
<i>Or the next dispatch call you make</i>

25:17.816 --> 25:19.496
<i>will be to have officers
pick up the pieces</i>

25:19.585 --> 25:21.587
<i>of what's left of that boy's body.</i>

25:21.754 --> 25:23.734
<i>Do you understand me now,
Sandra?</i>

25:49.681 --> 25:52.025
At first, it didn't make sense.

25:52.184 --> 25:54.562
Of all the operators out there
on that floor,

25:54.720 --> 25:57.291
why pick the one who is least likely
to crack under pressure

25:57.456 --> 25:59.436
and give in to his demands?

25:59.591 --> 26:05.303
A foolish move,
unless he knew something about you.

26:05.464 --> 26:07.774
Something in a sealed juvenile record
that he could twist

26:07.933 --> 26:12.109
into the perfect leverage
to get you to do what he was asking.

26:12.271 --> 26:15.480
The loss of a child.

26:21.113 --> 26:23.457
His name was Joseph.

26:23.615 --> 26:27.461
He was three years old, and he had a
smile that just made everything okay.

26:27.619 --> 26:31.465
I lived across the street,
used to babysit him all the time.

26:32.658 --> 26:36.731
And one night, when I was 14,
I was giving him a bath.

26:36.895 --> 26:40.809
He wanted a toy.
Ridiculous yellow frog.

26:41.967 --> 26:45.779
It was just downstairs.
I was only gone a minute.

26:48.006 --> 26:50.350
You can probably guess the rest.

26:52.444 --> 26:56.517
The worst part wasn't desperately
trying to perform CPR

26:56.682 --> 26:57.882
before the paramedics arrived.

26:59.318 --> 27:03.528
Or even when the police charged me
with negligent homicide.

27:03.689 --> 27:07.034
No, the worst part
was when I came back upstairs

27:07.192 --> 27:10.537
and I found him lying face down
in the tub.

27:11.330 --> 27:17.212
I froze. I couldn't think.
I couldn't move.

27:18.871 --> 27:21.784
And to this day, I wonder
whether those extra 15 seconds

27:21.940 --> 27:24.045
wouldn't have saved Joseph's life.

27:24.209 --> 27:28.851
You were just a child yourself.
Anyone in those circumstances.

27:29.014 --> 27:31.893
That's what my lawyer said.

27:32.050 --> 27:36.226
And in the eyes of the law,
I was found innocent.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.230
But not in my eyes, Harold...

27:41.360 --> 27:43.499
...which is why I'm gonna do
whatever this man wants.

27:43.662 --> 27:44.697
Sandra, wait.

27:44.863 --> 27:47.400
There's a second reason
why the caller is targeting you.

27:47.566 --> 27:50.069
A 911 call you took two days ago.
A murder.

27:50.235 --> 27:54.411
I don't care. I'm not giving up
on another little boy.

27:54.573 --> 27:56.484
I'll give you as many minutes
as I can

27:56.642 --> 27:58.417
and then,
I'm deleting those calls.

27:58.577 --> 28:01.148
I'm turning around now.
Please get out of my way.

28:02.581 --> 28:05.152
I understand you won't give up
on Aaron.

28:05.817 --> 28:07.160
I won't give up on you.

28:12.591 --> 28:15.765
Ms. Shaw, if you still have those
tethered phones, hold on to them.

28:15.928 --> 28:18.602
<i>I have work to do.</i>

28:22.401 --> 28:25.712
Got a description.
Might be the guy we're looking for.

28:25.871 --> 28:27.612
<i>All right, Shaw, let's hear it.</i>

28:27.773 --> 28:29.252
Latino in a slick suit.

28:29.408 --> 28:31.684
<i>Ridiculous number of piercings
in his right ear,</i>

28:31.843 --> 28:33.720
<i>including a Gothic cross.</i>

28:33.879 --> 28:38.521
Templario.
Why am I not surprised?

28:45.591 --> 28:49.698
There he is.
Five does seem a bit ridiculous.

28:49.861 --> 28:52.137
I'm on my way.
No need to handle this on your own.

28:52.297 --> 28:54.971
Never been one to wait for backup.

28:57.102 --> 29:00.106
Just want a quick conversation
with him.

29:00.772 --> 29:05.221
And the rest of you can leave.
Nobody gets hurt.

29:12.317 --> 29:15.457
"Nobody gets hunt?"
How about you, <i>pendejo?</i>

29:15.621 --> 29:18.625
I was kind of hoping
you'd pick the hard way.

29:23.128 --> 29:25.208
<i>Hey, Glasses,
got some interesting information</i>

29:25.497 --> 29:28.501
<i>about my homicide victim
and her bosses, the Kincaids.</i>

29:28.667 --> 29:31.580
<i>Might help you with your kid.
Call you when I'm done.</i>

29:31.737 --> 29:35.583
I just got one other question.
Any idea what Tara has in her hand?

29:37.909 --> 29:40.753
- That's her cell phone.
- Uh-uh.

29:40.912 --> 29:44.086
That's her cell phone.
Found in her apartment.

29:45.684 --> 29:48.096
That is a burner phone.

29:48.186 --> 29:49.824
Tara had it on her
the night she died,

29:49.988 --> 29:52.366
but can't seem to find it
in any of her things.

29:52.524 --> 29:56.097
Turns out somebody got rid of it.
Somebody who killed her.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.402
We accessed the phone records.

29:58.430 --> 30:01.434
Tara used that burner phone
to only call two numbers:

30:01.600 --> 30:07.278
911 the night she died and this one.
Recognize it?

30:10.208 --> 30:11.983
No, me neither.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.944
That's why we decided
to check its voice mail.

30:14.046 --> 30:16.549
I know, how do you do that
without the code, right?

30:16.715 --> 30:19.595
I got this friend of mine who's just...
He's great at that type of thing.

30:21.386 --> 30:22.956
<i>Ron, it's Tara.</i>

30:23.121 --> 30:26.898
<i>I can't do this anymore,
the sneaking around.</i>

30:27.059 --> 30:31.371
<i>It's not fair to me or to Gina.
I wanna tell the world about us.</i>

30:31.530 --> 30:34.067
Even deleted voice mails
can be retrieved for up to 30 days.

30:34.232 --> 30:36.212
Ones and zeros,
they never really go away.

30:36.368 --> 30:40.248
- None of this is admissible in court.
- But this is.

30:41.006 --> 30:43.816
Carpet fibers from the mat
in your trunk,

30:43.975 --> 30:47.650
which is where Ron stuffed the body
after he hid her,

30:47.813 --> 30:49.417
before he dumped her
down by the river.

30:49.581 --> 30:51.181
But the real scare came
when you realized

30:51.249 --> 30:53.525
she made a 911 call.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.165
You didn't know
what was on that call,

30:55.189 --> 30:57.362
but you knew
you needed to get rid of it.

30:57.489 --> 31:00.197
See, normally, I'd let you squirm
and deny it.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.319
But you had to kidnap a little boy
to cover it up.

31:02.343 --> 31:03.437
Little boy.
What?

31:03.595 --> 31:04.596
Now you're gonna get on that phone,

31:04.763 --> 31:05.764
and you're gonna tell them
to let him go.

31:05.931 --> 31:08.343
Wait. He was just supposed
to get rid of the call.

31:08.500 --> 31:12.346
- He never said anything about...
- Who? Who'd you hire?

31:13.939 --> 31:17.352
I don't know.
Ron told me what he'd done.

31:17.509 --> 31:19.429
I found someone
who could get rid of the problem.

31:19.453 --> 31:23.799
- How do you call it off?
- I never asked.

31:44.202 --> 31:48.207
Don't worry, Shaw.
I saved the best for last.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.718
Are you him?

31:52.878 --> 31:54.880
The guy who's been terrorizing
a 911 operator

31:55.046 --> 31:57.151
and threatening to blow up a kid?

32:00.085 --> 32:03.259
You'll never catch him.
The guy is careful.

32:03.422 --> 32:06.130
Untraceable calls,
self-deleting texts.

32:06.291 --> 32:08.635
We do what he asks,
the money shows up in an account.

32:08.794 --> 32:10.354
Yeah,
I'm gonna make this simple.

32:10.514 --> 32:12.619
You're gonna tell us
where you're holding the boy.

32:12.850 --> 32:15.773
No way.

32:15.901 --> 32:19.007
You're going to have to shoot me.

32:20.439 --> 32:24.353
That won't be necessary.

32:36.822 --> 32:38.102
Mr. Reese, Ms. Shaw,
I have news.

32:38.190 --> 32:41.194
I was able to hack into the one
cellphone tower relaying signals

32:41.359 --> 32:43.669
from both of the tethered phones
Ms. Shaw found.

32:43.829 --> 32:45.672
I know where our mystery man
is calling from.

32:45.831 --> 32:47.951
Chances are it's the same place
they're holding Aaron.

32:47.975 --> 32:51.878
- An office tower <i>in</i> midtown.
- Already there, Finch.

32:52.037 --> 32:54.643
The Templario gave up
Aaron's location?

32:54.806 --> 32:56.086
We managed to pry it out of him.

32:57.342 --> 32:58.343
<i>Please be careful.</i>

32:58.510 --> 33:00.910
The man we're looking for
is highly intelligent, resourceful,

33:01.046 --> 33:02.957
and, no doubt,
dangerous when cornered.

33:03.114 --> 33:06.527
So basically, Finch, he's you.
If you were evil.

33:07.652 --> 33:09.563
I hardly welcome the comparison,
Ms. Shaw.

33:09.721 --> 33:12.725
<i>Please hurry. This man kidnapped
a child lo help a killer.</i>

33:12.891 --> 33:16.031
<i>And he'll succeed
if Sandra deletes those calls.</i>

33:16.194 --> 33:18.333
What, you need a new suit?

33:47.926 --> 33:48.926
Stop.

33:49.928 --> 33:52.528
<i>I've just been informed that the
clients who hired me for this job</i>

33:52.664 --> 33:54.007
<i>have confessed to the police.</i>

33:54.165 --> 33:57.271
<i>As such, my contract with them
is now null and void.</i>

33:58.603 --> 34:02.847
<i>Your services in this matter
are no longer required, Sandra.</i>

34:03.008 --> 34:05.386
So it's over.
You're letting Aaron go.

34:05.544 --> 34:08.956
<i>Regretfully, that has now
become impossible.</i>

34:09.114 --> 34:11.458
<i>I simply cannot risk any details
of this operation</i>

34:11.616 --> 34:15.792
<i>falling into police hands.
Cleanliness is all.</i>

34:21.560 --> 34:25.632
<i>Don't blame yourself.
You did everything you could.</i>

34:27.766 --> 34:30.406
- Don't do this, I'm begging you...
- I'm sorry, Sandra.

34:30.569 --> 34:33.982
<i>It's too late for Aaron,
and for you as well.</i>

34:34.139 --> 34:37.313
<i>Though, of course, eliminating you
was always part of the plan.</i>

34:41.646 --> 34:44.889
<i>It was a genuine pleasure
speaking with you, Sandra.</i>

34:45.050 --> 34:46.552
<i>Goodbye.</i>

34:59.431 --> 35:01.570
Sandra.

35:03.501 --> 35:04.673
Don't.

35:04.803 --> 35:05.907
It's protocol.

35:06.071 --> 35:07.812
During a blackout, we're all supposed
to exit through the front.

35:07.973 --> 35:10.533
Which is exactly what the man
who called you will be waiting for.

35:10.642 --> 35:15.648
- Is there another way out?
- Follow me.

35:20.919 --> 35:23.525
<i>Vamonos.</i> Let's go.

35:32.697 --> 35:35.303
What the hell?
I thought the elevator was locked.

35:50.215 --> 35:54.994
- We gotta defuse that bomb.
- Hey. There is no "dead" in "team."

35:55.153 --> 35:56.993
So, instead of going all
Charles Bronson on me,

35:57.017 --> 35:59.361
let me clear the way.

36:19.577 --> 36:22.922
You're Aaron, right?
I'm here to help.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.927
There's an exit down there.

36:32.390 --> 36:34.927
Sandra!

36:49.874 --> 36:53.720
A level switch.
Hold very still.

36:53.878 --> 36:57.690
Hey, Aaron.
You like baseball, right?

36:57.849 --> 36:59.624
Yeah, but I'm not a very good hitter.

36:59.784 --> 37:04.893
I used to have the same problem.
You know what helped?

37:05.056 --> 37:07.468
Every night, I'd close my eyes.

37:07.625 --> 37:12.597
Imagine myself hitting one
out of the park.

37:12.764 --> 37:16.974
I realized it was all about timing.

37:17.135 --> 37:20.776
Wanna give it a try?
Go ahead.

37:36.654 --> 37:40.500
- See that pitch coming, Aaron?
- Yeah.

37:40.658 --> 37:45.607
Swing as hard as you can.
Now.

37:45.764 --> 37:49.473
- I did it.
- Yeah, you did.

37:49.634 --> 37:51.807
Got the last kidnapper.

37:54.172 --> 37:56.015
You figure out which one
was behind all this?

37:56.174 --> 37:59.678
Yeah.
None of them.

37:59.911 --> 38:02.016
Then, he's still out there.

38:30.975 --> 38:32.215
Don't move.

38:35.547 --> 38:37.458
Before you make a grave error
of judgment,

38:37.615 --> 38:39.959
permit me to describe
what I have in my hand.

38:40.118 --> 38:43.361
It's a severed electrical cable
connected to this generator.

38:43.521 --> 38:44.898
Current is running through it

38:45.056 --> 38:48.833
at ten times the amperage required
for electrocution.

38:48.993 --> 38:50.995
All I have to do is drop it
in that water,

38:51.162 --> 38:55.406
and within three seconds, the muscles
in your heart will fibrillate.

38:55.567 --> 38:58.912
Now, I'm not a violent man.

38:59.070 --> 39:02.244
But not only have you tried
to harm this young woman

39:02.407 --> 39:03.886
and an innocent child,

39:04.042 --> 39:06.852
you have shut down a 911 call center

39:07.011 --> 39:09.924
in one of the more dangerous cities
in the country.

39:10.081 --> 39:11.321
So now, there are two things

39:11.482 --> 39:15.430
that will keep me
from ending your life right now.

39:15.753 --> 39:18.700
First, I want you to drop the gun.

39:27.232 --> 39:30.111
Second, I need to hear the sound
of your voice.

39:31.369 --> 39:36.114
Please. I just work for the guy.
I don't even know his name.

39:36.274 --> 39:38.845
Sandra, get his weapon.

39:59.230 --> 40:02.439
Hey. Just wanted to say thanks again
for all your help.

40:02.600 --> 40:04.375
The Kincaids have lawyered up.

40:04.535 --> 40:07.106
But the carpet fibers in Ron's trunk

40:07.272 --> 40:09.115
are a match for the ones found
on Tara's body.

40:09.274 --> 40:11.481
So, between that
and the phone records,

40:11.643 --> 40:14.624
it shouldn't be too hard
to get a conviction.

40:14.779 --> 40:18.124
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, you too.

40:19.317 --> 40:21.456
I'd say we make a pretty good team,
don't you think?

40:22.720 --> 40:24.256
We ain't a team.

40:30.094 --> 40:32.074
What, are you gonna stand there
all day?

40:32.230 --> 40:34.437
Get yourself a cup of coffee
and get back to work.

40:34.599 --> 40:37.011
I can't help you solve
all your cases.

40:46.911 --> 40:48.356
- Sandra.
- Harold.

40:49.781 --> 40:51.192
So glad you could meet.

40:51.349 --> 40:54.125
I was on my way to work.
It's the least I could do.

40:54.285 --> 40:57.129
- I owe you my life.
- I was happy to lend a hand.

40:57.288 --> 40:59.928
To tell you the truth, I've come
to think of <i>us as</i> kindred spirits,

40:59.952 --> 41:03.964
taking emergency calls
to help those who need us.

41:04.128 --> 41:06.836
So, is that how you found me?
You got a call?

41:06.998 --> 41:09.274
Something like that.

41:09.434 --> 41:10.674
What I mean to say is,

41:10.835 --> 41:13.179
it does my heart good to know
that you're out there.

41:13.338 --> 41:16.876
Likewise, Harold.
I should get to work.

41:17.041 --> 41:21.319
Before you leave, there was something
I'd like to show you.

41:24.182 --> 41:27.322
- Nice hit, Aaron.
- Is that him?

41:27.485 --> 41:31.661
I wanted to offer you the one thing
that 911 operators never get.

41:32.056 --> 41:33.057
Closure.

41:51.843 --> 41:53.754
Aaron looks happy.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.185
You'd never guess
what he'd been through.

41:56.347 --> 41:58.156
Kids are resilient creatures.

41:58.316 --> 42:00.557
As are adults,
if they have the right friends.

42:00.718 --> 42:04.757
My deepest thanks to both of you
for a job well done.

42:05.256 --> 42:06.735
Well, not quite done.

42:06.891 --> 42:12.534
If you still wanna find the guy,
maybe these could help.

42:22.673 --> 42:24.846
- Hello?
- Finally.

42:25.009 --> 42:28.582
<i>A chance to speak to the man
who handed me my first defeat.</i>

42:28.746 --> 42:30.089
I didn't do it alone.

42:30.248 --> 42:32.785
<i>Oh, believe me, I'm quite aware.</i>

42:32.950 --> 42:34.122
I'm warning you now,

42:34.285 --> 42:36.788
any attempt to harm
either Sandra or Aaron again

42:36.954 --> 42:38.126
would be a mistake.

42:38.289 --> 42:39.461
<i>No need to worry.</i>

42:39.624 --> 42:41.544
<i>Sandra's earned her life
as far as I'm concerned.</i>

42:41.692 --> 42:45.902
<i>And at this point, harming Aaron
would be counter-productive.</i>

42:47.532 --> 42:51.776
<i>You, however,
are another story entirety.</i>

42:52.103 --> 42:53.582
<i>I'll be seeing you.</i>

42:55.640 --> 42:57.586
What did he say?

43:01.312 --> 43:04.316
Nothing of any consequence.
