00:02.152 --> 00:04.061
Claire:<i>  To never having to</i>
<i>  work with dumb-ass tech bros</i>
<i>  ever again.</i>

00:04.063 --> 00:05.487
Evan:<i>  What about us?</i>

00:05.565 --> 00:06.897
I really want you
to kiss me right now.

00:06.899 --> 00:08.156
But no one can know.

00:08.234 --> 00:09.734
Claire:
<i>  There's this tech incubator</i>

00:09.736 --> 00:10.676
<i>  that does open pitch events</i>
<i>  twice a year.</i>

00:10.753 --> 00:12.178
They have one
coming up in two weeks.

00:12.255 --> 00:15.014
We're really excited
about this idea.
What do you think?

00:15.091 --> 00:16.331
I think
it's a bad idea.

00:16.409 --> 00:19.001
Start with
something small,
like a game app.

00:19.078 --> 00:21.503
Maybe we start simpler?
Like a game app.

00:21.581 --> 00:22.747
You're pressing charges
against Jerod?

00:22.749 --> 00:24.248
Is this you
getting back at me?

00:24.250 --> 00:25.674
Callie,
if that was the case,

00:25.752 --> 00:27.026
I could just press charges
against you

00:27.103 --> 00:28.602
for stealing
privileged documents
from my briefcase.

00:28.679 --> 00:30.012
Callie:<i>  Did you</i>
<i>  really quit your job?</i>

00:30.089 --> 00:32.273
Jamie:<i>  Pretty much forced</i>
<i>  to negotiate my exit.</i>

00:32.349 --> 00:34.033
The truth is you always felt

00:34.110 --> 00:34.683
like you were
compromising yourself
to be with me.

00:34.761 --> 00:35.593
This was a mistake.

00:35.595 --> 00:36.852
It should
never have happened.

00:36.871 --> 00:39.538
Jerod:<i>  I just need to know</i>
<i>  when I can go home.</i>

00:39.615 --> 00:40.931
What does
the big lawyer say?

00:40.933 --> 00:42.600
What is your real best offer?

00:42.602 --> 00:44.101
Three months,
plus time served.

00:44.103 --> 00:46.712
Thank you, Marc.
But we're gonna take
this one to trial.

00:46.789 --> 00:48.196
We have the potential
for a lawsuit.

00:48.274 --> 00:51.366
Shouldn't we at least take
the 30-day deal to Jerod?

00:51.444 --> 00:53.201
No. Absolutely not.

00:53.279 --> 00:54.870
Malika:
<i>  Her name's Yvonne Byers.</i>

00:54.947 --> 00:56.389
And they keep changing
her dates to appear
at the last minute

00:56.465 --> 00:58.799
until she's missed them
because she doesn't have
childcare.

00:58.876 --> 01:00.876
Is there any way
you can help her?

01:00.953 --> 01:01.452
I need to tell you something.

01:01.454 --> 01:02.953
I love you.

01:02.955 --> 01:04.212
Gael:
<i>  Hey, have you seen Dennis?</i>

01:04.290 --> 01:05.472
Dennis:<i>  I can't come back</i>
<i>  to the Coterie.</i>

01:05.549 --> 01:09.126
I think I've been trying
to find a way out of this,

01:09.128 --> 01:10.644
<i>  when I need to find</i>
<i>  a way through it.</i>

01:10.721 --> 01:12.129
We should get a drink.

01:12.131 --> 01:13.464
Davia:<i>  I'm kind of</i>
<i>  seeing someone.</i>

01:13.466 --> 01:15.074
Dyonte:
<i>  This is Capoeira.</i>

01:15.151 --> 01:16.892
<i>  I wanted to share this</i>
<i>  with you before court today</i>

01:16.969 --> 01:18.727
<i>  because this practice</i>
<i>  helps me feel strong</i>
<i>  and resilient.</i>

01:18.805 --> 01:20.029
It's okay.
I got this.

01:22.809 --> 01:24.141
Mariana:
Almost there!

01:24.143 --> 01:25.159
A little to the left!
Oh, you're so close.

01:25.235 --> 01:25.918
Yes, yes, yes!
Go deeper, go deeper!

01:25.995 --> 01:27.536
Yes, yes, yes! You got it!

01:29.573 --> 01:29.872
Evan:
That was very satisfying.

01:31.575 --> 01:31.999
Thank you.

01:33.577 --> 01:35.336
You know,
it's just a prototype.

01:35.412 --> 01:35.753
We need money
to actually develop it.

01:37.006 --> 01:38.246
I thoroughly enjoyed it.

01:38.324 --> 01:39.581
It was smart
to start with
something small.

01:39.659 --> 01:42.159
I know you want
to set yourself up
for success.

01:42.161 --> 01:43.602
Not dive in already
over your head.

01:45.848 --> 01:47.431
Yeah. That was
really good advice.

01:49.335 --> 01:50.092
Hey, mind if I grab
something to eat?

01:50.169 --> 01:50.443
Uh, of course.

01:51.687 --> 01:54.229
(dramatic music playing)

02:11.040 --> 02:12.956
Uh, what about
in-app purchases?

02:13.860 --> 02:13.949
For breakfast?

02:15.194 --> 02:18.787
Do you... want some socks?
The floor is cold.

02:18.865 --> 02:20.122
Oh. No, I'm good, thanks.

02:20.199 --> 02:21.131
Well, as I was saying,

02:22.385 --> 02:22.925
in-app purchases--

02:25.037 --> 02:28.463
They account for 48.2%
of all mobile app earnings
every year,

02:28.541 --> 02:30.224
over 37 billion dollars.

02:31.210 --> 02:31.600
Spoons?

02:33.045 --> 02:34.061
The second drawer
to the right
of the refrigerator.

02:39.568 --> 02:42.644
The more in-app purchases,
the more rewards.

02:42.722 --> 02:45.164
It all leads to
a massive dopamine release,

02:45.241 --> 02:47.649
which in turn leads
to more in-app purchases.

02:47.727 --> 02:48.242
But is it ethical?

02:53.232 --> 02:54.656
Well,
you'll be hard-pressed

02:54.734 --> 02:56.008
to find a VC willing
to invest in an idea

02:56.085 --> 02:58.844
that doesn't commit
to maximum revenue.

02:58.921 --> 03:01.347
Mmm-hmm.

03:01.424 --> 03:02.131
And a massive waste
of people's money.

03:03.743 --> 03:03.966
I'm gonna
get you some socks.

03:05.411 --> 03:05.518
Don't want you
to catch a cold.

03:10.933 --> 03:14.527

03:14.603 --> 03:16.770

03:35.291 --> 03:35.706
What you smiling at?

03:37.109 --> 03:38.867
Oh, um,

03:38.945 --> 03:39.385
I'm in this competition
with Dyonte.

03:41.038 --> 03:45.040
Every year, our interns come up
with their own mini-campaign

03:45.117 --> 03:46.633
that complements
the larger work of DPN.

03:46.710 --> 03:48.227
So you both should be thinking
on what you want to do.

03:48.304 --> 03:49.303
In the meantime,

03:49.379 --> 03:51.789
we have a town hall meeting
coming up.

03:51.791 --> 03:53.457
I need each of you

03:53.459 --> 03:55.234
to make at least 50 calls
from our call list.

03:55.311 --> 03:57.478
-Got it.
-On it. Cool.

03:57.554 --> 03:58.312
I'm gonna make
100 calls to your 50.

03:58.388 --> 03:59.521
Ooh! Okay.

04:01.650 --> 04:03.300
You're on.
But what do I get
if I win?

04:03.302 --> 04:03.734
You won't.

04:07.139 --> 04:08.581
Isaac:
I didn't realize, uh,

04:08.657 --> 04:11.158
the non-profit world
was so competitive.

04:11.235 --> 04:12.918
Well, I mean,
they only choose
one of the interns

04:12.995 --> 04:14.753
to be a full-time organizer
each year.

04:14.830 --> 04:14.979
Isaac:
Sounds kinda cutthroat.

04:16.573 --> 04:17.481
Kinda like trying to get
in a shower around here.

04:17.483 --> 04:18.332
(chuckles)
Yeah.

04:19.910 --> 04:20.667
You, uh...

04:22.154 --> 04:22.753
You given it
any thought?

04:23.990 --> 04:24.546
Us moving in together?

04:26.675 --> 04:28.842
Um...

04:28.919 --> 04:29.602
have you talked to
your therapist about that?

04:32.665 --> 04:33.222
Moving in with someone
can be stressful.

04:34.424 --> 04:36.000
Isaac:
Speaking of which...

04:36.002 --> 04:37.100
I noticed you haven't
really been sleeping well
at night.

04:38.337 --> 04:39.019
Oh, yeah. I'm good.

04:39.855 --> 04:40.395
Right.

04:42.599 --> 04:43.449
But you know,
a lot has happened.

04:45.011 --> 04:46.619
And it's over.

04:46.695 --> 04:49.121
They dropped my charges.
So I'm a free woman.

04:52.184 --> 04:52.199
I know.
I'm just talking about
in your life.

04:53.686 --> 04:56.453
You know, maybe
you should talk
to someone too.

04:58.024 --> 04:58.956
I don't need to.
My work is my therapy.

05:01.193 --> 05:03.043
You know, you don't
always have to do
for everybody else.

05:03.120 --> 05:04.461
You can ask for help.

05:05.789 --> 05:06.463
-You said that.
-I know.

05:07.199 --> 05:09.466
(phone buzzing)

05:12.204 --> 05:13.704
Hey, girl, what's up?

05:13.706 --> 05:16.982
Yvonne: (over phone)
<i>  Hey, girl,</i>
<i>  can you do me a favor?</i>

05:17.059 --> 05:18.876
<i>  Can you watch my kids</i>
<i>  for a couple of hours</i>
<i>  this morning?</i>

05:18.878 --> 05:20.635
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
For sure. I got you.

05:20.713 --> 05:21.820
<i>  Ahh, thanks, girl.</i>

05:21.897 --> 05:22.729
<i>  I'll see you soon.</i>

05:22.806 --> 05:23.397
(video call ringing)

05:25.475 --> 05:25.991
Sorry. Did I wake you?

05:27.477 --> 05:28.827
<i>  It's okay.</i>
<i>  How you doing?</i>

05:30.890 --> 05:31.664
I'm just checking in.

05:31.740 --> 05:33.666
I wanted to say
good morning.

05:33.701 --> 05:33.949
Dennis:<i>  I'm doing okay.</i>

05:34.910 --> 05:35.325
Honestly.

05:36.745 --> 05:37.160
I've been...

05:38.655 --> 05:39.913
spending a lot of time
in nature,

05:39.990 --> 05:43.233
<i>  taking hikes,</i>
<i>  going to the beach.</i>

05:43.235 --> 05:44.418
I think this is just
what I needed.

05:46.997 --> 05:47.170
(clears throat)
That's good.

05:49.499 --> 05:49.848
I miss you.

05:52.244 --> 05:52.843
I miss you too.

05:56.006 --> 05:57.839
Hi, uh, my name's
Callie Adams Foster.

05:57.917 --> 06:02.102
I'm trying to track down
a family member
of Jerod Murphy's.

06:02.179 --> 06:04.088
I believe
you're his sister.

06:04.090 --> 06:05.531
If you could just return
my call on this number

06:05.608 --> 06:06.699
or, uh, my office...

06:07.927 --> 06:08.534
I'd like to discuss

06:08.611 --> 06:10.369
his situation with you.

06:10.446 --> 06:10.869
Thank you.

06:12.765 --> 06:13.530
What was that about?

06:15.101 --> 06:16.709
Uh, the ADA offered Jerod
a plea deal

06:16.785 --> 06:19.453
in which he could be
out in 30 days.

06:19.529 --> 06:20.938
Now that
Kathleen smells money,

06:20.940 --> 06:23.273
she suddenly wants
to go to trial

06:23.275 --> 06:24.124
which means that Jerod
could be stuck in jail

06:24.201 --> 06:24.958
for over a year

06:25.035 --> 06:26.209
just waiting
on a court date.

06:27.613 --> 06:28.703
Well, what does he want?

06:28.781 --> 06:30.614
I don't know.

06:30.616 --> 06:31.873
She doesn't want me
to tell him about the offer.

06:31.951 --> 06:32.466
Can she do that?

06:32.542 --> 06:33.058
No.

06:34.286 --> 06:36.211
I mean, not ethically.

06:36.288 --> 06:38.956
Her whole argument is...

06:38.958 --> 06:40.624
that Jerod's not capable
of making the right decisions
for himself.

06:40.626 --> 06:42.476
Which is why
I'm trying to track down
a family member.

06:44.054 --> 06:45.404
Does she know that
you're trying to find
his sister?

06:45.481 --> 06:48.890
No. I'm sure
she wouldn't be happy
about it,

06:48.968 --> 06:49.399
but I don't know
what else to do.

06:50.986 --> 06:51.234
Sounds like
you don't trust her.

06:55.641 --> 06:56.898
You know,
when I quit Legal Aid,

06:56.976 --> 06:57.732
Marcus told me that

06:57.810 --> 06:58.917
she left her old firm

06:58.994 --> 06:59.409
under shady circumstances.

07:00.996 --> 07:03.372
And the whole reason
I took this job
was to help Jerod.

07:05.909 --> 07:06.500
I mean, what if I made
a huge mistake?

07:11.157 --> 07:11.171
Yvonne:
Thank you so much for this.

07:12.825 --> 07:15.250
The kids don't have school
and my mom got called
into work.

07:15.327 --> 07:16.769
It's no problem at all.

07:16.845 --> 07:18.253
She's off at noon
and she'll come get them.

07:18.330 --> 07:19.012
It's all good.
I love kids.

07:20.590 --> 07:21.589
You be good
for Malika, okay?

07:21.667 --> 07:22.432
Okay.

07:24.353 --> 07:24.893
Bye, honey.

07:28.023 --> 07:28.563
Hormones.

07:30.009 --> 07:30.449
Be good too.

07:33.345 --> 07:34.602
Bye, girl.
Thank you.

07:34.680 --> 07:35.070
No problem.

07:37.183 --> 07:39.607
So... What do you all want
to do today?

07:39.685 --> 07:41.034
I've got
to go potty.

07:42.037 --> 07:42.536
Okay.

07:43.780 --> 07:44.963
Can you, uh, watch Shine

07:45.040 --> 07:46.523
while I take your sister
to the bathroom?

07:46.525 --> 07:46.998
I'm not
the babysitter.

07:52.789 --> 07:54.089
(indistinct chatter)

08:01.040 --> 08:02.472
Hey. How's it going?

08:03.375 --> 08:05.542
Ugh, Gael's running late.

08:05.544 --> 08:09.213
Oh. Well, you just
missed a very awkward

08:09.215 --> 08:10.656
and off-key singing
of<i>  Happy Birthday</i>

08:10.733 --> 08:11.473
for Principal Solomon.

08:11.550 --> 08:12.232
Oh, thank God.

08:13.810 --> 08:15.994
But the cupcakes
weren't that bad.

08:17.223 --> 08:18.222
So I brought you one.

08:18.224 --> 08:19.723
I hope you like vanilla.

08:19.725 --> 08:21.575
I love anything
that's sweet and frosted.

08:21.651 --> 08:22.000
Thank you.

08:23.820 --> 08:25.078
Hey, guys.
Sorry I'm late.

08:25.155 --> 08:28.415
Davia: Hey, uh, Gael,
this is Matt. He teaches math.

08:28.492 --> 08:30.400
He is fine!

08:30.402 --> 08:31.918
Why you think
I got us kicked out
of class?

08:31.995 --> 08:33.512
Well, I should go
teach some algebra.

08:33.589 --> 08:34.179
Ooh, have fun
with that.

08:36.075 --> 08:39.834
This internship
is kicking my ass.

08:39.912 --> 08:41.520
It's supposed to be at night

08:41.597 --> 08:43.188
and he's got me doing all
of his errands during the day.

08:43.265 --> 08:44.189
Well, tell him no.

08:44.266 --> 08:46.141
I can't.
I gotta pay my dues.

08:48.011 --> 08:50.270
Oh, also you...
forgot your lunch at home

08:50.347 --> 08:51.346
on the kitchen counter.

08:51.423 --> 08:52.364
Thank you.

08:52.441 --> 08:55.609
Did you hear that?
They live together.

08:55.685 --> 08:57.870
No way a guy that fine
is hooking up

08:57.946 --> 09:00.205
with someone as fat
and as basic as Ms. Moss.

09:00.282 --> 09:02.040
(Jessie and Nyah laughing)

09:05.954 --> 09:06.870
I know you're not talking,
Jessie.

09:08.865 --> 09:10.532
It's not like your fat ass
is anything special.

09:10.609 --> 09:12.542
Yeah, Jessie.
How about you go find
some clothes that fit?

09:14.204 --> 09:15.629
And deprive you of all this?

09:15.705 --> 09:16.630
You wish you could get
with a girl like me!

09:16.706 --> 09:17.339
Hey!

09:18.708 --> 09:19.299
That's enough! All of you!

09:22.304 --> 09:22.886
What is wrong with you?

09:25.974 --> 09:28.066
(sad music playing)

09:39.138 --> 09:42.656
Mariana:
Hey, so, how do we feel
about in-app purchases?

09:42.732 --> 09:44.491
Shouldn't be too hard
to add it into the pitch deck
before tomorrow.

09:44.568 --> 09:45.900
But is it right?

09:45.978 --> 09:47.402
With ACT-ivism,
we were trying

09:47.479 --> 09:49.146
to do something good
in the world. This...

09:49.148 --> 09:50.330
Is... necessary.

09:51.908 --> 09:55.319
No VC's gonna invest
if we're not
maximizing profits.

09:55.321 --> 09:56.595
We need seed money,

09:56.672 --> 09:59.656
and then we can focus
on developing the big ideas

09:59.658 --> 10:00.507
that we actually care about.

10:00.584 --> 10:01.049
(phone chimes)

10:02.511 --> 10:03.769
Claire: Did you know
that Evan Speck was

10:03.846 --> 10:07.013
one of the co-founders
of this app called Day Trader?

10:07.090 --> 10:08.665
I read an article
where they admitted

10:08.667 --> 10:09.591
that they knew nothing
about the stock market,

10:09.668 --> 10:11.768
but they thought
it was a big idea.

10:12.504 --> 10:13.612
So they pitched it,

10:13.689 --> 10:15.397
and they figured it out
after they got funded.

10:17.009 --> 10:17.765
Really?

10:17.843 --> 10:20.193
Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah.

10:20.270 --> 10:21.862
Because, men.

10:21.938 --> 10:22.779
Because, men.

10:25.775 --> 10:27.351
It was smart
to start with
something small.

10:27.353 --> 10:28.869
I know you want
to set yourself up
for success.

10:28.945 --> 10:30.579
Not dive in already
over your head.

10:32.207 --> 10:32.581
(phone chimes)

10:36.953 --> 10:38.211
Does the question mark mean,

10:38.288 --> 10:39.805
how does that sound to me?

10:41.367 --> 10:41.882
Or is it meant
to be sarcastic?

10:55.881 --> 10:57.823
Are you mad at me?

11:00.977 --> 11:01.568
Uh-- Don't send.

11:04.390 --> 11:04.571
Why would she be mad at me?

11:06.909 --> 11:07.782
-(door opens)
-Shine: Ah!

11:10.896 --> 11:12.504
Hi, I'm calling from
Dignity and Power Now.

11:12.581 --> 11:13.997
We're having
a town hall meeting...

11:15.158 --> 11:16.824
Is she okay?

11:16.902 --> 11:18.668
(playful music playing)

11:20.906 --> 11:22.572
(yelps)

11:22.574 --> 11:23.331
A little help--
Oh, no, ma'am, not you.

11:23.409 --> 11:25.183
Shine! Shine!

11:27.170 --> 11:28.687
I'm sorry.
Can I call you back?

11:28.764 --> 11:29.179
(mouths)
Thank you.

11:32.251 --> 11:33.308
Gotcha!

11:34.920 --> 11:36.753
-I'm so sorry.
-She's a bad person.

11:36.755 --> 11:37.437
I'm not a bad person.

11:37.514 --> 11:38.422
Let me go.

11:38.424 --> 11:39.689
Let me... go!

11:41.944 --> 11:42.592
Is this apple juice?

11:42.594 --> 11:43.777
No, no, no, honey.

11:43.853 --> 11:45.946
-This is grown-up juice. Okay?
-(phone ringing)

11:47.190 --> 11:49.374
Hey!

11:49.451 --> 11:51.952
-Yvonne: (over phone)
<i>  Hey, how's it going?</i>
<i> </i> -Good.

11:52.028 --> 11:54.287
<i>  Listen, my mom just got</i>
<i>  asked to do a double.</i>

11:54.364 --> 11:56.106
<i>  I hate to ask</i>
<i>  but would you mind</i>

11:56.108 --> 11:58.216
<i>  keeping the kids</i>
<i>  until I'm off work?</i>

11:58.293 --> 12:00.201
<i>  -I should be there by 6:00.</i>
<i> </i> -6:00?

12:00.279 --> 12:01.002
<i>  You don't know</i>
<i>  how much I appreciate it.</i>

12:02.706 --> 12:04.130
Sure.

12:04.207 --> 12:06.874
-No problem.
<i>  -Thank you.</i>

12:06.952 --> 12:08.376
No, no. It's fine.
We'll-- We'll see you later.

12:08.454 --> 12:09.302
<i>  -Okay, bye.</i>
<i> </i> -Okay.

12:10.622 --> 12:12.230
Don't tell me.
Something's come up

12:12.307 --> 12:15.125
and she's dumping us
with another stranger
for the rest of the day?

12:15.127 --> 12:16.293
But I'm not a stranger.

12:16.295 --> 12:16.851
We don't know you.

12:19.147 --> 12:20.238
Oh, No, no. Nisa.

12:21.967 --> 12:22.732
Give me that. Thank you.

12:24.486 --> 12:26.470
You suck as a babysitter.

12:26.472 --> 12:27.304
You know,
you could help out.

12:27.306 --> 12:28.246
You sound like Yvonne.

12:28.323 --> 12:29.915
You mean your mother?

12:29.992 --> 12:30.582
-Wish she wasn't.
-Hey!

12:31.994 --> 12:32.976
You need
to check your attitude

12:32.978 --> 12:34.035
and stop being
such a little shit!

12:38.484 --> 12:38.665
She's doing
the best she can.

12:42.412 --> 12:42.877
(sighs)

12:45.324 --> 12:47.749
Why don't you... color?

12:47.826 --> 12:48.767
I have
all these art supplies.

12:48.844 --> 12:50.585
I wanna go swimming!

12:50.662 --> 12:52.587
Yeah! Swimming!

12:52.664 --> 12:54.514
Both (chanting):
Swimming!

12:56.852 --> 12:57.943
Okay, okay, okay.

12:59.671 --> 13:00.437
Hey!

13:01.673 --> 13:03.398
Uh, are you busy
right now?

13:07.362 --> 13:09.179
Heard you're going
to trial with that case
you brought in.

13:09.181 --> 13:09.571
Possible settlement.

13:11.033 --> 13:11.740
Way to kill it,
Impulse Buy.

13:16.371 --> 13:17.963
Hey, so, any idea

13:18.040 --> 13:19.297
why Kathleen
left the firm she built?

13:20.950 --> 13:24.027
I think she just got
tired of representing
rich people.

13:24.029 --> 13:25.211
So you just
followed her blindly,

13:25.288 --> 13:25.637
no questions asked?

13:27.883 --> 13:30.291
A friend of mine
was fired from his job
when he transitioned.

13:30.369 --> 13:31.793
No one would represent him
at the firm

13:31.870 --> 13:32.302
because he couldn't pay.

13:34.389 --> 13:35.889
Kathleen took
his case pro bono
and won.

13:37.376 --> 13:37.599
So you owe her.

13:38.544 --> 13:39.726
I'm not here
because I owe her.

13:41.304 --> 13:42.562
I'm here
because I want to be her.

13:42.639 --> 13:43.155
She's brilliant.

13:44.883 --> 13:45.323
And she cares.

13:48.053 --> 13:49.736
What about you?

13:49.813 --> 13:51.646
I don't do
anything blindly.

13:51.723 --> 13:52.238
I want to learn
from the best.

13:53.559 --> 13:54.074
Why'd you take
this job?

13:56.895 --> 13:57.243
So she'd represent
my client.

13:59.064 --> 14:00.505
Well, then,
your client's lucky
to have her.

14:11.259 --> 14:11.674
Dyonte: Hey.

14:13.412 --> 14:13.843
(clears throat)

14:15.004 --> 14:15.854
Oh!

14:18.842 --> 14:19.349
You do need help.

14:21.344 --> 14:21.851
A man to the rescue.

14:23.105 --> 14:23.520
Of course.

14:25.924 --> 14:26.364
(whispers)
Wow!

14:30.929 --> 14:32.704
Watch out!

14:32.781 --> 14:34.364
("Nothin' Bout Me"
by Alex Beaumont playing)

14:39.362 --> 14:40.537
Kiara, you sure
you don't want to come in?

14:43.366 --> 14:44.541
-(playful shouting)
-(splashing)

14:55.804 --> 14:56.394
I'm sorry I snapped
at you earlier.

14:57.973 --> 14:59.722
That was more me
being a little shit.

15:05.981 --> 15:06.571
All I had was my mom
growing up,

15:08.558 --> 15:10.300
and she wasn't
around a lot either.

15:10.302 --> 15:12.235
She was always working or...

15:13.989 --> 15:14.571
doing other things.

15:17.734 --> 15:18.158
I wanted her
to do stuff with me.

15:21.813 --> 15:22.420
We were supposed
to go shopping today.

15:24.741 --> 15:26.091
It's like
she's never home,

15:26.168 --> 15:27.208
but when she is,
she's tired.

15:28.987 --> 15:29.377
It's tough.

15:32.248 --> 15:33.323
But your mama loves you,

15:33.325 --> 15:34.766
and she's doing
everything she can

15:34.843 --> 15:37.719
to take care of you
and your brother and sister
all alone.

15:40.924 --> 15:42.849
I know it doesn't feel
like enough right now,

15:45.003 --> 15:45.727
but she's really trying
her best.

15:50.358 --> 15:51.191
I'm not really
a little shit, you know?

15:51.267 --> 15:52.951
(chuckles)
I know. Me neither.

15:56.848 --> 15:57.280
I was gonna go put
my feet in the pool.

15:58.441 --> 15:58.740

Come in.

16:24.801 --> 16:25.391
Hey.

16:27.470 --> 16:27.986
I just wanted
to see if you're okay.

16:29.898 --> 16:30.063
(voice breaking):
Yeah, I'm fine.

16:32.217 --> 16:33.641
I can imagine
that it's hard

16:33.719 --> 16:35.068
not letting
those kids get to you.

16:35.144 --> 16:36.110
No, it's not about them.

16:38.573 --> 16:39.831
It's-- It's Dennis.

16:44.487 --> 16:45.337
I'm in love with him.

16:49.993 --> 16:51.417
And he told me
that he loved me
and then we...

16:54.906 --> 16:55.180
And then the next morning,
he took off.

16:58.243 --> 16:58.925
What if he realized,
after we had sex,

17:00.336 --> 17:00.927
that he doesn't love me,

17:02.414 --> 17:02.687
you know, like that.

17:04.916 --> 17:06.340
You've seen
the girls he dates.

17:06.418 --> 17:09.085
What if I'm...
too thick for him?

17:09.087 --> 17:10.845
No, Davia, don't do that
to yourself.

17:10.922 --> 17:12.772
You are beautiful
and sexy.

17:12.849 --> 17:14.682
Okay, no offense,
but the hot guy

17:14.760 --> 17:16.034
reassuring the big girl
that she's beautiful

17:16.111 --> 17:17.260
is sort of gag inducing.

17:17.262 --> 17:19.362
All right,
don't take it from me.

17:20.599 --> 17:22.282
Take it from her.

17:35.947 --> 17:36.629

17:36.706 --> 17:37.705
She's pretty hot.

17:37.783 --> 17:39.799
And I am so turned on
by that woman.

17:39.876 --> 17:41.208
That woman is you.

17:41.286 --> 17:42.394
Okay, now
you're making it weird.

17:42.470 --> 17:42.844
(both chuckle)

17:44.881 --> 17:45.847
I just thought
I was past all this shit.

17:47.383 --> 17:49.734
You know, then I hear
my mother's voice
in my head

17:49.811 --> 17:50.101
telling me that...

17:51.630 --> 17:52.904
I could have
any guy I wanted
if I just lost weight.

17:54.132 --> 17:57.801
Or how lucky I am
to have any guy love me.

17:57.803 --> 17:58.401
Who cares if he's married?

18:02.307 --> 18:03.740
I'm supposed to be
the body positive girl.

18:07.904 --> 18:08.420
And you are.

18:10.482 --> 18:11.205
Davia, you're also human.

18:12.651 --> 18:14.167
Dennis hurt you.

18:14.243 --> 18:15.209
I don't think he meant to,

18:17.155 --> 18:18.596
but he rattled
your confidence.

18:18.673 --> 18:20.423
Made you forget
who you are for a second.

18:22.828 --> 18:23.343
Have you told him
how you feel?

18:24.830 --> 18:25.720
No, I can't.

18:26.848 --> 18:28.273
He's already so fragile.

18:30.168 --> 18:30.933
I'm just scared
I'd make things worse...

18:32.337 --> 18:33.061
or push him away.

18:34.506 --> 18:36.522
I get that,

18:36.599 --> 18:37.899
but you can't always try
to protect his feelings.

18:39.177 --> 18:42.011
'Cause then who's gonna
take care of yours?

18:42.013 --> 18:42.287
Well, I'm tough.

18:44.699 --> 18:45.623
If I can handle a room
full of eighth graders,

18:45.700 --> 18:47.350
I can handle anything.

18:47.352 --> 18:48.701
Yeah, that's true,

18:48.778 --> 18:49.794
but you don't always have
to be tough.

18:52.207 --> 18:52.914
Thank you.

18:55.543 --> 18:57.710
And thanks for helping
with the kids.

18:57.787 --> 18:59.137
Hey, what are friends for?

19:00.715 --> 19:02.699
And as your friend,
I'm telling you,

19:02.701 --> 19:05.218
you can't work
12 hours a day for free.

19:05.294 --> 19:07.645
Unless, you know,
one of those hours
is for me at school.

19:10.709 --> 19:11.708
You know, but seriously,
this artist guy--

Yuri Ellwin.

19:13.228 --> 19:14.652
He's a big deal
in the art world.

19:14.729 --> 19:16.045
Yeah, well,
he doesn't mean shit
in my world.

19:16.047 --> 19:19.140
So, he has no right
to take advantage of you.

19:19.217 --> 19:21.067
Even if you are paying
your dues,

19:21.144 --> 19:21.734
you need to set

19:31.897 --> 19:32.578
No worries.
I'm glad
you called.

19:34.657 --> 19:34.672
I had an ulterior motive.

19:36.159 --> 19:38.918
If I couldn't make calls,
I didn't want you to either.

19:38.995 --> 19:40.011
Well, I am aware.

19:42.165 --> 19:43.181
And apparently, I'm not
as good with kids
as I thought.

19:44.242 --> 19:44.516
That's not true.

19:46.244 --> 19:47.593
Looks like you broke through
with Kiara.

19:47.670 --> 19:49.020
She reminds me
of myself as a kid.

19:50.765 --> 19:52.173
I was pretty angry
with my mother.

19:52.250 --> 19:54.584
She struggled
with alcohol and drugs.

19:54.586 --> 19:56.528
And she let us down,
a lot.

19:59.424 --> 20:00.924
Got to the point,
I called child services,

20:00.926 --> 20:03.317
and me and Dom
ended up in foster care
until we aged out.

20:06.264 --> 20:06.612
I feel you.

20:08.691 --> 20:10.875
I moved around a lot,

20:10.952 --> 20:12.326
lived with aunts
and my grandmother
for a time.

20:13.438 --> 20:14.787
When you have family
in the system,

20:17.292 --> 20:17.790
it all hits harder
for the moms, I think.

20:19.778 --> 20:22.462
They have
such little support
in the community,

20:22.538 --> 20:23.054
no safety net.

20:25.633 --> 20:27.892
That's why this work
is so healing.

20:27.969 --> 20:28.726
It is.

20:31.623 --> 20:32.897
But it can also bring up
past feelings,

20:32.974 --> 20:33.398
you know, trauma.

20:35.794 --> 20:36.734
Doesn't hurt to talk
to someone.

20:36.811 --> 20:37.961
Like in therapy?

20:37.963 --> 20:39.979
I mean,
what have you got to lose?

20:41.132 --> 20:41.739
My money.

20:41.816 --> 20:42.740
♪

20:44.469 --> 20:45.910
Whatever.
I'll think about it.

20:45.987 --> 20:46.135
I can give you
a number or two.

20:48.231 --> 20:48.913
-You see a therapist?
-A couples counselor.

20:51.734 --> 20:52.325
In the past?

20:54.145 --> 20:54.494
In the present.

21:00.076 --> 21:00.541
So, you're
in a relationship?

21:02.153 --> 21:04.821
So, what, you've been
hustling me this whole time?

21:04.823 --> 21:06.322
Trying to flirt with me

21:06.324 --> 21:07.840
so I could be
your side piece?

21:07.917 --> 21:09.550
Oh, so you think
I've been flirting with you?

21:10.753 --> 21:12.220
Okay.
For real?

21:14.757 --> 21:15.106
I like you.

21:17.502 --> 21:18.851
I think
you're passionate
and smart,

21:18.928 --> 21:20.261
not to mention
beautiful and sexy,

21:20.338 --> 21:22.021
and I just feel you.

21:22.098 --> 21:24.023
-You just said
you're in a relationship.
-I am.

21:25.693 --> 21:27.026
But we're not exclusive.

21:27.103 --> 21:29.603
(scoffs) So you're in
an open relationship?

21:29.681 --> 21:30.738
Not open. Poly.

21:32.608 --> 21:34.517
We don't just
play around.

21:34.519 --> 21:34.742
In fact,
she has another
boyfriend.

21:36.688 --> 21:37.203
So the real question is...

21:39.040 --> 21:39.455
why have you been
flirting with me?

21:47.382 --> 21:49.382
♪

21:59.544 --> 22:00.226
(phone chimes)

22:07.719 --> 22:08.475
You ready for this?

22:08.553 --> 22:10.144
Drill Down Baby.

22:10.221 --> 22:10.611
Both: We got this.

22:13.649 --> 22:15.816
Well...
(chuckles)

22:15.894 --> 22:18.152
If it isn't Spartacus,
Spartacus, Spartacus,

22:18.229 --> 22:19.653
and, uh, Spartacus.

22:19.731 --> 22:20.672
What are you
doing here?

22:20.748 --> 22:21.564
We're pitching
an idea.

22:21.566 --> 22:23.066
Ah!

22:23.068 --> 22:27.070
Heard you staged
a melodramatic walkout
at Speckulate.

22:27.072 --> 22:27.461
It's probably PMS.

22:28.998 --> 22:31.182
I heard that it spreads
between other women.

22:31.259 --> 22:33.076
My mom calls it, uh,
"Syncing cycles."

22:33.078 --> 22:34.093
Why are you talking
to your mom about periods?

22:34.170 --> 22:35.261
Why wouldn't I?

22:35.338 --> 22:37.096
Well...
if you'll excuse us,

22:37.173 --> 22:38.598
we have glass ceilings
to shatter.

22:38.674 --> 22:40.341
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Good luck.

22:40.418 --> 22:41.250
Though I doubt
they'll be looking

22:41.252 --> 22:43.252
for any more
female content.

22:43.254 --> 22:45.254
We just sold an AR app

22:45.256 --> 22:46.847
that's gonna redefine
interior decorating

22:46.925 --> 22:49.033
for the everyday woman.

22:49.110 --> 22:52.353
Curtains, ladders
to hang blankets on.

22:52.430 --> 22:53.520
Balls of twine
in a basket.

22:53.598 --> 22:55.281
Books
arranged by color.

22:55.358 --> 22:56.874
You know, stuff
normal women like.

22:56.951 --> 22:58.451
Do you even know
any women outside of work?

22:58.527 --> 22:59.026
Besides your mom.

22:59.104 --> 23:00.378
I love my mom.

23:00.455 --> 23:03.439
I know women make
more in-app purchases
than men.

23:03.441 --> 23:04.290
-Yeah.
-We'll figure out the rest.

23:08.796 --> 23:10.555
Well... congrats.

23:10.632 --> 23:12.298
Thank you.

23:12.375 --> 23:14.450
That's
very gracious of you...

23:14.452 --> 23:14.892
Mari-anna.

23:22.218 --> 23:24.068
They'll "figure out
the rest"?

23:24.145 --> 23:24.644
(scoffs)
Of course they will.

23:26.297 --> 23:29.056
Because men trust
that men will figure it out.

23:29.134 --> 23:30.391
Oh, no, but they think
that we need to start small,

23:30.468 --> 23:31.909
that we shouldn't
get in over our heads,

23:31.986 --> 23:32.243
that we should
eat dinner at 11:00...

23:34.489 --> 23:36.063
(exhales sharply)

23:36.141 --> 23:37.073
You know what?
Screw it.

23:39.735 --> 23:40.418
Let's pitch
Bulk Beauty.

23:42.664 --> 23:44.647
We don't have
a deck prepared.

23:44.649 --> 23:46.573
And that was my fault.

23:46.651 --> 23:46.832
I made us all afraid
to pitch the big idea.

23:48.319 --> 23:50.595
Meanwhile, these two morons
don't know the first thing

23:50.672 --> 23:51.988
about AR
or home decorating,

23:51.990 --> 23:53.247
and they got funding.

23:53.324 --> 23:54.915
But I-- I bet
they had a deck.

23:54.993 --> 23:55.424
We don't need a deck.

23:56.085 --> 23:57.493
We've got passion.

23:57.495 --> 23:59.178
And we've already
worked through
most of the concept.

24:00.665 --> 24:03.924
We've all been conditioned
not to believe in ourselves.

24:04.002 --> 24:05.518
That women can't be bold,

24:05.594 --> 24:06.944
that we have to walk
before we can run.

24:07.021 --> 24:10.097
But how can we except anyone
to believe that we're capable

24:10.175 --> 24:11.282
if we can't
believe it ourselves?

24:11.359 --> 24:13.342
So, yeah,

24:13.344 --> 24:13.943
I believe that we
can pitch Bulk Beauty.

24:15.513 --> 24:16.621
And then
we'll figure out the rest.

24:19.442 --> 24:21.017
So, we're taking a break
from our art projects.

24:21.019 --> 24:22.518
Today, we're gonna give

24:22.520 --> 24:22.952
our restorative justice circle
another go.

24:24.689 --> 24:25.855
First of all,
I want to apologize

24:25.857 --> 24:27.373
to all of you.

24:27.450 --> 24:28.858
I lost my temper
yesterday,

24:28.860 --> 24:29.041
and I shouldn't have
done that.

24:30.528 --> 24:31.861
Meeting aggression
with aggression

24:31.863 --> 24:33.863
is exactly what
gets us all into trouble

24:33.865 --> 24:36.090
and isn't what
restorative justice
is all about.

24:38.203 --> 24:38.634
Jessie...

24:40.038 --> 24:42.555
you really hurt
my feelings yesterday.

24:42.631 --> 24:43.931
You made a judgment
based off of my appearance.

24:45.543 --> 24:46.818
And I don't think
it's very kind

24:46.894 --> 24:47.977
to say anything
about the way people look.

24:49.047 --> 24:50.563
I... I know.

24:52.066 --> 24:52.815
I'm sorry.

24:54.219 --> 24:54.734
Thank you.

24:56.070 --> 24:56.494
I accept your apology.

24:59.073 --> 24:59.613
And, Andre...

25:02.227 --> 25:04.502
I think it's obvious
what you said to Jessie
was hurtful to her.

25:04.579 --> 25:06.653
I was defending you.

25:06.731 --> 25:07.672
Yeah, by hurting
someone else.

25:07.749 --> 25:08.731
You know,
it reminded me

25:08.733 --> 25:10.916
of when I was
in middle school,

25:10.993 --> 25:12.752
mean kids, mainly boys,

25:12.828 --> 25:13.678
used to make fun of my body.

25:15.831 --> 25:17.573
I would let the things
they said about me

25:17.575 --> 25:18.340
lower my self-esteem.

25:20.745 --> 25:21.185
Jessie:
I get made fun of too...

25:23.172 --> 25:23.512
for the way I look.

25:26.251 --> 25:27.183
And when
it happens in class,

25:29.254 --> 25:30.361
it makes some
of the teachers notice me.

25:32.090 --> 25:35.349
And because of how
my clothes fit,

25:35.426 --> 25:37.351
or how my bra strap shows
because it's wider,

25:37.428 --> 25:39.537
sometimes the boys
like to snap them...

25:41.266 --> 25:43.023
and make comments
on how big my boobs are

25:43.101 --> 25:43.532
or my ass is.

25:45.103 --> 25:46.452
Then the teachers
call me out

25:46.529 --> 25:46.544
for inappropriate attire.

25:47.955 --> 25:50.498
I'm wearing the same thing
as the other girls are.

25:51.943 --> 25:52.291
But for me...

25:53.444 --> 25:54.001
it's a strike.

25:57.540 --> 25:58.130
And it hurts.

26:06.048 --> 26:06.680
Anything you want
to say, Andre?

26:10.886 --> 26:11.310
I'm sorry.

26:16.392 --> 26:17.358
(school bell ringing)

26:23.808 --> 26:24.365
Hey, Andre.

26:26.402 --> 26:26.992
Your words
have a lot of power.

26:28.404 --> 26:30.646
And the other boys
are gonna follow
your example

26:30.648 --> 26:31.872
because
you are a leader.

26:33.334 --> 26:34.667
You can use
your influence

26:34.743 --> 26:36.427
to have a positive effect
on the school,

26:36.504 --> 26:37.044
if you choose to.

26:38.747 --> 26:39.421
I said I was sorry.

26:49.925 --> 26:51.183
Kathleen:
You reached out
to Jerod's sister?

26:53.504 --> 26:54.946
I thought his family
should be notified

26:55.022 --> 26:56.280
about his situation.

26:56.357 --> 26:59.024
Family
can complicate matters.

26:59.101 --> 26:59.733
But I haven't
heard back from her.

27:00.678 --> 27:02.178
I did.

27:02.180 --> 27:02.453
She called the office.

27:03.364 --> 27:05.030
She's in the conference room.

27:09.020 --> 27:10.294
Let's see if she's here
to derail us, shall we?

27:14.375 --> 27:15.691
Jerod had
his first manic episode

27:15.693 --> 27:16.458
at college.

27:17.695 --> 27:18.544
And then
our mother died,

27:19.788 --> 27:22.531
and he started
having hallucinations.

27:22.533 --> 27:23.866
It was
a really hard time,

27:23.868 --> 27:25.476
but we got him stable
with the right meds.

27:27.205 --> 27:27.961
And he got a job,
he got his own place.

27:28.039 --> 27:29.138
He was doing really well.

27:30.466 --> 27:30.481
And then he turned 27,

27:31.893 --> 27:34.226
and he got kicked off
our dad's health insurance.

27:36.047 --> 27:38.063
Without his meds,
he ended up on the street,

27:38.140 --> 27:40.157
and... we just--

27:40.234 --> 27:40.566
We lost touch with him.

27:42.403 --> 27:42.735
I should have
tried harder
to find him.

27:44.389 --> 27:46.163
Kathleen:
Without access

27:46.240 --> 27:48.148
to the right medication
and treatment,

27:48.226 --> 27:49.283
there is only so much
families can do.

27:50.561 --> 27:52.077
You can't blame yourself,

27:52.154 --> 27:52.837
but you can
blame the system.

27:54.990 --> 27:56.582
So you think a trial
is the best option?

27:56.659 --> 28:00.236
I do. If we can get
a settlement out of it,

28:00.238 --> 28:01.679
with that kind of money,
he could get an apartment,

28:03.241 --> 28:04.757
and get the medical care
he needs.

28:04.833 --> 28:05.850
A chance
at a good life again.

28:07.094 --> 28:08.911
But it also means

28:08.913 --> 28:09.854
that he could be in jail
for up to a year,

28:09.931 --> 28:10.521
awaiting trial.

28:15.436 --> 28:16.694
(scoffs)
Is there another option?

28:25.187 --> 28:29.432
They've offered a plea deal
of 30 days plus time served.

28:29.434 --> 28:32.043
But that means
he'll have to plead guilty

28:32.119 --> 28:33.452
and he'll have a record.

28:33.529 --> 28:35.046
Which means the next time
they pick him up,

28:35.122 --> 28:36.789
he's already a felon.

28:36.865 --> 28:38.607
Which means
harsher treatment,

28:38.609 --> 28:40.776
harsher charging.

28:40.778 --> 28:42.962
And if he gets
two more serious felonies,

28:43.038 --> 28:44.296
that's three strikes,

28:44.373 --> 28:45.381
and he's looking
at 25 years to life.

28:53.140 --> 28:54.056
I guess a trial
is the best option then.

28:55.977 --> 28:58.051
Good. I'm glad
we're on the same page.

28:58.129 --> 28:58.894
Zoe:
Well, not all of us.

29:01.148 --> 29:02.073
Jerod needs to know
all the options because...

29:03.634 --> 29:04.233
ultimately,
the decision is his.

29:08.063 --> 29:10.322
Do you think that he

29:10.399 --> 29:12.741
is capable of making decisions
on his own behalf?

29:15.646 --> 29:15.661
I think we need
to be really careful...

29:17.164 --> 29:20.082
when we assume
mentally ill people
are not capable

29:21.652 --> 29:22.651
and we take away
their right

29:22.653 --> 29:24.261
to advocate
on their own behalf.

29:34.832 --> 29:35.014
How'd it go with,
uh, Yvonne's kids?

29:36.425 --> 29:39.760
-It was a little rough at first.
-(chuckles) Yeah.

29:39.837 --> 29:40.728
But, um, then Dyonte
came over and helped out.

29:42.523 --> 29:43.856
You called
Dyonte over?

29:43.932 --> 29:45.024
Yeah, I had to make sure

29:45.100 --> 29:47.434
he didn't have time
to make any DPN calls.

29:47.512 --> 29:48.193
I play to win.

29:49.180 --> 29:50.070
Yeah.

29:51.824 --> 29:52.790
And you have nothing
to worry about.

29:54.852 --> 29:55.743
So the real question
is...

29:57.355 --> 29:58.037
why have you been
flirting with me?

30:01.526 --> 30:02.916
(sighs)

30:04.862 --> 30:07.454
-Are you and Isaac--
-No. We're not.

30:07.532 --> 30:08.472
And I'm sorry
if I gave you
that impression.

30:10.718 --> 30:11.383
One relationship
is enough for me.

30:13.721 --> 30:14.887
In fact,
we're moving in together.

30:17.208 --> 30:17.765
Okay.

30:19.377 --> 30:19.892
That's cool.

30:21.970 --> 30:22.561
I respect that.

30:29.220 --> 30:29.568
He has a girlfriend,

30:31.647 --> 30:32.613
and you are
my one and only.

30:37.228 --> 30:38.318
You know, uh, I talked
to my therapist today

30:38.396 --> 30:40.153
about us
moving in together.

30:40.231 --> 30:41.005
Yeah, um...

30:42.416 --> 30:43.990
I wanted to talk
about that.

30:44.068 --> 30:45.843
Yeah, I mean,
she was basically saying
what you were saying.

30:48.089 --> 30:49.755
Probably too stressful
right now.

30:49.832 --> 30:51.006
A little too soon
with everything going on.

30:53.244 --> 30:54.426
Probably should, uh...
Probably should wait.

30:56.747 --> 30:57.763
-Yeah, agreed.
-Yeah.

30:58.841 --> 30:58.972
For future references,

31:00.418 --> 31:02.918
just give your man
a chance to show up
for you,

31:02.920 --> 31:04.195
when you need help.

31:04.271 --> 31:04.978
Call me next time.

31:06.774 --> 31:07.364
Okay.

31:12.930 --> 31:14.038
-So?
-So, um...

31:15.266 --> 31:18.283
Zoe and I went
to see Jerod together,

31:18.360 --> 31:19.210
just explained
all his options.

31:21.914 --> 31:22.704
And he decided
he wants to go to trial.

31:24.959 --> 31:27.218
So, I, uh... I drafted
these questions

31:27.294 --> 31:30.203
for Deputy Gaffney
and the other deputies involved

31:30.281 --> 31:31.538
for our interviews
with them.

31:31.616 --> 31:32.673
We won't
be interviewing them.

31:34.135 --> 31:35.634
-Why not?
-It's a waste of time.

31:35.711 --> 31:36.844
They'll be well prepared
and they'll lie.

31:38.472 --> 31:39.396
Okay, but if we want
to impeach them--

31:39.473 --> 31:41.123
We'll do it on the stand.

31:41.125 --> 31:43.292
We don't need to give them
a preview of our strategy,

31:43.294 --> 31:43.934
and you have to stop
second guessing me.

31:45.312 --> 31:46.570
-I wasn't trying to--
-(loudly) And stop talking!

31:48.098 --> 31:50.741
This is your third job
since you graduated law school.

31:50.818 --> 31:53.802
You quit your clerkship
with a federal appeals judge.

31:53.804 --> 31:54.245
You quit Legal Aid.

31:56.064 --> 31:58.082
And if you ever go
behind my back again,

31:58.159 --> 32:00.233
calling family members
and contradicting my advice,

32:00.311 --> 32:03.078
you'll be looking
for your fourth job
since you graduated.

32:05.741 --> 32:08.408
And good luck getting anyone
to take a chance on you

32:08.486 --> 32:09.084
with a record like that.

32:12.414 --> 32:12.930
I'm sorry.

32:16.585 --> 32:19.928
I got the judge
to agree to move Jerod
to an IMD.

32:22.166 --> 32:24.833
Institute for Mental Disease,
while he awaits trial.

32:24.835 --> 32:27.686
He'll get treatment
and he'll be safe.

32:27.763 --> 32:29.605
It's no Sandals,
but it's much better
than jail.

32:31.509 --> 32:33.008
Now,
that is great news.

32:33.010 --> 32:34.601
You know, I was never going

32:34.679 --> 32:35.786
to let him
sit in jail, Callie.

32:38.941 --> 32:42.534
I also got a new DA
on your Yvonne Byers case.

32:42.611 --> 32:44.853
So, hopefully, they'll stop
giving you the runaround.

32:44.855 --> 32:45.245
Thank you.

32:48.859 --> 32:51.284
I really do appreciate

32:51.362 --> 32:53.378
the opportunity
to learn from you.

32:53.455 --> 32:54.805
In order for this
to work, Callie,

32:54.882 --> 32:55.306
you're gonna have
to trust me.

32:57.626 --> 32:57.975
Can you do that?

33:00.128 --> 33:01.537
Yes.

33:01.539 --> 33:01.762
Good.

33:03.374 --> 33:07.818
Do a deep dive
into Deputy Gaffney's
social media postings.

33:07.895 --> 33:09.878
You'd be surprised
what those guys brag about

33:09.880 --> 33:10.988
or downright admit to.

33:11.065 --> 33:11.563
Will do.

33:19.557 --> 33:20.489
I lied. I am mad at you.

33:27.732 --> 33:28.172
Why are you mad?

33:30.568 --> 33:31.333
You told me
that our idea
was too big.

33:32.586 --> 33:33.344
That we should
start small.

33:33.420 --> 33:34.661
But that's
not what you did

33:34.739 --> 33:35.921
when you and your partners
started Day Trader.

33:37.165 --> 33:38.498
So why didn't you think

33:38.576 --> 33:38.682
that we could
figure it out on our own?

33:40.836 --> 33:40.926
Because
it was really hard.

33:42.429 --> 33:45.247
Oh, so women can't
figure things out
that are hard?

33:45.249 --> 33:45.856
-Is that it?
-No.

33:48.176 --> 33:49.601
I meant...

33:49.678 --> 33:49.851
it was stressful.

33:51.088 --> 33:54.106
I mean, we bit off
more than we could chew.

33:54.182 --> 33:55.107
We ended up
hating each other.

33:55.183 --> 33:56.683
That's why
the team broke up.

33:56.761 --> 33:58.277
Yes, we--
We got lucky,

33:58.353 --> 33:59.261
but we could have
just as easily failed,

33:59.263 --> 34:00.862
and I didn't want that
for you.

34:02.099 --> 34:03.282
Well, our only failure

34:03.358 --> 34:06.543
was not believing
in our idea or ourselves.

34:06.620 --> 34:06.994
So what did you do?

34:08.773 --> 34:10.047
We pitched
Bulk Beauty.

34:11.292 --> 34:11.707
And they bought it?

34:15.629 --> 34:17.780
Maybe we should've
pitched the game.

34:17.782 --> 34:21.041
Hey. Even if we had
pitched the game
and sold it,

34:21.118 --> 34:23.060
you think we'd
feel much better
than we do now?

34:23.137 --> 34:24.061
We'd feel like
we could pay rent
next month.

34:25.790 --> 34:26.179
Yeah, but how excited
would we be?

34:27.625 --> 34:31.126
That pitch
was good today.
And with zero prep.

34:31.128 --> 34:31.977
Think about how much better
we'll be next time

34:32.054 --> 34:33.395
when we're
actually prepared.

34:34.648 --> 34:36.131
So there's a next time?

34:36.133 --> 34:37.466
Men don't quit
when they fail.

34:37.468 --> 34:39.318
A lot of them
fail their way
straight to the top.

34:41.639 --> 34:42.863
We can't quit
after one pass.

34:45.492 --> 34:46.533
No, but...

34:48.145 --> 34:48.276
we're not
gonna give up.

34:50.664 --> 34:50.996
Good.

34:52.499 --> 34:55.926
You know, maybe
on the next pitch,
you should consider--

34:56.003 --> 34:56.877
If this is ever
going to work,

34:58.413 --> 34:59.504
we can
never talk business.

35:01.158 --> 35:02.433
Well-- I--

35:02.509 --> 35:06.086
You just-- You can't help
but be brutally honest,

35:06.163 --> 35:08.555
and I can't help
but be swayed
by your opinion.

35:10.184 --> 35:11.016
So I need you
to respect
my boundaries.

35:12.427 --> 35:12.851
That's fair.

35:16.674 --> 35:17.614
Since you
brought it up, um...

35:19.360 --> 35:20.951
I have a few boundaries
I need you to respect.

35:22.196 --> 35:22.944
Sure.

35:25.273 --> 35:27.015
I need you to put
everything in the fridge

35:27.017 --> 35:28.158
back in the precise place
that you found it.

35:29.353 --> 35:31.520
-I could do that--
-And to wear socks.

35:31.522 --> 35:31.962
Always.

35:33.524 --> 35:35.190
And to squeeze the toothpaste
from the bottom,

35:35.192 --> 35:36.967
not strangle it
from the middle.

35:37.044 --> 35:38.877
In fact, everything
in my loft has its place,

35:38.954 --> 35:39.544
so I just need you
to not move anything.

35:40.956 --> 35:41.472
Ever.

35:45.035 --> 35:46.310
Okay. Got it.
Sorry.

35:48.055 --> 35:49.538
I know that sounds silly.

35:49.540 --> 35:49.980
It's just, um...

35:51.375 --> 35:51.815
at work,

35:52.877 --> 35:53.892
I have to tolerate

35:53.969 --> 35:55.644
so many things
that are out of my control.

35:57.047 --> 35:59.231
Like things
that cause anxiety

35:59.307 --> 36:00.640
and actual physical pain.

36:00.718 --> 36:01.650
So at home...

36:04.905 --> 36:04.995
I need order.

36:06.223 --> 36:08.891
So I can have
one place in this world

36:08.893 --> 36:09.741
where I feel safe.

36:12.396 --> 36:12.786
Like how I feel with you.

36:15.824 --> 36:15.997
You know,
when you're not...

36:17.325 --> 36:17.833
moving all my stuff around.

36:22.589 --> 36:23.505
Well...

36:25.075 --> 36:26.007
I'm happy
you feel safe with me.

36:28.670 --> 36:30.262
(upbeat music playing)

36:46.280 --> 36:47.779
(music continues)

36:51.285 --> 36:52.993
(panting)

36:54.288 --> 36:55.361
It's time then, huh?

36:55.439 --> 36:55.454
Yeah.

36:56.941 --> 36:59.383
All right, don't forget.
There's a list on the desk.

36:59.460 --> 37:00.041
Things for tomorrow.

37:02.279 --> 37:04.871
Uh... actually,

37:04.949 --> 37:07.048
I'm not available
to run errands
during the day.

37:10.304 --> 37:11.787
Is that right?

37:11.789 --> 37:14.898
Well, it wasn't really
part of the job description.

37:14.975 --> 37:16.183
We said five hours
at night.

37:18.796 --> 37:20.979
I have another job
during the day.

37:21.056 --> 37:23.407
And I'm helping out
a friend,

37:23.484 --> 37:25.225
teaching restorative justice
through art

37:25.302 --> 37:25.742
at a middle school.

37:28.138 --> 37:28.737
Well, I could talk
to the kids if you like.

37:32.309 --> 37:33.867
Tell them what it takes
to be a famous artist.

37:35.570 --> 37:36.495
Uh...

37:38.148 --> 37:39.739
Sure. That'd be--
That'd be great.

37:39.817 --> 37:40.373
Yeah, I know.

37:42.319 --> 37:43.835
So you don't do errands.

37:45.990 --> 37:46.755
Do you paint at least?

37:48.659 --> 37:49.758
-Yeah.
-Good.

37:51.328 --> 37:52.677
Well, then,
I want you to paint...

37:54.422 --> 37:55.555
those canvasses over there
just like this one.

37:58.852 --> 38:00.110
I'm sorry, you want me
to paint for you?

38:02.339 --> 38:05.007
Yeah, well,
if you'd been observant,

38:05.009 --> 38:07.067
you should be able
to mimic my style by now.

38:08.512 --> 38:08.735
It's just
the backgrounds.

38:10.014 --> 38:10.621
Good lad.

38:13.851 --> 38:15.283
(phone ringing)

38:17.354 --> 38:18.328
Dennis: (on video call)
<i>  Hey.</i>

38:18.405 --> 38:19.445
<i>  Did you get my video?</i>

38:19.523 --> 38:19.913
Davia:
I did.

38:21.358 --> 38:21.798
Um...

38:25.287 --> 38:26.044
I need
to tell you something.

38:27.698 --> 38:28.463
<i>  Okay.</i>

38:31.035 --> 38:33.293
Dennis, I'm really hurt

38:33.370 --> 38:34.144
and angry with you.

38:37.799 --> 38:39.891
(indistinct chatter)

38:43.547 --> 38:43.979
You sure you're up for this?

38:46.383 --> 38:46.940
Yeah.

38:53.390 --> 38:55.240
(upbeat music playing)

39:05.736 --> 39:07.836
(music continues)

39:12.076 --> 39:14.242
Yo, are you wearing a bra?

39:14.244 --> 39:16.336
Yo, dude. Look at this.
That is hysterical!

39:16.413 --> 39:17.762
No, it's not.

39:17.839 --> 39:18.747
And if you
or anybody else

39:18.749 --> 39:20.348
snaps her bra straps
or mine,

39:22.252 --> 39:22.767
I will end you.

39:25.089 --> 39:27.756
-All right, bro. My bad.
-Okay, man.

39:27.758 --> 39:29.149
Go ahead. Cool. Cool.

39:31.095 --> 39:32.277
What's going on, there?

39:33.855 --> 39:34.362
(proudly):
Restorative justice.

39:36.266 --> 39:37.708
I knew you'd
be good at this.

39:37.784 --> 39:39.192
Well, Andre just said
he'd end a kid,

39:39.269 --> 39:41.036
so it's a work in progress,
but thank you.

39:42.456 --> 39:42.954
You're welcome.

39:49.129 --> 39:50.721
Dyonte:
Dignity and Power, yes...

39:50.797 --> 39:53.056
Dyonte, D-Y-O-N-T-E.

39:53.133 --> 39:55.617
Well? Will you?

39:55.619 --> 39:56.618
Yeah, that'd be great,
if we can--

39:56.620 --> 39:57.052
Of course!

39:59.456 --> 40:01.047
How'd the calls go?

40:01.125 --> 40:01.389
It was a pleasure,
Miss Montinez. Thank you.

40:02.717 --> 40:03.400
Just got my 50.

40:05.295 --> 40:06.069
Um, I'm actually gonna need
some more time.

40:07.889 --> 40:09.740
A friend I met in holding
reached out

40:09.816 --> 40:10.741
and she needed someone
to watch her kids.

40:10.817 --> 40:11.316
I'm sorry.

40:11.985 --> 40:14.077
Don't be sorry.

40:14.154 --> 40:15.320
Supporting people
tied up in the system

40:15.397 --> 40:17.472
is what we do here.

40:17.474 --> 40:18.531
Thanks. It did
give me an idea
for my mini-campaign.

40:20.160 --> 40:22.994
Dyonte and I were talking about
how women with family in prison

40:23.071 --> 40:24.237
don't have enough support.

40:24.314 --> 40:26.906
So what if we could
fund a childcare program?

40:26.984 --> 40:28.091
For when they have
to make appearances in court

40:28.168 --> 40:30.427
or do community service

40:30.504 --> 40:32.412
or visit a loved one
in prison.

40:32.489 --> 40:34.747
I love it.
Run with it.

40:34.825 --> 40:35.924
Okay, I will.
Thank you.

40:39.921 --> 40:40.437
That's a great idea.

40:41.832 --> 40:42.347
Thanks.

40:44.001 --> 40:44.516
Let me know
how I can support you.

40:45.852 --> 40:46.559
Okay, I will.

40:49.523 --> 40:51.173
We good?

40:51.175 --> 40:51.940
Yeah. Why wouldn't we be?

Okay, um...

40:55.846 --> 40:57.404
I have a couple
of therapists' numbers
for you.

41:00.350 --> 41:01.107
Thanks, but this campaign
is going to be

41:01.185 --> 41:01.741
all the therapy I need.

41:07.949 --> 41:09.357
It's a good sign.

41:09.359 --> 41:11.134
-At least they're not
rescheduling again.
-Yeah.

41:19.386 --> 41:19.718
What are you
doing here?

41:21.296 --> 41:23.146
I work here now
as a DDA.

41:23.223 --> 41:24.222
This is my case.
