WEBVTT

00:03.375 --> 00:05.711
THE MANDALORIAN:
You have something I want.

00:07.463 --> 00:09.173
BO-KATAN:
I can lead you to one of their kind.

00:10.090 --> 00:12.092
But first,
we need your help on our mission.

00:12.176 --> 00:14.303
The Darksaber. Does he have it?

00:14.386 --> 00:15.554
-

00:15.846 --> 00:19.433
DR. PERSHING: We have exhausted
our initial supply of blood.

00:19.517 --> 00:22.686
I highly doubt we'll find a donor
with a higher M-count, though.

00:23.479 --> 00:25.147
AHSOKA TANO: Go to the planet Tython.

00:25.231 --> 00:27.024
You will find
the ancient ruins of a temple

00:27.107 --> 00:29.401
that has a strong connection to the Force.

00:29.485 --> 00:32.154
Place Grogu on the seeing stone
at the top of the mountain.

00:32.571 --> 00:34.281
If he reaches out through the Force,

00:34.365 --> 00:38.327
there's a chance a Jedi may sense
his presence and come searching for him.

00:38.410 --> 00:42.289
Then again, there aren't many Jedi left.

00:55.094 --> 00:57.012
THE MANDALORIAN:
You may think you have some idea

00:57.096 --> 00:58.597
of what you are in possession of,

00:58.681 --> 00:59.932
but you do not.

01:01.058 --> 01:02.852
It means more to me

01:02.935 --> 01:04.478
than you will ever know.

01:51.066 --> 01:52.401
What's going on? Who are they?

01:52.484 --> 01:55.070
I suggest you shut your mouth,
this isn't your laboratory.

02:12.838 --> 02:14.340
They hit us with an ion cannon.

02:15.007 --> 02:16.217
Avionics are down.

02:17.426 --> 02:18.677
Comms are down!

02:19.178 --> 02:22.723
BOBA FETT: Lower your shields,
disengage all transponders,

02:23.224 --> 02:24.308
prepare for boarding.

02:24.391 --> 02:26.185
They're pirates. Shouldn't we fight?

02:26.268 --> 02:28.312
I don't have a death wish, do you?

02:54.505 --> 02:57.299
Before you make a mistake,
this is Dr. Pershing.

02:57.925 --> 03:00.094
We've met. Is the kid alive?

03:05.015 --> 03:06.016
Stay back, Dropper.

03:06.600 --> 03:07.935
Easy, pal. Okay?

03:08.727 --> 03:10.646
I'm not with him.
We can work something out.

03:14.024 --> 03:15.025
Drop your weapon.

03:16.110 --> 03:17.611
No. No, you listen to me.

03:17.695 --> 03:20.197
This is a top-tier target
of the New Republic.

03:20.281 --> 03:22.074
This is a clone engineer.

03:22.157 --> 03:25.661
And if they find out that
he's dead because of you,

03:26.620 --> 03:28.789
you're gonna wish you never left Alderaan.

03:30.165 --> 03:31.458
I saw the tear.

03:32.793 --> 03:34.086
You wanna know what else I saw?

03:35.504 --> 03:38.048
I saw your planet destroyed.

03:40.467 --> 03:41.760
I was on the Death Star.

03:42.553 --> 03:43.596
Which one?

03:45.222 --> 03:47.016
You think you're funny?

03:47.099 --> 03:49.935
Do you know how many millions
were killed on those bases?

03:51.395 --> 03:52.605
Drop your blaster.

03:52.688 --> 03:53.814
As the galaxy cheered?

03:53.898 --> 03:55.024
Last chance.

03:55.566 --> 04:01.614
Destroying your planet was a small price
to pay to rid the galaxy of terrorism.

04:02.156 --> 04:03.782
-

05:36.709 --> 05:38.043
THE MANDALORIAN: I need your help.

05:39.503 --> 05:41.964
Not all Mandalorians are bounty hunters.

05:43.382 --> 05:45.092
Some of us serve a higher purpose.

05:46.051 --> 05:47.386
They took the Child.

05:48.762 --> 05:49.763
Who?

05:50.306 --> 05:51.307
Moff Gideon.

05:53.475 --> 05:54.476
You'll never find him.

05:57.271 --> 05:58.689
BOBA FETT: We don't need these two.

05:58.772 --> 05:59.857
Let's get outta here.

06:02.860 --> 06:04.904
You are not a Mandalorian.

06:04.987 --> 06:06.363
BOBA FETT: Never said I was.

06:07.615 --> 06:09.533
I didn't know sidekicks
were allowed to talk.

06:12.328 --> 06:15.414
Well, if that isn't the Quacta
calling the Stifling slimy.

06:17.249 --> 06:19.084
Easy there, little one.

06:19.168 --> 06:21.587
You'll be talking through
the window of a bacta tank.

06:21.670 --> 06:24.089
All right, easy. Save it for the Imps.

06:27.051 --> 06:28.552
We have his coordinates.

06:28.969 --> 06:30.846
You can bring me to Moff Gideon?

06:31.430 --> 06:32.973
The Moff has a light cruiser.

06:33.724 --> 06:36.519
It could be helpful in your effort
to regain Mandalore.

06:36.602 --> 06:39.396
BOBA FETT:
You gotta be kidding me. Mandalore?

06:40.564 --> 06:42.650
The Empire turned that planet to glass.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.819
You are a disgrace to your armor.

06:47.238 --> 06:49.573
BOBA FETT:
This armor belonged to my father.

06:49.990 --> 06:51.492
Don't you mean your donor?

06:52.451 --> 06:53.536
Careful, princess.

06:54.995 --> 06:56.288
You are a clone.

06:57.957 --> 07:00.876
I've heard your voice thousands of times.

07:00.960 --> 07:03.295
Mine might be the last one you hear.

07:23.148 --> 07:25.109
Enough! Both of you!

07:25.192 --> 07:27.278
If we had shown
half that spine to the Empire

07:27.361 --> 07:29.321
we would've never lost our planet.

07:34.869 --> 07:35.911
We will help you.

07:37.329 --> 07:40.374
In exchange, we will keep that ship
to retake Mandalore.

07:41.041 --> 07:43.836
If you should manage to finish your quest,

07:43.919 --> 07:46.839
I would have you reconsider
joining our efforts.

07:47.631 --> 07:51.677
Mandalorians have been in exile
from our home world for far too long.

07:52.511 --> 07:54.597
-Fair enough.
-One more thing.

07:55.014 --> 07:57.683
Gideon has a weapon
that once belonged to me.

07:58.642 --> 08:01.312
It is an ancient weapon
that can cut through anything.

08:01.896 --> 08:02.897
Almost anything.

08:03.981 --> 08:05.816
It cannot cut through pure beskar.

08:07.318 --> 08:10.613
I will kill the Moff
and retake what is rightfully mine.

08:11.906 --> 08:13.991
With the Darksaber restored to me,

08:14.742 --> 08:17.786
Mandalore will finally be within reach.

08:18.746 --> 08:21.874
Help me rescue the Child
and you can have whatever you want.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.502
He is my only priority.

08:35.679 --> 08:37.765
This is Moff Gideon's
Imperial light cruiser.

08:37.848 --> 08:40.226
In the old days,
it would carry a crew of several hundred.

08:40.309 --> 08:42.478
Now it operates with
a tiny fraction of that.

08:42.561 --> 08:45.147
-Your assessment is misleading.
-CARA: Oh, great.

08:45.856 --> 08:47.358
An objective opinion.

08:47.441 --> 08:49.360
This isn't subterfuge. I assure you.

08:49.443 --> 08:50.528
Let him speak.

08:50.611 --> 08:53.781
There's a garrison
of dark troopers on board.

08:53.864 --> 08:55.407
They abducted the Child.

08:55.491 --> 08:57.826
How many troopers do they have
armed in those suits?

08:58.661 --> 09:02.206
These are third-generation design.
They are no longer suits.

09:02.915 --> 09:05.292
The human inside was the final weakness
to be solved.

09:06.293 --> 09:07.294
They're droids.

09:09.463 --> 09:10.798
Where are they bivouacked?

09:13.133 --> 09:14.802
DR. PERSHING:
They're held in cold storage

09:14.885 --> 09:16.011
in this cargo bay.

09:17.263 --> 09:19.390
They draw too much power
to be kept at ready.

09:19.473 --> 09:20.850
FENNEC SHAND: How long to power up?

09:20.975 --> 09:22.810
A few minutes, perhaps.

09:22.893 --> 09:24.854
THE MANDALORIAN:
Where is the Child being held?

09:25.938 --> 09:26.981
This is the brig.

09:28.274 --> 09:30.234
He's being held here under armed guard.

09:31.026 --> 09:33.362
Very well. We split into two parties.

09:33.445 --> 09:34.864
THE MANDALORIAN:
I go alone.

09:35.406 --> 09:36.740
Fine.

09:36.824 --> 09:39.702
Phase one,
Lambda shuttle issues a distress call.

09:39.785 --> 09:42.913
Two, we emergency land
at the mouth of the fighter launch tube,

09:42.997 --> 09:44.832
cutting off any potential interceptors.

09:44.915 --> 09:48.627
Koska, Fennec, Dune and myself disembark
with maximum initiative.

09:48.711 --> 09:52.381
Once we've neutralized the launch bay,
we make our way through these tandem decks

09:52.464 --> 09:53.883
in a penetration maneuver.

09:53.966 --> 09:56.510
-THE MANDALORIAN: And me?
-We'll be misdirection.

09:57.469 --> 10:01.182
Once we draw a crowd,
you slip through the shadows, get the kid.

10:01.891 --> 10:05.186
Those dark troopers
are gonna be a real skank in the scud pie.

10:06.854 --> 10:08.731
Their bay is on the way to the brig.

10:09.356 --> 10:11.066
Can he make it there before they deploy?

10:11.442 --> 10:12.651
It's possible.

10:13.319 --> 10:16.739
Here. Take his code cylinder
and seal off their holding bay.

10:17.323 --> 10:19.617
Anyone else, we can handle.

10:20.743 --> 10:21.994
We'll meet at the bridge.

10:33.589 --> 10:35.090
BO-KATAN:
Moff Gideon is mine.

10:36.217 --> 10:37.218
Got it?

10:37.301 --> 10:39.803
He's ex-ISB.
He's got a lot of information.

10:40.888 --> 10:41.889
I need him alive.

10:41.972 --> 10:45.267
I don't care what happens to him
as long as he surrenders to me.

10:45.351 --> 10:46.977
Prepare to exit jump space.

10:47.061 --> 10:48.437
BO-KATAN: Copy that.

10:48.521 --> 10:50.940
Get the hell out of there
as soon as they clear us to dock.

10:51.023 --> 10:52.900
And your shots
have to look convincing.

10:52.983 --> 10:56.320
Power up those shields, princess.
I'll put on a good show.

10:56.403 --> 10:58.113
Watch out for those deck cannons.

10:58.822 --> 11:01.909
Don't worry about me.
Just be careful in there.

11:01.992 --> 11:05.496
Exiting hyperspace in three, two, one...

11:22.847 --> 11:24.974
BO-KATAN: This is Lambda shuttle,
Two-Seven-Four-Three.

11:25.057 --> 11:26.642
Requesting emergency docking.

11:33.816 --> 11:35.901
Repeat,
requesting emergency docking.

11:35.985 --> 11:38.237
We are under attack.

11:38.320 --> 11:40.239
Copy, Lambda shuttle. Request received.

11:40.322 --> 11:41.699
Launch TIE fighters.

11:43.033 --> 11:45.828
Stay clear of launch tube.
Deploying fighter squadron.

12:21.906 --> 12:25.284
Request denied! Please clear launch tube
until fighters deploy!

12:25.367 --> 12:27.703
BO-KATAN: Negative! Negative!
We are under attack!

12:32.750 --> 12:34.335
Clear launch tube immediately.

12:34.418 --> 12:36.712
We have incoming at two-eight-four-six.

12:36.795 --> 12:38.130
Hangar control, stand down!

12:38.547 --> 12:39.882
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:58.275 --> 12:59.401
Hang on!

13:00.736 --> 13:01.862
STORMTROOPER 1: Look out.

13:22.842 --> 13:24.468
STORMTROOPER 2: Clear the launch tube!

13:24.552 --> 13:25.803
STORMTROOPER 3: What are you doing?

13:25.886 --> 13:27.471
-Get that thing out of here!
-

13:27.847 --> 13:29.139
STORMTROOPER 4: Move in! Blast 'em!

13:38.107 --> 13:39.316
Fire!

13:43.779 --> 13:44.780
STORMTROOPER 5: Wait, stop!

13:44.864 --> 13:46.407
Activate the dark troopers.

14:34.288 --> 14:35.289
KOSKA REEVES: All clear.

14:36.332 --> 14:37.458
BO-KATAN: A little too clear.

14:40.252 --> 14:41.378
Keep your eyes open.

14:58.145 --> 15:00.648
STORMTROOPER 1: Freeze! Drop your weapons!

15:01.732 --> 15:03.400
Sector four, hold your position.

15:25.005 --> 15:26.715
STORMTROOPER 2:
We're heading to the bridge now.

15:58.539 --> 15:59.790
Cover me.

15:59.874 --> 16:00.958
BO-KATAN: We got your back.

16:02.626 --> 16:04.545
-

16:35.826 --> 16:37.119
STORMTROOPER: There they are!

17:08.859 --> 17:10.027
My gun's jammed!

17:10.110 --> 17:11.237
I got you.

17:22.540 --> 17:23.541
Thanks.

17:44.728 --> 17:46.272
No. No!

18:29.982 --> 18:31.734
-

19:24.537 --> 19:25.579
Dank farrik!

19:28.249 --> 19:29.542
Son of a mudscuffer!

19:30.459 --> 19:32.211
BO-KATAN: Are you sure
you don't need any help?

19:32.378 --> 19:33.796
-

19:33.879 --> 19:37.174
I think that did it. Excuse me.

19:38.342 --> 19:39.677
STORMTROOPER: Hostiles! Stop!

19:59.697 --> 20:01.323
KOSKA REEVES: Weapons system disarmed.

20:03.826 --> 20:05.160
Where's Gideon?

20:37.860 --> 20:39.153
Drop the blaster.

20:43.490 --> 20:44.491
Slowly.

20:48.078 --> 20:49.496
Now kick it over to me.

20:51.248 --> 20:52.249
Very nice.

20:53.334 --> 20:54.710
Give me the kid.

20:54.793 --> 20:56.504
The kid is just fine where he is.

21:00.299 --> 21:01.592
Mesmerizing, isn't it?

21:02.593 --> 21:03.844
Used to belong to Bo-Katan.

21:05.763 --> 21:08.182
Yes. I know you've been traveling
with Bo-Katan.

21:08.265 --> 21:12.269
A friendly piece of advice,
assume that I know everything.

21:12.353 --> 21:16.607
Like the fact that your wrist launcher
has fired its one and only salvo.

21:17.441 --> 21:18.484
Where is this going?

21:19.944 --> 21:21.654
This is where it's going.

21:22.112 --> 21:25.741
I'm guessing that Bo-Katan
and her boarding party

21:25.824 --> 21:32.414
have arrived at the bridge,
seeking me or, more accurately, this.

21:34.208 --> 21:35.459
But I'm not there.

21:36.961 --> 21:40.714
And I imagine that they've killed
everyone on the bridge,

21:40.798 --> 21:44.051
being the murderous savages that they are.

21:46.387 --> 21:48.472
And now, they're beginning to panic.

21:50.724 --> 21:53.936
You see, she wants this.

21:54.687 --> 21:55.688
Do you know why?

21:56.397 --> 21:57.731
Because it brings power.

22:00.985 --> 22:02.570
Whoever wields this sword...

22:03.279 --> 22:06.782
has the right to lay claim
to the Mandalorian throne.

22:08.534 --> 22:11.328
You keep it. I just want the kid.

22:18.002 --> 22:19.003
Very well.

22:21.046 --> 22:22.923
I've already got what I want from him.

22:23.841 --> 22:24.842
His blood.

22:25.342 --> 22:27.845
All I wanted was to study his blood.

22:28.429 --> 22:30.556
This Child is extremely gifted...

22:31.765 --> 22:33.726
and has been blessed with rare properties

22:33.809 --> 22:37.938
that have the potential
to bring order back to the galaxy.

22:47.156 --> 22:48.449
I see your bond with him.

22:52.870 --> 22:53.871
Take him,

22:54.830 --> 22:58.667
but you will leave my ship immediately
and we will go our separate ways.

24:13.450 --> 24:14.535
You're sparing my life?

24:15.703 --> 24:17.204
Well, this should be interesting.

24:45.441 --> 24:46.567
What happened?

24:47.610 --> 24:49.862
CARA: He brought him in alive,
that's what happened.

24:50.529 --> 24:53.199
And now the New Republic's
gonna have to double the payment.

24:53.282 --> 24:54.867
That's not what she's talking about.

24:57.912 --> 25:00.372
Why don't you kill him now and take it?

25:05.794 --> 25:07.046
It's yours now.

25:07.129 --> 25:08.172
THE MANDALORIAN: What is?

25:08.923 --> 25:12.134
The Darksaber. It belongs to you.

25:17.932 --> 25:20.267
THE MANDALORIAN:
Now... it belongs to her.

25:21.101 --> 25:23.020
She can't take it.

25:23.938 --> 25:26.607
It must be won in battle.

25:27.149 --> 25:30.277
In order for her
to wield the Darksaber again,

25:30.945 --> 25:33.739
she would need to defeat you in combat.

25:36.075 --> 25:37.993
I yield. It's yours.

25:38.536 --> 25:40.538
Oh, no.

25:43.290 --> 25:44.416
It doesn't work that way.

25:45.960 --> 25:49.588
The Darksaber doesn't have power.

25:49.672 --> 25:50.965
The story does.

25:51.465 --> 25:53.467
Without that blade,

25:54.134 --> 25:57.221
she's a pretender to the throne.

26:02.226 --> 26:03.227
He's right.

26:05.980 --> 26:07.523
THE MANDALORIAN:
Come on, just take it.

26:14.029 --> 26:15.906
Well, perhaps she'll get
another crack at it.

26:17.116 --> 26:19.076
FENNEC SHAND:
The ray shields have been breached.

26:19.159 --> 26:20.369
We're being boarded.

26:20.452 --> 26:21.495
How many life forms?

26:22.413 --> 26:23.497
None.

26:36.886 --> 26:39.138
You're about to face off
with the dark troopers.

26:40.306 --> 26:41.891
You had your hands full with one.

26:43.601 --> 26:46.145
Let's see how you do
against a platoon.

27:08.667 --> 27:10.127
BO-KATAN: They're headed this way.

27:36.946 --> 27:39.698
Don't worry, kid.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

28:00.678 --> 28:01.887
Seal the blast doors!

28:14.984 --> 28:16.110
They're here.

29:06.911 --> 29:09.538
You have an impressive
fire team protecting you.

29:12.666 --> 29:16.378
But I think we all know,
after a valiant stand,

29:16.837 --> 29:20.549
everyone in this room will be dead...

29:22.218 --> 29:23.219
but me...

29:24.512 --> 29:25.513
and the Child.

29:57.503 --> 29:58.671
An X-wing.

29:58.754 --> 30:02.132
One X-wing? Great. We're saved.

30:02.842 --> 30:04.677
Incoming craft, identify yourself.

30:33.747 --> 30:34.915
Why did they stop?

31:02.193 --> 31:03.402
BO-KATAN: A Jedi?

31:08.699 --> 31:10.826
-

31:54.161 --> 31:55.621
Drop it!

33:56.867 --> 33:58.494
THE MANDALORIAN: Open the doors.

34:02.289 --> 34:04.250
I said, open the doors.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.085
Are you crazy?

34:43.831 --> 34:45.457
THE MANDALORIAN:
Are you a Jedi?

34:46.375 --> 34:47.376
I am.

34:54.675 --> 34:55.676
Come, little one.

35:02.683 --> 35:04.268
He doesn't want to go with you.

35:06.103 --> 35:07.396
He wants your permission.

35:09.398 --> 35:10.774
He is strong with the Force,

35:11.775 --> 35:13.652
but talent without training is nothing.

35:15.613 --> 35:17.573
I will give my life
to protect the Child...

35:18.991 --> 35:21.285
but he will not be safe
until he masters his abilities.

35:36.008 --> 35:37.468
THE MANDALORIAN: Hey, go on.

35:38.552 --> 35:41.096
That's who you belong with.
He's one of your kind.

35:44.183 --> 35:45.351
I'll see you again.

35:46.810 --> 35:48.020
I promise.

36:31.730 --> 36:32.731
All right, pal.

36:34.567 --> 36:35.651
It's time to go.

36:42.157 --> 36:43.367
Don't be afraid.

38:02.112 --> 38:03.447
May the Force be with you.

42:03.562 --> 42:04.939
-
