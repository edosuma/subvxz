WEBVTT

00:33.000 --> 00:35.103
(train whistle blowing,
boy snickering)

00:48.916 --> 00:50.284
Jump.

00:50.284 --> 00:52.953
Somebody pass it
in the front.

00:52.953 --> 00:54.722
(snickering)

00:54.722 --> 00:57.658
MAN:
Dead unidentified female
victims in Los Angeles

00:57.658 --> 00:59.760
are often called
"Sally in the Alley."

00:59.760 --> 01:03.564
Our detectives wanted
to give this one a name.

01:03.564 --> 01:06.967
I took my boys out
to lunch the other day, right?

01:06.967 --> 01:09.137
And, uh,
Petey starts horsing around,

01:09.137 --> 01:10.804
juggling meatballs
up in the air.

01:10.804 --> 01:13.707
My little guy hates to be
upstaged by his brother,

01:13.707 --> 01:17.478
so he takes these peas and
starts shoving them up his nose.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.313
(laughing)
So, now it's official.

01:19.313 --> 01:22.049
The Moretta boys are banned
from Denny's for life.

01:22.049 --> 01:24.718
(laughing)

01:24.718 --> 01:26.053
Hey.

01:26.053 --> 01:27.855
What's the matter with you?

01:27.855 --> 01:31.259
Nothing.
No?

01:31.259 --> 01:33.427
So, when are you going
to get Tammy pregnant?

01:33.427 --> 01:34.895
No!

01:34.895 --> 01:36.797
No. We are not ready.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.199
(cell phone rings)

01:41.902 --> 01:45.306
Tammy?
Yeah.

01:45.306 --> 01:49.243
She wants this new
camera, the Hasselblad.

01:49.243 --> 01:52.413
It costs around $2,000.

01:52.413 --> 01:55.583
You serious?
Yeah.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.185
It's an expensive hobby, man.

01:57.185 --> 01:58.986
She's really good.
Yeah?

01:58.986 --> 01:59.953
It's kind of more
than a hobby.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.389
Really?
Yeah.

02:01.389 --> 02:04.225
Wow. 'Cause I've heard
you say that before.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.959
The potter's wheel?
Come on.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.695
Oh, I know, I know,

02:07.695 --> 02:09.997
but her photography's
really first-rate.

02:09.997 --> 02:11.332
She's got a great eye.

02:11.332 --> 02:12.966
(cell phone ringing)

02:12.966 --> 02:15.769
Don't know where we're
going to get the money.

02:15.769 --> 02:18.105
Yeah, I hear that.

02:18.105 --> 02:20.874
Moretta.

02:20.874 --> 02:22.676
Whoa, calm down, Pop.

02:22.676 --> 02:24.044
Look, she probably
just stopped off

02:24.044 --> 02:26.614
at a friend's house
after school.

02:26.614 --> 02:27.948
If you don't hear
from her in an hour,

02:27.948 --> 02:30.117
you give me a call, all right?

02:30.117 --> 02:32.520
Just calm down.

02:32.520 --> 02:33.454
All right.

02:33.454 --> 02:35.523
Everything all right?

02:35.523 --> 02:37.124
Yeah, man, yeah.
It's just my sister.

02:37.124 --> 02:40.127
She keeps
driving my parents crazy.

02:40.127 --> 02:44.265
They never know where she's
going or who she's going with.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.166
It's what teenagers
do, remember?

02:46.166 --> 02:48.168
(chuckling):
Yeah.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.403
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

02:49.403 --> 02:50.604
Sit down before
you take a tumble.

02:50.604 --> 02:51.839
Forget it.
He's going to fall.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.106
They never fall.

02:53.106 --> 02:56.777
See? Hey, would you put him
back wherever he came from?

02:56.777 --> 02:58.111
Hey!

02:58.111 --> 03:00.448
Photos and SID are here,
but the coroner's backed up.

03:00.448 --> 03:02.950
They don't know when
they're going to get here.
SAMMY: The shield?

03:02.950 --> 03:04.117
She's naked.

03:04.117 --> 03:05.386
She OD'd?

03:05.386 --> 03:07.288
No, no. Her fingernails
are broken in half.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.156
She got a rope
around her neck.

03:09.156 --> 03:10.658
Man.

03:10.658 --> 03:13.361
Clean-looking.
Not from the hood.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.395
You print her?

03:14.395 --> 03:15.529
Machine's not working.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.664
She's the coroner's problem now.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.466
NATE:
That could take days.

03:18.466 --> 03:20.501
Just take a couple headshots.

03:20.501 --> 03:21.702
Maybe Vice can ID her.

03:21.702 --> 03:22.836
KENNY:
Mrs. Vargas called it in,

03:22.836 --> 03:24.672
and she lives across
the alley in 3B.

03:24.672 --> 03:26.440
She thought she was just
a drunk sleeping it off,

03:26.440 --> 03:28.709
but when she didn't move
for 18 hours,

03:28.709 --> 03:30.244
she actually realized
something was wrong.

03:30.244 --> 03:31.879
All right. Like a naked girl
laying in an alley

03:31.879 --> 03:32.913
isn't enough of a tip-off.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.315
Hey, can you blame her?

03:34.315 --> 03:35.849
She didn't want to
miss her novelas.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.017
Before she called it in,

03:37.017 --> 03:38.919
she said she saw some kids,
ages ten, 11,

03:38.919 --> 03:40.888
fooling around in the alley,
taking pictures

03:40.888 --> 03:42.290
with their cell phones.

03:42.290 --> 03:44.024
Ten year old didn't do this.
Yeah.

03:44.024 --> 03:45.493
Bangers?

03:45.493 --> 03:47.761
No. They'd just
shoot her.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.397
This guy's
a professional.

03:49.397 --> 03:51.565
He tried to, uh, minimize
the trace evidence.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.534
He knew by the time
somebody called it in,

03:53.534 --> 03:54.768
the scene would
be contaminated.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.770
It's a defense
attorney's dream.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.606
Well, maybe
we can get lucky.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.007
Get a hit off
the nail scrapings.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.942
You know, from the rope,
we'll be able to tell

04:01.942 --> 04:03.744
what the guy's into.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.846
If it's nylon, it's boating.
If it's polyester, shipping.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.080
Polypropylene, fishing.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.149
You know, some rope
is sensitive to the cold.

04:09.149 --> 04:10.318
Another deteriorates

04:10.318 --> 04:12.453
under UV light, so...

04:13.587 --> 04:15.255
It's my Sex Crime days.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.758
I take back all the
crap I said about you.
Thank you.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.127
I'll call Homicide.
Ask them to give us a hand.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.295
All right.
Okay.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.897
So, how am I
doing so far?

04:23.897 --> 04:25.165
Excuse me?

04:25.165 --> 04:27.635
I'm hoping I pass
this lunch test.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.370
I can take you
on a real date.

04:29.370 --> 04:32.473
Oh. It's not that.
I just...

04:32.473 --> 04:35.008
I like to take things slow.

04:35.008 --> 04:35.976
Not over him, huh?

04:35.976 --> 04:37.911
We've all been there.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.315
So, what do you do?

04:41.315 --> 04:44.051
I work for the city.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.554
In what capacity?

04:46.554 --> 04:48.889
I'm an advocate
for the community.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.724
Advocate?

04:50.724 --> 04:53.193
Is that like a
social worker or...?

04:53.193 --> 04:55.729
You could say that.

04:55.729 --> 04:58.766
I got to tell you, Lydia,
I'm really enjoying this.

04:58.766 --> 05:00.768
Oh, really?

05:01.835 --> 05:03.036
Good.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.938
So, where do you live?

05:06.407 --> 05:08.576
I live with my mother.

05:08.576 --> 05:10.043
That's sweet.

05:10.043 --> 05:13.080
I mean, you don't hear
that often these days.

05:14.915 --> 05:17.551
Yeah. I was in
a long relationship,

05:17.551 --> 05:19.653
and when we broke up,

05:19.653 --> 05:23.056
my mom, she was having health
issues, so I moved in with her.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.758
How is she doing now?

05:24.758 --> 05:26.159
Good.

05:26.159 --> 05:29.296
So good, she's selling her house
and moving to Paris.

05:29.296 --> 05:31.365
Paris?

05:31.365 --> 05:32.533
That's pretty
impressive.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.568
(cell phone chimes)

05:34.568 --> 05:35.969
(Velcro peels apart)

05:38.005 --> 05:39.907
Tsk.

05:39.907 --> 05:40.774
Uh...

05:40.774 --> 05:42.776
I'm sorry, but I have to leave.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.311
I'm needed back
at the office.

05:44.311 --> 05:46.880
Well, we haven't even
had dessert yet.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.783
Mm... I don't have
much of a sweet tooth.

05:51.419 --> 05:53.421
Lydia.

05:53.421 --> 05:55.155
Can I call you again?

05:55.155 --> 05:58.325
Oh. Yeah. Give me a call.

05:58.325 --> 06:00.093
Okay. All right.

06:02.095 --> 06:04.598
Writing can be overwhelming.

06:04.598 --> 06:07.701
Okay? So I want you
to fight like hell

06:07.701 --> 06:10.671
the urge to tell people
what you're working on.

06:10.671 --> 06:13.741
'Cause I-I promise you,
even the people closest to you--

06:13.741 --> 06:16.710
your-your boyfriend,
your-your husband,

06:16.710 --> 06:17.878
your-your mother--

06:17.878 --> 06:19.713
they are going to say things

06:19.713 --> 06:21.114
to deflate you
and dissipate your energy.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.751
You need to have faith
in yourselves...

06:23.751 --> 06:24.718
(cell phone buzzing)

06:24.718 --> 06:28.221
...faith in your voice...

06:28.221 --> 06:30.791
and faith in your ability.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.793
Any questions so far?

06:32.793 --> 06:35.496
Sure, yeah. I know her face.
She works Highland.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.965
SAMMY:
She was stripped clean and
dumped in South Central.

06:37.965 --> 06:39.399
No clothes, no ID.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.469
I think her street
name is Cherry.

06:41.469 --> 06:43.704
Yeah, I've seen
her around.

06:43.704 --> 06:47.407
Well, we'll show
these around

06:47.407 --> 06:49.543
and see what we
can come up with.
All right.

06:53.781 --> 06:56.249
Russell, I've been trying
to reach you for over an hour.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.417
I was busy.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.586
Answer the damn phone, Russell.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.521
You know we're on call.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.856
Sounds like your date
didn't go so well.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.091
Meet me at the coroner's office.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.594
Gangs needs our help
on a homicide.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.907
Here she is.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.984
She must have fought like hell.

07:37.424 --> 07:39.560
(door opening)

07:40.427 --> 07:41.428
(door closes)

07:41.428 --> 07:43.430
Hi. I'm Detective Adams.

07:43.430 --> 07:44.965
I need to identify
a murder victim.

07:44.965 --> 07:48.201
She was dumped in an alley
with no ID and no clothes.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.737
Take a number.

07:49.737 --> 07:51.872
Won't take long. I just
need you to get the prints,

07:51.872 --> 07:53.240
so we can get the ball rolling.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.542
Prints are done
at the scene.

07:54.542 --> 07:55.843
But the machine was
out of commission.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.110
Why is that my problem?

07:57.110 --> 07:59.680
Can't you just do us
this favor, please?

07:59.680 --> 08:01.448
I make one exception,

08:01.448 --> 08:03.083
and the floodgates open.

08:03.083 --> 08:06.687
I'm sorry. I've been burned
too many times before.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.155
Yeah, but this
isn't about you.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.023
This is about giving
a poor girl a name.

08:10.023 --> 08:12.793
She was dumped in the
alley like a bag of trash.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.494
She deserves better than that.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.732
So, what do you think?
Should we reinterview

08:18.732 --> 08:20.734
the old lady that saw
the body in the alley?

08:20.734 --> 08:23.036
SAMMY:
No. It looks like Kenny
covered all the bases.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.472
Got a pretty good
description of the kids.

08:25.472 --> 08:27.741
NATE:
Kenny's been on the ball lately,
hasn't he?

08:27.741 --> 08:29.743
SAMMY:
I'm going to check
with Juvee.

08:29.743 --> 08:31.579
Let them run it
through their database.

08:31.579 --> 08:32.880
Yo. Miller time.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.015
Okay.
Oh. Who's up next?

08:35.015 --> 08:36.483
Not me. I got
the last report.

08:36.483 --> 08:38.251
I'm primary, so
I get a pass.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.559
(sighs)

08:45.559 --> 08:47.194
Mrs. Miller.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.097
NATE:
How are you today?

08:50.097 --> 08:51.965
Fine.
Good.
Please have a seat.

08:51.965 --> 08:52.933
Thank you.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.769
NATE: So, uh,
(clears throat)

08:55.769 --> 08:57.504
what can I do for you?

08:57.504 --> 09:00.307
I'm here
to make a police report.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.075
My daughter is missing.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.077
NATE:
And what's your
daughter's name?

09:04.077 --> 09:06.614
Princess.

09:06.614 --> 09:08.749
Her age?

09:08.749 --> 09:11.051
Just turned 19.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.052
She's my baby.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.486
My only girl.

09:13.486 --> 09:17.057
When was the last time you saw
your daughter, Mrs. Miller?

09:17.057 --> 09:20.594
January 7, 1992.

09:20.594 --> 09:23.430
ANDY:
Guys, come here and take
a look at these idiots.

09:23.430 --> 09:24.632
Come.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.201
Can you hold on
one second, please?

09:28.201 --> 09:30.704
So, I was checking
Facebook, MySpace, right?

09:30.704 --> 09:32.706
Bingo. YouTube.

09:32.706 --> 09:35.375
Geez.

09:35.375 --> 09:38.045
SAMMY:
We know those kids--
they hang with Grape Street.

09:38.045 --> 09:40.547
These little mutts have the
balls to put this on the Web.

09:40.547 --> 09:42.850
Bragging rights.

09:44.551 --> 09:46.086
Can you pause that?
Yeah.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.758
Look at that.

09:50.758 --> 09:53.360
Bastards couldn't
even leave

09:53.360 --> 09:54.628
the freakin' cross
on her neck.

09:54.628 --> 09:56.063
Had to take that, too.

09:56.063 --> 09:59.800
SAMMY:
Let's go pay those
baby bangers a visit.

10:05.238 --> 10:06.406
I got my own ho's.

10:06.406 --> 10:07.875
(chuckles):
"Ho's"?

10:07.875 --> 10:09.509
He's got ho's.

10:09.509 --> 10:11.311
You're just out of diapers, kid.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.981
Sorry, my man,
I got witnesses
that put you there,

10:13.981 --> 10:15.883
say you were all
over her ass.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.951
No way. I do
some crazy stuff,

10:17.951 --> 10:19.152
but I ain't no animal.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.788
Well, unless you
start talking,

10:20.788 --> 10:22.489
you're going away for murder.

10:22.489 --> 10:25.859
(chuckles):
Yeah, right, you
don't got nothing on me.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.561
Where'd you get the cross?

10:28.561 --> 10:30.363
My momz.

10:31.564 --> 10:34.001
Call your momz,

10:34.001 --> 10:35.736
tell her to start praying.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.343
Richter! How
you doing, boy?

10:43.343 --> 10:45.178
He's doing good.
Yeah?

10:45.178 --> 10:46.246
Richter, sit.

10:46.246 --> 10:47.280
Good.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.315
Speak.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.149
(barking)

10:49.149 --> 10:50.383
(laughs):
Lie down.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.585
Lie down.

10:52.585 --> 10:53.754
It's okay.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.423
(chuckles):
Good boy.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.859
Good. Play dead.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.161
(whines)
(chuckles)

11:01.161 --> 11:03.396
Reminds me of my
ex-wife in bed.

11:03.396 --> 11:04.431
SAMMY:
Tammi.

11:04.431 --> 11:07.000
Sammy! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.202
A woman wants
to hire Richter

11:09.202 --> 11:13.741
to search her son's
room for drugs, and
she's gonna pay me $200!

11:13.741 --> 11:15.275
Can you believe it?
200 bucks?

11:15.275 --> 11:17.177
I'm gonna pass out flyers
around the neighborhood,

11:17.177 --> 11:19.512
maybe even advertise
on the Web.
Absolutely not!

11:19.512 --> 11:20.748
Absolutely not!

11:20.748 --> 11:22.415
Why not?

11:22.415 --> 11:25.452
What... I was gonna
put the money toward
the Hasselblad.

11:25.452 --> 11:28.288
I am working.

11:30.557 --> 11:32.092
Come on.

11:39.266 --> 11:41.368
Any lead on
our girl yet?

11:41.368 --> 11:44.237
Showed her picture on the street
but came up empty.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.973
Thought Gangs
caught the case.

11:45.973 --> 11:48.575
Yeah, but it looks like
it's not gang-related.

11:48.575 --> 11:50.477
Good luck.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.179
We're gonna need it.

11:52.179 --> 11:54.447
Thanks.
All right.

11:54.447 --> 11:55.883
That's pretty much it.

11:55.883 --> 11:58.218
We're just gonna have
to wait for the prints.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.653
Well, you can wait--
I'm working this case.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.289
Why are you so bitchy?

12:02.289 --> 12:05.325
A dead girl's body
is waiting to be buried,

12:05.325 --> 12:08.561
and everybody seems
to be passing the buck.

12:08.561 --> 12:12.499
Lydia, you cannot take
this so personally.

12:12.499 --> 12:16.336
When's the last time
you had some fun, huh?

12:16.336 --> 12:18.806
Hold up, you ain't
sticking shit on me.

12:18.806 --> 12:20.774
Sit down! Sit... down.

12:20.774 --> 12:22.475
I'm tired of it.

12:22.475 --> 12:23.743
Shit-tired of it, okay?

12:23.743 --> 12:25.078
You got the dead girl's

12:25.078 --> 12:28.248
cross around your neck,
you've got your face

12:28.248 --> 12:29.549
plastered all over the Internet.

12:29.549 --> 12:30.750
You're going in,

12:30.750 --> 12:32.185
case closed--
process him, Nate.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.720
Easy, easy, you don't
got to do me like...

12:33.720 --> 12:36.623
I'm doing you the same way
that you did the girl!

12:36.623 --> 12:38.291
Hold up! It ain't
even like that!

12:38.291 --> 12:42.395
Just having some fun
throwing a few rocks and stuff.

12:42.395 --> 12:43.430
That's fun to you?

12:43.430 --> 12:46.366
Huh? Take the cross
off your neck.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.468
Take the cross
off your neck...

12:48.468 --> 12:49.436
I got this!

12:49.436 --> 12:51.338
Take the cross off!

12:51.338 --> 12:52.539
Look,

12:52.539 --> 12:53.573
all right?

12:53.573 --> 12:54.975
I took the cross!

12:54.975 --> 12:57.377
But I swear to you, man,
I didn't kill her.

12:57.377 --> 13:00.280
Some old white dude was driving
around-- he dumped her there.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.781
What kind of car
was he driving?

13:01.781 --> 13:02.950
Old white dude van--
you know,

13:02.950 --> 13:04.017
with the curtains
in the windows.

13:04.017 --> 13:07.554
He circled the block
a few times.

13:07.554 --> 13:08.856
Where are we headed?

13:08.856 --> 13:10.357
The women's shelter
in Hollywood.

13:10.357 --> 13:13.460
Most of the girls make
a pit stop there along the way.

13:13.460 --> 13:16.229
I was thinking maybe
we could show her picture around

13:16.229 --> 13:17.998
and see what we come up with.

13:17.998 --> 13:20.433
Okay. Cool.

13:23.603 --> 13:27.574
I know, Pop, but you and Mom
can't handle this on your own.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.442
I need to know these things.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.378
You have an address?

13:31.378 --> 13:33.981
All right,
I'll see you in a minute.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.315
What's up?

13:35.315 --> 13:37.184
My sister Mercedes
still isn't home.

13:37.184 --> 13:39.652
I need to take
a ride over there,

13:39.652 --> 13:41.588
calm my folks down.

13:47.160 --> 13:50.597
I got lucky--
one of the regulars knew her.

13:50.597 --> 13:53.233
Her name is Nicole Nelson.

13:53.233 --> 13:57.437
Let's go back to the office
and do a record check.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.912
No, no, you were great.

14:04.912 --> 14:07.214
Yeah, no, I'm gonna work
on my story right...

14:07.214 --> 14:09.917
Yeah, the one
I told you about.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.218
Okay, I got to go.

14:11.218 --> 14:13.286
I'm working on
Sally in the Alley.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.955
That homicide
in South Central.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.656
Okay, bye.
Wrap that up.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.258
There's been a shooting
on Hollywood and Highland.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.759
Everyone goes.
Code 2. Right now.

14:19.759 --> 14:21.461
Well, we're working on
this homicide, though.

14:21.461 --> 14:24.364
It can wait.
Yeah, but we just
I.D.'d the victim.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.966
We were on our way
to make the notification.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.267
You know what,
Detective?

14:27.267 --> 14:29.469
She'll still be dead
in five hours.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.373
(wry chuckle)
(chuckles)

14:37.677 --> 14:39.612
(siren wailing)

14:44.584 --> 14:46.519
MAN:
Step back.

14:49.622 --> 14:52.459
(helicopter blades whirring)

15:03.570 --> 15:05.605
Oh! What is this,

15:05.605 --> 15:08.275
the, uh, policeman's ball?
Hey, guys.
How you doing?

15:08.275 --> 15:09.476
(laughs):
How you doing, man?

15:09.476 --> 15:12.045
All right, we'll see
you in a second.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.280
This is kooky, nuts.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.482
(chuckles):
This is ridiculous.

15:16.849 --> 15:18.485
ANTONIO:
You believe this shit?

15:18.485 --> 15:20.753
There's more cops
out here than

15:20.753 --> 15:22.355
the North Hollywood
shootout.

15:22.355 --> 15:25.592
Some meth head tries to rip off
Mr. Schmitt from Stuttgart.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.960
Mr. Schmitt says no,

15:26.960 --> 15:30.330
puts up a fight,
gets shot in the thigh.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.931
Nein.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.933
That's "no" in German.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.302
They could've had
two black-and-whites

15:35.302 --> 15:37.470
and two detectives
to handle this.

15:38.905 --> 15:40.873
Look at her--
I'll bet she's up there

15:40.873 --> 15:44.211
telling the mayor
that the last time
a tourist got shot

15:44.211 --> 15:47.314
was that Japanese lady in 1981.

15:47.314 --> 15:50.083
Yeah, that guy who
shot his wife downtown
on the bridge--

15:50.083 --> 15:51.118
they just arrested him.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.752
I mean, it only took 20 years.

15:52.752 --> 15:55.888
You know what they say, you,
uh, you can run all you want,

15:55.888 --> 15:57.157
but if you kill a tourist,

15:57.157 --> 15:59.059
you're going
to jail tired, you know?

15:59.059 --> 16:03.096
I got a case for you
for that homicide blog.
Where you been, woman?

16:03.096 --> 16:05.965
They shut us down two
months ago, said they
ran out of funds.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.268
The community's in an uproar--
they don't know what's going on,

16:08.268 --> 16:11.904
they don't know where
to commemorate their kid--
they want the blog up now.

16:11.904 --> 16:13.540
I guess more people
have computers now

16:13.540 --> 16:15.342
than read the papers,
though.
That's weird.

16:15.342 --> 16:17.377
The whole world got
itself wired up.

16:17.377 --> 16:20.480
Yeah, it's crazy.
Well, we got to canvass.
All right.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.016
See you, Tony.
Yeah, see you later.

16:23.016 --> 16:25.385
All right, who saw anything?

16:27.687 --> 16:32.125
Um, once I release him,
please do not enter the room,

16:32.125 --> 16:35.128
okay?
Okay.
Okay.

16:35.128 --> 16:37.797
Whatever, um, whatever he...

16:37.797 --> 16:42.102
whatever he finds,
I'll bring out to you, okay?

16:42.102 --> 16:43.270
All right, boy.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.538
Yeah, do your thing.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.241
(growling)

16:48.241 --> 16:50.043
Got something
in there? No?

16:50.043 --> 16:52.212
Oh. Oh. What do
you got in here?

16:52.212 --> 16:53.746
(growling)
MAN:
Oh, my gosh.

16:53.746 --> 16:54.814
TAMMI:
There? There?

16:54.814 --> 16:55.848
Sit!

16:55.848 --> 16:56.883
Sit! Richter!

16:56.883 --> 16:57.917
Okay, Richter, sit!

16:57.917 --> 16:58.951
Um,

16:58.951 --> 16:59.986
um...

16:59.986 --> 17:01.521
Richter!
Richter!

17:01.521 --> 17:02.289
Uh, release!

17:02.289 --> 17:04.457
Release, Richter! Sit!

17:04.457 --> 17:07.294
Richter!
Hey, um,
What the hell are you doing?

17:07.294 --> 17:09.229
William, could you just
wait outside for a second?

17:09.229 --> 17:11.098
We'll be... we'll
be through. Okay?

17:11.098 --> 17:12.399
No! Who the hell are you?

17:12.399 --> 17:15.135
(Richter growling,
woman screams)

17:16.436 --> 17:18.671
WOMAN:
Oh, my God,
he bit him!

17:18.671 --> 17:19.672
Oh, my God!

17:19.672 --> 17:21.108
fucking dog bit me!

17:21.108 --> 17:22.175
Bill, what
have you done?!

17:22.175 --> 17:24.043
BILL:
What have I done?

17:24.043 --> 17:26.079
I'm bleeding and I
have playoffs tomorrow.
All right, all right.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.915
I'm really sorry, but he's just
doing what he's trained to do.

17:28.915 --> 17:30.317
You shouldn't have done that.

17:30.317 --> 17:31.484
Look what he's doing
to my Air Jordans.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.220
I'll buy you
another pair.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.088
They're not the same;
they're special edition.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.662
Excuse me.

17:42.662 --> 17:46.299
Yeah. That's why he
was going so crazy.

17:47.200 --> 17:50.370
I will be disposing of this.

17:50.370 --> 17:52.305
So, what do you know
about this guy?

17:52.305 --> 17:54.040
His name is Edwin.

17:54.040 --> 17:58.778
I don't know where he lives,
but I have his phone number.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.613
How old is this kid?

18:02.482 --> 18:04.484
He's 18.

18:06.319 --> 18:09.222
Geez, Pop... she's 15 years old.

18:09.222 --> 18:10.957
What the hell were you thinking?

18:10.957 --> 18:12.592
Mercedes has a mind of her own.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.395
You were the same at her age.
Why didn't
you tell me?

18:15.395 --> 18:17.297
You have enough headaches
with work, the kids.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.166
Yeah, but, Pop,
I could've stepped in.

18:19.166 --> 18:22.602
I could've done something,
set her straight or something.

18:24.871 --> 18:26.206
Hey, Edwin.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.340
It's Mercedes' brother.

18:27.340 --> 18:30.343
Put my sister
on the phone.

18:30.343 --> 18:33.112
Well, where the
hell is she?

18:34.046 --> 18:36.349
¿Sabes que? Cuedate alli.

18:36.349 --> 18:37.350
Porque vengo por ti.

18:37.350 --> 18:38.751
Hey,
Geez!

18:38.751 --> 18:40.353
hey, hey, calm down.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.222
You were young
once, remember?

18:42.222 --> 18:43.656
(exhales)

18:43.656 --> 18:46.092
You still have
your connection at
the phone company?

18:46.092 --> 18:47.126
Sure.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.161
Can we call that in?

18:48.161 --> 18:49.262
Absolutely.

18:49.262 --> 18:50.497
Pay this chulo
a visit.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.065
Just be sure
and mention the fact...

18:53.065 --> 18:56.969
Are we done here or are we
waiting for the National Guard?

18:56.969 --> 18:58.305
(dogs barking in distance)

18:58.305 --> 19:02.041
They probably went
to get a bite to eat.

19:02.041 --> 19:04.177
She's in school, man.

19:04.177 --> 19:06.346
You think this asshole
thinks about that?

19:06.346 --> 19:08.648
(cell phone ringing)

19:08.648 --> 19:09.516
School tomorrow.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.318
She has
homework due.

19:11.318 --> 19:12.652
You all
right, baby?

19:12.652 --> 19:13.786
What happened?

19:15.655 --> 19:17.290
(sirens wailing in distance)

19:17.290 --> 19:18.991
What do you mean
he bit someone?

19:18.991 --> 19:19.992
Who?

19:19.992 --> 19:22.262
Who?!

19:22.262 --> 19:23.630
I told you not to do that.

19:23.630 --> 19:25.164
We are not insured for that.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.499
We could be sued now.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.536
Are you fucking
nuts, Tammi?

19:30.637 --> 19:32.572
Tammi?

19:38.645 --> 19:40.213
(sighs)

19:41.113 --> 19:43.250
(doorbell rings)

19:45.952 --> 19:47.420
Mrs. Nelson.

19:47.420 --> 19:50.223
I apologize for
having to call you earlier.

19:50.223 --> 19:52.259
We usually do this
in person,

19:52.259 --> 19:55.528
but we had
a situation.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.464
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

19:57.464 --> 20:00.600
But may we come in and talk
to you about your daughter?

20:12.144 --> 20:14.314
(crowd cheering over TV)

20:14.314 --> 20:15.882
He don't
know it yet.

20:31.298 --> 20:34.000
Is my mom dead?

20:34.000 --> 20:37.337
Uh, you mind if I
turn this off here?

20:42.074 --> 20:43.943
Yeah, she is.

20:45.845 --> 20:49.382
I'm really,
really sorry.

20:49.382 --> 20:50.650
She was a whore.

20:52.552 --> 20:55.388
She was your mom.

20:58.358 --> 21:01.428
Look... I know

21:01.428 --> 21:04.030
you're always gonna
remember this night,

21:04.030 --> 21:06.399
how awful it is.

21:06.399 --> 21:10.903
But... you can build
good memories, too.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.939
You know?

21:12.939 --> 21:14.073
You got to do that.

21:14.073 --> 21:16.075
You got to focus on that.

21:16.075 --> 21:18.978
Try to remember
the nice things about her.

21:21.047 --> 21:22.449
You know what I'm talking about?

21:26.919 --> 21:28.421
All right, listen,

21:28.421 --> 21:31.524
you ever want
to talk about this,

21:31.524 --> 21:33.426
whenever that is--

21:33.426 --> 21:36.629
two days from now,

21:36.629 --> 21:40.700
a week, couple
months...

21:42.769 --> 21:45.304
we can do that.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.440
All right?

21:49.308 --> 21:50.543
We can do that.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.448
Okay?

21:57.950 --> 21:59.285
Okay.

21:59.285 --> 22:02.422
Okay.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.426
(chuckles softly)

22:06.426 --> 22:07.960
Your sister has a boyfriend.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.328
What is the big deal?

22:09.328 --> 22:11.464
That's what
teenagers do, right?

22:17.303 --> 22:19.439
(sighs)

22:32.552 --> 22:34.821
I hate competing
with those things.

22:34.821 --> 22:37.089
Uh, we caught a homicide
earlier in South Central.

22:37.089 --> 22:39.426
We need to put a rush on
the fingernail scrapings

22:39.426 --> 22:40.593
and the rape kit.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.698
Who do I need to speak
with to expedite this?

22:45.698 --> 22:46.966
You're speaking to him.

22:46.966 --> 22:50.870
We got a backlog of
3,000 cases on file.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.505
We got to process
the ones closest

22:52.505 --> 22:54.474
to the statute
of limitations.

22:57.176 --> 23:01.080
These rape kits have been
sitting here for ten years.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.148
Sorry to say.

23:02.148 --> 23:03.583
Yeah, well, tell that
to the victim.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.051
Whoa, ease up, Lyd.

23:05.051 --> 23:07.754
Each one of these rape kits
represents a rapist

23:07.754 --> 23:09.388
who could still be out there.

23:09.388 --> 23:10.322
I hear you.

23:10.322 --> 23:11.458
I got two girls.

23:11.458 --> 23:13.626
But we're
shorthanded.

23:13.626 --> 23:16.763
We were promised funding
to outsource it.

23:16.763 --> 23:18.431
Never came through.

23:18.431 --> 23:20.567
This is so wrong.
(cell phone ringing)

23:24.336 --> 23:26.473
Yeah?

23:26.473 --> 23:28.174
Um, I'm sorry to leave.

23:28.174 --> 23:30.643
Uh, this just really isn't
a good time right now.

23:32.512 --> 23:34.514
Okay. Bye.

23:34.514 --> 23:35.515
Who was that?

23:35.515 --> 23:37.950
The guy I had brunch with.

23:37.950 --> 23:39.151
Yeah? Brunch?

23:39.151 --> 23:40.152
That's safe.

23:40.152 --> 23:42.254
So did he make the cut?

23:42.254 --> 23:43.756
You gonna
see him again?

23:43.756 --> 23:44.591
(laughs)

23:44.591 --> 23:45.825
Come on, Lyd.

23:45.825 --> 23:47.727
No one ever gets
a second chance with you.

23:47.727 --> 23:48.961
Sorry, Russell,
I'm just really

23:48.961 --> 23:50.763
not in the mood
to date right now.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.398
(sighs)
Well, what do you

23:52.398 --> 23:53.700
want me to do?

23:53.700 --> 23:56.536
Put on a little outfit,
go out, get drunk,

23:56.536 --> 23:58.337
stagger to my car,

23:58.337 --> 24:00.106
get raped and
end up here

24:00.106 --> 24:01.407
for ten years
waiting for somebody

24:01.407 --> 24:02.942
to do something about it?

24:02.942 --> 24:04.944
Jeez, Lyd.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.278
Take it easy.

24:06.278 --> 24:08.180
(sighs)

24:19.859 --> 24:21.828
I got it.

24:21.828 --> 24:22.929
Okay.

24:22.929 --> 24:24.864
I didn't know
you still had that.

24:24.864 --> 24:25.865
Uh, yeah.

24:25.865 --> 24:28.100
Your mom gave that
to you, right?

24:28.100 --> 24:29.869
My dad.

24:29.869 --> 24:31.270
When you
graduated college?

24:31.270 --> 24:33.139
Uh-huh.

24:33.139 --> 24:34.841
So what are you doing?

24:34.841 --> 24:37.309
Typing a letter
or something?

24:37.309 --> 24:40.279
No, I'm gonna write.

24:40.279 --> 24:42.114
You are
so competitive.

24:42.114 --> 24:43.916
Can we not do
this right now?

24:43.916 --> 24:46.085
But seriously, I write,
so now you have to write?

24:46.085 --> 24:47.620
Can't we just
both write?

24:47.620 --> 24:49.689
You and every
other cop.

24:49.689 --> 24:50.823
Everyone thinks
they're a writer.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.825
You know what, Dina?

24:52.825 --> 24:53.993
You're not exactly Dostoevsky,

24:53.993 --> 24:55.928
all right?

24:58.865 --> 25:00.700
You're screwing that
teacher, aren't you?

25:01.601 --> 25:03.202
No.

25:04.303 --> 25:05.938
Fuck you.

25:16.082 --> 25:17.049
(keys clink)

25:19.185 --> 25:22.555
ENID (calling out):
Lydia, I'm heating up
something for you.

25:22.555 --> 25:24.657
Thanks, Mom.

25:28.394 --> 25:29.996
(laughs)

25:29.996 --> 25:31.330
Got great taste.

25:31.330 --> 25:32.398
That's for sure.

25:32.398 --> 25:33.499
He didn't grow them, Mom.

25:33.499 --> 25:34.801
Well, they're special.

25:34.801 --> 25:37.403
He didn't just call
1-800-daisies.

25:37.403 --> 25:39.639
Fine, I'll marry him.

25:39.639 --> 25:41.941
I hope you brought home
an appetite

25:41.941 --> 25:44.611
and not just
that foul mood.

25:44.611 --> 25:45.845
I'm sorry.

25:45.845 --> 25:47.580
It's just, this
case at work.

25:47.580 --> 25:48.881
This girl
was murdered,

25:48.881 --> 25:50.917
and it's like nobody
gives a damn but me.

25:52.819 --> 25:54.921
I made veal
blanquette.

25:56.455 --> 25:57.690
Fancy.

25:57.690 --> 25:59.191
Well, you know,
I want to be able

25:59.191 --> 26:01.260
to cook for real Parisians,
hold my head up high.

26:33.459 --> 26:35.628
(car door alarm beeps)

26:35.628 --> 26:36.663
The hell were
you thinking?

26:36.663 --> 26:37.697
I'm sorry.

26:37.697 --> 26:38.731
I was just so excited

26:38.731 --> 26:40.199
about the money.

26:40.199 --> 26:41.968
I-I don't want you to
have to worry anymore.

26:41.968 --> 26:44.737
You can't start a business
without insurance.

26:44.737 --> 26:46.472
Especially with
a messed-up animal.

26:46.472 --> 26:48.875
He bit someone...
now we're liable.

26:48.875 --> 26:50.109
That's not
my fault!

26:50.109 --> 26:51.711
You never told me
about the insurance!

26:51.711 --> 26:53.713
I told you not to do it.

26:53.713 --> 26:54.747
Period!

26:54.747 --> 26:55.848
I'm at work, I'm in

26:55.848 --> 26:57.784
the middle of a case,
you show up,

26:57.784 --> 26:59.218
I have to stop what I'm doing--

26:59.218 --> 27:01.854
which is freakin' important,
by the way--

27:01.854 --> 27:03.956
and explain it to you?

27:03.956 --> 27:05.391
I'm sorry, Sammy!

27:05.391 --> 27:07.727
(sobbing):
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

27:09.595 --> 27:10.830
I'm sorry!

27:10.830 --> 27:13.365
What am I gonna do with you?

27:13.365 --> 27:14.767
Please, Sammy.

27:14.767 --> 27:16.268
(sniffles)

27:16.268 --> 27:17.569
I'm sorry.

27:17.569 --> 27:19.638
Please.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.173
Please.

27:29.682 --> 27:31.884
(moaning softly)

27:38.324 --> 27:39.892
Really, it's okay.

27:39.892 --> 27:42.895
When I didn't hear from you,
I figured something was up.

27:42.895 --> 27:44.096
It's Mercedes.

27:44.096 --> 27:47.366
She never came
home from school.

27:47.366 --> 27:50.502
I was driving around for
hours looking for her.

27:50.502 --> 27:54.640
She's been giving my parents
a hard time lately.

27:54.640 --> 27:56.943
Hanging out with
the wrong crowd.

27:56.943 --> 27:57.810
They don't deserve that.

27:57.810 --> 27:59.812
Oh, my God.

27:59.812 --> 28:02.148
Your poor parents.

28:02.148 --> 28:05.484
What I got to do is figure out
the best way to handle this.

28:05.484 --> 28:08.955
No, we have to
figure it out.

28:08.955 --> 28:11.090
You're not in this alone,
you know?

28:14.493 --> 28:16.095
I know.

28:16.095 --> 28:17.396
Well, we better do it fast,

28:17.396 --> 28:19.732
because you have
another daughter on the way.

28:26.705 --> 28:27.774
LYDIA:
Apologize for what?

28:27.774 --> 28:28.975
You left a high priority scene

28:28.975 --> 28:30.442
without being relieved
from duty,

28:30.442 --> 28:32.611
you were mocking
the investigation,
which was Code 2.

28:32.611 --> 28:34.246
Mocking it how?

28:34.246 --> 28:38.384
You told Cathleen you thought
the National Guard was arriving?

28:38.384 --> 28:41.453
I'm sorry. I was frustrated
to be pulled off a case.

28:41.453 --> 28:43.890
Why isn't anybody
doing anything about

28:43.890 --> 28:46.558
the backlog of DNA?

28:46.558 --> 28:47.960
3,000 cases?

28:47.960 --> 28:50.162
And not a single article
has been written?

28:50.162 --> 28:51.898
Lydia, we are not
discussing this now.

28:51.898 --> 28:55.301
I didn't know I was
part of the cleanup.

28:55.301 --> 28:56.335
Cleanup?

28:56.335 --> 28:59.438
Listen, I don't
spin anything.

28:59.438 --> 29:01.307
Everything gets reported.

29:01.307 --> 29:03.409
Yes, sometimes
it's a balancing act.

29:03.409 --> 29:04.376
There's...

29:05.644 --> 29:06.946
(clearing throat)

29:06.946 --> 29:09.015
What kind of case
were you pulled off of?

29:09.015 --> 29:13.419
Girl in South Central strangled
and dumped in an alley.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.521
Mm.
Nothing you'd be
concerned with.

29:15.521 --> 29:17.756
Okay, what is it exactly

29:17.756 --> 29:21.593
that you don't like
about me, huh?

29:21.593 --> 29:25.264
I don't like the fact that if
this girl was found in an alley

29:25.264 --> 29:27.333
in Brentwood,
this would be front page news.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.268
That's...
I don't like that
there's a backlog

29:29.268 --> 29:31.603
of rape DNA of
3,000 cases.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.572
I don't like the
skirts you wear.

29:33.572 --> 29:35.174
I don't like
your hairstyle.

29:35.174 --> 29:37.910
I don't like that every time
a man is within 15 feet of you,

29:37.910 --> 29:40.412
you push out your chest, and
your voice gets all kittenish.

29:40.412 --> 29:41.380
Enough!

29:44.483 --> 29:47.386
(scoffs)

29:47.386 --> 29:49.621
(clearing throat)

29:49.621 --> 29:52.258
Excuse me.

29:52.258 --> 29:54.393
Okay.

29:55.561 --> 29:56.528
(door slams)

29:59.531 --> 30:01.433
Can I go now?

30:01.433 --> 30:02.401
Go.

30:10.309 --> 30:12.378
OFFICER:
This is Detective Adams.

30:12.378 --> 30:14.346
MRS. MILLER:
Detective Adams.

30:14.346 --> 30:17.917
Detective Adams,
they said you had another one

30:17.917 --> 30:19.018
like my daughter.

30:19.018 --> 30:20.419
I'm sorry?

30:20.419 --> 30:23.589
Another dead girl like
my daughter Princess.

30:23.589 --> 30:25.357
When did you daughter die?

30:25.357 --> 30:28.394
January 7, 1992.

30:34.066 --> 30:36.502
Let-let me talk to you some more
about your daughter.

30:36.502 --> 30:39.972
She's just 19.

30:39.972 --> 30:42.108
My only girl.

30:42.108 --> 30:45.011
Have a seat inside here.

30:45.011 --> 30:46.612
You said her name
was Princess?

30:46.612 --> 30:49.281
Yes, ma'am.
Okay.

30:49.281 --> 30:51.350
Look, don't worry, Pop,
all right?

30:51.350 --> 30:53.219
I'm not going to do
anything crazy, I promise.

30:53.219 --> 30:55.287
Just give me
the address.

30:57.456 --> 30:58.490
Thanks.

30:58.490 --> 30:59.892
We got to go, man.

30:59.892 --> 31:00.960
Sorry.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.262
What? What?!

31:06.498 --> 31:08.100
(engine starts)

31:13.605 --> 31:15.307
What the hell is going on?

31:15.307 --> 31:17.143
Mercedes never
came home last night.

31:17.143 --> 31:19.678
My father got an address
from one of her friends.

31:19.678 --> 31:22.714
You've been dragging my ass
all over the place for two days.

31:22.714 --> 31:25.617
What the hell
is going on, Nate?

31:25.617 --> 31:28.654
Mercedes isn't my sister.

31:28.654 --> 31:30.990
She's my daughter.

31:32.959 --> 31:35.127
Right after I enlisted,

31:35.127 --> 31:37.263
I found out
my girlfriend was pregnant.

31:37.263 --> 31:40.032
We were all set
to put the kid
up for adoption,

31:40.032 --> 31:42.601
but my parents jumped
in the middle of things.

31:42.601 --> 31:44.603
They refused to let
their first grandchild

31:44.603 --> 31:46.272
be raised by a stranger.

31:46.272 --> 31:49.575
Does Mercedes know?

31:49.575 --> 31:51.177
No.

31:51.177 --> 31:53.312
I don't know, maybe.

31:53.312 --> 31:57.049
Maybe that's why
she's acting out like this.

31:57.049 --> 31:59.018
You okay?

31:59.018 --> 32:00.752
I guess now isn't
the best time

32:00.752 --> 32:03.189
to ask permission
to open a cold case.
(phone ringing)

32:03.189 --> 32:05.557
Detective Clarke.

32:05.557 --> 32:07.593
Yeah, what is it?

32:07.593 --> 32:09.295
Oh, wow.

32:09.295 --> 32:11.830
That's great news.
I wasn't expecting that.

32:11.830 --> 32:13.699
Go ahead.

32:13.699 --> 32:15.034
Uh-huh.

32:15.034 --> 32:16.068
Thanks a lot.

32:16.068 --> 32:17.503
Hey, Lydia, guess what?

32:17.503 --> 32:21.073
Your new friend down at the lab
just got a DNA hit

32:21.073 --> 32:22.174
off the fingernail scrapings.

32:22.174 --> 32:23.542
He did that for us?

32:23.542 --> 32:25.111
He did it for you.

32:25.111 --> 32:27.379
He said if his girls
ever needed a detective,

32:27.379 --> 32:28.614
he'd want you handling the case.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.649
Well, who's our guy?
Lester Brown.

32:30.649 --> 32:31.917
He's a registered
sex offender.

32:31.917 --> 32:33.419
I'll do a record check.

32:33.419 --> 32:35.854
And I'll check with
parole and get an address.

32:35.854 --> 32:38.490
And then we're going to
need an arrest warrant.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.367
(dog barking nearby)

32:49.901 --> 32:51.803
Where's Mercedes?
I don't know.

32:51.803 --> 32:52.904
You lying to me?
No, man.

32:52.904 --> 32:53.939
Is she here?

32:53.939 --> 32:55.341
No.
No?

32:55.341 --> 32:57.376
I'm going to find out
for myself, you got that?

32:57.376 --> 32:59.445
Hey, we're cops,
you idiot!
(bottle breaking)

32:59.445 --> 33:00.446
Stupid.

33:00.446 --> 33:02.114
Mercedes here?
No, man.

33:02.114 --> 33:03.715
You know her?
I haven't seen her.

33:03.715 --> 33:06.152
SAMMY:
I don't want any
problems out of you.

33:06.152 --> 33:07.186
(dog barking)

33:07.186 --> 33:09.521
(Latin hip-hop music playing)

33:11.123 --> 33:12.624
NATE:
Mercedes.

33:12.624 --> 33:14.426
¿Que estas haciendo?

33:14.426 --> 33:16.062
¿Quien es este?
Cuitate!
Dejame sola, mentiroso!

33:16.062 --> 33:18.297
Get in the car.
I'm taking you home.
Get away from me.

33:18.297 --> 33:20.199
Get in the car.
You think I
wouldn't find out?!

33:20.199 --> 33:22.468
Why you drinking, huh?
Why you drinking?
You think I'm stupid?!

33:22.468 --> 33:23.369
Get in the car!

33:23.369 --> 33:24.636
Don't you run away from me!

33:24.636 --> 33:27.139
Get your hands off me,
you fuck!

33:27.139 --> 33:28.307
He's trying to mess with me!
Kick his ass!

33:28.307 --> 33:29.475
Get the fuck back!

33:29.475 --> 33:31.077
Get her out of here, Moretta.

33:31.077 --> 33:32.378
Back off!

33:32.378 --> 33:33.979
(Mercedes yelling)
Mercedes, calm down.

33:33.979 --> 33:35.681
Back off!

33:35.681 --> 33:38.550
All of you,
back the fuck off!

33:39.385 --> 33:41.720
MERCEDES:
You lied to me

33:41.720 --> 33:43.755
about everything
my whole life!
I'm sorry about that.

33:43.755 --> 33:45.857
I hate... Don't touch me!
Don't you fucking touch me!

33:45.857 --> 33:48.294
Just get in the car, please.
I trusted you
with everything!

33:48.294 --> 33:50.329
I trusted you
with everything!

33:50.329 --> 33:53.532
What are you doing hanging
out with these people?
You lied to me my whole life!

33:53.532 --> 33:55.501
I'm sorry about that.
My whole life!

33:55.501 --> 33:58.137
I'm sorry about that.
How do you expect me
to feel about that?!

33:58.137 --> 33:59.771
I'm here because
I love you, okay?

33:59.771 --> 34:02.341
MERCEDES:
Why are you doing this?
You know what?

34:02.341 --> 34:03.942
Get in the car.
No.

34:03.942 --> 34:06.044
Get in the car. We'll
talk about this later.
No.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.713
We're going to talk
about this later.
Get in the car.
No.

34:21.827 --> 34:23.795
(guns cocking)

34:44.250 --> 34:46.218
(garbled radio transmission)

34:52.958 --> 34:54.326
Lester Brown.

34:55.394 --> 34:57.363
He's on the move!

34:57.363 --> 34:59.165
Hands up!
Stay right there!

34:59.165 --> 35:02.168
Hold it!

35:02.168 --> 35:04.303
The dog!
Get him.

35:04.303 --> 35:05.637
(barking)

35:05.637 --> 35:07.473
(snarling)

35:15.781 --> 35:17.549
Heel, heel!

35:19.885 --> 35:22.554
Put your arms
out to the side.

35:22.554 --> 35:24.856
(grunting)

35:24.856 --> 35:27.359
Give me your left arm.

35:27.359 --> 35:30.296
(Brown snarling)

35:30.296 --> 35:31.797
Roll over on your right.
(dog barking)

35:31.797 --> 35:33.832
Sit up.

35:33.832 --> 35:36.067
Lester Brown,

35:36.067 --> 35:38.204
you're under arrest
for murder.

35:38.204 --> 35:40.406
(siren wailing)

35:46.812 --> 35:49.181
Someone saw a white van
pick Princess up.

35:49.181 --> 35:51.183
He could have
buried her out there.

35:51.183 --> 35:52.984
So he's a serial killer?

35:52.984 --> 35:54.286
Maybe. Could be.

35:54.286 --> 35:55.554
Maybe? Could be?

35:55.554 --> 35:58.490
Look, white van,
20 years ago.

35:58.490 --> 36:01.193
Both victims prostitutes
in Hollywood.

36:01.193 --> 36:03.128
That's all you got?

36:03.128 --> 36:05.096
Look, man, we're
working the case.

36:05.096 --> 36:06.432
What do you
want me to do?

36:06.432 --> 36:07.766
Write about it.

36:07.766 --> 36:10.269
Two victims, 20 years
apart, white van.

36:10.269 --> 36:11.470
Nothing's changed.

36:11.470 --> 36:13.239
You know what
this guy told me?

36:13.239 --> 36:14.773
He said he dumped her
in South Central

36:14.773 --> 36:16.475
because he thought
nobody would notice.

36:21.347 --> 36:23.415
You know, it's not
a bad idea.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.116
Nobody cared then,
nobody cares now,
yadda-yadda.

36:25.116 --> 36:26.318
Exactly.

36:26.318 --> 36:28.954
I could get the
case reopened.

36:28.954 --> 36:30.256
I'll think about it.

36:30.256 --> 36:32.358
Well, it would help.

36:32.358 --> 36:35.961
Hmm, and we got to do something
about that backlog of rape DNA.

36:35.961 --> 36:37.128
I'm working on it.

36:37.128 --> 36:38.264
Well, what's
taking so long?

36:38.264 --> 36:39.631
It's kind of a
big story, Lyd.

36:39.631 --> 36:41.900
It's going to make a lot
of people look bad.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.735
Too bad.

36:43.735 --> 36:44.936
I'm working on it.

36:44.936 --> 36:46.872
Work faster.
(chuckles)

36:53.412 --> 36:55.947
Come on, I'll
give you a ride.

36:55.947 --> 36:57.716
I need to talk to you.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.885
Well, I don't want
to talk to you.

37:02.688 --> 37:07.959
I needed my birth certificate
to get a learner's permit.

37:07.959 --> 37:10.762
But every time I would ask Pops,
he would change the subject.

37:15.334 --> 37:18.136
I didn't want you to
find out this way.

37:18.136 --> 37:19.938
When?

37:19.938 --> 37:21.740
On your death bed?

37:26.077 --> 37:29.715
Look, I was young.

37:29.715 --> 37:33.385
I couldn't give you the
home that you deserved.

37:33.385 --> 37:34.753
Mom and Pops, they
could give that to you.

37:34.753 --> 37:38.390
What about my mother?
Why didn't she take me?

37:39.758 --> 37:43.862
Because your mother fell
into the wrong group of people.

37:45.196 --> 37:48.734
Okay? She got into drugs.
She got into alcohol.

37:50.902 --> 37:52.904
Do you still talk to her?

37:52.904 --> 37:54.039
No, mija, I don't.

37:58.209 --> 38:01.380
By the time I came home
from the army, she...

38:01.380 --> 38:03.449
she moved away.

38:05.517 --> 38:07.386
Do I look like her?

38:10.822 --> 38:13.191
Sure do.

38:13.191 --> 38:14.493
A lot.

38:16.562 --> 38:18.697
You're beautiful.

38:19.598 --> 38:21.533
Just the way she was.

38:21.533 --> 38:23.669
I want to find her.

38:26.905 --> 38:29.107
Okay.

38:29.107 --> 38:30.742
We can try.

38:30.742 --> 38:32.678
For real?

38:34.480 --> 38:36.815
For real.

38:36.815 --> 38:40.419
This is the best
camera in the world.

38:40.419 --> 38:42.153
The world?

38:42.153 --> 38:44.089
Cartier-Bresson thought so.

38:46.792 --> 38:49.260
All right.

38:49.260 --> 38:50.596
Put $500 on this one,

38:50.596 --> 38:54.533
$600 on that one,

38:54.533 --> 38:56.435
the rest on that one.

38:58.604 --> 39:01.740
You know what?
Switch the last two.

39:03.308 --> 39:04.643
In the world?

39:04.643 --> 39:06.912
(cash register beeping)

39:28.600 --> 39:30.736
(engine shutting off)

39:49.755 --> 39:51.590
Good morning,
Mrs. Miller.

39:51.590 --> 39:54.626
Oh, are you here
about my Princess?

39:54.626 --> 39:57.996
Yeah. I thought
you might like to see this.

39:57.996 --> 40:00.899
My eyes don't see
so good anymore.

40:00.899 --> 40:01.667
Come on in.

40:01.667 --> 40:03.802
Let me get my glasses.

40:13.545 --> 40:14.746
It's about your daughter.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.848
What happened to her.

40:18.917 --> 40:21.419
I might be able to
get the case reopened,

40:21.419 --> 40:23.722
and this publicity
might help.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.765
(sobbing)

40:42.808 --> 40:45.877
Why'd you do that for us?

40:48.179 --> 40:50.115
My only girl.

40:53.685 --> 40:57.689
I think that, uh, she would
have wanted you to have that.

41:06.732 --> 41:09.034
My grammy said
you caught the guy.

41:09.034 --> 41:11.269
Yeah, we did.

41:11.269 --> 41:13.438
That's good, right?

41:13.438 --> 41:15.707
Definitely.

41:20.812 --> 41:22.781
See, I was surprised
to get your call.

41:22.781 --> 41:26.284
I had just about
given up on you.

41:26.284 --> 41:27.719
I'm sorry.

41:27.719 --> 41:30.221
I really wanted to make
up for that last time.

41:32.057 --> 41:34.726
Don't worry about it.

41:34.726 --> 41:36.494
I'll tell you, though.

41:36.494 --> 41:37.963
It's a great choice.

41:37.963 --> 41:40.532
Yeah, it's my mother's
recommendation.

41:40.532 --> 41:43.334
Did she move to...
Paris yet?

41:43.334 --> 41:45.270
Mm. Soon.

41:46.672 --> 41:48.574
I have something to tell you.

41:48.574 --> 41:50.709
I'm a cop.

41:52.578 --> 41:54.713
Geez.

41:55.747 --> 41:57.683
I didn't see that one coming.

42:00.986 --> 42:02.821
Cop.

42:03.655 --> 42:07.626
So, you... you enjoy your job?

42:08.493 --> 42:10.696
I love it.

42:14.833 --> 42:16.968
I really love it.

42:20.839 --> 42:22.974
And I had a good week.

42:23.942 --> 42:25.243
Hmm.
