Come on, Sof, go faster.
I can catch 'em.

01:04.899 --> 01:07.299
Okay, James,
get ready.

01:11.704 --> 01:13.705
Maybe you should
just catch them the normal way.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.340
I want to make sure
we have enough

01:15.342 --> 01:16.942
for all the kids
in the village.

01:16.944 --> 01:20.746
Whoa, look at that.
Cedric's got a new contraption.

01:20.748 --> 01:23.048
Cedric, can we ride
in your flying machine?

01:23.050 --> 01:25.784
Yes, can we,
Mr. Cedric? Please?

01:25.786 --> 01:27.586
I'm so sorry, children,

01:27.588 --> 01:30.189
but this is
my most prized possession.

01:30.191 --> 01:32.958
So the answer is
a big, whopping no.

01:39.065 --> 01:42.935
A successful trip
to the charmacy, Wormy.

01:42.937 --> 01:45.771
Behold the extremely rare

01:45.773 --> 01:48.340
petal of the alabaster
rose.

01:48.342 --> 01:52.111
This ivory beauty only blooms
every 100 years,

01:52.113 --> 01:54.713
but now that
it's blossomed,

01:54.715 --> 01:58.617
I have everything I need
for my power plucking potion.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.752
Oh, at long last,

02:00.754 --> 02:02.788
I shall be able
to use this potion

02:02.790 --> 02:04.723
to make the amulet
of Avalor

02:04.725 --> 02:07.226
give me any power
I want.

02:07.228 --> 02:11.330
Let's just keep you
nice and safe in here, shall we?

02:11.332 --> 02:14.333
Now, all I have to do
is get Sofia's amulet

02:14.335 --> 02:17.903
by switching it
with this fake one I made.

02:17.905 --> 02:19.938
Then I shall have
plenty of time

02:19.940 --> 02:22.007
to use the potion
on the real amulet

02:22.009 --> 02:24.676
and give myself
a power so great,

02:24.678 --> 02:29.648
I'll finally be able
to take over the kingdom!

02:29.650 --> 02:31.183
Come along, Wormy.

02:31.185 --> 02:34.686
Let us find
the princess.

02:34.688 --> 02:36.655
Just a few more, okay?

02:38.158 --> 02:40.692
Wormy, go and distract them.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.962
Hey!

02:43.964 --> 02:45.230
Wormwood!

02:45.232 --> 02:48.767
Switcherwitchitus switcheroo!

02:51.137 --> 02:54.139
I-I-I... I can't believe it.

02:54.141 --> 02:56.775
After all these years,

02:56.777 --> 03:00.145
the amulet of Avalor
is mine.

03:03.783 --> 03:06.685
Mummy, the day I have
been waiting for

03:06.687 --> 03:09.188
has finally come.

03:09.190 --> 03:11.223
You stole the amulet.

03:11.225 --> 03:14.026
Yes. And Sofia doesn't
even realize it's missing,

03:14.028 --> 03:15.994
so I'll have
plenty of time

03:15.996 --> 03:17.162
to extract one of
its powers

03:17.164 --> 03:19.831
with this power
plucking potion.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.301
But the amulet can
give you so many powers.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.369
The power to be invisible,

03:24.371 --> 03:27.072
to read minds, to grow
as tall as a giant.

03:27.074 --> 03:29.474
Which one will you choose?

03:29.476 --> 03:33.478
I want the power
of supreme strength.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.747
Then I shall be
the mightiest in the land,

03:35.749 --> 03:37.482
and no one will be able
to stop me

03:37.484 --> 03:39.918
from taking over
the kingdom.

03:39.920 --> 03:44.022
Now let's get this
power-plucking party started.

03:44.024 --> 03:47.459
I simply dip the amulet
in the potion and...

03:49.395 --> 03:52.231
- What's wrong?
- My hands are stuck.

03:52.233 --> 03:53.799
Here. Let Mummy help.

03:55.835 --> 03:58.003
Oh, my potion.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.871
Oh, no! It's all gone!

03:59.873 --> 04:02.908
And I'm stuck again.

04:02.910 --> 04:06.044
Why are my hands
so sticky?

04:06.046 --> 04:08.814
Oh, you put
the amulet on?

04:08.816 --> 04:10.082
Well, of course I did.
Why?

04:10.084 --> 04:11.883
Once you put
the amulet on,

04:11.885 --> 04:14.319
you're bound
by its rules.

04:14.321 --> 04:17.222
"For each deed performed,
for better or worse,

04:17.224 --> 04:21.260
a power is granted,
a blessing or curse."

04:21.262 --> 04:23.362
The amulet cursed me.

04:23.364 --> 04:26.531
Yes, my dear,
with sticky fingers,

04:26.533 --> 04:29.935
for stealing
Princess Sofia's
amulet, no doubt.

04:29.937 --> 04:32.137
I must undo the curse.
But how?

04:32.139 --> 04:34.806
"The only way
to break the curse

04:34.808 --> 04:37.442
is to make up for
your bad deed"

04:37.444 --> 04:40.078
Well, since you took
something from Sofia,

04:40.080 --> 04:42.481
maybe you should give
something to her.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.983
But what?
Surely not the amulet.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.885
Of course not.

04:46.887 --> 04:49.488
You need that to take
over the kingdom.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.990
Give her something else.

04:51.992 --> 04:54.559
Something as important
to you as the amulet
is to her.

04:54.561 --> 04:56.395
What do I have

04:56.397 --> 04:59.197
that the princess
could possibly want?

05:01.834 --> 05:04.002
Let's go ask her,
shall we?

05:04.004 --> 05:06.872
Mummy, I do not
need a chaperone.

05:06.874 --> 05:09.007
Of course you do, Ceddy.

05:12.512 --> 05:14.446
Now let's hurry.

05:14.448 --> 05:17.115
It's only a matter of time
before Sofia realizes

05:17.117 --> 05:19.584
she's not wearing
the real amulet.

05:31.364 --> 05:32.964
There she is.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.199
( squawks )

05:34.201 --> 05:36.368
Oh, yes, we mustn't
let her see that.

05:42.108 --> 05:43.875
Hi, Mr. Cedric.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.043
Want an apple?

05:45.045 --> 05:47.112
No! No, no, thank you.

05:48.481 --> 05:50.916
You're too kind,
Princess Sofia.

05:50.918 --> 05:53.885
In fact, I'd like to do
something kind for you
in return.

05:53.887 --> 05:56.388
Is there anything
you want, anything
at all?

05:56.390 --> 05:58.357
Oh, that's nice of you.

05:58.359 --> 06:00.425
But I don't need anything.

06:00.427 --> 06:03.562
Oh, I'm not asking
what you need.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.597
I'm asking
what you want

06:05.599 --> 06:07.999
more than
anything in
the world, hm?

06:08.001 --> 06:10.469
Coming in for
a landing.

06:12.171 --> 06:14.606
I know. How about a ride
in your flying machine

06:14.608 --> 06:16.241
for both of us?

06:16.243 --> 06:19.044
Oh, absolutely not.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.079
It's the most precious
thing I own.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.515
Oh, that's okay.
I understand.

06:23.517 --> 06:26.885
But Ceddykins,
giving Sofia
that flying machine

06:26.887 --> 06:30.422
might help you get
rid of your sticky fingers.

06:30.424 --> 06:32.424
Right, Mummy.

06:32.426 --> 06:34.326
What I meant to say,
Princess Sofia,

06:34.328 --> 06:36.495
is that I can do
ever so much better

06:36.497 --> 06:39.364
than giving you
one measly ride
in the flying machine.

06:39.366 --> 06:41.233
I'll be right back.

06:47.039 --> 06:48.573
Oh, lovely.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.409
It's Furball
and the feather heads.

06:50.411 --> 06:53.245
Of course, if they try and
chitchat with the princess now,

06:53.247 --> 06:55.113
she'll figure out she doesn't
have the real amulet.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.082
Well, I've got to
keep them away.

06:59.085 --> 07:01.620
Why, hello there,
friends.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.622
Why, hello there,
bird breath.

07:03.624 --> 07:04.990
We're looking for Sofia.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.358
Whatever for,

07:06.360 --> 07:09.127
when we could have
so much fun ourselves.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.929
Fun? Did you just
say fun?

07:10.931 --> 07:12.397
You never have fun.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.266
Do you even know
what the word means?

07:14.268 --> 07:16.968
I am quite aware of
the definition of the word fun.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.137
I shall prove it.

07:19.139 --> 07:22.107
Oh, yes, see.
Look at me.

07:22.109 --> 07:25.277
Splishing and splashing
simultaneously.

07:25.279 --> 07:27.979
Come join me,
won't you?

07:27.981 --> 07:29.648
Ha ha, yeah.
That's cute.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.450
We're gonna go
find Sofia now.

07:31.452 --> 07:32.951
Have a nice bath.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.319
Wait!

07:34.321 --> 07:36.154
Uh...

07:36.156 --> 07:38.290
it's just that it gets
so lonely

07:38.292 --> 07:40.459
up in Cedric's workshop.

07:40.461 --> 07:43.161
No animal friends
to talk to.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.964
Oh, how I would love
a few friends

07:45.966 --> 07:48.133
to jump about with.

07:48.135 --> 07:51.336
Oh, we can keep you company,
Wormwood. Right, Clover?

07:51.338 --> 07:54.339
Ew. If you guys wanna
yuk it up with Cranky bird here,

07:54.341 --> 07:56.141
you go right ahead.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.510
Me, I'm gonna go see
what Sofia's up to.

07:58.512 --> 08:01.279
Oh, well, then I suppose
I shall have to show

08:01.281 --> 08:03.048
Robin and Mia
how to get into

08:03.050 --> 08:05.383
the castle's food pantry
without you.

08:05.385 --> 08:08.753
Whoa, whoa.
You can get us
into the food pantry?

08:08.755 --> 08:11.223
Who's fun now,
Furball?

08:11.225 --> 08:14.326
There. Whew!
That's the last one.

08:14.328 --> 08:16.595
- Let's get going.
- Princess Sofia!

08:24.504 --> 08:28.406
I would like to give
my flying machine to you.

08:28.408 --> 08:30.108
Give it to me?

08:30.110 --> 08:32.010
That's really nice
of you, Mr. Cedric,

08:32.012 --> 08:34.179
but I couldn't
possibly accept it.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.413
Of course you can.

08:35.415 --> 08:37.048
But it's your most
prized possession.

08:37.050 --> 08:40.051
Which is why I want
to give it to you,

08:40.053 --> 08:42.053
because sometimes,
we must part with

08:42.055 --> 08:44.022
the things we cherish most.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.224
Here. Take it.
I insist.

08:46.226 --> 08:49.160
Okay. If you're sure.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.495
Thank you, Mr. Cedric.

08:50.497 --> 08:52.163
No, not a hug. Oh.

08:52.165 --> 08:54.799
- No.
- What is it?

08:54.801 --> 08:57.302
( gasps )
My hands.

08:57.304 --> 08:58.570
What about them?

08:58.572 --> 09:00.405
It doesn't matter.

09:00.407 --> 09:02.374
Go enjoy your new
flying machine.

09:02.376 --> 09:04.109
Can we go for a ride
in it, Sof?

09:04.111 --> 09:05.610
But the apples,
remember?

09:05.612 --> 09:07.145
It'll just
take a minute.

09:07.147 --> 09:10.448
- Okay, but just
a quick one.
- Brilliant!

09:12.585 --> 09:16.187
Prepare for takeoff.

09:16.189 --> 09:17.822
Liftoff!

09:22.261 --> 09:23.695
You were right, Mummy.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.530
The good deed
broke the curse.

09:25.532 --> 09:27.432
My hands are
sticky no more.

09:27.434 --> 09:29.267
Oh, that's wonderful.

09:29.269 --> 09:32.103
But how can I get
a power from the amulet now?

09:32.105 --> 09:35.774
All my power-plucking
potion is gone.

09:35.776 --> 09:38.777
You'll have to get a power
the way Sofia gets them.

09:38.779 --> 09:41.613
By doing very,
very good deeds.

09:41.615 --> 09:44.316
I don't know the first
thing about being good.

09:44.318 --> 09:46.084
( laughing )

09:46.086 --> 09:47.786
Ah, but she does.

09:47.788 --> 09:50.121
Why, yes, the princess
is an expert

09:50.123 --> 09:52.791
at being a goody-goody.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.694
I'll get her to help me
do kind acts.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.462
Good thinking, Mummy.

10:01.167 --> 10:03.134
Mr. Cedric,
that was a-mazing,

10:03.136 --> 10:04.636
but I've got to go.

10:04.638 --> 10:06.571
I'm giving all these apples
to the villagers.

10:06.573 --> 10:07.872
Of course you are.

10:07.874 --> 10:09.574
Can I have
another ride?

10:09.576 --> 10:11.142
Liftoff again.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.777
Brilliant!

10:12.779 --> 10:15.580
Princess Sofia,
would you mind

10:15.582 --> 10:17.315
if I accompany you?

10:17.317 --> 10:18.883
Oh, I'd love that.

10:18.885 --> 10:20.752
You can help me
hand out the apples.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.287
Oh, how wonderful.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.889
Let us do some good.

10:28.194 --> 10:30.295
Come on, Mia,
bring me home.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.897
Oh, no, you're not gonna
score on me and my boy,

10:32.899 --> 10:34.733
right, Wormwood?

10:34.735 --> 10:36.735
Righto. Go, team, go.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.436
Whoop. There you have it.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.606
Yes!

10:41.608 --> 10:44.275
Catch it, Wormwood.

10:52.184 --> 10:54.219
Yeah! Out!

10:54.221 --> 10:55.654
We win!

10:55.656 --> 10:57.489
We win?

10:57.491 --> 10:59.658
We win?!
We win!

10:59.660 --> 11:02.594
Yeah. Nice play,
Wormy.

11:02.596 --> 11:04.295
We are the victors.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.197
Hooray for us.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.800
Boom-boom squawk,
boom-boom squawk.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.602
Good game, guys.

11:10.604 --> 11:12.637
Shall we go find
Sofia now?

11:12.639 --> 11:16.541
Or... we could play
a round of waffle hockey.

11:16.543 --> 11:18.276
I shall be the goalie.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.779
Apples. Who'd like
an apple?

11:20.781 --> 11:24.215
They're very sweet
and... uh, apple-y.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.284
( all exclaiming )

11:26.286 --> 11:27.952
Oh, you're so welcome.

11:33.325 --> 11:35.427
It isn't glowing,
Mummy.

11:35.429 --> 11:37.529
Giving away a few apples
is not a good enough deed

11:37.531 --> 11:39.330
to grant me a power.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.499
You've got to do
something bigger.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.201
Kinder.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.303
Nicer.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.307
How about this for nice?

11:49.309 --> 11:51.209
Super-size-o, orange tree.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.312
Become a fruity jubilee.

11:57.349 --> 12:00.251
Mom, that pear is huge!

12:00.253 --> 12:03.688
And look at the size
of that... watermelon?!

12:07.693 --> 12:10.261
Aye, fruit salad
for everyone.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.429
Wow, Mr. Cedric.

12:11.431 --> 12:14.265
That was really
nice of you.

12:18.604 --> 12:20.405
It's glowing.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.341
Does that mean I have
a power?

12:30.416 --> 12:31.783
I'm huge!

12:31.785 --> 12:34.285
Like the giant fruit
I conjured.

12:34.287 --> 12:37.956
Being this size
will make taking over
the kingdom a breeze!

12:37.958 --> 12:41.359
I can simply squash
anything in my way.

12:42.394 --> 12:43.661
Oh, no.
What happened?

12:43.663 --> 12:46.431
Oh, please,
make me big again.

12:48.434 --> 12:49.934
Are you kidding?

12:49.936 --> 12:52.370
You took away my power
just for squashing

12:52.372 --> 12:55.406
one teensy, tiny
little wagon?

12:55.408 --> 12:58.276
Fixitus upitus.

12:59.578 --> 13:01.446
There. I fixed it.

13:01.448 --> 13:02.847
All better now.

13:02.849 --> 13:05.450
So make me big.
Big-ify me.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.452
( whimpering )

13:07.454 --> 13:09.988
The power is gone.

13:09.990 --> 13:14.793
Oh, Cedric, you have to stop
doing bad things,

13:14.795 --> 13:16.427
as hard as that may be,

13:16.429 --> 13:18.763
and do another
good deed, quick.

13:18.765 --> 13:19.497
Yes, Mummy.

13:23.335 --> 13:25.937
Mr. Cedric, everyone
loves your fruit tree.

13:25.939 --> 13:28.606
Yes, yes,
how very heartwarming.

13:28.608 --> 13:31.442
But Sofia, I need
you to help me

13:31.444 --> 13:33.478
do more nice things.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.613
- More?
- A lot more.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.782
I don't ever
want to stop.

13:37.784 --> 13:39.450
Oh, please.

13:39.452 --> 13:42.787

16:11.538 --> 16:14.105
Nothing can stop me from
taking over the kingdom now.

16:14.107 --> 16:16.841
( evil laughter )

16:16.843 --> 16:19.043
Wait, I didn't mean it.
I take it back.

16:20.546 --> 16:23.181
Oh, the power is gone
again.

16:23.183 --> 16:26.584
No matter how hard I try,
I just cannot be good.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.888
Oh, I better fix this
before Sofia sees.

16:36.195 --> 16:38.629
Oh, there you are,
Mr. Cedric.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.865
I guess we should
head back to the castle.

16:40.867 --> 16:42.633
Oh, so that's it then.

16:42.635 --> 16:45.503
Pack up the kindness coach
and go home.

16:45.505 --> 16:48.506
I'm surprised at you,
Princess Sofia.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.641
I guess you're right.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.643
There's always
a good deed to be
done somewhere.

16:52.645 --> 16:56.547
And this time, I won't
do anything unkind

16:56.549 --> 16:57.715
that will get me cursed.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.018
I will not,
I will not, I will not!

17:00.020 --> 17:01.953
Mr. Cedric,
come quick.

17:01.955 --> 17:04.522
There's someone having
a lot of trouble over here.

17:04.524 --> 17:05.623
Oh, marvelous.

17:06.592 --> 17:09.260
( straining )

17:09.262 --> 17:12.030
Well, in need of
some help, are we?

17:12.032 --> 17:14.632
I'm trying to build
this house for my family,

17:14.634 --> 17:17.101
but my cart broke,
and the stones are so heavy.

17:17.103 --> 17:19.904
Can you use your magic
to help lift the stones?

17:19.906 --> 17:22.740
Well, I could,
but I could also use my magic

17:22.742 --> 17:25.543
to build the entire house.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.879
The time has come
to end this chore.

17:27.881 --> 17:31.816
Build a house
from roof to floor!

17:36.055 --> 17:37.755
Great goblins!

17:37.757 --> 17:39.924
It would've taken
the strength of 100 men

17:39.926 --> 17:42.026
to build a house
this fast.

17:42.028 --> 17:43.895
I thank you, sir.

17:43.897 --> 17:45.730
Come look.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.599
Oh, it's glowing.

17:48.601 --> 17:49.700
Did you give me a power?

17:49.702 --> 17:51.035
Well, what is it?

17:51.037 --> 17:53.137
I don't feel
any different.

17:57.943 --> 18:03.581
Could it be the power
I've been longing for
all this time?

18:03.583 --> 18:05.683
Yes!

18:05.685 --> 18:07.752
I have the power
of supreme strength.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.687
Oh, how glorious!

18:09.689 --> 18:11.622
With strength like this,

18:11.624 --> 18:14.659
I can overcome anyone
who tries to stop me

18:14.661 --> 18:16.360
from taking
King Roland's throne.

18:16.362 --> 18:18.129
Come along, princess.

18:18.131 --> 18:20.765
It's time to return
to the castle.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.734
Get out, you scalawags.
Scoot, scoot.

18:31.810 --> 18:34.979
Clover, Robin, Mia!

18:37.082 --> 18:38.649
Oh, no!

18:38.651 --> 18:41.119
I haven't seen you guys
all day.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.854
( no audio )

18:42.856 --> 18:45.690
That's weird.
I can't understand you.

18:45.692 --> 18:47.692
No, no, no.
Don't talk to them.

18:47.694 --> 18:50.261
Wormy, what
are you doing?

18:50.263 --> 18:52.663
- ( squawking )
- Stop, Wormwood.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.832
I think something's
wrong with my amulet.

18:54.834 --> 18:57.635
I wish to be small.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.403
I can't shrink either.

18:59.405 --> 19:00.705
My amulet's not working.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.907
I better take it
to Mr. Cedric.

19:02.909 --> 19:06.410
Maybe he can tell me
what's wrong with it.

19:06.412 --> 19:09.247
That's what I get
for having fun.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.849
Hey, Wormwood,
where you goin'?

19:11.851 --> 19:14.352
None of your business,
feather head.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.420
I knew it was
too good to last.

19:16.422 --> 19:18.823
Oh, where is he?

19:21.260 --> 19:23.661
Ah, the king's throne.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.697
Or should I say,
my throne.

19:26.699 --> 19:29.367
What are you doing
with the king's throne?

19:29.369 --> 19:31.202
That does not concern you.

19:31.204 --> 19:33.404
Now go fetch
King Roland.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.373
I have some important
news for him.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.241
Go on.
Be quick about it.

19:42.714 --> 19:45.716
Oh, I can't wait
any longer.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.752
( sighs )

19:47.754 --> 19:51.856
I hereby declare myself
the new king of Enchancia.

19:51.858 --> 19:54.859
From now on, everyone
shall do whatever I say,

19:54.861 --> 19:57.228
or go straight
to the dungeon.

19:57.230 --> 19:59.830
I shall rule
with an iron fist.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.233
Oh, no.

20:11.843 --> 20:14.478
My fists have
turned to iron.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.380
Oh, the amulet
cursed me again.

20:16.382 --> 20:19.383
But why? For trying to
take over the kingdom?

20:19.385 --> 20:22.753
That's not a bad thing.
I deserve to be king.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.488
( sobbing )
I do.

20:24.490 --> 20:28.192
( cawing )

20:28.194 --> 20:29.927
Oh, Wormy,
this is terrible.

20:29.929 --> 20:32.997
No one will obey
a king who has
ridiculous metal hands.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.832
I must go to the workshop
and find a way

20:34.834 --> 20:36.500
to fix them
immediately.

20:36.502 --> 20:37.835
( cawing insistently )

20:37.837 --> 20:39.503
Oh, what's the use?

20:39.505 --> 20:41.839
He can't understand
a word I'm squawking.

20:41.841 --> 20:44.875
Oh, Mother,
come quick.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.877
What is it, dear?

20:46.879 --> 20:49.513
Look what the amulet did
to my hands.

20:49.515 --> 20:52.850
That is one
dreadful curse.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.885
You must help me
get rid of it.

20:54.887 --> 20:57.888
The only way to break
a curse this nasty

20:57.890 --> 20:59.890
is to do the most noble,
kind-hearted act

20:59.892 --> 21:01.759
you can think of.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.865
What could I ever do
that would be kind enough

21:07.867 --> 21:10.768
to break such
a wretched curse?

21:10.770 --> 21:12.470
SOFIA: Hello?

21:14.806 --> 21:16.073
What happened
to your door?

21:16.075 --> 21:17.775
And floor?

21:17.777 --> 21:19.310
It's a long story.

21:19.312 --> 21:21.479
Mr. Cedric,
I really need your help.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.080
Something's wrong
with my amulet.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.248
What makes you say that?

21:24.250 --> 21:27.285
It's just not doing
things it usually does.

21:27.287 --> 21:28.319
Do you think
you can fix it?

21:28.321 --> 21:30.421
Fixing your amulet

21:30.423 --> 21:32.923
is probably the most noble,

21:32.925 --> 21:36.794
kind-hearted thing
I could do, isn't it?

21:36.796 --> 21:38.963
It would sure mean
a lot to me.

21:40.465 --> 21:43.034
( sighs )
All right.

21:43.036 --> 21:44.935
I can repair
your amulet,

21:44.937 --> 21:47.371
but the magic only works
if you close your eyes.

21:47.373 --> 21:48.839
Right. Okay.

21:52.811 --> 21:55.179
Switcherwitchitus switcheroo!

22:03.855 --> 22:05.122
All right.

22:05.124 --> 22:07.992
Your amulet should be
as good as new.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.995
Oh, Mr. Cedric,
you've made me
so, so happy.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.897
I've gotta go.
Thank you.

22:15.100 --> 22:17.902
You gave
the amulet back?

22:17.904 --> 22:20.871
It was the only way to get rid
of the curse, Mummy.

22:20.873 --> 22:25.276
Then I suppose returning it
was the right thing to do.

22:25.278 --> 22:28.279
It's a shame it had
to come to that.

22:28.281 --> 22:31.148
Mia, Robin, Clover.

22:31.150 --> 22:32.983
Sofia!

22:32.985 --> 22:35.453
Mr. Cedric
fixed my amulet.

22:46.298 --> 22:47.965
Who wants to go
for a ride?

22:47.967 --> 22:49.400
I do.

22:55.507 --> 22:57.875
You're the best,
Mr. Cedric.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.978
Well, that's something,
I suppose.

23:00.980 --> 23:04.014
( Sofia laughing )
