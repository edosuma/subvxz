WEBVTT

01:52.989 --> 01:54.949
Move your car, you jerk!

01:55.158 --> 01:57.368
What do you want from my life?

02:56.427 --> 02:59.931
- Are you fucking deaf? Move!
- Get out of the way!

03:00.431 --> 03:02.433
You deaf? Look behind you!

03:02.600 --> 03:04.561
You're blocking traffic!

03:05.186 --> 03:06.521
Get off the street!

03:06.688 --> 03:09.774
What do you want me
to do? Tell him!

03:09.941 --> 03:11.693
You dumb idiot!

03:13.778 --> 03:15.780
I'm turning here, you idiot!

03:15.989 --> 03:18.199
Where you from, Oshkosh?

03:18.825 --> 03:19.868
Idiot!

03:28.793 --> 03:31.963
Watch your step.
You're a dumb idiot!

03:32.171 --> 03:35.133
Talking to me?
You are a dumb idiot!

03:35.300 --> 03:38.887
- You talking to me?
- Wally, don't start anything.

03:39.095 --> 03:42.307
The man's got something to say.
Up yours!

03:42.515 --> 03:44.475
I heard that song before.

03:44.642 --> 03:46.561
Anything to get off your chest?

03:46.728 --> 03:48.313
Tell me who you're talking to.

03:48.521 --> 03:52.734
No, say one more word.
One more fucking word.
Come on!

03:52.942 --> 03:56.654
- You dumb asshole!
- Hey, nice move!

03:56.821 --> 04:01.284
Come on! You don't show me shit!
Who are you fighting this time?

04:01.492 --> 04:04.537
Wally! Wally, stop it!
Stop it!

04:04.746 --> 04:08.666
Come on. Come on.
Going up. Step up.

04:08.875 --> 04:11.836
Fuck you.
Going down.

04:24.265 --> 04:29.020
Why do you feel you have
to pass for someone with
20/20 vision when you're blind?

04:29.187 --> 04:31.689
I don't feel I have to pass.
You do.

04:31.898 --> 04:36.235
It's a sickness, like if you
were trying to pass for white.

04:36.861 --> 04:40.031
You mean I'm not white?
Oh, sit down.

04:40.198 --> 04:43.368
This is a scandal!
I'm not white?!

04:43.534 --> 04:45.828
Why didn't you tell me before?

04:46.037 --> 04:48.498
You're my own sister!
Sit down, Wally.

04:48.665 --> 04:51.834
Goodness! A lot of
adjustments have to be made.

04:52.001 --> 04:56.506
Cancel the swimming lessons.
What'll the guys at the club say?

04:56.673 --> 04:59.175
I'm not white!
Oh, it feels like it.

04:59.342 --> 05:00.969
Ha, ha. Aah!

05:01.177 --> 05:02.887
Goodness, you're right!

05:03.721 --> 05:07.016
Lord, help me.
Does Dad know?

05:07.183 --> 05:10.311
Twenty dollars across the board
on Centipede.

05:11.104 --> 05:14.065
Thank you very much.
Oh, just a minute.

05:15.191 --> 05:18.569
You said that was all.
But I want my 50.

05:18.736 --> 05:20.738
You know how much
you owe that bookie?

05:20.905 --> 05:23.533
- I don't want a lecture.
- Give me my $50.

05:23.700 --> 05:26.786
This is the last %50
to your name, Wally.

05:26.995 --> 05:28.746
I know, but $50, please.

05:28.913 --> 05:34.419
<i>- Three minutes until post time.
- Three minutes until post time.</i>

05:34.585 --> 05:37.714
And $50 to win on Centipede.

05:37.880 --> 05:40.925
Come on, Centipede!
You can do it!

05:41.801 --> 05:43.678
Come on! Come on!

05:43.845 --> 05:45.471
Come on!

05:46.097 --> 05:47.890
You can do it!

05:49.600 --> 05:50.935
Come on, you bitch!

06:03.656 --> 06:06.576
Who won?
It wasn't Centipede.

06:06.784 --> 06:08.161
Shit!

06:08.661 --> 06:13.166
You shouldn't have quit your job!
The man treated me like I was blind.

06:13.374 --> 06:17.003
So try someone else!
You can't go on like this, Wally.

06:17.211 --> 06:18.463
Get another job.

06:30.683 --> 06:31.976
Mr. Lyons!

06:32.643 --> 06:35.396
What's the matter with me?
Uh...

06:36.564 --> 06:41.235
Mr. Lyons, the fire inspector

06:41.444 --> 06:44.363
wants you to pick up papers.

06:44.572 --> 06:48.951
Much dangerous. Big fire.

06:49.160 --> 06:53.539
You must please sweep up
before you close the shop.

06:53.748 --> 06:58.461
Mr. Huddelston, there's a vicious
rumor going around that I'm deaf.

06:58.628 --> 07:01.672
I don't like it.
It's very humiliating.

07:01.839 --> 07:03.841
Let's try and put a stop to it.

07:04.008 --> 07:05.927
Oh, I feel like such a fool.

07:06.094 --> 07:08.262
That inspector?
Don't worry about him.

07:08.429 --> 07:11.808
He's always coming around
trying to get bribes.

07:12.016 --> 07:15.812
You don't read lips?
They told me you had
to read my lips.

07:16.270 --> 07:17.688
I feel like an ass.

07:17.897 --> 07:21.150
Especially on the last Thursday
of every month.

07:36.874 --> 07:38.167
Sorry.

07:39.418 --> 07:43.381
- I can't make a left turn.
- I'll have to swing around the block.

07:43.589 --> 07:45.591
Whoa. You're not parking anywhere.

07:45.758 --> 07:48.970
Slow down and just pull over
here by the curb.

07:49.137 --> 07:50.638
What are you talking about?

07:50.805 --> 07:53.808
- I'm not a baby.
- I don't need a babysitter.

07:53.975 --> 07:56.394
Just point me
in the right direction.

07:56.602 --> 07:58.688
Point you? Are you crazy?
Yes.

07:58.896 --> 08:01.899
Take your cane or you
won't make it across.

08:02.066 --> 08:05.361
No. Put the cane--
What is--? Put it down.

08:05.570 --> 08:09.240
I can hear, can't I?
All I need is Big Mo.

08:12.076 --> 08:13.828
I want to see this.

08:14.745 --> 08:15.830
Here.

08:17.165 --> 08:18.207
Thank you.

08:21.961 --> 08:23.921
Good luck with the job.

08:27.842 --> 08:30.928
Excuse me, sir.
Nice day, isn't it?

08:44.775 --> 08:46.402
So far, so good.

08:47.320 --> 08:49.655
I'll pick you up
in front of the building.

08:49.822 --> 08:52.450
Remember, wait for the beeps.

08:52.617 --> 08:56.329
Wait for the beeps.
Yeah, wait for the beep.

08:56.537 --> 08:58.873
I will. Thank you.
What?

08:59.081 --> 09:01.500
Would you help me across?

09:01.709 --> 09:04.170
Yeah, uh, take my arm.

09:09.967 --> 09:11.427
Here we go.

09:30.404 --> 09:32.406
Hey, sis, how am I doing?

09:32.573 --> 09:34.992
Great. Just great.

09:35.201 --> 09:38.329
Thank you very much.
You don't have to thank me, sir.

09:38.496 --> 09:41.832
After all, this to me
is just fun.

09:42.041 --> 09:43.876
Like a walk in the park.

09:44.085 --> 09:47.630
Here you are. If you get
in any trouble, just holler.

09:52.510 --> 09:56.097
Can I help you?
I'm here about the ad in the paper.

09:56.305 --> 09:59.016
"Salesman wanted.
Must have sense of humor."

09:59.183 --> 10:01.269
Are you the owner
of the shop, sir?

10:01.477 --> 10:03.187
Who are you talking to?

10:03.896 --> 10:06.274
Oh, there you are. Damn.

10:06.482 --> 10:09.193
Look at that. Contacts again.
See that?

10:09.527 --> 10:10.736
Oh.

10:10.903 --> 10:13.030
I'm looking for Mr. David Lyons.

10:13.197 --> 10:16.867
I'm David Lyons.
Pleased to meet you. Oh, I'm sorry.

10:17.034 --> 10:19.870
I read your ad in the paper
about an Ivy League type.

10:20.079 --> 10:23.749
Tall, dark, handsome.
Three out of four ain't bad, right?

10:23.958 --> 10:25.501
You can see I'm nervous.

10:25.668 --> 10:28.963
Really want the job.
But I am a damned
good salesman.

10:29.547 --> 10:32.049
I'm David Lyons.
What can I do for you?

10:32.216 --> 10:33.467
Uh-oh. Ooh. Heh.

10:33.634 --> 10:37.096
Are we caught in a time warp here?
<i>Twilight Zone</i>, maybe?

10:38.889 --> 10:42.143
Any Martians here
who want to speak
to Mr. David Lyons?

10:44.562 --> 10:49.567
Ha, ha. You're a funny guy.
I really like that ad you put
in the paper.

10:49.734 --> 10:53.195
"Must have a sense of humor."
Not many people would do that.

10:53.404 --> 10:56.407
I'm your guy.
If you want me, here I am.

10:56.574 --> 10:59.535
Would you tell me what you want.
Three-fifty.

11:00.328 --> 11:03.914
What are you talking about?!

11:04.081 --> 11:05.875
Three hundred, but that's it.

11:06.042 --> 11:08.419
Are you talking to me?
225!

11:08.586 --> 11:12.590
Listen, man, $225 a week.

11:12.757 --> 11:16.761
200. I can't live on less than that.
Who are you talking to?

11:17.511 --> 11:20.514
I'm talking to you, you prick!
What do you say?

11:20.723 --> 11:23.809
Look me in the eye and say that.
I would if I could,

11:23.976 --> 11:26.896
but I can't. I'm blind.

11:28.272 --> 11:31.442
You're blind?
Yes. Now can I have the job?

11:31.609 --> 11:34.487
I had no idea. I'm sorry.

11:34.695 --> 11:37.698
Now you know.
Can I get the job?

11:38.699 --> 11:43.204
You're really blind?
Yes. What are you, fucking deaf?

11:43.371 --> 11:47.666
Yes! I'm fucking deaf!
Deaf?

11:47.875 --> 11:50.503
Yes, I'm deaf.
You really deaf?

11:50.711 --> 11:53.464
I'm really deaf.
How do you know what I'm saying?

11:53.631 --> 11:56.926
I'm reading your lips.
Do you want the job or don't you?

11:57.426 --> 12:00.471
Because I'm blind?
Shove it up your ass, pal.

12:00.638 --> 12:02.473
I don't want no favors.

12:02.681 --> 12:06.143
Then go home! Get out!
Give me some peace of mind.

12:06.310 --> 12:09.230
To hell with blind people!
Just walk out.

12:09.438 --> 12:13.401
That's better.
Now, I believe we agreed on 300.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.653
300 what?
What are we talking about?

12:15.820 --> 12:18.989
Just a minute, hold everything.
Stop the music.

12:19.532 --> 12:22.451
Do you like Harvey Wallbangers?
Harvey who?

12:22.660 --> 12:25.955
Wallbangers. A friend of mine.
I'll introduce you to it later.

12:26.163 --> 12:28.958
Because tonight, my friend,
we celebrate!

12:30.251 --> 12:31.293
Not bad.

12:31.460 --> 12:35.339
Did I hit the board?
No, you hit the wall. It's a lot better.

12:36.507 --> 12:38.384
Three Wallbangers, Wally.

12:38.843 --> 12:41.762
Drink time.
Where's your friend?

12:41.971 --> 12:45.516
Oh, he's coming.
Should be here soon.
You're gonna like him.

12:45.724 --> 12:48.853
This is to you, Sally. Sally?
Here.

12:49.019 --> 12:53.149
Oh. And to you, Leslie.
Thanks for buying the drinks.

12:53.357 --> 12:54.525
My pleasure.

12:55.734 --> 12:57.445
What's your friend look like?

12:57.611 --> 13:00.448
I've never seen him,
but he smells real good.

13:00.656 --> 13:02.658
I think he's by the door.

13:04.118 --> 13:05.661
Dave!

13:06.078 --> 13:07.913
Dave, yo!

13:12.376 --> 13:14.753
Hi.
Dave!

13:15.379 --> 13:17.548
Over here!
Hello, I'm here.

13:17.715 --> 13:18.757
Hi.
Dave.

13:18.924 --> 13:20.968
I want you to meet friends
of mine.

13:21.177 --> 13:23.012
This is Sally.
Hi.

13:23.179 --> 13:24.889
How do you do?
Nice to meet you.

13:25.055 --> 13:29.059
And this lovely lady
to my left here, this is Lisa.

13:29.268 --> 13:32.480
Leslie. Hi.
Leslie, hi.

13:32.688 --> 13:35.357
And this is my good friend,
David Lyons.

13:35.566 --> 13:38.402
Wally says you're forming
a business together.

13:38.569 --> 13:40.738
Congratulations.
Wally says what?

13:40.946 --> 13:44.909
Whoa. Let's not talk about
that now. Let's talk about
Harvey Wallbanger.

13:45.075 --> 13:49.121
That's who you want me to meet?
Yeah! Bartender.

13:49.330 --> 13:52.166
Hey, asshole.
Who do you think you are?

13:52.333 --> 13:56.504
David Lyons.
You must be Harvey Wallbanger.
Wally's told me about you.

13:56.712 --> 13:59.423
Yeah, real comedian.
Get off my jacket!

13:59.590 --> 14:00.925
Listen, asswipe.

14:01.091 --> 14:04.136
You watch yourself
or you're gonna be
going home early.

14:04.345 --> 14:05.971
I didn't know I was
standing on your jacket.

14:06.180 --> 14:09.517
What are you, the constable?
Who's your girlfriend?

14:09.892 --> 14:13.521
Oh. Heh. I think I heard
my mating call. Stand up.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.189
- I am standing.
- Wait.

14:15.356 --> 14:17.816
I don't think you understand.
My friend--

14:18.025 --> 14:21.111
Is a killer, that's what I am.
A trained killer!

14:21.612 --> 14:24.114
Oh, Special Forces.

14:24.281 --> 14:26.492
When I was in the Corps,

14:26.700 --> 14:29.787
we used to eat you
Green Beret pussies
for breakfast.

14:29.995 --> 14:32.414
Eat this!
This guy's tough, Wally.

14:32.623 --> 14:36.961
If I hear him, I can hit him.
He'd put a hole through your head.

14:37.127 --> 14:40.464
So you ain't talking now, huh?

14:41.382 --> 14:44.802
Come on, big mouth, say something.
Let's get down.

14:44.969 --> 14:47.471
Come on. Last night
I was out with your sister.

14:47.680 --> 14:50.224
- Okay, butthead.
- Hey!

14:51.642 --> 14:54.645
You're all right, champ.
He's coming.

14:54.812 --> 14:56.772
I'll give you the first hit.
Come on.

14:56.939 --> 14:59.358
He's coming, Wally.
He's coming.

14:59.567 --> 15:02.319
Lower, he's a couple inches
shorter than you.

15:02.486 --> 15:04.321
- Aim for 12 o'clock.
- Hit him!

15:05.155 --> 15:08.492
All right.
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

15:09.243 --> 15:10.452
Eleven o'clock!

15:11.829 --> 15:12.871
Ooh!

15:14.373 --> 15:17.376
- Circle right. Circle right.
- Circle right.

15:17.585 --> 15:20.504
And left, left, left. Circle left.

15:20.671 --> 15:24.091
Circle left. And right!
Right, circle right.

15:24.300 --> 15:26.427
Circle left. Left.
Stand still!

15:27.177 --> 15:29.972
Get ready! One o'clock!
Good. Good.

15:30.180 --> 15:31.599
Twelve!

15:32.266 --> 15:34.685
Five to three. I got mixed up!

15:34.852 --> 15:36.478
Argh!

15:36.687 --> 15:38.647
Circle left. Circle left.

15:38.814 --> 15:40.524
Shut up and let him fight.

15:40.691 --> 15:42.026
Move right. Move right.

15:43.027 --> 15:44.028
Get ready!

15:44.236 --> 15:46.739
Hey, I said shut the fuck up!

15:47.323 --> 15:50.159
Wha--?
Read my lips, asshole!

15:50.326 --> 15:51.994
I got that.

15:52.578 --> 15:53.996
Wally.

15:55.456 --> 15:56.624
Dave!

15:57.875 --> 15:59.126
Dave!

15:59.293 --> 16:00.377
One o'clock!

16:02.338 --> 16:04.006
Son of a bitch!

16:04.173 --> 16:07.217
You little son of a bitch.
You had enough?

16:07.384 --> 16:09.094
Little creep!

16:18.687 --> 16:21.482
How are you doing?
I'm doing great!

16:21.690 --> 16:23.859
We should hang out more often.

16:24.026 --> 16:27.404
Yeah, it's nice to unwind
after work.

16:27.571 --> 16:29.740
Does that mean I get the job?

16:30.199 --> 16:34.662
Depends on how this fight
comes out.

16:36.664 --> 16:40.668
So I bought this big bottle
of champagne.

16:40.876 --> 16:43.253
Must've cost 45 bucks.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.924
I asked my sister to drop
me off at Jones Beach.

16:47.966 --> 16:51.679
I sat myself down in the sand,
started drinking,

16:52.429 --> 16:56.225
and sneaking peeks to see
if people was watching me cry.

16:56.433 --> 17:00.979
Then I realized it didn't matter,
because I couldn't see them anyway.

17:01.188 --> 17:03.232
That's when I made a decision.

17:03.440 --> 17:07.027
I wasn't gonna piss my life away
because of anger.

17:07.819 --> 17:11.699
That's when I decided,
blind or not blind,

17:12.574 --> 17:16.412
I was gonna be the same lovable
asshole I've always been.

17:20.457 --> 17:22.960
You haven't made that
decision yet, have you?

17:23.127 --> 17:24.252
No.

17:26.839 --> 17:29.883
How'd you become an actor
if you're deaf?

17:31.552 --> 17:34.972
I wasn't born deaf.
I got scarlet fever in high school.

17:35.180 --> 17:38.559
I didn't lose all my hearing
until eight years ago.

17:39.476 --> 17:40.811
Why'd you stop acting?

17:41.311 --> 17:44.940
I started missing my cues
when the other actors would turn.

17:45.149 --> 17:47.067
I couldn't see their lips.

17:48.026 --> 17:49.653
They ever catch you?

17:50.696 --> 17:54.992
No, I don't think anyone knew.
I just lost my nerve.

17:55.909 --> 18:00.164
When's the last time you were--?
Sorry, you were eating. What?

18:00.372 --> 18:04.293
Laid!
The last time you were laid!

18:06.003 --> 18:09.673
Too sad.
Next subject, please.

18:10.549 --> 18:12.050
You don't want to know.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.927
So where's your wife?

18:14.344 --> 18:17.139
Cleveland. I haven't seen her
for eight years.

18:17.347 --> 18:18.682
Nice lady?

18:18.891 --> 18:22.561
Very nice.
Wonderful, warm woman.

18:25.314 --> 18:29.067
And then one day,
she turned into this creature

18:29.276 --> 18:32.321
who could sit on the end
of a broomstick

18:32.529 --> 18:35.365
and take off into the air.

18:35.532 --> 18:37.534
She could actually
achieve flight.

18:37.826 --> 18:40.537
Wow. I think I was married
to that lady.

18:40.704 --> 18:42.122
Small world.

18:42.331 --> 18:44.500
Funny thing is,
this didn't happen to her

18:44.666 --> 18:48.337
till just about the same time
I went completely deaf. Coincidence?

18:48.504 --> 18:51.048
Amazing. Who'd believe it?

18:51.715 --> 18:55.260
So, what do you want out of life
before the show's over?

18:56.887 --> 18:59.681
Just not to make a fool out of myself.

19:00.557 --> 19:01.975
That's all you want?

19:02.810 --> 19:05.646
I have this terrible fear

19:05.854 --> 19:08.357
that I'm gonna make some mistake

19:08.565 --> 19:12.694
and everyone's gonna
stand around and stare at me.

19:12.861 --> 19:17.115
Boy, damn. I wish I had
met you eight years ago.

19:17.324 --> 19:20.160
I can fix all your problems
in 10 seconds.

19:20.327 --> 19:21.411
Ten seconds?

19:21.578 --> 19:24.665
Ten seconds, if you trust me.
You trust me?

19:28.168 --> 19:30.128
Yeah, sure.

19:31.755 --> 19:33.090
Listen.

19:38.262 --> 19:40.722
Hey, you're a good-looking guy.

19:40.931 --> 19:43.809
Thank you.
That's very kind of you.

19:46.687 --> 19:48.856
How's that feel? Good?

19:49.857 --> 19:53.944
Look a little silly to me.
Kind of foolish.

19:56.864 --> 20:00.284
You see?
Life ain't so complicated.

20:19.261 --> 20:22.806
When's the next coming, Ray?
Any second.

20:23.015 --> 20:27.561
That might be
the truck coming now.
I gotta go get a screwdriver.

20:30.606 --> 20:33.525
So, uh, the blind guy around?

20:36.778 --> 20:38.113
Hey.

20:40.824 --> 20:41.992
Oh.

20:42.659 --> 20:45.412
Where's the blind guy?
Who do you want?

20:45.579 --> 20:48.165
Kerew. Wally Kerew.
I'm his bookie.

20:48.332 --> 20:49.917
I owe him some money.

20:51.710 --> 20:55.589
Well, he's waiting for a delivery.
He'll be back in a minute.

20:55.797 --> 20:58.842
Where's he, out front?
I'll go find him.

21:04.264 --> 21:06.683
I almost forgot.
I need some, uh--

21:06.850 --> 21:10.020
Some, I don't know--
We're not open yet.

21:10.187 --> 21:14.024
I know. Listen, I need some
of that stuff up there.

21:14.191 --> 21:17.694
My tummy's all kaput.
What is that stuff up there?

21:17.903 --> 21:19.863
The antacids?
Yeah, listen.

21:20.072 --> 21:23.951
What's the difference between
Alka-Seltzer and the one next to it?

21:24.159 --> 21:25.327
Di-Gel?

21:25.494 --> 21:28.705
Yeah. Can you do me a favor.
Would you read it to me?

21:28.872 --> 21:31.041
You want me to read out Di-Gel?

21:31.208 --> 21:34.670
Yeah, my eyes ain't too good.
Just read it, please?

21:34.878 --> 21:36.129
Jesus.

21:39.007 --> 21:42.386
Uh, "Di-Gel contains
calcium carbonate,

21:42.594 --> 21:45.806
an effective antacid.
It is also..."

21:46.014 --> 21:48.058
Where are you going?
Here, take it.

21:48.266 --> 21:50.811
I wasn't trying
to pull anything. Honestly.

21:51.019 --> 21:53.647
You were told to deliver this
from the airport.

21:53.814 --> 21:56.608
I thought I was being tailed.
I thought it was the cops.

21:56.817 --> 22:00.112
I didn't want to bring them
near Mr. Sutherland.
Tell him that.

22:00.278 --> 22:03.156
No, you tell him that.
I've got a car out front.

22:03.323 --> 22:05.575
Come on,
I'm dead if I go with you.

22:06.118 --> 22:08.036
You're dead
if you don't go with me.

22:16.336 --> 22:20.674
"--bubbles of gas trapped in
the stomach can cause heartburn,

22:20.882 --> 22:24.052
acid indigestion
and that full, bloated feeling.

22:24.219 --> 22:26.221
And unlike plain antacids,

22:26.388 --> 22:29.725
the simethicone
breaks up gas bubbles rapidly

22:29.933 --> 22:33.186
to relieve fullness and pressure."

22:33.395 --> 22:35.272
I feel like a commercial.

22:49.619 --> 22:51.747
What the hell was that?

22:52.372 --> 22:53.415
Wait a minute.

22:53.582 --> 22:56.251
Wait, my ass!
I thought I heard--

23:00.797 --> 23:02.841
What is this, hide-and-seek?

23:08.263 --> 23:10.182
What? What's this?

23:10.348 --> 23:11.516
Hey. Ooh.

23:13.477 --> 23:16.146
Hello?
Oh, no!

23:16.354 --> 23:19.566
This guy's dead.
Wally, there's a gun here.

23:19.775 --> 23:20.901
Don't touch it.

23:21.068 --> 23:22.194
Move it!

23:23.070 --> 23:24.154
Freeze!

23:24.321 --> 23:26.073
Drop it! I said drop it!

23:26.281 --> 23:28.366
What did he say?
You holding a weapon?

23:28.575 --> 23:31.161
Yes, I am.
Throw it away! Get rid of it!

23:32.913 --> 23:34.122
Stay there!
Freeze!

23:34.289 --> 23:35.332
Don't shoot!

23:35.499 --> 23:36.833
I'll blow your brains out.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.127
Wait.
Shut up!

23:39.294 --> 23:40.337
Please, be gentle.

23:42.005 --> 23:43.465
Let's go.
Wait.

23:43.673 --> 23:48.178
You don't think I had
anything to do with this.
He came for Alka-Seltzer.

23:48.345 --> 23:51.932
The man asked me
to read him a Di-Gel label.
Can you believe that?

23:52.099 --> 23:54.601
We don't even know the man.

23:54.768 --> 23:58.188
Wally, get the money from the box.
Yeah.

23:58.355 --> 24:01.024
Officer, excuse me,
isn't there some

24:01.233 --> 24:04.945
nice way we can settle this?
Can I get my coat?

24:05.112 --> 24:07.906
- Hang on, we'll get your coats.
- Jesus!

24:08.115 --> 24:11.660
Wally, tell Mr. Huddelston
to lock up for us.

24:11.827 --> 24:13.328
Yeah.

24:16.706 --> 24:19.209
- Open it up.
- You're sick!

24:21.711 --> 24:23.130
Dave?

24:25.048 --> 24:27.050
Dave?
Head down.

24:27.217 --> 24:29.845
- Head down, bring it down.
- Dave?

24:30.554 --> 24:32.597
Watch your leg, watch your leg.

24:32.806 --> 24:36.309
<i>License: one-David-George-x-ray...</i>

24:36.518 --> 24:38.436
All right, let's move out.

24:44.818 --> 24:48.613
You really can't say whether
this mystery woman fired the shot.

24:48.822 --> 24:50.949
No, I can't,
but if she's innocent,

24:51.116 --> 24:54.119
why did she leave
right after the shot was fired?

24:54.286 --> 24:56.413
That makes sense.
Gatlin.

25:00.292 --> 25:04.421
What's the story? I got the
commissioner crawling up my ass.

25:04.588 --> 25:06.590
The whole thing sounds shaky.

25:06.756 --> 25:09.843
The deaf guy, he's not
so sure about the woman.

25:10.051 --> 25:13.305
The blind guy heard the shot,
but can't make an identification.

25:13.471 --> 25:16.766
For chrissakes,
you're feeling too sorry for them.

25:16.975 --> 25:20.270
You're always feeling
sorry for people.
That's your trouble.

25:20.478 --> 25:23.231
All right, I'll take care of this.

25:26.610 --> 25:27.944
Oh.

25:29.613 --> 25:32.949
We're gonna quit fucking around
and start talking serious.

25:33.116 --> 25:34.951
You claim there was a woman?

25:37.829 --> 25:39.915
Was there a woman present?

25:43.001 --> 25:46.379
Was there a woman present?
Oh, sorry. You talking to me?

25:46.546 --> 25:49.633
You bet your ass I am.
Was there or wasn't there?

25:49.799 --> 25:53.470
Was there or wasn't there what?
A woman present!

25:53.637 --> 25:56.473
I smelled a woman,
but I didn't see a woman.

25:58.600 --> 26:02.520
What about you, wiseass?
Was there or wasn't there
a woman?

26:04.064 --> 26:05.482
What do I have to do?

26:05.649 --> 26:09.152
Take you downstairs to
a private room and ask you?
Huh?

26:09.319 --> 26:12.322
He's deaf.
You have to be facing him.

26:12.739 --> 26:17.327
Jesus. All right, no more bullshit!
Was there or wasn't there a woman?

26:18.411 --> 26:21.164
Are you serious?
Yes, I'm goddamn serious.

26:21.665 --> 26:23.291
Fuzzy Wuzzy was a woman?

26:24.459 --> 26:28.630
What is he talking about?
He reads lips. You're talking too fast.

26:33.009 --> 26:35.053
Was there

26:35.262 --> 26:39.849
a woman present?

26:40.016 --> 26:41.393
Yes,

26:41.559 --> 26:44.062
there was

26:44.271 --> 26:48.441
a woman

26:48.650 --> 26:50.902
present.

26:51.069 --> 26:52.570
Why is he talking like that?

26:52.737 --> 26:59.244
Because he's deaf, not stupid.

27:02.163 --> 27:05.959
Can you tell me
one goddamn thing
about that woman?

27:06.167 --> 27:10.380
Yes. She has
the most magnificent legs
I've ever seen in my life.

27:10.547 --> 27:14.384
Yeah, and she smells good too.
All right, that does it.

27:14.592 --> 27:17.637
Don't tell me you didn't
hear anything. He heard it.

27:17.846 --> 27:20.765
Don't tell me you didn't
see anything. He saw it.

27:20.974 --> 27:24.394
Between the two of you,
you saw and heard everything!

27:25.312 --> 27:30.191
Some poor bastard's dead,
so let's start answering
some questions here!

27:30.400 --> 27:32.402
Excuse me, captain?
What?

27:32.569 --> 27:35.905
Professor Kasuda.
You'll be interested
in what he's gotta say.

27:36.072 --> 27:38.158
Ballistics report.
What do you got?

27:38.325 --> 27:42.829
I think I can prove to a judge
that both of these men
had the <i>mens rea.</i>

27:44.205 --> 27:46.416
What the hell is a <i>mens rea?</i>

27:46.583 --> 27:48.043
It's a legal term.

27:48.209 --> 27:51.671
It just means the intention
to commit a crime.

27:52.422 --> 27:54.799
- Okay, come on, let's go.
<i>- Mens rea?</i>

27:55.008 --> 27:57.927
Put the cuffs on.
How could we have gotten <i>mens rea?</i>

27:58.094 --> 27:59.929
- Don't worry.
- Get up.

28:00.138 --> 28:02.307
- Did we take blood?
- Get up!

28:02.515 --> 28:06.770
Will you please rise?
Can you do it without taking blood?

28:06.936 --> 28:10.440
Stupid, he's deaf.
You have to be facing him!

28:10.648 --> 28:13.068
The lab says that gun
was the death weapon.

28:13.234 --> 28:15.612
But we both use condoms.
How's this possible?

28:15.820 --> 28:19.657
I wanna see a lawyer!
I wanna see a doctor.

28:19.866 --> 28:22.744
We found something
in the apartment of Mr. Scotto.

28:22.952 --> 28:25.622
Joey Scotto?
Can I have a blood test?

28:25.789 --> 28:28.833
We found your name on a marker
in Mr. Scotto's wallet.

28:29.042 --> 28:32.170
"W. Kerew, $2800. Overdue."

28:32.379 --> 28:34.297
Because I owe him?
I feel sick.

28:34.464 --> 28:35.882
What are you doing?

28:36.049 --> 28:40.345
You owe, he comes to bust
your head and your boyfriend
lets him have it.

28:40.553 --> 28:42.472
He is not my boyfriend.

28:42.639 --> 28:44.391
<i>Mens rea?</i>

28:46.643 --> 28:49.396
My God! No!

28:52.857 --> 28:53.983
Checkbook,

28:54.275 --> 28:55.985
knife,

28:57.695 --> 28:59.447
racing forms,

28:59.614 --> 29:01.282
pair of undershorts,

29:02.617 --> 29:04.244
and a ticket...

29:06.579 --> 29:09.207
to El Paso, Texas.
It's not here!

29:35.650 --> 29:37.110
No coin.

29:37.861 --> 29:41.698
I wish I hadn't killed him.
No, no. If you had to, you had to.

29:41.865 --> 29:46.327
Now, we know he had it
at the airport. So he must've
made a switch over somewhere.

29:46.661 --> 29:49.706
The man who owns
the newsstand,
David Lyons.

29:49.873 --> 29:52.208
He was talking with Scotto
when I arrived.

29:52.375 --> 29:54.210
Would he be able
to identify you?

29:55.086 --> 29:58.715
No. He never saw me.
Also, he's deaf.

29:59.299 --> 30:02.051
Deaf?
Deaf.

30:02.218 --> 30:04.929
And the other one is blind.

30:05.221 --> 30:07.223
Blind? Deaf?
What, is this a joke?

30:07.932 --> 30:10.977
No, no joke. I spoke with
the building superintendent.

30:11.144 --> 30:13.646
Well, let's go pay them a visit,
shall we?

30:14.689 --> 30:16.649
Well, they're in jail now.

30:17.192 --> 30:19.694
Well, then let's bail them out.

30:23.281 --> 30:27.577
All right, Mr. Lyons,
I need a nice full-face shot first.

30:27.744 --> 30:31.289
Then we'll get our side shots later.
You ready?

30:31.498 --> 30:34.667
We're here
because you owed
that sleazeball %2800?

30:34.834 --> 30:36.586
Face forward, please.

30:36.753 --> 30:41.090
I happened to think
the Knicks were gonna
beat Boston. They came close.

30:41.257 --> 30:43.676
Tell your friend
to face the front.

30:43.843 --> 30:45.637
Face front.

30:45.845 --> 30:48.890
What do you need a bookie for?
Credit.

30:49.057 --> 30:50.058
Face front.

30:50.225 --> 30:53.228
He was the only one who would
give me credit. Face front.

30:53.394 --> 30:55.772
Will you tell him to hold still,
please?

30:55.939 --> 30:57.815
What?
Hold still.

31:01.319 --> 31:02.362
What's he doing?

31:03.238 --> 31:04.280
Holding still.

31:05.740 --> 31:08.451
Not looking at you, looking at me!

31:09.786 --> 31:12.247
What?
Face the camera.

31:13.623 --> 31:15.542
Perfect. Tell him not to move.

31:15.875 --> 31:18.127
What?
Don't move.

31:18.378 --> 31:20.463
I'm getting fed up with her.

31:22.131 --> 31:26.469
Why is he doing this to me?
I just want him to face the camera.

31:26.678 --> 31:29.430
He's not facing the camera?
No!

31:29.597 --> 31:31.474
That's news to me.

31:31.724 --> 31:34.310
What?
Face the camera.

31:35.228 --> 31:37.605
That's better. Hold it.

31:37.814 --> 31:40.692
She should make up her mind.
Shit!

31:41.067 --> 31:42.443
Shit!

31:43.152 --> 31:45.989
Shit, shit, shit!

31:46.155 --> 31:49.909
Is she saying "shit" or "ship"?
"Shit."

31:50.076 --> 31:53.288
Shit, shit, shit. Charlie, come here.

31:53.663 --> 31:56.499
Yeah, why would she say,
"Ship, ship, ship"?

31:56.666 --> 31:59.002
I need you.
Wouldn't make any sense.

31:59.168 --> 32:01.754
Get him out of here.
I want him out, now!

32:03.131 --> 32:06.342
You're finished.
I'll get you when
you're sleeping.

32:06.509 --> 32:10.346
We'll be all right. Once they find
that woman, they'll let us out.

32:10.513 --> 32:13.224
What woman? They're not
looking for no woman.

32:13.433 --> 32:15.685
They got their killers. Us.
We're fucked.

32:15.893 --> 32:17.145
Captain, honestly--

32:17.353 --> 32:18.354
Ow!

32:19.022 --> 32:21.190
- You all right?
- What's wrong with you?

32:21.357 --> 32:23.985
Can't you walk?
Do we have to carry you?

32:24.193 --> 32:25.361
Don't do shit for me.

32:25.528 --> 32:28.114
The man is blind and you
have him handcuffed?

32:28.281 --> 32:30.366
Come on.
For crying out loud.

32:30.533 --> 32:34.871
All right, take the cuffs off him
before he wrecks the goddamn joint.

32:35.038 --> 32:36.706
Don't do me no favors.

32:37.415 --> 32:41.336
Is everybody happy now? Huh?
Are we all friends again?

32:41.544 --> 32:44.047
Come on now, let's go, huh?
Jesus.

32:45.173 --> 32:48.259
Joe. I got Lyons, David.
Kerew, Wallace.

32:48.426 --> 32:49.844
Suspected homicide.

32:50.053 --> 32:52.055
- His lawyers are here.
- Whose?

32:52.221 --> 32:55.391
David Lyons'.
My lawyers?

32:55.558 --> 32:59.187
Oh. You want to check him
for police brutality, lady?

32:59.395 --> 33:02.607
You got as long as it takes
to print him. Get in here.

33:03.107 --> 33:05.360
I know you don't know
who we are.

33:05.526 --> 33:07.278
Your right hand, please.

33:07.487 --> 33:10.740
Our law firm represents the building
you have your shop in.

33:10.948 --> 33:13.576
We've been sent
to try to arrange
bail for you.

33:13.743 --> 33:16.412
Great.
That's a nice surprise.

33:16.579 --> 33:20.792
They can only hold you
up to 72 hours before
an arraignment.

33:20.958 --> 33:24.045
But with luck, we'll have you
out of here by 5:00.

33:24.212 --> 33:27.674
We're pushing the
"blind and deaf" angle.
We hope you don't mind.

33:27.840 --> 33:29.884
No.
No, we don't mind. Use it.

33:30.051 --> 33:32.220
We'll see you both very soon.

33:32.512 --> 33:35.098
Excuse me, miss,
have we met before?

33:37.767 --> 33:39.268
No, I don't think so.

33:39.435 --> 33:41.604
Are you wearing
Shalimar perfume?

33:44.148 --> 33:45.900
Yes, I am.

33:47.026 --> 33:49.696
You know,
you have a remarkable nose.

33:50.863 --> 33:53.282
Thank you.
Goodbye.

33:53.950 --> 33:54.951
Goodbye.

33:55.118 --> 33:57.412
I never knew anyone could be
that beautiful.

33:57.578 --> 33:58.955
The lady's got style.

34:01.040 --> 34:04.419
I'd love to go to sleep
listening to a voice like that.

34:07.922 --> 34:09.924
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

34:10.091 --> 34:11.926
The legs.
Yes, I can imagine.

34:12.092 --> 34:13.803
The legs.
The legs. Of course.

34:13.969 --> 34:15.263
It's her!
The killer?

34:15.679 --> 34:18.975
The lady in my shop I was trying
to tell you about? That's her.

34:19.141 --> 34:21.686
The woman is your lawyer?
She's not my lawyer!

34:21.853 --> 34:24.355
Now she's not your lawyer?
That makes sense. Get out.

34:24.563 --> 34:27.108
She's not my lawyer.
That's the lady you want!

34:27.315 --> 34:30.570
How come you couldn't
give me a description?

34:30.777 --> 34:34.364
I only saw her from the rear.
When she came in,
I was looking at her face.

34:34.574 --> 34:38.077
She went around just now,
I saw her tush. That's her!

34:38.286 --> 34:40.413
That's the lady you want.
Stop her!

34:40.621 --> 34:41.664
Stop that lady!

34:41.831 --> 34:45.668
With a little luck, we'll have them
to ourselves by 5:00.

34:45.835 --> 34:49.464
They seem nice.
So was the chicken I ate last night.

34:49.630 --> 34:52.341
Right now, the police
have us for murder,

34:52.550 --> 34:54.635
or we're bailed out
by the killer.

34:54.802 --> 34:57.764
At least my way
we have a chance.
Are you with me?

34:57.972 --> 35:00.224
All right, guys, let's go, huh?

35:00.433 --> 35:03.227
Yes or no?
Yes.

35:05.772 --> 35:08.191
- Come on, move these guys.
- Let's move.

35:08.399 --> 35:11.569
- Come on, let's go.
- We gotta go. I'm sorry.

35:12.236 --> 35:13.279
Come on.

35:19.827 --> 35:24.332
I bet these guys are really
gonna enjoy themselves
on Rikers Island, huh?

35:24.540 --> 35:27.919
I bet you learn to speak Spanish
real quick. Won't that be nice?

35:28.085 --> 35:29.212
Ooh.
Heh, heh.

35:29.378 --> 35:33.382
You know, I hear that they make
the greatest kidney fricassee

35:33.591 --> 35:35.343
with pineapple Jell-O.

35:35.551 --> 35:38.221
It's really special.
All right, party time.

35:38.513 --> 35:40.473
- Aah!
- Hey, what the hell!

35:41.682 --> 35:44.143
- Tell me when. Tell me when!
- Now!

35:45.561 --> 35:48.689
- Hey! Hey, wait a minute!
- Grab them!

35:48.856 --> 35:50.858
Open the goddamn door!

36:04.997 --> 36:07.917
What's going on?
Protestors.

36:08.167 --> 36:12.046
Demonstrators? Good.
Go with the flow. Mix in.

36:25.685 --> 36:28.896
- Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.
- Could I have a word with you?

36:29.105 --> 36:31.274
Now that you're released,
how do you feel?

36:31.440 --> 36:34.235
Great.
Do you think you can stop Khomeini?

36:35.152 --> 36:36.195
Not if it's funny.

36:36.362 --> 36:39.448
A good comedy, as you call it,
is worth its weight in gold.

36:39.615 --> 36:41.951
Have you read Norman Cousins
about the immune system?

36:42.118 --> 36:45.246
Hey, baby, come on. Comedy.
Ha-ha-ha.

36:45.413 --> 36:48.833
Hey, when is this gonna be on?
I want my sister to tape it.

36:53.170 --> 36:54.922
Uh, thank you.

36:56.465 --> 37:00.136
As you can see,
this remains
a complicated issue.

37:00.303 --> 37:03.931
How could we lose
a blind guy
and a deaf guy?

37:04.140 --> 37:07.268
Son of a bitch!
I want these guys. Now!

37:07.643 --> 37:09.812
Calm down. Just calm down.
We'll get them.

37:10.021 --> 37:12.481
Yeah, we better get them.
We better get them.

37:12.648 --> 37:14.317
Careful. Careful.

37:14.525 --> 37:15.735
Turn left.

37:19.488 --> 37:21.240
Wait. Let's try the door.

37:21.449 --> 37:23.367
There's a hole here, Wally.

37:23.618 --> 37:26.412
Put your fingers
right in here. Pull.

37:28.873 --> 37:30.166
There's an alley!
Dave!

37:30.333 --> 37:33.753
I'm right here. I'm right here.
Step down. Step down once.

37:33.961 --> 37:35.296
Follow me. Careful.

37:35.504 --> 37:39.175
There's an alley right here. Careful.
Turn right. Turn right.

37:41.344 --> 37:43.012
Here's another door.

37:45.681 --> 37:47.099
It's open.

37:47.308 --> 37:48.476
Go on in.

37:49.685 --> 37:52.396
Kerew is blind. Repeat, blind.

37:52.605 --> 37:56.108
Lyons, David, 5'10",
Caucasian, blond hair.

37:56.317 --> 37:59.070
Lyons is deaf. Repeat, deaf.

37:59.278 --> 38:03.741
Form barricades. 6th Avenue
to Hudson, Houston to West 4th.

38:03.950 --> 38:06.369
Every available cruiser,
scramble now.

38:10.539 --> 38:14.919
How does someone so beautiful
kill somebody? I don't understand.

38:15.127 --> 38:18.339
Careful. The broken wood
is in front of you.

38:19.090 --> 38:20.424
That's it.

38:22.218 --> 38:23.719
Oh, wait a minute.

38:25.096 --> 38:26.555
Hold my head.

38:27.181 --> 38:28.516
Hold my head.
Okay.

38:28.724 --> 38:30.184
Oh, hold my head.

38:31.727 --> 38:33.938
Thank you. Ah. Ow.

38:34.105 --> 38:35.398
Are you all right?

38:35.564 --> 38:37.191
Thank you very much.

38:44.031 --> 38:48.661
They told me to call back
in 10 minutes. The judge is
just getting out of court now.

38:48.869 --> 38:50.913
We can have them
in half an hour.

38:51.580 --> 38:52.957
This way, Wally.

38:53.165 --> 38:57.086
Don't guide me. Don't guide me.
What?

38:57.294 --> 39:00.047
They're looking for
a blind guy and deaf guy.

39:00.214 --> 39:02.174
We gotta get out
of the neighborhood.

39:02.341 --> 39:04.593
You won't make it.
You'll crack your head.

39:04.760 --> 39:07.513
Not if you stamp your feet.
If I what?

39:07.722 --> 39:10.808
Stamp your feet.
I'll follow the sound.

39:13.561 --> 39:14.812
Like this?
Louder.

39:15.021 --> 39:18.024
I can hear the noise.
I'll follow you.

39:18.315 --> 39:21.861
That's good! Now move out!
Jesus.

39:22.069 --> 39:24.155
We gotta find the subway.

39:25.906 --> 39:29.618
I feel ridiculous.
You look fine to me!

39:30.202 --> 39:32.955
I think we should kill them.
We have to.

39:33.289 --> 39:35.499
We don't want them
to identify us.

39:35.708 --> 39:38.002
It's not up to me.
It's up to Sutherland.

39:38.210 --> 39:40.546
If he wants us to kill them,
we'll kill them.

39:40.755 --> 39:44.633
Right now,
I just want to get them out
of there and get the coin.

39:50.681 --> 39:53.642
Mr. Kerew?
How did you get out of jail?

39:53.809 --> 39:56.520
Who is it?
It's all right. It's us.

39:56.729 --> 39:59.815
Your lawyers.
Shalimar.

39:59.982 --> 40:02.818
That's right.
Shalimar.

40:04.153 --> 40:06.072
What is Mr. Lyons
doing?

40:06.280 --> 40:09.075
- He's going to the bathroom.
- He's gotta go real bad.

40:09.283 --> 40:14.121
And I told him,
if you gotta go,
you gotta go! Go!

40:14.288 --> 40:17.416
Wally?
Yeah, don't worry about me.

40:17.583 --> 40:20.169
You go on without me!
I'll catch up later.

40:20.336 --> 40:22.963
When you gotta go,
you gotta go, you know?

40:23.172 --> 40:25.341
Not everybody can
stand around and wait!

40:25.508 --> 40:28.052
Just go!
Don't worry about me, okay?

40:28.260 --> 40:31.013
I'll catch up with you later!
Do you hear me?

40:31.180 --> 40:32.848
Sure. I hear you fine.

40:34.517 --> 40:36.685
You snuck up on me.
Damn you.

40:37.353 --> 40:40.815
You're close enough now.
You can read my lips.

40:41.023 --> 40:42.316
Yes, I can.

40:42.525 --> 40:44.610
Guess who I ran into today?
Who?

40:46.487 --> 40:48.364
<i>The killers.</i>

40:49.657 --> 40:52.368
The, uh, kidders?

40:52.535 --> 40:55.538
Where did you learn
to lip-read, underwater?

40:56.330 --> 41:00.417
The "killers," Mr. Lyons.
The killers.

41:00.626 --> 41:03.129
May I have the coin,
Mr. Kerew?

41:03.379 --> 41:05.381
What coin are we talking about?

41:06.799 --> 41:08.592
They may not know they have it.

41:12.012 --> 41:13.848
Excuse me.

41:14.014 --> 41:16.559
Let's see if I can find it.

41:18.227 --> 41:22.314
I don't know what you're looking for,
but it's a little to the right.

41:24.400 --> 41:25.818
Oh...

41:26.402 --> 41:27.695
Here it is.

41:27.862 --> 41:32.074
Here what is?
It's a rare gold coin, Mr. Kerew.

41:32.366 --> 41:37.246
Very valuable. Mr. Scotto
put it in your cigar box
before he passed away.

41:37.413 --> 41:39.999
You mean I've had it
all the time?

41:40.291 --> 41:43.544
Well, now what?
You know how I feel.

41:43.919 --> 41:45.713
Can we go now?

41:45.963 --> 41:49.008
I'll call our employer
and find out.

41:53.387 --> 41:57.433
Say, my man--
Mr. Kerew, not so fast.

41:57.683 --> 42:01.103
I wanted to know,
you make a lot of money
in this line of work?

42:01.270 --> 42:05.232
Yes, Mr. Sutherland,
we have them both.
And the coin.

42:07.151 --> 42:08.944
Well, yes, actually I do.
Okay.

42:09.111 --> 42:11.113
But there's no unions or benefits.

42:11.655 --> 42:12.990
That's right.

42:13.782 --> 42:15.201
What time do you land?

42:15.367 --> 42:19.121
I'll return tomorrow morning
at approximately 8:37.

42:19.288 --> 42:22.791
All right. We'll go to Great Gorge
and we'll wait for your call.

42:22.958 --> 42:25.586
But we have to leave the country
tomorrow morning.

42:25.753 --> 42:28.797
Don't worry, my dear.
Everything's arranged.

42:28.964 --> 42:32.676
All right, Mr. Sutherland.
Goodbye.

42:32.843 --> 42:35.846
Sort of like
a picky person. Ha, ha.

42:37.097 --> 42:38.641
What's it to be?

42:39.016 --> 42:43.187
I'll wait in the car.
No, meet me behind the diner.

42:44.146 --> 42:45.522
Goodbye, Mr. Lyons.

42:45.689 --> 42:49.193
I hope I bump into you again.

42:50.069 --> 42:51.779
I don't think so.

42:51.987 --> 42:54.073
See, I'll be leaving the country

42:54.323 --> 42:55.532
and you'll be dead.

42:55.741 --> 42:59.495
Dead? I thought you
weren't gonna kill us.

43:00.871 --> 43:02.873
Afraid not. Goodbye.

43:03.082 --> 43:06.168
Wait. Wait a second.
Don't we get a last request?

43:10.005 --> 43:11.632
What would you like?

43:12.841 --> 43:15.094
Would you scratch
my nose for me?

43:29.358 --> 43:31.193
You're a very sick woman.

43:31.860 --> 43:33.195
Thank you.

43:33.821 --> 43:35.322
What would you like?

43:35.531 --> 43:37.825
I suppose a fuck
is out of the question.

43:39.410 --> 43:41.245
I'm afraid so.

43:42.663 --> 43:44.123
Goodbye.

43:46.041 --> 43:47.209
Let's go, gentlemen.

43:47.376 --> 43:49.962
We don't know nothing
about no gold coin.

43:50.170 --> 43:52.047
Why do you gotta kill us?

43:52.256 --> 43:55.634
Because you're both witnesses.
I don't understand this.

43:55.801 --> 43:59.888
Why are we making it easier
for you? Why don't you just
do it here?

44:00.055 --> 44:03.392
Why in an alley?
Why don't you kill us right here?

44:04.226 --> 44:06.937
Fine.
Big mouth.

44:07.229 --> 44:10.899
Wait. We won't talk.
I promise.

44:11.108 --> 44:13.610
Please, don't do this.

44:13.819 --> 44:16.739
Dave, stop the begging, man.

44:16.947 --> 44:19.199
We gotta go out with dignity.

44:19.366 --> 44:22.411
All I want to know is
what time is it?

44:22.619 --> 44:26.832
Did you say what time is it?
Yes, I did. What time is it?

44:27.041 --> 44:28.876
Your time is up, Mr. Kerew.

44:29.043 --> 44:33.839
If I have to die, I want my friend
to tell me what time it is.

44:35.424 --> 44:36.592
Oh.

44:36.759 --> 44:38.594
What time it is?

44:41.263 --> 44:42.806
It's 3:00.

44:43.015 --> 44:45.309
Not yet. Not yet. It's 12--

44:45.517 --> 44:48.771
Wait. It's 10:00 now.
Wait, 12:00.

44:48.937 --> 44:50.647
Make up your mind!
It's 12:00.

44:50.814 --> 44:54.026
It is not 12:00. It's 11:15.
It's 12:00. It's 12:00!

44:55.444 --> 44:58.280
It's about time.
Quick! This way. This way.

44:59.948 --> 45:01.742
Careful. Narrow. Narrow.

45:02.409 --> 45:04.036
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

45:04.995 --> 45:06.622
Other way! Other way!

45:06.789 --> 45:08.916
Hurry, Wally! Hurry, Wally!
Come on, Wally!

45:09.083 --> 45:11.460
- Where we going?
- This way.

45:19.301 --> 45:20.344
What's up?

45:20.511 --> 45:24.056
Get behind this car.
There's a car.
Watch your knees.

45:24.973 --> 45:28.060
What's up?
Policemen have set up a barricade.

45:28.268 --> 45:30.437
This is running.
Anybody in it?

45:30.646 --> 45:33.649
This is a squad car.
I know that. Is anyone in it?

45:33.857 --> 45:36.193
I can't do this.
Yes, you can.

45:36.402 --> 45:38.654
My hands are cuffed.
I can't drive.

45:38.821 --> 45:42.074
Who said anything about you?
We gotta get out.

45:42.282 --> 45:45.828
We're not gonna get 10 feet.
Yes, we can. Get in.

45:48.747 --> 45:51.250
Wally, you're gonna
kill somebody.

45:51.792 --> 45:53.836
I got the wheel,
you take the pedals.

45:54.002 --> 45:57.005
You say something?
I got the wheel, you take the pedals.

45:57.214 --> 45:59.842
Oh, no! Forward!
Wally, go forward!

46:02.970 --> 46:05.305
How am I doing?
Watch the road!

46:05.514 --> 46:07.850
If it'll make you feel better.
Left!

46:08.016 --> 46:09.101
Watch out!

46:14.857 --> 46:18.610
Headquarters, this is Barricade 4!
Headquarters, this is Barricade 4!

46:18.777 --> 46:21.280
I hate when that happens.

46:29.455 --> 46:31.540
Are you stupid? You want to die?

46:31.707 --> 46:35.377
Police emergency. Out of the car.
Police? Show me your badge.

46:35.586 --> 46:36.879
This is my badge.

46:37.045 --> 46:38.964
<i>They crashed through
in a squad car.</i>

46:39.131 --> 46:40.507
Who the hell was driving?

46:40.716 --> 46:42.885
<i>I think it's the blind guy.</i>

46:44.052 --> 46:46.763
Get in the car! Open that up!
What's up?

46:47.347 --> 46:50.058
Get me down
Seventh Avenue
right away.

46:52.895 --> 46:54.563
Turn right! Turn right! Stop!

46:54.730 --> 46:57.107
Turn right! Straight ahead.

46:57.316 --> 47:00.402
Left! Right! Straight! Left! Left!

47:00.569 --> 47:02.321
Turn left! Turn left!

47:06.325 --> 47:08.327
Right. Right. To the right.

47:09.411 --> 47:12.706
We're going the wrong way
on a one-way street. A little right.

47:12.873 --> 47:15.250
- Get on the sidewalk!
- Look out!

47:20.422 --> 47:23.217
A little right. A little left.
Right. Turn right!

47:23.383 --> 47:24.760
Where are you going?

47:26.428 --> 47:28.347
These streets are bumpy.

47:30.265 --> 47:32.476
You're driving on the sidewalk!

47:37.773 --> 47:39.525
What the fuck was that?
Aah!

47:45.322 --> 47:48.617
- Go on home.
- Your mother's looking for you.

47:51.245 --> 47:53.413
Get me close.
I'm trying.

47:53.580 --> 47:55.332
Left, left. I said, left!

47:55.541 --> 47:58.710
You said right.
I said, left! A little left! A little left!

47:59.461 --> 48:02.589
Where am I?
Turn right! Right! Right!

48:02.798 --> 48:05.133
Cows! Cows! Cows!

48:11.431 --> 48:15.102
We're in a warehouse,
and you've just hit a cow.

48:15.310 --> 48:18.313
I think you better back up.

48:18.480 --> 48:20.315
Good, good, good.

48:20.691 --> 48:22.734
And stop! Stop!

48:23.110 --> 48:27.531
Go slowly to your left
and try to stay off the sidewalk.

48:27.739 --> 48:29.283
Turn right. Turn right.

48:43.171 --> 48:45.257
I just ripped my good pants.

48:47.676 --> 48:50.178
I can take the wheel now.
Slide over me.

48:53.015 --> 48:54.391
Slide over me.

48:54.850 --> 48:56.977
Wally, I can't-- Wally!

48:58.562 --> 48:59.605
Wally!

49:02.399 --> 49:04.735
I can't see. I can't see.

49:04.901 --> 49:07.362
Wally, I can't see.
I can't see either.

49:07.654 --> 49:09.364
Wally, I can't drive

49:09.531 --> 49:12.034
if you don't push the seat back.
I'm stuck.

49:12.326 --> 49:16.496
Push the seat back. Find the lever
and push the seat back.

49:17.414 --> 49:18.790
I've got it!

49:21.376 --> 49:22.586
Aah!

49:23.086 --> 49:26.131
What happened?
We had a very close call.

49:28.342 --> 49:30.469
Thank you.
Wally, I can't see.

49:33.472 --> 49:35.474
Move your hands. I can't see.
Okay.

49:37.225 --> 49:39.728
I'll get that son of a bitch now!

49:43.857 --> 49:45.567
Is there somebody
shooting at us?

49:47.611 --> 49:49.363
I didn't hear anything.

49:51.239 --> 49:52.991
Wally! Left!
My nuts!

49:57.746 --> 50:01.124
Left!
You're mashing my nuts! Ah!

50:05.587 --> 50:07.839
Brakes! Wally, put on the brakes!

50:31.071 --> 50:32.447
Where are we?

50:32.656 --> 50:35.242
I think we're floating
towards New Jersey.

50:35.450 --> 50:39.871
No shit. I got relatives in Jersey.
How nice for you.

50:40.914 --> 50:43.291
You could read her lips, right?

50:43.458 --> 50:45.544
Yes, I could.
What did she say?

50:45.752 --> 50:48.130
She said,
"I'll give it to you tomorrow.

50:48.296 --> 50:52.592
We'll go to Grace George in the
morning and wait for your call."

50:52.801 --> 50:56.513
Then she said,
"We have to leave
the country tomorrow."

50:56.680 --> 50:57.723
Okay.

50:57.889 --> 51:01.893
We have to find this Grace George
and wait for them to show up.

51:02.060 --> 51:03.603
Are you with me?

51:04.479 --> 51:07.357
Am I with you? Of course.

51:07.649 --> 51:09.568
You've earned my trust, Wally.

51:10.569 --> 51:12.904
You're always
watching out for me.

51:13.071 --> 51:15.490
And you never get me
into trouble.

51:16.283 --> 51:19.995
Sometimes life is
a little boring with you,

51:20.954 --> 51:24.833
but that's a small price to pay
for such a wonderful friendship.

51:25.751 --> 51:28.003
That's a sweet thing you just said.

51:29.463 --> 51:31.798
Do you mean everything
you just said?

51:32.174 --> 51:37.053
I'll tell you exactly how I feel
in just a minute or two.

51:39.556 --> 51:42.184
Right now
I'm a little overwhelmed...

51:43.602 --> 51:48.023
by the stink of the
7000 tons of garbage

51:48.231 --> 51:50.567
that you drove me into!

51:50.776 --> 51:52.694
Is that what it is?

51:52.903 --> 51:54.863
I thought you let one go.

51:55.030 --> 51:57.699
That's why I didn't say nothing.

51:58.867 --> 52:01.661
That was kind of you.
Thank you.

52:01.828 --> 52:05.499
<i>2286, this is Dispatch.
What is your location?</i>

52:06.291 --> 52:08.627
<i>2286, please respond. Over.</i>

52:09.878 --> 52:12.547
Can you please hurry?
We have to bury the car.

52:12.714 --> 52:13.715
Oy! Ah!

52:14.382 --> 52:17.719
Je-- Jesus!
Be careful, will you?

52:17.886 --> 52:19.721
Take it easy. Take it easy.

52:19.930 --> 52:23.642
I'm doing damn good for a blind man.
What'd you say?

52:23.809 --> 52:26.853
I said, I'm doing damn good for a--

52:27.062 --> 52:30.023
You know what,
I'm getting tired of this deaf shit.

52:30.232 --> 52:34.736
You can't hear anything I say,
even if I scream in your ear?

52:35.570 --> 52:39.032
I don't know. I've never tried it.
Really?

52:39.741 --> 52:44.704
No. It seems crazy,
after all these years,
but I've never done that before.

52:44.913 --> 52:47.415
I would like you to.
Go ahead, Wally.

52:47.582 --> 52:51.378
I want you to.
Let's give it a try.

52:54.005 --> 52:55.340
Dave?

52:56.132 --> 52:58.510
I want you to listen to me.

52:59.427 --> 53:03.390
I'm going to try.
Open up them pores, okay?

53:03.598 --> 53:07.227
Be responsive to
what I'm going to say.

53:07.435 --> 53:11.398
I want you to hear me. Okay?!

53:11.606 --> 53:13.108
Shazam!

53:13.275 --> 53:16.069
Can you hear me?!

53:16.444 --> 53:17.612
Oh!

53:18.947 --> 53:20.198
What?!

53:20.448 --> 53:21.950
Wally!
What?

53:22.117 --> 53:24.119
Wally!
What?

53:24.286 --> 53:26.997
Jesus! I heard something!
Yes!

53:27.163 --> 53:28.957
I heard your voice!

53:29.165 --> 53:32.794
You heard me?
Wally, I heard your voice!

53:32.961 --> 53:35.380
You can hear me, Dave!
What?

53:35.589 --> 53:37.716
You can hear me!

53:37.924 --> 53:41.845
No, schmuck! I'm deaf!

53:42.053 --> 53:43.972
Now do you get it?!

53:51.646 --> 53:55.734
- I'm not a crybaby.
- Hmph! You are a crybaby.

53:55.942 --> 53:57.319
Well, guess what you are.

53:57.485 --> 54:02.115
A blind, egotistical asshole
who denies he can't see shit.

54:02.282 --> 54:06.036
Denies? You're the one
who denies! This is you, right?

54:06.244 --> 54:10.999
"I'm not deaf. I can read lips.
Don't call me a deaf person."

54:11.166 --> 54:14.336
Well, fuck it. I'm blind!
You hear me?

54:14.502 --> 54:18.506
Because some asshole
drunk-drived me into a fire hydrant

54:18.673 --> 54:20.258
and I'm blind for life.

54:20.425 --> 54:23.053
He gets six months'
suspended sentence.

54:23.261 --> 54:27.265
But fuck it. I'm not gonna
worry about him. Fuck him.

54:27.432 --> 54:30.518
You swear a lot.
You're fucking-A right!

54:30.685 --> 54:34.856
Fucking-A!
Something bothers you, fuck it.
Your wife leaves you, fuck her.

54:35.065 --> 54:39.861
Boss fires you, fuck him.
Hey, fuck it. Fuck them.
Fuck it, right?

54:40.070 --> 54:42.364
You're fucking right!
That's right.

54:42.572 --> 54:48.036
You know that it's a blessing
to be able to do that?
You're a lucky guy. I can't do it.

54:48.203 --> 54:50.205
Well, fucking change!

54:50.956 --> 54:52.040
Fuck.

54:53.124 --> 54:55.293
Easy for you to say.

54:55.502 --> 54:59.214
It's not easy for me to say.
I'm blind.

54:59.381 --> 55:03.385
You're blind. But when
you walk down the street,
people want to touch you.

55:03.551 --> 55:07.138
When you're deaf,
they don't wanna.
They might catch something.

55:07.347 --> 55:10.892
Like you're some kind of leper.
We're being bitter, aren't we?

55:11.059 --> 55:13.269
I accept what I can do
and what I can't do.

55:13.478 --> 55:16.648
I don't think running around
catching vicious, scum killers

55:16.856 --> 55:21.069
is something you and I are
the best-equipped people
in the world at doing.

55:21.236 --> 55:23.071
Bullshit! You're an actor.

55:23.279 --> 55:27.242
If you don't tell anyone you're deaf
or I'm blind, we can do anything.

55:27.409 --> 55:29.828
I guarantee it.
You guarantee it?

55:30.036 --> 55:33.999
Right. And if you won't help me,
I'll do it fucking alone,

55:34.165 --> 55:37.002
because I don't need you
or anyone else!

55:37.669 --> 55:41.339
Well, okay.
Well, now I get the point.

55:41.548 --> 55:44.175
<i>Excusez-moi, Monsieur</i> Hot-Shit.

55:44.342 --> 55:49.014
I'll just go have a nice hot bath
and a cocktail before dinner.

55:49.180 --> 55:52.434
Wait, Dave.
We ought to cool out a little bit.

55:52.600 --> 55:55.770
Have a nice day.
Just keep our heads.

55:55.979 --> 56:00.442
I figure me and you,
we know a lot. Dave! Ah!

56:00.608 --> 56:05.905
Goddamn it! Dave! Dave!
How in the fuck do you expect
me to get out of this shit?!

56:07.323 --> 56:08.533
Dave!

56:08.950 --> 56:14.122
Shit's cold! Come back!
We have to bury the car!

56:16.499 --> 56:20.795
There are steps coming up.
Three steps. And, one.

56:26.051 --> 56:27.427
Oh, no.

56:27.635 --> 56:32.390
Back, back. Back, Wally.
And turn. And one, two, three.

56:32.599 --> 56:37.312
And turn. Very good.
That's lovely. And go.
And we go.

56:37.479 --> 56:39.481
<i>Yes, sir, our losers will get...</i>

56:43.026 --> 56:44.069
Hello?

56:44.235 --> 56:46.154
<i>Collect call from Earvin Johnson.</i>

56:46.321 --> 56:48.656
<i>Will you accept the charges?</i>
Yes, operator.

56:48.823 --> 56:52.494
Hi, guess who.
Just tell me you're all right.

56:52.660 --> 56:56.414
I'm great.
I wish you were here with your car.

56:56.581 --> 57:01.336
<i>You could bring lots of money,</i>
<i>a couple of beers if possible,</i>
<i>probably cold.</i>

57:01.544 --> 57:05.590
<i>I need a racing form and binoculars.</i>
Where are you?

57:05.757 --> 57:08.176
A little motel on the interstate,

57:08.384 --> 57:11.596
about five miles west
of the George Washington.

57:29.823 --> 57:31.699
Headquarters, this is Steely. Over.

57:37.455 --> 57:39.874
She's going into Room 18.

57:46.673 --> 57:48.633
Now. Now.

58:28.173 --> 58:30.717
That's a hell of a place to park.

58:33.720 --> 58:35.597
She's checked into Room 18.
Where?

58:35.763 --> 58:37.473
Over here. Right here.

58:38.349 --> 58:39.934
Let me have that.

58:41.436 --> 58:45.565
This is the police.
You are surrounded.

58:45.773 --> 58:51.112
All right, jokers, you got 10 seconds
to come out with your hands up.

58:51.279 --> 58:52.780
Ten,

58:52.989 --> 58:54.490
nine,

58:54.699 --> 58:56.117
eight,

58:56.284 --> 58:57.410
seven...

58:59.662 --> 59:00.830
six...

59:02.457 --> 59:04.584
- She said she was 18.
- Five...

59:06.669 --> 59:11.007
four, three...
The county is really cracking down.

59:11.216 --> 59:12.467
Two,

59:12.675 --> 59:13.927
one.

59:18.514 --> 59:20.516
All right, let's go!

59:33.488 --> 59:34.489
Ah.

59:41.621 --> 59:45.667
Goddamn them. Goddamn them.
Take it easy, we'll find them.

59:45.833 --> 59:49.545
Search the entire area.
They gotta be around here
someplace.

59:49.754 --> 59:54.217
For chrissakes, how far could
they get? An all-cars alert!

59:54.425 --> 59:57.387
Sergeant Keller, I need
every man you can spare

59:57.595 --> 01:00:00.515
to surround the area
and comb the hills.

01:00:00.723 --> 01:00:03.142
Damn those guys.

01:00:03.768 --> 01:00:06.521
I'll get them.
I'm gonna get them.

01:00:06.688 --> 01:00:08.356
We gotta cover every road.

01:00:08.523 --> 01:00:12.902
Your men have to be aware that this
is a number-one-priority manhunt.

01:00:18.032 --> 01:00:23.371
Dave, meet my sister,
Adele. Adele, this is
my dear friend, David.

01:00:23.538 --> 01:00:25.498
How do you do?
How do you do?

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:36.050
There she is. Careful, your knees.

01:00:39.137 --> 01:00:44.017
- First thing we do is find a phone book.
- Look up this lady, "Grace George."

01:00:44.183 --> 01:00:49.022
Then we get the coin,
they come look for us
and we wait with the police.

01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:52.900
There can't be many Grace Georges.
You mean the resort?

01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:56.112
No, the person they're
giving the coin to.

01:00:56.321 --> 01:00:59.741
Great Gorge is a big resort
in Vernon Valley.

01:00:59.907 --> 01:01:03.161
How do you know that?
I almost got married there.

01:01:03.369 --> 01:01:06.080
I think David got things
a little mixed up.

01:01:06.664 --> 01:01:07.832
What did she say?

01:01:08.041 --> 01:01:11.085
She said she thinks
you're an asshole!

01:01:19.886 --> 01:01:23.765
I'm sorry, sir. We're fully booked.
You gotta have something.

01:01:23.973 --> 01:01:29.312
I'm sorry, we're booked.
Everything is taken by
the medical convention.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:32.774
We have people coming here
from all over the world.

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:34.108
I don't have anything.

01:01:34.275 --> 01:01:37.278
What about cancellations?
She doesn't have any rooms?

01:01:37.445 --> 01:01:40.531
I don't wanna take
my wife to a motel.

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:43.659
We're supposed to hold these
till midnight.

01:01:44.869 --> 01:01:48.664
I have a couple from London,
a doctor from Sweden

01:01:48.831 --> 01:01:52.627
and a doctor from Germany
who still haven't arrived.

01:01:53.586 --> 01:01:57.673
Tell you what,
if none of these people
show up by 10:00,

01:01:57.924 --> 01:02:01.594
I'll let their rooms go.
But you have to wait till 10.

01:02:01.761 --> 01:02:05.807
All right. Thank you.
Can we go to the bar?

01:02:05.973 --> 01:02:07.558
Yes, of course.

01:02:07.767 --> 01:02:09.644
Sorry I couldn't help you.

01:02:12.438 --> 01:02:16.317
Hi, I'm blind. Could you show me
where the ladies' room is?

01:02:16.526 --> 01:02:18.653
Oh, sure, it's right over--

01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:21.155
Oh, pfft, sorry.
I'll show you.

01:02:21.364 --> 01:02:26.494
Give me your hand. No, wait.
The other one. Here we go.

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.497
Thank you so much.

01:02:35.211 --> 01:02:37.713
You're Dr. Johannson
from Sweden.

01:02:37.922 --> 01:02:40.091
Johannson from Sweden.

01:02:42.176 --> 01:02:45.138
I'm from Sweden.
Can I help you, gentlemen?

01:02:45.346 --> 01:02:47.348
I'm from Sweden.

01:02:47.515 --> 01:02:52.353
Oh. You must be Dr. Johannson.
Yo, Johannson from Sweden.

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:54.689
I'm a Swede,
and you're a sweetie.

01:02:56.065 --> 01:02:58.776
Thank you.
Uh... And you must be?

01:02:58.943 --> 01:03:00.945
I'm Dr. Kesselbaum.

01:03:01.154 --> 01:03:02.780
Uh, you mean Kesselring?

01:03:02.989 --> 01:03:06.534
Kesselring! Right. Heh, heh.
I forget my own name next.

01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:12.623
You are one of the most
beautiful women I've ever seen.

01:03:12.832 --> 01:03:16.836
There you are.
You move so fast,
like a little hummingbird. Just:

01:03:18.504 --> 01:03:21.883
You're a little sneaker.
You got wings like Mercury.

01:03:22.049 --> 01:03:26.596
You're such a nice--
Oh! There he is again.
You're gonna rub it off.

01:03:26.804 --> 01:03:29.140
A little lunch you had left over.
Heh-heh-heh.

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:30.683
Here you are.

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:38.149
We thought you might not make it.
You had trouble with your visa?

01:03:38.357 --> 01:03:42.111
Then suddenly they accepted
American Express. Go figure!

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:45.448
We don't go home without it,
I'll tell you that.

01:03:45.907 --> 01:03:47.200
Oh...

01:03:47.867 --> 01:03:50.328
Uh, here, why don't you
fill these out?

01:03:50.495 --> 01:03:51.996
Thank you.

01:03:54.290 --> 01:03:58.252
Here you are, doctor.
I got mine and you got yours.

01:03:58.503 --> 01:04:02.590
We're out of double rooms.
I saved you a suite with two queens.

01:04:02.757 --> 01:04:07.136
Well, get them fellas out of there!
We want to get some sleep.
Right, doctor?

01:04:08.971 --> 01:04:11.015
Here we go. Here's your key.

01:04:11.557 --> 01:04:16.896
Thank you. Come, doctor,
we gotta get some sleep now.
Make some Z's.

01:04:17.104 --> 01:04:20.066
I hope you don't snore.
I'll send you back to Germany.

01:04:20.274 --> 01:04:22.777
That's better than Philadelphia.

01:04:29.283 --> 01:04:31.619
Good thing the girl
remembered the sister.

01:04:31.786 --> 01:04:34.747
Put out an APB
on that convertible.

01:04:34.956 --> 01:04:38.292
Where can they be?
They couldn't have gotten far.

01:04:38.501 --> 01:04:41.003
Who knows with these guys?
Eh.

01:04:41.546 --> 01:04:44.966
I'm telling you,
these guys are getting to me.

01:04:45.174 --> 01:04:47.134
Take it easy, Emile.
Take it easy.

01:04:47.301 --> 01:04:49.428
Don't those state cops
have anything?

01:04:49.637 --> 01:04:53.391
Jesus, I have 28 years on
the force, a wife and five kids.

01:04:53.599 --> 01:04:56.978
A blind guy and a deaf guy
are making me look
like an asshole.

01:04:57.186 --> 01:04:59.105
Now, that's the truth.
Huh?

01:04:59.272 --> 01:05:00.314
Sam 1, over.

01:05:04.151 --> 01:05:05.403
I think it's them.

01:05:06.946 --> 01:05:08.948
Nuts!
What is it?

01:05:09.615 --> 01:05:11.993
They just went behind some trees.

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:15.788
There, there! Yes, it's them.

01:05:15.955 --> 01:05:17.665
They're going into the building.

01:05:35.683 --> 01:05:39.145
- Tell him to hurry. This isn't easy.
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:05:39.312 --> 01:05:41.814
Hold it steady.
This isn't easy.

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:02.168
I know where the coin is,
but he's in the room. Get him out.

01:06:02.335 --> 01:06:05.504
I'll get him out of there.
You just get the coin.

01:06:05.671 --> 01:06:10.009
Adele, wait! I need some money.
I might have to buy somebody.

01:06:10.176 --> 01:06:11.385
Whoa. Whoa!

01:06:12.762 --> 01:06:14.472
You all right, Dave?

01:06:22.063 --> 01:06:24.023
Oh. Trouble.

01:06:25.566 --> 01:06:27.485
Hey, give me Room 49, please.
Hurry.

01:06:28.861 --> 01:06:30.154
Yes.

01:06:31.072 --> 01:06:32.531
What?

01:06:32.698 --> 01:06:36.911
I told him I had enough trouble
with two-wheel drive. I hate this.

01:06:37.078 --> 01:06:40.539
All right,
it's not the end of the world,
it's just an accident.

01:06:40.706 --> 01:06:44.377
You're damaged, I'm damaged.
Remove your car from my bumper--

01:06:44.585 --> 01:06:47.213
No, he'll kill me.
My husband is an insurance man.

01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:49.590
Can you imagine
if I didn't file a claim?

01:06:49.799 --> 01:06:52.343
That's not my problem.
I'm in a hurry.

01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:58.015
Wait a minute. I got my card here.
Don't get excited. I know I have it.

01:07:01.102 --> 01:07:03.062
Oh.
Oops.

01:07:03.771 --> 01:07:08.734
Thank you for helping me.
That's okay. That's why we're here.

01:07:10.611 --> 01:07:14.073
I must have left my keys
on the dining-room table.

01:07:14.281 --> 01:07:17.118
Want me to wait?
No, no, no. I've gotta go to bed.

01:07:17.326 --> 01:07:19.745
I had a humungous breakfast.
Made me tired.

01:07:19.954 --> 01:07:24.667
I got three postcards
and I registered for the bingo.
That's a lot for one day.

01:07:24.834 --> 01:07:29.338
Well, you take care of yourself.
You too. Bye-bye.

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:35.136
I'm right here.
Good.

01:07:35.302 --> 01:07:38.305
You'll warn me if anyone comes?
I'll yell my head off.

01:07:38.472 --> 01:07:41.058
Nobody's gonna come.
Just get the coin.

01:08:00.494 --> 01:08:04.290
- You sure you put him in 357?
- Maybe he switched rooms.

01:08:04.457 --> 01:08:06.500
No. It's not possible.
Oh, shit.

01:08:06.667 --> 01:08:08.919
There are no other rooms,
Dr. Cornfeld.

01:08:09.086 --> 01:08:11.839
I have nothing to switch to.
Oh, there he is!

01:08:12.006 --> 01:08:15.551
Dr. Johannson! Dr. Johannson!
Dr. Johannson! Dr. Johannson!

01:08:15.718 --> 01:08:19.054
You! Where have
you been, doctor?
I've come to pick you up.

01:08:19.263 --> 01:08:22.475
Well, I'm a little bit too heavy
for that, my dear.

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:27.354
Did you get lost, Dr. Johannson?
"Yo-hannson." How soon we forget.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:31.901
The seminar's beginning.
We don't want to start
without the main performer.

01:08:32.067 --> 01:08:35.362
Great. I'll wait here for him.
When he comes, I'll be down--

01:08:35.529 --> 01:08:38.866
Always joking.
I had no idea you
were this much fun.

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:34.212
Ugh.

01:09:57.361 --> 01:09:58.696
Ah.

01:10:05.244 --> 01:10:06.579
Kirgo?

01:10:07.288 --> 01:10:12.376
I'd like to introduce our panel,
four eminent specialists
in their field:

01:10:12.585 --> 01:10:15.296
Dr. Saul Jenner, cardiology.

01:10:15.462 --> 01:10:19.133
Dr. Harold Orlow, pathology.

01:10:19.341 --> 01:10:22.636
Dr. Rita Bennett, ophthalmology.

01:10:22.845 --> 01:10:25.097
And in his first visit to the U.S.,

01:10:25.306 --> 01:10:30.644
the eminent Swedish gynecologist,
Dr. Conrad Johannson.

01:10:30.936 --> 01:10:32.146
Yo.

01:10:50.247 --> 01:10:51.832
Hold it right there.

01:10:52.958 --> 01:10:56.211
Get away from that table
or I'll blow your brains out.

01:10:57.588 --> 01:10:58.672
Move! Move!

01:11:04.511 --> 01:11:05.679
All right, get them up.

01:11:08.098 --> 01:11:11.060
Come on. Hands over your head.

01:11:12.311 --> 01:11:14.897
Both! Both of them!

01:11:37.169 --> 01:11:38.462
You're good.

01:11:39.296 --> 01:11:41.340
You're real good.

01:11:55.521 --> 01:11:59.650
This is the best relationship
I've had with a woman in eight years.

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:19.336
So long, sweetheart.
Another time,

01:12:19.503 --> 01:12:22.840
another place,
we might've had a chance.

01:12:23.257 --> 01:12:25.259
You will write, won't you?

01:12:28.053 --> 01:12:30.931
Dr. Johannson,
my question is for you.

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:35.978
In your paper
on multiple orgasms
in geriatric women,

01:12:36.186 --> 01:12:39.273
you attribute increased
sexual appetite

01:12:39.481 --> 01:12:42.443
to a lactose-restricted diet.

01:12:42.609 --> 01:12:46.989
Now, I know you're modest,
but I really must insist
on pinning you down here.

01:12:47.156 --> 01:12:51.577
Doctor, which exercise would
you find most beneficial

01:12:51.744 --> 01:12:53.579
to geriatric sexuality?

01:12:56.123 --> 01:12:57.666
Oh, boy.

01:12:58.250 --> 01:13:01.462
Well, some of my patients
prefer walking.

01:13:01.837 --> 01:13:04.089
Some prefer bicycling.

01:13:04.256 --> 01:13:09.428
But for your best results,
to guarantee satisfaction,

01:13:09.636 --> 01:13:11.805
most of them like fucking.

01:13:12.639 --> 01:13:15.309
You know, punta, punta, punta.

01:13:15.809 --> 01:13:20.564
I like it myself.
One in the morning and late at night.

01:13:20.731 --> 01:13:24.151
Put everything back
in your purse and you can
move your vehicle.

01:13:24.318 --> 01:13:28.072
But if he leaves me, what is gonna
happen to me and the twins?

01:13:28.489 --> 01:13:32.534
I don't know anybody.
People never treat me
as nicely as you do.

01:13:32.743 --> 01:13:36.080
I've been extremely rude.
I'm just gonna leave you now.

01:13:36.246 --> 01:13:38.457
No, move your car.
Get out of your way.

01:13:38.665 --> 01:13:41.085
- It's against my car. Look--
- Kirgo.

01:13:41.251 --> 01:13:42.920
Where the hell were you?

01:13:44.171 --> 01:13:48.425
Sorry, there was an accident.
This woman rammed
into our Spider.

01:13:48.592 --> 01:13:52.179
It was all very simple
till she made it very complicated.

01:14:00.687 --> 01:14:01.855
Hm.

01:14:02.022 --> 01:14:06.860
But why can't you give me numbers?
Why are you being so evasive?

01:14:08.654 --> 01:14:10.030
Oh!

01:14:10.531 --> 01:14:12.533
- What is it?
- What's wrong?

01:14:12.699 --> 01:14:18.038
Shooting pains in my head.
My eyes! Oh, boy, it's a bummer!

01:14:18.205 --> 01:14:22.459
I can't see. Take me to my room.
Let me have a look.

01:14:22.668 --> 01:14:27.881
Look at what? Don't look!
Get your hands off of me!

01:14:28.048 --> 01:14:31.552
Stop acting like a baby.
I'm a doctor.
Let me have a peek.

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:35.389
Don't touch that head!

01:14:35.556 --> 01:14:38.725
Whatever you do,
don't you touch it.

01:14:39.309 --> 01:14:41.562
Who are you, sir?
Fine, thank you.

01:14:41.728 --> 01:14:45.399
Now just relax.
Everything's gonna be
all right. I'm right here.

01:14:45.566 --> 01:14:47.901
Oh, my goodness.
I thought you'd never come.

01:14:48.068 --> 01:14:49.444
Do you know what's wrong?

01:14:49.653 --> 01:14:54.366
Of course I know what's
happened. This is called
"Blindness Hystericus."

01:14:54.575 --> 01:14:58.662
Oh, my God.
Sometimes it comes just like that.

01:14:58.829 --> 01:15:00.164
How do you treat it?

01:15:00.330 --> 01:15:03.667
The left and right brain
are having a fight with each other.

01:15:03.834 --> 01:15:05.919
You gotta distract them
for a minute.

01:15:06.086 --> 01:15:08.714
Now, Dr. Johannson,

01:15:09.006 --> 01:15:12.885
how many fingers am I holding up
in front of your eyes right now?

01:15:13.093 --> 01:15:15.137
Three!
Good.

01:15:15.345 --> 01:15:18.098
That's pretty good,
considering that he's blind.

01:15:18.307 --> 01:15:22.060
Now, doctor, I want you
to just relax. Take it easy,

01:15:22.269 --> 01:15:26.940
and you tell me the first thing
that pops into your brain.

01:15:27.524 --> 01:15:28.609
Pussy.

01:15:29.276 --> 01:15:32.738
It's amazing!
This man is cured.
Come on, doctor.

01:15:32.905 --> 01:15:35.157
We gotta take a walk,
get the heart pumping.

01:15:35.324 --> 01:15:38.285
And then it's gonna
be all brand-new.
Come on, doctor.

01:15:38.994 --> 01:15:40.162
That's it. Easy.

01:15:40.329 --> 01:15:41.788
Where's Adele?

01:15:41.955 --> 01:15:44.416
I don't know.
She's not in the room.

01:15:44.583 --> 01:15:47.628
See, if he gets too excited,
it comes right back.

01:15:47.836 --> 01:15:51.715
Gently. Take it easy, doctor.
This guy's blind as a bat.

01:15:51.924 --> 01:15:55.135
Oh! Watch your step.
What's the matter with you?

01:15:59.765 --> 01:16:01.934
You got a Lyons and Kerew
registered here?

01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:04.436
- I'll check, sir.
- I'm sorry, we have no one--

01:16:04.645 --> 01:16:08.482
One guy's blind, the other's deaf.
I'm sure. I just checked.

01:16:08.649 --> 01:16:11.652
If I brought in some pictures,
could you identify them?

01:16:11.818 --> 01:16:12.819
I'll try.

01:16:12.986 --> 01:16:14.863
Do you have a security officer?

01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:16.156
Right behind you.

01:16:16.865 --> 01:16:18.992
Single file. Single file.

01:16:19.618 --> 01:16:22.329
Okay, take it easy. Take it easy.

01:16:24.706 --> 01:16:27.918
Excuse me.
Where's the little red Alfa?

01:16:28.126 --> 01:16:29.962
They just took off.
Who?

01:16:30.170 --> 01:16:32.965
Three of them.
A lady with great legs,

01:16:33.173 --> 01:16:36.343
an English guy
and a black woman.

01:16:37.135 --> 01:16:40.097
My God. My sister.

01:16:44.142 --> 01:16:49.398
Hey, um, the man,
he asked me to give this to you.

01:16:55.821 --> 01:16:57.489
"If you wanna see the girl,

01:16:57.656 --> 01:17:00.784
bring the coin to the house
with a thousand windows."
Route 104.

01:17:00.993 --> 01:17:04.705
Is this a joke?
No, that's the Sutherland Estate.

01:17:04.871 --> 01:17:09.209
I hope you have an invitation.
Heh-heh-heh. He's got some
mean dogs up there.

01:17:09.376 --> 01:17:12.170
Dogs?
Yeah, Dobermans. They're killers.

01:17:12.379 --> 01:17:15.257
Do you have our keys with you?
Yeah.

01:17:16.049 --> 01:17:18.302
Would you do me a favor?
Sure.

01:17:18.510 --> 01:17:21.847
If we're not back in 30, call the police.
Police?

01:17:22.014 --> 01:17:25.726
New York Police Department.
Ask for Captain Braddock.

01:17:25.934 --> 01:17:28.645
And tell him-- Sorry, Wally.

01:17:28.854 --> 01:17:33.025
Tell him Lyons and Kerew
are at the Sutherland Estate.

01:17:35.068 --> 01:17:39.031
The house is all glass,
and it's on huge rocks.

01:17:40.449 --> 01:17:43.577
- My sister?
- Nothing yet, Wally.

01:17:46.997 --> 01:17:49.249
There's a lot of land here.

01:17:52.794 --> 01:17:54.212
- There.
- What?

01:17:54.421 --> 01:17:56.840
- It's a greenhouse.
- There she is, Wally.

01:17:57.049 --> 01:17:59.426
- Is she all right?
- I think so.

01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:05.265
And there are the dogs.
Three of them.

01:18:05.474 --> 01:18:07.184
Now they're leaving.

01:18:08.268 --> 01:18:11.438
They're going.
Looks like they're locking the door.

01:18:13.732 --> 01:18:16.276
Now they're going back
to the main house.

01:18:16.777 --> 01:18:19.488
She's gonna be all alone
in about two minutes.

01:18:21.281 --> 01:18:24.117
You all clear on the plan?
Clear as a bell.

01:18:24.284 --> 01:18:27.329
I'm gonna go water the plants,
if you don't mind.

01:18:31.124 --> 01:18:33.543
Hey, you sure there's
only three dogs?

01:18:33.752 --> 01:18:35.545
I better take a look.

01:18:37.798 --> 01:18:40.467
<i>The parking brake
has been released.</i>

01:18:40.634 --> 01:18:44.513
Yeah, just the three of them.
I don't see what could go wrong.

01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:50.644
You hear that, Dave?
Better check the brake!

01:18:50.977 --> 01:18:53.313
Whoa! Wally!

01:18:54.689 --> 01:18:55.857
Dave?

01:18:56.024 --> 01:18:57.651
Wally, I'm in trouble!

01:18:57.818 --> 01:18:59.236
Pull out, Dave!

01:18:59.945 --> 01:19:01.947
<i>The parking brake
has been released.</i>

01:19:02.406 --> 01:19:03.657
Where are you, Dave?

01:19:03.824 --> 01:19:05.992
Ah! Whoa! Whoa!

01:19:06.159 --> 01:19:07.828
Dave, I can't--

01:19:08.662 --> 01:19:10.747
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:19:11.832 --> 01:19:13.250
<i>The parking brake has--</i>

01:19:13.417 --> 01:19:14.835
Dave.

01:19:16.169 --> 01:19:17.671
Dave?

01:19:17.838 --> 01:19:19.589
Talk to me, Dave.

01:19:21.216 --> 01:19:22.551
Dave!

01:19:22.717 --> 01:19:24.636
<i>The parking brake
has been released.</i>

01:19:24.803 --> 01:19:26.138
Dave! Speak to me!

01:19:27.013 --> 01:19:28.348
Dave!

01:19:30.684 --> 01:19:32.269
Dave! Talk to me!

01:19:32.436 --> 01:19:33.728
<i>The parking brake...</i>

01:19:33.895 --> 01:19:37.691
Talk to me, Dave!
I can hear the car,
but I can't hear you!

01:19:37.858 --> 01:19:39.609
I can't see you, Dave. Unh!

01:19:40.026 --> 01:19:41.486
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:19:43.697 --> 01:19:46.700
Dave? Dave!

01:19:47.659 --> 01:19:51.037
Oh, Dave. My God, Dave,
what have I done this time?

01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:53.206
Dave?

01:19:53.707 --> 01:19:56.042
Oh, shit! Dave!

01:19:56.209 --> 01:19:57.544
Oh!

01:19:58.044 --> 01:20:00.255
My God, Dave.

01:20:04.843 --> 01:20:07.304
Dave, you say something?
Talk to me.

01:20:08.555 --> 01:20:12.058
I can't see your lips.
What are you saying?

01:20:12.225 --> 01:20:14.561
Dave, can you see them now?

01:20:15.228 --> 01:20:16.563
Yeah.

01:20:16.897 --> 01:20:19.191
Heh. There you are.

01:20:20.317 --> 01:20:22.068
What are you saying?

01:20:22.819 --> 01:20:24.529
I'm saying...

01:20:25.071 --> 01:20:27.407
I think it's over.

01:20:29.075 --> 01:20:31.578
I didn't just
fuck my life up today.

01:20:31.745 --> 01:20:37.000
I dragged my sister into this shit.
Damn near got her killed.

01:20:38.835 --> 01:20:40.670
And I hurt you.

01:20:42.047 --> 01:20:44.090
I just want to say I'm sorry, Dave.

01:20:45.091 --> 01:20:47.010
Don't back out on me, Willy.

01:20:47.177 --> 01:20:50.931
Dave, I've been running on fumes
most of my life.

01:20:51.097 --> 01:20:55.769
And today I realized for the first time:
I'm full of shit.

01:20:56.144 --> 01:20:58.021
Well, that's true.

01:20:58.855 --> 01:21:00.065
But this morning,

01:21:00.232 --> 01:21:04.277
I threatened to shoot
a naked woman with my erection.

01:21:04.444 --> 01:21:07.197
Now, that doesn't happen every day.

01:21:07.739 --> 01:21:11.284
That's true.
The man's got a point.

01:21:12.035 --> 01:21:15.789
We'll get her out, Wally.
We'll get her out.

01:21:16.164 --> 01:21:18.041
I think we're in over our heads.

01:21:18.208 --> 01:21:21.461
Nobody ever thought
we would get this far.

01:21:22.295 --> 01:21:24.130
Don't back out on me now.

01:21:28.635 --> 01:21:31.805
I can't.
You can.

01:21:32.264 --> 01:21:35.976
We can, I promise. We can.

01:21:38.395 --> 01:21:39.479
What if we can't?

01:21:43.233 --> 01:21:44.317
Fuck it.

01:21:46.319 --> 01:21:50.073
Damn you.
I created a monster.

01:21:52.492 --> 01:21:53.910
Where's the girl?

01:21:54.119 --> 01:21:56.663
In the greenhouse
where they can see her.

01:21:56.830 --> 01:21:57.998
Good.

01:21:58.415 --> 01:22:01.585
And when can we expect
our two distinguished guests?

01:22:01.793 --> 01:22:03.878
They should be arriving
at any moment.

01:22:04.045 --> 01:22:05.755
Do they...

01:22:05.922 --> 01:22:08.008
have the coin?

01:22:09.259 --> 01:22:11.219
Yes, they have the coin.

01:22:11.428 --> 01:22:13.430
Wonderful.

01:22:18.852 --> 01:22:22.522
What do you think of that?
Lot of trouble over a piece of gold.

01:22:22.689 --> 01:22:27.444
I don't know what this is,
but it's not gold. Gold doesn't
chip and peel like this.

01:22:27.611 --> 01:22:30.530
Doesn't matter,
as long as they
want it real bad.

01:22:30.739 --> 01:22:33.450
Hold on to it in case
anything happens to me.

01:22:33.658 --> 01:22:36.995
Nothing's gonna happen to you.
Good. Glad to find that out.

01:22:37.203 --> 01:22:38.496
Ready?
Ready.

01:22:44.669 --> 01:22:45.920
Okay, Wally.

01:22:46.463 --> 01:22:48.048
Start counting.

01:22:49.090 --> 01:22:50.216
One...

01:22:51.718 --> 01:22:54.054
two, three,

01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:56.681
four, five...

01:23:05.231 --> 01:23:07.233
--sixteen, seventeen...

01:23:51.653 --> 01:23:55.323
There's a dog. There's a dog!
There's a dog!

01:23:55.490 --> 01:23:56.533
Oh!

01:23:59.577 --> 01:24:00.620
Ha!

01:24:00.829 --> 01:24:02.288
Mmm.

01:24:05.125 --> 01:24:06.459
Hey!

01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:12.298
No, Dave, no. There's an alarm!
There's an alarm. No, no, no.

01:24:12.465 --> 01:24:13.633
No, Dave!

01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:24.602
Shh.

01:24:28.064 --> 01:24:29.649
So far, so good.

01:24:34.988 --> 01:24:37.699
Almost. There.

01:24:43.246 --> 01:24:46.374
Now, what's all the fuss about?

01:24:46.833 --> 01:24:51.171
Well, I was gonna mention the alarm,
but something else came up.

01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:08.021
Who is it?
I was so hoping you'd show up.

01:25:08.688 --> 01:25:10.648
Oh, sorry about the flowers.

01:25:10.857 --> 01:25:12.066
You like roses, huh?

01:25:14.527 --> 01:25:18.698
That's enough, Herman.
It's all right. Just keep
your gun pointed on him.

01:25:18.907 --> 01:25:20.950
I'll check if he has the coin.

01:25:21.743 --> 01:25:24.871
Hands over your head,
Mr. Lyons. Remember?

01:25:25.371 --> 01:25:26.873
Turn around.

01:25:28.708 --> 01:25:32.378
Careful. You remember
what happened last time.

01:25:48.561 --> 01:25:49.604
Ah!

01:25:51.231 --> 01:25:53.817
Hit her! Hit her, Dave!
Smack her!

01:25:53.983 --> 01:25:57.195
Hit her!
Hit her, Dave! What's--?

01:25:57.362 --> 01:25:58.863
Hit her!

01:26:00.031 --> 01:26:01.407
Jesus!

01:26:01.574 --> 01:26:03.743
I grew up with brothers.
Let's get out of here.

01:26:06.079 --> 01:26:08.164
Back up.
You have to run up that log.

01:26:08.331 --> 01:26:10.834
I don't have that many brothers.

01:26:16.756 --> 01:26:18.258
Oh!
David!

01:26:19.092 --> 01:26:21.427
Get out of here!
I don't want to leave you!

01:26:21.594 --> 01:26:24.806
- Go on, get out of here.
- Wally's just on top of that hill.

01:26:25.014 --> 01:26:27.934
Go on! Get out of here.
Get out!

01:26:30.144 --> 01:26:32.647
Jump! Get the police!

01:26:44.576 --> 01:26:46.286
Here's the blind one.

01:26:46.828 --> 01:26:50.748
Come in, Mr. Kerew.
I'm delighted to see you.

01:26:50.957 --> 01:26:52.750
I'm delighted too.

01:26:52.959 --> 01:26:55.628
So you're the fat fuck
that runs this show.

01:26:55.837 --> 01:26:58.339
Beautifully put, Mr. Kerew.

01:26:58.548 --> 01:27:02.677
You're obviously a poet,
a man after my own heart.

01:27:02.886 --> 01:27:05.138
The coin?
Yes. It's in my pocket.

01:27:05.346 --> 01:27:07.599
May I have it, please?

01:27:07.807 --> 01:27:10.101
Why bother with a phony coin?

01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:13.146
You're quite right, Mr. Kerew,
it's a phony.

01:27:13.354 --> 01:27:17.400
A magnificent phony.
May I have it, please?

01:27:17.609 --> 01:27:21.654
Mind telling me what
I've been running around
risking my life for?

01:27:22.697 --> 01:27:24.824
A superconductor.

01:27:25.033 --> 01:27:28.202
A room-temperature
superconductor.

01:27:28.411 --> 01:27:32.081
It may be the most valuable
material in this world.

01:27:32.498 --> 01:27:35.043
Imagine electric cable
the size of that coin

01:27:35.251 --> 01:27:37.670
that could light up
an entire city.

01:27:37.879 --> 01:27:39.589
You told me it was a gold coin.

01:27:39.797 --> 01:27:43.760
Making it look like a coin
was just a handy way
to get it out of Washington

01:27:43.968 --> 01:27:48.348
after I'd arranged
to borrow a small sample.

01:27:49.349 --> 01:27:52.185
I'm currently pointing
a gun at your head.

01:27:52.352 --> 01:27:53.811
Under the circumstances,

01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:57.732
you and I should
renegotiate our contract,
don't you?

01:27:58.399 --> 01:28:02.362
Yes, I do.
I agree with you completely.

01:28:02.987 --> 01:28:05.949
What would you say to

01:28:06.157 --> 01:28:10.119
one third of %8 million?

01:28:10.328 --> 01:28:12.038
Would you say that's fair?

01:28:12.246 --> 01:28:14.123
I'd say that that's extremely--

01:28:25.551 --> 01:28:26.636
What just happened?

01:28:27.929 --> 01:28:31.349
I turned out the lights,
just for a moment.

01:28:31.557 --> 01:28:34.018
Just long enough
to gain the advantage.

01:28:36.062 --> 01:28:40.066
I get the feeling I'm not the only
blind person in this room.

01:28:40.483 --> 01:28:43.194
You have great intuition,
Mr. Kerew.

01:28:43.903 --> 01:28:47.490
I also suspect you have
excellent hearing, like myself.

01:28:48.157 --> 01:28:52.078
A few sounds were all I needed
to lock in on poor Mr. Kirgo.

01:28:52.704 --> 01:28:53.913
It's too bad.

01:28:54.122 --> 01:28:57.583
I liked him. He was a gentleman.

01:28:57.750 --> 01:29:00.336
I can't see,
but I bet you're not crying.

01:29:00.503 --> 01:29:03.631
Nor can I see your face,
Mr. Kerew,

01:29:04.298 --> 01:29:07.760
yet I can hear you stoop down
to find Kirgo's pistol.

01:29:08.928 --> 01:29:10.596
Am I right, sir?

01:29:11.014 --> 01:29:13.933
Must I put a bullet
through you to prove it?

01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:16.436
Oh, no. You're a gentleman.
Get him.

01:29:16.602 --> 01:29:19.605
One murder a day is enough for you.
Get him.

01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:10.948
Did I hear something drop,
Mr. Kerew?

01:30:20.083 --> 01:30:24.170
Mr. Sutherland?
Perfect timing. Come in, my dear.

01:30:24.378 --> 01:30:26.172
I've brought the other one.

01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:27.507
Wally.

01:30:28.257 --> 01:30:29.967
Are you all right?

01:30:31.302 --> 01:30:33.304
You're very quiet, Mr. Kerew.

01:30:33.471 --> 01:30:36.641
Suddenly gone shy, have we?

01:30:37.767 --> 01:30:41.437
Adele got away.
The police will be here any minute.

01:30:43.773 --> 01:30:47.860
You'd better tell me
what happened to Mr. Kirgo,
Mr. Sutherland.

01:30:48.069 --> 01:30:49.904
Certainly, my dear.

01:30:50.113 --> 01:30:53.783
Mr. Kirgo decided
to renegotiate his contract

01:30:53.991 --> 01:30:56.536
and he put a pistol to my head.

01:30:56.702 --> 01:30:59.247
Eve, we've been associated
for five years.

01:30:59.413 --> 01:31:02.208
I want you to know
I have no intention
of killing you.

01:31:03.626 --> 01:31:05.128
So don't be frightened, dear.

01:31:05.294 --> 01:31:08.381
And, please,
don't do anything rash.

01:31:08.631 --> 01:31:13.719
Oh. No, I wouldn't do that.
You know I trust you,
Mr. Sutherland.

01:31:14.303 --> 01:31:16.347
But what are your intentions?

01:31:16.722 --> 01:31:20.560
To leave the country as soon
as Raoul sets my helicopter down.

01:31:20.726 --> 01:31:22.895
I invite you to come along.

01:31:23.062 --> 01:31:26.023
Rio can be captivating
this time of year.

01:31:26.899 --> 01:31:29.193
Just pick up the gold coin

01:31:29.402 --> 01:31:33.072
I believe is on the floor
in front of you.

01:31:37.410 --> 01:31:38.411
I don't see it.

01:31:38.578 --> 01:31:39.620
<i>Good.</i>

01:31:39.787 --> 01:31:43.749
Look in Mr. Kirgo's left hand.
I think he may be holding it for us.

01:31:50.047 --> 01:31:53.384
Did you find it, my dear?

01:31:53.593 --> 01:31:54.886
Yes.

01:31:55.761 --> 01:31:57.263
Yes, I found it.

01:31:58.055 --> 01:32:01.517
Would you hand it to me, please?

01:32:03.603 --> 01:32:05.897
May I ask what my share might be?

01:32:07.648 --> 01:32:08.858
One...

01:32:09.901 --> 01:32:13.529
half of %8 million.

01:32:14.113 --> 01:32:16.115
Would you say that's fair?

01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:21.245
Yes. Yes, I think that's very fair.

01:32:28.377 --> 01:32:31.088
Dave! What's going on?

01:32:33.299 --> 01:32:34.634
Dave?

01:32:35.509 --> 01:32:36.928
Dave?

01:32:42.016 --> 01:32:45.645
Dave? What just happened?

01:32:45.811 --> 01:32:48.648
Mr. Sutherland is no longer
with us.

01:32:48.814 --> 01:32:51.567
Dave? Dave!

01:32:51.734 --> 01:32:53.527
I'm right here, Wally.

01:32:55.238 --> 01:32:58.157
I hear the sirens.
The police will be here soon.

01:32:58.824 --> 01:33:00.493
If you drop that pistol now,

01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:04.497
you'll probably make license plates
for a couple of years.

01:33:05.706 --> 01:33:07.833
I'll even wait for you
if you want.

01:33:08.251 --> 01:33:11.003
Thanks. That's real sweet.

01:33:12.421 --> 01:33:14.006
But, you see,

01:33:14.173 --> 01:33:17.927
you're the ones they're looking for.

01:33:18.261 --> 01:33:19.720
Not me.

01:33:20.054 --> 01:33:24.850
So if I get on that helicopter
with the coin, I get out of here
squeaky clean.

01:33:25.893 --> 01:33:28.354
You're too tall for me anyway.

01:33:29.272 --> 01:33:31.691
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to lock you in.

01:33:32.817 --> 01:33:33.859
Sorry.

01:33:37.697 --> 01:33:39.573
Damn, she smells good.

01:33:40.866 --> 01:33:44.203
I hear jail ain't so bad, anyway,
if you like it up the butt.

01:33:45.705 --> 01:33:48.541
I'm over here, Wally.
Over where, Dave?

01:33:48.958 --> 01:33:52.545
Dave? Dave? Da--

01:33:52.712 --> 01:33:56.382
Shit, who the hell I'm talking to?
He can't hear me.

01:34:07.935 --> 01:34:12.231
She's running to the helicopter.
Nice air conditioning she made, huh?

01:34:14.734 --> 01:34:17.153
You ever want to be in the circus?

01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:19.071
No, afraid of heights.

01:34:19.405 --> 01:34:22.241
Would you give me your jacket?
What for?

01:34:22.408 --> 01:34:24.327
There we go. This should be fun.

01:34:24.535 --> 01:34:26.329
Ready?
We're not up high, are we?

01:34:26.537 --> 01:34:29.498
No, no, just a few feet
off the ground.

01:34:29.707 --> 01:34:32.543
Ready, and go!
I'm ready!

01:34:37.798 --> 01:34:39.300
I just knocked over a tree!

01:34:39.467 --> 01:34:41.761
You said we wasn't up high!
It's fine.

01:34:41.927 --> 01:34:43.596
I'll kill you, you fuck!

01:34:44.513 --> 01:34:48.726
You telling me we're not up
in the air? What do you mean
we're not up in the air?

01:34:48.893 --> 01:34:51.854
Get ready.
You said we wasn't up in the air!

01:34:52.063 --> 01:34:53.272
Get ready.

01:34:53.439 --> 01:34:55.775
Bomb-bay doors open!
Raoul!

01:34:55.941 --> 01:34:58.444
- Raoul! Start it up!
- Get ready to fire one!

01:35:00.279 --> 01:35:01.697
And fire one!

01:35:04.784 --> 01:35:05.910
Fire two!

01:35:29.850 --> 01:35:32.645
What? Hey! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

01:35:32.812 --> 01:35:36.148
I don't know, but I learnt this
at the Braille Institute.

01:35:36.315 --> 01:35:39.151
They told us to feel around
and see what's happening.

01:35:39.527 --> 01:35:41.570
Stop that!
Get your hands off of me!

01:35:47.827 --> 01:35:49.662
Hold it! Hold it right there!

01:35:49.829 --> 01:35:52.289
I said hold it,
or I'll throw your brains out!

01:35:52.456 --> 01:35:55.751
I'll throw this knife through your brain!
Freeze!

01:35:57.461 --> 01:35:59.964
Do as I say, or you're a dead man.
Turn around!

01:36:02.383 --> 01:36:03.426
Face front!

01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:10.433
That's better. Now put
your hands over your head.

01:36:12.184 --> 01:36:14.895
Come on, get them up!
Get your hands up!

01:36:15.312 --> 01:36:18.023
Oh, you do speak English.
Come on over here.

01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:21.735
Get your ass over here.

01:36:22.486 --> 01:36:24.363
Quickly, quickly! Slowly.
Slowly!

01:36:28.868 --> 01:36:30.536
Come on, come on.

01:36:32.204 --> 01:36:34.123
Not now, Wally, I'm busy.

01:36:34.331 --> 01:36:36.375
Come on, keep coming,

01:36:36.542 --> 01:36:39.753
you funny little turd.

01:36:39.962 --> 01:36:42.798
Hey, Tarzan, turn around
and take a look.

01:36:51.015 --> 01:36:52.600
When did you guys get here?

01:36:52.808 --> 01:36:55.227
I sure was worried
about you two.

01:36:55.394 --> 01:36:56.729
It's all over.

01:37:01.609 --> 01:37:04.445
Oh. Goodbye,
Captain Braddock.

01:37:06.739 --> 01:37:09.241
Captain Braddock,
you're a dickhead.

01:37:09.408 --> 01:37:12.077
You son of a bitch.
No, no, no, captain.

01:37:12.244 --> 01:37:15.164
- I got a surprise for you!
- You can't do that.

01:37:15.331 --> 01:37:17.833
Let me go. I know the law.
I get to shoot them.

01:37:18.042 --> 01:37:20.586
No, you can't.
What do you mean I can't shoot them?

01:37:20.794 --> 01:37:24.089
Captain, we got the real killer.
We got the real killer.

01:37:24.256 --> 01:37:26.634
What are you telling me,
I can't shoot them?

01:37:26.842 --> 01:37:29.094
No, sir, I'm afraid
you can't. Come on.

01:37:29.303 --> 01:37:33.849
We went to all this trouble to catch
them, and now I can't shoot them?

01:37:34.016 --> 01:37:36.268
It's time to go.
Come on.

01:37:36.435 --> 01:37:39.647
I want to shoot them.
I want to shoot them!

01:37:39.855 --> 01:37:43.275
No, no, no. We'll get
a nice hot chocolate.

01:37:43.484 --> 01:37:46.028
Why can't I shoot them?

01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:52.284
We had a damn good time, didn't we?
Yeah.

01:37:53.452 --> 01:37:55.204
Lot of nice memories.

01:37:59.542 --> 01:38:03.796
There's something I've been wanting
to do since the day I met you.

01:38:03.963 --> 01:38:07.550
That was two days ago.
That's right. That's right.

01:38:08.092 --> 01:38:10.594
Well, there's something
I've wanted to give you.

01:38:10.761 --> 01:38:14.431
Dave, you don't have
to give me anything.

01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:16.308
You're a real nice guy.

01:38:16.475 --> 01:38:21.313
But I want to give it to you.
Dave, please, listen to me.

01:38:21.522 --> 01:38:24.608
I have a lot of love for you.
Thank you.

01:38:28.988 --> 01:38:31.824
So tell me, how does it feel
to be handicapped?

01:38:31.991 --> 01:38:33.784
I always wanted to ask you that.

01:38:33.993 --> 01:38:37.288
I'm not handicapped.
I have you.
