Is this you and Alan every year?

00:14.334 --> 00:16.901
EDIE: Yep, every Christmas
morning for the last 17 years,

00:16.937 --> 00:18.703
Alan and I would go
to Santa's Village in the mall

00:18.738 --> 00:21.246
and dress up like mom and son reindeer.

00:21.295 --> 00:23.908
Yep. It's a really cool thing
that I love doing still.

00:23.944 --> 00:25.276
You know, they should change
the name of Christmas

00:25.312 --> 00:27.512
to "Edie and Alanmas."
[chuckles]

[door opens, closes]

00:35.188 --> 00:37.222
Happy Grafelnik!

00:37.257 --> 00:42.127
I'm Vengeful Vic. I bring tidings of
joylessness and revenge. [chuckles]

00:42.162 --> 00:42.811
Don't freak out, guys.

00:42.812 --> 00:45.296
- It's just me, Zorn. [chuckles]
- EDIE: Grafelnik? [exhales]

00:45.332 --> 00:47.866
You're still celebrating
that dumb revenge holiday?

00:47.901 --> 00:50.335
Yeah, I went back to celebrating
it after we split up.

00:50.370 --> 00:51.936
Now, who wants to give me
the traditional Grafelnik

00:51.972 --> 00:52.971
punch in the face, huh?

00:53.006 --> 00:54.639
- I'll go first.
- Can I go second?

00:54.674 --> 00:57.575
I'll go third,
but I have a question.

00:57.611 --> 00:59.744
- What is Grafelnik?
- Well, as legend has it,

00:59.779 --> 01:02.180
a long time ago,
Lord Grafelnik was trying

01:02.215 --> 01:05.049
to reconnect with his daughter.
But she wanted to study in Europe,

01:05.084 --> 01:07.185
where she caught the eye
of some dangerous types

01:07.220 --> 01:08.186
and ended up
getting kidnapped.

01:08.221 --> 01:10.755
The only person who
could get her back

01:10.790 --> 01:11.956
was Lord Grafelnik himself.

01:11.992 --> 01:13.358
Hey, that sounds like
the movie Taken.

01:13.393 --> 01:14.792
No, I'm sure whatever that is,

01:14.828 --> 01:16.794
it's totally different.
You see, Lord Grafelnik

01:16.830 --> 01:19.831
had a very specific set of skills.
And he used those skills

01:19.866 --> 01:22.233
to get revenge while
killing, like, everyone

01:22.269 --> 01:24.068
and rescuing
his precious daughter.

01:24.104 --> 01:25.770
- I am riveted.
- ALAN: Oh, yeah,

01:25.805 --> 01:27.305
you should see that movie
then; that's the same thing.

01:27.340 --> 01:29.541
The blonde girl from Lost,
she plays the daughter.

01:29.576 --> 01:32.410
- Maggie Grace?
- ALAN: Hey, so what's in that sack?

01:32.445 --> 01:36.181
Oh, yeah, Grafelnik snowballs! [grunts]
[all gasping]

01:36.216 --> 01:37.248
Pretty neat, huh?

01:37.284 --> 01:38.249
Grafelnik snowballs are rocks.

01:38.285 --> 01:40.685
Grafelnik snowballs are rocks.

So, you excited to spend your
first Grafelnik with your old man?

01:50.330 --> 01:51.462
You better be,
because the revenge

01:51.498 --> 01:54.465
- I'll bring upon you if you aren't is horrible.
- ALAN: No, I'm excited all right.

01:54.501 --> 01:56.768
Even though it's kind of like
a holiday for the little guy,

01:56.803 --> 01:59.304
I feel like I'll still be able
to have some fun with it, too.

01:59.339 --> 02:01.639
Mom, you're cool with me doing
Grafelnik with Dad, right?

02:01.675 --> 02:04.175
Yeah, I think it's great you and
your dad have your own thing.

02:04.211 --> 02:07.612
Look at you guys, celebrating
both holidays, no fighting.

02:07.647 --> 02:09.814
For a divorced couple,
you make a great team.

02:09.848 --> 02:12.817
Go Team Zorn and Edie!
Yay!

02:12.852 --> 02:14.452
- Yeah, okay, Craig.
- Aye yai yai, Craig.

02:14.487 --> 02:16.387
You know, you never think
you need to own pom-poms

02:16.423 --> 02:17.589
until you do. [chuckles]

02:17.624 --> 02:19.457
I know what I want for
Christmas. [chuckles]

02:19.492 --> 02:20.525
[whispers]: Pom-poms.

02:20.560 --> 02:23.595

I'm dreaming of a wine Christmas.

02:23.630 --> 02:24.896
[chuckling]

02:24.897 --> 02:27.766
[dramatic music]

02:27.767 --> 02:33.004
- I got to go.
- What? Um...

02:33.039 --> 02:34.739
- What got into him?
- ZORN: Yeah.

02:34.774 --> 02:38.243
[door closes] If he doesn't have
diarrhea, that exit was insane.

02:44.818 --> 02:46.017

Oh, Scott!

- Yeah.

02:52.459 --> 02:54.092
This is my Hanukkah
night five gift.

02:54.127 --> 02:55.627

you're gonna pee yourself

02:55.662 --> 02:57.362

02:57.397 --> 02:58.363
[whispers]: A lot.

- Wow.
- Vroom, vroom.

facial hair.

03:02.269 --> 03:03.301

03:03.336 --> 03:05.670
- than that German exchange student.
- Helmut?

03:05.705 --> 03:07.105
- Helmut, Helmut.
- Helmut, that guy rocks.

03:07.140 --> 03:08.239
- I love that guy.
- He's the best.

03:08.275 --> 03:09.774
He just goes like, "Yah."

03:09.809 --> 03:12.443
- "Yah."
- God! My mom would never get me

03:12.479 --> 03:14.012
something this cool
for Christmas.

03:14.047 --> 03:15.280
I desperately need a new phone.

03:15.315 --> 03:17.782
- Like, actually need a new phone, right?
- Yeah, it's so old.

03:17.817 --> 03:19.851
- It's a brick.
- What about your dad?

03:19.886 --> 03:21.719
Yeah, my dad celebrates
something called Grafelnik.

03:21.755 --> 03:23.421
It's like Christmas,
but not at all.

03:23.456 --> 03:24.989
I'm supposed to meet
up with him later

03:25.025 --> 03:26.924
and do, like, revenge or
something. I don't know.

03:26.960 --> 03:28.760
Does it end with him
giving you stuff? [scoffs]

03:28.795 --> 03:30.361
I hope so. I mean,
getting gifts is one of

03:30.397 --> 03:32.930
- the top three perks of having parents.
- True.

03:39.606 --> 03:41.139
No, we are;

- the traditional Grafelnik greeting.
- Oh, Grafel...

for the Grafelnik thing. [horn honks]

03:59.259 --> 04:00.825
Oh, my God, I can't believe
you fell for it.

- Okay.

04:25.452 --> 04:28.219
- Sit down?
- Oh, it's a sit down talk.

04:28.254 --> 04:31.089
Look, Edie, there are some things
about me that you don't know.

04:31.124 --> 04:33.825
- Okay.
- Things that I thought that I could

04:33.860 --> 04:35.827
hide forever, or at least until
after we were married,

04:35.862 --> 04:38.996
and then it would be too late
for you to do anything about it.

04:39.032 --> 04:41.899
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm afraid of Santa Claus.

04:41.935 --> 04:45.570
[laughs]: What?
No.

04:45.605 --> 04:48.005
Yeah, Edie, it's true.

04:48.041 --> 04:51.542
It started when I was six,
right after my parents separated.

04:51.578 --> 04:52.844
[Christmas music playing]

04:57.650 --> 05:00.551
<i>my mom's "friend" Hank was there.</i>

05:00.587 --> 05:03.521
I stood there and watched
as Santa Claus...

05:03.556 --> 05:08.659
gave Hank a holly jolly
ass-whooping. It was not pretty.

05:08.695 --> 05:11.629
<i>It was like an outtake
from a Tarantino movie.</i>

05:11.664 --> 05:16.033

whenever I see Santa,

05:32.152 --> 05:35.019
I can't help but picture
that bloody mess.

05:35.054 --> 05:37.755
Oh... Craig.

05:37.791 --> 05:40.725
I'm not gonna lie,
a lot of women would be

05:42.295 --> 05:43.561
- No!
- Yeah.

05:43.596 --> 05:45.363
But maybe I can help you
get over your fear.

05:45.398 --> 05:48.633
[chuckles]: Oh, right. You think
anybody can just do therapy?

05:48.668 --> 05:51.202
Like, it's that easy
to be a therapist?

05:51.237 --> 05:54.071
No?
Sort of?

05:54.107 --> 05:55.907
I don't know how to answer that.

05:55.942 --> 05:59.277
But maybe if you tried that
immersion therapy thing,

05:59.312 --> 06:02.146
where you just surround
yourself with the fear,

06:02.182 --> 06:04.916
so much so that it takes
away the power of it.

06:04.951 --> 06:07.151
You know,
that actually might work.

06:07.187 --> 06:11.923
[chuckles] Geez, I guess it really
is that easy to become a therapist.

06:11.958 --> 06:13.891
Why do I make
such a big deal about it?

06:13.927 --> 06:16.594
- I don't know, I really don't.
- Oh, mm-mm.

06:27.140 --> 06:28.773
Yeah, this is that place
where that waiter

06:28.808 --> 06:31.242
gave me a hamburger
instead of a veggie burger.

06:31.277 --> 06:35.613
Let's just say it's time for
them to "meat" with some payback.

06:35.648 --> 06:39.083
Ground chuck style.
80% lean.

06:39.118 --> 06:41.118
Yeah, that didn't
really land, did it?

06:41.154 --> 06:42.720
Should have just left it
at ground chuck, right?

06:42.755 --> 06:44.121
<i>Here we go!</i>

06:45.658 --> 06:47.225
Oh. [gasps]

06:50.029 --> 06:52.430
Come on, come on,
let's get out of here!

06:52.465 --> 06:53.531
[both laugh]

06:53.566 --> 06:55.766
Oh, yeah. You know what,
that was actually, like,

06:55.802 --> 06:57.602
a pretty good reason
for an animal to give its life.

06:57.637 --> 07:00.271
- Grafelnik is amazing.
- Well, if you like that,

07:00.306 --> 07:01.839
you're gonna love
Grafelnik morning.

07:01.875 --> 07:03.574
Hope you wrote your letter
to Vengeful Vic

07:03.610 --> 07:05.076
asking for all the revenge
you want.

07:05.111 --> 07:07.612
Question: is it possible
to put some things on that list

07:07.647 --> 07:10.214
other than revenge?
You know, just, like,

07:10.250 --> 07:12.683
things you would buy
in a retail store?

07:12.719 --> 07:13.918
Wh-What, you mean like presents?

07:13.953 --> 07:15.720
Oh, I mean, if you want
to call them that.

07:15.755 --> 07:17.522
Yeah, well, not in the old days.

07:17.557 --> 07:19.790
But now that they've made it
all commercial and everything,

07:19.826 --> 07:22.193
gifts are actually exchanged
as revenge against poor people

07:22.228 --> 07:24.695
- who can't afford gifts.
- Great.

07:24.731 --> 07:27.365
Let me just set a reminder
for Grafelnik morning.

07:27.400 --> 07:30.968
[groans] Phone is
just so difficult to use.

07:31.004 --> 07:32.670
This thing is, like,
three years old.

07:32.705 --> 07:35.139
On a new model, which is
currently available in stores,

07:35.174 --> 07:39.176
you just simply say say, "Set a
reminder for Grafelnik morning."

07:39.212 --> 07:41.212
- Boom! And there.
- Wow, you know,

07:41.247 --> 07:44.048
that seems like a lot of steps
to still probably forget something.

07:44.083 --> 07:45.983
Uh, it says in the calendar here

07:46.019 --> 07:48.819
that Grafelnik is
on December 25 this year.

07:48.855 --> 07:51.022
Wait, hold on, Christmas and
Grafelnik are on the same day?

07:51.057 --> 07:53.824
Well, obviously,
there's only one thing to do.

07:53.860 --> 07:56.260
Celebrate Grafelnik
and ignore Christmas entirely!

07:56.296 --> 07:57.762
EDIE: [scoffs] No way.

07:57.797 --> 08:00.898
Why don't we ignore Grafelnik
entirely, like everyone else on Earth.

08:00.934 --> 08:03.560
Look, I want to spend
Grafelnik with my son. I mean,

08:03.561 --> 08:06.037
every year I have to spend
it alone with my slaves.

08:06.072 --> 08:07.538
And believe me, paying people

08:07.574 --> 08:10.074
to pretend they love you
is not as fun as it sounds.

08:10.109 --> 08:11.442
Okay, you know what, I'm gonna
take the high road here.

08:11.477 --> 08:13.578
- Oh, come on.
- Why don't we compromise?

08:13.613 --> 08:14.712
[groans]

08:14.747 --> 08:18.549
- I will take Alan from 7:00 to 9:30.
- I'm not getting up at 7:00.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.284
Then you can have him
from 9:30 to noon.

08:20.320 --> 08:21.786
No, no, hold on.
The Grafelnik festivities

08:21.821 --> 08:25.022
- start at sunrise and take five hours.
- I have to get up at sunrise now?

08:25.058 --> 08:27.369
I mean, what are we supposed
to do, cut the glombeast's

08:27.370 --> 08:29.226
head half off and just
leave it hanging there?

08:29.262 --> 08:31.562
[chuckles]: It's just, I mean,
that would be funny, sure,

08:31.598 --> 08:33.264
but actually, you know what,
that would be really funny.

08:33.299 --> 08:36.000
We're gonna do that. But we
still need five hours, okay?

08:36.034 --> 08:37.702
So you take the afternoon.

08:37.736 --> 08:39.303
My son and I
are not brunch people.

08:39.339 --> 08:41.772
- Yeah, and do I get a say here? Huh?
- Yeah, Zorn.

08:41.808 --> 08:43.274
- Let's let him decide.
- Who do you want

08:43.308 --> 08:44.508
to be with, Alangulon?
Let's hear it.

08:44.544 --> 08:45.776
Mull it over. Come on.

08:45.812 --> 08:49.146
Oh, okay, I guess that
kind of backfired.

08:49.182 --> 08:52.883
- I got to think on this one.
- Take your time deciding!

08:52.919 --> 08:56.091
Hey, either way, I win.
If he chooses me, I win.

08:56.126 --> 08:57.743
And if he chooses you,
well, then I've got

08:57.744 --> 09:00.781
someone to seek revenge
on, so I win again.

09:02.529 --> 09:05.797
[music]
Hey, what's in that bin?

09:05.832 --> 09:07.866
It's not Santa heads, is it?

09:07.901 --> 09:10.502
No. It's just some
precious family memories

09:10.537 --> 09:12.257
I want to share with Alan, so he can see

09:12.258 --> 09:14.672
- how meaningful our...
- ...holiday traditions will be.

09:14.708 --> 09:16.141
When Alan sees
how much fun he has

09:16.176 --> 09:17.308
spending Grafelnik with me,

09:17.344 --> 09:20.078
he's gonna completely
forget about Christmas.

09:20.113 --> 09:22.547
I mean, getting revenge
on bosses, coworkers,

09:22.582 --> 09:25.292
baristas that write "Lorn" on
your latte, even though they

09:25.293 --> 09:28.186
know damn well no man is named
that, I mean, it's just the best.

09:28.221 --> 09:30.922
And what if he doesn't love it
as much as you do?

09:30.957 --> 09:33.258
Then I'll just remind him
about the high suicide rate

09:33.293 --> 09:35.326
of fathers who are alone
during the holidays.

09:35.362 --> 09:39.998
So you're gonna guilt him
into choosing you? I...

09:40.033 --> 09:41.866
...don't think that's
such a great idea.

09:41.902 --> 09:44.068
You're not helping Alan
by applying pressure.

09:44.104 --> 09:46.471
He's not a hemorrhaging
stab wound.

09:46.506 --> 09:48.740
And besides, you said you were
gonna take the high road.

09:48.775 --> 09:50.675
Fine, I guess I'll just
tell him I have cancer.

09:50.710 --> 09:53.411
- Edie!
- Skin cancer. Not a real...

09:53.446 --> 09:55.380
...cancer, just something
that would tip the scales

09:55.415 --> 09:56.748
in my favor, you know?

09:56.783 --> 10:01.352
Well, as a skin cancer survivor,
I think it would totally work.

10:01.388 --> 10:04.689
- But you still probably shouldn't do it.
- Fine.

10:04.724 --> 10:07.358
But trust me, if I know Edie,
she's doing the exact same thing.

10:07.394 --> 10:10.062
In fact, right at this moment,
she's probably spending

10:10.063 --> 10:12.397
- all her energy doing...
- EDIE [moans]: Craig!

10:12.432 --> 10:15.800
That was amazing!
[sighs]

10:15.835 --> 10:19.771
- Still think Santa's scary now?
- Mm, yes.

10:19.806 --> 10:22.607
But it's gotten complicated.

10:22.642 --> 10:24.275
[scoffs]

10:25.445 --> 10:28.046
[whistles]
Are you kidding me?

10:28.081 --> 10:30.114
Mom's trying to guilt me
with my childhood artwork,

10:30.150 --> 10:31.852
and Dad's sending me
videos of orgies he's

10:31.853 --> 10:33.751
missing out on in Zephyria
just to be in America.

10:33.787 --> 10:36.421
Well, Alan, when you're
the child of divorce,

10:36.456 --> 10:37.855
the holidays can be rough.

10:37.891 --> 10:40.425
When I was a kid, on
Christmas, I felt like

10:40.460 --> 10:42.627
I was a rope in
a game of tug-of-war.

10:42.662 --> 10:45.997
[feminine voice]: "Craig, you have to
come spend the holidays with us in Ohio."

10:46.032 --> 10:48.499
[Nigerian accent]: "No, Craig,
on this day, you come stay with me

10:48.535 --> 10:50.935
in Calhoun Falls, South Carolina."

10:50.971 --> 10:52.036
Whoa.

10:52.072 --> 10:54.038
For me, the holidays was
nothing but arguing.

10:54.074 --> 10:57.775
And I could have really taken
advantage of their immaturity.

10:57.811 --> 10:59.410
Take advantage?
Like how?

10:59.446 --> 11:03.181
Oh, you know, pit them against
one another. Use their desire

11:03.216 --> 11:05.950
to spend the holidays with me
to my own selfish ends.

11:05.986 --> 11:07.552
Oh, like to get better presents?

11:07.587 --> 11:10.388
Well, yeah, I mean, I
guess that's one example,

11:10.423 --> 11:12.323
but it doesn't matter.
Alan, you're a good kid,

11:12.359 --> 11:13.791
you would never do
something like that.

11:13.827 --> 11:16.995
Oh, no.
Of course not. I would...

11:17.030 --> 11:18.629
I would never.

11:20.233 --> 11:21.866
[whispers]: Leave Mommy
and Hank alone.

11:21.901 --> 11:25.603
- What?
- Oh, nothing. I like the glitter on this one.

11:25.639 --> 11:27.171
Cool giant head, huh?

11:27.207 --> 11:29.340
A lot of Zephyrians
go with a fake giant head,

11:29.376 --> 11:32.277
but you can't beat the smell
of the real thing.

11:32.312 --> 11:35.413
Hey, uh, just so you know,
I haven't really decided yet,

11:35.448 --> 11:38.750
but, um, I'm thinking about
doing Christmas with Mom.

11:38.785 --> 11:41.386
Yeah, um, she said she might
get me a 4K projector.

11:41.421 --> 11:43.221
- Pretty crazy right?
- If you like that,

11:43.256 --> 11:45.189
how about a gold necklace
that says "Alangulon,"

11:45.225 --> 11:47.225
that may or may not
make you taller?

11:47.260 --> 11:49.541
ALAN: Hey, so I'm thinking about

11:49.542 --> 11:52.463
spending Grafelnik
morning over at Dad's.

11:52.499 --> 11:54.899
Only because he said he was
gonna get me some jewelry.

11:54.934 --> 11:56.634
He didn't specify,
but I kind of think

11:56.670 --> 11:59.837
- it's gonna be magical jewelry, so...
- He's bribing you with gifts?

11:59.873 --> 12:01.639
That's disgusting.

12:01.675 --> 12:04.042
This competition is supposed
to be about who loves you more.

12:04.077 --> 12:06.477
Right.
I totally agree.

12:06.513 --> 12:08.146
And I know you feel Christmas
is more about

12:08.181 --> 12:11.516
spending time together than gifts,
so I totally respect that.

12:11.551 --> 12:13.251
Well, get ready
to respect me even more,

12:13.286 --> 12:14.986
because you're about to
get everything you want.

12:15.021 --> 12:16.254
Oh, well, in that case,

12:16.289 --> 12:18.790
I guess I better get started
on a list. [chuckles]

12:20.226 --> 12:22.193
[music]

12:24.397 --> 12:26.631
<i>Yeah.</i>

12:29.202 --> 12:32.804
Okay, Edie, I can't do this.
Can't we just convert to Judaism?

12:32.839 --> 12:35.440
Scott's mom really loves it,
and we wouldn't have to do squat

12:35.475 --> 12:37.141
on a Friday night ever again.

12:37.177 --> 12:40.445
Honey, you can do this,
because I am here for you

12:40.480 --> 12:42.380
and I'm not leaving your side...
[phone vibrating]

12:42.415 --> 12:44.015
for more than a few minutes.

12:44.050 --> 12:45.817
Alan just added a food
processor to his wish list.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.185
[groans]
Okay, I'm gonna go get this.

12:47.220 --> 12:49.721
- You'll be fine.
- I will not be!

12:49.756 --> 12:53.291
I will not be!
It's okay, little girl.

12:53.326 --> 12:55.560
I'm just nervous because once,
I saw Santa beat up somebody

12:55.595 --> 12:57.061
who was having sex
with my mother.

12:57.097 --> 12:59.997
<i>It's not true, sweetheart.
Come on. Come.</i>

13:00.033 --> 13:04.736
- ALAN: I can feel your heartbeat!
- SCOTT: I know! That's the best part!

13:04.771 --> 13:05.703
Oh!

13:05.739 --> 13:06.771
[chuckles]

13:06.806 --> 13:08.673
Yeah, it's so irregular.

13:08.708 --> 13:10.708
Man, you get the best
Hanukkah presents.

13:10.744 --> 13:12.744
I thank Jesus every day
Jane told my mom

13:12.779 --> 13:14.512
that she'd leave her
if she didn't convert.

13:14.547 --> 13:17.115
- How's your Christmas haul coming?
- Amazing.

13:17.150 --> 13:19.016
Yeah, I'm totally pitting
my parents against each other.

13:19.052 --> 13:20.952
- Yeah?  - They're gonna
spend so much money on gifts,

13:20.987 --> 13:23.087
they're not gonna have enough
money left over for my college.

13:23.123 --> 13:25.590
[laughs] Nice.
You know what you should do?

13:25.625 --> 13:27.558
Get one of your parents to
buy you a helmet with a visor.

13:27.594 --> 13:30.128
That way, when I spit
when I talk, you won't get hit.

13:30.163 --> 13:32.263
I like that idea,
but I'm-a do you one better.

13:32.298 --> 13:34.665
- Get your own scooter?
- No, that's, uh, two better.

13:34.701 --> 13:36.968
- Hmm.
- I was thinking a sidecar.

13:37.003 --> 13:38.202
Sidecar?

13:38.238 --> 13:40.371
Oh, my God! Yes!
We could be like, uh,

13:40.407 --> 13:42.874
uh, Gertrude Stein
and Alice B. Toklas!

13:42.909 --> 13:45.009
Yeah, or people I know about.
[chuckles]

13:45.044 --> 13:47.779
But do you think your parents
would actually buy you one?

13:47.814 --> 13:50.114
I got your big Grafelnik gift
a little early.

13:50.150 --> 13:52.784
- You asked and you shall receive.
- Oh!

13:52.819 --> 13:54.419
- ZORN: It's a sidecar!
- ALAN: What the...

13:54.454 --> 13:56.287
- Well, it's a hover sidecar.
- I love it!

13:56.322 --> 13:58.296
Yup, there's nothing like
the feeling of sitting

13:58.297 --> 14:00.391
next to someone who's having
the time of their lives.

14:00.427 --> 14:04.896
ALAN: Oh, my gosh.
It just stays right there!

14:04.931 --> 14:06.531
Well, I can't buy
something more expensive

14:06.566 --> 14:09.400
or dangerous than this,
so I guess you win.

14:09.436 --> 14:12.101
- Whoa!
- Edie, don't belittle my holiday

14:12.102 --> 14:13.371
and make it about winning, okay?

14:13.406 --> 14:15.306
- But yes, I'm very happy that I won.
- ALAN: Thanks, Dad.

14:15.341 --> 14:17.074
- This is so awesome!
- You bet, kiddo.

14:17.110 --> 14:20.475
Oh, Edie, if it makes you feel
any better, I saw you eyeballing

14:20.476 --> 14:23.314
those Grafelnik snowballs
the other day, so... [grunts]

14:23.416 --> 14:27.467
- [car alarm blaring] Ooh.
- Happy Grafelnik!

14:30.113 --> 14:32.987
- Hey.
- If those are more presents

14:32.988 --> 14:36.017
- for Alan, we don't need them.
- Nope. I had to keep buying things

14:36.052 --> 14:38.286
so that mall security wouldn't
think that I was a pedophile.

14:38.321 --> 14:39.821
Well, I'm glad you're sticking

14:39.856 --> 14:41.823
- with the Santa immersion therapy.
- Mm.

14:41.858 --> 14:43.925
At least one of us
might have a good Christmas.

14:43.960 --> 14:46.861
Ho-ho hold up.
What is going on here?

14:46.896 --> 14:49.430
Alan's spending Grafelnik with Zorn.

14:49.466 --> 14:52.588
[sighs]: I don't know how
I let myself get caught up

14:52.589 --> 14:56.004
in that whole gift competition.
I'm so disappointed in myself.

14:56.039 --> 14:58.863
Well, let's turn that disappointment

14:58.864 --> 15:03.077
into an appointment with Dr. Craig.
[chuckles]

15:03.113 --> 15:04.512
I prescribe for you...

15:05.882 --> 15:10.385
- ...one scoop of tuna.
- Yeah, I don't need tuna.

15:10.420 --> 15:12.553
- I need to apologize to Alan.
- Okay.

15:12.589 --> 15:15.189
I hope that's not
the good scooper.

15:15.225 --> 15:18.280
Any scooper with tuna in it
is a good scooper. [chuckles]

15:19.095 --> 15:22.664
Dude! I got, like, the best
gift ever. My plan worked

15:22.699 --> 15:25.133
<i>like a dream.
They had no idea</i>

15:25.168 --> 15:27.235
<i>I was totally playing them
off of each other.</i>

15:27.270 --> 15:29.337
Yeah, it's as though
I were a puppet master

15:29.372 --> 15:31.921
and they were just two people
I tricked into coming

15:31.922 --> 15:33.141
to my dumb puppet show.

15:33.176 --> 15:36.177
<i>[laughs] Yeah, who knows,
if I play my cards right,</i>

15:36.212 --> 15:39.380
<i>next year I could
probably get braces. [laughs]</i>

15:39.416 --> 15:41.734
<i>- EDIE: Zorn, we need to talk.
- Oh, did you come here</i>

15:41.735 --> 15:43.851
for some pointers
on how to win at parenting?

15:43.887 --> 15:45.286
If so, you came
to the right place.

15:45.321 --> 15:47.422
- If not, I'm too busy.
- Alan played us

15:47.457 --> 15:49.991
against each other
just to get presents.

15:50.026 --> 15:52.326
No way, Edie. No, he's a
good kid. You know that.

15:52.362 --> 15:53.795
- You raised him.
- I was shocked, too.

15:53.830 --> 15:55.863
He usually gets confused
when he tries to lie.

15:55.899 --> 15:59.133
But I overheard him
scheming on the phone.

15:59.169 --> 16:01.969
What? You're kidding.
How could we be so blind?

16:02.005 --> 16:04.072
Oh, typical Zorn...
so caught up in winning.

16:04.107 --> 16:07.308
And typical Edie...
so focused on losing horribly.

16:07.343 --> 16:09.844
I guess we took things
too far, didn't we?

16:09.879 --> 16:12.113
Or maybe we didn't
take them far enough.

16:12.148 --> 16:15.883
What if we work together to
teach Alan the real meaning of...

16:15.919 --> 16:17.985
Christmas, Edie? [scoffs]
No, thank you.

16:18.021 --> 16:21.489
I was gonna say Grafelnik.
Let's try your Taken thing.

16:21.524 --> 16:24.025
- It's not the same as Taken!
- The point is revenge.

16:24.060 --> 16:25.827
Ooh, I like the sound of that.

16:25.862 --> 16:28.296
We need to teach Alan a
lesson, and I've got a plan.

16:28.331 --> 16:30.031
Grab that hammer
and just start breaking things.

16:30.066 --> 16:32.734
Okay, but you better be
going somewhere with this.

16:34.170 --> 16:35.269
Ha-ha!

16:35.305 --> 16:36.938
I would have broken
the hammer last,

16:36.973 --> 16:38.940
but I like your enthusiasm.

16:39.776 --> 16:41.409
[music]

16:41.444 --> 16:43.277
[zapping]

16:45.048 --> 16:47.014
[whooping]

16:48.251 --> 16:49.717
You sure you don't want to go

16:49.753 --> 16:51.419
- around the block one more time?
- Nah.

16:51.454 --> 16:53.755
Moderation is the key
to all aspects of life.

16:53.790 --> 16:55.723
[phone ringing]
Ooh.

16:55.759 --> 16:58.860
- I'm gonna use the Bluetooth.
- Yeah. Um...

16:58.895 --> 17:02.196
- Uh, uh-uh.
- Oh, there it is. [beep]

17:02.232 --> 17:05.122
<i>- Yo, Alan on the horn.
- ZORN: Alangulon! </i>

17:05.156 --> 17:06.634
<i>I need you to come to
my apartment right now!</i>

17:06.669 --> 17:09.737
<i>Oh, wow, hey, am I on Bluetooth?
That is so cool.</i>

17:09.772 --> 17:11.305
<i>- Everything's ruined!
- What?</i>

17:11.340 --> 17:12.573
<i>God, that sounds great.</i>

17:13.977 --> 17:16.577
Uh...
Dad, what happened?

17:16.613 --> 17:19.012
It was your mom.
She destroyed everything,

17:19.048 --> 17:20.848
including my sense of safety
in my own home.

17:20.884 --> 17:23.718
Mom? Why would...
Wait, no, why would Mom do that?

17:23.752 --> 17:25.086
Because of you, Alangulon.

17:25.121 --> 17:27.288
She's been trying
to win your love, and...

17:27.323 --> 17:29.791
she's jealous because I got you
that sidecar you wanted.

17:29.826 --> 17:31.225
[scoffs quietly]

17:31.261 --> 17:33.928
Oh, my God, this is crazy.

17:33.963 --> 17:36.402
You're right, it is crazy...
as crazy as the blind

17:36.403 --> 17:39.033
rage of a jealous mother on
a losing streak can unleash.

17:39.068 --> 17:41.602
Which means I have to be
even crazier.

17:41.638 --> 17:45.173
Oh, hey, uh, let's not go...
double-crazy here, all right?

17:45.208 --> 17:46.507
- Just...
- Ah, you know what?

17:46.543 --> 17:48.576
If your mom is going to destroy
everything I love,

17:48.611 --> 17:50.812
I'm gonna destroy
everything she loves!

17:50.847 --> 17:52.113
- Dad!
- No, I mean Christmas.

17:52.148 --> 17:56.036
I'm gonna sack Santa's Village.
You know, at the mall.

17:56.959 --> 17:59.059
Okay. [scoffs]
I don't know. He's not here.

17:59.094 --> 18:00.527
I'm sorry to rush you down here,

18:00.562 --> 18:02.329
but he said he was gonna
sack Santa's Village,

18:02.364 --> 18:04.564
and I'm pretty sure this is the
only one he even knows about.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.266
Well, I'm glad we're here.
We can support Craig.

18:06.301 --> 18:07.968
Craig!

18:08.003 --> 18:09.002
- ALAN: Oh.
- And don't worry

18:09.037 --> 18:12.376
- about your dad. He's all talk.
- Okay. [horn blows]

18:12.908 --> 18:15.141
<i>Surrender, Santa's villagers!</i>

18:15.177 --> 18:18.912
<i>I will reduce your village
to rubble in the name</i>

18:18.947 --> 18:22.082
of Grafelnik!
Your snowmen will die!

18:22.117 --> 18:24.184
Your reindeer
will be slaughtered!

18:24.219 --> 18:26.419
And your mall Santas will have

18:26.455 --> 18:28.921
their sex offender status revealed!

18:29.558 --> 18:31.558
[grunting, kids screaming]

18:35.464 --> 18:36.930
Get out of the way!

18:38.166 --> 18:40.367
[balloon pops, hisses]
EDIE: Craig, watch out!

18:40.402 --> 18:41.468
No, don't help!

18:41.503 --> 18:44.104
It's time for me to face
my Santa fears alone!

18:44.873 --> 18:49.809
ALAN: Dad! Stop it!
These mall cops are ex-cops!

18:49.845 --> 18:51.978
I only sack at one speed, son:

18:52.014 --> 18:55.244
- full.
- EDIE: Don't worry, Alan. I got this.

18:57.986 --> 18:59.719
[grunts]

18:59.755 --> 19:01.054
<i>ZORN: So it comes to this.</i>

19:01.089 --> 19:03.723
All I ever wanted was to
spend Grafelnik with my son.

19:03.759 --> 19:05.492
<i>EDIE: Yeah, and all I ever wanted</i>

19:05.527 --> 19:07.727
was to spend Christmas
with my son.

19:07.763 --> 19:09.029
[grunting]

19:11.967 --> 19:14.000
Ow!
Geez, Edie.

19:14.036 --> 19:17.604
And now your bounty
will burn as hot

19:17.639 --> 19:19.272
as my love for Alangulon.

19:19.308 --> 19:21.141
- What are you doing?
- Despite his inability to choose

19:21.176 --> 19:22.509
which one of us he loves more.

19:22.544 --> 19:24.377
- This isn't part of it.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait! Stop!

19:24.413 --> 19:26.980
- Oopsie. Too late.
- No! [gasps]

19:27.015 --> 19:28.081
[laughing]

19:28.116 --> 19:31.051
Okay, uh, this has gotten
totally out of control.

19:31.086 --> 19:33.513
I'm so sorry. I-I tried
to pit you two against

19:33.514 --> 19:35.889
each other for presents,
and just... I'm sorry!

19:35.924 --> 19:39.793
That's very sweet, Alangulon.
But you know what's sweeter?

19:39.828 --> 19:40.960
Revenge!

19:40.996 --> 19:42.195
[both laugh]

19:42.230 --> 19:43.997
This whole thing is fake,
you dummy!

19:44.032 --> 19:45.565
- What?
- ZORN: Uh, yeah!

19:45.600 --> 19:47.600
That's what you get for trying
to manipulate your parents!

19:47.636 --> 19:52.872
- So these terrified kids are actors?
- Uh, well, no.

19:52.908 --> 19:54.451
But one bad experience isn't gonna

19:54.452 --> 19:56.176
ruin them for the rest of their lives.

19:56.211 --> 19:58.645
[grunts] That did not work.

20:05.787 --> 20:07.120
All right, I'll admit it.

20:07.155 --> 20:09.923
I was skeptical of Taken,
but I'm won over.

20:09.958 --> 20:13.960
And yes, I do see tonal similarities
between the two narratives.

20:13.995 --> 20:15.462
So, I just talked to
the people from the mall,

20:15.497 --> 20:16.796
- and we don't have to pay for anything.
- Hmm.

20:16.832 --> 20:18.965
EDIE: Turns out, they
celebrate Grafelnik, too.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.034
Apparently, the entire mall
was built to take revenge

20:21.069 --> 20:23.837
- on small family-owned businesses.
- ZORN: Wait, wait, wait.

20:23.872 --> 20:26.106
Hold on. This isn't exactly
like Grafelnik.

20:26.141 --> 20:28.074
In his story, both
Lord Grafelnik and his daughter

20:28.110 --> 20:30.276
were shot in the back
of the head and thrown

20:30.312 --> 20:32.915
in the same ditch.
But, at least they were

20:32.916 --> 20:35.382
- together as a family.
- Just like us. [chuckles]

20:35.417 --> 20:37.951
[singsongy]:
Merry Grafelmas.

20:37.986 --> 20:39.319
- Merry Grafelmas!
- Merry Grafelmas!

20:39.354 --> 20:42.055
Oh, guys, I have one more
Grafelnik tradition.

20:42.090 --> 20:44.924
Now, this is for all the things
I've forgotten to take revenge on.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.626
I hope you all enjoy
being stung by

20:46.661 --> 20:49.137
Zephyrianized killer bees!
[bees buzzing]

20:49.599 --> 20:52.399
[Alan, Craig, Edie and Zorn
