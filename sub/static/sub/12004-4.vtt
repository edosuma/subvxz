WEBVTT

00:11.668 --> 00:13.436
Incere.

00:13.470 --> 00:15.571
I get you a job
and it's just another excuse

00:15.606 --> 00:17.673
For you to judge me
and my friends.

00:17.708 --> 00:20.343
- Excellent tongue control, liam.
- What's going on?

00:20.377 --> 00:22.232
<i>- We need a break.
- Daphne: How about this?</i>

00:22.266 --> 00:24.357
- Do you wanna hang out sometime?
- Yeah.

00:24.392 --> 00:27.453
Bay, this is ty.
He's like my big brother.

00:27.487 --> 00:30.596
- Nice to meet you, bay.
- See you around, ty.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:40.566 --> 00:41.631
Thanks.

00:41.665 --> 00:44.465
Okay, so zombies have
taken over the world.

00:44.499 --> 00:47.438
- What's the first thing you do?
- Gather up food and water.

00:47.472 --> 00:50.474
Pfft, wrong.
Go for guns.

00:50.509 --> 00:52.411
What are you
gonna do for food?

00:52.445 --> 00:55.413
I have a gun, remember?
I'll just take yours.

00:57.453 --> 01:01.224
You like zombie movies,
food, sports.

01:01.258 --> 01:03.559
If I even mentioned derrick
rose to my last girlfriend,

01:03.594 --> 01:05.627
All I'd get- eye rolls
and big snorts.

01:05.661 --> 01:07.531
Wait wait wait wait.
Back up.

01:07.565 --> 01:11.634
- What did you say?
- Oh, it always had to be about her and her latest drama.

01:11.669 --> 01:15.340
No no, I mean,
you said last girlfriend.

01:15.374 --> 01:17.275
Does that make me
your current girlfriend?

01:17.309 --> 01:20.179
Uh, yeah.

01:20.214 --> 01:22.381
I mean, I was
kind of hoping so.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.453
Me too.

01:29.524 --> 01:33.427
But in a zombie apocalypse,
you would still take my food?

01:33.462 --> 01:36.463
Oh absolutely.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.335
Honey, just a heads up-
I may have to store

01:42.369 --> 01:44.436
A few things for the
fundraiser in your garage.

01:44.471 --> 01:46.405
What's wrong
with toby's garage?

01:46.439 --> 01:48.339
Well, his band
is playing for the party

01:48.374 --> 01:50.274
And they're gonna need
that space to rehearse.

01:50.309 --> 01:53.443
Buckner hall's too cheap
to spring for a real band?

01:53.478 --> 01:56.212
This is about raising
money, not spending it.

01:56.246 --> 01:57.480
And toby's band is real.

01:57.514 --> 02:00.281
How big of a donation
do I have to make

02:00.316 --> 02:02.450
To get out of going?

02:02.484 --> 02:06.155
Honey, this is
the first time

02:06.190 --> 02:09.592
Everyone will see our
family since everything

02:09.626 --> 02:13.196
And I would like to
present a united front,

02:13.231 --> 02:15.232
Show that we are
a functioning, happy-

02:15.266 --> 02:17.635
So we're a theme park now?

02:20.305 --> 02:22.574
- Um, regina?
- Oh hey.

02:22.608 --> 02:24.476
You know we're hosting
the benefit

02:24.510 --> 02:27.379
For bay and toby's school
here this weekend, right?

02:27.413 --> 02:30.216
- Um- - it's a bunch of rich
people getting dressed up

02:30.250 --> 02:33.285
And forcing other rich people to give
money to a school that's already rich.

02:33.319 --> 02:36.456
- It's for scholarships.
- Well, don't worry. I won't be in your way.

02:36.491 --> 02:38.392
No no.
I want you to come.

02:38.426 --> 02:42.396
- Oh.
- You and daphne and adriana.

02:42.430 --> 02:46.200
Um, well, my mom's away
visiting her sister.

02:46.234 --> 02:48.669
And you know, maybe if you
gave us your social calendar,

02:48.704 --> 02:50.538
We could
coordinate better.

02:50.573 --> 02:55.210
I know it's last minute, but it would
mean a lot to me if you could come.

02:55.244 --> 02:57.412
Just give her the
united front speech, mom.

02:58.614 --> 03:02.250
Oh, daphne, I was just
inviting you and your mother

03:02.284 --> 03:04.552
To the big fundraiser we're
having on Saturday night.

03:04.586 --> 03:07.387
- Fundraiser?
- Yeah, it's gonna be a lot of fun.

03:07.422 --> 03:09.456
- Toby's band is gonna play.
- We'd love to.

03:09.490 --> 03:10.557
- Ay.
- Oh good.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.392
Can I invite my boyfriend?

03:12.426 --> 03:15.494
Oh, I didn't know
you had a boyfriend.

03:15.529 --> 03:18.564
- Neither did I.
- We just made it official tonight.

03:18.598 --> 03:22.167
Well, give me his name and
I'll put it on the guest list.

03:22.201 --> 03:24.302
Liam- liam lupo.

03:42.637 --> 03:44.438
How could she
be dating liam?

03:44.473 --> 03:48.509
I met him when I visited bay's school.

03:48.543 --> 03:51.412
- Who is liam?
- Bay's boyfriend.

03:52.681 --> 03:54.415
Bay's boyfriend.

03:54.449 --> 03:57.585
- Bay's boyfriend?
- What?

03:57.620 --> 04:00.388
- He never said he was going out with you.
- We're not anymore.

04:00.423 --> 04:03.692
- You broke up with liam
- that is not the point, mom.

04:03.727 --> 04:05.561
You're dating someone
from my school

04:05.595 --> 04:08.264
And you didn't think that
before now?H mentioning

04:08.299 --> 04:09.599
But I didn't
wanna mention it

04:09.634 --> 04:11.535
Until I knew it was
something serious.

04:11.570 --> 04:13.737
And I didn't realize that
I needed your permission.

04:13.772 --> 04:16.307
If I was dating someone
from your school,

04:16.341 --> 04:18.642
I'd probably think
to tell you about it.

04:18.677 --> 04:20.644
So liam's never even
brought up my name?

04:20.678 --> 04:23.682
No, he just said he had
an ex-girlfriend.

04:23.716 --> 04:26.685
What did he say about me?

04:26.719 --> 04:30.722
- That bad, huh?
Work this all out, right?

04:30.757 --> 04:32.558
No, mom.
It's cool, it's fine.

04:32.592 --> 04:35.294
It doesn't matter.
Liam and I have broken up.

04:35.328 --> 04:37.530
And besides, I'm dating
someone new now.

04:37.564 --> 04:39.698
- Who?
- His name's ty.

04:39.733 --> 04:43.302
<i>- My ty?
- No. My ty.</i>

04:43.336 --> 04:44.803
Oh god.

04:49.475 --> 04:51.776
<i>- You have to come.
- Ty: A bunch of rich people,</i>

04:51.811 --> 04:54.579
Me in a suit,
meeting your parents?

04:54.614 --> 04:57.416
- You've already met them.
Moving furniture. N I was

04:57.450 --> 04:59.451
This is me dating
their daughter.

04:59.485 --> 05:00.685
They're gonna love you,

05:00.720 --> 05:02.521
Especially when you're
all handsome in your suit.

05:04.323 --> 05:07.326
Look, I like you, okay?

05:07.360 --> 05:09.427
And I really like
spending time with you,

05:09.462 --> 05:11.530
But that's just really not
my scene, all right?

05:11.564 --> 05:13.731
Fine.

06:20.336 --> 06:22.403
For the record,
I had no idea

06:22.438 --> 06:24.272
Who daphne was
when I asked her out.

06:24.306 --> 06:26.508
Really?
You're sticking with that?

06:26.542 --> 06:29.310
You didn't hear how bay
with a deaf girl?Irth

06:29.344 --> 06:30.644
Obviously if I had heard,

06:30.679 --> 06:33.314
I would have figured out
that daphne was that girl.

06:33.349 --> 06:35.549
I'm not an idiot.
In kansas citygirls

06:35.584 --> 06:37.318
Do you think have toured
buckner hall?

06:37.352 --> 06:38.586
Oh, you tell me.

06:38.620 --> 06:41.688
- You've apparently
- shh! Them all.

06:41.723 --> 06:44.625
If I talk any lower,
to listen in. Able

06:44.659 --> 06:46.593
Sorry.

06:46.628 --> 06:48.628
Look, I'm sorry
if I'm not up to date

06:48.663 --> 06:50.463
On the latest
mission hills gossip.

06:50.498 --> 06:53.299
- Well, now you are.
To do, bay?U want me

06:53.333 --> 06:54.567
- Break up with her?
- Yeah.

06:54.601 --> 06:56.401
That's crazy.
I'm not breaking up with her

06:56.436 --> 06:57.736
Just because you have
a problem with her.

06:57.770 --> 06:59.737
Then why did you ask?

07:02.508 --> 07:05.277
Not even dating
and we're still fighting.

07:07.647 --> 07:11.349
I need you to be my plus one
for kathryn's fundraiser.

07:15.354 --> 07:17.355
That was easy.

07:23.295 --> 07:24.729
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:24.763 --> 07:26.698
- Hi.
- Hey.

07:40.747 --> 07:42.648
Dinner smells great.

07:56.529 --> 07:59.431
I haven't met him yet.

07:59.466 --> 08:01.400
You'll meet him
at the fundraiser.

08:01.434 --> 08:04.336
<i>He's my date.
And he very cute.</i>

08:05.705 --> 08:07.705
<i>Regina:
Such a good idea-</i>

08:07.739 --> 08:09.373
Going with him.

08:09.407 --> 08:11.441
He's gonna be there anyway.
His dad's catering.

08:11.476 --> 08:15.378
I understand, but maybe
give it some space

08:15.412 --> 08:17.347
Till things cool down.

08:32.529 --> 08:35.698
All right, fine.
We won't go together.

08:39.336 --> 08:41.470
So what are we, crazy?

08:41.505 --> 08:44.406
We're inviting
to our house,now

08:44.440 --> 08:47.376
Knowing full well
staring at us. Be

08:47.410 --> 08:51.446
And meanwhile our girls
are fighting over some boys.

08:54.483 --> 08:57.317
Could you pour me
one of those?

08:57.352 --> 08:58.652
<i>This is for you.</i>

09:01.522 --> 09:04.357
Sweetie,
we're gonna be fine.

09:04.392 --> 09:06.426
We just gotta keep
our game faces on.

09:06.460 --> 09:08.328
And if people start
asking questions,

09:08.363 --> 09:10.531
We just tell them
we're trying to move forward,

09:10.565 --> 09:13.367
Taking things
one day at a time.

09:13.401 --> 09:14.702
Coraline brightman
just called.

09:14.736 --> 09:17.471
Apparently her mother
invited a reporter

09:17.506 --> 09:19.640
From the "kansas city herald"
to the party-

09:19.674 --> 09:21.609
The "lifestyle" section.

09:21.644 --> 09:24.379
Oh.

09:24.413 --> 09:27.449
- Oh.
- Yeah.

09:27.483 --> 09:29.518
'cause all we need now
is more pressure

09:29.553 --> 09:31.487
To look like the perfect
happy family.

10:17.248 --> 10:19.183
Nothing can save
this dress.

10:21.252 --> 10:24.021
I thought you loved
this dress.

10:24.055 --> 10:27.158
I did, when I wore it to
the last five quinceaneras.

10:27.192 --> 10:30.260
I wish I had
something more elegant.

10:30.295 --> 10:32.963
You mean expensive.

10:32.998 --> 10:35.066
You never cared
about labels before.

10:35.100 --> 10:37.402
I've never been invited to
something like this before.

10:39.238 --> 10:43.107
Other kids might need
expensive clothes

10:43.142 --> 10:48.246
To look beautiful...
But you don't.

11:20.380 --> 11:23.916
- They're bringing up another case of champagne.
- Yes, ma'am.

11:23.951 --> 11:27.887
- Toby, your band is all set up, right?
- Ready to rock and roll, mom.

11:27.922 --> 11:30.223
Oh, bay,
you look beautiful.

11:30.258 --> 11:32.025
Not that anyone
but you will notice.

11:32.060 --> 11:34.194
Oh, honey, I'm sorry
your friend couldn't come.

11:34.228 --> 11:37.964
But considering he's 19,
I'm not that sorry.

11:37.998 --> 11:40.166
I still hope you have
a good time.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.901
- How are things going with- -
things are fine with me and daphne.

11:42.936 --> 11:45.003
Good.

11:48.975 --> 11:52.044
Daphne!
You look beautiful.

11:55.415 --> 11:59.151
- And- and so do you.
- Thank you. So do you.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.860
Ladies, photo opportunity.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.862
- No.
- I'm sorry, I-

12:09.897 --> 12:12.899
- Let's get some water.
- Girls: No.

12:19.006 --> 12:20.907
Game face.

12:22.209 --> 12:25.245
<i>d it's been a while
since I've seen your face d</i>

12:25.279 --> 12:29.049
<i>d got a little lost
in a serious race d</i>

12:29.083 --> 12:30.984
<i>d took me to the top... d</i>

12:31.018 --> 12:34.321
Hello, sue, allen!
Come in.

12:34.355 --> 12:36.990
- Hi.
- You look beautiful.

12:37.025 --> 12:38.325
Thank you.

12:38.359 --> 12:40.360
And so brave.

12:42.997 --> 12:45.232
Oh hi!

13:01.950 --> 13:06.053
Um, maybe I should change.

13:06.087 --> 13:08.054
What happened to not
caring about labels?

13:08.089 --> 13:10.991
Well, it's fancier
than I thought.

13:48.228 --> 13:51.296
What does that even mean?

14:02.375 --> 14:04.943
Hey, so if bay's
not really your sister,

14:04.978 --> 14:07.012
You could totally take
a run at that.

14:07.046 --> 14:09.214
Uh, no.

14:09.249 --> 14:11.984
- Then you mind if I do?
- Yes.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.252
Shouldn't you guys
be playing?

14:13.286 --> 14:14.987
Or are these instruments
just for show?

14:15.021 --> 14:16.288
Our drummer bailed.

14:16.323 --> 14:19.191
Yeah, his mom found porn
on his computer.

14:19.225 --> 14:22.027
- He's grounded.
- I'm texting every drummer I know.

14:22.062 --> 14:24.130
- I know a drummer.
- You do?

14:24.164 --> 14:26.132
Yeah. Emmett.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.267
- Uh, deaf emmett?
- No- blind emmett.

14:28.302 --> 14:30.069
Well, honestly
that would be better

14:30.103 --> 14:31.904
Because at least
he could hear the songs.

14:31.938 --> 14:33.238
Emmett's a really
good drummer.

14:33.272 --> 14:36.274
No offense, but are you
really the best judge of that?

14:36.309 --> 14:38.944
I-

14:38.978 --> 14:40.379
Sound is vibration.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.380
You can feel the rhythm
in your body.

14:42.415 --> 14:45.217
But if you guys have
another option, feel free.

14:45.251 --> 14:49.054
Uh, call him.

14:49.088 --> 14:51.089
Please.

14:52.191 --> 14:54.259
Hey, how about
that sister?

14:56.162 --> 14:58.029
No.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.331
Kathryn:
No, we had no idea.

14:59.365 --> 15:01.867
We just thought that bay
got her coloring

15:01.901 --> 15:03.969
From an italian
on my side of the family.

15:04.003 --> 15:05.370
Look, we thought
it was nothing,

15:05.404 --> 15:09.007
But the genetic test confirmed
that bay wasn't biologically ours.

15:09.041 --> 15:13.010
And that's when we found out that
there had been a mix-up at the hospital.

15:13.045 --> 15:15.279
<i>definitely.</i>

15:15.313 --> 15:17.314
No, we are suing them
big time.

15:17.348 --> 15:21.884
But the important thing is that we're
all getting a chance to know each other.

15:21.919 --> 15:24.187
Now have you all visited
the silent auction?

15:24.221 --> 15:27.289
Because there is an aspen ski
trip that even I have my eye on.

15:27.324 --> 15:31.126
So you really couldn't tell
it wasn't your baby?

15:31.160 --> 15:33.229
Well, obviously
if I had known,

15:33.263 --> 15:36.899
I would have pointed
it out at the time.

15:36.934 --> 15:38.902
<i>Cheers.</i>

15:38.936 --> 15:41.905
So they're still trying to figure out
who's gonna play me in the tv movie.

15:41.939 --> 15:43.240
There's been talk
of emma roberts,

15:43.274 --> 15:45.308
But personally I'm holding
out for camilla belle-

15:45.343 --> 15:48.212
Much more
of a built-in audience.

15:48.246 --> 15:50.914
And zac efron's gonna play
my brother toby.

15:50.949 --> 15:53.350
Oh my god. I just met
daphne. She's so cool.

15:53.384 --> 15:55.318
But I don't understand.

15:55.353 --> 15:58.154
How come she doesn't
look like you?

15:58.189 --> 16:00.323
You do know the difference
between switched at birth

16:00.357 --> 16:02.157
And separated
at birth, right?

16:10.299 --> 16:13.067
Oh hey.
Thanks for coming, man.

16:13.102 --> 16:16.939
- This is emmett.
- Hey.

16:22.980 --> 16:25.116
What did he say?

16:25.150 --> 16:28.019
He's just excited to play
with a real band.

16:33.192 --> 16:37.362
- Hey, can I talk to you?
- Yeah, sure.

16:57.316 --> 16:59.016
Ready?

17:03.355 --> 17:06.925
Please come, I'm begging you.
This party is so lame.

17:06.959 --> 17:09.227
Not exactly a compelling case
for me to show up.

17:09.261 --> 17:11.128
I'm serious, okay?

17:11.163 --> 17:13.164
You don't even have to
wear a suit. Just come.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.932
Look, I don't think
you're really getting

17:14.967 --> 17:16.867
The whole I-don't-want-
to-be-there thing.

17:16.901 --> 17:19.036
Trust me, nobody wants to
be here. You'll fit right in.

17:19.069 --> 17:22.138
Why is it so important
for me to go to this?

17:22.173 --> 17:26.076
Never mind. It's not a big
deal. I'll talk to you later.

17:32.016 --> 17:34.151
I'm gonna steal
a dance with you.

17:34.185 --> 17:37.221
You know that, right?

17:37.255 --> 17:40.992
Look, I know there's been a lot
of craziness going on lately,

17:41.026 --> 17:44.129
But I want you to know
that I really like you.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.266
I like you too.

17:50.103 --> 17:52.905
I feel like this is where
we should kiss now.

17:52.939 --> 17:55.941
you thought dancing
was a bad idea.

17:55.975 --> 17:59.111
Maybe I should go.

17:59.145 --> 18:02.914
- Kiss you later?
- Yeah, kiss you later.

18:06.318 --> 18:09.119
- Yo, liam.
- Oh hey, zane. What's up?

18:09.153 --> 18:12.189
Hey, zane, dan, joe,
this is daphne my girlfriend.

18:12.223 --> 18:14.992
Hi. Nice to meet you.

18:43.022 --> 18:44.990
Unbelievable.

18:45.024 --> 18:48.927
Is the whole freakin' world
in love with her?

18:58.064 --> 19:01.166
Um, it's pretty basic-

19:01.201 --> 19:04.236
Four-on-the-floor
mid-tempo rocker.

19:07.307 --> 19:10.041
This is gonna be
a disaster.

19:10.076 --> 19:11.376
Hey, guys,
how's it going?

19:11.411 --> 19:14.179
<i>We are guitar face.</i>

19:14.213 --> 19:18.417
And I promise you this
is gonna be interesting.

20:46.375 --> 20:49.243
I don't think I've seen you at
one of these fundraisers before.

20:49.277 --> 20:52.446
- Mm, that's because it's my first.
- Oh.

20:52.481 --> 20:55.316
Bet you won't make
that mistake again.

20:56.418 --> 20:59.286
- Bruce.
- Regina.

20:59.320 --> 21:01.221
Regina.

21:01.255 --> 21:03.457
So you're a- you're a new
buckner parent, huh?

21:03.491 --> 21:07.460
No. Buckner is a few zeroes
out of my price range.

21:07.495 --> 21:10.297
Yeah, tuition is ridiculous.

21:10.332 --> 21:12.400
I've got two kids
enrolled now.

21:12.434 --> 21:16.071
But hey, you can't put a price
on a good education, right?

21:16.105 --> 21:18.306
Really? The brochure
listed it at 30 grand.

21:18.341 --> 21:21.376
Well, that's just
the sticker price.

21:21.411 --> 21:24.246
Your kid have good
grades, good at sports?

21:24.280 --> 21:26.415
- Both actually.
- Oh.

21:26.449 --> 21:28.384
You know, there are
scholarships.

21:28.418 --> 21:30.185
That's what this night
is about.

21:30.219 --> 21:34.256
- Well, that and dancing.
- Mm.

21:34.291 --> 21:36.425
What do you say?

21:36.460 --> 21:39.328
Um... Okay.

21:39.363 --> 21:41.264
Great.

21:48.204 --> 21:51.105
Oh, tracy, that was
an amazing donation.

21:51.140 --> 21:53.108
- Thank you.
- I don't buy it.

21:53.142 --> 21:55.076
I mean, I'm sure
john had an affair.

21:55.110 --> 21:56.511
He was a baseball player,
you know?

21:56.545 --> 22:00.181
And come on, what kind of
mother doesn't know her own baby?

22:01.417 --> 22:04.486
- Hey.
- Well, this seems to be going well.

22:04.520 --> 22:07.089
Yeah, for some people.

22:07.123 --> 22:10.358
My ex seems to be hitting
it off with your regina.

22:10.393 --> 22:12.527
<i>My regina?</i>

22:21.136 --> 22:23.505
I'm sure she's just drumming
up business for her salon.

22:23.539 --> 22:25.541
Hmm.

22:33.483 --> 22:35.484
ah.

22:35.518 --> 22:37.453
Hello.
Hi, everybody.

22:37.487 --> 22:39.388
I hope you're having
a wonderful evening.

22:39.422 --> 22:43.192
I just wanted to remind you
that the silent auction

22:43.227 --> 22:45.128
Is open throughout
the evening.

22:45.162 --> 22:48.230
And I wanted to thank
my husband john

22:48.265 --> 22:51.401
For graciously donating
two items up for bid:

22:51.435 --> 22:55.239
One of his precious jerseys
and a year's worth

22:55.273 --> 22:58.142
Of free detailing
at kennish car wash.

22:58.176 --> 23:00.144
<i>John, take a bow.</i>

23:00.178 --> 23:01.412
Honey?

23:04.116 --> 23:07.118
John? Heh.

23:07.152 --> 23:09.220
You're gonna bid
that up, aren't you?

23:09.254 --> 23:11.322
Excuse me,
what is that?

23:11.356 --> 23:13.190
Do you know what
you're looking at?

23:13.224 --> 23:15.325
That is the jersey I wore
when I fought roger clemens.

23:15.359 --> 23:17.527
See the spot
where he hit me?

23:20.264 --> 23:22.031
That's because
there isn't one,

23:22.065 --> 23:24.166
Because I decked him
before he landed a punch.

23:24.201 --> 23:25.434
I hate that guy.

23:25.468 --> 23:27.503
You would not believe
how many guys in the league

23:27.537 --> 23:31.173
Bought me drinks after that,
including guys on his own team.

23:31.208 --> 23:33.510
- Really?
- No kidding. Listen to this.

23:33.544 --> 23:37.414
We were in texas one time and he
was pitching and I was batting...

24:17.257 --> 24:19.525
Thank you!
Whoo!

24:21.395 --> 24:24.397
- Unreal.
- Dude, how do you say "that was great"?

24:24.432 --> 24:27.501
Damn right, man.
Awesome!

24:32.140 --> 24:36.410
So you were really great up there
and your band sounded amazing and...

24:49.090 --> 24:51.091
Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry.

24:52.260 --> 24:55.062
Just never mind.

24:55.096 --> 24:56.296
I'm gonna go.

24:56.331 --> 24:59.433
But really good job
up there.

24:59.468 --> 25:02.003
It was good.

25:11.414 --> 25:13.215
- Hi.
- Hi, mom.

25:13.249 --> 25:15.083
I saw you dancing
with that hot guy.

25:15.117 --> 25:17.453
Yeah, and I saw you
dancing with liam.

25:17.487 --> 25:20.089
What's one dance?

25:20.124 --> 25:22.158
The whole reason
we moved in

25:22.193 --> 25:24.494
Is so you could have a
relationship with these people.

25:24.529 --> 25:28.064
One dance with liam and I'm
putting everything in jeopardy?

25:28.098 --> 25:29.499
I don't know.

25:29.533 --> 25:31.500
But are you willing
to risk it?

25:42.755 --> 25:44.856
My goodness, this is
more than generous.

25:44.890 --> 25:46.924
Thank you so much.

25:56.869 --> 25:59.771
- Kathryn.
- Regina, oh.

25:59.805 --> 26:02.574
I'm so glad that
you're having fun.

26:02.608 --> 26:04.742
And, um, I'm glad
you brought melody.

26:04.777 --> 26:08.446
She seems very-
very sociable.

26:08.480 --> 26:11.783
Um, you have nothing
to worry about.

26:11.817 --> 26:13.618
She's happily married.

26:13.652 --> 26:17.455
Oh, I wasn't
implying anything.

26:17.490 --> 26:19.491
I- I wanted to talk
to you about bruce.

26:19.525 --> 26:21.426
I saw you dancing
with him.

26:21.461 --> 26:24.530
And between you and me,
he's denise's ex

26:24.564 --> 26:27.566
And he comes
with a lot of baggage.

26:27.600 --> 26:29.401
It sounds like
he got rid of it.

26:29.435 --> 26:31.537
Trust me, regina,
he's bad news.

26:31.571 --> 26:34.807
Bad news for me
or for you?

26:34.841 --> 26:37.676
Both of us actually.

27:25.428 --> 27:28.730
- Hi.
- Hi. Hey.

27:33.502 --> 27:36.571
- All right, take care.
- Keep up the bidding.

27:36.606 --> 27:38.840
Where have you been?

27:38.875 --> 27:41.577
I'm guessing whatever answer I
give you will be the wrong one?

27:41.611 --> 27:43.445
I think you should
be with me

27:43.480 --> 27:44.780
And not off with
your basketball friend.

27:44.815 --> 27:47.717
What, melody?
Are you kidding me?

27:47.751 --> 27:49.820
John, I never asked you
any questions

27:49.854 --> 27:51.688
When you were down
in spring training

27:51.723 --> 27:53.457
Or when you were off
on the road.

27:53.492 --> 27:55.793
Whoa whoa, where is this coming from?

27:55.828 --> 27:58.630
But I know how women act
when they're around you.

27:58.664 --> 28:02.434
So when I see melody
hanging all over you

28:02.468 --> 28:04.402
In front of our friends
tonight,

28:04.436 --> 28:06.638
I have to say
I don't like it.

28:06.672 --> 28:08.740
- Hi. Kathryn?
- Hi.

28:08.774 --> 28:10.842
Hi. Tina choi,
"kansas city herald. "

28:10.876 --> 28:13.578
- John kennish. Hi.
- My husband.

28:13.613 --> 28:15.447
- Yeah.
- I'm so glad you're here.

28:15.481 --> 28:18.617
I just met daphne.
What an incredible story.

28:18.651 --> 28:22.521
I mean, to go deaf at that age
and to overcome so much...

28:22.555 --> 28:24.456
Yeah, we're very
very proud of her.

28:24.490 --> 28:27.593
And you- to blend together
two families so seamlessly

28:27.628 --> 28:29.629
And for everyone to get
along so well together-

28:29.663 --> 28:31.698
- Yeah.
- -It's inspiring.

28:31.732 --> 28:35.435
And believe me, by Monday
everybody will be talking about it.

28:44.844 --> 28:47.579
I'm guessing
ty couldn't make it?

28:47.613 --> 28:48.846
More like wouldn't.

28:48.880 --> 28:51.849
Imagine wanting
to miss all this fun.

28:51.883 --> 28:54.485
- Here's to a great party.
- Ah ah.

28:55.620 --> 28:57.822
This drink is not gonna
make it any better.

28:57.856 --> 29:00.825
It can't possibly
make it any worse.

30:52.998 --> 30:55.165
I'm an idiot.

30:55.200 --> 30:58.069
You're gonna have to do
better than that.

31:11.017 --> 31:12.150
You're getting warmer.

31:12.185 --> 31:13.985
I shouldn't have been
hanging out with melody.

31:14.020 --> 31:15.921
I should have been
out here helping you.

31:15.955 --> 31:17.222
It's just that-

31:17.256 --> 31:20.225
Just looking at my jersey
and no one was bidding on it-

31:20.260 --> 31:25.197
Honey, we have been auctioning
off your jerseys for five years.

31:25.231 --> 31:28.201
Anyone who wants one
already has one.

31:28.235 --> 31:31.003
Forget the jersey.

31:31.038 --> 31:34.006
I have never given you
a reason not to trust me

31:34.041 --> 31:37.043
And I'm not
about to start.

31:37.077 --> 31:39.078
All right.

31:39.112 --> 31:41.981
I'm sorry
I snapped at you.

31:42.015 --> 31:46.987
I just can't take all
these rumors and stares.

31:50.958 --> 31:52.892
Well, the only reason
they're staring

31:52.927 --> 31:55.161
Is because you're the
most beautiful woman here.

31:57.965 --> 32:00.200
And the only rumor
I've heard

32:00.234 --> 32:03.036
Is that you're gonna
get lucky tonight.

32:07.108 --> 32:09.877
Really?

32:09.911 --> 32:11.011
Yeah, this whole
switched-at-birth thing

32:11.045 --> 32:13.913
Has actually been
pretty tough on me.

32:15.149 --> 32:18.217
I mean, I was born
in the same hospital.

32:18.251 --> 32:20.019
It could have
happened to me.

32:20.053 --> 32:23.222
Oh my god.
You poor baby.

32:33.936 --> 32:36.170
You enjoying yourself?

32:36.205 --> 32:38.172
Yeah, I'm having
a great time.

32:38.207 --> 32:42.844
- Everyone's been really nice.
- Good.

32:42.879 --> 32:45.180
I'm afraid with this whole
switched-at-birth thing

32:45.214 --> 32:48.082
You might feel like
an exhibit at a zoo.

32:48.117 --> 32:51.986
Thanks, but I'm deaf.

32:52.020 --> 32:54.054
I'm used to people
staring at me.

32:54.089 --> 32:56.223
I know.

32:56.257 --> 33:00.060
- They can be really mean.
- They're just curious.

33:00.094 --> 33:02.862
They want to know
how I deal with it,

33:02.896 --> 33:06.098
So I just do my best to
make them feel comfortable.

33:07.901 --> 33:09.202
Hmm.

33:17.012 --> 33:20.014
hi. Hi, everybody.

33:20.049 --> 33:22.084
I want to thank you all
for coming.

33:22.118 --> 33:24.987
It's your generous support
that has allowed buckner hall

33:25.021 --> 33:28.057
<i>To set the benchmark
for academics,</i>

33:28.091 --> 33:30.293
Athletics and the arts.

33:32.029 --> 33:34.030
This school represents...

33:38.869 --> 33:41.004
It represent-

33:47.244 --> 33:50.147
Uh, it repres-

33:52.884 --> 33:55.052
You know what?

33:55.087 --> 33:59.157
I forgot to introduce
regina vasquez,

33:59.192 --> 34:02.861
Who is the mother
of my husband's love child.

34:05.932 --> 34:08.033
Kidding!

34:09.969 --> 34:12.071
Have you met me? If that
were true, I would never let

34:12.106 --> 34:15.174
<i>This beautiful woman
set foot in my home.</i>

34:16.944 --> 34:18.143
I- I get it.

34:18.178 --> 34:21.179
It's natural to want to
gossip about all this.

34:21.215 --> 34:26.020
And to be honest,
if it were another family,

34:26.054 --> 34:27.955
I'd be right there
with you.

34:27.989 --> 34:32.092
But it's hard, so uh...

34:32.128 --> 34:36.031
I just want to answer the
question you've all been asking.

34:37.199 --> 34:40.135
We're doing just fine.

34:40.170 --> 34:43.907
And to quote
my very wise husband,

34:43.940 --> 34:45.975
We're taking it
one day at a time.

34:46.010 --> 34:50.947
So I want to thank you
for your support and-

34:50.981 --> 34:55.150
Oh, the silent auction closes
in 10 minutes, so get bidding.

34:55.185 --> 34:58.020
And I promise to answer
any other questions you have

34:58.054 --> 35:02.190
About our situation
after you make a donation.

35:02.225 --> 35:06.194
bravo.

35:14.102 --> 35:16.136
Thank you.

35:22.142 --> 35:25.144
- Having fun?
- Not really.

35:25.179 --> 35:29.049
- What more could you want?
- What do you mean?

35:29.083 --> 35:32.987
It sure looked like you were
having an awesome time with liam.

35:33.021 --> 35:36.056
Can I get a copy of that picture
that you took with my family

35:36.091 --> 35:38.859
Or should I just wait for it
to show up above the fireplace?

35:38.894 --> 35:40.861
You act like I'm trying
to steal your life.

35:40.896 --> 35:43.097
Are you? 'cause it sure feels that way.

35:43.131 --> 35:45.132
You know,
this isn't my fault.

35:45.167 --> 35:47.902
It was done to me as much
as it was done to you.

35:47.936 --> 35:49.870
I just have a better
attitude about it.

35:49.905 --> 35:52.907
- Of course you do. You're perfect.
- No, I'm not.

35:52.941 --> 35:56.043
Have you ever been in a
bad mood a day in your life?

35:56.077 --> 35:58.077
Do you want me to apologize
for being nice?

35:58.112 --> 36:00.914
Have you ever tried it?

36:00.948 --> 36:02.949
The minute you found out you
were dating my ex-boyfriend,

36:02.983 --> 36:04.116
You should have
broken up with him.

36:04.151 --> 36:06.085
I may not be anne
of freakin' green gables,

36:06.120 --> 36:08.054
But that's what
I would have done.

36:08.088 --> 36:09.956
Isn't it amazing?

36:09.990 --> 36:11.858
No matter what
the situation is,

36:11.893 --> 36:13.994
You always end up
the victim.

36:14.028 --> 36:18.967
Liam was right
- it always has to be about bay and her drama.

36:20.102 --> 36:23.005
Just so you know,
I may not be good

36:23.039 --> 36:26.242
At school or sports
or being nice,

36:26.276 --> 36:30.045
But I know how to keep
a guy interested.

36:31.915 --> 36:34.283
You should think about that
the next time you're with liam.

36:40.991 --> 36:43.059
It was nice to meet you.

36:46.163 --> 36:48.899
- Hi.
- Hello.

36:48.933 --> 36:51.201
So I just won
dinner for two

36:51.236 --> 36:53.203
At the terrace
in the silent auction,

36:53.238 --> 36:57.174
But I don't usually
enjoy dining alone.

36:57.208 --> 36:59.910
Any interest
in joining me?

36:59.945 --> 37:02.880
You know...

37:02.915 --> 37:06.050
- I would love to.
- But?

37:09.154 --> 37:12.956
No, just that.

37:12.990 --> 37:16.226
- I'd love to.
- Great.

37:36.181 --> 37:38.949
I've waited all night
to do this.

37:44.055 --> 37:48.025
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

37:49.927 --> 37:51.861
It doesn't seem
like nothing.

37:56.066 --> 37:58.200
You know how you said
that you like me

37:58.234 --> 38:01.937
- Because we were into the same stuff?
- Yeah.

38:01.971 --> 38:05.039
Well, if you and bay
didn't watch zombie movies,

38:05.074 --> 38:08.944
Eat fried zucchini or
talk about sports together,

38:08.978 --> 38:11.012
What did you do
all the time?

38:12.214 --> 38:15.850
Honestly,
we mostly fought.

38:15.885 --> 38:17.853
Well then,
why did you go out?

38:17.887 --> 38:19.922
I don't know.

38:19.956 --> 38:21.923
I mean, our parents
were close.

38:21.958 --> 38:23.892
We grew up together.

38:23.926 --> 38:27.028
Look, I don't wanna think
about bay right now.

38:29.098 --> 38:31.099
But I have to.

38:32.201 --> 38:34.936
I don't know
what she is to me.

38:34.971 --> 38:36.871
I don't know
what to call her.

38:36.905 --> 38:39.040
I don't even know
if I like her,

38:39.075 --> 38:42.110
But she is the only person
in the entire planet

38:42.144 --> 38:44.946
Who understands
what I'm going through.

38:44.980 --> 38:47.049
And if I piss her off-

38:48.118 --> 38:51.854
Hey, so let's
figure this out.

38:54.224 --> 38:57.927
There's nothing
to figure out.

38:57.962 --> 39:00.030
Us being together
upsets her.

39:02.901 --> 39:05.136
I wish that
this didn't happen.

39:05.170 --> 39:07.905
I wish that I didn't
have to think about her

39:07.940 --> 39:10.175
Or anyone else,

39:10.209 --> 39:13.945
But I did

39:13.979 --> 39:15.981
And I do.

39:23.190 --> 39:26.191
I like you
so much, liam,

39:26.226 --> 39:29.094
But I have to choose
this family.

39:37.870 --> 39:39.871
Are we breaking up?

39:43.942 --> 39:46.210
I think so.

39:49.181 --> 39:51.983
Are you sure that this
is what you want?

39:52.017 --> 39:53.218
No.

39:58.024 --> 40:00.159
But it's what I'm doing.

40:18.946 --> 40:21.881
What happened?

40:21.915 --> 40:23.916
My jersey sold...

40:23.951 --> 40:25.984
For a lot.

40:26.019 --> 40:27.920
That's great, honey.

40:27.954 --> 40:30.922
And the totals are even better
this year than last year.

40:30.956 --> 40:32.957
Great.

40:32.991 --> 40:36.193
Why don't we kick the rest of
these people out of here early

40:36.227 --> 40:38.195
And go celebrate
in private?

40:38.229 --> 40:40.897
I'll see what I can do.

40:45.168 --> 40:47.270
You know where to find me.

40:51.008 --> 40:53.944
Toby, would you hide this
for me somewhere?

40:53.978 --> 40:56.013
What is it?

40:56.047 --> 40:59.049
Ybought dad's jersey?

40:59.083 --> 41:01.118
- Shh!
- Okay okay.

41:29.049 --> 41:31.018
And you wore a suit.

41:31.052 --> 41:33.986
Yeah, I do own one,
you know?

41:36.122 --> 41:38.257
I'm really glad you came.

41:43.030 --> 41:46.032
Do you, um- you wanna
get the hell out of here?

41:46.066 --> 41:48.200
- Absolutely.
- All right.
