00:56.280 --> 00:57.838
Please, just give her this note.

00:57.920 --> 01:00.912
I'm afraid I have instructions not to
accept any more messages from you.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.036
- I'm sorry.
- But why? I don't understand.

01:03.120 --> 01:04.917
- You can't just...
- I said I'm sorry.

01:05.319 --> 01:06.514
Please excuse me.

01:07.640 --> 01:08.993
Ah, welcome back.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.270
Ah, my good wife, you look splendid.

01:12.760 --> 01:13.829
<i>Merci.</i>

01:14.280 --> 01:15.998
As do you, Monique.

01:17.560 --> 01:20.518
<i>Merci, Roderick.
I so wish for you to join us tonight.</i>

01:20.720 --> 01:24.030
Mmm. Unfortunately I can't, but you two
go ahead and enjoy the performance.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.394
Enjoy.

01:27.640 --> 01:29.073
I forgot my camera.

01:29.160 --> 01:30.195
I told Mr Carlton.

01:30.280 --> 01:32.840
I'll be fast.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.153
Fourth floor, please.

02:05.640 --> 02:07.039
Fourth floor, please.

02:18.160 --> 02:21.436
- Has Monique returned?
- No, ma'am. Is everything all right?

02:27.880 --> 02:32.749
Monique Poirier, age 23, vanished
shortly before 8:00 pm last night.

02:33.160 --> 02:35.879
She's here from France,
visiting her sister Sophie.

02:36.160 --> 02:38.674
Sophie's husband Roderick Dalewood
is the hotel owner.

02:38.760 --> 02:40.478
The Dalewoods live in suite 409.

02:41.360 --> 02:43.635
Detective William Murdoch,
Toronto Constabulary.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.593
Thank you for coming, Detective.

02:45.680 --> 02:47.193
Can you explain the circumstances

02:47.280 --> 02:49.032
leading up to
your sister's disappearance?

02:49.800 --> 02:52.155
We were in the lobby,
leaving for the theatre.

02:52.240 --> 02:55.073
Monique forgot her camera,
so she went up to the suite to get it.

02:56.040 --> 02:57.109
She never came back.

02:57.680 --> 03:00.433
I see.
Do you have a photograph of your sister?

03:01.120 --> 03:02.519
No, I'm afraid not.

03:02.680 --> 03:06.070
Detective.
I found this in the hotel, sir.

03:07.360 --> 03:08.918
That's Monique's purse.

03:09.720 --> 03:11.597
Her compact, keys, film.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.989
Where is her comb? Her pearl comb.

03:15.520 --> 03:17.954
And her camera, it was not in the room.

03:18.040 --> 03:21.715
Well, someone may have found the purse
and stolen any items of value.

03:21.920 --> 03:24.150
George, check with pawnbrokers
and camera shops.

03:24.400 --> 03:25.833
Perhaps someone will try
to sell the items.

03:25.920 --> 03:27.035
Sir.

03:29.040 --> 03:31.918
That's her room key. Suite 409.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.229
And this one?

03:35.080 --> 03:36.672
This is to room 212.

03:41.840 --> 03:44.513
Sir, why would Monique have a key
to a room on the second floor

03:44.600 --> 03:45.874
if she's staying on the fourth?

03:45.960 --> 03:47.359
I don't know, George.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.309
Doesn't seem to be
anything remarkable about this room.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.868
Perhaps. But a key to this room was

03:53.960 --> 03:56.030
in the possession of a woman
that is now missing,

03:56.120 --> 03:58.076
which makes it a room of great interest.

03:58.160 --> 04:01.038
Mmm. If only the walls could talk, sir.

04:12.040 --> 04:15.157
George, please have
Monique's film developed.

04:15.400 --> 04:17.435
It may give us some insight
into her disappearance.

04:17.519 --> 04:18.952
- Sir.
- Thank you.

04:23.440 --> 04:24.839
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

04:24.920 --> 04:26.911
Who rented room 212 last night?

04:27.000 --> 04:29.468
- Uh... No one, sir.
- No one.

04:30.080 --> 04:31.752
When was it last occupied?

04:35.200 --> 04:36.235
May 25th.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.793
That's almost two months ago.

04:39.160 --> 04:40.718
- Yes.
- Thank you.

04:41.360 --> 04:44.033
Uh, you wanted
to see me, Detective?

04:44.120 --> 04:47.032
Yes. You operated
the elevator last night?

04:47.720 --> 04:50.314
By all accounts, you're the last person
to see Monique Poirier.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.558
And that was around 8:00 pm?

04:52.640 --> 04:54.676
Yes, sir, right before
the end of my shift.

04:54.760 --> 04:57.877
I took her to the fourth floor
and then I waited for her,

04:58.360 --> 05:01.397
and then she came back
about a minute later with a camera.

05:01.840 --> 05:04.673
Um, then she asked to be let out
at the second floor.

05:05.840 --> 05:07.273
Did she say why?

05:07.360 --> 05:10.875
Oh, um, it's not my place to ask, sir.

05:11.520 --> 05:12.999
Yes, of course.

05:13.520 --> 05:14.635
Thank you.

05:17.360 --> 05:21.148
Monique went to the second floor?
She knew I was waiting in the lobby.

05:21.680 --> 05:24.353
She had a key to room 212 for a reason.

05:25.040 --> 05:28.749
Mr Dalewood, why is room 212 rented out
so infrequently?

05:29.160 --> 05:32.596
It looks out onto a brick wall.
It's our least desirable room.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.235
Hmm.

05:34.640 --> 05:38.315
Sophie, perhaps the detective would be
interested in the note you found.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.549
I'm sure it's nothing.

05:39.640 --> 05:42.473
There was a man Monique met
on the train from Montreal.

05:43.360 --> 05:45.794
Somehow, he had the notion
that he should call on her.

05:45.880 --> 05:49.190
But Monique made it very clear
she wanted nothing to do with him.

05:49.560 --> 05:50.595
And what was his name?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.719
Hmm. I believe it was David...

05:54.400 --> 05:56.231
Odd. Deletran.

05:56.720 --> 05:59.188
Deletran, what kind
of bloody name is that?

05:59.280 --> 06:00.633
Is he another garlic-eating Frenchy?

06:01.400 --> 06:02.879
I suspect not, sir.

06:02.960 --> 06:05.838
Deletran is
a grammatically incorrect way of saying

06:05.920 --> 06:07.990
"from the train" in French.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.195
He was trying to be clever.

06:09.840 --> 06:12.354
Oh, yes, I forgot.
You speak French, don't you?

06:12.760 --> 06:15.194
Yes, sir. Educated by Jesuits
in New Brunswick.

06:15.320 --> 06:19.154
Right, so this David was trying to be
clever. I can see why she sent him away.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.309
In his note,
he cryptically lists his address

06:22.400 --> 06:25.915
as number 23
on the street of willow trees.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.115
There's a Willow Avenue in the Beach.

06:27.400 --> 06:31.632
Yes, sir, I had it checked. It's owned
by an elderly couple, no David.

06:31.720 --> 06:33.676
What about this hotel room, 212?

06:33.960 --> 06:37.191
<i>Maybe our missing young lady went there
to rendezvous avec David.</i>

06:38.320 --> 06:40.231
It's a possibility...

06:41.160 --> 06:43.594
- Is he here?
- Excuse me, Murdoch.

06:45.760 --> 06:48.149
Sir, I've developed the film
we found in Monique's purse.

06:51.760 --> 06:53.876
Inspector Thomas Brackenreid.

06:54.360 --> 06:55.713
Pleasure, once again.

06:57.040 --> 06:59.076
- Isaac Lowe.
- Isaac.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.637
- Yes, of course. We met at...
- The policemen's charity ball.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.355
Yes. I was slightly
in my cups that night.

07:06.440 --> 07:09.352
Yes, well, you gave one hell
of a speech, impromptu as it was.

07:09.440 --> 07:12.113
You made a favourable impression
on some very well-appointed people.

07:12.680 --> 07:15.956
Well, it's nice of you to say so.
What can I do for you today?

07:16.680 --> 07:18.875
I have a proposition for you, Inspector.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.319
Follow me, Isaac.

07:27.120 --> 07:29.554
It would seem Sophie was taking Monique
on a tour of the city.

07:29.640 --> 07:32.552
Yes but, unfortunately,
the camera was never turned on Monique.

07:32.640 --> 07:33.993
It would be helpful
if we had a photograph

07:34.080 --> 07:35.433
to distribute to the other stations.

07:35.520 --> 07:36.919
Mmm.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.153
Ah, here we are
at the hotel, sir.

07:39.240 --> 07:40.275
Hmm.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.472
That's room 212, George.

07:47.920 --> 07:51.071
And, contrary to what we've been told,
it was occupied recently.

07:53.200 --> 07:56.397
I followed a man up here, sir.
He went into 212 using a key.

07:56.480 --> 07:57.799
And you have no idea who he is?

07:57.880 --> 08:01.031
No, sir. He's been skulking around
the hotel asking about Monique.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.115
Toronto Constabulary!

08:17.640 --> 08:20.632
Inspector Marcel Guillaume,
Securité Paris.

08:21.480 --> 08:24.153
<i>Now, get these petits singes
off from me!</i>

08:28.440 --> 08:29.555
Get this what off me?

08:29.920 --> 08:31.831
He just called you
a little monkey, George.

08:32.520 --> 08:35.398
Not just him. You, too, monkey.

08:43.600 --> 08:44.999
Let's do English, please.

08:45.720 --> 08:47.756
Allow me the chance
to massacre your language.

08:50.680 --> 08:52.113
What are you doing here?

08:53.200 --> 08:55.236
<i>I'm commissioned
by monsieur Pierre Poirier</i>

08:55.320 --> 08:57.675
to investigate the vanishing
of his daughter, Monique.

08:58.240 --> 09:00.708
But she only disappeared yesterday.
How could you possibly know...

09:00.800 --> 09:02.233
I was in Montréal

09:02.320 --> 09:05.471
for a conference
on international police cooperation.

09:06.080 --> 09:09.755
And it's clear to me now
there is much work to do.

09:17.240 --> 09:18.355
Hmm.

09:18.880 --> 09:21.110
Miss Monique has
an obsession with room 212.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.077
<i>What did you find there,
monsieur Murdoch?</i>

09:24.160 --> 09:25.832
Nothing in room 212,

09:25.920 --> 09:29.276
but this was apparently written
by a persistent admirer,

09:29.880 --> 09:33.919
and we've determined that
he does not live at 23 Willow Avenue.

09:36.920 --> 09:39.070
<i>I would think not, monsieur Murdoch.</i>

09:46.000 --> 09:48.594
She returned
along the street of willows.

09:48.760 --> 09:50.113
What the bloody hell is he on about?

09:50.200 --> 09:52.316
<i>It's from a song, Rue St-Vincent.</i>

09:52.800 --> 09:55.519
23 St Vincent. George!

09:57.080 --> 09:58.957
I met Monique
on the train from Montreal.

09:59.320 --> 10:00.878
We talked most of the way.

10:01.640 --> 10:03.870
It felt nice talking to her.
She's very pretty.

10:04.440 --> 10:05.475
Hmm.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.833
And you wanted to see her again,
so you gave her your address.

10:08.920 --> 10:11.309
Yeah. I told her where I lived
and she said,

10:11.400 --> 10:13.152
<i>"Oh, just like the song Rue St-Vincent. "</i>

10:14.000 --> 10:15.274
She sang it for me.

10:15.560 --> 10:18.358
But you didn't hear from her,
so you went to find her

10:18.440 --> 10:20.351
at the Queensborough Hotel, Mr Bishop.

10:20.440 --> 10:22.317
How did you know she was staying there?

10:23.000 --> 10:24.558
She asked me to visit.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.630
But then I get word
she wants nothing to do with me.

10:27.720 --> 10:28.789
Made no sense.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.359
Where do you work, David?

10:31.760 --> 10:32.954
At the Kemp Glass Factory.

10:34.400 --> 10:35.833
Glass factory?

10:35.920 --> 10:38.957
And you think a man like you
would interest a woman like Monique?

10:39.800 --> 10:40.869
She is from a good family.

10:42.360 --> 10:43.839
She confided in me.

10:44.760 --> 10:45.875
What about?

10:46.360 --> 10:48.430
She was worried about her sister.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.959
Ever since she moved to Canada, Sophie's
letters to Monique seemed detached.

10:53.760 --> 10:56.149
She thought
the marriage wasn't working out.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.756
And when was the last you saw of her?

10:59.080 --> 11:00.399
At Union Station.

11:00.640 --> 11:04.838
I saw her meet with Sophie,
but it seemed cold.

11:05.880 --> 11:07.393
They didn't even hug.

11:13.520 --> 11:17.354
Oh!
You have an electric car? Very nice.

11:17.440 --> 11:18.793
Yes, thank you.

11:18.880 --> 11:21.758
No, thanks to Gaston Planté
and to Camille Faure,

11:22.240 --> 11:24.117
because, without them,
you have no battery.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.919
No batter, no electric car,
no photo to show.

11:30.480 --> 11:34.837
Mrs Dalewood, if I may,
how is it you came to meet Mr Dalewood?

11:36.080 --> 11:38.799
We met in Paris
when Roderick was there on business.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.352
It was the start of a passionate affair.

11:41.920 --> 11:46.869
We later exchanged letters, and,
within months, I proposed by telegram.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.953
How's that for modern romance?

11:49.400 --> 11:51.277
I sailed for Canada two weeks later.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.275
That was last December.

11:56.200 --> 11:57.269
But...

11:57.760 --> 11:59.796
You are the only one not smiling.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.233
I was sad to board the ship.

12:02.400 --> 12:05.790
Leaving behind my sister and father
to start a new life in Toronto.

12:07.040 --> 12:09.156
How did your marriage affect Monique?

12:09.240 --> 12:11.800
Not well. But it is my fault.

12:12.320 --> 12:16.029
Being so far away, I closed myself
to her, hoping it would hurt less.

12:17.240 --> 12:20.073
And may I see her letters to you?

12:23.360 --> 12:24.634
Oh, forgive me.

12:25.200 --> 12:28.590
I know those are
private words between sisters,

12:29.080 --> 12:32.277
but it will help us understand Monique

12:33.080 --> 12:34.559
and where she might have gone.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.353
"My dear Sophie,

12:40.160 --> 12:41.912
"it has been so long
since you've written,

12:43.440 --> 12:45.715
"and your last letter was so brief.

12:46.760 --> 12:49.718
"I'm worried that something is wrong.
Is it?

12:51.120 --> 12:52.792
"Please, tell me. "

12:55.000 --> 12:56.991
"Dear Sophie, only a telegram.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.878
"Are you angry with me?

13:00.400 --> 13:04.678
"Or are you unhappy with Roderick
and ashamed to tell me?"

13:05.040 --> 13:09.750
A woman bears her heart
and you read her words like a newspaper.

13:11.920 --> 13:13.148
"I am coming to visit.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.839
"Please don't try to talk me out of it.

13:17.760 --> 13:19.079
"I love you

13:19.880 --> 13:21.359
"and I must see you. "

13:23.040 --> 13:26.919
Well, whatever her concerns were,
they seem to have been allayed.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.798
By all accounts, their visit
brought them closer together.

13:29.880 --> 13:31.711
She probably didn't just run away.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.115
Yeah.

13:52.840 --> 13:54.592
You're here quite late, sir.

13:54.840 --> 13:56.751
Just weighing up my options, Murdoch.

13:58.680 --> 14:02.309
I've been asked to stand as candidate
for alderman in the next elections.

14:02.720 --> 14:04.392
- How about that?
- Indeed?

14:04.480 --> 14:06.357
My backers have deep pockets.

14:06.440 --> 14:10.194
They're looking for someone
to uphold our shared values, etc., etc.

14:11.240 --> 14:12.275
And what's their agenda?

14:12.920 --> 14:14.114
Agenda?

14:14.560 --> 14:18.269
I assume they're looking for a man
of law and order to clean up this city.

14:19.160 --> 14:20.388
What else do they want, sir?

14:21.600 --> 14:23.795
Well... What else could there be?

14:25.200 --> 14:26.838
That's a very good question.

14:27.520 --> 14:30.239
Uh, excuse me,
I need to see the detective.

14:30.320 --> 14:32.276
- It's very important...
- Excuse me.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.230
Detective Murdoch, I saw her. Monique.

14:38.560 --> 14:42.155
In the East End. She was on the corner
of Queen Street and Broadview.

14:42.520 --> 14:44.317
Are you quite certain it was her?

14:44.400 --> 14:46.755
I mean, her hair was blonde
and her clothes were different,

14:46.840 --> 14:48.990
but I'm sure it was her.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.149
Hmm.

14:57.280 --> 15:00.829
The desk clerk saw the woman,
presumably Monique Poirier,

15:00.920 --> 15:02.273
crossing at Queen and Broadview.

15:02.600 --> 15:05.910
Do we have a photograph of Monique
to show people in this area?

15:06.280 --> 15:09.272
No, and it would take weeks
for one to reach us from France.

15:10.080 --> 15:12.150
Actually, sir, I may have an idea.

15:12.600 --> 15:15.637
It's possible Monique's father could
wire us a photograph.

15:15.720 --> 15:17.676
But a telegram is for words.

15:18.200 --> 15:21.795
Yes, telegraphs transmit dots
and dashes, which represent letters.

15:22.280 --> 15:24.919
But they could easily represent
any values we assign to them.

15:25.920 --> 15:28.480
- Values?
- Yes, let me demonstrate.

15:29.200 --> 15:33.079
Any picture is simply a collection
of shapes and shadows,

15:33.360 --> 15:36.875
the components of which can be
broken down to individual units.

15:37.360 --> 15:40.557
All we have to do is assign each unit
a numeric value,

15:40.640 --> 15:43.712
according to
where it falls on a grey scale.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.836
Yes, sir, I see how the picture can be
converted to numbers,

15:45.920 --> 15:48.229
but how do we
convert numbers to a picture?

15:48.680 --> 15:51.353
We paint in each square, or unit.

15:51.720 --> 15:53.312
How many do we need?

15:53.680 --> 15:55.989
Eighty squares across
and down should suffice.

15:56.240 --> 15:57.958
Sir, that would be a total of...

15:58.360 --> 16:01.193
6400 squares, each square painted

16:01.280 --> 16:03.555
at a rate of approximately
10 seconds a square,

16:03.640 --> 16:06.871
that would amount to
20 hours of painting.

16:07.960 --> 16:10.758
Uh, George, perhaps Constable Higgins
should assist you on this.

16:11.320 --> 16:12.753
An excellent idea, sir.

16:17.120 --> 16:20.271
Inspector Brackenreid,
this is Mr Edwin Drury.

16:20.360 --> 16:22.430
Mr Drury heads
the consortium of individuals

16:22.520 --> 16:24.670
who'll be financing your campaign.

16:24.760 --> 16:25.909
Pleased to meet you.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.834
Isaac says you're a man with personal
appeal, a man who can win elections.

16:29.920 --> 16:32.229
What we need to know is
what kind of alderman you'll make.

16:32.320 --> 16:33.594
A good one, I hope.

16:33.680 --> 16:35.079
I keep abreast of the issues,

16:35.200 --> 16:37.634
I'm familiar
with the workings of city government,

16:37.720 --> 16:38.835
and, as a man of law and order,

16:38.920 --> 16:42.310
I'm prepared to do
what's necessary to clean up this city.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.118
What's your view
on the proposed subway project?

16:44.720 --> 16:46.870
Subway. I, uh...

16:47.560 --> 16:48.993
Haven't given it much thought.

16:49.320 --> 16:52.517
But, as a police inspector, my focus
has been on the streets, not below them.

16:52.720 --> 16:55.871
Well, of course your experience in law
enforcement is of great interest to us,

16:55.960 --> 16:59.077
but this is the future of the city.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.512
Boston just opened their subway.
Paris is building one.

17:02.840 --> 17:05.273
A world-class city requires
a world-class subway.

17:05.560 --> 17:09.838
Imagine an electrified railway running
underneath Queen Street

17:10.240 --> 17:13.789
whisking people from one end of the city
to the other in a matter of minutes.

17:15.040 --> 17:16.473
That would definitely
put Toronto on the map.

17:16.560 --> 17:18.710
I'm glad you agree,
because our consortium is

17:18.800 --> 17:20.756
very keen on seeing
the subway proposal approved.

17:20.920 --> 17:23.194
It's set to come to a vote
after the elections.

17:23.280 --> 17:24.872
Currently,
the council is split on the issue.

17:25.560 --> 17:27.357
We're hoping
that your vote will carry the day,

17:27.440 --> 17:30.159
as our consortium owns
much of the land involved.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.551
Oh, it's time.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.033
<i>Du vin, monsieur?</i>

17:43.560 --> 17:44.675
<i>Non.</i>

17:47.440 --> 17:50.238
Sirs, we've received word from Paris.

17:51.240 --> 17:54.994
<i>"Nous sommes pleins D apostrophe... "</i>

17:55.080 --> 17:57.036
- George, please.
- Yes.

17:57.760 --> 17:58.795
So...

18:01.720 --> 18:04.314
Oh, good! The father has agreed
to provide a photograph.

18:05.800 --> 18:08.553
La Securité will conduct
the coding and transmission immediately.

18:08.640 --> 18:09.675
Hmm.

18:09.760 --> 18:12.115
So now we have
time for lunch.

18:12.520 --> 18:14.715
Sirs, a body's been found
at Union Station.

18:15.080 --> 18:16.433
- It's a young woman.
- All right.

18:16.520 --> 18:17.589
But...

18:29.400 --> 18:31.311
At first we thought it was a dead rat,

18:31.400 --> 18:34.153
but then we noticed the stench was
coming from this trunk.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.757
That smells
like sulphuric acid.

18:43.320 --> 18:46.232
Inspector Guillaume,
Dr Ogden, our coroner.

18:47.600 --> 18:50.717
<i>Vraiment? I'm very impressed.</i>

18:52.360 --> 18:53.713
That a woman can be a doctor.

18:55.520 --> 18:57.875
That a doctor can be so beautiful.

19:02.800 --> 19:03.915
Well...

19:05.080 --> 19:06.911
Decay has begun, obviously.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.675
I'd say she's been dead
for at least 48 hours.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.712
Someone tried very hard
to conceal her identity.

19:13.280 --> 19:14.713
She had beautiful hair, though.

19:14.800 --> 19:17.633
According to her sister,
Monique has dark brown hair.

19:35.600 --> 19:38.160
The hair is like hers, but the face...

19:39.360 --> 19:40.998
- Did they do this to her when she was...
- No.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.878
She was dead before the acid touched
her hands and face.

19:46.920 --> 19:50.754
Did Monique have any identifying
features on her body? Any birthmarks?

19:50.840 --> 19:53.593
Yes, she had one
on the back of her neck.

19:55.080 --> 19:58.117
That is why she always wore
her hair down, to cover it.

20:02.280 --> 20:03.838
Like this?

20:04.200 --> 20:05.519
That is her.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.515
Monique...

20:10.200 --> 20:11.952
Who could have done this to you?

20:16.000 --> 20:18.150
Do you remember the stakeout we did
of that postal box?

20:18.240 --> 20:21.949
Oh, do I ever. That was
the most boring night of my life.

20:22.560 --> 20:23.709
This is worse.

20:24.920 --> 20:27.036
Really, Higgins? I don't find it so bad.

20:27.480 --> 20:29.914
In fact, I think this could be
a recreational activity.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.355
Think about it.
It allows anybody to be a painter.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.829
You just need to know
which colour to put where.

20:37.320 --> 20:38.435
This is in black and white.

20:38.520 --> 20:41.592
Yes, but it doesn't have to be, Higgins,
and it doesn't have to be squares.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.760
You could have whichever colour you like
in whichever shape you like.

20:45.080 --> 20:49.437
We could call it "paint by numerical
value". We could sell small kits.

20:50.960 --> 20:53.110
Couldn't sell worse
than your adventure novel will.

20:53.200 --> 20:56.237
Oh, that's great, Higgins.
Very, very supportive. Encouraging.

20:58.320 --> 21:00.959
So, how is our long-haired,
cheese-eating pond-hopper?

21:01.720 --> 21:04.951
He's fine, sir. He has a certain
je ne sais quoi.

21:05.680 --> 21:07.989
"Je ne sais quoi. " What does that mean?

21:10.280 --> 21:11.474
I don't know.

21:12.080 --> 21:13.593
So why did you just say it?

21:16.160 --> 21:19.038
Sir, how was your political meeting?

21:19.120 --> 21:20.269
Oh, that. Well...

21:22.160 --> 21:24.469
They want me to champion
their subway proposal.

21:24.560 --> 21:26.949
A subway? Fascinating.

21:27.040 --> 21:31.158
Yes, we've just commenced building
a metro in Paris and it's fantastic!

21:31.840 --> 21:34.718
Well, of course, there is
the cost of the subway to consider.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.995
Right. Well, nothing's free.

21:37.080 --> 21:40.789
Subway construction is very dear.
Heads have rolled because of that.

21:40.880 --> 21:43.394
Yes, I've heard similar stories
coming from Boston.

21:43.960 --> 21:46.428
Right, so what are you saying?
Stay clear of the whole deal?

21:46.520 --> 21:47.999
No, sir. No, sir, not at all.

21:48.080 --> 21:51.038
It's simply an issue of
who do you want to work for.

21:51.760 --> 21:54.877
Are you representing the people
or your backers?

21:55.520 --> 21:56.589
Hmm.

22:00.960 --> 22:04.555
Death was by strangulation, possibly
garrotting with a piece of cloth.

22:04.680 --> 22:07.274
Curiously, her stomach
and small intestines were empty.

22:07.360 --> 22:08.429
She hadn't eaten in days.

22:09.320 --> 22:11.880
She also has urine burns
in her pelvic area.

22:12.720 --> 22:15.553
Suggesting she was tied up
for a prolonged period of time.

22:16.680 --> 22:18.033
Very cruel.

22:24.880 --> 22:26.552
Gentlemen, how are you faring?

22:26.960 --> 22:30.635
Sir, if the woman in the trunk has
already been identified as Monique,

22:30.720 --> 22:32.472
do we really still need the photograph?

22:32.560 --> 22:35.916
Yes, Henry. We need to track
her movements after her disappearance.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.912
Having a photograph could prove to be
quite useful.

22:39.520 --> 22:41.750
Henry, could you turn the...

22:42.480 --> 22:43.549
Sir.

22:51.440 --> 22:52.793
I see two shapes.

22:52.960 --> 22:55.235
Yes, their father gave Securité Paris

22:55.320 --> 22:56.719
a photograph he had taken
on their estate

22:56.800 --> 22:58.279
of both Monique and Sophie.

22:58.600 --> 23:00.477
It was the most recent photograph
he had of Monique.

23:01.280 --> 23:03.510
I see. Thank you, George. Carry on.

23:03.600 --> 23:07.070
Sir. Oh, also, Constable Worsley
telephoned. They traced the trunk.

23:07.160 --> 23:10.391
A porter picked it up early yesterday
morning from the Queensborough.

23:10.480 --> 23:12.869
- Thank you, George. Shall we?
- Ah-huh.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.559
This coroner...

23:25.640 --> 23:27.153
You're in love with her, yes?

23:27.280 --> 23:28.633
I beg your pardon?

23:29.920 --> 23:31.876
<i>Please, monsieur. It is obvious.</i>

23:33.320 --> 23:36.198
The way you sneak glances at her
when she's not looking.

23:36.440 --> 23:38.510
The way she sneaks glances at you...

23:38.600 --> 23:41.751
Ah, well, she's engaged to another man.

23:42.320 --> 23:44.072
Then it is a perfect situation.

23:44.960 --> 23:47.633
- How so?
- Well, she can be your mistress.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.878
My mistress?

23:50.880 --> 23:52.154
<i>Monsieur Murdoch,</i>

23:52.880 --> 23:55.189
<i>le mariage is about family.</i>

23:55.440 --> 23:56.998
You make babies with your wife,

23:58.000 --> 24:00.195
but you make love to your mistress.

24:09.680 --> 24:12.513
We received a telegram asking us
to bring the trunk down to the lobby.

24:13.280 --> 24:15.669
- What time was this?
- About 4:00 am.

24:15.760 --> 24:17.478
The trunk was taken
from what room?

24:17.560 --> 24:18.788
Uh... 214.

24:20.880 --> 24:21.949
Beside room 212.

24:22.520 --> 24:23.635
Yes.

24:43.280 --> 24:44.713
She was tied to this chair.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.035
And gagged.

24:52.120 --> 24:54.270
The smell of ammonia. Urine.

24:59.840 --> 25:01.273
The murder weapon, perhaps?

25:32.760 --> 25:33.795
- Sir.
- Yes?

25:33.880 --> 25:35.472
Who booked room 214?

25:36.040 --> 25:37.075
Oh.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.439
A Mr J. Hill,

25:41.480 --> 25:45.029
paid by mail, postmarked on the 22nd
of this month, but he never checked in.

25:47.160 --> 25:48.275
22nd?

25:48.920 --> 25:51.559
Did he ask for room 214 specifically?

25:51.760 --> 25:55.435
Yes, sir. People sometimes do.
It's one of our less expensive rooms.

25:55.920 --> 25:58.115
Mmm. And when was the trunk delivered?

25:58.640 --> 25:59.675
Uh...

26:00.280 --> 26:01.474
I have no record of that.

26:01.720 --> 26:03.950
I see. Thank you.

26:08.440 --> 26:10.431
- You have news, Dr Ogden?
- Yes.

26:10.800 --> 26:14.509
Monique's murder reminded me of a case
I read about six months ago in Montreal.

26:14.600 --> 26:17.558
I had the coroner's report sent
on the overnight express.

26:17.640 --> 26:20.712
A Jane Doe in her early 20s was found
stuffed into a steamer trunk.

26:21.640 --> 26:24.234
She was also strangled with a cloth.

26:25.280 --> 26:26.508
Just like Monique.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.073
Excellent work, Doctor.

26:31.400 --> 26:32.753
It's good to have you back.

26:33.880 --> 26:35.472
It's good to be wanted back.

26:37.520 --> 26:39.511
And Darcy? He's well, I hope.

26:40.080 --> 26:43.436
Yes, he got a position at the Victoria
Sick Children's Hospital.

26:43.600 --> 26:44.999
Oh. Good.

26:47.680 --> 26:49.910
Very good. Thank you.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.993
Oh, sorry. Sorry,
I didn't get much sleep last night.

27:07.320 --> 27:10.630
Did you get my message about the
unknown woman discovered in Montreal?

27:10.720 --> 27:12.551
Oh, yes, Jane Doe.

27:13.440 --> 27:14.475
Yes.

27:15.440 --> 27:17.635
But I'm confused.

27:17.920 --> 27:20.593
How can she be unknown
if you know her name?

27:21.120 --> 27:24.510
Ah, no, Inspector,
Jane or John Doe are names...

27:29.160 --> 27:30.752
Will I see you tonight?

27:30.880 --> 27:35.510
<i>Well, it will depend on my case, chérie,
but perhaps we'll have dinner.</i>

27:43.280 --> 27:44.508
You were saying?

27:45.320 --> 27:47.231
- That's your wife?
- Oh, no.

27:47.920 --> 27:50.275
Her name is Cecelia.
I met her last night in the hotel.

27:51.320 --> 27:55.677
So, you think Jane Doe and Monique were
murdered by the same man?

27:56.320 --> 27:58.470
Yes, but as I was saying, Jane isn't...

27:58.560 --> 28:00.676
I thought I heard another man's voice.

28:00.840 --> 28:02.558
<i>Good morning, monsieur. I'm Angelique.</i>

28:03.840 --> 28:04.909
<i>Merci.</i>

28:11.600 --> 28:13.591
You met her in the hotel last night
as well?

28:13.760 --> 28:16.035
Oh, no. That is my wife.

28:18.640 --> 28:20.198
I've seen it before.

28:20.400 --> 28:24.757
Men who kill women like this,
they are usually pathetic men.

28:25.240 --> 28:28.596
Infatuated with taking revenge
for what they cannot have.

28:30.560 --> 28:33.199
- And what would that be?
- Love, of course.

28:34.040 --> 28:36.679
Life is a contest, women are the prize.

28:37.360 --> 28:39.635
But some men just try too hard.

28:41.160 --> 28:42.354
Men like David Bishop.

28:42.440 --> 28:45.876
Yes, who is recently arrived
from Montreal.

28:46.920 --> 28:48.911
Jane Doe is from Montreal.

28:49.560 --> 28:51.437
Perhaps he rented out room 214.

28:51.520 --> 28:55.115
He went to visit Monique
and she rejected him

28:55.600 --> 28:58.353
after she led him to believe
she had interest in him.

28:58.680 --> 29:00.636
He must have been very disappointed.

29:01.960 --> 29:06.954
So David Bishop
lured Monique to room 214.

29:08.360 --> 29:10.874
He's done this before.
He has his reasons.

29:13.800 --> 29:17.349
Inspector, David Bishop works
in a glass factory, yes?

29:18.040 --> 29:19.109
Yes.

29:19.200 --> 29:21.873
To make glass,
you need sodium carbonate.

29:21.960 --> 29:24.793
To make sodium carbonate,
you need sulphuric acid.

29:27.440 --> 29:29.032
You went into my apartment?

29:30.080 --> 29:32.196
What is all of this, Mr Bishop?

29:32.520 --> 29:34.875
Art. I make hair jewellery.

29:36.680 --> 29:39.194
Who makes jewellery out of hair?

29:39.640 --> 29:41.870
I do. Isn't it obvious?

29:42.000 --> 29:45.515
No, no, for me it's just very strange.

29:46.560 --> 29:48.198
This one is dark brown.

29:48.280 --> 29:49.679
Yes, it's Monique's.

29:49.760 --> 29:52.797
She has beautiful hair, I asked her
for a lock. It's what I do.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.790
You do this with all your victims?

29:57.560 --> 29:59.516
- Make their hair into little ornaments?
- Victims?

29:59.600 --> 30:00.715
The women you've murdered.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.438
Murdered? Now hold on.

30:02.520 --> 30:05.193
Where did you get
all of the hair for these, Mr Bishop?

30:06.040 --> 30:08.713
From women I've met and from customers.

30:08.800 --> 30:10.153
Customers?

30:10.240 --> 30:12.834
People who want to preserve
the memory of a loved one

30:12.920 --> 30:15.480
in a decorative yet tasteful manner.

30:15.840 --> 30:16.989
They think they're beautiful.

30:18.360 --> 30:19.634
Oh, yes.

30:20.160 --> 30:21.752
Just like Monique. Hmm?

30:22.400 --> 30:23.674
Monique was beautiful, too, no?

30:24.080 --> 30:25.991
What do you... What do you mean, was?

30:27.840 --> 30:30.513
- Monique's dead?
- You know very well she's dead.

30:30.600 --> 30:31.749
You killed her.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.991
Just like you killed that woman
in Montreal.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.753
I did no such thing.

30:36.480 --> 30:38.277
Was she beautiful, too?

30:39.560 --> 30:41.073
Is that why you kill them?

30:41.160 --> 30:44.436
Because their beauty taunts you
and you cannot have them?

30:47.320 --> 30:51.074
Mr Bishop, where were you
between the 5th and the 16th of March?

30:51.840 --> 30:53.114
Montreal, perhaps?

30:54.320 --> 30:57.676
I was in Moncton visiting my family.

31:02.760 --> 31:05.797
This telegram confirms
that David Bishop was in Moncton

31:05.880 --> 31:08.155
when Jane Doe was murdered in Montreal.

31:10.880 --> 31:14.270
Who else has access
to this sulphuric acid?

31:14.360 --> 31:17.716
Sulphuric acid is found in fertilisers,
batteries...

31:18.280 --> 31:19.759
Roderick Dalewood.

31:20.080 --> 31:22.310
Yes? He owns an electric car.

31:24.120 --> 31:25.314
Electric car...

31:25.800 --> 31:29.839
No, no, no. What motive would he have
for murdering his wife's sister?

31:30.560 --> 31:33.199
Monique was angry that Roderick
was to marry Sophie.

31:33.280 --> 31:34.429
That's not enough.

31:35.640 --> 31:39.952
Sirs. A pawnbroker just turned this in.
It was sold to him yesterday.

31:41.360 --> 31:42.839
A pocket camera.

31:43.440 --> 31:45.510
The same camera used by Monique, no?

31:45.600 --> 31:46.749
Yes.

31:47.920 --> 31:49.273
There's film in it.

31:50.760 --> 31:53.513
You develop
your own photographs? Impressive.

32:00.760 --> 32:02.910
Well, well, well.

32:04.120 --> 32:08.830
Sophie's husband enjoying
the love that dare not speak its name.

32:11.120 --> 32:13.156
- It's a crime here, yes?
- Yes.

32:13.240 --> 32:14.559
And, by taking this photograph,

32:14.640 --> 32:17.473
Monique gave Roderick
ample motivation for murder.

32:24.680 --> 32:25.715
<i>Mon dieu.</i>

32:25.800 --> 32:29.588
You claimed to have
a torrid sexual affair with this man,

32:30.680 --> 32:32.033
who clearly prefers men.

32:32.160 --> 32:34.720
What exactly is the nature
of your marriage?

32:39.200 --> 32:41.714
It was an arrangement
of mutual interest.

32:42.480 --> 32:45.119
He didn't want sexual relations
and neither did I.

32:46.360 --> 32:48.635
He placed an ad
and we exchanged letters.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.197
So the story of your whirlwind romance
was a fabrication.

32:53.240 --> 32:55.117
It's what people wanted to hear.

32:55.520 --> 32:56.555
Even Monique?

32:57.560 --> 32:58.879
Especially Monique.

33:00.320 --> 33:01.799
That's why this was so perfect.

33:02.280 --> 33:03.474
Who would ever know?

33:04.560 --> 33:07.393
Did you know that Roderick was
a homosexual?

33:09.120 --> 33:12.317
I am a French girl.
I know the ways of the world.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.911
But it was never discussed.

33:15.320 --> 33:18.118
But Monique knew. Or suspected it.

33:18.360 --> 33:20.271
She took that photograph, no?

33:20.920 --> 33:23.150
Not that I am aware of. Why?

33:23.440 --> 33:27.752
We believe Monique learned of Roderick's
homosexuality and set out to expose him,

33:28.320 --> 33:32.791
so she rented room 214 under
a false name to spy on room 212.

33:33.480 --> 33:36.631
And then, when the time was right,
she let herself into room 212

33:36.720 --> 33:38.597
and took this photograph.

33:41.960 --> 33:43.552
Do you think he killed her?

33:44.640 --> 33:45.789
What do you think?

33:57.920 --> 34:01.515
- You are a homosexual, yes?
- No, I...

34:01.600 --> 34:05.912
You hire pretty bellmen
who will lie with you

34:06.560 --> 34:08.676
for the price of a bottle of champagne.

34:08.760 --> 34:10.591
<i>- No!
- Please, monsieur.</i>

34:12.199 --> 34:15.158
It is always dangerous
to lie to the police.

34:15.960 --> 34:19.998
But it is stupid
to lie about that

34:20.520 --> 34:22.795
which is not at issue.

34:24.360 --> 34:25.679
Not at issue?

34:26.040 --> 34:27.393
Not at issue?

34:31.560 --> 34:35.917
This is not about making love to men.

34:37.280 --> 34:40.829
This is about murder.

34:41.600 --> 34:43.237
I didn't kill Monique!

34:43.320 --> 34:46.232
Did she not let herself into your room,
Mr Dalewood,

34:46.440 --> 34:47.668
and take these photographs?

34:49.040 --> 34:50.155
Yes.

34:50.320 --> 34:51.435
But then what happened?

34:51.719 --> 34:53.790
- She ran out.
- Where did she go?

34:54.560 --> 34:56.755
- I don't know.
- You didn't follow her?

34:57.520 --> 34:58.953
I tried.

34:59.320 --> 35:00.673
But as soon as I got my clothes on,
she...

35:00.760 --> 35:01.875
Please, Mr Dalewood.

35:02.160 --> 35:03.718
That's quite enough.

35:03.880 --> 35:06.599
I believe you saw her go
into the room next door.

35:07.520 --> 35:09.158
The bellboy told us you sent him away.

35:09.800 --> 35:13.190
Then I believe you let yourself
into room 214 with your master key.

35:13.280 --> 35:14.998
No, that's not what happened!

35:15.080 --> 35:18.516
We found Monique's purse in the laneway
directly below room 214.

35:18.960 --> 35:20.916
Why would she throw her purse
out the window

35:21.000 --> 35:23.514
unless she knew you were coming
after her at that moment?

35:23.720 --> 35:25.153
Do you know what I believe?

35:25.520 --> 35:26.919
I believe Monique is alive.

35:28.120 --> 35:34.434
Then who is the girl who was
stuffed into a trunk in room 214?

35:35.880 --> 35:37.438
I have no idea.

35:40.400 --> 35:44.029
All I know is Monique has set out
to destroy my life.

35:45.600 --> 35:47.192
And she's not finished yet.

35:49.800 --> 35:52.519
It is him. Who else could it be?

35:53.360 --> 35:56.591
Who else has the motivation
and the means?

35:58.000 --> 36:00.434
I agree, but there
are some inconsistencies.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.191
If Monique threw the purse
out the window,

36:03.680 --> 36:05.591
why did Roderick
not retrieve it immediately?

36:06.840 --> 36:09.195
He would have needed
to bind and gag Monique first.

36:09.840 --> 36:10.909
Yes.

36:11.480 --> 36:13.835
But whoever stole the camera
from the purse

36:13.920 --> 36:15.911
did so in a very short period of time.

36:18.840 --> 36:20.353
Perhaps we have a witness.

36:22.120 --> 36:24.076
We need to speak to that pawnbroker.

36:24.560 --> 36:26.915
I've decided not to stand for alderman.

36:27.280 --> 36:29.919
At least not this election.
Maybe next time.

36:30.320 --> 36:31.912
There won't be a next time,
you know that.

36:32.040 --> 36:36.238
Tell me, Thomas, how do you feel
your career has progressed so far?

36:36.680 --> 36:38.238
I suppose I've done all right.

36:38.400 --> 36:40.516
Thomas, a century from now,

36:41.400 --> 36:43.277
when Toronto is a teeming metropolis,

36:43.920 --> 36:47.276
a young woman
will be whisked effortlessly

36:48.320 --> 36:50.754
beneath the crowded street,
and she will give silent thanks

36:50.840 --> 36:52.592
to the man who made that possible.

36:53.200 --> 36:55.714
You. Let that be your legacy.

37:00.920 --> 37:03.992
You reported that a woman sold
this camera to you yesterday.

37:04.080 --> 37:05.195
That's right.

37:05.560 --> 37:08.279
Big brown eyes, pretty, blonde hair.

37:09.120 --> 37:11.111
She lives in a rooming house
down on De Grassi Street.

37:11.720 --> 37:13.119
You know where she lives?

37:13.360 --> 37:15.715
I've watched her go
in there a few times.

37:16.960 --> 37:19.315
She's the kind of girl a man notices.

37:20.280 --> 37:23.590
I was passing through the laneway
and saw the purse on the ground.

37:23.680 --> 37:25.511
I thought it had been thrown out.

37:26.240 --> 37:27.275
I'm not a thief.

37:28.240 --> 37:29.275
Of course not.

37:29.520 --> 37:30.589
Miss Wiggins,

37:32.120 --> 37:33.633
you live on De Grassi Street, yes?

37:34.600 --> 37:37.194
You must do your shopping
at Queen and Broadview.

37:37.720 --> 37:39.358
I do, yes. Why?

37:40.080 --> 37:41.672
<i>Vous êtes trés jolie.</i>

37:43.560 --> 37:44.629
I'm sorry?

37:44.720 --> 37:47.678
Miss Wiggins, let's take a little walk
to my jail cell, shall we?

37:47.920 --> 37:50.388
It was found property. I am not a thief!

37:55.800 --> 37:58.360
Monique! I knew it.

37:58.840 --> 38:01.400
She has changed her hair, but it is her.

38:01.800 --> 38:03.677
I told you she was alive.

38:03.760 --> 38:05.637
I've never seen this man before.

38:05.880 --> 38:06.995
Who's Monique?

38:15.520 --> 38:17.590
She looks so much like Monique.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.511
It's astonishing, the resemblance.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.194
But it is not her.

38:23.440 --> 38:25.032
What are you saying?

38:26.200 --> 38:27.758
Of course, it's her!

38:27.840 --> 38:30.070
I would know my own sister, Roderick.

38:32.320 --> 38:34.550
You are convinced this woman is Monique?

38:34.640 --> 38:36.676
No, I believe
the real Monique was murdered,

38:36.800 --> 38:39.109
and her body was stuffed
in that steamer trunk.

38:39.200 --> 38:42.351
This Victoria Wiggins played
the role of Monique just long enough

38:42.440 --> 38:45.876
for her disappearance and murder
to be pinned on Sophie's husband.

38:46.720 --> 38:50.508
You are saying
Sophie killed her own sister?

38:51.200 --> 38:52.553
Impossible, you're wrong.

38:53.040 --> 38:56.271
I read the letters.
The sisters, they loved each other.

38:57.200 --> 38:58.838
There's something else going on here.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.672
Then whose body was in the trunk?

39:00.960 --> 39:03.872
And why does her hair match
David Bishop's jewellery?

39:05.720 --> 39:08.393
- We do need that photograph of Monique.
- Yes.

39:09.600 --> 39:11.431
Gentlemen, how goes it?

39:11.520 --> 39:12.839
It goes, sir. Almost finished.

39:14.080 --> 39:15.718
Close enough. Let's have a look.

39:25.600 --> 39:26.828
I don't recognise either of them.

39:27.280 --> 39:28.349
I do.

39:28.720 --> 39:31.439
George, take a photograph
of this telefacsimile.

39:31.520 --> 39:33.511
- Sir.
- Inspector.

39:38.480 --> 39:39.754
Here.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.514
This is the woman we know as Sophie.

39:44.360 --> 39:47.750
But I believe this is the real Sophie,
the woman smiling here.

39:48.320 --> 39:51.790
Then who is the woman
who has been calling herself Sophie?

39:56.240 --> 39:57.389
Where did you get this?

39:57.720 --> 40:00.234
It was sent
by Sophie and Monique's father.

40:00.960 --> 40:02.473
- When?
- Yesterday.

40:03.040 --> 40:04.678
It is a telefacsimile.

40:05.120 --> 40:07.759
<i>A new technology invented
by monsieur Murdoch.</i>

40:08.920 --> 40:09.989
Hmm.

40:10.080 --> 40:14.358
This is Monique,
and this is Sophie.

40:14.880 --> 40:17.713
Strangely,
it appears she's not you.

40:18.920 --> 40:21.388
You met Sophie on the ship, didn't you?

40:21.960 --> 40:24.474
Here she is to your right
the day you sailed.

40:24.560 --> 40:27.279
And, during the course of the voyage,
the two of you became friends.

40:27.600 --> 40:30.433
Very good friends.
The kind who tell secrets.

40:31.240 --> 40:34.550
She told you about the arrangement
she had with her wealthy fiancé.

40:35.440 --> 40:37.351
A man whose bed
she would never have to share.

40:37.760 --> 40:39.557
A very good arrangement indeed,

40:40.360 --> 40:42.271
so you decided to take her place.

40:42.640 --> 40:44.915
And once the ship docked in Montreal,
you killed her

40:45.360 --> 40:46.918
and stuffed her body in a steamer trunk.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.433
You can't prove any of that.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.149
<i>Please, madame.</i>

40:50.680 --> 40:53.274
Or should I call you Jaqueline?
Jaqueline Chiasson.

40:53.920 --> 40:56.195
Oh, yes, you remember her, don't you?

40:56.600 --> 40:59.751
She is wanted by the French police
for murder in Normandy 10 months ago.

41:00.600 --> 41:03.717
The French consulate here is
sending us her photo as we speak.

41:03.960 --> 41:06.713
And I wonder what she will look like.

41:08.360 --> 41:11.318
If you're willing to make a confession,
we can help you avoid the noose.

41:11.520 --> 41:14.717
But perhaps she would prefer
the guillotine. Oh, it's up to you.

41:19.880 --> 41:21.199
It seemed so perfect.

41:22.400 --> 41:23.594
A new identity,

41:24.480 --> 41:25.549
new life.

41:26.720 --> 41:28.517
But then her sister had to come
and ruin it all.

41:28.960 --> 41:31.599
Oh, but that's when you turned a problem
into an opportunity.

41:32.920 --> 41:35.514
Kill Monique, and frame
your husband for her murder.

41:36.760 --> 41:39.479
And then you would have
all of his wealth once he was hanged.

41:40.240 --> 41:42.470
That was a most devious plan.

41:42.920 --> 41:46.037
You knew your husband dallied
with the bellman in room 212,

41:46.640 --> 41:48.392
and he would do anything
to protect his secret.

41:48.480 --> 41:51.517
So you made it appear
as if Monique was caught spying on him

41:51.600 --> 41:53.591
and was killed for it.

41:55.320 --> 41:56.594
Fantastic.

41:57.280 --> 41:59.840
That's when your accomplice
Victoria Wiggins, came in.

41:59.920 --> 42:02.115
You needed someone to play
the role of Monique.

42:03.000 --> 42:09.269
When the real Monique was bound
and gagged in room 214 for three days.

42:09.640 --> 42:12.712
I felt bad for her, but what can I say?

42:13.280 --> 42:14.599
It wasn't my sister.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.479
What a remarkable notion, William.

42:29.840 --> 42:31.114
You've outdone yourself.

42:31.240 --> 42:33.151
You know, sir, I foresee a day

42:33.240 --> 42:36.232
when telefacsimiles will be created
automatically by machine.

42:36.680 --> 42:39.672
Huge simile machines
that would take just minutes.

42:42.440 --> 42:46.433
Dr Ogden, if there is one image
I will take home to France,

42:46.520 --> 42:48.875
it is of you looking at me.

42:52.680 --> 42:55.831
Jaqueline Chiasson, also known as
Sophie Dalewood.

42:56.480 --> 42:57.993
Such a tragedy for the father.

42:58.080 --> 43:00.389
Yes, to fear for a missing child

43:00.480 --> 43:02.516
only to discover both daughters killed
by this woman.

43:03.200 --> 43:04.269
Mmm.

43:04.600 --> 43:06.238
Thank you, Inspector Guillaume.

43:06.880 --> 43:08.029
The pleasure was mine.

43:08.560 --> 43:11.438
Now I can attest at the next conference

43:11.520 --> 43:15.559
international police cooperation is
not only possible, it's already a fact.

43:24.040 --> 43:29.672
William, just a little joie de vivre,
that's a good thing.

43:30.280 --> 43:31.315
I'll try.

43:31.760 --> 43:32.875
Please do.

43:33.680 --> 43:35.352
<i>Mademoiselle. Monsieur.</i>

43:35.720 --> 43:37.199
<i>Merci, Señor Guillaume.</i>

43:39.320 --> 43:41.709
Whatever was that about, William?

43:41.840 --> 43:45.037
He believes
I should try to be more French.

43:46.560 --> 43:47.913
Well, shouldn't we all?

43:51.080 --> 43:52.149
Gentlemen.

43:57.920 --> 43:58.989
Sir.

43:59.600 --> 44:02.478
Have you made a decision
regarding your run for alderman?

44:02.560 --> 44:04.869
I've just come from a meeting
with the backers.

44:05.240 --> 44:07.834
I've thought about this subway issue
six ways from Sunday.

44:07.920 --> 44:08.955
And?

44:09.040 --> 44:11.918
Well, it's not just
the one subway line, Murdoch.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.672
They're talking about
one up Yonge Street as well,

44:13.760 --> 44:15.239
maybe even one across Bloor.

44:15.320 --> 44:18.039
Hmm. That's an ambitious undertaking.

44:18.200 --> 44:19.394
Yes, I know.

44:20.080 --> 44:23.356
And if it goes wrong, there'll be a mob
howling at my door.

44:23.640 --> 44:26.359
But any city without a subway
will get left behind.

44:27.720 --> 44:28.948
So I'm going to do it.

44:30.160 --> 44:31.559
I'm going to run for alderman.

44:32.800 --> 44:35.519
In that case, let me be
the first to congratulate you, sir.

44:36.040 --> 44:38.474
My best wishes
for a very successful campaign.

44:38.720 --> 44:40.153
Thank you, Murdoch.

44:41.400 --> 44:43.675
I'm in it now, aren't I?

44:45.200 --> 44:46.997
Yes, sir, it would appear you are.
