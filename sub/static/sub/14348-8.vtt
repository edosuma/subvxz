WEBVTT

00:03.536 --> 00:06.039
I wanna ride the blue horse,
Daddy. I wanna ride the blue horse.

00:06.074 --> 00:08.006
There's plenty of blue
horses for everybody. Right!

00:08.041 --> 00:11.044
I'm want to ride the blue horse.
Stop arguing about the horses.

00:11.079 --> 00:14.547
Stop it!
Connor, stop!

00:19.552 --> 00:22.055
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:23.056 --> 00:25.558
My kids are here. I really
don't want to get into it--

00:25.593 --> 00:27.560
Hey, relax. I'm not
gonna cause a scene.

00:27.595 --> 00:29.527
This is my ex, Tommy.

00:29.562 --> 00:31.398
The one that I told you
about. Hi. How are you?

00:31.433 --> 00:33.400
This is my new friend,
Debbie.

00:33.666 --> 00:36.903
What's up, Debbie?
Talk to you for a sec?

00:37.170 --> 00:39.139
I'll be right back.

00:41.141 --> 00:44.109
So this is
greener pastures, huh?

00:44.144 --> 00:47.647
Oh, yeah, by a long shot. You know, I
should probably be thanking you, but I won't.

00:48.148 --> 00:50.115
Okay.
Ow. Ow.

00:50.150 --> 00:53.118
Are you kidding me?
What? All right, what?

00:53.153 --> 00:55.887
I can't be a lesbian because
you're so goddamn good in the sack?

00:55.922 --> 00:59.659
No, no. You can't be a lesbian because
we both know you love cock, okay?

00:59.694 --> 01:02.627
Okay, well, I might have
loved cock last week-- Shh.

01:02.662 --> 01:05.331
But this is the new me. This
is who I am now. Oh, really?

01:05.366 --> 01:07.851
Really? You just turned into
a muff diver overnight, huh?

01:07.886 --> 01:10.336
What'd you take, a muff-diving
pill? You're so disgusting.

01:10.371 --> 01:12.338
Yeah.
What, you don't believe me?

01:12.373 --> 01:14.841
Uh, no.

01:18.611 --> 01:21.347
Big deal.

01:23.716 --> 01:25.685
I've seen it a million times
onGirls Gone Wild.

01:25.720 --> 01:28.021
Yeah? What about this?

01:30.523 --> 01:33.825
Daddy, why is Auntie Sheila
touching that woman's--

01:33.860 --> 01:37.864
Come on. Come on. Kids! Connor,
Colleen, let's go. Hurry up!

01:41.701 --> 01:45.472
I thought you were working
a double shift today.

01:45.507 --> 01:47.439
I got somebody
to cover for me.

01:47.474 --> 01:50.977
What, you got a bunch of dish rags
there? No, I got some stuff I found.

01:51.478 --> 01:53.980
Oh! Where'd you get that,
outside of a homeless shelter?

01:54.015 --> 01:55.947
Yeah, like I'd do that.

01:55.982 --> 01:58.985
Oh, come on, Tommy,
you got to be kidding me.

01:59.285 --> 02:03.323
Look, it's not like I have an attic or a
cellar or anything that I can store stuff in.

02:03.358 --> 02:05.825
I got no place since your girlfriend
from the F.B.I. showed up...

02:05.860 --> 02:08.011
and kicked me out of his joint,
unannounced, I might add.

02:08.045 --> 02:10.163
Rock bottom. It just doesn't
exist for you, does it?

02:10.198 --> 02:12.130
I'm trying to repay
my debt to society.

02:12.165 --> 02:16.736
It's gonna take a lot more than digging up some
Dumpster diver's dirty undies to repay that debt.

02:16.771 --> 02:19.906
I thought you were taking the kids
to the game? The tickets fell through.

02:20.306 --> 02:23.576
Oh, really? Yeah, the goddamn
scalper. He broke those kids' hearts.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.411
Yeah, what an asshole.
Yeah, major asshole.

02:25.446 --> 02:27.712
Hey, Father.

02:27.747 --> 02:30.715
Hey, what a wonderful surprise. Father.

02:30.750 --> 02:35.220
Hey, Ricky, boys,
can we take these bags here?

02:35.255 --> 02:38.508
I didn't think we'd, uh,
see either one of you today.

02:38.543 --> 02:41.761
Well, you know, comes to
charity, we clear the deck.

02:41.796 --> 02:45.063
Yeah. So, uh, hey,
is, uh, Mariel around?

02:45.098 --> 02:48.935
Oh, no. She's cracking the whip at another
location. Probably gonna be gone all day.

02:48.970 --> 02:51.236
Oh. Oh. But that's why
I'm so glad to see you.

02:51.271 --> 02:53.738
Roll up your sleeves. We got
a lot for everyone to do here.

02:53.773 --> 02:56.442
The thing is, I'm still working actually.
I just came over from the firehouse.

02:56.943 --> 02:59.279
I wanted to personally make sure that you
got those clothes, and I gotta get back.

02:59.779 --> 03:02.247
But Johnny's free all day.
It's his day off.

03:02.282 --> 03:05.034
And nothing he likes better than
digging in and helping a charity, right?

03:05.069 --> 03:07.787
So you two have fun, uh, folding the
clothes, and I'll talk to you soon.

03:08.288 --> 03:10.123
Thanks again. It's
all right. No problem.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:23.736 --> 03:26.437
What's going on?
Nothing.

03:26.472 --> 03:29.976
Look, I know you well enough. You go in
these meetings, you're all ears usually.

03:30.443 --> 03:33.479
That girl was up there whining at the
podium, you were like a million miles away.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.749
What's going on?
Father Murphy.

03:35.784 --> 03:37.949
Oh, not this again.
Come on.

03:37.984 --> 03:41.988
Tom, I looked into the guy. He's been bounced
around in three or four different churches.

03:42.023 --> 03:43.788
Doesn't exactly bode well
for a young guy.

03:43.823 --> 03:45.658
Just because a priest moves
parishes a couple of times...

03:46.159 --> 03:47.660
doesn't mean he's automatically
a child molester.

03:48.161 --> 03:51.497
That's some leap of faith you got going
on there. I call 'em like I see them.

03:51.864 --> 03:53.298
Yeah.
It's all a conspiracy.

03:53.333 --> 03:57.270
In the olden days, the priests used to
lock away young boys to have sex with.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.272
Called them catamites.
Thank you.

03:59.307 --> 04:01.139
Catamites!
All right.

04:01.174 --> 04:04.677
You know, I saw a band down at
CBGB's years ago called the Catamites.

04:04.712 --> 04:07.197
A bunch of guys from
London, I think. Oh, yeah?

04:07.232 --> 04:09.682
Bass player try to
give you a blow job? No.

04:09.717 --> 04:12.185
Different catamites.

04:14.687 --> 04:17.356
I'm gonna stretch
my legs, Tom.

04:17.391 --> 04:20.026
You want a soda?
Love a soda.

04:25.531 --> 04:27.967
Mmm.

04:43.549 --> 04:45.218
What's up?

04:45.618 --> 04:48.587
- Just waiting on your boyfriend.
- Me too.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.557
You know, he led me
to believe-- I know.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.524
He's full of goddamn promises.

04:53.559 --> 04:57.063
I've been waiting for a ring since
three weeks before the Last Supper.

04:57.563 --> 04:59.565
Really?

05:04.070 --> 05:08.574
I want you to listen to me,
and I want you to listen hard.

05:08.609 --> 05:11.094
Down on your knees.
Huh?

05:11.129 --> 05:13.579
Come on big boy, down.

05:15.081 --> 05:17.083
That's it.

05:20.620 --> 05:24.090
What are the things
you want most in this world?

05:25.591 --> 05:28.094
Come on, Tommy, we don't
have a lot of time here.

05:28.129 --> 05:30.061
What do you want
the most?

05:30.096 --> 05:33.099
Well, I want this kid
to live obviously.

05:33.134 --> 05:35.566
What else?

05:35.601 --> 05:38.569
I guess if I--
if I could get my marriage...

05:38.604 --> 05:41.572
to go back to the way it
used to be, I would do that.

05:41.607 --> 05:45.910
I mean, I know it's probably
impossible-- Pray. Right now.

05:45.945 --> 05:50.283
Make the sign of the cross, bow your
head and pray to God, our Father.

05:50.318 --> 05:53.953
Forget Jesus. Cut the middle
man out, go right to the source.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.790
Do it.
Okay.

06:24.851 --> 06:27.552
On another day
C'mon, c'mon

06:27.587 --> 06:30.857
With these ropes I tied
can we do no wrong

06:31.357 --> 06:33.693
Now we grieve
'cause now is gone

06:34.160 --> 06:36.961
Things were good
when we were young

06:36.996 --> 06:40.332
With my teeth locked down
I can see the blood

06:40.367 --> 06:43.669
Of a thousand men
who have come and gone

06:43.704 --> 06:47.138
Now we grieve
'cause now is gone

06:47.173 --> 06:50.343
Things were good
when we were young

06:50.378 --> 06:53.478
Is it safe to say
C'mon, c'mon

06:53.513 --> 06:56.682
Was it right to leave
C'mon, c'mon

06:56.717 --> 07:00.036
Will I ever learn
C'mon, c'mon

07:00.071 --> 07:03.356
C'mon, c'mon,
c'mon, c'mon

07:08.161 --> 07:10.363
It's a fantastic idea.

07:10.596 --> 07:12.731
If there's anything this
old girl needs, it's a party.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.867
Ah, I'm not so sure.
You know, Pete, your father--

07:15.101 --> 07:19.539
Forget him. He doesn't
live in this house alone.

07:19.772 --> 07:23.643
Let me take a wild guess as to who the
topic of conversation was up to this point.

07:23.910 --> 07:27.380
It was Steven. We're gonna have
the most wonderful party for him.

07:27.415 --> 07:29.048
- Is that right?
- Jeannie, I--

07:29.549 --> 07:31.884
Oh, don't be
a stick in the mud.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.387
It'll be fun, Jerry.

07:34.422 --> 07:36.621
Come on, Pop.

07:36.656 --> 07:38.356
A few friends,
a few beers.

07:38.391 --> 07:41.692
Get some nice thick steaks,
we'll christen the new grill.

07:41.727 --> 07:44.564
You know, every Fourth of July, your
father used to put on a funny hat...

07:44.599 --> 07:47.031
and grill sirloins
for half the neighborhood.

07:47.066 --> 07:50.903
- They used to line up all the way down the block.
- You remember that?

07:52.338 --> 07:55.091
Well, of course,
I do, honey.

07:55.126 --> 07:57.844
Think you still got the hat?

07:59.579 --> 08:02.915
Yeah, I-I can
probably dig it up.

08:03.282 --> 08:05.251
We have slim pickings, bro.

08:05.751 --> 08:07.718
Yeah, real slim.

08:07.753 --> 08:11.757
No. I'm talking about
the meetings. Jesus. Oh.

08:11.792 --> 08:13.724
Well, we haven't
done smokers.

08:13.759 --> 08:16.227
Oh, yeah. How many hotties
are gonna go to that meeting?

08:16.262 --> 08:20.015
I really wanna bang a chick in an
iron lung. Well, what about gamblers?

08:20.050 --> 08:23.769
Yeah, well, you know, if you're into,
like, middle-aged, fat, bald guys.

08:23.804 --> 08:26.289
Come on, drugs,
booze, sex, food.

08:26.324 --> 08:28.739
That's where the talent's at. Right.

08:28.774 --> 08:30.776
Hey, you don't think I came
off like a bitch, do you?

08:30.811 --> 08:33.279
Mmm, maybe a little.
But you're my bitch now.

08:33.513 --> 08:38.049
I'm kidding. You were great. You were
really great. I'm so proud of you.

08:38.085 --> 08:40.385
Hey, hey, hey.

08:40.653 --> 08:42.621
Hey, look at this, ooh.
Did you invite them?

08:42.855 --> 08:44.891
No.

08:45.391 --> 08:49.395
Okay, let's, um-- let's
just play it cool. Okay.

08:51.797 --> 08:54.031
Hey!
Hey!

08:54.066 --> 08:57.268
Franco!
How are you, man?

08:57.303 --> 09:00.139
- Good to see you, man.
- Thank you guys for coming down. I appreciate it.

09:00.640 --> 09:03.976
Oh, well, Frank, I just wanted to say that
we're really happy you're getting better.

09:04.011 --> 09:07.413
And you don't have to worry about
me. Not a word. I had no idea.

09:07.448 --> 09:10.816
What are you talking about? I'm
here for support like you dinks.

09:10.851 --> 09:13.152
Oh, well, hey, anything to
support a brother, right?

09:13.187 --> 09:16.989
- Right.
- Bulimia. Last call for Bulimia.

09:19.325 --> 09:21.327
W-We'll see you in the
morning. Get home safe.

09:21.362 --> 09:23.294
Take care.
Right.

09:23.329 --> 09:25.331
Hey, how you doing?
Hi.

09:25.366 --> 09:27.667
Hi.

09:30.836 --> 09:32.803
Hi.
Hey.

09:32.838 --> 09:35.306
Come on in.
Thanks.

09:35.341 --> 09:39.345
It was so thoughtful of you to contribute
yesterday. Oh, it's nothing. Nothing.

09:39.380 --> 09:43.349
So make yourself comfortable.
I'm gonna go put on my face. Okay.

09:43.384 --> 09:46.852
I think the face you have on
right now looks pretty good.

09:46.887 --> 09:50.356
You're very sweet. Five minutes. Okay.

09:51.857 --> 09:54.325
Half sister.
Half sister.

09:54.360 --> 09:58.864
- Tommy, would you grab that for me?
- Uh, sure. Yeah, yeah.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.831
Hello.

10:00.866 --> 10:04.335
Tommy?
Johnny?

10:04.370 --> 10:07.122
I dialed the wrong number?
No.

10:07.157 --> 10:09.840
Mariel invited me
out, okay?

10:09.875 --> 10:11.842
I don't believe this, man.
You're sick, you know that?

10:11.877 --> 10:15.147
Hey, this is a-a thing about the
contributions. It's a charity thing.

10:15.414 --> 10:19.385
Do not do this, all right? You knock
her up, the kid's gonna be retarded.

10:19.420 --> 10:21.220
This family's full of
retards. He'll fit right in.

10:21.255 --> 10:23.055
They got a word for this.
It's called incest.

10:23.556 --> 10:26.559
You ever heard of it? Incest. What
are you calling about, asshole, huh?

10:26.594 --> 10:28.394
Because I came across
some more stuff to donate.

10:28.761 --> 10:30.730
Sure you did.
Bye-bye.

10:30.765 --> 10:32.697
Jerk.

10:32.732 --> 10:38.738
- Who was it?
- Uh, oh, it was, uh, some telemarketing... guy.

10:42.241 --> 10:45.494
What are you smiling at?

10:45.529 --> 10:48.713
It's nice that--
What?

10:48.748 --> 10:52.216
Sharing. You kind of
tend to hoard your food.

10:52.251 --> 10:54.719
I was starting to wonder
if maybe you did some time.

10:54.754 --> 10:58.758
Yeah, I guess maybe I have in
some ways. But I'm a free man now.

10:58.793 --> 11:01.225
Yeah?
Yeah.

11:01.260 --> 11:03.262
You know, on the subject
of sharing, Laura.

11:03.763 --> 11:06.766
I've been thinking.
You and me-- Yeah?

11:06.801 --> 11:09.734
What do you think about
shacking up?

11:09.769 --> 11:12.236
I'm not talking about getting
married or anything, but...

11:12.271 --> 11:17.610
I don't know, you're over almost every night
as it is, and I really care about you, Laura.

11:17.645 --> 11:20.077
I mean, Keela's crazy
about you.

11:20.112 --> 11:24.116
I think we should be together.
So there. What do you say?

11:25.551 --> 11:29.055
That's a really big step.
Yeah, it's a first for me.

11:29.555 --> 11:32.523
And it could really
complicate things at work.

11:32.558 --> 11:36.027
I don't give a shit about that.
I'm not ashamed of what we've got.

11:36.062 --> 11:39.565
I mean, believe me, Laura, I never
thought I'd hear myself say these words,

11:39.600 --> 11:44.087
but I'm ready to take the next
step, the shacking up step.

11:44.122 --> 11:48.574
Before we did, we'd have to
put everything out on the table.

11:49.075 --> 11:51.542
I agree.

11:51.577 --> 11:55.081
And please don't take this
as an accusation, but I just--

11:55.116 --> 11:57.548
I need to know if you've
been seeing anybody else.

11:57.583 --> 12:01.587
I mean, call it insecurity on just my
part. I-I just need to know for myself.

12:02.088 --> 12:06.092
There's just you, Laura.
I don't want anybody else.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.134
I'm so glad you appreciate
this kind of thing.

12:17.169 --> 12:21.173
Hey, whenever you want to watch a
raving lunatic chop his family to pieces,

12:21.208 --> 12:23.641
you know who to call.
Oh, that's good to know.

12:23.676 --> 12:26.679
Hey, listen, uh, there's this great
coffee shop right around the corner,

12:27.179 --> 12:30.182
if you want to pop in there.
We should call it a night.

12:30.217 --> 12:32.685
Your secret admirer's here.

12:36.188 --> 12:41.158
Um, another time?
We'll see.

12:41.193 --> 12:46.198
Listen, about the, uh-- about the cash,
um, can I just settle up next time?

12:46.233 --> 12:50.703
Tell you what? You got the
movie, let's call it even.

12:50.738 --> 12:53.706
Okay.
Okay. I'll see you later.

13:01.714 --> 13:05.217
It's a great place.
Yeah, I come here a lot.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.184
They have a fantastic
wine list.

13:07.219 --> 13:09.722
Yeah, you know, I was never
really much of a wine guy.

13:09.757 --> 13:12.189
No?
No.

13:12.224 --> 13:16.729
You a whiskey guy? Whiskey,
yes, and vodka, you know.

13:17.229 --> 13:22.700
And scotch and bourbon,
rum, gin--

13:22.735 --> 13:25.738
And, uh, let's not forget
the entire schnapps family.

13:25.773 --> 13:27.705
You're funny, Tommy.

13:27.740 --> 13:30.743
And you're gorgeous.
So are you.

13:30.778 --> 13:33.210
Come on.
I'm serious.

13:33.245 --> 13:35.748
It's been keeping me up nights
ever since we met.

13:35.783 --> 13:40.217
Yeah, but I mean,
let's be honest.

13:40.252 --> 13:44.523
There is kind of an "ick"
factor to this, isn't there?

13:44.558 --> 13:47.259
I have a confession to make.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.763
I'm not 100% sure
you and I have the same father.

13:50.798 --> 13:52.765
But you're Murph's sister.

13:53.265 --> 13:55.733
Yeah.
We have the same mother.

13:55.768 --> 13:59.271
But she was, um--
How do I put this gently?

13:59.306 --> 14:01.774
Um, a bit of a whore.

14:01.809 --> 14:03.741
Aren't we all?

14:03.776 --> 14:06.779
Your dad was the only one who
ever stepped up to support us.

14:06.814 --> 14:09.215
So, now, Murph's
not my brother or--

14:09.250 --> 14:11.582
No, no, he is.
We're certain of that.

14:11.617 --> 14:16.121
But your dad had broken things off for a
while around the time when I was conceived.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.589
And we didn't tell Liam...

14:18.624 --> 14:23.093
because he was so sensitive
about Mom's liberal mating habits.

14:23.128 --> 14:27.132
But in order to protect Liam, we
had to keep it from your dad too.

14:27.167 --> 14:30.636
Hmm.
Interesting.

14:34.807 --> 14:36.809
Oh. Mmm.

14:37.309 --> 14:39.777
No. Mmm.

14:39.812 --> 14:43.280
Okay. You know, I-I
can't-- I can't do this.

14:43.315 --> 14:48.285
- Uh! I mean, maybe I can, but--
- You can, if you want to.

14:48.320 --> 14:52.324
Okay, wants not the problem. Okay, I've got
plenty of want. I got want up the ying-yang.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.326
You still thinking about
the sister thing?

14:54.827 --> 14:58.330
I just-- Maybe I just need to
find out for certain, you know?

14:58.365 --> 15:00.833
- Maybe like a blood test.
- You think so?

15:00.868 --> 15:02.835
Uh, it's worth a shot.

15:03.335 --> 15:05.838
It's worth a whole hell
of a lot more than that.

15:05.873 --> 15:09.942
Oh, God.
I gotta go. Thanks.

15:16.949 --> 15:19.451
All right, boys and girls,
listen up. Hey, hey, hey.

15:19.486 --> 15:21.954
The wife is having a party
tomorrow after the tour,

15:22.454 --> 15:24.456
and I thought you guys might
want to join in and, uh--

15:24.957 --> 15:28.425
Hey, high five.

15:28.460 --> 15:31.463
- What's the occasion?
- Steve's birthday.

15:31.730 --> 15:33.799
Gay Steve?

15:37.036 --> 15:39.805
What?

15:40.306 --> 15:44.710
- I, uh-- I can't make it because
I've got an A.A.-- - Meeting?

15:45.077 --> 15:47.880
Actually, a festival. It's like a
two or three day series of meetings.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.781
- Lou?
- You know what, Chief, it's the back.

15:50.816 --> 15:54.219
It's-- It's bad today. A lot
of pain, a lot of stiffness.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.055
Let me-- Let me help you rub
that out there, Lou.

15:56.090 --> 15:58.390
What happens is it
fuses the vertebrae.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.392
Oh, that's good, Franco.
Yeah?

16:00.893 --> 16:02.895
I really didn't know what--
Garrity?

16:03.395 --> 16:05.230
No. I-- there's a--
I got a-- Um, it's a--

16:05.265 --> 16:07.364
Let me come back to you.
Probie?

16:07.399 --> 16:13.005
I don't-- I really-- Gay
people kind of scare me, Chief.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.007
Finally, an honest answer.

16:15.274 --> 16:18.744
What do you got, Franco? I'm, uh--
I'm helping Lou with his-his back.

16:18.779 --> 16:21.246
Ow! Jesus.
Sorry.

16:22.247 --> 16:25.250
- Laura?
- Would you like me to bring the cake, Chief?

16:25.285 --> 16:28.552
Yeah. That would be great.
Thanks. Numbnuts?

16:28.587 --> 16:32.091
I can't. I got a, uh-- There's
a doctor's, uh, appointment.

16:32.458 --> 16:36.894
- For what?
- Uh, the ass doctor?

16:36.929 --> 16:40.933
It took you 30 seconds to come up with
ass doctor? For that alone, you're coming.

16:41.166 --> 16:44.536
In fact, you're all coming.
I'm not asking. I'm telling you.

16:48.540 --> 16:51.276
I know it's out of the way, but anytime
you guys want to go across town...

16:51.777 --> 16:54.279
for one of these grinders, I'm
in. Grinders? What the hell?

16:54.314 --> 16:56.782
It's a gyro, you dipshit. Where
are these terms coming from?

16:57.282 --> 17:00.786
I'll tell you what a hero is. A hero is Ted
Williams, John F. Kennedy, those are heroes.

17:00.821 --> 17:04.455
This is meat in bread. This is a
goddamn sandwich, is what it is.

17:04.491 --> 17:07.291
We got a car in a river
about two blocks from here.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.093
Aren't we out of
our district already.

17:09.127 --> 17:11.130
It's all right. We'll save the
guy, we'll give him a grinder.

17:11.497 --> 17:13.262
Marine P.D. unit's
about five minutes away.

17:13.298 --> 17:15.634
Looks like we're gonna be first
due, boys. Time to get wet.

17:15.669 --> 17:18.137
So much for waiting
a half hour after you eat, huh?

17:30.482 --> 17:33.152
Come on, boys. We got a body.
I can see it right there.

17:33.187 --> 17:35.988
I'm ready to go.
You guys ready?

17:40.993 --> 17:43.127
Hey, Probie!

17:43.162 --> 17:45.764
We got a confirmed 1045.
We need E.M.S.

17:45.799 --> 17:48.632
That's it, boss.
That's it.

17:48.667 --> 17:51.170
Come on, Probie, tie it
off. That's it, get her out.

17:51.537 --> 17:53.338
Look who's here. Just
in time. Nice, Franco.

18:01.513 --> 18:03.015
Need help?
I'm okay.

18:05.017 --> 18:07.918
What the hell are you guys doing
here? Marine units on its way.

18:07.953 --> 18:11.023
Maybe we should've pulled out a couple lawn
chairs and waited for you guys to show up, huh?

18:13.859 --> 18:18.530
Who says we can't work
together, come on.

18:20.866 --> 18:24.168
What were you fishing? Just
in time to steal a headline.

18:24.203 --> 18:27.004
- Can you believe this?
- Looks like this grab's ours, boys.

18:27.039 --> 18:30.042
Maybe you guys can go back to whatever bar
you crawled out of. You want to know something?

18:30.077 --> 18:32.544
If you spent less time at
Dunkin' Donuts pulling your puds,

18:32.579 --> 18:34.511
we wouldn't have to be
here saving your asses.

18:34.546 --> 18:37.382
I'm glad you guys are running point for
the city in the next terrorist attack.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.218
Maybe you'll be late
to that too, huh?

18:39.718 --> 18:43.187
Hey, maybe, it'll get
done right this time.

18:43.222 --> 18:46.975
Stand down, firemen! Stand
down! Forget about it.

18:47.010 --> 18:50.694
Ah, Jesus Christ, my skin
smells like it's rotting.

18:50.729 --> 18:54.233
Yeah, you know what? Should bottle
that and call it Essence of Ass.

18:54.268 --> 18:56.235
Hey, is, uh, Franco all right?
Yeah, he tweaked his shoulder.

18:56.735 --> 18:59.071
Laura's picking him up at the hospital.
They're gonna meet us at the party.

18:59.304 --> 19:03.707
Hey, guys, look at this. A little souvenir
from our battle with the bulls, huh?

19:03.742 --> 19:07.746
I think I'll stick that on the front of the
rig. It'll be a new hood ornament, right?

19:07.781 --> 19:09.713
We should stick that asshole's
head on a pike outside of the house.

19:09.748 --> 19:13.585
Enough of this kind of stuff. I don't need
you guys taking this attitude to the party.

19:13.620 --> 19:17.422
Yeah, you're right. He's right. We
should be, you know, more festive.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.358
Did you say "festive"?

19:19.791 --> 19:22.027
What? I did--
I didn't use it correctly?

19:22.062 --> 19:25.414
Go get washed up.
You stink.

19:25.449 --> 19:28.767
I know I stink.
Festive.

19:41.613 --> 19:43.782
Holy shit!
Yeah.

19:46.118 --> 19:49.955
We should've brought the engine. This place
can go up in flames at any given moment.

19:55.127 --> 19:58.297
It looks like the Gay Pride Parade took
a detour through Jerry's living room.

19:58.332 --> 20:01.133
Yeah. He's a much braver man
than even I thought.

20:01.168 --> 20:03.267
Hey, hey, hey.

20:03.302 --> 20:04.970
Wait, you got to
take a piss?

20:05.337 --> 20:09.808
What? Oh, no, the, uh,
music was just really good.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.477
- Probie, get in there and get us some booze, will you?
- Why me?

20:12.512 --> 20:14.313
You could probably slip under
the gaydar the way you look.

20:14.348 --> 20:16.613
- Me? What about Sean?
- All right, look.

20:16.648 --> 20:20.152
If we're gonna have the gayest looking guy in
the crew contest right now, you win hands down.

20:20.187 --> 20:22.321
- Or pants down, as the case may be.
- What does that mean?

20:22.821 --> 20:24.823
He's got, like, better hair than
I do? Something? Better body?

20:25.224 --> 20:27.593
What? You're not really asking me
that question right now, are you?

20:27.628 --> 20:29.828
Hey, what are you guys
standing out here for?

20:30.062 --> 20:33.365
Hey, Franco, help us out, man.
Who looks gayer, me or the probie?

20:33.400 --> 20:36.668
You've got to be kidding me? We're
having a who-looks-gayer contest?

20:36.703 --> 20:38.604
- Yep.
- Where's the chief?

20:38.870 --> 20:41.305
He's inside with half the
population of San Francisco.

20:41.340 --> 20:44.009
- Come on, help us out, Franco. - I gotta
go with Sean-O. He's got a better body.

20:44.376 --> 20:46.845
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Oh, congratulations, twinkle toes.

20:47.346 --> 20:49.348
- Probie, booze, now!
-Yeah, but you just--

20:49.748 --> 20:52.851
Now!
This sucks.

20:54.186 --> 20:56.688
Hi, sweetie. What the
hell is going on here?

20:56.723 --> 20:59.656
Only the most
fabulous party ever.

20:59.691 --> 21:01.658
You told me this was gonna
be a small get-together.

21:01.693 --> 21:04.963
A few friends, a couple of beers
and some steaks on the grill.

21:04.998 --> 21:07.831
It's turned into
a full-blown fag-fest.

21:07.866 --> 21:09.868
Dad, believe it or not,
this is a small get-together.

21:10.369 --> 21:13.622
The last party we had, we were
turning them away at the door.

21:13.657 --> 21:16.875
Oh, don't be a grump, Jerry.
Steven's friends are wonderful.

21:17.376 --> 21:19.961
Hey, Jesus,
what took you so long?

21:19.996 --> 21:22.512
Not really a beer crowd
in there.

21:22.547 --> 21:25.651
I scrounged up some cosmos, appletinis and
a couple of wine coolers. Best I could do.

21:25.917 --> 21:28.153
God, even I feel gay
drinking this.

21:28.420 --> 21:30.354
It's actually a cool party.
The music's jamming.

21:30.389 --> 21:32.724
There's even some chicks in
there. Chicks named Kevin and Bill.

21:32.759 --> 21:37.396
No. The real thing. Hair,
breasts, the whole package.

21:37.629 --> 21:40.197
I-I'm going back in.

21:40.232 --> 21:43.235
Where you going? Um, you know,
he said there's chicks in there.

21:43.270 --> 21:46.238
Yeah, but you gotta fight through
10 yards of gay to get to them.

21:48.740 --> 21:51.076
And then there were four.

21:51.576 --> 21:54.079
Unbelievable.

21:57.783 --> 22:00.585
I'm gonna go in there and check it out for
a minute, you know? I don't want to be rude.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.421
Nah.

22:06.858 --> 22:09.695
And then there were two.

22:09.961 --> 22:13.432
Works over.
Playtime begins.

22:13.799 --> 22:15.767
Hey, uh, look, I'm
a little tied up right now.

22:16.268 --> 22:18.770
That's exactly what I had
in mind. Where are you?

22:18.805 --> 22:21.004
I'm, uh, I'm at a thing.
I can't get away.

22:21.039 --> 22:23.875
- Are you at a party?
- No. No. It's a work thing.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.742
Is Linda there?
Who? Linda?

22:25.777 --> 22:29.281
No, no, she couldn't-- Uh, no,
no. You're lying. I'm coming over.

22:29.316 --> 22:31.116
Sondra, I really don't
think that's a good idea.

22:31.616 --> 22:34.119
It's the perfect opportunity to meet her.
I'll say I'm friends with one of the guys.

22:34.486 --> 22:38.290
-I don't think it's a good idea.
-I'm gonna have to start rethinking this relationship.

22:41.960 --> 22:45.262
Hey, nice dance moves.
Didn't know you had it in you.

22:45.297 --> 22:49.266
Oh, thanks. This party's
off the hook, you know?

22:49.301 --> 22:53.472
Ooh. It's too bad there aren't any women
here though. I mean, more women, you know?

22:53.507 --> 22:56.808
I'm surprised Franco stuck around as
long as he did, pussy hound that he is.

22:56.843 --> 23:00.312
I think he's gotten a little
bit better in that arena lately.

23:00.347 --> 23:02.879
What are you kidding?
Franco? Come on.

23:02.914 --> 23:05.115
Guy will be chasing tail
till the day he dies.

23:05.150 --> 23:08.987
You know, like, take that nurse
that he was banging, for example.

23:09.022 --> 23:12.007
What nurse? Just the,
uh, you know, the, uh--

23:12.042 --> 23:14.993
the nurse that he was banging
to get the Vicodin.

23:18.163 --> 23:22.966
Why are you telling me this? I-I
just-- It was, uh-- It slipped out.

23:23.001 --> 23:27.339
It's just, you know, part of making amends
in the 12-step program. Franco knows that.

23:27.839 --> 23:31.343
You're supposed to make amends for
yourself, asshole, not other people.

23:36.848 --> 23:39.851
Boy, look at the probie.
What a fag.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.287
Tell me about it.

23:46.792 --> 23:49.027
Hey.
Go to hell.

23:51.363 --> 23:55.200
Hey, Laura. Wait a
minute. Get away from me.

23:55.700 --> 23:59.204
Laura, what happened in there?
Oh, like you give a shit?

23:59.239 --> 24:02.707
Screw you, Franco.
Laura, come on, don't--

24:06.211 --> 24:08.380
What the hell
was that about?

24:12.717 --> 24:16.988
Hi, Dad.
Holy mother of--

24:17.023 --> 24:20.190
Katy? Connor?

24:20.225 --> 24:23.395
Hey, guys,
how are my babies? Hello.

24:23.430 --> 24:27.399
Hello.
Colleen?

24:27.766 --> 24:30.700
Honey?
That's dinner.

24:30.735 --> 24:33.572
If the crazy bitch shows up, we'll
just snuff her and ditch the remains.

24:33.939 --> 24:36.741
It's nice to see you
too, Teddy. Hey.

24:36.975 --> 24:39.411
How'd she get in here?

24:39.446 --> 24:41.746
Hi. Mmm!

24:48.587 --> 24:50.589
Laura.

24:51.089 --> 24:53.091
Okay, what the hell was that?

24:53.126 --> 24:56.059
Laura, talk to me.

24:56.094 --> 24:59.563
Okay, you're mad.
I'm getting that.

24:59.598 --> 25:02.399
You know what, sweetheart, I'm mad
too. You crossed the line back there.

25:02.434 --> 25:06.771
Just because we live together doesn't give you
license to bug out on me in front of the crew.

25:06.806 --> 25:10.108
Now you wanna bug out within the
confines of these four walls, that's fine.

25:10.143 --> 25:13.577
Don't do it
in front of the guys.

25:13.612 --> 25:17.080
Don't play games with me, Laura. Who
is playing games? You look at yourself.

25:17.115 --> 25:21.620
What are you talking about? You're ready to
ride this all the way to the end of the line.

25:21.655 --> 25:24.122
Tell me, what did I do?
The nurse, goddamn it!

25:24.157 --> 25:26.625
The bitch getting you
the pills, huh?

25:26.660 --> 25:28.627
You got a siren
going off now?

25:31.630 --> 25:33.632
Laura, baby, let me
explain. See-- No.

25:33.667 --> 25:35.599
You had that chance,
and you blew that.

25:35.634 --> 25:37.636
So now anything you say
is just damage control.

25:38.136 --> 25:42.140
Get out! Get out! Let me just
pack. Laura, baby, don't go.

25:42.175 --> 25:45.644
I will break your goddamn
face, 'cause I am ready!

25:45.679 --> 25:47.646
Get out!

25:51.650 --> 25:56.655
Pack.
Pack right now.

25:59.157 --> 26:00.926
What the hell you doing?
Hey. Straighten up.

26:01.192 --> 26:05.263
There are two hot chicks in a party full of
gay guys. It's like catching fish in a barrel.

26:06.498 --> 26:08.465
It's "shooting fish."

26:08.500 --> 26:12.504
What? It's "shooting fish in a barrel"
is the expression, you dumb-ass.

26:12.539 --> 26:15.274
Yeah, but if they're in the
barrel, why would you shoot them?

26:15.309 --> 26:18.009
Why wouldn't you just reach in
with your hands and pull one out?

26:19.511 --> 26:23.014
Let's just-- Come on, let's just
go, uh-- let's go hit on the girls.

26:25.350 --> 26:27.150
Hey!

26:27.185 --> 26:31.022
What's up?
Hi, I'm Mike.

26:31.256 --> 26:35.126
This is Sean. We work
for the fire department.

26:36.361 --> 26:39.631
Did you guys, uh, by any chance
get your tickets yet?

26:39.666 --> 26:42.184
Tickets for what?

26:42.219 --> 26:44.703
The gun show?

26:54.713 --> 26:59.182
Candy better hustle. Sondra's
gonna be here any minute. Yeah.

26:59.217 --> 27:03.221
You listen to me. Don't panic, but I
have to piss like a race horse. Okay?

27:03.622 --> 27:06.122
Go against the house.
No.

27:06.157 --> 27:10.161
I'm not gonna pull my cock out in this crowd.
That'd be like throwing chum into a shark tank.

27:10.662 --> 27:15.166
I'm gonna go inside. Hey,
Tommy, don't, all right?

27:15.201 --> 27:17.168
I'm drunk,
I'm vulnerable.

27:17.636 --> 27:22.173
A sweet piece of meat like me, I
won't last five minutes out here.

27:22.208 --> 27:24.676
Be brave.
They can smell fear.

27:25.110 --> 27:27.579
Bye.

27:31.583 --> 27:34.551
Kenny.

27:34.586 --> 27:36.588
Oh, thank God.

27:45.096 --> 27:49.434
You coming in? Inside
that house? Never again.

27:49.469 --> 27:51.269
Stop.

27:51.770 --> 27:55.273
Mom's inside having the time of her life,
and you're out here sulking like a child.

27:55.308 --> 27:58.109
You keep swallowing that anger,
it's gonna eat you alive, Pop.

27:58.144 --> 28:00.076
We're going in
circles here, kid.

28:00.111 --> 28:02.947
I don't know why you insist upon
throwing this in my face all the time.

28:03.314 --> 28:07.285
This is the way I live.
I thought you understood.

28:07.652 --> 28:10.086
I understand.
I understand just fine.

28:10.121 --> 28:12.088
It doesn't mean I have to
be surrounded by it.

28:12.123 --> 28:15.460
Your friends seem to be having a good
time. Why can't you? Just go ahead inside.

28:15.495 --> 28:17.962
Dad, if you just give it a chance--
Go inside, I'm grilling. Hmm?

28:17.997 --> 28:20.298
Go!

28:20.799 --> 28:22.801
Enjoy your party.

28:27.706 --> 28:31.207
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

28:31.242 --> 28:34.245
It's okay. I'm about done. Oh. Okay.

28:35.747 --> 28:41.217
Interested? Uh, yeah.
Wh-What do you got?

28:41.252 --> 28:46.257
Everything. "E," uppers, downers, Z's,
vikes, perks. Wow, you got vikes, huh?

28:46.292 --> 28:50.261
Sure. Close the door. My lover
sees us, he'll pitch a fit.

28:50.296 --> 28:52.531
So, uh, how much,
uh, for two?

28:52.566 --> 28:54.766
No. It's okay.
No. No money.

28:55.266 --> 28:57.734
Really?
Yeah.

28:57.769 --> 28:59.736
Thanks.
No problem.

28:59.771 --> 29:02.273
Thank you.
Share the wealth, right?

29:02.308 --> 29:04.776
Yeah. Do you mind?
I have to actually--

29:06.277 --> 29:08.279
A little privacy?

29:08.780 --> 29:11.783
I gave you the pills. How
about a little something for me?

29:12.250 --> 29:14.751
Whoa!

29:14.786 --> 29:16.788
Cock tease!

29:17.288 --> 29:21.292
Crazy little bitch.
Oh, come on. Whew!

29:21.793 --> 29:24.761
Yeah?

29:24.796 --> 29:28.264
I got news, Tom. Janet's
back. She's upstairs right now.

29:28.299 --> 29:31.302
Shit. How'd she find out where we
were? I'm not at liberty to say.

29:31.337 --> 29:34.305
You want your little man-on-man
blow job secret to hit the streets?

29:34.340 --> 29:36.272
- Johnny called her.
- Okay, listen.

29:36.307 --> 29:38.926
Lock that place down. Make sure
you keep Janet in your sights.

29:38.961 --> 29:41.546
- I'll be there as fast as I can, all right?
- I'm on it.

29:45.049 --> 29:48.017
Baby, baby, wait a second.
Now just listen, okay?

29:48.052 --> 29:50.555
Now, look, th-that was the old
me. All right, the drugged up me.

29:51.055 --> 29:53.057
I-I was just-- I was hitting
that to get the pills.

29:53.558 --> 29:57.278
Wow! That makes me feel so much better
about you as a person. Get out of my way.

29:57.313 --> 30:00.964
Baby, baby, listen to me. I've changed,
okay? I'm clean. Things are different.

30:00.999 --> 30:04.736
Yeah, things are different, and you're
clean, but you're never gonna change, Franco.

30:05.236 --> 30:07.739
You're going to spend the rest of your
life being led around by your cock...

30:08.239 --> 30:12.076
and doing whatever or whoever feels
good and to hell with the rest of us.

30:12.111 --> 30:13.877
I'm not an idiot.

30:13.912 --> 30:16.379
I didn't actually think
I could change you.

30:16.414 --> 30:19.417
I just thought we'd get a good
couple of years out of each other.

30:19.452 --> 30:22.652
And instead I got a mediocre
month and a half. Baby--

30:22.687 --> 30:26.925
Maybe you should just warn the
next person that comes along that...

30:26.960 --> 30:28.892
that's all you
really got in you.

30:28.927 --> 30:32.764
You know, before she's
stupid enough to fall.

30:33.765 --> 30:36.267
Take care of yourself.

30:36.302 --> 30:38.269
Laura.

30:41.339 --> 30:44.108
- I'm sorry, but I don't buy it.
- There's no way that you guys have dabbled.

30:44.143 --> 30:47.946
Of course we have. Yeah. Mike--
Mike here dabbled last night.

30:47.981 --> 30:50.079
Yeah, sure. I-I
dabbled. Tell-Tell them.

30:50.114 --> 30:53.952
I mean, Sean here, he dabbled some
guy in the garage, like, half hour ago.

30:53.987 --> 30:55.919
Dabbled the shit
out of him.

30:55.954 --> 30:57.789
You're just saying that 'cause
you know we're into gay guys.

30:58.289 --> 31:01.292
Yeah, what, you want us
to prove it?

31:01.327 --> 31:04.062
Yeah.

31:06.331 --> 31:09.801
Thanks for coming, by the way. Hey,
I'm glad I got out of class in time.

31:09.836 --> 31:13.770
Class?
Um, I'm finishing my M.B.A.

31:13.805 --> 31:18.274
One semester to go. Criminal
justice. Why the hell not?

31:18.309 --> 31:22.313
You didn't think I was gonna
make a career out of this? No.

31:22.348 --> 31:24.315
There she is.

31:58.516 --> 32:01.953
Hey. Who the hell's
down here?

32:02.353 --> 32:04.320
Get out!

32:04.355 --> 32:06.357
Get the hell out!

32:08.359 --> 32:10.862
I'm surrounded by this shit.

32:20.071 --> 32:23.875
Anyway, we spent the most amazing
three days in the Berkshires.

32:23.910 --> 32:26.544
We knew right after that
it was true love.

32:26.579 --> 32:30.847
Right, bunny?
Right, Linda.

32:30.882 --> 32:35.653
- Yeah, he's usually not so shy. A few too
many cocktails. -You know, which reminds me--

32:35.688 --> 32:39.856
Um, sweetie pie, I'm gonna go
to the car and get my cigarettes.

32:39.891 --> 32:42.727
Why don't you keep our new friend,
Sondra, company here for a while?

32:42.762 --> 32:44.729
Okay.

32:58.409 --> 33:00.912
She's very affectionate.

33:58.302 --> 34:02.223
Hey, sister, go, sister
soul sister, flow, sister

34:02.258 --> 34:06.144
Hey, sister, go, sister
soul sister, go, sister

34:06.179 --> 34:10.148
He met Marmalade
down in old New Orleans

34:14.152 --> 34:18.156
She said, hello Hey, Joe
you wanna give it a go

34:18.190 --> 34:22.159
Mm-Hmm Gitchi, gitchi Ya, ya, da, da

34:22.195 --> 34:25.496
Gitchi, gitchi
Ya, ya, here

34:33.603 --> 34:36.806
Ahh

34:36.841 --> 34:40.945
Voulez-vous coucher
avec moi, ce soir

34:40.980 --> 34:44.181
Voulez-vous coucher
avec moi

34:45.683 --> 34:48.186
Voulez-vous coucher
avec moi

34:59.697 --> 35:03.166
Come on, baby.
Listen, I--

35:03.201 --> 35:05.668
Uh, I-I got to--
I got to get back.

35:05.703 --> 35:09.207
Ravage me, Kenny. Uh,
Sondra. Sondra. Sondra.

35:09.707 --> 35:14.677
No! No, okay.
Just stop, okay?

35:14.712 --> 35:19.217
Candy's waiting for me. Voulez-vous
coucher avec moi, ce soir

35:19.252 --> 35:22.685
Who's Candy? Ken?

35:22.720 --> 35:26.057
Hello? Hey, you
backstabbing son of a bitch.

35:26.424 --> 35:28.409
Oh, hey, Tom. You're supposed
to be my brother, asshole.

35:28.444 --> 35:30.394
I am your brother. I was
just trying to do you a favor.

35:30.895 --> 35:33.397
By helping Janet take my kids again?
That's supposed to be doing me a favor?

35:33.432 --> 35:36.532
How's that work? Tommy, if
you would just listen to her.

35:36.567 --> 35:39.737
You know what, Johnny? You're dead to
me. You're dead to me. You got that?

35:39.772 --> 35:41.804
Look, those kids need
their mother, all right?

35:41.839 --> 35:44.708
You cannot handle this on
your own, and you know it.

35:44.743 --> 35:47.078
Hey. Hey. Hey. You take a
look in the mirror pal, okay?

35:47.113 --> 35:49.378
Look at your own kids, all
right? One's in reform school,

35:49.413 --> 35:52.250
the other one's already headed down the
same road, and you're talking about me?

35:52.285 --> 35:54.252
I don't think so.
That's my point exactly.

35:54.752 --> 35:58.756
Look, Tommy, what my divorce did to
those kids, I-I can't fix that, all right?

35:58.791 --> 36:01.224
But you, you got a chance
to make things right.

36:01.259 --> 36:04.762
Look, for once in your life,
stop thinking about what you want.

36:04.797 --> 36:06.729
Stop thinking about
what Janet wants.

36:06.764 --> 36:08.731
Start thinking about those kids
and what they need.

36:08.766 --> 36:12.770
- Because without them, Tommy, you got nothing.
- Ah, shut up.

36:12.805 --> 36:15.606
Tommy? Hello? Mother--

36:19.377 --> 36:21.379
What are you looking at?

36:23.881 --> 36:27.885
Now he's at home
doing 9:00 to 5:00

36:27.920 --> 36:31.587
Living his gray
flannel life

36:31.622 --> 36:35.626
When he turns off to sleep
Old memories keep

36:35.661 --> 36:40.196
More, more, more

36:40.231 --> 36:42.967
Gitchi, gitchi
Ya, ya, da, da

36:44.468 --> 36:47.971
Gitchi, gitchi
Ya, ya, here

36:48.006 --> 36:51.440
Mocca chocolata
Ya, ya

36:51.475 --> 36:55.980
I'm really sorry things didn't work out
with Sondra. I wish I could have done more.

36:56.480 --> 37:00.484
You know what? Things
worked out... just fine.

37:01.986 --> 37:03.953
You're not driving,
are you?

37:03.988 --> 37:06.490
Me? No. I'm gonna probably
just crash here tonight.

37:08.492 --> 37:11.996
I could offer you a ride.
No charge.

37:13.998 --> 37:16.000
Let's go.

37:19.503 --> 37:22.673
- Hey.
- Daddy!

37:22.907 --> 37:24.442
Hey.
Daddy, I missed you.

37:24.942 --> 37:27.011
Hey, sweetie,
what's going on?

37:27.511 --> 37:30.281
- Um, Mommy and Daddy need to catch up.
- Who wants ice cream?

37:30.548 --> 37:33.017
I do. Do all you guys like pistachio?

37:33.052 --> 37:35.036
Yup! Yeah? You like steak?

37:35.071 --> 37:36.986
Yup!
Yeah, all right.

37:37.021 --> 37:42.026
Uh, Jeffrey. Another
tall one, huh? Jeff?

37:42.061 --> 37:45.013
So, uh, what gives?

37:45.048 --> 37:47.930
I want to talk.

37:47.965 --> 37:52.703
I will sell my truck, I will
borrow money from loan sharks,

37:53.204 --> 37:55.206
I will be my own-- I
don't want to go to court.

37:58.042 --> 38:01.879
You try taking these kids away from me
again-- I don't want to take them again.

38:03.247 --> 38:07.218
Now this whole thing,
I didn't get angry.

38:08.753 --> 38:11.187
I got sad.

38:11.222 --> 38:14.225
You know, my head went right
back to when we first met.

38:17.061 --> 38:21.232
Our wedding
and how funny you were.

38:23.067 --> 38:25.534
Colleen being born.

38:25.569 --> 38:30.240
Those Beatles songs you used to
sing to her to make her fall asleep.

38:30.275 --> 38:34.912
Those sweet, little horse crayon
pictures you used to draw for Katy.

38:50.094 --> 38:54.598
Uh. Tommy, I couldn't even
move for almost a day,

38:54.633 --> 38:57.935
and then I couldn't
stop crying.

39:09.113 --> 39:11.949
I need my kids.

39:13.451 --> 39:16.454
But at least three or four
times a day when I had them,

39:16.954 --> 39:19.922
Katy and Connor would look at me
and ask where you were.

39:19.957 --> 39:24.729
Is Daddy coming for the weekend?
Is Daddy coming for Christmas?

39:25.129 --> 39:29.633
Where's Daddy now?
Is Daddy dead?

39:31.435 --> 39:33.804
You would tell us if Daddy
was dead, right, Mom?

39:36.640 --> 39:41.645
I, uh-- I was in a hospital
for a couple of weeks.

39:42.146 --> 39:44.982
But I got some counseling,

39:45.017 --> 39:47.818
and I got back up
on my feet.

39:50.755 --> 39:54.223
The thing is,
while I was there,

39:54.258 --> 39:57.595
I got my head straightened out enough
that I got a little perspective.

39:59.764 --> 40:01.731
And I think,

40:01.766 --> 40:05.669
for the sake of the kids...

40:06.170 --> 40:08.172
and for what
we used to be like...

40:10.608 --> 40:13.110
before Jimmy died,

40:16.614 --> 40:19.450
I think we ought to
give it one last go.

40:28.192 --> 40:30.194
One last go.

40:31.695 --> 40:37.701
That's a hell of a way to
jump start a relationship.

40:39.703 --> 40:42.640
Till death do us part.

40:42.675 --> 40:46.327
Right?
Right.

40:46.362 --> 40:49.980
Come to me now

40:52.483 --> 40:56.487
And lay your hands over me

40:56.522 --> 40:59.455
Even if it's a lie

40:59.490 --> 41:02.993
Say it will be all right

41:03.028 --> 41:06.997
I shall believe

41:08.499 --> 41:11.001
Broken in two

41:13.504 --> 41:17.842
'Cause I know
you're onto me

41:17.877 --> 41:20.979
That I only come home

41:21.014 --> 41:24.683
When I'm so all alone

41:24.718 --> 41:28.352
But I do believe

41:30.087 --> 41:35.526
That not everything is gonna to
be the way you think it ought to be

41:35.561 --> 41:38.362
Seems like every time
I try to make it right

41:38.397 --> 41:40.364
It all comes down on me

41:40.865 --> 41:43.399
Please say honestly

41:43.434 --> 41:47.237
You won't give up on me

41:47.272 --> 41:51.041
And I shall believe

41:53.777 --> 41:57.715
And I shall believe

41:58.716 --> 42:01.719
Open the door

42:04.221 --> 42:08.225
Show me your faith tonight

42:09.460 --> 42:11.427
I know it's true

42:11.462 --> 42:14.465
No one heals me like you

42:14.965 --> 42:18.836
And you hold the key

42:20.304 --> 42:23.641
Never again

42:25.142 --> 42:28.479
Will I turn away from you

42:30.481 --> 42:32.483
I'm so happy tonight

42:32.983 --> 42:35.986
That your love
is all right

42:36.021 --> 42:39.490
And I do believe

42:41.692 --> 42:47.164
That not everything is gonna to
be the way you think it ought to be

42:47.199 --> 42:50.100
It seems like every time
I try to make it right

42:50.135 --> 42:52.753
It all comes down on me

42:52.788 --> 42:55.337
Please say honestly

42:55.372 --> 42:59.843
You won't give up on me

42:59.878 --> 43:03.347
I shall believe

43:05.349 --> 43:08.852
I shall believe

43:10.354 --> 43:13.357
I shall believe

43:16.060 --> 43:19.029
I shall believe

44:09.279 --> 44:10.247
Cloudland.
