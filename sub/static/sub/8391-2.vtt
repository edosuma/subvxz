THEN IT'S JUST GONNA BE
A WHOLE THING

08:23.880 --> 08:26.326
WHERE THEY ACTUALLY...

08:26.470 --> 08:29.291
AND ASHLEY AND SYDNEY,
WHEW, THEY ARE BEST FRIENDS.

08:29.430 --> 08:32.228

08:41.790 --> 08:43.166
SHE SEEMED LIKE
A REALLY NICE GIRL.

08:43.310 --> 08:44.538
MAYBE SHE MESSED UP.

YOU WANNA GIVE HER
A SECOND SHOT,

08:45.660 --> 08:46.581
SEE HOW IT GOES?

08:46.730 --> 08:47.958

GOING TO HATE ME.

08:51.150 --> 08:52.720

09:52.900 --> 09:54.344
- AH, SHE JUST
WALKED INTO MY OFFICE.

09:54.490 --> 09:56.446
- SHE JUST WALKED IN?
THAT'S KIND OF WEIRD.

09:56.590 --> 09:58.649

10:27.970 --> 10:29.346
WHY DOES HE GET TO EAT
IN THE CAR, AND I DON'T?

10:29.490 --> 10:31.754
WHY DOES HE GET TO--
- BECAUSE NOEL'S PARENTS

10:31.900 --> 10:34.585

PICK UP AT BERKELEY COFFEE.

15:00.140 --> 15:01.129
SO I DON'T NEED.
- OH, WELL...

15:01.270 --> 15:03.238
TODAY I SAVED YOU,
LIKE, $12.

15:03.380 --> 15:06.304
- THAT'S MY SPECIAL BLEND
COFFEE.

15:06.450 --> 15:07.963
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THESE,
I'M GONNA PUT ON LATER.

15:08.110 --> 15:09.031
GORGEOUS TO LOOK AT.
COMFORTABLE TO WEAR.

15:09.180 --> 15:10.249
- WHAT, ARE YOU
PLANNING ON

15:10.390 --> 15:11.414
SPENDING THE NIGHT
AT THE OFFICE?

15:11.560 --> 15:12.379
WHAT IS ALL THIS?

15:12.530 --> 15:13.383
- LOOK, THE KIDS MADE ME LUNCH.

15:13.530 --> 15:14.519
I THINK
THEY ACTUALLY MISS ME...

15:14.670 --> 15:15.659
FROM BEING GONE
24 HOURS A DAY.

15:15.810 --> 15:17.038
- THAT'S REALLY SWEET.

15:17.190 --> 15:18.145
CAN YOU HOLD THESE
SO I CAN BACK OUT OF HERE?

15:18.290 --> 15:19.393
- OKAY. ONE SECOND.

15:19.530 --> 15:20.940
WHAT IS THIS
WE'RE LISTENING TO?

15:21.090 --> 15:22.671

15:22.810 --> 15:24.254
BUT CAN WE LISTEN TO--

15:24.400 --> 15:25.606
WELL, ACT UALLY--

15:25.750 --> 15:27.331
I DON'T THINK I--
- CAN YOU JUST TAKE THESE?

15:27.470 --> 15:28.778
- JUST PUT IT HERE.
- SEE, THIS IS NOT GONNA WORK.

15:28.920 --> 15:29.716
IT DOESN'T--
YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:31.240 --> 15:32.639
- SO HERE'S
WHAT I'VE BEEN THINKING.

15:32.790 --> 15:34.405
I FEEL LIKE THE DESIGN TEAM
IS NOT THINKING BIG ENOUGH.

15:34.550 --> 15:36.199
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:36.340 --> 15:37.409
- JUST NOT THINKING
MODERN ENOUGH AND HIP ENOUGH,

15:37.550 --> 15:39.689
AND I--I JUST WANT
TO KEEP BRAINSTORMING.

15:39.830 --> 15:41.309
- SARAH, IT'S GONNA BE FINE.
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

15:41.450 --> 15:43.509
BUT LISTEN, SO WHAT IF
IT HAD A PERSONALIZED--

15:43.660 --> 15:46.106
- OH, MY GOD!

15:46.250 --> 15:47.456
LIKE ON THOSE GREETING CARDS,

15:49.460 --> 15:51.041
I'M JUST SAYING
LET'S THINK BIGGER--

15:51.190 --> 15:53.329
- I HAVE TO STOP
AT BERKELEY COFFEE, OKAY?

15:53.460 --> 15:56.668

[SlghS]

15:56.810 --> 15:57.913
[indistinct chatter]

15:58.060 --> 15:59.869

WITH ISABEL, I GUESS.

16:22.770 --> 16:23.907

16:24.050 --> 16:25.074
I DON'T KNOW

16:26.840 --> 16:27.943
OKAY, SO...

16:28.090 --> 16:29.284

16:33.920 --> 16:35.603

UNBELIEVABLE.

17:06.920 --> 17:08.467

17:45.270 --> 17:46.988
EVERYTHING.
[laughs]

17:47.130 --> 17:48.336

17:48.480 --> 17:51.369
SHAPED LIKE A BURGER

AN AUTISTIC KID TOO,

18:48.610 --> 18:50.157
AND SO THE KIDS
PLAY TOGETHER.

18:50.300 --> 18:51.813
PHIL'S MARRIAGE
IS KIND OF FALLING APART.

18:51.950 --> 18:54.009
SO ADAM AND KRISTINA HAVE
BEEN WATCHING PHIL'S KID...

18:54.160 --> 18:55.468
HE'S A FRIEND.

18:55.610 --> 18:58.261
- I'LL TAKE A RAIN CHECK
ON THAT PUDDING.

18:58.410 --> 19:00.093
MORE FOR ME.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.231
- OH.

19:04.930 --> 19:06.613
OH, YOU MIGHT
WANT TO DO SOMETHING

19:06.760 --> 19:08.307
ABOUT THAT LIGHTER FLUID
THERE.

19:08.450 --> 19:11.203
- THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

19:11.350 --> 19:12.863
SHOULD STOW THAT SOMEWHERE.

19:20.330 --> 19:21.774
- SO, UH...

19:21.910 --> 19:24.185
WHERE'S JABBAR'S ROOM?

19:24.330 --> 19:26.605
- OH, IT'S JUST THE ONE ROOM.

19:26.750 --> 19:28.468
IT'S PRETTY COZY.

19:28.610 --> 19:30.089
- YEAH, TOUR IS ONLY
FOR FOUR WEEKS, MOM.

19:30.230 --> 19:32.812
- WELL, I'M JUST CURIOUS,
WHERE'S THE BOY GOING TO SLEEP?

19:32.960 --> 19:34.643
- WELL, IN THE PAST,
HE'S SLEPT THERE.

19:34.790 --> 19:38.237
- HERE?
ON THIS RICKETY CHAIR?

19:38.380 --> 19:39.824
- WELL, IT'S A COUCH.

19:39.970 --> 19:42.177
AND IT'S MORE COMFORTABLE
THAN IT LOOKS.

19:42.310 --> 19:45.620
BUT I HAVE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT GETTING A SLEEPING BAG,

19:45.770 --> 19:46.998
MAYBE, FOR ME,

19:47.150 --> 19:50.802
AND THEN PUTTING JABBAR
ON THE FULL-SIZE BED.

19:50.940 --> 19:53.329
- TRUST ME, MOM.
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

19:53.460 --> 19:54.529
IT'S GONNA BE JUST FINE.

19:54.670 --> 19:55.830
- WHATEVER YOU SAY, HONEY.

19:55.980 --> 19:57.493
JUST KNOW THAT HE'S
GOT A BED AT MY PLACE

19:57.640 --> 19:59.460
IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT.

20:01.780 --> 20:05.409
WELL, LET'S HAVE
SOME WAFFLES, HUH?

20:05.540 --> 20:08.429
- SO HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT
TELLING MAX

20:08.580 --> 20:10.787
THAT YOU AND KRISTINA
WERE SEPARATED?

20:10.930 --> 20:13.546
- WELL, PHIL, I DON'T THINK
THAT CRISTINA AND I WOULD--

20:13.690 --> 20:15.134
- NEITHER DID I, MY FRIEND.
NEITHER DID I.

20:15.280 --> 20:18.204
AND THEN, BAM!
IT JUST HAPPENS.

20:18.350 --> 20:20.511
SUZE GOES TO SLEEP
TALKING ABOUT NOEL

20:20.660 --> 20:22.343
AND WAKES UP FEEDING HIM.

20:22.490 --> 20:25.527
SPENDS ALL DAY DRIVING AROUND
TO THE THERAPIES.

20:25.670 --> 20:28.559
AND BY THE TIME SHE GETS HOME
AT NIGHT, IT'S JUST...

20:28.710 --> 20:31.463
I LOVE HIM.
I LOVE HIM TO DEATH.

20:31.600 --> 20:34.364
IT'S JUST THAT THERE
IS NO "US" LEFT.

20:34.500 --> 20:35.603
CAN I CONFIDE IN YOU, ADAM?

20:35.750 --> 20:37.149
- WELL, PHIL,
I THINK IT MIGHT BE BEST--

20:37.300 --> 20:38.437
- DO YOU REMEMBER
OUR PINK CARDS

20:38.580 --> 20:40.127
FROM OUR INDEX CARD SYSTEM?

20:40.270 --> 20:41.339
- VAGUELY.

20:41.480 --> 20:43.789
- OUR SEX CARDS.

20:43.930 --> 20:45.750

OUR "FORNICARDS."

20:45.890 --> 20:47.471
- YEAH.

20:47.620 --> 20:51.067

THEY STARTED PILING UP.

20:51.210 --> 20:52.484
UNUSED.

20:54.280 --> 20:55.861
[indistinct conversation]

20:56.010 --> 20:57.728

22:54.330 --> 22:55.467
[playing mellow rock]

22:55.610 --> 23:02.470
I WAS WITH YOU
WHEN THE WAR BEGAN

23:02.620 --> 23:06.579
A WAR WITH YOU
MY MEMORY RAN

23:06.730 --> 23:08.891
- I THINK I'M A GENIUS.

23:09.040 --> 23:13.488
- WHEN I KEPT YOU
TUCKED AWAY

23:13.630 --> 23:15.006
BOO!
- OH, MY GOD.

23:15.150 --> 23:16.936
OH, HEY!

23:17.080 --> 23:18.729
- YOU ALWAYS RETURNED
- MISS ME?

23:18.880 --> 23:19.904
- I DID.

23:20.050 --> 23:21.733
- COULDN'T STAY AWAY
FOR A WHOLE DAY.

23:21.880 --> 23:23.734
- I COULDN'T.
GOOD BAND.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.393
- RIGHT?
THEY'RE REALLY GOOD.

23:25.540 --> 23:27.258
WHAT'S GOING ON?

23:27.400 --> 23:29.539
- WELL...

23:29.680 --> 23:30.601
JUST MY MOTHER.

23:30.750 --> 23:31.842
BUGGIN' ME.

23:31.990 --> 23:33.196
- UH-HUH.

23:33.340 --> 23:34.921
- YEAH.
- IMAGINE THAT.

23:35.060 --> 23:35.958
- [chuckles]

23:36.100 --> 23:38.716
- SHE THINKS THAT,
UH, JABBAR

23:38.860 --> 23:41.727
WILL BE BETTER OFF
STAYING WITH HER.

23:41.860 --> 23:43.748
- OH, I'M SO SHOCKED
TO HEAR THAT.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.128
- SHE'S SO OBSESSED
ABOUT THAT BOAT.

23:45.280 --> 23:47.339
- REALLY, I DIDN'T
GET THAT IMPRESSION

23:47.490 --> 23:48.627
WHEN SHE WAS
OVER FOR WAFFLES.

23:48.770 --> 23:49.839
SHE DOESN'T LIKE THE BOAT?

23:49.980 --> 23:52.619
- NO, SHE DOES NOT
LIKE THE BOAT.

23:52.770 --> 23:54.078
AND SHE'S GOT THIS
WHOLE THING THAT, YOU KNOW,

23:54.220 --> 23:56.802
LIKE HE'S STAYED WITH HER
BEFORE LONG-TERM,

23:56.950 --> 23:59.282
AND HE'S ONLY STAYED WITH YOU
FOR, LIKE, A NIGHT OR TWO.

23:59.430 --> 24:00.840
- MM-HMM.
- SO SHE'S...

24:00.990 --> 24:03.572
- THEN YOU REMINDED HER
THAT I WAS HIS FATHER

24:03.710 --> 24:07.339
AND THAT WASN'T REALLY
ANY OF HER CONCERN?

24:07.480 --> 24:09.573
- YEAH.
YEAH, I DID.

24:14.170 --> 24:18.413
- IT'S BEEN YEARS
SINCE I SAW YOU LAST

24:21.140 --> 24:24.621
- HOW DO YOU FEEL?

24:24.770 --> 24:26.829
- ME?
- YEAH.

24:26.980 --> 24:32.907
- I FEEL LIKE IT'S SOMETHING
TO DISCUSS.

24:33.050 --> 24:34.256
- MEANING...

24:34.400 --> 24:37.187
- MEANING I DON'T THINK
MY MOTHER'S COMPLETELY WRONG.

24:37.330 --> 24:40.436
- RIGHT. SEE, I'M ASKING YOU
HOW YOUFEEL,

24:40.580 --> 24:41.717
AND YOU KEEP SAYING,

24:41.850 --> 24:42.851
"MY MOTHER THIS,"
AND "MY MOTHER THIS."

24:42.990 --> 24:44.742
I DIDN'T HAVE A KID
WITH YOUR MOM!

24:44.890 --> 24:47.859
- OKAY, I--I THINK THAT
HE'D BE BETTER OFF WITH HER.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.968
NO, I MEAN, HE'S GOT
HIS OWN ROOM THERE.

24:50.100 --> 24:51.681
HE'S COMFORTABLE.

24:51.830 --> 24:52.865
HE'S KNOWN HIS GRANDMOTHER
HIS WHOLE LIFE.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.240
- YEAH, WELL, I'M HIS DAD.

24:54.380 --> 24:57.099
- AND...YOU'LL SEE HIM
EVERY DAY, CROSBY.

24:57.250 --> 24:58.342
- OH, IS THAT WHAT
YOU GUYS DECIDED,

24:58.490 --> 24:59.969
THAT I CAN SEE HIM
EVERY DAY?

25:00.110 --> 25:01.213
YOU AND YOUR MOM
FIGURED THIS OUT?

25:01.360 --> 25:03.499
I DON'T THINK, LEGALLY,
YOU GUYS CAN JUST

25:03.640 --> 25:04.948
MAKE ALL THESE DECISIONS
WITHOUT ASKING ME.

25:05.080 --> 25:06.524
- NO, NO, NO.
WE'RE NOT GONNA GO THERE.

25:06.670 --> 25:07.876
- IT'S AN ELEMENT IN THIS.
YOU CAN'T JUST--

25:08.020 --> 25:09.044
- NO, IT'S NOT AN ELEMENT.

25:09.190 --> 25:10.987
IT'S NOT--
HAS NOTHING TO DO--

25:11.130 --> 25:12.051
NO ONE'S TALKING
ABOUT YOUR RIGHTS!

25:12.200 --> 25:13.531
IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

25:13.680 --> 25:14.715
I JUST WANNA DO
WHAT'S BEST FOR JABBAR.

25:14.850 --> 25:16.738
- YOU THINK GOING TO EUROPE
FOR SIX WEEKS

25:16.890 --> 25:18.403
IS WHAT'S BEST FOR JABBAR?

25:18.550 --> 25:20.814
THAT--WHAT PARENTING MAGAZINE
DID THAT COME FROM?

25:20.960 --> 25:21.756
- FIRST OF ALL,
GET YOUR FACTS RIGHT.

25:21.890 --> 25:23.334
IT'S FOUR WEEKS, NOT SIX.

25:23.480 --> 25:24.856
- OH, IT'S FOUR WEEKS.
THAT'S SO MUCH BETTER.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.308
- AND I'M NOT GOING EUROPE
ON SOME VACATION,

25:26.450 --> 25:27.485
LIKE I'M GOING TO BACKPACK
THROUGH EUROPE

25:27.620 --> 25:28.552
AND DUMP MY KID OVER HERE.

25:28.690 --> 25:29.759
IS THAT WHAT I'M DOING?

25:29.900 --> 25:31.720
- WELL, YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO CURE CANCER!

25:31.870 --> 25:33.007
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT EVEN...

25:33.150 --> 25:34.902
THIS IS CRAZY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

25:35.050 --> 25:36.358
ACTUALLY, HE'S STAYING
WITH MY MOTHER, SO DEAL WITH IT.

25:36.500 --> 25:38.286
- WELL, WE'LL SEE WHAT JULIA
THINKS ABOUT THAT.

25:38.430 --> 25:40.705
- I DON'T CARE ABOUT
WHAT YOUR SISTER HAS TO SAY!

25:40.840 --> 25:42.284
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
YOU WAN NA GET YOUR SISTER?

25:42.430 --> 25:43.909
REALLY? THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE IT TO?

25:44.050 --> 25:45.494
- NO, I--
- SEE WHAT I COME BACK WITH.

25:45.640 --> 25:47.744
GO GET YOUR SISTER!
- I DIDN'T MEA...

25:47.890 --> 25:50.677
[song ends]

25:50.820 --> 25:52.856
- HEY, CROSBY,
HOW WAS THAT TAKE, MAN?

25:52.990 --> 25:54.434
- I GOTTA BE HONEST, DUDE.

25:54.580 --> 25:56.093
I DIDN'T HEAR
THAT LAST TAKE.

25:59.100 --> 26:00.749
I'M SORRY.

26:03.250 --> 26:04.342
I MEAN, WHAT WOULD YOU DO
IF SOMEONE WAS TELLING YOU

26:04.490 --> 26:05.866
THEY DIDN'T WANT
YOUR SON TO LIVE WITH YOU?

26:06.010 --> 26:07.386
- WELL, I DON'T THINK

26:07.530 --> 26:09.589
THAT I WOULD EVER FIND MYSELF
IN THAT POSITION.

26:09.740 --> 26:10.832
- WELL, THAT SOUNDS
JUDGMENTAL.

26:10.980 --> 26:12.049
WHERE THE HELL
HAVE YOU BEEN?

26:12.190 --> 26:13.737
I NEED INPUT.

26:13.880 --> 26:15.086
- I HAD A MEETING.

26:15.220 --> 26:15.902
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU HAD A MEETING?

26:16.050 --> 26:17.426
- I MEAN--I DON'T KNOW.

26:17.570 --> 26:19.049
THE JUST BROUGHT ME ALONG
TO THE THING ABOUT THE LOGO.

26:19.190 --> 26:20.748
- THE LOGO MEETING?
- WHO CARES ABOUT THE LOGO?

26:20.880 --> 26:22.984
LISTEN, JASMINE'S TAKING OFF
FOR FOUR WEEKS,

26:23.130 --> 26:24.677
AND SHE WANTS JABBAR
TO STAY WITH HER MOM.

26:24.820 --> 26:26.048
- CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?
- WELL--

26:26.200 --> 26:27.849
- I MEAN,
THAT'S NOT RIGHT, IS IT?

26:28.000 --> 26:29.547
I MEAN, I SHOULD HAVE A SAY
IN THIS, DON'T YOU THINK?

26:29.690 --> 26:30.543
- OF COURSE YOU SHOULD
HAVE A SAY.

26:30.690 --> 26:31.714
- DON'T I HAVE A RIGHT?
RIGHT?

26:31.860 --> 26:33.168
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOUR RIGHTS ARE.

26:33.310 --> 26:34.060
YOU SHOULD CALL JULIA,
I MEAN, JUST TO KNOW--

26:34.210 --> 26:35.416
- I THINK THAT'S
AN EXCELLENT IDEA.

26:35.550 --> 26:36.687
- LET'S CALL HER.
- BY THE WAY, IT'S TREMENDOUS

26:36.830 --> 26:38.036
THAT YOU TWO
ARE WORKING TOGETHER NOW.

26:38.180 --> 26:39.101
IT REALLY SAVES ME
A LOT OF TIME.

26:39.250 --> 26:40.319
- THAT'S GOOD.

26:40.460 --> 26:41.961
WHAT WAS THE MEETING
ABOUT THE LOGO?

26:42.110 --> 26:43.031
- LOOKIT, YOU'RE GONNA CALL.
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

26:43.180 --> 26:44.044
- CALL JULIA.

26:46.320 --> 26:47.901
- I'M TIRED.

26:48.050 --> 26:49.324
- HI, JULIA BRAVERMAN,
PLEASE.

26:49.460 --> 26:50.495
- NO, PUT HER ON
THE VIDEO CONFERENCE.

26:50.640 --> 26:51.664
VIDEO CONFERENCE IS AWESOME.

26:51.810 --> 26:52.981
- YOU GUYS HAVE
VIDEO CONFERENCE?

26:53.120 --> 26:54.223
- AND THEN YOU CAN TALK TO HER
IN THE COMPUTER.

26:54.370 --> 26:56.088
- LIKE IN TRON.
- IT'S HER BROTHER ADAM.

26:56.230 --> 26:57.049
- DICK TRACY.
- PUT HER ON.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.713
- GUYS, GUYS.
UH-HUH.

26:58.850 --> 27:00.056
NO, I UNDERSTAND.
THANKS. OKAY, BYE.

27:00.200 --> 27:03.124
UH, SHE'S IN A VERY IMPORTANT
CONFERENCE CALL

27:03.270 --> 27:04.237
AND CANNOT BE DISTURBED.
- OH, GIVE ME A BREAK.

27:04.380 --> 27:06.302
THAT'S PRETTY OFFENSIVE.
THE THREE OF US?

27:06.450 --> 27:07.929
- BUT LISTEN,
HERE'S WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.

27:08.070 --> 27:09.651
YOU GOTTA TALK TO JASMINE,
AND YOU HAVE TO LET HER KNOW

27:09.800 --> 27:11.279
THAT SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE RIGHT
TO MAKE UNILATERAL DECISIONS

27:11.420 --> 27:13.559
ABOUT WHERE AND WITH WHOM
JABBAR IS GONNA LIVE

27:13.700 --> 27:15.179
WHILE SHE'S AWAY.

27:15.320 --> 27:16.696
THERE'S GOTTA BE A DIALOG.
- UNILATERAL, I LIKE THAT.

27:16.840 --> 27:18.284
- AND YOU HAVE TO BE READY
TO, YOU KNOW,

27:18.420 --> 27:19.830
PUT YOUR MONEY
WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS AND--

27:19.980 --> 27:21.356
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

27:21.500 --> 27:22.637
- LIKE MAYBE GET AN APARTMENT

27:22.770 --> 27:23.668
INSTEAD OF HAVING HIM
ON THE BOAT.

27:23.810 --> 27:24.708
- YEAH, WELL,
I CAN'T DO THAT

27:24.850 --> 27:26.158
BETWEEN RIGHT NOW
AND TOMORROW.

27:26.290 --> 27:27.325
SO ARE YOU SAYING--
- I JUST MEAN ARE YOU READY?

27:27.470 --> 27:28.983
- SHE'S JUST ASKING YOU
IF YOU THINK THAT

27:29.130 --> 27:30.563
THAT'S WHAT'S BEST
FOR JABBAR.

27:30.710 --> 27:32.359
I THINK THAT THAT'S THE QUESTION
YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF.

27:32.510 --> 27:33.954
- WAIT, SO YOU DON'T THINK
HE SHOULD BE WITH ME, EITHER?

27:34.100 --> 27:35.124
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.

27:35.270 --> 27:37.056
- THAT'S WHAT YOU GUYS
ARE BOTH--

27:37.200 --> 27:39.646
- I'M SAYING YOU SHOULD TAKE
SOME TIME AND THINK ABOUT IT.

27:39.790 --> 27:42.657
- [sighs]
I SHOULD TAKE SOME TIME.

27:42.790 --> 27:43.893
ALL RIGHT.
- SOMEWHERE ELSE.

27:44.040 --> 27:45.302
'CAUSE, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

27:45.450 --> 27:46.417
THIS IS ACTUALLY
A PLACE OF BUSINESS,

27:46.560 --> 27:47.754
AND I HAVE WORK TO DO.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.071
- I'M NOT GETTING
IN THE WAY OF YOUR WORK

27:49.210 --> 27:50.586
WITH YOUR LEG UP
ON THE DESK WHILE I'M THINKING.

27:50.730 --> 27:53.107
I'M SURE YOU CAN
MANAGE BOTH THINGS.

27:53.250 --> 27:54.626
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY,
YOU SIT THERE AND THINK,

27:54.770 --> 27:56.044
AND I'LL GET BACK TO WORK
AND FIND OUT

27:56.190 --> 27:57.566
JUST EXACTLY WHAT
THE HELL IS GOING ON

27:57.710 --> 27:58.699
WITH THE LOGO MEETING.

27:58.840 --> 28:00.011
- SEE WHAT I'M DEALING WITH?

28:00.160 --> 28:02.367
HE'S SO TENSE HERE,
ALL DAY.

28:02.500 --> 28:05.219
- I'VE BEEN REVIEWING A MENTAL
TRANSCRIPT OF THE CONVERSATION,

28:05.370 --> 28:07.122
AND, IN RETROSPECT,
I BELIEVE THAT MY COMMENTS

28:07.270 --> 28:08.646
WERE NOT ONLY APPROPRIATE,

28:08.790 --> 28:10.052
BUT THEY WERE
ENTIRELY JUSTIFIED.

28:10.200 --> 28:12.191
- JULIA, YOU ESSENTIALLY
TOLD THIS MOM

28:12.340 --> 28:13.819
THAT HER DAUGHTER
HAS ISSUES.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.131
- NO, I DID NOT.

28:15.270 --> 28:16.714
YOU'RE TWISTING MY WORDS,
COUNSELOR.

28:16.860 --> 28:17.997
- OH, NO, PLEASE.
NOT WITH THE LEGAL TALK.

28:18.140 --> 28:20.893
FREAKS ME OUT.
- ALL RIGHT...BABE.

28:21.040 --> 28:22.894
I WAS JUST
TRYING TO HELP SYDNEY

28:23.040 --> 28:24.029
OUT OF THIS WHOLE
PLAY DATE THING

28:24.180 --> 28:25.454
BY BEING HONEST
WITH THE WOMAN,

28:25.600 --> 28:28.068
AND SHE GOES AND WRITES ME
THIS ANGRY EMAIL.

28:28.220 --> 28:29.187
- WELL, WHAT EXACTLY
DID YOU SAY TO HER?

28:29.320 --> 28:31.049
- I SAID NOTHING.
- NOTHING?

28:31.190 --> 28:33.078
- MAYBE I SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT THERE BEING BAD BLOOD

28:33.220 --> 28:34.039
BETWEEN AMY G. AND ISABEL.

28:34.190 --> 28:36.351
- BAD--YOU SAID BAD BLOOD?

28:36.500 --> 28:38.673
[laughs]
WHAT IS THIS, THE GODFATHER?

28:38.820 --> 28:40.913
- THAT'S WHAT YOU TOLD ME.
IS THAT NOT THE TRUTH?

28:41.060 --> 28:43.267
- SWEETHEART, AMY G'S
MOM IS A POWERHOUSE.

28:43.410 --> 28:45.025
SHE'S THE PRESIDENT OF
THE PARENTS' ASSOCIATION.

28:45.170 --> 28:48.162
SO FIX THIS, OR THE WHOLE
MOTHERS MAFIA

28:48.310 --> 28:49.447
WILL PREVENT OUR DAUGHTER
EVER HAVING A PLAY DATE

28:49.580 --> 28:50.444
EVER AGAIN.

28:50.590 --> 28:51.477
- OKAY, HOW DO I FIX IT?

28:51.620 --> 28:52.894
- UH, TELL HER YOU WERE WRONG.

28:53.040 --> 28:54.268
- I'M NOT WRONG.

28:54.420 --> 28:55.557
I WILL NOT COMPROMISE
MY INTEGRITY.

28:55.690 --> 28:57.078
- OKAY, WELL, YOU CAN
KEEP YOUR INTEGRITY,

28:57.210 --> 28:58.837
AND OUR DAUGHTER WILL END UP
BITTER AND LONELY.

28:58.970 --> 29:00.210
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

29:00.350 --> 29:01.931
- UGH.

29:02.080 --> 29:04.457
TH ESE ARE FIVE-YEAR-OLDS.

29:04.600 --> 29:05.760
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEIR SOCIAL POLITICS

29:05.910 --> 29:06.979
ARE THIS COMPLICATED.

29:07.120 --> 29:09.429
- WELCOME TO MY HELL.

29:13.260 --> 29:14.818
- ALL RIGHT,
PICK ME UP TOMORROW?

29:14.960 --> 29:16.188
- YEAH.
- OKAY, THANKS.

29:16.340 --> 29:17.648
BYE!

29:17.790 --> 29:18.745
- OH, HEY, SARAH.

29:18.890 --> 29:21.120
WAIT.
[grunts]

29:21.270 --> 29:24.068
FORGOT YOUR COFFEE MUGS.
- THANK YOU.

29:24.210 --> 29:26.030
OKAY, SEE YA.
- HEY, YOU KNOW...

29:28.110 --> 29:30.249
FOR US NOT TO CARPOOL
ANYMORE.

29:30.380 --> 29:31.790
- YOU REALLY HATE MY COFFEE?

29:31.940 --> 29:33.555
- NO, NO, NO.
NO, IT'S JUST--IT'S--

29:33.700 --> 29:35.144
IT'S THE ONLY TIME OF THE DAY
THAT I GET TO BE BY MYSELF.

29:35.290 --> 29:36.734
NOTHING PERSONAL.
- I UNDERSTAND.

29:36.870 --> 29:38.428
NO, I REALLY DO UNDERSTAND.
- OKAY.

29:38.560 --> 29:39.902
- OKAY, I'LL MEET YOU THERE
TOMORROW.

29:40.050 --> 29:42.143
- THANKS.

29:42.290 --> 29:46.363
- HEY, UH, SARAH,

29:46.500 --> 29:48.707
ALSO, I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU
NOT TO TALK ABOUT...

29:48.850 --> 29:50.704
MAX OR MY PERSONAL LIFE
AT WORK.

29:50.850 --> 29:52.158

I DIDN'T--I MEAN--

29:52.300 --> 29:53.437
I DIDN'T MEAN TO GET
INTO IT, YOU KNOW.

29:53.580 --> 29:55.024
JUST PHIL LESSING--
- YEAH, I KNOW.

29:55.170 --> 29:56.398
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF.

29:56.550 --> 29:58.336
JUST DON'T DO IT.
- I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS A SECRET.

29:58.480 --> 30:00.209
- IT'S NOT A SECRET, SARAH,
IT'S MY PERSONAL LIFE,

30:00.350 --> 30:01.999
AND I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHOOSE
HOW AND WHEN

30:02.140 --> 30:03.482
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, OKAY.

30:03.620 --> 30:04.439
IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER THINGS
YOU'D LIKE TO DECIDE

30:04.590 --> 30:06.069
WHEN AND HOW
YOU TALK ABOUT THEM,

30:06.210 --> 30:08.269
JUST GIVE ME A HEAD'S UP,
JUST LET ME KNOW, JUST SO--

30:08.420 --> 30:10.035
- IT'S NOT SOMETHING I SHOULD
HAVE TO ASK YOU FOR.

30:11.320 --> 30:12.799
- YOU SHOULD JUST
RESPECT MY PRIVACY.

30:12.940 --> 30:14.760
- OH, GOD, ADAM,
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

30:14.910 --> 30:16.116
- AND I ALSO DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD BE

30:16.260 --> 30:20.117
SPENDING QUITE
SO MUCH TIME WITH GORDON.

30:20.260 --> 30:21.488
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

30:21.640 --> 30:24.461
- WELL...

30:24.610 --> 30:26.054
SARAH, I MEAN,
YOU HAD LUNCH WITH HIM

30:26.200 --> 30:27.337
FOR 77 MINUTES TODAY.

30:27.480 --> 30:30.233
- OH, MY GOD,
YOU TIMED OUR LUNCH?

30:30.380 --> 30:31.449
- I THINK HE MIGHT BE
GETTING THE WRONG IDEA.

30:31.580 --> 30:32.444
- GETTING THE WRONG IDEA?

30:32.580 --> 30:33.615
ADAM, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

30:33.760 --> 30:35.648
- YOU'RE JUST REALLY CHATTY.

30:35.790 --> 30:37.269
YOU WERE FLIRTING
WITH THE GUY.

30:37.420 --> 30:38.682
- I WASN'T BEING CHATTY
AND FLIRTY.

30:38.830 --> 30:40.343
I HAVE A PERSONALITY.
I HAD PUDDING AND--

30:40.490 --> 30:41.696
- LOOK, IT'S A DIFFERENT
KIND OF WORKPLACE, OKAY?

30:41.840 --> 30:42.864
IT'S NOT A BAR.

30:43.010 --> 30:44.728
- OOH! DON'T SAY THAT TO ME!

30:44.870 --> 30:46.212
I KNOW IT'S NOT A BAR.

30:46.360 --> 30:47.622
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME
IT'S NOT A BAR.

30:47.770 --> 30:49.692
I KNOW HOW TO CONDUCT MYSELF
OUTSIDE OF A BAR!

30:49.840 --> 30:51.250
- THIS GUY IS A DOG!

30:51.400 --> 30:52.799
HE'S NOT A GOOD GUY
FOR YOU TO GET INVOLVED WITH!

30:52.950 --> 30:55.225
- ...BY MYSELF, FOR MYSELF!
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP!

30:55.370 --> 30:56.701
- IT'S YOUR SECOND DAY
ON THE JOB!

30:56.850 --> 30:58.499
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HANGING OUT
FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF--

30:58.640 --> 31:01.643
- 77 MINUTES!
IT WAS ONLY 77 MINUTES.

31:01.790 --> 31:03.189
I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THIS.

31:03.340 --> 31:05.922
IT JUST FEELS LIKE YOU REGRET
DOING THIS AT ALL.

31:06.070 --> 31:07.378
- WELL, DON'T MAKE ME
REGRET IT.

31:07.520 --> 31:09.306
- OKAY, I WON'T
MAKE YOU REGRET IT.

31:09.450 --> 31:11.486
I QUIT.
- OH, OKAY.

31:11.620 --> 31:12.587
THAT'S A BIG SURPRISE.

31:12.730 --> 31:14.004
QUITTING IS DEFINITELY
THE ANSWER.

31:14.140 --> 31:15.516
- YOU CAN SEND MY MY $29 CHECK
OR WHATEVER YOU'RE PAYING ME

31:15.660 --> 31:17.799
FOR THIS GREAT INTERNSHIP
IN THE MAIL.

31:17.940 --> 31:19.453

31:51.940 --> 31:54.761
I FEEL LIKE THOSE BACKPACKS

31:54.910 --> 31:56.354
DID ANYONE DO ANYTHING, HUH?

31:56.500 --> 31:58.946
HEY, UM, DO YOU WANT ME

33:55.100 --> 33:56.476

BEING IN OUR HOUSE

IT'S JUST NOT IN ME,
AND...I'M SORRY.

34:08.560 --> 34:10.004

- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
YOU HIRED YOUR SISTER.

34:14.320 --> 34:15.662
SOMETHING I WOULDN'T DO.
- SHE QUIT.

34:15.810 --> 34:17.072
- SHE QUIT? WHY?

34:17.220 --> 34:18.949
- BECAUSE I CRITICIZED HER
FOR HAVING A TWO-HOUR LUNCH

34:19.090 --> 34:22.116
WITH GORDON, AND THEN
TALKING TO HIM ABOUT MAX.

34:24.060 --> 34:27.086
- MAYBE THAT'S BETTER,
THEN, SHE QUIT, YOU KNOW?

34:27.230 --> 34:28.197
- I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST, YOU KNOW,

34:28.340 --> 34:29.568
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T
HAVE HIRED SARAH.

34:29.720 --> 34:31.369

37:21.200 --> 37:23.361
AND SHE WAS,
UM, NOT HAPPY.

37:32.420 --> 37:34.035
WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN WE RUN OUT OF AMYS?

37:36.800 --> 37:39.519

THINK OF SOMETHING.

37:42.080 --> 37:44.423

SO SEDUCTIVELY.

37:44.570 --> 37:46.879
CLEVER GIRL.

38:05.550 --> 38:07.302
I OVERREACT ED TOO.
IT'S OKAY.

38:07.450 --> 38:10.032
- IT'S REALLY NOT OKAY,
BECAUSE...

38:10.180 --> 38:12.102
THINGS HAVE NOT BEEN GREAT
AT WORK, AS YOU KNOW,

38:12.250 --> 38:15.287

38:28.820 --> 38:30.674
HE WOULD PROBABLY FIRE ME.

38:30.820 --> 38:32.367
- HE'S NOT GONNA FIRE YOU.

38:32.510 --> 38:34.262
HE LIKES YOU.
YOU'RE INDISPENSABLE TO HIM.

38:34.410 --> 38:35.718
- DID HE SAY THAT TO YOU?

38:35.860 --> 38:38.897
- WELL, HE IMPLIED IT
IN 77 MINUTES.

38:39.040 --> 38:40.416
- NO, NO.
NOBODY'S INDISPENSABLE.

38:40.550 --> 38:42.438
NOT THESE DAYS.
NOT IN THIS ECONOMY, SO...

38:42.590 --> 38:43.864
- ADAM, YOU'RE TOO HARD
ON YOURSELF.

38:44.010 --> 38:45.034
RELAX, DON'T WORRY.

38:45.180 --> 38:47.489
YOU DO SUCH A GOOD JOB.
- [grumbles]

38:49.840 --> 38:51.523
SO, COME ON,
YOU'RE NOT REALLY QUITTING.

38:51.670 --> 38:53.217
SO...LET'S GO.

38:53.360 --> 38:55.464
- [scoffs]
YES, I AM QUITTING.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.181
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THINGS
HARDER FOR YOU.

38:57.330 --> 38:58.604
- SARAH, LISTEN TO ME.
OKAY?

38:58.750 --> 39:01.958
LOOK AT ME.
I WANT YOU THERE.

39:02.090 --> 39:03.534
OKAY?

39:06.580 --> 39:07.501
[chuckles]

39:07.650 --> 39:09.754
- [snickering]
- WHAT?

39:09.890 --> 39:11.471
I DO, I REALLY DO.
I WANT YOU THERE.

39:11.620 --> 39:12.587
- YOU DON'T REALLY
BELIEVE THAT.

39:12.720 --> 39:13.687
YOU COULDN'T EVEN
REALLY SAY IT.

39:13.830 --> 39:15.377
- I'M WORKING ON IT.
- [laughs]

39:15.520 --> 39:16.999
- SO COME ON,
WILL YOU GET DRESSED?

39:17.140 --> 39:18.243
LET'S GO TO WORK.

39:18.390 --> 39:19.345
- REALLY?
- YEAH. COME ON.

39:19.490 --> 39:20.718
- THIS IS SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

39:20.870 --> 39:22.246
YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.

39:22.390 --> 39:23.834
BECAUSE I WAS JUST
GETTING STARTED.

39:23.980 --> 39:25.971
I MEAN, I WAS JUST
GETTING IN A GROOVE, YOU KNOW?

39:26.120 --> 39:28.213
AND, UM, LISTEN, I WON'T
DO ANY OF THE STUFF

39:28.360 --> 39:29.566
THAT WAS BUGGING YOU, OKAY?

39:29.710 --> 39:30.916
I WON'T TALK ABOUT
YOUR PERSONAL LIFE.

39:31.050 --> 39:31.664
OH, BUT YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO TAKE ME TO WORK

39:31.810 --> 39:32.981
EVERY DAY THIS WEEK, OKAY,

39:33.120 --> 39:34.530
BECAUSE THE CAR
IS IN THE SHOP,

39:34.680 --> 39:36.398
AND, UM, CAN WE
PLAY SOME DIFFERENT MUSIC?

39:36.540 --> 39:37.609
- HEY, THAT'S
RAY LAMONTAGNE, OKAY?

39:37.750 --> 39:39.399
THE MAN'S A GENIUS.

39:39.540 --> 39:40.928
THAT'S WHAT WE LISTEN TO
IN MY CAR.

39:41.060 --> 39:41.958
- LIKE, CAN'T WE HAVE A LITTLE,
LIKE, YOU KNOW,

39:42.100 --> 39:42.953
SOMETHING SNAPPIER?

39:43.100 --> 39:44.408
- GET DRESSED, OKAY?
WE'RE LATE.

39:44.550 --> 39:45.369
- OKAY, I'M HURRYING.
I'M HURRYING.

39:45.520 --> 39:46.589
- GOD.
- YOU'RE THE BEST!

39:50.690 --> 39:53.170
- I GAVE YOU THE PEDIATRICIAN'S
NUMBER, RIGHT?

39:53.320 --> 39:54.275
- YES, YOU DID.

39:54.420 --> 39:58.004
- [sighs]

39:58.150 --> 40:00.243
- OKAY, BUDDY.

40:00.390 --> 40:02.665
WE'RE GONNA TALK EVERY DAY,
TWICE A DAY, OKAY?

40:02.810 --> 40:04.357
- WHY CAN'T I COME?

40:04.500 --> 40:06.229
- YOU CAN'T COME, HONEY.

40:06.360 --> 40:09.227
YOU HAVE TO STAY WITH YOUR
GRANDMA AND YOUR DAD.

40:09.370 --> 40:10.678
ALL RIGHT, GIVE ME A HUG.

40:15.170 --> 40:16.023
I LOVE YOU.

40:16.170 --> 40:17.398
- I LOVE YOU TOO.

40:17.550 --> 40:19.438
- LAST CALL.

40:19.580 --> 40:21.650

40:25.490 --> 40:26.798
I GOTTA GO.

40:28.320 --> 40:29.548
- ON MY WAY BACK HOME

40:29.700 --> 40:31.486
- IT'S OKAY.
WE'LL BE FINE.

40:31.630 --> 40:32.551
YOU'LL SHINE.

40:32.700 --> 40:35.635
- A CHANCE I THOUGHT OF

40:35.770 --> 40:37.146
- HAVE FUN.

40:37.290 --> 40:40.259
- MY FAVORITE SONG

40:40.400 --> 40:44.916
WHERE I'D GONE WRONG

40:45.060 --> 40:50.339
THE ONLY WORDS
THAT I COULD THINK OF

40:50.480 --> 40:52.300
- YOU WANNA GO GET SOME WAFFLES
ON THE WAY HOME,

40:52.450 --> 40:55.089
OR YOU WANNA WAIT
TILL WE GET HOME?

40:55.240 --> 40:57.856
- BOTH.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.628
- ON MY WAY BACK HOME

41:07.390 --> 41:08.550
EVERY STEP

41:08.700 --> 41:10.736
- HELLO! I'M HOME!

41:10.880 --> 41:14.566
- A VICTORY IT WAS

41:14.710 --> 41:18.567
I WAS CHEATING DEATH

41:18.710 --> 41:23.226
JUST IN TIME, I WOKE

41:23.370 --> 41:30.446
MY MEMORIES START
TO WANDER OFF

41:30.590 --> 41:31.989
COME TO ME

41:32.140 --> 41:36.895
[man announcing
baseball game]

41:37.040 --> 41:39.452
- ON MY WAY BACK HOME

41:39.600 --> 41:41.044
- AHH.

41:41.180 --> 41:43.182
- AND HE TAKES A FAST BALL
UP AND AWAY OUTSIDE

41:43.320 --> 41:44.526
FOR BALL NUMBER ONE.

41:44.670 --> 41:46.217

41:46.360 --> 41:48.089
- AND MAX'S SOLO.

41:48.220 --> 41:51.292

41:51.430 --> 41:52.772
- [trilling]

41:52.920 --> 41:54.126
- OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

41:54.270 --> 41:55.988
YOUR MOM SAID YOU DO
A GREAT RUSSIAN ACCENT.

41:56.130 --> 41:57.677
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
[Russian accent] YES, I CAN.

41:57.820 --> 41:58.809
- HOW COME YOU DON'T HAVE
TO EAT YOUR STRING BEANS?

41:58.960 --> 42:00.234
- 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO.

42:00.370 --> 42:01.689
- WHY DOESN'T HE HAVE
TO EAT HIS STRING BEANS?

42:01.820 --> 42:03.469
- WELL, BECAUSE
NOEL'S OUR GUEST.

42:03.620 --> 42:05.759
- LUCKILY I

42:05.900 --> 42:07.686
- HI.

42:07.830 --> 42:09.172

DAD WASN'T COMING.
