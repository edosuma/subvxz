WEBVTT

00:07.360 --> 00:09.408
- That was awesome.
- We just fed our hogs

00:09.480 --> 00:11.289
to those EndFrame motherfuckers.

00:11.360 --> 00:12.441
I don't know.

00:12.520 --> 00:13.760
Oh, shit.

00:17.200 --> 00:18.611
Richard.

00:19.400 --> 00:21.926
- I just got a call from Marc at EndFrame.
- Yeah.

00:22.040 --> 00:25.123
Uh, sorry that that deal
didn't go through, Russ,

00:25.200 --> 00:29.683
but this bake-off can be huge for us.

00:29.840 --> 00:32.411
And we should actually get started.
We have a lot of work to do.

00:32.479 --> 00:33.766
Yeah.

00:34.080 --> 00:35.730
We have a lot of work to do, Richard.

00:36.400 --> 00:37.447
A lot.

00:39.120 --> 00:41.168
We have to drink
this entire bottle of tequila today.

00:42.720 --> 00:44.722
- What?
- Bake-off, bitch.

00:44.800 --> 00:47.007
Let's get fucked up. Shots, baby.

00:47.080 --> 00:51.210
- Uh... I don't... I don't...
- Richard, this is my own brand.

00:51.720 --> 00:53.484
Tres Comas.

00:53.560 --> 00:54.721
Do you know what that means in Spanish?

00:54.800 --> 00:57.963
- Three...
- Nope. Three commas.

00:58.160 --> 00:59.321
As in, the number I'll have

00:59.480 --> 01:01.721
when we are done
kicking the tar out of EndFrame

01:01.800 --> 01:03.723
and I make that fuck
pile of Intersite money.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.131
Am I right? Come on, shots.

01:05.239 --> 01:08.608
- So, you're not mad?
- No, of course not.

01:10.120 --> 01:13.522
Okay. Yeah, sure. I'll just do one shot.

01:13.600 --> 01:16.809
We are going to drink to re-billionizing.

01:17.680 --> 01:18.727
Okay.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.086
To re-billionizing.

01:20.160 --> 01:21.491
- To re-billionizing.
- That's it.

01:27.800 --> 01:29.165
One more?

01:29.840 --> 01:30.841
Uh...

01:31.440 --> 01:32.680
Russ...

01:34.320 --> 01:39.565
We need to pay our lawyers
and we need to pay our engineers,

01:39.640 --> 01:43.440
so before you go, can you just
write us another check, please?

01:43.520 --> 01:45.682
What? No, Richard,
giving you money right now

01:45.760 --> 01:47.489
is the worst thing I could do for you.

01:48.520 --> 01:49.567
What? Why? HOW?

01:49.640 --> 01:50.641
Look what just happened.

01:50.720 --> 01:53.405
I threatened to walk
and you turned lean and hungry,

01:53.480 --> 01:56.484
and you clawed your way
into a $15-million deal.

01:56.600 --> 01:59.490
And when you win this bake-off,
because I gave you no money,

01:59.560 --> 02:02.609
and I get my third comma back,

02:04.040 --> 02:05.769
I promise you this, Richard,

02:05.840 --> 02:07.808
I'm gonna come back here
and you and I are gonna polish off

02:07.880 --> 02:10.406
this entire motherfucking bottle
of Tres Comas together.

02:10.639 --> 02:11.846
Put it right up high.

02:13.120 --> 02:15.122
Come on! Don't leave me hanging.

02:16.480 --> 02:18.084
That's it! That's how we do business.

02:30.160 --> 02:32.686
The Nucleus ad buy will be
the largest in our history.

02:33.040 --> 02:36.408
Awareness of this product
will be unprecedented.

02:36.680 --> 02:39.729
Yeah. Am I the only one
concerned about overexposure?

02:40.320 --> 02:43.164
Well, we haven't seen the platform yet,

02:43.240 --> 02:48.121
but we're planning on slipping Nucleus to
influential tech journalists and bloggers.

02:48.480 --> 02:50.608
Because, certainly, once
they see Nucleus...

02:50.680 --> 02:55.129
Sorry, sorry. That strategy
just sounds so inside the box.

02:55.200 --> 03:00.081
Might it not be more innovative
to shroud Nucleus in mystery

03:00.200 --> 03:02.407
until the official rollout next January?

03:03.280 --> 03:07.569
Gavin, I'm sorry.
Is everything okay with Nucleus?

03:08.760 --> 03:10.364
We are on schedule, yes?

03:10.600 --> 03:12.682
Because based on your assurances,

03:12.760 --> 03:15.650
we've staked substantial resources
on its performance.

03:17.840 --> 03:21.811
Gentlemen of the board, and Rachel,
listen to me very carefully.

03:22.240 --> 03:24.527
Nucleus is on track.

03:24.640 --> 03:28.361
And you have my word that if it fails
to be everything we need it to be,

03:28.440 --> 03:30.488
someone will be held responsible.

03:31.840 --> 03:34.844
Me? You want me to come back to Hooli?

03:35.800 --> 03:39.327
No way. It's too late.
I've accepted MIT's offer of tenure.

03:39.400 --> 03:42.643
My wife, my children and my mother
are already back in Boston.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.283
I'm here because I believe in you.

03:45.360 --> 03:48.728
And because I believe
we didn't believe in you enough before.

03:48.800 --> 03:49.926
Yeah, you did not.

03:50.320 --> 03:54.006
XYZ was beneath your talent.
Surely you felt it. I did.

03:54.080 --> 03:56.447
Why else would I lay it off on Bighetti?

03:57.320 --> 03:59.766
XYZ is about the distant future.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.081
But we can't wait for you.

04:01.160 --> 04:05.131
We need you now, guiding
critical components of our core business.

04:05.720 --> 04:08.326
Components like Nucleus.

04:10.040 --> 04:14.329
I'm sorry. Are you offering
to put me in full charge of Nucleus?

04:14.680 --> 04:17.843
Indeed I am. You and only you.

04:18.160 --> 04:20.640
You'll get the credit and the glory.

04:20.720 --> 04:25.681
The name Davis Bannerchek will be
inextricably linked with that of Nucleus.

04:27.320 --> 04:30.722
I mean, there's a chance no one will know
I had anything to do with it at all.

04:33.560 --> 04:36.484
Gentlemen, nothing else in the truck. Stop.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.645
Who's done with
the transcoding workflow? Me.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.971
Good job, Carla.
Or should I say, "Scrumptious"?

04:49.520 --> 04:51.648
Because of the board, the scrum board.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.331
- Oh, I get it.
- Yeah.

04:54.200 --> 04:58.364
Or just... I mean, not you.
I mean, you could... You are. Uh...

04:58.440 --> 05:03.685
Also, thanks to everybody
for forgoing your salary this week.

05:04.080 --> 05:08.449
Remember, if we win,
bonuses all around, so...

05:09.360 --> 05:10.486
Go team.

05:11.240 --> 05:12.571
When we win.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.765
That is rousing, Richard.

05:16.080 --> 05:18.128
Yeah, so, when we win it.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.889
Whoa. Have you guys seen this?

05:25.280 --> 05:27.567
Seth, the network security guy
from EndFrame,

05:27.680 --> 05:30.365
just changed his LinkedIn status
to "unemployed."

05:30.440 --> 05:33.046
No way. You think we got him fired?

05:33.600 --> 05:36.080
I bet we did. That's awesome.

05:36.440 --> 05:39.410
Well, we never actually
breached his security.

05:39.560 --> 05:42.689
Remember we got Marc's login info
and went through the front door?

05:42.760 --> 05:44.330
So, he didn't actually do anything wrong.

05:44.920 --> 05:48.606
He worked for EndFrame, the pieces
of shit that stole our algorithm.

05:48.680 --> 05:52.605
Yeah. So, by the transitive property,
he is, therefore, also a piece of shit.

05:53.480 --> 05:56.324
Well, the pieces of shit fired him.

05:56.960 --> 05:59.122
So, his "piece of shit" status is reversed.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.204
Okay, fine. So, the transitive property
may no longer apply,

06:02.280 --> 06:04.931
but the reflexive property
states everything is equal to itself.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.129
So, since he's a piece of shit,
he's a piece of shit.

06:08.320 --> 06:10.368
Okay, math aside,

06:10.440 --> 06:14.729
the point I'm trying to make here is
we didn't actually break his code. Okay?

06:14.800 --> 06:16.882
So, he's getting fired for no reason.

06:17.280 --> 06:18.645
And I kind of feel bad for the guy.

06:18.840 --> 06:22.640
He's probably pulling his hair out
somewhere, wondering where he screwed up.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.087
But he didn't screw up,

06:24.160 --> 06:26.208
and he'll never know that
for the rest of his life.

06:26.320 --> 06:27.481
I bet you're right.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.046
He probably is just
ripping his hair out somewhere.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.724
I wish I could see that.

06:33.640 --> 06:34.721
Piece of shit.

06:35.320 --> 06:36.606
He's a piece of shit.

06:53.720 --> 06:54.926
Monica?

06:56.680 --> 06:58.364
Did you forget about
Jian Yang and I's pitch?

06:58.480 --> 07:00.084
No, I was on my phone.

07:00.160 --> 07:02.686
You talking to Benson or Hedges?
Am I right?

07:02.920 --> 07:04.763
- Cigarette company.
- Clever.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.925
What if I told you
there is an app on the market...

07:09.000 --> 07:11.844
Not now. No, no, you wait
until you're inside. Okay?

07:12.680 --> 07:14.444
We haven't even gotten
the bottle of water yet.

07:14.640 --> 07:19.089
Head in. I'll meet you in there.
I just need to finish this call.

07:19.720 --> 07:21.404
Sure. Cool with a

07:23.360 --> 07:24.566
Okay.

07:25.080 --> 07:26.206
Water.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.840
What if I told you
there is an app...

07:30.920 --> 07:34.402
Jian Yang, this is the assistant.
We wait for the boss to pitch.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.209
The woman you saw outside. Okay?

07:36.280 --> 07:38.521
Oh, the lady who was smoking? You said no.

07:38.600 --> 07:41.888
Sorry. Monica was smoking? Cigarettes?

07:41.960 --> 07:43.086
Cigarettes.

07:43.160 --> 07:45.766
No, no, no. He's confused. He's Chinese.

07:45.960 --> 07:49.851
He's talking about this crack-addict
prostitute we saw at the gas station.

07:50.120 --> 07:52.885
She was smoking cigarettes. So sad.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.241
Oh.

07:57.880 --> 08:00.611
Jian Yang, what're you doing?
This is Palo Alto.

08:00.680 --> 08:02.728
People are lunatics about smoking here.

08:02.800 --> 08:06.725
We don't enjoy all the freedoms
that you have in China. All right?

08:06.840 --> 08:08.205
Where people smoke all the time.

08:08.280 --> 08:11.727
I don't smoke. Except
for special occasions.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.484
So, you do smoke?

08:13.560 --> 08:14.971
Wait, have you been smoking in my house?

08:15.240 --> 08:19.450
No. There's no special occasion
ever happen in your house.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.088
See this little bald spot on my temple?

08:26.120 --> 08:28.168
I've literally been
tearing my own hair out.

08:29.240 --> 08:31.846
I e-mailed Gilfoyle about a dozen times,

08:31.920 --> 08:34.241
and all he kept sending me
were these photos.

08:36.520 --> 08:38.522
Some woman choking. Balls.

08:38.600 --> 08:43.447
Choking. A pair of balls. I get it.
"Choke on my balls." It's like a rebus.

08:44.200 --> 08:45.486
He's such a dick.

08:46.240 --> 08:49.608
How the fuck did he get into my system?
At least give me a hint.

08:51.600 --> 08:52.965
Something. Anything.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.121
Fuck.

08:58.200 --> 09:00.806
What if, hypothetically,

09:02.800 --> 09:09.081
there was a certain CEO in your office that
left his login information on a Post-it,

09:09.840 --> 09:14.289
and a certain someone took it
and used that to get in?

09:15.320 --> 09:18.961
Are you saying Gilfoyle
never penetrated my network?

09:19.840 --> 09:22.844
I'm saying you weren't fired

09:22.920 --> 09:26.083
because of anything to do
with your security config.

09:26.560 --> 09:27.846
It wasn't my fault?

09:28.440 --> 09:30.204
- Oh, my God.
- You know what?

09:31.320 --> 09:32.287
I'm glad I came here.

09:32.360 --> 09:34.362
I think it's good
just to get everything out in the open...

09:34.480 --> 09:36.403
That piece of shit!

09:36.480 --> 09:38.642
Gilfoyle kept taunting me and taunting me.

09:38.720 --> 09:41.291
- What're you doing? No, don't call him.
- Hello, Gilfoyle?

09:41.360 --> 09:43.010
- It's Seth.
- Don't mention me or...

09:43.080 --> 09:45.890
Richard just told me about the Post-it,
so fuck you!

09:46.160 --> 09:48.322
You just fucked with the wrong hacker.

09:48.440 --> 09:49.521
There's... There's kids.

09:49.720 --> 09:52.803
I'm gonna skullfuck your whole system.
Fuck you, Gilfoyle!

09:53.680 --> 09:57.446
Fuck you, Richard!
Fuck all of you Pied Piper fucks!

09:58.680 --> 10:03.129
I actually, don't... I don't know him.
I'm just here by myself.

10:04.360 --> 10:05.930
Just watching and waiting.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.489
I love kids. Not like that.

10:09.480 --> 10:10.720
So...

10:12.280 --> 10:14.203
Why would you do that?
Why would you go talk to him?

10:14.360 --> 10:17.204
I don't know, you know.
Face-to-face meetings make things better.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.806
I just felt bad for the guy,
and he was not doing well.

10:19.960 --> 10:24.045
I mean, what if I hadn't said anything
and he'd have, you know, killed himself?

10:24.200 --> 10:26.248
Yeah, well, there's no chance
of that now, is there?

10:26.320 --> 10:29.051
Richard, you don't seem to understand
what's going on.

10:29.120 --> 10:32.567
We hacked into EndFrame's system
and stole their specs.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.406
You can't go traipsing around
to their former employees

10:35.480 --> 10:38.404
telling them how we did it
just to make them feel better.

10:38.480 --> 10:40.528
You're a fucking black hat now.
Act like it.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.921
- What? I'm a black hat? How am I a black hat?
- Shh!

10:43.000 --> 10:44.161
EndFrame stole from us first.

10:44.240 --> 10:47.801
And since the negative of a negative is a
positive, stealing from a thief is okay.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.325
It's the additive inverse property.

10:49.400 --> 10:52.006
Math aside, Richard, we're
all black hats now.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.924
The point is,
what are we gonna do about Seth?

10:55.000 --> 10:56.001
How do you mean?

10:56.080 --> 11:00.210
Well, I mean, we have an unemployed
and very pissed off systems guy

11:00.280 --> 11:04.410
who very publicly threatened
to skullfuck our whole system.

11:04.600 --> 11:07.524
He's not gonna do shit. He's a coder.

11:07.840 --> 11:09.410
By definition, we're all pussies.

11:09.800 --> 11:15.204
Look, he'll vent for half an hour
and then he'll go LARPing and mogging

11:15.320 --> 11:17.288
and stroke his dick for a while.

11:17.360 --> 11:21.843
Even if he does try to crack us, Richard,
I built our network security myself.

11:21.920 --> 11:23.922
- I'm not worried about it at all.
- So, just...

11:24.760 --> 11:26.285
This doesn't concern you guys?

11:26.400 --> 11:30.246
Okay, because he said, and I quote,
that he was going to skullfuck us!

11:31.520 --> 11:33.443
On. Hey. Hi.

11:33.920 --> 11:36.321
- You have a great daughter.
- Come on, Ashley, let's go.

11:42.880 --> 11:43.881
Go for Erlich.

11:43.960 --> 11:45.007
Thanks for outing me.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.851
You're gay. That explains so much.

11:48.160 --> 11:50.288
No, outing me for smoking.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.447
I was heading home when my insane boss
called me into the conference room

11:54.640 --> 11:57.803
for some kind of anti-smoking intervention.

11:58.680 --> 12:02.321
"No one ever died from secondhand heroin."
Yeah, she said that.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.482
- What did you say?
- I said nothing.

12:04.560 --> 12:08.804
Jian Yang may have let a little
something slip to your boy Friday,

12:08.880 --> 12:10.484
but don't worry, I covered with aplomb.

12:10.880 --> 12:13.281
That little weasel tells Laurie everything.

12:13.360 --> 12:15.567
On that topic, what did
you think of his app?

12:15.640 --> 12:18.211
Well, the fundamental idea is sound.

12:18.280 --> 12:20.931
An app that helps parents
find the least crowded playgrounds.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.206
Good. So, you understood him.

12:22.280 --> 12:27.286
The problem is, he's basically created the
perfect tool for pedophiles to find victims.

12:27.640 --> 12:30.849
Yes, and pedophiles
are typically not early-adopters,

12:31.080 --> 12:33.526
so we would miss out on that whole market.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.285
That's problematic.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.209
Well, we'll tweak it
when we present it to your boss.

12:37.560 --> 12:40.131
I don't think what I saw
was close to ready for Laurie.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.371
Oh, really, Monica?

12:42.440 --> 12:45.569
Well, I'm sorry that your boss
unearthed your filthy little secret,

12:45.640 --> 12:47.927
but believe it or not,
I actually tried to have your back,

12:48.000 --> 12:50.207
and I was hoping
you might do the same for me.

12:50.720 --> 12:55.681
Then again, your judgment is suspect.
You are a smoker.

12:56.480 --> 12:59.051
I smoke a few cigarettes a week.

13:02.400 --> 13:05.449
Fine. I'll ask Laurie for five minutes,
but that's it.

13:05.920 --> 13:07.445
And tell Jian Yang he better bring it.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.085
Monica, we may never know

13:09.200 --> 13:13.125
what indecipherable Chinese province
Jian Yang comes from,

13:13.280 --> 13:15.044
but I know this much,

13:15.160 --> 13:19.051
Jian Yang was born to bring it,
and you have got to try women.

13:19.720 --> 13:21.131
I mean, just give it a...

13:22.760 --> 13:25.604
I'm sure the work that you have done so far
has been very good.

13:25.680 --> 13:29.651
But now that I am here,
the real work begins,

13:29.720 --> 13:31.927
and time is of the essence.

13:32.040 --> 13:34.850
I'm gonna need status reports
from every department.

13:37.520 --> 13:38.567
Where are we?

13:39.920 --> 13:42.685
We have a mobile beta on a HooliPhone.

13:43.320 --> 13:44.446
You wanna see it?

13:44.880 --> 13:46.291
Hmm, yeah.

13:50.920 --> 13:53.241
He quit? What do you mean he quit?

13:53.360 --> 13:56.170
According to security,
he entered the building at 9:13.

13:56.240 --> 14:00.609
He met with the Nucleus team for 11 minutes.
Then he used his key card to exit the building.

14:00.680 --> 14:05.163
Three minutes later, he was clocked at 73
in a 25 zone going past our daycare center.

14:05.600 --> 14:08.729
He never returned, and he hasn't responded
to our calls or e-mail.

14:09.280 --> 14:11.886
Gavin, is it possible that
this is a good thing?

14:12.320 --> 14:13.685
Bannerchek was gonna step in
at the last minute

14:13.760 --> 14:15.728
and take a lot of the credit for Nucleus.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.280
Now the world will know
that you're responsible for Nucleus.

14:18.760 --> 14:19.966
You and you alone.

14:27.360 --> 14:28.441
Not now!

14:30.680 --> 14:35.208
Okay, so, no attempts
to externally access the system? Right?

14:35.280 --> 14:38.807
No SQLi, XSS, worms, Trojans, nothing?

14:39.520 --> 14:43.081
Same answer as I gave you
the last three days. No.

14:43.160 --> 14:45.925
Seth hasn't done shit. We're all good.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.243
Richard, your paranoia
has become officially tedious.

14:49.320 --> 14:52.449
Okay, okay. Our platform
is basically built.

14:52.520 --> 14:56.525
Tomorrow, Intersite is gonna start dumping
100 terabytes of video

14:56.640 --> 14:59.883
directly onto our server via fucking FTP.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.731
We are gonna be the most vulnerable
we've ever been.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.529
And Seth is out there lurking.

15:04.600 --> 15:10.084
Just lurking in the darknet ready to pounce,
like an Internet panther, and we don't care.

15:10.160 --> 15:13.960
Okay, well, frankly,
your lack of paranoia is insane to me.

15:14.840 --> 15:17.411
Now you're paranoid
that we're not paranoid enough?

15:17.880 --> 15:19.803
You're para-paranoid, Richard.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.251
- Where are you going?
- To the kitchen.

15:24.360 --> 15:25.441
Why are you going together?

15:25.520 --> 15:26.726
Are you gonna talk about me?

15:29.640 --> 15:32.450
What're you looking at?
You guys have got a lot of work to do.

15:50.880 --> 15:51.927
I'm glad you reached out.

15:52.480 --> 15:57.407
And I want you to know I'm not gonna do any
of those things that I threatened to do.

15:57.840 --> 16:02.482
Really? Just to be clear,
no skullfucking of any kind?

16:02.560 --> 16:05.404
No. I guess I just needed to vent.

16:06.640 --> 16:10.201
Actually, I was pretty worried
that you were gonna do something crazy.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.206
You can relax.

16:12.960 --> 16:17.488
And please tell Gilfoyle
I'm sorry for what I said,

16:17.560 --> 16:18.971
and that he can relax, too.

16:19.280 --> 16:20.327
Uh...

16:20.400 --> 16:23.563
You don't have to worry about Gilfoyle.
He couldn't have cared less.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.925
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:26.000 --> 16:31.166
You know, I gotta be honest.
I mean, I'm really glad I came back here.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.369
I mean, Dinesh and Gilfoyle
obviously said it was a bad idea,

16:34.440 --> 16:35.965
especially given what happened.

16:36.040 --> 16:39.840
But this just really restores my faith that
face-to-face meetings are the way to...

16:39.920 --> 16:42.161
That smug cocksucker
didn't think I had the skills

16:42.240 --> 16:44.163
to break into his system,
that motherfucker.

16:44.240 --> 16:45.844
What? What are you... Don't...
Who are you calling?

16:45.920 --> 16:48.651
- Hello, Gilfoyle. It's Seth again.
- Hey, don't mention that I...

16:48.720 --> 16:50.927
Richard here just told me
you're not afraid of me.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.731
Well, you know what
I'm gonna do to you now, motherfucker?

16:53.800 --> 16:55.325
Get out our here. Scatter. Scatter.

16:55.400 --> 16:57.607
I'm skullfucking the shit out
of your system this time.

16:57.680 --> 17:01.207
How you like me now, you cocksucking,
motherfucking piece of shit?

17:02.280 --> 17:03.850
In our initial build,

17:03.960 --> 17:06.930
we realized that the same
Geo-tagging technology

17:07.000 --> 17:10.607
that could be used to locate
uncrowded playgrounds

17:10.680 --> 17:14.810
could also be used to prey on children,
our greatest natural resource,

17:14.880 --> 17:18.281
by one of
society's worst elements, pedophiles.

17:18.800 --> 17:22.724
The pedophile facing nature of the app
would present marketing pain points. Yes.

17:22.800 --> 17:25.007
But under Monica's guidance,

17:25.079 --> 17:28.527
we realized the same technology
could also be used

17:28.600 --> 17:35.085
to create a real-time, crowd-sourced map
of an even worse segment of the population.

17:35.400 --> 17:37.846
- Worse than pedophiles?
- Smokers.

17:38.200 --> 17:39.406
Oh.

17:39.480 --> 17:43.530
Because, let's face it,
no one's ever died of secondhand heroin.

17:43.800 --> 17:44.926
True.

17:45.720 --> 17:46.767
True.

17:46.840 --> 17:50.367
With our app, users can
locate and thus avoid

17:50.440 --> 17:55.571
these self-indulgent,
self-destructive, negligent monsters.

17:55.720 --> 17:57.085
- Negligent?
- Yeah.

17:57.880 --> 17:59.803
We call it "Smokation."

18:00.360 --> 18:04.046
It's a clever hybrid
of "smoker" and "location."

18:05.840 --> 18:07.330
It's interesting.

18:08.280 --> 18:09.805
It's interesting.

18:11.920 --> 18:14.810
Well done. Well done.

18:14.880 --> 18:17.690
So, what kind of term sheet
do you think she's gonna lay on us?

18:17.760 --> 18:19.888
There's a lot of work to do,

18:19.960 --> 18:23.123
but you certainly knew
how to play to your audience.

18:23.240 --> 18:25.686
So, I'd say it looks good.

18:26.120 --> 18:27.281
Oh!

18:27.360 --> 18:29.010
Today is a great day.

18:29.080 --> 18:30.525
What is he doing?

18:33.480 --> 18:34.720
Special occasion.

18:35.880 --> 18:36.927
- Oh, shit.
- You...

18:37.000 --> 18:39.446
You brought cigarettes in here?

18:39.520 --> 18:41.204
No, I take from her purse.

18:44.080 --> 18:45.969
Well, this is it.

18:46.040 --> 18:49.886
Our pants are basically around our ankles
until this transfer is done. Anything?

18:50.720 --> 18:53.200
Again, no. Nothing.

18:53.880 --> 18:55.723
Okay. Well, did you sweep for...

18:55.800 --> 18:57.325
Unauthorized kernel modules, yes.

18:57.400 --> 19:00.563
I even purged
the entire server hypervisor again.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.962
I know we are vulnerable, right
now, but, Richard, we're covered, okay?

19:04.080 --> 19:05.491
We severed the prod and Dev net.

19:05.560 --> 19:07.688
Look, you made us put our phones
in a fucking Faraday cage.

19:07.760 --> 19:12.402
We even killed the Wi-Fi and reverted back
to this Stone Age hard line Ethernet switch.

19:12.680 --> 19:14.682
Look at all this shit. Are we in the '90s?

19:15.400 --> 19:19.166
Richard, no one is cracking our transfer.

19:19.240 --> 19:24.610
Not Seth, not some rogue nuclear state,
not Sk3wl of fucking ROOt.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.731
No one.

19:27.240 --> 19:31.211
And in two hours and 47 minutes,
when we've pulled all of Intersite's data

19:31.280 --> 19:35.285
onto our servers, we're golden,
so just chill the fuck out.

19:36.240 --> 19:38.561
Do another Weissman test
to make yourself feel better.

19:38.640 --> 19:39.721
I just did.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.441
Still at 5.1?

19:41.720 --> 19:43.563
Uh... Actually, 5.2.

19:44.120 --> 19:46.771
- Holy shit, dude. That's blazing.
- Hmm.

19:47.280 --> 19:49.123
Wait, so, we're actually
gonna win this thing.

19:49.400 --> 19:52.085
I don't know.
Ask me again in two hours and 46 minutes.

19:53.280 --> 19:55.442
Hey, quit all the
fucking and let me in.

19:56.120 --> 19:57.565
- Hey, come on, why's the door locked?
- Coming.

19:57.640 --> 19:59.369
- Are you afraid you're gonna get raped?
- Jared, don't...

20:00.120 --> 20:03.408
What? You're locking the door now?
You don't answer my texts. What the fuck?

20:03.480 --> 20:06.848
Russ, we're at a pretty critical juncture
right now, so...

20:06.920 --> 20:08.160
What's that?

20:08.240 --> 20:11.210
That is pornography,
thousands of hours of it.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.125
Yeah, it is.

20:13.320 --> 20:17.041
Russ, tomorrow, I would be happy
to walk this through with you.

20:17.120 --> 20:19.566
Okay. No, no, I'm out of here.
Just answer me this, are we good?

20:19.760 --> 20:22.286
Uh, yes. The platform is running great.

20:22.400 --> 20:25.051
But it's just really fragile right now
and we have a lot to focus on.

20:25.160 --> 20:26.730
So, again, probably tomorrow would be...

20:26.800 --> 20:28.882
Fine, fine, but after we have tequila.

20:30.080 --> 20:31.491
- What?
- Shots, boys.

20:31.560 --> 20:33.324
- I'm in.
- No, no one's in.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.084
What are... We're not
doing shots right now.

20:35.160 --> 20:38.926
Richard, come on, quit being such a pussy
and have some tequila with your money guy.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.081
You're not our money guy.

20:40.160 --> 20:41.321
I'm not your money guy. Since when?

20:41.400 --> 20:43.243
Since you stopped giving us money, asshole.

20:47.320 --> 20:49.641
Who's an asshole? I forced you to get lean.

20:49.720 --> 20:52.485
No. You forced us to hack EndFrame
and break the law.

20:52.560 --> 20:54.722
And now, like it or not,
I'm a fucking black hat.

20:54.800 --> 20:57.121
But that's okay. That's okay. That's cool.

20:57.200 --> 20:58.804
We're gonna win this bake-off

20:58.880 --> 21:01.281
and pay you enough money
to go away forever.

21:01.360 --> 21:02.486
So, take your shitty tequila

21:02.560 --> 21:04.722
and your shitty jeans
with fucking metal chunks on them,

21:04.800 --> 21:06.165
and get the fuck out of here.

21:11.920 --> 21:13.046
Wow. That's...

21:14.200 --> 21:15.326
That's harsh.

21:17.200 --> 21:20.488
First of all, this is not shitty tequila.
This is very good tequila.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.049
400-year-old family-run distillery.
Super high-end shit.

21:25.200 --> 21:29.171
But I guess what really bums me out
is I thought we got each other.

21:29.880 --> 21:31.882
You know, you were my guys, you know?

21:33.880 --> 21:35.041
That guy-

21:36.720 --> 21:38.085
Bin Laden.

21:40.360 --> 21:41.441
He fucks.

21:47.680 --> 21:50.251
You know what's hard
about being a billionaire, Richard?

21:51.240 --> 21:54.449
You never know if someone
likes you for you or for your money.

21:55.480 --> 22:00.088
And I guess, with you, it was all
about the money, wasn't it, Richard?

22:01.720 --> 22:05.247
Don't you worry, I'll leave, and I'll even
leave you the tequila because that's who I am.

22:05.840 --> 22:07.410
But before I go,

22:08.760 --> 22:11.240
I want you to come outside
and see something. It's a gift.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.407
Come on outside, everybody.
Just... I won't waste your time.

22:14.520 --> 22:15.760
Just for a second.

22:17.520 --> 22:18.521
No way.

22:18.600 --> 22:21.729
A McLaren 650$ Spider.

22:22.760 --> 22:26.048
Yup, just like the one I had to sell
when I dropped below a

22:26.880 --> 22:27.961
Billion.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.728
What do you think, Richard? You like it?

22:31.800 --> 22:33.211
Uh, wow! Uh...

22:33.280 --> 22:36.045
I don't know what to say.

22:37.840 --> 22:39.205
You got this for me?

22:40.280 --> 22:41.361
What?

22:41.960 --> 22:44.566
No, I... It's for me. I
bought this for myself.

22:45.640 --> 22:47.847
To celebrate you guys
helping me get back to a billion.

22:48.120 --> 22:51.966
That's why I came here, to show it to you.
To say thank you. I'm not an asshole.

22:52.640 --> 22:55.883
- You drove here with a bow on it?
- No, I put it on after I parked.

22:56.280 --> 22:57.327
I don't understand.

22:57.400 --> 23:00.483
You got yourself a gift
to prove that you're not an asshole?

23:00.640 --> 23:01.687
Right.

23:02.600 --> 23:04.807
Sorry. Hello.

23:04.880 --> 23:06.564
This is Eshwar Singh, the CTO of Intersite.

23:06.640 --> 23:09.120
What the fuck are you doing?
You're deleting all my data.

23:10.520 --> 23:12.807
What the hell? What the hell?

23:15.800 --> 23:17.802
- Fuck, I'm locked out of the system.
- So am I.

23:17.920 --> 23:19.763
- We all are.
- It's just deleting everything.

23:19.840 --> 23:21.205
You motherfuckers!

23:22.000 --> 23:25.209
It's fucking Seth.
Gilfoyle, you said you had this.

23:25.280 --> 23:28.045
I thought I did. I don't...
This is fucking impossible!

23:28.120 --> 23:30.487
You guys are killing me.
I'm losing hundreds of hours of content.

23:30.560 --> 23:34.451
Yeah, well, we got hacked. So, pull
the plug. Shut it down on your end.

23:34.520 --> 23:37.763
I can't. The disk is spinning at 100%
and I don't have access.

23:37.840 --> 23:40.650
Now it's basically a fucking fork bomb,
and you locked me out of my own system.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.051
Okay, Carla, shut it down.

23:42.560 --> 23:44.562
None of the system
shortcuts are responding.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.251
Can't even SIGKILL the transfer.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.761
It's like all of our keyboards are locked.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.924
Okay, fucking...
Eshwar, I can't really problem solve this

23:52.000 --> 23:53.570
and talk to you on the phone
at the same time, so...

23:53.640 --> 23:54.926
Don't you dare fucking hang up on...

23:55.000 --> 23:57.128
How the fuck did Seth do this?

23:57.200 --> 23:58.850
Well, you said he was harmless.

23:59.040 --> 24:01.850
Obviously I was wrong.
He must be inside as root.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.362
It's like he's right here in this house
melting us down.

24:04.520 --> 24:06.682
Can you guys just shut the fuck up?
I'm trying to sleep.

24:06.760 --> 24:10.048
Why the fuck would you smoke
immediately after an anti-smoking pitch?

24:10.120 --> 24:12.487
- Why would you do that? Why?
- It's a special occasion.

24:12.560 --> 24:13.607
Go to your room! Fuck!

24:13.720 --> 24:14.926
My keyboard
isn't hooked up to anything...

24:15.000 --> 24:16.923
Seth is single-handedly
fucking the future of this company

24:17.000 --> 24:18.240
and there's nothing we can do about it!

24:18.320 --> 24:21.210
Make it stop. Make it stop. Make it stop.

24:22.280 --> 24:23.611
It just stopped deleting.

24:28.360 --> 24:29.441
Hey, guys.

24:30.440 --> 24:32.442
I think it's this.

24:34.960 --> 24:36.325
- What the fuck?
- It's happening again.

24:36.960 --> 24:38.928
- No, no, no! Stop doing that!
- Take it off! Take it off!

24:39.000 --> 24:40.047
Huh.

24:43.800 --> 24:47.441
The Tres Comas bottle was on
the delete key. It was...

24:48.320 --> 24:49.401
The corner of it.

24:49.840 --> 24:52.810
It was just... it just got on there.

24:56.160 --> 24:58.242
That's not great, but...

25:00.040 --> 25:01.371
Good now. Here you go.

25:02.120 --> 25:03.281
I'm gonna...

25:05.480 --> 25:06.606
I gotta go.

25:13.280 --> 25:17.569
Did we delete over 9,000 hours
of your premium content?

25:18.520 --> 25:20.443
Yes, we did.

25:20.840 --> 25:22.604
And that is bad, certainly.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.643
But the way we did it.

25:26.920 --> 25:31.369
See, our compression
is so incredibly powerful

25:31.440 --> 25:35.411
that we were able to delete all those files

25:35.480 --> 25:39.087
at a rate that until now was unthinkable.

25:40.160 --> 25:43.369
If we're considering just raw speed.

25:45.280 --> 25:48.170
So, uh, just bear in mind,

25:48.240 --> 25:51.483
you know, when making your final decision,

25:51.560 --> 25:56.885
had EndFrame accidentally
put a tequila bottle on their delete key,

25:58.360 --> 26:04.163
I guarantee, they would have struggled to
delete half the amount of files that we did.

26:05.560 --> 26:06.607
At best.

26:08.560 --> 26:10.483
Or worst. I could also...

26:11.640 --> 26:13.483
I could... I...

26:13.800 --> 26:15.131
- Ended up being the worst.
- Worst.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.001
- Definitely.
- Yeah.

26:19.160 --> 26:21.686
But you know what? Um...

26:22.480 --> 26:23.845
I...

26:24.640 --> 26:29.328
I'm actually glad
that we came here today, all of us,

26:29.440 --> 26:30.771
because this is good.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.288
Because now more than ever, in these times,

26:37.080 --> 26:38.923
meeting face-to-face...

26:39.600 --> 26:40.965
Get out.

26:42.680 --> 26:45.047
- All of us or just...
- Now. All of you.

26:45.520 --> 26:46.851
Okay.

26:49.240 --> 26:50.571
Thank you for your time.

26:53.360 --> 26:56.523
I would be remiss if I didn't mention that

26:57.720 --> 27:01.008
your sites are some of my
primary destinations...

27:01.080 --> 27:02.445
- Out.
- Okay.
