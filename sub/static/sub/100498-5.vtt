WEBVTT

00:31.781 --> 00:33.867
Where is this place?

00:33.950 --> 00:34.951
Where am I?

00:36.077 --> 00:37.662
I don't speak English.

00:38.663 --> 00:40.040
Sit down, please.

00:41.124 --> 00:41.958
Phone?

00:43.001 --> 00:45.670
No, local calls only.

00:46.713 --> 00:49.924
Please, be careful.
You should not be moving around.

00:50.008 --> 00:51.468
The doctor will come soon.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.678
Who brought me here?

00:53.762 --> 00:55.305
Did Fring do this?

00:56.890 --> 00:59.809
Gustavo Fring.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.978
Sit down.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.147
I will get you a glass of water.

02:59.095 --> 03:01.431
Look what you've done to all my fine work.

03:03.933 --> 03:06.227
What am I doing here?

03:07.395 --> 03:09.439
You were meant to be recovering.

03:10.940 --> 03:12.442
What's he want with me?

03:13.443 --> 03:16.195
He's asked me to keep you alive.

03:17.947 --> 03:20.033
Will you allow this?

03:56.361 --> 03:58.321
FOREMAN:
Okay, listen up.

03:58.404 --> 04:02.158
If Acker doesn't leave on his own
by quarter after, the sheriff's gonna evict.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.370
Once that's done,
utilities will drop and cut their lines

04:05.453 --> 04:07.288
while we take down the north fence.

04:07.372 --> 04:10.667
Anything inside the place gets loaded up
and sent to storage.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.045
Debris goes in the side dumpster.

04:14.128 --> 04:17.215
Concrete's staying.
Disposal company's coming for it.

04:17.298 --> 04:20.718
-We good so far?
-I think I might be seeing a hitch here.

04:20.802 --> 04:22.470
Wait, who are you?

04:22.553 --> 04:25.807
I'm Saul Goodman, attorney-at-law.
Glad to meet you.

04:25.890 --> 04:30.311
-A better question might be, where are we?
-What's that supposed to mean?

04:30.395 --> 04:31.479
Well, you know what?

04:31.562 --> 04:34.232
It's coming up on the hour,
so a word to the wise,

04:34.315 --> 04:38.486
if you let everyone go right now,
you might save half a day's salary in fringes.

04:38.569 --> 04:40.655
What the hell are you talking about?

04:42.865 --> 04:45.868
Deputies, great. Perfect timing.

04:45.952 --> 04:49.080
-What's going on?
-He's a lawyer, says he has a hitch.

04:49.163 --> 04:52.750
I'm Everett Acker's attorney,
I'm just dotting the I's in "due diligence."

04:52.834 --> 04:55.920
Well, I'm sorry, sir.
The eviction order's signed by a judge.

04:56.004 --> 04:58.506
I'm sure it is. Can I have a peek at that?

04:59.924 --> 05:01.426
It's all correct, sir.

05:01.509 --> 05:02.760
Uh-huh.

05:02.844 --> 05:06.556
Sir, since you represent Mr. Acker, can you
make sure he cooperates with the eviction?

05:06.639 --> 05:09.183
Can you make out the address on that?

05:11.019 --> 05:14.314
1130 Arroyo Vista. Is there a problem?

05:14.397 --> 05:16.774
Well, I mean, is that where we are?

05:21.070 --> 05:25.158
There were house numbers on that mailbox,
plain as day. Eleven-thirty.

05:25.241 --> 05:26.659
I don't see any.

05:26.743 --> 05:27.910
Do you, deputy?

05:27.994 --> 05:29.245
No. I don't.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.999
Well, somebody messed with them.
This is 1130 Arroyo Vista.

05:33.082 --> 05:36.711
This here's 1240 Arroyo Vista.

05:36.794 --> 05:39.589
It's always been 1240 Arroyo Vista.

05:39.672 --> 05:42.300
-Twelve-forty?
-Twelve-forty.

05:42.383 --> 05:47.055
-My client says it's 1240.
-I got a plat map, says we can straighten this out.

05:47.138 --> 05:51.601
Well, all due respect to whoever drew that map,
but Mr. Acker's been living here for 30 years.

05:51.684 --> 05:56.189
-I think he knows his own address.
-Sir, you got something with an address on it?

06:10.244 --> 06:11.662
Thank you.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.920
1240 Arroyo Vista.

06:19.003 --> 06:23.091
It's 1130. Anybody can print out something
like that. You've got an order signed by a judge.

06:23.174 --> 06:26.803
You know, we could get a surveyor up here
this afternoon. He'll clear everything up.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.388
-That would lose us a full day.
-Listen, officer.

06:29.472 --> 06:33.226
Before you go forcing an elderly veteran
from his home and take everything he's got,

06:33.309 --> 06:38.064
demolish a half century of hard work,
wouldn't you like to know you got the right place?

06:41.484 --> 06:44.612
Come on, all we're talking about
are some missing house numbers.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.616
I have to make a call.

06:56.541 --> 06:59.043
Everybody take 10!

07:07.176 --> 07:11.931
KEVIN: After a year of running every which way,
now the guy gets a lawyer?

07:12.014 --> 07:14.433
The lawyer comes in, the crazy comes out.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.894
We had it straightened out in a matter of hours.

07:16.978 --> 07:19.689
It was a gimmick,
and not a particularly effective one.

07:19.772 --> 07:23.693
It's costing us a day.
I call that plenty effective.

07:25.319 --> 07:30.366
But we're past that. Tomorrow they're finally
tearing the place down, right?

07:30.450 --> 07:32.577
That's the plan.

07:33.911 --> 07:35.580
There's more?

07:35.663 --> 07:37.999
KIM:
Unfortunately, there is another complication.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.462
The lawyer Acker hired, it's Jimmy.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.382
Jimmy? Your Jimmy?

07:46.466 --> 07:47.925
-Yes.
-Pfft.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.303
How did that happen?

07:50.386 --> 07:52.722
Jimmy's been doing some
very aggressive marketing.

07:52.805 --> 07:55.850
Looks like Acker picked up on it.

07:57.768 --> 07:59.854
Okay, so, what now?

08:02.398 --> 08:07.236
In fairness to you, I'll withdraw from everything
having to do with the Tucumcari project.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.947
Stef will step in for me.
She and Paige can see it through.

08:10.031 --> 08:13.868
Kim's brought us this far.
I think Stef will do a fine job for us.

08:13.951 --> 08:16.204
Of course, this is just Tucumcari
we're talking about.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.956
I'll continue to handle everything else as usual.

08:21.792 --> 08:22.835
You know what?

08:23.836 --> 08:25.713
I smell a rat.

08:27.006 --> 08:30.009
Acker hiring Jimmy, that's no coincidence.

08:30.092 --> 08:33.137
And I heard about the talking-to
you gave that guy.

08:33.221 --> 08:35.014
Sounds like you tore him a new one.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.808
-I-- I wouldn't say that I--
-Here's what I think.

08:37.892 --> 08:40.394
This fella saw you for the killer you are,

08:40.478 --> 08:44.815
and he went and hired Jimmy specifically
to take you away from us.

08:47.485 --> 08:48.319
Kevin, I--

08:49.320 --> 08:52.031
I have to say, I think that's very unlikely.

08:52.114 --> 08:54.951
Trust me on this, Kim.
I know a scam when I see one, okay?

08:55.034 --> 08:57.995
No disrespect.
I'm sure your associate's more than capable.

08:58.079 --> 09:03.626
But I am not gonna let this guy
deprive me of the best in the business.

09:05.127 --> 09:07.547
I think what Kim's trying to say is that

09:07.630 --> 09:13.386
going home to the attorney on the other side
of this matter could get awkward for her.

09:14.720 --> 09:18.266
Is that right, Kim?
This gonna be tough on you at home?

09:19.267 --> 09:22.937
It's not the personal side that concerns me.

09:23.020 --> 09:26.482
I just wouldn't want there to be any question
of conflict of interest.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.359
Well, I'm not worried about that.

09:29.026 --> 09:32.822
If you're willing to stick with it,
I say, why change horses midstream?

09:33.823 --> 09:35.866
Kevin, are they waiting for you?

09:37.034 --> 09:38.619
Oh, yeah.

09:38.703 --> 09:43.749
Listen. I need that call center.
We gotta get this thing moving now.

09:43.833 --> 09:47.044
We got a lot of competitors out there,
and none of them

09:47.128 --> 09:51.966
are waiting on some crabby old son of a bitch
to get their damn call centers built.

09:53.175 --> 09:56.095
-Got it?
-Got it.

10:00.391 --> 10:02.184
I know you do.

10:09.525 --> 10:12.403
That an MRI machine I saw back there?

10:13.654 --> 10:14.530
It is.

10:16.032 --> 10:18.200
And Fring paid for all this.

10:19.201 --> 10:20.578
Huh.

10:20.661 --> 10:27.084
And all those nice little houses out there.
I'm guessing there are bales of meth inside.

10:28.419 --> 10:30.296
There are no drugs here.

10:30.379 --> 10:33.007
None, save the ones that I prescribe.

10:34.008 --> 10:37.011
No men with guns either.

10:39.555 --> 10:42.141
And if I wanna get back to where I belong?

10:43.267 --> 10:45.436
You're welcome to leave.

10:45.519 --> 10:47.980
You'd go back
to the road where I found you.

10:48.981 --> 10:53.444
Five kilometers from here,
there's a gate that leads to the main road.

10:53.527 --> 10:55.154
There are men at that gate.

10:56.155 --> 10:59.200
Those men have guns, I'm guessing.

10:59.283 --> 11:00.826
Perhaps.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.578
I've never seen any weapons.

11:03.996 --> 11:07.124
In any case, they will not stop you.

11:08.167 --> 11:12.129
Twelve kilometers up the highway,
there's a small town.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.757
Bigger than this place, but small.

11:15.883 --> 11:17.676
There is a bus stop.

11:18.177 --> 11:19.804
Once you're on that bus...

11:21.222 --> 11:24.725
you're perhaps a day from El Paso.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.397
However...

11:30.481 --> 11:34.693
as you are now,
you would not survive the journey.

11:37.238 --> 11:40.241
My advice is to rest.

11:41.575 --> 11:46.205
Enjoy some of Señora Cortazar's
excellent cooking.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.417
And take in some clean air.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.514
Fring carts me all the way down here.

12:05.141 --> 12:06.559
Why?

12:06.642 --> 12:08.519
That I do not know.

12:08.602 --> 12:10.479
You would have to ask him.

12:11.605 --> 12:14.442
So you're just his on-call quack?

12:14.525 --> 12:18.404
I am the quack who saved your life.

12:20.239 --> 12:22.992
This is for infection.

12:23.075 --> 12:27.121
Two every four hours for the next week.
This is for the pain.

12:27.204 --> 12:29.165
Take it when you need it.

12:29.248 --> 12:32.293
I'll be back to check on you in three days.

12:33.752 --> 12:39.633
Then, in a week or so,
perhaps you will be able to travel.

12:40.843 --> 12:44.430
I can get a message to your family.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.391
They're fine.

15:27.593 --> 15:28.761
Hello, Howard.

15:28.844 --> 15:31.388
Hi, Jimmy. This a bad time?

15:31.472 --> 15:36.352
Um, I'm a bit busy, to be honest, but...

15:37.353 --> 15:38.687
what's up?

15:38.771 --> 15:41.315
Just thinking about you. How are you doing?

15:42.441 --> 15:43.400
Fine.

15:43.484 --> 15:45.945
<i>Mm. Glad to hear it.</i>

15:47.071 --> 15:49.114
So, what's up?

15:50.115 --> 15:52.785
Just touching base,
to see if you had any thoughts

15:52.868 --> 15:54.870
on what we talked about.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.164
What we talked about...

15:57.247 --> 15:59.249
Oh, the job! Oh.

15:59.333 --> 16:03.504
Oh, yeah, no, I mean, hey,
I've been thinking of nothing else, really.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.048
Glad to hear it.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.549
Any conclusions?

16:07.633 --> 16:09.843
<i>Uh, no. I'm just-- I'm mulling it over.</i>

16:09.927 --> 16:13.806
You know, reflecting, trying to give it
the consideration that it deserves.

16:13.889 --> 16:18.352
<i>Fair enough.</i>
<i>I'm ready to discuss the details when you are.</i>

16:18.435 --> 16:20.938
-Sounds good.
<i>-And Jimmy...</i>

16:35.619 --> 16:37.162
Hey.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.749
Smells interesting.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.960
Oh, yeah, that's the curry.

16:43.043 --> 16:45.254
I think it's our unlikely hero.

16:45.337 --> 16:50.009
I'm gonna have to soak it overnight,
but it'll be ready first thing.

16:50.092 --> 16:53.887
-So how'd it go with Kevin?
-Well, I'm still on the case.

16:53.971 --> 16:56.765
No shit. That's great! What happened?

16:56.849 --> 16:57.975
Uh...

16:58.058 --> 17:01.854
You know, the more I wanted to go,
the more he wanted me to stay.

17:01.937 --> 17:05.315
JIMMY: Yeah, but he was pissed, right?
-A little bit.

17:05.399 --> 17:06.775
Right, so where were you?

17:06.859 --> 17:09.820
Uh, we were at his country club.

17:09.903 --> 17:11.196
Oh!

17:11.280 --> 17:14.616
Cutting it close to tee time.
Pressure. That's excellent.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.953
-He had to move his game, actually.
-Ha! I love it!

17:18.037 --> 17:19.038
Right. Now what?

17:19.121 --> 17:22.082
Uh, you were sitting?
You were standing? I mean...

17:22.166 --> 17:24.752
-Hmm?
-Paint a picture. Set the scene.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.837
Come on.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.840
Uh...

17:30.841 --> 17:33.010
Okay. Um...

17:33.093 --> 17:37.681
-Paige and I meet him outside the clubhouse.
-Mm-hm.

17:37.765 --> 17:44.730
And the three of us are at a table,
and he's over here like this, and he says--

17:44.813 --> 17:45.647
Wait.

17:46.857 --> 17:48.358
He sits like that?

17:48.442 --> 17:51.945
-Yeah, he sits to the side.
-He's a side sitter?

17:53.113 --> 17:53.947
I guess so.

17:54.031 --> 17:57.367
Okay, well, you never told me
that he was a side sitter.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.661
And that is gold.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.789
Now, go on.

18:01.872 --> 18:08.378
Okay, so he's sitting here, and he says, uh:

18:09.505 --> 18:12.091
-"I'm not gonna let him deprive--"
-Wait, do the voice.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.761
-I'm not gonna imitate him.
-Yes. Come on. Give me a nibble.

18:15.844 --> 18:17.346
I mean, he's a good old boy, right?

18:17.429 --> 18:19.848
So do he talk like this?

18:19.932 --> 18:22.267
-Uh, no. No.
-Ding, dang, doo?

18:22.351 --> 18:24.728
It's, uh...

18:24.812 --> 18:28.232
It's more like, um...

18:29.483 --> 18:34.113
Lawyer comes in, crazy comes out.

18:34.196 --> 18:37.157
I need that call center real bad.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.034
Of course, Kevin.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.745
- Wait, are you being me?
-Yes, this is you.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.247
Yes. Go on. Go on.

18:45.749 --> 18:50.963
Okay. I'm not gonna
let him deprive me. No, sirree.

18:51.046 --> 18:52.047
-Kim,
-Hmm?

18:52.131 --> 18:54.758
I need it sooner than yesterday, got it?

18:54.842 --> 18:58.470
-But, Kevin...
-No, you do whatever it takes.

18:58.554 --> 19:02.808
I don't like waiting one bit.
Never have, never will.

19:02.891 --> 19:06.854
Bottom line, breaking ground. More statues.

19:06.937 --> 19:09.940
Kim, you get him now. Blah, blah, blah.

19:10.023 --> 19:14.444
Blah, blah, blah.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.700
What?

19:21.368 --> 19:22.619
Kevin?

19:24.997 --> 19:26.665
Yes, Kim?

19:28.417 --> 19:31.587
Would you care to take a shower with me?

19:33.839 --> 19:35.007
Well, shoot.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.218
I believe I would.

19:59.698 --> 20:03.869
OPERATOR :
<i>The international call cannot be placed.</i>

21:09.184 --> 21:10.435
<i>Gracias.</i>

21:45.470 --> 21:48.598
GUS: <i>Hello.</i>
-You know who this is?

21:49.933 --> 21:52.686
<i>How are you feeling? Better, I trust?</i>

21:52.769 --> 21:54.313
Uh-huh.

21:55.314 --> 21:58.066
You don't do anything without a reason.

21:59.067 --> 22:00.319
Why am I here?

22:01.611 --> 22:03.572
<i>Now is not a good time.</i>

22:20.464 --> 22:22.382
What's going on here?

22:24.009 --> 22:27.095
Sir, sir, please watch your step.
Stop right there!

22:27.179 --> 22:29.222
-What the hell?
-Please stay out of the grid.

22:29.306 --> 22:30.348
The what?

22:30.432 --> 22:34.227
The area marked by the stakes.
Step out of it, please.

22:34.311 --> 22:35.854
So what about it, doctor?

22:35.937 --> 22:40.817
Well, at a glance, I'd say
these pieces are likely contemporary.

22:40.901 --> 22:42.819
I'll bet they are.

22:42.903 --> 22:45.947
But we need to do
a systematic property search to be sure.

22:46.031 --> 22:48.200
Really? Is that necessary?

22:48.283 --> 22:51.912
-I'm afraid so.
-Whoa, whoa, how long is this gonna take?

22:51.995 --> 22:55.707
-A day or two. A week at the most.
-A week?

22:55.791 --> 22:58.794
Come on.
You know this guy planted that stuff here.

22:58.877 --> 22:59.795
Whoa!

22:59.878 --> 23:02.339
This is the same thing
with the house numbers, all over!

23:02.422 --> 23:04.883
No, that was an honest mistake. This is the law!

23:04.966 --> 23:09.387
-Says who?
-Says the New Mexico Cultural Properties Act.

23:11.473 --> 23:12.474
No.

23:13.517 --> 23:16.436
You're not going along with this. Seriously?

23:19.689 --> 23:21.900
I have to make a call.

23:41.336 --> 23:42.879
VIOLA:
Sorry to interrupt.

23:42.963 --> 23:45.507
He's suing on behalf of the water district.

23:45.590 --> 23:47.592
The water district?

23:52.347 --> 23:54.599
Stef, you're good with regulatory law.

23:54.683 --> 23:59.646
He's claiming there's a flaw
in the original land grant from 1846.

23:59.729 --> 24:02.023
That's ridiculous.

24:05.986 --> 24:08.738
Pat, you better drop everything else.

24:09.739 --> 24:13.451
He's claiming our prime contractor
is an escaped felon.

24:13.535 --> 24:15.704
You can't be serious.

24:16.997 --> 24:19.249
Evan, I'm gonna give this one to you.

25:03.501 --> 25:06.838
SAUL: I can see the Little Dipper.
ACKER: That's the Big Dipper.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.590
-Oh.
-Yeah.

25:14.012 --> 25:18.308
Ah, right over here. Is that Orion over there?

25:18.391 --> 25:19.809
ACKER:
No. That's a satellite.

25:30.570 --> 25:33.448
MAN:
Officer, radiation's borderline.

25:33.531 --> 25:35.492
We gotta get soil samples.

25:39.788 --> 25:40.830
Do I have to ask?

25:40.914 --> 25:43.124
I'm gonna have to, uh...

25:44.125 --> 25:45.669
You know.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.171
Better safe than sorry.

25:49.506 --> 25:51.716
Yes. Got it.

25:53.051 --> 25:54.135
We have a problem.

25:59.599 --> 26:01.685
ACKER:
I've always enjoyed your radio program.

26:01.768 --> 26:06.731
And I never thought I'd see a miracle
with my very own eyes.

26:06.815 --> 26:08.817
That's right. Tucumcari.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.735
Right off 54.

26:10.819 --> 26:12.404
There's plenty of parking.

26:12.737 --> 26:15.282
Well, thank you!

26:15.365 --> 26:19.661
I'm a long-time listener
and a first-time caller.

26:23.331 --> 26:25.000
WOMAN:
Oh, I see it.

26:25.083 --> 26:26.835
ACKER:
Hello, there.

26:31.047 --> 26:31.881
Oh, wow.

26:40.140 --> 26:41.516
What's your name, honey?

26:59.159 --> 27:01.411
Goddamn it.

27:04.080 --> 27:06.124
The crowd's already thinning out.

27:06.207 --> 27:08.835
The image on the side of the house
has started to fade.

27:08.918 --> 27:12.547
Tomorrow, we're bringing in additional security
and blocking off parking.

27:14.049 --> 27:15.633
Answer me this.

27:15.717 --> 27:20.305
If they're saying it's radioactive over there,
how the hell is Acker still in that house?

27:20.388 --> 27:23.600
That was really more of an OSHA situation.

27:23.683 --> 27:25.685
The concern was for the construction crew.

27:25.769 --> 27:28.938
Turns out, the radiation level
was completely safe.

27:29.022 --> 27:31.941
We should be cleared
to resume construction on Thursday.

27:32.025 --> 27:34.527
Assuming nothing else comes up.

27:38.948 --> 27:42.410
Kim, ahem. Bottom-line me here.

27:43.578 --> 27:46.998
Clearly, this is all designed
to force us back to the table

27:47.082 --> 27:49.709
and put us at a disadvantage
when we get there.

27:49.793 --> 27:52.837
We gotta get back
in the driver's seat on this thing.

27:53.838 --> 27:57.217
I say we sue them right back.
Sue Acker, sue Goodman.

27:57.300 --> 27:59.719
Take the fight back to them.

27:59.803 --> 28:02.639
Going down that road could take years.

28:03.556 --> 28:07.102
They know this is costing Mesa Verde.
Time is on their side.

28:07.769 --> 28:09.687
You got that right.

28:12.273 --> 28:14.275
Rich, do you have anything to add?

28:15.276 --> 28:16.236
Possibly.

28:17.237 --> 28:20.990
What if there were a way
to turn this around on them?

28:22.283 --> 28:26.454
What if you don't build the call center?
Or not at that location, at least.

28:26.538 --> 28:29.999
Suddenly, you're holding all the cards,
there's nothing to delay.

28:30.083 --> 28:33.753
The other side's the one spending money
with no hope of recovering their expenses.

28:35.755 --> 28:37.048
Wait, so...

28:38.049 --> 28:39.134
What?

28:39.217 --> 28:42.470
RICH:
I understand there's a viable alternative site.

28:42.554 --> 28:46.141
You make the switch, and you've won.

28:47.350 --> 28:49.936
Wait, hold up. Didn't we let the other site go?

28:50.019 --> 28:54.023
Lot 2375 is available, and our permits still apply.

28:54.107 --> 28:57.527
We'd still hit our target
for getting the call center up and running.

28:58.528 --> 29:01.322
We took the liberty
of running the numbers for you.

29:02.949 --> 29:05.702
The financial hit would be negligible.

29:20.383 --> 29:25.263
-My dad did not raise me to run from a fight.
-Kevin, we're not saying--

29:25.346 --> 29:30.351
I'm not gonna roll over and let some
low-life shyster bully me off my land.

29:30.435 --> 29:31.936
No offense, Kim.

29:33.021 --> 29:37.108
He's got one lawyer.
I got a room full of the best there is.

29:38.526 --> 29:40.320
Here's what we're gonna do.

29:40.403 --> 29:43.698
You're gonna figure out a way
to get them off my property.

29:43.782 --> 29:47.368
That call center's not moving one goddamn inch!

30:06.638 --> 30:08.807
You gave it your best shot.

30:08.890 --> 30:11.684
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

30:11.768 --> 30:14.270
You went the distance for the old S.O.B.

30:14.354 --> 30:16.105
Above and beyond.

30:16.189 --> 30:20.026
-You should feel good about that.
-You think so.

30:21.319 --> 30:24.948
You gave Acker more than he deserved.

30:25.031 --> 30:28.785
And let's be real.

30:28.868 --> 30:31.746
Putting me on this, that was bad.

30:32.455 --> 30:35.458
I mean, if anyone found out...

30:35.542 --> 30:38.253
You risked a lot for this guy.

30:41.214 --> 30:46.803
Look, this time next week,
Acker will be living somewhere else.

30:46.886 --> 30:49.389
Is that really such a big deal?

30:49.472 --> 30:54.185
Plus, Mesa Verde, that's your bread and butter.

30:55.186 --> 30:58.022
You can only push them so far.

31:02.819 --> 31:05.738
There's always another play.

31:10.827 --> 31:14.372
But the rational thing to do here
is close the deal.

31:14.455 --> 31:15.748
Get the guy a few bucks.

31:15.832 --> 31:20.378
Pop the champagne with the other winners
and smile like you mean it.

31:21.379 --> 31:23.756
You want a beer? I'm gonna get one.

31:27.176 --> 31:28.011
Or?

31:38.730 --> 31:39.939
Jimmy?

31:41.691 --> 31:45.028
There's no reason on God's green earth
to take this further.

31:45.111 --> 31:47.113
It's not worth it.

31:52.785 --> 31:54.245
Or?

31:56.873 --> 31:57.874
Or...

31:58.875 --> 32:00.960
we go after Kevin Wachtell.

32:02.003 --> 32:04.714
It gets nasty. It gets personal.

32:04.797 --> 32:06.925
It gets dangerous.

32:29.697 --> 32:30.907
Okay.

32:33.826 --> 32:35.328
Okay.

33:14.242 --> 33:17.537
-Yeah?
JIMMY: <i>Hey, it's me.</i>

33:17.620 --> 33:19.580
-Yes, it is.
<i>-Great.</i>

33:19.664 --> 33:24.419
Uh, listen, I got something for you.
Hear me out, because this is a good thing.

33:24.502 --> 33:28.798
Uh, I'm sorry, I'm getting some kind of reverb
or something.

33:28.881 --> 33:32.093
<i>Are you in a tunnel, or...?</i>

33:32.176 --> 33:33.136
Yes.

33:34.137 --> 33:35.596
<i>What's that?</i>

33:36.848 --> 33:39.017
Yes. I'm in a tunnel.

33:40.018 --> 33:40.852
Okay.

33:40.935 --> 33:46.065
Uh, anyway, this is not like
that other thing, okay?

33:46.149 --> 33:48.943
Uh, it's a straight piece of oppo research.

33:49.027 --> 33:52.030
This is a lawyer hiring a P.I. What do you say?

33:53.072 --> 33:54.949
So you're back to being a lawyer?

33:55.033 --> 33:57.118
<i>Yeah. Yeah, totally legit. So...</i>

33:57.201 --> 33:59.912
Did I mention it's a paying gig?

33:59.996 --> 34:03.332
<i>-I'm not available.</i>
-Say again?

34:03.416 --> 34:04.959
No.

34:28.816 --> 34:30.443
<i>Señora.</i>

35:22.286 --> 35:24.747
Good. Good. Uh...

35:27.792 --> 35:29.377
Thank you.

35:49.021 --> 35:51.399
Oh, man.

36:04.745 --> 36:06.664
Take it easy.

36:06.747 --> 36:08.666
You don't need to be doing that.

36:08.749 --> 36:10.585
Don't be stubborn.

36:10.668 --> 36:15.882
Uh, it's okay. I'm fine. Thank you.

36:38.863 --> 36:41.032
You got this guy where?

36:41.115 --> 36:43.284
Same place as Huell.

36:43.367 --> 36:47.997
So it's like some kind of underground Craigslist?

36:49.332 --> 36:52.835
It's just a guy who knows people.

36:52.919 --> 36:54.754
People of a certain type.

36:55.755 --> 36:59.884
-He's very discreet.
-Well, he'd have to be.

37:09.936 --> 37:11.437
Here goes.

37:11.520 --> 37:14.398
It'll be fine. Just watch.

37:31.332 --> 37:33.960
I thought I was going to a law office.

37:34.043 --> 37:36.671
Yeah. This is a law office.

37:39.131 --> 37:40.716
Gotcha.

37:43.886 --> 37:47.556
Giselle, um, this is Mr. X.

37:50.476 --> 37:51.894
It's my work name.

37:52.895 --> 37:54.188
Ah.

37:55.731 --> 38:00.027
Mm. You know, those things
are full of parasites.

38:00.111 --> 38:03.781
Uh, yeah. Duly noted.
The conference room is in back.

38:03.864 --> 38:05.658
-Ah.
-Yeah.

38:05.741 --> 38:07.118
Yeah.

38:12.540 --> 38:16.419
-I did the full work-up as tasked.
-And?

38:16.502 --> 38:19.839
Snake eyes. Bupkes.
Nada. Guy is squeaky clean.

38:19.922 --> 38:23.801
That's impossible.
I mean, everybody's got something.

38:23.884 --> 38:24.927
Not this time.

38:25.011 --> 38:27.972
You got an Eagle Scout
with a six-figure income.

38:29.098 --> 38:31.017
-Arrests?
-Mm.

38:32.685 --> 38:34.270
DUI.

38:35.271 --> 38:37.315
In college, homecoming weekend.

38:37.398 --> 38:40.401
Thirty-four years ago.
Is that what you're looking for?

38:40.484 --> 38:42.987
Girlfriends? Offshore accounts?

38:43.070 --> 38:44.530
No secret bank accounts.

38:44.613 --> 38:49.285
No extra phones, no lunchtime quickies,
no lady friend, no boy toy.

38:49.368 --> 38:52.997
The guy's dull. Like, "Saturday night
in Salt Lake City" dull.

38:53.080 --> 38:57.335
No offense, but your work
is sounding kind of superficial.

39:01.589 --> 39:03.049
"Superficial"?

39:04.216 --> 39:06.677
-Yeah.
-Wow.

39:06.761 --> 39:10.389
Yeah, not hardly. I went the distance.

39:10.473 --> 39:13.100
I did a self-guided tour of his domicile.

39:13.184 --> 39:15.770
-All seven bedrooms, four and a half baths of it.
-Hold on.

39:15.853 --> 39:18.981
You're saying you broke into his house?

39:19.065 --> 39:22.360
Giselle, this is probably one of those
tricks-of-the-trade things.

39:22.443 --> 39:25.488
Probably just focus on the "what"
and skip over the "how."

39:25.571 --> 39:27.198
I'd like to know.

39:32.244 --> 39:37.249
He has a security system
with a touchy upstairs window sensor.

39:37.333 --> 39:40.169
I trip it a couple of times with an Airsoft...

39:41.170 --> 39:42.213
A BB gun.

39:44.131 --> 39:46.175
The alarm drives the housekeeper crazy.

39:46.258 --> 39:49.720
So I show up in coveralls, toolbox,
alarm company ID,

39:49.804 --> 39:53.349
and she is more than happy
to let me have the run of the place.

39:53.432 --> 39:56.811
Does that meet with your approval?

39:56.894 --> 40:00.398
-All right, so you get in, and you find what?
-Like I said. Nothing.

40:00.481 --> 40:02.858
No, there's no such thing as nothing.

40:02.942 --> 40:05.945
Okay? We want specifics.

40:06.028 --> 40:08.364
You want specifics? Okay, well.

40:08.447 --> 40:10.950
I got specifics.

40:15.955 --> 40:17.206
That's the home office.

40:17.289 --> 40:20.751
Now, I spent an extra four minutes
opening the floor safe.

40:20.835 --> 40:25.297
Nothing but life insurance policies,
a couple of rings and a commemorative half dollar.

40:25.381 --> 40:28.300
The guy's old school. No computers.

40:28.384 --> 40:31.429
Motel art on the walls,
paperwork on his desk.

40:31.512 --> 40:33.222
What kind of paperwork?

40:39.937 --> 40:42.148
You knock yourself out.

40:42.231 --> 40:47.987
Now, I may not be a nail salon lawyer,
but I know legit when I see it.

40:49.196 --> 40:52.908
So you gonna withdraw the "superficial" now?
Hmm?

40:55.035 --> 40:57.746
You think you could get
into his downtown office?

40:58.747 --> 41:01.417
MR. X:
Sure. I could.

41:01.500 --> 41:03.377
But there's a better way.

41:03.461 --> 41:05.129
Yeah?

41:05.212 --> 41:09.467
Yeah. I get two more guys.

41:09.550 --> 41:12.052
Guys who know how to handle themselves.

41:12.136 --> 41:16.390
Now, we roll up to the subject
in an unmarked van.

41:16.474 --> 41:20.769
We grab him, put him in a bag,
and we take him out to the desert.

41:20.853 --> 41:21.687
We're done here.

41:21.770 --> 41:25.149
End of the day, the banker's
giving you everything you're after, all right?

41:25.232 --> 41:26.817
JIMMY: We're done.
-No, no, no.

41:26.901 --> 41:31.197
-Look, you get keys to the kingdom, guaranteed.
-Okay, Sgt. Slaughter, back to the paintball field.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.240
Okay. The grownups need to talk. Let's go.

41:33.324 --> 41:35.451
That's fine. I'm just providing options for you.

41:35.534 --> 41:38.078
All right. This is the way out.
Exit through the gift shop.

41:38.162 --> 41:39.914
-All right.
-Don't touch anything, please.

41:39.997 --> 41:43.501
MR. X: I will not. Let me say on this one...
-I know you're...

41:59.308 --> 42:03.354
I don't know what to say. I'm gonna complain
to management about that clown.

42:03.437 --> 42:05.731
My usual guy is very reliable.

42:08.859 --> 42:10.986
What? What is it?

42:33.342 --> 42:34.677
Got a minute?

42:34.760 --> 42:36.220
Sure.

42:38.389 --> 42:39.682
How's everything?

42:40.683 --> 42:45.521
All good. Kind of crunched,
still dealing with the Tucumcari situation.

42:45.604 --> 42:47.022
Mm-hm.

42:47.106 --> 42:49.191
And the pro bono work?

42:51.068 --> 42:52.403
It's good.

42:54.280 --> 42:55.489
Is something up?

42:56.490 --> 42:58.075
Listen,

42:58.534 --> 43:01.537
I'm thinking
you could take a break from Mesa Verde.

43:03.289 --> 43:04.540
A break?

43:04.623 --> 43:09.587
A pair of mineral rights beefs just came in,
they practically have your name on them.

43:09.670 --> 43:12.381
You can split your time between that
and your pro bono clients.

43:13.591 --> 43:16.802
-Mesa Verde is my client.
-And they still will be.

43:16.885 --> 43:19.805
I'll just step in and take point,
just on a temporary basis.

43:19.888 --> 43:24.143
And, of course, this goes without saying,
this won't affect any of your compensation,

43:24.226 --> 43:25.853
and that includes your bonus.

43:25.936 --> 43:30.274
You know, Mesa Verde is fully informed
of any potential conflicts.

43:30.357 --> 43:32.192
Kevin signed off himself.

43:33.193 --> 43:36.905
Still, I think you're going to need
to take a break.

43:40.743 --> 43:44.121
-I don't understand where this is coming from.
-Don't you?

43:48.626 --> 43:52.338
Kim. Sometimes the less said, the better.

43:52.421 --> 43:55.174
-And why is that?
-Do we have to?

43:56.717 --> 43:58.344
Yes, we do.

44:00.846 --> 44:02.222
All right.

44:03.557 --> 44:08.479
First, I had to twist your arm
to get you down to Tucumcari for the eviction.

44:08.562 --> 44:11.982
Then you put the full-court press on Kevin
to change sites.

44:12.066 --> 44:16.236
That doesn't work, and abracadabra,
your boyfriend's opposing counsel.

44:17.363 --> 44:20.699
I told you, I explained the situation
to Kevin and Paige.

44:20.783 --> 44:22.368
Yeah. I know you did.

44:23.369 --> 44:27.081
And I'm sorry to say, I'm just not buying it.

44:41.095 --> 44:44.682
Rich? Rich. Hold on.

44:45.057 --> 44:47.935
What are you saying exactly?

44:49.103 --> 44:52.648
-Let's talk in my office.
-You are accusing me of something.

44:53.023 --> 44:54.483
Go ahead and say it.

44:55.484 --> 44:59.071
Are you talking about malfeasance?
Working against my client's interest? What?

44:59.154 --> 45:01.115
-Please.
-Rich, tell me.

45:01.198 --> 45:03.951
You know I worked my ass off to get here.
You know that.

45:04.034 --> 45:06.286
-Yes, I do know.
-So tell me.

45:06.370 --> 45:10.874
Please tell me why I would risk everything
for some squatter.

45:11.792 --> 45:15.921
Why? I don't understand. Are you trying
to protect the firm? From what?

45:16.004 --> 45:19.466
Kim, I am not trying to protect the firm,
I am trying to protect you.

45:19.550 --> 45:22.928
I don't need your protection.
I need to represent my client.

45:25.013 --> 45:26.807
If that's how you want it.

46:47.221 --> 46:49.556
So, what do you want from me?

46:50.891 --> 46:55.312
I think it best that Señora Cortazar
doesn't know about our association.

46:56.563 --> 47:00.901
I like to keep my business
as far from here as possible.

47:05.405 --> 47:07.074
You look much better.

47:08.075 --> 47:09.451
I am glad.

47:11.745 --> 47:17.751
So I'm here to see what a big heart you have,
is that the idea?

47:17.834 --> 47:20.837
You throw money at these people, they bow low.

47:21.588 --> 47:26.176
As far as the people here are concerned,
I am the doctor's friend. Nothing more.

47:26.260 --> 47:29.304
They had no idea
you financed the whole place.

47:29.388 --> 47:31.139
I prefer it that way.

47:31.223 --> 47:33.725
The anonymous benefactor.

47:35.143 --> 47:37.771
Well, that must make you feel pretty good.

47:39.481 --> 47:43.068
And is that supposed to balance the scales?

47:43.151 --> 47:46.071
Make up for everything else you do?

47:46.154 --> 47:48.490
It makes up for nothing.

47:50.033 --> 47:52.661
I am what I am.

47:55.831 --> 47:58.083
What is this place?

47:58.166 --> 48:01.003
Call it a memorial.

48:01.086 --> 48:02.671
To what?

48:08.927 --> 48:11.471
I already told you
what you can do with your money.

48:11.555 --> 48:16.935
You seem like a guy who can take a hint,
so what are we doing?

48:17.936 --> 48:21.607
It seems to me that you are at a crossroads.

48:21.690 --> 48:23.734
You can continue as you are.

48:25.569 --> 48:29.990
Drinking. Estranged from your family.

48:30.073 --> 48:31.867
Brawling with street hoods.

48:33.076 --> 48:35.370
We both know how that ends.

48:36.913 --> 48:39.708
-Yeah?
-You have another choice.

48:39.791 --> 48:41.126
Mm.

48:41.209 --> 48:43.629
Work for you as a button man.

48:45.005 --> 48:49.635
I'm in a war. I need a soldier.

48:50.010 --> 48:51.345
Mm.

48:51.428 --> 48:55.599
I'm gonna work for one drug dealer,
killing other drug dealers?

48:55.682 --> 48:57.476
That's your idea of a choice.

48:58.644 --> 49:01.897
You know better. You have met them.

49:03.357 --> 49:05.233
You know what they are.

49:05.317 --> 49:07.402
Meaning the Salamancas.

49:08.779 --> 49:11.448
And you are so very different from them?

49:12.449 --> 49:14.242
Yes.

49:14.326 --> 49:16.536
I am different.

49:17.537 --> 49:18.747
Huh.

49:22.834 --> 49:24.294
Why me?

49:25.379 --> 49:28.548
Because I believe that you understand.

49:28.632 --> 49:30.634
Understand what?

49:32.469 --> 49:34.179
Revenge.
