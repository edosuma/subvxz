WEBVTT

00:04.938 --> 00:08.567
-If you borrow my blender, return it.
-Come on, we're like Cain and Abel.

00:08.742 --> 00:10.710
Yeah, you know, Cain slew Abel.

00:10.877 --> 00:13.277
No, he didn't.
They were in business together.

00:13.446 --> 00:14.572
Dry wall or something.

00:14.748 --> 00:17.046
-Oh, no.
-All right, then what was it?

00:17.217 --> 00:20.209
Well, I think Abel worked hard
all summer harvesting his crops...

00:20.387 --> 00:22.981
...while Cain just played in the field.

00:23.156 --> 00:27.354
Then when winter came, Abel had
all the nuts, Cain had no nuts.

00:27.527 --> 00:28.755
So he killed him.

00:28.928 --> 00:31.590
The way I remember it, Cain,
he was a successful doctor...

00:31.765 --> 00:35.701
...but when he took this
special formula, he became Mr. Abel.

00:36.469 --> 00:37.766
You broke my blender.

00:37.937 --> 00:40.599
Yeah. Well, I was trying
to make gravel and it just--

00:40.774 --> 00:44.210
-It just didn't work out.
-I knew it.

00:46.613 --> 00:48.171
Why were you making gravel?

00:48.348 --> 00:51.579
Well, I like the sound it makes
when you walk on it.

00:52.619 --> 00:54.416
This looks familiar.

00:54.587 --> 00:55.918
Of course, it's garbage.

00:56.089 --> 00:58.057
No, no, no, no. These brown things.

00:58.224 --> 00:59.953
And the chairs.

01:00.126 --> 01:03.061
Jerry, this is the set
from the old <i>Merv Griffin Show.</i>

01:03.229 --> 01:05.459
They must be throwing it out.

01:05.632 --> 01:07.793
This stuff belongs
in the Smithsonian.

01:07.967 --> 01:10.492
Or at least in the dumpster
behind the Smithsonian.

01:12.639 --> 01:15.335
Boy, one minute Elliott Gould
is sitting on you...

01:15.508 --> 01:17.806
...and the next thing
you're yesterday's trash.

01:17.977 --> 01:19.274
Come on, get out of there.

01:19.446 --> 01:22.643
Oh, no, you go ahead.
I'm not finished taking this in.

01:23.183 --> 01:25.447
Jerry, look.

01:25.618 --> 01:26.744
Merv Griffin's cigar.

01:30.690 --> 01:34.456
You know, I spilled a yogurt smoothie
in here two days ago.

01:34.627 --> 01:36.094
Can't smell anything, can you?

01:36.262 --> 01:37.456
Banana?

01:38.298 --> 01:39.458
Right.

01:39.632 --> 01:41.293
George, watch out
for those pigeons.

01:41.468 --> 01:44.494
Oh, they'll get out of the way.
You really smell banana?

01:46.773 --> 01:48.866
Oh, my God.

01:50.143 --> 01:51.610
So...

01:52.112 --> 01:53.739
...where we eating?

01:57.650 --> 02:00.983
And it was his idea to put
a sprig of parsley on the plate.

02:01.154 --> 02:05.147
You're making this up.
There was never a Joseph Garnish.

02:06.359 --> 02:08.327
Oh, yeah. The toys.

02:08.495 --> 02:10.156
Where did you get all these?

02:10.330 --> 02:11.763
My dad was a collector.

02:11.931 --> 02:15.196
I inherited them after he died
from a long painful bout with--

02:15.368 --> 02:16.733
SuperBall.

02:17.437 --> 02:20.964
Hey, an original G.I. Joe...

02:21.141 --> 02:24.975
...with the full frogman suit.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.134
What are you doing?

02:26.312 --> 02:28.837
I'm putting this on him
and we're going to the sink.

02:29.015 --> 02:30.676
No, Jerry...

02:30.850 --> 02:32.442
...they're priceless.

02:32.619 --> 02:34.314
They've never been played with.

02:34.487 --> 02:38.287
-I just wanna touch them a little.
-I said, no.

02:38.458 --> 02:40.858
Now, come here.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:50.303 --> 02:51.736
Hi.

02:52.305 --> 02:55.138
I'm Lou Filerman. I'm new here.

02:59.312 --> 03:02.042
Hey, Walter.
What is the deal with that guy?

03:02.215 --> 03:04.046
He's Lou Filerman. He's new here.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.950
Hey, your coffee stain looks like
Fidel Castro.

03:09.422 --> 03:12.050
You've been an enormous help.

03:13.259 --> 03:16.251
You ran over some pigeons?
How many?

03:16.429 --> 03:18.260
Whatever they had.

03:18.831 --> 03:21.925
Miranda thinks I'm a butcher.
But it's not my fault, is it?

03:22.101 --> 03:24.729
Don't we have a deal
with the pigeons?

03:25.505 --> 03:26.665
Of course we have a deal.

03:26.839 --> 03:28.431
They get out of the way of cars...

03:28.608 --> 03:31.133
...we look the other way
on the statue defecation.

03:31.311 --> 03:33.802
Right. And these pigeons
broke the deal.

03:33.980 --> 03:36.244
I will not accept the blame for this.

03:36.616 --> 03:39.710
-So Miranda's cooled on you?
-I'm getting nothing.

03:40.386 --> 03:41.375
Yeah, me neither.

03:41.554 --> 03:43.317
I thought you were sleeping together.

03:43.489 --> 03:46.117
Oh, the sex is wild,
but she's got this toy collection...

03:46.292 --> 03:48.089
...and she won't let me near it.

03:48.995 --> 03:50.428
I don't understand women.

03:50.597 --> 03:51.586
Here comes one.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.723
Hey. What's going on?

03:55.168 --> 03:57.830
Hey. Art Garfunkel?

03:58.004 --> 04:00.939
-No, Castro.
-Right.

04:01.107 --> 04:03.837
It's all because of this
creepy new guy at work.

04:04.010 --> 04:07.275
He just comes out of nowhere
and he's right next to you.

04:07.447 --> 04:08.641
So he just sidles up?

04:08.815 --> 04:13.047
That's right. He's a real sidler.

04:13.953 --> 04:16.148
-Maybe you didn't see him.
-You never see him.

04:16.322 --> 04:17.983
He sidled me again in my office.

04:18.156 --> 04:19.784
I was sitting making Cup-a-Soup...

04:19.959 --> 04:22.154
...singing that song
from <i>The Lion King.</i>

04:22.795 --> 04:23.989
"Hakuna Matata"?

04:24.597 --> 04:27.464
-I thought I was alone.
-That doesn't make it right.

04:30.603 --> 04:33.265
To me, the Hakuna Matata
is not nearly as embarrassing...

04:33.439 --> 04:35.703
-...as the Cup-a-Soup.
-Would you just...

04:35.875 --> 04:36.899
...let it go?

04:37.076 --> 04:39.840
Hey, Jerry. Come here a sec.

04:40.546 --> 04:41.774
Oh, yeah.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.438
Hey.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.208
Oh, my God.

04:45.385 --> 04:48.218
It's the <i>Merv Griffin</i> set.

04:49.856 --> 04:51.448
How did you get this in here?

04:51.624 --> 04:55.685
Oh, you just bring it in sideways
and hook it.

04:56.229 --> 05:00.029
-So where are you gonna sleep?
-Backstage.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.600
This chair smells like garbage.

05:04.771 --> 05:06.432
A lot of the stars from the '70s...

05:06.606 --> 05:09.370
...they were not as hygienic
as they appeared on TV.

05:09.542 --> 05:12.375
You take Mannix, for example.

05:12.712 --> 05:13.701
I'm gonna get that.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.644
Well, Jerry we'd love
to have you back any time.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.518
Well, Elaine Benes....

05:21.688 --> 05:23.918
Well, it's great to have you.

05:24.590 --> 05:26.820
Is it possible
you're even more beautiful...

05:26.993 --> 05:28.654
...than the last time I saw you?

05:46.846 --> 05:48.609
We had a deal.

05:49.682 --> 05:53.516
-Mr. Peterman, here are these pages--
-One moment.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.517
I'm reading
the fascinating article...

05:55.688 --> 05:58.521
...on the most fascinating people
of the year.

05:58.691 --> 06:02.183
And done.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.388
Oh, yes.
I'm sorry, I needed this so quickly.

06:05.565 --> 06:08.625
It must have been a lot of work.
Thank you very much, you two.

06:08.801 --> 06:10.769
What?

06:13.940 --> 06:16.602
Three dates and she still
won't let me play with the toys.

06:16.776 --> 06:18.038
That's interesting.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.475
Someone mentioned to me
you were not very happy...

06:20.646 --> 06:22.409
...with your toys growing up.

06:22.582 --> 06:25.073
Yeah, that was me.

06:25.251 --> 06:26.741
That's right, right.

06:26.919 --> 06:30.480
And you mentioned that you didn't get
a G.I. Joe. You had....

06:30.656 --> 06:33.090
-An Army Pete.
-Right.

06:33.259 --> 06:36.387
He was made of wood, in the rain
he would swell up and then split.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.332
And we all know
how painful that can be.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.130
-Jerry? Oh, there you are.
-Oh, Elaine Benes.

06:47.306 --> 06:50.434
Well, this is quite a thrill.
Yes, come.

06:53.212 --> 06:55.510
Yes, sit down. Yes.

06:55.681 --> 06:59.082
Well, I'll tell you, this sidler guy
is really chapping my hide.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.241
Excuse me?

07:00.420 --> 07:03.184
Yeah, we're talking this way.

07:03.623 --> 07:05.523
He's getting credit
for work that I did.

07:05.691 --> 07:07.818
He's gonna sidle me
right out of a job.

07:07.994 --> 07:12.192
Now, for those of us who don't know,
sidling is what?

07:12.899 --> 07:14.628
Kramer, what is wrong with you?

07:16.369 --> 07:17.358
What do you mean?

07:17.537 --> 07:19.971
Well, for starters,
you're looking at note cards.

07:21.541 --> 07:24.032
I'm gonna give that guy
a taste of his own medicine.

07:24.210 --> 07:27.475
So I am going to sidle the sidler.

07:27.647 --> 07:31.606
You sidle? You stomp around
like a Clydesdale.

07:31.784 --> 07:33.081
Not with these honeys.

07:33.252 --> 07:35.152
Wrestling shoes.

07:35.321 --> 07:38.256
Only in New York.

07:40.660 --> 07:42.651
Jerry?

07:44.230 --> 07:47.199
Hey. Well, ladies and gentlemen.

07:47.366 --> 07:50.460
It's our good friend,
George Costanza.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.695
What a surprise.

07:58.744 --> 08:00.974
<i>Turn music off.</i>

08:01.681 --> 08:03.239
Yeah, sit, sit.

08:08.020 --> 08:10.011
-Well, it happened again.
-What happened?

08:10.523 --> 08:12.081
I'll ask the questions.

08:14.360 --> 08:15.725
What happened?

08:16.896 --> 08:20.525
Well, I just stomped some pigeons
in the park. They didn't move.

08:20.700 --> 08:24.158
All right. Let's change the subject.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.864
Now, you and Jerry dated for a while.
Tell us...

08:28.040 --> 08:29.837
...what was that like?

08:33.479 --> 08:35.447
It's the wrong card.

08:37.149 --> 08:39.811
I don't get these birds.
They're breaking the deal.

08:39.986 --> 08:42.284
It's like the pigeons decided
to ignore me.

08:42.455 --> 08:43.922
So they're like everyone else.

08:46.559 --> 08:48.857
All right, let's take a short break.

09:02.742 --> 09:04.903
Okay, we're back.

09:09.815 --> 09:12.079
Boy, that bank clock
is eight minutes off.

09:12.251 --> 09:14.776
Then why don't you just
run it over too?

09:25.398 --> 09:27.161
George, what are you doing?

09:27.533 --> 09:29.433
Did you see that?
That pigeon didn't move.

09:29.602 --> 09:32.400
I had to swerve out of the way.
I saved that pigeon's life.

09:32.572 --> 09:36.975
What pigeon?
You drove right into that squirrel.

09:37.209 --> 09:39.200
Squirrel?

09:39.378 --> 09:42.108
Well, we have no deal with them.

09:53.326 --> 09:56.853
Jerry, those hands. They never stop.

09:57.029 --> 09:58.621
I'm sorry.

09:58.798 --> 10:01.426
You got any booze?
What say you and I get ripped.

10:02.001 --> 10:04.834
No, thanks. I have a headache.

10:05.004 --> 10:07.802
Can you just get me an aspirin?

10:08.207 --> 10:09.799
All right.

10:13.779 --> 10:16.942
"Will not cause drowsiness."

10:18.217 --> 10:21.880
"May cause drowsiness."

10:27.994 --> 10:29.484
Here's the new copy you wanted.

10:29.662 --> 10:31.493
Oh, yes.

10:32.098 --> 10:36.967
Well, this certainly looks like
a lot of words in record time.

10:37.603 --> 10:40.367
I'm very impressed with both of you.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.038
Thank you.

10:45.211 --> 10:49.113
Unfortunately, I am also disgusted.

10:49.281 --> 10:51.841
This is incoherent drivel.

10:52.585 --> 10:55.053
This is a total redo...

10:55.221 --> 10:58.418
...and I'm assuming I need it
right away.

10:59.025 --> 11:00.890
Well, I guess we'll just have--

11:04.830 --> 11:07.822
Oh, just give me that.

11:18.944 --> 11:21.378
Mission accomplished.
Back to base, Joe.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.683
Doctor, is the squirrel going to live?

11:29.855 --> 11:33.484
There's been massive trauma.
We could, of course, try to save him...

11:33.659 --> 11:37.026
...but it would be costly, difficult,
and we'd have to send away...

11:37.196 --> 11:39.596
...for some special,
really tiny instruments.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.632
Well, are there any other options?

11:43.803 --> 11:45.532
We could put him to sleep.

11:46.072 --> 11:47.437
What might that cost?

11:47.973 --> 11:51.636
Well, it's by the pound,
so about 80 cents.

11:51.811 --> 11:53.005
-Well....
-George.

11:53.179 --> 11:55.374
I was just-- I was curious, that's all.

11:58.951 --> 12:01.419
We'd like you to do
everything possible.

12:01.587 --> 12:04.055
He's not gonna be the same,
you know?

12:04.223 --> 12:06.453
Yeah, yeah, I know.

12:07.760 --> 12:10.627
So they're flying
the tiny instruments in from El Paso.

12:11.197 --> 12:15.031
El Paso.
I spent a month there one night.

12:16.535 --> 12:18.503
El Paso.

12:19.939 --> 12:21.304
What's he here for?

12:21.474 --> 12:24.204
Well, he takes some of the pressure
off of me.

12:24.376 --> 12:26.037
So, Jerry what's going on with you?

12:26.212 --> 12:29.648
I understand there's a young lady
in your life.

12:29.815 --> 12:33.307
Actually, it's kind of a funny story,
because she has this toy collection...

12:33.486 --> 12:35.454
...and last night,
I got to play with them.

12:35.621 --> 12:38.021
Well, sounds like things
are progressing.

12:38.190 --> 12:39.487
Do I hear wedding bells?

12:39.658 --> 12:42.149
-Are you married right now?
-Newman.

12:42.328 --> 12:43.989
She doesn't even know
about the toys.

12:44.163 --> 12:48.759
I gave her the wrong kind of medicine
and I guess she passed out.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.663
What do you mean, wrong kind?

12:50.836 --> 12:52.895
She's got that Mattel
football game we loved.

12:53.072 --> 12:54.471
You gotta get me over there.

12:54.640 --> 12:57.302
Wait a minute. You mean
to say that you drugged a woman...

12:57.476 --> 13:00.411
...so you could take advantage
of her toys?

13:00.579 --> 13:03.013
Let's pause a moment.

13:05.351 --> 13:06.375
Jerry...

13:06.552 --> 13:09.112
...what you do with your
personal life is your business.

13:09.288 --> 13:12.121
But when you're on my set,
you clean it up, mister.

13:12.558 --> 13:13.855
I told you he was a risk.

13:14.026 --> 13:16.893
Oh, like he's not just carrying you,
and has been for years.

13:17.062 --> 13:20.156
Yeah, well, you bombed. That story
stunk worse than these chairs.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.696
Smile, everyone. We're back.

13:26.405 --> 13:28.396
-You wanted to see me, Elaine?
-Yes, Lou.

13:29.341 --> 13:31.536
You've got a lot going for you.

13:31.710 --> 13:34.508
You're spontaneous.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.978
You're symmetrical.

13:40.452 --> 13:41.885
You're very quick, aren't you?

13:43.689 --> 13:46.214
It's just that you're:

13:46.692 --> 13:48.091
My dead tooth?

13:49.128 --> 13:51.096
No.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.192
You're:

13:55.701 --> 13:56.690
What, my breath?

13:58.504 --> 13:59.493
What can I do?

13:59.672 --> 14:04.166
Well, you should never, ever
go anywhere without these.

14:04.343 --> 14:07.005
Thanks, Elaine.
You're such a super lady.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.717
More wine and turkey?

14:21.060 --> 14:25.520
So when I saw George with an
18-pound turkey and a box of wine...

14:25.698 --> 14:28.531
...I thought, "What a coincidence,
we're just about to eat."

14:29.001 --> 14:31.561
What is that stuff in turkey
that makes you sleepy?

14:31.737 --> 14:32.897
-Tryptophan.
-Tryptophan.

14:34.173 --> 14:35.367
I think.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.634
Have some more wine.

14:37.843 --> 14:39.242
What video did you get?

14:39.411 --> 14:43.609
Oh, George brought home movies
of his boyhood trip to Michigan.

14:44.483 --> 14:45.711
Four hours.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.479
More heavy gravy?

14:50.322 --> 14:54.088
Yes. Touchdown. Your turn, Jerry.

15:00.165 --> 15:04.727
Lately though, I've been buying
the generic brand of wax beans.

15:06.171 --> 15:08.401
You know, I rip off the label...

15:08.574 --> 15:10.804
...I can hardly tell the difference.

15:11.310 --> 15:14.245
We've officially bottomed out.

15:15.347 --> 15:18.111
-Who's our next guest?
-We got no one.

15:18.984 --> 15:22.613
We need a new format.
We should shut down and retool.

15:37.603 --> 15:41.767
-What about a guest host?
-I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

15:44.343 --> 15:46.834
-Doctor, how's the squirrel?
-Is he dead?

15:48.013 --> 15:52.416
No, fortunately the special
tiny instruments arrived just in time.

15:52.584 --> 15:55.610
-Would you like to visit him?
-Yes, he would.

16:01.226 --> 16:04.127
You have 30 minutes.

16:11.437 --> 16:12.870
So...

16:14.306 --> 16:15.773
...squirrel.

16:18.043 --> 16:19.943
One more thing, Mr. Costanza.

16:20.112 --> 16:23.673
We just need to know what time
you'll be picking him up tomorrow.

16:23.849 --> 16:25.009
What's that?

16:25.184 --> 16:29.245
Oh, we're discharging the squirrel.
We think he'll be better off at home.

16:29.722 --> 16:32.213
He has no home. He's a squirrel.

16:33.359 --> 16:34.519
Your home, Mr. Costanza.

16:34.693 --> 16:37.161
Just make sure he gets his medicine
six times a day...

16:37.329 --> 16:39.559
...and keep his tail elevated.

16:43.135 --> 16:44.830
Maybe it'll be fun having a pet.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.438
It's not a pet. It's a wild invalid.

16:48.907 --> 16:50.841
And it knows that I tried to kill it.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.946
As soon as it gets better, it's gonna
gnaw my brain out in my sleep.

16:55.514 --> 16:58.244
Jerry. Hey.
What are you doing tomorrow?

16:58.417 --> 17:01.409
-I want you to come by.
-What about my questionable material?

17:01.587 --> 17:03.851
No, we got a whole new format.
Edgy, youthful.

17:04.022 --> 17:07.424
-Plus, we got Jim Fowler.
-Jim Fowler?

17:07.593 --> 17:09.891
The animal guy from Wild Kingdom
is coming?

17:10.061 --> 17:13.122
Well, I practically raised his kids.

17:14.133 --> 17:16.328
Perfect, a zoo guy.
He takes care of animals.

17:16.502 --> 17:17.799
Can I bring the squirrel by?

17:18.303 --> 17:20.771
Two animal acts on the same show?

17:20.939 --> 17:22.930
Is this amateur hour?

17:23.108 --> 17:26.599
Look, George, I'm sorry,
maybe another time, all right?

17:27.146 --> 17:28.170
I gotta get to Fowler.

17:28.347 --> 17:30.008
I know he would take this squirrel.

17:30.182 --> 17:32.742
-It's practically bionic.
-Hey.

17:34.520 --> 17:35.885
Nice sidle, huh?

17:36.055 --> 17:39.786
Speaking of which,
I think I've got that problem solved.

17:39.958 --> 17:40.982
Tic Tacs work?

17:41.160 --> 17:43.492
He's a human maraca.

17:44.530 --> 17:47.226
Boy, my knuckles are still cramped
from that football game.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.299
You took him over to Celia's?

17:49.468 --> 17:51.060
What? It's a victimless crime.

17:51.603 --> 17:54.936
What about the woman who's been
drugged and taken advantage of?

17:55.107 --> 17:56.938
Okay, one victim.

17:57.543 --> 17:59.238
I think it's unconscionable.

17:59.411 --> 18:02.938
Last night, I found a whole Weeble
village behind the Easy-Bake Oven.

18:03.115 --> 18:04.173
Easy-Bake Oven?

18:05.684 --> 18:07.515
Who wants a cupcake?

18:07.686 --> 18:08.914
Me, me, me, me, me.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.413
You know that batter is like
30 years old.

18:12.591 --> 18:14.286
<i>You step on it and it flushes.</i>

18:14.460 --> 18:17.759
Why is your father giving a tour
of a rest stop?

18:17.930 --> 18:21.297
-<i>Stop squirming.</i>
-Don't. This is where they change me.

18:21.467 --> 18:23.128
-You're like 8 years old.
-<i>Georgie</i>.

18:23.302 --> 18:25.770
I was 7 and a half.

18:31.910 --> 18:33.377
That noise.

18:33.545 --> 18:35.877
-That's the noise.
-What?

18:36.048 --> 18:38.243
That infernal rattling
that has plagued me...

18:38.417 --> 18:41.409
...these past two days,
and I could not find the source.

18:41.587 --> 18:44.078
In my office, in the hallway...

18:44.256 --> 18:47.350
...even in the men's room.
Shame on you, Elaine.

18:47.526 --> 18:49.494
No, no, Mr. Peterman.
That wasn't me.

18:49.661 --> 18:53.028
That reminds me of
the Haitian voodoo rattle torture.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.661
You haven't gone over to their side,
have you?

18:57.469 --> 18:58.959
No, Mr. Peterman.

18:59.138 --> 19:03.802
Because if I hear one more rattle,
just one, you're out on your can.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.608
And if you are undead...

19:07.779 --> 19:10.714
...I'll find out about that too.

19:25.731 --> 19:27.824
Lou. In here.

19:28.433 --> 19:29.422
We have to talk.

19:29.601 --> 19:31.569
-Oh, right.
-Stop it.

19:31.737 --> 19:32.999
Bad voodoo.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.572
-You've gotta stop using these.
-Why?

19:36.008 --> 19:38.101
Because they're turning
your teeth green.

19:38.277 --> 19:40.006
I only buy the white ones.

19:40.746 --> 19:44.375
Okay. Well, then your teeth
are green for a different reason.

19:44.550 --> 19:47.178
You gotta stop carrying these, okay?
Just use mouthwash.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.912
I can't. It burns my cankers.

19:50.856 --> 19:51.845
Binaca.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.652
-Again.
-Right, right, cankers.

19:54.826 --> 19:57.260
-I got it. Chew gum.
-I hate gum.

19:57.429 --> 20:00.364
The only gum I liked came with
the Mickey Mouse gumball machine.

20:00.532 --> 20:02.397
They stopped making that
20 years ago.

20:03.302 --> 20:05.634
Well, stinky, this is your lucky day.

20:08.740 --> 20:12.972
Okay, a little later we're gonna be
talking with animal expert, Jim Fowler.

20:13.145 --> 20:15.079
Where are the cameras?

20:16.081 --> 20:19.050
But first, we're talking with Jerry.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.114
Hey, Jerry...

20:22.287 --> 20:26.951
...you drugged a woman
in order to play with her toy collection.

20:27.125 --> 20:28.820
How do you feel about that?

20:28.994 --> 20:31.986
It was great. I've done it
a few more times since then.

20:32.164 --> 20:34.724
And she doesn't know
anything about this?

20:34.900 --> 20:36.162
No. Not a thing.

20:36.335 --> 20:40.499
Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise
for you. Come on out, Celia.

20:41.006 --> 20:43.668
What kind of sick, twisted creep
are you?

20:46.979 --> 20:48.970
What is this?
What is she doing here?

20:49.147 --> 20:52.082
What? It's the new format.
Scandals and animals.

20:52.251 --> 20:56.244
If you think you can drug me and play,
you've got another thing coming.

20:56.421 --> 20:58.252
Go, girl.

20:58.423 --> 21:01.950
Well, what kind of woman
drinks an entire box of wine?

21:04.162 --> 21:08.428
Mr. Fowler, I have a squirrel here
that is a miracle of modern science.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.033
I told you, we're booked.

21:10.202 --> 21:12.830
Careful. Hawks and squirrels
don't get along together.

21:13.205 --> 21:16.504
Another interesting confrontation.
This could be spicy, bring him over.

21:17.209 --> 21:19.200
No, you idiot. Hawks eat squirrels.

21:29.187 --> 21:31.121
Are we getting this?

21:34.693 --> 21:36.490
So the whole set was destroyed?

21:36.662 --> 21:40.120
Well, the squirrel kept scurrying
and the hawk kept clawing.

21:40.299 --> 21:43.894
Well, at least we know that
prosthetic squirrel hips work.

21:44.503 --> 21:46.266
Sorry about the set.

21:46.438 --> 21:49.805
I'll tell you, it was a grind
having to fill 10 hours a day.

21:49.975 --> 21:53.502
I'm not sure I was ready
to have my own talk show set.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.708
I got the nut bread, George.
Let's go.

21:59.051 --> 22:00.518
So the squirrel's gonna make it?

22:00.686 --> 22:02.847
Yeah, he's in my bed.

22:03.422 --> 22:05.014
I'm sleeping on the couch.

22:05.190 --> 22:07.158
On the couch? So you're--

22:07.326 --> 22:08.486
Still getting nothing.

22:12.097 --> 22:15.692
Oh, go ahead, pigeons. Laugh it up.

22:16.034 --> 22:21.165
I'm getting in my car now,
and the last I heard, we have no deal.

22:22.007 --> 22:25.443
I'm glad you called, Elaine.
I really needed to talk to someone.

22:25.610 --> 22:29.603
Oh, well, hey, I dated Jerry too.
I know what a monster he can be.

22:29.781 --> 22:31.510
More wine and turkey?

22:33.118 --> 22:35.052
-Who's he?
-Oh, he's nobody.

22:35.220 --> 22:38.383
Hey, listen,
let me top that off for you.
