10:57.146 --> 10:59.939
I can't go back to Santa, man!
I can't!

10:59.940 --> 11:02.024
- Hello again.
- Hi.

11:02.025 --> 11:05.445
That's the guy that was peeing
in the women's bathroom.

11:11.160 --> 11:15.079
Stewie, when this is over,
I'm buying you a new toy.

11:15.080 --> 11:17.415
Meg, when this is over,
I'm putting rocks in my pockets

11:17.416 --> 11:20.042
and walking
into the mall fountain.

11:20.043 --> 11:21.752
How much longer
is this gonna take?

11:21.753 --> 11:23.796
I don't know. 400 minutes?

11:23.797 --> 11:25.756
One reason I work
as a seasonal elf

11:25.757 --> 11:27.425
is I'm not great
at time estimates.

11:27.426 --> 11:29.802
- MALL SANTA: Next.
- See? 400 minutes.

11:29.803 --> 11:33.681
Even a broken clock
is right six times a day.

11:33.682 --> 11:35.975
He's very scared,
so I have to sit here with him.

11:35.976 --> 11:37.435
Would you mind
bouncing me a little?

11:37.436 --> 11:40.396
Um, okay. I guess I can do that.

11:40.397 --> 11:42.648
Hey, come on,
a little harder than that.

11:42.649 --> 11:45.568
- Look, I don't feel comf...
- Please! It's Christmas. Please!

11:45.569 --> 11:49.614
- What does... what does that
have to do with...
- Just do it!

11:49.615 --> 11:51.824
(crying):
♪ <i>The itsy-bitsy spider</i> ♪

11:51.825 --> 11:54.368
♪ <i>Went up the water spout...</i> ♪

11:54.369 --> 11:55.995
Wait, wait,
th-this isn't working.

11:55.996 --> 11:58.247
Were you at the Quahog Mall
last night?

11:58.248 --> 12:01.834
No. L-Last night, I was weeping
outside my ex-wife's apartment.

12:01.835 --> 12:04.170
I drank too much
and went over to yell at her.

12:04.171 --> 12:05.588
Yeah, he's not your guy, Meg.

12:05.589 --> 12:08.299
They said my Santa would
be here, and you're not him.

12:08.300 --> 12:10.384
I'm sorry. Story of my life.

12:10.385 --> 12:12.386
I live to disappoint women,
apparently.

12:12.387 --> 12:15.473
Well, where is he?
Where's my Santa?

12:15.474 --> 12:17.683
- I don't know!
- I need to find him.

12:17.684 --> 12:19.518
He made me a woman!

12:19.519 --> 12:21.438
Where is he?

12:22.439 --> 12:23.397
(gasping)

12:23.398 --> 12:24.982
He's a phony!

12:24.983 --> 12:27.068
A great, big phony!

12:27.069 --> 12:29.695
Excuse me, ma'am, I'm gonna
give you just 600 minutes

12:29.696 --> 12:31.697
- to get out of here.
- But you don't understand.

12:31.698 --> 12:34.116
One, two, 600 minutes.

12:34.117 --> 12:36.452
That's it. Security!

12:36.453 --> 12:37.870
What took you so long?

12:37.871 --> 12:39.455
Let me go.

12:39.456 --> 12:42.083
Lady, by the power vested in me
by Paul Blart,

12:42.084 --> 12:44.001
you are now banned
from this mall

12:44.002 --> 12:46.254
and every mall in this county.

12:46.255 --> 12:50.049
(grunting): W-Wait.
I need my little brother.

12:50.050 --> 12:51.927
Stewie!

12:54.554 --> 12:57.724
Time to sleep in heavenly peace.

12:59.476 --> 13:01.018
(groans)

13:01.019 --> 13:03.688
Wow, looks like
that baby is all wet.

13:03.689 --> 13:06.023
(laughing)

13:06.024 --> 13:07.441
Classic Woody.

13:07.442 --> 13:08.777
(laughs)
This is Woody.

13:15.321 --> 13:17.947
So, you want to tell me
why you were assaulting Santa

13:17.948 --> 13:19.574
in front of the whole mall?

13:19.575 --> 13:21.326
What about Beard Boy?

13:21.327 --> 13:23.532
Santa is Beard Boy.

13:23.534 --> 13:25.410
You're in love with Santa?

13:25.411 --> 13:26.703
Maybe.

13:26.704 --> 13:29.497
He gave me my first... you know.

13:29.498 --> 13:32.167
He just bounced me on his lap,
and the next thing you know,

13:32.168 --> 13:34.043
- I saw Jimmy Connors.
- You saw Jimmy Connors.

13:34.044 --> 13:36.546
It happens to every girl
their first time.

13:36.547 --> 13:38.214
You'll never see him again,
by the way.

13:38.215 --> 13:39.924
I won't? Why not?

13:39.925 --> 13:42.927
I don't know.
That's God's trick on women.

13:42.928 --> 13:45.138
It's your first time,
followed by a lifetime

13:45.139 --> 13:46.849
of diminishing returns.

13:48.100 --> 13:49.894
(squeaking)

13:52.813 --> 13:55.816
I wonder what I'll see
on my first time.

14:13.709 --> 14:16.544
I can't let Stewie grow up
scared of Santa Claus.

14:16.545 --> 14:18.129
(clears throat)

14:18.130 --> 14:19.964
(deep voice):
Ho, ho, ho.

14:19.965 --> 14:21.633
Santa? Is that really you?

14:21.634 --> 14:24.052
- Sure is.
- Well, how'd you get in?

14:24.053 --> 14:26.179
- Through the window.
- It was just unlocked?

14:26.180 --> 14:29.224
Like, anybody can just come
through my window at any time?

14:29.225 --> 14:30.893
- I really don't like...
- Forget about that.

14:32.269 --> 14:34.187
I know you're having
a tough time.

14:34.188 --> 14:37.315
I just wanted to tell you
that everything is fine.

14:37.316 --> 14:40.777
Meg is entering probably
the most horny part of her life.

14:40.778 --> 14:42.821
This could just as easily
have happened

14:42.822 --> 14:44.572
while she was riding a horse
or something.

14:44.573 --> 14:46.449
I'm just sorry
you had to see it.

14:46.450 --> 14:49.744
Okay. Don't want people
just coming in whenever.

14:49.745 --> 14:52.997
Stewie, that Christmas magic
you think you lost,

14:52.998 --> 14:54.958
it can't just disappear.

14:54.959 --> 14:57.961
I'm still the same guy
you've always loved.

14:57.962 --> 15:00.922
Thanks, Santa. I feel better.

15:00.923 --> 15:02.966
Just try to have
a good Christmas.

15:02.967 --> 15:05.009
Uh, speaking of that,
I want a new dog.

15:05.010 --> 15:06.970
What's wrong with
the dog you have?

15:06.971 --> 15:09.848
Eh, he's okay.
I just... I just want a new one.

15:09.849 --> 15:12.433
Maybe you can spend more time
with the old one

15:12.434 --> 15:15.103
- before you make any decisions.
- Nah. Want a new one.

15:15.104 --> 15:17.272
Thanks, Santa.
Can you leave from the door?

15:17.273 --> 15:19.190
I'm kind of freaking
over the window thing.

15:19.191 --> 15:20.693
Sure.

15:22.361 --> 15:24.153
CHRIS:
Oh, my God. Santa?

15:24.154 --> 15:27.324
- I want a new dog.
- BRIAN: Oh, come on!

15:31.120 --> 15:32.620
There you are.

15:32.621 --> 15:34.706
I had a hell of a time
finding your room.

15:34.707 --> 15:36.749
Can I come in?

15:36.750 --> 15:39.085
- Cigarette?
- No.

15:39.086 --> 15:40.880
Mind if I have one?

15:42.923 --> 15:46.509
So, you want to talk about
this whole Santa's lap thing?

15:46.510 --> 15:50.263
Dad, this stuff, I-I think it's
gonna be hard for you to hear.

15:50.264 --> 15:51.973
Oh, don't worry, Meg.
I brought this handkerchief

15:51.974 --> 15:55.101
to dab my forehead whenever
you say something sexual.

15:55.102 --> 15:57.103
- So, I'm-I'm sitting
on Santa's lap...
- Oh, dear.

15:57.104 --> 15:59.188
...and it's like my whole body
starts to tingle.

15:59.189 --> 16:01.566
- Oh, my stars.
- And-and then there's,
like, a-a deep...

16:01.567 --> 16:03.026
I better loudly drop
an Alka-Seltzer

16:03.027 --> 16:04.736
in this glass of water.

16:04.737 --> 16:07.322
- (fizzing)
- Very loud fizzing.

16:07.323 --> 16:09.240
I-I may need to widen my eyes

16:09.241 --> 16:11.159
until they look like
a young girl's Snapchat filter.

16:11.160 --> 16:13.036
Like, sort of
a-a warm steam iron?

16:13.037 --> 16:15.413
Okay. It's okay, Meg.

16:15.414 --> 16:19.042
Look, this Santa person
clearly made you very happy.

16:19.043 --> 16:21.711
And I want my daughter
to be happy.

16:21.712 --> 16:24.797
Go find your mall Santa,
wherever he is.

16:24.798 --> 16:26.341
I love you, Dad.

16:26.342 --> 16:28.134
And thanks for the pep talk.

16:28.135 --> 16:30.011
Hey, I learned from the best.

16:30.012 --> 16:33.806
You know, I played football for
Coach Joe Paterno at Penn State.

16:33.807 --> 16:36.017
All right, team,
remember everything you learned

16:36.018 --> 16:37.769
in practice this week

16:37.770 --> 16:40.939

Do you have a big cup
I can pee in for my ride home?

Take my mostly done Jamba Juice.

Meg?

Santa?

Yes, Meg. It's me, Santa.

18:11.321 --> 18:13.281
Oh, my God, there's a bench
right over there.

18:13.282 --> 18:14.615
Quick, let me sit on your leg.

18:14.616 --> 18:16.367
No, that's not
what I'm here for.

18:16.368 --> 18:17.785
Yes, it is. Now, sit down.

18:17.786 --> 18:20.413
Meg, no. Meg, no. Get off.

18:20.414 --> 18:22.623
Geez, I'm trying to give you
a heartwarming message

18:22.624 --> 18:24.333
of Christmas joy.

18:24.334 --> 18:26.753
You know, the same feeling
you got when you were five

18:26.754 --> 18:28.713
and I gave you
that Malibu Barbie?

18:28.714 --> 18:30.214
How did you know that?

18:30.215 --> 18:32.383
I told you. I'm the real Santa.

18:32.384 --> 18:35.553
I try to visit every mall
at least once during Christmas.

18:35.554 --> 18:37.388

18:37.389 --> 18:38.806

18:38.807 --> 18:40.600
Oh, no.

18:40.601 --> 18:44.228
I can't believe I, you know,
grew up all over you.

18:44.229 --> 18:46.272
It's okay, Meg. You see, I know

18:46.273 --> 18:49.358
what each and every person
needs for Christmas.

18:49.359 --> 18:52.945
For you, it was your first
time seeing Jimmy Connors.

18:52.946 --> 18:55.990
But the truth is,
it had nothing to do with me.

18:55.991 --> 18:58.701
The Christmas magic
lives in there.

18:58.702 --> 19:02.288

it'll always be with you.
