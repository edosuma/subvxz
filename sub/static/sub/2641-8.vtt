WEBVTT

00:01.924 --> 00:03.642
How much time do we have?

00:03.726 --> 00:05.827
Uh, t-minus five hours,
37 minutes

00:05.895 --> 00:07.462
To onset of meteor shower.

00:07.513 --> 00:10.382
Okay, our position
is 34.48 degrees north,

00:10.450 --> 00:11.566
118.31 west.

00:11.634 --> 00:12.818
That means the azimuth

00:12.902 --> 00:14.135
Should be...

00:14.187 --> 00:17.439
168.22 degrees relative
to magnetic north

00:17.440 --> 00:20.058
With an elevation
of 49.93.

00:20.126 --> 00:21.410
Anything yet?

00:21.477 --> 00:25.447
Uh, we have a signal,
but there's no frame lock.

00:25.498 --> 00:27.365
Ha. How about now?
- We did it.

00:27.450 --> 00:30.819
We have the west
coast feed of HBO.

00:30.870 --> 00:33.705
<i>Ooh, Real Sex.</i>

00:33.706 --> 00:35.424
Big deal. Every time
I watch that show

00:37.794 --> 00:41.596
All right, let's see
what's on the east coast feed.

00:43.015 --> 00:44.349
<i>Oh, hey. Dune.</i>

00:46.018 --> 00:47.969
Not a great movie,

00:48.020 --> 00:49.921
But look
at that beautiful desert.

00:51.607 --> 00:54.374
Too bad Sheldon
couldn't come with us.

00:54.442 --> 00:56.459
Oh it's just not the same without him.

01:04.718 --> 01:06.669
<i>Oh, this sucks
I'm switching back to Real Sex.</i>

01:12.806 --> 01:16.525
Sheldon's log.
star date 63345.3

01:16.610 --> 01:18.394
While my colleagues are off

01:18.478 --> 01:20.195
Observing the Leonid
meteor shower,

01:20.280 --> 01:22.865
I have remained behind
to complete my paper

01:22.866 --> 01:26.166
On the decays of highly excited
massive string states.

01:26.202 --> 01:28.203
Although my research is going well

01:28.288 --> 01:31.707
I do miss the warmth of human companionship.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.878
Hahaha.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:03.995 --> 02:07.031
And good evening to you,
Siam Palace.

02:07.098 --> 02:08.666
This is Sheldon Cooper.

02:08.699 --> 02:10.101
Yeah, I'm going to be
dining alone this evening,

02:10.151 --> 02:12.603
So I'll be reducing
my usual order.

02:12.655 --> 02:15.473
I'd like to start
with one quarter

02:15.541 --> 02:17.208
Of the assorted appetizers plate

02:17.276 --> 02:21.229
And, uh, one half
of the golden treasure for two.

02:22.047 --> 02:23.197
Oh, for heaven's sake

02:23.265 --> 02:24.765
In the mid-18th century,

02:24.817 --> 02:27.652
King Rama IV of Siam
divided a huge empire

02:27.736 --> 02:29.570
Amongst the colonial powers
of Europe

02:29.621 --> 02:31.272
In order to preserve his throne.

02:31.323 --> 02:33.207
Surely, you,
his cultural descendant,

02:33.275 --> 02:35.743
Can handle pad Thai
and dumplings.

02:35.794 --> 02:37.578
Sheldon help!

02:37.629 --> 02:40.048
I need to go--
but you keep in mind

02:40.132 --> 02:41.499
That my sharply worded comments

02:41.583 --> 02:43.634
On yelp.Com recently took down
a local muffin store.

02:48.173 --> 02:50.658
Penny. Penny. Penny.

02:52.062 --> 02:53.479
Come in! Hurry!

02:55.063 --> 02:56.113
Penny?

02:56.181 --> 02:57.481
I'm back here.

03:02.153 --> 03:04.972
Penny. Penny. Penny.

03:05.023 --> 03:08.309
Oh, for god's sakes,
I'm in the bathroom!

03:08.376 --> 03:11.662
Shall I come back
at a better time?

03:11.730 --> 03:14.281
Get in here! Hurry!

03:17.282 --> 03:18.282
Don't you dare knock.

03:22.883 --> 03:23.583
Hello.

03:24.977 --> 03:25.732
I slipped in the shower,

03:25.733 --> 03:27.733
And I think I dislocated my shoulder.

03:29.168 --> 03:30.451
Not surprising.

03:30.502 --> 03:32.587
You have no safety mat
or adhesive stickers

03:32.671 --> 03:34.539
To allow for purchase on a surface

03:34.623 --> 03:37.175
With a low coefficient
of static friction.

03:37.243 --> 03:39.277
What?

03:39.345 --> 03:41.646
Tubs are slippery.

03:41.714 --> 03:43.965
I know. I slipped.

03:44.016 --> 03:46.000
I have a series
of whimsical duck stickers

03:46.051 --> 03:48.052
On the bottom of my tub.

03:48.120 --> 03:49.187
Yeah, okay, whatever.

03:49.255 --> 03:51.022
Will you just turn the water off
and help me up?

03:52.107 --> 03:54.008
They're holding
umbrellas.

03:54.059 --> 03:55.727
what?

03:55.794 --> 03:57.278
The ducks in my tub.

03:57.346 --> 03:58.646
Uh-huh.

03:58.647 --> 04:00.647
They're whimsical because ducks
have neither the need for

04:00.650 --> 04:02.735
Nor the ability to use umbrellas.

04:03.819 --> 04:06.187
Oh, my god. I got to go
to the emergency room.

04:06.238 --> 04:08.489
Well, assuming you're correct
that your right humerus

04:08.540 --> 04:10.158
Is no longer seated
in the glenoid socket,

04:10.209 --> 04:12.810
I would certainly think so.
Okay, can you drive me?

04:12.878 --> 04:14.245
I don't drive.

04:14.330 --> 04:15.396
Well, I can't drive!

04:15.464 --> 04:18.249
Well, it seems we've reached
an impasse.

04:18.334 --> 04:19.584
Ow.

04:19.668 --> 04:22.403
I could call you a cab
or an ambulance.
No, no, no.

04:22.471 --> 04:23.104
I can't wait that long.

04:23.155 --> 04:24.472
You got to help me, please.

04:25.741 --> 04:28.493
All right. Let it never be said
that Sheldon Lee Cooper

04:28.578 --> 04:30.612
Ignored the pleas
of a damsel in distress.

04:30.663 --> 04:32.430
No one's saying that.
Let's go.

04:32.498 --> 04:34.165
Well, it does seem rather ironic

04:34.250 --> 04:36.418
That for want
of 99-cent adhesive ducks,

04:36.419 --> 04:39.487
We both might die
in a fiery car crash.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.540
I wish Penny didn't for want
didn't have to work.

04:42.625 --> 04:43.675
She loves camping.

04:43.759 --> 04:45.293
Yeah, that would
have been great.

04:45.344 --> 04:46.978
You and Penny having sex
in the tent

04:47.046 --> 04:49.831
While I sit out here
and watch Howard hump a cactus.

04:51.217 --> 04:54.469
Okay, the best I can tell,

04:54.520 --> 04:56.054
There are eight other
camp-sites nearby.

04:56.138 --> 04:57.505
Mostly science nerds like us,

04:57.556 --> 05:00.642
But just over yon
ridge are two

05:00.693 --> 05:02.527
Not unattractive
middle school teachers

05:02.612 --> 05:04.362
Who reek of desperation.

05:04.397 --> 05:06.314
Wow. Wonderful.

05:08.117 --> 05:09.701
How old are they?
Oh I don't know. 50, 55.

05:11.037 --> 05:12.621
Oh, menopause.

05:13.823 --> 05:16.157
Nature's birth control.

05:16.208 --> 05:17.325
Come on.

05:17.393 --> 05:19.077
You guys can't be that hard up.

05:19.161 --> 05:21.195
I am.
Yeah, me, too.

05:24.634 --> 05:25.583
Look-- they gave me home-made cookies
of course, they did.

05:25.651 --> 05:27.252
That's what grandmothers do.

05:27.336 --> 05:28.887
So, what are we waiting for?

05:28.971 --> 05:29.988
Relax.

05:30.056 --> 05:31.806
I said we'd stop by
a little later

05:31.874 --> 05:33.925
After they have their nap.

05:34.010 --> 05:35.010
Good idea.

05:35.061 --> 05:36.177
They'll be refreshed.

05:36.228 --> 05:37.595
Cookie?

05:37.680 --> 05:39.380
Yeah. Thank you.

05:43.152 --> 05:44.402
Not bad.

05:44.437 --> 05:45.820
Yeah, very tasty.

05:45.888 --> 05:47.555
Well, so tell me more
about these teachers.

05:47.606 --> 05:48.857
Not much to tell.

05:48.908 --> 05:50.575
They had a VW Microbus

05:50.660 --> 05:53.578
And were wearing tie-dyed
Grateful Dead shirts.

05:53.663 --> 05:55.447
Huh.

05:55.531 --> 05:57.666
Mmm.

05:57.733 --> 05:59.751
Good cookies.

06:04.674 --> 06:08.576
I see no organizational
system in here whatsoever.

06:09.929 --> 06:12.263
Which panties do you
wear on Mondays?

06:12.348 --> 06:14.032
I don't need panties.

06:14.100 --> 06:15.734
I just need shorts
and a shirt.

06:15.801 --> 06:18.286
My mother always told me one
should wear clean underpants

06:18.354 --> 06:19.938
In case one is in an accident.

06:20.022 --> 06:22.057
One was already in an accident.

06:22.108 --> 06:23.725
That doesn't mean one
won't be in another,

06:23.776 --> 06:25.143
Especially if I'm driving.

06:25.227 --> 06:26.361
Clothes, Sheldon.

06:26.445 --> 06:27.729
I need clothes!
Okay.

06:27.780 --> 06:29.481
Here.

06:29.565 --> 06:31.266
Seriously?
Those shorts with that top?

06:32.952 --> 06:34.936
All right.

06:36.205 --> 06:37.822
No.

06:39.575 --> 06:41.743
No.

06:41.794 --> 06:43.495
Oh, that's cute.

06:44.714 --> 06:46.965
We should have you checked
for a concussion.

06:46.966 --> 06:48.750
okay.

06:48.801 --> 06:50.921
Now, you got to help me
put these on.

06:51.006 --> 06:52.923
All right.
But don't look.

06:53.008 --> 06:55.793
Don't look?
I don't want you
to see me naked.

06:55.877 --> 06:56.877
Oh.

06:56.928 --> 06:58.529
Well, that's understandable.

06:58.597 --> 07:02.001
You may be interested to know
that a prohibition against looking

07:02.017 --> 07:04.185
Is well established
in heroic mythology.

07:04.252 --> 07:07.371
Uh, Lot and his wife,
Perseus and Medusa,

07:07.439 --> 07:09.223
Orpheus and Eurydi...
Yeah, great.

07:09.274 --> 07:10.274
They always look.

07:10.358 --> 07:11.143
It never ends well.

07:12.227 --> 07:14.756
Ok, now you gotta help me get my arm
into the sleeve.

07:14.757 --> 07:15.757
Ok.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.408
Is that my arm?

07:24.478 --> 07:27.447
It doesn't feel
like an arm.

07:27.532 --> 07:30.350
Then, maybe you
should let it go.

07:32.203 --> 07:34.204
All righty.

07:47.022 --> 07:49.523
Stars are pretty, aren't they?

07:51.524 --> 07:53.524
Up above the world so high,

07:53.591 --> 07:57.077
Like little diamonds in the sky.

07:57.145 --> 08:00.413
That's beautiful, dude.

08:00.481 --> 08:02.115
You should...
You should write that down

08:02.200 --> 08:05.012
Before someone steals it.

08:05.080 --> 08:07.714
- So, when do the meteors get here?
- The meteors don't get here.

08:07.798 --> 08:09.766
The earth is moving
into their path.

08:09.834 --> 08:11.718
I can feel it.

08:13.921 --> 08:17.123
I can feel
the earth moving.

08:18.175 --> 08:19.392
It's moving too fast.

08:19.477 --> 08:21.144
Raj, slow it down.

08:29.987 --> 08:32.172
Okay, how's that?

08:33.222 --> 08:35.875
Better. Thanks.

08:35.943 --> 08:38.410
Stars are pretty,
aren't they?

08:42.832 --> 08:44.417
What's so funny?

08:44.485 --> 08:45.852
It's your American accent.

08:45.920 --> 08:47.420
Everything you say
sounds stupid.

08:49.957 --> 08:51.791
"stars are pretty, aren't they?"

09:00.301 --> 09:03.178
For the record, I
should let you know

09:03.245 --> 09:06.848
This is my first time driving
an actual motor vehicle.

09:08.134 --> 09:09.918
You have your
learner's permit, right?

09:09.969 --> 09:11.353
Yes, and I have logged

09:11.420 --> 09:13.922
A considerable number of hours
on a simulator.

09:13.973 --> 09:16.608
- Good.
- Didn't work out well.

09:16.642 --> 09:18.610
All right,
can we please go?
One moment.

09:18.644 --> 09:20.545
According to my driver's ed book,
a side mirror is properly adjusted

09:22.782 --> 09:25.005
When a portion of the is
driver's door handle

09:25.073 --> 09:26.640
Is visible in the
lower right corner.

09:26.675 --> 09:27.725
There's the handle.

09:27.792 --> 09:29.126
Oh, no, too far.

09:29.194 --> 09:31.845
Bringing it back.

09:31.930 --> 09:33.230
Optimized.

09:33.298 --> 09:34.932
Now, where is the switch

09:34.983 --> 09:37.067
To adjust
the passenger side mirror?

09:37.135 --> 09:38.986
It's right there.

09:40.471 --> 09:42.823
Where is the passenger
side mirror?

09:43.858 --> 09:46.026
In a parking lot in Hollywood.

09:48.335 --> 09:50.670
- Now, can we please go?
- Yes. As soon as I adjust my seat.

09:52.256 --> 09:54.006
Whee!

09:59.847 --> 10:00.963
Oh, dear.

10:01.014 --> 10:02.899
I'm going to have
start again.

10:11.608 --> 10:14.743
If I could speak
the language of rabbits,

10:14.811 --> 10:18.414
They would be amazed,
and I would be their king.

10:20.017 --> 10:21.086
I hate my name.

10:23.070 --> 10:25.488
It has "nerd" in it.

10:28.159 --> 10:31.561
Len-nerd.

10:32.829 --> 10:34.948
I lost my virginity
to my cousin Jeanie.

10:37.785 --> 10:40.053
I would be kind
to my rabbit subjects.

10:42.689 --> 10:44.990
At first.

10:45.058 --> 10:47.727
You know what's a cool name?

10:47.778 --> 10:50.246
Angelo.

10:50.313 --> 10:53.649
That has angel and jell-o in it.

10:54.851 --> 10:56.786
It was my Uncle Murray's
funeral.

10:56.853 --> 10:59.255
We were all back
at my Aunt Barbara's house.

10:59.322 --> 11:01.741
Our eyes locked
over the pickled herring.

11:01.808 --> 11:03.793
We never meant for it to happen.

11:05.295 --> 11:08.381
One day, I hold a great ball
for the President of France,

11:08.448 --> 11:10.566
But the rabbits--
they hate me and don't come.

11:10.634 --> 11:13.536
I am embarrassed, so I eat
all the lettuce in the world

11:13.603 --> 11:15.621
And make them watch.

11:16.923 --> 11:18.924
People could call me Angie.

11:21.128 --> 11:24.180
Yo, Angie, how's it goin'?

11:24.847 --> 11:30.398
To this day, I can't look at pickled herring
without being aroused. That is a shame.

11:31.617 --> 11:33.952
oh! Cousin Jeanie.

11:38.958 --> 11:41.660
Could you please drive
a little faster?

11:41.744 --> 11:44.462
Oh, I think we're going
sufficiently fast.

11:46.132 --> 11:48.083
What's that?

11:48.134 --> 11:50.001
Nothing. The engine does that
sometimes.

11:50.086 --> 11:51.169
It can't be nothing.

11:51.254 --> 11:52.337
The check engine light is on.

11:52.421 --> 11:53.755
We need
to find a service station.

11:53.806 --> 11:56.091
No. The light has been on
since I bought the car.

11:56.142 --> 11:57.475
All the more reason

11:57.510 --> 12:00.262
To consult with a mechanic
before it explodes.

12:00.313 --> 12:01.563
It's not going to explode.

12:01.630 --> 12:02.848
Just keep driving.

12:02.932 --> 12:06.101
Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock.

12:06.152 --> 12:10.188
<i>Mr. Spock did not pilot
the Enterprise.</i>

12:10.273 --> 12:12.941
He was the science officer,
and I guarantee you that

12:12.992 --> 12:15.527
<i>If he ever saw the Enterprise's
check engine light blinking,</i>

12:15.611 --> 12:18.330
He would pull the ship over
immediately.

12:18.414 --> 12:21.783
Oh, god, I'm gonna lose the arm.

12:21.834 --> 12:22.984
Oh, oh, red light.

12:23.035 --> 12:25.153
Release accelerator

12:25.204 --> 12:29.291
And slowly apply...
the... brake.

12:31.794 --> 12:33.879
Nailed it.

12:36.766 --> 12:39.968
While we have a moment,
may I ask you a question?

12:40.019 --> 12:41.353
What?

12:41.437 --> 12:43.722
Why do you have the
Chinese character for soup

12:43.806 --> 12:45.840
Tattooed on your
right buttock?

12:45.908 --> 12:47.609
It's not soup.

12:47.610 --> 12:48.843
It's courage.

12:48.895 --> 12:50.295
No, it isn't.

12:50.363 --> 12:52.530
But I suppose
it does take courage

12:52.615 --> 12:56.368
To demonstrate that kind
of commitment to soup.

12:56.435 --> 12:58.320
How did you see it?

12:58.371 --> 12:59.821
You said you wouldn't look.

12:59.872 --> 13:01.022
Sorry.

13:01.073 --> 13:04.276
As I told you, the
hero always peeks.

13:13.302 --> 13:14.452
Anything?

13:14.520 --> 13:17.038
No. That was the last
pudding cup.

13:17.089 --> 13:19.207
No!

13:19.258 --> 13:21.509
What about Slim Jim's?

13:25.147 --> 13:29.384
That's what he used to eat his pudding, remember?
Right! That was so good!

13:29.435 --> 13:33.388
Sweety and meaty
at the same time.

13:33.439 --> 13:35.690
Wait. Wait, wait.
So you're saying

13:35.741 --> 13:37.075
We're out of food?

13:37.159 --> 13:39.727
The only thing in here
are blue ice packs.

13:39.779 --> 13:41.830
I know they're poison,

13:41.897 --> 13:45.750
But they look like big,
yummy otter pops.

13:47.036 --> 13:48.903
Oh, god, I am so hungry.

13:48.955 --> 13:50.105
Me, too.

13:50.172 --> 13:53.675
Check and see
if we have any more pudding.

14:00.283 --> 14:02.634
All right, there's no need
to bark at me.

14:04.437 --> 14:06.754
According to the inexplicably
irritable nurse behind the desk,

14:06.806 --> 14:08.306
You'll be seen after the man

14:08.391 --> 14:10.408
who claims
to be having a heart attack,

14:10.476 --> 14:11.977
But appears to be well enough

14:12.061 --> 14:14.796
To play Doodle Jump
on his iphone.

14:14.864 --> 14:17.649
We have to fill these out.

14:18.985 --> 14:20.902
"describe illness or injury."

14:20.953 --> 14:23.438
I dislocated
my shoulder.

14:23.489 --> 14:25.173
All right.

14:25.241 --> 14:27.926
And how did the accident occur?

14:27.994 --> 14:30.412
You ready know that.

14:30.479 --> 14:32.464
"cause of accident."

14:32.548 --> 14:34.632
"lack of adhesive ducks."

14:36.652 --> 14:39.421
Okay, medical history.

14:39.472 --> 14:41.423
"Have you ever been diagnosed
with diabetes?"

14:41.490 --> 14:43.024
No.
Kidney disease?

14:43.092 --> 14:44.759
No.
Migraines?

14:44.810 --> 14:46.811
Getting one.

14:47.813 --> 14:49.431
"Are you currently
pregnant?"
no.

14:49.482 --> 14:50.598
Are you sure?

14:50.649 --> 14:51.883
You look a bit puffy.

14:54.020 --> 14:56.137
Change migraine to yes.

14:57.406 --> 14:59.357
"When was your last
menstrual period?"

14:59.442 --> 15:00.992
Oh. Next question.

15:01.077 --> 15:03.144
I'll put, "in progress."

15:05.081 --> 15:07.532
Okay, moving
to psychiatric disorders.

15:07.616 --> 15:09.367
"list all major
behavioural diagnoses,

15:09.452 --> 15:11.436
"e.g. Depression,
anxiety, etcetera."

15:11.504 --> 15:13.872
Oh, my god, what the
hell does this have

15:13.956 --> 15:15.357
to do with my
stupid shoulder?!

15:15.424 --> 15:18.659
"episodes of sub psychotic
rage."

15:20.196 --> 15:21.596
Ass.

15:21.680 --> 15:23.681
"possible tourette's."

15:25.017 --> 15:29.270
All right. "moles, lesions
or other skin conditions."

15:29.338 --> 15:31.856
"soup tattoo on right buttock."

15:31.941 --> 15:33.274
Hey, Sheldon,
Sheldon, look,

15:33.342 --> 15:35.643
I am scared and
in a lot of pain.

15:36.714 --> 15:40.565
Could you please just take a
break from being you and try being--

15:40.649 --> 15:43.485
I don't know--
comforting?

15:43.552 --> 15:46.337
I'm sorry.

15:47.373 --> 15:49.524
There, there.

15:50.793 --> 15:52.794
Every thing's going
to be fine.

16:00.886 --> 16:02.887
Sheldon's here.

16:09.395 --> 16:11.146
Thanks.

16:11.213 --> 16:13.565
That's much better.

16:14.950 --> 16:17.202
Oh, I'm so hungry!

16:17.269 --> 16:18.686
Will you shut up?

16:18.754 --> 16:20.888
We're all hungry.

16:20.940 --> 16:22.723
Okay, our objective is

16:22.775 --> 16:24.576
The boy scout
camp-site to the east.

16:24.660 --> 16:25.944
Easy target.

16:26.028 --> 16:29.063
Big doughy scout master,
couple of cubs, most webelos.

16:29.115 --> 16:30.415
What kind of score
we looking at?

16:30.499 --> 16:31.583
Hot dogs, buns, s'mores.

16:31.667 --> 16:33.168
I mean, it's a freaking 7-11.

16:33.235 --> 16:34.335
All right,

16:34.403 --> 16:36.421
Everyone grab flash lights.

16:39.241 --> 16:41.543
Oh, my god, could it be?

16:41.594 --> 16:42.844
Yes!

16:42.911 --> 16:45.763
My mother put an "I love you"
brisket in my backpack.

16:45.798 --> 16:46.747
Quick, get forks.

16:46.799 --> 16:48.133
You don't need forks.

16:48.217 --> 16:49.917
It's so tender,
it falls apart in your hands.

16:49.969 --> 16:51.970
He's right.

17:00.713 --> 17:02.897
I feel like we're forgetting
something important.

17:02.948 --> 17:04.949
Me, too.
But what?

17:07.153 --> 17:11.955
Maybe a Tupperware bowl
of roasted potatoes and carrots?

17:12.040 --> 17:13.992
Yes!
Yes!

17:17.997 --> 17:22.333
Now remember, you were given
powerful pain medication

17:22.417 --> 17:24.051
And a muscle relaxer,

17:24.118 --> 17:26.721
So, uh, don't operate
heavy machinery.

17:29.175 --> 17:31.342
Try not to choke
on your own drool.

17:32.794 --> 17:34.128
Wait. You have

17:34.180 --> 17:35.963
To help me get into bed.

17:39.018 --> 17:42.437
Sheldon has to get me into bed.

17:43.572 --> 17:47.141
Bet you never thought
I'd say that.

17:47.193 --> 17:49.194
Yes.

17:50.496 --> 17:53.481
The charm of your drug addled
candour knows no bounds.

17:55.117 --> 17:59.621
You know, people think
you're this weird robot man

17:59.672 --> 18:03.091
Who's so annoying all the time,
and you totally are.

18:03.158 --> 18:07.545
<i>But then it's like that movie
Wall-e at the end.</i>

18:07.630 --> 18:09.631
You're so full of love,

18:09.682 --> 18:11.999
And you can save a plant

18:12.051 --> 18:15.737
And get fat people
out of the floaty chairs.

18:16.514 --> 18:20.892
That's a fairly laboured metaphor,
but I appreciate the sentiment behind it.

18:20.976 --> 18:24.145
Sing "Soft Kitty" to me.

18:27.950 --> 18:29.784
"Soft Kitty" is for
when you're sick.

18:29.868 --> 18:31.018
You're not sick.

18:31.070 --> 18:34.322
Injured and drugged
is a kind of sick.

18:43.666 --> 18:49.587
soft kitty, warm kitty,
little ball of fur...

18:49.655 --> 18:50.888
Wait, wait.

18:50.973 --> 18:52.974
Let's sing it as a round.

18:53.041 --> 18:54.309
I'll start.

18:55.894 --> 19:03.117
soft kitty, warm kitty,
little ball of fur...

19:05.521 --> 19:07.855
I'll start over.

19:09.533 --> 19:14.051
soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur

19:20.119 --> 19:24.455
Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur.

19:24.523 --> 19:27.809
soft kitty, warm kitty,
little ball of fur... 

19:27.876 --> 19:29.994
happy kitty,
sleepy kitty 

19:29.995 --> 19:32.297
happy kitty,
sleepy kitty

19:32.381 --> 19:34.215
happy kitty,
purr, purr, purr

19:34.266 --> 19:38.486
purr, purr, purr. 

19:44.092 --> 19:47.294
...And the next morning
when he woke up,

19:47.345 --> 19:50.664
He rolled over and realized...

19:50.715 --> 19:52.800
duh-duh-duh! 

19:54.286 --> 19:56.270
...She was his cousin.

20:02.894 --> 20:05.763
That's still not funny.

20:07.115 --> 20:09.033
That's still not funny.

20:10.569 --> 20:13.520
And she was my second cousin.

20:13.588 --> 20:15.155
And she was my
second cousin.

20:18.994 --> 20:20.711
You're a real douche.

20:20.795 --> 20:23.213
Who cares?
You slept with your cousin.

20:23.248 --> 20:29.717
