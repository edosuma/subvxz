WEBVTT

00:07.800 --> 00:09.100
So just remember,

00:09.100 --> 00:11.400
when you're standing there
out on the...

00:11.600 --> 00:13.600
Why hasn't Frasier
mentioned the Spokane thing yet?

00:13.900 --> 00:16.300
I don't know. I'm sure we'll get to it
by the end of the show.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.100
Well, he better. Because I left him
a memo and an e-mail

00:19.400 --> 00:22.100
specifically asking him
to promote this Spokane thing.

00:22.400 --> 00:25.900
Now, ignoring an e-mail's one thing,
but a memo and an e-mail?

00:26.100 --> 00:29.800
I may have to bring the hammer down
and leave a Post-it on his desk.

00:30.500 --> 00:33.200
Which brings me to a bit of news.

00:33.500 --> 00:37.000
Monday, there will be a new addition
to the Frasier Crane radio family.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.400
The city of Spokane.

00:39.700 --> 00:41.300
Ooh, thank goodness.

00:41.600 --> 00:45.000
Man, that was like the Cuban Missile
Crisis for a moment, wasn't it?

00:45.700 --> 00:48.800
In fact, KQZY is not only
going to be carrying the show,

00:49.100 --> 00:51.900
but they've invited Roz and me
to conduct Monday's broadcast

00:52.100 --> 00:54.300
from their studios in Spokane.

00:54.600 --> 00:57.000
But fret not, Seattle.

00:57.300 --> 00:59.800
Although my body
will be 300 miles away,

01:00.200 --> 01:04.900
my heart will be firmly lodged
in your radios.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.100
You know, that sounded a lot better
this morning in the shower.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.700
Anyway, good day
and good mental health.

01:12.300 --> 01:16.000
- I thought Friday was your bath day.
- Well, I woke up late.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.300
What time do you want me
to pick up you and Roger?

01:18.600 --> 01:21.700
Ooh, there's been a change in plans.
Roger is not coming to Spokane.

01:22.100 --> 01:24.200
Really? Well, nothing wrong,
I hope.

01:24.400 --> 01:26.100
We broke up.

01:26.300 --> 01:28.900
Oh, Roz, I'm so sorry.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.200
We talked about some problems
we'd been having

01:31.500 --> 01:33.700
and decided, you know,
we'd be better off apart.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.400
- When did this happen?
- Last week.

01:35.700 --> 01:37.000
- Last week?
- I didn't tell you,

01:37.200 --> 01:40.100
because I didn't want to have
a long conversation.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.300
I understand.

01:43.600 --> 01:46.200
You must be going through a lot.
Back in private practise,

01:46.400 --> 01:49.900
- I used to tell my Grief group that...
- See, this is exactly what I mean.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.700
I appreciate your concern,
but I am fine.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.100
Really.

01:55.300 --> 01:56.500
Okay.

01:57.800 --> 02:00.000
Boy, what a surprise.

02:00.300 --> 02:01.900
- No more Roger.
- I know.

02:02.200 --> 02:05.700
Yes. He had a rare kind of dignity

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
and integrity you don't see much of
nowadays.

02:09.300 --> 02:11.700
Especially among people
who own a bench press.

02:12.400 --> 02:16.800
I don't believe I've ever met anyone
with that combination of gentility

02:17.200 --> 02:18.400
and brute strength.

02:18.700 --> 02:19.700
Well, not anybody single.

02:19.900 --> 02:20.900
[LAUGHS]

02:21.700 --> 02:23.900
- I'm not helping, am I?
- No.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.900
Niles, I thought you and Daphne
were going out tonight.

02:33.200 --> 02:36.100
She's still getting ready. Hey, Frasier,
am I dressed appropriately

02:36.400 --> 02:39.000
for something called Bananarama?

02:40.500 --> 02:42.700
You're in Armani.
Who could object?

02:44.700 --> 02:45.700
- Hey, guys.
FRASIER: Dad.

02:45.900 --> 02:48.100
Uh, just lean it up
against the window there, will you?

02:48.400 --> 02:50.400
- What is this?
- It's mahogany.

02:50.600 --> 02:54.300
Real straight grain too. I found it
outside the construction site next door.

02:54.700 --> 02:56.200
They were gonna throw it away.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.000
Dad, I thought
we had this discussion

02:58.200 --> 03:01.600
when you found that mattress
on the side of the highway.

03:01.900 --> 03:04.900
But this isn't for resale.
I'm gonna make a TV table out of it.

03:05.300 --> 03:07.600
Thanks, fellas. Isn't it a beaut?

03:07.900 --> 03:10.100
There's a ketchup packet stuck to it.

03:11.400 --> 03:15.000
Oh, it's gonna feel good
to break out the tools,

03:15.400 --> 03:17.100
roll up my sleeves

03:17.300 --> 03:19.000
and make something
with my own two hands.

03:19.100 --> 03:20.400
FRASIER:
Are you sure this is a good idea?

03:20.700 --> 03:22.600
Woodworking has never really been
your strength.

03:22.900 --> 03:25.100
Yeah. I think the scariest words
of my childhood were:

03:25.400 --> 03:27.800
"Your father needs your help
down in the basement."

03:29.500 --> 03:32.400
I must have done something right.
I made a lot of good stuff.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.800
Even with directions,
you could never assemble anything.

03:35.100 --> 03:40.500
I remember a playset where the slide
ended right in front of the swings.

03:42.300 --> 03:45.800
- I don't remember that.
- I know. Sorry.

03:47.400 --> 03:51.200
Now, I'm gonna build a TV table,
and I need a number one helper.

03:51.500 --> 03:54.100
- Whose turn is it?
- No, no. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.200
I am leaving for Spokane on Sunday.
I will not be available.

03:57.600 --> 04:00.400
- Your show's not till Monday.
- Yes, well, I have sponsors to meet.

04:00.700 --> 04:03.400
I have press interviews
and photo sessions.

04:03.700 --> 04:05.600
Niles, this is a very big step
in my career.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.900
If I can prove that my brand of radio
travels well,

04:08.200 --> 04:12.200
perhaps I can parlay Spokane
into Denver, Chicago.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.800
Maybe even New York City.

04:15.100 --> 04:17.899
- Well, you win, buddy.
- Oh.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.800
I'll see you tomorrow.

04:20.100 --> 04:23.300
Be sure to wear some work gloves.
Oh, and some coveralls.

04:23.700 --> 04:27.800
We don't want a repeat of that
necktie-in-the-bandsaw incident.

04:29.100 --> 04:30.700
Oh, great. With my luck,

04:31.000 --> 04:33.800
there'll be a baseball game
on the radio too.

04:34.100 --> 04:35.500
It won't be so bad.

04:36.100 --> 04:37.100
How can you say that?

04:37.200 --> 04:40.200
You once tried to report him
to the Child Labor Board.

04:40.600 --> 04:44.300
I was being proactive. You used to
lock yourself in the bathroom to cry.

04:45.100 --> 04:48.600
I didn't go in there to cry.
I went in to regather my patience.

04:50.500 --> 04:53.200
Say, Niles, why don't you ask Daphne
to fill in for you?

04:53.500 --> 04:54.800
- Daphne?
- Well, why not?

04:55.100 --> 04:58.000
She's gonna owe you big-time
after this banana event.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.600
No, no, it's a concert.
And I hardly think it compares

05:00.800 --> 05:02.800
to the torture of assisting Dad.

05:03.900 --> 05:06.200
All right, I'm ready.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.700
Oh, Niles, you're not going
in those clothes.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.400
Come with me. I got you some hair gel
and parachute pants.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.800
HERM:
Okay, here's the drill.

05:23.100 --> 05:24.800
I'll introduce you to the reporters,

05:25.100 --> 05:27.500
they'll ask you questions,
try not to go on too much.

05:27.800 --> 05:30.300
The faster we get them
to the courtesy liquor, the better.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.100
Oh, don't worry, Herm.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.800
I'll get my message across.
You see, I'm a bit of a puppeteer

05:35.100 --> 05:36.400
when it comes to the press.

05:36.700 --> 05:38.100
Good.

05:38.300 --> 05:40.400
But still, liquor.

05:42.600 --> 05:43.700
Oh, sorry I'm late, doc.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.900
I, uh, had a situation at the hotel,

05:46.100 --> 05:47.300
but it's under control now.

05:47.400 --> 05:51.300
Judging from the pillow wrinkles
on your cheek, it was a nap situation.

05:52.500 --> 05:54.900
- Point is, it's under control.
- Ah.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.800
Kenny Daly.
Don't say hi or anything?

05:58.200 --> 05:59.800
Herm Evans.

06:00.100 --> 06:01.800
So how's our star doing?

06:02.000 --> 06:03.900
- Everything go okay with the CPSs?
- Terrific.

06:04.200 --> 06:06.000
- And your ExecComm?
- Oh, they're thrilled.

06:06.200 --> 06:09.000
- What about the M&M's?
- Help yourself.

06:11.100 --> 06:12.800
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey, Roz.

06:13.100 --> 06:15.400
Let me introduce you to Herm Evans,
the station manager.

06:15.700 --> 06:17.100
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you, Roz.

06:17.300 --> 06:18.900
- Thank you.
- Now that everybody's here,

06:19.200 --> 06:21.600
- I'll go get the reporters.
- Right, right.

06:21.900 --> 06:24.700
Uh, Roz, listen,
sure you're up to this?

06:24.900 --> 06:26.300
Yeah, why? Why wouldn't I be?

06:26.500 --> 06:29.700
Well, it's been a tough time lately,
you know, with the Roger situation.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.100
Oh, knock it off, Frasier, I'm fine.

06:32.400 --> 06:33.400
- You're sure?
- Yes.

06:33.700 --> 06:35.400
I wouldn't blame you
if you were struggling.

06:35.600 --> 06:38.400
I mean, my head would be filled
with "what if"s and "if only"s and...

06:38.700 --> 06:40.500
Oh, God forbid,
the looming question:

06:40.800 --> 06:42.400
"What if I'll never again
have a chance...?"

06:42.700 --> 06:45.000
Ooh, here comes the press.
All right, big smiles.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.300
HERM:
Thanks for coming, everybody.

06:47.800 --> 06:51.500
Hey, Matt, is that a new tie
or did you just have it cleaned?

06:51.800 --> 06:52.700
[BOTH LAUGH]

06:54.300 --> 06:56.200
There'll be plenty of time
for that cheese plate

06:56.500 --> 07:00.800
after you've fallen in love
with KQZY's proud new addition,

07:01.200 --> 07:03.800
- Dr. Frasier Crane.
- Thank you.

07:04.200 --> 07:05.400
Thank you very much.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.500
I'd like to take this opportunity
to introduce

07:07.800 --> 07:11.200
my lovely producing partner,
Roz Doyle.

07:11.600 --> 07:16.000
I'm looking forward to becoming part
of the radio landscape in Spokane.

07:16.400 --> 07:17.600
Dr. Crane, how do you feel

07:17.800 --> 07:20.400
about taking over
Neal Sullivan's time slot?

07:20.700 --> 07:21.900
- I'm sorry, who?
HERM: Nobody.

07:22.100 --> 07:23.300
It's a guy you're replacing.

07:23.600 --> 07:26.900
Nobody? He's been
a Spokane institution for 30 years.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.100
HERM:
Yes, we all saw your column.

07:29.300 --> 07:31.200
You know what would make
another great column?

07:31.400 --> 07:36.500
Dr. Crane went to Harvard and Oxford.
Wow.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.400
No offence, Dr. Crane, your degrees
aren't going to make us forget Sully.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.300
And I don't intend that they should.

07:43.500 --> 07:44.900
I don't want you to forget anyone.

07:45.100 --> 07:47.400
- I'm here to help people.
CATHY: Sully helps people.

07:47.700 --> 07:50.300
Every Fourth of July, he organizes
a group of troubled teens

07:50.600 --> 07:52.400
and cleans up all the trash
on the riverbanks.

07:52.700 --> 07:54.700
Will we be seeing you
on the Fourth of July?

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Hey, what's this over here?

07:57.300 --> 07:59.100
Free liquor?

- Hey, guys.

08:02.700 --> 08:04.300
Don't let me interrupt.

I, uh, just clearing out a few things
from my desk.

08:06.900 --> 08:10.500
Just wanted to stop by
and wish my successor luck.

08:10.800 --> 08:13.500
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much,
Mr. Sullivan.

08:13.700 --> 08:16.400
As someone who has served Spokane,
your blessing is appreciated.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.800
You don't need my blessing.
I'm just a simple man

08:19.100 --> 08:21.600
with a passion for Spokane
in his heart

08:22.000 --> 08:25.200
and a termination notice
in his pocket. Heh.

08:25.500 --> 08:28.100
Sully, will you be listening
to Dr. Crane's show tomorrow?

08:28.400 --> 08:30.400
Not sure, Cathy.
I've been going around on that one

08:30.700 --> 08:33.400
like the horses on the Looff.

08:33.799 --> 08:35.299

08:35.500 --> 08:36.799
I'm sorry, the Looff?

08:37.000 --> 08:38.600
- It's a carousel.
- Oh.

08:38.900 --> 08:43.000
I guess you have to be in the city more
than three hours to know that. Ha-ha.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.800
Sully, what are you going to do
with your time now?

08:47.000 --> 08:48.800
Good question, Frank.

08:49.100 --> 08:51.500
When my dad retired,
he died a month later.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.900
Take that any way you like.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.800
But, uh, you know what, fellas?

08:58.000 --> 09:00.700
You really should be asking Dr. Crane
the questions.

09:00.900 --> 09:03.500
If anyone needs me,
I'll be down the street at Mulligan's,

09:03.800 --> 09:04.800
buying rounds.

09:05.100 --> 09:08.000
- Keep smiling.

- Where's the chuck key?
- The what?

You know, that thing there.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.600
The tightener.

- It's called the chuck key.
- Well, maybe in England.

09:41.300 --> 09:44.600
Here in the U.S.,
it doesn't have a specific name.

- Oh, damn.

I forgot to pick them up
at the hardware store.

No, that's all right. I'll get them.

- You get started gluing the footpads.
- All right.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.300
Look, I'm so sorry for roping you
into this.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.100
Oh, don't be.

10:33.300 --> 10:36.800
It reminds me of when I used to mess
about in the garage with my brothers.

10:37.100 --> 10:38.800
We used to build all sorts of things.

10:39.100 --> 10:42.200
Splints, crutches, peg legs.

10:43.800 --> 10:46.800
Still, you're sweet to help Dad.
I don't think I could take his bossiness.

10:47.100 --> 10:49.000
- Oh, he's not so bad.
- Hmm.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.600
Could you hand me a rag?

10:50.900 --> 10:52.900
Uh, sure.

10:53.700 --> 10:57.100
Any interest in sneaking off to your
room while the foreman's away?

10:57.700 --> 10:59.200
That sounds lovely.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.500
But first I have to get these pads on.

11:01.700 --> 11:04.700
- Can you press on this for a moment?
- Yeah, no problem.

11:05.100 --> 11:08.100
Maybe later we'll try out my
<i>Wagner for Lovers</i> CD.

11:11.100 --> 11:14.200
- I need another rag.
- Oh, uh, coming up.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.000
Can you grab me
some sandpaper too?

11:16.200 --> 11:18.500
Oh, uh, yeah, sure. Of course.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.800
Don't press too tight,
or the pad will slide.

11:22.100 --> 11:25.600
- Here, careful. Even pressure, like this.
- Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

11:25.900 --> 11:29.200
Yeah? Well, then, why is glue
squirting out?

11:29.600 --> 11:31.300
- I need the rag.
- Oh, okay.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.100
I never said I was good at carpentry.

11:33.300 --> 11:36.700
Carpentry? This is gluing felt. Ha.

11:38.900 --> 11:40.700
Can you hand me the square?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.500
No, no, no. That one.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.700
Why is the pad hanging off the side?

11:46.900 --> 11:49.400
Well, I think that it slipped
when I was handing you the rags

11:49.600 --> 11:52.600
and the sandpaper and the square,
and by the way, you're welcome.

11:52.900 --> 11:55.300
By the way, still waiting
for that sandpaper.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.800
Okay, let's stop. Ahem.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
[SIGHS]

12:02.600 --> 12:04.600
This is as bad as working with Dad.

12:04.900 --> 12:07.200
Look, Niles, I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

12:07.400 --> 12:10.700
I'm just trying to get this done
and get it done well.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.300
Okay?

12:12.900 --> 12:14.200
Okay.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.200
I love you.

12:16.700 --> 12:17.900
I love you too.

12:18.300 --> 12:22.100
And yet I'm still waiting
for that sandpaper.

12:26.800 --> 12:30.100
You know, this layout doesn't allow us
to do any call screening.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.500
But I guess you can still just check
the sound levels.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.600
Oh, boy, the sound levels?

12:36.200 --> 12:39.100
"Dear Diary, after years and years
of wishing..."

12:39.300 --> 12:41.600
Yes, all right, Roz.

12:41.900 --> 12:44.100
- Hey, doc, everything all right here?
- Yeah, it's fine.

12:44.500 --> 12:47.100
Guess who gets to check
the sound levels.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.100
Roz, I said, all right.

12:49.400 --> 12:53.000
I wanted to make sure you're relaxed,
ready, and haven't read today's paper.

12:53.300 --> 12:54.700
FRASIER:
I read it.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.400
Everything from the salute to Sully

12:56.700 --> 13:00.300
to the cartoon of me and Satan
doing a jig on Sully's coffin.

13:00.600 --> 13:03.000
About that. It might be a good idea
to steer clear

13:03.400 --> 13:05.100
of any on-air references to Sully.

13:05.300 --> 13:09.000
On the contrary, I intend
to confront this situation head-on.

13:09.300 --> 13:11.100
I intend to reach out to the listeners,

13:11.400 --> 13:14.900
ease their suffering,
and demonstrate what we do best.

13:15.300 --> 13:18.500
Now, that's the kind of attitude
this station needs.

13:18.800 --> 13:21.300
Of course, if your ratings are low,
I still have to fire you.

13:21.500 --> 13:22.900
[LAUGHS]

13:25.000 --> 13:27.300
What a crazy business, huh?
Ha-ha-ha.

13:27.900 --> 13:29.200
Ten seconds.

13:29.500 --> 13:30.800
- Knock them dead.
- Right.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.900
[WHISPERS]
Good luck.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.300
Hello and welcome.

13:35.600 --> 13:38.200
From Seattle to Spokane,

13:38.400 --> 13:43.000
this is the
Frasier Crane Radio Network.

13:43.900 --> 13:46.300
We are broadcasting today
from the Lilac City,

13:46.600 --> 13:50.600
where we have just replaced
a beloved local icon, Neal Sullivan.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.500
Now, Sully did a lot for this city,

13:53.800 --> 13:55.200
and in my own way,

13:55.400 --> 13:59.600
I hope to make the same
kind of contribution that he did.

13:59.900 --> 14:02.800
With that in mind,
let's go to the phones.

14:07.700 --> 14:09.700
Go ahead, caller, I'm listening.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.500
MAN [OVER RADIO]:
<i>Go back to Seattle.</i>

14:11.700 --> 14:12.700
[DIAL TONE]

14:15.900 --> 14:18.400
How was the level on that?

14:22.400 --> 14:25.200
Now, now, people, I understand
how you might be angry.

14:25.500 --> 14:27.100
There's nothing wrong with venting,

14:27.400 --> 14:30.900
but please stay on the line
long enough for me to respond.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.400
Go ahead, I'm listening.

14:33.700 --> 14:36.100

14:40.500 --> 14:43.800
Now, people, please. We need to talk.
We need to move forward.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.300
Otherwise, we're just gonna be
going around and around

14:46.600 --> 14:50.600
like the horses on the Looff.
Ha-ha-ha.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
[DIAL TONE]

14:55.000 --> 14:59.100
All right, well, you know,
perhaps our callers from Seattle

14:59.500 --> 15:02.700
could help show the new folks
how it's done.

15:04.400 --> 15:07.000
I'm afraid we don't have any calls
from Seattle.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.900
This is strange. Um...

15:09.200 --> 15:11.400
Perhaps this would be a good time
to go to a commercial

15:11.700 --> 15:15.200
here on the Frasier Crane
Radio Network.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.600
Hey, hey, you're doing great.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.200
I am not. They hate me.

15:20.300 --> 15:23.300
Okay, uh,
since we're being straight, um,

15:23.600 --> 15:25.900
Herm doesn't think it's going
very well.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.700
Yes, well, where's my support?

15:28.000 --> 15:29.400
Where are the callers from Seattle?

15:29.500 --> 15:31.000
Seattle isn't getting the signal.

15:31.300 --> 15:33.600
Something's obviously screwed up
at KACL.

15:33.900 --> 15:37.300
Oh, it's not KACL. It's that transmitter
you bought off the Ukrainian Internet.

15:37.700 --> 15:39.400
Hey, 20 minutes ago,
you were impressed

15:39.700 --> 15:41.700
with that Ukrainian Internet.

15:44.700 --> 15:46.600
I'm sure the people of Spokane
would get onboard

15:46.900 --> 15:50.500
if they could get some understanding
of what we actually do.

15:51.300 --> 15:53.600
We could use an example.

15:53.900 --> 15:55.700
Like a sample call.

15:55.900 --> 15:58.700
- Are you asking me to call in?
- Roz, please?

15:58.900 --> 16:00.600
Tell you what. Make up something.
Anything.

16:00.900 --> 16:02.300
Okay.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.300
Five seconds.

16:04.600 --> 16:06.500
Hello, and welcome back
to the <i>Frasier Crane Show.</i>

16:06.700 --> 16:09.700
We are broadcasting today
from KQZY

16:10.100 --> 16:11.900
in beautiful Spokane.

16:12.300 --> 16:14.600
Let's go to the phones.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.400
Hello, caller. I'm listening.

16:17.600 --> 16:18.800
Hi, Dr. Crane.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.700
My name is Roberta,

16:22.300 --> 16:26.300
and, um, I'm afraid of the dark.

16:32.200 --> 16:35.200
What is it about the dark
that frightens you?

16:35.900 --> 16:37.500
Um...

16:38.900 --> 16:40.500
I don't really know.

16:43.900 --> 16:46.100
I see. All right, well, uh, let's explore.

16:48.300 --> 16:51.100
Often, a fear of darkness is

16:52.100 --> 16:53.900
a fear of the unknown.

16:54.200 --> 16:58.700
It is in darkness
when our imaginations give shape

16:59.100 --> 17:01.900
to our deepest anxieties.

17:02.900 --> 17:05.200
What image comes to mind for you?

17:07.700 --> 17:09.300
Nothing, actually.

17:09.599 --> 17:11.200
Nothing?

17:11.800 --> 17:14.700
Yeah. When everything disappears,

17:15.000 --> 17:16.599
there's nothing.

17:16.900 --> 17:19.200
Just emptiness.

17:19.500 --> 17:20.900
I see.

17:21.200 --> 17:24.599
And what is it about the emptiness
that frightens you?

17:26.700 --> 17:28.200
It's...

17:29.000 --> 17:31.400
...lonely, for one thing.

17:31.900 --> 17:33.500
Have you always felt this way?

17:34.000 --> 17:35.800
For a while, I didn't.

17:36.100 --> 17:37.700
What was different then?

17:40.000 --> 17:42.200
I had somebody.

17:43.900 --> 17:46.100
A guy I really liked.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.000
And then we broke up.

17:49.400 --> 17:50.600
[SOBBING]

17:50.800 --> 17:54.800
God, Frasier, I miss him so much.

17:57.200 --> 18:00.300
I don't know how I fell in love again.

18:00.600 --> 18:02.700
I mean, I swore I wouldn't.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
I knew better.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.700
I should have known better.

18:07.300 --> 18:08.900
And then, sure enough,

18:09.100 --> 18:13.000
six months in, he tells me
there's no fireworks.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.900
And what am I supposed to say?

18:19.800 --> 18:21.900
I'm so sorry.

18:22.300 --> 18:24.300
But listen to me.

18:25.100 --> 18:28.700
You can't blame yourself
for letting someone into your heart.

18:30.300 --> 18:33.100
Love is always a risk.

18:33.500 --> 18:35.100
But you have to take it.

18:36.200 --> 18:39.300
The pain you're feeling now
will pass in time,

18:39.700 --> 18:43.100
and you'll find yourself ready
to take that risk again.

18:44.600 --> 18:46.400
Until then,

18:46.800 --> 18:49.100
take comfort in your friends.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.400
They want to help you.
