WEBVTT

00:18.226 --> 00:23.648
It's a convoy of federal police

00:24.399 --> 00:29.112
and they are coming out
of a private airport towards the jail

00:29.446 --> 00:32.907
to extract the drug lord
Joaquin Guzman Loera

00:33.700 --> 00:37.078
and bring him back to the airport,

00:37.704 --> 00:41.416
where a plane of the Mexican Air Force
is already waiting for him.

00:43.251 --> 00:47.213
Every criminal is afraid
of being extradited.

00:50.049 --> 00:54.262
El Chapo Guzman's defense team tried to
prevent him from being extradited.

00:54.596 --> 00:59.893
They mentioned how opposed he was to it,
just like anyone would be.

01:07.525 --> 01:11.529
There he is, El Chapo Guzman,
escorted by members of the DEA.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.783
We just saw him going into a hangar.

01:15.116 --> 01:20.705
El Chapo Guzman steps into the USA
at exactly 9:32 p.m.

01:21.372 --> 01:24.167
A new story of El Chapo Guzman
is about to begin.

01:27.045 --> 01:29.798
METROPOLITAN CORRECTIONAL CENTER
NEW YORK, USA

01:51.236 --> 01:52.987
I could have prevented the extradition.

02:03.873 --> 02:07.836
I feel the warmth
from my boiling blood

02:08.419 --> 02:12.549
I feel the fear sweat dripping away

02:12.674 --> 02:16.636
There's a stillness
that nothing transmits

02:17.303 --> 02:23.309
I'm a breeze that grows stronger

02:23.393 --> 02:26.521
Even when the clouds drift away

02:27.605 --> 02:31.234
Even when my skin dries away

02:31.985 --> 02:35.530
I'll be back someday

02:36.531 --> 02:40.660
To unleash my return

02:45.206 --> 02:49.127
I have the dust that protects the road

02:49.377 --> 02:53.506
I have the branches of a leafless tree

02:54.215 --> 02:58.177
I'm the guardian of the tired night

02:58.386 --> 03:04.434
There are silhouettes that
come to meet me

03:05.059 --> 03:09.314
Even when the clouds drift away

03:09.397 --> 03:12.358
Even when my skin dries away

03:13.401 --> 03:17.071
I'll be back someday

03:18.197 --> 03:22.076
To unleash my return

03:28.374 --> 03:31.878
8 YEARS EARLIER

03:36.799 --> 03:39.219

GOMEZ TWINS
OPERATORS FOR JOAQUIN IN CHICAGO

06:29.305 --> 06:31.099
The cargo arrived without any problems.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.185
We're preparing it to send to New York.

06:34.268 --> 06:35.103
WAREHOUSE

06:35.186 --> 06:36.062
That's great.

06:36.562 --> 06:37.688
Let me know when it arrives.

07:09.679 --> 07:10.972
The twins got in touch.

07:11.556 --> 07:12.598
The heroin got there OK.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.811
Send half the money to the money exchange
houses on Juarez Street.

07:17.812 --> 07:20.189
Share the rest with the soldiers
in that area.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.024
We're doing great, Joaquin.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.819
The profits are so high
that we no longer count the money,

07:25.153 --> 07:26.487
we just weigh it.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.531
That's because we're controlling
the border.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.783
Now with Mayel's help,

07:32.452 --> 07:33.911
we're going to control the world.

07:43.838 --> 07:46.132
MEXICO CITY

09:32.363 --> 09:35.866
We want guarantees that you can provide
for us without any delays.

09:36.659 --> 09:37.618
We can.

09:38.786 --> 09:40.871
We're the biggest organization in Mexico.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.874
This new route will be a priority for us.

09:43.958 --> 09:47.378
MAYEL ZAMBRANO, ISMAEL'S SON
CARTEL DE SINALOA'S EMISSARY

09:58.431 --> 10:00.683
Joaquin? I'm opening a route in Moscow,

10:00.975 --> 10:03.060
but I'm worried about
our production capacities.

10:03.227 --> 10:05.313
We're up to our necks,
but don't worry about that.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.108
You keep opening routes,
I'll handle the production.

11:11.337 --> 11:16.092
PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE
OFFICIAL RESIDENCE, MEXICO CITY

11:34.318 --> 11:35.528
Sorry for the delay, Conrado.

11:35.653 --> 11:36.779
No problem, sir.

11:38.155 --> 11:38.989
You saw this?

11:40.282 --> 11:43.244
The PTI assholes are already making
a media campaign

11:43.327 --> 11:45.371
for this guy that's running
for the presidency.

11:47.289 --> 11:49.750
As if youth and beauty
could get them the power back.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.252
MEXICO'S STATE GOVERNOR CONTINUES
WITH PUBLIC WORKS

11:54.839 --> 11:56.715
They've confirmed he's their candidate?

11:57.508 --> 11:58.843
It's a very bad kept secret.

11:59.218 --> 12:01.303
He's their new image.

12:02.054 --> 12:03.973
But we're not going to make it
easy for them.

12:05.433 --> 12:08.102
Let's see how long the young governor
upholds that clean image.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.355
Anyway, I didn't call you for that.

12:12.773 --> 12:16.318
I want details on that security plan
for the meeting with the chancellor.

12:16.652 --> 12:17.820
You brought the report?

12:18.070 --> 12:18.988
Here it is.

12:21.574 --> 12:22.741
Sir, if I may,

12:23.617 --> 12:25.494
you have to know how to hit
the PTI people.

12:26.495 --> 12:29.832
If you'd like, I could help you find
something to damage the governor's image.

12:31.709 --> 12:32.710
Don't worry.

12:33.085 --> 12:35.421
Ramiro, the presidential spokesman,
is already on it.

12:58.319 --> 12:59.737
-Hello?
-It's me.

13:00.988 --> 13:02.406
They're trying to smear our man.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.702
Find out where they'll try to strike.

13:07.870 --> 13:08.787
Yes, sir.

13:46.116 --> 13:49.411
Here's where we're going to build
the biggest drug lab in the world.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.873
It's not easy to get here,
so we'll be left alone.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.708
What about the land owners?

13:56.794 --> 13:59.255
They'll have to sell it,
like it or not. Damaso,

13:59.713 --> 14:01.799
I'd like Quiño and you
to handle the logistics.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.009
How big will this place be?

14:05.094 --> 14:06.887
More than 200 hectares, man,

14:07.179 --> 14:08.347
but we'll just be using two.

14:09.056 --> 14:11.058
The rest will be to plant weed and poppy.

14:11.976 --> 14:14.353
I want this place to have phone,
water service, electricity,

14:14.603 --> 14:17.147
laundry service, internet,
all the amenities

14:17.273 --> 14:20.526
so people only worry about producing
and not about getting out of here.

14:21.610 --> 14:24.405
More than a lab, I want this
to be like a miniature city.

14:26.365 --> 14:28.576
A city worthy of the
world's biggest organization.

14:45.134 --> 14:50.180
MEXICO CITY

16:56.098 --> 16:59.601
INCOMING CALL
FRANCO

17:54.490 --> 17:55.949
What's up, Mayel?

17:56.033 --> 17:57.534
MALAYSIA

17:57.618 --> 18:00.621
I'm sorry to call so early.
I'm in Malaysia.

18:01.413 --> 18:03.624
What are the chances of opening up
a lab over there?

18:03.957 --> 18:05.125
We have a shot.

18:05.542 --> 18:07.669
There are some investors
that are very interested.

18:08.504 --> 18:10.672
If we make the merch there,

18:11.256 --> 18:13.550
we'll be able to take over
more countries in Asia.

18:14.301 --> 18:15.844
I'm in the middle of negotiations,

18:15.969 --> 18:17.387
and I talked to the twins in Chicago.

18:17.679 --> 18:19.723
They're able to find
some raw material in China.

18:20.057 --> 18:20.891
Good.

18:22.059 --> 18:24.561
Keep up the negotiations,
and keep me informed,too.

18:27.856 --> 18:29.608
This first edition of the Security
and Family Fair

18:29.691 --> 18:30.692
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY
MEXICO CITY

18:30.776 --> 18:34.988
has the objective of highlighting
the importance of preventing crime

18:35.322 --> 18:38.617
to reduce the crime rates in the city.

18:39.201 --> 18:41.120
The relationship between police...

18:42.871 --> 18:44.123
and citizens...

18:46.959 --> 18:51.338
is fundamental to make our capital

18:52.965 --> 18:56.969
a safe place for you and your families.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.514
I am very thankful again
to you for coming...

19:02.516 --> 19:04.935
and I'll leave you with the agents

19:05.018 --> 19:08.313
that will be in charge of handing out
more detailed information

19:08.814 --> 19:13.569
about the work that is done daily
to benefit every citizen.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.112
Thank you very much.

19:42.848 --> 19:43.765
What are you doing here?

19:44.099 --> 19:45.976
I've been calling you for months,
and you don't answer.

19:46.059 --> 19:47.186
I need to understand why.

19:47.603 --> 19:48.687
There's nothing to understand.

19:49.396 --> 19:51.023
I just don't want to see you.

19:52.399 --> 19:54.568
What happened? Why this sudden switch?

19:54.651 --> 19:56.653
No, you got confused. That's all.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.282
Our relationship was always contractual.

20:00.866 --> 20:01.742
It has always been like that.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.410
Buying and selling.

20:12.419 --> 20:13.295
This is what you want, right?

20:14.171 --> 20:15.255
You are a son of a bitch.

20:15.339 --> 20:16.381
Stop pretending.

20:17.716 --> 20:18.926
This is more than enough.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.720
Now take it and never look for me again.

20:23.931 --> 20:24.848
Don't worry.

20:26.141 --> 20:27.267
You'll never see me again.

21:27.369 --> 21:28.245
Are you leaving?

21:28.996 --> 21:29.871
Yes.

21:31.707 --> 21:32.791
Why are you in such a hurry?

21:35.460 --> 21:37.963
Let's celebrate our first month
by spending the night together.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.092
We are not going to see
each other again, Ramon.

21:43.719 --> 21:44.636
Why not?

21:46.138 --> 21:47.597
I thought we were doing fine.

21:48.223 --> 21:49.099
Yes,

21:50.100 --> 21:51.518
we were doing fine.

22:05.699 --> 22:08.785
The scholarship law for sons
of single mothers

22:08.869 --> 22:09.870
CONGRESS
MEXICO CITY

22:09.953 --> 22:12.956
means breaking a cycle

22:13.081 --> 22:16.585
and trying to get those kids
out of poverty.

22:16.835 --> 22:21.882
Taking them out of temptation
for delinquency and drug trafficking.

22:22.049 --> 22:27.929
By a majority vote, the
scholarship and educational stimuli law

22:28.055 --> 22:31.516
to financially support single mothers
has been approved.

22:39.691 --> 22:41.193
Congratulations, deputy.

22:41.318 --> 22:42.319
Thank you so much.

22:42.402 --> 22:43.987
You had excellent arguments.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.198
But I don't understand
why do you work so hard.

22:46.698 --> 22:48.825
I can give you anything you want.

22:49.743 --> 22:52.913
You should stop talking
so much shit and get to work.

22:53.455 --> 22:55.040
Have a good day, deputy.

23:06.593 --> 23:07.552
Cheers!

23:07.677 --> 23:09.012
Cheers! And lots of cash!

23:10.222 --> 23:11.598
-Well said.
-For you.

23:11.681 --> 23:12.599
Cheers.

23:15.602 --> 23:16.478
Let's eat.

23:16.812 --> 23:17.938
Congratulations, Joaquin.

23:30.158 --> 23:31.284
How far along is it?

23:32.160 --> 23:33.245
We're moving fast.

23:34.371 --> 23:35.622
The land is already ours.

23:39.709 --> 23:42.003
Bravo found us cheap laber, too.

23:53.306 --> 23:56.476
TEPEHUANO NATIVES

24:01.481 --> 24:04.151
When this laboratory and the one
in Malaysia are done,

24:04.818 --> 24:07.279
we're going to have merch
to supply the entire world.

24:08.780 --> 24:09.739
Cheers to you

24:10.699 --> 24:11.908
and your empire.

24:12.659 --> 24:14.578
Did you always know
you'd make it this far?

24:16.204 --> 24:17.581
I always knew I wanted more.

24:18.582 --> 24:19.833
And I still do.

24:20.750 --> 24:22.377
It hasn't been easy, but here we are.

24:23.837 --> 24:25.255
I don't have to tell you that.

24:26.173 --> 24:28.675
For better or for worse, your father
always knew how to build up

24:28.758 --> 24:30.719
the character you needed
to accomplish all of this.

24:31.136 --> 24:32.053
What did you say?

24:36.057 --> 24:37.142
I'm sorry, Joaquin.

24:44.524 --> 24:46.651
What is your place inside
this organization, Lora?

24:47.319 --> 24:48.778
-I'm the head lawyer.
-Exactly.

24:49.029 --> 24:51.114
You work for me, don't forget that.

24:51.531 --> 24:52.699
You're just another employee.

24:53.867 --> 24:56.328
I'm very sorry,
this will not happen again.

25:00.457 --> 25:01.833
Sir, it's Mr. Sol.

25:06.213 --> 25:07.047
Hello?

25:27.234 --> 25:28.443
What's up, Conrado?

25:28.818 --> 25:31.029
What's the important message
you wanted to give me?

25:32.614 --> 25:33.615
It's about the DEA.

25:34.824 --> 25:35.909
They have a message for you.

25:38.703 --> 25:41.665
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY
MEXICO CITY

25:46.086 --> 25:47.545
What message do you want me to give him?

26:00.267 --> 26:02.769
Reduce the trafficking
of heroin in the United States,

26:04.020 --> 26:06.523
but above all, don't open
the lab in Malaysia.

26:07.065 --> 26:08.233
They are well informed.

26:09.901 --> 26:11.319
It's the DEA, Joaquin.

26:13.363 --> 26:15.615
They are the ones who set
the rules for the game.

26:16.616 --> 26:18.868
I don't need to tell you
that the best thing for all of us

26:19.452 --> 26:21.204
is that you cooperate with them.

26:22.831 --> 26:25.000
Bravo, call Mayel.

26:40.473 --> 26:41.558
MALAYSIA

26:41.641 --> 26:42.600
Hello?

26:44.019 --> 26:46.062
How are the negotiations
for the lab going?

26:46.146 --> 26:47.230
Excellent.

26:47.564 --> 26:49.441
I'll be meeting our partners
in a few hours.

26:50.650 --> 26:52.902
This will be huge
for our organization, Joaquin.

26:55.071 --> 26:56.614
I just need your confirmation.

27:01.661 --> 27:03.663
Go ahead. Close the deal.

27:11.338 --> 27:15.050
Bravo, get my plane ready.

27:15.508 --> 27:16.426
I want to go to La Tuna.

27:45.997 --> 27:47.791
You told me I wasn't going to be
more than a servant.

27:51.169 --> 27:52.212
A lowly servant.

27:53.630 --> 27:55.465
You were so wrong, Camilo.

27:56.174 --> 27:58.635
I've gotten so high that I don't even
have to obey the gringos.

28:33.711 --> 28:35.088
It could be true, though,

28:36.965 --> 28:40.093
that if you hadn't been such an asshole
to me, I wouldn't be where I am now.

28:42.178 --> 28:43.138
Thank you, Dad.

29:06.536 --> 29:07.704
xxx

29:08.329 --> 29:09.831
Play all night long for my dad.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.167
I want him to be happy,
at least for today.

29:12.417 --> 29:13.334
It'll be a pleasure.

29:30.935 --> 29:33.146
I've been waiting for this coffee
a long time, Ramiro.

29:33.813 --> 29:36.149
You know how it is,
work doesn't let you do anything.

29:39.277 --> 29:40.278
What do you want to coordinate?

29:40.361 --> 29:41.488
RAMIRO
PRESIDENTIAL SPOKESPERSON

29:41.571 --> 29:46.034
We're preparing a hit against two
main operators in the Sinaloa Cartel.

29:46.493 --> 29:48.703
I just want to coordinate
the dates with you.

29:49.329 --> 29:51.247
I don't want to do my press conference

29:51.372 --> 29:54.918
when you're about to put up news
to damage Esteban Prieto's image.

29:59.506 --> 30:02.592
According to the president,
it's going to be a media bomb, right?

30:06.137 --> 30:08.264
I don't want this operation
to be under the radar.

30:09.557 --> 30:10.642
You understand, right?

30:13.228 --> 30:17.023
I'll tell my secretary to tell you when
we're going to put the news up.

30:18.566 --> 30:19.567
Thanks a lot.

30:20.360 --> 30:23.071
They told me you started
your career in the PTI.

30:26.074 --> 30:27.575
I was young and stupid.

30:29.410 --> 30:31.037
We all were, right?

30:31.120 --> 30:32.080
Of course.

30:32.455 --> 30:36.584
After two governments with the PAD,
the PTI can't stand looking at me.

30:36.793 --> 30:39.045
There's still some time left
before the elections,

30:40.255 --> 30:42.590
but we decided to get a head start.

30:43.967 --> 30:46.845
We're going to tear the candidate down
before he starts soaring.

30:47.303 --> 30:48.429
If I can help you out with anything,

30:49.138 --> 30:50.515
don't hesitate to tell me.

30:51.641 --> 30:53.059
I don't know much about Esteban,

30:53.977 --> 30:55.311
only that Colina is his uncle.

30:56.521 --> 30:57.564
That's more than enough.

30:58.481 --> 31:01.568
Everyone knows that Colina
is up to his neck in dirt.

31:02.277 --> 31:04.946
We'll just make that dirt
get on his nephew as well.

31:07.740 --> 31:10.493
Colina was a state governor
before Prieto, right?

31:10.618 --> 31:11.619
Exactly.

31:12.787 --> 31:14.289
His nephew inherited his position.

31:14.789 --> 31:18.918
But before that, when Esteban Prieto
was the president of congress,

31:19.335 --> 31:21.880
he endorsed two public accounts
to his uncle

31:22.380 --> 31:24.424
that were clearly stolen from the state.

31:26.593 --> 31:29.053
-Corrupt uncle...
-Corrupt nephew.

31:30.638 --> 31:32.515
I think we can turn this news around.

31:33.641 --> 31:37.312
We can paint Esteban as a victim that
will only get his public image damaged

31:38.021 --> 31:40.523
because his uncle is a questionable man.

31:41.608 --> 31:42.901
Something like:

31:44.193 --> 31:46.863
"Esteban Prieto is not his uncle."

31:50.783 --> 31:54.579
Darling, here's your guacamole
and pico de gallo I know you like so much.

31:56.623 --> 31:59.375
I'm so happy that you were able
to visit him.

32:00.376 --> 32:02.378
You can't live life
carrying grudges.

32:04.839 --> 32:05.965
How are you, Mom?

32:06.549 --> 32:07.634
Do you need anything?

32:10.887 --> 32:12.388
I just need you to take care of yourself.

32:15.266 --> 32:16.976
Don't worry, luck is on my side.

32:19.020 --> 32:20.897
Only good things
have been happening lately.

32:22.148 --> 32:23.232
I am glad to hear that, son.

32:24.817 --> 32:25.652
Eat.

33:20.581 --> 33:22.500
For your loyal service all these years.

33:26.129 --> 33:27.296
Do you remember when we met?

33:27.797 --> 33:30.508
When I helped you buy
your first hotels in Guadalajara.

33:31.551 --> 33:32.844
That was a long time ago.

33:34.303 --> 33:37.598
Those years gave you the courage
to say that about my father.

33:40.685 --> 33:41.936
I didn't mean to offend you.

33:50.111 --> 33:52.030
You have been loyal all these years, Lora.

33:56.075 --> 33:57.326
You're not just an employee.

33:58.077 --> 33:59.078
You're a friend.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.331
It's an honor, Joaquin.

34:06.544 --> 34:07.462
Thank you.

34:10.798 --> 34:12.592
I categorically deny

34:14.218 --> 34:18.556
the accusations made by the media

34:19.682 --> 34:22.518
that attempt to question my integrity
as a public officer,

34:23.811 --> 34:24.645
accusing me

34:25.229 --> 34:28.775
of endorsing alleged corrupt acts

34:29.150 --> 34:34.030
carried out by my uncle,
former governor Roberto Colina.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.492
And I have proof to show my innocence.

34:38.576 --> 34:41.996
This is a list of the delegates

34:43.039 --> 34:44.916
that voted in favor

34:45.833 --> 34:47.210
of endorsing the accounts

34:48.419 --> 34:51.255
that I was accused of endorsing.

34:52.215 --> 34:54.759
The only thing I did as the president
of the local congress

34:54.884 --> 34:59.597
was to respect their autonomy.

35:01.182 --> 35:04.435
If there is any problem
with these accounts,

35:05.394 --> 35:11.150
these delegates, not me, are the ones who
will have to answer for their actions.

35:11.859 --> 35:14.403
And I want to be clear about something:

35:14.529 --> 35:16.489
I am not my uncle.

35:17.573 --> 35:18.491
Good evening.

35:24.914 --> 35:26.874
When the lab is working at 100%,

35:26.958 --> 35:29.961
we estimate it will produce more than
100 kilos of synthetic drugs a day.

35:30.378 --> 35:31.337
Hello.

35:32.296 --> 35:33.631
When will this be done?

35:34.173 --> 35:35.758
In approximately two months.

35:39.262 --> 35:41.264
Whatever you need,
ask Quino and Dámaso.

35:41.681 --> 35:43.307
I want this to be finished
as soon as possible.

35:46.769 --> 35:48.146
Check the marked page.

35:52.066 --> 35:54.110
We got an advance copy.

35:55.027 --> 35:56.404
This will be in every bookstore tomorrow.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.715
We're going to look like idiots, Conrado.

36:19.510 --> 36:22.221
The only drug lord on
the "World's Richest" list

36:24.640 --> 36:25.558
is Mexican,

36:28.853 --> 36:29.729
and he's not even in jail.

36:38.654 --> 36:41.532
Mr. Ismael says he'll be a little late.
Please wait.

36:42.325 --> 36:43.659
Get me some lemonade, please.

36:43.784 --> 36:44.911
ISMAEL ZAMBRANO'S HOUSE
CULIACAN, SINALOA

36:52.460 --> 36:53.294
Hello?

36:53.628 --> 36:54.712
Mr. Lora, how are you, man?

36:54.795 --> 36:55.922
LAS LOMAS RESIDENCE, SINALOA CARTEL
MEXICO CITY

36:56.005 --> 36:57.715
My brother and I are just passing
through Mexico

36:57.882 --> 37:00.885
and I wanted to run some legal stuff
by you. Can we meet?

37:02.470 --> 37:03.679
How long will you be here?

37:04.180 --> 37:06.265
Until tomorrow morning.
You know how it is.

37:06.724 --> 37:07.683
Do us the favor.

37:08.267 --> 37:09.769
Just take a flight. We'll be waiting.

37:10.269 --> 37:11.520
We are at the Lomas house.

37:14.315 --> 37:15.650
Thank you for coming, Conrado.

37:16.734 --> 37:20.279
I'm very glad that the governor walked
away from all those allegations scot-free.

37:21.072 --> 37:22.740
Esteban is very grateful to you.

37:24.033 --> 37:25.910
Now more than ever,
he's sure that you'll make a great

37:25.993 --> 37:28.037
secretary of state for his term.

37:29.038 --> 37:30.581
But that's not I called you for.

37:32.541 --> 37:34.126
I want you to meet someone.

37:42.385 --> 37:45.012
Conrado, this is my goddaughter, Bertha.

37:47.515 --> 37:48.599
Your future wife.

37:54.814 --> 37:55.856
Pleased to meet you.

38:29.640 --> 38:30.558
What's up, Lora?

38:30.933 --> 38:32.101
-What's up?
-Come in.

38:32.184 --> 38:33.185
Thank you.

39:02.590 --> 39:03.841
Fucking traitors.

39:14.810 --> 39:15.728
What do you want?

39:15.811 --> 39:19.315
Remind your boss that when
we ask, we receive.

39:21.650 --> 39:22.860
I'll let him know.

39:22.943 --> 39:24.403
You'll be doing much more than that.

39:40.586 --> 39:42.546
Those are the charges against you.

39:44.799 --> 39:47.468
A criminal case of drug trafficking,
open in San Diego.

39:51.138 --> 39:53.891
El Chapo needs a lesson, and you're going
to help us give it to him.

39:54.767 --> 39:57.061
If you don't want us to arrest
and extradite you,

39:57.186 --> 39:58.521
you're going to have to work with us.

40:05.027 --> 40:07.363
