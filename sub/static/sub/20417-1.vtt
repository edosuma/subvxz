00:08.342 --> 00:11.276
Humanity is getting closer

00:11.278 --> 00:12.411
to the truth,

00:13.646 --> 00:14.646
to us.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.649
We won't let that happen.

00:43.276 --> 00:44.610
Ok. I got to go.

00:44.612 --> 00:45.612
Bye.

00:49.449 --> 00:51.050
What's that?

00:51.052 --> 00:52.818
What's that?

00:52.820 --> 00:54.787
It wasn't there before.

00:54.789 --> 00:56.155
Huh. Weird.

00:58.458 --> 01:00.125
Why's the door open?

01:00.127 --> 01:01.193
It's open?

01:09.302 --> 01:10.836
Oh, come on.

01:12.505 --> 01:13.705
You kidding?

01:13.707 --> 01:14.373
Where did that come from?

01:14.375 --> 01:15.375
I,

01:16.476 --> 01:18.477
oh jeez, look at, look!

01:20.346 --> 01:21.380
What happened here?

01:21.382 --> 01:23.615
Seriously? I.

01:23.617 --> 01:24.550
Wow.

01:24.552 --> 01:25.484
Where did this come from?

01:25.486 --> 01:26.318
Do you know?

01:26.320 --> 01:27.152
Yeah I do know.

01:27.154 --> 01:28.154
It's,

01:28.755 --> 01:29.755
it's Steve.

01:32.258 --> 01:33.092
This is ridiculous.

01:33.094 --> 01:33.725
Look at the place.

01:33.727 --> 01:35.094
Look at the place!

01:35.096 --> 01:37.429
This is bizarre.

01:37.431 --> 01:38.729
No, it's not bizarre.

01:38.731 --> 01:42.367
It's what happens when
you let Steve, hold on.

01:42.369 --> 01:43.368
This is ridiculous.

01:43.370 --> 01:44.470
Is this blood?

01:44.472 --> 01:45.737
Yeah, don't touch it.

01:45.739 --> 01:46.572
Look at this place!

01:46.574 --> 01:48.307
What's going on?

01:48.309 --> 01:50.442
I'm gonna call him again.

01:51.344 --> 01:53.178
What about that camera?

01:53.180 --> 01:54.146
The camera?

01:54.148 --> 01:55.348
Steve, you need to, hold on!

01:55.349 --> 01:56.715
Steve, you need to
call me back right now,

01:56.717 --> 01:58.684
this place is a wreck.

01:58.686 --> 02:00.752
Call me back, right now.

02:21.608 --> 02:22.908
Are you nervous?

02:22.910 --> 02:25.878
No, I'm ok, how about you?

02:25.880 --> 02:26.912
A little.

02:26.914 --> 02:27.914
I mean.

02:29.716 --> 02:30.716
Hello!

02:32.419 --> 02:33.819
You ready?

02:33.821 --> 02:35.420
Uh?

02:35.422 --> 02:36.522
Flux capacitor.

02:39.526 --> 02:40.392
Hey, you got
that extra thingy, right?

02:40.394 --> 02:41.660
You ordered it?

02:41.662 --> 02:45.430
You want to explain
what is going on here?

02:45.432 --> 02:49.868
This is where we're going
to conduct our experiment.

02:49.870 --> 02:50.936
And we have,

02:52.272 --> 02:55.574
well all your cameras
are set-up, which I,

02:55.576 --> 02:57.876
there's a lot of them.

02:57.878 --> 02:58.878
Alright.

02:59.879 --> 03:01.380
Don't wanna miss anything.

03:01.382 --> 03:02.382
Striking.

03:06.419 --> 03:09.488
You switched out
these fuses, right?

03:12.525 --> 03:14.193
It's kinda weird.

03:14.195 --> 03:16.428
I don't, I don't know what
am I supposed to like?

03:16.430 --> 03:17.729
Nah, just do your thing.

03:17.731 --> 03:18.931
Just do...

03:18.933 --> 03:21.733
why don't you
give me the camera?

03:21.735 --> 03:24.636
Why don't you
explain to everyone

03:24.638 --> 03:26.605
what else you've brought us?

03:26.607 --> 03:27.607
Okay, well,

03:29.242 --> 03:30.909
follow me everyone.

03:30.911 --> 03:33.345
Over here we have my baby.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.615
Now this is a refurbished

03:36.617 --> 03:40.619
customized beta-model
specter v62 video camera.

03:40.621 --> 03:42.788
This is the only kind that
can simultaneously record

03:42.790 --> 03:46.592
and playback super
slow motion video.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.627
Now you know why we hired you.

03:48.629 --> 03:49.827
Yeah, I get it.

03:49.829 --> 03:52.598
Look, as long as I get
to direct this shoot

03:52.600 --> 03:54.600
with all of my cameras

03:54.602 --> 03:58.470
and get exclusive rights
to this little seance,

03:58.472 --> 03:59.571
I'm good.

04:08.281 --> 04:09.581
So, should I look at the lens?

04:09.583 --> 04:10.682
Straight down the lens, yeah.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.584
Whenever you're ready.

04:14.587 --> 04:15.986
I'm Nicole Fallek.

04:15.988 --> 04:20.291
I am a doctoral student in
experimental and applied physics.

04:20.293 --> 04:25.264
And your relationship
with Martin Callahan is?

04:25.266 --> 04:29.501
I am professor Callahan's
teaching assistant.

04:29.503 --> 04:31.336
And I don't appreciate
the implication.

04:31.338 --> 04:34.273
My name is Martin Callahan.

04:34.275 --> 04:36.508
Tenured professor of
applied physics at Cal-tech

04:36.510 --> 04:40.045
and the youngest winner
of the Selder prize.

04:41.581 --> 04:44.616
You also have
a master's in theology.

04:44.618 --> 04:47.286
Would you say that your
experiences in seeing a demon

04:47.288 --> 04:50.322
were somehow divinely related?

04:50.324 --> 04:51.623
I don't really
call them demons.

04:51.625 --> 04:55.861
I prefer to call them
trans dimensional entities.

04:55.863 --> 04:56.895
You mean they've experienced

04:56.897 --> 04:59.765
what's known as night terrors?

04:59.767 --> 05:02.000
Night terrors, yeah.

05:02.002 --> 05:06.438
Night terrors is the western
scientific explanation,

05:07.573 --> 05:08.573
that we are

05:11.711 --> 05:14.446
awaking paralyzed in rem sleep

05:14.448 --> 05:18.750
and somehow hallucinating
these evil entities.

05:18.752 --> 05:21.687
Right, so if that is the case,

05:21.689 --> 05:24.723
then why is it
that every culture,

05:26.392 --> 05:27.759
every single culture,

05:27.761 --> 05:30.662
that we have interprets
it the exact same way?

05:30.664 --> 05:35.600
Time dilates in rem sleep
by a factor of 10 to 1,000

05:35.602 --> 05:38.737
depending on the
individual and brain waves.

05:38.739 --> 05:42.808
So what we perceive as 10 to
1,000 seconds in dream time

05:42.810 --> 05:46.645
is only one second in
real or awake time.

05:46.647 --> 05:50.415
These entities, plus
ghosts and spirits,

05:51.617 --> 05:54.453
operate on a different
time dilation.

05:54.455 --> 05:56.888
Somewhere on a factor
of 1,000 and 10,000.

05:56.890 --> 06:00.792
So for every 1,000 to
10,000 seconds of theirs,

06:01.894 --> 06:03.695
or 16 minutes to three
hours in their time,

06:03.697 --> 06:06.765
is equivalent to
one second of ours.

06:06.767 --> 06:09.701
The human eye can perceive
detail in a lit environment

06:09.703 --> 06:12.471
up to 1/100th of a second.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.705
In darkness,

06:13.707 --> 06:16.041
we can perceive a
flicker of light

06:16.043 --> 06:19.144
if it is 1/200th of
a second or longer.

06:19.146 --> 06:21.747
Anything shorter than
1/200th of a second,

06:21.749 --> 06:24.483
in our normal conscious state,

06:24.485 --> 06:26.017
we don't perceive at all.

06:26.019 --> 06:28.787
It's as if it isn't there.

06:28.789 --> 06:29.688
But it is there.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.757
We just can't see it.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.658
If we awake in a rem state,

06:33.660 --> 06:37.496
our brain waves and perception
are still in a time dilation.

06:37.498 --> 06:40.699
So we're actually
able to still see,

06:42.502 --> 06:44.903
although very temporarily,

06:44.905 --> 06:46.872
what was once invisible to us.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.673
That's why we only
see trans dimensionals

06:48.675 --> 06:51.810
for a brief second in our
normal conscious state.

06:51.812 --> 06:54.713
They would have to stand
still for 16 minutes

06:54.715 --> 06:56.748
to three hours in their time

06:56.750 --> 06:59.951
for us to see it for
one second in our time.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.987
Have you ever been
to the Grand Canyon?

07:01.989 --> 07:03.688
No, no.

07:03.690 --> 07:06.825
Because I can't describe to
you how big it actually is

07:06.827 --> 07:08.825
because there's no
frame of reference.

07:08.827 --> 07:11.730
I can't put that in perspective
to make sense to you.

07:11.732 --> 07:12.831
Okay, that's the way this is.

07:12.833 --> 07:15.567
I can't put it into
perspective, okay,

07:15.569 --> 07:18.103
how much fear it is when
someone wakes in rem sleep

07:18.105 --> 07:21.840
and actually sees one
of these entities.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.975
I can't put that
into perspective.

07:23.977 --> 07:24.810
Okay, all of this.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.478
This is science.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.213
Okay, this is science.

07:28.215 --> 07:29.848
Everything is science.

07:29.850 --> 07:32.684
It's not superstition, okay?

07:32.686 --> 07:35.086
It's not magic, hocus pocus.

07:35.988 --> 07:37.589
This is science.

07:38.858 --> 07:42.761
And this is what we're
gonna try to find out.

07:44.698 --> 07:47.899
These entities, plus
ghosts and spirits,

07:49.202 --> 07:51.603
operate on a different
time dilation.

08:01.848 --> 08:05.884
Captain's log,
star date 2013.11.19.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.821
3,000 miles, five days,

08:09.823 --> 08:11.256
weary travelers

08:11.258 --> 08:14.826
through the backwoods
of our great country

08:14.828 --> 08:18.730
to land on a new
starship and a new home

08:18.732 --> 08:20.799
with my lovely wife.

08:20.801 --> 08:21.801
Say hello.

08:22.635 --> 08:24.903
Hello, where are we?

08:24.905 --> 08:27.138
Girl you will find out.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.206
One second.

08:29.876 --> 08:30.909
Ta da!

08:30.911 --> 08:32.277
Welcome home baby.

08:33.111 --> 08:34.246
Oh my gosh.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.015
Oh my gosh!

08:38.951 --> 08:40.018
This is,

08:40.020 --> 08:41.785
this is beautiful!

08:43.655 --> 08:44.890
Glad you love it.

08:44.892 --> 08:48.760
Oh my gosh, it's furnished.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.263
I understand some of
the secrecy last month.

08:51.265 --> 08:52.197
Maybe later.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.632
- Alright, cool.
- Okay. So.

08:53.634 --> 08:54.866
Well in that
vein let's go downstairs

08:54.868 --> 08:55.600
'cause that's where
the bedrooms are.

08:55.602 --> 08:56.234
Downstairs?

08:56.236 --> 08:57.068
Oh!

08:57.070 --> 08:58.303
Downstairs.

08:58.305 --> 08:59.070
These are upside down
houses in the hills.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.171
Oh.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.106
And this, this rail.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.040
The wrought iron?

09:02.042 --> 09:03.241
Yeah, the wrought iron.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.210
Like look at that,
that is so beautiful.

09:05.212 --> 09:08.113
I just wanna stay in
the spiral staircase.

09:08.115 --> 09:11.583
Here,
let me get the light for you.

09:11.585 --> 09:12.585
Okay.

09:13.586 --> 09:14.853
Wow.

09:14.855 --> 09:16.721
This is our master bedroom

09:16.723 --> 09:17.956
very nice.

09:17.958 --> 09:18.990
It's where
the magic will happen.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.158
I don't know, can it?

09:20.160 --> 09:21.226
I think it will.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.662
To be determined.

09:23.664 --> 09:24.829
Oh my gosh.

09:24.831 --> 09:25.864
Oh this bathroom.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.832
Why is there plastic?

09:27.834 --> 09:30.669
The owner was doing
painting during renovation.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.938
I love it when there's
a separate shower.

09:32.940 --> 09:35.273
More storage,
there's tons of space.

09:35.275 --> 09:37.042
And another bathroom here.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.043
Okay, and back here?

09:38.045 --> 09:41.012
Yes, another bedroom.

09:42.214 --> 09:43.648
Perfect place.

09:43.650 --> 09:45.650
I'm in shock!

09:45.652 --> 09:47.052
Can you believe it?

09:47.054 --> 09:50.722
And this wraps back around
to where we just came from.

09:50.724 --> 09:53.158
I know where I
wanna end the tour.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.893
I think it worked.

10:01.801 --> 10:03.969
Hold the sexy pose, baby.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.973
We've been here for three days.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.109
I understand this woman.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.812
What do you mean
you understand this woman?

10:13.814 --> 10:14.980
You do understand this woman.

10:14.982 --> 10:18.183
This is a very
oddly furnished house.

10:18.185 --> 10:21.786
It's not oddly furnished.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.021
What was that?

10:24.790 --> 10:26.658
Did you set those on the edge?

10:26.660 --> 10:29.094
I don't use toothpicks much.

10:29.096 --> 10:32.831
Wait a minute, David,
what just happened?

10:32.833 --> 10:33.898
David?

10:33.900 --> 10:35.000
Oh my god.

10:36.268 --> 10:38.236
It's going, it's going.

10:42.174 --> 10:43.074
Did you hear it again?

10:43.076 --> 10:43.908
Yes.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.410
It's on the ceiling.

10:45.412 --> 10:46.911
It's on the ceiling,
what are you talking about?

10:46.913 --> 10:48.079
Well I could hear it.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.882
It sounds like footsteps.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.417
We don't have a floor.

10:52.419 --> 10:53.885
It started with
a thump thump, like before.

10:53.887 --> 10:54.919
But now.

10:56.923 --> 10:58.223
That sounds like somebody's
walking on the ceiling.

10:58.225 --> 10:59.224
Exactly.

10:59.226 --> 11:02.694
But there's no floor above, so.

11:02.696 --> 11:04.162
That's on the roof,
that's really weird.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.864
That's really weird.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.198
It could be a rat or something.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.867
What are you suggesting?

11:08.869 --> 11:10.702
I'm suggesting
we try to document this.

11:10.704 --> 11:12.704
We keep the camera
on as much as we can.

11:12.706 --> 11:13.838
Oh my god.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.006
Oh my god, really?

11:15.008 --> 11:16.441
That's just so invasive.

11:16.443 --> 11:17.942
Then what's your idea?

11:17.944 --> 11:19.044
I don't have an idea.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.745
I'm upset about what's going on.

11:20.747 --> 11:22.047
We just need to have it nearby,

11:22.049 --> 11:23.348
so that we can
document this stuff.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.116
We need to show somebody this.

11:25.118 --> 11:28.887
How are we gonna show them if
we don't have the camera on.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.422
It's like a thump,

11:31.390 --> 11:32.991
but not a thump.

11:34.093 --> 11:36.227
It's not a bump, it's really...

11:36.229 --> 11:37.328
like a shoe thump?

11:37.330 --> 11:38.330
No, no.

11:39.965 --> 11:42.033
It's like a muffled sharp thump.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.201
That sounds, I know
it's contradictory,

11:43.203 --> 11:44.936
but the weird thing is,

11:44.938 --> 11:47.939
and this is what I wanna
know if you had heard it.

11:47.941 --> 11:51.743
It's like, it's
right in this space.

11:51.745 --> 11:52.977
In this kind of,

11:52.979 --> 11:54.179
wait wait!

11:56.116 --> 11:58.049
Did you just hear that?

12:04.123 --> 12:06.324
Let's be quiet for a second.

12:09.495 --> 12:10.829
Okay, see.

12:10.831 --> 12:11.830
It was there.

12:11.832 --> 12:12.832
Yeah.

12:13.966 --> 12:15.100
What if it's
the house settling,

12:15.102 --> 12:17.969
I mean that's gotta be, no?

12:17.971 --> 12:20.004
No, cause it's been consistent.

12:20.006 --> 12:22.207
Cause I heard two yesterday,

12:23.509 --> 12:24.909
and before that on Thursday,

12:24.911 --> 12:25.909
I heard,

12:25.911 --> 12:29.080
but I haven't heard
any one until here.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.815
I was hearing them
in the living room.

12:30.817 --> 12:33.118
But that one right now
was just right here.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.854
And we haven't heard them
at the same time until now.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.122
Come here, come here.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.124
Watch this.

12:43.395 --> 12:44.395
Whoa,

12:45.198 --> 12:46.364
alright what?

12:47.333 --> 12:49.234
I mean, not normal, right?

12:49.236 --> 12:50.869
But cool!

12:50.871 --> 12:52.237
Does it?

12:53.906 --> 12:55.273
Watch this ball.

12:59.946 --> 13:03.181
Okay here is
the lovely living room.

13:03.183 --> 13:05.183
With a gorgeous view.

13:08.053 --> 13:11.990
Where the majority of
the upstairs activity,

13:14.260 --> 13:15.393
is happening.

13:19.165 --> 13:22.233
Okay then downstairs
in the hallway,

13:28.307 --> 13:30.542
is where the majority of the,

13:30.544 --> 13:32.277
this is the hallway,

13:33.579 --> 13:36.214
where most of the downstairs
activity is happening.

13:39.285 --> 13:41.519
Okay, just like that.

13:41.521 --> 13:42.453
That sound.

13:42.455 --> 13:45.156
That's what I'm talking about.

13:51.163 --> 13:52.463
Oh my god, see?

13:59.104 --> 14:01.306
Those things were over here.

14:02.875 --> 14:07.111
This just happened, this
is really freaking me out.

14:07.113 --> 14:08.379
Okay.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.548
I don't wanna be here anymore.

14:10.550 --> 14:13.017
I'm done with this.

14:37.443 --> 14:38.443
What?

14:46.285 --> 14:47.118
Okay.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.253
Is it the wind?

14:54.894 --> 14:58.263
I think we should get
out of this house.

15:11.544 --> 15:13.378
Come here, come here.

15:22.955 --> 15:26.658
Hi, I'm David Katil, and
this is my wife Karen.

15:26.660 --> 15:28.359
We need help.

15:28.361 --> 15:31.696
Not normal help, we
need ghost hunters,

15:34.300 --> 15:37.168
paranormal investigators.

15:37.170 --> 15:41.105
I'm not sure what
you call yourselves,

15:41.107 --> 15:43.207
but we need your help.

15:43.209 --> 15:44.342
Ever since my wife and I...

15:44.344 --> 15:45.344
David.

15:46.946 --> 15:47.946
Okay.

15:49.014 --> 15:52.183
Whatever it is, it's
gotten physical.

15:54.019 --> 15:55.019
Here.

16:06.031 --> 16:08.733
That's the fourth night I've
woken up with that on my back.

16:08.735 --> 16:11.269
There's something here.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.637
Please help us.

16:12.639 --> 16:13.471
Please come.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.473
Soon.

16:23.582 --> 16:25.283
Should we get unloaded?

16:25.285 --> 16:27.318
Oh my gosh I'm so
psyched about this one.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.318
I think this is the one.

16:28.320 --> 16:29.620
This is the one we've
been waiting for.

16:29.622 --> 16:31.622
Don't you think so?

16:31.624 --> 16:33.391
My intuition bell's
ringing off the hook.

16:33.393 --> 16:35.493
I'm telling you, big time.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.427
It's gonna be great.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.628
This couple's fantabulous.

16:37.630 --> 16:38.997
The network, they're
gonna love them.

16:38.999 --> 16:40.164
They're young,
they're attractive,

16:40.166 --> 16:42.333
they're in love.

16:42.335 --> 16:46.237
They're so much like
my third husband and I.

16:46.239 --> 16:47.271
Are you recording this?

16:47.273 --> 16:48.306
Nope.

16:48.308 --> 16:49.674
The red light's on, Geoff.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.110
It's because the battery's low.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.444
You sure you're
not recording this?

16:53.446 --> 16:54.712
I am certain.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.347
I don't look good in a
close up, you know that.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.416
I do know that.

17:02.321 --> 17:03.521
What house is it?

17:03.523 --> 17:05.522
This one here.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.025
2062.

17:08.060 --> 17:09.160
Karen, right?

17:09.162 --> 17:10.528
Do I look okay?

17:13.165 --> 17:14.165
Hi.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.267
You must be Susan?

17:16.269 --> 17:17.335
Yes, David?

17:17.337 --> 17:18.603
Nice to meet you.

17:19.771 --> 17:20.771
Thanks.

17:22.407 --> 17:23.307
Is this everybody?

17:23.309 --> 17:24.541
Yeah, yeah.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.310
This is Cameron,
he's my director.

17:26.311 --> 17:28.079
Hey, how you doing?

17:28.080 --> 17:30.148
And that's Geoff.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.050
He's my technician.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.050
Please.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.719
Okay so I'm gonna ask you
a couple of questions now

17:34.721 --> 17:37.488
for our actual interview,
if that's okay?

17:37.490 --> 17:39.557
Are you feeling up for that?

17:39.559 --> 17:40.391
You've never ever had
anything like this

17:40.393 --> 17:41.826
happen to you before?

17:41.828 --> 17:44.262
When you were living
anywhere else before, or?

17:44.264 --> 17:44.962
No, no.

17:44.964 --> 17:47.732
Any strange, different things
that you might have noticed?

17:47.734 --> 17:49.233
Any experiences?

17:49.235 --> 17:50.668
Recent deaths in the family?

17:50.670 --> 17:52.370
Mom, dad?

17:52.372 --> 17:53.370
Nothing like that?

17:53.372 --> 17:54.739
How long
have you done this for?

17:54.741 --> 17:56.474
About six, seven years now.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.309
We've seen some intense things.

17:58.311 --> 17:59.243
Some hectic cases.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.645
Like this stuff?

18:00.647 --> 18:02.346
You know you guys are extreme,

18:02.348 --> 18:03.646
what can I tell you?

18:03.648 --> 18:06.084
The physical situation with
you is worrying, it is.

18:06.086 --> 18:10.488
But we've dealt with some
really, really strong spirits.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.558
And we've done a
good job so far.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.394
People have been okay.

18:16.396 --> 18:19.430
But have you ever
seen anything like this?

18:19.432 --> 18:20.798
You know it's
definitely negative.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.266
It feels negative.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.502
It definitely feels like
there's something here.

18:24.504 --> 18:25.470
It's okay, it's okay.

18:25.472 --> 18:26.404
I know, I know.

18:26.406 --> 18:27.672
Yeah, I'd say it's negative.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.373
Yeah it is, but.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.209
You know, sometimes they
just need to be spoken to.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.478
Sometimes you just need
to explain to these,

18:33.480 --> 18:35.546
these beings, for a
lack of a better term,

18:35.548 --> 18:37.548
that this is no longer
where they belong.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.250
This is not their dimension.

18:39.252 --> 18:41.252
They just struggle
to take that step,

18:41.254 --> 18:42.620
to move on.

18:42.622 --> 18:45.690
They don't realize
they've actually passed.

18:45.692 --> 18:48.693
And you've kind of just
entice them and invite them

18:48.695 --> 18:50.328
and tell them it's safe.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.262
It's, it's...

18:51.264 --> 18:51.863
it's gotten to that point.

18:51.865 --> 18:53.297
It's weird, it's evil.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.333
I was pushed down
onto the couch.

18:55.335 --> 18:56.534
It's, you know,

18:56.536 --> 18:58.736
something is clawing his back.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.171
This is bizarre,

19:00.173 --> 19:03.441
this is, this isn't
just you know...

19:03.443 --> 19:06.677
what you need to
know you're not crazy.

19:06.679 --> 19:09.247
That's what you've got to
know, you're not crazy.

19:09.249 --> 19:10.681
This is very real.

19:10.683 --> 19:11.683
It exists.

19:20.325 --> 19:23.394
David and Karen are here, over.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.563
Roger that.

19:26.565 --> 19:28.566
It's full tonight.

19:28.568 --> 19:32.236
You know, this is a good
time for us to be here.

19:32.238 --> 19:33.304
Point three.

19:43.515 --> 19:44.916
If that was you,

19:46.718 --> 19:49.887
make that noise again,
we want to hear it again.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.456
Did you hear it?

19:52.458 --> 19:53.257
No, was that Geoff?

19:53.259 --> 19:54.559
Is he downstairs?

19:55.861 --> 19:59.463
Come to this device
I have in my hand.

20:00.933 --> 20:02.500
We wanna help you.

20:07.339 --> 20:09.640
It's just a little chillier.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.943
It's slight, but it's here.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.784
We're not here to
harm any of you.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.494
Don't be afraid.

20:31.630 --> 20:34.599
Show us again that
you are with us.

20:37.502 --> 20:39.237
Oh man.

20:39.239 --> 20:40.239
Can you hear that?

20:41.241 --> 20:44.342
The chair's rocking.

20:44.344 --> 20:45.476
Did you hit it?

20:45.478 --> 20:48.246
No, I didn't touch it.

20:51.516 --> 20:53.284
Hey.

20:53.286 --> 20:55.084
Okay, it's late,

20:55.086 --> 20:58.322
we're just gonna call it a
night and all get some sleep.

20:58.324 --> 21:00.758
We'll do our background
research on the place tomorrow

21:00.760 --> 21:02.526
and then come back at night.

21:02.528 --> 21:04.428
Did you guys catch anything?

21:04.430 --> 21:06.330
Yeah, some possibilities.

21:06.332 --> 21:09.967
We'll let the cameras keep
recording while we're gone,

21:09.969 --> 21:12.670
so you two behave yourselves.

21:39.365 --> 21:40.831
David!

21:40.833 --> 21:42.400
David!

21:42.402 --> 21:43.402
Karen?

21:43.935 --> 21:45.436
Karen?

22:15.634 --> 22:17.368
Wait, what's that?

22:29.548 --> 22:30.548
Stop.

22:43.762 --> 22:44.995
It can't be.

22:48.667 --> 22:50.067
It can't be her.

22:54.639 --> 22:56.540
Why is she here David?

23:01.613 --> 23:04.148
I thought this was over.

23:04.150 --> 23:06.717
I can't go through this again.

23:12.624 --> 23:13.724
I, um.

23:15.160 --> 23:16.160
I'm sorry.

23:19.664 --> 23:21.966
Karen didn't want
me to tell you,

23:21.968 --> 23:23.667
she refuses talk about it.

23:23.669 --> 23:24.769
But, um,

23:25.904 --> 23:29.774
three years ago we lost
our daughter ashen.

23:30.609 --> 23:32.743
Karen's, she's in denial.

23:33.612 --> 23:35.913
She can't handle it.

23:35.915 --> 23:36.915
I'm sorry.

23:42.120 --> 23:45.856
We need to do an e.V.P
with these two now.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.504
I think there's a couple
of things that we can do,

24:00.506 --> 24:02.673
but most importantly
I think we should do

24:02.675 --> 24:06.677
an e.V.P. With the two
of you immediately.

24:06.679 --> 24:08.913
I think there are two
entities in this house.

24:08.915 --> 24:12.149
One, quite obviously,
is your daughter ashen.

24:12.151 --> 24:15.553
The other one, is a
negative presence,

24:15.555 --> 24:19.757
I feel that it's trapping
her, kinda holding her back,

24:19.759 --> 24:23.093
stopping her from
being able to move on.

24:23.095 --> 24:26.163
Time is of the essence, we
should do this right now

24:26.165 --> 24:29.233
if that's okay with
the both of you.

24:31.470 --> 24:34.839
Ashen, I'm with your
mother and father,

24:34.841 --> 24:36.707
can you come to us?

24:40.812 --> 24:43.747
Speak as loud as you can for us.

24:47.886 --> 24:50.754
Your parents miss you.

24:50.756 --> 24:54.725
Your mother misses you,
your father misses you,

24:54.727 --> 24:56.794
they love you very much.

25:01.166 --> 25:04.835
Karen, call to your
daughter, she needs you.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.036
I can't.

25:06.038 --> 25:08.606
You must tell her

25:08.608 --> 25:09.974
to call out to us.

25:18.116 --> 25:19.116
Ashen.

25:22.821 --> 25:23.821
It's mommy.

25:25.023 --> 25:27.892
I need you to come to us.

25:27.894 --> 25:29.159
Tell her to
scream as loud as she can.

25:29.161 --> 25:30.794
She was always very quiet.

25:30.796 --> 25:33.831
We need to know that
she's here, tell her!

25:33.833 --> 25:36.066
Ashen, scream for mommy.

25:37.869 --> 25:39.603
Scream real loud.

25:39.605 --> 25:42.072
Daddy and I miss you very much.

25:52.851 --> 25:54.818
Ashen, it's daddy.

25:54.820 --> 25:57.054
Are you with anyone?

25:57.056 --> 25:58.856
Are you okay, honey?

25:58.858 --> 26:01.025
We can't hear you
ashen, speak louder.

26:01.027 --> 26:02.826
Your mommy can't hear you.

26:02.828 --> 26:03.894
What is it?

26:03.896 --> 26:05.696
What's wrong?

26:05.698 --> 26:07.665
Ashen, are you hurt?

26:07.667 --> 26:08.667
Is someone?

26:26.918 --> 26:27.851
Karen.

26:27.853 --> 26:30.688
Just everyone leave me alone.

26:31.957 --> 26:32.823
No, no, no David.

26:32.825 --> 26:34.325
Just let her go.

26:34.327 --> 26:38.963
Geoff, I need you to get
to the bedroom hub now.

26:38.965 --> 26:40.664
I heard your daughter,

26:40.666 --> 26:43.000
she said she's being held
downstairs against her will.

26:43.002 --> 26:45.769
I think we have a way that
we can flush this being out

26:45.771 --> 26:46.937
that's holding her there.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.005
Yeah, but it's
theoretical, I mean...

26:48.007 --> 26:49.206
why's it theoretical?

26:49.208 --> 26:50.808
It's dangerous, it
hasn't been done before.

26:50.810 --> 26:53.243
Cameron, I need you
upstairs to capture it in Ir.

26:53.245 --> 26:57.181
This is the one we've
been waiting for.

26:57.183 --> 27:00.918
David, come with me,
your daughter needs you.

27:35.787 --> 27:38.989
Geoff, Susan, are you there?

27:44.696 --> 27:45.663
Susan, do you copy?

27:45.665 --> 27:46.665
Over.

27:49.701 --> 27:50.701
C'mon.

27:57.008 --> 27:58.075
Geoff?

27:59.444 --> 28:00.444
Susan?

28:10.989 --> 28:12.222
What the hell?

28:23.868 --> 28:24.868
Karen?

28:26.471 --> 28:27.471
David?

28:51.930 --> 28:52.930
Hey Geoff?

28:52.932 --> 28:53.932
Geoff?

30:57.155 --> 30:58.388
Wakey, wakey.

31:02.894 --> 31:04.127
You ghost hunters,

31:04.129 --> 31:06.296
quite a group aren't you?

31:09.167 --> 31:11.401
Complete strangers
call you guys up,

31:11.403 --> 31:14.104
and you believe
everything they tell you,

31:14.106 --> 31:16.373
you go right to their
house, spend the night.

31:16.375 --> 31:20.277
No research, no background
checks, nothing.

31:20.279 --> 31:22.212
You guys are idiots.

31:23.281 --> 31:25.582
How you doing pretty boy?

31:27.185 --> 31:29.319
Sweetheart, not you, him.

31:32.190 --> 31:36.126
I'd say he's doing
better than the others.

31:49.007 --> 31:53.243
You know, we both actually
thought you were kinda alright.

31:54.679 --> 31:56.513
The other two, nobody will miss.

31:56.515 --> 31:57.515
Mmm, no.

31:58.683 --> 32:00.684
But your team, I mean come on.

32:00.686 --> 32:03.654
You guys didn't no
research on this place.

32:03.656 --> 32:05.522
There were two
murders in this house.

32:05.524 --> 32:07.958
Two murders, how
do you miss that?

32:07.960 --> 32:11.028
We had so much spooky
crap set up for you guys.

32:11.030 --> 32:12.663
You would have really liked it.

32:12.665 --> 32:14.231
Much better than
the special effects

32:14.233 --> 32:16.199
in the videos that you saw.

32:16.201 --> 32:18.936
It's really amazing what people
can do with after effects.

32:18.938 --> 32:21.438
Or even just
some fishing-line,

32:21.440 --> 32:24.474
few speakers, and
a bunch of morons

32:24.476 --> 32:26.443
that are ready to believe
anything you tell them.

32:31.215 --> 32:34.318
Daddy, when do I
get to kill someone?

32:34.320 --> 32:37.254
Aw, come here, babydoll.

32:37.256 --> 32:40.724
Let me get the camera,
this is her first.

32:43.361 --> 32:47.364
Here you go, come down
right over here, okay?

32:47.366 --> 32:49.366
Let's wait for mommy.

32:51.102 --> 32:54.271
Honey, first off, I
am so proud of you...

32:54.273 --> 32:55.572
we.

32:55.574 --> 32:57.607
Sorry, we are so proud you.

32:57.609 --> 33:00.277
Mommy and daddy,
ashen you did such a good job...

33:00.279 --> 33:02.346
thank you mommy.

33:02.348 --> 33:03.981
It was great.

33:03.983 --> 33:07.451
Everything, all the
running around and hiding.

33:07.453 --> 33:08.552
It was fun.

33:08.554 --> 33:10.087
Are you ready?

33:10.089 --> 33:10.721
Okay.

33:10.723 --> 33:11.723
Yeah.

33:12.757 --> 33:13.557
You know what, let's
do this one together,

33:13.559 --> 33:14.291
what do you think?

33:14.293 --> 33:15.225
Okay.

33:15.227 --> 33:17.260
Okay, here.

33:17.262 --> 33:19.296
Hold real tight around my hands.

33:28.740 --> 33:29.740
Good.

33:32.243 --> 33:35.078
What'd we say, Seattle next?

33:35.080 --> 33:36.146
Uh, yeah!

33:36.148 --> 33:38.048
Seattle, I'm so excited.

33:38.050 --> 33:39.316
I'm so ready for Seattle.

33:39.318 --> 33:40.517
Me too.

33:40.519 --> 33:44.187
Pacific
northwest, it's gorgeous.

33:44.189 --> 33:47.624
Don't step on Cameron's hand.

34:36.407 --> 34:37.306
Five,

34:37.309 --> 34:38.141
four,

34:38.143 --> 34:39.141
three,

34:39.143 --> 34:40.277
two,

34:40.279 --> 34:41.279
one.

34:46.617 --> 34:49.351
That
was anti-climatic.

34:49.353 --> 34:50.487
So what do we do now?

34:50.489 --> 34:51.489
Now we wait.

34:53.324 --> 34:56.626
It'll be about 90 minutes
until he's in rem sleep.

35:03.101 --> 35:06.636
Okay, so what's going on now?

35:06.638 --> 35:09.506
Well, looks like he's asleep.

35:10.741 --> 35:15.445
The first rem sleep is the
shortest, about 10 minutes.

35:15.447 --> 35:18.281
We'll just keep
forwarding to real time

35:18.283 --> 35:21.585
every few seconds til
we catch something.

35:25.156 --> 35:26.156
So you

35:28.359 --> 35:31.361
fall behind because
of playback speed,

35:31.363 --> 35:33.663
skip ahead to current time,

35:33.665 --> 35:34.698
review again,

35:34.700 --> 35:37.300
instantly fall back, review,

35:38.302 --> 35:40.670
skip ahead again, then review.

35:42.340 --> 35:43.639
Right, right.

35:43.641 --> 35:47.611
Kind of like paying the
minimum on your credit card.

35:49.313 --> 35:51.648
We can always go back
and review it all later.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.450
But this way we can
try to catch something

35:53.452 --> 35:55.185
while he's sleeping.

36:02.560 --> 36:03.560
What?

36:04.562 --> 36:07.264
I've never seen that before.

36:09.401 --> 36:10.767
That was moving extremely fast.

36:10.769 --> 36:12.402
Slow down the frame rate.

36:12.404 --> 36:13.503
Right.

36:14.438 --> 36:16.907
We don't wanna miss anything.

36:18.876 --> 36:19.876
Oh my,

36:20.678 --> 36:22.546
I don't believe it,

36:26.551 --> 36:27.651
it's here.

36:40.231 --> 36:42.566
It was definitely here
at least 15 seconds or so

36:42.568 --> 36:44.234
before you woke up.

36:45.236 --> 36:46.236
Okay.

36:48.973 --> 36:52.342
Stop right here,
stop right here, go.

36:52.344 --> 36:53.577
Right there.

36:53.579 --> 36:55.712
It's casting a
shadow, which means,

36:55.714 --> 36:57.480
it has mass.

36:57.482 --> 36:58.648
It has mass.

36:59.550 --> 37:02.919
Okay, uh, go ahead play
it back, keep going.

37:02.921 --> 37:04.588
Okay, no no, stop right there.

37:04.590 --> 37:06.356
Back it up one frame.

37:06.358 --> 37:07.257
Now go frame by frame.

37:07.259 --> 37:07.891
Go frame by frame.

37:07.893 --> 37:09.626
Jesus.

37:09.628 --> 37:12.329
That thing could have been
standing right next to me.

37:12.331 --> 37:13.797
That's it right there.

37:13.799 --> 37:16.967
We need to go ahead and move
to phase two, uh, Nicole

37:16.969 --> 37:20.270
uh, play this
through, skip through

37:20.272 --> 37:22.239
in a real time review,
and see what we get.

37:22.241 --> 37:24.474
Anytime you see a straight
line or a blurred line,

37:24.476 --> 37:26.343
anything that looks
unordinary like that,

37:26.345 --> 37:28.245
let's power up to 8.5.

37:29.547 --> 37:33.516
8.5? We haven't tested
the capacity in this place.

37:33.518 --> 37:34.718
And the radiation at 8.5...

37:34.720 --> 37:36.853
is within the safety
limits, it's fine.

37:36.855 --> 37:38.288
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:38.290 --> 37:39.556
What radiation?

37:39.558 --> 37:41.556
The safety limits
if you haven't been

37:41.558 --> 37:44.628
subjecting yourself to it
during the testing phases, yes,

37:44.630 --> 37:45.762
but 8.5?

37:45.764 --> 37:47.731
What radiation?

37:47.733 --> 37:50.567
We'll be fine, it's
1/10th of a chest X-ray,

37:50.569 --> 37:52.902
which is gonna dissipate
rapidly from the center

37:52.904 --> 37:55.372
which is 100 times stronger,

37:55.374 --> 37:58.842
which is exactly where
Martin's gonna be at.

38:03.814 --> 38:06.049
Are your cameras rolling still?

38:11.489 --> 38:14.691
How long is it gonna
take him to fall asleep now?

38:14.693 --> 38:16.326
Martin's trained himself, so,

38:16.328 --> 38:19.462
if he wants, it won't
take long at all.

38:19.464 --> 38:20.664
Should be quick.

38:43.587 --> 38:46.389
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:46.391 --> 38:47.023
This whole thing,

38:47.025 --> 38:49.092
8.5 in untested outlets.

38:59.938 --> 39:00.970
Martin, wake up!

39:00.972 --> 39:03.039
Wake up Martin, wake up!

39:18.823 --> 39:19.904
Jason, do you see anything?

39:27.031 --> 39:28.932
Where is that thing?

39:29.767 --> 39:31.468
Forget this, man!

39:33.637 --> 39:34.804
C'mon, c'mon!

39:35.940 --> 39:37.741
This door won't open!

39:38.743 --> 39:39.709
It's not even locked,

39:39.711 --> 39:40.710
it's just not budging!

39:40.712 --> 39:42.445
Wait!

39:42.447 --> 39:44.147
Wait, stop stop stop.

39:49.854 --> 39:52.722
Do you see anything Jason?

39:52.724 --> 39:53.724
Where is it?!

40:02.433 --> 40:03.800
I did not sign
up for this, man!

40:03.802 --> 40:05.168
Stop, stop stop!

40:12.777 --> 40:14.811
C'mon, get it open!

40:17.648 --> 40:18.681
Quiet, quiet!

40:18.683 --> 40:19.683
Shut up!

40:37.068 --> 40:41.137
Give me light, give me
some light on the door!

40:47.678 --> 40:48.945
I got to go,
I have to get my phone!

40:48.947 --> 40:52.081
Wait, where are you going!?

41:15.806 --> 41:16.906
Martin?

41:16.908 --> 41:18.808
Martin, where are you?

41:22.746 --> 41:24.147
Martin?

41:24.149 --> 41:25.149
Martin?

41:27.818 --> 41:29.185
Oh god!

41:33.824 --> 41:35.225
Is he dead?

41:35.227 --> 41:36.559
He is with me.

41:36.561 --> 41:38.094
He has always been with me.

41:38.096 --> 41:39.128
For we are eternal.

41:39.130 --> 41:40.864
Let him go!

41:40.866 --> 41:43.166
You do not command me.

41:43.168 --> 41:47.604
I am no simple flesh eating
ghoul from your pathetic realm.

41:48.639 --> 41:50.874
Release me from this spell.

41:50.876 --> 41:52.642
I, I can't release you,

41:52.644 --> 41:54.744
there's nothing turned on.

41:54.746 --> 41:56.646
You shouldn't be here.

41:58.649 --> 41:59.816
Help me get this thing down!

41:59.818 --> 42:01.885
He's already gone,
we got to leave!

42:01.887 --> 42:02.919
C'mon!

42:02.921 --> 42:03.786
Oh shit, oh shit!

42:03.788 --> 42:05.255
He's behind me!

42:06.257 --> 42:07.257
Run!

42:10.795 --> 42:13.162
I am no
simple flesh eating ghoul

42:13.164 --> 42:15.865
from your pathetic realm.

42:30.247 --> 42:32.682
Hey, what's up?

42:32.684 --> 42:33.550
Hey.

42:33.552 --> 42:34.717
How's the city?

42:34.719 --> 42:36.653
I saw you were online.

42:36.655 --> 42:37.854
You got a minute?

42:37.856 --> 42:39.856
Yeah, I'm just
doing some studying.

42:39.858 --> 42:41.057
Everything okay?

42:41.059 --> 42:42.592
Yeah, everything's
going alright.

42:42.594 --> 42:43.693
I just wanted to
ask you a question

42:43.695 --> 42:46.229
since you're practically
a doctor now.

42:46.231 --> 42:49.599
Shoot, and don't
leave out any details.

42:49.601 --> 42:52.101
Well, that's the
thing, not much to tell.

42:52.103 --> 42:53.870
Except that I've been
having these blackouts

42:53.872 --> 42:56.272
for the past 10 days,
every single night.

42:56.274 --> 42:59.676
I can't remember going
to bed or coming home.

42:59.678 --> 43:01.811
And these nights you're
going out are you drinking?

43:01.813 --> 43:04.213
Yeah, Sindy's in a party mode.

43:04.215 --> 43:08.184
So, she wants to go
out every single night.

43:08.186 --> 43:11.187
I don't wanna be
rude, so, I go along.

43:11.189 --> 43:13.189
Or doing any drugs?

43:13.191 --> 43:14.924
No, of course not.

43:16.160 --> 43:17.627
That's the weird thing,

43:17.629 --> 43:20.263
is that on the nights
that I'm staying home

43:20.265 --> 43:22.832
I don't remember going to bed.

43:22.834 --> 43:26.970
And I've been tired and I'm
having trouble concentrating.

43:26.972 --> 43:29.272
I don't know, I just
don't feel right.

43:29.274 --> 43:31.608
Okay, and no sexsomnia?

43:32.710 --> 43:33.610
I'm sorry, any what?

43:33.612 --> 43:34.612
Sexsomnia?

43:35.312 --> 43:36.646
Sexsomnia.

43:36.648 --> 43:38.715
It's like sleep
walking, but sleep sex,

43:38.717 --> 43:42.919
you just don't remember
it like sleep walking.

43:42.921 --> 43:46.990
No, no sexsomnia
between Sindy and I.

43:46.992 --> 43:50.960
But, how would I even
know if I don't remember?

43:52.029 --> 43:53.296
You're making it up.

43:53.298 --> 43:56.966
I'm not, I swear,
it's a legit condition.

43:56.968 --> 43:57.834
Google it.

43:57.836 --> 43:58.868
Google it.

43:58.870 --> 44:00.069
Sexsomnia,

44:00.071 --> 44:01.871
okay, please.

44:01.873 --> 44:03.673
Look, the nights you
are having blackouts

44:03.675 --> 44:06.009
and you're not drinking those
could be a cause for concern

44:06.011 --> 44:09.112
if they do continue, but
lack of sleep from going out,

44:09.114 --> 44:12.148
fatigue and stress they
could be the cause of those.

44:12.150 --> 44:15.385
The nights you are drinking
and you're having blackouts,

44:15.387 --> 44:17.820
I would definitely say
that's the alcohol.

44:17.822 --> 44:20.923
We metabolize it a little
differently when we get older,

44:20.925 --> 44:22.025
and you could be just
a lot more sensitive

44:22.027 --> 44:24.027
to the effects of it.

44:24.962 --> 44:27.296
That could be part of it.

44:28.165 --> 44:29.932
Is everything else okay?

44:29.934 --> 44:31.901
You and Sindy good?

44:31.903 --> 44:33.269
You still a couple?

44:33.271 --> 44:35.938
We're still a couple, yeah.

44:35.940 --> 44:37.874
Alright, I'm just saying.

44:37.876 --> 44:39.342
I'm gonna be a doctor soon.

44:39.344 --> 44:43.780
So, let me know if you plan
on switching sides again.

44:48.018 --> 44:49.719
Is everything else okay?

44:49.721 --> 44:50.953
I have this video on my phone

44:50.955 --> 44:52.855
from the other night
when we went out.

44:52.857 --> 44:55.191
From one of the nights
you don't remember?

44:55.193 --> 44:58.861
Yeah, and I'm doing
things and saying things

44:58.863 --> 44:59.996
that aren't me.

45:01.231 --> 45:02.932
Crazy stuff.

45:02.934 --> 45:04.167
You know they say that's why
they call liquor "spirits",

45:04.169 --> 45:07.370
because the crazy stuff
you do when you're drunk

45:07.372 --> 45:10.840
is because you were
possessed by spirits.

45:10.842 --> 45:13.142
That sounds like some religious
crap my parents would say.

45:13.144 --> 45:16.979
Sorry, I know
that's why you left.

45:16.981 --> 45:20.883
But I was doing some
really weird and scary stuff.

45:20.885 --> 45:23.853
I mean, I moved
out here to be wild

45:26.090 --> 45:28.458
and grow and be
normal and break away

45:28.460 --> 45:30.393
from all that
embedded church stuff,

45:30.395 --> 45:32.161
but not like that.

45:35.899 --> 45:36.899
Hold on.

45:40.071 --> 45:44.273
Spirit comes from the
Latin word Spiritus

45:44.275 --> 45:48.344
which means breath and also
the essence of something.

45:48.346 --> 45:50.813
Alcohol comes from the
Arabic word al-kuhl,

45:50.815 --> 45:54.884
which is a flesh eating
monster that feeds on the dead.

45:54.886 --> 45:57.520
Al-kuhl also became
the English word ghoul

45:57.522 --> 45:59.322
which is an evil
flesh-eating demon

45:59.324 --> 46:04.160
that can influence or posses
weak-minded individuals.

46:04.162 --> 46:07.130
Well miss ghoul,
I would just say

46:07.132 --> 46:08.297
lay off the liquor,

46:08.299 --> 46:09.465
and get a good nights sleep

46:09.467 --> 46:11.033
and you should be okay.

46:11.035 --> 46:12.201
Sindy's home.

46:12.203 --> 46:13.035
I'll call you tomorrow.

46:13.037 --> 46:14.003
Alright, be good.

46:14.005 --> 46:15.104
And take care of yourself.

46:15.106 --> 46:17.106
I will, thanks again.

46:18.375 --> 46:19.842
Hey.

46:19.844 --> 46:20.844
Hey.

46:22.012 --> 46:23.412
Who you talking to?

46:23.414 --> 46:25.815
Alec, my friend from back home.

46:25.817 --> 46:27.450
I told you about him.

46:28.952 --> 46:31.420
Does Alec maybe want to come,

46:31.422 --> 46:33.089
visit us?

46:33.091 --> 46:36.993
I don't wanna hook-up with
him or anyone right now.

46:36.995 --> 46:39.362
This is all really new to me.

46:39.364 --> 46:42.832
You mean being
with me, a woman?

46:42.834 --> 46:44.233
Yeah.

46:44.235 --> 46:47.970
And I know that we're
still into guys, but,

46:47.972 --> 46:51.207
I just wanna be with
you and only you.

46:52.109 --> 46:54.043
Is it possible that
we can go out drinking

46:54.045 --> 46:56.279
like two, three times a week,

46:56.281 --> 46:58.447
like normal people?

46:58.449 --> 47:00.249
Like normal people?

47:01.251 --> 47:02.251
Listen.

47:04.888 --> 47:07.456
Do you remember when
you called me up

47:07.458 --> 47:08.891
and you wanted to come out here

47:08.893 --> 47:10.827
and you said that
you wanted to be

47:10.829 --> 47:13.262
exactly the opposite of that
good little Christian girl

47:13.264 --> 47:14.463
that your parents raised?

47:14.465 --> 47:15.832
Do you remember that?

47:15.834 --> 47:16.834
Hey!

47:18.001 --> 47:19.068
Of course.

47:21.371 --> 47:26.108
We're making great money
doing the cam show, aren't we?

47:26.110 --> 47:27.210
Yes.

47:29.613 --> 47:32.481
And who taught you that?

47:32.483 --> 47:34.083
You did.

47:34.085 --> 47:35.418
That's right.

47:38.288 --> 47:39.355
So trust me.

47:41.024 --> 47:43.159
I know what's best for you.

47:45.062 --> 47:48.231
Before we get the
cam show going, um,

47:49.132 --> 47:50.366
I want you to get
one of the guys

47:50.368 --> 47:53.536
to do something
outrageous first.

47:53.538 --> 47:54.537
Like what?

47:54.539 --> 47:55.972
Why?

47:55.974 --> 47:59.375
Trust me, this is
part of me teaching you

48:00.911 --> 48:05.114
how to get what you want
and not be such a pushover.

48:07.352 --> 48:09.619
You know what'd be hot?

48:09.621 --> 48:11.320
If you got him to

48:13.590 --> 48:15.591
cut himself a little.

48:15.593 --> 48:16.593
Ew, why?

48:17.427 --> 48:20.062
Because it would turn me on

48:20.064 --> 48:21.264
and the fact that
you just said ew

48:21.266 --> 48:24.166
means we're definitely
doing it now.

48:24.168 --> 48:27.136
Lets go get dressed up
and ready for our show

48:27.138 --> 48:29.238
and make a quick
thousand dollars,

48:29.240 --> 48:33.075
and go out and party
like rock stars, okay?

48:38.515 --> 48:39.348
Hi Zack.

48:39.350 --> 48:41.017
Hey Caitlin.

48:41.019 --> 48:42.019
Hey Rick.

48:43.287 --> 48:45.221
Jerry, looking good.

48:48.358 --> 48:49.692
Jim, what's up?

48:51.929 --> 48:52.929
And Zoe.

48:54.231 --> 48:57.633
Guys, we have a hottie
watching with us.

48:59.069 --> 49:02.171
And finally Eric, right on time.

49:02.173 --> 49:04.507
I'm packin' and
ready for action!

49:04.509 --> 49:06.242
Woooo!

49:06.244 --> 49:08.377
Where's your friend, lets
get this 'ho on the road.

49:08.379 --> 49:10.012
She's coming.

49:10.014 --> 49:11.347
You know the rules Eric,

49:11.349 --> 49:14.050
Sindy will pick who we're
giving the free show for,

49:14.052 --> 49:16.352
but no talking while we wait.

49:17.487 --> 49:20.356
Ooh, Sindy with
an s, I like that.

49:20.358 --> 49:24.226
Shut up dude, she
said no talking.

49:24.228 --> 49:26.095
Hi everybody!

49:26.097 --> 49:29.565
Alright, I'm ready to go Hans
solo on Darth Vader's head,

49:29.567 --> 49:31.634
got my lube right here...

49:32.636 --> 49:34.036
that's what happens
when you don't

49:34.038 --> 49:36.706
play by the rules everyone.

49:36.708 --> 49:40.309
Oh, we got a girl as
a finalist tonight.

49:42.245 --> 49:44.113
We both like girls.

49:47.617 --> 49:50.453
Hey, who's the
one in the corner,

49:51.989 --> 49:54.323
you, not paying attention
to two beautiful women

49:54.325 --> 49:56.125
here for his pleasure?

49:56.127 --> 49:57.360
Jim.

49:57.362 --> 49:58.362
Jim.

49:59.229 --> 50:00.329
Jim.

50:01.264 --> 50:02.598
Hey look at me.

50:03.734 --> 50:05.401
Yeah.

50:05.403 --> 50:07.670
We are going to
give one lucky winner

50:07.672 --> 50:09.638
the show of a lifetime.

50:11.008 --> 50:13.376
We're going to do everything,

50:13.378 --> 50:15.277
and I mean everything.

50:17.247 --> 50:18.748
So keep watching.

50:36.299 --> 50:37.299
That one.

50:38.268 --> 50:39.668
He's our winner.

50:40.771 --> 50:43.139
Everyone else, so
nice seeing you again.

50:43.141 --> 50:45.041
Better luck next time.

50:48.412 --> 50:50.312
Okay guys, and Zoey.

50:51.448 --> 50:54.417
I'll be back on cam tomorrow
night my normal time.

50:54.419 --> 50:57.753
And if you want a one
on one, just message me.

50:57.755 --> 50:58.755
Bye!

51:00.190 --> 51:04.326
Stay right there Jerry,
I'll be back in a minute.

51:06.730 --> 51:08.164
Jerry.

51:08.166 --> 51:10.466
Hi, I guess I'm
the winner, huh?

51:11.368 --> 51:13.469
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.

51:15.305 --> 51:17.506
You are in for a treat.

51:18.675 --> 51:21.710
I'm really glad
that she chose you.

51:21.712 --> 51:25.114
Wanna know why I'm
glad she chose you?

51:25.116 --> 51:26.116
Jerry?

51:27.250 --> 51:28.217
Ahh, sorry.

51:28.219 --> 51:29.717
What were you saying?

51:29.719 --> 51:32.221
Do you wanna know why I'm
glad that she choose you?

51:32.223 --> 51:33.223
Okay.

51:34.724 --> 51:36.592
You're different.

51:36.594 --> 51:38.694
You're not like the other guys.

51:38.696 --> 51:42.865
You let me be myself,
you don't rush me,

51:42.867 --> 51:45.434
you let me do what I wanna do,

51:45.436 --> 51:48.804
touch myself how I
wanna touch myself.

51:48.806 --> 51:51.474
You don't make demands of me.

51:52.375 --> 51:54.477
I really enjoy my time with you.

51:54.479 --> 51:55.778
I'm sorry, there's some,

51:55.780 --> 51:59.482
like, interference or
something going on.

51:59.484 --> 52:00.583
What do you mean?

52:00.585 --> 52:03.152
Uhhh, it's gone now.

52:03.154 --> 52:04.453
That was weird.

52:05.789 --> 52:07.423
You want weird,

52:07.425 --> 52:09.558
you should hear what some
of the other guys want.

52:09.560 --> 52:11.760
They can be really
persistent about it.

52:11.762 --> 52:13.229
Yeah, I bet.

52:13.231 --> 52:16.332
That Eric guy was kinda rude.

52:16.334 --> 52:18.434
I can tell you're
a good person.

52:18.436 --> 52:21.770
That's what makes me
wanna know more about you.

52:21.772 --> 52:25.541
I'm curious to see what the
rest of your place looks like.

52:25.543 --> 52:27.776
Give me a tour of
Jerry's castle.

52:27.778 --> 52:28.844
Right now?

52:30.180 --> 52:33.449
Yeah, Sindy will be
back in a few minutes.

52:34.518 --> 52:37.153
I wanna see where I sent
those care packages.

52:37.155 --> 52:38.521
Well, I could switch
over to my cell phone

52:38.523 --> 52:39.488
and do that I guess.

52:39.490 --> 52:41.524
Perfect, let's see.

52:42.359 --> 52:44.326
Okay hold on.

52:48.298 --> 52:49.598
So that's,

52:49.600 --> 52:53.469
uh, my front door, where
people come in and I go out.

52:55.272 --> 52:57.540
That's uh, that's my kitchen.

52:58.742 --> 53:00.442
I sometimes cook.

53:01.545 --> 53:03.312
Let's see your bedroom Jerry.

53:03.314 --> 53:04.580
Yeah, yeah, sure,

53:04.582 --> 53:07.416
we have to backtrack,
so hold on.

53:10.854 --> 53:13.222
There's the living room,

53:13.224 --> 53:15.925
and we got to go
down the hallway.

53:18.662 --> 53:21.263
There's the bathroom, sorry.

53:23.867 --> 53:25.868
And then, there's the bedroom.

53:25.870 --> 53:28.370
That's it, nothing special.

53:43.920 --> 53:44.920
Okay.

53:45.922 --> 53:48.424
Alright, that's it.

53:48.426 --> 53:49.658
Nothing special.

53:49.660 --> 53:50.960
Very nice Jerry.

53:50.962 --> 53:53.629
Thanks for showing me around.

53:53.631 --> 53:54.964
No problem.

53:54.966 --> 53:56.699
I didn't know I was gonna
be giving a tour, though

53:56.701 --> 54:00.569
so excuse the mess.

54:00.571 --> 54:01.837
That's a very nice bachelor pad

54:01.839 --> 54:04.940
that you have all to yourself.

54:04.942 --> 54:07.943
You like me a lot
Jerry, don't you?

54:08.745 --> 54:09.745
Yeah.

54:11.248 --> 54:13.049
Do you wanna do something
for me that would,

54:15.652 --> 54:16.819
what is it?

54:19.723 --> 54:20.956
Ummm, sorry.

54:21.858 --> 54:23.025
It's a little kinky.

54:23.027 --> 54:24.526
Go get a big kitchen
knife for me.

54:24.528 --> 54:26.695
I'll be waiting right
here when you get back.

54:26.697 --> 54:29.898
I have a pocket knife
in my desk, is that okay?

54:29.900 --> 54:30.899
Even better.

54:30.901 --> 54:32.501
Okay, hold on.

54:39.609 --> 54:41.977
It's got to be here somewhere.

54:45.649 --> 54:47.449
Very good Jerry.

54:47.451 --> 54:49.985
Like this, is that okay?

54:49.987 --> 54:51.487
You know what
would be really hot

54:51.489 --> 54:54.857
if you could do a
little something for me.

54:56.359 --> 54:58.394
Okay, what do
you want me to do?

54:58.396 --> 55:00.296
I have this fetish,

55:00.298 --> 55:03.565
if you could just
take that knife and,

55:03.567 --> 55:05.968
cut your hand a
little bit for me.

55:05.970 --> 55:08.570
I don't know about that...

55:08.572 --> 55:12.741
Jerry, it would turn
me and Sindy on so much.

55:14.377 --> 55:16.578
No guy has ever
done this for me.

55:16.580 --> 55:18.414
I want you to be the first.

55:18.416 --> 55:19.615
Okay I'll try.

55:28.792 --> 55:31.660
I'm sorry, I can't, it'll hurt.

55:32.629 --> 55:34.763
Jerry baby, look at me.

55:36.599 --> 55:38.767
Put that knife on your hand
and cut yourself for me,

55:38.769 --> 55:40.536
just a little bit.

55:56.720 --> 55:58.821
Kinda liked doing that.

56:04.394 --> 56:05.527
Do you wanna be with me?

56:05.529 --> 56:06.362
I do.

56:06.364 --> 56:07.364
Really be with me?

56:08.466 --> 56:10.899
I know of a way we can
be together, for real.

56:10.901 --> 56:11.867
You would like
that, wouldn't you?

56:11.869 --> 56:13.135
Me, you, and Sindy,

56:13.137 --> 56:15.571
the three of us to be together?

56:15.573 --> 56:16.638
Of course.

56:18.475 --> 56:21.043
You would do anything
for me, wouldn't you?

56:21.045 --> 56:22.045
I would.

56:23.480 --> 56:26.515
I just need you to do one
more thing for me, okay?

56:26.517 --> 56:27.517
Okay.

56:28.752 --> 56:32.821
I want you to take the knife
and cut your throat open.

56:32.823 --> 56:33.823
What?

56:34.991 --> 56:38.927
Jerry, we'll be together,
forever, I promise.

56:38.929 --> 56:39.995
Do it for me.

56:39.997 --> 56:41.563
I don't wanna do that!

56:41.565 --> 56:43.732
Why would you want
me to cut my throat?

56:43.734 --> 56:46.668
Baby, because you
want me and I want you.

56:46.670 --> 56:47.870
You can do this.

56:50.006 --> 56:51.140
You know this is the only way.

56:51.142 --> 56:52.574
No!

56:52.576 --> 56:55.511
Please, we'll be
together, I promise.

56:58.515 --> 56:59.515
I don't feel well.

56:59.517 --> 57:00.682
I know, I know.

57:00.684 --> 57:03.685
It'll be over
before you know it.

57:04.654 --> 57:05.487
No!

57:05.489 --> 57:06.522
No!

57:06.524 --> 57:07.723
I don't want to die.

57:07.725 --> 57:08.657
Jerry!

57:08.659 --> 57:09.958
Please don't make me do this.

57:09.960 --> 57:13.896
Jerry, take that knife
and slit your throat.

57:20.437 --> 57:21.670
Very good,

57:21.672 --> 57:24.673
do it for me baby,
you're doing great.

57:30.648 --> 57:33.882
You were so close,
baby, lets try again.

57:35.986 --> 57:37.953
Jerry, baby look at me.

57:39.155 --> 57:40.923
Jerry, look at me!

57:43.860 --> 57:45.794
You're doing great.

57:45.796 --> 57:47.996
Just do as I do okay, ready?

57:47.998 --> 57:49.631
No!

57:49.633 --> 57:51.733
Please, don't make me.

57:51.735 --> 57:52.835
So close.

57:52.837 --> 57:54.837
I don't wanna die.

57:54.839 --> 57:55.804
We'll be together soon.

57:55.806 --> 57:56.839
I don't wanna...

57:56.841 --> 57:57.841
do it for me.

58:19.262 --> 58:23.899
My lord, I know our great
father two centuries ago

58:23.901 --> 58:27.102
forbid us to kill
humans for consumption.

58:27.104 --> 58:28.637
And I know that he forbid us

58:28.639 --> 58:31.707
to rob their graves
and mortuaries.

58:31.709 --> 58:34.943
But he said nothing
of feasting on a human

58:34.945 --> 58:39.114
that has taken its own
life in his own residence.

58:41.251 --> 58:45.687
I present to you this offering
of untainted human flesh

58:46.823 --> 58:48.790
on the anniversary
that you saved me

58:48.792 --> 58:51.126
from the archangel Raphael.

58:53.830 --> 58:56.532
My child, you please me so.

58:58.935 --> 59:02.971
It only took you 10 days to
control your new host body.

59:04.774 --> 59:08.010
This is cause for celebration.

59:08.012 --> 59:12.247
In ancient times we would
have a great feast for days.

59:18.955 --> 59:22.291
I have been trapped in
this form for too long,

59:22.293 --> 59:26.194
my natural urgings
stripped away from me.

59:26.196 --> 59:30.632
I have been hungry and
unsatisfied all these years.

59:32.035 --> 59:35.871
You have done a great
service to your lord.

59:37.006 --> 59:40.909
This pathetic creature was
so easy to put into a trance,

59:49.285 --> 59:52.054
and give up his own free will.

59:52.956 --> 59:54.923
Come my child, join me.

59:58.828 --> 01:00:02.197
Partake for the first
time in human flesh.

01:00:39.936 --> 01:00:42.004
Nicole.

01:00:42.006 --> 01:00:43.205
Nicole, wake up.

01:00:45.908 --> 01:00:46.908
Martin?

01:00:49.379 --> 01:00:52.914
Nicole, I need you
to keep rolling the camera.

01:00:52.916 --> 01:00:53.914
Okay.

01:00:53.916 --> 01:00:56.885
It's very important
that we capture everything.

01:00:56.887 --> 01:00:58.286
Oh my god, Jason!

01:01:06.029 --> 01:01:07.129
Jason!

01:01:07.997 --> 01:01:08.830
Jason, wake up.

01:01:08.832 --> 01:01:09.965
Are you okay?

01:01:11.267 --> 01:01:12.701
Jason wake up.

01:01:16.439 --> 01:01:18.040
What happened?

01:01:18.941 --> 01:01:21.977
Hold on, hold on, hold on man.

01:01:21.979 --> 01:01:26.248
I saw that thing with its
tentacles down your throat.

01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:28.283
I thought you were dead!

01:01:28.285 --> 01:01:30.085
You saw it too, right?

01:01:30.087 --> 01:01:31.286
You saw it too?

01:01:31.288 --> 01:01:33.221
There's not a mark on you!

01:01:33.223 --> 01:01:35.023
I don't have an
answer for that.

01:01:35.025 --> 01:01:39.294
I think I know why we
can't open the door,

01:01:39.296 --> 01:01:42.297
why the cell phones
aren't working.

01:01:43.433 --> 01:01:44.866
Yeah?

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:47.402
Well go on Einstein,
what's going on?

01:01:49.906 --> 01:01:52.874
When our equipment
malfunctioned,

01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:57.379
instead of the entity
coming to our dilation,

01:01:58.848 --> 01:02:00.449
oh my god.

01:02:02.118 --> 01:02:04.152
We went to its dilation.

01:02:06.089 --> 01:02:08.088
Therefore everything
we perceived,

01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:11.760
everything that's happened over
the last several minutes is,

01:02:11.762 --> 01:02:15.997
just a fraction of the one
second in the real world for us.

01:02:18.067 --> 01:02:20.969
I only got a b
in algebra, okay?

01:02:20.971 --> 01:02:24.005
So you two have fun discussing
whatever you're gonna do,

01:02:24.007 --> 01:02:26.007
and I'm gonna break
down that door.

01:02:26.009 --> 01:02:27.109
Jason, stop it's
not going to work!

01:02:27.111 --> 01:02:28.111
Why?

01:02:29.345 --> 01:02:31.880
Because we're in a bubble.

01:02:31.882 --> 01:02:33.782
There's a bubble that's
centered somewhere on this bed,

01:02:33.784 --> 01:02:35.217
and it goes somewhere out here.

01:02:35.219 --> 01:02:36.785
It is continually
expanding and contracting

01:02:36.787 --> 01:02:38.253
and we don't know
where that line is.

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:41.990
That's why when you go over
there, you don't hear any sound.

01:02:41.992 --> 01:02:43.792
You bang on the door,
there's no sound.

01:02:43.794 --> 01:02:47.395
When you walk, you don't
hear your footsteps.

01:02:48.898 --> 01:02:49.898
Okay, so.

01:02:51.367 --> 01:02:52.367
Look.

01:02:57.907 --> 01:02:59.141
What do you see?

01:02:59.143 --> 01:03:01.209
It's the feed outside,

01:03:03.346 --> 01:03:06.882
it must be frozen,
the frame is frozen.

01:03:08.317 --> 01:03:10.085
It's not frozen.

01:03:11.854 --> 01:03:14.990
That's the time
dilation outside.

01:03:14.992 --> 01:03:17.225
That's where we came from.

01:03:19.128 --> 01:03:21.263
Get me out of this place!

01:03:22.431 --> 01:03:24.399
So we're like ghosts?

01:03:25.434 --> 01:03:27.869
No one can see or hear us?

01:03:29.272 --> 01:03:31.807
Can we reverse
this time dilation?

01:03:31.809 --> 01:03:34.109
Yeah, yeah, let's just do that,

01:03:34.111 --> 01:03:35.177
let's just reverse it, right,

01:03:35.179 --> 01:03:37.512
that's what we need to do.

01:03:37.514 --> 01:03:39.114
Everything is,

01:03:40.016 --> 01:03:42.015
centered around the bed.

01:03:42.017 --> 01:03:45.120
If you go to the bed,
I think that's okay.

01:03:45.122 --> 01:03:49.024
If I put in the right
settings, it might work.

01:03:50.393 --> 01:03:51.393
Yeah.

01:03:52.995 --> 01:03:54.162
No wait wait, hold on,

01:03:54.164 --> 01:03:55.964
the Spectre camera, hold on.

01:03:55.966 --> 01:03:56.598
No!

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:57.432
No, Jason, wait!

01:03:57.434 --> 01:03:59.201
Don't cross the line!

01:04:01.137 --> 01:04:02.337
Uh, I'm stuck.

01:04:06.409 --> 01:04:08.009
So sorry.

01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:08.844
Sorry?

01:04:08.846 --> 01:04:11.179
Martin, why am I stuck?

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:12.347
It's burning.

01:04:16.586 --> 01:04:17.853
I don't...

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:35.036
Nicole, I need
you to listen to me.

01:04:36.273 --> 01:04:37.138
I just...

01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:38.573
Nicole.

01:04:38.575 --> 01:04:39.574
Nicole, Nicole stop.

01:04:39.576 --> 01:04:41.109
I need you to listen to me.

01:04:41.111 --> 01:04:43.245
You have to keep filming.

01:04:44.647 --> 01:04:47.415
When that thing put its
tentacles in my head,

01:04:47.417 --> 01:04:48.984
I saw, I saw,

01:04:48.986 --> 01:04:50.051
everything that it saw.

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:51.286
I could feel it,

01:04:51.288 --> 01:04:52.621
I could think everything
that it was thinking.

01:04:52.623 --> 01:04:54.589
It's very scared and
it's not scared of us,

01:04:54.591 --> 01:04:56.992
it's scared of something
else that is out there.

01:04:56.994 --> 01:04:59.127
Every time we turn this thing
on Nicole, every time we do,

01:04:59.129 --> 01:05:00.996
it sends a signal out
into the universe.

01:05:00.998 --> 01:05:02.931
Some kind of beacon, some sign,

01:05:02.933 --> 01:05:04.165
and we don't know
what's getting it.

01:05:04.167 --> 01:05:06.034
Anything could be getting that.

01:05:06.036 --> 01:05:07.435
Whatever is coming our way

01:05:07.437 --> 01:05:12.040
is far scarier than anything
we're dealing with right now.

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:18.613
It's very scared and
it's not scared of us,

01:05:18.615 --> 01:05:21.016
it's scared of something
else that is out there.

01:05:21.018 --> 01:05:22.217
It sends a signal out
into the universe,

01:05:22.219 --> 01:05:24.185
some kind of beacon.

01:05:24.187 --> 01:05:26.154
Whatever is coming
our way is far scarier

01:05:26.156 --> 01:05:30.225
than anything that we're
dealing with right now.

01:05:36.332 --> 01:05:38.066
My name is Amanda Cortney.

01:05:38.068 --> 01:05:42.237
I'm of sound mind and
relatively good health.

01:05:42.239 --> 01:05:43.239
I've been,

01:05:43.973 --> 01:05:45.640
for lack of a better term,

01:05:45.642 --> 01:05:47.175
kidnapped.

01:05:47.177 --> 01:05:48.276
I remember.

01:05:48.278 --> 01:05:51.112
I remember flashes
here and there.

01:05:51.114 --> 01:05:52.647
They do things that,

01:05:55.318 --> 01:05:57.152
I don't wanna talk about it.

01:05:57.154 --> 01:05:58.620
And trust me, if
they did them to you,

01:05:58.622 --> 01:06:01.256
you wouldn't wanna
talk about them either.

01:06:01.258 --> 01:06:04.125
The physical stuff, I can take.

01:06:05.428 --> 01:06:08.263
My mind, my emotions, my being,

01:06:09.031 --> 01:06:11.266
that, they can't have.

01:06:11.268 --> 01:06:13.101
But I realized something.

01:06:13.103 --> 01:06:16.638
And now I know, I can
beat these mother fu...

01:06:21.610 --> 01:06:25.313
welcome to our end
of grad school blowout.

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:26.982
My name's Ryan,

01:06:26.984 --> 01:06:30.352
and I'll be your host for
tonight's festivities.

01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:34.622
Wanna give me the
first testimonial,

01:06:34.624 --> 01:06:36.391
I'll show this to
everyone years from now

01:06:36.393 --> 01:06:38.493
when we're all fat and old.

01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:41.696
My testimonial Ryan,

01:06:41.698 --> 01:06:44.366
is that you should de-nerd
yourself for your own party.

01:06:44.368 --> 01:06:46.634
There are a ton
of hot girls here.

01:06:46.636 --> 01:06:47.469
I have,

01:06:47.471 --> 01:06:48.403
excuse me dude,

01:06:48.405 --> 01:06:50.205
I have a testimonial as well.

01:06:50.207 --> 01:06:53.008
Ashley and I hooked
up last week.

01:06:54.543 --> 01:06:55.477
We did not.

01:06:55.479 --> 01:06:56.411
Yes we did, yes we did.

01:06:56.413 --> 01:06:59.080
Dude, we hooked up alright,

01:06:59.082 --> 01:07:00.281
you loved it and you know it.

01:07:00.283 --> 01:07:01.349
Hey, what's up?

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:03.284
I like this, party
people having fun,

01:07:03.286 --> 01:07:04.119
what's up?

01:07:04.121 --> 01:07:05.186
Ryan?

01:07:05.188 --> 01:07:06.521
Oh no, no, I'm Josh, I'm Josh.

01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:10.258
Josh, sorry man, I
get you guys confused.

01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:11.526
Stop doing that, dude!

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:13.595
You guys are disgusting.

01:07:15.231 --> 01:07:16.164
Funny face,

01:07:16.166 --> 01:07:18.333
you wanna give a testimonial?

01:07:18.335 --> 01:07:20.368
Get the camera out of my face.

01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:21.236
Are you serious?

01:07:21.238 --> 01:07:22.470
I'm serious.

01:07:22.605 --> 01:07:23.339
What's up?

01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:25.340
I have something
really serious things

01:07:25.342 --> 01:07:26.374
to talk to you about.

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:27.374
What's up dude?

01:07:27.376 --> 01:07:29.344
I'm just kidding, I
don't have anything to say.

01:07:29.346 --> 01:07:31.046
And so, I don't now.

01:07:31.048 --> 01:07:32.447
If you're into practicing
the same things,

01:07:32.449 --> 01:07:35.183
we can practice things together.

01:07:35.763 --> 01:07:36.252
Sorry.

01:07:36.253 --> 01:07:38.520
You said Amanda never
has more than one drink.

01:07:38.522 --> 01:07:39.788
Never, no.

01:07:39.790 --> 01:07:40.788
So she's probably
not the kind of girl

01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:42.290
who would be hooking up with
two guys at the same time?

01:07:42.292 --> 01:07:43.525
What are you talking about?

01:07:43.527 --> 01:07:44.325
I think I just saw
these two douche bags

01:07:44.327 --> 01:07:45.627
drag her into your room.

01:07:45.629 --> 01:07:46.494
Take this!

01:07:46.496 --> 01:07:47.495
Excuse me.

01:07:47.497 --> 01:07:48.497
Sorry.

01:07:49.465 --> 01:07:50.298
Watch out.

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:51.300
Hey!

01:07:51.768 --> 01:07:53.201
Open the door!

01:07:54.503 --> 01:07:55.804
Hey whoa, whoa!

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:04.712
Dude, you're like a
bearded Rhonda Rousey.

01:08:08.784 --> 01:08:11.419
Amanda still passed out?

01:08:11.421 --> 01:08:15.256
Those roofie loving
molester mother,

01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:17.459
yeah, she's totally crashed.

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:28.502
Dude, I don't know,
I'm just thinking

01:08:28.505 --> 01:08:29.804
maybe you shouldn't
start taping her

01:08:29.805 --> 01:08:31.872
as soon as she wakes up.

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:37.178
We need to get whatever she
remembers on tape right away.

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:38.846
She might press charges,

01:08:38.849 --> 01:08:40.747
those guys might press
charges against us

01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:41.649
for beating them up,

01:08:41.651 --> 01:08:43.151
you don't know.

01:08:44.752 --> 01:08:46.453
Amanda, you okay?

01:08:51.493 --> 01:08:53.694
The things they did to me.

01:08:55.698 --> 01:08:57.899
The things they did to me.

01:08:59.902 --> 01:09:01.870
Why would they do that?

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:04.506
Why would they do that to me?

01:09:04.508 --> 01:09:05.540
Don't touch me!

01:09:05.542 --> 01:09:06.374
Don't touch me!

01:09:06.376 --> 01:09:07.207
Don't touch me!

01:09:07.210 --> 01:09:07.841
Don't touch me!

01:09:07.844 --> 01:09:09.511
Don't touch me!

01:09:14.416 --> 01:09:16.885
That must've been
at least a 6.0 quake.

01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:18.553
Amanda, you okay?

01:09:19.889 --> 01:09:20.889
Amanda?

01:09:22.323 --> 01:09:26.394
Guys, why don't you help
me get her to Josh's bedroom.

01:09:28.531 --> 01:09:29.531
Ryan.

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:42.477
One of the many
large shards of glass

01:09:42.479 --> 01:09:44.444
I'm finding all
over my house now,

01:09:44.447 --> 01:09:46.548
which is just really great.

01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:47.515
You guys,

01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:50.718
I just looked it up to see
how big that earthquake was,

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.520
and there's no report
of an earthquake.

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:54.923
Nobody else felt it.

01:09:54.925 --> 01:09:57.225
Power surge or something maybe?

01:09:57.227 --> 01:10:00.828
A power surge wouldn't make
the whole building shake.

01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:02.497
Look, look out here,

01:10:02.499 --> 01:10:03.865
everything's fine.

01:10:10.839 --> 01:10:13.441
What is there to
eat around here?

01:10:13.443 --> 01:10:16.211
You guys didn't eat
everything, did you?

01:10:16.213 --> 01:10:18.947
Man, I passed out last night,

01:10:18.949 --> 01:10:19.949
I'm starving.

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:24.252
What's the
last thing you remember?

01:10:24.254 --> 01:10:25.386
Ummmm,

01:10:25.388 --> 01:10:27.689
I was talking to some guy.

01:10:27.691 --> 01:10:30.825
I had the weirdest
dreams last night.

01:10:33.762 --> 01:10:35.296
What?

01:10:35.298 --> 01:10:37.298
Am I missing something?

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:46.808
Hey, what's up?

01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:47.842
How are you?

01:10:47.844 --> 01:10:49.577
I'm alright.

01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:52.547
Sorry about the
video call, my phone,

01:10:52.549 --> 01:10:54.015
it's all messed up.

01:10:55.551 --> 01:10:57.352
No worries.

01:10:57.354 --> 01:10:59.020
How are your grandparents?

01:10:59.022 --> 01:11:01.522
They're doing well.

01:11:01.524 --> 01:11:05.994
Um, you're the only person
I could talk to about this,

01:11:05.996 --> 01:11:07.695
I'm sorry to bother you.

01:11:07.697 --> 01:11:10.598
Don't be silly,
glad you called.

01:11:12.635 --> 01:11:14.736
I was just thinking
the other day,

01:11:14.738 --> 01:11:17.839
that this is the first
time since we were 12

01:11:17.841 --> 01:11:20.608
we've lived in different
cities from each other.

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:22.343
Yeah, you were my,

01:11:23.479 --> 01:11:25.613
constant all those years.

01:11:26.582 --> 01:11:27.582
So, umm,

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:31.986
I'm just gonna say it,

01:11:31.988 --> 01:11:34.656
I've seen my mom a few times.

01:11:35.924 --> 01:11:37.625
In person?

01:11:37.627 --> 01:11:38.960
Did you call the police?

01:11:38.962 --> 01:11:41.663
No, it's hard to explain, but,

01:11:41.665 --> 01:11:44.666
I can't call the police...

01:11:44.668 --> 01:11:47.468
of course you can, you have to.

01:11:48.404 --> 01:11:50.672
What did you grandparents say?

01:11:50.674 --> 01:11:51.672
I'm not telling my grandparents

01:11:51.674 --> 01:11:52.940
that I saw their daughter-in-law

01:11:52.942 --> 01:11:55.643
who went crazy and
murdered their son.

01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:58.946
Besides, they
wouldn't believe me.

01:11:58.948 --> 01:12:01.649
You're not making any sense.

01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:04.552
You need to talk to someone.

01:12:04.554 --> 01:12:06.688
I'm not sure she's
entirely responsible

01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:08.723
for everything she did.

01:12:08.725 --> 01:12:11.693
I think it's passed onto me now.

01:12:11.695 --> 01:12:13.961
What are you talking about?

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:17.098
Anyway, I'll
figure something out,

01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:17.965
I'm sorry to bother you.

01:12:17.967 --> 01:12:20.034
Don't hang up.

01:12:20.036 --> 01:12:23.705
My grandparents are
gonna be back soon.

01:12:23.707 --> 01:12:26.541
I thought it would
stop when I came here,

01:12:26.543 --> 01:12:27.742
I'll talk to you later.

01:12:27.744 --> 01:12:29.811
Amanda, wait a second.

01:12:37.753 --> 01:12:40.621
Good to see you're alive.

01:12:40.623 --> 01:12:42.090
I'm in Montana.

01:12:42.092 --> 01:12:43.725
Montana?

01:12:43.727 --> 01:12:46.627
Nearest home is
a 30 minute drive.

01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:48.062
I thought that getting
away from civilization

01:12:48.064 --> 01:12:49.931
would make it stop.

01:12:49.933 --> 01:12:53.601
It did for a bit,
but, it's worse now.

01:12:53.603 --> 01:12:57.538
Amanda, you can't
just run away from this.

01:12:58.140 --> 01:12:59.941
You need to get help.

01:12:59.943 --> 01:13:01.709
That's why I'm calling.

01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:03.711
If I come down there
next week on the 10th,

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:04.846
can I stay with you?

01:13:04.848 --> 01:13:06.714
Of course, you know that.

01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:08.616
Can Josh and
Ashley be there too,

01:13:08.618 --> 01:13:10.618
I'm gonna need all three of you.

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:14.655
I'm sure they'll both
be there if you need them.

01:13:14.657 --> 01:13:16.023
What's so funny?

01:13:17.159 --> 01:13:18.926
All three of us
are very worried,

01:13:18.928 --> 01:13:20.595
we were going to track you down

01:13:20.597 --> 01:13:22.864
and come to wherever you are.

01:13:23.932 --> 01:13:26.667
And take me away
like an intervention,

01:13:26.669 --> 01:13:27.769
kidnap me?

01:13:30.172 --> 01:13:32.073
Something like that.

01:13:34.443 --> 01:13:36.544
I should go before
we lose the connection.

01:13:36.546 --> 01:13:40.148
Wait a minute, please
don't disappear again.

01:13:40.150 --> 01:13:42.817
I promise, I'll be there soon.

01:13:42.819 --> 01:13:44.719
Really, already?

01:13:44.721 --> 01:13:45.953
Can't I just,

01:13:45.955 --> 01:13:46.788
finish my conversation?

01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:48.022
Amanda?

01:13:48.024 --> 01:13:49.557
Please, you do
this all the time.

01:13:49.559 --> 01:13:50.559
Amanda?

01:13:55.764 --> 01:13:57.632
Okay, everybody got it?

01:13:57.634 --> 01:13:59.600
Make sure the camera
is always recording

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:00.600
and most importantly...

01:14:00.602 --> 01:14:02.770
yeah yeah yeah, don't
fall asleep, we got it.

01:14:02.772 --> 01:14:04.439
Right, okay.

01:14:04.441 --> 01:14:05.206
I'm gonna be in the bedroom,

01:14:05.208 --> 01:14:06.674
and I'll leave it open

01:14:06.676 --> 01:14:09.177
so you guys can check
in on me if you want.

01:14:09.179 --> 01:14:10.745
Just record everything,

01:14:10.747 --> 01:14:12.713
and stay awake, please.

01:14:12.715 --> 01:14:15.950
Just drink coffee or do coke.

01:14:15.952 --> 01:14:18.186
None of us do
cocaine, you know that.

01:14:18.188 --> 01:14:19.720
Are you doing hard drugs?

01:14:19.722 --> 01:14:21.189
Is this what's happening?

01:14:21.191 --> 01:14:22.023
No no no no,

01:14:22.025 --> 01:14:23.458
I'm not, no.

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:24.792
Just, guys please
just do this for me.

01:14:24.794 --> 01:14:26.794
Okay, thank you.

01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:28.196
I'm gonna go to bed, alright.

01:14:28.198 --> 01:14:29.230
Good night.

01:14:29.232 --> 01:14:30.232
Thanks.

01:14:38.073 --> 01:14:40.007
Dude, you gotta
get a couch already.

01:14:40.009 --> 01:14:42.009
I told you, I'm moving
in two months for the job,

01:14:42.011 --> 01:14:43.744
what's the point.

01:14:43.746 --> 01:14:45.213
Am I the only one
that thinks it's weird

01:14:45.215 --> 01:14:49.050
that she wants to sleep in the
same bed where it happened?

01:14:49.052 --> 01:14:53.120
Maybe it's just her way
of dealing with all this.

01:14:53.122 --> 01:14:54.722
Yeah, she'll be fine.

01:14:54.724 --> 01:14:55.857
Everybody's different.

01:14:57.193 --> 01:14:58.726
Ashley,

01:14:58.728 --> 01:15:00.027
Ashley wake.

01:15:00.029 --> 01:15:02.530
Ryan, will you wake Ashley.

01:15:26.623 --> 01:15:27.255
Hey!

01:15:27.257 --> 01:15:28.089
Hey!

01:15:28.091 --> 01:15:28.923
Get up!

01:15:28.925 --> 01:15:30.258
Get the camera!

01:15:34.930 --> 01:15:36.929
Amanda, Amanda.

01:15:36.931 --> 01:15:39.267
Everything is okay,
we're here for you.

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:45.139
Well, that didn't work.

01:15:45.141 --> 01:15:46.841
Was I screaming again?

01:15:46.843 --> 01:15:49.310
Yeah, Jesus, we thought
you were dying or something.

01:15:49.312 --> 01:15:53.314
I'm sorry, I thought
I was past that part.

01:15:53.316 --> 01:15:56.183
You guys just dozed
off or something?

01:15:56.185 --> 01:15:57.618
I don't know,

01:15:57.620 --> 01:15:59.887
I just remember that
we were laying there.

01:15:59.889 --> 01:16:03.791
Don't worry about it, I
didn't think it would work.

01:16:03.793 --> 01:16:05.660
It was worth a try.

01:16:06.762 --> 01:16:09.897
Just turn the camera
off, just turn it off!

01:16:11.934 --> 01:16:14.702
Okay, the camera is all set.

01:16:16.138 --> 01:16:17.939
But, I don't really
understand why

01:16:17.941 --> 01:16:22.043
they can't see whatever
you wanna show me.

01:16:22.045 --> 01:16:23.611
Because the only
person that I care about

01:16:23.613 --> 01:16:26.147
knowing that I'm
not crazy is you.

01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:29.183
Not Ashley, not my grandparents.

01:16:29.185 --> 01:16:30.918
But for right now,

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:33.187
this is just between you
and me right now, okay?

01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:34.189
Okay.

01:16:35.857 --> 01:16:38.626
You gonna show me card tricks?

01:16:39.895 --> 01:16:40.895
Not exactly.

01:16:42.698 --> 01:16:45.633
I just needed something
that was small and light.

01:16:45.635 --> 01:16:46.934
I'm still figuring this out.

01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:47.936
Just watch.

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:14.895
That's a good trick.

01:17:14.897 --> 01:17:16.964
How are you doing that?

01:17:16.966 --> 01:17:17.965
It's not a trick.

01:17:17.967 --> 01:17:20.334
Come on, tell me how.

01:17:20.336 --> 01:17:23.871
I told you it's not a trick.

01:17:23.873 --> 01:17:25.940
Alright, so you are saying

01:17:25.942 --> 01:17:28.976
you have telekinetic
psychic powers, then?

01:17:28.978 --> 01:17:30.778
If you wanna call them that.

01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:32.680
You can move things
with your mind?

01:17:32.682 --> 01:17:33.682
Yeah.

01:17:37.352 --> 01:17:38.953
You being serious?

01:17:38.955 --> 01:17:40.788
Ryan, have I ever lied to you?

01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:41.790
Ever?

01:17:46.862 --> 01:17:47.928
Okay.

01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:50.364
So, this is still related

01:17:50.366 --> 01:17:53.701
to what happened to
you at the party?

01:17:53.703 --> 01:17:55.970
Those two guys attacked you.

01:17:55.972 --> 01:17:57.271
You suppressed all memory of it,

01:17:57.273 --> 01:18:00.441
and somehow your brain
has rewired itself

01:18:00.443 --> 01:18:03.077
to give you this ability?

01:18:03.079 --> 01:18:04.712
No.

01:18:04.714 --> 01:18:06.747
I'm not gonna tell you
what's been happening to me.

01:18:06.749 --> 01:18:08.983
Cause westernized medicine
would just say that I'm

01:18:08.985 --> 01:18:12.019
suppressing traumatic
memories of an event.

01:18:12.021 --> 01:18:13.519
Just like I've been saying.

01:18:13.521 --> 01:18:15.990
And I promise you that is not
what's been happening to me.

01:18:15.992 --> 01:18:17.191
But it's real.

01:18:17.193 --> 01:18:18.926
And it was happening to my mom.

01:18:18.928 --> 01:18:20.127
Oh, come on.

01:18:20.129 --> 01:18:22.463
And I want it to stop
more than anything.

01:18:22.465 --> 01:18:24.298
And I wanna be able to
tell you what it is,

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:28.469
but first I have to be able
to prove to you what it is.

01:18:28.471 --> 01:18:30.037
Just like I was able to
prove that I could move

01:18:30.039 --> 01:18:32.006
that card with my mind.

01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:33.841
Just.

01:18:34.776 --> 01:18:36.243
You can stay here.

01:18:36.245 --> 01:18:37.745
I'll take care of you,

01:18:37.747 --> 01:18:39.346
we'll get you a good
therapist, and you'll...

01:18:39.348 --> 01:18:40.347
I'm gonna go.

01:18:40.349 --> 01:18:41.282
Go where?

01:18:41.284 --> 01:18:42.416
I'm gonna pack up and leave.

01:18:42.418 --> 01:18:43.350
Don't be silly.

01:18:43.352 --> 01:18:44.752
I need to go,

01:18:44.754 --> 01:18:46.153
so I can find a
way to prove to you

01:18:46.155 --> 01:18:48.222
what's been happening to me.

01:18:48.224 --> 01:18:50.458
Don't worry, okay?

01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:51.859
I'll be fine.

01:18:51.861 --> 01:18:54.962
They're not as smart
as they think they are.

01:18:54.964 --> 01:18:56.831
Amanda who is they?

01:18:56.833 --> 01:18:57.833
Amanda!

01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:03.370
Hey.

01:19:06.174 --> 01:19:08.042
Well let's get to it.

01:19:08.044 --> 01:19:11.078
What's so important
you needed to show me?

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.214
Play the video
file in your Inbox.

01:19:13.216 --> 01:19:14.482
I have three other angles,

01:19:14.484 --> 01:19:17.852
but this one should
explain everything.

01:19:27.062 --> 01:19:28.062
What the?

01:19:34.269 --> 01:19:36.871
What the hell is that thing?

01:19:38.039 --> 01:19:42.476
Can you come up
here as soon as you can?

01:19:42.478 --> 01:19:43.544
Ryan!

01:19:43.546 --> 01:19:45.112
Can you come up and help me?

01:19:45.114 --> 01:19:47.181
Yeah, yeah, of course.

01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:50.851
Okay I'll call you tomorrow.

01:19:50.853 --> 01:19:52.920
Okay, talk to ya then.

01:20:16.411 --> 01:20:19.313
Dang, when'd you get this good?

01:20:19.315 --> 01:20:22.483
Could we just record
it once, please?

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:25.519
I'm not your circus monkey.

01:20:25.521 --> 01:20:29.223
You know we need
it for the tape.

01:20:29.225 --> 01:20:30.057
Alright.

01:20:30.059 --> 01:20:32.159
Just give me a second.

01:20:41.236 --> 01:20:42.937
That's amazing!

01:20:43.538 --> 01:20:44.872
Are you happy now?

01:20:44.874 --> 01:20:46.140
I'm very happy.

01:20:51.246 --> 01:20:52.580
I can't believe you've
been living in this place

01:20:52.582 --> 01:20:56.116
for two months with
no electricity.

01:20:56.118 --> 01:20:57.184
Okay, it's on.

01:20:57.186 --> 01:20:58.186
Go ahead.

01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:03.624
My name is Amanda Cortney.

01:21:03.626 --> 01:21:07.428
I'm of sound mind and
relatively good health.

01:21:08.897 --> 01:21:10.564
For the past few months,

01:21:10.566 --> 01:21:12.166
I've been,

01:21:12.168 --> 01:21:13.901
for a lack of a better term,

01:21:13.903 --> 01:21:14.903
kidnapped.

01:21:15.570 --> 01:21:18.172
Taken against my will at night,

01:21:18.174 --> 01:21:20.975
over and over, by
these entities.

01:21:23.211 --> 01:21:24.211
These beings.

01:21:24.213 --> 01:21:25.312
That are,

01:21:26.448 --> 01:21:27.948
well they're
certainly not human,

01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:29.550
I could tell ya that much.

01:21:29.552 --> 01:21:33.120
Tell us how it usually happens.

01:21:33.122 --> 01:21:36.223
Something wakes me up
in my bed, late at night.

01:21:36.225 --> 01:21:37.992
But, I can't move.

01:21:39.461 --> 01:21:42.162
It's like I'm paralyzed.

01:21:42.164 --> 01:21:44.064
And then all the electronics,

01:21:44.066 --> 01:21:46.533
the phone, TV, clock, computer,

01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:50.404
anything that's on goes dead.

01:21:50.406 --> 01:21:54.108
So, there I am just
laying in bed, awake.

01:21:54.976 --> 01:21:57.344
But paralyzed in this silence.

01:21:58.446 --> 01:22:01.215
This dead silence
of nothingness.

01:22:02.384 --> 01:22:03.384
And then,

01:22:04.486 --> 01:22:06.320
the light comes.

01:22:06.322 --> 01:22:08.555
This bright, massive light

01:22:10.091 --> 01:22:11.992
fills the entire room.

01:22:12.994 --> 01:22:14.461
And I wanna scream,

01:22:16.965 --> 01:22:18.165
I wanna cry,

01:22:18.167 --> 01:22:20.534
I want them to leave me alone.

01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:23.704
But they don't.

01:22:23.706 --> 01:22:25.139
They never do.

01:22:25.141 --> 01:22:30.444
And then my body starts to
slowly float above the bed.

01:22:32.013 --> 01:22:33.314
And they take me.

01:22:35.183 --> 01:22:37.351
They take me away.

01:22:37.353 --> 01:22:39.687
Where do they take you?

01:22:39.689 --> 01:22:41.422
To a room in some,

01:22:43.391 --> 01:22:46.627
look, I know all of
this sounds crazy,

01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:48.229
but I have proof.

01:22:48.230 --> 01:22:51.065
You definitely have proof.

01:22:51.067 --> 01:22:51.999
I'm a believer.

01:22:52.001 --> 01:22:53.534
That's why I'm here.

01:22:54.502 --> 01:22:55.602
So they take me.

01:22:55.604 --> 01:22:56.670
These, well,

01:22:58.239 --> 01:22:59.073
there's three different types.

01:22:59.075 --> 01:23:01.041
Three species, I guess.

01:23:02.344 --> 01:23:04.478
And they do things to me.

01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:09.416
Experiments.

01:23:10.352 --> 01:23:12.286
They do things that,

01:23:14.556 --> 01:23:16.390
I don't wanna talk about it.

01:23:16.392 --> 01:23:19.259
And trust me if they
did them to you,

01:23:19.261 --> 01:23:22.363
you wouldn't wanna
talk about them either.

01:23:22.365 --> 01:23:23.397
I remember.

01:23:23.399 --> 01:23:26.400
I remember flashes
here and there.

01:23:26.402 --> 01:23:30.137
And I don't think they
know that I can remember.

01:23:30.139 --> 01:23:33.674
Cause they speak to
me, inside my head.

01:23:33.676 --> 01:23:37.411
You'll be okay, you won't
remember any of this.

01:23:37.413 --> 01:23:39.179
But I do remember.

01:23:47.055 --> 01:23:49.490
The physical stuff, I can take.

01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:52.760
As messed up as that is.

01:23:54.295 --> 01:23:57.631
But my mind, my memories,
my emotions, my being,

01:24:01.036 --> 01:24:02.669
that they can't have.

01:24:04.205 --> 01:24:06.707
What have you
done to try and stop them?

01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:08.308
Everything.

01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:10.377
Anything you could think of.

01:24:10.379 --> 01:24:13.313
I moved out into the
middle of nowhere.

01:24:13.315 --> 01:24:15.616
I stayed at people's houses.

01:24:15.618 --> 01:24:18.252
I tried to get a friend to
stay up all night with me once.

01:24:18.254 --> 01:24:19.453
I've tried to get three friends

01:24:19.455 --> 01:24:20.621
to stay up all night with me.

01:24:20.623 --> 01:24:22.222
I was one of those three.

01:24:22.224 --> 01:24:24.758
That was a crazy night.

01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:26.360
It didn't work.

01:24:26.362 --> 01:24:28.095
They took me anyway.

01:24:29.197 --> 01:24:31.665
I found this crazy guy online,

01:24:31.667 --> 01:24:35.302
and I rented out his
underground bunker.

01:24:35.304 --> 01:24:36.503
That was stupid.

01:24:38.139 --> 01:24:39.440
I nailed the door shut,
I nailed the window shut.

01:24:39.442 --> 01:24:41.575
I tied myself to the bed.

01:24:44.345 --> 01:24:45.512
Doesn't work.

01:24:46.414 --> 01:24:48.382
I tried to record
them taking me.

01:24:48.384 --> 01:24:50.417
I used a hidden camera,

01:24:50.419 --> 01:24:52.319
a hidden spy camera,

01:24:52.321 --> 01:24:55.122
a hidden infrared spy camera.

01:24:55.124 --> 01:24:56.423
Nothing.

01:24:56.425 --> 01:24:59.460
Just all comes out
garbled static.

01:25:00.595 --> 01:25:03.497
I hooked up a hair trigger
shotgun, three times.

01:25:03.499 --> 01:25:04.631
I woke up the next morning,

01:25:04.633 --> 01:25:07.334
each time, to a bent shotgun.

01:25:09.737 --> 01:25:12.106
But I realized something.

01:25:12.108 --> 01:25:15.876
They can recognize threats like
the gun and neutralize them.

01:25:15.878 --> 01:25:19.480
They can mess with
anything electronic.

01:25:19.482 --> 01:25:21.515
They can play with
our minds and memories

01:25:21.517 --> 01:25:26.386
because our brains function
via electrical impulses.

01:25:26.388 --> 01:25:28.188
But there are ways
to record things

01:25:28.190 --> 01:25:31.225
without any electronics,
any batteries,

01:25:31.227 --> 01:25:32.559
no electricity.

01:25:33.761 --> 01:25:34.761
Over here,

01:25:36.164 --> 01:25:39.666
these are eight millimeter
1950s film cameras.

01:25:39.668 --> 01:25:41.435
They run on wind up Springs,

01:25:41.437 --> 01:25:43.170
and shoot on film.

01:25:43.172 --> 01:25:44.371
All chemical.

01:25:44.373 --> 01:25:48.275
No electronics, no
batteries, no electricity.

01:25:49.410 --> 01:25:52.246
Over here, this is
a fully functional

01:25:52.248 --> 01:25:55.883
1920s replica Victor talking
machine record player

01:25:55.885 --> 01:25:59.253
that can also record
sound onto a wax record.

01:25:59.255 --> 01:26:01.488
No batteries, no electricity,

01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:02.923
thank you very much.

01:26:02.925 --> 01:26:04.391
And what did you do

01:26:04.393 --> 01:26:07.494
with these two ancient
relics of technology?

01:26:07.496 --> 01:26:10.931
I set them in my
room a few weeks ago,

01:26:10.933 --> 01:26:13.500
and I recorded them taking me.

01:26:13.502 --> 01:26:17.504
And now I know I can beat
these mother fuckers.

01:26:27.348 --> 01:26:28.482
I had the four eight
millimeter cameras

01:26:28.484 --> 01:26:30.417
and Victor phones
set up on a kind of

01:26:30.419 --> 01:26:32.719
reverse electrical switch.

01:26:32.721 --> 01:26:34.254
Now I'm recording film and sound

01:26:34.256 --> 01:26:37.291
entirely free of electricity.

01:26:37.293 --> 01:26:40.327
Obviously they create some
vortex or field or something

01:26:40.329 --> 01:26:43.430
that no one sees
what's going on.

01:26:43.432 --> 01:26:44.698
I'll make sure the cameras

01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:47.467
are strapped down
better this time.

01:26:48.603 --> 01:26:51.638
It won't be so easy
for them next time.

01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:57.444
The film's impressive.

01:26:57.446 --> 01:26:59.413
I'm gonna have the four
eight millimeter cameras

01:26:59.415 --> 01:27:00.581
set up all over the room.

01:27:00.583 --> 01:27:02.849
As well as the Victor
talking machine.

01:27:02.851 --> 01:27:04.651
And I have water balloons,

01:27:04.653 --> 01:27:06.486
but they're not
filled with water.

01:27:06.488 --> 01:27:08.855
They're filled
with sulfuric acid.

01:27:08.857 --> 01:27:10.557
And I have a trip catapult wire,

01:27:10.559 --> 01:27:13.460
ready to set off on anything
that walks through that door.

01:27:13.462 --> 01:27:15.295
And if that doesn't work,

01:27:15.297 --> 01:27:18.332
next stop is a U.S. army
directional land mine.

01:27:18.334 --> 01:27:20.601
First thing's first.

01:27:21.636 --> 01:27:23.537
My name is Amanda Cortney.

01:27:23.539 --> 01:27:27.341
I'm 24 years old, and
I'm a multiple abductee.

01:27:27.343 --> 01:27:29.309
But I won't be anymore.

01:27:30.645 --> 01:27:32.646
I'll be recording all night.

01:27:32.648 --> 01:27:34.481
Until they mess up your camera,

01:27:34.483 --> 01:27:35.983
and they will.

01:27:35.985 --> 01:27:37.784
Need anything else?

01:27:37.786 --> 01:27:39.620
I'm good.

01:27:39.622 --> 01:27:40.622
I'm ready.

01:27:41.556 --> 01:27:43.023
Thank you, Ryan.

01:27:43.025 --> 01:27:44.424
Good night.

01:27:44.426 --> 01:27:45.726
Night.

01:29:44.846 --> 01:29:45.846
Hey.

01:29:46.614 --> 01:29:49.783
Still no sign from them at all?

01:29:49.785 --> 01:29:51.017
Been over a month.

01:29:51.019 --> 01:29:52.019
Nothing.

01:29:53.521 --> 01:29:54.755
That's good.

01:29:56.391 --> 01:29:57.958
Well, I need to crash.

01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:00.861
Have to fly out
for work tomorrow.

01:30:02.563 --> 01:30:03.563
Ryan.

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:07.634
I wish you were here.

01:30:07.636 --> 01:30:08.636
Next to me.

01:30:10.505 --> 01:30:13.673
I think it's time we
consummate this relationship.

01:30:15.577 --> 01:30:17.811
You want me to leave the
chat and camera out again

01:30:17.813 --> 01:30:18.879
while you sleep?

01:30:18.881 --> 01:30:20.514
Would you?

01:30:20.516 --> 01:30:21.181
I know it's silly.

01:30:21.183 --> 01:30:22.983
Of course.

01:30:22.985 --> 01:30:25.085
I'll come out in the
next couple weekends,

01:30:25.087 --> 01:30:26.920
and we'll consummate.

01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:29.890
Over and over?

01:30:29.892 --> 01:30:31.491
Over and over.

01:30:32.527 --> 01:30:33.994
Good night, Amanda.

01:30:34.896 --> 01:30:36.730
Good night, Ryan.

01:31:21.108 --> 01:31:22.709
Nicole.

01:31:22.711 --> 01:31:25.011
When we turn the machine on,

01:31:25.013 --> 01:31:28.615
it created a, semi-permanent
time dilation bubble

01:31:28.617 --> 01:31:29.716
that expands, we know this,

01:31:29.718 --> 01:31:31.017
yes it expands.

01:31:31.019 --> 01:31:35.188
Simultaneously, it created
the bubble that shrinks.

01:31:36.757 --> 01:31:39.259
Meaning we can be in two
different time dilations.

01:31:40.896 --> 01:31:42.896
The semi-permanent one,

01:31:42.898 --> 01:31:44.965
that's the one that keeps expanding
every time we turn it on

01:31:44.967 --> 01:31:46.833
we get to go out there, and
that's what lets us interact

01:31:46.835 --> 01:31:47.968
with these things, okay.

01:31:47.970 --> 01:31:48.935
Nicole we can go out there,

01:31:48.937 --> 01:31:49.769
and we can touch the seats,

01:31:49.771 --> 01:31:50.737
we can touch the light.

01:31:50.739 --> 01:31:52.739
That line, that line right now,

01:31:52.741 --> 01:31:53.974
is somewhere in the
middle of this theater,

01:31:53.976 --> 01:31:56.843
but we don't know where it is.

01:31:56.845 --> 01:31:57.944
Here, right here, right here.

01:31:57.946 --> 01:31:58.946
Where is it?

01:31:59.915 --> 01:32:01.748
When I did my
calculations right here.

01:32:02.885 --> 01:32:04.551
Because it's coming in so much,

01:32:04.553 --> 01:32:05.919
we can only run this thing
one more time, Nicole.

01:32:05.921 --> 01:32:07.854
We got one more shot at this.

01:32:09.525 --> 01:32:10.725
That's what cut Jason in half.

01:32:12.194 --> 01:32:13.994
He was in two
dilations at one time,

01:32:13.996 --> 01:32:16.530
and that's why he
got cut in half.

01:32:16.532 --> 01:32:18.298
We only have time to power
up maybe one more time,

01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:19.833
before it gets too small.

01:32:19.835 --> 01:32:22.068
Anytime after that, it's
gonna shrink so much

01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:23.737
we're not gonna fit inside,

01:32:23.739 --> 01:32:25.705
and then we're gonna end
up just like him, or worse.

01:32:25.707 --> 01:32:28.067
We can be in an infinite number
of time dilations right now.

01:32:31.913 --> 01:32:32.913
Multiple time dilations.

01:32:36.752 --> 01:32:39.853
I don't know, we can be
in an infinite number

01:32:39.855 --> 01:32:41.621
of time dilations.

01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:44.057
Get down!

01:32:56.904 --> 01:32:58.572
What was that?

01:32:58.574 --> 01:32:59.973
Did you hear it?

01:33:21.128 --> 01:33:22.829
Set the pulse
rate to nine, Nicole.

01:33:22.831 --> 01:33:23.829
What, okay?

01:33:23.831 --> 01:33:25.131
Then we'll
power all the way to 10.

01:33:25.133 --> 01:33:26.333
Okay.

01:33:26.335 --> 01:33:28.134
Wait, wait, how are you
gonna keep it there?

01:33:28.136 --> 01:33:29.636
I'm gonna be in there with it.

01:33:30.806 --> 01:33:32.339
No Martin, you'll die.

01:33:32.341 --> 01:33:34.040
I'm already dead, Nicole.

01:33:34.042 --> 01:33:35.375
What?

01:33:35.377 --> 01:33:37.110
You saw what that
thing did to me.

01:33:37.112 --> 01:33:38.612
You know that I'm dead.

01:33:38.614 --> 01:33:39.946
No.

01:33:43.918 --> 01:33:45.018
I can't.

01:35:08.703 --> 01:35:09.936
Hey, hey.

01:35:09.938 --> 01:35:10.970
You won't believe
what just happened.

01:35:10.972 --> 01:35:12.205
I need you to.

01:35:13.107 --> 01:35:14.107
Hello?

01:35:15.042 --> 01:35:17.143
No, can you hear me?

01:35:17.145 --> 01:35:18.145
No!

01:35:21.382 --> 01:35:23.917
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:35:43.037 --> 01:35:44.137
Hello!

01:35:50.377 --> 01:35:52.445
Okay, I gotta go, bye.

01:35:54.982 --> 01:35:56.249
What's that?

01:35:56.251 --> 01:36:00.220
I don't know, it
wasn't there before.

01:36:00.222 --> 01:36:01.222
Weird.

01:36:03.090 --> 01:36:04.357
Why's the door open?

01:36:04.359 --> 01:36:05.425
It's open?

01:36:42.196 --> 01:36:44.364
You used to believe in us.

01:36:44.366 --> 01:36:45.799
In your myths,

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:47.534
your legends,

01:36:48.502 --> 01:36:50.003
your religions.

01:36:53.908 --> 01:36:56.509
Your ignorance
gives us strength.

01:36:59.947 --> 01:37:02.215
We influence many into chaos.

01:37:05.886 --> 01:37:08.421
We hide in the open.

01:37:11.192 --> 01:37:12.926
We rarely show our true form.

01:37:17.598 --> 01:37:19.866
We have many other enemies.

01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:29.609
You're getting
close to the truth.

01:37:30.578 --> 01:37:31.845
To us.

01:37:32.379 --> 01:37:33.980
We won't let that happen.
