00:01.653 --> 00:04.004
Previously onCharmed...I'm Tessa,

00:04.047 --> 00:07.529
your new and improved
Whitelighter. You'reour new Whitelighter.

00:07.572 --> 00:09.009
MAGGIE:
The Abiku must have taken over

00:09.052 --> 00:10.575
Galvin's body in the jungle.

00:10.619 --> 00:12.664
That Abiku thing,
it-it made me kill people.

00:12.708 --> 00:13.665
I don't want anything to do

00:13.709 --> 00:15.145
with any of this stuff
ever again.

00:16.364 --> 00:17.321
You're hiding something from me.

00:17.365 --> 00:18.975
I'm a witch.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.457
We meet again. Shall we?

00:22.500 --> 00:24.720
MEL: Who killed the Sarcana? JADA: Fiona.

00:24.763 --> 00:25.938
Mel, she has Harry.

00:25.982 --> 00:27.592
Fiona is one of the only

00:27.636 --> 00:29.029
witches alive that can match

00:29.072 --> 00:30.465
the Charmed Ones' powers.

00:34.556 --> 00:36.645
MAGGIE:
What if he left it for us?

00:36.688 --> 00:37.950
Like a bougie

00:37.994 --> 00:39.822
British bread crumb to follow?

00:39.865 --> 00:40.953
We don't have
to trust Tessa.

00:40.997 --> 00:42.999
We use her
to help us find Harry.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.740
The same way the Elders
have been using us.

00:55.272 --> 00:57.144
Fiona, no!

00:59.146 --> 01:00.843
Harry, how many times
do I have to tell you?

01:00.886 --> 01:02.975
You can't break my concentration
in the middle of a spell.

01:03.019 --> 01:05.674
Don't you remember
how much it upsets me?

01:10.896 --> 01:12.463
Heal me.

01:12.507 --> 01:13.986
No.

01:27.522 --> 01:28.914
Fiona, please.

01:28.958 --> 01:30.612
This has to end.

01:31.917 --> 01:34.703
It will. Soon enough.

01:44.365 --> 01:46.149
See, Harry?

01:46.193 --> 01:50.545
That Vortex Viribus gave me
some fun new powers.

01:57.987 --> 02:00.424
But I broke you out of Tartarus.

02:00.468 --> 02:02.252
I'm on your side.
Why are you doing this?

02:02.296 --> 02:03.993
Because you're just like
the Elders!

02:04.036 --> 02:06.169
You all want to use me
to control magic.

02:09.216 --> 02:13.437
But I serve no one, witch.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.970
What's the matter, Harry?

02:25.014 --> 02:28.757
You look... shocked.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.628
That was nothing.

02:30.672 --> 02:33.109
Just wait till you see
what I have in store

02:33.153 --> 02:34.545
for your precious Charmed Ones.

02:49.517 --> 02:51.606
Oh, my God.

02:51.649 --> 02:53.390
How horrible.

02:53.434 --> 02:55.871
Jada.

02:55.914 --> 02:57.916
Macy, are you okay?

02:59.440 --> 03:00.658
Mace?

03:00.702 --> 03:02.573
Macy.

03:02.617 --> 03:06.011
Yeah. I'm fine.

03:06.055 --> 03:09.928
Sticking Elder Bari's needle
in your forehead is no joke.

03:09.972 --> 03:13.454
Wait. The anti-surveillance
candle's still lit, right?

03:13.497 --> 03:15.195
Are you sure you're okay?

03:15.238 --> 03:16.718
We shouldn't overdo
your evil sight.

03:16.761 --> 03:18.937
I'm fine. The more
important thing

03:18.981 --> 03:21.157
is Harry is under
Fiona's control.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.463
We have to get him back.

03:22.506 --> 03:24.595
Did you see the way
she made him heal her?

03:24.639 --> 03:27.032
That's probably why
she's keeping him around.

03:27.076 --> 03:28.512
Oh, God.

03:28.556 --> 03:29.992
Poor Harry.

03:30.035 --> 03:31.515
They used to be close,

03:31.559 --> 03:32.821
and he had to stand
there just watching her

03:32.864 --> 03:34.736
slaughter those witches.

03:34.779 --> 03:36.694
So, Fiona brought on
the blossoming of death

03:36.738 --> 03:38.087
by killing the Sarcana.

03:38.130 --> 03:40.307
Why is the Keeper of the Flame
paving the way

03:40.350 --> 03:42.222
for the Source of All Evil?
It doesn't add up.

03:42.265 --> 03:44.746
Whatever the connection,
we need to find Harry.

03:44.789 --> 03:46.313
And fast.

03:48.315 --> 03:52.232
You are gonna help me raise
the Source of All Evil.

03:52.275 --> 03:53.972
What?

03:54.016 --> 03:55.844
Did you think I rescued you

03:55.887 --> 03:58.194
out of the goodness of my heart?

03:58.238 --> 04:00.196
Pour me a drink.

04:04.548 --> 04:07.203
And one for yourself, as well.

04:07.247 --> 04:10.511
It's time to move on
to the next phase.

04:10.554 --> 04:12.252
I fixed you a drink.

04:12.295 --> 04:14.079
Get someone else to raise
the Source for you.

04:14.123 --> 04:16.604
Do I need to remind you
that you have nothing?

04:16.647 --> 04:19.476
You arenothing.

04:19.520 --> 04:21.043
If it wasn't for me,

04:21.086 --> 04:22.131
you would be wasting away

04:22.174 --> 04:23.828
in Tartarus.

04:23.872 --> 04:28.137
Do I make myself clear?

04:31.488 --> 04:33.447
Crystal.

04:40.454 --> 04:43.761
Speaking of Tartarus,

04:43.805 --> 04:46.634
I think it is time for you

04:46.677 --> 04:49.158
to turn yourself in.

04:55.556 --> 04:56.992
CHARITY:
Ow. Ow. Hello?

04:57.035 --> 04:58.298
You can lighten up
on the arms, please.

04:58.341 --> 04:59.690
In 300 years,

04:59.734 --> 05:00.822
I don't think I've ever seen

05:00.865 --> 05:02.954
anyone surrender
themselves willingly.

05:02.998 --> 05:05.305
Well, I'm full of surprises.

05:34.377 --> 05:35.422
ALL:
Tessa!

05:35.465 --> 05:36.727
What's up?

05:37.641 --> 05:38.816
We are sure you've heard

05:38.860 --> 05:40.383
another sign
of the Prophecy appeared.

05:40.427 --> 05:41.515
"The blossoming of death."

05:41.558 --> 05:43.081
Yes, the Elders are trying to...

05:43.125 --> 05:44.996
We have to tell you something

05:45.040 --> 05:47.434
about Harry and Fiona.

05:48.435 --> 05:50.045
You did the right thing
telling me this.

05:50.088 --> 05:53.918
Fiona is incredibly dangerous.
I should be able to use

05:53.962 --> 05:55.833
my Whitelighter bond with Harry
to track them down.

05:55.877 --> 05:57.095
That's a great idea.

05:57.139 --> 05:59.097
Thank you so much, Tessa.

05:59.141 --> 06:01.404
Listen, you need
to stay away from Fiona

06:01.448 --> 06:02.927
while I look for them.

06:02.971 --> 06:04.929
I know you like to go rogue

06:04.973 --> 06:07.105
in these situations.
Are we clear?

06:07.149 --> 06:08.672
Yes.

06:08.716 --> 06:10.239
Good.

06:11.327 --> 06:14.678
I have to say,
I'm proud of you three.

06:14.722 --> 06:18.073
I'm sure it wasn't easy telling
me that Harry was still alive

06:18.116 --> 06:20.075
given what
the Elders did to him.MAGGIE: Oh, it was...

06:20.118 --> 06:22.599
it was the right thing to do.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.775
You're such a good Whitelighter,

06:24.819 --> 06:26.690
Tessa. Aw!

06:26.734 --> 06:29.606
Thanks. Aw.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.129
Okay, bye.

06:31.173 --> 06:32.609
Bye.

06:37.309 --> 06:38.354
Slipped her the tracking ring.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.138
Good job.So we're all set.

06:40.182 --> 06:43.315
I will take the first shift in
tailing her and keep you posted.

06:43.359 --> 06:45.361
She leads us to
Fiona and Harry,

06:45.405 --> 06:47.363
and then we take down this
murderous psycho-witch.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.713
And we save
our OG Whitelighter.

06:56.328 --> 06:58.113
Galvin. Hey.

06:58.156 --> 06:59.593
Hey.

07:08.210 --> 07:10.168
Everything okay?

07:10.212 --> 07:12.736
Uh, yeah. Just, um...

07:12.780 --> 07:16.218
Well, Galvin and I broke up,
so it's just...

07:16.261 --> 07:19.003
Well, frankly, he seemed...

07:19.047 --> 07:22.180
he seemed scared
of me because...

07:22.224 --> 07:23.747
Well, you know.

07:23.791 --> 07:26.620
Macy, my treatment with Parker

07:26.663 --> 07:28.491
went better than expected.

07:28.535 --> 07:29.623
He's almost fully human.

07:29.666 --> 07:30.841
That's great.

07:30.885 --> 07:33.888
I would be happy to help
you out with your...

07:33.931 --> 07:35.455
your dark side.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.849
Well, that's the thing.

07:38.893 --> 07:41.548
Uh, Galvin had a way
to help me with that,

07:41.591 --> 07:43.245
but I decided not to use it.

07:44.333 --> 07:48.293
I can control it,
and I am comfortable with it.

07:48.337 --> 07:51.296
It's just... the guy I love

07:51.340 --> 07:53.342
is not.

07:53.385 --> 07:55.562
Well, all relationships
are tough.

07:55.605 --> 07:57.607
But one where one of you
is so much more powerful

07:57.651 --> 08:00.697
than the other, they're
nearly impossible.

08:01.829 --> 08:04.179
I learned that the hard way.

08:04.222 --> 08:05.528
I'm so sorry.

08:16.670 --> 08:17.801
You're all better.

08:17.845 --> 08:19.150
Not yet.

08:19.194 --> 08:21.065
Oh, come on. It's been weeks.

08:23.198 --> 08:24.591
My mom has one more
dose to give me.

08:24.634 --> 08:25.983
Then I'll be fully human.

08:26.027 --> 08:27.811
I think we should wait.

08:27.855 --> 08:29.160
Seriously?

08:29.204 --> 08:31.293
Tomorrow night.

08:31.336 --> 08:32.642
We'll make it special.

08:32.686 --> 08:34.426
I guess I can wait.

08:34.470 --> 08:36.864
Our first time
having fully human sex.

08:39.606 --> 08:41.564
Are you scared?

08:41.608 --> 08:44.262
No way. Once I'm human,
I'll have you to protect me.

08:44.306 --> 08:48.353
With you in my life, I know
my darkness can't take over.

09:05.022 --> 09:08.243
Is this really necessary?You're not returning my calls.

09:08.286 --> 09:10.375
You shouldn't be following me.
It's dangerous.

09:10.419 --> 09:12.116
I went back to that
tattoo parlor.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.379
Everything that was ransacked
was magically cleaned up.

09:14.423 --> 09:16.120
It was like the Sarcana
never existed.

09:16.164 --> 09:18.645
So the Elders cleaned it up.Who?

09:18.688 --> 09:20.516
Mel, it's been my job
to investigate cults

09:20.560 --> 09:21.604
and help get people out of them.

09:21.648 --> 09:22.823
I know the Sarcana
weren't a cult,

09:22.866 --> 09:26.827
but what happened to them?
You have to tell me.

09:26.870 --> 09:28.829
Is that a magical compass?

09:28.872 --> 09:33.485
Yes, it is,
and it's pointing to...

09:40.101 --> 09:42.669
What the hell?Rookie mistake.

09:42.712 --> 09:45.280
Looks like your mark
is onto you.

09:45.323 --> 09:46.847
I can't believe it.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.413
Look, I know I'm just a human,

09:48.457 --> 09:50.241
but I also happen to be
a kickass PI.

09:50.285 --> 09:53.288
If you need to track someone
down, I can help.

10:06.083 --> 10:07.432
Are you ready to become human?

10:07.476 --> 10:09.260
It's gonna work, right?

10:09.304 --> 10:12.612
Yes, this is going to work.

10:15.397 --> 10:17.660
Just relax.
Take a deep breath.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.372
Parker?

10:34.416 --> 10:36.418
Parker?

10:38.028 --> 10:40.030
Parker?!

10:46.820 --> 10:49.692
Mom? Mom?

10:52.086 --> 10:53.957
Parker?

10:54.001 --> 10:55.132
Parker? Parker?

10:57.961 --> 11:00.094
All right. It's all right.

11:00.137 --> 11:01.748
Parker! Parker!

11:11.018 --> 11:13.194
Mom?!

11:13.237 --> 11:14.325
Mom!

11:16.110 --> 11:17.024
Mom?!

11:18.286 --> 11:20.418
Mom?!

11:52.886 --> 11:54.888
Dr. Julia?

12:00.676 --> 12:02.722
Oh, God.

12:09.032 --> 12:10.338
Oh!

12:10.381 --> 12:13.863
Sorry. Galvin.

12:13.907 --> 12:16.997
Something wrong?No. Um...

12:17.040 --> 12:18.781
have you seen Dr. Julia yet?

12:18.825 --> 12:21.088
Nah, but I just got in.

12:21.131 --> 12:22.785
It's just she's
usually in by now.

12:22.829 --> 12:25.266
I don't know what
happened here.

12:25.309 --> 12:28.182
Well, maybe she's late,
and, uh...

12:28.225 --> 12:30.227
someone dropped a syringe.

12:31.272 --> 12:32.795
Mm. Right. It's just,

12:32.839 --> 12:35.667
I-I called her,
and, um, left a message.

12:35.711 --> 12:37.147
She-she didn't get back.

12:37.191 --> 12:39.323
She's a workaholic.
She's always reachable.

12:39.367 --> 12:42.936
It's just, I...
think something's wrong.

12:42.979 --> 12:45.721
Macy... mm.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.245
Do you remember when
I told you about that Prophecy?

12:48.289 --> 12:49.812
I told you. I don't
want anything

12:49.856 --> 12:51.379
to do with that anymore.

12:51.422 --> 12:54.034
I am barely getting
through my days.

12:54.077 --> 12:55.383
All I can think about is

12:55.426 --> 12:58.647
what I did to that
customs agent and Mama Roz.

12:58.690 --> 13:01.476
You know that wasn't you.I saw it!

13:01.519 --> 13:04.740
I saw myself do those things.

13:04.784 --> 13:08.222
I can never get over that.

13:08.265 --> 13:10.615
So please, just...

13:10.659 --> 13:13.227
leave me alone.

13:13.270 --> 13:16.230
I'm sorry. I-I can't be the
person you talk to about this.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.409
Right. Well,
um, just...

13:21.452 --> 13:25.152
let me know
if you see her. Thanks.

13:45.259 --> 13:48.001
What's an "unshackling spell"?

13:48.044 --> 13:52.266
Shh. Don't... don't talk
about this stuff out loud.

13:52.309 --> 13:54.398
Oh, nobody's
paying attention.

13:54.442 --> 13:55.660
So, who are you
unshackling?

13:55.704 --> 13:57.184
It's not important.

13:57.227 --> 13:58.838
What do you have for me?

13:58.881 --> 14:00.622
Nothing yet. Still
waiting to hear back

14:00.665 --> 14:02.667
from my Hilltowne
PD contact to see

14:02.711 --> 14:05.583
if his facial recognition
software has located Tessa.

14:05.627 --> 14:08.412
So once we track this
Tessa down, what's next?

14:08.456 --> 14:11.894
What's next is, I say "thanks,"
and you go back to your life.

14:11.938 --> 14:15.942
Oh, come on, Mel.I'm serious. The next phase
of this plan is too...

14:18.031 --> 14:19.989
Too dangerous
to involve you.

14:20.033 --> 14:21.948
Oh, really?

14:21.991 --> 14:24.907
'Cause I just
got a hit.

14:24.951 --> 14:27.823
I'll let you see if
I can come along.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.304
Fine. Just...

14:31.871 --> 14:33.220
Okay.

14:33.263 --> 14:36.876
Tessa Flores-Cohen--
she's a...

14:36.919 --> 14:39.922
resident adviser on
West Campus Hall 7?

14:39.966 --> 14:43.012
Hmm. Whitelighters
do have covers.

14:43.056 --> 14:44.579
What?

14:44.622 --> 14:46.320
I'll-I'll explain
on the way.

14:46.363 --> 14:48.061
Come on, let's go.

14:48.104 --> 14:49.410
Yes.

14:52.152 --> 14:54.981
MAN:
Hey, Mags.

14:56.025 --> 14:58.245
Hey, Maggie.Hey, girl.

15:01.726 --> 15:04.207
Hey, guys.

15:04.251 --> 15:05.730
What are you doing
wearing my trench coat?

15:05.774 --> 15:09.909
What are you doing...
ditching work?

15:09.952 --> 15:11.954
Niko is helping me
find Tessa.

15:11.998 --> 15:13.390
She is?

15:13.434 --> 15:15.131
Oh, your sisters
are witches, too!

15:15.175 --> 15:17.351
How did I not think of that?

15:17.394 --> 15:21.268
Sorry. Sorry. Just...
mind blown all over again.

15:21.311 --> 15:23.748
Yup. One big happy
coven. Now you know.

15:23.792 --> 15:25.576
By the way, we try to
keep it under wraps.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.752
Yeah.Speaking of...

15:27.796 --> 15:29.232
I'm headed
to see Parker.

15:29.276 --> 15:30.625
Guess what's
under this.

15:30.668 --> 15:32.322
I don't want to know.:
Nothing.

15:32.366 --> 15:34.716
Great. You have fun
with that,

15:34.759 --> 15:35.935
but remember
to keep your phone on you

15:35.978 --> 15:36.979
just in case
I need to call you.

15:37.023 --> 15:39.025
Got it. Good luck!You, too.

15:40.461 --> 15:41.984
Dry clean that
before you return it.

15:45.422 --> 15:47.381
MAGGIE:
It's cold outside,

15:47.424 --> 15:51.515
but it's about
to get hot in here.

15:54.257 --> 15:56.259
Parker?

16:19.282 --> 16:22.068
Julia never came
in, did she?

16:22.111 --> 16:25.810
No. And I just found
her badge on her desk.

16:25.854 --> 16:29.727
Yeah, and I just saw her car
out in the parking lot.

16:29.771 --> 16:32.382
Look, I know you don't want
to get involved,

16:32.426 --> 16:36.821
but something
is wrong here.

16:36.865 --> 16:39.389
The contents of that syringe...

16:39.433 --> 16:43.959
do not belong in this lab.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.570
I think she's in trouble.
I'm gonna go check her car.

16:46.614 --> 16:49.138
Wait.

16:49.182 --> 16:50.487
I'm gonna go with you.

16:59.235 --> 17:01.977
Who taught you to pick a lock?

17:02.021 --> 17:04.936
This cop I used to know.

17:15.730 --> 17:17.079
MEL:
Oh, crap.

17:17.123 --> 17:19.908
Crap!

17:52.288 --> 17:53.289
Oh.

17:58.512 --> 18:02.429
GALVIN:
Oh, my God.

18:02.472 --> 18:04.518
What are you doing?Calling the cops.

18:04.561 --> 18:07.042
No! Not yet.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.696
If this is demonic,
which it has to be,

18:08.739 --> 18:11.655
we cannot have the cops
looking arou--

18:15.616 --> 18:17.139
Macy, she's dead.

18:17.183 --> 18:20.142
We can't just leave
her body in the trunk.

18:20.186 --> 18:23.319
We can, and we have to.

18:23.363 --> 18:26.409
Look, I didn't ask you for help.

18:26.453 --> 18:28.498
I just...

18:28.542 --> 18:30.979
I just need you
to let me handle this my way.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.766
She's dead?

18:35.810 --> 18:39.292
And Parker's missing.

18:39.335 --> 18:41.032
That can't be a coincidence.

18:41.076 --> 18:43.557
He was supposed to get his final
treatment from her last night.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.602
And then, when I went over,
all of his stuff was gone.

18:45.646 --> 18:48.039
The syringe I found
in Dr. Julia's office

18:48.083 --> 18:52.000
had in it a highly concentrated
dosage of demonic blood plasma.

18:52.043 --> 18:54.916
Oh, God.

18:57.005 --> 18:58.702
Do you think Parker
could have...

19:00.226 --> 19:04.839
Last time he got this infection,
when he was little...

19:04.882 --> 19:07.058
he had a seizure, and ended up
attacking his mom.

19:07.102 --> 19:09.104
No, no, no, I--

19:11.019 --> 19:14.936
I don't think Dr. Julia would
have given Parker that dosage.

19:14.979 --> 19:17.895
There's something else
going on here.

19:17.939 --> 19:19.897
Do you think
Alistair's behind it?

19:19.941 --> 19:23.074
He's the one who got
Parker sick in the first place.

19:23.118 --> 19:26.034
Either way, you need
to find Parker.

19:28.297 --> 19:30.734
We need to know
what he knows.

19:30.778 --> 19:32.997
And I will use
Elder Bari's needle.

19:33.041 --> 19:37.176
Are you sure?

19:37.219 --> 19:42.311
Last time, it seemed
like it... got to you.

19:42.355 --> 19:46.185
My evil side is
the best way to know

19:46.228 --> 19:49.144
what really happened.

19:59.459 --> 20:01.417
TESSA:
Hello?

20:01.461 --> 20:03.245
No luck yet.
The signal's faint.

20:03.289 --> 20:06.988
He's under Fiona's control.
I'm sure that's not helping.

20:07.031 --> 20:11.732
Don't worry, I'll deliver Harry
straight back to you.

20:11.775 --> 20:14.822
Hang on, I think it's working.

20:17.564 --> 20:19.653
What are you doing?

20:19.696 --> 20:20.741
Shh.

20:41.849 --> 20:44.547
I've got him.
Gotta go.

20:50.814 --> 20:53.252
Mel?

20:56.037 --> 20:59.910
FIONA: Nothing. Keep looking.
Pull that one out, Harry.

21:04.350 --> 21:06.221
FIONA:
It's not in here!

21:08.571 --> 21:11.400
I beg you, Fiona, using the
Flame to control magic

21:11.444 --> 21:14.011
is not gonna change
what the Elders did to you.

21:14.055 --> 21:15.404
It won't take away
your pain.

21:15.448 --> 21:17.363
Oh, Harry, I thought
you knew me better than that.

21:17.406 --> 21:19.495
No-- Ah-- Aah!

21:19.539 --> 21:21.410
Magic ruined my life.

21:21.454 --> 21:24.413
I don't want to
control magic,

21:24.457 --> 21:26.546
I want to destroy it.

21:26.589 --> 21:29.200
And I'm not gonna let your
little Charmed Ones stop me.

21:29.244 --> 21:30.724
I'm strong enough now.
I can take them on

21:30.767 --> 21:32.203
when the time's right.

21:32.247 --> 21:34.945
The Charmed Ones can help you.

21:34.989 --> 21:37.165
They're different from
the Elders, the Sarcana.

21:37.208 --> 21:39.559
They would never use you.
So, please...

21:39.602 --> 21:43.476
stop this.

21:43.519 --> 21:45.695
It's not too late.

21:45.739 --> 21:49.177
Stop trying to manipulate me,
just like everyone else!

21:54.574 --> 21:56.750
It won't work.

22:02.582 --> 22:04.627
If you want to destroy magic,
why are we here?

22:04.671 --> 22:06.412
Is it just me,
or were you smarter

22:06.455 --> 22:09.110
before I went to Tartarus?

22:09.153 --> 22:10.720
We're trying to find
the Origin Dagger.

22:12.505 --> 22:14.681
The dagger that controls
the Flame?

22:14.724 --> 22:16.117
It's here?

22:16.160 --> 22:19.294
That's what the little map
I placed inside

22:19.338 --> 22:22.297
that handsome head of yours
said, at least.

22:24.647 --> 22:27.302
Nothing.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.173
Well, it's in one of these
coffins, let's keep looking.

22:30.697 --> 22:32.438
Over here.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.703
No!

22:36.746 --> 22:38.922
FIONA:
Right there.

22:38.966 --> 22:42.099
Show me Dr. Julia
Wagner's death.

22:48.845 --> 22:51.413
JULIA:
Are you ready to become human?

22:51.457 --> 22:52.414
It's gonna work, right?

22:52.458 --> 22:53.850
Relax.

22:56.157 --> 22:57.898
Parker.

22:57.941 --> 22:59.769
Parker!

22:59.813 --> 23:02.685
PARKER: Mom!

23:02.729 --> 23:06.428
Mom! Mom!

23:29.408 --> 23:32.323
And that's the last thing
you'll ever hear.

23:47.991 --> 23:50.124
Oh, Maggie...

23:50.167 --> 23:53.432
Parker. Parker!

23:55.869 --> 23:57.479
I've been looking everywhere
for you.

23:57.523 --> 23:59.568
My mom...

23:59.612 --> 24:02.005
I know.
I'm so sorry.

24:02.049 --> 24:03.703
What happened?

24:03.746 --> 24:05.661
I killed her.

24:05.705 --> 24:07.881
Oh, God.

24:07.924 --> 24:09.752
Your demon side came back.

24:09.796 --> 24:13.408
I didn't mean to. I didn't even
know what I was doing.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.715
Maggie, please...

24:17.325 --> 24:18.326
You're scared of me.

24:23.810 --> 24:27.596
Your mom was so sure
she could save you.

24:27.640 --> 24:29.816
That's all she wanted.

24:29.859 --> 24:31.818
She believed in you.

24:31.861 --> 24:33.776
She must have been so scared.

24:33.820 --> 24:36.562
You know me; you know I would
never hurt anyone on purpose.

24:36.605 --> 24:39.521
I love my mom.
Maggie,

24:39.565 --> 24:42.263
you're all that I have.

25:04.546 --> 25:07.680
It's like taking candy
from a baby.

25:07.723 --> 25:09.725
It's only a matter of time.

25:18.429 --> 25:21.563
FIONA: The Origin Dagger's
here somewhere, I just know it.

25:21.607 --> 25:24.131
Where do you think you're going?

25:24.174 --> 25:26.568
I thought I got rid of you
and that tracker.

25:26.612 --> 25:28.744
I told you to avoid
unnecessary danger.

25:28.788 --> 25:31.399
Ugh! Open this one.

25:31.442 --> 25:34.184
Fiona's unhinged.
I need to go to the Elders.

25:34.228 --> 25:36.317
No. We need to stop her now.

25:36.360 --> 25:38.493
If Fiona gets that dagger,
she's going to end all magic.

25:38.537 --> 25:41.191
That's why I need
to go to the Elders.

25:41.235 --> 25:42.366
Fiona will have
the dagger by then.

25:42.410 --> 25:43.933
We can't wait.

25:43.977 --> 25:45.326
Macy and Maggie are
on their way.

25:45.369 --> 25:47.154
This is our fight, Tessa.

25:47.197 --> 25:50.853
My sisters' and mine.
So let us fight it.

25:50.897 --> 25:53.073
Fine. But I want there to be
no confusion about this:

25:53.116 --> 25:54.553
Fiona is the Elders' priority.

25:54.596 --> 25:56.206
She must be turned over to them.

25:56.250 --> 25:58.513
She killed the Sarcana.

25:58.557 --> 25:59.906
She deserves whatever hell
is coming her way.

26:08.088 --> 26:11.178
FIONA:
Where is it?!

26:11.221 --> 26:14.094
She's cool. And we're gonna
need all the help we can get.

26:19.708 --> 26:23.016
FIONA: Is it in there?HARRY: It's not here.

26:23.059 --> 26:24.278
Just some bones.

26:33.461 --> 26:35.419
She mirrored
the Sarcana's powers, remember?

26:35.463 --> 26:36.812
Our powers are useless
against her.

26:41.948 --> 26:43.950
Harry!

26:45.865 --> 26:48.650
Mel!

26:48.694 --> 26:51.174
Oh!

26:57.137 --> 26:58.660
Tessa.

26:58.704 --> 27:02.708
This is your fight,
so fight it.

27:04.579 --> 27:06.668
Go.

27:13.457 --> 27:15.242
Tessa's dead.

27:15.285 --> 27:17.200
FIONA:
Are the Charmed Ones
going to cry?

27:17.244 --> 27:18.941
Where the hell did she go?

27:26.079 --> 27:28.908
What the hell are you doing?Let go of me.

27:28.951 --> 27:30.431
Just because you were
helpful down in Tartarus

27:30.474 --> 27:31.867
doesn't mean I'd
hesitate to kill you.

27:31.911 --> 27:34.609
It's nothing, I swear.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.263
I'll ask you one more time.

27:36.306 --> 27:38.439
What were you doing?

27:40.484 --> 27:43.966
Trying to reach
my sister, Fiona.

27:44.010 --> 27:47.056
She's the Keeper of the Flame
that controls magic,

27:47.100 --> 27:49.493
and she's about to retrieve
the Origin Dagger.

27:49.537 --> 27:52.627
But I need the Origin Dagger.
Why would a witch want it?

27:54.629 --> 27:57.458
Find me Fiona.

28:05.553 --> 28:08.774
You stay with Harry.
I'll find Fiona.

28:11.907 --> 28:13.735
Harry?

28:13.779 --> 28:16.085
FIONA:
Harry. Kill them.

28:17.913 --> 28:20.873
Mel, the unshackling spell!"Sever the binds..."

28:20.916 --> 28:22.657
No. No!

28:25.573 --> 28:26.879
"Sever the ties..."
Crap, I'm forgetting it.

28:26.922 --> 28:28.881
Inciti!

28:32.319 --> 28:33.929
Let go.

28:38.542 --> 28:40.370
Please stop, you're hurting me.

28:47.029 --> 28:49.423
She's too powerful.
Save yourselves.

28:50.467 --> 28:52.731
Aah... ahh... go.

28:52.774 --> 28:54.341
Not without you.

28:54.384 --> 28:56.735
"Sever the tie that binds to
that which no longer serves."

29:00.564 --> 29:01.740
I couldn't find her.

29:01.783 --> 29:05.221
Do I have to do
everything myself?

29:08.834 --> 29:10.270
She can't mirror
the Power of Three.

29:15.841 --> 29:18.408
You can't win.

29:18.452 --> 29:20.976
Maybe not today.

29:27.722 --> 29:29.202
MEL:
She can't be gone.

29:29.245 --> 29:31.987
She doesn't have
the Origin Dagger.

29:32.031 --> 29:33.293
It's not here.

29:33.336 --> 29:35.208
The map must have been wrong.

29:35.251 --> 29:39.778
So the dagger's still out there,
waiting to be found.

29:39.821 --> 29:42.737
And now, so is Fiona.

29:44.304 --> 29:46.175
Yes.

29:52.703 --> 29:56.795
There is no nobler death than
one in service to your charges.

29:56.838 --> 30:00.494
Thank you, Tessa.

30:00.537 --> 30:03.453
You were a good Whitelighter.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.535
You still have your powers.

30:41.578 --> 30:43.406
But if Fiona restored them,
wouldn't she take them back?

30:43.450 --> 30:45.931
The Vortex Viribus
restored my powers.

30:45.974 --> 30:48.107
The only thing that bound me
to Fiona was her collar,

30:48.150 --> 30:50.109
from which you
all freed me.

30:50.152 --> 30:52.198
I think this makes you
an independent Whitelighter.

30:52.241 --> 30:53.634
I suppose it does.

30:54.635 --> 30:57.116
Harry, you're free.

30:57.159 --> 30:58.857
You can do whatever you want.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.902
Hmm.

31:00.946 --> 31:03.339
MACY:
You don't have to answer
to the Elders anymore.

31:03.383 --> 31:07.126
You're bound to no one,
not even us.

31:07.169 --> 31:09.519
Like I would leave you
to make breakfast on your own.

31:09.563 --> 31:11.391
Come on, now.

31:11.434 --> 31:15.699
I don't understand. Why does
Fiona want to get rid of magic?

31:15.743 --> 31:17.701
Fiona feels she's been
used by others

31:17.745 --> 31:19.007
to gain power
her entire life.

31:19.051 --> 31:21.009
The Elders, the Sarcana.

31:21.053 --> 31:22.532
So she wanted
the Origin Dagger

31:22.576 --> 31:23.838
to take on the power herself.

31:23.882 --> 31:26.406
Well, yes, the dagger
would give her the power

31:26.449 --> 31:28.321
to control the Flame of Magic.

31:28.364 --> 31:29.844
Whoever pierces themselves
with it

31:29.888 --> 31:31.846
can sustain a massive amount
of power

31:31.890 --> 31:33.761
without being
consumed by it.

31:33.804 --> 31:35.676
Well, it's a good thing
she didn't get it.

31:35.719 --> 31:37.896
So why is Fiona going
for the Flame

31:37.939 --> 31:39.898
also bringing about
the blossoming of death?

31:39.941 --> 31:41.812
Yeah, that's...
from the Prophecy

31:41.856 --> 31:43.989
that's supposed to be about
the Source of All Evil.

31:44.032 --> 31:46.034
Right.

31:46.078 --> 31:51.735
So, either the timing of this
is a big coincidence, or...

31:51.779 --> 31:54.173
Or the Flame and the Source
are the same thing.

31:54.216 --> 31:57.002
My God.

31:59.221 --> 32:00.875
That would mean...

32:00.919 --> 32:03.573
both witches and demons...

32:03.617 --> 32:05.488
get their power from...

32:05.532 --> 32:07.142
From the exact same place.

32:07.186 --> 32:08.752
And whether it's good or evil

32:08.796 --> 32:10.406
depends on who possesses it.

32:31.732 --> 32:34.082
Glee laakh helltaakh.

32:46.399 --> 32:47.922
Here we are.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.969
Vegan breakfast patties.
You really are back.

32:53.972 --> 32:56.975
Still no response
from Parker.

32:58.889 --> 33:02.415
He's out there somewhere
thinking he killed his mom.

33:02.458 --> 33:05.244
I just got an e-mail
from the lab.

33:05.287 --> 33:08.595
Dr. Julia found dead
in her home.

33:08.638 --> 33:09.900
Of a heart attack.

33:09.944 --> 33:13.730
It was a situation
that needed to be handled.

33:13.774 --> 33:15.080
So I handled it.

33:15.123 --> 33:17.169
Okay. Still getting used
to this new independent

33:17.212 --> 33:20.041
Whitelighter look
on you.

33:20.085 --> 33:21.216
Thanks.

33:21.260 --> 33:23.001
I'm thinking
it suits you.

33:23.044 --> 33:25.525
We have even bigger things
to worry about now.

33:25.568 --> 33:27.962
Like Hunter out there
shape-shifting again.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.050
I agree.

33:29.094 --> 33:30.530
How did he even
get out of Tartarus?

33:30.573 --> 33:32.445
It has to be Alistair.

33:32.488 --> 33:34.012
if he has competition against
the Source of All Evil,

33:34.055 --> 33:35.839
he's upping his game.

33:35.883 --> 33:38.190
Guess I'm gonna need to use the
old evil sight more and more

33:38.233 --> 33:40.670
from now on.Macy, let's not
go to that right now.

33:40.714 --> 33:42.281
You're playing
with your dark side.

33:42.324 --> 33:44.152
I suspect it'll
come at a cost.

33:44.196 --> 33:45.458
You haven't
felt your...

33:45.501 --> 33:48.678
demon within growing,
have you?

33:48.722 --> 33:50.158
Of course not.

33:50.202 --> 33:53.596
Like I said, it's
all under control.

33:59.167 --> 34:01.082
So, Dr. Julia...

34:01.126 --> 34:04.825
Died of a heart attack.
Just like the e-mail said.

34:09.308 --> 34:11.788
Look, this doesn't
change anything.

34:11.832 --> 34:15.923
I still want to keep all
of this out of my life.

34:19.492 --> 34:23.104
I don't know how
I'm gonna do this.

34:23.148 --> 34:25.063
With everything
that's happened,

34:25.106 --> 34:26.542
seeing you here
every day.

34:26.586 --> 34:29.067
You won't have to
much longer.

34:30.590 --> 34:33.723
I took a job.
Doctors Without Borders.

34:33.767 --> 34:35.943
They need epidemiologists.

34:35.986 --> 34:37.510
I leave in a month.

34:37.553 --> 34:40.208
Galvin...

34:40.252 --> 34:41.731
I'm recommitting
to saving lives.

34:41.775 --> 34:44.430
You're trying to atone.Maybe.

34:44.473 --> 34:46.910
For something that
demon did. Not you.

34:46.954 --> 34:49.478
Look, I can't compartmentalize
like you can, Macy.

34:49.522 --> 34:53.134
That's where
we're different.

34:53.178 --> 34:55.354
Who knows, maybe...

34:55.397 --> 34:58.313
that would've broken us up
sooner or later anyway.

35:00.359 --> 35:03.318
Wow.
I'm sorry.

35:03.362 --> 35:05.146
Maybe I'm just...

35:05.190 --> 35:07.627
trying to make this easier.

35:07.670 --> 35:08.932
Letting you go.

35:08.976 --> 35:12.327
♪ How long it won't be claimed

35:12.371 --> 35:14.373
♪ Till it's time

35:14.416 --> 35:17.680
♪ So you can fly

35:17.724 --> 35:20.727
♪ So you can...

35:22.729 --> 35:26.602
Oh, my God. Tessa's dead?

35:26.646 --> 35:27.603
Yeah.

35:27.647 --> 35:29.257
I'm sorry I left
you hanging,

35:29.301 --> 35:31.477
but things are
getting really bad.

35:31.520 --> 35:34.871
Your life must be complicated.It is.

35:34.915 --> 35:36.395
And it's always,
always dangerous,

35:36.438 --> 35:39.702
but especially now.

35:39.746 --> 35:43.402
Which is why you and
I can't hang out anymore.

35:43.445 --> 35:47.188
Please stop asking questions.

35:47.232 --> 35:48.798
Do you remember how I told you

35:48.842 --> 35:50.626
I changed careers two years ago?

35:50.670 --> 35:51.932
Yeah, well,

35:51.975 --> 35:53.803
that was sugarcoating it.

35:53.847 --> 35:57.024
I... kind of had
a nervous breakdown,

35:57.067 --> 35:58.199
I guess you'd say.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.247
The thing is, I think
something happened

36:02.290 --> 36:03.987
to me two years ago.

36:04.031 --> 36:07.817
Some sort of trauma changed
who I was supposed to be.

36:08.905 --> 36:10.385
Oh, no.

36:10.429 --> 36:11.691
But now that I know
magic is real,

36:11.734 --> 36:13.388
I can't help but feel

36:13.432 --> 36:15.390
that there's some sort of
supernatural explanation

36:15.434 --> 36:16.391
for all of it.

36:16.435 --> 36:17.740
Are you sure?

36:17.784 --> 36:21.527
No.

36:21.570 --> 36:24.573
But knowing about magic
is a path to try to find out.

36:24.617 --> 36:27.185
No matter how dangerous it is.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.585
I brought this for you.What is it?

36:36.629 --> 36:40.110
This ring will protect
you from all magic.

36:40.154 --> 36:42.156
How does it work?

36:42.200 --> 36:45.028
Watch.

36:48.641 --> 36:50.164
Oh, my God.

36:51.600 --> 36:52.732
Oh, my God! You just...

36:54.560 --> 36:57.302
You pressed "pause" on... life!

37:02.350 --> 37:04.700
Have you ever frozen me?

37:04.744 --> 37:06.789
Wait, of course you have.

37:06.833 --> 37:08.791
This makes so much sense.

37:08.835 --> 37:11.446
I can't believe it.

37:11.490 --> 37:13.927
You know, I could just take off
all my clothes right now

37:13.970 --> 37:15.537
and all these people
would have no idea.

37:15.581 --> 37:17.278
You could.

37:31.727 --> 37:34.164
So I could try to figure out
what happened to me

37:34.208 --> 37:36.036
without getting, you know...

37:36.079 --> 37:37.820
stomped by Bigfoot?

37:37.864 --> 37:40.954
As far as I know,
Bigfoot is not real.

37:42.564 --> 37:45.959
It won't change what happened
to you in the past.

37:47.700 --> 37:49.658
But it might help you
move forward.

38:03.759 --> 38:06.719
Prodigal son returns.

38:06.762 --> 38:08.938
I've been trying to find
any way out of this.

38:08.982 --> 38:10.462
But I can't.

38:12.855 --> 38:15.945
I can't escape my demon side.

38:15.989 --> 38:18.861
And no matter what I do...

38:18.905 --> 38:21.995
I will never be good.

38:22.038 --> 38:24.606
Now my mom is dead
and it's my fault, and I...

38:24.650 --> 38:27.000
I was fond of her, too.

38:28.784 --> 38:30.438
At one time.

38:33.746 --> 38:34.964
It's your human side

38:35.008 --> 38:37.184
that is torturing you,
don't you see?

38:37.227 --> 38:40.056
That's why you feel this...
shame, this pain.

38:40.100 --> 38:42.537
It's your human conscience.

38:42.581 --> 38:46.236
But there's a way out.

38:46.280 --> 38:49.544
It's always been
available to you,

38:49.588 --> 38:53.243
the demon...
born of a human.

38:55.289 --> 38:58.292
Take on the Source, son.

38:59.989 --> 39:04.951
Lose yourself in it,
and I promise you...

39:04.994 --> 39:06.561
nothing will ever
hurt you again.

39:27.147 --> 39:31.630
No return address?

39:31.673 --> 39:34.284
Oh. It's, um...

39:34.328 --> 39:36.112
it's from Parker.

39:38.114 --> 39:40.160
He's saying good-bye.

39:42.989 --> 39:46.471
"When I saw how
much I scared you,

39:46.514 --> 39:49.865
"when you pushed me away,

39:49.909 --> 39:52.651
I realized I had
nothing left to lose."

39:52.694 --> 39:54.522
I...

39:54.566 --> 39:55.871
I don't know

39:55.915 --> 39:57.264
what he's talking about.
I...

39:57.307 --> 39:58.961
pushed him away?

39:59.005 --> 40:01.181
I haven't even
seen him since...

40:01.224 --> 40:04.663
Hunter.

40:04.706 --> 40:08.275
I saw Hunter shape-shift
into Dr. Julia.

40:08.318 --> 40:11.713
What if he shifted
into you, too?

40:11.757 --> 40:14.324
To convince Parker he has
"nothing left to lose."

40:16.979 --> 40:20.374
Oh, God.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.463
Parker said as long
as he has me,

40:22.507 --> 40:25.727
the darkness can't take over,
but...

40:25.771 --> 40:27.555
if he thinks he has
nothing left to live for...

40:27.599 --> 40:29.688
There's nothing stopping him
from giving in

40:29.731 --> 40:31.820
to his demon side.

40:31.864 --> 40:34.736
And taking on the Source.

40:34.780 --> 40:37.260
Which is just what
Alistair wanted all along.

41:03.765 --> 41:07.377
Are you ready
to accept your destiny?

41:09.467 --> 41:11.860
I am.

41:11.904 --> 41:14.559
Then let it be so.

41:25.221 --> 41:27.615
Receive the power.
