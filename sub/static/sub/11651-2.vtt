26:36.560 --> 26:40.560
So you can keep them in your waistband.

26:43.640 --> 26:47.640
Thank you.

26:50.200 --> 26:51.800
It's, you know...

26:51.835 --> 26:55.800
something.

27:22.920 --> 27:26.920
Face the screen, please.

27:29.240 --> 27:32.480
Is he your Friends
And Family allocation?

27:33.720 --> 27:36.680
Hand, please.

27:36.715 --> 27:38.405
Oh!

27:38.440 --> 27:39.125
That's not permanent, is it?

27:39.160 --> 27:41.240
That's not permanent, is
it? Oh, no. Two months max.

27:41.275 --> 27:45.240
Round to the right,
and through the scanner.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.005
Where do we go now?

28:09.040 --> 28:12.280
Where do we go now? You wait here.

28:12.315 --> 28:16.280
How long?

28:18.320 --> 28:19.480
So, what do we do?

28:19.515 --> 28:20.757
I don't know.

28:20.792 --> 28:21.965
Hey, hey, hey.

28:22.000 --> 28:26.000
Hey, hey, hey. Fuck off.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.365
Her with the dark hair?

28:30.400 --> 28:32.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah. The pretty one.

28:32.435 --> 28:35.045
Yup. OK. Move.

28:35.080 --> 28:38.240
They want to preview you.

28:38.275 --> 28:39.325
What?

28:39.360 --> 28:40.520
What? Preview. Come on.

28:40.555 --> 28:41.285
He's with me.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.960
He's with me. Hand?

28:43.995 --> 28:46.600
Show me your hand.

28:46.800 --> 28:47.565
OK. You, too.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.920
OK. You, too. That's not fair.
She's new. That's not fair.

28:49.955 --> 28:51.885
I don't pick the order.

28:51.920 --> 28:54.445
I've waited here all week,
and she's just walked in.

28:54.480 --> 28:58.400
Everyone will get seen
eventually. I don't pick the order.

28:58.435 --> 28:59.845
But I'm a good singer.

28:59.880 --> 29:01.520
I can sing. I'm a good singer, I am.

29:01.555 --> 29:03.597
Stand aside.

29:03.632 --> 29:09.640
It's not fair!

29:12.760 --> 29:14.805
Next lot.

29:14.840 --> 29:18.840
Stand there.

29:19.520 --> 29:21.760
Would you like to be
as big as Salma one day?

29:21.795 --> 29:23.805
Erm...

29:23.840 --> 29:25.280
Yeah, I mean...

29:25.315 --> 29:26.685
Could you say that

29:26.720 --> 29:30.720
as a self-contained
sentence into that screen?

29:31.840 --> 29:34.360
I guess I'd like to be
as big as Salma one day.

29:34.395 --> 29:36.320
OK. Proceed to stage area.

29:36.355 --> 29:40.320
Are we done?

29:41.520 --> 29:42.560
Both performing?

29:42.595 --> 29:44.245
Just her.

29:44.280 --> 29:44.965
And what are you?

29:45.000 --> 29:46.160
And what are you? Singer.

29:46.195 --> 29:47.397
Compliance?

29:47.432 --> 29:48.565
No, thanks.

29:48.600 --> 29:51.500
A
- ha. Yes, thanks! It's compulsory for all contestants.

29:51.535 --> 29:54.365
More to the point, it'll
stop you puking with nerves.

29:54.400 --> 29:55.325
More to the point, it'll stop you
puking with nerves. She's got to perform.

29:55.360 --> 29:56.560
More to the point, it'll stop you puking
with nerves. She's got to perform. Well, mmm

29:56.595 --> 30:00.560
Look, just sip it, you'll be fine.

30:03.320 --> 30:05.320
Just a touch of light foam. It'll pass.

30:05.355 --> 30:07.365
Make the most of it.

30:07.400 --> 30:08.445
You can't get this stuff anywhere else.

30:08.480 --> 30:10.200
You can't get this stuff
anywhere else. You OK?

30:10.235 --> 30:10.845
Yeah.

30:10.880 --> 30:14.880
Yeah. You OK?

30:15.440 --> 30:16.725
Yeah. Just, erm...

30:16.760 --> 30:20.360
I don't know. Things
are just wider apart.

30:20.395 --> 30:21.365
I'm fine.

30:21.400 --> 30:23.540
I'm fine. Really?

30:23.575 --> 30:26.627
Yeah, I'm fine.

30:26.662 --> 30:29.680
Right. You're on.

30:44.520 --> 30:48.520
A little closer, please.

30:50.720 --> 30:54.720
Little closer.

30:55.200 --> 30:59.200
Into the light, love.

31:05.320 --> 31:07.360
And who're we looking at here?

31:07.395 --> 31:09.405
Abi Khan.

31:09.440 --> 31:11.760
What are you going to
do for us today, Abi?

31:11.795 --> 31:13.277
I'm going to sing.

31:13.312 --> 31:14.725
You speak up, love.

31:14.760 --> 31:18.080
You speak up, love. We don't bite.

31:18.115 --> 31:20.045
I'm going to sing.

31:20.080 --> 31:23.720
Hey, would you mind
lifting up your top for me?

31:23.755 --> 31:25.685
Can you take off your top?

31:25.720 --> 31:28.640
I want to check out those titties.

31:31.720 --> 31:35.000
Come on. Mucho feranto.

31:35.035 --> 31:37.805
Ah! No titties?

31:37.840 --> 31:40.805
She says she's here to sing.

31:40.840 --> 31:43.160
I got to see those titties, though.

31:43.195 --> 31:44.557
Come on, girl.

31:44.592 --> 31:45.996
I mean, damn!

31:49.080 --> 31:53.080

That was...

34:21.120 --> 34:25.005
.. without a doubt...

34:25.040 --> 34:28.840
.. probably the best piece of
singing we've had this season.

34:28.875 --> 34:31.320
Yes! Well done!

34:36.239 --> 34:40.239
Fair play.

34:40.840 --> 34:42.400
But I have to say...

34:44.679 --> 34:47.440
No. No, no, no. I have to say,

34:47.475 --> 34:48.645
actually,

34:48.679 --> 34:51.645
I'm with Rafe on this one.

34:51.679 --> 34:54.600
Good though your voice is
- and it is good.

34:54.635 --> 34:57.520
It's not the most magical
sound in the world.

34:57.555 --> 34:59.485
It's just... good.

34:59.520 --> 35:02.940
I don't think anyone's
really hearing it.

35:02.975 --> 35:06.360
Certainly not the guys in the audience.

35:06.640 --> 35:09.240
These looks you got going
on kind of get in the way.

35:09.275 --> 35:12.320
Men will want you. Women will hate you.

35:12.355 --> 35:14.937
All the time you're on stage.

35:14.972 --> 35:17.520
Couldn't help picturing you.

35:17.555 --> 35:20.805
In an erotic scenario.

35:20.840 --> 35:24.840
Getting pretty turned on, if I'm honest.

35:27.240 --> 35:28.645
Right.

35:28.680 --> 35:30.685
You've got this pure beauty

35:30.720 --> 35:33.525
What seems to be a knockout figure.

35:33.560 --> 35:36.560
And this sort of interesting
innocence going on.

35:36.595 --> 35:39.560
That's something I think
Rafe's erotica channels

35:39.595 --> 35:40.885
could really play with.

35:40.920 --> 35:43.440
Absolutely. That's what I thought

35:43.475 --> 35:44.840
the moment I saw you.

35:44.875 --> 35:46.285
The moment.

35:46.320 --> 35:49.560
I'd watch. I don't know
a man here who wouldn't.

35:49.595 --> 35:52.800
To be honest, some of
us girls might join you.

35:55.632 --> 35:58.056
Get off me!

35:58.091 --> 36:00.245
Don't! Abi!

36:00.280 --> 36:02.365
No! Abi! Abi!

36:02.400 --> 36:06.400
I don't think that's quite...

36:07.200 --> 36:11.200
You will never have to
pedal again. Not one minute.

36:13.240 --> 36:15.485
We could really work with you.

36:15.520 --> 36:19.240
Last year we had
singers, singers, singers.

36:19.275 --> 36:20.565
So many singers.

36:20.600 --> 36:23.720
So, to be a singer you
have to be truly exceptional

36:23.755 --> 36:26.840
There's just no slots left
for an above average singer.

36:26.875 --> 36:29.560
Not for the next few
years, at least. Charity?

36:29.595 --> 36:32.737
No. Saturation point, singer-wise.

36:32.772 --> 36:35.845
Listen. We said, right from the start.

36:35.880 --> 36:38.440
We'll go with something
different this season.

36:38.475 --> 36:42.125
That's why he's on the panel!

36:42.160 --> 36:45.000
She would be a star on our stream.

36:45.035 --> 36:46.817
A star.

36:46.852 --> 36:48.565
On his...

36:48.600 --> 36:51.245
You're furniture, at best.

36:51.280 --> 36:54.160
Forget about all the shame,
and all that ppht-ppht-tew.

36:54.195 --> 36:56.565
We medicate against that.

36:56.600 --> 36:58.765
You will have pleasure forever.

36:58.800 --> 37:01.840
Realistically, sweetheart, it is that,

37:01.875 --> 37:05.725
or the bike.

37:05.760 --> 37:08.605
I, I don't think...

37:08.640 --> 37:10.325
This is starting to annoy me.

37:10.360 --> 37:14.360
Who do you think is
powering that spotlight?

37:19.520 --> 37:22.500
Millions of people. That's who.

37:22.535 --> 37:25.007
All of them, out there, right now.

37:25.042 --> 37:27.445
Putting in an honest day on the bike,

37:27.480 --> 37:30.080
while you stand in the
light they're generating

37:30.115 --> 37:31.637
and dither.

37:31.672 --> 37:33.125
You know what?

37:33.160 --> 37:37.160
They would give anything. Do
anything to be where you are now.

37:38.200 --> 37:42.085
Am I right?!

37:42.120 --> 37:46.120
You want to cock a snook at all
that, as though it's nothing.

37:46.760 --> 37:49.540
As though they're nothing.

37:49.575 --> 37:52.367
And that makes me sick.

37:52.402 --> 37:55.125
But, you know what?

37:55.160 --> 37:57.125
Maybe you do belong on the bike.

37:57.160 --> 38:01.160
Because you don't seem to be
very willing to step off it.

38:02.800 --> 38:04.605
I do want to.

38:04.640 --> 38:06.645
We have a decision?

38:06.680 --> 38:10.680
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

38:21.760 --> 38:29.080
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

38:40.440 --> 38:43.100
I suppose.

38:50.080 --> 38:52.560
Woo-hoo-hoo!
Go on!

38:52.595 --> 39:19.000
Well done!

45:04.320 --> 45:08.320
'The hottest girls... '

48:43.320 --> 48:47.320
Could you stand aside, please?

48:50.120 --> 48:52.045
Come up into the back,
in front of me, please.

48:52.080 --> 48:56.080
Come up into the back, in front
of me, please. Are you messin'?

49:00.600 --> 49:02.765
A what-nic one?

49:02.800 --> 49:06.800
Oh, an eth-nic one! Aah!

49:06.960 --> 49:08.325
On it.

49:08.360 --> 49:12.360
We're going to preview, all right?
Want to follow me in the back?

49:13.080 --> 49:17.080
You're a prick!

49:18.560 --> 49:21.640
Next, lot.

49:21.675 --> 49:24.720
Stand there!

49:25.200 --> 49:28.960
So what are you, a magician?

49:28.995 --> 49:30.325
An entertainer.

49:30.360 --> 49:34.360
Could you say that down the screen
as a self-contained sentence?

49:35.600 --> 49:39.600
I'm an entertainer.

49:44.960 --> 49:47.600
Ah, before you go on, you
need to drink a compliance.

49:47.635 --> 49:48.405
They give me one back there.

49:48.440 --> 49:50.120
They give me one back
there. Really? Oh, OK.

49:50.155 --> 49:52.720
Well, in that case, you are good to...

49:52.755 --> 49:56.720
go.

50:08.800 --> 50:10.220
Who are you?

50:10.255 --> 50:11.605
Bing Madsen.

50:11.640 --> 50:14.600
What are you planning to do for us?

50:14.635 --> 50:15.485
What the fuck?!

50:15.520 --> 50:17.280
What the fuck?! 'A
sort of performance. '

50:17.315 --> 50:19.320
A sort of performance?

50:19.355 --> 50:21.045
Yes.

50:21.080 --> 50:23.800
Mmm! Man of mystery!

50:23.835 --> 50:27.800
Hmm.

50:27.880 --> 50:31.040
Well, I suppose we'd better see it.

50:31.075 --> 50:33.925
OK.

51:13.200 --> 51:16.040
Knob'ead!

51:16.075 --> 51:18.880
Fucking cock!

51:30.280 --> 51:34.280
Stop or I'll do it. This is a main
artery. Keep walking, you kill me.

51:37.960 --> 51:40.080
No-one stops me till
I've said my piece.

51:40.115 --> 51:42.017
Then you can do what you like.

51:42.052 --> 51:43.885
Man, just fucking kill yourself.

51:43.920 --> 51:46.800
Get heavy on me, I swear to God,
I kick your ass back to life,

51:46.835 --> 51:48.880
just so I could cut
your goddamn head off.

51:50.915 --> 51:54.880
Go on!

51:55.880 --> 51:57.680
I think we should let him speak.

51:59.040 --> 52:03.040
Speak! Speak! Speak! Speak! Speak!

52:04.960 --> 52:06.920
Let's hear what he has to say.

52:09.792 --> 52:11.696
Well?

52:11.731 --> 52:13.565
Come on.

52:13.600 --> 52:15.960
Got our attention, as requested.

52:15.995 --> 52:19.960
What do you want to say?

52:23.480 --> 52:27.480
Have you prepared a speech, is that it?

52:27.880 --> 52:28.885
Speak!

52:28.920 --> 52:31.200
I haven't got a speech.
I didn't plan words.

52:31.235 --> 52:32.565
I didn't even try to...

52:32.600 --> 52:35.160
I just knew I had to
get here, to stand here,

52:35.195 --> 52:36.605
and I wanted you to listen.

52:36.640 --> 52:39.760
To really listen, not just pull
a face like you're listening,

52:39.795 --> 52:41.365
like you do the rest of the time.

52:41.400 --> 52:43.820
A face that you're feeling
instead of processing.

52:43.855 --> 52:46.205
You pull a face, and
poke it towards the stage,

52:46.240 --> 52:50.240
and we lah-di-dah, we sing
and dance and tumble around.

52:50.760 --> 52:53.005
And all you see up
here, it's not people,

52:53.040 --> 52:55.620
you don't see people up
here, it's all fodder.

52:55.655 --> 52:58.165
And the faker the fodder,
the more you love it,

52:58.200 --> 53:00.820
because fake fodder's the
only thing that works any more.

53:00.855 --> 53:03.440
It's all that we can stomach.
Actually, not quite all.

53:03.475 --> 53:05.760
Real pain, real viciousness,
that, we can take.

53:05.795 --> 53:07.445
Yeah, stick a fat man up a pole.

53:07.480 --> 53:10.320
We laugh ourselves feral,
because we've earned the right,

53:10.355 --> 53:12.720
we've done cell time and
he's slacking, the scum,

53:12.755 --> 53:13.725
so ha-ha-ha
at him!

53:13.760 --> 53:17.320
Because we're so out of
our minds with desperation,

53:17.355 --> 53:18.685
we don't know any better.

53:18.720 --> 53:20.920
All we know is fake
fodder and buying shit.

53:20.955 --> 53:22.685
That's how we speak to each other,

53:22.720 --> 53:25.240
how we express
ourselves, is buying shit.

53:25.275 --> 53:26.325
What, I have a dream?

53:26.360 --> 53:29.960
The peak of our dreams is a new app
for our Dopple, it doesn't exist!

53:29.995 --> 53:32.045
It's not even there!

53:32.080 --> 53:33.805
We buy shit that's not even there.

53:33.840 --> 53:37.040
Show us something real and free
and beautiful. You couldn't.

53:37.075 --> 53:38.597
Yeah? It'd break us.

53:38.632 --> 53:40.116
We're too numb for it.

53:40.151 --> 53:41.565
I might as well choke.

53:41.600 --> 53:43.605
It's only so much wonder we can bear.

53:43.640 --> 53:47.640
When you find any wonder whatsoever,
you dole it out in meagre portions.

53:48.000 --> 53:52.000
Only then until it's augmented, packaged,
and pumped through 10,000 preassigned filters

53:52.320 --> 53:55.240
till it's nothing more than a
meaningless series of lights,

53:55.275 --> 53:58.640
while we ride day in
day out, going where?

53:58.675 --> 54:01.405
Powering what?

54:01.440 --> 54:04.320
All tiny cells and tiny
screens and bigger cells

54:04.355 --> 54:06.245
and bigger screens and fuck you!

54:06.280 --> 54:09.165
Fuck you, that's what it boils down to.

54:09.200 --> 54:13.200
Fuck you for sitting there
and slowly making things worse.

54:13.720 --> 54:17.520
Fuck you and your spotlight
and your sanctimonious faces.

54:17.555 --> 54:19.797
Fuck you all for thinking the one thing

54:19.832 --> 54:22.005
I came close to never meant anything.

54:22.040 --> 54:26.040
For oozing around it and crushing
it into a bone, into a joke.

54:27.040 --> 54:30.440
One more ugly joke in
a kingdom of millions.

54:30.475 --> 54:33.045
Fuck you for happening.

54:33.080 --> 54:37.080
Fuck you for me, for us, for everyone.

54:37.480 --> 54:39.880
Fuck you!

55:00.560 --> 55:04.560
That was, without a doubt,

55:04.640 --> 55:08.640
the most heartfelt thing
I've seen on this stage

55:08.840 --> 55:11.560
since Hotshot began!

55:16.760 --> 55:18.480
Brilliant!

55:18.515 --> 55:20.165
You...

55:20.200 --> 55:23.360
you're so articulating something we all,

55:23.395 --> 55:26.160
and I mean everyone in this hall,

55:26.195 --> 55:28.445
something we all agree on.

55:28.480 --> 55:32.040
Even though we may not
comprehend all of it.

55:32.075 --> 55:35.600
I think I'm right in
saying we do feel it.

55:35.635 --> 55:37.925
Even me.

55:37.960 --> 55:41.040
I know you've got me
down as this creature.

55:41.075 --> 55:44.005
You know, hey...

55:44.040 --> 55:46.520
I get where you're coming from.

55:46.555 --> 55:47.997
I like your stuff.

55:48.032 --> 55:49.405
It's not stuff.

55:49.440 --> 55:52.685
It's truth. Am I right?

55:52.720 --> 55:56.720
Your truth, admittedly,
but truth nonetheless.

55:57.440 --> 55:59.045
And you're right.

55:59.080 --> 56:03.080
Authenticity is in
woefully short supply.

56:04.880 --> 56:08.880
I'd like to hear you talk again.

56:10.280 --> 56:11.645
How so?

56:11.680 --> 56:14.925
The slot on one of my streams

56:14.960 --> 56:18.960
where you can talk just like that.

56:20.600 --> 56:22.605
I'd watch it.

56:22.640 --> 56:26.640
It was such great passion.

56:26.720 --> 56:30.520
He's a'right. You're a
little hot there, bud.

56:30.555 --> 56:33.640
That throat cutting thing? Neat gimmick.

56:33.675 --> 56:35.717
What do you say?

56:35.752 --> 56:37.760
30 minutes twice a week?

56:40.120 --> 56:44.120
Do it, do it, do it!
Do it, do it, do it!

Do it, do it, do it!
Do it, do it, do it!

56:51.640 --> 56:55.140
Do it, do it, do it!

56:55.175 --> 56:58.605
Go on, you bastard.
