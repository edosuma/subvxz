What the hell?

00:14.441 --> 00:16.140
Emergency preparedness drill.

00:16.142 --> 00:18.592
- Oh, no, come on!
- Yeah, you know how it works.

00:18.594 --> 00:21.229
Once a quarter,
keep our readiness up.

00:21.231 --> 00:23.481
Now, rise and shine,
sleepy head.

00:23.483 --> 00:26.067
Half the town is probably dead.

00:26.069 --> 00:30.087
I have to get
a lock for my door.

00:30.089 --> 00:32.122
I think you'll like
the drill tonight.

00:32.125 --> 00:33.658
I've tried to make it fun.

00:33.660 --> 00:34.992
Each of these cards

00:34.994 --> 00:38.629
contains a detailed scenario
of a possible apocalyptic event.

00:38.631 --> 00:40.748
Everything from wild fires

00:40.750 --> 00:44.168
to a surprise invasion
by Canada.

00:44.170 --> 00:46.721
Pick a catastrophe,
any catastrophe.

00:47.789 --> 00:52.793
Sheldon, Canada is not going
to invade California.

00:52.795 --> 00:54.362
Yeah, really?
You think those hippies

00:54.364 --> 00:56.998
in Washington and Oregon
can stop them?

00:58.133 --> 01:00.084
Fine.

01:00.936 --> 01:02.136
All righty!

01:02.138 --> 01:05.823
"An 8.2 magnitude earthquake
devastates Pasadena,

01:05.825 --> 01:07.775
"reducing mighty
edifices to dust,

01:07.777 --> 01:09.827
"engulfing the city in flames.

01:09.829 --> 01:11.478
"The streets flow with blood

01:11.480 --> 01:13.531
and echo with the cries
of the wounded."

01:13.533 --> 01:15.249
Oh, excellent choice.

01:15.251 --> 01:17.535
Now, put on your hardhat
and safety vest.

01:17.537 --> 01:18.836
Oh, fun.

01:18.838 --> 01:21.655
I get to spend another night
in front of our apartment

01:21.657 --> 01:24.592
dressed like one
of the Village People.

01:24.594 --> 01:26.427
You make that joke
every three months.

01:26.429 --> 01:27.628
I still don't get it.

01:27.630 --> 01:29.964
Leonard... wait.

01:29.966 --> 01:30.932
What are you doing?

01:30.934 --> 01:33.518
I don't know,
what am I doing?

01:33.520 --> 01:34.685
Look around you--

01:34.687 --> 01:38.055
there's hypothetical
broken glass everywhere.

01:38.057 --> 01:40.174
Really? You're going
to face Armageddon

01:40.176 --> 01:41.809
without your orthotics?

01:41.811 --> 01:44.512
Your choice.

01:44.514 --> 01:46.847
Uh-oh, hypothetical aftershock!

01:48.151 --> 01:49.200
Aah!

01:49.202 --> 01:51.485

Check it out--
press release

02:22.954 --> 02:24.254
from NASA.

02:24.256 --> 02:26.690
Um, "Expedition 31
will launch this spring

02:26.692 --> 02:28.558
"to the International
Space Station.

02:28.560 --> 02:32.095
"Crew members will include
Commander Tom 'Tombo' Johnson,

02:32.097 --> 02:34.731
"Astronaut
Mike 'Supernova' Novacelik

02:34.733 --> 02:37.332
and Payload Specialist
Howard Wolowitz."

02:38.303 --> 02:42.572
This is going right into
my synagogue's newsletter.

02:43.574 --> 02:44.991
D-Dude, if you're
going to be an astronaut,

02:44.993 --> 02:47.243
you need to pick
a cool nickname.

02:47.245 --> 02:48.244
I don't get to pick it.

02:48.246 --> 02:49.829
The other guys
have to give it to me.

02:49.831 --> 02:53.850
Oh. If I had one,
it would be "Brown Dynamite."

02:54.803 --> 02:56.204
Are you not listening to me?

02:56.223 --> 02:59.056
The other astronauts
have to give you your nickname.

02:59.657 --> 03:00.957
Are you not looking at me?

03:00.959 --> 03:02.776
I <i>am</i> Brown Dynamite.

03:05.046 --> 03:07.997
Why do you put six
sugars in your coffee?

03:07.999 --> 03:09.832
Because the cafeteria
doesn't offer

03:09.834 --> 03:13.219
little packets
of methamphetamine.

03:13.221 --> 03:15.171
Emergency drill night
last night, huh?

03:15.173 --> 03:17.057
- Uh-huh.
- How'd you do?

03:17.059 --> 03:19.392
I'll tell you
exactly how he did.

03:19.394 --> 03:21.511
"Readiness:
unsatisfactory.

03:21.513 --> 03:23.813
"Follows direction: barely.

03:23.815 --> 03:26.316
"Attitude: a little too much.

03:26.318 --> 03:28.151
"Overall:

03:28.153 --> 03:31.488
"not only will he probably die
in a fiery inferno,

03:31.490 --> 03:34.040
"his incessant whining
would most certainly spoil

03:34.042 --> 03:36.209
everyone else's day."

03:37.294 --> 03:39.462
You know what, I can't
even think straight.

03:39.464 --> 03:40.696
I'm going home.

03:40.698 --> 03:44.167
Will one of you guys give
this nutbag a ride back later?

03:44.169 --> 03:45.218
You can't go home.

03:45.220 --> 03:47.703
You have to take me
to the dentist at 4:00.

03:47.705 --> 03:50.173
Oh... can't you take
the bus to the dentist?

03:50.175 --> 03:51.874
Of course I can.
It's coming back,

03:51.876 --> 03:53.709
under the residual effects
of the anesthesia,

03:53.711 --> 03:54.928
that's the problem.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.379
Two years ago,

03:56.381 --> 03:59.065
after a deep gum cleaning,
I thought I got on a bus

03:59.067 --> 04:02.068
but somehow wound up
on a booze cruise to Mexico.

04:03.771 --> 04:06.389
They put you under
for a cleaning?

04:06.391 --> 04:08.908
Yeah, they have to--
I'm a biter.

04:08.910 --> 04:10.944
Whatever, Sheldon.
I'm exhausted.

04:10.946 --> 04:12.996
I'm not taking you
to the dentist.

04:12.998 --> 04:14.280
Wrong, sir.

04:14.282 --> 04:17.834
Wrong. Under section 37-B
of the Roommate Agreement--

04:17.836 --> 04:19.836
"Miscellaneous Duties"--
you are obligated

04:19.838 --> 04:21.404
to take me to the dentist.

04:21.406 --> 04:24.574
See? It's right here after
"providing a confirmation sniff

04:24.576 --> 04:27.293
on questionable dairy products."

04:27.295 --> 04:31.214
You know what, I am sick
of the Roommate Agreement.

04:33.385 --> 04:34.634
It's ridiculous.

04:34.636 --> 04:36.636
I'm your roommate,
not your chauffeur.

04:36.638 --> 04:38.805
You know, I had
better things to do yesterday

04:38.807 --> 04:41.691
than drive you all the way
to the "good" model train store

04:41.693 --> 04:43.693
in Garden Grove
because the one in Pasadena

04:43.695 --> 04:46.696
has gotten
"too big for its britches."

04:46.698 --> 04:48.598
Well, it <i>has.</i>

04:48.600 --> 04:50.266
Ask anybody.

04:50.268 --> 04:51.484
I don't care.

04:51.486 --> 04:52.485
I'm done.

04:52.487 --> 04:53.820
Hold on.

04:53.822 --> 04:57.157
Are you saying that you
want to invoke Clause 209?

04:57.159 --> 04:58.541
I don't know what that is,

04:58.543 --> 05:01.127
but if it means I can go home
and sleep, then yes.

05:01.129 --> 05:02.128
Think carefully here.

05:02.130 --> 05:04.214
Clause 209 suspends
our friendship,

05:04.216 --> 05:05.774
and strips down the
Roommate Agreement to

05:05.799 --> 05:07.099
its bare essentials.

05:07.169 --> 05:08.512
Our responsibilities
toward each other would

05:08.537 --> 05:10.517
only be rent, utilities

05:10.722 --> 05:13.056
and a perfunctory
chin jut of recognition

05:13.058 --> 05:14.340
as we pass in the hall.

05:14.342 --> 05:15.959
'Sup?

05:19.129 --> 05:21.648
Where do I sign?

05:21.650 --> 05:23.683
Right here.

05:23.685 --> 05:25.418
Use your finger.

05:26.187 --> 05:28.471
There. Done.
All right.

05:28.473 --> 05:31.024
That's it. We are
now no longer companions,

05:31.026 --> 05:32.659
boon or otherwise.

05:32.661 --> 05:34.477
We are not merely
acquaintances.

05:34.479 --> 05:36.613
To amend the words
of <i>Toy Story--</i>

05:36.615 --> 05:40.583
"You have not got
a friend in me."

05:40.585 --> 05:41.868
I'm gonna go home
and take a nap.

05:41.870 --> 05:44.921
Yeah, well, tell it
to someone who cares.

05:46.090 --> 05:48.508
I got pretty exciting
NASA news today.

05:48.510 --> 05:51.160
Next week I fly to Houston
for orientation

05:51.162 --> 05:54.464
and zero-gravity
elimination drills.

05:54.466 --> 05:55.515
What does that mean?

05:55.517 --> 05:58.334
He's gonna learn
to poop in space.

05:59.970 --> 06:03.005
Open the pod bay
doors, HAL.

06:04.058 --> 06:07.694
Maybe <i>your</i> nickname
should be "Brown Dynamite."

06:10.281 --> 06:12.282
Hello, dear friends.

06:12.284 --> 06:14.534
And Dr. Hofstadter.

06:15.402 --> 06:17.570
'Sup?

06:17.572 --> 06:19.789
'Sup?

06:19.791 --> 06:21.407
My apologies.

06:21.409 --> 06:22.709
I would've been here sooner,

06:22.711 --> 06:26.028
but the bus kept stopping
for other people to get on it.

06:26.030 --> 06:28.414
I saved you a dumpling.

06:28.416 --> 06:30.550
Oh, your concern
for me is touching.

06:30.552 --> 06:31.885
It will serve you well

06:31.887 --> 06:34.370
when you take me to
the dentist tomorrow.

06:34.372 --> 06:35.871
I'm sorry, Sheldon, I'm busy.

06:35.873 --> 06:38.091
I'm right in the middle
of my addiction study.

06:38.093 --> 06:40.193
I've got a lab
full of alcoholic monkeys,

06:40.195 --> 06:43.162
and tomorrow's the day
we switch them to O'Doul's.

06:43.164 --> 06:44.614
You're my girlfriend

06:44.616 --> 06:47.283
and you're not going to cater
to my every need?

06:47.285 --> 06:49.986
Oh, where'd the magic go?

06:51.055 --> 06:53.022
Sheldon, that's not
what girlfriends are for.

06:53.024 --> 06:55.391
Although, you don't use them
for what they're for,

06:55.393 --> 06:57.160
so what do <i>I</i> know?

07:03.033 --> 07:05.118
Howard doesn't make
me do his shopping

07:05.120 --> 07:06.753
or take him to the dentist

07:06.755 --> 07:08.671
or pick up his
dry cleaning, right?

07:08.673 --> 07:10.072
Absolutely.

07:10.074 --> 07:12.842
But when Ma's hips
give out, you're up, kid.

07:14.044 --> 07:16.930
Well, if Amy's too busy,
that gives the rest of you

07:16.932 --> 07:19.081
an opportunity to
make my life easier,

07:19.083 --> 07:20.216
thus assuring yourselves

07:20.218 --> 07:21.968
a footnote in my memoirs,

07:21.970 --> 07:25.221
tentatively entitled
<i>You're Welcome, Mankind.</i>

07:25.223 --> 07:26.556
All right, then,

07:26.558 --> 07:29.392
just shout when you hear
the task you want to undertake.

07:29.394 --> 07:30.944
Uh, dentist.

07:34.898 --> 07:37.283
Okay, w-we can
circle back to that one.

07:37.285 --> 07:39.786
Um, well, who wants
to take me Wednesday morning

07:39.788 --> 07:42.622
to get new heels
put on my dress shoes?

07:45.993 --> 07:47.109
Anyone?

07:47.111 --> 07:49.779
Oh. That one had hoot
written all over it.

07:49.781 --> 07:52.465
Um, all right,
uh, dermatologist.

07:55.285 --> 07:57.453
Allergist.

07:58.138 --> 08:01.074
Podiatrist.

08:01.076 --> 08:02.976
Supercuts?

08:02.978 --> 08:05.561
Okay, okay, here's a fun one.

08:05.563 --> 08:07.797
Um, I need a new picture frame

08:07.799 --> 08:10.483
<i>and</i> I have a hankering
for Swedish meatballs.

08:10.485 --> 08:13.653
Who wants to spend the day
with me at IKEA?

08:15.155 --> 08:16.689
Their meatballs
are pretty good.

08:16.691 --> 08:17.323
What's that?

08:17.325 --> 08:18.574
Nothing, nothing.

08:20.944 --> 08:22.662
Hello, Stuart.

08:22.664 --> 08:24.313
Oh, hey, Sheldon.

08:24.315 --> 08:25.948
Can I help you find
something today?

08:25.950 --> 08:27.450
No, no.

08:27.452 --> 08:28.651
I was just sitting at home

08:28.653 --> 08:30.787
thinking about how it
might be nice to catch up

08:30.789 --> 08:32.288
with my ninth favorite person.

08:32.289 --> 08:34.289
Ninth?

08:34.292 --> 08:36.292
You moved up one.

08:36.294 --> 08:39.828
My pen pal in Somalia
was kidnapped by pirates.

08:41.597 --> 08:43.349
So, uh... how are you?

08:43.351 --> 08:45.134
Uh... not so good.

08:45.136 --> 08:48.221
My shrink just
killed himself and...

08:48.223 --> 08:50.623
blamed me in the note.

08:52.976 --> 08:55.177
Great. Great.

08:56.447 --> 08:58.481
So, what's new
with your family?

08:58.483 --> 09:00.700
How's your mother?
Is she alive?

09:00.702 --> 09:02.201
Yeah.

09:02.203 --> 09:04.771
And your father? Alive?

09:04.773 --> 09:05.872
Yes.

09:05.874 --> 09:07.657
How about your grandparents,
they alive?

09:07.659 --> 09:09.876
No.

09:09.878 --> 09:11.444
Oh, I'm so sorry for your loss.

09:12.529 --> 09:13.746
On a cheerier note,

09:13.748 --> 09:17.050
I have a teeth-cleaning
appointment this afternoon.

09:17.052 --> 09:21.036
What do you say you
take me over there, buddy boy?

09:21.038 --> 09:23.840
I'm sorry, you want me
to take you to the dentist?

09:23.842 --> 09:25.925
Yes. Now, I can't
make any promises,

09:25.927 --> 09:27.343
but that's the sort of thing

09:27.345 --> 09:29.412
that gets a fella
on the short list

09:29.414 --> 09:32.148
for the number eight
friend slot.

09:32.150 --> 09:33.449
Sheldon, I'm working.

09:33.451 --> 09:35.384
I can't take you
to the dentist.

09:35.386 --> 09:38.154
Also-- and I can't
stress this enough--

09:38.156 --> 09:41.257
I don't <i>want</i> to take you
to the dentist.

09:41.259 --> 09:44.243
Can't help a friend out
in a time of need, huh?

09:44.245 --> 09:46.646
I see where your
therapist was coming from.

09:55.945 --> 09:59.614
Ooh, ooh! What about we
make your astronaut nickname

09:59.616 --> 10:02.984
Howard "Buzz" Wolowitz?

10:02.986 --> 10:04.986
You can't do "Buzz."

10:04.988 --> 10:06.555
"Buzz" is taken.

10:06.557 --> 10:09.307
Buzz Lightyear is not real.

10:11.360 --> 10:14.846
No, that's not what
I'm talking about.

10:14.848 --> 10:17.983
Well, are you talking about
when he <i>thought</i> he was real?

10:20.786 --> 10:23.054
No.

10:23.056 --> 10:25.290
Okay, um...
how about "Crash"?

10:25.292 --> 10:27.458
Howard "Crash" Wolowitz.

10:28.561 --> 10:30.128
Yeah, terrific.
The other astronauts

10:30.130 --> 10:32.130
would love to go hurtling
through space

10:32.132 --> 10:33.632
with a guy named "Crash."

10:33.634 --> 10:36.484
All right, um, how about...

10:36.486 --> 10:39.137
Oh, how about "Rocket Man"?

10:40.606 --> 10:43.024
That's not bad,
Howard "Rocket Man" Wolowitz.

10:43.026 --> 10:44.776
Yeah, it's great,
but I told you,

10:44.778 --> 10:46.244
I don't get to pick
my nickname.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.113
It has to come from
the other astronauts.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.532
Maybe there's a way to get
them to come up with it.

10:50.534 --> 10:52.500
Like how?

10:52.502 --> 10:54.502
Once I tried carrying
around a Duncan yo-yo,

10:54.504 --> 10:57.655
hoping the other kids would
start calling me Duncan.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.457
Did it work?

10:59.459 --> 11:02.611
No, they ended up
calling me Sock Mouth.

11:03.546 --> 11:04.996
Because they took away my yo-yo

11:04.998 --> 11:06.998
and stuffed their socks
in my mouth.

11:09.268 --> 11:13.021
Okay, uh, what if we make
"Rocket Man" your ringtone,

11:13.023 --> 11:15.557
and the next time you
talk to those guys,

11:15.559 --> 11:17.175
I'll call you and
they'll hear it.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.810
Plant the seed.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.679
That's actually not
a terrible plan.

11:20.681 --> 11:24.182
They don't call me
"Brown Dynamite" for nothing.

11:26.369 --> 11:27.319
'Sup?

11:27.321 --> 11:28.787
'Sup?

11:29.989 --> 11:31.823
Hey, did you ever make it
to the dentist?

11:31.825 --> 11:33.124
Not necessary. No.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.660
I found a service that'll
send a van to your house

11:35.662 --> 11:37.045
for a teeth cleaning.

11:37.047 --> 11:39.214
Mostly they cater
to dogs, but...

11:41.133 --> 11:43.551
...the fellow on the phone
seemed to have an open mind.

11:43.553 --> 11:45.420
All right, Sheldon,

11:45.422 --> 11:47.472
if you need me to take you
to the dentist,

11:47.474 --> 11:48.840
I will take you to the dentist.

11:48.842 --> 11:51.393
Are you suggesting that
you've come to your senses

11:51.395 --> 11:54.229
and wish to reestablish
the mutual benefits that stem

11:54.231 --> 11:56.231
from full participation
in the Roommate Agreement?

11:56.233 --> 11:57.382
Absolutely.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.234
If you admit that
you're a 30-year-old man

11:59.236 --> 12:01.236
who's incapable
of functioning on his own.

12:01.238 --> 12:06.074
Ooh, Sock Mouth's
got him on the ropes.

12:06.076 --> 12:07.742
I will admit nothing
of the sort.

12:07.744 --> 12:08.943
And now if you'll excuse me,

12:08.945 --> 12:10.662
I have
to call my dentist and see

12:10.664 --> 12:13.348
if I can also get my hair
shampooed and my nails clipped.

12:25.294 --> 12:27.412
Oh, good, your power's out, too.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.546
Why is that good?

12:28.548 --> 12:30.215
Because last month,

12:30.217 --> 12:32.083
I sent the electric company
a Starbucks gift card,

12:32.085 --> 12:36.104
an apology note, and a few
snapshots of me in a bra.

12:36.906 --> 12:38.390
Power failure.

12:38.392 --> 12:40.591
Implementing
power-failure protocol.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.611
What happened to all your glow-
in-the-dark-emergency-exit stuff

12:43.613 --> 12:45.563
you had painted on the floor?

12:45.565 --> 12:47.899
Oh, that was
wildly carcinogenic.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.434
Anyway...

12:49.436 --> 12:51.236
it's too bad you're
no longer entitled

12:51.238 --> 12:52.987
to the full benefits
of my friendship,

12:52.989 --> 12:56.007
because I happen to be
extremely prepared

12:56.009 --> 12:57.158
for such an emergency.

12:57.160 --> 12:59.744
Please try not to see
anything by this light.

12:59.746 --> 13:01.463
It's not for you.

13:02.948 --> 13:05.667
It's just a blackout; I'm sure
the power will be back on soon.

13:05.669 --> 13:07.502
And I'm sure some fool
in the Donner party

13:07.504 --> 13:09.304
said the snow would
stop any day now.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.708
I like to think
they ate him first.

13:14.677 --> 13:16.511
You know, I got some candles
in my apartment.

13:16.513 --> 13:18.396
But candles?!
During a blackout?!

13:18.398 --> 13:20.131
Are you mad?
That's a fire hazard.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.049
No, Pasadena

13:21.051 --> 13:22.434
Water and Power recommends

13:22.436 --> 13:24.686
the far safer glow stick.

13:24.688 --> 13:26.905
You call that
a glow stick?

13:32.912 --> 13:35.413
<i>That</i> is a glow stick.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.148
Come on, let's go.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.117
Before you go,
consider this.

13:39.119 --> 13:42.587
Not only do I have a deep-cycle
marine battery power source

13:42.589 --> 13:43.755
which is more than capable

13:43.757 --> 13:45.173
of running our
entertainment system,

13:45.175 --> 13:46.574
I also have

13:46.576 --> 13:50.261
all 61 episodes
of the BBC series <i>Red Dwarf...</i>

13:50.263 --> 13:53.598
and Fiddle-Faddle.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.216
All yours

13:55.218 --> 13:57.969
if you're willing to reinstate
the Roommate Agreement.

13:57.971 --> 14:01.990
I've got wine at my place and
some bubble wrap we could pop.

14:06.529 --> 14:07.729
Oh, he'll be back.

14:07.731 --> 14:09.447
Wine and a girl in the dark--

14:09.449 --> 14:11.866
he's gonna be bored
out of his mind.

14:13.068 --> 14:15.403
To wine and bubble wrap.

14:16.973 --> 14:19.958
And to not having to watch
Sheldon demonstrate

14:19.960 --> 14:21.709
his reverse osmosis machine

14:21.711 --> 14:24.212
that converts urine
into drinking water.

14:26.215 --> 14:28.249
You know, in Girl Scouts,
Tammie Dineesha said

14:28.251 --> 14:30.502
you could do that
with panty hose.

14:30.504 --> 14:33.388
Boy, was she wrong.

14:33.390 --> 14:36.508
Anyway, you want
to make out?

14:36.510 --> 14:39.477
I thought because our
relationship's in a beta test,

14:39.479 --> 14:41.813
you wanted to
take things slow.

14:41.815 --> 14:43.114
Okay.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.917
Do you want to make out slow?

14:45.919 --> 14:50.822
I can go so slow it'll be like
there's a snail in your mouth.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.843
Ugh.

14:56.612 --> 14:59.397
Well, lucky for you, there's
nothing else to do right now.

15:01.650 --> 15:03.117
Excuse me, Leonard.

15:03.119 --> 15:04.402
Since when don't you knock?

15:04.404 --> 15:06.621
It's like the only
good thing about you.

15:06.623 --> 15:09.374
Social niceties
have been suspended, Leonard.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.009
We're in a state of a emergency.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.410
The world has

15:12.412 --> 15:14.178
descended into darkened turmoil.

15:14.180 --> 15:17.765
Lawlessness and savagery
are the order of the day.

15:17.767 --> 15:19.450
Fine, what is it?

15:19.452 --> 15:20.869
I'm making s'mores.

15:22.054 --> 15:23.354
I wanted to alert you

15:23.356 --> 15:24.755
in case you smelled
caramelizing marshmallows

15:24.757 --> 15:27.692
and thought a nearby
candy factory was on fire.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.911
S'mores, huh?
Good for you.

15:29.913 --> 15:32.897
Yes, or good for us

15:32.899 --> 15:34.115
if you sign here

15:34.117 --> 15:36.067
and reinstate
the full Roommate Agreement.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.285
No, thanks. I'm good.

15:37.287 --> 15:38.769
Really?

15:38.771 --> 15:40.405
Huh! Okay.

15:40.407 --> 15:43.324
In that case, I will have
a s'more by myself.

15:43.326 --> 15:46.411
And then I'm gonna have s'more.

15:49.999 --> 15:51.949
By myself.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.135
- Aw.
- No, don't "aw" him.

15:54.137 --> 15:55.670
He brought this all
on himself.

15:55.672 --> 15:57.338
But he's sad.

15:57.340 --> 15:58.256
No, he's crazy.

15:58.258 --> 15:59.790
Sometimes crazy
looks like sad

15:59.792 --> 16:02.176
so it'll suck you back in.

16:02.178 --> 16:05.980
I think he misses
his little buddy.

16:07.483 --> 16:09.601
Fine.

16:09.603 --> 16:11.102
But mark my words,

16:11.104 --> 16:14.772
this frustrating, bogus teenage
make-out session is not over.

16:24.116 --> 16:26.651
I thought you said
candles were dangerous.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.770
This is a Bunsen burner.

16:30.272 --> 16:33.458
I'm a scientist;
I know what I'm doing.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.660
Oh, drat.

16:39.965 --> 16:41.332
Aww.

16:41.334 --> 16:45.336
It took me a gallon of urine
to make that water.

16:48.390 --> 16:50.358
Listen, Sheldon, this is stupid.

16:50.360 --> 16:52.026
I don't see why we can't
be friends.

16:52.028 --> 16:53.678
And I'm willing to
drive you around

16:53.680 --> 16:55.012
and help you out with stuff.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.180
I just don't want to do it

16:56.182 --> 16:57.682
because of some
silly Roommate Agreement.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.317
What are you proposing?

16:59.319 --> 17:01.486
That we go back to
the way things were.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.404
But when I do
something for you,

17:03.406 --> 17:05.205
you show a little
appreciation.

17:05.208 --> 17:07.692
And how would I do that?

17:07.694 --> 17:10.377
You say "thank you."

17:10.380 --> 17:13.196
Every time?

17:13.199 --> 17:16.000
It's not crazy.

17:16.002 --> 17:18.386
Counter-proposal.

17:18.387 --> 17:20.538
We reinstate the full
Roommate Agreement

17:20.540 --> 17:22.205
with the following addendum:

17:22.208 --> 17:25.893
in the spirit of Mother's Day
or Father's Day,

17:25.895 --> 17:29.180
once a year, we set aside
a day to celebrate

17:29.182 --> 17:31.382
all your contributions
to my life,

17:31.384 --> 17:34.986
both actual and imagined by you.

17:36.155 --> 17:38.072
We could call it Leonard's Day.

17:38.074 --> 17:41.909
I kind of like
the sound of that.

17:41.911 --> 17:43.060
Of course you do.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.328
It's about you,
like everything else.

17:44.330 --> 17:47.081
Oh, thank goodness.

17:47.083 --> 17:50.568
I don't think I had it in me
to make another glass of water.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.571
So, do I get breakfast
in bed on Leonard's Day?

17:53.573 --> 17:54.622
No.

17:54.624 --> 17:55.707
Can I sit in your spot?

17:55.709 --> 17:56.708
No.

17:56.710 --> 17:58.576
Can I control the thermostat?

17:58.578 --> 17:59.260
No.

17:59.262 --> 18:00.762
Do I get a card?

18:00.764 --> 18:02.580
Of course you get a card.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.416
It's Leonard's Day.

18:06.185 --> 18:07.802
Hey, guys, the building
manager said

18:07.804 --> 18:09.353
the reason
the power went out is

18:09.355 --> 18:10.605
someone went
down into the basement

18:10.607 --> 18:12.540
and just pulled the
main breaker switch.

18:15.277 --> 18:17.361
Really.

18:19.097 --> 18:20.431
Who do you think
did that, Sheldon?

18:20.433 --> 18:25.203
Oh, I don't know.

18:26.321 --> 18:28.956
But whoever
that mystery man was,

18:28.958 --> 18:30.658
you should be
eternally grateful,

18:30.660 --> 18:34.278
for without him, there would
be no Leonard's Day.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.264
Leonard's Day?

18:36.266 --> 18:37.331
Oh, no pressure.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.116
Just get him a crummy card,
you're good.

18:47.357 --> 18:49.758
All right, test my ring tone.

18:54.715 --> 18:57.316
- That really is a good song.
- Oh, yeah.

18:57.318 --> 18:59.101
There's a reason
he's <i>Sir</i> Elton John.

18:59.103 --> 19:00.269
They don't make you a knight

19:00.271 --> 19:02.638
for writing "Wake Me Up
Before You Go Go."

19:04.274 --> 19:06.742
Howard, are you
coming down for breakfast?!

19:06.744 --> 19:08.327
Ma, I told you I have

19:08.329 --> 19:09.862
a video conference with NASA!

19:09.864 --> 19:11.163
I said don't bother me!

19:11.165 --> 19:13.866
Oh! Listen to
Mr. Big Shot Astronaut!

19:13.868 --> 19:18.236
Yes, please listen
to Mr. Big Shot Astronaut!

19:21.925 --> 19:24.409
Hey, good morning.

19:24.411 --> 19:26.895
Hey, Howard,
thanks for getting up so early.

19:26.897 --> 19:29.681
No problem, Dr. Massimino.

19:29.683 --> 19:31.500
The guys here call me Mass.

19:31.502 --> 19:33.385
Mass!
That's a cool nickname.

19:33.387 --> 19:36.188
'Cause force equals mass
times acceleration.

19:36.190 --> 19:37.423
Yeah.

19:37.425 --> 19:40.192
It's just short
for Massimino.

19:41.978 --> 19:45.030
Anyway, the plan for this
morning is to go over the...

19:46.450 --> 19:47.566
Sorry. My phone.

19:47.568 --> 19:50.536
What is that?
Is that "Rocket Man"?

19:50.538 --> 19:52.037
Yeah, my ring tone.

19:52.039 --> 19:54.540
Kind of my favorite song,
"Rocket Man."

19:54.542 --> 19:56.041
Howard,

19:56.043 --> 19:59.895
your Fruit Loops
are getting soggy!

20:00.997 --> 20:02.464
Not now!

20:02.466 --> 20:03.749
Who's that?

20:03.751 --> 20:05.834
My mom. Sorry.

20:05.836 --> 20:09.071
No problem... Fruit Loops.
