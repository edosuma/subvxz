WEBVTT

00:03.337 --> 00:05.339
ARCHER:
Ugh. Oh, God. Ugh.

00:05.506 --> 00:08.680
No, forget the glass, Woodhouse,
just give me the pitcher.

00:08.926 --> 00:11.770
For I am a sinner
in the hands of an angry God.

00:11.929 --> 00:15.229
Bloody Mary, full of vodka,
blessed are you among cocktails.

00:15.390 --> 00:20.612
Pray for me now and at the hour of my death,
which I hope is soon. Amen.

00:21.271 --> 00:24.775
Uh, perhaps a coddled egg?

00:26.109 --> 00:27.827
No. No eggs, Woodhouse.

00:27.986 --> 00:30.535
Maybe ever again.
Some dry toast?

00:30.697 --> 00:33.246
Yeah, or you could skip a step
and feed me some vomit.

00:33.408 --> 00:35.786
Not like you to get a hangover, sir.

00:35.953 --> 00:39.583
I don't know what happened. I mean,
I kind of remember being at the wake.

00:40.999 --> 00:43.127
Oh, you poor dear.

00:43.293 --> 00:48.424
On behalf of his fellow ISIS agents, please
let me be the first to offer my condolences.

00:48.590 --> 00:53.266
And let me be the first
to welcome you back into the dating pool.

00:54.638 --> 00:56.640
And/or my new hot tub.

00:56.807 --> 00:58.730
But after that, it's just snippets.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.940
I think I had one more drink there.

01:01.103 --> 01:02.571
ALL:
Drink, drink, drink!

01:02.729 --> 01:04.822
<i>ARCHER:
Then I think I took a cab.</i>

01:05.232 --> 01:08.657
Hang on, wait! Let me see some hands!

01:09.152 --> 01:11.575
Who wants chicken and waffles?

01:12.114 --> 01:14.208
How did we bring food in here?

01:14.366 --> 01:16.915
Oh. And also, did we lose some people?

01:17.077 --> 01:19.000
Lana and Cyril bailed.

01:19.162 --> 01:20.709
Triﬂing bitches.

01:20.872 --> 01:24.001
Here. Unless you're a triﬂing bitch too.

01:24.167 --> 01:25.714
Oh. Oh!

01:25.877 --> 01:27.800
What did I just put inside me?

01:27.963 --> 01:31.137
Green Russians.
It's absinthe and milk.

01:31.300 --> 01:34.679
Sweet shitsnacks, look at those!

01:34.845 --> 01:37.849
<i>ARCHER:
Oh, my God! That's right!</i>

01:38.098 --> 01:41.022
It's somewhat coming back to me.

01:41.184 --> 01:44.939
Whoo! I'm Pacman Jones!
Come home with me.

01:45.188 --> 01:48.192
Plus, my valet will give you some heroin.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.781
Thankfully, I didn't have to share.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.662
But she did, she came home with me.

01:52.821 --> 01:56.621
I remember. I mean, Green Russians,
it's fuzzy. I don't remember this.

01:56.783 --> 02:00.162
But I do remember her being
the best sex I've ever had in my life.

02:00.329 --> 02:01.376
Uh--
Shut up.

02:01.538 --> 02:04.838
And that includes Europe, Lana,
my Brazilian au pair.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.049
No woman has ever made me-- Oh, shit!

02:08.377 --> 02:10.050
Sir?
Phone number! Matchbook!

02:10.213 --> 02:13.763
I don't know her name, where she works.
Woodhouse, how am I gonna find her?

02:13.925 --> 02:16.895
Um, mm. You might check the loo.

02:17.054 --> 02:19.523
What, here? Why didn't you say so?
Ow.

02:20.015 --> 02:21.642
Ow!

02:21.808 --> 02:24.732
Ow, ow, ow.

02:25.604 --> 02:28.278
Uh, so... Hey, hi.

02:28.440 --> 02:32.911
I'm, uh, Sterling Archer.
You may remember me from the strip club...

02:33.070 --> 02:36.540
...and hopefully also from what was
hands down the most incredible sex...

02:36.698 --> 02:38.575
...that I personally have ever had.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.540
Uh, hello?

02:40.702 --> 02:46.505
Oh, right, so, uh, I know, uh, we had an
implied oral agreement about heroin, but--

02:46.667 --> 02:50.888
Heroin! That's the last fricking thing I need.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.428
I'm bound up tighter than dick's hatband.

02:54.591 --> 02:57.595
No, no, no, not-- Wait, were you...?

02:57.761 --> 03:01.391
Did-- Did we?
Yeah, we did. And you loved it!

03:01.682 --> 03:04.060
No, I'm sorry, I can't...

03:08.000 --> 03:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:41.972 --> 03:43.724
Okay, jeez, I get it!

03:43.890 --> 03:47.394
Well, you say that, but I worry that
you think I'm exaggerating when I say--

03:47.561 --> 03:51.065
That I was the best sex you ever had?
No.

03:51.648 --> 03:54.993
That if anybody ever finds out about it,
I will literally--

03:55.152 --> 03:57.871
Pam, look at me. I will literally murder you.

03:58.029 --> 04:00.407
Not literally.
Yes, literally.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.418
You will wake up
in three separate 50-gallon drums.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.875
That's 150 gallons...

04:06.037 --> 04:10.008
...of Pam's hot, dirty, ball-slappiney--

04:10.167 --> 04:12.966
Oh, God!
Come at me, bro!

04:14.713 --> 04:17.683
<i> How you gonna keep 'em
Down on the farm</i>

04:17.841 --> 04:20.640
<i>After they seen Pam-ee?</i>

04:20.802 --> 04:22.019
Yeah, how are you gonna--

04:22.179 --> 04:26.355
I mean, my God, you can't.
That was just--

04:26.516 --> 04:27.642
MALORY:
Disgusting!

04:27.809 --> 04:29.937
And I hoped I would never have to say this...

04:30.103 --> 04:32.902
...but you finally topped
your 10th grade sports banquet.

04:33.064 --> 04:37.114
L-- Okay, first of all,
Mrs. Coach Mumford came on to me.

04:37.319 --> 04:39.663
And second of all...
What are we talking about?

04:39.821 --> 04:42.074
Hitting on your dead colleague's widow...

04:42.240 --> 04:44.663
...at his own wake!
Oh, that.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.170
Okay, so--
So help me God, Sterling...

04:47.329 --> 04:50.503
...sometimes I think that
I've failed as a mother.

04:50.749 --> 04:52.342
Sometimes?
Oh, shut up.

04:52.501 --> 04:54.879
And the last thing you need
is another drink.

04:55.045 --> 04:58.345
Ugh. Seriously, how can you be drinking
after last night?

04:58.507 --> 05:00.805
How can you not?
Because I don't have a problem.

05:02.177 --> 05:03.474
Well, I do.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.731
First step's admitting it, Mother.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.812
Not with drinking!
BOTH: Uh...

05:08.225 --> 05:13.573
My problem, besides your snide remarks,
is Nikolai Jakov, head of the KGB.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.528
And also possibly Archer's father.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.317
What?
How do you know about that?

05:17.484 --> 05:20.909
Because I'm part of everybody.
Damn that blabbermouthing Pam!

05:21.071 --> 05:22.823
Why, what did she say?

05:22.989 --> 05:26.835
Besides the stuff about Jakov,
which obviously is what you meant, so--

05:26.993 --> 05:30.338
So Nikolai has been dropping hints
that he may want to defect.

05:30.497 --> 05:31.714
What?
That's awesome.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.420
I think you mean "awful."

05:33.583 --> 05:37.713
Uh, ISIS getting an inside look
at every single KGB operation in the world?

05:37.879 --> 05:38.926
And that's awful how?

05:39.089 --> 05:41.763
Because he thinks
he's going to move in with me!

05:41.925 --> 05:47.022
Me, who happens to be in a relationship
with Burt Reynolds, in case you've forgotten?

05:47.180 --> 05:50.309
I actually did forget that.
Yeah, I never see you together.

05:50.475 --> 05:52.398
Are you like dating, or...?
It's...

05:52.561 --> 05:53.608
...complicated.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.239
What with our work schedules and...

05:56.398 --> 05:59.743
...work, it's hard to find time
for actual dates.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.949
But you do see one another?

06:02.112 --> 06:04.786
Well, yes, of course, but--
But never in public, right?

06:04.948 --> 06:07.701
Only at your place, or maybe a hotel, or--

06:07.868 --> 06:10.166
Or on the dirty floor in the elevator?

06:10.328 --> 06:11.796
What? Pam!

06:11.955 --> 06:16.381
Get your bloated carcass--
Out! I got it, I'm on this, I got it!

06:16.543 --> 06:18.420
How did she know about the elevator?

06:18.587 --> 06:22.308
L... Ew.
Burt made sure I erased the security tape.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.679
You don't think Burt's ashamed
to be seen with me?

06:27.888 --> 06:29.435
Lana?
I'm sorry?

06:29.598 --> 06:33.023
Well, I'm sorry, but if anybody ever found out,
I would die of shame.

06:33.184 --> 06:35.858
Well, how do you think that makes me feel?

06:36.021 --> 06:37.898
I don't care, Pam.

06:38.064 --> 06:42.160
Having said that, would you please come
in this dirty toilet stall and have sex with me?

06:42.402 --> 06:44.825
Oh, all right.

06:45.030 --> 06:48.830
But this time, get in there.
All you've been doing is giving one side hell.

06:49.034 --> 06:51.708
Well, when you put it like that,
it sounds kind of shitty.

06:51.870 --> 06:55.670
Thirty years of my life I give to the KGB...

06:55.832 --> 06:59.462
...and now you,
this traitorous cyborg...

06:59.628 --> 07:01.301
...are sitting at my desk?

07:01.463 --> 07:02.840
How would you put it?
Heh, heh.

07:03.006 --> 07:05.384
Yeah, you really got cornholed, huh?

07:05.592 --> 07:09.187
Wait, don't answer yet,
because I'm also reassigning you to Siberia.

07:09.346 --> 07:10.518
Siberia?

07:10.680 --> 07:13.433
Well, Barry can't have you
moping around here, you know...

07:13.600 --> 07:14.943
...sowing the discontent.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.478
Is bad for morale.

07:16.645 --> 07:18.147
<i>Et tu, Brute?</i>

07:18.313 --> 07:19.735
<i>Et</i> me, buddy.
Ah!

07:19.898 --> 07:22.492
So here's my advice to you:
dress in layers.

07:22.651 --> 07:26.872
And don't even think about
doing anything crazy like defeating.

07:27.197 --> 07:30.167
I would never defect! I love mother Russia!

07:30.325 --> 07:33.704
Even when you're chopping through the ice
in the toilet so you can poop?

07:33.870 --> 07:35.213
I'm kidding, obviously.

07:35.372 --> 07:38.376
I mean, you're gonna be like
600 miles from a toilet.

07:38.708 --> 07:41.837
Sorry, had to go to the bathroom.
Nothing unusual, just, uh, you know...

07:42.003 --> 07:44.506
...normal bodily waste excretion.

07:44.673 --> 07:47.222
If you're quite finished...
Damn near.

07:47.384 --> 07:50.558
Then go home, sober up,
and make sure your apartment is secure.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.064
Um, why? To all three of those.

07:53.223 --> 07:57.353
Because if and when Nikolai shows up here,
he's not staying at my place.

07:57.519 --> 07:58.987
Well, he's not staying with me.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.738
Then go prep the safe house.

08:00.897 --> 08:04.697
Because you can bet every KGB agent
and freelance assassin...

08:04.859 --> 08:08.238
...this side of Berlin
will be hunting him down like a dog.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.202
Who hunts dogs?

08:10.365 --> 08:12.993
CHERYL:
Orientals! Duh.

08:15.870 --> 08:20.421
So when you say you assume Jakov
got on that train to Siberia...

08:20.583 --> 08:22.756
...you know what you're doing?
I make you ass.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.796
And Barry doesn't like!

08:26.006 --> 08:28.600
Being made an ass, he really doesn't.

08:28.758 --> 08:31.432
And <i>as</i> you can--
Well, it's over there now...

08:31.594 --> 08:35.097
...but the telex from the Siberia desk
says Jakov never showed up.

08:35.265 --> 08:38.690
Now, why do you think that might be?
Um...

08:38.852 --> 08:40.274
Thank you, Boris.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.610
I won't forget this!

08:43.063 --> 08:45.817
I promised myself I don't cry.

08:46.109 --> 08:47.326
Promise broken.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.950
Hey, what was that?

08:50.238 --> 08:53.583
Allergies.
To what, making sure people get on trains?

08:55.160 --> 08:57.288
Aw, nice one, other Barry.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.877
Now Jakov's got a 12-hour head start...

09:00.040 --> 09:05.137
...and the details of every single KGB operation
on the globe in his fat, combed-over head.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.969
Ah. And you have no idea where he went.

09:08.131 --> 09:11.852
Well, I assume he's in New York
with those shit-bitching-ass-bastard Archers.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.432
But--
I can assume!

09:13.595 --> 09:15.347
You're already an ass.

09:15.513 --> 09:19.484
Contact our sleeper in New York
and then cancel all my meetings this week...

09:19.642 --> 09:21.895
...because I will also be in New York.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.655
Murdering people.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.362
Uh, don't take this the wrong way...

09:26.524 --> 09:29.323
...but I pictured you having nicer apartment.

09:29.486 --> 09:32.615
MALORY: Ha-ha-ha!
Why that is funny?

09:32.781 --> 09:36.502
Hmm? Oh, no, sorry.
There's a funny "Marmaduke" on the fridge.

09:36.743 --> 09:41.089
A what?
This is actually, ahem, the ISIS safe house.

09:41.247 --> 09:42.999
Cheers!
Safe house?

09:43.166 --> 09:46.511
But Malory, I assumed--
Which you shouldn't have.

09:46.711 --> 09:50.386
What, you thought you'd just show up
out of the blue and we'd move in together?

09:50.590 --> 09:52.012
Pretty much, yeah.

09:53.468 --> 09:55.345
Nikolai, it's not that I don't--

09:55.553 --> 09:59.649
Am not very fond of you.
I mean, we have such history together, and--

09:59.808 --> 10:01.560
And maybe a son.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.228
<i>Mm...</i>

10:03.394 --> 10:07.149
Maybe. But--
But, so, where is he?

10:07.315 --> 10:08.532
LANA:
Good question.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.864
He was supposed to prep this dump.
And didn't.

10:11.027 --> 10:13.246
And now he's supposed to be here
for guard duty.

10:13.404 --> 10:14.826
And isn't.
Uh...

10:14.989 --> 10:17.868
Hi. Lana Kane. You must be Major Jakov,
such a pleasure.

10:18.034 --> 10:20.628
Be a lamb and take those to the kitchen.

10:20.787 --> 10:23.085
So I think I speak for all of us when I say...

10:23.248 --> 10:26.297
...we shouldn't be the only ones guarding
your maybe-baby-daddy.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.427
I can't believe you all know about that.

10:28.586 --> 10:31.965
JAKOV:
Wow, ha, ha, that is big dog!

10:32.132 --> 10:34.726
Marmaduke.
And regardless of any personal ties...

10:34.884 --> 10:38.980
...I may have with Nikolai, he's an invaluable
asset and we have to protect him.

10:39.139 --> 10:42.393
I mean, you know,
at least until he's been debriefed.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.561
And then? What, he's on his own?

10:45.103 --> 10:47.572
Ahem.
Wow.

10:47.897 --> 10:50.741
I'm serious,
you are literally draining the life out of me.

10:50.900 --> 10:55.371
Come on, you make me sound like
some kind of chupacabra, but for dicks.

10:55.530 --> 11:00.252
Heh. A terrifying yet accurate comparison.
Where'd you learn all that stuff?

11:00.410 --> 11:02.959
You know I grew up on a farm, right?

11:03.204 --> 11:05.457
Really hoping that's not relevant.

11:05.623 --> 11:08.422
Ms. Kane and your mother.
Hooray.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.883
Okay, I gotta bounce. Later, taters!

11:11.254 --> 11:13.803
Lana, listen, if this is a booty call,
I'm flattered, but--

11:13.965 --> 11:15.091
LANA:
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

11:15.258 --> 11:16.885
<i>MALORY:
You're supposed to be guarding Nikolai!</i>

11:17.051 --> 11:20.931
Yeah, so, uh, about that, I mean,
don't you think that's gonna be kind of...

11:22.682 --> 11:25.982
...um, awkward?
I actually think it's kind of sweet.

11:26.144 --> 11:27.771
ARCHER: Uh, little help?
No, you're good.

11:27.937 --> 11:31.817
The camera's set up for debriefing
and one of us will relieve you in eight hours.

11:31.983 --> 11:33.485
Wait, where are you guys going?

11:33.651 --> 11:34.868
Uh, a town called work.

11:35.028 --> 11:38.623
Neutralizing a KGB sleeper in Brooklyn,
thanks to this intel from the major.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.951
It was least I could do.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.664
Since otherwise he'd kill you?

11:42.869 --> 11:45.918
Is win-win.
Is it?

11:48.833 --> 11:51.427
<i>80...</i>
Yeah?

11:51.628 --> 11:53.972
Sterling.
Yeah?

11:54.130 --> 11:55.598
Is long time.

11:55.757 --> 11:57.384
Yeah, when was, uh...?

11:57.550 --> 12:00.554
Oh, I guess when I was
in the dreaded Lubyanka...

12:00.720 --> 12:03.690
...with jumper cables clamped to my balls!

12:04.349 --> 12:08.946
So, da, this is a little awkward.

12:09.103 --> 12:10.195
Yeah.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.528
Maybe some shots?
Yeah, let's try that.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.152
LANA:
Any time now.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.370
Cyril. Cyril!

12:20.156 --> 12:22.909
Lana, I, uh--
I don't think I'm cut out for this.

12:23.076 --> 12:26.330
Well, don't take this the wrong way,
but neither does anyone else.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.123
Just pretend he's like a rabid dog.

12:28.289 --> 12:30.166
Oh, God, just like Old Yeller.

12:30.333 --> 12:33.212
Yeah, if Old Yeller had a big stack
of KGB codebooks...

12:33.378 --> 12:36.348
...and fif--
Forty thousand bucks in a floor safe.

12:36.506 --> 12:40.010
And was also identified as a sleeper agent
by the head of the KGB.

12:40.176 --> 12:41.519
Who, Barry?
LANA: What?

12:41.678 --> 12:43.521
White? You guys like smooth R&B?

12:43.680 --> 12:45.774
Duh.
Are you telling me Barry...

12:45.932 --> 12:50.153
..."The Bionic Douche Bag" Dillon
is running the KGB?

12:50.311 --> 12:51.608
Only if I can defect too.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.365
Because that dude is out of his damn mind.

12:54.524 --> 12:57.027
I'm listening.
He's crazy!

12:57.193 --> 12:59.537
I mean, he's smart,
way smarter than Jakov, but--

12:59.696 --> 13:02.495
Oh, and you can bet Jakov's intel is bad.

13:02.657 --> 13:04.500
Really? This isn't your kneecap?

13:04.659 --> 13:05.706
Don't you get it?

13:05.868 --> 13:08.621
Barry gave me up
so you'd trust Jakov on the rest.

13:08.788 --> 13:13.043
He knew Jakov wanted to defect, so--
So he's been feeding him fake intel?

13:13.209 --> 13:14.256
I mean, I assume.

13:14.419 --> 13:16.137
Because Barry's got a master plan...

13:16.296 --> 13:19.641
...which when you hear it,
will probably make your head explo--

13:19.799 --> 13:21.221
LANA: Jesus!
GILLETTE: Jesus!

13:21.384 --> 13:24.228
LANA: Ahem, Cyril?
I'm sorry.

13:24.387 --> 13:26.560
Yes. Yes, you are.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.692
JAKOV:
ls I who am sorry.

13:29.851 --> 13:32.195
I should have been there for you.

13:32.353 --> 13:37.735
Shut up, don't do that. I mean,
what were you gonna do, marry my mother?

13:37.900 --> 13:39.243
Have you met her? Ow!

13:39.402 --> 13:43.032
Don't you ever disrespect her.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.245
You're not my dad!

13:49.078 --> 13:53.208
How would you know?
I know, right?

13:53.374 --> 13:57.254
But I have to say, you don't look like me.

13:57.420 --> 14:00.640
And don't take this the wrong way,
but thank Christ!

14:00.798 --> 14:02.266
Ha, ha-- Ow!

14:02.425 --> 14:04.052
Watch it, you dumb idiot!

14:04.218 --> 14:05.595
Oh, man, I'm so sorry.

14:05.762 --> 14:08.561
Here, let me get you-- Oh, my God, Cheryl!

14:08.723 --> 14:12.318
Barry?
Wow, I was hoping I'd bump into you.

14:12.477 --> 14:15.777
Wait, really?
And darn if I didn't, literally.

14:15.938 --> 14:19.112
You-- Wait a minute,
why am I thinking you live in, like, Russia?

14:19.275 --> 14:21.118
Maybe the tracksuit?

14:21.277 --> 14:24.076
Duh. Right. Which by the way,
you are totally rocking.

14:24.322 --> 14:26.290
Oh, that's just my huge muscles.

14:26.449 --> 14:28.417
Oh, ha, ha.

14:28.576 --> 14:31.420
So tell me, how strong are you?

14:31.579 --> 14:33.581
Insanely. Wanna get out of here?

14:33.748 --> 14:37.798
Oh, my God, totally, but it has to be your place
because mine reeks of ocelot piss.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.839
I have no response to that.
Doesn't merit one.

14:41.005 --> 14:44.976
And my place is currently flooding, so...
Hotel.

14:45.134 --> 14:48.183
Damn, no money. Tracksuit, no pockets.

14:48.346 --> 14:51.316
Damn it!
I know, it's the one single drawback.

14:51.474 --> 14:54.273
Wait, doesn't ISIS have a safe house?

14:54.435 --> 14:57.314
Yeah, but you have to promise
that all that horrific stuff...

14:57.480 --> 15:00.154
...I think I remember about you
is just false memories.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.193
Because I get those a lot.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.909
Cross the microchip in my heart.

15:05.071 --> 15:08.450
And don't get all girly on me. Check!

15:11.119 --> 15:13.292
MALORY:
Hold the door! Hold the door!

15:13.621 --> 15:14.793
Heading out?

15:14.997 --> 15:18.297
No, I thought I'd just take all my things
for a ride on the elevator.

15:18.459 --> 15:21.008
Okay.
I actually have a date.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.422
With Burt Reynolds. We're watching Gator.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.467
PAM:
Your place?

15:25.633 --> 15:28.261
Well, if we go out, you know,
he's just mobbed, so...

15:28.428 --> 15:32.399
So it's a DVD, a box of wine,
some Hot Pockets, and off to bed.

15:32.557 --> 15:35.436
No! Well, it's not a box of wine.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.855
Pam, let me ask you something.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.615
How can you just leave me here?

15:41.774 --> 15:45.153
<i>ARCHER : Mainly because
I have an incredibly addictive personality.</i>

15:45.319 --> 15:48.323
So just debrief yourself with the camera,
and when I get back...

15:48.489 --> 15:52.414
...we'll talk about the DNA test thing
if, you know, you're still into doing that.

15:52.577 --> 15:55.046
<i>Of course I am still into that.</i>

15:55.538 --> 15:58.508
But in meantime, you think I will be safe?

15:58.666 --> 16:00.384
<i>God, what's Russian for "duh"?</i>

16:00.543 --> 16:03.171
<i>It's a safe house.
Nobody knows where it is.</i>

16:03.337 --> 16:05.556
CHERYL: Well, here it is.
BARRY: Neat.

16:06.007 --> 16:10.057
Can I see your neck a minute?
Oh, Barry.

16:11.095 --> 16:13.439
Barry? Barry. Barry.

16:14.891 --> 16:17.235
Barry!

16:18.227 --> 16:21.231
My point is, if you're confident
in yourself as a woman...

16:21.397 --> 16:23.616
...who cares if he wants
to keep it on the D.L.?

16:23.774 --> 16:26.653
Well, yes, but--
But nothing!

16:26.819 --> 16:29.242
Because who's to say
you're not using him for sex?

16:29.405 --> 16:31.954
Pam, don't take this the wrong way...

16:32.116 --> 16:35.416
...but you're not nearly as stupid as you look.
Okay.

16:37.580 --> 16:40.584
Archer, don't talk, just listen.
ARCHER: Why, what's up? <i>What</i> do--

16:40.750 --> 16:44.971
Jakov's intel is bad and Barry's got some sort
of master plan that we're clueless about...

16:45.129 --> 16:47.803
...thanks to Cyril.
Who has apologized profusely--

16:47.965 --> 16:50.434
Quiet game!
We're gonna regroup at the safe house...

16:50.593 --> 16:52.766
...and try to figure out...

16:52.929 --> 16:54.146
Goddamn it.
What?

16:54.305 --> 16:56.103
Wait for it.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.189
<i>ARCHER:
Leave it!</i>

17:02.813 --> 17:05.406
Da, da, keep your shirt on.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.443
Barry doesn't wear a shirt.

17:08.861 --> 17:12.035
Ruins Barry's whole tracksuit vibe.

17:12.406 --> 17:15.329
I swear to God,
if he put as much effort into his job...

17:15.492 --> 17:18.087
...as he does into those idiot voicemails...

17:18.246 --> 17:20.795
And you say you got this from a KGB sleeper?

17:20.957 --> 17:23.585
LANA: <i>Right before Cyril blew his head off.</i>
What?

17:24.042 --> 17:28.924
You son of bitch,
you actually think you'll get away with this?

17:30.466 --> 17:33.345
Obviously. Why else would I do it?

17:33.511 --> 17:36.139
Who knows with you? You're crazy.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.477
Am I?!

17:37.640 --> 17:41.110
Ha, ha.
I mean, between Archer ruining my life...

17:41.269 --> 17:45.024
...and you dicks turning me into a cyborg,
I'm kind of amazed I'm even this sane.

17:45.189 --> 17:48.659
Which is obviously a relative term, but--
Uh, what are you doing?

17:48.818 --> 17:50.035
Rationalizing my behavior.

17:50.194 --> 17:51.787
With gas.
Oh.

17:51.946 --> 17:54.165
Oh, killing you.
Oh.

17:54.323 --> 17:56.826
Ha, ha. Oh, Marmaduke.

17:56.993 --> 18:00.213
Ah. And gas is not so bad way to die.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.082
Well, again, relative term.

18:02.248 --> 18:07.971
And afterward, if Sterling want,
he can still get some DNA from my body...

18:08.129 --> 18:10.507
...and find out if I am his real father.

18:10.673 --> 18:14.177
Which I'm sure would provide him
with some much-needed closure...

18:14.385 --> 18:16.353
...which is why it's not gonna happen.

18:16.512 --> 18:18.480
Uh, why, what is that?

18:18.639 --> 18:22.394
This, glad you asked,
is a block of ice with a fork frozen in it.

18:22.560 --> 18:23.857
What are you doing with it?

18:24.020 --> 18:28.867
I am putting this fork-filled block of ice
in this microwave oven.

18:29.025 --> 18:33.872
Now I'm setting the timer for five--
Oh, heck, let's call it 10 minutes.

18:34.030 --> 18:36.249
Doesn't matter, ice can't tell time.

18:36.407 --> 18:39.581
It can only melt.
And when it does--

18:39.744 --> 18:44.215
Spark from fork, gas from stove--
Boom.

18:44.373 --> 18:47.752
And no DNA left for papa test.
Nope.

18:47.918 --> 18:49.716
Just uncertainty and doubt.

18:49.879 --> 18:53.224
Which hopefully, over time,
will eventually drive Archer insane.

18:53.382 --> 18:57.853
And this, this is your master plan?
Huh? Heh.

18:58.012 --> 19:00.390
Oh, no, no. No, this is a whole other
awesome thing.

19:00.556 --> 19:03.309
This is just a goof. Later, tater.

19:05.061 --> 19:10.568
Sterling, if by some miracle,
this video tape survives the explosion...

19:10.733 --> 19:13.828
...there is something very important
I want you to know.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.573
First thing is, your shitter's clogged.

19:16.739 --> 19:18.366
Don't care, can't feel my legs.

19:18.532 --> 19:22.753
Second thing is, if you want me
to keep doing you dirty on the down-low--

19:22.912 --> 19:25.085
Yes, yes, yes.

19:25.247 --> 19:28.217
Then we are gonna have some ground rules.
To wit!

19:28.417 --> 19:30.090
Barry? Was here?

19:30.252 --> 19:33.882
Yeah, but she says he took off after he--
Here, you tell her.

19:34.048 --> 19:38.599
So Barry brought me here--
How did he know where "here" was?

19:39.970 --> 19:43.691
No idea, but then he strangled me,
which at first was hot.

19:43.849 --> 19:48.605
He is, like, super strong, but then I was,
like, floating toward this really bright light...

19:48.771 --> 19:51.240
...and some guy with a beard.
Jesus Christ!

19:51.399 --> 19:54.403
Or Richie Havens.
Nikolai!

19:54.610 --> 19:56.863
JAKOV:
And so, Sterling...

19:57.154 --> 20:02.786
...remember, things are not always
what they appear.

20:06.539 --> 20:09.167
Hello? Hello?

20:09.333 --> 20:11.631
Oh, for-- Mother, this isn't voice-mail.

20:12.586 --> 20:14.304
<i>
Mother, come on.</i>

20:14.463 --> 20:18.809
<i>The time is exactly 7:16,
and I wish they were...</i>

20:18.968 --> 20:22.268
<i>...but even my voice-mail pranks
aren't that elaborate.</i>

20:22.930 --> 20:24.182
Mother!
Sterling?

20:24.348 --> 20:25.725
<i>Leave it. Just kidding.</i>

20:25.891 --> 20:27.484
Sterling, it's me.

20:27.643 --> 20:30.317
Duh. Where are you? What's all that...?

20:30.479 --> 20:33.528
Uh-huh.

20:33.691 --> 20:36.444
Okay. Yeah.

20:37.027 --> 20:40.281
What's up?
That was, uh... My, uh...

20:40.448 --> 20:44.703
The man who might've been my father...

20:44.869 --> 20:46.837
...just died.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.455
Awkward.

20:48.622 --> 20:54.174
And it's all my fault because
instead of doing my job, I was here...

20:55.171 --> 20:57.594
...half-drunk and having amazing sex.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.180
Well, I wouldn't say amazing.

21:00.342 --> 21:04.017
What? Come on, you were pushing rope!
