WEBVTT

00:04.625 --> 00:05.716
Close your eyes.

00:05.716 --> 00:06.887
Okay.

00:08.759 --> 00:09.930
Open them.

00:09.930 --> 00:10.931
Oh!

00:12.633 --> 00:15.266
Do not hold a cat
in the face of someone

00:15.266 --> 00:16.517
who startles easily.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.519
What is wrong
with you?

00:18.519 --> 00:20.101
Well, you shouldn't have
closed your eyes.

00:20.101 --> 00:22.403
You told me to.
It's an expression.

00:22.403 --> 00:24.105
"You can't win 'em all"
is an expression.

00:24.105 --> 00:26.067
"Close your eyes"
is a command.

00:26.067 --> 00:28.859
Well, you can't
win 'em all.

00:28.859 --> 00:31.742
And please tell me
you did not get a cat.

00:31.742 --> 00:34.075
Ellen, you know
you're not an animal person.

00:34.075 --> 00:37.328
No, I'm not a dog,
bird, turtle, lizard,

00:37.328 --> 00:40.751
snake, gerbil, hamster,
ferret, goat, sheep,

00:40.751 --> 00:44.375
cow, chicken, rabbit,
rooster, pigeon, horse,

00:44.375 --> 00:46.046
Clydesdale horse,
miniature horse,

00:46.046 --> 00:48.719
sea horse, donkey, mule,
or kangaroo person.

00:50.341 --> 00:51.802
But I am a cat person.

00:51.802 --> 00:52.763
Well, that's true.

00:52.763 --> 00:54.095
Cats are the one animal

00:54.095 --> 00:55.936
you have not engaged
in combat with.

00:55.936 --> 00:58.099
Wait a minute,
kangaroo?

00:58.099 --> 01:02.643
Incident at the zoo.
He threw the first punch.

01:02.643 --> 01:04.355
Anyway this cat is only here
for a couple of days.

01:04.355 --> 01:05.856
I'm cat-sitting
for a friend.

01:05.856 --> 01:07.988
She is cute.

01:07.988 --> 01:09.450
Let's call her Marjorie.

01:09.450 --> 01:11.902
She already has a name.
Whiskers.

01:11.902 --> 01:13.244
And Marjorie?
Really?

01:13.244 --> 01:14.695
You want to name the cat
after my mother?

01:14.695 --> 01:16.197
I don't know.

01:16.197 --> 01:17.788
I saw the claws
and the arrogant detachment,

01:17.788 --> 01:18.999
and I thought of her.

01:21.462 --> 01:23.704
What is that cat
doing here?

01:23.704 --> 01:27.468
Stan will freak out
if he sees a cat in the house.

01:27.468 --> 01:28.759
Are you not
thinking straight?

01:28.759 --> 01:31.762
Did that kangaroo
beat you senseless?

01:31.762 --> 01:34.175
Avery, that whole thing
about dogs hating cats

01:34.175 --> 01:36.177
is just a common
misconception.

01:36.177 --> 01:37.678
Like that a kangaroo

01:37.678 --> 01:40.020
will let you put anything
in its pouch.

01:40.020 --> 01:41.562
So you've forgotten

01:41.562 --> 01:43.274
what Stan did that time
a cat got in the house?

01:43.274 --> 01:47.278
( barking )
(screeching )

01:47.278 --> 01:48.859
Still think
it was a good idea

01:48.859 --> 01:50.441
to feed
the neighborhood stray?

01:50.441 --> 01:51.782
No,

01:51.782 --> 01:54.615
it was a bit of
a cat-astrophe.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.577
Good one, Ellen.

01:56.577 --> 01:59.330
More like a cat-aclysm.

01:59.330 --> 02:01.452
Oh, good one,
Bennett.

02:01.452 --> 02:04.084
Don't you ever
do that again.

02:05.506 --> 02:07.087
We have to keep this
a secret from Stan!

02:07.087 --> 02:08.419
I hope
we're not too late.

02:08.419 --> 02:12.253
Something's not right.

02:12.253 --> 02:14.845
Rotting fish,
smelly cheese,

02:14.845 --> 02:16.427
garlic pickle...

02:16.427 --> 02:17.808
we need something stronger
to put him off the scent.

02:17.808 --> 02:19.220
Something really rancid.

02:19.220 --> 02:20.721
Oh, Bennett!
Your stinky foot!

02:20.721 --> 02:21.812
Good idea!

02:22.813 --> 02:24.104
No, the other one!

02:24.104 --> 02:25.436
Oh, of course!

02:25.436 --> 02:26.527
The left one
smells worse.

02:26.527 --> 02:27.648
We don't know why.

02:27.648 --> 02:30.651
Maybe
it's the hali-toe-sis.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.733
Good one, Ben--
Never mind.

02:33.694 --> 02:35.696
TOGETHER: Oh!

02:35.696 --> 02:37.488
I just hope
this works.

02:37.488 --> 02:39.079
( sniffs )

02:39.079 --> 02:40.911
Nope. False alarm.
Just Bennett's foot.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.082
( sniffs again)

02:42.082 --> 02:44.044
Ah, the left one.

03:02.062 --> 03:04.725
Dogs in swimwear.
Kinda disturbing.

03:06.897 --> 03:08.018
What's kinda disturbing

03:08.018 --> 03:09.900
is that
I have that suit.

03:11.732 --> 03:13.694
Is that Rusty?

03:13.694 --> 03:16.156
You think
you know a dog.

03:17.528 --> 03:19.280
What kind of weirdos
go on these sites?

03:19.280 --> 03:20.821
You do, weirdo.

03:20.821 --> 03:22.783
That's because
you sent it to me, weirdo.

03:22.783 --> 03:24.495
That's because I knew
you were a weirdo.

03:24.495 --> 03:26.126
Weirdo.
You're weirder.

03:26.126 --> 03:27.998
Hey,

03:27.998 --> 03:29.880
just returning your key
from the other day

03:29.880 --> 03:30.961
when I walked Stan
for you.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.793
Oh, hey, Nikki,
thanks.

03:32.793 --> 03:34.134
( gasps )

03:34.134 --> 03:36.717
What are we laughing at?

03:36.717 --> 03:38.759
Oh,

03:38.759 --> 03:41.302
dogs wearing swimwear,
that is so funny.

03:43.434 --> 03:45.145
Oh, I'm so sorry.

03:45.145 --> 03:47.348
I didn't mean to do that.
You were just crowding me.

03:47.348 --> 03:50.611
This is really more
of a two person bench.

03:50.611 --> 03:52.443
Oh, I landed
on my phone.

03:52.443 --> 03:53.984
( phone ringing )

03:53.984 --> 03:55.566
Sweet.
You butt-dialed me.

03:55.566 --> 03:57.197
Hey, what's up?

03:57.197 --> 03:59.700
Hey, just sittin' on the floor.
Kinda diggin' it.

03:59.700 --> 04:02.993
Thinking about standing up.
Haven't quite decided.

04:02.993 --> 04:05.245
Oh, hold on,
I'm getting another call.

04:06.497 --> 04:07.578
Hey, Nikki, what's up?

04:07.578 --> 04:09.830
Hi, Tyler.

04:09.830 --> 04:11.832
I'm going to have
some of your smoothie.

04:11.832 --> 04:14.084
I bet we have
the same favorite flavor.

04:14.084 --> 04:15.426
You like
strawberry-banana?

04:15.426 --> 04:16.427
( gags )

04:16.427 --> 04:18.639
Mm-hmm.

04:18.639 --> 04:21.592
The seedy strawberries
and slimy bananas

04:21.592 --> 04:25.766
make it so delicious.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.057
Oh, look,
here's my favorite part

04:27.057 --> 04:28.849
where it comes back
in my mouth

04:28.849 --> 04:30.441
like a little encore.

04:30.441 --> 04:32.313
One time
when I was eating spaghetti,

04:32.313 --> 04:33.604
I burped up
a whole noodle.

04:33.604 --> 04:35.776
True story.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.399
Nikki, I need to talk to you
in the kitchen

04:38.399 --> 04:40.701
about something
really embarrassing.

04:40.701 --> 04:43.704
Oh, is this about your
one pointy ear?

04:43.704 --> 04:46.367
It's so cute.
It's like you're half an elf.

04:46.367 --> 04:48.248
No, it's not about that.

04:48.248 --> 04:50.080
And why does no one focus
on the round ear?

04:51.792 --> 04:53.173
What were you
doing in there?

04:53.173 --> 04:54.875
You were acting
like a fool.
I know.

04:54.875 --> 04:56.967
And drinking a
strawberry-banana smoothie.
I know!

04:56.967 --> 04:58.759
You hate strawberries
and bananas.
I know!

04:58.759 --> 05:00.801
Why are you doing this?
I don't know!

05:02.633 --> 05:04.475
I think I like Tyler.

05:04.475 --> 05:06.727
But Tyler's been
chasing after you forever

05:06.727 --> 05:08.058
and you were
never interested.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.811
Which is the thing
I liked best about you.

05:10.811 --> 05:11.732
What happened?

05:11.732 --> 05:12.933
I think it's--

05:12.933 --> 05:14.485
now that he's with Emily

05:14.485 --> 05:16.316
and he's not trying
so hard with me,

05:16.316 --> 05:18.359
I see how great he is.

05:18.359 --> 05:20.491
But he's not great.
Trust me.

05:20.491 --> 05:21.702
You were right
the first time.

05:23.704 --> 05:26.707
Chloe, we have to keep
that cat hidden from Stan.

05:26.707 --> 05:28.038
You know
how he hates cats.

05:28.038 --> 05:29.660
It's okay.

05:29.660 --> 05:31.161
He'll like this one
once I teach it to talk.

05:31.161 --> 05:33.754
Say, "There's the sugar."

05:33.754 --> 05:35.716
Come on, cat,
you can do it.

05:35.716 --> 05:38.298
"There's the sugar!"

05:38.298 --> 05:42.052
Chloe, we know
animals don't talk.

05:42.052 --> 05:44.675
I think it's cute
that she thinks animals talk.

05:44.675 --> 05:46.767
Thanks, Nikki.

05:46.767 --> 05:49.179
I think it's cute that
you think animals don't talk.

05:52.062 --> 05:54.184
So, what's wrong
with your friend Nikki?

05:54.184 --> 05:55.976
I know.
She just took my smoothie.

05:55.976 --> 05:57.478
Is she bringing it back?

05:57.478 --> 05:59.069
You don't do that
to somebody.

05:59.069 --> 06:00.691
No, I mean

06:00.691 --> 06:02.783
it's like she's jealous
or something.

06:02.783 --> 06:04.114
Did you two
ever go out?

06:04.114 --> 06:05.826
Oh, I see.

06:05.826 --> 06:07.367
You're wondering if you have
anything to be jealous about.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.619
Don't worry.

06:08.619 --> 06:09.750
Nikki was never
my girlfriend.

06:09.750 --> 06:11.041
She's just the girl

06:11.041 --> 06:13.414
I always wanted
and could never get.

06:13.414 --> 06:14.795
What?

06:14.795 --> 06:16.256
Yeah, you have nothing
to worry about, Emily.

06:16.256 --> 06:17.758
I asked her out,
like, dozens of times

06:17.758 --> 06:19.800
and she always said
no.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.962
So you have,
like, a crush on her?

06:21.962 --> 06:23.764
Okay,
I said that wrong.

06:23.764 --> 06:25.055
What I meant to say was,

06:25.055 --> 06:26.807
you have nothing to
worry about, Emily.

06:26.807 --> 06:29.269
And stop talking.

06:29.269 --> 06:31.271
Okay,
you know what?

06:31.271 --> 06:33.273
I don't want you hanging out
with Nikki anymore.

06:33.273 --> 06:35.065
What?
Yeah.

06:35.065 --> 06:36.396
If you want me to be
your girlfriend,

06:36.396 --> 06:37.688
she can't be your friend.

06:37.688 --> 06:39.610
Well, I do want you
to be my girlfriend.

06:39.610 --> 06:41.231
Okay.

06:41.231 --> 06:42.443
You're cool
about this, right?

06:42.443 --> 06:44.655
Yeah,
I totally understand.

06:44.655 --> 06:47.197
I'm just mad at myself
for telling you too much.

06:47.197 --> 06:49.740
I mean,
yeah, I totally understand.

06:49.740 --> 06:51.121
And stop talking.

06:55.956 --> 06:57.458
So then Emily said that
if I wanted her

06:57.458 --> 06:58.709
to be my girlfriend,

06:58.709 --> 07:00.210
I couldn't be friends
with Nikki.

07:00.210 --> 07:01.421
What did you say?

07:01.421 --> 07:02.713
Well, I said
I understood,

07:02.713 --> 07:04.545
I mean, I don't want
Emily to be upset,

07:04.545 --> 07:06.136
but Nikki's my friend.

07:06.136 --> 07:08.218
It doesn't seem right
to do that to a friend.

07:08.218 --> 07:10.140
Plus,
Nikki smells really good.

07:10.140 --> 07:11.682
Really good.

07:11.682 --> 07:12.933
As a friend.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.725
She smells really good
as a friend.

07:14.725 --> 07:16.266
I'm sorry, Tyler,

07:16.266 --> 07:17.728
but once
you have a girlfriend,

07:17.728 --> 07:20.771
you shouldn't be
smelling another girl.

07:20.771 --> 07:22.232
No matter
how much she smells like

07:22.232 --> 07:24.865
lilac and cinnamon
and moves like curtains

07:24.865 --> 07:26.827
blown by the summer breeze.

07:26.827 --> 07:28.198
Not my words--

07:28.198 --> 07:30.661
the poet laureate
of El Salvador.

07:30.661 --> 07:32.623
Lilac and cinnamon!

07:32.623 --> 07:34.334
No wonder
I think of Nikki

07:34.334 --> 07:37.037
when I'm eating churros
in Mom's bathroom.

07:37.037 --> 07:39.840
Why are you eating churros
in Mom's bathroom?

07:39.840 --> 07:42.673
I enjoy eating them
in the jacuzzi tub.

07:42.673 --> 07:44.845
Sometimes I just need
a Tyler Day.

07:44.845 --> 07:46.346
Ha, I hear that.

07:46.346 --> 07:47.718
On Stan Days,

07:47.718 --> 07:51.892
I just light incense,
play music, and cry.

07:51.892 --> 07:55.726
I mean, I chase squirrels
and roll around in the mud.

07:55.726 --> 07:57.518
Yeah,
that's what I do.

07:59.730 --> 08:00.941
Tyler,
you have to tell Nikki

08:00.941 --> 08:02.062
you can't be
friends anymore.

08:02.062 --> 08:03.734
Yeah, I guess.

08:03.734 --> 08:04.695
I just don't know
what I'm gonna say.

08:04.695 --> 08:06.607
Tell her
you think of her

08:06.607 --> 08:07.868
when you're eating churros
in Mom's bathroom.

08:07.868 --> 08:09.369
That should do the trick.

08:14.665 --> 08:18.378
Whiskers, I understand
why you have to hide here

08:18.378 --> 08:20.581
so Stan won't find you.

08:20.581 --> 08:22.583
But why does she have
to be in my office

08:22.583 --> 08:23.834
when I'm trying
to work?

08:23.834 --> 08:25.385
I'm a cat person.

08:26.386 --> 08:27.838
But not a cat lady.

08:27.838 --> 08:29.840
The difference
is the number of cats

08:29.840 --> 08:32.342
and the level of sadness.

08:32.342 --> 08:34.935
Okay. That explains
why you're here.

08:34.935 --> 08:36.767
Sort of.

08:36.767 --> 08:38.689
But why does she have
to be in my office?

08:40.811 --> 08:43.944
I like petting.
I'll pet anything.

08:43.944 --> 08:46.446
Cats, bunnies,
old folks, babies,

08:46.446 --> 08:47.738
sometimes the wall.

08:48.739 --> 08:51.281
I may have a problem.

08:51.281 --> 08:55.916
What are you guys doing?
You left the door ajar.

08:55.916 --> 08:57.417
Stan could have
wandered in.

08:57.417 --> 08:59.369
We need to keep
this cat a secret.

08:59.369 --> 09:01.081
Avery, I think
you're overreacting.

09:01.081 --> 09:03.373
It's not like
Stan is on the prowl

09:03.373 --> 09:04.965
searching for it,
or something.

09:04.965 --> 09:06.627
There's something here.

09:08.879 --> 09:11.722
Where is it?
What is it?

09:12.803 --> 09:15.596
Such a sweetie.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.678
A cat!

09:19.519 --> 09:20.641
Oh, boy.

09:23.854 --> 09:25.275
Just be cool.

09:25.275 --> 09:27.688
Like you've been here
the whole time.

09:30.821 --> 09:32.032
A cat, Avery!

09:32.032 --> 09:34.404
A cat!
Here in my house!

09:34.404 --> 09:36.867
Okay,
I get why you're upset.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.749
But Mom's just cat-sitting
for a friend.

09:38.749 --> 09:40.751
It's not like the cat
even did anything to you.

09:40.751 --> 09:42.292
Your nose isn't finely
tuned like mine,

09:42.292 --> 09:43.704
so you didn't notice,

09:43.704 --> 09:46.506
but it was farting hate
into the room.

09:46.506 --> 09:47.968
Maybe you don't understand

09:47.968 --> 09:50.300
how much dogs and cats
despise each other.

09:50.300 --> 09:51.882
Okay, Stan, I get it.

09:51.882 --> 09:54.765
You hate cats so much
that you're making stuff up.

09:54.765 --> 09:57.848
Hate farts are real!

09:57.848 --> 09:59.810
And so is a dog's
loathing of cats.

09:59.810 --> 10:01.271
Okay, I get it.

10:01.271 --> 10:02.683
It's like the Red Sox
and the Yankees.

10:02.683 --> 10:04.434
No, it's worse.

10:04.434 --> 10:06.226
Red Sox sometimes
become Yankees,

10:06.226 --> 10:07.988
but a dog would
never become a cat,

10:07.988 --> 10:10.691
no matter how much money
you offer it.

10:10.691 --> 10:13.363
How many times
do I have to say I get it?

10:13.363 --> 10:14.364
How many times
have you said it?

10:14.364 --> 10:15.615
I think three.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.037
Then, yeah,
that should do it.

10:19.790 --> 10:22.242
It figures that Ellen
would be behind this.

10:22.242 --> 10:24.705
She's always saying
how she's a cat person.

10:24.705 --> 10:26.586
She even posts
pictures of herself online

10:26.586 --> 10:27.627
wearing a cat beard.

10:30.420 --> 10:31.962
And here's a cat
with an Ellen beard.

10:34.514 --> 10:36.887
Well, if she's going to bring
a cat into the house,

10:36.887 --> 10:39.259
I'm not just going to sit here
and blog about it.

10:39.259 --> 10:40.640
I'm gonna do something.

10:42.683 --> 10:43.974
Hey, little kitty.

10:43.974 --> 10:45.856
Time for me to say
goodbye like

10:45.856 --> 10:48.108
in all the poignant
animal movies.

10:48.108 --> 10:50.691
Just go!
Get out of here!

10:50.691 --> 10:51.822
What are you waiting for?

10:51.822 --> 10:54.274
Just leave
and don't look back!

10:55.696 --> 10:56.777
Ha!

10:56.777 --> 10:59.079
Take your hate stink
somewhere else.

10:59.079 --> 11:02.202
And good luck finding
a cab this time of night.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.589
Ah, that's nice.

11:11.882 --> 11:13.343
Ah!

11:13.343 --> 11:14.755
What happened?

11:15.846 --> 11:20.600
She's so warm.
And so cuddly.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.603
How can something
so wrong feel so right?

11:27.187 --> 11:29.069
What do you mean
we can't hang out anymore?

11:29.069 --> 11:30.520
Nikki,
you're a good friend,

11:30.520 --> 11:31.982
but it makes
Emily uncomfortable.

11:31.982 --> 11:33.814
And nothing makes her
uncomfortable.

11:33.814 --> 11:35.315
Not even this.

11:38.318 --> 11:40.911
That does not make me
uncomfortable either.

11:40.911 --> 11:42.032
Really?

11:42.032 --> 11:44.534
Yes,
I like it very much.

11:44.534 --> 11:46.877
But keeping
your arm outstretched

11:46.877 --> 11:48.668
must be uncomfortable
for you,

11:48.668 --> 11:50.040
so please stop
immediately.

11:52.793 --> 11:53.834
Anyway, I'm sorry.

11:53.834 --> 11:55.295
Emily's my girlfriend

11:55.295 --> 11:56.797
and she doesn't want us
being friends.

11:56.797 --> 11:57.838
What do you want?

11:57.838 --> 11:59.299
What choice
do I have?

11:59.299 --> 12:02.342
Well, you could
break up with Emily.

12:02.342 --> 12:03.804
But then
I won't have a girlfriend.

12:04.644 --> 12:06.556
Yes, you will.

12:06.556 --> 12:07.808
No, Nikki,

12:07.808 --> 12:08.849
if I break up
with my girlfriend,

12:08.849 --> 12:10.440
then I won't have
a girlfriend.

12:10.440 --> 12:13.353
Maybe it's different
in your country.

12:13.353 --> 12:14.614
Tyler.

12:14.614 --> 12:16.616
You could have
another girlfriend.

12:16.616 --> 12:17.858
Yeah, I'm sure
I could find someone,

12:17.858 --> 12:18.949
but I don't know who.

12:18.949 --> 12:20.200
And whoever it is

12:20.200 --> 12:21.241
might still have
a problem with me

12:21.241 --> 12:22.572
being friends with you,

12:22.572 --> 12:24.244
and we'd be
right back here.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.246
Tyler,
I'm talking about me!

12:26.246 --> 12:27.747
I'll be your girlfriend!

12:27.747 --> 12:29.920
Nikki, Emily doesn't want you
to be my friend.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.923
She'll never go for you
being my girlfriend.

12:32.923 --> 12:34.965
Wait. Whoa.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.431
My world no longer
makes sense!

12:41.431 --> 12:42.933
I'm freaking out, Avery!

12:42.933 --> 12:44.264
Light the incense

12:44.264 --> 12:45.976
and crank up
my rainy day playlist.

12:45.976 --> 12:48.558
I need a Stan Day.

12:48.558 --> 12:49.980
Stan,
what's the matter?

12:49.980 --> 12:52.652
Something horrible.
Something truly horrible.

12:52.652 --> 12:54.444
I think I like a cat.

12:54.444 --> 12:56.156
( sobbing )

12:56.156 --> 12:57.607
What?

12:57.607 --> 12:58.658
I don't know
how it happened.

12:58.658 --> 12:59.779
I was lying there.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.241
Then the cat
was lying there.

13:01.241 --> 13:03.363
And it felt so good.

13:03.363 --> 13:05.495
It's okay, Stan.

13:05.495 --> 13:06.666
Your thinking on cats
is evolving

13:06.666 --> 13:08.118
and there's nothing
wrong with that.

13:08.118 --> 13:09.709
The craziest thing
just happened to me!

13:09.709 --> 13:11.541
No, the craziest thing
just happened to me!

13:11.541 --> 13:12.712
Mine is crazier.

13:12.712 --> 13:14.044
Whatever it is,
it's not as crazy as me

13:14.044 --> 13:15.335
liking a cat.

13:15.335 --> 13:17.337
Nikki wants to be
my girlfriend!

13:17.337 --> 13:18.678
You like a cat?

13:18.678 --> 13:20.881
Yeah. Nikki wants to be
your girlfriend?

13:20.881 --> 13:23.013
Yeah!

13:23.013 --> 13:25.886
Okay, it's like the world
is spinning off its axis.

13:25.886 --> 13:28.058
The laws of physics
no longer apply.

13:28.058 --> 13:31.691
The atomic weight of barium
is less than that of lithium!

13:31.691 --> 13:33.233
It's not less than
that of lithium.

13:33.233 --> 13:34.694
Not by a long shot.

13:38.778 --> 13:40.700
So what are you going
to do about Nikki?

13:40.700 --> 13:42.282
I don't know.

13:42.282 --> 13:43.783
I guess I have to choose
between her and Emily.

13:43.783 --> 13:45.205
It's really tough.

13:45.205 --> 13:47.037
I mean,
things are great with Emily.

13:47.037 --> 13:48.448
We have
so much fun together,

13:48.448 --> 13:49.829
and I know
what I have with her.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.331
Emily it is.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.873
But Nikki is the one
I've always wanted to be with.

13:52.873 --> 13:54.754
I'm thinking
maybe now Nikki.

13:55.715 --> 13:56.877
But she was
never interested.

13:56.877 --> 13:58.718
How can I trust it?

13:58.718 --> 13:59.880
Maybe she just likes me
because I'm unavailable.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.672
Boy, that Emily
is a real peach.

14:02.672 --> 14:06.136
But Nikki is Nikki.
She's just so Nikki.

14:06.136 --> 14:08.308
Back on the Nikki train.
All aboard!

14:09.599 --> 14:11.181
Stan,
you're not helping.

14:11.181 --> 14:12.933
Hey, at least you're picking
within your species.

14:12.933 --> 14:14.854
I'm cuddling
with the enemy.

14:14.854 --> 14:15.976
Oh, look at that.

14:15.976 --> 14:18.608
She's grooming me.

14:18.608 --> 14:21.691
She's so thoughtful.
She always puts me first.

14:22.943 --> 14:24.654
Help me, Avery.
What should I do?

14:24.654 --> 14:27.407
Tyler, in the couple of years
I've known you,

14:27.407 --> 14:30.080
I've compiled a binder
with solutions to problems

14:30.080 --> 14:31.331
you might encounter--

14:31.331 --> 14:33.583
as kind of
a mental exercise.

14:33.583 --> 14:36.296
It's 400 pages long

14:36.296 --> 14:39.129
and divided into
17 subchapters.

14:39.129 --> 14:40.800
Two girls liking you
is not in there.

14:41.801 --> 14:43.303
Ow!

14:43.303 --> 14:44.965
My finger is stuck
in the pinchy thing.

14:44.965 --> 14:46.136
Oh, that's on page three.

14:49.849 --> 14:51.601
So what should I do
about Emily and Nikki?

14:51.601 --> 14:53.813
Tyler, I'm glad
you came to me.

14:53.813 --> 14:56.686
I have studied
the cognitive process of

14:56.686 --> 14:58.818
decision making extensively

14:58.818 --> 15:00.440
from a psychological
standpoint,

15:00.440 --> 15:02.862
and I've concluded
that the human mind

15:02.862 --> 15:06.326
will make the wrong decision
half the time.

15:06.326 --> 15:10.030
You might as well take this coin
and toss it in the air.

15:10.030 --> 15:12.993
Heads is Nikki
and tails is Emily.

15:12.993 --> 15:16.796
You know,
Ellen was heads.

15:16.796 --> 15:20.210
Sometimes I wonder
whatever happened to tails.

15:21.671 --> 15:24.304
Never break up
with a girl, Tyler.

15:24.304 --> 15:26.006
It hurts them too much.

15:26.006 --> 15:27.847
You may think
that you can say it in a way

15:27.847 --> 15:29.849
that will cushion the blow,
but you can't.

15:29.849 --> 15:31.431
Oh, I've heard them all.

15:31.431 --> 15:34.514
"It's not you, it's me,"
"It's pretty much you,"

15:34.514 --> 15:36.226
"It's definitely you,"

15:36.226 --> 15:39.899
"The security camera says
it was you."

15:39.899 --> 15:42.732
One is as painful to hear
as the next.

15:42.732 --> 15:44.404
But you don't know
heartache

15:44.404 --> 15:47.697
until you've been dumped
by a boy's entire family.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.369
They just surrounded
their son

15:49.369 --> 15:51.371
and screamed at me
in Portuguese.

15:51.371 --> 15:53.033
( speaking in foreign language )

15:56.666 --> 15:58.038
"Leave now,
crazy woman."

16:00.040 --> 16:03.923
Tyler, I had to choose
between two dolls once.

16:03.923 --> 16:06.296
I couldn't decide
which I wanted more,

16:06.296 --> 16:08.588
so I put both their heads
on one body.

16:08.588 --> 16:09.759
You should do that.

16:14.974 --> 16:18.768
Amy likes scones.
Wanda likes biscuits.

16:18.768 --> 16:20.690
Tea parties are cray.

16:24.774 --> 16:27.107
Everyone!
I made my decision!

16:28.108 --> 16:29.489
Also, I found a gong.

16:33.373 --> 16:35.075
Thank you all
for your advice.

16:35.075 --> 16:36.706
I've thought about
this long and hard.

16:36.706 --> 16:38.378
And I know which girl
I want to be with.

16:38.378 --> 16:40.750
Oh, that's great, Son.
Who's the lucky girl?

16:40.750 --> 16:42.962
Well, who's the girl
you chose?

16:42.962 --> 16:45.385
Which one is lucky
might be a matter of opinion.

16:45.385 --> 16:48.258
It's only fair
I tell her first.

16:48.258 --> 16:50.680
As I present her this.

16:50.680 --> 16:52.552
Flip the coin.

16:52.552 --> 16:53.843
Don't hurt her.

16:53.843 --> 16:55.475
Two heads.

17:04.854 --> 17:06.406
I choose you.

17:06.406 --> 17:08.648
What do you mean,
you choose me?

17:08.648 --> 17:09.779
For what?

17:09.779 --> 17:11.281
Oh, right,
you don't even know.

17:11.281 --> 17:12.782
Nikki wants
to be my girlfriend,

17:12.782 --> 17:13.743
so I've been
wrestling with it,

17:13.743 --> 17:15.825
asking everyone
for advice.

17:15.825 --> 17:17.707
But I finally decided
what to do.

17:17.707 --> 17:20.210
I choose you.

17:20.210 --> 17:21.831
You're such a jerk.

17:21.831 --> 17:24.834
Maybe you didn't hear me.
I choose you.

17:24.834 --> 17:26.756
I can't believe you were
thinking about dumping me.

17:26.756 --> 17:28.378
But I choose you?

17:30.630 --> 17:31.671
Ow. Thorns.

17:33.383 --> 17:35.765
I thought everything was going
so great between us.

17:35.765 --> 17:38.228
It was.
And that's why I chose you.

17:38.228 --> 17:39.769
Nikki's just like
some dream girl.

17:39.769 --> 17:41.851
I don't know
if I can even trust it.

17:41.851 --> 17:42.942
But what
we have is real.

17:42.942 --> 17:44.944
It's safe
and comfortable.

17:44.944 --> 17:46.646
Give me the rose back.

17:49.239 --> 17:51.030
I'm not safe
and comfortable!

17:52.242 --> 17:53.493
Well, not when you
go around

17:53.493 --> 17:55.655
throwing roses
at people like that.

17:55.655 --> 17:57.907
Hey, if Nikki's
your dream girl,

17:57.907 --> 17:59.119
go for it.

17:59.119 --> 18:01.541
I care about you,
Emily.

18:01.541 --> 18:03.123
I don't want to
hurt you.

18:03.123 --> 18:04.874
I've seen what that can
do to a woman later in life.

18:04.874 --> 18:06.296
It's not pretty.

18:06.296 --> 18:08.128
Dude, I'm fine.

18:08.128 --> 18:09.709
And hey, I don't want
to be with someone

18:09.709 --> 18:11.010
who doesn't think
I'm his dream girl.

18:11.010 --> 18:13.473
I'm sorry.

18:13.473 --> 18:14.674
You're being really cool
about this.

18:14.674 --> 18:16.426
That's because I'm cool.

18:16.426 --> 18:18.138
And I love that
in a girl.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.639
You know, if this thing
with Nikki doesn't work out--

18:19.639 --> 18:20.680
And stop talking.

18:27.567 --> 18:29.489
What did you do?

18:29.489 --> 18:32.652
I decided if I'm a cat lover,
I might as well embrace it.

18:34.654 --> 18:37.737
I invited
all the neighborhood cats over.

18:37.737 --> 18:39.289
How'd you get 'em
all here?

18:39.289 --> 18:40.870
I can't tell you.

18:40.870 --> 18:43.743
Let's just say it involved
a lizard and a string.

18:43.743 --> 18:45.665
Okay, I just told you.

18:45.665 --> 18:48.127
I don't know
where to start petting.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.710
I've always dreamed
this would happen.

18:50.710 --> 18:52.842
If I look outside and
there's a unicorn and a rainbow,

18:52.842 --> 18:54.714
I'm gonna freak.

18:55.925 --> 18:57.717
But they're
driving me crazy, Chloe.

18:57.717 --> 18:59.349
They're ungrateful,
entitled,

18:59.349 --> 19:00.720
and think
they're better than everyone.

19:00.720 --> 19:04.394
It's like being
with a bunch of sorority girls.

19:04.394 --> 19:08.188
I like Whiskers,
but I hate these cats.

19:08.188 --> 19:09.939
I'm more confused
than ever, Chloe.

19:09.939 --> 19:11.441
Today in school,

19:11.441 --> 19:12.572
we learned that you have
to judge people

19:12.572 --> 19:13.863
by who they are.

19:13.863 --> 19:15.114
Not by the color
of their skin

19:15.114 --> 19:16.536
or what country
they come from.

19:16.536 --> 19:17.737
Oh, so you're saying,

19:17.737 --> 19:19.869
I can like one cat
as an individual,

19:19.869 --> 19:22.202
but I don't have to like
all cats as a group.

19:22.202 --> 19:24.704
No. I was just telling you
what we learned in school.

19:24.704 --> 19:26.546
It had nothing
to do with cats.

19:26.546 --> 19:28.708
We also did times tables.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.005
I choose you.

19:36.005 --> 19:38.798
Oh, Tyler,
I am so happy.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.222
Why is my rose bent?

19:42.222 --> 19:45.565
That's because Emily kept
throwing it at me.

19:45.565 --> 19:47.767
Why did Emily
have my rose?

19:47.767 --> 19:48.768
Funny story.

19:48.768 --> 19:50.230
I gave it to Emily first--

19:50.230 --> 19:51.651
that's not
the funny part.

19:51.651 --> 19:52.772
She made me realize

19:52.772 --> 19:54.574
I should go
after my dream girl

19:54.574 --> 19:56.736
and not worry about
whether I can trust it.

19:56.736 --> 19:58.238
And you're
my dream girl.

19:58.238 --> 20:00.320
Still not funny.

20:00.320 --> 20:02.822
Well, not "laughing"
funny so much as

20:02.822 --> 20:05.325
"can you believe
I told you all that" funny.

20:06.536 --> 20:07.997
You picked Emily first?

20:07.997 --> 20:09.789
Uh...

20:09.789 --> 20:11.130
did you hear the part about
you're my dream girl?

20:11.130 --> 20:12.832
And you don't know
if you can trust it?

20:12.832 --> 20:14.714
Dream girl?

20:14.714 --> 20:15.715
You're such a jerk.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.837
Ow. Thorns again.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.720
Nikki, wait.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.344
I can't believe it.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.187
I had two girls into me
and now I have none.

20:28.187 --> 20:31.351
I can't believe in two years
you're going to vote.

20:31.351 --> 20:32.902
So what do I do?

20:32.902 --> 20:35.655
Just give me your ballot
and I'll take care of it.

20:35.655 --> 20:37.947
No, about Nikki.
What do I do about Nikki?

20:37.947 --> 20:40.780
So Nikki's really the one
you want?

20:42.201 --> 20:44.914
It's always been Nikki.

20:44.914 --> 20:46.165
How am I going
to win her back?

20:47.827 --> 20:49.869
The heart wants
what it wants.

20:49.869 --> 20:52.712
But sometimes you don't know
what the heart wants.

20:52.712 --> 20:55.545
Wouldn't it be great
if the heart could talk?

20:55.545 --> 20:57.837
Then it could tell you
what it wants.

20:57.837 --> 20:59.339
I want to go to college!

20:59.339 --> 21:02.682
I keep telling you,
you can't leave my body.

21:02.682 --> 21:05.305
You don't want me
to be happy.

21:08.688 --> 21:10.850
Oh, Tyler,
one other piece of advice

21:10.850 --> 21:12.812
I forgot to give you
yesterday.

21:12.812 --> 21:15.655
Make sure the girl that you pick
never knows that

21:15.655 --> 21:17.026
there was ever a doubt.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.277
Thanks, Dad.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.489
And watch out
for that mailbox

21:19.489 --> 21:21.240
you ran over last week.

21:21.240 --> 21:23.202
I think it's a little late
to be telling me that now.

21:23.202 --> 21:24.614
Exactly!

21:26.786 --> 21:28.037
Whiskers could not
have been

21:28.037 --> 21:29.078
a more delightful
house guest.

21:29.078 --> 21:30.620
And the sweetest thing is

21:30.620 --> 21:32.832
how she and Stan
became best friends.

21:32.832 --> 21:34.253
Hey, Stan.

21:34.253 --> 21:37.417
Say goodbye to Whiskers
before she goes.

21:37.417 --> 21:38.838
Goodbye, dear friend.

21:38.838 --> 21:40.590
We haven't known
each other long.

21:40.590 --> 21:42.972
But when two souls connect,
then--

21:42.972 --> 21:44.844
( Whiskers screeching )

21:44.844 --> 21:46.806
Yeah, okay,
I hate cats.
