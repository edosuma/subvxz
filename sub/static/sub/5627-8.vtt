WEBVTT

00:46.000 --> 00:48.790
You'd think this kid
would learn how to text by now.

00:48.790 --> 00:51.080
Anyway, Reid says his mom's doing
much better and he misses us.

00:51.080 --> 00:54.880
-That's great news.
-Oh. Good morning, JJ.

00:54.880 --> 00:57.210
What's goin' on,
a little morning-after blues?

00:57.210 --> 00:59.420
Wait, let me guess, let me guess.

00:59.420 --> 01:02.460
Date night. Romantic dinner and a movie.

01:02.460 --> 01:03.960
Derek, I don't think that's what it is.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.250
No, no, come on, come on.
There was probably

01:05.250 --> 01:06.960
a little wine involved to set the mood

01:06.960 --> 01:09.580
and then you finished it off
with a little hanky panky.

01:11.170 --> 01:12.330
I'm way off, aren't I?

01:13.000 --> 01:16.540
You're cute. But the only action
happening at our house at 3 a.m.

01:16.540 --> 01:17.960
is a colicky baby.

01:17.960 --> 01:19.500
Gas? I'm guessing a lot of it.

01:19.500 --> 01:21.420
-Yeah.
-

01:21.420 --> 01:23.960
Colicky. I knew that. I knew that.

01:26.330 --> 01:28.670
Hi, I'm Tara Lewis.
It's great to officially meet you.

01:28.670 --> 01:30.830
Same here. I've heard so much about you.

01:30.830 --> 01:33.250
So I'm assuming sleep
is a thing of the past at your house?

01:33.250 --> 01:36.210
Uh, you know, everyone said
two was a game-changer.

01:36.210 --> 01:39.120
We were expecting twice the work, but wow.

01:40.880 --> 01:42.580
Hey, Rossi.

01:42.580 --> 01:44.540
Where's Hotch and Garcia?
I thought we had a case.

01:45.080 --> 01:47.880
We do, but they're behind closed doors.

01:47.880 --> 01:49.580
Is this about the network of hitmen?

01:49.580 --> 01:50.710
Yeah.

01:50.710 --> 01:52.170
Any update?

01:52.170 --> 01:54.290
Nothing yet, but Hotch
has pulled out all the stops.

01:54.670 --> 01:55.960
How's she doing?

01:55.960 --> 01:59.620
She's got four hitmen targeting her,
so she's a little rattled.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.880
Yeah, I heard something
about witness protection.

02:02.880 --> 02:04.460
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

02:07.750 --> 02:08.920
For how long?

02:08.920 --> 02:10.750
Until we can produce a viable lead.

02:10.750 --> 02:13.620
You'll be here and an agent will be
assigned to you until further notice.

02:14.330 --> 02:15.540
This is horrible.

02:15.540 --> 02:18.000
Witness protection
wanted to move you to another state.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.540
I convinced them that
you would be safer here.

02:20.330 --> 02:22.500
Thank you for that. Um...

02:23.330 --> 02:27.000
Okay, I need to go home
and get my creature comfort things.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.920
Garcia, this starts now.

02:28.920 --> 02:31.620
What do you... What about Sergio?

02:31.620 --> 02:33.250
I have plants I need to water...

02:33.250 --> 02:36.330
Make a list and I'll send someone
to pick up whatever you need.

02:36.330 --> 02:37.540
Okay.

02:45.920 --> 02:47.170
Wait.

02:49.790 --> 02:51.170
Thank you. Oh.

02:52.290 --> 02:53.790
Who's getting the stuff?

02:54.040 --> 02:55.290
Anderson.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.540
He can't see that.

02:57.790 --> 03:00.330
But I really need it.

03:00.330 --> 03:02.710
Garcia. Let's get to work.

03:03.290 --> 03:04.920
Right.

03:04.920 --> 03:06.460
The Phoenix division
is requesting our help

03:06.460 --> 03:09.380
with two recent abductions,
one of which has led to murder.

03:09.380 --> 03:13.380
Uh, okay. Five days ago,
the body of Steven Jackson

03:13.380 --> 03:16.580
was discovered
on a rural road just outside the city.

03:16.580 --> 03:18.670
He was reported missing
after missing several shifts at work.

03:18.670 --> 03:21.290
Which brings us to our second victim,
Lance Coleman.

03:21.290 --> 03:24.830
According to authorities, three days ago
he was due home in Phoenix

03:24.830 --> 03:26.120
from a business trip in Tucson.

03:26.120 --> 03:28.420
And security footage shows
him entering the airport,

03:28.420 --> 03:30.580
but the flight manifest
says he never got on the plane.

03:30.580 --> 03:32.250
It's as if these two vanished.

03:32.250 --> 03:34.540
On average, over 90,000
people go missing each year.

03:34.540 --> 03:37.670
54% of those are men.
Only 15% return alive.

03:38.250 --> 03:40.830
Their preliminary M.E. report
shows deep ligature marks

03:40.830 --> 03:42.750
and lacerations on Steven's wrists.

03:42.750 --> 03:45.540
He was likely restrained
for an extended period of time.

03:45.540 --> 03:48.380
Which means the UnSub
has a secure secondary location

03:48.380 --> 03:49.620
where he holds them captive.

03:49.620 --> 03:51.540
It says here Steven
suffered repeated burns

03:51.540 --> 03:53.290
and contusions all over his body.

03:53.290 --> 03:56.420
Extreme torture. The UnSub's found
an outlet for his aggression.

03:56.420 --> 03:58.500
No obvious signs of sexual assault.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.960
The torture could be
what's getting him off.

04:00.960 --> 04:03.420
That makes sense.
He gets sexual gratification

04:03.420 --> 04:06.460
from inflicting psychological
and physical suffering on his victims.

04:06.460 --> 04:08.920
Well, this level of violence
suggests that it's personal.

04:08.920 --> 04:10.250
Maybe it's about revenge.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.670
These two crossed the UnSub,
now he wants to make them pay.

04:12.670 --> 04:15.120
Or at the very least,
he's using them as surrogates

04:15.120 --> 04:16.790
for the true target of his anger.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.830
It's possible he was testing
to see just how much torture

04:18.830 --> 04:20.710
Steven could take before he'd break.

04:20.710 --> 04:22.790
Well, Coleman's been missing
for over 72 hours.

04:22.790 --> 04:26.460
If revenge is the UnSub's motivation,
he could already be dead.

04:26.460 --> 04:28.040
Well, unless we have reason
to believe otherwise,

04:28.040 --> 04:30.330
we have to assume Lance Coleman's alive,
and we need to find him.

04:30.330 --> 04:31.580
Wheels up in 20.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.330
Hey!

05:00.580 --> 05:02.170
Over here!

05:02.170 --> 05:03.380
Hey!

05:03.380 --> 05:05.040
Oh, God!

05:05.580 --> 05:07.040
Over here!

05:07.040 --> 05:10.540
This is Chopper 482.
We have a visual on Lance Coleman.

05:10.540 --> 05:13.250
I repeat, we have
a visual on Lance Coleman.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.290
Help me!

05:17.500 --> 05:18.670
Help me.

05:19.460 --> 05:20.620
Wake up!

05:22.330 --> 05:23.620
I said, wake up!

05:26.330 --> 05:27.790
No.

05:27.790 --> 05:29.000
No.

05:31.710 --> 05:32.790
Look at me.

05:33.580 --> 05:34.750
Look at me.

05:35.790 --> 05:37.210
We're just getting started.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.120
"You can chain me, you can torture me,

06:15.120 --> 06:17.460
"you can even destroy this body,

06:17.460 --> 06:19.750
"but you will never imprison my mind."

06:19.750 --> 06:21.000
Mahatma Gandhi.

06:24.080 --> 06:26.670
-Hey. Uh, did you want a cup?
-

06:26.670 --> 06:29.290
Oh. Right, right. The whole, um...

06:29.920 --> 06:32.420
-Yeah. -Yeah. I'm still nursing.

06:32.420 --> 06:35.670
That's okay. Only 45 days,
three hours, and six minutes left,

06:35.670 --> 06:38.040
-but who's counting?
-You're really not messing around.

06:38.040 --> 06:40.500
No, you don't stand
between a woman and her caffeine.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.620
Well, listen, when your sentence is up,
first cup's on me.

06:42.620 --> 06:43.750
-Deal.
-

06:43.750 --> 06:46.290
Besides being residents
of one of the hottest...

06:46.290 --> 06:47.670
And I'm sure they're all pleasant-looking,

06:47.670 --> 06:49.540
but I'm talking Fahrenheit here...
Cities in the country,

06:49.540 --> 06:51.460
I can't find any connections
between the victims.

06:51.460 --> 06:54.500
Garcia, what about Lance's
credit cards

06:54.500 --> 06:57.330
Uh, his last transaction
was a car service to the airport.

06:57.330 --> 06:58.500
Besides that, it's a ghost town.

06:58.500 --> 07:01.960
Both vics appear to be low-risk.
It speaks to the UnSub's confidence.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.790
Steven looks like
he practically lived at the gym.

07:03.790 --> 07:05.420
They couldn't be more
physically different.

07:05.420 --> 07:07.170
Well, he definitely
lived the bachelor's lifestyle...

07:07.170 --> 07:08.830
Single, he rented a studio apartment,

07:08.830 --> 07:10.710
worked freelance
as an overnight security guard.

07:10.710 --> 07:12.960
Lance Coleman was the opposite.
He's a family man.

07:12.960 --> 07:15.580
Been married to his
wife Karen for nearly 20 years.

07:15.580 --> 07:17.210
And he also owned
his own business.

07:17.210 --> 07:19.580
He would take weekly
commuter flights to Tucson

07:19.580 --> 07:21.250
to meet with potential investors.

07:21.250 --> 07:24.330
Maybe the UnSub's motivation
is business related, not personal.

07:24.330 --> 07:27.120
Garcia, see if Steven ever worked
security for Lance's company.

07:27.120 --> 07:28.460
-Gotcha.-

07:28.460 --> 07:30.250
All right, so how did he
get to these guys?

07:30.250 --> 07:32.420
I'm leaning towards a blitz attack.

07:32.420 --> 07:33.710
Uh, these look like electrical burns.

07:33.710 --> 07:35.960
The UnSub could be using
some kind of a Taser.

07:35.960 --> 07:38.500
Both victims went missing
while traveling at night.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.420
That speaks to the UnSub's
knowledge of their schedules.

07:40.420 --> 07:43.170
He may have stalked them
over an extended period of time.

07:43.170 --> 07:45.420
Which is how he knew
the most opportune moment to strike.

07:45.420 --> 07:48.210
There are no witnesses, no cameras.
They're simply gone.

07:48.210 --> 07:50.210
He targeted these men for a reason.

07:50.210 --> 07:53.290
The sooner we find out why,
the sooner we'll find Lance.

07:57.460 --> 07:59.790
Agent Hotchner? Thanks for coming out.

07:59.790 --> 08:01.750
Agent Webster, this is
Agent Jareau, Agent Rossi.

08:01.750 --> 08:03.330
Welcome. Right this way.

08:03.960 --> 08:06.670
So we've checked local hospitals
and accident reports.

08:06.670 --> 08:08.330
No one matches Coleman's description.

08:08.330 --> 08:09.790
What about Tucson

08:09.790 --> 08:11.380
Well, they're coming up empty, too.

08:11.380 --> 08:13.830
Have you been able to get
ahold of Steven Jackson's family?

08:13.830 --> 08:16.540
His parents live up north.
They're driving in as we speak.

08:16.540 --> 08:17.670
And Mrs. Coleman?

08:17.670 --> 08:20.880
She arrived five minutes ago.
Figured you want to talk to her first.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.170
I have you guys set up in here.
Right this way.

08:25.170 --> 08:26.580
Thank you.

08:30.500 --> 08:33.460
Hi, Mrs. Coleman? I'm Agent Jareau.

08:33.460 --> 08:34.620
No, please sit.

08:34.620 --> 08:37.540
I'm sorry.
-Oh, you don't need to apologize.

08:37.540 --> 08:39.170
I haven't slept since...

08:39.170 --> 08:41.880
That's understandable.

08:41.880 --> 08:45.330
Mrs. Coleman, when was the last
time you heard from your husband?

08:45.330 --> 08:47.000
Three nights ago.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Is that typical?

08:49.000 --> 08:50.790
He hates being away from us.

08:51.750 --> 08:55.500
We have a rule that he won't spend
more than two nights away on business.

08:55.920 --> 08:57.960
And did he ever break that promise?

08:57.960 --> 08:59.290
Not in 20 years.

09:00.830 --> 09:03.460
At what point did you
realize he was missing?

09:03.460 --> 09:06.620
Not until I woke up and he wasn't there.

09:08.210 --> 09:10.380
I called his cell. Voicemail.

09:11.330 --> 09:15.540
I tried the hotel. They said he was gone.

09:15.540 --> 09:17.330
And that's when you knew
something was wrong.

09:20.210 --> 09:24.830
This coming weekend we were going
to be celebrating our anniversary.

09:24.830 --> 09:27.210
He'd been planning a getaway for months.

09:29.170 --> 09:32.210
There's no way Lance would have missed it.

09:41.580 --> 09:43.000
What have you got, Garcia?

09:43.000 --> 09:46.540
I'm trying to locate
the last ping of Lance's cell phone,

09:46.540 --> 09:48.710
but I can't narrow it down
to an exact tower yet.

09:48.710 --> 09:50.170
How is that possible?

09:50.170 --> 09:52.960
Ping-a-cell 101. If I could
direct your attention to the map.

09:53.420 --> 09:56.210
According to his last ping at 11 p.m.,

09:56.210 --> 09:58.540
the signal was bouncing off
a tower in Benson, Arizona.

09:58.540 --> 09:59.920
But that doesn't fit the timeline.

09:59.920 --> 10:02.210
10 p.m.

10:02.210 --> 10:04.080
It doesn't make sense.
What makes even less sense

10:04.080 --> 10:06.460
is that five minutes later,
the signal was bouncing

10:06.460 --> 10:09.120
off a tower in Drexel Heights
50 miles away.

10:09.120 --> 10:10.290
That's impossible.

10:10.290 --> 10:11.580
Yeah, this is what I'm saying.

10:11.580 --> 10:14.120
The signal is tower hopping.
It's giving a false read.

10:14.120 --> 10:15.830
Because the cell tower was full.

10:15.830 --> 10:17.540
Correctamundo.
The signal will automatically

10:17.540 --> 10:20.000
bounce to the next available tower
even if it's out of the city.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.670
That means the UnSub's hunting ground
may be far bigger than we thought.

10:23.830 --> 10:26.080
The brutality the victim
experienced was immense.

10:26.080 --> 10:29.420
He suffered facial fractures,
burns, and extensive bruising.

10:29.420 --> 10:30.710
Have you determined COD?

10:30.710 --> 10:32.330
I haven't finalized my findings,

10:32.330 --> 10:35.290
but preliminarily I'd say
he died from cardiac arrest

10:35.290 --> 10:37.210
induced by electric shock.

10:37.210 --> 10:39.420
Still trying to figure out
what caused these.

10:39.420 --> 10:41.540
Look at him. This is complete overkill.

10:41.540 --> 10:43.750
Well, the fact that the UnSub
is stepping up his method of torture

10:43.750 --> 10:45.540
could mean he's getting frustrated.

10:45.540 --> 10:47.210
It's possible he's ex-military.

10:47.210 --> 10:49.500
It would explain his knowledge
of multiple torture techniques.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.120
Or the guy used Google.

10:51.120 --> 10:53.420
Trust me, I've seen
all sorts of crazy stuff.

10:53.420 --> 10:54.710
Well, that wouldn't be the first time

10:54.710 --> 10:56.580
someone used the Internet
as a killing manual.

10:56.580 --> 10:58.040
Well, typically these type of tactics

10:58.040 --> 10:59.420
are used to get
a confession or information.

11:01.670 --> 11:02.960
Well, what caused these?

11:02.960 --> 11:05.170
It appears at some point
during the torture,

11:05.170 --> 11:06.960
the killer staples his eyelids open.

11:07.250 --> 11:10.500
It might be symbolic.

11:10.500 --> 11:13.210
The victims could have turned a blind eye
to something that affected the UnSub.

11:13.210 --> 11:14.670
And now he's punishing them for it.

11:14.670 --> 11:17.080
The worst part is, it was done while this
guy was still alive.

11:18.080 --> 11:21.500
This UnSub wanted Steven to
anticipate and witness his own torture.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.080
Open your eyes.
-

11:28.420 --> 11:29.620
You know where she is.

11:29.620 --> 11:31.540
I swear, I don't know
what you're talking about.

11:31.540 --> 11:33.460
Tell me.
-Please just let me go.

11:35.750 --> 11:37.040
No! No, please!

11:38.380 --> 11:39.620
I need the location.

11:39.880 --> 11:43.250
Okay. Okay. I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

11:44.920 --> 11:45.920
Focus!

11:47.670 --> 11:49.500
- -

11:50.250 --> 11:53.750
Steve was a good guy.
Hope you find the psycho who did this.

11:53.750 --> 11:55.420
We have every intention.

11:55.420 --> 11:56.580
Have at it.

11:56.580 --> 11:58.500
Let me know if there's
anything else you need.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.830
Thank you.

12:02.460 --> 12:05.290
Well, no signs of a struggle
or forced entry.

12:05.290 --> 12:07.380
The UnSub didn't abduct Steven from here.

12:07.380 --> 12:10.750
According to his supervisor, he was
supposed to start his shift at 3 a.m.

12:10.750 --> 12:12.250
So his drive would have
been about an hour.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.880
15 a.m.
That's about right.

12:19.420 --> 12:23.670
Single guy.
I'd say 15 minutes, max, to get ready.

12:23.670 --> 12:27.040
Well, he's a security guard.
Which means he wears a uniform every day,

12:27.040 --> 12:30.460
so he wouldn't have to
think about wardrobe choices.

12:30.460 --> 12:32.420
30 a.m.

12:32.420 --> 12:35.080
So he brews a pot of coffee, pours a cup.

12:36.540 --> 12:39.380
Sports fan.
Probably checked last night's scores

12:39.380 --> 12:41.670
45.

12:43.750 --> 12:45.040
Keys are gone.

12:45.040 --> 12:47.620
His car was missing
from his parking stall.

12:47.620 --> 12:50.540
Then the UnSub must have intercepted him

12:50.540 --> 12:52.960
at some point between here and work.

12:52.960 --> 12:55.920
Which begs the question,
what did he do with Steven's car?

13:03.580 --> 13:05.250
According to DMV records,

13:05.250 --> 13:07.210
Steven Jackson drove a '91 Mustang.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.170
Older model, so no GPS.

13:10.170 --> 13:12.290
I went ahead and issued an APB on his car.

13:12.290 --> 13:14.750
- -Hopefully we get a hit soon.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.120
Hey, baby girl,
you're on speaker, what's up?

13:17.120 --> 13:20.750
Okay, I did some spelunking and found
that after Coleman missed his flight,

13:20.750 --> 13:23.420
he used not his personal
but his company credit card

13:23.420 --> 13:25.120
to foot the bill for a rental car.

13:25.120 --> 13:26.620
Well, it's about an hour and a half drive,

13:26.620 --> 13:28.670
he probably figured he'd make it home
before his wife woke up.

13:28.670 --> 13:30.830
Can you track down the rental car's GPS?

13:30.830 --> 13:32.620
I already meowed up that tree.

13:32.620 --> 13:34.040
It is disabled.

13:34.040 --> 13:36.920
But I am piecing together
the GPS history as we speak.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.380
That's why you're the best, Mama.

13:38.380 --> 13:41.080
-Oh, don't I know it.
-

13:41.080 --> 13:44.620
He could have taken a number of
different routes back to Phoenix.

13:44.620 --> 13:47.500
Highway 77, 87, or 10.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.080
Well, he would have
taken the fastest route back.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.330
That'd be Interstate 10.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.710
Okay, what if he's
abducting them off the road?

13:52.710 --> 13:54.380
This could be about road rage.

13:54.380 --> 13:56.540
A perceived slight while driving
might have made them a target.

13:56.540 --> 13:59.880
An extreme case of road rage that leads
to abduction and murder.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.420
But if that's true,
the victims' cars

14:01.420 --> 14:03.420
would have been abandoned.
Both are still missing.

14:03.420 --> 14:05.040
What if they're carjackings?

14:05.040 --> 14:08.330
Think about it. The UnSub lies in wait,
he blitzes the victim at an intersection,

14:08.330 --> 14:09.710
and then he drives off in their cars.

14:09.710 --> 14:12.710
So these victims weren't targeted,
they were picked at random.

14:12.710 --> 14:14.040
Wrong place, wrong time.

14:14.040 --> 14:16.620
It is possible he used
a similar ruse like Gary Lee Sampson,

14:16.620 --> 14:18.960
who posed as a hitchhiker
and preyed on good Samaritans.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.620
Probably waves down a passing car.

14:35.540 --> 14:37.710
Hi. Hi, sir. Thank you.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.080
I don't mean to...

14:39.080 --> 14:40.420
And appears lost or incoherent.

14:40.420 --> 14:41.540
I had an accident down the road.

14:41.540 --> 14:44.170
I was hoping you could get me
to a phone or something.

14:44.170 --> 14:46.380
Claims his car broke down,
his phone is dead.

14:46.380 --> 14:47.620
He needs directions or a ride.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.750
Thank you so much, I really appreciate it.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.210
Thank you so much.

14:55.210 --> 14:57.880
And the next thing you know,
you're looking down the barrel of a gun.

14:58.420 --> 14:59.920
And the good deed is punished.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.460
I told you I wouldn't miss it.

15:12.380 --> 15:15.580
Oh, my God! Honey!

15:18.250 --> 15:20.790
Oh, I was so worried! I thought...

15:22.920 --> 15:24.460
Shh.

15:24.460 --> 15:25.960
Everything's going to be all right.

15:28.670 --> 15:30.960
Why didn't you just tell him?

15:32.880 --> 15:34.250
What are you talking about?

15:36.580 --> 15:38.620
You should have given him the location.

15:49.420 --> 15:50.670
You don't have to do this.

15:51.330 --> 15:52.580
Just let me go.

15:52.580 --> 15:54.040
Please, just let me go.

15:54.580 --> 15:56.380
Please.

15:56.380 --> 15:58.710
I have a family. Don't do this to them.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.120
You have children?

16:06.710 --> 16:08.000
Yes.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.750
Yes, my daughter.

16:09.750 --> 16:10.880
She's 12.

16:10.880 --> 16:13.120
Oh, God, please, I'll do anything.

16:32.380 --> 16:34.880
Crime scene techs are done,
the site's ours.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.580
They just made a positive ID.

16:40.290 --> 16:41.540
It's Lance Coleman.

16:55.750 --> 16:57.120
Well, he definitely amped up the torture.

16:57.120 --> 16:59.170
Well, it looks like
this time, the cause of death

16:59.170 --> 17:01.580
was a single gunshot to the head.

17:01.580 --> 17:03.250
We profiled he's a sadist.

17:03.250 --> 17:05.120
He would have
inflicted as much pain as possible,

17:05.120 --> 17:08.250
not end the torture so abruptly.

17:08.250 --> 17:10.880
Well, he decreased the time
he held on to the victims,

17:10.880 --> 17:13.580
but he definitely increased
and accelerated the torture.

17:13.580 --> 17:16.460
Then it's not about pain for the thrill,
he wants something from them.

17:16.460 --> 17:18.710
But if that's true,
maybe Lance gave the UnSub

17:18.710 --> 17:20.710
what he wanted and he was
no longer of use to him.

17:20.710 --> 17:22.920
It's possible Steven's
death was an accident.

17:22.920 --> 17:25.540
Yeah. He died before
the UnSub was finished with him.

17:25.540 --> 17:26.880
We need to deliver the profile.

18:05.790 --> 18:08.880
The unknown subject we're looking for
is a sadistic inquisitor,

18:08.880 --> 18:12.080
which means that he's aroused sexually
and emotionally by causing pain

18:12.080 --> 18:14.080
in the service of eliciting information.

18:14.080 --> 18:17.500
The UnSub gets off on the fact
that his victims put up resistance.

18:17.500 --> 18:20.620
It allows him to push
the torture even further.

18:20.620 --> 18:23.750
We think he's a white male,
in his 30s to early 40s

18:23.750 --> 18:26.000
who's physically
fit enough to subdue male victims.

18:30.880 --> 18:33.210
He's goal-oriented, driven by rage,

18:33.210 --> 18:36.330
which makes him
extremely brutal in his torture methods.

18:36.330 --> 18:39.170
This UnSub exerts
power and control over his victims,

18:39.170 --> 18:40.670
making them feel completely helpless

18:40.670 --> 18:42.920
until they give him
whatever it is he's looking for.

18:42.920 --> 18:45.080
Based upon his systematic torture,

18:45.080 --> 18:48.120
it's possible the UnSub is
suffering from some sort of PTSD.

19:19.040 --> 19:20.670
- -

19:26.210 --> 19:28.120
Given the sheer amount of work and effort

19:28.120 --> 19:29.580
he puts into torturing his victims,

19:29.580 --> 19:31.380
we think there's
a deep-seated personal reason

19:31.380 --> 19:32.790
for what the UnSub is doing.

19:32.790 --> 19:36.000
It's possible he appears
unassuming with limited social skills,

19:36.000 --> 19:38.040
which is why he chooses to hunt at night.

20:17.960 --> 20:20.670
He plays on his victim's
good will and sympathy

20:20.670 --> 20:22.920
before he blitzes them
and abducts them from their vehicles.

20:22.920 --> 20:24.620
Because of the escalating torture,

20:24.620 --> 20:28.750
we believe this UnSub is becoming
both increasingly desperate and volatile.

20:28.750 --> 20:32.250
This UnSub is driven by a compulsion,
a need-based desire.

20:32.250 --> 20:35.040
Because these men are surrogates,
there's a good chance his victims

20:35.040 --> 20:37.380
will never be able to give the UnSub
what he ultimately wants.

20:37.380 --> 20:40.290
Understanding his motivation
will be the key to finding him.

20:40.290 --> 20:41.380
Thank you.

21:00.080 --> 21:02.420
- -

21:04.380 --> 21:05.960
Drink. Drink.

21:08.460 --> 21:09.790
Drink. Drink.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.250
Why are you doing this?

21:16.920 --> 21:18.080
Where's the tattoo?

21:19.000 --> 21:20.460
I don't know what you're talking about.

21:20.460 --> 21:22.250
-Did you burn it off?
-I never had any tattoo.

21:28.710 --> 21:30.170
Please just let me go.

21:30.170 --> 21:31.420
I think you have the wrong person.

21:44.210 --> 21:45.790
You know why you're here.

21:45.790 --> 21:48.000
No, no, no, please don't do this!
Please don't do this!

21:48.000 --> 21:51.500
Please don't do this! No, no, no, no, no!

22:07.880 --> 22:10.460
Ballistics confirm
the gun used to kill Lance

22:10.460 --> 22:12.620
was the same one registered
to Steven Jackson.

22:17.330 --> 22:20.040
I've got men canvassing
gas stations, rest stops,

22:20.580 --> 22:21.880
-any place where the UnSub might have
-

22:21.880 --> 22:23.670
come into contact with the victims.

22:23.670 --> 22:26.000
So far, no solid leads.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.460
Hey, tell me something good, boo.

22:27.460 --> 22:29.000
I managed
to partially piece together

22:29.000 --> 22:31.420
Lance's GPS history,
and I've got him on a route

22:31.420 --> 22:33.080
that takes him right up Interstate 10.

22:33.080 --> 22:36.120
That's the exact same route
the first victim would have taken to work.

22:37.290 --> 22:38.880
Lance Coleman wouldn't
have been on that highway

22:38.880 --> 22:40.040
if he hadn't missed his flight.

22:40.040 --> 22:42.330
So this is where both
victims' paths crossed with the UnSub.

22:42.330 --> 22:43.750
This must be the nexus.

22:43.750 --> 22:46.120
I-10's one of the most
traveled roads in the country.

22:46.120 --> 22:48.120
It stretches from California to Florida.

22:48.120 --> 22:50.210
Highway serial killer's paradise.

22:50.210 --> 22:52.750
Garcia, run our profile
against the HSK database.

22:52.750 --> 22:56.250
Check for any potential
suspects connected specifically to I-10.

22:56.250 --> 22:58.170
-I'm on it.
-

22:58.170 --> 23:00.710
How much are you willing to bet
that whatever that UnSub is looking for

23:00.710 --> 23:02.080
is somehow connected to this highway?

23:12.250 --> 23:13.670
What do you want from me?

23:13.670 --> 23:15.460
I don't know what you think I did.

23:16.580 --> 23:18.920
I can help you. Just...
Just give me a chance.

23:24.670 --> 23:26.290
Unchain me! Now!

23:29.750 --> 23:30.960
Hey, come back here.

23:30.960 --> 23:32.790
I said stop!

24:02.120 --> 24:03.210
Caffeine.

24:03.460 --> 24:05.750
I am a fan. What about it?

24:05.750 --> 24:07.960
You want your victims
to stay awake and alert

24:07.960 --> 24:10.000
for what you're about to do to them.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.710
So you give them caffeine.

24:11.710 --> 24:14.460
Wow, astronomical levels, apparently.

24:14.460 --> 24:15.620
Wait, how did you...

24:15.960 --> 24:18.000
Oh. Yeah, sorry.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.710
Wait, why would he do this again?

24:19.710 --> 24:21.580
Well, there are a variety of reasons.

24:21.580 --> 24:23.710
The caffeine would open up their arteries,

24:23.710 --> 24:25.580
which would increase
their nerve sensitivity,

24:25.580 --> 24:27.290
and in turn, enhance their pain levels.

24:28.120 --> 24:29.500
Sleep deprivation.

24:30.620 --> 24:32.170
So the torture isn't about his anger,

24:32.170 --> 24:34.120
it's a reflection
of what he's going through.

24:34.120 --> 24:36.040
He wants them to stay awake.

24:53.170 --> 24:54.620
You will tell me where she is.

25:02.750 --> 25:04.420
No.

25:19.500 --> 25:21.620
We just received news
of another abduction.

25:23.960 --> 25:26.920
David Whitfield.
Reported missing an hour ago.

25:26.920 --> 25:29.880
30 yesterday morning.

25:29.880 --> 25:32.290
But according to his roommate,
he never made it back home.

25:32.290 --> 25:33.620
Where does he work?

25:33.620 --> 25:36.120
An old auto factory
off Interstate 10 near Canton.

25:36.120 --> 25:38.330
Fits the geographic profile
and the timeline.

25:38.330 --> 25:39.790
This guy has a precise MO.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.830
How much of the Interstate
is isolated enough for an abduction?

25:43.830 --> 25:46.880
A couple of gas stations,
a diner, and a few rest stops.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.170
Nothing really pops out.

25:48.170 --> 25:50.620
Not to mention, there are far more
secluded stretches of Interstate.

25:51.170 --> 25:53.330
Why does he keep coming back
to the same area?

26:27.620 --> 26:29.120
Play it again, Daddy.

26:29.120 --> 26:30.380
Again?

26:30.380 --> 26:32.880
We've been playing it
since we hit the road.

26:32.880 --> 26:34.460
Please

26:40.500 --> 26:41.670
Okay.

26:41.670 --> 26:43.210
Will you sing with me?

26:43.210 --> 26:45.710
No, honey, you know Daddy can't sing.

26:45.710 --> 26:48.750
You can try. Please

27:05.330 --> 27:07.920
Hey, Daddy. You're my sunshine.

27:20.460 --> 27:22.120
Hey, Mama, listen up.

27:22.120 --> 27:23.790
We need you to focus
on a particular stretch

27:23.790 --> 27:26.040
of Interstate 10
between Chandler and Phoenix.

27:26.040 --> 27:28.290
Look for any accidents
involving male drivers

27:28.290 --> 27:29.460
on that stretch of highway.

27:29.460 --> 27:30.620
-Keep it coming.
-

27:30.620 --> 27:32.290
We know the UnSub's
keeping his victims awake,

27:32.290 --> 27:35.040
so look for any accidents where
the drivers fell asleep at the wheel.

27:36.380 --> 27:38.380
Uh, okay, I am not finding

27:38.380 --> 27:40.790
any sleep-related
incidents within that radius.

27:40.790 --> 27:43.210
We know that the time of
abduction is important to him.

27:43.210 --> 27:47.960
30 and 2:00 a.m.

27:47.960 --> 27:51.830
Despite on the I-10, there's like
an accident every 45 seconds,

27:51.830 --> 27:53.790
-I've got zilch.
-Okay, we know this was

27:53.790 --> 27:55.620
a recent trigger,
so expand your search parameters

27:55.620 --> 27:57.830
to look at incidents
reported within the last few months.

28:02.830 --> 28:04.790
-Huh.
-What did you find?

28:04.790 --> 28:06.040
I don't know if I found anything.

28:06.040 --> 28:08.960
I found a report citing sleep deprivation,

28:08.960 --> 28:11.960
but it's not an accident,
it's a child abduction.

28:40.750 --> 28:41.920
Here we go.

28:41.920 --> 28:43.750
I managed to find the original
police report

28:43.750 --> 28:45.000
from three months ago.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.170
Okay, a 43-year-old William Taylor

28:48.170 --> 28:50.620
was driving I-10 near Chandler, Arizona.

28:52.420 --> 28:54.170
30.

28:55.620 --> 28:57.290
He was with his 5-year-old
daughter Tatiana.

28:57.290 --> 28:59.330
They were returning from a dance recital.

28:59.330 --> 29:01.880
It says here, he just worked
a double shift

29:01.880 --> 29:04.000
at the salvage yard which he owns.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.080
He was super sleepy.

29:05.080 --> 29:07.290
He pulled off around
midnight to a rest stop.

29:27.380 --> 29:29.080
He intended to close
his eyes for 10 minutes,

29:29.080 --> 29:30.960
he woke up hours later
and his daughter was missing.

29:31.250 --> 29:34.000
I can't imagine...
A parent's worst nightmare.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.170
There's your trigger.

29:35.170 --> 29:37.960
He's torturing them for answers
about his daughter's abduction.

29:37.960 --> 29:40.460
Yeah, in his mind,
he believes his victims were involved.

29:40.460 --> 29:42.170
Garcia, any viable suspects?

29:42.170 --> 29:45.250
Uh, no, the police canvassed
the whole rest stop,

29:45.250 --> 29:48.000
and they came up empty.
There's still no leads.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.580
- -

29:49.580 --> 29:50.710
Hold on.

29:51.420 --> 29:52.580
According to Taylor,

29:52.580 --> 29:54.670
there was a man
with a skull tattoo on his hand

29:54.670 --> 29:56.960
who knocked on his window
moments after he fell asleep.

29:59.670 --> 30:01.000
The guy told Taylor...

30:01.000 --> 30:02.750
I just wanted to let you know
your taillight is out.

30:03.960 --> 30:05.750
Thanks, thanks, thank you, thank you.

30:17.670 --> 30:19.380
Like you said,
Taylor might have been suffering

30:19.380 --> 30:21.250
from sleep deprivation himself.

30:21.250 --> 30:22.750
It's likely he was in a micro sleep

30:22.750 --> 30:24.670
and he imagined the man
with a skull tattoo.

30:24.670 --> 30:27.380
And like any parent would be,
the UnSub is riddled with guilt.

30:27.380 --> 30:30.250
And in his mind, he wasn't able to
protect her and keep her safe.

30:30.250 --> 30:31.670
And now in his delusional state,

30:31.670 --> 30:34.330
he believes each of his victims
is that man with the skull tattoo.

30:34.330 --> 30:38.000
He's forcing his victims
to take responsibility for his own guilt.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.670
If he hadn't fallen asleep
at that rest stop,

30:39.670 --> 30:41.210
his daughter might still be with him.

30:41.210 --> 30:42.670
So he forces his victims to stay awake

30:42.670 --> 30:44.330
as he wishes he had.

30:44.330 --> 30:45.960
Work and home address just sent.

30:45.960 --> 30:47.420
I'll let Hotch know.

31:26.790 --> 31:27.960
-Where's my daughter?
-I don't know!

31:27.960 --> 31:29.670
-Tell me!
-No, no!

32:26.500 --> 32:28.040
Hey.

32:28.040 --> 32:29.460
Where's your head at right now?

32:29.460 --> 32:32.710
I just don't understand
what happened a week ago

32:32.710 --> 32:35.120
that turned
a grieving father into a killer.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.710
It could have
been the stress from the case.

32:37.710 --> 32:39.790
All the leads went cold
and the guy just snapped.

32:39.790 --> 32:41.830
And the not knowing's the worst part.

32:43.710 --> 32:45.040
Hotch, you're on speaker.

32:45.040 --> 32:46.460
There's something you should know...

32:46.460 --> 32:47.830
The police found Tatiana's body.

33:15.250 --> 33:18.250
Please, don't do this, I'm begging you!

33:18.250 --> 33:19.460
Where's my daughter?
-No.

33:27.420 --> 33:30.500
William Taylor, step out of the vehicle
with your hands where we can see them.

33:30.500 --> 33:32.290
I got him.
That's the man with the skull tattoo.

33:32.290 --> 33:33.460
He's right there.

33:33.460 --> 33:34.750
That is not him, William.

33:34.750 --> 33:36.500
Damn it, why aren't you listening to me?

33:36.500 --> 33:37.920
That man has my daughter!

33:37.920 --> 33:40.290
-No, he doesn't.
-Yes, he does.

33:40.290 --> 33:41.500
And I'm going to find her

33:41.500 --> 33:43.040
and I'm not going to let him
get away with it again.

33:43.040 --> 33:46.040
All right, William,
William, listen to me, okay?

33:46.040 --> 33:49.500
You and I both know they found Tatiana.

33:54.710 --> 33:56.120
You found my little girl?

33:56.120 --> 33:59.210
Yes, a week ago. William, you were there.

34:01.670 --> 34:03.380
I don't know what you're talking about.

34:03.380 --> 34:06.000
You remember the volunteers,
the search party?

34:24.080 --> 34:25.460
William, think back.

35:17.880 --> 35:21.290
Tatiana's remains were found in the desert
not far from the rest stop.

35:23.880 --> 35:26.460
No, no, no, no. That was not her.

35:26.830 --> 35:28.080
She's still out there.

35:30.080 --> 35:31.750
Think about Tatiana, William.

35:31.750 --> 35:33.170
Think about what she would have wanted.

35:46.960 --> 35:48.960
Hey, Daddy, you're my sunshine.

35:55.080 --> 35:56.420
She's alive, and I'm going to find her.

36:42.210 --> 36:45.620
"Guilt is perhaps the most
painful companion of death."

36:45.620 --> 36:46.830
Coco Chanel.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.540
Oh, sorry.

36:55.540 --> 36:58.000
Wow. Kids really
are game-changers, aren't they?

36:58.000 --> 36:59.540
Yeah, how is it that I wake up

36:59.540 --> 37:01.380
more exhausted than
when I went to bed?

37:02.210 --> 37:04.380
Why don't you try
to get some shut-eye before we land?

37:04.380 --> 37:06.790
Oh, trust me, I've tried,
it's not happening.

37:08.670 --> 37:10.540
Hey, Rossi.

37:10.540 --> 37:13.210
I remember Reid told me once, uh,

37:13.210 --> 37:14.670
I think it was something like this...

37:15.460 --> 37:16.750
Hey, Morgan,

37:16.750 --> 37:20.500
you know electronics
emit a sleep depriving type of blue light

37:20.500 --> 37:22.170
that prevents you from
falling asleep at night.

37:24.170 --> 37:25.920
Yeah, I remember that.

37:25.920 --> 37:27.670
I actually think it was more like, um...

37:27.670 --> 37:29.040
Well, studies show

37:29.040 --> 37:32.500
that we need between
seven and nine hours of sleep a night.

37:40.500 --> 37:41.960
Works like a charm.

37:49.040 --> 37:50.290
Hotch...

37:53.000 --> 37:54.580
What do you think happened
to William's daughter?

37:57.830 --> 37:59.120
Well, the police report assumed

37:59.120 --> 38:01.170
that because he didn't have
child locks on his truck,

38:01.170 --> 38:03.500
that she wandered off
into the desert for some reason.

38:03.500 --> 38:05.210
You know, I saw where they found the body.

38:05.210 --> 38:07.500
There's no way she could have found
her way back to the road.

38:07.500 --> 38:09.380
Well, the way the temperatures
drop in the desert at night,

38:09.380 --> 38:10.540
she didn't stand a chance.

38:12.580 --> 38:14.580
Yeah, but, Hotch,
you should have seen this guy.

38:14.580 --> 38:15.790
I mean, up until the very end,

38:15.790 --> 38:17.670
he was adamant
that a guy with a skull tattoo

38:17.670 --> 38:19.080
abducted his daughter.

38:19.080 --> 38:21.420
Well, the UnSub with a ghost
in his mind is always dangerous.

38:23.580 --> 38:25.620
Unless it wasn't all in his mind.

38:29.540 --> 38:34.380
JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI

38:45.000 --> 38:48.120
Ugh, it's really coming down.

38:54.330 --> 38:57.210
Haven't you had enough of that thing?

38:57.210 --> 39:00.960
You know, once we get to grandma's house,
she's going to make you put it away.

39:01.540 --> 39:02.580
Uh-huh.

39:13.620 --> 39:15.830
Well, you better save
some of that battery.

39:15.830 --> 39:19.620
According to the GPS, we have another
two hours ahead of us.

39:28.210 --> 39:29.670
I think we should wait out
the storm until...

39:34.170 --> 39:35.420
Didn't mean to startle.

39:35.420 --> 39:37.500
Just wanted to let you know
your taillight is out.

39:37.500 --> 39:38.670
It is?

39:38.670 --> 39:41.290
Yeah, I was driving behind you
back on the Interstate.

39:41.290 --> 39:42.420
Saw you pull over at the rest stop,

39:42.420 --> 39:43.790
figured I'd give you the heads up.

39:46.460 --> 39:48.170
I appreciate it. Thank you.

39:49.380 --> 39:51.080
You have a good night, ma'am.
