00:01.583 --> 00:02.958
[Narrator]
Previously on X-Men...

00:02.958 --> 00:04.458
Wolverine, you know
this madman?

00:05.000 --> 00:06.833
[Wolverine]
I tangled with Omega Red

00:06.833 --> 00:08.375
before either of you were born.

00:08.750 --> 00:10.125
The Soviets created him.

00:10.625 --> 00:12.708
Red's got his own plans
for this country,

00:13.125 --> 00:15.250
and worst of all,
nothing hurts him.

00:15.250 --> 00:16.708
[Colossus]
You defeated him!

00:16.708 --> 00:18.291
I got lucky.

00:18.291 --> 00:21.000
The deepest cold
held Omega Red prisoner.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.208
Perhaps it can still stop him.

00:23.208 --> 00:26.000
No, not again.

00:26.708 --> 00:29.250
For another lifetime.

00:29.250 --> 00:30.583
Freeze!

00:30.583 --> 00:32.583
[grunting]

00:35.750 --> 00:37.083
[theme music playing]

01:37.958 --> 01:40.125
Colonel, I think I found it!

01:40.750 --> 01:42.375
Sir, come quickly!

01:50.083 --> 01:52.000
-Help me get it out!
-Careful!

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
You don't know
what you're dealing with.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.875
But the guy's an ice cube, sir.

01:55.875 --> 01:57.875
You'll do what you're told,
soldier.

01:57.875 --> 01:59.583
Last time this thing
thawed out,

01:59.583 --> 02:02.083
he tore a small country
in half in less than a week.

02:02.083 --> 02:03.958
Now get the restraints!

02:03.958 --> 02:06.750
We're not gonna make
the same mistakes
the Soviets did.

02:06.750 --> 02:09.708
This living weapon
has a job to do.

02:14.750 --> 02:15.750
[Colonel]
How do you feel?

02:16.458 --> 02:17.875
We know you can hear us.

02:18.833 --> 02:20.375
We wish to make you an offer.

02:20.375 --> 02:24.458
I do not make deals
with imperialists.

02:24.458 --> 02:27.458
I was created
to fight your kind.

02:27.458 --> 02:29.750
That war is over. We won.

02:30.250 --> 02:33.250
But you have unique knowledge
and abilities that we need.

02:33.625 --> 02:36.375
Why should I help you?

02:36.375 --> 02:38.250
Because we can give you
something in return

02:38.250 --> 02:40.000
that I think
you'll find intriguing.

02:40.458 --> 02:42.083
What could that be?

02:42.083 --> 02:45.583
We will make you
human once again.

02:45.583 --> 02:47.125
Do not mock me!

02:47.125 --> 02:48.375
It cannot be done!

02:48.750 --> 02:51.125
Medical science
has progressed a great deal

02:51.125 --> 02:53.125
since you were altered.

02:53.125 --> 02:55.583
You wish what from me?

02:55.583 --> 02:56.583
[beeping]

02:57.333 --> 02:58.958
[Colonel]
Your help in cleaning up a mess

02:58.958 --> 03:00.375
left by your government.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.250
A Sovietnuclear submarine
was abandoned in deep water

03:04.250 --> 03:07.833
near Hilo, Hawaii, about
120 miles from Pearl Harbor.

03:07.833 --> 03:09.625
We need you
to bring it up for us.

03:10.083 --> 03:12.458
Its position is unstable.
As you can imagine,

03:12.458 --> 03:14.875
its reactor
and warheads concern us.

03:15.333 --> 03:19.208
You can survive any radioactive
toxicity found inside.

03:19.208 --> 03:21.125
You know
the Soviet security codes,

03:21.583 --> 03:24.125
some of which
have been misplaced

03:24.125 --> 03:27.208
in your country's
recent chaotic evolution.

03:27.208 --> 03:29.708
Why would you trust me to help?

03:29.708 --> 03:31.250
We don't.

03:31.250 --> 03:33.625
You have been implanted
with a sealed vial

03:33.625 --> 03:35.208
of liquid nitrogen.

03:35.208 --> 03:38.125
Betray us,
and you shall regret it.

03:38.708 --> 03:41.708
I like dealing
with serious people.

03:41.708 --> 03:44.458
Your terms are satisfactory,

03:45.000 --> 03:47.583
with one small addition.

03:48.333 --> 03:50.875
-Name it.
-You have your insurance,

03:50.875 --> 03:52.958
I would like some as well.

03:52.958 --> 03:55.958
I require two shipmates
to accompany me.

03:56.583 --> 03:58.583
Old friends of mine.

03:58.583 --> 03:59.875
Their names are

03:59.875 --> 04:02.625
Wolverine and Storm.

04:05.875 --> 04:09.083
[Wolverine]
Somebody wake me up
from this nightmare,

04:09.083 --> 04:11.333
'cause I've got to be dreaming.

04:11.333 --> 04:14.125
Who do these genius
spy-catchers think
they're dealing with?

04:14.583 --> 04:16.208
Winnie the Pooh?

04:16.208 --> 04:18.750
They are
fully aware, Wolverine.

04:18.750 --> 04:20.750
They also realize
what could happen

04:20.750 --> 04:22.750
if that
submarine's reactor core

04:22.750 --> 04:24.125
were to split open.

04:24.125 --> 04:25.833
The liquid nitrogen implant

04:25.833 --> 04:27.750
seems a reasonable precaution.

04:27.750 --> 04:29.375
For a Boy Scout!

04:29.375 --> 04:31.750
Omega Red eats the stuff
for breakfast.

04:31.750 --> 04:34.458
Would you prefer it
if I took your place

04:34.458 --> 04:35.875
as Omega's hostage?

04:35.875 --> 04:38.083
What, and miss all the fun?

04:38.083 --> 04:39.500
Not a chance.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.500
I know he's gonna
pull something.

04:41.500 --> 04:44.250
And when he does,
I'm gonna be ready.

04:49.458 --> 04:51.000
[Colonel]
I want to thank you all

04:51.000 --> 04:53.500
for agreeing to join
our salvage effort.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.208
We all know what's at stake.

04:55.208 --> 04:57.458
You don't have a clue, bub.

04:57.458 --> 04:59.750
Speak when you're spoken to,
mister!

04:59.750 --> 05:01.875
You come a step closer, pal,

05:01.875 --> 05:04.000
and you're gonna eat that hand.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.458
Do not worry, Colonel.

05:06.250 --> 05:09.291
I did not expect
old wounds to heal easily,

05:09.291 --> 05:10.958
even for Wolverine.

05:10.958 --> 05:13.250
It is a great irony, no,

05:13.250 --> 05:15.958
a man whose body
is able to heal itself,

05:16.375 --> 05:18.500
but whose spirit never can.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.375
-I knew it.
-Wolverine, no!

05:21.000 --> 05:23.416
Cut the phony philosophy.

05:23.416 --> 05:24.500
Let's just do it.

05:44.708 --> 05:48.291
What fairy tale
did you tell them
to make them trust you?

05:48.291 --> 05:50.500
Does it look
like they trust me?

05:50.500 --> 05:52.333
[growling]

05:52.333 --> 05:54.333
Control your anger, Wolverine.

05:54.333 --> 05:56.708
A fight would surely breach
the hull.

05:56.708 --> 05:59.458
At these depths,
none of us would survive.

05:59.458 --> 06:00.875
Do not worry, Storm.

06:00.875 --> 06:02.708
Life is precious to me.

06:02.708 --> 06:04.458
At least my own life,

06:04.458 --> 06:06.875
which this mission
shall return to me.

06:06.875 --> 06:10.250
I have been promised
my humanity, Wolverine,

06:10.250 --> 06:12.500
something you above all others

06:12.500 --> 06:14.416
should be able to appreciate.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.416
It can't be done.

06:17.416 --> 06:20.208
Please, Logan,
control yourself.

06:20.208 --> 06:22.750
You know small spaces
overwhelm me.

06:22.750 --> 06:25.708
You must stay clear-headed
if we are to survive.

06:28.833 --> 06:29.875
I see it!

06:32.583 --> 06:35.291
Mission control,
this is the mini-sub Chios.

06:35.291 --> 06:37.583
[Colonel]
This is mission control.
Read you, Chios.

06:37.583 --> 06:39.750
Target in visual range.

06:39.750 --> 06:41.125
We see it, Chios.

06:41.125 --> 06:43.333
Remember, dock gently.

06:43.333 --> 06:45.458
That ledge could
give way at any time.

06:45.458 --> 06:47.708
We understand, mission control.

06:47.708 --> 06:48.708
[beeping]

06:53.166 --> 06:54.250
[Wolverine]
Easy does it, Storm.

06:55.250 --> 06:57.625
If those
Soviet wise guys built subs

06:57.625 --> 06:58.875
like they built Chernobyl,

06:59.333 --> 07:00.500
I don't want to give this one

07:00.500 --> 07:02.500
any reason to lose its cool.

07:12.750 --> 07:14.250
-Hey!
-I am sorry.

07:17.375 --> 07:20.000
-[alarms blaring]
-These controls
are rather vague.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.583
[Omega Red]
Russian saying states,

07:22.083 --> 07:24.333
"Any landing
you can walk away from

07:24.333 --> 07:25.708
is good landing."

07:25.708 --> 07:26.750
[laughs]

07:26.750 --> 07:27.875
We don't.

07:28.375 --> 07:29.416
[beeping]

07:35.333 --> 07:36.500
[Wolverine growling]

07:37.416 --> 07:38.875
All right, Chios,
let's move it.

07:39.583 --> 07:41.708
After you, comrade.

07:45.750 --> 07:47.291
[creaking]

07:57.875 --> 08:00.458
[Wolverine]
An island vacation,
with Omega Red,

08:00.458 --> 08:02.708
in a toxic nuclear powder keg,

08:02.708 --> 08:04.625
three miles underwater.

08:04.625 --> 08:07.208
Yeah, this is
pretty much Shangri-la.

08:08.458 --> 08:11.875
-We are inside,
mission control.
-Yeah.

08:11.875 --> 08:14.416
[Colonel]
Omega Red, systems status.

08:14.416 --> 08:15.750
One moment!

08:15.750 --> 08:18.083
Americans, always so impatient!

08:22.708 --> 08:24.000
Well, what do you know.

08:24.708 --> 08:25.875
They ought to use this tub

08:25.875 --> 08:27.208
in one of those battery ads

08:27.208 --> 08:28.291
with the rabbit.

08:28.291 --> 08:30.000
Control rods withdrawn.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.750
All systems operational.

08:33.083 --> 08:34.208
Engage props!

08:37.250 --> 08:38.583
[Wolverine exclaiming]

08:40.375 --> 08:42.083
-[Storm screaming]
-[Colonel]]What's wrong
down there?

08:48.208 --> 08:49.458
Nothing, Colonel.

08:49.875 --> 08:51.750
Just getting our sea legs back.

08:52.208 --> 08:55.416
So let's find a place
to park this thing
and get out of here!

08:55.416 --> 08:56.833
[Colonel]
Good work!

08:56.833 --> 08:58.583
Now let's bring her home.

08:58.583 --> 09:00.500
Oh, now, Colonel,

09:00.500 --> 09:02.166
that hardly seems fair.

09:02.166 --> 09:03.875
[Colonel]
Don't play with me, mister.

09:03.875 --> 09:06.416
You know we can
take you out in a second.

09:06.416 --> 09:08.875
Yes, something about giving me

09:08.875 --> 09:10.000
the big chill

09:10.708 --> 09:13.500
by activating an implant.

09:13.500 --> 09:16.333
How foolish of me to forget.

09:16.333 --> 09:17.708
I knew it!

09:20.833 --> 09:21.875
No!

09:22.708 --> 09:25.250
[growling]
Let me go, Storm!

09:25.250 --> 09:28.000
This guy's playing
the whole world for fools!

09:28.000 --> 09:29.875
You do not understand!

09:29.875 --> 09:31.583
Yes, Logan.

09:31.583 --> 09:34.875
You forget the air
inside this vessel is toxic.

09:34.875 --> 09:37.583
For you, but not for me.

09:37.583 --> 09:41.166
He need only tear these suits
to stop us both!

09:41.166 --> 09:43.583
Your healing powers
would eventually help you.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.166
You might survive.

09:45.166 --> 09:46.625
I would not.

09:47.083 --> 09:49.833
-[beeping]
-Get me the US Naval Command
at Pearl.

09:50.291 --> 09:52.000
We have a situation! Code Red!

09:52.708 --> 09:54.750
[Wolverine]
All right, what do you want?

09:56.166 --> 09:58.750
[Omega Red]
How kind of you
to ask, Comrade.

09:58.750 --> 10:01.125
But you have been
so generous already.

10:01.125 --> 10:03.750
My own submarine, missiles

10:03.750 --> 10:06.500
and the two who froze me,

10:06.500 --> 10:08.416
powerless to resist.

10:08.416 --> 10:11.375
I don't care if my lungs melt!

10:11.375 --> 10:12.375
[grunting]

10:12.375 --> 10:14.208
I'm stopping this guy!

10:14.208 --> 10:15.375
[Wolverine roaring]

10:15.375 --> 10:16.583
[Omega Red screams]

10:17.833 --> 10:18.833
[grunting]

10:22.333 --> 10:25.166
Wind! Repel him!

10:33.583 --> 10:34.583
Logan!

10:35.250 --> 10:36.333
[Wolverine coughing]

10:36.750 --> 10:40.083
What was I saying about
not needing these lungs?

10:40.083 --> 10:42.250
I shall get us to the mini-sub!

10:46.250 --> 10:47.750
[Storm panting]

10:47.750 --> 10:50.416
We are almost there!

10:51.208 --> 10:52.291
[screaming]

10:53.333 --> 10:56.291
Enough! You wish my terms?

10:56.291 --> 10:58.416
You, who would offer
a living weapon

10:58.416 --> 11:01.166
something as pitiful
as his humanity?

11:01.166 --> 11:03.208
I haveprogrammed
the missiles,

11:03.208 --> 11:04.583
one directed at each

11:04.583 --> 11:07.208
of the world's
15 largest cities.

11:07.208 --> 11:10.166
And what I want, Colonel,

11:10.833 --> 11:13.583
is to watch them burn!

11:16.708 --> 11:18.583
[Beast]
Like vilified Cassandra,

11:18.583 --> 11:21.708
we all may pay a price
for Wolverine's foresight.

11:21.708 --> 11:23.708
The craft is rising steadily,

11:23.708 --> 11:26.250
but it is still far too deep
for us to engage.

11:26.250 --> 11:27.250
[Xavier]
Stay with them!

11:27.708 --> 11:29.708
Navy planes, submarines
and surface ships

11:29.708 --> 11:31.166
are all on the way!

11:31.166 --> 11:33.125
Have you armed
the depth charges?

11:33.125 --> 11:34.625
Armed and ready for deployment.

11:36.208 --> 11:37.875
Can't you boys figure out

11:37.875 --> 11:39.375
a better way
to deal with that octopus

11:39.375 --> 11:41.291
than beating up Storm
and Logan?

11:41.291 --> 11:43.750
It is only
a last resort, Rogue.

11:43.750 --> 11:46.875
But given the fact that
Omega Red has nuclear missiles,

11:46.875 --> 11:50.250
it must remain an option
until the Navy gets there.

11:50.250 --> 11:53.125
It is our understanding
that the Soviet
submersible vehicle

11:53.125 --> 11:55.583
must rise to a far
shallower depth

11:55.583 --> 11:57.583
to successfully
launch its missiles.

11:57.583 --> 11:59.125
If we can disable it,

11:59.125 --> 12:00.375
perhaps the Navy will find

12:00.375 --> 12:01.875
a less deadly alternative.

12:06.625 --> 12:08.166
[Colonel]
What do you mean ten minutes?

12:08.166 --> 12:10.416
He could be
at launch depth in five!

12:10.416 --> 12:13.625
Colonel, your target
is 120 miles from Pearl,

12:13.625 --> 12:16.166
and sub-chaser aircraft
are just not that quick.

12:16.166 --> 12:18.458
My F-18s will get there faster,
but they're not much good

12:18.458 --> 12:19.833
unless the sub surfaces.

12:19.833 --> 12:21.708
If your agency had warned us,

12:21.708 --> 12:23.250
we would have been
better prepared.

12:27.375 --> 12:30.625
My country created
many great weapons,

12:30.625 --> 12:33.500
but never had the will
to use them.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.708
Is it not
a great sadness, Storm,

12:35.708 --> 12:37.958
to be created never to be used?

12:38.375 --> 12:41.000
Weapons do not have feelings.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.833
Oh, if only that were true.

12:43.833 --> 12:45.750
Soon every ship and plane

12:45.750 --> 12:48.291
within 1,000 miles
will be bearing down on us.

12:48.833 --> 12:51.583
Are you so tired of life?

12:51.583 --> 12:53.083
On the contrary,

12:53.083 --> 12:55.375
only someone denied life
as I was,

12:55.375 --> 12:57.458
for over a quarter
of a century,

12:57.458 --> 12:59.708
can appreciate it
quite so well.

12:59.708 --> 13:02.083
I will launch
my missiles and return

13:02.083 --> 13:03.458
to the depths of the ocean

13:03.458 --> 13:05.416
before any force
can reach me.

13:06.083 --> 13:08.375
The world will tumble
into chaos

13:08.375 --> 13:11.708
and I can choose
my time to emerge,

13:11.708 --> 13:13.708
ready to pick up the pieces.

13:18.416 --> 13:19.500
[all shouting]

13:19.500 --> 13:21.333
[computer beeping]

13:22.291 --> 13:23.875
Who can be up there so soon?

13:23.875 --> 13:25.250
[beeping]

13:25.750 --> 13:27.208
What was that?

13:27.208 --> 13:28.875
It registered as
a depth charge, sir.

13:28.875 --> 13:31.000
I know that, sailor,
but from where?

13:31.000 --> 13:32.208
An angry cloud?

13:32.208 --> 13:33.208
Radar shows no planes

13:33.208 --> 13:34.583
or ships in the area.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.625
[Officer]
Confirmed, sir.
Could be a stealth craft.

13:37.625 --> 13:40.291
Sounds like that got
the old boy's attention.

13:40.291 --> 13:41.875
I believe that Omega Red

13:41.875 --> 13:44.250
forgot that Wolverine
and Storm's microphones

13:44.250 --> 13:45.750
are still operative.

13:45.750 --> 13:47.166
[Omega Red]
No anti-submarine plane

13:47.166 --> 13:48.583
could have arrived so quickly!

13:49.166 --> 13:51.500
[Beast]
I doubt our nudging
will delay Omega Red

13:51.500 --> 13:53.458
from reaching
missile launch depth.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.708
[Omega Red]
In a moment,
the fireworks shall begin.

13:57.708 --> 14:01.166
Now, a moment
to level out,

14:01.166 --> 14:03.250
and we can begin!

14:03.250 --> 14:05.291
-[beeping]
-Launch depth.

14:16.083 --> 14:17.083
[beeping]

14:25.083 --> 14:26.083
[Storm groaning]

14:29.166 --> 14:30.166
[exclaiming]

14:32.458 --> 14:34.833
It will do them no good!

14:34.833 --> 14:36.958
Lightning strike!

14:36.958 --> 14:38.333
[grunting]

14:38.333 --> 14:40.291
If you can't stop him,
at least prepare

14:40.291 --> 14:41.708
to take out the missiles!

14:41.708 --> 14:43.708
[Officer]
My F-18s will arrive soon, sir.

14:43.708 --> 14:45.416
They can take out
the sub's missiles.

14:45.416 --> 14:46.875
But there is
the possible problem

14:46.875 --> 14:49.083
-of warhead override.
-Explain!

14:49.083 --> 14:50.458
[Officer]
Normally, warheads don't arm

14:50.458 --> 14:51.833
until they're near
their targets.

14:51.833 --> 14:53.416
But sir, if this maniac

14:53.416 --> 14:55.708
can reprogram
their arming sequence,

14:55.708 --> 14:57.166
they could come out hot.

14:57.708 --> 14:59.458
[Beast]
Our instruments
indicate Omega Red

14:59.458 --> 15:01.125
has reached launch depth.

15:01.125 --> 15:02.125
Any suggestions?

15:02.500 --> 15:04.416
Damage himas much as you can

15:04.416 --> 15:06.000
with depth charges.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.166
The Navy will arrive soon
to help.

15:08.166 --> 15:10.583
But if he starts launching,

15:10.583 --> 15:13.166
you must do everything
in your power

15:13.166 --> 15:15.083
to stop the missiles.

15:15.083 --> 15:17.250
No matter what the cost.

15:19.833 --> 15:22.500
Say goodbye to
the world you knew!

15:23.875 --> 15:25.208
[Storm]
You cannot launch!

15:26.083 --> 15:27.625
Millions shall perish!

15:27.625 --> 15:29.166
As they must,

15:29.166 --> 15:31.708
so that millions more
shall fear me.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.291
There's been a launch!

15:35.291 --> 15:37.250
Where are those F-18s?

15:37.250 --> 15:38.250
[Officer]
On their way, sir!

15:39.833 --> 15:41.083
Still a minute out of range.

15:54.208 --> 15:55.833
[Beast]
We are in luck

15:55.833 --> 15:57.458
and still alive.

15:57.458 --> 16:00.000
The warheads
are in standard pre-armed mode.

16:02.208 --> 16:05.416
Hang on, Hank.
We got four birds left
in this turkey shoot.

16:08.291 --> 16:09.750
My missiles!

16:09.750 --> 16:12.375
Sailor, I don't register
your F-18s yet!

16:12.375 --> 16:14.250
Who's knocking
out these missiles?

16:14.250 --> 16:15.333
[Officer]
Don't know, sir.

16:25.250 --> 16:27.583
[Beast]
The missiles' acceleration rate
is incredible.

16:28.125 --> 16:29.458
I estimate five seconds

16:29.458 --> 16:31.458
until the fifth one
is out of range.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.125
Just get me a chance.

16:33.708 --> 16:34.708
[beeping]

16:37.208 --> 16:38.458
[Beast]
Oh, dear.

16:38.458 --> 16:39.500
Now what?

16:40.291 --> 16:42.250
There is no way Navy planes

16:42.250 --> 16:43.875
could have arrived so fast.

16:43.875 --> 16:46.250
Someone was lying in wait!

16:46.875 --> 16:49.625
It's you X-Men! I know it!

16:50.250 --> 16:52.375
[computer beeping]

16:52.375 --> 16:54.458
No, impossible!

16:59.333 --> 17:00.875
Looks like those Navy boys

17:00.875 --> 17:02.583
decided to get off
their backsides

17:02.583 --> 17:04.083
and join the party.

17:04.083 --> 17:05.625
To paraphrase Cowper,

17:06.083 --> 17:08.458
"They delivered us
when bound and when bleeding,

17:08.458 --> 17:11.000
healed our wounds
sought us wandering,

17:11.000 --> 17:14.333
set us right,
turned our darkness into light"

17:14.333 --> 17:16.958
I was made a living weapon.

17:17.750 --> 17:21.333
They cannot deny me!

17:22.250 --> 17:23.375
The warheads.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.166
Hear me!

17:28.625 --> 17:31.375
Navy frequency
originating from the submarine.

17:32.083 --> 17:34.500
[Omega Red]
Fire upon the missiles again

17:34.500 --> 17:36.833
and the Hawaiian coastal cities

17:36.833 --> 17:38.458
shall be a memory.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.583
The warheads are armed.

17:41.583 --> 17:44.291
Let them try to stop me now.

17:44.291 --> 17:45.416
That does it.

17:47.375 --> 17:48.500
What do you propose?

17:50.333 --> 17:51.750
I'm going fishing.

17:51.750 --> 17:53.000
Rogue! Wait!

17:53.000 --> 17:54.708
Even now it is too far down.

17:54.708 --> 17:55.708
You cannot make it!

17:57.833 --> 18:00.000
[Omega Red laughing]

18:02.458 --> 18:04.875
I have no more use

18:04.875 --> 18:06.500
for hostages.

18:09.958 --> 18:11.291
[both screaming]

18:15.958 --> 18:17.458
[alarm beeping]

18:18.375 --> 18:20.333
Come on, Wolverine!

18:20.333 --> 18:21.750
Let us get out of here.

18:38.333 --> 18:41.083
It does not matter!
The missiles shall launch.

18:42.875 --> 18:44.208
[gasping]

18:44.208 --> 18:45.333
[coughing]

18:45.333 --> 18:47.000
Rogue? What is happening?

18:47.625 --> 18:48.875
I bent his boat.

18:54.833 --> 18:55.875
[coughing]

18:56.583 --> 18:57.583
[Wolverine]
Where is he?

18:58.083 --> 19:00.208
Something
attacked the submarine.

19:00.208 --> 19:01.458
It is listing.

19:01.458 --> 19:02.583
I do not believe

19:02.583 --> 19:04.458
it can launch more missiles.

19:05.708 --> 19:07.125
Is he still alive?

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Perhaps.

19:12.458 --> 19:14.583
But we are going home.

19:34.166 --> 19:35.208
What?

19:40.250 --> 19:42.708
[screaming]
No! No!

19:45.458 --> 19:47.583
[Beast]
Though the immediate threat
has passed,

19:47.583 --> 19:49.708
I fear much remains unresolved.

19:50.125 --> 19:52.833
Storm's claustrophobic trauma
will pass.

19:52.833 --> 19:55.000
I am more concerned
about Logan.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.583
His feelings about Omega Red
are more personal.

19:57.583 --> 19:59.000
More deeply rooted.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.250
I'm sure he feels
he could've done more.

20:01.708 --> 20:02.708
He's out there.

20:03.583 --> 20:05.166
I can smell him.
