01:03.047 --> 01:04.537
Ok, let's finish Luo!

01:04.849 --> 01:07.451
clam! Five minutes, please.

01:07.451 --> 01:09.353
Come on, mom, five minutes.

01:09.353 --> 01:11.218
Ok, then five minutes.

01:20.164 --> 01:23.759
Do not move!

01:31.942 --> 01:36.208
Fast rolling, bastard

01:37.682 --> 01:39.206
I want to kill you.

02:42.379 --> 02:44.540
lay down your weapon! lay down!

02:45.216 --> 02:46.615
Call you to lay down your weapon!

02:48.052 --> 02:49.644
Ok, don't move!

04:16.707 --> 04:17.675
Boss, okay?

04:17.675 --> 04:20.144
Rely, my wrist seems to twist

04:20.144 --> 04:22.977
- Stop it
- Just kidding... stupid!

04:24.682 --> 04:27.742
Wow, is that really the case?

04:28.385 --> 04:31.445
I am not sure about the brand of the car...

04:31.789 --> 04:33.984
But the other is almost like this

04:38.195 --> 04:39.025
All right

04:48.839 --> 04:50.431
It’s time to sleep now, my little Thai

04:51.742 --> 04:53.710
Dad is so strong!

04:55.412 --> 04:56.436
Like a lion
twenty one
00:05:03,354 --> 00:05:06,619
He never let us down, never wavered
twenty two
00:05:07,258 --> 00:05:10,489
(Chinese title: old love to find 碴)
For these reasons
twenty three
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:13,898
City Council unanimously passed, starting today
twenty four
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:16,765
This old fisherman's square

05:17.434 --> 05:20.130
With this one

05:20.271 --> 05:22.466
Honesty, courage and efficiency

05:22.606 --> 05:29.068
Guarding the city for fourteen years

05:29.179 --> 05:32.149
And named the hero who died in the city.

05:32.149 --> 05:34.852
That is great, heroic

05:34.852 --> 05:38.117
Mr. Shang Santi, who is always young

05:44.561 --> 05:48.691
At the same time, attending with us today

05:49.300 --> 05:53.168
As his colleague and friend

05:53.938 --> 05:59.176
Later became a fiancee, wife

05:59.176 --> 06:00.878
Child's mother...

06:00.878 --> 06:03.346
And his will

06:05.149 --> 06:07.952
One is still brave today

06:07.952 --> 06:11.655
The station at the Wahos Police Station...

06:11.655 --> 06:14.681
Captain Ivana Santi

06:31.342 --> 06:34.072
We often walk here with Shang

06:34.778 --> 06:37.679
Have a drink and eat oysters in an open-air restaurant

06:38.949 --> 06:41.509
Still love life and his work

06:42.219 --> 06:47.623
He wants to keep the possibility of happiness and calm

06:48.325 --> 06:52.489
I have been very happy and calm with him for ten years.

06:59.069 --> 07:00.502
I am very touched

07:01.505 --> 07:02.972
Sorry…

07:07.945 --> 07:09.606
The statue is really messy...

07:10.047 --> 07:11.882
Not like a body, the nose is not like...

07:11.882 --> 07:15.352
The shoulders are not like... nothing like it, scary people

07:15.352 --> 07:16.580
His gun is very similar

07:18.088 --> 07:19.783
Then drunk in front of Tai Europe...

07:20.491 --> 07:21.788
You are drunk in front of everyone...

07:22.192 --> 07:23.284
By the way, so obvious?

07:24.294 --> 07:25.261
Not at all obvious

07:28.632 --> 07:29.462
You are so nice, Louis.

07:30.167 --> 07:31.301
Why are you saying this?

07:31.301 --> 07:33.337
Because you lied to be seen through

07:33.337 --> 07:35.862
- You will take a deep breath and then suffocate
- Where can I?

07:37.508 --> 07:39.772
Yes, very touching

07:40.477 --> 07:41.645
As if I want to disappear from the world...

07:41.645 --> 07:43.514
Ok, I can see that everyone can see it.

07:43.514 --> 07:44.640
Even if you sit in the last row, you can see it.

07:47.184 --> 07:49.243
I am no longer determined, Louis

07:50.154 --> 07:51.555
Without him, I became stupid...

07:51.555 --> 07:52.856
I can't make my own decisions

07:52.856 --> 07:54.858
I don't know what to do and what to say.

07:54.858 --> 07:56.758
Life is slow, I am no longer bold

07:57.461 --> 08:00.919
Even in the supermarket, picking Youge will pick an hour.

08:02.232 --> 08:04.097
Would you like to add the beneficial bacteria, or did you add them?

08:04.368 --> 08:06.029
The weasel calls the monkey, mom, where are you?

08:06.970 --> 08:09.239
- Monkey received
- They gather earlier than expected

08:09.239 --> 08:11.175
- Who is there?
- It’s all coming.

08:11.175 --> 08:12.509
We have arrived at their nest

08:12.509 --> 08:13.877
We are waiting for you to come back.

08:13.877 --> 08:15.777
- Come on, get started.
- Five minutes, I am as soon as possible

08:16.747 --> 08:20.818
No. 17-47, please go to the Charlie Hotel...

08:20.818 --> 08:22.453
I am taking you to the bus stop, you can take the number 30 directly.

08:22.453 --> 08:24.421
- Where are you going?
- Have a personal abuse club

08:24.421 --> 08:25.388
Have underage, drugs...

08:27.524 --> 08:28.826
Rely, Louis, please...

08:28.826 --> 08:29.918
- Take me with me.
- No!

08:30.427 --> 08:31.628
Come on, Louis, let me do some field work.

08:31.628 --> 08:33.330
Paperwork is killing me soon.

08:33.330 --> 08:34.626
Don't say it, no, it doesn't work.

08:35.365 --> 08:38.302
- I have been stuck in this office for two years.
- do not talk

08:38.302 --> 08:39.369
I can't tell you!

08:39.369 --> 08:40.859
Absolutely not!

08:41.905 --> 08:43.474
Damn, why should I pay this price?

08:43.474 --> 08:44.608
Because I am a man, I lost my job.

08:44.608 --> 08:46.269
- I can't do anything!
- Be careful, red light!

08:47.177 --> 08:49.379
You can, of course, just take me there.

08:49.379 --> 08:50.914
Enough, Ivana.

08:50.914 --> 08:52.049
Your man is dead, you still have a child.

08:52.049 --> 08:53.448
What are you going to do, I will be smashed

08:55.285 --> 08:56.954
Sorry... come and take the bus!

08:56.954 --> 08:58.649
I beg you, Louis.

08:59.490 --> 09:00.224
- Take me away from the same life
- get off

09:00.224 --> 09:01.953
I am late, rely on!

09:02.459 --> 09:04.294
- Monkey, where are you?
- Just an hour.

09:04.294 --> 09:06.956
- Monkey, have you left the remains of the statue at home?
- Please, Louis, please!

09:11.935 --> 09:12.902
Annoyed!

09:15.906 --> 09:18.272
Weasel, I am here, in the parking lot

09:18.509 --> 09:19.776
We are upstairs, fourth floor

09:19.776 --> 09:22.479
The nephew is in the aisle, Simon is on the stairs

09:22.479 --> 09:24.310
Fenfen is downstairs, next to the flower garden

09:28.485 --> 09:29.820
Channel 5, are you ready?

09:29.820 --> 09:31.082
Ready to be super good

09:31.455 --> 09:33.116
I want to fight one

09:33.690 --> 09:35.325
- That's right.
- Yes

09:35.325 --> 09:37.316
Ivana, be careful

09:38.028 --> 09:38.960
what is that?

09:40.631 --> 09:41.620
by!

09:41.965 --> 09:42.897
Louis!

09:56.346 --> 09:59.474
Police, everyone out

09:59.850 --> 10:01.078
Not allowed

10:37.821 --> 10:38.810
this is for you

10:40.390 --> 10:43.018
I am not a minor, I am 22

10:45.429 --> 10:48.660
"I was going to my mom's house and I went to the wrong floor."

10:49.333 --> 10:53.070
"The door opened and the owner pulled me in."

10:53.070 --> 10:56.206
"I want to join the game and ignore my protest."

10:56.206 --> 10:58.504
"At the same time, forcing me to wear these clothes."

10:59.376 --> 11:01.503
Please sit down

11:03.413 --> 11:06.083
- Just a little tighter!
- This is already the tightest.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.885
- Please!
- No, I can't.

11:08.885 --> 11:12.022
"What I found in my body and in my body"

11:12.022 --> 11:13.250
"Not mys"

11:13.557 --> 11:16.253
"This is just a misunderstanding"... Is this the case?

11:16.960 --> 11:17.928
That's right

11:17.928 --> 11:21.830
You are in a public place, you can't cover your face.

11:22.366 --> 11:24.368
- Sir, I have to come hard.
- no no

11:24.368 --> 11:26.802
- Mr
- Calm down, Shangnuo, bring Fatoma

11:32.643 --> 11:33.610
Please sit

11:36.580 --> 11:38.949
Sir, you have to take the mask down.

11:38.949 --> 11:39.816
no, do not want

11:39.816 --> 11:41.952
If you have a lawyer, call him now.

11:41.952 --> 11:44.785
I think too, but your colleague is investigating him.

11:46.056 --> 11:49.359
Then wait, because you still hold four grams of coca

11:49.359 --> 11:50.761
And there are underage women

11:50.761 --> 11:53.830
My God, no.

11:53.830 --> 11:55.565
Can you turn off your voice changer?

11:55.565 --> 11:57.834
Wait, I don't know if she is a young man.

11:57.834 --> 12:01.204
Coca is not mine, I can't take it.

12:01.204 --> 12:03.240
Will make me stomachache

12:03.240 --> 12:06.710
Anyway... I didn’t do anything to the girl.

12:06.710 --> 12:08.111
It’s her own around me.

12:08.111 --> 12:09.880
Do you explain it to the judge yourself?

12:09.880 --> 12:12.282
please…

12:12.282 --> 12:14.750
I am married, I have a family.

12:15.085 --> 12:17.246
- please!
- 歹 喔

12:18.121 --> 12:20.612
Signing here after trouble reading

12:21.024 --> 12:22.321
Hey, your ring

12:23.627 --> 12:25.754
You are... do you know? A Shang?

12:26.463 --> 12:27.122
what?

12:27.664 --> 12:29.791
Shang Santi! You know him?

12:31.301 --> 12:33.599
That is still, you know?

12:34.705 --> 12:36.104
Are you Ivana?

12:37.507 --> 12:38.974
You are Ivana!

12:39.543 --> 12:43.180
Thank God, thank you!

12:43.180 --> 12:44.272
who are you?

12:44.581 --> 12:45.582
I am Jay Hen.

12:45.582 --> 12:48.210
- Who?
- Jay, the accountant of Masana Jewelry Store

12:50.954 --> 12:52.922
The fake robbery in 2009!

12:54.157 --> 12:55.692
- what?
- Your loose diamond

12:55.692 --> 12:58.595
I am giving it to Shang.

12:58.595 --> 13:01.359
Do you still have earrings for the set?

13:02.032 --> 13:03.624
Gemstone with blue and white

13:06.336 --> 13:08.772
"I have never walked into this apartment."

13:08.772 --> 13:11.002
"I don't know anyone there."

13:11.742 --> 13:13.471
- You don't change your testimony?
- That's right.

13:14.244 --> 13:16.474
Ok, priest, trouble signing here

13:19.983 --> 13:20.972
Hallelujah

13:28.191 --> 13:29.317
By, Ivana!

13:29.626 --> 13:31.526
Look at me! Ivana

13:33.029 --> 13:34.360
This is good, look at me.

13:35.999 --> 13:36.988
Ah, is Louis?

13:37.667 --> 13:39.202
What happened, Ivana? What happened?

13:39.202 --> 13:41.193
Impossible, it is a nightmare

13:42.072 --> 13:44.597
- That guy said something terrible.
- what?

13:45.409 --> 13:47.411
- He told me, still...
- What is it?

13:47.411 --> 13:50.080
Rely, this is not true... rely on...

13:50.080 --> 13:51.515
What did he say to you?

13:51.515 --> 13:52.777
- He says…
- What did you say!

13:55.685 --> 13:57.346
Still another person...

13:57.654 --> 14:01.681
- What do you mean?
- He said... by...

14:05.962 --> 14:08.365
He said that he would still accept bribes.

14:08.365 --> 14:12.529
He thought I knew and told me a lot of details.

14:14.070 --> 14:15.037
This is not true

14:16.273 --> 14:17.501
Louis, isn't that true?

14:17.974 --> 14:19.566
I beg you to tell me that this is not true.

14:20.310 --> 14:21.144
This is not true, Ivana

14:21.144 --> 14:23.113
I have been working with him for seven years.

14:23.113 --> 14:24.915
If he takes a bribe, I will see it.

14:24.915 --> 14:26.049
Do not…

14:26.049 --> 14:27.851
- So what?
- By!

14:27.851 --> 14:28.909
- What is it!
- What?

14:29.352 --> 14:31.684
You gave me another expression of lying.

14:32.722 --> 14:34.724
No, I mean really...

14:34.724 --> 14:37.284
Enough, Louis, take a breath, you have to die.

14:38.028 --> 14:40.163
- Rely, I am bored.
- Calm, you will get hurt.

14:40.163 --> 14:41.531
do not you get it?

14:41.531 --> 14:45.168
I have been with a bad guy for eight years.

14:45.168 --> 14:48.604
I am eating, sleeping, going to bed with a stranger.

14:50.407 --> 14:52.242
I even gave birth to a child with him.

14:52.242 --> 14:52.943
Ivana...

14:52.943 --> 14:54.308
Do you know what is the worst?

14:54.811 --> 14:56.938
He makes an innocent person jail

14:57.581 --> 15:00.650
Remember the 2009 jewelry store to steal the case?

15:00.650 --> 15:02.345
Is still responsible for the case

15:02.686 --> 15:04.779
But that is fake, understand?

15:05.055 --> 15:06.647
This is an insurance fraud case.

15:06.990 --> 15:08.355
They are self-stealing

15:08.592 --> 15:10.560
Found to be discovered, they solve it themselves

15:11.094 --> 15:12.262
And people who are robbing know too many things

15:12.262 --> 15:13.897
They need to find someone to blame

15:13.897 --> 15:16.666
They chose the guy who didn’t do anything.

15:16.666 --> 15:17.901
That person working in the workshop

15:17.901 --> 15:20.062
Do you know how old he was? do not know?

15:20.770 --> 15:21.930
He is only 26 years old

15:22.839 --> 15:23.863
26 years old!

15:24.207 --> 15:27.267
Rely, Louis... is still arresting him.

15:27.777 --> 15:30.337
They hid the diamond in his car and turned it out.

15:30.447 --> 15:34.281
He earned 70,000 euros and my engagement ring

15:34.484 --> 15:35.746
Great, grateful

15:40.857 --> 15:42.688
Do I have anything else to lose?

15:43.727 --> 15:44.628
What do you mean?

15:44.628 --> 15:47.153
I don't know, you know everything.

15:47.797 --> 15:48.957
Tell me what else I have taken?

15:49.399 --> 15:50.331
Wait, what is it?

15:50.400 --> 15:52.636
Things that have been stolen, deceived, and stolen.

15:52.636 --> 15:53.796
Tell me the truth!

15:56.640 --> 15:57.766
Well?

16:03.513 --> 16:04.343
by!

16:06.249 --> 16:07.443
by!

16:08.184 --> 16:09.208
By North!

16:10.020 --> 16:11.317
Went to his!

16:12.355 --> 16:13.481
by!

16:14.224 --> 16:16.249
Oh! by!

16:17.894 --> 16:19.794
Super north!

16:42.185 --> 16:43.243
mom?

16:45.522 --> 16:46.682
mom!

16:48.625 --> 16:49.751
mom!

16:57.667 --> 16:59.336
- Mom!
- Ok?

16:59.336 --> 17:01.270
Why is Dad not defending himself?

17:03.807 --> 17:05.604
Because I am very tired

17:07.310 --> 17:08.503
Sorry

17:09.311 --> 17:10.506
Can you put his teeth back?

17:10.646 --> 17:11.944
Don't go tonight

17:12.082 --> 17:13.606
Let's put it again tomorrow.

17:14.317 --> 17:16.979
He will be very happy with a gold tooth.

17:18.788 --> 17:21.551
Ok, then mom, take a good rest.

17:21.891 --> 17:22.759
Thank you dear

17:22.759 --> 17:24.989
So tomorrow, Dad will come to the massacre.

17:28.665 --> 17:31.600
(Model employees are self-stealing)

17:38.041 --> 17:39.406
No, north

17:41.645 --> 17:42.771
This bastard

18:00.664 --> 18:02.029
Oh, no

18:22.452 --> 18:23.214
Ivana

18:23.486 --> 18:24.316
Ivana

18:25.321 --> 18:26.219
Where are you going?

18:26.990 --> 18:27.979
Are you going to the judge's house?

18:28.158 --> 18:28.920
No

18:29.459 --> 18:31.222
Esther said that you are going to find a judge.

18:32.128 --> 18:33.595
Can we talk about it first?

18:33.763 --> 18:36.166
Louis, don't stop me, okay?

18:36.166 --> 18:38.327
- Ivana
- Do not! Don't stop me.

18:39.436 --> 18:41.304
Enough, Ivana, he is not dead.

18:41.304 --> 18:42.105
That person is doing very well

18:42.105 --> 18:44.107
Not only doing fitness, but also learning to sing folk songs

18:44.107 --> 18:44.937
how…

18:45.975 --> 18:47.442
Do you find it interesting?

18:47.844 --> 18:49.971
What is it? Is your head decorated?

18:50.914 --> 18:52.506
Still working with the Shangs for too long, the head shell is broken?

18:53.717 --> 18:55.218
Ivana, you can't do this.

18:55.218 --> 18:58.278
Then what do you want me to do? Turn the guy to death?

18:58.621 --> 18:59.588
Close to death?

18:59.989 --> 19:02.492
He was released from prison in two weeks, and everything is over, nothing.

19:02.492 --> 19:03.356
Nothing?

19:03.860 --> 19:05.122
Are you stupid?

19:05.929 --> 19:08.659
Is innocence and guilt to be the same for you?

19:11.701 --> 19:13.635
He won't wait another two weeks, he will be released this week.

19:13.803 --> 19:15.964
I have to talk to the judge, he is leaving this week.

19:16.139 --> 19:17.574
Do you think this will end?

19:17.574 --> 19:18.942
Do you know what will happen after that?

19:18.942 --> 19:20.110
Dirty things that are still hidden

19:20.110 --> 19:22.278
All his conspiracy will be turned out one by one.

19:22.278 --> 19:23.747
Made it hard to see

19:23.747 --> 19:24.771
Listen, Louis...

19:24.981 --> 19:27.150
I was stupid enough to waste eight years on a rotten person.

19:27.150 --> 19:28.952
This is a bit embarrassing but I will try to spend

19:28.952 --> 19:32.155
But let this guy suffer innocently

19:32.155 --> 19:34.055
- I can't stand it.
- By, Ivana!

19:34.124 --> 19:35.489
Louis, what are you afraid of?

19:35.792 --> 19:37.157
afraid? I am not afraid, I have not done bad things.

19:37.293 --> 19:37.952
Best is

19:38.361 --> 19:40.261
Do you really understand or pretend?

19:40.330 --> 19:41.957
I am worried about Taiou

19:42.799 --> 19:44.167
Once things get rid of

19:44.167 --> 19:46.035
Where did he go to say that his father is a bad person?

19:46.035 --> 19:46.970
what would you do?

19:46.970 --> 19:49.063
What story do you want to tell at night to sleep?

19:50.774 --> 19:51.672
I will handle it myself.

19:52.308 --> 19:53.775
The children's books are very good now.

19:58.448 --> 19:59.813
His father passed away two years ago.

20:01.618 --> 20:03.176
He just calmed down

20:04.854 --> 20:06.515
Do you really want to kill him again?

20:46.229 --> 20:47.526
Rapid urine

20:52.202 --> 20:53.226
Tea too much

20:56.439 --> 20:57.838
No coffee here

20:58.074 --> 20:59.939
Tea is soaked in five minutes

21:02.679 --> 21:04.408
My pants are gone.

21:05.915 --> 21:06.847
Forget it

21:07.450 --> 21:09.418
Anyway, it doesn't look good, it's not bad.

21:10.186 --> 21:13.053
By the way, this T-shirt is worn with itchy, it is man-made fiber.

21:14.357 --> 21:15.124
I am sitting at the end

21:15.124 --> 21:17.493
Hey, get on the bus, Mr.

21:17.493 --> 21:19.529
I have to hit the belt one or two more holes.

21:19.529 --> 21:20.864
Rely on, I am good fat, good fat

21:20.864 --> 21:22.957
He is my brother, people are not very comfortable

21:23.233 --> 21:24.427
The brain is a bit problematic

21:24.567 --> 21:26.836
Well, how are you so fragrant?

21:26.836 --> 21:27.928
I help him pay for the car.

21:29.205 --> 21:30.172
Does this smell?

21:30.240 --> 21:31.798
What flavor is shampoo?

21:32.508 --> 21:34.533
Oh, it’s a dog’s scouring

21:35.545 --> 21:37.706
Well, smell it well.

21:38.248 --> 21:40.683
Well, good toon

21:40.683 --> 21:42.275
- It’s a paradise.
- Thank you.

21:43.186 --> 21:45.120
Oh, no! Rely on, stink!

21:45.688 --> 21:48.782
Stinky, there should be an infection, the dog should be thrown away

21:50.660 --> 21:51.922
Stinky dog

21:52.996 --> 21:56.056
Hey, puppy, stretch his tongue, stink...

22:00.970 --> 22:02.460
Was the supermarket here before?

22:04.240 --> 22:05.229
should not

22:05.975 --> 22:08.170
Was it a football field before, or was it my dream?

22:08.344 --> 22:10.747
No, I remember going through one...

22:10.747 --> 22:11.781
Yes, it used to be

22:11.781 --> 22:13.016
Previously

22:13.016 --> 22:14.751
The new mayor took office and built it two years ago...

22:14.751 --> 22:15.809
This wife

22:16.185 --> 22:17.243
Please

22:18.154 --> 22:20.987
What is it? So love to grab the words!

22:23.526 --> 22:26.120
Now even the elderly are so rude

22:27.230 --> 22:29.323
I used to be there before, I was there before.

22:30.400 --> 22:33.369
But she is right, even though she has a kitchen aftertaste

22:36.039 --> 22:38.166
You are right, madam, it used to be

22:38.975 --> 22:39.907
I used to be here before.

22:41.544 --> 22:42.670
Oops

23:17.313 --> 23:18.280
An Duan?

23:18.614 --> 23:21.777
They said it was evening, about six o’clock.

23:24.187 --> 23:26.087
why is it like this?

23:26.489 --> 23:28.616
Why didn't you call first?

23:31.194 --> 23:32.889
I... my phone is dead.

23:33.363 --> 23:35.160
How did they let you out first?

23:37.300 --> 23:39.097
I don't know, they...

23:39.335 --> 23:40.802
It should be very guilty.

23:41.237 --> 23:42.205
Is not it good?

23:42.205 --> 23:43.406
Why didn’t they tell me?

23:43.406 --> 23:44.140
I originally thought...

23:44.140 --> 23:45.875
I wanted to come early, I want to wait for you.

23:45.875 --> 23:47.410
so sorry

23:47.410 --> 23:49.412
No no no no

23:49.412 --> 23:50.646
Don't say that, dear.

23:50.646 --> 23:52.415
Sorry, I am talking nonsense.

23:52.415 --> 23:55.612
I just want to be ready, let everything go

23:57.353 --> 23:59.651
I waited for this moment for a long time.

24:01.024 --> 24:02.491
I originally thought...

24:03.226 --> 24:05.786
Waiting for you, waiting for you, watching you back

24:06.429 --> 24:08.192
I am so surprised.

24:08.965 --> 24:10.956
Happy to speak

24:13.069 --> 24:13.903
hateful

24:13.903 --> 24:15.928
It’s all messed up, it’s terrible.

24:17.673 --> 24:18.799
Hello, incense

24:19.042 --> 24:20.805
Where is it, my body is sweaty?

24:23.012 --> 24:24.445
Can you come again?

24:26.015 --> 24:27.141
what?

24:28.684 --> 24:30.743
I want you to go back to the garden entrance.

24:31.320 --> 24:32.947
Count to thirty

24:33.856 --> 24:35.983
Push the iron door open and make a rock squeak

24:36.859 --> 24:38.793
Walk slowly on the stone road

24:40.029 --> 24:42.190
Go back here, then knock on the door

24:43.533 --> 24:44.761
May I?

24:47.036 --> 24:47.798
it is good

25:29.445 --> 25:34.348
An Duan, An Duan

25:35.218 --> 25:37.652
It’s great to be back.

25:39.388 --> 25:40.912
Hey, An Duan

25:42.458 --> 25:45.950
I love you, I love you.

25:46.662 --> 25:48.630
I miss you so much.

25:52.235 --> 25:53.429
Again

25:53.569 --> 25:54.504
what?

25:54.504 --> 25:57.337
Please, go out, come back again

25:58.207 --> 25:59.196
Ok

25:59.675 --> 26:02.337
Hey... you can stop in the middle of the path.

26:03.146 --> 26:04.943
It seems that you are hesitating

26:06.182 --> 26:07.672
It seems like you are afraid...

26:08.351 --> 26:10.114
Not sure what to see

26:10.820 --> 26:11.684
it is good

27:08.344 --> 27:10.904
- It’s great to be back.
- Correct

27:13.149 --> 27:14.810
I love you, An Duan

27:15.184 --> 27:17.118
I miss you so much.

27:17.486 --> 27:19.283
Really Want

27:39.609 --> 27:40.735
What do you want to eat?

27:44.180 --> 27:45.681
Do we have money for a single point?

27:45.681 --> 27:47.239
What do you want to eat?

27:53.823 --> 27:54.824
What do you want to eat?

27:54.824 --> 27:58.861
Appetizer: warm lentils with caramelized shallots

27:58.861 --> 28:01.352
Zuo vinegar with cream and parsley, 13 euros

28:01.497 --> 28:04.867
Shiitake Hot Spring Egg Sagama "Good" Truffle Cheese Shavings

28:04.867 --> 28:07.597
The word is wrong, 16 Euro

28:08.137 --> 28:10.139
Grilled sardines with spiced mashed potatoes

28:10.139 --> 28:12.041
Spices are good and evil, mashed potatoes are crushed with a fork

28:12.041 --> 28:14.168
"Fork" is highlighted in italics

28:20.149 --> 28:22.117
I really want to know.

28:24.887 --> 28:26.479
I eat asparagus...

28:27.456 --> 28:28.753
With chicken

28:29.692 --> 28:30.556
Okay

28:32.328 --> 28:34.057
Wait for me, I will buy a packet of cigarettes.

28:34.163 --> 28:35.131
Come back in five minutes

28:35.131 --> 28:37.395
- I will order first?
- Yes, I will be back in five minutes.

29:12.935 --> 29:14.664
OX*#@$～%

29:16.772 --> 29:19.075
OX*#@$～%

29:19.075 --> 29:20.176
I do not understand

29:20.176 --> 29:22.701
Two packs of Marlboro light smoke with a box of matches

29:23.579 --> 29:25.414
I only have Camel in light smoke.

29:25.414 --> 29:26.574
Give it to me

29:27.116 --> 29:28.879
Give it to me or I will bang you

29:29.452 --> 29:33.422
- Give me the smoke.
- I am not light.

29:33.422 --> 29:34.690
I do not care!

29:34.690 --> 29:36.658
Give it to me, give it to me!

30:28.244 --> 30:29.973
- Yet?
- How?

30:30.746 --> 30:33.909
Fowa High School, two shifts in six years?

30:35.584 --> 30:36.778
Are you Marriot?

30:38.354 --> 30:39.446
Are you Santee?

30:39.588 --> 30:41.223
What are you doing here at Marriot?

30:41.223 --> 30:44.093
Santi, you guy!

30:44.093 --> 30:45.694
You are the first in the class.

30:45.694 --> 30:48.492
Is the teacher's heart and baby

30:48.731 --> 30:50.533
But I was fired because you were

30:50.533 --> 30:55.197
You told me to set fire to the laboratory, obviously Dawei

30:55.604 --> 30:57.406
why did you do this? I am innocent!

30:57.406 --> 30:59.567
why? why?

31:00.042 --> 31:02.977
For...six chocolates

31:03.879 --> 31:04.811
clam?

31:04.914 --> 31:08.717
I am telling you, Dawei will give me...

31:08.717 --> 31:10.708
Six chocolates

31:11.720 --> 31:12.888
For six chocolates?

31:12.888 --> 31:14.856
I am sorry, Marriot

31:15.558 --> 31:17.493
I was originally a medical life.

31:17.493 --> 31:20.155
But it’s not too late, you...

31:21.063 --> 31:23.896
Hit destined to meet me

31:24.233 --> 31:26.667
I am very familiar with people in big pharmaceutical factories.

31:28.337 --> 31:29.634
- Really?
- Correct

31:30.339 --> 31:32.675
Everyone should have a second chance

31:32.675 --> 31:33.505
Really?

31:33.943 --> 31:35.103
I promise

31:50.960 --> 31:55.598
You see what you turned into me, a monster

31:55.598 --> 31:58.968
Ok, just burn the scald ointment.

31:58.968 --> 32:02.802
I am innocent, you ruined my life.

32:03.739 --> 32:04.535
Wow!

32:04.773 --> 32:06.297
Dad is so strong

32:06.442 --> 32:07.841
How strong?

32:08.410 --> 32:10.310
Do you really understand or pretend?

32:12.615 --> 32:13.877
I am going to help you dry the door.

32:14.717 --> 32:16.344
You have to go out tonight.

32:16.452 --> 32:18.477
Dear, I am sorry, I have to go to work.

32:19.555 --> 32:21.989
Come, go to sleep.

32:22.291 --> 32:23.280
good night

32:30.466 --> 32:31.990
- Hi
- Hi

32:38.641 --> 32:41.844
Thank you, I thought you didn't want me to see him again.

32:41.844 --> 32:42.708
You are welcome

32:43.579 --> 32:45.069
Can't you find someone else right?

32:46.382 --> 32:47.110
That's right

32:48.050 --> 32:49.074
he has slept

32:49.952 --> 32:50.884
Correct

32:51.453 --> 32:52.852
Do I have to tell the story to him?

32:53.088 --> 32:54.020
Finished

32:55.424 --> 32:57.619
I didn't see you at work, don't you come to work?

32:57.893 --> 32:59.861
I want to have more time with Tai O

32:59.962 --> 33:00.929
I understand

33:01.263 --> 33:03.197
And I don't want to be robbed

33:03.299 --> 33:05.062
Are you trying to avoid me?

33:05.267 --> 33:07.636
I didn't want to avoid you, I didn't want to see you.

33:07.636 --> 33:09.297
Wait, Ivana

33:09.605 --> 33:10.739
Why are you blaming me?

33:10.739 --> 33:11.933
- 嘘
- I have to tell you a few times.

33:12.074 --> 33:12.870
I did not do anything

33:12.975 --> 33:13.600
But you stand by and watch

33:13.742 --> 33:15.266
Otherwise what do you want me to do? When is it to catch the scorpion?

33:15.411 --> 33:16.378
what about me?

33:17.012 --> 33:18.036
Damn, Louis

33:18.180 --> 33:19.807
Why don't you tell me?

33:20.583 --> 33:21.850
Why let me continue to be with him?

33:21.850 --> 33:24.876
- Because you love him, you love each other.
- 嘘

33:24.954 --> 33:26.581
What power do I have to destroy?

33:27.189 --> 33:29.589
Then you see how good you live.

33:30.626 --> 33:32.025
I thought you know 咧

33:38.701 --> 33:39.725
I am going to order drinks.

34:20.175 --> 34:22.699
a glass of vodka...three servings

34:56.578 --> 34:57.943
Go!

35:02.451 --> 35:03.452
That guy grabbed my wallet

35:03.452 --> 35:05.420
Where did he go?

35:05.854 --> 35:07.515
He went there.

35:12.594 --> 35:13.959
Are you ok? are you happy

35:14.063 --> 35:16.054
Very happy

35:16.799 --> 35:18.061
Great music

35:20.536 --> 35:21.525
what happened?

35:22.104 --> 35:24.334
I am always afraid that you are bored.

35:24.707 --> 35:27.073
I think you should expect a lot of things.

35:27.576 --> 35:29.544
Open up, carnival

35:30.079 --> 35:31.774
Celebrate every night

35:33.415 --> 35:34.780
But the problem is me

35:36.051 --> 35:37.382
Life is faint

35:37.519 --> 35:39.350
You are the most beautiful thing I am looking forward to.

35:40.255 --> 35:41.688
It’s like you now.

35:45.761 --> 35:47.558
- You are not angry?
- Do not

35:48.097 --> 35:51.225
Not angry, no resentment

35:51.700 --> 35:53.565
I am very calm, Janice

35:54.303 --> 35:55.204
very happy

35:55.204 --> 35:58.230
He is there! Git!

35:58.874 --> 35:59.942
Wait, don't move

35:59.942 --> 36:02.001
Bastard, I see you Zoubian

36:03.078 --> 36:05.171
Look at me to give you some color瞧瞧

36:13.155 --> 36:14.213
Be careful

36:45.387 --> 36:46.786
My ears

36:47.456 --> 36:49.356
stop! Are you crazy?

36:58.634 --> 36:59.768
He leaned my hair off

36:59.768 --> 37:01.103
- Are you ok?
- what?

37:01.103 --> 37:01.933
Are you ok?

37:06.909 --> 37:09.711
By, Jimmy!

37:09.711 --> 37:10.646
That pair of dogs and men

37:10.646 --> 37:11.547
Guy in a green jacket

37:11.547 --> 37:13.708
The police, all the way!

37:13.882 --> 37:15.684
Policemen! Stop me!

37:15.684 --> 37:18.209
By, I am the police! Policemen!

37:20.656 --> 37:23.258
- What happened?
- He ransacked those people.

37:23.258 --> 37:25.327
Also attacking us from behind

37:25.327 --> 37:26.361
Please describe the suspect's appearance

37:26.361 --> 37:28.864
description? Tell you that he is there, right there!

37:28.864 --> 37:30.399
Who is doing these things for you?

37:30.399 --> 37:33.268
Please, he is there, wearing a green coat.

37:33.268 --> 37:35.404
His girlfriend wears gray... no, red

37:35.404 --> 37:36.496
Ok, grey jacket, what else?

37:36.738 --> 37:39.942
No, it’s green, girls are wearing red

37:39.942 --> 37:41.009
Ok, red jacket, what else?

37:41.009 --> 37:43.378
Green, coat is green, girlfriend is wearing red

37:43.378 --> 37:45.581
- Calm!
- They have to take a taxi.

37:45.581 --> 37:47.583
Sir, calm down.

37:47.583 --> 37:49.218
how?

37:49.218 --> 37:51.982
When was the last time you saw the suspect?

38:02.264 --> 38:03.822
What happened?

38:04.099 --> 38:05.100
I do not know either…

38:05.100 --> 38:06.692
Wait, we were attacked.

38:07.436 --> 38:10.064
You are my idiot! You see them so excited

38:10.405 --> 38:13.575
And how can you attack so many people with bare hands?

38:13.575 --> 38:14.576
what are you saying?

38:14.576 --> 38:17.773
I feel like you are fighting like a regular meal.

38:18.080 --> 38:19.809
You just seem to start

38:19.882 --> 38:22.214
Look, there are bloodstains in the corners of your mouth.

38:24.052 --> 38:25.087
Is the driver big brother okay?

38:25.087 --> 38:26.388
Sorry, I am fine, sorry.

38:26.388 --> 38:28.323
Eight years of vacancies in my life, meaningless eight years

38:28.323 --> 38:30.359
Don't bother me with those trivial things.

38:30.359 --> 38:31.727
Is this your excuse?

38:31.727 --> 38:32.828
"I have no time to sit for eight years."

38:32.828 --> 38:34.523
"So I have the power to do something wrong"?

38:34.596 --> 38:38.032
Can slap their eyes

38:38.100 --> 38:41.069
Interrupt their teeth and hurt the girl with gas

38:41.069 --> 38:42.838
Also smashed the preserved skin?

38:42.838 --> 38:45.204
Do you know that you just bit the man's ear?

38:48.944 --> 38:49.968
Oh!

38:50.112 --> 38:52.307
Sorry, sorry.

38:52.848 --> 38:54.213
I am sorry

38:54.816 --> 38:57.580
Old pity, you are also locked into the strange

38:58.020 --> 39:01.387
how? Stealing and beating makes you feel alive?

39:01.823 --> 39:04.018
This will only make you live in prison.

39:04.526 --> 39:05.857
This is not bad.

39:07.195 --> 39:08.526
I don't recognize you anymore.

39:18.307 --> 39:20.798
An Duan, please, let me say something to make me feel at ease.

39:24.212 --> 39:27.181
I dreamed that I really ransacked the silver building every night.

39:28.083 --> 39:30.108
I am holding a rifle, an axe and a flamethrower.

39:30.352 --> 39:33.344
Go in and threaten them not to move

39:35.424 --> 39:37.790
You don’t feel relieved when you talk about these things.

39:38.427 --> 39:40.190
Really not very at ease

39:43.065 --> 39:44.828
After you get out of prison, it becomes like this?

39:45.567 --> 39:46.693
Didn't you find out?

39:47.035 --> 39:49.128
No, I am very happy, did not find

39:49.705 --> 39:51.229
I thought you were like me.

39:52.207 --> 39:53.401
Are pretending

39:56.178 --> 39:59.214
You really thought that I would like to eat Chinese food on Wednesday and have a drink on the weekend.

39:59.214 --> 40:00.545
Will this all disappear?

40:22.204 --> 40:23.068
by

40:26.375 --> 40:27.109
My ears

40:27.109 --> 40:28.477
Your wine

40:28.477 --> 40:29.808
Call you to me

40:55.937 --> 40:57.871
Why am I telling you this?

40:59.174 --> 41:00.903
Why should I talk to her like this?

41:02.344 --> 41:04.278
Can't you shut up?

41:05.647 --> 41:07.308
Shut up for five minutes

41:09.584 --> 41:11.313
Yes, but...

41:12.521 --> 41:14.489
See what she said to me.

41:14.990 --> 41:16.321
"I don't know you."

41:17.592 --> 41:20.026
Why... Why did she say this?

41:20.262 --> 41:23.031
By...he wants to start quarreling, things are in trouble.

41:23.031 --> 41:25.033
who am I? who am I?

41:25.033 --> 41:26.398
What am I?

41:26.635 --> 41:29.729
This is the problem, what am I?

41:30.372 --> 41:31.339
where am I?

41:33.208 --> 41:34.402
I was out

41:34.843 --> 41:36.504
Out of the cubicle

41:37.212 --> 41:38.440
Out of the big circle

41:40.315 --> 41:41.373
I was out

41:43.618 --> 41:45.017
I am so lonely

41:46.321 --> 41:47.879
As lonely as a stray dog

41:50.392 --> 41:51.359
by

41:52.794 --> 41:54.284
He is never bored.

41:55.630 --> 41:56.619
by

41:59.468 --> 42:00.765
Maybe she is right

42:03.405 --> 42:04.929
Maybe I am crazy.

42:08.443 --> 42:10.011
Those bastards drive me crazy

42:10.011 --> 42:11.945
What the hell am I doing?

42:12.447 --> 42:13.880
I have something else to do

42:14.182 --> 42:15.274
I have life

42:15.750 --> 42:17.012
Life like a sly life

42:17.452 --> 42:18.885
Please don't go crazy

42:19.454 --> 42:22.524
Yes, go crazy... show

42:22.524 --> 42:23.889
Completely Xiao...

42:25.293 --> 42:27.887
Completely lost in this world

42:28.897 --> 42:32.968
Lost... ferocious...and lonely

42:32.968 --> 42:35.070
I don’t know what to do.

42:35.070 --> 42:36.605
What should I do?

42:36.605 --> 42:37.772
What time is it now?

42:37.772 --> 42:38.707
what should we do?

42:38.707 --> 42:39.541
Where is he going?

42:39.541 --> 42:40.575
How to stay?

42:40.575 --> 42:42.144
- Why do I wear shoes with heels?
- Need to support?

42:42.144 --> 42:43.873
Why am I married to the bastard?

42:45.280 --> 42:46.212
by

43:24.419 --> 43:25.716
Wow

43:26.288 --> 43:27.516
What a nice view

43:32.260 --> 43:33.659
These three small?

43:39.401 --> 43:40.561
Are you okay, sir?

43:41.036 --> 43:42.025
Are you ok?

43:42.370 --> 43:43.598
God,

43:57.686 --> 44:02.623
Sir, sir.

44:02.757 --> 44:04.349
Are you ok?

44:05.894 --> 44:09.364
Sorry, sir, please.

44:09.364 --> 44:10.661
not good at all

44:11.266 --> 44:12.567
My shoulder hurts

44:12.567 --> 44:14.159
No, I am really messed up.

44:14.769 --> 44:17.761
Where did you come from?

44:17.939 --> 44:19.674
I saw you jumping into the sea, I thought...

44:19.674 --> 44:20.800
What do you think?

44:21.343 --> 44:23.044
- I thought you...
- I want to swim.

44:23.044 --> 44:25.146
I often jumped here from the age of 11

44:25.146 --> 44:26.511
I am very familiar with this area.

44:26.848 --> 44:28.383
Rely on, dead

44:28.383 --> 44:31.786
I am sorry, the misunderstanding is big.

44:31.786 --> 44:34.016
I am stupid, I am stupid.

44:34.322 --> 44:37.257
Miss, you got rid of my hand.

44:37.392 --> 44:38.827
You have to pull me, ok?

44:38.827 --> 44:40.294
Come, pull

44:40.562 --> 44:43.895
- what?
- By, I need you.

44:45.133 --> 44:46.794
How are you so good?

44:47.636 --> 44:51.072
Fast, fast pull

44:51.072 --> 44:52.474
Ok, I am pulling

44:52.474 --> 44:54.976
Wait... it hurts

44:54.976 --> 44:57.308
- I want Lara.
- Do not

44:57.379 --> 44:58.179
Pull it hard once

44:58.179 --> 44:59.547
- I am pulling.
- Quick pull

44:59.547 --> 45:00.849
Shut up, I can't

45:00.849 --> 45:01.850
Pull it hard once!

45:01.850 --> 45:03.818
Dry, can't do it!

45:04.019 --> 45:04.986
You go to someone else.

45:04.986 --> 45:05.754
No one else here!

45:05.754 --> 45:07.016
Fast, pull hard once

45:23.171 --> 45:26.572
I am lost, completely lost.

45:29.311 --> 45:30.437
What is this?

45:30.512 --> 45:31.809
This lady

45:32.147 --> 45:34.115
what are you doing?

45:35.984 --> 45:37.319
Where are you going?

45:37.319 --> 45:38.445
I do not know

45:39.454 --> 45:40.648
Italy

45:42.924 --> 45:44.482
Come back, it doesn't matter.

45:44.726 --> 45:45.624
There are relationships

45:46.127 --> 45:47.492
I have been messing around

45:47.996 --> 45:49.429
You are not messed up

45:49.631 --> 45:50.598
I have got

45:52.200 --> 45:53.599
You jumped down to save me is right...

45:56.004 --> 45:57.130
I was going to die.

45:58.306 --> 46:00.638
It’s not to comfort me.

46:00.709 --> 46:01.767
Not

46:06.214 --> 46:07.545
Why are you jumping into the sea?

46:12.220 --> 46:13.687
My life has been stolen for eight years.

46:14.422 --> 46:15.650
I have been jailed for eight years.

46:17.192 --> 46:18.386
Being humiliated

46:19.294 --> 46:20.261
Beaten

46:22.163 --> 46:24.097
Trampling, swallowing

46:25.433 --> 46:26.900
My youth was stolen

46:28.703 --> 46:29.670
For no reason

46:31.005 --> 46:32.165
I am innocent

46:32.440 --> 46:34.431
Everyone said this, but what I said is true.

46:35.844 --> 46:37.903
After I was released from prison, I have been misbehaving.

46:38.780 --> 46:40.407
Mainly to hurt others

46:41.716 --> 46:42.808
Made a lot of bad things

46:45.153 --> 46:48.390
I think I... became a monster

46:48.390 --> 46:50.085
Do not

46:50.625 --> 46:53.423
Don't think so, you didn't become a monster.

46:53.862 --> 46:57.923
You are just a person who is seriously wrong.

46:59.234 --> 47:01.464
And you have the right to be angry

47:01.569 --> 47:03.036
Make a sigh of anger

47:03.138 --> 47:05.936
You have the right

47:06.007 --> 47:08.042
Change it to me, I will want to bite

47:08.042 --> 47:09.577
Yes? and many more…

47:09.577 --> 47:12.247
I bite a person's ear less than two hours ago.

47:12.247 --> 47:13.848
- This is normal.
- Yes?

47:13.848 --> 47:16.518
It doesn't matter, be a little bigger to yourself.

47:16.518 --> 47:19.487
You don’t have to blame yourself, you don’t have to die for it.

47:20.588 --> 47:21.782
Not necessary at all

47:24.159 --> 47:25.854
Would rather be a blind man, an improper victim

47:41.976 --> 47:43.603
People have a limit

47:56.191 --> 47:57.453
what are you doing?

47:58.827 --> 47:59.919
Stealing a car

48:00.395 --> 48:02.260
- Why?
- Go home.

48:04.232 --> 48:05.824
Why not call a taxi?

48:05.967 --> 48:06.661
Do not

48:08.837 --> 48:09.667
why?

48:10.205 --> 48:11.297
Am I not entitled?

48:27.188 --> 48:28.553
I stole the car for the first time.

48:28.990 --> 48:30.287
Let's make a wish.

48:30.925 --> 48:31.949
you are right

48:32.293 --> 48:33.089
What?

48:34.762 --> 48:36.127
Would rather be a blind man, an improper victim

48:57.852 --> 48:59.410
(Policemen)

49:00.488 --> 49:01.785
This... is this your car?

49:02.490 --> 49:03.422
Correct

49:05.326 --> 49:06.486
That one…

49:07.562 --> 49:08.654
Can we meet again?

49:09.464 --> 49:10.294
No

49:10.832 --> 49:12.094
Can't you refuse me?

49:13.134 --> 49:14.294
Do you have this power?

49:14.669 --> 49:15.533
Correct

49:16.437 --> 49:18.064
I deserve a little understanding

49:18.873 --> 49:20.033
a little gentle

49:22.644 --> 49:23.770
a little beautiful

49:28.016 --> 49:29.040
a little you

49:32.186 --> 49:33.312
I can not

49:36.291 --> 49:38.259
I really want to see you again.

49:38.259 --> 49:40.161
You will be very disappointed, believe me

49:40.161 --> 49:41.219
This is not fair

49:42.163 --> 49:43.460
Fairness is very rare

49:44.432 --> 49:45.399
What about tolerance?

49:46.935 --> 49:47.867
It's required

49:52.607 --> 49:54.939
What you said to me today, completely touched me.

49:56.911 --> 49:59.277
I know that I am wrong, but I heard someone say

49:59.514 --> 50:01.277
"The reason you have the wrong"

50:02.283 --> 50:03.511
Make me very comfortable

50:06.554 --> 50:09.182
Your hand is on my back and it is very comfortable

50:12.327 --> 50:14.158
I want to kiss you.

50:15.863 --> 50:17.455
You are entitled to do this

50:25.073 --> 50:26.131
how?

50:27.208 --> 50:28.943
I should go, I have to go to work tomorrow.

50:28.943 --> 50:30.712
what? and many more

50:30.712 --> 50:32.880
Wait a minute, two minutes!

50:32.880 --> 50:33.815
Let everything go with the flow

50:33.815 --> 50:35.049
But it’s too short, wait

50:35.049 --> 50:37.483
Too short, two minutes longer

50:37.819 --> 50:38.843
by…

50:42.890 --> 50:44.357
God

50:59.841 --> 51:01.968
Are you ok? Everything is ok

51:03.544 --> 51:04.568
Correct…

51:05.580 --> 51:07.782
He just got up, we played a bit

51:07.782 --> 51:09.477
Yes, that's great.

51:10.184 --> 51:11.378
As usual

51:11.719 --> 51:12.583
Louis

51:14.222 --> 51:17.157
I want to apologize for what I said this time.

51:17.992 --> 51:19.961
I am very unfair and my temper is very bad.

51:19.961 --> 51:21.929
I should not have such behavior

51:22.463 --> 51:24.693
Sorry for being so scornful

51:24.999 --> 51:27.900
In short, we have tried our best.

51:28.302 --> 51:29.166
Ok

51:29.370 --> 51:30.805
Also, starting from tonight

51:30.805 --> 51:32.898
If you want, you can despise me.

51:33.708 --> 51:35.266
No, I am fine.

51:36.010 --> 51:36.977
Louis

51:38.880 --> 51:40.848
You don't have to respect me.

51:41.416 --> 51:42.644
Don't be too respectful

51:43.317 --> 51:44.352
Still have to

51:44.352 --> 51:47.055
No, Louis, I am also very vulnerable.

51:47.055 --> 51:48.022
No... no

51:48.022 --> 51:50.825
OK, Louis, you are very vulnerable

51:50.825 --> 51:52.452
- is it?
- Ok

51:57.165 --> 52:00.868
- You know... this fragile
- Ok

52:00.868 --> 52:03.037
Not so uncomfortable, right?

52:03.037 --> 52:04.231
Correct

52:04.739 --> 52:07.408
I can't do anything in two years, I am really fed up.

52:07.408 --> 52:09.069
- Do you understand?
- Understand, understand

52:09.377 --> 52:11.811
- I want to give up, understand?
- Ok

52:11.979 --> 52:15.210
- Can I be tolerant of myself?
- Can

52:15.283 --> 52:16.910
- Have a little gentleness
- Ok

52:22.156 --> 52:23.418
Are you jealous?

52:24.025 --> 52:24.821
No

52:25.626 --> 52:26.593
Are you okay?

52:28.362 --> 52:29.420
almost…

52:30.832 --> 52:32.493
- Louis
- Yes

52:32.667 --> 52:34.328
I want someone to kiss me.

52:37.138 --> 52:38.105
it is good

53:09.203 --> 53:10.670
I am so tired

53:11.405 --> 53:13.168
Those secrets made me breathless

53:14.575 --> 53:16.634
I killed my aunt in the kitchen.

53:17.612 --> 53:18.806
Killed with scissors

53:20.148 --> 53:21.137
When she died

53:21.282 --> 53:23.910
I slam her because I think she is laughing.

53:25.119 --> 53:27.952
I first... stabbed her chest.

53:28.022 --> 53:31.014
Then stabbed twice again... then the neck

53:31.125 --> 53:33.116
- it is good
- Then I ate her eyes...

53:33.194 --> 53:34.456
So she won’t look at me.

53:34.829 --> 53:35.659
Ok

53:36.130 --> 53:38.360
- Do you understand?
- I understand, I understand.

53:38.466 --> 53:40.301
- Then I cut her in half.
- Ok

53:40.301 --> 53:41.791
Put in a bag

53:41.869 --> 53:44.201
Put it in the garage, almost...

53:45.306 --> 53:47.137
- Two weeks.
- Ok

53:47.975 --> 53:49.374
But I will be afraid at night.

53:52.313 --> 53:54.611
- So I grabbed her hand.
- Ok

53:56.317 --> 53:58.217
Yes, I brought her

53:58.419 --> 54:05.052
Of course... it will taste a bit

54:05.726 --> 54:06.988
of course

54:09.330 --> 54:10.558
So what?

54:13.000 --> 54:14.228
Just like this

54:14.502 --> 54:18.962
Sorry, I am just absent-minded.

54:19.173 --> 54:20.708
Can you say it again from the beginning?

54:20.708 --> 54:22.642
- From scratch?
- Correct

54:24.979 --> 54:28.482
I will say it again soon, there should be no way.

54:28.482 --> 54:30.279
I understand, certain

54:31.619 --> 54:33.109
If the same happens again

54:34.121 --> 54:35.918
- I will come back to tell you.
- So be it!

54:36.023 --> 54:36.858
Come back again after the same situation

54:36.858 --> 54:38.018
Anyway, I live close

54:39.694 --> 54:40.786
I will send you out

54:47.869 --> 54:49.359
Sorry, can you talk to you?

54:51.305 --> 54:52.499
of course

54:56.577 --> 54:58.442
I want to tell you...

54:59.480 --> 55:00.310
how?

55:01.215 --> 55:02.477
This is not easy

55:02.884 --> 55:03.818
I want to say

55:03.818 --> 55:09.347
I can't stand this job for a long time, I hate it here.

55:10.858 --> 55:15.454
I have been staying at this police station.

55:15.663 --> 55:17.290
it's all because of you

55:17.698 --> 55:19.393
I want to protect you

55:19.634 --> 55:21.568
Not being hurt by others

55:22.136 --> 55:23.501
Also to see you

55:24.205 --> 55:27.333
I haven’t left because of these years.

55:27.541 --> 55:29.668
Because I have believed in you for the past eight years.

55:31.012 --> 55:34.175
Finally, you have seen me a few more days.

55:34.548 --> 55:37.415
You are holding me in the hallway and talking to me.

55:38.386 --> 55:40.354
It will be very beautiful in those days.

55:40.554 --> 55:42.523
Other days are completely meaningless

55:42.523 --> 55:43.455
Yes

55:43.624 --> 55:45.693
What happened last night, Ivana

55:45.693 --> 55:47.183
I have been waiting for several years.

55:48.696 --> 55:51.631
I also fantasized many times.

55:54.335 --> 55:56.098
- that's it
- By, Louis

55:56.370 --> 55:57.200
how

55:57.371 --> 55:59.202
Sorry, I am not listening at all.

56:01.709 --> 56:03.511
What did you just say?

56:03.511 --> 56:07.648
Oh...nothing, it’s about...

56:07.648 --> 56:08.615
Will you talk for a long time?

56:08.683 --> 56:10.751
Because I have to deal with things quickly

56:10.751 --> 56:12.954
Small things, things about parking

56:12.954 --> 56:14.522
Ok, I really have to...

56:14.522 --> 56:16.319
Ok, of course

56:19.026 --> 56:20.084
OK

56:22.263 --> 56:24.629
Who is the Ferrari that was just towed?

56:25.166 --> 56:27.301
Someone was arrested, Joey caught in the morning.

56:27.301 --> 56:28.268
Has anyone been arrested?

56:29.670 --> 56:30.728
Hey, Michel

56:44.518 --> 56:47.510
Hit me, see me kill you.

56:47.722 --> 56:49.490
I am going to kill you

56:49.490 --> 56:51.082
To shut up

56:53.227 --> 56:55.161
Give me calm!

56:55.830 --> 56:57.127
Catch him up

56:58.666 --> 57:00.429
To shut up! You are sick

57:04.171 --> 57:05.763
Open the door and open the door

57:07.375 --> 57:08.535
Go forward

57:12.213 --> 57:13.475
He leaned on my ear

57:13.748 --> 57:15.306
He bite off a piece, bastard

57:17.351 --> 57:18.648
Neuropathy...

57:22.490 --> 57:24.549
- Michelle, is your wife still okay?
- Ok.

57:27.194 --> 57:28.996
How can you please me?

57:28.996 --> 57:30.297
Please, just do it.

57:30.297 --> 57:31.665
How are you like your husband?

57:31.665 --> 57:33.167
You know that he is innocent

57:33.167 --> 57:34.301
Before, now is not

57:34.301 --> 57:37.438
He stole the famous car and bit the policeman’s ear.

57:37.438 --> 57:38.939
If I let him go, it would be me.

57:38.939 --> 57:40.341
But all this is our fault

57:40.341 --> 57:42.043
He was lost and was made into a neuropathy.

57:42.043 --> 57:44.068
He wants to go back to jail, he must not live.

57:45.112 --> 57:46.238
Do you know again?

57:47.381 --> 57:48.746
Have you met him?

57:49.717 --> 57:51.309
- Have a chat.
- You are sick!

57:51.952 --> 57:52.686
Ivana

57:52.686 --> 57:54.355
He knows what you are doing? Do you know who you are?

57:54.355 --> 57:54.989
do not know

57:54.989 --> 57:56.991
You are Xiao Xiao! I forbid you to see him.

57:56.991 --> 57:58.788
He wants to find out that he will kill you.

57:59.627 --> 58:00.821
Xiaochamou!

58:03.697 --> 58:04.459
Louis

58:04.965 --> 58:06.660
- good Morning
- How?

58:06.934 --> 58:09.503
You said, if it happens again, let me tell you

58:09.503 --> 58:11.839
Yes, but sorry, I am not available right now.

58:11.839 --> 58:13.574
I am back, bring a little...

58:13.574 --> 58:14.802
Sorry, I am not available.

58:15.076 --> 58:17.111
- Louis
- You met him yesterday, right?

58:17.111 --> 58:18.279
Just be an eyeliner

58:18.279 --> 58:19.647
How can you ask me to do this?

58:19.647 --> 58:21.114
I have to be caught and it’s over.

58:21.248 --> 58:23.079
Have you thought about it? Have you thought about me?

58:23.250 --> 58:24.685
No, because your eyes are growing overhead

58:24.685 --> 58:27.415
Only a hero or a victim, you will take a look

58:29.156 --> 58:30.418
Why are you talking to me like this?

58:32.693 --> 58:34.456
What did you do with him last night?

58:34.595 --> 58:36.324
Didn’t do anything with him?

58:36.630 --> 58:38.120
What are you doing with you?

58:39.100 --> 58:40.260
I thought you forgot

58:57.651 --> 58:59.453
- Hello, police officer.
- Boss, how are you?

58:59.453 --> 59:00.249
Want to be big?

59:00.354 --> 59:01.685
Yes, no onions

59:12.166 --> 59:13.030
Hello there

59:20.141 --> 59:22.109
Don't blame me, I can explain

59:22.109 --> 59:23.878
Because then you don't want to see me?

59:23.878 --> 59:24.708
Correct

59:25.412 --> 59:26.401
why?

59:26.914 --> 59:28.438
I feel ashamed because I don’t think it’s worth it.

59:28.616 --> 59:29.708
What are you ashamed of?

59:30.017 --> 59:32.086
Because I am... I am like this

59:32.086 --> 59:33.383
I forbid you to be ashamed

59:33.921 --> 59:37.482
You are very tolerant, very gentle, and compassionate.

59:38.025 --> 59:40.094
- completely soothing people
- Yes?

59:40.094 --> 59:42.255
I asked myself last night:

59:43.030 --> 59:45.590
"Who can understand and accept..."

59:45.966 --> 59:47.331
"And don't criticize, who?"

59:49.503 --> 59:52.097
- I…
- I just thought about it when I saw it.

59:53.107 --> 59:54.165
of course

59:54.508 --> 59:56.177
Lonely, chaotic...

59:56.177 --> 59:58.236
Human weakness, you are watching every day

59:58.345 --> 01:00:00.714
Don't be ashamed of yourself, it's not worth it.

01:00:00.714 --> 01:00:03.979
You are an angel, I don't care if you are a prostitute.

01:00:07.154 --> 01:00:08.314
My name is An Duan.

01:00:09.523 --> 01:00:10.820
My name is Ivana.

01:00:11.058 --> 01:00:12.826
This is your... flower name?

01:00:12.826 --> 01:00:13.961
Why? Does Ivana sound like a chicken?

01:00:13.961 --> 01:00:16.657
No, like picking

01:00:21.235 --> 01:00:22.429
My name is Louise.

01:00:23.404 --> 01:00:24.302
Louise

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:27.968
are you free tonight?

01:00:28.209 --> 01:00:29.699
I don't have time, I don't have any space.

01:00:29.877 --> 01:00:30.673
Louise

01:00:31.178 --> 01:00:31.940
Yes

01:00:32.346 --> 01:00:33.836
You told me last night.

01:00:34.548 --> 01:00:35.810
"Let's go with the flow"

01:00:36.684 --> 01:00:37.810
Supernatural now

01:00:38.352 --> 01:00:39.512
Do you understand?

01:00:40.254 --> 01:00:41.846
I can finally embrace the miracle

01:00:42.356 --> 01:00:44.221
Life begins to reward me.

01:00:44.658 --> 01:00:45.659
You can't refuse me

01:00:45.659 --> 01:00:49.288
Dinner... just have dinner

01:00:50.364 --> 01:00:51.331
I have the right

01:00:51.865 --> 01:00:53.696
Maybe, but not with me...

01:00:54.168 --> 01:00:57.371
Listen, An Duan... I can't... I don't want to

01:00:57.371 --> 01:00:59.240
No, Ann, my life is complicated.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:00.730
Louise, last night...

01:01:02.610 --> 01:01:04.373
It’s been the first time

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:08.077
I feel calm...

01:01:08.182 --> 01:01:08.978
Really?

01:01:09.550 --> 01:01:10.482
free…

01:01:10.985 --> 01:01:12.816
I am so touched, do you understand?

01:01:13.087 --> 01:01:14.019
Louise

01:01:14.788 --> 01:01:16.085
Last night because of you

01:01:17.925 --> 01:01:19.324
I finally got out of jail

01:01:20.494 --> 01:01:21.426
Oh

01:01:23.163 --> 01:01:26.189
See the seafood restaurant at the pier at 9:30 pm

01:01:48.722 --> 01:01:50.155
So we don’t owe each other

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.393
Now we are not owed each other

01:02:06.573 --> 01:02:08.131
This is called true fairness.

01:02:13.847 --> 01:02:15.576
Do you want 200 or 500 bills?

01:02:15.783 --> 01:02:17.341
Give me a balanced match

01:02:18.485 --> 01:02:22.723
I heard that you are preparing to go to the Silver House to make a vote.

01:02:22.723 --> 01:02:24.748
Still telling the boss to ask for a sea cut

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:27.650
I can help introduce you.

01:02:28.395 --> 01:02:29.589
Don't overdo it too much

01:02:30.297 --> 01:02:32.026
Help me keep a ring

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:33.960
Give my fiancee

01:02:38.372 --> 01:02:40.074
No, Thai, you can't interrupt

01:02:40.074 --> 01:02:41.141
Too long

01:02:41.141 --> 01:02:43.410
And I can see that Dad is pretending

01:02:43.410 --> 01:02:44.900
No, he didn't pretend

01:02:45.012 --> 01:02:46.445
Not pretending at all

01:02:48.582 --> 01:02:49.810
Thai, listen

01:02:50.751 --> 01:02:53.447
Sometimes the best people will do stupid things.

01:02:53.721 --> 01:02:57.817
Because they are afraid or want to pamper their loved ones

01:02:57.958 --> 01:02:58.992
So doing stupid things

01:02:58.992 --> 01:03:00.961
Don't be him, don't be daddy

01:03:00.961 --> 01:03:02.223
Of course it might be him

01:03:16.243 --> 01:03:17.039
An Duan?

01:03:20.914 --> 01:03:21.778
Yes

01:03:23.684 --> 01:03:24.480
An Duan

01:03:28.055 --> 01:03:28.851
Yes

01:03:31.458 --> 01:03:32.652
I'm very sorry

01:03:33.093 --> 01:03:34.128
Sorry for what?

01:03:34.128 --> 01:03:36.463
I am sorry about what happened last night.

01:03:36.463 --> 01:03:38.232
Don't say that... no need to say this

01:03:38.232 --> 01:03:39.299
But I really think so

01:03:39.299 --> 01:03:41.235
It’s my behavior is too bad.

01:03:41.235 --> 01:03:42.703
I am really scared and worried.

01:03:42.703 --> 01:03:44.261
It’s hard to get along with

01:03:47.207 --> 01:03:48.401
Don't worry, because...

01:03:50.277 --> 01:03:51.835
I am very nervous

01:03:52.646 --> 01:03:54.409
I am too strict, so you are nervous

01:03:59.153 --> 01:04:00.415
You will be harsh because...

01:04:02.089 --> 01:04:03.490
Because I hide the truth from you.

01:04:03.490 --> 01:04:04.388
because I…

01:04:06.727 --> 01:04:07.751
Lying to you

01:04:09.329 --> 01:04:11.524
You lied to me because I didn't have confidence in you.

01:04:13.634 --> 01:04:16.068
Because I am not looking at you, but watching you

01:04:19.173 --> 01:04:20.697
You monitor me because...

01:04:22.009 --> 01:04:22.805
you love Me

01:04:25.512 --> 01:04:27.343
I love you because I know the real you.

01:04:29.616 --> 01:04:31.413
Because I know that you will change back to your former

01:04:33.053 --> 01:04:34.020
Me in the past?

01:04:38.292 --> 01:04:39.691
You call An Duan

01:04:42.196 --> 01:04:43.094
Very handsome

01:04:44.131 --> 01:04:47.225
Very kind, curious, very attentive

01:04:49.770 --> 01:04:52.398
You are innocent, right?

01:04:53.774 --> 01:04:55.173
You are a jeweler

01:04:56.276 --> 01:04:57.743
People like their jobs

01:05:01.281 --> 01:05:03.749
You can find the beauty that others can't see.

01:05:07.454 --> 01:05:09.547
Know how to find diamonds from stones

01:05:29.276 --> 01:05:32.905
I just showered in...

01:06:29.369 --> 01:06:30.671
what are you doing?

01:06:30.671 --> 01:06:31.831
Why don't you sleep?

01:06:32.873 --> 01:06:34.773
Time is still early

01:06:36.443 --> 01:06:37.444
Your looks are bad

01:06:37.444 --> 01:06:39.969
I didn’t see you coming home last night, I’m so scared.

01:06:40.847 --> 01:06:42.678
No blinking all night

01:06:43.283 --> 01:06:44.875
Then close your eyes, why are you so embarrassed?

01:06:47.387 --> 01:06:49.514
Because every time I close my eyes

01:06:50.424 --> 01:06:52.051
When you open again, you are not there.

01:07:17.584 --> 01:07:18.778
Good night, Janice

01:07:19.586 --> 01:07:20.883
Good night, An Duan

01:07:38.372 --> 01:07:39.339
What are you doing here?

01:07:39.339 --> 01:07:41.174
- I need you to assist in stalking.
- what?

01:07:41.174 --> 01:07:42.843
We found the Corsican gang in the city center.

01:07:42.843 --> 01:07:44.878
- Who?
- Gangsters!

01:07:44.878 --> 01:07:46.680
- Which?
- Which?

01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:48.548
Ivana, you have to go to the office occasionally.

01:07:48.548 --> 01:07:50.083
Is the sniper of the old sailing gang

01:07:50.083 --> 01:07:51.551
He came to find Beverly to seek revenge

01:07:51.551 --> 01:07:52.853
Caught is a big case

01:07:52.853 --> 01:07:54.588
I need a female to pretend to be a couple

01:07:54.588 --> 01:07:55.622
Yi Lishi vacation

01:07:55.622 --> 01:07:56.589
Damn...

01:07:58.091 --> 01:07:59.760
- However, I can't!
- what?

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:01.695
I have an appointment and can't cancel it.

01:08:01.695 --> 01:08:03.563
- What are you kidding?
- I am not kidding

01:08:03.563 --> 01:08:04.731
How is this... is that Xiaozi?

01:08:04.731 --> 01:08:06.767
This is a complicated matter

01:08:06.767 --> 01:08:08.535
I have a hard time rejecting him, he is very vulnerable

01:08:08.535 --> 01:08:09.870
Who is in charge of you, I am discussing work

01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:10.871
You want to attend, now you have a chance

01:08:10.871 --> 01:08:13.499
If you want to continue to make up for your husband's fault, then continue.

01:08:14.908 --> 01:08:16.933
Yes, I am going right away.

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:23.649
I should go, have a good date.

01:08:23.649 --> 01:08:24.718
You don't have a gun?

01:08:24.718 --> 01:08:26.879
- I bring another one.
- Oh

01:08:27.554 --> 01:08:28.816
Do you want to stand by and follow?

01:08:32.225 --> 01:08:34.819
- Let's go! whatever
- Ok, let's go!

01:09:10.764 --> 01:09:12.493
How is this guy long? Is there a profile of the suspect?

01:09:15.268 --> 01:09:18.032
40s, black, tied scorpion, yellow bag

01:09:18.505 --> 01:09:20.131
Black people in Corsica

01:09:20.474 --> 01:09:22.374
Yeah, haven’t you seen their flag?

01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:38.325
Who is coming with us?

01:09:38.325 --> 01:09:40.292
You don’t know, special forces

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:44.059
This can't be caught, we have to go apart...

01:09:45.532 --> 01:09:46.700
- what?
- We search separately

01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:48.031
Then gather in the middle aisle, ok?

01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:54.637
Ok, I am waiting.

01:09:55.809 --> 01:09:57.572
Don’t talk to yourself, don’t stop, Anduan

01:09:58.178 --> 01:09:59.702
Ok, then I won’t say it.

01:10:00.514 --> 01:10:02.209
I am not talking in front of you.

01:10:03.550 --> 01:10:05.381
I want to drink some wine from the cup.

01:10:07.721 --> 01:10:09.018
Ah, no more.

01:10:10.423 --> 01:10:11.720
I want to come...

01:10:12.359 --> 01:10:14.528
- Trouble with bottle of brandy
- Brandy?

01:10:14.528 --> 01:10:16.155
Yes, brandy and bread

01:10:17.697 --> 01:10:18.823
Are you going to order a meal?

01:10:19.132 --> 01:10:20.326
No, I will wait a second time.

01:10:20.901 --> 01:10:22.528
- Very good.
- Calm

01:10:25.438 --> 01:10:26.370
I promise

01:10:27.774 --> 01:10:28.741
Ok

01:10:42.322 --> 01:10:43.186
An Duan?

01:10:44.424 --> 01:10:47.188
Sorry, I am still working.

01:10:49.563 --> 01:10:51.292
No, I can't say go and leave.

01:10:54.601 --> 01:10:55.735
Yes, I owe you

01:10:55.735 --> 01:10:58.101
I know what you mean, but many people around me.

01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:03.777
Otherwise what do you want me to say? let me tell you

01:11:03.777 --> 01:11:06.109
Threesome? Yes?

01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:08.315
What is it?

01:11:08.315 --> 01:11:09.182
Don't be so unkind, Ann, please.

01:11:09.182 --> 01:11:11.885
- It hurts people.
- I am not welcome.

01:11:11.885 --> 01:11:13.944
- I... I respect your work very much.
- You have a little

01:11:17.457 --> 01:11:18.583
What is this sound?

01:11:21.728 --> 01:11:25.061
Please don't pay attention to the details.

01:11:27.901 --> 01:11:30.335
Ok, they are not happy.

01:11:31.471 --> 01:11:33.666
I can't actually answer the phone...

01:11:35.442 --> 01:11:38.478
I understand, but are you still a long time?

01:11:38.478 --> 01:11:40.380
I think the people in the restaurant are a bit...

01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:43.116
I don't know... a bit complicated

01:11:43.116 --> 01:11:44.344
- I know
- A little patience...

01:11:47.621 --> 01:11:49.256
They are really upset...

01:11:49.256 --> 01:11:50.790
Ok, I heard that.

01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:51.722
I hang up

01:11:52.759 --> 01:11:53.521
see you later

01:12:04.437 --> 01:12:05.699
who is it?

01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:17.580
By North

01:12:17.918 --> 01:12:20.353
Answer the phone, Louis, connect quickly.

01:12:20.353 --> 01:12:21.650
Fast

01:12:21.888 --> 01:12:23.423
Quick pick up... good!

01:12:23.423 --> 01:12:25.225
- Hey?
- Louis, the suspect is behind you.

01:12:25.225 --> 01:12:26.359
I can't hear you, what are you talking about?

01:12:26.359 --> 01:12:29.129
- By, he is here.
- Too noisy

01:12:29.129 --> 01:12:30.630
By, he is behind you.

01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:31.426
hold on

01:12:32.265 --> 01:12:33.867
- How?
- Can you borrow a fire?

01:12:33.867 --> 01:12:35.357
- of course
- Thank you.

01:12:39.372 --> 01:12:41.397
what did you just say?

01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:45.845
Do you see the suspect?

01:12:45.845 --> 01:12:47.213
No, no picture

01:12:47.213 --> 01:12:49.049
a mess

01:12:49.049 --> 01:12:51.108
By, wait, wait a minute

01:12:52.986 --> 01:12:55.079
I am stupid.

01:12:57.424 --> 01:12:59.092
- what happened?
- I met someone from the special forces.

01:12:59.092 --> 01:13:01.428
Found him in the terror train

01:13:01.428 --> 01:13:02.554
See you there.

01:14:08.928 --> 01:14:10.054
Please, half an hour later.

01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:11.865
Sorry, sir.

01:14:11.865 --> 01:14:13.856
Trouble with your checkout and leave

01:14:15.068 --> 01:14:16.403
I thought you could be tolerant.

01:14:16.403 --> 01:14:18.633
But it’s already late, sorry

01:14:19.806 --> 01:14:21.239
I have been working for you for so long.

01:14:22.509 --> 01:14:24.306
- what?
- This napkin is what I made.

01:14:25.011 --> 01:14:27.775
Pay an hour of 3.75 euros, embroider these octopus lobsters

01:14:28.214 --> 01:14:29.340
Yes

01:14:30.517 --> 01:14:33.686
- Strange, this is what my friend did.
- Yes

01:14:33.686 --> 01:14:36.177
Yes, this is actually the last piece he made.

01:14:37.857 --> 01:14:38.687
Is he released from prison?

01:14:41.027 --> 01:14:42.187
In his way

01:14:44.831 --> 01:14:45.593
Yes

01:14:46.299 --> 01:14:50.065
I want to stew the vegetables and grill the fresh fish, don't add the cardamom.

01:14:50.904 --> 01:14:52.565
I want to call the police, sir.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.070
Then add the cardamom

01:15:03.716 --> 01:15:05.206
Hostage crisis...

01:15:05.718 --> 01:15:06.719
Repeat

01:15:06.719 --> 01:15:09.556
Hostage crisis in the third district

01:15:09.556 --> 01:15:12.792
Seafood restaurant is maddened by madman

01:15:12.792 --> 01:15:15.260
There is a madman holding a restaurant employee

01:15:49.662 --> 01:15:50.530
夭

01:15:50.530 --> 01:15:52.464
Stay here

01:15:52.732 --> 01:15:55.368
Back

01:15:55.368 --> 01:15:57.403
It’s 11:30, it’s reasonable not to accept the order.

01:15:57.403 --> 01:15:59.997
...so I stabbed him with a sickle

01:16:02.876 --> 01:16:04.036
His skill is really getting better.

01:16:15.188 --> 01:16:16.678
Where is this bastard?

01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:19.415
Here...he is here

01:16:20.593 --> 01:16:21.582
Here

01:16:22.462 --> 01:16:25.022
No... can't you settle for a few minutes?

01:16:25.532 --> 01:16:27.033
They don't order me

01:16:27.033 --> 01:16:28.201
This is the case in the countryside.

01:16:28.201 --> 01:16:30.036
An Duan, you clearly promised me.

01:16:30.036 --> 01:16:30.968
very sorry

01:16:31.804 --> 01:16:34.329
- I can not wait anymore
- Can't wait?

01:16:34.674 --> 01:16:36.505
What are you kidding! Here is like the battlefield

01:16:37.644 --> 01:16:39.111
I am two hours late, you burned the whole village.

01:16:39.646 --> 01:16:41.307
By the way, this car is leaking oil

01:16:47.554 --> 01:16:48.452
An Duan

01:16:49.856 --> 01:16:51.191
An Duan, are you injured?

01:16:51.191 --> 01:16:54.957
- A little
- Rely on, help you to bandage

01:16:55.395 --> 01:16:57.522
- Can you go to your home?
- No.

01:16:57.764 --> 01:17:00.033
- By
- You didn't have enough of me?

01:17:00.033 --> 01:17:02.268
Shut up, I am not fed up with you, of course not enough for you.

01:17:02.268 --> 01:17:03.770
I really don't know how you got it.

01:17:03.770 --> 01:17:04.938
Why am I fed up with you?

01:17:04.938 --> 01:17:06.673
I am fed up with myself.

01:17:06.673 --> 01:17:07.901
No, no, don't say that.

01:17:08.741 --> 01:17:09.742
- Leave me alone.
- Do not

01:17:09.742 --> 01:17:11.344
Policemen! Mr! Trouble you

01:17:11.344 --> 01:17:14.836
Oh, I know.

01:17:36.869 --> 01:17:37.699
What is this?

01:17:40.206 --> 01:17:41.104
Where I work

01:17:49.983 --> 01:17:51.951
- You have special expertise.
- A little

01:18:19.445 --> 01:18:22.539
- You have a lot of secrets.
- As long as you know

01:18:31.591 --> 01:18:32.853
So hot

01:18:34.861 --> 01:18:35.691
Getting hotter

01:18:36.396 --> 01:18:37.795
I may use too much dose.

01:18:38.364 --> 01:18:39.194
Correct

01:18:40.033 --> 01:18:41.000
you are so nice

01:18:42.402 --> 01:18:44.097
- Are you ok?
- Ok

01:18:45.038 --> 01:18:46.164
very good

01:18:49.075 --> 01:18:50.303
You make me calm

01:18:51.878 --> 01:18:53.038
Every time

01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:55.006
Should be the role of morphine

01:18:55.915 --> 01:18:57.007
You forgive me

01:18:58.051 --> 01:19:00.485
- Every time
- Correct

01:19:01.254 --> 01:19:02.846
Every time I see you

01:19:04.357 --> 01:19:06.018
I feel like I am worth living.

01:19:09.062 --> 01:19:10.620
You are worth living.

01:19:13.933 --> 01:19:16.094
Only you said that I believe

01:19:17.637 --> 01:19:20.306
Please, Ann, don't think that I am a good person.

01:19:20.306 --> 01:19:23.176
Of course, you saved me again.

01:19:23.176 --> 01:19:24.108
Yes, I am helping you sew the wound.

01:19:25.845 --> 01:19:28.143
When you are at the bottom of the car, you can abandon me.

01:19:31.017 --> 01:19:32.746
I will never abandon you.

01:19:34.387 --> 01:19:35.149
Why?

01:19:37.123 --> 01:19:38.317
I do not know

01:19:39.659 --> 01:19:40.421
I know

01:19:41.861 --> 01:19:43.488
Because we are fellow travelers

01:19:44.130 --> 01:19:44.994
How to say?

01:19:45.498 --> 01:19:47.466
Look around you

01:19:50.536 --> 01:19:51.468
look

01:19:55.341 --> 01:19:57.571
We are all people who like to hurt people.

01:20:49.929 --> 01:20:51.396
Sorry, I can't help it tonight.

01:20:53.733 --> 01:20:54.665
you know

01:20:55.234 --> 01:20:58.328
Telling stories requires sincerity and faith

01:20:58.671 --> 01:21:01.333
I can't do it tonight, do you understand?

01:21:02.942 --> 01:21:04.068
I know

01:21:11.784 --> 01:21:12.716
Sleep

01:21:23.162 --> 01:21:24.026
and so…

01:21:24.897 --> 01:21:27.200
Has he been missing for 72 hours?

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:29.225
- Correct
- Can you say his name again?

01:21:29.569 --> 01:21:32.595
Handkerchief, sailing

01:21:32.905 --> 01:21:37.604
Pa...air...

01:21:38.010 --> 01:21:39.307
Name...An Duan

01:21:39.912 --> 01:21:42.745
...An Duan

01:21:49.722 --> 01:21:52.247
It often happens that someone doesn’t take long

01:21:52.658 --> 01:21:54.523
Maybe drinking too much at night

01:21:55.795 --> 01:21:56.963
Or where did you go?

01:21:56.963 --> 01:21:59.693
I know that he had something in the port three days ago.

01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:03.396
I saw in the newspaper that there was a man who had a big disaster.

01:22:04.904 --> 01:22:06.606
That may not necessarily be him.

01:22:06.606 --> 01:22:09.942
After he was released from prison, he became a wrath.

01:22:09.942 --> 01:22:12.069
Thought that he has the right to misbehave

01:22:13.946 --> 01:22:15.573
If he is in jail again, he will die inside.

01:22:16.382 --> 01:22:17.178
I know

01:22:17.884 --> 01:22:18.751
Yes?

01:22:18.751 --> 01:22:19.649
I mean, I understand.

01:22:22.255 --> 01:22:23.051
He used to...

01:22:25.024 --> 01:22:26.514
Not at all like this

01:22:27.193 --> 01:22:28.285
He used to be...

01:22:30.863 --> 01:22:31.659
Make love

01:22:33.566 --> 01:22:34.863
Kind and kind

01:22:35.902 --> 01:22:37.164
This lady, are you okay?

01:22:37.570 --> 01:22:40.368
Nothing, my nose is allergic

01:22:42.642 --> 01:22:43.409
Sorry

01:22:43.409 --> 01:22:45.843
- it's all my fault
- Don't blame yourself.

01:22:46.379 --> 01:22:48.643
- Are you sure everything is ok?
- nice to me

01:22:50.716 --> 01:22:52.616
He changed, but I can't see it.

01:22:52.852 --> 01:22:54.453
Sometimes it will be like this

01:22:54.453 --> 01:22:56.045
I thought he was enough for me.

01:22:56.756 --> 01:22:58.925
Our past life is enough

01:22:58.925 --> 01:23:00.654
It’s normal to think like this.

01:23:02.728 --> 01:23:04.389
Our past has passed away

01:23:05.598 --> 01:23:06.690
You wiped it out

01:23:07.533 --> 01:23:08.668
He is very angry

01:23:08.668 --> 01:23:12.204
Obsessed with the lost time... and revenge

01:23:12.204 --> 01:23:13.728
And the damn silver building

01:23:15.575 --> 01:23:17.372
Finally, it will be very difficult to see.

01:23:19.045 --> 01:23:20.774
Must find him quickly

01:23:22.348 --> 01:23:26.045
Don't worry, we will definitely return your husband to you.

01:23:26.686 --> 01:23:28.620
I don't know what I am doing here.

01:23:29.855 --> 01:23:32.221
Here is the beginning of tragedy

01:23:34.427 --> 01:23:37.055
Desperate to find this group of executioners

01:23:39.031 --> 01:23:40.328
by

01:23:51.777 --> 01:23:52.912
An Duan

01:23:52.912 --> 01:23:54.504
Where have you been? What happened?

01:23:55.781 --> 01:23:56.543
Nothing

01:23:57.783 --> 01:23:59.307
I can't stand it, An Duan

01:24:00.186 --> 01:24:01.676
I can't continue this way.

01:24:02.655 --> 01:24:04.418
- Really can't
- I know, Janice.

01:24:06.125 --> 01:24:06.989
I know

01:24:09.528 --> 01:24:11.052
Yanis, I am tired...

01:24:11.464 --> 01:24:14.228
Try to be the original one

01:24:18.170 --> 01:24:19.330
But I can't do it

01:24:26.212 --> 01:24:27.770
I am sorry, Janice

01:24:28.514 --> 01:24:30.573
Sorry, my lover

01:24:31.851 --> 01:24:33.011
This is not our problem

01:24:35.154 --> 01:24:36.985
I just want to start over.

01:24:38.557 --> 01:24:39.717
With a person...

01:24:41.727 --> 01:24:43.126
People who didn't know me before

01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:45.592
that person

01:24:47.066 --> 01:24:48.465
Not because of me now

01:24:50.403 --> 01:24:52.394
And disappointed

01:25:15.461 --> 01:25:17.588
Sorry, I am coming again.

01:25:19.065 --> 01:25:20.599
Not available now!

01:25:20.599 --> 01:25:21.759
When is there?

01:25:22.068 --> 01:25:23.933
I don't know, Monday.

01:25:24.236 --> 01:25:25.430
Monday

01:25:33.479 --> 01:25:36.482
Is there a place where I can live on the weekend?

01:25:36.482 --> 01:25:37.972
Sir, you are enough!

01:25:48.828 --> 01:25:49.895
Can you talk?

01:25:49.895 --> 01:25:51.664
Don't be now, I am in a mess now.

01:25:51.664 --> 01:25:53.632
I don't believe it, I am also in a mess now.

01:25:53.632 --> 01:25:55.668
Rely, I hate myself.

01:25:55.668 --> 01:25:57.363
It’s a coincidence, I hate myself too.

01:25:58.637 --> 01:25:59.467
Yes?

01:26:00.072 --> 01:26:02.006
Oops, because I love you

01:26:04.710 --> 01:26:05.836
you love Me?

01:26:07.179 --> 01:26:08.612
Yes, I love you.

01:26:10.549 --> 01:26:12.016
I like... thinking about you

01:26:14.353 --> 01:26:15.980
I like how we feel when you have a date.

01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:19.490
I like you by my side.

01:26:20.059 --> 01:26:21.856
Keep me calm and make me confused

01:26:22.962 --> 01:26:24.597
I also like your voice.

01:26:24.597 --> 01:26:27.122
As soon as you open your mouth, you will feel that there will be no bad things.

01:26:29.802 --> 01:26:31.269
I like you looking at me tenderly.

01:26:33.139 --> 01:26:34.766
Because of your gentle eyes

01:26:36.642 --> 01:26:38.166
Let me want to be a better person

01:26:39.745 --> 01:26:40.973
I like your smile

01:26:41.981 --> 01:26:43.182
I love you Louis.

01:26:43.182 --> 01:26:44.750
I love you as much as I hate myself.

01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:46.217
Believe me, this contains deep love

01:26:47.019 --> 01:26:49.487
Ok, I…

01:26:49.855 --> 01:26:52.289
Can we have a drink?

01:26:56.195 --> 01:26:57.025
Ok

01:27:17.516 --> 01:27:19.618
What are you coming to?

01:27:19.618 --> 01:27:21.520
Homicide

01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:24.824
Great, let's go.

01:27:24.824 --> 01:27:26.291
follow me

01:27:26.826 --> 01:27:28.953
- not on purpose
- It's ok

01:27:29.628 --> 01:27:30.424
An Duan?

01:27:35.067 --> 01:27:35.931
An Duan?

01:27:46.512 --> 01:27:47.444
An Duan

01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:49.674
you know

01:27:51.183 --> 01:27:53.219
When you are in prison

01:27:53.219 --> 01:27:55.949
Sometimes it's really hard to fall asleep

01:27:56.255 --> 01:27:59.486
So I once a month, let myself imagine the story

01:28:00.226 --> 01:28:02.285
Give me sleep, always like this

01:28:03.629 --> 01:28:05.654
I am dreaming

01:28:06.165 --> 01:28:07.632
You are really guilty

01:28:09.735 --> 01:28:12.203
On a full moon night, you escaped from prison.

01:28:15.007 --> 01:28:16.565
You came to my room

01:28:17.576 --> 01:28:18.907
Wake me up gently

01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:22.313
You hold my hand

01:28:23.215 --> 01:28:29.120
Take me to the depths of the garden

01:28:31.056 --> 01:28:33.991
There is a hole there

01:28:34.593 --> 01:28:37.255
The jewels shine in the cave

01:28:37.696 --> 01:28:40.563
There are jewelry, diamonds...

01:28:41.133 --> 01:28:42.930
Ruby and...

01:28:43.369 --> 01:28:45.701
Two flights to tropical countries

01:28:47.506 --> 01:28:48.666
but…

01:28:49.808 --> 01:28:51.503
No…

01:28:53.379 --> 01:28:57.679
You are returning innocently, with the anger of the victim

01:29:04.223 --> 01:29:05.713
This is better

01:29:06.759 --> 01:29:09.057
You don't have to endure me anymore

01:29:12.498 --> 01:29:14.193
You are free now

01:29:16.669 --> 01:29:17.465
correct

01:29:18.804 --> 01:29:20.066
But I am like you

01:29:21.307 --> 01:29:22.740
Not so sure of myself

01:29:36.956 --> 01:29:38.253
by

01:29:39.291 --> 01:29:40.519
By the way

01:29:55.774 --> 01:29:56.604
An Duan?

01:29:58.043 --> 01:29:58.839
An Duan?

01:30:01.780 --> 01:30:03.449
Rely, is this for children?

01:30:03.449 --> 01:30:05.617
Don't do this now, we have to talk about it seriously.

01:30:05.617 --> 01:30:06.845
What are you talking about?

01:30:07.753 --> 01:30:10.085
- Talking about the future
- This is the future

01:30:11.290 --> 01:30:13.425
- Where are you going?
- I want to grab the Marshall Silver House.

01:30:13.425 --> 01:30:15.394
- I can't let you do this.
- I know

01:30:15.394 --> 01:30:16.361
can not do this

01:30:16.962 --> 01:30:18.597
Rely, An Duan! Screw you

01:30:18.597 --> 01:30:20.929
- I came back in an hour.
- let me go

01:30:22.334 --> 01:30:23.266
Why are you doing this?

01:30:25.838 --> 01:30:27.006
I am fed up with being an innocent person.

01:30:27.006 --> 01:30:29.308
hate! Hate it!

01:30:29.308 --> 01:30:30.138
All right

01:30:31.410 --> 01:30:32.138
掰

01:30:36.582 --> 01:30:40.040
Rely on

01:30:42.154 --> 01:30:44.145
X fuck der

01:30:44.656 --> 01:30:45.953
86 Marshall Avenue

01:30:46.959 --> 01:30:49.086
- what?
- 86 Marshall Avenue

01:30:50.029 --> 01:30:51.462
Hurry up

01:30:53.098 --> 01:30:55.726
Take Cano Street, it is convenient to take the road

01:30:56.201 --> 01:30:58.431
Ok, go to Cano Street

01:31:02.775 --> 01:31:04.072
do we know each other?

01:31:07.046 --> 01:31:08.604
- I should not know
- you sure?

01:31:09.381 --> 01:31:10.245
may

01:31:11.116 --> 01:31:12.640
But after all, I am carrying countless people.

01:31:20.793 --> 01:31:22.624
Parking over there, parking in front of the silver building

01:31:24.763 --> 01:31:25.923
(Marshall Silver House)

01:31:26.598 --> 01:31:29.032
Minibus, how are you? Still smoking?

01:31:35.107 --> 01:31:37.735
do not move!

01:31:38.444 --> 01:31:40.312
Shrinking on the ground...

01:31:40.312 --> 01:31:42.815
- what did he say?
- kneeling on the ground

01:31:42.815 --> 01:31:43.982
- I don’t understand.
- kneeling on the ground

01:31:43.982 --> 01:31:45.684
Allawan

01:31:45.684 --> 01:31:46.981
Rely on, is the Islamic State

01:32:05.037 --> 01:32:06.605
These three small?

01:32:06.605 --> 01:32:08.630
It’s okay to shrink on the ground.

01:32:09.041 --> 01:32:09.973
what did he say?

01:32:11.110 --> 01:32:12.211
greasy…

01:32:12.211 --> 01:32:14.379
- what?
- Is your head packed?

01:32:14.379 --> 01:32:16.711
Your majesty!

01:32:17.282 --> 01:32:18.544
Give your nest!

01:32:20.052 --> 01:32:22.543
What are you tired of? Underarm

01:32:23.956 --> 01:32:25.685
Nest, horse, horse

01:32:36.935 --> 01:32:37.731
and many more…

01:32:39.438 --> 01:32:40.268
What is in his hand?

01:32:42.641 --> 01:32:43.539
do not know

01:32:45.344 --> 01:32:47.312
It seems to be a giant...

01:32:49.081 --> 01:32:50.446
No, not an Islamic State

01:33:01.493 --> 01:33:02.289
do not move

01:33:31.223 --> 01:33:32.053
Are you ok?

01:33:33.458 --> 01:33:34.459
- Louise?
- time to go

01:33:34.459 --> 01:33:35.894
They are coming, it’s time to go.

01:33:35.894 --> 01:33:38.297
Wait, I won’t take it, I won’t go.

01:33:38.297 --> 01:33:40.065
The police are coming, hurry up.

01:33:40.065 --> 01:33:41.833
- and many more
- what are you doing?

01:33:41.833 --> 01:33:43.569
I haven't finished it yet!

01:33:43.569 --> 01:33:45.434
Are you stupid?

01:33:46.238 --> 01:33:48.073
Haven't finished yet!

01:33:48.073 --> 01:33:49.301
incredible!

01:34:24.710 --> 01:34:27.076
Then what about me?

01:34:31.450 --> 01:34:34.586
Ok, it’s time to go, these are enough.

01:34:34.586 --> 01:34:35.610
I haven’t finished

01:34:40.726 --> 01:34:42.785
Go fast, or I will shoot

01:34:43.095 --> 01:34:43.891
Go!

01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:45.831
what are you doing?

01:34:45.831 --> 01:34:47.890
You don't leave, I won't go, it's all for us.

01:34:49.735 --> 01:34:51.403
No "we"

01:34:51.403 --> 01:34:52.700
I lied to you

01:34:53.472 --> 01:34:55.770
The police will arrive in four minutes, go quickly.

01:34:57.276 --> 01:34:58.709
How do you know that it is four minutes?

01:35:02.281 --> 01:35:03.213
I know

01:35:03.815 --> 01:35:05.146
Because I have headphones

01:35:06.785 --> 01:35:08.150
I am not your love

01:35:08.687 --> 01:35:09.711
I am your enemy

01:35:13.292 --> 01:35:14.259
I am a policeman

01:35:18.030 --> 01:35:21.397
I am a policeman, I am the widow of Santi.

01:35:24.369 --> 01:35:26.071
Sorry, I thought I could help you.

01:35:26.071 --> 01:35:28.505
To shut up! To shut up!

01:35:29.975 --> 01:35:31.772
I'm going to kill you

01:35:35.714 --> 01:35:38.683
Really enough! Didn't see me helping you?

01:35:39.418 --> 01:35:40.248
Didn't see it?

01:35:40.652 --> 01:35:42.552
I was also stolen for eight years.

01:35:43.955 --> 01:35:46.389
Maybe, but you are looking for it.

01:35:53.298 --> 01:35:54.433
Go fast

01:35:54.433 --> 01:35:55.934
Otherwise it doesn't make sense.

01:35:55.934 --> 01:35:57.765
Go, you are waiting for you.

01:35:57.903 --> 01:36:01.066
There is a great life

01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:02.907
No one waiting for me

01:36:05.977 --> 01:36:07.035
I have nothing left.

01:36:08.447 --> 01:36:09.607
Nothing is gone

01:36:13.652 --> 01:36:15.244
Enough, still eat cookies

01:36:22.894 --> 01:36:25.260
Rely, they are here.

01:36:26.465 --> 01:36:28.734
Sorry, I tried my best.

01:36:28.734 --> 01:36:30.599
Wait, what are you doing?

01:36:35.307 --> 01:36:37.207
Should this be some kind of performance art?

01:36:39.378 --> 01:36:41.505
The new mayor is the left

01:36:45.283 --> 01:36:46.409
Why are you doing this?

01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:50.512
I am fed up with my guilt.

01:36:52.924 --> 01:36:54.551
What's your name?

01:36:55.827 --> 01:36:56.953
Ivana

01:36:58.764 --> 01:37:00.891
I said a truth, but you don't believe it.

01:37:12.010 --> 01:37:13.477
Farewell, Ivana

01:37:14.279 --> 01:37:15.075
farewell

01:37:17.849 --> 01:37:20.750
Although it is fake, it is beautiful

01:37:30.195 --> 01:37:30.923
Don't they kiss no?

01:38:34.893 --> 01:38:35.985
Finally

01:38:36.761 --> 01:38:37.523
correct

01:39:02.087 --> 01:39:03.111
I lost weight

01:39:04.656 --> 01:39:06.681
It’s not bad to get thin in prison.

01:39:08.994 --> 01:39:09.756
and many more

01:39:25.944 --> 01:39:26.706
Louis

01:39:38.523 --> 01:39:39.891
I thought you were released from prison tomorrow.

01:39:39.891 --> 01:39:41.059
I know, they let me out early.

01:39:41.059 --> 01:39:43.929
Sorry, I am not ready, I originally thought...

01:39:43.929 --> 01:39:45.397
do not worry

01:39:45.397 --> 01:39:46.364
I know what to do

01:39:47.032 --> 01:39:49.023
Wait, don't worry

01:39:53.572 --> 01:39:54.368
I'll be right back

01:40:27.172 --> 01:40:28.298
Dear

01:40:43.488 --> 01:40:45.479
do not move!

01:40:45.590 --> 01:40:46.420
do not move

01:40:48.159 --> 01:40:50.829
Sorry, boss, I am not good at it.

01:40:50.829 --> 01:40:53.298
I have 10 grams of good goods in my belt.

01:40:53.298 --> 01:40:54.199
Oh no no no...

01:40:54.199 --> 01:40:56.224
Take it, raise a child.

01:40:58.336 --> 01:40:59.204
Thanks, boss

01:40:59.204 --> 01:41:01.172
I have six grams in my back pocket.

01:41:01.172 --> 01:41:02.707
No, this is not good

01:41:02.707 --> 01:41:04.709
Take it, it’s a pity to throw it.

01:41:04.709 --> 01:41:05.505
Another pocket

01:41:09.014 --> 01:41:09.981
Thanks, boss

01:41:10.682 --> 01:41:11.944
There are also diamonds in...

01:41:14.986 --> 01:41:16.453
Also take it, I don’t care.

01:41:16.955 --> 01:41:19.082
- No, that's enough.
- you sure

01:41:21.793 --> 01:41:23.294
- Are you ok?
- do not worry…

01:41:23.294 --> 01:41:25.057
Willing to gamble

01:41:28.166 --> 01:41:29.531
What happened later?

01:41:32.103 --> 01:41:33.400
Nothing later

01:41:35.940 --> 01:41:36.929
ended

01:41:47.819 --> 01:41:48.786
Do you understand?

01:41:52.090 --> 01:41:53.114
I know

01:42:00.632 --> 01:42:01.758
you have grown up

01:42:02.133 --> 01:42:03.157
Not so big

01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:09.270
All right

01:42:17.148 --> 01:42:18.172
Good night, dear

01:42:19.250 --> 01:42:20.217
Good night, mom.

01:42:35.667 --> 01:42:36.634
Be careful

01:42:37.802 --> 01:42:38.928
He escaped

01:42:39.471 --> 01:42:43.675
He slipped and grabbed him.

01:42:43.675 --> 01:42:45.643
By the way, the guy hit me, I’m catching it, chasing

01:44:23.107 --> 01:44:26.076
