<i>Air and naval
forces of the United States</i>

00:09.109 --> 00:12.044
<i>launched a series of strikes</i>
<i>against terrorist facilities...</i>

00:12.079 --> 00:13.946
<i>Pan Am Flight 103 crashed
into the town of Lockerbie.</i>

00:13.981 --> 00:15.381
<i>He has sanctioned
acts of terror</i>

00:15.415 --> 00:18.050
<i>in Africa, Europe</i>
<i>and the Middle East.</i>

00:18.085 --> 00:20.753
<i>This will not stand, this
aggression against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

00:20.787 --> 00:22.455
<i>This relentless
pursuit of terror.</i>

00:22.489 --> 00:24.056
<i>We will make no distinction...</i>

00:24.091 --> 00:25.658
<i>The USS</i> Cole <i>was attacked</i>

00:25.692 --> 00:26.892
<i>while refueling in</i>
<i>the port of Aden.</i>

00:26.927 --> 00:28.794
This was an act of terrorism.

00:28.829 --> 00:31.330
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.766
<i>The next samba</i>
<i>we're going to swing for you</i>

00:33.800 --> 00:34.800
is one of the good old
favorites.

00:34.835 --> 00:37.403
...until something stops him.

00:37.437 --> 00:40.239
<i>It was right</i>
<i>in front of my eyes,</i>

00:40.273 --> 00:41.907
<i>and I never saw it coming.</i>

00:41.942 --> 00:44.977
<i>That plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

00:45.012 --> 00:47.480
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

00:47.514 --> 00:51.484
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

00:57.357 --> 00:59.525
<i>You're the smartest</i>
<i>and the dumbest fucking person</i>

00:59.559 --> 01:01.694
<i>I've ever known.</i>

01:01.728 --> 01:03.329
<i>I'm not the
one who got it wrong.</i>

01:03.363 --> 01:05.464
<i>I'm the only one</i>
<i>who got it right.</i>

01:09.336 --> 01:11.203
<i>Take 'em.</i>

01:11.238 --> 01:12.972
<i>Take 'em all.</i>

01:19.993 --> 01:23.016
Homeland - 3x09
"Horse And Wagon"

01:24.718 --> 01:26.652
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

01:26.687 --> 01:27.853
I got plans for you.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.021
What plans?

01:29.056 --> 01:30.823
I'm gonna play you back
into Iran.

01:30.857 --> 01:33.859
From now on, you work for us.

01:33.894 --> 01:35.327
The Senator's made
some serious allegations.

01:35.362 --> 01:37.697
That you had Majid Javadi
in a safe house

01:37.731 --> 01:40.299
on American soil
and let him go.

01:40.333 --> 01:42.401
We debriefed him, turned him.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.270
He's ours.

01:44.304 --> 01:48.074
I've made a decision to give
the marriage another chance.

01:48.075 --> 01:49.727
_

01:50.644 --> 01:52.645
_

01:58.719 --> 02:00.219
So I told him something

02:00.253 --> 02:02.788
before you left...
about the Langley bomber.

02:02.823 --> 02:03.989
You mean Brody.

02:04.024 --> 02:05.558
No, that's just it.
It's not him.

02:05.592 --> 02:08.026
The bomber's the only way
to prove that Brody's innocent.

02:08.061 --> 02:09.929
Carrie, what the fuck
are you doing?

02:09.963 --> 02:11.864
Carrie, turn around now.

02:11.898 --> 02:14.567
This is your last warning.

02:17.604 --> 02:19.905
Got a gunshot wound
to the upper left bicep.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.807
significant bleeding.
Might have clipped an artery.

02:21.842 --> 02:24.376
Where the fuck is Saul?

02:26.000 --> 02:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:55.708 --> 02:58.510
You're awake.

03:01.047 --> 03:02.081
Where am I?

03:02.115 --> 03:03.182
The Naval hospital.

03:03.216 --> 03:05.184
They brought you here
after you were shot.

03:08.288 --> 03:09.888
Careful, you don't want
to rip the sutures.

03:09.923 --> 03:10.989
Quite a few of them.

03:11.024 --> 03:14.593
It was a through and through.
Missed the bone.

03:14.627 --> 03:17.830
Some muscle and tissue damage
but no nerve involvement.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.164
You're lucky.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.967
No, he's just a great shot.

03:24.304 --> 03:26.004
How long will I be in here?

03:26.039 --> 03:28.740
As long as you need to be.

03:28.775 --> 03:30.109
For me to heal

03:30.143 --> 03:32.611
or for the CIA to figure out
what to do with me?

03:32.645 --> 03:34.713
You'd have to talk to them.

03:38.418 --> 03:41.286
Are you aware
you're 13 weeks pregnant?

03:41.321 --> 03:43.722
Yes.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.362
The baby should be fine.

03:50.396 --> 03:51.997
In case you're wondering.

04:08.181 --> 04:09.715
Pupils reactive to light.

04:17.322 --> 04:18.656
BP of 60 over 40.

04:18.690 --> 04:19.992
Too fucking low.

04:30.136 --> 04:34.339
Lay down.

04:35.441 --> 04:38.338
He started going
cold turkey on the flight,

04:38.373 --> 04:39.364
so they knocked him out

04:39.399 --> 04:41.280
- with a half pint of vodka.
- Idiots.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.284
Pulse is thready.

04:56.596 --> 04:58.096
Take it easy.

04:59.299 --> 05:02.301
Where's my stuff,
you fucking thieves?!

05:02.335 --> 05:03.835
Fuck! Where is my stuff?!

05:03.870 --> 05:06.104
Calm down, goddamn it!

05:12.378 --> 05:15.214
Where's my stuff?

05:15.248 --> 05:17.482
Don't move now.

05:21.621 --> 05:23.488
You've got seven days till

05:23.523 --> 05:24.489
Lockhart's confirmed.

05:24.524 --> 05:28.327
You think this guy's
gonna be ready by then?

05:28.361 --> 05:31.096
He's not what we expected...

05:31.130 --> 05:33.565
but he's what we've got.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.866
If he agrees to do it.

05:34.901 --> 05:37.236
He's a mess...

05:37.270 --> 05:39.705
anemic...

05:39.739 --> 05:43.709
severely dehydrated,
probably hep C.

05:43.743 --> 05:45.944
HIV isn't a stretch.

05:45.979 --> 05:48.313
If you're suggesting a hospital,
it's out of the question.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.882
I'm pretty sure
I can keep him stable,

05:50.917 --> 05:52.851
but the guy's a junkie, sir.

05:52.885 --> 05:54.953
How far is he into withdrawal?

05:54.988 --> 05:56.855
Hardly started.

05:56.889 --> 05:58.423
What he's feeling now,

05:58.458 --> 06:00.792
it's gonna get
a hell of a lot worse.

06:00.827 --> 06:02.928
Methadone would make it easier.

06:02.962 --> 06:04.763
Has to be cold turkey.

06:04.797 --> 06:07.666
Where he's going,
we need him functional.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.368
Even if it kills him?

06:09.402 --> 06:10.602
It won't.

06:10.637 --> 06:13.338
'Cause you will keep him alive.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.274
Do you understand?

06:16.309 --> 06:18.010
Sir.

06:58.851 --> 07:00.452
You all right?

07:02.488 --> 07:03.488
Whoa, whoa!

07:03.523 --> 07:06.091
Stop!
What are you doing?

07:06.125 --> 07:07.159
I need it!

07:07.193 --> 07:08.427
There's nothing there for you.

07:08.461 --> 07:10.896
- No, I need it now!
- No.

07:10.930 --> 07:11.930
Give it to me,
give it to me, give me...

07:11.964 --> 07:13.365
Hey, grab him!

07:17.603 --> 07:18.670
Where's the needle?

07:18.705 --> 07:20.005
Got it.

07:20.039 --> 07:22.074
Cover him up.
Stay down.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.942
Please...

07:38.124 --> 07:39.858
How are you feeling?

07:44.664 --> 07:47.799
The doctor says
you're progressing nicely.

07:47.834 --> 07:50.268
You'll be up and walking
in no time.

07:51.671 --> 07:53.004
Though, not necessarily
out of here.

07:53.039 --> 07:56.608
There are two armed guards
outside your door.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.982
You know it never ceases
to amaze me

08:04.016 --> 08:06.084
how you people close ranks.

08:07.587 --> 08:08.954
Here you are,

08:08.988 --> 08:13.592
a casualty of some CIA op
gone very, very wrong,

08:13.626 --> 08:14.926
basically a prisoner,

08:14.961 --> 08:19.898
and still, somehow,
I'm the enemy.

08:20.533 --> 08:21.500
You are aware

08:21.534 --> 08:23.935
that the CIA charter
does not include

08:23.970 --> 08:26.438
operations on US soil?

08:26.472 --> 08:29.708
You know, I'm on painkillers.

08:29.742 --> 08:33.044
I can barely understand anything
you're saying.

08:33.078 --> 08:36.148
Well...

08:36.182 --> 08:39.985
I've been going through
your file.

08:42.388 --> 08:45.090
The fact is,

08:45.124 --> 08:47.959
you need someone you can trust.

08:48.694 --> 08:51.029
And why is that?

08:51.063 --> 08:54.800
You're lying there shot
and you need to ask?

08:54.834 --> 08:58.069
The man who did this to you,

08:58.104 --> 09:00.972
he's on his way out.

09:01.007 --> 09:04.176
But I need to know...

09:04.210 --> 09:06.344
what's he up to?

09:07.814 --> 09:09.514
Ask him.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.517
What was he doing in Caracas?

09:16.255 --> 09:20.058
You didn't even know
he was there, did you?

09:36.909 --> 09:39.978
I got another message
from Carrie.

09:40.012 --> 09:41.646
Is she calming down at all?

09:41.681 --> 09:43.048
No, the opposite.

09:43.082 --> 09:47.118
Senator Lockhart
just paid her a visit.

09:47.153 --> 09:50.188
Somehow, he knows
about Caracas.

09:50.223 --> 09:51.256
It's impossible.

09:51.290 --> 09:52.624
Well, he does.

09:52.658 --> 09:55.026
You think he suspects?

09:55.061 --> 09:56.962
I'm sure he doesn't
have a clue.

09:56.996 --> 10:00.432
She does now.

10:00.466 --> 10:02.300
So what do we do about that?

10:02.335 --> 10:04.369
Same as before;

10:04.403 --> 10:07.439
keep her under guard
at the hospital.

10:07.473 --> 10:09.674
Away from Brody.

10:09.709 --> 10:11.042
And Lockhart?

10:11.077 --> 10:16.047
I don't know how
the hell he found out.

10:16.082 --> 10:20.051
No one knew besides us.

10:20.086 --> 10:22.554
Have our houses
and offices swept.

10:22.588 --> 10:25.724
Every room, top to bottom.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.166
What happened?

10:35.201 --> 10:36.201
Shat himself.

10:36.235 --> 10:37.736
Jesus Christ.

10:49.849 --> 10:51.116
Who are you?

10:51.150 --> 10:53.184
Don't talk.

10:53.219 --> 10:55.153
You're soldiers, aren't you?

10:55.187 --> 10:56.221
Don't talk.

10:56.255 --> 10:58.557
It's burning!
It's burning.

10:58.591 --> 11:00.592
It's not hot.

11:00.626 --> 11:03.028
It's burning!

11:05.798 --> 11:09.034
It'll continue as bad as
this, or worse, another three days.

11:09.068 --> 11:10.402
And at least a week after that

11:10.436 --> 11:11.770
before the stuff's out
of his system.

11:11.804 --> 11:13.738
So you're saying ten days.

11:13.773 --> 11:14.839
We have six.

11:14.874 --> 11:16.441
Plus, at the end of all this,

11:16.475 --> 11:18.643
he's gonna be weak
as a fuckin' kitten.

11:20.913 --> 11:23.281
There is another option.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.817
What?

11:25.851 --> 11:27.319
Ibogaine.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.888
It's a drug based
on a Nigerian plant.

11:29.922 --> 11:32.057
It dramatically accelerates
the withdrawal process

11:32.091 --> 11:33.725
and kills the addiction.

11:33.759 --> 11:35.760
The side effects are brutal,

11:35.795 --> 11:37.228
which is why
it's outlawed here.

11:37.263 --> 11:40.165
Nausea, vomiting,
some hallucinations.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.166
Violent,

11:41.200 --> 11:44.169
mind-bending hallucinations.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.370
Does it work?

11:46.405 --> 11:48.406
It does.

11:48.441 --> 11:51.376

Get out!

14:24.029 --> 14:26.030
What the fuck did you give me?!

14:33.239 --> 14:34.239
No...

14:58.864 --> 14:59.998
Give me that!

15:00.032 --> 15:01.065

Get off!

Get off!

15:10.776 --> 15:12.277
Get off me, no!

15:37.403 --> 15:38.870
He'll sleep now.

15:40.139 --> 15:42.140
For a while.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.019
Maybe we should just
call Saul's landline,

15:55.054 --> 15:56.554
trigger the voice activation,

15:56.589 --> 15:57.956
double-check our
tracking program.

15:57.990 --> 15:59.357
We could.

15:59.391 --> 16:01.392
But...?

16:01.427 --> 16:02.861
This house is leased to

16:02.895 --> 16:04.362
a shipping consortium
out of Tel Aviv.

16:04.396 --> 16:06.598
- It's got Mossad written all over it.
- Yeah,

16:06.632 --> 16:07.966
but what if it's just
a monitoring station,

16:08.000 --> 16:09.133
or a dead drop?

16:09.168 --> 16:11.135
Then we're wasting
our fucking time.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.244
Are you gettin' this?

16:42.401 --> 16:44.335
You're alive.

16:48.874 --> 16:50.575
That wasn't a given.

17:10.963 --> 17:12.563
Want some water?

17:12.598 --> 17:15.700
Why couldn't you have just
left me there to die?

17:17.469 --> 17:20.972
I think you know that
wasn't really an option.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.642
So...

17:28.047 --> 17:30.581
what now?

17:30.616 --> 17:33.418
That'll be up to you.

17:33.452 --> 17:35.420
A trial?

17:37.723 --> 17:39.791
'Cause I didn't do it.

17:39.825 --> 17:43.494
You talking about
bombing the CIA?

17:43.529 --> 17:45.797
I'm inclined to agree.

17:48.867 --> 17:51.769
But your transgressions
don't begin or end there.

17:53.339 --> 17:56.140
And I'm not about to engage
in a back and forth

17:56.175 --> 17:58.509
where you somehow
end up the victim.

18:00.179 --> 18:02.180
We both know what you've done.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.583
We both know what you are.

18:06.986 --> 18:09.520
A man who's dug himself
into a hole so deep,

18:09.555 --> 18:11.522
common sense'd tell you
there's no way out.

18:14.159 --> 18:18.363
I am telling you, though,
that there might be.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.799
How?

18:24.503 --> 18:27.305
I'm offering you a chance

18:27.339 --> 18:29.974
to be a Marine again.

18:33.379 --> 18:35.713
The man you were...

18:36.982 --> 18:38.983
before they broke you.

18:42.821 --> 18:44.589
Please.

18:51.163 --> 18:53.698
No more.

18:53.732 --> 18:55.033
I'm done.

18:55.067 --> 18:57.702
You are not.

18:59.872 --> 19:02.807
You will do
this one last thing.

19:02.841 --> 19:04.108
No.

19:05.878 --> 19:07.111
So kill me.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.846
Kill me now.

19:15.654 --> 19:18.056
You want to die, huh?

19:22.127 --> 19:24.929
We'll see about that.

19:45.317 --> 19:46.584
Put him overboard.

20:09.975 --> 20:12.076
Fuck this shit.
I'm going in.

20:12.111 --> 20:13.878
Don't. He'll come up.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.249
I don't believe this.

20:36.368 --> 20:38.436
Fuck it.
Let's go.

21:03.495 --> 21:04.762
Pull him...

21:17.476 --> 21:19.510
He went down like a stone.

21:19.545 --> 21:21.379
No attempt to save
himself whatsoever.

21:21.413 --> 21:23.314
Now he's refusing to eat.

21:23.348 --> 21:24.715
Make him.

21:24.750 --> 21:26.217
How do you expect us
to do that?

21:26.251 --> 21:28.853
It's called
force-feeding.

21:28.887 --> 21:29.987
All due respect, sir,

21:30.022 --> 21:31.489
the guy's a waste of space.

21:31.523 --> 21:33.591
Now, I suggest whatever
you've got in mind for him,

21:33.625 --> 21:34.759
just push it six months.

21:34.793 --> 21:35.993
Let us do this thing right.

21:36.028 --> 21:38.729
You done letting us in
on your thought process?

21:38.764 --> 21:40.898
Yes, sir.

21:40.933 --> 21:43.034
Get him to eat.

21:49.575 --> 21:51.275
He's right, you know.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.311
Our window's closing fast.

21:53.345 --> 21:55.713
It's now or never, Saul.

22:14.733 --> 22:16.100
How you feeling?

22:16.134 --> 22:18.135
As if you actually cared.

22:20.973 --> 22:23.174
You know, I've had
time to think here.

22:24.910 --> 22:26.444
And I keep coming
back to the fact

22:26.478 --> 22:27.945
that this bullet in my shoulder

22:27.980 --> 22:29.947
would never have happened
without your okay.

22:29.982 --> 22:32.083
You were about
to compromise the mission.

22:32.117 --> 22:34.619
I was about to clear Brody.

22:34.653 --> 22:36.254
You said you were behind that.

22:36.288 --> 22:37.288
"Clear Brody."

22:37.322 --> 22:38.456
What does that even mean?

22:39.925 --> 22:41.525
So you lied to me.

22:41.560 --> 22:44.095
I don't think you
want to go there--

22:44.129 --> 22:46.931
who lied to whom.

22:46.965 --> 22:48.833
Brody slipping out
of the country

22:48.867 --> 22:51.135
while you were unconscious
for 14 hours.

22:52.638 --> 22:55.106
You think I believed
that for a second?

23:06.652 --> 23:10.554
You know I was in Caracas,
you left me a message.

23:13.659 --> 23:16.227
Don't you want
to know how he is?

23:21.433 --> 23:23.401
How is he?

23:28.340 --> 23:30.708
He's not well.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.614
What did you do to him?

23:38.750 --> 23:41.051
You know, the assumptions
behind that question

23:41.086 --> 23:43.988
are so misguided,
it frightens me.

23:45.190 --> 23:48.359
I found him in a bad way.

23:50.428 --> 23:52.596
Believe me.

23:52.631 --> 23:55.165
It wasn't something I wanted.

24:00.405 --> 24:01.639
Where is he?

24:03.074 --> 24:05.042
In Virginia.

24:05.076 --> 24:07.945
At Dam Neck.

24:07.979 --> 24:10.814
Got a special ops team
trying to get him in shape.

24:10.849 --> 24:12.182
In shape for what?

24:12.217 --> 24:14.718
That's what I wanted
to talk about.

24:16.421 --> 24:20.024
I have a play.

24:20.058 --> 24:22.192
It involves Brody.

24:24.496 --> 24:25.896
And I'm hoping
you'll convince him

24:25.931 --> 24:27.865
it's in everyone's interest.

24:35.173 --> 24:37.141
You told me
Javadi was the play.

24:37.175 --> 24:38.142
He is.

24:38.176 --> 24:41.745
Brody's the next phase.

24:41.780 --> 24:44.315
And you need me why?

24:44.349 --> 24:46.550
I'm assuming he already
turned you down.

24:46.585 --> 24:47.551
We didn't get that far.

24:47.586 --> 24:49.053
Like I said, he's not well.

24:51.990 --> 24:54.258
So, what is it?
What's your big idea?

24:54.292 --> 24:56.427
Darnish Akbari.

24:58.463 --> 25:00.564
Head of Iran's
Revolutionary Guard.

25:00.599 --> 25:02.600
Right.

25:02.634 --> 25:04.335
Javadi's boss.

25:04.369 --> 25:08.005
And the single greatest
impediment to peace.

25:08.539 --> 25:10.407
I want him gone.

25:14.813 --> 25:17.514
Well, good luck with that.

25:17.549 --> 25:20.384
Brody can get to him.

25:20.418 --> 25:21.752
How?

25:21.786 --> 25:23.387
As the Langley bomber.

25:23.421 --> 25:26.557
Brody seeks political
asylum there.

25:26.591 --> 25:28.959
Gets an audience with Akbari,
takes him out.

25:31.029 --> 25:33.063
Javadi's the heir apparent.

25:33.098 --> 25:36.066
He ascends the throne,
and he goes from being

25:36.101 --> 25:38.335
one of the 20
most important people in Iran

25:38.370 --> 25:40.337
to one of three.

25:40.372 --> 25:43.907
Only he's working for us.

25:43.942 --> 25:47.244
Brody takes him out?

25:47.278 --> 25:49.179
Yes.

25:49.214 --> 25:50.914
Come on, Saul, you're reaching.

25:50.949 --> 25:53.050
Akbari's better protected
than the Ayatollah.

25:55.220 --> 25:58.722
Brody's got a knack for
getting into tight places.

25:58.757 --> 26:00.724
He's done it before.

26:00.759 --> 26:02.593
At best it's a suicide mission.

26:02.627 --> 26:06.363
No, he'll have a
team on the ground.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.465
And you expect me
to convince him of this?

26:08.500 --> 26:11.268
I expect you to consider
deeply the upside

26:11.302 --> 26:13.971
of placing a US asset
at the very top

26:14.005 --> 26:16.473
of the Iranian food chain.

26:16.508 --> 26:18.609
That's what I expect.

26:21.079 --> 26:24.381
Javadi won't be just
an intelligence source.

26:24.416 --> 26:25.683
He'll be in control

26:25.717 --> 26:29.053
of the entire Iranian
security apparatus.

26:29.087 --> 26:32.289
That doesn't mean
he'll roll over and play dead.

26:32.323 --> 26:34.091
I know.

26:34.125 --> 26:37.895
But he can do something.

26:37.896 --> 26:40.155
Something to break
the long jump.

26:41.966 --> 26:45.035
Something besides another war.

26:47.539 --> 26:50.074
Something that'll change
the facts on the ground...

26:50.108 --> 26:53.110
just enough...

26:53.144 --> 26:55.379
so two countries that haven't
been able to communicate

26:55.413 --> 26:57.848
for over 30 years

26:57.882 --> 27:00.818
except through terrorist actions
and threats...

27:02.754 --> 27:05.656
can sit down and talk.

27:11.863 --> 27:15.666
That's the play, Carrie.

27:15.700 --> 27:19.136
Tell me
it's not worth your time.

28:43.855 --> 28:45.856
Hey.

29:28.366 --> 29:30.067
Brody, I want you to know

29:30.101 --> 29:32.035
that I didn't know
you were here until today.

29:32.070 --> 29:34.037
I came as soon as I heard.

29:42.614 --> 29:45.515
Tell me if there's anything
I can do for you.

29:47.452 --> 29:49.419
Anything.

30:35.566 --> 30:37.601
When do you need him ready by?

30:37.635 --> 30:40.938
27th of this month.

30:40.972 --> 30:42.506
Why so soon?

30:42.540 --> 30:43.974
It's the day Senator Lockhart's

30:44.008 --> 30:46.310
confirmation hearings begin.

30:48.513 --> 30:51.415
Right.

30:54.619 --> 30:57.287
Tell me what happened
to him in Caracas.

30:57.322 --> 30:59.323
A world of shit
as far as we know.

30:59.357 --> 31:02.125
He was gut-shot
at the Colombian border.

31:02.160 --> 31:03.460
Nearly died.

31:03.494 --> 31:06.430
Got hooked on the painkillers,
I guess.

31:07.699 --> 31:11.268
There was also
an incident at a mosque.

31:11.302 --> 31:13.870
An imam and his wife
were murdered.

31:13.905 --> 31:16.006
Because of him?

31:16.040 --> 31:18.175
Because of him.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.785
I need a vehicle.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.494
What happened to your arm?

31:37.528 --> 31:39.329
Hang gliding accident.

31:39.364 --> 31:40.897
For real?

31:40.932 --> 31:42.099
Fucking CIA, Baraz.

31:42.133 --> 31:43.467
What are you asking
her questions for?

31:43.501 --> 31:45.969
Just making conversation.

31:49.140 --> 31:51.742
It's the next left.

32:03.187 --> 32:05.655
What now?

32:05.690 --> 32:08.825
Now we wait.

32:14.399 --> 32:16.566
We sat on the house
for 24 hours.

32:16.601 --> 32:19.369
And this is the only person
who ever came in or out.

32:19.404 --> 32:22.272
Oh, Christ.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.542
You know him?

32:25.576 --> 32:27.411
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

32:27.445 --> 32:28.712
Who is he?

32:28.746 --> 32:32.115
A friend of my wife's.

32:35.253 --> 32:38.055
His name is Alain Bernard.

32:38.089 --> 32:40.390
She met him in Mumbai.

32:40.425 --> 32:42.726
They struck up
a relationship there,

32:42.760 --> 32:45.295
which may or may not
be ongoing.

32:45.329 --> 32:46.963
I hate to ask this, Saul,

32:46.998 --> 32:49.466
but do you think Mira's aware?

32:49.500 --> 32:51.101
That he's an Israeli
intelligence officer?

32:51.135 --> 32:53.570
No.

32:53.604 --> 32:56.706
Falling for the guy is
her only crime.

32:56.741 --> 32:58.875
What do you want me to do?

32:58.910 --> 33:00.877
For the time being?

33:00.912 --> 33:02.145
Pick him up.

33:02.180 --> 33:04.981
Put him in a dark fucking hole.

33:05.016 --> 33:06.416
What about Lockhart?

33:06.451 --> 33:09.286
How does he fit
into the equation?

33:09.320 --> 33:10.720
I think I buried a lead.

33:10.755 --> 33:11.788
Meaning what?

33:11.823 --> 33:14.024
After our guy left
the safe house,

33:14.058 --> 33:15.492
I followed him to Pete's Diner,

33:15.526 --> 33:17.260
Capitol Hill.

33:48.693 --> 33:50.881
Dana?

33:54.499 --> 33:56.666
Dana?

33:56.701 --> 33:57.667
Dan...

33:57.702 --> 33:58.568
Hey, hey, hey!

33:58.603 --> 34:00.070
Hey, assholes, let me out!

34:00.104 --> 34:00.904
Brody...

34:00.938 --> 34:01.938
Get off me!

34:01.973 --> 34:03.073
Oh... God...

34:03.107 --> 34:04.374
- Let me the hell out!
- Relax!

34:05.510 --> 34:06.143
Brody!

34:06.177 --> 34:07.144
Motherfucker!

34:07.178 --> 34:08.578
Dana, it's me!

34:08.612 --> 34:09.713
Dana!

34:09.746 --> 34:11.214
- Get back...
- Get off of me...

34:11.248 --> 34:12.849
Dana!

34:12.884 --> 34:14.351
Fuck. Dana!

34:14.385 --> 34:15.819
She can't hear you, Brody.

34:15.853 --> 34:18.922
You... you bitch.

34:18.956 --> 34:21.525
You fucking bitch.

34:35.505 --> 34:38.241
Is he in?
Is he expecting you?

34:38.275 --> 34:39.876
Sir, you can't go in there.

34:39.911 --> 34:42.411
I'm hosting a
fund-raiser that night anyway.

34:42.446 --> 34:43.547
Listen, I got to go.

34:43.581 --> 34:44.748
What the hell, Saul?

34:46.050 --> 34:47.016
What is this?

34:47.051 --> 34:48.018
Open it.

35:08.206 --> 35:10.006
Care to explain?

35:10.041 --> 35:13.176
Alain Bernard is writing
a profile on me for <i>Le Monde.</i>

35:13.211 --> 35:15.178
20 minutes ago,

35:15.213 --> 35:16.513
Alain Bernard admitted to being

35:16.547 --> 35:18.915
an asset
of Israeli intelligence.

35:20.551 --> 35:23.920
And I should be concerned
about this... why?

35:23.955 --> 35:26.923
Because he claims he passed you
information obtained

35:26.958 --> 35:30.594
from a listening device
planted in my home.

35:34.031 --> 35:36.266
That's preposterous.

35:36.300 --> 35:37.934
Is it?

35:38.970 --> 35:40.904
One call to
Ambassador Benayoun,

35:40.938 --> 35:43.673
it would be
an international incident.

35:43.708 --> 35:45.675
A second call to <i>The Post,</i>

35:45.710 --> 35:48.612
and your picture'd be
on the front page

35:48.646 --> 35:51.681
of every newspaper
in the country.

35:58.756 --> 36:00.257
What do you want?

36:00.291 --> 36:03.059
Time.

36:03.094 --> 36:05.195
Time?

36:05.229 --> 36:06.396
Postpone your confirmation

36:06.430 --> 36:08.498
until the middle of next month,

36:08.532 --> 36:10.900
and these'll never
see the light of day.

36:10.935 --> 36:13.003
I don't understand.

36:13.037 --> 36:15.538
It's a simple request.

36:15.573 --> 36:16.606
Give me a few more weeks.

36:16.641 --> 36:18.174
That's not what I meant.

36:18.209 --> 36:21.378
You could destroy me with this.

36:21.412 --> 36:24.547
You could guarantee
your own tenure as director.

36:24.582 --> 36:26.516
Why are you letting me
off the hook?

36:26.550 --> 36:29.319
Because it would humiliate
my wife, Senator.

36:31.656 --> 36:34.624
And because it would
damage the Agency.

36:34.659 --> 36:36.660
Badly.

36:43.334 --> 36:45.235
We have a deal?

36:47.171 --> 36:49.406
We do.

37:16.567 --> 37:18.635
I was hoping you've calmed
down enough to talk.

37:18.669 --> 37:20.737
What's Dana doing
cleaning motel rooms

37:20.771 --> 37:22.706
- in the middle of nowhere?
- Why?

37:22.740 --> 37:23.773
Is something wrong with that?

37:23.808 --> 37:25.275
- Being a maid?
- There's nothing

37:25.309 --> 37:27.243
wrong with that, goddamn it--
I just want to know

37:27.278 --> 37:29.346
what's going on
with my daughter!

37:32.750 --> 37:35.085
Drink it, and I'll tell you
about Dana.

37:44.195 --> 37:46.162
Slowly, or you'll be sick.

37:52.670 --> 37:54.637
There.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.708
Now, what's going on?

37:58.743 --> 38:01.911
Well, she's had
a rough time, Brody.

38:01.946 --> 38:04.280
She dropped out of school.

38:04.315 --> 38:07.317
She moved out of the house.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.087
She changed her last name.

38:18.496 --> 38:19.929
Take me back to the motel.

38:19.964 --> 38:20.930
That's not gonna happen.

38:20.965 --> 38:21.931
For Christ's sake, Carrie.

38:21.966 --> 38:23.266
I told you.

38:23.300 --> 38:25.402
if you want to see her again
you have to...

38:25.436 --> 38:26.836
Quit your fucking games, Carrie!

38:26.871 --> 38:28.405
I need to look her in the eye.

38:28.439 --> 38:30.006
I want her to know
I'm innocent!

38:30.040 --> 38:32.342
If you keep yelling,
this conversation is over.

38:33.377 --> 38:35.512
Now I would like

38:35.546 --> 38:37.814
to tell these two men to leave,
can I do that?

39:02.072 --> 39:04.674
What do you want?

39:04.708 --> 39:08.044
The same thing as Saul
Berenson, I'm guessing.

39:08.078 --> 39:09.446
Some bullshit about me
being a Marine again?

39:09.480 --> 39:12.715
What do you want, Brody?

39:12.750 --> 39:15.285
What have you always wanted?

39:17.421 --> 39:18.621
A chance at redemption.

39:18.656 --> 39:22.559
For the last time, Carrie.
I didn't do the bombing.

39:22.593 --> 39:24.194
You of all people
should know that.

39:24.228 --> 39:26.696
I'm not talking
about the bombing.

39:26.730 --> 39:30.533
I'm talking
about the suicide vest.

39:32.002 --> 39:35.472
I'm talking about the death
of Elizabeth Gaines

39:35.506 --> 39:37.040
and those
two Secret Service agents

39:37.074 --> 39:39.542
outside the State Department.

39:41.512 --> 39:42.679
I'm talking about what happened

39:42.713 --> 39:45.982
to that imam and his wife
in Caracas.

39:51.822 --> 39:54.824
Do what Saul is asking.

40:00.297 --> 40:02.799
- What you're asking?
- All right, what I'm asking.

40:04.335 --> 40:07.136
If not for your sake,
then for Dana's.

40:10.207 --> 40:13.276
Otherwise, telling her
you're innocent is just...

40:14.879 --> 40:18.515
is just one more lie.

40:20.484 --> 40:22.485
Look at me, Carrie.

40:24.688 --> 40:28.458
You couldn't send me out for a
pack of cigarettes right now.

40:31.729 --> 40:33.730
We'll get you ready.

40:35.366 --> 40:38.101
You just have to be willing.

40:55.552 --> 40:58.120
Well, look who's come
out to play.

40:58.155 --> 40:59.388
About fucking time.

40:59.423 --> 41:00.823
Did you get Mommy's permission?

41:00.858 --> 41:02.925
Hey, shut the fuck up,
everybody.

41:02.960 --> 41:05.661
We're going this way.

41:05.696 --> 41:06.696
You ready?

41:25.549 --> 41:26.749
Come on.

41:26.783 --> 41:27.783
On your feet.

41:33.357 --> 41:35.591
No.
He needs to do it by himself.

41:55.712 --> 41:57.213
Tell me when you're
good to go again.

41:57.247 --> 41:58.014
Now.

41:58.048 --> 42:00.049
Go.

42:08.032 --> 42:10.522
_

42:25.042 --> 42:27.043
Find Maputo, Mozambique.

42:28.178 --> 42:29.312
What's the frequency?

42:29.346 --> 42:31.580
KHZ 3265.

42:35.719 --> 42:38.487
<i>What language</i>
<i>are they speaking?</i>

42:38.522 --> 42:39.488
Portuguese.

42:46.396 --> 42:47.496
Bottom three cards?

42:47.531 --> 42:48.764
Eight of clubs.

42:50.434 --> 42:51.267
Ten of hearts.

42:54.271 --> 42:55.871
Jack of spades?

42:58.275 --> 43:00.109
Spell her last name.

43:00.143 --> 43:02.611
Uh, B-A-C-Z-

43:02.646 --> 43:04.513
<i>E-W-S-K-I. Baczewski.</i>

43:04.548 --> 43:06.682
<i>It says here</i>
<i>she's hotter than what?</i>

43:06.717 --> 43:08.684
<i>- Georgia asphalt?</i>
<i>- And who said that?</i>

43:08.719 --> 43:10.619
Lula Fortune to Sailor Ripley

43:10.654 --> 43:11.954
in <i>Wild at Heart.</i>

43:11.989 --> 43:14.223
Fucking-A right.

43:14.257 --> 43:16.058
Yeah.

43:28.238 --> 43:30.239
So, you guys got
something going on?

43:31.341 --> 43:32.575
No.

43:32.609 --> 43:34.577
Come on, man,

43:34.611 --> 43:36.579
I've seen the way
she's checking you out

43:36.613 --> 43:37.913
when you're not looking.

43:37.948 --> 43:40.282
There's nothing.

43:40.317 --> 43:41.884
Seriously?

43:41.918 --> 43:44.553
Seriously.

43:44.588 --> 43:46.088
So, you don't mind if I...

43:46.123 --> 43:47.323
if I hit that shit then, right?

43:48.959 --> 43:51.794
See?
There is something.

43:51.828 --> 43:53.062
I knew it.

43:53.096 --> 43:54.764
No, go ahead. Really.

43:54.798 --> 43:57.166
Nah, man,
I'm just fucking with you.

43:57.200 --> 43:59.435
I'm married.

43:59.469 --> 44:02.204
And, uh, we just had
our first kid.

44:02.239 --> 44:03.472
It's a boy.

44:03.507 --> 44:06.042
Name's Devon.

44:06.076 --> 44:07.743
How come I didn't know that?

44:07.778 --> 44:10.679
Just...

44:10.714 --> 44:13.182
I don't like
talking about my family.

44:14.684 --> 44:16.185
Superstitious.

44:22.459 --> 44:23.793
Hey, we're on in five.

44:23.827 --> 44:25.294
In the briefing room.

44:29.232 --> 44:31.967
Iranian patrols
in the area are intermittent.

44:32.002 --> 44:34.970
But they are well-trained
and equipped.

44:35.005 --> 44:36.639
Also, there is also
an IRIAF base

44:36.673 --> 44:38.674
in Bijar, 70 miles away,

44:38.708 --> 44:40.643
which means they can call
in air support.

44:40.677 --> 44:42.611
What kind of
planes are we talking?

44:42.646 --> 44:44.680
Uh, some French-built
F-1 Mirages impounded

44:44.714 --> 44:46.115
from Iraq
after the First Gulf War

44:46.149 --> 44:48.317
and six Chinese SU-24s.

44:48.351 --> 44:50.219
Excuse me, can we back up
a minute?

44:50.253 --> 44:51.454
Sure.

44:51.488 --> 44:53.255
The guys gets me
to the border...

44:53.290 --> 44:54.557
where I surrender myself?

44:54.591 --> 44:56.292
Correct.

44:56.326 --> 44:58.727
We chose Marivan because
several Al-Qaeda commanders

44:58.762 --> 45:00.696
also asked
for political asylum there.

45:00.730 --> 45:03.466
What happens then?
I get flown to Tehran?

45:03.500 --> 45:06.836
After a period of vetting,
yeah, that's our expectation.

45:06.870 --> 45:09.939
Okay, but what makes you think
I'll ever get close enough

45:09.973 --> 45:12.041
to General Akbari
to take him out?

45:12.075 --> 45:15.077
You'll be treated as
a hero of the Revolution.

45:15.112 --> 45:17.179
The senior members of the
regime, like the general,

45:17.214 --> 45:20.249
want to take advantage
of your propaganda value.

45:20.283 --> 45:22.084
Plus Javadi's on the ground

45:22.119 --> 45:24.353
to facilitate a meeting
between the two of you.

45:24.387 --> 45:25.855
But if we don't know
where or when

45:25.889 --> 45:27.022
the assassination goes down...?

45:27.057 --> 45:28.858
You're concerned about
our extraction plan.

45:28.892 --> 45:30.493
How we're gonna get you
out of there once it's done?

45:30.527 --> 45:31.861
Yeah.

45:31.895 --> 45:34.530
I was just getting to that.

45:34.564 --> 45:36.465
Once you're inserted
at the border,

45:36.500 --> 45:37.533
four members of your team

45:37.567 --> 45:39.702
will continue south to Nodesheh,

45:39.736 --> 45:42.304
where they cross the mountains
and make their way overland

45:42.339 --> 45:45.841
to Lavasan, a small city
just outside Tehran.

45:45.876 --> 45:48.277
Opposition groups there
have provided us

45:48.311 --> 45:49.912
with a safe house.

45:49.946 --> 45:51.547
We've already gone ahead

45:51.581 --> 45:54.216
and put in secure Satcom.

45:54.251 --> 45:57.219
Our code there is...

46:17.374 --> 46:18.974
Since when do you smoke?

46:19.009 --> 46:20.776
I don't.

46:20.810 --> 46:22.278
I'm not.

46:26.449 --> 46:28.717
It just looks like I'm smoking.

46:32.088 --> 46:33.722
There.
It never happened.

46:33.757 --> 46:34.924
You saw nothing.

46:34.958 --> 46:37.259
Nothing.

46:39.129 --> 46:40.362
Look...

46:40.397 --> 46:41.797
I did what you asked.

46:41.831 --> 46:44.099
I'm doing what you want.

46:44.134 --> 46:47.069
Now you told me you'd
take me to see Dana again.

46:48.104 --> 46:49.805
I meant after you get back.

46:49.839 --> 46:51.407
Come on, Carrie.

46:51.441 --> 46:54.376
We both know
that's a long shot.

46:56.813 --> 46:58.681
We made it this far.

46:58.715 --> 47:00.916
That's true.

47:05.155 --> 47:07.323
I admit, I had my doubts.

47:07.357 --> 47:08.924
Oh?

47:08.959 --> 47:11.260
Is that why you've
kept your distance?

47:13.263 --> 47:14.830
Hey, it's fine.

47:14.864 --> 47:16.098
You're entitled.

47:24.274 --> 47:25.674
You're loading out
in six hours.

47:25.709 --> 47:27.676
I'm not sure I can get you off
the base and back in time.

47:27.711 --> 47:30.579
Well, I'm not leaving
until I see Dana again.

47:47.797 --> 47:50.199
It's there. 119.

47:54.838 --> 47:58.841
Brody, there's something
you need to know.

48:01.011 --> 48:02.177
Before she changed her name,

48:02.212 --> 48:03.646
before she left home...

48:06.883 --> 48:08.550
Dana was hospitalized.

48:10.687 --> 48:13.656
About two weeks
after the bombing...

48:13.690 --> 48:16.592
she tried to kill herself.

48:44.688 --> 48:46.689
Who is it?

48:48.525 --> 48:50.492
Dana, it's me.

48:51.628 --> 48:53.595
It's your dad.

49:41.010 --> 49:42.010
Hi.

49:46.649 --> 49:48.917
How did you find me?

49:55.325 --> 49:56.859
Carrie.

50:00.430 --> 50:03.031
Can I come in?

50:07.837 --> 50:09.838
Dana, please?

50:25.655 --> 50:27.656
Thank you.

50:30.693 --> 50:32.494
I had to see you.

50:35.398 --> 50:36.598
Okay.

50:36.633 --> 50:38.066
You have.

50:43.206 --> 50:45.240
Oh, my baby, I'm so sorry.

50:47.877 --> 50:48.977
Don't be.

50:55.852 --> 50:57.319
How are you now?

51:04.494 --> 51:05.861
Why are you here?

51:09.666 --> 51:11.800
I just wanted to tell you
that all those things

51:11.835 --> 51:13.802
those people said I did,
I didn't do.

51:13.837 --> 51:14.903
Fine.

51:14.938 --> 51:15.938
Fine, good.

51:15.972 --> 51:19.575
I didn't kill all those people.

51:19.609 --> 51:21.076
It wasn't me.

51:21.110 --> 51:23.579
I didn't do it.

51:30.653 --> 51:32.821
And I have to leave soon.

51:32.856 --> 51:34.823
In a few hours.

51:40.763 --> 51:43.265
But I just wanted
to see you before I go.

51:44.968 --> 51:47.436
You did.

51:49.973 --> 51:51.306
Did you ever,

51:51.341 --> 51:53.642
for one second,

51:53.676 --> 51:56.278
think about if
I wanted to see you?

51:59.182 --> 52:01.383
What... what do you
want to hear?

52:01.417 --> 52:03.452
That you were a good dad?

52:05.622 --> 52:07.489
Huh?

52:07.524 --> 52:10.759
That despite everything,
it's all okay?

52:10.793 --> 52:13.295
What do you want me to say?

52:17.000 --> 52:19.334
Look...

52:19.369 --> 52:20.502
look, here...

52:20.537 --> 52:21.837
here, just write it down.

52:21.871 --> 52:25.641
Really, just write it down
and I will say it to you...

52:27.076 --> 52:28.477
as long as you promise

52:28.511 --> 52:30.479
I will never have
to see you again.

52:37.954 --> 52:40.022
Either of you.

53:16.092 --> 53:18.760
I will come back from Tehran.

53:20.730 --> 53:22.364
I know you will.

53:25.201 --> 53:27.569
And not just for her.

54:04.974 --> 54:06.074
Where the fuck were you?

54:06.109 --> 54:07.242
He wanted to talk.

54:07.276 --> 54:09.277
He's got 45 minutes
to load out.

54:09.312 --> 54:10.746
He's all set.

54:17.754 --> 54:19.121
You took him off base.

54:19.155 --> 54:20.589
He threatened
to pull out, Saul.

54:20.623 --> 54:21.723
Anything could've
happened out there.

54:21.758 --> 54:23.925
But it didn't.

54:23.960 --> 54:26.294
I am truly at
a fuckin' loss with you.

54:28.231 --> 54:30.632
Have a little faith, Saul.

54:30.667 --> 54:32.601
Two weeks ago,
there was no operation.

54:32.635 --> 54:34.636
Now there is, because of me.

54:34.671 --> 54:38.073
I really need you to get that.

54:38.107 --> 54:40.142
Because in order for us
to pull this thing off,

54:40.176 --> 54:41.576
we're gonna have to find a way

54:41.611 --> 54:43.779
