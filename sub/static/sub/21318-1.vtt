Manuela:

Manuela:

02:53.374 --> 02:55.674
Manuela:

02:55.676 --> 02:57.442
Clifton:
Are you kidding me?

03:03.950 --> 03:07.386
<i> Mijo... mijo...</i>

03:07.388 --> 03:09.488
Clifton:
No,<i> abuela</i> , I have to
go to school.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.924
Manuela:

03:31.911 --> 03:35.581
Clifton:

03:37.817 --> 03:40.652
Manuela:

03:47.861 --> 03:49.261
Clifton:
Shut up.

03:49.263 --> 03:52.231
Manuela:

03:52.233 --> 03:54.900
Clifton:
<i> Abuela</i> , I was talking
to the phone.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.636
Manuela:

04:07.313 --> 04:09.014
Anne:
Hello!

04:09.016 --> 04:11.283
Clifton:
Yo! What's good?

04:12.719 --> 04:17.255
Oh, damn! What do we have here?

04:17.257 --> 04:18.991
A new bike!

04:18.993 --> 04:22.327
Chromoly frame.
Matte black finish.

04:22.329 --> 04:24.429
Okay, let me see this.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.569
Oh, damn.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.304
Yo, it's smooth.

05:05.505 --> 05:07.339
Shopkeeper:

05:07.341 --> 05:10.542
Clifton:
Okay. Okay. Okay.
I got it. I got it.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.915
Anne? No...

05:16.917 --> 05:18.850
<i> Putahombre...</i>

05:18.852 --> 05:20.886
What happened?

05:20.888 --> 05:23.822
I think <i> abuelita</i> threw
away all the corkscrews.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.558
She's trying not to
drink so much.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.794
So, should we go buy one?

05:28.796 --> 05:31.797
Oh, fucking pain, man,
all the way to the store?

05:31.799 --> 05:33.899
So I'm just supposed
to sit here

05:33.901 --> 05:37.669
and not drink this bottle
of four-dollar wine?

05:37.671 --> 05:39.071
Well...

05:39.073 --> 05:41.440
Jesus Christ! No! No.
Let's just get a pen.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.842
Let's just get a pen
and push the cork down.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.378
Cliff, do you have a pen?
We can push it down--

05:46.380 --> 05:50.349
no, that's stupid.
It'll just taste all corky.

05:50.351 --> 05:52.951
Doing something stupid?

05:52.953 --> 05:56.755
Rule number one,
don't do stupid things.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.790
Clifton:
So what's the occasion?

05:58.792 --> 06:01.426
Oh, I just wanted to
talk about things.

06:01.428 --> 06:03.362
Yeah?

06:03.364 --> 06:07.566
You know, I've actually heard
quite a few things in my time.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.067
Oh!

06:10.704 --> 06:13.538
What? Oh my god, no! Cliff!

06:13.540 --> 06:15.440
No. The glass, cliff.

06:15.442 --> 06:18.143
What?

06:18.145 --> 06:21.847
It'll get all ground up
in the wine. See?

06:21.849 --> 06:23.648
Hm.

06:23.650 --> 06:27.452
We just need something that's
going to take it off clean.

06:27.454 --> 06:28.687
Oh, shit...

06:28.689 --> 06:32.391
Whoaaa...

06:36.696 --> 06:37.896
Cliff.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.131
What?

06:56.716 --> 06:58.150
One, two, three, ready?

06:58.152 --> 07:00.852
All right, cliff, I am scared.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.154
One...

07:05.658 --> 07:06.958
Two...

07:06.960 --> 07:08.994
Don't do it. Seriously,
don't do it.

07:10.496 --> 07:11.963
Shit. I'm gonna do it.

07:11.965 --> 07:14.699
Okay, cliff, I think this is a
really bad idea--

07:14.701 --> 07:16.835
Clifton:

07:56.742 --> 08:00.178
Cliff:
Um... what's a chromoly frame?

08:00.180 --> 08:02.514
I just explained it to you.

08:02.516 --> 08:05.717
Oh, please, tell me what a
chromoly frame is.

08:05.719 --> 08:08.720
Look, I tried...
I tried to understand, I just...

08:08.722 --> 08:11.089
You just didn't know how
to articulate it to me.

08:11.091 --> 08:14.493
I know you're doing
that thing.

08:14.495 --> 08:16.628
What thing?

08:16.630 --> 08:20.131
The thing where you see how many
times I'll repeat myself.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.900
Oh, fuck, man!

08:21.902 --> 08:23.201
Now speaking of things

08:23.203 --> 08:24.836
what were you going
to tell me?

08:24.838 --> 08:26.838
Just hold on,
you're being way too loud.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.173
Oh, come on.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.709
I thought you had some
great news or some shit.

08:30.711 --> 08:31.943
No.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.678
Okay...

08:33.679 --> 08:35.847
The other night I went to...

08:35.849 --> 08:37.182
I went to cover a game.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.950
Uh huh.

08:38.952 --> 08:42.754
Um... fuck, this is
so weird.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.556
Um...

08:44.558 --> 08:47.292
Sorry,it's just like all of a
sudden my heart's just like,

08:47.294 --> 08:50.061
ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum.

08:50.063 --> 08:54.199
Uh... you're my best friend

08:54.201 --> 08:57.869
and I'm really worried that

08:57.871 --> 09:01.039
you're going to think
differently of me.

09:01.041 --> 09:06.177
And I don't know what I would
do without you.

09:06.179 --> 09:10.215
I, um... I like... I like...

09:10.217 --> 09:12.284
I like somebody or whatever.

09:14.954 --> 09:17.322
Oh, yeah?

09:17.324 --> 09:20.325
Yeah.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.294
Damn.

09:22.296 --> 09:24.629
I mean, you're a great friend
and all,

09:24.631 --> 09:26.798
but I kinda got a
girlfriend right now--

09:26.800 --> 09:27.999
don't be dumb.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.601
You're fuckin' dumb.

09:29.603 --> 09:31.970
Please. Seriously, can we be
serious for a second?

09:31.972 --> 09:33.772
Oh, wow, all right.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.240
All right. All right.
All right.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.008
Anne, come here.

09:40.279 --> 09:44.249
Look. Seriously, okay?
What's good?

09:46.085 --> 09:49.287
Do you know Sasha basañez?

09:49.289 --> 09:52.591
Hm, no. Who's he?

09:54.160 --> 09:57.929
Sasha basañez.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.965
Sounds like some dumb-ass
baseball player

09:59.967 --> 10:01.333
or something.

10:01.335 --> 10:03.768
That's actually a
really good guess.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.638
Oh my god, he is? Oh, so good!

10:08.874 --> 10:14.646
Except it's... softball,
not baseball.

10:43.409 --> 10:46.211
Anne:
Mom! I'll be back.

10:46.213 --> 10:49.414
Anne. Where are you going?

10:49.416 --> 10:53.418
Oh wow! What happened
to your head?

10:53.420 --> 10:55.820
Sorry. That came out wrong.
They're pretty.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.155
I have to go do a project.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.423
Where?

10:58.425 --> 11:00.225
Mom, it's right there.

11:00.227 --> 11:03.161
Well, why is this the first time
I'm hearing about a project?

11:03.163 --> 11:06.097
It's this thing. It's on acids
and bases, it's due tomorrow.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.999
Actually, no, no,
it was due today,

11:08.001 --> 11:10.769
but my stupid lab partner didn't
have her thing done.

11:10.771 --> 11:13.238
So it's already going to be a
whole letter-grade off.

11:13.240 --> 11:16.007
Every second that I'm standing
here makes the likelihood

11:16.009 --> 11:18.977
of us finishing on time go down
just... just that much more.

11:18.979 --> 11:22.981
Okay. If you keep your pants on,
I'll drive you. Ten minutes.

11:22.983 --> 11:25.450
No, mom! I have to go to school

11:25.452 --> 11:27.819
'cause I left my bike there
like an idiot.

11:27.821 --> 11:32.757
Can I just go? Mom!
Before it gets dark, please.

11:32.759 --> 11:36.961
Why do I feel like you're
lying to me?

11:36.963 --> 11:39.798
Huh? Why am I getting that
feeling? Uh!

11:39.800 --> 11:42.033
Because the world is out
to get you

11:42.035 --> 11:44.402
and it's a big
fucking conspiracy.

11:44.404 --> 11:48.273
Anne, you know, you sound like a
dummy when you talk like that?

11:48.275 --> 11:50.842
Kids your age use curse words
like a crutch.

11:50.844 --> 11:53.745
Obscenities belie an
inarticulateness

11:53.747 --> 11:56.147
that characterizes your
entire generation...

11:56.149 --> 11:57.382
And if you ask me--

11:57.384 --> 11:59.384
the way you talk is so annoying.

11:59.386 --> 12:03.421
Hm, that's not a very
nice thing to say.

12:07.493 --> 12:10.829
Sat instructor:
All right, we've got five
answers to choose from.

12:10.831 --> 12:13.732
Five answers, where do we start
on a question like this?

12:13.734 --> 12:15.433
Anybody? Anybody. Somebody.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.035
In the middle?

12:17.037 --> 12:19.871
In the middle. Thank you.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.106
Sasha:
Hey, mom!

12:21.108 --> 12:24.242
Rita:
<i> Hey, honey!</i>

12:24.244 --> 12:29.914
I'm gonna hop in the shower!
Also, my friend's coming over.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.182
<i> Okay!</i>

13:06.786 --> 13:09.420
Sasha:
<i> I got it!</i>

13:11.857 --> 13:13.391
Sasha:
<i> Hi.</i>

13:13.393 --> 13:15.794
Anne:
<i> Hey! Uh, I'm really</i>
<i> sorry I'm late.</i>

13:15.796 --> 13:17.462
<i> I didn't know where</i>
<i> you lived,</i>

13:17.464 --> 13:19.831
<i> so I parked somewhere</i>
<i> else really far away.</i>

13:19.833 --> 13:22.534
<i> I dunno, I was gonna walk, but</i>
<i> it's like why walk anywhere,</i>

13:22.536 --> 13:23.935
I have my own car, right?

13:23.937 --> 13:25.136
Right.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.437
Hello.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.540
Oh, this is Anne.
Uh, she's from yearbook.

13:28.542 --> 13:30.141
We're doing a project.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.043
Oh! Are you from
the school yearbook?

13:32.045 --> 13:33.278
Mom, I just said that.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.946
Rita:
<i> Andi!</i>

13:34.948 --> 13:37.382
<i> You should ask her how she's</i>
<i> able to balance school</i>

13:37.384 --> 13:38.583
<i> and athletics.</i>

13:38.585 --> 13:40.318
'Cause most kids can't do
that...

13:40.320 --> 13:43.454
...but this one can pull it off.
Top 15% of her class!

13:43.456 --> 13:44.956
Oh my god.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.224
Andi!

13:46.226 --> 13:48.026
Andi:
<i> What! I'm outside!</i>

13:50.329 --> 13:51.996
Did you buy superfoods?

13:51.998 --> 13:54.566
Rita:
Uh, yes,
i bought the superfoods.

13:54.568 --> 13:56.067
Thank you.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.869
Rita:
<i> Fifteen percent of her class!</i>

13:57.871 --> 13:59.070
Okay, bye!

13:59.072 --> 14:00.505
<i> Bye!</i>

14:03.275 --> 14:05.076
Your mom's awesome.

14:05.078 --> 14:08.880
Yeah. Uh, come on in.

14:12.952 --> 14:14.853
Sorry, it's like really messy.

14:14.855 --> 14:16.888
Oh, my house is
a lot messier than this.

14:16.890 --> 14:19.591
You're like the first friend
I've had over in like months.

14:19.593 --> 14:21.559
Besides Amanda panda,
Trisha and Lexi,

14:21.561 --> 14:23.228
but they're just like, whatever.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.629
And I guess, "friend,"

14:24.631 --> 14:27.065
I don't know if I would...
You know what I mean.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.499
Uh, yeah.

14:28.501 --> 14:32.637
Um, it's just so busy.
I never get to just like

14:32.639 --> 14:35.940
you know what I mean?

14:35.942 --> 14:37.375
Definitely.

14:37.377 --> 14:41.579
Sorry. You probably think I'm
like, wah! Or something.

14:41.581 --> 14:45.884
Oh, I'm going to get a
superfood, do you want one?

14:45.886 --> 14:48.219
Okay?

14:48.221 --> 14:51.656
It must be, like, really cool,
like, getting to do what you do.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.458
What? What do I do?

14:53.460 --> 14:56.160
You know, get to learn about
people and stuff.

14:56.162 --> 14:58.229
No, I'm sitting in front
of a computer

14:58.231 --> 14:59.664
doing boring layout stuff.

14:59.666 --> 15:02.133
Like, you're the coolest
girl in the school.

15:02.135 --> 15:03.568
Oh my god, no.
I'm so lame.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.104
What? No. One, you're
like the star athlete.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.973
Two, you're really good
at school, right?

15:08.975 --> 15:12.477
I mean, you're in the... you're
in the top 15% of your class.

15:12.479 --> 15:13.945
Yeah.

15:16.181 --> 15:19.617
Uh, so was I supposed to do
anything for this?

15:19.619 --> 15:22.420
I have, like, never been
interviewed before, so.

15:22.422 --> 15:26.057
It's... it's really easy.
Uh, okay.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.525
Question one...

15:27.527 --> 15:29.460
Oh my god, I'm so scared.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.062
Why?

15:31.064 --> 15:33.498
I dont know, what if I say
the wrong thing?

15:33.500 --> 15:35.099
We'll start with an easy one.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.168
A softball, if you will.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.437
Oh, I can definitely talk about
softball.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.706
No, it's not...

15:41.708 --> 15:44.575
Never mind. How old are you?

15:44.577 --> 15:47.478
Eighteen? Yeah. Eighteen.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.213
So you're a senior?

15:49.215 --> 15:50.481
Yep.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.951
Okay....

15:52.953 --> 15:56.054
Do you have a boyfriend?

15:58.290 --> 16:00.491
Um...

16:00.493 --> 16:03.695
Uh...

16:03.697 --> 16:06.297
This is one of the...
The standard questions.

16:06.299 --> 16:09.467
Right. Um... no.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.103
No boyfriend for me.

16:12.105 --> 16:16.507
You just like...
You don't have the time or...?

16:20.713 --> 16:23.614
Ha. I'm getting really nervous.

16:23.616 --> 16:26.017
No. Yeah, of course. Of course.

16:26.019 --> 16:27.552
Um, let's shift gears.

16:27.554 --> 16:30.288
Let's just... shifting gears.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.023
Here's a great one. Okay.

16:32.025 --> 16:34.559
If you could have
dinner with anyone,

16:34.561 --> 16:38.529
living or dead,
with whom would it be?

16:38.531 --> 16:41.366
I don't know. Oh,
Michael Jackson?

16:41.368 --> 16:43.534
Or no. That's stupid.

16:43.536 --> 16:47.605
Um, say I said...

16:47.607 --> 16:49.674
Teddy Roosevelt.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.442
Teddy Roosevelt.

17:24.676 --> 17:26.310
Anne:
...Whenever you can.

17:26.311 --> 17:28.311
I don't know what's
good for you.

17:28.314 --> 17:31.215
Oh, no. It gives me a reason
to get out of practice early.

17:31.217 --> 17:34.352
I'll just tell them we have some
follow-up questions or whatever.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.387
They basically let me
do whatever I want.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.755
Because you're a goody-goody.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.190
No, I'm not.

17:39.192 --> 17:40.391
"No, I'm not."

17:40.393 --> 17:41.726
You're so mean!

17:41.728 --> 17:44.062
I'm sorry. I know.
That's a really bad habit.

17:44.064 --> 17:45.496
No, I... I like when you do it.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.665
I don't know why.

17:47.667 --> 17:50.435
Are you sure you don't want
a ride to your car?

17:50.437 --> 17:52.103
Canoga's like super sketch.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.771
Been workin' out.

17:53.773 --> 17:57.408
Oh. Promise you won't get
raped and get aids and die?

17:57.410 --> 17:59.544
I promise.

17:59.546 --> 18:03.848
Okay. Well... bye.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.351
And good bye to you!

18:11.590 --> 18:14.525
Should we do it like
they do in Europe?

18:14.527 --> 18:16.461
How do they do
it in Europe?

18:18.398 --> 18:20.731
Oh. Wait. Let me try again.

18:38.383 --> 18:39.617
<i> Oui, oui, oui.</i>

18:39.619 --> 18:41.786
Nice.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.821
Would you like a cigarette?

18:43.823 --> 18:45.289
Would you like a cigarette?

18:45.291 --> 18:46.557
Cigarette!

18:48.695 --> 18:52.363
Okay. Uh, I'm going now.

18:52.365 --> 18:55.233
Okay. Bye.

18:55.235 --> 18:57.902
Bye.

18:57.904 --> 18:59.804
Bye.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.539
Bye.

19:01.541 --> 19:02.740
Bye.

19:11.216 --> 19:14.785
Girls:

19:34.206 --> 19:37.341
Sasha:
<i> Hey. I'm bored. Entertain me.</i>

20:03.970 --> 20:06.671
<i> Anne:</i>
<i> Do be do, do be do, waaaa!</i>

20:06.673 --> 20:09.473
Sasha:
<i> I can totally imagine you</i>
<i> singing that right now.</i>

20:09.475 --> 20:11.542
<i> Regionals,</i>
<i> we're going to win for sure.</i>

20:11.544 --> 20:13.344
<i> It's more state I'm</i>
<i> worried about.</i>

20:13.346 --> 20:15.780
Anne:
<i> Is it weird that I'm worried</i>
<i> about it too?</i>

20:15.782 --> 20:17.215
<i> I don't even like sports.</i>

20:17.217 --> 20:18.849
Sasha:
<i> Getting to state is everything</i>

20:18.851 --> 20:20.918
<i> I've been practicing</i>
<i> for since forever.</i>

20:20.920 --> 20:23.254
<i> But now if we lost I</i>
<i> wouldn't even care.</i>

20:23.256 --> 20:24.689
<i> Except we wouldn't get to miss</i>
<i> school.</i>

20:24.691 --> 20:26.524
<i> Do you think you'll play</i>
<i> softball in college?</i>

20:26.526 --> 20:27.758
<i> Do you think you'll</i>
<i> play football in college?</i>

20:27.760 --> 20:29.327
<i> Do you think you'll do</i>

20:29.329 --> 20:30.595
<i> synchronized swimming</i>
<i> in college?</i>

20:30.597 --> 20:31.829
<i> Synchronized swimming</i>
<i> is really hard.</i>

20:31.831 --> 20:33.297
<i> Don't knock it.</i>

20:33.299 --> 20:34.832
<i> One time I tried to do</i>
<i> one of those</i>

20:34.834 --> 20:36.400
<i> twirly upside-down</i>
<i> things in a pool</i>

20:36.402 --> 20:38.269
<i> and inhaled a big gulp of</i>
<i> water and passed out.</i>

20:38.271 --> 20:39.870
<i> One time I wasn't supposed</i>
<i> to go to batting practice</i>

20:39.872 --> 20:39.870
<i> but I went anyway.</i>

20:39.872 --> 20:43.007
<i> It was right after I'd already</i>
<i> messed up my shoulder</i>

20:43.009 --> 20:45.476
<i>and I popped my shoulder out of</i>
<i> its socket.</i>

20:45.478 --> 20:47.511
<i> How come you're only now</i>
<i> taking the sats?</i>

20:47.513 --> 20:49.513
<i> Did you take the sats</i>
<i> when you were 12?</i>

20:49.515 --> 20:51.282
Sasha/anne:
<i> Do you have any brothers or</i>
<i> sisters?</i>

20:51.284 --> 20:52.717
Sasha/anne:
<i> Nope. /yep.</i>

20:52.719 --> 20:54.719
<i> What do you want to be</i>
<i> when you grow up?</i>

20:54.721 --> 20:56.454
Sasha:
<i> Sometimes I think I want</i>
<i> to be a teacher,</i>

20:56.456 --> 20:58.422
<i> for really little kids.</i>

20:58.424 --> 21:00.391
Anne:
<i> I want to live in an apartment</i>
<i> in New York City</i>

21:00.393 --> 21:01.692
<i>and have a job where I take the</i>
<i> subway to get there</i>

21:01.694 --> 21:03.327
<i> and have to change lines.</i>

21:03.329 --> 21:04.729
<i> It doesn't matter what I'm</i>
<i> doing--</i>

21:04.731 --> 21:06.430
Sasha:
<i> What if your job is--</i>

21:06.432 --> 21:08.466
Anne:
<i> I guess it has to be creative.</i>

21:08.468 --> 21:10.901
Sasha:
<i> You're so creative.</i>
<i> You're gonna be an artist.</i>

21:10.903 --> 21:12.670
Anne:
<i> And smoke a ton of cigarettes.</i>

21:12.672 --> 21:14.372
Sasha:
<i> By the way, that's gross.</i>

21:14.374 --> 21:16.407
Anne:
<i> I know. I'm trying to quit.</i>

21:16.409 --> 21:18.743
Sasha:
<i> I have to go play this game,</i>
<i> one sec.</i>

21:34.793 --> 21:36.027
Umpire:
<i> Take your base.</i>

21:36.029 --> 21:39.463
Crowd:

21:39.465 --> 21:41.666
Go, Sasha!

21:41.668 --> 21:43.334
Alright, Sasha!

21:43.336 --> 21:45.503
Man in crowd:
Come on, you got this! Three on.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.838
Crowd:

22:12.064 --> 22:13.631
Umpire:
<i> Ball one!</i>

22:29.981 --> 22:32.783
Umpire:
<i> Ball two.</i>

22:32.785 --> 22:35.019
Coach:
<i> Let's go, ladies!</i>

22:42.928 --> 22:44.495
Umpire:
<i> Ball three!</i>

22:44.497 --> 22:46.364
Coach:
<i> Sasha!</i>

23:03.548 --> 23:07.118
Clifton:
<i> Sasha basañez...</i>

23:07.120 --> 23:09.887
Sounds like some dumbass
baseball player or something.

23:09.889 --> 23:12.156
That's actually a
really good guess.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.992
Oh my god, he is?
Oh, so good!

23:17.896 --> 23:23.834
Except it's softball...
Not baseball.

23:27.539 --> 23:33.811
Shit... yo,
you know shit about sports, bro.

23:33.813 --> 23:36.480
Girls play softball,
Anne.

23:36.482 --> 23:38.649
How do you not know this?

23:38.651 --> 23:41.118
I thought you were supposed
to be like some genius

23:41.120 --> 23:42.720
or some shit.

23:42.722 --> 23:43.954
I'm not a genius.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.623
Ah, damn, I know.
I'm sorry.

23:45.625 --> 23:47.158
I hate it when you call me that.

23:47.160 --> 23:48.793
I know. My bad.
That's my bad.

23:48.795 --> 23:52.029
No, Anne, Anne, Anne...
That's my bad, okay?

23:52.031 --> 23:55.933
I'm sorry. Come here. Come here.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.768
All right, so tell me how...

23:57.770 --> 24:00.871
How you got to kick it with this
dude who's on the baseball team.

24:00.873 --> 24:04.208
So you know senior goodbyes?

24:04.210 --> 24:07.144
No, I'm in yearbook and I've
never heard of senior goodbyes.

24:07.146 --> 24:14.885
Okay. Obviously. So Sasha
basañez bought a senior goodbye.

24:14.887 --> 24:18.489
Uh... and you wanted to do him
because he looked good in a pic,

24:18.491 --> 24:21.025
is that why?

24:21.027 --> 24:23.160
I know it's so lame.

24:23.162 --> 24:25.062
I... I took a camera
along to a game

24:25.064 --> 24:27.064
and I acted like I had
to be there

24:27.066 --> 24:28.833
for like "official yearbook"--

24:28.835 --> 24:30.968
oh, no, no, no, no.
What a stalker, bro.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.870
It's not
exactly "stalker".

24:32.872 --> 24:35.172
"Not exactly stalker"?
You hit him with the cam.

24:35.174 --> 24:37.107
No! Okay. It's kind of stalker.

24:37.109 --> 24:39.977
But we were talking
after the game

24:39.979 --> 24:44.515
and I pretended like
i had to do an interview.

24:48.086 --> 24:49.653
Did you guys fuck or...?

24:49.655 --> 24:52.923
No. Jesus.

24:52.925 --> 24:55.226
You know I've never
done that with anybody.

24:55.228 --> 24:56.961
I'm not like you.

25:00.799 --> 25:02.900
Kiss or...?

25:02.902 --> 25:05.102
No, we talked for like
two seconds.

25:05.104 --> 25:08.873
But, seriously, I've never
felt like this before.

25:08.875 --> 25:10.241
Just like...

25:23.622 --> 25:28.158
It's just like what're
we doing here?

25:28.160 --> 25:31.695
Anne, what are we doing here?

25:31.697 --> 25:34.765
Look, you can't tell me about
you and this other guy, okay?

25:34.767 --> 25:38.869
I'm sorry, that's...
That's just the way it is.

25:38.871 --> 25:42.907
Okay. Uh, just...
Here's where it gets kind of--

25:42.909 --> 25:45.843
you know... you know, right?

25:45.845 --> 25:48.078
Know what?

25:48.080 --> 25:52.182
Oh, come on, you're gonna make
me say it? You know!

25:52.184 --> 25:56.320
Okay, uh, just, look,
let me finish my story?

25:56.322 --> 25:59.790
Okay, can you please...
Can you please just not...

25:59.792 --> 26:02.793
Can you not say anything
for a second?

26:02.795 --> 26:05.796
Please, please,
just don't say anything.

26:08.967 --> 26:12.002
You don't really like
this guy, do you?

26:12.004 --> 26:13.571
Um...

26:13.573 --> 26:16.607
Shh. Never mind.
Don't answer that.

26:47.739 --> 26:49.006
Who is that?

26:49.008 --> 26:50.240
Nobody.

26:50.242 --> 26:51.709
Uhm?

26:54.779 --> 26:57.948
<i> Do you want me to pause it?</i>

26:57.950 --> 26:59.717
Hey!

26:59.719 --> 27:02.186
Hey.

27:02.188 --> 27:03.854
<i> Are you okay?</i>

27:03.856 --> 27:06.924
No.

27:06.926 --> 27:08.158
<i> What's wrong?</i>

27:10.996 --> 27:13.297
I don't know.

27:13.299 --> 27:15.966
Sorry I'm bothering you.

27:15.968 --> 27:17.301
<i> No.</i>

27:17.303 --> 27:21.171
I just totally let everyone
down.

27:21.173 --> 27:23.340
<i> Oh, no.</i>

27:23.342 --> 27:25.409
Sasha:
<i>I was feeling guilty</i>

27:25.411 --> 27:28.045
<i> 'cause I said I didn't care</i>
<i> about any of it anymore.</i>

27:28.047 --> 27:31.882
<i> And then... I shouldn't have</i>
<i> swung but I swung anyway</i>

27:31.884 --> 27:33.384
<i> 'cause I thought--</i>

27:33.386 --> 27:36.687
it's okay. It's okay.
I'm so sure everything is okay.

27:36.689 --> 27:39.289
<i> But I swung anyway</i>
<i> 'cause I thought...</i>

27:39.291 --> 27:41.225
<i>I don't know, I wasn't thinking.</i>

27:41.227 --> 27:46.196
- I wasn't playing smart.
- Sorry...

27:49.968 --> 27:53.837
<i> I'm sure I sound so pathetic</i>
<i> right now.</i>

27:57.042 --> 27:59.810
Can I tell you something?

27:59.812 --> 28:02.346
<i> What?</i>

28:02.348 --> 28:04.348
I don't have a car.

28:07.318 --> 28:11.021
What do you mean?

28:11.023 --> 28:12.289
<i> Remember I said I parked...</i>

28:12.291 --> 28:16.026
...far away. It's 'cause i
walked.

28:18.296 --> 28:21.131
So then why?

28:26.738 --> 28:29.707
I was trying to impress you.

28:40.085 --> 28:42.186
I kind of thought something
was up.

28:42.188 --> 28:43.754
<i> I know.</i>

28:43.756 --> 28:46.356
I kind of felt like you
knew, too.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.260
<i> Le cigarette?</i>

28:50.262 --> 28:53.063
<i> Cigarette?</i>

28:53.065 --> 28:55.199
Oh, oui,<i> le cigarette!</i>

28:55.201 --> 28:57.434
Would you
like a cigarette?

28:57.436 --> 29:00.404
Oh, but of course, I smoke <i> le</i>
<i> cigarette</i> all the time.

33:55.767 --> 33:57.467
No!

34:16.054 --> 34:18.054
Cool bike.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.422
Go fuck yourself.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.628
Dude, I was trying to
compliment you.

34:24.630 --> 34:27.197
Dude, why do you make it
so hard to be your friend?

34:27.199 --> 34:29.132
You don't want to be my friend.

34:29.134 --> 34:31.435
You want to call me a dyke,
which is so dumb

34:31.437 --> 34:33.170
'cause I'm not even gay.

34:33.172 --> 34:35.539
And I know why you do it and you
know that I know.

34:35.541 --> 34:37.174
So don't even pretend.

34:37.176 --> 34:39.842
Wait. Hold up. Pause. Pause,
pause, pause.

34:39.844 --> 34:42.212
You're not gay anymore?

34:42.214 --> 34:44.147
Hey, look,
i just want to know, okay?

34:44.149 --> 34:45.782
Please get out of my way.

34:45.784 --> 34:48.452
I'm just trying to collect
all the facts here.

34:48.454 --> 34:51.554
Okay, here's a fact:
You're a homophobic asshole.

34:57.195 --> 35:01.198
Anne. Anne, come on.
You really think that?

35:01.200 --> 35:04.568
Listen, this is
obviously hard for you.

35:04.570 --> 35:08.538
So if you need to cry again,
like last time,

35:08.540 --> 35:11.441
this is a safe space. Go ahead.

36:02.660 --> 36:06.496
Hm. Just doesn't have
that kid brother ring, huh?

36:06.498 --> 36:08.899
Jesus. What do you want?

36:08.901 --> 36:10.934
I'm declaring a truce.

36:10.936 --> 36:13.370
Then why'd you steal my bike?

36:13.372 --> 36:14.571
What?

36:14.573 --> 36:16.173
Don't be stupid.

36:16.175 --> 36:18.542
Dude, I really don't know what
you're talking about.

36:18.544 --> 36:21.211
'Cause you're an idiot.
Or a liar, or both.

36:21.213 --> 36:23.947
Jesus! Lady, I didn't steal
your precious dyke.

36:23.949 --> 36:26.750
Anne/clifton:
What'd you say?

36:26.752 --> 36:29.953
Aw, come on.

36:29.955 --> 36:31.888
Mr. maldonado...

36:31.890 --> 36:34.524
I know Julie doesn't work
there any more--

36:34.526 --> 36:36.826
Mr. maldonado, can I talk
to you for a second?

36:36.828 --> 36:39.663
...but I... but I explained to
her our printing situation.

36:39.665 --> 36:41.665
Can I please talk to you
for a second?

36:41.667 --> 36:43.700
I'm so sorry.
Can you give me one second?

36:43.702 --> 36:45.402
Is this about you and cliff?

36:45.404 --> 36:46.970
In a manner of speaking, yes.

36:46.972 --> 36:49.406
But it's... it's less about us
than it is just

36:49.408 --> 36:51.675
about generally not letting
people get away with

36:51.677 --> 36:52.943
that kind of thing.

36:52.945 --> 36:54.778
Mr. maldonado:
Okay, let me stop you.

36:54.780 --> 36:56.479
I don't know what kind of drama

36:56.481 --> 36:58.315
you guys have going on
right now,

36:58.317 --> 37:00.817
but I feel like it's better if
you leave me out of it.

37:00.819 --> 37:03.653
I mean, I'm not trying to be
insensitive, okay, I'm not.

37:03.655 --> 37:05.722
But I just feel like
i would only be

37:05.724 --> 37:07.591
a temporary solution, okay?

37:07.593 --> 37:09.259
Do you feel me?

37:11.395 --> 37:12.629
Cliff!

37:12.631 --> 37:13.830
Yeah?

37:13.832 --> 37:15.265
Stop being annoying.

37:15.267 --> 37:16.700
Hello? You still...?

37:16.702 --> 37:19.569
I'm so sorry. Um, it's really
about the...

37:30.615 --> 37:32.315
Clifton:
You know, if you just

37:32.317 --> 37:35.285
apologize to me we could
end this.

37:35.287 --> 37:37.320
Me apologize to you?

37:59.644 --> 38:01.911
Hello?

38:01.913 --> 38:03.747
Yes, this is she.

38:05.583 --> 38:06.850
Uh huh.

38:11.055 --> 38:12.522
Really?

38:14.725 --> 38:17.494
Well, what did he do to her?

38:19.397 --> 38:23.733
Well, I don't think she'd hit
her boyfriend for no reason.

38:23.735 --> 38:27.671
Assistant principal:
<i> Again, ordinarily we'd let the</i>
<i> student finish out the day...</i>

38:27.673 --> 38:30.573
...and not involve the parent,
parents, parent in your case.

38:30.575 --> 38:32.709
But there was a violence
element involved

38:32.711 --> 38:34.511
so we did have
to go ahead and ask

38:34.513 --> 38:36.479
that you come collect
Anne for the day.

38:36.481 --> 38:37.714
Sharon:
Of course.

38:37.716 --> 38:38.948
Clifton:
Um, Ms. wiggins?

38:38.950 --> 38:40.583
Yes?

38:40.585 --> 38:42.886
Is it, uh... is it cool if I go
to the nurse now?

38:42.888 --> 38:44.087
Go ahead.

38:44.089 --> 38:45.989
Thankfully no one was
seriously hurt.

38:45.991 --> 38:48.992
Again, uh, that's a good thing.

38:48.994 --> 38:51.828
I just don't like doing this.

38:51.830 --> 38:54.664
I'd rather have the student
finish off the day but,

38:54.666 --> 38:57.434
you know, because there was a
violence element involved

38:57.436 --> 38:59.903
and the official protocol, um,
is to call the parent

38:59.905 --> 39:01.638
when there is a
violence element,

39:01.640 --> 39:03.973
regardless of the level of the
violence element.

39:03.975 --> 39:06.976
Oh my god, just stop saying
"violence element".

39:06.978 --> 39:08.511
Uh, I'm sorry, Anne--

39:08.513 --> 39:10.113
I'm just saying
nothing happened.

39:10.115 --> 39:12.849
You're a chatsworth valley
panther. Don't forget that.

39:12.851 --> 39:16.686
Anne, apologize right now. Anne.

39:16.688 --> 39:18.955
Sorry.

39:18.957 --> 39:20.390
It's okay.

39:20.392 --> 39:22.359
Temperatures are running
high right now

39:22.361 --> 39:23.593
so I do understand that.

39:23.595 --> 39:25.028
Though, again,

39:25.030 --> 39:27.831
the incident itself was a very
serious offence.

39:27.833 --> 39:31.368
So, I think
it's appropriate that

39:31.370 --> 39:35.872
Anne be suspended from school
for the next three days.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.574
Anne:
Wait. What?

39:37.576 --> 39:40.076
Sharon:
<i> Anne...</i>

39:40.078 --> 39:42.045
Will you tell me what's wrong?

39:42.047 --> 39:43.847
I can tell something's wrong.

39:43.849 --> 39:45.849
Did you guys break
up or something?

39:45.851 --> 39:48.551
No, mom! I told you before that
he's not my boyfriend!

39:48.553 --> 39:51.788
Okay! Then what can I do, honey?

39:51.790 --> 39:56.159
I don't... I mean, you could
start by chilling the fuck out.

39:56.161 --> 39:58.161
Nurse:
<i> Make sure you bring that back.</i>

39:58.163 --> 39:59.763
Clifton:
Yeah, I will.

40:06.537 --> 40:07.771
Sorry.

40:07.773 --> 40:09.005
Please.

40:09.007 --> 40:10.740
Sasha:
I'm just going to yearbook.

40:10.742 --> 40:12.709
Clifton:
Up this way.

40:12.711 --> 40:15.044
Sharon:
<i> Why are you talking to</i>
<i> me like this?</i>

40:15.046 --> 40:18.114
Anne:
<i> 'Cause everything's about you,</i>
<i> isn't it?</i>

40:18.116 --> 40:22.886
I thought you were in
some big hurry.

40:22.888 --> 40:27.624
Fine. If you won't talk to me,
I'm calling Dr. bowman.

40:27.626 --> 40:29.125
Fine. You know, let's do it.

40:29.127 --> 40:31.161
Let's spend a hundred
dollars an hour

40:31.163 --> 40:33.196
so I can cry to
brilliant Dr. bowman

40:33.198 --> 40:36.166
about my poor <i> putika madre</i>
'cause I'm just so sad!

40:36.168 --> 40:37.934
What does that mean?

40:37.936 --> 40:39.469
What?

40:39.471 --> 40:41.471
What does that mean?

40:41.473 --> 40:43.540
What you just said.

40:44.842 --> 40:44.841
Anne,

40:44.843 --> 40:51.481
I know what <i> madre</i> means,
what does <i> putika</i> mean?

40:51.483 --> 40:52.816
Hm?

40:56.220 --> 40:57.821
It means like...

40:59.190 --> 41:02.559
Means like little bitch, little
whore, it's like--

41:07.865 --> 41:09.132
I'm sorry.

41:27.184 --> 41:30.019
Sasha:
Are you going to yearbook, too?

41:30.021 --> 41:32.489
Clifton:
Yep.

41:32.491 --> 41:34.023
Sasha:
Great.

41:34.025 --> 41:37.527
I guess I'll just keep
following you then.

41:40.931 --> 41:42.799
Hold up, pause, pause, pause.

41:45.203 --> 41:47.203
Uh, we should...

41:47.205 --> 41:50.507
You're Sasha basañez.

41:50.509 --> 41:52.242
Yeah.

41:52.244 --> 41:54.177
You're gonna see Anne.

41:54.179 --> 41:56.012
How did you know that?

41:56.014 --> 42:00.116
Did she say something
about me?

42:00.118 --> 42:02.151
You're really pretty.

42:57.041 --> 42:59.342
Ms. totally checking
herself out--

42:59.344 --> 43:01.277
oh my god, hi! Hey!

43:01.279 --> 43:04.314
How's you? How are you?
How are you, Sasha?

43:04.316 --> 43:08.685
Good. Good. How's you?

43:08.687 --> 43:12.021
Good. I'm good.

43:12.023 --> 43:14.357
Okay.

43:14.359 --> 43:16.092
We should--

43:16.094 --> 43:17.594
yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:22.900 --> 43:26.703
So, hey, I, uh... I have a
humble request of you.

43:26.705 --> 43:27.904
Sasha:
Yeah?

43:27.906 --> 43:29.606
Can I stay at your place?

43:29.608 --> 43:32.141
Um, I just like really don't
want to go home tonight.

43:32.143 --> 43:34.978
Yeah. Sure.

43:34.980 --> 43:37.146
You look awesome.

43:37.148 --> 43:39.849
Yeah? I don't know.

43:39.851 --> 43:43.820
I wish I was like...
Like that, you know.

43:43.822 --> 43:45.922
Instead it's like... buhhh.

43:45.924 --> 43:51.194
What? No. Here, put this on
right now.

43:52.896 --> 43:56.866
Here, put this on.
Put it on, seriously.

44:02.206 --> 44:03.706
Whoa.

44:05.409 --> 44:06.876
Hm. Do I look stupid?

44:06.878 --> 44:09.112
You look amazing.

44:09.114 --> 44:12.248
It's depressing me how
good it looks.

44:12.250 --> 44:13.950
Oh, I don't know.

44:13.952 --> 44:16.352
That weird girl is like wearing
the exact same one.

44:16.354 --> 44:18.087
Who?

44:18.089 --> 44:22.125
Er, no. Don't look
at her. Just...

44:22.127 --> 44:26.029
It's that girl. I don't know.

44:26.031 --> 44:29.098
She's kind of weird.

44:39.309 --> 44:41.411
Oh, guess who asked
me out today?

44:41.413 --> 44:42.912
Who?

44:42.914 --> 44:45.415
Cliff Martinez.

44:45.417 --> 44:46.816
What?

44:46.818 --> 44:48.251
He was just like,

44:48.253 --> 44:51.954
"hey, you're pretty. You want to
go get frozen yogurt?"

44:51.956 --> 44:55.091
I, uh, didn't know that you guys
knew each other.

44:55.093 --> 44:57.093
Hm.

44:57.095 --> 44:59.162
You're not mad, are you?

45:00.731 --> 45:02.865
Or, do you like him?

45:10.841 --> 45:12.475
Hey, I was supposed
to drop this off.

45:12.477 --> 45:13.943
Oh, I'll take care of it.

45:13.945 --> 45:15.144
Thank you.

45:15.146 --> 45:17.947
<i> Hey, cliff!</i>

45:17.949 --> 45:19.315
What's good, Mr. q?

45:19.317 --> 45:21.784
Come here, let's talk.

45:21.786 --> 45:24.220
Yeah, I just gotta, um,
go live my life.

45:24.222 --> 45:25.855
No, no, no. It's not a debate.

45:25.857 --> 45:27.857
Let's go.

45:27.859 --> 45:30.793
What? Why?

45:30.795 --> 45:34.797
Oh, because I like you.
I want to see you succeed.

45:34.799 --> 45:37.967
Oh, gross! You like "like" me?

45:37.969 --> 45:42.038
Oh, I like you so much.
Here, take a seat.

45:45.876 --> 45:48.411
Ooh, and you're all
touching me and stuff?

45:48.413 --> 45:50.246
This how you talk to
the other kids?

45:50.248 --> 45:52.448
Aw, I don't really talk
to the other kids.

45:52.450 --> 45:53.850
I don't really like them.

45:53.852 --> 45:55.218
Shit...

46:01.258 --> 46:04.260
Um, no. Those go off.

46:08.066 --> 46:11.400
So, uh... tell me,
what'd you do?

46:13.137 --> 46:15.271
What?

46:15.273 --> 46:18.241
Come on. I know this whole
thing's your fault.

46:18.243 --> 46:21.244
I'm gonna let that one
go 'cause I like you.

46:21.246 --> 46:23.913
Come on, man.

46:23.915 --> 46:25.815
Listen, my back is killing me.

46:25.817 --> 46:28.084
I wanna go home,
you wanna go home.

46:28.086 --> 46:30.787
Can we just cut the crap,
you tell me what's going on?

46:30.789 --> 46:32.155
Dude, why do you care so much?

46:32.157 --> 46:34.223
Well, why do you care
about Anne so much?

46:34.225 --> 46:36.058
Dude, why you always gotta be

46:36.060 --> 46:38.327
answering a question with a
question, man?

46:38.329 --> 46:42.031
That's what they teach me in
guidance counselor school.

46:42.033 --> 46:43.266
Yeah?

46:43.268 --> 46:45.001
Come on. Tell me.

46:45.003 --> 46:47.270
Between you and me. Come on.

46:52.276 --> 46:54.043
It's just like,

46:54.045 --> 46:57.980
it's like there's no way
she'll forgive me.

46:57.982 --> 47:01.184
Forgive you for what?

47:01.186 --> 47:03.586
I mean, not "forgive"
'cause I didn't do anything.

47:05.956 --> 47:08.090
Well, have you ever
thought of saying sorry

47:08.092 --> 47:12.228
for this mysterious thing that
you can't tell me about?

47:12.230 --> 47:14.964
Kinda.

47:14.966 --> 47:17.366
"Kinda". So, no.

47:20.437 --> 47:23.973
Dude, whatever you did that

47:23.975 --> 47:28.477
you think you can't come back
from, you probably can.

47:30.848 --> 47:34.984
Never underestimate the human
capacity for forgiveness.

47:40.224 --> 47:41.591
What?

47:49.099 --> 47:50.967
All right.

47:50.969 --> 47:53.970
All right, yo, Mr. q, you gotta
keep this on the low, okay?

47:53.972 --> 47:55.304
You gotta promise.

47:55.306 --> 47:56.873
Okay. Yeah, listen,

47:56.875 --> 47:59.342
whatever you say in this room
stays in this room.

47:59.344 --> 48:00.076
You swear?

48:00.078 --> 48:01.544
I swear.

48:01.546 --> 48:03.913
I need you to swear on your
mother. Honestly.

48:03.915 --> 48:06.182
Honestly, I swear on my mother.

48:09.152 --> 48:12.388
Sit down and tell me
what's going on.

48:18.262 --> 48:20.997
You don't really like
this guy, do you?

48:20.999 --> 48:22.265
Um...

48:22.267 --> 48:25.167
Sh. Never mind.
Don't answer that.

48:53.363 --> 48:54.563
Oh, god...

48:54.565 --> 48:56.132
Cliff...

48:56.134 --> 48:59.468
Oh, god. Yo, take this off.

48:59.470 --> 49:02.204
Take it off. Take it off.

49:17.554 --> 49:19.021
Here.

49:25.162 --> 49:26.429
Oh, fuck...

49:26.431 --> 49:28.130
Okay.

49:53.590 --> 49:56.392
Oh...

50:11.074 --> 50:12.508
Are you on the pill?

50:12.510 --> 50:15.111
What?

50:15.113 --> 50:17.013
Are you on the pill?

50:21.218 --> 50:22.485
Cliff. Cliff...

50:22.487 --> 50:24.487
What? What?

50:26.289 --> 50:29.325
Ah, are you fucking serious
right now...

50:29.327 --> 50:32.762
Oh, shit, you gotta be
kidding me right now...

50:48.145 --> 50:50.679
Fuck...

50:58.789 --> 51:00.389
You okay?

51:03.460 --> 51:04.794
No.

51:08.198 --> 51:10.299
Did it hurt?

51:13.537 --> 51:15.104
You can tell me. I'll listen.

51:17.674 --> 51:22.678
I know the fucking difference
between softball and baseball.

51:22.680 --> 51:25.748
Oh, hey, hey. Yo, yo,
chill, chill, chill.

51:25.750 --> 51:30.686
You need me to say it? Look,
i like you, okay, whatever?

51:30.688 --> 51:33.823
Just... please, just
stop talking.

51:33.825 --> 51:36.826
Why are you being
a dick right now?

51:36.828 --> 51:39.662
I'm being a dick?
You're being a dick.

51:39.664 --> 51:41.263
Please don't call me a dick!

51:41.265 --> 51:42.631
Fuck, okay, chill.

51:42.633 --> 51:46.235
Just don't storm out of here
like some crazy bitch.

51:46.237 --> 51:48.471
Don't call me a bitch!

51:48.473 --> 51:53.742
Fine. Okay. Like a crazy young
lady or whatever...

51:53.744 --> 51:57.113
I don't...
Why are you being so mean to me?

51:57.115 --> 52:02.284
I thought you were supposed to
be... the only person that...

52:03.453 --> 52:04.787
Fuck this!

52:04.789 --> 52:06.222
Whoa, whoa, come on, Anne!

52:06.224 --> 52:07.456
Anne! Come on, what,

52:07.458 --> 52:09.492
you're gonna walk
out of your own house?

52:09.494 --> 52:11.360
Sasha is a girl! Okay?

52:11.362 --> 52:13.362
I don't like you like that.
I just don't!

52:13.364 --> 52:15.231
I don't like you like that!

52:15.233 --> 52:18.134
Sasha basañez is a girl and she
plays softball

52:18.136 --> 52:19.401
and I wanna fuck her!

52:19.403 --> 52:21.270
I don't wanna fuck you!

52:32.215 --> 52:37.286
Are you
kidding me right now?

52:37.288 --> 52:38.854
It's the truth.

52:41.558 --> 52:42.858
What?

52:47.931 --> 52:50.866
Oh... shit.

52:52.435 --> 52:55.337
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

52:55.339 --> 52:56.572
Cliff...

53:01.344 --> 53:03.646
Cliff, what can I do?

53:08.185 --> 53:11.787
Was that
just to mess me up?

53:14.758 --> 53:18.594
Mess up your friend before you
go off running with some dyke?

53:18.596 --> 53:20.696
Cliff, that is so unfair.

53:20.698 --> 53:22.531
"Cliff, that is so unfair."

53:22.533 --> 53:24.400
What the fuck is the
matter with you?

53:24.402 --> 53:27.403
"What the fuck is the matter
with you, cliff?"

53:27.405 --> 53:30.606
I can't believe that
you're mad at me.

53:30.608 --> 53:32.541
You're the one fucking
leading me on!

53:32.543 --> 53:34.476
I am not leading you on.

53:34.478 --> 53:36.946
Oh, please!

53:36.948 --> 53:39.715
How many times have we been on
the couch together, like,

53:39.717 --> 53:42.885
all... all spooning and
snuggling and shit?

53:42.887 --> 53:45.721
I come over every fucking day.

53:47.524 --> 53:53.429
Dyke. I can't believe all this
fucking time I wasted on you.

54:00.570 --> 54:01.870
Fuck you!

54:03.240 --> 54:05.874
Oh, fuck me? Fuck me?

54:05.876 --> 54:07.309
Yeah, fuck you!

54:07.311 --> 54:11.580
No! No, fuck you! No, fuck you!

54:11.582 --> 54:13.549
Anne:
This is my house!
Get the fuck out!

54:13.551 --> 54:14.817
Fuck!

54:25.362 --> 54:27.563
She... so she didn't
want to have sex,

54:27.565 --> 54:29.632
is that what you're saying?

54:35.505 --> 54:39.375
Cliff, do you feel like maybe

54:39.377 --> 54:42.778
you had sex with Anne
against her will?

54:52.455 --> 54:54.056
I don't know.

54:54.058 --> 54:55.457
Clifton:
<i> Fuck you!</i>

54:56.661 --> 54:58.594
<i> Fuck you!</i>

55:30.394 --> 55:34.897
Rita:
<i> Hey, guys. I'm coming in...</i>

55:34.899 --> 55:38.534
Oh... look at you
two lucky girls.

55:38.536 --> 55:42.871
Sleep-over on a
school night? Yay!

55:42.873 --> 55:45.708
Anne, you called your mom and
she said it was okay, right?

55:45.710 --> 55:47.009
Yeah.

55:47.011 --> 55:48.911
Yeah? Okay...

55:50.847 --> 55:55.351
Well, don't stay up too late.

55:55.353 --> 55:56.652
Good night.

55:56.654 --> 55:58.087
Good night, mom.

56:13.069 --> 56:14.603
All right.

56:47.504 --> 56:50.773
It seems like you've
done this before.

56:54.412 --> 56:56.412
So what's your name?

56:56.414 --> 56:57.679
Maria.

56:57.681 --> 56:58.981
All right.

56:58.983 --> 57:01.016
So are you guys here like every
night or--

57:01.018 --> 57:02.584
oh, every night. Every night.

57:02.586 --> 57:04.086
I live here.

57:04.088 --> 57:06.889
I've got a sleeping bag and i
set it up right over there.

57:19.068 --> 57:20.502
That would be my phone!

57:20.504 --> 57:21.804
I'm giving you my number.

57:21.806 --> 57:24.206
Bop beep, beep boop beep.

57:24.208 --> 57:26.041
Hello?

57:26.043 --> 57:27.876
Oh, it's for you.

57:33.883 --> 57:35.150
Beer's gross, right?

57:35.152 --> 57:36.652
God. Yeah.

57:36.654 --> 57:38.187
Yeah. Here! Pure sugar.

57:38.189 --> 57:39.955
Okay.

57:49.065 --> 57:50.699
Sorry!

58:31.975 --> 58:35.978
Sasha:
Hey. Don't look at them.

59:39.976 --> 59:43.011
I have to go to the bathroom.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:19.114
Don't tell anybody.

01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:20.716
About what?

01:00:23.853 --> 01:00:26.121
I'm really drunk.

01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:27.956
No, you're not.

01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:33.395
Promise you won't say anything.

01:00:33.397 --> 01:00:36.231
Why would I tell anyone?

01:00:36.233 --> 01:00:39.401
I don't know. I don't know you.

01:00:39.403 --> 01:00:42.704
I don't know,
like, what you're about.

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.941
You don't know me?

01:00:45.943 --> 01:00:47.342
No.

01:00:49.112 --> 01:00:50.746
Hey...

01:00:53.016 --> 01:00:54.383
Hey.

01:00:59.089 --> 01:01:01.857
Talk to me, please?

01:01:03.192 --> 01:01:08.196
Please. Please. Hey. Talk to me.

01:01:11.801 --> 01:01:13.702
I'm not like you.

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:18.373
You're so confident.

01:01:18.375 --> 01:01:25.280
Me? I'm not. I'm...
I'm really, really not.

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:31.887
I don't know what I'm doing,
either, at all.

01:02:03.219 --> 01:02:07.489
Sasha:
Anne... Anne. We gotta go.

01:02:34.151 --> 01:02:35.350
Come on.

01:02:35.352 --> 01:02:36.918
Yeah.

01:03:04.013 --> 01:03:05.547
Bye!

01:03:19.328 --> 01:03:21.163
Manuela:
<i> Clifton!</i>

01:03:23.934 --> 01:03:25.367
<i> Clifton!</i>

01:03:29.972 --> 01:03:32.941
Manuela:

01:03:41.584 --> 01:03:43.018
Whoa.

01:03:44.587 --> 01:03:51.092
Um, I've decided that I'm cool
with us "going out".

01:03:51.094 --> 01:03:54.396
Oh yeah, that's, uh...
That's fine with me.

01:03:54.398 --> 01:03:58.934
You can tell whoever you want
I'm your boyfriend.

01:03:58.936 --> 01:04:01.069
Um, what does that mean?

01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:07.275
Look, I know. Okay?

01:04:07.277 --> 01:04:10.045
Anne's like my best friend.

01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:17.252
Anne? That yearbook girl,
what about her?

01:04:17.254 --> 01:04:19.554
You guys aren't a thing?

01:04:44.248 --> 01:04:45.647
Sasha!

01:04:45.649 --> 01:04:47.549
Girl:
Come on, Sasha.

01:04:47.551 --> 01:04:50.285
Hey, Sasha!

01:04:50.287 --> 01:04:52.621
Hey! Can we talk for a second?

01:04:52.623 --> 01:04:54.222
Hey, you're in yearbook, right?

01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:56.157
Is it too late to buy
a senior goodbye?

01:04:56.159 --> 01:04:57.359
Yeah, it's too late.

01:04:57.361 --> 01:04:58.560
Frick, I knew it.

01:04:58.562 --> 01:05:01.263
Can we um... yeah,
can we talk?

01:05:01.265 --> 01:05:02.530
Okay.

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:07.302
Maybe alone,
for a second?

01:05:07.304 --> 01:05:10.305
Okay.

01:05:10.307 --> 01:05:12.007
That was weird.

01:05:14.176 --> 01:05:19.014
So? So...

01:05:20.283 --> 01:05:23.351
Would you like a
cigarette?

01:05:25.322 --> 01:05:27.522
I mean, like what's
going on with us?

01:05:27.524 --> 01:05:30.225
I've sent you like a
billion texts.

01:05:30.227 --> 01:05:34.529
Um, I don't know,
you wanted to talk to me?

01:05:36.999 --> 01:05:40.402
You're talking to me like...
Like you don't know me.

01:05:40.404 --> 01:05:42.103
Oh, I know you.

01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:43.605
So then say something.

01:05:43.607 --> 01:05:46.408
What do you want me to say?

01:05:46.410 --> 01:05:50.111
I don't know.
I... I just like...

01:05:50.113 --> 01:05:53.648
You know, I felt like we should
talk. I don't know, obviously.

01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:57.085
Well, we're talking.
Here we are.

01:05:59.989 --> 01:06:02.157
Um, I'm gonna go.

01:06:04.393 --> 01:06:07.629
I, look, I... fuck it.

01:06:10.299 --> 01:06:11.666
I like you!

01:06:16.305 --> 01:06:18.473
I like-like you.

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:22.677
I was thinking, you know,
it's just like,

01:06:22.679 --> 01:06:24.312
why be weird about it?

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:26.348
Let's just keep
hanging out and...

01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:30.218
And go out with each other
or whatever.

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:33.655
You and me... please.

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.327
Sorry, um...

01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:42.664
I'm not gay.

01:06:46.369 --> 01:06:49.604
Um, but good luck with that.

01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:53.274
Sorry.

01:06:53.276 --> 01:06:54.676
Girl:
What was that all about?

01:06:54.678 --> 01:06:56.244
I don't know.

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:45.527
Students:
Speech! Speech!
Speech!

01:07:45.529 --> 01:07:48.096
Mr. maldonado:
Hey! You guys
remember this, huh?

01:07:48.098 --> 01:07:49.697
Students:
Booo!

01:07:49.699 --> 01:07:54.269
Haha! Remember that?
Well, say goodbye!

01:07:54.271 --> 01:07:57.205
Yeah!

01:07:57.207 --> 01:07:58.506
Woo! That felt good, right?

01:07:58.508 --> 01:08:00.275
Uh, so, you know,

01:08:00.277 --> 01:08:02.744
I want to start thinking about
next year, fundraising,

01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:04.145
what kind of themes?

01:08:04.147 --> 01:08:05.480
But, for now, you know what?

01:08:05.482 --> 01:08:07.649
Let's say goodbye to
the paper copy.

01:08:07.651 --> 01:08:11.252
And hit me with the drive,
our finished product!

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:15.256
Look at this space-case. Cliff.

01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:17.158
Cliffito! Cliff!

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:18.859
Cliff, hit me with the drive.

01:08:18.862 --> 01:08:22.197
I hit... it was a big intro,
"hit me with the drive!"

01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:24.799
Oh, my bad.

01:08:24.801 --> 01:08:27.569
Here it is, everybody, the
fruits of our labour!

01:08:31.241 --> 01:08:33.575
Girl:
What're we gonna do for the
rest of the year?

01:08:33.577 --> 01:08:35.510
Boy:
We're not gonna do Jack!

01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:36.845
Mr. maldonado:
You wish!

01:08:36.846 --> 01:08:38.580
We're gonna do book reports.

01:08:56.765 --> 01:08:58.867
Anne:
<i> Cliff.</i>

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:00.502
Give me the drive.

01:09:04.406 --> 01:09:05.840
Why?

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:07.709
Just give it to me.

01:09:07.711 --> 01:09:10.478
You gonna do somethin' stupid?

01:11:41.864 --> 01:11:43.464
Hello?

01:11:45.768 --> 01:11:47.802
Yes, this is she.

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:50.571
Hey!

01:11:50.573 --> 01:11:51.973
Just wanted to say hello--

01:11:51.975 --> 01:11:53.641
excuse me! Hi.

01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:54.876
Hi.

01:11:54.878 --> 01:11:56.477
I was told to see--

01:11:56.479 --> 01:12:00.815
oh, good, you're here.
This way, please.

01:12:06.355 --> 01:12:07.922
Rita:
<i> I understand</i>

01:12:07.924 --> 01:12:10.325
<i>but I'm talking about something</i>
<i> different here.</i>

01:12:10.327 --> 01:12:11.759
<i> I'm talking about a plan--</i>

01:12:11.761 --> 01:12:13.528
Mr. q:
<i> I'd just rather not</i>
<i> repeat all this.</i>

01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:14.962
Sharon:
What's going on?

01:12:14.964 --> 01:12:16.931
Assistant principal:
Please have a seat.

01:12:16.933 --> 01:12:18.866
Okay, so we're all here.

01:12:18.868 --> 01:12:21.703
Uh, so there have been quite a
few accusations and rumours

01:12:21.705 --> 01:12:23.705
and accusations flying
around everywhere.

01:12:23.707 --> 01:12:26.574
So, um, we did have to, uh,

01:12:26.576 --> 01:12:29.410
get everyone together here
before things got out of hand,

01:12:29.412 --> 01:12:31.846
and shed some light on the
issues at hand.

01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:33.815
This is, again,
a very serious matter

01:12:33.817 --> 01:12:35.683
so I did go ahead and bring in

01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:37.852
our guidance counsellor,
Mr. quibodeaux.

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:40.521
So I will let him take
it from here.

01:12:40.523 --> 01:12:43.524
Right. So Clifton Martinez has

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:46.394
already admitted to putting the
picture in the...

01:12:46.396 --> 01:12:47.895
In the yearbook.

01:12:47.897 --> 01:12:51.499
And, uh, he... there will be...
He will be disciplined.

01:12:51.501 --> 01:12:55.036
Mr. maldonado:
He is definitely off yearbook
next year, that's for damn sure.

01:12:55.038 --> 01:12:56.604
Nooo.

01:12:56.606 --> 01:12:59.073
Manuela/clifton:

01:12:59.075 --> 01:13:01.409
So, uh... so what I'm
hoping we can do

01:13:01.411 --> 01:13:06.047
is come to some kind of amicable
agreement between Mrs...

01:13:06.049 --> 01:13:07.648
Basañez.

01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:11.652
...basañez and cliff and
Sharon...

01:13:11.654 --> 01:13:13.988
I'm not... I'm sorry, I don't
know your last name--

01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:16.457
first, we need to talk about
solutions.

01:13:16.459 --> 01:13:18.559
I'd like to know how we're gonna
fix this,

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:20.128
that's what I would
like to know.

01:13:20.130 --> 01:13:21.896
Who can tell me a plan?

01:13:21.898 --> 01:13:24.399
Mr. maldonado:
Ma'am, there's no plan per se.

01:13:24.401 --> 01:13:27.001
We've already spent thousands of
dollars in printing,

01:13:27.003 --> 01:13:29.637
we've sold hundreds
of copies of the yearbook,

01:13:29.639 --> 01:13:31.472
there's no possible way--

01:13:31.474 --> 01:13:34.142
just tell everybody to bring it
back. How hard can that be?

01:13:34.144 --> 01:13:35.910
How hard can that...?
They're kids.

01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:37.712
If you tell them to
bring it back

01:13:37.714 --> 01:13:39.514
they're going
to hold onto it more.

01:13:39.516 --> 01:13:42.116
Josh. If this was something
truly egregious, I get it,

01:13:42.118 --> 01:13:44.185
but it's just a silly
little picture.

01:13:44.187 --> 01:13:45.853
Rita:
A silly picture?

01:13:45.855 --> 01:13:48.756
Excuse me. What picture are we
talking about?

01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:50.958
Rita:
What picture? That's perfect.

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:54.529
Anne, you haven't talked
to your mom about this?

01:13:59.435 --> 01:14:00.968
Jesus!

01:14:00.970 --> 01:14:03.171
Not to intrude but I think
the issue at hand,

01:14:03.173 --> 01:14:05.206
apart from the
questionable content,

01:14:05.208 --> 01:14:07.041
which is fine, actually,

01:14:07.043 --> 01:14:10.144
is whether or not PDA should be
allowed in the yearbook,

01:14:10.146 --> 01:14:13.014
regardless of gender or
personal expression.

01:14:13.016 --> 01:14:14.715
Clifton:
What about lovebirds?

01:14:14.717 --> 01:14:17.652
The whole kissing booth
thing at prom?

01:14:17.654 --> 01:14:19.220
Mr. q:
This is a little different--

01:14:19.222 --> 01:14:21.155
all these straight
people making out?

01:14:21.157 --> 01:14:23.224
That's a little different,
they're groping.

01:14:23.226 --> 01:14:25.193
Y'all are just
a bunch of homophobes.

01:14:25.195 --> 01:14:27.061
You know what,
who is in charge here?

01:14:27.063 --> 01:14:28.629
Who has the most authority?

01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:30.097
That would be me, technically.

01:14:30.099 --> 01:14:31.632
Okay, ma'am.

01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:33.201
If you don't make sure that each

01:14:33.203 --> 01:14:35.937
and every one of those books
that you've already sold,

01:14:35.939 --> 01:14:37.538
if they're not returned,

01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:39.707
then this is going to
become a police matter.

01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:41.476
Whoa.

01:14:41.478 --> 01:14:44.078
We will certainly look into the
feasibility of that.

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:45.947
But for the time being...

01:14:45.949 --> 01:14:49.116
We will refund you the money for
the senior goodbye and we will,

01:14:49.118 --> 01:14:50.918
uh, print a corrections page.

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:52.687
You think we care
about the money?

01:14:52.689 --> 01:14:54.021
Well, I'm not saying that--

01:14:54.023 --> 01:14:55.790
Sasha.

01:14:55.792 --> 01:14:58.192
Rita:
Tell them. Tell them
what you told us.

01:14:58.194 --> 01:14:59.694
It's okay.

01:15:02.732 --> 01:15:08.636
Honey, it's okay.
No one's going to hurt you.

01:15:08.638 --> 01:15:10.805
I'm right here.

01:15:10.807 --> 01:15:12.773
Tell them.

01:15:17.279 --> 01:15:19.013
I didn't want her to kiss me.

01:15:19.015 --> 01:15:20.948
What?

01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:23.951
Rita:
And what did you tell that girl?
What did you tell her?

01:15:23.953 --> 01:15:25.152
Sasha:
I told her to stop.

01:15:25.154 --> 01:15:26.587
Anne:
No!

01:15:26.589 --> 01:15:28.055
Sasha:
I said stop. Stop. I said it.

01:15:28.057 --> 01:15:29.991
No, mom, I...
No, I didn't do that, i--

01:15:29.993 --> 01:15:31.826
assistant principal:
Hold on a minute.

01:15:31.828 --> 01:15:33.828
Mr. q:
Okay, I'm not sure this is--

01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:35.663
okay, I'm not
comfortable with this.

01:15:35.665 --> 01:15:37.832
I feel like my daughter is being
accused of something here.

01:15:37.834 --> 01:15:40.001
- No, that wasn't--
- Anne, don't say anything.

01:15:40.003 --> 01:15:41.302
They were both drinking,

01:15:41.304 --> 01:15:43.638
that's why she could take
advantage of her.

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:45.039
All right. One thing at a time.

01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:46.941
My daughter is not even gay,
ask her--

01:15:46.943 --> 01:15:49.110
excuse me.
Honey, what's your name?

01:15:49.112 --> 01:15:50.745
Rita:
Her name is Sasha.

01:15:50.747 --> 01:15:52.246
That's how little you know

01:15:52.248 --> 01:15:54.215
what's going on in
your own daughter's life

01:15:54.217 --> 01:15:56.150
you don't even know
the name of--

01:15:56.152 --> 01:15:59.020
Sasha? Sasha? Are you doing this
because you're scared?

01:15:59.022 --> 01:16:00.621
Are you afraid right now?

01:16:00.623 --> 01:16:02.590
Is that why you're saying
these things--

01:16:02.592 --> 01:16:05.293
she's not the one on trial here.
She's not the one on trial.

01:16:05.295 --> 01:16:06.761
Listen, no one is on trial.

01:16:06.763 --> 01:16:08.663
She's the one who did
something wrong!

01:16:08.665 --> 01:16:11.232
And Sasha said stop and
she didn't stop.

01:16:11.234 --> 01:16:14.201
Yeah, but did she want
her to stop?

01:16:14.203 --> 01:16:15.636
Cliff...

01:16:15.638 --> 01:16:16.837
No, this is bullshit!

01:16:16.839 --> 01:16:18.039
Shh. Shh. Calm down.

01:16:18.041 --> 01:16:19.340
Okay, she keeps saying,

01:16:19.342 --> 01:16:21.342
"i told her to stop.
I told her."

01:16:21.344 --> 01:16:24.145
Everybody in the whole...
In the whole school

01:16:24.147 --> 01:16:27.248
knows that these two
hooked up, okay?

01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:30.051
And then she's all...

01:16:30.053 --> 01:16:33.087
Like that shit's for real.

01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:35.590
You know what I mean,
like that's some real shit.

01:16:37.226 --> 01:16:40.628
Mr. q:
I think what cliff is trying to
say, if we can--

01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:44.699
yo. Yo, you gotta be real now.

01:16:44.701 --> 01:16:47.702
On what happened. You have to.

01:16:49.004 --> 01:16:50.237
I was drunk.

01:16:50.239 --> 01:16:51.639
Clifton;
Oh, come on.

01:16:51.641 --> 01:16:53.040
You know, this is ridiculous.

01:16:53.042 --> 01:16:54.942
This should really be
a police matter.

01:16:54.944 --> 01:16:56.644
Clifton:
Are you fucking blind?!

01:16:56.646 --> 01:16:58.045
She's on the softball team!

01:16:59.616 --> 01:17:00.915
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:17:00.917 --> 01:17:03.918
Hey! Can everybody be quiet!

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:05.753
Thank you.

01:17:05.755 --> 01:17:09.357
Now, Sasha... Sasha, it's...

01:17:09.359 --> 01:17:13.160
It's very, very important that
you tell the truth.

01:17:13.162 --> 01:17:15.129
You understand why?

01:17:17.065 --> 01:17:20.701
Mr. q:
Now, did Anne
do something with you

01:17:20.703 --> 01:17:23.638
that you didn't want her to do?

01:17:49.297 --> 01:17:50.931
I don't know.

01:17:55.704 --> 01:17:57.004
Come on.

01:17:57.006 --> 01:17:58.806
Ma'am, if you just...

01:17:58.808 --> 01:18:00.174
Uh uh.

01:18:00.176 --> 01:18:02.076
Mr. q:
Um...

01:18:02.078 --> 01:18:04.311
Sharon:
If you have anything else
to say to me,

01:18:04.313 --> 01:18:06.147
you should do it in writing.

01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:09.684
She's scared. That's why she's
not saying anything.

01:18:09.686 --> 01:18:12.353
All of you ganging up on her.

01:18:12.355 --> 01:18:15.823
You know, you should really be
ashamed of yourself.

01:18:17.125 --> 01:18:18.959
Both of you.

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:26.300
Come on, baby.

01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:55.890
Anne?

01:19:57.058 --> 01:19:59.860
Anne, I made dinner.

01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:05.332
Come on, let's eat.

01:20:05.334 --> 01:20:08.102
<i> I'm not hungry.</i>

01:20:08.104 --> 01:20:10.004
Just eat a little.

01:20:56.952 --> 01:20:59.386
Eduardo, you going on break?

01:20:59.388 --> 01:21:01.288
Yeah, is that cool?

01:21:01.290 --> 01:21:03.991
Absolutely. Just have Benny
watch the register, please?

01:21:03.993 --> 01:21:05.226
Sasha?

01:21:06.628 --> 01:21:08.529
That's me.

01:21:08.531 --> 01:21:10.364
Okay, so the test is
super effective.

01:21:10.366 --> 01:21:12.032
But I'm also going to ask you

01:21:12.034 --> 01:21:14.034
some questions about your
sexual history

01:21:14.036 --> 01:21:18.405
and factor that in before we
come to a diagnosis.

01:21:18.407 --> 01:21:21.308
So let's just talk about the
last three years.

01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:24.144
Number of sexual partners you've
had, that sort of thing.

01:21:24.146 --> 01:21:30.584
Um, the first one was
this guy, my friend.

01:21:30.586 --> 01:21:32.419
That was my first time.

01:21:32.421 --> 01:21:36.223
But he's had sex before, so he's
the one that I'm worried about.

01:21:36.225 --> 01:21:37.558
Uh huh.

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:43.030
Um, and the second one...
This is weird.

01:21:43.032 --> 01:21:46.200
It's alright.
Just go for it.

01:21:50.338 --> 01:21:53.140
I met this guy.

01:21:53.142 --> 01:21:59.413
I don't even know his name, it's
just like cool guy from bar.

01:21:59.415 --> 01:22:01.548
It was the second time
that I met him.

01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:03.584
I don't know, he...
He took me outside

01:22:03.586 --> 01:22:08.155
and I don't know why i
agreed to go, but I did.

01:22:08.157 --> 01:22:13.227
Oh, god, you must just
think I'm like some stupid slut.

01:22:13.229 --> 01:22:16.563
No. I'm not here to judge.

01:22:16.565 --> 01:22:19.667
Okay. Um, here goes.

01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:23.404
So, basically,
he took out his dick

01:22:23.406 --> 01:22:26.507
and he wanted me to give
him a blow job

01:22:26.509 --> 01:22:28.575
and I was like, "fuck that."

01:22:28.577 --> 01:22:35.316
So he like took my hand and kind
of jerked himself off with it.

01:22:35.318 --> 01:22:39.253
And then he splooged all over my
favourite jeans.

01:22:42.557 --> 01:22:45.192
I know, I... I'm...
I'm being really paranoid.

01:22:45.194 --> 01:22:46.460
It's stupid.

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:48.162
No, I'm glad you brought
this up.

01:22:48.164 --> 01:22:50.164
Um, since that happened
have you noticed

01:22:50.166 --> 01:22:51.498
any changes in your body?

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:53.500
Like itching or burning?

01:22:53.502 --> 01:22:55.970
No.

01:22:55.972 --> 01:22:57.338
Okay.

01:22:57.340 --> 01:23:00.007
Well, um, your test results
are negative

01:23:00.009 --> 01:23:03.577
for the HIV antibody.
So you're good.

01:23:05.413 --> 01:23:06.714
That's it?

01:23:06.716 --> 01:23:08.515
Yeah, that's it.

01:23:10.218 --> 01:23:12.619
I don't have the
twenty-five dollars.

01:23:12.621 --> 01:23:16.156
I know the sign says that the
suggested donation--

01:23:16.158 --> 01:23:17.391
oh, it's okay.

01:23:17.393 --> 01:23:18.659
No, I...

01:23:18.661 --> 01:23:20.761
Here, I have...
I have twenty-three--

01:23:20.763 --> 01:23:24.164
you can just buy something in
the store if you want to.

01:23:27.369 --> 01:23:30.437
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:23:33.675 --> 01:23:37.678
I'm just gonna sit here...
For a second.

01:23:47.055 --> 01:23:48.288
It's okay.

01:23:49.557 --> 01:23:51.125
Sit.

01:23:52.794 --> 01:23:55.729
I'm gonna sit here with you.

01:24:00.101 --> 01:24:01.602
I don't why I did that,
you know.

01:24:01.604 --> 01:24:04.538
I... I went out of my way
to do something

01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:07.508
that I didn't want to do at all.

01:24:09.644 --> 01:24:12.312
Maybe you were upset
about something?

01:24:12.314 --> 01:24:13.580
Yeah.

01:24:14.816 --> 01:24:16.650
Okay.

01:24:16.652 --> 01:24:19.253
What were you upset about?

01:24:23.591 --> 01:24:24.825
This girl.

01:24:26.194 --> 01:24:28.729
Okay.

01:24:28.731 --> 01:24:30.597
What's her name?

01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:34.301
Sasha.

01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:36.804
Hah.

01:24:41.509 --> 01:24:43.844
Why were you upset about Sasha?

01:25:31.192 --> 01:25:34.161
Anne. Anne.

01:25:45.607 --> 01:25:50.410
My name's not Sasha.
My name is Anne.

01:25:55.650 --> 01:25:59.586
And I'm... totally gay.
