That he's Scott's father.

00:32.958 --> 00:35.208
Why are you
so determined
to destroy him?

00:35.208 --> 00:38.333
D'Ken has
destroyed millions
in his quest for power.

00:38.333 --> 00:41.083
One of those

my wife.

on our harboring a fugitive

Fine. Don't help.

I won't believe it!

better explain
yourself quickly.

It was
your family
you sacrificed!

away so you could go
knock around the galaxy!

am I making this up?

not like everything

on board, living or dead.

09:09.250 --> 09:11.250

09:11.250 --> 09:14.083
Why did no one notice
when he ejected the witness?

09:15.291 --> 09:19.083
Twenty years ago we
were flying home from
a camping trip in Alaska.

09:19.083 --> 09:21.125
You, your brother,
your mother and I.

09:21.125 --> 09:23.583
I was flying our old
De Havilland Mosquito,

09:23.583 --> 09:26.583
when a starcraft
began shadowing
us from above.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.000
It opened fire.

09:29.708 --> 09:32.833
We only had seconds before
the fuel tanks were gonna
blow!

09:36.083 --> 09:38.833
The flames had destroyed
all our parachutes but one.

09:38.833 --> 09:41.375
I strapped you
into that chute,

09:41.375 --> 09:44.000
and we tied little
Alex into your arms.

09:46.583 --> 09:50.958
Your mother and I
said what we thought would
be our last goodbyes to you.

09:54.375 --> 09:56.583
We pushed you to safety,
watching after you,

09:56.583 --> 09:59.333
praying you'd make
it down all right.

09:59.333 --> 10:03.458
But as your
parachute began to
burn, we had little hope.

10:05.083 --> 10:07.458
Just as our
fuel tanks went,

10:07.458 --> 10:10.125
your mother
and I were transported
into the attacker's ship.

10:10.125 --> 10:11.750
Imprisoned,

10:12.250 --> 10:16.375
collected as biological
specimens for the Shi'ar.

10:16.375 --> 10:17.583
It looked hopeless.

10:18.250 --> 10:22.125
Until the Starjammer
crew sprung us loose.

10:22.125 --> 10:23.958
What happened to my mother?

10:23.958 --> 10:29.458
Destroyed before my eyes
by the Shi'ar tyrant D'Ken.

10:29.458 --> 10:32.625
The monster you X-Men and
the Phoenix helped me defeat.

10:32.625 --> 10:37.625
As far as I knew,
my entire family
was gone.

10:38.583 --> 10:40.583
I had no reason to go home.

10:45.583 --> 10:47.750
I think these
belong to you.

10:53.458 --> 10:56.833
If you'd known Alex
and I were still alive...

10:56.833 --> 11:01.875

could have stopped me from
finding you!

they want to play it.

RAKNAR: X-Men, I do not know
what Corsair told you to
gain your support.

12:07.875 --> 12:10.000
The witness he abducted
knows the location

12:10.000 --> 12:12.583
of the Lord Chamberlain's
horded fortune.

12:12.583 --> 12:13.583
Big mouth!

12:15.500 --> 12:18.708
Corsair wants the girl
so she can lead him
to the money.

12:18.708 --> 12:22.208
Anything else
he told you is
a self-serving lie.

12:23.458 --> 12:24.708
Is this true?

12:27.125 --> 12:30.000
I saved Jandra
because I care
about her.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.583
But I also have
a starship to
maintain,

12:32.583 --> 12:34.875
and fusion fuel
doesn't come cheap!

12:34.875 --> 12:38.500
You mean we're out
here fighting the Shi'ar
police so you can get rich?

you're not
listening to me!

12:42.208 --> 12:43.708

12:43.708 --> 12:45.000
For all I know,
the Lord Chamberlain

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
hired you to
kill the witness!

12:47.000 --> 12:51.833
Storm, find Jandra
and keep her safe.
From everybody!

12:52.333 --> 12:53.708

find out the truth.

and then we'll talk.

The galaxy is in
your debt, Cyclops.

13:39.583 --> 13:42.083
I have agreed to nothing.

13:42.083 --> 13:45.083
When we get the girl,
we'll see who's lying.

13:45.083 --> 13:47.708
This is Cyclops.

toward the location

beacon light
we saw coming in.

13:52.333 --> 13:55.750
Nothing yet.
Wait a minute.

13:57.583 --> 13:59.958
I may
have picked
up their trail.

but I can't allow
you to interfere.

Corsair, what a pleasure
to see you looking so well.

14:52.333 --> 14:55.458
I need to know
how you learned
that I am the one

14:55.458 --> 14:59.000
the Lord Chamberlain
hired to dispose of
the witness.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.125
I don't betray friends
to murderers like you.

15:02.125 --> 15:05.000
That's what I was hoping
you would say.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.875
STORM: Why
do you Starjammers
treat me as an enemy?

15:10.125 --> 15:13.833
Did we not
fight side-by-side
against the tyrant D'Ken?

15:13.833 --> 15:17.250
True. Though
we have maintained
communications silence,

15:17.250 --> 15:21.166
Corsair's open communicator
allowed us to hear everything.

15:21.166 --> 15:23.375
Including
Cyclops-son

15:23.375 --> 15:27.125
betraying
Corsair-father
to evil Commander!

like enemy, not Starjammers!

I am glad you are back.
But why is the lady tied up?

15:40.333 --> 15:44.125
Her friend
betrayed our location to
the false Shi'ar officer.

15:44.125 --> 15:47.875
On the other hand,
from the lies
Cyclops was told,

15:47.875 --> 15:50.291
it is no more
than we expected.

16:25.750 --> 16:28.958

was programed in
advance

16:28.958 --> 16:31.458
to cover up
what was really
going to be a murder!

16:31.458 --> 16:34.250
Exactly. I went to
your father for help,

16:34.250 --> 16:36.583
because
he was the one man
I knew with the guts

16:36.583 --> 16:39.875
to rescue Jandra
and see that
justice was done.

16:39.875 --> 16:41.625
Until I ruined it.

16:41.625 --> 16:45.125
My mistake could cost
all of you your lives.

16:45.125 --> 16:49.625
We'll see.
For now, just try to have
a little faith in your father.

16:50.083 --> 16:52.416
I gave orders
that I wasn't
to be...

16:52.416 --> 16:53.958
Disturbed?

17:00.291 --> 17:03.875
That's the Scott Summers
I gave my last parachute
to!

17:03.875 --> 17:05.458
Took you long enough!

17:05.458 --> 17:08.000
Plan the family picnic later.
Let's go!

17:10.416 --> 17:11.583
Follow me!

17:20.125 --> 17:23.500
CH'OD:
Corsair, sorry to break
communications silence,

17:23.500 --> 17:27.875
but I strongly suggest
you alter your course
13 degrees to the north.

17:27.875 --> 17:31.708
Fools! We have them now.

17:31.708 --> 17:34.458
CH'OD:
And remember
Aldebaran 5.

17:34.458 --> 17:36.458
I remember it well.

17:36.458 --> 17:39.458
STORM:
Professor Xavier
sends his regards.

17:39.458 --> 17:44.416
Xavier is half-a-planet away,
and Aldebaran is in another
galaxy.

17:44.416 --> 17:46.000
What are they up to?

17:56.625 --> 17:58.083
(CHEERING)

18:02.458 --> 18:04.875
I don't know what happened
on Aldebaran 5,

18:04.875 --> 18:06.416
but it better
have been good.

18:06.416 --> 18:07.583
It was.

18:14.166 --> 18:15.708
(CORSAIR MOANS IN PAIN)

18:24.625 --> 18:25.958
Now!

18:25.958 --> 18:30.250
Let power pour from the sky.

18:30.250 --> 18:31.333
Fire!

18:59.250 --> 19:00.708
(LAUGHING)

19:01.708 --> 19:05.166
You'll have
to forgive Ch'od.
He gets carried away.

19:05.166 --> 19:06.833
That's okay, Dad.

19:06.833 --> 19:09.000
I think
I understand
how he's feeling.

19:11.500 --> 19:14.583
Get up here, everyone!
We have a trial to get to!

19:14.583 --> 19:17.958
And a renegade cop
to turn over to
Shi'ar justice.

19:18.583 --> 19:20.083
CORSAIR:
What made you
change your mind?

19:20.083 --> 19:22.750
Let's just say
I like long odds.

19:22.750 --> 19:24.625
Seems to run
in the family.

19:24.625 --> 19:26.708
Our talk got interrupted.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.166
There's so much
I want to know.

19:29.166 --> 19:31.708
We'll get to it. All of it.

19:32.208 --> 19:34.250
I've got
a question
or two myself.

19:34.250 --> 19:35.333
Then stay!

19:35.333 --> 19:36.750
What?

19:36.750 --> 19:39.833
I don't mean forever.
Just a few hours.

19:39.833 --> 19:42.625
You're not
telling me your hot
spacecraft can't make up

19:42.625 --> 19:45.416
a few hours
flying across
a whole galaxy!

19:45.416 --> 19:46.500
Well, I...

19:47.500 --> 19:51.208
I guess we could spend
a little extra time in
hyperdrive.

19:51.208 --> 19:54.708
Oh, no. Break out the cards!

19:54.708 --> 19:56.250
Better save your fuel.

19:56.250 --> 19:58.083
Looks like we're
going to be here
a while.

20:00.416 --> 20:02.875
So, you're gonna
marry that redhead

20:02.875 --> 20:05.208
that beat the pants
off of the Imperial
Guard.

20:05.208 --> 20:08.000
CYCLOPS: She's calmed down
a bit since then.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.833
Reminds me
a lot of your mother.

20:09.833 --> 20:11.166
CYCLOPS: How?

20:12.333 --> 20:15.583
CORSAIR: Maybe I should wait
to tell you till after
you're married.
