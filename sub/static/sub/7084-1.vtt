01:07.147 --> 01:08.857
Lookie here.

01:08.941 --> 01:11.569
My day is made.

01:11.652 --> 01:15.614
I didn't even finish breakfast
and I get to kill me a stinkin' Injun.

01:17.032 --> 01:18.033
Injun?

01:19.117 --> 01:20.535
Nah.

01:20.619 --> 01:24.247
I just dress like this so's I don't get
scalped out on the prairie.

01:24.331 --> 01:27.375
Oh, well, that's a convincing outfit.

01:27.459 --> 01:30.838
Yeah, you can't be too safe out there...

01:30.921 --> 01:33.465
with all of them savages runnin' around.

01:33.548 --> 01:35.342
So, what can I do you for?

01:35.425 --> 01:38.637
Need some flour.
Five sacks.

01:38.721 --> 01:41.974
And a carrot with peanut butter on it.

01:42.057 --> 01:43.559
Now, what's that gonna run me?

01:43.642 --> 01:46.562
Well, sack of flour's 45 cents.

01:46.645 --> 01:48.897
So, five sacks...

01:50.649 --> 01:51.942
is 40...

01:52.025 --> 01:53.736
Wanna get back to me on that?

01:54.570 --> 01:55.779
Yeah, look...

01:55.863 --> 01:57.489
Now, the flour's in the basement.

01:57.573 --> 01:59.783
You can fetch it yourself.

01:59.867 --> 02:00.909
Much obliged.

02:19.552 --> 02:21.889
Well, lookie what we got here.

02:22.472 --> 02:26.226
Sweet piece of red prairie meat
out all by her lonesome.

02:27.144 --> 02:30.939
- What do you make of that, Nelly?
- Oh, I think she's waiting on you, Will.

02:35.068 --> 02:36.528
- Go on, get on it.
- It's on now.

02:36.612 --> 02:37.905
- Yeah.
- Go get her, Will.

02:37.988 --> 02:38.989
Oh, oh, oh.

02:39.072 --> 02:40.323
Here we go.

02:41.366 --> 02:46.664
Now, you must be wondering why five badass
<i>hombres</i> with perfect jawlines...

02:49.541 --> 02:52.878
all sport the same stylish eye patch.

02:52.961 --> 02:54.922
Not my business.

02:55.005 --> 02:59.467
We all carved our eyeballs
out our skull

02:59.551 --> 03:03.013
to show how devoted
we are to this gang.

03:03.096 --> 03:04.347
We the Left-Eye Boys!

03:06.474 --> 03:07.976
Yeah!

03:09.477 --> 03:10.645
Hey!

03:10.729 --> 03:13.523
You got real pretty eyes, miss.

03:13.606 --> 03:15.734
You reckon we can,
I don't know, borrow one?

03:15.818 --> 03:17.820
Can we borrow one?

03:22.908 --> 03:25.660
Now, is that a proper question
to ask a lady?

03:25.744 --> 03:28.789
Who are you, slick?
The boyfriend?

03:30.540 --> 03:32.084
Soon to be the husband.

03:34.127 --> 03:37.422
Oh, wait a minute!
That's a white boy under that getup.

03:37.505 --> 03:40.300
That's a white boy? Oh, shit.

03:40.383 --> 03:43.595
You partial to pale faces, Poca-hot-tits?

03:43.679 --> 03:44.680
Huh?

03:44.763 --> 03:47.224
'Cause I can show you
what a real white man's like.

03:47.307 --> 03:50.686
- Yeah, show her, Will. Yeah, go on.
- Yeah, shuffle up, Will.

03:50.769 --> 03:52.187
- Dance now, boy.
- Shuffle on over.

03:52.270 --> 03:54.940
- There you go.
- That's some white boy shit right there.

03:55.023 --> 03:56.775
Now, I do want to carve my eyes out.

03:56.859 --> 03:58.401
- What'd you say?
- Hey, fellers...

03:58.485 --> 04:01.446
I'd hit the trail before you get hurt.

04:02.155 --> 04:04.324
Before we get hurt?

04:04.407 --> 04:06.994
Before we get hurt.

04:07.077 --> 04:11.039
I think you've been smokin' too much
of that peace pipe, kemo-slobby.

04:11.123 --> 04:14.584
Now, from what I see, there's one of you,

04:14.667 --> 04:17.004
and there's five of us.

04:22.843 --> 04:23.844
Four of you.

04:24.636 --> 04:25.678
What just happened?

04:25.763 --> 04:27.055
You wanna see it again?

04:27.139 --> 04:29.892
Uh... yes.

04:40.986 --> 04:43.280
- I don't like this shit.
- Shut up.

04:44.072 --> 04:47.492
Well, that's some, uh...
real fancy footwork.

04:48.201 --> 04:52.330
But I think this hullabaloo has escalated
to the firearms stage.

05:00.588 --> 05:03.675
Boys, let's ventilate this.

05:25.697 --> 05:28.450
What the shit that just happened?

05:35.916 --> 05:40.253
What the hell?
What in the hell?

05:44.382 --> 05:46.844
"Hit the trail."
It was so simple.

05:48.011 --> 05:51.389
You must stop doing this, White Knife.
One day, there will be too many.

05:51.473 --> 05:53.600
But not today, Smoking Fox.

05:53.683 --> 05:56.603
Please, my love...
we must go.

05:57.187 --> 05:59.397
What the hell
happened out here?

05:59.481 --> 06:01.691
Injuns.
They went that way.

06:01.774 --> 06:03.401
You ain't no white man.

06:03.485 --> 06:06.696
You're that orphan, White Knife.

06:06.779 --> 06:10.408
Raised like an animal with those Apaches.

06:10.492 --> 06:12.577
You think you can fool ol' Clem?

06:12.660 --> 06:13.786
Sorry, Ringo.

06:13.871 --> 06:17.832
Well, now I'm gonna shoot you
and your Injun whore.

06:17.916 --> 06:19.084
Gotta cut breakfast short.

06:24.214 --> 06:26.549
You suck, mister!

06:27.342 --> 06:29.344
You suck!

06:31.889 --> 06:34.224
What are you?

06:56.955 --> 06:58.415
Yes, White Knife.

06:58.498 --> 06:59.749
Go, White Knife.

07:04.129 --> 07:06.173
Yay!

07:06.256 --> 07:07.883
You lucky, Smoking Fox.

07:07.966 --> 07:11.053
White Knife all man.
Bravest of all braves.

07:12.387 --> 07:14.472
Not brave. Foolish.

07:14.556 --> 07:16.934
I want to be wife, not widow.

07:21.813 --> 07:23.065
Afternoon, ladies.

07:29.404 --> 07:30.822
This is Apache land.

07:30.906 --> 07:33.616
I'm not here to take your land, Chief.

07:33.700 --> 07:36.619
I'm just looking for a particular boy.

07:37.745 --> 07:39.497
I'm Frank Stockburn.

07:40.748 --> 07:42.292
This boy's mother was my wife.

07:43.793 --> 07:45.253
And the boy, Tommy...

07:46.338 --> 07:47.839
he's my son.

08:02.395 --> 08:05.148
It is wise to be slow to trust,
White Knife.

08:05.232 --> 08:08.568
But every new journey begins
with a single step.

08:09.652 --> 08:11.404
Speak with your father.

08:12.405 --> 08:14.574
But you are my father,
Screaming Eagle.

08:15.575 --> 08:16.952
Ever since my mother...

08:18.495 --> 08:20.998
Ever since you found me...

08:21.081 --> 08:23.333
you taught me to hunt,
to fight...

08:23.416 --> 08:26.544
when to speak and when to be silent.

08:26.628 --> 08:28.838
- To be a man.
- A good man.

08:28.921 --> 08:30.548
And this Frank Stockburn,

08:30.632 --> 08:34.094
he is filled with lies,
just like every other white man.

08:34.594 --> 08:37.889
Sometimes, the white man speaks the truth.

08:37.972 --> 08:40.683
Like, one in 20, 25 times.

08:42.059 --> 08:44.479
I believe this is one of those times.

08:46.231 --> 08:47.983
He knew your mother, White Knife.

08:48.066 --> 08:51.944
Maybe he can give you some peace.
Talk to him.

08:52.029 --> 08:54.614
Maybe after I close my eyes to dream.

09:16.803 --> 09:19.556
Mommy!

09:45.748 --> 09:47.125
Oh, no.

09:52.630 --> 09:58.178
One look at me, and you knew your old man
had done a lot of bad things, didn't ya?

09:58.261 --> 10:01.723
I cheated men, I killed men...

10:02.890 --> 10:06.144
So I deserve whatever's comin' to me.

10:07.979 --> 10:11.816
The only one that ever saw any good in me
was your mother.

10:15.528 --> 10:16.571
Oh!

10:16.654 --> 10:18.156
Why have you come here?

10:18.823 --> 10:22.369
Not a man for chitchat, huh?

10:23.411 --> 10:25.538
Well, me neither.

10:26.664 --> 10:29.041
Kid, I'm dying...

10:30.168 --> 10:31.628
of consumption.

10:35.673 --> 10:37.425
Don't worry...

10:37.509 --> 10:42.639
I'm not looking
for no big father-son hoo-ah.

10:43.223 --> 10:44.224
"I love you, son."

10:44.307 --> 10:46.017
"I love you too, Daddy."

10:51.731 --> 10:52.940
No.

10:54.817 --> 10:58.821
I've come for a more tangible reason.

11:03.075 --> 11:08.373
Tommy, I've been stealing from folks
since I was nine years old...

11:09.249 --> 11:14.587
and that's the way I've amassed
a good little fortune.

11:15.046 --> 11:18.300
I wanna do something
decent with it.

11:20.051 --> 11:22.220
I want to give it to you, son.

11:26.933 --> 11:28.476
I don't want your money.

11:29.936 --> 11:32.146
But maybe you could give...

11:32.230 --> 11:36.609
$50,000 to these nice Injuns
who raised you.

11:36.693 --> 11:37.902
We'll take it.

11:39.070 --> 11:40.154
Go back to bed.

11:40.697 --> 11:41.781
Sorry.

11:41.864 --> 11:43.658
Seriously, though,
we'll take it.

11:43.741 --> 11:47.204
Look, it's buried in the meadow
just up the trail,

11:47.287 --> 11:49.372
next to a big ol' pine tree.

11:49.456 --> 11:51.833
What do you say
we go dig it up in the morning

11:51.916 --> 11:54.919
and start playing Santa Claus?

11:56.087 --> 11:58.673
I don't remember much about my mother...

11:59.674 --> 12:02.219
but I do remember her telling me...

12:04.262 --> 12:05.638
you were dead.

12:10.852 --> 12:13.438
Maybe it was because...

12:13.521 --> 12:16.858
she didn't want
you to come looking for me.

12:16.941 --> 12:19.026
She was a smart lady.

12:20.194 --> 12:24.156
Only stupid thing she ever did
was fall for me.

12:24.949 --> 12:26.784
Meeting Betty Dunson...

12:27.452 --> 12:30.663
was the luckiest thing
that ever happened to me.

12:33.791 --> 12:37.086
From the first day I laid eyes on her...

12:37.754 --> 12:40.006
she was bawlin' out this...

12:40.089 --> 12:45.011
half-drunk, big ol' burly blacksmith...

12:45.094 --> 12:47.639
down at Silver Canyon.

12:48.473 --> 12:50.808
She's been the only one, Tommy.

12:57.982 --> 12:59.526
Mom had a temper?

13:00.443 --> 13:05.573
Temper?
When she got her dander up, look out.

13:05.657 --> 13:07.492
We was in a saloon once.

13:07.575 --> 13:09.744
This fellow sitting next to her

13:09.827 --> 13:14.832
starts talking about the perfect way
to make a cherry pie...

13:15.917 --> 13:19.712
So your mom says to me,
"Frank, come here a minute.

13:19.796 --> 13:23.550
Tell me again,
just where did you get them flowers?"

13:23.633 --> 13:27.679
I said, "I know that you think
I stole them from the graveyard."

13:29.514 --> 13:31.516
Good morning, boys.

13:32.434 --> 13:34.018
Morning, Never Wears Bra.

13:34.101 --> 13:36.938
I had dream about you last night,
White Knife.

13:37.021 --> 13:38.856
Oh, that's nice.

13:38.940 --> 13:40.191
Not nice dream.

13:40.733 --> 13:43.403
In dream, you naughty.

13:43.486 --> 13:45.613
You naughty, White Knife.

13:45.697 --> 13:47.949
Mmm, somebody's got an admirer.

13:48.032 --> 13:50.076
Yes, yes.

13:50.159 --> 13:53.162
But like you,
there's only one woman for me.

13:57.625 --> 14:00.337
I guess we Stockburns are...

14:00.420 --> 14:02.171
partial to the sweet ones.

14:02.254 --> 14:03.631
Yes, sir.

14:03.715 --> 14:05.508
Like your mother.

14:07.844 --> 14:10.304
How did she die, Tommy?

14:11.473 --> 14:12.682
You tell me?

14:13.766 --> 14:19.731
Well, there were these big kids at school
fixin' to beat me up.

14:21.358 --> 14:25.778
Instead of facing them myself,
I had her walk me there.

14:26.654 --> 14:28.865
This feller comes out of nowhere...

14:29.741 --> 14:32.577
walks right up to her and shoots her dead.

14:34.329 --> 14:37.624
So that's how she died,
protecting her gutless son

14:37.707 --> 14:41.794
instead of being home,
safe where she belonged.

14:47.467 --> 14:50.094
Who's that?
Is that Bony Express?

14:50.762 --> 14:53.055
Bony Express
don't come around here.

14:55.099 --> 14:56.643
Giddyap!

15:09.906 --> 15:11.073
He's here somewhere, boys.

15:11.157 --> 15:12.367
Let's burn him out!

15:13.951 --> 15:14.994
Oh...

15:15.077 --> 15:16.996
Next one goes through your forehead.

15:17.872 --> 15:20.833
Hey, hey!
No need to burn nothing, boys!

15:20.917 --> 15:22.919
Howdy, boss.

15:23.002 --> 15:24.128
Cicero...

15:25.588 --> 15:29.133
you're not gonna let a man
enjoy his retirement, are ya?

15:29.216 --> 15:33.763
No, Frank, I salute your decision
to turn from your sinful ways.

15:33.846 --> 15:35.598
But the money...

15:35.682 --> 15:37.392
that belongs to all of us.

15:37.475 --> 15:38.810
Touch that steel, boy,

15:38.893 --> 15:42.063
I got plenty of bullets left over
after I put one in...

15:45.024 --> 15:46.025
your father.

15:47.902 --> 15:50.988
Oh, you finally found your long lost son.

15:51.072 --> 15:54.409
Well, I sure hate to break up
this nice family reunion.

15:54.492 --> 15:57.787
So, why don't you give us
the money you stole

15:57.870 --> 16:00.665
before I put lead in your head.

16:06.754 --> 16:07.964
The money's buried.

16:08.548 --> 16:10.257
Way to run your mouth, son.

16:10.341 --> 16:11.759
It's buried?

16:11.843 --> 16:13.595
Yeah, I buried it.

16:13.678 --> 16:17.181
Deep in the ground...
next to a windmill.

16:17.264 --> 16:19.559
A windmill in the West...

16:19.642 --> 16:21.769
doesn't narrow it down much, Frank.

16:21.853 --> 16:24.230
Well, this is a special windmill.

16:25.314 --> 16:27.024
It's a singing windmill.

16:28.985 --> 16:30.402
A singing windmill!

16:32.989 --> 16:35.700
It's about a ten-day ride from here.

16:35.783 --> 16:38.828
I'll lead you to it presently
on one condition.

16:39.454 --> 16:41.247
You don't hurt my boy...

16:41.330 --> 16:44.751
or any of these kindly Injuns here.

16:46.418 --> 16:47.879
Let's ride, Frank.

16:59.932 --> 17:03.435
Frank, if that $50,000
isn't under that windmill,

17:03.520 --> 17:05.229
I'm gonna bury you up to your neck

17:05.311 --> 17:07.898
and let the desert critters eat you alive.

17:07.982 --> 17:10.358
It's there, Cicero, it's there.

17:10.442 --> 17:14.155
I'm glad I got to meet Betty Dunson's son.

17:15.031 --> 17:17.324
You just stay here, Tommy.

17:17.407 --> 17:19.743
Enjoy your life
with your beautiful bride...

17:20.787 --> 17:24.874
amongst these majestic pine trees.

17:26.667 --> 17:28.210
Let's go!

17:49.148 --> 17:51.609
Well, that was uncool.

18:01.828 --> 18:04.080
White Knife, you must rest.

18:04.163 --> 18:05.623
How can I rest?

18:05.707 --> 18:09.376
When they get to the singing windmill
and find no money, they will kill him.

18:09.460 --> 18:13.756
My son, there are too many trees
and too little time.

18:14.924 --> 18:18.427
Then I must get this $50,000 another way.

18:18.510 --> 18:22.431
How? By stealing?
There is no honor in that.

18:23.265 --> 18:27.854
Unless I steal from those
who have no honor.

18:27.937 --> 18:31.148
Ooh... I like that.

18:31.232 --> 18:33.150
But it is too dangerous.

18:33.234 --> 18:35.695
I will send ten of our
strongest braves with you.

18:35.778 --> 18:37.113
No.

18:37.196 --> 18:40.241
The braves would be treated too cruelly
in the white man's world.

18:40.324 --> 18:42.534
A lot of them can pass for pale face.

18:42.619 --> 18:45.830
Raging Bear can actually do
a great impression of a white guy.

18:46.497 --> 18:49.876
Hey, guys, let's play with our chest hair
and eat potato chips.

18:52.670 --> 18:55.381
Wasn't that great?
Where does he come up with this stuff?

18:55.464 --> 18:59.218
That's very good, Bear,
but I must walk this path alone.

19:00.511 --> 19:04.140
My love...
I will get this money...

19:04.223 --> 19:06.517
bring it to the singing windmill,

19:06.601 --> 19:08.686
and be back in time for our wedding.

19:09.145 --> 19:10.647
I won't let you go.

19:11.606 --> 19:12.899
Those men are killers.

19:13.399 --> 19:17.278
I was a coward once
and my mother paid the price.

19:18.738 --> 19:21.616
That will not happen to my father.

19:39.425 --> 19:40.426
Whoa!

19:40.509 --> 19:42.679
Good morning.

19:42.762 --> 19:44.596
Where in the hell did you come from?

19:44.681 --> 19:46.766
I'm in a bit of a bind, boys.

19:46.849 --> 19:49.644
I rode all the way out here
to pan for gold

19:49.727 --> 19:51.771
and my horse up and died on me.

19:51.854 --> 19:53.355
How'd he die?

19:53.439 --> 19:55.066
Suicide.

19:55.149 --> 19:56.943
Drowned himself.

19:57.026 --> 20:00.404
Put his head in the stream
and just kept it there.

20:00.487 --> 20:02.073
Saddest thing you ever seen.

20:02.824 --> 20:04.075
It happens.

20:04.158 --> 20:07.119
Powers that be don't like to admit it,
but it happens.

20:07.912 --> 20:09.371
He looks like an honest white guy.

20:10.164 --> 20:11.207
Hop on.

20:12.041 --> 20:13.125
Much obliged.

20:14.210 --> 20:16.545
Just drop me off
at the nearest town.

20:22.969 --> 20:24.178
Ladies and gentlemen,
gather around.

20:24.261 --> 20:27.348
Hear the wondrous effects
of Dr. Chubb's Vita Oil,

20:27.431 --> 20:29.809
the miracle cure for 1001 ailments.

20:29.892 --> 20:31.728
Put the pep back in your...

20:32.353 --> 20:33.520
Who's this asshole?

20:47.785 --> 20:51.247
Well, now, look at this fella,
drinking from the horse trough.

20:51.330 --> 20:52.331
Excuse me.

20:53.791 --> 20:54.834
You there!

20:56.252 --> 20:58.963
What you're doing is disgusting.

20:59.046 --> 21:01.382
That water is for our filthy horses.

21:01.465 --> 21:05.762
Water flows from the sky spirit
for all its children.

21:05.845 --> 21:07.054
Isn't that right, cousin?

21:07.138 --> 21:11.100
We don't cotton to that peyote-smoking
nonsense around these parts.

21:11.183 --> 21:13.144
Do you hear me, "cousin"?

21:14.561 --> 21:17.481
Okay, William, come on back.

21:17.564 --> 21:19.025
Hey, <i>amigo.</i>

21:19.942 --> 21:21.652
You planning on staying in town?

21:22.569 --> 21:25.114
Might need a place
to lay my head for a bit.

21:33.372 --> 21:36.333
Sorry about that ugly man
that insulted you.

21:36.417 --> 21:40.546
He runs the bank, so he thinks
he's entitled to be mean to everyone.

21:40.629 --> 21:42.506
There's a bank in this town?

21:42.589 --> 21:44.300
Why? You wanna rob it?

21:44.383 --> 21:47.594
I look like a bank robber to you, ma'am?

21:47.678 --> 21:52.599
Funny, there's something about you that
reminds me of a certain bank robber.

21:53.225 --> 21:55.144
His name was Frank Stockburn.

21:56.520 --> 21:58.605
You know Frank Stockburn?

21:58.689 --> 22:00.775
"Know"? Like, in the biblical sense?

22:00.858 --> 22:04.278
No, ma'am.
You've met him before is what I'm asking.

22:04.361 --> 22:06.738
Yes, I met him.

22:06.823 --> 22:08.282
Then, 20 minutes later,

22:08.365 --> 22:11.828
I knew him in the biblical sense
on that bed, right there.

22:11.911 --> 22:12.912
Oh.

22:12.995 --> 22:17.875
And, I knew him, in the biblical sense,
twice on this railing.

22:17.959 --> 22:18.960
Uh-huh.

22:19.043 --> 22:23.380
And then, while doing a handstand
on that dresser you're leaning against.

22:25.716 --> 22:29.178
Did he happen to mention
a singing windmill?

22:29.261 --> 22:32.098
He did mention a singing windmill.

22:32.181 --> 22:35.059
He said it sounded like a choir of angels.

22:35.142 --> 22:36.853
Where'd he say it was?

22:36.936 --> 22:41.941
He said that it was in a place
where he made his biggest score.

22:42.024 --> 22:44.068
Whatever that was.

22:44.151 --> 22:45.402
And then he laughed.

22:45.486 --> 22:47.696
He liked to laugh...

22:47.779 --> 22:49.781
and have handstand sex.

22:49.866 --> 22:51.742
Yeah, we gotta get past that.

22:51.825 --> 22:53.077
I miss him.

22:53.160 --> 22:55.121
But he did leave me something
to remember him by.

22:55.204 --> 22:56.580
What's this?

22:56.663 --> 23:00.084
A <i>niño,</i> Ramon.

23:01.252 --> 23:03.295
I have a brother?

23:03.379 --> 23:07.341
Oh, Burro, we had many adventures
together, you and me.

23:07.424 --> 23:08.926
We're not getting any younger.

23:10.386 --> 23:13.097
At least we have our memories.

23:14.932 --> 23:18.895
Remember the two girls,
the sisters, in Deadwood?

23:18.978 --> 23:20.271
You liked the fat one.

23:22.023 --> 23:23.607
You know it's true.

23:23.690 --> 23:25.192
Ramon Lopez?

23:26.235 --> 23:27.528
<i>Sí.</i>

23:28.445 --> 23:33.325
I just came from conversating
with your mother, Esmerelda.

23:34.326 --> 23:38.330
We stumbled upon the fact that
your dad and my dad...

23:39.957 --> 23:41.667
are the same fella.

23:42.334 --> 23:43.835
Oh, that's neat.

23:44.461 --> 23:45.587
Yeah.

23:45.671 --> 23:47.881
Same father.

23:47.965 --> 23:50.051
Half-brothers.

23:50.134 --> 23:52.094
What do you think about that, Burro?

23:54.430 --> 23:55.806
So, how is Dad?

23:55.889 --> 23:58.976
Well, he went and got himself kidnapped,

23:59.060 --> 24:02.896
and I need to come up with $50,000
to save his life.

24:03.772 --> 24:05.357
That's a lot of pesos.

24:05.441 --> 24:06.567
Sure is.

24:07.484 --> 24:10.862
That's why I'm fixin'
to rob the bank here in town.

24:12.031 --> 24:13.199
Hang on.

24:14.366 --> 24:16.868
My father is in trouble.

24:16.953 --> 24:19.871
My brother, he needs my help.

24:21.498 --> 24:23.584
I'll rob the bank with you.

24:23.667 --> 24:25.586
I must do this alone.

24:28.422 --> 24:30.216
What's happening right now?

24:32.009 --> 24:34.220
Ever since I'm <i>pequeño,</i>

24:34.303 --> 24:39.058
I dream about spending
one magical day with <i>mi padre,</i>

24:39.141 --> 24:43.020
sharing meals,
introducing him to the burro.

24:45.147 --> 24:48.900
I will not let go of you
until you say I can help you.

24:55.282 --> 24:58.619
Will you stop brushing me
if I say yes?

24:58.702 --> 24:59.786
Yes.

25:01.747 --> 25:03.207
Then you can help.

25:16.595 --> 25:18.764
That means he likes you.

25:36.823 --> 25:39.701
That's a good amount of money
you want us to lend you.

25:39.785 --> 25:42.829
Now, normally, we would require
two forms of identification, madam,

25:42.913 --> 25:45.874
but that won't be necessary in your case.

25:45.957 --> 25:48.877
I feel kinda guilty about this, Burro,

25:48.960 --> 25:50.796
taking money from nice people.

25:50.879 --> 25:53.215
I mean, it's not like
you're some greasy Mexican.

25:55.134 --> 25:56.593
I feel less guilty now.

25:58.512 --> 26:00.389
What are you doing?

26:00.472 --> 26:02.391
This is a bank!

26:02.474 --> 26:04.226
Get that donkey out of here!

26:04.310 --> 26:06.019
It is a burro, <i>señor.</i>

26:06.103 --> 26:08.897
I don't care, <i>"señor."</i>
Get it out!

26:08.980 --> 26:10.732
All right.
<i>Vámonos.</i>

26:13.069 --> 26:14.611
The burro don't want to <i>vámonos.</i>

26:14.695 --> 26:18.574
Well, I don't really care
what the burro wants.

26:21.493 --> 26:24.538
Get out of my bank, you beast!

26:24.621 --> 26:27.083
I know what you're thinking,
but not yet.

26:27.166 --> 26:28.459
Hold it.

26:28.542 --> 26:30.461
Move!

26:41.930 --> 26:44.475
How is this jackass stuck?

26:44.558 --> 26:47.353
If it got in here,
it can certainly get out!

26:47.436 --> 26:50.147
It doesn't make sense,
it's not logical.

26:51.440 --> 26:53.150
They got it locked up good,
do they?

26:53.234 --> 26:56.570
Oh! You are leaving!

27:00.199 --> 27:03.119
Gall dang,
he felled on his pooper!

27:16.715 --> 27:19.050
- That makes no sense!
- I apologize.

27:19.135 --> 27:21.470
- I don't know how many times I could...
- Hey, friend.

27:21.553 --> 27:23.389
Need any help gettin' her out?

27:24.055 --> 27:26.099
She's not
really stuck, <i>amigo.</i>

27:26.183 --> 27:27.768
She's just a diversion.

27:27.851 --> 27:29.978
She's a virgin?

27:30.061 --> 27:32.148
I'm a virgin, too...

27:32.231 --> 27:34.191
unless you count canty-loupes.

27:34.941 --> 27:37.278
I believe that,
but she's a diversion

27:37.361 --> 27:38.945
to keep the banker busy

27:39.029 --> 27:41.698
so that my brother has time
to rob the bank.

27:41.782 --> 27:43.867
You're robbin' the bank?

27:43.950 --> 27:45.661
- Gall dang!
- Shh, shh.

27:45.744 --> 27:48.247
Gall dang.
Gall dang. Gall dang.

27:57.673 --> 27:59.049
Oh, no. Oh, no.

28:01.510 --> 28:03.887
No! Virgil! Virgil, the key!

28:06.723 --> 28:08.225
I'm Lil Pete.

28:08.309 --> 28:09.935
So, is your father, like, Big Pete?

28:10.018 --> 28:12.020
I didn't know my pa.

28:12.103 --> 28:15.441
But he was a bank robber like y'all!
His name was Frank.

28:16.233 --> 28:18.360
- Stockburn?
- How'd you know?

28:19.778 --> 28:21.112
Are you a wizard?

28:24.825 --> 28:26.452
<i>Hey, Johnny Law.</i>

28:26.535 --> 28:30.289
<i>We'll be waiting for you
up at Jawbone Falls.</i>

28:30.372 --> 28:31.873
<i>Frank Stockburn.</i>

28:32.541 --> 28:33.542
What?

28:33.625 --> 28:34.751
Robbery!

28:34.835 --> 28:37.087
We're being burgled!

28:37.879 --> 28:40.591
You! Horse-water-drinker!

28:40.674 --> 28:42.008
You are caught, sir!

28:52.853 --> 28:54.020
Oh!

28:54.104 --> 28:55.772
What are you?

28:56.440 --> 28:59.568
Hey, Tommy, guess what?
We got ourselves a little brother.

28:59.651 --> 29:02.779
Yeah! All our moms got porked
by the same outlaw.

29:02.863 --> 29:04.740
- Ain't that a pip?
- Yeah, that's something.

29:04.823 --> 29:07.618
Hey! Those <i>bandidos</i> just robbed the bank!

29:10.537 --> 29:12.914
Taste my bullets,
you dirty foreigners!

29:12.998 --> 29:14.458
Now!

29:18.920 --> 29:20.256
- Nice one, Burro.
- Wow!

29:20.339 --> 29:21.632
- There they are!
- We better make tracks.

29:21.715 --> 29:23.217
Can I come with?
I got a wagon.

29:23.300 --> 29:25.176
All right, that ain't a bad idea,
let's go.

29:25.261 --> 29:26.762
<i>Vámonos.</i> Come on!

29:27.804 --> 29:29.515
So, if you guys are
my brothers,

29:29.598 --> 29:31.350
you must got three nipples, too.

29:31.433 --> 29:32.643
I only got two.

29:32.726 --> 29:34.270
Yeah, just got the two.

29:34.353 --> 29:36.563
Oh, must be
from my mama's side.

29:36.647 --> 29:38.524
Forget I tolded you that, okay?

29:38.607 --> 29:39.691
Will do.

29:41.568 --> 29:42.986
Are you ready, Clem?

29:44.195 --> 29:46.573
Yep, yep. I'm... I'm ready.

29:52.746 --> 29:53.955
Spoon.

29:55.707 --> 29:57.000
Damn sharp.

30:02.464 --> 30:08.094
Look, fellas, I wanna hunt
this white Injun down same as you.

30:08.178 --> 30:09.930
But, uh... I...

30:11.181 --> 30:13.267
I have some problems with my eyes.

30:13.350 --> 30:17.354
You wanna join the Left-Eye Gang,
that right eye has gotta come out.

30:17.438 --> 30:19.440
It'll only hurt for a second.

30:19.523 --> 30:22.108
Yeah, like a hundred seconds.

30:22.192 --> 30:25.070
- Then you're one of us.
- For life.

30:26.029 --> 30:28.114
Okay, that makes sense.

30:30.116 --> 30:33.912
Is it okay if I scoop this left eye out?

30:33.995 --> 30:35.747
This is... I'm basically blind here.

30:35.831 --> 30:37.999
This right one sees like an eagle.

30:38.083 --> 30:41.002
Yeah, it just seems
like a waste that I'd...

30:41.086 --> 30:44.423
I understand your predicament,
but rules is rules.

30:44.506 --> 30:47.008
Yeah, guess it... makes sense.

30:52.473 --> 30:53.932
Oh, God!

30:54.015 --> 30:56.393
Hell, no!

30:56.477 --> 30:59.187
That ain't right!

31:00.105 --> 31:01.607
Damn!

31:01.690 --> 31:03.024
It's half way.

31:03.108 --> 31:04.901
- It's dangling by a vein!
- Whoo! Oh, man!

31:04.985 --> 31:07.278
It's crazy,
I can still see out of it!

31:07.363 --> 31:08.780
- Goddamn, it hurts!
- I think I'm gonna puke.

31:08.864 --> 31:12.158
It's just going round and round like
a tassel on a stripper's titty!

31:12.242 --> 31:13.827
Okay, gotta get it, gotta get it!

31:13.910 --> 31:15.454
I'm getting dizzy!

31:15.537 --> 31:17.205
Got it, got it, got it!

31:17.288 --> 31:18.289
Yeah!

31:18.374 --> 31:20.083
Ah!

31:20.166 --> 31:23.044
Oh, Lord! Holy shit.

31:24.129 --> 31:27.924
You done it, partner.
Welcome to the Left-Eye Gang.

31:28.008 --> 31:29.050
Whoo!

31:29.134 --> 31:30.386
I did it!

31:30.469 --> 31:33.555
I'm glad that's done.

31:33.639 --> 31:36.517
Let's just go get that
Injun-loving son of a bitch, huh?

31:36.600 --> 31:37.643
Yeah.

31:37.726 --> 31:39.811
- Yeah! Let's get him.
- Yeah.

31:39.895 --> 31:42.105
Like, so...

31:42.188 --> 31:44.274
Oh, I touched the hole.
I touched the hole!

31:46.777 --> 31:49.154
Got me a patch!

31:52.240 --> 31:55.035
<i>Dear Mama,
you may be wondering</i>

31:55.118 --> 31:59.289
<i>why I have not returned
from my trip to the ice cream store.</i>

31:59.373 --> 32:03.752
<i>It's because I met my brothers,
Ramon and Tommy.</i>

32:03.835 --> 32:06.004
<i>And we're trying to steal money.</i>

32:06.087 --> 32:09.633
<i>We need the money
to give to the bad men</i>

32:09.716 --> 32:14.555
<i>who took Pa away
to the land of the singing windmill.</i>

32:14.638 --> 32:19.518
<i>Tommy says it's not okay
to take money from decent folks.</i>

32:19.601 --> 32:20.602
I got the money!

32:20.686 --> 32:23.439
<i>Luckily, there's a lot of bad people
here in the West.</i>

32:23.522 --> 32:25.106
Yee-haw!

32:25.190 --> 32:26.400
Let's ride!

32:29.403 --> 32:31.905
Eat it! You know you like it.

32:31.988 --> 32:33.699
You know you like it.

32:34.324 --> 32:35.576
Good God!

32:35.659 --> 32:38.161
Good burro!

32:38.244 --> 32:39.496
That's right.

32:39.580 --> 32:40.581
Enjoy it!

32:41.582 --> 32:44.084
- That's just wrong.
- Yeah, yeah.

32:44.167 --> 32:45.168
Is it?

33:00.016 --> 33:03.353
This is so much better
than the cantaloupe.

33:07.566 --> 33:09.443
Good burro!

33:09.526 --> 33:12.278
<i>Slowly, but surely,</i>

33:12.362 --> 33:17.117
<i>we're chippin' away
at the $50,000 we need to save Pa.</i>

33:17.200 --> 33:19.620
<i>That's a lot of money,
isn't it, Mama?</i>

33:21.287 --> 33:22.330
<i>Mama?</i>

33:24.082 --> 33:28.462
<i>Oh, yeah, that's right.
I'm writing you a letter.</i>

33:29.588 --> 33:33.800
<i>Anyways, I can't wait
to actually meet my pa.</i>

33:33.884 --> 33:36.427
<i>I want him to teach me
how you make babies.</i>

33:36.512 --> 33:39.973
<i>And how the lady poops 'em out.</i>

33:40.056 --> 33:42.518
<i>Be home quick as I can.</i>

33:42.601 --> 33:45.812
<i>Your loving son, Lil Pete.</i>

34:10.128 --> 34:11.379
Tommy?

34:11.462 --> 34:13.255
Yeah, Lil Pete?

34:14.174 --> 34:16.092
Where's the singing windmill?

34:16.176 --> 34:18.719
It's where dad made
his biggest score.

34:20.138 --> 34:22.891
Maybe we'll get another clue
up at Jawbone Falls.

34:22.974 --> 34:26.393
That's where he used to hide out
when he was an outlaw.

34:26.476 --> 34:29.606
Oh, cool beans.

34:33.275 --> 34:34.527
Tommy?

34:34.610 --> 34:36.530
Yeah, Lil Pete?

34:37.487 --> 34:39.489
If we get caught stealing...

34:40.158 --> 34:41.868
would we be in trouble?

34:44.996 --> 34:46.456
I reckon we'll hang.

34:49.751 --> 34:52.378
Well... that's no bother.

34:53.463 --> 34:55.380
I got a real strong neck.

34:55.465 --> 34:59.427
Mama makes me pull the plow with my head
if I don't finish my schoolwork.

35:00.511 --> 35:02.180
Which occurs regularilly.

35:04.182 --> 35:06.810
Strong neck might come in handy.

35:06.893 --> 35:09.771
Okay, let's get our rest.

35:11.314 --> 35:13.233
Good night, Tommy.

35:14.400 --> 35:15.986
Good night, Lil Pete.

35:16.069 --> 35:18.488
Good night, Ramon.

35:18.572 --> 35:19.990
Good night, brothers.

35:20.991 --> 35:22.158
Good night, Burro.

35:26.412 --> 35:28.123
That's a dry one.

35:28.206 --> 35:30.166
We will have good dry weather tomorrow.

35:43.889 --> 35:45.431
Shoo, fly!

35:45.515 --> 35:46.642
Shoo!

35:49.144 --> 35:52.272
Oh, come on, fly, <i>vámonos!</i>
We need our sleep.

35:56.067 --> 35:58.278
Let me take care of this.

35:58.361 --> 36:00.113
How can you see a fly in the dark?

36:00.196 --> 36:03.449
A true hunter sees
with all his senses.

36:08.830 --> 36:10.957
That was some mystical shit, man.

36:14.419 --> 36:15.503
Uh-oh.

36:15.586 --> 36:17.964
I think you just nicked his biscuits off.

36:18.048 --> 36:20.216
That's what I was aiming for.

36:21.217 --> 36:22.969
He didn't deserve to die.

36:23.762 --> 36:26.556
He deserved to know
he was not welcome here.

36:26.640 --> 36:29.517
Raised by Indians, huh?

36:29.600 --> 36:31.687
That had some impact on you.

36:34.856 --> 36:36.733
Well, let me get this one.

36:44.908 --> 36:46.827
Sounded like a horse fly.

36:46.910 --> 36:49.705
That wasn't a horse fly,
that was my horse!

36:49.788 --> 36:51.247
Peanut?

36:51.331 --> 36:53.124
Oh, Peanut!

36:54.625 --> 36:57.420
Oh, the burro's gonna be pissed.

36:58.629 --> 37:00.173
You're doing <i>bueno,</i> Burro!

37:00.256 --> 37:03.134
Don't be intimidated by the horse,
you're just as good as him.

37:03.218 --> 37:05.136
I'm so hungry.

37:05.220 --> 37:07.347
There's breakfast all around.

37:07.430 --> 37:12.227
Nuts, berries, bark,
different kinds of mud.

37:12.310 --> 37:14.479
I wish there were taco trees.

37:14.562 --> 37:16.022
What's a taco?

37:16.106 --> 37:17.523
They're the best.

37:17.607 --> 37:21.236
Meat and cheese and tomatoes
in a crispy shell.

37:21.319 --> 37:22.738
You'd love it, man.

37:22.821 --> 37:25.240
Ooh, I want one.
I want 50.

37:25.323 --> 37:27.993
Hate to put an end
to this fascinating conversation,

37:28.076 --> 37:29.077
but we're here.

37:29.160 --> 37:31.747
Jawbone Falls.

37:33.915 --> 37:36.459
And there's a mansion next to it!

37:44.217 --> 37:45.676
Should we just go in?

37:46.762 --> 37:48.596
I reckon.

37:58.106 --> 37:59.149
Hello?

38:01.609 --> 38:02.652
<i>Hola.</i>

38:06.031 --> 38:09.284
Well, this is cozy.

38:16.041 --> 38:17.125
Hello?

38:26.634 --> 38:28.303
Hold on!

38:28.386 --> 38:30.138
Tommy!

38:37.979 --> 38:40.899
Stop! Leave my brother alone!

38:40.982 --> 38:43.068
No, no, no!

38:43.151 --> 38:45.361
Simon says, "Stop!"

38:45.445 --> 38:47.989
Don't hurt my brother!

38:49.115 --> 38:50.200
- Stop!
- Huh?

38:56.289 --> 38:57.623
Good thinking, Tommy.

38:57.707 --> 38:58.708
All right.

38:58.792 --> 39:01.002
Not for me, but good one, Tommy.

39:03.129 --> 39:05.756
Settle, settle, watch it...

39:05.841 --> 39:07.801
It's all right, it's all right...

39:09.760 --> 39:10.929
We don't mean no harm.

39:11.012 --> 39:14.140
- We're just looking for our dad.
<i>- Sí.</i>

39:14.224 --> 39:15.725
Is this your place?

39:17.227 --> 39:18.519
Whose place is it?

39:23.024 --> 39:24.192
Your mother?

39:24.275 --> 39:26.736
Oh, is she here right now?

39:29.780 --> 39:31.116
Oh, she's dead.

39:32.742 --> 39:34.953
I'm so sorry,
I'm sure she was a good woman.

39:36.412 --> 39:37.663
She died three years ago?

39:38.874 --> 39:39.916
Three months ago?

39:41.877 --> 39:44.545
Oh, your mama has three nipples?

39:44.629 --> 39:45.755
Huh?

39:48.633 --> 39:51.386
Yeah, there's three of us.

39:51.469 --> 39:53.721
- Three of us, <i>sí.</i>
- Okay. Okay.

39:53.804 --> 39:55.598
<i>Claro, tres. Sí. Sí.</i>

39:57.600 --> 39:58.601
Whoo-hoo!

39:58.684 --> 40:01.354
You and your mom were making
moonshine up here, huh?

40:01.437 --> 40:03.106
Much obliged.

40:03.814 --> 40:04.815
<i>Gracias.</i>

40:05.984 --> 40:09.362
Making moonshine for Frank Stockburn?

40:09.445 --> 40:10.989
You know Frank Stockburn?

40:13.992 --> 40:15.243
He slept here?

40:16.912 --> 40:18.079
With your mama?

40:24.335 --> 40:25.336
Okay.

40:31.384 --> 40:34.720
Your mama was an owl.

40:34.804 --> 40:38.058
No, our dad made his mom
make owl noises.

40:38.141 --> 40:39.434
Huh?

40:39.517 --> 40:43.771
Yeah, that's right, friend.
We're your brothers.

40:45.065 --> 40:46.857
Gall dang!

40:54.532 --> 40:55.533
Okay.

40:55.616 --> 40:57.911
- Down the hatch, boys!
<i>- Salud. Salud.</i>

41:00.330 --> 41:01.957
What's your name, anyways?

41:09.755 --> 41:14.260
H... R... M...

41:15.303 --> 41:18.181
Squiggly line, asterisk.

41:20.641 --> 41:22.185
How 'bout we just call you Herm?

41:23.853 --> 41:25.896
Herm, so you know,

41:25.981 --> 41:29.525
our dad was kidnapped
by some bad <i>muchachos.</i>

41:29.609 --> 41:31.027
Yeah,

41:31.111 --> 41:33.488
we need money to get him back.

41:33.571 --> 41:35.531
So we're going to steal the money.

41:37.993 --> 41:41.121
No, we're only stealing the money
from folks what are bad.

41:41.204 --> 41:42.622
Hmm...

41:43.999 --> 41:48.753
So do you know of any place where we could
steal a lot of money from some bad folks?

41:48.836 --> 41:50.463
Mmm...

41:52.173 --> 41:53.341
He's got something.

41:57.053 --> 41:59.764
The Gold Nugget Saloon, huh?

42:00.890 --> 42:02.225
I reckon you're coming with us?

42:06.812 --> 42:09.149
Smoking Fox
so worried about White Knife.

42:09.232 --> 42:11.192
We must get her to eat something.

42:11.276 --> 42:14.487
Oh, we having a little picnic here, huh?

42:14.570 --> 42:16.614
You have no right to be here!
This Apache land!

42:16.697 --> 42:19.284
And what you gonna do about it,
beaver breath?

42:19.367 --> 42:21.077
How he know my name?

42:21.161 --> 42:23.621
That's really her name!

42:26.541 --> 42:29.252
Yeah, I think you also could have
gone with "Face Like Witch."

42:29.335 --> 42:31.004
Or "Eats Like Pig."

42:31.087 --> 42:32.797
Or "Hit In Face With Diarrhea Stick."

42:34.590 --> 42:37.635
That's it? Nobody else?
Babyface? Stumbles?

42:37.718 --> 42:40.763
Hey, boss! Look what I got here!

42:40.846 --> 42:43.891
He ain't gonna be
happy about this.

42:43.974 --> 42:47.145
Well, well, well.

42:53.609 --> 42:56.487
Yep, used to be a prosperous town.

42:56.571 --> 43:01.201
Then the gold mine dried up
and the train stopped stopping.

43:01.284 --> 43:04.787
The saloon's the only place left that
still does a good business.

43:04.870 --> 43:09.167
Open day and night since they built it.
Ain't even a lock on the front door.

43:09.250 --> 43:10.501
It never closes.

43:12.378 --> 43:14.839
They got a big ol' golden nugget
hanging above the fireplace.

43:14.922 --> 43:16.924
Folks come from all over
just to take a look.

43:17.007 --> 43:20.010
They say it's worth about $20,000, easy.

43:21.471 --> 43:22.555
All right.

43:26.851 --> 43:30.646
I'm surprised no one's ever tried
to stolen that nugget.

43:30.730 --> 43:32.523
Oh, folks have tried.

43:32.607 --> 43:35.818
If you go in there, you see their thumbs
hanging above the bar.

43:35.901 --> 43:37.987
Smiley Harris, the owner,
bit them clean off.

43:38.071 --> 43:39.822
So nobody messes with Smiley.

43:44.494 --> 43:46.079
That sort of tickled.

43:46.162 --> 43:48.873
What we got going over here, friend?

43:48.956 --> 43:51.209
Just open your robe, please.

43:53.419 --> 43:54.920
Ooh...

43:55.004 --> 43:57.715
I have never seen that big of a rash...

43:57.798 --> 43:59.509
or infection

43:59.592 --> 44:02.803
or whatever this green bubble is.

44:02.887 --> 44:04.389
Hmm.

44:04.472 --> 44:05.556
All right.

44:08.101 --> 44:09.102
Yeah.

44:13.231 --> 44:16.567
Now, son, I would simply recommend
that you stop doing

44:16.651 --> 44:18.903
whatever it is you've been doing,

44:18.986 --> 44:21.156
with whoever...

44:21.239 --> 44:23.741
or whatever you've been doing it with.

44:32.292 --> 44:34.169
Yep, now they call him Smiley,

44:34.252 --> 44:38.298
'cause even when committing
the most unspeakable atrocities,

44:38.381 --> 44:41.426
a cheerful grin never leaves his face.

44:43.386 --> 44:45.638
All right, just lift your tail
for me, please.

44:47.182 --> 44:49.309
Now, he's why that nugget
has never been stolen.

44:50.435 --> 44:52.353
And never will be stolen.

44:57.358 --> 44:59.235
This'll prevent infection.

45:03.781 --> 45:05.533
It tastes good, too.

45:05.616 --> 45:10.871
This Smiley fella, sounds more like
a hooligan than a barkeep.

45:10.955 --> 45:12.207
You're not far off.

45:12.290 --> 45:13.958
Rumor has it that back in the old days

45:14.041 --> 45:16.085
he used to run
with the Frank Stockburn Gang.

45:17.753 --> 45:19.129
Lip balm?

45:19.214 --> 45:21.341
I reckon I'm good.

45:36.439 --> 45:37.773
Come on, champ!

46:04.592 --> 46:07.637
That Smiley fellow,
he don't joke around.

46:07.720 --> 46:09.264
Oh... I joke around...

46:09.972 --> 46:11.682
but never when it comes to my business.

46:11.766 --> 46:14.143
Welcome to the Gold Nugget, gentlemen.

46:14.226 --> 46:17.480
Mr. Harris,
it's quite a nice spread you got here.

46:17.563 --> 46:19.524
So what brings you gentlemen to town?

46:19.607 --> 46:24.069
Actually, we wanted to ask you
about something, Mr. Harris.

46:24.153 --> 46:25.571
Excuse me.

46:26.406 --> 46:30.200
I am conversing with these gentlemen, sir.
I shall be with you in a moment.

46:30.285 --> 46:33.288
I need to talk to you about
Frank Stockburn.

46:37.750 --> 46:40.127
I haven't heard that name in many a year.

46:40.210 --> 46:41.296
You know him.

46:41.379 --> 46:44.214
Mr. Stockburn and I
were business partners.

46:44.299 --> 46:46.426
I got a photograph.

46:46.509 --> 46:50.721
You see, that there's him...
and that's you.

46:50.805 --> 46:52.515
You rode in his gang.

46:52.598 --> 46:56.268
To be precise...
it was our gang.

46:56.352 --> 46:59.021
He went on to a criminal career
of some renown,

46:59.104 --> 47:02.525
while I achieved great success
in the legitimate business world.

47:02.608 --> 47:03.984
Please help me.

47:04.068 --> 47:06.028
Sir, you are becoming a nuisance.

47:06.111 --> 47:08.573
I just need to tell him what I've done.

47:35.099 --> 47:37.893
I think he's had enough, boss.

47:40.438 --> 47:42.440
Yes.

47:42.523 --> 47:45.192
My apologies, gentlemen.

47:45.275 --> 47:47.403
Not my favorite subject.

47:47.487 --> 47:49.614
A round on the house.

47:51.031 --> 47:54.494
And, Chico, if you ever
grab my arm like that again,

47:54.577 --> 47:56.412
I'll put six bullets in your head.

47:58.831 --> 48:00.082
That's quite a beating.

48:00.165 --> 48:02.710
Hope you and your drink are okay.

48:03.628 --> 48:06.547
Why do you want to meet
this Frank Stockburn so badly, huh?

48:06.631 --> 48:08.716
Frank Stockburn's my father.

48:10.843 --> 48:14.430
If Frank Stockburn is your father,
raise your hand.

48:16.891 --> 48:18.476
Gall dang!

48:27.985 --> 48:31.489
Chico's right.
Getting late, starting to thin out.

48:33.616 --> 48:35.325
Can I tell you guys something?

48:35.410 --> 48:37.787
Because I don't wanna have
no secrets between us.

48:37.870 --> 48:38.996
Of course.

48:39.079 --> 48:41.040
- Yeah, we're brothers.
- Yeah.

48:41.123 --> 48:45.420
Now, I know Dad is a white man,
but my mother...

48:45.503 --> 48:47.212
was actually black.

48:47.296 --> 48:51.008
So that, technically,
makes me half-black.

48:51.091 --> 48:52.885
Is that right?

48:52.968 --> 48:54.528
Well, I didn't wanna hide that from you

48:54.595 --> 48:57.389
in case you guys slipped up
and made some racial slurs

48:57.473 --> 49:00.768
- not knowing I wasn't 100% white.
- Hmm.

49:00.851 --> 49:03.228
I mean, I knew she must've
been really muscular,

49:03.312 --> 49:05.606
but I had no idea she was black.

49:05.690 --> 49:06.732
Yeah, I mean, I guess,

49:06.816 --> 49:08.776
now that you mention it,
I see it a little bit.

49:10.110 --> 49:12.655
My mother's Swedish.

49:12.738 --> 49:15.575
I don't think so.
I reckon she's Mexican.

49:17.076 --> 49:19.036
Lying bitch!

49:20.120 --> 49:22.873
So do you new brothers
have any special skills

49:22.957 --> 49:25.000
that could help us out here tonight?

49:25.084 --> 49:26.085
Like what?

49:26.168 --> 49:28.546
Like, you know,
Tommy's good with knives.

49:28.629 --> 49:31.006
Lil Pete's got a bonus nipple.

49:31.090 --> 49:32.675
I got a burro.

49:34.426 --> 49:36.596
Herm is good at strangling.

49:36.679 --> 49:40.349
- Huh?
- I can hold my breath for six minutes.

49:40.432 --> 49:43.102
Well, I can play the piano with my dick.

49:43.185 --> 49:46.313
Well, we're unstoppable then.

49:46.396 --> 49:50.943
Anyways, any of you handsome brothers
ready to go steal a big hunk of gold?

49:51.026 --> 49:52.987
- I'm ready.
- I'm hungry.

49:53.070 --> 49:54.572
- I'm drunk.
- And I'm Lil Pete.

49:55.906 --> 49:57.992
Let's get that nugget then.

50:39.449 --> 50:41.035
Oh...

50:41.118 --> 50:44.622
You've got some pair of <i>huevos</i>
coming into my place, son.

50:44.705 --> 50:47.499
I sure am sorry
about what happened, Mr. Harris.

50:47.583 --> 50:50.085
In fact, I'd like to buy you a drink...

50:50.169 --> 50:52.838
of the good stuff,
if that's okay?

50:53.548 --> 50:57.635
Barkeep, you got any scotch,
real scotch, from scotch-land?

51:00.763 --> 51:04.308
We keep the imported stuff in the back.
I'll go and fetch it for you.

51:04.391 --> 51:05.726
That's wonderful.

51:22.117 --> 51:23.786
Now, I didn't hear that,
did you?

51:23.869 --> 51:25.245
I did.

51:48.185 --> 51:49.854
I don't know,
maybe I'm turned round.

51:49.937 --> 51:52.857
I thought that, like,
tonight was gonna be Fajita Friday

51:52.940 --> 51:54.900
or line dancing or something.

51:54.984 --> 51:58.362
It just seems quiet, but y'all be good.
Stay warm.

51:58.445 --> 52:00.990
- Hey, he's got the thumbs!
- They came with the pants!

52:05.577 --> 52:07.663
Right on the rocks,
right on the rocks.

52:07.747 --> 52:10.290
Oh, you're gaining on me!
You're gaining on me!

52:10.374 --> 52:13.168
You don't even understand
what we're gonna do to...

52:17.632 --> 52:19.925
Teach them not to mess
with the Stockburn brothers!

52:30.645 --> 52:33.898
<i>Smiley...</i>

52:43.448 --> 52:46.201
<i>I'm watching you!</i>

52:46.285 --> 52:47.787
Who's that?

52:51.373 --> 52:52.833
Ladies.

52:56.295 --> 53:00.549
<i>What's behind door number three?</i>

53:06.555 --> 53:10.600
Okay, ladies, take your clothes off
and start punching me in the face.

53:10.685 --> 53:11.727
Sorry, carry on.

53:11.811 --> 53:13.688
Hallelujah!

53:16.190 --> 53:21.236
<i>Smiley,
why don't you visit your grandma...</i>

53:21.320 --> 53:22.988
<i>In hell!</i>

53:43.175 --> 53:45.052
<i>Smiley.</i>

53:45.135 --> 53:49.431
<i>You cannot
escape me, Smiley!</i>

53:54.519 --> 53:57.689
Give me my thumbs back.

54:04.571 --> 54:06.698
It's too big, Lil Pete!

54:06.782 --> 54:07.950
What's too big?

54:08.784 --> 54:11.078
Uh... plan B's too big?

54:11.161 --> 54:12.662
What the hell is plan B?

54:12.747 --> 54:14.373
Let me show you.

54:15.124 --> 54:16.208
Plan B!

54:37.729 --> 54:40.524
Yeah, works better if you have knives.

54:40.607 --> 54:43.527
Yeah, that makes sense.

54:43.610 --> 54:44.862
Come on.

54:46.989 --> 54:48.573
You can take 'em!
Come on!

54:48.657 --> 54:51.118
I got the nugget! I got the nugget!
What do we do?

54:51.201 --> 54:52.870
- He's shooting like a madman!
- Come on!

54:52.953 --> 54:54.997
- Big bullets! Big bullets!
- Come on! Come on!

54:58.959 --> 55:01.253
Next man who moves will die!

55:05.257 --> 55:07.259
Who are you people?

55:14.308 --> 55:16.601
We are the Stockburn brothers.

55:16.685 --> 55:18.562
Frank's kids?

55:22.149 --> 55:26.904
Well... this is interesting.

55:26.987 --> 55:30.407
You know, the last time
I saw your father was in Utah.

55:30.490 --> 55:32.784
Just rang up our biggest score.

55:33.953 --> 55:35.620
But when we was dividing it up,

55:35.704 --> 55:38.623
we started having trouble
with the arithmetic.

55:38.707 --> 55:42.878
And somehow I ended up
abandoned beside a windmill,

55:42.962 --> 55:47.591
knife stuck in my guts,
left to die like a dog.

55:47.674 --> 55:50.010
Frank had taken it all.

55:50.094 --> 55:53.180
But now, I get to take something.

55:53.263 --> 55:57.476
The lives of his five ridiculous sons.

56:01.271 --> 56:02.689
Don't forget about <i>número seis!</i>

56:07.194 --> 56:09.279
Holy moly!

56:09.363 --> 56:10.906
No! Hell, no!

56:27.172 --> 56:30.800
He's giving himself
six bullets to the head!

56:30.885 --> 56:33.053
And he's still smiling!

56:44.356 --> 56:46.316
I was just trying to knock him out.

56:47.359 --> 56:49.987
Well, you succeeded.

56:50.070 --> 56:51.906
I don't think he's waking up
from that one.

56:51.989 --> 56:53.865
You done a number on him, Ramon.

56:53.949 --> 56:55.409
You did!
You did a number there.

56:55.492 --> 56:57.744
- Yeah, you did!
- Hey! Hey!

57:11.841 --> 57:14.803
Plan B was officially insane!

57:18.765 --> 57:22.102
Here you are, Danny.
It's an old Apache remedy.

57:24.063 --> 57:27.191
Clears your head after too much firewater.

57:27.274 --> 57:31.111
You know everything, Tommy.
Where'd you learn all this stuff?

57:31.195 --> 57:33.113
My father taught me.

57:33.197 --> 57:36.450
Dad? I thought you just met him last week.

57:36.533 --> 57:39.744
Not our father. Screaming Eagle.

57:39.828 --> 57:41.663
He raised me since I was a kid.

57:41.746 --> 57:45.834
He's the kindest...
wisest man I've ever known.

57:45.918 --> 57:47.002
Wow...

57:48.087 --> 57:50.130
must've been nice to have a dad.

57:50.214 --> 57:53.508
Oh, yeah, someone to wrastle with

57:53.592 --> 57:55.844
and teach you how
to cut up your panny-cakes.

57:55.928 --> 58:00.515
Someone to give you advice
when you screwed up real, real bad.

58:01.766 --> 58:03.310
Well, we do got a dad.

58:04.728 --> 58:06.855
And we're gonna see him real soon.

58:09.274 --> 58:11.568
Yeah... I can't wait.

58:13.153 --> 58:14.446
Yeah.

59:37.112 --> 59:38.363
Hit it, Herm!

01:01:03.198 --> 01:01:04.324
What the...

01:01:06.535 --> 01:01:07.994
Okay, boys.

01:01:09.078 --> 01:01:10.747
I'm gonna check this out.

01:01:13.792 --> 01:01:17.086
The ball is in your hand,
twist the leg, then you let it go!

01:01:17.171 --> 01:01:18.922
Now, let me see.
Ready, men?

01:01:20.132 --> 01:01:22.426
No, no, no!

01:01:22.509 --> 01:01:25.137
You're not listening to me, Hung Shin!

01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:27.972
You have to be very precise.

01:01:28.056 --> 01:01:30.517
Precise...

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.018
I say!

01:01:32.101 --> 01:01:33.270
You there!

01:01:33.353 --> 01:01:36.440
I have a proposition.

01:01:36.523 --> 01:01:39.901
How would you men like to participate

01:01:39.984 --> 01:01:43.071
in the birth of something extraordinary?

01:01:43.155 --> 01:01:47.242
Well, we ain't got time for that,
but you can have your brown thing back.

01:01:48.618 --> 01:01:50.704
What's so damnably important

01:01:50.787 --> 01:01:53.165
that you need to miss
your rendezvous with history?

01:01:53.248 --> 01:01:56.125
We gotta save our daddy,
Frank Stockburn.

01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:57.669
Frank Stockburn, the outlaw?

01:01:57.752 --> 01:02:00.088
- You know our dad?
- Without a doubt.

01:02:00.172 --> 01:02:02.757
One of the best poker players
I've ever played against.

01:02:02.841 --> 01:02:07.846
I played him in Ezekiel Grant's
annual Valentine's Day game down in Yuma.

01:02:07.929 --> 01:02:12.809
Thousands of dollars on the table,
but Stockburn doesn't bat an eyelash.

01:02:12.892 --> 01:02:16.730
He happen to mention anything
about what his biggest score was?

01:02:16.813 --> 01:02:20.149
Over in Utah?
A guy named Smiley Harris?

01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:22.652
I'll make you a deal.

01:02:22.736 --> 01:02:26.740
Help me out a bit
and I'll tell you all I know.

01:02:26.823 --> 01:02:29.493
Deal. Tommy Dunson.

01:02:29.576 --> 01:02:33.205
Abner Doubleday.
Let's play ball.

01:02:39.419 --> 01:02:44.383
Welcome, my friends, to the first ever
playing of a new sport.

01:02:44.466 --> 01:02:48.345
A sport of my own devising.

01:02:48.428 --> 01:02:54.643
On this field, two ten-person teams
will engage in a battle of...

01:02:54.726 --> 01:02:56.185
Yes, Qi?

01:02:56.270 --> 01:02:59.022
Only 18 people here.

01:03:00.148 --> 01:03:06.530
Two nine-person teams will engage in
a battle of strength, speed, and strategy.

01:03:06.613 --> 01:03:11.326
One team will go out onto
the field to play defense

01:03:11.410 --> 01:03:16.039
while the other team
will take turns hitting this ball...

01:03:17.541 --> 01:03:18.958
with a stickie.

01:03:19.042 --> 01:03:21.127
What are you gonna call this game?

01:03:21.210 --> 01:03:22.462
What else?

01:03:22.546 --> 01:03:25.214
Stickie McSchnickens.

01:03:27.467 --> 01:03:32.389
Now your goal, ball thrower,
is to get the ball past me two times

01:03:32.472 --> 01:03:34.057
without my hitting it.

01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:37.226
Fire when ready.

01:03:40.605 --> 01:03:44.150
I didn't know you were going
to toss it quite so hard, ball thrower.

01:03:44.233 --> 01:03:45.234
All right.

01:03:50.782 --> 01:03:53.993
Okay, that's two past ya.
So you're done, right?

01:03:54.077 --> 01:03:56.162
No, no, I said three times.

01:03:56.245 --> 01:03:57.997
No, you said two.

01:03:58.081 --> 01:04:00.875
I said three!
Three strikes and I'm out.

01:04:00.959 --> 01:04:03.795
I know what I said, shortstop.

01:04:05.171 --> 01:04:08.049
That's your new name.
Short Stop, that's right.

01:04:08.132 --> 01:04:09.884
Now and forever.
Forever and ever!

01:04:09.968 --> 01:04:11.970
Short Stop.
Short Stop, Short Stop.

01:04:12.053 --> 01:04:13.096
Short Stop.

01:04:15.181 --> 01:04:16.558
Yes, all right.

01:04:18.310 --> 01:04:19.978
Strike three!
You're out!

01:04:20.061 --> 01:04:24.190
No, no, the ball was... too low.

01:04:24.273 --> 01:04:29.321
In order for it to count as a strike,
it has to pass through the...

01:04:29.404 --> 01:04:30.655
strike zone.

01:04:30.739 --> 01:04:32.407
- Strike zone?
- That's right.

01:04:32.491 --> 01:04:36.911
And if you don't get the ball past me,
between my knees and my titties,

01:04:36.995 --> 01:04:38.162
it's not a strike.

01:04:38.246 --> 01:04:39.748
It's a non-strike.

01:04:39.831 --> 01:04:41.458
And if you throw me four non-strikes,

01:04:41.541 --> 01:04:44.586
I get an express ticket to first base
without my even hitting it.

01:04:45.086 --> 01:04:46.380
Oh.

01:04:46.463 --> 01:04:47.881
All right, are we ready?

01:04:52.511 --> 01:04:55.639
That also gets me to first base...
as well.

01:05:06.941 --> 01:05:08.192
Where you going?
Nobody hit it.

01:05:08.276 --> 01:05:11.488
I stole the base.
You weren't looking, so I stole it.

01:05:11.571 --> 01:05:14.699
You said you could only advance
after you hit the ball!

01:05:14.783 --> 01:05:16.993
Not when you're stealing.

01:05:17.076 --> 01:05:18.703
That's bullshit.

01:05:18.787 --> 01:05:20.038
Okay, Short Stop.

01:05:37.889 --> 01:05:38.973
He's moving!

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:42.644
Safe!

01:05:49.693 --> 01:05:50.694
Gall dang, I don't know.

01:05:50.777 --> 01:05:53.780
- That was a tie.
- Yes, and tie goes to the runner!

01:05:53.863 --> 01:05:55.449
Why's that?

01:05:55.532 --> 01:05:59.869
Because those are the rules
of Stickie McSchnickens, that's why.

01:06:02.956 --> 01:06:04.624
All right, it's all mine,
I've got it!

01:06:04.708 --> 01:06:07.919
No! No, you can't run.
You cannot run.

01:06:08.002 --> 01:06:11.923
Infield fly rule... in full effect.

01:06:14.676 --> 01:06:15.719
You're out.

01:06:17.596 --> 01:06:19.196
- Here we go, Herm.
- Okay, Herm!

01:06:19.263 --> 01:06:20.306
Yeah.

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:26.605
Oh!

01:06:26.688 --> 01:06:28.482
Oh, I'm not getting that.

01:06:28.565 --> 01:06:29.691
Yeah, <i>bueno!</i>

01:06:29.774 --> 01:06:33.778
You can just run all the way home.
A home runner.

01:06:35.196 --> 01:06:36.906
I need a cold drink.

01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:40.702
Let's take a five-minute stretch
and then start the second half.

01:06:40.785 --> 01:06:42.496
Mr. Doubleday, we're done.

01:06:42.579 --> 01:06:44.623
But we've only played nine innings.

01:06:44.706 --> 01:06:48.460
Nine innings is enough.
Tell us about Dad's biggest score.

01:06:48.543 --> 01:06:50.128
Fine.

01:06:50.211 --> 01:06:56.593
Your father and his gang knocked off
an entire cavalry regiment, 120 men,

01:06:56.676 --> 01:06:59.137
five trunks filled with Yankee money.

01:07:00.472 --> 01:07:01.598
Where'd that happen?

01:07:01.681 --> 01:07:04.601
Up at Sweet Hog Rock...

01:07:04.684 --> 01:07:06.561
100 miles due north.

01:07:06.645 --> 01:07:08.396
You'll know it when you see it.

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:10.231
Well, fellas,

01:07:10.314 --> 01:07:14.318
looks like we're going to Sweet Hog Rock
to find ourselves a singing windmill.

01:07:14.402 --> 01:07:16.112
But we still need another 10,000 bucks.

01:07:16.195 --> 01:07:18.532
I reckon we'll make a quick stop, then.

01:07:18.615 --> 01:07:20.366
Before you go...

01:07:20.449 --> 01:07:23.411
do you wanna line up and shake hands
and say "good game" to each other?

01:07:24.037 --> 01:07:25.038
No.

01:07:26.498 --> 01:07:28.542
Them boys were nice fellers.

01:07:28.625 --> 01:07:31.920
Paid in cash.
Kept the profanity to a minimum.

01:07:32.003 --> 01:07:35.924
And the Mexican brother knocked
this hard-ass' head off with a shovel?

01:07:36.007 --> 01:07:39.761
Dang thing flew nearly 40 feet!
And still a-smilin'.

01:07:39.844 --> 01:07:40.845
Oh! Man!

01:07:40.929 --> 01:07:43.347
And hasn't stopped yet.

01:07:47.185 --> 01:07:52.106
Oh, hell, no!
My man gluing on heads and shit!

01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:54.693
Wish he'd glue the head back on my pecker.

01:07:54.776 --> 01:07:56.235
What happened to your pecker?

01:07:56.319 --> 01:07:59.573
I was part of another gang
before I joined up with y'all.

01:07:59.656 --> 01:08:00.740
Texas Stubbies.

01:08:00.824 --> 01:08:04.077
Okay,
never mind all that. Okay?

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:08.790
Now, Doc, you know which way
them there Ridiculous 6 rode off to?

01:08:08.873 --> 01:08:11.459
We're traveling
with a friend of theirs who, uh...

01:08:11.543 --> 01:08:13.628
will be real excited to see them.

01:08:13.712 --> 01:08:16.089
Well, they headed up north
to the Turquoise Trail.

01:08:17.215 --> 01:08:18.800
I can show you on the map over here.

01:08:20.885 --> 01:08:23.638
Looking forward to seeing
your man beg for his life?

01:08:24.848 --> 01:08:27.058
'Cause that's what's gonna happen,
Smoking Fox.

01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:29.685
Chicken pox!

01:08:29.769 --> 01:08:32.689
We're gaining on his
Injun-loving ass every day.

01:08:32.772 --> 01:08:34.314
He messed with the Left-Eye Gang!

01:08:34.398 --> 01:08:35.567
He's gonna be like,

01:08:35.649 --> 01:08:42.240
"Wait, how did you find me, and where...
How did you get my girl?"

01:08:42.323 --> 01:08:46.452
And then old Dumb Knife's gonna realize
that he's in way over his head.

01:08:49.497 --> 01:08:53.417
See, when George Washington
invented America...

01:09:11.102 --> 01:09:12.770
Excuse me, Sheriff.

01:09:12.854 --> 01:09:14.648
Is there a church in this town?

01:09:14.731 --> 01:09:17.901
This is Rattler's Gulch, you halfwit.

01:09:17.984 --> 01:09:21.738
The meanest, crookedest,
most hellacious town in the West.

01:09:21.821 --> 01:09:25.408
We don't need no preacher telling us
what we can and cannot do.

01:09:25.491 --> 01:09:28.243
So it's all right
if I do this to your wife?

01:09:49.307 --> 01:09:53.060
I can't wait to see all you nice people
when I'm dangling!

01:09:53.144 --> 01:09:54.603
You sick bastard.

01:09:54.688 --> 01:09:56.230
Get this over with.

01:09:56.314 --> 01:10:00.109
You're in for a real treat today.
This is gonna be so much fun.

01:10:08.952 --> 01:10:11.204
I'm just messing with y'all.
I'm fine!

01:10:13.247 --> 01:10:15.124
I call this one Fish Out of Water.

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.185
Yeah!

01:10:41.109 --> 01:10:42.151
Yeah!

01:10:42.777 --> 01:10:45.446
Herm, put the hookers back.

01:10:47.198 --> 01:10:48.574
Come on!

01:10:52.078 --> 01:10:55.874
Yeah, you can't catch me!

01:10:58.835 --> 01:11:01.838
He ain't dying, Billy!
He's making a fool of you!

01:11:01.921 --> 01:11:03.464
Whoo-hoo!

01:11:03.547 --> 01:11:04.548
All right, that's it!

01:11:04.632 --> 01:11:06.425
We'll shoot the son of a bitch!

01:11:06.509 --> 01:11:08.136
On my command!

01:11:08.219 --> 01:11:10.304
Ready...

01:11:10.388 --> 01:11:11.680
Aim...

01:11:12.265 --> 01:11:14.058
Fire!

01:11:20.523 --> 01:11:23.777
Wind took him, Tommy.
Came damn close.

01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:26.070
I'm okay!

01:11:26.154 --> 01:11:28.364
Come on, Billy!
Get him!

01:11:28.447 --> 01:11:29.991
We did it!

01:11:32.869 --> 01:11:36.122
I told ya
I got a strong neck!

01:11:49.552 --> 01:11:52.430
We still gotta get to Sweet Hog Rock
before they do.

01:11:52.513 --> 01:11:55.016
Gotta find that singing windmill,
so it ain't over yet.

01:11:55.099 --> 01:11:56.309
We got the money!

01:11:56.392 --> 01:11:59.478
- The Ridiculous 6 got all the money!
- Yeah!

01:11:59.562 --> 01:12:00.646
Yeah!

01:12:02.941 --> 01:12:05.985
Tommy! Tommy! What's Dad like?
Is he funny?

01:12:06.069 --> 01:12:07.653
Yeah, is he a good listener?

01:12:07.736 --> 01:12:09.155
Is he strong?

01:12:13.659 --> 01:12:17.038
All great questions.
I'll tell you this.

01:12:17.121 --> 01:12:19.040
I think you guys are gonna love him.

01:12:20.083 --> 01:12:23.127
But I'm sure he's gonna love you guys.

01:12:25.421 --> 01:12:28.174
So sorry to interrupt
such a tender moment.

01:12:28.257 --> 01:12:31.344
Looks like we stumbled
on bath day, boys!

01:12:33.096 --> 01:12:35.723
I heard you picked up some brothers
along the way, tough guy.

01:12:35.807 --> 01:12:37.809
But I don't see no resemblance.

01:12:37.892 --> 01:12:41.479
I do, they all look like my butthole.

01:12:44.732 --> 01:12:46.650
So guess what time it is, boys?

01:12:46.734 --> 01:12:48.027
Payback time!

01:12:48.111 --> 01:12:51.489
Any last words,
No Knife?

01:12:58.496 --> 01:12:59.956
I told ya I could hold my breath good.

01:13:00.039 --> 01:13:01.249
Yeah, Danny boy!

01:13:01.332 --> 01:13:04.043
What are you doing, man?
We gotta go!

01:13:06.670 --> 01:13:09.090
- Oh, jackpot, boys!
- No!

01:13:10.299 --> 01:13:12.093
- That's ours!
- Hyah!

01:13:16.264 --> 01:13:17.390
Rusty!

01:13:17.473 --> 01:13:19.808
Rusty, no, come back!

01:13:19.893 --> 01:13:20.935
No.

01:13:32.821 --> 01:13:36.868
How are we gonna save him?
We're startin' all over.

01:13:36.951 --> 01:13:39.287
Is there any more good places
we can rob?

01:13:39.370 --> 01:13:43.082
You know like a burro-grooming place
or a shoe store for burros?

01:13:43.749 --> 01:13:46.502
Half the lawmen in the West
are already looking for us.

01:13:46.585 --> 01:13:49.255
So what?
Look, we can't stop.

01:13:49.338 --> 01:13:50.589
They're going to kill him!

01:13:50.673 --> 01:13:53.051
Ain't no difference.
He's dying anyways.

01:13:57.096 --> 01:13:58.764
Dad's sick.

01:13:59.933 --> 01:14:01.559
I'm sorry I didn't tell y'all.

01:14:02.435 --> 01:14:04.896
There's a good chance
he's dead already.

01:14:07.731 --> 01:14:11.610
But there's a chance he's not.
You got to meet him, Tommy.

01:14:11.694 --> 01:14:13.612
The rest of us...

01:14:13.696 --> 01:14:16.199
Even if it was just for five minutes,
it'd be worth it.

01:14:16.282 --> 01:14:22.080
If I don't talk to Dad, I'll die with this
dirty secret burnin' a hole in my guts.

01:14:22.163 --> 01:14:26.834
Danito, whatever it is you did,
you have to forgive yourself, man.

01:14:26.918 --> 01:14:29.253
You wouldn't say that if you know
what I done.

01:14:29.337 --> 01:14:31.797
- Everybody's got secrets, Danny.
- Yeah.

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:34.258
You guys are the first people
I told I was black.

01:14:34.342 --> 01:14:36.802
You know how good that made me feel?

01:14:36.885 --> 01:14:38.972
We're your brothers.

01:14:39.055 --> 01:14:41.057
You can tell us anything.

01:14:42.808 --> 01:14:43.935
I, uh...

01:14:47.271 --> 01:14:50.024
I used to work
for the President of the United States.

01:14:51.817 --> 01:14:53.819
I was his personal bodyguard.

01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:56.072
One of the best.

01:14:56.990 --> 01:14:58.866
Till one night...

01:15:03.912 --> 01:15:07.166
Mr. President, say, I'm gonna go
hit the little boys' room.

01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:09.502
Are you shitting me?

01:15:09.585 --> 01:15:11.837
Come on!
You'll be fine, superstar.

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:15.174
Can I get ya something on the way back?
<i>Agua?</i> Brewski?

01:15:15.258 --> 01:15:16.384
No!

01:15:16.467 --> 01:15:19.678
Mrs. Lincoln, how about one of them
big pretzels or a little pillow?

01:15:19.762 --> 01:15:21.680
I hear this play's kind of a long one.

01:15:22.806 --> 01:15:25.309
All right, fair enough.
I'll be back in two.

01:15:32.441 --> 01:15:34.277
Where's the president's box?

01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:36.988
- John Wilkes Booth, the actor?
- Yeah.

01:15:37.071 --> 01:15:39.823
No way, man! Big fan!

01:15:39.907 --> 01:15:41.742
- You wanna say hi to the president?
- Yeah.

01:15:41.825 --> 01:15:44.453
He'd get a real kick out of that.
Last door on the left.

01:15:44.537 --> 01:15:46.539
- Thank you.
- Really cool.

01:15:46.622 --> 01:15:49.042
Wow! Love that guy!

01:15:54.547 --> 01:15:58.551
Abe!

01:16:02.930 --> 01:16:07.435
How can you go on living your life
knowing you harmed so many people?

01:16:07.518 --> 01:16:09.353
That's what I wanna ask Dad.

01:16:09.437 --> 01:16:12.815
Hey, you ain't the one
who pulled that trigger.

01:16:12.898 --> 01:16:15.859
But if Dad's gotta be
the one who tells you that...

01:16:18.029 --> 01:16:19.780
then let's go get that money.

01:16:19.863 --> 01:16:22.366
I just wish I knew how.

01:16:25.994 --> 01:16:27.246
Herm's got an idea.

01:16:28.622 --> 01:16:30.041
He just can't express it.

01:16:31.667 --> 01:16:33.752
I just wish somebody here
could speak Herm.

01:16:40.426 --> 01:16:42.720
<i>Tomorrow is Valentine's Day.</i>

01:16:42.803 --> 01:16:47.350
<i>That's when Ezekiel Grant has his annual
high-stakes poker game.</i>

01:16:47.433 --> 01:16:51.187
<i>There'll be oodles of money there.
Oodles, I say.</i>

01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:52.730
Ooh.

01:16:52.813 --> 01:16:55.816
- I don't know. That sounds risky.
- What's risky?

01:16:55.899 --> 01:17:00.113
He's suggesting we...
knock off Ezekiel Grant's poker game.

01:17:00.196 --> 01:17:01.447
It's in Yuma tomorrow night.

01:17:01.530 --> 01:17:03.782
Yuma's less than a day's walk from here.

01:17:03.866 --> 01:17:07.620
That poker game, there's practically
gonna be an army protectin' it.

01:17:07.703 --> 01:17:11.874
If Tommy says we can beat 'em,
I'll believe him.

01:17:11.957 --> 01:17:14.918
We all will.

01:17:17.171 --> 01:17:18.506
We can beat 'em...

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:20.924
for Dad.

01:17:21.008 --> 01:17:22.635
For Dad!

01:17:37.650 --> 01:17:41.612
I hope you like the gift I'm giving you
for Valentine's Day, Ezekiel.

01:17:41.695 --> 01:17:46.033
I'll give you a hint.
One-hour massage, no charge.

01:17:46.117 --> 01:17:48.411
Oh, Susannah.

01:17:48.494 --> 01:17:50.371
You know what gift I'd really love?

01:17:50.454 --> 01:17:53.124
If you would just shut up!

01:17:53.749 --> 01:17:56.544
Nothing ruins a good poker game more...

01:17:56.627 --> 01:18:00.423
than a lady jabbering on and on...

01:18:00.506 --> 01:18:02.716
How romantic.

01:18:05.636 --> 01:18:06.637
- Hello!
- Hello!

01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:09.097
Well, General Custer!

01:18:09.182 --> 01:18:10.516
Yes, at your service.

01:18:10.599 --> 01:18:12.143
Mr. Mark Twain.

01:18:12.226 --> 01:18:14.270
- Word up!
- Gentlemen, do come in.

01:18:14.353 --> 01:18:18.941
Yo, Zeke, big boy, I was just going off
to the General here about my new book.

01:18:19.024 --> 01:18:21.235
- It's a sequel to <i>Tom Sawyer.</i>
- Ooh.

01:18:21.319 --> 01:18:24.197
It's about Sawyer's home slice,
Huckleberry Finn.

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:28.116
White boy goes raftin' with a brother.
People gonna lose their shit!

01:18:29.285 --> 01:18:33.539
And, General Custer, I see you've let
your dashing blond hair grow out.

01:18:33.622 --> 01:18:36.792
Well, yes, the barber down at
the regiment is just awful,

01:18:36.875 --> 01:18:40.546
so I had two choices,
either let it grow or get scalped.

01:18:40.629 --> 01:18:43.341
And I ain't gonna let that happen.

01:18:43.424 --> 01:18:46.302
Now, will our old friend
from Tombstone be joining us?

01:18:46.385 --> 01:18:47.428
Late as usual.

01:18:47.511 --> 01:18:52.891
But we have a new player,
a wealthy Mexican coffee bean rancher.

01:18:52.975 --> 01:18:54.059
Am I tardy-o?

01:18:54.142 --> 01:18:57.104
Oh. Sneaky little Mexican.

01:18:58.439 --> 01:19:00.566
May I present Don Don Diego.

01:19:03.444 --> 01:19:06.154
We run a gentleman's game here, Mr. Diego.

01:19:06.239 --> 01:19:09.783
Your, uh, two bodyguards
are completely unnecessary.

01:19:09.867 --> 01:19:11.702
Bodyguards?

01:19:12.703 --> 01:19:14.330
You're mistaken, General.

01:19:14.413 --> 01:19:16.332
This is, um...

01:19:16.415 --> 01:19:20.461
Chimichanga... my loyal manservant.

01:19:22.255 --> 01:19:23.297
God bless you.

01:19:23.881 --> 01:19:24.882
And, um...

01:19:26.925 --> 01:19:28.594
Blanco Beardio.

01:19:29.762 --> 01:19:32.723
He'll be providing the entertainment
for this afternoon's festivities.

01:19:32.806 --> 01:19:34.308
Well, drop me a beat.

01:19:40.314 --> 01:19:41.315
Okay.

01:19:43.025 --> 01:19:44.067
All right.

01:19:46.111 --> 01:19:47.655
Here we go now.

01:19:54.287 --> 01:19:57.623
Gentlemen, the buy-in is $15,000.

01:19:57.706 --> 01:19:59.124
Fifteen large?

01:19:59.207 --> 01:20:00.959
Are you sure General Custard
can swing that?

01:20:01.043 --> 01:20:05.506
It's Custer, not "Custard."
There is no "D." I'm not a dessert.

01:20:05.589 --> 01:20:08.426
Boom, I just dropped some satire
on your ass, General!

01:20:10.052 --> 01:20:11.094
You got me!

01:20:12.638 --> 01:20:15.223
Hey! Now, when Ramon gives
the signal that the time is right,

01:20:15.308 --> 01:20:16.725
that's when we move in.

01:20:16.809 --> 01:20:18.269
You remember the signal, right?

01:20:24.191 --> 01:20:26.569
- Gentlemen.
- You know where to go, Marshal.

01:20:27.152 --> 01:20:28.612
Oh, hell, no!

01:20:28.696 --> 01:20:30.531
That's Wyatt Earp!

01:20:30.614 --> 01:20:32.950
The fastest gun in the West?

01:20:35.578 --> 01:20:36.954
All right, all right, all right!

01:20:37.037 --> 01:20:40.416
- Oh, Wyatt Earp, as I live and breathe!
- Wyatt Earp.

01:20:40.499 --> 01:20:42.209
- You're here!
- Wyatt Earp.

01:20:42.293 --> 01:20:43.711
Sorry I'm late, everybody.

01:20:43.794 --> 01:20:48.006
But apparently, there's some new gang
out there robbing everybody blind.

01:20:48.090 --> 01:20:49.800
Oh, they call themselves
the Ridiculous 6.

01:20:49.883 --> 01:20:53.429
I swear, a man can't ride
five miles in this territory

01:20:53.512 --> 01:20:56.974
without running into outlaws,
rattlesnakes, Injuns and...

01:20:57.057 --> 01:20:59.935
Hey! Why don't you let me
worry about the Injuns?

01:21:00.018 --> 01:21:02.270
Will do, General.

01:21:04.815 --> 01:21:06.024
What's shakin', Twain?

01:21:06.108 --> 01:21:08.694
Hey, I'm good on anything.
Just like gravy, baby.

01:21:08.777 --> 01:21:10.571
- Good to see you, my man.
- You too, man.

01:21:10.654 --> 01:21:13.324
Hey! I finally read <i>Prince and the Pauper.</i>

01:21:13.407 --> 01:21:14.658
Oh, is that right?

01:21:14.742 --> 01:21:15.993
Didn't get it.

01:21:16.994 --> 01:21:18.078
For reals?

01:21:19.204 --> 01:21:22.082
Satire! Boom! I got ya!

01:21:22.165 --> 01:21:25.085
- I'm just pulling your leg.
- Oh, man.

01:21:25.168 --> 01:21:26.629
I can't read.

01:21:29.673 --> 01:21:31.842
Good one with the... satire.

01:21:31.925 --> 01:21:33.677
Funny.

01:21:35.971 --> 01:21:37.014
Who's this idiot?

01:21:39.266 --> 01:21:41.560
Um... I am Don...

01:21:41.644 --> 01:21:43.270
Don Don Diego.

01:21:44.605 --> 01:21:46.607
Well, Don, I'm Wyatt...

01:21:46.690 --> 01:21:47.900
Wyatt Wyatt Earp.

01:21:52.905 --> 01:21:54.573
Got him.

01:21:54.657 --> 01:21:59.370
Now let's play
some cards!

01:22:19.473 --> 01:22:21.392
Please calm yourself!

01:22:22.518 --> 01:22:25.813
Let's get inside before this Wyatt Earp
ruins our plan.

01:22:25.896 --> 01:22:28.315
But there's no way for you to sneak
past them guys, Tommy.

01:22:28.399 --> 01:22:31.652
There's no rocks, no trees,
no nothing to hide behind.

01:22:31.735 --> 01:22:36.198
No need to hide, brother,
when you are friends with the wind.

01:22:36.281 --> 01:22:38.992
I'm telling you, down there,
they don't call it "Mexico."

01:22:39.076 --> 01:22:44.206
It's "Mehico." The "X" is an "H."
I'm presuming Texas is "Tehas."

01:22:45.958 --> 01:22:48.085
Now, what's this?

01:22:48.168 --> 01:22:50.713
Just a tumbleweed,
you jumpy bastard.

01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:09.857
That is some mystical shit.

01:23:13.652 --> 01:23:17.698
I wish to move the dresser
in my bedroom closer to the window,

01:23:17.781 --> 01:23:21.034
but I haven't the strength
to do it myself.

01:23:21.118 --> 01:23:24.872
I'd love to help, ma'am, but I really
should keep playing the piano.

01:23:26.457 --> 01:23:29.710
No one will even know you're gone.

01:23:34.965 --> 01:23:37.801
- Gentlemen, cough up your buy-ins.
- All right!

01:23:37.885 --> 01:23:39.177
Make it rain like Twain.

01:23:39.261 --> 01:23:40.971
- Take that and that.
- Yeah!

01:23:41.054 --> 01:23:44.266
Sure is some good hooch there, Zeke.
Where'd you find that?

01:23:44.349 --> 01:23:48.812
Oh, I got that from a case
about, uh, 20 years ago.

01:23:48.896 --> 01:23:52.357
In fact, uh, you know that shack
up by Jawbone Falls?

01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:54.985
- Yeah.
- There was a lady living there.

01:23:55.068 --> 01:23:57.655
It was one of Frank Stockburn's
many paramours.

01:23:57.738 --> 01:24:02.409
Now this was one of the ugliest ladies
I've ever seen in my life.

01:24:02.493 --> 01:24:04.452
Sounds like a real bucket of turds.

01:24:04.537 --> 01:24:08.624
But she was a very talented
distiller of alcohol.

01:24:08.707 --> 01:24:11.126
So, while she...

01:24:11.209 --> 01:24:14.588
While she's loading up my coach,
her young boy comes out,

01:24:14.672 --> 01:24:20.218
this big shambling oaf,
mute, filthy as a hog,

01:24:20.302 --> 01:24:23.722
and he starts doing
this horrible little tap dance

01:24:23.806 --> 01:24:26.767
whilst singing "The Star-Spangled Banner."

01:24:26.850 --> 01:24:30.145
Well, not singing it, really,
but grunting it, like a caveman!

01:24:30.228 --> 01:24:33.273
<i>? Oh, say can you see?</i>

01:24:35.150 --> 01:24:36.819
You know,
he wants me to throw him some pennies,

01:24:36.902 --> 01:24:38.862
so I fished a coin out of my pocket

01:24:38.946 --> 01:24:40.948
and I guess I don't know my own strength.

01:24:41.031 --> 01:24:44.660
I tossed it, hit him in the mouth,
and knocked his tooth out!

01:24:46.995 --> 01:24:48.413
What an asshole!

01:24:49.998 --> 01:24:50.999
Mama.

01:24:51.625 --> 01:24:55.838
In any event, I still have
one bottle left from that case.

01:24:55.921 --> 01:25:00.551
I'll go fetch it and we can drink a toast
to that awful woman and her hideous son.

01:25:01.969 --> 01:25:05.180
Oh, she was ugly!
You wouldn't even sleep with her.

01:25:09.351 --> 01:25:12.229
Say, Don Don Diego...

01:25:12.312 --> 01:25:13.606
where's your buy-in?

01:25:13.689 --> 01:25:15.482
I thought it was 15 grand a man.

01:25:15.566 --> 01:25:16.734
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:25:16.817 --> 01:25:18.026
Uh...

01:25:27.077 --> 01:25:28.746
Let's see. Ah!

01:25:42.593 --> 01:25:43.594
It's you!

01:25:43.677 --> 01:25:44.803
Uh-huh.

01:25:54.813 --> 01:25:55.981
What?

01:25:56.690 --> 01:25:58.609
What "what"?

01:25:58.692 --> 01:26:00.568
What are you so surprised about?

01:26:00.653 --> 01:26:05.407
Just so surprised at all the...
the fun that we're having here,

01:26:05.490 --> 01:26:07.785
with the card and the money
and the booze and...

01:26:09.953 --> 01:26:13.040
You know, I make that same face when
I put my cologne on in the morning,

01:26:13.123 --> 01:26:15.208
especially when I'm home alone.

01:26:15.292 --> 01:26:16.543
You know what I think?

01:26:16.627 --> 01:26:20.338
I think Don Don Diego isn't really
a coffee bean rancher at all.

01:26:20.422 --> 01:26:24.092
And his true purpose here is to rob us.

01:26:26.386 --> 01:26:29.097
Don't make me kill you, Mr. Earp.

01:26:29.181 --> 01:26:30.849
Hands up high.

01:26:30.933 --> 01:26:33.894
Oh, snap!
You got the drop on Wyatt Earp?

01:26:33.977 --> 01:26:37.522
It's <i>mi hermano.</i>
He's one bad <i>hombre.</i>

01:26:40.776 --> 01:26:42.194
No disrespect, fellas.

01:26:42.277 --> 01:26:45.656
We're gonna have to tie you up,
and we'll have to borrow your horses.

01:26:46.865 --> 01:26:48.491
Ooh, what'd I miss?

01:26:50.118 --> 01:26:53.163
Sweet Hog Rock,
here we come!

01:26:56.583 --> 01:26:58.752
Giddy up, Burro.

01:26:58.836 --> 01:27:00.045
Come on, Ramon!

01:27:13.892 --> 01:27:15.518
Right behind you, Tommy!

01:27:16.519 --> 01:27:19.022
Hurry up, Burro!
Move your ass!

01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:26.910
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.

01:27:29.825 --> 01:27:31.869
Yeah, I think we found it.

01:27:31.952 --> 01:27:36.081
That is one sweet hog right there.

01:27:36.164 --> 01:27:39.877
That is a sweet, majestic hog.

01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:42.295
Yeah, that's a sweet one for sure.

01:27:43.255 --> 01:27:44.381
It's all right.

01:27:46.049 --> 01:27:50.053
I'm confused.
I don't see a hog or a pig anywhere.

01:27:50.137 --> 01:27:53.724
All I see is the big old rock
that looks like a weenie pee-pee.

01:27:58.020 --> 01:28:00.773
- Oh, you guys call a pee-pee a "hog."
- Yeah.

01:28:00.856 --> 01:28:03.650
- That's weird. I like it, though.
- Yeah. Okay.

01:28:03.734 --> 01:28:06.444
Problem is, I don't see
no singing windmill anywhere.

01:28:06.528 --> 01:28:08.405
Wait...

01:28:08.488 --> 01:28:09.572
I hear it.

01:28:10.824 --> 01:28:12.492
Yeah, it's coming from over there.

01:28:12.575 --> 01:28:15.662
Ah! Daddy! Daddy!

01:28:16.329 --> 01:28:18.498
Daddy!
Huh?

01:28:18.581 --> 01:28:19.666
Whoa...

01:28:20.793 --> 01:28:23.796
We're saved! We're saved!

01:28:25.422 --> 01:28:28.926
Oh, it's just these assholes.

01:28:29.009 --> 01:28:30.718
What the hell happened to you guys?

01:28:30.803 --> 01:28:37.184
We was headed west to Frisco
after we absconded with your loot.

01:28:39.269 --> 01:28:41.814
But we ran into these real bad characters.

01:28:41.897 --> 01:28:45.525
It was Cicero something
and his crazy-ass gang.

01:28:46.777 --> 01:28:49.321
Cicero was here?
Then he left?

01:28:49.404 --> 01:28:53.075
He left us in the dirt for fun.

01:28:53.158 --> 01:28:54.701
Ow! Ow, ow!

01:28:55.410 --> 01:28:56.453
Who does that?

01:28:56.536 --> 01:28:58.872
Sicko!

01:29:00.582 --> 01:29:03.794
If this is where the singing windmill is,
then why would they just up and leave?

01:29:03.877 --> 01:29:07.297
Maybe that Stickie McSchnickens guy
was just pulling our leg.

01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:10.592
They went north...
about two hours ago.

01:29:10.675 --> 01:29:11.885
Oh, yeah! Tommy can track 'em.

01:29:11.969 --> 01:29:13.887
Let's saddle up.
We're burning daylight.

01:29:13.971 --> 01:29:15.013
Wait!

01:29:15.097 --> 01:29:17.557
You can't just leave us here,
you gotta get us out!

01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:19.101
You don't need to... Hey, hey, hey!

01:29:19.184 --> 01:29:20.352
We still got the money!

01:29:20.435 --> 01:29:23.355
Yeah, I hid it in my pants.
We'll give it back to ya!

01:29:23.438 --> 01:29:24.898
We don't need no more.
Let's go!

01:29:26.984 --> 01:29:29.527
Hey! Can you at least
help me pick these ants

01:29:29.611 --> 01:29:32.239
out of my beard before you head out?

01:29:32.322 --> 01:29:33.573
Please?

01:29:33.656 --> 01:29:36.159
Tell you what,
we'll dig you up on one condition.

01:29:36.243 --> 01:29:38.578
You say it, we'll do it!

01:29:38.661 --> 01:29:40.998
That you give up your lives of crime

01:29:41.081 --> 01:29:44.376
and take this second chance to start
doing good by people.

01:29:44.459 --> 01:29:46.836
- I'd rather die!
- Hell, no! I ain't doing that!

01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:49.297
No way! Dumb Indian half!

01:29:50.257 --> 01:29:51.591
That was a joke!
That was a joke!

01:29:51.674 --> 01:29:53.969
I'll be a good boy!
I'll be a good boy, Daddy!

01:30:02.394 --> 01:30:04.396
Now what?
East or west?

01:30:04.479 --> 01:30:05.563
Whoa.

01:30:18.118 --> 01:30:20.078
Late in the day.

01:30:20.162 --> 01:30:22.747
Lot of traffic been going through here.

01:30:22.830 --> 01:30:24.416
It's going to take a minute.

01:30:24.499 --> 01:30:27.544
Well, we must be getting mighty close.

01:30:27.627 --> 01:30:30.713
They'd better be treating Dad well,
or they're gonna have to answer to us.

01:30:30.797 --> 01:30:32.549
There he is.

01:30:32.632 --> 01:30:33.926
There's the man himself.

01:30:34.009 --> 01:30:35.885
- Look at that handsome <i>hombre.</i>
- Yeah.

01:30:35.969 --> 01:30:38.096
That's where we get our good looks.

01:30:38.180 --> 01:30:40.348
Let me see ol' Pop.

01:30:52.945 --> 01:30:54.988
Does he still
look like that, Tommy?

01:30:56.073 --> 01:30:57.157
Tommy?

01:30:58.116 --> 01:30:59.617
Yeah, he does.

01:31:00.785 --> 01:31:03.413
Let's set up camp tonight.
Right out there.

01:31:03.496 --> 01:31:04.831
But we can't waste any time.

01:31:04.914 --> 01:31:08.085
Chico... I can't figure it out right now.

01:31:08.168 --> 01:31:09.336
I gotta...

01:31:09.419 --> 01:31:11.421
Just give me till sunrise.
Let me think.

01:31:41.326 --> 01:31:42.660
<i>Dear brothers,</i>

01:31:42.744 --> 01:31:47.040
<i>by the time you read this,
I will have caught up with Dad.</i>

01:31:47.124 --> 01:31:50.918
<i>And I'm sure you're sore at me
for sneaking out on you.</i>

01:31:51.003 --> 01:31:56.758
<i>But this fellow, Cicero, who took Pa,
also took my mother's life,</i>

01:31:56.841 --> 01:31:59.886
<i>and I mean to make him pay for that.</i>

01:31:59.969 --> 01:32:01.929
<i>Things might get messy.</i>

01:32:02.014 --> 01:32:05.225
<i>I can live
with all the bad stuff we've done,</i>

01:32:05.308 --> 01:32:10.772
<i>the hold-ups, the burglaries,
the accidental decapitation,</i>

01:32:10.855 --> 01:32:15.235
<i>but I couldn't live with myself
if something happened to one of you.</i>

01:32:15.318 --> 01:32:20.490
<i>So stay put and I'll be back with Dad
as soon as I can.</i>

01:32:20.573 --> 01:32:22.450
<i>And if I don't come back,</i>

01:32:22.534 --> 01:32:26.663
<i>know that I love you boys
with all my heart.</i>

01:32:26.746 --> 01:32:29.249
<i>Your brother, Tommy.</i>

01:32:43.888 --> 01:32:45.223
Whoa.

01:32:54.316 --> 01:32:56.359
<i>Down at Silver Canyon...</i>

01:32:56.443 --> 01:32:58.903
Meeting Betty Dunson...

01:32:58.986 --> 01:33:02.199
was the luckiest thing
that ever happened to me.

01:33:04.367 --> 01:33:06.411
Mom was his biggest score.

01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:09.081
Hyah.

01:33:17.172 --> 01:33:18.173
Here we are.

01:33:18.256 --> 01:33:20.550
We'd better not have come
all this way for nothing.

01:33:20.633 --> 01:33:23.553
- I want the money, Frank.
- I know what you want.

01:33:24.512 --> 01:33:26.306
There's your money.

01:33:26.389 --> 01:33:27.557
Count it.

01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:29.392
Tommy!

01:33:29.476 --> 01:33:30.768
Oh, look who showed up.

01:33:30.852 --> 01:33:34.272
I didn't know if somebody
dug up what you buried, Pa,

01:33:34.356 --> 01:33:36.941
so I wanted to make sure
you were covered either way.

01:33:37.024 --> 01:33:38.860
Thank you, son.

01:33:38.943 --> 01:33:40.653
Well, ain't that a good boy.

01:33:40.737 --> 01:33:42.364
That's my boy.

01:33:42.447 --> 01:33:44.866
Well, it's been a pleasure, Frank.

01:33:44.949 --> 01:33:46.701
But, uh...

01:33:46.784 --> 01:33:48.035
we'll be on our way.

01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:49.871
Not so fast.

01:33:49.954 --> 01:33:52.999
You and me got some unfinished business.

01:33:53.082 --> 01:33:55.293
No, our business is done.

01:33:55.377 --> 01:33:59.131
Pa... you remember how I told you Ma died?

01:33:59.214 --> 01:34:00.215
Yeah.

01:34:00.298 --> 01:34:04.051
Well, the son of a bitch who shot her...

01:34:04.136 --> 01:34:06.263
had a tattoo on his hand...

01:34:08.431 --> 01:34:10.475
just like Cicero here.

01:34:11.393 --> 01:34:13.645
What, you mean...

01:34:13.728 --> 01:34:15.438
my little horseshoe?

01:34:15.522 --> 01:34:17.732
That's always brought me luck.

01:34:18.316 --> 01:34:20.777
Especially when I was shooting somebody.

01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:24.071
Well, killer, your luck just ran out.

01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:27.784
Your hand touch that knife, boy,

01:34:27.867 --> 01:34:30.245
it'll be the last thing you ever touch.

01:34:30.328 --> 01:34:32.664
Oh, I ain't using these knives.

01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:35.417
No.

01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:37.710
Not for my mama.

01:34:37.794 --> 01:34:41.964
I saved a special one just for you.

01:34:56.313 --> 01:34:58.481
Now you die, Injun-lover.

01:35:01.609 --> 01:35:03.570
He dies, you die.

01:35:06.281 --> 01:35:10.285
Fourteen of us, six of you.
Doesn't seem quite fair, does it?

01:35:10.368 --> 01:35:12.704
Make that twelve of us.

01:35:17.375 --> 01:35:18.376
Twelve of us!

01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:25.258
I ain't sign up for this shit.

01:35:57.915 --> 01:35:59.125
You seeing this?

01:35:59.208 --> 01:36:00.835
- It's not working.
- What are you doing?

01:36:00.918 --> 01:36:02.795
Don't look like a tumbleweed at all, Herm.

01:36:02.879 --> 01:36:04.213
Herm, come back!
Come back, Herm.

01:36:05.673 --> 01:36:08.468
All right, all right.
Now, everybody just calm down.

01:36:08.551 --> 01:36:12.680
A man's entitled...
to kill his mother's killer.

01:36:12.764 --> 01:36:18.436
Plus... that's one less guy
you've got to split the money with!

01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:21.273
Good thinking, Frank.
Let's ride!

01:36:21.356 --> 01:36:23.608
- Yeah!
- Yeah, get on out of here!

01:36:26.319 --> 01:36:30.407
Good job, son.
I'm really proud of you.

01:36:30.490 --> 01:36:34.494
And getting your friends to come
all the way out here with you, brilliant.

01:36:34.577 --> 01:36:39.541
Well, sir...
they ain't just my friends, they, uh...

01:36:39.624 --> 01:36:40.667
They're my brothers.

01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:48.841
Five?

01:36:48.925 --> 01:36:51.010
You had fun, didn't you, sir?

01:36:53.596 --> 01:36:56.599
Well, I'm gonna introduce myself.

01:36:56.683 --> 01:36:58.851
I think they'd like that.

01:37:03.981 --> 01:37:07.610
Frank Stockburn, your dad.

01:37:09.612 --> 01:37:12.740
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:37:12.824 --> 01:37:14.617
- Father.
- Son.

01:37:16.911 --> 01:37:18.955
This is my burro.

01:37:19.038 --> 01:37:21.040
Proud to know you, Burro.

01:37:22.959 --> 01:37:24.251
He's proud.

01:37:24.336 --> 01:37:27.672
You must be, uh,
Saint Louis, right?

01:37:27.755 --> 01:37:29.006
Chico.

01:37:29.090 --> 01:37:32.259
Boy, you got your mom's muscles.

01:37:33.511 --> 01:37:34.929
You a prizefighter?

01:37:36.305 --> 01:37:39.266
No, actually, I'm a...
piano player.

01:37:39.351 --> 01:37:40.977
Oh, well, I'll be!

01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:44.897
You know, I've been known
to tickle the ivories myself.

01:37:44.981 --> 01:37:46.983
Now and then, you know.

01:37:47.066 --> 01:37:49.318
We should play together sometime.

01:37:51.237 --> 01:37:53.072
I'd like that, Dad.

01:37:53.155 --> 01:37:54.991
I'd like that a lot.

01:37:55.074 --> 01:37:56.659
Yeah, son, we'll do that.

01:38:07.294 --> 01:38:09.714
You must be Delilah's boy.

01:38:11.758 --> 01:38:15.344
Boy, she made some fine,
fine whiskey.

01:38:15.428 --> 01:38:16.638
Ooh, yeah.

01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:22.477
She must've been really hitting it hard
when she was pregnant with you.

01:38:32.236 --> 01:38:34.030
Atta boy, atta boy.

01:38:34.739 --> 01:38:36.908
Da-da.

01:38:36.991 --> 01:38:39.035
And, uh... you are?

01:38:39.118 --> 01:38:42.955
I'm Lil Pete. I'm your son!
I love you so much, Dad!

01:38:43.039 --> 01:38:44.874
- I have three nipples.
- Yeah, well...

01:38:44.957 --> 01:38:46.876
It's always good to have a spare.

01:38:48.753 --> 01:38:51.172
- Gall dang, you have one, too?
- Yeah.

01:38:51.255 --> 01:38:53.007
Do you like to play with the extra one?

01:38:53.090 --> 01:38:54.551
Oh, you betcha.

01:38:54.634 --> 01:38:57.219
Oh, Pa, I have a question for you.

01:38:57.303 --> 01:38:58.721
Yeah.

01:38:58.805 --> 01:39:01.724
Where do babies come from?

01:39:01.808 --> 01:39:05.437
Well, son, the mom just poops 'em out.

01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:08.981
I knewed it!
I knewed it, Dad!

01:39:10.483 --> 01:39:12.777
Well, look at this handsome devil.

01:39:12.860 --> 01:39:15.321
Sir, I'm Danny.

01:39:15.404 --> 01:39:17.449
It's awful nice to finally meet ya.

01:39:17.532 --> 01:39:20.076
Could you help me with a problem?

01:39:20.159 --> 01:39:22.119
I did a real stupid thing

01:39:22.203 --> 01:39:26.791
that inadvertently led to the death
of a United States President,

01:39:26.874 --> 01:39:30.920
and I'm feeling pretty lousy about it.

01:39:32.589 --> 01:39:34.924
Well, son...

01:39:35.007 --> 01:39:36.468
look in my eyes.

01:39:38.761 --> 01:39:40.638
Shit happens.

01:39:41.931 --> 01:39:43.683
Yeah.

01:39:43.766 --> 01:39:46.018
Yeah, right.

01:39:46.102 --> 01:39:48.395
Thanks. Thank you, sir.

01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:49.856
You're welcome.

01:39:49.939 --> 01:39:53.067
So, where to now, huh?

01:39:53.150 --> 01:39:56.696
Well, sir, Smoking Fox and me
are getting married in a few days,

01:39:56.779 --> 01:40:00.032
and Screaming Eagle's
walking her down the aisle,

01:40:00.116 --> 01:40:03.285
and I was hoping...

01:40:03.369 --> 01:40:05.747
you could be there, next to me.

01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:08.541
Oh, you mean your best man?

01:40:08.625 --> 01:40:10.042
Yes, sir.

01:40:10.126 --> 01:40:11.919
Oh, Tommy...

01:40:12.003 --> 01:40:14.631
You know, that's...
that's quite an honor.

01:40:14.714 --> 01:40:17.258
- It would be my honor, sir.
- Yeah. Well, uh...

01:40:20.427 --> 01:40:23.430
But unfortunately, I...

01:40:23.515 --> 01:40:26.893
I got some business up north
that I gotta attend to.

01:40:26.976 --> 01:40:30.021
I gotta collect some gambling debts and...

01:40:30.104 --> 01:40:33.816
You know,
just to pay the doctors and such.

01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:37.361
Say, Dad. You don't ever gotta worry
about money ever again.

01:40:37.444 --> 01:40:40.156
We had to conjure up 50 grand twice!

01:40:40.239 --> 01:40:42.199
So we ended up with 100!

01:40:43.325 --> 01:40:44.565
- A hundred?
- Yes, sir.

01:40:44.619 --> 01:40:46.829
There's another 50 grand?

01:40:46.913 --> 01:40:48.665
Yes, sir.

01:40:48.748 --> 01:40:51.584
Right here,
in the burro's saddlebag.

01:40:52.126 --> 01:40:56.798
So that business can wait up north,
can't it... best man?

01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:02.679
Well, now that you mention it,
maybe I should change my plans.

01:41:02.762 --> 01:41:05.431
<i>- Bueno. Bueno.</i>
- Yeah.

01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:13.105
Hey! What are they doing back?

01:41:19.278 --> 01:41:20.780
What is this?

01:41:21.698 --> 01:41:24.450
I guess it's time you kids

01:41:24.533 --> 01:41:29.163
learned the truth
about your dear old dad, huh?

01:41:29.246 --> 01:41:32.709
I'm just too famous.

01:41:32.792 --> 01:41:35.920
I can't walk into any town
west of the Rockies

01:41:36.003 --> 01:41:38.756
without someone calling the law.

01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:43.219
So, I came up with a way
we could make 50 grand

01:41:43.302 --> 01:41:45.387
without lifting a finger.

01:41:45.471 --> 01:41:49.350
And you rascals brought us double!

01:41:49.433 --> 01:41:51.769
Are these my kids or what?

01:41:53.062 --> 01:41:54.313
Son of a bitch!

01:41:55.690 --> 01:41:58.275
If our two gangs joined forces,

01:41:58.359 --> 01:42:02.279
there's not a lawman in the West
that would stand up against us.

01:42:02.363 --> 01:42:05.116
What makes you think we'd turn
to a life of crime?

01:42:05.199 --> 01:42:07.118
'Cause it's in your blood.

01:42:07.201 --> 01:42:09.161
Answer me something.

01:42:09.245 --> 01:42:14.792
Were you ever great at anything
in your life besides stealing?

01:42:16.628 --> 01:42:18.170
No. No.

01:42:18.254 --> 01:42:22.091
You apples didn't fall far from this tree.

01:42:22.174 --> 01:42:24.510
Don't deny who you are.

01:42:24.593 --> 01:42:27.263
If you knew who we really were,

01:42:27.346 --> 01:42:29.974
you'd be very scared right now.

01:42:32.559 --> 01:42:35.187
Don't overplay your hand, son.

01:42:36.773 --> 01:42:39.025
I'm still holding an ace.

01:42:48.409 --> 01:42:50.577
I found her. I...

01:42:50.662 --> 01:42:52.121
I told you I'd find her.

01:42:56.417 --> 01:43:00.922
This little beauty stumbled into our camp
a few days ago.

01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:06.093
She actually tried to rescue me.

01:43:06.177 --> 01:43:11.057
I'm guessing this means you don't want
me to be your best man no more, huh?

01:43:13.976 --> 01:43:17.021
Well, I'm gonna make this
real simple for you.

01:43:18.314 --> 01:43:24.486
Hand over the other 50 grand...
in that stupid ass' saddlebag,

01:43:24.570 --> 01:43:29.909
or I put a bullet
in her pretty Apache head.

01:43:32.829 --> 01:43:34.080
That ain't gonna happen.

01:43:34.789 --> 01:43:36.123
Oh, it ain't?

01:43:36.207 --> 01:43:37.499
No, sir.

01:43:38.459 --> 01:43:39.711
Why's that?

01:43:39.794 --> 01:43:42.671
Mmm... kind of a secret.

01:43:42.755 --> 01:43:46.843
Well, you can tell your old man,
can't ya?

01:43:49.804 --> 01:43:51.764
You know that bag...

01:43:51.848 --> 01:43:54.266
- your boy's holding?
- Uh-huh.

01:43:54.934 --> 01:43:56.728
It was meant for Cicero.

01:43:56.811 --> 01:43:59.814
So there's something special in there.

01:43:59.897 --> 01:44:02.358
- Plan B.
- Plan B?

01:44:02.441 --> 01:44:03.609
Plan B.

01:44:03.692 --> 01:44:05.444
Give me that bag.

01:44:13.202 --> 01:44:14.703
Oh, shit!

01:44:29.426 --> 01:44:30.706
Where is she?

01:44:41.355 --> 01:44:43.357
Smoking Fox.

01:44:54.994 --> 01:44:56.745
Nighty-night, son.

01:45:04.670 --> 01:45:07.965
Danny, are you all right?

01:45:09.758 --> 01:45:12.678
You done good, Daniel.
You saved me.

01:45:14.430 --> 01:45:16.849
It's my duty, Mr. President.

01:45:20.519 --> 01:45:21.979
Mrs. Lincoln.

01:45:23.439 --> 01:45:25.607
Come on! Come on!
Come here.

01:45:30.612 --> 01:45:31.655
Get in.

01:45:52.801 --> 01:45:53.928
I got one!

01:45:54.011 --> 01:45:55.596
Clem, you almost shot me!

01:45:55.679 --> 01:45:57.139
Come on, get the horses!

01:45:57.223 --> 01:46:00.017
My ass! My ass!

01:46:03.145 --> 01:46:04.646
Hey!

01:46:04.730 --> 01:46:08.192
Is this here still valid,
or is it too burnt up?

01:46:08.275 --> 01:46:09.818
Let me take a look here.

01:46:09.902 --> 01:46:11.988
Uh, that looks good to me.
I mean, this looks good.

01:46:12.071 --> 01:46:13.072
What in the hell?

01:46:13.155 --> 01:46:15.616
You didn't scoop yours out,
did you?

01:46:18.827 --> 01:46:20.121
What was the question again?

01:46:20.204 --> 01:46:22.206
What?

01:46:22.289 --> 01:46:24.333
Did any of you really do it?

01:46:29.463 --> 01:46:31.924
Well, then whose eyes are in that jar?

01:46:32.008 --> 01:46:33.217
Uh...

01:46:33.300 --> 01:46:36.720
Well, Babyface found some rocks,
and, uh, painted them.

01:46:36.803 --> 01:46:38.597
Surprise?

01:46:52.236 --> 01:46:55.531
Hey, Tom,
you wanna play a game

01:46:55.614 --> 01:47:00.119
to make up for all the father-son time
we missed?

01:47:00.202 --> 01:47:01.787
Peek-a-boo.

01:47:08.585 --> 01:47:10.421
Hey, come over here!

01:47:10.504 --> 01:47:12.298
No, come over there!

01:47:18.095 --> 01:47:20.806
You could have had everything, son.

01:47:20.889 --> 01:47:23.559
But you had to do the right thing.

01:47:26.395 --> 01:47:30.399
Let me leave you
with a bit of fatherly advice.

01:47:31.692 --> 01:47:36.905
Never bring a knife to a gunfight.

01:47:36.989 --> 01:47:39.992
One day,
there will be too many, my love.

01:47:40.076 --> 01:47:41.285
But not today.

01:47:56.342 --> 01:47:58.970
That was some mystical shit.

01:48:04.350 --> 01:48:05.851
Tommy.

01:48:05.934 --> 01:48:09.313
You knew Cicero killed my mother.

01:48:09.396 --> 01:48:11.232
No!

01:48:11.315 --> 01:48:12.649
No, I didn't know that.

01:48:12.733 --> 01:48:14.360
No more lies!

01:48:15.194 --> 01:48:17.571
Yeah, I knew. I knew.

01:48:17.654 --> 01:48:19.573
Your mother insisted on telling.

01:48:19.656 --> 01:48:23.077
She was going to rat the whole gang out,
and I tried to convince her...

01:48:24.703 --> 01:48:27.956
Tommy, look, I'm your father,
for God's sake.

01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:30.167
You don't kill your father, Tommy.

01:48:36.340 --> 01:48:39.176
His name is White Knife.

01:48:45.641 --> 01:48:47.684
I ain't gonna kill you.

01:48:49.895 --> 01:48:53.649
'Cause my true father taught me otherwise.

01:49:07.163 --> 01:49:09.206
You can't leave me like this!

01:49:12.043 --> 01:49:13.169
Tommy!

01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:16.963
You can't leave me here alone!

01:49:50.372 --> 01:49:54.376
<i>Dear Mama, so much has changed
since my last letter.</i>

01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:56.378
<i>I scarcely know where to begin.</i>

01:49:56.462 --> 01:50:01.675
<i>First off, it turns out our daddy
is a bad, bad man,</i>

01:50:01.758 --> 01:50:03.969
<i>and he got thrown in jail.</i>

01:50:08.432 --> 01:50:13.395
<i>But it's okay, 'cause Screaming Eagle,
the Indian chief who raised Tommy,</i>

01:50:13.479 --> 01:50:15.814
<i>said he'd be all our dads, too.</i>

01:50:23.780 --> 01:50:26.492
<i>I really like it here in this village.</i>

01:50:26.575 --> 01:50:30.162
<i>Our new brothers and sisters
love to have fun</i>

01:50:30.246 --> 01:50:33.457
<i>and have been so nice to all of us.</i>

01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:36.627
These white guys cannot dance.

01:50:37.794 --> 01:50:39.796
<i>Danny don't drink
whiskey no more.</i>

01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:41.382
- No.
- Yee-haw!

01:50:42.133 --> 01:50:45.761
<i>And Ramon and Herm
are trying to learn Indian ways.</i>

01:51:00.108 --> 01:51:02.653
<i>Oh, and big news..</i>.

01:51:02.736 --> 01:51:04.905
<i>I finally have a girlfriend,</i>

01:51:04.988 --> 01:51:08.200
<i>and she's much prettier
than a canty-loupe.</i>

01:51:08.284 --> 01:51:10.827
Come on, you two!
You're missing all the fun.

01:51:10.911 --> 01:51:15.040
<i>Anyways, Mama, thanks for raising me.</i>

01:51:15.123 --> 01:51:18.377
<i>Your loving son, Lil Pete,</i>

01:51:18.460 --> 01:51:22.506
<i>proud member of the Ridiculous 6.</i>

01:58:47.033 --> 01:58:48.034
<i>Before you go...</i>

01:58:48.118 --> 01:58:51.162
Two, four, six, eight.

01:58:51.246 --> 01:58:53.456
Who do we appreciate?

01:58:53.539 --> 01:58:56.292
The Stockburns! The Stockburns!

01:58:56.376 --> 01:58:58.962
Yeah! The Stockburns!
