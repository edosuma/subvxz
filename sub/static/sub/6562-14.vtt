WEBVTT

00:09.233 --> 00:10.600
- * PARTY LIKE THE WEEKEND *

00:10.600 --> 00:12.433
* YOU GOT ME THINKING
WE COULD BE A THING, YEAH *

00:12.433 --> 00:14.600
- * WHEN IS GUSTAVO
GONNA GET NEW POSTERS? *

00:14.600 --> 00:17.067
- SERIOUSLY, WHEN IS HE GOING TO
GET RID OF THESE ANCIENT RELICS?

00:17.067 --> 00:19.933
- BOYZCITY, NOW RESIDING
IN MIDDLE-AGED-MANVILLE.

00:19.933 --> 00:21.433
- [laughs]
OH!

00:21.433 --> 00:24.267
AND ANGEL ANGEL.

00:24.267 --> 00:26.333
- ACTUALLY...
- YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT BAD...

00:26.333 --> 00:27.833
- I WOULD DEFINITELY
TAKE HER OUT.

00:27.833 --> 00:29.833
- AND SHOULDN'T THE BOYZ
IN THE ATTIC POSTER

00:29.833 --> 00:31.533
BE IN THE ATTIC BY NOW?

00:31.533 --> 00:34.700
- YOU KNOW WHAT? IT IS TIME
FOR A NEW POSTER AROUND HERE.

00:34.700 --> 00:37.633
AND I THINK IT SHOULD BE
BIG TIME--WHO ARE THEY?

00:37.633 --> 00:40.067
- * WE COULD BE ON
TO SOMETHING SO GOOD *

00:40.067 --> 00:43.000
- AND WHO'S SINGING OUR SONG?

00:43.000 --> 00:45.833
- *I KNOW YOU KNOW *

00:45.833 --> 00:47.300
* I KNOW YOU KNOW WE KNOW *

00:47.300 --> 00:49.500
* WE GOT SOMETHING *

00:49.500 --> 00:52.433
- LADIES, THAT SOUNDED AMAZING.

00:52.433 --> 00:54.167
- UH, WHAT IS THAT?

00:54.167 --> 00:56.233
- [together] AND WHY ARE THEY
SINGING OUR SONG?

00:56.233 --> 00:59.800
- THAT IS KAT'S CREW,
MY NEW GIRL GROUP.

00:59.800 --> 01:02.933
AND IT'S NOT YOUR SONG ANYMORE.

01:02.933 --> 01:04.267
IT'S THEIRS.

01:04.267 --> 01:08.067
girls: * AH, AH, AH-AH, OH *

01:08.067 --> 01:10.067
- * MAKE IT COUNT,
PLAY IT STRAIGHT *

01:10.067 --> 01:11.900
* DON'T LOOK BACK,
DON'T HESITATE *

01:11.900 --> 01:16.067
- * WHEN YOU GO BIG TIME *

01:16.067 --> 01:17.967
- * WHAT YOU WANT,
WHAT YOU FEEL *

01:17.967 --> 01:19.900
* NEVER QUIT
AND MAKE IT REAL *

01:19.900 --> 01:22.700
- * WHEN YOU ROLL BIG TIME *

01:22.700 --> 01:24.167
- * OH-OH, OH-OH *

01:24.167 --> 01:25.900
- * HEY, HEY *

01:25.900 --> 01:27.900
- * LISTEN TO YOUR HEART NOW *

01:27.900 --> 01:29.867
- * HEY, HEY *

01:29.867 --> 01:32.067
- * DON'T YOU FEEL THE RUSH *

01:32.067 --> 01:33.867
- * UH-OH, UH-OH *

01:33.867 --> 01:35.067
* UH-OH, UH-OH *

01:35.067 --> 01:36.067
- * OH *

01:36.067 --> 01:37.400
- * GO AND SHAKE IT UP *

01:37.400 --> 01:39.633
* WHATCHA GOTTA LOSE *

01:39.633 --> 01:41.233
* GO AND MAKE YOUR LUCK *

01:41.233 --> 01:43.733
* WITH THE LIFE YOU CHOOSE *

01:43.733 --> 01:47.367
* IF YOU WANT IT ALL,
LAY IT ON THE LINE *

01:47.367 --> 01:51.900
* IT'S THE ONLY LIFE YOU GOT
SO YOU GOT TO LIVE IT BIG TIME *

01:55.433 --> 01:57.333
- WHAT--WILL YOU GUYS CALM DOWN?

01:57.333 --> 01:59.900
- A GIRL GROUP?
AND THEY GET OUR SONG?

01:59.900 --> 02:01.467
WE LOVE THAT SONG.

02:01.467 --> 02:03.067
- OH, AND THEY HAVE A POSTER
AND WE DON'T?

02:03.067 --> 02:04.800
- WE DESERVE AN EXPLANATION.

02:04.800 --> 02:06.500
- THEY'RE NOT EVEN SIGNED YET.

02:06.500 --> 02:08.467
AND GUSTAVO JUST MADE
THAT POSTER

02:08.467 --> 02:10.600
TO GET KAT SWEET AND HER "CREW"
EXCITED

02:10.600 --> 02:11.867
ABOUT COMING TO ROCQUE RECORDS.

02:11.867 --> 02:13.133
- OH, SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

02:13.133 --> 02:14.933
IS THAT GUSTAVO'S ALREADY
FORGOTTEN ABOUT US

02:14.933 --> 02:15.933
AND HE'S MOVED ON.

02:15.933 --> 02:17.300
all: HMM.
- RELAX.

02:17.300 --> 02:20.133
GUSTAVO IS NOT GOING TO FORGET
ABOUT BIG TIME RUSH.

02:20.133 --> 02:23.367
- YO!
BIG TIME...

02:23.367 --> 02:25.400
BIG TIME...

02:25.400 --> 02:27.233
- RUSH!
- RIGHT.

02:27.233 --> 02:28.667
KICK BACK A WHILE,

02:28.667 --> 02:31.333
'CAUSE KAT'S CREW IS ON FIRE,

02:31.333 --> 02:33.900
AND I WANT TO WORK WITH THEM
A LITTLE LONGER

02:33.900 --> 02:35.500
AND NOT YOU.

02:35.500 --> 02:38.200
- [screams]

02:38.200 --> 02:41.067
- SANDY, THAT IS SO
TOTALLY AWESOME!

02:41.067 --> 02:42.133
- YOU KNOW, I THINK IT IS GREAT

02:42.133 --> 02:44.267
HOW YOU MADE
SOME NEW GIRLFRIENDS ONLINE.

02:44.267 --> 02:47.100
man: YEAH, WELL, I DON'T AGREE.

02:47.100 --> 02:50.700
- SO WE'RE NOT BUYING
PORK BELLIES UNTIL THEY HIT 39,

02:50.700 --> 02:51.600
RIGHT, KATIE?

02:53.067 --> 02:54.833
- MOM, THAT'S MY STOCK BLOG,

02:54.833 --> 02:57.300
AND THE ASIAN MARKETS OPEN
IN 20 MINUTES.

02:57.300 --> 02:59.567
- HONEY, I LOVE YOU,
BUT IT'S ODD

02:59.567 --> 03:01.333
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS
YOUR OWN AGE.

03:01.333 --> 03:03.533
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I'VE GOT TYLER.

03:03.533 --> 03:04.733
[doorbell rings]

03:04.733 --> 03:06.900
- HIDING A BOY FROM
AN OVERZEALOUS STAGE MOM

03:06.900 --> 03:08.267
IS NOT FRIENDSHIP.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.200
- HAVE YOU SEEN TYLER?
WE HAVE AN AUDITION!

03:12.200 --> 03:13.833
- SORRY, HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.

03:13.833 --> 03:16.600
- [squealing]

03:16.600 --> 03:18.400
- OKAY, WHERE IS HE?

03:18.400 --> 03:20.133
[screams]

03:20.133 --> 03:23.533
- SHE WANTS ME TO DO
AN UNDERWEAR COMMERCIAL.

03:23.533 --> 03:25.133
THANKS, KATIE.

03:25.133 --> 03:28.967
- CAN'T YOU AT LEAST FIND ONE
NEW GIRLFRIEND YOUR OWN AGE?

03:28.967 --> 03:30.067
[clattering]

03:30.067 --> 03:31.800
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOU, HUH?

03:31.800 --> 03:34.233
I DON'T SEE YOU "HANGING
WITH GIRLFRIENDS."

03:34.233 --> 03:35.867
- UH, MAYBE BECAUSE I'M CHASING

03:35.867 --> 03:37.300
FOUR BOYS AND A DAUGHTER
ALL DAY,

03:37.300 --> 03:38.867
TRYING TO KEEP THINGS SANE
AROUND HERE.

03:38.867 --> 03:40.333
- [blows raspberry]

03:40.333 --> 03:42.867
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT A LACK
OF INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS

03:42.867 --> 03:45.367
EVENTUALLY LEADS
TO SOCIAL ISOLATION.

03:45.367 --> 03:46.467
YOU'RE BOTH GOING TO GROW OLD

03:46.467 --> 03:47.867
AND LIVE ALONE
WITH A BUNCH OF CATS.

03:47.867 --> 03:49.300
[both gasp]

03:49.300 --> 03:52.100
both: OKAY, LET'S FIND
SOME FRIENDS.

03:52.100 --> 03:53.367
[girls singing]

03:53.367 --> 03:54.900
- *PARTY LIKE THE WEEKEND *

03:54.900 --> 03:56.367
- "KEEP OUT"?

03:56.367 --> 03:57.933
THIS IS OUR STUDIO!

03:57.933 --> 04:01.133
- UGH, AND I HAD A REALLY COOL
VIDEO IDEA FOR THIS SONG TOO.

04:01.133 --> 04:02.667
WE'RE CAPTAINS OF A SPACESHIP,

04:02.667 --> 04:05.167
AND THIS EVIL SPACE VILLAIN
BEAMS US DOWN TO HIS PLANET

04:05.167 --> 04:07.433
AND ZAPS US WITH A DANCE RAY.

04:07.433 --> 04:10.067
BUT WE HIT HIM
WITH OUR SECRET WEAPON.

04:10.067 --> 04:11.533
POW, POW!
POW, POW!

04:11.533 --> 04:13.133
[explosion noises]

04:13.133 --> 04:14.633
AND WE DEFEAT HIM.

04:14.633 --> 04:15.800
- THAT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.300
- HOW DID WE NOT THINK...
- THAT'S GREAT!

04:17.300 --> 04:19.167
- WHICH IS WHY IT SHOULD BE
OUR SONG,

04:19.167 --> 04:20.867
'CAUSE WE SING
WAY BETTER THAN THEM.

04:20.867 --> 04:23.600
OH, AND THEIR POSTER IS STUPID.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.667
[girls clear throats]
[record scratches]

04:25.667 --> 04:28.533
- ONE, THIS IS GOING TO BE
OUR STUDIO SOON.

04:28.533 --> 04:30.700
TWO, WE SING
WAY BETTER THAN YOU.

04:30.700 --> 04:31.800
AND THREE?

04:31.800 --> 04:33.400
all: WHERE'S YOUR POSTER?

04:33.400 --> 04:35.800
- [gasps]
- WHERE IS IT?

04:35.800 --> 04:37.533
- LOGAN?

04:37.533 --> 04:40.467
- WELL, THEY'RE CLEARLY
YOUNGER THAN US...AND GIRLS.

04:40.467 --> 04:42.633
SO BEATING THEM UP
ISN'T AN OPTION.

04:42.633 --> 04:45.267
UH, ACCEPT DEFEAT AND
WELCOME THEM TO ROCQUE RECORDS?

04:45.267 --> 04:47.467
- TELL GUSTAVO TO GIVE US
OUR SONG BACK,

04:47.467 --> 04:48.800
AND WE'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.233
all: FORGET IT.

04:50.233 --> 04:52.600
- WELL, WE'RE BETTER DANCERS
THAN YOU.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.533
- WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT
IN MUSIC VIDEOS

04:54.533 --> 04:57.500
AND IS EXACTLY HOW WE'RE GOING
TO WIN OUR SONG BACK.

05:00.833 --> 05:03.500
- * I KNOW YOU KNOW *

05:03.500 --> 05:07.167
* I KNOW YOU KNOW WE KNOW
WE GOT SOMETHING *

05:07.167 --> 05:08.733
* *

05:08.733 --> 05:11.067
- THEY DANCE BETTER
THAN BIG TIME RUSH,

05:11.067 --> 05:14.167
AND THEY WILL EXCEL IN A VIDEO.

05:14.167 --> 05:15.167
- GREAT.

05:15.167 --> 05:16.900
LADIES, TAKE A BREAK,

05:16.900 --> 05:18.900
AND TAKE A LOOK
AROUND THE STUDIO,

05:18.900 --> 05:21.767
WHICH COULD BE YOURS.

05:24.767 --> 05:25.800
[notes crashing]

05:25.800 --> 05:27.067
[boys yelling]

05:27.067 --> 05:28.533
- LOOKS LIKE THE CATS...

05:28.533 --> 05:30.867
- [together] ARE TAKING OVER
THE DOGHOUSE.

05:30.867 --> 05:32.067
all: MEOW!

05:33.800 --> 05:34.900
- OH, THEY'RE SASSY.

05:34.900 --> 05:36.400
WE'RE NOT GOOD WITH SASSY.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.867
- HEY, WE ARE VERY GOOD
WITH SASSY.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.067
- SO ARE YOU ENJOYING YOUR TIME
AT THE PALMWOODS?

05:43.067 --> 05:44.567
both: YES, WE ARE.

05:44.567 --> 05:46.633
- AND YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR NEW FRIENDS, LIKE US?

05:46.633 --> 05:48.067
both: YES, WE ARE.

05:48.067 --> 05:49.767
- SO WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

05:49.767 --> 05:51.533
both: YES, WE ARE.

05:51.533 --> 05:53.567
- THEY DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH.

05:53.567 --> 05:56.400
- YEAH, I KNOW.

05:56.400 --> 05:59.333
- WE'RE OUT HERE TRYING TO BREAK
INTO THE CIRCUS BUSINESS.

05:59.333 --> 06:01.133
MY MOM'S A MIME, BY THE WAY.

06:03.067 --> 06:04.500
THERE'S NO DRINK THERE, MA!

06:08.767 --> 06:10.367
- HERE'S HOW
IT'S GOING TO GO DOWN.

06:10.367 --> 06:13.167
RED, YOU KEEP
THE GETAWAY CAR IDLING

06:13.167 --> 06:15.667
WHILE BABYFACE KEEPS A LOOKOUT
FOR THE COPPERS.

06:18.067 --> 06:20.933
- AH, GIRLFRIEND SEARCH
GOING WELL?

06:20.933 --> 06:21.933
- IT'S GOING GREAT!

06:21.933 --> 06:23.267
- WE JUST NEED
SOME NORMAL PEOPLE

06:23.267 --> 06:25.067
TO MOVE INTO THE PALMWOODS.

06:25.067 --> 06:27.800
- HI, MY DAUGHTER AND I
ARE NEW HERE,

06:27.800 --> 06:30.833
AND WE HEARD YOU COULD GET
BOCCE BALLS AT THE FRONT DESK?

06:33.867 --> 06:35.067
- HEY.

06:35.067 --> 06:36.667
DO YOU MIND IF MY DAUGHTER
AND I JOIN YOU

06:36.667 --> 06:38.633
FOR A FRIENDLY GAME?

06:38.633 --> 06:40.233
- THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.567
WE'LL MEET YOU THERE.

06:42.700 --> 06:45.167
- HA!
IN YOUR FACE, FUZZBALL.

06:45.167 --> 06:46.700
- TOLD YOU WE COULD BE FRIENDLY.

06:46.700 --> 06:48.567
- [chuckles]

06:48.567 --> 06:50.767
- WE ARE BIG TIME RUSH,

06:50.767 --> 06:53.867
AND WE CAN TOTALLY TAKE
THREE 14-YEAR-OLD GIRLS.

06:56.700 --> 06:58.233
girls: YOU CAN'T HIT US.

06:58.233 --> 06:59.233
boys: WE KNOW.

06:59.233 --> 07:00.867
- JUST GIVE US THE SONG BACK.

07:00.867 --> 07:02.500
IT WAS OURS FIRST.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.700
PLUS, WE HAVE AN AWESOME IDEA
FOR A VIDEO,

07:04.700 --> 07:06.800
WITH VILLAINS AND A SPACESHIP
AND--

07:06.800 --> 07:09.900
[all making sci fi noises]

07:13.733 --> 07:16.767
- THIS MUSIC VIDEO
IS TAKING PLACE IN AN ALLEY,

07:16.767 --> 07:20.500
WITH DANCING, EXPLOSIONS,
AND STARS US, NOT YOU.

07:20.500 --> 07:21.567
[cat snarls]

07:21.567 --> 07:23.500
- YEAH, WELL, THIS SONG
HAS A RAP IN IT,

07:23.500 --> 07:25.633
AND ONLY LO-GAIN KNOWS
WHAT'S WHAT.

07:25.633 --> 07:29.300
- CHECK IT!
AH!

07:29.300 --> 07:31.667
* DON'T WANT TO GET NASTY,
BUT THIS IS HOW IT ROCKS *

07:31.667 --> 07:34.100
* THIS IS BIG TIME RUSH'S HOUSE,
NOT A KITTY LITTER BOX *

07:34.100 --> 07:35.400
* AND YOU GOT POSTERS
ON THE WALL *

07:35.400 --> 07:36.700
*BUT IT AIN'T NO THING *

07:36.700 --> 07:38.567
* 'CAUSE WE GONNA ROCK THIS TOWN
AND... *

07:38.567 --> 07:40.933
PUT POSTERS ON THE WALL...

07:40.933 --> 07:42.800
EVENTUALLY.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.367
* CHICKA, CHICKA, WHAT? *

07:46.533 --> 07:49.567
THERE'S TOO MUCH PRESSURE, OKAY?

07:49.567 --> 07:51.467
- * LISTEN UP NOW,
'CAUSE THIS IS HOW IT GOES *

07:51.467 --> 07:54.067
* THIS IS KAT'S HOUSE NOW
AND NOT THE STUPID BROS' *

07:54.067 --> 07:55.267
* AND I MEAN IT
WHEN I SCREAM IT *

07:55.267 --> 07:56.633
* AND NO NEED
TO READ BETWEEN IT *

07:56.633 --> 07:58.700
* 'CAUSE YOU KNOW
THAT WE ALWAYS ATTACK IT *

07:58.700 --> 08:00.500
* BIG TIME RUSH
IS GONNA END UP *

08:00.500 --> 08:01.867
* LIKE BOYZ IN THE ATTIC *

08:01.867 --> 08:04.767
* JUST ANOTHER DISTANT MEMORY
ON THE WALL *

08:07.067 --> 08:08.067
girls: YOU CAN'T HIT US.

08:09.733 --> 08:10.900
[cat snarls]

08:13.700 --> 08:14.900
[all sigh]

08:14.900 --> 08:18.600
- SO HOW DID BOYZ IN THE ATTIC
END UP, ANYWAY?

08:20.200 --> 08:22.900
- "BOYZ IN THE ATTIC,
ALSO KNOWN AS B.I.A.,

08:22.900 --> 08:25.333
"WAS PRODUCER GUSTAVO ROCQUE'S
FIRST SUCCESSFUL BAND

"BUT QUICKLY FELL OUT OF FAVOR
AND DROPPED FROM THE LABEL

08:28.900 --> 08:31.400
SOON AFTER ROCQUE RECORDS SIGNED
THE GIRL GROUP ANGEL ANGEL."

08:31.400 --> 08:32.700
- THEY'RE JUST LIKE US!

08:32.700 --> 08:34.200
- WHERE ARE THEY NOW?

08:34.200 --> 08:37.600
- UH, "BOYZ IN THE ATTIC
STILL RESIDE IN L.A.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.933
AND ARE WORKING ON A COMEBACK
AT THEIR STUDIO."

08:39.933 --> 08:41.400
- MAP IT!

08:43.500 --> 08:45.567
- ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS THE PLACE?

08:45.567 --> 08:48.900
- ACCORDING TO THE FAN SITE,
WHICH HAS OVER NINE FOLLOWERS.

08:48.900 --> 08:51.700
[distant siren wailing]

08:57.067 --> 08:58.767
- BIG TIME RUSH.

OKAY, THAT IS FIVE GAMES
TO DONUT.

09:42.100 --> 09:43.300
WANT TO GO AGAIN?

09:43.300 --> 09:45.900
- I THINK WE'VE HAD ENOUGH.

09:49.233 --> 09:52.833
- YEAH, YOU MIGHT HAVE COME ON
A BIT TOO STRONG.

09:52.833 --> 09:54.733
- YOU PLAY TO WIN, NOT TO LOSE.

09:56.133 --> 09:58.433
- LOOK, WE HAVEN'T SEEN
YOUR SON.

09:58.433 --> 09:59.567
AND HAS IT OCCURRED TO YOU

09:59.567 --> 10:01.100
THAT HE DOESN'T WANT
TO BE AN ACTOR?

10:01.100 --> 10:03.200
- [gasps]

10:03.200 --> 10:05.633
- OKAY, SHE'S GONE.

10:05.633 --> 10:06.833

10:06.833 --> 10:08.400

FOREVER.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.233
- ONLY EIGHT MORE YEARS,
I PROMISE.

10:16.267 --> 10:19.500
- SO YOU ACTUALLY LIVE
IN AN ATTIC?

10:19.500 --> 10:21.967
- JUST UNTIL OUR COMEBACK
BLOWS UP.

10:21.967 --> 10:23.167
- WHAT?

10:28.067 --> 10:32.367
- YEAH, UM, WHY IS HE READING
A MEDICAL BOOK AND NOT DANCING?

10:32.367 --> 10:34.000
- I ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE A DOCTOR,

10:34.000 --> 10:35.633
SO IF THIS DOESN'T WORK,

10:35.633 --> 10:37.567

- LOOK, WE JUST NEED TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU GUYS.

- WHAT HAPPENED TO B.I.A.
IS THE SAME THING

10:56.467 --> 10:58.367
THAT'S HAPPENING TO B.T.R.

10:58.367 --> 11:00.067
WE WALK INTO THE STUDIO ONE DAY,

11:00.067 --> 11:03.167

NOW, HOW DO WE USE THIS STUFF

- FIRST...

15:54.067 --> 15:57.067
WE EAT THIS FOOD.

- OH, YEAH.

16:04.767 --> 16:07.367
NOW I CAN DANCE.

TO DESTROY ANGEL ANGEL,

16:10.933 --> 16:13.800
WE'D EGG 'EM EVERY TIME
THEY CAME TO THE STUDIO.

16:13.800 --> 16:16.867
- EGGS, GOT IT.
WHAT ELSE?

16:16.867 --> 16:20.200
- NEXT, STAY UP ALL NIGHT,
LIKE WE DID,

16:20.200 --> 16:21.533
PRANK CALLING THEM

16:21.533 --> 16:23.600
SO THEY'RE TOO TIRED
TO SING IN THE MORNING.

16:28.733 --> 16:31.433
WHEN DID YOU FIND TIME
TO PRACTICE YOUR MUSIC?

16:31.433 --> 16:32.733
- THIS ISN'T ABOUT MUSIC.

16:32.733 --> 16:35.067
IT'S ABOUT GETTING RID
OF A GIRL GROUP.

16:35.067 --> 16:40.200
- NOW, HOW MUCH DO YOU GUYS KNOW
ABOUT FLAMING POOP BAGS?

16:40.200 --> 16:42.067

16:44.333 --> 16:45.900
YOU DON'T WANT TO END UP
LIKE THIS, DO YA?

16:45.900 --> 16:48.467
- WE WILL IF WE KEEP ACTING
LIKE THIS.

16:48.467 --> 16:50.967
- HEY, MAN, IT'S KILL
OR BE KILLED IN THIS BUSINESS.

16:50.967 --> 16:53.633
ALL GUSTAVO CARES ABOUT
IS MONEY.

16:53.633 --> 16:56.567
ONCE KAT'S CREW OUTSELLS
BIG TIME RUSH,

16:56.567 --> 17:01.067

SO HUMILIATED

17:21.133 --> 17:23.333

17:24.867 --> 17:27.667
- OKAY, I GUESS WE SHOULD THINK
ABOUT GETTING SOME CATS.

17:29.433 --> 17:31.067
- I JUST STOPPED BY TO SAY

17:31.067 --> 17:32.733
THAT YOU ARE NOT VERY FRIENDLY.

17:32.733 --> 17:34.067
- WE KNOW.

17:34.067 --> 17:35.567
BUT YOUR SON DOESN'T WANT
TO BE AN ACTOR.

17:35.567 --> 17:38.467
SO I THINK IT'S TIME
THAT WE ALL FACE THE FACTS.

17:38.467 --> 17:40.700
- I JUST--

17:40.700 --> 17:42.500
I JUST WANTED SOMETHING SPECIAL
FOR TYLER--

17:42.500 --> 17:44.400
A BETTER LIFE, YOU KNOW?

17:44.400 --> 17:46.600
OH, I JUST SHOULD STOP
THIS INSANITY

17:46.600 --> 17:48.233
AND TAKE TYLER BACK TO INDIANA.

17:49.633 --> 17:51.067
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

17:51.067 --> 17:52.767
I LOVE IT HERE.

17:52.767 --> 17:54.600
- BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE IT
BOTH WAYS.

17:54.600 --> 17:57.467
- WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN LET HIM
HAVE SOME FUN NOW AND THEN.

17:57.467 --> 18:01.067
- HOW ABOUT NO AUDITIONS
BEFORE 3:00 P.M.?

18:01.067 --> 18:02.933
HE GETS SOME FUN TIME,

18:02.933 --> 18:04.867
AND YOU STILL GET A SHOT
AT THE BIG-TIME.

18:06.133 --> 18:08.133
- I COULD USE A BREAK
FROM CHASING HIM.

18:08.133 --> 18:11.567
IN FACT, JUST SITTING WITH YOU
IS NICE.

18:11.567 --> 18:12.900
- THEN IT'S A DEAL.

18:12.900 --> 18:14.667
BUT I'M STILL GOING
TO HIDE TYLER FROM YOU.

18:14.667 --> 18:17.067
- I LOOK FORWARD TO IT.

18:17.067 --> 18:18.433
TYLER?

18:18.433 --> 18:19.700
TYLER!

18:21.600 --> 18:23.833
TYLER!

18:25.600 --> 18:29.333

MADE SOME FRIENDS.

18:29.333 --> 18:31.267
- KATIE, MEET YOU IN THE PARK
FOR SOME BOCCE?

18:31.267 --> 18:32.433
- I'LL BE THERE.

18:36.567 --> 18:39.867
- DOGS!
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

18:39.867 --> 18:41.333
SIT DOWN!

18:41.333 --> 18:43.700
- [whispers]
THIS DOES NOT LOOK GOOD.

18:43.700 --> 18:47.167
- I HAVE SOMETHING I HAVE TO SAY
TO ALL OF YOU.

18:47.167 --> 18:50.500
I LOVE BOTH BANDS
AT THIS TABLE.

18:50.500 --> 18:54.767
BUT I WILL NOT GO THROUGH
WHAT I WENT THROUGH

18:54.767 --> 18:56.700
BACK IN THE '90s!

18:56.700 --> 19:00.267
NOW, KAT'S CREW

BUT...

19:05.267 --> 19:08.267
THE DOGS HAVE ALWAYS
STUCK BY ME,

19:08.267 --> 19:11.967
AND I HAVE TO DO THE SAME
AND STICK WITH THEM...

19:11.967 --> 19:13.900
NO MATTER HOW STUPID THEY ARE!

19:13.900 --> 19:15.900

19:15.900 --> 19:17.667
- YOU GIRLS ARE GREAT,

19:17.667 --> 19:20.333
AND SOMEBODY IS GOING
TO MAKE YOU STARS--

19:20.333 --> 19:21.833
