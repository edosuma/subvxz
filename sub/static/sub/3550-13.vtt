WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.103
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.103 --> 00:03.634
PRINCIPAL HOBSON JUST CALLED,

00:03.634 --> 00:07.007
AND JUANITA GOT ACCEPTED
TO OAKRIDGE.
 THERE WAS ACCEPTANCE...

00:07.007 --> 00:10.010
I LIKE THE BLUNT ANA
MORE THAN THE CUTE ANA.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.213
SO YOU THINK I'M CUTE?

00:12.213 --> 00:14.645
A PLEA...
 YOU HAVE TO LET ME HELP YOU,
OR I AM--

00:14.645 --> 00:17.448
OR YOU WON'T GET INTO HEAVEN?

00:17.448 --> 00:19.690
A BREAKDOWN...
 DID YOU STAB YOURSELF?

00:19.690 --> 00:22.623
I HAVE TO GET TO MIKE!
 (man) WHOA! WHOA! WHOA!

00:22.623 --> 00:25.126
NO!
 AND A CONFRONTATION.

00:25.126 --> 00:28.429
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FEEL,
LYNETTE,

00:28.429 --> 00:32.703
BECAUSE YOU NEVER TALK ABOUT IT!
 WE LOST A KID. HOW CAN SAYING
THIS OUT LOUD BE HELPFUL?

00:36.607 --> 00:38.609
(Mary Alice)
IF YOU WANT TO THROW

00:38.609 --> 00:40.111
A SUCCESSFUL DINNER PARTY,

00:40.111 --> 00:43.514
THERE ARE CERTAIN RULES
THAT MUST BE FOLLOWED.

00:43.514 --> 00:46.177
IF THE GOOD SILVER IS USED,

00:46.177 --> 00:48.479
IT MUST BE POLISHED.

00:48.479 --> 00:50.651
IF MUSIC IS PLAYED,

00:50.651 --> 00:53.454
THE VOLUME SHOULD BE LOW.

00:53.454 --> 00:55.786
IF THE GUESTS BRING WINE,

00:55.786 --> 00:58.389
IT MUST BE SERVED.

00:58.389 --> 01:01.832
AND IF THE EVENING
IS TO BE TRULY SUCCESSFUL...

01:01.832 --> 01:03.194
(laughter)

01:03.194 --> 01:05.336
THERE MUST BE A TOAST.

01:05.336 --> 01:08.139
TO LEE. THIS DINNER
HAS BEEN A TOTAL TRIUMPH.

01:08.139 --> 01:09.640
(Lynette and Bob) AW.

01:09.640 --> 01:11.302
(clink)
 (Lynette) OH, BOB!

01:11.302 --> 01:14.074
AND IT'S NOT OVER YET.
I MADE A FRUIT TART FOR DESSERT.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.376
OOH!

01:15.376 --> 01:17.448
AND IN CASE ANY OF YOU
ARE DIABETIC,

01:17.448 --> 01:20.581
LET ME JUST SAY...
IT WAS NICE KNOWING YOU.
 (both laugh)

01:20.581 --> 01:25.156
NO. SERIOUSLY, THIS IS HOW
WE LOST HIS COUSIN.

01:25.156 --> 01:27.158
HEY, BOB,
WHERE'S THE WHIPPED CREAM?

01:27.158 --> 01:28.589
OH. I TOTALLY FORGOT.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.592
I WAS ON MY PHONE AND I DROVE
RIGHT PAST THE STORE.

01:31.592 --> 01:34.094
OF COURSE, BECAUSE IT'S
SOMETHING THAT I NEEDED.

01:34.094 --> 01:37.768
I WAS WORKING ALL DAY.
IF IT WAS THAT IMPORTANT,

01:37.768 --> 01:39.770
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST GO OUT
AND GET IT?

01:39.770 --> 01:42.433
UH, I WORK, TOO.
SELLING HOUSES IS WORK.
 HOUSE.

01:42.433 --> 01:45.406
HE'S SOLD ONE HOUSE
IN SIX MONTHS.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.538
ATTACKING.

01:47.538 --> 01:48.839
(knife clatters)

01:50.741 --> 01:52.883
WHAT--WHAT'S THAT?

01:52.883 --> 01:55.316
MY FEELINGS JOURNAL.

01:57.488 --> 01:59.820
LEE AND I ARE SEEING
THIS COUNSELOR.

01:59.820 --> 02:02.393
SHE HAS US WRITE DOWN
OUR NEGATIVE FEELINGS

02:02.393 --> 02:05.396
TO DISCUSS IN OUR SESSIONS.

02:05.396 --> 02:08.399
SEEMS LIKE YOU GOT
A LOT OF FEELINGS THERE, LEE.

02:08.399 --> 02:10.901
THAT'S VOLUME THREE,
WITH AN ENTIRE CHAPTER

02:10.901 --> 02:13.864
ABOUT ME FORGETTING
TO PUT DOWN THE TOILET SEAT.

02:13.864 --> 02:15.836
I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE
THE ONE ADVANTAGE

02:15.836 --> 02:18.539
WITH TWO GUYS LIVING TOGETHER.

02:18.539 --> 02:20.911
YOU'D THINK.

02:22.713 --> 02:25.876
WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT
YOU'RE--YOU'RE GETTING HELP.

02:25.876 --> 02:29.650
YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD THINK
ABOUT SEEING SOMEONE.
 WHAT?

02:29.650 --> 02:32.183
YOU KNOW, TO HELP US
WITH OUR STUFF.

02:32.183 --> 02:34.685
CAN WE TALK
ABOUT OUR STUFF LATER?

02:34.685 --> 02:36.827
WE COULD, BUT YOU WON'T.

02:36.827 --> 02:38.158
(chuckles)

02:38.158 --> 02:40.831
SHE--SHE NEVER WANTS TO TALK.
 (teacup clatters)

02:40.831 --> 02:43.934
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT THERAPY.

02:43.934 --> 02:46.437
IT'S FOR WEAK, INDULGENT...

02:48.339 --> 02:51.642
STRAIGHT PEOPLE.
YOU GUYS TOTALLY MAKE IT WORK.

02:51.642 --> 02:53.944
I USED TO FEEL THE SAME WAY
ABOUT THERAPY.

02:53.944 --> 02:56.547
BUT THIS LADY--
SHE'S REALLY GREAT.

02:56.547 --> 02:58.249
VOLUME THREE?

02:58.249 --> 03:00.311
CAN'T WE GIVE IT A TRY?

03:00.311 --> 03:03.314
I DON'T NEED SOMEONE TELLING ME
HOW I FEEL, OKAY?

03:03.314 --> 03:05.316
SO COULD WE JUST DROP IT?

03:07.788 --> 03:12.923
AND THE NUMBER ONE RULE
FOR A SUCCESSFUL DINNER PARTY?

03:12.923 --> 03:15.526
AFTER DESSERT, LET'S KARAOKE!

03:15.526 --> 03:19.230
KEEP DISCUSSION
OF YOUR MARRIAGE

03:19.230 --> 03:21.902
TO AN ABSOLUTE MINIMUM.

03:32.983 --> 03:35.916
DR. BRENT AVEDON
WAS THE HEAD OF PSYCHOLOGY

03:35.916 --> 03:39.250
AT THE FAIRVIEW HEALTH CENTER.

03:39.250 --> 03:43.954
HE SPENT HIS DAYS TREATING
ANTISOCIAL ADOLESCENTS,

03:43.954 --> 03:47.998
DELUSIONAL DOWAGERS...

03:47.998 --> 03:50.761
AND BIPOLAR BUSINESSMEN.

03:50.761 --> 03:52.933
(sobbing)

03:52.933 --> 03:56.837
BUT LATELY,
HIS MOST INTERESTING PATIENT

03:56.837 --> 03:59.270
WAS A HOUSEWIFE

03:59.270 --> 04:02.973
WHO'D HAD A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.

04:02.973 --> 04:06.347
I WAS JUST SO LONELY.

04:06.347 --> 04:08.349
AND THEN ONE DAY,

04:08.349 --> 04:11.352
ALONG CAME
THIS WONDERFUL MAN--

04:11.352 --> 04:13.954
A MAN WHO MADE ME LAUGH,

04:13.954 --> 04:16.927
WHO GAVE ME HOPE AGAIN...

04:18.728 --> 04:23.964
AND WHO TURNED OUT TO BE
IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

04:23.964 --> 04:27.938
SO I WENT BACK
TO BEING LONELY.

04:27.938 --> 04:32.343
ONLY IT WAS WORSE NOW
BECAUSE...

04:32.343 --> 04:33.844
HE WASN'T REALLY GONE.

04:33.844 --> 04:36.977
HE WAS ACROSS THE STREET,

04:36.977 --> 04:38.949
HOLDING HER HAND,

04:38.949 --> 04:41.452
LAUGHING WITH HER.

04:42.913 --> 04:47.057
SO ONE DAY...

04:47.057 --> 04:49.059
I PRETENDED,

04:49.059 --> 04:52.963
JUST FOR A SECOND...

04:52.963 --> 04:57.398
THAT IT WASN'T HER HAND
HE WAS HOLDING.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.574
IT WAS MINE.

05:03.574 --> 05:06.036
HMM.

05:06.036 --> 05:08.409
AND THAT'S HOW
THE FANTASIES STARTED?

05:11.482 --> 05:12.983
WHEN I WAS HURTING,

05:12.983 --> 05:17.488
I WOULD LET MYSELF IMAGINE
THAT HE WAS THERE WITH ME.

05:19.089 --> 05:23.093
BUT THEN THOSE MOMENTS
STARTED TO...

05:23.093 --> 05:26.927
(voice breaks) M-MEAN MORE
TO ME THAN WHAT WAS REAL.

05:26.927 --> 05:30.861
SO...

05:30.861 --> 05:32.863
I JUST LET MYSELF HAVE THEM.

05:32.863 --> 05:35.636
I LET THEM TAKE OVER.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.107
WHAT ABOUT NOW?

05:37.107 --> 05:40.611
DO YOU FEEL THAT THE MEDICATION
IS HELPING YOU?

05:40.611 --> 05:43.614
(laughs)

05:45.716 --> 05:50.821
WELL, I CERTAINLY HAVE
A FIRMER GRASP ON REALITY NOW.

05:50.821 --> 05:52.483
I CAN SEE THINGS,

05:52.483 --> 05:54.955
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN A LONG WHILE,

05:54.955 --> 05:57.988
VERY CLEARLY.

05:57.988 --> 05:59.590
THAT'S GREAT.

05:59.590 --> 06:02.393
NO. (laughs)

06:02.393 --> 06:04.935
NOT REALLY.

06:04.935 --> 06:10.040
BECAUSE NOW I CAN SEE
WHAT I'VE DONE TO MY LIFE.

06:10.040 --> 06:12.503
AND...

06:12.503 --> 06:15.075
(sighs)

06:15.075 --> 06:17.778
HOW I'VE RUINED IT.

06:19.810 --> 06:22.012
(man on TV shouts indistinctly,
trumpet plays "Charge")

06:22.012 --> 06:26.056
OKAY, ORSON, IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO GIVE YOU YOUR BATH.
 NOT NOW.

06:26.056 --> 06:29.119
(horses galloping)

06:29.119 --> 06:31.862
ORSON, YOU HAVEN'T BATHED
IN OVER A WEEK.

06:31.862 --> 06:34.865
NOW I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS
ANY MORE THAN YOU DO,

06:34.865 --> 06:36.867
BUT FRANKLY,
YOU'RE GETTING A LITTLE RIPE.

06:36.867 --> 06:39.399
I SAID I DON'T WANT
A BATH.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.572
WELL, IT'S NOT ABOUT
WHAT YOU WANT ANYMORE.

06:41.572 --> 06:43.734
IT'S A MATTER
OF PRESERVING THE DRAPES.

06:43.734 --> 06:48.439
TO HAVE ANOTHER HUMAN BEING
BATHE ME IS HUMILIATING.

06:48.439 --> 06:49.910
HERE.

06:49.910 --> 06:53.083
(blows air) WHAT'S THIS?
 A LIST OF THINGS
I NEED AT THE STORE.

06:53.083 --> 06:56.186
I JUST WENT TO THE STORE FOR YOU
AN HOUR AGO. CAN'T IT WAIT?

06:56.186 --> 06:59.049
NO. I NEED THESE ITEMS
IMMEDIATELY.

06:59.049 --> 07:00.451
IT'S URGENT.

07:00.451 --> 07:03.854
ORSON,
HOW ARE CornNuts URGENT?

07:06.056 --> 07:07.958
I'M SORRY, BREE.

07:07.958 --> 07:10.961
I JUST THOUGHT THAT SINCE
YOU PLAYED A MAJOR PART

07:10.961 --> 07:12.963
IN PUTTING ME IN THIS CHAIR,

07:12.963 --> 07:16.707
YOU'D WANT TO PLAY A SMALL PART
IN MAKING MY NEW LIFE TOLERABLE.

07:19.009 --> 07:20.671
GIVE ME THE LIST.

07:22.072 --> 07:23.974
(clears throat) BETTER YET,

07:23.974 --> 07:27.678
LEAVE IT ON THE TABLE
AND THEN BACK AWAY.

07:33.684 --> 07:35.526
HEY, TEACH.

07:35.526 --> 07:37.928
HI!

07:37.928 --> 07:40.791
I JUST DROPPED OFF JUANITA
FOR HER FIRST DAY.

07:40.791 --> 07:42.462
SHE'S A LITTLE NERVOUS.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.965
AW, SHE'S GONNA LOVE IT HERE.
THE TEACHERS ARE GREAT.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.838
SO WHAT ANIMAL IS SHE?
 EXCUSE ME?

07:47.838 --> 07:49.840
OH, THEY TEST THE KIDS

07:49.840 --> 07:52.142
AND THEY PLACE THEM IN GROUPS
ACCORDING TO THEIR LEVEL.

07:52.142 --> 07:54.104
IN MATH, THERE'S LEOPARDS,
CHIPMUNKS, GIRAFFES.

07:54.104 --> 07:56.507
IT SHOULD BE IN HER FOLDER.

07:56.507 --> 07:59.149
OH, SHE'S A LEOPARD.

07:59.149 --> 08:01.181
OH.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.984
WHAT'S M.J.?

08:03.984 --> 08:05.516
HE'S A GIRAFFE.

08:05.516 --> 08:07.918
OH. SO...

08:07.918 --> 08:09.920
WHICH IS THE ADVANCED GROUP?

08:09.920 --> 08:12.162
NO ONE KNOWS.

08:12.162 --> 08:13.724
THEY WON'T EVEN TELL ME.

08:13.724 --> 08:16.026
PRINCIPAL HOBSON FEELS
THAT IF THE PARENTS FIND OUT,

08:16.026 --> 08:19.029
THEY'LL FREAK
AND GET ALL COMPETITIVE.

08:19.029 --> 08:21.672
(laughs) THAT'S CRAZY.

08:21.672 --> 08:23.073
WHO CARES?

08:23.073 --> 08:25.776
EXACTLY. (chuckles)

08:28.038 --> 08:30.641
LEOPARDS ARE THE MORONS,
AREN'T THEY?

08:30.641 --> 08:33.544
NO. I-I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

08:33.544 --> 08:35.044
YEAH, YOU DID.

08:35.044 --> 08:38.048
WHEN I ASKED ABOUT M.J.,
YOU WERE LIKE, "HE'S A GIRAFFE!"

08:38.048 --> 08:40.220
AND THEN I SAID
JUANITA WAS A LEOPARD,

08:40.220 --> 08:44.755
AND YOU WERE LIKE, "OH."
 YOU'RE JUST JUMPING
TO CONCLUSIONS.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.198
YOU KNOW SOMETHING.

08:48.198 --> 08:49.730
SPILL IT!

08:49.730 --> 08:51.802
(sighs) OKAY.

08:51.802 --> 08:54.905
UH, I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE,

08:54.905 --> 08:58.038
BUT I TEACH THESE KIDS,
AND IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.971
WE WERE MAKING
PAPIER-MâCHé GLOBES...

09:00.971 --> 09:02.673
THIS...

09:02.673 --> 09:04.314
IS RACHEL MILLER.

09:04.314 --> 09:06.076
DAMN, THAT'S GOOD.

09:06.076 --> 09:08.148
HUH.
 SHE'S A GIRAFFE.

09:08.148 --> 09:11.281
AND THIS IS WENDY BENSON.

09:11.281 --> 09:12.983
OKAY.

09:12.983 --> 09:14.084
CHIPMUNK.

09:15.285 --> 09:19.259
AND THIS ONE WAS MADE
BY ADAM HUNTER--

09:19.259 --> 09:20.861
A LEOPARD.

09:20.861 --> 09:24.735
MY GOD, IT LOOKS LIKE
AN ACTUAL LEOPARD MADE IT.

09:24.735 --> 09:25.966
(sighs)

09:25.966 --> 09:28.268
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH BEING A LEOPARD.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.941
THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT HERE.

09:30.941 --> 09:33.073
THEY...
MOVE THE CAFETERIA TABLES,

09:33.073 --> 09:35.205
EXCELLENT DOOR HOLDERS.

09:35.205 --> 09:37.247
THIS ISN'T FAIR.

09:37.247 --> 09:39.950
GABY, W-WE HAVE A SAYING
AROUND HERE.

09:39.950 --> 09:42.613
"IT'S THE PACE,
NOT THE RACE."

09:42.613 --> 09:44.785
I KNOW MY DAUGHTER.
SHE IS ALL GIRAFFE.

09:44.785 --> 09:47.758
I'M GONNA GO TALK
TO THE PRINCIPAL.
 (door thuds)

09:47.758 --> 09:49.119
UM...

09:49.119 --> 09:51.091
Y-Y-YOU DON'T PUSH.
YOU...

09:51.091 --> 09:54.324
(door unlatches)

09:54.324 --> 09:57.868
SORRY. MY DAUGHTER WASN'T HERE
TO HOLD IT FOR ME.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.033
(kisses)

10:03.033 --> 10:04.735
JEEZ, LYNETTE!
 (chuckles)

10:04.735 --> 10:07.177
DINNER'S READY. GO WASH UP.

10:07.177 --> 10:08.979
WHAT IS THAT?

10:08.979 --> 10:12.112
IT'S NOTHING. IT'S, UH--
IT'S, UH... IT'S PERSONAL.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.114
PERSONAL?

10:14.114 --> 10:16.016
YES.

10:16.016 --> 10:18.018
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

10:18.018 --> 10:20.020
THAT WE RESPECT
EACH OTHER'S BOUNDARIES.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.152
THIS MORNING, YOU WALKED IN
AND SAT ON THE TOILET

10:22.152 --> 10:24.154
WHILE I SHAVED MY LEGS.

10:24.154 --> 10:26.056
WE HAVE NO BOUNDARIES.

10:26.056 --> 10:28.398
ATTACKING.
 WHAT?

10:28.398 --> 10:31.662
YOU SOUND JUST LIKE BOB AND--
OH! OH! OH, MY GOD!

10:31.662 --> 10:33.664
IS THAT A FEELINGS JOURNAL?

10:33.664 --> 10:35.866
IF YOU MUST KNOW,
YES, IT IS.

10:35.866 --> 10:38.669
I STARTED SEEING
THEIR THERAPIST.

10:38.669 --> 10:42.172
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?
 BECAUSE I WANTED
TO TALK TO SOMEONE,

10:42.172 --> 10:44.174
AND I DIDN'T NEED
YOUR RIDICULE.

10:44.174 --> 10:47.147
ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT THE BABY?

10:47.147 --> 10:49.149
IT STARTED OUT ABOUT THAT.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.822
BUT NOW WE'RE ON TO, UM...
OTHER THINGS.

10:51.822 --> 10:54.184
OTHER THINGS?
YOU MEAN LIKE ME?

10:54.184 --> 10:57.227
I MIGHT'VE MENTIONED YOU
ONCE OR TWICE.

10:57.227 --> 10:59.229
ONCE OR TWICE? UH-HUH.

10:59.229 --> 11:02.332
I BET IF WE DOWNED A SHOT EVERY
TIME WE READ THE NAME "LYNETTE,"

11:02.332 --> 11:04.865
WE'D BE HAMMERED BY PAGE TWO.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.096
(chuckles)

11:06.096 --> 11:08.198
LET ME SEE THAT.

11:08.198 --> 11:10.440
OH, NO, NO. NO WAY.

11:10.440 --> 11:12.743
(chuckles)

11:12.743 --> 11:15.776
BUT IF YOU'RE REALLY INTERESTED
IN WHAT'S IN HERE,

11:15.776 --> 11:17.908
YOU CAN ALWAYS JOIN ME
IN THERAPY.

11:17.908 --> 11:19.880
LIKE HELL.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.452
FINE.

11:22.452 --> 11:26.717
THEN I GUESS YOU'LL JUST
HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE MOVIE.

11:36.026 --> 11:38.298
(singsongy) HERE WE GO.

11:38.298 --> 11:41.732
THANKS AGAIN FOR HAVING ME.
THIS ALL LOOKS DELICIOUS.

11:41.732 --> 11:43.734
(normal voice) OH,
IT'S YOUR FIRST NIGHT OVER.

11:43.734 --> 11:45.736
I WANTED TO MAKE YOU
A TRADITIONAL ITALIAN MEAL--

11:45.736 --> 11:48.108
RIGATONI WITH SAUSAGE,
CHICKEN PARM.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.240
JUST SALAD WOULD BE GREAT.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.242
OH, SCREW THE SALAD.
THAT CAME OUT OF A BAG.

11:52.242 --> 11:54.344
THIS RIGATONI
CAME FROM MY HEART.

11:54.344 --> 11:58.118
TO BE HONEST,
I DON'T EAT CARBS.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.120
OH, BUT YOU'LL
MAKE AN EXCEPTION TONIGHT

12:00.120 --> 12:02.422
'CAUSE I'VE BEEN SWEATIN'
OVER THE STOVE ALL DAY.

12:02.422 --> 12:05.155
MA, LET IT GO.
SHE'S WATCHING HER WEIGHT.

12:05.155 --> 12:07.257
HER WEIGHT? IF I PUT
THE AIR CONDITIONER ON HIGH,

12:07.257 --> 12:09.259
IT'LL BLOW HER
ACROSS THE ROOM.

12:09.259 --> 12:11.261
I JUST HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.

12:11.261 --> 12:13.934
AS SOON
AS A GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL,

12:13.934 --> 12:17.507
I'M GOING TO NEW YORK
TO BE A MODEL.
 OH. NO COLLEGE?

12:17.507 --> 12:20.771
ARE YOU KIDDING? AND MISS
MY PRIME MODELING YEARS?

12:22.773 --> 12:27.447
WHAT? I THINK IT'S GREAT.
IT TAKES GUTS TO FOLLOW A DREAM.

12:27.447 --> 12:31.051
YEAH, IT'S GREAT,
BUT IT'D BE NICE

12:31.051 --> 12:33.283
TO HAVE SOMETHING OTHER
THAN THE PORN INDUSTRY

12:33.283 --> 12:36.156
TO FALL BACK ON.
 MA.

12:36.156 --> 12:38.158
WHAT? I'M NOT SAYING
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

12:38.158 --> 12:42.132
BUT, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF MODELS
DO END UP THAT WAY.
 I KNOW IT'S RISKY,

12:42.132 --> 12:44.865
BUT I'M REALLY PASSIONATE
ABOUT THIS.

12:44.865 --> 12:47.898
AND I THINK THAT THE BEST WAY
TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN LIFE

12:47.898 --> 12:49.900
IS TO DO WHAT
YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT.

12:49.900 --> 12:53.303
THAT'S WHY I KEEP TELLING DANNY
TO PURSUE HIS POETRY.

12:53.303 --> 12:55.175
POETRY?

12:55.175 --> 12:57.147
YEAH. IT'S AMAZING, RIGHT?

12:57.147 --> 12:59.009
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

12:59.009 --> 13:01.411
I'M TOO BUSY COOKING FOOD
NOBODY'S GONNA EAT.

13:01.411 --> 13:04.114
DANNY, WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER
SHOW ME YOUR POETRY?

13:04.114 --> 13:06.016
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

13:06.016 --> 13:07.487
DANNY, IT'S GREAT.

13:07.487 --> 13:10.490
I KEEP TELLING HIM HE SHOULD
COME TO NEW YORK WITH ME

13:10.490 --> 13:13.193
SO HE CAN REALLY FOCUS
ON HIS WRITING.

13:13.193 --> 13:16.166
WOW. A MODEL AND A POET.

13:16.166 --> 13:19.469
SO WHILE YOU'RE DOIN' PORN,
HE CAN MAKE THE DIALOGUE RHYME.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.105
THIS IS WHY
I DON'T TELL HER STUFF.

13:27.878 --> 13:29.809
OKAY.

13:29.809 --> 13:33.043
I'M SORRY. I WAS JUST
TRYING TO MAKE A JOKE.

13:33.043 --> 13:35.115
LET'S GET BACK TO DINNER,
HUH?

13:35.115 --> 13:36.586
OH, NO. I'M GOOD.

13:36.586 --> 13:38.118
(clears throat)

13:38.118 --> 13:40.350
CARBS. MNH-MNH.

13:44.254 --> 13:47.928
OH, I'LL BE OUT
RUNNING ERRANDS TODAY,

13:47.928 --> 13:50.260
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO LET
THE PHYSICAL THERAPIST IN

13:50.260 --> 13:52.262
WHEN SHE ARRIVES.

13:52.262 --> 13:53.603
HMM.

13:53.603 --> 13:55.065
WHAT'S WRONG?

13:55.065 --> 13:56.937
THERE'S NO STRAWBERRIES.

13:56.937 --> 13:59.239
YOU KNOW I LIKE STRAWBERRIES
WITH MY WAFFLES.

13:59.239 --> 14:02.612
I AM SORRY. THEY'RE RIGHT HERE.
THERE YOU GO.

14:02.612 --> 14:05.876
STRAWBERRIES. ENJOY.

14:05.876 --> 14:07.447
I NEED WHIPPED CREAM.

14:09.179 --> 14:11.181
UNLESS YOU THINK
THE STRAWBERRIES

14:11.181 --> 14:14.284
ARE GONNA MAGICALLY STICK
TO THE WAFFLES BY THEMSELVES.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.128
HMM.

14:26.336 --> 14:28.038
(bowl clanks)

14:35.875 --> 14:38.478
NOT SO FAST.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.210
SAY "PLEASE."

14:40.210 --> 14:43.153
I WILL NOT.
NOW GIVE ME MY BREAKFAST.

14:43.153 --> 14:45.115
ORSON, I AM HAPPY TO DO
WHATEVER YOU ASK,

14:45.115 --> 14:47.117
BUT I WILL NOT TREATED
LIKE A SLAVE.

14:47.117 --> 14:49.189
NOW SAY "PLEASE."

14:54.224 --> 14:56.526
NOW THAT I LOOK
AT YOUR WAFFLE,

14:56.526 --> 14:59.930
I UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU'RE SO EAGER TO HAVE IT.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.435
BREE...

15:05.435 --> 15:09.339
YOU KNOW THE MAGIC WORD.
(whispers) IT HAS SIX LETTERS.

15:09.339 --> 15:11.341
I KNOW A WORD
THAT HAS THREE.

15:11.341 --> 15:14.514
IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME MY FOOD,
I'M GONNA SHOVE THAT FORK UP IT.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.286
(gasps)

15:16.286 --> 15:17.347
MMM.

15:17.347 --> 15:18.648
MMM! MMM!

15:18.648 --> 15:21.651
YOU CAN HAVE IT WHEN
YOU'RE READY TO BE POLITE.

15:28.198 --> 15:30.700
MR. HOBSON, MY DAUGHTER
IS INCREDIBLY BRIGHT.

15:30.700 --> 15:34.004
I JUST NEED TO KNOW IF SHE'S
IN THE ADVANCED CLASSES.

15:34.004 --> 15:37.067
YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE A POLICY
NOT TO DISCLOSE THAT.

15:37.067 --> 15:39.069
OH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SAY ANYTHING.

15:39.069 --> 15:41.211
JUST BLINK WHEN I MENTION
THE SMART GROUP. LEOPARD.

15:41.211 --> 15:43.673
MRS. SOLIS--
 WAIT, WAS THAT A BLINK
OR A TWITCH?

15:43.673 --> 15:45.675
I CAN'T TELL.
YOU SEEM VERY NERVOUS.

15:45.675 --> 15:49.149
YOU SEE, THIS IS EXACTLY WHY
WE DON'T TELL THE PARENTS.

15:49.149 --> 15:53.723
THEY START BEHAVING
IRRATIONALLY.

15:53.723 --> 15:58.258
AND STOP TRYING TO READ THINGS
ON MY DESK UPSIDE-DOWN.

15:58.258 --> 16:01.131
WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?
I JUST NEED TO KNOW

16:01.131 --> 16:03.333
IF MY DAUGHTER'S GONNA
SUCCEED IN LIFE.
 SHE'S 7.

16:03.333 --> 16:05.595
NOW I SUGGEST
THAT YOU STOP PRYING

16:05.595 --> 16:10.300
AND JUST BE PROUD OF HER
NO MATTER WHAT GROUP SHE'S IN.

16:10.300 --> 16:14.374
I AM PROUD OF HER,
AND I DON'T PRY.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.306
(sighs)

16:16.306 --> 16:20.210
BY THE WAY, ENJOY
YOUR COLONOSCOPY ON THE 16th.

16:20.210 --> 16:21.451
(door slams)

16:21.451 --> 16:26.186
(children shouting, laughter)

16:26.186 --> 16:28.218
MOM. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:28.218 --> 16:30.220
I WAS JUST HAVING
A NICE GET-TO-KNOW-YOU CHAT

16:30.220 --> 16:32.522
WITH THE PRINCIPAL.
WHO ARE YOUR FRIENDS?

16:32.522 --> 16:35.025
UM, THIS IS WENDY AND RACHEL.

16:35.025 --> 16:36.496
WE'RE IN MATH TOGETHER.

16:36.496 --> 16:40.200
OH! WAIT A MINUTE.
I THINK I SAW YOUR ART PROJECTS.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.372
WENDY,
YOU'RE A CHIPMUNK, RIGHT?

16:42.372 --> 16:44.474
AND, RACHEL, YOU'RE A GIRAFFE?

16:44.474 --> 16:46.306
OH, OKAY.

16:48.278 --> 16:50.780
YOU KNOW WHAT
I WOULD LOVE TO DO?

16:50.780 --> 16:55.215
IS TAKE A PICTURE WITH JUANITA
AND HER FRIENDS.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.717
AND, UH, YOU KNOW WHAT
WOULD BE REALLY CUTE?

16:57.717 --> 17:00.350
IS IF YOU HOLD UP
YOUR MATH HOMEWORK.

17:03.793 --> 17:05.325
(beep, shutter clicks)

17:05.325 --> 17:07.426
(beep, click)

17:07.426 --> 17:09.459
(beep, click)
 GOT IT.

17:09.459 --> 17:11.300
BUT I WASN'T SMILING.

17:11.300 --> 17:13.603
YEAH? WELL,
IT'S A TOUGH WORLD OUT THERE.

17:13.603 --> 17:16.606
NOT MUCH TO SMILE ABOUT.
(singsongy) HAVE A GREAT DAY!

17:16.606 --> 17:20.069
YOUR MOM'S WEIRD.

17:20.069 --> 17:22.541
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

17:25.075 --> 17:27.717
(doorbell rings)

17:32.222 --> 17:34.184
(door creaks)

17:34.184 --> 17:35.655
ORSON?

17:35.655 --> 17:38.728
I'M LETTING MYSELF IN.

17:38.728 --> 17:41.691
TIME FOR YOUR THERAPY.

17:41.691 --> 17:43.533
HELP ME!

17:43.533 --> 17:45.565
OH!

17:45.565 --> 17:48.067
HELP.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.200
OH! DEAR LORD!
 (groaning)

17:50.200 --> 17:51.441
ORSON!

17:51.441 --> 17:53.143
OH!
 WHAT HAPPENED?

17:53.143 --> 17:54.504
OH! JOYCE.

17:54.504 --> 17:55.845
OH!

17:55.845 --> 17:58.348
(panting) WELL, I WAS TRYING
TO GET THOSE WAFFLES,

17:58.348 --> 18:00.410
AND I FELL OUT OF MY CHAIR.

18:00.410 --> 18:03.082
W-W-WHAT ARE THEY DOING
UP THERE?

18:03.082 --> 18:05.685
STARVING HIM?

18:05.685 --> 18:08.258
THAT'S RIDICULOUS. (chuckles)
 REALLY?

18:08.258 --> 18:12.192
SO YOU DON'T TORMENT HIM BY
PUTTING FOOD OUT OF HIS REACH?

18:12.192 --> 18:14.394
OH. WELL, YOU KINDA HAD
TO BE THERE FOR THAT.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.826
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE GET ME
A PIECE OF BREAD?

18:16.826 --> 18:19.699
ORSON, FOR GOD SAKES!
STOP THAT!

18:19.699 --> 18:23.303
PLEASE HIT ME IN THE LEGS THIS
TIME. THERE'S NO FEELING THERE.

18:23.303 --> 18:27.137
MRS. HODGE, MAY I SPEAK TO YOU
PRIVATELY FOR A MOMENT?

18:34.544 --> 18:38.288
YOU--YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.
I WOULD NEVER HIT MY HUSBAND.

18:38.288 --> 18:42.352
I SENSED HIM BEING A LITTLE
DRAMATIC. BUT WITHHOLDING FOOD?

18:42.352 --> 18:46.356
THE WHOLE THING STARTED BECAUSE
HE REFUSED TO SAY PLEASE...

18:46.356 --> 18:49.599
WHICH I KNOW SOUNDS
RATHER PETTY,

18:49.599 --> 18:53.503
BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND.
HE HAS BEEN IMPOSSIBLE LATELY.

18:53.503 --> 18:56.206
THE MAN IS FACING
LIFE IN A WHEELCHAIR.

18:56.206 --> 18:58.208
HE'S MAD AT THE WORLD,

18:58.208 --> 19:00.640
AND UNFORTUNATELY,
HE'S TAKING IT OUT ON YOU.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.343
(groans)

19:03.343 --> 19:05.144
LOOK...
 (sighs)

19:05.144 --> 19:07.317
I KNOW THIS IS NOT EASY.

19:07.317 --> 19:09.279
BUT UNTIL HE COMES
TO ACCEPT THIS,

19:09.279 --> 19:12.151
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO BE MORE PATIENT.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.283
(exhales deeply)

19:13.283 --> 19:17.227
AND IF YOU CAN'T,
IT'S MY OBLIGATION TO REPORT IT.

19:20.590 --> 19:24.234
OH, AND GIVE THE MAN A BATH.

19:24.234 --> 19:26.866
PHYSICAL THERAPY
SHOULDN'T REQUIRE GLOVES.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.301
(sighs)

19:38.908 --> 19:40.810
HEY.
 HEY.

19:40.810 --> 19:42.952
YOU WEREN'T HOME WHEN
THEY TRIED TO DELIVER THIS,

19:42.952 --> 19:46.286
SO I SIGNED FOR IT.
 YEAH, WE JUST--
WE HAD, UH, WE SAW AN AD FOR...

19:46.286 --> 19:49.459
HONEST TO GOD,
DON'T NEED TO KNOW.

19:49.459 --> 19:50.860
GOOD. UM...

19:50.860 --> 19:52.722
AH, LOOK.

19:52.722 --> 19:55.725
(speaking inaudibly)

19:57.267 --> 20:00.400
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY GOT
A NEW GIRLFRIEND.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.502
YEAH, NOT FOR LONG.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.203
I DO NOT APPROVE.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.976
AH. YOU DON'T APPROVE,
AND SHE'S GOT A BODY

20:06.976 --> 20:09.979
THAT WOULD MAKE THE POPE WALK
THROUGH A SLIDING GLASS DOOR.

20:09.979 --> 20:14.414
GOSH, WHO'S GONNA WIN?
 HE IS MY KID. IF I DON'T
THINK SHE IS GOOD FOR HIM,

20:14.414 --> 20:16.916
I WILL DO
WHATEVER I HAVE TO DO.

20:16.916 --> 20:19.919
WHICH WILL DRIVE HIM TOWARDS HER
AND AWAY FROM YOU.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.921
LOOK, I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE

20:21.921 --> 20:24.554
WHEN A MOM HATES THE HOTTIE
HER SON LOVES.

20:24.554 --> 20:26.556
BOB'S MOM HATED ME. UGH.

20:26.556 --> 20:28.658
HUH. I ALWAYS THOUGHT
THAT BOB WAS--

20:28.658 --> 20:30.330
THE POINT IS,

20:30.330 --> 20:34.264
SHE OVERPLAYED HER HAND
AND MADE BOB CHOOSE BETWEEN US.

20:34.264 --> 20:36.266
AND THE LONG STORY SHORT,

20:36.266 --> 20:38.268
I'M CUDDLING UP WITH BOB
EVERY NIGHT.

20:38.268 --> 20:40.270
AND WHERE'S MAMA?
NURSING HOME.

20:40.270 --> 20:42.772
HOW'D SHE GET THERE?
DON'T KNOW. CAN'T REMEMBER.

20:42.772 --> 20:45.445
IT'S JUST...
I DON'T KNOW THIS GIRL.

20:45.445 --> 20:48.948
AND I-I-I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN TRUST HER.
 WELL, THEN YOU BETTER
GET TO KNOW HER.

20:48.948 --> 20:50.950
I'D HATE TO SEE YOU
LOSE YOUR SON

20:50.950 --> 20:53.953
BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID
TO SHARE HIM.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.785
GET OUTTA HERE.

20:55.785 --> 20:57.287
(door closes)

20:58.758 --> 21:01.891
CARLOS, DID YOU GET THE PICTURES
I SENT YOU?

21:01.891 --> 21:03.893
YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL
AS THE DAY WE MET.

21:03.893 --> 21:05.895
TIME HASN'T TOUCHED YOU
AT ALL.

21:05.895 --> 21:08.398
NOT OF ME--
OF THE MATH HOMEWORK.

21:08.398 --> 21:10.269
WHAT?

21:10.269 --> 21:11.641
(beeping)
 HERE.

21:11.641 --> 21:13.643
THIS ASSIGNMENT LOOKS EASY,
DOESN'T IT?

21:13.643 --> 21:15.645
PRETTY BASIC, YEAH.

21:15.645 --> 21:19.278
AND LOOK AT THIS ONE
WITH THE MULTIPLICATION.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.451
LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED,
RIGHT?

21:21.451 --> 21:22.652
I GUESS.

21:22.652 --> 21:25.655
(beep)
 AND THIS ONE...

21:25.655 --> 21:27.757
WORD PROBLEMS. FRACTIONS.

21:27.757 --> 21:30.360
THIS IS THE HARDEST ONE,
ISN'T IT?
 LOOKS LIKE IT. SO?

21:30.360 --> 21:34.293
CARLOS, THIS IS
THE LEOPARD'S HOMEWORK.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.826
WELL, THAT CLEARED THAT UP.

21:36.826 --> 21:38.898
NO. DON'T YOU GET IT?
OUR DAUGHTER IS A LEOPARD.

21:38.898 --> 21:40.900
SHE'S IN THE ADVANCED CLASS.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.933
HEY! GOOD FOR HER.
 (laughs)

21:43.933 --> 21:46.336
OH, POOR SUSAN.

21:46.336 --> 21:48.708
YEAH? WHY?

21:48.708 --> 21:51.381
WELL, SHE WAS CONVINCED
THAT M.J.'s BRILLIANT,

21:51.381 --> 21:53.843
AND IT TURNS OUT
HE'S IN THE SLOW GROUP.

21:53.843 --> 21:56.446
(sighs) I'D HATE
FOR HER TO FIND OUT.

21:56.446 --> 21:59.018
GABY, YOU ARE NOT
TELLING HER.
 WHY NOT?

21:59.018 --> 22:01.090
SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE
TELLING ME

22:01.090 --> 22:04.454
SHE THOUGHT JUANITA WAS ONE
THERMOS SHORT OF A LUNCH BOX.
 SHE SAID THAT?

22:04.454 --> 22:07.627
YES. WITH HER TONE.

22:07.627 --> 22:08.958
MM-HMM.

22:08.958 --> 22:11.330
WELL, WE'VE HAD ENOUGH DRAMA
WITH THE NEIGHBORS LATELY,

22:11.330 --> 22:13.332
SO JUST DROP IT.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.835
FINE, I'LL DROP IT.
BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW,

22:15.835 --> 22:18.337
I LIKE YOU BETTER WHEN
YOU'RE READING THE NEWSPAPER,

22:18.337 --> 22:20.840
PRETENDING TO LISTEN.
 SURE, TAKE WHATEVER YOU NEED.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.341
(scoffs)

22:25.645 --> 22:28.648
(utensils clattering)

22:33.383 --> 22:35.425
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

22:35.425 --> 22:37.657
I TOLD THEM I DON'T WANT
ANY VISITORS.

22:37.657 --> 22:40.590
WHO SAYS I'M VISITING?
MAYBE I'M BONKERS, TOO.

22:42.392 --> 22:43.893
GONNA EAT THE APPLESAUCE?

22:49.138 --> 22:52.502
REMEMBER WHEN MY GOUT FLARED UP
AND I COULDN'T WALK?

22:54.103 --> 22:57.376
AND YOU USED TO
COME OVER TO SEE ME?

22:57.376 --> 22:59.378
I FIGURED I OWE YA.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.380
DEBT PAID. GOOD-BYE.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.453
I SEE YOU GOT
YOUR CHARMING PERSONALITY BACK.

23:05.515 --> 23:08.588
SO... WHEN ARE YOU GONNA BE
COMING BACK HOME?

23:08.588 --> 23:11.591
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I WOULD EVER COME BACK?

23:11.591 --> 23:15.164
AFTER WHAT I DID TO
THOSE PEOPLE? NO. THEY HATE ME.

23:15.164 --> 23:18.428
TAKE IT FROM THE REIGNING
ODD DUCK ON THE LANE--

23:18.428 --> 23:21.170
NOBODY CARES ABOUT
ALL THAT SILLY STUFF.

23:21.170 --> 23:24.173
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT. BREE AND I
CAN JUST LAUGH, LAUGH, LAUGH

23:24.173 --> 23:27.006
ABOUT SILLY ME
NEARLY DESTROYING HER BUSINESS.

23:27.006 --> 23:28.838
AND I'LL TELL SUSAN

23:28.838 --> 23:32.482
THAT I WAS JUST JOSHING ABOUT
TRYING TO WRECK HER MARRIAGE.
 YEAH. OKAY. OKAY.

23:32.482 --> 23:34.744
OH, AND I'LL BET
MIKE IS STILL CHUCKLING

23:34.744 --> 23:36.746
ABOUT ME GETTING HIM THROWN
IN JAIL.

23:36.746 --> 23:39.148
WILL YOU LISTEN?
 KATHY, I'M SERIOUS.

23:39.148 --> 23:40.850
I'M WILLING TO BET

23:40.850 --> 23:43.823
THERE'S MORE FORGIVENESS THERE
THAN YOU IMAGINE.

23:43.823 --> 23:45.855
IN THAT CASE, YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:45.855 --> 23:47.426
WHAT?

23:47.426 --> 23:49.559
MAYBE YOU ARE BONKERS.

23:54.103 --> 23:55.565
(silverware clinks)

23:59.569 --> 24:01.140
HEY, HON.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.212
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

24:03.212 --> 24:06.646
HEY, SUSAN. WHAT'S UP?
 I WAS GOING THROUGH
SOME OF M.J.'s STUFF,

24:06.646 --> 24:08.648
AND I FOUND THESE MATH WORKBOOKS
FROM LAST YEAR.

24:08.648 --> 24:11.080
I THOUGHT JUANITA
WOULD FIND THEM HELPFUL.

24:11.080 --> 24:12.652
(chuckles) WELL...

24:12.652 --> 24:14.484
(mouths word)

24:14.484 --> 24:17.156
THANK YOU.
 (thud)

24:17.156 --> 24:20.029
NO PROBLEM. I THOUGHT
IT MIGHT HELP HER CATCH UP.
 (resumes pounding)

24:22.992 --> 24:24.694
CATCH UP?

24:24.694 --> 24:27.236
YEAH. YOU KNOW,
FROM WHEN SHE WAS OUT OF SCHOOL.

24:27.236 --> 24:30.139
(chuckles) SHE WAS
NEVER OUT OF SCHOOL.

24:30.139 --> 24:32.141
I WAS HOMESCHOOLING HER.

24:32.141 --> 24:34.674
AND I KNOW YOU DID
THE BEST YOU COULD.

24:34.674 --> 24:36.646
BUT NOW SHE HAS
PROFESSIONAL TEACHERS,

24:36.646 --> 24:40.179
AND I BET SHE'S GONNA CATCH UP
TO M.J. IN NO TIME.

24:40.179 --> 24:41.781
(bottle cap pops)

24:41.781 --> 24:43.513
(fizzes)

24:43.513 --> 24:46.656
(whispers) GET HER.

24:46.656 --> 24:48.257
WELL, SUSAN...

24:48.257 --> 24:50.890
AHEM. BY THE WAY,
DID YOU HEAR?

24:50.890 --> 24:53.793
LEOPARDS ARE
THE ADVANCED STUDENTS.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.525
WHAT?

24:55.525 --> 24:57.527
YEAH. IT'S TRUE.
CHIPMUNKS ARE AVERAGE.

24:57.527 --> 24:58.828
AND GIRAFFES--

24:58.828 --> 25:02.271
WELL, THOSE CAFETERIA TABLES
AREN'T GONNA MOVE THEMSELVES.

25:02.271 --> 25:05.204
HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS?

25:05.204 --> 25:07.537
I GOT A COPY
OF EACH GROUP'S HOMEWORK.

25:07.537 --> 25:10.009
TRUST ME.
I CRACKED THE CODE.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.211
SO THAT MEANS THAT M.J.'s
NOT IN THE...

25:12.211 --> 25:14.744
HEY, BUT YOU SAID IT YOURSELF--
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

25:14.744 --> 25:16.746
"IT'S THE PACE, NOT THE RACE,"
RIGHT?

25:16.746 --> 25:18.718
RIGHT.

25:18.718 --> 25:21.220
OH, AND PLEASE,
DON'T SAY ANYTHING TO ANYONE.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.593
YOU KNOW HOW COMPETITIVE
SOME PARENTS CAN GET.

25:23.593 --> 25:26.155
HUH. YEAH.

25:26.155 --> 25:28.297
ALL TOO WELL.

25:38.307 --> 25:41.540
I'M FINISHED. CAN I HAVE
MY MILK AND COOKIES NOW?

25:45.274 --> 25:47.276
SURE, SWEETIE.

25:47.276 --> 25:50.279
YOU HAVE SOME PASTA STUCK
TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF YOUR FACE.

25:52.251 --> 25:56.555
NO, SWEETIE. YOUR RIGHT.

25:56.555 --> 25:59.558
OH, NEVER MIND.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.290
HEY, GUYS.

26:01.290 --> 26:03.262
MIKE, CAN YOU HELP ME
TAKE OUT THE TRASH?

26:03.262 --> 26:04.834
SURE.

26:04.834 --> 26:07.997
(whispers) NEVER MIND THAT.

26:07.997 --> 26:08.998
(sighs)

26:08.998 --> 26:11.570
(chuckles) OKAY,
SO HE'S A GIRAFFE.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.142
YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH BEING AVERAGE.

26:13.142 --> 26:14.644
NO CHIPMUNKS ARE AVERAGE.

26:14.644 --> 26:16.976
HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU?

26:16.976 --> 26:19.248
LEOPARDS,
CHIPMUNKS, GIRAFFES.

26:19.248 --> 26:21.651
(sighs)
I LOVE HIM SO MUCH, MIKE.

26:21.651 --> 26:24.183
WHAT IF HE'S...

26:24.183 --> 26:25.755
SLOW?

26:25.755 --> 26:27.586
(chuckles) HE'S NOT SLOW.

26:27.586 --> 26:31.891
HE'S A SMART, INQUISITIVE,
BRIGHT LITTLE BOY.

26:34.664 --> 26:36.095
OH, NO.

26:38.197 --> 26:43.132
HE'S GOT HIS HAND STUCK
IN THE GLASS.

26:43.132 --> 26:44.634
OH, COME ON, BUDDY.

26:44.634 --> 26:48.277
COME ON.
JUST--JUST HOLD THE GLASS.

26:50.279 --> 26:52.712
PULL WITH THE OTHER HAND.

26:54.283 --> 26:56.816
YOU CAN DO IT.

26:56.816 --> 26:59.989
COME ON, M.J.

26:59.989 --> 27:01.390
YES!

27:01.390 --> 27:03.923
OH! YES!

27:03.923 --> 27:06.255
SEE? YOU WERE WORRIED
ABOUT NOTHING.

27:06.255 --> 27:08.057
YOU'RE RIGHT. OH.

27:08.057 --> 27:10.229
OH, NO.

27:10.229 --> 27:13.733
HE'S HEADING TOWARD THE TOASTER
WITH A FORK!

27:35.024 --> 27:37.026
(Tom) HONEY?

27:37.026 --> 27:39.288
YEAH?
 (clears throat)

27:39.288 --> 27:40.960
HEY.
 HI.

27:40.960 --> 27:43.262
I'M HEADING OUT.
 OKAY. MWAH.
WANNA GRAB LUNCH TODAY?

27:43.262 --> 27:46.265
UH, MAYBE TOMORROW.
I HAVE A-A THING.

27:46.265 --> 27:47.767
IF YOU MEAN THERAPY,

27:47.767 --> 27:50.299
WHY NOT JUST SAY "THERAPY"?

27:50.299 --> 27:53.242
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO GET
INTO A FIGHT. THAT'S ALL.

27:53.242 --> 27:56.075
HEY. WON'T YOU NEED THIS?

27:56.075 --> 27:59.078
AH. RIGHT. THANKS.

27:59.078 --> 28:02.051
DON'T YOU WANNA KNOW
IF I READ IT?

28:02.051 --> 28:05.214
OH. (chuckles)
I'D KNOW IF YOU READ IT.

28:06.786 --> 28:08.157
(door closes)

28:13.322 --> 28:16.325
(telephone ringing)

28:22.301 --> 28:24.934
EXCUSE ME. ARE YOU WAITING
FOR DR. GRAHAM?

28:24.934 --> 28:27.336
DON'T TELL ME
SHE DOUBLE-BOOKED AGAIN.

28:27.336 --> 28:29.338
OH, NO.
I DON'T HAVE AN APPOINTMENT.

28:29.338 --> 28:33.382
BUT I REALLY NEED TO TALK
TO HER, SO CAN I HAVE YOURS?

28:33.382 --> 28:36.315
I DON'T KNOW. I REALLY NEED
TO TALK TO HER, TOO.

28:36.315 --> 28:39.018
SERIOUSLY? BECAUSE I WAS
LOOKING AT YOU THINKING,

28:39.018 --> 28:41.020
WHAT IS HE DOING HERE?

28:41.020 --> 28:43.022
THAT GUY'S
REALLY GOT IT TOGETHER.

28:43.022 --> 28:46.796
THANKS. BUT I'M BEEN HAVING
A PRETTY HARD TIME LATELY.

28:46.796 --> 28:48.898
I'LL GIVE YOU 200 BUCKS.
 CASH?

28:48.898 --> 28:50.900
20s OKAY?

28:50.900 --> 28:53.262
SO, UM...

28:53.262 --> 28:57.266
WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO
TALK TO HER ABOUT?

28:57.266 --> 29:00.509
I'M STARTING TO FEEL THE URGE
TO GAMBLE AGAIN.

29:00.509 --> 29:02.311
THANKS.

29:04.273 --> 29:05.775
(door opens)

29:05.775 --> 29:08.347
MR. JAMESON?

29:08.347 --> 29:10.279
HE HAD TO GO,

29:10.279 --> 29:13.052
BUT HE SAID I COULD HAVE
HIS APPOINTMENT.

29:13.052 --> 29:14.884
UH... (chuckles)

29:14.884 --> 29:17.426
I'M SORRY,
BUT IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT.

29:17.426 --> 29:20.129
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED
IN BECOMING A PATIENT---

29:20.129 --> 29:22.361
I'M NOT.
I AM MRS. TOM SCAVO.

29:24.133 --> 29:26.495
YEP, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

29:30.199 --> 29:32.271
WELL, I DON'T BLAME YOU
FOR REACTING LIKE THAT.
 (door closes)

29:32.271 --> 29:35.875
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE STORIES
TOM'S BEEN READING TO YOU

29:35.875 --> 29:39.478
FROM HIS BIG BOOK OF WAH!

29:39.478 --> 29:42.281
SO... HERE I AM,

29:42.281 --> 29:46.315
TOM SCAVO'S BITCH OF A WIFE,
IN THE FLESH. (chuckles)

29:46.315 --> 29:49.158
WHY DO YOU PUT IT LIKE THAT?

29:49.158 --> 29:51.560
I DON'T KNOW SPECIFICALLY

29:51.560 --> 29:53.222
WHAT WORD HE USES.

29:53.222 --> 29:56.325
I'M JUST PICKING THE ONE
THAT SEEMS THE MOST LIKELY.

29:56.325 --> 30:00.799
SO YOU THINK YOUR HUSBAND
DESCRIBES YOU AS A BITCH?

30:00.799 --> 30:02.331
DOESN'T HE?

30:02.331 --> 30:04.503
WHAT TOM SAYS IN THIS ROOM
IS PRIVATE.

30:04.503 --> 30:07.036
WHICH MEANS YES?

30:07.036 --> 30:10.239
WELL, OBVIOUSLY,
IT DOES TO YOU.

30:10.239 --> 30:12.411
I'M JUST WONDERING
WHY THAT MIGHT BE.

30:12.411 --> 30:16.445
OH, I SEE
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO,

30:16.445 --> 30:18.417
BUT I DID NOT COME HERE
FOR THERAPY.

30:18.417 --> 30:20.449
I CAME HERE TO DEFEND MYSELF.

30:20.449 --> 30:22.451
BECAUSE THERE'S TWO SIDES
TO EVERY STORY.

30:22.451 --> 30:25.124
SO YOU'RE NOT A BITCH?

30:25.124 --> 30:26.926
NOT ALL THE TIME, NO.

30:26.926 --> 30:29.298
BUT SOMETIMES?

30:31.060 --> 30:33.232
I JUST...

30:33.232 --> 30:35.304
NEED...

30:35.304 --> 30:39.338
WANT TO FEEL LIKE
I'M IN CONTROL,

30:39.338 --> 30:41.410
AND WHEN I DON'T,

30:41.410 --> 30:44.113
THAT MAKES ME MAD. AND...

30:44.113 --> 30:46.275
MAYBE I'M MAD A LOT

30:46.275 --> 30:48.277
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'VE NOTICED,

30:48.277 --> 30:52.181
BUT YOU CAN'T CONTROL
WHAT HAPPENS IN LIFE.

30:54.053 --> 30:57.356
LIKE YOUR BABY DYING?

31:05.364 --> 31:08.637
I'M GOING TO SIT DOWN,
BUT ONLY...

31:08.637 --> 31:11.070
(whispers)
BECAUSE I'M TIRED.

31:17.406 --> 31:19.909
UNLESS YOU NEED TO GO
OR SOMETHING.

31:19.909 --> 31:23.312
NO.
I DON'T NEED TO GO ANYWHERE.

31:37.066 --> 31:39.528
HEY.
 HEY.

31:39.528 --> 31:42.972
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

31:42.972 --> 31:44.974
IS THAT A...

31:44.974 --> 31:47.977
YEP. LOOKS LIKE WE'LL BE
GOING TO THERAPY TOGETHER.

31:47.977 --> 31:51.180
REALLY? THAT IS GREAT NEWS.
THANK YOU.

31:51.180 --> 31:52.341
OH.

31:52.341 --> 31:53.382
MM.

31:53.382 --> 31:55.344
MM.

31:55.344 --> 32:00.319
W-WHERE'S DINNER?

32:02.051 --> 32:04.323
I MEAN,
YOU WERE HOME ALL DAY.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.428
(pen clicks)

32:09.428 --> 32:11.560
WHAT ARE YOU WRITING?

32:11.560 --> 32:14.203
YOU'LL FIND OUT,
TUESDAY AT 12:30.

32:16.505 --> 32:18.307
(indistinct conversations)

32:18.307 --> 32:21.340
COLLEEN!
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

32:21.340 --> 32:23.342
UH, I'VE GOT
PARENT-TEACHER CONFERENCES,

32:23.342 --> 32:26.145
BUT NOT FOR A FEW MINUTES.
WHAT'S UP?

32:26.145 --> 32:29.148
IT'S ABOUT M.J. HOW IS HE
DOING IN YOUR MATH CLASS?

32:29.148 --> 32:31.380
OH, HE'S SUCH A JOY.

32:31.380 --> 32:33.082
OH, GOD.

32:33.082 --> 32:36.585
YOU JUST DID THE "HE'S SUCH
A JOY" WITH THE HEAD TILT.

32:36.585 --> 32:38.587
I GIVE THAT ONE TO PARENTS
ALL THE TIME

32:38.587 --> 32:43.392
WHEN I THINK THEIR KID
IS DRIFTWOOD.
 NO, SERIOUSLY,
M.J.'s DOING GREAT.

32:43.392 --> 32:46.365
OH, REALLY?
WELL, IF HE'S DOING SO GREAT...

32:46.365 --> 32:48.367
(whispers)
WHY IS HE A GIRAFFE?

32:48.367 --> 32:50.439
WHAT?

32:50.439 --> 32:52.441
(normal voice)
HE SHOULD BE A LEOPARD.

32:52.441 --> 32:55.474
THEY'RE THE ADVANCED STUDENTS.
 YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

32:55.474 --> 32:58.077
I DO NOW.
GABY SOLIS BROKE THE CODE.

32:58.077 --> 32:59.648
WHAT?

32:59.648 --> 33:02.251
THAT'S RIGHT.
GIRAFFES ARE THE SLOW LEARNERS,

33:02.251 --> 33:04.713
AND YOU KNOW IT.
 GIRAFFES ARE THE SLOW LEARNERS?

33:04.713 --> 33:07.086
NO, NO, NO, MRS. CHAPMAN.
NO ONE SAID THAT.

33:07.086 --> 33:10.519
WHY DON'T YOU WAIT FOR ME
IN MY CLASSROOM?

33:10.519 --> 33:12.521
GABRIELLE SOLIS FIGURED OUT
THE CODE--

33:12.521 --> 33:14.523
LEOPARDS, CHIPMUNKS, GIRAFFES.

33:14.523 --> 33:17.226
JENNY, WE GOT THE CODE!

33:17.226 --> 33:19.528
LEOPARDS ARE THE SMART ONES!

33:19.528 --> 33:21.400
NOW LOOK
AT WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

33:21.400 --> 33:24.173
M.J. IS HERE.
HE'S A LEOPARD.

33:24.173 --> 33:26.605
GET USED TO IT.

33:30.039 --> 33:31.340
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

33:31.340 --> 33:34.083
I NEEDED TO CLOSE THE DOOR.

33:34.083 --> 33:37.716
OH, UH, WELL, I THOUGHT A LITTLE
FRESH AIR WOULD BE NICE.

33:37.716 --> 33:41.390
HMM, IT ISN'T.
 WELL, AS THE PERSON
WHO HAS TO SHARE A HOUSE

33:41.390 --> 33:45.354
WITH THE PERSON WHO WON'T TAKE
A BATH, I NEED THE FRESH AIR.

33:45.354 --> 33:48.227
I DON'T CARE. CLOSE IT.

33:48.227 --> 33:51.230
ORSON...

33:51.230 --> 33:54.233
I KNOW THAT YOU ARE ANGRY
AT THE WORLD RIGHT NOW.

33:54.233 --> 33:56.635
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU
IS UNIMAGINABLE,

33:56.635 --> 33:59.638
AND I AM GONNA DO WHATEVER I CAN
TO HELP YOU THROUGH THIS.

33:59.638 --> 34:02.641
AND ALL I ASK IN RETURN IS
THAT YOU TREAT ME

34:02.641 --> 34:04.643
WITH A LITTLE BIT
OF COURTESY,

34:04.643 --> 34:06.645
AND THAT INCLUDES
USING THE WORD "PLEASE."

34:06.645 --> 34:08.647
WHY THE SUDDEN INTEREST
IN ETIQUETTE, BREE?

34:08.647 --> 34:11.120
I MEAN, I DON'T RECALL YOU
SAYING "PLEASE"

34:11.120 --> 34:13.121
BEFORE YOU CHEATED ON ME.

34:13.121 --> 34:16.324
THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER.
THE DOOR STAYS OPEN.

34:16.324 --> 34:19.257
I WANT IT CLOSED.
 NO. YOU STINK.

34:19.257 --> 34:21.560
AND YOU'RE A WHORE!
HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE--

34:21.560 --> 34:24.233
I CAN GET CLEAN.

34:26.264 --> 34:27.795
HMM.

34:27.795 --> 34:31.400
YES, YOU CAN.

34:37.806 --> 34:40.349
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

34:40.349 --> 34:43.752
WHAT IS GOING ON?
I'M NOT EVEN DRESSED.

34:48.556 --> 34:52.291
WHAT IS THAT? WHAT--
WHAT IS THAT? WHAT'S GOING ON?

34:52.291 --> 34:55.364
BREE, STOP.

35:00.629 --> 35:03.572
YOU WOULDN'T.

35:03.572 --> 35:05.404
OKAY, BREE, STOP IT.

35:05.404 --> 35:08.337
STOP. BREE.

35:08.337 --> 35:11.340
IF ONLY THERE WAS A WORD YOU
COULD USE TO GET ME TO STOP,

35:11.340 --> 35:12.881
LIKE "PLEASE."

35:12.881 --> 35:15.244
I'M CALLING JOYCE.
 SAY "PLEASE."

35:15.244 --> 35:17.216
GO TO HELL!

35:17.216 --> 35:19.788
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST SAY IT?
IT'S EASY. PLEASE.

35:19.788 --> 35:21.790
PLEASE. PLEASE.

35:21.790 --> 35:24.793
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.
 PLEASE STOP!

35:24.793 --> 35:27.356
PLEASE, PLEASE!
 PLEASE STOP IT!

35:27.356 --> 35:29.228
PLEASE STOP!

35:29.228 --> 35:31.900
PLEASE ROLL ME OVER.
PLEASE HELP ME OFF THE TOILET.

35:31.900 --> 35:34.533
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE!

35:37.466 --> 35:39.838
THAT'S THE LIFE
I'M FACING NOW,

35:39.838 --> 35:42.441
HAVING TO ASK PEOPLE FOR HELP
FOR EVERYTHING.

35:42.441 --> 35:44.573
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD
THAT IS?!

35:44.573 --> 35:47.346
EVERY MORNING I WAKE UP
AT 5:00.

35:47.346 --> 35:49.348
YOU GET UP AT 6:30.
FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF,

35:49.348 --> 35:51.520
I LIE THERE,
STARING AT THE BEDROOM DOOR,

35:51.520 --> 35:53.752
FANTASIZING ABOUT
HOW LOVELY IT WOULD BE--

35:53.752 --> 35:57.186
HOW EXCRUCIATINGLY LOVELY
IT WOULD BE--

35:57.186 --> 36:02.191
TO GET UP AND MAKE MYSELF
A CUP OF TEA ONE LAST TIME.

36:02.191 --> 36:03.832
NO "PLEASE."

36:03.832 --> 36:07.896
JUST HOT WATER AND TEA.

36:21.250 --> 36:22.651
(water running)

36:22.651 --> 36:26.285
ORSON...

36:26.285 --> 36:28.387
(whispering) I'M SO SORRY.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.222
FORGIVE ME.

36:36.425 --> 36:37.826
(whispers) PLEASE.

36:49.908 --> 36:53.682
(children shouting in distance)

36:53.682 --> 36:56.815
WHAT ARE YOU IN FOR?

36:56.815 --> 36:58.987
EATING PASTE.

36:58.987 --> 37:01.390
WHAT ANIMAL GROUP ARE YOU?

37:01.390 --> 37:02.521
GIRAFFE.

37:02.521 --> 37:05.223
DAMN.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.495
(door opens)

37:06.495 --> 37:08.627
JOEY MURPHY.

37:14.002 --> 37:17.366
I'LL BE WITH YOU TWO
IN A MOMENT.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.572
SORRY FOR GETTING YOU
IN TROUBLE.

37:25.243 --> 37:27.516
IT'S MY OWN FAULT.

37:27.516 --> 37:29.718
I GOT CARRIED AWAY.

37:29.718 --> 37:31.850
ME, TOO.

37:31.850 --> 37:35.484
IT WAS JUST SO IMPORTANT TO ME
THAT JUANITA WAS DOING WELL.

37:35.484 --> 37:36.755
I KNOW.

37:36.755 --> 37:41.630
NO, I DON'T THINK YOU DO.

37:41.630 --> 37:44.493
MY KIDS
ARE MY CALLING CARD.

37:44.493 --> 37:46.795
THEY'RE WHAT I HAVE
TO SHOW FOR MYSELF.

37:46.795 --> 37:50.569
I DON'T HAVE A CAREER, SUSAN.
MY KIDS ARE MY JOB.

37:50.569 --> 37:53.572
AND WHATEVER HAPPENS--IF THEY
SUCCEED OR THEY DON'T SUCCEED--

37:53.572 --> 37:56.605
IT'S BECAUSE
OF HOW I RAISE THEM.

37:56.605 --> 37:58.607
WELL, AT LEAST
YOU GET TO RAISE THEM.

37:58.607 --> 38:01.610
EVER SINCE I TOOK THIS JOB,
I FEEL LIKE I'M NEVER WITH M.J.

38:01.610 --> 38:04.683
I CONSTANTLY WORRY.
AM I THERE ENOUGH FOR HIM?

38:04.683 --> 38:07.616
AM I LETTING HIM DOWN?

38:07.616 --> 38:09.618
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

38:09.618 --> 38:10.959
M.J.'s A FANTASTIC KID.

38:10.959 --> 38:14.423
(chuckles)
WELL, SO IS JUANITA.

38:14.423 --> 38:16.595
(chuckles)

38:16.595 --> 38:19.728
IT'S THEIR MOMS THAT ARE
THE COMPETITIVE NUTS.

38:19.728 --> 38:21.730
(laughs)
THIS HAS BEEN SO RIDICULOUS.

38:21.730 --> 38:23.732
LEOPARDS AND GIRAFFES
AND CHIPMUNKS--

38:23.732 --> 38:26.535
I MEAN, WHO CREATED
THIS CRAZY SYSTEM?

38:26.535 --> 38:28.537
YOU KNOW,
READING CLASS IS JUST AS BAD.

38:28.537 --> 38:31.540
THERE'S OTTERS,
PENGUINS AND SEALS.
 YEAH, JUANITA'S AN OTTER.

38:31.540 --> 38:34.913
I MEAN, WHAT DOES AN OTTER HAVE
TO DO WITH LEARNING HOW TO READ?

38:34.913 --> 38:37.446
(laughs)

38:37.446 --> 38:38.947
JUANITA'S AN OTTER?

38:38.947 --> 38:39.948
YEAH.

38:41.750 --> 38:44.523
WHY? WHAT'S M.J.?
 PENGUIN.

38:58.567 --> 39:00.108
OH.

39:00.108 --> 39:02.541
THIS IS PRETTY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

39:02.541 --> 39:05.043
I THINK MAYBE I'D BUY IT
FOR MY GRANDMA...

39:05.043 --> 39:06.845
IF I HATED HER.

39:08.647 --> 39:10.449
YOU'RE SO FUNNY.

39:10.449 --> 39:13.622
SO... AS MUCH FUN
AS WE'RE HAVING HERE,

39:13.622 --> 39:15.654
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?

39:15.654 --> 39:17.926
WE ARE GETTING TO KNOW
EACH OTHER.

39:17.926 --> 39:19.458
OH.

39:19.458 --> 39:22.360
YOU KNOW ME,
AND YOU DON'T LIKE ME.

39:25.864 --> 39:28.497
IT'S NOT THAT
I DON'T LIKE YOU.

39:28.497 --> 39:30.839
IT'S JUST, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GOOD FOR DANNY.

39:30.839 --> 39:33.572
WHY? BECAUSE I WOULDN'T
EAT YOUR PASTA?

39:33.572 --> 39:36.374
RIGATONI.

39:36.374 --> 39:37.776
AND NO.

39:37.776 --> 39:40.909
IT'S BECAUSE YOU ARE A GOOD-TIME
GIRL OUT TO HAVE FUN.

39:40.909 --> 39:43.882
NOT THAT I BLAME YOU FOR IT.
YOU'RE YOUNG. YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

39:43.882 --> 39:45.884
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE FUN.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.886
BUT DANNY HAS BEEN THROUGH
A LOT,

39:47.886 --> 39:51.389
AND HE NEEDS SOMEONE
WHO IS NOT GONNA HURT HIM.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.792
I KNOW DANNY HAS BEEN
THROUGH ROUGH STUFF.

39:53.792 --> 39:57.566
WHEN HE LASHES OUT
AND GETS ALL DEFENSIVE,

39:57.566 --> 39:59.568
TRYING TO PROTECT HIMSELF?

39:59.568 --> 40:02.501
I GET IT,
BECAUSE I USED TO DO IT, TOO.

40:04.032 --> 40:05.574
YEAH?

40:05.574 --> 40:08.507
IT'S THE THING
THAT MADE ME LIKE HIM.

40:08.507 --> 40:10.739
I KNOW HOW HE FEELS,

40:10.739 --> 40:14.583
AND IT'S NOT FUN AT ALL.

40:16.485 --> 40:18.487
I DON'T CARE IF YOU LIKE ME

40:18.487 --> 40:21.490
AND I DON'T CARE
IF YOU HATE HOW I DRESS,

40:21.490 --> 40:24.422
BUT I AM NOT GONNA
HURT DANNY.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.695
HOW CAN I BE SURE
OF THAT?

40:26.695 --> 40:28.457
YOU CAN'T.

40:28.457 --> 40:30.098
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER,

40:30.098 --> 40:33.962
'CAUSE I'M NOT GOING
ANYWHERE.

40:42.541 --> 40:44.543
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
BACK HERE?

40:44.543 --> 40:47.576
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID LAST TIME.

40:47.576 --> 40:50.579
THE MORE I THOUGHT ABOUT IT,
THE MORE IT PISSED ME OFF.

40:50.579 --> 40:52.551
WHY IS THAT?

40:52.551 --> 40:55.724
THE PEOPLE ON THAT STREET HAVE
BEEN YOUR FRIENDS FOR YEARS.

40:55.724 --> 40:58.086
YOU REALLY THINK
WE WOULD DUMP YOUR ASS

40:58.086 --> 41:01.129
JUST 'CAUSE YOU WENT OFF
THE DEEP END FOR SOME MONTHS?

41:03.231 --> 41:06.565
I APPRECIATE YOU COMING HERE.
I DO.

41:06.565 --> 41:08.567
BUT AFTER EVERYTHING I DID,

41:08.567 --> 41:10.699
I DON'T SEE
HOW ANYONE COULD FORGIVE ME.

41:10.699 --> 41:13.141
(Gabrielle) WELL,
WE'RE NOT SAYING IT'LL BE EASY.

41:15.173 --> 41:18.607
BUT WE'LL GIVE IT A TRY.

41:23.612 --> 41:26.715
(sighs)
 (whispers indistinctly)

41:26.715 --> 41:29.558
I TOLD THEM HOW MUCH BETTER
YOU WERE DOING,

41:29.558 --> 41:31.760
BUT THEY COULDN'T TAKE MY WORD
FOR IT,

41:31.760 --> 41:34.192
SO THEY HAD TO SEE
FOR THEMSELVES.

41:34.192 --> 41:35.664
(chuckles)

41:35.664 --> 41:37.095
OH.

41:59.988 --> 42:01.550
(sighs)

42:03.652 --> 42:05.724
(laughs)

42:13.301 --> 42:16.064
IN OUR DARKEST MOMENTS,

42:16.064 --> 42:19.668
WE ALL NEED
SOMEONE WHO WILL LISTEN.

42:19.668 --> 42:22.911
SOME TURN
TO FRIENDLY PROFESSIONALS.

42:22.911 --> 42:28.216
A FEW RELY ON THOSE
WHO ARE OLDER AND WISER.

42:28.216 --> 42:30.148
OTHERS SEEK OUT

42:30.148 --> 42:34.923
SOMEONE WHO KNOWS
WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH.

42:34.923 --> 42:38.757
BUT FOR MOST OF US,

42:38.757 --> 42:41.930
NOTHING IS QUITE SO THERAPEUTIC

42:41.930 --> 42:44.562
AS A GOOD LONG TALK

42:44.562 --> 42:48.667
WITH A FEW OLD FRIENDS.
