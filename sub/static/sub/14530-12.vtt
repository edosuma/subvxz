00:00.734 --> 00:01.767
<i>My name is avery ryan.</i>

00:01.769 --> 00:03.302
<i>I was a victim of cyber crime.</i>

00:03.304 --> 00:05.771
<i>Like you, I posted</i>
<i>on social media,</i>

00:05.773 --> 00:08.607
<i>Checked my bank account</i>
<i>balance online,</i>

00:08.609 --> 00:10.609
<i>Even kept</i>
<i>the confidential files</i>

00:10.611 --> 00:13.045
<i>Of my psychological practice</i>
<i>on my computer.</i>

00:14.614 --> 00:17.549
<i>Then I was hacked,</i>
<i>and as a result,</i>

00:17.551 --> 00:20.119
<i>One of my patients</i>
<i>was murdered.</i>

00:20.121 --> 00:22.554
My investigation into her death
<i>led me to the fbi,</i>

00:22.556 --> 00:25.357
<i>Where I joined a team</i>
<i>of cyber experts</i>

00:25.359 --> 00:28.260
<i>To wage a war against</i>
<i>a new breed of criminal</i>

00:28.262 --> 00:31.296
<i>Hiding on the deep web...</i>

00:31.298 --> 00:34.366
<i>Infiltrating our daily lives</i>
<i>in ways we never imagined...</i>

00:36.069 --> 00:38.070
<i>...Faceless...</i>

00:38.072 --> 00:40.272
<i>Nameless...</i>

00:40.274 --> 00:42.074
<i>Lurking inside our devices,</i>

00:42.076 --> 00:44.543
<i>Just a keystroke away.</i>

00:47.814 --> 00:50.049
(panting)

01:16.076 --> 01:18.110
Danny...

01:18.112 --> 01:19.845
Ryan:
It's all right. It's...

01:19.847 --> 01:22.147
Come... Come join me
and your brother.

01:43.736 --> 01:44.736
Reporter:
<i>Good evening, detroit.</i>

01:44.738 --> 01:46.205
<i>This is your eye in the sky.</i>

01:46.207 --> 01:47.573
<i>It appears a portion</i>
<i>of the downtown area</i>

01:47.575 --> 01:49.575
Is experiencing a power outage.

01:49.577 --> 01:52.644
Reporter 2:
<i>Traffic in the area is</i>
<i>at an absolute standstill.</i>

01:52.646 --> 01:54.813
Reporter 3:
<i>Police are on the scene</i>
<i>to manage any outbreaks</i>

01:54.815 --> 01:56.115
<i>Of violence or looting.</i>

01:56.117 --> 01:58.117
<i>However, thus far</i>
<i>only a handful</i>

01:58.119 --> 02:00.686
<i>Of minor incidents</i>
<i>have been reported.</i>

02:03.656 --> 02:05.524
I've got
25 blocks

02:05.526 --> 02:06.792
Of downtown detroit in the dark.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.527
Backup systems
are completely unresponsive.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.162
You guys sure this is
a case for the fbi?

02:10.164 --> 02:12.698
We're fbi cyber, this is
exactly our kind of case.

02:12.700 --> 02:15.167
From what we can tell, you're
experiencing a cyber intrusion.

02:15.169 --> 02:17.703
Your power grid's
been hacked.

02:17.705 --> 02:20.506
Reporter:
<i>We just got an update</i>
<i>from detroit river electric,</i>

02:20.508 --> 02:22.174
<i>And they're still working</i>
<i>on the power outage</i>

02:22.176 --> 02:23.408
<i>In the downtown area.</i>

02:54.875 --> 02:57.576
The smart grid allows
for complete control

02:57.578 --> 02:59.378
Of the city's entire power
supply from this room.

02:59.380 --> 03:00.946
Right now,
someone else is in control.

03:00.948 --> 03:03.182
Ramirez:
Scada systems like this
should be impenetrable.

03:03.184 --> 03:04.917
But someone remotely hacked in,

03:04.919 --> 03:06.318
Then locked out
every computer here

03:06.320 --> 03:07.753
By erasing the startup disk.

03:07.755 --> 03:10.756
Recover the disk
and reboot the system

03:10.758 --> 03:12.524
You'll still have
to counter-hack the target

03:12.526 --> 03:13.926
To get the power back on.

03:13.928 --> 03:15.494
Yeah, we're halfway
there already.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.529
Ramirez:
The odd thing
about all this

03:17.531 --> 03:19.765
Is the blackout affects
only 25 blocks.

03:19.767 --> 03:21.400
When I hacked
the new hampshire grid,

03:21.402 --> 03:22.868
I took out the whole state.

03:22.870 --> 03:23.969
Oh, so we bragging now?

03:23.971 --> 03:25.270
Ryan:
No, no.

03:25.272 --> 03:29.975
Why limit this power outage
to such a focused area?

03:29.977 --> 03:31.944
A hacker's objective
is usually

03:31.946 --> 03:33.845
To affect as many
people as possible.

03:33.847 --> 03:36.448
This was a precision attack.

03:36.450 --> 03:38.350
There will be another phase
to this outage.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.953
He's using the scada attack
as camouflage.

03:40.955 --> 03:43.322
The faster we get
those lights on,

03:43.324 --> 03:45.757
What our target's
true intensions are.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.963
The whole state
of new hampshire, huh?

03:50.965 --> 03:52.431
(laughs)

03:52.433 --> 03:54.266
I wanted a three-day weekend.

03:54.268 --> 03:55.534
(chuckles)

03:55.536 --> 03:57.269
Hey, by the way...
Yo.

03:57.271 --> 03:59.738
...Happy two-month
anniversary.

03:59.740 --> 04:00.939
We dating?

04:00.941 --> 04:03.308
No, stupid.

04:03.310 --> 04:04.476
Two months

04:04.478 --> 04:06.278
At the cyber crime division.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.313
You're officially

04:08.315 --> 04:09.281
In the family.

04:09.283 --> 04:10.616
Don't mess up.

04:10.618 --> 04:11.984
I want you to stick around.

04:18.391 --> 04:21.727
Got a live feed to the emergency
operation bureau's incident map.

04:21.729 --> 04:23.028
The blackout is affecting
the central hub of the city,

04:23.030 --> 04:25.364
Both the government and
the financial districts.

04:25.366 --> 04:27.266
Our target could be looking
to hit the federal building,

04:27.268 --> 04:29.501
District court,
city jail,

04:29.503 --> 04:30.836
Baseball stadium,
three banks

04:30.838 --> 04:35.040
Power outage is a great way
to disable security alarms.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.608
There are several incidents
of traffic gridlock.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.511
Whatever our hacker's doing,

04:39.513 --> 04:42.047
So let's focus on the buildings

04:42.049 --> 04:44.583
On the fringe of the blacked out
area of the city.

04:44.585 --> 04:46.018
Locations still in the dark

04:46.020 --> 04:47.986
But where the target won't
get caught in the traffic jam

04:47.988 --> 04:49.988
Caused by the blackout
while trying to flee.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.024
And let's rule out any area
that borders the rail line.

04:52.026 --> 04:54.826
It's a bad idea
to cross the tracks

04:54.828 --> 04:58.363
And risk getting trapped
behind a closed train crossing.

04:58.365 --> 04:59.831
Hey, guys, we're back online!

05:05.305 --> 05:06.371
We're back in control,

05:06.373 --> 05:07.839
But the lights still aren't on.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.508
Yeah, that's gonna
take a minute.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.376
Our hacker's still active
in the system.

05:11.378 --> 05:13.445
Raven's writing a patch
to seal the intrusion.

05:13.447 --> 05:14.746
Wait a minute.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.081
If he's still active
in the system,

05:16.083 --> 05:18.050
That means he needs to maintain
a live connection

05:18.052 --> 05:22.321
Nelson, can you inject malicious
code into raven's patch?

05:22.323 --> 05:25.424
Infiltrate his laptop
before you boot him off.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.758
Tag him so we can track him.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.393
Ryan:
If he uses that computer again,

05:28.395 --> 05:32.564
<i>We may get a location</i>
<i>and possibly his identity.</i>

05:32.566 --> 05:34.333
I want that power on

05:34.335 --> 05:35.467
And that hacker
in handcuffs.

05:35.469 --> 05:36.802
You got it boss, I'm on it.

05:43.810 --> 05:45.877
(lock clunks)

05:58.458 --> 06:00.492
Man:
Yeah, pa,
power's still out.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.427
I'm just gonna
check out the store.

06:27.153 --> 06:28.787
(door clunks)

06:28.789 --> 06:29.788
Man:
Hey!

06:29.790 --> 06:30.989
Who the hell are you?!

06:30.991 --> 06:31.990
(grunts)

06:31.992 --> 06:33.058
(body thuds to floor)

06:36.662 --> 06:38.697
(alarm ringing)

06:48.574 --> 06:51.610
Police responded
to the security alarm,

06:51.612 --> 06:53.678
Found the store owner's son,

06:53.680 --> 06:56.815
Benjamin christos, shot dead.

06:56.817 --> 06:59.050
Single father, two children.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.619
Was he here when
the power went out,

07:00.621 --> 07:02.020
Detective dorn?

07:02.022 --> 07:04.689
We figured he came to
protect the property

07:04.691 --> 07:06.091
Against possible
looters--

07:06.093 --> 07:07.492
Interrupted
the robbery.

07:07.494 --> 07:09.161
It's an auto safe dialer.

07:09.163 --> 07:11.196
It cycles through
every possible combination

07:11.198 --> 07:12.697
Till it lands
on the right one.

07:12.699 --> 07:14.633
All the thief
needed was time.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.101
Explains why
the computer maintained

07:16.103 --> 07:18.170
A live connection
to the power grid.

07:18.172 --> 07:19.171
Had to ensure
that the lights

07:19.173 --> 07:20.172
And the alarm systems

07:20.174 --> 07:21.540
Stayed off.

07:21.542 --> 07:22.674
Looks like
the power outage

07:22.676 --> 07:24.176
Was masking
a jewelry store robbery.

07:24.178 --> 07:27.112
Well, what did they take?

07:27.114 --> 07:29.481
Dorn:
From what we can tell,

07:29.483 --> 07:30.849
The thief left empty-handed.

07:30.851 --> 07:33.785
Most of the jewelry's
on consignment.

07:33.787 --> 07:37.956
That computer...
It was in the vault
when first responders arrived.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.459
Why lock a computer
in a vault?

07:40.461 --> 07:43.094
Well, there's one way
to find out.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.032
Ryan:
Somebody went to
all this trouble--

07:47.034 --> 07:48.567
They even
killed a man--

07:48.569 --> 07:50.101
To leave with
absolutely nothing?

07:50.103 --> 07:51.203
I'm not buying it.

07:51.205 --> 07:52.737
All right.

07:52.739 --> 07:54.072
No modem installed,
no way to connect

07:54.074 --> 07:55.674
To the internet.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.476
There's only
one thing on it.

07:57.478 --> 07:59.511
A bitcoin account
with a zero balance.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.780
This wasn't a jewel heist.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.915
This was a bitcoin heist.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.484
Woman:
<i>Ben came down</i>

08:05.486 --> 08:07.486
To check on the store.

08:07.488 --> 08:09.554
The blackout...

08:09.556 --> 08:10.889
I should've come with him.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.258
But he talked me out of it.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.060
There was a computer
in the vault.

08:15.062 --> 08:16.595
It's the bitcoin computer.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.263
Benjamin's idea.

08:18.265 --> 08:21.132
I really don't understand it.

08:21.134 --> 08:23.235
But he was
so passionate.

08:23.237 --> 08:26.505
He said bitcoin was
the currency of the future.

08:26.507 --> 08:28.607
Ben was taking over
the family business

08:28.609 --> 08:32.844
And I promised I would
trust his judgment.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.080
But now...

08:35.082 --> 08:37.983
My son was killed
over... Over this...

08:37.985 --> 08:39.851
This imaginary currency?

08:39.853 --> 08:41.686
(tabitha sobs)

08:41.688 --> 08:43.688
Do you know
how many bitcoins you had?

08:45.258 --> 08:47.526
Almost half
a million dollars' worth.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.528
Most of our
retirement.

08:49.530 --> 08:52.631
Mundo:
In order to access

08:52.633 --> 08:55.767
The thief would have needed
the passkey to your account.

08:55.769 --> 08:59.638
And it was stored
on the computer in the vault.

08:59.640 --> 09:00.906
Who else knew it was there?

09:05.177 --> 09:06.177
Ellis, no.

09:06.179 --> 09:07.712
He wouldn't.

09:07.714 --> 09:08.980
Stephen.

09:08.982 --> 09:13.251
He was supposed to take
over the business, but...

09:13.253 --> 09:16.154
Ben had so much more ambition.

09:16.156 --> 09:17.722
Drive.

09:17.724 --> 09:21.059
I-I begged them both
to run it together,

09:21.061 --> 09:23.295
But the boys didn't
see eye to eye.

09:23.297 --> 09:24.596
Ryan:
Thank you both.

09:25.298 --> 09:28.633
We'll be in touch.

09:30.803 --> 09:32.203
Bad blood between brothers.

09:32.205 --> 09:33.972
Half a million dollars
at stake.

09:33.974 --> 09:35.974
And stephen would have known
that taking the bitcoin

09:35.976 --> 09:37.909
Over of the jewelry
was hassle-free.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.978
Transfer it from one
account to another,

09:39.980 --> 09:41.646
It's... Well,
almost untraceable.

09:41.648 --> 09:42.681
No serial numbers.

09:42.683 --> 09:43.682
Nothing to fence.

09:43.684 --> 09:44.950
Sounds like we
have to have

09:44.952 --> 09:47.118
A little chat with
stephen christos.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.954
When the power came back on,

09:48.956 --> 09:51.156
So did the jewelry store's
security camera.

09:58.230 --> 09:59.297
Is this stephen?

09:59.299 --> 10:01.600
No.

10:01.602 --> 10:04.135
I have never seen that man
before in my life.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.704
Is this the man
who murdered our son?

10:05.706 --> 10:08.807
Took our grandchildren's
father from them?

10:08.809 --> 10:10.342
Now we have a face.

10:10.344 --> 10:12.911
We just need a name.

10:21.120 --> 10:24.389
So, no luck identifying
our bitcoin thief, huh?

10:24.391 --> 10:25.724
No, sir.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.125
Ran the facial recognition.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.360
Big dead end.

10:28.362 --> 10:30.061
Guy's not in the fbi database.

10:30.063 --> 10:32.897
But the bitcoins have
provided an interesting lead.

10:32.899 --> 10:36.735
The biggest misconception
about bitcoins

10:36.737 --> 10:37.802
Is that it's anonymous.

10:37.804 --> 10:38.970
I mean, that's why it's

10:38.972 --> 10:40.372
The preferred currency
of the deep web.

10:40.374 --> 10:43.375
It's used to fund
drug deals, hit men,

10:43.377 --> 10:46.645
Human trafficking, but it's
not actually that anonymous.

10:46.647 --> 10:47.979
Is this a bitcoin lecture

10:47.981 --> 10:49.314
Or did you make
an actually discovery here?

10:49.316 --> 10:51.049
Oh, right. Sorry.

10:51.051 --> 10:53.351
I accessed the block chain,

10:53.353 --> 10:56.187
Which is a public ledger that
records every bitcoin spent.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.656
Every cent's accounted for--
where it came from

10:57.658 --> 10:58.990
And where it went.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.659
And each transaction is listed

11:00.661 --> 11:02.293
As a long sequence
of randomized numbers.

11:02.295 --> 11:03.328
Ah.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.130
So you can't tie
it to a person,

11:05.132 --> 11:07.232
But you can tie it
to an account, right?

11:07.234 --> 11:09.267
So, it's like
a stock market transaction.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.268
I mean, you can see
somebody bought

11:10.270 --> 11:11.703
200 shares
of a commodity.

11:11.705 --> 11:12.937
You just don't know who.

11:12.939 --> 11:14.406
Exactly!

11:14.408 --> 11:15.907
But if you know the amount
that you're looking for,

11:15.909 --> 11:17.742
You can find any
bitcoin transaction

11:17.744 --> 11:19.244
That's ever been made.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.712
Even when it's stolen,

11:20.714 --> 11:22.447
There is a record of
the bitcoin movement.

11:22.449 --> 11:23.882
All you need is the amount,

11:23.884 --> 11:27.152
Date and time.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.753
So, this is last
night's robbery.

11:28.755 --> 11:29.854
What we're looking at

11:29.856 --> 11:31.289
Is our thief's bitcoin account.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.024
1,208 bitcoins.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.860
As of today, worth just shy

11:35.862 --> 11:37.729
Of 500,000 u.S. Dollars.

11:37.731 --> 11:38.897
Now, of course,
the bitcoin market

11:38.899 --> 11:41.266
Fluctuates so dramatically

11:41.268 --> 11:42.801
That this many bitcoins
could very be easily be worth

11:42.803 --> 11:45.270
Over a million dollars
in the very near future.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.305
Explains why someone went
to such lengths to steal it.

11:47.307 --> 11:48.940
Mm-hmm.

11:48.942 --> 11:52.744
So, what digital dust can we
follow here to catch our thief?

11:52.746 --> 11:53.878
Well, every bitcoin account
is protected

11:53.880 --> 11:56.381
By a 64-character passkey.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.718
<i>And if you have the passkey,</i>
<i>you can unlock the account.</i>

11:59.720 --> 12:01.319
And whoever has the
passkey to this account

12:01.321 --> 12:03.388
Is probably our killer.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.094
Well, that's odd.

12:09.096 --> 12:12.764
Our thief's bitcoin account is
protected by two passkeys.

12:12.766 --> 12:14.265
Typically, it's just the one.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.067
Yeah, it's like
a safe deposit box.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.470
It requires two
keys to open it.

12:18.472 --> 12:20.805
Which might just imply

12:20.807 --> 12:24.809
Our bitcoin thief has
an accomplice.

12:24.811 --> 12:26.077
Hey, guys!

12:26.079 --> 12:28.046
The malicious track worked.

12:28.048 --> 12:30.348
I pinpointed the exact location
of the bitcoin thief's computer.

12:30.350 --> 12:31.816
This is agent elijah mundo.

12:31.818 --> 12:35.353
I need a swat team
at 5280 clinton place.

12:35.355 --> 12:38.022
(tires screech)

13:08.053 --> 13:10.455
Man: Clear!
Mundo: Well, there's our thief.

13:10.457 --> 13:13.158
(alarm ringing)
ryan:
<i>Looks like we're not</i>

13:13.160 --> 13:15.293
The only ones interested
in stolen bitcoins.

13:20.499 --> 13:26.905
â™ª I know you've deceived me,
now here's a surprise â™ª

13:28.574 --> 13:34.345
â™ª I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes â™ª

13:34.347 --> 13:38.516
â™ª I can see
for miles and miles â™ª

13:38.518 --> 13:41.853
â™ª I can see for miles
and miles â™ª

13:41.855 --> 13:46.424
â™ª I can see
for miles and miles â™ª

13:46.426 --> 13:49.894
â™ª and miles...

13:49.896 --> 13:52.263
â™ª oh, yeah.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.382
All right. Thanks, bud.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.518
All right.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.086
Krumitz ran the name we got
off the victim's I.D.

14:15.088 --> 14:18.456
We are looking at the infamous
brian kramer.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.325
Apparently he made
a living robbing

14:20.327 --> 14:22.060
Large bitcoin accounts he
found on the block chain.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.194
This was his fifth.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.562
Tracked charitable contributions

14:24.564 --> 14:27.966
From bitcoin accounts
to find his targets.

14:27.968 --> 14:28.900
Laceration

14:28.902 --> 14:30.435
Of the throat looks like cod.

14:30.437 --> 14:31.903
He bled out, but over here,

14:31.905 --> 14:34.572
It looks like our
victim was sliced open.

14:34.574 --> 14:35.940
And patched up multiple times.

14:35.942 --> 14:39.477
He was tortured.

14:39.479 --> 14:42.046
Closed the wounds
with super glue.

14:42.048 --> 14:46.918
It's commonly used by people
with military training.

14:46.920 --> 14:49.954
Keep him live
long enough to talk.

14:49.956 --> 14:52.357
Detroit pd is still trying
to locate stephen christos.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.325
Hasn't answered calls
from his family.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.327
We can't wait this out.
Track his cell phone.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.595
Get a gps location on him.

14:57.597 --> 14:58.930
Okay, got it.

14:58.932 --> 15:00.498
Hard drive's been removed.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.900
Whoever did that to him was

15:01.902 --> 15:03.568
Definitely after
the stolen bitcoins.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.037
If they had the hard drive,
why torture him?

15:06.039 --> 15:08.306
'cause the passkey wasn't
on the hard drive.

15:10.676 --> 15:13.177
Door was barricaded
by the dresser.

15:13.179 --> 15:15.013
Bought our victim a little time.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.314
Long enough for our thief

15:16.316 --> 15:18.483
To take the passkey
out of the computer.

15:18.485 --> 15:20.251
Bad guy breaks through the door.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.921
Tries to access
the bitcoin account, he can't.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.088
Tortures the thief

15:24.090 --> 15:25.957
For the passkey.
Sounds good.

15:25.959 --> 15:27.292
Unfortunately,
it's all speculation.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.193
The answers died
with his laptop.

15:29.195 --> 15:32.030
Not necessarily.

15:32.032 --> 15:34.499
Took the hard drive,
but not the ram chip.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.100
Still might be a way
to get some answers.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.969
Ram keeps track of the programs

15:37.971 --> 15:39.070
Your computer's running
while it's on.

15:39.072 --> 15:42.073
The moment the computer
loses power...

15:42.075 --> 15:43.474
<i>The ram starts to forget.</i>

15:43.476 --> 15:45.143
<i>Information decays.</i>

15:45.145 --> 15:46.644
<i>Freezing it...</i>

15:47.379 --> 15:49.080
...Stops the process.

15:49.082 --> 15:50.381
(laughs)

15:50.383 --> 15:52.150
Mundo:
<i>Most people don't go to a bar</i>

15:52.152 --> 15:55.720
Their brother's been murdered
and their family robbed.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.689
I needed a drink, okay?

15:57.691 --> 15:59.691
I would imagine so.

15:59.693 --> 16:01.559
What are you implying?

16:03.629 --> 16:05.330
Why don't you tell us
about these e-mails, stephen?

16:05.332 --> 16:08.166
We accessed your phone.

16:08.168 --> 16:11.169
You got a call at 6:17
from your mother.

16:11.171 --> 16:13.638
And that your brother
had been murdered.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.540
Even though

16:15.542 --> 16:17.108
Your brother was dead,
all you cared about

16:17.110 --> 16:19.043
Was the money.

16:19.045 --> 16:20.278
Mundo:
'cause the next thing you did

16:20.280 --> 16:21.446
Was check the balance

16:21.448 --> 16:23.348
Of the store's bitcoin account.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.350
You found it at zero.

16:25.352 --> 16:28.653
I knew those damn bitcoins
were a bad idea.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.488
Unregulated,

16:30.490 --> 16:32.256
Uninsurable, I...

16:32.258 --> 16:34.058
Tried to warn my parents

16:34.060 --> 16:35.693
And my brother--
I said bitcoins

16:35.695 --> 16:38.062
Are too risky.

16:38.064 --> 16:39.197
If they get stolen,
they're gone.

16:39.199 --> 16:40.498
You can't get them back.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.101
But you tried to get them back.

16:43.103 --> 16:45.636
Four hours ago...
You contacted

16:45.638 --> 16:47.271
Bounty hunters by e-mail

16:47.273 --> 16:50.341
And negotiated a price to
recover the stolen bitcoins.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.443
Did you really think bitcoin
bounty hunters were the answer

16:52.445 --> 16:53.678
To all your problems?

16:53.680 --> 16:55.146
You'll get the money back,

16:55.148 --> 16:57.515
Then... You can take over.

16:57.517 --> 17:01.252
My parents had just lost a son!

17:01.254 --> 17:02.687
And now they were staring
at poverty.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.122
Did they tell you
they used their retirement

17:04.124 --> 17:06.190
To keep the business afloat?

17:06.192 --> 17:08.760
That my brother's bright idea
was to convert

17:08.762 --> 17:10.395
To bitcoin?! No.

17:10.397 --> 17:13.431
I'd imagine they didn't.

17:13.433 --> 17:16.467
After all the years
of hard work,

17:16.469 --> 17:19.070
All they gave up,

17:19.072 --> 17:21.105
The only thing
I could think to do

17:21.107 --> 17:23.041
Was get the money back.

17:23.043 --> 17:24.375
For them.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.077
Not me.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.412
Look at that.

17:27.414 --> 17:28.813
You see that?

17:28.815 --> 17:31.816
That's the work
of the men you hired.

17:31.818 --> 17:35.053
Do they look like the kind
of men who give back money?

17:35.055 --> 17:37.755
We need information.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.557
All I have is a web site.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.092
And I had an e-mail address.

17:41.094 --> 17:42.527
That's it.

17:42.529 --> 17:45.129
They said they would contact me.

17:45.131 --> 17:47.131
These are incredibly
dangerous men, stephen.

17:47.133 --> 17:48.766
They lurk in the deep web.

17:48.768 --> 17:51.235
In a world you can't even
begin to imagine.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.438
They've already killed one man.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.607
You have started something
you can't undo.

17:59.211 --> 18:00.845
Krumitz:
<i>Bounty hunters' web site</i>
<i>and e-mail address</i>

18:00.847 --> 18:02.413
<i>Are a wild goose chase.</i>

18:02.415 --> 18:03.548
Well, that's no surprise.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.083
These bounty hunters specialize

18:05.085 --> 18:06.184
In bitcoin retrieval.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.852
They think of themselves
as elites.

18:07.854 --> 18:10.254
They're skilled,
educated, tech-savvy.

18:10.256 --> 18:12.824
So we can't bet on them
making any mistakes.

18:12.826 --> 18:14.325
It gets worse.
Our bitcoin thief

18:14.327 --> 18:16.327
Was no bozo, either.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.463
We got the results
from the degraded images

18:18.465 --> 18:20.731
<i>We recovered from</i>
<i>the thief's computer ram.</i>

18:20.733 --> 18:22.567
This is

18:22.569 --> 18:24.335
A botnet-- a massive group

18:24.337 --> 18:26.671
Of maliciously infected
personal computers--

18:26.673 --> 18:29.674
Or bots-- from all around the
country harnessed together.

18:29.676 --> 18:32.743
Basically, it's a network
of computers used for evil.

18:32.745 --> 18:34.846
<i>But the people who own</i>
<i>the computers have no idea</i>

18:34.848 --> 18:36.414
<i>That they're part</i>
<i>of an evil empire.</i>

18:36.416 --> 18:38.749
After the computers
are infected, the hacker

18:38.751 --> 18:41.152
Has full control over every
single computer on the network.

18:41.154 --> 18:42.353
That's roughly...

18:42.355 --> 18:43.588
20,000?

18:43.590 --> 18:46.157
Unsavory characters,
like our dead thief,

18:46.159 --> 18:49.227
Rent out their botnets
to send spam e-mails,

18:49.229 --> 18:52.363
Perform ddos attacks,
mass identity theft.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.132
You know, all that
good illegal stuff.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.566
Ryan:
Can you tell if our thief

18:55.568 --> 18:57.368
Connected to the botnet
before the bounty hunters

18:57.370 --> 18:59.837
Broke down that motel room door?

18:59.839 --> 19:01.272
What?

19:01.274 --> 19:02.540
What?

19:02.542 --> 19:04.208
What is it, krumitz?

19:04.210 --> 19:06.344
He sent two separate messages
to two separate computers

19:06.346 --> 19:08.246
Somewhere in the botnet.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.514
Ryan:
It must've been the passkeys.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.182
Like a bank robber hiding
his stash until the heat

19:11.184 --> 19:13.417
Dies down and he can
recover it and get away.

19:13.419 --> 19:16.187
Are you saying two random
computers-- two in 20,000--

19:16.189 --> 19:18.723
Are secretly storing
the passkeys.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.224
And the owners don't know it.

19:20.226 --> 19:21.292
That's not the bad part.

19:21.294 --> 19:22.793
The ram got us to the botnet.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.295
But it was far
too degraded to tell me

19:24.297 --> 19:25.696
Which of these
two people have them.

19:25.698 --> 19:28.232
But the bounty hunters have
the thief's hard drive.

19:28.234 --> 19:29.600
And that means

19:29.602 --> 19:31.869
They know which two people
have the passkeys.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.771
They have the digital
treasure map.

19:33.773 --> 19:36.941
So, two innocent people have
no idea what's coming to them.

19:36.943 --> 19:39.210
<i>And we have no way</i>
<i>of warning them.</i>

20:05.404 --> 20:06.704
Hey, what are you doing
in my house?!

20:07.539 --> 20:09.340
(grunting)

20:15.781 --> 20:16.581
Hey!

20:16.583 --> 20:17.782
(groans)

20:21.420 --> 20:22.954
You get what we came for?

20:22.956 --> 20:24.922
Yeah, I got the passkey.

20:24.924 --> 20:27.992
One more passkey and
we're a half mil richer.

20:38.904 --> 20:39.904
(phone rings)

20:39.906 --> 20:42.273
Hold on, krummy,
let me transfer you to ctoc.

20:42.275 --> 20:43.608
Man:
This came for you, nelson.

20:43.610 --> 20:44.842
What's this?

20:44.844 --> 20:46.944
Don't know.
A judge won't typically hand out

20:46.946 --> 20:48.613
A warrant on the evidence
we have.

20:48.615 --> 20:52.383
But I pleaded my case and
got us into the server farm

20:52.385 --> 20:54.719
Housing the botnet's
command and control server.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.320
I got krumitz on the big screen.

20:56.322 --> 20:57.822
So, tell me we have names.

20:57.824 --> 21:00.024
Performing
a live acquisition now.

21:00.026 --> 21:02.460
We are seconds away from having
the same information

21:02.462 --> 21:04.262
The bounty hunters do.

21:04.264 --> 21:05.663
The server has a record
of every interaction

21:05.665 --> 21:06.764
The thieves made
with the botnet.

21:06.766 --> 21:10.368
Our targets before they get
those passkeys,

21:10.370 --> 21:11.936
The christos' savings
will be gone forever.

21:11.938 --> 21:13.638
Every cent they have.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.806
Every minute counts, and
we're behind already.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.942
Something's wrong here.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.910
Uh, hold on.

21:19.912 --> 21:21.545
What is it, daniel?

21:21.547 --> 21:23.648
(groans)

21:25.550 --> 21:26.851
Nelson:
He's been disconnected.

21:26.853 --> 21:29.453
I need a win off
that server, krumitz.

21:29.455 --> 21:30.955
The drive's
completely corrupted.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.791
From the look of it,
someone did this deliberately.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.793
The bounty hunters are covering
their tracks. Damn it.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.795
Deleted is recoverable,
but the drive

21:37.797 --> 21:39.764
Is being overwritten;
everything is gone.

21:39.766 --> 21:40.965
Ramirez:
I've been monitoring

21:40.967 --> 21:42.033
Stephen christos'
e-mail activity.

21:42.035 --> 21:43.701
Bounty hunters

21:43.703 --> 21:44.869
Just sent a new message.

21:44.871 --> 21:46.504
Due to unforeseen complications,

21:46.506 --> 21:48.806
They're upping their price.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.374
Unforeseen complications.

21:50.376 --> 21:51.842
That what they're calling murder
these days?

21:51.844 --> 21:52.977
Ramirez:
They made a mistake.

21:52.979 --> 21:55.613
The computer they sent
this e-mail from

21:55.615 --> 21:57.715
Had a parental control program
designed to go unnoticed.

21:57.717 --> 22:00.851
Bounty hunters would have no way
of knowing it was there.

22:00.853 --> 22:02.453
Parental controls are installed

22:02.455 --> 22:03.988
<i>So parents can monitor</i>
<i>their children on the internet.</i>

22:03.990 --> 22:06.057
<i>It tags everything coming in</i>
<i>and going out.</i>

22:09.394 --> 22:10.528
Simon, if there's
parental controls,

22:10.530 --> 22:11.796
It means there's children there.

22:11.798 --> 22:12.963
Yeah, I hear you.

22:12.965 --> 22:15.800
Yes! Parental controls
came through.

22:15.802 --> 22:17.835
Just got a physical address
on the bounty hunters.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.537
Okay, I'll notify
the local authorities

22:19.539 --> 22:21.439
To move on the location
cautiously.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.441
Meanwhile,
let's get you on a plane.

22:29.715 --> 22:32.883
(indistinct radio transmission)

22:32.885 --> 22:34.952
Man:
Normally I don't get home
from work this early.

22:34.954 --> 22:37.021
I'm just glad
my son wasn't home.

22:39.791 --> 22:41.992
Edward gaines, found in
a bathtub bound and gagged.

22:41.994 --> 22:43.094
He suffered a laceration

22:43.096 --> 22:44.595
And a concussion.

22:44.597 --> 22:45.930
If the blow to the head
hadn't knocked him out,

22:45.932 --> 22:47.631
A bullet would've been next.

22:47.633 --> 22:49.467
Raven's pulling
traffic cam footage

22:49.469 --> 22:51.736
Looking for faces based
on edward's description.

22:51.738 --> 22:53.003
Did our targets get
what they came for?

22:53.005 --> 22:54.071
Yep.

22:54.073 --> 22:55.539
The e-mail that
stephen christos got

22:55.541 --> 22:57.475
Was sent from this computer.

22:57.477 --> 22:59.744
The bounty hunters now have
the first passkey.

22:59.746 --> 23:02.046
Well, they're halfway
to their goal,

23:02.048 --> 23:04.148
And we're stuck at
the starting line.

23:04.150 --> 23:07.051
(sighs)
so what's our play?

23:07.053 --> 23:10.521
Do you remember how I fought
so hard to bring in tobin?

23:10.523 --> 23:13.491
Yeah, the cyber division needed
someone who could work the cases

23:13.493 --> 23:16.494
Like a hacker, work the
cases from the inside.

23:16.496 --> 23:17.995
We're gonna use
that same tactic.

23:17.997 --> 23:20.731
We're gonna work this case
from the inside.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.047
(chuckles)

23:37.049 --> 23:39.116
Mom and pop.

23:53.565 --> 23:55.065
The mystery box?

23:55.067 --> 23:57.968
Yeah, uh, (chuckles)

23:57.970 --> 24:00.037
They gave me
all my devices back.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.572
From your arrest?
Yep.

24:01.574 --> 24:03.808
Look at you, probie no more.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.075
(chuckles)

24:05.077 --> 24:07.812
God, it took me six months
to get off my probation.

24:07.814 --> 24:09.046
Hmm.

24:09.048 --> 24:10.648
Who do you know?
Yeah, you know...

24:10.650 --> 24:12.082
We need to get
inside that botnet.

24:12.084 --> 24:14.018
Avery, the system is fried.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.586
Yes, but the botnet
still exists.

24:15.588 --> 24:17.087
So you're thinking

24:17.089 --> 24:18.789
We should join the botnet?

24:18.791 --> 24:21.091
Ramirez: Well, we can take
the botnet's malicious code

24:21.093 --> 24:22.193
Off mr. Gaines' laptop

24:22.195 --> 24:24.094
And infect one of ours
and we're in.

24:24.096 --> 24:25.496
Then we'll know

24:25.498 --> 24:26.730
What the bounty hunters know,

24:26.732 --> 24:28.032
And we'll have a chance
to get one step ahead.

24:28.034 --> 24:30.034
First time I ever wanted
a computer virus.

24:30.036 --> 24:31.101
Ramirez:
I know what you mean.

24:31.903 --> 24:33.771
Krumitz:
Let's see what we got.

24:36.175 --> 24:39.477
Okay, now that you're connected
to the botnet,

24:39.479 --> 24:41.946
You should be able to break in
and send it commands.

24:43.748 --> 24:44.882
(chuckles) what?

24:44.884 --> 24:46.150
You don't think I pay attention

24:46.152 --> 24:47.818
When you guys geek out
with code speak?

24:47.820 --> 24:50.721
All right, avery.
Ping this entire network.

24:50.723 --> 24:53.557
We are looking
for the two computers

24:53.559 --> 24:55.926
That have those passkeys.

24:57.996 --> 25:00.130
Krumitz:
Okay, the d.C. I.P. Address

25:00.132 --> 25:02.766
Is mr. Gaines' laptop
right here on this desk.

25:02.768 --> 25:04.902
The bounty hunters already took
the passkey off that one,

25:04.904 --> 25:07.004
But the other one...
Ramirez:
Albuquerque, new mexico.

25:07.006 --> 25:08.138
Mm-hmm.
Hey.

25:08.140 --> 25:10.274
All right.
Whoa, too slow.

25:10.276 --> 25:11.675
Krumitz:
Yeah.

25:11.677 --> 25:12.810
(laughter)

25:12.812 --> 25:14.678
Hang on.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.213
Nelson, this is a win;
this is when we celebrate

25:16.215 --> 25:19.683
No, no, check out
that I.P. Address.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.952
It's not static; it's dynamic.

25:21.954 --> 25:24.522
Every time a computer
with a dynamic I.P. Turns on,

25:24.524 --> 25:26.123
It gets assigned

25:26.125 --> 25:27.291
A new I.P. Address randomly

25:27.293 --> 25:29.226
From its
internet service provider,

25:29.228 --> 25:31.195
But when it turns off,
the I.P. Address

25:31.197 --> 25:33.197
Will be randomly reassigned
to a different device.

25:33.199 --> 25:36.634
The I.P. Address they recovered
from that hard drive.

25:36.636 --> 25:38.168
There you go.

25:38.170 --> 25:39.737
The second passkey's
in albuquerque,

25:39.739 --> 25:41.205
But the bounty hunters
don't know that.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.274
They're going
to the wrong location.

25:43.276 --> 25:45.042
Okay, I'll contact
the service provider,

25:45.044 --> 25:47.211
Figure out the I.P. Address
our bounty hunters are chasing,

25:47.213 --> 25:48.546
Find out where they're headed.

25:48.548 --> 25:49.747
Work quickly.

25:49.749 --> 25:51.682
They retrieved
that first passkey.

25:51.684 --> 25:55.085
If they come up empty at
this next location,

25:55.087 --> 25:56.186
Who knows what they'll do.

26:02.794 --> 26:04.762
Krumitz has plotted
the bounty hunters'

26:04.764 --> 26:06.063
Final destination.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.765
Denver, colorado.

26:07.767 --> 26:10.067
So there's gonna be a
plane waiting for you

26:10.069 --> 26:11.669
And your team on the tarmac.

26:11.671 --> 26:13.904
Hey, just got back the results
on the footage

26:13.906 --> 26:17.975
<i>And I have security footage</i>
<i>from around the motel</i>

26:17.977 --> 26:20.644
<i>In detroit where we found</i>
<i>our bitcoin thief.</i>

26:20.646 --> 26:22.713
Cross-referenced
every face we found,

26:22.715 --> 26:24.782
Looking for anyone in both
cities in the past 24 hours.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.917
I.D.'d two men
traveling together.

26:26.919 --> 26:30.354
Jeremy and henry spitz,
brothers, ex-military,

26:30.356 --> 26:33.057
Both dishonorably
discharged, a long history

26:33.059 --> 26:34.925
Of violent behavior
resulting in arrests.

26:34.927 --> 26:37.695
They fit the profile
of our bounty hunters.

26:37.697 --> 26:40.698
We need to expect unpredictable
explosive behavior.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.299
All right.
Put out a bolo on the pair

26:42.301 --> 26:43.867
And inform the tsa.
If they're grounded,

26:43.869 --> 26:45.369
They're gonna be forced
to drive to denver.

26:45.371 --> 26:46.704
That's gonna buy us some time.

26:46.706 --> 26:48.672
I'll take raven to albuquerque,

26:48.674 --> 26:51.609
And you're gonna need to find
that final bitcoin passkey.

26:51.611 --> 26:53.911
Let's set this trap.

27:08.293 --> 27:11.729
Hello, I'm special agent
avery ryan.

27:11.731 --> 27:12.763
I'm running this operation.

27:12.765 --> 27:13.931
Is everybody out of the house?

27:13.933 --> 27:15.299
Yes, our son's staying

27:15.301 --> 27:17.101
The night at a friend's.

27:17.103 --> 27:19.303
Hopefully this will
all be over by morning.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.672
Nelson:
<i>This comes to an end here!</i>

27:21.674 --> 27:22.706
(grunting)

27:22.708 --> 27:24.008
This is our appomattox.

27:24.010 --> 27:26.310
Appomattox, really?

27:26.312 --> 27:27.778
You're really gonna
compare this

27:27.780 --> 27:29.780
To the battle that ended
the civil war?

27:29.782 --> 27:32.349
(grunting)
yeah, why not?

27:32.351 --> 27:35.786
You have any idea how many men
died in that battle?

27:35.788 --> 27:37.855
Appomattox.
Step up your game, man.

27:45.864 --> 27:47.831
A dynamic what?
It's your I.P. Address.

27:47.833 --> 27:50.768
I don't see why I have
to leave my home.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.703
Again, ma'am, this is an
ongoing investigation.

27:52.705 --> 27:54.805
I have told you
as much as I can.

27:54.807 --> 27:56.874
Now I would like to move you
into protective custody

27:56.876 --> 27:58.075
Till we resolve all this.

27:58.077 --> 27:59.810
What's she doing
on my computer anyway?

27:59.812 --> 28:01.812
Removing something
worth killing for.

28:01.814 --> 28:03.247
Got the passkey.

28:03.249 --> 28:04.915
Sending it to the boys now.

28:10.355 --> 28:12.856
Well, that smile must mean
we're on schedule.

28:12.858 --> 28:14.725
Just got the final passkey
from raven.

28:14.727 --> 28:15.859
Krumitz is finishing up inside.

28:15.861 --> 28:17.895
We're good to go.

28:17.897 --> 28:21.131
I know we're right in the middle
of something, but, uh,

28:21.133 --> 28:23.333
I just wanted to say thanks

28:23.335 --> 28:24.968
For getting me off probation.

28:24.970 --> 28:27.137
And giving me
all my devices back.

28:27.139 --> 28:29.106
They mean a lot to me.

28:29.108 --> 28:31.208
Got my tablet back today.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.110
You know, I had all
my photos in there

28:33.112 --> 28:35.312
And my family stuff.

28:35.314 --> 28:38.382
It was good to see
my parents again.

28:38.384 --> 28:40.984
I haven't seen them
since the trial.

28:40.986 --> 28:42.986
It's complicated.

28:44.089 --> 28:45.489
Well, sifter and I spoke
to the judge.

28:45.491 --> 28:46.824
She agreed to lift
your probation.

28:46.826 --> 28:48.726
Wow, that's-that's crazy.

28:48.728 --> 28:50.127
I didn't,
I didn't even know he liked me.

28:50.129 --> 28:51.795
(chuckling):
No, he-he doesn't.

28:53.932 --> 28:55.766
We all set?

28:55.768 --> 28:57.801
Oh, yeah. We embedded
a decoy passkey

28:57.803 --> 28:59.336
On the computer in the home,

28:59.338 --> 29:01.071
One infected
with our own malicious code.

29:01.073 --> 29:03.207
<i>So when the bounty hunters try</i>
<i>to use that passkey,</i>

29:03.209 --> 29:04.475
It'll infect their computer

29:04.477 --> 29:05.776
And we'll have complete
control over it.

29:05.778 --> 29:07.144
Well, they're reckless
and greedy.

29:07.146 --> 29:08.479
They'll want
immediate gratification.

29:08.481 --> 29:09.847
We won't have to wait long.

29:09.849 --> 29:11.115
All right, but when
they plug in,

29:11.117 --> 29:12.750
We'll be able to steal
the first passkey back.

29:12.752 --> 29:15.986
We have to prove
it was on their computer.

29:15.988 --> 29:18.922
That passkey is the only thing
that links those men

29:18.924 --> 29:20.157
To the murder
and the home invasion.

29:20.159 --> 29:24.828
Don't worry. We'll be screen-
capturing the entire session.

29:26.999 --> 29:30.067
We lost the connection to
the schaeffers' computer.

29:30.069 --> 29:32.202
He'll get it back online.

29:32.204 --> 29:34.238
(groans)

29:43.982 --> 29:45.482
Krumitz, what the hell
are you doing?

29:45.484 --> 29:48.786
We're having technical issues.
Avery, we just got word.

29:48.788 --> 29:50.254
Swat's reporting
a suspicious looking suv

29:50.256 --> 29:52.022
That just entered
the neighborhood.

29:52.024 --> 29:53.323
How long?

29:53.325 --> 29:55.492
Bring up
the home security cameras.

29:55.494 --> 29:56.960
I need eyes on the perimeter.

29:58.830 --> 30:00.898
We got it.

30:04.402 --> 30:06.003
(groans)

30:06.005 --> 30:07.971
Nelson:
We got a problem, elijah.

30:21.052 --> 30:23.987
Danny, it's okay.

30:23.989 --> 30:27.157
Just come stand by me
and your brother.

30:37.535 --> 30:39.436
We'll do
anything you ask.

30:39.438 --> 30:41.972
Please, just don't...

30:41.974 --> 30:44.041
Don't hurt my family.

30:52.383 --> 30:55.886
Just take what you want.

30:55.888 --> 30:58.188
No one's stopping you;
we're the only ones here.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.389
Check the back,
make sure we're alone.

31:09.201 --> 31:13.503
(whispering): He came for a
video game for his sleepover.

31:13.505 --> 31:15.038
Where's my mom and dad?

31:15.040 --> 31:16.506
It's okay, jeffrey.

31:16.508 --> 31:18.575
Just do what
I tell you.

31:21.145 --> 31:22.946
Jeremy:
All clear.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.383
You.
Me?

31:26.385 --> 31:29.086
You got a computer in here
somewhere-- take me to it.

31:29.088 --> 31:30.921
Danny, do what the
man tells you to do.

31:30.923 --> 31:32.256
Listen to your mother.

31:32.258 --> 31:33.657
She'll get you
out of this alive.

31:34.626 --> 31:36.093
It's, uh,
it's upstairs.

31:36.095 --> 31:37.494
Move.

31:47.438 --> 31:49.439
Have your men hold.

31:49.441 --> 31:51.909
I got two fbi agents
and an innocent in there.

31:51.911 --> 31:53.577
We storm the house at the wrong
time, somebody will get killed.

31:53.579 --> 31:55.178
How the hell did
that kid get in there?

31:55.180 --> 31:56.947
Avery just spotted him
coming in the back door

31:56.949 --> 31:58.348
<i>Through the security camera.</i>

32:00.151 --> 32:01.985
I need more men in the back--
there's a hole in that fence.

32:01.987 --> 32:03.186
Fill it now.

32:03.188 --> 32:04.521
How we doing on your end?

32:04.523 --> 32:06.056
Trap's set--
those guys take the bait,

32:06.058 --> 32:07.925
We'll have them dead to rights.

32:07.927 --> 32:09.927
Jail for life, and some.

32:09.929 --> 32:11.929
Um, we've got a volatile
situation in there, nelson.

32:11.931 --> 32:13.063
We can't wait long.

32:14.198 --> 32:16.400
Henry:
Sit.

32:16.402 --> 32:19.002
Okay, you got it, but do
you mind lowering your gun?

32:21.306 --> 32:23.373
Open the
system's folder.

32:24.609 --> 32:27.577
Just give me a minute--
I-I'm not good with computers.

32:27.579 --> 32:29.112
Uh, here, here?

32:29.114 --> 32:30.247
Open it.

32:34.519 --> 32:36.420
Now utilities.

32:37.722 --> 32:39.122
Here?

32:42.060 --> 32:43.961
You see two, you moron?

32:43.963 --> 32:46.229
Nelson: This is not good, man,
we're in trouble.

32:46.231 --> 32:48.031
Look, this guy's gonna go ahead
and miss the decoy file.

32:48.033 --> 32:49.366
He has krumitz looking
in the wrong place.

32:49.368 --> 32:50.600
Nelson, these guys have
short tempers.

32:50.602 --> 32:51.969
Failure is not an option.

32:51.971 --> 32:52.970
Okay, look, uh...

32:52.972 --> 32:54.504
I have an idea.

33:02.146 --> 33:03.647
Open that folder
there, "installers."

33:03.649 --> 33:04.648
(groans)

33:04.650 --> 33:06.183
(keyboard clacking)

33:06.185 --> 33:07.384
Uh...

33:10.088 --> 33:12.089
You clicked the wrong folder,
you idiot.

33:12.091 --> 33:14.458
(sighs)
yes.

33:14.460 --> 33:17.160
No, I didn't. No, I didn't.

33:17.162 --> 33:18.628
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, is that it?

33:18.630 --> 33:20.063
Is that it?
Is that it?

33:21.065 --> 33:23.000
Henry:
That's it.

33:23.002 --> 33:25.002
Good.

33:25.004 --> 33:27.070
Load it on this.

33:33.177 --> 33:35.312
These men'll be leaving
soon, honey.

33:35.314 --> 33:38.081
This will all
be over, I promise.

33:38.083 --> 33:39.683
I said no talking.

33:39.685 --> 33:41.151
Of course.

33:41.153 --> 33:43.086
I apologize.

33:53.197 --> 33:55.766
My son needs to go
to the restroom.

33:55.768 --> 33:57.768
Yeah, well...

33:57.770 --> 33:59.169
He can hold it.

33:59.171 --> 34:01.772
And shut up.

34:04.142 --> 34:06.777
Get over there.

34:06.779 --> 34:08.412
It's about time, man--
did you get it?

34:08.414 --> 34:10.180
I got it, calm down.

34:11.649 --> 34:13.650
Jeremy:
This is taking too long, bro.

34:13.652 --> 34:16.186
We got to get out of here.

34:16.188 --> 34:17.754
Wait a second.

34:17.756 --> 34:20.190
It's payday.

34:26.831 --> 34:28.065
I'm in.

34:28.067 --> 34:30.600
These fools' internet.
It's gonna buy me

34:30.602 --> 34:32.169
Some time to find a passkey

34:32.171 --> 34:33.537
Before they discover
we slipped them a decoy.

34:33.539 --> 34:35.772
Things are getting tense
in there, nelson,

34:35.774 --> 34:37.507
We can't wait long.
I'm trying-- I know, I know.

34:39.310 --> 34:41.211
What the hell
is taking so long?

34:45.149 --> 34:46.149
Damn signal.

34:46.151 --> 34:47.284
What?

34:47.286 --> 34:49.152
Wi-fi isn't working--
give me a sec.

34:49.154 --> 34:50.420
Running a diagnostic.

34:53.691 --> 34:55.659
Now what?

34:59.397 --> 35:01.565
We got an intrusion.

35:01.567 --> 35:03.233
Son of a...

35:04.535 --> 35:05.702
(jeffrey whimpers)

35:05.704 --> 35:07.804
Shut that kid up
and start talking.

35:07.806 --> 35:09.206
We're running
out of time, nelson.

35:09.208 --> 35:10.540
I know, I know.

35:10.542 --> 35:12.275
Look, just-just wait, okay?

35:13.211 --> 35:15.345
Can't wait any longer.

35:15.347 --> 35:17.147
Jeremy:
I knew it.

35:17.149 --> 35:18.448
There's no way
these two are family.

35:18.450 --> 35:19.449
Look at that picture.

35:19.451 --> 35:21.418
That's the kid,
all right.

35:21.420 --> 35:23.186
But who the hell are these two?

35:24.122 --> 35:25.589
Henry: Something
ain't right here.

35:26.591 --> 35:28.125
Talk.

35:28.127 --> 35:29.259
Or die.

35:31.762 --> 35:33.530
Fbi!

35:33.532 --> 35:34.598
Get down.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.633
Down on the ground! Fbi!
Drop it now!

35:38.836 --> 35:40.370
Your hands where I can see them!

35:40.372 --> 35:41.404
Don't move!

35:45.443 --> 35:47.310
Everybody okay?

35:47.312 --> 35:48.311
You okay?

35:48.313 --> 35:49.346
Yeah.

35:50.815 --> 35:52.482
Clear!

35:52.484 --> 35:53.483
He'll live.

35:53.485 --> 35:54.484
Man:
Entry clear!

35:54.486 --> 35:55.485
Encrypted.

35:55.487 --> 35:56.653
We'll never get in.

35:56.655 --> 35:57.787
Did nelson get the file?

35:57.789 --> 35:59.556
I don't know--
couldn't wait.

35:59.558 --> 36:01.558
Nelson.

36:01.560 --> 36:02.926
Did you get
the passkey?

36:02.928 --> 36:04.694
Repeat-- did you
get the passkey?

36:04.696 --> 36:06.563
Oh, yeah, we got it.

36:06.565 --> 36:08.298
Those fools are going down.

36:17.875 --> 36:19.876
Okay.

36:19.878 --> 36:21.545
Bitcoins are back
in your account.

36:21.547 --> 36:23.547
Though you should
change your passkey.

36:23.549 --> 36:25.882
I won't need to.

36:25.884 --> 36:27.951
Getting out
of the bitcoin business.

36:30.621 --> 36:33.590
In fact,
we're selling the store.

36:35.359 --> 36:36.526
It's time.

36:36.528 --> 36:37.961
Thank you.

36:38.930 --> 36:40.630
(door closes)

36:41.599 --> 36:42.532
Pop.

36:46.837 --> 36:49.306
I'm sorry.

36:55.613 --> 36:58.548
Ellis: Promise me you'll
stay close to home.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.617
Stephen:
Always.

37:13.564 --> 37:14.598
You ever get sleep?

37:15.900 --> 37:18.435
You have any idea how much
paperwork is required

37:18.437 --> 37:20.437
After you discharge a
government-issued firearm?

37:20.439 --> 37:23.440
You know, I heard you handled
yourself pretty well.

37:23.442 --> 37:25.442
Came face-to-face
with an armed killer,

37:25.444 --> 37:27.444
Heard you took him down,
no hesitation.

37:27.446 --> 37:29.846
Come on, man,
you got some skills.

37:29.848 --> 37:31.548
Standard fbi training.

37:31.550 --> 37:33.250
(mocking):
"standard fbi training."

37:33.252 --> 37:34.251
No, n-n-no.

37:34.253 --> 37:35.585
You?

37:35.587 --> 37:37.654
You are
the real deal, bro.

37:37.656 --> 37:38.788
Well, I did what
I had to do.

37:38.790 --> 37:40.657
You know, a man with
a gun in your face,

37:40.659 --> 37:41.658
Kid in the room,

37:41.660 --> 37:42.792
Bad guy's got
to go down.

37:42.794 --> 37:44.661
Even if it was
only a flesh wound.

37:44.663 --> 37:46.663
I mean, really, it's just
instinct at that point.

37:46.665 --> 37:49.699
You know, training takes
over, muscle memory kicks in.

37:49.701 --> 37:51.534
And when that guy
made a move on me,

37:51.536 --> 37:53.536
His gun taking aim,

37:53.538 --> 37:56.273
Bayonet inches
from this face...

37:56.275 --> 37:57.607
Whose bayonet?

37:57.609 --> 37:59.609
...I could smell
the gunpowder residue.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.344
Appomattox, nelson.

38:01.346 --> 38:03.413
Appomattox.

38:03.415 --> 38:04.881
Hey.
Yo.

38:04.883 --> 38:07.617
All I knew was--
it was on.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.753
Him or me.

38:09.755 --> 38:12.022
And it wasn't gonna
be me.

38:12.024 --> 38:13.023
That's right, baby.

38:13.025 --> 38:14.357
That's why you here.

38:14.359 --> 38:15.992
(grunts)

38:15.994 --> 38:18.061
Daniel krumitz
coming through.

38:31.642 --> 38:32.776
Hey.

38:32.778 --> 38:36.313
â™ª sweetly touching my emotions

38:36.315 --> 38:37.614
â™ª I wanna stop

38:37.616 --> 38:38.615
(nelson grunts)

38:38.617 --> 38:40.083
â™ª and thank you, baby

38:40.085 --> 38:42.752
â™ª I just wanna stop

38:42.754 --> 38:44.754
â™ª and thank you, baby

38:44.756 --> 38:46.756
(imitates music)

38:46.758 --> 38:49.392
Ryan and nelson:
â™ª how sweet it is

38:49.394 --> 38:51.795
â™ª to be loved by you...

38:51.797 --> 38:52.896
No, you didn't.

38:52.898 --> 38:54.597
Yes, I did.

38:54.599 --> 38:57.467
(chuckles)

38:57.469 --> 38:59.469
You know, uh...

38:59.471 --> 39:00.937
It's my mother's
favorite song.

39:00.939 --> 39:03.006
Me and my pops used
to sing it to her

39:03.008 --> 39:04.674
Every year on
her birthday.

39:04.676 --> 39:07.077
Call your parents,
brody nelson.

39:08.479 --> 39:10.480
(sighs)
can't.

39:10.482 --> 39:12.982
It's just not
the same anymore.

39:12.984 --> 39:16.519
I embarrassed them,
went to jail.

39:16.521 --> 39:18.655
Just not the son they
thought they raised.

39:18.657 --> 39:20.890
Call them anyway.

39:20.892 --> 39:23.059
Why do I get the feeling
that giving my stuff back

39:23.061 --> 39:24.894
Is a part of one of
your master plans

39:24.896 --> 39:26.896
That elijah's always
talking about?

39:26.898 --> 39:28.865
I don't know.

39:34.071 --> 39:35.739
(scoffs)

39:35.741 --> 39:40.677
Ryan: â™ª how sweet it is
to be loved by you. â™ª

39:44.515 --> 39:46.816
(dialing)

39:46.818 --> 39:49.085
(line ringing)

39:52.623 --> 39:53.623
Man:
Hello.

39:53.625 --> 39:55.759
Hey, dad?

39:55.761 --> 39:57.160
Hey, it's brody.

40:00.097 --> 40:02.799
Yeah, no, it-it's me,
pop, it's me.
