02:59.954 --> 03:04.517
Nebraska Territory,
circa 1853.

03:32.450 --> 03:34.122
Come on, girls.

05:34.368 --> 05:37.206
- Hello, Bob.
- Afternoon, Miss Cuddy.

05:38.538 --> 05:40.740
Come on inside, I've got supper ready.

05:58.893 --> 06:03.345
The pie is made out of peaches... from a can.

06:04.732 --> 06:06.116
They had four of those cans.

06:06.316 --> 06:07.411
I don't know who got the other three,

06:07.612 --> 06:10.391
- I don't know who could afford 'em.
- It's good pie.

06:10.738 --> 06:14.612
If it pleases you, we might
have a postprandial recital.

06:16.286 --> 06:17.774
Okay, what?

06:20.165 --> 06:23.679
- A bit of music.
- I like music.

06:28.423 --> 06:32.557
♫ On the distant prairie,
where the <i>heather wild, ♫</i>

06:33.469 --> 06:38.138
<i>♫ In its quiet beauty liv'd and smiled, ♫</i>

06:38.338 --> 06:43.602
<i>♫ Stands a</i> little cottage,
and a creeping vine, ♫

06:44.064 --> 06:48.278
♫ Loves around its porch to twine. ♫

06:49.328 --> 06:54.186
<i>♫ In that peaceful dwelling
was a lovely child, ♫</i>

06:54.741 --> 06:59.866
♫ With her blue eyes
beaming soft and mild. ♫

07:00.956 --> 07:05.572
<i>♫ And the wavy ringlets
of her flaxen hair, ♫</i>

07:06.053 --> 07:10.093
<i>♫ Floating in the summer air. ♫</i>

07:10.975 --> 07:15.783
♫ Fair as a lily, joyous and free, ♫

07:16.472 --> 07:21.267
♫ Light of that prairie home was she. ♫

07:22.269 --> 07:27.005
♫ Ev'ryone who knew her felt the gentle pow'r ♫

07:27.567 --> 07:32.060
♫ Of Rosalie, "The Prairie Flower." ♫

07:42.499 --> 07:45.132
That sure was pretty singin', Miss Cuddy.

07:47.838 --> 07:50.798
- I got some cheese.
- Cheese?

07:51.800 --> 07:54.522
Yes, Ma'am, you know I've got
a few of your sheep now.

07:55.763 --> 07:56.544
I know.

07:56.972 --> 07:59.107
Well, I made some cheese outta their milk.

07:59.307 --> 08:01.729
I wonder if you'd like to have some.

08:02.060 --> 08:04.423
I've got some here in my pocket.

08:05.306 --> 08:07.435
The cheese would be a fine finish to our

08:07.635 --> 08:10.073
fried chicken dinner and
peach pie this evening.

08:10.778 --> 08:14.495
Well then, here it is.

08:33.467 --> 08:35.760
This is fine cheese, Bob.

08:38.432 --> 08:40.364
So why not marry?

08:43.270 --> 08:44.028
Do what?

08:44.229 --> 08:49.254
<i>Why not throw in together,</i>
land, animals, implement, lives,

08:50.110 --> 08:52.392
the whole ball of wax?

08:52.904 --> 08:56.678
<i>We could use my capital and</i>
know-how to improve your claim and mine.

08:58.160 --> 09:01.583
And if the union produces children,
so much the better.

09:02.372 --> 09:06.045
Looked at from any angle, it works.

09:10.506 --> 09:12.698
So why not marry?

09:13.926 --> 09:18.120
I reckon I'll go back
East to find me a wife.

09:18.556 --> 09:20.816
Please, Mr. Giffen,

09:21.016 --> 09:22.848
I won't take "No." for an answer.

09:24.395 --> 09:25.716
Miss Cuddy...

09:26.189 --> 09:28.281
I appreciate the offer and the supper,

09:28.399 --> 09:30.994
and the concert and all...

09:31.194 --> 09:33.329
but I cannot marry you.

09:33.529 --> 09:34.570
<i>Will not.</i>

09:34.780 --> 09:36.432
Won't.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.708
I ain't perfect,

09:38.952 --> 09:40.353
but you are too bossy.

09:42.247 --> 09:43.999
And too plum-damned plain.

10:12.303 --> 10:13.885
There ain't no medicine for it.

10:15.397 --> 10:19.281
This one here's still
breathing a little bit, Mama.

10:37.679 --> 10:38.700
She is dead.

10:39.847 --> 10:40.664
Mother is dead!
= Mor er død! =

10:41.057 --> 10:42.200
I'll take her outside.

10:42.225 --> 10:45.201
No! No! We must bury her properly!

10:46.063 --> 10:46.948
I'll prepare her.

10:47.522 --> 10:49.117
I'll take her outside
She is starting to smell.

10:49.399 --> 10:52.551
No! No! No!

10:54.154 --> 10:56.401
We must bury her properly!

10:58.200 --> 10:59.886
You wished for her to die.
= Du ønskede for hende at dø. =

11:01.203 --> 11:02.420
You hated her.
= Du hadede hende. =

11:02.913 --> 11:04.162
You hate me.
= Du hader mig. =

11:09.294 --> 11:10.565
Take her inside!
Let Go!

11:11.196 --> 11:12.898
Take her inside!
Let Go!

11:15.801 --> 11:17.572
Take her inside!

11:24.435 --> 11:24.936
Ice...

11:25.895 --> 11:26.395
Cold...

11:27.420 --> 11:29.622
FROZEN!

11:49.919 --> 11:51.612
Oh, my Jesus.

11:59.513 --> 12:01.941
To what do I owe this pleasure, Reverend?

12:02.141 --> 12:03.983
Springtime, Miss Cuddy.

12:04.434 --> 12:06.236
Are Clydene and the kids
getting along all right?

12:06.353 --> 12:08.530
Meaner than ever and
growing by the minute.

12:08.731 --> 12:11.283
Put your mule up and
come on inside the house.

12:18.491 --> 12:21.053
There's been some trouble amongst
the women here abouts.

12:24.705 --> 12:26.547
I've heard about it.

12:27.875 --> 12:29.547
It's bad.

12:31.587 --> 12:33.559
Guess what I'm ordering.

12:33.589 --> 12:36.296
- I couldn't.
- A Melodeon.

12:36.496 --> 12:39.562
- You are not!
- Yep, I don't trust shipping a piano...

12:39.762 --> 12:44.943
so, soon as I get into Loup I'm gonna
order a Mason & Hamlin Melodeon.

12:45.143 --> 12:47.719
You'll have the only Melodeon in the Territory.

12:49.064 --> 12:52.725
Back home I used to play
the piano by the hour.

12:53.944 --> 12:56.713
I can't live without
real music much longer.

12:59.658 --> 13:03.158
- I could help you with them dishes.
- I don't want any help with the dishes.

13:05.061 --> 13:06.332
So...

13:08.041 --> 13:10.674
How you gettin'
along with that Giffen boy?

13:13.464 --> 13:15.983
He uses my mules when I don't need them.

13:16.008 --> 13:17.985
He helps me with my corn.

13:18.010 --> 13:21.278
We planted some potatoes together
and we keep the fences up.

13:21.395 --> 13:25.003
How you getting along?

13:25.059 --> 13:26.854
When my bulls have finished their work here,

13:26.954 --> 13:28.660
I let him turn it turn up on his heifers.

13:28.855 --> 13:29.856
Well...

13:30.982 --> 13:33.006
Seems like you are getting
along <i>together all right.</i>

13:33.051 --> 13:33.052
These are by δΘΣτΘP⌠ß⌠Θ which is Greek to me.

13:33.109 --> 13:34.836
Feed him a meal every now and then.

13:34.861 --> 13:36.407
Like you do me.

13:37.196 --> 13:39.448
You're a good citizen, Mary Bee.

13:40.367 --> 13:41.938
The bed up on the
loft has fresh linen.

13:42.034 --> 13:46.035
I'll take the slop out to the hogs
before you go to sleep.

14:16.987 --> 14:18.826
You're gonna give me a son.

14:31.602 --> 14:33.842
You're gonna give me a son.

15:21.846 --> 15:22.346
Hell no!

15:24.974 --> 15:28.578
This here is a God damned free country, Dowd!
Can't nobody make me do it.

15:28.603 --> 15:31.879
Thou shalt not take the Lord's
name in vain, Vester.

15:32.079 --> 15:35.376
- Especially not in His own house.
- I won't go, I can't.

15:35.401 --> 15:36.346
Why not?

15:36.986 --> 15:39.914
In the name of our Savior, Vester.
I ask you, why not?

15:40.073 --> 15:43.233
<i>I can't take no time away from my crops
and I</i> got the girls to look after

15:43.326 --> 15:46.137
and I can't afford to pay for no wagon.

15:46.162 --> 15:49.672
- I ain't in on this deal.
- Then what are we gonna do about Theoline?

15:51.334 --> 15:52.833
Pitch her down a hole in the outhouse.

15:53.044 --> 15:55.997
You are a poor specimen of a man,
Vester Belknap!

16:00.093 --> 16:02.278
- I came here for the drawing.
- Me, too.

16:02.303 --> 16:03.417
Let's get it over with.

16:03.472 --> 16:05.969
<i>What about Vester?</i>
I'll draw for Vester.

16:06.307 --> 16:09.391
- What do you mean?
- I said I will draw for him.

16:09.591 --> 16:14.290
- What did she say?
- I said, "I will draw for Vester Belknap."

16:15.025 --> 16:16.503
Can we proceed?

16:18.612 --> 16:22.383
This is a painful occasion for you and
your families and I grieve for you.

16:22.408 --> 16:24.655
<i>Your wives are fine and godly women.</i>

16:25.702 --> 16:28.058
But life gave them more
than they could bear.

16:28.330 --> 16:29.351
Now we all draw lots.

16:31.709 --> 16:33.477
Whoever draws the black bean

16:33.502 --> 16:36.752
will carry the women home
to where they come from.

16:37.757 --> 16:39.079
<i>Shall we defer the lady?</i>

16:39.179 --> 16:41.235
- I'll draw last.
- I'll go first.

16:41.260 --> 16:43.576
Keep your hands closed until
everybody's drawn.

16:43.846 --> 16:47.533
Thor.
Miss Cuddy.

16:49.936 --> 16:51.828
Put your hands in a circle here.

16:52.522 --> 16:53.531
On the count of 3... 1...

16:53.731 --> 16:56.146
- If that bean in my hand is black. I dunno...
- 2...

16:56.209 --> 16:57.510
- Pass for it.
- 3.

16:59.604 --> 17:02.454
<i>Does that mean</i> Vester has to go?
<i>But he said he wouldn't.</i>

17:02.654 --> 17:06.269
He has to, he's one of us.
I baptized him.

17:06.391 --> 17:08.602
- I don't trust Vester.
- <i>Me neither.</i>

17:09.665 --> 17:14.709
It's true, Reverend,
Vester is a brute with no conscience.

17:15.295 --> 17:17.446
- I'll go.
- You can't.

17:17.673 --> 17:19.702
- Yes I will.
- Well, hell, a woman?

17:19.967 --> 17:22.069
I can ride as well as anybody.

17:22.094 --> 17:24.613
And handle a team and shoot.
You all know that.

17:24.637 --> 17:26.432
And I can cook and care for

17:26.457 --> 17:28.668
those women better
than any of you can.

17:28.776 --> 17:32.811
Hell, she's right,
<i>she's sure as hell right!</i>

17:32.911 --> 17:34.550
<i>That's mighty kind of you, Miss Cuddy.</i>

17:34.732 --> 17:37.543
<i>You tell us what</i> you need,
we'll... we'll see to it.

17:37.568 --> 17:39.768
- When will you leave?
- As soon as I can.

17:39.869 --> 17:41.025
Today is May 5th.

17:41.948 --> 17:44.671
She could be back in time to
celebrate 4th of July with us.

17:44.993 --> 17:46.900
Reverend Dowd, we cannot allow this.

17:47.495 --> 17:50.111
It is not a lone woman's place

17:50.211 --> 17:51.786
to drive a wagon across this country.

17:51.800 --> 17:56.094
Much less when it carries three of
the Lord's least capable children.

17:56.194 --> 17:58.682
Then why not go with me, Mrs. Linens,
we can do it together.

17:58.965 --> 18:01.360
You too, Mrs. Polhemus,
better still.

18:01.385 --> 18:04.682
No, you have husbands and family
to care for, as you should.

18:04.888 --> 18:09.242
But I do not, because I live uncommonly alone.

18:09.268 --> 18:11.783
Enough, please, be seated.

18:15.107 --> 18:17.694
I'm afraid you are all are
right about Mr. Belknap,

18:17.818 --> 18:21.763
he's untrustworthy with the
task of this gravity,

18:21.864 --> 18:23.703
and we need a Homesman.

18:24.491 --> 18:26.343
<i>We will do everything we can to equip and...</i>

18:26.368 --> 18:28.429
accommodate for this journey, Miss Cuddy.

18:30.456 --> 18:32.590
If you gentlemen will excuse me for a minute.

19:15.752 --> 19:18.484
- Come to look after your wagon?
- I did.

19:23.469 --> 19:29.546
- My Lord, what is that?
- It's a train wagon, traded for it last year.

19:29.892 --> 19:32.423
Since then it's been sittin'
out here in the snow.

19:33.145 --> 19:35.909
When Svendsen and Sours come
around here wantin' a wagon,

19:36.073 --> 19:39.532
I gave 'em a hell of a deal on it...
I give it to 'em.

19:40.194 --> 19:44.309
<i>I cut the windows a little bigger,
greased it real good,</i>

19:45.199 --> 19:47.687
set some new spokes and fellows.

19:48.327 --> 19:51.012
That's the just the right
thing for them women.

20:19.151 --> 20:22.220
I put a sliding bolt on that door.

20:23.155 --> 20:26.124
- What for?
- Lock them ladies in.

20:27.368 --> 20:30.986
- Why would I do that?
- Stop and think about it.

20:32.243 --> 20:33.244
Oh.

20:36.585 --> 20:37.927
What's that?

20:39.880 --> 20:42.161
You might wanna tie somethin' down.

20:43.442 --> 20:45.273
Puttin' in ten of 'em.

20:47.055 --> 20:50.479
Oh my, I'm not sure I'm ready.

20:50.680 --> 20:51.579
Are you scared?

20:52.727 --> 20:55.646
- A little.
<i>- Listen here, Mary Bee...</i>

20:55.980 --> 21:00.004
You got a passable rig, mules,

21:01.152 --> 21:05.070
and you're as good a man
as any man <i>here abouts.</i>

21:05.532 --> 21:08.730
<i>And you're doing a hell of a fine thing.</i>

21:08.993 --> 21:14.494
So go ahead on... get to it... and do it.

21:16.751 --> 21:19.974
- Does everybody know?
<i>- Yep.</i>

21:20.380 --> 21:23.742
- What are they say?
- Don't say nothin'.

21:26.011 --> 21:29.153
People like to talk death and taxes.

21:30.032 --> 21:35.953
<i>But when it comes to "crazy",</i>
they stay hushed up.

22:04.926 --> 22:06.219
Miss Cuddy!

22:10.724 --> 22:11.933
Mary Bee!

22:14.540 --> 22:16.284
Mary Bee!

22:16.485 --> 22:17.486
Whoa!

22:17.790 --> 22:17.791
These are by δΘΣτΘP⌠ß⌠Θ which is Greek to me.

22:19.274 --> 22:21.418
I tried to catch you in town,
but you was already gone.

22:21.443 --> 22:22.371
What do you want, Reverend?

22:22.419 --> 22:24.422
To give you these,
they're letters to the women's

22:24.428 --> 22:27.699
closest to kin around Hebron,
Iowa and on back East.

22:30.244 --> 22:32.721
Your journey will be long,
difficult and dangerous.

22:32.746 --> 22:33.847
I expect it will.

22:33.872 --> 22:35.153
Well, bless you woman.

22:35.499 --> 22:38.185
Bless you and keep you, you know I believe
in you, don't you, I truly do?

22:38.210 --> 22:39.411
I know it.

22:40.254 --> 22:41.957
I'd go in your place if I could.

22:46.343 --> 22:47.988
Now let us pray.

22:48.846 --> 22:53.992
Heavenly Father, look down upon my daughter.
Bless her in this undertaking.

22:54.143 --> 22:56.186
<i>Grant her thy strength,
guide her with thy grace that</i>

22:56.270 --> 22:58.382
she may carry home
these poor souls.

22:59.023 --> 23:00.112
We beg of Thee.

23:00.608 --> 23:03.059
In the name of Jesus Christ,
thy only begotten son

23:03.986 --> 23:05.144
<i>who gave his life</i>

23:06.781 --> 23:08.474
for the sins of man.

23:09.034 --> 23:10.136
Amen.

23:19.795 --> 23:23.097
Come on out outta there you
claim-jumpin' <i>sonofabitch.</i>

23:23.197 --> 23:27.861
<i>Come down in here and you'll be a sad bastard
as long as you live and that won't be very long.</i>

23:27.886 --> 23:32.010
<i>Send your account to Finnedy, the bastard!</i>
But this here is Bob Giffen's place.

23:32.089 --> 23:34.248
<i>Bob Giffen has gone and abandoned this place,</i>

23:34.410 --> 23:37.225
<i>and I have a filed a new claim with...</i>

23:37.425 --> 23:42.417
<i>Go on, get the hell off of my roof, or face
stiffle recourse, God damn it, I got lawyers.</i>

24:23.527 --> 24:25.570
We need to hang that son of a bitch!

24:29.846 --> 24:31.246
C'mon!

24:59.564 --> 25:02.583
- Are you are an angel?
- You're not dead.

25:02.608 --> 25:06.177
Help me.
<i>Would you help me?</i>

25:06.529 --> 25:10.058
- For God sake?
- Suppose I do?

25:11.159 --> 25:12.658
What would you do for me?

25:12.828 --> 25:16.267
Anything! Anything!
As God is my witness!

25:16.623 --> 25:19.424
If I cut you down, will you
do what I tell you to?

25:19.525 --> 25:21.104
Hell, yes I will!
Swear to God!

25:21.204 --> 25:23.172
- You swear to it?
- I swear.

25:23.213 --> 25:27.391
Swear to that Almighty God
you've been talkin' about?

25:29.511 --> 25:32.508
Vengeance is Mine,
sayeth the Lord, and

25:33.265 --> 25:34.967
bringin' in sheaves, and...

25:36.060 --> 25:37.389
<i>do unto others, and...</i>

25:37.453 --> 25:40.168
if you cut me down from
this God damned tree,

25:41.282 --> 25:44.935
I'll do anything you tell me to,
I swear on God's holy name.

25:45.652 --> 25:46.947
Please.

25:53.210 --> 25:56.733
All right, I'll save you.

26:07.425 --> 26:09.536
I got a job'll work for you.

26:24.401 --> 26:31.164
But if you try and hurt me or you
try and run away... I'll kill you.

26:38.791 --> 26:40.349
Take off the noose.

26:59.687 --> 27:02.153
I need to collect my possibles.

27:11.190 --> 27:14.010
- This is Bob Giffen's place.
- I never met him.

27:14.035 --> 27:16.078
- What happened to his sheep?
- I ate 'em.

27:16.705 --> 27:20.678
Now you've been blasted out by vigilantes
and hanged for jumping Bob's claim.

27:20.750 --> 27:22.477
Hell! That's abandoned.
Now look at it.

27:22.502 --> 27:24.341
He didn't abandon nothing.

27:24.546 --> 27:26.861
He just went back East, to find himself a wife.

27:29.384 --> 27:30.746
It's abandoned.

27:33.848 --> 27:35.005
It sure is.

27:39.729 --> 27:41.227
This is abandoned.

27:43.107 --> 27:44.120
Damn.

28:04.629 --> 28:08.316
Unhitch and stable the mules
<i>then tend to my mare, Dorothy,</i>

28:08.341 --> 28:11.624
<i>and see to it that all the stock
on the place</i> is fed and watered.

28:12.387 --> 28:14.179
Your horse needs feed, too.

28:16.291 --> 28:19.487
Well, if you don't care to, I will,
and then your supper'll be an hour late!

28:26.042 --> 28:28.522
<i>Get up that wagon!
Get up here now! C'mon!</i>

28:29.222 --> 28:30.541
Step up!

28:32.435 --> 28:35.037
<i>C'mon!
Get on there!</i>

28:47.882 --> 28:49.652
Cleanup before you come in.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.866
What's this job of work you have in mind?

29:39.276 --> 29:42.701
I would be grateful if you not
use my good chair that way.

29:45.148 --> 29:47.167
My name is Cuddy,
Mary Bee Cuddy.

29:47.192 --> 29:49.741
- Where is Mr. Cuddy?
- I'm unmarried.

29:50.529 --> 29:51.618
What's the job?

29:54.117 --> 29:57.045
Three women in this country
have lost their mind...

29:57.203 --> 29:59.722
their husbands can't care for them properly.

29:59.747 --> 30:03.906
You and I are gonna take them
back across the river to Iowa.

30:04.293 --> 30:06.354
- The Missouri River?
- We'll leave tomorrow.

30:06.379 --> 30:08.354
Hell, that's five God damn weeks from here!

30:08.682 --> 30:11.886
I will not sit still for
profanity in my house.

30:12.086 --> 30:13.859
I can see why you're single!

30:19.518 --> 30:22.272
I need someone who can hunt
and guide and spell me at the rains,

30:22.699 --> 30:24.368
<i>help with the animals on the trip.</i>

30:24.685 --> 30:29.624
That's why I set you free.
It's your job and you're sworn to do it.

30:31.071 --> 30:34.543
Three crazy women for five weeks
is a lot more than I bargained for.

30:34.866 --> 30:39.513
If you've lied to me, and intend
on abandoning your responsibility,

30:39.538 --> 30:41.581
then you are a man of low character,

30:42.707 --> 30:46.384
more, disgusting pig than honorable man.

30:46.628 --> 30:48.230
Thank you for the kind words, Sister.

30:48.263 --> 30:52.149
You're no prize yourself, you're plain
as an old tin pail and you are bossy!

30:54.128 --> 30:57.165
But I'll sit out with you,
because I said I would.

30:57.473 --> 31:00.478
And I'll help you tend your cuckoo-cuckoo
clocks as long as <i>it suits me.</i>

31:00.578 --> 31:03.783
<i>However, I will up and</i> leave
when, where and if I please.

31:03.883 --> 31:07.963
Now, if you don't mind me asking you,
where the hell is my God damned bed?

31:08.193 --> 31:11.607
In the stable, where you belong.

31:32.884 --> 31:35.166
What are you doing, Mother?
= Hvad laver du, Mor? =

31:35.471 --> 31:37.425
I'm sweeping.
= Jeg feje. =

31:37.625 --> 31:39.541
You see I'm sweeping.

31:40.351 --> 31:41.728
Why?
= Hvorfor =

31:42.603 --> 31:44.621
Why are you sweeping?
= Hvorfor feje du? =

31:44.821 --> 31:47.062
God is in our house.
= Gud er i vores hus. =

31:48.109 --> 31:51.300
Our house was always clean.

31:55.908 --> 31:58.938
Mom, you've lost your mind.

31:59.411 --> 32:01.752
Soil is made of dust.

32:02.248 --> 32:05.093
You'll dust off the dust?

32:06.711 --> 32:09.679
This house will be clean.

32:14.511 --> 32:18.004
Cleanliness is next to godliness.
= Renlighed er ud for guddommelighed. =

32:23.228 --> 32:27.994
♫ Yonder, where the road bends, ♫
= Hist, hvor vejen slår en bugt, =

32:28.194 --> 32:31.814
♫ There is a house so beautiful. ♫

32:32.029 --> 32:35.382
♫ Yonder, where the road bends, ♫

32:35.523 --> 32:38.871
♫ There is a house so beautiful. ♫
= Ligger der et hus så smukt. =

33:41.433 --> 33:43.136
The wind's blown all the corn over.

33:45.062 --> 33:46.631
I know it.

33:48.107 --> 33:50.986
All we can do is burn
the cobs in the stove.

33:51.986 --> 33:54.375
There ain't no corn for us to eat.

33:54.554 --> 33:58.237
Just cobs... just bare old cobs.

33:58.576 --> 34:00.995
- I know it.
- The wheat and goats are dead.

34:01.020 --> 34:01.937
I know that.

34:03.163 --> 34:07.237
What do you know?
Are you crazy?

34:20.931 --> 34:23.193
<i>Pull up here. Whoa.</i>

34:23.484 --> 34:26.174
- You better lock me in the wagon.
- Why?

34:26.274 --> 34:28.380
Well, I cheated one rope I
don't wanna change to another.

34:28.429 --> 34:32.847
- Them sons of bitches'll try to hang me again.
- Oh, you might be recognized.

34:54.882 --> 34:57.970
- You got any money?
- Some. Why?

34:58.087 --> 35:02.574
I need 3 boxes of paper cartridges
for a Navy Colt's 36 and a jug of whiskey.

35:02.599 --> 35:05.563
- Bullets maybe, but no whiskey.
- Why not?

35:05.636 --> 35:09.285
Can't have you gettin' drunk around
poor, defenseless women... no.

35:09.385 --> 35:12.281
Well, then, I won't go East with you!
Goodbye, Cuddy!

35:22.329 --> 35:25.499
<i>- What's your name?</i>
- That's my business.

35:25.599 --> 35:27.511
I'm going to the bank
and I need your name.

35:28.385 --> 35:30.989
Oh, well, we'll say "George".

35:31.188 --> 35:32.805
George what?

35:35.550 --> 35:38.997
- Briggs.
<i>- George</i> Briggs.

35:39.197 --> 35:45.946
<i>That's right,
George</i> Briggs, George Briggs.

36:04.872 --> 36:06.379
Read this.

36:10.128 --> 36:11.619
Here, I'll read it for you.

36:12.046 --> 36:16.943
Mr. George Briggs, care of Mrs. Altha Carter,
Lady's Aid Society Methodist Church, Hebron, Iowa.

36:16.968 --> 36:17.512
So?

36:18.052 --> 36:22.218
I put banknotes for $300 inside
this envelope, just for you.

36:22.440 --> 36:24.071
Well, why not let me have it now?

36:24.100 --> 36:26.682
Right this minute I'm going to the
Post Office to put it in the mail.

36:26.782 --> 36:28.175
Why not carry it along with us?

36:28.187 --> 36:30.503
<i>When we get to Hebron,</i> Mrs. Carter
will have it for you.

36:49.526 --> 36:53.651
<i>Her boy's not very not old,
we'll have to watch him close.</i>

36:53.655 --> 36:56.582
I don't know what he'll do
when we take Arabella away.

37:32.212 --> 37:33.424
Ma'am...

37:42.263 --> 37:45.468
Well there she is, <i>my wife, Belle.</i>

37:46.685 --> 37:48.932
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Sours.

37:52.358 --> 37:55.980
<i>She won't say nothin', Miss Cuddy,
she just sets</i> and looks out the window.

37:59.698 --> 38:01.933
It's like her body's all stoved-up.

38:04.996 --> 38:06.870
I have to carry her to the outhouse,

38:07.048 --> 38:10.392
undress her nights, <i>dress her in the morning.</i>

38:10.417 --> 38:12.371
How long she been like this?

38:13.504 --> 38:14.049
Ever since...

38:17.884 --> 38:19.660
I don't even know her no more.

38:22.138 --> 38:23.832
How old is your wife?

38:24.032 --> 38:25.517
Nineteen.

38:25.767 --> 38:28.747
- And you?
- Twenty one

38:29.646 --> 38:30.797
I see.

38:34.792 --> 38:38.682
My, but she was beautiful, <i>Miss Cuddy.</i>

38:39.364 --> 38:41.195
She may be once again.

38:42.492 --> 38:46.789
<i>Mr. Briggs, will ya winter-up your
leisure long enough to lend a hand?</i> Now!

39:19.072 --> 39:21.220
I wish you God's comfort, Garn.

39:25.328 --> 39:27.756
Here... there's this, too.

39:28.873 --> 39:32.128
<i>Her grandma's wedding gift,
I reckon</i> it should go with her.

39:32.794 --> 39:36.080
I'll keep it for her and
see she takes it home.

39:36.506 --> 39:41.102
We'll be back in a few weeks, you'll hear from
or meet the Reverend Dowd that she's safe.

39:49.186 --> 39:50.524
Goodbye!

39:56.393 --> 39:58.296
Goodbye!

39:59.321 --> 40:00.888
You don't love me?

40:01.741 --> 40:03.103
You won't even look at me.

40:04.827 --> 40:06.802
You don't give a tinker's damn.

40:08.038 --> 40:10.481
Just go on home and play
with that damn doll.

40:11.125 --> 40:12.848
<i>Leave me up against it.</i>

40:15.921 --> 40:17.547
You don't love me?

40:19.475 --> 40:23.200
- G'bye.
- Go on, get, you can just go to hell.

40:24.133 --> 40:24.815
G'bye!

40:27.308 --> 40:28.942
You don't love me.

40:39.821 --> 40:41.183
Good morning, Mr. Svendsen.

40:43.199 --> 40:44.487
Come in.

40:50.031 --> 40:53.257
- She's ready.
- Why is she tied?

40:53.358 --> 40:56.355
"God will strike you down",
she says to me.

41:07.349 --> 41:09.199
She thinks she's God.

41:14.390 --> 41:17.759
Her cousin will pick her up in Iowa
and take her to asylum.

41:17.927 --> 41:19.008
Stop it!

41:21.078 --> 41:22.938
What a pain you are!
= ...du der. =

41:33.543 --> 41:35.739
How will we get her loaded?

41:43.553 --> 41:45.205
Unbolt the wagon door.

41:45.888 --> 41:48.130
Stop it!
Stop it!

41:48.330 --> 41:49.331
Stop.

41:53.538 --> 41:55.239
Open the wagon door!

42:03.323 --> 42:05.293
Help me, push her in.

42:09.162 --> 42:12.644
Do not untie her,
she'll try to kill you.

42:12.916 --> 42:15.537
She'll try to kill her, too.
Drop out!

42:22.218 --> 42:23.362
What are you doing with that son of a bitch?

42:23.461 --> 42:25.828
- Oh, no.
- He's going with us.

42:25.855 --> 42:27.978
<i>He's the one who tried to
take over </i> Bob Giffen's place.

42:28.191 --> 42:30.571
I need help,
surely you understand!

42:30.772 --> 42:32.587
He was suppose to hang.

42:33.537 --> 42:36.120
- Mr. Svendsen.
- Get down off that wagon.

42:37.622 --> 42:41.392
Get down off that wagon right now,
or I will shoot you where you sit.

42:41.429 --> 42:45.299
I can't do this alone,
I need him, now you leave us be!

42:46.170 --> 42:47.775
Get us moving.

42:49.771 --> 42:53.980
You boys didn't have balls to hang me!
You wanted my horse to do it for you, didn't ya?

42:54.050 --> 42:56.224
C'mon! Let's go.

42:56.424 --> 42:58.193
C'mon, first, c'mon.

42:59.256 --> 43:01.554
Keep that gun on that son of a bitch.

43:05.930 --> 43:10.701
I'll watch over your wife, Mr. Svendsen,
I promise, she'll be safe with me.

43:55.564 --> 43:56.994
I'm giving you my seed.

43:58.066 --> 43:59.599
But you refuse.

44:02.237 --> 44:05.160
You'll receive my seed, woman.

44:05.824 --> 44:07.822
You'll give birth to our child.

44:36.898 --> 44:39.165
You girls go to your room
while I talk to your mama.

44:52.039 --> 44:54.422
Theoline, this is Mary Bee.

44:54.541 --> 44:56.652
- Undo!
- Undo your hands? I am.

44:57.169 --> 44:58.807
Undo, undo.

44:59.207 --> 45:01.407
<i>Undo, undo, undo.</i>

45:01.607 --> 45:02.908
Do you know me, Theoline?

45:02.932 --> 45:04.333
Undo, undo, undo.

45:04.426 --> 45:08.247
Line, darling,
I am Mary Bee, your friend.

45:10.433 --> 45:11.891
Don't you know me?

45:37.251 --> 45:41.169
Now listen, girls,
your mother's very sick.

45:43.424 --> 45:47.440
But she loves you just the
same as she always has.

45:47.640 --> 45:50.436
And you must love her, too, and
help as much as you can.

45:51.190 --> 45:54.054
There are some things
I want you to do for her.

45:54.127 --> 45:57.360
I want you to undress her,
heat some water,

45:57.689 --> 46:01.860
and give her a nice bath,
with soap, from face to feet.

46:02.069 --> 46:04.784
- Right on the bed?
- Right on the bed.

46:05.489 --> 46:08.068
Wash and dry her hair, too,
then brush and comb it.

46:08.325 --> 46:13.457
Then find some clean clothes for her
and underwear, and dress her again.

46:16.826 --> 46:21.783
And while you do all this, I want you
to smile at her and say kind things.

46:22.840 --> 46:27.566
- Do you know a little song you can sing?
- We know "Flow gently, Sweet Afton"

46:27.862 --> 46:30.074
That would be fine.

46:30.931 --> 46:34.708
And when you've finished all this, I want
you to do some chores for your father, too.

46:35.486 --> 46:37.677
You're now the ladies of the house.

46:38.523 --> 46:42.241
I want you to sweep it out,
wash the dirty dishes,

46:42.341 --> 46:48.204
take the bedding outdoors and air it...
show him how grown up you are.

46:48.574 --> 46:51.126
Will you do that for him, for me?

46:52.537 --> 46:56.065
Now, all right, now start singing.

46:56.374 --> 46:59.007
♫ Flow gently, sweet Afton ♫

46:59.107 --> 47:01.806
- Good, and remember...
- ♫ Among thy green braes ♫

47:02.088 --> 47:04.987
- love your dear mother.
- ♫ Flow gently, I'll sing thee ♫

47:05.087 --> 47:09.030
- Now, you get busy as bees, give me these foreheads.
- ♫ a song in thy praise ♫

47:09.388 --> 47:15.235
<i>♫ Flow gently, I'll sing thee
a song in thy praise ♫</i>

47:15.352 --> 47:20.200
<i>♫ My Mary's asleep by
thy murmuring stream. ♫</i>

47:20.899 --> 47:26.256
<i>♫ Flow gently, sweet Afton,
disturb not her dream. ♫</i>

47:26.697 --> 47:31.257
<i>♫ Thou stock-dove whose echo
resounds tho' the glen ♫</i>

47:31.357 --> 47:36.572
<i>♫ Ye wild whistling
blackbirds in yon thorny den, ♫</i>

47:36.672 --> 47:38.565
<i>♫ Thou green-crested lapwing... ♫</i>

47:52.265 --> 47:54.327
Mrs. Svendsen, is that you?

47:58.355 --> 48:00.357
Please, stop wailing, Mrs. Svendsen.

48:03.068 --> 48:06.358
Mrs. Svendsen, I asked you to stop.
Please do!

48:12.703 --> 48:13.884
Stop!

48:14.062 --> 48:16.483
Mrs. Svendsen, stop!

49:06.466 --> 49:09.216
<i>Do you think these mules'll make it
all the way to the Missouri river?</i>

49:10.387 --> 49:12.702
I doubt it, not without a good feeding of corn.

49:13.473 --> 49:16.411
The one flickin' her ears, she knows
she's the subject of our discussion.

49:16.511 --> 49:19.591
She's a thinker,
the other one's a worker.

49:20.397 --> 49:21.930
They should have names,
what should we name 'em?

49:22.032 --> 49:25.773
Mules don't need names, they need feed,
and corn's the best there is.

49:26.195 --> 49:29.881
I'll name that one Grace,
and that one Redemption.

49:30.908 --> 49:33.238
My mare, her name's Dorothy, after my sister.

49:33.453 --> 49:37.273
She's married to a doctor up in New York state,
that's where we're from.

49:38.040 --> 49:41.627
Dorothy has a little 6 year
old boy and a baby on the way.

49:43.629 --> 49:45.835
Our mother died when we were little girls.

49:51.137 --> 49:52.732
What's your horse's name?

49:54.349 --> 49:55.500
Brown.

50:34.807 --> 50:38.466
You didn't give me the two damned skinny
blankets, it gets cold at night out here!

50:38.566 --> 50:39.932
You noticed.

50:41.105 --> 50:43.989
We need to head south-east,
follow the river bottoms.

50:43.991 --> 50:45.573
No.

50:46.694 --> 50:49.894
We'll meet more people that way
in case we need help.

50:50.031 --> 50:52.049
Ya know, only three kinds of people out here,

50:52.074 --> 50:54.730
you gonna meet wagon trains that
don't want to see crazy people.

50:54.786 --> 50:56.971
You gonna meet freighters
who will surely rape you,

50:57.066 --> 51:00.343
and you gonna meet Indians
who'll kill ya... and then rape you...

51:00.543 --> 51:04.116
after they kill me!
No, we're gonna go straight east to the river.

51:04.216 --> 51:06.234
We're haulin' an odd lot of freight.

51:06.506 --> 51:08.413
They are not freight,
they are human beings.

51:08.716 --> 51:11.187
- They're crazy.
- They are precious to the Lord.

51:11.269 --> 51:15.061
Precious to me, too.
Give me that skillet, about $300 worth.

51:16.600 --> 51:18.777
Wake up! Time to get moving!

51:23.023 --> 51:24.524
Get up and go pee!

51:28.279 --> 51:29.829
C'mon there, girl.

51:36.787 --> 51:39.473
Watch your head on the
hub there, baby, c'mon.

51:40.874 --> 51:42.063
C'mon.

51:55.849 --> 51:57.019
There ya go.

51:59.603 --> 52:00.813
Pee.

52:01.555 --> 52:03.533
God damn!

52:08.903 --> 52:11.578
Squat down.
Squat down!

52:12.782 --> 52:13.997
Now pee!

53:11.217 --> 53:14.566
God... will strike you down.

56:43.394 --> 56:46.666
God will strike you down.

56:52.695 --> 56:54.125
I love trees.

56:55.281 --> 56:59.901
I don't get to see very many trees...
I miss them.

57:02.372 --> 57:03.393
God will strike you...

57:05.917 --> 57:11.633
New York... has lots of trees.

57:54.549 --> 57:57.767
Surely you wouldn't defile and desecrate.

57:58.094 --> 58:02.553
You are horrible... and morbid!

58:11.568 --> 58:13.826
I don't wanna be cold anymore
when I'm trying to sleep.

58:14.571 --> 58:17.180
I need this buffalo hide,
and that dead Indian don't.

58:32.047 --> 58:34.067
I was in the Dragoons.

58:35.050 --> 58:37.961
Company C,
1st. U.S. Division.

58:39.221 --> 58:40.741
<i>Fort Kearney.</i>

58:42.266 --> 58:47.182
Had us a right smart scuffle one time down
there in Kansas with them God damned Kiowas!

58:48.230 --> 58:52.352
- Tell me.
- We were headed out to Fort Leavenworth.

58:53.027 --> 58:57.665
Supply train, 6 mule wagons and a herd of 300 horses.

58:57.990 --> 59:01.503
And we had Kiowas like flees trailing us!

59:01.619 --> 59:06.335
War paint, sassy,
big as life and twice as natural.

59:07.125 --> 59:11.406
- Wanted them horses.
- I see.

59:11.712 --> 59:14.845
<i>Well, we camped down on the
Arkansas</i> River one night,

59:15.341 --> 59:19.282
and them teamsters picketed 36 mules and

59:19.387 --> 59:22.361
they picketed 300 horses in the sand.

59:22.562 --> 59:27.709
Sand, hell, them picket pens wouldn't
hold a prairie dog in that sand.

59:28.522 --> 59:32.064
Sure enough, that night,
Kiowas come through there

59:32.265 --> 59:35.879
and stampeded the whole
bunch and away they went.

59:37.823 --> 59:39.758
<i>Trampled the wagons all to pieces,</i>

59:39.783 --> 59:42.216
<i>got the stock all tangled up in the ropes,</i>

59:42.266 --> 59:44.604
and crippled-up with the flying picket fence,

59:44.689 --> 59:48.740
and them Kiowas just running through
there hooping and hollerin'.

59:49.877 --> 59:52.162
My, oh, my, wasn't we riled?

59:52.797 --> 59:57.903
We blew the bugle... boots and saddles and
away went after 'em with the sun risin'.

59:58.010 --> 01:00:00.730
We caught Kiowas here and we caught Kiowas there,

01:00:00.763 --> 01:00:03.531
and we caught 'em in bunches and
killed every one of 'em.

01:00:05.184 --> 01:00:06.836
We rounded up our stock and
drove it right through the

01:00:06.843 --> 01:00:10.202
middle of the God damned
Kiowa camp... tore it all to hell.

01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:19.586
Pretty fair job of work...
Company C 1st U.S. Dragoon!

01:00:20.408 --> 01:00:23.198
Well, how interesting.

01:00:27.515 --> 01:00:33.115
♫ I don't want none o' your weevily wheat,
I don't want none o' your barley. ♫

01:00:33.215 --> 01:00:38.035
♫ I'll take some flour and half an hour
and bake a cake for Charley. ♫

01:00:41.179 --> 01:00:46.281
♫ The higher up the cherry tree,
The sweeter grows the cherry. ♫

01:00:46.644 --> 01:00:51.449
♫ The more you hug and kiss a gal
The more she'll want to marry. ♫

01:00:54.042 --> 01:00:58.144
♫ Charlie, he's a fine young boy
Charlie, he's a dandy. ♫

01:00:58.497 --> 01:01:04.372
♫ Every time he goes town
He'll bring the gal some candy. ♫

01:01:19.343 --> 01:01:22.036
<i>- What are they?
- Pawnee, probably.</i>

01:01:24.849 --> 01:01:26.922
- What was that?
- Bugle.

01:01:27.227 --> 01:01:30.735
Somewhere along the line they
killed themselves a U.S. cavalry bugler.

01:01:35.402 --> 01:01:37.732
- What do they want?
- Whatever we got.

01:01:38.233 --> 01:01:41.777
The trouble is they don't know what that is...
<i>they've never seen a wagon like this.</i>

01:01:41.878 --> 01:01:47.602
<i>Could be goods inside,</i> soldiers,
anything to them, hell, they don't know.

01:01:49.458 --> 01:01:51.450
I count four rifles amongst 'em.

01:01:59.259 --> 01:02:01.453
If they think we're worth
the trouble, we're dead.

01:02:03.806 --> 01:02:05.575
I'll try to buy 'em off.

01:02:15.068 --> 01:02:17.921
<i>Something happens to me, they</i>
come all the way down here,

01:02:17.946 --> 01:02:19.810
don't you fool with that carbine.

01:02:20.115 --> 01:02:21.778
You get in the wagon <i>quick as you can,</i>

01:02:21.807 --> 01:02:25.281
you shoot the women in the
head, then shoot yourself.

01:02:26.454 --> 01:02:28.494
You got four good rounds.

01:02:56.811 --> 01:02:58.423
C'mon, turn around here.

01:02:58.888 --> 01:03:01.747
C'mon, turn around here.
Get outta here!

01:03:18.174 --> 01:03:22.871
- What will they do with Dorothy?
- They'll probably eat her.

01:04:13.815 --> 01:04:15.786
No! No!

01:04:26.753 --> 01:04:28.360
What the hell?

01:04:41.885 --> 01:04:46.664
<i>She's gone, Mr. Briggs!</i> Mr. Briggs, she's gone.
She's <i>gone, we have to get her back!</i>

01:04:46.790 --> 01:04:51.099
- Cuddy, it was a God dammed horse.
- Get up, you lout.

01:05:07.086 --> 01:05:10.170
She hasn't taken a step by herself
since we put her on the wagon.

01:05:10.331 --> 01:05:12.021
<i>Hells Bells.</i>

01:05:14.369 --> 01:05:16.576
That gal done run off.

01:05:33.814 --> 01:05:35.315
- Morning!
- Morning!

01:05:36.692 --> 01:05:38.239
Where you from, friend?

01:05:38.485 --> 01:05:41.037
Freight train,
camped down south a little ways.

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:44.619
- Big, eh?
- Thirty wagons, six yolk.

01:05:44.719 --> 01:05:47.135
Two weeks ago outta Fall City
headed for Salt Lake.

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:51.680
- You the driver?
- I am, out hunting' meat, you seen any?

01:05:51.757 --> 01:05:54.708
No not today, I'm out looking
for this young lady here.

01:05:56.087 --> 01:05:59.284
- She's lost.
- She ain't now.

01:06:00.632 --> 01:06:04.334
Friend, I got a frame wagon back there,

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:07.826
I'm carrying three crazy
women to a church in Iowa

01:06:08.032 --> 01:06:11.292
so they can go home back East.

01:06:11.393 --> 01:06:13.096
This young girl is one of 'em.

01:06:14.105 --> 01:06:16.937
She's married, her name is Sours.

01:06:18.042 --> 01:06:20.740
She had three little children,
and lost 'em all

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:24.973
to the diphtheria... in short order
and she lost her mind.

01:06:25.992 --> 01:06:28.083
She run away from us last night.

01:06:29.579 --> 01:06:32.078
- I'm her friend.
- So am I.

01:06:32.278 --> 01:06:35.029
So you wouldn't wanna
her not to waste you here.

01:06:35.229 --> 01:06:37.569
She can spread her legs, can't she?

01:06:40.182 --> 01:06:43.953
I can tell you what,
why don't we leave it to her.

01:06:44.427 --> 01:06:48.590
See here sweet thing,
who'd you rather go with, him or me?

01:06:51.602 --> 01:06:53.985
Well, there you be, she caught
me stunned me already.

01:06:54.146 --> 01:06:58.153
- Friend, I'm taking this girl home.
- Not likely, she's mine now.

01:06:58.734 --> 01:07:03.519
Possession is nine points of the law,
and it's all of us out here now, ain't it?

01:07:03.581 --> 01:07:08.126
- Sorry, I'll just have to have her.
- God Almighty!

01:07:11.122 --> 01:07:12.321
Fight you for her.

01:07:12.521 --> 01:07:14.551
Best man takes the prize, how's that?

01:07:14.651 --> 01:07:16.752
- I'm agreeable.
- All right.

01:07:17.161 --> 01:07:20.988
When I say "Pitch",
we pitch these guns, how's that?

01:07:21.090 --> 01:07:22.543
Anytime.

01:07:24.719 --> 01:07:25.219
Pitch!

01:07:28.139 --> 01:07:30.006
God Almighty!

01:07:31.851 --> 01:07:35.672
- Say it again and act right this time.
- Pitch!

01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:56.508
Goodbye.

01:08:57.356 --> 01:08:59.133
Did you have to take an eternity?

01:09:00.651 --> 01:09:02.276
She's nearly froze to death.

01:09:04.238 --> 01:09:06.756
You lost one horse, Cuddy,
here's you another one.

01:09:06.782 --> 01:09:09.635
- Who did you get this horse?
- Man let us have him.

01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:12.953
- Why would he do that?
- Because he was dead, Mrs. Sours shot him.

01:09:39.441 --> 01:09:44.136
<i>- Who would do such a thing?</i>
- Indians... for the clothes.

01:10:05.759 --> 01:10:06.894
Wolves.

01:10:19.983 --> 01:10:24.106
"Cissy Hahn, eleven years, two months, nine days."

01:10:24.495 --> 01:10:27.609
"God loved her and took her home onto Him."

01:10:28.082 --> 01:10:29.998
Let's go, Cuddy.

01:10:31.661 --> 01:10:33.576
I intend to tidy up this grave.

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:35.932
- <i>Getting late.</i>
- I don't care.

01:10:35.957 --> 01:10:38.125
Well, suit yourself, I'm goin' home.

01:10:39.085 --> 01:10:41.401
Then, I'll take a horse
and join you later.

01:10:41.755 --> 01:10:43.227
Not mine you won't.

01:10:44.374 --> 01:10:46.540
You'll have to ride that train horse.

01:10:50.597 --> 01:10:52.700
I want a shovel, too.

01:11:13.779 --> 01:11:16.606
Oh, Sweet Merciful Father,

01:11:19.084 --> 01:11:20.755
Prince Jesus,

01:11:21.379 --> 01:11:22.754
Good Shepherd,

01:11:23.214 --> 01:11:25.211
Harvester of righteousnesses,

01:11:27.135 --> 01:11:29.737
take thee this token
and bury them deep,

01:11:31.431 --> 01:11:36.189
carry in...carry in,
in love let us sleep.

01:11:36.436 --> 01:11:39.092
Send me summons to wed Thee one day.

01:11:40.899 --> 01:11:46.493
Love us, and love me, Oh, love me, I pray.

01:11:52.043 --> 01:11:53.408
Amen.

01:15:20.291 --> 01:15:25.385
Why, why, why did you
light a fire for me?

01:15:40.312 --> 01:15:42.235
What about supper?

01:15:46.651 --> 01:15:49.035
I did light a fire for you, Cuddy.

01:15:52.282 --> 01:15:53.848
Where's that shovel?

01:15:55.702 --> 01:16:01.549
I lost the goddamn shovel!
Who cares about a shovel?

01:16:03.210 --> 01:16:07.753
- You... are... insane!
- The hell I am, Cuddy.

01:16:07.806 --> 01:16:12.736
I'm tryin' to move a load to the river
quick as I can and draw that $300.

01:16:12.761 --> 01:16:14.451
And that's all there is!

01:16:15.973 --> 01:16:17.941
There ain't no more.

01:16:57.349 --> 01:16:59.667
<i>♫ If I should prosper, ♫</i>

01:17:00.352 --> 01:17:02.689
<i>♫ Hear my heart pray, ♫.</i>

01:17:03.397 --> 01:17:08.279
<i>♫ Send me a summons to wed thee one day. ♫</i>

01:17:09.111 --> 01:17:13.448
<i>♫ Take me this token and love me all ways. ♫</i>

01:17:15.701 --> 01:17:20.751
♫ But if I should perish, Thy promises keep. ♫

01:17:22.041 --> 01:17:27.009
♫ Take thee our two hearts and bury them here. ♫

01:17:28.047 --> 01:17:34.208
♫ Take Thee our tokens and love let us sleep. ♫

01:17:59.746 --> 01:18:03.459
- I couldn't sleep.
- I could.

01:18:03.709 --> 01:18:05.909
How long now 'til we get there?

01:18:08.497 --> 01:18:14.366
A week... thereabouts, maybe a month, hell, I don't know.

01:18:16.055 --> 01:18:20.409
It's almost over now. We stay in
Iowa or come back to the territory?

01:18:20.434 --> 01:18:21.387
I don't know.

01:18:22.269 --> 01:18:26.710
- You're not much for makin' plans.
- No, not much.

01:18:28.901 --> 01:18:32.613
Mr. Briggs, you're an intelligent man.

01:18:33.114 --> 01:18:37.566
<i>And if you think on it,
I'm</i> sure you will see the wisdom in it.

01:18:37.666 --> 01:18:39.975
After we've turned
them over to Mrs. Carter,

01:18:41.330 --> 01:18:43.703
why don't we marry and
come back together?

01:18:45.209 --> 01:18:48.980
<i>I'm 31 years old, if I'm
ever to marry, it better be soon, and</i>

01:18:49.005 --> 01:18:50.776
<i>you're not getting any younger.</i>

01:18:51.466 --> 01:18:53.645
You've seen my house and my stock.

01:18:54.052 --> 01:18:56.809
I've got two fine claims
and money in the bank...

01:18:57.347 --> 01:19:00.766
I'm in good health and
capable of child bearing...

01:19:01.518 --> 01:19:05.198
<i>I plan to buy shoats next spring
and</i> fatten 'em on corn...

01:19:05.698 --> 01:19:09.174
and come summer I'll
have 60 acres into wheat.

01:19:10.903 --> 01:19:13.742
I plan to put in pumpkins, too.

01:19:15.658 --> 01:19:17.878
We'd make a good team you and I.

01:19:18.869 --> 01:19:22.143
If we pull together, we're bound
to prosper, don't you agree?

01:19:22.748 --> 01:19:27.283
- No, I ain't no farmer.
<i>- Well you could try...</i> you could try.

01:19:27.378 --> 01:19:30.427
<i>I tried it one time with a
widow woman up</i> north of Wamego.

01:19:30.706 --> 01:19:34.818
Up and down them God dammed
rows daylight 'til dark.

01:19:34.843 --> 01:19:37.204
There's prettier things to look at
than the ass end of an Ox.

01:19:37.213 --> 01:19:39.625
One morning I just rode off.

01:19:41.392 --> 01:19:43.003
You deserted her.

01:19:43.277 --> 01:19:46.227
When I left I was sorry,
but I never did <i>look back.</i>

01:19:46.372 --> 01:19:48.190
I see.

01:19:48.567 --> 01:19:50.678
So you won't marry me?

01:19:51.861 --> 01:19:57.775
- No, I won't.
- I know, I'm plain as an old tin pail.

01:19:58.743 --> 01:20:02.352
But would you think about it from here to
Hebron and talk with me about it again?

01:20:03.039 --> 01:20:04.742
Talk's cheap.

01:20:06.210 --> 01:20:09.517
Mr. Briggs, perhaps you don't
realize what a grand thing

01:20:09.617 --> 01:20:12.549
you're doing taking these
poor helpless women home.

01:20:12.674 --> 01:20:16.638
If you don't, I assure you the
good Lord does and I do.

01:20:17.421 --> 01:20:21.035
This might be the finest,
most generous act of your life.

01:20:21.516 --> 01:20:23.894
It might be $300.

01:20:26.438 --> 01:20:30.498
- You won't marry me?
- No.

01:20:32.653 --> 01:20:35.192
Then I am plain.

01:20:37.241 --> 01:20:39.395
I wish you'd say
one kind word to me.

01:20:39.494 --> 01:20:40.175
<i>Like what?</i>

01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:43.013
That I'm a good woman,
<i>that I've helped you.</i>

01:20:43.038 --> 01:20:46.525
Fair enough, you're a damn good woman,
Cuddy, and you've helped me.

01:20:56.219 --> 01:20:58.534
I deserted from the Dragoons.

01:21:00.056 --> 01:21:06.499
That's right, Company C 1st U.S.,
Fort Kearney, stoled a horse and away I run.

01:21:08.774 --> 01:21:10.712
I ain't attached to nothin',

01:21:12.778 --> 01:21:14.225
Just me.

01:21:34.346 --> 01:21:35.517
No.

01:21:36.018 --> 01:21:40.362
- I want to lie with you.
<i>- No.</i>

01:21:41.390 --> 01:21:46.252
-You must, I saved your life.
- No.

01:21:56.906 --> 01:22:00.775
Please, spare me my dignity, Sir.

01:22:42.570 --> 01:22:44.607
Raise your knees.

01:22:49.377 --> 01:22:51.301
Take me in your hand.

01:22:54.633 --> 01:22:57.130
Just you remember Cuddy,
I didn't force you.

01:22:57.844 --> 01:22:59.423
- I will.
- If I hurt you,

01:22:59.481 --> 01:23:01.349
- I can't help it.
- I know.

01:23:02.223 --> 01:23:05.045
- You asked me, I didn't ask you.
- I know.

01:23:05.727 --> 01:23:09.770
- So let me in you.
- Yes.

01:23:53.184 --> 01:23:54.661
Cuddy?

01:23:58.731 --> 01:24:00.117
Cuddy!

01:25:05.016 --> 01:25:08.899
My God in Heaven, Cuddy, we made a deal
to carry these women back to Iowa,

01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:12.291
and I kept my word and here
you done and broke yours.

01:25:34.087 --> 01:25:37.983
See here? You see what you've done?
You killed her.

01:25:38.008 --> 01:25:40.188
Look at her! You killed her!

01:25:40.836 --> 01:25:44.201
You're too damned crazy to pay attention
to anything, you God damned lunatics!

01:25:45.183 --> 01:25:47.430
You don't know nothing about this world.

01:25:48.811 --> 01:25:50.446
Can't even piss straight.

01:25:53.942 --> 01:25:56.189
Hadn't been for you,
Mary Bee wouldn't be dead.

01:25:58.362 --> 01:26:00.722
She wouldn't even be out here!

01:26:01.866 --> 01:26:06.622
If you hadn't gone crazy,
she wouldn't've made this trip.

01:26:06.822 --> 01:26:10.517
If you'd stayed steady and
strong, she'd be alive,

01:26:10.542 --> 01:26:12.868
and at home,
in her own house.

01:26:13.086 --> 01:26:16.072
And so would you, but no,
you went crazy...

01:26:16.273 --> 01:26:19.911
and drove her crazy and it killed her,
what do you got to say about that?

01:26:23.523 --> 01:26:25.004
Da.

01:26:59.092 --> 01:27:00.925
Well, I'll be.

01:27:22.658 --> 01:27:24.614
I'm goin' on by myself.

01:27:26.495 --> 01:27:28.704
<i>You're on your own.</i>

01:27:29.498 --> 01:27:33.427
Far enough along near East where
somebody'll come along and tend to you.

01:27:35.746 --> 01:27:39.909
There ain't a damn one of ya
can understand a word I'm saying.

01:28:21.426 --> 01:28:23.381
Oh, my God.

01:30:49.286 --> 01:30:50.484
How do?

01:30:50.746 --> 01:30:54.138
Been carryin' three women outside, hadn't
had anything to eat for three days.

01:30:54.238 --> 01:30:57.069
They need supper now, rooms for
the night and a hot baths.

01:30:57.194 --> 01:30:59.046
We're fill up.

01:31:01.382 --> 01:31:04.572
- With what?
- People.

01:31:06.554 --> 01:31:09.931
Mister I didn't come in here
for trouble, but I am tired.

01:31:10.767 --> 01:31:12.657
When I'm tired I'm easy to aggravate.

01:31:12.894 --> 01:31:15.521
Now this is a hotel, I've got money,

01:31:15.813 --> 01:31:18.639
I want supper now, then I
want a room for myself,

01:31:18.839 --> 01:31:20.361
<i>then I want the room for three women,</i>

01:31:20.394 --> 01:31:23.412
<i>and I want four</i> baths
or the reason why not.

01:31:24.406 --> 01:31:25.995
Wait here a minute.

01:31:47.388 --> 01:31:49.056
- Greetings!
- How do?

01:31:50.441 --> 01:31:52.307
My name is Aloysius Duffy,

01:31:52.329 --> 01:31:54.626
- and yours is?
- Briggs.

01:31:54.726 --> 01:31:58.249
I understand you're in need of a meal
and accommodations, Mr. Briggs.

01:31:58.274 --> 01:32:01.013
That's right, for myself
and 3 passengers, women.

01:32:01.122 --> 01:32:05.004
Oh, what an unusual cargo, I must say.

01:32:05.356 --> 01:32:09.298
In any case, Mr. Briggs,
I regret I cannot oblige you.

01:32:09.498 --> 01:32:13.572
- Why not, this is a hotel, ain't it?
- Have a drink on the house.

01:32:20.422 --> 01:32:21.563
Grant.

01:32:25.302 --> 01:32:26.255
There she went.

01:32:27.596 --> 01:32:31.762
Now then, Mr. Briggs, you couldn'ta
shown up at a more inauspicious time.

01:32:31.821 --> 01:32:39.060
It so happens a party of 16 potential investors
is coming from St. Louis by steamboat and coach.

01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:42.471
I trust you recognize, we cannot
accommodate anyone else.

01:32:43.904 --> 01:32:48.536
<i>These are gentlemen of means and the fate of
our</i> entire venture may very well depend on...

01:32:48.567 --> 01:32:52.793
We had a bad winter,
traveled a long way to get here.

01:32:53.005 --> 01:32:55.692
And they ain't had
nothin' to eat for 3 days.

01:32:57.460 --> 01:32:58.546
I'm sorry.

01:32:58.746 --> 01:33:04.503
The women are in bad shape,
they're... awful hungry.

01:33:07.137 --> 01:33:08.668
Let me see them.

01:33:29.901 --> 01:33:31.514
Good God.

01:33:31.778 --> 01:33:35.951
- You can't turn us away.
- I can't.

01:33:47.136 --> 01:33:51.433
Mr. Briggs, those women
are pitiful, I concede.

01:33:51.565 --> 01:33:56.333
But we can't have 'em here tonight,
<i>the milk of human kindness be damned.</i>

01:33:56.813 --> 01:34:01.167
Now, kindly, be out the door and
take that wagon away from here.

01:34:01.367 --> 01:34:03.170
And God speed to ya.

01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:07.401
<i>The shoe's on the other</i> foot now,
you put them guns down on the floor

01:34:07.414 --> 01:34:11.977
real careful and get us our <i>supper
on the table right</i> God damned now.

01:34:14.864 --> 01:34:17.831
Shoe's back where it belongs, Mr. Briggs.

01:34:19.752 --> 01:34:22.129
Grant, well done.

01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:24.271
Be on your way, my friend.

01:34:24.416 --> 01:34:27.945
And lament your neglect
at my offering a whiskey.

01:34:27.970 --> 01:34:29.929
Why? And I'll tell you why...

01:34:29.988 --> 01:34:34.025
you are the worst bunch of lyin', thievin',
pissant sons of bitches I'll ever run into.

01:34:36.103 --> 01:34:39.776
You turn your back on these poor women you'll
answer for it for the rest of your lives.

01:34:40.616 --> 01:34:45.087
You won't sleep, <i>you'll choke on
your whiskey and on your water.</i>

01:34:45.571 --> 01:34:51.072
The food you eat will block up your bowels,
you'll die of your own shit.

01:34:51.535 --> 01:34:53.621
<i>Your mothers and your sisters,</i>

01:34:53.721 --> 01:34:59.001
and your wives and your daughters
will curse your broke dicks old.

01:35:00.836 --> 01:35:08.405
Get on! Get on! Hyah! Hyah!
Get on! Get on! Get! Go on!

01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:11.983
<i>Get on! Get on! Get on!</i>

01:35:14.392 --> 01:35:16.014
Oh, for God's sake.
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

01:35:16.715 --> 01:35:17.729
Come on! Jaw!

01:35:20.846 --> 01:35:23.091
<i>Get on there, mule! Go on!</i>

01:35:24.893 --> 01:35:26.136
Get on!

01:35:31.549 --> 01:35:32.850
<i>Get on!</i>

01:35:56.393 --> 01:35:58.435
I'm gonna go get us somethin' to eat.

01:35:59.021 --> 01:36:03.246
Now you all be good girls and go to sleep,
I'll be back directly.

01:36:51.742 --> 01:36:53.488
You need to get on outta here.

01:37:03.462 --> 01:37:04.920
Don't look back, daughter.

01:37:36.872 --> 01:37:38.166
Son of a bitch!

01:37:40.633 --> 01:37:42.311
God damn that hurts!

01:37:47.257 --> 01:37:49.042
Ah, shite!

01:40:44.857 --> 01:40:47.254
She looks ridiculous, with...

01:40:48.861 --> 01:40:51.720
Pardon, Ma'am, I'm looking
for a woman by the name of Altha Carter,

01:40:51.814 --> 01:40:53.671
do you know where her house is at?

01:40:54.074 --> 01:40:57.240
- That would be the Minister's wife?
- Yes, Ma'am, that's right, it would be.

01:40:58.328 --> 01:40:59.756
Go on down to the Methodist church.

01:40:59.856 --> 01:41:02.953
The house across the street,
<i>that's the parsonage.</i>

01:41:04.001 --> 01:41:06.585
All right, Ma'am, thank you.

01:41:06.795 --> 01:41:08.430
Come, Maisy, don't look at him.

01:42:04.229 --> 01:42:04.730
Sir?

01:42:06.941 --> 01:42:11.179
Afternoon, Ma'am, are you Mrs. Altha Carter,
the wife of the Methodist Minister?

01:42:11.279 --> 01:42:14.541
- I am.
- Well, Ma'am, my name is Briggs.

01:42:14.641 --> 01:42:19.220
I'm from the Territories, Loup,
and I've brought you 3 women.

01:42:20.062 --> 01:42:21.399
Women?

01:42:23.573 --> 01:42:25.019
Oh.

01:42:25.893 --> 01:42:29.010
Oh, for goodness sakes, yes!

01:42:30.665 --> 01:42:33.365
You have been a long
time coming, Mr. Briggs,

01:42:33.565 --> 01:42:35.284
I am relieved you're here.

01:42:35.384 --> 01:42:37.703
I'm... I'm sorry Reverend Carter isn't.

01:42:37.823 --> 01:42:41.502
He is out burying a beloved
member of our congregation.

01:42:43.311 --> 01:42:47.296
Just a minute, I thought a woman
named Cuddy was bringing them.

01:42:47.396 --> 01:42:49.212
That's what Reverend Dowd wrote.

01:42:49.443 --> 01:42:51.587
She was with us up to a week ago, Ma'am.

01:42:51.612 --> 01:42:54.599
I'm sorry to tell you
that a fever took her.

01:42:55.491 --> 01:42:57.738
<i>I buried her and we moved on.</i>

01:42:58.502 --> 01:43:02.243
Mary Bee Cuddy... was her name.

01:43:05.008 --> 01:43:08.230
Oh, what a... terrible loss.

01:43:08.429 --> 01:43:11.285
She must have been a fine,
brave <i>human being.</i>

01:43:11.590 --> 01:43:13.551
She truly was.

01:43:15.719 --> 01:43:19.559
They've ridden all this way...
in that box?

01:43:21.408 --> 01:43:22.865
Oh, Mercy!

01:43:26.396 --> 01:43:29.431
Well...it's time to meet them.

01:43:31.986 --> 01:43:33.602
I'm not sure I'm ready.

01:43:42.111 --> 01:43:43.087
Get over there.

01:43:57.980 --> 01:44:02.372
- You must have had an awful winter.
- We did, Ma'am.

01:44:27.185 --> 01:44:30.044
Put them on the settee, Mr. Briggs.

01:44:38.262 --> 01:44:40.598
- Do they speak?
- No.

01:44:48.898 --> 01:44:52.947
- Do they understand anything?
- Ma'am, I don't know.

01:44:57.407 --> 01:45:01.018
I noticed their eyes move 'round
the room, what does that mean?

01:45:02.787 --> 01:45:04.517
That's hard to tell.

01:45:05.875 --> 01:45:11.711
Perhaps each remembers
a parlor... from her own past.

01:45:12.172 --> 01:45:14.232
<i>Poor, poor dears.</i>

01:45:15.509 --> 01:45:18.598
Have you noticed any
improvement in their condition?

01:45:18.698 --> 01:45:21.666
They don't scrap with each other
and try to run off anymore.

01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:23.975
Tell me their names.

01:45:24.294 --> 01:45:26.981
- This Theoline Belknap, she killed her baby.
- Oh, no, no, no!

01:45:27.355 --> 01:45:31.119
Please don't tell me, Mr. Briggs,
I don't care to know.

01:45:31.984 --> 01:45:34.987
That one there is a Norski woman
<i>by the name Gro Svendsen.</i>

01:45:35.446 --> 01:45:38.591
- Very well.
- And that's Arabella Sours.

01:45:38.616 --> 01:45:41.415
<i>She's only a girl, why,</i>
she even have a doll.

01:45:41.419 --> 01:45:45.161
She had 3 little children, lost 'em
all to the diphtheria in 3 days.

01:45:45.673 --> 01:45:49.494
Dear Lord!
Please don't say anymore.

01:45:51.246 --> 01:45:56.488
There's letters on all 3 of 'em in this
bag here, about their kin folks and all.

01:45:57.343 --> 01:45:59.216
I better move on.

01:46:01.139 --> 01:46:04.123
They might just jump
up and try t'follow me.

01:46:05.352 --> 01:46:07.552
I think this room will hold them.

01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:10.536
Oh! I almost forgot.

01:46:16.113 --> 01:46:18.537
This is for you, Miss Sours.

01:46:19.658 --> 01:46:21.314
It's lovely.

01:46:21.786 --> 01:46:26.804
Maybe you'll want it...
one fine day.

01:46:34.732 --> 01:46:37.744
Well, goodbye, ladies.

01:46:40.630 --> 01:46:42.380
God bless you.

01:46:59.825 --> 01:47:02.940
They'll be all right.
I want to say goodbye to you.

01:47:03.328 --> 01:47:05.286
You can give this wagon and those mules

01:47:05.881 --> 01:47:08.688
and that plaid horse and everything
else to the Methodist Women.

01:47:08.888 --> 01:47:13.622
Maybe they can sell everything, use the money
to pay for railroad fare and whatever else.

01:47:14.673 --> 01:47:20.504
Mr. Briggs! I'm delighted!
How very generous of you.

01:47:20.513 --> 01:47:23.577
Tell the Reverend to give
those mules a good feeding of corn.

01:47:23.807 --> 01:47:26.677
- Will you go back to the Territory?
- I don't know.

01:47:26.894 --> 01:47:30.933
If you do, please thank Reverend
Dowd for me and wish him well.

01:47:31.033 --> 01:47:32.904
Yes, Ma'am.

01:47:33.526 --> 01:47:38.326
Well then... this is our goodbye,
Mr. Briggs, give me your hand.

01:47:39.783 --> 01:47:43.959
God Our Father, bless this
good man, wherever he may go.

01:47:44.059 --> 01:47:45.513
Keep watch over him.

01:47:45.872 --> 01:47:48.244
Cause thy face to shine upon him,

01:47:48.332 --> 01:47:51.193
and bring him home to Thee one day.

01:47:51.836 --> 01:47:54.107
In Jesus' name I pray, amen.

01:47:55.715 --> 01:47:59.488
I hope we meet again, Mr. Briggs, goodbye.

01:48:01.930 --> 01:48:03.604
You can go on now.

01:48:51.773 --> 01:48:54.757
Oh, yes, Sir.
Looks better, Sir.

01:49:17.624 --> 01:49:20.711
- How old are you?
- Sixteen.

01:49:21.262 --> 01:49:23.426
You ain't got no shoes or nothin' on your feet.

01:49:24.048 --> 01:49:26.455
Well, that's my business ain't it?

01:49:45.312 --> 01:49:47.904
I'll take them shoes, right there.

01:50:23.967 --> 01:50:27.364
You're playing high stakes, Sir,
can you show $50?

01:50:27.463 --> 01:50:30.187
There's $300... for ya.

01:50:30.999 --> 01:50:33.691
- Mind if I have a look?
- Suit yourself.

01:50:39.843 --> 01:50:41.759
Have a look at this, Mr. Carmichael.

01:50:51.354 --> 01:50:54.530
Bank of Loup, up near Wamego.

01:50:54.733 --> 01:50:56.595
How long since you've been there, Sir?

01:50:56.795 --> 01:50:58.293
Five... six weeks.

01:50:58.528 --> 01:51:00.008
Bank of Loup went bust.

01:51:00.208 --> 01:51:04.038
Happens all the time to
sod-buster banks in the Territory.

01:51:04.534 --> 01:51:08.128
I've lost more than my fair
share of this wild-cat paper.

01:51:08.955 --> 01:51:10.794
You have any greenbacks?

01:51:10.915 --> 01:51:13.871
No, I spent it all.

01:51:14.628 --> 01:51:18.343
I'm sorry, Sir, I cannot
accept these banknotes.

01:51:18.543 --> 01:51:20.593
Nobody around here will.

01:51:21.218 --> 01:51:23.916
Sorry, but you can't sit at the
table unless you're playin'.

01:51:24.221 --> 01:51:27.176
- I have to ask you to leave.
- What?

01:51:28.809 --> 01:51:30.779
Please leave the table, Sir.

01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:37.521
You are not socially acceptable here, see?

01:51:55.378 --> 01:51:58.032
You ever know a woman by
the name Mary Bee Cuddy?

01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:00.005
No, Sir.

01:52:00.759 --> 01:52:01.984
These are for you.

01:52:11.395 --> 01:52:12.792
You still gotta pay your bill.

01:52:12.821 --> 01:52:16.609
That gravy and them biscuits you
made was pretty good.

01:52:16.692 --> 01:52:17.847
Thank you.

01:52:18.402 --> 01:52:20.679
I gotta good piece of advice for you.

01:52:22.656 --> 01:52:25.273
When you get grown,
don't marry some shitty old kid

01:52:25.373 --> 01:52:28.609
headed West to make a claim
on a farm he ain't built yet.

01:52:28.709 --> 01:52:31.989
Don't do that, you stay here.

01:52:32.039 --> 01:52:35.510
- Why?
- Because I told you to.

01:52:36.087 --> 01:52:39.287
- Who is Mary Bee Cuddy?
- Mary Bee Cuddy...

01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:43.356
was just a fine a woman as ever walked.

01:52:46.305 --> 01:52:49.983
- You'll never know her.
- Well, then, so what?

01:52:50.183 --> 01:52:51.519
So what?

01:52:54.356 --> 01:53:01.221
You are the living, breathing reason
she will never be lost.

01:53:03.156 --> 01:53:06.285
That's "what", darlin'.

01:53:06.826 --> 01:53:10.096
- You're a strange man.
- Well, I expect I am.

01:53:12.332 --> 01:53:14.158
Why don't we marry?

01:53:16.211 --> 01:53:18.447
Maybe.

01:53:51.965 --> 01:53:53.426
Haul away!

01:54:17.013 --> 01:54:18.816
<i>Pull up them shorelines!</i>

01:54:29.067 --> 01:54:31.852
<i>- Yeah, I'm good when your are.
- Shove off!</i>

01:54:37.908 --> 01:54:39.964
<i>Hang on, by the left.</i>

01:54:41.447 --> 01:54:44.016
<i>- Hang on, walk it down, walk it down.
- I got it.</i>

01:54:46.284 --> 01:54:49.201
<i>- All right, we're movin'.
- I see... take it down, boys, take it down.</i>

01:54:50.054 --> 01:54:52.245
<i>- Let 'er catch up.
- Lead it out.</i>

01:55:02.403 --> 01:55:06.152
♫ Take her by her lily white hand, ♫

01:55:06.532 --> 01:55:09.712
♫ Lead her like a pigeon. ♫

01:55:10.253 --> 01:55:14.955
♫ Make her dance the Weevily Wheat,
scatter her religion. ♫

01:55:15.055 --> 01:55:16.282
You boys know the Weevily Wheat?

01:55:16.383 --> 01:55:17.714
- Hell, yeah.
<i>- Get on up here</i>

01:55:20.714 --> 01:55:25.237
♫ Oh, Charley, he's a fine man,
Charley, he's a dandy. ♫

01:55:25.277 --> 01:55:30.294
♫ Every time he goes to town,
he brings his gal some candy. ♫

01:55:37.031 --> 01:55:40.892
<i>Hush up that noise,
there's people here trying to sleep!</i>

01:55:43.988 --> 01:55:45.857
You sons of bitches!

01:55:46.157 --> 01:55:49.133
We are headed West, God damn it!

01:55:49.527 --> 01:55:52.761
You've been hiring them
for God damned Navy.

01:55:54.791 --> 01:55:59.242
♫ Oh, Charley, he's a fine man,
Charley, he's a dandy. ♫

01:55:59.254 --> 01:56:04.303
♫ Every time he goes to town,
he brings his gal some candy. ♫

01:56:05.968 --> 01:56:09.915
<i>♫ Charley here and Charley there,
Charley over the ocean. ♫</i>

01:56:10.016 --> 01:56:14.683
<i>♫ Charley'd never pass a train
...if he don't see motion. ♫</i>

01:56:34.931 --> 01:56:36.621
Clap your hands.
