Uh, why do they have

"World," "The Arts,"

A-ha! Here it is.

"Kickin' Back!"

00:40.540 --> 00:42.542
Hey, who cut something
out of my paper?

00:42.625 --> 00:43.960
Not me.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.628
Not me. I'm more
of a mail-tamperer.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.338
Well, don't look at me,

00:47.422 --> 00:48.506
just because I'm holding
a pair of scissors.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.844
Scissors, which I need
to, uh, to...

00:52.927 --> 00:55.555
gussy up these curtains.

Hello.

01:00.435 --> 01:01.895
Oh, hi, Lenny.

01:01.978 --> 01:04.689
No, why would I need
a ride this afternoon?

(noisy vacuuming)

01:06.983 --> 01:09.069
Where?!

01:09.152 --> 01:11.529
To the big annual what?!

01:12.906 --> 01:15.033
Lenny? Aw, well,
if it was big and annual

01:15.116 --> 01:18.036
I'm sure they'd have
mentioned it in the newspaper.

01:18.119 --> 01:19.746
(dog growling)

01:19.829 --> 01:24.501
Yeah, it's a lazy,
dog-dangling afternoon.

01:24.584 --> 01:28.046
But something's
a little off.

01:28.129 --> 01:30.090
Hey, Marge, you don't smoke.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.509
Well, I just felt
like filling the house

01:32.592 --> 01:35.512
with the rich,
satisfying smell of tobacco.

01:35.595 --> 01:36.513
(coughs)

01:37.680 --> 01:38.640
(whistles)

01:38.723 --> 01:40.058
You're nuts.

01:40.141 --> 01:41.184
I got to get some fresh air.

01:43.186 --> 01:44.938
-No, Homie, wait.
-What's wrong with you?

01:45.021 --> 01:46.856
What are you trying
to hide from me?

01:46.940 --> 01:48.566
(sniffing)
What's that smell?

01:48.650 --> 01:53.113
Onions... chili powder...
cumin... juicy ground chuck!

01:53.196 --> 01:54.864
It's chili! Oh, my God!

01:54.948 --> 01:56.616
I'm missing the chili cook-off!

01:56.699 --> 01:58.493
I'm missing the cook-off.

01:58.576 --> 02:00.203
It's going on right now
and I'm missing it.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.664
All right, I was trying
to keep it from you,

02:02.747 --> 02:05.083
but I had a good reason.

02:05.166 --> 02:06.501
Every time you go
to that cook-off

02:06.584 --> 02:08.211
you get drunk
as a poet on payday.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.546
Remember last year?

02:10.922 --> 02:12.841
Look at me.

02:12.924 --> 02:16.803
I'm a puffy pink cloud.

Oh, well, of course

02:21.933 --> 02:24.644
everything looks bad
if you remember it.

02:24.727 --> 02:26.771
Now, where are
my chili boots?

02:26.855 --> 02:28.314
Ah!

02:28.398 --> 02:30.483
(grunting)

02:30.567 --> 02:33.486
Okay, we'll go
to the chili cook-off.

02:33.570 --> 02:36.072
But I want you to promise me
you won't have any beer.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.700
Okay, quit nagging me.
I won't have any beer.

02:38.783 --> 02:40.660
Geez, why don't you have
a cigarette or something?

02:40.743 --> 02:43.705
Mm, I suppose I could.

02:49.377 --> 02:51.880
I'm gonna go get
some vegetarian chili

02:51.963 --> 02:53.673
before they get desperate
and add meat.

02:53.756 --> 02:54.883
I'm gonna go
claim some valuables

02:54.966 --> 02:56.259

02:56.342 --> 02:59.554
Ooh, look at that
adorable spice rack.

02:59.637 --> 03:01.514
Eight spices?

03:01.598 --> 03:03.516
Oh, some must be doubles.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.935
"Oregano"?
What the hell...

03:06.019 --> 03:08.730
Marge, we're
missing the chili.

03:08.813 --> 03:10.773
Less artsy, more fartsy.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.775
Homer, I happen
to like handicrafts

03:12.859 --> 03:14.903

stuffing my face.

03:14.986 --> 03:16.613
Fine. I'll come find you

03:16.696 --> 03:18.573

Five-alarm chili, eh?

04:32.522 --> 04:34.023
Oh, I admit it.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.859
It's only two-alarm,
two-and-a-half, tops.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.862
I just wanted to be a big man
in front of the kids.

04:39.946 --> 04:42.615
Daddy, are you
going to jail?

04:42.699 --> 04:45.201

We'll see.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.749
Evenin', little lady.

Wait, Mister.
You're drinking a candle.

06:40.691 --> 06:43.903

in your mouth, do you?

06:43.986 --> 06:45.988

06:46.072 --> 06:48.741
Maybe I do.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.162

06:53.246 --> 06:54.997
Outstanding.

look who's back.

06:58.960 --> 07:02.422

Oh, this porridge is too hot.

Oh, waa-waa-waa!

07:05.716 --> 07:07.093
(laughing)

07:07.176 --> 07:08.594
Want some more, do you?

07:08.678 --> 07:10.972
Well, sure.
Heck, it's not my job

07:11.055 --> 07:13.141

killing themselves.

07:13.224 --> 07:16.060

this can't be happening.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.240
By all medical logic

07:29.323 --> 07:31.242
steam should be shooting
out of his ears.

07:31.325 --> 07:32.535
His ears if we're lucky.

07:35.079 --> 07:39.792
Well, Chief,
don't quit your day job--

Okay, retrace your steps.

Woke up,
fought with Marge,

09:01.749 --> 09:04.418
ate Guatemalan
insanity peppers.

09:04.502 --> 09:08.047

09:15.346 --> 09:17.807
I hope I didn't brain my damage.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.684
I better check my pupils.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.610
(hissing)

09:30.653 --> 09:34.073
Oh... kay.

09:34.156 --> 09:37.201
I think I'm gonna be
leaving now.

09:42.665 --> 09:44.125
Huh?

Stop doing anything.

10:04.103 --> 10:06.606
Has anyone seen Homer?

10:06.689 --> 10:08.190
Marge, better
you hear it from me

10:08.274 --> 10:09.942
than some gossipy neighbor.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.944
Homer made a total
jackass of himself.

10:12.028 --> 10:14.780
Oh, Helen, that's enough.
Call off your dogs.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.741
But someone had
to tell her.

10:16.824 --> 10:18.117
And I got here first.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.703
-Helen, zip it.
-Oh please. Tim.

10:20.786 --> 10:22.955
Zip it. Ziparoo.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.248
No beer, huh?

10:24.332 --> 10:25.958
(grumbling)

10:26.042 --> 10:29.837
I guess I know what a promise
from Homer J. Simpson is worth.

10:35.843 --> 10:38.638
Hey, buddy, get back there
with the other rocks.

10:39.972 --> 10:41.098
Huh?

10:41.182 --> 10:42.808
A tortoise?

10:42.892 --> 10:45.186
"Follow... the..."

10:45.269 --> 10:47.355
(gasps)
This must be why I'm here!

10:47.438 --> 10:49.398
Follow the what?
Follow the what?

10:49.482 --> 10:51.400
Hurry up!

10:54.487 --> 10:55.988
Get moving you stupid--

10:56.072 --> 10:59.867
When I'm kicking you,
that means hurry up.

10:59.950 --> 11:01.952
Come on.

11:15.132 --> 11:17.051
Oh, you want me
to climb that, huh?

11:17.134 --> 11:19.136
No problemo.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.097
(rumbling)

11:23.099 --> 11:24.725
Oh!

11:24.809 --> 11:26.811
This is 'cause I kicked you,
isn't it?

11:29.355 --> 11:30.523
(grunting)

11:32.525 --> 11:33.984
Lis, check it out.

11:35.152 --> 11:36.320
I saw it, Bart.

11:36.404 --> 11:37.863
You're just mad

11:37.947 --> 11:38.906
'cause there's
no clock in your hat.

11:38.989 --> 11:40.491
What hat?

11:40.574 --> 11:43.285
Ah, this baby's wasted
on an idiot like you.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.912
Where's Homer?

11:44.995 --> 11:46.372
Your father decided
that he'd rather come home

11:46.455 --> 11:49.375
in a taxi... or a police car.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.299
Marge, thank God
you're here.

11:57.383 --> 11:58.467
Where's the car?

11:58.551 --> 12:01.971
Marge? Marge?

12:02.054 --> 12:03.639
Oh, now what?

12:03.723 --> 12:07.143
If you're still mad at me,
I'm gonna be really mad.

12:07.226 --> 12:08.644
Come on, Marge,
will you..?

12:08.728 --> 12:11.480
Fight fair.
I never do this to you.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.107
Talk to me!

12:13.190 --> 12:16.068
(wind blowing)

12:20.531 --> 12:23.826
Oh, I hate this place.

12:23.909 --> 12:25.745
Why am I here?

12:25.828 --> 12:28.205
VOICE: <i>You are on</i>
<i>a quest for knowledge.</i>

12:28.289 --> 12:29.165
Who said that?

12:39.049 --> 12:40.468
Fear not, Homer.

12:40.551 --> 12:42.136
I am your spirit guide.

12:42.219 --> 12:43.304
Hiya.

12:43.387 --> 12:45.306
There is a lesson
you must learn.

12:45.389 --> 12:47.725
If it's about laying off
the insanity peppers

12:47.808 --> 12:48.768
I'm way ahead of you.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.020
No, I speak of a deeper wisdom.

12:51.103 --> 12:53.022
The problem, Homer,

12:53.105 --> 12:55.357
is that the mind is
always chattering away

12:55.441 --> 12:57.651
with a thousand thoughts
at once.

12:57.735 --> 12:59.862
Yeah, that's me all right.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.822
(wind blowing)

13:03.324 --> 13:06.160
Clarity is the path
to inner peace.

13:06.243 --> 13:08.454
Well, what should I do?
Should I meditate?

13:08.537 --> 13:10.748
Should I get rid
of all my possessions?

13:10.831 --> 13:13.125
Are you kidding?!
(chuckles)

13:13.209 --> 13:15.503
If anything, you should
get more possessions.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.296
You don't even have
a computer.

13:17.379 --> 13:20.925
You know, I have been meaning
to take a spiritual journey

13:21.008 --> 13:22.301
and I--

13:22.384 --> 13:23.719
(growling)

13:23.803 --> 13:25.679
Hey, knock it off!

13:25.763 --> 13:27.598
Sorry.

13:27.681 --> 13:29.350
I am a coyote.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.018
Look, just give me
some inner peace

13:31.101 --> 13:32.520
or I'll mop the floor
with you.

13:32.603 --> 13:35.564
Good. Your mind is in
a state of readiness.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.316
So listen well.

13:37.399 --> 13:39.819
To make yourself complete,

13:39.902 --> 13:41.487
you must find your soul mate.

13:41.570 --> 13:42.988
Soul mate?

13:43.072 --> 13:45.241
Your kindred spirit.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.701
The one with whom you share
an unspoken bond,

13:47.785 --> 13:50.496
a profound mystical
understanding.

13:50.579 --> 13:52.414
That's it?

13:52.498 --> 13:54.333
Well, that's Marge.
Big deal.

13:54.416 --> 13:57.169
Great spiritual quest,
Wolfie.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.505
My soul mate is Marge.

13:59.588 --> 14:01.257
Is it?

14:07.388 --> 14:09.807
Hey wait. Come back.

14:09.890 --> 14:11.058
Oh.

14:11.141 --> 14:12.852
(horn blowing)

14:12.935 --> 14:14.270
Oh! A ghost train!

14:14.353 --> 14:16.397
And so little time
to get out of the way.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.439
Now less...

14:17.523 --> 14:19.108
Now none!
(screams)

14:19.191 --> 14:20.442
D'oh!

14:21.652 --> 14:24.655
Hey, get off the course,
you bum!

14:24.738 --> 14:26.156
Security.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.533
(whistle blowing)

14:27.616 --> 14:30.119
Wha-- Golf course?

14:30.202 --> 14:32.746
Did I dream that whole thing?

14:32.830 --> 14:35.833
Maybe the desert
was just a sand trap.

14:35.916 --> 14:37.293
Oh, and I bet

14:37.376 --> 14:40.963
that crazy pyramid
was just the Pro Shop.

14:41.046 --> 14:44.174
And that talking coyote
was really just a talking dog.

14:44.258 --> 14:45.634
Hi, Homer.
Find your soul mate.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.136
Hey, wait a minute.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.430
There's no such thing
as a talking dog.

14:49.513 --> 14:50.848
(barking)

14:50.931 --> 14:52.266
Damn straight.

14:52.349 --> 14:54.059
So then I says to Mabel,
I says--

14:54.143 --> 14:55.227
Hi, kids.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.478
I'll finish this later.
Hi Dad.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.731
-Where is your mother?
-Out back.

14:58.814 --> 15:00.900
So anyway,
I says to Mabel, I says--

15:00.983 --> 15:02.026
Hi, honey.

15:03.611 --> 15:06.947
(singsongy)
Oh, I guess you're cranky

15:07.031 --> 15:09.450
because I didn't
come home last night.

15:09.533 --> 15:12.453
I'm "cranky" because
my husband got drunk

15:12.536 --> 15:15.414
and humiliated me
in front of the entire town.

15:15.497 --> 15:18.334
You broke
your promise, Homer.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.419
Oh, honey,
I didn't get drunk.

15:20.502 --> 15:23.047
I just went to a strange
fantasy world.

15:23.130 --> 15:24.965
Come on, you got
to believe me.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.216
You're my soul mate.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.260
Don't "soul mate" me!

15:28.344 --> 15:29.887
Okay.

15:29.970 --> 15:31.889
(snoring)

15:31.972 --> 15:35.684
That coyote said my soul mate
would understand me

15:35.768 --> 15:38.145
but Marge doesn't understand me
at all.

15:38.228 --> 15:39.855
Maybe we're not kindred spirits.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.859
We don't have
anything in common.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.487
Look at these records.

15:46.570 --> 15:49.657
Jim Nabors, Glen Campbell,
The Doodletown Pipers.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.533
Now look at her records.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.452
They stink!

15:53.535 --> 15:57.039
Oh. Maybe I had
that crazy dream for a reason.

15:59.375 --> 16:03.170
Wherever my soul mate is,
it's not here.

16:11.845 --> 16:14.723
I always just figured
my wife was my soul mate,

16:14.807 --> 16:17.351
but if it's not Marge,
then who is it?

16:17.434 --> 16:19.061
Where do I begin looking?

16:19.144 --> 16:20.729
This really goes
beyond my training

16:20.813 --> 16:22.564
as a furniture
salesman, sir.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.149
Now, if you
don't want the sofa

16:24.233 --> 16:25.609
I'll have to ask you
to leave.

16:28.278 --> 16:32.157
Hey, Barney, soul mate,
let me buy you a beer.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.410
Okay, but I'm not
your soul mate.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.328
I'm really more
of a chum.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.288
-What about you, Lenny?
-I'm a crony.

16:38.372 --> 16:39.873
-Carl?
-I'd say acquaintance.

16:39.957 --> 16:41.500
-Colleague.
-Sympathizer.

16:41.583 --> 16:42.543
-Compadre.
-Associate.

16:42.626 --> 16:43.711
Contemporary.

16:43.794 --> 16:45.129
I'm a well-wisher

16:45.212 --> 16:47.881
in that I don't wish you
any specific harm.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.591
(sighs)

16:51.427 --> 16:53.512
Hello? Is this, uh...

16:53.595 --> 16:54.847
G.B.M.?

16:54.930 --> 16:57.891
Uh, yeah.
I read in the personals

16:57.975 --> 16:59.518
you were seeking a soul mate.

16:59.601 --> 17:02.563
Well, I also like
rainy days and movies.

17:02.646 --> 17:04.565
Uh-huh.

17:04.648 --> 17:09.778
Uh... no...
I don't like that...

17:09.862 --> 17:11.572
or that.

17:11.655 --> 17:12.906
No, it's not that I'm afraid.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.034
I'm gonna hang up now.
Bye-bye.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.744
Oh... I give up.

17:16.827 --> 17:19.121
COYOTE:

(sighs)

18:07.002 --> 18:08.003
Huh?

18:08.087 --> 18:10.214
What's that blinking light?

18:10.297 --> 18:11.465
(gasps)

18:11.548 --> 18:13.092
The lighthouse keeper.

18:13.175 --> 18:16.345
The loneliest man in the world.

18:16.428 --> 18:17.846
He'll understand me.

18:22.518 --> 18:23.435
(panting)

18:26.563 --> 18:27.606
Earl.

18:27.689 --> 18:29.650
My new friend's name is Earl.

18:29.733 --> 18:31.610
Here I come, buddy!

18:31.693 --> 18:34.321
No more loneliness
for Homer and Earl.

18:37.908 --> 18:39.868
A machine?

18:39.952 --> 18:42.246
Earl's a machine?

18:42.329 --> 18:45.624
Oh, that's just perfect.

18:45.707 --> 18:49.253
Homer's desperate search
for a soul mate has yielded

18:49.336 --> 18:51.505
a lighthouse-keeping robot.

18:51.588 --> 18:53.132
Oh, wow.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.510
Hey, look, is that Dad?

18:56.593 --> 18:59.638
Either that or Batman's
really let himself go.

18:59.721 --> 19:01.515
Alone.

19:01.598 --> 19:03.100
Oh, I'm alone.

19:03.183 --> 19:05.310
I'm a lonely,
insignificant speck

19:05.394 --> 19:08.814
on a has-been planet orbited
by a cold, indifferent sun.

19:08.897 --> 19:10.232
(horn blows)

19:10.315 --> 19:12.192
A ship.

19:12.276 --> 19:13.652
A ship with people.

19:13.735 --> 19:15.654
I know.
I'll bring them to me.

19:15.737 --> 19:17.739
And then they'll
have to be my friends.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.702
Come here, people.

19:21.785 --> 19:23.829
(laughing)

19:25.581 --> 19:26.790
Arr, matey.

19:26.874 --> 19:29.293
Nary a warning
light to be seen.

19:29.376 --> 19:32.129
'Tis clear sailing ahead
for our precious cargo.

19:32.212 --> 19:34.756
Uh... would that be
the hot pants, sir?

19:34.840 --> 19:36.508
Aye, the hot pants.

19:36.592 --> 19:37.759
(giggling)

19:37.843 --> 19:40.762
Well, I won't be lonely
for long.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.390
(giggling hysterically)

19:44.641 --> 19:47.728
(footsteps approaching)

19:47.811 --> 19:49.188
Huh? Who's there?

19:49.271 --> 19:52.524
Oh, Homer, thank
goodness you're safe.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.109
-Marge?
-I woke up,

19:54.193 --> 19:56.320
and you weren't there,
and I was so worried.

19:56.403 --> 19:57.905
Really? You were?

19:57.988 --> 20:00.282
But how did you find me?

20:00.365 --> 20:02.910
Well... I was sure
you'd be on foot

20:02.993 --> 20:04.244
because you always say

20:04.328 --> 20:06.747
public transportation
is for losers,

20:06.830 --> 20:08.665
and I was sure you'd head west

20:08.749 --> 20:11.627
because Springfield
slopes down that way,

20:11.710 --> 20:13.545
and then I saw the lighthouse,

20:13.629 --> 20:16.840
and I remembered
how you love blinking lights--

20:16.924 --> 20:18.926
like the one on
the waffle iron.

20:19.009 --> 20:22.137
Or that little guy on
the "don't walk" sign.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.764
-Yeah.
-Wow, Marge,

20:23.847 --> 20:25.599
you really
do understand me.

20:25.682 --> 20:27.768
See, I thought we weren't
soul mates because--

20:27.851 --> 20:29.019
We had a fight?

20:29.102 --> 20:30.854
Right, and we don't like
the same things.

20:30.938 --> 20:33.065
-It's like you're from Venus--
-And you're from Mars.

20:33.148 --> 20:35.859
Oh sure, give me the one
with all the monsters.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.861
Homer, don't you see?

20:37.945 --> 20:40.489
Our differences are
only skin deep.

20:40.572 --> 20:44.117
But our sames go
right down to the bone.

20:44.201 --> 20:45.494
Maybe we do have--

20:45.577 --> 20:48.330
A profound mystical
understanding?

20:48.413 --> 20:50.499
Hey. We do!

20:50.582 --> 20:52.960
Oh, Marge!

20:53.043 --> 20:55.712
We're number one!
We're number one!

20:55.796 --> 20:58.006
In your face, space coyote.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.299
Space coyote?

20:59.383 --> 21:01.051
-(horn blowing)
-Oh, my God!

21:01.134 --> 21:03.595
-The ship!
-We'll all be killed!

21:03.679 --> 21:04.846
The light.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.139
We got to get
the light back on.

21:14.147 --> 21:16.066
Jonathan Livingston
Seagull!

21:16.149 --> 21:17.567
We're on
a collision course!

21:17.651 --> 21:18.735
Hard a-starboard!

21:18.819 --> 21:19.820
Uh, port?

21:19.903 --> 21:21.697
Aye, port.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.782
They see us.

21:23.865 --> 21:26.243
They're starting
to turn.

21:26.326 --> 21:27.911
We did it.

21:27.995 --> 21:29.830
We sure did...

21:29.913 --> 21:31.790
soul mate.

21:31.873 --> 21:33.709
(moaning)

21:34.918 --> 21:36.086
(metal scraping)

21:39.381 --> 21:40.882

21:40.966 --> 21:42.509
(whistles)

21:42.592 --> 21:44.428
Look at all them hot pants.

21:44.511 --> 21:46.013
Hey, who likes short shorts?
