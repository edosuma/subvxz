10:04.111 --> 10:05.711
Somebody knows
how to make an entrance.

10:05.746 --> 10:06.945
Hello, all.

10:06.980 --> 10:08.080
What's up, girl? How you doing?

10:08.114 --> 10:10.019
Nice to see you again.
Great pants.

10:11.117 --> 10:13.318
Anyway, you were saying?

10:13.352 --> 10:15.453
The Falcon Unit, it's a private company

10:15.488 --> 10:17.756
that specializes
in transporting sensitive

10:17.791 --> 10:20.292
and occasionally illegal items
for wealthy clients.

10:20.326 --> 10:22.928
So our victim was
a transporter, like the movie?

10:22.962 --> 10:25.963
That explains the armored sports
car and secret compartment.

10:25.998 --> 10:27.598
So, what was in the briefcase?

10:27.632 --> 10:31.002
I'm afraid the answer
to that comes with a price.

10:31.036 --> 10:32.736
I want in on the investigation.

10:32.771 --> 10:34.638
And what's in this for you?

10:34.673 --> 10:38.142
The item in the briefcase has
a rather large insurance policy.

10:38.177 --> 10:40.077
The insurance company
has hired me to recover it.

10:40.112 --> 10:41.978
You know,
this isn't a treasure hunt.

10:42.013 --> 10:43.013
We're trying
to solve a homicide.

10:43.047 --> 10:45.315
And your victim was killed
for that briefcase,

10:45.349 --> 10:47.583
so you find your killer,
I find my missing item.

10:47.618 --> 10:49.463
Everyone goes home happy, hmm?

10:50.940 --> 10:51.693
Okay.

10:51.713 --> 10:54.191
So, what was our victim
hired to transport?

10:54.225 --> 10:56.657
A Van Gogh, lost since World War II,

10:56.677 --> 11:00.196
purchased at auction
3 weeks ago for $65 million.

11:02.435 --> 11:04.860
S08E05
The Nose

11:04.880 --> 11:07.945
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

11:09.498 --> 11:12.368
Long-lost Van Gogh sold for a fortune.

11:12.388 --> 11:13.734
How come this wasn't
on the Internet?

11:13.768 --> 11:15.802
The painting
has a complicated history.

11:15.837 --> 11:17.771
It was looted several times
during the war,

11:17.805 --> 11:20.273
which made
an aboveboard sale impossible,

11:20.307 --> 11:22.075
so it was auctioned
secretly in Zurich,

11:22.109 --> 11:23.877
with potential buyers
bidding remotely.

11:23.911 --> 11:25.545
We should get a list
of the other bidders.

11:25.580 --> 11:26.980
Maybe one of the losers
tried to steal it.

11:27.014 --> 11:29.640
I already tried. Auction house
isn't playing ball.

11:29.660 --> 11:31.650
I mean, they give up their clients,
they lose their business.

11:31.685 --> 11:33.619
You know what? I'll reach out
to the state department,

11:33.653 --> 11:34.820
see if they can apply
a little pressure.

11:34.855 --> 11:36.822
I think I found our killer.

11:36.857 --> 11:39.658
An ATM camera caught a guy
matching our witness' description

11:39.693 --> 11:41.560
exiting the parking garage
at 10:30.

11:41.595 --> 11:42.928
That's 15 minutes
after the murder.

11:42.962 --> 11:44.263
How come he was still around?

11:44.297 --> 11:45.598
Probably stashing the briefcase.

11:45.632 --> 11:47.099
Two minutes later,
a subway cam caught him

11:47.133 --> 11:48.199
hopping the "f" train.

11:48.233 --> 11:50.835
Now, his Metro card was
purchased with a credit card

11:50.870 --> 11:53.438
belonging to a Freddy Stark,
a low-level dirtbag

11:53.472 --> 11:55.673
with a history of B&E and violent assault.

11:55.708 --> 11:57.842
Nice job, Sarge.
[Chuckles]

11:59.018 --> 12:01.591
So, Beckett and I had been
married almost a year,

12:01.611 --> 12:02.944
and... and things were going great,

12:02.964 --> 12:04.848
and then, suddenly,
she says she needs space.

12:04.883 --> 12:06.172
Why is that my problem?

12:06.192 --> 12:08.184
Oh, it's not,
but I-I was just thinking,

12:08.219 --> 12:10.186
you're so attuned
to pheromone output,

12:10.221 --> 12:12.756
you could help me with
my interactions with Beckett,

12:12.791 --> 12:14.658
let me know
when I'm being charming,

12:14.692 --> 12:16.693
let me know
when I'm annoying her.

12:16.728 --> 12:17.528
You mean like this?

12:17.562 --> 12:19.430
Hey, Castle, you're being annoying.

12:19.464 --> 12:20.464
Yes, only I'm thinking

12:20.498 --> 12:23.433
more like a secret
hand gesture so she doesn't...

12:23.467 --> 12:24.867
You mean right now?

12:24.902 --> 12:26.168
Yeah.

12:26.202 --> 12:30.105
Listen, you are actually fairly
inoffensive on an odor level,

12:30.140 --> 12:31.941
but I am not a people person

12:31.975 --> 12:34.477
and have zero interest
in becoming one.

12:34.511 --> 12:36.045
Let me in. Let me convince you.

12:36.079 --> 12:38.280
Forget it.
No one goes inside but me.

12:38.315 --> 12:41.286
Well, that sounds lonely.

12:42.051 --> 12:43.051
It's not.

12:43.085 --> 12:44.886
Uh, no. I-I-I'm not...

12:44.921 --> 12:45.854
Five minutes.

12:45.888 --> 12:48.557
If I haven't convinced you,
you can just kick me out.

12:48.591 --> 12:49.960
Fine.

12:50.233 --> 12:53.141
But you have to be decontaminated.

12:53.161 --> 12:54.329
Sounds like fun.

12:55.097 --> 12:56.710
[Door closes]

13:01.269 --> 13:02.703
Whoa!

13:02.737 --> 13:04.872
[Screaming]

13:06.207 --> 13:07.541
Wow!

13:07.576 --> 13:09.142
Whoa!

13:20.120 --> 13:21.452
Ah. You work from home.

13:21.472 --> 13:24.858
I consult for a perfume company
as a professional nose,

13:24.892 --> 13:28.394
specializing in primal attraction.

13:28.428 --> 13:31.497
And yet you live alone
and never have visitors.

13:31.531 --> 13:32.898
I see people.

13:32.932 --> 13:36.167
I go into the office
once a week.

13:36.202 --> 13:37.202
That's all I can handle.

13:37.236 --> 13:39.022
And besides, look what
happens when you leave.

13:39.042 --> 13:42.240
You wind up riding an elevator
with a sweaty killer.

13:42.749 --> 13:43.876
You could smell his sweat.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.231
And his gun.

13:45.430 --> 13:46.708
What else?

13:46.945 --> 13:49.013
Nothing.

13:49.047 --> 13:51.115
Bull. You're like a bloodhound.

13:51.149 --> 13:52.750
You just don't want to get involved.

13:52.784 --> 13:54.585
But I'm betting you could
identify this killer

13:54.620 --> 13:56.053
if you smelled him again.

13:57.990 --> 13:58.923
That's nice.

13:58.957 --> 14:01.291
- You an art fan, Freddy?
- I like comic books.

14:01.326 --> 14:03.704
- How about Van Gogh?
- I never heard of him.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.762
Where were you
at 10:15 this morning?

14:05.796 --> 14:08.031
I was uptown, walking my cat.

14:08.065 --> 14:09.799
And yet we have proof that you
were in the east village,

14:09.834 --> 14:10.901
committing a homicide.

14:10.935 --> 14:11.935
Never happened.

14:11.969 --> 14:14.270
My cat hates the east village.
[Knock on door]

14:14.304 --> 14:15.907
Uh, Captain?

14:18.643 --> 14:21.476
Um, it's Castle.
He's on the phone.

14:21.511 --> 14:23.781
- He says he's got a break in the case.
- What case?

14:24.781 --> 14:26.782
This case?
[Clears throat]

14:26.816 --> 14:29.484
How does he even know
about this case?

14:29.519 --> 14:30.819
Now, is that any way
to talk to the man

14:30.854 --> 14:31.921
who can I.D. your killer?

14:31.955 --> 14:33.789
Wait. You can I.D. him?

14:34.691 --> 14:36.731
- Well, no, but Mia can.
- No, I can't.

14:37.593 --> 14:38.560
Who's Mia?

14:38.594 --> 14:39.827
She's an eyewitness...

14:39.862 --> 14:42.797
well, technically,
she's a... nose-witness.

14:42.831 --> 14:43.665
Please put that down.

14:43.699 --> 14:45.967
She shared an elevator
with our killer,

14:46.001 --> 14:48.002
who was wearing a mask.

14:48.037 --> 14:52.073
That doesn't matter because
she can I.D. him by his smell.

14:52.107 --> 14:54.675
Yeah, she said that
he smelled like gunpowder.

14:54.709 --> 14:55.842
Look, I'm gonna hang up.

14:55.877 --> 14:57.778
This isn't time for party games.

14:57.812 --> 14:59.846
It's not a party game.

14:59.881 --> 15:02.849
Okay, then tell us something
unique about the killer's scent.

15:02.884 --> 15:04.184
Yeah.

15:04.218 --> 15:07.588
There was a hint of nail-polish remover.

15:09.951 --> 15:13.192
A six-foot-tall guy who smells
like nail-Polish remover.

15:13.226 --> 15:14.860
This is a waste of time.

15:14.895 --> 15:16.295
Hang on. Tell her the thing.

15:16.329 --> 15:17.930
Okay, how about this?

15:17.965 --> 15:20.299
There was an old oil painting
in that briefcase.

15:22.302 --> 15:23.869
Boom.

15:23.904 --> 15:25.270
How do you know that?

15:25.305 --> 15:27.272
Are you slow? I smelled it.

15:27.307 --> 15:29.007
Are you sure you want her back?

15:29.041 --> 15:30.274
'Cause I think you can do better.

15:30.309 --> 15:31.977
This... uh, uh, Beckett, we're
gonna come down to the precinct.

15:32.011 --> 15:33.511
No! Castle...
[Cellphone beeps]

15:33.545 --> 15:35.146
I'm not going.

15:35.180 --> 15:36.280
Yes, you are.

15:36.315 --> 15:39.017
Why? Because you think I can
help you get your wife back?

15:39.051 --> 15:42.186
No. Well, y-yes.

15:42.511 --> 15:46.356
But because a man
was murdered this morning,

15:46.390 --> 15:48.892
and that man deserves justice.

15:48.927 --> 15:51.194
You know, you see your
hyperosmia as a curse,

15:51.229 --> 15:53.731
when, really, you've been given
a great gift.

15:53.765 --> 15:55.298
And with your help,

15:55.333 --> 15:58.348
the police can put away
a cold-blooded killer.

15:58.510 --> 16:01.538
Now, isn't that worth
putting yourself out there?

16:03.340 --> 16:04.507
No.

16:04.541 --> 16:06.408
And there is nothing you can do

16:06.443 --> 16:08.344
to make me leave my apartment.

16:08.378 --> 16:09.311
Nothing?

16:09.346 --> 16:10.980
Nothing.

16:18.756 --> 16:19.821
Ugh!

16:19.856 --> 16:20.889
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God.

16:20.923 --> 16:23.825
Ew! Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

16:23.860 --> 16:25.360
[Gasps] Whoa.

16:25.394 --> 16:27.295
Oh, you were right
about those tacos.

16:49.951 --> 16:51.585
[Sniffing]

17:23.782 --> 17:25.282
[Buzzer]

17:29.810 --> 17:31.725
He's not the killer.

17:31.745 --> 17:34.393
If word gets out that
I authorized a smell lineup...

17:34.413 --> 17:36.527
They have visual lineups for
people who have seen killers,

17:36.547 --> 17:39.130
voice lineups for people
who have heard them.

17:39.164 --> 17:44.291
But regardless, we know
Freddy was at the garage,

17:44.311 --> 17:46.178
and he's clearly lying, so...

17:46.198 --> 17:48.439
So we lie to him, tell him
that our witness I.D.'d him.

17:48.473 --> 17:49.440
And watch him talk.

17:49.474 --> 17:51.007
[Sniffing]

17:53.311 --> 17:54.878
I didn't kill him!

17:54.912 --> 17:56.313
That's not what
our witness says.

17:56.348 --> 17:57.948
What kind of lineup
was that, anyway?

17:57.982 --> 17:59.550
The witness didn't even look
at my face!

17:59.584 --> 18:01.484
- Where's the painting?
- I don't have it.

18:01.518 --> 18:02.719
Cut the crap, Freddy.

18:02.753 --> 18:04.654
You got one chance
to convince me

18:04.688 --> 18:06.389
that you're not the murderer.

18:06.423 --> 18:08.324
Okay, listen,
I was at the garage,

18:08.359 --> 18:09.826
but not to kill the guy.

18:09.860 --> 18:11.794
- I was hired to retrieve the painting.
- By who?

18:11.829 --> 18:12.729
Tom Gilliam. Head of the Falcon Unit.

18:12.763 --> 18:14.831
That's who hired Justin to transport it.

18:14.865 --> 18:16.833
Why would they want you
to steal it from him?

18:16.867 --> 18:17.834
I don't know.

18:17.868 --> 18:19.234
But Gilliam was really upset

18:19.268 --> 18:20.819
when he hired me
to hunt Justin down,

18:20.839 --> 18:22.971
told me to do whatever it took
to get the painting back.

18:23.005 --> 18:24.939
So I hacked the GPS in Justin's car

18:24.974 --> 18:26.441
and followed him to the garage.

18:26.476 --> 18:27.809
But by the time I got there,

18:27.844 --> 18:30.912
he was already dead
and the painting was gone.

18:30.946 --> 18:32.447
What time did you get there?

18:32.482 --> 18:34.687
Didn't get to the garage
till 10:20.

18:36.818 --> 18:38.646
Esposito: All right, thanks.

18:39.130 --> 18:40.688
Captain confirms Freddy's story.

18:40.722 --> 18:43.758
So he arrived after Mia called 911.

18:43.792 --> 18:45.426
Which means he ain't our guy.

18:45.460 --> 18:47.261
So, how do you want to go
at this Falcon Unit dude?

18:47.295 --> 18:48.603
I say we hit him hard.

18:48.623 --> 18:50.698
Guys like this only respond
to intimidation.

18:50.732 --> 18:52.299
Is that the way it's gonna be now?

18:52.333 --> 18:54.701
"I get this big promotion,
and I say we do it this way."

18:54.735 --> 18:57.218
Hey, hey, no. We can do it your way.

18:57.479 --> 18:59.564
How do you want to play it?

19:00.908 --> 19:03.710
I say we go at him hard.
Excuse me!

19:03.744 --> 19:05.311
Tom Gilliam, I'm Detective Ryan.

19:05.345 --> 19:06.679
This is Detective Esposito.

19:06.714 --> 19:09.648
We just have a few questions
about the murder of Justin Fletcher.

19:09.682 --> 19:12.428
A real tragedy, but I don't know
anything about it.

19:12.448 --> 19:15.034
That's funny, 'cause
Freddy Stark says you do.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.362
How can I help you?

19:24.397 --> 19:26.798
Well, you can start by
telling us why you hired Freddy

19:26.832 --> 19:29.166
to steal that painting
back from your own employee.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.368
You got it all wrong.
I didn't hire Freddy to steal it.

19:31.403 --> 19:32.904
I hired him to retrieve it.

19:32.938 --> 19:34.338
Justin stole it from us.

19:34.372 --> 19:35.740
Esposito: That doesn't make sense.

19:35.774 --> 19:37.575
You hired Justin
to transport the painting.

19:37.609 --> 19:39.744
No. I hired someone else.

19:39.778 --> 19:43.814
Transporters work on commission,
payable upon delivery,

19:43.848 --> 19:46.917
and the commission for
that painting was six figures.

19:46.951 --> 19:49.385
Justin must have gotten greedy
and jumped the job.

19:49.420 --> 19:51.822
We didn't realize until
the <i>real</i> transporter arrived

19:51.856 --> 19:54.357
to pick up the painting,
and it was gone.

19:55.426 --> 19:57.193
Then who's the real transporter?

19:58.062 --> 20:01.931
Liam Hollister, ex-British mercenary.

20:01.965 --> 20:04.667
Kicked out of the French foreign
legion for being too violent.

20:04.701 --> 20:05.668
According to Hayley,

20:05.702 --> 20:07.703
Liam is Falcon's go-to guy
for big-money jobs.

20:07.737 --> 20:09.237
I don't think
he'd take too kindly

20:09.272 --> 20:10.739
to Justin stealing
his commission.

20:10.774 --> 20:11.540
Might go rogue.

20:11.575 --> 20:13.576
So he tracked Justin
to that garage

20:13.610 --> 20:15.410
and traded two bullets
for that painting.

20:15.445 --> 20:17.212
You'd think he'd be rolling
around in something

20:17.246 --> 20:18.947
a little more subtle
after committing murder.

20:18.981 --> 20:19.948
Yeah.

20:19.982 --> 20:23.250
Hey, bro... Are we good?

20:24.321 --> 20:25.687
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

20:25.721 --> 20:26.621
Why do you even ask?

20:26.655 --> 20:28.289
'Cause you've been
acting weird all day.

20:28.924 --> 20:30.424
And I know that you're bummed,

20:30.459 --> 20:33.121
but you never even gave me
props for passing.

20:33.643 --> 20:36.964
Yeah. Javi, you're right, man.

20:37.229 --> 20:39.766
Congratulations, man. Really.

20:40.356 --> 20:41.768
Thanks, bro.

20:45.740 --> 20:47.191
Here we go.

Javi, you okay?

21:39.891 --> 21:42.926
No! You shot me in the ass!

21:42.960 --> 21:44.326
Ow!

[Whimpering]

21:46.396 --> 21:47.764
[Groans]

21:48.828 --> 21:51.347
- You shot your partner.
- Hayley: In the ass.

21:51.367 --> 21:53.130
It was an accident.

21:53.150 --> 21:54.899
The hospital says
he's gonna be fine.

21:54.933 --> 21:56.267
Just needs a few stitches.

21:56.301 --> 21:57.934
And a new pair of trousers.

21:58.737 --> 22:00.114
Any sign of Liam?

22:00.548 --> 22:03.073
No, but he fled in his rolls,

22:03.107 --> 22:06.644
so we've got Vikram
monitoring every street cam

22:06.678 --> 22:07.645
at every crossing in the city,

22:07.679 --> 22:09.647
which means if he tries
to get out of Manhattan,

22:09.681 --> 22:10.447
we will find him.

22:10.482 --> 22:12.483
Well, I will coordinate with him,

22:12.517 --> 22:14.617
start digging into Liam's life,

22:14.652 --> 22:17.620
try and figure out
where he might go to ground.

22:17.655 --> 22:19.289
[Door opens, closes]

22:19.323 --> 22:21.324
You know Liam's gonna ditch
the car, right?

22:21.358 --> 22:22.258
I know.

22:22.293 --> 22:24.032
A ride like that
would fetch top dollar.

22:24.052 --> 22:26.529
If Liam's bolting,
he might want some quick cash.

22:26.563 --> 22:27.697
Who are you calling?

22:27.731 --> 22:29.365
Your husband.

22:29.400 --> 22:31.166
I reckon that he might have
some friends

22:31.200 --> 22:34.445
who would know where
to sell a hot rolls in a hurry.

22:35.202 --> 22:36.838
Why are you still here?

22:36.872 --> 22:37.972
The case isn't over yet.

22:38.007 --> 22:39.174
It is for <i>me.</i>

22:39.208 --> 22:40.642
I saw you back at the precinct.

22:40.677 --> 22:42.377

22:47.849 --> 22:50.017
I'll ask around. Okay.

22:50.051 --> 22:51.218
All right, we have a new mission...

22:51.252 --> 22:54.388
to find where our suspect
might sell a high-end Rolls-Royce.

22:54.423 --> 22:56.123
I can't help you with that.

22:56.157 --> 22:58.693
But you can I.D. him
once we get there.

22:58.727 --> 23:01.204
Wha... why are you
doing this to me?

23:01.224 --> 23:04.031
Because you helped me out,
and now I'm returning the favor.

23:04.065 --> 23:05.870
By torturing me?

23:07.034 --> 23:08.668
No.

23:08.703 --> 23:10.786
Mia, you're...
you're not living.

23:10.806 --> 23:12.038
You're hiding.

23:12.072 --> 23:14.874
I know you find the world
a little overwhelming,

23:14.908 --> 23:17.477
but out here,
this is where life happens.

23:17.917 --> 23:20.880
So... Let's go.

[Groans] I can handle it myself.

23:41.533 --> 23:44.005
Javi, it was an accident.

23:45.537 --> 23:48.339
Hey, what are you doing here?
Go home.

23:48.374 --> 23:49.774
No. I'm here to work.

23:49.808 --> 23:51.942
- But you were shot.
- It's just a flesh wound.

23:51.977 --> 23:53.678
If he's working, then I'm working.

23:53.712 --> 23:56.246
So, I just got Liam's phone records.

23:56.280 --> 23:58.782
He called Hawthorne Carter
less than half an hour ago.

23:58.816 --> 24:00.450
Why is that name so familiar?

24:00.485 --> 24:02.586
He's a hedge-fund billionaire
whose hobbies include

24:02.620 --> 24:05.689
world domination and art collection.

24:05.723 --> 24:07.691
Tell him the only way I'll sell

24:07.725 --> 24:10.059
is if he lets me come down
and punch him in the face.

24:10.094 --> 24:10.994
No, the drapes are great.

24:11.028 --> 24:13.596
Mr. Carter, you need
to get off the phones.

24:13.630 --> 24:14.563
Now.

24:14.598 --> 24:16.098
Fine. I'll call you back.

24:17.133 --> 24:18.434
Both phones, please.

24:18.468 --> 24:19.935
- Uh, hey!
- Goodbye.

24:20.804 --> 24:21.837
Sit down

24:21.872 --> 24:25.028
or I will arrest you for
conspiracy to commit murder.

24:27.243 --> 24:29.144
Lorenzo, what is she talking about?

24:29.178 --> 24:30.311
The Van Gogh, sir.

24:30.345 --> 24:32.881
Three weeks ago, you bid on it
at an auction, and you lost.

24:32.915 --> 24:34.282
This morning, it was stolen,

24:34.316 --> 24:35.950
and a man was found shot to death.

24:35.984 --> 24:38.052
Mr. Carter just got back from
Singapore this afternoon.

24:38.086 --> 24:39.487
No, we don't think you killed him.

24:39.522 --> 24:41.122
But you are in contact
with the man who did.

24:41.156 --> 24:43.591
Liam Hollister, the transporter.

24:43.626 --> 24:44.793
According to the Falcon Unit,

24:44.827 --> 24:46.294
you've engaged
his services numerous times.

24:46.328 --> 24:48.061
Yeah. He called, looking
to unload the painting.

24:48.095 --> 24:49.663
I only bid on it
'cause Lorenzo thought

24:49.697 --> 24:50.831
it would look great
hanging in my G5.

24:50.865 --> 24:52.579
So you're saying
you didn't agree to buy it?

24:52.599 --> 24:53.180
Hell no!

24:53.200 --> 24:55.402
I already bought a Jackson
Pollock to hang in there.

24:55.437 --> 24:57.504
Do you have any idea
where he is now?

24:57.539 --> 24:59.555
Nope, but when I said
no to the painting,

24:59.575 --> 25:02.743
he asked if I had any interest
in a used Rolls-Royce.

25:08.816 --> 25:10.349
Yes, sir? How can I help you?

25:10.369 --> 25:15.254
Yes. Uh... Monty sent me.

25:15.288 --> 25:16.581
I see.

25:16.590 --> 25:18.758
So your Ferrari was stolen?

25:18.792 --> 25:20.725
Yes, and I'm afraid
my poor insurance company

25:20.760 --> 25:23.395
is going to have to pay out
a fortune when I report it.

25:23.430 --> 25:25.531
Now, how much extra
can I look forward to making?

25:25.565 --> 25:27.066
Well, gonna have
to run some numbers,

25:27.100 --> 25:29.068
but I'll see what our foreign
buyers might pay for it.

25:29.102 --> 25:30.389
Thank you.

25:32.305 --> 25:34.273
Right. That looks like
Liam's car right there.

26:01.699 --> 26:03.333
- Yeah, back up.

I give up.

How the hell did the two of you
trap Liam in his own trunk?

and you two suck. Next question.

26:37.189 --> 26:38.356
Really? How?

26:38.390 --> 26:42.626
I... accidentally shot him
in the gluteus maximus.

26:42.661 --> 26:44.862
In the ass?! [Laughs]

26:45.083 --> 26:47.597
Well, maybe I should
give this to you.

26:47.631 --> 26:48.866
I'm sorry. This is so not funny.

26:48.900 --> 26:50.767
[Laughs] You're right.
It's hilarious.

26:50.801 --> 26:52.669
[Laughing] It's hilarious!

26:52.703 --> 26:54.771
Come on, Mia.
Let's make way for, uh,

26:54.805 --> 26:56.918
crack-shot Ryan and Assposito.

26:57.551 --> 26:59.251
[Laughs] "Assposito."

27:03.713 --> 27:05.447
Esposito: Liam, NYPD.

27:05.482 --> 27:08.159
We're about to open this trunk,
so don't do anything stupid.

27:13.556 --> 27:14.656
It wasn't me!

27:14.691 --> 27:16.859
So I guess it wasn't you
who had the stolen painting

27:16.894 --> 27:17.860
in the silver briefcase.

27:17.894 --> 27:19.160
I suppose it also wasn't you

27:19.195 --> 27:20.896
who tried to kill us
in that building.

27:20.930 --> 27:23.459
Oh, trust me, if I was trying
to kill you, you'd be dead.

27:23.479 --> 27:23.960
Wow.

27:23.980 --> 27:26.868
I was laying down a suppressive
fire in order to get away.

27:26.903 --> 27:29.304
I aimed to miss, unlike you, mate,

27:29.338 --> 27:32.040
who shot your own partner in the ass.

27:32.074 --> 27:34.242
[Laughs] Okay, l-let's
not concern ourselves

27:34.277 --> 27:36.143
with who shot detective Assp...

[laughs] Espo... Detective Esposito.

27:38.013 --> 27:40.647

Sit down or I'm locking you up!

27:41.682 --> 27:43.183
Oh.

27:43.218 --> 27:44.651
Over there.

27:44.685 --> 27:47.187
Rather, let's discuss
how you shot Justin.

27:47.222 --> 27:48.755
I'm telling you it wasn't me.

27:48.790 --> 27:50.757
Look, I get it. You were pissed.

27:50.792 --> 27:52.725
He jumped you
on that transporter job,

27:52.759 --> 27:54.593
screwed you
out of a big commission.

27:54.628 --> 27:55.494
And then you tracked him down,

27:55.529 --> 27:56.396
and you confronted him
in that garage.

27:56.430 --> 27:58.264
You probably didn't
even mean to kill.

27:58.299 --> 27:59.498
I didn't shoot Justin.

27:59.533 --> 28:00.900
Cut that crap.

28:00.935 --> 28:02.535
All the evidence points to you.

28:02.569 --> 28:04.570
Which is why
I ran from you guys.

28:04.604 --> 28:06.940
Look, I was
at that parking garage,

28:06.974 --> 28:09.074
but when I left,
Justin was alive.

28:09.108 --> 28:10.943
It's like you said,

28:10.977 --> 28:12.945
I confronted Justin,
but he apologized.

28:12.979 --> 28:13.912
He knew he did me wrong,

28:13.947 --> 28:16.415
so he gave me back
the painting, and I left.

28:16.449 --> 28:19.284
And someone else must have
come after me and shot him.

28:19.319 --> 28:21.386
Do you really expect us
to believe that?

28:21.421 --> 28:22.821
No.

28:23.889 --> 28:25.223
But it's the truth.

28:30.562 --> 28:33.197
This case against Liam
is pretty circumstantial.

28:33.231 --> 28:34.398
Well, hopefully,
ballistics can match

28:34.433 --> 28:35.399
his gun to the murder weapon.

28:35.434 --> 28:36.733
Mia: Yawn!

28:36.768 --> 28:39.036
I need food now.

28:39.071 --> 28:41.205
And just so you know,
when hungry,

28:41.239 --> 28:43.606
I do have a tendency
to become irritable.

28:43.640 --> 28:45.608
<i>You</i> irritable?
I don't believe it.

28:45.642 --> 28:47.444
Beautiful, isn't it?

28:47.478 --> 28:49.379
How long before I can return it
to my employer?

28:49.413 --> 28:50.913
Well, that's up to the D.A.

28:50.948 --> 28:51.814
It's a forgery, you know?

28:51.849 --> 28:53.883
- What?
- How do you know?

28:53.917 --> 28:55.585
You can smell it.

28:55.619 --> 28:59.322
Oil paint takes many years
to become fully dry.

28:59.357 --> 29:02.557
That smells way too fresh
to be from the 19th century.

29:02.592 --> 29:05.627
That's definitely not the painting
that was in the killer's briefcase.

29:05.661 --> 29:07.429
Maybe Liam was telling the truth?

29:07.464 --> 29:08.897
Ryan: If he was, it would explain

29:08.931 --> 29:09.999
why Justin gave up
the painting so easily.

29:10.033 --> 29:11.066
He knew it was a fake.

29:11.101 --> 29:13.635
Which means the real killer
is still out there,

29:13.669 --> 29:14.803
with the real painting.

29:14.837 --> 29:16.605
Oh, I love it
when there's a twist.

29:16.639 --> 29:18.439
And I love it
when my belly's full.

29:18.474 --> 29:20.475
I-I'm getting takeout right now.

29:20.509 --> 29:21.642
Restaurant food?

29:21.676 --> 29:23.777
Hell no!

29:23.812 --> 29:25.913
Home cooking only.

29:25.947 --> 29:28.349
Everything has to be
steamed with zero...

29:28.384 --> 29:30.485
and I mean zero... seasoning.

29:30.519 --> 29:32.786
If I even smell
or see a speck of salt,

29:32.821 --> 29:34.354
somebody is gonna get hurt.

29:34.389 --> 29:36.823
You're my ride, Castle. Let's go.

29:36.857 --> 29:39.034
Bon appetit, babe.

29:40.361 --> 29:41.861
Man.

29:41.896 --> 29:44.431
Mia, if you have a hankering
for a bland meal,

29:44.465 --> 29:46.633
I have a treat for you...
my mother's cooking.

29:46.667 --> 29:48.035
Martha: I heard that, Richard.

29:48.069 --> 29:49.836
I think gratitude
would be appropriate,

29:49.870 --> 29:53.305
since I am steaming this
ridiculous meal for you.

29:53.340 --> 29:55.156
Martha Rodgers.

29:55.566 --> 29:56.375
Yes.

29:56.410 --> 29:57.676
I'm sorry. Have we met?

29:57.710 --> 30:01.047
Uh, May 19, 1999.

30:01.081 --> 30:02.981
I saw you perform in "Pippin."

30:03.016 --> 30:03.982
[Gasps]

30:04.017 --> 30:06.218
Oh, my go... you remember that?

30:06.253 --> 30:08.520
Oh, yeah. Off-off-Broadway.

30:08.554 --> 30:10.021
Uh, mother, that was New Jersey.

30:10.056 --> 30:13.058
Off-off-Broadway, as I said.

30:13.092 --> 30:15.357
Well, isn't this nice?

30:15.377 --> 30:17.028
So you liked the production?

30:17.063 --> 30:18.863
No. Hated it.

30:18.897 --> 30:20.498
Plus, the theater smelled like

30:20.533 --> 30:22.300
limburger gravy
on a hot summer's day.

30:22.334 --> 30:25.969
But you... you were amazing.

30:26.003 --> 30:29.739
Really? So all day with
a best-selling author, nothing.

30:29.774 --> 30:30.674
20 seconds with my mother,

30:30.708 --> 30:32.142
you're a tweener
at a Taylor Swift concert?

30:32.177 --> 30:34.311
Don't be a hater, Richard.

30:34.345 --> 30:35.645
It's the power of theater.

30:35.680 --> 30:38.014
Go on, go on. You were raving.

30:38.049 --> 30:40.417
Your performance...
it was so moving.

30:40.452 --> 30:45.555
I completely forgot
how horrible my real life was.

30:45.589 --> 30:48.524
It was just...
it was the best day ever.

30:48.559 --> 30:50.993
Oh! Sweetheart.

30:51.027 --> 30:55.531
Oh! And you barely stink. Oh!

30:55.566 --> 30:57.066
Oh, coming from her,
that's high praise.

30:57.101 --> 30:58.212
[Chuckles]

30:59.428 --> 31:02.036
- Hey, Beckett, I got something.
<i>- We've</i> got something.

31:02.071 --> 31:03.105
Yeah, that's what I said.

31:03.139 --> 31:05.240
- That's not what you said.
- Okay, it's what I meant.

31:05.274 --> 31:06.575
Okay, you both get gold stars
for the day

31:06.609 --> 31:08.076
if just one of you can
tell me what's going on.

31:08.111 --> 31:10.278
<i>We</i> did some digging

31:10.313 --> 31:12.581
into this painting's
tortured history.

31:12.615 --> 31:13.848
Stolen during World War II.

31:13.882 --> 31:16.416
It ended up in a private collection
before coming up for auction.

31:16.436 --> 31:18.252
Apparently, stolen artwork
like this

31:18.286 --> 31:20.121
rarely ends up
in the hands of its owner.

31:20.155 --> 31:22.123
What does any of this have
to do with Justin's murder?

31:22.157 --> 31:23.124
Everything.

31:23.158 --> 31:24.774
The Van Gogh is connected
to somebody we know.

31:24.794 --> 31:25.425
Who?

31:25.445 --> 31:27.228
Two years ago,
there was a failed legal claim

31:27.262 --> 31:29.463
on behalf of the family that
the painting was stolen from.

31:29.498 --> 31:31.265
And guess who filed it.

31:32.734 --> 31:35.801
Oh, so glad you wanted
a second helping.

31:35.836 --> 31:38.037
Thank you, Martha. It's perfect.

31:38.071 --> 31:39.071
I think my palate fell asleep.

31:39.106 --> 31:40.806
[Knock on door]

31:40.841 --> 31:42.642
Oh. That will be
the takeout for you and me.

31:42.676 --> 31:43.643
Well done.

31:43.677 --> 31:45.645
Mmm!

31:45.679 --> 31:48.047
Hel...

31:49.250 --> 31:51.583
Mother, what exactly did you order?

31:53.414 --> 31:55.563
Mr. Castle,
you're coming with me.

31:55.583 --> 31:57.664
Oh, no, he is not.

31:57.684 --> 31:58.851
Oh, mother, it's...
it's all right.

31:58.885 --> 32:00.853
Okay, so, uh, who are you?

32:00.887 --> 32:02.522
Who I am's not important.

32:02.556 --> 32:04.323
It's who you are that is.

32:04.358 --> 32:06.691
You're married to the captain
of the 12th precinct,

32:06.725 --> 32:09.027
where a certain work of art
is being held.

32:09.061 --> 32:10.295
You're going to go
and get it for me.

32:10.329 --> 32:12.164
Give me one good reason
why I should.

32:12.198 --> 32:13.632
I'll give you two.

32:13.666 --> 32:14.699
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

32:14.733 --> 32:16.701
Okay, okay. Put...
put the gun back... back to me.

32:16.735 --> 32:17.636
Point it at me.

32:17.670 --> 32:19.671
Look, that painting belongs
to my family.

32:19.705 --> 32:21.973
My father spent his life
trying to find it.

32:22.007 --> 32:23.541
He died a broken man.

32:23.575 --> 32:24.622
There's no way
I'm going to let it

32:24.642 --> 32:27.511
sit in some billionaire's man cave.

32:27.853 --> 32:29.947
Okay, I get it. I do.

32:29.982 --> 32:33.450
And I want to help you,
honestly.

32:34.186 --> 32:36.954
But I can't get that painting
even if I tried.

32:36.989 --> 32:38.356
And why is that?

32:38.390 --> 32:40.357
Lucy's not gonna let me.

32:40.391 --> 32:41.824
Who the hell's Lucy?

32:41.859 --> 32:42.825
She's right behind you.

32:42.860 --> 32:44.526
<i>Technically, I am to his left.</i>

32:46.730 --> 32:47.830
Oh!

32:52.069 --> 32:53.436
Aah! Oh!

32:54.505 --> 32:56.805
Did you see that?!
Knocked him out with one punch!

32:56.839 --> 32:58.540
[Groans] And he wasn't the only one.

32:58.574 --> 33:00.675
Ow! Aah!

33:02.176 --> 33:03.529
Oops.

33:15.068 --> 33:17.392
Rick, are you okay?

33:17.426 --> 33:19.527
[Sighs] Far from it.

33:19.561 --> 33:22.497
[Sighs] I think Mia is gonna sue us
for everything we've got.

33:22.531 --> 33:24.652
[Nasally] Yeah.
He broke my money-maker.

33:24.950 --> 33:27.868
- I said I was sorry.
- Well, uh, there's more bad news.

33:27.903 --> 33:31.271
Lorenzo's <i>not</i> our killer.
I spoke with his co-workers.

33:31.305 --> 33:33.073
He's got a rock-solid alibi.

33:33.107 --> 33:33.907
Well, that makes sense.

33:33.941 --> 33:35.409
If he was willing to kill Justin,

33:35.443 --> 33:36.476
he'd already have the Van Gogh

33:36.511 --> 33:38.069
and he wouldn't have asked me
to steal the fake one.

33:38.089 --> 33:41.348
Hold on. The Van Gogh
you recovered is the forgery?

33:41.382 --> 33:43.583
How do you know
about the forgery?

33:43.617 --> 33:45.519
Lorenzo, you are in
a world of trouble.

33:45.553 --> 33:48.554
Your best bet is to tell us
everything you know now.

33:48.588 --> 33:50.689
I have spent my entire adult life

33:50.723 --> 33:52.425
searching for that painting.

33:52.459 --> 33:53.759
When I heard it was
coming up for auction,

33:53.793 --> 33:55.194
I tried to get my boss
to buy it.

33:55.228 --> 33:56.295
But he wouldn't.

33:56.329 --> 33:59.432
No, but I knew Justin
from some of his deliveries.

33:59.466 --> 34:02.234
I did some research,
learned that we had three weeks

34:02.269 --> 34:03.702
before the painting was
to be moved,

34:03.736 --> 34:05.636
so we hatched a plan.

34:05.671 --> 34:08.106
Justin would jump
Liam's transporter job

34:08.139 --> 34:10.542
and switch the Van Gogh
with the fake.

34:10.576 --> 34:12.444
And you provided the forgery?

34:12.478 --> 34:15.646
No, from the very beginning,
Justin said he knew a guy.

34:16.358 --> 34:18.248
That's why he went
to the parking garage...

34:18.284 --> 34:20.251
to pick up the forged painting.

34:20.286 --> 34:21.784
Beckett.

34:23.020 --> 34:25.489
Whoever forged that painting
is the killer.

34:25.523 --> 34:27.056
He killed Justin
for the real Van Gogh.

34:27.092 --> 34:29.259
But Justin gave Liam the fake
in the parking garage.

34:29.293 --> 34:30.327
Yeah, so?

34:30.360 --> 34:33.130
So, the exchange happened
before Liam even arrived.

34:33.164 --> 34:34.431
That doesn't mean
the killer was gone.

34:34.466 --> 34:35.632
He could have just been hiding.

34:35.666 --> 34:39.101
What if Liam drove up just
as the swap was taking place?

34:39.136 --> 34:40.469
Then the killer would take cover.

34:40.504 --> 34:43.072
Right. So Liam drives away
with the forgery,

34:43.107 --> 34:44.907
killer comes back out,
kills Justin for the real one.

34:44.940 --> 34:46.809
That's a possibility.

34:46.842 --> 34:51.614
Then the question is, how do
we identify this mystery man?

34:51.648 --> 34:53.014
By his smell.

34:53.049 --> 34:54.484
Well, that's a great idea, Castle,

34:54.518 --> 34:57.143
but you literally
just broke the nose.

34:58.988 --> 35:00.978
Well, then, it's up to us.

35:04.627 --> 35:07.162
Justin parked here
to meet with the forger,

35:07.196 --> 35:09.498
which means Liam must
have driven in from over there.

35:09.532 --> 35:12.133
So the killer must have
headed away from here

35:12.167 --> 35:14.502
to avoid being spotted.

35:14.536 --> 35:16.270
[Machinery whirring] But, you know,
the stairwell's the best option,

35:16.304 --> 35:17.938
but that's on the opposite side.

35:17.972 --> 35:20.707
Mia said the killer smelled like
nail-polish remover.

35:20.742 --> 35:22.543
Yeah, which is unusual.

35:22.577 --> 35:24.612
What is that noise?

35:24.646 --> 35:27.515
It sounds like an air-conditioning unit
on its last legs.

35:27.549 --> 35:29.549
- That's it.
- What's it?

35:29.583 --> 35:31.217
Nail-polish remover.

35:31.252 --> 35:32.652
Smells like nail-polish remover

35:32.686 --> 35:35.188
because of its
active ingredient, acetone.

35:35.222 --> 35:36.623
Air-conditioning units leak.

35:36.657 --> 35:38.724
Specifically, they leak freon.

35:38.759 --> 35:39.892
Freon smells...

35:39.926 --> 35:41.394
Both: Like acetone.

35:41.428 --> 35:44.997
The killer must have been
standing next to a freon leak.

35:45.032 --> 35:47.499
He probably squeezed up
against this pillar,

35:47.534 --> 35:50.302
and that's how he got the freon
transferred onto him.

35:50.336 --> 35:53.238
And, uh, <i>this...</i>

35:53.273 --> 35:56.708
May very well be his hair.

35:56.742 --> 35:58.677
We have the killer's DNA.

36:02.180 --> 36:04.395
- Thanks for coming back in, Graham.
- Not a problem.

36:04.415 --> 36:06.879
So, there was an update
to my brother's case?

36:06.899 --> 36:09.202
Yeah, uh... Justin.

36:09.222 --> 36:12.466
Now, he paid
your college tuition,

36:12.486 --> 36:14.559
didn't he, at the art institute?

36:15.043 --> 36:16.559
What's that have to do
with anything?

36:16.593 --> 36:18.160
Well, we heard that you were
an amazing painter.

36:18.194 --> 36:20.995
Uh, gifted,
according to your professors.

36:21.383 --> 36:22.959
But a lousy gambler.

36:24.026 --> 36:25.834
Yeah. We checked.

36:25.868 --> 36:27.802
You had markers and I.O.U.S
all over the city.

36:27.837 --> 36:30.104
At underground casinos...
the kind of establishments

36:30.138 --> 36:32.774
that don't take kindly
when you can't pay up.

36:32.808 --> 36:34.241
I bet you thought
it was your lucky day

36:34.276 --> 36:36.277
when your brother asked you
to forge that Van Gogh.

36:36.311 --> 36:38.345
Justin was gonna
sell the original painting.

36:38.379 --> 36:39.780
The two of you
would split the profits,

36:39.814 --> 36:42.583
but when you found out
that he was just gonna

36:42.617 --> 36:44.785
give that painting away,
you got a little pissed.

36:44.819 --> 36:46.186
That's ridiculous.

36:46.220 --> 36:47.788
I-it doesn't prove
that I killed him, either.

36:47.822 --> 36:49.823
No, but the hair
at the crime scene does.

36:49.858 --> 36:51.658
We ran the DNA.

36:51.693 --> 36:54.126
It's a match
to your brother by 54%...

36:54.160 --> 36:56.762
also known as a sibling match.

36:56.797 --> 36:59.699
Now, you're
a gambling man, right?

36:59.733 --> 37:03.369
So how much do you want to bet
that when we run that hair

37:03.403 --> 37:06.772
against the DNA
from this glass...

37:06.807 --> 37:08.841
It's gonna be an exact match?

37:10.410 --> 37:12.443
And we have a warrant
for your place.

37:12.478 --> 37:14.846
Now, what are we
gonna find there?

37:14.881 --> 37:17.148
The gun that you used?

37:17.182 --> 37:18.683
The original Van Gogh?

37:22.070 --> 37:24.689
H-he was my brother.
I-I-I didn't want to kill him.

37:24.724 --> 37:27.158
I just... I-I needed the money.

37:31.863 --> 37:33.664
So, can you tell the difference?
[Scoffs]

37:34.900 --> 37:38.802
Uh... No.
Not at all. [Chuckles]

37:38.837 --> 37:40.838
Oh, I, uh, spoke
to the current owner,

37:40.872 --> 37:43.340
told him the whole story,
and he pledged

37:43.374 --> 37:45.141
that he's going to give it
to the state museum

37:45.175 --> 37:47.043
while Lorenzo's family's issue
is being adjudicated.

37:47.077 --> 37:49.178
So, bit of a happy ending.

37:49.212 --> 37:51.514
Well, it was a pleasure
working with you.

37:51.549 --> 37:53.917
Yeah. You too.

37:53.951 --> 37:56.385
You're not so bad for a cop.

37:56.420 --> 38:00.156
Thank you.
You're not so bad for a-a...

38:00.190 --> 38:01.890
What... what exactly do you do?

38:01.925 --> 38:03.191
Mm.

38:05.862 --> 38:07.563
Hey, you need any help?

38:07.597 --> 38:08.764
Not from you.

38:08.798 --> 38:10.265
Javi, look...

38:13.302 --> 38:15.618
Could you find it
in your heart to forgive me?

38:21.264 --> 38:22.677
All right.

38:22.711 --> 38:24.511
We're cool?

38:24.546 --> 38:25.880
Yeah.

38:28.984 --> 38:30.718
Ow! Oh!

38:30.752 --> 38:32.019
I'm sorry. [Groans]

38:32.054 --> 38:33.454
I'm sorry.

38:33.488 --> 38:35.022
What, like you didn't
mean to do that?

38:35.057 --> 38:36.122
Th-that was an accident!

38:36.156 --> 38:38.124
Well, it seems like
there's been a lot of accidents

38:38.158 --> 38:40.460
around here lately, Detective.

38:40.494 --> 38:44.530
Oh. Oh, it's gonna be like that, <i>Sarge?</i>

38:44.565 --> 38:46.432
Okay.

38:46.467 --> 38:48.134
Let's make it even then.

38:48.168 --> 38:51.437
Eye for an eye,
cheek for a cheek.

38:51.472 --> 38:53.205
Get your revenge, okay?

38:53.239 --> 38:54.740
Shoot me in the ass.

38:54.774 --> 38:56.475
Go. Now.

38:56.509 --> 38:58.911
Shoot me in the ass. Come on.

38:58.945 --> 39:00.245
Do it right now.
Hey, man. Get up.

39:00.279 --> 39:01.780
Let's squash this right now!
Just a quick pop!

39:01.815 --> 39:03.248
He's... he's playing.
Right in the butt, go!

39:03.282 --> 39:06.051
- Hey!
- You're embarrassing me.

39:06.086 --> 39:07.486
Knock it off!

39:07.520 --> 39:08.553
- Well, he started it with his...
- You know what?

39:08.588 --> 39:10.822
If the two of you can't
figure this out on your own,

39:10.856 --> 39:12.890
then you're doing it in therapy,
and that's an order...

39:12.925 --> 39:14.463
no ifs, ands, or buts.

39:15.245 --> 39:16.761
I didn't mean it like that.

39:19.098 --> 39:21.099
How... hi.

39:21.133 --> 39:24.168
How are you feeling... or,
rather, how are you smelling?

39:24.202 --> 39:26.937
Oh, the doctor said my schnoz
should go back to normal

39:26.971 --> 39:28.438
once the swelling goes down.
[Sighs]

39:28.472 --> 39:30.007
Those for me?

39:30.041 --> 39:32.475
Yeah. They're paper
so you don't have to smell.

39:32.510 --> 39:35.512
I-I-I-I'm so sorry
for everything.

39:35.546 --> 39:36.947
Don't. Come on.

39:36.981 --> 39:39.916
I did some pretty extraordinary
things yesterday.

39:41.422 --> 39:43.718
And you were right.
I haven't been living.

39:43.738 --> 39:46.038
And thanks to you, now I will.

39:48.158 --> 39:50.126
Well, then, I think
you're gonna like that card.

39:50.160 --> 39:51.927
Oh.

39:51.962 --> 39:55.437
It's a couple of tickets
to my mother's new play.

39:55.457 --> 39:56.666
Ah!

39:56.700 --> 39:58.801
[Gasps]

39:58.835 --> 40:00.502
Mia, I just think
the world's a better place

40:00.537 --> 40:02.336
with you running around in it.

40:08.744 --> 40:10.845
You know what?
You're easier to be around

40:10.880 --> 40:12.947
when I can't smell you.

40:12.982 --> 40:14.315
Thanks.

40:18.920 --> 40:21.321
Beckett still loves you...

40:21.732 --> 40:24.251
With a passion,

40:24.271 --> 40:27.394
and you don't have to measure
pheromones to sense that.
