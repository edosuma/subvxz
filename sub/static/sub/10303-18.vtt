01:16.880 --> 01:18.711
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Mom.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.839
Kelly, I am so glad you're home.

01:28.080 --> 01:29.513
I'm entering this new contest...

01:29.720 --> 01:32.393
...and I need you to think
of something clever.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.479
- Bud, is something wrong?
- Yeah.

01:42.680 --> 01:44.910
You just asked someone
with the IQ of mustard...

01:45.120 --> 01:46.917
...to think of something clever.

01:49.360 --> 01:53.638
I will have you know,
oh, winged monkey man...

01:54.520 --> 01:57.398
...that I am just as smart
as anybody else in this room.

01:57.640 --> 02:01.269
So you don't need to spell out "iquee"
around me.

02:03.280 --> 02:05.430
Bud, I'm so glad you're home.

02:06.120 --> 02:08.315
You see,
this feminine-hygiene company...

02:08.520 --> 02:12.308
...is looking for a sidekick for their
new mascot, Tubey the Tampon.

02:14.320 --> 02:15.548
You got any ideas?

02:17.320 --> 02:21.552
Mom, in Bud's defense, you're talking
about an area he knows nothing about.

02:21.760 --> 02:25.514
Now, if it had been for hand wigs
or, say, finger lingerie--

02:25.760 --> 02:30.276
Hey, hey, I think that's quite enough,
Kelly.

02:30.480 --> 02:33.517
I thought Dad banned you from
entering all these magazine contests.

02:33.720 --> 02:38.919
I don't enter that many contests.
I don't even get that many magazines.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.475
Mail call!

02:52.480 --> 02:55.995
<i>Well, let's see what came today.
Doll Maker.</i>

02:56.240 --> 02:58.754
<i>Lizard Quarterly.</i>

02:58.960 --> 03:00.951
<i>Look here, Ebony.</i>

03:01.200 --> 03:03.760
Esther Rolle moved, Peg.

03:04.720 --> 03:07.996
- Where?
- Closer to the fridge.

03:09.240 --> 03:12.596
<i>Oh, now, what have we here?
Amish Weekly.</i>

03:13.360 --> 03:16.830
New spring color: black.

03:18.480 --> 03:21.597
Mom, are you sure
anybody ever wins these contests?

03:21.840 --> 03:23.876
Would Ed McMahon lie?

03:24.080 --> 03:26.116
Gee, I don't know, would he drink?

03:26.680 --> 03:29.558
Would he laugh at something
that's not funny?

03:29.800 --> 03:31.597
Would he tout the taste of dog food...

03:31.800 --> 03:34.473
...if he thought he could make
a stinking buck?

03:35.080 --> 03:40.518
Peg, I'm telling you that nobody ever,
ever wins these contests.

03:48.760 --> 03:51.558
Hi, I'm Wolfman Jack.

03:54.480 --> 03:56.869
Let me in,
I'm gonna blow your mind out.

04:00.320 --> 04:03.392
Anybody here join a record club?

04:03.640 --> 04:07.030
Well, you know,
I'm talking about 30 years ago.

04:07.840 --> 04:09.831
No, I'm here to lay something good
on you.

04:10.080 --> 04:14.710
You guys have just won
our $1-million grand prize.

04:17.560 --> 04:20.471
I can't believe it!

04:20.680 --> 04:24.753
Peg, Peg, if you weren't my wife,
I'd kiss you.

04:26.040 --> 04:28.998
Congratulations, Mrs. O'Sullivan.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.355
- Well, my name isn't O'Sullivan.
- Mine is!

04:34.600 --> 04:37.160
Top of the morning to you,
Wolfman, me lad.

04:39.080 --> 04:41.355
Listen, Lojack.

04:42.680 --> 04:45.558
That's Wolfman Jack.

04:45.800 --> 04:48.234
Yeah. Yeah, much cooler.

04:49.040 --> 04:50.473
Listen, our name is Bundy.

04:50.720 --> 04:55.111
Yeah, B-U-N-D and sometimes Y.

04:55.360 --> 04:56.952
Oh, listen, Mrs. Bundy.

04:57.200 --> 05:00.192
You have just won
first-class accommodations...

05:00.400 --> 05:03.472
...on our luxury cruise
to the Caribbean.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.674
How come only she won?

05:09.920 --> 05:14.710
<i>Because she wrote the most inspiring
essay for New Widows magazine.</i>

05:15.840 --> 05:17.956
New widows, Peg?

05:18.800 --> 05:21.109
So you do share my dream.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.508
But, you know, I don't wanna
go on a cruise by myself.

05:25.720 --> 05:26.675
Hey, Mr. Wolfman...

05:26.880 --> 05:30.031
...don't you think you could just
bend the rules so that Al can come?

05:30.280 --> 05:31.952
- No!
- Please?

05:32.160 --> 05:34.799
This man is unimpeachable,
his character beyond reproach.

05:35.040 --> 05:39.033
He combines the best qualities
of both wolf and man.

05:40.760 --> 05:41.988
There's 50 bucks for you.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.873
Sold. I tell you what,
I'll take this first-class ticket...

05:45.080 --> 05:47.036
...and I'll change it in
for two economies.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.838
Peg, I don't wanna go on a cruise.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.230
All that rocking up and down,
side to side.

05:51.440 --> 05:52.873
I'll be throwing up all night.

05:54.160 --> 05:57.072
And then there's the motion
of the boat.

05:59.800 --> 06:02.030
Wow, a Caribbean cruise.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.111
- Sounds romantic.
- Oh, it is.

06:04.320 --> 06:07.118
- Al must hate it.
- He does.

06:08.480 --> 06:10.232
Oh, it sounds like such fun.

06:10.480 --> 06:12.869
I wish Jefferson and I could
do something like that.

06:13.080 --> 06:16.356
Maybe I could trade these two tickets
for four less-expensive ones.

06:18.680 --> 06:22.798
- Do you think they'd do that?
- Well, let's find out.

06:23.920 --> 06:25.831
Mr. Man?

06:30.840 --> 06:33.957
Do you think that you could trade
these two really good tickets...

06:34.160 --> 06:36.116
...for four just-okay ones?

06:36.360 --> 06:40.069
Hey, anything's possible.
You got 50 bucks?

06:40.880 --> 06:44.077
- Marcie?
- Oh, why not?

06:44.320 --> 06:48.313
You know, if I don't spend it,
Jefferson will.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.475
- Here.
- Here you go.

06:57.120 --> 07:01.193
"Sub-subeconomy class."

07:02.160 --> 07:04.879
I wonder what that is?

07:11.520 --> 07:13.954
Well, the love barge.

07:15.280 --> 07:19.068
- Thanks for bringing me, Peg.
- Oh, it's not so bad.

07:19.320 --> 07:22.357
<i>No, it's like
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea...</i>

07:22.600 --> 07:25.831
...except I'm married
to the giant squid.

07:30.680 --> 07:34.389
- Why must you always be so negative?
- Why did you cross the road?

07:42.800 --> 07:44.836
All right, so the room's
a little cramped.

07:45.080 --> 07:47.116
Most of the time
we're gonna be up on deck...

07:47.320 --> 07:50.278
...eating, dancing,
living the good life.

07:50.520 --> 07:53.273
- So who's the entertainment?
- Gilbert Gottfried.

07:57.440 --> 08:00.671
Besides, who cares about the room?
This is a singles cruise.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.996
That means wall-to-wall women...

08:03.240 --> 08:08.268
...who will be sunning themselves
with their tops unfastened.

08:12.920 --> 08:14.478
What are you guys laughing at?

08:14.680 --> 08:16.796
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

08:17.440 --> 08:21.433
We're just happy to be here
with the women we love.

08:21.880 --> 08:23.916
And you guys.

08:25.840 --> 08:30.391
Well, I'm just glad you're looking
on the bright side of things.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.832
Me too, Peg. In fact, I can't remember
when I've been so happy.

08:34.080 --> 08:37.868
Hi, and welcome to Cruise Light,
the high-fun, low-fat vacation...

08:38.080 --> 08:40.035
...for women who want to watch
the whales...

08:40.240 --> 08:42.434
...instead of being mistaken
for them.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.436
Now, wait a second.

08:49.640 --> 08:52.677
Now, you're telling me
that every passenger on this ship is--

08:52.920 --> 08:55.070
How can I put this?

08:55.320 --> 08:58.357
--an island unto herself?

09:01.640 --> 09:03.073
Well, maybe now.

09:03.280 --> 09:05.748
But by the time we're done
with our deprivation diet...

09:06.000 --> 09:11.916
...and non-stop exercise program,
we'll look as beautiful as those two.

09:17.280 --> 09:19.236
What two?

09:24.280 --> 09:27.511
She means us, poop deck.

09:28.280 --> 09:30.396
Oh, my God,
she does mean the wives.

09:30.640 --> 09:35.031
Jefferson, we're on the voyage
of the damned.

09:43.720 --> 09:47.713
Why didn't you tell me
this was a cruise for fat women?

09:49.960 --> 09:53.270
Because you didn't ask me.
Well, I gotta go.

09:53.480 --> 09:56.358
I'm getting my hair done for free
by Mr. Maurice.

09:56.560 --> 10:00.758
- You know who that is?
- A man with a lot of cats?

10:01.600 --> 10:04.831
No. He is the stylist to the stars.

10:05.080 --> 10:07.275
Who do you think
does Sandra Bernhard's hair?

10:07.520 --> 10:09.351
Ray Charles?

10:14.120 --> 10:16.953
- Let's go, Peggy.
- We should've left them at home.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.714
Should've left us at the altar.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.717
Hey, Al, you know what I'm thinking?

10:26.480 --> 10:29.517
How long it'd take us to swim home
from here?

10:31.480 --> 10:34.870
- Don't answer that. That's a trap.
- What kind of trap?

10:35.080 --> 10:36.991
They say, "Yoo-hoo,"
you open the door...

10:37.200 --> 10:39.236
...they slap two pieces of bread
around you...

10:39.440 --> 10:41.271
...and you're never heard from again.

10:42.160 --> 10:44.071
Hello, is there anyone in there?

10:44.880 --> 10:47.519
I don't know. She sounds thin.
I'm gonna open it.

10:56.280 --> 11:00.034
- Hi, my name's Gretchen.
- Hi, my name's--

11:00.240 --> 11:02.196
Wait a second,
I can't remember my name.

11:02.400 --> 11:05.949
- Quick, Al, what's my name?
- Captain No-Nads.

11:09.800 --> 11:13.952
You two are very funny.
Are either of you Gilbert Gottfried?

11:14.200 --> 11:16.077
- He is.
- He is.

11:16.320 --> 11:19.835
Well, I wanted to find out if either
of you will be taking aerobics classes.

11:20.040 --> 11:21.439
- You taking them?
- I'm teaching.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.278
We're taking them.

11:27.520 --> 11:33.390
Excuse me, Gretchen, but I thought
that all the passengers were...

11:34.280 --> 11:36.111
...Jurassic.

11:39.360 --> 11:42.432
I mean jolly.

11:42.640 --> 11:44.312
May I share something with you?

11:44.520 --> 11:47.239
Sure. Jefferson,
would you step outside?

11:47.960 --> 11:50.633
What I meant was, since you're
not part of the diet group...

11:50.840 --> 11:53.400
...you can participate
in our after-hours activities.

11:54.640 --> 11:57.916
What kind of after-hour activities?

11:58.160 --> 12:00.720
Well, after our 6:30 roundup
and lockdown...

12:00.920 --> 12:02.717
...for our larger passengers...

12:02.960 --> 12:06.191
...we put away the celery
and those disgusting, chalky shakes...

12:06.400 --> 12:10.075
...and bring out the real food.
Tonight is Carnival:

12:10.320 --> 12:13.312
"Couscous
and clothing-optional lambada."

12:22.680 --> 12:25.399
Jefferson, I'm dreaming. Pinch me.

12:30.600 --> 12:31.874
I said, pinch me!

12:42.840 --> 12:45.149
Now, let me get this straight.

12:46.520 --> 12:51.196
At 6:30, you herd all the buffaloes
back to their cells...

12:52.280 --> 12:53.838
...you lock them up...

12:54.040 --> 12:58.352
...and then a wild orgy
of scantily clad crew and us...

12:58.560 --> 12:59.788
...take over the ship?

13:00.040 --> 13:02.270
Right. Is that okay?

13:03.880 --> 13:07.839
Yes. That's fine.

13:09.040 --> 13:13.670
- Thank you.
- Great. I'll see you guys there.

13:18.320 --> 13:20.515
You know the trouble
with rock 'n' roll today?

13:20.720 --> 13:23.029
Took out the bubble machine?

13:25.680 --> 13:27.671
Mr. Jack-Man...

13:30.040 --> 13:32.873
...it's not that we haven't enjoyed
your cute little stories...

13:33.080 --> 13:36.993
...about things that happened
even before Dick Clark was born...

13:38.240 --> 13:39.958
...but you've been here for a week.

13:40.200 --> 13:41.633
I mean...

13:42.200 --> 13:46.796
...shouldn't you be out cruising
with the ho-dads or the ho-moms...

13:47.000 --> 13:50.834
...or whatever ho's you guys
run around with?

13:56.400 --> 14:00.916
There's a lot more to Wolfman Jack
than just, "Hi, here's your prize."

14:01.160 --> 14:05.870
You ever listen to Wolfman Jack on
the radio live from Planet Hollywood?

14:09.880 --> 14:13.236
Look, whatever he says,
just say yes.

14:14.200 --> 14:16.031
Yes.

14:16.240 --> 14:19.118
I also wrote a book,
my autobiography.

14:19.360 --> 14:21.555
Would you like me to read you
a little bit of it?

14:29.840 --> 14:33.469
- Yes.
- You're the best.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.111
Oh, Al.

14:42.280 --> 14:45.670
This is the best vacation
I have ever been on.

14:45.920 --> 14:47.558
Thank you.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.910
You beaked me!

14:57.720 --> 15:01.838
- Have you been drinking?
- Not since I had a drink.

15:02.640 --> 15:07.031
- What do you want?
- Oh, Al, it is amazing out there.

15:07.280 --> 15:08.713
The women may be huge...

15:08.920 --> 15:14.313
...but the male crew can swab my deck
any time.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.589
Well, that shouldn't take long.

15:20.600 --> 15:25.037
- Where's Peg?
- Oh, she's still getting her hair done.

15:25.920 --> 15:29.071
But I don't know why...

15:29.320 --> 15:33.393
...because it always looks
really silly.

15:37.040 --> 15:39.634
Don't tell Al.

15:43.440 --> 15:45.158
Anyway, Al...

15:45.400 --> 15:50.599
...at 6:30, I am going back upstairs
for aqua aerobics.

15:50.840 --> 15:54.037
The male crew members
are gonna pretend to be dolphins...

15:54.280 --> 15:57.750
...and I get to pet their dorsal fins.

16:00.240 --> 16:02.913
And vice versa.

16:06.440 --> 16:07.714
Don't tell Jefferson.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.876
Marcie, did you happen to notice...

16:11.080 --> 16:14.595
...if any of the female crew members
are gonna pretend to be dolphins?

16:16.360 --> 16:19.875
No. I think they're gonna
be mermaids...

16:20.080 --> 16:24.835
...or whatever it is you call it
when you swim around topless.

16:27.400 --> 16:30.597
I better go see
what's keeping Peggy.

16:35.720 --> 16:40.510
Heigh-ho, Flipper, away!

16:51.440 --> 16:56.514
- Are you ready to roll, buddy?
- Ten seconds till lockdown.

16:57.240 --> 17:02.553
- Five, four, three, two, one.
- Five, four, three, two, one.

17:29.080 --> 17:31.833
It's samba time.

17:52.640 --> 17:55.996
Well, Al, what do you think?

17:57.920 --> 18:00.070
About what, Peg?

18:01.040 --> 18:04.794
- My hair.
- Oh, your hair. Oh, it's...

18:06.560 --> 18:08.516
Fine, Peg.

18:10.320 --> 18:12.390
If you're Lyle Lovett.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.478
Shut up.

18:15.720 --> 18:19.679
No, no, he said that, "Al love it."

18:21.080 --> 18:23.878
- You ready to go, Peg?
- Yeah, I guess.

18:24.080 --> 18:27.197
Well, it's kind of cool up there,
you better wear a bag.

18:28.280 --> 18:30.555
A hat, a hat, I meant a hat.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.394
I can't go out in public like this.

18:33.600 --> 18:36.637
No, I know you can't, sweetheart.
I know you can't--

18:36.840 --> 18:38.910
- Come on, Jefferson.
- You can't go either.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.594
Why? My hair don't look like crap!

18:41.840 --> 18:44.752
Oh, what's the matter now, Peg?

18:45.840 --> 18:49.355
Why don't I just go check things out.
You just call me if you need me, okay?

18:49.560 --> 18:52.836
- I need you, I need you!
- Oh, hold me, Al.

18:53.080 --> 18:55.640
I wanna go to the party!

19:59.200 --> 20:01.839
You don't mind staying in with me,
do you, Al?

20:02.040 --> 20:04.349
No.

20:04.560 --> 20:09.588
I'd much rather be in here
than up there in a Russ Meyer movie.

20:10.720 --> 20:14.235
Good, because I am never
leaving this room.

20:24.840 --> 20:28.594
- Al?
- What?

20:29.480 --> 20:31.198
Make love to me.

20:31.440 --> 20:34.432
Why? I didn't screw up your hair!

20:37.400 --> 20:39.789
It's just that I feel so unattractive...

20:40.040 --> 20:43.237
...especially with those aerobics girls
bouncing around up there.

20:43.480 --> 20:46.756
I know you'd rather be on deck
rather than staying in here with me...

20:46.960 --> 20:49.155
...and I really do appreciate it.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.834
You know, Al,
I know that I don't say it very much...

20:52.040 --> 20:54.952
...but you are a great guy.

20:55.160 --> 20:56.957
Al?

21:02.200 --> 21:04.634
Smell that salt-hallway air.

21:06.080 --> 21:08.310
Fine. If you'd rather be up there
partying...

21:08.520 --> 21:11.637
...while your wife is here,
who needs you, just go right ahead.

21:11.880 --> 21:12.949
Thanks. Bye.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.800
- We're going down!
- What, you mean the party's moved?

21:18.040 --> 21:20.713
No, the ship is sinking!

21:20.920 --> 21:23.309
One of the fat women
smelled the jerk chicken...

21:23.520 --> 21:26.239
...and tried to cut through the floor
with a blowtorch!

21:26.440 --> 21:30.149
- Oh, my God, we're really sinking?
- Come on.

21:30.360 --> 21:33.830
If we were really sinking, you think
I could look in this porthole and see--?

21:34.840 --> 21:37.308
Fish!

21:37.560 --> 21:40.552
Oh, my God, we're going to die!

21:40.800 --> 21:44.713
<i>Thank you, Peg,
for booking me on the Titanic!</i>
