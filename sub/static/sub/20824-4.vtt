WEBVTT

00:00.121 --> 00:01.588
You know, I think all we're saying is,

00:01.623 --> 00:04.445
we wanna start making family
decisions in a different way.

00:04.446 --> 00:06.213
Well, every other idea you had was crap.

00:06.248 --> 00:08.348
Not to us, you know, but we
still had to suck it up.

00:08.383 --> 00:10.117
You can't expect to still be...

00:10.152 --> 00:11.384
Oh, I'm the boss, all right.

00:11.420 --> 00:13.289
I would like the entry codes

00:13.290 --> 00:16.085
and the account passwords
changed, please.

00:16.085 --> 00:18.362
Right, which codes can
we change for you today?

00:18.363 --> 00:18.926
All of them.

00:18.961 --> 00:20.961
And they wanna hit this
church... New Canticle.

00:20.996 --> 00:23.430
- Like the megachurch?
- We're here about the AC unit.

00:23.465 --> 00:24.798
We voted. We're doing it.

00:24.834 --> 00:26.433
You know, if this is how
this is gonna work,

00:26.468 --> 00:27.801
then I'm done. I'll do my own jobs, man.

00:27.837 --> 00:29.737
Javi, you were 10 years old.

00:29.772 --> 00:32.539
You told him to throw me out

00:32.573 --> 00:34.274
like I was a piece of trash!

00:34.309 --> 00:37.144
- You are fearless.
- Like you.

Damn it, Smurf.

03:31.736 --> 03:34.637
No, no need to send anyone.
It was a false alarm.

03:34.672 --> 03:37.806
I took care of it. Thank you.

03:40.511 --> 03:43.646
Hey, baby. I looked in
your room this morning.

03:43.681 --> 03:46.214
- Where were you so early?
- I went for a run.

03:46.250 --> 03:48.183
Oh, then you are not leaving the house

03:48.218 --> 03:52.187
without eating something.

03:52.222 --> 03:53.789
Is...

03:53.824 --> 03:56.124
is Lena okay?

03:56.160 --> 03:58.961
Yeah. I'm just lettin' her
sleep in a little bit.

03:58.996 --> 04:01.564
Yeah, I heard her crying.

04:01.599 --> 04:03.032
She having nightmares?

04:03.067 --> 04:06.635
All kids have nightmares.

04:06.671 --> 04:09.572
Hey.

04:11.508 --> 04:14.476
You look like you slept like a baby.

04:15.580 --> 04:18.346
I'm just curious about something.

04:18.382 --> 04:19.848
When you let Craig in,

04:19.884 --> 04:21.684
does he come in through the window

04:21.719 --> 04:24.352
or do you open the front door for him?

04:24.388 --> 04:27.856
Window.

04:27.892 --> 04:31.426
Use the front door from now on.

04:32.763 --> 04:35.497
I'm gonna go wake up Lena. There you go.

04:43.268 --> 04:46.475
So, are you taking trigonometry?

04:46.510 --> 04:49.144
Yeah. Third period.

04:49.179 --> 04:50.679
Yeah, it's such a bitch.

04:50.715 --> 04:53.415
I hope whoever invented
it died a horrible death.

05:00.324 --> 05:02.190
It's Craig.

05:02.226 --> 05:04.860
I gotta go. Bye.

05:07.531 --> 05:10.966
Come on, sleepyhead. Hop up.

05:11.002 --> 05:12.367
Where's Nicky?

05:12.402 --> 05:14.903
Oh, she just left with Craig.

05:16.974 --> 05:18.340
I wanna show you something

05:18.375 --> 05:21.243
after I drop Lena off at school today.

05:21.343 --> 05:22.405
This morning?

05:24.448 --> 05:26.414
You can miss a few classes.

05:26.816 --> 05:28.817
I have something.

05:28.853 --> 05:30.385
Cancel it.

05:30.420 --> 05:33.122
I can't.

05:33.157 --> 05:35.490
But I can do this afternoon.

05:36.593 --> 05:39.261
Did you have fun in the diner in Arizona?

05:39.296 --> 05:41.030
Yeah.

05:44.334 --> 05:47.102
Think you're ready for another job?

05:47.138 --> 05:48.904
Definitely.

05:53.210 --> 05:55.343
What's up, man?

05:55.379 --> 05:56.745
You said you were comin' in early.

05:56.781 --> 05:59.281
It is early.

05:59.316 --> 06:02.685
Yo, man, I got lost. You need to
put a... sign up on the place.

06:02.720 --> 06:05.187
No. No sign. It's cooler that way.

06:05.222 --> 06:07.690
Oh, it's cooler when people
can't find the place?

06:07.725 --> 06:09.558
Can you help me with these kegs, please?

06:12.663 --> 06:14.229
You sure this place is ready to open?

06:14.264 --> 06:17.432
It looks like it needs some more work.
Like... a lot.

06:17.467 --> 06:19.902
No, I don't want it to look polished.

06:19.937 --> 06:22.404
Well, mission accomplished.

06:22.439 --> 06:25.140
Hey, I think it looks awesome.

06:25.176 --> 06:27.009
What time do you want me
to come over tonight?

06:27.044 --> 06:29.812
- I can help you set up. -No, I'm sorry.
You can't come.

06:29.847 --> 06:31.413
Why not?

06:31.448 --> 06:33.082
Do you want me to get shut down?

06:33.117 --> 06:34.349
She's got a fake ID.

06:34.384 --> 06:36.484
-No. -Yo, man, that's bullshit.

06:36.520 --> 06:39.421
If she's not coming, neither am I.

06:39.456 --> 06:42.958
Okay. Then don't come.

06:42.993 --> 06:44.492
Whatever.

06:44.528 --> 06:46.095
I got shit to do.

06:46.130 --> 06:47.495
You sure? Yeah.

06:47.531 --> 06:48.864
Come on, I'll go call you an Uber.

06:48.899 --> 06:51.433
- Not cool, man.
- Just hurry up, okay?

06:51.468 --> 06:54.036
We gotta hit San Onofre and start
drumming up some business.

06:56.240 --> 06:57.906
Hi, Craig.

06:59.710 --> 07:02.410
New bartender.

07:14.258 --> 07:16.091
Do you need any help?

07:17.928 --> 07:21.096
Yeah. A lot.

07:21.132 --> 07:22.564
Okay. What's the occasion?

07:22.599 --> 07:24.733
First date.

07:24.769 --> 07:28.170
Well... it's our first time alone.

07:28.205 --> 07:29.738
We... we met before.

07:29.774 --> 07:32.274
Okay, well, then we definitely
need to find the perfect shirt.

07:32.309 --> 07:34.276
Do you have a designer you like?

07:34.311 --> 07:36.912
No.

07:36.947 --> 07:38.513
Are you looking for French cuffs?

07:38.548 --> 07:41.016
- No, just regular cuffs is fine.
- Okay, got it.

07:41.051 --> 07:42.885
Well, this lavender one

07:42.920 --> 07:46.021
would go great with your skin tone.

07:46.056 --> 07:47.522
Are you shitting me?

07:47.557 --> 07:49.024
No. Try it on.

07:49.059 --> 07:52.527
Oh, wait. Do you know your neck size?

07:52.562 --> 07:54.362
No. Is that bad?

07:54.398 --> 07:57.632
We'll measure it. Stay here.
I'll go get the tape.

08:18.722 --> 08:20.689
What's up, Baz?

08:20.724 --> 08:22.691
I couldn't get the tools.

08:22.726 --> 08:24.960
What happened to the warehouse?

08:24.995 --> 08:27.562
Smurf happened.

08:33.602 --> 08:36.238
I thought you were with Craig.

08:36.273 --> 08:39.073
No.

08:39.109 --> 08:42.845
I... I need to study.

08:46.116 --> 08:49.184
Has Craig ever had a girlfriend?

08:49.220 --> 08:51.954
Define "girlfriend."

08:51.989 --> 08:54.522
Like someone he doesn't screw around on.

08:54.558 --> 08:58.093
I mean, he was checking out
this skank at Deran's bar.

08:58.128 --> 09:00.462
It was... Oh, shit.

09:00.497 --> 09:02.097
I really wasn't supposed to say anything.

09:02.132 --> 09:04.233
Please don't tell Deran.

09:07.137 --> 09:12.040
Nicky, what is it you want from Craig?

09:13.643 --> 09:15.410
I don't know.

09:15.445 --> 09:18.247
Yeah, you do.

09:23.120 --> 09:25.354
To party, I guess.

09:25.389 --> 09:27.222
He's gorgeous.

09:27.258 --> 09:29.491
And he always has blow.

09:30.219 --> 09:32.727
So sex and drugs. That's it?

09:38.802 --> 09:42.271
Do you have any idea
how powerful you are?

09:44.808 --> 09:47.642
You know what that power is?

09:49.246 --> 09:53.949
It's the one thing you
have that every man wants.

09:56.987 --> 10:01.356
You just have to let them
think they have the power,

10:01.392 --> 10:03.926
but they never do, never,

10:03.961 --> 10:06.228
unless you give it to them.

10:07.998 --> 10:10.832
And don't ever give it to them.

10:12.469 --> 10:14.970
So it's... it's just about sex?

10:15.005 --> 10:19.474
I think you can do a little better.

10:19.509 --> 10:20.809
With Craig?

10:20.844 --> 10:22.945
With every man.

10:24.181 --> 10:28.016
You just have to decide what you want.

10:28.052 --> 10:31.253
So what do you want, Nicky?

10:32.787 --> 10:35.090
You want a hint, baby?

10:38.734 --> 10:41.229
Everything.

10:41.265 --> 10:44.166
You take everything.

10:50.631 --> 10:53.258
Why can't Smurf just wash the
clothes Lena already has?

10:53.259 --> 10:55.026
- I don't get it.
- I'm just the messenger, man.

10:55.061 --> 10:56.821
Oh, you are? Well, then tell her

10:56.822 --> 10:58.767
thanks for changing the
security codes on me,

10:58.768 --> 11:00.801
and I want my goddamn
tools from the warehouse.

11:00.837 --> 11:02.102
Tell her that.

11:02.137 --> 11:05.005
You know, Lena's been having nightmares.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.274
- Did she ask you to tell me that, too?
- No.

11:07.309 --> 11:09.276
Well, then, I don't
need a messenger, okay?

11:09.311 --> 11:13.381
Just do the job I'm asking you to do.

11:15.050 --> 11:18.118
I did a job with Smurf.

11:18.153 --> 11:20.421
Were you a lookout while
Smurf tunneled into a bank?

11:20.456 --> 11:22.122
No, it was a diner.

11:22.157 --> 11:24.658
We... didn't get much,

11:24.694 --> 11:28.396
but it was more for fun, so...

11:30.500 --> 11:33.868
What are you telling me? You
and Smurf ripped off a diner?

11:33.903 --> 11:36.069
I can do more.

11:36.105 --> 11:38.105
All right? I'm ready.

11:38.140 --> 11:40.941
Let me do this one.

11:42.512 --> 11:45.078
Get in the car.

12:06.436 --> 12:08.001
So Marla's old place with the mermaids?

12:08.037 --> 12:09.403
- Yeah, that's the one. Yeah.
- Yeah, sweet, sweet.

12:09.439 --> 12:11.004
- I'll try to make it tonight, man.
- All right, bro.

12:11.040 --> 12:12.673
- Right on.
- Yo... free pitcher

12:12.708 --> 12:15.075
if you bring a broken board!

12:15.110 --> 12:17.678
Hey. Yo, you hit everyone by the cars?

12:17.713 --> 12:19.112
Vic and Benny said they'd come,

12:19.148 --> 12:20.714
but they're constantly high
as shit and unreliable,

12:20.750 --> 12:22.983
so I don't know. What's up
with Sean? Is he comin'?

12:23.018 --> 12:24.919
All it took was free beer.

12:24.954 --> 12:26.787
You know I'm actually trying to
make money at this bar, right?

12:26.823 --> 12:28.456
You said you wanted broken boards.

12:28.491 --> 12:31.058
Okay, but how much beer are you offering?

12:31.093 --> 12:33.026
Maybe you should get some more kegs.

12:33.062 --> 12:35.429
- Unbelievable.
- What? You don't like it?

12:35.465 --> 12:37.297
Why don't you ask your...
friends at Surfline

12:37.333 --> 12:39.366
and see if they'll give you a
cheap rate to get an ad, huh?

12:39.401 --> 12:41.001
No. Word of mouth is cooler. Okay?

12:41.036 --> 12:43.203
Hey, you know what's not cool?
An empty bar, bro. It's sad.

12:43.238 --> 12:45.172
Okay, no shit. I get it.

12:45.207 --> 12:47.040
You know, man, we should get going.

12:47.076 --> 12:49.042
The later we are, the bitchier Baz gets.

12:49.078 --> 12:50.578
I'm not going. I'm not going.

12:50.613 --> 12:52.480
I thought I was the one that
didn't wanna do the job.

12:52.515 --> 12:55.983
No, I'm doing the job. I'm
just... I got shit to do.

12:56.018 --> 12:57.283
I'm gonna tell Smurf.

12:57.284 --> 13:00.253
- About the bar?
- Yeah.

13:00.289 --> 13:02.055
Can't wait to see the look on her face.

13:02.091 --> 13:03.958
Think she'll lose her shit?

13:03.993 --> 13:06.426
I hope so.

13:10.265 --> 13:12.165
- Where are the other two?
- Not here.

13:12.201 --> 13:14.668
Wallace said we could
stay as long as we need,

13:14.704 --> 13:16.303
but it wasn't cheap.

13:21.544 --> 13:23.043
Hey, where's Deran?

13:23.078 --> 13:25.813
- He's not here?
- Don't bullshit me.

13:25.848 --> 13:28.649
No. We can't wait all day.

13:28.684 --> 13:29.950
I'll do it.

13:29.986 --> 13:31.919
You'll do what?

13:31.954 --> 13:33.621
This. I can do it.

13:34.957 --> 13:38.225
All right, yeah. You're
gonna have to get in there.

14:11.326 --> 14:12.117
We good?

14:16.933 --> 14:18.532
You sure about J?

14:18.568 --> 14:20.901
I mean, you wanna lose him to Smurf?

14:20.937 --> 14:22.269
If Deran keeps going AWOL,

14:22.304 --> 14:24.538
we're gonna need J more than he needs us.

14:28.210 --> 14:30.243
How long we gotta be
in this goddamn thing?

14:30.279 --> 14:31.779
Don't know. It could be hours.

14:31.814 --> 14:33.447
Roomy in there?

14:33.482 --> 14:34.648
Kiss my ass!

14:34.684 --> 14:37.517
Let's see how long you can last.

14:52.234 --> 14:53.901
I bought a bar.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.571
I know.

15:07.049 --> 15:08.415
There's an office in the back.

15:08.450 --> 15:11.585
It's big enough for me to stay in, so...

15:11.621 --> 15:14.254
I'm gonna stay there. I'm
gonna leave your apartment.

15:14.289 --> 15:17.257
I already started packing stuff up, so...

15:22.197 --> 15:24.832
Are you mad?

15:26.268 --> 15:28.368
Do you want me to be?

15:35.077 --> 15:38.311
Well, I'm opening the bar tonight, so...

15:43.119 --> 15:45.185
Do you wanna come?

15:47.156 --> 15:49.657
Of course I would.

16:00.136 --> 16:03.904
Man, I can't breathe.

16:03.939 --> 16:05.438
I'm sweating my balls off.

16:07.172 --> 16:09.442
Yo, turn down the blower!

16:09.478 --> 16:11.344
When did Craig turn into such a pussy?

16:11.380 --> 16:13.113
I'm not hearing anything from J.

16:13.149 --> 16:15.315
Maybe he passed out.

16:15.753 --> 16:17.918
Turn the goddamn blower down!

16:17.953 --> 16:19.319
Man up!

16:21.891 --> 16:24.424
Look, can you breathe?

16:25.486 --> 16:27.094
I can't.

16:28.664 --> 16:31.231
How much can you sweat till
you lose consciousness?

16:32.568 --> 16:34.434
Screw this, man. I'm done.

16:40.127 --> 16:41.508
Craig, come...

16:41.543 --> 16:42.910
You're not seriously leaving, are you?

16:42.945 --> 16:45.545
I told you that I didn't
wanna do this job!

16:45.581 --> 16:47.781
Stop! I'm not asking. Stop!

16:47.817 --> 16:49.183
I'm out! That's it!

16:53.422 --> 16:56.256
Looks like you got the job.

17:06.268 --> 17:08.501
- Where the hell were you?
- I'm busy, man.

17:08.537 --> 17:10.537
No, no, not busy. Not good enough.
Where were you?

17:10.571 --> 17:12.005
Look, I already do all the shit work.

17:12.040 --> 17:13.540
I don't need to practice it, okay?

17:13.575 --> 17:15.142
Okay, look, if you wanna surf,
you surf on your own time.

17:15.176 --> 17:16.844
You got it?

17:16.878 --> 17:19.378
I bought a bar.

17:19.414 --> 17:21.848
What do you mean, you bought a bar?

17:21.884 --> 17:24.384
On Wisconsin and Tremont.

17:24.419 --> 17:26.252
The one with all the mermaids with the...

17:26.288 --> 17:28.021
- with the tits?
- Yeah.

17:28.057 --> 17:30.858
Smurf let you buy a bar?

17:30.893 --> 17:33.093
I didn't ask for her permission.

17:33.129 --> 17:35.829
Okay. So what, no more jobs?

17:35.865 --> 17:37.597
I'm doing the job.

17:37.633 --> 17:41.034
Okay, well, then when I
call a meeting, you come.

18:08.297 --> 18:09.963
It's nice to see you finally brought

18:09.999 --> 18:12.299
your daughter some clothes.

18:12.334 --> 18:14.501
You changed the codes on me.

18:14.536 --> 18:16.837
It's not your business, is it?

18:21.476 --> 18:23.110
Smurf, I want my jackhammers.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.712
- No idea what you're talkin' about.
- Oh, cut the shit.

18:25.747 --> 18:28.248
My tools are the in warehouse.
I need them.

18:28.284 --> 18:31.584
Actually, are you sure I
didn't pay for those tools?

18:31.620 --> 18:33.187
You want me to dig up the receipts?

18:33.222 --> 18:35.155
- I do.
- Okay.

18:35.191 --> 18:36.556
What's the new code?

18:36.591 --> 18:39.092
I wouldn't want you to
take the wrong stuff.

18:39.128 --> 18:41.895
We'll have to figure out
a time when we can meet.

18:41.931 --> 18:45.632
I need the tools this week.
What's the new code?

18:45.667 --> 18:48.368
Why? You pulling a job?

18:48.403 --> 18:50.103
Oh, that's right. The church.

18:50.139 --> 18:52.172
What are you gonna hit next time?
An orphanage?

18:52.208 --> 18:54.741
Oh, my God. You're one to talk.

18:54.776 --> 18:56.043
A diner?

18:56.078 --> 18:59.012
The kid's too green to know
you're gonna get him hurt.

18:59.048 --> 19:01.448
J's a big boy.

19:02.885 --> 19:04.384
How's the commune going?

19:04.419 --> 19:06.453
No commune. I'm in charge.

19:06.488 --> 19:10.057
You're so full of shit.

19:10.092 --> 19:13.760
The only person those
boys hate more than me

19:13.795 --> 19:15.229
is you.

19:15.264 --> 19:18.498
God, that is such bullshit.

19:18.533 --> 19:21.902
I trained you, Baz.

19:21.937 --> 19:24.238
You are me.

20:13.097 --> 20:16.223
- Hey!
- Sayonara, bitches.

20:19.995 --> 20:21.761
What the hell?!

20:33.270 --> 20:35.836
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:36.804 --> 20:37.531
Sorry.

20:39.021 --> 20:41.855
I-I like your shirt.

20:41.891 --> 20:43.423
It's lavender.

20:48.591 --> 20:51.225
I hope you like Mexican food.

20:53.729 --> 20:55.296
Did I mess up?

20:55.331 --> 20:58.866
No. I-I love Mexican.

20:58.902 --> 21:01.669
When I told you about my son.

21:01.704 --> 21:04.906
I hope that didn't scare you off.

21:04.941 --> 21:06.674
I'm here.

21:06.709 --> 21:11.578
I'd feel dishonest if I didn't tell you.

21:11.614 --> 21:16.450
I've done enough lying in my life.

21:16.485 --> 21:19.287
I'm trying to make better choices.

21:26.762 --> 21:30.898
So what does a property
manager do all day?

21:45.114 --> 21:47.581
Yo.

21:47.616 --> 21:49.350
What the hell is this?

21:49.385 --> 21:52.119
Check it out.

21:52.155 --> 21:54.822
Did you steal this?

21:54.858 --> 21:57.024
Are you crazy?

21:57.060 --> 21:59.626
Crazy good. Yo, help me unload this shit.

21:59.662 --> 22:02.129
No, no. I don't want
any stolen beer, man.

22:02.165 --> 22:03.597
Tastes the same, don't it?

22:03.632 --> 22:06.367
What if this truck has
GPS or something, huh?

22:06.402 --> 22:08.769
Did you think about that
before you jacked it?

22:10.139 --> 22:12.206
Get it the hell out of here, man.

22:14.810 --> 22:16.610
What does Baz mean by "new plan"?

22:16.645 --> 22:19.680
Not my problem. I told him I'm out.
You should, too.

22:19.715 --> 22:21.349
No, I only had enough
money to lease the bar.

22:21.384 --> 22:23.951
I need more to fix it up.

22:25.721 --> 22:27.521
Yo, what do you want me
to do with the truck?

22:27.556 --> 22:29.357
I don't give a shit. Just get rid of it.

22:38.634 --> 22:42.370
Sorry I asked for the check.
I have to get back to work.

22:42.405 --> 22:45.739
I gotta meet up with my brothers.

22:45.775 --> 22:48.575
You okay?

22:48.611 --> 22:50.844
You didn't talk very much.

22:50.880 --> 22:53.747
How do you live with yourself

22:53.783 --> 22:56.683
after what you did to your son?

23:03.960 --> 23:05.859
I've done things...

23:10.699 --> 23:13.667
...that I have to live with somehow.

23:24.180 --> 23:26.880
Okay. I try to do things,

23:26.916 --> 23:29.951
little things, anything,

23:29.986 --> 23:34.588
to show myself that the person
who made those mistakes

23:34.623 --> 23:37.024
isn't who I really am.

23:37.060 --> 23:40.261
Like with your niece.

23:40.296 --> 23:43.497
Where would she be without you?

23:46.102 --> 23:48.669
Lena barely knows me.

23:50.773 --> 23:54.008
I was in prison half her life.

24:26.775 --> 24:29.010
You can tell me anything.

24:31.414 --> 24:36.984
Just next time, you do it at
the beginning of our date.

25:02.011 --> 25:06.447
I know I'm late. Baz stopped by.

25:06.482 --> 25:08.215
By the way, I hear he's not getting along

25:08.251 --> 25:09.583
with your uncles too well.

25:09.618 --> 25:11.519
Oh, yeah. Craig pulled out of the job.

25:11.554 --> 25:13.554
Aw, that's a shame.

25:13.589 --> 25:15.423
So I took his place.

25:16.821 --> 25:18.359
Good.

25:18.394 --> 25:20.394
Give me your phone.

25:20.430 --> 25:22.763
My...

25:22.798 --> 25:24.165
Okay.

25:44.554 --> 25:45.986
Hey.

25:46.021 --> 25:47.821
- What's up?
- Thanks for showing up this time.

25:47.856 --> 25:49.723
Let's make it quick. I got shit to do.

25:49.758 --> 25:52.126
- All right. What, no Craig?
- No.

25:56.566 --> 25:57.898
What's up, man?

25:57.933 --> 25:59.967
- What?
- What are you wearing?

26:00.002 --> 26:02.736
- Yeah, what are you wearing?
- I'm wearing a shirt.

26:04.039 --> 26:07.141
- It's purple.
- Yeah, it's not purple.

26:07.176 --> 26:09.510
Where the hell were you?

26:09.545 --> 26:10.911
I was at Bible study. I was doing my job.

26:10.946 --> 26:12.480
You called a meeting. What do you want?

26:12.515 --> 26:15.048
Okay, look,

26:15.084 --> 26:18.419
Smurf is just waiting for us
to fall on our faces, okay?

26:18.454 --> 26:20.020
And that's exactly what's gonna happen

26:20.055 --> 26:22.823
if the bullshit doesn't end right now.

26:22.858 --> 26:24.891
You could've given us this
lecture over the phone.

26:24.927 --> 26:27.694
My bullshit. My bullshit.

26:29.165 --> 26:32.032
I have been acting like an asshole.

26:32.067 --> 26:36.670
But I'm not Smurf, and I sure
as hell don't wanna be Smurf.

26:36.705 --> 26:39.140
We didn't used to fight
all the time, man.

26:39.175 --> 26:41.808
We used to have fun.

26:41.844 --> 26:43.511
Remember the Wexler Building?

26:43.546 --> 26:44.778
Wexler Building.

26:44.813 --> 26:46.213
Yeah! The balcony.

26:46.249 --> 26:47.948
Now that was the highest
jump we ever did.

26:47.983 --> 26:51.585
No, no. It was the Hyatt pool jump.

26:51.621 --> 26:52.953
That was the highest jump we did.

26:52.988 --> 26:56.624
Okay, well, this one's higher than both.

26:57.085 --> 26:58.025
Shit.

26:58.060 --> 26:59.527
We just have to wait
for the crane operator

26:59.562 --> 27:01.362
to go to lunch.

27:01.397 --> 27:03.897
I'll text Craig.

27:19.382 --> 27:22.650
It's nice, isn't it?

27:22.685 --> 27:25.252
Is this your apartment?

27:25.288 --> 27:26.820
It's one of them.

27:26.855 --> 27:31.124
I hope you didn't think I was
just some sleazy slumlord.

27:32.195 --> 27:35.596
There's a Miss Janice
Browne who pays $4K a month

27:35.631 --> 27:39.633
for this groovy pad.

27:39.669 --> 27:42.670
Is it... is it okay to just walk in?

27:42.705 --> 27:44.705
Of course it is,

27:44.740 --> 27:47.841
because I'm Janice Browne.

27:47.876 --> 27:51.178
She has a lease with a signature,

27:51.214 --> 27:53.414
a Social Security number.

27:53.449 --> 27:55.816
She pays her rent with a money order.

27:55.851 --> 27:58.852
The 1st of every month.

27:58.887 --> 28:01.589
Same as eight of the other bogus tenants

28:01.624 --> 28:04.091
that supposedly live in this building.

28:04.126 --> 28:07.294
So this is how you launder your money.

28:07.330 --> 28:09.996
One of the ways.

28:10.032 --> 28:15.001
You can't deposit stolen
money into a bank, right?

28:15.037 --> 28:19.072
Because bank deposits
are tracked by the IRS.

28:19.108 --> 28:23.310
So you have to set up a
legitimate business.

28:23.346 --> 28:28.215
Now I can clear $32K a month
from this building alone.

28:28.251 --> 28:30.150
There's another $20K

28:30.185 --> 28:33.354
from the shitholes on Mission and Whaley.

28:33.389 --> 28:38.392
And then I have three
houses that I rent out.

28:40.396 --> 28:42.529
For free.

28:42.565 --> 28:45.932
On the books, they bring in $5K.

28:45.968 --> 28:48.802
Why do you rent them out for free?

28:48.837 --> 28:52.439
Let's just say I rent them
for services rendered.

28:52.475 --> 28:55.008
I pay the boys their salary

28:55.043 --> 28:56.977
through the management company...

28:57.012 --> 28:59.846
taxes, Social Security, pension plan,

28:59.882 --> 29:02.115
health insurance, all of it.

29:02.151 --> 29:04.585
We're just another law-abiding family

29:04.620 --> 29:09.657
doing what we can to
contribute to society.

29:12.428 --> 29:14.295
So what's the job?

29:14.330 --> 29:16.863
I just told you.

29:16.899 --> 29:19.166
You want me to help you with the books?

29:19.201 --> 29:22.969
Any idiot with a gun can pull a job.

29:23.005 --> 29:26.039
The ones that last are the
ones that know what to do

29:26.074 --> 29:28.108
with the money once they get it.

29:28.143 --> 29:30.444
My boys never understood that.

29:30.479 --> 29:33.380
All they wanted was action.

29:33.416 --> 29:37.718
Now if that's all you're after,
then you stick with them.

29:39.254 --> 29:42.222
I wanna learn.

29:56.739 --> 29:58.271
Let's go.

29:58.307 --> 30:00.140
Let's go, let's go. Let's go, let's go.

30:39.749 --> 30:41.615
High enough for you guys?

30:41.650 --> 30:44.485
What do you think?

30:44.520 --> 30:46.019
Eight stories?

30:46.054 --> 30:48.655
I'll let you know when
I get to the bottom.

30:54.663 --> 30:57.364
Shit!

31:18.788 --> 31:20.621
How long before the cops get here?

31:21.629 --> 31:24.858
Seven or eight minutes,
if they're not at lunch.

31:24.894 --> 31:26.860
Better hurry, then.

31:48.376 --> 31:51.343
So you gonna run a bar?

31:51.379 --> 31:52.711
You don't think I can?

31:52.747 --> 31:56.415
No, I... No, I didn't say that.

31:56.450 --> 31:59.919
Why didn't you say something?

31:59.954 --> 32:02.121
'Cause I knew you'd give me
shit like you always do.

32:02.157 --> 32:04.056
Maybe I would've been happy for you.

32:04.092 --> 32:06.225
Happy about what?

32:06.261 --> 32:07.760
Deran's bar.

32:07.796 --> 32:09.395
What bar?

32:09.430 --> 32:11.964
Deran bought Marla's place.

32:17.138 --> 32:20.039
Yeah, I actually gotta go open up.

32:20.074 --> 32:22.508
Today was fun, man,

32:22.543 --> 32:25.644
but I'm still not taking your shit.

32:25.680 --> 32:28.714
- And I'm still not doing the job.
- Did I ask you to?

32:28.749 --> 32:31.918
You say you're out, I respect it.

32:31.953 --> 32:35.621
You're right. I do make you do
the shit work a lot of the time.

32:35.656 --> 32:38.825
I do.

32:38.860 --> 32:40.993
So now it's my turn.

32:42.239 --> 32:43.729
What does that mean?

32:43.764 --> 32:46.165
That means I'm taking
your place in the duct.

32:46.201 --> 32:48.467
For a higher cut?

32:48.502 --> 32:51.270
No. We share equally.

32:51.306 --> 32:53.739
I told you. I'm not Smurf.

32:56.344 --> 32:58.477
So we're good?

33:00.048 --> 33:02.281
- Yeah, we're good.
- Good.

33:15.363 --> 33:18.530
Hey. You think this beer's too flat?

33:18.566 --> 33:20.733
No, like the last four times.

33:22.203 --> 33:24.570
I just wanna make sure the
pressure gauge isn't off.

33:24.605 --> 33:27.006
Hey, man, relax. The bar
is gonna fill up, okay?

33:27.041 --> 33:28.741
Yeah. I know.

33:28.776 --> 33:31.911
Holy shit. Where is everybody?

33:31.946 --> 33:34.713
They'll be here just as soon
as it's too dark to surf.

33:34.749 --> 33:36.648
Yeah, well, it's been dark
for over an hour, so...

33:36.684 --> 33:38.584
Took me a while to find the place.

33:38.619 --> 33:40.786
You should think about putting up a sign.

33:40.821 --> 33:43.089
Right? That's what I've been saying.

33:43.124 --> 33:44.323
Here. On the house.

33:44.359 --> 33:47.360
Oh, I paid for that beer.

33:47.395 --> 33:49.762
It cost me 16 grand.

33:50.631 --> 33:52.131
Yo, look who's here.

33:52.166 --> 33:56.135
- What's up?
- Heather, free pitchers for my boys.

33:56.170 --> 33:57.803
Pitcher. I'll get the glasses.

33:57.838 --> 33:59.738
Bro.

34:03.811 --> 34:06.612
- Okay, okay.
- We did it.

34:08.815 --> 34:11.683
What do you guys want?

34:16.891 --> 34:18.224
Studying?

34:18.259 --> 34:20.927
- I'm learning Quicken.
- What's that?

34:21.577 --> 34:23.795
Something for the family.

34:23.831 --> 34:25.998
Money managing, stuff like that.

34:26.034 --> 34:28.034
Smurf has you doing that?

34:28.069 --> 34:29.701
Yeah.

34:30.603 --> 34:32.670
Are you going out?

34:34.742 --> 34:38.143
So are you ready for this midterm?

34:40.047 --> 34:41.914
Well, it was a lot easier

34:41.949 --> 34:44.382
when I could copy off of you.

34:44.418 --> 34:49.255
Finally got Lena to bed.

34:49.290 --> 34:52.623
Try to keep it down, okay?

34:52.659 --> 34:54.360
You look nice.

34:54.395 --> 34:55.928
I do, don't I?

36:23.617 --> 36:25.784
Hey, buddy.

36:25.819 --> 36:26.952
Hey.

36:26.987 --> 36:28.820
You gotta be kiddin' me.

36:28.856 --> 36:31.690
Maybe Deran isn't as much
of a screwup as we thought.

36:31.725 --> 36:34.993
Yeah. It's just the first night, though.

36:36.197 --> 36:41.067
- Where is he?
- Deran! Let's do some shots.

36:44.672 --> 36:46.238
Where's Craig at?

36:47.641 --> 36:51.077
I don't know. I have no idea.

36:51.112 --> 36:53.712
What the hell is the name of this place?

36:54.352 --> 36:56.215
It's The Drop.

36:57.452 --> 36:59.552
- To The Drop.
- To The Drop, yeah.

36:59.587 --> 37:01.653
- Good job, buddy.
- The Drop.

37:21.109 --> 37:22.541
Hey.

37:22.577 --> 37:25.877
Did you do this all yourself, baby?

37:25.913 --> 37:27.580
Yeah.

37:30.084 --> 37:31.883
Proud of you.

37:33.721 --> 37:36.188
That's it? You're leaving already?

37:36.224 --> 37:38.557
-Yeah. -Okay.

37:40.595 --> 37:42.794
You ever plan on seeing Lena again?

37:42.830 --> 37:45.931
She's having nightmares.

37:45.966 --> 37:48.234
What kind of question is that?

38:06.287 --> 38:11.657
It's nice to see you patched
things up with your brothers.

38:11.692 --> 38:13.225
Thanks.

38:13.261 --> 38:15.194
It won't last.

38:18.032 --> 38:21.700
We're never coming back, Smurf.

38:23.437 --> 38:25.638
I didn't ask you to.

38:48.729 --> 38:50.929
Yo, who's in there?

38:50.964 --> 38:53.699
- What's up, man?
- Hey, open up.

38:53.734 --> 38:55.267
What's up, man? You want some coke?

38:55.303 --> 38:56.968
- You remember Callie and...
- What are you doing?

38:57.004 --> 38:59.705
- ...her brother Christian.
- Yeah, no, I don't. Get out.

38:59.740 --> 39:02.308
Get out now! Please. Get out.

39:02.343 --> 39:03.609
Out.

39:03.644 --> 39:05.811
Thank you. Out.

39:07.315 --> 39:09.582
Don't worry, man.

39:09.617 --> 39:10.882
There's plenty left for you here.

39:10.918 --> 39:12.384
No, not in my bar, man. Not in my bar.

39:12.420 --> 39:13.686
Let me see that. Let me see that.

39:13.721 --> 39:15.854
Let me see it.

39:15.889 --> 39:18.457
What are you doing? What are
you... What are you doing?!

39:18.492 --> 39:21.126
Get off of me!

39:21.161 --> 39:23.229
Deran, what is wrong with you?!

39:23.264 --> 39:26.465
What is...

39:26.500 --> 39:28.767
What is wrong with you, huh?!

39:45.620 --> 39:47.253
Let's go somewhere and do more blow.

39:47.288 --> 39:49.622
Deran dumped it all in the toilet.

39:49.657 --> 39:51.624
Agent Orange is playing at The Cove.

39:51.659 --> 39:53.959
You know, I like Agent Orange, but...

39:53.994 --> 39:56.962
You know what? I got a better idea.

41:25.686 --> 41:29.888
So sine is the opposite
side of a hypotenuse.

41:29.923 --> 41:32.858
It's just 4 over s...

41:32.893 --> 41:34.303
What?

41:35.329 --> 41:38.296
Um, you're just... you're
being really nice.

41:38.332 --> 41:41.132
You didn't... you didn't have to help me.

41:42.336 --> 41:45.036
Don't want your dad
hauling you off to Guam.

41:45.691 --> 41:47.172
He doesn't either.

41:47.207 --> 41:48.774
It's not like he put up much of a fight

41:48.809 --> 41:51.610
when I said I wanted to stay.

41:51.645 --> 41:54.613
I thought he wanted you to
finish high school here.

41:57.418 --> 42:00.285
I think he was glad to get rid of me.

42:02.956 --> 42:06.157
He doesn't give a shit.

42:11.331 --> 42:13.565
No, he's... he's not your mom.

42:15.903 --> 42:18.771
He gives a shit.

42:24.077 --> 42:25.811
You hungry?

42:25.846 --> 42:27.204
Yeah.

42:27.882 --> 42:30.849
- Let's take a break.
- Okay.

42:39.344 --> 42:41.560
You sure you don't want
to go to The Cove?

42:41.595 --> 42:43.562
No, I got shit to do.

42:43.597 --> 42:46.165
Hit me up sometime.

42:54.553 --> 42:57.103
_

42:59.580 --> 43:02.948
Hey.

43:02.983 --> 43:04.483
Hey, what are you doing?

43:07.588 --> 43:08.954
Studying.

43:08.989 --> 43:10.756
Screw that. Why don't you come out?

43:10.791 --> 43:13.692
Oh, I thought I wasn't supposed
to set foot in Deran's bar.

43:13.727 --> 43:15.226
Yeah, well, look...

43:15.262 --> 43:16.862
Agent Orange are playing at The Cove.

43:16.897 --> 43:18.497
You wanna roll?

43:30.478 --> 43:34.312
Hey. I gotta go. I forgot
I was meeting somebody.

43:35.401 --> 43:37.449
Cool.

43:39.026 --> 43:41.319
Okay. Bye.

43:41.355 --> 43:42.809
Later.

43:55.028 --> 43:56.394
Deran!

43:56.838 --> 43:59.304
Deran, could use some help.

44:02.410 --> 44:04.943
- What's up?
- He's next.

44:04.979 --> 44:07.980
Oh, shit.

44:08.015 --> 44:09.948
What's up, Adrian?

44:09.984 --> 44:11.617
Bartending?

44:14.154 --> 44:15.654
No, I own the bar.

44:15.690 --> 44:16.889
Wow.

44:16.924 --> 44:19.324
How much did... Smurf
give you to buy the place?

44:19.360 --> 44:23.262
No, it's got nothing to do with her.

44:23.297 --> 44:24.897
Wow.

44:24.932 --> 44:26.465
I would've given you the
news, but, I don't know,

44:26.501 --> 44:27.900
you kind of made it clear

44:27.935 --> 44:31.904
that you didn't wanna hear from me, so...

44:31.939 --> 44:33.539
Anyway, what do you want?
What can I get you?

44:33.574 --> 44:37.943
Speech, speech, speech, speech, speech...

44:37.978 --> 44:40.679
Speech, speech, speech, speech, speech...

44:40.715 --> 44:42.047
Turn down the music!

44:42.082 --> 44:46.151
Speech, speech, speech, speech, speech...

44:46.186 --> 44:47.586
Come on, Deran!

44:47.622 --> 44:50.188
Speech, speech, speech,
speech, speech, speech...

44:52.192 --> 44:53.992
Speech, speech, speech.

44:58.533 --> 45:02.635
Thank you for coming.

45:02.670 --> 45:05.638
It means a lot to me, so...

45:07.909 --> 45:11.343
Shit, I'm sorry. I've never
given a speech before, so...

45:13.213 --> 45:15.481
You got this, dude!

45:15.516 --> 45:17.416
I have something I'd like to say.

45:17.452 --> 45:19.952
I'll take it.

45:22.056 --> 45:25.758
Public speaking never really
was your strong suit, was it?

45:25.793 --> 45:29.695
Remember that time with ESPN?

45:29.730 --> 45:34.266
ESPN wanted to interview Deran
when he won this...

45:34.301 --> 45:37.302
What was it? A rip curl
contest down in Baja?

45:37.338 --> 45:41.073
I swear, the boy was scared shitless.

45:41.108 --> 45:44.743
He was taking down
surfers twice his age...

46:08.903 --> 46:13.906
...nobody, and this bar proves it.

46:13.941 --> 46:16.341
So here's to the runt of my litter,

46:16.377 --> 46:19.277
my beautiful baby boy.

46:19.313 --> 46:20.746
To Deran.

46:20.781 --> 46:22.915
To Deran!

46:44.071 --> 46:46.906
What's going on out here, baby?

46:48.075 --> 46:51.176
You couldn't just let me have even this?

46:51.211 --> 46:53.612
What?

47:02.990 --> 47:05.958
I'm gay.

47:11.398 --> 47:13.198
Sweetheart...

47:18.238 --> 47:20.505
It's gonna be okay, baby.

47:20.541 --> 47:23.408
It's not okay.

47:26.581 --> 47:30.816
'Cause I can't... you.

47:30.851 --> 47:34.186
Isn't that what you want?

47:34.221 --> 47:36.689
To feel like that's what I want?

47:38.059 --> 47:39.959
I guess you're gonna have to see
if Pope and Craig are into it

47:39.994 --> 47:41.961
because, you know, Baz
isn't your real son,

47:41.996 --> 47:43.596
so it makes it less interesting.

47:48.368 --> 47:50.268
You never loved me.

47:52.373 --> 47:54.840
You never loved any of us.

47:57.845 --> 47:59.678
It's all about you.

48:03.317 --> 48:05.283
It's always been about you.

49:24.872 --> 49:27.833
Was hoping you'd still be open.

49:27.868 --> 49:30.335
I'm not. It's after 2 a.m.

49:31.638 --> 49:33.839
Yo, about earlier...

49:34.368 --> 49:37.042
It's all good.

49:37.078 --> 49:38.415
Hey, is it cool if I...

49:38.416 --> 49:39.702
if I'm here?

49:39.703 --> 49:42.715
Yeah.

49:42.750 --> 49:44.042
What's with the broken boards?

49:44.043 --> 49:45.515
He's gonna put 'em up on the wall.

49:45.817 --> 49:50.889
- Why?
- 'Cause that's what it's all about.

49:50.925 --> 49:54.426
Giving up something to
chase something awesome.

49:54.461 --> 49:56.195
Right, bro?

50:03.904 --> 50:05.738
What's with you?

50:17.584 --> 50:20.285
I told her.

50:20.320 --> 50:22.855
Told her what?

50:26.026 --> 50:27.525
Shit, really?

50:33.067 --> 50:36.317
Yeah. Yeah.

50:36.318 --> 50:38.971
And?

50:42.655 --> 50:45.710
I really gave it to her.

50:47.460 --> 50:51.616
I said more than I needed to.

50:51.652 --> 50:53.524
Hey, hey, hey.

50:53.525 --> 50:55.989
Hey, man.

50:57.776 --> 51:00.458
You bought a bar.

51:00.494 --> 51:03.561
And you opened it tonight.

51:05.499 --> 51:09.534
It was lit. People came,
and they loved it.

51:12.435 --> 51:16.408
You need to forget her bullshit.

51:16.443 --> 51:21.280
She knows she had nothing to
do with it and she hates it.

51:23.417 --> 51:26.919
This was all yours. This is all you.

51:26.954 --> 51:29.594
You need to know that.

51:29.595 --> 51:30.635
Okay?

51:35.358 --> 51:39.231
All right. Come on, let's
put some of your boards up.

51:39.584 --> 51:42.701
Nick, can you pass me
the... left board?

51:43.938 --> 51:46.872
Here you go.

51:48.309 --> 51:50.843
Come on, man. I can't do this all alone.

51:54.194 --> 51:55.149
Come on.

52:02.804 --> 52:05.824
You know, that was...

52:05.860 --> 52:09.161
- really good blow that you flushed.
- Oh, come on.

52:09.196 --> 52:11.830
You were snorting it off a toilet seat.

52:11.866 --> 52:14.099
- So?
- That's disgusting.

52:14.134 --> 52:16.368
What do you want me to do with that?

52:16.403 --> 52:18.442
All right, well, next time,
I'll just do it off your bar.

52:18.443 --> 52:19.396
Sure.

52:19.397 --> 52:21.006
I'm done.

52:21.742 --> 52:25.010
Now I gotta clean up all
this shit on the bar, too.

52:28.983 --> 52:30.247
...clean up all this
shit after everybody.
