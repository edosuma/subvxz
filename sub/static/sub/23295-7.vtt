00:59.120 --> 01:02.280
Oh, excellent! Well done, Felicity.
I can tick that off.

01:02.560 --> 01:05.600
It's yarrow root,
another useful thing for potions.

01:05.680 --> 01:09.280
Oh! Look at the state of me!

01:09.360 --> 01:11.640
What's up next?
Who wants to volunteer and get it?

01:12.000 --> 01:14.560
This whole sorry business
has nothing to do with me.

01:14.840 --> 01:17.600
Only Mildred Hubble
could devise a secret competition

01:17.680 --> 01:20.080
that meant we used up all the ingredients.

01:20.480 --> 01:21.720
This is child labour.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.480
Pentangle's wouldn't send
their witches out like this.

01:24.560 --> 01:25.880
And if they did,

01:26.280 --> 01:30.280
they'd send out a proper teacher
to help us, not Miss Mould.

01:30.360 --> 01:32.720
She hasn't a clue about potions.

01:33.280 --> 01:34.640
Maybe that's why HB sent her.

01:35.360 --> 01:37.960
She knew we'd have to do it ourself
like proper witches.

01:38.080 --> 01:39.560
Got some grimly grass!

01:40.520 --> 01:42.920
I don't think that's grimly grass, Mil.

01:43.080 --> 01:45.600
That's egg pong plant, stupid!

01:46.040 --> 01:47.960
- Is that on the list?
- No.

01:48.800 --> 01:49.800
Oh.

01:50.720 --> 01:52.760
So, what's left, apart from grimly grass?

01:53.280 --> 01:56.480
Raven feathers
and mandrake truffles.

01:56.880 --> 01:59.040
Found in... Hollow Wood.

02:02.240 --> 02:04.360
Uh, why all the weird looks?

02:04.440 --> 02:06.040
Don't you know anything?

02:06.320 --> 02:08.800
- Hollow Wood is enchanted.
- Yeah, right.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.919
If you believe it,
you'll believe anything.

02:11.640 --> 02:15.440
- Witches go in there and...
- Never come out again.

02:16.520 --> 02:19.680
HB wouldn't send us anywhere dangerous,
would she?

02:20.320 --> 02:21.880
No, Maud, she wouldn't.

02:22.480 --> 02:25.080
Every witch gets warned
about going into Hollow Wood.

02:26.120 --> 02:28.920
But, of course, you're not a proper witch.

02:29.880 --> 02:30.880
Felicity.

02:32.560 --> 02:34.920
Come on. Don't be such wimps.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.520
It's just a wood!

02:37.200 --> 02:38.200
Wait for me.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.440
Why can't I be out with Mildred and Maud?

02:45.640 --> 02:47.640
Because this is a punishment, Enid.

02:47.720 --> 02:50.400
Miss Hardbroom wants
the second-year ring leaders separated

02:50.480 --> 02:52.720
after last night's potions fiasco.

02:53.080 --> 02:56.760
- Miss Drill, that's not fair!
- So that means you're with me.

02:56.840 --> 02:59.160
Stock checking. Everything.

02:59.560 --> 03:01.080
Come on, it'll be fun.

03:03.160 --> 03:04.480
Kitchen's first.

03:12.760 --> 03:15.000
And that is how you duplicate.

03:16.560 --> 03:20.240
Are there any questions about the potion?

03:21.280 --> 03:23.120
Um, Miss Hardbroom?

03:23.960 --> 03:27.080
I prepped for a lesson
on duplicating a small animal.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.160
But you give us cheese.

03:31.480 --> 03:34.520
The second-years used up
the main ingredients

03:34.600 --> 03:36.440
for animal duplication.

03:36.960 --> 03:40.280
They'll have everything replenished
by the end of the day.

03:40.840 --> 03:44.320
Whereupon you'll be able to do
double the work,

03:45.040 --> 03:46.720
Clarice Twigg.

03:47.280 --> 03:48.280
Great!

03:51.640 --> 03:54.960
Miss Hardbroom did specify
you had to collect everything.

03:55.280 --> 03:57.720
But Hollow Wood is enchanted.

04:00.920 --> 04:03.040
Absolute nonsense, you silly witches.

04:03.560 --> 04:07.160
Enchanted? No. Enchanting? Yes!

04:07.440 --> 04:10.240
Look at all that dappled light.
It's wonderful!

04:11.640 --> 04:12.760
You must remember,

04:12.960 --> 04:16.120
there is nothing out there
stronger or more powerful

04:16.480 --> 04:18.880
than what is in here or what is in here.

04:20.279 --> 04:23.200
You see, being a witch
isn't just about the magic,

04:24.000 --> 04:25.360
it's about who you are.

04:26.360 --> 04:32.040
What's inside you. Your imagination,
compassion, selflessness.

04:33.320 --> 04:36.160
It's about being brave
and overcoming your fears,

04:36.240 --> 04:38.240
no matter how afraid you are.

04:38.320 --> 04:41.480
Okay, Miss Mould, we get the picture.
We're going.

04:42.640 --> 04:44.120
Okay. Well, chop-chop.

04:44.600 --> 04:47.440
Get to it and we'll all be home
in time for tea.

04:47.920 --> 04:50.560
Uh, aren't you supposed to be
coming with us?

04:50.640 --> 04:52.480
You are the designated adult.

04:52.840 --> 04:55.280
Hmm. I want to make use of this light.

04:56.040 --> 04:58.600
I'll follow along soon enough.
Off you go.

04:59.240 --> 05:01.040
Right. Woods it is.

05:29.040 --> 05:32.160
- Are we playing Witchball later?
- Wild horses couldn't stop me!

05:35.880 --> 05:37.480
- Esme!
- Sybie!

05:41.240 --> 05:43.280
Well met, Esmerelda.

05:44.080 --> 05:45.560
Well met, Miss Hardbroom.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.240
To what do we owe this pleasure?

05:49.120 --> 05:52.840
I came to see my sisters
and, hopefully, Miss Cackle.

05:54.160 --> 05:57.800
Ethel is off site at the moment
doing a task I've set.

05:59.160 --> 06:01.080
But I shall tell Miss Cackle you're here.

06:01.560 --> 06:02.560
Thank you.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.120
So, aren't you going to introduce me
to your friends?

06:10.320 --> 06:13.040
This is Beatrice, that's Clarice.
She's head of the year.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.960
I can't believe it. You're such a hero.

06:16.040 --> 06:19.280
Everyone knows what you did,
what you sacrificed to save Cackle's.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.760
- She's the best.
- Yes, but,

06:22.080 --> 06:26.080
since you no longer have any magic,
are you actually allowed to be here?

06:27.280 --> 06:28.120
Pardon?

06:28.200 --> 06:30.760
I thought non-magical girls
aren't allowed in academies.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.480
- Clarice.
- What?

06:32.760 --> 06:34.840
- I'm just say...
- You're not saying anything!

06:34.920 --> 06:36.880
She's the best sister, the best witch,

06:37.440 --> 06:40.440
the best head of year this academy
has ever had or will ever have!

06:40.680 --> 06:44.720
But... she's no longer magical.

06:45.480 --> 06:47.720
How dare she? How dare she?

06:47.800 --> 06:51.360
Look, I'm sure she didn't mean it.
She's just a bit blunt.

06:51.440 --> 06:55.240
- I don't care! She's not my friend.
- No, of course she is, Sybil.

06:56.360 --> 06:57.640
You should still be here.

06:58.720 --> 07:01.240
Well, maybe...
I'll be back sooner than you think.

07:01.640 --> 07:05.120
- What do you mean?
- Miss Cackle will see you. Now.

07:12.840 --> 07:14.600
What's wrong with all of you?

07:15.200 --> 07:17.640
- This place is...
- Don't say creepy.

07:18.080 --> 07:21.040
It's not creepy.
It's just trees and a bit of wind.

07:21.440 --> 07:25.880
Have none of you ever been camping?
I used to go every holiday with my mum.

07:26.040 --> 07:27.320
She was a Girl Guide.

07:27.400 --> 07:31.760
She taught me everything I know
about the countryside, trees, tracking...

07:35.800 --> 07:40.800
This, for example,
is called a badger's sett.

07:43.400 --> 07:45.840
Oh, look... I found some grimly grass.

07:47.480 --> 07:49.040
Definitely grimly grass.

07:49.520 --> 07:51.800
Yay. Another item ticked off the list.

07:52.600 --> 07:55.920
This place is about as enchanted
as a multi-storey car park.

07:56.440 --> 07:57.960
I can't take this anymore!

07:58.040 --> 08:00.920
Come on, Felicity,
we'll get the raven feathers.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.520
Really? Shouldn't we stick together?

08:03.600 --> 08:06.200
No! I want to get home before dark.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.480
Esmerelda!

08:27.080 --> 08:28.640
How nice to see you.

08:28.720 --> 08:32.120
Well met. What brings you here?

08:32.840 --> 08:35.640
Well met, Miss Cackle.
I was just visiting.

08:36.240 --> 08:37.640
You've been on my mind.

08:38.720 --> 08:40.320
How are you finding things?

08:44.880 --> 08:46.080
Esmerelda?

08:46.440 --> 08:47.440
I'm fine.

08:51.040 --> 08:52.680
Esme...

08:53.440 --> 08:55.520
No, really, I'm fine.
Everything's fine.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.240
Oh, dear.

08:59.240 --> 09:00.320
Tell me all about it.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.760
I just don't fit in,
in the non-magical world.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.320
I don't understand how anything works.

09:09.880 --> 09:13.800
You'll learn, Esmerelda.
These things take time.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.240
And it's all so boring, like...

09:17.680 --> 09:20.000
life with all the colours drained away.

09:24.080 --> 09:26.160
Come on, Sybil,
you know what Clarice is like.

09:26.240 --> 09:28.600
She was just being, you know, Clarice-y.

09:28.680 --> 09:31.200
- And she didn't understand what she said...
- Offensive.

09:31.280 --> 09:34.200
Yes, but,
can't we just be friends again, please?

09:34.280 --> 09:38.800
- No harm done?
- I'll think about it if she apologises.

09:38.880 --> 09:40.040
Sure. We can fix this.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.000
To me and my sister.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.960
Sure, easy fix.

09:47.760 --> 09:48.960
Very easy.

09:51.680 --> 09:53.960
- Raven feathers!
- Yup.

09:54.120 --> 09:55.680
Can we hurry up here?

09:55.760 --> 09:58.160
Are you going to go up
and get them, then?

09:58.320 --> 10:00.360
- Are you?
- I found them.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.560
I identified them.
No point in us both getting filthy.

10:05.640 --> 10:07.320
I'm the hurly and you're the burly.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.480
What does that even mean?

10:09.560 --> 10:11.160
We all have roles, Felicity.

10:11.880 --> 10:15.200
I'm a thinker, a problem solver,
a leader,

10:15.800 --> 10:17.560
and you're a doer.

10:18.240 --> 10:19.720
So, you get up the tree.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.120
Felicity?

10:28.200 --> 10:30.680
She wants me to say sorry to her
and her sister?

10:30.840 --> 10:31.840
She's upset.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.600
All I did was ask a simple question.

10:34.120 --> 10:36.560
But sometimes
that's not always a good thing.

10:36.840 --> 10:39.360
Sometimes we need to not say things.

10:40.320 --> 10:41.320
What do you mean?

10:42.480 --> 10:43.920
Please, just say sorry.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.200
- Of course I'll say sorry.
- Great.

10:47.360 --> 10:49.320
As soon as she apologises to me.

11:00.600 --> 11:01.600
Come on, Maud.

11:02.320 --> 11:05.360
- I think we've got enough already.
- Nearly there...

11:08.520 --> 11:09.680
Sorry.

11:10.720 --> 11:13.440
Let's get back to Miss Mould.

11:13.520 --> 11:14.520
It's getting late.

11:14.880 --> 11:17.600
I'm gonna stay.
I've nearly got this.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.160
I'll see you in a bit.

11:19.960 --> 11:22.080
Okay, yeah, see you in a bit.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.880
I don't think I'll ever fit in.

11:28.080 --> 11:29.080
How can we help?

11:29.920 --> 11:32.720
Might there be a role for me here
at Cackle's?

11:33.080 --> 11:37.320
With all my skills and everything
I've done, I could make a contribution.

11:37.640 --> 11:39.600
You want a... job?

11:42.880 --> 11:46.200
If it were down to me, the answer
would be "yes" in a heartbeat,

11:46.360 --> 11:47.360
but...

11:48.400 --> 11:52.440
there are rules
and a magical tradition we adhere to.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.480
I understand.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.880
Why don't you catch up with Sybil,
and I'll discuss it with Miss Hardbroom?

12:03.120 --> 12:05.240
Oh, thank you so much!

12:13.400 --> 12:15.520
You know she can't work here.

12:16.800 --> 12:19.000
There might be a precedent,
something.

12:19.920 --> 12:23.240
Ada, I'm not talking
about statutes and rules.

12:23.600 --> 12:26.080
I mean it would be torture for Esmerelda.

12:31.680 --> 12:35.400
That girl gave up her magic for me,
and all I've done is let her down.

12:37.280 --> 12:40.840
The only person to blame
for this is Agatha.

12:45.360 --> 12:46.360
Miss Mould!

12:47.960 --> 12:49.000
Miss Mould!

12:50.760 --> 12:51.960
Miss Mould?

13:24.360 --> 13:25.640
Hey, Esmerelda!

13:26.000 --> 13:29.080
If anyone can help me get Sybil
and Clarice back together, you can.

13:29.240 --> 13:31.800
Oh, Beatrice,
I'm not sure I'm able to help you.

13:32.480 --> 13:35.000
Clarice never meant to upset
or offend anyone.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.680
She just comes out with stuff.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.520
Sybil knows what she's like, but neither
will apologise until the other does.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.560
Okay, well, what do you need from me?

13:44.280 --> 13:47.360
We usually play Witchball,
but they haven't shown up.

13:47.440 --> 13:49.360
Maybe we can coax them out?

13:50.200 --> 13:51.880
I've got no powers anymore.

13:52.200 --> 13:55.040
Don't they play a game called netball
in the non-magical world?

13:55.280 --> 13:57.000
I don't really know much about it.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.200
See? You're a natural.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.120
Stay here. I'll go get them.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.400
Right.

14:17.840 --> 14:18.840
Miss Mould?

14:20.040 --> 14:22.960
Felicity! Where's Ethel?
Have you seen Miss Mould?

14:24.880 --> 14:25.720
Felice?

14:25.800 --> 14:29.720
Felicity? Hello, Felicity?

14:30.200 --> 14:32.960
Come on! Stop messing around!

14:42.960 --> 14:45.760
- It's true! This place is enchanted.
- What do you mean?

14:45.920 --> 14:48.400
Miss Mould's gone
and Felicity's in trance.

14:48.680 --> 14:49.680
Something's got her.

14:49.720 --> 14:52.400
- I'm sure there's an easy explanation.
- Follow me!

14:58.080 --> 14:59.080
It was this way.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.400
Mildred?

15:03.160 --> 15:04.640
It sounded like a monster.

15:05.080 --> 15:07.480
It's not a monster. It can't be.

15:08.120 --> 15:10.360
I mean, there's probably just a...

15:13.040 --> 15:14.040
Ethel?

15:14.440 --> 15:15.760
So, sort of a monster.

15:16.840 --> 15:19.640
Have you seen Felicity?
She's disappeared.

15:20.080 --> 15:22.160
Yeah, I've seen her. She turned into...

15:24.120 --> 15:25.120
something.

15:25.680 --> 15:30.040
I told you this wood was enchanted!
This is all your fault, Mildred Hubble.

15:30.760 --> 15:32.920
Agatha might listen to reason.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.560
Surely it's worth a try.

15:38.320 --> 15:40.320
Esmerelda gave up her magic for me.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.440
Agatha would never restore
Esmerelda's magic.

15:43.520 --> 15:45.040
It would end in disaster.

15:45.880 --> 15:49.920
This school and all the witches in it
is your life.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.400
I won't let you risk it.

15:52.920 --> 15:55.200
Not even for Esmerelda Hallow.

15:57.680 --> 15:59.000
You're right, Hecate.

16:01.560 --> 16:02.560
Yes!

16:06.320 --> 16:07.960
Sybil. Catch.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.520
Now try to get it through the hoop.

16:12.920 --> 16:13.920
What?

16:14.240 --> 16:16.040
Throw it with my hands?

16:16.400 --> 16:17.800
Yes, throw it, go on.

16:25.240 --> 16:27.160
Ooh, so close.

16:34.480 --> 16:37.200
- What do we do?
- Find Miss Mould.

16:37.880 --> 16:40.400
I'll use my outdoor skills
to track her down.

16:40.760 --> 16:44.240
If your outdoor skills
are anything like your indoor skills,

16:44.480 --> 16:46.400
we're in big trouble.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.080
Come on.

16:56.400 --> 17:00.120
Hopefully, having Sybil and Ethel here
will make it easier to break the news.

17:01.560 --> 17:05.160
Speaking of Ethel,
aren't the second-years a little overdue?

17:08.119 --> 17:10.720
- Where did you send them?
- Only to Hollow Wood.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.400
Hollow Wood?

17:14.240 --> 17:15.839
It's full of ingredients

17:15.920 --> 17:18.319
and there's been no trouble
for a hundred years.

17:19.760 --> 17:22.560
Well, if you're sure.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.280
Quite sure.

17:31.800 --> 17:36.080
Okay, footprints, broken branches.

17:36.160 --> 17:39.520
We're close, really close.

17:41.360 --> 17:42.360
Look!

17:44.880 --> 17:49.400
Oh, well done, Mildred Hubble.
You've discovered a paintbrush bush.

17:49.480 --> 17:51.840
- Top marks.
- It's Miss Mould's.

17:52.480 --> 17:53.920
And there she is!

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Miss Mould!

17:57.240 --> 17:58.920
Oh, are we glad to see you.

18:01.720 --> 18:04.120
Miss Mould? Are you alright?

18:06.560 --> 18:07.680
Miss Mould?

18:09.640 --> 18:10.680
Hello?

18:10.960 --> 18:12.040
What's done this?

18:13.920 --> 18:15.600
Maud, what do you think?

18:21.040 --> 18:23.400
- A hypnapillion.
- A what-nap-allion?

18:23.480 --> 18:24.920
It's supposed to be extinct.

18:25.280 --> 18:28.760
It feeds off people's minds,
fears, imagination.

18:29.440 --> 18:31.240
You mustn't look at one.

18:31.640 --> 18:35.280
It's sent Miss Mould
into "a semi-conscious dreamlike state".

18:35.600 --> 18:38.160
She's an art teacher.
How can you tell?

18:38.520 --> 18:40.640
"If the trance isn't broken
within two hours,

18:41.040 --> 18:44.080
the dreamlike state
becomes permanent".

18:44.680 --> 18:47.560
If there's anything in that book
about how to get out of this,

18:47.840 --> 18:49.360
it would be a good time to share.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.400
Ah, there's a potion to break the trance.

18:53.480 --> 18:56.040
We need grimly grass, yarrow and...

18:56.320 --> 18:59.600
oh, raven feathers,
the one thing we don't have.

19:00.880 --> 19:03.360
Come on, Ethel, lead the way.

19:08.520 --> 19:10.680
I'm sure they'll be fine
for a bit, Millie.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.440
Be careful, silly girl!

19:44.800 --> 19:45.800
Mr. Hallow?

19:46.920 --> 19:50.320
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for my daughter.

19:50.880 --> 19:54.520
Ethel? She's off collecting
ingredients somewhere.

19:54.880 --> 19:57.240
Showing her coven who's boss, I expect.

20:00.560 --> 20:01.560
Lovely girl.

20:01.960 --> 20:03.760
No, Esmerelda.

20:04.320 --> 20:05.320
Esmerelda?

20:05.560 --> 20:08.440
For reasons I cannot fathom,
she's come here.

20:09.040 --> 20:11.800
And my wife has sent me to fetch her.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.000
I haven't seen her.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.040
Oh, dear.

20:21.560 --> 20:24.880
This is good.
A bit weird, but good.

20:25.480 --> 20:27.760
The non-magic life might just be alright.

20:31.800 --> 20:33.000
Don't say that.

20:33.680 --> 20:36.600
I'd do anything for you to stay.
Anything.

20:38.120 --> 20:39.840
Would you lose all your friends?

20:40.320 --> 20:42.880
You know, sometimes a good friend
says what's needed,

20:42.960 --> 20:44.120
not always what's wanted.

20:44.880 --> 20:46.480
I think Clarice is a good friend.

20:48.800 --> 20:54.160
I'll always be your big sister, won't I?
It won't always be this tough, Sybie.

20:54.560 --> 20:58.000
But when it is, being with friends
makes it so much easier.

21:02.200 --> 21:03.400
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry!

21:05.040 --> 21:06.360
I don't have a sister.

21:06.800 --> 21:09.960
I should have tried to understand
that sororal dynamic better.

21:11.680 --> 21:15.800
Sororal, it means
that unique sister thing we have.

21:17.960 --> 21:22.280
I should've been more understanding.
I'm a lousy friend.

21:22.600 --> 21:23.600
No, you're not!

21:34.560 --> 21:36.000
Duplication?

21:40.640 --> 21:44.640
What in the wide world of wizardry?

21:47.640 --> 21:50.760
- I can't get up there!
- Levitation spell?

21:51.200 --> 21:53.480
There's too many branches.
It'll never work.

21:54.880 --> 21:55.880
I've got an idea.

21:56.560 --> 21:59.400
Oh, brilliant,
Mildred Hubble's got an idea.

22:02.600 --> 22:05.960
How about we get that creature
to knock the feathers out.

22:06.040 --> 22:07.040
What creature?

22:07.720 --> 22:08.720
Up there.

22:10.320 --> 22:11.960
It's kind of enchanting.

22:13.320 --> 22:14.760
Or we could just use this.

22:15.240 --> 22:17.520
And to think you doubted
my outdoor skills.

22:18.520 --> 22:19.520
Ethel?

22:22.200 --> 22:24.320
It's the hap-nop...
It's the hip-hap...

22:25.000 --> 22:28.120
The magic butterfly!
Don't look up, whatever you do.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.480
Come on, Maud, we need to get
this potion made and quick!

22:43.360 --> 22:45.600
Whoever thought netball was so crafty?

22:45.880 --> 22:47.480
Go Team Hallow!

22:47.560 --> 22:49.240
Esmerelda?

22:51.400 --> 22:53.880
I'm so sorry,
I really have tried everything,

22:55.080 --> 22:57.680
but I'm afraid you cannot work here.

22:58.920 --> 23:00.400
That's okay, Miss Cackle.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.040
I shouldn't have put you
on the spot like that.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.280
I love this place, but...

23:08.000 --> 23:10.200
I need to look forwards, Miss Cackle.

23:11.520 --> 23:12.960
I have a feeling I'll be okay.

23:14.440 --> 23:15.440
I know you will.

23:15.800 --> 23:18.240
- Esme? What is the meaning of this?
- Dad?

23:18.320 --> 23:19.480
- Dad!
- Mr. Hallow.

23:19.720 --> 23:21.640
- Well met.
- Well met, indeed.

23:21.880 --> 23:26.160
I shouldn't need to cast a finding spell
to locate my daughter.

23:26.240 --> 23:28.480
I assumed Esmerelda told you
where she was.

23:28.840 --> 23:31.680
I thought I'd make a quick trip
just to see Sybil and Ethel.

23:32.280 --> 23:33.440
And Miss Cackle.

23:33.520 --> 23:35.320
Why? Is she giving you your magic back?

23:35.400 --> 23:36.920
- Of course not.
- Of course not.

23:37.880 --> 23:40.120
What is going on here, Miss Cackle?

23:40.200 --> 23:43.840
You've been duplicating cheese
in the potion lab.

23:44.280 --> 23:47.160
Cheese, Miss Cackle. Cheese.

23:47.240 --> 23:49.840
Mr. Hallow, we were running
a little low on ingredients.

23:49.920 --> 23:51.560
The second-years,
with your daughter,

23:51.640 --> 23:54.120
are doing a fine job of replenishing them.

23:54.480 --> 23:55.880
Where have you sent them?

23:57.600 --> 23:58.600
Hollow Wood.

24:00.080 --> 24:01.080
Oh.

24:01.560 --> 24:05.240
I didn't think it could get any worse,
but it has.

24:05.480 --> 24:07.480
It really has!

24:18.480 --> 24:21.520
I'm not sure about this, Millie.
What if it doesn't work?

24:21.960 --> 24:22.960
It has to.

24:24.560 --> 24:25.560
Come on.

24:32.240 --> 24:34.440
<i>From deepest wood and darkest glade.</i>

24:34.760 --> 24:36.560
<i>Do not flee or be afraid.</i>

24:37.040 --> 24:41.600
<i>Take this thing that feeds on fear
Make the hypnapillion disappear.</i>

24:46.720 --> 24:47.880
What did we do wrong?

24:52.080 --> 24:55.240
- What are you doing? Don't look at it!
- It feeds off our fear.

24:56.040 --> 24:57.480
Well, I'm not afraid of it.

24:57.960 --> 24:59.400
Remember what Miss Mould said?

24:59.520 --> 25:01.920
A witch is about being brave
and overcoming your fear,

25:02.280 --> 25:04.200
no matter how afraid you are.

25:22.400 --> 25:23.520
You did it!

25:29.440 --> 25:32.840
I shall expect to hear from Ethel
as soon as she returns.

25:33.280 --> 25:36.920
I don't want another traumatised daughter,
courtesy of Cackle's.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.360
Come on, Esmerelda.

25:38.640 --> 25:40.200
Bye-bye, Sybil.

25:40.520 --> 25:44.560
My wife will be very interested to know
what's been going on around here.

25:45.040 --> 25:48.560
- There's nothing worth troubling her for.
- You think so? Ha!

25:49.040 --> 25:52.720
- Have you ever met Mrs. Hallow?
- Oh, I can assure you I have.

25:52.920 --> 25:55.240
Then you'll know
you've not heard the last of this.

25:55.560 --> 25:57.240
Not by a long chalk.

26:00.400 --> 26:03.040
They're just empty threats
by a hotheaded Hallow.

26:03.120 --> 26:05.280
- Hold tight.
- Esmerelda!

26:05.360 --> 26:06.880
Wait! Wait!

26:07.240 --> 26:10.320
No! No! Please wait! Come back!

26:11.480 --> 26:12.760
Esmerelda!

26:16.720 --> 26:18.240
It's gonna be alright, Ethel.

26:18.320 --> 26:20.520
Esme's gonna be okay
in the non-magical world.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.520
I needed to see her.
I could've helped her.

26:24.360 --> 26:26.080
This is your fault, Mildred Hubble!

26:26.280 --> 26:29.280
If we'd left when I said,
I wouldn't have missed Esmerelda!

26:29.360 --> 26:30.800
I'm sorry, Ethel.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.920
You have no idea what you've messed up.

26:36.600 --> 26:38.400
Millie! Maud!

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
I've been stock-taking all day.

26:42.480 --> 26:44.960
- It was awful.
- I wish I could have been there.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.120
Uh, you didn't have any trouble,
Miss Mould?

26:50.600 --> 26:52.400
We had a very productive trip.

26:52.920 --> 26:57.120
All ingredients collected
and some wonderful sketches.

26:58.680 --> 27:02.480
You've drawn a creature
that's been extinct for over a century.

27:04.040 --> 27:06.400
What a vivid imagination you must have.

27:08.200 --> 27:09.960
Good job you didn't bump into one.

27:10.560 --> 27:13.120
Nothing that a brave,
clever, and brilliant witch

27:13.200 --> 27:14.920
couldn't have gotten us out of.
