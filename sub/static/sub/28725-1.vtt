00:46.327 --> 00:47.861
Hey, everyone.

00:47.863 --> 00:50.063
First of all, I'd like to start
by saying I'm really sorry

00:50.065 --> 00:52.799
that I haven't posted
a video in a few weeks.

00:52.801 --> 00:57.604
But the reason is because
Matthew has proposed to me.

00:57.606 --> 00:59.873
Yes, so we are
officially engaged.

00:59.875 --> 01:01.674
I'm so excited, it's
still sinking in.

01:01.676 --> 01:03.977
And look how
beautiful my ring is.

01:03.979 --> 01:05.812
I've got loads and loads
of videos to show you guys

01:05.814 --> 01:07.948
over the last few weeks, our
engagement party and stuff,

01:07.950 --> 01:10.851
so I'll be posting those
up when I get a chance.

01:10.853 --> 01:13.754
Another reason why I've
been so busy is I am flying

01:13.756 --> 01:16.356
out to the San Francisco
meet and greet,

01:16.358 --> 01:17.858
so please, you've
all been writing in,

01:17.860 --> 01:19.693
please come along and meet me.

01:19.695 --> 01:20.861
I'm so excited to meet you.

01:20.863 --> 01:23.363
People I've met before,
people I haven't.

01:23.365 --> 01:24.865
So please do come along.

01:24.867 --> 01:28.736
All of the details are below
of where to come and meet me.

01:28.738 --> 01:30.971
I'm coming out to LA today
with my friends Jessica

01:30.973 --> 01:32.840
and Lisa, and we're gonna
be doing the Route 101

01:32.842 --> 01:34.809
all the way to San Francisco.

01:34.811 --> 01:36.944
I'm gonna be uploading
all the videos,

01:36.946 --> 01:38.113
so stay tuned for those.

01:38.115 --> 01:41.149
You guys love Lisa and Jessica
from the Thailand video,

01:41.151 --> 01:43.919
so I'm sure it's gonna be just
as crazy as the last time.

01:45.421 --> 01:49.757
And my Uber is five minutes
away, so I'm gonna go.

01:49.759 --> 01:50.892
But please stay tuned
for more videos.

01:50.894 --> 01:52.459
Like I said, I'm gonna be
uploading them all the time.

01:52.461 --> 01:53.962
Like, subscribe, and follow me.

01:53.964 --> 01:55.666
See you in LA, guys, bye.

02:00.537 --> 02:02.571
I just wanted to show
you how gorgeous this is.

02:02.573 --> 02:04.906
So we're traveling over
Westminster Bridge at the moment,

02:04.908 --> 02:07.943
and if you look just ahead,
you can see the iconic Big Ben

02:07.945 --> 02:09.012
just in front of us.

02:13.984 --> 02:17.086
Okay, so I think it's
the next left, just here.

02:17.088 --> 02:18.520
Yep, this one.

02:18.522 --> 02:20.957
And they should be
anywhere around here.

02:20.959 --> 02:21.924
There they are.

02:21.926 --> 02:22.757
Actually, just here, yeah.

02:22.759 --> 02:23.592
Can you just pull here?

02:23.594 --> 02:25.094
Thank you.

02:25.096 --> 02:27.562
Hey, ladies.

02:27.564 --> 02:28.197
Hello.

02:28.199 --> 02:29.033
Want a ride, chick?

02:32.904 --> 02:35.638
Oh my gosh, guys, I
can't believe that Jess

02:35.640 --> 02:38.708
is wearing sunglasses on a
typical gloomy day in London.

02:38.710 --> 02:41.110
- Typical.
- Thank you so much.

02:41.112 --> 02:42.945
Oh.

02:42.947 --> 02:44.082
- Hello.
- Hello.

02:45.516 --> 02:47.183
Jesus, you took your time.

02:47.185 --> 02:48.718
We've been freezing
our tits off out here.

02:48.720 --> 02:50.987
Yeah, Soph, what
took you so long?

02:50.989 --> 02:53.156
Sorry, I forgot to
charge the camera, didn't I?

02:53.158 --> 02:54.624
And then, when the driver came,

02:54.626 --> 02:56.561
I just had to check
that I had everything.

02:58.863 --> 03:00.063
Are you okay, Lisa?

03:00.065 --> 03:01.530
- Yeah.
- She's been sick all morning.

03:01.532 --> 03:02.465
Oh no.

03:02.467 --> 03:03.733
Yeah, I think it was sushi

03:03.735 --> 03:05.468
that I had yesterday
at the airport.

03:05.470 --> 03:07.104
Made my belly a bit funny.

03:07.106 --> 03:09.106
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, no, I'm fine.

03:09.108 --> 03:13.076
Okay, so, tell me
then how was the job in Ibiza?

03:13.078 --> 03:14.978
Yeah, it was amazing.

03:14.980 --> 03:16.146
Not gonna lie to you,

03:16.148 --> 03:17.881
I literally just got paid to
party for the whole month.

03:17.883 --> 03:19.516
The guys weren't too
bad either, so...

03:19.518 --> 03:21.718
I can't believe it's been
a month since we saw you.

03:21.720 --> 03:22.953
I know.

03:22.955 --> 03:25.189
So, how many guys did
you hook up with then?

03:25.191 --> 03:26.123
10?

03:26.125 --> 03:27.925
A lady does not kiss and tell.

03:27.927 --> 03:29.093
Whatever.

03:29.095 --> 03:30.661
I've already lost
count, you dirty bitch.

03:30.663 --> 03:33.131
Oh no, it wasn't
even like that.

03:33.133 --> 03:34.665
Anyway, enough about me.

03:34.667 --> 03:36.000
Let's see this ring then.

03:36.002 --> 03:37.869
Here it is.

03:37.871 --> 03:38.702
Oh wow.

03:38.704 --> 03:40.071
Babe, it's stunning.

03:40.073 --> 03:40.939
- Thank you.
- Lucky you.

03:40.941 --> 03:42.506
He did a
good job, didn't he?

03:42.508 --> 03:43.942
Mm.

03:43.944 --> 03:46.610
So, okay, say
hello to the camera, girls.

03:46.612 --> 03:48.447
- Hi there.
- Hey there.

03:49.149 --> 03:50.615
How is all the
vlogging going, babe?

03:50.617 --> 03:51.916
Not too bad, thanks.

03:51.918 --> 03:52.917
You know she's got

03:52.919 --> 03:54.252
over two million
subscribers now?

03:54.254 --> 03:56.287
- Are you joking?
- No.

03:56.289 --> 03:58.289
Babe, that's
amazing, I'm proud of you.

03:58.291 --> 03:59.223
Well, thank you.

03:59.225 --> 04:02.227
Yeah, getting there
now, slowly but surely.

04:02.229 --> 04:04.562
So, are you planning on
vlogging the whole trip then or?

04:04.564 --> 04:06.131
Yeah, definitely.

04:06.133 --> 04:08.167
I'm not gonna risk
missing anything epic

04:08.169 --> 04:09.634
like we did last time.

04:09.636 --> 04:12.737
So, girls, wherever we
go, the camera goes.

04:12.739 --> 04:13.738
That is cool with me, babe.

04:13.740 --> 04:15.207
Best behavior then, ladies.

04:15.209 --> 04:16.274
- You.
- You.

04:16.277 --> 04:18.243
- You.
- No, both of you.

04:18.245 --> 04:21.180
- Look at these.
- Mm, nice.

04:21.182 --> 04:23.282
But I think I need a
bikini body though.

04:23.284 --> 04:24.484
Aw, so cute.

04:26.220 --> 04:27.052
Look at you two.

04:27.054 --> 04:27.888
Oh, Jess.

04:31.258 --> 04:33.225
I just need to
go to the bathroom.

04:33.227 --> 04:34.026
I'm gonna find
you guys in a bit.

04:34.028 --> 04:36.028
Oh no,
are you okay, babe?

04:36.030 --> 04:37.763
Yeah, I'll find
you guys in a bit.

04:37.765 --> 04:38.998
Okay.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.032
We'll go grab a
coffee then, yeah?

04:40.034 --> 04:41.334
Jess.

04:41.336 --> 04:42.335
- Jess.
- Huh, what'd you say?

04:42.337 --> 04:43.269
Let's go get coffee.

04:43.271 --> 04:44.603
Oh, you're always on your phone.

04:44.605 --> 04:45.539
Come on, let's go.

04:59.287 --> 05:00.720
Jess.

05:00.722 --> 05:02.523
Jess, do you need
to get any suncream?

05:04.359 --> 05:05.193
Nope.

05:09.031 --> 05:12.234
You are complete and utter
filth, you do know that.

05:13.935 --> 05:15.336
I knew she was gonna do that.

05:15.338 --> 05:16.337
I knew you were gonna do that.

05:16.339 --> 05:18.104
You are so predictable.

05:18.106 --> 05:20.274
Kiss my ass, baby.

05:20.276 --> 05:21.275
You're probably
gonna get arrested

05:21.277 --> 05:22.909
for stalking in a
minute, you do know that.

05:22.911 --> 05:24.178
Oh, don't
be stupid, will you?

05:24.180 --> 05:26.180
I'm not breaking any laws.

05:26.182 --> 05:28.182
He is quite hot though, Soph.

05:28.184 --> 05:29.950
Suppose there's
no harm in looking.

05:29.952 --> 05:32.286
Too bad you're
taken eh, Sophie?

05:32.288 --> 05:35.056
Hey, like I said, no
harm in looking, okay?

05:35.058 --> 05:36.857
Okay, okay.

05:36.859 --> 05:39.128
Just sowing my seed, that's all.

05:42.365 --> 05:43.397
How is Matt, anyway?

05:43.399 --> 05:45.800
Yeah, yeah,
he's really good, thanks.

05:45.802 --> 05:47.369
He's with his parents this
weekend helping them move

05:47.371 --> 05:49.103
into their new home.

05:49.105 --> 05:52.407
And apart from that,
he's busy working.

05:52.409 --> 05:54.278
Saving for the wedding.

05:55.711 --> 05:57.912
Seriously though, you're
a lucky girl, Sophie.

05:57.914 --> 05:58.746
Matt's amazing.

05:58.748 --> 06:00.415
All right, easy, Jess.

06:00.417 --> 06:01.651
What, he is.

06:03.187 --> 06:04.252
We're just jealous of you, babe.

06:04.254 --> 06:06.121
Yeah, we're just really
jealous of you, babe.

06:06.123 --> 06:08.857
Aw, well thanks
for the compliments, girls.

06:08.859 --> 06:10.194
And I know.

06:11.361 --> 06:12.461
Your wedding's
gonna be amazing.

06:12.463 --> 06:15.330
Firstly, I've always wanted
to be a sexy bridesmaid.

06:15.332 --> 06:18.366
And secondly, I'm pretty sure

06:18.368 --> 06:21.872
that Matt's friend Sam wants
me, so that's my night sorted.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.273
You literally have
no chill do you, girl?

06:25.275 --> 06:26.708
You're only being like that

06:26.710 --> 06:27.410
'cause he's not
interested in you.

06:27.412 --> 06:28.777
Wow.

06:28.779 --> 06:30.779
You can be such
a dick sometimes.

06:30.781 --> 06:33.684
Seriously, you
two need to pack it in.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.053
Baby, text me like that.

06:37.055 --> 06:39.021
Oh yeah, text me harder.

06:39.023 --> 06:40.789
I like it, I like it.

06:40.791 --> 06:42.724
Oh fuck yeah, baby,
text me harder.

06:42.726 --> 06:44.026
Oh, it's coming.

06:44.028 --> 06:45.196
And it's sent.

06:46.364 --> 06:48.331
You are not
right in the head.

06:48.333 --> 06:50.733
Have you just
figured that one out?

06:50.735 --> 06:51.901
I don't want to be
with a guy who's more

06:51.903 --> 06:54.704
into his phone than he is in me.

06:54.706 --> 06:56.706
I see it all the time now.

06:56.708 --> 06:57.940
You know what,

06:57.942 --> 06:59.809
maybe they're just both
researching something.

06:59.811 --> 07:01.312
I don't think so.

07:02.448 --> 07:04.381
Social media ruins
relationships.

07:04.383 --> 07:07.049
I mean, she's probably
innocently updating her status

07:07.051 --> 07:09.919
and he's probably
inboxing some random girl.

07:09.921 --> 07:11.255
Cheating bastard.

07:11.257 --> 07:13.791
This is
our massive plan.

07:15.327 --> 07:17.163
Jess, get out my shot.

07:18.297 --> 07:19.862
Thanks.

07:19.864 --> 07:20.798
Keep going.

07:21.733 --> 07:22.833
Shoulder window.

07:22.835 --> 07:24.101
Dammit.

07:24.103 --> 07:25.402
Jess gets
her own way again.

07:25.404 --> 07:28.205
- You're slow.
- Yes, thank you.

07:28.207 --> 07:31.375
- Let me help you with that.
- Aw, thank you so much.

07:31.377 --> 07:32.743
What a gentleman.

07:32.745 --> 07:33.511
See?

07:33.513 --> 07:34.811
How's far again?

07:34.813 --> 07:36.380
Ugh, something
like 12 hours.

07:36.382 --> 07:37.915
12 hours?

07:37.917 --> 07:40.083
Good job I was up
all night then,

07:40.085 --> 07:42.453
so I can sleep all the way.

07:42.455 --> 07:45.057
Who was you up
with last night then, missy?

07:48.060 --> 07:50.430
Come on then,
Jess, who were you with?

07:51.298 --> 07:52.132
Ryan.

07:53.799 --> 07:58.071
He came to the bar to see me
at work and work was quiet,

07:59.206 --> 08:00.473
so finished early and
went back to my...

08:01.875 --> 08:03.274
Ryan, after
what he's done to you?

08:03.276 --> 08:04.878
How did that even happen?

08:05.979 --> 08:07.478
Oh, I don't know.

08:07.480 --> 08:10.549
He texted me some silly meme
thing about relationships,

08:10.551 --> 08:12.283
so I messaged him.

08:12.285 --> 08:14.219
Ugh, you're not gonna
get back with him, are you?

08:14.221 --> 08:16.788
No, of course not, just
miss him, that's all.

08:16.790 --> 08:18.823
The guy is such a dick.

08:18.825 --> 08:20.392
Yeah, I
agree with Lisa, Jess.

08:20.394 --> 08:21.826
I mean, he did cheat on you.

08:21.828 --> 08:23.861
I mean, you don't even
know how many times.

08:23.863 --> 08:25.063
Ugh, the guy is such a loser,

08:25.065 --> 08:27.466
anyway, you can do so
much better than him.

08:27.468 --> 08:29.368
I'm not getting back with him.

08:29.370 --> 08:30.536
It's just a bit of sex.

08:30.538 --> 08:33.871
I mean, a heroin addict don't
just come off it, do they?

08:33.874 --> 08:35.874
They have to ween
themselves off it first,

08:35.876 --> 08:37.409
so that's what I'm doing.

08:37.410 --> 08:39.211
As long as you know
what you're doing, babe.

08:39.212 --> 08:41.413
Don't forget how much
he hurt you last time.

08:41.414 --> 08:42.948
We just don't wanna see
you go through that again.

08:42.950 --> 08:44.183
I actually hate that guy.

08:44.184 --> 08:45.851
I know, I know.

08:45.853 --> 08:48.020
Thanks, ladies, but I
know what I'm doing, okay?

08:48.022 --> 08:50.022
Okay, if you say so.

08:50.024 --> 08:52.026
Okay, girls, here we go.

08:55.029 --> 08:55.863
LA, baby.

08:57.299 --> 08:59.301
- Cali, baby.
- Cali, baby.

09:02.504 --> 09:04.371
Oh, she doesn't like flying.

09:04.373 --> 09:07.142
- Aw, poor baby.
- Baby, doesn't like flying.

09:08.876 --> 09:11.177
Aw, don't bother.

09:11.179 --> 09:13.515
You'll be fine, just
watch one of the films.

09:15.050 --> 09:18.051
- It's okay.
- We're off the ground now.

09:18.053 --> 09:19.888
- I'm sorry, babes.
- Aw.

09:20.989 --> 09:21.921
I forgot you
didn't like flying.

09:21.923 --> 09:22.924
Oh, and we're going up, ah.

09:24.293 --> 09:26.562
When's the trolley
coming with the gin?

09:27.530 --> 09:28.995
- Here we go.
- Going up.

09:28.997 --> 09:29.630
We're going
up, we're going up.

09:29.632 --> 09:31.097
- Bye-bye, London.
- Bye.

09:31.099 --> 09:34.100
Boy, bye, peace.

09:50.987 --> 09:53.054
Look at the size of that place.

09:53.056 --> 09:54.021
Bloody huge, innit?

09:54.023 --> 09:56.259
Is that what
you say to all the boys?

09:59.195 --> 10:01.896
Such a
comedian, aren't you?

10:01.898 --> 10:05.166
The buildings are like a
cancerous growth down there.

10:05.168 --> 10:06.100
Did you start a
big cult philosophy

10:06.102 --> 10:07.404
or something, you weirdo?

10:09.238 --> 10:12.173
Well, ladies,
somewhere down there

10:12.175 --> 10:15.277
is my next get-over-Ryan
hookup for the night.

10:15.279 --> 10:17.078
- Yes.
- Really?

10:17.080 --> 10:18.482
Good girl.

10:20.983 --> 10:21.618
Woo, woo.

10:23.587 --> 10:25.589
Bouncy, bouncy.

10:26.623 --> 10:28.590
Here we are at LAX.

10:28.592 --> 10:31.193
- LA, baby.
- LA, baby.

10:31.195 --> 10:32.627
- LA.
- LA, LA.

10:32.629 --> 10:34.229
Woo.

10:34.231 --> 10:36.198
We are in America.

10:36.200 --> 10:39.569
We have just left LAX Airport
and security is really tight

10:39.571 --> 10:41.403
so I couldn't film
inside, but that was fine.

10:41.405 --> 10:43.138
We had to wait ages
for Jess's bag.

10:43.140 --> 10:45.240
We thought it was
lost, but thank God,

10:45.242 --> 10:46.509
we found it in the end.

10:46.511 --> 10:47.543
It literally only
happened to her.

10:47.545 --> 10:50.313
Literally only
happened to her.

10:50.315 --> 10:52.013
- Ouch.
- God.

10:52.015 --> 10:53.516
Oh, blue skies and sunny shine.

10:53.518 --> 10:55.418
Traffic, look, that's insane.

10:55.420 --> 10:57.487
No way, it's nothing
compared to Bangkok though.

10:57.489 --> 10:59.255
Oh god, that trip was nuts.

10:59.257 --> 11:01.691
You remember when Jess
almost died down there?

11:01.693 --> 11:03.426
Oh god, yeah, Jess,
that was really close.

11:03.428 --> 11:05.161
You were actually really lucky.

11:05.163 --> 11:06.396
That actually wasn't
my fault because that guy

11:06.398 --> 11:08.664
came outta nowhere
on that tuk-tuk.

11:13.238 --> 11:16.172
To be fair, we were about
10 liters deep by that point.

11:16.174 --> 11:17.974
Could you imagine that
on your headstone though?

11:17.976 --> 11:20.511
Here lies Jessica Louise
Taylor, a beautiful human being

11:20.513 --> 11:24.581
who was loved by all, but she
was struck down in her prime

11:24.583 --> 11:26.115
by a stray tuk-tuk.

11:27.253 --> 11:28.352
That's not funny.

11:28.354 --> 11:29.286
Ow.

11:29.288 --> 11:30.421
Watch where you're going.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.689
An apology would have been nice.

11:32.691 --> 11:34.224
What an idiot,
are you all right?

11:34.226 --> 11:36.093
Dickhead.

11:36.095 --> 11:37.094
That's probably the most
action you're gonna get

11:37.096 --> 11:38.228
on this whole trip, Lis.

11:39.098 --> 11:39.797
Not in the mood
for your shit today.

11:39.799 --> 11:43.300
Play nice, please, children.

11:43.302 --> 11:45.235
Bay 67, girlies.

11:45.237 --> 11:46.270
- 67?
- Yeah.

11:46.272 --> 11:47.072
Keep going.

11:48.274 --> 11:51.074
If it's any
of these ones here...

11:51.076 --> 11:53.647
- Oh my god, it's that one.
- Are you kidding me?

11:54.781 --> 11:57.415
- Are we actually?
- Oh my god.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.451
I don't
have a bus license.

11:59.453 --> 12:00.718
Are you sure
you don't wanna go

12:00.720 --> 12:02.754
for something maybe a
little bit bigger, Lisa?

12:02.756 --> 12:06.593
I have seen smaller
tanks than this, literally.

12:07.694 --> 12:08.662
Look at the size of it.

12:12.199 --> 12:13.798
It's massive.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.167
I'm actually gonna need
a step-ladder to get on.

12:17.270 --> 12:18.738
This is for a family of 10.

12:21.575 --> 12:24.108
- Oh, Lisa.
- Oh my god.

12:24.110 --> 12:25.711
- Lisa.
- So funny.

12:25.713 --> 12:29.550
- Are you happy, darling?
- What are you doing?

12:30.450 --> 12:31.684
Lisa.

12:31.686 --> 12:33.117
I'm gonna
upload this Friday.

12:33.119 --> 12:35.220
Guys, I can't even
touch the pedals.

12:35.222 --> 12:36.287
Why have
they given us this?

12:36.289 --> 12:38.390
I can't even see
over the bonnet.

12:38.392 --> 12:40.392
It's got three rows.

12:40.394 --> 12:42.261
Hashtag small girl problems.

12:42.263 --> 12:45.533
I actually feel like
a midget in this.

12:47.101 --> 12:49.335
I can't do it, I refuse
to drive this shit.

12:49.337 --> 12:51.170
I'm sorry.

12:51.172 --> 12:53.608
I'm actually crying,
I can't, I can't deal.

12:55.343 --> 12:56.843
What's the matter, you
hoping for something bigger?

12:56.845 --> 12:58.244
Are you joking?

12:58.246 --> 12:59.278
We need to do something
about this wagon.

12:59.280 --> 13:00.246
I can't...

13:00.248 --> 13:01.213
Actually, we're hoping

13:01.215 --> 13:01.715
she'll grow into it, you know?

13:01.717 --> 13:02.381
Miracle-Gro.

13:04.118 --> 13:05.117
Legging suction.

13:05.119 --> 13:07.386
Hey, we're in LA,
surgery is a possibility.

13:07.388 --> 13:08.855
Oh, shut up.

13:08.857 --> 13:11.491
Well, you know if you
head back to the office

13:11.493 --> 13:12.459
and ask to swap,
they'd be up for it.

13:12.461 --> 13:14.159
- That would be good.
- That would be perfect.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.462
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that'd be great.

13:15.464 --> 13:16.830
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

13:16.832 --> 13:18.832
Now that's more like it.

13:18.834 --> 13:22.702
So, this is our car, guys,
after that little fiasco.

13:22.704 --> 13:24.337
I think it's perfect,
although it's a bit big

13:24.339 --> 13:25.739
compared to what we
normally drive in London,

13:25.741 --> 13:27.741
but we'll get used
to it, it's fine.

13:27.743 --> 13:29.409
Thanks, babe.

13:29.411 --> 13:31.177
Now, are you sure
you're gonna be all right

13:31.179 --> 13:32.279
in this one, Lisa?

13:32.281 --> 13:33.547
You don't want me to run back

13:33.549 --> 13:35.348
and see if they've got
a smart car or anything?

13:35.350 --> 13:36.483
Smart-ass.

13:36.485 --> 13:37.551
Maybe we'll get a two-seater

13:37.553 --> 13:39.486
and we'll lock you in the booth.

13:39.488 --> 13:41.321
- Thank you, Lisa.
- That's not very nice.

13:41.323 --> 13:42.723
You'll miss me when I'm gone.

13:42.725 --> 13:45.495
- I don't think so.
- Aw, we will.

13:49.231 --> 13:50.431
Lis, can you please
put on the air con, babe?

13:50.433 --> 13:51.599
It's bloody roasty in here.

13:51.601 --> 13:54.236
It is on, babe, I know it
is a bit beef jerky in here.

13:55.505 --> 13:57.238
Right, got the address, it's...

13:57.240 --> 13:58.506
No no, can you just wait?

13:58.508 --> 13:59.473
Can you wait?

13:59.475 --> 14:00.541
It's not getting the roam in.

14:00.543 --> 14:01.742
Well, shaking it

14:01.744 --> 14:03.477
like a salt shaker's
not gonna help.

14:03.479 --> 14:05.381
But it might, I need to get
the American signal, don't I?

14:06.749 --> 14:08.182
- Lisa?
- Mm?

14:08.184 --> 14:10.151
Can you put the
Bluetooth on, please?

14:10.153 --> 14:11.385
But you
better not put any

14:11.387 --> 14:12.353
of that heavy metal
crap on, I swear.

14:12.355 --> 14:13.656
All right, I promise.

14:16.860 --> 14:19.193
I'm sure it'll
connect in time.

14:19.195 --> 14:19.830
Bluetooth on.

14:22.298 --> 14:23.364
- Got it?
- Yep.

14:23.366 --> 14:25.536
Oh, for God's sake.

14:26.737 --> 14:29.236
One song and I mean it, I've
got a headache as it is.

14:29.238 --> 14:31.473
Okay, baby doll.

14:31.475 --> 14:32.874
- I trust you.
- Right, okay.

14:32.876 --> 14:36.311
- Jess, put your seatbelt on.
- Of course, Momsy.

14:36.313 --> 14:40.582
- Girl, safety first.
- That's how I like it.

14:44.622 --> 14:48.223
- Oh my god, what is that?
- Would you shut up?

14:48.225 --> 14:50.425
Soph, what is
Google Maps saying?

14:50.427 --> 14:52.327
It's saying
to take the next left.

14:52.329 --> 14:53.730
What, left here, yeah?

14:53.732 --> 14:55.397
Not this one!

14:55.399 --> 14:57.232
Oh my god, would
you please just

14:57.234 --> 14:59.535
turn that shit music off for
one minute and the camera?

14:59.537 --> 15:00.870
I need to concentrate, please.

15:00.872 --> 15:02.337
She's abusive.

15:02.339 --> 15:03.539
Yeah, she's
not used to driving

15:03.541 --> 15:04.574
on this side of the
road, obviously.

15:04.576 --> 15:07.810
Here we are, girls, Rodeo Drive.

15:07.812 --> 15:09.345
Oo naked.

15:09.347 --> 15:10.613
Oh my god,
look at all these shops.

15:10.615 --> 15:12.915
I love that the palms
just line the streets.

15:12.917 --> 15:14.684
Yeah, how
beautiful is this?

15:14.686 --> 15:15.720
So pretty.

15:16.588 --> 15:18.688
I love Celine, Celine bags.

15:18.690 --> 15:20.590
Okay, you need to
get yourselves a sugar daddy

15:20.592 --> 15:22.592
on the trip then,
that's what I think.

15:22.594 --> 15:24.727
Probably have
about 10 in my phone.

15:24.729 --> 15:28.799
Of course you
do, of course you do.

15:28.801 --> 15:31.367
♪ Bright and wave, Rodeo Drive

15:31.369 --> 15:32.736

15:32.738 --> 15:34.004
Oh, I love Chanel.

pretty room and shop?

15:35.574 --> 15:37.306

coming up on the left.

work on commission?

15:40.946 --> 15:42.446
Yeah, sure, we do.

15:42.448 --> 15:43.279
Big mistake.

15:43.281 --> 15:44.014
Huge.

15:44.016 --> 15:45.549
Mistake.

15:45.551 --> 15:46.650
Isn't it this one?

15:46.652 --> 15:48.752
Isn't it this one
on the corner here?

15:48.754 --> 15:50.721
Well, that was intense.

15:50.723 --> 15:52.656
Tell me, though, how
did you stay so calm?

15:52.658 --> 15:54.460
Namaste, bitches.

15:55.628 --> 15:56.794
Leave that one,
babe, I'll get it in a minute.

15:56.796 --> 15:57.996
- Sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

15:57.998 --> 15:59.363
You know, it's a
good you were driving

15:59.365 --> 16:00.531
or we would've
never have got here.

16:00.533 --> 16:01.465
- Watch your head.
- Excuse me.

16:01.467 --> 16:03.369
Speak for yourself, Sophie.

16:05.939 --> 16:06.873
- This it?
- Yeah.

16:12.378 --> 16:13.011
You sure
this is the right one?

16:13.013 --> 16:14.344
Can you see anything?

16:16.750 --> 16:17.649
Hi, can I help you?

16:17.651 --> 16:19.283
Yeah, we have a
reservation for tonight

16:19.285 --> 16:20.985

16:20.987 --> 16:22.687

Sophie.

16:42.676 --> 16:43.743
There's one in the fridge, so.

16:43.745 --> 16:44.877
- Yeah.
- Sophie.

16:44.879 --> 16:46.011
Great, thank you so much.

16:46.013 --> 16:50.448
Thank you for everything,

16:57.592 --> 16:58.958
Look.

16:58.960 --> 17:00.559
Guys, guys, you
looked at the view?

17:00.561 --> 17:01.527
Soph.

17:01.529 --> 17:03.829
Oh my gosh, look at this view.

17:03.831 --> 17:04.696
That is insane, babe.

17:04.699 --> 17:07.500
I think that's
downtown LA down there.

17:07.502 --> 17:11.904
So, here we are in our LA
pad, in the Hollywood Hills.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.839
Can you actually believe it
that we're actually here?

17:13.840 --> 17:14.673
- I can't believe it.
- Amazing.

17:14.675 --> 17:15.508
This is way better.

17:15.510 --> 17:16.776
We've got a pool.

17:16.778 --> 17:20.512
- We have a pool, ladies.
- As warm as he is, man.

17:20.515 --> 17:22.782
Oh my gosh, we can
literally sit up here

17:22.785 --> 17:24.917
and have breakfast.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.521
Oh my goodness me, look.

Do you know what?

17:28.924 --> 17:30.090
This is better than it
was in the pictures.

17:30.092 --> 17:32.425
- Like way better.
- Love it.

17:32.427 --> 17:34.728
I never expected
it to be like this.

17:34.730 --> 17:36.830
Should we go inside
and have a look inside?

17:36.832 --> 17:37.833
Have a look.

17:38.934 --> 17:40.967
Look at the
sultriness in here.

17:52.816 --> 17:55.850
- Someone get me my grapes.
- I will feed you your grapes.

17:55.852 --> 17:59.086
The Egyptian-African
vibe going on in here.

17:59.088 --> 18:00.755
So sultry.

18:00.757 --> 18:02.489
Pardon me, ladies,
would you like some tea?

18:02.491 --> 18:03.691
Yes, darling, feed me.

18:03.693 --> 18:05.827
That'd be nice
after a long flight.

18:05.829 --> 18:06.994
A piano.

18:06.996 --> 18:07.962
I can play the
piano for us later.

18:07.964 --> 18:09.063
No, we're good, thanks.

18:09.065 --> 18:10.867
My mom and dad...

18:12.035 --> 18:13.534
My mom and dad would
love this so much.

18:13.536 --> 18:15.937
- It's so nice.
- So nice, I love it.

18:15.939 --> 18:17.405
Soph, shall
we go see the bedrooms?

18:17.407 --> 18:19.040
Yes, there's
only two bedrooms,

18:19.042 --> 18:20.608
so one of you is gonna
have to share with me.

18:20.610 --> 18:22.944
- I'll share with you.
- Yeah, cool, let's go.

18:24.982 --> 18:27.015
It really
smells in here.

18:27.017 --> 18:28.150
What is that smell?

18:28.152 --> 18:30.751
Oh, babe,
give me the camera.

18:30.753 --> 18:32.087
It smells like that time
I had that house party

18:32.089 --> 18:34.690
and that guy vomited all
over my parents' carpet.

18:34.692 --> 18:36.091
Do you remember?

18:36.093 --> 18:37.192
Stunk for weeks.

18:37.194 --> 18:38.994
Well, don't just
stand there, open a window.

18:38.996 --> 18:41.364
That guy must
love to party, man.

18:42.066 --> 18:43.866
It's making me feel sick.

18:43.868 --> 18:45.033
All right, let's go
see Lisa's room next.

18:45.035 --> 18:46.001
Anything's gotta be
better than this.

18:46.003 --> 18:47.436
Thanks, Jess.

18:47.438 --> 18:49.771
Well, babe,
you know what I mean.

18:49.773 --> 18:51.073
I am very grateful.

18:51.075 --> 18:51.909
Ah.

18:53.143 --> 18:54.543
Well, this is an improvement

18:54.545 --> 18:57.446
from the old vom
factory back there.

18:58.849 --> 19:00.649
Soph, do you wanna
switch with me, babe?

19:00.651 --> 19:01.583
I feel bad.

19:01.585 --> 19:02.484
No, no, it's fine.

19:02.486 --> 19:03.852
It's just for one night.

19:03.854 --> 19:05.621
It's somewhere to
crash, it's fine.

19:05.623 --> 19:06.990
I'll swap with you.

19:06.992 --> 19:08.992
Oh, let me think about it.

19:08.994 --> 19:10.795
Yeah, I've thought about it, no.

19:12.563 --> 19:14.230
Okay, girls, I'm
gonna go and message Matthew

19:14.232 --> 19:15.932
and let him know
we've got here safe.

19:15.934 --> 19:17.901
Get changed and then we'll
head to the Hollywood sign.

19:17.903 --> 19:20.503
- Solid plan.
- Yes, sir.

19:20.505 --> 19:22.505
Oo, this bed's comfy.

19:22.507 --> 19:23.873
- Yay.
- Jess, Jess, look.

19:23.875 --> 19:25.074
- What?
- Jess, the Hollywood sign.

19:25.076 --> 19:26.175
Quick.

19:26.177 --> 19:27.612
- There.
- Hell yeah.

19:32.251 --> 19:34.619
Oh wow, we are so close.

19:36.721 --> 19:39.189
Guys, I have
something to show you.

19:39.191 --> 19:40.157
I'm coming, Jesus.

19:40.159 --> 19:41.358
Look at this.

19:41.360 --> 19:43.027
Look how close we've managed
to get to the Hollywood sign.

19:43.029 --> 19:44.761
I didn't even know we
could get this close,

19:44.763 --> 19:45.963
I'm so excited to be here.

19:45.965 --> 19:47.932
I've gotta also show
you this view over here.

19:47.934 --> 19:50.734
You can literally see the
whole of LA from here.

19:50.736 --> 19:51.835
It's...

19:51.837 --> 19:52.770
Lisa, are you all right?

19:52.772 --> 19:54.472
I can't find my phone.

19:55.641 --> 19:56.674
Did you leave
it at the apartment?

19:56.676 --> 19:57.975
I swear I had it in here.

19:57.977 --> 19:59.176
I don't know what
I've done with it.

19:59.178 --> 20:00.077
Well, babe,
we were rushing.

20:00.079 --> 20:01.679
I'm sure you've left
it at the apartment

20:01.681 --> 20:03.047
and probably on the
bed or something.

20:03.049 --> 20:04.982
- Don't worry.
- Yeah.

20:04.984 --> 20:07.117
Yeah,
definitely not in there?

20:07.119 --> 20:07.985
What's happened?

20:07.987 --> 20:08.986
Ah, Lis
can't find her phone.

20:08.988 --> 20:10.888
Well, have you checked
your bag properly, babe?

20:10.890 --> 20:12.257
Oh, what does it look like?

20:12.259 --> 20:13.191
Do you know what?

20:13.193 --> 20:14.192
Maybe it was in your pocket

20:14.194 --> 20:14.993
and it's dropped
down in the car.

20:14.995 --> 20:16.227
Let's have a look, yeah?

20:16.229 --> 20:17.162
Jess, you go and do a
selfie or something.

20:17.164 --> 20:19.596
We'll be back in a minute.

20:21.234 --> 20:22.599
This is so annoying.

20:22.601 --> 20:24.637
I'm sure I had it in my bag.

20:26.139 --> 20:28.974
Well, it's
not this side at all.

20:28.976 --> 20:29.941
Is it underneath your chair,

20:29.943 --> 20:32.045
dropped down behind, underneath?

20:33.180 --> 20:34.247
Nothing, sure?

20:35.115 --> 20:36.181
Do you know what?

20:36.183 --> 20:37.849
Like I said, babe, I'm
sure it's at the apartment.

20:37.851 --> 20:39.050
We'll just look for
it when we get back.

20:39.052 --> 20:41.653
- Promise, yeah?
- All right.

20:41.655 --> 20:42.489
Come on.

20:44.325 --> 20:48.026
Don't let it ruin your day,
babe, because look at this.

20:48.028 --> 20:50.929
Ah, she's a beauty.

20:50.931 --> 20:52.899
How big does
she look close up?

20:54.901 --> 20:55.702
Massive.

20:57.637 --> 20:59.171
How are your selfies going?

20:59.173 --> 21:00.775
Fabulous, as always.

21:02.110 --> 21:03.342
Did you find the phone?

21:03.344 --> 21:04.744
No, I think I left it
back at the apartment.

21:04.746 --> 21:05.978
Well, I hope so anyways.

21:05.980 --> 21:07.079
Ah, I'm sure you have, babe.

21:07.081 --> 21:10.282
Don't stress about it for
now, 'cause we are here.

21:10.284 --> 21:12.184
- Yay.
- Woo-hoo.

21:12.186 --> 21:14.353
So good.

21:14.355 --> 21:15.955
You checked us in
already, you kino?

21:15.957 --> 21:18.691
Of course, what
else would I be doing?

21:18.693 --> 21:19.625
Oh, sod it.

21:19.627 --> 21:20.993
Let's have a selfie then.

21:20.995 --> 21:22.563
- Pucker up, you sexy bitch.
- If you insist.

21:24.333 --> 21:27.033
Okay, girls, let's
have a video as well.

21:27.035 --> 21:28.301
- Ready?
- Yes.

21:28.303 --> 21:29.269
After three, Hollywood, baby.

21:29.271 --> 21:30.337
One, two, three.

21:30.339 --> 21:33.606
Hollywood, baby, woo!

21:33.608 --> 21:35.242
It doesn't get old,
right, I still love it.

21:36.912 --> 21:37.878
One sec, hang on.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.212
Excuse me, hello.

21:39.214 --> 21:40.313
Yeah, hey.

21:40.315 --> 21:41.848
Would you please take a
photo of me and my friends?

21:41.850 --> 21:43.183
Yeah, yeah,
shouldn't be a problem.

21:43.185 --> 21:45.085
Excuse me,
would you just hold this

21:45.087 --> 21:45.952
and film for me, please?

21:45.954 --> 21:47.387
Is that okay?

21:47.389 --> 21:48.757
Thank you so much, here.

21:50.626 --> 21:52.726
Assume the position, ladies.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.261
The position, ladies.

21:54.263 --> 21:55.228
Assume it, assume it.

21:55.230 --> 21:56.696
Look a little skinny.

21:56.698 --> 21:58.200
All right, smile, ladies.

21:59.369 --> 22:00.634
Hold on.

22:00.636 --> 22:02.138
Just a couple more
for good luck.

22:03.206 --> 22:04.138
There we are.

22:04.140 --> 22:06.407
Stop it, you are such a freak.

22:06.409 --> 22:08.142
Here you go.

22:08.144 --> 22:09.643
- Thank you.
- Yeah, sure.

22:09.645 --> 22:10.811
I really appreciate it.

22:10.813 --> 22:11.913
Would you mind
taking a photo of us?

22:11.915 --> 22:13.815
- I mean...
- Of course not, mister.

22:13.817 --> 22:16.685
- Yeah.
- My friend and I, do this.

22:18.254 --> 22:19.189
Okay.

22:20.290 --> 22:21.689
- Ready?
- Yeah.

22:21.691 --> 22:24.659
Tense those muscles, boys.

22:24.661 --> 22:25.693
Very nice.

22:25.695 --> 22:26.329
Oh, that's hot.

22:28.432 --> 22:29.931
Which one?

22:29.933 --> 22:31.232
Me.

22:31.234 --> 22:33.736
- I guess, already.
- So basic.

22:35.206 --> 22:39.740
Well, okay, I mean, so,
judging by your accents,

22:39.742 --> 22:41.042
you're not from around here.

22:41.044 --> 22:42.444
Right, is that a
good assumption?

22:42.446 --> 22:44.679
Are you guys Australian or?

22:44.681 --> 22:46.747
Do you
like it down under?

22:46.749 --> 22:48.851
- Oh no.
- I'm not opposed to it.

22:48.853 --> 22:50.718
I wouldn't say no if
given the opportunity.

22:50.720 --> 22:53.188
Okay, too much too
soon there, buddy.

22:53.190 --> 22:54.323
Oh my, oh my.

22:54.325 --> 22:55.824
No, we're from London.

22:55.826 --> 22:56.859
What about you guys?

22:56.861 --> 22:58.093
- San Fran.
- Oh really?

22:58.095 --> 22:59.261
- Yeah.
- That's where we're going.

22:59.263 --> 23:00.262
- No way.
- Really?

23:00.264 --> 23:01.096
- Yes way.
- When?

23:01.098 --> 23:02.764
Tomorrow.

23:02.766 --> 23:03.799
Yeah, we're just doing
some sight-seeing here today

23:03.801 --> 23:06.201
and, you know, the
obligatory stuff that you do

23:06.203 --> 23:07.405
when you come to LA.

23:08.839 --> 23:11.106
You're seriously
spending one day in LA?

23:11.108 --> 23:12.841
Oh no, no no no.

23:12.843 --> 23:13.942
- We're coming back next week.
- There's a lot to do.

23:13.944 --> 23:14.977
Yeah, I know, I know.

23:14.979 --> 23:16.112
We're coming back next week.

23:16.114 --> 23:17.380
There's just something
that I really

23:17.382 --> 23:18.981
have to go to in San
Fran, that's all.

23:18.983 --> 23:21.084
- Yeah.
- All right, well.

23:21.086 --> 23:22.285
Well, we're gonna go down

23:22.287 --> 23:24.120
to the Hollywood Walk
of Fame next if...

23:24.122 --> 23:25.054
- Oh yeah.
- It's fun.

23:25.056 --> 23:27.123
I mean, it's worth it.

23:27.125 --> 23:29.292
- Probably not today.
- What, why?

23:29.294 --> 23:31.361
No, you know,
we're jet-lagged.

23:31.363 --> 23:33.129
We gotta get up in the
morning for San Fran.

23:33.131 --> 23:35.498
Soph, I think it'll
be so good, babe.

23:35.500 --> 23:38.203
I think it sounds like
a really good idea.

23:39.337 --> 23:40.203
- No?
- No.

23:40.205 --> 23:41.505
Yes?

23:41.507 --> 23:43.039
- Sophie.
- Yes.

23:43.041 --> 23:44.475
- Yes.
- Sophie?

23:44.477 --> 23:46.276
Okay, okay, fine.

23:46.278 --> 23:47.977
No, I'm totally outnumbered.

23:47.979 --> 23:49.480
I lose there.

23:49.482 --> 23:51.282
Right, so first of all,
guys, what are your names?

23:51.284 --> 23:54.185
- Well, I'm Cody.
- And I'm Brandon.

23:54.187 --> 23:55.785
- Hi, I'm Jess.
- Hi, Jess.

23:55.787 --> 23:56.587
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Hi, Jess.

23:56.589 --> 23:58.755
- We kiss in London.
- All right.

23:58.757 --> 24:00.157
- I'm your queen.
- Okay.

24:00.159 --> 24:01.225
- Hey, I'm not opposed.
- Hi.

24:01.227 --> 24:03.793
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Lisa.

24:03.795 --> 24:05.229
Hi, Lisa.

24:06.365 --> 24:07.398
We shake hands in England.

24:07.400 --> 24:08.834
- Hello.
- In England.

24:09.835 --> 24:11.235
I thought we were in LA.

24:11.237 --> 24:14.205
- Yeah, yeah, you're right.
- Yeah, yeah, I am.

24:14.207 --> 24:15.039
I'm Sophie.

24:15.041 --> 24:17.408
Hi, Sophie.

24:17.410 --> 24:19.009
Hi, Sophie.

24:19.011 --> 24:21.413
Well, hey, it's nice
to meet you ladies.

24:21.415 --> 24:24.382
So, why don't you follow
us and let's get moving?

24:24.384 --> 24:25.417
- Okay.
- Yeah?

24:25.419 --> 24:26.585
- Yeah?
- Let's do it.

24:26.587 --> 24:28.220
- It sounds like so much fun.
- It's gonna be a fun time.

24:28.222 --> 24:29.922
- It's gonna be a fun time.
- Yeah.

24:36.296 --> 24:37.929
I'll try not
to drive too fast,

24:37.931 --> 24:39.097
so, you ladies try to keep up.

24:39.099 --> 24:40.532
Drive slow, please,

24:40.534 --> 24:41.466
because I get really
confused on the wrong side.

24:41.468 --> 24:42.467
He goes fast.

24:42.469 --> 24:45.804
- They are so hot.
- I know, tell me about it.

24:45.806 --> 24:46.805
If I wasn't
getting married,

24:46.807 --> 24:48.873
girls, I definitely would.

24:48.875 --> 24:49.841
Sophie.

24:49.843 --> 24:51.409
Don't worry,
I'll cut that bit out.

24:51.411 --> 24:52.946
Matthew, I love you, my baby.

24:54.414 --> 24:57.450
Yeah, I definitely would
not kick them out of bed.

24:57.452 --> 24:58.883
Well, it's a
good job you're sleeping

24:58.885 --> 25:00.986
with me tonight then,
because I actually don't

25:00.988 --> 25:02.921
wanna be listening to
that little scenario.

25:02.923 --> 25:04.423
Oh, unless you
wanna switch with me.

25:04.425 --> 25:06.858
Mm, I'll think about it
and see how the night goes.

25:06.860 --> 25:08.960
Just have to work my charms.

25:08.962 --> 25:10.396
Oh, you're not
being serious, are you?

25:10.398 --> 25:11.830
About what?

25:11.832 --> 25:12.831
About sleeping
with the both of them.

25:12.833 --> 25:15.001
Um, don't act all
innocent with me, Ms. Lisa.

25:15.003 --> 25:16.168
Like you've never
done it before.

25:16.170 --> 25:17.403
I knew you was
gonna bring that up.

25:17.405 --> 25:18.938
You know that was
with my ex-boyfriend.

25:18.940 --> 25:19.605
That was a long time ago.

25:19.607 --> 25:20.539
I'm not proud of it.

25:20.541 --> 25:22.008
And you know what I'm
like when I'm drunk.

25:22.010 --> 25:23.009
Excuses, excuses.

25:23.011 --> 25:25.945
Yeah, well I'm on
holiday, so I don't care.

25:25.947 --> 25:27.380
You two
are unbelievable.

25:27.382 --> 25:29.048
Aw, thanks, babe.

25:29.050 --> 25:30.584
Love ya.

25:30.586 --> 25:31.585
Watch what you're doing
unless you want us to die.

25:31.587 --> 25:35.522
Oh, don't be so
overdramatic, will you?

25:35.524 --> 25:37.256
Oh shit, I actually
think I've lost them.

25:37.258 --> 25:38.958
What's the sat map
saying, how far?

25:38.960 --> 25:40.795
Not far, about a mile?

25:46.435 --> 25:48.968
You ladies
sure took your time.

25:48.970 --> 25:50.504
If you two hadn't been
such dicks and drove off

25:50.506 --> 25:52.005
and left us on our own, you
wouldn't be still waiting

25:52.007 --> 25:54.074
like two spare pricks
at an orgy, would you?

25:54.076 --> 25:55.042
No, I guess not.

25:55.044 --> 25:57.044
- We apologize right, Brandon?
- Yeah, we do.

25:57.046 --> 25:58.278
Good.

25:58.280 --> 25:59.880
You'll have some making
up to do then, mister.

25:59.882 --> 26:00.514
I'll look forward to that.

26:00.516 --> 26:02.051
Come on, you guys.

26:03.085 --> 26:03.919
Hi.

26:06.255 --> 26:08.188
So, I've been
meaning to ask you,

26:08.190 --> 26:10.123
what's with all the filming?

26:10.125 --> 26:12.427
Sophie is a YouTuber.

26:12.429 --> 26:13.927
- Yep.
- Oh, all right.

26:13.929 --> 26:15.929
I film everything.

26:15.931 --> 26:16.997
I've got a friend
that does that.

26:16.999 --> 26:18.999
Actually makes some pretty
good money at it too.

26:19.001 --> 26:19.933
- Yeah.
- Oh really?

26:19.935 --> 26:20.768
I don't think about the money.

26:20.770 --> 26:23.036
I do it because
I really love it.

26:23.038 --> 26:25.139
Yeah, but you gotta make pretty
good money at it or else...

26:25.141 --> 26:26.240
- Oi.
- What?

26:26.242 --> 26:27.608
Or else you
wouldn't be here in LA right?

26:27.610 --> 26:29.010
Yeah, you
can do, I guess.

26:29.012 --> 26:31.112
She's got over two
million subscribers.

26:31.114 --> 26:32.380
- Two million?
- All right.

26:32.382 --> 26:34.351
Jess, stop
telling people that.

26:36.353 --> 26:38.453
So, you're famous.

26:38.455 --> 26:41.122
- No, not really.
- Yes, she is.

26:41.124 --> 26:42.390
That's why we're
going to San Fran,

26:42.392 --> 26:45.193
because there's a big
event where all the fans

26:45.195 --> 26:47.061
can meet their
favorite vloggers.

26:47.063 --> 26:48.064
- Ah.
- Jess.

26:49.199 --> 26:50.666
As you can see, she gets
a little bit shy about it.

26:50.668 --> 26:52.135
Such a whiner.

26:53.304 --> 26:54.137
Enough said.

26:56.106 --> 26:57.506
Can I get your autograph?

26:57.508 --> 26:58.440
Don't you start.

26:58.442 --> 26:59.641
Can you sign something for me?

26:59.643 --> 27:00.975
You guys are
gonna have to join

27:00.977 --> 27:03.112
that big long queue back there.

27:03.114 --> 27:05.383
All right, I'm in.

27:08.619 --> 27:10.185
He's a half-albino.

27:10.187 --> 27:12.154
He's not a full albino.

27:12.156 --> 27:14.623
But you know, most boas are
like gray or black or something,

27:14.625 --> 27:17.426
yeah, and most albinos are
like yellow and white, right?

27:17.428 --> 27:19.328
The little one
keeps looking at me.

27:19.330 --> 27:20.663
She's
not gonna bite you,

27:20.665 --> 27:22.064
she's not gonna bite.

27:22.066 --> 27:23.232
They don't have any
fangs, no venom.

27:23.234 --> 27:25.635
Okay, oh, he's
really looking at me.

27:25.637 --> 27:28.005
He's really looking at me.

27:29.374 --> 27:30.607
One more time.

27:30.609 --> 27:32.675
Okay, here we go,
where's the camera?

27:32.677 --> 27:34.279
We're gonna go...

27:35.280 --> 27:38.248
Guys, so we are on the
Hollywood Walk of Fame.

27:38.250 --> 27:40.116
You can literally see
the stars as I walk.

27:40.118 --> 27:41.284
It's insane here.

27:41.286 --> 27:43.219
It's really,
really, really busy.

27:43.221 --> 27:44.154
Everyone's having a great time.

27:44.156 --> 27:46.389
We've got Batman back there.

27:46.391 --> 27:48.124
We've got Spider-Man.

27:48.126 --> 27:50.160
Oh, some Marvel
character here as well.

27:50.162 --> 27:52.028
Transformers as well.

27:52.030 --> 27:55.231
Everyone but anyone is
here on the Walk of Fame.

27:55.233 --> 27:57.267
Guys, you having fun?

27:57.269 --> 27:58.236
- Sure.
- Yeah.

28:00.540 --> 28:03.039
Try this though,
babe, it is grim.

28:03.041 --> 28:04.140
- What is it?
- I don't know.

28:04.142 --> 28:04.941
- It's absinthe.
- Oh god, no.

28:04.943 --> 28:07.010
Just try it,
it's good for you.

28:07.012 --> 28:08.245
No, thank you.

28:08.247 --> 28:10.383
Yeah, have some.

28:12.218 --> 28:13.451
Oi, oi, girls.

28:13.453 --> 28:15.619
Not a bad price for
a cheeky little spin.

28:15.621 --> 28:17.021
We'll drink.

28:17.023 --> 28:18.722
No, Lis,
you just had a drink.

28:18.724 --> 28:19.790
Oh, don't be soft,
just give me some gin,

28:19.792 --> 28:20.624
I mean they're never gonna know.

28:20.626 --> 28:22.426
Oh come on, Sophie.

28:22.428 --> 28:25.331
You only live once, babe,
don't be such a spoil sport.

28:26.332 --> 28:28.767
See, Sophie doesn't have
a bad bone in her body.

28:28.769 --> 28:30.367
She always does the right thing.

28:30.369 --> 28:33.805
Oh, is that so, Jess?

28:33.807 --> 28:35.239
Well, what about you guys?

28:35.241 --> 28:36.675
Eh, you girls go ahead.

28:36.677 --> 28:38.108
We've done this already.

28:38.110 --> 28:39.511
- You sure?
- Yeah.

28:39.513 --> 28:41.212
- No worries.
- Yeah, we're positive.

28:41.214 --> 28:42.380
We're gonna get
something to eat here,

28:42.382 --> 28:45.082
hang out, top these off, and
we'll figure out something

28:45.084 --> 28:46.150
when you guys get back.

28:46.152 --> 28:49.321
Well, you heard the
man, girls, let's do this.

28:49.323 --> 28:51.389
Guys, look at this car.

28:51.391 --> 28:53.625
Aw thanks, babe, go
on, you go first.

28:53.627 --> 28:55.794
Yeah, we need to pay as well.

28:55.796 --> 28:58.396
Aw, look at this car, guys,
can you actually believe

28:58.398 --> 28:59.798
we're in Hollywood
riding this car?

28:59.800 --> 29:01.299
Hey, we need to pay.

29:01.301 --> 29:03.502
Hope you've got insurance.

29:03.504 --> 29:06.471
- Okay, now where?
- It's really low.

29:06.473 --> 29:08.106
- This way?
- Where we going?

29:08.108 --> 29:09.276
Straight, girls, woo.

29:10.344 --> 29:14.379
Just having a little
cruise in my car, you know?

29:14.381 --> 29:15.380
See,
Hollywood style, ladies.

29:15.382 --> 29:16.482
That's how we do.

29:16.484 --> 29:18.484
- That's how we do.
- That's how we do.

29:18.486 --> 29:20.419
I feel like
a rapper, you know?

29:20.421 --> 29:22.220
- She feels like a rapper.
- I feel like a rapper.

29:22.222 --> 29:24.122
♪ Versace, Versace,
Medusa head on me ♪

29:24.124 --> 29:29.130
♪ And no one can stop me,
Ferrari, Ferrari, Ferrari ♪

29:30.365 --> 29:31.230
Oh my fuck.

29:31.232 --> 29:34.200
You actually drove
like a boss, babe.

29:34.202 --> 29:35.434
Well, how was it?

29:35.436 --> 29:36.836
That was
fogging amazing.

29:36.838 --> 29:38.437
Did you take any selfies or?

29:38.439 --> 29:39.539
Of course I did.

29:39.541 --> 29:41.507
Literally something to
cross off the bucket list.

29:41.509 --> 29:42.441
It was so good.

29:42.443 --> 29:43.609
Literally, it was one

29:43.611 --> 29:45.311
of the coolest things
I've ever done.

29:45.313 --> 29:46.178
You know, I don't think
anything's gonna top that.

29:46.180 --> 29:47.380
- Oh.
- Oh, so good.

29:47.382 --> 29:49.248
So, guys, what's the plan now?

29:49.250 --> 29:51.384
You guys been to
Venice or Santa Monica?

29:51.386 --> 29:52.251
Yes.

29:52.253 --> 29:53.620
I mean, well, no,
but let's do that.

29:53.622 --> 29:54.655
Okay,
yeah, it sounds fun.

29:54.657 --> 29:55.822
How far, how far is it?

29:55.824 --> 29:57.256
It's about 15 miles from here,

29:57.258 --> 29:58.625
but we've been
drinking a little bit

29:58.627 --> 30:00.360
so let's just take an Uber

30:00.362 --> 30:01.461
if that's all right
with you guys.

30:01.463 --> 30:03.363
I shouldn't but,
guys, I don't mind driving.

30:03.365 --> 30:05.198
Oo, well it's
gonna be a squeeze.

30:05.200 --> 30:07.134
I have to lie on your lap.

30:07.136 --> 30:07.768
I don't mind.

30:10.606 --> 30:12.274
- Let's do it.
- Come on then.

30:13.475 --> 30:17.812
Okay, guys, so here
we are on Venice Beach.

30:17.814 --> 30:19.680
We are literally in hippy town.

30:19.682 --> 30:21.415
I mean, just look over here.

30:21.417 --> 30:23.685
There's like a place where
you can actually buy weed.

30:23.687 --> 30:25.285
Apparently, it's legal here.

30:25.287 --> 30:28.155
People are literally
smoking weed on the street.

30:28.157 --> 30:30.257
The only thing that I could
really think this is like

30:30.259 --> 30:34.796
is Camden in London, but
way cooler and by the sea.

30:34.798 --> 30:37.601
Anyway, I think
they've gone ahead.

30:46.910 --> 30:49.880
- Come on, babe, let's go.
- Come on.

30:51.949 --> 30:53.448
Wow.

30:53.450 --> 30:55.452
Soph, tell Matthew bye-bye.

30:57.587 --> 31:00.421
- Sh.
- Yeah, go in there.

31:00.423 --> 31:04.127
Sure, thank
you so much, thank you.

31:05.529 --> 31:08.530
- Thank you.
- Got some popcorn?

31:08.532 --> 31:11.367
Okay though, we may
have to cut this bit out.

31:11.369 --> 31:12.468
Matthew cannot see this.

31:12.470 --> 31:15.204
Never seen anything
like that for my life.

31:15.206 --> 31:16.372
- Oh, we see how it is.
- Hi.

31:16.374 --> 31:17.406
- Hey.
- 'Sup, y'all.

31:17.408 --> 31:18.941
Come on,
Cody, this is ridiculous.

31:18.943 --> 31:19.608
- Are you here all the time?
- Are you real?

31:19.610 --> 31:20.544
Can I touch you?

31:21.612 --> 31:23.879
He's real, he's actually real.

31:23.881 --> 31:25.280
Wow.

31:25.282 --> 31:26.582
I'm not at the table
eating, you know?

31:26.584 --> 31:28.651
- Oh wow.
- I'm out here working out.

31:28.653 --> 31:30.887
You just eat that
protein, yeah, all day long?

31:30.889 --> 31:32.554
A lot of that, yeah.

31:32.556 --> 31:34.523
A lot of fish, a lot of chicken.

31:34.525 --> 31:35.825
- Damn.
- A lot of hot buns.

31:35.827 --> 31:37.661
- He's got bigger boo...
- Yes, oh my god.

31:37.663 --> 31:39.798
He's actually got
bigger boobs than Jess.

31:41.967 --> 31:47.171
I eat the brunettes
with the zet too, so.

31:47.873 --> 31:49.539
You know what, guys,

31:49.541 --> 31:50.740
can I just say, are you filming?

31:50.742 --> 31:52.442
Please, just keep filming.

31:52.444 --> 31:53.710
We're not
gonna miss this.

31:53.712 --> 31:54.744
Matthew can do
far better than that.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.646
Yeah,
sure he can, babe.

31:56.648 --> 31:58.515
Buy yourself something nice.

31:58.517 --> 31:59.582
You've earned it.

31:59.584 --> 32:04.256
Excuse me, take
the dollar, baby.

32:04.924 --> 32:06.824
I got some drinks for us.

32:06.826 --> 32:08.558
- Oh yeah.
- Drinks.

32:08.560 --> 32:09.426
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Cody.

32:09.428 --> 32:10.429
Thank you.

32:11.663 --> 32:14.497
- Cheers, guys.
- Oh my gosh, that's so good.

32:14.499 --> 32:16.701
Thanks,
this is great, awesome.

32:16.703 --> 32:19.837
- Me and you have to trade.
- Yeah, we have to trade.

32:19.839 --> 32:21.972
- Yeah, fuck you guys.
- Put some in here for us.

32:21.974 --> 32:23.374
Yeah, yeah.

32:23.376 --> 32:26.010
Now you guys
will wanna share.

32:26.012 --> 32:27.845
Yeah, now I'm
gonna fuck you guys up.

32:27.847 --> 32:30.781
With absinthe,
that's gonna be grim.

32:30.783 --> 32:31.816
- Jess.
- Oh my god.

32:31.818 --> 32:32.950
- You're gonna ruin it.
- Jess.

32:32.952 --> 32:35.621
- The green one's really good.
- Here, here, have some.

32:36.689 --> 32:39.857
No no no no
no, thank you, no, no.

32:39.859 --> 32:42.293
Corn dog, corn dog, corn
dog, we're trying one.

32:42.295 --> 32:43.028
Wait, wait.

32:43.030 --> 32:44.495
Over here, over here, over here.

32:44.497 --> 32:45.696
This
place looks good.

32:45.698 --> 32:47.833
Can I see a menu?

32:47.835 --> 32:50.334
Yeah, it looks awesome.

32:50.336 --> 32:52.671
Oh, are you Sophie?

32:52.673 --> 32:53.638
Babe.

32:53.640 --> 32:54.673
It's really nice to meet you.

32:54.675 --> 32:56.641
Give me the
camera, give me the camera.

32:56.643 --> 32:58.309
Hi, it's really,
really nice to meet you.

32:58.311 --> 32:59.444
- All the time.
- Oh, you do?

32:59.446 --> 33:01.480
- You are so beautiful.
- So are you.

33:01.482 --> 33:02.814
Wait, what?

33:02.816 --> 33:03.749
It's so nice to meet you too.

33:03.751 --> 33:04.683
Sophie's really famous?

33:04.685 --> 33:05.484
Can I take a selfie with you?

33:05.486 --> 33:07.454
Oh, of course you can.

33:08.756 --> 33:10.722
- So nice to meet you.
- Yeah, nice to meet you too.

33:10.724 --> 33:12.891
- You're beautiful in person.
- Aw, thank you.

33:12.893 --> 33:14.895
You're so beautiful too.

33:15.729 --> 33:16.996
- Thank you.
- So good to meet you.

33:16.998 --> 33:18.430
Guys, did you wanna
get some food here?

33:18.432 --> 33:19.831
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

33:19.833 --> 33:21.335
Go, Cody.

33:23.104 --> 33:25.637
Come on, baby, show
us what you got.

33:25.639 --> 33:30.645
Go, Brandon.

33:31.378 --> 33:32.344
Oh yeah.

33:32.346 --> 33:35.047
What's going on over here then?

33:35.049 --> 33:36.816
So, you got enough in
your mouth there, babe?

33:36.818 --> 33:38.918
It's girthy.

33:38.920 --> 33:39.752
You all right, Soph?

33:39.754 --> 33:41.120
Yeah, yeah.

33:41.122 --> 33:42.588
What's wrong?

33:42.590 --> 33:44.390
I just got a text
from a random number.

33:44.392 --> 33:45.658
- Really?
- What number?

33:45.660 --> 33:49.862
It's just literally a
bunch of random numbers.

33:49.864 --> 33:50.698
What are they?

33:51.633 --> 33:54.034
One, one, two, three,
one, two, one, five,

33:54.036 --> 33:56.904
one, four, two, seven,
one, five, three, six,

33:56.906 --> 33:58.638
one, seven, two, five.

33:58.640 --> 33:59.940
Just literally random numbers.

33:59.942 --> 34:00.908
It's probably
just a wrong number, babe.

34:00.910 --> 34:02.310
Yeah, it must be, hon.

34:03.611 --> 34:04.814
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:05.881 --> 34:07.815
- Oh come on.
- What are you doing?

34:07.817 --> 34:09.683
- Whoa.
- Cody.

34:09.685 --> 34:10.951
Brandon, stop.

34:10.953 --> 34:12.652
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:12.655 --> 34:14.588
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
- We do, we do, we do, we do.

34:14.590 --> 34:15.856
Whoa, dude, come on.

34:15.858 --> 34:17.925
Let's go, let's go,
let's get the heck outta here.

34:17.927 --> 34:18.761
Let's go.

34:23.098 --> 34:25.399
Pamela Anderson's got
nothing on me, baby.

34:25.400 --> 34:26.632
No, she doesn't.

34:26.635 --> 34:29.837
She is literally
such a showoff.

34:29.839 --> 34:31.438
Oh, do you know what, fuck it.

34:31.440 --> 34:33.507
- When in Rome, homeboys.
- Yeah, let's do it.

34:33.509 --> 34:37.610
- Screw it, let's do it.
- Let's do it, let's do it.

34:37.612 --> 34:42.619
You are mad, mad.

34:46.922 --> 34:47.989
Leave the camera.

34:47.991 --> 34:49.623
Come in, babe.

34:49.626 --> 34:50.958
No, no.

34:50.960 --> 34:53.194
You guys both have your fun.

34:53.196 --> 34:54.929
As usual.

34:54.931 --> 34:55.764
It's fine.

34:56.833 --> 34:58.435
Screw you all then.

35:00.637 --> 35:01.936
- It's freezing.
- Oh my god.

35:01.938 --> 35:03.504
Actually, it's
quite nice in there

35:03.506 --> 35:05.840
when you got a handsome
man to keep you warm.

35:05.842 --> 35:08.043
Oh, is someone
feeling jealous?

35:10.848 --> 35:12.081
Stop, no.

35:12.083 --> 35:13.082
I don't know about you lot,

35:13.084 --> 35:14.649
but I could definitely
do with another drink.

35:14.651 --> 35:15.885
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah, yeah.

35:15.887 --> 35:17.119
- Same here.
- Screw it, Santa Monica Pier.

35:17.121 --> 35:18.954
- Yes.
- Yeah.

35:18.956 --> 35:20.756
Oh, I dunno,
it's getting late.

35:20.758 --> 35:23.058
Oh come on, Soph,
just live a little.

35:23.060 --> 35:25.628
- Have a couple of drinks.
- Okay, fine.

35:25.630 --> 35:26.929
I could do with a stiff one.

35:26.931 --> 35:28.964
Is Matt coming then?

35:28.966 --> 35:31.066
You're really
funny, Jess, hilarious.

35:31.068 --> 35:32.201
Shame I can't drink though.

35:32.203 --> 35:33.235
What, why?

35:33.237 --> 35:34.770
Because I'm driving.

35:34.772 --> 35:35.840
Who's Matt?

35:36.807 --> 35:37.973
Matt?

35:37.975 --> 35:39.477
Matt's her fiance.

35:40.678 --> 35:42.012
You're
getting married?

35:42.014 --> 35:43.712
- Yeah, did she not tell you?
- No way.

35:43.714 --> 35:44.880
Congratulations.

35:44.882 --> 35:46.815
- I say we celebrate.
- Let's do it.

35:46.817 --> 35:48.051
Let's celebrate.

35:48.053 --> 35:49.886
Celibacy on this
trip, more like.

35:49.888 --> 35:51.254
Shut up, Jess.

35:51.256 --> 35:52.958
Oh, babe.

35:56.028 --> 35:58.096
So, this is Santa Monica.

35:59.264 --> 36:01.064
Yeah, we've got the
famous pier here.

36:01.066 --> 36:02.766
Everyone's having
a whale of a time.

36:02.768 --> 36:05.502
We've got that wheel that you
see in the movies up there.

36:05.504 --> 36:08.138
But the view here is
actually really gorgeous.

36:08.140 --> 36:09.273
And then we've got these guys.

36:09.275 --> 36:12.042
Oh, it still
tastes so disgusting.

36:12.044 --> 36:14.110
Hey, babe, how's
the vlogging going?

36:14.112 --> 36:15.011
You happy with it?

36:15.013 --> 36:16.280
Yeah, I'm
really happy with it.

36:16.282 --> 36:18.182
I've got some great
stuff to edit.

36:18.184 --> 36:20.217
Especially that fight earlier.

36:20.219 --> 36:22.219
Yeah, I know, that
was unreal, babe.

36:22.221 --> 36:24.288
Jess, hon, was that a fight?

36:24.290 --> 36:25.722
Jess.

36:25.724 --> 36:27.224
You know, I've
never seen anyone

36:27.226 --> 36:28.893
on their phone as
much as you are.

36:28.895 --> 36:30.928
I'm just checking us in.

36:30.930 --> 36:32.663
Besides, it's not
every day I get

36:32.665 --> 36:34.198
to come to California, is it?

36:34.200 --> 36:37.201
So the whole world needs to
see how awesome my life is.

36:37.203 --> 36:39.303
I'm kidding, if you say so.

36:39.305 --> 36:40.237
It is getting
really late though now, guys.

36:40.239 --> 36:42.106
I think we should head off.

36:42.108 --> 36:44.241
Yeah, Brandon, we
better head off together.

36:44.243 --> 36:46.143
Excuse me.

36:46.145 --> 36:48.147
Where do you think
you're going, mister?

36:49.216 --> 36:50.147
Back to our hotel?

36:50.149 --> 36:51.149
Um, no.

36:51.151 --> 36:52.252
You're coming with me.

36:53.786 --> 36:56.288
- Um, what about you?
- Depends.

36:56.290 --> 36:57.888
What are your plans?

36:57.890 --> 36:59.324
On what?

36:59.326 --> 37:01.059
What are my options?

37:01.061 --> 37:02.062
- Well.
- Oh.

37:03.796 --> 37:07.099
- All right then, all right.
- Party it up.

37:07.101 --> 37:09.935
- Party it up.
- Come on, let's go.

37:09.937 --> 37:11.903
- All right.
- Go ahead.

37:11.905 --> 37:13.205
- Yeah.
- You ladies lead the way.

37:13.207 --> 37:14.639
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

37:14.641 --> 37:15.907
Let's do it.

37:15.909 --> 37:16.842
I don't even
know where I'm going.

37:16.844 --> 37:17.642
Let's go, keep walking.

37:17.644 --> 37:18.310
Let's go this way.

37:23.217 --> 37:24.918
Sh, guys.

37:25.986 --> 37:26.820
Sh.

37:28.256 --> 37:29.322
Okay, this is the
plan, this is the plan.

37:29.324 --> 37:31.190
We go into the kitchen.

37:31.192 --> 37:34.593
We find alcohol and
then we're gonna party.

37:46.875 --> 37:48.274
Guys, this isn't...

37:48.276 --> 37:49.675
Please.

37:49.677 --> 37:50.311
Lisa.

37:52.347 --> 37:53.346
Oh my god, who cares?

37:53.348 --> 37:55.081
- We'll replace it.
- We'll replace it, will we?

37:55.083 --> 37:56.182
Fine, I will.

37:56.184 --> 37:58.851
Why are you so boring?

38:13.701 --> 38:14.935
Please.

38:14.937 --> 38:17.639
Do you even know what that is?

38:18.808 --> 38:22.176
- We should just light it up.
- After you by tomorrow.

38:22.178 --> 38:24.680
Who cares, who cares?

38:26.415 --> 38:28.184
Such a gorgeous view.

38:29.952 --> 38:31.218
Do you know what?

38:31.220 --> 38:32.420
Actually, I don't mind
being here on my own.

38:32.422 --> 38:33.689
Peace and quiet.

38:35.024 --> 38:36.859
Except Matthew, I
wish you were here.

38:38.727 --> 38:40.863
It's like the city sparkles.

38:43.433 --> 38:46.301
We got this,
bro, let's do it.

38:51.341 --> 38:55.343
Come on in, come
on, come on in, come on.

38:55.345 --> 38:59.214
You guys are fucking
out of your minds.

38:59.216 --> 39:00.684
Fucking really.

39:01.418 --> 39:03.351
- Get in, come on.
- Get in here.

39:03.353 --> 39:06.254
It's not that cold, get
in here, it's not that cold.

39:06.256 --> 39:08.756
Are you feeling better?

39:21.805 --> 39:23.072
Hi, guys.

39:23.074 --> 39:25.007
So I just wanted to do a
quick introduction video

39:25.009 --> 39:28.244
to mine and Matthew's
engagement party.

39:29.779 --> 39:31.779
Are you fucking kidding me?

39:31.781 --> 39:33.748
Police today are searching

39:33.750 --> 39:37.753
for the man they're
calling the Cryptic Killer.

39:37.755 --> 39:40.156
The death toll is now
up to eight women.

39:40.158 --> 39:42.791
And even though the killer
likes to leave clues

39:42.793 --> 39:47.798
for the police, the FBI
still do not have any idea

39:49.033 --> 39:51.468
who's behind these
gruesome murders.

39:51.470 --> 39:54.271
They're asking for
anyone with any...

39:54.273 --> 39:56.739
This is exactly what
I have to put up with.

39:56.741 --> 39:58.143
So fucking selfish.

40:01.779 --> 40:03.846
Hi, guys, good morning from LA

40:03.848 --> 40:05.482
and I just wanna show
you this lovely dress

40:05.484 --> 40:06.849
from London Boutique.

40:06.851 --> 40:08.784
Thank you so much for this.

40:08.786 --> 40:10.086
Perfect for my LA
trip, actually.

40:10.088 --> 40:11.821
And great for the
summer as well.

40:11.823 --> 40:14.090
If you would like this
dress or something similar,

40:14.092 --> 40:16.793
please see the link

40:16.795 --> 40:20.230

40:20.232 --> 40:23.068
Right, let's go
and find the girls.

40:24.770 --> 40:25.436
Jess.

40:25.438 --> 40:26.738
Lisa.

40:27.440 --> 40:29.072
Come on, get up.

40:29.074 --> 40:31.174
Get up.

40:31.176 --> 40:32.376
All right, Sophie.

40:32.378 --> 40:33.810
Come on, if we wanna
get to Malibu, we need to go.

40:33.812 --> 40:35.779
It's 12 o'clock already.

40:35.781 --> 40:37.417
- Come on.
- Bloody hell.

40:41.787 --> 40:43.755
Great, looking fresh.

40:47.994 --> 40:49.829
Come on, get up, Lisa.

40:51.130 --> 40:52.732
Why are you just lying there?

40:55.868 --> 40:58.135
Just give us five
minutes will you, Soph?

40:58.137 --> 40:59.538
I've already given
you five minutes, Jess.

40:59.540 --> 41:01.074
It's 12 o'clock.

41:03.109 --> 41:04.110
Oh, you are joking.

41:05.579 --> 41:06.944
No no no no no, babe,
don't go there, it's blocked.

41:06.946 --> 41:08.249
Go use mine.

41:10.517 --> 41:11.784
Get it up, babe, get it up.

41:13.587 --> 41:16.056
Do you think she's
gonna be all right to drive?

41:17.057 --> 41:18.889
She'll be fine
in half an hour.

41:18.891 --> 41:20.459
She's got food poisoning.

41:20.461 --> 41:21.560
Food poisoning?

41:21.562 --> 41:24.263
More like alcohol poisoning
the amount you two drank.

41:24.265 --> 41:26.867
All right, I'm gonna go
wait in the car, hurry up.

41:30.204 --> 41:31.903
Hi, guys.

41:31.905 --> 41:34.339
So, it's day two in LA and
what a beautiful day it is.

41:34.341 --> 41:36.441
But as you can see, the girls
aren't here to enjoy it,

41:36.443 --> 41:38.377
because it's nearly 12 o'clock
and they're still in bed.

41:38.379 --> 41:40.078
Surprise, surprise, hungover.

41:40.080 --> 41:42.014
But at least I can enjoy
this beautiful view.

41:42.016 --> 41:42.948
Look at that.

41:42.950 --> 41:45.152
What a waste of my time
bringing them here.

41:46.621 --> 41:48.920
Anyway, besides that, I'm a
little bit worried about Lisa.

41:48.922 --> 41:51.023
She's been really ill
the last few days.

41:51.025 --> 41:53.892
Although drugs and alcohol
probably didn't help last night.

41:53.894 --> 41:54.961
But I definitely
don't think I'll be

41:54.963 --> 41:56.262
going on holiday
with them again.

41:56.264 --> 41:59.098
Sorry, guys, but I just
don't think I will.

41:59.100 --> 42:00.568
Oh, there's a note on our car.

42:04.072 --> 42:04.906
That's weird.

42:08.176 --> 42:09.578
Here she comes, finally.

42:16.385 --> 42:18.251
Oh, I'll get your
case then, shall I?

42:18.253 --> 42:19.986
Jess, where's Lisa?

42:19.988 --> 42:20.822
She's coming.

42:24.893 --> 42:25.528
So moody.

42:37.440 --> 42:39.473
- Soph.
- Yeah?

42:39.475 --> 42:41.575
Promise you won't tell
Lisa if I tell you something.

42:41.577 --> 42:44.111
No, of course
not, what is it?

42:44.113 --> 42:48.048
Well, after you
left, I went into the bathroom

42:48.050 --> 42:50.184
and I found a pregnancy
test in the bin.

42:50.186 --> 42:51.420
It was positive.

42:53.222 --> 42:54.023
Shit.

42:56.025 --> 42:58.058
Whose would it be?

42:58.060 --> 42:59.059
I dunno,

42:59.061 --> 43:01.229
but she said slept with
a lot of guys in Ibiza.

43:01.231 --> 43:02.464
Well, that
would explain why she's

43:02.466 --> 43:04.064
been so sick the
last few days then.

43:04.066 --> 43:05.068
She's pregnant.

43:06.370 --> 43:07.702
Should I say something?

43:07.704 --> 43:09.137
No.

43:09.139 --> 43:11.139
No, it would just make
her feel really awkward

43:11.141 --> 43:11.973
for the rest of the trip.

43:11.975 --> 43:13.108
It would ruin it.

43:13.110 --> 43:15.977
We'll talk to her when we
get back to the UK, yeah?

43:15.979 --> 43:17.178
Yeah.

43:17.180 --> 43:19.647
Yeah, okay.

43:19.649 --> 43:21.149
- Who could be the...
- Sh, she's coming.

43:21.151 --> 43:22.052
She's coming.

43:29.059 --> 43:31.460
Aw hello, you, you all right?

43:31.462 --> 43:32.996
Yes, I'm fine.

43:44.609 --> 43:45.474
Are you all
right to drive, babe?

43:45.476 --> 43:47.209
Yes, I'm fine.

43:47.211 --> 43:48.043
Just hungover.

43:48.045 --> 43:49.412
Nothing I can't handle.

43:49.414 --> 43:51.113
So is it
just you two then?

43:51.115 --> 43:53.015
Where are the studs?

43:53.017 --> 43:54.083
They had to pick up their car.

43:54.085 --> 43:56.185
They had some friends
flying into LA this morning.

43:56.187 --> 43:57.253
How predictable.

43:57.255 --> 43:58.988
I knew they were gonna do that.

43:58.990 --> 43:59.756
Well, it
doesn't matter, does it?

43:59.758 --> 44:01.223
I mean, I got what I wanted, so.

44:01.225 --> 44:02.093
Yeah, I know.

44:03.562 --> 44:05.194
You were listening?

44:05.196 --> 44:07.231
Lisa, I did not
have to listen.

44:08.634 --> 44:09.466
Look.

44:10.702 --> 44:12.602
Oh my god, that
is so embarrassing.

44:12.604 --> 44:14.204
Turn that off, delete it now.

44:14.206 --> 44:15.004
So which one
of you were screaming

44:15.006 --> 44:16.440
like you were being
murdered then?

44:16.442 --> 44:17.441
You can hear her
in the back there.

44:17.443 --> 44:18.542
Totally freaked me out as well.

44:18.544 --> 44:19.476
What?

44:19.478 --> 44:21.144
He didn't exactly hold back,

44:21.146 --> 44:22.212
so I was just letting him
know I was having a good time.

44:22.214 --> 44:23.246
Jess, I
don't wanna know.

44:23.248 --> 44:24.483
I bet you do either.

44:25.617 --> 44:28.018
You are such a
bad influence on me.

44:28.020 --> 44:29.286
Never again.

44:29.288 --> 44:30.153
Me?

44:30.155 --> 44:32.088
You're the one that
got it all started.

44:32.090 --> 44:33.791
Seriously, girls, I
can't deal with this today.

44:33.793 --> 44:35.158
Please don't start.

44:35.160 --> 44:37.695
Are we going via Malibu or not?

44:37.697 --> 44:40.598
Sure, I mean I still wanna
go if Lisa's up for driving.

44:40.600 --> 44:42.265
Yeah, I just think I still

44:42.267 --> 44:44.167
might be a bit too
drunk to drive.

44:44.169 --> 44:45.335
No, you'll be all right,
babe, just take it slow.

44:45.337 --> 44:46.571
Yeah, just
take your time.

44:46.573 --> 44:48.205
I mean, it's really not
that far to San Fran.

44:48.207 --> 44:50.374
We're not in any rush.

44:50.376 --> 44:52.577
Can you pass me that
water please, babe?

44:52.579 --> 44:54.245
- We haven't got any, babe.
- Here we are.

44:54.247 --> 44:58.249
So, before we go, which one
of you put this on the car

44:58.251 --> 44:59.652
as some sort of joke then?

45:01.387 --> 45:03.354
It wasn't me.

45:03.356 --> 45:05.323
Don't look at
me, I didn't do that.

45:05.325 --> 45:07.258
Probably just the guys,
a prank or something.

45:07.260 --> 45:08.094
Maybe.

45:09.062 --> 45:10.495
Oh, speak of the devil.

45:10.497 --> 45:13.364
He's just accepted
my friend request.

45:13.366 --> 45:15.368
Got a little comment on my post.

45:16.770 --> 45:18.637
Lisa, did you
actually find your phone?

45:18.639 --> 45:19.571
No.

45:19.573 --> 45:20.772
Fuck knows where I left it.

45:20.774 --> 45:22.206
Probably on the
plane or something.

45:22.208 --> 45:23.542
Shit, I'd
be right upset.

45:23.544 --> 45:25.243
You all right about it?

45:25.245 --> 45:28.179
Yeah, just sad about all my
photos and numbers and that.

45:28.181 --> 45:29.715
Oh actually, can I use your
phone to call my dad later?

45:29.717 --> 45:31.115
Yeah, of
course you can.

45:31.117 --> 45:32.284
Lost your
booty call is more like.

45:34.388 --> 45:36.421
Are you
all right, Jess?

45:36.423 --> 45:38.757
Are you okay,
little miss driver?

45:38.759 --> 45:40.225
Yeah, I'm powering through.

45:40.227 --> 45:41.827
But we should just give
Malibu a miss, girls.

45:41.829 --> 45:44.129
Yeah, that's
fine by me for today.

45:44.131 --> 45:45.566
Jess, is that all
right with you?

45:47.268 --> 45:48.701
- Jess?
- What, sorry, what?

45:48.703 --> 45:50.168
We're gonna give
Malibu a miss,

45:50.170 --> 45:51.336
since she's still
not feeling great.

45:51.338 --> 45:52.739
Yeah, fine,
whatever, I'm easy.

45:52.741 --> 45:54.308
- We know.
- Hilarious.

45:55.644 --> 45:58.478
Oh my god, you've
got to be kidding me, no.

45:58.480 --> 45:59.746
What?

45:59.748 --> 46:01.447
The sat map's
just added four hours

46:01.449 --> 46:02.315
onto our journey.

46:02.317 --> 46:03.650
Now it's eight hours
instead of four.

46:03.652 --> 46:05.218
- Four hours?
- Are you joking?

46:05.220 --> 46:06.486
It's just a completely
red what we're in now.

46:06.488 --> 46:07.287
It just goes on for the
whole route pretty much.

46:07.289 --> 46:08.421
Well,
what are we doing?

46:08.423 --> 46:09.722
I'm not sitting in this traffic.

46:09.724 --> 46:11.190
It's fine,
I'll pay for us to stay

46:11.192 --> 46:12.592
at a motel or hotel
thing for the night.

46:12.594 --> 46:13.760
- Jessica, Google somewhere.
- Yeah, yeah.

46:13.762 --> 46:15.495
I'll have a look, yeah.

46:15.497 --> 46:17.797
Cheers.

46:17.799 --> 46:19.833
- What?
- What now?

46:19.835 --> 46:22.368
I just got a text
off that random number again.

46:22.370 --> 46:23.670
Again,
what does it say?

46:23.672 --> 46:24.604
Same as last time.

46:24.606 --> 46:26.774
A bunch of just random numbers.

46:26.776 --> 46:27.841
Sophie, just delete it.

46:27.843 --> 46:29.475
It's probably just spam.

46:29.477 --> 46:30.678
Yeah.

46:30.680 --> 46:32.546
Girls, should we stop for
coffee while we're stuck anyway?

46:32.548 --> 46:35.148
- Oh my god, please, yes.
- Yeah, that'd be nice.

46:35.150 --> 46:36.517
Be good.

46:36.519 --> 46:39.820
- Look at this view.
- This scenery is insane.

46:39.822 --> 46:42.090
- Look at it.
- It's so dramatic.

46:44.293 --> 46:46.226
- What's wrong?
- You've got to be kidding me.

46:46.228 --> 46:48.462
- What, you got another text?
- Yeah.

46:48.464 --> 46:49.930
- A bunch of numbers again?
- No.

46:49.932 --> 46:53.400
It says the person who
buys me doesn't need me.

46:53.402 --> 46:56.570
The person who makes
me doesn't want me.

46:56.572 --> 46:59.573
And the person who uses
me can't appreciate me.

46:59.575 --> 47:00.775
What am I?

47:00.777 --> 47:02.209
What?

47:02.211 --> 47:04.246
All right, someone
clearly has no life.

47:05.481 --> 47:09.283
The person who uses
me can't appreciate me.

47:09.285 --> 47:10.485
It's a riddle.

47:10.487 --> 47:11.418
- A riddle?
- Yeah.

47:11.420 --> 47:12.921
I used to do these all the time.

47:12.923 --> 47:14.856
Oh, bloody hell,
Riddler on the Roof.

47:19.195 --> 47:23.266
Well, typey,
typey, Ms. Mezner's got it.

47:24.501 --> 47:25.900
What did you just say?

47:25.902 --> 47:29.604
- Ms. Mezner.
- It's Mensa, you idiot.

47:29.606 --> 47:31.974
Oh, I
thought it was Mezner.

47:31.976 --> 47:33.341
Well,
you're clearly not

47:33.343 --> 47:34.509
in the top percentage, are ya?

47:34.511 --> 47:36.213
Well,
leave me alone, Lis.

47:37.547 --> 47:40.248
- I got it right.
- What was the answer, babe?

47:40.250 --> 47:41.653
- It's a coffin.
- What?

47:42.519 --> 47:43.853
Oh, that is so creepy.

47:43.855 --> 47:45.788
Who would text you that?

47:45.790 --> 47:47.456
I don't know.

47:47.458 --> 47:48.858
I reckon it's someone
back home winding you up.

47:48.860 --> 47:51.360
Yeah, I hope
you're right, Lis.

47:51.362 --> 47:52.561
- Oh shit.
- What?

47:52.563 --> 47:53.863
- I just bloody...
- Jess.

47:53.865 --> 47:55.665
- Be careful with my camera.
- All right.

47:55.667 --> 47:56.932
Calm down, Sophie.

48:00.972 --> 48:02.571
What?

48:02.573 --> 48:03.839
- Make a loop?
- Yeah.

48:03.841 --> 48:05.641
Lis, we just
passed a gas station.

48:05.643 --> 48:06.575
I know, I know, I know.

48:06.577 --> 48:07.677
We're gonna have to
just hit the next one.

48:07.679 --> 48:08.579
And I need some snacks.

48:09.647 --> 48:11.681
She needs some
snacks, of course she does.

48:11.683 --> 48:13.683
Oh my god.

48:13.685 --> 48:16.585
Lis, can you do the
windscreen wipers, please?

48:16.587 --> 48:19.588
No, babes, we were out of
that water about five miles ago.

48:19.590 --> 48:21.323
You are kidding me,
you know it's illegal here?

48:21.325 --> 48:22.726
- You serious?
- Yes.

48:22.728 --> 48:25.562
- Oh, now it's illegal.
- Oh no.

48:25.564 --> 48:26.730
Mountain police.

48:26.732 --> 48:29.599
Oh, the mountain police.

48:29.601 --> 48:30.867
How was your trip to LA?

48:30.869 --> 48:34.773
Oh, we got arrested
because we had no water.

48:35.774 --> 48:37.407
Oh my god.

48:37.409 --> 48:38.341
Oh my god.

48:38.343 --> 48:39.943
- What is that?
- Oh my god.

48:39.945 --> 48:42.279
Yeah, that
sounds like a flat tire.

48:42.281 --> 48:44.548
- Yeah, shit.
- Lis, pull over up here.

48:44.550 --> 48:45.718
- No way.
- Please.

48:46.785 --> 48:48.886
Oh great, no water, flat tire.

48:48.888 --> 48:50.890
Yeah, we're gonna have
to pull over here, guys.

48:54.761 --> 48:55.860
Oh, emergency stopping only.

48:55.862 --> 48:58.497
Well, yup, this definitely
is an emergency, people.

49:04.637 --> 49:05.472
Oh.

49:07.540 --> 49:09.676
- Well?
- Sake.

49:10.744 --> 49:13.346
- Yup, it's flat.
- Great.

49:14.347 --> 49:15.613
What are we gonna do now then?

49:15.615 --> 49:16.414
Well, did they give us
like an emergency number

49:16.416 --> 49:17.548
to call or something?

49:17.550 --> 49:19.517
Yeah, they left it
on the sheet they gave you.

49:19.519 --> 49:20.520
Hold on.

49:29.529 --> 49:31.395
You found it?

49:31.397 --> 49:32.798
It's not in my bag.

49:32.800 --> 49:33.899
Huh?

49:33.901 --> 49:35.468
What did we do with it?

49:37.505 --> 49:38.704
We?

49:38.706 --> 49:39.872
Lis, you were the
one who had it last

49:39.874 --> 49:40.773
when we left the rental office.

49:40.775 --> 49:43.642
No, I gave it to
Jess when I walked out.

49:43.644 --> 49:44.979
- Oh my god.
- No, you didn't.

49:46.113 --> 49:47.646
Yes, I did, you're
just always losing shit

49:47.648 --> 49:48.847
and then blaming other people.

49:48.849 --> 49:50.516
Oh my god, Lisa,
what the hell?

49:50.518 --> 49:51.850
No, I didn't, and you're
a fine one to talk.

49:51.852 --> 49:54.586
You can't keep a boyfriend
for longer than a week.

49:54.588 --> 49:55.788
What did you just say to me?

49:55.790 --> 49:56.922
I think you heard me, Lisa.

49:56.924 --> 49:59.058
You have been
winding me up all day.

49:59.060 --> 50:00.592
- Great.
- Fighting's not gonna help.

50:00.594 --> 50:01.527
Is it?

50:01.529 --> 50:02.929
And now my nose is bleeding.

50:02.931 --> 50:04.964
I didn't mean to hit you
in the face did I, Lisa?

50:04.966 --> 50:06.966
Oh, stop
being dense, shush.

50:06.968 --> 50:07.901
Honestly.

50:07.903 --> 50:10.003
We gotta get this sorted out.

50:10.005 --> 50:10.837
What?

50:10.839 --> 50:12.071
Stalk someone down.

50:12.073 --> 50:13.540
I don't know, Soph,
someone's gonna stop.

50:13.542 --> 50:14.707
We're three girls,
for Christ's sake.

50:14.709 --> 50:16.042
You do know what,
that is not a bad idea, Jess.

50:16.044 --> 50:17.409
But for now, can you
two just make up?

50:17.411 --> 50:18.778
'Cause I am so sick and tired

50:18.780 --> 50:20.413
of you both constantly arguing.

50:20.415 --> 50:21.883
You're ruining
the whole holiday.

50:24.686 --> 50:26.820
I'm sorry, Soph.

50:26.822 --> 50:28.021
Sorry, Soph.

50:28.023 --> 50:29.789
Right, okay,
well let's take it

50:29.791 --> 50:31.758
in turns to flag someone down.

50:31.760 --> 50:32.859
But right now, Jess,
can you hold this?

50:32.861 --> 50:34.861
I'm gonna go take Lisa
somewhere to clear her nose up.

50:34.863 --> 50:36.096
Where are
you gonna do that?

50:36.098 --> 50:37.831
- There was a restroom.
- I can go on my own.

50:37.833 --> 50:40.669
No, there was a
restroom about half a mile back.

50:47.777 --> 50:51.612
So, hello to
Sophie's fan group.

50:51.614 --> 50:56.050
This is Jess and we are
reporting live from the side

50:56.052 --> 50:58.619
of the road because
we've broken down

50:58.621 --> 51:00.554
and we have a flat tire.

51:00.556 --> 51:01.789
Awesome.

51:01.791 --> 51:04.058
But luckily we have
this total babe

51:04.060 --> 51:05.826
who is helping us fix our tire.

51:05.828 --> 51:07.061
This is his car.

51:07.063 --> 51:09.663
The traditional
American Mustang.

51:09.665 --> 51:11.866
And as you can see, I have
matched myself perfectly

51:11.868 --> 51:14.668
to the vehicle just
for your own viewing.

51:14.670 --> 51:16.204
Bit of black and
gold going on here.

51:16.206 --> 51:18.073
So yeah, pretty much that's it.

51:18.075 --> 51:21.042
I'm gonna go show you our
little cowboy over here.

51:21.044 --> 51:22.112
Fixing our tire.

51:23.947 --> 51:26.447
Well hi there, cowboy,
what's going on?

51:26.449 --> 51:27.084
Hey, hi.

51:28.819 --> 51:32.756
So, we stupidly did
not check for a spare tire.

51:33.991 --> 51:35.657
You know.

51:35.659 --> 51:37.092
Don't worry, you're
not the first to do that.

51:37.094 --> 51:39.094
Oh hey, girlies.

51:39.096 --> 51:40.762
This is the lovely Jake.

51:40.764 --> 51:41.930
- Oh, hi.
- Hey, how are y'all?

51:41.932 --> 51:42.964
He's helping
us fix our tire.

51:42.966 --> 51:44.466
- Ah.
- We're all good.

51:44.468 --> 51:45.667
So it was just
a puncture then, yeah?

51:45.669 --> 51:46.935
Sure was.

51:46.937 --> 51:48.503
You had a few nails
stuck in your tire.

51:48.505 --> 51:49.571
Nails?

51:49.573 --> 51:50.772
Yeah.

51:50.774 --> 51:51.974
How the
hell did that happen?

51:51.976 --> 51:52.942
Ah, it's a common
thing, really.

51:52.944 --> 51:54.542
They fall off the back
of trucks and stuff.

51:54.544 --> 51:55.744
Really?

51:55.746 --> 51:56.245
People just come
along and scoop them up.

51:56.247 --> 51:57.713
It happens.

51:57.715 --> 51:59.984
God, never heard
of that before.

52:01.152 --> 52:02.885
- Amazing.
- So, where you girls headed?

52:02.887 --> 52:04.923
We are going to San Francisco.

52:06.024 --> 52:07.657
- San Fran, huh?
- Have you been there?

52:07.659 --> 52:08.925
Yep, sure have.

52:08.927 --> 52:10.893
- I have family in San Fran.
- Really?

52:10.895 --> 52:12.595
As you can tell, I'm
not from around here.

52:12.597 --> 52:13.829
Yeah,
whereabouts you from?

52:13.831 --> 52:16.098
- I'm from Texas.
- Texas, cowboy.

52:16.100 --> 52:17.267
Oh, I love Texas.

52:17.269 --> 52:18.534
Whereabouts?

52:18.536 --> 52:19.938
A small town near Austin.

52:20.972 --> 52:22.172
Nice.

52:22.174 --> 52:24.174
I like The Real
Housewives of Texas.

52:24.176 --> 52:25.242
So, what you
doing in Cali then,

52:25.244 --> 52:27.812
apart from helping strange
women with their car?

52:29.048 --> 52:32.615
Well, I just come out
here for a little road trip

52:32.617 --> 52:34.583
and picking up some weed.

52:34.585 --> 52:36.720
- Nice.
- Any of you girls smoke?

52:36.722 --> 52:38.121
- No, no, thank you.
- Eh.

52:38.123 --> 52:40.157
You more than me, babe.

52:40.159 --> 52:41.158
Shouldn't, but I will.

52:41.160 --> 52:42.159
It's legal here anyway, innit?

52:42.161 --> 52:43.894
Knock yourself out.

52:43.896 --> 52:45.062
Yeah, it's legal, so why not?

52:45.064 --> 52:46.930
It's all
legal here, ma'am, yes.

52:46.932 --> 52:48.732
Not legal in England.

52:48.734 --> 52:49.967
Well, it's not the worst place

52:49.969 --> 52:51.735
in the world to stop, is it?

52:51.737 --> 52:53.739
I mean, that view is
pretty spectacular.

52:54.606 --> 52:55.908
Oh, bloody hell.

52:58.244 --> 52:59.179
Good, huh?

53:00.080 --> 53:01.179
What a rockstar.

53:01.181 --> 53:02.180
I think we should probably go.

53:02.182 --> 53:03.647
Do you think so, girls?

53:03.649 --> 53:05.083
You can keep that,
that's a souvenir.

53:05.085 --> 53:07.251
Ah, thank you, dude.

53:07.253 --> 53:08.086
You're welcome.

53:08.088 --> 53:09.253
It was nothing.

53:09.255 --> 53:10.721
Anyway, enjoy your road trip.

53:10.723 --> 53:11.923
Thank you for your help.

53:11.925 --> 53:13.226
- And you, girls.
- Yep, thanks.

53:21.301 --> 53:26.139
- Aw, check out my souvenir.
- That's cool, very nice.

53:27.640 --> 53:28.573
So, where you girls staying?

53:28.575 --> 53:30.742
You scared the hell out of me.

53:30.744 --> 53:31.909
Didn't mean to scare you.

53:31.911 --> 53:34.279
Well, we're going
to that motel.

53:34.281 --> 53:36.047
Oh, I can't remember.

53:36.049 --> 53:37.316
Some motel I Googled.

53:37.318 --> 53:38.850
Just up the road, really.

53:38.852 --> 53:39.853
A really quick stop.

53:41.055 --> 53:43.155
All right, girls,
I'll see you around.

53:43.157 --> 53:46.258
Thanks so much
again, take care.

53:46.260 --> 53:47.259
Aw, bless.

53:47.261 --> 53:48.193
Where did you find him?

53:48.195 --> 53:49.328
Did he literally just stop?

53:49.330 --> 53:50.496
Yeah, I mean, I was just like,

53:50.498 --> 53:53.098
not long after you guys left,
I was just waggling my legs

53:53.100 --> 53:54.299
on the road and...

53:54.301 --> 53:55.200
Did you have to
get your tits out or?

53:55.202 --> 53:56.235
Maybe.

53:57.371 --> 53:58.804
Look, I'm sorry for earlier.

53:58.806 --> 54:00.039
I'm well aware I
was being a dick.

54:00.041 --> 54:01.273
Yeah, babe, I'm really sorry.

54:01.275 --> 54:03.809
I totally like
went crazy on you.

54:03.811 --> 54:05.311
I'm really sorry.

54:05.313 --> 54:06.211
Didn't mean to do it.

54:06.213 --> 54:07.946
Let's get
rolling then, girls.

54:07.948 --> 54:10.682
Yeah.

54:10.684 --> 54:11.917
Bloody hell.

54:11.919 --> 54:12.918
Jesus, look
at that rim spin.

54:12.920 --> 54:15.190
In the red.

54:20.195 --> 54:22.295
- Only in America, right?
- I know.

54:22.297 --> 54:26.068
- Looks like an angry car.
- Sounds like an angry car.

54:28.303 --> 54:33.308
Wow.

54:37.746 --> 54:39.913
That guy was weird, wasn't he?

54:39.915 --> 54:40.747
What?

54:40.749 --> 54:42.082
He was all right.

54:42.084 --> 54:43.650
Jess, the
guy was a creep.

54:43.652 --> 54:45.286
Oh my god, you
guys are so soft.

54:45.288 --> 54:46.119
He was fine.

54:46.121 --> 54:47.754
Well then,
why was he asking

54:47.756 --> 54:48.988
where we were staying then?

54:48.990 --> 54:50.391
Well, maybe he wanted
to make conversation

54:50.393 --> 54:52.293
with you, Sophie, chill.

54:52.295 --> 54:54.295
I personally think we should
turn around and go back to LA

54:54.297 --> 54:56.763
'cause today has just
been a nightmare.

54:56.765 --> 54:58.833
Are you
kidding me, Lisa?

54:58.835 --> 55:00.401
The whole reason why
we've come out here

55:00.403 --> 55:01.836
is so I can go to this fan meet

55:01.838 --> 55:03.104
and greet all the
way in San Fran.

55:03.106 --> 55:04.105
We're not turning
back now, all right?

55:04.107 --> 55:04.874
Okay, fine.

55:07.877 --> 55:09.679
Oh my god.

55:10.847 --> 55:12.379
What's wrong?

55:12.381 --> 55:14.416
I've just got a
text off your phone, Lis.

55:14.418 --> 55:15.816
Mine?

55:15.818 --> 55:17.151
What, are you joking?

55:17.153 --> 55:18.786
Tell me you're joking.

55:18.788 --> 55:21.021
How the hell has
someone got your phone?

55:21.023 --> 55:23.726
- Someone must have found it.
- Yeah, but who though?

55:25.462 --> 55:26.428
What's it
say, what's it say?

55:26.430 --> 55:27.329
Read it.

55:27.331 --> 55:29.697
It says I
am greater than God,

55:29.699 --> 55:31.466
more evil than the Devil.

55:31.468 --> 55:35.337
The poor have me,
the rich need me.

55:35.339 --> 55:38.206
If you eat me, you'll die.

55:38.208 --> 55:39.941
What am I?

55:39.943 --> 55:42.444
This is really starting
to freak me out now.

55:42.446 --> 55:43.812
Who the fuck is
sending these messages?

55:43.814 --> 55:45.280
What even is the
fucking answer anyway?

55:45.282 --> 55:47.415
Look out!

55:47.417 --> 55:49.019
Oh my god.

55:50.387 --> 55:52.421
Who the fuck
would just do that?

55:52.423 --> 55:55.458
Absolute
wanker, oh my god.

55:55.460 --> 55:57.192
Is everyone
all right, girls?

55:57.194 --> 55:58.327
- Oh my god.
- Yeah.

55:58.329 --> 56:00.263
God, my heart.

56:00.265 --> 56:03.000
Sorry, girls, I literally
didn't know how to save that.

56:04.402 --> 56:06.402
Honestly, it's just
one thing after another.

56:06.404 --> 56:07.738
That scared the
shit out of me.

56:09.073 --> 56:10.772
There's something seriously
not right here, girls.

56:10.774 --> 56:11.941
I'm sorry, but...

56:11.943 --> 56:12.875
I just wanna
get out of here.

56:12.877 --> 56:13.876
Can we just please just go?

56:13.878 --> 56:14.812
Just carry on?

56:18.850 --> 56:19.784
Oh my god.

56:23.755 --> 56:25.454
I think we
should call the police.

56:25.456 --> 56:27.256
And what exactly is
that gonna do, Sophie?

56:27.258 --> 56:28.458
They're not gonna believe us.

56:28.460 --> 56:29.660
And even if they do,
they're not gonna trace

56:29.662 --> 56:33.463
some random ass guy sending
prank text messages, are they?

56:33.465 --> 56:34.864
Well, maybe it
was one of those two guys

56:34.866 --> 56:36.032
you were fucking last night.

56:36.034 --> 56:37.534
Oh shut up, Sophie.

56:37.536 --> 56:40.439
Just, all of you, just
let me drive in peace.

56:43.875 --> 56:45.509
♪ Wee oo wee oo woo

56:45.511 --> 56:48.212
♪ Wow wow wow

56:48.214 --> 56:49.513
You're gonna
see a roadrunner.

56:49.515 --> 56:51.248
- Meep meep.
- Tumbleweed, tumbleweed.

56:51.250 --> 56:53.817
- And draw.
- We could be terrible,

56:53.819 --> 56:55.552
terrible cowboys, girls.

56:55.554 --> 56:57.156
- Cowgirls.
- Shit.

56:58.290 --> 57:00.791
- What?
- Oh my god.

57:00.793 --> 57:02.027
Oh no, no.

57:03.262 --> 57:04.897
Oh fuck, what?

57:06.832 --> 57:09.833
The sat map said it's
literally .2 of a mile away.

57:09.835 --> 57:12.537
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't even care.

57:12.539 --> 57:14.004
I'm gonna get us
there on a flat.

57:14.006 --> 57:16.309
- Oh my god, our luck.
- We are not stopping.

57:17.377 --> 57:18.445
No, exactly.

57:20.813 --> 57:24.282
So, lightning does
strike twice then.

57:24.284 --> 57:25.316
But let's look on
the bright side,

57:25.318 --> 57:26.517
girls, at least we're here, eh?

57:26.519 --> 57:27.885
Yeah, but we haven't
got another spare.

57:27.887 --> 57:29.153
What do we do?

57:29.155 --> 57:30.388
I'm gonna
go into reception

57:30.390 --> 57:31.322
and ask them if they
can call someone out.

57:31.324 --> 57:32.257
Don't worry, I'll sort it.

57:32.259 --> 57:34.125
- Okay, girls?
- Okay.

57:34.127 --> 57:36.027
Right, I'm gonna go
in and ask and get the keys.

57:36.029 --> 57:37.596
Who's sleeping on
their own tonight?

57:37.598 --> 57:38.564
I'll sleep on my own.

57:38.566 --> 57:39.831
Are you all
right with that, Lis?

57:39.833 --> 57:40.965
Yeah, whatever.

57:40.967 --> 57:41.899
You need to come with me then,

57:41.901 --> 57:43.134
Jess, you gotta sign for yours.

57:43.136 --> 57:44.335
- Okay.
- Shall I take the camera?

57:44.337 --> 57:45.136
Yeah,
yeah, yeah, right.

57:45.138 --> 57:45.972
Thank you.

57:47.274 --> 57:48.873
Been trusted
with the camera.

57:48.875 --> 57:50.908
Oh look, there they are.

57:50.910 --> 57:53.079
Little Miss Riding
Hood and the evil twin.

57:58.052 --> 58:00.486
So, are we sorted?

58:00.488 --> 58:03.889
Yup, room eight and 15.

58:03.891 --> 58:05.924
He said to just go and
park around the back there,

58:05.926 --> 58:06.859
there's spaces there.

58:06.861 --> 58:08.994
No, babe, I
meant about the flat.

58:08.996 --> 58:11.263
Oh no, they can't get
anyone out till the morning.

58:11.265 --> 58:12.097
Great.

58:12.099 --> 58:12.931
What time?

58:12.933 --> 58:14.166
I dunno.

58:14.168 --> 58:16.101
- First thing, I guess.
- How hot was that guy?

58:16.103 --> 58:18.172
- Oh, what guy?
- The guy in reception.

58:19.140 --> 58:20.172
He wasn't that hot.

58:20.174 --> 58:21.874
Yeah he was, Soph, you would.

58:21.876 --> 58:23.042
I wouldn't.

58:23.044 --> 58:24.644
Oh, someone's got shy.

58:24.646 --> 58:26.879
- Windy.
- Why thank you, Lisa.

58:26.881 --> 58:29.316
I'm guessing there's no porter
service in the desert then.

58:29.318 --> 58:31.217
Only you, darling.

58:31.219 --> 58:34.220
Jesus, what have you
got in here, Sophie?

58:34.222 --> 58:35.288
It's Ryan.

58:35.290 --> 58:36.990
I didn't wanna leave him.

58:36.992 --> 58:38.525
I wouldn't actually put
it past you, you freak.

58:41.963 --> 58:43.630
- Oh god.
- Room 15, Jess.

58:43.632 --> 58:45.031
This is yours.

58:45.033 --> 58:47.202
I'm only one
row going on here.

58:49.237 --> 58:50.172
Don't film it.

58:51.540 --> 58:54.974
Oh, 70's vibing,
I likey, I likey.

58:54.976 --> 58:57.545
Oh damn, vintage.

58:57.547 --> 58:59.482
- Real classy.
- I like it.

59:01.384 --> 59:02.949
- Well.
- Well, actually.

59:02.951 --> 59:05.051
I really quite like it, no?

59:05.053 --> 59:06.119
Babe, you're the
one who chose it.

59:07.623 --> 59:09.055
Guilty.

59:09.057 --> 59:10.957
Shall we go and see
your room, ladies?

59:10.959 --> 59:14.962
- What was it?
- Room eight.

59:14.964 --> 59:17.064
Yeah, a couple
doors down, should be.

59:17.066 --> 59:18.699
It's not a
couple doors down.

59:18.701 --> 59:20.002
It's like 14 here.

59:21.204 --> 59:22.703
- Keep going.
- Jesus, it's ages.

59:22.705 --> 59:25.039
I'll have to catch a bus
to get to the bloody room.

59:29.178 --> 59:31.045
This one is much nicer.

59:31.047 --> 59:32.714
Oh, lemon cello.

59:32.716 --> 59:33.948
Lemon?

59:33.950 --> 59:35.218
Mustard more like, babe.

59:36.319 --> 59:39.186
Very interesting
combination of colors.

59:39.188 --> 59:41.356
We have the turquoise
and mustard.

59:41.358 --> 59:42.391
Very nice.

59:42.393 --> 59:44.226
- Art Deco.
- Mm, extremely.

59:44.228 --> 59:46.495
Oo, look at the TV, very cool.

59:46.497 --> 59:47.462
Vintage.

59:49.099 --> 59:51.166
Oh my goodness.

59:51.168 --> 59:52.634
Oh really, Lis?

59:52.636 --> 59:54.403
This song is so depressing.

59:54.405 --> 59:56.037
If you don't like it,
put your headphones in.

59:56.039 --> 59:58.740
No, I like this,
good choice, Lis.

59:58.742 --> 01:00:01.109
The bed's quite
comfortable, actually.

01:00:01.111 --> 01:00:03.044
- Useful.
- Here, give it here.

01:00:03.046 --> 01:00:04.179
Thank you.

01:00:04.181 --> 01:00:05.113
This place is all right

01:00:05.115 --> 01:00:06.081
though innit, for one night?

01:00:06.083 --> 01:00:08.216
Girls, that
journey has killed me.

01:00:08.218 --> 01:00:09.652
I'm so knackered.

01:00:09.654 --> 01:00:11.119
Yeah, after last
night, that doesn't surprise me.

01:00:13.090 --> 01:00:14.291
Shut up.

01:00:15.192 --> 01:00:16.659
What you doing there?

01:00:16.661 --> 01:00:18.528
Jess.

01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:19.729
Oh my god.

01:00:19.731 --> 01:00:23.533
- Your laugh is so evil.
- It's so, so evil.

01:00:23.535 --> 01:00:25.668
And where do you get all this
energy from all the time?

01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:27.236
You know, I might
invite that cute guy

01:00:27.238 --> 01:00:29.338
from reception over later
for a little nightcap

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:31.541
and you two lovebirds
crash for the night.

01:00:31.543 --> 01:00:33.142
Oo, well if
you wanna do that,

01:00:33.144 --> 01:00:34.076
I'd be quick if I was you.

01:00:34.078 --> 01:00:36.145
I reckon he changes over
for the night shift.

01:00:36.147 --> 01:00:37.313
Good point.

01:00:37.315 --> 01:00:38.514
Right, should
we go for a walk

01:00:38.516 --> 01:00:40.149
and leave this little
sleepy head to it?

01:00:40.151 --> 01:00:41.186
Yeah.

01:00:42.187 --> 01:00:44.187
- See you, girls.
- Bye, little sleepy girl.

01:00:44.189 --> 01:00:46.157
- Bye-bye.
- Night-night.

I've got a better version.

01:00:58.136 --> 01:00:59.101
Oh, of course you do.

01:00:59.103 --> 01:00:59.603
Do you even know what that is?

01:00:59.605 --> 01:01:01.338
No.

01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:02.339
It's the national anthem,
The Star Spangled Banner.

01:01:02.341 --> 01:01:05.175
- Actually.
- I've got a better one.

01:01:05.177 --> 01:01:06.410

So, we are in the
middle of a desert.

01:01:26.399 --> 01:01:28.566
Also, it feels like
we've left little miss...

01:01:28.568 --> 01:01:30.067
What are you doing?

01:01:30.069 --> 01:01:30.835
That's not really
my best angle, babe.

01:01:33.273 --> 01:01:35.607
We've left little miss
sleepy head in the motel room

01:01:35.609 --> 01:01:36.508
that this one chose.

01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:38.743
- It's...
- Beautiful.

01:01:38.745 --> 01:01:40.178
Yeah.

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:41.412
Vintage, original,
gorgeous, five stars.

01:01:41.414 --> 01:01:42.680
I'm not letting you
ever choose again ever.

01:01:42.682 --> 01:01:44.382
Don't thank me too much, guys.

01:01:44.384 --> 01:01:46.317
Look at the mountains,
they're all the way over there.

01:01:46.319 --> 01:01:47.185
These mountains?

01:01:47.187 --> 01:01:50.388
Oh, you're such a
ripping little dog.

01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:53.424
This is such a cute
little gas station.

01:01:53.426 --> 01:01:55.260
- Sophie.
- Hang on.

01:01:55.262 --> 01:01:57.696
I'm just filming the
gas station, Jess.

01:01:57.698 --> 01:01:59.798
Never get anything
like this in England.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:03.536
I am, literally smack bang
in the middle of nowhere.

01:02:03.538 --> 01:02:06.807
Sorry about her, she just
loves taking selfies.

01:02:08.409 --> 01:02:10.411
You kids and your
fucking cellphones.

01:02:11.312 --> 01:02:12.647
It's the worst generation ever.

01:02:14.715 --> 01:02:16.482
It's ruined so many
damn relationships.

01:02:16.484 --> 01:02:17.318
Ugh.

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:23.255
You know, vanity can
be a cruel mistress.

01:02:23.257 --> 01:02:24.356
- Jess.
- Hey.

01:02:24.358 --> 01:02:25.859
Jess,
come on, let's go.

01:02:25.861 --> 01:02:28.294
Matthew and his friends are
gonna be here any minute.

01:02:28.296 --> 01:02:30.462
You look fucking familiar.

01:02:30.464 --> 01:02:31.363
Come on, Jess.

01:02:31.365 --> 01:02:32.565
Hey, bitch, you
look fucking familiar.

01:02:32.567 --> 01:02:34.634
- Come on, come on.
- Quick.

01:02:34.636 --> 01:02:35.535
Where you going?

01:02:35.537 --> 01:02:36.803
Where you going?

01:02:36.805 --> 01:02:38.471
Jess, have
you seen this sink?

01:02:38.473 --> 01:02:40.239
Yeah, I
know, it's rank innit?

01:02:40.241 --> 01:02:40.874
It's gross.

01:02:40.876 --> 01:02:42.409
Look at that plughole.

01:02:42.411 --> 01:02:43.610
They haven't cleaned this
since the last people

01:02:43.612 --> 01:02:45.445
or the last 10 people.

01:02:46.381 --> 01:02:47.847
Do you think it would
be really mean of me

01:02:47.849 --> 01:02:49.382
if I gave them a bad review?

01:02:49.384 --> 01:02:50.884
No, babe,
they need a bad review.

01:02:50.886 --> 01:02:52.319
They need to turn
this place around.

01:02:52.321 --> 01:02:53.219
It's gross.

01:02:53.221 --> 01:02:54.421
Yeah, it is.

01:02:54.423 --> 01:02:55.789
Oh, by the way,
you gonna fill me in

01:02:55.791 --> 01:02:57.490
with your little episode
that you had earlier?

01:02:57.492 --> 01:02:59.559
I mean, that guy I
saw you talking to.

01:02:59.561 --> 01:03:00.794
Oh, I dunno who he was.

01:03:00.796 --> 01:03:03.496
Whoever he was, he was
an absolute psycho.

01:03:03.498 --> 01:03:04.932
A psycho?

01:03:04.934 --> 01:03:06.266
Jesus, Sophie, I swear you get

01:03:06.268 --> 01:03:08.568
the weirdest vibes up on guys.

01:03:08.570 --> 01:03:10.503
Jess, you saw the
way he spoke to us.

01:03:10.505 --> 01:03:11.706
He was just staring

01:03:11.708 --> 01:03:13.574
and looking at you
the whole entire time.

01:03:13.576 --> 01:03:14.942
And then when he spoke to me

01:03:14.944 --> 01:03:16.644
and I didn't answer,
he just snapped.

01:03:16.646 --> 01:03:18.345
Yeah, I guess that
is a bit weird actually.

01:03:18.347 --> 01:03:19.580
What was it he
said to you again?

01:03:19.582 --> 01:03:20.414
Well, it's not
really what he said.

01:03:20.416 --> 01:03:22.483
It's how he said it.

01:03:22.485 --> 01:03:23.718
Wouldn't be surprised
if it was him

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.519
who's been creeping us
out this whole time.

01:03:25.521 --> 01:03:26.420
Oh come on.

01:03:26.422 --> 01:03:28.289
I doubt that.

01:03:28.291 --> 01:03:30.825
You're probably just overthinking
things as usual, missy.

01:03:30.827 --> 01:03:33.962
I mean, babe, some people,
they're just like that, you know?

01:03:33.964 --> 01:03:35.630
They're just a bit weird.

01:03:35.632 --> 01:03:38.566
And especially around
here, it's full of weirdos.

01:03:38.568 --> 01:03:39.868
You should take it as a
compliment really, babe.

01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:41.903
I mean, you're hot stuff.

01:03:41.905 --> 01:03:43.571
We're hot stuff.

01:03:43.573 --> 01:03:45.774
And you can't really
blame a guy for staring.

01:03:45.776 --> 01:03:47.508
I mean, just look at me.

01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:48.476
Woo.

01:03:48.478 --> 01:03:49.978
Jess.

01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:52.380
I don't wanna see that,
nor does the camera.

01:03:52.382 --> 01:03:53.416
Sure you do.

01:03:54.585 --> 01:03:56.518
No, but I'm being serious.

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:58.520
I've got some weird
vibe going on now.

01:03:58.522 --> 01:04:01.423
You know what, maybe we
should just move on tonight.

01:04:01.425 --> 01:04:02.324
What?

01:04:02.326 --> 01:04:03.592
You are so silly.

01:04:03.594 --> 01:04:06.528
Honestly, babe,
we're gonna be fine.

01:04:06.530 --> 01:04:07.462
You're overthinking things.

01:04:07.464 --> 01:04:09.166
You've gone way too much.

01:04:09.967 --> 01:04:11.433
Can I have that towel, please?

01:04:11.435 --> 01:04:12.567
Where is it?

01:04:12.569 --> 01:04:13.936
Well, babe, it's
right by the side of you.

01:04:13.938 --> 01:04:15.972
- Oh, sorry.
- That's all right.

01:04:15.974 --> 01:04:17.408
Thanks, Soph.

01:04:19.677 --> 01:04:20.877
Right.

01:04:20.879 --> 01:04:22.845
But honestly, babe, we're gonna

01:04:22.847 --> 01:04:25.648
be absolutely fine here, okay?

01:04:25.650 --> 01:04:27.449
We're only here for one night.

01:04:27.451 --> 01:04:28.620
It'll be fine.

01:04:30.021 --> 01:04:30.953
Yeah, you're right.

01:04:30.955 --> 01:04:32.555
Of course I'm right.

01:04:32.557 --> 01:04:34.256
Anyway, are you hungry?

01:04:34.258 --> 01:04:35.725
Because I've got the
hungover munchies.

01:04:35.727 --> 01:04:38.695
So, what do you say we go
wake up Lis and get some food?

01:04:38.697 --> 01:04:39.996
Oh, I don't think
we should wake her up.

01:04:39.998 --> 01:04:41.531
She's so hungover, Jess.

01:04:41.533 --> 01:04:43.900
Oh yeah, probably
best not to, actually.

01:04:43.902 --> 01:04:44.834
All right, we'll just grab her

01:04:44.836 --> 01:04:46.536
a burger then should we, babe?

01:04:46.538 --> 01:04:47.570
Yeah, it shouldn't be
all that far, I don't think.

01:04:47.572 --> 01:04:48.504
Okay, cool.

01:04:48.506 --> 01:04:49.806
I'll get dressed then, we'll go.

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:56.646
Diner it said.

01:04:56.648 --> 01:04:58.916
Yeah, but
what would Lisa want?

01:04:58.918 --> 01:05:00.583
Can't choose anything.

01:05:00.585 --> 01:05:02.586
Well, if you say so.

01:05:02.588 --> 01:05:03.889
- Yeah.
- She's so fussy.

01:05:05.457 --> 01:05:06.590
What are you gonna get?

01:05:06.592 --> 01:05:09.960
Hm, I think I'll go for
the healthy option today.

01:05:09.962 --> 01:05:11.764
- Burger and fries?
- Hm, me too.

01:05:16.569 --> 01:05:19.672
Hi, a table
for two, please.

01:05:22.541 --> 01:05:23.574
Mm.

01:05:23.576 --> 01:05:26.343
Oh my god,
babe, you weren't joking.

01:05:26.345 --> 01:05:28.312
You're giving me indigestion
just looking at you.

01:05:28.314 --> 01:05:29.948
The salt is so good.

01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:31.448
Do you want to try some?

01:05:31.450 --> 01:05:33.717
No, oh, I
don't like hot stuff.

01:05:33.719 --> 01:05:35.385
Just Matt then, eh?

01:05:35.387 --> 01:05:36.453
Watch it, you.

01:05:36.455 --> 01:05:39.090
You've already had a fight
with one of us today.

01:05:39.092 --> 01:05:40.058
Yeah.

01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:45.362
Hm.

01:05:45.364 --> 01:05:47.565
The guys just uploaded
a photo of us.

01:05:47.567 --> 01:05:48.802
All hashtag hotties.

01:05:50.570 --> 01:05:51.803
Good one, that.

01:05:51.805 --> 01:05:53.774
- Not a bad pic.
- Not yet.

01:06:02.749 --> 01:06:03.750
- Fuck.
- What?

01:06:05.385 --> 01:06:06.118
Sophie.

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:07.820
It's that guy from earlier.

01:06:07.822 --> 01:06:09.454
Nice try, Jess.

01:06:09.456 --> 01:06:11.391
Sophie, I'm being serious.

01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:14.693
Where is he?

01:06:14.695 --> 01:06:16.764
Okay, don't make it obvious.

01:06:17.899 --> 01:06:20.735
He's sitting at
the bar behind you.

01:06:24.972 --> 01:06:26.839
He's staring
straight at us.

01:06:26.841 --> 01:06:28.808
Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:06:28.810 --> 01:06:30.075
He's staring right at us.

01:06:30.077 --> 01:06:30.945
I mean, I
don't, I wanna go.

01:06:32.947 --> 01:06:33.846
We have to go, we have to go.

01:06:33.848 --> 01:06:35.616
Let's go, let's go.

01:06:41.056 --> 01:06:44.390
- I told you he was a psycho.
- Is he following us?

01:06:44.392 --> 01:06:46.960
- Or was that just coincidence?
- God, I don't know, Jess.

01:06:46.962 --> 01:06:47.894
For Christ's sake,

01:06:47.896 --> 01:06:49.863
I'm too hungover for
this shit right now.

01:06:49.865 --> 01:06:50.797
Maybe you're just
being paranoid.

01:06:50.799 --> 01:06:51.665
I'm not being paranoid, okay?

01:06:51.667 --> 01:06:53.099
You saw the way he
was looking at us.

01:06:53.101 --> 01:06:54.634
Anyway, he's not
following us now.

01:06:54.636 --> 01:06:55.604
Just turn that off.

01:06:59.174 --> 01:07:00.576
Inside, Sophie.

01:07:07.649 --> 01:07:09.716
Oh, where the hell
have you two been?

01:07:09.718 --> 01:07:10.884
I am so hungry.

01:07:10.886 --> 01:07:12.487
Can we please get some food?

01:07:13.822 --> 01:07:16.023
What's going on with you two?

01:07:16.025 --> 01:07:17.858
We just went to get some food.

01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:19.093
We thought we'd let you sleep.

01:07:19.095 --> 01:07:20.527
Right.

01:07:20.529 --> 01:07:21.965
Why are you both
out of breath for?

01:07:24.499 --> 01:07:27.869
Well earlier, when we
were at the gas station,

01:07:27.871 --> 01:07:31.205
this guy was just standing
there, staring at Jess.

01:07:31.207 --> 01:07:34.208
And then when he spoke to me,
I didn't speak to him back.

01:07:34.210 --> 01:07:36.010
He just snapped at me.

01:07:36.012 --> 01:07:39.981
That same guy, he was just
in the diner we were in.

01:07:39.983 --> 01:07:41.949
I told her she's
just being paranoid.

01:07:41.951 --> 01:07:43.918
I'm not being
paranoid okay, Jess?

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:45.152
All right, babe, look.

01:07:45.154 --> 01:07:46.153
I'm sure it's nothing.

01:07:46.155 --> 01:07:47.157
Don't worry.

01:07:50.227 --> 01:07:52.060
Oh, and cheers by the way

01:07:52.062 --> 01:07:54.898
for trying to shit
me up earlier, Jess.

01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:57.065
What are you on about?

01:07:57.067 --> 01:07:58.666
You know, I've heard
your little ghost story.

01:07:58.668 --> 01:08:00.701
I'm not that gullible, girls.

01:08:00.703 --> 01:08:01.571
What is it?

01:08:04.808 --> 01:08:07.543
Jess trying to
shit me up with this.

01:08:10.114 --> 01:08:11.580
I didn't do that, Lis.

01:08:11.582 --> 01:08:14.485
You are such a
bad liar, Jess, I swear.

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:18.889
Look.

01:08:21.058 --> 01:08:22.624
What?

01:08:22.626 --> 01:08:24.528
That's the
note from the car.

01:08:25.962 --> 01:08:26.796
Shit.

01:08:28.066 --> 01:08:29.265
I forgot about that.

01:08:29.267 --> 01:08:30.666
Who the
fuck would follow us

01:08:30.667 --> 01:08:32.069
all the way here to do that?

01:08:34.872 --> 01:08:37.073
All right, I'm gonna
go to reception

01:08:37.075 --> 01:08:38.241
and just check who
else is staying here.

01:08:38.243 --> 01:08:40.176
Just, I'll be right back, okay?

01:08:40.178 --> 01:08:41.144
Soph?

01:08:41.145 --> 01:08:43.746
I didn't hear anything
like cars or anything.

01:08:43.747 --> 01:08:46.084
I'll be right back.

01:08:48.787 --> 01:08:49.953
Where did you find it?

01:08:49.955 --> 01:08:51.754
I literally just
woke up to use the lieu

01:08:51.756 --> 01:08:54.624
and it was just lying
down there on the mat.

01:08:54.626 --> 01:08:57.760
What, like someone
maybe dropped it by mistake?

01:08:57.761 --> 01:08:59.698
Doesn't look like a
mistake though, does it?

01:09:01.066 --> 01:09:01.997
And?

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.599
No, there's no one there.

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:05.969
Just this note that says
he's been called away

01:09:05.970 --> 01:09:06.935
on a family emergency.

01:09:06.938 --> 01:09:07.870
Another fucking note?

01:09:07.872 --> 01:09:08.707
Let me see.

01:09:09.874 --> 01:09:10.709
Fuck's sake.

01:09:13.078 --> 01:09:13.944
I don't know,
Sophie, maybe it's one

01:09:13.946 --> 01:09:15.813
of your crazy ass
fans or something.

01:09:15.814 --> 01:09:18.881
Yeah, but if it
is, it's a pretty sick joke.

01:09:18.884 --> 01:09:20.884
Yeah, exactly, let's
not freak out about this.

01:09:20.886 --> 01:09:22.152
Like, let's think
about it logically.

01:09:22.154 --> 01:09:24.220
Those YouTube prank videos,

01:09:24.223 --> 01:09:27.024
they're proper
popular at the moment.

01:09:27.026 --> 01:09:28.826
What about that guy that
changed our tire earlier?

01:09:28.828 --> 01:09:30.027
Like, he was weird.

01:09:30.029 --> 01:09:30.961
You've
gotta be kidding me.

01:09:30.962 --> 01:09:32.729
Now we've got another suspect.

01:09:32.732 --> 01:09:35.265
I don't know, it's just
we got another puncture.

01:09:35.268 --> 01:09:36.767
That shit happens twice,

01:09:36.769 --> 01:09:38.868
it's just too much
of a coincidence.

01:09:38.871 --> 01:09:40.270
Girls, at first,
honestly, I was scared.

01:09:40.273 --> 01:09:43.274
But now, like, come
on, this is ridiculous.

01:09:43.276 --> 01:09:45.210
It's gotta be a prank,
girls, it's just gotta be.

01:09:45.212 --> 01:09:47.711
Let's not freak out over
some stupid written notes like.

01:09:47.712 --> 01:09:50.247
We've had a fucked up day.

01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:51.082
We're all tired.

01:09:51.084 --> 01:09:52.716
Let's just get a
good night's sleep

01:09:52.718 --> 01:09:53.716
and we'll deal with
the puncture tomorrow

01:09:53.719 --> 01:09:55.320
before San Fran, yeah?

01:09:55.322 --> 01:09:57.155
Okay.

01:09:57.157 --> 01:09:58.291
- Lisa?
- Yeah?

01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:01.993
What the fuck is this?

01:10:01.995 --> 01:10:03.163
What?

01:10:05.699 --> 01:10:07.132
You bitch.

01:10:07.134 --> 01:10:08.702
Excuse me?

01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:11.770
You dirty fucking bitch.

01:10:11.772 --> 01:10:14.139
- What?
- What the hell, Jess?

01:10:14.141 --> 01:10:16.277
- Check my timeline.
- What is it?

01:10:18.979 --> 01:10:22.181
So, when were you gonna
tell me you fucked Ryan then?

01:10:22.183 --> 01:10:24.083
- What, I didn't?
- You didn't?

01:10:24.085 --> 01:10:26.651
You are so full of shit.

01:10:26.653 --> 01:10:28.187
- I didn't.
- Someone's posted a picture

01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:29.321
of you and Ryan in
bed together on...

01:10:29.323 --> 01:10:30.256
I didn't do it.

01:10:30.258 --> 01:10:32.091
Don't fucking lie to me, Lisa.

01:10:32.093 --> 01:10:34.226
- Fuck.
- Just tell her, Lis.

01:10:34.228 --> 01:10:35.227
How could you do that to me?

01:10:35.229 --> 01:10:36.629
You knew how much I loved him.

01:10:36.631 --> 01:10:37.863
I swear, you
need to believe me

01:10:37.865 --> 01:10:39.265
that it wasn't even
fucking like that.

01:10:39.267 --> 01:10:41.267
Look, I wanted to tell
you, but it just...

01:10:41.269 --> 01:10:42.837
- How many times then?
- What?

01:10:43.871 --> 01:10:45.237
Say what one more time,

01:10:45.239 --> 01:10:47.239
I swear, I'll rip your
fucking eyes out, Lisa.

01:10:47.241 --> 01:10:48.707
How many times?

01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:50.377
I swear to you, it
wasn't even like that.

01:10:50.379 --> 01:10:52.878
Like he was chatting shit to
me when we were in the club

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:54.147
and I know I shouldn't
have said anything

01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:55.915
- but it was just...
- No no no no no no.

01:10:55.917 --> 01:10:57.184
No no no.

01:10:57.186 --> 01:10:58.385
Of all the guys you
could have slept you,

01:10:58.387 --> 01:11:00.420
you chose to sleep with Ryan?

01:11:00.422 --> 01:11:02.721
What the fuck is
wrong with you, Lisa?

01:11:02.723 --> 01:11:05.660
I'm supposed to be
your best friend.

01:11:07.196 --> 01:11:08.263
I'm so sorry.

01:11:10.165 --> 01:11:11.898
I literally I don't even
know what to say to you.

01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:13.667
I just feel sick.

01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:14.303
You feel sick?

01:11:19.341 --> 01:11:21.944
Is that why you took
that pregnancy test?

01:11:23.346 --> 01:11:24.211
What you mean?

01:11:24.213 --> 01:11:25.112
Calm down, you're
not making any sense.

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:27.283
Don't tell me to
fucking calm down, Lisa.

01:11:34.023 --> 01:11:34.857
Soph.

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:41.829
You knew about this?

01:11:41.831 --> 01:11:43.333
Well, of
course I didn't.

01:11:45.768 --> 01:11:46.402
Sophie.

01:11:48.371 --> 01:11:49.372
Please tell me.

01:11:52.408 --> 01:11:54.277
Sophie, you're
just as bad as her.

01:11:56.447 --> 01:11:58.212
Someone has uploaded photos

01:11:58.214 --> 01:11:59.780
of your entire
conversation online.

01:11:59.782 --> 01:12:01.316
Don't fucking lie to me.

01:12:01.318 --> 01:12:02.417
Sophie, did you know?

01:12:02.419 --> 01:12:04.118
Jess, I'm sorry, I did.

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:05.086
I was in the middle of it.

01:12:05.088 --> 01:12:05.887
I didn't know what to do.

01:12:05.889 --> 01:12:07.324
I'm so sorry, I am.

01:12:08.958 --> 01:12:10.294
I actually trusted you.

01:12:13.364 --> 01:12:15.065
Turn that fucking camera off.

01:12:22.006 --> 01:12:24.006
I'm the fucking
worst, aren't I?

01:12:24.008 --> 01:12:25.276
Fucking asshole.

01:12:27.244 --> 01:12:29.745
Do you think she'll
ever forgive us?

01:12:29.747 --> 01:12:31.516
Honestly,
Lis, would you?

01:12:35.387 --> 01:12:36.187
I need sleep.

01:12:37.821 --> 01:12:38.787
I'm just gonna let
her calm down for a bit,

01:12:38.789 --> 01:12:40.055
go and see her later.

01:12:40.057 --> 01:12:42.394
Oh god, this is a nightmare.

01:12:50.302 --> 01:12:54.437
Sophie.

01:12:54.439 --> 01:12:55.440
- Soph.
- Yeah.

01:12:56.341 --> 01:12:58.276
Soph, wake up.

01:12:59.978 --> 01:13:02.145
I think I can hear
someone at the door.

01:13:02.147 --> 01:13:02.979
Is it Jess?

01:13:02.981 --> 01:13:04.514
I don't know.

01:13:04.516 --> 01:13:06.351
Well, go and check
in case it's Jess.

01:13:17.829 --> 01:13:20.797
I can't see shit,
it's just black outside.

01:13:20.799 --> 01:13:21.565
Just open the door.

01:13:21.567 --> 01:13:23.868
Just check it's not Jess.

01:13:46.593 --> 01:13:47.827
Anything?

01:13:50.863 --> 01:13:53.500
- What the fuck?
- What?

01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:58.938
Well, whose phone is that?

01:13:59.606 --> 01:14:00.840
It's mine.

01:14:02.242 --> 01:14:03.508
What?

01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:06.313
I fucking swear to
you this is my phone.

01:14:07.347 --> 01:14:09.416
- How?
- Oh my god.

01:14:11.251 --> 01:14:13.952
How has
your phone got there?

01:14:13.954 --> 01:14:15.455
Someone's been following us.

01:14:16.857 --> 01:14:21.862
Look.

01:14:23.196 --> 01:14:24.463
Photos of our trip.

01:14:24.465 --> 01:14:26.264
Look, when we were
in the Ferrari.

01:14:26.266 --> 01:14:29.067
He's been following
us this whole entire time.

01:14:29.069 --> 01:14:29.903
Oh my.

01:14:31.639 --> 01:14:32.906
What the fuck?

01:14:34.141 --> 01:14:36.007
There's a video.

01:14:36.009 --> 01:14:37.176
Shit, that's in the apartment.

01:14:37.178 --> 01:14:39.078
Sick.

01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:40.081
Oh my god.

01:14:43.151 --> 01:14:44.118
Fuck.

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:48.321
Literally right outside, right
outside our fucking door.

01:14:48.323 --> 01:14:51.023
How, how does
somebody know where we are?

01:14:51.025 --> 01:14:52.393
Oh my god.

01:14:53.494 --> 01:14:54.329
Sophie.

01:14:55.463 --> 01:14:57.198
- Sophie.
- He's inside.

01:15:00.168 --> 01:15:02.569
Oh my god.

01:15:02.571 --> 01:15:04.138
He's going to my room.

01:15:06.608 --> 01:15:08.207
He's going into my room.

01:15:08.209 --> 01:15:10.644
He got
into our apartment.

01:15:10.646 --> 01:15:12.847
He was in our apartment.

01:15:16.652 --> 01:15:17.486
Oh my god.

01:15:19.288 --> 01:15:21.056
- Oh my god.
- Fuck.

01:15:21.957 --> 01:15:23.292
Oh my god, shit.

01:15:28.297 --> 01:15:29.529
Fuck.

01:15:29.531 --> 01:15:30.464
That's
what those texts,

01:15:30.466 --> 01:15:31.598
that's what those numbers were.

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.367
What you mean?

01:15:33.369 --> 01:15:34.635
They're times.

01:15:34.637 --> 01:15:36.571
- On a timeline.
- The text messages.

01:15:36.573 --> 01:15:38.240
Look on
Jess's timeline.

01:15:40.109 --> 01:15:41.308
Look.

01:15:41.310 --> 01:15:42.577
It was when
she was checking us in.

01:15:42.579 --> 01:15:44.244
Yeah, it's
where she's posted.

01:15:44.246 --> 01:15:46.280
Every check-in,
look, the numbers.

01:15:46.282 --> 01:15:47.448
Are they the right numbers?

01:15:47.450 --> 01:15:49.051
They're the fucking
same numbers.

01:15:50.052 --> 01:15:51.352
I'm gonna
go and get Jess.

01:15:51.354 --> 01:15:53.054
Shit, the battery
has just died.

01:15:53.056 --> 01:15:54.657
We need to get the
fuck out of here.

01:15:56.659 --> 01:15:58.092
I can't believe
this is happening.

01:15:58.094 --> 01:15:59.961
I just wanna get
to San Fran now.

01:15:59.963 --> 01:16:03.099
This just literally
can't get any worse.

01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:10.974
Jess.

01:16:17.147 --> 01:16:18.181
Jess.

01:16:22.753 --> 01:16:23.587
Jess.

01:16:42.506 --> 01:16:43.340
Help.

01:16:44.542 --> 01:16:45.376
Help.

01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:47.144
Help.

01:16:48.647 --> 01:16:49.480
Help.

01:16:52.349 --> 01:16:53.483
Lisa.

01:16:53.485 --> 01:16:54.584
Lisa.

01:16:54.586 --> 01:16:56.151
Lisa.

01:16:56.153 --> 01:16:57.288
Lisa, help.

01:16:58.122 --> 01:16:59.656
What is happening?

01:16:59.658 --> 01:17:01.190
What?

01:17:01.192 --> 01:17:02.225
What the fuck?

01:17:02.227 --> 01:17:03.560
What's happened to Jess?

01:17:03.562 --> 01:17:06.262
What's happened to Jess?

01:17:06.264 --> 01:17:09.332
Babe, please, calm down,
I can't understand you.

01:17:09.334 --> 01:17:10.467
What?

01:17:10.469 --> 01:17:13.470
- He's here, he's here.
- Oh my god.

01:17:13.472 --> 01:17:14.304
Fuck.

01:17:14.306 --> 01:17:16.272
Fucking lock the door.

01:17:16.274 --> 01:17:18.441
Lock the fucking door.

01:17:18.443 --> 01:17:19.277
Fuck.

01:17:20.212 --> 01:17:21.679
Oh my fucking god.

01:17:21.681 --> 01:17:24.180
Fuck, fuck, okay.

01:17:24.182 --> 01:17:27.083
She's really
gone, he's outside.

01:17:27.085 --> 01:17:29.052
Sh, you need to calm down.

01:17:29.054 --> 01:17:30.454
You need to just be
quiet for a minute.

01:17:30.456 --> 01:17:31.689
Be quiet for a minute.

01:17:31.691 --> 01:17:33.357
We need
to get in the car.

01:17:33.359 --> 01:17:34.224
No, we can't, we can't.

01:17:34.226 --> 01:17:35.258
There's a fucking
puncture in the car.

01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:36.760
We're not gonna get far.

01:17:36.762 --> 01:17:38.262
- He's probably fucking...
- What's happened to Jess.

01:17:38.264 --> 01:17:39.497
We really have to go.

01:17:39.499 --> 01:17:42.399
He's probably down
there waiting for us.

01:17:42.401 --> 01:17:43.567
It's all my fault.

01:17:43.569 --> 01:17:44.735
We need to barricade
the door, babe.

01:17:44.737 --> 01:17:46.572
Help me, put the
camera down, help me.

01:17:52.345 --> 01:17:53.746
Sh, it's okay.

01:17:54.714 --> 01:17:55.548
Fucking...

01:17:58.317 --> 01:17:59.450
The fuck.

01:17:59.452 --> 01:18:00.417
Go to the kitchen.

01:18:00.419 --> 01:18:01.820
Just grab fucking anything.

01:18:01.822 --> 01:18:03.521
I'll fucking stab
him if I see him,

01:18:03.523 --> 01:18:05.256
I swear to fucking god.

01:18:05.258 --> 01:18:06.392
Fucking.

01:18:07.226 --> 01:18:08.325
It's gonna be okay.

01:18:08.327 --> 01:18:09.228
Just breathe.

01:18:11.632 --> 01:18:12.797
It's okay, babe.

01:18:12.799 --> 01:18:14.533
I need you to just stay strong.

01:18:14.535 --> 01:18:16.301
I can't do this
without you, Sophie.

01:18:16.303 --> 01:18:18.837
Please, please, just
try and calm down.

01:18:18.839 --> 01:18:19.771
We're gonna
die in here, Lisa.

01:18:19.773 --> 01:18:21.275
No, no, we're fucking not.

01:18:22.276 --> 01:18:23.441
Don't stop filming.

01:18:23.443 --> 01:18:26.745
Whatever you do,
fucking keep filming.

01:18:26.747 --> 01:18:29.114
The camera is our fucking
lifeline right now.

01:18:29.116 --> 01:18:31.116
No matter what the
fuck happens to us,

01:18:31.118 --> 01:18:33.351
that footage can
fucking save us.

01:18:33.353 --> 01:18:34.553
How much battery
have you got left?

01:18:34.555 --> 01:18:35.453
Not much.

01:18:36.356 --> 01:18:37.391
Fuck.

01:18:41.228 --> 01:18:41.861
Fuck.

01:18:41.863 --> 01:18:43.698
You fucking sick fuck.

01:18:51.806 --> 01:18:53.508
I think he's gone.

01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:57.211
I think he's gone.

01:18:59.747 --> 01:19:02.582
Fuck, fuck, get fucking
down, he's outside.

01:19:02.584 --> 01:19:03.418
The fuck.

01:19:05.386 --> 01:19:07.722
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:19:13.328 --> 01:19:14.162
Fuck.

01:19:15.296 --> 01:19:16.130
Oh my god.

01:19:27.476 --> 01:19:29.876
Fuck, fuck, I just
fucking saw him.

01:19:29.878 --> 01:19:31.411
He's fucking outside.

01:19:31.413 --> 01:19:32.913
He's fucking outside.

01:19:32.915 --> 01:19:34.448
Oh my fucking god.

01:19:39.922 --> 01:19:41.188
Sh.

01:19:41.190 --> 01:19:41.891
Sh, Sophie.

01:19:45.194 --> 01:19:46.528
Just keep quiet.

01:19:48.765 --> 01:19:50.432
Sophie, listen to me.

01:19:51.701 --> 01:19:54.535
Listen to me, we are gonna
die if we stay here, okay?

01:19:54.537 --> 01:19:56.539
We need to get out
of this fucking room.

01:19:57.941 --> 01:20:01.878
Turn the music
on, turn the music on.

01:20:08.351 --> 01:20:09.819
We gotta run, Lisa, okay?

01:20:12.789 --> 01:20:13.621
Are you ready?

01:20:13.623 --> 01:20:14.689
We need to run.

01:20:14.691 --> 01:20:17.394
Sophie, we need to make a run.

01:20:18.528 --> 01:20:19.661
Are you ready?

01:20:19.663 --> 01:20:20.495
Go.

01:20:20.497 --> 01:20:21.331
Just run!

01:20:23.299 --> 01:20:24.769
Okay, okay.

01:20:27.404 --> 01:20:29.239
Just get into the car.

01:20:34.344 --> 01:20:36.578
It won't turn on.

01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:38.514
He's fucked with the car.

01:20:38.516 --> 01:20:40.482
He's fucked with
the fucking car.

01:20:40.484 --> 01:20:42.420
It won't fucking start.

01:20:43.254 --> 01:20:44.553
It won't fucking start.

01:20:44.555 --> 01:20:47.456
It won't start, it
won't fucking start.

01:21:43.649 --> 01:21:45.583
I love you, Mom and Dad.

01:21:45.585 --> 01:21:47.687
I love you so fucking much.

01:21:49.055 --> 01:21:52.525
Oh god, I'm so sorry
if I ever hurt you.

01:21:54.494 --> 01:21:57.430
Oh god, I hope you never
have to see this video.

01:22:03.069 --> 01:22:07.975
I don't wanna die.

01:22:08.775 --> 01:22:09.642
Oh please.

01:22:15.849 --> 01:22:20.854
And, Matthew, baby, I
love you, so, so, so much.

01:22:24.057 --> 01:22:27.092
Thank you for being the
most amazing boyfriend

01:22:27.094 --> 01:22:28.827
I could ever wish for.

01:22:28.829 --> 01:22:29.663
Thank you.

01:22:31.598 --> 01:22:33.600
The way you hug me
to sleep every night.

01:22:36.603 --> 01:22:38.438
God, just being there.

01:22:47.015 --> 01:22:49.716
There is one more thing, baby.

01:22:53.755 --> 01:22:55.822
I'm pregnant.

01:22:55.824 --> 01:22:56.791
I am so sorry.

01:22:58.660 --> 01:22:59.859
I wanted to tell you when I got

01:22:59.861 --> 01:23:01.830
back to the UK but I'm sorry.

01:23:12.707 --> 01:23:14.008
I'm ready for you.

01:23:15.476 --> 01:23:17.810
I'm ready for you, you
sick fucking bastard.

01:23:17.812 --> 01:23:18.978
Come on.

01:23:18.980 --> 01:23:19.814
Come on.

01:28:02.472 --> 01:28:03.639
Help!

01:28:05.375 --> 01:28:06.208
Help!
