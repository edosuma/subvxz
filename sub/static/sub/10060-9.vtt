WEBVTT

00:17.041 --> 00:18.417
FRAN:
Talk to me like an adult!

00:18.417 --> 00:21.083
I don't wanna talk, ok?
I don't belong with you.

00:21.083 --> 00:22.041
Please go.

00:22.250 --> 00:23.708
CHARLIE:
Why aren't you in Japan?

00:23.708 --> 00:25.792
There aren't exactly
like a wealth of options

00:25.792 --> 00:27.583
for an NYU graduate
with experience

00:27.583 --> 00:28.792
in brand management.

00:29.250 --> 00:30.750
I left Desi.

00:31.375 --> 00:32.250
Really?

00:32.583 --> 00:34.166
This is the realest
thing I've ever done.

00:34.166 --> 00:35.625
ELIJAH:
I just wanna be clear

00:35.625 --> 00:37.125
about what our situation is.

00:37.125 --> 00:38.792
(SIGHS)
What situation?

00:38.792 --> 00:41.667
It's easier for Desi
to separate the music

00:41.667 --> 00:42.792
and his personal life.

00:42.792 --> 00:44.041
So, I think
I understand now.

00:44.041 --> 00:45.750
When we're singing,
he can talk to me

00:45.750 --> 00:46.917
and tell me
what I'm doing wrong,

00:46.917 --> 00:49.291
but the minute we stop
I cease to exist.

00:49.625 --> 00:51.667
Are you, uh, with Adam?

00:52.500 --> 00:53.500
Yeah.

01:02.208 --> 01:03.583
Don't you get it, Hannah?

01:03.583 --> 01:05.166
I am not a person
who yells, okay?

01:05.166 --> 01:06.834
I am not a person
who freaks out.

01:06.834 --> 01:09.041
I'm a chill
fucking person,

01:09.041 --> 01:12.000
and you made me
go fucking insane.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.583
I'm really sorry.

01:13.583 --> 01:15.291
You're fuckin' sorry?

01:15.291 --> 01:17.959
I've never acted
like this before in
a relationship, all right?

01:17.959 --> 01:19.250
Not once.

01:19.250 --> 01:20.583
I'm a good
fuckin' boyfriend.

01:20.583 --> 01:22.625
And you, you just
shit all over that.

01:22.625 --> 01:26.083
You shit all over it,
and you somehow make me
the fuckin' bad guy?

01:26.083 --> 01:27.917
Fran, stop, okay?

01:27.917 --> 01:32.458
You're a dick.
A secret dick, to be sure,
but you are a dick.

01:32.458 --> 01:35.458
You're very judgmental.
You're very moralistic.

01:35.458 --> 01:38.125
You definitely would've
sent witches to trial
in "The Crucible."

01:38.125 --> 01:41.500
And that might
work for some, like,
administrative assistant

01:41.500 --> 01:43.083
that you meet
in a sports bar,

01:43.083 --> 01:44.834
but it doesn't
work for me.

01:44.834 --> 01:48.208
Our relationship
didn't work out.
It sucks.

01:48.208 --> 01:49.708
At this point,
it really doesn't matter

01:49.708 --> 01:51.667
who the asshole was
or who the asshole wasn't,

01:51.667 --> 01:53.792
so why can't you just
take your stuff and go?

01:53.792 --> 01:55.875
You wouldn't know
real love

01:55.875 --> 01:57.500
if it bit
your fuckin' tit off.

01:57.500 --> 01:59.000
I'm sure you're right.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.625
You said to me,
point-blank,

02:00.625 --> 02:02.583
that you had never
been in a healthy
relationship before.

02:02.583 --> 02:04.542
So how would you even know
if this was healthy?

02:04.542 --> 02:05.750
I wouldn't know.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.333
Maybe, for all you know,
you just said good-bye

02:07.333 --> 02:08.917
to the best thing that
ever happened to you.

02:08.917 --> 02:10.583
Probably, I did.

02:10.583 --> 02:12.500
You're gonna regret this
so fuckin' hard.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.917
Fran, I don't know why
you can't just give this up.

02:14.917 --> 02:16.625
You don't even like me.

02:16.625 --> 02:20.542
It does not matter
if I don't like you, okay?

02:20.542 --> 02:22.875
I love you.

02:22.875 --> 02:24.792
I would be happy
to pay for an Uber

02:24.792 --> 02:28.000
to transport
you and your things
back to your home.

02:29.542 --> 02:32.667
( music playing )

02:45.041 --> 02:47.208
( moaning softly )

03:00.917 --> 03:02.917
- ( gasps )
- ( jackhammer rattling )

03:02.917 --> 03:04.875
( distant men shouting )

03:06.333 --> 03:08.083
Oh, fuck.

03:08.083 --> 03:09.750
( car horn honking )

03:09.750 --> 03:11.458
So, what, you had
a sex dream about Ray?

03:11.458 --> 03:14.000
You've had
actual sex with Ray,
which is way worse.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.333
And I've had sex dreams
about everybody I've known,
including you.

03:17.333 --> 03:18.834
You raped me.

03:18.834 --> 03:22.250
No, it wasn't a sex dream,
it wasn't a love dream.

03:22.250 --> 03:23.750
We weren't even
having sex in it.

03:23.750 --> 03:26.291
I mean, I still came,
but it was from something else.

03:26.291 --> 03:27.917
Oh, Marnie, I don't
want to hear about this.

03:27.917 --> 03:29.291
And you can't come.

03:29.291 --> 03:31.083
I was brushing his hair.

03:31.083 --> 03:33.458
Well, that's
a fool's errand
if I ever heard one.

03:33.458 --> 03:36.417
He had this long,
gorgeous hair.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.375
It was like Khaleesi
from "Game of Thrones"

03:38.375 --> 03:40.667
except it was
raven black,

03:40.667 --> 03:44.041
and I was just brushing it
slowly and tenderly

03:44.041 --> 03:46.917
and I was getting him
ready for school.

03:46.917 --> 03:49.959
So, he was, like,
your daughter?

03:49.959 --> 03:51.917
Yeah, in a sense.

03:51.917 --> 03:53.667
God, I just can't
get it out of my mind.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.291
It's like the best thing
that's happened to me
in months.

03:56.291 --> 03:59.083
That's the most
depressing thing I've
heard in my entire life.

03:59.083 --> 04:03.208
And you know what?
I wish it was real.

04:03.208 --> 04:06.083
What is wrong with me?

04:06.083 --> 04:09.667
Well, your sandals,
for starters.

04:09.667 --> 04:11.500
( singing along )
♪ Ain't no love ♪

04:11.500 --> 04:15.625
♪ And it's sure
'nuff a pity ♪

04:15.625 --> 04:17.291
♪ Ain't no love ♪

04:17.291 --> 04:19.834
♪ 'Cause you
ain't around... ♪

04:19.834 --> 04:21.916
- Shosh?
- Ray.

04:21.916 --> 04:23.542
Shosh, is that
really you?

04:23.542 --> 04:26.875
- Oh, my God.
Oh, Shosh.
- Hey.

04:26.875 --> 04:29.667
Mm, Shosh,
look at you.

04:29.667 --> 04:31.166
I can't believe
it's you.

04:31.166 --> 04:33.291
You're a full-grown
woman now.

04:33.291 --> 04:34.417
( laughs )

04:34.417 --> 04:36.041
Are you guys closed?

04:36.041 --> 04:38.291
No, but I'm about
to shut it down
for the day.

04:38.291 --> 04:40.166
I've got a community board
meeting in a little while

04:40.166 --> 04:42.125
and then there's
a Dennis Kucinich
live webstream

04:42.125 --> 04:43.208
I want to hop onto.

04:43.208 --> 04:45.333
What the fuck
happened in here?

04:45.333 --> 04:46.959
Yeah, that.

04:46.959 --> 04:48.875
Across the street
over there.

04:48.875 --> 04:52.250
We've been outpaced,
outshined, outmaneuvered,
out everything

04:52.250 --> 04:56.500
by those neo-hippie
gender-neutral monsters.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.583
It's very bleak, Shosh.
It's very bleak.

04:58.583 --> 05:00.667
Hermie says that if business
doesn't pick up in here,

05:00.667 --> 05:02.417
he's gonna turn this place
into a billiards store.

05:02.417 --> 05:04.875
- Not bar, store.
- Okay, you have to
fight this, Ray.

05:04.875 --> 05:06.875
You have to have
a wartime attitude.

05:06.875 --> 05:09.750
Maybe ask for some help,
something I know you're
fucking terrible at,

05:09.750 --> 05:11.041
but ask for it anyways.

05:11.041 --> 05:12.291
Who's gonna
help me, Shosh?

05:12.291 --> 05:14.667
Who? My last remaining
employee's Elijah.

05:14.667 --> 05:16.625
Hermie's consuming heroic
amounts of painkillers.

05:16.625 --> 05:18.125
My coffee truck
is a complete bust

05:18.125 --> 05:19.542
for reasons I can't
even get into,

05:19.542 --> 05:21.583
although they involve
Hannah trying to suckle

05:21.583 --> 05:23.667
the head of my penis
at 50 miles an hour.

05:23.667 --> 05:26.667
Okay, I'm gonna help you.
Seriously, what do you think
I was doing in Japan?

05:26.667 --> 05:29.792
I mean, other than learning
origami and eating candy that
tastes like other candy.

05:29.792 --> 05:32.792
I do marketing, Ray.
It is my area of expertise.

05:32.792 --> 05:34.333
I went to mother effing
college for it,

05:34.333 --> 05:36.250
so, you know, at least
let me have a crack at that.

05:36.250 --> 05:38.708
We do make
a pretty good team.

05:38.708 --> 05:40.125
The best.

05:41.625 --> 05:43.625
Wait, Hannah?

05:43.625 --> 05:44.792
Y-yeah.

05:44.792 --> 05:45.917
Don't tell me.

05:45.917 --> 05:48.750
( music playing
over speakers )

05:48.750 --> 05:50.291
Can I help you
with anything?

05:50.291 --> 05:52.875
( sighs )
I don't fuckin' know.

05:52.875 --> 05:57.625
Um, I guess I'm looking
for items that say...

05:57.625 --> 05:59.875
"I really am
the one for you,

05:59.875 --> 06:01.792
despite your misgivings
about monogamy

06:01.792 --> 06:04.041
and your penthouse
full of whores."

06:04.041 --> 06:05.750
( laughs )

06:05.750 --> 06:08.708
I've been in a very open
relationship...

06:08.708 --> 06:11.417
( whispering )
with a very well-known
television personality.

06:11.417 --> 06:15.917
- Okay.
- And I am
really hoping to...

06:15.917 --> 06:17.417
close it.

06:17.417 --> 06:18.708
Say no more.

06:18.708 --> 06:20.333
Mm-hmm.

06:23.333 --> 06:24.834
Ah.

06:27.333 --> 06:30.417
This is really
speaking to me for that.

06:30.417 --> 06:32.625
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

06:32.625 --> 06:34.208
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

06:34.208 --> 06:36.000
All right.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.583
Why aren't you working
in a more high-end retail
establishment?

06:38.583 --> 06:40.792
Now, why aren't you
shopping in one?

06:40.792 --> 06:43.291
Ooh, touché.

06:43.291 --> 06:45.291
- Uh...
- D'Emilia.

06:45.291 --> 06:47.792
D'Emilia.
Hmm.

06:47.792 --> 06:49.834
Well, let's "Pretty Woman"
this shit, D'Emilia.

06:49.834 --> 06:51.458
- You got it.
- ( clicks tongue )

07:10.834 --> 07:13.333
Principal Toby:
Wow, good thing
school's not in session

07:13.333 --> 07:16.000
or that outfit
would definitely not fly.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.166
Oh, you know, I'm kinda
trying to spend less time

07:19.166 --> 07:21.500
in places where
my outfit doesn't fly.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.542
You know,
my proverbial outfit.

07:23.542 --> 07:26.667
Um, I'm not sure
I follow.

07:26.667 --> 07:28.083
Principal Toby,

07:28.083 --> 07:32.041
this has been
a really, really amazing
opportunity for me.

07:32.041 --> 07:35.041
You've taken a lot of chances
on me, and I'm sure you've
taken a lot of flak,

07:35.041 --> 07:36.834
which is why I'm gonna
seem like a real wench

07:36.834 --> 07:39.291
when I say that I don't think
I'll be coming back next year.

07:39.291 --> 07:42.333
Oh, gosh, I-- why?

07:42.333 --> 07:44.583
Did you get-- did you
get another job?

07:44.583 --> 07:46.792
Is it those bastards
from Fort Greene Montessori?

07:46.792 --> 07:48.875
No, what it is is that
I've been trying

07:48.875 --> 07:51.000
to stay more open
to signals from the universe,

07:51.000 --> 07:53.041
and I don't know if I can be
open to those signals

07:53.041 --> 07:56.041
if I'm tuned in
to another song.

07:56.041 --> 07:57.625
This job being the song.

07:57.625 --> 08:00.625
Okay, Hannah.
I wish you all the best.

08:00.625 --> 08:05.208
I really do.
You know, you've been
so... eye-opening to me.

08:05.208 --> 08:07.542
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

08:07.542 --> 08:10.208
I mean, with all your
setbacks and your issues,

08:10.208 --> 08:13.458
you live your life
with such joie de vivre.

08:13.458 --> 08:16.083
You're right, I do.
I do have a lot of
joie de vivre.

08:16.083 --> 08:17.500
You do.
You really do,

08:17.500 --> 08:20.000
and it's unusual
to see that in a teacher.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.458
I mean, it's unusual
to see it in anybody.

08:22.458 --> 08:24.583
I really hope you find
what you're looking for.

08:24.583 --> 08:26.000
Thank you,
Principal Toby.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.375
And for the record,
I think you're a lot funkier

08:28.375 --> 08:30.041
than people
give you credit for.

08:32.707 --> 08:36.125
And, by the way,
I'm really sorry
I showed you my pussy.

08:36.125 --> 08:37.582
I was in
a bad relationship

08:37.582 --> 08:39.375
and I was blasting
a lot of energy

08:39.375 --> 08:40.875
in the wrong
direction.

08:40.875 --> 08:44.041
Forget about it.
Water under the bridge.

08:44.041 --> 08:46.083
Thank you, sir.

08:52.834 --> 08:54.208
( sighs )

08:57.834 --> 08:59.000
Hannah!

08:59.000 --> 09:01.708
( rings bell )
Hannah. Hannah Horvath.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.625
Tally, hey.

09:03.625 --> 09:07.166
Oh, my God.
( chuckles )

09:07.166 --> 09:09.083
This is so crazy.

09:09.083 --> 09:12.291
I was literally
just thinking about you.

09:12.291 --> 09:13.458
Um, why?

09:13.458 --> 09:16.125
I am writing a novel
about the tyranny

09:16.125 --> 09:18.000
of political correctness
at Oberlin,

09:18.000 --> 09:19.959
so of course I'm including
the sophomore year incident

09:19.959 --> 09:22.667
where you called our R.A.
a Jewish Hitler and then
heil'd him.

09:22.667 --> 09:25.417
Yeah, well, you know,
that's sort of my story
to tell.

09:25.417 --> 09:28.375
You do remember it, yeah.
How are you?

09:28.375 --> 09:32.125
Um, I'm okay.
It's a work in progress,

09:32.125 --> 09:34.458
as it is for everybody,
I would say.

09:34.458 --> 09:35.458
People big and small.

09:35.458 --> 09:37.500
Mm-hmm,
I do know that, girl.

09:37.500 --> 09:40.041
I just got back
from a writing retreat
at MacDowell,

09:40.041 --> 09:42.458
so you're, like,
the sixth person I've seen
since I left my cabin.

09:42.458 --> 09:44.542
So, I'm just like,
I feel so crazy!

09:44.542 --> 09:47.166
Like, I just want to, like,
murder someone in the face!

09:47.166 --> 09:49.000
Where are you headed?
Do you want to hang out?

09:49.000 --> 09:53.542
Um, I'm not really headed
anywhere in particular
at the moment.

09:53.542 --> 09:54.917
Okay.

09:54.917 --> 09:56.250
Well, that's perfect

09:56.250 --> 09:58.458
'cause I'm literally free
until 3:00 AM.

09:58.458 --> 10:00.000
And I guess I'm free
till I have to go home

10:00.000 --> 10:01.458
to Michigan
for Thanksgiving.

10:01.458 --> 10:03.667
- So, let's do it.
- Let's catch up.

10:03.667 --> 10:05.458
- Yeah.
- Okay.

10:05.458 --> 10:07.500
Wow, this is crazy.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.166
You look
exactly the same.

10:09.166 --> 10:11.500
- Thanks, your bike looks
really expensive.
- Yeah.

10:11.500 --> 10:15.500
Well, thank you
for agreeing to meet
like this.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.000
It's very big of you,

10:17.000 --> 10:20.708
especially
considering Tandace.

10:20.708 --> 10:24.000
Thank you for saying that.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.708
That means a lot to me,
praise coming from you.

10:26.708 --> 10:27.917
Okay, don't go overboard.

10:27.917 --> 10:29.708
I just think that
if we're going to keep

10:29.708 --> 10:31.708
the ball rolling
post-"Grey's"...

10:31.708 --> 10:32.708
Mm-hmm.

10:32.708 --> 10:34.875
...we have to put
the past behind us.

10:34.875 --> 10:36.250
I agree.

10:36.250 --> 10:38.667
- This is a big moment
for both of us.
- I know.

10:38.667 --> 10:40.875
I just need you
to please promise me

10:40.875 --> 10:43.166
that the not-talking-to-me
bullshit is over.

10:43.166 --> 10:46.000
- Okay, well,
it's tricky, Marn...
- No.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.542
...when the aggression train
is headed straight towards me.

10:47.542 --> 10:49.542
- We're collaborators.
- Okay.

10:49.542 --> 10:51.542
- I understand we're
collaborating...
- It's childish.

10:51.542 --> 10:53.291
...so don't judge the way
that my process works.

10:53.291 --> 10:54.542
- Baby.
- Well, I'm not--

10:54.542 --> 10:56.667
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

10:56.667 --> 10:59.125
- It's time to go.
- Okay, my e ku'u.

10:59.125 --> 11:02.291
Actually, there's
a couple more bullet points
we're supposed to go over.

11:02.291 --> 11:04.375
- Des, you said
eight minutes.
- Yeah.

11:04.375 --> 11:05.708
Any more than that
will be...

11:05.708 --> 11:08.500
Re-immersion, right.

11:08.500 --> 11:09.917
We're done talking.

11:11.083 --> 11:12.417
Yes.

11:12.417 --> 11:15.375
- I got you that tea.
- Oh, thank you.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.542
How does that
make you feel?

11:17.542 --> 11:21.000
You know, grateful
and excited.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.458
Thirsty.

11:25.208 --> 11:29.041
Okay, Marn, I will
catch you at rehearsal.

11:31.250 --> 11:34.417
- I got you the hemp...
- I love that stuff.

11:34.417 --> 11:36.500
Hey, what are you
drinking?

11:36.500 --> 11:38.875
( conversation continues
indistinctly )

11:38.875 --> 11:41.708
- ( sighs )
- ( Desi laughs )

11:41.708 --> 11:43.959
We're gonna move
the end above here.
And then just--

11:43.959 --> 11:46.083
- Woman: You're gonna
cross out the--
- Yeah, exactly.

11:46.083 --> 11:47.458
Hi.

11:47.458 --> 11:49.458
Elijah, hey.
What a surprise.

11:49.458 --> 11:52.125
Uh, can I talk to you
for-- about something?

11:52.125 --> 11:54.125
Well, if it's about
the troop situation
in Kandahar,

11:54.125 --> 11:55.875
then Alexia's already
beat you to the punch.

11:55.875 --> 11:58.834
- ( laughs )
- Wait in the wings,
we'll get a drink afterwards.

11:58.834 --> 12:00.667
- Alexia, can you show him
where to stand?
- Sure.

12:00.667 --> 12:03.458
Um, no, actually,
can we talk now?

12:05.250 --> 12:07.917
- Get that
in the teleprompter?
- Yes.

12:10.458 --> 12:13.125
All right,
is this another one
of your states of the union?

12:13.125 --> 12:14.959
No, it's not.

12:14.959 --> 12:18.333
I'm not happy
with the way
we left things.

12:18.333 --> 12:23.417
I was angry and I felt
like you were...
embarrassed,

12:23.417 --> 12:26.291
even though that's not
an emotion you claim
to be able to feel.

12:26.291 --> 12:29.583
Well, I'm gonna be embarrassed
if I miss this broadcast.

12:29.583 --> 12:32.291
What is it?

12:32.291 --> 12:35.834
Dill, I know you would
never admit this to yourself,

12:35.834 --> 12:40.417
but don't you want
to be with somebody
who sees you for you?

12:40.417 --> 12:44.041
- Beyond all of this?
- Elijah.

12:44.041 --> 12:47.792
I'm the only person
who's gonna be honest
with you

12:47.792 --> 12:51.834
about your bad jokes
and the fact that,

12:51.834 --> 12:53.875
no, you don't look better
with a shaved head.

12:53.875 --> 12:56.041
And if you say
your private life
is private

12:56.041 --> 12:58.667
and then you go
and see Cher in Las Vegas,

12:58.667 --> 13:00.417
that's not the same thing
as coming out of the closet.

13:00.417 --> 13:04.708
But all those guys
you have around,
all those...

13:04.708 --> 13:07.083
fucking guys
you just have,

13:07.083 --> 13:09.500
they're only gonna tell you
what you want to hear

13:09.500 --> 13:10.917
and they're gonna
cater to you

13:10.917 --> 13:14.250
because of your fame
and the stuff that you have.

13:16.375 --> 13:18.375
I don't want your stuff.

13:21.125 --> 13:24.792
You're gonna end up
with nothing.

13:24.792 --> 13:27.250
And you deserve
everything.

13:30.917 --> 13:35.291
Dill, don't you want
to be with someone

13:35.291 --> 13:37.417
who sees you for you?

13:38.875 --> 13:45.041
Don't you want a--
a boyfriend someone?

13:45.041 --> 13:47.041
Who's honest?

13:48.375 --> 13:51.291
- Wow.
- ( Elijah chuckles )

13:51.291 --> 13:53.875
- Hold on, hold on.
- I--

13:55.583 --> 13:58.083
You're not wrong.

13:58.083 --> 14:03.083
I've wanted something
serious for a while and...

14:03.083 --> 14:04.792
maybe this is the time.

14:04.792 --> 14:07.250
- That's what I'm saying.
- That's not what I mean.

14:07.250 --> 14:10.458
I'm looking
for someone special.

14:11.375 --> 14:13.500
A special someone.

14:13.500 --> 14:15.083
For me.

14:18.375 --> 14:20.083
And I'm not that someone.

14:21.917 --> 14:26.250
What can I say, Elijah?
Love is so mysterious.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.208
- What does he look like?
- Elijah, please.

14:29.208 --> 14:31.125
No, I'm-- I'm just curious.
I'm really curious.

14:31.125 --> 14:32.625
What does this person
even look like?

14:32.625 --> 14:34.708
I don't know, someone
closer to my own age...

14:34.708 --> 14:36.333
- Well...
- ...tall...

14:36.333 --> 14:37.708
Tall? We're like
the same height.

14:37.708 --> 14:40.166
How much taller
could a person be?

14:43.083 --> 14:45.417
Someone less aimless.

14:47.375 --> 14:49.083
Thank you.

14:50.375 --> 14:52.667
I feel so supported.

14:54.917 --> 14:58.250
God, you've opened up
my mind...

14:58.250 --> 15:00.000
and my heart.

15:01.375 --> 15:03.959
I'll think of you
every time I go to Brooklyn.

15:08.417 --> 15:11.083
( chatter )

15:21.708 --> 15:24.000
( laughing, chattering )

15:34.166 --> 15:35.667
Can I help you?

15:35.667 --> 15:37.667
Oh, yeah, hey.

15:37.667 --> 15:41.792
I'm writing a poem...

15:41.792 --> 15:44.166
out of found words,

15:44.166 --> 15:47.166
so I'm, just, like,
looking for some words, man.

15:47.166 --> 15:48.333
That's cool.

15:48.333 --> 15:49.750
Do you mind if we
give you a few words?

15:49.750 --> 15:52.125
Yeah, for sure.
There are no rules.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.041
There are rules.

15:54.041 --> 15:54.917
"Greenery."

15:54.917 --> 15:56.333
Great.

15:56.333 --> 15:57.750
Barista:
"Silenced."

15:57.750 --> 15:58.834
Beautiful.

15:58.834 --> 16:00.708
- "Champion."
- "Ally."

16:00.708 --> 16:02.750
- "Tunic."
- Loving them.

16:02.750 --> 16:04.708
"Cat."

16:04.708 --> 16:07.375
I don't know
if I'm gonna beat that.
That's really powerful.

16:07.375 --> 16:10.208
Yeah, I haven't
really, like, perfected
the rhyme scheme yet,

16:10.208 --> 16:12.625
so these are
actually perfect.

16:12.625 --> 16:14.083
Thank you.

16:14.083 --> 16:16.875
Um, mahalo.

16:18.875 --> 16:22.417
I dated this guy
on and off for a while.
Like, two years.

16:22.417 --> 16:24.792
- I mean, it was pretty
serious, I guess.
- Mm-hmm.

16:24.792 --> 16:28.542
But we broke up because
I went to the Iowa
Writers' Workshop,

16:28.542 --> 16:30.250
which also
didn't work out--

16:30.250 --> 16:32.834
Yeah, of course.
I mean, did you not
just feel so oppressed

16:32.834 --> 16:34.291
while you were there?

16:34.291 --> 16:36.708
Or was it that,
like, annoying emphasis
on traditional fiction

16:36.708 --> 16:38.041
that just kind of, like...

16:38.041 --> 16:39.542
I just didn't
want to write.

16:39.542 --> 16:41.542
Yeah, welcome to the club.

16:41.542 --> 16:45.583
No, I mean, like,
I don't write anymore.

16:45.583 --> 16:47.250
I don't even write
to-do lists.

16:47.250 --> 16:49.000
I just don't do it.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.667
Really?

16:50.667 --> 16:54.959
Just, like, total
identity switcheroo.

16:54.959 --> 16:56.500
I think that's very brave.

16:56.500 --> 16:58.375
I think that's
very beautiful and brave.

16:58.375 --> 17:03.083
You know, then I got back
and he was dating this girl--
woman, Mimi-Rose.

17:03.083 --> 17:04.250
Howard?

17:04.250 --> 17:05.500
You know her?

17:05.500 --> 17:08.083
Mm-hmm.
She is such garbage,

17:08.083 --> 17:11.666
and if she fucks with me
at one more TEDxWomen's event,

17:11.666 --> 17:14.583
I'm going to kill her
and then I will rejoice.

17:14.583 --> 17:17.959
Her fucking lectures,
she's just like, "Hi,
I've got a lot to say

17:17.959 --> 17:21.375
about the feminist approach
to fucking being a bitch."

17:21.375 --> 17:22.583
Oh, oh, for sure.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.458
She is like a pure
white blinding evil.

17:25.458 --> 17:27.666
And then I dated this teacher
who was, like, you know,

17:27.666 --> 17:29.083
fine, but he was a square.

17:29.083 --> 17:31.583
- I'm not,
obviously, a square.
- Mm-mm.

17:31.583 --> 17:33.667
Plus, I was just using him
to try to get over Adam,

17:33.667 --> 17:35.917
who's probably the only
person I've ever loved,
so there's that.

17:35.917 --> 17:38.792
So, why not just
go after that?

17:38.792 --> 17:40.458
Oh, I can't.

17:40.458 --> 17:42.750
I couldn't even
if I wanted to.

17:42.750 --> 17:44.291
You remember
Jessa, right?

17:44.291 --> 17:46.625
Of course.
She tried to cook meth
in South Hall

17:46.625 --> 17:49.333
and then all
the HazMat people came
and we were all so excited.

17:49.333 --> 17:51.208
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
In fairness to her,

17:51.208 --> 17:52.458
she was cooking
the meth to sell.

17:52.458 --> 17:54.417
What she was smoking
was crack.

17:54.417 --> 17:57.417
- Well, that's good.
- But anyway, he's
with her now.

17:58.667 --> 18:00.291
Really?

18:00.291 --> 18:02.708
And is that
normal for you?

18:02.708 --> 18:05.208
I mean, aren't you guys,
like, best friends?

18:05.208 --> 18:06.625
Thought so.

18:06.625 --> 18:08.291
Oh, fuck.

18:08.291 --> 18:12.417
That's so intense.
I'm so sorry.

18:12.417 --> 18:13.792
( sighs )

18:13.792 --> 18:16.458
Yeah, from what I remember,
she has really amazing hair.

18:16.458 --> 18:18.417
She has amazing hair,
she's an amazing person.

18:18.417 --> 18:21.166
She's just not a person
I can have in my life
right now.

18:22.583 --> 18:26.375
And the worst part is, like,
I miss them both, you know?

18:26.375 --> 18:28.708
Like, I love them both
so much,

18:28.708 --> 18:31.917
I don't know who to warn
about the other one.

18:31.917 --> 18:34.000
And I could do
what my instinct is,

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
which is run around
and destroy things
and scream

18:38.000 --> 18:41.166
and try to throw myself
in front of a van
to make a point,

18:41.166 --> 18:43.083
but at the end of the day,
that would just be me

18:43.083 --> 18:44.792
fulfilling all of their
expectations of me,

18:44.792 --> 18:47.917
and I would love
to surprise someone
sometime.

18:47.917 --> 18:52.208
Ooh, no.
Oh, lady, no.

18:52.208 --> 18:53.875
This is so sad.

18:53.875 --> 18:56.333
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

18:56.333 --> 18:59.708
No.
Oh, God.

18:59.708 --> 19:02.917
That hurt me
to hear that.

19:02.917 --> 19:04.542
Mm-mm.

19:05.583 --> 19:07.000
Poor girl.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.667
I could've eaten
seven more hot dogs.

19:08.667 --> 19:09.750
I was just being calm.

19:09.750 --> 19:12.041
Ugh, I feel like
seven hot dogs right now.

19:12.041 --> 19:15.542
Plus, I just can't eat
a lot when someone else
is eating a minimal amount.

19:15.542 --> 19:17.208
I feel like we should've
both just gone for it.

19:17.208 --> 19:20.708
Did you just
see this asshole
not lock his bike?

19:20.708 --> 19:22.875
- No.
- Well, I did,

19:22.875 --> 19:25.625
and I hate it when people
are like, "Oh, it was a sign."

19:25.625 --> 19:27.834
But I think
this is a sign.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.667
I'm not gonna
steal a bike, Tally.

19:29.667 --> 19:30.750
That's what I'm saying.

19:30.750 --> 19:31.792
If you know
what I'm saying,

19:31.792 --> 19:33.125
then you know
you should do it.

19:33.125 --> 19:36.083
Hop a leg over,
get your vagina
on that seat,

19:36.083 --> 19:37.083
and ride into the future.

19:37.083 --> 19:38.625
You know what?
Yes.

19:38.625 --> 19:41.708
People steal things
all the time without
consequences.

19:41.708 --> 19:43.333
- It's my time.
- That's right.

19:43.333 --> 19:45.250
- It's my time.
- Inspired by me.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.083
I've never felt
more alive!

19:47.083 --> 19:48.542
I have a new bike!

19:48.542 --> 19:50.583
Hey, that's my bike!

19:50.583 --> 19:52.000

- Tally: Ah! Go, go!

It's so nice!

20:22.750 --> 20:24.083
Just feel it
in your heart.

20:24.083 --> 20:27.041
I can't even believe
how fast I'm going!

20:27.041 --> 20:29.542
Don't look back, but I look
exactly like a poodle

20:29.542 --> 20:30.959
with her head
sticking out the window.

20:30.959 --> 20:32.250
Whoo!

20:32.250 --> 20:34.959

20:41.458 --> 20:42.959
Okay, bye.

20:42.959 --> 20:46.083
Well, we should smoke
a fatty J, right?

20:47.333 --> 20:48.583
Yeah.

20:48.583 --> 20:49.959
You're fun.

20:49.959 --> 20:51.792
( both laugh )

20:53.125 --> 20:55.667
Okay, that place
is about to turn

20:55.667 --> 20:58.000
into a Manson Family
situation any day now.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.291
I am deeply uncomfortable
with what I have seen.

21:00.291 --> 21:01.667
New York is dead.

21:01.667 --> 21:03.708
The city's no place
for people like us
anymore.

21:03.708 --> 21:06.458
Okay, Hermie,
I know it feels
that way, but, no.

21:06.458 --> 21:08.917
Those hipsters are
a very specific subculture,

21:08.917 --> 21:10.500
a vocal minority,
if you will,

21:10.500 --> 21:11.959
like the Westboro
Baptist Church.

21:11.959 --> 21:13.792
But they may all
be related for all we know.

21:13.792 --> 21:15.708
This is what I propose.

21:15.708 --> 21:20.333
Ray's as a destination
for the anti-hipster.

21:20.333 --> 21:23.375
You talking
about rebranding?

21:23.375 --> 21:25.000
Oh, a heavy rebranding.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Like when
Kentucky Fried Chicken
just became KFC

21:27.000 --> 21:29.834
so people would forget
that they were, you know,
eating Kentucky food?

21:29.834 --> 21:35.083
Gentlemen, it is high time
we start selling coffee
to people with jobs.

21:35.083 --> 21:37.375
- ( coughing )
- Yeah.

21:37.375 --> 21:40.166
Good, beautiful.
Good job.

21:40.166 --> 21:42.125
- ( music playing on radio )
- ( coughing )

21:42.125 --> 21:45.166
Good. Good girl.
Good girl.

21:45.166 --> 21:47.041
I've been so fucking
jealous of you.

21:47.041 --> 21:49.208
What?

21:49.208 --> 21:51.375
You're-- are you kidding?

21:51.375 --> 21:52.917
You're like the bar
against which

21:52.917 --> 21:55.375
I've measured
everything, you know?

21:55.375 --> 21:57.125
It's like, we graduated
from college four years ago,

21:57.125 --> 21:59.333
and so I calculate,
"Oh, it's been four years.

21:59.333 --> 22:03.417
Tally's published two books
of essays and a novel."

22:03.417 --> 22:05.125
And I did a book
of poetry as well.

22:05.125 --> 22:06.917
And you did a book
of poetry as well.

22:06.917 --> 22:08.542
- Yeah.
- And what have I done?

22:08.542 --> 22:10.458
You know?
What have I done
with my life

22:10.458 --> 22:14.875
besides get not one
but two strains of HPV

22:14.875 --> 22:17.542
and gain and lose
a total of 33 pounds?

22:17.542 --> 22:19.959
Oh, man.

22:19.959 --> 22:23.750
That's so crazy
to be jealous of me.

22:23.750 --> 22:27.583
Oh, my God.
Cut the shit,
seriously.

22:29.417 --> 22:31.583
Fair enough.

22:32.667 --> 22:33.959
Yeah.

22:33.959 --> 22:37.583
Yeah, I guess everyone
is jealous of me.

22:37.583 --> 22:39.250
Ugh.

22:40.750 --> 22:42.750
Do you know I google
myself every day?

22:42.750 --> 22:45.667
( laughs )
It's so gross, but I do,

22:45.667 --> 22:48.250
and I just wanna
see if, like, Gawker
or whoever they are

22:48.250 --> 22:51.083
has written some snarky thing
about how much of a hack I am

22:51.083 --> 22:53.166
or if even there's just,
like, a pretty picture of me

22:53.166 --> 22:55.417
in the "Financial Times"
roundup of books of the year.

22:55.417 --> 22:56.708
( sniffles )

22:56.708 --> 23:01.750
I need to see
how other people
see me because...

23:01.750 --> 23:05.625
it's the only way
that I can see myself.

23:07.500 --> 23:11.417
I wake up every morning
and I think, "Well, okay,

23:11.417 --> 23:13.125
what would
Tally Schifrin do?

23:13.125 --> 23:17.041
Tally Schifrin
is not even me now.

23:17.041 --> 23:20.458
She's just, like,
this thing that
I've created.

23:20.458 --> 23:25.125
She's a monster
that I've made
and I have to feed,

23:25.125 --> 23:29.667
and she feeds on praise

23:29.667 --> 23:34.250
and controversy.

23:34.250 --> 23:39.625
And it's exhausting
and boring at once.

23:42.417 --> 23:44.708
And...

23:44.708 --> 23:47.208
I'm too smart to be
exhausted and bored.

23:47.208 --> 23:50.166
And now I have
a book of essays, too,

23:50.166 --> 23:52.083
and not to be, like,
boo-hoo about it,

23:52.083 --> 23:54.834
but it's like what the fuck
am I gonna write an essay on?

23:54.834 --> 23:59.708
All I do
is google myself
and smoke weed

23:59.708 --> 24:02.500
and, um, masturbate
with an electric toothbrush.

24:02.500 --> 24:04.959
- You could afford
a vibrator.
- I know.

24:04.959 --> 24:06.125
I really don't
want one

24:06.125 --> 24:08.375
and that makes me
feel mentally ill.

24:08.375 --> 24:10.792
( sniffles )

24:10.792 --> 24:13.458
Today's,
like, the most fun
I've had in...

24:15.375 --> 24:17.792
like 17 months.

24:17.792 --> 24:20.250
I just thought you
woke up in the morning

24:20.250 --> 24:23.708
in, like, a ray of sunshine
and, like, birds dressed you

24:23.708 --> 24:26.542
and you just,
like, came in your pants
from all the accolades,

24:26.542 --> 24:30.166
and then people handed you
awards on your way to,
like, a fancy dinner.

24:30.166 --> 24:32.875
Yeah. Yeah.
( chuckles )

24:32.875 --> 24:37.542
Uh, I guess that's how
you're supposed to feel,

24:37.542 --> 24:40.333
like,
by my calculations, but...

24:44.875 --> 24:47.208
Look at you.

24:47.208 --> 24:50.041
You've had all these,
like, boyfriends

24:50.041 --> 24:54.208
and jobs and moments.

24:54.208 --> 24:58.208
And you've lived
all this truth.

24:58.208 --> 25:01.750
It didn't feel like very much
while it was happening.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.750
But it is much.

25:03.750 --> 25:06.834
And you have
so much to say.

25:06.834 --> 25:09.959
And look at your
little freckles.

25:09.959 --> 25:13.542
Look at your little freckles
all over your little face.

25:13.542 --> 25:15.083
And you have
little tiny teeth.

25:15.083 --> 25:17.834
They're so--
little side teeth.

25:17.834 --> 25:19.333
- These teeth?
- Mm-hmm.

25:19.333 --> 25:20.625
I don't even know
if they're real.

25:20.625 --> 25:22.708
- I love them.
- Oh, thank you.

25:22.708 --> 25:24.750
Yeah, I love
them so much.

25:24.750 --> 25:27.291
It's so nice.

25:31.667 --> 25:33.583
Should we have sex?

25:33.583 --> 25:36.583
Should we?

25:40.000 --> 25:41.041
Probably not.

27:15.542 --> 27:16.917
Come again?

27:35.166 --> 27:37.375

is a love dream?

27:38.792 --> 27:41.583
