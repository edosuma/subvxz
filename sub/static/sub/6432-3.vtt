an arsenal of artifacts.

- He stored them in these crates

Well, if you find Jesse--

20:37.802 --> 20:40.104
please don't hurt him.
He's still my son.

20:43.041 --> 20:45.142
- Thank you.
- Bye.

20:45.176 --> 20:47.278
Bye.

20:49.914 --> 20:51.815
No sign of the hollow man yet.

20:54.119 --> 20:55.553
Well, just keep
your eyes open.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.322
[Sighs] You do know
he's invisible, right?

20:57.356 --> 20:58.757
Well, then keep
your ears open.

20:58.791 --> 21:00.359
You know, you're really
not supposed to be watching

21:00.393 --> 21:01.460
the dressing room monitors.

21:01.494 --> 21:02.828
I mean, it's corporate policy.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.797
Oh, it's okay.
I'm a federal agent.

21:04.831 --> 21:06.065
Also, I'm gay.

21:06.099 --> 21:09.068
Oh, my God.
Do you watch <i>Revenge?</i>

21:09.103 --> 21:10.837
- No...
- Steve.

21:10.871 --> 21:12.872
Steve, I heard something.

21:15.709 --> 21:18.810
Claudia,
he's right behind you.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.011
Wha--you can see him?

21:20.046 --> 21:21.179
Yeah, you're looking
right at him.

21:21.214 --> 21:23.348
Where, exactly?

21:23.383 --> 21:27.152
- He shows up on camera.
- Wha--hey.

21:31.790 --> 21:34.225
[Thud]
Whoa.

21:34.259 --> 21:37.195
Check this out.

21:37.229 --> 21:40.131
Invisible to the naked eye,
but not the digital one.

21:40.166 --> 21:41.833
Huh.

21:41.867 --> 21:43.368
All right.

21:43.402 --> 21:44.969
Let's see.

21:45.003 --> 21:46.704
Uh-huh.

21:46.738 --> 21:47.838
Aha.

21:47.873 --> 21:49.840
I'm definitely having
a panic attack.

21:49.874 --> 21:51.008
Cool shades.

21:51.042 --> 21:52.943
What's going on?

21:52.978 --> 21:53.978
I can't see anything.

21:54.012 --> 21:55.179
[Zap]

21:55.213 --> 21:57.214
Just a side effect
of your peek-a-boo shades.

21:57.248 --> 21:58.782
You'll be blind for twice as
long as you were wearing them.

21:58.817 --> 22:01.052
But I had them on for hours.

22:01.086 --> 22:02.687
I didn't hurt anyone.
I was just--

22:02.721 --> 22:04.222
Window shopping, we know.

22:04.256 --> 22:05.390
Your eyesight will come back,

22:05.424 --> 22:07.058
but I'd say you lost
your job for good.

22:07.092 --> 22:08.860
You okay?

22:08.894 --> 22:10.128
Hmm? Oh, yeah.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.731
Must just be sore from too much
pop physique yesterday.

22:12.765 --> 22:14.300
Come on, we've got more
artifact shopping to do.

22:14.334 --> 22:17.770
First point to you, poopypants.

22:17.805 --> 22:19.405
You know, I prefer Jinksie.

22:29.751 --> 22:31.752
Thank you.

22:31.787 --> 22:34.155
Yeah, okay, so Hank Conway...

22:34.189 --> 22:36.891
checked in for his tee time,
but nobody's seen him since.

22:36.925 --> 22:38.692
Artie, look.
Artie!

22:41.429 --> 22:44.564
Golfers don't usually
leave those lying around.

22:54.975 --> 22:56.342
BJ.

22:56.376 --> 22:58.344
Bobby Jones.
Oh, my God.

22:58.378 --> 23:01.881
These are the clubs Bobby Jones
used in the 1921 British Open.

23:01.915 --> 23:04.517
His temper got the better of
him, he stormed off the course,

23:04.551 --> 23:08.187
but not before throwing these
clubs all over the green.

23:08.221 --> 23:09.555
Oh, well, we better

23:09.589 --> 23:11.590
keep them away from
John McEnroe's tennis racket.

23:11.624 --> 23:16.528
[Chuckles] Yeah, but why
are they just lying here?

23:16.563 --> 23:18.197
Sand wedge--

23:18.231 --> 23:19.865
eh, uh, the 9-iron's missing.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.266
I think Conway's
probably got it.

23:21.301 --> 23:23.302
I don't think so.

23:23.336 --> 23:27.071
According to the photo
we got off the internet--

23:27.106 --> 23:29.074
Uh-huh.

23:29.108 --> 23:31.543
You must be Mr. Conway.

23:31.577 --> 23:34.012
Bit of a headache.

23:35.414 --> 23:36.914
Okay, so we are
up and running.

23:36.948 --> 23:40.317
So if the pipe creates storms,
it also creates a, uh,

23:40.351 --> 23:43.187
- a low-pressure front, right?
- Exactly.

23:43.221 --> 23:45.356
And if Jesse's raising the roof,
we'll be able to track him

23:45.390 --> 23:47.791
on weather radar.

23:47.826 --> 23:51.862
- That's really smart, Pete.
- Ha ha!

23:51.896 --> 23:54.298
Man, I feel just like
Helen Hunt in <i>Twister.</i>

23:54.332 --> 23:55.999
Bill Paxton.

23:56.033 --> 23:59.703
I mean I feel like Bill Paxton.

23:59.737 --> 24:01.071
- Hey, Helen?
- Ugh.

24:01.105 --> 24:02.505
You wanna take a look at that?

24:02.540 --> 24:04.808
Oh, look at that.
Looks like we got

24:04.842 --> 24:06.810
a Jesse front moving in
from the northeast.

24:06.844 --> 24:10.046
Right, it's--it's, uh,
centering on the corner

24:10.081 --> 24:13.349
of Glenwood
and Eagle Crest road.

24:13.383 --> 24:15.484
- Okay. Watch this.
- What are you doing?

24:15.519 --> 24:17.620
Voice: After the beep,
please say a command.

24:17.654 --> 24:21.791
Uh, destination Glenwood
and Eagle Crest.

24:21.825 --> 24:25.861
Voice:
Glenwood and Eagle Crest.

24:25.896 --> 24:27.397
- See?
- Oh.

24:27.431 --> 24:28.965
Thank you, Clarice.

24:28.999 --> 24:31.301
Now, could you whip me up some
chocolate chip cookies?

24:31.335 --> 24:32.835
[Laughs]

24:32.870 --> 24:35.805
Voice: You have arrived
at your destination.

24:37.340 --> 24:38.908
Help!
Help, he's crazy!

24:38.942 --> 24:40.142
Let me guess.

24:40.176 --> 24:41.410
A rogue tornado
came out of nowhere.

24:41.444 --> 24:43.145
Yeah.
Threw the truck around

24:43.179 --> 24:44.746
and knocked me out.

24:44.781 --> 24:46.915
Next thing I know, some stupid
kid is handcuffing me

24:46.949 --> 24:48.383
- to this railing.
- Where is he?

24:48.417 --> 24:50.218
In there.

24:50.253 --> 24:51.786
He's wasting his time.

24:51.821 --> 24:53.521
It's an armored truck
with a time lock.

24:53.556 --> 24:55.289
He'll never break in.

24:55.324 --> 24:56.824
[Boom, crash]

24:56.858 --> 24:58.759
Yeah, keep telling
yourself that.

24:58.794 --> 25:01.728
Just--you just--
just stay here.

25:01.763 --> 25:02.763
Oh, okay.

25:02.797 --> 25:05.866
[Whoosh, thunder, crackle]
Whoa.

25:05.900 --> 25:10.036
[Buzz, crackle, buzz]

25:15.877 --> 25:17.912
Jesse Ashton?

25:17.946 --> 25:20.581
Let us see your hands.

25:20.616 --> 25:21.883
Okay, look, kid.

25:21.917 --> 25:24.552
You don't know
what you're holding there.

25:24.586 --> 25:26.420
Really?
I think it's a magic pipe

25:26.454 --> 25:27.955
that lets me control
the weather.

25:27.989 --> 25:29.523
Okay, maybe you do.

25:29.558 --> 25:32.126
Hand it over.

25:32.160 --> 25:33.961
Jesse, listen,
you don't understand.

25:33.996 --> 25:35.630
No, you don't understand.

25:35.664 --> 25:38.098
I'm running out of time.
I need this.

25:40.334 --> 25:42.436
Somebody could get hurt, kid.

25:42.470 --> 25:44.771
I know.
It might even be you.

25:44.806 --> 25:46.740
Heads up.
[Whistling]

25:46.774 --> 25:47.741
Hey, is that a--

25:47.775 --> 25:49.443
that looks like a--

25:49.477 --> 25:51.044
look out, Mykes!

25:51.076 --> 25:53.077
[Crash, boom]

26:08.591 --> 26:09.860
[Coughs]

26:09.894 --> 26:10.994
Ow.

26:11.028 --> 26:13.296
[Groans]
Oh...

26:13.330 --> 26:15.799
Did he just drop a truck
on us?

26:15.833 --> 26:16.800
Yeah.

26:16.834 --> 26:18.001
And he'd better be gone!

26:18.035 --> 26:20.670
Yeah, you'd better be gone!

26:20.705 --> 26:23.340
Yeah, he's gone.

26:23.374 --> 26:25.109
So--so, what, he--

26:25.143 --> 26:29.646
he drops the armored truck,
he--he--

26:29.680 --> 26:32.249
cracks it open, and--

26:32.283 --> 26:35.118
oh, yeah.
Takes all the money inside.

26:35.153 --> 26:36.854
Yup. It's the piggy
bank principle,

26:36.888 --> 26:38.622
but on a bigger scale.

26:38.656 --> 26:41.125
Okay. There's something else
going on with him, though.

26:41.159 --> 26:42.994
Did you see the bandage
on his arm?

26:43.028 --> 26:45.029
I mean, it's kind of like
the ones they use

26:45.063 --> 26:46.197
when you get your blood drawn.

26:46.231 --> 26:47.999
Right, right.
And, uh, but he had that, uh--

26:48.033 --> 26:49.334
the medical book at his house.

26:49.368 --> 26:50.635
Right, the book on anatomy.

26:50.669 --> 26:52.203
- Blood test.
- Money.

26:52.238 --> 26:56.107
He said that he was running
out of time.

26:56.142 --> 26:59.811
Pete, what if Jesse's sick?

26:59.845 --> 27:01.546
I don't understand.

27:01.580 --> 27:04.182
My wife's been begging me
to take her golfing.

27:04.216 --> 27:05.617
Yeah, okay, wh--these clubs.

27:05.651 --> 27:07.486
You bought these
at the pawn shop downtown?

27:07.520 --> 27:09.622
I wasn't gonna get her
a new set of Callaways.

27:09.656 --> 27:11.724
I want her to hate it.

27:11.758 --> 27:13.226
Golf is my hobby.

27:13.260 --> 27:15.028
It's my time to hang out
with the guys.

27:15.063 --> 27:16.430
And somebody's supposed
to stay home

27:16.464 --> 27:17.664
and do the cooking
and the cleaning?

27:17.698 --> 27:19.666
No, she's a terrible cook.

27:19.701 --> 27:21.135
I wonder why she hit you?

27:21.169 --> 27:23.905
Okay, so where
is the 9-iron?

27:23.939 --> 27:25.406
Wha--after she whacked
me with it?

27:25.440 --> 27:26.908
- Yeah.
- No idea.

27:26.942 --> 27:28.643
Okay, as long as she's
got that 9-iron,

27:28.677 --> 27:31.713
the slightest annoyance is gonna
magnify into a furious rage.

27:31.747 --> 27:33.281
My guess is she's taken
a divot

27:33.315 --> 27:35.083
out of one of
your hang-out buddies.

27:35.117 --> 27:37.919
Where would they be right now?

27:41.089 --> 27:42.790
Oh, hey, Janet.

27:42.824 --> 27:44.225
Where's Hank?
We're gonna miss our tee time.

27:44.259 --> 27:46.260
[Thwack]
Oh!

27:46.295 --> 27:48.763
Janet, what the hell?

27:48.797 --> 27:51.899
Every single weekend
with you idiots,

27:51.934 --> 27:54.235
and the Christmas lights
are still up!

27:59.975 --> 28:02.410
[Birds chirping]

28:02.445 --> 28:04.946
[Whispering]
What do you need?

28:04.980 --> 28:06.080
Hey, Claud, look.
Myka needs the--

28:06.115 --> 28:07.682
Psst! Quietly.

28:07.716 --> 28:11.018
[Whispering] Myka needs the
32-bit decryption code thingy

28:11.052 --> 28:13.854
- to access the hospital records.
- Yeah, got it.

28:13.888 --> 28:14.854
Emailing now.

28:14.889 --> 28:16.422
Why are we whispering?

28:16.457 --> 28:18.759
'Cause of the killer birds.

28:18.793 --> 28:22.129
[Squawk, squeak, squawk]

28:22.163 --> 28:24.698
Right...

28:24.732 --> 28:27.200
See ya.

28:27.235 --> 28:28.702
So sorry.
Won't take a sec.

28:28.736 --> 28:32.139
[Birds calling, squawking]
Yeah, no rush.

28:32.173 --> 28:33.674
At least now we know
what the birdcage does.

28:36.611 --> 28:37.611
Okay.

28:37.646 --> 28:38.712
The Prius is backed up
to the door.

28:38.747 --> 28:40.614
On my count,
you toss me the cage,

28:40.649 --> 28:41.849
we sprint for the neutralizer
tank in the trunk.

28:41.884 --> 28:43.218
Easy peasy.

28:43.252 --> 28:45.187
What about Woodstock
and Tweety

28:45.221 --> 28:46.521
and all their friends?

28:46.556 --> 28:48.523
He's got his eyes on my eyes.

28:48.558 --> 28:50.359
[Squawking]

28:50.393 --> 28:53.762
Yeah. Did you not
hear me say "sprint"?

28:53.796 --> 28:55.197
Okay, one--two--

28:55.231 --> 28:57.533
oh, this counts as my point
in the scavenger hunt, right?

28:57.567 --> 28:59.735
- Claudia.
- Three!

28:59.769 --> 29:03.038
[Birds squawking,
Claudia yelling indistinctly]

29:04.574 --> 29:06.442
Oh, ah.
God, they got me.

29:06.476 --> 29:09.144
- Where?
- Ah, right there.

29:09.179 --> 29:10.479
- I don't see anything.
- Are you sure?

29:10.513 --> 29:12.781
Yeah, there's not a scratch.
You're okay.

29:12.816 --> 29:14.083
Oh, God, no.

29:14.117 --> 29:15.751
This is karma for playing
too much <i>Angry Birds.</i>

29:15.786 --> 29:19.389
God, I can feel it.
Ow.

29:31.402 --> 29:34.338
We were supposed to go
to the flower show.

29:34.372 --> 29:36.006
But no!

29:36.040 --> 29:37.341
"I can't, dear.
I've gotta spend

29:37.375 --> 29:39.643
eight hours getting drunk
with my buddies!"

29:39.677 --> 29:42.579
- Janet, please!
- Put that club down!

29:42.613 --> 29:43.847
- No.
- Artie, be careful.

29:43.881 --> 29:45.281
With that aura
she could kill somebody.

29:45.316 --> 29:47.250
Oh, I can handle her--
whoa!

29:49.887 --> 29:50.886
Oh, look, there's Hank.

29:50.921 --> 29:52.321
Where?

29:52.355 --> 29:54.123
[Buzz]
Oh!

29:54.157 --> 29:57.660
All right, get the neutralizer
from my bag.

29:57.694 --> 29:58.661
[Buzz, crackle]

29:58.695 --> 29:59.662
Get the neutralizer now!

29:59.696 --> 30:00.997
Artie, just toss me the club.

30:01.031 --> 30:02.832
What? Just hand it over?

30:02.866 --> 30:03.900
Sure, that's what
everybody wants.

30:03.934 --> 30:05.502
I do all the work!

30:05.536 --> 30:06.703
And nobody knows.

30:06.737 --> 30:09.506
I'm the one
who risked everything,

30:09.540 --> 30:12.008
who was asked to sacrifice

30:12.043 --> 30:14.511
[buzz, crackle]
Everything that he loves!

30:14.545 --> 30:17.247
And I can't even tell anyone

30:17.281 --> 30:21.117
that I saved them.

30:22.853 --> 30:24.053
Unh-ow.

30:26.356 --> 30:28.624
Oh, thanks.

30:28.659 --> 30:31.327
Eh, some bad juju
on that club.

30:31.361 --> 30:33.229
Artie, what was that about?

30:33.263 --> 30:35.697
- What was what about?
- What you just said.

30:35.732 --> 30:37.332
Said about what?
I don't, wh--I don't know.

30:37.366 --> 30:39.267
Artie, your anger was stemming
from something very--

30:39.301 --> 30:41.602
Nothing. What?
I'm always angry.

30:41.637 --> 30:43.170
That's my raison d'etre.
Ask anybody.

30:43.205 --> 30:44.538
Grumble, grumble.
Let's go!

30:51.846 --> 30:57.217
[Beeping]

30:57.251 --> 30:58.884
[Knock at door]

30:58.919 --> 31:01.854
- Mrs. Ashton.
- Did you find Jesse?

31:01.888 --> 31:03.355
No.

31:03.390 --> 31:06.691
We, um--we tracked
Jesse's medical records,

31:06.726 --> 31:08.760
thinking he had some sort
of blood test,

31:08.795 --> 31:10.462
but we found out that
he's been making

31:10.497 --> 31:15.701
donations to a, um...
Ronald Ashton.

31:15.735 --> 31:18.570
For Ronnie.
His little brother.

31:18.605 --> 31:20.973
And--and that would be
Ronnie?

31:21.007 --> 31:23.142
Yes.
I knew it.

31:23.176 --> 31:26.411
We'd been getting
donations anonymously.

31:26.446 --> 31:28.680
They have a rare blood type.

31:28.715 --> 31:31.149
Deep down, I knew it.

31:31.184 --> 31:34.419
You see,
Jesse's not a bad person.

31:34.454 --> 31:36.922
He's always loved
his little brother.

31:36.956 --> 31:39.458
Mrs. Ashton, what--
what happened to Ronnie?

31:39.492 --> 31:41.593
Heart infection.

31:41.628 --> 31:43.429
Myocarditis.

31:43.463 --> 31:46.131
He's taken a bad turn
these past few days.

31:46.165 --> 31:48.333
Uh-huh.

31:48.368 --> 31:49.901
Is that why Jesse's
robbing banks?

31:49.936 --> 31:51.636
He's what?

31:51.671 --> 31:53.505
Oh, my God.

31:53.539 --> 31:57.675
Jesse's obviously trying
to help, but, um.

31:57.710 --> 31:59.310
People are getting hurt.

31:59.344 --> 32:03.047
Oh, we've been drowning
in bills, but--

32:03.082 --> 32:05.116
Oh, Jesse, what are you doing?

32:05.151 --> 32:07.018
Paging Dr. Gellar.

32:07.053 --> 32:09.321
Dr. Gellar,
please report to the OR.

32:09.355 --> 32:10.856
[Thud]
Who are you?

32:10.890 --> 32:12.290
What are you doing in my office?

32:12.325 --> 32:14.292
My brother, Ronnie Ashton.

32:14.327 --> 32:16.027
The doctors said
that he needed surgery.

32:16.062 --> 32:17.863
I mean, we can pay for it now,
okay?

32:17.897 --> 32:20.632
- Money isn't the only issue--
- That is bull!

32:20.667 --> 32:22.367
You and the insurance guys

32:22.402 --> 32:23.969
and that stupid bank have been
bleeding my mom dry

32:24.003 --> 32:25.504
since Ronnie got sick.

32:25.538 --> 32:27.239
Look, with his condition,

32:27.274 --> 32:29.642
we need to find
a suitable donor.

32:29.676 --> 32:32.545
Even then, there are--there
are dozens of other factors--

32:32.579 --> 32:34.280
I-I don't care about
other factors.

32:34.314 --> 32:36.148
I can get you all
the money you need.

32:36.183 --> 32:37.550
Just fix my brother.

32:37.584 --> 32:40.052
It's more complicated
than that.

32:43.590 --> 32:46.358
Then maybe I need
to simplify it for you.

32:47.393 --> 32:48.960
[Whimpers]

32:48.995 --> 32:50.395
Mrs. Ashton,
we need to find Jesse.

32:50.430 --> 32:53.699
Do you have any idea--

32:53.733 --> 32:55.567
He's here, Mykes.

32:55.602 --> 32:56.735
- What?
- Jesse.

32:56.769 --> 32:57.736
He's in the hospital.

32:57.771 --> 33:02.508
[Thunder claps]

33:06.714 --> 33:08.048
Pete, the roof.

33:08.082 --> 33:11.351
There's a storm forming
over the roof.

33:14.089 --> 33:17.358
Whoo!

33:19.761 --> 33:21.128
Whoo!

33:23.565 --> 33:25.466
Now do you see what I can do?

33:31.006 --> 33:32.406
[Zap]

33:32.441 --> 33:33.741
Ah!

33:33.775 --> 33:37.345
You shoot lightning too?
That's our thing!

33:37.379 --> 33:39.047
Why won't you
two leave me alone?

33:39.081 --> 33:41.884
Jesse, listen to me.
We know why you're doing this.

33:41.918 --> 33:43.952
Okay, we know about
your brother!

33:43.987 --> 33:45.354
Then make them do it!

33:45.388 --> 33:46.956
I can pay for it.

33:46.990 --> 33:48.524
Ronnie cannot die.

33:48.558 --> 33:50.359
Yeah, but other people will

33:50.394 --> 33:52.528
if you don't give us that pipe!

33:52.562 --> 33:54.263
No. No!

33:54.297 --> 33:57.232
I'm in control now,
for once.

33:57.267 --> 33:59.969
Screw other people.
You tell them

34:00.003 --> 34:03.138
that they got one hour
to start fixing Ronnie,

34:03.173 --> 34:06.875
or I turn this hospital into
a pile of rocks.

34:06.909 --> 34:07.976
No!

34:10.205 --> 34:11.672
- Aah!
- Uhh!

34:23.047 --> 34:25.614
[Wind howling]

34:25.649 --> 34:27.817
[Thunder rumbling]

34:30.219 --> 34:32.822
Look, you need to get everyone
into the basement, all right?

34:32.856 --> 34:35.591
I can't fit an entire hospital
full of patients

34:35.626 --> 34:37.994
into the basement.
Can't you stop him?

34:38.027 --> 34:39.795
Look, I'm not a big fan
of "give the terrorist

34:39.830 --> 34:41.630
what he wants,"
but wouldn't it be easier

34:41.665 --> 34:43.533
to just give
his brother the surgery?

34:43.568 --> 34:44.701
I tried to tell him.

34:44.735 --> 34:48.706
Ronnie's myocarditis
is too advanced.

34:48.739 --> 34:50.206
He needs a heart transplant.

34:50.242 --> 34:52.443
All right, so just pop
a new ticker into the kid.

34:52.476 --> 34:54.311
- They do it every day.
- Pete, finding a compatible

34:54.346 --> 34:56.780
donor heart is very
difficult and specific.

34:56.815 --> 34:57.815
No, I know, I--

34:57.849 --> 34:59.617
We thought we had
one last week,

34:59.651 --> 35:01.319
but the organ wasn't viable.

35:01.353 --> 35:02.854
We're still looking,

35:02.888 --> 35:05.323
but the odds of finding
a compatible heart

35:05.358 --> 35:07.959
in the time that Ronnie
has now are--

35:07.994 --> 35:09.294
[thunder rumbling]
Oh!

35:09.328 --> 35:10.462
Are not good.
I get it.

35:10.496 --> 35:14.433
I'll talk to security
about evacuation.

35:14.467 --> 35:15.434
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:15.468 --> 35:16.702
Hey.

35:16.736 --> 35:18.237
There is a storm on the roof.
What did we miss?

35:18.271 --> 35:20.005
Yeah, well, Jesse's up there,
and if the hospital doesn't

35:20.040 --> 35:22.041
give his brother a heart
transplant in the next hour,

35:22.075 --> 35:23.309
he's gonna level the place.

35:23.343 --> 35:24.443
So we missed a lot.

35:24.478 --> 35:25.544
We have to get up there
and stop him.

35:25.579 --> 35:26.979
The trouble is,
we just tried that,

35:27.014 --> 35:29.582
and he just blew us off.

35:29.617 --> 35:30.750
Eh, I don't mean
he was being rude.

35:30.784 --> 35:32.819
I mean he literally blew us
off the roof.

35:32.853 --> 35:35.221
There's gotta be some way
to get the drop on him.

35:35.255 --> 35:36.723
Actually, it's a little not
by the manual,

35:36.757 --> 35:41.126
and Artie would be pissed,
but--we may have a solution.

35:47.334 --> 35:49.569
Jesse!

35:49.603 --> 35:51.404
Look, I'm unarmed.

35:51.439 --> 35:53.941
Okay, I-I don't want
to hurt you, I just--

35:53.975 --> 35:54.941
I just want to talk.

35:54.976 --> 35:56.543
Have they started surgery yet?

35:56.578 --> 35:58.212
They will.

35:58.246 --> 36:00.581
Okay, they're looking as hard
as they can for--for a--

36:00.616 --> 36:02.750
[zap]
Ah!

36:02.785 --> 36:04.052
That's close enough.

36:04.086 --> 36:06.354
Jesse, they need more time.

36:06.389 --> 36:07.823
No!

36:07.857 --> 36:09.892
You've seen him!
He's out of time.

36:11.828 --> 36:12.961
Look, what about
everyone else?

36:12.995 --> 36:15.197
Okay, what about
the other patients downstairs?

36:15.231 --> 36:16.198
I don't care.

36:16.232 --> 36:18.233
He's my little brother.

36:18.267 --> 36:20.001
I don't understand--
I got the money.

36:20.035 --> 36:21.536
Why won't they help him?

36:21.570 --> 36:25.473
Now you see me...

36:25.508 --> 36:27.342
Now, you don't.

36:29.645 --> 36:31.846
Listen, Ronnie's
a good kid, okay?

36:31.881 --> 36:35.551
He never did anything wrong.
He's--he's smart,

36:35.585 --> 36:38.287
he's funny, he's got a future,
okay?

36:38.321 --> 36:40.056
And I'm not gonna let

36:40.090 --> 36:42.358
some crappy, greedy hospital
take that from him.

36:47.164 --> 36:50.133
Who's there?

36:54.771 --> 36:56.438
You can see me, can't you?

36:56.472 --> 36:58.707
[Grunts]
Get away from me.

37:03.679 --> 37:05.613
- Pete!
- [Grunting]

37:05.647 --> 37:08.749
I'm getting the feeling
we're near the edge here, right?

37:08.784 --> 37:09.951
It's over, Jesse.

37:09.985 --> 37:12.286
Don't make me shoot you.

37:18.627 --> 37:20.195
Why won't they help him?

37:20.229 --> 37:25.033
They don't have
a compatible heart.

37:25.068 --> 37:27.836
The donor needs to be
a perfect match.

37:27.871 --> 37:29.905
We're sorry, man.

37:29.940 --> 37:32.441
Okay, just--

37:32.476 --> 37:34.410
there's nothing anyone can do.

37:36.780 --> 37:40.382
Okay.
I understand.

37:42.118 --> 37:44.887
Tell Ronnie--

37:44.921 --> 37:48.991
I'm sorry.

37:49.025 --> 37:52.594
I wish I was a better brother.

37:52.628 --> 37:54.996
I wasn't ever there for him.

37:59.768 --> 38:01.970
Now I can be.

38:02.004 --> 38:04.438
Jesse, no!
Jesse, wait!

38:10.279 --> 38:11.245
What is it?
Mykes!

38:11.280 --> 38:13.448
Mykes, Mykes, what happened?

38:13.482 --> 38:14.683
- Pete. Pete.
- Myka!

38:14.717 --> 38:17.219
He's--he's dead.

38:18.855 --> 38:21.990
Is it over?

38:22.025 --> 38:24.559
Yeah.

38:28.832 --> 38:31.000
Mrs. Garner--

38:31.034 --> 38:33.402
Jesse's a compatible donor,
right?

38:33.437 --> 38:37.773
I mean, he's a match
for his brother Ronnie?

38:37.808 --> 38:39.375
Get a gurney.

38:39.409 --> 38:41.343
And page Dr. Gellar.

38:41.378 --> 38:42.511
I'll notify the OR.

38:42.545 --> 38:46.849
To get ready for
an organ transplant.

38:46.883 --> 38:48.951
We couldn't save him,
Pete.

38:50.753 --> 38:53.922
He got what he wanted,
Mykes.

38:53.956 --> 38:56.658
He saved his brother after all.

39:00.798 --> 39:02.843
Ow, ow, ow, ow.
Ow!

39:02.877 --> 39:03.844
You're such a wimp.

39:03.878 --> 39:07.114
Well, you know, it hurts.

39:07.148 --> 39:09.516
Ooh. [Laughs]

39:09.651 --> 39:11.719
Naughty.

39:11.753 --> 39:13.889
Hey, uh, that nurse was hot,
right?

39:13.923 --> 39:16.925
- Still having vision issues?
- A little blurry.

39:16.960 --> 39:18.561
She was totally your type.
I'll give her your number.

39:18.595 --> 39:20.229
Shwing.

39:20.264 --> 39:21.831
So, how's Ronnie?

39:21.865 --> 39:24.600
Well, he's still in surgery,
but the heart's a perfect match,

39:24.634 --> 39:26.435
so they think it'll work.

39:26.469 --> 39:30.373
I just can't stop thinking
about what--what Jesse did.

39:30.407 --> 39:32.909
You know, giving his brother
a second chance like that.

39:32.943 --> 39:34.977
Yeah, the things we do
for family, huh?

39:35.012 --> 39:37.647
Yeah. Well, now we can finally
dot the "I"s on the end

39:37.681 --> 39:38.782
of Walter Sykes.

39:38.816 --> 39:40.283
Thank God.
Oh, and hey--

39:40.317 --> 39:43.052
let's never mention Dr. Evil's
name again, shall we?

39:43.086 --> 39:44.220
- [Sighs]
- Deal!

39:44.254 --> 39:45.621
Where's Artie and Leena?

39:45.656 --> 39:47.290
Already on their way back
to the Warehouse with the booty.

39:47.324 --> 39:49.192
- Well, who's hungry?
- You are.

39:49.226 --> 39:50.293
At all times.

39:50.327 --> 39:51.928
Oh, there's this great diner
in town.

39:51.963 --> 39:54.631
We snagged Maurice Vermersch's
waffle iron there earlier today.

39:54.666 --> 39:55.632
Makes the greatest waffles
in the world.

39:55.667 --> 39:56.633
Ooh, what's the downside?

39:56.668 --> 39:58.168
You can't have just one.

39:58.203 --> 39:59.336
No, actually it makes
your skin melt.

39:59.371 --> 40:03.173
Ooh, well, Pete love waffles.

40:03.207 --> 40:04.207
Oh, Myka.
Can you tell me something?

40:04.242 --> 40:06.409
- Do I have a scratch on my neck?
- Where?

40:06.443 --> 40:07.544
Right there.

40:07.578 --> 40:09.379
I don't see anything.
You're fine.

40:09.413 --> 40:12.015
Yeah, really?
That is so weird.

40:14.685 --> 40:16.619
Ow!

40:16.654 --> 40:18.922
God, what now?

40:29.701 --> 40:32.436
[Whimpers, growls]

40:35.707 --> 40:37.274
[Distant thud]

40:40.211 --> 40:42.379
[Footsteps]

40:46.251 --> 40:47.552
Okay.

40:47.586 --> 40:49.520
I put the clubs next
to Buddy Rich's drums.

40:49.555 --> 40:51.823
The two energies should cancel
each other out.

40:51.857 --> 40:53.258
As long as Pete
can't find them

40:53.293 --> 40:55.527
the next time he decides
to build a putt-putt course

40:55.562 --> 40:57.596
in the ovoid quarantine.

40:57.631 --> 41:00.634
Uh, Artie, about what you said

41:00.668 --> 41:02.569
when you were under
the influence of the club--

41:02.603 --> 41:04.571
Oh, yeah, I told you,
it was nothing.

41:04.605 --> 41:07.373
It was just the idle rantings
of a crazy old Warehouse agent.

41:07.407 --> 41:12.478
I've known you a long time,
Arthur Nielsen.

41:12.512 --> 41:15.213
And ever since Sykes's attack,
I've been seeing--

41:15.247 --> 41:17.449
something different.

41:17.483 --> 41:19.684
And you don't have to tell me,

41:19.718 --> 41:23.888
okay, but whatever burden
you're carrying, please...

41:23.922 --> 41:26.557
Don't carry it alone.

41:52.120 --> 41:54.154
Hello. Yes, it's Arthur.

41:54.189 --> 41:57.257
Yes, I'm at the Warehouse.
Where else would I be?

41:57.292 --> 41:59.393
Uh, listen.

41:59.428 --> 42:03.731
There's something
that I need...done,

42:03.765 --> 42:07.635
and for various reasons
I can't tell Pete or Myka.

42:07.670 --> 42:10.071
Or anybody. Not yet.

42:10.105 --> 42:12.340
Something I need done completely
off the books.

42:12.374 --> 42:13.341
[Woof]

42:13.376 --> 42:16.845
Not a word.
[Whines]

42:16.880 --> 42:19.015
Hmm? Um, no one.

42:19.049 --> 42:20.450
Uh, yes, good.
All right, good,

42:20.484 --> 42:23.052
I'll send you the information.

42:23.087 --> 42:24.520
Yeah.

42:24.555 --> 42:29.559
Well, it's, uh--
I want you to find...

42:29.593 --> 42:32.862
a certain artifact

42:32.897 --> 42:35.062
before it finds me.
