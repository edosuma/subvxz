00:28.952 --> 00:30.276
Fuck is he doing?

00:30.643 --> 00:32.618
Cops still parked
right up the block.

00:33.176 --> 00:34.725
What are we, invisible?

00:35.783 --> 00:37.207
Stupid fucking yos.

00:37.846 --> 00:40.262
Think just fucking with him, man.

00:43.290 --> 00:45.050
You want to wait for him
to serve somebody?

00:45.209 --> 00:46.176
Fuck it.

00:47.310 --> 00:48.677
They're dirty either way.

00:58.941 --> 01:00.670
Hands on the wall, fuckers.

01:02.595 --> 01:03.740
We ain't done nothing!

01:03.900 --> 01:06.482
Seriously. I was just sitting
in my chair reading a magazine, is all.

01:06.642 --> 01:09.375
Watching your crew
work a ground stash, you mean?

01:11.575 --> 01:12.604
What the fuck?

01:16.675 --> 01:17.579
Asshole!

01:18.532 --> 01:20.715
Y'all still taking a charge
for this, you know that?

01:20.874 --> 01:22.501
- You're a truant.
- Today's Saturday.

01:22.661 --> 01:23.585
Try Wednesday.

01:24.110 --> 01:26.338
Why you don't page truancy?
Why y'all locking me up?

01:26.643 --> 01:27.942
Hey, Colicio.

01:28.102 --> 01:29.738
Officer Colicchio, shitbird.

01:31.674 --> 01:33.175
We need to block
every lane here?

01:34.493 --> 01:36.278
Hey, shut it down.
It's a police operation.

01:36.438 --> 01:38.483
Let's get back to your post.
Back these vehicles up.

01:38.643 --> 01:40.309
- Officer.
- I'm not telling you again.

01:40.470 --> 01:41.770
Tony, calm down.

01:43.355 --> 01:45.814
Officer, if you could just move
your car forward Just a little bit,

01:45.974 --> 01:47.490
I'm gonna get right down the road.

02:02.449 --> 02:03.724
We're the police!

02:09.380 --> 02:11.465
What are you doing?
Let me go!

03:55.607 --> 03:56.454
Fuck!

03:57.084 --> 03:58.757
- Problem?
- I spent all day

03:58.916 --> 04:02.029
trying to trace this $80,000 withdrawal
from Clay's personal account...

04:02.336 --> 04:03.482
Figuring it was dirty.

04:03.642 --> 04:06.812
Turns out he's repaying a loan
from his mother-in-law.

04:06.973 --> 04:07.868
A loan?

04:08.027 --> 04:10.996
Has to be. I mean, she gives him
the same amount in 2002.

04:11.155 --> 04:14.864
He uses it as a down payment on
a property that he buys the same week.

04:16.410 --> 04:17.103
See?

04:20.007 --> 04:22.825
He bought a weekend house down
in Calvert county 6 years ago.

04:22.984 --> 04:25.645
You pulled the loan application
on the property, right?

04:27.233 --> 04:28.335
Just a second.

04:30.513 --> 04:31.546
Here you go.

04:35.881 --> 04:36.917
Got him.

04:38.006 --> 04:39.020
The head shot.

04:39.858 --> 04:40.683
What?

04:42.686 --> 04:45.747
And if anyone is suggesting
that I've broken chain of command,

04:45.907 --> 04:47.371
That I've gone behind your back,

04:47.532 --> 04:50.450
that I've lobbied against you
in any way, they're lying.

04:52.339 --> 04:54.103
I don't know who told
the newspaper that,

04:54.263 --> 04:56.253
but they were lying
when they said it.

04:58.306 --> 04:59.425
Yeah.

05:03.173 --> 05:04.413
Respectfully, sir,

05:04.572 --> 05:06.590
I don't know where this shit
is coming from.

05:27.503 --> 05:28.350
Sir...

05:29.464 --> 05:30.865
no one has spoken to me--

05:31.242 --> 05:32.851
Not Carcetti, not anyone.

05:33.708 --> 05:34.846
But if I'm approached,

05:35.006 --> 05:37.328
My answer will be
to decline the position

05:37.572 --> 05:40.279
And say I serve
at your pleasure.

05:46.920 --> 05:47.801
Sir?

05:50.159 --> 05:50.952
Sir?

06:07.405 --> 06:10.238
Go with the preakness piece
Or this one about the firefighter death?

06:10.397 --> 06:13.811
- What are you interviewing for?
- Metro position, Virginia bureau.

06:13.972 --> 06:16.620
Firefighter, I think. Got to show
something I wrote on deadline.

06:16.779 --> 06:18.199
Burrell might get the axe today.

06:18.366 --> 06:20.289
- Who told you that?
- Picked it up on my calls.

06:20.449 --> 06:23.390
Desk Sergeant in the eastern
says it's all over the department.

06:24.138 --> 06:25.079
Wish me luck.

06:25.238 --> 06:26.213
Good luck.

06:29.958 --> 06:33.446
Got a rumor that Burrell is gonna
get fired today if not tomorrow.

06:33.737 --> 06:34.574
Yeah?

06:36.339 --> 06:37.995
- Work it.
- What about Twigg?

06:38.155 --> 06:39.639
With his sources, you know?

06:39.798 --> 06:41.848
I can't throw one at a guy
on his last day, can I?

06:42.521 --> 06:44.142
You work it as best you can.

06:44.302 --> 06:46.835
You are now
my new Senior cop reporter.

06:52.142 --> 06:53.092
Unclaimed.

06:53.741 --> 06:56.154
So far this year... 11.

06:56.868 --> 06:59.990
13 if we add the two in the freezer
I ain't I.D.'ed yet.

07:00.150 --> 07:01.935
Run it for no fixed address.

07:03.578 --> 07:06.426
Jimmy, it'd help if I knew
what the fuck you were looking for.

07:06.587 --> 07:09.360
Body wise, I just want to know where
we're pulling most of the homeless from.

07:09.520 --> 07:10.918
With or without O.D.'s?

07:11.078 --> 07:13.411
Numbers are way up
since Fentanyl showed up.

07:13.572 --> 07:15.228
Throw them in.
The more, the merrier.

07:15.388 --> 07:16.304
All right.

07:18.366 --> 07:19.335
Damn!

07:20.854 --> 07:22.513
They're all dead
and no fixed address?

07:23.975 --> 07:26.097
Dropping like flies
in the southern lately.

07:26.256 --> 07:27.644
Hey, Lester, it's me.

07:27.804 --> 07:29.311
Yeah, in the morgue.

07:29.905 --> 07:32.312
Some 4:00 to 12:00
with a lot of midnight,

07:32.619 --> 07:34.606
And a lot of them
in south Baltimore.

07:35.786 --> 07:38.527
So who do we know working
12:00 to 8:00 in the southern?

07:38.970 --> 07:40.905
2300 in the district.
That'll work.

07:41.065 --> 07:43.177
Jimmy, am I missing something here?

07:43.505 --> 07:44.909
How does this help you?

07:50.771 --> 07:52.978
Don't want none
of that phony gangster shit.

07:53.360 --> 07:54.836
He was old-school.

07:54.997 --> 07:56.913
Funny, I feel like
I should know Butchie,

07:57.073 --> 07:58.638
But I can't place him.

07:58.897 --> 08:00.593
Came up under teensy.

08:01.137 --> 08:04.135
Caught him a slug early.
Took his sight.

08:04.671 --> 08:08.347
Dabbled now and then, but kept it quiet
as a puppy walking on cotton.

08:10.285 --> 08:11.959
This here do just fine.

08:18.969 --> 08:20.349
Have it say,

08:20.702 --> 08:25.452
"Butchie. Woe to them that
call evil good and good evil."

08:27.269 --> 08:30.452
Sign it, "your true and loyal friend,

08:31.016 --> 08:32.412
"Proposition Joe."

08:36.010 --> 08:40.085
You ain't thinking no kindly note
gonna slow Omar coming at us.

08:40.504 --> 08:43.472
It's how I feel.
He was a good man.

08:43.836 --> 08:46.259
- And Marlo?
- Marlo is Marlo, man.

08:46.420 --> 08:49.121
He weren't the one
that put me in this trick bag.

08:49.281 --> 08:53.011
The motherfucker who snuggled up
and whispered in Marlo's ear did that.

08:53.371 --> 08:54.638
I know what you thinking,

08:54.798 --> 08:57.231
And I ain't making a move
against no kin,

08:57.391 --> 08:59.744
Not till I got more to go on than words.

08:59.904 --> 09:02.211
And knowing my sister's son
the way I do,

09:02.371 --> 09:04.803
If the boy got 50 grand
in his pocket,

09:05.003 --> 09:07.769
It ain't gonna be long
before it jump out and find itself

09:07.928 --> 09:09.337
in some salesman hand.

09:09.648 --> 09:11.940
And that kind of goody, we know.

09:12.638 --> 09:15.870
In the meantime, if Omar coming
for any of us, He coming for me,

09:16.136 --> 09:18.170
And out of respect
for that man's skill set,

09:18.330 --> 09:21.638
I'm gonna take myself out
of the lineup after the meet tomorrow.

09:21.798 --> 09:23.993
Till this shit sort itself out,

09:24.637 --> 09:26.598
Cheese gonna watch the shop.

09:27.485 --> 09:28.715
You gonna watch cheese.

09:33.988 --> 09:35.894
Very clean. Very nice.

09:41.355 --> 09:43.377
But this is unnecessary.

09:43.802 --> 09:46.358
It was not our intent
to mislead.

09:46.699 --> 09:49.618
When I spoke before
about the condition of your money,

09:50.061 --> 09:52.365
I was lking... in symbols.

09:53.523 --> 09:56.535
The money, it came from the street,
And so I thought

09:56.695 --> 09:59.704
you came... from the street.

10:00.403 --> 10:01.361
I did.

10:02.936 --> 10:03.836
I do.

10:04.003 --> 10:05.751
It was not the money
that concerned me.

10:05.953 --> 10:08.343
You have been
more than generous,

10:08.503 --> 10:11.662
and this is a gift
of an honorable man, clearly.

10:12.292 --> 10:14.111
But, in accepting such a gift,

10:14.365 --> 10:16.844
we would give you
the wrong impression.

10:25.631 --> 10:27.460
You come from the street, hmm?

10:29.037 --> 10:31.682
The street... doesn't concern us.

10:32.135 --> 10:34.521
We know him down here,
and we trust him.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.617
But... to know more people,

10:38.235 --> 10:39.734
to learn more names,

10:40.502 --> 10:42.607
to have them learn our names...

10:42.962 --> 10:44.789
I'm not here to badmouth Prop Joe.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.041
But people depend on me.

10:47.702 --> 10:49.872
Now, last year,
there was a robbery.

10:51.733 --> 10:54.840
I'm saying, you know, what?
What if this happens again?

10:55.000 --> 10:56.336
Where do that put my people?

10:56.503 --> 10:58.094
That's for you to discuss with Joe.

10:58.724 --> 11:01.010
All I'm asking for
is an insurance policy.

11:01.170 --> 11:02.848
You know, something covers me

11:03.008 --> 11:04.933
- and covers you.
- And covers Joe.

11:12.768 --> 11:16.274
The young man makes a point.

11:16.604 --> 11:17.824
You're right.

11:18.227 --> 11:19.868
These are volatile times.

11:20.407 --> 11:23.284
It is not unreasonable
to carry insurance.

11:24.095 --> 11:27.270
Who can say
what tomorrow will show us?

11:28.773 --> 11:29.742
You go.

11:31.119 --> 11:32.199
Be safe.

11:36.579 --> 11:37.464
Your case.

11:38.935 --> 11:42.291
Oh, y'all came a ways.
Put it to expenses.

11:48.034 --> 11:50.018
If we were to tell him no,

11:50.371 --> 11:51.959
he will still come back.

11:53.335 --> 11:54.894
This he shows us.

11:58.792 --> 12:00.444
But he is not Joe.

12:02.240 --> 12:03.750
He is not Joe.

12:06.318 --> 12:07.708
If I follow this,

12:07.868 --> 12:10.103
the senator's mother-in-law
gave him $80,000

12:10.262 --> 12:13.042
that he used as a down payment
on some property.

12:13.202 --> 12:15.774
Later, he paid the money back,
which makes it a loan.

12:16.077 --> 12:18.081
Which falsifies the loan application.

12:18.241 --> 12:20.674
The moment he signs the application,
he's exposed.

12:20.835 --> 12:24.975
Title XVIII of the U.S. Code,
chapter 47, section 10-14,

12:25.135 --> 12:27.720
Loan and credit applications.
30 years

12:28.153 --> 12:29.736
and not to exceed $1 million.

12:29.896 --> 12:32.320
Over at the U.S. Attorney's office,
they call it "the head shot."

12:32.479 --> 12:33.839
30 years for something

12:33.999 --> 12:36.767
that every kid two years out of college
does with a starter home.

12:36.928 --> 12:40.316
daddy loans you money to qualify;
a couple years later, you pay him back.

12:41.401 --> 12:42.398
30 years.

12:42.937 --> 12:44.600
With leverage like that,

12:45.060 --> 12:46.912
this case needs to go federal.

12:55.707 --> 12:57.175
Outstanding work, detective.

12:57.409 --> 12:59.584
Let me have some time
to digest this.

13:01.756 --> 13:02.715
Counselor,

13:03.158 --> 13:04.095
a moment?

13:08.700 --> 13:10.219
Is there another way to go at this?

13:10.380 --> 13:13.515
- How strong are our theft counts?
- Straightforward document cases,

13:13.767 --> 13:16.635
4 counts. They're a lock.
He stole from his own charities.

13:16.801 --> 13:19.048
We convict,
that's 10 years per count.

13:19.650 --> 13:22.735
Nothing to sneeze at,
even without the bank charge.

13:48.567 --> 13:50.567
You think it might be,
OK for me to sit in

13:50.734 --> 13:53.385
- on one of your budget meetings?
- On our good days.

13:56.568 --> 13:58.597
Ed? This is Scott Templeton.

13:59.800 --> 14:01.208
Good to meet you.
Have a seat.

14:01.739 --> 14:03.019
Give me a second.

14:07.701 --> 14:10.620
Next mouth needs fed
is the right reverend Isaac Cason.

14:10.779 --> 14:12.884
You'd think I was putting
Ray Lewis out to pasture.

14:13.043 --> 14:14.602
All I'm trying to do is dump Burrell.

14:14.762 --> 14:17.846
You want my community to swallow Rawls,
you'd better grease that morsel up good.

14:18.006 --> 14:19.816
It's Rawls for 6 months,
then it's Daniels.

14:19.976 --> 14:22.874
What, you're gonna tell me Daniels
isn't black enough for you guys?

14:23.034 --> 14:24.408
They don't know him.

14:24.568 --> 14:27.301
They know Burrell, qnd they could
get him on the phone when--

14:27.646 --> 14:30.291
Burrell came in here with bad stats.
He lied to my face.

14:30.451 --> 14:32.834
Rawls lied, too, but you're bumping him
to acting commissioner.

14:32.993 --> 14:34.875
Only till Daniels
gets groomed as deputy ops.

14:35.035 --> 14:36.840
We can't fire everyone
all at once, can we?

14:37.000 --> 14:38.408
This isn't getting us anywhere.

14:39.024 --> 14:40.148
Only two more left.

14:40.307 --> 14:43.003
Fine. How can I be of assistance
to the good reverend Cason?

14:43.163 --> 14:44.723
He has property up in Park Heights.

14:44.882 --> 14:46.615
He wants to convert it
to Senior housing.

14:46.775 --> 14:48.606
- Can we accommodate him?
- We're broke, but,

14:48.765 --> 14:51.275
We could steer
some of the hud money his way.

14:51.933 --> 14:53.917
That leaves reverend Myrtle Smith.

14:54.077 --> 14:57.405
She wants to extend parking
to a vacant lot next to her church.

14:57.667 --> 14:59.183
- It's city property.
- That's it?

14:59.343 --> 15:00.484
Last is the least.

15:00.644 --> 15:03.067
We'll get the reverend
a long-Term lease, dollar a year.

15:05.601 --> 15:08.376
Then there's the matter
of McCulloh homes.

15:09.608 --> 15:13.052
That would be the same McCulloh homes
that's adjacent to Andy Krawczyk's

15:13.212 --> 15:15.866
$300 million expansion
of the state office complex.

15:16.025 --> 15:17.816
- It's over 500 units.
- Public housing.

15:17.977 --> 15:20.154
Narrese, you're gonna need
that hope VI money for that.

15:20.313 --> 15:22.886
- Is there any hope VI money to be had?
- It doesn't matter, gentlemen.

15:23.046 --> 15:25.608
All madame president wants
from us is the green light.

15:26.538 --> 15:28.134
You want him gone, right?

15:31.936 --> 15:32.897
It's good stuff.

15:33.592 --> 15:35.886
Some of your feature work
a little wrought

15:36.046 --> 15:38.068
for what we do here
at the "Post" language-wise,

15:38.229 --> 15:41.214
- But it all shows initiative.
- That's the style they want from me,

15:41.533 --> 15:43.007
but to tell you the truth,

15:43.166 --> 15:44.644
I prefer to write it dry.

15:45.001 --> 15:47.454
- You've been in Baltimore long?
- Two years.

15:48.267 --> 15:51.266
Before that, I was at
the "Kansas City Star" for 3 years,

15:51.534 --> 15:53.083
"Wichita Eagle" before that.

15:53.243 --> 15:54.502
The "Sun's" a fine paper.

15:55.716 --> 15:56.992
Before the cutbacks, maybe.

15:57.152 --> 15:59.274
Well, they still beat us
often enough in annapolis

15:59.434 --> 16:01.979
for my Maryland desk
to take them seriously.

16:02.698 --> 16:06.059
You have anything to do with
those ground red stories last year?

16:06.781 --> 16:08.854
It's good stuff,
real good stuff.

16:19.533 --> 16:21.839
You wanted to go
to the page one meeting, right?

16:21.999 --> 16:23.450
Another time, maybe.

16:27.466 --> 16:29.807
Anyway, as he says,
we'll keep the resume on file.

16:29.966 --> 16:31.809
A few more clips,
a little more seasoning,

16:31.969 --> 16:33.622
We'll take another look, OK?

16:35.693 --> 16:37.251
You can just toss that.

16:45.710 --> 16:49.405
That's the plan: to let him
cut his teeth as deputy for operations,

16:49.565 --> 16:52.034
qnd in 6 months, make him.

16:52.509 --> 16:55.733
He's not the spic-and-span boy
they think he is.

16:59.899 --> 17:03.755
He came up in the eastern district,
part of a bad drug unit

17:03.916 --> 17:05.566
that was skimming seized drug money.

17:05.726 --> 17:06.816
I actually had to--

17:06.976 --> 17:10.271
This isn't about Daniels.
You came in with bad stats,

17:10.651 --> 17:12.499
And for the mayor,
that was the last straw.

17:12.657 --> 17:14.039
My numbers were clean.

17:14.199 --> 17:16.497
They had gone through staff review.
You tell Carcetti--

17:16.656 --> 17:18.332
Ervin, it doesn't matter now.

17:18.858 --> 17:19.715
You're done.

17:19.876 --> 17:21.167
Carcetti has moved on you.

17:23.190 --> 17:25.394
You tell him
if he does me like this,

17:25.865 --> 17:26.972
I'll do Daniels.

17:27.247 --> 17:28.239
You kill Daniels,

17:28.398 --> 17:30.677
and we end up with Bill Rawls
as police commissioner.

17:31.299 --> 17:34.221
The ministers, the caucus,
the council-- They'll live with Daniels.

17:34.382 --> 17:35.247
Why?

17:35.856 --> 17:38.972
Because Carcetti gave away
the store just to push you out.

17:39.132 --> 17:40.953
30 pieces of silver each, huh?

17:41.312 --> 17:42.521
We'll have your back.

17:42.892 --> 17:44.213
I promise you.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.575
Full pension

17:45.735 --> 17:46.899
and a transitional job

17:47.059 --> 17:49.190
on the mayor's criminal justice
coordinating council,

17:49.350 --> 17:51.838
And from there,
something down in Washington

17:51.998 --> 17:53.637
with one of the police associations--

17:53.797 --> 17:55.492
6 figures guaranteed.

17:57.290 --> 17:59.621
You go the right way,
and attention will be paid, Ervin.

17:59.781 --> 18:01.248
But you go kicking and screaming,

18:01.490 --> 18:03.997
and no one--
Not the caucus, not the ministers,

18:04.157 --> 18:05.059
not me--

18:06.960 --> 18:08.172
will be there for you.

18:13.231 --> 18:14.177
Your choice.

18:18.830 --> 18:21.643
Press conference tomorrow.
You play out the string.

18:21.969 --> 18:23.635
Carcetti will do the same.

18:38.861 --> 18:42.938
<i>Attention: all unauthorized
vehicles parked on the loading dock</i>

18:43.099 --> 18:44.637
<i>are now being towed.</i>

18:45.165 --> 18:47.371
<i>Attention: all unauthorized...</i>

18:47.531 --> 18:48.791
No one's saying anything?

18:48.951 --> 18:51.166
- I thought you might help me.
- Not even off the record?

18:51.326 --> 18:53.116
- I just need to confirm.
- ...he told you.

18:53.275 --> 18:55.718
E-Dot deadline's creeping up.
Where the hell are we at?

18:55.878 --> 18:57.787
A source at the courthouse
says it's true

18:57.947 --> 18:59.577
he heard it from Steintorf at the hall.

18:59.737 --> 19:02.764
Nothing from the mayor's office,
but they've schedded a press conference.

19:02.924 --> 19:05.644
- What's coming out of headquarters?
- Nothing. Daniels had no comment,

19:05.803 --> 19:07.265
and Rawls won't return my calls.

19:07.425 --> 19:08.915
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

19:09.627 --> 19:12.671
And where the hell is Templeton all day?
He could be throwing calls, too.

19:12.830 --> 19:14.604
My last gift to you, Gus.

19:16.187 --> 19:18.663
It's twigg, and I'm on a deadline,
so cut the bullshit.

19:18.823 --> 19:21.573
Don't tell me they're firing
the police commissioner tonight

19:21.733 --> 19:23.201
and you don't know all about it.

19:24.230 --> 19:25.870
Don't be fucking telling me that.

19:26.265 --> 19:27.779
Lucky I signed off on your ass,

19:27.939 --> 19:29.871
or you'd be
on your way out to boys' village.

19:30.031 --> 19:31.407
And look how you do me.

19:31.568 --> 19:33.671
Not ming around,
not letting me see Bug.

19:33.831 --> 19:36.437
- Is that how you pay back a mother?
- How should I pay you back?

19:36.597 --> 19:38.132
Start by showing a little respect.

19:38.620 --> 19:39.580
That all?

19:40.331 --> 19:43.470
Truth is, things have been
rough around the way.

19:43.930 --> 19:45.896
What you're doing's so good,
thought maybe

19:46.056 --> 19:47.404
you'd throw some ends my way.

19:47.673 --> 19:49.699
Seeing as how I was here for you
and all.

19:49.860 --> 19:51.963
I ain't paying you to be my mother.

20:02.444 --> 20:05.170
The pros from downtown are here.

20:05.560 --> 20:09.108
- What can I do for you gents?
- You got a copy of the shift roster?

20:17.103 --> 20:20.233
- Didn't Oscar get a realtor's license?
- That would be his day job.

20:20.392 --> 20:23.536
My favorite side partner
from my salad days in patrol.

20:23.695 --> 20:24.551
Thank you.

20:25.566 --> 20:27.538
Hard to imagine you in patrol.

20:28.712 --> 20:30.074
Damn if I can find it.

20:30.234 --> 20:32.187
That's why they call it a hole.

20:33.831 --> 20:36.492
That there is the sickest idea yet.
You know that, right?

20:36.653 --> 20:38.584
I'm just gilding your lily, son.

20:40.157 --> 20:41.975
There.
Right there.

20:51.263 --> 20:54.605
- Go away! I'm on my lunch break.
- Excuse me, officer.

20:54.765 --> 20:56.457
Is this the on-Ramp to 95?

21:01.730 --> 21:02.674
Socks.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.174
I'll be fucked.

21:07.196 --> 21:09.004
This is my partner,
Jimmy McNulty.

21:09.912 --> 21:12.236
You look like a man
in the market for a new house.

21:12.627 --> 21:14.732
Think abouit.
It's a buyer's market.

21:16.464 --> 21:17.463
Nice garden.

21:17.624 --> 21:19.658
Ah, you have an eye
for quality, socks.

21:20.143 --> 21:22.478
Call me if you decide to make a move.

21:25.514 --> 21:26.996
So this isn't a social call?

21:27.156 --> 21:28.468
I wish it were.

21:29.997 --> 21:31.471
Well, get on with it.

21:31.631 --> 21:33.370
I got a busy day tomorrow.
I need my rest.

21:33.529 --> 21:35.236
Oscar, we're in need of a body--

21:35.577 --> 21:38.039
Male, homeless,
little or no decomp.

21:38.199 --> 21:39.461
Unattended death?

21:40.497 --> 21:43.085
That shouldn't be no problem, Socks,
seeing as you homicide.

21:43.246 --> 21:45.838
We need to get to it before anybody else
gets a look-- see.

21:48.396 --> 21:50.092
You want to open an H-file?

21:53.755 --> 21:55.507
Well, that's got to be a first.

22:00.564 --> 22:01.924
How do I reach you?

22:05.296 --> 22:06.775
- All right.
- All right.

22:08.104 --> 22:09.580
You want to know why?

22:14.126 --> 22:15.228
Is that it?

22:17.649 --> 22:18.794
If he backs up on us--

22:18.955 --> 22:20.912
Mcquayle was in homicide.
He caught one--

22:21.072 --> 22:22.307
A botched kidnapping.

22:22.467 --> 22:25.710
He gets there, finds the area
Chief sightseeing through his scene,

22:25.870 --> 22:27.513
asks him to back off,

22:27.674 --> 22:29.527
- cites the G.O.
- G-3:

22:29.758 --> 22:33.133
authority and responsibility to
coordinate the investigation shall rest

22:33.293 --> 22:34.852
with the homicide detective.

22:35.954 --> 22:37.702
Area Chief takes umbrage.

22:37.983 --> 22:40.181
Oscar stands his ground,
and there's quite a dust-up.

22:40.340 --> 22:42.641
The next morning,
he's told he's insubordinate.

22:42.895 --> 22:46.730
He's got to work two weeks extra duty
pounding pavement up Omonument street.

22:47.032 --> 22:50.789
He told them to go fuck themselves,
you know, he'll take the trial board.

22:51.462 --> 22:53.202
Well, he eats two weeks,

22:53.362 --> 22:55.237
and they shitcan him out the unit.

22:56.246 --> 22:57.260
Area Chief?

22:57.895 --> 22:59.824
Name of Rawls,
as I remember it.

23:28.896 --> 23:30.513
How you still alive, yo?

23:32.320 --> 23:35.109
They needed to send a message.
Tell him.

23:35.563 --> 23:38.947
Said, "tell Omar he put
his hand in the wrong pocket."

23:39.108 --> 23:41.073
And you need to know,
Marlo dogs,

23:41.232 --> 23:42.735
they didn't let Butchie go easy.

23:42.895 --> 23:46.521
I'm gonna work them.
Sweet Jesus, I'm gonna work them.

23:47.295 --> 23:49.705
- I want in.
- Nah, this one on me, yo.

23:49.960 --> 23:51.836
But you don't know them people.

24:00.201 --> 24:01.868
As expected, it's Rawls,

24:02.028 --> 24:03.804
with Daniels waiting in the wings.

24:05.028 --> 24:07.348
Did they not know that
I had made myself a candidate?

24:07.507 --> 24:09.309
- I feel dissed.
- So the great white Rawls

24:09.469 --> 24:12.301
- Filly has his day.
- Not much more than a day it shall be.

24:12.462 --> 24:13.646
Daniels by year's end.

24:14.552 --> 24:15.660
Look at this.

24:20.761 --> 24:22.196
You're not even gonna read it?

24:22.895 --> 24:24.434
All you do is change the date.

24:24.649 --> 24:25.867
I'm covering my ass, Jay.

24:26.027 --> 24:27.365
Consider it covered.

24:28.465 --> 24:29.347
Motherfucker,

24:29.831 --> 24:32.369
I am the primary
on 22 bodies more than a year old,

24:32.529 --> 24:34.854
and I still haven't got
trace analysis on 14 scenes.

24:35.015 --> 24:37.235
The lab can't keep up
with this year's cases.

24:37.527 --> 24:39.654
You want action,
show me some traction.

24:40.373 --> 24:42.357
Or buy yourself a chemistry set.

24:52.393 --> 24:54.016
Just doing background on my vics,

24:54.177 --> 24:55.435
Looking for a coon thread.

24:55.595 --> 24:57.094
Motherfucker, don't even--

24:58.366 --> 25:00.176
Fuck you, too, motherfucker.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.611
- What's wrong with Bunk?
- Hard to say.

25:05.166 --> 25:07.614
Beneath that gruff veneer,
he's actually very emotional.

25:09.061 --> 25:11.966
Looking for the theme
in your homeless case, are you?

25:12.827 --> 25:14.278
Well, wish me luck.

25:14.683 --> 25:17.201
I'm gonna try for an interview
with my only wit.

25:17.361 --> 25:18.842
The home invasion?

25:32.964 --> 25:35.827
Fuck him, Tony. The guy was an asshole.
He saw what you've been doing.

25:35.987 --> 25:38.033
You know who you were
beating on yesterday?

25:38.194 --> 25:39.557
You fucking know?

25:40.261 --> 25:42.939
A teacher,
from stuart hill elementary,

25:43.194 --> 25:45.935
trying to get around our bullshit
to make it to an after-school program.

25:46.094 --> 25:48.643
- He should have said so.
- He never got a chance.

25:51.361 --> 25:53.460
Boy, I seen some stupid shit in my day,

25:53.620 --> 25:56.766
but even by western standards,
this rates a whole new category.

25:56.987 --> 25:59.016
I.I.D. Is down the hall
talking to the Major.

25:59.176 --> 26:02.143
They're gonna be down here
looking for statements in 10 minutes.

26:03.306 --> 26:05.333
Tony, you got to write this smart.

26:06.254 --> 26:08.115
The excessive horn blowing
distracted you

26:08.275 --> 26:10.326
from securing juvenile prisoners who...

26:10.486 --> 26:12.258
became volatile due to the noise,

26:12.960 --> 26:14.859
And you warned the driver
several times--

26:15.244 --> 26:16.456
Fuck that motherfucker.

26:17.027 --> 26:18.810
- Say what?
- I said, fuck him.

26:19.122 --> 26:21.154
Shitbird lays on his horn,
he should be locked up.

26:21.314 --> 26:22.878
Fuck his ignorant ass.

26:24.293 --> 26:25.939
<i>Admin Lieutenant to the Major's office.</i>

26:26.660 --> 26:28.377
<i>Admin lieutenant to the major's office.</i>

26:32.760 --> 26:34.492
Tony, I'm writing you up.

26:37.628 --> 26:39.799
- You ain't gonna back me?
- I'm charging you.

26:40.085 --> 26:42.830
Then charge me.
You're a fucking rat.

26:45.226 --> 26:46.526
Then I'm a rat.

26:54.960 --> 26:57.511
No way. After what I've been through
to toss him out of the plane,

26:57.670 --> 26:59.721
Now you want me to pretty up
the man's parachute?

26:59.881 --> 27:01.899
The commissioner
has served this city for 34 years.

27:02.059 --> 27:04.166
Any 5 of which would be enough
to have him indicted.

27:04.326 --> 27:06.933
You should have thought about this
before you put a gun to my head

27:07.093 --> 27:09.317
and snatched up the McCulloh homes
for whatever developer

27:09.478 --> 27:11.524
- you're hiding in your skirt.
- This isn't about me,

27:11.684 --> 27:13.567
and it isn't even about Burrell.

27:13.726 --> 27:16.904
It's about Daniels or whoever you're
trying to empower in that department.

27:17.064 --> 27:19.323
- How so?
- 34 years is a long time.

27:19.483 --> 27:22.410
Anyone who hangs around that long
can put his hands on a lot of dirt.

27:22.725 --> 27:24.412
- If he'd talk out of turn--
- Daniels?

27:24.839 --> 27:26.559
I'm not being specific here.

27:26.892 --> 27:28.791
I'm just making it clear
for everyone's sake

27:28.951 --> 27:31.043
It would be better
if Burrell went quietly.

27:35.727 --> 27:38.772
We've scheduled a press
conference for this afternoon.

27:39.516 --> 27:42.233
I think Ervin is ready
for a little grip and grin.

27:42.393 --> 27:44.179
With you, with Rawls...

27:44.473 --> 27:47.892
for considerations, he might
even put his arm around Daniels.

27:51.105 --> 27:53.694
Money from a donor
to west side hoops.

27:54.392 --> 27:55.684
Deposit date.

27:56.292 --> 27:58.403
Withdrawal from that account

27:58.562 --> 28:00.160
to his personal account.

28:00.743 --> 28:01.713
Again...

28:02.497 --> 28:03.782
money from a donor.

28:05.818 --> 28:07.693
Thank you for coming, Senator.

28:09.597 --> 28:11.414
We've asked you in to answer

28:11.575 --> 28:13.249
questions regarding certain

28:13.409 --> 28:14.965
financial irregularities.

28:15.245 --> 28:18.212
We can go to my office and talk first
or get right to it.

28:19.165 --> 28:20.200
Lead on.

28:22.603 --> 28:24.256
If you'll follow me, then.

28:34.398 --> 28:36.128
He's pretty cool about it.

28:37.293 --> 28:39.198
The coming out tells the tale.

28:39.759 --> 28:40.708
Devon?

28:41.393 --> 28:42.914
<i>Do you know this story?</i>

28:45.560 --> 28:47.359
<i>Or would you like me
to read it to you?</i>

28:49.225 --> 28:50.173
<i>Devon?</i>

29:00.288 --> 29:05.270
Now, then, I show you a canceled check
dated 22 january, 2007,

29:05.429 --> 29:07.603
from Sterner, Ernst,
and Bauer development group

29:07.763 --> 29:10.456
made payable to west Baltimore
hoops, incorporated

29:10.616 --> 29:12.598
in the amount of $11,000.

29:12.857 --> 29:17.520
And this dated 23 january, 2007,

29:17.791 --> 29:21.298
a check drawn on the west Baltimore
hoops, incorporated account

29:21.459 --> 29:24.276
In the amount of $11,000.
And a deposit slip

29:24.531 --> 29:27.539
dated 23 january, same year,

29:27.698 --> 29:29.281
to your personal account

29:29.440 --> 29:31.367
in the amount of $11,000.

29:36.292 --> 29:39.456
I come here to help,
but y'all out for blood.

29:40.868 --> 29:43.043
I'm not answering no more questions.

29:43.870 --> 29:46.297
You are invoking your right
against self-Incrimination,

29:46.457 --> 29:47.841
- sir?
- Damn right.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.461
Then we'll conclude this testimony.

30:12.559 --> 30:13.384
Damn.

30:13.949 --> 30:15.731
And that was just a love tap.

30:15.891 --> 30:19.862
Think what'd have happened if we hit
the good Senator with the whole shebang.

30:22.724 --> 30:24.099
Work on the fifth, huh?

30:24.831 --> 30:26.557
Why did we even grand jury, then?

30:26.723 --> 30:30.006
The answer to at, detective,
is out on Calvert street.

30:30.166 --> 30:32.257
Senator. Senator,
we'd like to talk to you.

30:32.418 --> 30:33.466
Please, over here.

30:33.627 --> 30:35.431
Senator, would you care
to make a statement?

30:38.163 --> 30:40.164
Is it true that you appeared
before the grand jury?

30:40.325 --> 30:42.319
Jane, I insisted that I be called.

30:42.791 --> 30:45.383
It's our understanding that
you're the target of an investigation

30:45.543 --> 30:47.769
- into theft and fraud.
- Nooo. Pardon. Nooo.

30:48.861 --> 30:50.817
Some people are confused
about some things.

30:51.124 --> 30:53.570
But that's why I came down here today,
to set them straight.

30:53.857 --> 30:57.023
Happy to do it, too.
Happy to avail myself...

30:57.486 --> 30:59.581
Grand jury's supposed to be secret.

31:00.040 --> 31:02.953
- Who called the reporters?
- Mr. Bond, our state's attorney--

31:03.113 --> 31:05.706
Laying claim to the Senator
before anybody else can.

31:06.005 --> 31:08.637
There just seemed to be
a little bit of a misunderstanding

31:08.796 --> 31:10.897
about some of my dealings
here in the community.

31:11.056 --> 31:13.791
As soon as this newspaper
stink get off my ass,

31:14.041 --> 31:16.530
I'm gonna unload my club
and clear a mil.

31:16.690 --> 31:19.264
And I'm gonna snatch up every vacant
I can get my fat-ass fingers on.

31:19.424 --> 31:21.137
There you go.
Like a real player.

31:21.297 --> 31:23.723
It's a whole new world out there.
Buy you some property.

31:23.884 --> 31:25.763
Hold onto it till
the white people show up,

31:25.923 --> 31:27.763
- You make a killing.
- Milton's into that,

31:27.923 --> 31:31.330
Except he got some kind of deal with
that bullshit prisoner entry program.

31:31.490 --> 31:34.567
- Got convicts fixing up his house.
- Motherfuckers...

31:35.192 --> 31:36.486
shut the fuck up.

31:37.692 --> 31:39.763
I'm sick of listening to your shit.

31:40.817 --> 31:42.950
Have we got business?
If we ain't, we gonna bounce.

31:43.881 --> 31:45.931
Marlo here seems pressed for time.

31:46.367 --> 31:49.197
So y'all can pick back up
on this after the meeting.

31:49.357 --> 31:50.415
Last up.

31:50.888 --> 31:53.085
- We got hungry man.
- Junior here

31:53.245 --> 31:55.586
took it upon himself
to make unlawful incursions

31:55.746 --> 31:57.896
into county territory
that was marked for my people.

31:58.056 --> 32:00.592
Incursions?
Ain't you the articulate motherfucker?

32:00.752 --> 32:02.594
Keep on talking, boy.
You gonna get spanked.

32:02.754 --> 32:05.222
Like you got the heart.
Motherfucker piss like a bitch.

32:05.382 --> 32:06.874
All right, shut it down.

32:09.280 --> 32:11.185
Last I look,
you wasn't no charter member.

32:13.557 --> 32:14.759
I apologize.

32:15.390 --> 32:18.860
My nephew gonna heed
the boundaries, I assure you.

32:19.541 --> 32:21.862
A'ight.
Meeting's adjourned.

32:28.694 --> 32:30.325
What the fuck up in here?

32:36.373 --> 32:37.961
Just like I told you, right?

32:38.547 --> 32:40.798
I pulled some of it out,
brought it back home.

32:41.290 --> 32:42.253
I was, uh--

32:42.631 --> 32:43.816
I was thinking.

32:45.323 --> 32:46.712
What next with this?

32:48.923 --> 32:50.966
You clear some time tomorrow,

32:51.918 --> 32:54.226
I'll open the door for you.
That work?

32:55.563 --> 32:56.271
Son...

32:57.389 --> 33:02.099
you need to focus a bit more on what
can be gained by working with people.

33:02.430 --> 33:04.215
That's just a thought, now.

33:05.236 --> 33:06.988
Yeah. Thanks.

33:23.762 --> 33:25.757
Come to see a dead man walking?

33:28.756 --> 33:31.313
I hear Carcetti's gonna do right by you.

33:31.688 --> 33:34.696
Salary with the coordinating council,
then a D.C. job.

33:35.788 --> 33:38.561
- You deserve it.
- Sure, I deserve it,

33:38.721 --> 33:40.417
but not for doing the job.

33:41.422 --> 33:42.439
What I got,

33:42.650 --> 33:45.707
they gave me for carrying
their water all these years.

33:46.229 --> 33:47.784
To Carcetti, I'm a hack.

33:48.156 --> 33:49.702
Royce was no different.

33:51.268 --> 33:52.241
Maybe I am.

33:52.530 --> 33:55.262
But every day, they send over
a new priority.

33:55.612 --> 33:58.228
Go after the bad guys.
No, change that.

33:58.793 --> 34:01.017
Make quality-of-life cases.

34:01.178 --> 34:02.562
Get on top of the murders.

34:02.721 --> 34:07.010
On second thought,
run thewhores out of Patterson park.

34:07.421 --> 34:11.541
You think the mayor
tells the schools how to teach kids,

34:11.920 --> 34:13.728
or the health department
how to do its job,

34:13.889 --> 34:15.610
or sanitation how to pick up trash?

34:15.768 --> 34:20.292
But get elected, and suddenly,
they know police work.

34:21.989 --> 34:23.770
You might think it'll be different

34:25.136 --> 34:26.467
when you sit here,

34:27.539 --> 34:28.565
but it won't.

34:29.188 --> 34:31.217
You will eat their shit.

34:32.210 --> 34:34.580
Daniels, too, when he gets here.

34:51.721 --> 34:53.842
<i>I wonder how you get
the ladder to go up.</i>

34:54.255 --> 34:55.639
<i>How do you do that?</i>

34:58.755 --> 35:00.634
<i>This is a wonderful fire truck.</i>

35:01.831 --> 35:03.980
<i>I wonder where all the firemen are.</i>

35:05.646 --> 35:07.465
<i>Think they could fit in here?</i>

35:08.991 --> 35:11.294
<i>I wonder what kind of siren
sound this makes.</i>

35:12.278 --> 35:13.490
Cheryl, hey.

35:15.369 --> 35:19.366
I was thinking I might want
to swing by and see Elijah, you know?

35:21.612 --> 35:24.066
Yeah, I know it's been a while.
But...

35:25.558 --> 35:27.245
No, no, no. I can get off.

35:27.686 --> 35:29.420
Yeah, tomorrow'd be fine.

35:32.410 --> 35:33.798
Yeah. Sure.

35:34.320 --> 35:35.670
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

35:38.755 --> 35:41.378
- I'm sorry. I just don't think--
- No, no. It's OK.

35:41.538 --> 35:43.847
Right now, he's too withdrawn
to revisit the event.

35:46.421 --> 35:48.989
How do you come back
from something like that?

35:59.155 --> 36:00.865
You look nervous, deputy.

36:03.088 --> 36:05.037
I swear I didn't ask for this.

36:05.197 --> 36:06.157
Relax.

36:06.751 --> 36:10.414
You once told me that if I was gonna do
you, you'd be done already. Remember?

36:11.729 --> 36:14.502
Shit, I don't even remember
what was in that file.

36:14.661 --> 36:17.102
Something about the eastern district.

36:17.988 --> 36:20.602
So long ago, who can remember?

36:30.769 --> 36:33.102
I wanted to say a few words
about public service

36:33.515 --> 36:35.420
And about Ervin h. Burrell.

36:37.051 --> 36:39.085
During my time on the city council,

36:39.653 --> 36:40.944
Erv was no stranger to me.

36:41.103 --> 36:43.033
<i>I chaired the public safety
subcommittee,</i>

36:43.192 --> 36:44.821
<i>and I called upon him many times.</i>

36:44.981 --> 36:47.434
<i>We worked closely together then,
and when I became Mayor,</i>

36:47.594 --> 36:49.158
<i>we formed a strong relationship...</i>

36:49.319 --> 36:51.954
he feared and hated me,
and I merely wanted him dead.

36:53.105 --> 36:54.760
<i>... making Baltimore a safer city.</i>

36:54.920 --> 36:57.001
Don't stray from the inner harbor.

36:59.378 --> 37:02.842
<i>I know that the criminal justice
coordinating council need a new...</i>

37:03.002 --> 37:06.051
it took a while, but I finally
put his ass out to pasture.

37:07.293 --> 37:08.427
<i>If you would.</i>

37:09.388 --> 37:11.295
<i>Thank you.
I have a plaque for you.</i>

37:11.455 --> 37:12.808
Plaques for hacks.

37:13.021 --> 37:14.761
Prerogative of any big-city Mayor.

37:16.411 --> 37:19.330
How much of that insight and analysis
can we get in tomorrow's story?

37:20.057 --> 37:21.258
Little to none.

37:22.784 --> 37:24.952
Twigg was the man who could work
the department sources,

37:25.112 --> 37:27.856
and they're the ones that would shit
all over a dog-and-pony show like that.

37:28.016 --> 37:29.365
What about Price at the hall?

37:29.525 --> 37:31.093
They set up the press conference.

37:31.253 --> 37:33.378
They're not gonna tell the
truth, even on background.

37:33.537 --> 37:36.787
A veteran in the cop shop is what
gets us over on a story like this,

37:36.947 --> 37:39.186
and fuck if we didn't buy ours out.

37:39.493 --> 37:42.554
Gus, I understand that you're
disappointed with the cutbacks,

37:42.714 --> 37:44.211
But civility is important.

37:44.766 --> 37:46.919
I've been meaning to talk to you
about your profanity.

37:47.080 --> 37:48.341
My profanity?

37:48.852 --> 37:50.844
A collegial atmosphere is essential.

37:57.593 --> 37:58.715
Collegial?

37:59.073 --> 38:02.021
I failed out of journalism school.
What the fuck do "collegial" mean?

38:02.351 --> 38:04.357
Jesus Christ.
We don't have this?

38:04.725 --> 38:08.225
<i>Prosecutors would not comment on
a possible grand jury investigation,</i>

38:08.385 --> 38:09.993
but sources familiar with the case

38:10.154 --> 38:12.127
<i>say the Senator
has been under investigation</i>

38:12.288 --> 38:13.782
<i>- for more than a year.
- Sorze.</i>

38:16.797 --> 38:18.495
Clay Davis was grand-juried today.

38:18.654 --> 38:20.888
He's been under investigation
for almost a year.

38:21.048 --> 38:22.687
I'm a federal court reporter, remember?

38:22.848 --> 38:25.032
We haven't had daily city court covere
since Doug Strock

38:25.192 --> 38:27.545
- took the buyout before last.
- This isn't a federal probe?

38:27.705 --> 38:30.088
If it was, I would have had it
months ago. This is city.

38:30.248 --> 38:32.174
You want one reporter
covering two courthouses,

38:32.334 --> 38:34.465
fine. Why don't you
shove the broom up my ass,

38:34.626 --> 38:36.010
and I'll sweep the floor.

38:36.169 --> 38:37.726
All right. Just get caught up, OK?

38:37.886 --> 38:39.974
Meanwhile, see if you can
get a quote from Davis.

38:40.134 --> 38:42.309
You're chasing
a courthouse story with Sorze.

38:42.470 --> 38:44.811
- No problem. What do you need?
- Find the state's attorney.

38:44.971 --> 38:47.926
He set up a perp walk for Clay Davis
outside the grand jury today.

38:48.086 --> 38:50.525
We get a hold of bond,
he'll catch us up on all this shit.

38:52.219 --> 38:53.126
Jesus.

38:53.285 --> 38:55.238
You remember in the good old days
when nobody

38:55.399 --> 38:57.249
in their right mind
would stage a perp walk

38:57.410 --> 38:59.422
without calling a daily newspaper?

39:00.441 --> 39:03.185
Nowadays, all they care about
is a goddamn video.

39:05.652 --> 39:06.986
They've forgotten.

39:07.145 --> 39:08.818
I don't even know
why we're doing this.

39:08.978 --> 39:11.219
I can knock out an office report
like this in my sleep.

39:11.379 --> 39:15.090
There's no way Jay gets off his fat ass,
comes up to check what I'm doing.

39:15.251 --> 39:16.658
A lot rides on this.

39:16.818 --> 39:19.461
Work it like a real case,
it'll feel like a real case,

39:19.620 --> 39:22.159
And more importantly,
it'll read like a real case.

39:22.319 --> 39:24.419
You should have seen me
in the squad room today.

39:24.579 --> 39:27.285
All the case work laid out
like I'm lost in a career case.

39:27.444 --> 39:29.707
- Landsman barely noticed.
- We crank this up,

39:29.867 --> 39:32.524
Landsman's not the only one who's
gonna be thumbing through this H-file.

39:33.288 --> 39:35.944
We get sloppy, we get cuffed.

39:38.301 --> 39:39.993
What do you want me to do?

39:40.264 --> 39:42.677
What detectives do, detective.

40:01.272 --> 40:03.212
Can I talk to you for a second?

40:03.812 --> 40:06.865
Maybe later.
I got to get readyor work.

40:22.730 --> 40:23.998
Does your dog bite?

40:24.351 --> 40:25.727
Got teeth, don't he?

40:26.785 --> 40:28.851
Chip change, get your ass in here.
That's it.

40:29.805 --> 40:32.025
I'm detective McNulty,
Homicide.

40:32.185 --> 40:33.879
May I ask you a few questions?

40:34.716 --> 40:35.807
Got a card?

40:40.185 --> 40:41.402
You got a card?

40:43.246 --> 40:44.988
- Card?
- Business card, yeah.

40:45.956 --> 40:48.017
I can't make no money like that...

41:01.618 --> 41:02.863
This-- That.

41:03.085 --> 41:04.275
That is a card.

41:23.270 --> 41:24.338
We having fun yet?

41:27.571 --> 41:28.739
I need a drink.

41:47.703 --> 41:50.413
I'm gonna ask you once,
where Joe?

41:51.117 --> 41:52.620
Skip past the talking.

41:53.484 --> 41:54.768
Do what you feel.

41:56.001 --> 41:57.497
Joe ain't had nothing to do with--

41:59.543 --> 42:01.890
Now, Slim, you gonna make me
hurt you, yo.

42:02.169 --> 42:03.510
Ask yourself, dog,

42:03.671 --> 42:05.529
why would Joe give Butchie up?

42:08.565 --> 42:10.349
If Marlo could make him talk,

42:10.784 --> 42:13.094
he puts Joe inside your big score.

42:13.717 --> 42:16.680
If Joe turned Butchie,
I'd tell you.

42:17.482 --> 42:19.357
Shit, I help you, even.

42:20.016 --> 42:21.562
But it just ain't like that.

42:23.717 --> 42:24.683
Come on, yo.

42:28.150 --> 42:29.158
Finish it.

42:56.545 --> 42:58.405
Take a look at the fifth graph.

42:58.904 --> 43:02.924
"The Mayor, comma, incensed by
the commissioner's performance..."

43:03.227 --> 43:05.269
- "Incensed" seems over the top.
- I don't know.

43:05.508 --> 43:08.662
Drug legalization fiasco,
the bodies in the vacants,

43:09.015 --> 43:11.317
The bullshit stats.
I'd be incensed.

43:14.270 --> 43:16.412
Take a look at Arnold's fifth graph.

43:16.816 --> 43:17.544
OK.

43:18.963 --> 43:21.324
"Incensed" is to inflame with wrath.

43:21.612 --> 43:25.038
It speaks to obsession.
Is this the Mayor's state of mind?

43:25.283 --> 43:27.123
Something more nuanced, perhaps.

43:27.326 --> 43:29.083
Galled, vexed, annoyed...

43:29.244 --> 43:31.336
safer still--Displeased.

43:31.912 --> 43:33.609
You'd take the crab
out of crab soup.

43:37.748 --> 43:38.855
Hey, Scott,

43:39.015 --> 43:41.456
That was good work by you
and sorze catching us up.

43:41.792 --> 43:44.390
- Great effort.
- There's an "attaboy" for you.

43:45.971 --> 43:47.646
How'd it go in washington?

43:48.945 --> 43:50.741
Eh, buyer's market out there.

43:51.216 --> 43:52.196
Metro desk.

43:54.765 --> 43:56.616
"Baltimore Sun" ain't so bad.

43:58.046 --> 43:59.403
<i>9-Adam-4-3.</i>

44:00.150 --> 44:00.934
<i>43.</i>

44:01.681 --> 44:05.241
<i>Reported D.O.A. alley
in the rear of the old plant.</i>

44:05.902 --> 44:06.927
<i>Copy d.O.A.</i>

44:07.903 --> 44:09.822
9-46.
K-G-A,

44:09.983 --> 44:12.422
Advise 43 I'm close by.
I'll handle it.

44:12.583 --> 44:14.296
<i>Copy, 9-Adam-46.</i>

44:15.481 --> 44:17.476
Bunk, are you feeling all right?

44:17.995 --> 44:20.309
She said "D.O.A.," not "doughnut."

44:41.349 --> 44:44.357
I know y'all into keeping
things on the hush-hush tip,

44:44.517 --> 44:45.656
But, damn, Chris,

44:45.983 --> 44:48.140
This C.I.A. shit off the hook.

44:49.894 --> 44:50.732
I, uh...

44:51.782 --> 44:54.653
I ain't done nothing lately
to piss you off, right?

44:56.350 --> 44:57.243
Right?

45:04.715 --> 45:06.554
Man already shit hisself,

45:06.875 --> 45:08.880
And we ain't even get started t.

45:09.349 --> 45:10.889
He's funky, yo.

45:11.616 --> 45:12.850
It's a gift from Marlo.

45:13.168 --> 45:14.656
But you know how that go.

45:14.816 --> 45:16.889
Give a gift, get a gift.

45:21.249 --> 45:23.336
Yo, hungry man, what's up?

45:34.858 --> 45:36.488
Lester, you can turn around.

45:37.437 --> 45:38.837
Yeah, false alarm.

45:41.270 --> 45:43.688
- Won't work. He's too far gone.
- I find them, detective.

45:43.848 --> 45:45.922
What you do after that
is your business.

45:46.156 --> 45:47.743
Thanks. Maybe next time.

45:48.397 --> 45:50.888
Seeing as how I'm doing you
a favor, detective,

45:51.253 --> 45:53.909
You can write the first
officer's report for me.

45:57.815 --> 45:59.776
My sequence is a-1-15.

46:12.281 --> 46:14.495
I know him.
Avon's lawyer.

46:14.809 --> 46:16.010
Yeah, mine, too.

46:16.481 --> 46:17.688
Brick uses him.

46:18.123 --> 46:21.810
So does Phil boy for most of his stuff,
not just the criminal side.

46:22.454 --> 46:25.925
Yeah, Levy excels in putting
our limp-dick money to work.

46:26.649 --> 46:28.996
You want to know what to do
with them bank checks?

46:29.157 --> 46:30.881
This where you need to be.

46:32.669 --> 46:34.987
Joseph, you're looking prosperous.

46:35.214 --> 46:36.163
I get by.

46:37.080 --> 46:38.098
Mr. Stanfield.

46:38.596 --> 46:40.558
Joseph tells me
good things about you.

46:42.515 --> 46:43.853
You ever find that camera?

46:45.314 --> 46:46.317
Cost me the job.

46:48.582 --> 46:51.527
So let's, go into the conference room
where we can spread out.

46:55.714 --> 46:58.461
This between you
and your attorney.

47:19.365 --> 47:21.392
Carcetti finally dumps Burrell.

47:22.448 --> 47:25.143
Ervin was a year before me at dunbar.

47:26.548 --> 47:27.472
No shit.

47:29.125 --> 47:30.723
He was in the glee club.

47:34.147 --> 47:35.652
You're killing me.
I got to ask.

47:35.812 --> 47:36.862
Stone stupid.

47:44.948 --> 47:46.122
Say hi to aunt Kima.

47:52.281 --> 47:54.481
Anyways, you were
right on time with this.

47:54.647 --> 47:56.621
I got a dozen things
I got to get done,

47:56.781 --> 47:59.425
and I got to do them while
working overtime at the station.

47:59.741 --> 48:00.852
Been busy, huh?

48:01.211 --> 48:03.554
Your boss got fired,
and we've been running ever since.

48:05.577 --> 48:06.602
Bye, Lij.

48:07.829 --> 48:09.436
Go on. We'll be fine.

48:18.679 --> 48:20.109
Wow, that's good.

48:20.745 --> 48:22.488
You staying inside the lines.

48:27.679 --> 48:28.870
Want to do something?

48:30.680 --> 48:31.875
Go to the park?

48:33.381 --> 48:34.712
Get some ice cream?

48:41.866 --> 48:42.967
What did you say?

48:45.213 --> 48:46.752
You don't have a house?

48:47.822 --> 48:48.987
What's up with that?

48:49.283 --> 48:50.599
A hero needs a house.

48:56.357 --> 48:58.232
Been a long time
since I built a house.

48:59.935 --> 49:01.109
Hope I remember how.

49:32.812 --> 49:33.863
Deputy ops.

49:35.482 --> 49:37.972
Nothis is Daniels.
Cedric Daniels.

49:40.248 --> 49:42.190
He's now in the commiioner's office.

49:43.346 --> 49:44.052
Yes.

50:02.379 --> 50:04.891
He knows he fucked up.
He knows this.

50:06.078 --> 50:08.602
He's proud, you know?
He doesn't want to beg.

50:09.845 --> 50:11.270
It's not about that.

50:11.897 --> 50:13.054
Come on, Carv.

50:13.712 --> 50:15.722
You cannot do one of your own guys.

50:16.711 --> 50:18.952
I know you got rank now.
You're damn near lieutenant.

50:19.112 --> 50:20.169
But still...

50:22.441 --> 50:24.071
It ain't about the rank.

50:28.527 --> 50:30.060
I never told you, Herc.

50:32.185 --> 50:33.849
Never said a fucking word.

50:35.176 --> 50:37.252
But when I gave you that kid
to debrief last year,

50:37.411 --> 50:38.784
what's-his-face?

50:38.945 --> 50:42.343
You were supposed to get him
to Bunk Moreland. You remember that?

50:42.745 --> 50:45.843
Yeah. I fucked up.
So what?

50:47.312 --> 50:48.712
So it mattered.

50:49.677 --> 50:51.924
So what the fuck does this
have to do with Colicchio?

50:52.212 --> 50:53.532
It all matters.

50:54.623 --> 50:56.717
I know we thought it didn't, but...

50:58.977 --> 51:00.003
it does.

51:04.046 --> 51:06.014
So you got to do Colicchio, huh?

51:07.512 --> 51:09.506
Guess you think they had to do me.

51:13.397 --> 51:14.642
Yeah, probably.

51:18.600 --> 51:21.418
These guys are gonna talk shit
about you for a while.

51:21.579 --> 51:22.917
But fuck 'em, Carv.

51:23.312 --> 51:24.746
You do what needs done.

52:08.771 --> 52:11.572
- I was out all morning.
- You worked 8:00 to 4:00.

52:12.545 --> 52:15.317
I'm working a serial killer.
They call me on any suspicious death.

52:15.581 --> 52:17.421
Yeah? Where'd they reach you?

52:19.644 --> 52:21.080
Well, I'm not gonna lie.

52:21.356 --> 52:23.245
I stopped, had a couple,
then I got the call.

52:23.405 --> 52:25.901
I know. I can smell
the Jameson's from here.

52:26.811 --> 52:28.956
- Jamie and listerine-- Your scent.
- Beadie...

52:30.332 --> 52:32.111
- I'm just--
- We had something, Jimmy.

52:32.305 --> 52:34.738
You and me,
we had something.

52:36.815 --> 52:38.591
You know, when people told me

52:38.750 --> 52:42.279
stories about you, about how you were,
I couldn't believe it.

52:43.078 --> 52:44.401
I couldn't see it.

53:04.177 --> 53:05.521
Yeah. 10 minutes.

53:06.771 --> 53:08.941
I got another one.
South Baltimore.

53:13.831 --> 53:17.188
- Beadie, I'm chasing a serial killer.
- Yeah. That's not all you're chasing.

53:19.877 --> 53:22.151
Look. If you don't want to be here...

53:23.878 --> 53:25.244
I got to go.

53:30.043 --> 53:31.232
He changed up.

53:32.477 --> 53:35.788
Marlo's no fool.
He know you be coming at him.

53:36.025 --> 53:38.085
Word is, him and Chris
went to the mattresses,

53:38.244 --> 53:40.043
on the move almost every night.

53:40.203 --> 53:41.717
Fool enough to kick a sleeping dog.

53:41.877 --> 53:44.783
- That should tell you something, no?
- While I got the boy waiting on me,

53:44.943 --> 53:46.616
I ain't go at him straight up.

53:46.952 --> 53:48.727
I go after his people, you feel me?

53:48.887 --> 53:52.266
You hurt enough of them, that snake
gonna stick his head above that hole.

53:53.410 --> 53:54.559
That one there?

53:55.583 --> 53:58.249
He's a lieutenant.
We gonna go after him first.

53:59.893 --> 54:01.271
Mark that ride, yo.

54:02.710 --> 54:03.612
Oscar.

54:04.977 --> 54:05.910
Lester.

54:06.077 --> 54:08.063
- Thank you, baby.
- Yeah. Anytime, man.

54:16.176 --> 54:17.119
He's perfect.

54:17.279 --> 54:19.214
Can't be dead
more than a couple of hours.

54:19.573 --> 54:20.855
Better lose these.

54:29.544 --> 54:31.683
You're a twisted fuck, McNulty.

54:31.943 --> 54:33.749
Defense wounds.
Help sell it.

54:34.839 --> 54:36.722
You got a lot of nerve
calling me twisted.

54:36.881 --> 54:39.216
You're the fella
that came up with the teeth.

54:39.376 --> 54:41.857
You know how these psycho
serial motherfuckers are.

54:42.017 --> 54:43.295
They mature.

54:44.116 --> 54:46.147
They start simple and crude

54:46.710 --> 54:49.317
And become more and more ornate.

54:49.478 --> 54:50.403
There you are.

54:50.563 --> 54:52.778
Don't ever tell my mother
or my priest you saw me do this.

54:52.939 --> 54:54.280
Take it to my grave.

55:06.108 --> 55:08.418
- Want me to take that?
- Nah, I got it.

55:10.932 --> 55:12.649
What you see in this hole, man?

55:12.809 --> 55:14.347
All the money you got?

55:16.476 --> 55:17.760
Your great-grandfather,

55:18.672 --> 55:21.973
First colored man to own
his own house in Johnson square.

55:22.842 --> 55:24.330
That means something,

55:25.217 --> 55:26.853
Something you young'uns lost.

55:28.176 --> 55:30.316
Well, we outside when you ready.

55:30.656 --> 55:32.516
Hey, keep sharp while I'm gone, boy.

55:32.675 --> 55:34.084
Charles say Omar back,

55:34.243 --> 55:35.835
and while he left Charles standing,

55:35.995 --> 55:39.157
the man might feel less inclined
if he get the drop on you or yours.

55:39.872 --> 55:41.976
Ain't got to fret none about Omar.

55:49.216 --> 55:50.542
No need for that.

56:01.560 --> 56:03.345
You ain't come to see me off.

56:08.041 --> 56:09.101
My nephew.

56:13.709 --> 56:15.615
Boy was always a disappointment.

56:18.263 --> 56:19.695
But I treated you like a son.

56:20.542 --> 56:22.283
I wasn't made to play the son.

56:22.443 --> 56:24.303
But my supply--
The good dope?

56:24.462 --> 56:26.627
The Greeks, they cool with it.

56:32.175 --> 56:33.493
Proposition, then:

56:35.443 --> 56:37.102
I just step out the way.

56:38.521 --> 56:41.315
You never hear from me again.
I just disappear.

56:42.377 --> 56:44.386
You'd be up into mischief in no time.

56:45.428 --> 56:48.180
Truth is, you wouldn't be able
to change up any more than me.

56:51.441 --> 56:52.768
Close your eyes.

56:55.741 --> 56:57.093
It won't hurt none.

56:59.689 --> 57:01.088
There. There, now.

57:03.442 --> 57:04.924
Joe, relax.

57:07.536 --> 57:08.792
Breathe easy.
