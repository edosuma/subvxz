00:45.712 --> 00:48.625
Why don't you sniff the wind
while you're at it?

00:58.141 --> 01:00.007
Come on.

01:01.103 --> 01:03.971
I guess I'm just itching to get there.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.938
OK.

01:08.860 --> 01:10.692
Let's go.

01:25.544 --> 01:28.207
Hyah!

03:05.477 --> 03:07.343
Ready... fire!

03:09.189 --> 03:11.647
Ready... fire!

03:13.735 --> 03:16.523
Half left... face!

03:18.448 --> 03:21.407
Present... arms.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.493
We was the lucky ones, Frank.

04:12.627 --> 04:15.711
I thought we was gonna
come back that way.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.168
Order... arms!

04:19.301 --> 04:21.839
We're sure sorry about your boy.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.053
Left... face!

04:24.181 --> 04:28.221
- He gave his life for his country, Jake.
- Forward... march!

04:40.864 --> 04:42.947
Mr Ewing.

05:24.699 --> 05:26.941
Well, we need us a new fence.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.613
Gotta get a gate.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.828
We'll be all right.

05:38.296 --> 05:40.913
Cabin ain't much, you know?

05:42.634 --> 05:46.469
Well, imagine.
Weren't even supposed to be a cabin.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.679
There ain't.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.800
- Come on. Ho!
- Hyah, cattle!

05:58.942 --> 06:01.559
Hyah! Yah! Come on, y'all.

06:05.156 --> 06:07.443
You're sure right
about this place, Frank.

06:07.576 --> 06:10.614
I ain't never seen such a pretty place.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.096
Door was open.

07:14.809 --> 07:17.017
Helped myself.

07:25.987 --> 07:28.855
Always did have
the best water in the basin.

07:31.660 --> 07:34.323
Saw the old clock was gone.

07:37.207 --> 07:40.575
Suppose you sold it like you did
that land to them soldier boys.

07:43.630 --> 07:46.213
Ain't you done enough to spite me?

07:50.512 --> 07:53.300
Down to the two of us now.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.599
Just us.

08:01.022 --> 08:03.309
You should've married me.

08:04.359 --> 08:06.442
We'd have had a child.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.733
Be heir to it all.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.527
The whole basin.

08:18.248 --> 08:19.739
Ain't too late.

08:44.774 --> 08:46.231
I gotta hand it to you.

08:47.235 --> 08:51.149
You hung on longer than anybody else.
You put up a hell of a fight.

08:52.741 --> 08:57.236
But it don't take no genius
to see it's your last year.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.345
I don't wanna have to ruin you, Ella.

09:46.878 --> 09:48.790
Jacob?

09:48.922 --> 09:51.915
Do you mind some company?
I've got a call in to Claire.

09:53.468 --> 09:55.084
Did you see this?

09:55.220 --> 09:58.463
I think the Russians
are going to beat us into Berlin.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.555
Neil...

10:00.683 --> 10:03.175
by fall I'll have the Connors' place.

10:05.563 --> 10:08.431
Do you really think
Ella's gonna go under?

10:08.566 --> 10:10.649
You can bet on it.

10:12.237 --> 10:14.820
Why don't you come back east with me
for a couple of weeks?

10:14.948 --> 10:18.191
We'll go down to the place in Virginia
and do some fishing.

10:22.622 --> 10:26.707
I wish your father had lived
to see this basin back together again.

10:27.919 --> 10:31.003
I could never have rebuilt it
without his help.

10:33.883 --> 10:36.045
Well, my father...

10:37.262 --> 10:39.219
was a very generous man.

10:39.347 --> 10:42.966
Cattle will cover this basin the way
buffalo did in my grandfather's time.

10:44.310 --> 10:47.428
Sounds like that might take
a good deal of capital.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.940
This is not a very good time
to talk about it,

10:51.067 --> 10:53.901
but sometime soon I'd like
to sit down with you and talk about

10:54.028 --> 10:56.862
the mineral rights to this valley.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.731
Oil and cattle are not incompatible.

10:58.867 --> 11:01.905
This is heartland. Cattle country.

11:03.413 --> 11:06.156
That's the way it's going to stay.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.749
That's probably Claire.
I'll get it.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.334
Hello?

11:11.462 --> 11:13.499
Yes, I did.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.874
Hi, Claire.

11:19.262 --> 11:21.379
I know it's late in New York,
I'm sorry to wake you,

11:21.514 --> 11:23.847
but I wanted you to know
where things stand.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.816
Who's that benefiting?

11:35.028 --> 11:37.645
Oh well,
if it's the Belgian Red Cross, yes.

20:40.906 --> 20:45.446
each year I get a little less prime,
but I can still do my work.

20:46.454 --> 20:48.571
You ought to know that.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.247
They're saying it's my last year, Dodger.

20:57.339 --> 21:00.047
They're saying
I'm gonna go under before fall.

21:00.843 --> 21:04.382
Aw, they said that before,
if I remember right.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.928
It's different.

21:09.477 --> 21:13.096
This bank isn't gonna let me
just pay on the interest this year.

21:16.192 --> 21:19.776
We're gonna need beeves
coming to over $12,000 by August.

21:19.904 --> 21:23.648
Hell...
We didn't do 4,000 last year.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.275
Well, we come close.

21:26.410 --> 21:28.572
With all them broken bones of yours?

21:29.288 --> 21:33.407
Well, there was a few accidents.
You had some, too.

21:37.004 --> 21:40.247
You're a year older. You're brittler.

21:41.133 --> 21:44.672
And your cows is older and tougher.

21:44.804 --> 21:48.343
Hell, you've got cattle
ain't ever seen flat land.

21:49.433 --> 21:51.846
You might as well be ranching
a bunch of mountain goats.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.226
Hell, that'll ride him.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.685
You know,
that deep water don't hurt,

22:01.821 --> 22:05.940
but that idea of being drug off the cliff
will kind of get you.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.909
- You can say no.
- Hell, no.

22:10.037 --> 22:12.029
I made my choice.

22:18.504 --> 22:24.501
Well, we got us one old man
and a banshee woman boss.

22:26.011 --> 22:29.220
Feel like a fart in a wind storm. Giddup!

22:53.497 --> 22:55.534
Goddamn!

23:04.466 --> 23:06.583
Well, we lost 'em.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.262
Flushin' cows out of this timber

23:11.390 --> 23:15.304
is like trying to teach an elephant
to use a typewriter.

23:56.393 --> 23:58.259
Howdy.

23:59.229 --> 24:01.562
Hear a terrible thing happened to you.

24:04.568 --> 24:07.561
I think I got the man
that did the shooting.

24:08.781 --> 24:11.068
Oh, you did. He's dead.

24:12.576 --> 24:14.192
Did you get the man that sent him?

24:18.123 --> 24:21.412
You better get that son of a bitch
before I do.

24:21.543 --> 24:24.502
His name... is Ewing.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.747
Better tell him that.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.544
He's the law.

24:30.719 --> 24:33.757
The man you killed worked for me.

24:34.932 --> 24:37.049
I'm Ewing.

24:39.311 --> 24:41.428
Sorry your pard's dead.

24:42.523 --> 24:47.518
Sorry all this had to happen,
but sometimes things just work out that way.

24:51.615 --> 24:55.404
Now, we're disposed to give you the benefit
of the doubt when it comes to murder.

25:01.166 --> 25:05.410
You take that and head someplace
where you've got a chance.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.898
Whoa now, baby.

26:24.208 --> 26:26.575
There you go.

26:26.710 --> 26:28.497
Oh, yeah.

26:28.629 --> 26:31.121
What's the matter with it?

26:31.256 --> 26:33.418
Her mama's dead.

26:34.551 --> 26:36.042
She get to nurse any?

26:37.387 --> 26:39.674
I don't know.

26:43.185 --> 26:45.472
I don't think so.

26:47.648 --> 26:51.813
If it didn't, I don't imagine
you're gonna do her any good.

26:54.113 --> 26:56.696
Nobody asked you.

27:02.621 --> 27:05.659
Yeah. Attagirl.

27:06.708 --> 27:08.995
You're gonna be all right.

27:11.046 --> 27:12.378
Yeah.

27:14.716 --> 27:16.833
Please don't watch me.

27:19.513 --> 27:20.754
Yeah.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.131
Yeah.

28:47.267 --> 28:49.554
I'll do it.

28:50.896 --> 28:55.357
Since you're full able to get around
and fix a meal and all.

28:55.484 --> 28:58.727
I figure you might as well just get going.
Here, I'll do it.

28:59.863 --> 29:04.779
I told you I wasn't running no hospital
and this ain't a hotel either.

29:06.078 --> 29:08.445
Just thought I'd give you a little hand.

29:09.665 --> 29:12.157
I don't need a maid, don't need a cook.

29:16.046 --> 29:18.584
You can get that kind of work in town.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.258
I gotta go in tomorrow anyway.
I'll give you a lift.

29:22.386 --> 29:25.129
Here. I made you these.

29:27.599 --> 29:30.091
I don't need no chaps.

29:30.227 --> 29:33.061
Hell, lady, they sure as hell
ain't gonna fit me.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.835
It's a wonder you've got any flesh
on them legs at all

29:37.859 --> 29:40.317
with them skunk skins you been wearing.

29:45.158 --> 29:46.945
Uh...

29:47.077 --> 29:50.161
I need... I need me a horse.
Think I could buy one?

29:52.499 --> 29:56.163
- It'll cost you.
- Yes, ma'am, I did say I'd buy one.

29:56.295 --> 29:59.754
I don't think there's nothing
I want from you for nothing.

30:19.192 --> 30:21.650
There you go.

30:21.778 --> 30:24.486
You should've chose a gentler horse.

30:26.867 --> 30:29.575
You're too stove up for Parsons.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.287
He'll break you just taking you to town.

30:37.502 --> 30:40.415
Don't want you to fall off here and sue me.

30:40.547 --> 30:42.789
I'll take the risk.

30:43.800 --> 30:46.167
I meant what I said
about taking you to town.

30:46.303 --> 30:48.295
Thank you.
I ain't going to town.

30:53.935 --> 30:57.099
You ain't going back to that toilet
you call a cabin, are you?

30:57.230 --> 30:59.062
Yes, ma'am.

31:04.279 --> 31:05.736
Excuse me.

31:07.991 --> 31:12.452
It seemed to me a person in your situation
might use an able-bodied man.

31:19.795 --> 31:21.411
Thank you.

31:39.564 --> 31:42.272
I guess I could use a hired hand.

31:42.401 --> 31:44.393
Sorry, I ain't no hired hand.

31:44.528 --> 31:47.236
I'll work with you,
but I sure as hell can't work for you.

31:53.620 --> 31:56.112
You do owe me.

31:56.248 --> 31:58.865
You owe me for the care
and the time you spent at my place.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.583
- Excuse me?
- I said you do owe me.

32:01.711 --> 32:04.328
You know, lady, you've got balls
the size of grapefruits.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.295
All right.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.593
I'll work for you a season.

32:15.725 --> 32:19.139
You pay me any way you can at the end.

32:21.148 --> 32:23.014
Except some of it's gotta be in stock.

32:25.068 --> 32:28.687
Of course, any of mine we find,
you help me trap 'em.

32:45.505 --> 32:47.588
It's a deal.

33:02.022 --> 33:04.730
Back... Back.

33:17.829 --> 33:19.411
Why don't you come on in?

33:49.528 --> 33:52.771
I thought you might want
something to eat.

33:52.906 --> 33:54.989
Thank you very much.

33:55.116 --> 33:58.826
- There's no need to thank me.
- Guess I lost my head.

34:01.081 --> 34:04.040
Excuse me,
can I use your sink here?

34:04.167 --> 34:06.204
Help yourself.

34:14.636 --> 34:16.047
You're working too hard.

34:17.304 --> 34:20.672
You'll get yourself tore up.
You're not gonna be fit to work.

34:22.561 --> 34:23.972
A few days ain't gonna hurt me,

34:24.103 --> 34:27.063
but you get yourself stove up,
you might as well pack it in,

34:27.190 --> 34:29.476
get yourself another boss,
cos I don't need no cripple.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.601
The towel's under your hat.

34:36.949 --> 34:39.818
I aim to get this drive done.

34:39.953 --> 34:43.367
It's gonna be a long, hard pull.
You're gonna have to be fit.

34:45.041 --> 34:47.748
Yep. Imagine I can handle it.

34:49.170 --> 34:51.536
I don't count on miracles.

35:33.840 --> 35:36.958
Don't mind me. I'm...
I always eat this way.

35:54.861 --> 35:57.899
Er, do you mind if I do the same thing?

35:58.031 --> 36:00.239
Suit yourself.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.033
Excuse me.

36:33.316 --> 36:35.524
Tragedies of Shakespeare.

36:39.989 --> 36:42.276
Oh, I'm sorry.

36:42.409 --> 36:44.822
I didn't know... I'm sorry.

36:44.953 --> 36:47.115
It's my bills.

36:48.206 --> 36:50.664
That's where I keep my bills.

36:52.085 --> 36:54.293
Appropriate, ain't it?

37:14.983 --> 37:18.602
That paint horse
is gonna make a nice calf horse.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.335
Nice house.

37:37.547 --> 37:43.293
I noticed you had a clean spot
on that wall over there.

37:45.597 --> 37:46.963
Mm.

37:48.016 --> 37:50.429
Used to be a clock.

37:50.560 --> 37:54.019
Great-Grandad gave it
to my mom and dad for their wedding.

37:57.150 --> 37:59.688
Like him, it was a noisy old thing.

38:01.362 --> 38:03.604
Couldn't get a moment's peace.

38:13.792 --> 38:16.284
Well, it sure is peaceful now.

38:46.741 --> 38:49.028
Hyah! Hah!

38:54.624 --> 38:57.958
I got the rest of them
corralled up near the high mesa.

39:01.798 --> 39:05.462
And them broncs of yours
are the smartest I ever seen.

39:05.593 --> 39:08.631
Took me three days,
but I got 'em all gathered.

39:09.597 --> 39:11.680
Hello, Buck.

39:13.476 --> 39:17.220
You got some damn fine horses
for this madness of yours, Ella.

39:17.355 --> 39:21.099
- Got enough?
- I wouldn't be here if we didn't.

39:21.234 --> 39:23.476
Enough if he works with us?

39:24.404 --> 39:26.817
You think you're up to this?

39:26.948 --> 39:29.065
The way he talks, he better be.

39:31.327 --> 39:34.411
Well, you... you look all right.

39:34.539 --> 39:38.749
I just hope you don't go bad on us
when we need you the most.

39:38.877 --> 39:41.369
I try not to make a habit
of going bad on folks, old fella.

39:42.463 --> 39:45.547
My name's Dodger, if you don't mind.

39:48.511 --> 39:51.800
You got a place of your own.
Why do you want to throw in with us?

39:53.182 --> 39:55.265
How did you get so old
being so damn nosy?

39:55.393 --> 39:58.352
Uh... luck and brains, I guess.

39:58.479 --> 40:00.687
You gonna answer the question?

40:01.482 --> 40:03.519
You gonna give me a chew?

40:04.944 --> 40:07.982
Well, you...
you sure picked a lulu.

40:11.618 --> 40:13.575
Thank you.

40:15.705 --> 40:18.163
Just don't take it all.

40:29.135 --> 40:31.502
I think I got you figured.

40:31.638 --> 40:35.348
- Let's get the gear.

You ever been married, Buck?

42:57.408 --> 43:00.151
I don't imagine
I ever been that drunk. You?

43:00.286 --> 43:03.620
No. I went with an old gal
for quite a while.

43:05.208 --> 43:09.828
We was laying in bed one morning
and suddenly she sprung it on me.

43:11.172 --> 43:16.668
She said, "Dodger, don't you think
it's about time that we was getting hitched?"

43:17.720 --> 43:21.304

44:38.843 --> 44:40.960

44:41.095 --> 44:45.681
Take them around the long way,
we lose maybe two to four pounds apiece.

44:47.518 --> 44:50.602
- This is the best way.
- Don't mean a damn to me.

44:50.730 --> 44:53.097
I'll pay passage fees.

44:53.232 --> 44:55.098
Imagine you will.

44:56.736 --> 44:59.604
If you let him cross here,
he's gonna walk all over you.

44:59.739 --> 45:00.900
This is a legal challenge.

45:01.032 --> 45:03.385
I know what I'm talking about.
He tried to do this to my dad.

45:10.374 --> 45:11.410
Thousand.

45:11.542 --> 45:13.909
He's pissing on you, Athearn.

45:18.716 --> 45:20.332
Look like you're halfway through now.

45:23.346 --> 45:25.554
Hyah! Hyah, hyah...!

46:01.926 --> 46:04.088
Athearn.

46:07.890 --> 46:09.847
Thanks.

46:15.106 --> 46:17.473
Appreciate you helping out back there.

46:20.611 --> 46:23.695
Think about working with me, Frank,
not against me.

46:27.868 --> 46:30.781
The only thing I want you to appreciate

46:30.913 --> 46:34.156
is I never want to see you or your cattle
on my land again.

46:34.292 --> 46:36.409
Do you understand that?

46:36.544 --> 46:38.581
Do you understand it?

46:52.059 --> 46:53.550
Hello, Buck.

47:12.955 --> 47:15.413
I'll be back for my things.

47:28.179 --> 47:30.421
Well? What happened?

47:36.354 --> 47:39.438
He was letting Ewing
run his cattle across his land.

47:41.942 --> 47:43.934
Yeah?

47:49.492 --> 47:52.030
I stampeded Ewing's cattle.

47:58.250 --> 48:03.086
JW couldn't have split you two up any more
if he'd have used a broad axe on you.

48:08.219 --> 48:10.336
Can't trust Athearn.

48:13.307 --> 48:15.640
Yeah, he's kinda sneaky all right.

48:15.768 --> 48:19.887
Always talking up like he does
and having common sense.

48:21.524 --> 48:24.016
It's real bad business.

48:43.629 --> 48:47.498
Sure did gather them cows
in a hurry, didn't you?

48:47.633 --> 48:51.422
Oh yeah, we're just hell on wheels,
as you probably know.

48:53.139 --> 48:56.177
Are you still looking for that dog to kick?

49:04.233 --> 49:09.979
Damn, you're the one to jump in
when you don't know the right direction.

49:11.198 --> 49:16.068
But you know, you gotta go back
quite a ways to make this all fit in.

49:16.745 --> 49:21.661
- Guess I'm gonna have to hear this.
- Well, just the important part.

49:21.792 --> 49:24.409
That's all that matters.

49:27.214 --> 49:28.830
Well...

49:28.966 --> 49:33.882
Well, JW Ewing and Tom Connors,
they was...

49:34.013 --> 49:36.676
they was raised like brothers
instead of cousins.

49:38.100 --> 49:40.763
Tom never would give in to JW.

49:41.729 --> 49:46.599
He wouldn't budge one inch on the land,
and he raised Ella as a fighter.

49:47.860 --> 49:53.197
He tried to make her a son
that he needed but he never did have.

49:55.701 --> 49:58.614
She was weaned on war.

49:58.746 --> 50:01.329
She never knew nothing else.

50:02.917 --> 50:06.661
They got a word down in Texas.
Stargazer.

50:08.130 --> 50:11.999
That's an old horse
that's had his bit jerked on real hard

50:12.134 --> 50:17.346
whenever he'd slow up
or look down at the ground.

50:17.473 --> 50:20.887
So to get away from that,
he'd hold his head up

50:21.018 --> 50:24.602
and always kind of look at the sky.

50:28.234 --> 50:29.850
That's Ella.

50:33.697 --> 50:36.656
Something I can do for you?

50:36.784 --> 50:39.401
This here's Ralph Cole.

50:39.537 --> 50:41.494
Ewing has him round the place

50:41.622 --> 50:45.616
to keep them windmills going
with that hot air of his, I think.

50:49.296 --> 50:51.879
I'd sure like to know
why he's on the prowl.

50:53.092 --> 50:55.709
- Emil Kroegh was my buddy.
- Ah.

50:57.054 --> 51:00.513
You know, I understand
why they keep this old windbag around.

51:01.850 --> 51:05.514
The only thing he's good for
is mending fences or sugar titting.

51:05.646 --> 51:08.730
But I heard you were a real cowman.

51:08.857 --> 51:12.521
Shit, you ain't nothing but a paper bat
that couldn't lick his upper lip.

51:14.905 --> 51:18.194
Well, any horse's ass
that'd work for a woman,

51:18.325 --> 51:21.568
he don't deserve nothing better
than road-apple pie.

51:28.544 --> 51:31.503
I guess we know
how Ella's paying you off.

51:37.011 --> 51:39.048
Damn.

51:47.896 --> 51:50.058
Drink your beer, Dodger.

51:59.491 --> 52:01.733
I'm sure sorry, fellas.

52:08.167 --> 52:10.329
He'll cover it.

52:10.461 --> 52:13.078
I say you oughtn't have done that.

52:20.721 --> 52:24.340
Look, you tell your boss
to stay clear of me.

52:25.267 --> 52:27.350
Go on.

53:08.727 --> 53:10.810
Didn't want you sneaking back
for your damn cattle.

53:10.938 --> 53:14.477
I'm obliged.
Where'd you find 'em?

53:18.195 --> 53:20.312
Ain't so hard if you know where to look.

53:22.032 --> 53:23.239
How you doin'?

53:24.993 --> 53:27.451
- Fine.
- Fine.

53:37.923 --> 53:39.789
I can offer you a little water if you like.

53:42.219 --> 53:43.630
We hid your cattle on you.

53:45.055 --> 53:47.968
Figure it'd stretch more work out of you.

53:48.100 --> 53:51.389
- Don't much matter.
- Yes, it does.

53:51.520 --> 53:54.228
Ain't never cheated a man in my life.

53:57.985 --> 54:01.353
Even had you stayed,
we would have given them back to you.

54:01.488 --> 54:03.901
It's all right.
How about the water?

54:04.032 --> 54:05.694
No.

54:07.828 --> 54:09.569
I'm not gonna consider it a debt,

54:09.705 --> 54:12.493
you taking a mouthful of water,
you understand?

54:14.168 --> 54:17.832
Woman, what in the hell
is the matter with you?

54:17.963 --> 54:19.875
Well, what the hell's
that supposed to mean?

54:20.007 --> 54:23.091
It means, what in the hell
is the matter with you?

54:24.720 --> 54:29.556
Why don't you just say what you gotta say
instead of that nonsense about these cattle?

54:29.683 --> 54:32.847
You and the old man can't make it alone.

54:32.978 --> 54:34.514
So you need me.

54:34.646 --> 54:37.480
Well, I figure I need you, too.

54:37.608 --> 54:39.725
Imagine I could make this
work here for a year,

54:39.860 --> 54:43.399
but then I'd have to pack it in,
and I figure...

54:43.530 --> 54:45.522
figure you do, too.

54:46.700 --> 54:50.614
- Sure like to figure, don't you?
- Yes, ma'am. It helps.

54:51.830 --> 54:55.995
Look, I don't want to take over your ranch,
you understand? But I, uh...

54:56.126 --> 54:58.709
I'm not coming back as a hired hand.

55:02.466 --> 55:04.423
I ain't never had no partner.

55:04.551 --> 55:07.294
It's not real hard to figure out why.

55:11.517 --> 55:13.679
For the season.

55:15.312 --> 55:17.770
I guess I'll see you in the morning.

55:21.735 --> 55:24.398
There's one more little thing.

55:25.364 --> 55:28.448
I sure hate the way you say my name,
Athearn, I hate it.

55:28.575 --> 55:31.784
Athearn.
Sounds like you're sneezing.

55:31.912 --> 55:35.656
So I thought maybe we could call each other
by our first names, Frank and Ella.

55:35.791 --> 55:38.249
How's that sound?

55:38.377 --> 55:40.494
- All right.
- Ma'am?

55:41.713 --> 55:44.046
- All right.
- All right what?

55:46.093 --> 55:49.257
All right, Frank.

55:49.388 --> 55:52.256
- Jesus.
- There you go.

55:52.391 --> 55:54.724
See you in the morning.

56:11.827 --> 56:14.444
Hyah! Hyah!

56:20.210 --> 56:23.544
Hyah! Hyah...!

57:31.573 --> 57:34.361
- This what this is for?
- No, by God!

59:20.098 --> 59:21.714
Morning, Ella.

59:21.850 --> 59:23.762
Can you spare a minute?

59:23.894 --> 59:25.851
Come in.

59:25.979 --> 59:29.472
This here's Virg Hoverton,
my banker, Frank.

59:29.608 --> 59:31.975
Guess you know about Frank Athearn.

59:32.110 --> 59:34.818
Good morning, Miss Connors.
Athearn.

59:35.781 --> 59:37.568
Pleasure to meet you, Mr Athearn.

59:38.116 --> 59:40.278
This is Neil Atkinson.

59:40.410 --> 59:42.652
I'm sure you've heard of Atko Oil.

59:42.788 --> 59:46.281
And this is George Bascomb,
his geologist.

59:46.416 --> 59:50.410
Heard you were doing pretty good.
Still got a ways to go, though, huh?

59:50.545 --> 59:52.537
I don't guess you come up here
to talk about that.

59:53.131 --> 59:55.874
You got something to say,
why don't you just say it?

59:57.886 --> 59:59.468
You know, Miss Connors,

59:59.596 --> 01:00:02.589
the characteristics of this valley
are almost identical

01:00:02.724 --> 01:00:05.307
to what we found
in other parts of the state

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:08.473
where there are already
substantial oil fields in production.

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:10.165
There could be a lot of wealth in here.

01:00:10.899 --> 01:00:15.189
Unfortunately, we can't really pinpoint
the exact location of that structure

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.107
without a more complete seismic record.

01:00:17.239 --> 01:00:20.573
What he means, Ella, is,
they want to test for oil.

01:00:21.743 --> 01:00:23.200
I'm not stupid, Virg.

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:26.325
I also ain't interested.
You ought to know that by now.

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:28.698
Well, I understand that.

01:00:28.834 --> 01:00:31.622
But have you given any thought
to what this means?

01:00:31.753 --> 01:00:33.119
Well...

01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:37.415
Hell, I imagine it means
you're gonna tear the earth apart.

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:42.962
You know, Ella, I admire you.

01:00:44.933 --> 01:00:50.975
I've watched you and your father
give everything you had to this piece of land.

01:00:51.106 --> 01:00:52.597
Now's your chance to make it pay.

01:00:52.732 --> 01:00:55.520
I seen places where they drill for oil.

01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:03.358
You better include my partner over there
in these dealings. He's got a mind of his own.

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:06.827
It's not just a question of a piece of land
or an oil company.

01:01:06.955 --> 01:01:09.559
The war's gonna be over soon,
and we're gonna have a lot of building to do.

01:01:09.583 --> 01:01:11.903
We're gonna need more energy
than we've ever needed before.

01:01:12.586 --> 01:01:14.953
When it comes to land
over the needs of the people,

01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:18.126
I think I'd have to take people anytime.

01:01:18.258 --> 01:01:22.093
Boy, it sounds to me like
a bunch of speeches I heard

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:25.133
when they was trying to get me
to re-enlist in the army.

01:01:26.266 --> 01:01:29.225
They sure don't seem
to have done a lot of good, do they?

01:01:30.395 --> 01:01:32.227
I'm with the lady.

01:01:33.732 --> 01:01:35.314
Got your answer, Virg.

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:40.941
You know, Ella,
you could lose this place overnight.

01:01:42.407 --> 01:01:44.114
Miss Connors,
I think I know how you feel.

01:01:44.242 --> 01:01:47.906
I've dealt with a lot of ranchers who feel
the same way you both do about the land.

01:01:49.331 --> 01:01:51.197
Think it over.

01:01:51.333 --> 01:01:52.949
Good luck with your roundup.

01:01:53.084 --> 01:01:54.996
Be seeing you, Virg.

01:02:01.593 --> 01:02:03.459
Hyah! Hyah!

01:02:32.958 --> 01:02:34.824
I've been thinking.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:38.419
Imagine there could be something
to what that Atkinson said, you know?

01:02:39.506 --> 01:02:42.544
- What are you talking about?
- Well...

01:02:42.676 --> 01:02:47.137
I mean, if you was to agree
and they was to find oil,

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:49.722
you'd have enough money,
you'd be set for life.

01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:56.096
Then you'd be shed of Ewing's and of me,
all them things that bother you so much.

01:02:56.231 --> 01:02:59.440
I see you don't always
look at both sides of things.

01:02:59.567 --> 01:03:02.230
Ain't about to start now.

01:03:02.362 --> 01:03:04.399
Guess you're not.

01:03:05.573 --> 01:03:10.693
But I thought with all that oil money, hell,
you could buy you a nice house in the city.

01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:14.789
Be a real fine lady. Real fine lady.

01:03:14.916 --> 01:03:19.206
Drink champagne
and eat that there caviar.

01:03:22.424 --> 01:03:24.711
Drink tea, you know,
with your pinkie up in the air.

01:03:24.843 --> 01:03:29.304
Wear them nice little silk dresses
with them flowers all over it.

01:03:33.226 --> 01:03:37.220
- Ain't that a pretty picture?
- Yes, ma'am. I think it is.

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:45.895
I knew she'd never let you oil people
piss on that land,

01:03:46.031 --> 01:03:48.444
even if it meant losing it to me.

01:03:48.575 --> 01:03:50.737
I don't think
she's gonna lose it to you, Jacob.

01:03:50.869 --> 01:03:53.657
Virgil tells me she and Athearn
are rounding up enough cattle

01:03:53.788 --> 01:03:55.825
to see them through another year.

01:03:57.292 --> 01:03:59.579
Ella and that young cowboy
make quite a team.

01:04:01.713 --> 01:04:03.921
I admire you, Jacob.

01:04:04.049 --> 01:04:07.918
My father always said you were
one of the last of the great empire builders.

01:04:08.053 --> 01:04:10.261
Your father understood.

01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:13.347
My father was a rich man's son
who played with money.

01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:17.468
But I'm not him.

01:04:18.772 --> 01:04:23.267
Of all the money my father lent you,
you've never paid back a cent.

01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:26.235
I'm not asking you for the money
you owe my family.

01:04:27.655 --> 01:04:30.113
But I want to test for oil on this land.

01:04:33.661 --> 01:04:37.575
When my people have had a chance
to study the findings, we'll talk again.

01:04:50.428 --> 01:04:53.216
And what if I don't go along with you?

01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:01.729
I know how much
this ranch means to you, Jacob.

01:05:03.775 --> 01:05:05.607
I'd hate to see you lose it.

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:11.127
Goddamn!

01:06:27.525 --> 01:06:29.858
Let me get my air.

01:06:31.237 --> 01:06:32.978
Frank!

01:06:42.499 --> 01:06:44.616
I just gotta get my air.

01:06:44.751 --> 01:06:46.959
Get the truck.

01:06:50.632 --> 01:06:52.373
Dammit!

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:22.449
Doc says your limbs
are gonna be fine, old man.

01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:25.288
Gonna have to stay put for a while.

01:07:25.416 --> 01:07:27.954
Hell, I ain't that sick.

01:07:28.086 --> 01:07:31.955
Besides, we still got
a hell of a lot of work to do.

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:34.794
Well, we got us a bunch.

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:40.505
Man's trying to tell you
he's straight as a skeeter's peter

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.427
in the middle of the mating season.

01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:51.353
I've been watching you
pretty close, Buck,

01:07:51.484 --> 01:07:56.354
and I can tell you was taught
by old Joe Voss.

01:07:56.489 --> 01:07:59.527
He's as good a cowboy as I ever met.

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:05.279
I figure you could cut
his trail any old day.

01:08:08.585 --> 01:08:11.123
I never had his seam squirrels.

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:14.247
I always figured
that's what made him so fast.

01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:20.377
He was the most cootie-laden critter
God ever put hair on.

01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:22.720
But he was a cowboy.

01:08:27.854 --> 01:08:29.937
I imagine.

01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:38.229
Are you gonna give me a chew, Buck?

01:08:40.198 --> 01:08:42.236
Hell, you bet.

01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:48.705
All I got here is this Copenhagen.

01:08:50.251 --> 01:08:52.618
Well, that's good enough.

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:58.499
Yeah, I thought it might be.

01:09:06.017 --> 01:09:09.010
You save me a pinch, now.

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:10.555
Yeah.

01:09:18.613 --> 01:09:20.899
I'm gonna go tend to the horses.

01:09:38.006 --> 01:09:39.006
Ella?

01:09:44.471 --> 01:09:47.886
You ought to know better than anyone,

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:52.307
I won't allow no lying under my roof...

01:09:55.358 --> 01:09:59.227
except some of my own tall tales.

01:10:03.908 --> 01:10:07.072
But I know and you know,

01:10:08.913 --> 01:10:12.452
my roping and riding days is over.

01:10:23.511 --> 01:10:25.878
Who's top dog, baby sister?

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:33.518
The one that fights the hardest.

01:10:43.614 --> 01:10:49.360
No matter what you think,
your dad would be damn proud of you.

01:11:54.852 --> 01:11:57.219
Whoa, son.

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:18.950
Steady.

01:14:50.736 --> 01:14:53.228
My garden's dying.

01:14:53.364 --> 01:14:55.651
It just needs a little water.

01:15:22.309 --> 01:15:24.141
Windmill broke.

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:30.019
It's just an old machine.

01:15:58.095 --> 01:16:00.712
God damn you, Ewing!

01:16:03.184 --> 01:16:05.847
God damn your soul!

01:17:13.379 --> 01:17:17.749
I imagine we got us
a big enough herd right now.

01:17:24.765 --> 01:17:28.600
No sense getting hoggish
about the whole thing here.

01:17:28.727 --> 01:17:32.687
Especially with the weather getting bad
as it is. It kind of spooks me.

01:17:33.774 --> 01:17:40.317
We turned out them good bulls
and nice heifers.

01:17:40.447 --> 01:17:43.110
You have a nice start for next year.

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:54.289
I guess what I'm saying is we could
just go with what we got, you know?

01:17:55.504 --> 01:17:56.915
What do you think?

01:18:12.563 --> 01:18:14.896
I slept with Ewing.

01:18:24.074 --> 01:18:26.316
I slept with Ewing when I was a girl.

01:18:41.967 --> 01:18:45.085
He was always watching me.

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:50.765
I was forbid to go near him,
but he was always watching me and...

01:18:54.521 --> 01:18:58.060
I'd come home from school
or I'd be out working the herd,

01:18:58.192 --> 01:19:01.481
out by myself somewhere.

01:19:01.612 --> 01:19:05.526
He'd be there just looking at me
and waiting.

01:19:08.118 --> 01:19:10.701
Never said nothing, just...

01:19:12.915 --> 01:19:15.077
just watching me and waiting.

01:19:16.961 --> 01:19:18.748
And he had me.

01:19:24.843 --> 01:19:28.382
My dad won a law case against him
over the land.

01:19:30.057 --> 01:19:33.516
One night me and Dodger
and my dad were eating supper and he...

01:19:33.644 --> 01:19:36.728
rode up yelling
for my dad to come outside.

01:19:39.817 --> 01:19:42.730
I stood right next to my dad on the porch.

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:46.988
Ewing told him every damn thing we did.

01:19:54.999 --> 01:19:59.164
My dad looked at me to tell him
it wasn't true. I couldn't do it.

01:20:03.549 --> 01:20:06.917
Just broke him. Just broke him.

01:20:10.306 --> 01:20:12.389
I hate him.

01:20:15.019 --> 01:20:17.056
I hate him.

01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:00.262
You know, it's gonna be, uh...

01:21:02.816 --> 01:21:06.230
nearly impossible for the two of us
to drive that herd down the hill,

01:21:06.362 --> 01:21:12.984
so I was thinking, well,
we ought to hire some hands

01:21:13.118 --> 01:21:16.862
to help us get them
from here down to the ranch,

01:21:16.997 --> 01:21:19.990
then from, uh...

01:21:20.125 --> 01:21:24.369
you know, from the ranch to wherever the hell
it is we're gonna sell 'em.

01:21:29.927 --> 01:21:36.345
I was just thinking I ought to go into town
and hire us some help.

01:21:39.019 --> 01:21:41.636
Thought maybe I'd go tomorrow.

01:21:44.316 --> 01:21:46.478
What do you think?

01:21:47.945 --> 01:21:49.186
Hmm?

01:21:56.078 --> 01:21:57.785
Yeah.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.333
- How was your trip?
- It was a little rough.

01:22:45.461 --> 01:22:47.418
There was turbulence in the mountains.

01:22:47.546 --> 01:22:52.041
Mr Ewing, these are all records of the
seismic shooting we've done on your ranch.

01:22:53.010 --> 01:22:58.256
We completely covered your land,
all the way to Ella Connors' property line.

01:22:58.390 --> 01:23:02.760
The only place where it would be
economically feasible for us to drill a test

01:23:02.895 --> 01:23:04.602
would be somewhere in here.

01:23:05.272 --> 01:23:08.481
Now, that's on the Connors' ranch
and she's not gonna let us drill there.

01:23:09.568 --> 01:23:11.901
But there's another possibility.

01:23:12.029 --> 01:23:15.568
We could drill diagonally under her land,

01:23:15.699 --> 01:23:20.160
from the edge of the creek
at this point on your property.

01:23:20.287 --> 01:23:23.075
Now, we wouldn't have to put
any hardware at all on her land.

01:23:23.207 --> 01:23:26.791
- It'd probably be easy to get her permission.
- Thank you, George.

01:23:29.546 --> 01:23:31.913
You can leave the reports here.

01:23:35.969 --> 01:23:37.801
Thank you.

01:23:50.901 --> 01:23:53.484
Now what are you going to do?

01:23:55.405 --> 01:23:58.022
Wait her out,

01:23:58.158 --> 01:24:00.946
and hope, like you do,
that she'll go under.

01:24:03.121 --> 01:24:04.908
That could take quite a while.

01:24:05.832 --> 01:24:08.449
Yeah, it could.

01:24:09.586 --> 01:24:11.748
In the meantime,

01:24:12.965 --> 01:24:15.878
what do I do to protect my interests
from you?

01:24:17.261 --> 01:24:19.753
If you could stop me, you would.

01:24:21.098 --> 01:24:23.590
The only way to protect myself

01:24:24.643 --> 01:24:27.101
is to have the Ewing ranch in my name.

01:24:28.313 --> 01:24:31.056
I've gone over the whole situation.

01:24:32.776 --> 01:24:34.563
With whom?

01:24:35.654 --> 01:24:37.896
With Hoverton. With the bank.

01:24:40.242 --> 01:24:43.861
You talked to Hoverton
about taking over my ranch?

01:24:45.289 --> 01:24:48.123
Well, you don't own the bank, Jacob.

01:24:50.627 --> 01:24:52.584
There was a time.

01:24:53.505 --> 01:24:56.248
I'll make it as easy as I can for you.

01:24:56.383 --> 01:25:00.468
We'll behave as if you were still
the owner of the ranch.

01:25:04.808 --> 01:25:10.224
If you were in my position and you thought
there was a chance for oil in this valley,

01:25:10.355 --> 01:25:12.517
wouldn't you protect yourself
by taking it over?

01:25:13.317 --> 01:25:15.900
If you were me, what would you do?

01:25:17.946 --> 01:25:20.859
I'd squeeze so hard
your nuts would fall off.

01:25:25.495 --> 01:25:27.487
Hey, Neil, you don't have to leave.

01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:34.793
Might as well make yourself at home.

01:25:35.922 --> 01:25:39.131
Hell, the house is as good as yours now.

01:25:49.728 --> 01:25:51.811
Tell me, Neil.

01:25:54.316 --> 01:25:56.558
When you retire me...

01:25:57.319 --> 01:25:59.402
are you gonna give me a gold watch?

01:26:23.595 --> 01:26:25.757
JW.

01:26:25.889 --> 01:26:28.097
Sit down, boys.

01:26:44.741 --> 01:26:46.858
I understand
Ella and that soldier boy

01:26:46.993 --> 01:26:50.452
have rounded up enough cattle
to hang on for another year.

01:26:52.457 --> 01:26:56.417
You hadn't ought
to worry about that, JW.

01:26:56.545 --> 01:27:00.038
Just because they've got them penned

01:27:00.173 --> 01:27:03.166
sure don't mean
that they're gonna stay penned.

01:27:05.303 --> 01:27:07.215
They could be stopped...

01:27:08.932 --> 01:27:10.798
real easy.

01:27:17.357 --> 01:27:19.474
Ever since there have been Ewings,

01:27:21.027 --> 01:27:23.940
there's been Blockers and Coles
at their side.

01:27:26.616 --> 01:27:28.573
Through everything.

01:27:29.703 --> 01:27:33.037
Nesters. Rustlers. All our enemies.

01:27:40.714 --> 01:27:44.298
When I was a boy,
I saw a bulldog take a bull by the nose

01:27:44.426 --> 01:27:47.169
and wrestle him to the ground.

01:27:51.558 --> 01:27:54.301
The dog bit too hard

01:27:54.436 --> 01:27:57.349
and the bull
stomped that dog to death.

01:28:02.652 --> 01:28:04.564
Well, boys...

01:28:06.865 --> 01:28:09.733
we got a whole pack of dogs to deal with.

01:30:03.315 --> 01:30:05.853
Hyah! Hyah...!

01:31:43.331 --> 01:31:45.243
Hyah! Hup! Hyah!

01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:22.443
Hyah! Hyah...!

01:34:53.229 --> 01:34:56.347
Imagine you'd like to try
one of them?

01:35:05.450 --> 01:35:08.534
Think you might like
to take your jacket off?

01:35:19.130 --> 01:35:21.622
Now, let's do the Texas Star.

01:35:25.970 --> 01:35:29.930
Bow to your partner,
then bow to your corner.

01:35:30.058 --> 01:35:33.551
Now swing your partner,
to the left, whirl. Hey!

01:35:36.231 --> 01:35:40.601
I think I'd better get started. I want
to get into those hills before it gets dark.

01:35:41.778 --> 01:35:45.317
Julie, pack up some chow for Mr Atkinson.

01:35:45.448 --> 01:35:48.065
- It's all taken care of, JW.
- Good.

01:35:54.332 --> 01:35:55.823
Julie...

01:35:56.918 --> 01:36:01.288
I think you ought to know we'll both be working
for Mr Atkinson from now on.

01:36:01.422 --> 01:36:03.664
Is that a fact?

01:36:08.471 --> 01:36:13.387
I surely do appreciate you not saying anything
to anyone about taking over, Neil.

01:36:13.518 --> 01:36:16.386
You'll see, Jacob,
everything is gonna work out just fine.

01:36:34.706 --> 01:36:37.824
- Into the centre, let's hear you yell.
- Whoa!

01:38:10.802 --> 01:38:14.216
Good stock, but a bit old.

01:38:14.347 --> 01:38:17.090
I suspect a mite on the tough side.

01:38:17.225 --> 01:38:19.387
You won't find better beef,
and you know it.

01:38:19.519 --> 01:38:22.227
You should have sold 'em
a long time ago.

01:38:26.609 --> 01:38:29.898
We talking should-haves and what-ifs
or we talking cattle?

01:38:34.534 --> 01:38:37.698
I don't image you'll need a pencil
to give us a price or nothin'.

01:38:43.543 --> 01:38:45.409
I like to make things official.

01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:53.543
- You call that a price?
- I do.

01:38:53.678 --> 01:38:56.671
You only have about 40 good head
in that whole herd.

01:38:58.766 --> 01:39:03.136
Most of those cows' heads are sore
from being tied to the trees.

01:39:04.147 --> 01:39:05.683
Army ain't buying anymore.

01:39:06.399 --> 01:39:09.517
Everybody knows
the war is coming to an end.

01:39:09.652 --> 01:39:12.611
I think five cents is a good price.

01:39:16.742 --> 01:39:18.950
Well, I think, uh...

01:39:20.830 --> 01:39:23.243
there'll be other buyers.

01:39:49.984 --> 01:39:52.271
How about five and a half cents?

01:39:53.362 --> 01:39:54.944
How about...

01:39:58.326 --> 01:40:00.534
us thanking you for your time?

01:40:00.661 --> 01:40:04.701
It's been a long trip. We appreciate it.
Now we'll just say goodbye.

01:40:41.911 --> 01:40:45.530
Six cents and we do business.

01:40:45.665 --> 01:40:49.204
I'm only doing that now
because I've known Ella so long.

01:40:49.335 --> 01:40:51.577
That include delivery
or we gotta bring 'em in?

01:40:54.507 --> 01:40:58.547
- No, you deliver.
- No, um...

01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:05.925
We deliver,
I imagine we need another penny.

01:41:09.313 --> 01:41:12.306
We're doing the work and all,
and weight loss...

01:41:14.318 --> 01:41:16.105
Got to get another penny.

01:41:32.253 --> 01:41:34.666
She was tough in the old days.

01:41:39.218 --> 01:41:41.380
But the two of you is just plum awful.

01:41:44.432 --> 01:41:47.095
OK. Seven cents.

01:41:48.185 --> 01:41:50.928
And that's as high
as I'm going to go now.

01:41:52.398 --> 01:41:53.605
Is that a deal?

01:42:03.743 --> 01:42:05.575
Deal.

01:42:08.039 --> 01:42:09.951
Yeah, right.

01:42:10.082 --> 01:42:15.123
Congratulations. You're sure getting
this place back on its feet again.

01:42:17.423 --> 01:42:18.664
Yeah.

01:42:20.134 --> 01:42:22.592
I'll see you in town with them, then.

01:42:24.013 --> 01:42:28.257
And don't be watering them just before
you get to town to add a little extra weight.

01:42:29.894 --> 01:42:31.601
So long, Ellie.

01:42:32.438 --> 01:42:34.225
So long, Cliff.

01:42:40.071 --> 01:42:41.812
Imagine!

01:43:12.770 --> 01:43:14.432
Sit down, Virgil.

01:43:19.026 --> 01:43:21.313
Thanks, JW.

01:43:30.037 --> 01:43:31.653
It was sad about Neil.

01:43:33.290 --> 01:43:35.748
Yes, it is.

01:43:37.002 --> 01:43:39.244
I understand, er...

01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:45.334
you're going over to Ella's later on
to pick up payment on her note.

01:43:46.637 --> 01:43:48.674
Well... yes, I am.

01:43:48.806 --> 01:43:50.297
Gonna celebrate?

01:43:53.144 --> 01:43:56.933
Like you and Neil did
when you talked about taking me over?

01:43:57.982 --> 01:44:02.147
Now, JW,
it wasn't anything like that at all.

01:44:03.863 --> 01:44:05.445
I had no choice in the matter.

01:44:05.573 --> 01:44:07.906
Oh, I figure you did, Virgil.

01:44:09.118 --> 01:44:14.113
JW, I have to tell you, I have
Neil's instructions regarding the ranch.

01:44:14.248 --> 01:44:17.241
Oh? Neil left instructions...

01:44:18.878 --> 01:44:20.790
to you?

01:44:20.921 --> 01:44:22.958
Well, yes.

01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:25.878
I have to put the takeover
in the works.

01:44:26.010 --> 01:44:28.468
But you don't have to worry, JW.

01:44:28.596 --> 01:44:34.183
He left specific instructions that you were
to still run the ranch, at a good salary.

01:44:35.269 --> 01:44:38.103
The ranch will still bear the Ewing name.

01:44:38.230 --> 01:44:40.313
You're gonna be well taken care of, JW.

01:44:44.945 --> 01:44:47.653
I hate to be the one to do this.

01:44:51.702 --> 01:44:54.740
But you have to look at it
from my position, JW.

01:44:56.916 --> 01:45:01.126
You see, my first responsibility
is to the bank.

01:45:01.253 --> 01:45:03.586
You're talking to me about the bank?

01:45:05.508 --> 01:45:07.875
My grandpa built that bank.

01:45:08.010 --> 01:45:10.502
Well, I know that, JW.

01:45:10.638 --> 01:45:14.678
Well, you might, since you were the one
who came whining to us for money

01:45:14.809 --> 01:45:16.892
when the bank was failing in '29.

01:45:17.770 --> 01:45:20.137
We never failed you, Virgil.

01:45:25.694 --> 01:45:29.563
Trusted you...
and you sold us out.

01:45:32.868 --> 01:45:36.202
Guess I've gotta rank you
with a dog, Virgil.

01:46:38.726 --> 01:46:40.934
Sit down.

01:46:55.034 --> 01:46:57.276
Big day for you, ain't it?

01:46:59.079 --> 01:47:00.490
Cattle to market.

01:47:01.832 --> 01:47:03.869
Debts about to be paid.

01:47:07.796 --> 01:47:10.083
New man in your life.

01:47:15.596 --> 01:47:17.679
You'd best get out of here, JW.

01:47:21.685 --> 01:47:26.646
I never wanted it to happen this way,
but you left me no choice.

01:47:27.566 --> 01:47:30.229
I'm gonna give you one more chance.

01:47:33.656 --> 01:47:35.989
You don't give nothing.

01:47:37.868 --> 01:47:41.452
If you want my land,
you're gonna have to kill me.

01:47:42.539 --> 01:47:45.031
That's the way it's always been for you.

01:47:47.795 --> 01:47:50.003
One of us had to kill the other.

01:47:50.923 --> 01:47:52.585
No.

01:47:55.636 --> 01:47:59.346
I just wanted to be left in peace
to work my land.

01:47:59.473 --> 01:48:02.557
Whatever happens now,
you've brought it on yourself.

01:48:04.019 --> 01:48:07.012
You're not gonna get away with it,
you know that.

01:48:07.147 --> 01:48:09.480
Hoverton's on his way out here.

01:51:07.369 --> 01:51:09.110
Frank!

01:51:31.852 --> 01:51:34.139
Cut the rope on my hands.
