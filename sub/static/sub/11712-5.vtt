The stove was on.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.945
Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry.

19:14.945 --> 19:16.363
I got distracted.

19:16.363 --> 19:18.824
Damn you,
tiny cakes.

19:19.158 --> 19:22.161
Well, it's okay.
No one got hurt.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.705
This time.

19:25.038 --> 19:26.498
We'll see you guys
tomorrow.

19:26.498 --> 19:28.167
Yeah.
Oh, hey, by the way,

19:28.167 --> 19:30.419
we had to cancel the dinner
party with the Bennetts,

19:30.419 --> 19:33.630
but we're gonna reschedule.
You better.

Iced tea bottle,
diet peach?

19:38.594 --> 19:41.096
Nice odd,
specific details.

19:41.096 --> 19:42.764
I don't know
where that came from.

19:42.764 --> 19:46.477
Hey, you've been observing
the master all these years.

19:46.477 --> 19:50.272
It turns out you're
kind of a natural.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.732
Maybe.

19:51.732 --> 19:54.109
But how about from now on
we make an agreement, right?

19:54.109 --> 19:56.570
We only use our lying skills
on the outside world,

19:56.570 --> 19:58.322
not on each other.
You got a deal.

19:58.322 --> 20:00.866
And in that spirit,
the giant spider

20:00.866 --> 20:03.744
did not go crawl into
a pair of your shoes.

20:03.744 --> 20:04.453
Aw.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.705
It went into
those slippers.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.999
Oh! Ew, ew, ew, ew!

20:13.962 --> 20:15.171
Oh, you just
wanna split it?

20:15.171 --> 20:16.798
Well,
you kind of still owe me

20:16.798 --> 20:19.175
for those roulette bets
I placed for you.

20:19.175 --> 20:20.176
Oh, right.

20:20.176 --> 20:23.805
I really thought you were gonna
win that second spin.

20:23.805 --> 20:24.973
It landed in the black

20:24.973 --> 20:28.101
but it just popped out
the last second.

Hey, guys.

20:32.356 --> 20:33.440
Hey.
Hey.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.776
Oh, thank you, guys
for coming to our party.

20:35.776 --> 20:36.610
We had such
a great time.

20:36.610 --> 20:39.238
And I'm sorry we didn't
get to talk last night.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.113
Where were
you two hiding?

20:40.113 --> 20:42.908
Actually, we weren't there.
We went to Atlantic City.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.743
But we got the bottle
of wine you brought.

20:44.743 --> 20:47.663
We didn't bring any wine.
We didn't go.

20:47.663 --> 20:49.039
It was clearly labeled:

20:49.039 --> 20:50.832
"From Jeff and Audrey."

20:50.832 --> 20:52.501
Very classy.

20:53.377 --> 20:56.004
Wait, you guys
were at their party?

20:57.172 --> 20:58.882
Just...

20:58.882 --> 21:00.884
I believe

21:00.884 --> 21:02.803
this is yours.
