- Whatever the reason,

03:35.279 --> 03:37.929

03:38.032 --> 03:40.032

09:41.050 --> 09:44.919
We should claim Obama cheated
when he won

09:44.920 --> 09:47.687
the Nobel Peace Prize
because he wears hats,

09:47.789 --> 09:51.658
and we don't know if those hats
hid additional brains.

09:51.760 --> 09:53.260
Why don't you do what you always

09:53.362 --> 09:55.462
tell people you're gonna do,
kill Obamacare?

09:55.564 --> 09:58.865

we were loving
the housing bubble, right?

10:15.116 --> 10:16.516
Five houses. Ten cars.

10:16.517 --> 10:19.218
Working at a shoe store.
What could go wrong?

10:19.320 --> 10:21.654
It's time we got back
to those good, old days.

10:21.756 --> 10:23.256
That's where Nuch comes in.

10:23.358 --> 10:26.526
Effective immediately,
every American will receive

10:26.627 --> 10:29.095
an alarmingly generous housing loan.

10:29.197 --> 10:32.197
All you have to do
is successfully navigate

10:32.299 --> 10:34.800
your bank's revolving door
and just tell them,

10:34.902 --> 10:36.735
"I know what a house is."

10:36.837 --> 10:38.971
Wow. That sounds
too good to be true.

10:39.073 --> 10:40.172
Is there a downside?

10:40.274 --> 10:45.544
That's a good question, Mr. President,
and the answer is... no.

10:45.646 --> 10:47.546
Thank you for joining me
for three beers.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.648
Yeah, no problem.
Uh, so, where are you from?

10:50.750 --> 10:52.850
I was raised
in Santa Monica, California.

10:52.953 --> 10:55.987
- Liberal family. You?
- New Jersey. Liberal family.

10:56.090 --> 10:58.890
Uh, now they're all like,
"Hey, why are you doing all this?"

10:58.992 --> 11:00.092
I understand completely.

11:00.194 --> 11:01.394
It seems like just yesterday,

11:01.395 --> 11:03.695
I was mailing
white powder to Sarah Lawrence,

11:03.797 --> 11:05.863
and now look at me,
I'm basically president.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.732
It's true.
I mean, you're the guy.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.667
I guess I'm just here for advice.

11:09.769 --> 11:11.736
Jared, what you said is appreciated.

11:11.838 --> 11:14.538
First question, how do
you tell a tall, thin boy

11:14.641 --> 11:17.842
- that you think he's cool?
- I think you just did.

11:17.944 --> 11:19.978
Good news, folks.
The housing bubble?

11:20.080 --> 11:22.646
It's getting big,
and it's getting big fast.

11:22.748 --> 11:25.349
Cover your eyes 'cause
that baby's about to pop.

11:25.451 --> 11:28.452
More good news!
After Obama wouldn't let it die,

11:28.554 --> 11:31.922
we're finally putting the auto
industry out of its misery!

11:32.024 --> 11:34.825
Soon we will release
all of these deer

11:34.927 --> 11:37.794
and many more
onto our nation's roadways,

11:37.896 --> 11:41.564
rendering vehicular travel
impossibly deadly,

11:41.667 --> 11:44.101
therefore cratering
the auto industry

11:44.202 --> 11:48.672
and reversing another one
of Obama's terrible accomplishments.

11:48.774 --> 11:50.173
Where will you find enough deer

11:50.275 --> 11:53.010
to cover the entirety of
the interstate highway system?

11:53.112 --> 11:56.212
How dare you question my ability
to put deers in estrus!

11:56.314 --> 11:59.382
If I arouse deer half
as well as you waste my time,

11:59.484 --> 12:01.317
I think we'll be just fine!

12:01.419 --> 12:03.186
Wow.
How is this guy single?

12:04.756 --> 12:08.057
<i>Time to finish
the job that Obama finished.</i>

12:08.160 --> 12:12.161
And we're recovered Osama bin Laden's
corpse for eventual re-killing.

12:12.263 --> 12:14.463
Just so you know, sir,
due to ocean conditions,

12:14.565 --> 12:17.900
the body is less a body
and more a barnacle-covered jelly.

12:18.002 --> 12:20.169
Grind those barnacles
into my breakfast,

12:20.271 --> 12:24.639
squirt the jelly into a big doughnut,
and initiate phase two.

12:26.177 --> 12:29.144
Don't worry.
We unplugged that thing months ago.

12:29.446 --> 12:33.282
<i>Welcome to the most
exciting night in football.</i>

12:33.384 --> 12:36.985
<i>And now, please rise for the
singing of the national anthem</i>

12:37.087 --> 12:41.756
<i>by Senior White House Advisor
Stephen Miller!</i>

12:48.732 --> 12:49.964
O say can you see,
by the dawn's early light,

12:50.067 --> 12:51.599
what so proudly we hailed
at the twilight's last gleaming?

12:51.702 --> 12:53.434
Whose broad stripes and bright
stars through the perilous fight

12:53.536 --> 12:55.136
o'er the ramparts we watched
were so gallantly streaming?

12:55.238 --> 12:56.738
And the rockets' red glare,
the bombs bursting in air,

12:56.840 --> 12:58.272
gave proof through the night
that our flag was still there.

12:58.374 --> 12:59.607
O say does that star-spangled
banner yet wave

12:59.709 --> 13:01.775
o'er the land of the free
and the home of the brave?

13:03.846 --> 13:05.580
<i>And now, an announcement</i>

13:05.682 --> 13:08.115
<i>from the President of the United States.</i>

13:15.191 --> 13:17.257
<i>Oh, God.
You can do it. Come on.</i>

13:17.359 --> 13:19.593
<i>Come on.
Oh, God.</i>

13:21.063 --> 13:24.664
<i> I can do it!
Good evening!</i>

13:24.767 --> 13:29.402
<i>Tonight, I can report to the
American people and to the world</i>

13:29.504 --> 13:34.140
<i>that the United States has conducted
a successful operation</i>

13:34.243 --> 13:37.510
<i>to capture
Osama bin Laden's corpse!</i>

13:37.613 --> 13:42.815
<i>Now please direct your
attention to the 30-yard line</i>

13:42.917 --> 13:46.553
<i>where we're going to kill
Osama bin Laden</i>

13:46.655 --> 13:50.123
<i>way better than Obama ever did!</i>

13:56.197 --> 13:57.696
Head counts, so it's good!

13:59.100 --> 14:00.532
<i>Tremendous!</i>

14:00.635 --> 14:03.970
<i>You people are so great!
In fact...</i>

14:04.072 --> 14:07.339
<i>♪ I'm ♪</i>

14:07.441 --> 14:12.010
<i>♪ Showering love on you ♪</i>

14:12.112 --> 14:14.747
<i>We don't like this.</i>

14:14.848 --> 14:16.815
<i>Forget it!
Goodnight, people!</i>

14:16.917 --> 14:20.152
<i>I'd say drive safe, but there's
deer frickin' everywhere!</i>

14:20.254 --> 14:21.620
- Whoo!
- Whoo-whoo!

14:21.722 --> 14:23.054
- We did it!
- We did it!

14:23.157 --> 14:24.756
- We did it!
- Whoo! Let's go!

14:24.858 --> 14:27.759
I thought it was a really
wonderful moment for America.

14:27.861 --> 14:30.128
Suck my nuts, John Adams!

14:30.230 --> 14:33.498
We kicked a field goal
with Osama bin Laden's head

14:33.600 --> 14:37.302
in front of 100 million people.
How do you top that?

14:37.404 --> 14:41.739
- So, how do we top it?
- What are you talking about, man?

14:41.841 --> 14:44.909
We already kinda destroyed
everything Obama did.

14:45.011 --> 14:47.912
We only came in here today
because we thought there'd be cake!

14:48.014 --> 14:49.980
Bite your tongue,
or I'll bite it for you.

14:50.082 --> 14:52.784
That's the sound it would make.

14:52.885 --> 14:54.852
We need ideas,
and we need them now.

14:54.954 --> 14:57.521
We took Susan B. Anthony
off the silver dollar.

14:57.623 --> 15:00.057
And went back to life sentences
for crack smokers.

15:00.159 --> 15:02.659
And sent SEAL Team Six
to the Kenyan hall of records

15:02.761 --> 15:04.594
to find that Obama birth certificate.

15:04.697 --> 15:07.497
Oh, I never really believed that,
but the racists liked it.

15:07.599 --> 15:09.867
I wasn't gonna tell those kids
there's no Santa.

15:09.969 --> 15:12.202
I'll say it again.
The beast must be fed.

15:12.304 --> 15:14.371
A sprig of wheat will not suffice,

15:14.473 --> 15:16.906
nor grain, nor grape,
nor fields of rice.

15:17.008 --> 15:19.175
Okay, we get it.
You can rhyme foods.

15:19.277 --> 15:21.578
I can do that, too.
Ham...

15:21.680 --> 15:24.548
- Ham can...
- I have a few ideas.

15:24.650 --> 15:27.050
We can rescind federal code Title 5.

15:27.152 --> 15:28.985
- Shut up.
- You need a time out, mister.

15:29.087 --> 15:30.153
- No!
- Fuck you!

15:30.255 --> 15:32.788
- Oh, eat my ass.
- Psst! Hello?

15:32.891 --> 15:34.724
Mr. President, are you okay?

15:34.826 --> 15:38.427
I can't believe there's
nothing left to undo.

15:38.529 --> 15:42.365
I guess I'll go see what
happens when I put cake

15:42.366 --> 15:46.268
- in my popcorn maker.
- Wait, so there was cake?

15:46.371 --> 15:49.405
So I told that snowflake,
"Give me a thicker tarantula,

15:49.507 --> 15:51.907
or I'm gonna stomp every turtle
in this pet store."

15:52.009 --> 15:54.176
Jared, is something wrong?

15:54.278 --> 15:56.379
You've only had five sips
of your first beer.

15:56.481 --> 15:59.181
Each beer is 10 to 12 sips,
and we've got two more to go.

15:59.283 --> 16:01.483
Stephen, I don't know
if I can do this anymore.

16:01.585 --> 16:03.385
Wow. I cannot believe
what I'm hearing.

16:03.487 --> 16:05.087
What is the source of this problem?

16:05.189 --> 16:07.789
If you don't like the tarantulas,
consider them stomped.

16:07.892 --> 16:09.557
No, it's not just the tarantulas.

16:09.659 --> 16:11.593
It ... It's, like,
your whole thing, okay?

16:11.695 --> 16:13.328
- We're just not working.
- Oh, no.

16:13.430 --> 16:15.030
You are not
breaking up with me.

16:15.132 --> 16:18.800
I am breaking up with you!
You've made a powerful enemy.

16:18.902 --> 16:22.370
Get out of my way!
I went to Duke University, idiots!

16:23.189 --> 16:25.540
<i>Breaking news tonight.
President Trump has been unable</i>

16:25.642 --> 16:27.542
<i>to find another Obama
initiative to kill,</i>

16:27.644 --> 16:31.946
<i>and as a result has fallen
into a depression spiral</i>

16:32.048 --> 16:33.548
<i>that, according to our sources,</i>

16:33.650 --> 16:36.717
<i>no amount of chicken parts can cure.</i>

16:36.819 --> 16:41.455
They said, "Run for office.
You won't win, but it'll be fun.

16:41.557 --> 16:43.791
You'll get a TV network out of it."

16:43.893 --> 16:45.192
And now look at me,

16:45.295 --> 16:48.662
tossing out red meat
to a bunch of strangers.

16:48.764 --> 16:52.433
Wall, Islam, Islam,
blah, blah, blah.

16:52.535 --> 16:54.768
You know what you should
be more worried about?

16:54.870 --> 16:56.503
Your hearts exploding.

16:56.605 --> 17:00.808
Coal miners, you're really
thinking about the future.

17:00.910 --> 17:04.176
I see so many kids walking
around playing with coal.

17:04.279 --> 17:06.012
What's your name?
Jeff?

17:06.114 --> 17:07.914
Fuck you, Jeff!

17:08.016 --> 17:09.482
<i> Hello, gentlemen.</i>

17:09.584 --> 17:11.417
- I'm your dad now.
- Excuse me?

17:11.519 --> 17:13.153
Your old father has been paralyzed.

17:13.255 --> 17:15.788
- What?!
- By his lack of self-worth.

17:15.890 --> 17:18.925
You may refer to me as Father,
Papa, or Stephen the Dad.

17:19.027 --> 17:21.578
- Dude, this is bullshit!
- Wash your mouth out!

17:21.579 --> 17:22.662
No television for a week!

17:22.763 --> 17:25.064
- You think I care?
- Fine. Two weeks.

17:25.165 --> 17:27.733
- You tell him, Dad.
- Eric, shut up!

17:27.836 --> 17:30.202
Miller, let me let you in
on a little secret here.

17:30.304 --> 17:32.137
I've never been
disciplined in my life,

17:32.239 --> 17:33.639
and I'm not about to start now.

17:33.741 --> 17:35.107
That's it!
Give me your phone.

17:35.209 --> 17:38.961
- You're not seeing that girl any more.
- You mean my wife?

17:38.962 --> 17:40.912
Dude, you are seriously loco.

17:41.015 --> 17:42.381
Eric, I'm proud of you.

17:42.483 --> 17:45.650
I'm gonna take you to 7-Eleven
and get you a big soda.

17:45.752 --> 17:48.720
- Can I sit in the front?
- Fine, but don't touch the radio.

17:48.822 --> 17:50.990
That's Mommy's.
I'm also your mom.

17:55.296 --> 17:56.828
This is weird.
I don't know.

17:56.930 --> 17:59.297
Maybe just make up something
to goose him awake.

17:59.399 --> 18:00.799
Good news, Mr. President.

18:00.901 --> 18:03.401
Congress has agreed to build the wall.

18:03.504 --> 18:05.370
That would be cool
if anything mattered.

18:05.472 --> 18:06.838
I know what will cheer him up.

18:06.940 --> 18:10.208
Hey, Donny, how would you like
to take the nuclear football

18:10.310 --> 18:12.544
to Mar-a-Lago for the weekend, huh?

18:12.646 --> 18:16.047
- Pbht!
- Okay, that's it. He's gone.

18:25.025 --> 18:27.325
<i>Say what you will
about, uh, Mr. Trump.</i>

18:27.427 --> 18:30.293
<i>He certainly would bring
some change to the White House.</i>

18:37.737 --> 18:40.004
Is that what this is about?

18:40.105 --> 18:43.807
Yeah, you must have felt
pretty humiliated that night,

18:43.910 --> 18:46.510
so humiliated you decided
to run for president?

18:46.611 --> 18:47.810
Go away.

18:47.913 --> 18:50.647
Sir, I once had a boss
who humiliated me every day

18:50.749 --> 18:52.615
by putting his need
to watch television

18:52.717 --> 18:55.185
and eat an entire sheet cake
ahead of our nation.

18:55.287 --> 19:00.123
But someday, I'm gonna write
a shocking exposé

19:00.225 --> 19:03.325
that puts my boss
in prison or worse!

19:03.428 --> 19:06.029
That's a beautiful story,
but how does it relate to me?

19:06.130 --> 19:08.831
Your administration can't
go on like this, Mr. President.

19:08.934 --> 19:11.200
You have two choices ...
either let that night go

19:11.302 --> 19:12.902
or return to the battlefield.

19:13.004 --> 19:14.671
Look, I've got a lot to think about.

19:14.773 --> 19:18.322
I better get a full night's sleep.

19:25.183 --> 19:26.282
I got it!

19:26.384 --> 19:28.784
When's the next White House
Correspondents' Dinner?

19:28.886 --> 19:30.186
- April.
- Move it to tomorrow

19:30.288 --> 19:31.554
and make sure Obama's there.

19:31.655 --> 19:34.123
Consider it done, sir.
Should I give him a plus-one?

19:34.225 --> 19:35.958
Of course.
I'm not a monster.

19:36.410 --> 19:38.877
<i>All right, here's the plan.</i>

19:38.979 --> 19:41.713
I want to roast Obama
like he roasted me,

19:41.815 --> 19:43.581
and I'm gonna need great material.

19:43.683 --> 19:47.685
Jared, Stephen, you're the two
funniest guys I know. Start writing.

19:47.788 --> 19:50.989
- We're sort of taking a break right now.
- Don't care.

19:51.091 --> 19:53.625
If I can shred on guitar
the first time I touch one,

19:53.727 --> 19:55.793
you two can learn
to be friends again, okay?

19:55.895 --> 19:56.994
<i>Hey.</i>

19:57.096 --> 19:59.731
Uh, so, uh, where are
your tarantulas, huh?

19:59.832 --> 20:01.232
I fed them to the python.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.501
You've got a python?!
Where is it?

20:03.603 --> 20:06.170
I fed it to me.
My pizza was taking too long.

20:06.273 --> 20:09.106
Cool. Look, Stephen,
I don't know what happened.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.707
I thought we were doing great.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.110
Things were just moving
a little too fast for me.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.079
I mean, I've never met
someone like you.

20:15.181 --> 20:17.714
This happens a lot.
I always assumed new friends

20:17.817 --> 20:20.084
were part of a deep-state
conspiracy against me.

20:20.186 --> 20:21.685
Upon further research, I realized

20:21.788 --> 20:24.354
that the government just
doesn't have those resources.

20:24.456 --> 20:26.423
What do you say
we give this another shot?

20:26.525 --> 20:28.992
That would be great.
I just, uh, need a minute here.

20:29.094 --> 20:31.628
Python meat is the prune juice
of the animal kingdom.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.997
<i> Tonight from
the Washington Hilton,</i>

20:34.099 --> 20:35.465
<i>it's the hastily rescheduled</i>

20:35.567 --> 20:37.301
<i>White House
Correspondents' Dinner.</i>

20:37.403 --> 20:39.269
<i>The entire Beltway press corps is here</i>

20:39.371 --> 20:40.904
<i>for a night of fun and laughs</i>

20:41.006 --> 20:43.439
<i>with those they're supposed
to hold accountable.</i>

20:43.541 --> 20:45.541
- Is Obama here?
- Front-row center.

20:45.643 --> 20:47.677
I told him Richard Branson
would be here.

21:00.891 --> 21:03.793
- You sure this material's good?
- Uh, I don't know.

21:03.894 --> 21:05.695
I mean, Miller handled
the Obama slams,

21:05.797 --> 21:07.296
I did the self-deprecating stuff.

21:07.398 --> 21:10.265
Self-deprecating?
What would I deprecate?

21:10.368 --> 21:12.501
That I don't know
the meaning of "deprecate"?

21:12.603 --> 21:14.870
Well, they're on page two
if you get desperate.

21:14.972 --> 21:17.105
Stevie, I need you
to warm up the crowd.

21:17.208 --> 21:19.407
Sir, by the time
I'm done with them,

21:19.509 --> 21:22.177
they'll be boiling hot
and begging for mercy.

21:22.279 --> 21:23.745
What a goofball!

21:23.848 --> 21:26.548
<i>And now performing
his original composition,</i>

21:26.650 --> 21:28.717
<i>Blood Is Destiny,
Stephen Miller.</i>

21:28.819 --> 21:30.886
Restore order,

21:30.988 --> 21:32.620
embolden ancestors.

21:32.723 --> 21:37.859
- Blood is destiny.
- I love you, Stephen and Dad!

21:37.961 --> 21:40.628
- Oh, Jesus.
- # Blood is destiny #

21:40.731 --> 21:43.965
Wow, available wherever
animals are tortured.

21:44.067 --> 21:47.001
That was something.
But you know who isn't something?

21:47.103 --> 21:48.569
Barack Hussein Obama.

21:48.671 --> 21:51.572
I mean, this guy couldn't keep
Muslims out of his own family.

21:51.674 --> 21:54.575
How could he keep them
out of the United States?

21:54.677 --> 21:57.678
<i> Oh, my God.</i>

21:57.780 --> 22:00.014
You know the Obamas
had a dog named Bo

22:00.116 --> 22:01.682
who would often say, "Ruff, ruff."

22:01.784 --> 22:05.911
That's a good description of his
presidency, "Rough, rough."

22:07.757 --> 22:11.124
He also had a dog named Sunny.
How much dog can one man eat?

22:11.226 --> 22:13.360
 Oh!
Killing it, real Dad.

22:13.462 --> 22:17.998
Geez, these jokes are bigly crap.

22:18.100 --> 22:20.333
Crap like... me?

22:22.304 --> 22:24.204
Psst!
Page two!

22:24.306 --> 22:27.673
It's hard to figure out
what's more ill-fitting ...

22:27.776 --> 22:29.976
this suit or me as president.

22:31.313 --> 22:33.413
You know, I got to start
watching what I eat.

22:33.515 --> 22:36.249
I asked my insurance agent
where I could be buried.

22:36.351 --> 22:38.317
He started listing canyons.

22:38.420 --> 22:40.420
Canyons, folks.

22:40.522 --> 22:44.156
My kids are great. I mean,
they're not too bright, though.

22:44.258 --> 22:45.725
The other day, I caught Don Jr.

22:45.827 --> 22:48.027
trying to unwrap
a battery like a candy.

22:48.129 --> 22:51.142
And he's the smart one!

22:51.900 --> 22:54.300
But seriously, folks,
I got to tell you.

22:54.402 --> 22:56.701
Me and Jesus have a lot in common.

22:56.804 --> 22:59.004
He lugged around that huge cross.

22:59.106 --> 23:03.175
I got to lug around my huge ass.
Where's my holiday?

23:04.356 --> 23:06.511
So, yeah, I hate myself.

23:06.613 --> 23:08.414
Thank you!
That's my time.

23:10.818 --> 23:12.584
Oh, that's pretty funny stuff.

23:12.686 --> 23:14.920
<i>Not only was President Trump's</i>

23:15.021 --> 23:17.388
<i>White House
Correspondence Dinner speech</i>

23:17.491 --> 23:19.324
<i>popular with his detractors,</i>

23:19.426 --> 23:21.827
<i>it also received resounding praise</i>

23:21.929 --> 23:24.696
<i>from his supporters who claim
that Trump roasted himself</i>

23:24.798 --> 23:27.065
<i>far better than Obama ever did.</i>

23:27.167 --> 23:28.632
<i>When we come back, my face.</i>

23:28.734 --> 23:30.734
<i>Does it look the same upside-down?</i>

23:30.837 --> 23:32.070
Look, I got to tell you.

23:32.172 --> 23:35.006
I've never been more proud of
how proud you guys are of me.

23:35.108 --> 23:37.508
I'm proud of the work
we've done here today, Jared,

23:37.610 --> 23:39.844
and the unthinkable work
that is yet to come.

23:39.946 --> 23:41.312
Now, let's go get three beers.

23:41.414 --> 23:43.614
And I'm driving.
I want to plow into some deer.

23:43.716 --> 23:45.649
Hey, what was that
song about, anyway?

23:45.751 --> 23:46.851
Where do I begin?

23:46.953 --> 23:50.420
Okay, so, eugenics
is this emerging science.

23:50.523 --> 23:56.059
The audience loved you.
No one can humiliate you like yourself.

23:56.161 --> 23:58.863
It felt tremendous,
but who needs to roast Obama

23:58.965 --> 24:00.630
when I can melt your heart?

24:00.732 --> 24:03.033
Oh, no, Donald.
Please, don't sing song.
