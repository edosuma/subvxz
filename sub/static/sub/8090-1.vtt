Well, hold that down, baby.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.900
The girls look too choreographed.
Right.

20:51.900 --> 20:55.800
l can make 'em more freestyle, but
we gotta get 'em together eventually.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.200

22:36.200 --> 22:38.500
<i>Okay, so you're in a club.</i>

And the music's gonna come on.
And l'm gonna want you to move.

You sure you wanna spend

25:09.100 --> 25:11.000
Who's that?

25:11.100 --> 25:14.300

He's fine. Why you duckin'?

- Yeah. Shouldn't l get a check
or something for that?

26:39.100 --> 26:42.200
l haven't even got a check
for it yet. You here for the class?

26:42.400 --> 26:45.700
Yeah. Once Benny saw you
with Jadakiss,

26:45.800 --> 26:47.700
he said maybe
you were cool after all.

26:49.300 --> 26:51.900
Nah. l just figured you might
need some more moves to jack.

26:52.000 --> 26:56.500

Who, me? l wasn't gonna go.

27:14.600 --> 27:16.800
Go on, dog.
Go to your little class.

27:16.900 --> 27:18.900
l'm outta here.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.300
<i>Can we see this with playback?</i>

28:10.800 --> 28:13.200

28:42.400 --> 28:46.600

<i>Where we goin'tonight?</i>
Oh, l'm goin' to Papi Chulos.

28:50.500 --> 28:53.100
Oh, word? The gay club?
Shoot, l love the kids.

28:53.100 --> 28:56.400
But l didn't have to wear my heels
for that. l could have worn my sneakers.

28:56.500 --> 29:00.000
- Actually, l'm goin' with Michael.
- Oh, you can't bring me?

29:00.200 --> 29:05.300
lt's kind of a work thing.
You know, charity fund-raiser
with tickets and all.

29:05.400 --> 29:08.100
- Sorry.
<i>- Hmm.</i>

29:08.200 --> 29:11.800
- Sounds like somebody's trying
to dip their fingers in the Honey jar.
- Gina, he's my boss.

29:11.900 --> 29:14.000
You say that like you never heard
of Monica Lewinsky.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.400
lt's the video world.
You know, they do their
meet-and-greets at night in clubs.

29:18.400 --> 29:20.100
Oh, okay.

29:20.200 --> 29:24.700
Well, there's only one world--
the real world-- and in that world...

29:24.800 --> 29:28.500
if a man is taking a woman out
on a Friday night in her hooker heels...

29:28.600 --> 29:32.500
<i>and she can't bring her homegirl,</i>
<i>he tryin'to get some booty.</i>

All right, that's him.

29:37.300 --> 29:39.800
How do l look?

<i>Ten, ten, ten, ten. Ow.! Yes.!</i>

30:02.600 --> 30:05.500
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Come on up here.
How you doing, miss?

30:05.600 --> 30:08.000

Good to see you.

30:23.700 --> 30:27.100
Ginuwine, this is Honey.
How you doing?
Pleasure to meet you.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.800
Rodney, Honey.
What's up, man?
Nice to meet you.

30:31.900 --> 30:35.100
- Honey, from theJadakiss video, right?
- Yeah.

30:35.200 --> 30:38.200
l caught that.
You was doin' your thing in there.
You was real hot.

30:38.300 --> 30:41.300
- Thanks.
- l hear Mikey's gonna make you
super colossal.

30:41.500 --> 30:44.300
l thought l was making him
look good, but, you know.

30:44.400 --> 30:47.700
You hear that Mikey?
You got to watch her.
Better get them contracts tight.

30:47.800 --> 30:52.100
- So you gonna be in the next one, right?
- Oh, for sure, for sure.

30:52.100 --> 30:54.300
'Cause the next one gotta be crazy.

30:54.400 --> 30:57.700
No doubt, no doubt. That's why l got you
a new choreographer for this one.

30:57.800 --> 31:01.000
- For real? Who?
- This girl right here.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.100
<i>For real? l mean,</i>
<i>you ever done the wholejoint before?</i>

31:05.700 --> 31:08.000
No, but it's all right.
We got two more to do before yours.

31:08.100 --> 31:10.500
So she'll be a pro
by the time we get to you, you know.

31:10.600 --> 31:13.200
Right?
Right.

31:13.300 --> 31:17.000
Cool. Well, you know,
Mikey knows best,
you know what l'm saying?

31:17.100 --> 31:21.000
- Okay, sure.
- l don't know what to say.

31:21.100 --> 31:23.600
Thank you, Mikey.
You're the best.

31:23.700 --> 31:26.000
Thank you, Michael.
You're the best.

31:27.100 --> 31:30.800
- You better get them contracts tight now.

31:32.100 --> 31:35.500
Thank you.

31:48.900 --> 31:50.900
Raymond, is that you?
Honey!

31:52.800 --> 31:57.300
What are you doing out here?
My mama says l have to
do something with my hair.

31:57.300 --> 32:02.200
Your mama's right about that.
You wanna do this on your own,
or should l come with you?

32:02.300 --> 32:06.200
You can come with me.
Cool. So, what are you thinking?
Some braids?

32:06.300 --> 32:10.100
Snoop Doggy Dogg silky-fine
press and curl?

32:10.200 --> 32:13.100
Or maybe do like Mike
and shave it all off?

32:13.200 --> 32:15.800
Hmm, how 'bout braids?
Braids?

32:15.900 --> 32:18.000
All right, cool. Come on.

32:18.100 --> 32:21.200
Come on. They won't bite.

32:28.400 --> 32:31.900
Whoa. Look who's here.
l thought l was gonna have to
watch cable to see you again.

32:32.000 --> 32:36.300
Raymond needs a little trim
and some braids.

32:38.600 --> 32:42.400
Look, little guy.
You see that guy right there?

32:42.500 --> 32:45.400
<i>Yeah.</i>

32:45.500 --> 32:48.100
l know he has a stupid-looking face,
but what's his hair look like?

32:48.200 --> 32:51.700
All right.
Just all right or a little more
than all right?

32:54.100 --> 32:57.800
A little more.
That's right. And you know why?
'Cause he gets his hair cut by me.

32:57.800 --> 33:00.200
<i>l spent a whole 20 minutes on him.</i>

33:00.300 --> 33:04.400
l'm gonna send you over there
to Stacey to get braided up.

33:04.400 --> 33:07.700
<i>And when you're done,</i>
<i>l'm gonna spend 22 minutes on you.</i>

33:07.800 --> 33:09.700
Now how does that sound?

33:09.800 --> 33:11.800
That's cool.

33:11.800 --> 33:15.000
All right, now you just chill, shorty.
Don't worry about nothin'.

33:15.100 --> 33:17.300
Besides, l never mess up
a kid's head,

33:17.300 --> 33:19.400
especially when his mom's
in the shop.

33:19.500 --> 33:23.100
He's eight. That would have made me 1 4.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.400
- l'm not that kind of girl.
- My bad.

33:25.600 --> 33:27.700
We just peoples.

33:27.900 --> 33:29.700
Yeah, we peoples.
You peoples?

33:29.800 --> 33:33.500
Player, how'd you swing that?
l've been trying to be her peoples
for weeks. Ain't had no luck.

33:33.500 --> 33:36.500
- l got flow.

33:37.800 --> 33:41.600
- l got flow too.
You don't think l got some flow?
- Maybe not as much as me.

33:41.700 --> 33:45.400
Whoa. See, now you better
be careful, little man.

33:45.500 --> 33:49.900
You don't watch yourself,
l'm gonna have you runnin' out of here
lookin' like a poodle.

33:56.900 --> 33:59.700
All right, youngblood,
holler at your boy.

34:01.100 --> 34:03.400
lt's tight.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.800
Let me ask you something else.

34:05.800 --> 34:10.400
What if l was
to take Honey out to dinner?
You think that'd be tight too?

34:10.400 --> 34:12.800
That'd be all right.

34:12.900 --> 34:15.300
How's Friday?
Friday l'm working.

34:15.400 --> 34:20.400
Friday night?
These shoots go late. l never know
when l'm gonna get off.

34:20.500 --> 34:24.000
Saturday?
Saturday l'm workin' too.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.600
You're not working
all day Saturday.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.600
Listen, l'll tell you what.

34:29.699 --> 34:32.800
You find out when you're not working,
you get at me.

34:32.900 --> 34:37.000
l'm a busy woman.
l may never have the time.
Baby, that'd be a tragedy.

34:41.699 --> 34:43.800
All right, little cat.

34:43.900 --> 34:46.600
Come on.

34:51.800 --> 34:56.000
- Let us pray.

34:56.100 --> 34:59.200
Heavenly Father,

34:59.300 --> 35:01.100

35:04.700 --> 35:08.800
So when you gonna get picked up?

35:09.900 --> 35:11.900
But someone's comin', right?

35:11.900 --> 35:14.300
l don't know.

35:18.300 --> 35:21.300
Hey, l'm fiending for a milk shake.
Me too!

35:21.300 --> 35:25.100
Yeah? All right, then.
How 'bout we go get one,
and then you can show me where you live.

35:25.100 --> 35:28.000
Okay.
Cool. Come on.

35:43.200 --> 35:45.200
Do you live there?
Yes.

35:45.300 --> 35:47.300
Let's go.

36:04.700 --> 36:06.900
You gonna knock?

36:08.400 --> 36:10.600
You don't have to wait.

36:10.700 --> 36:14.200
Y'all, shut that noise up now!
Where you been?

36:14.300 --> 36:17.200

36:17.300 --> 36:21.200
- Who the hell are you?
- l'm his dance teacher.

36:21.200 --> 36:24.800
- Dance teacher?
<i>- Marisol, shut up</i>
<i>and close the damn door.!</i>

36:24.900 --> 36:28.800
Come on. Get on inside
before you piss him off.

36:30.100 --> 36:34.300
l just wanted to walk him home.
You know, tough world out there.

36:34.400 --> 36:37.500
Oh. Well, thank you
for letting me know that.

36:37.600 --> 36:41.600
You know, l would just love to spend
my day going here and there...

36:41.700 --> 36:43.800
with my kids instead of workin',

36:43.900 --> 36:48.100
which is what l've been doin'
for the last 1 2 hours!

37:25.400 --> 37:27.800
Five, six, seven, eight.

37:27.900 --> 37:30.200
One, two, three, four,

37:30.300 --> 37:32.500
five, six, seven, eight.

37:32.600 --> 37:34.700
One, two, three, four,

37:34.800 --> 37:37.700
<i>five, six, seven, eight.</i>

37:46.400 --> 37:48.400
Cut.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.600
<i>Cut.</i>

37:50.800 --> 37:55.300
<i>Uh, l want you two girls</i>
<i>to switch in the back.</i>

37:55.400 --> 37:58.900
You guys are great, though.
All right? You guys are really good.

38:08.200 --> 38:12.000
Um, there's somethin' missing.

38:12.100 --> 38:14.400
What?

38:15.700 --> 38:18.800
l don't know. Somethin'.

38:22.600 --> 38:24.800
Fix it.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.900
Okay.

38:30.200 --> 38:32.100
Go to lunch.

38:32.300 --> 38:35.500
What?
All right.

38:40.400 --> 38:43.600
Come on, man.
Don't be a hog, yo.
Hold that right there.

38:43.700 --> 38:47.100
<i>Lay up, man. What up? Lay up.</i>

38:49.000 --> 38:51.600
Son, take your game home.
Oh!

38:59.200 --> 39:00.900
D. up.

41:03.300 --> 41:06.100
<i>Rise and shine, sleepy head.</i>

41:06.100 --> 41:08.200
What are you doing?

41:08.300 --> 41:11.700
Gettin' you up. lt's Sunday.
So?

41:11.800 --> 41:14.400
So? We gonna get
my birthday dress today. You forgot?

41:14.500 --> 41:17.200
No, it's just--
<i>What are you doing in bed</i>
<i>in the middle of the day?</i>

41:17.300 --> 41:20.400
l didn't get home till 6:00.

41:20.500 --> 41:23.300
You work until 6:00 in the morning?
l hope you gettin' overtime.

41:23.400 --> 41:28.000
- Girl, l'm dead.
- l don't care if you're cold and buried.
l got off work special for this.

41:28.100 --> 41:31.800
So, get up! Come on. Get up!

41:31.900 --> 41:34.300
<i>We gotta get ready for Atlantic City.</i>
Gina.

41:34.400 --> 41:36.600
Oh, look. Take this.

41:36.700 --> 41:40.200
What? What's that?

41:44.400 --> 41:47.100
<i>Ooh, Dolce.</i>

41:47.200 --> 41:49.100
Stop.
<i>Do you like?</i>

41:49.200 --> 41:52.700
Ay, <i>que linda, mami.</i>
l love it.

41:52.800 --> 41:54.900
What kind of money you makin'?

41:54.900 --> 41:58.800
Oh, l didn't pay for it.
l got it for free at the shoot.

41:58.900 --> 42:02.800
You givin' me some sweaty leftovers
instead of taking me shopping
like a real friend?

42:04.100 --> 42:07.700
lt's not sweaty leftovers.
lt's brand-new.
lt's still got a tag on it.

42:07.800 --> 42:10.100
Hmm.
l thought you'd like it.

42:10.200 --> 42:15.000
Look at Miss Thing.
Too ''bougie'' to shop at the bargain stores.
lt's not even like that.

42:15.100 --> 42:18.700
No, it's cool. lf you don't wanna go
shopping with me, l'll go by myself.

42:18.800 --> 42:22.800
<i>- Only person l can depend on anyway.</i>
- Gina.

42:24.300 --> 42:27.100
Oh, God.

42:40.400 --> 42:43.300
Thank you.

42:50.600 --> 42:53.500
Hey, Raymond. What's up?

42:54.500 --> 42:57.500
Benny ain't been in school.

42:57.500 --> 42:59.900
Well, where is he at?

43:00.000 --> 43:03.800
Mama's boyfriend got
all into it with him.
Busted Benny's lip.

43:06.800 --> 43:10.700
- Has he ever hit you?
- Not me.

43:12.200 --> 43:15.100
Okay. Come on. Let's go find him.

43:15.200 --> 43:17.300
Okay?
Okay.

43:17.400 --> 43:19.700
Come on.

44:25.100 --> 44:29.100
Hey, Benny. We've been
lookin' for you all over.

44:29.200 --> 44:31.400
Don't. l don't need your help.

44:31.600 --> 44:34.400
Let me handle it.
You shouldn't have to handle it.

44:37.100 --> 44:39.600
You guys can't go back
to that apartment for a while.

44:39.700 --> 44:42.500
We can go to my UncleJessie's.
<i>All right.</i>

44:42.600 --> 44:44.600
l'll take you over there, okay?

44:44.700 --> 44:48.900
- What do you care?
- l care because you're a good kid.

44:48.900 --> 44:51.000
So? lt's not like you're around.

44:51.100 --> 44:54.500
Don't even teach anymore.
Why don't you just roll out?

44:58.300 --> 45:00.600
Huh.

45:00.700 --> 45:04.400
Then l guess l'm just gonna have
to find someone else to help me out
with Tweet's video then.

45:04.500 --> 45:07.500
<i>Tweet? The Tweet?</i>

45:07.600 --> 45:11.200
l'm doin' the choreography
for her video next week,

45:11.300 --> 45:14.500
and, you know, l could use
some help in the afternoons
and the evenings.

45:14.500 --> 45:18.200
But if you don't wanna kick it,
'cause, you know--
l could come. No joke?

45:18.300 --> 45:23.300
No joke. lf you get your butt
to school every day, yes, l promise.

45:23.400 --> 45:25.400
Promises don't mean nothin'.

45:25.500 --> 45:27.800
Mine do.

45:37.800 --> 45:40.800
<i>All right, girls,you ready?</i>

45:40.900 --> 45:43.300
Set? Okay.

45:43.400 --> 45:46.300
Five, six, seven. Fly!

45:46.400 --> 45:48.800
One, two, three. Fly!

45:48.900 --> 45:51.400
<i>Go down. Think dancer.</i>

45:51.500 --> 45:54.900
- Okay.
- And just work your arms, okay?

45:55.000 --> 45:58.200
And once you land, plié.
Give a sexy pose.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.300
Thanks, guys.

46:04.400 --> 46:07.400
Okay. All right. Ready?

46:10.900 --> 46:13.100
Tweet, you look great.
Thank you.

46:13.300 --> 46:18.000
- Okay, let's try this.
- You takin' notes for me?

46:18.100 --> 46:21.800
You're gonna get fired
if you're not takin' notes. Security.

46:21.800 --> 46:24.300
Oh, he's just playin'.

47:18.700 --> 47:21.600
Michael, thank you so much.

47:23.800 --> 47:26.100
l can do that. You know l can do that.

47:27.100 --> 47:29.400
Maybe you will someday.

47:29.500 --> 47:33.300
Look, yo. There's people
that good things happen to.

47:33.300 --> 47:36.600
And there's people that
good things don't happen to.
That's just the way it goes.

47:42.100 --> 47:45.300
The gods made no mistakes
when they created their--
<i>So what are they?</i>

47:45.300 --> 47:47.300
Fresh Air Fund kids or something?

47:47.400 --> 47:50.800
Fresh air?
Michael, this is New York.

47:50.900 --> 47:53.300
l, uh-- l taught them at the center.

47:53.400 --> 47:55.000
ln fact, uh,

47:55.100 --> 47:58.100
seeing them on the set there today
gave me an idea for Ginuwine's video.

47:58.100 --> 48:00.300
What are you thinking?
Okay.

48:00.400 --> 48:03.700
New York, the hood.
Ginuwine's doing his thing.

48:03.700 --> 48:08.100
But instead of the usual hoochies,
you get a posse of kids, dancers.

48:08.200 --> 48:10.600
They bust out, all G'd up,
just like Ginuwine--

48:10.700 --> 48:12.800
same hair, same bling.
Like a--

48:12.900 --> 48:16.400
- Like a hip-hop pied piper?
- Right.

48:17.900 --> 48:20.600
l like it.
Really?

48:20.700 --> 48:22.600
Yeah.

48:22.700 --> 48:25.900
l'll pitch it to him.
Cool, cool.

48:26.000 --> 48:29.100
You know, if he goes for it,
l'd like to audition my kids.
Oh, l see.

48:29.200 --> 48:31.700
You just wanna get those
Fresh Air Fund kids into show biz.

48:31.900 --> 48:33.800
That's not true.

48:33.900 --> 48:36.900
Their flavor's hot. You know.

48:37.000 --> 48:40.100
lf it gets a couple of them
off the street, so much the better.

48:42.200 --> 48:45.700
All right, guys.
Let's do it one more time,
but clean it up. One, two,

48:45.800 --> 48:50.000
three, four, five and six
and seven, eight.

48:50.100 --> 48:53.400
<i>Oh, hold on. Hold on.</i>
<i>Look who's here.</i>

48:53.400 --> 48:56.800
<i>Honey, what's up, girl?</i>

48:58.300 --> 49:00.300
<i>Hey, guys.</i>
<i>l got a surprise for you.</i>

49:12.400 --> 49:15.100
Which one of you
can tell me who that is?

49:15.100 --> 49:19.200
- Ginuwine.
- So which one of you
wants to audition for his video?

49:19.300 --> 49:20.800
What video?

49:20.900 --> 49:24.400
Open calls are in two weeks, and l'll
rehearse with anybody who's up to it.

49:24.400 --> 49:27.700
<i>- So which one of you wants</i>
<i>to audition for Ginuwine's video?</i>

49:27.800 --> 49:30.000
All right.

49:46.600 --> 49:49.400
Can l help you?
You're the dance teacher, right?

49:50.500 --> 49:53.900
l'm Otis's brother.
You're the one his little man's
been hanging out with, right?

49:53.900 --> 49:55.700
You mean Benny?
Yeah, Benny.

49:55.800 --> 50:00.100
We ain't seen Benny around
in a while and we miss him.
He's been busy.

50:00.200 --> 50:04.000
Check this out. He's part of my crew.

50:04.100 --> 50:06.100
And when you're in my crew,
you don't mess with other shit.

50:06.300 --> 50:09.800
So you tell him l'm looking for him.
l'm not gonna do that.

50:09.900 --> 50:11.800
What?

50:12.900 --> 50:14.800
Why not?

50:14.900 --> 50:19.400
- l asked you a question!
<i>- Yo, Honey. Hey.</i>

50:19.500 --> 50:24.700
B.B., what's poppin'?
Am l interrupting?
Well, if it ain't Floyd the Barber.

50:24.800 --> 50:29.000
How are things in that cute
little barbershop of yours, B.?

50:29.100 --> 50:31.600
You making ends meet?
Oh, you know.
l'm definitely doing me.

50:31.700 --> 50:33.600
Getting this paper.
''Getting this paper.''

50:33.700 --> 50:37.300
Check this out. When you're tired of
nickel-and-diming,just give me a holler.

50:37.400 --> 50:39.400
l'm gonna hook you up.

50:39.400 --> 50:44.900
Well, you ever get tired
of wearin' those bum-ass do-rags,
you give me a holler. l'll hook you up.

50:48.700 --> 50:50.800
l wanna see that kid.

50:57.500 --> 51:00.700
You okay?
Yeah, l'm cool.

51:00.800 --> 51:02.900
What was that all about?
How did you get on B.B.'s bad side?

51:02.900 --> 51:05.300
l made the wrong friend, l guess.

51:05.400 --> 51:07.700
Well, you know,
you should stay away from him.

51:07.700 --> 51:10.100
He's dangerous. Seriously.

51:10.200 --> 51:15.200
Yeah. Thinking of picking up some
pepper spray tomorrow or something.

51:28.700 --> 51:31.400
Did l say thank you?

51:31.500 --> 51:34.500
You sure you don't want me to walk you
upstairs and make sure you're safe?

51:34.600 --> 51:37.100
No. l can handle myself.

51:37.200 --> 51:40.500
Thanks again.

51:47.700 --> 51:50.200
Uh--

51:51.200 --> 51:54.000
Bye.

52:04.400 --> 52:06.000
Come on.

52:14.400 --> 52:18.400
Mom, what happened?
Another pipe burst.
You can't be in here.

52:18.500 --> 52:24.000
How long will it take to fix?
Oh, who knows?
Building codes, inspections.

52:24.100 --> 52:27.400
Now the city wants to do a full
assessment, see if the building's
even worth reopening.

52:27.500 --> 52:30.300
Ma, you can't let them shut you down.
<i>Honey,</i>

52:30.400 --> 52:35.100
your telling me what l can and cannot do
is not gonna improve my mood right now.

52:38.000 --> 52:42.700
l don't know what to do about this.
lf there's a danger to the kids--

52:42.800 --> 52:46.600
He's one of those kids,
you know, trying to act all bad.

52:46.600 --> 52:49.900
But 10 seconds into a routine,
l catch a glimpse of him.

52:50.100 --> 52:53.000
lt's like l can just see
this light shining out of him.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.300
He's a kid again.
Yeah.

52:55.400 --> 52:58.100
lt's the best feeling l know seeing that.

52:58.200 --> 53:00.100
lt's scary though.

53:00.200 --> 53:03.800
'Cause when l think of him hanging out
with B.B., it's like l can watch that light
get dimmer and dimmer.

53:03.900 --> 53:06.300
Well, you know, when a thug joint's
the hottest spot in the hood,

53:06.300 --> 53:08.500
it's hard for a kid
not to want to be down.

53:08.600 --> 53:11.700
l know. l'm over here.

53:11.700 --> 53:13.800
Nah, nah, nah.
l wanna show you something.

53:13.800 --> 53:16.700
All right.
All right, sexy?

53:18.100 --> 53:20.000
Stop with that.

53:27.600 --> 53:30.500
<i>You know, most of the kids</i>
<i>l came up with werejust like that.</i>

53:30.500 --> 53:33.000
<i>Trying to be thugged out,</i>
<i>and wanting to fit in.</i>

53:33.100 --> 53:35.200
<i>'Cause that's what</i>
<i>everybody else was doing.</i>

53:35.200 --> 53:38.000
<i>Where are they now,jail?</i>

53:38.000 --> 53:43.200
<i>Most of them, or headed</i>
<i>that way like B.B., or dead.</i>

53:43.300 --> 53:45.200
Listen, this is bad date talk.

53:45.300 --> 53:48.700
We should change the subject.
What's your favorite color?

53:48.800 --> 53:50.700
How come you turned out so good?

53:50.800 --> 53:53.200
She thinks l turned out good.

53:53.300 --> 53:57.000
l'm serious.
l don't know. l got lucky.

53:57.100 --> 53:59.500
What happened?

54:00.600 --> 54:04.800
Well, the guy that used to own this shop
lived right next door to me and my mom.

54:04.900 --> 54:07.900
<i>And when he saw me</i>
<i>get into some bad things,</i>

54:08.000 --> 54:10.800
he gave me a job here
sweeping up the floors.

54:10.900 --> 54:12.800
lt's crazy 'cause
he couldn't even afford it.

54:12.900 --> 54:14.800
He paid me right
out of his own pocket.

54:14.900 --> 54:17.200
l worked for him for 1 0 years.

54:17.300 --> 54:20.900
And when he passed,
he left this place to me.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.800
<i>See, B.B. likes to talk shit</i>
<i>like l'm the one that's losing,</i>

54:24.800 --> 54:26.800
like l'm missing something
out there on the streets,

54:26.900 --> 54:28.900
but he and l both know who's winning.

54:29.000 --> 54:32.900
l've found something that l truly love,
that truly makes me happy.

54:33.100 --> 54:36.600
<i>And that's a million times better than</i>
<i>finding something that makes you rich.</i>

54:37.800 --> 54:41.300
So, it's just someone believing in you.

54:42.600 --> 54:47.200
Well, that and having a place to go
where l could stay out of trouble, yeah.

54:52.700 --> 54:54.400
What?

54:54.400 --> 54:57.600
Nothing.Just thinking.

54:57.700 --> 54:59.700
About what?

54:59.800 --> 55:02.400
About what makes me happy.

55:07.400 --> 55:11.900
Well, you know, l would
really love to be a part of that.
What?

55:12.000 --> 55:15.400
Making you happy.

56:08.700 --> 56:10.700
477 Castle Hill Avenue...

56:10.800 --> 56:15.500
will go for about $170,000.

56:15.600 --> 56:17.600
So 17 down?

56:17.700 --> 56:21.100
Seventeen thousand down, yes. ln cash.

56:25.100 --> 56:27.800
How about l give you
half the down payment now,

56:27.800 --> 56:30.300
and you give me 30 days
to come up with the rest?

56:30.400 --> 56:32.900
lf l don't, you put it back
on the market.

56:32.900 --> 56:34.900
Why do you even want this property?

56:34.900 --> 56:37.200
lt's just an empty storefront
on a bad block.

56:37.200 --> 56:39.700
lt's perfect for a dance studio.

56:41.200 --> 56:43.700
Maybe even a dance school
for the whole neighborhood.

56:45.300 --> 56:48.300
- So am l writing a check or not?
- By all means.

56:51.500 --> 56:53.800
<i>Five, six, seven, eight.</i>

57:15.500 --> 57:18.700
- Cut.

57:24.400 --> 57:27.200
You have no idea
what this means to them.
Oh, sure, l do.

57:27.200 --> 57:29.000
l had a first job too once.

57:30.700 --> 57:33.400
Oh, uh, we have a meeting later.

57:33.500 --> 57:39.000
With who?
Uh, it's, uh, the big guys.

57:39.100 --> 57:42.800
Downtown. l'll pick you up.
We'll go together.

57:44.200 --> 57:46.800
l can't. l'm going to Atlantic City.

57:46.800 --> 57:50.500
No, you are not. Absolutely not.

57:50.600 --> 57:54.100
You gotta be there, Honey.
l'm gonna pick you up around 5:00.

57:54.200 --> 57:58.200
<i>l know. l gotta go to some</i>
<i>wack meeting instead of A.C.</i>

58:01.300 --> 58:04.200
lt's boss man.

58:04.300 --> 58:06.600
Well, you girls have
a good time, okay, Gina?

58:06.600 --> 58:08.800
Who is it?
lt's Michael. Let me up.

58:13.400 --> 58:15.900
All right. l gotta go.

58:15.900 --> 58:18.800
You wild out.
Tear that place up. Okay.

58:25.700 --> 58:27.600
Hey.
Hey, sweetie.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Oh, this is--

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Well, this is where you live here.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.200
What's with the threads?

58:38.000 --> 58:43.600
Q. Walker's black-and-white party?
Yeah, that's the shit right there.
That's the biggest party of the year.

58:43.600 --> 58:46.300
<i>Got anyjuice?</i>
l thought we were going to a meeting.

58:46.400 --> 58:49.200
Business and pleasure
are the same thing.
You know that, Honey.

58:51.100 --> 58:54.900
lf l knew it was a party,
l wouldn't have canceled
on my best friend's birthday.

58:54.900 --> 58:57.100
<i>You would rather go to Atlantic City,</i>

58:57.200 --> 59:00.800
which will always be there,
with friends you always see,

59:00.900 --> 59:03.900
instead of going to
the hottest party in town with me?

59:05.700 --> 59:08.000
Look.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.100
Everybody is gonna be there.

59:10.100 --> 59:13.300
All right? Artists, producers,
other choreographers.

59:13.400 --> 59:15.700
lt would be career suicide
if you didn't go.

59:18.400 --> 59:21.000
All right. Change into that,

59:21.100 --> 59:23.400
and, uh, l'll meet you downstairs.

59:23.500 --> 59:25.400
Okay?

59:25.500 --> 59:27.200
Okay.

59:55.200 --> 59:58.300
Hey, uh, can l use your phone?

59:58.400 --> 01:00:01.200
Yeah, yeah. Hold on.

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:04.800
l'm gonna go upstairs
and find a quiet room, so--

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:08.000
You heard her, B.
She's gonna find a quiet room upstairs.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:18.700
<i>Remember, stake if it's 16.</i>
<i>lf it's less, hit or something like that.</i>

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:22.300
All right. Well, uh, l miss you.

01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:26.200
Happy birthday.

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:28.300
<i>This is a nice crib, huh?</i>

01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:31.200
Oh. Hey, Michael.
You scared me.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:34.700
- What are you doing?
- l'm just looking.

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:38.200
- At the house?

01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:41.100
No, l'm looking at you.

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:46.700
That's the cognac speaking.
Here. Thanks.

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:51.400
You know, the first time
l ever saw you, l said to myself,

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.400
''That girl is so fine.''

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:56.500
Quit playin'.
Who's playing? l'm not playing.

01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:58.400
No, seriously.
No, seriously.

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:01.200
Come on. Stop. Stop! Stop!

01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:03.500
Get off of me.

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:11.700
Bitch, how you gonna
play me like that?

01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:17.100
Oh. Oh, l see. l see.
You're one of those.

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:20.500
l'm not one of anything.
l'm just not up for this.

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:25.100
<i>What about, ''l owe you so much, Michael''?</i>
<i>''You're the best thing that ever</i>
<i>happened to me, Michael. ''</i>

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:27.400
Professionally, yeah.

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:33.600
All right. That was all talk.
That was all talk, right?

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:39.400
Just so you could get ahead in life?
No, no, stay. Don't leave.

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:41.700
You made it. You're here. Stay.

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:45.700
Look, it's a fancy party.
You came in a fancy car.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.800
You're drunk.

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.800
l'm gonna do you a favor.

01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:59.800
l'm gonna pretend like
none of this happened.

01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:01.900
<i>See you on Monday.</i>

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:10.100
- One and two, three and four.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:12.400
<i>Five, six, nice.</i>

01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:21.000
<i>Okay, Ginuwine,</i>
<i>come through.</i>

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:23.300
<i>Okay, Raymond.</i>

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.700
<i>Shaker boys, in front.</i>

01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:32.700
Come on, shake it up.

01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:37.800
<i>Go, shake it. Come on.</i>

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:40.100
<i>Come on. Shake it good, boys.</i>

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:44.200
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:49.200
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:51.400
Oh!

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.700
That was great.
You guys were terrific.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:01.700
l'm lovin' it.
Hey, hey, yo!

01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:04.000
Good job!

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:06.300
That was hot.
Where is he?

01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:08.300
l don't know.
Ginuwine!

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:21.200
We're ready for a rehearsal, sir.

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:32.100
<i>lt's all set for you.</i>
<i>Hey, Mike.</i>
Hi, how you doin'?

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:35.500
Hold that for a while.
All right, let's see this.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:38.700
<i>Playback.!</i>
All right, guys.
Just like we rehearsed.

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:42.100
- Five, six, seven, eight.

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:46.300
Cut. Cut! Cut.

01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:50.000
Go get the car or something.

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:58.200
Nah, it's not--
it's not working.
Which part?

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:00.900
<i>The whole part.</i>
<i>The whole kid thing.</i>

01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:03.000
lt's horrible.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.900
No, Michael. Don't do this.

01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:12.300
l was thinking l wanted
to make it a little more sexy,
you know. A little more real.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:15.100
What's more real than these kids?

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.100
<i>Oh, no.</i>

01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:24.500
Michael, don't do this.

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:28.500
lf you want to get back at me, do that,
but don't take it out on these kids.
Katrina, baby.

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:32.400
Hey.

01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:36.900
- All right, now l'm gonna
give you some music.
<i>- Okay.</i>

01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:39.800
And l want you
to listen and then move.
Got you.

01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:43.000
Go do your thing.

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:49.100
Do not take away the one thing
they have to be excited about.

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:52.500
Look. l have a lot
to do today, all right?

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:54.500
So if you want to get paid,

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:58.500
pack up your shit and take
your little friends out of here.

01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:05.200
l want you to fire 'em. l want you
to tell them why you're not using 'em.

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:07.900
What's going on?
Don't worry about it.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.300
What makes you think
l care what you want?

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:15.300
<i>Yeah, the label called.</i>
<i>They're not into the kid thing at all.</i>

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:17.700
<i>For real? Aw, man. All right.</i>

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:27.100
- l'm so sorry.
- So it's not gonna happen?

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:30.100
<i>No. He changed his mind</i>
<i>about what he wants.</i>

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:33.800
- Why?
-Just because.

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:37.100
- You made him mad, didn't you?
- Not intentionally.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:40.200
<i>Look,you guys.</i>
<i>There will be other opportunities.</i>

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:43.800
No, there won't. Let's go, y'all.
This is wack.

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:15.800
Oh, you're funny, right? Okay.

01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:18.400
What happened
to your big dance career?

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:22.500
lt's weak, man.
Thug life, baby.

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.700
Yo.
That's what it is.

01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:28.500
l like those.

01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:32.600
Yo. Go cop those for me, man.

01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:03.200
Let's move. Come on, go.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.700
<i>Come on, ladies. Let me see it.</i>

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:13.700
<i>Five, six, seven, eight. Turn.</i>

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:20.300
<i>Front. Back.</i>
lf that's the girl we heard about,
then no way.

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:31.800
l can't get a job anywhere.
Michael's blackballing me.
You sure about that?

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:34.700
Yeah, and all he has to do is mention
he doesn't want me working.

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.100
What kind of clown would do that,
stop somebody from earning a living?

01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:40.800
l guess he figures since he gave me
my career, he can take it away.

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:43.000
Hey. He didn't give you anything.

01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:47.600
You get hired because you've got drive,
talent and love for what you do.

01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:51.000
That's a gift from God,
not some video director.

01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:54.100
The thing is,
l was counting on that money.

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:56.200
Not for me, for the kids.

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:59.600
That studio could be unbelievable.

01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:01.500
lt could change their life.

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:51.399
Hmm, paying off that balance?

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:57.399
Actually, l came for an extension.
l need more time.
How much?

01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:02.800
l don't know.
l sort of hit a financial snag.
Miss Daniels,

01:09:02.899 --> 01:09:04.899
if l could help you, l would.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.300
But l've already agreed to keep
this property off the market
for two full weeks for you.

01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:11.700
That's the best l can do.

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:20.800
l know it's a lot of money.
l'm sorry, Honey.
We just don't have it.

01:09:20.899 --> 01:09:23.100
And even if we did--
Evelyn, don't.

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.700
Even if you did what, Ma?

01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:28.700
Honey, a commitment like that,

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:31.600
you take that on, you are
gonna be stuck here forever.

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:33.800
You'll never leave.

01:09:33.899 --> 01:09:37.600
Oh, l forgot. l'm supposed to see
all the beautiful things in this world.

01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:41.300
Well, there's nothing wrong
with my wanting that for you.

01:09:41.399 --> 01:09:43.399
No, but what about what l want?

01:09:43.399 --> 01:09:46.899
You're 22 years old.
You don't know what you want.

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:52.200
You know what l see
living in this neighborhood?

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:55.900
l see kids go from bad homes
to bad schools and back again.

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:59.600
And l've seen you unlock a door to
a place where those kids can feel safe.

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:06.900
Maybe l'm dumb because l haven't
been to Paris or Milan or wherever,

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.600
but to me,

01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:12.800
it doesn't get much better than that.

01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:00.100
<i>lt was everything l always wanted.</i>

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:04.200
But when l had got it,
it felt like nothing, less than nothing.

01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:08.300
And now losing it feels even worse.

01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:11.700
l'm not looking for sympathy.

01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:14.300
l just need someone to talk to,

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:16.900
someone l know and trust.

01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:21.400
l'm so sorry, Gina.
l totally let you down.

01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:24.800
Do you think you could
ever trust me again?

01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:28.300
l don't know.

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:30.200
<i>Maybe.</i>

01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:34.200
You're my girl.

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:38.500
You know the first thing l thought
when l saw that picture in the paper?

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:41.600
- That hood rat lied to me.
- No, that was the second.

01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:45.000
- That hood rat
skipped out on my birthday.
- No, that was the third.

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:47.100
What was the first?

01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:51.300
That hood rat went
to the black-and-white party
and she did not bring me.

01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:57.200
<i>l know you're in a jam right now,</i>
<i>but, Honey,you got skills.</i>

01:11:57.300 --> 01:11:59.400
<i>And that's gonna take you places.</i>

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:01.300
l just thought that, you know,

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:03.400
being your girl and all,
l'd get to go too.

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:05.800
You can.
No, l can't.

01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:10.300
l'm just your friend.
You're the one with the goods.

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.900
<i>You're the one that people want.</i>
<i>You don't need me.</i>

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.300
<i>You just need to trust</i>
<i>and believe in yourself.</i>

01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:19.300
Like l do.

01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:28.000
Come here.

01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:37.000
Don't worry, baby,
you'll find work real soon.
You're too good not to get hired.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
All right?

01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:42.400
l just don't have the time
to wait for people to wake up to that.

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:44.500
l'm gonna lose the building
at the end of the month.

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:49.900
lf l can't earn it, and l can't
borrow it, and l can't steal it,

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:55.200
l could raise it.
What do you mean?

01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:57.900
Well, l'm trying to get
a space for kids, right?

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.400
lf people knew about it,
they'd want to help, wouldn't they?
Yeah, probably.

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:03.400
l could put on
a benefit performance.

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:06.100
Charge a cover.
Get some donated food.

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:10.100
Put on a great show. l could do that.
Why couldn't l do that?

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:14.400
'Cause l don't have a space,
that's why. Damn it!

01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:16.700
Come here, <i>mami.</i> l got an idea.

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:19.600
That's love. Nah, baby,
l got you on my Christmas list.

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.700
All right? One, one.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.600
lt's just off the B.Q.E.
lt used to be a church.

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:29.100
The cat l was just on the phone with,
he used to own it.

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:32.600
But in three weeks they're converting it
to office space, so it's empty now.

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:34.700
lf you want it, you better jump on it.

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:36.700
What's it like?

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:38.700
lt's dirty. lt's old.

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:41.500
But it has a floor, right?
Yeah.

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:44.300
l'll take it. Thank you.

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:58.200
Hey, guys.
Hi, Honey. What's up?

01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:01.900
l know what you're thinking,
''What the hell we doing here?''
Don't worry, it's temporary.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.100
This is what we call a means to an end.

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:07.600
Nobody's gonna give us a space,
that much is clear.

01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:11.000
So we're gonna raise the money
and buy it, straight up and legal.

01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:13.100
Y'all ever heard of a benefit performance?

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:16.500
- What do you mean? LikeJerry Lewis?
<i>- Sort of.</i>

01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:19.100
l'm Jerry. You're the kids.
Let's get to work.

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.400
Orange. Good color for you.

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:06.100
<i>l spoke to your moms.</i>
<i>She said you're getting out tomorrow.</i>

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:08.100
That's right.

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:10.400
When you do,
l want you to come hang with me.

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:13.600
Nah.

01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:16.100
You could have a good life, Benny.
lt doesn't have to be like this.

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:20.200
What do you know?
You ain't got no job.
You ain't got no money.

01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:24.100
- Matter of fact, you ain't got nothing.
- What l got is a clear conscience.

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:26.100
Yeah? What you gonna buy with that?

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:29.100
lt breaks my heart seeing you
selling yourself short like this.

01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:31.400
So leave. Get.

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:38.000
Let me ask you something.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.100
You know your homies,
those guys that got your back?

01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:45.800
- Yeah?
- How many times they come to visit you?

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:51.500
You think about that.

01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:59.100
l don't know
if this is gonna work, Missy.

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:02.400
But, uh, nah, Katrina's gonna make this
so sexy, it's not gonna matter.

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:06.100
Katrina?
Who the hell is Katrina?

01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:08.300
- That's Katrina.
- Hey.

01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:12.400
Katrina is the shit.
She just did Ginuwine's new video.

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:15.100
l don't care if she just showed
MichaelJackson how to Harlem shake.

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:18.900
l said l want Honey.
Honey Daniels. Duh.

01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:21.700
<i>Let's just try it once.</i>
<i>And if you like it, we keep it.</i>

01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:24.300
lf not, then we fix it.
So there's no problem.

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:26.400
Let me see what you got.
What you gonna do?

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:29.400
l was thinking something a little more
sexy, maybe in the hips. Lenny.

01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:45.300
- No. No, no, no.

01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:50.700
What is this, this?

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:54.400
Look, let me tell you something.
l don't backup dance for Heather Hunter.

01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:58.200
l don't know what kind of
pornography y'all got going on here.
This has gotta be a joke.

01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:00.800
Anyway, when you get in touch
with Honey Daniels, you call me.

01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:05.100
You, you need to call M.C. Hammer,
let him know you're stealing his stuff.

01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:08.500
<i>Y'all two crazy people in here.</i>
<i>Give me my phone.</i>

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:11.100
<i>Don't make no sense.</i>
<i>That's ridiculous.</i>

01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.800
Missy, hold up. l got an idea.

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:20.300
Honey, what you been up to?

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:22.500
Bye, Michael.
Wait, come on.
Honey, come on.

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:25.200
Hold on. l came to apologize.
l'm not interested.

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:27.000
Give me a break.

01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:30.100
What l did,

01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:34.800
the way l handled things
was uncool, and l am so sorry.

01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:36.900
Hey, and l want
to make it up to you.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.900
ls that so?

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.100
l've got you three new jobs.

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:43.900
And you want me to do the choreography?

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
l am begging you.

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:51.000
Oh, l get it.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.000
The artist asked for me, and
if you don't deliver, they're walkin'.

01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:56.300
Am l right?

01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:59.500
They want you, sure.
But so do l.

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:02.800
Michael, you got yourself
in such a bind.

01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:04.800
Good luck getting out of it.

01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:09.400
l'll pay. You know l got the money.

01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:11.700
l don't want your money.

01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:14.700
Are you sure?
You sure about that?

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:20.200
Because, uh, l could buy you
a little dance studio.

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:23.500
What about that? What about
you come back to work for me,

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:25.400
and l'll get you this.

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:29.700
You know what's funny?

01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:34.400
When l first met you,
you were 1 0 feet tall.

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:38.700
And now l look at you,
you're this big.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.200
l don't need your help. l'm gonna get
that dance studio on my own.

01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:48.600
<i>Five, six, seven, eight.</i>

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:53.700
Hey.

01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:59.000
- So you came.
- l had to.

01:19:59.100 --> 01:20:02.500
l can't let these bustas get
in front of an audience doin' no--

01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:05.700
- That's wack.
- ls that so?

01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:09.600
<i>l'm gonna give you something better.</i>
<i>'Cause it breaks my heart to see you</i>
<i>selling yourself short.</i>

01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:11.800
<i>Oh.</i>

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.400
- Let's see you bust.
- Let's do this.

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:16.800
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.200
So you pick that up in juvie?

01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:30.400
That's right. l believe in making
every experience educational.

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.700
All right, guys, let's clump it up.

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:36.700
We only got a few rehearsal days left.

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:38.900
Let's make it count.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.700
Music.
Okay.

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:44.100
- Count 'em in.

01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:48.600
Five, six. Five, six, seven, eight.

01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:54.900
Good.

01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:57.400
Nice.

01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:59.700
One more time.
Keep it tight, okay?

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:20.500
<i>Can you see the stage all right?</i>
<i>Yeah? Okay.</i>

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:24.900
Hey, <i>chica.</i>

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.600
Gina.

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:29.200
Oh, you know my homegirl
Mrs. Strom, right?

01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:32.600
Your friend came by the bank and
told me what you're trying to do here.

01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:36.300
l do banking for some
nonprofit arts foundations.

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:39.000
- l know some people.
- Some rich people.

01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:43.600
Some people who would find
the opportunity of funding
a project like yours very interesting.

01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:46.900
Are you serious?
l've invited them tonight.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.400
Oh, my goodness.
Thank you so much.

01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:53.300
Don't thank me yet.Just go out
there and put on a good show.

01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:57.000
How am l supposed to know
if l'm dressed right if you won't
tell me where we're going?

01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:59.200
What you're wearing is fine.

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:02.200
Are you sure?
l'm sure we're late.

01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:04.200
Where are we going?
l'm not telling.

01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:07.300
You better tell me something.
l'm not telling.

01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:12.600
Here you go.

01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:14.900
Does the set look okay?
Yeah, it's cool.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:19.800
l don't know. l feel like
l should've had brighter lights,
or a different backdrop, or colors.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.500
l don't know. Here.

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:26.900
Yo, Honey. lt's good.
Just chill out. We got your back.

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:30.900
Now get out of here.
We got a show to do.

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.300
Wow.

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:49.500
You have no idea
how beautiful y'all look.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>

01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:55.100
This means a lot to me.

01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:57.100
This means a lot to all of us.

01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:02.800
These kids are good kids,
and, man, do they love to dance.

01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:07.600
Dancing isn't what they do,
it's who they are.

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:12.100
And you coming here tonight
says you wanna get to know 'em.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
That means more
than you could imagine.

01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:20.000
<i>So, thanks again.</i>

01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:22.000
Peace.

01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:24.700
<i>And l hope you like it.</i>

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:36.500
That was beautiful, baby.

01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:19.500
Encore, encore!

01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:33.700
- Beautiful, beautiful.
- Come on.

01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:37.500
Honey, Honey, Honey!

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.400

<i>Man, open this damn door.</i>
<i>Open the door. l'm late.</i>

01:28:40.300 --> 01:28:42.300
<i>Open the door. Open the door.</i>

01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:47.700
You big dummy,
how the hell y'all don't know
how to get to the B.Q. E.?

01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:51.700
Let me explain something to you.
lf you make me miss my hookup
with Miss Honey Daniels,

What's up, girl?
Hey, Missy.

01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:20.000
Man, good to see you.
You too.

01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:23.700
Honey, this is Blaque right here.
And Blaque, this is Honey Daniels.

01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:25.500
<i>She's the choreographer</i>
<i>l was telling y'all about.</i>

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:28.400

01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:30.200
