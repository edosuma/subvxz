A NETFLIX SERIES

00:20.520 --> 00:21.354
Hi.

00:22.772 --> 00:24.607
I think my daughter likes you.

00:26.526 --> 00:28.278
Manny? I saw you talking.

00:30.780 --> 00:32.866
-Manny is your daughter?
-Yes.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.952
Well, Fede's dad and I…

00:37.871 --> 00:40.749
She's a very intelligent woman.

00:41.541 --> 00:42.500
And talented.

00:43.585 --> 00:46.504
Just a little disoriented right now, but…

00:49.466 --> 00:50.300
Isabel.

00:51.676 --> 00:54.763
Could you speak with her?

00:55.930 --> 01:00.435
She's between jobs,
and it might be a good idea to…

01:00.518 --> 01:01.352
Hi.

01:03.063 --> 01:03.897
Can we go?

01:04.481 --> 01:06.483
I'm staying with my parents today.

01:07.817 --> 01:11.237
-Susana, send me her number.
-Sure.

01:12.530 --> 01:15.158
-Good night.
-Same to you.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.495
Say hello to them.

01:32.759 --> 01:35.678
VALENTINA, WE NEED TO TALK

01:41.309 --> 01:44.354
WE CAN'T MEET AGAIN
I DON'T TRUST EITHER OF US

01:51.236 --> 01:52.070
Hey.

01:54.948 --> 01:55.782
Are you okay?

01:57.909 --> 02:00.161
I can't sleep so I'm looking at photos.

02:01.204 --> 02:02.455
Isn't this one cute?

02:04.415 --> 02:05.708
All of us together.

02:15.343 --> 02:16.386
But of course.

02:17.303 --> 02:19.097
I knew I saw him somewhere.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.933
-Who?
-Camilo. Manny's boyfriend.

02:22.684 --> 02:26.312
We were tailing Chango.
He's one of their drivers.

02:30.316 --> 02:31.860
The Mayor of Yucatan.

02:33.194 --> 02:34.028
Miguel.

02:35.530 --> 02:36.447
Miguel Andrade.

02:39.033 --> 02:40.451
How do you know him?

02:42.954 --> 02:44.664
I don't know him personally.

02:46.124 --> 02:47.542
Everybody knows him there.

03:06.352 --> 03:07.228
Hey.

03:09.564 --> 03:10.398
Look at me.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.954
-What's wrong?
-That's what I want to know.

03:25.955 --> 03:29.792
Where are you?
Thinking about someone else?

03:30.877 --> 03:32.128
Fuck.

03:33.546 --> 03:35.340
You guys are so blunt.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.720
Women aren't too subtle either.

03:45.808 --> 03:47.977
-I'll take you if you're leaving.
-No.

03:51.147 --> 03:52.232
You know what?

03:53.775 --> 03:56.277
-You smother me!
-Because I care about you?

03:57.779 --> 04:01.324
You want me to be one of those guys
who just want to fuck you?

04:01.991 --> 04:03.451
You can't take it.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.579
Your macho ego can't take it.

04:06.663 --> 04:08.581
I don't want to share you!

04:09.540 --> 04:13.503
-Why can't you get that?
-Because I'm not a fucking object.

04:14.629 --> 04:17.757
And for the umpteenth time,
we're not dating.

04:23.554 --> 04:25.098
Mr. Ignacio. How are you?

04:25.765 --> 04:27.392
Would you like some coffee?

04:27.475 --> 04:30.979
No, thanks.
Why is Catalina taking so long?

04:31.813 --> 04:34.774
She tried five outfits
and still hasn't decided.

04:37.110 --> 04:40.530
Mr. Ignacio, I'm so sorry for your loss.

04:41.239 --> 04:43.866
I didn't get a chance after he died.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.786
It must've been tough finding him

04:48.037 --> 04:49.706
like that.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.874
Better me than Mrs. Catalina.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.544
The poor thing feels guilty.

04:56.421 --> 04:57.797
I can't bear to think…

04:58.923 --> 05:02.218
that maybe if Simón
hadn't been alone that night…

05:02.927 --> 05:07.056
He wasn't alone.
Víctor was with him for a while.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.475
And look what happened anyway.

05:09.559 --> 05:12.687
Víctor was with Simón that night?

05:12.770 --> 05:13.938
Yes, sir.

05:15.064 --> 05:16.607
I'll get your coffee.

05:23.406 --> 05:27.243
I'm just saying you should visit Grandpa
once in a while.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.203
So he's Grandpa now?

05:29.287 --> 05:33.583
-Calling him Grandpa is all he wants.
-I'm not too sure about that.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.501
Me neither.

05:35.585 --> 05:39.172
That old fox is up to something.

05:39.255 --> 05:44.010
Yes, he'll either pay my tuition
or finance my new business.

05:44.093 --> 05:45.428
That's how evil he is.

05:46.429 --> 05:48.931
After what happened to your mom?

05:49.015 --> 05:50.767
Don't accept it, I feel--

05:50.850 --> 05:52.810
"I feel this and that."

05:52.894 --> 05:55.563
I'm sick and tired
of your feelings, Bautista.

05:55.646 --> 05:57.648
Some people are just decent.

05:58.775 --> 06:01.652
What else does Grandpa need to do
to convince you?

06:03.196 --> 06:04.030
Please!

06:08.534 --> 06:09.369
Bye.

06:20.254 --> 06:22.840
Thanks for coming with me
to bring him flowers.

06:23.341 --> 06:24.675
I hate coming alone.

06:25.676 --> 06:28.262
I can't believe
it's been three months already.

06:29.013 --> 06:30.556
I wanted to come.

06:31.307 --> 06:34.227
And be with you for a while.

06:35.103 --> 06:38.272
Ignacio, please, stop it.

06:38.898 --> 06:41.025
I can't have a relationship with you.

06:41.109 --> 06:44.278
Why? Don't you feel anything for me?

06:44.362 --> 06:47.448
My feelings have nothing to do with it.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.700
It's a moral issue.

06:50.243 --> 06:54.831
You've never sacrificed your life
for anyone, so you don't get it.

06:54.914 --> 06:55.873
Sacrifice?

06:56.374 --> 06:58.876
I let my brother marry the woman I love

06:59.877 --> 07:01.712
knowing he wouldn't make her happy.

07:02.713 --> 07:04.632
My brother never knew what love is.

07:04.715 --> 07:08.302
He was taught to rule,
to have all the power.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.014
Since he was a kid.

07:12.098 --> 07:15.309
My husband killed himself
while I had sex with his brother.

07:17.103 --> 07:20.314
How can I ever forgive myself?

07:23.568 --> 07:25.778
Catalina. Wait.

07:30.074 --> 07:33.953
What if Simón didn't take his own life?

07:52.263 --> 07:55.224
I heard this is what you give
recovering patients.

07:56.559 --> 07:57.810
I hope you like it.

08:00.229 --> 08:02.356
I don't know you that well, Manny,

08:02.440 --> 08:05.818
but something tells me
you're not one of those people

08:05.902 --> 08:08.488
who visit their sick granddads
for nothing.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.240
What do you need?

08:13.784 --> 08:14.744
May I?

08:21.626 --> 08:24.545
Caridad says you offered her money
for a new business.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.049
Can you do the same for me?

08:30.801 --> 08:32.428
What do you have in mind?

08:32.512 --> 08:33.679
A strip club.

08:35.181 --> 08:39.018
I'm a stripper
and before you start speechifying…

08:39.101 --> 08:42.813
Speeches are for politicians, Manny.

08:44.815 --> 08:48.486
What a woman does with her body
is her business.

08:49.737 --> 08:54.075
But setting up a strip club
can't be easy to do.

08:55.243 --> 08:59.038
There's the building,
the license, the staff.

08:59.121 --> 09:00.039
Look, Grandpa.

09:01.082 --> 09:01.958
Grandpa.

09:04.585 --> 09:06.295
I've got the perfect place.

09:08.130 --> 09:09.215
And it's for sale.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.470
We talked about work, the office, and…

09:15.137 --> 09:18.683
Gregorio was my PA.
I know nothing of his private life.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.311
Interns come and go all year long.

09:22.895 --> 09:25.398
What was he working on
when he went missing?

09:26.399 --> 09:28.818
He was researching Conaculta.

09:28.901 --> 09:30.194
Could it hurt anyone?

09:32.655 --> 09:35.241
The results were never published.

09:35.324 --> 09:37.660
Why all the questions?

09:38.160 --> 09:40.288
You think something happened to Gregorio?

09:42.331 --> 09:45.793
His body was found a week ago,
but they think he was killed earlier.

09:46.919 --> 09:48.713
And his laptop is missing.

09:48.796 --> 09:51.424
I guess it had damning evidence
against Simón.

09:52.133 --> 09:55.177
They planned to go public,
but Simón killed himself.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.680
They can still publish it.

09:58.222 --> 10:00.725
No, it's too late.

10:00.808 --> 10:03.561
We can't be sure and we promised Rogelio.

10:03.644 --> 10:05.229
The killer has it.

10:05.313 --> 10:08.190
I'm worried that if an investigation
is launched,

10:08.899 --> 10:13.112
we'll have to explain
how we got the evidence.

10:14.363 --> 10:16.616
And your boyfriend
would be in trouble, nun.

10:20.161 --> 10:22.371
-That must be Lorenzo.
-I'll get it.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.088
-Hi.
-Hi.

10:32.256 --> 10:34.467
Remember when we tailed Chango,

10:34.550 --> 10:37.053
we realized he had something to do
with Andrade?

10:37.637 --> 10:38.804
-Yes.
-Look.

11:03.746 --> 11:04.914
Hi, gorgeous.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.333
How do you like my new job?

11:07.917 --> 11:09.293
Let's celebrate.

11:09.377 --> 11:13.506
Wait a minute. Look what happened.
It's all broken.

11:14.507 --> 11:17.718
I'll have it cleaned up tomorrow.
Please use the other door.

11:18.260 --> 11:19.845
Sure. Let's go.

11:20.554 --> 11:24.141
Phone me when you get home.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.477
And take an Uber home.

11:26.560 --> 11:30.231
She's not a kid. Let's go!

11:34.151 --> 11:36.112
This is why we're investigating him.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.029
Look.

11:40.616 --> 11:42.743
A human trafficking network?

11:44.412 --> 11:46.205
Unbelievable. He's a mayor.

11:47.248 --> 11:49.834
Lots of famous people
profit from the business.

11:51.919 --> 11:54.547
I'll text Carlos.
He's sure to reply immediately.

11:56.340 --> 12:00.428
Did Andrade mention anyone
or anything about the meeting?

12:02.847 --> 12:06.684
No, the thing is,
when you work for politicians,

12:06.767 --> 12:10.896
you never see or hear anything
in the back seat.

12:11.522 --> 12:14.400
And I'm not his driver,
so he didn't talk to me.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.445
-Did Carlos reply?
-Yes.

12:17.528 --> 12:18.404
What did he say?

12:18.988 --> 12:22.742
He picked him up at the airport
last night and left him at his hotel.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.536
What a coincidence.

12:26.245 --> 12:29.665
He hasn't left the hotel
since he arrived last night,

12:29.749 --> 12:31.876
but his driver's parked outside.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.004
Yes, sir.

12:36.046 --> 12:37.006
There he is now.

12:39.884 --> 12:44.013
Yes, sir. It's him.
I'll keep you updated, Detective Márquez.

12:58.527 --> 12:59.361
Carlos.

13:02.656 --> 13:03.491
New plan.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.576
I don't know, Caridad.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.996
Things are getting pretty tough here.

13:09.914 --> 13:10.998
Why tough?

13:12.291 --> 13:15.044
There have been more muggings, killings.

13:15.961 --> 13:18.339
And the cops are everywhere.

13:19.089 --> 13:20.090
Don't worry.

13:20.800 --> 13:26.722
You own a printing shop
that makes cards, fliers,

13:26.806 --> 13:29.767
and invitations to weddings
and christenings.

13:30.267 --> 13:31.310
That's right.

13:32.144 --> 13:32.978
And…

13:34.605 --> 13:37.233
how many women need papers?

13:38.275 --> 13:42.530
Sixteen for now.
Maybe 20 or more in total.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.950
Got enough money for all of them?

13:46.784 --> 13:47.952
Not yet.

13:48.953 --> 13:51.747
But I'm expecting an inheritance.

13:53.541 --> 13:56.544
So, did they see you or what?

13:57.253 --> 13:59.672
Someone's here to see you, Márquez.

14:01.590 --> 14:05.052
Thank you for seeing me
unannounced, Detective Márquez.

14:07.096 --> 14:10.933
-So you do remember me.
-Yes. You lead the Jiutepec mission.

14:12.351 --> 14:14.061
You were one of the detainees.

14:16.939 --> 14:19.817
How does a criminal become a mayor?

14:19.900 --> 14:22.653
That's a logical, but mistaken concept.

14:24.113 --> 14:27.533
I'm just a mayor
that pretended to be a criminal.

14:27.616 --> 14:29.243
What the hell do you mean?

14:29.326 --> 14:31.579
Hey, detective.

14:32.663 --> 14:34.707
There's no need to be disrespectful.

14:36.709 --> 14:40.921
You know dozens of gangs
are involved in human trafficking.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.884
You know how many tried to bribe me?

14:44.967 --> 14:46.635
How many did?

14:46.719 --> 14:48.512
Three. And the big ones.

14:49.471 --> 14:50.639
Or so they think.

14:51.599 --> 14:52.850
That's why they trust me.

14:54.184 --> 14:55.060
Look.

14:59.148 --> 15:03.527
Here are the leaders' names,
their hideouts,

15:04.111 --> 15:05.571
and all the data I gathered.

15:06.780 --> 15:09.158
I'm here because I think it's enough.

15:10.284 --> 15:11.118
Here it is.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.539
Have a nice day.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.425
It's reliable information.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.093
Unbelievable.

15:28.177 --> 15:29.887
We spoke about him recently,

15:29.970 --> 15:32.681
and he shows up at the precinct
with evidence.

15:33.390 --> 15:35.476
-Someone tipped him off.
-Who?

15:35.559 --> 15:38.020
No idea, but this is all fake, Lorenzo.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.313
Or a stroke of luck.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.943
All that matters is
we'll be arresting these guys soon.

15:44.610 --> 15:48.822
According to Andrade's reports,
they have a dozen women.

15:48.906 --> 15:51.450
This guy left prison
a year and a half ago.

15:51.533 --> 15:53.661
How can you trust him?

15:53.827 --> 15:55.204
He got out in a month,

15:55.287 --> 15:58.582
then he became mayor
because he cooperated with the cops.

15:59.583 --> 16:01.251
He's a good guy, Valentina.

16:40.833 --> 16:41.667
May I?

16:47.423 --> 16:48.257
Bautista.

16:51.093 --> 16:55.347
Why didn't you say you were after
human trafficking gangs in Yucatan?

16:57.182 --> 16:58.475
It was too risky.

16:58.559 --> 17:02.312
Miguel, it's far riskier to think
you're trafficking women.

17:03.981 --> 17:06.191
I thought it was you who reported me.

17:06.859 --> 17:10.362
-It's my fault you went to jail.
-No. It's my fault.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.700
For not telling you the truth.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.078
How did you find out?

17:18.620 --> 17:19.913
It doesn't matter.

17:21.915 --> 17:23.542
I just wanted to apologize.

17:26.253 --> 17:27.337
-Goodbye, Miguel.
-No.

17:28.630 --> 17:32.217
Before you run away like in Cancún,
please give me your number.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.595
I'll be here a few more days.

17:35.596 --> 17:36.597
I'd like to see you.

17:57.951 --> 17:58.869
This is Miguel.

17:59.578 --> 18:03.082
I met a woman from my past.
Do I need to worry?

18:03.165 --> 18:04.208
Her name is…

18:06.376 --> 18:07.920
Juana Bautista Mai.

18:13.801 --> 18:17.930
I felt you'd make a great PR agent.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.309
I don't know if you have a job, but…

18:25.687 --> 18:27.189
I'm going to kill my mom.

18:29.733 --> 18:31.110
No, please.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.822
It's all my fault.

18:36.448 --> 18:38.325
I thought I was being subtle.

18:40.661 --> 18:43.288
We women aren't as subtle as we think.

18:44.665 --> 18:47.626
Why don't you tell me
why you invited me out to eat?

18:49.670 --> 18:53.465
I want to know what's going on
between Federico and Valentina.

18:56.593 --> 18:57.553
They're siblings.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.139
Siblings don't kiss on the lips.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.766
They didn't know that when they met.

19:28.292 --> 19:31.879
-There's no signal here.
-Tell me all you know about Ana.

19:32.671 --> 19:36.008
-Can I trust you?
-Yes, you can. Answer me.

19:36.508 --> 19:38.051
Wait!

19:39.845 --> 19:44.016
I came without knowing who you are
or what you want. Isn't that enough?

19:45.392 --> 19:46.351
Please.

19:46.435 --> 19:50.230
I haven't heard from her in six months.
I need to know if she's alive.

19:50.314 --> 19:51.899
To ease your conscience.

19:53.692 --> 19:56.695
My sister vanished because of you.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.363
You're her brother?

20:00.240 --> 20:03.202
I decoded her texts and emails.

20:04.286 --> 20:08.081
You made her infiltrate
a human trafficking network.

20:11.335 --> 20:13.795
-Hey!
-No! Wait! Hey!

20:15.714 --> 20:17.466
Damn it! He saw you!

20:22.679 --> 20:24.348
I don't know what to think.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.645
Although Federico and Valentina
are siblings,

20:29.728 --> 20:34.191
impossible loves are stubborn
and Federico hasn't gotten over it.

20:35.192 --> 20:38.862
I don't even know if I can be jealous.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.365
The issue is monogamy.

20:42.199 --> 20:45.869
That's why I'd rather be free,
with no biases or chains.

20:45.953 --> 20:49.456
Then you're lucky.
Or maybe you never fell in love.

20:54.336 --> 20:55.545
Just once.

20:57.506 --> 20:58.632
I learned my lesson.

21:00.884 --> 21:02.344
You know what you need?

21:03.345 --> 21:04.429
A night of fun.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.266
And I know the best places.

21:09.309 --> 21:10.143
Call me.

21:13.981 --> 21:14.815
What?

21:16.024 --> 21:19.236
I'm trying to figure out
what you're thinking.

21:21.029 --> 21:22.030
But it's hard.

21:25.409 --> 21:27.869
I think you're an incredibly
attractive woman.

21:33.583 --> 21:35.377
And I'm glad you're not subtle.

21:51.685 --> 21:53.103
Ana was a reporter?

21:54.146 --> 21:56.440
Recently hired as an intern
by the magazine.

21:57.524 --> 22:01.278
We knew how risky it was
for even the cops to find out.

22:01.778 --> 22:02.904
I'm not a cop.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.908
I'm your friend. Why didn't you tell me?

22:09.745 --> 22:11.079
I felt so guilty.

22:13.415 --> 22:16.543
I refused to see the danger,
I focused on getting a Pulitzer,

22:16.626 --> 22:19.588
or some crap like that
I really don't care about.

22:22.883 --> 22:24.509
It's all my fault, Lorenzo.

22:26.678 --> 22:28.680
Her brother is right to hate me.

22:30.474 --> 22:32.392
I need him to contact me again.

22:35.228 --> 22:36.855
I just need to sign it?

22:39.191 --> 22:44.112
Yes, you'll be the club's manager
as soon as you do.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.992
And I can make decisions,
the profit's all mine?

22:50.160 --> 22:52.871
Of course. You're the owner, Manny.

22:54.498 --> 22:59.086
I'm just organizing a company
you represent for tax purposes.

23:01.588 --> 23:04.674
Why don't you consult your lawyer first?

23:06.343 --> 23:07.594
Do you know one?

23:10.639 --> 23:15.143
But hurry up because the owner
has another offer.

23:17.604 --> 23:18.438
Right.

23:23.610 --> 23:25.112
Or I could trust you.

23:38.458 --> 23:40.377
You're not as bad as you look.

23:41.128 --> 23:43.171
Do I look like a bad guy?

23:45.090 --> 23:46.800
Sometimes you have bad vibes.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.386
You need to work on it.

23:58.186 --> 24:01.857
Miss, I need to eat.
Can you spare some money?

24:01.940 --> 24:04.985
Please, I need a little money.
Please, Miss.

24:07.237 --> 24:08.196
Thank you.

24:15.662 --> 24:18.081
AT 8:00 NO COPS
DIAMANTE 125, ESTRELLA

24:27.883 --> 24:29.759
I thought I'd never hear from you.

24:32.220 --> 24:33.305
I'm alone.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.933
Please turn your phone off.

25:02.709 --> 25:03.835
My name is Jordi.

25:06.129 --> 25:07.839
Ana never mentioned a brother.

25:07.923 --> 25:10.342
We were separated when our parents died.

25:10.425 --> 25:13.970
I tried to contact her,
but she disappeared.

25:14.054 --> 25:18.266
I came to Mexico four months ago
when I heard the cops had her ID.

25:18.808 --> 25:20.477
I'm here to find my sister.

25:20.560 --> 25:25.482
-The authorities know nothing about her.
-They're a bunch of idiots.

25:29.819 --> 25:33.406
Ana was kidnapped by a guy named El Bagre.

25:34.115 --> 25:36.785
He handed her over to a guy
known as Cabrilla.

25:36.868 --> 25:38.286
How do you know that?

25:38.370 --> 25:42.541
You just need to know where to look
and connect the dots.

25:59.099 --> 26:02.727
It's a huge criminal network.

26:18.076 --> 26:20.078
Working late, Mister Deputy?

27:27.687 --> 27:31.858
MIGUEL: LET'S GET TOGETHER
WE HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT

27:34.611 --> 27:37.113
I can work from anywhere with a computer.

27:37.197 --> 27:39.824
I'm a cybersecurity
and data protection expert.

27:40.825 --> 27:42.202
You're a white hat.

27:43.662 --> 27:46.122
White hats are the good hackers, right?

27:47.957 --> 27:51.753
It's a simplistic explanation,
but we can call it that.

27:54.005 --> 27:55.465
I want you to meet Lorenzo.

27:55.548 --> 27:59.886
No. Lots of cops are in the network.
You can't trust them.

27:59.969 --> 28:04.641
I know, but Lorenzo's not like that
and he's looking for Ana, Jordi.

28:05.308 --> 28:08.311
With his info and yours
we can achieve a lot more.

28:15.944 --> 28:18.196
He was suspended twice
for breaking the rules.

28:20.615 --> 28:21.449
The cloud.

28:23.326 --> 28:28.415
Fine, but in a noisy public place
where there's a lot of people.

28:28.498 --> 28:31.084
Law enforcement frequencies
can't get there.

28:31.167 --> 28:32.085
Okay.

28:35.630 --> 28:36.923
So who's this guy?

28:37.006 --> 28:40.051
They just said to get everybody together

28:40.135 --> 28:41.553
to see what the deal is.

28:41.636 --> 28:44.764
We had to close for that?
We're losing money.

28:44.848 --> 28:46.307
Orders, Nina.

28:48.351 --> 28:51.271
Manny! You're a sight for sore eyes!

28:51.771 --> 28:54.691
You're just in time
if you're looking for work.

28:54.774 --> 28:56.693
The new owner is on his way.

28:56.776 --> 28:59.696
It's a she and you're looking at her.

29:02.198 --> 29:05.744
Oh, please, Manny!
You never had a pot to piss in!

29:05.827 --> 29:09.289
Things have changed,
and so will working conditions here,

29:10.290 --> 29:13.501
starting with salaries
and health insurance for all.

29:14.002 --> 29:16.045
Tips belong to the workers.

29:16.129 --> 29:18.715
We kick out guys
that lay a finger on them.

29:19.299 --> 29:21.634
No private sessions with cameras off.

29:24.637 --> 29:25.472
Great.

29:27.140 --> 29:28.725
Okay. Get back to work.

29:32.103 --> 29:34.022
So, what do you think?

29:35.565 --> 29:40.904
Three days rest is great.
But why the change?

29:42.030 --> 29:47.035
Honey, you can't run the place
nonstop from Tuesday to Saturday.

29:48.286 --> 29:49.120
Besides,

29:51.331 --> 29:55.043
I decided you're the only singer we need.

29:56.085 --> 29:59.923
And the Fénix is your concert arena.

30:00.006 --> 30:02.008
Great, right? What do you think?

30:03.176 --> 30:06.012
What's wrong, Matilde?
You don't seem to like the idea.

30:06.721 --> 30:09.224
Well, yes I do.

30:09.307 --> 30:13.812
But I would've liked you to ask me first.

30:13.895 --> 30:17.482
Honey, everybody loves you.
You're a huge star.

30:18.316 --> 30:19.818
Yes, honey,

30:19.901 --> 30:24.531
but maybe Matilde has bigger dreams

30:24.614 --> 30:26.783
than singing in a bar all her life.

30:28.159 --> 30:29.494
And be used.

30:30.537 --> 30:34.040
No. You're safe in Fénix.

30:35.416 --> 30:36.668
What else do you need?

30:38.127 --> 30:39.003
Right?

31:07.198 --> 31:09.534
You're acting weird since the opening.

31:11.286 --> 31:15.582
No. I just wanted to spend more time
with my parents.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.001
It's been a long time.

31:20.128 --> 31:22.630
I know you, Isabel. Something's going on.

31:23.631 --> 31:28.678
We don't know each other that well.
We only got together recently.

31:30.263 --> 31:33.600
-Did I do something wrong?
-Fede. Everything's okay.

31:34.642 --> 31:35.560
-Okay?
-Okay.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.281
You mean the world to me.

31:49.574 --> 31:50.575
I need you.

31:53.411 --> 31:54.245
I know.

32:05.298 --> 32:07.300
Do they really want to exhume the body?

32:08.801 --> 32:10.470
Your mom wants to know the truth.

32:10.970 --> 32:12.096
The truth about what?

32:12.680 --> 32:15.975
Dad killed himself, period,
out of shame and weakness.

32:16.059 --> 32:18.519
Besides, it's in the coroner's report.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.105
There was no autopsy.

32:21.189 --> 32:23.608
Because my mom asked Grandpa to avoid it.

32:23.691 --> 32:26.235
It wasn't her idea. It was his idea.

32:26.861 --> 32:29.822
Víctor was with Simón the night…

32:29.906 --> 32:33.743
Víctor isn't involved.
He'd give his life for my dad.

32:33.826 --> 32:36.537
But he's also obsessively loyal
to the old man.

32:37.872 --> 32:39.123
He'd do anything for him.

32:40.833 --> 32:44.003
I know what hating your dad is like.
Trust me, Uncle.

32:44.963 --> 32:47.507
But thinking Grandpa
would kill his own son?

32:48.049 --> 32:51.678
He's weird and cold, but a killer?
I don't think so.

32:56.641 --> 33:00.103
VALENTINA:
WE CAN'T MEET AGAIN. I DON'T TRUST US.

33:00.853 --> 33:01.771
Give me a sec.

33:07.860 --> 33:08.903
What's that box?

33:08.987 --> 33:12.907
My mom left it when she moved.
She didn't know what to do with it.

33:14.742 --> 33:16.369
-Is it Simón's?
-Yes.

33:26.462 --> 33:29.298
YOU'RE RIGHT, VAL. ME NEITHER.

33:57.285 --> 33:58.995
They screwed you over, Simón.

34:01.622 --> 34:02.749
What did you expect?

34:03.666 --> 34:05.668
You kept Alice drugged for 20 years.

34:22.518 --> 34:24.353
NEW RECORDING

34:25.271 --> 34:26.856
My name is Simón Marroquín.

34:28.733 --> 34:29.984
And I'm taping this

34:31.819 --> 34:34.030
in case something happens to me.

34:34.113 --> 34:38.159
It's my testimony against my dad,
Rogelio Marroquín.

34:39.202 --> 34:42.538
And it may be used against him.

34:49.045 --> 34:51.005
YOU'RE RIGHT, VAL. ME NEITHER.

35:02.391 --> 35:04.852
-Want some takeout?
-Yes. I'm hungry.

35:06.437 --> 35:07.605
How about sushi?

35:09.315 --> 35:10.942
-Italian.
-Okay.

35:12.026 --> 35:14.028
There is a very good one here. Nearby.

36:41.324 --> 36:43.117
