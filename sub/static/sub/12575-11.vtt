00:42.174 --> 00:44.642
And two and a sixteenth.

00:45.344 --> 00:47.505
Better let some air out of my left tires.

00:47.579 --> 00:50.776
BILL: Hey, getting your lawn ready
for Cinco de Mayo?

00:51.083 --> 00:54.416
Bill, my lawn is in a constant state
of readiness.

00:54.486 --> 00:57.284
The block party is just an opportunity
to trot her out...

00:57.356 --> 00:58.823
and show what she can do.

00:59.158 --> 01:02.457
<i>KAHN: Since you let your lawn go to hell,
okay if Doggie make on it?</i>

01:02.594 --> 01:04.994
If you've got something to say, say it.

01:05.063 --> 01:07.930
It's not my place to point out
low density patches here...

01:08.066 --> 01:10.967
over there, and behind other side of house.

01:11.336 --> 01:14.169
<i>Sucky lawn bring down
value of my property.</i>

01:14.506 --> 01:16.497
DALE: Now, you listen here, Kahn...

01:16.575 --> 01:19.669
if anyone's bringing down
the value of this neighborhood...

01:19.878 --> 01:21.038
it's me.

01:21.146 --> 01:24.172
My lawn's nothing
but ragweed and auto parts.

01:24.249 --> 01:26.979
I should be ashamed
to live next to Hank Hill.

01:27.052 --> 01:29.179
He's got the best lawn in Arlen.

01:29.254 --> 01:31.552
Best lawn after mine!

01:31.890 --> 01:33.653
[Kahn laughing]

01:35.627 --> 01:36.958
BILL: Don't worry, Hank.

01:37.029 --> 01:40.089
We might be able to tell
Kahn's lawn is better than yours.

01:40.165 --> 01:43.191
But all those people
at the block party, they won't.

01:43.268 --> 01:44.895
They'll be drunk.

01:48.841 --> 01:52.038
Damn, I've poured
my whole life into this lawn.

01:52.211 --> 01:54.008
My heart, my soul.

01:54.880 --> 01:58.407
The tender feelings
I've held back from my family.

01:59.084 --> 02:02.212
Now, Hank, you don't
want to win that way.

02:02.521 --> 02:06.548
Why don't you just switch those back,
and go in and hug your wife?

02:09.328 --> 02:12.695
Bethany, it does not matter
if your avocados are hard.

02:13.031 --> 02:14.498
Life is hard.

02:14.700 --> 02:17.134
You cannot make authentic guacamole...

02:17.202 --> 02:19.727
out of lima beans and Ritz crackers.

02:20.539 --> 02:22.734
<i>Oh, these people! Gringos!</i>

02:22.975 --> 02:26.536
I am just glad you're in charge
of the block party this year, Aunt Peggy.

02:27.112 --> 02:29.876
Last year, it was all Tex and no Mex.

02:30.249 --> 02:34.743
HANK: I don't know why everyone's
so gaga over Kahn's lawn all of a sudden.

02:34.920 --> 02:37.912
For God's sakes,
the man mows with the grain.

02:38.090 --> 02:39.114
He's the devil.

02:39.191 --> 02:41.557
Anyway, Hank,
would you please tell Boomhauer...

02:41.627 --> 02:43.527
<i>Swiss cheese is not Mexican.</i>

02:43.595 --> 02:45.119
<i>It is American.</i>

02:45.264 --> 02:48.165
I want him to bring some Monterey Jack.

02:48.233 --> 02:49.791
I'm the block captain.

02:49.868 --> 02:53.235
I should have the best lawn
for Cinco de Mayo.

02:53.305 --> 02:55.170
<i>But look at her. Something's wrong.</i>

02:55.240 --> 02:58.038
<i>She's like a pretty girl with short hair.</i>

02:59.645 --> 03:02.375
Hank, what do you say
to another lawn spraying...

03:02.447 --> 03:04.312
from your favorite exterminator?

03:04.383 --> 03:06.351
Well, I don't know.

03:06.418 --> 03:10.411
I guess those twice-a-week sprayings
have been doing the job, Dale.

03:10.489 --> 03:12.354
I lost another client.

03:12.991 --> 03:15.425
Thinks I use too much chemicals.

03:15.894 --> 03:19.295
<i>I say Sara Lee uses more chemicals
than I do.</i>

03:19.531 --> 03:23.399
Come on, I need to make up the income.
I'll do it for free.

03:24.202 --> 03:26.534
Well, okay.

03:26.605 --> 03:29.597
Wingo, man! I'll get my stuff.

03:30.075 --> 03:32.270
Maybe that's what's wrong
with your lawn.

03:32.344 --> 03:34.335
Dale's spraying too much poison on it?

03:34.413 --> 03:37.871
What? No. He's always sprayed my lawn.

03:38.183 --> 03:42.279
If I can give some business to my friend
and keep my lawn bug-free...

03:42.354 --> 03:44.015
it's worth $2 a week.

03:44.089 --> 03:47.456
Good for you for choosing your friend
over your lawn.

03:49.461 --> 03:50.519
DALE: All right!

03:50.596 --> 03:54.032
Turn your cuffs down, boys.
And make sure you're zipped.

03:54.099 --> 03:55.589
You know what, Dale?

03:55.667 --> 03:58.932
I thought it over,
and I think I'll take a rain check.

03:59.004 --> 04:01.837
But I was gonna spray for fire ants today.

04:01.907 --> 04:04.171
All the same, I'll give it a pass.

04:04.242 --> 04:08.110
DALE: I wouldn't advise that.
You risk getting a queen.

04:08.513 --> 04:09.912
Look at her!

04:10.616 --> 04:13.983
<i>She can lay a million eggs
in a 24-hour period.</i>

04:14.219 --> 04:18.212
BILL: Wow! That's more than
a human woman does in a lifetime.

04:18.290 --> 04:22.522
These fire ants are well-organized,
highly-trained insects.

04:22.594 --> 04:25.927
<i>They'll swarm all over you
and sting you all at once...</i>

04:25.998 --> 04:28.660
<i>without warning, on a single command.</i>

04:29.001 --> 04:31.492
It's how they killed L. Ron Hubbard.

04:32.070 --> 04:35.665
Dale, fire ants don't sting you all at once.

04:35.941 --> 04:38.933
Half of them bite,
the other half are on defense.

04:39.011 --> 04:40.478
That's not true.

04:40.545 --> 04:43.844
I don't know, man. Hank's the man.
He knows. Dang old Hank's the man.

04:43.915 --> 04:46.076
What are you guys listening to Hank for?

04:46.151 --> 04:51.589
I have dedicated my professional career
to the study and control of arthropods.

04:51.957 --> 04:56.451
I've personally taste-tested
each and every household insecticide.

04:56.561 --> 04:58.290
<i>I have read a book.</i>

04:58.463 --> 05:00.795
Now, who do you believe, me or Hank?

05:00.866 --> 05:02.834
Hank is more believable.

05:02.968 --> 05:04.936
<i>Fine. Side with him.</i>

05:05.137 --> 05:09.836
Just to show you what a big man I am,
I'll still spray your lawn.

05:10.676 --> 05:13.839
Dale, I don't want you
to spray my lawn anymore.

05:13.912 --> 05:15.812
Not now, not ever.

05:16.314 --> 05:19.181
I see what's going on here.

05:19.251 --> 05:21.446
You got another exterminator.

05:21.687 --> 05:25.384
Is he licensed? Is he bonded? Is that it?

05:25.457 --> 05:28.187
Did you want someone
who's licensed and bonded?

05:28.260 --> 05:31.718
Dale, let's not make this any harder
than it has to be.

05:31.797 --> 05:33.025
It's over.

05:33.098 --> 05:36.067
But I'm your exterminator.

05:36.268 --> 05:38.031
You were my exterminator.

05:38.270 --> 05:40.170
Now we're just friends.

05:43.375 --> 05:45.570
Don't do this to me in front of everybody.

05:45.644 --> 05:48.841
Let me just spray a little
to keep up appearances.

What do you think?
Does this say "Hank Hill"?

06:24.916 --> 06:27.817
I thought we just came
for seed and fertilizer.

06:27.886 --> 06:30.320
Why are men so attracted to hoes?

It's $1.25 a square foot.

06:41.833 --> 06:43.960
<i>So what? It's worth it.</i>

06:44.269 --> 06:47.636
Look, some people hoist a flag
to show they love our country.

06:47.706 --> 06:49.731
My lawn is my flag.

06:50.242 --> 06:51.903

trustworthy salesman of propane...

06:56.181 --> 06:58.046
"and propane accessories."

HANK: Peggy, I didn't do it for me.
I did it for Arlen.

07:25.043 --> 07:27.179
It looks so nice. Can I touch it?

07:27.312 --> 07:30.543
