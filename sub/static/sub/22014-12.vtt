WEBVTT

00:01.735 --> 00:04.705
That is why I think
I should be your choice

00:04.805 --> 00:06.874
for our club president.

00:06.974 --> 00:07.841
Thank you.

00:07.941 --> 00:09.910
So,
how does this work?

00:10.010 --> 00:12.613
Is there, like,
a ballot box, or...?

00:13.547 --> 00:15.449
Yes!
Aaron,
what the heck?!

00:15.549 --> 00:17.585
(rock music plays in distance)

00:17.685 --> 00:20.188
No. They wouldn't.

00:20.788 --> 00:23.724
(to the tune of Born to
be Wild) * Get your
wheelchair van runnin' *

00:23.824 --> 00:26.026
* Annual DiMeo road trip *

00:26.127 --> 00:29.397
I call vice president!
* It's getting harder
to surprise you *

00:29.497 --> 00:30.564
* So we're doing this
at school *

00:30.664 --> 00:32.266
Ray, I think your parents
are that way.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.767
Thanks!
Say hi to them for me.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.603
* Hopefully, you're more
excited than embarrassed *

00:35.703 --> 00:38.372
* Some people think it's cool
when dads can play guitar *

00:38.472 --> 00:41.475
(screaming)
* Dylan and JJ will have
joined us by this point *

00:41.575 --> 00:44.578
* Ray's likely runnin' away *

00:44.678 --> 00:46.414
Two, three, four!

00:46.514 --> 00:51.585
* Vans can move fa-a-a-ster
than people *

00:51.685 --> 00:55.456
**

00:55.556 --> 00:57.458
Oh, thanks again,
Kenneth.

00:57.558 --> 00:58.792
You got it all,
right?

00:58.892 --> 01:00.894
Take care of the dog,
leave a few lights on, and --

01:00.994 --> 01:02.130
Oh.

01:02.230 --> 01:04.165
The cabinet above the fridge --
whatever you do,

01:04.265 --> 01:06.900
please...
do not look in there.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.969
Don't make up
forbidden spaces

01:09.069 --> 01:10.070
to make your life seem
interesting.

01:10.171 --> 01:12.473
Aw! You know me!

01:14.242 --> 01:15.976
Wait. DiMeos.
You're leaving?

01:16.076 --> 01:17.278
But our
fundraiser's starting.

01:17.378 --> 01:18.812
You said you'd be there
when I told you

01:18.912 --> 01:21.081
we'd approved the funds
to upgrade the elevator.

01:21.182 --> 01:22.283
Oh, yeah.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.918
Yeah,
and I will be there.

01:25.018 --> 01:26.187
Oh, wonderful!

01:26.287 --> 01:27.955
Wait. Are you lying again
for sport?

01:28.055 --> 01:30.158
TBD, darling.

01:30.258 --> 01:32.460
"Let's," H-I --
"hit the road, baby!"

01:32.560 --> 01:34.495
I don't want to
go to a fundraiser

01:34.595 --> 01:36.330
and make small talk
with strangers.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.366
I'm invisible,
and no one listens to me.

01:38.466 --> 01:39.500
Let's go
to the fundraiser.

01:39.600 --> 01:40.801
What'd you say?
Not important.

01:40.901 --> 01:43.271
You know,
we committed to it,

01:43.371 --> 01:45.773
and I've committed
to doing 1 out of 10 things

01:45.873 --> 01:46.974
I commit to.

01:47.074 --> 01:48.809
Helps me win arguments
about my lack of commitment.

01:48.909 --> 01:49.810
We'll just do
a quick spin-through,

01:49.943 --> 01:51.545
say "Thank you
for the elevator,"

01:51.645 --> 01:52.946
and then we'll be
on the road in a jiff.

01:53.046 --> 01:54.348
You'll be alright for
a few minutes, kids, won't you?

01:54.448 --> 01:55.849
No problem.
Sure.

01:57.285 --> 01:58.719
(van doors close)

01:58.819 --> 02:00.554
Oh! Why are you
throwing things at me?!

02:00.654 --> 02:02.823
Oh! Did Mom pack
everything we own?!

02:02.923 --> 02:04.057
(sighs)

02:04.158 --> 02:05.893
No! Those are
our road-trip snacks!

02:05.993 --> 02:08.362
You eat those now,
we'll have nothing to eat later.

02:08.462 --> 02:11.832
Allow me to explain the concept
of delayed gratification.

02:11.932 --> 02:13.234
Allow me to explain
the concept

02:13.334 --> 02:14.668
of eating
like Cookie Monster.

02:14.768 --> 02:17.505
Nom, nom, nom, nom,
nom, nom, nom, nom...

02:17.605 --> 02:18.972
You're not even
ingesting them!

02:19.072 --> 02:20.140
...nom, nom, nom,
nom, nom...

02:20.241 --> 02:23.143
(disco music plays)

02:23.244 --> 02:25.846
Ooh!
A '70s theme.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.415
Where are
the long lines for gas?

02:27.515 --> 02:30.017
Oh! Too soon!

02:30.117 --> 02:31.985
Let's do a lap and leave,
shall we?

02:32.085 --> 02:33.321
If we get trapped
in a conversation

02:33.421 --> 02:35.556
and we need help,
the code word is "Winnebago."

02:35.656 --> 02:38.158
Don't worry. I'm not
having any conversations.
There's a nacho bar.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.160
Have I told you
about my new nacho system,

02:40.261 --> 02:42.730
where every bite has
the perfect distribution of --

02:42.830 --> 02:43.897
Winnebago.

02:43.997 --> 02:47.868
**

02:47.968 --> 02:50.070
Oh. Do you mind if I take it?
I need it.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.106
I'm not good
in social situations. Thanks.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.876
Okay, see?
That was rude.

02:55.976 --> 02:57.745
Oh, no, I assure you,
I'm no better.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.547
Luckily,
I'm lawless.

03:00.448 --> 03:02.015
Alright.

03:02.115 --> 03:04.718
Is there a famous
'70s lesbian?

03:04.818 --> 03:06.854
Because I am her
for you right now.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.256
(laughs)

03:08.356 --> 03:09.523
There he is!

03:09.623 --> 03:10.958
Alright!

03:11.058 --> 03:13.126
No one is paying
attention to me!

03:13.227 --> 03:14.762
I store loose change
in my butt!

03:14.862 --> 03:16.730
Hey!
Why do you do that?

03:16.830 --> 03:18.766
And why are you yelling
about it at this party?

03:18.866 --> 03:19.700
You're back.

03:19.800 --> 03:20.768
You're deejaying
this thing?

03:20.868 --> 03:22.770
Yeah, well,
after being iced

03:22.870 --> 03:25.072
by a certain
physical therapist of JJ's,

03:25.172 --> 03:26.440
I could use
a little female attention,

03:26.540 --> 03:28.309
and ladies love deejays.

03:28.409 --> 03:31.945
So when they asked me,
I (snaps fingers) hustled

03:32.045 --> 03:34.415
and got my deejay equipment
out of my...

03:34.515 --> 03:37.117
* Brick apartment

03:37.217 --> 03:38.085
You have fun.

03:38.185 --> 03:41.121
I'm going to
(snaps fingers)

03:41.221 --> 03:42.423
get the hell
out of here.

03:42.523 --> 03:44.258
(both laugh)

03:44.358 --> 03:47.561
I thought I was the only one
who sided with United!

03:47.661 --> 03:50.431
No, I get it.
Get off the plane, man!
Get off!

03:50.531 --> 03:53.066
(both laugh)
Shall we, honey?

03:53.166 --> 03:55.603
Ohh, sorry.
I've got to head out.
No. Don't go.

03:55.703 --> 03:58.105
Oh, no, I'll leave you
the booze.
Oh, sweet.

03:58.205 --> 03:59.473
Although the fact
that you knew to do that

03:59.573 --> 04:02.610
is actually why I am sad
that you're leaving.
(sighs)

04:02.710 --> 04:05.479
It was so nice
to meet you, Maya.
It's nice
to meet you, Sarah.

04:05.579 --> 04:08.181
See ya.
Bye.

04:08.282 --> 04:10.651
Ohh.
I really liked her.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.487
Did you see how disappointed
she was when I was leaving?

04:13.587 --> 04:15.155
Yeah, but did you see
how happy I am that we are?

04:15.255 --> 04:17.124
Aaah!
Oh, come on. Can we just stay
a bit longer?

04:17.224 --> 04:18.526
We've been at this school
for over a year,

04:18.626 --> 04:20.928
and it's the first time
I've connected with a parent.

04:21.028 --> 04:22.663
Plus, I'm very good
at '70s dancing.

04:22.763 --> 04:23.864
(sighs)
Should we tell the kids?

04:23.964 --> 04:26.434
The kids know that I'm good
at '70s dancing.

04:26.534 --> 04:29.169
**

04:29.269 --> 04:30.304
You liked
another mom?

04:30.404 --> 04:31.472
Really?
Look at you --

04:31.572 --> 04:34.342
going to fundraisers,
making connections.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.143
Someone's becoming
part of the community.

04:36.243 --> 04:39.046
Why do you have to find
larger themes in everything?

04:39.146 --> 04:40.280
Look, we're still gonna go
on the road trip,

04:40.381 --> 04:41.482
but just
in a few hours.

04:41.582 --> 04:44.685
Here -- walk to something fun
and enjoy each other.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.554
Mini golf it is.

04:46.654 --> 04:47.655
"Movie."

04:47.755 --> 04:49.222
No!
Arcade, you idiots!

04:49.323 --> 04:50.223
(knock on van)

04:50.324 --> 04:51.224
You're parked
in a loading zone.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.327
Move it,
or I'm gonna have you towed.

04:53.427 --> 04:54.528
I'm gonna go tell
Mom and Dad.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.164
Just drive up 5 feet
and find another spot.

04:57.264 --> 04:58.366
But I don't have
a license.

04:58.466 --> 05:01.068
Neither did the Wright brothers,
and they soared.

05:01.168 --> 05:02.235
JJ: (sighs)

05:02.336 --> 05:04.171
"You don't always
have to be the bummer."

05:04.271 --> 05:08.141
"Do it. Do it.
Do it! Do it!"

05:08.241 --> 05:09.810
(chanting)
Do it! Do it!

05:09.910 --> 05:11.345
Do it! Do it! Do it!

05:11.445 --> 05:15.483
Do it! Do it! Do it!
Do it! Do it! Do it!

05:15.583 --> 05:16.817
(engine starts)
No way!

05:16.917 --> 05:19.152
You did it?!
You psycho!

05:20.220 --> 05:21.389
MAYA: Ohh!

05:21.489 --> 05:22.856
Try these.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.393
(chuckling) Oh.

05:25.493 --> 05:27.060
And these.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.228
JIMMY: Whatever this is
is gonna suck.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.231
Yep.
Oh,
just try them on.

05:32.766 --> 05:35.168
Mm! Upside.

05:35.268 --> 05:37.237
**

05:37.337 --> 05:40.841
**

05:40.941 --> 05:44.344
**

05:44.445 --> 05:46.380
Oh, I'm gonna go
and find Sarah.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.681
Cool.

05:47.781 --> 05:50.050
I can't turn yet.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.084
I'm back!
(both scream)

05:51.184 --> 05:52.953
Oh, my God!
Sorry!

05:53.053 --> 05:55.355
Oh, don't apologize.
I love a dramatic reveal.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.957
(both laugh)
I love fringe.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.226
It's great!
It's good
for hustling.

05:59.326 --> 06:00.761
(laughs)

06:00.861 --> 06:03.597
**

06:04.698 --> 06:06.767
Oh! Excuse me,
big guy.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.538
Who is
this tall drink of water?

06:10.638 --> 06:12.773
Ooh-ooh!
Someone got tall.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.542
Yeah!
It's nice, right?

06:14.642 --> 06:17.778
When you're tall,
it affects the way
people look at you.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.279
They assume
you're intelligent --

06:19.379 --> 06:20.481
and entertaining.

06:20.581 --> 06:21.982
I've never thought that
about you.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.751
Doubt me if you want,
but it's true.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.620
My question
about the '70s theme is,

06:26.720 --> 06:28.321
where's the long line
for gas?

06:28.422 --> 06:32.392
(laughter)

06:32.493 --> 06:33.927
**

06:34.027 --> 06:35.463
I'm so glad
we met, Maya.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.665
So far, the only other friends
that I've made

06:37.765 --> 06:39.500
are other
fencing-team moms.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.101
Jake's on
the fencing team?

06:41.201 --> 06:43.303
I just remembered
another person's child's name.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.072
My brain
must really like you.

06:45.172 --> 06:47.240
(laughs) Jake was on
the fencing team,

06:47.340 --> 06:49.743
but they canceled it
because of budget cuts.

06:49.843 --> 06:50.978
Oh, no!
Yeah.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.145
But they have
enough money

06:52.245 --> 06:54.748
to upgrade
the handicapped elevator?

06:54.848 --> 06:56.450
That's a bad thing?

06:56.550 --> 06:57.751
Well,
it just seems extreme.

06:57.851 --> 06:58.986
Why should
everyone else suffer

06:59.086 --> 07:01.655
just because of an elevator
that only two kids use?

07:01.755 --> 07:02.856
Oh!
Ooh!

07:02.956 --> 07:04.825
You need
some napkins?
Yeah.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.694
Honey,
making friends yet?

07:06.794 --> 07:08.328
No, darling.
Just an enemy.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.997
Dy-no-mite!

07:13.867 --> 07:15.836
(disco music plays)
(laughs) Yeah!

07:15.936 --> 07:17.304
You're a good-looking crowd.

07:17.404 --> 07:18.506
Let's get to know each other.

07:18.606 --> 07:22.275
All the single ladies,
let me hear you scream!

07:27.615 --> 07:29.650
Wait, wait. For real?

07:29.750 --> 07:32.319
Uh...well, alright,
are there any single ladies,

07:32.419 --> 07:33.453
or are you just
not a screaming crowd?

07:33.554 --> 07:35.689
Um, well,
all the married ladies,

07:35.789 --> 07:37.390
let me hear you scream!

07:37.491 --> 07:40.861
(women screaming)

07:40.961 --> 07:42.295
Okay. Alright.

07:42.395 --> 07:44.397
Just give me a moment
while I, uh,

07:44.498 --> 07:47.034
try to figure out why I agreed
to do this for free.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.869
Then she complained
to me -- to me --

07:48.969 --> 07:51.004
that this school does too much
for kids with disability.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.305
I mean,
know your audience.

07:52.405 --> 07:53.473
Well, clearly
she doesn't,

07:53.574 --> 07:55.509
and you should use that
to your advantage.

07:55.609 --> 07:56.510
And I'm going to.

07:56.610 --> 07:57.678
Did you get smarter?

07:57.778 --> 07:58.712
Yes.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.814
All my good thoughts
are up here.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.750
Down here is just...

08:02.850 --> 08:06.019
TV theme songs, strong opinions
on new KFC offerings --

08:06.119 --> 08:07.087
stuff like that.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.556
She probably has
a whole gang of them.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.658
Well, I'm gonna go undercover
as a typical mom,

08:10.758 --> 08:12.893
I'm gonna find out who they are,
and I'm gonna give them hell.

08:12.993 --> 08:13.894
You okay?

08:13.994 --> 08:16.229
You're normally
much more happy

08:16.329 --> 08:17.731
when hell's
about to be given.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.332
It's just...

08:19.432 --> 08:21.401
I really liked her.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.071
Well, I -- I really like
the top of your head.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.272
(smooches)

08:25.372 --> 08:26.439
(horns honking)
DYLAN:
Where are we going, Ray?

08:26.540 --> 08:28.542
There are
no parking spaces!

08:29.910 --> 08:31.945
Oh. Those can't
be functional.

08:32.045 --> 08:33.180
(horn blares)

08:33.280 --> 08:36.049
Hey! You!
Learn how to drive, Grandpa!

08:36.617 --> 08:39.587
That's right --
I am your grandpa!

08:39.687 --> 08:41.755
Because I made love
to your grandma.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.558
And she told me
she wasn't proud of you.

08:44.658 --> 08:47.595
(engine revs)

08:48.428 --> 08:50.598
"Ray's being bad.

08:50.698 --> 08:51.599
I like it."

08:51.699 --> 08:53.601
Really? You guys like
the new Ray?

08:53.701 --> 08:57.605
Excuse us for being gushy,
but this has to be said.

08:57.705 --> 08:59.139
You are not a loser.

08:59.239 --> 09:01.274
**

09:01.374 --> 09:03.644
**

09:03.744 --> 09:06.780
Okay, so,
no single ladies screamed,

09:06.880 --> 09:09.316
which means either
there are no single ladies

09:09.416 --> 09:14.054
or they are here
but they're shy.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.455
So let's try this.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.423
Married ladies --

09:16.523 --> 09:17.490
(women scream)

09:17.591 --> 09:18.826
Let me finish!

09:18.926 --> 09:23.330
If you're married and you know
a single lady who's here,

09:23.430 --> 09:25.666
make some noise!

09:26.667 --> 09:28.435
(microphone thumps)

09:28.535 --> 09:30.070
No single moms?

09:30.170 --> 09:32.072
Divorce just isn't a thing
at this school?

09:32.172 --> 09:33.974
Okay, okay. Alright.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.108
We're not done here.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.076
Do the hustle.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.177
* Do the hustle *

09:37.277 --> 09:39.312
DR. MILLER: Hey, foxes!

09:39.412 --> 09:41.114
Okay, group photo time!

09:41.214 --> 09:44.117
Jimmy.
Tall guys in the back.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.252
Come on.
Oh.
(chuckles)

09:45.352 --> 09:47.688
I'm in the back.
(camera shutter clicks)

09:47.788 --> 09:50.658
**

09:50.758 --> 09:54.294
So you're the moms
against renovating

09:54.394 --> 09:55.963
the handicapped elevator?

09:56.063 --> 09:58.632
I mean, that's not, like,
our official title.

09:58.732 --> 10:01.501
Well, I'm with you ladies
all the way.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.470
I mean,
why should our kids suffer

10:03.570 --> 10:06.306
just to cater
to some small minority?

10:06.406 --> 10:08.776
You know, actually, I think
most of those kids are faking.

10:08.876 --> 10:11.511
They don't need wheelchairs.
They're just bloody lazy.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.146
* Do the hustle *
I wouldn't go that far.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.048
I bet she's right.
Name? Name?

10:17.951 --> 10:21.521
We have a plan, though,
and it's going down tonight.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.890
There's a plan?
What plan?

10:22.990 --> 10:24.357
DR. MILLER:
Wow, you can dance!

10:24.457 --> 10:26.126
Everybody,
look at Maya!

10:26.226 --> 10:29.062
(crowd cheers)
Wha--
Is there -- Can --

10:29.162 --> 10:30.297
(groans)

10:30.397 --> 10:33.000
Foiled again
by my excellent hustling!

10:33.967 --> 10:35.168
How are you, Kenneth?

10:35.268 --> 10:36.236
I love being tall!

10:36.336 --> 10:38.171
I want this night
to last forever.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.640
I'm confident.
I'm connecting with people.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.009
I-I'm never going back.

10:42.109 --> 10:43.844
Well, I-I love
having you up here,

10:43.944 --> 10:47.014
but you belong
back down there, Jimmy.

10:47.114 --> 10:48.148
No.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.751
It -- It can't end.
I won't let it.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.485
These things
are staying on!

10:52.585 --> 10:53.386
Jim--

10:53.486 --> 10:54.755
Jimmy!

10:54.855 --> 10:56.890
**

10:56.990 --> 11:00.694
Okay, um, uh,
let's forget the "single" thing.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.562
Um, I'd like something
to come out of tonight.

11:02.662 --> 11:06.934
Uh, anyone interested in
an '09 Wrangler with low miles,

11:07.034 --> 11:08.869
make some noise!

11:08.969 --> 11:10.037
* Do the hustle *

11:10.137 --> 11:11.338
Of course.

11:11.438 --> 11:14.374
God forbid even my car
gets some love tonight!

11:14.474 --> 11:17.077
"School's back
that way."

11:17.177 --> 11:19.246
And so is the old me.

11:19.346 --> 11:22.049
We're supposed to be going
on a road trip, aren't we?

11:22.149 --> 11:24.684
Now, let's be
on a road trip.

11:24.785 --> 11:27.054
O-Okay, but pay attention
to the road.

11:27.154 --> 11:30.390
Y-Y-You can do a lot of damage
with a 4,000-pound van.

11:30.490 --> 11:31.959
I like
the way you think.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.927
We do have
too much stuff back there.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.628
(The Undertones'
Teenage Kicks plays)

11:35.729 --> 11:40.801
**

11:40.901 --> 11:45.105
* Are teenage dreams
so hard to beat? *

11:45.205 --> 11:47.274
* Every time
she walks down the street *

11:47.374 --> 11:48.876
Did you put
your telescope here?

11:48.976 --> 11:50.443
Yeah, JJ thought
it'd be cool.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.879
**

11:51.979 --> 11:54.915
* Wish she was mine,
she looks so good *

11:55.015 --> 11:57.751
* I wanna hold her,
wanna hold her tight *

11:57.851 --> 11:59.753
Okay, big finish.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.889
* Right through the night *

12:01.989 --> 12:03.757
* Oh, yeah *

12:03.857 --> 12:06.894
Yeah. That was a bad one
to end on.

12:08.461 --> 12:09.429
Oh!

12:09.529 --> 12:13.266
So, this is
the notorious elevator, eh?

12:13.366 --> 12:14.802
Let's ride it.
Why?

12:14.902 --> 12:16.937
So we can
make fun of it.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.738
(elevator bell dings,
both laugh)

12:20.740 --> 12:21.975
(elevator whirring)

12:22.075 --> 12:23.143
Dumb elevator.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.345
Still smell like
some guy's cologne much?

12:25.445 --> 12:26.847
(chuckles)

12:26.947 --> 12:28.115
(alarm rings, whirring stops)
Right.

12:28.215 --> 12:29.616
You like dramatic reveals?
Here's one.

12:29.716 --> 12:31.451
My kid is one of
the two children --

12:31.551 --> 12:34.154
there's four, actually --
that uses this elevator.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.255
Wait. What?!

12:35.355 --> 12:38.258
So, is this some kind of
undercover sting?

12:38.358 --> 12:39.292
(sighs deeply)

12:39.392 --> 12:41.094
(whirring resumes)
Don't be ridiculous!

12:41.194 --> 12:42.495
(alarm rings, whirring stops)
Hey!
Listen!

12:42.595 --> 12:43.496
Here's
what's gonna happen.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.098
You're gonna leave
this elevator,

12:45.198 --> 12:46.433
which I'd like to be
refurbished for my son,

12:46.533 --> 12:47.667
and you're going to
put a stop

12:47.767 --> 12:49.002
to whatever plan
you've concocted.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.839
And if you don't, I'm gonna use
all the energy I've devoted

12:51.939 --> 12:54.607
to making this school
a haven for my kid

12:54.707 --> 12:56.509
into making it
a hell for you.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.678
Ohh!
Now you're free
to leave.

13:03.951 --> 13:04.885
What is happening?!

13:04.985 --> 13:07.187
I told you
they needed to fix this thing!

13:07.287 --> 13:08.721
Alright,
where to next?

13:08.822 --> 13:10.557
Isn't it time
to get back to school?

13:10.657 --> 13:13.026
You're really not acting
like the Ray I know.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.195
But the Ray you know
always fought with you guys.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.396
We're having fun
together.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.832
In fact,
forget this "Ray" business.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.400
Call me Blaze.

13:21.201 --> 13:22.169
(chuckling) Oh.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.204
Blaze just figured out
his next move.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.339
What are you doing?

13:26.439 --> 13:28.541
Our soda-throwing friend.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.077
Are you gonna
mess with his car?

13:30.177 --> 13:31.912
Ray, no, let's go back
to the school.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.013
I'm Blaze.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.415
Ray, I never
appreciated it before,

13:35.515 --> 13:37.650
but you do
serve a purpose.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.019
We need a wet blanket.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.889
Without you, we're
a runaway truck without brakes.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.690
The trio
demands a weenie.

13:43.790 --> 13:45.025
I did my time.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.426
Fine! I'll do it!

13:46.526 --> 13:48.195
JJ obviously never will.

13:48.295 --> 13:49.696
He just wants to see
the world burn.

13:49.796 --> 13:54.567
There's a new killjoy in town,
and I say the fun stops now.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.404
I spent a lot of time
saying things just like that.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.372
Better on this side,
weenie.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.174
(sighs)

14:05.345 --> 14:07.881
My husband will be here
to rescue me momentarily.

14:07.981 --> 14:10.050
Oh, so, my fate rests
in the hands of a man

14:10.150 --> 14:11.885
who would marry you?
Great.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.286
Well, I wonder
who'd marry you, too.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.688
Where did you meet? At
an "I Hate Wheelchairs" rally?

14:15.788 --> 14:17.357
We met
through mutual friends!

14:17.457 --> 14:18.858
That is very boring!

14:20.360 --> 14:21.461
I don't hate your son.

14:21.561 --> 14:22.762
You got a funny way
of showing it.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.065
I don't want to take
anything away from anyone.

14:25.165 --> 14:28.368
I'm just trying to figure out
how to help my kid.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.270
Jake's not doing great,
okay?

14:30.370 --> 14:31.771
He's really lonely.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.441
Fencing is the only thing
that made him happy.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.709
I'm just --
I'm trying to figure out

14:36.809 --> 14:38.111
how to make
my son happy.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.948
But it's hurting my kid
in the process.

14:41.048 --> 14:43.483
And, I mean, I'll do anything
to protect him,

14:43.583 --> 14:47.087
even if it means taking
something away from your kid.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.257
Which is exactly
what you're doing.

14:50.357 --> 14:52.259
(gasps)

14:52.359 --> 14:54.061
Oh, I just realized
something.

14:54.161 --> 14:57.297
Other people love
their children...like how I do.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.099
I do. Please let me
see him again.

14:59.199 --> 15:01.068
I get it.
I feel you.

15:01.168 --> 15:02.569
I may even
like you again.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.737
I definitely like
your jumpsuit.

15:04.837 --> 15:05.805
Well,
I really liked you

15:05.905 --> 15:07.807
before this whole
kidnapping thing.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.609
And even then,
it was a great ambush.

15:09.709 --> 15:10.978
Did you like the irony of me
trapping you in the elevator?

15:11.078 --> 15:13.680
Oh, I got it right away.
(chuckles)

15:13.780 --> 15:15.015
Just out of curiosity,

15:15.115 --> 15:17.650
what was your plan
for saving the fencing team?

15:17.750 --> 15:19.819
Oh, I was
going to give Dr. Miller

15:19.919 --> 15:21.821
a very strongly worded
letter.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.923
A letter?! Pbht!

15:24.024 --> 15:26.593
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't think
you've read my letters.

15:26.693 --> 15:29.029
How much free soup
has Campbell's sent you?

15:29.129 --> 15:31.098
(grunts)
Hey, honey.

15:31.198 --> 15:32.832
I'm here
to get you out of there.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.334
Got a ladder,
but I'm just not sure

15:34.434 --> 15:35.969
how safe it would be
for me to --

15:36.069 --> 15:38.471
Oh, Jimmy,
take your bloody shoes off.
Copy.

15:38.571 --> 15:41.708
This isn't you.
Don't do this.

15:41.808 --> 15:43.676
Dylan,
don't fight it.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.178
We don't need
a stick in the mud.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.014
You could have
a cool nickname like me.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.348
Maybe Siren.

15:49.983 --> 15:52.785
"I'm Girth Squeezel."

15:52.885 --> 15:56.389
Girth Squeezel?
Okay, enough talk.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.191
I've got a car to egg.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.194
(grunting)

16:01.294 --> 16:02.729
Ehh! Ehh!

16:02.829 --> 16:04.664
Gah!

16:04.764 --> 16:05.865
"Wow."

16:05.965 --> 16:08.868
B-L -- "Blaze throws
a lot like Ray."

16:08.968 --> 16:10.470
(grunts)

16:11.504 --> 16:14.374
Alright, last one.
(smooches)

16:14.474 --> 16:15.642
(grunts)

16:16.876 --> 16:18.211
(gasps)

16:20.247 --> 16:22.149
Why did you guys
let me do that?!

16:22.249 --> 16:23.350
I'm Ray!

16:23.450 --> 16:25.352
Alright, now,
in times like this, it's common

16:25.452 --> 16:28.221
to feel an overpowering
attraction to your rescuer.

16:28.321 --> 16:31.358
We'll sort out those emotions
once I get my shoes back on.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.593
What's up, hero?

16:33.693 --> 16:36.096
Hey...guys!

16:36.196 --> 16:37.264
Aren't you gonna
come down, big guy?

16:37.364 --> 16:38.731
You know, I...

16:38.831 --> 16:42.735
Actually, I've got some
post-rescue inspection stuff

16:42.835 --> 16:44.237
to -- you know,
just want to...

16:45.105 --> 16:46.206
(sighs)

16:46.306 --> 16:51.911
**

16:52.011 --> 16:53.012
I don't understand.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.547
Well, the rest of him
is there on the bench.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.749
But it doesn't matter
because he's a her--

16:56.849 --> 16:59.219
Ohh.

16:59.319 --> 17:00.720
Forget tall, darling.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.889
What's important
is that you're the bigger man.

17:02.989 --> 17:04.524
I saw things
up there!

17:04.624 --> 17:06.626
A lot of you
are going bald!

17:07.227 --> 17:09.896
This is
the most expensive thing I own.

17:09.996 --> 17:13.032
One telescope
for one broken sign?

17:14.033 --> 17:16.069
You're lucky
I don't call the police.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.105
If I see you
around here again, I will.

17:18.205 --> 17:20.273
And they will find you,
Blaze.

17:20.373 --> 17:23.410
They will find you.

17:23.510 --> 17:24.777
You were right.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.114
That was irresponsible of me,
and I'm back.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.416
But it was nice
to be on the same side.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.251
You were responsible,
Dylan.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.953
Maybe we can all be
responsible ones now.

17:34.053 --> 17:37.257
**

17:39.159 --> 17:41.228
Come on, weenie!
Drive!

17:42.662 --> 17:46.933
This $50 Amazon gift card
is sold for $34.95.

17:47.033 --> 17:51.003
Okay, DJ Kenneth thinks this
fundraiser's only going so-so.

17:51.104 --> 17:52.305
That concludes --
Uh, Kenneth!

17:52.405 --> 17:53.673
I got something else
to auction.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.275
Well, is it lessons
on how to treat a deejay?

17:55.375 --> 17:56.343
'Cause they could
use that!

17:56.443 --> 17:57.410
(crowd groans)

17:57.510 --> 17:59.746
Um...
(clears throat)

17:59.846 --> 18:01.948
I always thought people with
families different from mine

18:02.048 --> 18:04.083
couldn't understand me,

18:04.184 --> 18:06.653
but after trapping this woman
in an elevator --

18:06.753 --> 18:07.987
(crowd gasps)
No, no, she's fine.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.489
I mean, Sarah,
tell them you're fine.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.458
Well, my back hurts
a little bit.
She's fine.

18:11.558 --> 18:14.026
Anyway, I realized
that you all have JJs

18:14.127 --> 18:15.262
with wants and needs

18:15.362 --> 18:18.665
that are just as important
as my child's.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.168
I don't succeed
at getting my kid what he wants

18:21.268 --> 18:24.804
just because his stuff matters
more than yours.

18:24.904 --> 18:27.340
I get it 'cause I've got
a lot of fight in me

18:27.440 --> 18:28.841
and I've had to do
much practice.

18:28.941 --> 18:29.976
So, anyway,
that's what I'm offering --

18:30.076 --> 18:32.945
me fighting
for anything you desire.

18:33.045 --> 18:34.347
100 bucks a pop.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.516
Proceeds go to
the Lafayette fencing team.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.185
(crowd reacts excitedly)
Any takers?

18:38.285 --> 18:39.852
MAN: Over here!
WOMAN: Yes! Here!

18:39.952 --> 18:41.688
(gasps)
Look at you all!

18:41.788 --> 18:43.456
Kenneth,
this is some crowd!

18:43.556 --> 18:45.992
(disco music plays)

18:46.092 --> 18:49.128
**

18:49.229 --> 18:52.131
Don't -- D-Don't say anything.
Just -- Just listen.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.566
I didn't come here tonight

18:53.666 --> 18:56.903
intending to deceive you
with magical shoes,

18:57.003 --> 18:59.872
but I put them on, and I liked
the confidence they gave me,

18:59.972 --> 19:04.010
and I liked the way
you looked at me in them.

19:04.110 --> 19:06.513
But it wasn't real.
This is.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.881
I am a not-tall man.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.851
You know, it takes a lot of
nerve to do something like that.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.821
Even more to admit it.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.756
You're not mad?
Yeah.

19:16.856 --> 19:20.227
Mad at how inspired I am
to admit my own insecurity.

19:21.093 --> 19:22.895
My name's Carl.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.398
And I always think
waiters are hitting on my wife.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.901
Uh...
I dye my hair.

19:29.001 --> 19:32.405
I'm a natural brunet,
but I-I hate it.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.841
I'm not in shape.
No!

19:34.941 --> 19:36.108
I'm just wearing
a man girdle.

19:36.209 --> 19:38.378
Look.
(Velcro rips)

19:38.478 --> 19:39.912
Whoa!

19:40.012 --> 19:41.214
Awesome!

19:41.314 --> 19:42.749
You changed lives
today, Jimmy.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.617
Platform shoes or not...

19:46.686 --> 19:48.688
...you'll always
be tall to me.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.857
And me.

19:50.957 --> 19:52.692
And me.

19:53.760 --> 19:57.764
This is the best,
weirdest...

19:57.864 --> 20:00.367
first fundraiser
I have ever been to.

20:00.467 --> 20:02.569
So, textbooks
for the Spanish club,

20:02.669 --> 20:04.704
fencing's
gonna be reinstated,

20:04.804 --> 20:06.906
and one of the parents
wants fewer water fountains

20:07.006 --> 20:08.040
for some reason.

20:08.140 --> 20:09.709
This list
is strange.

20:09.809 --> 20:10.877
JIMMY: Hey!

20:10.977 --> 20:13.112
I'm getting parents
everything they want!

20:13.212 --> 20:14.213
Look at you,
giving back.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.915
Yeah, and I want to.

20:16.015 --> 20:18.285
Dr. Miller,
I don't say this very often,

20:18.385 --> 20:20.553
but thank you.

20:20.653 --> 20:23.122
We love being part
of this community.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.991
We're home.

20:25.091 --> 20:26.259
What's wrong?

20:26.359 --> 20:27.394
Oh, now's not the time.

20:27.494 --> 20:29.429
But I've spoken
with JJ's teachers.

20:29.529 --> 20:31.163
He's...

20:31.264 --> 20:33.666
not gonna graduate
this year.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.103
(vocalizing)

20:37.203 --> 20:38.671
What up?
(chuckles)

20:39.972 --> 20:41.608
Too much
of a good thing?

20:46.245 --> 20:48.615
**

20:48.715 --> 20:49.982
Alright.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.984
So, Mom and Dad are gonna notice
that my telescope is gone,

20:52.084 --> 20:53.986
but it'll be fine
because we're all pals now.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.922
We can
back each other up.

20:56.022 --> 20:58.425
So, the story is, we saw
a poor, young schoolgirl.

20:58.525 --> 21:01.528
She told us her dream
was to be an astronomer, but --

21:01.628 --> 21:03.029
Sounds great, Ray.

21:03.129 --> 21:04.831
You guys aren't gonna
have my back, are you?

21:04.931 --> 21:06.466
No.

21:06.566 --> 21:08.301
Alright, I guess it's back
to where we started --

21:08.401 --> 21:09.669
Dylan and JJ
against the weenie.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.204
At least I still have the
20 bucks Mom and Dad gave us.

21:12.305 --> 21:16.376
"Give it to me,
or I'll tell them you..."

21:16.476 --> 21:18.210
D-R -- "drove."

21:18.311 --> 21:20.313
(sighs)

21:21.614 --> 21:23.015
Fun team while it lasted.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.884
Guess we'll always have
the memories.

21:24.984 --> 21:27.387
Nah.
Give me those, too.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.896
