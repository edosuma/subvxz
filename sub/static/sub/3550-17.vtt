WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.103
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.103 --> 00:04.205
MAY I SIT?
 NOT JUST YET.
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT?

00:04.205 --> 00:07.138
I WANNA LEARN YOUR BUSINESS
FROM THE GROUND UP,

00:07.138 --> 00:09.040
AND THEN I WANNA HELP YOU
EXPAND IT.

00:09.040 --> 00:11.182
BREE...
 MR. ALLEN?

00:11.182 --> 00:13.114
HIRED A NEW EMPLOYEE.
 NOW YOU CAN SIT.

00:13.114 --> 00:15.186
YOU SHOULD BE SAYING,
"GREAT, ANA. GO FOR IT!"

00:15.186 --> 00:17.788
GABY THOUGHT
SHE HAD ENDED A ROMANCE.

00:17.788 --> 00:19.590
WHERE'S DANNY?
 NEW YORK.

00:19.590 --> 00:21.522
DANNY WENT TO FIND ANA.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.254
YOU HAVE TO LEAVE.

00:23.254 --> 00:25.296
ROBIN WAS ASKED TO GO,

00:25.296 --> 00:27.258
BUT KATHERINE...

00:27.258 --> 00:30.731
HAD A CHANGE OF HEART.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.239
(Mary Alice)
PRESTON SCAVO WAS

00:38.239 --> 00:40.311
FINALLY COMING HOME
FROM EUROPE,

00:40.311 --> 00:42.313
AND HIS FAMILY WAS WONDERING

00:42.313 --> 00:45.476
WHAT KIND OF SOUVENIRS
HE'D BE BRINGING THEM.

00:45.476 --> 00:50.481
HIS BROTHER WANTED
AN ARMY KNIFE FROM SWITZERLAND.

00:50.481 --> 00:54.785
HIS SISTER WANTED SOME
WOODEN SHOES FROM HOLLAND.

00:54.785 --> 00:59.460
HIS FATHER WANTED
SOME CHEESE FROM BAVARIA.

00:59.460 --> 01:00.831
AND HIS MOTHER?

01:00.831 --> 01:03.063
WELL, ALL SHE WANTED

01:03.063 --> 01:07.168
WAS TO HOLD HER LITTLE BOY
IN HER ARMS...

01:07.168 --> 01:09.570
(singsongy) GUESS WHO'S BACK!

01:09.570 --> 01:12.803
BUT SHE'D SOON DISCOVER
HER LITTLE BOY

01:12.803 --> 01:15.075
WASN'T SO LITTLE ANYMORE.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.547
HEY!
 (Tom) HEY!

01:16.547 --> 01:20.581
HEY! LET ME AT HIM!
I GET THE FIRST HUG! HI.
 OH, MOM, YOU'RE HUGE!

01:20.581 --> 01:22.783
I KNOW.
WELL, LOOK AT YOU. OOH.

01:22.783 --> 01:25.256
PORTER, NOW YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GROW A MUSTACHE

01:25.256 --> 01:27.758
TO SEE HOW BAD IT WOULD LOOK.
 WHAT'D YOU BRING ME?

01:27.758 --> 01:29.760
OHH!
 PENNY, HE JUST WALKED IN.

01:29.760 --> 01:32.423
OHH!
 GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO UNPACK
AND GIVE ME MY CHEESE.

01:32.423 --> 01:35.426
ACTUALLY, I DO HAVE
A LITTLE SURPRISE.
 OH, THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME
FOR THAT.

01:35.426 --> 01:37.428
YOU'VE BEEN TRAVELING ALL DAY.

01:37.428 --> 01:41.101
YOU PROBABLY WANT TO TAKE
A SHOWER OR A NAP.
 NO, I KINDA NEED
TO DO THIS NOW.

01:41.101 --> 01:44.405
YEAH, MOM. YOU ARE REALLY GONNA
WANT TO SEE THE SURPRISE.
 (chuckles) OKAY,
I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS.

01:44.405 --> 01:46.437
UH, MAYBE I SHOULD EXPLAIN.

01:46.437 --> 01:49.210
NO, YOU DON'T NEED TO EXPLAIN.
I'M SURE WE'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.212
UH, EVERYONE...

01:51.212 --> 01:53.584
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET IRINA.

01:53.584 --> 01:54.885
(Russian accent) HELLO.

01:54.885 --> 01:58.819
I AM FINALLY TO MEET
THE LOVELY PRESTON FAMILY.

02:00.821 --> 02:04.725
(gasps)
NICE TO MEET YOU, IRINA.

02:04.725 --> 02:07.458
UM, PRESTON DIDN'T SAY
HE WAS BRINGING A FRIEND.

02:07.458 --> 02:10.231
OH, SHE'S MORE THAN A FRIEND,
MOM. WE'RE IN LOVE.

02:10.231 --> 02:12.463
(giggles)

02:12.463 --> 02:15.135
YES, PRESTON SCAVO
HAD RETURNED FROM HIS TRIP

02:15.135 --> 02:17.638
WITH A BEAUTIFUL SOUVENIR,

02:17.638 --> 02:33.384
AND HIS MOTHER WOULD SOON WISH
HE HADN'T.

02:33.384 --> 02:36.827
SOMETIMES YOU MUST WASH AWAY
THE MUD

02:36.827 --> 02:40.931
TO REVEAL THAT SPARKLING YELLOW
UNDERNEATH.

02:40.931 --> 02:45.496
SOMETIMES YOU MUST CARRY
THE FLOWER INTO THE SUNLIGHT

02:45.496 --> 02:49.240
TO APPRECIATE
THE REDNESS OF THE ROSE.

02:49.240 --> 02:52.703
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO
TAKE OFF THE WRAPPING

02:52.703 --> 02:57.648
TO UNDERSTAND JUST HOW GREEN
A BIKE CAN BE.

02:57.648 --> 03:01.312
AND IF YOU WANT TO SEE
A WOMAN'S TRUE COLORS,

03:01.312 --> 03:05.316
JUST MAKE HER FEEL UNNECESSARY.

03:05.316 --> 03:08.859
ANA, YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN!
 BUT YOU CAN'T SEE MY FACE.

03:08.859 --> 03:10.861
THIS IS A TOOL CALENDAR.

03:10.861 --> 03:12.863
IT'S GONNA BE HANGING IN
SOME FAT MECHANIC'S BASEMENT,

03:12.863 --> 03:17.368
AND HE WON'T BE LOOKING
AT YOUR FACE.
 I CAME TO NEW YORK
TO BE A FASHION MODEL.

03:17.368 --> 03:20.431
I CAME TO MAKE ART FILMS.
ISN'T LIFE FUNNY?

03:20.431 --> 03:21.902
I'M GETTING A DOUGHNUT.

03:21.902 --> 03:25.536
YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES
FOR AN ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT.

03:27.278 --> 03:29.240
HEY, ANA.

03:29.240 --> 03:31.942
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

03:31.942 --> 03:35.916
I'VE BEEN LOOKING EVERYWHERE
FOR YOU.
 YOU WASTED YOUR TIME.
WE BROKE UP.

03:35.916 --> 03:38.649
WE WERE BROKEN UP
BY YOUR AUNT.

03:38.649 --> 03:41.552
SHE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT
YOUR CAREER.

03:41.552 --> 03:44.595
ALL SHE'S EVER CARED ABOUT
IS KEEPING US APART...

03:44.595 --> 03:46.997
AND THAT'S WHY
SHE SENT YOU HERE.

03:46.997 --> 03:48.729
OH, MY GOD!

03:48.729 --> 03:51.662
THAT'S WHY THE AGENCY'S
ONLY BEEN SENDING ME OUT

03:51.662 --> 03:54.905
ON THESE CRAPPY JOBS.
(sighs) IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW.

03:57.268 --> 03:58.909
WE GOT A LOT OF CATCHING UP
TO DO.

03:58.909 --> 04:02.473
CAN WE GO SOMEWHERE
AND TALK?

04:02.473 --> 04:05.316
COME ON, JANUARY.
TIME IS MONEY.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.620
I QUIT.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.524
(door opens)
 (Angie) GABY, YOU IN HERE?

04:13.524 --> 04:14.525
(door closes)
 YEAH.

04:14.525 --> 04:16.527
I NEED ANA'S ADDRESS
IN NEW YORK.

04:16.527 --> 04:20.690
I'M ON MY WAY
TO THE AIRPORT.

04:20.690 --> 04:23.994
WHY WOULD YOU NEED THAT?
 BECAUSE DANNY RAN OFF
TO FIND HER.

04:23.994 --> 04:26.967
WELL,
I WILL SAVE YOU THE TRIP,

04:26.967 --> 04:29.300
'CAUSE IF DANNY FINDS ANA,
SHE'LL SEND HIM PACKING.

04:29.300 --> 04:31.302
SHE WANTS NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOUR SON.
 (beeping)

04:31.302 --> 04:33.344
SHE'LL TELL YOU HERSELF.

04:33.344 --> 04:35.676
(Ana) Hey, this is Ana.
Leave a message.

04:35.676 --> 04:38.679
And if you're my Aunt Gaby,
I know what you did.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.651
Drop dead.

04:42.683 --> 04:46.016
HOLD THAT CAB.
I'M COMING WITH YOU.

04:46.016 --> 04:49.059
(clank)

04:49.059 --> 04:50.661
HEY.

04:50.661 --> 04:53.394
WOW. AREN'T YOU A LITTLE
OVERDRESSED FOR BACON AND EGGS?

04:53.394 --> 04:54.995
AND BUTTERED TOAST.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.597
OH, BUTTERED TOAST.

04:56.597 --> 04:59.600
WELL, IF I'D KNOWN THAT, I WOULD
HAVE WORN MY FORMAL BOXERS.
 (laughs)

04:59.600 --> 05:01.802
SO... DO YOU LIKE IT?

05:01.802 --> 05:04.805
I GOT THE CHECK FROM THE SALE
OF THE STRIP CLUB,

05:04.805 --> 05:06.807
AND I DECIDED
TO TREAT MYSELF.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.809
PLUS, I FIGURED
I NEEDED SOMETHING TO WEAR

05:08.809 --> 05:11.442
WHEN WE GO TO CHEZ NAOMI.
 CHEZ NAOMI?

05:11.442 --> 05:13.884
WHY DON'T WE JUST STAY HOME
AND EAT MONEY?

05:13.884 --> 05:16.747
BECAUSE YOU PROMISED
TO TAKE ME THERE

05:16.747 --> 05:20.951
TO CELEBRATE PAYING
YOUR BUSINESS LOAN OFF.
 WELL, I'M SORRY,

05:20.951 --> 05:23.954
BUT THAT LOAN IS YEARS AWAY
FROM BEING PAID OFF.
 NOT ANYMORE.

05:23.954 --> 05:27.057
I TOOK CARE OF IT.
 YOU DID WHAT?

05:27.057 --> 05:30.661
WITH THE CHECK I GOT.
 WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU DO THAT FOR?

05:30.661 --> 05:33.664
(chuckles) OKAY, WHAT I THINK
YOU MEANT TO SAY WAS,

05:33.664 --> 05:35.906
"THANKS, SUSAN.
YOU'RE THE BEST WIFE EVER."

05:35.906 --> 05:38.969
THAT LOAN WAS
MY RESPONSIBILITY.

05:38.969 --> 05:41.011
(sighs) YOU WERE PAYING
9% INTEREST.

05:41.011 --> 05:43.574
YOU WERE NEVER GONNA PAY
THAT LOAN OFF.

05:43.574 --> 05:45.946
LOOK, I APPRECIATE IT.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.919
BUT IN THE FUTURE,
JUST CHECK WITH ME FIRST, OKAY?

05:48.919 --> 05:51.422
OKAY. I'M GONNA TAKE OUT
THE TRASH.

05:51.422 --> 05:52.953
NOW?

05:52.953 --> 05:54.955
LEE'S GETTING HIS MAIL.

05:54.955 --> 05:58.659
HE CAN'T SEE MY NEW DRESS
IN HERE.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.631
(door closes)

06:00.631 --> 06:03.634
THINK ABOUT IT. YOU ALREADY
SPECIALIZE IN COMFORT FOOD--

06:03.634 --> 06:06.096
MARRY THAT WITH A CREOLE
OR CAJUN TWIST.

06:06.096 --> 06:07.838
IT'S A NO-BRAINER.

06:07.838 --> 06:10.070
IT'S BRILLIANT.
I LOVE IT.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.503
YOU LOVE WHAT?

06:12.503 --> 06:15.576
SAM JUST CAME UP WITH THE IDEA
FOR MY NEXT COOKBOOK--

06:15.576 --> 06:18.008
"DOWN HOME COOKING
WITH MRS. VAN DE KAMP."

06:18.008 --> 06:20.681
THANK YOU, SAM.

06:24.685 --> 06:25.986
"TO MY DARLING SAM--

06:25.986 --> 06:28.989
I COULDN'T MAKE IT
THROUGH THE DAY WITHOUT YOU."

06:28.989 --> 06:32.923
WHAT WAS THAT?
 AH, IT'S THE, UH, DEDICATION
PAGE TO YOUR NEW COOKBOOK,

06:32.923 --> 06:34.425
I'M GUESSING.

06:34.425 --> 06:36.126
OH, AND I HAVE
YOUR FIRST RECIPE--

06:36.126 --> 06:38.429
APPLE BROWNNOSE BETTY.

06:38.429 --> 06:40.130
THAT'S, UH, SAM'S SPECIALTY.

06:40.130 --> 06:42.433
SINCE WHEN IS HARD WORK
BROWNNOSING?

06:42.433 --> 06:45.436
THAT YOUNG MAN IS THE FIRST ONE
HERE EVERY MORNING

06:45.436 --> 06:48.008
AND THE LAST ONE TO LEAVE
AT NIGHT.
 YEAH, WELL,
IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME

06:48.008 --> 06:50.481
TO TURN ALL THAT WATER
INTO WINE.

06:50.481 --> 06:52.813
WELL, I AM SORRY
YOU DON'T APPRECIATE HIM.

06:52.813 --> 06:55.015
I THINK HE'S TREMENDOUS.

06:55.015 --> 06:58.549
IN FACT, I HAVE DECIDED
TO GIVE HIM A PROMOTION.

06:58.549 --> 07:00.120
A PROMOTION TO WHAT?

07:00.120 --> 07:02.192
VICE PRESIDENT.

07:02.192 --> 07:05.756
HEY, CHECK MY STATIONERY.
I'M VICE PRESIDENT.

07:05.756 --> 07:07.027
WELL, A COMPANY
CAN HAVE MORE THAN ONE.

07:07.027 --> 07:09.460
THERE'S PLENTY OF WORK
TO GO AROUND.

07:09.460 --> 07:11.802
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

07:11.802 --> 07:15.005
YOU BARELY KNOW THE GUY.
I'M YOUR SON.

07:15.005 --> 07:17.007
I KNOW YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND THIS NOW,

07:17.007 --> 07:19.910
BUT I AM DOING WHAT I THINK
IS BEST FOR BOTH OF US.

07:19.910 --> 07:21.211
REMEMBER THAT SENTENCE.

07:21.211 --> 07:24.675
YOU'LL BE HEARING IT THE DAY
I PUT YOU IN A NURSING HOME.

07:41.692 --> 07:42.963
(doorbell rings)

07:42.963 --> 07:45.065
(gasps)

07:45.065 --> 07:48.599
OH. DID I WAKE YOU?

07:48.599 --> 07:51.041
UH, NO. I JUST DIDN'T GET
MUCH SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

07:51.041 --> 07:54.174
WHAT'S GOING ON?
 WELL, I WAS JUST ON MY WAY
TO BUY SOME OVERPRICED SHOES

07:54.174 --> 07:57.147
TO GO WITH MY OVERPRICED DRESS.
YOU WANNA COME?

07:57.147 --> 08:00.110
OH, THANKS, BUT IT'S...

08:00.110 --> 08:01.752
NOT A GOOD TIME.

08:01.752 --> 08:03.053
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

08:03.053 --> 08:05.015
YEAH. FINE. GOTTA GO.

08:05.015 --> 08:06.917
OH.

08:06.917 --> 08:10.120
PLEASE DON'T SHUT ME OUT,
KATHERINE.

08:10.120 --> 08:12.122
NOW THAT YOU'RE HOME
FROM THE HOSPITAL,

08:12.122 --> 08:15.165
I WANT US TO GO BACK
TO THE WAY WE USED TO BE.

08:15.165 --> 08:18.929
THERE WAS A TIME YOU AND I
COULD TELL EACH OTHER ANYTHING.

08:18.929 --> 08:20.230
OH, HEY, SUSAN.

08:20.230 --> 08:23.534
MORNING, HON.
I'LL GO MAKE THE COFFEE.
 UH...

08:31.211 --> 08:33.143
SO...

08:33.143 --> 08:36.515
ANYTHING YOU WANNA TELL ME?

08:45.255 --> 08:48.999
(siren wailing in distance)

08:48.999 --> 08:52.002
(horns honking)

08:55.566 --> 08:58.569
(dog barking in distance)

09:02.913 --> 09:05.776
YEAH?

09:05.776 --> 09:09.079
ARE YOU ROSE DE LUCA?
 WHY?

09:09.079 --> 09:12.322
I THINK YOU'RE MY GRANDMA.

09:12.322 --> 09:16.156
TYLER?

09:16.156 --> 09:18.929
(sighs)
 (chain scrapes)

09:18.929 --> 09:22.963
(laughing)

09:22.963 --> 09:25.596
SO AFTER WE GET TO MANHATTAN,
WHAT'S OUR PLAN?

09:25.596 --> 09:27.598
WE GO TO
ANA'S MODELING AGENCY.

09:27.598 --> 09:29.569
I KNOW THAT WORLD.
IT'S ALL INTERCONNECTED.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.042
SOMEONE WILL KNOW SOMEONE
WHO KNOWS WHERE THEY ARE.

09:32.042 --> 09:35.906
OH. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT WORLD?
WERE YOU A MODEL?
 YEAH. YOU DIDN'T KNOW?

09:35.906 --> 09:38.679
BIG-TIME. I WAS EVEN
ON THE COVER OF "VOGUE."

09:38.679 --> 09:40.981
REALLY?
 MM-HMM.

09:40.981 --> 09:45.155
WHAT HAPPENED?
 I DECIDED I WANTED A DIFFERENT
KIND OF LIFE AND MARRIED CARLOS.

09:45.155 --> 09:47.788
WOW. GOOD FOR YOU.

09:51.662 --> 09:54.094
SO...

09:54.094 --> 09:56.266
WHAT?

09:56.266 --> 09:58.899
IT'S JUST, I SHARED
SOMETHING ABOUT MY PAST,

09:58.899 --> 10:01.201
AND I KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT YOURS,

10:01.201 --> 10:03.133
LIKE WHERE YOU GREW UP

10:03.133 --> 10:06.777
OR WHERE YOU LIVED
 BEFORE MOVING TO FAIRVIEW.

10:06.777 --> 10:09.209
OH, MY PAST
ISN'T THAT INTERESTING.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.281
OH, COME ON.
I SHARED STUFF ABOUT ME.

10:11.281 --> 10:14.815
TELLING ME YOU WERE A SUPERMODEL
IS NOT SHARING. IT'S BRAGGING.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.787
IT'S NOT BRAGGING
WHEN IT'S THE TRUTH.

10:16.787 --> 10:19.790
AND THE FACT IS,
I WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL.
 WELL, IF YOU WERE
SO SUCCESSFUL,

10:19.790 --> 10:23.724
HOW COME I'VE NEVER HEARD
OF YOU BEFORE?
 BECAUSE YOU HAD TO BE LOOKING
IN A FASHION MAGAZINE,

10:23.724 --> 10:26.396
AND I DOUBT YOU WERE
EVER DOING THAT.

10:26.396 --> 10:29.059
ARE WE DONE SHARING?

10:29.059 --> 10:30.260
OH, YEAH.

10:33.003 --> 10:36.366
(Irina giggles)
 WOW.
SO PARIS, PRAGUE, MADRID--

10:36.366 --> 10:38.839
IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU GUYS SAW EVERYTHING.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.411
BUT YOU STILL HAVEN'T TOLD US
HOW YOU TWO MET.

10:41.411 --> 10:45.876
WELL, UH, THE FIRST TIME I SAW
IRINA WAS ON A BEACH IN NICE.

10:45.876 --> 10:48.118
IT, WAS, UH,
HOW YOU SAY IN ENGLISH?

10:48.118 --> 10:50.080
THE... (mutters)

10:50.080 --> 10:51.722
T-TOPLESS?

10:51.722 --> 10:53.223
YES! (laughs)

10:53.223 --> 10:55.355
(chuckles)
 OH, YOU REALLY DID
SEE EVERYTHING.

10:55.355 --> 10:59.730
I WAS SO EMBARRASSED TO SHOW
MY BREASTS IN PUBLIC.

10:59.730 --> 11:02.262
WELL, CLEARLY,
YOU'VE GOTTEN OVER THAT.

11:02.262 --> 11:03.964
SWEETIE?
 HMM?

11:03.964 --> 11:06.036
WOULD YOU GIVE ME A HAND?

11:06.036 --> 11:08.138
OH, SURE. ARE YOU FINISHED?

11:08.138 --> 11:10.901
OH, THANKS, MOM.
 UH-HUH.

11:10.901 --> 11:14.204
(whispering) WHY ARE YOU
BEING SO RUDE?

11:14.204 --> 11:16.206
(whispering)
BECAUSE I LOVE THAT BOY

11:16.206 --> 11:18.208
MORE THAN ANYTHING
IN THE WORLD,

11:18.208 --> 11:21.211
AND THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL
 HE COULD GET A WOMAN THAT HOT,

11:21.211 --> 11:23.053
SO WHAT DOES SHE WANT?

11:23.053 --> 11:25.055
FINE. HE'S DATING
OUT OF HIS LEAGUE.

11:25.055 --> 11:27.057
REMIND ME
TO HIGH-FIVE HIM LATER.

11:27.057 --> 11:30.020
NOW GET BACK OVER THERE
AND BE NICE.

11:31.421 --> 11:33.964
(normal voice)
HERE YOU GO.
 THANK YOU.

11:33.964 --> 11:36.967
MM-HMM.
 YOU HAVE GIVEN ME
SO MUCH BEAUTIFUL FOOD.

11:36.967 --> 11:40.070
YOU'RE WELCOME.
 (chuckles)

11:40.070 --> 11:43.804
AND YOU HAVE BEAUTIFUL BOOTS.

11:43.804 --> 11:46.036
PRESTON BUY THESE FOR ME
IN PARIS.

11:46.036 --> 11:48.238
300 EUROS--

11:48.238 --> 11:51.441
ALMOST $400 AMERICAN, YES?

11:51.441 --> 11:54.344
HUH. I REMEMBER
SENDING YOU MONEY IN PARIS

11:54.344 --> 11:56.046
FOR AN EMERGENCY.

11:56.046 --> 11:59.049
I DIDN'T REALIZE
IT INVOLVED FOOTWEAR.

11:59.049 --> 12:02.192
FINE. I'LL PAY YOU BACK
OUT OF MY COLLEGE FUND.

12:02.192 --> 12:05.155
YOUR SON IS SO GENEROUS.

12:05.155 --> 12:07.197
YOU KNOW,
HE PROMISED TO TAKE ME

12:07.197 --> 12:11.932
TO THE SHOPPING SPREE
IN REAL AMERICAN MALL?

12:11.932 --> 12:15.405
I HEAR PEOPLE PAY $80
FOR T-SHIRT.

12:15.405 --> 12:18.308
WELL, HERE IN AMERICA,

12:18.308 --> 12:23.113
PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY A LOT
FOR BEAUTIFUL THINGS.

12:25.175 --> 12:28.178
(water draining)
 I'M SORRY.
THE WATER WAS RUNNING.

12:28.178 --> 12:30.851
DID YOU JUST SAY KATHERINE
IS A LEPRECHAUN?

12:30.851 --> 12:33.954
LESBIAN.
KATHERINE IS A LESBIAN.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.226
OKAY. THE FIRST ONE
MADE MORE SENSE.

12:36.226 --> 12:38.288
APPARENTLY,
THE OTHER NIGHT,

12:38.288 --> 12:42.292
KATHERINE AND ROBIN
GOT A LITTLE DRUNK--
 HOLD IT. ROBIN?

12:42.292 --> 12:46.196
YEAH.
SHE'S A LEPRECHAUN, TOO.

12:46.196 --> 12:47.397
WOW.

12:47.397 --> 12:49.439
KATHERINE AND ROBIN.

12:49.439 --> 12:51.101
OKAY. OKAY.

12:51.101 --> 12:54.444
YOU--YOU COULD JUST GET
THE IMAGE OUT OF YOUR HEAD,

12:54.444 --> 12:57.507
OR I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU
ANYTHING ELSE.
 THIS IS TOO WEIRD.

12:57.507 --> 12:59.379
WELL...

12:59.379 --> 13:02.482
A LOT OF PEOPLE DISCOVER
THEY'RE GAY LATER IN LIFE.

13:02.482 --> 13:05.485
NO, I MEAN, HOW COULD SHE GO
FROM BEING WITH ME

13:05.485 --> 13:09.259
TO BEING WITH WOMEN?
 OH, MIKE, SHE WAS PROBABLY
LEANING THAT WAY ALREADY.

13:09.259 --> 13:12.823
SHE WAS LUCKY TO HAVE YOU.
YOU WERE A NICE TRANSITION.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.495
WHAT?

13:15.495 --> 13:17.197
WELL, YOU KNOW, UH,

13:17.197 --> 13:20.100
I-I MEAN,
WHEN YOU MAKE LOVE,

13:20.100 --> 13:23.103
YOU'RE SO GENTLE
AND YOU LIKE TO CUDDLE AND...

13:23.103 --> 13:26.806
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
THAT I MAKE LOVE LIKE A WOMAN?

13:26.806 --> 13:29.439
NO, NO. I'M SAYING...

13:29.439 --> 13:32.142
THAT YOU ARE
A WELL-BALANCED MAN

13:32.142 --> 13:34.945
WHO'S IN TOUCH
WITH HIS FEMININE SIDE.

13:34.945 --> 13:37.217
I DON'T EVEN HAVE
A FEMININE SIDE.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.289
MIKE, COME ON.

13:39.289 --> 13:41.421
I--IT'S WHAT I LOVE
ABOUT YOU.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.393
YOU CRY AT MOVIES.

13:43.393 --> 13:46.256
MOVIE. ONE MOVIE--
"BRIAN'S SONG."

13:46.256 --> 13:48.258
AND "THE NOTEBOOK."

13:48.258 --> 13:50.260
TEARS OF BOREDOM.

13:50.260 --> 13:52.062
MIKE.

13:52.062 --> 13:56.036
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

13:56.036 --> 13:58.208
WHY IS DADDY YELLING?

13:58.208 --> 14:03.173
HE MAY HAVE TURNED A WOMAN
INTO A LEPRECHAUN.

14:05.175 --> 14:08.118
LOOK, YOU CAN COMPLAIN
ABOUT IRINA ALL YOU LIKE.

14:08.118 --> 14:09.849
I-I THINK SHE'S NICE.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.851
PLEASE.
YOUR OPINION OF HER WAS SET

14:11.851 --> 14:15.055
ONCE YOU HEARD THE WORD
"TOPLESS."
 (earrings clatter)

14:15.055 --> 14:17.988
THAT REMINDS ME. DID PRESTON
TAKE ANY PICTURES ON THIS TRIP?

14:17.988 --> 14:22.532
(scoffs) TOM, I WAS THERE WHEN
SHE UNPACKED HER SUITCASE.

14:22.532 --> 14:25.535
(imitates Irina) PRESTON BUY ME
THIS. PRESTON BUY ME THAT.

14:25.535 --> 14:28.268
(normal voice) I AM TELLING YOU,
THAT WOMAN IS...

14:28.268 --> 14:31.301
(imitates Irina) HOW DO YOU SAY?
A GOLD DIGGER.

14:31.301 --> 14:32.973
(laughs)

14:32.973 --> 14:36.176
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE RIGHT,
SHE'LL MOVE ON SOON ENOUGH.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.308
(sighs) YEAH.
 (knock on door)

14:38.308 --> 14:39.309
YEAH?

14:39.309 --> 14:42.452
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU GUYS.

14:42.452 --> 14:46.456
I KNOW THAT LOOK.
HE'S COME TO HIS SENSES.

14:46.456 --> 14:50.490
I PROPOSED TO IRINA,
AND SHE SAID YES.

14:50.490 --> 14:53.123
(whispers) OKAY, I DON'T KNOW
THAT LOOK AT ALL.

14:53.123 --> 14:55.295
YOU PROPOSED?

14:55.295 --> 14:58.198
BUT YOU'VE ONLY KNOWN EACH OTHER
FOR A FEW MONTHS.

14:58.198 --> 15:01.531
YEAH. BUT SHE'S THE ONE.
I KNOW IT.

15:01.531 --> 15:04.674
(normal voice) OH, HONEY.

15:04.674 --> 15:06.506
WAKE UP.

15:06.506 --> 15:09.940
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?
 W-W--YOUR--YOUR MOTHER'S
JUST CONCERNED

15:09.940 --> 15:13.683
THAT IRINA MIGHT BE WITH YOU
FOR THE WRONG REASONS.

15:13.683 --> 15:16.987
LIKE YOUR COLLEGE FUND.
WHY'D YOU TELL HER ABOUT THAT?

15:16.987 --> 15:18.418
WOW. WOW.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.991
YOU MUST REALLY THINK
I'M AN IDIOT.

15:20.991 --> 15:22.292
I THINK YOU'RE YOUNG.

15:22.292 --> 15:26.156
AND I'M SORRY. SOMETIMES YOUNG
IS IDIOT-ADJACENT.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.460
YOU DON'T APPROVE?

15:30.460 --> 15:33.603
FINE.
I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.

15:33.603 --> 15:35.605
BUT I WANT NANA'S RING.

15:35.605 --> 15:39.239
NO! YOU WANT TO BUY THAT WOMAN
BOOTS, I CAN'T STOP YOU,

15:39.239 --> 15:41.972
BUT SHE IS NOT GETTING
MY GRANDMOTHER'S RING.

15:41.972 --> 15:45.545
NANA PROMISED I COULD HAVE
THAT RING WHEN I GOT MARRIED.

15:45.545 --> 15:48.248
YOU DON'T GET A SAY.
 OH!

15:48.248 --> 15:50.320
HEY.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.222
YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE.

15:52.222 --> 15:55.385
YEAH, WELL, MAYBE THE MISTAKE
I MADE WAS COMING HOME.

15:55.385 --> 15:58.058
(door closes)

16:04.664 --> 16:06.696
(telephones ringing)

16:06.696 --> 16:09.169
GOD, YOUR FRIEND OWNS
THIS PLACE?

16:09.169 --> 16:11.171
IT'S PRETTY SWANK.

16:11.171 --> 16:14.204
YEAH, WE USED TO CALL IT
"THE HOUSE THAT BULIMIA BUILT."

16:14.204 --> 16:16.206
UGH. I COULD HAVE
NEVER BEEN A MODEL.

16:16.206 --> 16:18.208
I LIKE FOOD TOO MUCH.

16:18.208 --> 16:19.609
YEAH, THAT'S WHY.

16:23.183 --> 16:26.316
HEY. CAN SOMEBODY GET ME
A COFFEE LATER?

16:26.316 --> 16:29.719
HOLY CRAP.
IS THAT HEIDI KLUM?

16:29.719 --> 16:31.521
HEY.

16:31.521 --> 16:34.064
YEAH. HMM.

16:34.064 --> 16:36.366
DO YOU WANNA MEET HER?
 GET OUT.

16:36.366 --> 16:38.668
SURE.
SHE'S AN OLD FRIEND.

16:38.668 --> 16:41.531
COME ON. HEIDI.

16:41.531 --> 16:43.273
HEY.
(singsong voice) HEIDI!

16:43.273 --> 16:45.535
(chuckles) HI.
IT'S ME, GABY.

16:47.677 --> 16:49.539
GABRIELLE MARQUEZ.

16:49.539 --> 16:51.241
I REMEMBER YOU.

16:51.241 --> 16:53.343
IT'S HARD TO FORGET SOMEONE
WHO TAPED TOILET PAPER

16:53.343 --> 16:55.345
TO THE BOTTOM
OF MY MANOLO BLAHNIKS

16:55.345 --> 16:57.647
AND LAUGHED
WHEN I WALKED DOWN THE RUNWAY.

16:57.647 --> 16:59.219
(chuckles nervously)
I WAS--

16:59.219 --> 17:03.193
I WAS QUITE
THE PRACTICAL JOKER BACK THEN.

17:03.193 --> 17:07.257
ANYWAY, UH, THIS IS MY FRIEND,
ANGIE BOLEN, FROM FAIRVIEW.

17:07.257 --> 17:09.229
PRACTICAL JOKE, MY ASS.
BECAUSE OF YOU,

17:09.229 --> 17:12.232
I DIDN'T GET TO BE ON THE COVER
OF "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED."

17:12.232 --> 17:15.605
SO SCREW YOU, SCREW YOUR FRIEND
AND SCREW FAIRVIEW.

17:19.108 --> 17:22.172
SHE SEEMS NICE.

17:22.172 --> 17:24.344
GABRIELLE!

17:24.344 --> 17:27.146
LUKE!
 OHH!

17:27.146 --> 17:29.719
(kisses) HELLO, GORGEOUS!

17:29.719 --> 17:32.122
HI.
THIS IS MY NEIGHBOR ANGIE.

17:32.122 --> 17:34.584
OH. WELL, NICE CHEEKBONES.

17:34.584 --> 17:38.458
NOW WHAT THE HELL IS UP WITH
THAT SNOTTY NIECE OF YOURS?

17:38.458 --> 17:40.460
I MEAN,
DON'T GET ME WRONG--

17:40.460 --> 17:43.233
SHE'S GIFTED AND SHE'S GOT
THE LOOK--BUT THAT ATTITUDE!

17:43.233 --> 17:45.235
TELL ME ABOUT IT.
 HMM.

17:45.235 --> 17:49.239
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE SHE
IS? SHE'S NOT IN HER APARTMENT.
 YOUR NIECE
WALKED OFF A SHOOT.

17:49.239 --> 17:52.071
HER BOYFRIEND,
BROODY McFINE ASS SHOWED UP,

17:52.071 --> 17:55.105
TOLD HER THAT HE HAD RELATIVES
IN TOWN THEY COULD STAY WITH.

17:55.105 --> 17:56.406
SHORT STORY SHORTER--

17:56.406 --> 18:00.250
I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE WENT
AND DON'T CARE.

18:00.250 --> 18:03.813
YOU HAVE RELATIVES
IN NEW YORK?

18:03.813 --> 18:06.386
ONLY ONE.

18:06.386 --> 18:09.489
(doorbell buzzes)

18:09.489 --> 18:11.291
(Rose) WHO'S THERE?

18:11.291 --> 18:13.663
IT'S ME, MA.

18:13.663 --> 18:15.295
(lock clicks)

18:27.337 --> 18:29.339
(loud slap)

18:37.147 --> 18:39.819
WHAT?

18:39.819 --> 18:42.822
I FINALLY GET TO MEET
MY GRANDSON FOR THE FIRST TIME,

18:42.822 --> 18:45.825
AND NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT HE HAS TO GO?

18:45.825 --> 18:48.858
YOU KNOW
IT IS NOT SAFE HERE, MA.
 HERE'S WHAT I KNOW--

18:48.858 --> 18:52.232
EVERY NIGHT,
FOR THE PAST 18 YEARS,

18:52.232 --> 18:54.334
I WAS THE ONLY ONE
AT THIS TABLE.

18:54.334 --> 18:59.269
YEAH. ONE PLATE, ONE CUP,
ONE CHAIR.

18:59.269 --> 19:01.471
AND THEN SOMEONE KNOCKS
ON MY DOOR,

19:01.471 --> 19:03.713
AND THEY SIT RIGHT THERE.

19:03.713 --> 19:06.876
(voice breaks)
AND HE CALLS ME "GRANDMA."

19:06.876 --> 19:09.879
I COULD HAVE LOOKED AT HIM
TILL MY EYES DRIED UP.

19:09.879 --> 19:12.682
AND NOW YOU SHOW UP, AND YOU
TELL ME IT'S NOT SAFE.

19:12.682 --> 19:15.285
WHY? THE FEDS DON'T CARE
ABOUT HIM.

19:15.285 --> 19:18.228
IT'S NOT THE FEDS
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

19:18.228 --> 19:21.561
(gasps) OH, SO THAT'S WHY
YOU WANT TO TAKE HIM AWAY.

19:21.561 --> 19:23.293
PATRICK LOGAN?

19:23.293 --> 19:26.165
IF MY KID SHOWS UP,
HE S A DIRECT LINK TO ME.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.838
THAT'S HOW HE'LL FIND ME.
 THAT WAS 18 YEARS AGO.

19:28.838 --> 19:31.301
PATRICK LOGAN DOES NOT CARE
ABOUT YOU,

19:31.301 --> 19:35.875
AND HE SURE AS HELL DOES NOT
CARE ABOUT MY GRANDSON!

19:35.875 --> 19:38.308
MA, PLEASE.

19:40.350 --> 19:42.852
I'LL TELL DANNY
 YOU WERE HERE.

19:53.763 --> 19:56.366
ROBIN THE STRIPPER?

19:56.366 --> 19:58.428
YOU HAD SEX
WITH ROBIN THE STRIPPER?

19:58.428 --> 20:01.971
HOLY CHAZ BONO.
 WAS THAT THE FIRST TIME
YOU EVER...

20:01.971 --> 20:03.273
YES.

20:03.273 --> 20:05.235
AND ROBIN'S
AT HER COUSIN'S WEDDING,

20:05.235 --> 20:08.438
SO I ONLY HAVE A COUPLE OF DAYS
TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

20:08.438 --> 20:09.979
AM I GAY NOW?

20:11.581 --> 20:13.583
WELL, DID YOU ENJOY IT?

20:13.583 --> 20:16.416
I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS DIFFERENT.

20:16.416 --> 20:19.319
I MEAN, WE STARTED KISSING,
AND THEN WE--

20:19.319 --> 20:21.521
N-NO D-DETAILS NECESSARY.

20:23.253 --> 20:25.355
KATHERINE, YOU'RE NOT GAY.

20:25.355 --> 20:28.358
AS MUCH AS YOU THINK
YOU CAN SWITCH YOUR ENTREE

20:28.358 --> 20:30.560
FROM MEAT TO FISH,
IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.

20:30.560 --> 20:33.263
THIS IS NOT A CHOICE.

20:33.263 --> 20:36.336
BUT HOW COULD THIS HAVE
HAPPENED IF I'M NOT GAY?

20:36.336 --> 20:39.269
LOOK, I WAS WITH WOMEN
ALL THROUGH MY 20s...

20:39.269 --> 20:42.011
ANY EXCUSE
TO DRAG THAT OUT.

20:42.011 --> 20:44.013
BUT IT ALWAYS FELT WEIRD.

20:44.013 --> 20:46.946
THEN WHEN I SLEPT WITH A MAN,
I KNEW THAT WAS IT.

20:46.946 --> 20:49.018
THEN A THOUSAND MEN LATER,
HE FOUND ME.

20:49.018 --> 20:52.522
MY POINT IS, IF IT DIDN'T FEEL
QUITE RIGHT TO YOU,

20:52.522 --> 20:55.325
CHANCES ARE
IT'S JUST A ONETIME THING.

20:55.325 --> 20:56.856
OH, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.429
WE WERE BOTH PRETTY DRUNK.

20:59.429 --> 21:03.433
IF YOU'RE NOT SURE, TAKE SEX
OUT OF IT. GET TO KNOW ROBIN.

21:03.433 --> 21:05.365
I-IT'S A LITTLE LATE
TO START DATING.

21:05.365 --> 21:07.297
WE ALREADY LIVE TOGETHER.

21:07.297 --> 21:09.299
THAT IS FAST.

21:09.299 --> 21:11.301
MAYBE YOU ARE A LESBIAN.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.975
AND IN THE SHORT TIME
HE'S BEEN HERE,

21:15.975 --> 21:18.378
SAM HAS PROVED HIMSELF
INVALUABLE.

21:18.378 --> 21:20.880
SO I WOULD LIKE YOU ALL
TO GIVE YOUR SUPPORT

21:20.880 --> 21:23.413
TO OUR NEW VICE PRESIDENT.

21:23.413 --> 21:25.585
THANK YOU.
THIS IS A GREAT COMPANY,

21:25.585 --> 21:28.358
BUT I THINK WE CAN MAKE IT
EVEN BETTER.

21:28.358 --> 21:30.360
NOW I'VE GOT
A LOT OF GREAT--

21:33.022 --> 21:36.396
OH, OH, SORRY. I WAS JUST,
UH, SHOWING MY SUPPORT.

21:36.396 --> 21:38.568
CARRY ON.

21:38.568 --> 21:40.299
ANDREW, IS THAT BEER?
 (beer swishes)

21:40.299 --> 21:42.301
HEY, JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
HAVE A LIQUID LUNCH,

21:42.301 --> 21:45.304
DOESN'T MEAN THE REST OF US
HAVE TO SUFFER.
 (whispers) ANDREW.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.577
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.
I'VE GOT THIS.

21:49.879 --> 21:52.342
OKAY, BUDDY, WHY DON'T
WE GET YOU SOME COFFEE?

21:52.342 --> 21:55.084
WHY DON'T WE NOT?
OH, BESIDES,

21:55.084 --> 21:57.647
I-I BELIEVE EVERYBODY IS
WAITING TO HEAR

21:57.647 --> 22:00.490
HOW YOU'RE GONNA SPRINKLE
YOUR MAGIC FAIRY DUST

22:00.490 --> 22:03.393
AND WHIP THIS COMPANY
INTO SHAPE. AM I RIGHT?
 OKAY, YOU NEED TO GO NOW.

22:03.393 --> 22:06.426
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME!
 (loud clatter)

22:06.426 --> 22:08.327
ANDREW!

22:09.999 --> 22:12.962
SAM, ARE YOU OKAY?

22:12.962 --> 22:15.334
(clears throat)

22:15.334 --> 22:16.636
I'M FINE.

22:16.636 --> 22:18.638
BUT IF YOU DON'T MIND,

22:18.638 --> 22:22.942
I THINK I'LL TAKE
THE REST OF THE DAY OFF.

22:22.942 --> 22:26.476
(door opens and closes)

22:26.476 --> 22:30.880
SEE?
TOLD YOU HE WAS A SLACKER.

22:38.458 --> 22:40.129
LYNETTE,
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

22:40.129 --> 22:42.832
HEY, JIMMY.
MY SON CAME HOME FROM EUROPE

22:42.832 --> 22:45.635
AND IS ENGAGED
TO A BEAUTIFUL RUSSIAN GIRL.

22:45.635 --> 22:46.966
CONGRATULATIONS.

22:46.966 --> 22:48.998
I HATE HER.
 OKAY.

22:48.998 --> 22:52.041
ANYWAY, THIS IS
MY GRANDMOTHER'S RING,

22:52.041 --> 22:56.446
AND PRESTON WANTS
TO GIVE IT TO HER.
 SHE'S VERY LUCKY.

22:56.446 --> 22:59.609
OH, SHE'S NOT GETTING THIS...
 OKAY.

22:59.609 --> 23:01.851
BECAUSE YOU ARE GONNA FIND ME
A CHEAP COPY.

23:01.851 --> 23:03.513
OH, I CAN TRY,

23:03.513 --> 23:06.986
BUT SHE'S PROBABLY GONNA
KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.
 OH, I'M COUNTING ON IT.

23:06.986 --> 23:09.419
IRINA IS
QUITE THE OPPORTUNIST.

23:09.419 --> 23:11.421
FIVE SECONDS
AFTER SHE GETS IT,

23:11.421 --> 23:13.423
SHE'LL HAVE THAT PIECE OF GLASS
APPRAISED,

23:13.423 --> 23:16.826
AND WHEN SHE FINDS OUT MY SON
HAS GIVEN HER A... (gasps) FAKE,

23:16.826 --> 23:20.399
I'M BETTING THAT LITTLE
RUSSIAN PARASITE WILL BE LOOKING

23:20.399 --> 23:23.703
FOR A NEW HOST BODY.
 BUT WHEN YOUR SON FINDS OUT,
ISN'T HE GONNA BE MAD?

23:23.703 --> 23:26.135
OH, THAT'S WHY I KEEP
HAVING KIDS, JIMMY,

23:26.135 --> 23:29.108
TO REPLACE THE ONES
WHO HATE ME.

23:29.108 --> 23:32.982
M.J.'s ASLEEP.

23:32.982 --> 23:34.884
ARE YOU COMING TO BED?

23:36.916 --> 23:39.018
I MISS YOU.

23:39.018 --> 23:41.851
WHAT, YOU, UH, NEED SOMEBODY
TO DO YOUR HAIR?

23:41.851 --> 23:45.955
YOU KNOW, US SENSITIVE MEN
ARE GOOD AT THAT.

23:45.955 --> 23:47.727
PLEASE DON'T POUT.

23:47.727 --> 23:50.500
YOU ARE ALL MAN.

23:50.500 --> 23:53.533
YOU'RE ONE OF THE STRONGEST,
MOST MACHO MEN I KNOW.

23:53.533 --> 23:54.704
(kisses)

23:54.704 --> 23:56.165
NOW COME UPSTAIRS.

23:59.208 --> 24:02.472
I DON'T HAVE TO COME UPSTAIRS
TO SHOW YOU THAT.

24:02.472 --> 24:06.075
OH! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
 I CAN SHOW YOU HOW MACHO I AM
RIGHT HERE.

24:06.075 --> 24:09.448
OH. DON'T YOU THINK OUR BED IS
A BIT MORE COMFORTABLE?

24:09.448 --> 24:13.623
MM. BEDS ARE FOR WIMPS.
 OKAY, THAT WAS M.J.'s LUNCH.

24:13.623 --> 24:15.885
NOW I'M GETTING RID
OF THIS T-SHIRT.
 (laughs)

24:15.885 --> 24:18.528
(grunts)

24:18.528 --> 24:21.691
GOD, WHAT IS THIS MADE OF?
 OH, HERE. LET ME TAKE IT OFF.

24:21.691 --> 24:23.092
NO.
 OH.

24:23.092 --> 24:25.034
I'M RIPPING IT.
 OH, MIKE,

24:25.034 --> 24:28.167
YOU--YOU DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO PROVE. YOU--
 WHERE ARE THE SCISSORS?

24:28.167 --> 24:30.970
I JUST WANT TO MAKE
A LITTLE STARTER CUT. AAH!
 OH. ARE YOU OKAY?

24:30.970 --> 24:33.703
OH, YEAH, YEAH. I'M FINE.
I LIKE IT ROUGH.
 OH.

24:33.703 --> 24:36.706
AAH!
 OH! I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE HAVING
FUN, BUT MY BACK IS HURTING,

24:36.706 --> 24:39.709
SO LET ME GET ON TOP.
 NO. NO. I'M ON TOP.

24:39.709 --> 24:41.881
SERIOUSLY, MIKE.
I'M ON A SALT SHAKER.

24:41.881 --> 24:43.683
(thud)

24:43.683 --> 24:46.986
(grunts)
 OH, SWEETIE. ARE YOU OKAY?

24:46.986 --> 24:49.819
NO, NOT REALLY.

24:49.819 --> 24:51.821
HONESTLY, IF I HAD KNOWN

24:51.821 --> 24:55.264
THAT YOU WERE GONNA GET
THIS UPSET ABOUT KATHERINE--

24:55.264 --> 24:57.597
IT'S NOT ABOUT KATHERINE.
IT'S YOU.

24:57.597 --> 25:00.600
AND IT'S NOT EVEN REALLY
ABOUT YOU. IT'S ME.

25:00.600 --> 25:03.232
OKAY, JUST HOW HARD
DID YOU HIT YOUR HEAD?

25:03.232 --> 25:05.004
THE LOAN.

25:05.004 --> 25:08.137
SUSAN,
YOU PAID OFF MY LOAN.

25:09.779 --> 25:12.542
WELL,
ISN'T THAT A LITTLE, UH,

25:12.542 --> 25:15.214
1956 OF YOU?

25:15.214 --> 25:18.517
I GREW UP...

25:18.517 --> 25:22.722
WATCHING A MAN WHO DIDN'T
PROVIDE FOR HIS FAMILY,

25:22.722 --> 25:26.826
AND I ALWAYS SWORE THAT WAS
ONE THING I WAS GONNA DO.

25:26.826 --> 25:29.528
I'LL NEVER BE RICH,

25:29.528 --> 25:31.130
I'LL NEVER BE FAMOUS,

25:31.130 --> 25:36.035
BUT I CAN BE A GUY
WHO TAKES CARE OF HIS FAMILY.

25:36.035 --> 25:40.269
WELL, IN THAT CASE,

25:40.269 --> 25:44.073
I WILL CANCEL THE CHECK
TOMORROW,

25:44.073 --> 25:48.317
AND YOU CAN PAY THE LOAN OFF
BY YOURSELF.

25:48.317 --> 25:50.179
THANK YOU.

25:51.821 --> 25:54.924
HEY,
YOU KNOW THAT 1956 THING?

25:54.924 --> 25:57.056
HMM?

25:57.056 --> 25:59.128
IT'S KINDA SEXY.

25:59.128 --> 26:00.690
REALLY?
 MM-HMM.

26:00.690 --> 26:03.332
MM.
 (giggles)

26:05.865 --> 26:08.267
ANA, THIS IS
MY 17th MESSAGE.

26:08.267 --> 26:10.770
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
PICK UP THE PHONE,

26:10.770 --> 26:13.773
BECAUSE I AM NOT LEAVING
NEW YORK UNTIL I SEE YOU.
 (closes cell phone)

26:13.773 --> 26:16.676
TELL ME. WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU PLANNING TO DO?

26:16.676 --> 26:19.148
(wine pours)
 FIND ANA,
CUT THE PURSE STRINGS,

26:19.148 --> 26:22.351
DESTROY HER HOPES AND DREAMS
AND CATCH A BROADWAY SHOW.

26:22.351 --> 26:24.884
OH, MY GOSH!

26:24.884 --> 26:27.086
HI, GUYS! (chuckles)

26:27.086 --> 26:30.319
HI! OH, UM, ANGIE,
YOU MET LUKE,

26:30.319 --> 26:32.191
AND OF COURSE YOU RECOGNIZE

26:32.191 --> 26:34.263
THE BEAUTIFUL
PAULINA PORIZKOVA.

26:34.263 --> 26:37.166
SHE AND I GO WAY BACK.

26:37.166 --> 26:40.099
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?
GIVE ME A HUG.
 WHY?

26:40.099 --> 26:44.373
WHAT'S WRONG?
 YOU TREATED ME LIKE DIRT,
AND NOW YOU WANT A HUG?

26:44.373 --> 26:47.236
(chuckles) WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

26:47.236 --> 26:49.308
YOU REMEMBER
ALL THE FUN WE HAD

26:49.308 --> 26:52.381
DOING THAT PHOTO SHOOT
ON THE BEACH IN BRAZIL.
 WHAT I REMEMBER IS
GETTING YOU THAT JOB

26:52.381 --> 26:54.383
WHEN YOU WERE JUST
STARTING OUT

26:54.383 --> 26:56.716
AND THEN FREEZING ON THE SAND
FOR THREE HOURS

26:56.716 --> 26:58.718
WHILE YOU BITCHED
BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T FIND

26:58.718 --> 27:01.250
THE EXACT RIGHT SHADE
OF LIPSTICK

27:01.250 --> 27:03.893
THAT WOULD MAKE YOU
LOOK PRETTY.

27:03.893 --> 27:06.395
I SEE YOU STILL
HAVEN'T FOUND IT.

27:08.758 --> 27:10.229
YOU KNOW...

27:10.229 --> 27:13.162
I REALLY DON'T THINK I NEED TO
MEET ANY MORE OF YOUR FRIENDS.

27:13.162 --> 27:15.104
I'M GONNA GO CALL NICK.

27:15.104 --> 27:17.366
(scoffs)
CAN YOU BELIEVE PAULINA?

27:17.366 --> 27:19.068
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

27:19.068 --> 27:21.240
OH, YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

27:21.240 --> 27:22.371
(scoffs)

27:22.371 --> 27:25.344
OKAY, MAYBE I THREW A LITTLE
ATTITUDE ONCE IN A WHILE.

27:25.344 --> 27:27.917
YOU DIDN'T THROW IT, HONEY.
YOU HEAVED IT.

27:27.917 --> 27:31.781
OH, COME ON. I WAS NO WORSE
THAN A LOT OF OTHER GIRLS.

27:31.781 --> 27:35.284
NO, SWEETIE, YOU WERE
THE QUEEN BITCH DIVA--

27:35.284 --> 27:37.757
INSULTING PHOTOGRAPHERS,
UPSETTING BOOKING AGENTS.

27:37.757 --> 27:40.359
(whispers) THAT'S WHY YOUR
CAREER WENT DOWN IN FLAMES.

27:40.359 --> 27:43.432
NO. MY CAREER ENDED BECAUSE
I DECIDED TO MARRY CARLOS.

27:43.432 --> 27:46.866
YOU REMEMBER. I CALLED YOU
THE NIGHT HE PROPOSED.

27:46.866 --> 27:50.139
YEAH, AND I TOLD YOU
TO GRAB THAT BRASS RING.

27:50.139 --> 27:52.802
BECAUSE I KNEW
IT WAS OVER FOR YOU,

27:52.802 --> 27:55.374
AND YOU DID, TOO,

27:55.374 --> 27:58.347
OR ELSE
YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE LEFT.

28:01.110 --> 28:02.251
(kisses)

28:12.191 --> 28:15.294
EXCUSE ME? I THINK
I'M IN THE WRONG PLACE.

28:15.294 --> 28:17.296
DOES SAM ALLEN LIVE HERE?

28:17.296 --> 28:19.799
THAT ONE.
BUT HE'S NOT HERE.

28:19.799 --> 28:22.471
OH. THEN I GUESS I'LL JUST, UH,
LEAVE THESE ON HIS PORCH.

28:22.471 --> 28:24.473
IF YOU WANT THE DOGS
TO EAT IT.

28:24.473 --> 28:27.276
PUT IT INSIDE.
IT'S UNLOCKED.

28:27.276 --> 28:29.038
(door creaks open)

29:08.417 --> 29:10.820
(Sam) MRS. HODGE?

29:12.852 --> 29:15.224
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH A PICTURE OF REX?

29:18.087 --> 29:19.959
I'M WAITING.

29:19.959 --> 29:22.331
HE WAS MY FATHER.

29:22.331 --> 29:25.364
WHAT?

29:25.364 --> 29:29.368
THIS IS NOT HOW I WANTED YOU
TO FIND OUT. I AM SO SORRY.

29:35.274 --> 29:39.408
BREE, LET ME EXPLAIN.
 (engine starts)

29:48.918 --> 29:51.891
IRINA REALLY LOVED THE RING,
MOM. THAT'S WHY SHE WANTED

29:51.891 --> 29:55.094
TO GO RIGHT TO A JEWELER,
TO GET IT SIZED.
 GOOD.

29:55.094 --> 29:57.326
LISTEN, I KNOW
I SPRANG THIS ON YOU,

29:57.326 --> 30:00.329
BUT ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW HER,
YOU'LL SEE WHAT I SEE IN HER.

30:00.329 --> 30:03.502
I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO
WHEN WE BOTH SEE THE SAME THING.

30:03.502 --> 30:05.274
HELLO, EVERYONE.

30:05.274 --> 30:06.976
(Tom) HEY, IRINA.
 (Lynette) HEY.

30:06.976 --> 30:09.408
(chuckles)
 MMM. MMM.

30:09.408 --> 30:11.380
YOU HUNGRY?
MOM MADE LENTIL SOUP.

30:11.380 --> 30:14.383
I TOLD HER
IT WAS YOUR FAVORITE.
 OH, YOUR MOTHER'S
FULL OF THOUGHTS.

30:14.383 --> 30:16.485
OH, IN ENGLISH,
WE SAY "THOUGHTFUL."

30:16.485 --> 30:19.388
YES.
 OH, YOU'RE NOT WEARING
YOUR RING.

30:19.388 --> 30:23.422
GEE, I HOPE
THERE'S NOT A PROBLEM.

30:23.422 --> 30:27.456
I AM ALL DAY THINKING
ABOUT THIS RING.

30:27.456 --> 30:29.458
I DO NOT WANT IT.

30:31.360 --> 30:34.303
BUT... PRESTON SAID
YOU LOVED IT.

30:34.303 --> 30:35.905
I DO,

30:35.905 --> 30:38.437
BUT IT IS TOO PRECIOUS.

30:38.437 --> 30:41.610
THIS RING HAS BEEN
IN YOUR FAMILY FOR GENERATIONS,

30:41.610 --> 30:45.174
AND FOR YOU TO GIVE IT
TO WOMAN YOU DON'T KNOW,

30:45.174 --> 30:46.976
IT FEELS WRONG.

30:46.976 --> 30:49.518
(whispers)
SAVE IT FOR PENNY.

30:49.518 --> 30:52.181
WOW.
WHAT A CLASSY THING TO DO.

30:52.181 --> 30:53.953
THANK YOU, IRINA.

30:53.953 --> 30:56.285
YOU CAN BUY ME ANOTHER RING.

30:56.285 --> 30:58.857
YOU SURE?
NANA'S RING IS WORTH A LOT MORE

30:58.857 --> 31:01.860
THAN ANYTHING I CAN AFFORD.

31:01.860 --> 31:04.994
YES, PRESTON. I KNOW EXACTLY
HOW MUCH IT IS WORTH.

31:04.994 --> 31:07.997
BUT I WANT YOUR MOTHER
TO KNOW

31:07.997 --> 31:11.901
I AM FULL OF THOUGHTS, TOO.

31:13.642 --> 31:16.645
SO... LET'S EAT.

31:16.645 --> 31:19.348
PRESTON, GET HER A CHAIR.
HERE YOU GO, HONEY.

31:19.348 --> 31:22.381
(Preston) YEAH,
DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT.
 YEAH, WE'RE HAVING
A LITTLE SALAD...

31:27.116 --> 31:30.119
(siren wailing in distance)

31:31.890 --> 31:33.993
WOW.

31:33.993 --> 31:38.467
2 VISITS IN 18 YEARS.
IT'S GETTIN' MONOTONOUS.

31:38.467 --> 31:40.329
I NEED TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING...

31:43.072 --> 31:45.174
ABOUT PATRICK.

31:47.306 --> 31:48.437
THIS AGAIN?

31:50.309 --> 31:52.041
FINE.

31:52.041 --> 31:53.342
(clatter)

31:53.342 --> 31:56.485
WHAT ABOUT THE GREAT
AND POWERFUL PATRICK LOGAN?

31:56.485 --> 32:00.919
FIRST YOU HAVE TO PROMISE
YOU WON'T EVER TELL DANNY.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.252
(horns honking)
 ANA!

32:03.252 --> 32:05.124
THERE YOU ARE!

32:05.124 --> 32:08.297
I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO YOU.
 WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
JUST GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES.

32:08.297 --> 32:10.629
IF YOU DON'T LIKE
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY,

32:10.629 --> 32:13.632
THEN YOU CAN TELL ME
TO GO TO HELL.
 TWO MINUTES.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.364
I'LL MEET YOU INSIDE.

32:17.266 --> 32:18.567
BEFORE YOU START,

32:18.567 --> 32:22.411
I KNOW YOU SENT ME TO NEW YORK
JUST TO GET ME AWAY FROM DANNY.

32:22.411 --> 32:26.075
TRUE. I BEGGED LUKE TO TAKE YOU,
AND HE DID ME A FAVOR.
 I KNEW IT.

32:26.075 --> 32:28.647
BUT IT TURNS OUT I WAS
DOING HIM A FAVOR, TOO,

32:28.647 --> 32:32.251
BECAUSE HE THINKS
YOU'RE REALLY TALENTED.
 HE SAID THAT?

32:32.251 --> 32:35.224
HE ALSO THINKS YOU'RE
A PETULANT, WHINY, SPOILED BRAT,

32:35.224 --> 32:38.057
JUST LIKE I WAS, AND THAT'S
GONNA KILL YOUR CAREER,

32:38.057 --> 32:41.390
JUST LIKE IT KILLED MINE.
 I THOUGHT YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL.

32:41.390 --> 32:44.963
I WAS, UNTIL EVERYONE WAS TIRED
OF PUTTING UP WITH MY CRAP.

32:44.963 --> 32:48.237
SO I WANT YOU TO GO BACK
TO LUKE, APOLOGIZE

32:48.237 --> 32:50.239
AND START ACTING
LIKE A PROFESSIONAL.

32:50.239 --> 32:52.241
MODELING CAN BE
A GREAT RIDE,

32:52.241 --> 32:56.075
AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE
KICKED OFF BEFORE IT'S OVER,

32:56.075 --> 32:58.707
LIKE I WAS.

33:04.183 --> 33:07.186
MOM, I KNOW YOU'RE HERE FOR ME,
BUT I'M NOT GOIN'.

33:07.186 --> 33:09.188
ALL RIGHT,
GRANDMA WANTS ME TO STAY.

33:11.720 --> 33:14.263
NO.

33:14.263 --> 33:16.025
I DON'T.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.529
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HER?

33:20.529 --> 33:22.531
SHE DIDN'T HAVE
TO SAY ANYTHING.

33:22.531 --> 33:24.533
YOUR MOTHER KNOWS
WHAT'S BEST.

33:29.178 --> 33:32.010
BUT...

33:32.010 --> 33:35.384
WE HAVE
A RELATIONSHIP NOW, HMM?

33:35.384 --> 33:38.217
WE'RE GONNA TALK
TO EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME.

33:38.217 --> 33:40.419
REALLY?

33:40.419 --> 33:43.452
I PROMISE.

33:43.452 --> 33:47.396
BUT AS LONG AS YOU'RE HERE,
NEITHER ONE OF US IS SAFE.

33:50.299 --> 33:52.731
NOW GO PACK YOUR STUFF.

34:01.170 --> 34:04.273
(horns honking)

34:07.116 --> 34:10.119
(dog barks)

34:10.119 --> 34:11.420
HI.

34:11.420 --> 34:13.422
DO YOU, BY ANY CHANCE,

34:13.422 --> 34:15.424
KNOW WHO THAT WOMAN IS
TALKING TO ROSE?

34:15.424 --> 34:17.426
YEAH,
THAT'S HER DAUGHTER ANGIE.

34:17.426 --> 34:20.389
REALLY? I HAVEN'T SEEN HER
AROUND HERE.

34:20.389 --> 34:22.391
WHERE--WHERE IS
SHE VISITING FROM?

34:22.391 --> 34:24.062
FAIRVIEW.

34:26.235 --> 34:29.067
HE'S STILL OUT THERE.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.440
YOU REALLY SHOULD TALK
TO HIM.

34:31.440 --> 34:34.373
(sighs)
I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY.

34:34.373 --> 34:36.145
BREE, HE'S 26.

34:36.145 --> 34:38.577
HE WAS BORN BEFORE
YOU AND REX WERE MARRIED.

34:38.577 --> 34:42.781
FIDELITY IS NOT THE ISSUE.
REX HAD A SECRET LIFE.

34:42.781 --> 34:45.484
FINE. BE MAD AT REX,
NOT AT THAT YOUNG MAN.

34:45.484 --> 34:48.187
HE'S INNOCENT.
 HE SHOWED UP TO WORK FOR ME

34:48.187 --> 34:51.560
AND DIDN'T TELL ME THAT HE WAS
MY DEAD HUSBAND'S SON.

34:51.560 --> 34:53.621
(sighs) WHAT DOES HE WANT?

34:53.621 --> 34:57.126
WELL, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT.

35:02.671 --> 35:05.274
YOU TOLD ME
YOU WANTED TO EXPLAIN.

35:05.274 --> 35:08.577
YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES.

35:08.577 --> 35:11.510
MY MOTHER AND FATHER
MET AT A BAR.

35:11.510 --> 35:14.483
HE WAS SINGLE, SO WAS SHE.

35:14.483 --> 35:16.845
THEY HAD ONE NIGHT TOGETHER,
AND THEN HE WENT AWAY.

35:16.845 --> 35:20.889
WHEN SHE FOUND OUT SHE WAS
PREGNANT, SHE CALLED HIM.

35:20.889 --> 35:24.723
HE HAD JUST MET YOU
AND SAID HE WAS IN LOVE.

35:24.723 --> 35:27.156
HE OFFERED TO SUPPORT HER
FINANCIALLY,

35:27.156 --> 35:30.429
BUT MY MOM,
WHO WAS VERY PROUD,

35:30.429 --> 35:32.461
TURNED HIM DOWN.

35:34.433 --> 35:36.805
BUT HE DID VISIT YOU.

35:36.805 --> 35:38.467
A FEW TIMES,

35:38.467 --> 35:41.640
BUT MY MOM ASKED HIM TO STOP
BECAUSE IT WAS TOO HARD ON ME.

35:43.342 --> 35:45.674
AND DID YOU EVER
SEE HIM AGAIN?

35:45.674 --> 35:47.746
YES.

35:47.746 --> 35:50.519
FROM RIGHT HERE.

35:50.519 --> 35:53.282
I USED TO RIDE MY BIKE OVER.

35:56.425 --> 35:59.928
I'D WATCH YOU
AND ANDREW AND DANIELLE.

36:02.461 --> 36:04.463
I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND

36:04.463 --> 36:07.466
WHY MY FATHER WOULD CHOOSE
ALL OF YOU OVER ME...

36:09.498 --> 36:11.440
AND I DID.

36:13.342 --> 36:16.345
YOU WERE ALL SO PERFECT.

36:16.345 --> 36:19.177
(chuckles)

36:19.177 --> 36:20.879
OH.

36:22.951 --> 36:26.485
MY MOM DIED SIX MONTHS AGO,

36:26.485 --> 36:29.558
AND THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED
I NEEDED TO MEET YOU.

36:29.558 --> 36:32.721
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
WHO YOU WERE?

36:32.721 --> 36:35.424
BECAUSE I WANTED YOU
TO LIKE ME...

36:37.926 --> 36:40.269
(whispers) AND I WASN'T SURE
YOU WOULD.

36:44.603 --> 36:47.476
YOU LOOK COLD.

36:47.476 --> 36:49.608
WHY DON'T YOU COME
INTO THE HOUSE,

36:49.608 --> 36:52.841
AND I'LL MAKE YOU SOME
HOT CHOCOLATE, AND WE CAN TALK?

37:10.899 --> 37:13.302
OH!

37:13.302 --> 37:15.003
HEY!

37:15.003 --> 37:17.506
YOU KNOW, NOT TO PUT
ANY PRESSURE ON YOU,

37:17.506 --> 37:19.508
BUT I CAUGHT THE BOUQUET.

37:19.508 --> 37:21.470
(chuckles nervously)

37:21.470 --> 37:23.972
OH.

37:23.972 --> 37:26.515
UM...

37:26.515 --> 37:29.518
DO WE NEED TO TALK?

37:29.518 --> 37:32.651
WE HAVEN'T SINCE...
IT HAPPENED. (chuckles)

37:32.651 --> 37:35.624
FIRST OF ALL,

37:35.624 --> 37:38.287
YOU ARE A WONDERFUL,
BEAUTIFUL PERSON.

37:38.287 --> 37:40.859
OH.

37:40.859 --> 37:42.531
YOWZA.

37:42.531 --> 37:44.533
I WAS DRUNK.

37:44.533 --> 37:47.536
I-I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I WAS
DOING UNTIL I WAS DOING IT,

37:47.536 --> 37:51.470
AND THEN, WELL...

37:51.470 --> 37:53.602
THE OTHER NIGHT
WAS A MISTAKE,

37:53.602 --> 37:56.605
AND I'M SO SORRY.

38:01.610 --> 38:03.612
(sighs) THAT IS...

38:03.612 --> 38:06.615
COMPLETE CRAP.

38:06.615 --> 38:09.488
WHAT?

38:09.488 --> 38:12.321
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU BLAME
WHAT HAPPENED ON BEING DRUNK.

38:12.321 --> 38:14.523
OKAY, THEN.

38:15.994 --> 38:19.568
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'VE BEEN THROUGH RECENTLY.

38:19.568 --> 38:21.900
AND MAYBE I WAS...

38:21.900 --> 38:24.533
TRYING TO FORGET THAT
WITH YOU?

38:24.533 --> 38:27.376
BUT I AM NOT ATTRACTED
TO WOMEN.

38:27.376 --> 38:30.809
SO NO MATTER WHAT IT WAS,

38:30.809 --> 38:32.711
IT DOESN'T COUNT.

38:35.644 --> 38:38.747
WELL...

38:38.747 --> 38:42.090
I KNOW HOW YOU TOUCHED ME,

38:42.090 --> 38:43.952
AND I...

38:43.952 --> 38:48.096
I SAW THE LOOK IN YOUR EYES
WHEN I TOUCHED YOU.

38:48.096 --> 38:49.658
YOU MAY DENY IT NOW,

38:49.658 --> 38:52.631
BUT WE CONNECTED...

38:52.631 --> 38:54.363
AND IT COUNTED.

39:07.516 --> 39:10.549
OKAY.

39:12.651 --> 39:14.883
IT COUNTED.

39:14.883 --> 39:18.957
THANK YOU.

39:27.365 --> 39:30.138
HEY, YOU WANT AN EXTRA PILLOW?

39:32.040 --> 39:35.544
THERE'S EMPTY SEATS
IN THE BACK.

39:35.544 --> 39:38.376
I'M JUST GONNA
GO SLEEP THERE.

39:41.750 --> 39:43.912
AHEM. YOU OKAY?

39:43.912 --> 39:46.955
YEAH. I'M JUST TIRED.

39:50.058 --> 39:53.061
WELL, YOU MAY HAVE PICKED UP
ON THIS TRIP

39:53.061 --> 39:55.864
THAT I HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN
A GOOD PERSON.

39:55.864 --> 39:58.066
AND I'M GONNA WORK ON THAT,

39:58.066 --> 39:59.928
STARTING WITH YOU.

39:59.928 --> 40:03.101
OH. DID DANNY SAY THERE WERE
SEATS IN THE BACK?

40:03.101 --> 40:06.034
NO, NO, NO. COME ON. COME ON.
I'M SERIOUS. I'M SERIOUS.

40:06.034 --> 40:08.036
LOOK,
I KNOW YOU HAVE A SECRET.

40:10.679 --> 40:13.542
CARLOS AND I OVERHEARD
YOU AND NICK FIGHTING...

40:13.542 --> 40:15.744
(whispers) SOMETHING ABOUT
BLOWING YOUR COVER.

40:15.744 --> 40:19.488
(normal voice) DON'T WORRY.
I DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY. I JUST...

40:19.488 --> 40:22.891
I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT...

40:22.891 --> 40:26.755
I'VE CARRIED AROUND
A LOT OF SECRETS,

40:26.755 --> 40:29.157
AND I KNOW HOW LONELY
IT CAN FEEL.

40:31.500 --> 40:33.802
SO IF YOU EVER NEED
A FRIEND...

40:43.011 --> 40:44.773
(sighs deeply)

40:44.773 --> 40:46.475
OKAY.

40:49.217 --> 40:52.581
WHEN I WAS 18,
I WANTED TO SAVE THE PLANET.

40:52.581 --> 40:54.623
I ORGANIZED PROTESTS

40:54.623 --> 40:59.628
AGAINST LOGGING COMPANIES,
BIG OIL, AUTO PLANTS.

40:59.628 --> 41:02.961
BUT THEN I GOT INVOLVED
WITH A BAD GUY...

41:02.961 --> 41:05.093
A REALLY BAD GUY.

41:05.093 --> 41:08.737
HE CONVINCED ME THAT WE HAD
TO GET MORE AGGRESSIVE.

41:11.139 --> 41:13.542
LONG STORY SHORT...

41:15.674 --> 41:17.646
SOMEONE GOT KILLED.

41:22.010 --> 41:25.213
SO... THIS BAD GUY--

41:25.213 --> 41:27.956
YOU'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT NICK, ARE YOU?

41:27.956 --> 41:31.620
NO. HE'S THE ONE WHO HELPED ME
RUN AWAY FROM THE PSYCHO.

41:34.563 --> 41:36.094
SO WHO'S THE PSYCHO?

41:39.167 --> 41:42.030
DANNY'S FATHER.

41:45.604 --> 41:50.008
IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY
TO SEE SOMEONE'S TRUE COLORS.

41:50.008 --> 41:55.884
SOMETIMES YOU MUST LOOK BENEATH
THE MASCULINE VENEER

41:55.884 --> 41:59.688
TO FIND THAT FRAGILE EGO.

41:59.688 --> 42:04.823
YOU MUST IGNORE
THE SPARKLE OF THE JEWEL

42:04.823 --> 42:08.897
TO KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING
AT A FAKE.

42:08.897 --> 42:14.232
YOU MUST BRING THE TRUTH
OUT OF THE SHADOWS

42:14.232 --> 42:18.637
TO SEE THE BEAUTY OF ITS SMILE.

42:18.637 --> 42:23.141
YES, PEOPLE HIDE THEIR
TRUE NATURE FROM US EVERY DAY,

42:23.141 --> 42:28.817
AND SADLY, WE ONLY FIND OUT
WHEN IT'S TOO LATE.

42:28.817 --> 42:32.921
UH, MR. LOGAN?
IT'S IRIS BECKLEY.

42:32.921 --> 42:35.884
OH, I LIVE, UH,
NEXT TO ROSE DE LUCA.

42:35.884 --> 42:38.587
Y-YOU TOLD ME, UH,
TO GIVE YOU A RING

42:38.587 --> 42:40.729
IF I EVER SAW ROSE'S DAUGHTER.

42:40.729 --> 42:42.731
(chuckles) NO. NO, NO, NO.

42:42.731 --> 42:45.093
NO, I'LL--I'LL TELL YOU
WHERE SHE LIVES

42:45.093 --> 42:47.636
WHEN I GET MY $1,000.
