- Crushes.

I know it crushes, but do you like it?
Do you play it when you're not onstage?

31:29.120 --> 31:32.647
- I don't see your point.
- My point is, if you don't like it, why pick it?

31:32.800 --> 31:34.450
I didn't pick it. Dallas did.

31:34.600 --> 31:37.410
Exactly. You didn't pick it,
so it's not on the inside.

of your own routines...

"Pony," that wasn't a dance routine.

look like he was hitting that shit right.

was imagine what I would do to her.

- It's hard to get people to pay attention.

that comes on the Internet every day.

but I was playing Mickey by my second year.

But now, if the E.P. blew up tomorrow...

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:09.487

in their lives every day who...
