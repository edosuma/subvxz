- I didn't do it.

00:15.850 --> 00:20.021
- Mr. Steadman, it's contraband.
- I brought it to protect myself.

00:20.188 --> 00:21.606
That's what we're here for.

00:28.279 --> 00:30.281
It's Pam. What's going on?

00:30.448 --> 00:33.451
I love you. Give Cam
a kiss for me, okay?

00:33.993 --> 00:35.995
You call this number again,
you're a dead man.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.163
You want my help.

00:37.330 --> 00:38.915
- I want my job back.
- What's your plan?

00:39.081 --> 00:41.792
When those brothers get in the van,
be the last thing they ever do.

01:45.147 --> 01:47.316
I want a team flanking the west.

02:11.716 --> 02:13.634

02:15.219 --> 02:18.431
I'm looking for Alexander Mahone.
I'm his direct supervisor.

02:18.597 --> 02:22.476
I'm sorry to tell you this, sir,
but your boy's been shot.

02:29.900 --> 02:30.985
Who are you?

02:31.152 --> 02:32.737
I used to work for the president.

02:33.321 --> 02:34.530
Why are you helping us?

02:36.115 --> 02:38.576
Lay down on the floor. Now.

02:58.429 --> 02:59.930
Federal agent. Let me through.

03:00.806 --> 03:05.227
Air support is telling us that they saw
your vehicle traveling down Route 46.

03:05.394 --> 03:09.607
Forty-six is a possible exit route
for the convicts. I was securing it.

03:09.774 --> 03:12.651
No offense, sir,
but we're searching every vehicle.

03:12.818 --> 03:15.821
No offense. Either you let me through
or you get me a supervisor.

03:15.988 --> 03:18.199
I'm supervising this roadblock,
Agent Kellerman.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.077

to get out of the vehicle.

03:25.164 --> 03:27.833
Burrows and Scofield
have been loose for less than 10 minutes.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.212
That means every second is critical.
So if you detain me...

03:31.379 --> 03:34.298
...for one moment more,
I will have all of yourjobs.

03:34.465 --> 03:36.008

- What?

03:40.596 --> 03:41.972
MAN:
Just let him go.

You still haven't answered my question.

04:05.079 --> 04:06.622
KELLERMAN:
Why am I helping you?

04:06.914 --> 04:09.917
Because the enemy
of my enemy is my friend.

04:10.751 --> 04:14.296
You said something about taking down
the president. I assume you have a plan.

04:14.713 --> 04:16.214
I do.

04:16.423 --> 04:19.677
I used to have a Great Dane.
We had to put her down.

04:19.844 --> 04:21.095
It was very peaceful.

04:21.262 --> 04:24.640
Shh. One minute she
was breathing, the next she wasn't.

04:29.270 --> 04:30.354
Turn around.

04:48.247 --> 04:49.790
Get up.

04:52.251 --> 04:54.795
Give me one reason why
I shouldn't blow your brains out.

04:54.962 --> 04:58.257
KELLERMAN: Because I can give you
the one thing that's gonna set you free.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.259
I know where Terrence Steadman is.

05:42.051 --> 05:43.969
How do you know
where Steadman is?

05:44.136 --> 05:45.971
Because I arranged this whole thing.

05:46.138 --> 05:47.765
- You arranged to set me up?
- Right.

05:47.932 --> 05:50.601
You arranged the killing
of all the people I know.

05:50.768 --> 05:53.020
I was given orders.
I executed those orders.

05:53.187 --> 05:56.106
And now I have a bull's-eye
on my chest, just like you two.

05:57.358 --> 05:59.485
- I don't trust him.
- Hey.

06:03.447 --> 06:06.867
If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.

06:07.743 --> 06:09.870
You guys want to keep running, fine.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.623
You wanna be free, get in the car.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.452
Looks like you're having
a tough time of it.

06:51.412 --> 06:53.998
- I'm all right.
- Well, I'm just curious.

06:55.165 --> 06:58.752
Why don't you hang out with the rest
of the ex-guards who are locked up here?

07:00.129 --> 07:01.839
Oh, yeah.

beneficial arrangement in my mind.

I'll look out after you.
Make sure nobody get up in your mix.

07:20.899 --> 07:24.403
And all you got to do is bring me
your dessert after the next meal.

It's real simple.

I don't want any trouble.

for my indiscretions...
