wasn't her intention

He's right outside,

26:30.389 --> 26:33.760

considered the possibility.

has to show up

for all concerned

assign somebody else

30:54.620 --> 30:55.955
Did you talk to her about it?

with the prison pharmacy

52:44.895 --> 52:45.896
Well, look at you.

52:46.764 --> 52:47.865
You wanna kill me, don't ya?

52:48.333 --> 52:49.534
Go for it.

52:49.767 --> 52:51.769
I'm a fucking cop.
See what happens.

52:52.970 --> 52:54.272
That's right.

52:54.672 --> 52:56.674
Now get your
fucking hand off of me.

53:01.412 --> 53:02.847
(LAUGHING)

53:04.649 --> 53:06.917
Fucking Kelly.
You crack me up.

53:08.553 --> 53:09.654
Here's what I think.

53:12.390 --> 53:13.424
(GRUNTS)

53:14.392 --> 53:17.228
If you ever even think
of laying a hand on me,

53:17.762 --> 53:19.530
it'll be the last thought
you ever have.

53:24.269 --> 53:25.270
I'll be in touch.

53:26.003 --> 53:28.373
Now, come on,
clean this place up.

53:28.406 --> 53:29.674
You open up in a week.

53:33.878 --> 53:35.613
Oh, and by the way,

53:36.947 --> 53:37.982
Tommy's dead, man.

53:38.883 --> 53:40.217
He's long gone.

53:41.286 --> 53:43.854
Welcome to the land of fuck.

53:46.957 --> 53:48.959
(WHISTLING)
