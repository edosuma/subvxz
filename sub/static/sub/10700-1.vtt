22:32.554 --> 22:34.156
Don't answer it.

22:34.756 --> 22:36.257
I haven't called her all week.

22:36.259 --> 22:39.993
She sucks you dry, Mia. Let
her drown in her own shit.

22:39.995 --> 22:41.962
The new meds make her feel funny.

22:44.800 --> 22:47.102
She's funny already, though, isn't she?

23:00.616 --> 23:01.915
You have to eat something.

23:01.917 --> 23:03.519
What are you, his fucking mother?

23:04.253 --> 23:05.654
Fuck off, Jake.

23:07.055 --> 23:11.193
I've been thinking... Happy
birthday, little brother.

23:13.029 --> 23:16.099
Here you go. It's your size. Try it on.

23:17.600 --> 23:18.999
Did you get it?

23:19.001 --> 23:21.702
I didn't know it. Jake didn't tell me.

23:21.704 --> 23:22.636
What? He got it?

23:22.638 --> 23:23.803
I didn't know.

23:23.805 --> 23:25.172
I went into your room to check your size.

23:25.174 --> 23:26.773
You know, all that shabby shit you wear...

23:26.775 --> 23:27.974
There you go, now you can try something

23:27.976 --> 23:30.877
that doesn't make you look like a dickhead.

23:30.879 --> 23:31.979
You got it?

23:31.981 --> 23:33.047
Go take the other shirt off,

23:33.049 --> 23:35.185
you can't see it like that, you twat.

23:36.051 --> 23:37.853
Come here.

23:40.590 --> 23:42.356
See? It looks nice.

23:42.358 --> 23:44.191
I can't wear it to school, can I?

23:44.193 --> 23:47.194
Take it off, wear it later. I don't know.

23:47.196 --> 23:48.828
Try to get yourself a
boyfriend or something.

23:48.830 --> 23:50.230
<i>Fuck off!</i>

23:50.232 --> 23:53.867
What are you doing later?
I'll take you out for a drink.

23:53.869 --> 23:55.338
What?

23:56.272 --> 23:58.705
You only want to be seen
with your chavvy mates?

23:58.707 --> 24:00.075
No. Okay, I'll come.

24:00.408 --> 24:02.044
Good.

24:02.844 --> 24:04.279
16!

24:07.049 --> 24:08.318
Huh?

24:14.756 --> 24:16.290
You know, you can sign
off your own place now

24:16.292 --> 24:17.560
and get a flat yourself.

24:18.026 --> 24:20.194
- Jesus.
- What?

24:20.196 --> 24:21.228
You've got a house, haven't you?

24:21.230 --> 24:22.195
If you're homeless.

24:22.197 --> 24:25.432
- Shut up, Jake!
- I'm not homeless, though.

24:25.434 --> 24:27.033
Unless you are.

24:27.035 --> 24:28.969
This place is in Dad's name, remember?

24:28.971 --> 24:30.404
And I pay the rent, remember?

24:30.406 --> 24:32.039
Oh, yeah? Well, big man you are,

24:32.041 --> 24:34.074
with your fucking shitty job selling TVs.

24:34.076 --> 24:36.512
- You little cunt.
- Jake!

24:39.682 --> 24:42.485
And don't you fucking come back!

24:50.693 --> 24:54.461
<i>Fin! Fin, I didn't
know it was your birthday.</i>

24:54.463 --> 24:56.664
You know, Jake's right.

24:56.666 --> 24:58.732
Just who the fuck do you think you are?

24:58.734 --> 25:01.167
Why are you apologizing
for not knowing my birthday?

25:01.169 --> 25:03.338
You're nothing to me. Nothing!

25:07.275 --> 25:10.412
For fuck's sake, Finley!
Just go before he sees.

25:17.852 --> 25:20.921
Right on the crotch. You're
not doing it properly.

25:24.060 --> 25:26.793
Oh, fuck! Don't land on me.

25:26.795 --> 25:28.297
Jesus.

25:33.234 --> 25:35.269
Her last name is Lees.
Her surname name was Lees.

25:35.271 --> 25:37.003
Oh, mate, that was ridiculous.

25:37.005 --> 25:38.739
- Hey.
- Nice bike.

25:38.741 --> 25:40.710
- That's mine.
- Come on, get off of it.

25:41.877 --> 25:44.310
- That's mine.
- Get off!

25:44.312 --> 25:45.480
You cunt!

25:59.195 --> 26:01.531
Fuckin'... Ah, nice one!

26:02.164 --> 26:05.201
Souvenir. Souvenir.

26:05.935 --> 26:06.899
We're done.

26:06.901 --> 26:08.234
Fuckin' terr... Ow!

26:08.236 --> 26:09.970
Ow!

26:09.972 --> 26:11.972
Bastard!

26:11.974 --> 26:14.174
Fuckin' hell, man! Fuckin' hell!

26:14.176 --> 26:15.274
Fuckin' hell!

26:15.276 --> 26:16.309
You gotta put them near me.

26:16.311 --> 26:18.479
- What? How am I doin' it?
- Put them fuckin' there!

26:18.481 --> 26:20.748
I was puttin' them... Ow!
I was putting them there.

26:20.750 --> 26:22.281
You put 'em there!

26:22.283 --> 26:24.318
All right. Let's...

26:27.990 --> 26:29.790
- Oi, prick!
- All right, go on, then.

26:29.792 --> 26:30.824
Otherwise, we're going home.

26:30.826 --> 26:32.158
All right! How do we do it? Go on!

26:32.160 --> 26:34.429
All right, hold them fucking still.

26:35.196 --> 26:35.995
What the fuck!

26:35.997 --> 26:37.196
You can't do that! That's cheating!

26:37.198 --> 26:38.264
Ow!

26:38.266 --> 26:39.465
What? Just let you hit me?

26:39.467 --> 26:40.567
Ow!

26:40.569 --> 26:42.538
Go, then.

26:43.438 --> 26:45.539
Fuckin' hell, man!

26:45.541 --> 26:46.773
Go on, then.

26:46.775 --> 26:48.008
Fuckin'...

26:48.010 --> 26:50.543
Stop slapping me!

26:50.545 --> 26:51.811
Ooh!

26:51.813 --> 26:53.513
All right, Fin. Fucking hell, bruv.

26:53.515 --> 26:54.548
Look, look...

26:54.550 --> 26:56.116
Put your hands there, you pussy...

26:56.118 --> 26:58.886
This... this isn't even
how you play it, mate.

26:58.888 --> 27:00.319
You can't do it with two!

27:00.321 --> 27:01.989
You were goin' like that!

27:01.991 --> 27:03.991
You're not supposed to go like that!

27:03.993 --> 27:05.561
Do it proper.

27:09.932 --> 27:11.964
It's a big fuck-off elephant in the room.

27:11.966 --> 27:14.934
She's bang tighty and
your brother's a cunt.

27:14.936 --> 27:16.270
How'd you live with it?

27:16.272 --> 27:18.038
I don't fancy her.

27:18.040 --> 27:18.938
Yeah.

27:18.940 --> 27:20.240
Well, she's with him, isn't she?

27:20.242 --> 27:22.142
She's a fucking idiot.

27:22.144 --> 27:25.078
You could always, you know...

27:25.080 --> 27:26.613
be the shoulder to lean on.

27:26.615 --> 27:29.015
Next time he's a cunt to her...

27:29.017 --> 27:32.185
welcome her with open
arms, and then, you know...

27:32.187 --> 27:33.319
...slip it in.

27:33.321 --> 27:35.521
- I'm not interested, mate.
- Yeah?

27:35.523 --> 27:38.125
Your brother would cave your
fucking head in, as well.

27:38.127 --> 27:40.228
What the fuck?

27:41.163 --> 27:43.199
♪♪

29:43.584 --> 29:46.221
What's the inspiration, Tindall?

29:49.023 --> 29:52.059
Inspiration is an abstract noun.

29:52.061 --> 29:53.527
A noun that expresses something

29:53.529 --> 29:55.598
that you can't hold in your hands.

29:58.367 --> 30:00.503
Do you understand, Tindall?

30:01.503 --> 30:06.306
No, wait. Let's... Let's backtrack.

30:06.308 --> 30:09.142
I'm not even sure you know what a noun is.

30:09.144 --> 30:10.309
Do you, Tindall?

30:10.311 --> 30:12.311
Do you know what a noun is?

30:12.313 --> 30:14.749
<i>Cat. Dog.</i>

30:18.353 --> 30:19.854
Hammer.

30:21.657 --> 30:23.391
Nail.

30:27.495 --> 30:29.431
Nail gun.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.802
Object.

30:37.805 --> 30:39.708
Do you understand, Tindall?

30:41.577 --> 30:45.444
Now, an abstract noun...

30:45.446 --> 30:47.513
has no physical existence.

30:47.515 --> 30:50.450
It can only be thought or felt.

30:50.452 --> 30:51.821
Like love.

30:52.053 --> 30:53.153
Hatred.

30:53.155 --> 30:55.858
Happiness. Sadness.

30:57.225 --> 30:58.427
<i>Freedom.</i>

30:59.561 --> 31:00.830
<i>Courage.</i>

31:01.096 --> 31:02.261
Hope.

31:02.263 --> 31:03.698
Despair.

31:04.332 --> 31:05.601
Justice.

31:06.135 --> 31:07.370
Fear.

31:10.406 --> 31:11.974
Do you understand, Tindall?

31:14.376 --> 31:16.108
Excellent.

31:16.110 --> 31:17.511
Now...

31:17.513 --> 31:20.483
What does inspiration mean?

31:25.420 --> 31:27.287
Ten seconds, Tindall.

31:27.289 --> 31:30.293
Until I nail your right hand to the desk.

31:33.361 --> 31:34.627
Inspiration.

31:34.629 --> 31:40.133
I-N-S-P-I-R-A-T-I-O-N.
Inspiration.

31:40.135 --> 31:42.501
Ten seconds, until, as I say,

31:42.503 --> 31:45.371
I nail your right hand to the desk.

31:45.373 --> 31:50.676
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

31:50.678 --> 31:55.717
<i>five, four, three, two...</i>

31:56.452 --> 31:58.387
<i>Good, Tindall.</i>

31:59.221 --> 32:00.423
<i>Well done.</i>

32:01.557 --> 32:07.126
Now, I'm going to remove the
tape from your mouth, okay?

32:07.128 --> 32:09.495
<i>If you shout out or scream,</i>

32:09.497 --> 32:11.231
I shall hit you in the head again

32:11.233 --> 32:15.670
with this iron, adjective,
hammer, noun. Is that clear?

32:16.905 --> 32:20.443
Excellent. I'm so glad.

32:29.818 --> 32:32.021
Read the definition.

32:34.455 --> 32:39.495
"The pro... process of being mentally..."

32:41.163 --> 32:42.729
Stimulated.

32:42.731 --> 32:45.699

32:45.701 --> 32:48.467
"Especially, to do something creative,

32:48.469 --> 32:50.436
i.e. flashes of inspiration."

32:50.438 --> 32:51.871
Good! Good.

32:51.873 --> 32:53.607
Now, look up "motivation".

32:53.609 --> 32:57.144
<i>M-O-T-I-V-A-T-I-O-N.</i>

32:57.146 --> 32:58.613
Ten seconds, Tindall.

32:59.414 --> 33:02.781
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

33:02.783 --> 33:07.686
six, five, four, three...

33:07.688 --> 33:11.625
Good, Tindall. You're doing so well.

33:11.627 --> 33:12.928
Proceed.

33:14.929 --> 33:17.466
<i>Read the definition.</i>

33:20.202 --> 33:25.371
"Motivation, the process that in...

33:25.373 --> 33:28.340

33:32.246 --> 33:33.646
Precisely.

33:33.648 --> 33:35.615
Initiating, guiding,

33:35.617 --> 33:38.987

33:40.522 --> 33:42.722
Look up "idealism".

34:01.944 --> 34:04.780

Fast, Tindall.

34:06.982 --> 34:09.117
Motivation. See?

34:09.551 --> 34:10.784
Read it out.

34:13.522 --> 34:17.559
"The beliefs that your

34:18.759 --> 34:21.831

34:22.831 --> 34:24.699
Wonderful.

34:25.534 --> 34:27.101
Your ideals being...

34:28.002 --> 34:30.337
your aspirations towards
something innocent,

34:30.339 --> 34:31.904
something pure.

34:31.906 --> 34:34.574
Your idealism being the
belief that it can be achieved,

34:34.576 --> 34:38.478
even if it does not seem likely to others.

34:38.480 --> 34:40.913
Exactly how I must have
appeared to my older colleagues

34:40.915 --> 34:43.818
when I first started teaching 20 years ago.

34:45.253 --> 34:50.489
What a wonderfully empathic
description of the word. Hmm?

34:50.491 --> 34:56.061
"Empathic," adjective,
descriptive word of empathy.

34:56.063 --> 34:57.867
Abstract noun.

34:58.433 --> 35:00.266
Look up "empathy", Tindall.

35:00.268 --> 35:04.003
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

35:04.005 --> 35:08.474
six, five, four...

35:08.476 --> 35:11.813
Good! Read it out.

35:12.614 --> 35:19.518
"The power of understanding and ima..."

35:19.520 --> 35:21.454
Imaginatively.

35:21.456 --> 35:25.625
"...imaginatively entering
into another person's feelings."

35:25.627 --> 35:26.893
<i>In other words,</i>

35:26.895 --> 35:28.930
<i>putting yourself in
someone else's shoes.</i>

35:32.500 --> 35:33.900
Ta-da!

35:41.976 --> 35:44.710
So, a classroom of empathic,

35:44.712 --> 35:46.746
adjective, descriptive word, children,

35:46.748 --> 35:48.480
would have some ability to put themselves

35:48.482 --> 35:49.617
in their teacher's shoes.

35:50.485 --> 35:52.351
To imagine how it must feel for him or her

35:52.353 --> 35:55.587
to face a bunch of sneering, hostile,

35:55.589 --> 35:57.123
and apparently soulless adolescents,

35:57.125 --> 36:00.025
day after day for 20 years.

36:00.027 --> 36:03.362
To attempt to spark some flicker of...

36:03.364 --> 36:05.532
...inspiration...

36:05.534 --> 36:08.567
through some of the greatest
writers ever known...

36:08.569 --> 36:10.737
and to witness the relentless tide

36:10.739 --> 36:12.706
of the worst in human behaviors,

36:12.708 --> 36:18.143
ranging from indifference
to animalistic aggression...

36:18.145 --> 36:19.579
to physical abuse.

36:26.487 --> 36:28.823
I was an idealist once.

36:32.493 --> 36:35.763
I believed inspiration
was the key to learning.

36:36.630 --> 36:38.965
I had empathy for my students.

36:38.967 --> 36:41.067
For the shortcomings of their upbringings.

36:41.069 --> 36:42.969
For the miserable blankness

36:42.971 --> 36:45.538
of their emotionally, intellectually,

36:45.540 --> 36:48.074
and materially deprived circumstances.

36:48.076 --> 36:50.543
20 years ago...

36:50.545 --> 36:54.783
You see, I thought...

36:55.650 --> 36:57.449
I thought if they'd encounter humanity,

36:57.451 --> 37:00.387
they'd respond with humanity.

37:00.389 --> 37:01.855
Do you know what Charles Lamb said?

37:01.857 --> 37:05.791
He said, "Let us live the
beauty of our own reality."

37:05.793 --> 37:07.694
Do you know what he said to Wordsworth?

37:07.696 --> 37:12.831
He said, "Have I not enough
without your mountains?"

37:12.833 --> 37:16.770
He was talking about the
beauty he found in the ordinary.

37:16.772 --> 37:18.438
In the streets of London.

37:18.440 --> 37:21.007

So, Rousseau's interest
was in human perception.

43:36.150 --> 43:39.018
Imagination became God.

43:39.020 --> 43:41.853
He believed man was
innocent and naturally good.

43:41.855 --> 43:46.525
He said, "Man is born free,
but everywhere he's in chains."

43:46.527 --> 43:50.529
He wrote the first treatise
on child-centered education.

43:52.065 --> 43:53.800
Yet, curiously enough,

43:53.802 --> 43:56.302
delivered all his children into orphanages.

43:58.172 --> 44:00.540
That, dear Tindall, is irony.

44:01.942 --> 44:03.509

"Man is born free, but

What is society?

44:22.230 --> 44:24.931
We fall from grace...

But how? Why?

44:28.603 --> 44:30.469
The biblical metaphor, Adam and Eve,

44:30.471 --> 44:33.505
made into an epic celebration of man's fall

44:33.507 --> 44:35.543
<i>in Milton's "Paradise Lost",</i>

44:36.511 --> 44:38.878
explains it as an
inevitable flaw in God's plan

44:41.616 --> 44:46.918

44:46.920 --> 44:50.590
Do you know what Blake
said about Milton? Hmm?

The interesting about "Animal Farm" is

59:05.946 --> 59:07.145
at the end of the novel,

59:07.147 --> 59:08.512
the animals can't tell
the difference between

the original human
oppressors, the aristocracy,

59:10.984 --> 59:13.418

whereas the film,

59:15.755 --> 59:16.987
ends with the animals simply overthrowing

hardship, injustice, suffering?

since you let your
education slip off your skin.

01:10:50.016 --> 01:10:52.183
As easily as you allowed your makeup

01:10:52.185 --> 01:10:55.287
to slip onto other boys' shirts, I'm sure.

01:10:56.889 --> 01:11:00.259
Let's see, if you can
learn something now, hmm?

01:11:02.861 --> 01:11:04.060
<i>Now, where was I?</i>

01:11:04.062 --> 01:11:05.865
Jack!

01:11:06.432 --> 01:11:08.966
Jack represents human beings

01:11:08.968 --> 01:11:12.869
without the enforceable
laws of civilization.

01:11:12.871 --> 01:11:18.141
Lawlessness, savagery, and
a thirst to control others.

01:11:18.143 --> 01:11:21.281
Jack represents Leviathan.

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:24.482
Hobbes' natural state of man.

01:11:24.484 --> 01:11:25.683
But Roger...

01:11:25.685 --> 01:11:28.519
Now, remember this...
Roger's often overlooked.

01:11:28.521 --> 01:11:31.122
Roger is the group's natural sadist.

01:11:31.124 --> 01:11:34.759
He is the one free from the
controls of normal society,

01:11:34.761 --> 01:11:38.261
best able to fulfill
his potential as bully,

01:11:38.263 --> 01:11:40.366
torturer, killer.

01:11:43.803 --> 01:11:46.237
I'd say you were a Roger, Whitely,

01:11:46.239 --> 01:11:47.607
if the tables were turned.

01:11:48.975 --> 01:11:52.275
And here we come to the
most important abstract noun

01:11:52.277 --> 01:11:53.810
in literature,

01:11:53.812 --> 01:11:55.247
perhaps, in life.

01:11:55.781 --> 01:11:57.017
Irony.

01:12:03.789 --> 01:12:05.891
Read it!

01:12:07.593 --> 01:12:08.759
Read it.

01:12:08.761 --> 01:12:10.994
I found the place in
the dictionary for you.

01:12:10.996 --> 01:12:13.730
Now, fucking read it, Whitely!

01:12:13.732 --> 01:12:16.833
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

01:12:23.610 --> 01:12:25.275
Irony.

01:12:25.277 --> 01:12:28.912
"An expression or situation
marked by deliberate contrast

01:12:28.914 --> 01:12:31.517
between apparent and intended meaning."

01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:37.189
Meat... meat with thumbs!

01:12:41.794 --> 01:12:43.196
Oh, God.

01:12:43.596 --> 01:12:44.798
No!

01:12:52.838 --> 01:12:54.540
No!

01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:37.280
If you scream, I'll
kill you. Is that clear?

01:13:49.963 --> 01:13:52.930
The fact that I appear to be torturing you,

01:13:52.932 --> 01:13:56.801
and yet, I accuse Whitely
of being a sadist...

01:13:56.803 --> 01:14:00.304
could be construed as irony.

01:14:08.047 --> 01:14:10.183
And let me tell you something.

01:14:21.761 --> 01:14:23.630
I'm not a natural sadist.

01:14:26.699 --> 01:14:29.033
I could spot the sadists.

01:14:29.035 --> 01:14:31.438
The special look they had.

01:14:32.004 --> 01:14:34.039
The void.

01:14:34.272 --> 01:14:35.575
Blank.

01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:38.011
Empty.

01:14:43.081 --> 01:14:45.882
I've got over 50,000 pounds worth

01:14:45.884 --> 01:14:48.220
of first editions at home.

01:14:49.222 --> 01:14:50.523
I'd give them all...

01:14:51.124 --> 01:14:52.492
all of them...

01:14:53.459 --> 01:14:56.226
just to see one child

01:14:56.228 --> 01:15:01.267
with an open mind and
open heart be inspired.

01:15:05.405 --> 01:15:07.470
The irony in "Lord of the Flies"

01:15:07.472 --> 01:15:08.506
stems from the fact...

01:15:09.409 --> 01:15:11.942
that the boys escape the terrible

01:15:11.944 --> 01:15:16.747
and yet seemingly righteous war
that the adults are waging...

01:15:16.749 --> 01:15:20.951
and find themselves in a beautiful place.

01:15:20.953 --> 01:15:24.020
But their basic natures end up taking over,

01:15:24.022 --> 01:15:26.558
and they end up at war.

01:15:31.164 --> 01:15:32.829
Do you know what William Golding's

01:15:32.831 --> 01:15:35.235
profession was, Tindall?

01:15:37.303 --> 01:15:38.571
Can you guess?

01:15:43.843 --> 01:15:46.246
He was a school teacher.

01:15:56.222 --> 01:15:57.524
Right.

01:16:02.728 --> 01:16:04.397
It's time for a test.

01:16:08.366 --> 01:16:10.835
I'm afraid this is mostly for you, Tindall,

01:16:10.837 --> 01:16:14.204
as Whitely here is
incapacitated, and, um...

01:16:14.206 --> 01:16:17.344
Mmm. I know it's a foreign name.

01:16:18.276 --> 01:16:20.043
Vukovic!

01:16:20.045 --> 01:16:21.878
Vukovic here has missed
a chunk of the class

01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:23.983
through no fault of her own.

01:16:25.284 --> 01:16:27.952
Are you ready? Good!

01:16:27.954 --> 01:16:29.987
- What's a noun?
- Ob... ob... object.

01:16:29.989 --> 01:16:31.055
Excellent.

01:16:31.057 --> 01:16:35.158
What's an abstract noun?
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:37.260
Have a feel... thinking something.

01:16:37.262 --> 01:16:40.463
Not quite. Five, four...

01:16:40.465 --> 01:16:42.933
Feelings, ideas, concepts.

01:16:42.935 --> 01:16:45.536
Roughly, yes, roughly.

01:16:45.538 --> 01:16:47.137
Next, define an ideal.

01:16:47.139 --> 01:16:50.006
Third nail, Tindall. Now, remember...

01:16:50.008 --> 01:16:51.710
Ten, nine, eight...

01:16:52.344 --> 01:16:54.912
Something... something perfect.

01:16:54.914 --> 01:16:56.383
No, not really.

01:16:57.850 --> 01:17:01.118
Something seems perfect,
something to look up to.

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:02.153
Will do.

01:17:02.155 --> 01:17:04.121
What's idealism?

01:17:04.123 --> 01:17:06.055
Uh, believing you can
get the perfect thing,

01:17:06.057 --> 01:17:08.024
even when others don't think you can.

01:17:08.026 --> 01:17:09.326
Empathy?

01:17:09.328 --> 01:17:12.195
Putting yourself in someone else's shoes.

01:17:12.197 --> 01:17:13.096
Allegory?

01:17:13.098 --> 01:17:17.967
A story... a story with a hidden meaning.

01:17:17.969 --> 01:17:19.403
Totalitarianism?

01:17:19.405 --> 01:17:22.105
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

01:17:22.107 --> 01:17:25.943
six, five, four, three, two, one...

01:17:25.945 --> 01:17:28.148
I don't fucking know!

01:17:28.947 --> 01:17:30.784
I don't know!

01:17:59.846 --> 01:18:01.113
"O, Rose, thou art sick."

01:18:02.013 --> 01:18:03.546
"The invisible worm,
that flies in the night

01:18:03.548 --> 01:18:04.915
"through the howling storm

01:18:04.917 --> 01:18:07.117
"has found out thy bed of crimson joy.

01:18:07.119 --> 01:18:11.622
And his dark secret love
does thy life destroy."

01:18:11.624 --> 01:18:13.023
Totalitarianism.

01:18:13.025 --> 01:18:14.058
Ten seconds, Tindall,

01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:15.859
before I put this nail in her head.

01:18:15.861 --> 01:18:18.929
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

01:18:18.931 --> 01:18:23.100
One person having total control,
running everyone. Dictator!

01:18:23.102 --> 01:18:24.137
Archetype?

01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:27.438
Symbolic of a type, a
kind of person or thing.

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.439
What did Thomas Hobbes say
about the life of a man?

01:18:29.441 --> 01:18:31.408
"Nasty, brutish, and short."

01:18:31.410 --> 01:18:34.211
Who wrote the first treatise
in child-centered education?

01:18:34.213 --> 01:18:35.645
Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

01:18:35.647 --> 01:18:38.248
"In every cry of every man,
in every infant's cry of fear,

01:18:38.250 --> 01:18:39.416
in every voice: in every ban..."

01:18:39.418 --> 01:18:40.885
"The mind-forg'd manacles I hear."

01:18:40.887 --> 01:18:42.086
William Blake, London,

01:18:42.088 --> 01:18:43.554
<i>"Songs of Innocence and Experience,"</i>

01:18:43.556 --> 01:18:45.291
circa 1794.

01:18:46.157 --> 01:18:47.625
The chart'd streets and the chart'd Thames

01:18:47.627 --> 01:18:49.059
refer to what, what does it mean?

01:18:49.061 --> 01:18:51.996
<i>Everything that was
divided up by the rich.</i>

01:18:51.998 --> 01:18:54.465
- Who wrote "Hard Times"?
- Dickens!

01:18:54.467 --> 01:18:56.500
- "Leviathan"?
- Hobbes! Thomas Hobbes!

01:18:56.502 --> 01:18:57.635
Who wrote to Wordsworth,

01:18:57.637 --> 01:18:59.269
"Have I not enough without your mountains?"

01:18:59.271 --> 01:19:00.104
Charles Lamb.

01:19:00.106 --> 01:19:02.907
- Who wrote "Paradise Lost"?
- Milton.

01:19:02.909 --> 01:19:04.241
What did William Blake say about Milton?

01:19:04.243 --> 01:19:06.443
That... that he was a
poet of the devil's side

01:19:06.445 --> 01:19:07.644
but didn't know it!

01:19:14.419 --> 01:19:17.988
Tindall, you're... you're a fucking genius!

01:19:24.396 --> 01:19:27.096
Milton sublimated his own rage
and passion without realizing it

01:19:27.098 --> 01:19:28.532
in his the depiction of the devil.

01:19:28.534 --> 01:19:30.234
Who did Charlotte Brontë
sublimate Jane Eyre's

01:19:30.236 --> 01:19:32.403
- ...passion into?
- Wordsworth.

01:19:35.074 --> 01:19:36.640
You obviously did not
understand the question.

01:19:36.642 --> 01:19:39.342
Jane Eyre learns to repress
her feelings at an early age.

01:19:39.344 --> 01:19:41.478
But Charlotte Bronte finds an outlet

01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:43.514
for the expression of female
rage and passion where?

01:19:43.516 --> 01:19:45.482
<i>I don't know! Please, stop!</i>

01:19:45.484 --> 01:19:48.985
You know it! You
know it! Ten, nine, eight...

01:19:48.987 --> 01:19:50.453
Please!

01:19:50.455 --> 01:19:51.654
I can't think!

01:19:51.656 --> 01:19:54.224
...seven, six, five, four...

01:19:54.226 --> 01:19:55.458
Bertha!

01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:57.263
What did she say?

01:19:58.563 --> 01:20:00.997
- Bertha.
- What did you say?

01:20:00.999 --> 01:20:03.936
Bertha-fucking-Mason!

01:20:20.186 --> 01:20:22.552
She said... She said, "Bertha"...

01:20:22.554 --> 01:20:24.688
She said, "Bertha Mason"!

01:20:24.690 --> 01:20:27.224
Mia? Mia? Fuck! Mia?

01:20:27.226 --> 01:20:29.393
She must have learned it in class!

01:20:29.395 --> 01:20:31.394
She must have picked it up!

01:20:31.396 --> 01:20:32.796
She used to look at me like I was

01:20:32.798 --> 01:20:34.198
a piece of shit on her trainers,

01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:35.532
but she listened!

01:20:35.534 --> 01:20:37.167
She must have listened!

01:20:37.169 --> 01:20:39.002
What are you gonna do, Tindall?

01:20:39.004 --> 01:20:41.607
The fuck! Shut the fuck up!

01:20:43.109 --> 01:20:44.509
You're bright, you see?

01:20:45.276 --> 01:20:48.612
- I always knew it!
- Shut the fuck up!

01:20:50.615 --> 01:20:54.717
- Let me get the keys.
- No, no fucking way!

01:20:54.719 --> 01:20:56.252
Then, we're stuck here.

01:20:56.254 --> 01:20:58.590
Someone... someone will come.

01:20:59.525 --> 01:21:01.461
She's bleeding badly.

01:21:02.261 --> 01:21:04.296
Let me get the keys.

01:21:05.164 --> 01:21:07.698
Why the fuck would you get me the keys?

01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:09.035
I give you my word.

01:21:09.701 --> 01:21:11.234
Look what you've done here today,

01:21:11.236 --> 01:21:13.737
how accurate your recall was.

01:21:16.642 --> 01:21:19.542
No one's ever seen it before, have they?

01:21:19.544 --> 01:21:21.613
Your intelligence.

01:21:23.115 --> 01:21:25.448
Why didn't you show it before, Finley?

01:21:25.450 --> 01:21:26.417
Just once.

01:21:26.419 --> 01:21:28.551
Just a spark of what
you've shown here today

01:21:28.553 --> 01:21:29.653
in the classroom.

01:21:29.655 --> 01:21:31.854
All this could have been avoided.

01:21:33.691 --> 01:21:35.727
You're not a killer, Finley.

01:21:36.294 --> 01:21:37.629
Just one thing.

01:21:37.862 --> 01:21:39.499
I'm left-handed.

01:22:02.788 --> 01:22:03.854
Meat!

01:22:03.856 --> 01:22:05.855
Meat with opposable thumbs, remember?

01:22:05.857 --> 01:22:07.427
You taught me that!

01:22:09.727 --> 01:22:12.531
Now! Now, you're just meat!

01:22:13.731 --> 01:22:17.836
Fucking cunting bastard!

01:22:21.173 --> 01:22:23.506
Get me the keys, unlock me,

01:22:23.508 --> 01:22:25.309
and I'll give you your thumbs back.

01:22:25.311 --> 01:22:26.643
Get to a hospital in time,

01:22:26.645 --> 01:22:28.479
and they might just be
able to stitch them back on.

01:22:28.481 --> 01:22:30.783
It's a miracle what they can do nowadays.

01:22:36.422 --> 01:22:38.925
The nerves die the longer you leave it!

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:43.463
Mia!

01:22:47.333 --> 01:22:49.736
Wake the fuck up, Mia!

01:23:06.418 --> 01:23:09.122
Only the educated are free.

01:26:15.007 --> 01:26:17.276
Mia, where's the blanket? I'm cold.

01:26:26.651 --> 01:26:28.753
What the fuck?

01:26:31.356 --> 01:26:32.723
Get out.

01:26:32.725 --> 01:26:33.893
What?

01:26:34.093 --> 01:26:36.028
Get the fuck out!

01:26:36.462 --> 01:26:38.063
Fuck.

01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:11.461
<i>Have you got an
anniversary coming up Chris?</i>

01:27:11.463 --> 01:27:13.063
<i>I certainly have,
thank you very much.</i>

01:27:13.065 --> 01:27:15.131
<i>There's only 20 of these
pieces left and, uh...</i>

01:27:15.133 --> 01:27:17.000
<i>I think you should snap them up.</i>

01:27:17.002 --> 01:27:18.969
<i>I mean, look how the
necklace is, uh...</i>

01:27:18.971 --> 01:27:20.737
<i>It really compliments the earrings.</i>

01:27:25.977 --> 01:27:27.676
<i>...something wrong,
you wanna make it up to her.</i>

01:27:27.678 --> 01:27:29.045
<i>I hope you're not
talking about yourself, Chris.</i>

01:27:29.047 --> 01:27:30.613
<i>Oh, certainly
not. Certainly not.</i>

01:27:30.615 --> 01:27:32.482
<i>I'll be picking up one of
these for my wife anyway.</i>

01:27:32.484 --> 01:27:33.617
<i>You're not the kind of man</i>

01:27:33.619 --> 01:27:34.818
<i>that forgets an
anniversary, are you?</i>

01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:36.153
<i>Certainly not,
but if you are...</i>

01:27:36.155 --> 01:27:38.521
<i>get your credit cards out
and get on the phone now</i>

01:27:38.523 --> 01:27:40.556
<i>to pick up one of these
one-time-special-only pieces.</i>

01:27:40.558 --> 01:27:41.992
<i>Here's the number
on the screen, guys.</i>

01:31:31.822 --> 01:31:34.192
<i>I thought you were
gonna sell that one.</i>

01:31:35.326 --> 01:31:37.362
I want to keep it.

01:31:42.933 --> 01:31:45.571
Do you want anything?

01:31:49.173 --> 01:31:51.110
Yes.

01:33:06.183 --> 01:33:07.352
So...

01:33:08.853 --> 01:33:10.452
What's it all about, huh?

01:33:23.547 --> 01:33:28.547
