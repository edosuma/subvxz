WEBVTT

00:10.719 --> 00:12.220
Andrea and I went for lunch.

00:12.303 --> 00:14.597
- Get up!
- I just reacted.

00:14.681 --> 00:16.891
There was a knife lodged in your hand.

00:16.975 --> 00:19.310
If someone threatens your child…

00:19.394 --> 00:21.021
A storage place called Get-Em-Go…

00:21.104 --> 00:22.647
<i>…you'd do anything to protect them.</i>

00:24.482 --> 00:26.651
Something just… kicks in.

00:26.735 --> 00:28.028
They know where I am now.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.237
<i>They'll go after Andy.</i>

00:29.821 --> 00:32.198
I need the number of the man who sent you.

00:32.282 --> 00:33.908
He's gonna kill you.

00:33.992 --> 00:36.578
Fuck!

00:36.661 --> 00:39.164
- Ms. Oliver, a few questions.
- Back off.

00:39.247 --> 00:40.373
It'd suck to be her.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.792
To be paralyzed with fear
while your mom saves your ass.

00:43.793 --> 00:46.337
Thanks for… you know.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.343
I'm ready to make a statement now.

00:52.427 --> 00:55.305
I need it to go national.
I want everyone to see it.

01:45.104 --> 01:48.107
It's easy for academics
to judge the pharmaceutical industry.

01:48.191 --> 01:50.777
- You can blame capitalism all you--
- I blame you.

02:11.256 --> 02:13.216
We're live in three. Ready?

02:13.299 --> 02:14.425
Uh…

02:14.509 --> 02:15.343
You tell me.

02:16.177 --> 02:17.303
You'll do great.

02:17.929 --> 02:20.306
I'll talk about the work you do
at the Veterans Center.

02:20.390 --> 02:22.684
Your patients must have
some pretty intense war stories.

02:22.767 --> 02:24.185
Learnt that knife move from them?

02:25.144 --> 02:27.856
I'm… I'm sorry. Uh, that light is just…

02:27.939 --> 02:30.358
Hey, Zoe, can we just, uh, turn that down?

02:30.441 --> 02:31.276
Sure.

02:33.361 --> 02:34.362
Thank you.

02:34.904 --> 02:35.738
You okay?

02:35.822 --> 02:37.991
I'm just not used to all this attention.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.451
Why'd you change your mind?

02:41.244 --> 02:45.790
I don't know. I… I guess
if I can reach just one person

02:45.874 --> 02:48.376
who might be thinking
of hurting someone, then…

02:49.502 --> 02:51.629
a little good will have come of all this.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.798
I would love to
pitch you for <i>CNN Heroes.</i>

02:53.882 --> 02:55.341
Maybe with your daughter, too.

02:55.425 --> 02:58.678
You know, Andrea is out of town
for a while. So…

02:58.761 --> 03:00.388
<i>She just needs some rest.</i>

03:46.559 --> 03:48.645
Hey, is there a shortcut to town?

03:48.728 --> 03:49.896
There's only one road.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.523
I mean, if I… I wanted to walk.

03:53.066 --> 03:56.444
Well, there's a path around back,
but it's a long way.

03:58.655 --> 03:59.656
Thanks.

04:29.352 --> 04:32.188
Now,
that's a reliable choice. Hmm?

04:33.189 --> 04:37.318
Yeah, what's better than a dependable,
mid-sized sedan with good pickup?

04:38.403 --> 04:39.404
I don't know. What?

04:41.114 --> 04:42.573
Where are you coming from?

04:44.242 --> 04:45.118
Birmingham.

04:47.203 --> 04:48.329
What'd you do, walk?

04:52.458 --> 04:54.502
Well, what do you think?

04:55.044 --> 04:57.130
All yours for $5,800.

04:59.924 --> 05:01.259
Do you have a bathroom?

05:02.593 --> 05:04.095
Yeah. Yeah, right…

05:31.122 --> 05:35.752
<i>Well, one thing I know</i>
<i>after surviving this…</i>

05:37.712 --> 05:38.755
<i>attack…</i>

05:43.426 --> 05:45.261
<i>…is that something has to change.</i>

05:47.513 --> 05:50.391
<i>You know?</i>
<i>I know people have strong feelings.</i>

05:51.476 --> 05:52.894
<i>I know they're angry.</i>

05:54.520 --> 05:58.149
<i>But it's… It's time</i>
<i>to have a real conversation.</i>

06:01.069 --> 06:04.906
<i>I think we can find a… A truce.</i>

06:06.908 --> 06:10.495
<i>You know, maybe we can all join together,</i>

06:11.621 --> 06:15.291
<i>be our own army for change</i>

06:16.334 --> 06:22.548
<i>so that we can put an end</i>
<i>to this senseless… violence.</i>

06:26.677 --> 06:29.514
<i>Because no one wants to live</i>
<i>with this kind of threat.</i>

06:33.726 --> 06:34.769
<i>No one.</i>

07:00.253 --> 07:01.879
$5,800.

07:05.007 --> 07:08.219
And here I was thinking
you were gonna give me a cashier's check.

07:11.556 --> 07:15.893
What's a little girl doing lugging around
a suitcase and no car?

07:18.438 --> 07:19.397
Do we have a deal?

07:23.192 --> 07:25.069
You know, I forgot.

07:25.153 --> 07:28.448
We just put new radials on that car,

07:28.531 --> 07:33.035
so the new total is, uh, $6,500.

07:46.465 --> 07:47.467
You in trouble?

07:48.926 --> 07:52.221
You need a friend? I can help you out.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.695
Where do I sign?

08:10.823 --> 08:12.450
I'll get the paperwork.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.003
Bessemer, Alabama.

08:25.588 --> 08:26.506
Bass Escrow.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.846
Charlie, it's Andy.

09:18.766 --> 09:19.600
Afternoon.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.937
Sorry, uh, no more interviews.

09:24.855 --> 09:25.898
I'm not a reporter.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.152
Then get off my property.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.612
I'm not here to hurt you.

09:32.989 --> 09:36.409
On the contrary, my employer's happy
to see you're alive and well.

09:40.496 --> 09:42.415
How is everybody in San Francisco?

09:43.374 --> 09:45.209
I have to say you're very telegenic.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.004
So comfortable on camera.

09:48.087 --> 09:51.591
Then again, you grew up
in front of an audience.

09:54.385 --> 09:55.720
But why talk to the press?

09:58.681 --> 10:01.434
Hard to avoid them
when they're camped outside my house.

10:02.101 --> 10:05.229
But then you invited them
to join your army of change.

10:06.522 --> 10:09.400
- I thought you didn't want attention.
- What is your point?

10:12.069 --> 10:13.654
I think we can help each other.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.657
- What are you offering?
- Safety. Support.

10:17.366 --> 10:20.369
I'm guessing you could do
with a little time away.

10:21.787 --> 10:24.999
Maybe somewhere out of the country
until things settle down.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.172
Do you know where he is?

10:33.049 --> 10:34.425
Has he reached out to you?

10:37.303 --> 10:38.471
Then you can't help me.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.057
If you come anywhere near me again,

10:41.140 --> 10:44.977
I will go to the cops,
and I will tell them exactly what I know.

10:46.228 --> 10:47.938
I saw your daughter on the news.

10:51.025 --> 10:52.902
Now, we can take care of her, too.

10:56.238 --> 10:57.615
That's all any of us want…

10:59.617 --> 11:01.369
is to keep our children safe.

11:04.872 --> 11:05.998
Give it some thought.

11:08.209 --> 11:09.543
You know how to reach us.

11:39.448 --> 11:40.282
Charlie.

11:41.534 --> 11:42.576
Good to see you.

11:42.660 --> 11:43.536
Yeah.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.663
- Hmm.

11:47.164 --> 11:48.040
Come on in.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.918
<i>As I say in my book,</i>

11:51.001 --> 11:53.879
<i>there's a lot in this country</i>
<i>that needs to change,</i>

11:53.963 --> 11:57.675
<i>and instead of venting on Twitter,</i>
<i>I thought I'd do something about it.</i>

11:57.758 --> 11:59.635
<i>From insiders at the DNC,</i>

11:59.718 --> 12:01.762
<i>your name is on the shortlist</i>
<i>for vice president.</i>

12:01.846 --> 12:03.973
<i>It's way too early to predict</i>

12:04.056 --> 12:06.642
<i>who Senator Shepard will pick</i>
<i>as her running mate.</i>

12:06.726 --> 12:07.977
<i>But you are on the list.</i>

12:08.060 --> 12:11.188
<i>Okay. I'd love to be considered,</i>
<i>no question.</i>

12:12.356 --> 12:16.318
<i>Are you surprised you've made it this far,</i>
<i>considering your family history?</i>

12:18.487 --> 12:20.448
<i>I'm glad you brought that up.</i>

12:21.574 --> 12:27.621
<i>My, uh… father's murder</i>
<i>was a defining moment for me.</i>

12:27.830 --> 12:28.914
<i>I, uh…</i>

12:29.498 --> 12:34.962
<i>I realized how fragile things are and that</i>
<i>nothing matters but the people you love.</i>

12:35.045 --> 12:38.799
<i>Nick Harp, the man behind</i>
<i>your father's death, is still a fugitive.</i>

12:38.883 --> 12:41.385
<i>Why do you think</i>
<i>no one's been able to catch him?</i>

12:42.011 --> 12:43.929
<i>I think</i>
<i>that's a question for the FBI.</i>

12:44.013 --> 12:47.433
<i>Do you believe the Army of</i>
<i>the Changing World still poses a threat?</i>

12:47.516 --> 12:50.478
<i>You're asking about things</i>
<i>that happened 30 years ago.</i>

12:50.561 --> 12:53.898
<i>This country is facing</i>
<i>real challenges right now,</i>

12:53.981 --> 12:56.317
<i>and that's what I'm here</i>
<i>to talk about tonight.</i>

12:56.400 --> 12:58.527
<i>Many people associate</i>
<i>your family's company</i>

12:58.611 --> 13:02.114
<i>with questionable business practices,</i>
<i>corruption, racketeering.</i>

13:02.198 --> 13:03.908
<i>What do you say to the skeptics?</i>

14:14.603 --> 14:15.437
Hello?

14:18.232 --> 14:19.149
<i>Hello, Jane.</i>

14:24.321 --> 14:25.447
What's going on, Andy?

14:26.532 --> 14:30.119
A man… broke into our house.

14:30.703 --> 14:31.704
What man?

14:35.165 --> 14:36.041
I don't know.

14:38.002 --> 14:39.420
He… He's gone.

14:40.379 --> 14:44.550
And then last night, I was at this bar,
and there was a guy. I…

14:45.467 --> 14:46.969
I think he was following me.

14:48.679 --> 14:50.931
I don't know.
Maybe he wasn't. Maybe I just…

14:53.976 --> 14:56.145
Mom sent me to this storage unit.

14:56.228 --> 14:59.440
There was all this money
in a suitcase and…

14:59.982 --> 15:02.484
I'm sounding crazy, right?

15:02.568 --> 15:03.986
This is crazy.

15:10.242 --> 15:11.911
I found this in the storage unit.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.247
Do you think my dad did this?

15:15.331 --> 15:16.248
Jerry?

15:17.374 --> 15:18.417
I don't know.

15:20.878 --> 15:22.421
She never talks about him.

15:23.213 --> 15:25.382
There's one photo of him
in the whole house.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.593
Maybe this is why?

15:28.302 --> 15:31.013
She told me she was devastated
when he died.

15:32.848 --> 15:34.683
That's why she moved down south.

15:35.684 --> 15:36.560
To start over.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.028
Do you know Paula Koontz?

15:46.862 --> 15:47.696
Who?

15:49.365 --> 15:50.783
Mom mentioned her name. I…

15:51.825 --> 15:54.286
No, I've never heard of her.

15:57.456 --> 15:58.666
You must be wrecked.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.418
Carrollton's a long drive.

16:04.004 --> 16:05.964
Did I say I was coming from Carrollton?

16:07.049 --> 16:07.925
Yeah, you did.

16:08.008 --> 16:09.927
You also said you were going to Maine.

16:10.010 --> 16:12.638
You know, what you need
is a meal and some sleep.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.393
I'll fix you some eggs.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.658
How did you and Mom meet again?

16:33.242 --> 16:34.118
What's that?

16:39.123 --> 16:41.750
You helped her and Gordon
with the loan on our house?

16:44.002 --> 16:44.962
Hmm.

16:47.423 --> 16:50.968
Yes, and I painted your room
that awful color you wanted.

16:52.636 --> 16:53.554
Bubblegum pink.

16:56.890 --> 16:58.892
You still take TABASCO on your eggs?

17:00.019 --> 17:01.186
Uh, yeah.

17:51.361 --> 17:52.780
How come you never married?

17:54.865 --> 17:57.076
Well, I guess I never
found the right person.

18:29.274 --> 18:31.860
Hey! Where you going?

18:54.967 --> 18:56.135
Mr. Oliver?

18:59.012 --> 19:00.097
Is everything okay?

19:04.393 --> 19:05.978
Are the Crown Cork people here?

19:06.937 --> 19:08.272
Andy's on line one.

19:13.277 --> 19:14.611
- Hey.
- <i>Charlie knew</i>

19:14.695 --> 19:17.281
I was coming from Carrollton,
but I didn't tell him.

19:17.364 --> 19:19.241
So, how could he know where I was?

19:19.324 --> 19:20.158
Okay. Slow down.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.785
Did you know Charlie's married?

19:21.869 --> 19:24.246
He's been lying this whole time.
I had to leave.

19:24.329 --> 19:25.330
Tell me where you are.

19:26.748 --> 19:27.666
<i>Andy.</i>

19:28.876 --> 19:30.961
Andy, Andy, are you there?

19:31.879 --> 19:35.674
It's all bullshit,
everything she's ever told me.

19:36.925 --> 19:39.845
Someone needs to tell me what's going on
because I'm gonna lose it.

19:39.928 --> 19:42.181
- Let me come get you.
- No. Just tell me the truth.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.141
- Okay.
<i>- One true thing.</i>

19:44.224 --> 19:46.059
Just tell me one true thing!

19:46.143 --> 19:48.437
Of course. Of course.

19:48.520 --> 19:52.482
Charlie, he came to my birthdays,
my graduation.

19:52.566 --> 19:54.401
He knows everything about me.

19:55.068 --> 19:57.154
Is Charlie who he says he is?

20:02.951 --> 20:04.077
No.

20:04.161 --> 20:05.329
Then who is he?

20:07.080 --> 20:08.582
It's complicated, Andy.

20:08.665 --> 20:09.791
Just tell me.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.210
<i>You tell me where you are.</i>

20:11.710 --> 20:12.586
Uh…

20:13.295 --> 20:16.465
I don't know. It… It doesn't matter.

20:16.548 --> 20:19.134
<i>Andrea, just tell me where you are.</i>

20:20.469 --> 20:24.223
Listen. I need you to go to the nearest
police station and wait for me.

20:24.306 --> 20:25.265
I'll pick you up.

20:25.349 --> 20:27.100
<i>I can't go to the police.</i>

20:27.684 --> 20:29.019
You don't understand.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.104
Something really bad happened.

20:31.188 --> 20:33.023
<i>I need you to listen to me.</i>

20:33.106 --> 20:36.276
<i>I love you, and nothing</i>
<i>will ever change that. Nothing.</i>

20:37.110 --> 20:39.446
<i>And whatever this is, I'm gonna fix it.</i>

20:39.529 --> 20:40.572
I can't.

20:44.326 --> 20:45.410
There was a man who--

20:45.494 --> 20:46.370
I know.

20:50.165 --> 20:51.124
Mom told you?

20:52.209 --> 20:54.920
We'll talk about it
when I pick you up, okay?

20:55.003 --> 20:55.963
Promise you.

20:56.046 --> 20:57.839
Why can't we talk about it now?

20:57.923 --> 21:00.175
Why is this happening?
Who's mom afraid of?

21:00.259 --> 21:02.302
<i>Andy, just go somewhere safe.</i>

21:03.595 --> 21:04.930
Is it Paula Koontz?

21:05.973 --> 21:06.807
Who?

21:06.890 --> 21:08.934
You heard me. Paula Koontz.

21:12.896 --> 21:14.064
I don't know that name.

21:14.147 --> 21:16.066
Yes, you do. Who is she?

21:16.149 --> 21:17.776
<i>Andy, I swear, I don't know her.</i>

21:18.652 --> 21:19.569
Are you sure?

21:20.529 --> 21:24.241
When we got home from the hospital,
I asked you what was going on with mom,

21:24.324 --> 21:25.951
you fucking lied to me.

21:26.034 --> 21:28.203
And it wasn't the first time, was it?

21:28.287 --> 21:30.414
You know a lot of things
you never told me.

21:30.998 --> 21:33.166
Guess I'll have to figure them out myself.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.536
Hi. What's wrong?

22:09.619 --> 22:10.871
Have you talked to Andy?

22:10.954 --> 22:12.122
Yeah. Meeting her in Camden.

22:12.205 --> 22:14.624
- Spending a few days together.
- I don't think so.

22:14.708 --> 22:17.669
- What do you mean?
- She went to see Charlie.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.716
What? She drove to Alabama?

22:22.799 --> 22:23.633
Yeah.

22:25.260 --> 22:27.804
And she's scared to death.
She needs to come home.

22:27.888 --> 22:30.432
No, what she needs to do
is listen to her mother.

22:30.515 --> 22:32.017
Then why did she call me and not you?

22:32.100 --> 22:33.643
You tell her what she wants to hear.

22:33.727 --> 22:34.686
Laura, who's Paula?

22:37.064 --> 22:39.900
- Who's Paula, Laura?
- I don't know.

22:39.983 --> 22:41.818
Oh, come on.
We don't have time to do this.

22:41.902 --> 22:45.322
Gordon, you've done enough. Thank you.
But please just stay out of this.

22:45.405 --> 22:47.157
- Too late for that.
- I'll handle it.

22:47.240 --> 22:49.368
I'm not gonna let anyone
hurt our daughter.

22:51.411 --> 22:52.662
My daughter, you mean?

23:46.883 --> 23:50.846
Hi. Sorry. Excuse me. Um… Do you mind
if I just borrow that for a second?

23:50.929 --> 23:52.639
I just need to look something up.

23:53.807 --> 23:54.683
Um…

24:01.398 --> 24:02.357
We're leaving soon.

24:02.941 --> 24:03.817
Thank you.

25:38.161 --> 25:39.496
I need that back.

25:40.121 --> 25:41.414
This place is for families.

25:41.498 --> 25:42.332
Right. Uh…

25:42.874 --> 25:43.959
Sorry, of course.

26:00.225 --> 26:01.059
Hello?

26:01.142 --> 26:03.144
Oh, Andy. Thank God.

26:03.228 --> 26:04.396
I can't hear you.

26:06.064 --> 26:07.065
<i>Where are you?</i>

26:08.233 --> 26:09.901
I don't know. Alabama, somewhere.

26:09.985 --> 26:11.444
I told you to drive north.

26:13.029 --> 26:15.615
It's not safe for you
to be out there on your own.

26:16.199 --> 26:17.659
Why? Tell me why.

26:18.618 --> 26:21.496
There are people looking for me.

26:22.622 --> 26:23.832
Like Paula?

26:25.458 --> 26:29.337
No, no. She, um…
She's not part of this. No.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.881
And Charlie? He's not part of this?

26:31.965 --> 26:33.008
And Gordon?

26:33.091 --> 26:36.177
<i>I went to that storage unit</i>
<i>and found all the fake IDs of your face.</i>

26:36.261 --> 26:39.556
And you know what I realized?
None of those IDs are for me.

26:39.639 --> 26:41.349
So, how was that gonna work?

26:41.433 --> 26:44.394
You make your grand escape
and then just gonna leave me?

26:46.187 --> 26:47.063
Uh…

26:50.025 --> 26:51.318
Hello?

26:51.401 --> 26:54.029
Andy, please, not on the phone. Okay?

26:54.112 --> 26:57.157
Just let me come get you,
and I can explain.

27:02.871 --> 27:04.748
No, I'll come home.

27:04.831 --> 27:07.375
<i>No, I don't want you out there</i>
<i>on your own.</i>

27:07.459 --> 27:10.170
I said I'll come home.
I can be there by midnight.

27:12.589 --> 27:14.007
Are you sure?

27:15.884 --> 27:17.969
I'm leaving now. I won't stop anywhere.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.347
Okay. Thank you. Thank you, baby.

27:20.430 --> 27:21.973
If you need anything, call me.

27:22.057 --> 27:24.893
I have my phone on. Okay?
I have it with me, and it's on.

27:25.435 --> 27:26.561
And I love you.

27:29.022 --> 27:29.856
Yeah.

29:35.231 --> 29:37.859
Hey. I'm calling about Laura and Andy.

30:06.721 --> 30:07.972
Mommy?

30:08.056 --> 30:09.015
Shh.

30:42.715 --> 30:43.883
Where are we going?

30:44.634 --> 30:46.261
To a big lake with waves.

30:46.344 --> 30:47.345
Why?

30:47.428 --> 30:49.389
Don't you want to see where Mommy grew up?

30:49.472 --> 30:50.807
Is Dad coming?

30:50.890 --> 30:51.891
I'm cold.

30:52.475 --> 30:54.060
Hey, you'll be warm in just a second.

30:54.143 --> 30:55.645
I need my monkey.

30:55.728 --> 30:58.523
We're going on an adventure.
Isn't this exciting?

30:58.606 --> 30:59.440
No.

30:59.524 --> 31:02.944
Just rest your eyes,
and when you wake up, we'll be there.

31:03.027 --> 31:06.030
God dammit, Annette!
Get out of the car! Now!

31:06.114 --> 31:08.241
- Mommy!
- I said get out of the car!

31:08.324 --> 31:11.077
- It's okay, baby.
- You're not going anywhere!

31:11.744 --> 31:14.163
You are not taking them.
That is not gonna happen.

31:14.247 --> 31:15.081
Dad?

31:15.164 --> 31:17.500
You're out of your mind, Annette.

31:17.584 --> 31:20.420
I'll lock you up,
and you're never gonna see the children.

31:20.503 --> 31:23.256
- Turn that damn thing off!

31:28.052 --> 31:30.805
I'll raise them myself,
we don't need you anymore.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.057
You'll have nothing, you hear me? Nothing.

31:33.141 --> 31:34.809
Not a goddamn thing.

31:34.892 --> 31:36.227
I'll do it.

31:36.311 --> 31:37.812
I'll run you over.

31:41.357 --> 31:42.775
Go ahead, try it.

31:42.859 --> 31:44.110
I will never let you take them.

31:46.446 --> 31:48.323
Come on. Everyone back in the house.

31:48.406 --> 31:51.451
Mommy. No. Mommy!

33:00.978 --> 33:03.398
It's at the back,
down the corridor to the right.

33:03.481 --> 33:05.191
- Thanks.
- Thanks. Hi.

33:05.274 --> 33:07.151
I'd like to see Geraldine Ross.

33:07.235 --> 33:08.361
Do you have an appointment?

33:08.444 --> 33:11.406
Uh, no, but it's about
one of her clients, Paula Kunde.

33:12.073 --> 33:14.993
Ms. Ross does not give statements
about ongoing legal matters.

33:15.076 --> 33:16.452
I'm not a reporter.

33:16.536 --> 33:19.664
I'm making a documentary
on sentencing reform,

33:19.747 --> 33:21.165
and I want to talk to Paula.

33:21.249 --> 33:23.251
I'm sorry, it's not that simple.

33:24.085 --> 33:25.586
I know. I called Carswell,

33:25.670 --> 33:27.839
and they said I need to get
on some list to get in,

33:27.922 --> 33:29.590
so if I could just speak with Ms. Ross…

33:29.674 --> 33:32.176
There's a $400 charge
for an initial consult.

33:33.136 --> 33:33.970
Sold.

33:39.600 --> 33:44.105
Okay, well, the next available appointment
is in three weeks.

33:44.188 --> 33:46.107
Monday at 10:00. Does that work?

33:48.109 --> 33:50.570
I was hoping for something today.

33:50.653 --> 33:52.196
Three weeks out is the earliest.

33:54.657 --> 33:56.367
McDowell & Ross, may I help you?

34:02.206 --> 34:04.417
He'll be back on Friday.

34:11.007 --> 34:12.425
Okay. Thanks.

34:14.594 --> 34:17.013
God, I hate this weather.

34:17.096 --> 34:18.306
Next time, let's drive.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.266
- Here.
- That's Geraldine's.

34:20.349 --> 34:22.852
- I'll get the next one.
- Drinks tonight?

34:22.935 --> 34:25.521
- Can't. Dance class.
- Exercise is overrated.

34:25.605 --> 34:27.315
Stop it.

34:27.398 --> 34:30.443
- Come on, one drink.

34:30.526 --> 34:31.819
We're gonna be late.

34:33.196 --> 34:34.113
You coming?

34:34.197 --> 34:36.699
I hate that unisex bathroom.
Todd is gross.

35:44.142 --> 35:47.395
I really need a makeover.
What color is that?

35:48.396 --> 35:49.272
Hard Pass.

35:49.981 --> 35:51.816
Sounds like the last guy I met.

35:52.859 --> 35:56.612
Oh, shit! Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

35:56.696 --> 35:58.406
I'll get it. I'm late.

35:58.489 --> 36:00.741
Oh. It's all in the bottom.

36:01.784 --> 36:03.619
- No! Sorry.
- Just… Just… Just let me.

36:03.703 --> 36:06.789
Sorry. I'm… I'm really, really sorry.

36:35.693 --> 36:36.861
And you're open till?

36:38.946 --> 36:40.114
Great. Thanks.

37:22.698 --> 37:23.616
Hey, Jane.

37:25.618 --> 37:26.577
You've been busy.
