01:14.449 --> 01:19.977
Rosetta's in intensive care and the rest
of them, they've just disappeared. Gone!

01:20.539 --> 01:24.168
Everything's gone to hell.
Get that camera off me!

01:43.645 --> 01:47.440
5-80-pro times four, got about
a dozen more in the car.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.984
Check. Head cam set times three -

01:49.985 --> 01:53.455
that's one, two... Where
the hell is the other one?

01:56.241 --> 01:58.200
Ah, modelled by the handsome
man in the mirror.

01:58.201 --> 01:59.827
What else?

02:00.662 --> 02:04.498
Got my LED, two D - yes.
My work light - yes.

02:04.499 --> 02:06.546
Fuck it, let's get some coffee.

02:38.784 --> 02:40.627
Bollocks.

02:51.922 --> 02:55.517
Alright, mate. You're Deacon?
I'm Gray.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.894
Hi.
- I'm the tech specialist.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.935
You not worked with one before?

03:03.058 --> 03:04.809
Well, basically I'm in
charge of the camera,

03:04.810 --> 03:07.062
the microphones, all that kind of stuff.

03:08.313 --> 03:10.440
What do you make of the luxury cottage?

03:11.149 --> 03:14.402
Right now running water
sounds like luxury.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.070
You're not local?
- Fuck, no.

03:16.071 --> 03:20.282
Christ, I couldn't live around here.
There's no Wi-Fi, no broadband, no cable.

03:20.283 --> 03:22.159
Basically it's like the middle ages.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.786
You wanna see the room?
- Yeah, that'll be good.

03:23.787 --> 03:25.288
Come on.

03:28.417 --> 03:30.464
Me and you are in here, man.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.046
We're sharing?

03:33.797 --> 03:35.423
We're sharing?
- Yeah, well, the main man

03:35.424 --> 03:37.176
gets the master bedroom.

03:37.384 --> 03:40.683
Do you know him? Something Amidon.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.518
Mark?
- Yeah, that's it.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.266
Great.
- I left a load of crap

03:45.267 --> 03:48.771
on your bed, but I'll sort all
that out. You want a beer?

03:48.854 --> 03:52.198
Tell you what, you sort out the
bed and I'll put the kettle on.

03:55.736 --> 04:00.616
Well, I didn't do a Breathalyzer
test but he seemed sober enough.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.914
For a Scotsman anyway.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.537
Yeah, I know, I am serious.

04:06.538 --> 04:11.418
It just makes me uncomfortable,
all this Big Brother shit.

04:12.461 --> 04:15.129
I'm a techie, mate. If you
want your audio clean,

04:15.130 --> 04:18.474
your white balance shiny,
then I'm your man, but...

04:21.887 --> 04:25.516
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the bonus
is very generous, but...

04:26.980 --> 04:28.684
By the way, is that
gonna be paid in cash?

04:28.685 --> 04:31.608
Because it makes the paper
work a bit... Oh, I'd better go.

04:33.148 --> 04:36.276
I made you tea.
- Cheers, mate.

04:36.318 --> 04:39.697
Women, ey...
- I wouldn't know.

04:44.034 --> 04:48.380
Deacon! Deacon, come on, mate.
Let's get you kitted out.

04:48.663 --> 04:50.581
This is ridiculous.
- Well maybe,

04:50.582 --> 04:52.917
but it's also regulations.
Oh come on, mate.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.376
I've been wearing mine two days already

04:54.377 --> 04:56.837
and I can barely even notice
it's there anymore.

04:56.838 --> 04:59.386
That's it.
- You probably enjoy it.

05:00.467 --> 05:05.346
Right, listen. Rule number one: I
am not wearing this in the toilet,

05:05.347 --> 05:07.932
not unless the toilet is weeping
blood or something.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.141
Alright, fine. When you have a poo

05:09.142 --> 05:11.519
or a shower you can take it off,
but the rest of the time

05:11.520 --> 05:13.442
they want it on, alright?

05:14.940 --> 05:17.525
I've been promoted to tripod.

05:17.526 --> 05:22.321
It's all been since Belem. Apparently they
had massive gaps in the timeline at Belem

05:22.322 --> 05:24.620
and they wanna plug them using these.

06:12.414 --> 06:14.712
Morning.
- Yeah.

06:17.502 --> 06:19.299
Crap-

06:20.922 --> 06:23.140
Deacon, where's your head cam?

06:24.885 --> 06:29.265
Look mate, it's not you who
gets it in the neck, alright?

06:29.931 --> 06:33.526
Please. I'll sort that out. Please.

06:37.606 --> 06:39.232
What have you done here?

06:40.859 --> 06:42.861
Get a wiggle on, mate.

06:43.695 --> 06:46.280
Yep, alright.
- What are you doing?

06:46.281 --> 06:50.911
Going to have a fag. You mind if I smoke?
- Yes.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.248
Excuse me...

06:56.082 --> 06:57.582
What?

06:59.961 --> 07:05.961
You know it's like, you can't imagine this
place is gonna be the stuff of legend,

07:06.718 --> 07:10.137
like the Arthurian legend in years to come.
- Name me a place that is.

07:10.138 --> 07:12.185
Camelot?

07:13.600 --> 07:17.400
Betting shop, fish bar, laundry.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.857
That's life in miniature.

07:21.316 --> 07:25.446
Food, cleanliness and a
little bit of naughty.

07:27.697 --> 07:30.495
So how long you've worked for
the congregation, Deacon?

07:35.664 --> 07:41.642
So I imagine you must have seen
a lot of insane and spooky stuff.

07:42.357 --> 07:44.421
I don't know about you dude,
but I'm looking forward

07:44.422 --> 07:48.267
to seeing some really wired shit.

07:49.803 --> 07:53.182
Is there anything I should...
- Yeah.

07:53.765 --> 07:55.517
Don't get your hopes up.

07:59.562 --> 08:02.440
Dude, have you just bought booze?

08:14.160 --> 08:20.233
It's gone, it's back, it's gone,
it's back. It's gone, it's back!

08:21.584 --> 08:23.084
Come here.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.005
Where are we?
- Hang on, where are we...

08:26.006 --> 08:29.008
The village, the church...

08:29.009 --> 08:33.178
Right, that's the cottage just
there and there's the church.

08:33.179 --> 08:36.890
Look on the map. You know the
sign for a church, don't you?

08:36.890 --> 08:39.058
It's a little round thing with a
cross, see if you can find it.

08:39.059 --> 08:41.028
It's in this area here.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.274
You can't just dial it into a computer.

08:45.275 --> 08:47.072
"Nutsley".

08:48.278 --> 08:51.076
Yeah well, that's not where
the church is. Look here!

08:52.699 --> 08:54.701
"Bullshurst".

08:58.955 --> 09:03.667
"Bullcone". "Bullcone". "Bullcone".

09:03.668 --> 09:06.011
Yeah, it says "Bullcone".

09:16.389 --> 09:17.973
Nah.
- Dude, come on!

09:17.974 --> 09:20.350
No, good luck. No really, it's fine.
You go for it. I'll come back.

09:20.351 --> 09:21.977
You're a misery guts!
- I'll come back.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.437
No, alright, I'll get the corners done,

09:23.438 --> 09:25.314
then you can do the fun
bit - filling in the middle.

09:25.315 --> 09:28.443
Yeah, perfect, okay.
I'll see you around March!

09:30.945 --> 09:32.788
I got a corner!

09:49.506 --> 09:51.724
It's a bit late for the bells, isn't it?

09:53.176 --> 09:54.677
Yeah.

10:43.045 --> 10:44.309
Dude, the rules are very clear.

10:44.310 --> 10:47.938
We need to wait for the -what's his
name?- the Realtor General, Amidon.

10:47.939 --> 10:50.315
Relator, and he should've
been here yesterday.

10:50.316 --> 10:55.737
Dude, even so.
- Right, fine. I'm now going up to the site.

10:55.738 --> 10:58.073
But you know I'm not very technical
inclined. I just hope

10:58.074 --> 11:02.920
all this delicate equipment doesn't...
- Dude, calm down, man!

11:05.665 --> 11:08.375
You've ever known any Buddhists, Deacon?

11:08.376 --> 11:09.835
Sorry?
- Have you ever known any Buddhists?

11:09.836 --> 11:11.503
I had a girlfriend who was a Buddhist;

11:11.504 --> 11:14.803
she did a vow of silence,
it was fucking brilliant!

11:18.928 --> 11:23.265
You know, the accelerator is
not an on-off button, Gray.

11:23.266 --> 11:27.477
It's something you can press
and depress gently.

11:27.478 --> 11:29.400
Yeah, well, I just turn around.

11:32.150 --> 11:35.824
There we go. Thanks mate. Tit!

11:36.487 --> 11:39.948
Are we there yet?
- No, fucking sat-nav's fucked.

11:39.949 --> 11:43.076
It has taken us in a
massive shitty circle.

11:43.077 --> 11:45.124
Yeah, ask this fella here.

11:45.747 --> 11:49.342
He looks like an agreeable
local bumpkin type.

11:49.417 --> 11:52.636
Hi, can you tell us where the
church is round here please?

11:53.004 --> 11:56.924
Yeah, you know, it's a big pointy
building with a spire on top.

11:56.925 --> 11:58.425
Please be quiet.
- God's house!

11:58.426 --> 12:01.270
Please be quiet.
- Alright.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.307
His name's father Crellick.

12:09.312 --> 12:13.607
Right, okay... Thanks very much for
your time. Sorry to bother you.

12:13.608 --> 12:15.692
Have a cracking day, mate!
- Have a good trip.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.695
Good luck with it!

12:24.577 --> 12:26.203
Can you smell that?

12:26.788 --> 12:28.505
It's cows.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.458
I hate cows.

12:44.347 --> 12:46.565
Why do people do this?

12:47.058 --> 12:50.936
Satanists, supposedly. They
record messages on them.

12:50.937 --> 12:54.441
Spells, curses, that sort of thing...
- Curses?

12:56.567 --> 12:58.067
I got it.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.257
Oh dude.

13:17.130 --> 13:21.851
That's nature for you, Deacon.
Big stuff eating little stuff.

13:44.866 --> 13:47.664
One glance in the bible
will tell you that.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.997
Or take the miracle of Lanciano.

13:52.123 --> 13:57.252
In the year 700 a Basilian monk had doubts
over the actual physical presence

13:57.253 --> 14:00.097
of Jesus Christ in the holy Eucharist.

14:00.214 --> 14:06.219
While he was performing the
ceremony, before his eyes

14:06.220 --> 14:10.932
the bread and the wine transformed
into chunks of living flesh.

14:10.933 --> 14:14.811
The question is: Do you give cows names?

14:14.812 --> 14:18.907
My mate at school, Scott Andrews,

14:19.442 --> 14:25.405
he said he gives his cows names,
or did when he was a kid,

14:25.406 --> 14:28.625
and then they couldn't kill them.
They got like attached to them

14:29.285 --> 14:34.873
and then that cow ended up living
with them for like about 14 years -

14:34.874 --> 14:39.925
the life span of a cow. They said
it was a massive pain in the arse.

14:46.219 --> 14:49.017
Cheery stuff.
You alright?

14:49.263 --> 14:51.731
I'm alright, yeah. Just
hanging with my home boy.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.738
Afternoon, Barry.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.663
Father Crellick?

15:11.119 --> 15:13.542
I think you've been expecting us.

15:15.039 --> 15:19.126
Oh yes, of course! I wasn't sure
what time you'd be arriving.

15:19.127 --> 15:23.213
The Relator General has been delayed
but I'm Deacon and this is Gray.

15:23.214 --> 15:24.714
Alright.

15:25.675 --> 15:29.177
I was under the impression that you fellows
would make me feel underdressed.

15:29.178 --> 15:34.724
"You all shall be dressed in humility,
for God resists the proud"

15:34.725 --> 15:37.853
"and gives grace to the humble."

15:41.065 --> 15:44.159
I'll show you where it happened.
- Thank you.

16:11.304 --> 16:14.347
The decision of dedication
that you make today

16:14.348 --> 16:19.103
is one of the most sacred and
significant you may declare.

16:20.062 --> 16:22.235
I baptize thee

16:22.732 --> 16:28.363
in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy...

16:32.617 --> 16:34.118
What's that?

16:51.302 --> 16:52.803
Father...

16:56.516 --> 16:59.809
That is mental! Have you seen this?
- Yes.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.903
That is nuts!

17:02.396 --> 17:03.896
It's great.

17:04.690 --> 17:08.484
So how long have you been
here, father Crellick?

17:08.486 --> 17:11.154
This has been a project of
mine for a few years now.

17:11.155 --> 17:16.001
The diocese finally acquiesced and we
opened just over two months ago.

17:17.118 --> 17:20.121
These are the church records
you asked for.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.794
Great, thanks.

17:22.541 --> 17:28.003
I don't quite understand. These
cameras, are they necessary?

17:28.005 --> 17:31.475
We have to fully investigate every claim.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.052
Claim?

17:34.470 --> 17:37.430
What claim? We all saw it!

17:37.431 --> 17:42.687
It was a very impressive video, father
Crellick, else we wouldn't be here.

17:44.146 --> 17:48.321
It's not brain surgery.
It's a fundamentally simple kit.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.577
HD cameras.

17:50.611 --> 17:54.661
In this case: pro 5-80s.

17:55.908 --> 17:59.002
Electric screwdriver -
one for me,

17:59.412 --> 18:00.959
one for you.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.508
Okay.

18:28.649 --> 18:31.948
It's getting late. Fancy a drink?
- Yeah.

18:44.999 --> 18:47.376
Evening.
- Evening.

18:48.169 --> 18:51.138
Gray, let's get these off, yeah?

18:53.924 --> 18:56.051
You got Wi-Fi here by any chance?

18:56.802 --> 18:58.849
Dude, I can't believe that video.

18:59.555 --> 19:02.899
That's nuts. I must have
watched that 50 times today.

19:03.559 --> 19:06.811
What happens if we
actually find something?

19:06.812 --> 19:09.564
If we see something we report
it and then they decide

19:09.565 --> 19:11.567
whether to follow it up.

19:12.109 --> 19:13.818
What, that's it?
- Yeah, that's it.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.904
And then we're onto the next job.

19:15.905 --> 19:18.073
We're here to observe and report.

19:18.074 --> 19:20.201
We don't make the decisions.

19:20.951 --> 19:25.455
They only recognize miracles
in very, very few cases.

19:25.456 --> 19:30.211
Look, we get a lot of time wasters.
- But that video

19:30.836 --> 19:33.880
is impressive. I mean,
you said that yourself!

19:33.881 --> 19:37.050
No, no, no, it is, definitely!
I didn't think

19:37.051 --> 19:40.595
father Crellick had it in him. I thought
we would have seen the strings.

19:40.596 --> 19:44.475
You're saying all that was fake?
- Yes.

19:44.558 --> 19:46.935
What, all the stuff?

19:47.978 --> 19:51.439
Even that thing at the end?
- What - on the camera?

19:51.440 --> 19:53.942
I don't know. It was a
glitch or something.

19:55.403 --> 19:58.827
So that girl in Spain last year, with the

19:59.073 --> 20:03.828
stigmata. You can't fake that.
- No, I was there for that one.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.162
And?
- Fake.

20:06.163 --> 20:08.248
No it wasn't.
- And not a very good one.

20:08.249 --> 20:12.674
Dude, you can't fake stigmata,
there are holes in your hands.

20:13.421 --> 20:16.720
So what was it - hidden blood
capsules or something?

20:16.924 --> 20:19.222
No, it was much simpler.

20:19.427 --> 20:28.187
Every day for ten weeks the girl's mother
cut her hands and feet open.

20:30.104 --> 20:35.360
The girl got septicemia. Do you
know what her mother said to me

20:35.401 --> 20:37.278
after she died?

20:38.279 --> 20:43.125
Now you can make my girl a saint.

21:10.895 --> 21:14.319
I see his nibs has arrived.

21:25.326 --> 21:30.127
My dear brother Deacon.
The prodigal son returns.

21:32.374 --> 21:36.629
You are still one of us,
aren't you, Deacon?

21:37.797 --> 21:40.298
Hello Mark, how's is
the Vatican these days?

21:40.299 --> 21:43.593
You should really come and see
for yourself once in a while.

21:43.594 --> 21:46.846
And this must be our technical
specialist. I'm Father Amidon.

21:46.847 --> 21:48.181
Alright, how're you doing?
- Call me Mark.

21:48.182 --> 21:49.516
A pleasure.
- Sorry about the delay,

21:49.517 --> 21:51.267
I was at a fundraiser in Boston.

21:51.268 --> 21:53.770
I'm really intrigued to see the set up.

21:54.104 --> 21:58.858
We've got all the cameras set up on site.
- The regulations clearly state

21:58.859 --> 22:02.195
that the entire team must be in
place before commencing anything.

22:02.196 --> 22:05.370
That would mean...
- Don't blame him, Mark.

22:05.491 --> 22:08.870
It was my idea.
- Why am I not surprised about that?

22:11.747 --> 22:15.208
Yeah, well... Church records.

22:15.209 --> 22:17.427
Thought they might be useful.

22:21.298 --> 22:22.798
Right.

22:23.551 --> 22:25.051
Gray.

22:25.928 --> 22:27.725
Yeah. Night, mate.

22:28.347 --> 22:31.726
You'll be wanting to fit my
head cam, no doubt.

22:32.810 --> 22:34.311
Yeah, sure.

22:44.488 --> 22:47.241
He can be very persuasive,
our brother Deacon.

22:48.576 --> 22:50.874
He doesn't really like taking orders.

22:53.163 --> 22:57.088
All you need to remember,
Gray, is who's in charge.

22:59.461 --> 23:00.961
Right.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.100
Chip forks,

23:07.219 --> 23:11.389
tartar, ketchup, what not.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.982
Tuck in.

23:18.647 --> 23:20.319
Did you hear that?

23:21.525 --> 23:23.026
Listen!

23:29.408 --> 23:33.378
You're imagining things.
- Let's eat, it's getting cold.

23:41.795 --> 23:46.675
What the fuck is that?
- Where's the fire extinguisher?

23:52.014 --> 23:53.515
Are you alright?

23:54.975 --> 23:57.148
Stay back, stay back!

24:06.278 --> 24:07.778
What is it?

24:11.116 --> 24:12.708
What happened?

24:12.826 --> 24:14.794
What are you doing?

24:20.918 --> 24:22.961
Deacon?
- It's a sheep.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.879
A what?
- A sheep.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.632
Dear God!

24:27.299 --> 24:28.967
I don't know.
- Is that blood?

24:28.968 --> 24:31.095
Oh, these kids.

24:31.553 --> 24:33.145
Oh my God.

24:33.639 --> 24:37.689
Just keep breathing. It's okay...

24:39.269 --> 24:40.979
An incident.

24:40.980 --> 24:46.156
Well, someone killed an animal,
a sheep, outside our cottage.

24:46.235 --> 24:50.785
They set fire to it. They, they burnt
it. The poor creature was in agony.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.658
No, I didn't see the people who did it.

24:53.659 --> 24:57.629
It was kids, I think.
Kids from the village.

26:44.103 --> 26:47.823
Our Father who is in heaven,

26:48.524 --> 26:53.569
who has shown us this glorious
miracle in your house of worship.

26:53.570 --> 26:56.573
Please show yourself again!

26:56.657 --> 26:59.200
"Our father who art in heaven,"

26:59.201 --> 27:01.202
"hallowed by thy name."

27:01.203 --> 27:02.829
"Thy kingdom come."

27:02.830 --> 27:05.123
"Thy will be done, on
earth as it is in heaven."

27:05.124 --> 27:07.583
"Give us this day our daily bread."

27:07.584 --> 27:09.293
"And forgive us our trespasses,"

27:09.294 --> 27:11.504
"as we forgive those who
trespass against us."

27:11.505 --> 27:14.178
"And lead us not into temptation,"

27:14.758 --> 27:17.602
"but deliver us from evil."

27:35.028 --> 27:37.997
You still up?
- Yeah, can't sleep.

27:40.284 --> 27:42.536
You gonna wear that thing to bed?

27:43.120 --> 27:45.418
No, I'll stick it on charge in a minute.

27:50.794 --> 27:52.420
You alright, Deacon?

27:54.882 --> 27:56.382
Yeah.

27:57.718 --> 27:59.218
You?

27:59.636 --> 28:01.137
Yeah, I'm alright...

28:02.097 --> 28:04.432
What are you reading?
- What's this?

28:04.433 --> 28:10.229
It's a journal from Dr. Pritchard
Mandeville. Now he was the last

28:10.230 --> 28:13.941
minister of the church before
it closed around 1880.

28:13.942 --> 28:18.654
Apparently the Lord came to him in these
dreams and called him here and told him

28:18.655 --> 28:22.074
to open an orphanage nearby.

28:22.075 --> 28:23.575
Let's have a look.

28:29.583 --> 28:34.304
"A curious town,
none too pleasant for it."

28:35.005 --> 28:40.953
"The locals are a solemn bunch
and the skies are leaden grey."

28:41.011 --> 28:43.388
Well, I know how he feels.

28:44.306 --> 28:47.047
You know, I thought I was gonna
get sent home earlier on.

28:47.768 --> 28:51.687
Listen, I wouldn't worry about it. Mark
just likes to do things by the book.

28:51.688 --> 28:56.442
He's probably not best pleased that one
of the team members isn't even religious.

28:56.443 --> 29:01.449
Hey, I believe in stuff, just
not as much as you two.

29:02.032 --> 29:04.705
Yeah, well, he'll come round.

29:05.953 --> 29:07.579
Or you will.

29:07.746 --> 29:11.045
Father Crellick, nice to meet you at last.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.960
You do look a little tired, Father
Crellick. Are you alright?

29:13.961 --> 29:19.382
You know, it wouldn't do any harm
if you went away for a day or two,

29:19.383 --> 29:23.135
think about something else.
We will be very thorough,

29:23.136 --> 29:24.808
I assure you.

29:25.097 --> 29:28.146
We will need full access to the church.

29:29.226 --> 29:30.773
Of course.

29:31.895 --> 29:33.738
The keys to the kingdom.

29:38.318 --> 29:41.492
Father Crellick has left the site.

29:42.197 --> 29:44.574
Now we're going to examine the altar.

29:45.909 --> 29:51.668
Church built around 1260. It's a small
parish enclave on top of a hill.

29:54.042 --> 29:56.419
And here's the crucifix.

29:56.920 --> 30:00.089
Solid enough, nothing hidden underneath.

30:00.090 --> 30:03.059
Yeah, it might not be the same
one. Could be a duplicate.

30:03.677 --> 30:09.855
Note: Must cross check crucifix
against video footage.

30:10.434 --> 30:12.652
Are you mental? I mean,

30:13.687 --> 30:17.737
Crellick was standing here, right?
And he was holding a baby.

30:19.359 --> 30:23.904
How's he gonna move all that lot?
- You mean, how did he move all that lot?

30:23.905 --> 30:27.325
I can't believe you two
are so sure it was him.

30:27.326 --> 30:28.826
Hang on.

30:29.536 --> 30:31.709
Yep, I've got an idea.

30:32.748 --> 30:34.248
There you go.

30:34.499 --> 30:37.835
Ah, there it is. - What?
- See it? - No.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.588
Wind the tape back.

30:40.547 --> 30:42.299
Right, watch it again.

30:45.093 --> 30:47.095
Look at the altar table.

30:48.221 --> 30:51.390
The water, it's vibrating.

30:51.391 --> 30:55.394
Exactly! A speaker under
the altar would do that.

30:55.395 --> 30:59.190
And there's definitely some fixture
holding something under there.

30:59.191 --> 31:01.534
What, like a subwoofer?
- Yeah.

31:02.110 --> 31:07.573
You saw the size of his congregation?
This is his chance for notoriety.

31:07.574 --> 31:09.784
You know,
headline in the local newspaper,

31:09.785 --> 31:11.243
maybe a bit in the evening news.

31:11.244 --> 31:14.497
People will start flocking back in,
and even if eventually the Vatican

31:14.498 --> 31:19.001
doesn't recognize the miracle -
well, by then the coffers are full.

31:19.002 --> 31:21.962
Yeah, some of these people think
they are doing the church a favour,

31:21.963 --> 31:25.967
when in reality all they are doing is
dragging us back to the dark ages.

31:27.219 --> 31:30.096
Right, we're going to set up
a grid to cover the space.

31:30.097 --> 31:33.057
You take the left transcept,
I'll take the right.

31:33.058 --> 31:34.475
Hang on, what are we looking for?

31:34.476 --> 31:37.728
Well, anything that doesn't fit.
You know, recent repairs,

31:37.729 --> 31:40.356
wires in the wall. Just something
that doesn't look right.

31:40.357 --> 31:41.982
You are thinking hidden speakers,
like in...

31:41.983 --> 31:43.530
Yes.

31:43.944 --> 31:48.244
That's better across there, like that.
- Alright? Sweet.

31:55.997 --> 31:58.332
What's that?
- What, this?

31:58.333 --> 32:02.086
It's for detecting magnetic fields. It can
pick up any hidden speakers in the walls

32:02.087 --> 32:05.181
larger than like a pair of earbuds.

32:05.215 --> 32:08.184
Earbuds?
- Yeah, headphones, Mark.

32:33.869 --> 32:36.042
Are you two making that noise?

32:36.538 --> 32:39.587
Are you scraping off paint?
- Eh?

32:42.043 --> 32:43.715
Not me, dude.

33:20.874 --> 33:23.672
I got you, Deacon, I got you!

33:27.881 --> 33:32.426
No, Deacon's alright when you get to
know him. I mean, he seems on top of it

33:32.427 --> 33:35.930
if you ask me. He's... Yeah,
alright, he likes a drink.

33:35.931 --> 33:39.981
But I mean, he's just having a sip of
the communion wine, so it's all kosher.

33:41.686 --> 33:44.188
Look, booze just relaxes him.

33:44.940 --> 33:48.785
Well, I mean, priests are an uptight
bunch and he's got a lot on his mind.

33:49.069 --> 33:54.793
That Crellick, he's a few
rosaries short of a crucifix.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.367
Hello?

33:59.788 --> 34:01.288
Hello?

34:02.707 --> 34:04.675
Fucking dog bollocks.

34:14.844 --> 34:16.344
There it is again.

34:17.054 --> 34:19.023
Is that one of you two?

34:19.349 --> 34:21.817
What?
- Shhh, listen!

34:30.360 --> 34:31.860
Gray?

34:35.657 --> 34:40.253
Here lies the body of
Samuel Shortage, aged 62.

34:40.911 --> 34:43.380
Not a bad innings, I suppose.

35:09.065 --> 35:13.945
It seems... to

35:14.195 --> 35:16.072
be coming from over there.

35:18.992 --> 35:25.067
"Wrapped up in linen. All wrapped
up in linen and cold as clay."

35:27.167 --> 35:32.941
"So beat the drum slowly
and play the fife lowly."

35:37.093 --> 35:38.845
What the fuck...

35:57.614 --> 35:59.787
That's fucking weird.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.292
What the fuck...

36:07.624 --> 36:10.968
Oh fucking hell, fucking hell...

36:12.879 --> 36:14.379
What is that?

36:15.090 --> 36:16.590
Gray!

36:18.968 --> 36:21.011
That sodding dog!
- Where?

36:21.012 --> 36:24.061
I dunno, I think he ran off.

36:26.101 --> 36:27.351
Up you come.

36:27.352 --> 36:31.447
I honestly thought some five year
old girl must have broken her leg.

37:02.971 --> 37:05.681
I don't know what kind. It was a big one.
- What, like a dachshund?

37:05.682 --> 37:08.642
It wasn't a dachshund. It was like the
hound of the fucking Baskervillesl

37:08.643 --> 37:09.935
Mark!

37:09.936 --> 37:12.312
Mark! Don't move, Mark.
Open your eyes!

37:12.313 --> 37:13.856
He's got blood in his ear.
- Right.

37:13.857 --> 37:15.983
Gray, take him outside, sit him down

37:15.984 --> 37:19.737
and stay with him. Stay with him!
- All I need is a little air.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.706
You look peaky, Mark.

37:25.452 --> 37:26.577
Mark!
- What?

37:26.578 --> 37:28.328
Why don't you go and see a doctor?

37:28.329 --> 37:31.165
It's just an in-ear thing. I
must have ruptured my

37:31.166 --> 37:33.375
ear drum on the flight. It happens...

37:33.376 --> 37:37.421
No, I heard it too. It was like this
weird rasping, scratchy noise,

37:37.422 --> 37:40.674
a bit like that.
- Okay, okay, it was rats.

37:40.675 --> 37:42.509
Hardly unusual in an old building.

37:42.510 --> 37:46.230
Can I just go on the
record please and say

37:47.015 --> 37:49.808
that Mark should go and see a doctor!

37:49.809 --> 37:53.904
Right, I'm going to bed.
I need to write up my report.

37:58.902 --> 38:02.654
Deacon - I mean what is he, a
Christian or a Christian scientist?

38:02.655 --> 38:06.366
So Gray, how did you come to be
working for the congregation?

38:06.367 --> 38:09.661
I saw it on a tech recruitment website.

38:09.662 --> 38:13.086
Sounded cool, money was good.

38:14.459 --> 38:18.304
They did ask me if I was a believer.

38:18.379 --> 38:20.631
And I said: "yeah".

38:20.632 --> 38:22.133
You lied.

38:22.884 --> 38:24.384
Well...

38:24.969 --> 38:26.891
You know, I wasn't

38:27.972 --> 38:29.894
brought up religious.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.809
But you know,

38:33.311 --> 38:37.816
I believe in... stuff.
I mean today, right,

38:38.358 --> 38:40.030
in the church -

38:41.986 --> 38:45.660
didn't you feel... something?

38:46.825 --> 38:50.078
A presence?
- Well,

38:51.621 --> 38:53.543
it is a church.

38:57.210 --> 38:59.428
I'll get you a beer.
- Okay.

39:04.425 --> 39:05.843
Deacon!

39:05.844 --> 39:08.095
Yes?
- What happened in Belém?

39:08.096 --> 39:09.688
No.

39:09.764 --> 39:13.100
Dude, I'm gonna keep hassling
you if you don't tell me, okay?

39:13.101 --> 39:17.356
I'm gonna badger you if you
don't tell me. Cough it!

39:25.530 --> 39:28.699
Belém. Bethlehem in English.
- Right.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.742
It's a town in Northern Brazil.

39:30.743 --> 39:36.124
Well, there was a shrine there that was
getting a reputation as a new Lourdes.

39:36.583 --> 39:40.544
Cardinal Prefect Renaldi himself
led the investigation.

39:40.545 --> 39:44.006
When they arrived they were
amazed. There was a queue of sick

39:44.007 --> 39:47.306
people outside the shrine
waiting to be healed.

39:47.343 --> 39:48.843
And...

39:49.804 --> 39:51.889
did they see anyone get healed?

39:51.890 --> 39:53.390
Better.

39:55.810 --> 39:57.687
They saw God.

39:58.813 --> 40:00.360
Right.

40:01.149 --> 40:05.068
Now we started getting really
confused reports from Renaldi...

40:05.069 --> 40:07.537
which barely made any sense.

40:07.822 --> 40:12.034
And then... Then they disappeared.

40:12.035 --> 40:13.661
Renaldi?

40:14.120 --> 40:19.374
Yeah, Renaldi. The Vatican, they went
crazy. It's like a high ranking cardinal

40:19.375 --> 40:21.877
and his team had just vanished.

40:24.213 --> 40:29.014
Their bodies turned up in the
jungle a few days later.

40:31.262 --> 40:34.431
So what happened?
- The autopsy reports revealed

40:34.432 --> 40:39.436
"atypical chemical traces".
- So what does that mean?

40:39.437 --> 40:45.162
They what - they got poisoned?
- My guess: Dimethyltryptamine, D.M.T..

40:46.986 --> 40:50.322
Powerful hallucinogenic, plant-
derived. The shamans there

40:50.323 --> 40:54.618
have been using it for millennia. Maybe
the priests had a bad reaction to it

40:54.619 --> 40:58.794
and the locals panicked
and dumped the bodies.

40:58.957 --> 41:04.957
Or... maybe... they actually saw God.

41:11.594 --> 41:14.179
Hold up your beer bottle.
No, no, side on.

41:14.180 --> 41:17.391
Let me show you. There,
hold it up like that.

41:17.392 --> 41:18.684
That's it, put your hand
on top like that.

41:18.685 --> 41:21.061
Alright?
- Perfect. Now are you watching?

41:21.062 --> 41:22.562
Here we go.

41:25.108 --> 41:26.608
Dude...

41:26.651 --> 41:28.151
Yeah...

41:29.320 --> 41:32.289
Don't believe everything you see, Gray.

41:33.157 --> 41:34.657
Good night.

41:40.164 --> 41:42.041
What the fuck...

41:46.838 --> 41:50.512
Father, give me the
strength to resist evil.

41:50.842 --> 41:56.770
Please protect this house and
prevent evil from entering.

41:57.557 --> 42:03.063
I need your strength, and the
strength of your Son, Jesus Christ.

42:07.734 --> 42:13.715
Strengthen my faith and
sacrifice this holy place...

42:23.583 --> 42:26.131
Please let me be strong...

43:03.539 --> 43:08.510
Strengthen my power and
my faith for this ordeal...

43:19.305 --> 43:24.601
"More cages. Sick to my core.
The dreams drew me here."

43:24.602 --> 43:30.655
"Perhaps always him. I beseech
you reader, leave this place!"

43:30.858 --> 43:34.612
"This village, a painted facade."

43:35.363 --> 43:39.288
"He lies beneath
ever hungrier for souls."

43:40.076 --> 43:45.205
And this bit: "Now I see the
perfect hideous logic"

43:45.206 --> 43:47.253
"of the orphanage."

43:47.875 --> 43:50.293
"I may have a new master now."

43:50.294 --> 43:53.673
And that's it. That's
the last thing he wrote.

43:56.300 --> 44:01.429
Does any of that mean anything to you?
- No. No, but I'll tell you something:

44:01.430 --> 44:04.474
I don't think it's an accident
that Mandeville's journal

44:04.475 --> 44:07.727
ended up in the church records.
I think Crellick put it there.

44:07.728 --> 44:11.857
I think he wanted us to find it because we
would read it and understand something.

44:11.858 --> 44:16.363
Something that Crellick couldn't
or wouldn't tell us.

44:17.321 --> 44:21.166
But what that is I've no idea.

44:22.994 --> 44:26.088
Right, come on, Mark. Let's go!

44:28.833 --> 44:30.425
Mark?

44:35.506 --> 44:37.006
Mark?

44:40.428 --> 44:41.928
Mark?

44:45.766 --> 44:47.734
Deacon, look at his ear.

44:48.060 --> 44:51.313
Mark.
Mark!

44:57.320 --> 45:01.620
Listen, we'll just let him sleep it off.
The walk will do him good.

45:03.784 --> 45:06.878
Please leave me.

45:09.040 --> 45:10.837
It's open.

45:20.176 --> 45:22.260
I heard the voices again last night.

45:22.261 --> 45:23.933
Father Crellick!

45:26.641 --> 45:28.393
Did you sleep here?

45:33.356 --> 45:36.608
Were those voices coming from
over here, Father Crellick?

45:36.609 --> 45:39.908
Looks like those kids have
played a wee trick on you.

45:41.155 --> 45:42.572
You think I'm a fool, don't you?

45:42.573 --> 45:47.911
We want this to be a miracle
just as much as you do, dude.

45:47.912 --> 45:50.631
No, you don't.

45:52.708 --> 45:54.710
I'm not like Mandeville.

45:57.755 --> 46:02.300
If there is anything in this
church this will help us find it.

46:02.301 --> 46:07.764
I mean, if a poltergeist farted in here
six months ago we will hear it.

46:07.765 --> 46:13.765
This is ghost hunting equipment, is it?
- Well, okay. You know how you said

46:13.938 --> 46:15.313
that when you heard the sound

46:15.314 --> 46:17.524
it seemed to move?
- Yeah.

46:17.525 --> 46:19.025
Well,

46:19.402 --> 46:24.328
these are radio mics and they've
got an analogue receiver.

46:24.782 --> 46:30.662
It's got dials, okay? That means you
can tune between frequencies.

46:30.663 --> 46:32.664
And that's good?

46:32.665 --> 46:35.008
It's where stuff hides.

46:35.293 --> 46:37.170
Where did you hear the sound?

46:37.253 --> 46:39.462
Huh?
- Where did you hear the sound?

46:39.463 --> 46:41.589
Well, it was there and then
it moved over to there.

46:41.590 --> 46:44.843
Okay. We put one mic here, in the pulpit.

46:44.844 --> 46:48.388
We put one mic over here, let's
say in the middle of these books.

46:48.389 --> 46:53.143
We put one mic somewhere
here, on the high altar.

46:53.144 --> 46:56.563
And then you can tune in-
between the three of them?

46:56.564 --> 46:58.440
We can then tune between all three,

46:58.441 --> 47:02.360
we can hear three dimensionally
what's going on in this space.

47:02.361 --> 47:04.904
And we can put some further around here?

47:04.905 --> 47:07.741
We've got 12 in total. Pick your spots.

47:07.742 --> 47:09.159
Okay.

47:09.160 --> 47:13.005
Mic check. Mic one, check.

47:13.039 --> 47:15.332
Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

47:15.333 --> 47:17.792
No, I mean you can hear me, but
can you hear it on the receiver?

47:17.793 --> 47:19.794
Oh, sorry.
- Tune it round to 100.

47:19.795 --> 47:21.968
On the dial, the big dial.

47:23.883 --> 47:25.976
Cool.

47:28.637 --> 47:31.639
Yeah, that will be good, that's where
Mark had his fall, wasn't it?

47:31.640 --> 47:35.269
It's dirty work down here, mate.

47:36.145 --> 47:41.993
Right, mic two, check.
- Mic two, check!

47:44.528 --> 47:46.701
Mic seven, check.

47:47.198 --> 47:50.622
Yeah, hearing it. Mic seven, roger.

48:02.213 --> 48:04.590
Dude, listen.

48:04.632 --> 48:06.132
Listen.

48:12.056 --> 48:13.933
Let me get a hold on that.

48:16.060 --> 48:17.903
Alright, that's...

48:18.813 --> 48:20.647
No, that's mic two.

48:20.648 --> 48:22.445
Is it moving?

48:25.945 --> 48:27.697
Dude, what is that?

48:29.031 --> 48:31.199
It's moving,
it's moving along this wall.

48:31.200 --> 48:34.874
Now what?
- Now it's going towards the bookcase.

48:35.955 --> 48:37.502
Just there.

48:37.540 --> 48:39.383
That's right there, dude.

48:42.253 --> 48:45.723
What is that - an animal?

48:46.549 --> 48:48.551
Is that a voice?

48:53.556 --> 48:56.024
No, it's gone.

48:58.227 --> 48:59.979
It's totally gone.

49:00.438 --> 49:03.231
You've checked all this for
speakers, haven't you?

49:03.232 --> 49:05.609
Dude, it was along this wall here.

49:06.735 --> 49:08.703
It moved along here.

49:08.737 --> 49:11.114
And you've checked that for speakers?

49:22.918 --> 49:25.011
There is nothing in there, dude?

49:29.008 --> 49:31.385
Hi Mark, you feeling better?

49:33.345 --> 49:34.971
I'm fine.

49:44.815 --> 49:48.693
It's definitely over here.
- That's between mics three and four.

49:48.694 --> 49:50.571
Right.
- Hold on.

49:51.322 --> 49:53.449
Heading towards mic three.

50:00.873 --> 50:02.374
Listen.

50:07.213 --> 50:13.263
12:05h, sound of infant crying. Most likely
interference from a nearby baby monitor.

50:17.014 --> 50:19.391
Gray, Gray!

50:24.438 --> 50:25.939
Dude.

50:41.247 --> 50:42.747
What's going on?

50:43.624 --> 50:48.169
That was Father Crellick, I just saw him
skulking about in the window over there.

50:48.170 --> 50:50.964
I knew it was too good to be true.
Something tangible happens

50:50.965 --> 50:52.757
and he just so happens to be there.

50:52.758 --> 50:55.969
Dude, we've checked for subwoofers
and didn't find any.

50:55.970 --> 50:59.098
How's he gonna...?
- Maybe he went basic.

50:59.348 --> 51:01.099
Loop of fishing line, out the loop

51:01.100 --> 51:03.851
and then whip it away again.
- That's bullshit, it's too involved.

51:03.852 --> 51:06.646
He didn't even seem with it.

51:06.647 --> 51:09.190
Gray, you don't know that.
- I know it doesn't feel nice

51:09.191 --> 51:13.412
to be deceived. I'm going to
follow him, see what he's up to.

51:13.529 --> 51:15.827
This might be us finished.

51:44.310 --> 51:45.902
Father Crellick?

51:59.325 --> 52:02.827
I've got to say it pains me to say it but
Mark's theory about that baby monitor

52:02.828 --> 52:05.622
is probably correct. It's
the best explanation.

52:05.623 --> 52:09.751
No, dude. I switched this off.

52:09.752 --> 52:11.252
What?

52:11.837 --> 52:15.432
Dude, the machine is switched off!

52:20.512 --> 52:23.515
Father? Are you there?

52:24.183 --> 52:25.809
Father Crellick?

52:43.327 --> 52:44.953
Father Crellick?

52:45.871 --> 52:50.717
You don't believe in my miracle,
do you? I prayed for you to come.

52:52.795 --> 52:56.720
If this is not a miracle, if this
is not the hand of God...

53:02.429 --> 53:06.479
I can hear it! Where's it coming from?

53:08.477 --> 53:10.604
Fuck, dude!
- What?

53:11.313 --> 53:13.481
Calm down. I'm not your enemy here.

53:13.482 --> 53:15.905
But if this isn't a miracle...

53:17.236 --> 53:18.569
Get out of here!

53:18.570 --> 53:21.243
Father Crellick...
Oh Christ!

53:23.450 --> 53:29.298
Deacon! Gray!
- We're coming! What's going on?

53:29.331 --> 53:32.505
Mark, Mark! Where are you?

53:34.545 --> 53:36.547
Fuck! Guys!

53:37.339 --> 53:41.184
Oh fuck! Oh God! Oh fuck! Oh fuck!

53:45.097 --> 53:47.816
Oh fuck!
- Father Crellick.

53:49.101 --> 53:54.357
"Christ almighty and his holy mercy,
may the Lord Father assist you."

54:40.444 --> 54:45.239
The... the police are with Mark
now. I wouldn't worry,

54:45.240 --> 54:48.118
he can be quite the salesman
when he wants to be.

54:49.578 --> 54:52.206
I just don't understand it, Deacon.

54:52.456 --> 54:54.424
What don't you understand?

54:56.043 --> 54:57.544
Crellick.

54:59.505 --> 55:03.716
That's a sin, right? According to you lot.
- A mortal sin.

55:03.717 --> 55:05.343
A mortal sin.

55:07.179 --> 55:11.775
The souls of those who die in a state
of mortal sin descend into hell.

55:13.268 --> 55:14.940
Into hell.

55:16.438 --> 55:19.908
But... Crellick was a priest.

55:22.820 --> 55:24.993
Priests can be sinners too.

55:31.578 --> 55:34.172
Come on, I'm buying.

55:48.428 --> 55:50.054
Oh, here we go.

55:57.646 --> 55:59.898
Just keep walking, Deacon.

56:00.023 --> 56:01.524
Dude...

56:07.990 --> 56:10.157
Not so funny now, is it?

56:10.158 --> 56:12.581
Is it?
- He's bleeding!

56:15.581 --> 56:17.628
Dude, that was unnecessary.

56:17.749 --> 56:21.093
Deacon! They're just kids, mate.

56:27.175 --> 56:28.675
Cheers, love.

56:31.388 --> 56:33.435
Take it easy.
- Another one, please!

56:35.893 --> 56:38.441
Just don't tell Mark, okay?

56:39.104 --> 56:42.523
Holy people struggle too, you
know? Open a newspaper,

56:42.524 --> 56:44.734
we all make bad choices,
same as everyone else.

56:44.735 --> 56:48.159
Yeah well, jumping off a church tower
sounds like the wrong choice.

56:48.864 --> 56:51.116
He was under a lot of pressure.

56:54.328 --> 56:55.829
Pressure?

56:56.747 --> 57:02.504
But Deacon. Mark might want to hide
his head in the sand, but you...

57:03.587 --> 57:06.631
You know better, I know you do.
What we saw up there...

57:06.632 --> 57:08.716
Two more, please.
- Deacon, what we saw up there

57:08.717 --> 57:12.391
was not normal. It was not
fucking normal, mate.

57:12.679 --> 57:14.847
The people that came before
you lot, right...

57:14.848 --> 57:17.725
The pagans.
- Yeah alright, the pagans,

57:17.726 --> 57:20.019
druids, the Aztecs or whatever.

57:20.020 --> 57:23.856
They believed in stuff that was real.
You know, they had the moon,

57:23.857 --> 57:27.944
the sea, the stars, the sun. They
had stuff, they worshipped stuff!

57:27.945 --> 57:31.530
They didn't know any better. They were just
worshipping what was in front of them.

57:31.531 --> 57:35.368
No, they worshipped what
was there, physically there.

57:35.369 --> 57:38.998
Whereas you are choosing
to believe and worship

57:40.540 --> 57:42.792
the great "what if".

57:44.294 --> 57:47.047
And your point is?
- Well, my point is...

57:48.465 --> 57:51.509
My point is, that if there
was gonna be a fight

57:51.510 --> 57:57.510
between something that was there
and something which wasn't there,

57:59.810 --> 58:02.187
then I know which side I'd bet on.

58:03.563 --> 58:05.815
What? Are you...

58:07.150 --> 58:09.151
What?
- Hey, can we get some drinks here, please?

58:09.152 --> 58:12.576
Don't make a face, Deacon.
- Bar's closed.

58:13.657 --> 58:17.493
Come on, it's just after nine.
- My pub, my rules.

58:17.494 --> 58:20.788
Ah, come on, don't be ridiculous!
- You just served this guy.

58:20.789 --> 58:22.962
A man is dead.

58:23.875 --> 58:25.627
A good man.

58:26.378 --> 58:30.223
I know his mum, you should
see the state of her.

58:31.383 --> 58:33.551
Yeah, we don't want any trouble, lads.

58:33.552 --> 58:35.636
The only people causing trouble
around here are you.

58:35.637 --> 58:37.638
Look... Deacon, hey, dude, dude, dude!

58:37.639 --> 58:41.517
No! Dude, dude, dude!
- We were asked here.

58:41.518 --> 58:44.396
We came here to help!
- Help?

58:44.813 --> 58:46.360
Dude, let's go!

58:48.608 --> 58:52.203
Deacon, come on, dude!
- I've been there before, Gray.

58:52.946 --> 58:55.364
Everyone's trying to sweep
the truth under the carpet.

58:55.365 --> 58:57.617
I'm not gonna let it happen again.

58:59.327 --> 59:01.295
We've got to go back up there.

59:12.883 --> 59:16.637
Where have you been?
- Listen, Mark, mate,

59:16.678 --> 59:19.555
we had a thought about where
the sounds were coming from.

59:19.556 --> 59:22.058
So we went to investigate...
- Investigation's over.

59:22.059 --> 59:25.561
You can go and pack away your stuff.
I've sent in a revised report,

59:25.562 --> 59:27.563
all we're doing is waiting
on the movement order.

59:27.564 --> 59:30.733
Mark, come on, mate...
- This is not over!

59:30.734 --> 59:34.361
Really? Well, if you can tell me
which one of the awful events

59:34.362 --> 59:37.323
we witnessed constitutes a miracle, I will
be sure to inform my undersecretary.

59:37.324 --> 59:39.867
But...
- There is nothing going on at that church

59:39.868 --> 59:43.537
but a depressed priest with misguided
notions and now he's dead.

59:43.538 --> 59:45.122
If you still think it's Crellick

59:45.123 --> 59:47.750
then why don't we go back up
there? If nothing happens,

59:47.751 --> 59:50.879
then we will know for sure!
- A priest is dead!

59:51.463 --> 59:55.763
I am not going to let this turn
into another campfire story.

01:00:13.485 --> 01:00:17.655
It's right there! We get in there and
we... I told him there's something there!

01:00:17.656 --> 01:00:21.035
Now we've got it in our
grasp and he wants to go.

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:43.496
"Waiting by the quayside..."

01:00:50.063 --> 01:00:55.820
"...in your home, boy. Let her go."

01:01:01.408 --> 01:01:04.331
"Go, boy..."

01:01:07.414 --> 01:01:09.336
Shit!

01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:24.480
Hello? Hello?

01:01:50.415 --> 01:01:51.916
Who's there?

01:01:54.461 --> 01:01:56.213
Father Crellick?

01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:25.624
Deacon.

01:02:29.246 --> 01:02:31.919
Deacon.

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:46.513
Father Crellick?

01:02:52.102 --> 01:02:53.945
What's that?

01:03:07.867 --> 01:03:12.338
Jesus Christ. Sick bastards.

01:03:59.210 --> 01:04:02.554
Oh shit, shit!

01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:07.598
Deacon, what are you playing at?

01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:18.603
What?

01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:25.369
Who said that?

01:04:38.917 --> 01:04:40.634
Oh my God.

01:04:42.087 --> 01:04:43.759
My God.

01:04:50.261 --> 01:04:52.058
Where's it coming from?

01:04:55.683 --> 01:04:57.480
What is that?

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:53.707
Who's there? Who's there?

01:06:12.844 --> 01:06:19.147
<i>Frazzetti. Frazzetti's eyes..
Oh God, his eyes!</i>

01:07:29.087 --> 01:07:30.969
As if we didn't have enough on.

01:07:30.970 --> 01:07:32.714
We should be on our way
to Liege right now.

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:37.219
The situation is not resolved.
- It was according to my report.

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:39.638
Reconsecration is a matter
for the local diocese.

01:07:39.639 --> 01:07:40.889
Why are you ignoring what happened?

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:43.267
What I found?
- What, some old animal bones

01:07:43.268 --> 01:07:46.562
and you imagined you heard something.
- Which warrants further investigation!

01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:49.147
It wasn't your call to make.
- Yeah, well, somebody had to!

01:07:49.148 --> 01:07:52.234
Well, somebody is going to be facing
serious disciplinary procedures

01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:53.902
when this is over.
- Right.

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:57.072
This is your last mission with
the congregation, Deacon.

01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:59.325
I'll make bloody sure of that.

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:15.299
Father Umberto Calvino,
he was my tutor.

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:19.094
He heads up the Vatican archives
now, all very hush hush.

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:22.439
You don't have to tell me, dude.
I've read "The Da Vinci Code".

01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:25.934
Grazie.
- Father Calvinol

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:28.687
Very nice flight,
I enjoyed that.

01:08:28.688 --> 01:08:31.564
Calvino's an expert in church
history. All the stuff

01:08:31.566 --> 01:08:33.692
that's been swept under the holy carpet.

01:08:33.693 --> 01:08:35.193
Right.

01:08:35.291 --> 01:08:37.194
They've been trying to
get rid of him for years,

01:08:37.196 --> 01:08:42.075
but when this kind of thing comes along,
- He's a useful man to have in your corner.

01:08:42.076 --> 01:08:43.747
The best.

01:08:43.911 --> 01:08:47.335
Padre Deacon!
- Padre Calvino!

01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:49.671
Grazie.

01:08:52.337 --> 01:08:55.631
So Padre, looking at all the
information, both the event

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:57.549
and the timeline, most of it is audio -

01:08:57.550 --> 01:09:00.510
although there is some physical,
if we include the moving cross.

01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:03.180
Why are you suddenly including that now?
- Well, in the light of the new

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:05.640
circumstances, the new evidences...
- What new evidences?

01:09:05.642 --> 01:09:09.442
You haven't found anything!
- He knew about Frazzetti!

01:09:11.272 --> 01:09:17.649
<i>Frazzetti. Frazzetti's eyes..
Oh God, his eyes!</i>

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:22.616
You could have been saying those
things, we never see your face.

01:09:22.617 --> 01:09:28.575
Oh really? What, in Crellick's accent?
Why would I want to mention Frazzetti?

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:32.417
Guys, who is Frazzetti?

01:09:34.045 --> 01:09:39.466
He worked for the congregation. He was
in Belem. He was second in command,

01:09:39.466 --> 01:09:41.264
under Deacon.

01:09:41.678 --> 01:09:46.014
Wait - Deacon was in Belém?
- Gray...

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:47.683
Deacon likes to edit the story

01:09:47.684 --> 01:09:49.725
to make him less culpable.

01:09:49.727 --> 01:09:54.398
When he got there each and every
one of the priests was still alive.

01:09:54.399 --> 01:09:57.152
All he had to do was bring them home,

01:09:57.485 --> 01:09:59.986
but he couldn't resist meddling.
The scammers thought

01:09:59.987 --> 01:10:04.583
they'd been discovered and murdered
each and every one of them.

01:10:04.617 --> 01:10:07.961
Would have murdered Deacon too
if he wasn't drunk that night.

01:10:10.164 --> 01:10:14.919
Alright, but "Frazzetti's eyes" -

01:10:15.086 --> 01:10:16.883
what does that mean?

01:10:18.339 --> 01:10:24.498
During the visions, Frazzetti was unable
to deal with what he was seeing.

01:10:27.932 --> 01:10:30.767
He cut his own eyes out.

01:10:30.768 --> 01:10:34.771
Look, okay fine, I will see this through,
okay, but then I am done!

01:10:34.772 --> 01:10:38.993
I'm going back to corporates.
It's boring but it's a lot less grief!

01:10:39.277 --> 01:10:43.155
Because Deacon has been lying to me
and because you've been lying to me.

01:10:43.156 --> 01:10:46.580
I mean, do any of you people
tell the fucking truth?

01:10:46.701 --> 01:10:48.744
I don't give a monkey's about the bonus!

01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:51.788
You can give that to
the fucking poor or something!

01:10:51.789 --> 01:10:54.666
You know what? Dan Brown
was right about you lot!

01:10:54.667 --> 01:10:58.546
You can stick your hail Marys
up your fucking arse!

01:10:58.755 --> 01:11:02.680
Oh, he's gone. Oh well, ciao Signore.

01:11:18.441 --> 01:11:21.194
So Father Amidon.

01:11:21.694 --> 01:11:26.865
Relator General, no less. I always
knew you would rise far.

01:11:26.866 --> 01:11:30.619
I don't want you to think that I
resent your presence here but

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:33.839
Deacon had no authority
to make that call.

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:37.918
I still don't understand why you
would want to travel all this way.

01:11:37.919 --> 01:11:43.550
He may be insubordinate but
he may also be correct.

01:11:45.009 --> 01:11:48.553
Do you know of Pope Gregory's
letter to Mellitus?

01:11:48.554 --> 01:11:51.890
Mellitus? He was sent by Gregory
on a mission

01:11:51.891 --> 01:11:56.441
to bring Christianity to
the pagans of England.

01:11:56.521 --> 01:12:02.354
Gregory wrote: "By no means destroy
the temples of the heathen gods"

01:12:02.819 --> 01:12:06.863
"but rather the idols that
are within those temples."

01:12:06.864 --> 01:12:11.493
"When you have purified them with
holy water, place altars there."

01:12:11.494 --> 01:12:14.955
You're saying the church
used to be a pagan temple?

01:12:14.956 --> 01:12:18.255
No, no, not the building.

01:12:19.085 --> 01:12:21.178
But the ground.

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:27.884
This site has always been a site of
significance. What is present at this place

01:12:27.885 --> 01:12:30.638
is older than the church,

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:35.442
older than Christianity.
- So what is it,

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:40.657
like an evil spirit? A demon?
- Two words for the same thing.

01:12:41.065 --> 01:12:46.319
Once people worshipped it as a god.
The Church came along and drove it out,

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:50.950
they called it the Antichrist.
It does not matter what we call it.

01:12:52.618 --> 01:12:55.246
But now it has returned,

01:12:55.705 --> 01:13:00.210
like weeds that creep through
an abandoned building.

01:13:07.717 --> 01:13:10.010
Do you know what the foundation
of friendship is, Deacon?

01:13:10.011 --> 01:13:11.511
Yes.

01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:15.023
It's trust, mate.
It's trust, alright?

01:13:15.975 --> 01:13:18.643
I know that...
- I have to sit there... I have to sit there

01:13:18.644 --> 01:13:20.812
listening to your stories, alright,

01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:22.731
and we're bonding,
I think we're bonding.

01:13:22.732 --> 01:13:24.691
There were reasons I didn't
tell you the truth.

01:13:24.692 --> 01:13:27.490
Yeah, well, it turns out
it's all bollocks!

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:30.990
We are near.

01:13:44.837 --> 01:13:49.674
Gray. Gray. It was a mistake.
- No, mate.

01:13:49.675 --> 01:13:53.053
A mistake is when you spill a drink
or drop your phone in the toilet.

01:13:53.054 --> 01:13:56.973
What you did was a lie, mate.
- Let's put this into perspective, okay?

01:13:56.974 --> 01:14:01.519
I didn't kill those men. But I was
warned and I ignored it.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:05.565
And seven priests died. I am
going to have to live with that

01:14:05.566 --> 01:14:07.568
for the rest of my life.

01:14:10.613 --> 01:14:12.114
Let's go.

01:14:34.387 --> 01:14:36.013
Can you feel that?

01:14:43.562 --> 01:14:45.439
I don't like this.

01:15:01.872 --> 01:15:04.290
Padre, I've seen this symbol before.

01:15:04.291 --> 01:15:06.918
Yes, in the pagan times many
different gods were

01:15:06.919 --> 01:15:09.763
worshipped in different regions.

01:15:09.839 --> 01:15:14.384
This symbol represents a deity
of the people who were here.

01:15:14.385 --> 01:15:16.182
Which deity?

01:15:16.595 --> 01:15:18.813
There is so much we don't know.

01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:24.278
Even the name of this pagan
god eludes us. But this symbol

01:15:24.729 --> 01:15:26.981
is all we need -

01:15:27.606 --> 01:15:30.154
for the banishment ceremony.

01:15:45.583 --> 01:15:48.962
This is ridiculous. This isn't
even a Christian ceremony.

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:55.050
For the very first time I have seen
things here I can't explain.

01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:57.844
"In vino veritas".
- Yeah, sure.

01:15:57.845 --> 01:16:02.807
Mark, Mark! What about the baby?
We both heard that

01:16:02.808 --> 01:16:06.686
and the radios were off.
- Ferric oxide.

01:16:06.687 --> 01:16:08.354
What?
- I read of caves in France

01:16:08.355 --> 01:16:11.357
where people heard sounds.
Turns out the walls

01:16:11.358 --> 01:16:14.736
of the caves were rich in
ferric oxide. When the walls

01:16:14.737 --> 01:16:18.323
resonated at the right frequency,
they gave out sounds

01:16:18.324 --> 01:16:21.743
like a primitive tape recorder.
- That's bullshit!

01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:24.621
Why is it after all you've seen

01:16:24.622 --> 01:16:28.666
you continue to cling to bizarre
and desperate theories?

01:16:28.667 --> 01:16:32.295
Desperate theories? It's scientific
reasoning what we do.

01:16:32.296 --> 01:16:37.097
Maybe so, but we're also
representatives of the church!

01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:42.597
Are you questioning my faith?
One question:

01:16:42.598 --> 01:16:45.892
Do you accept there are things
happening in this church,

01:16:45.893 --> 01:16:49.192
things beyond science?
- No!

01:16:49.313 --> 01:16:54.109
You know what, I'm a virtuous man.
I follow the teachings of Jesus.

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:57.862
But that's not enough, is it? I'm
supposed to believe in magic now,

01:16:57.863 --> 01:17:01.616
supposed to believe the world was created
in six days, believe in empty rituals.

01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:03.539
Well, I don't!

01:17:04.161 --> 01:17:05.495
And it's high time the Church

01:17:05.496 --> 01:17:10.092
got rid of these alienating
medieval superstitions.

01:17:20.094 --> 01:17:24.144
All that remains is the finishing ritual.

01:17:24.348 --> 01:17:30.730
"In nomine Patris et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti."

01:17:31.355 --> 01:17:34.825
"In nomine Patris et Filii..."

01:17:46.370 --> 01:17:49.293
<i>Get away!</i>
- Did you hear that?

01:17:49.707 --> 01:17:51.584
<i>Get away!</i>

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:56.422
Go back! Go back! I command you!

01:18:17.193 --> 01:18:20.697
Mark? Mark?

01:18:21.572 --> 01:18:25.576
Mark. Mark, can you hear me?
Are you okay?

01:18:26.452 --> 01:18:31.753
Gray, can you hear? Are you hurt?
- Where's Father Calvino?

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.047
Father Calvino!

01:18:38.047 --> 01:18:40.220
Father Calvino!

01:18:41.133 --> 01:18:45.604
Father! Father Calvino!

01:18:50.517 --> 01:18:54.021
Shit! Shit!

01:18:54.271 --> 01:18:56.814
Please, please!

01:18:56.815 --> 01:19:00.652
Come on, you fucker!
I'm not in this!

01:19:00.653 --> 01:19:03.702
Goddamn it!

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:09.660
Deacon?

01:19:19.171 --> 01:19:20.671
Deacon!

01:19:22.549 --> 01:19:24.049
Deacon!

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:43.944
Fuck...

01:19:56.458 --> 01:20:00.633
Deacon! -Jesus!
- Deacon! -Jesus!

01:20:00.879 --> 01:20:03.840
Shit!
- Oh God!

01:20:03.841 --> 01:20:06.384
Okay, Gray, come here. Now look at me!

01:20:06.385 --> 01:20:10.596
Now you need to calm down!
- Okay. Dude, have you seen Mark?

01:20:10.597 --> 01:20:12.724
Mark?
- Yeah.

01:20:12.975 --> 01:20:17.571
I think he wandered down here. He was there
one minute, then he was just fucking gone.

01:20:17.771 --> 01:20:20.319
I'm going to take the light away now.
- Okay.

01:20:22.985 --> 01:20:25.695
Stay right behind me.
- Let's just get the fuck out of here, man!

01:20:25.696 --> 01:20:29.907
Father Calvino!
- You said he came down here?

01:20:29.908 --> 01:20:32.410
I don't know. I think so.

01:20:33.579 --> 01:20:35.331
What the fuck is that?

01:20:37.333 --> 01:20:39.255
Right, right, right.

01:20:41.712 --> 01:20:46.012
What if it's not Calvino?
What if it's not Calvino?

01:20:46.342 --> 01:20:49.891
Padre! Padre?

01:20:52.056 --> 01:20:57.560
What's that?
- It's a signal relay, for the head cams.

01:20:57.561 --> 01:20:59.854
I can ping each unit with this.
- Is that good?

01:20:59.855 --> 01:21:02.435
It might be handy if we ever
want to get out of here.

01:21:03.275 --> 01:21:04.867
Let's go.

01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:08.368
There's more blood on the floor.

01:21:12.951 --> 01:21:14.451
What's that?

01:21:17.331 --> 01:21:20.004
It's... it's Calvino's.

01:21:21.126 --> 01:21:23.048
There's more blood, Gray.

01:21:24.963 --> 01:21:29.093
We should go back. We
should get a search party.

01:21:29.927 --> 01:21:32.771
No, I can find him myself.

01:21:35.265 --> 01:21:38.439
It's wrong down here, Deacon.

01:21:40.104 --> 01:21:45.110
It's just echoes. There are
no monsters, no devils.

01:21:47.236 --> 01:21:51.206
It's not real Gray, it's not real.

01:21:51.657 --> 01:21:53.157
Come on.

01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:03.506
Fuck... fuck!

01:22:06.422 --> 01:22:07.922
Okay.

01:22:15.305 --> 01:22:17.432
Dude, my ears have just popped!

01:22:17.433 --> 01:22:22.985
Yeah, I think we're going deep.
Deep into the hill.

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:35.250
What on earth...

01:22:36.118 --> 01:22:37.870
What is this?

01:22:43.459 --> 01:22:49.810
"Please God, save them and forgive
me. I have a new master now."

01:22:53.427 --> 01:22:57.306
It's Mandeville.
- What would Mandeville be doing down here?

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:00.433
Gray.

01:23:00.434 --> 01:23:02.902
What the fuck is down here, dude?

01:23:12.362 --> 01:23:15.156
Have you ever seen anything
like this before?

01:23:15.157 --> 01:23:16.657
Mark?

01:23:18.994 --> 01:23:22.122
Deacon. - Did you hear that?
- Mark?

01:23:22.456 --> 01:23:24.003
Mark?

01:23:26.168 --> 01:23:27.669
Mark?

01:23:29.046 --> 01:23:31.048
It's getting tighter.

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:37.391
Mark?

01:23:40.098 --> 01:23:41.598
Dude!

01:23:44.353 --> 01:23:47.732
What is this?
- Look at that!

01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:55.868
Looks like that was a sacrificial altar.

01:23:56.490 --> 01:23:58.412
Those cages...

01:23:58.742 --> 01:24:01.711
Fuck, Deacon.
- Dear God.

01:24:02.538 --> 01:24:04.415
They killed kids.

01:24:05.207 --> 01:24:07.584
Who could...
- Mandeville.

01:24:07.918 --> 01:24:11.513
The orphanage.
- Oh fuck.

01:24:12.005 --> 01:24:13.757
Dear God.

01:24:16.593 --> 01:24:18.766
Fuck, Deacon.

01:24:25.811 --> 01:24:27.311
Mark?

01:24:29.356 --> 01:24:31.984
Mark, is that you? Mark?

01:24:35.112 --> 01:24:37.614
It's okay, I can see him! Mark!

01:24:38.448 --> 01:24:41.451
Deacon! Deacon, wait!

01:24:42.744 --> 01:24:44.244
Mark!

01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:50.632
Just wait, I'm coming! It's me!
Mark! No, Mark, wait! Mark!

01:24:57.301 --> 01:25:02.227
Mark? Mark? Where are you? Mark?

01:25:03.849 --> 01:25:05.521
Deacon!

01:25:06.935 --> 01:25:09.395
Deacon!
- Gray!

01:25:09.396 --> 01:25:14.447
Hold on, hold on.
- Dude, help me!

01:25:15.193 --> 01:25:17.069
Get me the fuck out of here!
- Okay.

01:25:17.070 --> 01:25:22.076
Help me, Deacon!
- Alright, just wait a second. Okay, right!

01:25:23.452 --> 01:25:26.205
Gray, give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

01:25:27.623 --> 01:25:31.334
Just an inch at a time. That's it,

01:25:31.335 --> 01:25:37.118
come on. There you go,
come on. Come on!

01:25:38.717 --> 01:25:40.514
One more.

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:46.140
Right, come on. I saw
Mark, he's just ahead.

01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:49.235
Mark!
- Deacon, wait!

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:57.110
Mark.
Mark!

01:26:01.698 --> 01:26:04.246
Mark! Mark!

01:26:06.244 --> 01:26:07.744
Mark!

01:26:14.086 --> 01:26:15.586
Mark!

01:26:24.262 --> 01:26:26.981
Mark! Mark!

01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:35.774
Father Calvino.

01:26:36.733 --> 01:26:40.328
Father Calvino, it's Deacon.
We're just coming to get you!

01:26:47.285 --> 01:26:50.129
Careful, careful.

01:26:52.207 --> 01:26:54.175
It opens a bit here.

01:26:54.584 --> 01:26:56.381
Deacon.

01:26:57.671 --> 01:26:59.764
My prodigal pupil,

01:27:02.843 --> 01:27:07.179
Deacon.
- It's a bit... a bit tight in here.

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:08.680
You alright?

01:27:11.935 --> 01:27:13.769
Gray, are you there?
- I'm here, mate.

01:27:13.770 --> 01:27:15.270
Hang on!

01:27:18.483 --> 01:27:21.402
You alright?
- What is this place? It stinks in here!

01:27:21.403 --> 01:27:24.952
Just keep close, okay?
- Okay.

01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:30.661
Okay, stop. Stop, Gray!

01:27:30.662 --> 01:27:34.917
Stop. It's getting too tight in here.

01:27:35.292 --> 01:27:38.136
We'll have to go back.
- I'll turn around, man.

01:27:38.837 --> 01:27:41.886
Just back up. Back up.

01:27:43.508 --> 01:27:45.801
Just make your way back down!
- It's wet!

01:27:45.802 --> 01:27:47.970
Quick as you like.
- It's wet in here!

01:27:47.971 --> 01:27:51.140
Deacon, it's blocked this way!
- What?

01:27:51.141 --> 01:27:54.977
It's blocked at this end!
Oh God!

01:27:54.978 --> 01:27:59.940
Okay, okay, okay...
- It's moving! Deacon, it's moving!

01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:02.284
Dude, dig out!

01:28:03.111 --> 01:28:05.534
Dig, come on!

01:28:06.031 --> 01:28:07.908
Get away from me!

01:28:12.704 --> 01:28:17.458
What are we gonna do? Oh God!
- I don't know. I don't know!

01:28:17.459 --> 01:28:19.836
Oh God, it burns!

01:28:23.882 --> 01:28:27.226
It's burning! Oh God!

01:28:28.345 --> 01:28:31.189
You said it wasn't real!

01:28:34.476 --> 01:28:36.694
...said it wasn't real!

01:28:55.455 --> 01:29:01.335
Our Father, which art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

01:29:01.336 --> 01:29:05.215
Oh God! Oh God!
