WEBVTT

00:07.333 --> 00:09.291
[murmur of conversation]

00:09.375 --> 00:11.000
[trumpets playing fanfare]

00:16.208 --> 00:17.458
[door opens]

00:17.541 --> 00:21.583
[Mousesack] Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon,
do you think this a joke?

00:22.125 --> 00:23.750
-I said there'd be hell to pay…
-Mousesack.

00:23.833 --> 00:25.833
…if you weren't ready
by the sound of those trumpets.

00:25.916 --> 00:27.666
Did you think I was joking?

00:27.750 --> 00:31.291
If there are dirty knucklebones
in your pockets, gods help you.

00:31.375 --> 00:32.875
[lively music playing outside]

00:32.958 --> 00:33.916
Is this a dream?

00:34.000 --> 00:38.291
It's gonna be a nightmare if you don't rub
that sleep from your eyes and get moving!

00:38.375 --> 00:40.416
The knighting ceremony started
20 minutes ago,

00:40.500 --> 00:43.041
and your grandmother
has your dance card full.

00:44.041 --> 00:45.125
My grandmother?

00:45.208 --> 00:47.583
Yes. Her jaw is doing that…

00:48.500 --> 00:50.291
twitchy thing, you know the one.

01:00.333 --> 01:01.833
What the fuck's going on?

01:01.916 --> 01:03.875
Watch your mouth, Princess.

01:06.458 --> 01:07.458
What are you doing?

01:07.541 --> 01:08.833
[faint whispering]

01:08.916 --> 01:09.958
It's really you.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.041
She's gone mad.

01:12.666 --> 01:15.875
Banquet in full swing, she's gone mad.
You know what?

01:15.958 --> 01:17.833
-This…
-[cheering and applause outside]

01:18.333 --> 01:19.375
…doesn't matter.

01:19.458 --> 01:20.583
Let's go.

01:30.166 --> 01:32.166
[rhythmic, courtly music]

01:57.500 --> 01:58.458
[gasps]

02:03.541 --> 02:04.500
[Yennefer] Geralt!

02:06.166 --> 02:07.125
Geralt!

02:20.333 --> 02:21.166
Geralt.

02:25.208 --> 02:27.875
-Listen to me.
-[Geralt] You betrayed us.

02:27.958 --> 02:31.041
Geralt, please. It's not what you think!
Let me explain.

02:31.125 --> 02:33.750
Before Voleth Meir showed me
her true self, she came to me as a girl.

02:33.833 --> 02:36.083
Some fucked-up version of myself.

02:36.166 --> 02:37.625
Yes, she feeds on pain!

02:38.333 --> 02:40.708
But everyone on this Continent is in pain.

02:40.791 --> 02:43.708
Voleth Meir is more personal than that.
She's more specific.

02:44.500 --> 02:45.333
Explain.

02:45.958 --> 02:47.583
She finds your weakness,

02:48.416 --> 02:50.583
the gaping wound in your heart,

02:50.666 --> 02:54.625
the thing that makes you feel hopeless,
and she plunges her finger into it

02:54.708 --> 02:56.875
and makes it hurt so badly,
you'd do anything.

02:58.083 --> 03:00.250
Like sacrificing an innocent child.

03:01.833 --> 03:04.375
Yes. Except I couldn't do it!

03:05.583 --> 03:06.500
Geralt,

03:07.500 --> 03:11.500
I know this means nothing to you,
but I understand now how special she is!

03:12.458 --> 03:13.375
When Chaos left me,

03:13.458 --> 03:17.416
I never thought that I'd feel that spark,
that… life again,

03:17.500 --> 03:19.166
but Ciri, she radiates it.

03:20.041 --> 03:22.250
At Melitele's,
when I helped her control it,

03:22.750 --> 03:26.333
when she opened that portal
under my direction, I felt like…

03:27.416 --> 03:29.291
-Like…
-I know how it feels, Yennefer.

03:29.791 --> 03:32.083
I don't know
what Voleth Meir wants from Ciri,

03:32.916 --> 03:34.583
but we have to protect her.

03:37.666 --> 03:39.708
I have to protect her.

03:45.833 --> 03:48.083
[wind whistling]

03:48.833 --> 03:50.833
[courtly music]

03:54.458 --> 03:56.708
[music becomes distorted]

03:56.791 --> 03:58.791
[snoring]

04:03.291 --> 04:05.291
[rumbling]

04:06.875 --> 04:08.875
-[gasping]
-[blood flowing]

04:13.666 --> 04:15.041
[sighs]

04:17.500 --> 04:19.333
[choking]

04:21.208 --> 04:23.000
Shhh.

04:24.125 --> 04:25.875
Shhhh.

04:31.958 --> 04:33.583
-[squelch]
-[gasps]

04:37.875 --> 04:39.875
[choking]

04:39.958 --> 04:41.958
-[sighs]
-[withdraws blade]

04:55.291 --> 04:57.041
[inhaling deeply]

05:14.958 --> 05:16.083
[Geralt] Vesemir.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.708
Ciri. What's going on?

05:21.500 --> 05:22.583
Geralt?

05:22.666 --> 05:24.250
There's a woman out there.

05:24.333 --> 05:27.250
An old woman. In a black robe.

05:27.333 --> 05:28.875
-It's Voleth Meir.
-[Vesemir] Here?

05:29.875 --> 05:31.875
-In Kaer Morhen?
-Where is she now?

05:32.750 --> 05:36.125
I saw her leaving Everard's room.
We have to do something.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
She killed them.

05:38.708 --> 05:39.833
Everard and Gwain.

05:41.416 --> 05:42.916
How did you escape?

05:44.416 --> 05:45.541
I screamed.

05:46.416 --> 05:47.916
And that didn't cause any damage?

05:49.416 --> 05:51.583
-I don't know.
-It didn't wake Vesemir?

05:52.250 --> 05:55.166
-Geralt.
-I'm scared. Please.

06:12.083 --> 06:13.416
Tell me what you want.

06:28.458 --> 06:30.458
[intense rumbling]

06:36.750 --> 06:38.750
[crashing]

07:01.833 --> 07:03.833
[Lambert] I can't believe Ciri did this.

07:03.916 --> 07:06.041
She killed our brothers in our home.

07:06.125 --> 07:07.875
That thing ain't Ciri.

07:09.041 --> 07:10.833
Get anyone who's left.

07:12.625 --> 07:13.458
Vortek.

07:14.375 --> 07:15.375
Merek.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.541
She got Merek too.

07:21.125 --> 07:23.125
[sighs]

07:40.958 --> 07:43.041
Grab all the elixir you can find.

07:43.583 --> 07:45.500
We don't know what she can do.

07:48.916 --> 07:50.250
[Lambert] To the armory!

07:50.333 --> 07:51.500
[Coen] Find Ciri!

07:52.416 --> 07:54.583
[Geralt] Your fight's not with Ciri.

07:57.625 --> 07:59.583
[Lambert] Talbot! Let's both find…

07:59.666 --> 08:01.750
When you took Eskell down, it broke me.

08:02.333 --> 08:04.875
But you were right. It had to be done.

08:04.958 --> 08:06.375
Same as now.

08:06.458 --> 08:08.250
Ciri has to be eliminated.

08:08.750 --> 08:11.958
Daughter or demon,
she has done too much damage.

08:12.458 --> 08:14.375
Witchers don't kill out of fear.

08:14.875 --> 08:16.083
They kill to save lives.

08:17.166 --> 08:18.250
I said that.

08:18.833 --> 08:19.791
You did.

08:19.875 --> 08:21.958
It feels like bullshit now.

08:23.083 --> 08:25.083
Eskell, Remus,

08:25.166 --> 08:27.166
Gascaden, Sorel, Gwain.

08:28.500 --> 08:31.291
There are too many medallions
hanging on that tree.

08:31.375 --> 08:33.333
But spilling Ciri's blood

08:34.583 --> 08:36.000
won't bring them back.

08:36.083 --> 08:39.750
You thought she was strong enough
to be the next witcher.

08:40.750 --> 08:42.000
Just like I was.

08:44.166 --> 08:45.916
She can survive this.

08:47.541 --> 08:48.791
She needs you.

08:51.458 --> 08:53.291
I need you.

08:54.291 --> 08:55.458
[sighs]

08:58.875 --> 08:59.791
Wolf--

08:59.875 --> 09:02.416
I'll convince Voleth Meir
to leave Ciri's body.

09:02.500 --> 09:06.875
Once the demon's out, once she's back
in her corporeal form, we'll trap her.

09:06.958 --> 09:08.166
[Vesemir] Will it work?

09:08.250 --> 09:09.208
I don't know.

09:09.291 --> 09:11.791
But our best chance is together, Vesemir.

09:13.416 --> 09:15.791
-Huh.
-Please trust me.

09:51.500 --> 09:52.625
-Jaskier!
-Mm?

09:52.708 --> 09:56.000
-Jaskier. Jaskier, come on, wake up!
-Too many squirrels.

09:56.083 --> 09:57.041
-Jaskier!
-Aaah!

09:57.125 --> 09:58.083
I need you.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.666
It's Ciri. She's been possessed.

10:00.750 --> 10:03.375
[Jaskier] Yep.
The last time I woke up next to you,

10:03.458 --> 10:07.041
you grabbed me by the balls
and then blew up the building, so--

10:07.125 --> 10:08.166
Come on!

10:08.250 --> 10:10.250
Oh, for fuck's sake.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.500
Wait. Did you say possessed?

10:14.000 --> 10:15.166
[snorts]

10:16.041 --> 10:18.000
[horses neighing]

10:18.083 --> 10:20.000
[men shouting]

10:20.083 --> 10:21.666
[Filavandrel] Are you sure?

10:22.375 --> 10:23.333
He said he--

10:24.000 --> 10:26.625
Dijkstra said he didn't need me anymore.

10:28.125 --> 10:30.708
He had other ways
of getting what he wanted.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.083
Cirilla of Cintra?

10:37.333 --> 10:38.166
Yes.

10:38.250 --> 10:39.250
Well, what does…

10:41.583 --> 10:44.291
what did our daughter
have to do with that?

10:44.375 --> 10:46.875
Why would Redania target us?

10:46.958 --> 10:49.458
Mm, because we've befriended Nilfgaard.

10:50.416 --> 10:51.833
Because we're elves.

10:53.375 --> 10:54.500
They hate us.

10:56.208 --> 10:58.000
They've always hated us.

10:59.833 --> 11:02.791
They need no other reason
than the shape of our ears.

11:04.625 --> 11:05.583
I'm…

11:08.708 --> 11:09.583
I'm…

11:10.541 --> 11:11.541
I'm sorry.

11:13.708 --> 11:15.000
I was in jail, and…

11:17.041 --> 11:19.541
he told me his target was Nilfgaard and I…

11:20.541 --> 11:21.708
I never realized.

11:22.208 --> 11:23.833
I-- I never would have thought…

11:25.583 --> 11:27.041
You saved your own life.

11:28.291 --> 11:29.500
This is not your doing.

11:33.708 --> 11:35.250
I need you to gather some horses.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.250
[Jaskier] Before you tell me
what's going on,

11:50.333 --> 11:53.166
please tell me
you're making a hangover cure.

11:53.250 --> 11:57.083
Because my head feels like it's lodged
between the buttocks

11:57.166 --> 12:00.041
of a fat and sexually rageful goat.

12:00.125 --> 12:01.250
What are we doing?

12:01.333 --> 12:04.416
Voleth Meir is a parasite. We need
to remove her without killing the host.

12:04.500 --> 12:07.750
Oh, the Deathless Mother again.
Please, do go on.

12:08.250 --> 12:10.875
A spell from the extraction
or separation family would do it.

12:10.958 --> 12:13.708
Yes, it would.
If you had your magic, which you don't.

12:13.791 --> 12:15.208
If I had my fucking magic.

12:15.291 --> 12:18.416
Instead, I'll have to make do with
whatever I find in a witcher laboratory.

12:19.750 --> 12:20.916
Like this.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.791
Oh yay! A little stone.
You've saved us all.

12:23.875 --> 12:24.875
Active jasper.

12:24.958 --> 12:27.833
Provider of warmth, energy, balance.

12:28.375 --> 12:29.500
Golden oriole.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.208
Golden what? Areola?

12:32.208 --> 12:34.208
Pretty sure that's got
something to do with nipples.

12:34.291 --> 12:36.125
Neutralizes effects
of poisons in the blood.

12:36.208 --> 12:39.375
-But I'd make everything about nipples--
-Possession's like poison… Jaskier!

12:41.166 --> 12:44.625
I pulled Ciri into this mess, and I'll do
everything I can to get her out of it.

12:48.916 --> 12:50.041
Tell me what to do.

12:50.125 --> 12:50.958
Find Geralt.

12:52.125 --> 12:54.500
-Give him the jasper.
-What for?

12:54.583 --> 12:57.083
It helps turn wrongs into rights.
He'll understand.

12:57.166 --> 12:58.958
Wait, hang on. What are you gonna do?

12:59.041 --> 13:00.375
What witches do best.

13:00.458 --> 13:01.333
[sizzling]

13:01.416 --> 13:02.416
Make a potion.

13:09.041 --> 13:11.041
[tinkling]

13:23.750 --> 13:25.750
[lively music]

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
[cheering and laughter]

13:36.666 --> 13:38.125
[doors open]

13:39.500 --> 13:40.916
[Mousesack] Come along, Ciri!

13:44.250 --> 13:46.208
It's even better than I remember.

13:46.291 --> 13:47.916
Are you sure you're feeling all right?

13:49.791 --> 13:50.958
Better than ever.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.291
[sighs]

13:59.041 --> 14:00.791
[Mousesack] Your granddaughter.

14:01.583 --> 14:03.250
[Calanthe] As a member
of the royal family,

14:03.333 --> 14:05.166
is it too much
to expect that you exercise--

14:05.250 --> 14:06.416
A modicum of respect.

14:06.500 --> 14:07.500
Oh.

14:08.708 --> 14:09.666
Yes.

14:11.125 --> 14:12.250
I'm sorry I'm late.

14:30.333 --> 14:31.166
[Calanthe] Oh.

14:32.250 --> 14:33.500
[sighs]

14:35.458 --> 14:37.916
I know you think me too stern, child.

14:39.208 --> 14:40.041
No.

14:41.208 --> 14:43.375
No, I understand you want to protect me.

14:43.458 --> 14:44.416
Of course.

14:46.083 --> 14:48.625
Because I know
it's not the same here without you.

14:52.208 --> 14:53.208
Ahem.

14:54.750 --> 14:57.250
Your Highness.
Would you honor me with a dance?

14:57.333 --> 14:59.250
-[music stops]
-[applause]

14:59.833 --> 15:02.791
-She would love--
-I'd love to, Martin.

15:04.750 --> 15:06.958
[excited chatter and laughter]

15:08.791 --> 15:11.125
[applause continues]

15:11.208 --> 15:12.958
[cheering]

15:14.041 --> 15:15.791
[band plays slow, rhythmic tune]

15:33.583 --> 15:34.708
[chuckles softly]

15:34.791 --> 15:36.791
[music and laughter fade]

15:36.875 --> 15:38.875
[mournful music]

15:49.291 --> 15:50.958
[woman sobbing]

15:56.708 --> 15:58.000
[doors close]

15:59.416 --> 16:00.625
[Cahir] Check it again.

16:00.708 --> 16:03.416
There can be no mistakes
when Emperor Emhyr arrives.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.208
What is it?

16:10.291 --> 16:11.333
The elves.

16:12.750 --> 16:13.958
Some of them have gone.

16:14.458 --> 16:16.416
There are always defectors, Fringilla.

16:16.500 --> 16:17.958
It's to be expected.

16:18.708 --> 16:20.791
Francesca and Filavandrel
were amongst them.

16:22.083 --> 16:26.041
Our scouts said they were riding north
on stolen horses.

16:27.541 --> 16:29.791
To hunt down the murderer of their child.

16:31.250 --> 16:33.041
All fingers point to Redania.

16:34.041 --> 16:37.083
If she had told me,
I could have offered support.

16:37.875 --> 16:39.291
Troops, access to our army.

16:39.375 --> 16:42.083
-Whatever she needed, as long--
-As long as she came back?

16:43.333 --> 16:44.250
Yes.

16:45.166 --> 16:46.041
Why?

16:46.875 --> 16:49.625
Why is she so important to you, Fringilla?

16:49.708 --> 16:51.416
-She's my friend.
-No.

16:53.875 --> 16:54.708
No.

16:55.791 --> 16:58.291
She is the key to your plan.

16:59.416 --> 17:02.291
To showing Emhyr
that you are a valuable leader.

17:04.958 --> 17:05.875
Yes.

17:07.500 --> 17:08.791
Yes, that too.

17:10.375 --> 17:11.583
But she is gone.

17:12.458 --> 17:14.916
According to your plan.

17:15.666 --> 17:17.000
Think about it.

17:17.083 --> 17:18.875
The baby gave them hope.

17:19.541 --> 17:22.291
A reason to live rather than die fighting.

17:23.791 --> 17:25.416
And it's mysteriously murdered?

17:26.625 --> 17:27.583
And now…

17:28.333 --> 17:31.250
now they're off
to raze the kingdoms of our enemies.

17:32.916 --> 17:35.041
What-- what are you saying?

17:36.958 --> 17:38.250
I'm saying it worked.

17:41.250 --> 17:42.583
Your plan.

17:46.791 --> 17:47.958
But I would never do that.

17:49.083 --> 17:51.958
-Oh, I would never do that.
-You said it yourself, Fringilla.

17:52.458 --> 17:55.083
When Emhyr arrives, I need to rave.

17:58.125 --> 17:59.166
So let me.

18:05.583 --> 18:07.583
[thrilling, dramatic music]

18:33.750 --> 18:35.291
Where are you, Ciri?

18:40.666 --> 18:41.625
Ciri?

18:44.333 --> 18:45.333
Ciri!

18:46.166 --> 18:47.541
Come along, girl!

18:48.666 --> 18:50.000
What is this?

18:53.208 --> 18:54.125
Ciri!

18:56.833 --> 18:58.875
-[sighs]
-[Coen] Ciri!

[tinkling]

19:10.750 --> 19:12.750
[creaking]

19:18.416 --> 19:20.208
You don't want to escape.

19:29.375 --> 19:30.916
So many gone.

19:31.916 --> 19:34.666
Devoured by this hellish Continent.

19:35.208 --> 19:37.041
I want Ciri back.

19:37.750 --> 19:39.333
Name your price.

19:39.833 --> 19:40.916
[Lambert] She's here!

19:43.208 --> 19:44.416
I'll cover the back.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.166
It's not a question of price.

19:50.458 --> 19:52.333
It's a matter of cost.

19:53.916 --> 19:56.208
-[Coen] Steady, boys.
-[Ciri] Make your ask.

19:57.333 --> 19:58.500
Release her,

19:59.458 --> 20:00.791
and you can have me.

20:01.500 --> 20:02.708
[distorted laugh]

20:06.375 --> 20:07.791
That is enticing.

20:09.250 --> 20:13.458
What glorious pain
we could create together.

20:15.416 --> 20:16.833
It's too late for that.

20:17.541 --> 20:18.875
[Jaskier] Geralt!

20:20.333 --> 20:22.458
Yennefer told me to…

20:22.541 --> 20:24.500
Shhhhit.

20:25.208 --> 20:26.041
You're busy.

20:27.083 --> 20:27.916
You're busy.

20:30.875 --> 20:31.708
Yeah.

22:11.458 --> 22:13.375
What the fuck kind of basilisks are those?

22:13.458 --> 22:15.083
I'll tell you after I kill 'em.

22:15.666 --> 22:17.083
I won't let her have you, Ciri.

22:18.083 --> 22:19.666
[basilisks growling]

22:21.083 --> 22:22.041

22:30.875 --> 22:33.708
-Yrden, now!
-Wolf!

22:33.791 --> 22:35.541
Vesemir, I can do this!

22:35.625 --> 22:37.083
We have to contain her.

22:50.833 --> 22:52.791
Tell me what you want with her.

22:53.708 --> 22:55.333
Tell me what she is to you.

22:55.958 --> 22:57.875
[Voleth Meir] She is the future.

22:59.750 --> 23:01.583
And you're in my way.

23:07.291 --> 23:09.208
Ciri! I need you to hear me!

23:09.666 --> 23:12.208
-[growls]
-You can fight this!

23:12.958 --> 23:15.250
[Calanthe] I know
it's not the same here without you.

23:20.416 --> 23:22.916
-[groans]
-Geralt!

23:24.375 --> 23:25.458
Aah…

23:27.333 --> 23:28.375
Right the wrongs?

23:28.458 --> 23:31.458
Well, Yennefer, I don't see how
things could get any wronger!

23:31.541 --> 23:33.125
[yelps]

Geralt! Yennefer told me to give you this!

24:32.333 --> 24:35.333
It's-- it's balance and heat and…

24:35.416 --> 24:37.000
Oh, you can't hear me.

24:41.291 --> 24:42.541
Geralt!

24:47.333 --> 24:48.208
No!

24:54.250 --> 24:55.416
You'll never get to me.

24:58.458 --> 25:01.791
[voices overlapping] Do it.
Show him you don't need him any more.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.000
[Vesemir roars]

25:04.208 --> 25:05.666

25:25.208 --> 25:26.500
May I cut in?

25:30.416 --> 25:33.000
You know, Princess,
if you marry Martin Marbury,

25:33.083 --> 25:36.083
you'll continue
quite the exceptional bloodline.

25:36.166 --> 25:37.541
Gross.

[applause and cheering]

25:42.791 --> 25:44.791

25:47.541 --> 25:49.000
My bloodline, Mousesack.

25:50.208 --> 25:52.125
Will you tell me more about it?

25:52.708 --> 25:53.583
Right now?

25:54.541 --> 25:57.666
I fear there is not
a long enough song in existence.

25:59.458 --> 26:00.750
Then someday soon?

26:09.291 --> 26:10.291
I promise.

26:13.291 --> 26:14.791
Your family, Princess,

26:16.750 --> 26:18.750

26:19.250 --> 26:21.000
they're quite extraordinary.

26:31.666 --> 26:32.875

26:34.750 --> 26:37.458
[Geralt] You know who you really are.

26:38.916 --> 26:41.125
Princess, are you all right?

26:42.458 --> 26:43.625
My grandmother.

26:44.666 --> 26:46.541
Why did she never tell me the truth?

26:47.208 --> 26:48.291
About who I am?

26:49.583 --> 26:52.333
My dear, you must be tired already.

26:52.416 --> 26:56.375
Your father will be so disappointed
he doesn't get a dance.

-Is he still fussing?
-[baby crying]

27:29.166 --> 27:31.083
I don't know what could be wrong with him.

27:31.166 --> 27:34.208
King Vizimir himself
can probably hear these cries.

27:34.291 --> 27:35.291
Give him to me.

27:36.291 --> 27:37.875
Come. Come.

There aren't many elves left in Redania.

28:05.333 --> 28:06.500
Are you sure about this?

28:06.583 --> 28:09.250
There'll be no moving forward
without retribution.

Sister, there are other ways.

32:32.291 --> 32:33.541
I'm not doing anything.

32:33.625 --> 32:35.541
-[Vesemir] I believe in you.
-Vesemir?

32:35.625 --> 32:37.250
I'm sorry for what I did.

32:37.333 --> 32:38.458
Be with us.

32:38.541 --> 32:39.833
[rumbling]

32:40.416 --> 32:41.500
You belong here.

32:43.916 --> 32:44.791
Stay.

32:46.083 --> 32:46.916
Stay.

32:49.458 --> 32:50.375
[echoing] Stay with us.

32:50.458 --> 32:52.041
Stay with us… stay…

32:55.625 --> 32:57.166
I'm not going anywhere.

32:58.250 --> 33:00.708
All right? I'm staying right here.

33:00.791 --> 33:03.583
Just, please, don't leave me.

33:04.583 --> 33:07.791
[Voleth Meir] I'm not going anywhere.

33:08.458 --> 33:11.375
I'm staying right here.

33:11.458 --> 33:13.500
Living in her.

33:13.583 --> 33:14.541
Forever.

33:15.500 --> 33:16.916
Her hut burned.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.708
She needs a vessel
to exist within this sphere.

33:22.333 --> 33:23.750
Ciri can't escape.

33:23.833 --> 33:24.958
Unless…

33:28.250 --> 33:30.708
-[glass smashes]
-[Yennefer] Unless I right this wrong.

33:30.791 --> 33:32.625
-My wounds wouldn't heal…
-Yen.

33:32.708 --> 33:34.750
…because magic wasn't what I was missing.

33:34.833 --> 33:36.791
-I can be the vessel.
-No.

33:36.875 --> 33:38.625
-For her.
-[Geralt] Yen!

33:39.458 --> 33:40.708
[Yennefer gasps]

33:42.791 --> 33:44.583
[speaking in Elder]

33:46.833 --> 33:48.500
-[wind gusting]
-No!

33:48.583 --> 33:51.083
[Yennefer speaking in Elder]

33:52.541 --> 33:55.500
[repeating spell]

33:56.666 --> 33:59.791
[repeating spell]

34:01.250 --> 34:02.750
Don't let us die again.

34:02.833 --> 34:04.875
-[wind whistling]
-[sighs]

34:04.958 --> 34:05.958
We're your family.

34:07.791 --> 34:09.458
We're your everything.

34:11.500 --> 34:13.791
[Yennefer] You deserve everything, Ciri.

34:13.875 --> 34:16.333
Let me give you everything I have.

34:17.458 --> 34:19.083
[Ciri] I don't know what to do.

34:19.166 --> 34:20.000
[gasps]

34:20.083 --> 34:21.833
Please, don't go.

34:23.291 --> 34:24.625
Don't go, please.

34:31.083 --> 34:32.750
[Geralt] I know you're afraid, Ciri,

34:33.541 --> 34:35.375
but what you see in there…

34:35.458 --> 34:37.791
-[sighs]
-…it isn't real.

34:46.208 --> 34:48.000
[breathing shakily]

34:48.083 --> 34:49.208
Don't do this.

34:58.041 --> 34:58.875
Ciri.

35:02.125 --> 35:03.875
-Ciri…
-Be with us.

35:05.250 --> 35:08.291
You belong with us.

35:09.416 --> 35:11.083
[Geralt] We belong together.

35:12.458 --> 35:13.333
You,

35:14.375 --> 35:15.291
us,

35:16.833 --> 35:18.250
it's not perfect,

35:19.166 --> 35:20.375
but it is real.

35:21.500 --> 35:22.666
It's yours.

35:26.208 --> 35:28.500
We are your family…

35:31.000 --> 35:32.333
and we need you.

35:35.666 --> 35:37.208
I have to go home.

36:20.041 --> 36:21.125
[Ciri sighs]

36:21.208 --> 36:22.666
-[gasps]
-[embers hissing]

36:25.458 --> 36:26.833
[Geralt] We don't have much time.

36:26.916 --> 36:28.875
We need to trap Voleth Meir
once and for all.

36:28.958 --> 36:30.708
[flames hissing]

36:30.791 --> 36:33.125
If you can pull monsters
through the monolith,

36:33.208 --> 36:34.708
you can send one back again.

36:35.208 --> 36:36.083
What?

36:36.916 --> 36:38.125
You can do this.

36:39.208 --> 36:40.208
Yennefer's lessons.

36:40.291 --> 36:42.250
-But I don't know if I can--
-I believe in you.

36:46.250 --> 36:47.166
All right.

36:54.291 --> 36:55.208
See the outcome.

36:55.791 --> 36:56.625
[rumbling]

36:56.708 --> 36:57.916
Make it happen.

36:58.666 --> 37:00.000
-[wind gusting]
-[gasping]

37:00.583 --> 37:01.541
Oh, not again.

37:02.125 --> 37:04.208
-[shouts in Elder]
-[deep, intense rumbling]

37:04.291 --> 37:06.375
-[voices whispering]
-[crashing]

37:07.625 --> 37:09.083
[wind rushing]

37:09.166 --> 37:10.291
-[Ciri yells]
-[power blasts]

37:10.375 --> 37:12.333
-[Geralt yelps]
-[Ciri gasps]

37:16.208 --> 37:17.708
-[Ciri cries out]
-[Geralt grunts]

37:20.625 --> 37:22.625
[gasping]

37:27.666 --> 37:29.666
[wind sighing]

37:31.125 --> 37:32.458
[wind gusting]

37:33.291 --> 37:34.666
[echoing cry]

37:37.750 --> 37:39.083
She's leaving.

37:39.791 --> 37:41.708
[rumbling]

37:45.041 --> 37:47.041
[cackling]

37:49.625 --> 37:51.791
[screeching laughter]

37:53.458 --> 37:55.458
[neighing]

38:02.875 --> 38:04.625
[echoing laughter]

38:09.333 --> 38:11.125
Child of the Elder Blood,

38:11.208 --> 38:13.750
starry-eyed Daughter of Chaos,

38:14.375 --> 38:15.750
join our Hunt.

38:16.291 --> 38:18.416
Your place is among us.

38:19.708 --> 38:21.208
[hissing]

38:21.291 --> 38:23.416
[echoing] You are ours.

38:24.125 --> 38:25.750
Ciri!

38:27.208 --> 38:28.375
[intense whooshing]

38:29.708 --> 38:31.125
[whispering voice] Ciri…

38:31.208 --> 38:32.625
[gasping]

38:34.458 --> 38:35.708
[sighs]

38:40.291 --> 38:42.125
[Jaskier] You're back. Are you all right?

38:43.875 --> 38:45.416
[gasps] Wh--

38:47.208 --> 38:48.875
Were those the Wraiths of Mörhogg?

38:49.375 --> 38:51.541
The Wild Hunt, yes.

38:53.333 --> 38:55.250
We're safe now, thanks to you.

38:56.916 --> 38:58.375
That's all that matters.

39:07.083 --> 39:08.291
The witchers need you.

39:12.166 --> 39:13.291
[grunts]

39:17.333 --> 39:18.541
[speaking in Elder]

39:24.750 --> 39:26.250
[Coen sighs]

39:26.333 --> 39:27.500
[gasps]

39:35.708 --> 39:37.791
You're panting like a dying mammoth.

39:37.875 --> 39:39.041
[both chuckle]

39:39.833 --> 39:41.041
[Jaskier] Look at us.

39:41.125 --> 39:43.083
Just one big happy family, eh?

39:43.166 --> 39:44.000
No.

39:45.541 --> 39:46.625
Right. Yeah.

39:51.916 --> 39:52.958
[sighs]

40:04.000 --> 40:05.125
Where did you go?

40:06.125 --> 40:08.125
I'm still trying to work that out.

40:10.291 --> 40:11.583
I saw the Wild Hunt.

40:12.875 --> 40:14.166
Hmm.

40:15.708 --> 40:17.458
We need to gather more supplies.

40:17.541 --> 40:19.000
Start to rebuild again.

40:19.083 --> 40:20.500
Ciri and I can't stay.

40:21.750 --> 40:23.125
We need to keep moving.

40:23.208 --> 40:25.166
Sorry, Wolf. I should have trusted you!

40:25.250 --> 40:27.583
Vesemir, it's not that.

40:27.666 --> 40:29.708
The demon. The Wild Hunt.

40:29.791 --> 40:32.416
She's marked for something,
and it doesn't end there.

40:32.500 --> 40:34.875
If mages and royals find out
she's still alive,

40:34.958 --> 40:36.666
and what she's capable of…

40:39.541 --> 40:41.375
they won't stop coming for her.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.333
[Tissaia] She had green eyes!

40:43.416 --> 40:44.500
[thunder rumbling]

40:44.583 --> 40:46.166
And ashen hair.

40:46.708 --> 40:49.166
-It was her.
-[heavy rainfall]

40:49.791 --> 40:52.000
The Lion Cub of Cintra,

40:52.083 --> 40:55.083
alive and at Sodden with a witcher.

40:55.166 --> 40:57.708
Why are we only hearing about this now?

40:58.291 --> 41:01.791
Sigismund Dijkstra came to Aretuza,
sniffing for something.

41:02.375 --> 41:05.250
You think he was prodding to see
if the Brotherhood knew Cirilla was alive?

41:05.833 --> 41:07.291
[thunder rumbling]

41:07.375 --> 41:08.833
I do, Meve.

41:10.541 --> 41:13.916
[Foltest] He finds Cirilla
and marries her off to his king.

41:14.625 --> 41:17.291
Giving him
the only rightful claim to Cintra.

41:17.791 --> 41:19.666
Redania's wealthy enough.

41:20.166 --> 41:23.250
They add Cintra to their realm, we'll all
be taking orders from fucking Vizimir.

41:23.333 --> 41:27.375
Dijkstra no doubt already has his spies
looking high and low for her.

41:27.958 --> 41:29.458
I'm just going to say it.

41:30.041 --> 41:33.083
Princess Cirilla created far less trouble
for us when she was dead.

41:35.125 --> 41:36.458
We'll put a bounty on the girl.

41:38.875 --> 41:40.916
And anyone who protects her.

41:43.708 --> 41:46.625
That's quite barbarous. Even for me.

41:47.375 --> 41:48.791
Welcome to the Brotherhood.

41:48.875 --> 41:49.875
[Foltesr and Heltest] Aye!

41:53.458 --> 41:56.250
[Rience] While the path hasn't been
the straight line we hoped for,

41:56.333 --> 41:59.000
we are nonetheless in an auspicious place.

42:00.208 --> 42:02.791
The elves are up in arms
over the death of their baby.

42:02.875 --> 42:05.333
Nilfgaard is stoking their anger
to foster another war.

42:05.416 --> 42:07.583
And the North will,
no doubt, take the bait.

42:09.291 --> 42:11.958
And as chaos descends upon the Continent,

42:12.708 --> 42:15.125
we will be focused on getting the girl.

42:17.791 --> 42:19.833
[Lydia, echoing]
I won't let you down again,

42:20.375 --> 42:21.916
my lord… my lord… my lord…

42:22.666 --> 42:25.958
[Gage] We should return to Xin'trea
before they come for us.

42:26.041 --> 42:28.000
-[owl hooting]
-Let them come.

42:28.583 --> 42:29.791
We got our revenge.

42:30.750 --> 42:32.333
Let it end there.

42:32.416 --> 42:33.583
[Francesca] Revenge?

42:35.000 --> 42:36.750
When the humans arrived,

42:36.833 --> 42:38.541
we welcomed them as peers,

42:39.083 --> 42:40.791
instead of seeing what they really were.

42:42.375 --> 42:44.958
And it led to a mass grave
we dug ourselves.

42:46.916 --> 42:50.833
I don't want revenge. I want justice.

42:50.916 --> 42:52.250
-[guard] Out the way!
-[grunting]

42:53.833 --> 42:55.291
-Come on.
-Out the way.

42:56.208 --> 42:59.000
I caught him watching by the riverbank.
Says he's from Xin'trea.

42:59.083 --> 43:02.416
-My name is Istredd. I'm a mage.
-You're a human.

43:02.500 --> 43:04.458
I have information I think could help you.

43:04.541 --> 43:07.083
There is a girl,
Princess Cirilla of Cintra.

43:07.958 --> 43:10.500
-She is why Nilfgaard attacked Sodden.
-[Filavandrel] We know that.

43:10.583 --> 43:13.000
Why they wanted to train you
for attacks! To flush her out.

43:13.083 --> 43:14.416
-Get rid of him.
-[Istredd] No!

43:15.416 --> 43:16.666
[gasps] She's Hen Ikeir!

43:16.750 --> 43:19.083
-She's Hen Ikeir!
-Stop!

43:21.083 --> 43:22.500
Bring him back.

43:28.083 --> 43:28.958
What did you say?

43:31.000 --> 43:32.833
She's Hen Ikeir.

43:34.916 --> 43:36.625
She's-- she's Elder Blood?

43:38.416 --> 43:39.416
She's all of you.

43:40.541 --> 43:41.541
But different.

43:42.666 --> 43:45.125
-I've never seen anything like her power.
-[owl hooting]

43:45.208 --> 43:46.458
What are you saying?

43:47.708 --> 43:49.083
The one Ithlinne prophesied.

43:52.750 --> 43:54.708
He's saying she could save us.

44:06.541 --> 44:07.791
[coos]

44:09.166 --> 44:10.416
What are you saying?

44:12.375 --> 44:13.958
[wings flapping]

44:14.041 --> 44:16.708
I'm saying word is out about the girl.

44:18.291 --> 44:19.375
[scoffs]

44:19.458 --> 44:23.750
Well, I daresay
things just got more fun, Philippa.

44:26.125 --> 44:27.250
Bring me the bard.

44:27.833 --> 44:29.708
It's about time
he paid back his benefactor.

44:46.250 --> 44:47.666
You're whole again.

44:49.750 --> 44:51.416
I felt it come back when I…

44:52.041 --> 44:53.000
I…

44:53.083 --> 44:55.375
When you sacrificed yourself for Ciri.

44:55.958 --> 44:57.666
A sacrifice I'd make again.

44:58.958 --> 44:59.916
In a heartbeat.

45:01.500 --> 45:03.000
I don't forgive you, Yennefer.

45:09.208 --> 45:10.500
I know I've hurt you.

45:12.125 --> 45:14.458
Yet I can't help but wish
it could begin again.

45:16.583 --> 45:19.125
Use your knowledge of magic
to train the girl.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.916
You're the only person
who's helped her control her powers.

45:24.416 --> 45:26.666
As if I'd trust anyone else with her.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.791
Villentretenmerth told us
we were made for each other.

45:32.958 --> 45:34.583
Destined for each other.

45:35.291 --> 45:36.875
And that nothing would come of it

45:37.375 --> 45:39.708
because destiny alone isn't sufficient.

45:42.875 --> 45:44.375
Something more is needed.

45:48.833 --> 45:51.250
She is something more.

46:24.083 --> 46:26.416
[Ciri] Every time
I think I can move forward,

46:27.708 --> 46:30.833
there's this force
bringing me back into darkness.

46:32.208 --> 46:34.708
I'm just tired, Geralt.

46:35.375 --> 46:36.916
[Geralt] I'm tired too, Ciri.

46:38.125 --> 46:39.583
But what of it?

46:41.000 --> 46:42.208
Life goes on.

46:43.666 --> 46:45.875
Us three, we'll help each other.

46:48.083 --> 46:49.958
What is destined cannot be avoided.

46:52.750 --> 46:54.000
And it shouldn't be.

47:00.791 --> 47:03.333
I believe I know
what Voleth Meir wanted from you.

47:04.208 --> 47:05.041
What?

47:05.125 --> 47:07.375
She's been here since the Conjunction.

47:07.458 --> 47:08.708
We knew that.

47:08.791 --> 47:11.083
We've always assumed
she was from another sphere.

47:12.166 --> 47:14.041
Is that where I portalled us?

47:15.875 --> 47:16.833
Another sphere?

47:16.916 --> 47:18.916
Those monoliths that you shatter,

47:19.416 --> 47:22.458
the ones that pull new species of monster
through every time you scream,

47:23.125 --> 47:25.583
those could be gateways to other spheres.

47:26.125 --> 47:27.750
My scream woke Voleth Meir.

47:28.708 --> 47:30.250
That's why she wanted me.

47:30.333 --> 47:31.916
She wanted to go home.

47:33.041 --> 47:35.166
You were the key to her future.

47:38.666 --> 47:40.583
What I can't figure out, though,

47:41.333 --> 47:44.125
is when did Nilfgaard realize
that you were the key to theirs?

47:44.750 --> 47:46.916
They knew before anyone else.

47:49.083 --> 47:51.375
How do they know
the truth about you, Ciri?

47:55.208 --> 47:56.583
[doors open]

47:56.666 --> 48:01.833
[page] Attention!
His Highness Emperor Emhyr var Emreis,

48:01.916 --> 48:03.250
the White Flame.

48:03.875 --> 48:06.125
[Fringilla] The elves
are already fighting in the North.

48:06.208 --> 48:09.083
They may not wear our colors,
but they are doing our bidding.

48:09.958 --> 48:10.791
And…

48:11.375 --> 48:13.958
they are pursuing the girl, of course.

48:14.041 --> 48:18.166
[Emhyr] In my experience,
elves only care about elves.

48:19.666 --> 48:21.083
How did you convince them to fight?

48:21.666 --> 48:23.125
By killing their hope.

48:23.791 --> 48:24.666
[Emhyr] Hm.

48:24.750 --> 48:26.583
We lay the blame on Redania.

48:29.708 --> 48:32.208
But it was us who killed the elven baby.

48:34.375 --> 48:36.250
We would do anything for the White Flame.

48:36.750 --> 48:38.791
[Emhyr] Losing a child is…

48:39.708 --> 48:42.041
brutal, but you are right.

48:43.166 --> 48:45.083
It can move mountains.

48:45.166 --> 48:47.083
-Desperate times.
-Desperate measures.

48:47.166 --> 48:49.083
Desperate indeed.

48:50.291 --> 48:51.291
I would know.

48:52.125 --> 48:53.000
Sir?

48:53.750 --> 48:56.166
That's how I felt when I realized

48:56.250 --> 48:58.583
I could no longer count on you

48:59.291 --> 49:01.083
to fulfill my mission.

49:02.916 --> 49:06.000
I'm the one who ordered
the death of that elven baby.

49:06.583 --> 49:07.666
I had to.

49:07.750 --> 49:10.375
It was the best path to helping me

49:10.458 --> 49:12.875
find my daughter.

49:21.958 --> 49:23.791
