-WELL, THERE'S ANOTHER ONE WENT
RUNNING THAT WAY.

04:23.233 --> 04:24.967

04:25.067 --> 04:26.433
-I BELIEVE ALL RED.

04:26.533 --> 04:28.267

04:42.400 --> 04:44.067
BOY MAY HAVE TOOK THE CAR.

04:45.067 --> 04:48.067
CAR'S OVER THERE,
IN THE WOODS.

04:49.167 --> 04:52.067
ONCE IT HIT THE CURB, IT JUST
MUST HAVE KIND OF JUST
CURVED ON BACK.

04:52.167 --> 04:56.600
PIECES FROM THE CAR THAT FELL,
HITTING THE TWO-FOOT MEDIAN.

04:56.700 --> 04:59.667
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE COULD
JUMP IT WITH A CHRYSLER SEBRING.

05:01.067 --> 05:03.133
IT'S A DIRECTLY STRAIGHT LINE,
SLOWLY ROLLING.

05:04.600 --> 05:07.167
THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT TREE.
IF NOT, IT'D BE DOWN IN THAT
LITTLE BRUSH CREEK,

05:07.267 --> 05:09.767
RIGHT DOWN THERE,
THAT LITTLE--
THAT LITTLE STREAM.

05:12.733 --> 05:15.200
WELL, WE GOT APPROACHED BY A...

05:16.867 --> 05:19.767
BY A CITIZEN SAYING THAT
HER CAR WAS JUST TAKEN FROM HER,

05:19.867 --> 05:22.167
AND IT SOUNDS LIKE WE GOT
BOTH PARTIES IN CUSTODY NOW.

05:22.267 --> 05:26.733
WE CHASED ONE AROUND
SOME BUILDINGS. ANOTHER GUY'S
DUCKED DOWN IN SOME WOODS.

05:27.767 --> 05:32.067
SOUNDS LIKE AN OFFICER HAS HIM.
JUST KIND OF WAITING FOR
ANOTHER OFFICER TO GET THERE.

05:32.100 --> 05:34.133
-WHAT WERE YOU RUNNING
IN THE CAR FOR?

05:34.233 --> 05:36.867
-(over radio) 20-30.
WHAT'S YOUR STATUS IN K9S?

05:37.967 --> 05:41.333
-(over radio) K9'S ALREADY
ON THE TRAIL.
WE TRACKED HIM DOWN.

05:41.433 --> 05:43.100
UH, WE'RE ALONG THE CREEK BAY.

05:44.100 --> 05:47.300
-THAT'S SOME NICE SHOES
YOU GOT ON.
-THEY'RE OLD BOOTS.

05:47.400 --> 05:50.800
-THEY'RE LOOKING CRAZY, BRO.
I NEED TO GET SOME OF THOSE.

05:50.900 --> 05:52.533
-I KNOW. YOU NEED TO RUN
A LITTLE FASTER.

05:52.633 --> 05:54.333
-(over radio) KEEP YOUR HEAD
ON A SWIVEL...

05:54.433 --> 05:56.800
-YOU READY TO GO?
-YEAH, HE'S READY.

05:56.900 --> 05:58.867
HE ACTUALLY WANTS TO
TALK TO A SUPERVISOR.

05:58.967 --> 06:01.233
YOU STILL WANT A SUPERVISOR
TO COME OVER, OR YOU GOOD?

06:02.833 --> 06:05.500
-(over radio) 19-24.
YOU'RE CLEAR NOW.
WE HAVE THE LAST ONE IN CUSTODY.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.200
-LAST ONE'S IN CUSTODY.

06:09.467 --> 06:10.900
YOU GOOD WITH HIM?

06:11.067 --> 06:13.167
-YOU HAVE ANY SHARP OBJECTS,
ANYTHING THAT'S GOING
TO POKE ME?

06:13.267 --> 06:16.700
-SO WHEN YOU GUYS FLAGGED US
DOWN, HOW DID YOU GUYS FIND OUT
YOUR CAR WAS THERE?

06:17.700 --> 06:19.933
-'CAUSE WE HAD GPS
WITH OUR CAR LOT.

06:20.067 --> 06:21.267
-OH, YOU HAD GPS ON IT?

06:21.367 --> 06:22.667
-SO IT JUST HIT--
JUST HIT THERE.

06:22.767 --> 06:24.733
THE FAMILY DOLLAR WAS
THE LAST ONE.
THAT'S WHERE YOU SAW IT?

06:24.833 --> 06:27.733
-YEAH, 'CAUSE THE FIRST HIT WAS
LIKE IT'S ON FAMILY DOLLAR. WE
WENT PAST THERE, WE WERE LIKE--

06:27.833 --> 06:29.067
"I DON'T SEE MY CAR.
IT'S NOT THERE."

06:29.167 --> 06:31.467
SO I GUESS THEY MUST HAVE
TURNED AROUND AND CAME BACK.

06:31.567 --> 06:34.133
'CAUSE WHEN WE TURNED AROUND,
THERE IT WAS.

06:34.233 --> 06:35.933
-AND YOU WERE REAL SHOCKED
WHEN YOU SAW IT?
-UH-HUH.

06:36.067 --> 06:38.467
SAID, "OH, LOOK AT THAT."
(laughs)

06:38.567 --> 06:40.767
AW MAN.
-YEAH, YOUR CAR LOOKS
PRETTY ROUGH.

06:40.867 --> 06:42.733
-YEAH, MY CAR... (indistinct)

06:42.833 --> 06:45.167
-LOOKS LIKE THE FRONT END OF
YOUR CAR IS PRETTY BEAT UP.

06:45.267 --> 06:47.300
SO, THE TRACKING DEVICE
ACTUALLY GOT THEIR CAR BACK.

06:47.400 --> 06:50.267
IT'S A LITTLE MORE DAMAGED, BUT
AT LEAST SHE GOT IT BACK.
-YEAH.

06:50.367 --> 06:52.167
YOU GOT YOUR PROPERTY BACK, TOO.

06:52.267 --> 06:55.133
-WHO CAUGHT HIM? YOU CHASED HIM?
-YEAH WE CHASED HIM.

06:55.233 --> 06:57.200
WE BOTH TACKLED HIM. SAME TIME.

06:57.300 --> 06:58.833
-OH, YOU JUST-- OKAY.

06:58.933 --> 07:01.500
-WE GOT BOTH PEOPLE THAT
STOLE YOUR CAR.
THEY'RE BOTH GOING TO JAIL.

07:01.600 --> 07:02.600
JUST LUCKY TIMING.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.133
-CAR THIEVES ARE A BIG PROBLEM.

07:07.233 --> 07:10.767
SACRAMENTO'S HISTORICALLY
BEEN CLOSE TO OR IN THE TOP TEN
IN AUTO THEFT.

07:10.867 --> 07:13.233
OUR DETAIL HANDLES
ANYTHING AUTO RELATED.

07:13.333 --> 07:15.167
ARRESTS, PROBATION SEARCHES,

07:15.267 --> 07:18.633
TO JUST BEING OUT THERE WHERE
THE STOLEN CARS ARE BEING
TAKEN AND DUMPED.

07:18.733 --> 07:20.800
AND WE PUT OURSELVES
IN THOSE SITUATIONS,

07:20.900 --> 07:23.333
AND WE MAKE A LOT OF ARRESTS
AND A LOT OF RECOVERIES.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.667
-THIS BLUE HONDA RIGHT HERE

07:27.767 --> 07:30.867
HAS A DIFFERENT PLATE IN THE
FRONT, WHICH ACTUALLY COMES BACK
TO THAT CAR,

07:30.967 --> 07:32.567
AND IT, UH, REPORTED STOLEN.

07:34.100 --> 07:36.333
-ACE TWO, PULLING INTO
THE CHEVRON.

07:53.067 --> 07:55.867
-ACE TWO, TWO AT GUNPOINT.

07:56.967 --> 07:58.767
STAND UP. HANDS ON
THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD.

07:58.867 --> 08:01.767
FACE AWAY FROM ME.
-GET YOUR HANDS UP.

-BACK UP.
-COOL, I'LL WALK HIM BACK
TO YOU.

08:09.100 --> 08:11.267
-STOP RIGHT THERE.
SPREAD YOUR FEET APART WIDE.

08:12.433 --> 08:14.900
PASSENGER, STEP OUT OF THE CAR,

08:15.067 --> 08:17.067
SLOWLY, WITH YOUR
HANDS ON THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD.

08:17.133 --> 08:19.367
-COME ON BACK, TO ME.

08:19.467 --> 08:21.167
STOP. TURN RIGHT.

08:21.267 --> 08:22.533
TURN TO YOUR RIGHT.
TURN TO YOUR RIGHT.

08:22.633 --> 08:25.333
TURN TO YOUR RIGHT.
COME BACK TO ME.
COME BACK TO ME.

08:27.667 --> 08:29.267
-WE'RE CLEARED
FROM THIS SIDE, SARGE.

08:32.200 --> 08:34.600
(indistinct radio chatter)

08:34.700 --> 08:37.400
-OKAY, BROTHER.
WHO'S CAR?
-YEAH.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.833
UH, HE TOLD ME
TO DRIVE IT FOR HIM,

08:39.933 --> 08:41.867
BUT, IT'S NOT MY CAR, OBVIOUSLY.

08:41.967 --> 08:44.367
-HE TOLD YOU
TO DRIVE IT FOR HIM?
-YEAH. IT'S NOT MY CAR.

08:44.467 --> 08:46.833
-OBVIOUSLY, IT'S NOT YOUR CAR.
-WELL, IT'S OBVIOUS, YEAH.

08:46.933 --> 08:48.600
-WELL, YOU KNOW SOMETHING'S
WRONG WITH IT, RIGHT?

08:48.700 --> 08:50.900
-OBVIOUSLY, YEAH.
-(chuckles)

08:51.067 --> 08:52.300
WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT,
IN YOUR OPINION?

08:52.400 --> 08:57.067
UH, THE STEERING COLUMN
IS MISSING SO IT LOOKS STOLEN.

08:57.167 --> 08:58.833
-WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU?
-IT LOOKS STOLEN.

08:59.833 --> 09:01.667
-YOU NOTICE IT'S GOT
TWO DIFFERENT PLATES ON IT?

09:02.733 --> 09:04.067
-I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT.

09:05.233 --> 09:07.267
I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT AT ALL.
-HANG TIGHT FOR ME, BROTHER.

09:12.700 --> 09:14.100
WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:14.200 --> 09:15.700
-I'M NOT SURE. YOU TELL--

09:15.800 --> 09:17.233
-HE SAYS YOU ASKED HIM
TO DRIVE THAT CAR.

09:18.233 --> 09:20.100
THAT'S NOT TRUE?
-NO, SIR.

09:20.933 --> 09:22.233
-OKAY.
-DID NOT ASK HIM.

09:22.333 --> 09:23.667
-THAT SEEMS PRETTY--

09:23.767 --> 09:26.300
-A COUPLE DAYS AGO, HE CAME
AND PICKED ME UP WITH THAT CAR.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.733
TODAY HE PICKED ME UP
WITH THAT CAR, AND THE IGNITION
WAS ALL BROKEN APART,

09:32.067 --> 09:33.700
AND, UH, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

09:33.800 --> 09:37.100
HE SAID HE LOST HIS KEY. SO I
TOLD HIM, OKAY, IF I GIVE YOU
SOME GAS MONEY,

09:37.200 --> 09:40.267
SO I CAN PICK UP MY CAR
NEXT TO THE GREYHOUND STATION,

09:40.367 --> 09:43.900
AND AFTER THAT WE'LL GO TO
PICK AND PULL, AND I'LL HELP
YOU FIX IT.

09:44.067 --> 09:47.467
SO THAT'S WHAT WE WERE
ON OUR WAY TO DO AS OF NOW,

09:47.567 --> 09:48.933
BUT, UH...

09:49.067 --> 09:52.100
AS HAVING ANY KNOWLEDGE
OF THAT CAR BEING STOLEN,

09:52.200 --> 09:53.933
OR WHATNOT, I HAVE
NOT A CLUE ABOUT THAT.

09:54.067 --> 09:56.133
-OKAY. HANG TIGHT.

09:58.733 --> 10:02.900
-IT'S BEEN COMPLETELY PEALED,
AND I FOUND THE IGNITION

10:03.000 --> 10:04.733
UNDERNEATH THE PASSENGER SEAT.

10:06.367 --> 10:08.167
-THE BANDANA TIED AROUND THE--

10:08.267 --> 10:10.667
THEY'LL USE THAT TO
TRY AND HIDE THE PEALED COLUMN.

10:10.767 --> 10:13.900
AS YOU CAN SEE, THE IGNITION'S
ALL THE WAY PUNCHED AND BROKEN
ALL THE WAY OVER TO HERE.

10:16.167 --> 10:20.100
HEY, BROTHER. I UNDERSTAND YOU
TOLD MY PARTNER YOU KNEW
IT WAS A STOLEN CAR.

10:20.200 --> 10:23.333
-WELL, IT'S OBVIOUSLY
A STOLEN CAR, DUDE.
IT'S OBVIOUS.

10:23.433 --> 10:24.667
-IT'S OBVIOUS TO YOU?

10:24.767 --> 10:26.833
I MEAN, YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED
IN A STOLEN CAR BEFORE?

10:26.933 --> 10:28.500
-NO. NEVER.
-NEVER?

10:28.600 --> 10:29.667
THEN HOW IS IT OBVIOUS?

10:29.767 --> 10:32.800
-WELL, IT'S OBVIOUS.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.667
THE STEERING COLUMN'S BROKE...
BROKE, DUDE.

10:34.767 --> 10:36.800
-OKAY, SO TO YOU,
THAT MEANS IT'S A STOLEN CAR.

10:36.900 --> 10:41.167
-WELL, NOT NECESSARILY, BUT, UH,
BUT OBVIOUSLY IT'S STOLEN.

10:41.267 --> 10:44.233
-YOU KNEW THE CAR WAS STOLEN
AND FULL OF PROBABLY
STOLEN PROPERTY.

10:44.333 --> 10:45.967
-NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

10:46.067 --> 10:48.400
THE TOOLS I DID NOT KNOW
WERE STOLEN

10:48.500 --> 10:53.667
UM, LIKE, IN THE CAR, NOT
100 PERCENT KNEW IT WAS STOLEN,
BUT IT WAS CLOSE, DUDE. I--

10:53.767 --> 10:55.900
DUDE, I'M NOT AN IDIOT,
YOU KNOW?
I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.067
-YOU'RE STILL STICKING WITH THAT
HE BROUGHT THE CAR OVER THERE,
AND ASKED YOU TO DRIVE IT?

10:59.167 --> 11:01.767
'CAUSE HE'S SAYING
THE EXACT OPPOSITE, BROTHER.

11:01.867 --> 11:04.467
-THAT'S HIS (bleep) CAR.

11:04.567 --> 11:07.533
-HE'S SAYING YOU SHOWED UP IN IT

11:07.633 --> 11:09.567
THE OTHER DAY OR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
I'M JUST TELLING YOU.

11:09.667 --> 11:12.300
I'M NOT SAYING I BELIEVE HIM,
I JUST WANT TO GET
YOUR TAKE ON IT.

11:12.400 --> 11:15.533
-NOTHING IN THAT CAR IS MINE
EXCEPT FOR MY (bleep) PHONE.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.700
EVERYTHING ELSE IS...
-EVERYTHING ELSE IS HIS?

11:17.800 --> 11:20.800
-HE WAS GOING-- HE WANTED ME
TO DRIVE HIM DOWN SO, UM,

11:20.900 --> 11:25.633
SO, HE COULD (bleep) TURN IN.
HE WANTED TO MAKE SOME MONEY OFF
OF (bleep) OFF OF HIS (bleep)

11:25.733 --> 11:26.833
-HE WANTED WHAT?

11:26.933 --> 11:28.267
HE WANTED TO MAKE
SOME MONEY OFF THIS (bleep)

11:28.367 --> 11:30.800
I WANTED TO MAKE SOME MONEY--
-ALL THE TOOLS?

11:30.900 --> 11:33.267
-AND I WAS GONNA GET
A CUT OUT OF IT,

11:33.367 --> 11:35.567
AND I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
IT WAS GONNA TURN INTO THIS.

11:35.667 --> 11:37.733
-WELL, HOLD TIGHT,
I'M GONNA TALK TO HIM AGAIN.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.100
HEY, LEE, UM...

11:43.200 --> 11:46.167
RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE GONNA GO FREE.
I CAN'T PROVE YOU HAD
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS CAR.

11:46.267 --> 11:48.100
-OKAY.
-IF YOUR PRINTS COME BACK
ON THAT LICENSE PLATE,

11:48.200 --> 11:50.700
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA
BE IN SOME TROUBLE.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.733
UM...
-I HOPE YOU DO TEST
THOSE LICENSE PLATES.

11:52.833 --> 11:54.867
-WHAT'S THAT?
-I HOPE YOU DO TEST
THOSE LICENSE PLATES.

11:54.967 --> 11:56.433
-OKAY. I GOT A STATEMENT
FROM YOU,

11:56.533 --> 11:58.733
SO THERE'S A GOOD
CHANCE YOU'D BE SUBPOENAED
FOR HIS COURT CASE.

11:58.833 --> 12:00.200
-YES, SIR.
-SO, HOP OUT HERE.

12:00.300 --> 12:02.300
I'M GONNA TAKE YOUR CUFFS OFF.

12:04.900 --> 12:06.833
APPRECIATE YOU BEING
COOPERATIVE, NOT RUNNING
FROM THE CAR

12:06.933 --> 12:08.133
OR DOING ANYTHING SQUIRRELLY.

12:08.233 --> 12:09.333
SPREAD YOUR FEET APART.

12:09.433 --> 12:11.067
-GOTTA TAKE THE LIGHT RAIL NOW.

12:11.100 --> 12:13.200
-OKAY, JUST STEP UP
IN FRONT OF THE STORE.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.200
DON'T ENGAGE HIM,
DON'T EVEN TALK TO HIM.

12:18.700 --> 12:19.833
HEY, KEVIN.

12:19.933 --> 12:21.900
SIT UP STRAIGHT, BROTHER.

12:22.067 --> 12:24.700
DID MY PARTNER EXPLAIN ANYTHING,
WHAT'S GOING ON NOW?

12:24.800 --> 12:28.167
-UH, THAT YOU GUYS ARE DRIVING
SO HE GETS SET FREE.

12:28.267 --> 12:30.767
-WELL, THAT'S NOT ALL
IT BOILS DOWN TO.

12:30.867 --> 12:35.800
OKAY, YOU STATED TO ME
AND TO OFFICER LOPEZ HERE

12:35.900 --> 12:37.533
THAT YOU KNEW
IT WAS A STOLEN CAR.

12:37.633 --> 12:39.400
THAT IT WAS OBVIOUS TO YOU.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.767
-I SAID I WASN'T
100% SURE,

12:41.867 --> 12:43.467
BUT YES, I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

12:43.567 --> 12:45.633
I'M NOT GONNA SAY
I KNEW IT WAS STOLEN.
-I KNOW, I KNOW.

12:45.733 --> 12:47.167
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

12:47.267 --> 12:51.367
AND HE'S NOT ADMITTING
TO ANYTHING RELATED TO THAT.

12:51.467 --> 12:53.567
-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
DID YOU GUYS ASK HIM
IF HE KNEW?

12:53.667 --> 12:55.433
-OH, I'VE ASKED HIM
EVERY WHICH WAY.

12:55.533 --> 12:57.933
I TOLD HIM,
"HEY, IF YOU HAD
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS,

12:58.067 --> 13:00.067
"IT'D BE THE WRONG THING
TO DO TO GET KEVIN
IN TROUBLE FOR IT."

13:00.167 --> 13:02.067
AND HE'S DISCLAIMING
ANY KNOWLEDGE.

13:02.167 --> 13:03.600
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT.

13:03.700 --> 13:06.700
-I HAVE A SUSPENDED LICENSE,
SO I SHOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN DRIVING.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.667
-EVERY WHICH WAY
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN DRIVING.

13:08.767 --> 13:11.067
WELL, CONSIDER IT
A LEARNING EXPERIENCE,
ALL RIGHT?

13:11.133 --> 13:13.433
-BUT, LIKE,
THAT'S THE ONLY THING
I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR

13:13.533 --> 13:15.933
IS KNOWING THAT
I SHOULDN'T BE DRIVING
AND I WAS DRIVING.

13:16.067 --> 13:17.300
-ALL RIGHT, KEVIN.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.867
YOU ADMITTED TO IT.
YOU KNEW IT WAS A STOLEN CAR.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.200
-WORKING FOR THE SHERIFF'S
OFFICE, YOU WORK LONG HOURS,

13:24.300 --> 13:26.967
SO YOU NEED TO FIND THINGS
THAT YOU LIKE TO DO ON
YOUR OFF TIME.

13:27.067 --> 13:30.467
SOMETHING THAT I ENJOY DOING
IS COMPETING IN MARATHONS.

13:30.567 --> 13:32.967
IT ALSO KEEPS ME
IN SHAPE FOR MY JOB.

13:33.067 --> 13:35.300
RIGHT NOW, I'M JUST GONNA
CONDUCT A TRAFFIC STOP

13:35.400 --> 13:37.067
ON THIS TRUCK OVER HERE.

13:37.100 --> 13:39.933
HE RAN THE STOP SIGN
WHEN HE WAS LEAVING ONE
OF THE LOCAL HOTELS.

13:40.067 --> 13:41.600
AND HE ALSO DOESN'T
HAVE A TAG LIGHT.

13:41.700 --> 13:43.767
SO, WE'RE JUST GONNA
MAKE CONTACT WITH THE DRIVER.
SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.

13:48.700 --> 13:51.667
NORTH 45, LEE COUNTY,
CAN YOU 65 A 10-50?

13:51.767 --> 13:54.600
BE OUT AT HANCOCK
ON A WHITE SIERRA.

13:54.700 --> 13:57.433
(indistinct radio chatter)

13:57.533 --> 13:59.467
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO.

14:01.233 --> 14:04.433
SIR, COME BACK HERE, THEN!
IF YOU'RE GONNA COME OUT OF
THE CAR, COME OUT OF THE CAR!

14:07.433 --> 14:09.567
GO AHEAD AND STAND
RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY HOOD.

14:09.667 --> 14:11.767
RIGHT OVER HERE.
STAND RIGHT OVER HERE.

14:11.867 --> 14:12.967
(indistinct radio chatter)

14:13.067 --> 14:14.400
-HAVE A SEAT.

14:14.500 --> 14:15.733
-OKAY.

14:15.833 --> 14:19.167
-DO YOU USUALLY GET OUT
OF YOUR CAR ON A TRAFFIC STOP?

14:19.267 --> 14:21.667
-I DON'T USUALLY GET
PULLED OVER, MA'AM.

14:21.767 --> 14:23.967
-OKAY. WHEN YOU--

14:24.067 --> 14:26.333
WHEN I GO AHEAD AND TURN
MY LIGHTS ON, YOU ARE DETAINED.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.133
YOU DO NOT GET OUT
OF YOUR CAR IN A TRAFFIC STOP.

14:28.233 --> 14:30.067
-I WASN'T AWARE.
-DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

14:30.100 --> 14:32.600
-YES, MA'AM, I DO NOW.
-RIGHT. WELL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A SEAT ON MY CAR, ALL RIGHT?

14:32.700 --> 14:34.867
SO, GO AHEAD AND RELAX,
WHY DON'T YOU PUT THAT
CIGARETTE OUT FOR ME, OKAY?

14:34.967 --> 14:36.700
(indistinct radio chatter)

14:37.900 --> 14:41.233
-DON'T GRAB FOR ANYTHING.
JUST HAVE A SEAT, OKAY?

14:41.333 --> 14:42.833
THE REASON WHY
I STOPPED YOU,

14:42.933 --> 14:44.667
YOU WERE COMING OUT
OF THAT MOTEL

14:44.767 --> 14:48.067
AND THERE'S A STOP SIGN
RIGHT THERE, RIGHT BEFORE
YOU COME OUT ONTO MARINATOWN,

14:48.100 --> 14:49.433
AND YOU DID NOT STOP
AT THE STOP SIGN.

14:49.533 --> 14:50.700
-I DIDN'T STOP COMPLETELY?

14:50.800 --> 14:52.400
YOU DID NOT STOP
AT ALL.

14:52.500 --> 14:53.700
OKAY?

14:53.800 --> 14:56.433
(indistinct radio chatter)

14:56.533 --> 14:57.667
-KEEP YOUR HANDS
OUT OF YOUR POCKETS.

14:57.767 --> 14:59.367
-I HAVE A POCKET KNIFE
IN MY RIGHT POCKET.

14:59.467 --> 15:01.733
-OKAY, THAT'S WHY I'M TELLING
YOU TO KEEP YOUR HANDS OUT
OF YOUR POCKETS.

15:01.833 --> 15:02.767
-OKAY, YES, MA'AM.

15:02.867 --> 15:03.900
-NORTH 45, LEE COUNTY,

15:04.067 --> 15:07.100
CAN I HAVE SOMEONE BE 51'D
TO MY LOCATION?

15:07.200 --> 15:08.533
ARE YOU STAYING OVER
AT THE HOTEL?

15:08.633 --> 15:10.067
-NO, I'M NOT.

15:10.133 --> 15:13.267
I STOPPED AT MCDONALDS
AND GOT A SWEET TEA,
-UH-HUH.

15:13.367 --> 15:17.067
AND THERE WAS A COUPLE PEOPLE
THERE THAT I KNOW THAT STAY
OVER AT THE NIGHT'S INN,

15:17.167 --> 15:18.833
I DROPPED THEM OFF,
PULLED OUT,

15:18.933 --> 15:20.633
CAME RIGHT BACK OUT
THIS WAY.

15:20.733 --> 15:23.167
I WAS MAKING A U-TURN BECAUSE
I LIVE UP AT THE END OF
HANCOCK BRIDGE PARKWAY.

15:23.267 --> 15:25.300
-OKAY. WERE YOU IN
THE HOSPITAL TODAY?

15:25.400 --> 15:26.933
-I WAS IN
THE EMERGENCY ROOM, YES.

15:27.067 --> 15:30.233
-FOR WHAT?
-I HAVE HEPATITIS C,
CHRONIC PANCREATITIS,

15:30.333 --> 15:31.700
-OKAY.
-DIVERTICULITIS,

15:31.800 --> 15:33.133
COLITIS,
-OKAY.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.733
-I HAVE ALL KINDS OF ISSUES
WITH MY ABDOMEN.
-ALL RIGHT.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.733
BESIDES YOUR POCKET KNIFE,
DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER WEAPONS
OR ANYTHING ON YOU?

15:40.833 --> 15:42.200
-NO.
-OKAY. WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO

15:42.300 --> 15:43.833
IS I WANT YOU TO PUT
YOUR HANDS ON THE CAR.

15:43.933 --> 15:45.167
ALL RIGHT.

15:45.267 --> 15:47.367
WITHOUT REACHING FOR IT,
WHERE IS THE POCKET KNIFE AT?

15:47.467 --> 15:49.067
-IN MY RIGHT, FRONT POCKET.

15:49.100 --> 15:51.767
-AND YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
PULLED OVER BEFORE?

15:51.867 --> 15:53.900
-OH, I'VE BEEN PULLED OVER
BEFORE, BUT NOT REGULARLY.

15:54.067 --> 15:56.100
-OKAY, IT DOES LOOK
A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS...

15:56.200 --> 15:57.433
-OF COURSE IT DOES.

15:57.533 --> 15:59.533
-...THAT YOU KIND OF EXITED
THE VEHICLE VERY QUICKLY,

15:59.633 --> 16:01.133
WALKED TOWARDS ME--

16:01.233 --> 16:02.500
-THAT WAS JUST COURTESY.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.300
-NO, NO. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.167
I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT, SIR.

16:06.267 --> 16:08.933
RIGHT. GO AND HAVE A SEAT.

16:09.067 --> 16:10.600
UM, DAVID,
HERE'S THE DEAL.

16:10.700 --> 16:12.333
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ILLEGAL
INSIDE THE VEHICLE?

16:12.433 --> 16:14.433
-NO.
-DO YOU MIND IF
I SEARCH THE VEHICLE?

16:14.533 --> 16:16.067
-WHY DO YOU NEED
TO SEARCH MY VEHICLE?

16:16.167 --> 16:17.800
-I'M JUST ASKING YOU
THE QUESTION.

16:17.900 --> 16:20.267
YOU ARE MORE THAN WELCOME
TO DENY CONSENT.

16:20.367 --> 16:21.867
IF YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO SEARCH THE VEHICLE--

16:21.967 --> 16:23.200
-I DON'T WANT ANYBODY
SEARCHING MY VEHICLE.

16:23.300 --> 16:24.733
-OKAY.
-I MEAN, THERE'S
NOTHING IN THERE.

16:24.833 --> 16:27.300
-OKAY.
-IF THERE WAS POT OR ANYTHING
YOU COULD HAVE SMELLED IT

16:27.400 --> 16:29.333
WHEN YOU WALKED IN.
-RIGHT. SO, I'M ASKING YOU,

16:29.433 --> 16:30.667
CAN I SEARCH THE VEHICLE
OR NOT?

16:30.767 --> 16:32.567
-NO! THERE'S NO REASON
TO SEARCH MY VEHICLE.
-OKAY.

16:32.667 --> 16:33.867
THAT'S NO PROBLEM.

16:33.967 --> 16:34.967
-GOOD GRIEF.

16:35.067 --> 16:38.367
(dog barking)

16:38.467 --> 16:41.767
-ALL RIGHT. SO, RIGHT NOW,
WE CALLED THE K9 DEPUTY

16:41.867 --> 16:45.333
TO COME AND DO AN OPEN AIR
SNIFF OF THE VEHICLE.

16:45.433 --> 16:48.333
TO SEE IF THE DOG ALERTS
TO ANY SCENTS OF NARCOTICS.

16:48.433 --> 16:51.267
SO, HE'LL BRING THE DOG AROUND
THE CAR AND SEE IF
WE SEE ANYTHING.

16:56.367 --> 16:57.600
-THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE.

16:57.700 --> 16:59.300
YOU CAN STICK YOUR HEAD
IN THERE,

16:59.400 --> 17:01.833
THERE'S NO POT
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
IN THERE, SIR.

17:02.933 --> 17:04.167
-AND THAT WAS A YES.

17:04.267 --> 17:05.567
THAT WAS A YES.
-NO.

17:05.667 --> 17:08.233
I'VE HAD PEOPLE IN THE BACK
OF MY CAR THAT ARE BASICALLY--

17:08.333 --> 17:10.500
MY TRUCK ,
THAT ARE BASICALLY HOMELESS

17:10.600 --> 17:12.767
THAT HAD THEIR CLOTHES
AND STUFF IN THERE.

17:12.867 --> 17:15.467
BUT, I MEAN IT'S--
-WE'RE GONNA CHECK TO MAKE SURE
THERE'S NO DRUGS.

17:15.567 --> 17:18.367
THERE'S NOTHING THAT WE SHOULD
BE CONCERNED ABOUT, LIKE
NEEDLES OR ANYTHING, RIGHT, SIR?

17:18.467 --> 17:19.633
-NO. NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE.

17:19.733 --> 17:20.967
NO, SIR,
THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE.

17:21.067 --> 17:22.700
-OKAY.
-THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE
THAT BELONGS TO ME,

17:22.800 --> 17:24.633
I CAN DAMN SURE GUARANTEE
YOU THAT.
-OKAY.

17:24.733 --> 17:26.833
-HE SAYS HE WAS
DROPPING FRIENDS OFF.

17:26.933 --> 17:31.067
THERE'S NO WAY THAT ANYONE
SAT IN THAT BACK SEAT AS MUCH
CRAP THAT HE HAS BACK THERE.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.200
RIGHT NOW,

17:34.300 --> 17:36.933
BECAUSE THE K9 ALERTED TO THERE
BEING A SCENT OF NARCOTICS
INSIDE THE VEHICLE,

17:37.067 --> 17:38.533
WE'RE GONNA SEARCH THE VEHICLE

17:38.633 --> 17:42.567
AND ACTUALLY TRY TO FIND
WHERE THE NARCOTICS ARE
INSIDE THE CAR.

17:42.667 --> 17:44.900
WE'RE TRYING TO JUST MAKE SURE.
IT LOOKED LIKE THERE
ARE SOME BAGGIES,

17:45.067 --> 17:46.800
BUT I'M NOT SURE.
GIVE ME A SECOND.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.067
HEY, UM, LOCK,
IN THE FRONT

17:49.167 --> 17:50.933
WE'VE GOT...
-YEAH, THAT'S NOT--

17:51.067 --> 17:53.367
-ONE, TWO, THREE,
FOUR, FIVE NEEDLES

17:53.467 --> 17:54.867
AND NUMEROUS BAGGIES.

17:54.967 --> 17:56.367
JUST BY THE BROWNISH TINT,

17:56.467 --> 17:58.733
THIS LOOKS LIKE
HEROIN TO ME.

17:58.833 --> 18:00.200
YEAH?
-YEAH, CHECK THAT,

18:00.300 --> 18:02.433
BUT, YEAH,
THAT'S NOT HOSPITAL STUFF.

18:02.533 --> 18:05.200
STUFF UP HERE.
-YEAH.

18:05.300 --> 18:08.900
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE JUST GONNA
TEST THE RESIDUE INSIDE
THE BAGGIES

18:09.067 --> 18:11.400
TO SEE IF IT COMES OUT
POSITIVE FOR HEROIN.

18:11.500 --> 18:15.133
THERE'S A GOOD AMOUNT
OF RESIDUE INSIDE NUMEROUS,
NUMEROUS BAGGIES.

18:15.233 --> 18:17.767
-RESIDUE HERE.
SO WE CAN SWAB ALL THIS.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.733
-AND SO THAT'S GONNA BE
POSITIVE FOR HEROIN.

18:22.833 --> 18:24.167
(indistinct radio chatter)

18:24.267 --> 18:26.367
-DAVID, DO YOU UNDERSTAND
HOW BAD THAT LOOKS?

18:26.467 --> 18:29.233
OKAY. SO YOU GAVE YOUR FRIENDS
A RIDE OVER TO THE HOTEL.

18:29.333 --> 18:32.800
DID THEY COME INTO YOUR CAR
WITH STUFF, OR WHAT HAPPENED?

18:32.900 --> 18:36.133
-THEY BEEN IN AND OUT
OF MY TRUCK ON A COUPLE
OF DIFFERENT OCCASIONS,

18:36.233 --> 18:37.567
LIKE I TOLD YOU.

18:37.667 --> 18:39.333
I'VE LET--
-AND EVERY TIME THEY BRING
STUFF INTO YOUR CAR?

18:39.433 --> 18:41.100
-NO, NOT EVERY TIME.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.967
-OKAY, I'M TALKING ABOUT
THIS TIME. WHEN YOU PICKED
THEM UP AT THE MCDONALD'S,

18:43.067 --> 18:45.333
DID THEY BRING STUFF
INTO YOUR CAR THIS TIME?

18:45.433 --> 18:49.100
-THEY HAD STUFF ON THEM,
BUT THEY DIDN'T LEAVE ANYTHING
THAT I KNOW OF

18:49.200 --> 18:50.700
BESIDES WHAT THEY'D
ALREADY LEFT.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.400
-OKAY, SO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME

18:52.500 --> 18:54.900
THAT WHEN WE SEARCHED
THIS CAR, OKAY,

18:55.067 --> 18:59.733
WE FIND NEEDLES, OBVIOUSLY,
INSIDE THE VEHICLE.

18:59.833 --> 19:02.833
YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THAT'S
BEEN INSIDE YOUR CAR FOR
A WHILE NOW,

19:02.933 --> 19:04.100
THE LAST TIME THEY GOT
IN THE CAR,

19:04.200 --> 19:06.067
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T BRING
THAT STUFF IN TODAY?

19:06.167 --> 19:08.433
-I DON'T KNOW WHEN
IT WAS PUT INTO MY TRUCK.

19:08.533 --> 19:09.967
I DON'T KNOW WHAT--

19:10.067 --> 19:13.300
HE SAID A BLACK BAG.
I DON'T KNOW OF ANY
BLACK BAG IN MY TRUCK.

19:13.400 --> 19:17.300
-OKAY. DO YOU NORMALLY DRIVE
AROUND WITH NARCOTICS
AND PARAPHERNALIA IN YOUR CAR?

19:17.400 --> 19:18.800
-NO! OF COURSE NOT!

19:18.900 --> 19:19.833
-WELL, YOU HAVE BEEN.

19:19.933 --> 19:21.500
YOU'VE GOT SYRINGES,

19:21.600 --> 19:25.333
NUMEROUS DIME-SIZED BAGGIES
WITH HEROIN RESIDUE IN IT,

19:25.433 --> 19:27.067
YOU'RE THE REGISTERED
OWNER OF THAT VEHICLE,

19:27.100 --> 19:28.800
AND YOU'RE THE SOLE OCCUPANT.

19:28.900 --> 19:30.433
SO GO AHEAD
AND HAVE A SEAT FOR ME.

19:33.133 --> 19:36.100
IT PROBABLY IS NOT THE SMARTEST
THING TO BE GIVING RANDOM
PEOPLE A RIDE

19:36.200 --> 19:38.800
AND LETTING THEM LEAVE
THEIR RANDOM STUFF IN THE BACK
OF YOUR CAR.

19:38.900 --> 19:43.200
YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH
A STORAGE SHED FOR
THE JUNKIES OF NORTH FORT MYERS.

19:43.300 --> 19:45.633
YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO JAIL
FOR THE POSSESSION OF HEROIN,

19:45.733 --> 19:47.867
AND THE POSSESSION
OF PARAPHERNALIA.

19:48.967 --> 19:49.933
-Officer over radio:
132 AND BUSH.

19:50.067 --> 19:51.667
I'VE GOT HIM AT GUNPOINT.

19:51.767 --> 19:53.433
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, GUNPOINT, 132 AND BUSH.

19:53.533 --> 19:54.467
COVER IS CODE THREE.

19:54.567 --> 19:57.433
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:02.900 --> 20:04.833
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, WE'LL STILL SEND
A CODE THREE.

20:04.933 --> 20:06.400
-(theme music playing)
