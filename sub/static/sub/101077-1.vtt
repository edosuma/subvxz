-Stace, please, no social, come on.
-What? But you look so--

03:22.202 --> 03:24.705
I’m not into having a thing, guys!
Seriously, okay?

03:24.830 --> 03:27.249
You have not been any fun
since like sixth grade,

03:27.749 --> 03:29.126
except this one time with this robe.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.586
My parents are home in 12 hours.
You guys realize that, right?

03:31.753 --> 03:33.296
Dude, that's what we were just saying.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.341
-What? That I'm not having a thing?
-No. That that gives us...

-What?

04:13.712 --> 04:16.006
-Hey!

-Hey, Kayla.
-Hey!

04:42.199 --> 04:44.993
Hey, I'm just rifling through your stuff.

04:45.952 --> 04:46.870
Really?

04:48.371 --> 04:50.499
I'm joking. I'm just waiting
in line for the bathroom.

04:51.166 --> 04:52.125
There's not--

04:53.376 --> 04:55.545
No one’s in there. There's not even a line
if you wanna just--

04:56.671 --> 04:59.674
-just go in there.
-Right. Guess I’m busted.

05:00.217 --> 05:01.343

Look, I found this and I was, like,
wow, it's us! Remember cotillion?

05:08.391 --> 05:09.726
Yeah. I don't know why that's there.

05:10.852 --> 05:13.021
-Random.
-[Kayla] I loved it.

05:17.442 --> 05:20.445
-I thought it was perfect.
-Yeah. Me too.

05:22.197 --> 05:23.365
Really? You?

05:24.825 --> 05:26.827
No. Actually, no. I...

05:27.911 --> 05:30.330
You know, I mean, I thought it was cool,
it was fun.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.917
-You were super cool. [chuckles]
-Me?

05:36.962 --> 05:38.463
You always were a little gentleman.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.800
Always thought you'd ask me to a dance
or something when we got older.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.054
You thought that?

05:47.472 --> 05:50.016
I ended up skipping
most of the dances anyway. You?

05:50.559 --> 05:55.564
Yeah, no, yeah. No dances for me.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.316
Never thought you'd be the guy
that'd throw a party.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.778
Oh. It's not really my party,
right, or even...

06:03.280 --> 06:06.157
a party at all. It's just my--
Like, everybody else's.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.035
At your house.

06:10.036 --> 06:13.081
Yeah, yeah. At my house, yeah.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.253
Maybe you do have a wild side
despite what everyone else says.

06:18.420 --> 06:21.214
-What?
-Oh. Hey, girl. You're good?

06:21.339 --> 06:22.257
Hey.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.677
Tell Clint to meet me
in your parents' room?

06:26.386 --> 06:27.262
What?

06:27.387 --> 06:29.389
Tell Clint to meet me
in your parents' room?

06:29.472 --> 06:31.725
No. No, Stacy. No, that's off limits!

06:31.850 --> 06:34.144
[Stacy] God, dude!
Just focus on what's in your room.

06:59.461 --> 07:02.631
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

07:02.756 --> 07:07.636
-Life defining moment. Take note.
-Please, just do this?

I-- Hold on a second. Hold on. [sighs]

07:12.515 --> 07:17.145
Brett, I just want to say
I want to raise a glass.

07:17.854 --> 07:20.690
You've done everything right
in your 17 years.

07:20.899 --> 07:23.610
You've set yourself up
for all the blessings that lie ahead.

-Thank you, Marheem Tutorials.

-[chuckles] ...1590 on your SAT...
-Thank you, Infinite Futures Prep course.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.666
Oh. It's that one missed question
that just sort of, toys with you--

07:37.749 --> 07:41.211
Okay, but, but national recognition
in clarinet. Reed instrument.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.171
That was a very strategic thing
on our part.

07:43.296 --> 07:48.301
Exactly. It's like I've always said,
becoming one’s true best self...

07:48.927 --> 07:52.013
achieving one’s potential,
that is success.

07:52.222 --> 07:54.627
And with success comes freedom.
And with freedom comes

-all the great things--
-[Brett] Dad!

-We got into Cornell.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.377
We're going to Cornell.
We're going to Cornell.

08:13.527 --> 08:15.211
Okay. Next up, come on.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.124
Oh, God. We're into Yale.
We're going to Yale! We're into to Yale!

08:30.093 --> 08:32.595
Brown! Okay, click on the last one.
It's Harvard, click on the last one.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.139
Right there. Click on it.

08:36.558 --> 08:40.603
Oh, my-- Oh, wait.
You're wait-listed at Harvard.

08:40.729 --> 08:42.272
-What?
-[Kristen] But Harvard.

Hey, come on! Seven out of eight.
That's amazing! What are we batting?

08:48.987 --> 08:52.449
-Eight seventy-five.

There, there are those math skills
at work right there. Congratulations!

09:04.711 --> 09:06.337
-Wassup, dude?
-[Clint] Yo, wassup?

09:10.300 --> 09:13.970
-Is she new?
-Dude, don't give him the satisfaction.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.140
-I can't just, like, ghost him.
-Yes, you can.

09:17.265 --> 09:20.518
Just, like, swipe left on the entire
disturbing scenario, all right?

09:22.395 --> 09:24.481
Do they, do they just stake out
the house? Like, I--

09:24.689 --> 09:28.151
-Basically, yes. What'd you hear?
-It doesn't matter, man.

09:28.777 --> 09:30.111
Whoa. Bad?

09:32.113 --> 09:35.158
-Tell me or you walk.
-All right, man. Just on the DL.

09:35.325 --> 09:37.619
-Why?
-I just don't wanna to be that guy.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.371
-What guy?
-The guy that got into Cornell.

09:41.164 --> 09:45.502
And Yale and Columbia. And Dartmouth,
Penn, Brown and Princeton.

09:47.629 --> 09:51.049
Dude, you're shitting me?
That's like every one of them.

09:51.549 --> 09:54.177
-Not Harvard. Wait-listed.
-Oh!

09:54.844 --> 09:55.804
So, a loser.

09:56.179 --> 09:57.722
You're just lucky
you committed for ball, man.

09:57.889 --> 10:00.558
Didn't have to deal
with all the weirdness of it.

10:00.725 --> 10:04.771
Okay, bro, you just hit a walk-off homer.
Do not complain about the trot.

10:11.402 --> 10:16.282
-Don't ask, not discussing.
-Wisco and Tulane? Come on!

-He went seven for eight.

10:23.248 --> 10:26.292
That's sick!
Okay, but which one dissed you?

10:26.960 --> 10:29.462
-Harvard. Listed.
-Wow.

10:29.963 --> 10:33.758
Listed at Harvard. Loser, right?
Complete...

10:33.883 --> 10:35.635
-I mean, rank.
-Pure.

10:35.802 --> 10:36.886
-Consummate.
-Unmitigated.

10:37.011 --> 10:38.429
All right. God, I get it.

10:39.139 --> 10:42.433
You're gonna clear Wisco or Tulane, man.
No JC with your scores.

10:43.059 --> 10:48.439
I dunno. GPA jacks me.
Absences jack me. The world is jacking me.

10:49.065 --> 10:51.693
Yo, Nick, how many ethnicity boxes
did you check on the app?

10:51.943 --> 10:55.697
-Four. Plus other.

-And they called the local news station,

11:44.829 --> 11:46.664
they're throwing a party
for their friends.

Okay, the news station,
that's kind of weird.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.084
-Yeah.
-But at least, it'll all be over soon

Yeah, pretty much.

-So, I blew high school?
-What do you mean, "you blew high school?"

12:02.555 --> 12:04.933
I don't know, I mean that
you said that you thought

12:05.016 --> 12:07.560
I would never throw a party
and that I might have a wild side--

12:07.685 --> 12:09.896
Joking! Joking, hi. Remember that?

12:12.232 --> 12:14.734
Like, who cares what people think anyways?

12:15.068 --> 12:16.819
Well, not me. Obviously.

12:20.698 --> 12:21.783
You really don't, do you?

-Care what anybody else thinks.
-Is it that obvious?

12:27.747 --> 12:30.541

-Uh. Yeah, I got into my top two.
-That's awesome. Where?

12:37.924 --> 12:40.677
It doesn't matter, anyways.
I can't afford either, so.

12:41.302 --> 12:45.723
-You could apply for aid or something.
-I'm coming up with another plan.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.769
-Okay, is it top secret?
-Maybe.

12:50.436 --> 12:51.688
Maybe not.

12:52.814 --> 12:53.856
Depends.

-Come on.

14:12.435 --> 14:14.437
Twice a week.
Says has some sort of system.

14:15.772 --> 14:16.939
[Brett] Might be genius.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.524
-Hey, Dee.
-[Dee] What up, fellas?

14:18.649 --> 14:21.319
-[Nico] Rollin’ into summer, Dee.
-Thank you, thank you.

14:22.320 --> 14:25.239
-[coins clank]
-Hey, hey, hey! Guys, guys, guys!

14:25.365 --> 14:27.216
I just wanna make sure
that we're still on for tonight.

14:27.408 --> 14:30.119
-I worked my ass off on this thing.
-Of course, are you kidding?

14:30.453 --> 14:32.163
-A 1,000 percent.
-Thank you.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.332
I have a chem project.

14:34.791 --> 14:39.712
Oh! Come on, dude. The race is over.
You won by like a billion miles.

14:40.004 --> 14:43.341
BB, please, come on!
No more wasting formative years.

14:43.466 --> 14:47.470
Dude, it's one senior prank night
your entire life, Brett Blackmore.

14:48.096 --> 14:49.806
-You don’t skip it.
-Right?

14:50.515 --> 14:51.808
I mean, like, come on! Fuck it.

14:51.933 --> 14:55.770
[Brett] <i>Right there. You hear that?</i>
<i>Those two words?</i>

14:57.188 --> 14:59.190
<i>By themselves, relatively harmless.</i>

14:59.732 --> 15:01.359
<i>Put them together</i>
<i>and they're life changing.</i>

15:02.276 --> 15:04.445
<i>I didn't know that yet,</i>
<i>I was too busy thinking</i>

15:04.904 --> 15:08.533
<i>they were right. Maybe for once</i>
<i>I should just let go and say...</i>

15:09.784 --> 15:13.663
-All right, maybe.
-Well. Way to fully commit.

15:15.331 --> 15:20.753
-Was it worth it? Absolutely. Come on!
-And to think you had it all figured out.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.214
Had we known,
none of us would've helped him, right?

15:23.840 --> 15:25.842
Am I right? Hey, buddy. I love you!

15:26.634 --> 15:28.177
Congrats to the Blackmores.

15:28.288 --> 15:30.188
-Congrats to the Blackmores.
-Congrats to the Blackmores.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.557
-Well done! Well played.
-Than you, thank you. Come on.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.894
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

15:37.478 --> 15:39.730
When ours go through it,
I will be belly up in Cabo.

15:39.897 --> 15:42.692
-Drink in hand.
-This one, double-fisted.

15:43.693 --> 15:45.111
[Suzanne] They can do it themselves.

15:46.404 --> 15:48.781
‘Course it helps
that they’re already in, so to speak.

15:49.657 --> 15:50.533
They’re in middle school.

15:51.075 --> 15:53.411
Well, if Barry keeps his ass
on the advisory board,

15:53.494 --> 15:56.497
-I can keep mine in Cabo.
-[Barry] What an ass she has.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.084
Listen, don’t beat yourself up.

16:00.209 --> 16:04.338
Harvard is very difficult
for non-legacies, it’s hardly fair.

16:04.672 --> 16:08.301
Hey, guys, I'm really sorry. I mean,
I don't know what happened. I pushed.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.387
-Really, Barry? How hard?
-Hard, very hard.

16:11.929 --> 16:14.724
Didn't Dean Reilly personally invite you
to sit on the board?

16:14.807 --> 16:16.809
Yeah. Aren't you guys
close personal friends?

16:17.101 --> 16:19.395
It's Harvard. They go their own way.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.231
Look, he made on the waitlist.
I'm sure he'll clear it.

16:22.356 --> 16:26.027
-He’s a wonderful young man.
-Yeah, well, you can thank us for that.

16:27.111 --> 16:29.739
Where do you think he’s sitting
on the wait list? One? Two?

16:29.947 --> 16:32.200
-Maybe three.
-Sadly, it doesn’t matter.

16:32.283 --> 16:34.619
Nobody who gets into Harvard doesn't go.

16:35.036 --> 16:36.787
I didn't know that. Really?

16:37.079 --> 16:39.916
What do us state-school girls know
about this Ivy league thing?

16:40.625 --> 16:43.211
Oh, my God! It's all I can say.

16:44.795 --> 16:47.447
[Doug] Well, what are you doing stuffing
Adderall in that kid's burgers or what?

16:47.647 --> 16:50.042
-[Jeffrey] Hell yeah. Aren't we all?
-[Leslie] We should be.

16:50.927 --> 16:51.844
[man] Sweet.

16:52.053 --> 16:56.349
You need to capitalize on this.
I mean, a book, a blog, I don't know what.

16:59.602 --> 17:02.160
Brett, honey, why aren't you coming down?
Everybody wants to see you.

17:02.230 --> 17:03.706
-Mom--
-[Kristen] These people have known you

17:03.931 --> 17:06.359
since you were a baby.
Five minutes. Say hello.

17:06.817 --> 17:09.487
Make Suzanne Brooks feel
completely inferior as a parent.

17:10.279 --> 17:13.574
-You know I hate her.
-Maybe. I have a chem project due.

17:13.824 --> 17:15.201
[game controller buttons clicking]

17:15.743 --> 17:17.286
Okay, well, before everyone leaves.

17:18.621 --> 17:19.580
Especially her.

17:33.678 --> 17:36.973
[Stacy] Whoa, whoa. Okay, so this is 31-A.
It has to interlock with B.

17:37.098 --> 17:40.518
Hey, no climbing on it though, right?
And I can't have it falling or anything.

17:40.601 --> 17:43.282
Donnie. Come on, okay. I designed it.
Personally designed it.

17:43.832 --> 17:44.897
Who gonna take all this down?

17:45.022 --> 17:47.817
Well, that’s kinda the point, here, Donny.
Hey, you want some more pizza?

17:48.067 --> 17:50.069
-Do I look like an idiot to you?
-No.

17:50.528 --> 17:52.989
-Of course I want more pizza.
-Good.

17:54.657 --> 17:56.826
-Stace, this looks awesome.
-I know, right?

17:57.285 --> 18:00.538
-Awesome. Look, are they...
-Oh.

18:02.582 --> 18:03.457
Yup.

18:04.208 --> 18:08.796
[Nico] Okay. Okay. Yeah.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.218
[Les laughing]

18:17.471 --> 18:18.931
The inner sanctum.

18:20.558 --> 18:21.934
Attention peons under my command.

18:22.059 --> 18:23.477
-Can you do it?
-It's gonna be great.

18:24.895 --> 18:28.149
Whoa! The inner inner sanctum.

18:34.530 --> 18:37.325
It's all here.
Where are my parent's grades?

18:42.204 --> 18:43.456
Shit.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.208
-Yo, Les, what are you doing?
-[Les] Is that...

18:50.087 --> 18:53.174
-Dude, is my voice higher now?
-That's gas! What the fuck, Les?

18:53.299 --> 18:55.384
Oh my God, stop-- stop it. Stop the gas!

18:56.093 --> 18:57.970
-How do you shut this off?
-Just shut it off!

18:58.220 --> 18:59.180
I'm trying!

18:59.430 --> 19:01.057
-[Nico] Shit. Shit. Shit.
-We need help!

19:01.140 --> 19:03.684
-Okay. I'm gonna get help!
-[Les] Huh.

19:04.518 --> 19:05.519
Epic.

19:06.312 --> 19:09.607
I think my voice is lower now,
instead of higher.

19:09.774 --> 19:11.692
-Get down!
-[Stacy] Yeah.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.569
You said no climbing!

19:13.653 --> 19:15.529
I did. It's just some selfies though,
so chill.

19:16.113 --> 19:19.617
-Oh, hey, there you are.
-Hey, hey. We need you. Now. Now!

19:23.297 --> 19:25.873
-So, why does it smell like gas in here?
-Just put your shirt over your mouth.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.086
-Hey.
-Hey.

19:32.421 --> 19:33.422
Are these rubbers?

19:34.632 --> 19:38.094
-Is he like a porn star?
-My dad gets them by the case,

19:38.177 --> 19:42.223
-who the fuck cares? Tell us what to do?
-Open the windows, now! All of them. Go!

19:42.306 --> 19:43.891
-[Nico] Dude, none of those open!
-[Brett] Go!

19:44.016 --> 19:46.686
-[Nico] Brett, none of those open!
-[Brett] Doors! Open everything. Go.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.938
We are so screwed. We are so--

19:51.482 --> 19:52.775
What the fuck are you doing, man?

19:52.900 --> 19:55.194
I thought we could do whatever we want
as long as we save the school?

19:55.611 --> 19:59.031
Guys, I can't do this.
I'm getting really dizzy.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.200
We gotta get out of here. We gotta--
Come on!

20:02.743 --> 20:03.953
Hurry up, come on!

20:07.623 --> 20:08.624
Come on, man!

20:15.047 --> 20:15.965
[man] Yeah!

20:19.135 --> 20:20.094
You know what's happening?

20:23.097 --> 20:24.724
Cold air is pouring in those windows
right now.

20:25.182 --> 20:27.601
[air hissing]

20:28.686 --> 20:33.524
<i>And that pushes lighter methane up</i>
<i>packing it tighter and tighter.</i>

20:36.360 --> 20:38.070
<i>The cold air makes the temperature</i>
<i>in the room drop</i>

20:38.195 --> 20:39.447
<i>which makes the gas settle...</i>

20:41.282 --> 20:43.451
<i>which pushes out more of the diffused air.</i>

20:46.412 --> 20:47.830
But what really matters is...

20:48.664 --> 20:49.540
the temperature drop.

20:49.812 --> 20:51.409
Okay. You're freaking me out.
I'm gonna call--

20:51.484 --> 20:55.062
Because it's just gonna get colder
and colder in there until something...

20:57.006 --> 20:58.132
ignites...

20:59.800 --> 21:00.885
and then...

21:03.637 --> 21:04.847
I'm so fucked!

21:21.530 --> 21:24.408
[Legere] <i>An interesting turn of events</i>
<i>in Pacific Palisades.</i>

21:24.658 --> 21:27.745
<i>Brett Blackmore,</i>
<i>who made local news yesterday</i>

21:27.995 --> 21:31.248
<i>with acceptances</i>
<i>into multiple exclusive colleges</i>

21:31.540 --> 21:35.336
<i>today is suspected of blowing up</i>
<i>his high school's administration building.</i>

21:35.461 --> 21:37.313
<i>-</i>[doorbell rings]
<i>-</i>[Legere] <i>Stay tuned for more updates</i>

21:37.454 --> 21:38.998
<i>with Channel Six news.</i>

21:41.300 --> 21:44.136
We did manage to pull a frame off
the melted security cam drive.

21:44.428 --> 21:46.931
-Well, it’s fuzzy.
-But obvious.

21:50.559 --> 21:54.188
-Look, it was just a prank.
-The picnic tables weren't the real prank?

21:56.273 --> 21:58.442
Yes, but we did data entry
during free and--

21:58.692 --> 21:59.693
"We" being?

22:00.861 --> 22:04.782
Like, a lot of people did data entry
during free for community service credits,

22:04.865 --> 22:06.075
and I know how to run the computers.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.160
So there were others
with you in the office?

22:09.620 --> 22:11.664
No. It was just me. I already said that.

22:13.254 --> 22:15.084
It was just me
and I know how to run the computers.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.877
I was gonna go into the office
and I was just--

22:17.795 --> 22:20.548
And just do this portal thing
and give all the seniors straight A's.

22:21.006 --> 22:24.844
All by yourself. No help.
This was completely your idea?

22:24.969 --> 22:25.970
All by myself.

22:26.428 --> 22:28.681
[Jeffrey] Well, that--
that doesn't even sound credible

22:28.848 --> 22:30.599
that you could do this on your own.

22:30.724 --> 22:32.810
Honey, this could impact
the rest of your life.

22:32.893 --> 22:36.063
This could change everything for--
Well, for all of us.

22:37.523 --> 22:38.524
I know that.

22:43.445 --> 22:44.572
Is that all of them?

22:45.489 --> 22:46.490
All seven.

22:48.701 --> 22:49.577
Three hours.

22:49.702 --> 22:52.037
But they all said
"to be reviewed at a later time".

22:52.121 --> 22:54.748
Yes, that's polite-speak
for "not a chance in hell."

22:56.500 --> 23:00.254
I have to cancel my book proposal meeting.
Oh, and those blog people...

23:00.796 --> 23:02.923
What were you thinking?

23:09.346 --> 23:11.223
-I'm going to Clint's.
-Oh, no, no, no, no.

23:11.307 --> 23:13.142
Okay, yeah. That's good.
Maybe that’s good.

23:13.267 --> 23:15.936
Just check in with us, okay?
Often. Please?

23:18.981 --> 23:20.816
-We didn't hear from Harvard.
-He's wait-listed.

23:20.941 --> 23:21.984
They're not even gonna bother.

23:22.067 --> 23:24.820
Well, then, we need to go to Barry
and we need to throw ourselves at him.

23:24.945 --> 23:26.822
We already did, okay?
He did everything he could.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.949
-You heard what he said.
-He wasn’t properly motivated.

23:29.033 --> 23:30.951
If he was properly motivated,
he'd do more.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.328
[Jeffery sighs]

23:35.080 --> 23:36.707
He's always had a thing for me,
you know that.

23:39.001 --> 23:42.588
What? Are you talking
about the Jacuzzi thing in Palm Springs?

23:42.713 --> 23:45.299
-That was an accident.
-No, that was no accident.

23:47.801 --> 23:51.430
-Are you seriously suggesting--
-That we do anything to rectify this?

23:52.056 --> 23:54.558
For our son? For us?

23:55.684 --> 23:58.729
You want to throw away 18 years,
not to mention the nine months

23:58.812 --> 24:02.316
of bodily sacrifice I made,
to come up short?

24:04.526 --> 24:09.448
So-- so, you're offering yourself
so our kid can go to college--

24:09.531 --> 24:14.078
I am suggesting
that we properly motivate him.

24:14.536 --> 24:18.248
-That’s it. End of sentence.
-So you're offering yourself.

24:18.415 --> 24:20.542
Oh, my God. Yes, I am offering. That's--

24:21.919 --> 24:23.337
You got it.

24:23.712 --> 24:27.132
What are the odds that yours
is literally the only photo

24:27.216 --> 24:29.593
-they retrieved off the camera?
-Pretty shitty.

24:30.344 --> 24:33.138
-Hey, you wanna know the actual math?
-Are they pressing you?

24:33.597 --> 24:34.890
That doesn't matter, man.

24:35.516 --> 24:38.352
I'm not tanking your ride.
Or getting Nico's wait-list tossed.

24:39.311 --> 24:41.605
Dude, you do not have to do that.
We were all there. All right?

24:41.730 --> 24:44.984
Come on. You guys would have done
the same for me. You all would.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.612
[Stacy] <i>Ticking down. Then we’re off</i>
<i>to separate schools.</i>

24:48.779 --> 24:50.614
[Clint] And we will still be friends.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.908
You balked on a promise
made in tenth grade.

24:53.075 --> 24:55.577
Okay, I am down with the baseball term,
that was nice move

24:55.703 --> 24:57.955
-Thank you, well deserved.
-Respect, respect.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.500
It sucks what's happening to you.

25:02.793 --> 25:04.003
It definitely does that.

25:05.254 --> 25:09.383
My aunt says sometimes the universe
gives us a little more than we can handle,

25:09.508 --> 25:11.260
so that we can grow, like, emotionally.

25:12.261 --> 25:16.432
-Sounds kinda smart. I guess.
-No, I don't know. She's weird.

25:18.892 --> 25:20.519
You remember that stuff the other night?

25:21.437 --> 25:22.938
About cotillion? How you...

25:24.398 --> 25:26.567
thought that I'd ask you to a dance?

25:29.528 --> 25:30.696
Okay, truth?

25:31.655 --> 25:34.324
I used to write
"Mrs. Kayla Blackmore" over and over

25:34.408 --> 25:36.118
in all my spelling journals really tiny.

25:36.326 --> 25:38.787
-Seriously?
-Yeah, it was sixth grade.

25:39.204 --> 25:40.789
You went your way and I went mine.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.751
I do remember that you smelled like
that Irish soap.

25:43.876 --> 25:46.920
It was the OCD, okay?
I took like, four showers a day.

25:47.004 --> 25:49.715
And that my feet were, like,
twice as big as yours.

25:49.798 --> 25:51.717
Yeah, and you weren’t very good
with them, Mr. Smooth.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.636
Yeah, they felt like flippers!
What was I supposed to do?

25:56.055 --> 25:58.640
-I want to go back to San Juan.
-God!

26:01.977 --> 26:02.936
Can I tell you something?

26:03.979 --> 26:05.731
-Is it weird?
-Maybe.

26:06.565 --> 26:09.443
[chuckles] No, I just,
I don't know, I remember...

who tried to blow up the school.

41:57.348 --> 41:58.891
They have to know it was a mistake.

42:06.941 --> 42:08.234
[cellphone vibrating]

42:11.154 --> 42:12.947
[Kayla grunts] Ted.

42:14.449 --> 42:20.455
-What's his deal? Seriously, I mean?
-It's platonic. He wants more. But...

42:21.914 --> 42:24.751
He's kinda possessive though,
wouldn't you say?

42:25.710 --> 42:27.795
His dad runs this modeling agency

42:27.879 --> 42:29.338
and they're sending me
to Milan this summer.

42:29.464 --> 42:30.465
Yeah, I heard.

42:31.466 --> 42:34.260
-When do you go?
-Two weeks after graduation.

42:35.720 --> 42:38.973
Anyway, he said, Ted’s having
a hard time fitting in at SC

42:39.057 --> 42:40.975
and asked if I could hang with him some.

42:42.310 --> 42:43.311
Wow...

42:45.438 --> 42:46.314
What?

42:47.982 --> 42:52.278
And you just like hang out with him
'cause his dad's your ticket outta here?

42:55.364 --> 42:56.616
What's your problem, Brett?

42:57.825 --> 42:59.202
No, I mean, I just--

42:59.838 --> 43:01.537
It's just kinda, I don’t know,
morally questionable?

43:01.704 --> 43:02.914
Morally questionable?

43:04.916 --> 43:06.959
I mean, maybe for you

43:07.043 --> 43:10.755
and your endless options
and perfect family. You think I have that?

43:11.255 --> 43:13.633
You think my alcoholic mom
and asshole Steve

43:13.716 --> 43:15.176
are gonna help me pay for college?

43:16.636 --> 43:19.806
Look, I'm earning every cent of it
and who are you to judge me how I do that?

43:22.433 --> 43:24.060
Yeah, you're right. You're right.

43:26.104 --> 43:29.732
Have you even thought that I can't go home
after what we just did?

43:31.275 --> 43:32.276
No.

43:34.028 --> 43:37.240
Shit. I mean, did you think about that
before you smashed the car?

43:37.615 --> 43:40.785
No. No, I didn't
because that's what fuck-it means, right?

43:44.831 --> 43:47.041
Fuck! Do you have a place to stay?

43:47.875 --> 43:50.837
No I don’t. And I, kind of, thought
maybe, I don't know,

43:50.920 --> 43:53.673
someone who cared would maybe
sneak me into their room or something.

43:58.636 --> 43:59.679
It's-- My parents would know.

43:59.929 --> 44:02.390
And what? What?
Think you're becoming a man?

44:03.182 --> 44:04.976
I just, I have to keep it
on the narrow, okay?

44:05.059 --> 44:07.103
I have a meeting tomorrow,
I need to get things back on track.

44:07.270 --> 44:10.148
No, I get it. I get it.
It's all about your needs.

44:11.691 --> 44:14.861
And sure, yeah, judge me
for my morally questionable actions

44:14.944 --> 44:17.321
but you're not even living up
to the shit that you post.

44:20.158 --> 44:22.160

44:22.929 --> 44:25.029
-Kayla! That's not what I meant.
-[Kayla] No, it's fine, Brett.

44:25.154 --> 44:26.280
-Seriously.
-[Brett] Kayla!

[gunshots firing in video game]

44:34.714 --> 44:35.631

and tagging you, you know.

44:39.260 --> 44:41.179
-[Clint] That's crazy.
-I know.

44:41.345 --> 44:42.722
[Nico] It's not crazy. It's a movement.

44:42.930 --> 44:44.891
People are calling you "The Father
of the Fuck-it List."

44:45.016 --> 44:46.517
Maybe I don’t wanna be the father.

44:47.643 --> 44:50.813
-Did anybody consider that?
-All right, you sure?

[Nico] Dude, nice.

45:09.123 --> 45:11.000
You look like you're gonna puke.

45:12.168 --> 45:13.169
Yeah.

45:14.754 --> 45:17.256
-I screwed that up, man.
-Already?

45:18.132 --> 45:20.134
-It's not good.
-Yeah.

45:21.093 --> 45:24.639
[Baird] Let me start by saying
that I understand the tragic components

45:24.805 --> 45:25.723
to this situation.

45:25.890 --> 45:27.934
-It's been a nightmare.
-For all of us.

45:28.226 --> 45:32.146
And it will go down as one of the most
regrettable incidents of my career.

45:32.688 --> 45:36.442
Brett has been an exemplary student
by every measure.

45:36.525 --> 45:39.278
[Kristen] Yes, and obviously we are
incredibly concerned about you

45:39.445 --> 45:41.989
-and the school, and--
-We'd love to put this whole thing

45:42.240 --> 45:44.450
behind us and get back on track.

45:44.617 --> 45:49.789
And with that, we would love
to start the rebuilding fund

45:49.872 --> 45:52.959
for the new and improved
administration building.

45:56.796 --> 45:57.880
It's like we're...

45:58.798 --> 46:00.716
headed down the road
and we picked up a nail,

46:00.925 --> 46:04.512
now we've just got to identify the leak,
fix the leak, fix the flat,

46:04.720 --> 46:07.390
and boom, continue to our destination.

46:07.723 --> 46:10.226
Only I'm afraid
this is more like a stalagmite

46:10.351 --> 46:12.103
that's impaled the entire car.

46:12.937 --> 46:16.023
-Stalagmites, that's the ones that--
-Yes. Up from the floor.

46:16.691 --> 46:20.361
Look, we have two
very serious issues here.

46:20.820 --> 46:25.241
One, a school prank that's gone
horribly awry.

46:25.783 --> 46:27.910
It's unfortunate, it's costly,

46:28.452 --> 46:32.581
it's understandable
in some idiotic teenage way,

46:32.707 --> 46:36.919
because it was an accident
and thankfully, nobody died.

46:37.211 --> 46:41.674
Well, yes, well, the nobody died part.
That, that is a plus.

46:41.924 --> 46:47.638
And the rest can be rebuilt, right?
Probably better than it was before.

46:48.639 --> 46:51.267
-This is gonna be a six-figure number.
-Yes, I understand.

46:52.101 --> 46:56.897
-Okay, so, what is the other issue?
-Speaks to character.

46:57.148 --> 47:00.651
-Integrity. On a-- on a much larger scale.
-Well, that's great then.

47:01.068 --> 47:03.487
Yeah, because as you said,
Brett is exemplary--

47:03.571 --> 47:06.282
Yes, that is the argument I made
to the school board

47:06.532 --> 47:08.284
before the latest development.

47:12.246 --> 47:15.708
Would you like to tell them, Brett?
About your list?

47:22.214 --> 47:26.010
It's-- it's just something that I said
to six of my friends.

47:26.177 --> 47:29.555
-And that list has gone viral.
-That's not my fault.

47:29.847 --> 47:32.767
The perils of social media
have been well documented.

47:32.933 --> 47:37.813
It has almost 100,000 views
and it's been up for less than 36 hours.

47:38.481 --> 47:40.900
-What are we talking about?
-What is it?

47:43.486 --> 47:46.906
I don't know, it's a list, you know,
like a bucket list of things that I...

47:47.865 --> 47:49.075
wish I had done, I guess.

47:49.408 --> 47:51.994
Well, it does rhyme with bucket,
doesn't it?

47:52.203 --> 47:53.412
What rhymes with bucket?

47:54.205 --> 47:57.166
-Oh! Fu--
-Fu-- Brett? Really?

47:57.635 --> 47:59.797
In the middle of this meltdown,
you make a list of all the people

47:59.927 --> 48:01.679
-you want to have sex with?
-Mom--

48:02.963 --> 48:07.051
-No, that's not what it's about.
-Well then, what in God's name is it?

48:07.218 --> 48:10.513
It's about all the times that I wish
I could have just said fuck-it

48:10.638 --> 48:12.181
and done the thing that I wanted to do,

48:12.306 --> 48:15.142
-instead of doing what I was supposed to.
-What you wanted to do? Like what?

48:15.267 --> 48:17.895
Like, play high school basketball.
I wanted to play basketball

48:17.978 --> 48:19.980
but it conflicted with jazz band,
which you made me do.

48:20.106 --> 48:22.942
Yes, because it's a fact
that male reed instrument musicians,

48:23.025 --> 48:24.443
they're in short supply
in the Ivy League--

48:24.527 --> 48:26.946
But I hate reed instruments!
You know that.

48:27.071 --> 48:29.281
You know that, you know that,
you both know that. I hate--

48:29.490 --> 48:32.493
I think that this is an internal issue

48:32.993 --> 48:35.663
that your family needs
to discuss in private.

48:36.163 --> 48:40.584
But as far as Brett's future here
at Cali High...

48:42.002 --> 48:45.214
he won't be receiving his diploma
at this institution.

48:45.923 --> 48:50.094
You've gone from being accepted
to seven out of eight Ivies

48:50.302 --> 48:53.848
to not graduating high school
in the span of 72 hours.

48:54.598 --> 48:56.100
Did you finally get what you wanted?

48:57.143 --> 48:58.394
Maybe it's what I needed.

48:59.145 --> 49:04.275
What-- I'm sorry, what was that,
young man? Get over here right now.

49:05.276 --> 49:10.322

B, you have no business

Sure.

Your mother and I looked up that list

to the one-yard line and then...

59:10.839 --> 59:12.090
this.

59:12.424 --> 59:18.221
-Yeah, but it was your 18-year plan.
-Fair enough.

59:20.766 --> 59:22.350
It was fun while it lasted.

59:25.979 --> 59:29.149
-Listen. When I was your age--
-Dad.

59:29.900 --> 59:32.694
Come on, don't say that you know kids
because you were one once.

59:32.819 --> 59:35.030
All right, nobody's had it
like we do these days.

59:37.324 --> 59:38.283
That's true.

59:41.745 --> 59:42.913
I mean, you said...

59:43.747 --> 59:47.876
right, that success
is becoming one's true, best self,

59:48.001 --> 59:49.795
achieving one's potential.

59:51.004 --> 59:52.172
All right? But, I can't...

59:53.632 --> 59:58.136
I cannot do that with you and mom

You know? I have to be able to...

1:00:11.024 --> 1:00:12.609
make decisions for myself.

1:00:14.945 --> 1:00:17.906
Maybe that's the realization
of wherever you are that you...

1:00:18.990 --> 1:00:20.617
need to make your own decisions.

1:00:22.994 --> 1:00:24.329
But I'd be a lousy parent...

it can't be erased.

1:00:32.963 --> 1:00:35.757
It lives forever,
whether you want it to or not.

Everyone else gets to jump in,
jump out, move on with their lives

1:00:41.638 --> 1:00:44.558
but if you're the face of this thing,
you own it.

1:00:46.434 --> 1:00:50.522
And in the end, who knows how
it'll treat you, because it does not care.

1:00:51.731 --> 1:00:52.649
Not about you.

1:00:55.443 --> 1:00:56.903
No matter how wrong-minded...

your mother and I were
for this 18-year plan...

1:01:04.244 --> 1:01:07.330

1:01:13.044 --> 1:01:14.045
I know you did.

1:01:14.921 --> 1:01:19.301
Part of being an adult is knowing
that sometimes things don't work out.

Sometimes people's lives
get thrown off the rails.

1:01:25.515 --> 1:01:26.850

1:01:38.361 --> 1:01:39.362

It's safe to assume that my car
is in the garage right now, right?

1:01:50.332 --> 1:01:52.209
Oh. Well...

1:01:53.835 --> 1:01:55.420
It's not in the garage yet...

1:01:56.338 --> 1:01:59.507
because I am getting it detailed for you.

1:02:00.967 --> 1:02:02.010
Oh.

1:02:03.053 --> 1:02:05.472
Thank you. That's big of you.

1:02:07.557 --> 1:02:08.558

1:02:19.110 --> 1:02:23.615

1:02:28.714 --> 1:02:29.955
all the metrics seemed to be pointed

1:02:30.080 --> 1:02:32.165
in the right direction,
and most importantly, it's spawning.

1:02:32.374 --> 1:02:36.002
What that means is, kids, they're posting
their lists in honor of yours.

1:02:36.294 --> 1:02:37.963
With this growth rate,
a little viral marketing,

1:02:38.088 --> 1:02:40.966
this thing doubles in a week.
But you gotta keep it relevant, all right.

1:02:41.174 --> 1:02:43.212
You gotta-- you gotta post,
you gotta like kid's posts,

1:02:43.337 --> 1:02:45.053
you gotta keep it a part
of the bigger conversation.

You do that, my friend, you got your shot
at reaching a mil, easy.

1:02:48.348 --> 1:02:50.976

to roll in.

to be seen by anybody.

-Yeah--
-I'm not a poster boy, dude.

-Dude, we-- we get that.
-Butting in, if I may?

It never appears when it should.

1:03:14.291 --> 1:03:16.209
Your frustrations, they're real,
as they should be.

1:03:16.293 --> 1:03:19.254

it's being shared by kids everywhere.

You're tending the flame for all of them.

That's not my list.

-Am I being blamed for this?
-Should you be?

1:04:00.170 --> 1:04:02.797
-What kind of question is that?
-That's a grand jury question.

1:04:03.256 --> 1:04:06.009

1:09:24.494 --> 1:09:25.495
my future.

1:09:28.790 --> 1:09:31.959
-Now, it's all just gone.
-Yeah, it blows.

1:09:34.837 --> 1:09:37.674
-Is that it?
-All I got.

1:09:51.521 --> 1:09:54.232
Okay, Brett. Look, beyond the horizon.

1:09:55.316 --> 1:09:56.526
It's unknown.

1:09:57.443 --> 1:10:00.113
Your future. Just waiting for you
to discover it.

1:10:00.947 --> 1:10:03.366
This shitty time?
Soon it will just be a memory.

1:10:03.616 --> 1:10:06.452
Whether you're still standing here,
stuck, that's all you get to control.

1:10:08.913 --> 1:10:10.998
And what kills the future is fear.

1:10:12.041 --> 1:10:13.167
And your post showed me that.

1:10:14.836 --> 1:10:18.506
So the question is,
what would you do if you had no fear?

1:10:24.846 --> 1:10:25.888
Close your eyes...

1:10:28.891 --> 1:10:30.810
and imagine what you want
your future to be.

1:10:33.271 --> 1:10:34.439
And when you open them...

1:10:36.441 --> 1:10:37.483
that’s your decision.

1:10:41.821 --> 1:10:44.615
And Brett, I meant what I said,
the other day.

1:10:45.533 --> 1:10:46.951
I hope you get what you need.

1:11:06.220 --> 1:11:09.348
<i>Brett, honey, we need you to come home</i>
<i>as fast as you can, okay?</i>

1:11:09.474 --> 1:11:10.475
<i>Hurry up, right now.</i>

1:11:11.434 --> 1:11:12.477
-[sighs]
-Finally!

1:11:13.144 --> 1:11:14.479
-Marheem is coming.
-Marheem is coming.

1:11:16.272 --> 1:11:17.648
Marheem is coming, that's--

1:11:18.524 --> 1:11:20.026
-that's the emergency?
-Brett,

1:11:20.443 --> 1:11:24.697
you have an opportunity to snatch victory
from the jaws of defeat.

1:11:25.448 --> 1:11:30.203
Harvard is impressed with your initiative.
And your "fuck-you" list.

1:11:30.328 --> 1:11:32.789
They want you to write an essay
detailing everything you've learned.

1:11:32.872 --> 1:11:33.915
-What?
-Also,

1:11:34.415 --> 1:11:36.125
Barry seems to think
that the dean's daughters

1:11:36.667 --> 1:11:37.744
are really obsessed with you.

1:11:37.894 --> 1:11:39.619
-Wait. But I don't even--
-[Jeffrey] Not even what?

1:11:39.819 --> 1:11:42.298
What is this "not even"?
Why are you us a "not even" right now?

1:11:42.423 --> 1:11:44.091
-Well, it's just that, I've been...
-What is that?

1:11:45.468 --> 1:11:48.387
...considering everything
and thinking about what I might want

1:11:48.513 --> 1:11:49.430
for myself, you know.

1:11:49.555 --> 1:11:52.433
Hold on, is this "yay" basketball,
"boo" clarinet again, really?

1:11:52.558 --> 1:11:54.310
No, Mom! It's just that-- that--

1:11:55.812 --> 1:11:58.064
It's about my future, you know,
and the unknown.

1:11:58.189 --> 1:12:00.900
Yeah, we're-- we're trying
to get rid of the "un" part

1:12:01.025 --> 1:12:03.277
and get you toward the known part.
That's what we do.

1:12:03.611 --> 1:12:04.695
Dad, I mean we...

1:12:05.988 --> 1:12:08.825
-we talked about this.
-Yes, we did.

1:12:09.492 --> 1:12:11.244
We talked and we hear you, but...

1:12:12.286 --> 1:12:14.163
but, Brett, this is Harvard.

1:12:16.165 --> 1:12:17.166
But...

1:12:18.626 --> 1:12:20.253
I mean, maybe, I'm not even...

1:12:21.838 --> 1:12:23.840
-For real? This is 'cause I...
-[Kristen] Yeah. Brett. Brett!

1:12:24.632 --> 1:12:26.926
-For real.
-Okay, look.

1:12:27.844 --> 1:12:29.095
We have two paths here.

1:12:29.428 --> 1:12:33.975
A, you don't graduate high school
or attend college

1:12:34.183 --> 1:12:36.936
and we deal with the legal
and academic fallout of that

1:12:37.019 --> 1:12:39.647
-for the next five to six years.
-[Kristen] Or maybe forever.

1:12:40.022 --> 1:12:45.736
And then, there's option B, where we--
Where you write a great essay,

1:12:45.987 --> 1:12:50.575
you get into Harvard and you look back
on option A and-- and-- and politely

1:12:50.908 --> 1:12:52.952
smile and give it the finger.

1:12:58.207 --> 1:13:01.335
It doesn't even really sound
like a choice when you put it like that.

1:13:01.419 --> 1:13:04.714
-Exactly!
-Come on! You got this.

1:13:06.215 --> 1:13:07.592
Theme is everything.

1:13:09.719 --> 1:13:10.720
Okay, um...

1:13:13.347 --> 1:13:15.683
Conquering my fear, finding my voice...

1:13:17.059 --> 1:13:19.395
-helping other kids...
-[Marheem] Ugh! Boring.

1:13:19.562 --> 1:13:21.439
Harvard doesn't give a shit
about any of that stuff.

1:13:21.606 --> 1:13:24.186
-But they-- they said--
-Who cares what they said?

1:13:24.361 --> 1:13:26.819
They're a profit-making enterprise.
And they're not giving you this chance

1:13:27.236 --> 1:13:29.447
-because they value what you've done.
-They're not?

1:13:30.406 --> 1:13:32.700
Brett, please. Don't be an idiot.
Your parents are on the clock.

1:13:33.200 --> 1:13:35.536
Okay, then what is their motive?

1:13:35.828 --> 1:13:37.914
-To stop your little movement.
-Really?

1:13:38.039 --> 1:13:39.999
[Marheem] I'm sure on some level
Harvard is impressed,

1:13:40.166 --> 1:13:41.751
but you've become a voice of dissent,

1:13:42.043 --> 1:13:44.170
galvanizing the masses
against their oppressors.

1:13:44.545 --> 1:13:46.964
The educational industrial complex
has been hijacked

1:13:47.048 --> 1:13:48.341
and turned into a money press.

1:13:48.674 --> 1:13:53.429
Private schools, tutor fees,
personal counselors, test prep materials,

1:13:53.512 --> 1:13:55.932
online courses, test fees,
application fees,

1:13:56.015 --> 1:13:59.226
all designed to bind kids
ages four to 18 to the machinery.

1:13:59.393 --> 1:14:02.313
It sucks parents dry,
and drives you into institutions

1:14:02.396 --> 1:14:06.442
that cost a quarter of a million dollars
for an undergraduate degree.

1:14:07.276 --> 1:14:10.738
-A piece of paper.
-That could be our theme.

1:14:11.322 --> 1:14:12.406
Are you hallucinating?

1:14:14.492 --> 1:14:17.828
The system is imperfect, Brett.
But it's the system.

1:14:18.287 --> 1:14:20.957
-Don't try and change it, exploit it!
-Okay. I'm not-- I don't--

1:14:21.582 --> 1:14:25.169
I don't know what you're saying,
Marheem, and I haven't had any sleep

1:14:25.252 --> 1:14:27.296
and the past few weeks
have just been a real shit show,

1:14:27.380 --> 1:14:32.051
so if you could just explain to me,
just tell me what to write, please.

1:14:32.301 --> 1:14:35.137
I am, Brett. But first,
you need to wake up.

1:14:35.805 --> 1:14:37.974
You had it right for the past 15 years.

1:14:38.265 --> 1:14:40.935
Play their game,
get a degree from Harvard,

1:14:41.060 --> 1:14:44.230
and then you can do anything
you want with your life.

1:14:45.106 --> 1:14:46.691
Do you want to be able to do anything--

1:14:46.816 --> 1:14:49.318
I want to be able to do
anything I want in my life.

1:14:49.694 --> 1:14:52.446
Good. Then, contrition.

1:14:56.617 --> 1:14:59.286
-Excuse me?
-Your theme is contrition.

1:14:59.787 --> 1:15:02.665
You realize that the past few weeks
have been an epic life-fart,

1:15:02.790 --> 1:15:04.875
a moment of behavioral flatulence

1:15:05.042 --> 1:15:08.379
caused by a freak accident
that occurred during an incident

1:15:08.462 --> 1:15:11.757
that you were roped into by your
prankster friends, and you are sorry.

1:15:12.091 --> 1:15:13.259
You are repentant.

1:15:13.551 --> 1:15:17.513
You wanna get your life back on track,
and Harvard is the place to do that.

1:15:22.059 --> 1:15:23.602
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

1:15:25.229 --> 1:15:26.439
Yeah, life-fart. I can...

1:15:28.190 --> 1:15:29.233
I can write that.

1:15:33.070 --> 1:15:34.071
[sighs]

1:15:46.625 --> 1:15:48.627
[sighs]

1:16:10.357 --> 1:16:11.275
What's he doing?

1:16:12.234 --> 1:16:14.987
He's thinking. He's got to be thinking.

1:16:15.112 --> 1:16:17.823
Yes. Shouldn't that occur
in front of a computer?

1:16:22.661 --> 1:16:23.662
Brett?

1:16:25.247 --> 1:16:27.333
-[Brett] Hmm?
-How's the essay coming?

1:16:28.334 --> 1:16:29.376
Good.

1:16:30.252 --> 1:16:31.712
When do think we'll get a draft?

1:16:32.630 --> 1:16:33.547
Soon.

1:16:35.091 --> 1:16:36.509
Would you mind taking off your glasses?

1:16:37.676 --> 1:16:38.677
Wanna see your eyes.

1:16:43.140 --> 1:16:44.141
Are you okay?

1:16:45.309 --> 1:16:47.103
Yeah, I'm good, Dad. I'm good.

1:16:47.228 --> 1:16:49.355
There's nothing going on
that we should know about?

1:16:49.855 --> 1:16:50.856
[Brett] No.

1:16:52.483 --> 1:16:54.276
You're gonna get the essay
done on time, right?

1:16:54.902 --> 1:16:56.070
What? You want me to promise?

1:16:56.612 --> 1:16:58.072
-Wouldn't hurt.
-Yeah!

1:17:07.373 --> 1:17:09.250
[Jeffrey] Brett! Brett!

1:17:12.002 --> 1:17:15.172
-Is-- is he promising?
-[Kristen] Uh. I think that's a...

1:17:19.927 --> 1:17:21.720
-[woman] Okay, smile!
-]Stacy] Wait, wait, wait!

1:17:21.887 --> 1:17:23.314
-One more, one more!
-[woman] Smile, guys.

1:17:24.515 --> 1:17:28.477
-[woman] Okay. One more. Aw, sweet.
-Dude, I'm so proud of you.

1:17:29.145 --> 1:17:32.356
-It's too cool, huh?
-Okay, okay, Mom! I think that's enough.

1:17:33.983 --> 1:17:34.900
[Stacy] Okay! Bye!

1:17:35.025 --> 1:17:37.077
-[Clint] All right, see you, Stace!
-[Nico] See you, Stace!

1:17:41.824 --> 1:17:43.033
[Clint] Yeah, it's crazy.

1:17:43.909 --> 1:17:46.579
-[Brett] Nice robes, graduates.
-[Nico] There he is!

1:17:47.496 --> 1:17:49.540
Did you catch that? Ritualistic freedom!

1:17:49.665 --> 1:17:52.918
No, I actually just showed up.
I’m not even sure I'm allowed on campus.

1:17:53.002 --> 1:17:55.129
You are gonna write the shit
out of that essay.

1:17:55.504 --> 1:17:56.505
Yeah.

1:17:59.884 --> 1:18:02.970
-Hey, we'll catch up with you in a bit.
-Sounds good. Have fun.

1:18:07.641 --> 1:18:09.977
[Brett inhales, exhales]

1:18:13.772 --> 1:18:14.773
[woman laughs]

1:18:22.239 --> 1:18:24.867
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

1:18:26.994 --> 1:18:28.579
I hear you're abandoning the list.

1:18:28.829 --> 1:18:31.749
Yeah, Harvard is pretty--
it's pretty tough to pass up.

1:18:32.124 --> 1:18:33.125
I get it.

1:18:34.001 --> 1:18:35.794
If that’s your decision,
I’m happy for you.

1:18:37.713 --> 1:18:38.714
Yeah, me too.

1:18:40.299 --> 1:18:41.634
[car horn honking]

1:18:42.635 --> 1:18:45.012
Look, can we just hang out before you go
to Europe, please?

1:18:45.304 --> 1:18:48.307
I'm actually-- I'm leaving tonight.

1:18:48.459 --> 1:18:49.975
I thought you said
you have, like, two weeks?

1:18:50.142 --> 1:18:52.019
Things change. It happens.

1:18:52.603 --> 1:18:54.980
-[car horn honks]
-I gotta go.

1:19:02.404 --> 1:19:04.782
Good luck. Seriously.

1:19:15.084 --> 1:19:19.380
Just like that. Life moment,
like your dad always says.

1:19:20.256 --> 1:19:23.175
-She's leaving tonight.
-Yeah, well, dude, it's couch surfing.

1:19:23.259 --> 1:19:24.260
It blows.

1:19:25.219 --> 1:19:28.097
And Steve filed charges
for the car thing, so, you know.

1:19:28.180 --> 1:19:29.723
Why didn't she tell me any of this?

1:19:31.141 --> 1:19:33.310
Brett, come on. You were valedictorian.

1:19:33.394 --> 1:19:35.396
What good is that
if you can't figure this shit out?

1:19:50.119 --> 1:19:52.454
[car door closes, engine starts]

1:20:02.339 --> 1:20:04.300
[Clint] You can't take it down.
You know that.

1:20:05.217 --> 1:20:07.052
Yeah, I'm familiar
with how the Internet works.

1:20:09.305 --> 1:20:10.931
I'm just gonna post
my Harvard letter, man.

1:20:11.515 --> 1:20:13.434
Serves an act of contrition and...

1:20:14.393 --> 1:20:15.894
you know, disconnect me
from the movement.

1:20:16.520 --> 1:20:17.896
But that won't end it.

1:20:19.523 --> 1:20:23.152
-Well, it'll end my involvement with it.
-It's done some good, you know.

1:20:24.528 --> 1:20:25.529
[chuckles]

1:20:27.489 --> 1:20:30.200
Clint, you realize that my whole life
didn't have to crater for you to come out.

1:20:30.284 --> 1:20:32.244
Bro, get outside of yourself.

1:20:32.411 --> 1:20:36.665
You think I'm the only one
that found the balls to face my fears?

1:20:37.166 --> 1:20:41.253
No, you gave courage to a whole
lot of people. That is worth something.

1:20:41.628 --> 1:20:44.173
Brett, how's the-- Hey, Clint.

1:20:44.923 --> 1:20:48.552
Oh. Hello, Mrs. Blackmore.
I was just leaving.

1:20:54.892 --> 1:20:55.893
Can I read a draft?

1:20:57.311 --> 1:20:59.480
-Uh. No, not yet.
-Why not?

1:21:02.566 --> 1:21:03.567
I'm working on it.

1:21:04.777 --> 1:21:07.279
-You know, you have to turn this in soon.
-I know. I know.

1:21:08.113 --> 1:21:09.448
-I know.
-When?

1:21:10.366 --> 1:21:11.408
Soon.

1:21:12.701 --> 1:21:13.619
Tomorrow.

1:21:15.606 --> 1:21:16.955
You're not going to blow this, are you?

1:21:17.081 --> 1:21:18.624
-Mom!
-Okay, sorry.

1:21:25.339 --> 1:21:26.673
[exhales]

1:21:47.027 --> 1:21:47.945
Hey, bro.

1:21:50.155 --> 1:21:51.156
Oh, man!

1:21:53.700 --> 1:21:56.662
You've had a rough few weeks, man.
I mean, shit.

1:21:58.539 --> 1:22:01.375
-That's fairly accurate.
-You know there are times when I just...

1:22:03.293 --> 1:22:05.838
-think if I hadn't stepped on that pipe--
-Dude, don't even go there.

1:22:07.714 --> 1:22:08.632
Don't go there.

1:22:13.137 --> 1:22:14.388
[chuckles]

1:22:16.890 --> 1:22:20.978
Man! We're like a metaphor for life,
you and me, you know that?

1:22:23.272 --> 1:22:24.606
Born in the same town...

1:22:25.482 --> 1:22:28.569
grew up going to the same schools,
and playing in the same little leagues.

1:22:32.072 --> 1:22:36.243
And now, you're poised to depart,
again for like...

1:22:37.077 --> 1:22:40.581
a life of big shit, like, Ivy League,
and mega financial success.

1:22:41.248 --> 1:22:42.124
Maybe.

1:22:44.668 --> 1:22:45.669
I don't know.

1:22:50.632 --> 1:22:53.135
What about you?
Other half of the metaphor.

1:22:53.719 --> 1:22:54.720
You know me.

1:22:55.512 --> 1:22:58.140
Start working for my dad,
join the plumbers union.

1:22:58.724 --> 1:22:59.850
pull 100-G a year.

1:23:01.059 --> 1:23:03.854
Surf and party. Just live.

1:23:04.438 --> 1:23:08.525
-That doesn't sound bad, dude.
-Yeah, it's really not. I'm stoked.

1:23:18.327 --> 1:23:21.663
Yo, is that who I think? Dee?

1:23:22.623 --> 1:23:23.790
[Les] Yeah, that's Dee.

1:23:24.416 --> 1:23:27.628
Talk about a fall from grace.
There's your cautionary tale.

1:23:29.296 --> 1:23:31.673
-What do you mean?
-Dude, the wall.

1:23:32.424 --> 1:23:35.552
I mean, you guys were almost neighbors
until your world exploded.

1:23:36.220 --> 1:23:37.179
[Brett] What?

1:23:37.930 --> 1:23:39.765
[Les] Dee. Douglas Ebeyer.

1:23:40.933 --> 1:23:45.521
<i>He was valedictorian, like, 20 years ago.</i>
<i>Dude, he was you.</i>

1:24:14.258 --> 1:24:16.051
[Brett]
<i>Dear Harvard Admissions Committee...</i>

1:24:17.427 --> 1:24:20.639
<i>everyone tells me that acceptance</i>
<i>to your institution is the first step</i>

1:24:20.722 --> 1:24:22.432
<i>on the path to guaranteed success.</i>

1:24:23.392 --> 1:24:26.311
<i>And yet, I have no idea what that means.</i>

1:24:27.354 --> 1:24:32.067
<i>Are we talking money? A big job?</i>
<i>A mansion in a community of mansions?</i>

1:24:33.110 --> 1:24:36.446
<i>My dad says, "Success is about becoming</i>
<i>your true self."</i>

1:24:37.447 --> 1:24:39.449
<i>But how many parents really want</i>
<i>their kids to do that?</i>

1:24:40.576 --> 1:24:44.871
<i>Parents and institutions ignore evidence</i>
<i>about how to raise happy children</i>

1:24:45.205 --> 1:24:49.376
<i>and then expect us to just be happy,</i>
<i>or force us to be just as unhappy as them.</i>

1:24:51.128 --> 1:24:53.255
<i>Studies show that adolescents</i>
<i>are nocturnal.</i>

1:24:53.880 --> 1:24:56.800
<i>Our biorhythms cause us</i>
<i>to stay up later and wake up later.</i>

1:24:57.801 --> 1:25:00.012
<i>And yet school still starts at 7:45 am.</i>

1:25:01.054 --> 1:25:03.974
<i>Studies also show that GPA</i>
<i>and standardized test scores</i>

1:25:04.141 --> 1:25:08.645
<i>do not accurately measure future academic,</i>
<i>professional or personal success...</i>

1:25:09.688 --> 1:25:11.898
<i>and yet those are still</i>
<i>the barometers of acceptance.</i>

1:25:12.357 --> 1:25:15.444
<i>I could go on and on,</i>
<i>but you get the point.</i>

1:25:17.154 --> 1:25:20.198
<i>So, why doesn't the system adapt?</i>
<i>I'll tell you why.</i>

1:25:20.282 --> 1:25:24.453
<i>Because the system is more dedicated</i>
<i>to itself than to future generations.</i>

1:25:25.203 --> 1:25:27.706
<i>Your university was kind enough</i>
<i>to extend me this opportunity</i>

1:25:27.873 --> 1:25:32.294
<i>to pull myself back from the abyss.</i>
<i>And I am grateful for that, for sure.</i>

1:25:34.504 --> 1:25:35.672
<i>But I'm not contrite.</i>

1:25:36.632 --> 1:25:38.717
<i>I am the opposite of contrite.</i>

1:25:39.468 --> 1:25:42.262
<i>The system rewards drones,</i>
<i>rule-followers, test-takers.</i>

1:25:42.429 --> 1:25:45.349
<i>We graduate, make money, have kids,</i>
<i>and continue the cycle.</i>

1:25:45.474 --> 1:25:47.517
<i>And I've felt for years that my dreams</i>
<i>have been sanded down</i>

1:25:47.601 --> 1:25:50.020
<i>so that I can fit into the mechanism</i>
<i>of this machine.</i>

1:25:51.438 --> 1:25:53.357
<i>My friend tells me,</i>
<i>"What kills your future is fear.”</i>

1:25:54.066 --> 1:25:55.692
<i>It kills the pursuit of the unknown.</i>

1:25:56.443 --> 1:25:58.612
<i>Now, it took a while, but I've learned</i>
<i>how right that friend is.</i>

1:25:59.696 --> 1:26:02.574
<i>So now I'm out here running in fresh snow,</i>
<i>where there are no tracks.</i>

1:26:03.241 --> 1:26:04.701
<i>I have no idea where I'm going...</i>

1:26:06.328 --> 1:26:08.705
<i>but I know that it'll be someplace</i>
<i>I couldn't possibly discover</i>

1:26:08.830 --> 1:26:10.832
<i>while transiting the passageways</i>
<i>of your institution.</i>

1:26:12.334 --> 1:26:13.377
<i>So, with that...</i>

1:26:14.252 --> 1:26:16.129
<i>I say thank you for your offer but...</i>

1:26:17.547 --> 1:26:19.675
<i>in the most respectful way, I respond...</i>

1:26:20.967 --> 1:26:23.595
<i>Fuck it. Harvard's not for me.</i>

1:26:24.971 --> 1:26:27.349
<i>Respectfully, Brett Blackmore.</i>

1:26:34.147 --> 1:26:35.357
Fuck it.

1:27:04.010 --> 1:27:05.679
[sighs]

1:27:19.109 --> 1:27:22.612
We were trying really hard,
me and your father.

1:27:26.742 --> 1:27:28.744
Everyone else was having babies. Us?

1:27:29.870 --> 1:27:31.037
Miscarriages.

1:27:33.081 --> 1:27:36.460
So, when we finally had you, it was...

1:27:39.171 --> 1:27:40.088
everything.

1:27:42.799 --> 1:27:46.970
I gave up architecture and I signed on
to the Westside young mother role

1:27:47.053 --> 1:27:49.055
and I loved it.

1:27:52.976 --> 1:27:54.936
But, somewhere along the way, I, um...

1:27:56.229 --> 1:27:58.064
I kind of lost track of who I was.

1:28:00.442 --> 1:28:03.320
I started living through you
because all those years I...

1:28:04.154 --> 1:28:07.324
I had been living for you,
and when you take on that role,

1:28:07.699 --> 1:28:10.368
nothing is more important
than how your kid is perceived

1:28:10.452 --> 1:28:13.997
because that's how you're perceived.
That's the measure of success and it...

1:28:14.790 --> 1:28:15.791
it blows.

1:28:17.667 --> 1:28:19.169
My dad would say...

1:28:20.545 --> 1:28:22.130
"The hard choice is the right choice."

1:28:22.672 --> 1:28:24.883
I used to tell you that, right?
All the time when you were little.

1:28:25.425 --> 1:28:27.135
I just didn't think that applied to me.

1:28:28.053 --> 1:28:31.097
And reading the essay you posted, I...

1:28:32.682 --> 1:28:33.892
I remember it does.

1:28:50.075 --> 1:28:52.911
You know, I never knew
why Mom gave up architecture.

1:28:53.578 --> 1:28:54.913
She was super talented.

1:29:00.293 --> 1:29:01.294
You were.

1:29:09.052 --> 1:29:12.556
[indistinct chatter]

1:29:18.770 --> 1:29:21.231
[Zim] That's good.
If you put it right there.

1:29:22.941 --> 1:29:23.942
Who is that?

1:29:24.276 --> 1:29:26.027
Jessica, make sure the streets are clear

1:29:26.111 --> 1:29:28.822
and if there are any vendors here
that do not belong, let me know.

1:29:28.947 --> 1:29:29.948
Um...

1:29:30.782 --> 1:29:31.950
it's my PR guy.

1:29:33.201 --> 1:29:35.954
-You have a PR guy?
-Yeah.

1:29:37.414 --> 1:29:38.373
Thank you so much.

1:29:39.958 --> 1:29:41.084
They're selling them.

1:29:41.751 --> 1:29:44.337
-There's a shaved ice truck out.
-[Kristen] That's not beer, is it?

1:29:44.713 --> 1:29:45.881
[Jeffrey] It's kombucha.

1:29:47.883 --> 1:29:49.217
It's money day, let's get it.

1:29:49.926 --> 1:29:51.469
Holy crap! Guys!

1:29:53.722 --> 1:29:55.056
I hit three million followers.

1:29:56.600 --> 1:29:58.560
And my essay's been shared
ten million times.

1:30:00.395 --> 1:30:01.438
-[Kristen] What?
-Yeah.

1:30:01.521 --> 1:30:02.439
[doorbell rings]

1:30:03.773 --> 1:30:06.359
Uh. I gotta go put pants on, hold on.

1:30:11.239 --> 1:30:14.826
[sighs] I just got off a conference call
with the Harvard board.

1:30:14.951 --> 1:30:18.038
Look, Mr. Brooks, I'm sorry, all right.
I know what they wanted to hear, but I...

1:30:19.372 --> 1:30:21.249
-I had to tell the truth.
-And we couldn't be more proud

1:30:21.333 --> 1:30:23.162
so if you're here to tell us
that he's blown it,

1:30:23.262 --> 1:30:24.628
-and that it doesn't--
-Hold on, please!

1:30:25.378 --> 1:30:26.755
They couldn't agree with you more.

1:30:28.173 --> 1:30:30.133
They know all too well the problems
with the system.

1:30:32.552 --> 1:30:33.762
Wait. Are you, what--

1:30:35.221 --> 1:30:37.223
What are you, I don't--
What are you saying?

1:30:37.515 --> 1:30:40.852
You are just the type
of out-of-the-box thinker Harvard wants.

1:30:42.020 --> 1:30:43.813
-[cellphone ringing]
-As a matter of fact,

1:30:44.272 --> 1:30:45.941
this must Dean Reilly right now.

1:30:46.524 --> 1:30:49.653
-She wants to talk to you personally.
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1:30:50.195 --> 1:30:51.738
[Barry] You just got your boy
into Harvard!

1:30:52.530 --> 1:30:53.531
Hello?

1:30:55.283 --> 1:30:56.368
Yeah, this is...

1:31:02.707 --> 1:31:04.167
[Jeffrey] Hello, hey?

1:31:05.293 --> 1:31:06.211
[Brett] Yeah.

1:31:07.963 --> 1:31:09.339
Nice to meet you too.

1:31:18.848 --> 1:31:23.269
[women speaking foreign language]

1:31:23.520 --> 1:31:25.772
<i>Es </i>Brett Blackmore. Bad ass.

1:31:30.110 --> 1:31:32.654
<i>I learned, it's that, this generation</i>

1:31:32.737 --> 1:31:34.322
<i>'cause everybody has their own.</i>

1:31:50.213 --> 1:31:52.632
Bret, you've become the voice
of a generation.

1:31:52.876 --> 1:31:54.676
[Brett] I don't know about that,
if there's one thing

1:31:54.759 --> 1:31:55.844
that I've learned it's that

1:31:56.052 --> 1:31:58.096
this generation doesn't need a voice,
right, because...

1:31:59.264 --> 1:32:02.892
-we all have our own.
-Deep thinking for an 18-year-old.

1:32:03.977 --> 1:32:07.647
No, not really. I mean,
it's just the reality of our generation.

1:32:08.857 --> 1:32:10.734
Right? And I'm not just talking
about myself. I mean...

1:32:11.484 --> 1:32:13.903
all these people that are here with us.
These guys, especially.

1:32:14.029 --> 1:32:16.239
These, these are the people
you should be talking to.

1:32:16.614 --> 1:32:19.951
-Seriously, go talk to them.
-You're all creators of the infamous list.

1:32:20.660 --> 1:32:22.829
My guy, you realize
what you've accomplished, right?

1:32:22.912 --> 1:32:25.790
You have done something only a handful
of people have been able to do

1:32:25.915 --> 1:32:28.168
-in over six million years.
-What's that?

1:32:29.210 --> 1:32:32.422
You've gone viral, bro.
Like, you've gone massively viral.

1:32:32.714 --> 1:32:34.340
-I'm proud of you.
-Thanks, man.

1:32:35.842 --> 1:32:38.845
Look, you wanna rep me?
Like, seriously, rep me.

1:32:39.012 --> 1:32:40.680
I'm not standing in this hot sun
for nothing.

-I need something.

-Right now.

-You can!
-Of course, I can! I'm your guy.

-Let's roll.
-Give me those keys. Come on.

1:32:58.490 --> 1:33:01.576

Okay? Take this off.

Let's go, girls, important clients.

Hey. [speaking foreign language]

1:33:23.890 --> 1:33:26.893

Just stay with us.

1:33:42.325 --> 1:33:43.493
[woman] You want in this business?

1:33:44.869 --> 1:33:45.995
These are the dues.

1:33:46.746 --> 1:33:50.208

1:33:51.084 --> 1:33:53.253
opportunities and stepping stones.

1:33:54.420 --> 1:33:55.421
Your choice.

1:33:59.342 --> 1:34:02.428
No, I've seen this shit before.
This is not what I signed up for.

1:34:02.554 --> 1:34:06.141
But you did sign, so,
you'll need a lawyer to get out.

1:34:10.270 --> 1:34:11.896
You ever just want to say "fuck-it"?

1:34:12.605 --> 1:34:18.945
[chuckles] Me? Every day.
Sometimes every hour.

1:34:20.613 --> 1:34:23.575
Still, your best move?

1:34:25.577 --> 1:34:26.578
Get on the boat.

Thank you, thank you.

-Is that it?
-Mm-hmm.

1:35:15.210 --> 1:35:16.878
[blows] When do they come back?

1:35:17.420 --> 1:35:21.049
Morning. Next week.
Some not until October.

1:35:21.758 --> 1:35:23.676
Shit! Shit! Shit.

1:35:24.802 --> 1:35:25.803
Thank you.

1:35:44.197 --> 1:35:45.573
This one is for you?

1:35:46.783 --> 1:35:49.619
Yeah... pretty much.

1:35:51.287 --> 1:35:52.247
There's one every year.

1:36:06.052 --> 1:36:09.722
-What are you doing there?
-Me? I think the question is you?

1:36:11.182 --> 1:36:12.392
I'm chasing my...

1:36:14.769 --> 1:36:16.479
I'm chasing you, really.

1:36:17.647 --> 1:36:20.358
Yeah? How’s that working for you?

1:36:21.025 --> 1:36:22.986
I don't know, you tell me.

1:36:24.279 --> 1:36:25.363
A little stalker-y, maybe?

1:36:26.531 --> 1:36:29.033
Nope. It’s exactly the right amount.

1:36:30.201 --> 1:36:31.953
Good, 'cause something
just brushed up against me

1:36:32.036 --> 1:36:33.621
and I need to get the hell outta here.

1:36:38.960 --> 1:36:41.170
Wait, you didn't really blow off Harvard?

1:36:42.630 --> 1:36:46.009
-I did, yeah.
-That was, like, your dream.

1:36:47.051 --> 1:36:49.554
They asked me if I wanted
to defer for a year.

1:36:49.762 --> 1:36:52.807
-That's awesome.
-I said no.

1:36:54.392 --> 1:36:56.394
-They offered me a scholarship.
-What?

1:36:56.686 --> 1:36:58.062
I said no, again.

1:37:00.415 --> 1:37:01.916
I had to Heimlich my parents on that one.

1:37:01.983 --> 1:37:04.110
-<i>Both of them choking at once, seriously.</i>

-[Jeffrey gasps]
-[Kristen gasps]

1:37:05.620 --> 1:37:07.905
Then they offered me
a visiting professorship.

1:37:09.324 --> 1:37:11.909
-Like, a guest lecturing kind of thing.
-Oh.

1:37:12.493 --> 1:37:15.955
-I thought that sounded kinda cool.
-Yeah, that's really cool. That's awesome.

1:37:16.414 --> 1:37:17.332
Maybe.

1:37:22.086 --> 1:37:23.629
Sneaking someone into your room?

1:37:25.214 --> 1:37:26.549
Seemed like an overdue idea.

1:37:27.759 --> 1:37:28.718
Really?

1:37:33.890 --> 1:37:36.934
<i>♪ So you wanna stick around? ♪</i>

1:37:39.062 --> 1:37:43.900
<i>♪ So you wanna wait and hold me darling? ♪</i>

1:37:44.442 --> 1:37:45.360
One mistake.

1:37:46.402 --> 1:37:49.447
That's it, really.
And it destroyed everything.

1:37:50.531 --> 1:37:54.035
But through that, I discovered that fear
really is the killer. Sometimes...

1:37:54.911 --> 1:37:57.914
