01:48.025 --> 01:50.777
- Right there.
- Okay.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.620
(clanging)

02:00.788 --> 02:02.872
Be careful as you walk.

02:06.168 --> 02:08.461
Just leave them here.

02:31.735 --> 02:33.611
(knocks)

02:35.989 --> 02:39.325
23... four, five, six.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.871
51 , 52.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.881
(door closes)

02:57.761 --> 03:00.930
"The latest news."

03:01.098 --> 03:02.974
Martha:
I fail to understand,

03:03.141 --> 03:05.685
if I who am most affected
am not disturbed, why you should be.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.729
Perhaps I'm disturbed by a reason
different from what you believe.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.232
Forgive me then for believing
the one you've given.

03:11.400 --> 03:14.819
I disapprove of changing from day to day
when the school is to be relocated.

03:14.987 --> 03:17.363
- Speak to the theater people then.
- What disturbs me

03:17.531 --> 03:19.532
is your accepting
the uncertainty without quarrel.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.785
For whatever reason, the theater people
keep deferring their moving in.

03:22.953 --> 03:26.038
I don't want the children to feel
they're leaving vacant what has been

03:26.206 --> 03:29.584
their place of education. I want them
to leave it as a place with new life.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.961
- Fine, Martha.
- What good would quarreling with them do?

03:32.129 --> 03:34.463
- Fine.
- It seems you waked intent we quarrel.

03:34.631 --> 03:37.967
- (sighs)
- Nor, may I say, claiming you were pleased

03:38.135 --> 03:40.678
with the outcome of your meeting
with the other men of the camp,

03:40.846 --> 03:44.265
did you retire last night
with your customary sweetness.

03:44.433 --> 03:48.227
Do please then forgive me...
for Christ's sake!

03:50.981 --> 03:53.024
(sighs)

03:54.026 --> 03:56.611
Do please forgive me.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.991
(door closes)

04:07.998 --> 04:09.999
Mornin'.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.962
Seth: How did Hearst
take the letter?

04:15.130 --> 04:17.089
I don't know.
Is the paper even out yet?

04:17.257 --> 04:19.634
Guess you don't fuckin' know much.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.594
Do you, Sol?

04:21.762 --> 04:24.722
I guess I don't.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.099
Do you want to fight?

04:27.267 --> 04:30.394
- (gunshots)
- Man: Whoo!

04:30.562 --> 04:32.897
(gunshots)

04:40.530 --> 04:43.699
- (gunshot)
- Whoo! Whoo.

04:43.867 --> 04:46.369
Teamster:
Hold on! Whoa!

04:46.536 --> 04:48.788
Whoa! Road agents...

04:48.956 --> 04:52.124
- ambushed us a couple of miles out!
- Anyone hurt?

04:52.292 --> 04:54.543
Cocksuckers dropped a tree
across the road.

04:54.711 --> 04:58.547
We just come up on it and they started
shootin' from the fuckin' ridgeline.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.050
Would have lost
the strongbox sure, Sheriff,

05:01.218 --> 05:04.053
if not for them there that laid down
rifle fire as covered us.

05:04.221 --> 05:07.390
Whoo! Fuck me! Holy fuck.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.308
Holy fuck, right, Wyatt?

05:09.476 --> 05:13.813
- I'd like to buy you both a fucking drink.
- That's a big fucking yes from both of us.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.065
You hit anyone?

05:16.233 --> 05:18.484
No, we were just trying
to drive 'em off, Sheriff.

05:18.652 --> 05:21.529
- How many were there?
- Two or three.

05:21.697 --> 05:23.531
I heard one of 'em
shout like you winged 'em.

05:23.699 --> 05:25.658
They was dodging behind stumps
and making for cover.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.911
Hey. Why don't you go in there
and get drunk with them,

05:29.079 --> 05:31.622
let the Sheriff and I finish our talk?

05:31.790 --> 05:34.083
All right.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.756
Little brother's got me for a hero.

05:40.924 --> 05:42.466
What's your name?

05:42.634 --> 05:46.262
I'm Wyatt, and going in there
to get drunk is Morgan Earp.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.515
I was a lawman in Dodge City,

05:49.683 --> 05:51.767
before that in Wichita.

05:51.935 --> 05:54.437
But I ain't looking
for none of that here.

05:54.604 --> 05:57.189
- What are you looking for?
- We got a timber lease.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.358
You and your brother?

06:01.194 --> 06:02.528
What's your name?

06:02.696 --> 06:04.655
Seth Bullock.

06:04.823 --> 06:07.116
How do you do?

06:07.284 --> 06:09.785
There is a fella that wants
to buy you a drink.

06:10.829 --> 06:12.121
Over at The Gem.

06:12.289 --> 06:14.040
All right.

06:16.626 --> 06:20.504
Shall I authorize a watering and feeding
of these gentlemen's horses, Sheriff?

06:23.633 --> 06:25.843
As mayor?
As a gesture from the camp?

06:29.598 --> 06:31.432
One at a time...

06:31.600 --> 06:35.478
lest they drag you
to a deserved demise.

06:43.945 --> 06:45.696
Ugh, fuck.

06:45.864 --> 06:48.574
It's me, Jane.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.743
If you want the bed, I'm leaving.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.287
Don't go nowhere on my account.

06:53.455 --> 06:55.664
I'm a fuckin' floor sleeper anyway.

06:57.626 --> 07:00.503
I want to find fruit for
the schoolchildren's morning snack.

07:00.670 --> 07:03.005
Uh, I'm up, I'm up, I'm up.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.883
I'll get the hell out of here.
(sniffles)

07:07.677 --> 07:09.178
Why not stay?

07:09.346 --> 07:12.306
I got errands all morning myself.
(sniffles)

07:12.474 --> 07:14.683
If you just heard me fart, excuse me.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.446
Will you come back later?

07:28.698 --> 07:30.866
Uh...

07:31.034 --> 07:33.244
maybe maybe.

07:35.914 --> 07:38.541
It's heads or tails where
any fuckin' day will take me.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.709
(Jane panting)

07:49.845 --> 07:52.346
I'll not have vile affections

07:52.514 --> 07:54.765
or uncleanness on these premises!

07:54.933 --> 07:57.017
Find my specific meaning at

07:57.185 --> 08:01.438
Romans I:24-26--

08:01.606 --> 08:02.898
Fuck yourself

08:03.066 --> 08:05.568
with a fist punch up your ass

08:05.735 --> 08:08.112
today at the present moment.

08:11.741 --> 08:14.076
I gotta go.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.579
I'm moving out of that fucking place.

08:16.746 --> 08:20.207
Not me. Not me.
I never fuckin' moved in.

08:22.419 --> 08:24.587
--and verses following.

08:36.933 --> 08:40.019
Don't think you was offered
a job here last night.

08:40.187 --> 08:44.148
Gauging the fucking level you'd
fucking presume to was all that was.

08:51.281 --> 08:55.743
Maybe you declined 'cause you thought you
ought to be partners in the fuckin' business,

08:55.911 --> 08:58.454
name on the signage like a human's

08:58.622 --> 09:01.832
or God hadn't set man apart
from the fucking beasts!

09:04.711 --> 09:08.631
I got an errand, then I'm going
to San Francisco.

09:08.798 --> 09:11.800
We will never be equal,
sign or fucking no.

09:11.968 --> 09:15.721
And if I agreed to your name
on the signage,

09:15.889 --> 09:20.059
we would know the fucking truth still.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.314
Fucking nigger bastard!

09:25.482 --> 09:28.317
Assuming to leave
without my consent.

09:28.485 --> 09:31.487
(sighs)

09:35.075 --> 09:38.244
Not without a fucking saddle, he won't.

09:40.121 --> 09:43.290
Not if I hide his fucking saddle

09:43.458 --> 09:45.626
till he reveals fucking Hostetler's

09:45.794 --> 09:48.212
nigger voodoo ciphering methods.

09:48.380 --> 09:51.548
So accounts ain't constantly

09:51.716 --> 09:54.176
to be carried around in the man's mind

09:54.344 --> 09:57.304
till he lives in terror of taking a drink!

10:09.776 --> 10:13.612
Implying what by that
fucking lordly look?

10:13.780 --> 10:17.866
That he'll outflank my tactics
buying a new fucking saddle?

10:24.082 --> 10:28.252
Then I don't suppose you'll mind
the improved fucking strategy

10:28.420 --> 10:31.046
involves you coming unshod behind.

10:31.214 --> 10:33.424
Now give me a fucking hoof.

10:33.591 --> 10:35.718
Yeah.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.887
There we go.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.724
(neighing)

10:41.891 --> 10:45.394
(sighs)
That's right.

10:46.563 --> 10:49.982
Harp and fucking criticize

10:50.150 --> 10:54.153
until there's a fucking
solution in the offing,

10:54.321 --> 10:56.822
and then become fucking obstinate.

10:56.990 --> 11:00.034
Now, for the last fucking time,

11:00.201 --> 11:04.580
give me a fucking hoof.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.549
Come sneaking up like an Injun.

11:15.717 --> 11:17.801
Can't wait on your boy
no longer, Miss Lady.

11:17.969 --> 11:20.220
Bow on that money
is the same one you tied.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.931
I'm grateful you waited
on him as long as you did.

11:23.099 --> 11:26.101
It ain't being none of my business
gonna stop me

11:26.269 --> 11:28.604
from asking how your boy's talk
with Hearst went.

11:28.772 --> 11:30.606
Odell gonna meet up
in New York City

11:30.774 --> 11:32.775
with a man works for Mr. Hearst.

11:32.942 --> 11:36.236
- Go back with him to Liberia.
- Ah.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.530
Odell say if Mr. Hearst wanted,

11:38.698 --> 11:41.575
he'd harm him here,
get to see the hurt he'd done.

11:41.743 --> 11:45.120
Well, your water broke open a damn
smart nigger, didn't it, Aunt Lou?

11:45.288 --> 11:47.873
You think there's sense to that?

11:48.041 --> 11:50.334
More than I've made since
I've learned to talk.

11:52.629 --> 11:55.297
No place I guess you can
hide a child from danger.

11:55.465 --> 11:59.385
If I knew, I'd keep that spot for myself.
(chuckles)

11:59.552 --> 12:01.512
And can I fix you
something to take away?

12:01.679 --> 12:04.973
- Something with meat and heat to it.
- Come on, stand next to me.

12:05.141 --> 12:09.311
- Here, let me get that for you.
- Thank you, sir.

12:12.190 --> 12:15.401
Myself and him over there,
my strong right arm,

12:15.568 --> 12:18.779
along with Tom Nuttall
that runs the Saloon No. 10,

12:18.947 --> 12:22.658
- was the first operators in this here camp.
- So.

12:22.826 --> 12:26.245
Turned the first card,
sold the first booze and snatch.

12:26.413 --> 12:29.123
Road agents, story goes,

12:29.290 --> 12:32.376
don't work these hills but by my leave.

12:32.544 --> 12:34.503
Which if that's true, explains why

12:34.671 --> 12:36.964
I'm fucking interested
in what you're telling.

12:37.132 --> 12:39.299
- So.
- So...

12:39.467 --> 12:41.927
go the fuck ahead
and tell me then.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.179
Me and my brother happened along

12:44.347 --> 12:47.349
and we balked some unknown parties

12:47.517 --> 12:49.977
who was having
a few shots at the stage.

12:50.145 --> 12:52.771
That's all.

12:52.939 --> 12:56.483
Ears flat back to the head,

12:56.651 --> 12:59.403
nose without boils, fucking modest--

12:59.571 --> 13:01.405
a proper hero, Dan.

13:01.573 --> 13:03.323
How many unknown parties?

13:03.491 --> 13:07.035
- Uh, two or maybe three.
- At what remove from you?

13:07.203 --> 13:09.788
- 100 feet and more.
- Describe 'em.

13:09.956 --> 13:13.333
Nah, they broke off.
We returned fire.

13:13.501 --> 13:14.835
Describe 'em.

13:15.003 --> 13:17.504
My meaning would be them firing,

13:17.672 --> 13:20.048
I didn't get a good fucking
look at them.

13:22.552 --> 13:26.513
I'd also say you're fucking free
with your reprehending tone.

13:35.398 --> 13:37.107
Drink?

13:37.275 --> 13:39.234
All right.

13:46.910 --> 13:50.621
My opinion--
it may come out of vanity--

13:50.788 --> 13:52.998
your tale's full of shit,

13:53.166 --> 13:58.295
I say, or else I'd have known of 'em.
There was no road agents.

13:58.463 --> 13:59.796
I say...

14:01.508 --> 14:05.636
to make a hero's entrance into camp,
you and your friend kicked up dust,

14:05.803 --> 14:08.805
whooped and hollered and played
all the parts yourselves.

14:10.642 --> 14:14.269
- Who is that with you?
- It's my brother.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.775
This was my idea.

14:23.071 --> 14:24.613
Any others?

14:24.781 --> 14:27.115
Not brothers, ideas--
how to pass your time in camp.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.284
I got a timber lease to work.

14:29.452 --> 14:33.080
- Come by how?
- Cards, last night in Custer City.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.629
Small chance that you want

14:40.797 --> 14:42.965
to explore options to working your lease,

14:43.132 --> 14:45.133
anyone hires your gun,
you report to me.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.135
I'll double what they're paying you.

14:47.303 --> 14:51.181
But your story ought
be true, you understand?

14:51.349 --> 14:54.893
I'll test the sense of it,

14:55.061 --> 14:57.312
that knows more of this place

14:57.480 --> 15:00.941
and I guess every other than you do.

15:03.695 --> 15:06.822
If you choose to fell the timber,

15:06.990 --> 15:09.658
axes, wedges, block and tackle

15:09.826 --> 15:13.078
sheriff has at the hardware store.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.832
(door opens)

15:17.000 --> 15:19.209
All right.

15:36.686 --> 15:39.521
- (door closes)
- You figure Hearst will take a run at him?

15:43.109 --> 15:45.861
Hmm. Good cooking,
big-hearted fat lady

15:46.029 --> 15:48.155
presiding over my rest,

15:48.323 --> 15:51.700
I wouldn't be headed
for San Francisco.

15:54.912 --> 15:57.122
She'd probably know
what I'm talking about--

15:57.290 --> 15:59.333
how the wicked live.

16:01.127 --> 16:04.963
And are always at fucking ease.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.967
Or just plain drunk before noon.

16:10.136 --> 16:12.512
(wheezing)

16:32.700 --> 16:34.951
Wyatt.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.996
Wyatt, this here's Jen,

16:38.164 --> 16:40.749
whose sister it turns out
the both of us have knowed--

16:40.917 --> 16:44.252
Mary Bess from
the Yellowbird in Gunnison.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.254
Even prettier.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.590
I was speaking to Jen of that $11 --

16:48.758 --> 16:50.926
We got to go acquire them tools.

16:51.094 --> 16:54.429
--that I loaned her sister?

16:54.597 --> 16:58.642
We was working out
the forgiveness of the debt.

17:02.438 --> 17:06.233
Well, you can work out
her forgiveness later.

17:19.955 --> 17:23.040
I thought we was gonna capitalize
on the good will we created.

17:23.209 --> 17:26.795
Seeing to our fucking capitalizing
means more than getting your end wet.

17:33.803 --> 17:35.095
Here.

17:35.263 --> 17:37.681
This will buy the tools
to cut our lumber.

17:37.849 --> 17:40.350
What are you going to do?

17:40.518 --> 17:42.769
The next fucking step of my plan.

17:42.937 --> 17:46.648
- To capitalize?
- You go ahead down to that hardware place.

17:46.816 --> 17:50.277
- I can see to the tree cutting and more.
- Only start with seeing to the trees.

17:50.445 --> 17:53.155
- Or don't you think I'm able?
- Jesus Christ, Morgan.

17:53.322 --> 17:57.909
- Now probably I'll be in this place.
- Well, what did he want upstairs?

17:58.077 --> 18:00.287
You ain't got time for me
to get into that.

18:13.009 --> 18:15.719
- Hearst: Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Hearst.

18:16.888 --> 18:20.515
Very constructive reminder
in this morning's edition.

18:20.683 --> 18:23.059
12 days to the election.

18:23.227 --> 18:25.896
Will you continue to show that calendar,

18:26.063 --> 18:28.690
uh, 11, 10 days, so on?

18:28.858 --> 18:31.234
Assuming my press stays intact.

18:31.402 --> 18:34.321
- (both laugh)
- Thanks, too, for publishing

18:34.489 --> 18:38.200
Sheriff Bullock's letter of condolence to
the family of that murdered worker of mine.

18:38.367 --> 18:39.868
Oh, you're welcome.

18:40.036 --> 18:42.537
I suppose I should
have written them myself.

18:42.705 --> 18:45.665
I'd not presume to suppose in that regard,
Mr. Hearst, one way or another.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.460
Was the sheriff's making his letter
part of the public record

18:48.628 --> 18:51.171
meant to embarrass or reproach me?

18:51.339 --> 18:53.381
I'd not suppose in that connection either.

18:53.549 --> 18:56.051
I'm to take you for majestically neutral?

18:56.219 --> 19:00.263
I'd make the less exalted claim,

19:00.431 --> 19:03.767
as a journalist, of keeping
my opinions to myself.

19:03.935 --> 19:06.645
You are less majestically neutral than--

19:06.813 --> 19:09.856
than cloaking your cowardice
in principle?

19:13.110 --> 19:17.030
I can only answer perhaps, Mr. Hearst,

19:17.198 --> 19:20.325
events have not yet disclosed
to me all that I am.

19:20.493 --> 19:23.745
Those kind of events could be
in the weather, Merrick.

19:23.913 --> 19:26.623
You might have a second
calendar for them.

19:41.138 --> 19:44.891
The fella all those hats was
up in the air about, Mr. T.

19:45.059 --> 19:46.518
Ah.

19:46.686 --> 19:49.604
Claims he drove off them road agents.

19:53.860 --> 19:57.153
Elrod Yulham
from Galena, Illinois.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.906
Uh, afraid not.

20:00.074 --> 20:04.035
Oh, I see now. You got more flare
about the nostrils than Elrod.

20:04.203 --> 20:07.122
Uh, this here gentleman's
a hero, Mr. Tolliver.

20:07.290 --> 20:11.209
Thwarted a band of brigands
attacking the stage out of Cheyenne.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.503
Leon:
Three, craps.

20:13.671 --> 20:15.964
Don't levy the man's wager, Leon.

20:16.132 --> 20:18.675
His throw got queered
by Con's chatter.

20:18.843 --> 20:20.510
Leon:
Last was no roll.

20:20.678 --> 20:23.221
Cy Tolliver, sir.
It's a honor to meet you.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.265
Thanks in the name of us all.

20:25.433 --> 20:27.809
We just happened to happen by.

20:27.977 --> 20:30.478
That's the first I hear of a we.

20:31.480 --> 20:34.983
- Six is the point. Point six.
- Well, I come into camp with my brother.

20:35.151 --> 20:38.278
Who would be where
at this present juncture?

20:38.446 --> 20:40.363
Well, we acquired a timber lease.

20:40.531 --> 20:42.532
He's out buying tools for us to work it.

20:42.700 --> 20:45.702
Tools to work a timber lease.
(chuckles)

20:45.870 --> 20:48.872
I guess you're even more a hero,

20:49.040 --> 20:51.333
guns being out of your line.

20:52.752 --> 20:56.254
I didn't call them
a fully foreign subject now.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.506
I see.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.217
I see.
(chuckles)

21:01.385 --> 21:03.303
Eight. Point six.

21:03.471 --> 21:06.181
Pay the man, Leon.

21:06.349 --> 21:09.017
But I didn't make my point.

21:09.185 --> 21:12.103
You did to me.

21:15.024 --> 21:16.858
We ought try...

21:17.026 --> 21:20.153
to cross the road...

21:20.321 --> 21:22.197
today.

21:22.365 --> 21:25.408
(wheezing)

21:27.078 --> 21:29.537
The thoroughfare's a menace.

21:29.705 --> 21:33.708
Ruts, sinkholes, quick slimes.

21:33.876 --> 21:36.711
(wet coughing)

21:43.886 --> 21:46.096
(gasping)

21:52.853 --> 21:56.147
You're the producer, Jack.

21:56.315 --> 22:00.068
You'll manage.

22:00.236 --> 22:04.155
(moans, wheezing)

22:20.715 --> 22:22.173
(moans)

22:25.594 --> 22:28.763
Forgive my presumption, sir.

22:28.931 --> 22:32.267
Have you lanceolate
pains hereabouts?

22:33.936 --> 22:35.353
Yes.

22:35.521 --> 22:38.815
Intermittent, but sudden,
sharp in onset,

22:38.983 --> 22:42.902
occasioned by a tilt of a shoulder,
a shift of weight?

22:43.070 --> 22:46.531
I may try ice-water dousing.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.366
Ah.

22:48.534 --> 22:51.244
A German doctor
in Virginia City urged me to it.

22:51.412 --> 22:54.247
A vogue, if you would
permit me to say,

22:54.415 --> 22:56.958
now quite exploded,

22:57.126 --> 23:01.337
even recognized
as possibly harmful.

23:01.505 --> 23:03.465
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:03.632 --> 23:06.634
The cold causing
too rapid and painful

23:06.802 --> 23:10.013
a contraction of muscles
already knotted in spasm.

23:10.181 --> 23:13.641
- I see.
- I am aware of a certain technique

23:13.809 --> 23:17.729
by whose virtue I was
gradually and by degrees

23:17.897 --> 23:20.315
relieved of a similar
suffering of my own.

23:20.483 --> 23:21.816
You are?

23:21.984 --> 23:25.737
Blessed by my pain's
entire remission

23:25.905 --> 23:28.114
for 15 years,

23:28.282 --> 23:30.200
one month and three days.
(chuckles)

23:30.367 --> 23:33.578
I dread the prospect
of ice-water dousing.

23:33.746 --> 23:37.499
Taught me by a former Odabashi
of the Turkish artillery,

23:37.666 --> 23:39.626
come himself to be afflicted

23:39.794 --> 23:43.671
through chronic lifting
of cast-iron cannonballs.

23:43.839 --> 23:46.341
Can you help me...
(coughs)

23:46.509 --> 23:47.842
who does not know your name?

23:48.010 --> 23:50.136
- John Langrishe, sir.
- Ah.

23:50.304 --> 23:51.679
Permit me to say

23:51.847 --> 23:55.308
you are known to me.

23:55.476 --> 23:57.018
- George Hearst.
- Yes.

23:57.186 --> 23:59.104
Oh, yes.

24:00.648 --> 24:04.484
Would later today be convenient
to start, George Hearst?

24:06.070 --> 24:08.822
Indeed.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.702
(grunts, chuckles)

24:29.677 --> 24:31.636
- Better today?
- No better...

24:31.804 --> 24:34.430
nor will be to take him
in a day to come.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.891
Be good enough
to inform the artisans

24:37.059 --> 24:39.561
they will not be renovating
after recess at the school.

24:39.728 --> 24:42.730
Prepare his transport.

24:42.898 --> 24:46.401
We are going to show him
the theater.

24:46.569 --> 24:49.571
- Will you help me?
- I've other fucking business.

24:52.032 --> 24:53.783
(dice rattling)

24:53.951 --> 24:55.910
(blows)

24:59.707 --> 25:02.375
Seven out.

25:02.543 --> 25:05.003
Wyatt:
Motherless whore.

25:06.255 --> 25:08.840
Speaking against
the establishment's interests,

25:09.008 --> 25:12.886
you might leave with a rosier outlook
still holding some of our money.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.896
(both chuckling)

25:23.063 --> 25:25.607
(sighs)

25:34.950 --> 25:37.035
Leon:
Big winner on the day.

25:39.371 --> 25:42.290
Well, those appear
to have propagated.

25:42.458 --> 25:44.751
(laughs)

25:46.003 --> 25:47.837
He worsens, Mrs. Bullock,

25:48.005 --> 25:50.548
never to improve, I'm afraid.

25:50.716 --> 25:52.675
I'm very sorry, Mr. Langrishe.

25:52.843 --> 25:56.471
Hope having postponed the old actor's
visit to what will be our theater,

25:56.639 --> 26:00.600
its abandonment now argues
the visit's urgent execution.

26:00.768 --> 26:03.228
- I understand.
- Forcing this directness upon me.

26:03.395 --> 26:06.481
When, Mrs. Bullock, today
will your classes stand in recess?

26:06.649 --> 26:09.150
How soon could you have him here?

26:09.318 --> 26:11.319
The logistics of his transport

26:11.487 --> 26:15.615
and the histrionics of his porter
may not make it till late this afternoon.

26:15.783 --> 26:18.201
I'll cancel the session
right after the recess.

26:18.369 --> 26:20.828
Bless you.

26:20.996 --> 26:23.581
And thanks

26:23.749 --> 26:25.333
(taps)

26:25.501 --> 26:27.710
Oh. Beautiful.

26:32.508 --> 26:35.635
- (softly) I got ammunition left.
- I see that.

26:38.305 --> 26:39.847
I didn't order any shotgun.

26:40.015 --> 26:42.684
I'm doing you the courtesy
of allowing you

26:42.851 --> 26:45.520
not to think I'm as stupid
as evidently you believe

26:45.688 --> 26:49.440
that girl off who you tore
that piece of pussy off of is.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.192
The girl's sister owed me money.

26:51.360 --> 26:54.237
From the Yellowbird in Gunnison.

26:54.405 --> 26:58.241
Well, Jen claims you worked
that information from her.

26:58.409 --> 27:00.618
- That her sister owed me money?
- Yeah.

27:00.786 --> 27:02.161
Did she tell you how I did it?

27:02.329 --> 27:04.622
'Cause I'd sure like to remember
for the next time I'm short.

27:04.790 --> 27:07.917
Worked it from her
at this very bar in idle chatter--

27:08.085 --> 27:11.212
having a sister who whored
at the Yellowbird in Gunnison,

27:11.380 --> 27:15.967
and only then alleged
the supposed owed $11.

27:16.135 --> 27:19.887
(whistles) How long you been
wearing shoes, Counselor?

27:20.055 --> 27:21.889
Did you fuck off the full 11?

27:22.057 --> 27:24.600
She claims $5 was owed,

27:24.768 --> 27:28.396
but my inkling
is the right total was seven.

27:49.293 --> 27:51.336
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.

27:52.796 --> 27:55.048
Where are the tools, Morgan?

27:55.215 --> 27:58.092
That is a story in itself.

28:02.931 --> 28:05.266
You say it weren't an ass fuck,

28:05.434 --> 28:08.227
I believe you.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.775
You buying those
goddamn tools or not?

28:13.942 --> 28:17.320
I wouldn't have chose them
not meaning to buy.

28:17.488 --> 28:19.322
As opposed to leaving chosen goods

28:19.490 --> 28:22.241
piled in the middle of the fucking store

28:22.409 --> 28:25.953
for every other piece of business
to be conducted over and around.

28:26.121 --> 28:30.458
It's customary to stand by
till the transaction's finished.

28:30.626 --> 28:32.627
Morgan:
I was called elsewhere.

28:32.795 --> 28:34.712
Seth:
"Elsewhere"-- meaning The Gem?

28:34.880 --> 28:38.091
You wouldn't be doubting
my brother's word?

28:46.308 --> 28:48.142
Pay for the tools and remove them,

28:48.310 --> 28:51.646
and I'll cease to doubt
your ability to do so.

28:53.190 --> 28:55.191
How's that?

29:16.255 --> 29:20.007
There is no losing in a match
like that, Mr. Hearst.

29:20.175 --> 29:22.760
- Never been much for draws.
- Well, I-- I--

29:22.928 --> 29:25.930
I meant to say,
let the matter be joined aright,

29:26.098 --> 29:30.226
whether Bullock or this gunsel stood at
the finish, there's no losing in it for you.

29:30.394 --> 29:32.353
What does "joined aright" mean?

29:32.521 --> 29:36.065
Say Bullock was first provoked
out the public eye,

29:36.233 --> 29:39.235
so his throwing down
in public seemed...

29:39.403 --> 29:41.112
overquick.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.448
There's all kinds of
implications to that,

29:43.615 --> 29:45.533
legal and political too.

29:45.701 --> 29:47.535
Have you taken steps

29:47.703 --> 29:50.538
to join this matter aright?

29:50.706 --> 29:54.792
Only steps I took so far, Mr. Hearst,
was to bring me into your presence.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.961
As to what steps will be required

29:57.129 --> 30:00.298
if you give the go-ahead,

30:00.466 --> 30:04.719
easy as the sheriff sparks
and cocky look as this kid wears,

30:04.887 --> 30:07.597
the number should be few.

30:09.892 --> 30:12.560
I would suggest,
to keep you fucking protected,

30:12.728 --> 30:14.937
that the kid should think I'm at the helm.

30:17.065 --> 30:20.151
Very circumspect.
Very considerate.

30:22.571 --> 30:25.072
- (knock on door)
- (coughing, wheezing)

30:26.325 --> 30:28.701
There are the blankets.

30:28.869 --> 30:30.786
Oh, there they are.
(chuckles)

30:31.955 --> 30:35.291
You are excused
by age and illness.

30:35.459 --> 30:37.418
I am simply stupid.

30:37.586 --> 30:39.754
Oh, no.
(chuckles)

30:39.922 --> 30:43.674
At a minimum,
unforgivably forgetful.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.343
My dear boy,

30:45.511 --> 30:47.470
we are here now,

30:47.638 --> 30:51.891
you and I and the blankets.

30:52.059 --> 30:54.101
- (wheezing, coughing)
- Yes yes. Um...

30:57.231 --> 31:01.734
I wonder where the chair would be
in which I'm to be transported.

31:01.902 --> 31:05.112
Oh, that the countess
and Claudia should be wheeling

31:05.280 --> 31:08.074
across the thoroughfare
even as we speak.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.911
(coughing)

31:25.551 --> 31:28.302
We shall swaddle you
like the baby Jesus,

31:28.470 --> 31:32.473
making the most simple
and economical of transactions

31:32.641 --> 31:34.475
to transfer you to the countess

31:34.643 --> 31:38.229
and Claudia's chair once they arrive.

31:38.397 --> 31:40.106
All right.

31:40.274 --> 31:42.525
All right.
(moans)

31:44.152 --> 31:47.572
Is he dying? Is he dead?

31:47.739 --> 31:49.907
He's in a bad fucking way.

31:56.665 --> 31:59.041
Here. Take that for
his care and burying.

31:59.209 --> 32:01.711
Let me get my fucking horse past.

32:01.878 --> 32:04.505
And let the bank know
someone don't take over this place

32:04.673 --> 32:07.675
- that loan they made Steve is going bad.
- Why don't you tell them?

32:07.843 --> 32:10.219
'Cause I'm a nigger, Doc,
that don't care what stands or falls.

32:10.387 --> 32:13.347
- Hostetler was too.
- Hostetler was taller than me.

32:18.895 --> 32:21.856
Fuck you, Steve.

32:22.024 --> 32:23.858
Fuck you, Hostetler.

32:26.111 --> 32:28.112
And fuck you too!

32:30.365 --> 32:35.328
I can ask Jane Cannary
to see to keeping him comfortable.

32:36.455 --> 32:39.206
See to her bringing back
a bottle while you're at it.

32:39.374 --> 32:43.669
I'll linger, look to these animals
till the bank sends someone over.

32:52.262 --> 32:54.555
That chair is hotel property.

32:54.723 --> 32:59.602
I will deal with the bathhouse
administrator, believe you me.

32:59.770 --> 33:03.939
- Shoo. Shoo.
- Where have you been?

33:04.107 --> 33:06.651
Pushing this contraption
through the muck.

33:06.818 --> 33:09.612
To the bathhouse, it was on loan.

33:09.780 --> 33:13.199
(snickers) Wait till you see
what they do there.

33:13.367 --> 33:15.034
Stay right there, Bellegarde.

33:15.202 --> 33:16.994
We're already knee-deep in shit.

33:17.162 --> 33:19.038
(both groan)

33:19.206 --> 33:21.082
Are those assholes working for you?

33:21.249 --> 33:25.252
- Those heroes that saved the stage?
- That Dority collected.

33:25.420 --> 33:29.715
Once he confessed to the stretch,
I put the one on a fucking string.

33:32.260 --> 33:34.095
$200 in merchandise

33:34.262 --> 33:37.515
in the middle of our store
like an interrupted shit.

33:37.683 --> 33:41.143
Commerce. Every hump
above ground's your master.

33:43.230 --> 33:45.898
- That letter was a fucking mistake.
- No.

33:46.066 --> 33:49.527
I'm not waiting on Hearst,
I'll tell you that right now.

33:49.695 --> 33:51.779
I am not on his fucking timetable,

33:51.947 --> 33:53.656
or at his fucking beck and call.

33:53.824 --> 33:57.243
- (knocks)
- Yeah?

33:57.411 --> 33:58.828
AW Merrick, Al.

33:58.995 --> 34:01.622
Cheyenne and Black Hills Telegraph.

34:01.790 --> 34:04.417
Is Sheriff Bullock inside?

34:06.420 --> 34:08.462
Only briefly. He's out of sorts

34:08.630 --> 34:10.630
and going downstairs for a blowjob.

34:12.842 --> 34:15.010
Al:
Come in for fuck's sake!

34:21.643 --> 34:23.351
Telegram for Sheriff Bullock.

34:23.520 --> 34:26.272
What reaction to your publication
of Bullock's letter?

34:26.440 --> 34:29.984
The great man himself took umbrage.

34:30.152 --> 34:33.027
It was not a mistake,

34:33.196 --> 34:35.197
and we are waiting on Hearst.

34:35.364 --> 34:38.199
Unless you think those
two assholes are his response.

34:42.664 --> 34:44.915
Not likely.

34:49.337 --> 34:51.755
(Blazanov clears throat)

34:51.922 --> 34:55.926
Uh, the sheriff is going for blowjob?

35:07.522 --> 35:10.024
Now having paid,

35:10.192 --> 35:12.067
may we leave our tools here

35:12.235 --> 35:14.945
till we go out tomorrow to our lease?

35:15.113 --> 35:17.615
I've had a wire...

35:17.783 --> 35:21.076
says your statement is true,
far as having worked as a lawman.

35:21.244 --> 35:23.287
Not asking why you've put
the work aside,

35:23.455 --> 35:26.874
I'll say only some that do find themselves
ready and uniquely able

35:27.042 --> 35:29.418
to work the other side of the street.

35:31.880 --> 35:34.507
Some do that.

35:49.773 --> 35:53.234
I took the badge off myself once...

35:53.401 --> 35:56.737
without losing my impulse
to beat on certain types.

36:00.075 --> 36:02.493
No, that seems never to go.

36:13.922 --> 36:15.923
- (knocks)
- Not now!

36:16.091 --> 36:18.259
Lou: Could I come back
soon then, Mr. Hearst?

36:18.426 --> 36:20.094
God damn it.

36:20.262 --> 36:22.763
Come in, Aunt Lou.
Come in now.

36:25.684 --> 36:27.560
Boots are in the corner.

36:29.813 --> 36:32.648
I'd pay a man three weeks
of my wages, Mr. Hearst,

36:32.816 --> 36:35.818
rode quick to catch my son
and give him this from his mama.

36:35.986 --> 36:38.279
Searched and searched
before he left.

36:38.446 --> 36:41.115
Come to find it with him gone.

36:43.285 --> 36:46.203
A lovely garnet.
It does seem a moral law

36:46.371 --> 36:48.455
we find what we seek only tardily.

36:48.623 --> 36:50.332
Would you send somebody, sir?

36:55.130 --> 36:57.590
My imagination resists the approach,

36:57.757 --> 37:01.051
in that however quickly
he might catch Odell,

37:01.219 --> 37:05.222
until he did, the man would know he rode
in the service of a colored person.

37:07.350 --> 37:10.394
I'd suggest, having packed
the brooch carefully and securely,

37:10.562 --> 37:12.771
we ship it to New York,
where my man Fitzpatrick

37:12.939 --> 37:15.649
can give it to your son
when he arrives.

37:17.152 --> 37:18.485
All right.

37:18.653 --> 37:22.823
Are you afraid that by his
not receiving today

37:22.991 --> 37:24.867
the token of your love,

37:25.035 --> 37:28.454
something untoward
might befall Odell?

37:28.622 --> 37:31.957
Are you superstitious
that way, Aunt Lou?

37:39.341 --> 37:42.718
Thanks for seeing to those.
It's the reason I thought you'd knocked.

37:55.106 --> 37:57.358
Maybe we should head
out for the lease.

37:58.693 --> 38:01.236
Well, now has the sun rose
since last I looked?

38:01.404 --> 38:05.115
Or more than you let on previous,
do you even know the path we're going?

38:05.283 --> 38:08.243
No, I do not fucking know.

38:10.413 --> 38:14.458
Second look, he don't seem such
a bad sort, that fucking sheriff.

38:14.626 --> 38:18.671
Maybe we ought to be fucking deputies,
work our lease on the fucking side.

38:18.838 --> 38:21.382
Well, did you hear him offer us work?

38:21.549 --> 38:23.759
Well, then let's kill him and take his job.

38:25.470 --> 38:28.931
Wyatt: On the other hand,
here is a man who might be about to.

38:29.099 --> 38:32.977
The one that has a plan for you
that factors into yours for us?

38:33.144 --> 38:37.982
- Do not fucking turn around, Morgan.
- (whispers) I thought he didn't show up.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.234
- (Wyatt clears throat)
- Well well.

38:40.402 --> 38:42.861
This the hero brother I heard about?

38:43.029 --> 38:46.323
This is him-- Morgan Earp.

38:46.491 --> 38:50.327
Morgan, meet Mr. Tolliver,
who operates the joint.

38:50.495 --> 38:52.413
- How do you do, Morgan?
- How do you do?

38:52.580 --> 38:56.083
- What a beautiful fucking joint.
- Well, we'd like to think so.

39:00.380 --> 39:02.715
Come on, you fucknut.

39:05.927 --> 39:08.262
Without a day's education,

39:08.430 --> 39:10.264
medical or otherwise,

39:10.432 --> 39:13.684
I vouchsafe this fucking truth:
Those as don't eat

39:13.852 --> 39:17.229
without exception fail to survive.

39:18.982 --> 39:21.692
(sighs)

39:23.862 --> 39:25.946
Fuck ya.

39:26.114 --> 39:28.949
(sighs)

39:29.117 --> 39:31.118
He's all yours.

39:32.454 --> 39:34.747
Thanks for your help.

39:34.914 --> 39:36.915
Yup.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.385
You heard the lady, Steve.

39:49.637 --> 39:52.681
Them that goes on
have got to fucking eat.

39:54.225 --> 39:57.686
Cocksucker.
(laughing)

39:57.854 --> 39:59.938
Cocksucker.

40:00.106 --> 40:03.484
Do for me, Mr. Hearst,

40:03.651 --> 40:06.111
and much more for yourself,

40:06.279 --> 40:09.615
this one important thing.

40:11.159 --> 40:15.120
Breathe, sir.

40:15.288 --> 40:18.248
Breathe deeply,

40:18.416 --> 40:20.626
hungrily,

40:20.794 --> 40:24.546
as if your life depended on it.

40:25.590 --> 40:27.508
(inhales rapidly)

40:27.675 --> 40:31.053
And yet slowly,

40:31.221 --> 40:34.181
as with the rhythm of the waves

40:34.349 --> 40:36.975
of the sea.

40:43.525 --> 40:46.026
The while, Mr. Hearst,

40:46.194 --> 40:47.945
allowing influx

40:48.113 --> 40:52.199
of my motion's heat.

40:54.828 --> 40:57.246
Do you begin to feel it, man?

40:59.124 --> 41:00.874
- (muffled) I think so.
- Hmm?

41:01.042 --> 41:02.709
I said I think so.

41:02.877 --> 41:04.628
Then too...

41:04.796 --> 41:08.423
begin to feel this:

41:09.551 --> 41:13.178
One towards the neck

41:13.346 --> 41:18.016
and one towards the coccyx.

41:21.771 --> 41:23.397
- Ooh!
- What?

41:23.565 --> 41:25.607
- My God!
- Are you all right?

41:25.775 --> 41:28.569
- I am. How are you?
- Ah.

41:28.736 --> 41:31.280
- Some release in tension?
- Ja.

41:31.447 --> 41:33.490
Yes.

41:33.658 --> 41:36.743
(laughs)
Yes, by God.

41:36.911 --> 41:39.288
Is the pain diminished
in some measure?

41:39.455 --> 41:41.039
It is.

41:41.207 --> 41:42.583
(groans)

41:42.750 --> 41:44.334
(gasping)

41:53.428 --> 41:55.137
Now lie still, sir.

41:55.305 --> 41:58.348
- (groans)
- As your nodals

41:58.516 --> 42:00.642
settle to the adjustment.

42:00.810 --> 42:03.103
Try to sleep.

42:03.271 --> 42:05.939
I don't want to sleep.
I'm waiting for something.

42:06.107 --> 42:08.609
Very well, please yourself.

42:20.955 --> 42:22.289
Ow.

42:22.457 --> 42:26.001
Second look, she may have
decided it didn't suit.

42:26.169 --> 42:28.295
This hasn't said...

42:28.463 --> 42:31.423
anything yet to spare my feelings.

42:31.591 --> 42:34.468
I don't believe Mrs. Bullock
is that sort.

42:34.636 --> 42:36.970
I believe them theater people

42:37.138 --> 42:39.598
not moving in yet, she feels no call

42:39.766 --> 42:42.643
to disrupt her education activities

42:42.810 --> 42:44.645
by moving the children out yet from

42:44.812 --> 42:47.439
the Chez Amis into this place here.

42:47.607 --> 42:50.275
In other words,

42:50.443 --> 42:52.694
exactly what she said.

42:52.862 --> 42:55.530
Does it trouble you,

42:55.698 --> 42:57.532
keeping watch on a dark place?

42:57.700 --> 43:00.327
No, ma'am, it does not.

43:01.704 --> 43:03.789
Especially when I know

43:03.957 --> 43:06.375
there's light coming to it.

43:56.718 --> 43:58.385
One sorry-ass...

44:01.347 --> 44:03.974
shit-eating cocksucker.

44:08.855 --> 44:12.316
Claudia and the countess
have embroidered the tabs in gold:

44:13.526 --> 44:16.778
Thalia and Melpomene.

44:19.574 --> 44:21.408
Big lie...

44:21.576 --> 44:24.244
the masks.

44:24.412 --> 44:27.956
Same damn thing, Jack--

44:28.124 --> 44:32.627
comedy and tragedy.

44:33.963 --> 44:35.797
The curtain rises.

44:35.965 --> 44:39.301
The stage is set before us.

44:42.972 --> 44:45.640
What's the rake?

44:46.642 --> 44:49.394
18 to one, old trouper.

44:49.562 --> 44:51.480
Ohh.

44:57.278 --> 44:59.404
Dost thou know Dover?

45:01.616 --> 45:04.117
There is a cliff

45:04.285 --> 45:07.537
whose high unbending head

45:07.705 --> 45:10.999
looks fearfully on the confined deep.

45:12.502 --> 45:15.462
Bring me back to the brim of it,

45:15.630 --> 45:18.131
and from that place

45:18.299 --> 45:21.968
I shall no leading need.

45:23.805 --> 45:26.765
Here's the fly tower.

45:26.933 --> 45:29.643
If you mount up,

45:29.811 --> 45:33.438
take firm a rail in each hand.

45:45.159 --> 45:48.328
I'll boost your bum, darling.

45:56.504 --> 45:59.339
Here's the place.

46:03.136 --> 46:05.637
How fearful and dizzy it is

46:05.805 --> 46:09.516
to cast one's eyes so low.

46:11.018 --> 46:15.856
Set me where you stand.

46:19.110 --> 46:22.028
Let go my hand.

46:29.370 --> 46:31.913
You're now

46:32.081 --> 46:35.041
within a foot.

46:37.628 --> 46:40.255
Line.

46:51.225 --> 46:53.768
L-line.

47:05.823 --> 47:07.157
(sighs)

47:07.325 --> 47:10.619
Our Father which art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

47:16.250 --> 47:18.251
He's gone.

47:28.012 --> 47:29.804
We'll see to him now.

47:40.233 --> 47:42.776
- (cheers)
- Winner 10! 10 as hard as they come.

47:42.944 --> 47:45.445
That is my big brother,
who I'm going to be assisting

47:45.613 --> 47:48.365
on some very important business
for the man you work for,

47:48.533 --> 47:50.617
and for whom
I may put in a good word for you

47:50.785 --> 47:52.619
depending on how good you are to me.

47:52.787 --> 47:54.204
- (giggles)
- Whoo-hoo!

47:54.372 --> 47:56.498
You seem blue, Jack.

47:58.751 --> 48:01.378
That old actor I spoke of

48:01.546 --> 48:03.547
passed.

48:03.714 --> 48:05.215
Sorry.

48:05.383 --> 48:07.551
Wrapped like a mummy
in blankets,

48:07.718 --> 48:12.180
drowning in his own fluids.

48:17.895 --> 48:22.148
Perhaps, Al, given
the sleigh ride which ensues,

48:22.316 --> 48:24.818
the best connection to Leviathan

48:24.986 --> 48:27.279
may not be by harpoon.

48:27.446 --> 48:29.322
Explain yourself.

48:29.490 --> 48:31.199
I mean the inimical Mr. Hearst

48:31.367 --> 48:33.868
suffering with discomfort at his back,

48:34.036 --> 48:37.205
the wiles of a bullshitter such as oneself

48:37.373 --> 48:40.625
may have use as a feint to occupy him.

48:40.793 --> 48:42.168
How?

48:42.336 --> 48:44.296
Campaign towards relief

48:44.463 --> 48:47.299
protracted, punctuated by

48:47.466 --> 48:49.426
Pentecostal whoops

48:49.594 --> 48:51.511
and manual pushes and prods while

48:51.679 --> 48:54.097
invoking arcane authorities--

48:54.265 --> 48:58.268
the host's unhealthy soul

48:58.436 --> 49:01.521
reliable to sustain his symptoms.

49:22.710 --> 49:26.921
You were good to try a net
on that cocksucker, Jack,

49:27.089 --> 49:30.508
on such a sorry day.

49:32.970 --> 49:35.555
Mr. Hearst!

49:35.723 --> 49:38.767
Are we still in a state of respite?

49:41.062 --> 49:45.065
The odd twinge, Mr. Langrishe,
but overall much improved.

49:45.232 --> 49:47.067
A winning skirmish

49:47.234 --> 49:49.486
in a long campaign!

49:52.490 --> 49:54.741
Mr. Swearengen.

49:54.909 --> 49:56.576
Mr. Hearst.

49:57.745 --> 50:00.288
Old friends!

50:00.456 --> 50:04.000
- (laughs)
- (chuckles)

50:04.168 --> 50:07.671
Don't imbibe overmuch
the evening chill.

50:09.256 --> 50:11.174
Waiting for something.

50:18.474 --> 50:20.892
It appears the theater people's
moving in

50:21.060 --> 50:24.062
was delayed by the illness
of one of their troupe,

50:24.230 --> 50:27.107
who today, I believe, has died.

50:27.274 --> 50:30.485
So they should be moving in
very shortly.

50:32.613 --> 50:34.739
Thank you for telling me...

50:38.661 --> 50:40.995
...without quarrel.

50:49.004 --> 50:53.133
And you acknowledge
your lack of sweetness

50:53.300 --> 50:55.635
on retiring last evening?

50:58.222 --> 51:00.056
I do,

51:00.224 --> 51:03.268
being uneasy about
my letter's publication.

51:03.436 --> 51:06.229
And Mr. Hearst's reaction.

51:06.397 --> 51:09.649
- (sighs)
- (hoofbeats approaching)

51:09.817 --> 51:13.737
Perhaps tonight will be twice as sweet.

51:16.824 --> 51:18.992
(whinnying)

51:20.453 --> 51:22.746
Sweet mother of Jesus.

51:34.049 --> 51:35.216
Hiyah!

51:35.384 --> 51:37.719
Take them amateurs off
the fucking sugar tit.

51:37.887 --> 51:40.847
Mr. Hearst brought the pros to town.

51:43.392 --> 51:46.519
Leviathan fucking smiles.

51:53.235 --> 51:55.737
