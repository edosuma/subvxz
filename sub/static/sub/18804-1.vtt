02:04.707 --> 02:09.752
The planet New Namek, where the
Namekians settled upon leaving Earth,

02:09.838 --> 02:13.257
is suddenly attacked by
an unidentified planet,

02:13.341 --> 02:18.262
and the Namekians now all
face the danger of extinction.

02:18.346 --> 02:22.933
Now, Dende, who has
become the new Kami over Earth,

02:23.017 --> 02:25.602
has learned of the
danger his friends are in,

02:25.687 --> 02:29.940
and has called upon Goku
and the others to save them.

02:37.198 --> 02:40.909
Kami-sama, you just
need to have faith in Goku.

02:42.745 --> 02:43.954
Popo-san...

02:45.790 --> 02:48.834
Goku-san... everyone...

02:59.929 --> 03:05.267
Break through the shining
clouds, and fly away (fly away)

03:05.351 --> 03:12.274
As a panorama spreads
itself throughout my being

03:12.358 --> 03:17.696
The earth, having been kicked
in the face, gets angry (angry)

03:17.780 --> 03:24.786
And makes one of its volcanoes explode!

03:24.871 --> 03:30.834
If, within the thawed polar ice,

03:30.919 --> 03:40.010
There is a dinosaur, then l want
to train him to balance atop a ball.

03:40.094 --> 03:43.639
CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA

03:43.723 --> 03:52.648
No matter what may happen, l feel
as though nothing can bother me,

03:52.732 --> 03:56.151
CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA

03:56.236 --> 04:02.074
However hard your chest pounds,
the Genki Dama will roar!

04:02.158 --> 04:05.702
CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA

04:05.787 --> 04:14.670
The emptier your head is, the more
room there is to pack with dreams,

04:14.754 --> 04:18.130
CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA

04:18.216 --> 04:25.138
With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,
today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...

04:25.223 --> 04:27.224
Sparking!

04:57.338 --> 05:00.299
We have to eat, or else we can't
keep our strength up, you know!

05:01.801 --> 05:06.638
--That's right!
--Well, with Goku along, this
will be settled in two shakes.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.474
Let's just enjoy this
space travel to its fullest!

05:09.559 --> 05:13.061
l wonder what kind of
planet New Namek is like.

05:13.146 --> 05:17.899
Yeah. This ain't something you can study
at school, so get a good look around.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.652
That will delight Chichi too!

05:20.737 --> 05:22.112
Right!

05:23.072 --> 05:27.159
Of all the... Bulma coaxed me
into goin' this far outta the way,

05:27.243 --> 05:30.662
an ' it don 't even look like
we'll be needin' Senzu this time.

05:30.747 --> 05:33.081
That's the truth! That's the truth!

05:33.166 --> 05:35.876
Hey, is he all right?

05:37.128 --> 05:39.963
Yeah! He doesn 't eat.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.935
Aren't we there yet?

06:57.708 --> 07:00.544
W- what is that?

07:05.133 --> 07:07.676
The one planet is
smooching on the other one!

07:07.760 --> 07:10.470
Do planets really kiss and stuff?

07:10.555 --> 07:14.015
Stop jibberin' ' bout anythin' that stupid!

07:14.100 --> 07:16.643
That one planet is eating...

07:16.727 --> 07:20.147
That can't be! To think that
one planet would eat another!

07:20.231 --> 07:22.774
lt doesn't even look all that tasty.

07:24.861 --> 07:25.861
Okay, let's go!

08:21.167 --> 08:22.959
Dammit...

08:27.173 --> 08:29.007
W- wait!

08:58.496 --> 09:00.080
lt's you!

09:04.001 --> 09:06.419
Who are you guys!?

09:09.048 --> 09:12.467
Gohan-san! Then you have come for us!

09:15.721 --> 09:18.473
Release the Namekians.

09:20.518 --> 09:24.062
You guys are better off giving up now!

09:24.146 --> 09:27.357
He's the strongest guy
in the universe, you know!

09:36.617 --> 09:39.160
l don 't want any needless fighting.

09:39.245 --> 09:43.290
Set the Namekians free,
and go back to your own planet!

09:46.961 --> 09:49.087
We' ll let it go this one time.

09:49.171 --> 09:51.298
You 'd better hurry up and go home, though!

09:51.382 --> 09:53.758
Face this way an ' say so!

09:54.552 --> 09:57.262
l guess life isn't always that easy, huh?

09:57.346 --> 09:59.931
He is right, Son Goku!

10:37.345 --> 10:39.012
Y- you 're...

10:39.096 --> 10:40.472
Coola!

10:42.725 --> 10:44.309
l- impossible!

10:49.357 --> 10:51.566
l- isn 't he dead?

11:02.578 --> 11:05.789
Lousy monkey! l 'd like to
say that you 'd done well,

11:05.873 --> 11:08.708
but l am the strongest in the universe!

11:34.735 --> 11:42.492
Kamehame-

11:42.576 --> 11:44.411
Ha!

12:09.145 --> 12:12.188
However, l have come back like this,

12:12.273 --> 12:15.734
through the advanced
technology of the Big Gete Star.

12:17.445 --> 12:20.488
And all the more powered up.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.074
Big Gete Star?

12:23.159 --> 12:26.786
That strange planet that has
attached itself to this one?

12:26.871 --> 12:31.458
You Namekian piece of scum.
To think that even you survived.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.042
This is perfect.

12:33.127 --> 12:37.839
l was planning on coming to Earth
anyhow to dispatch this monkey.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.632
You 've all saved me some trouble.

12:39.717 --> 12:43.136
lt's you who have saved us the trouble.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.806
How can he still be alive!?
We shouldn't have come after all.

12:46.891 --> 12:50.477
l want to go back to Earth!

12:50.561 --> 12:54.481
lt's already too late! You should
be takin ' after the Turtle Hermit!

12:54.565 --> 12:56.900
He's takin ' this pretty calm.

12:59.570 --> 13:03.490
How about we leave this to Goku
and the others and head home?

13:06.494 --> 13:07.452
Here they come!

13:11.123 --> 13:12.290
Kuririn-san!

13:12.374 --> 13:13.792
They' re fast!

13:34.730 --> 13:37.690
lt would appear as if your
abilities have grown considerably.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.109
That's right.

13:56.126 --> 13:58.461
l- l want to get back to Earth quick!

13:58.546 --> 14:02.674
You numbskull! lf you wanna get back
home alive, find yerself somewhere's to hide!

14:04.718 --> 14:06.511
Aah! Here it comes!

14:18.732 --> 14:21.484
D- did 'ja get 'im?

14:21.569 --> 14:23.778
Ee-yow-ow-ow-ow!!

14:27.157 --> 14:29.492
Lemme outta here, you scumbucket!

14:29.577 --> 14:30.869
l 'm not a fish, here!

14:30.953 --> 14:34.455
Whatever happened to Muten Roshi,
master of the martial arts!?

14:34.540 --> 14:35.832
Hey, back off!

14:54.226 --> 14:55.602
Outstanding.

16:05.130 --> 16:06.631
Are you okay, Gohan?

16:06.715 --> 16:09.467
Yes, but their defenses
are too strong for me.

16:09.551 --> 16:12.887
Y- yeah, they're just
shrugging off our usual attacks.

16:16.725 --> 16:18.476
Piccolo-san!

16:18.560 --> 16:21.270
That's no ordinary armor they've got.

16:21.355 --> 16:25.149
Concentrate your Ki to its
maximum at your point of strike!

16:33.158 --> 16:34.659
There's even more of them!

16:38.956 --> 16:40.581
Concentrate, huh?

16:41.709 --> 16:42.875
Let's go!

17:12.156 --> 17:14.073
lt's all or nothing!

17:20.122 --> 17:22.623
W- why is it just me?

17:26.712 --> 17:27.837
Dammit!

17:38.140 --> 17:39.515
l got him!

19:10.149 --> 19:11.566
Gohan!

19:30.544 --> 19:31.919
Piccolo-san!

19:42.556 --> 19:43.973
G- Gohan...

21:09.142 --> 21:13.145
What's the matter?
You cannot beat me at this level!

21:33.709 --> 21:35.459
Damn...

21:50.142 --> 21:53.644
Not even l was able to see him move.

21:53.729 --> 21:55.646
What did you do!?

22:01.570 --> 22:03.779
Something l call lnstantaneous Movement.

22:03.864 --> 22:07.491
What? Then you can do it too?

22:07.576 --> 22:08.534
Me too?

22:15.125 --> 22:16.292
You too, huh?

23:18.730 --> 23:22.775
So, you finally show
yourself, Super Saiyan?

23:22.859 --> 23:26.695
lf you hadn't, this would have been dull.

23:26.780 --> 23:29.073
This is how it will be decided...

23:31.952 --> 23:34.954
Who the strongest man in the universe is!

23:49.136 --> 23:50.845
Are you finished now?

24:28.133 --> 24:30.551
Guess l put more power
into that than l intended.

24:44.149 --> 24:46.901
So that's the Big Gete Star?

25:16.556 --> 25:19.517
lt's not my fault if this destroys you!

25:54.135 --> 25:56.053
Any defect l have is immediately reinforced

25:56.137 --> 26:01.308
and restored by the
Big Gete Star's main computer.

26:03.144 --> 26:08.107
Even as you frantically try to defeat
me, l can be restored countless times,

26:08.191 --> 26:11.485
even stronger than before!

26:11.570 --> 26:15.281
ln other words, you can never defeat me.

26:18.118 --> 26:20.452
Even if l blow you to smithereens?

26:20.537 --> 26:22.788
lf you can do so, take your shot!

26:55.155 --> 26:59.825
What's the matter?
Where did all that energy you just had go?

27:04.914 --> 27:08.417
You 're finished, Super Saiyan.

27:24.142 --> 27:26.727
Don't you take us Saiyans so lightly.

27:29.147 --> 27:30.898
What?

27:30.982 --> 27:34.068
l- l owe you one, Vegeta.

27:34.152 --> 27:37.071
There are two Super Saiyans!?

27:37.155 --> 27:42.368
Don't take it the wrong way, Kakarrot!
l did not come here to save you.

27:42.452 --> 27:45.287
l will be the one that
defeats you, after all.

27:46.539 --> 27:49.667
No matter how many of you
monkeys there are, it's all the same.

27:49.751 --> 27:53.128
l 'll send you into the next world together!

27:53.713 --> 27:55.547
You 'll be sorry!

28:28.123 --> 28:30.040
Damn dirty bastard!

28:30.125 --> 28:32.668
Big Bang Attack!

29:05.702 --> 29:10.622
Okay, silence! Silence! Silence, everyone!

29:10.707 --> 29:14.543
Okay, we are now going to mash all of you up!

29:17.130 --> 29:23.510
The life energy that is released will all
become energy for the Big Gete Star here.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.637
You should be thankful.

29:25.722 --> 29:27.890
You gotta be kiddin '!

29:30.560 --> 29:34.062
Okay, so nice that you are so spirited!

29:34.147 --> 29:35.647
You will be first.

29:36.733 --> 29:40.277
You jackass! Stop this!

29:51.122 --> 29:52.539
Gohan!

29:57.712 --> 30:00.547
Oh! lt seems we have another guest!

30:07.138 --> 30:08.889
Y- you 're...

30:18.733 --> 30:24.488
Rotten freak! My power is dropping,
and yet he's still all composed!

30:27.700 --> 30:29.868
Can you move, Vegeta?

30:29.953 --> 30:33.330
D- don 't take that familiar tone with me!

30:35.124 --> 30:40.045
lf we keep going like this,
we'll certainly be killed...

30:40.129 --> 30:43.048
T- there ain 't going to be anything after...

30:43.132 --> 30:46.051
lf the two of us were to attack
him together at full power...

30:46.135 --> 30:48.303
Don't tell me what to do!

30:49.138 --> 30:51.306
T- that's the spirit!

30:53.142 --> 30:57.646
Here he comes! Ready? Full power!

30:57.730 --> 31:00.190
Don't you tell me what to do!

31:50.950 --> 31:52.910
Disappear, and cease to exist!

32:19.145 --> 32:23.440
l 've used up almost all my power...

33:15.827 --> 33:19.454
W- we were just barely able to defeat him...

33:19.539 --> 33:22.040
W- what the hell is going on?

33:22.125 --> 33:26.253
These Coolas,
including the one you defeated,

33:26.337 --> 33:28.797
were all born of the grand
technology of the Big Gete Star!

33:28.881 --> 33:32.884
l wonder if you have the power left to fight

33:32.969 --> 33:36.555
now that this many
Metal Coolas have turned against you.

33:40.143 --> 33:42.477
l guess there's nothing to do but fight...

33:42.562 --> 33:44.980
Damn, l 'm getting dizzy...

33:52.572 --> 33:53.739
Here they come!

34:04.125 --> 34:06.168
Damn it all to hell!

34:24.187 --> 34:26.480
Welcome to the Big Gete Star.

34:26.563 --> 34:29.649
C- Coola! Where are you!?

34:29.734 --> 34:32.485
l am what you see before your eyes.

34:32.570 --> 34:33.737
What?

34:36.908 --> 34:39.909
Long ago, there was a certain computer chip

34:39.994 --> 34:45.456
adrift among some abandoned spaceships
and satellites in a " space graveyard. "

34:45.541 --> 34:51.463
Over a long time, under its own
capacity, it began to propagate.

34:51.547 --> 34:54.507
lt began to take in everything from space,

34:54.592 --> 35:00.055
and grew by absorbing
that energy for its own.

35:00.139 --> 35:04.267
This giant machine planet, now
capable of consuming even entire planets,

35:04.352 --> 35:07.646
is the Big Gete Star.

35:07.730 --> 35:11.483
And, as my brain was lucky
enough to wash up inside this planet,

35:11.567 --> 35:17.072
l merged with the main computer.
l became its core and now govern it.

35:17.156 --> 35:23.453
Further, l made it regenerate my now
mostly missing body as Metal Coola.

35:23.538 --> 35:27.457
What do you mean to do with us!?

35:27.542 --> 35:33.505
l 'm going to take all of that exceptional
Super Saiyan life energy of yours away from you!

35:33.798 --> 35:35.173
What!?

35:35.550 --> 35:39.803
With this, l will be able to keep
many thousands of Metal Super Saiyans!

35:46.561 --> 35:48.353
Y- you monster!

35:50.106 --> 35:52.816
Great! Suck out even more!

36:25.558 --> 36:28.476
Looks like l 've sucked them dry.

36:28.561 --> 36:31.688
To think that Super Saiyans
had this much energy!

36:31.772 --> 36:35.317
lf l had kept drawing out any more,
it would have been dangerous for me.

36:44.952 --> 36:47.329
W- what? What was that!?

36:48.206 --> 36:51.041
You mean there is something left?

36:51.125 --> 36:55.879
Stop! That circuit is supposed to be
closed! Why does it keep flowing in?

37:04.722 --> 37:08.683
Stop! lt's overheating! l ' m at my limit!

37:16.150 --> 37:56.314
S- stop!

37:58.567 --> 38:01.486
Yajirobe-san, please hang in there!

38:01.570 --> 38:05.448
An ' how am l s'posed to be hangin' in here!?

38:05.533 --> 38:09.619
Cut and slice and mash up! Cut and sl-

38:23.551 --> 38:25.427
Everyone! Quickly, quickly!

38:31.559 --> 38:32.934
You 're kidding, right?

38:42.570 --> 38:43.737
Gohan!

38:47.867 --> 38:51.036
This place is no longer safe!
We' re getting out of here!

38:51.120 --> 38:52.746
Piccolo-san!

39:17.563 --> 39:21.066
Controls aren 't responding!
The planet is separating!

39:21.150 --> 39:27.030
l had no idea a Super Saiyan's life energy
was something as extraordinary as this!

39:27.114 --> 39:32.035
l- it looks like your mistake
was to underestimate our power...

39:32.119 --> 39:34.621
Father!

39:34.705 --> 39:37.040
Goku!

39:37.124 --> 39:42.629
Everybody, get out of here now!
l 'll come once l take care of this guy!

39:42.713 --> 39:44.881
Son! Are you...

39:46.550 --> 39:49.010
ln your shape, you dare say such a thing!?

39:53.724 --> 39:57.102
Gohan! We' re taking
everyone and getting out of here!

40:24.338 --> 40:26.339
F- Father...

40:29.552 --> 40:32.470
You 're a fine one to say what
will happen in your shape as well!

40:32.555 --> 40:36.474
Those shiny other Coolas
won 't be coming to help you!

40:36.559 --> 40:40.478
Hmph! My power hasn 't dropped all that much!

40:40.563 --> 40:44.065
And l can fix the Big Gete
Star at my leisure afterwards!

40:44.150 --> 40:48.486
What l have is plenty in order
to defeat the likes of you!

40:48.571 --> 40:55.535
Looks like there ain 't anything for me to do but
make sure you can't do any more harm again!

40:58.122 --> 41:00.081
You sickening punk!

41:13.137 --> 41:16.848
lt is not possible for you to defeat me!

41:18.559 --> 41:24.731
Even if you know it's impossible, there
are times when you must do it anyway!

41:34.533 --> 41:39.287
ls there any such thing as impossible for us?

42:43.727 --> 42:45.144
G- Goku...

42:53.112 --> 42:54.696
Father...

43:10.129 --> 43:12.505
Father!

43:29.732 --> 43:33.484
Guess we had to have the Senzu
take care of us this time as well.

43:35.696 --> 43:38.448
Huh? Where's Vegeta?

43:38.532 --> 43:42.619
He took his Senzu and
disappeared somewhere by himself.

43:42.703 --> 43:47.624
Well, this time at least,
we survived thanks to Vegeta.

43:47.708 --> 43:51.419
Without his power, we couldn 't have won.

44:09.688 --> 44:11.648
" Help me! "

44:17.780 --> 44:24.202
"We've had it! " Don't embarrass us,
you're the one we're counting on!

44:24.286 --> 44:29.999
" Help me! " Just a bit longer,
you've got to show your grit!

44:30.084 --> 44:33.294
Now believe, (l don't want to cry),

44:33.379 --> 44:36.339
Now look forward, (l don't want to run),

44:36.423 --> 44:40.009
Now rise up, (l cannot lose)!

44:40.094 --> 44:43.221
That's right!

44:43.305 --> 44:49.727
Take flame, my hero, and go beyond time!

44:49.812 --> 44:56.025
You are my hero, and that is not a lie!

44:56.110 --> 44:58.986
When it comes to the future
(when it comes to the future),

44:59.071 --> 45:02.865
Take it in your grasp,
(you're the hero guy!)

45:09.081 --> 45:21.718
Ah, you can see it, can't you?
The courage within yourself?

45:21.802 --> 45:28.015
Take flame, my hero, and go beyond time!

45:28.100 --> 45:34.480
Take flame, my hero,
and go beyond the stars!

45:34.565 --> 45:39.736
You are my hero, and that is no dream!

45:39.820 --> 45:42.405
Take it in your grasp!
