00:00.266 --> 00:03.413
<i>They say bad things come in threes,</i>

00:03.440 --> 00:06.409
<i>and, sadly, I had become
living proof of that.</i>

00:06.442 --> 00:10.112
<i>Enduring a betrayal from
my best friend and boyfriend...</i>

00:10.146 --> 00:13.215
You knew they were hooking up,
and you kept it from me?

00:13.249 --> 00:15.651
Not my secret to share.

00:17.453 --> 00:20.089
<i>...a cheating scandal
with my chemistry final...</i>

00:23.125 --> 00:25.928
<i>...which led to
a financial crisis with my dad.</i>

00:25.962 --> 00:26.997
I'm cutting you off, Zoey.

00:27.029 --> 00:28.665
<i>...that hit harder
than when the Internet</i>

00:28.698 --> 00:30.801
<i>made Blockbuster its bitch.</i>

00:30.833 --> 00:34.003
<i>Thankfully, I had resolved
my first two issues.</i>

00:36.772 --> 00:39.075
<i>And even though my dad
had cut off my credit cards...</i>

00:39.109 --> 00:40.077
Declined?

00:40.110 --> 00:41.577
<i>...I wasn't worried.</i>

00:41.610 --> 00:44.146
It's only a matter of time
before my dad rolls over

00:44.180 --> 00:46.015
and basically begs for my forgiveness.

00:46.049 --> 00:47.985
In fact, I bet
that there is a guilt gift

00:48.018 --> 00:49.786
waiting on my doorstep.

00:49.818 --> 00:51.487
Eh?

00:53.289 --> 00:55.859
What is he doing to my baby?!

00:57.226 --> 01:00.930
Hi, sir. Hi. Nice to meet you.

01:00.963 --> 01:03.599
Um, I-I-I know that
this is faculty parking,

01:03.633 --> 01:05.634
but everyone knows that Professor Diaz

01:05.668 --> 01:07.270
never uses this spot
since she's in rehab

01:07.303 --> 01:08.605
for scratcher tickets.

01:08.637 --> 01:10.473
Look, the owner of the car
requested the tow.

01:10.506 --> 01:11.541
Mm, fun fact...

01:11.574 --> 01:13.176
I am actually the owner of the car.

01:13.208 --> 01:16.178
Well, then, I'm just doing
what you told me to...

01:16.211 --> 01:19.148
- Oh?
- ...Andre Johnson.

01:21.717 --> 01:24.687
Dad?!

01:24.720 --> 01:26.055
You know what?

01:26.088 --> 01:28.691
I bet he is taking this car away

01:28.725 --> 01:32.329
to replace it with
a more expensive, newer one.

01:32.362 --> 01:35.032
That's how a good guilt gift
works, right?

01:35.065 --> 01:36.800
Right?

01:36.833 --> 01:38.402
No!

01:38.434 --> 01:41.070
Oh, God! Remember me!

02:18.273 --> 02:20.943
Repo'ing my car?

02:20.976 --> 02:23.847
Low blow, Andre Johnson. Low. Blow.

02:23.879 --> 02:25.549
I mean, I knew
this man had a petty bone,

02:25.581 --> 02:26.949
but this is another level.

02:26.982 --> 02:30.087
Like "Blac Chyna having
a whole-ass revenge baby"

02:30.119 --> 02:31.688
type level.

02:31.720 --> 02:33.289
But it's okay because your girl

02:33.323 --> 02:35.425
has some other tricks up her sleeve.

02:35.457 --> 02:36.693
Okay.

02:38.000 --> 02:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:49.973 --> 02:53.910
All right. Well, then, time for Plan B.

03:05.154 --> 03:08.091
I feel so unloved.

03:08.123 --> 03:09.793
Is this how my other siblings feel?

03:11.660 --> 03:13.062
Cut off? So, what does this mean?

03:13.095 --> 03:14.396
Do you have to, like,
drop out of school?

03:14.430 --> 03:16.933
No. My mom said they'll
still cover tuition,

03:16.966 --> 03:17.968
housing, books,

03:18.000 --> 03:19.169
but everything else...

03:19.201 --> 03:20.903
my clothing, my groceries,

03:20.937 --> 03:22.439
my Japanese soda subscription box...

03:22.472 --> 03:23.807
- I'm completely on my own.
- Mm.

03:23.839 --> 03:24.841
Girl, please.

03:24.873 --> 03:26.342
You're over here whining
when your parents

03:26.375 --> 03:27.843
are still covering your basic needs?

03:27.877 --> 03:30.147
Yeah, we literally have
to run for our lives

03:30.180 --> 03:31.515
to support ourselves.

03:31.547 --> 03:33.817
We're in a four-year version
of "The Hunger Games."

03:33.849 --> 03:35.017
But what should I do?

03:35.051 --> 03:36.920
Get. A. Job. Bitch.

03:36.952 --> 03:38.521
Um, okay. I already have one.

03:38.555 --> 03:42.192
Does no one here remember the
Zoey Johnson Styling Experience?

03:42.224 --> 03:44.493
Get. A. Real. Job. Bitch.

03:44.527 --> 03:46.529
Who said you could clap with us?

03:46.563 --> 03:47.831
I just kind of went for it.

03:47.863 --> 03:49.866
It's fun.

03:53.302 --> 03:55.337
Look, there's a million
different things you could do.

03:55.371 --> 03:56.338
Like this one.

03:56.372 --> 03:58.175
You could be a tutor.

03:58.207 --> 04:00.643
"Sophomore seeking help with chemistry."

04:00.676 --> 04:02.645
Oh, you put this one up.

04:02.678 --> 04:05.782
I'm just gonna put ya
back where I found ya.

04:05.814 --> 04:08.617
Hang in there, little buddy. Okay.

04:08.651 --> 04:10.187
What about dog walking?

04:10.219 --> 04:12.188
I can't walk dogs in Givenchy.

04:12.222 --> 04:14.157
Then change your shoes
and fix your life.

04:14.190 --> 04:15.291
Yeah, Zoey,

04:15.325 --> 04:17.159
stop acting like you're
too good for all of this.

04:17.192 --> 04:18.728
Everybody has a hustle.

04:18.760 --> 04:20.630
Doug works at the bookstore,

04:20.661 --> 04:22.299
Aaron's got his whole R.A. thing...

04:22.332 --> 04:24.534
I mean, even Vivek
works in the Cal U branch

04:24.566 --> 04:27.037
of the Sinaloa Cartel,
but don't tell anyone.

04:27.070 --> 04:28.572
Uh, right, allow me
to reintroduce myself.

04:28.604 --> 04:29.972
I'm Zoey Johnson.

04:30.005 --> 04:31.741
I interned for <i> Teen Vogue.</i>

04:31.774 --> 04:34.244
We had an espresso machine.

04:34.277 --> 04:37.247
Every day I'd get
a double-small, bone-dry cap

04:37.279 --> 04:39.481
with extra foam and extra hot.

04:39.514 --> 04:40.668
Which was served to me...

04:40.700 --> 04:42.192
- ...by another intern.
- Mm-hmm.

04:42.217 --> 04:46.188
Any of this would be taking
a step backwards.

04:46.222 --> 04:47.823
I can't even look at her right now.

04:47.856 --> 04:49.491
Can you please just guide my hand

04:49.525 --> 04:50.693
to her face?

04:50.726 --> 04:53.096
Okay, all I'm asking for
is a job that vibes

04:53.128 --> 04:54.664
with all of this. Look.

04:54.697 --> 04:55.732
How about what vibes

04:55.765 --> 04:58.767
with all of <i> this?</i>

04:58.801 --> 05:02.038
It's gonna take a whole lot
more than twenty grand

05:02.070 --> 05:03.339
to loot this temple.

05:03.373 --> 05:04.508
Um, for twenty grand,

05:04.541 --> 05:07.010
I'd go up there right now and
get those eggs my damn self.

05:08.611 --> 05:11.281
You know that thing
is made mostly of butter.

05:11.313 --> 05:13.249
I'd ballpark six hundo cals.

05:13.282 --> 05:15.384
What did I tell you
about counting my calories?

05:15.417 --> 05:16.418
I just care about you, man.

05:16.452 --> 05:19.055
- Stop.
- Oh. Brava!

05:19.087 --> 05:20.522
Brava! Brava!

05:20.556 --> 05:22.558
- Dicks. Absolute dicks. The both of you.
- Hit me up, right? Come on.

05:22.592 --> 05:24.426
- No, I will not. Thank you.
- You know what?

05:24.460 --> 05:26.930
Yes, we had sex.

05:26.962 --> 05:28.097
That's nice.

05:28.130 --> 05:29.398
How's your little brunch going?

05:29.431 --> 05:30.400
It's good.

05:30.433 --> 05:31.401
I wish he'd eat better.

05:31.433 --> 05:32.701
Could you get off my meal plan?

05:32.734 --> 05:34.104
You'll have to excuse them, Ana.

05:34.137 --> 05:35.939
They're, uh, incredibly stupid,

05:35.972 --> 05:38.541
and also going through
very long, dusty, dry spells.

05:38.573 --> 05:39.541
Isn't that right, boys?

05:39.575 --> 05:42.545
Anti-facts. I. Am. Good.

05:42.577 --> 05:44.647
Facts. I. Am. Horny.

05:44.681 --> 05:46.383
Ew.

05:46.416 --> 05:48.285
I'm all right to admit
I'm in a dry spell.

05:48.318 --> 05:50.152
But I will end it, and when I do,

05:50.186 --> 05:51.721
I'm gonna strut right over there

05:51.753 --> 05:53.657
- and do the "Shield Challenge."
- The what?

05:53.690 --> 05:55.791
Your lover doesn't know
about the "Shield Challenge"?

05:55.825 --> 05:56.825
Well, she does now.

05:56.859 --> 05:58.962
Bro, communication is key, guys.

05:58.995 --> 06:01.331
I mean, you know,
if you're gonna make it.

06:01.363 --> 06:02.464
What the idiots are talking about

06:02.498 --> 06:04.301
is that it's
a time-honored Cal U tradition

06:04.334 --> 06:06.136
for, you know, two people,
if they have feelings,

06:06.169 --> 06:07.671
uh, to beautifully consummate...

06:07.703 --> 06:09.305
Until you tear it up
under the Titan Shield,

06:09.339 --> 06:10.674
you're not considered a real Titan.

06:10.707 --> 06:12.409
- Essentially, yeah.
- Wait. What?

06:12.441 --> 06:14.977
I-I think it's juvenile and stupid.

06:15.010 --> 06:19.248
Right. So stupid that you took
our boy Marcus to Benihana

06:19.282 --> 06:20.450
once he smashed under the Shield.

06:20.483 --> 06:22.519
Coffee. We need coffee.

06:22.551 --> 06:23.419
You want coffee? Let's...

06:23.452 --> 06:25.354
Wait. Are you a "real Titan"?

06:25.387 --> 06:27.524
Uh... not yet.

06:28.457 --> 06:29.926
Yo, you hear that?

06:29.959 --> 06:32.662
We're goin' to Benihana, my G!

06:32.695 --> 06:33.697
- Unh!
- Yeah!

06:36.332 --> 06:38.534
<i>Even though my dad had cut me off</i>

06:38.568 --> 06:41.705
<i>and Jazz was trying to
"Handmaid's Tale" my fertility,</i>

06:41.738 --> 06:43.540
<i>I still landed on my feet...</i>

06:43.573 --> 06:46.943
<i>or should I say my YSL heels?</i>

06:49.010 --> 06:52.282
So, Luca used some of his
connections to call in a favor

06:52.315 --> 06:54.050
and got me a job at a high-end boutique,

06:54.082 --> 06:56.452
which means your girl
gets to work with clothes,

06:56.486 --> 06:59.456
clothes get to work with me,
and not to jump the gun, but...

06:59.488 --> 07:01.291
...career starter!

07:07.679 --> 07:09.140
<i>Maybe not her eyes,
but she totally did...</i>

07:09.165 --> 07:10.241
<i>...something to her...</i>

07:10.266 --> 07:11.968
You white girls
do not know how to snack.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.537
Like, do you come out the womb
eating pumpkin-flavored crap?

07:14.570 --> 07:16.306
You know, you don't need
to eat my snacks

07:16.339 --> 07:18.208
that I bought with <i> my</i> money.

07:18.241 --> 07:20.008
They just taste better
when other people buy them.

07:20.041 --> 07:21.477
Mm-hmm.

07:21.510 --> 07:23.679
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.

07:23.712 --> 07:25.248
That's what you wore on your first day?

07:25.280 --> 07:26.582
You must've killed it.

07:26.616 --> 07:28.418
And those feet.

07:28.450 --> 07:31.854
Well, you know,
I wish my boss appreciated

07:31.887 --> 07:34.056
all the effort I put in
as much as you guys.

07:34.089 --> 07:36.226
Unfortunately,
she couldn't see past her envy

07:36.258 --> 07:39.094
and told me to go home... forever.

07:39.128 --> 07:40.597
What?

07:40.630 --> 07:43.433
Yeah, I got fired.

07:43.465 --> 07:45.033
Oh.

07:48.944 --> 07:50.187
You got fired?!

07:50.212 --> 07:52.296
Zoey, you were there for,
like, four hours.

07:52.321 --> 07:54.443
I've heard worse.
Our cousin Speedy got fired

07:54.476 --> 07:56.279
after forty-five minutes at Pep Boys.

07:56.311 --> 07:58.514
Mm-hmm. Got caught
in the bathroom huffin' Bondo

07:58.548 --> 08:00.850
and drinking windshield-wiper fluid.

08:00.883 --> 08:03.419
I can't with Cousin Speedy right now.

08:03.452 --> 08:05.087
- R.I.P.
- All right, guys.

08:05.121 --> 08:06.589
As much as I appreciate the deep dive

08:06.621 --> 08:08.390
on your family's work/death history,

08:08.424 --> 08:09.793
I think we need to let Zoey speak.

08:09.825 --> 08:11.693
- Okay. Mm-hmm.
- The floor of shame is yours.

08:11.726 --> 08:14.863
Well, there's not much to tell...

08:14.897 --> 08:18.301
other than I got fired for...

08:18.334 --> 08:19.836
not folding.

08:22.839 --> 08:25.608
Oh.

08:25.640 --> 08:27.611
Zoey, what are you doing?

08:29.645 --> 08:31.614
Look, I styled the mannequin!

08:31.646 --> 08:32.881
Why?

08:32.914 --> 08:34.217
I hired you to fold.

08:34.250 --> 08:35.618
Already did it.

08:35.650 --> 08:37.453
Great. Fold them again.

08:37.486 --> 08:40.457
Uh, but it's already folded,

08:40.490 --> 08:42.458
and this mannequin was sitting here,

08:42.491 --> 08:44.327
screaming for my help.

08:44.360 --> 08:46.563
I styled that mannequin.

08:46.596 --> 08:48.431
Mm.

08:48.463 --> 08:50.632
Well, the funny story

08:50.665 --> 08:52.267
about this very mannequin

08:52.300 --> 08:56.438
is that it was sitting here,
screaming, "Hey! Help me.

08:56.472 --> 08:59.608
I've been styled too good!"

08:59.641 --> 09:02.678
So... A-plus on that.

09:02.712 --> 09:05.615
Listen, I hired you to fold. So fold.

09:05.648 --> 09:08.284
And when you're done,
shake out the folded T-shirts

09:08.317 --> 09:09.519
and fold them again.

09:09.552 --> 09:11.154
Am I being clear?

09:11.187 --> 09:12.755
Very.

09:20.630 --> 09:22.631
Oh.

09:22.664 --> 09:25.367
Wow. Even Cousin Speedy
respected authority.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.169
The shirts are already folded!

09:27.202 --> 09:30.640
And I just don't see the point
of folding and unfolding.

09:30.673 --> 09:32.008
I want to advise and style

09:32.040 --> 09:35.010
and earn commission
and just be fabulous!

09:35.044 --> 09:37.547
Yeah, but, Zoey, it sounds
like you were hired to fold...

09:37.579 --> 09:39.648
...and then shut up,
and then fold some more.

09:40.750 --> 09:42.118
You know what? It's all for the best

09:42.150 --> 09:45.121
because I learned that I am
better at boutique shopping

09:45.154 --> 09:46.556
than boutique working.

09:46.588 --> 09:49.325
And it's fine because I will
find something even more dope.

09:51.560 --> 09:54.630
Zoey, honey, listen to me.

09:54.664 --> 09:56.698
Egg harvesting is hella dope.

09:56.731 --> 10:00.135
Why are you so obsessed
with selling my eggs?

10:00.169 --> 10:03.472
Why are you so obsessed
with <i> keeping</i> your eggs?

10:07.876 --> 10:09.746
Aww.

10:09.779 --> 10:11.380
Look at all the Shield lovers

10:11.414 --> 10:12.848
who have carved their initials in here.

10:12.881 --> 10:14.550
Ooh!

10:14.583 --> 10:15.851
What is that smell?

10:15.885 --> 10:17.319
Ugh.

10:17.352 --> 10:19.722
Look, it's just a stupid tradition.

10:19.755 --> 10:21.256
Like, if it makes you uncomfortable,

10:21.289 --> 10:23.492
- we don't have to...
- No. No, no.

10:23.525 --> 10:27.063
Torres women do not back down
from a challenge.

10:27.096 --> 10:29.599
But, I mean, if you wanna punk out...

10:29.631 --> 10:31.667
Me? Pssh. What?

10:31.701 --> 10:32.835
I would go right now, broad daylight,

10:32.867 --> 10:34.169
butt-naked, no problem.

10:34.202 --> 10:35.704
- No, please don't.
- You sure?

10:35.737 --> 10:36.939
Yeah, no, we... we have a plan.

10:36.972 --> 10:38.207
- Let's stick to it.
- Okay.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.677
Under the cover of night, so...

10:40.709 --> 10:43.679
you bring a blanket, and I will bring...

10:43.712 --> 10:45.048
the sanitizer.

10:45.081 --> 10:47.616
- Good.
- Lots of sanitizer.

10:47.650 --> 10:49.284
Yeah.

10:52.654 --> 10:54.424
Okay.

10:55.757 --> 10:57.559
Why would I do that?

10:58.928 --> 11:02.731
<i>Since high-end retail
was clearly threatened by me,</i>

11:02.765 --> 11:05.534
<i>it was time to find a gig
that really appreciated</i>

11:05.568 --> 11:07.403
<i>what Zoey Johnson had to offer.</i>

11:07.435 --> 11:09.738
<i>After scouring the Internet
and finding nothing</i>

11:09.771 --> 11:12.708
<i>but entry-level,
minimum-wage weekend jobs,</i>

11:12.741 --> 11:15.812
<i>I finally found something
that would fit my vibe.</i>

11:15.845 --> 11:18.781
So, yeah, it's not
the most conventional job,

11:18.813 --> 11:21.416
but I'm getting paid
twenty-five dollars an hour

11:21.449 --> 11:23.619
to be living, breathing art.

11:23.653 --> 11:25.788
I'm practically napping
in a five-star hotel,

11:25.821 --> 11:28.825
which, T.B.H., is something
I'd totally do for free.

11:28.857 --> 11:30.492
I'm pretty much robbing them.

11:47.809 --> 11:49.277
It's Zoey.

11:49.310 --> 11:53.348
Um, hey, I'm gonna go put our names down

11:53.381 --> 11:54.349
at the oyster bar.

11:54.382 --> 11:56.618
All right. Uh,

11:56.651 --> 11:57.686
I'm gonna go find management

11:57.720 --> 11:59.789
and make a complaint about Box Girl

11:59.822 --> 12:03.592
- because that is bullshit.
- Yeah, it is.

12:03.625 --> 12:04.961
So, is there, like...
like, a secret hatch

12:04.994 --> 12:06.863
that you just... tsh...
drop out of, or how does that...

12:06.895 --> 12:09.031
Oh, whatever.
Can we rewind for a second?

12:09.064 --> 12:11.199
Are you, like, on a date right now?

12:11.232 --> 12:13.135
With our professor?

12:13.169 --> 12:17.840
I mean, first of all, hey!

12:17.872 --> 12:20.542
And, second of all...

12:20.576 --> 12:22.010
Look, it's not just a date, okay?

12:22.044 --> 12:23.513
We're kind of seeing each other.

12:25.313 --> 12:27.482
And she's not even
our professor anymore, so...

12:27.515 --> 12:29.818
But she's still a faculty member.

12:29.851 --> 12:31.853
Okay, look, can we not talk
about this right now?

12:31.886 --> 12:32.907
'Cause Paige is gonna start

12:32.931 --> 12:33.983
- wondering where I am...
- "Paige"? Wow.

12:34.008 --> 12:36.625
Are... Are you kidding?
You're on a first-name basis?

12:36.659 --> 12:38.193
Mm-hmm. Yes, I am,

12:38.226 --> 12:39.361
because it would be really weird

12:39.395 --> 12:40.996
to call her "Professor Hewson"
on a date.

12:41.029 --> 12:42.664
And what does she call you? Right?

12:42.698 --> 12:44.400
Like... "Nomi"?

12:44.433 --> 12:46.568
God, please, please
don't be weird about this.

12:46.601 --> 12:47.703
Please don't be weird about this.

12:47.736 --> 12:49.237
But it is a little weird!

12:49.270 --> 12:50.640
- It's a little bit weird?
- Mm-hmm.

12:50.673 --> 12:51.874
Is it a little bit weirder

12:51.906 --> 12:54.376
than you being paid to sit
in a box, like human veal,

12:54.409 --> 12:55.911
dressed like an anime character?

12:55.944 --> 12:57.246
Well, okay.

12:57.279 --> 13:00.283
I guess since it's
"real talk" time, I'll say it.

13:01.750 --> 13:03.318
What you're doing feels wrong.

13:03.351 --> 13:06.856
No, actually, it... it feels very wrong.

13:06.889 --> 13:09.826
Yeah, there she is!

13:09.858 --> 13:11.026
There's Judgmental Zoey.

13:11.059 --> 13:13.762
If it doesn't fit
in your little world view

13:13.795 --> 13:16.498
of what you think is okay,
you crap all over it.

13:16.531 --> 13:19.234
Well, if I'm so wrong,
then why is this some secret?

13:19.268 --> 13:21.003
I'm not doing this right now.

13:21.035 --> 13:23.271
Why? 'Cause you're doing our professor?

13:26.976 --> 13:28.878
It's kind of funny, isn't it?

13:28.910 --> 13:30.279
Hmm?

13:30.312 --> 13:33.216
It's actually the perfect job for you:

13:33.249 --> 13:37.887
doing nothing while looking
down on everybody else.

13:51.821 --> 13:54.770
<i>Here's the weird thing
about human aquariums...</i>

13:54.803 --> 13:56.438
<i>Turns out you have a lot of time</i>

13:56.472 --> 13:58.241
<i>to think while you're inside one.</i>

13:58.274 --> 14:01.476
<i>And what I realized is that
I'd been acting pretty gross</i>

14:01.510 --> 14:04.413
<i>and stuck-up to my girls
about this whole work thing.</i>

14:04.446 --> 14:08.117
<i>And as much as I thought Nomi
was making some wrong decisions</i>

14:08.150 --> 14:09.485
<i>in her personal life,</i>

14:09.518 --> 14:11.621
<i>she was right about one thing...</i>

14:11.654 --> 14:13.923
<i>I was capable
of more than sitting in a box</i>

14:13.956 --> 14:15.124
<i>and looking pretty.</i>

14:15.156 --> 14:17.893
Dude, it's so cold.

14:17.927 --> 14:19.128
Is it?

14:19.160 --> 14:20.496
Your teeth are chattering.

14:20.529 --> 14:21.630
No, this is arousal.

14:21.664 --> 14:22.999
This is what happens when I get aroused.

14:23.031 --> 14:24.099
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

14:24.132 --> 14:26.802
Um, I'm gonna do some recon,
get the blanket down,

14:26.836 --> 14:28.004
blood flowing, mood going.

14:28.036 --> 14:28.937
All right.

14:28.971 --> 14:31.774
Hold on. Okay.

14:34.709 --> 14:36.077
How is it?

14:36.111 --> 14:38.347
Uh, it's good, you know.

14:38.380 --> 14:40.448
Um, I mean, well, it's not much better.

14:40.481 --> 14:42.485
Okay, is the blanket down?
Because I'm coming in.

14:42.518 --> 14:43.986
Ana, hold up. Please.

14:44.019 --> 14:45.354
Okay. All right. What's up?

14:45.386 --> 14:48.023
What? Is something dead in there?!

14:48.057 --> 14:49.526
Yeah, romance.

14:50.726 --> 14:52.160
What are we doing?

14:52.193 --> 14:54.963
What are you talking about?
We're becoming real Titans.

14:54.996 --> 14:55.931
Yeah, but why?

14:55.965 --> 15:00.335
- Because it's fun?
- <i>Is</i> it?

15:00.369 --> 15:04.040
Well, no. So far, it's not.

15:04.073 --> 15:06.775
I don't know.
I just don't think that we...

15:06.808 --> 15:08.544
we should or that we have to.

15:08.577 --> 15:11.313
Do you not want to do it?

15:11.347 --> 15:14.382
Or do you just not want
to do it with me?

15:14.415 --> 15:17.886
What? No. I want to do it a lot,

15:17.919 --> 15:19.020
uh, with you everywhere.

15:19.053 --> 15:20.722
It's just, this place is a little...

15:20.755 --> 15:21.823
I don't know... beneath us.

15:21.856 --> 15:24.327
Beneath you, anyway.

15:24.360 --> 15:26.962
I'm sorry, but that is the nicest thing

15:26.996 --> 15:28.898
anyone has ever said to me...

15:28.930 --> 15:31.166
about public sex.

15:31.199 --> 15:33.401
Right.

15:33.434 --> 15:35.871
So, you want to get out of here?

15:35.904 --> 15:37.973
- Yeah.
- All right.

15:38.006 --> 15:40.409
You wanna get something to eat, then?

15:40.442 --> 15:44.046
Huh? No, I thought we could still,

15:44.078 --> 15:45.481
you know, do nasty stuff.

15:45.514 --> 15:46.883
Just wanna do it in a warm bed

15:46.915 --> 15:48.550
that doesn't smell like
bad decisions, you know?

15:48.583 --> 15:50.953
Oh, then we're definitely
just going to my room, then.

15:52.888 --> 15:54.390
What does that mean?

15:58.226 --> 16:00.996
So, I tried the job board again,

16:01.029 --> 16:02.899
and, as tempting as selling my eggs is,

16:02.932 --> 16:04.600
I needed to sell something
that wouldn't lead

16:04.632 --> 16:07.669
to a possible knock on my door
in eighteen years.

16:07.702 --> 16:10.539
Hey. Got you something.

16:10.572 --> 16:12.607
Most of these are used.

16:12.640 --> 16:15.010
Oh, no, I can promise you
they've never been used.

16:15.044 --> 16:17.746
Okay.

16:17.779 --> 16:22.851
Here's, uh, $38 for your troubles.

16:22.885 --> 16:25.288
What?! No! No, this is so not cool.

16:25.321 --> 16:26.856
What can I buy with this?
A carton of milk?

16:26.889 --> 16:28.090
I need more money.

16:28.122 --> 16:29.457
We're hiring.

16:29.491 --> 16:30.592
Ew.

16:32.794 --> 16:34.863
I was trying to give you the hook-up,

16:34.896 --> 16:38.967
but I see you're on your
little bougie tip, so... yeah.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.702
I'm sorry. I...
That came off the wrong way.

16:40.736 --> 16:41.803
I didn't mean it like that.

16:41.837 --> 16:43.371
You did.

16:43.404 --> 16:46.708
Look, I'm not just here
to be stacking books.

16:46.741 --> 16:49.111
I'm studying the ins and outs
of running a business.

16:49.144 --> 16:51.547
Okay, but I'm not trying
to run a bookstore.

16:51.579 --> 16:52.981
I'm trying to run the fashion world,

16:53.015 --> 16:54.317
and... I don't know...
this just doesn't seem like

16:54.350 --> 16:55.885
the path to fashion greatness.

16:55.918 --> 16:59.422
Zoey, you're taking
a shortcut to the end game,

16:59.454 --> 17:01.790
but you're skipping your opening move.

17:01.823 --> 17:03.058
Okay, not true.

17:03.092 --> 17:04.893
I got a job at a great boutique,

17:04.926 --> 17:06.428
and, legit, all they wanted me to do

17:06.461 --> 17:08.997
was fold and refold
already-folded shirts.

17:09.031 --> 17:10.933
Great. Then you should
have folded the shit

17:10.965 --> 17:12.068
out of the T-shirts.

17:12.101 --> 17:14.569
But I saw the opportunity
to do something better.

17:14.602 --> 17:16.171
But that wasn't your job.

17:16.204 --> 17:19.574
Maybe if you would've done
your job and worked hard,

17:19.608 --> 17:20.842
they would've noticed,

17:20.876 --> 17:22.144
and you would have got an opportunity

17:22.176 --> 17:23.779
to do something doper.

17:23.811 --> 17:25.448
Building blocks to greatness...

17:25.480 --> 17:28.483
patience and work ethic, B.

17:31.820 --> 17:33.489
Do they sell those here?

17:33.522 --> 17:37.159
I got thirty-eight dollars.

17:37.191 --> 17:38.326
Mm.

17:38.360 --> 17:40.295
Yeah, beds are better.

17:40.329 --> 17:42.264
Hot take on beds: They are dope.

17:42.296 --> 17:45.034
For sure.

17:45.066 --> 17:49.371
Um, so, any regrets about last night?

17:49.405 --> 17:50.606
None.

17:50.639 --> 17:52.975
I mean, it would have been cool

17:53.007 --> 17:56.044
to etch our initials on the
Shield's wall of fame, but...

17:56.078 --> 17:57.113
- Yeah.
- ...it's okay.

17:57.146 --> 17:58.981
I'll get over it.

18:04.152 --> 18:05.520
What are you doing?

18:08.857 --> 18:10.192
There.

18:10.225 --> 18:11.694
Now we have our own wall of fame.

18:11.726 --> 18:13.896
There you go.

18:13.928 --> 18:17.132
Dude, did you just write on my lamp?

18:17.166 --> 18:20.202
Yeah. It's, uh, the lamp of fame now.

18:20.235 --> 18:21.871
"Double A."

18:23.072 --> 18:24.707
That could be our nickname.

18:24.739 --> 18:26.808
You know, like Kim-ye or Bey-Z.

18:26.842 --> 18:29.477
- Aww.
- Mm-hmm.

18:29.511 --> 18:32.181
- All good couples have one.
- Mm-hmm.

18:42.224 --> 18:46.095
<i>I realized I'd spent so long
trying to find the right job</i>

18:46.128 --> 18:48.997
<i>to fit my vibe, but what
I should have been doing</i>

18:49.031 --> 18:51.367
<i>was finding the right attitude
to fit the job.</i>

18:51.400 --> 18:52.435
- Excuse me?
- Yeah?

18:52.467 --> 18:53.701
Do you know where I can find a copy

18:53.735 --> 18:55.504
of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"?

18:55.536 --> 18:57.038
That would be in fiction.

18:57.072 --> 18:59.007
But we also have the Blu-ray up front

18:59.041 --> 19:01.677
if you're anything like me
and lukewarm on reading.

19:01.709 --> 19:02.944
Oh!

19:02.977 --> 19:05.448
We have a sale on the "Keeping
it Tight-ans" tank tops.

19:05.480 --> 19:06.681
If you were to cut the collar

19:06.715 --> 19:08.284
and, like, knot
the extra fabric in the back,

19:08.316 --> 19:09.784
it'd look so cute on you.

19:09.817 --> 19:11.853
Thanks!

19:11.887 --> 19:13.121
Yeah. Over there.

<i>It wasn't the glam job I was hoping for,</i>

19:18.659 --> 19:20.428

<i>Maybe taking an entry-level job
