00:01.091 --> 00:04.174
(gong reverberating)

00:05.880 --> 00:08.630
(dramatic music)

00:11.806 --> 00:12.824
- [Newscaster] If you happened to look up

00:12.824 --> 00:14.236
in the skies over the weekend.

00:14.236 --> 00:15.069
Many of our viewers did.

00:15.069 --> 00:17.780
- [Newscaster] Thousands of
people saw these in the sky.

00:17.780 --> 00:18.940
- [Newscaster] You were not the only one.

00:18.940 --> 00:19.773
- Another strange sighting.
- We received

00:19.773 --> 00:21.766
a number of emails
today asking about them.

00:21.766 --> 00:24.843
- [Newscaster] This is
the weird unsettling sight

00:24.843 --> 00:25.740
captured on tape.

00:25.740 --> 00:27.670
- [Newscaster] Spotted in
London, Mexico, Canada.

00:27.670 --> 00:28.681
- [Newscaster] The United States Air Force

00:28.681 --> 00:29.711
said it could not identify.

00:29.711 --> 00:30.566
- [Newscaster] People
do not know what it is.

00:30.566 --> 00:32.064
- [Newscaster] Just that they look like,

00:32.064 --> 00:32.897
very like--

00:32.897 --> 00:33.730
- [Newscaster] A benevolent entity.

00:33.730 --> 00:34.831
- [Newscaster] They are peaceful.

00:34.831 --> 00:36.243
(weapons pulsing)

00:36.243 --> 00:37.124
(explosion booming)

00:37.124 --> 00:41.029

00:41.029 --> 00:43.280

02:17.640 --> 02:20.390
(rabbit squeals)

02:35.221 --> 02:37.804
(men groaning)

02:51.240 --> 02:52.589
- Hey.

02:52.589 --> 02:55.089
(Blake gasps)

03:05.138 --> 03:06.878
(thug yells)

03:06.878 --> 03:07.820
- Rotten bitch.

03:07.820 --> 03:08.878
(she yells)

03:08.878 --> 03:10.346
(she screams)

03:10.346 --> 03:12.168
I'm gonna gut you like a deer.

03:12.168 --> 03:15.001
(blaster pulsing)

03:17.725 --> 03:20.392
(ominous music)

03:26.301 --> 03:29.468
(footsteps crunching)

03:31.653 --> 03:34.162
(creature growling)

03:34.162 --> 03:36.758
(device humming)

03:36.758 --> 03:39.508

04:00.401 --> 04:02.920

04:02.920 --> 04:05.920
(creature growling)

04:11.731 --> 04:14.231
(Blake gasps)

04:26.257 --> 04:28.757
(air hissing)

04:30.681 --> 04:33.348

04:43.836 --> 04:46.669
(blaster pulsing)

05:12.234 --> 05:15.067
(blaster pulsing)

05:38.099 --> 05:41.099
(heavily breathing)

05:43.266 --> 05:44.706
(metallic whining)

05:44.706 --> 05:47.539
(blaster pulsing)

05:55.314 --> 05:56.147
- Wake up.

05:58.118 --> 05:59.535
Wake up, wake up.

06:03.381 --> 06:04.214
Oh, god.

06:05.146 --> 06:07.563
(she groans)

06:09.029 --> 06:11.862
(metal scrapping)

06:24.277 --> 06:25.663
You've gotta get up.

06:30.036 --> 06:32.369
(she gasps)

06:33.574 --> 06:36.657
(metallic scrapping)

06:39.568 --> 06:42.651
(gong reverberating)

06:57.677 --> 07:00.510
(metal scrapping)

07:07.661 --> 07:10.328
(metal rapping)

07:21.254 --> 07:22.427
- What are you doing?

07:22.427 --> 07:23.866
- [Kay] Come on, come on.

07:23.866 --> 07:24.699
Come on!

07:26.910 --> 07:28.938
- Geez, quick, get him inside.

07:28.938 --> 07:29.771
Come on.

07:34.278 --> 07:36.305
- [Kagen] What the hell did
you bring him in here for?

07:36.305 --> 07:37.310
- [Kay] He'd have died if I hadn't.

07:37.310 --> 07:38.160
- So.

07:38.160 --> 07:39.471
What's that got to do with us?

07:39.471 --> 07:41.340
- She ran into one of those goons

07:41.340 --> 07:43.210
and he saved her or something.

07:43.210 --> 07:44.400
I don't know.

07:45.236 --> 07:47.610
- You're too soft, this
isn't the old days.

07:47.610 --> 07:50.120
We can't be bringing in strays.

07:50.120 --> 07:52.110
It's all we can do to
keep ourselves alive.

07:52.110 --> 07:53.200
- He might be useful.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.340
He could have skills.

07:54.340 --> 07:56.030
- Remember the last guy
you said that about?

07:56.030 --> 07:57.640
If we we hadn't come back
from foraging in time,

07:57.640 --> 07:58.473
think what he would have done to Penny.

07:58.473 --> 08:00.130
- I couldn't just leave him there.

08:00.130 --> 08:02.350
I'd have died if he hadn't come.

08:02.350 --> 08:03.393
I just couldn't.

08:04.440 --> 08:07.380
- Well, he doesn't look hurt too bad.

08:07.380 --> 08:09.890
Blow to the head and
something chewed his arm up.

08:09.890 --> 08:12.270
- One of the Stexies got
him and he killed it.

08:12.270 --> 08:14.660
He killed the Stexie and one of the goons.

08:14.660 --> 08:15.493
I got the other one.

08:15.493 --> 08:16.590
I put an arrow right in his back.

08:16.590 --> 08:18.963
- Huh, well, aren't you the one?

08:19.940 --> 08:21.700
I guess he can stay til he's better

08:21.700 --> 08:23.750
then he goes.

08:23.750 --> 08:27.430
In the meantime, we keep a
close eye on him, agreed?

08:27.430 --> 08:29.440
- Whatever you say Kagen.

08:29.440 --> 08:30.610
- I lost my bow.

08:30.610 --> 08:31.510
- Damn it, Kay.

08:31.510 --> 08:32.880
We're short of weapons as it is.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.130
- But I got one of these.

08:36.659 --> 08:38.250
- [Hugo] Oh, that's one of the blasters.

08:38.250 --> 08:39.210
- Fair trade for a bow.

08:39.210 --> 08:40.669
- Take it to Zayden right now.

08:40.669 --> 08:42.400
- All right, but I'm keeping it.

08:42.400 --> 08:43.280
It's mine.

08:43.280 --> 08:44.280
I'm gonna figure out how to use it

08:44.280 --> 08:45.680
'cause I was good with a bow and arrow,

08:45.680 --> 08:46.870
but with one of these things.

08:46.870 --> 08:50.533
- Be careful, you might
blow your face off.

08:51.884 --> 08:53.434
- I wish we had an army of her.

08:54.840 --> 08:56.083
- She's too soft.

08:57.180 --> 08:59.025
Now, help me get this guy bandaged up.

08:59.025 --> 09:00.161
- [Hugo] Okay.

09:00.161 --> 09:02.828
(ominous music)

09:05.338 --> 09:06.510
- [Kay] Bam, bam, bam.
(Penny screams)

09:06.510 --> 09:07.844
Sorry, sorry.

09:07.844 --> 09:09.643
- Oh, my god, you scared me to death.

09:11.310 --> 09:12.900
Is that an alien blaster?

09:12.900 --> 09:13.733
- [Kay] It is.

09:13.733 --> 09:15.320
- Where did you find this?

09:15.320 --> 09:16.230
- Off a dead alien.

09:16.230 --> 09:17.240
- [Penny] You killed him?

09:17.240 --> 09:18.720
- I sure did.

09:18.720 --> 09:21.120
- Wow, you're not the only
one that's been doing things.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.010
Look at this.

09:23.041 --> 09:24.730
- Where did you find all this?

09:24.730 --> 09:27.190
- There's a store in town that
hasn't been cleaned out yet.

09:27.190 --> 09:28.660
- You went into town on your own?

09:28.660 --> 09:29.580
- There's more, too.

09:29.580 --> 09:30.670
I hid it before I left.

09:30.670 --> 09:31.550
We can go back for it.

09:31.550 --> 09:34.090
- Penn, you can't be going
in to town on your own.

09:34.090 --> 09:35.010
They look for us there,

09:35.010 --> 09:36.350
not to mention the gangs.

09:36.350 --> 09:37.870
- We hadn't seen anyone around in months.

09:37.870 --> 09:39.960
- It's still too dangerous.

09:39.960 --> 09:40.880
- I can take care of myself.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.560
- You can (she groans) come on.

09:43.560 --> 09:45.336
I gotta go see Zayden.

09:45.336 --> 09:47.548
(equipment blipping)

09:47.548 --> 09:50.715
(electrical sizzling)

09:53.977 --> 09:56.000
- Miles, that didn't work.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.202
- Have you tried inverting

09:57.202 --> 10:00.266
the chapel streams in
the singularity path--

10:00.266 --> 10:01.099
(static crackling).

10:01.099 --> 10:01.932
- No, no, no.

10:01.932 --> 10:02.765
I'm afraid that's gonna cause

10:02.765 --> 10:04.080
a flux in the plasma converters.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.230
I don't wanna do that.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.310
- I hadn't thought of that.

10:07.310 --> 10:09.755
Let me recalculate and
I'll get back to you.

10:09.755 --> 10:10.600
(monitor screeches)

10:10.600 --> 10:12.160
- All right, thanks Miles.

10:12.160 --> 10:13.140
- [Penny] Hey, Uncle Zayden.

10:13.140 --> 10:14.000
- Are we interrupting?

10:14.000 --> 10:16.640
- No, no, no-no-no, it's
a critical sensor battery.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.180
It's being very touchy.

10:18.180 --> 10:19.330
But I'll figure it out.

10:20.820 --> 10:22.500
So what have you been up to?

10:22.500 --> 10:23.463
- Look what I have.

10:25.350 --> 10:27.713
- Huh-ho, where on earth?

10:27.713 --> 10:29.830
(he inhales)

10:29.830 --> 10:32.763
Spinach, kidney beans?

10:36.430 --> 10:38.070
Cream chipped beef?

10:38.070 --> 10:39.937
- I know you don't eat meat, but.

10:39.937 --> 10:42.830
- That's all right I never proselytize.

10:42.830 --> 10:44.930
If you girls wanna eat
your fellow creatures

10:44.930 --> 10:45.916
like primitive savages.

10:45.916 --> 10:48.000
It's all right.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.373
German potato salad.

10:51.120 --> 10:53.590
We eat like a king for a week at least.

10:53.590 --> 10:54.800
- Oh, there's more.

10:54.800 --> 10:55.633
There's lots more.

10:55.633 --> 10:56.466
I'm gonna go back for it.

10:56.466 --> 10:57.933
- Not going alone you're not.

10:58.970 --> 10:59.803
- What about you?

10:59.803 --> 11:01.480
What's new and exciting in your world?

11:02.385 --> 11:04.991
(metal vibrating)

11:04.991 --> 11:06.830
Where did you find that?

11:07.680 --> 11:09.090
- I took it off a dead goon.

11:09.090 --> 11:10.930
- You found a dead goon.

11:10.930 --> 11:11.963
- I shot him dead.

11:13.315 --> 11:14.148
- It's so hard to believe

11:14.148 --> 11:16.340
that you are the same sweet little girl

11:16.340 --> 11:17.670
who cried for a week once

11:17.670 --> 11:19.870
when her father ran over a squirrel.

11:19.870 --> 11:22.190
- That's back when I had a father.

11:22.190 --> 11:23.840
- Well, that's a whole world ago.

11:24.750 --> 11:29.750
You know if I can figure out
the principles behind this,

11:31.040 --> 11:33.160
this could make quite a difference.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.310
- When can I have it back?

11:34.310 --> 11:36.440
- Back, what for?

11:36.440 --> 11:39.080
- So I don't have to arm myself
like a 13th century peasant.

11:39.080 --> 11:44.080
- Look, the physics behind
this are entirely alien to me.

11:44.460 --> 11:46.550
I may never figure it out.

11:46.550 --> 11:48.260
So in the meantime, you're
gonna have to make do

11:48.260 --> 11:50.330
with a crossbow and a sling.

11:50.330 --> 11:52.040
- I'd settle for a decent shotgun.

11:52.040 --> 11:53.400
- That's not my department.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.876
I'm a theoretical
physicist not a gunsmith.

11:55.876 --> 11:57.296
- All right.

11:57.296 --> 11:58.796
I'll let you get back to work.

12:01.960 --> 12:03.460
- Uh-uh-uh oh, what about you?

12:06.400 --> 12:07.233
All right.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.503
- Zayden?

12:12.503 --> 12:13.670
- [Zayden] Hm?

12:14.660 --> 12:15.693
- I saw him again.

12:18.940 --> 12:20.500
- Saw who?

12:20.500 --> 12:22.190
- That stranger.

12:22.190 --> 12:23.940
The one that's been hiding from us.

12:27.160 --> 12:28.043
- What did he do?

12:29.930 --> 12:34.150
I saw him in the distance,
but he watched me for awhile

12:34.150 --> 12:35.693
and then he disappeared again.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.764
- It's not him.

12:39.764 --> 12:40.597
It can't be him.

12:40.597 --> 12:41.430
He's dead.

12:41.430 --> 12:42.670
- Nobody saw him die.

12:42.670 --> 12:45.080
- He was outside in the blast.

12:45.080 --> 12:47.170
He caught the full force of the radiation.

12:47.170 --> 12:48.771
- I know, but.

12:48.771 --> 12:51.854
(equipment blipping)

12:56.080 --> 12:56.997
Good night.

12:58.204 --> 12:59.287
- Good night.

13:23.180 --> 13:25.513
(he groans)

13:26.980 --> 13:29.730
(water dripping)

14:38.375 --> 14:41.042
(ominous music)

14:42.220 --> 14:45.472
- I knew he'd be nothing
but trouble I just knew it.

14:45.472 --> 14:48.555
(metallic scrapping)

14:50.200 --> 14:52.163
Kay, Penny, get out here.

14:53.504 --> 14:55.400
(gong reverberating)

14:55.400 --> 14:56.270
- Take it easy, lady.

14:56.270 --> 14:57.930
I don't want any trouble.

14:57.930 --> 14:59.080
- Liar, thief.

14:59.080 --> 15:00.283
- I'm not a liar.

15:01.370 --> 15:03.448
(suspenseful music)

15:03.448 --> 15:05.781
(he groans)

15:08.018 --> 15:09.305
I don't wanna hurt anybody.

15:09.305 --> 15:10.481
But I am getting the hell out of here.

15:10.481 --> 15:13.081
And none of you bitches
better try to stop me again.

15:15.276 --> 15:18.598
(creature roaring)

15:18.598 --> 15:21.598
(creature chirping)

15:26.325 --> 15:27.501
- Ha, ha.

15:27.501 --> 15:29.109
Ha.

15:29.109 --> 15:29.942
Ha.

15:29.942 --> 15:32.775
(creature growls)

15:43.053 --> 15:45.970
(creature squeals)

15:59.013 --> 16:01.680
(ominous music)

16:04.923 --> 16:07.590
(body chirping)

16:09.830 --> 16:11.080
- It's all in the wrists.

16:11.080 --> 16:14.450
You give it a little twist and
pop the head comes right off.

16:14.450 --> 16:17.600
We better go hide the body,
before they come looking for it.

16:17.600 --> 16:18.640
- The goons?

16:18.640 --> 16:19.790
Why would they do that?

16:20.830 --> 16:21.663
- Trust me.

16:21.663 --> 16:24.121
- You seem to know a lot about them.

16:24.121 --> 16:25.113
- I've been around.

16:26.228 --> 16:27.488
- I'd like to talk you.

16:27.488 --> 16:29.068
Very unusual that we meet anybody

16:29.068 --> 16:31.807
who isn't trying to rob us or kill us.

16:31.807 --> 16:33.600
- How do we know he's not?

16:33.600 --> 16:35.730
- This is the second
time I've saved her life.

16:35.730 --> 16:38.227
- Hey, I shot that goon that
was gonna kill you back there

16:38.227 --> 16:39.327
and I dragged your ass back here.

16:39.327 --> 16:41.190
I could have left you for dead.

16:41.190 --> 16:42.023
We're even.

16:42.023 --> 16:43.700
- We're about to eat something.

16:43.700 --> 16:45.083
Why don't you join us?

16:46.980 --> 16:49.480
- All right, I never turn down food.

16:49.480 --> 16:51.020
- Smart man.

16:51.020 --> 16:53.130
- Looks like you eat
pretty good around here.

16:53.130 --> 16:54.320
- Not always this good.

16:54.320 --> 16:55.730
- I found a new stash of food.

16:55.730 --> 16:57.110
- Oh, yeah?

16:57.110 --> 16:57.943
Where?

16:59.160 --> 17:01.560
Hm, I don't blame ya, I
wouldn't tell me either.

17:03.470 --> 17:04.460
- You got a name?

17:04.460 --> 17:05.292
- Blake.

17:06.203 --> 17:10.500
- Oh, this is Kagen and
Kay and Hugo and Penny

17:10.500 --> 17:11.633
and I'm Zayden.

17:12.690 --> 17:15.599
- Zayden, you look familiar.

17:15.599 --> 17:17.440
Like I've seen your face somewhere.

17:17.440 --> 17:20.030
- Uncle Zayden was a famous scientist.

17:20.030 --> 17:21.030
- Zayden Heisenberg?

17:23.119 --> 17:25.079
Nobel prize, physics.

17:25.079 --> 17:26.670
- That was a long time ago.

17:26.670 --> 17:29.993
- Huh, you never know who
you'll run into these days.

17:31.280 --> 17:33.750
- What did you do before
the invasion, Mr. Blake?

17:33.750 --> 17:35.000
- Just Blake.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.210
I was a crook.

17:36.210 --> 17:37.670
- What kind of crook?

17:37.670 --> 17:39.140
- I wasn't fussy.

17:39.140 --> 17:42.150
I preferred mostly small
stuff, watches, jewelry.

17:42.150 --> 17:44.280
But I'd take whatever came along.

17:44.280 --> 17:46.420
- You don't seem very
embarrassed about it.

17:46.420 --> 17:47.480
- I never carried a gun.

17:47.480 --> 17:50.370
I never hurt anybody and
I hardly ever got caught.

17:50.370 --> 17:52.600
Besides, I figure we're all
in the same boat anyway.

17:52.600 --> 17:53.960
We all grab what we can get.

17:53.960 --> 17:55.290
I was just ahead of the game.

17:55.290 --> 17:57.113
- I have to agree with him on that.

17:58.470 --> 18:00.570
Now, what were you saying

18:00.570 --> 18:02.700
about the aliens were gonna come back

18:02.700 --> 18:04.650
looking for the Clicket?

18:04.650 --> 18:05.780
- Clicket?

18:05.780 --> 18:07.140
Oh, the big bug.

18:07.140 --> 18:08.880
Yeah, they keep an eye on them.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.600
If they find one dead they get suspicious

18:10.600 --> 18:11.930
and start nosing around.

18:11.930 --> 18:13.640
That's one of the reasons
they put them there.

18:13.640 --> 18:14.780
- Put them here?

18:14.780 --> 18:16.020
- [Blake] Um-hm.

18:16.020 --> 18:18.280
- But I always assumed that the clickets

18:18.280 --> 18:20.540
were some sort of random mutation

18:20.540 --> 18:22.660
because of the radiation bombardment.

18:22.660 --> 18:24.210
Do you mean to say that the aliens

18:24.210 --> 18:26.720
deliberately placed them here?

18:26.720 --> 18:27.820
- [Blake] Sure.

18:27.820 --> 18:28.653
- What for?

18:30.570 --> 18:32.960
- You know those little snails
they used to put in aquariums

18:32.960 --> 18:34.760
to clean up all the leftover debris,

18:35.700 --> 18:38.400
well the clickets are the
snails and we're the debris.

18:40.090 --> 18:42.520
- After we finish eating, Mr. Blake.

18:42.520 --> 18:44.230
- [Blake] Just Blake.

18:44.230 --> 18:47.403
- Perhaps you'd like to take
a look at my laboratory?

18:48.570 --> 18:49.710
- Laboratory?

18:49.710 --> 18:50.833
Sure, why not.

18:53.140 --> 18:54.750
Quite a display you've got here.

18:54.750 --> 18:58.480
- Oh, I know it all looks
like a pile of junk.

18:58.480 --> 19:01.250
I've had to scrounge it
wherever I could find.

19:01.250 --> 19:03.853
However, I have had some
pretty impressive results.

19:05.280 --> 19:06.230
- What's the point?

19:07.960 --> 19:11.550
- I'm trying to learn as much
as I can about our conquerors.

19:11.550 --> 19:13.750
I've been working with a
number of other scientists

19:13.750 --> 19:16.903
by means of a primitive
sort of radio hookup.

19:19.830 --> 19:21.660
- Aren't you worried about eavesdroppers?

19:21.660 --> 19:23.933
- Well at first, yes, but not anymore.

19:24.827 --> 19:26.320
I don't think they have radio.

19:26.320 --> 19:27.640
- Are you kidding me?

19:27.640 --> 19:30.380
They destroyed our entire
civilization in less than a week.

19:30.380 --> 19:32.840
We're talking about pretty
advanced technology here.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.610
- A totally alien technology.

19:34.610 --> 19:37.350
I don't even think they have
the same senses as we do.

19:37.350 --> 19:40.820
They might see in infrared or hear color.

19:40.820 --> 19:42.225
I don't know.

19:42.225 --> 19:44.770
- Huh, so, where do
you think they're from?

19:44.770 --> 19:46.404
Some other galaxy or?

19:46.404 --> 19:48.190
- Oh, I don't think so.

19:48.190 --> 19:53.133
I suspect another dimension maybe.

19:54.490 --> 19:55.850
I don't know.

19:55.850 --> 19:59.360
I mean it would help if I had
a live specimen to examine,

19:59.360 --> 20:03.246
but so far all I have
to work with is this.

20:03.246 --> 20:04.637
(gong reverberating)

20:04.637 --> 20:05.470
(Blake gasps)

20:05.470 --> 20:06.303
- Holy crap.

20:08.670 --> 20:09.720
Where did you get it?

20:10.620 --> 20:13.650
- Oh, Kay brought it back from
one of her little excursions.

20:13.650 --> 20:15.620
- Aren't you full of surprises?

20:15.620 --> 20:17.930
- Now, you'll notice it has no ears.

20:17.930 --> 20:20.260
It has no auditory organs at all

20:20.260 --> 20:21.170
that I've been able to find.

20:21.170 --> 20:23.470
I don't even think they
communicate by sound.

20:23.470 --> 20:25.160
And the eyes are interesting as well.

20:25.160 --> 20:28.593
But I don't think they see
in the same spectrum as ours.

20:29.770 --> 20:32.370
It would help if I had
better junk to work with.

20:32.370 --> 20:34.670
But I did manage to rig this up.

20:34.670 --> 20:36.240
- Where do you get your power?

20:36.240 --> 20:40.422
- Batteries charged by generator
used sparingly, of course.

20:40.422 --> 20:43.650
The sound brings unwanted attention.

20:43.650 --> 20:45.360
- I thought you said they were deaf?

20:45.360 --> 20:46.740
- People aren't.

20:46.740 --> 20:49.070
We've had some unwelcome company.

20:49.070 --> 20:51.800
Present company excluded, maybe.

20:51.800 --> 20:52.750
- And look at this.

20:53.947 --> 20:56.780
(machine humming)

21:02.448 --> 21:05.365
(static crackling)

21:07.500 --> 21:08.333
- What a mess.

21:08.333 --> 21:12.380
No heart, no lungs, no nothing.

21:12.380 --> 21:14.030
- Yes, it's interesting isn't it?

21:15.601 --> 21:18.380
- I saw her kill him with an arrow.

21:18.380 --> 21:21.530
How could she do that if
there's no vital organs?

21:21.530 --> 21:22.780
- I don't know.

21:28.367 --> 21:30.460
- You can sleep here tonight.

21:30.460 --> 21:32.190
- [Blake] No handcuffs?

21:32.190 --> 21:33.200
- [Kay] You're off probation.

21:33.200 --> 21:36.073
- Hm, so what, you guys family or?

21:37.190 --> 21:38.040
- We are now.

21:38.040 --> 21:39.923
- You call Heisenberg, Uncle Zayden.

21:42.200 --> 21:44.930
- Penny and I are the
only blood relations.

21:44.930 --> 21:47.610
We had a brother, Alex, but.

21:47.610 --> 21:49.170
- Dead?

21:49.170 --> 21:50.003
- Nobody knows.

21:50.970 --> 21:52.800
He disappeared during
the second bombardment.

21:52.800 --> 21:54.663
- Hm, then he's as good as dead.

21:56.994 --> 21:58.090
- You know I was hoping you were not

21:58.090 --> 22:00.890
as big an asshole as I thought you were.

22:00.890 --> 22:02.610
The more of us that band together,

22:02.610 --> 22:05.050
the better chance we
have against the goons.

22:05.050 --> 22:07.993
- Hm, so that'd make me your big brother?

22:11.140 --> 22:12.640
- I'll see you in the morning.

22:14.340 --> 22:16.273
- What are your feelings on incest?

22:17.660 --> 22:19.610
- You do not want to mess with me.

22:19.610 --> 22:21.893
- Oh, you got me so scared.

22:26.225 --> 22:29.240
(he yells)

22:29.240 --> 22:30.490
Ow, uncle!

22:30.490 --> 22:32.151
All right, you win.

22:32.151 --> 22:34.664
(he groans)

22:34.664 --> 22:36.168
(Kay yells)

22:36.168 --> 22:38.013
- You didn't think you had me did you?

22:43.770 --> 22:44.980
What?

22:44.980 --> 22:46.180
- Go ahead.

22:46.180 --> 22:47.400
- [Blake] What do you mean?

22:47.400 --> 22:49.600
- Go ahead and do
whatever you're gonna do.

22:49.600 --> 22:53.000
But afterwards no matter
what, I will kill you.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.340
- What's wrong with you?

22:54.340 --> 22:55.720
- What's wrong with me?

22:55.720 --> 22:57.160
You attacked me.

22:57.160 --> 22:58.000
- Like hell I did.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.510
I was standing by the door
and you twisted my arm off.

23:00.510 --> 23:02.130
- I was defending myself.

23:02.130 --> 23:03.430
- Not from me you weren't.

23:03.430 --> 23:05.170
I've never tried anything
like that in my life

23:05.170 --> 23:06.810
and sure wouldn't start with you.

23:06.810 --> 23:08.270
- What the hell is that supposed to mean?

23:08.270 --> 23:10.400
- Hey, you've heard the expression
I wouldn't sleep with you

23:10.400 --> 23:12.490
if you were the last woman on earth?

23:12.490 --> 23:15.489
Well, here we are and I'm
still not that desperate.

23:15.489 --> 23:17.074
- You son of a bitch.

23:17.074 --> 23:18.741
- [Blake] Thank you.

23:19.876 --> 23:20.709
(metal clanging)

23:20.709 --> 23:22.549
(Kay gasps)

23:22.549 --> 23:23.506
- Are you all right?

23:23.506 --> 23:25.010
What the hell did you
hit him in the head for?

23:25.010 --> 23:26.380
He already has a concussion?

23:26.380 --> 23:27.823
- What the hell's going on?

23:27.823 --> 23:29.820
- Nothing we were just.

23:29.820 --> 23:32.270
Nothing, I, are you all right?

23:32.270 --> 23:33.103
- I'm gonna sleep outside.

23:33.103 --> 23:34.363
It's too dangerous in here.

23:35.304 --> 23:36.926
- What was he doing to you?

23:36.926 --> 23:37.820
- [Kay] Nothing.

23:37.820 --> 23:41.314
- Just getting acquainted, you know.

23:41.314 --> 23:42.147
(Blake groans)

23:42.147 --> 23:43.290
- You go to bed, go on.

23:43.290 --> 23:44.780
- You know I'm not a child.

23:44.780 --> 23:46.080
- That's what worries me.

23:46.080 --> 23:47.720
Get moving.

23:47.720 --> 23:48.830
- Are you sure you're all right?

23:48.830 --> 23:51.016
- [Blake] Yes, go away.

23:51.016 --> 23:53.516
(she exhales)

23:57.281 --> 23:59.690
(Blake moans)

23:59.690 --> 24:00.780
- [Kay] What are you doing?

24:00.780 --> 24:01.950
- I'm locking him in.

24:01.950 --> 24:03.996
- It won't do any good.

24:03.996 --> 24:05.502
- Then I'll lock you in, too.

24:05.502 --> 24:06.335
- [Kay] Ha.

24:06.335 --> 24:07.168
(Kay laughs)

24:07.168 --> 24:09.516
(lips smacking)

24:09.516 --> 24:12.349
(ominous humming)

24:14.791 --> 24:17.458
(ominous music)

24:36.238 --> 24:39.321
(equipment blipping)

24:57.292 --> 25:00.292
(suspenseful music)

25:47.983 --> 25:50.650
(bolt crashing)

26:06.722 --> 26:09.472
(wind whistling)

27:01.344 --> 27:04.344
(footsteps echoing)

27:44.203 --> 27:46.870
(Penny screams)

27:52.786 --> 27:55.513
(metallic scrapping)

27:55.513 --> 27:56.346
(electrical hissing)

27:56.346 --> 27:57.465
- No-no, please, please don't.

27:57.465 --> 27:58.298
(electrical hissing)

27:58.298 --> 27:59.607
(Penny moans)

27:59.607 --> 28:02.690
(gong reverberating)

28:14.830 --> 28:17.497
(air swooshing)

28:19.863 --> 28:24.863
- Penny?

28:27.180 --> 28:28.013
Penny?

28:30.711 --> 28:33.044
(she sighs)

28:34.190 --> 28:36.720
Hey, wake up.

28:36.720 --> 28:37.870
Wake up.

28:37.870 --> 28:41.800
Penny is gone and I cannot
find that son of a bitch Blake.

28:41.800 --> 28:42.780
- What?

28:42.780 --> 28:44.082
- We gotta go.

28:44.082 --> 28:45.345
- I'll kill him.

28:45.345 --> 28:48.710
(crickets chirping)

28:48.710 --> 28:49.543
- We should split up.

28:49.543 --> 28:50.627
- Wouldn't it be safer
if we stayed together.

28:50.627 --> 28:52.820
- Sure, but we can cover
more ground if we split up.

28:52.820 --> 28:53.750
Look we have no idea

28:53.750 --> 28:54.870
what could be happening to her right now.

28:54.870 --> 28:57.010
We have no time to lose, agreed?

28:57.010 --> 28:58.540
- Agreed.

28:58.540 --> 28:59.373
Agreed?

28:59.373 --> 29:00.206
- Agreed.

29:02.771 --> 29:05.271
(jazzy music)

29:12.170 --> 29:13.310
- This music sucks.

29:13.310 --> 29:14.689
(radio crashing)

29:14.689 --> 29:17.740
- Then find something else.

29:17.740 --> 29:19.500
- [Woman] How many?

29:19.500 --> 29:20.557
- [Thug] I'm good.

29:20.557 --> 29:21.474
- Ah, crap.

29:24.513 --> 29:26.257
Dealer takes three.

29:26.257 --> 29:28.757
(jazzy music)

29:30.033 --> 29:32.700
- You're overthinking this, pal.

29:35.537 --> 29:36.370
- Call.

29:38.089 --> 29:39.064
- Full house.

29:39.064 --> 29:40.557
Queens high.

29:40.557 --> 29:41.974
- Son of a bitch.

29:43.580 --> 29:44.860
Okay, cutie.

29:44.860 --> 29:46.082
Off with your shirt.

29:46.082 --> 29:47.107
- No.

29:47.107 --> 29:47.940
- Zack.

29:50.117 --> 29:53.061
(electric crackling)
(Penny yells)

29:53.061 --> 29:54.644
- Okay, okay, okay.

30:08.517 --> 30:09.525
- Where's Penny?

30:09.525 --> 30:10.692
Where's Penny?

30:13.146 --> 30:14.677
(Kay gasps)

30:14.677 --> 30:16.755
- Will you be quiet?

30:16.755 --> 30:17.588
They got her in there.

30:17.588 --> 30:19.550
Now if I take my hand away
are you gonna be quiet?

30:24.540 --> 30:25.520
- What did you do to her?

30:25.520 --> 30:27.630
- I haven't been within
50 feet of her all night.

30:27.630 --> 30:29.800
I saw her sneaking
away, so I followed her.

30:29.800 --> 30:31.640
She ran into those guys
and they snatched her.

30:31.640 --> 30:32.583
- Why didn't you stop them?

30:32.583 --> 30:35.130
- Because there were three
of them and one of me.

30:35.130 --> 30:36.880
They had weapons, I had nothing.

30:36.880 --> 30:38.030
You see how that works?

30:39.460 --> 30:40.627
- What have they done?

30:40.627 --> 30:41.460
Did they?

30:41.460 --> 30:43.263
- No, not as far as I can tell.

30:44.125 --> 30:46.176
They're having a little
fun with her first.

30:46.176 --> 30:47.248
(electric crackling)
(Penny screaming)

30:47.248 --> 30:48.081
(Kay gasps)

30:48.081 --> 30:49.150
Hold on.

30:49.150 --> 30:51.957
We need a plan or at
least a weapon anyway.

30:51.957 --> 30:54.480
- He has got a weapon.

30:54.480 --> 30:55.987
- Yeah, all right.

30:55.987 --> 30:57.893
Give me two minutes and then distract him.

30:57.893 --> 30:59.653
Without getting yourself killed.

31:05.519 --> 31:07.290
- [Thug] This is it.

31:07.290 --> 31:10.854
Whoever wins this hand once
she's butt naked, gets her.

31:10.854 --> 31:13.364
(all laugh)

31:13.364 --> 31:15.240
- Hey, what about me?

31:15.240 --> 31:19.000
- Relax, Who ever wins
this hand gets her first.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.434
We'll all get a shot.

31:20.434 --> 31:22.374
(all laugh)

31:22.374 --> 31:24.874
(jazzy music)

31:35.066 --> 31:38.120
(steps echoing)

31:38.120 --> 31:39.350
- Hey, guys.

31:39.350 --> 31:40.220
- Shut up.

31:40.220 --> 31:41.803
This is a big hand.

31:42.680 --> 31:45.184
- Uh, but guys, guys.

31:45.184 --> 31:46.017
- Shut up.

31:50.999 --> 31:53.749
(fire crackling)

31:59.533 --> 32:02.033
(thug groans)

32:15.291 --> 32:17.805
(electrical crackling)
(Penny yelling)

32:17.805 --> 32:20.305
(Zack groans)

32:27.280 --> 32:28.363
- Get, Penny.

32:36.876 --> 32:38.016
(electric crackling)
(Penny gasps)

32:38.016 --> 32:38.849
Sorry.

32:45.788 --> 32:50.788
(electrical hissing)
(woman groans)

32:56.738 --> 32:59.238
(thug groans)

33:13.902 --> 33:14.735
- Come on.

33:15.809 --> 33:17.700
Don't be such a baby.

33:17.700 --> 33:19.886
No more mister nice guy.

33:19.886 --> 33:21.969
(gong reverberating)

33:21.969 --> 33:23.030
- [Kay] Can't you go any faster?

33:23.030 --> 33:25.202
- Your sister's holding us up.

33:25.202 --> 33:26.035
- I don't have any shoes.

33:26.035 --> 33:26.868
It hurts.

33:28.134 --> 33:30.369
(gun firing)

33:30.369 --> 33:33.153
- Son of a bitch has a gun.

33:35.700 --> 33:37.200
- How many shells you got left?

33:37.200 --> 33:38.240
- Two.

33:38.240 --> 33:39.520
- Don't waste them all.

33:39.520 --> 33:41.610
- Oh, you are a freaking genius.

33:41.610 --> 33:43.430
You two go around and try to cut them off.

33:43.430 --> 33:44.923
I'm gonna come up behind.

33:50.930 --> 33:51.792
Drop it.

33:51.792 --> 33:52.625
(gong reverberating)

33:52.625 --> 33:53.893
I said put the crossbow down.

33:56.587 --> 33:59.420
(thug whimpering)

34:03.650 --> 34:04.653
See that guys.

34:05.780 --> 34:08.773
We had one chick to play
with, now we got two.

34:09.710 --> 34:12.400
That's what we get for being good boys.

34:12.400 --> 34:13.989
Tie the girls up.

34:13.989 --> 34:15.580
- What about him?

34:15.580 --> 34:17.730
- He won't be any
problem once I shoot him.

34:21.168 --> 34:24.136
(gong reverberating)

34:24.136 --> 34:25.136
- Holy shit!

34:26.371 --> 34:28.871
- What are you trying to pull?

34:33.719 --> 34:36.306
(thug moans)

34:36.306 --> 34:38.126
(Kay yells)

34:38.126 --> 34:40.958
(creature growls)

34:44.338 --> 34:47.273
(metallic scrapping)

34:47.273 --> 34:48.106
- No.

34:48.106 --> 34:48.938
(gun fires)

34:48.938 --> 34:51.688
(creature moans)

34:53.268 --> 34:56.018
(wound gurgling)

35:02.175 --> 35:03.968
(creature growls)

35:03.968 --> 35:06.100
- No, don't.

35:06.100 --> 35:07.303
Please don't.

35:12.448 --> 35:15.115
(ominous music)

35:29.070 --> 35:30.150
- What the--

35:30.150 --> 35:32.270
- [Kay] I can't believe
you would be so stupid.

35:32.270 --> 35:33.573
What the hell do you think you were doing?

35:33.573 --> 35:34.886
- I was looking for more supplies.

35:34.886 --> 35:35.719
- [Kagen] In the middle of the night?

35:35.719 --> 35:36.810
You could have been killed.

35:36.810 --> 35:37.643
- Worse.

35:37.643 --> 35:38.476
- There's nothing worse.

35:38.476 --> 35:39.309
- Shut up.

35:39.309 --> 35:40.580
What the hell's wrong with you.

35:40.580 --> 35:41.980
- I'm sorry, okay.

35:41.980 --> 35:42.840
I'm sorry.

35:42.840 --> 35:44.170
I wanted to help.

35:44.170 --> 35:46.620
And if I went in daytime
you would have stopped me.

35:46.620 --> 35:48.320
- You're damn right we would have.

35:52.226 --> 35:54.809
(Penny crying)

36:00.260 --> 36:02.820
Do you have any idea how
awful it would have been

36:02.820 --> 36:04.313
for us if we had lost you?

36:14.640 --> 36:15.560
- Come on now.

36:15.560 --> 36:17.453
Go to bed, scoot.

36:30.000 --> 36:30.833
- I'm sorry.

36:32.609 --> 36:33.526
- For what?

36:35.150 --> 36:36.950
- For what I was thinking about you.

36:39.460 --> 36:41.610
- Anyone would have
thought the same thing.

36:43.190 --> 36:44.890
- Maybe you're not such a bad guy.

36:45.740 --> 36:46.870
- Are you kidding?

36:46.870 --> 36:47.943
I'm a prince.

36:50.400 --> 36:52.996
What the hell was that creature we saw?

36:52.996 --> 36:54.430
- The one who saved us?

36:54.430 --> 36:55.263
- I guess.

36:56.520 --> 36:57.370
- I have no idea.

36:59.270 --> 37:00.570
- It seemed to recognize you.

37:00.570 --> 37:02.510
- Well, I've never seen him before.

37:02.510 --> 37:03.343
- Him?

37:13.379 --> 37:15.523
You know a kiss on the
cheek won't hold me forever.

37:15.523 --> 37:16.948
- [Kay] It'll have to do.

37:16.948 --> 37:19.698
(Blake chuckles)

37:26.702 --> 37:29.110
(weapon firing)

37:29.110 --> 37:30.040
- What was that?

37:30.890 --> 37:32.290
- Nothing, go back to sleep.

37:38.649 --> 37:39.482
(electricity crackling)

37:39.482 --> 37:41.940
What the hell's going on in here?

37:41.940 --> 37:43.680
- I think I figured this device out.

37:43.680 --> 37:44.730
- [Blake] What gives?

37:45.565 --> 37:47.480
- Remember how I told
you I thought the aliens

37:47.480 --> 37:48.870
were from another dimension?

37:48.870 --> 37:49.703
- [Blake] Um-hm.

37:49.703 --> 37:51.002
- Now I'm sure of it.

37:51.002 --> 37:51.835
(monitor crackling)

37:51.835 --> 37:52.668
- Zayden?

37:52.668 --> 37:53.501
Zayden, are you there?

37:53.501 --> 37:54.560
I lost signal for a minute.

37:54.560 --> 37:55.870
- I'm here, Miles.

37:55.870 --> 37:59.272
You were right about the
auxiliary vortex field.

37:59.272 --> 38:02.920
- I told you it was dangerous
and not to mess with it.

38:02.920 --> 38:04.840
- I know that's what you were right about.

38:04.840 --> 38:07.090
I think we're on to something here, Miles.

38:07.090 --> 38:09.950
- All right, I'll recheck
those calculations

38:09.950 --> 38:12.210
and get back to you.

38:12.210 --> 38:14.048
- My fellow scientists
and I have been analyzing

38:14.048 --> 38:16.800
the physical principles behind this device

38:16.800 --> 38:20.210
and it seems that the
way this device functions

38:20.210 --> 38:23.480
indicates an underlying quantum principle

38:23.480 --> 38:26.677
that does not exist in our universe.

38:26.677 --> 38:30.110
What I'm trying to say is this gun here

38:30.110 --> 38:34.223
that I am holding shouldn't
exist in our universe either.

38:35.520 --> 38:37.108
- You mean like antimatter.

38:37.108 --> 38:40.380
- No, no, no-no, well yes.

38:40.380 --> 38:42.154
But completely different.

38:42.154 --> 38:43.880
- Gotcha.

38:43.880 --> 38:45.640
- So you don't understand
how the gun works?

38:45.640 --> 38:48.110
- No-no, I understand how it works,

38:48.110 --> 38:51.060
I just don't understand why it works?

38:51.060 --> 38:53.483
- Well, just try not to blow
anything else up tonight.

38:54.570 --> 38:57.318
- So, you figured this out
using all this rubbish?

38:57.318 --> 38:58.490
- No, Mr. Blake.

38:58.490 --> 38:59.470
- Just Blake.

38:59.470 --> 39:01.153
- I figured it out using this.

39:02.042 --> 39:05.036
(gong reverberating)

39:05.036 --> 39:06.397
(footsteps crunching)

39:06.397 --> 39:09.064
(door creaking)

39:15.791 --> 39:18.874
(creature breathing)

39:21.916 --> 39:24.749
(creature growls)

39:31.556 --> 39:33.112
(Penny screams)

39:33.112 --> 39:35.829
- [Blake] Oh, hell, now what?

39:35.829 --> 39:38.219
(gong reverberating)

39:38.219 --> 39:40.886
(ominous music)

39:55.611 --> 39:58.444
(creature growls)

39:59.296 --> 40:00.973
(suspenseful music)

40:00.973 --> 40:03.806
(creature growls)

40:07.355 --> 40:08.605
- Put her down!

40:09.950 --> 40:11.743
(creature growls)

40:11.743 --> 40:13.953
Everybody out of the corridor, now.

40:17.123 --> 40:18.719
(glass shattering)

40:18.719 --> 40:21.219
(gas hissing)

40:31.957 --> 40:34.707
(creature moans)

40:49.310 --> 40:51.700
I didn't know if the gas would work.

40:51.700 --> 40:54.163
You know if the biology was too different.

40:55.280 --> 40:57.090
- It looks half human.

40:57.090 --> 40:59.203
- I think he was human, once.

41:01.700 --> 41:03.290
- Penny's fine.

41:03.290 --> 41:04.790
- It was a harmless soporific.

41:05.770 --> 41:08.170
Blake tells me you've seen this creature?

41:08.170 --> 41:10.010
- Yeah, he saved us from the thugs.

41:10.010 --> 41:12.233
He must've followed us back here.

41:12.233 --> 41:14.460
- I sure hope those chains hold.

41:14.460 --> 41:17.363
- They will, if I keep him tranquilized.

41:19.150 --> 41:21.093
Is this the creature you
were telling me about?

41:24.874 --> 41:25.957
Poor bastard.

41:26.930 --> 41:29.722
- You haven't seen him
rip a man's arm off.

41:29.722 --> 41:31.290
(low humming)

41:31.290 --> 41:32.123
- What is that?

41:33.640 --> 41:34.890
- They're running a scan.

41:38.172 --> 41:41.422
(explosion thundering)

41:43.348 --> 41:45.716
- Are they coming this way?

41:45.716 --> 41:47.454
- It's hard to tell.

41:47.454 --> 41:50.454
(scan beam humming)

41:52.963 --> 41:54.668
(scanner vibrating)

41:54.668 --> 41:58.621
(equipment sputtering)

41:58.621 --> 42:02.317
(scanner's whining)

42:02.317 --> 42:05.567
(creature screeching)

42:16.938 --> 42:19.855
(scanners whining)

42:28.620 --> 42:31.037
(he screams)

42:36.363 --> 42:39.613
(equipment sputtering)

42:44.883 --> 42:47.633
(creature moans)

42:59.672 --> 43:02.422
(creature yells)

43:06.531 --> 43:09.781
(electrical crackling)

43:13.493 --> 43:14.466
(Penny screams)

43:14.466 --> 43:16.502
- It's okay, it's okay.

43:16.502 --> 43:17.419
We're safe.

43:18.782 --> 43:21.699
(scanners whining)

43:24.830 --> 43:27.975
(creature howling)

43:27.975 --> 43:30.475
(Kagen gasps)

43:33.090 --> 43:34.420
(alien creature chirps)

43:34.420 --> 43:37.993
(creature yells)

43:37.993 --> 43:41.160
(scan rays pulsating)

43:48.982 --> 43:52.482
(alien creature gurgling)

43:54.752 --> 43:56.838
(bones cracking)

43:56.838 --> 44:00.085
(weapons pulsing)

44:00.085 --> 44:01.491
(creature yells)

44:01.491 --> 44:04.237
(explosion booming)

44:04.237 --> 44:07.404
(ship engine revving)

44:21.222 --> 44:23.560
(ship engine sputtering)

44:23.560 --> 44:26.643
(electronic humming)

44:36.616 --> 44:39.192
(scanner humming)

44:39.192 --> 44:41.005
(weapons pulsing)

44:41.005 --> 44:42.644
(explosion roaring)

44:42.644 --> 44:45.477
(creature growls)

44:50.724 --> 44:52.960
- No, please don't kill him.

44:52.960 --> 44:54.143
We need one alive.

44:56.264 --> 44:57.300
We need one alive.

44:57.300 --> 45:01.130
It's very important, please.

45:01.130 --> 45:01.963
- It is him.

45:04.254 --> 45:07.087
(creature growls)

45:10.324 --> 45:12.324
- Come, help me get the specimen inside.

45:24.887 --> 45:28.304
(lab equipment blipping)

45:37.430 --> 45:38.673
Extraordinary.

45:45.075 --> 45:46.590
- You know you're really
taking your chances

45:46.590 --> 45:48.650
being out in broad daylight.

45:48.650 --> 45:49.863
- I can't find the door.

45:50.720 --> 45:52.720
- Well we watched the goon
climb out of this thing

45:52.720 --> 45:54.750
and the door was right about here.

45:54.750 --> 45:56.937
- Yeah, not there is it?

45:56.937 --> 45:58.630
- It has to be, I saw it.

45:58.630 --> 46:00.200
- Well, it's not there now.

46:00.200 --> 46:02.810
I've looked over every inch
of this thing a dozen times.

46:02.810 --> 46:05.180
There's no catch or anything anywhere.

46:05.180 --> 46:06.253
- There has to be.

46:08.110 --> 46:10.940
- How's the professor
coming with his specimen?

46:10.940 --> 46:12.640
- Like a kid on Christmas morning.

46:14.050 --> 46:16.000
- I can't believe you don't
have the thing tied down.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.972
- It's too weak to cause any trouble.

46:17.972 --> 46:18.904
- Screw that.

46:18.904 --> 46:20.690
He outta be buried in concrete.

46:20.690 --> 46:22.960
- I couldn't examine him then could I?

46:22.960 --> 46:24.000
- Yeah, but what if he gets up?

46:24.000 --> 46:26.530
- I was right about the eyes.

46:26.530 --> 46:28.163
Purely vestigial organs.

46:29.160 --> 46:30.820
His primary means of perception

46:30.820 --> 46:33.020
seems to be through his skin.

46:33.020 --> 46:34.960
- It sees through its skin?

46:34.960 --> 46:36.520
- Sort of.

46:36.520 --> 46:37.440
It's not that unusual.

46:37.440 --> 46:41.910
I mean certain earthly
creatures can detect vibration,

46:41.910 --> 46:43.393
ultraviolet radiation,

46:44.650 --> 46:46.720
with pulses through their skin.

46:46.720 --> 46:48.307
- [Blake] What's this?

46:48.307 --> 46:50.407
- It's some sort of helmet he was wearing.

46:53.612 --> 46:56.532
(helmet whining)

46:56.532 --> 46:57.615
- [Blake] Ow.

47:01.163 --> 47:03.746
(Blake gasps)

47:03.746 --> 47:05.286
- It's horrifying isn't it?

47:05.286 --> 47:07.240
I tried it on myself earlier.

47:07.240 --> 47:08.420
- Then why did you let him do it?

47:08.420 --> 47:09.910
- To see how he'd react.

47:09.910 --> 47:11.000
- Thanks a lot.

47:11.000 --> 47:14.080
- It seems to be some
sort of adaptive device

47:14.080 --> 47:16.420
that allows the aliens to use their senses

47:16.420 --> 47:18.663
to perceive things in our universe.

47:19.610 --> 47:21.210
- So when I tried it on

47:21.210 --> 47:24.610
it made my senses work more like theirs?

47:24.610 --> 47:25.443
- Possibly.

47:30.562 --> 47:33.039
(helmet whining)

47:33.039 --> 47:36.610
- Kay, I can see you, but
I can see past you, too.

47:36.610 --> 47:39.672
Like I can see in the walls.

47:39.672 --> 47:43.660
It's not really seeing, but
it's like I know it's there.

47:46.630 --> 47:48.023
- You all right?

47:48.023 --> 47:48.856
- I think so.

47:49.710 --> 47:51.310
Oh, yeah.

47:51.310 --> 47:52.143
Yeah.

47:54.798 --> 47:55.631
(he exhales)

47:55.631 --> 47:57.053
Oh, yeah, that helps.

47:57.053 --> 47:58.093
- There's one more thing.

47:59.760 --> 48:00.593
Look at this.

48:02.860 --> 48:05.610
(device humming)

48:09.641 --> 48:10.826
- What is that?

48:10.826 --> 48:12.128
- I don't know.

48:12.128 --> 48:14.100
But I'd love to get a better look at it.

48:14.100 --> 48:15.500
- Well, what's stopping you?

48:16.454 --> 48:18.040
- It would require surgery.

48:18.040 --> 48:20.303
I don't have the skills or the equipment.

48:23.790 --> 48:25.455
- [Blake] Here you go.

48:25.455 --> 48:26.440
- Don't be ridiculous.

48:26.440 --> 48:27.806
I know nothing about its anatomy.

48:27.806 --> 48:29.680
I could kill it.

48:29.680 --> 48:31.660
- Isn't that kind of the point?

48:31.660 --> 48:33.230
- You're talking like a barbarian.

48:33.230 --> 48:34.063
- Am I?

48:35.120 --> 48:36.570
These things invaded our world.

48:36.570 --> 48:37.960
Destroyed our civilization.

48:37.960 --> 48:40.040
Killed how many innocent people.

48:40.040 --> 48:41.900
If cutting one of them
up will help us learn

48:41.900 --> 48:42.733
a way to defeat them,

48:42.733 --> 48:45.340
I don't think we can
afford to be squeamish.

48:45.340 --> 48:47.880
- Even in war, there are limits.

48:47.880 --> 48:48.790
- This isn't war.

48:48.790 --> 48:50.640
Wars end, life goes on.

48:50.640 --> 48:52.520
This is something entirely different.

48:52.520 --> 48:53.520
If we don't find a way
to stop these things,

48:53.520 --> 48:55.551
there won't be anything left.

48:55.551 --> 48:56.384
- [Kay] Blake!

48:56.384 --> 48:59.467
(metallic vibrating)

49:10.933 --> 49:12.240
- All right, professor.

49:12.240 --> 49:14.202
You wanna closer look at this what's it,

49:14.202 --> 49:15.907
it's right about here wasn't it.

49:15.907 --> 49:18.824
(creature screams)

49:21.515 --> 49:24.432
(organs squishing)

49:32.388 --> 49:34.888
(Blake sighs)

49:36.305 --> 49:37.726
There you go.

49:37.726 --> 49:40.393
(body whirring)

49:49.928 --> 49:51.717
- How's that?

49:51.717 --> 49:53.290
- Not the first time I've been stabbed,

49:53.290 --> 49:55.180
probably won't be the last.

49:55.180 --> 49:56.013
Thanks.

49:56.920 --> 49:57.753
- Does that hurt much?

49:57.753 --> 49:58.586
(he scoffs)

49:58.586 --> 50:00.000
- Got my painkiller right here.

50:01.842 --> 50:04.259
(he exhales)

50:09.100 --> 50:10.830
- What is that?

50:10.830 --> 50:13.653
- It's either very new
moonshine or very old kerosene.

50:15.700 --> 50:20.203
So, guess you probably think
I'm a barbarian now, too?

50:24.480 --> 50:27.480
- You did what you thought had
to do in a really tough spot.

50:28.830 --> 50:31.220
Who knows, maybe this
will be the turning point.

50:31.220 --> 50:33.993
Maybe future generations
will think of you as a hero.

50:35.200 --> 50:36.033
- Yeah?

50:37.240 --> 50:39.040
If there are any future generations.

50:40.330 --> 50:42.750
- Don't you think you
should go easy on that?

50:42.750 --> 50:43.583
- Are you kidding?

50:43.583 --> 50:46.590
If there's one thing I can
do it's handle my liquor.

50:46.590 --> 50:48.080
- Can you see it all right, Miles?

50:48.080 --> 50:49.455
- I can, I can but the picture's--

50:49.455 --> 50:50.288
(monitor crackling)

50:50.288 --> 50:52.107
cutting out.

50:52.107 --> 50:54.690
You got that implanted in the alien?

50:54.690 --> 50:57.213
- Yes, when it was surgically removed,

50:58.320 --> 51:00.270
the alien dissolved.

51:00.270 --> 51:02.320
Almost as if the molecular
bonds had broken down.

51:02.320 --> 51:03.960
- That's impossible.

51:03.960 --> 51:05.843
The resulting energy released--

51:05.843 --> 51:06.920
- Yes, yes I know.

51:06.920 --> 51:08.619
I was making an analogy.

51:08.619 --> 51:10.200
(monitor crackling)

51:10.200 --> 51:13.110
- It almost looks like
some type of receiver.

51:13.110 --> 51:14.490
- Yes, but for what?

51:14.490 --> 51:17.320
- [Miles] Luther and his
team have been investigating

51:17.320 --> 51:19.980
an anomalous energy source in this sector.

51:19.980 --> 51:21.719
- What kind of energy?

51:21.719 --> 51:24.050
- Not sure, it seems to be

51:24.050 --> 51:28.640
some sort of sub-quantum plasma vibration.

51:28.640 --> 51:30.842
- Do you think there
could be some connection?

51:30.842 --> 51:32.720
- I think, who the hell knows?

51:32.720 --> 51:33.953
But, it's possible?

51:36.107 --> 51:38.403
- Don't think you've had enough of that?

51:38.403 --> 51:41.663
- I guess so, since there ain't anymore.

51:41.663 --> 51:43.734
- How're you feeling?

51:43.734 --> 51:45.317
- Pretty damn good.

51:48.990 --> 51:50.710
This is weird.

51:50.710 --> 51:54.380
Really weird, like when I
had that thing on my head,

51:54.380 --> 51:56.300
only backwards.

51:56.300 --> 51:57.653
Does that make any sense?

51:58.530 --> 51:59.908
- No.

51:59.908 --> 52:01.158
- Oh, I guess it doesn't.

52:04.320 --> 52:05.700
- What?

52:05.700 --> 52:07.000
Are you feeling all right?

52:08.300 --> 52:09.500
- I'm feeling brilliant.

52:17.370 --> 52:18.473
Hi, you cutie.

52:20.330 --> 52:21.200
- You're drunk.

52:21.200 --> 52:22.163
- You're right.

52:23.709 --> 52:24.542
Mwah.

52:28.410 --> 52:30.180
- Send me the coordinates, Miles.

52:30.180 --> 52:31.150
This is important.

52:31.150 --> 52:33.150
This could be the key we're looking for.

52:35.495 --> 52:37.650
- Jayden, Jayden.

52:37.650 --> 52:39.833
- Not now, I'm busy.

52:39.833 --> 52:41.900
I'll break them down and
send you the technical specs

52:41.900 --> 52:43.090
as soon as possible.

52:43.090 --> 52:46.370
- If this device is what I think it is,

52:46.370 --> 52:48.920
it's gonna answer a lot of questions.

52:48.920 --> 52:52.713
- Sometimes when I'm drunk, I'm brilliant.

52:57.130 --> 52:59.267
No, it's okay, it's okay.

53:00.172 --> 53:01.226
(gong reverberating)

53:01.226 --> 53:02.059
Oh, it's messed up.

53:02.059 --> 53:03.593
It's so messed up.

53:04.465 --> 53:05.703
Oh, it's so messed up.

53:09.462 --> 53:10.557
But I get it now.

53:14.500 --> 53:15.743
Watch this.

53:19.409 --> 53:22.028
(gong reverberating)

53:22.028 --> 53:23.861
Don't be scared, babe.

53:24.883 --> 53:27.966
(metallic scrapping)

53:32.980 --> 53:34.234
- What are you doing?

53:34.234 --> 53:36.999
- I think I can fly this thing.

53:36.999 --> 53:37.960
(she scoffs)

53:37.960 --> 53:38.867
- How?

53:38.867 --> 53:41.087
There aren't any controls.

53:41.087 --> 53:42.883
Anyway this ship is wrecked.

53:44.080 --> 53:47.310
- Self repair function.

53:47.310 --> 53:48.900
Somewhere around here.

53:49.790 --> 53:52.540
(energy pulsing)

53:54.132 --> 53:55.299
- What's that?

54:01.050 --> 54:02.940
- Ship's all better.

54:02.940 --> 54:03.900
You gotta drink?

54:03.900 --> 54:04.997
- No.

54:04.997 --> 54:08.160
- Ah, too bad, if I
sober up, we're screwed.

54:08.160 --> 54:10.917
Okay, here goes.

54:10.917 --> 54:11.750
(instruments pulsing)

54:11.750 --> 54:12.606
- What are you doing?

54:12.606 --> 54:14.856
- Shh, I gotta concentrate.

54:16.372 --> 54:18.122
Quiet, I gotta think.

54:21.202 --> 54:23.952
(energy whining)

54:28.549 --> 54:31.799
(ship engines roaring)

54:47.351 --> 54:48.768
- Zayden, Zayden.

54:50.353 --> 54:51.186
Zayden!

54:54.604 --> 54:57.854
(ship engines revving)

54:59.603 --> 55:00.436
Look.

55:02.723 --> 55:04.183
- Don't be scared, babe.

55:04.183 --> 55:05.247
I feel great.

55:05.247 --> 55:06.599
- Yeah, that's what scares me.

55:06.599 --> 55:09.849
(ship engines roaring)

55:16.010 --> 55:17.510
- What are those idiots doing?

55:18.720 --> 55:19.683
- I don't know.

55:21.280 --> 55:23.133
Making a miracle maybe.

55:25.950 --> 55:28.220
- Blake, this is scary.

55:28.220 --> 55:29.898
I can't see anything.

55:29.898 --> 55:32.135
- So what, you're not driving.

55:32.135 --> 55:33.965
- I know, but still.

55:33.965 --> 55:35.058
- Relax, babe.

55:35.058 --> 55:36.975
I know where I'm going.

55:38.303 --> 55:40.947
- Oh, but 're gonna get us killed.

55:40.947 --> 55:41.800
- No way kid.

55:41.800 --> 55:43.505
I got the hang of this thing.

55:43.505 --> 55:45.380
- But you can't see anything.

55:45.380 --> 55:46.213
- I don't need to see.

55:46.213 --> 55:47.075
The ship sees.

55:47.075 --> 55:49.992
I know everything that's out there.

55:51.244 --> 55:52.457
(wood splintering)

55:52.457 --> 55:54.449
- What the hell was that?

55:54.449 --> 55:57.005
- I think it used to be a barn.

55:57.005 --> 55:58.581
- Blake you've made your point.

55:58.581 --> 56:00.125
You're wonderful, I get it.

56:00.125 --> 56:01.946
Just take us back.

56:01.946 --> 56:02.779
- Okay.

56:04.460 --> 56:06.377
Anything for you, baby.

56:07.295 --> 56:09.628
(Kay sighs)

56:11.811 --> 56:12.644
- Woo-wee.

56:17.128 --> 56:20.128
(ship beam humming)

56:21.025 --> 56:24.108
(controls vibrating)

56:32.091 --> 56:33.332
Uh-oh.

56:33.332 --> 56:34.470
- Uh-oh?

56:34.470 --> 56:36.176
- We got company, Auntie Em.

56:36.176 --> 56:37.234
- What kind of company?

56:37.234 --> 56:39.138
- Another one of these ships.

56:39.138 --> 56:40.181
- Hell.

56:40.181 --> 56:41.194
- Don't worry about it.

56:41.194 --> 56:43.502
They'll think we're friends, right?

56:43.502 --> 56:44.919
What else could they think?

56:44.919 --> 56:45.945
(ship weapons pulsing)

56:45.945 --> 56:48.278
- Whew, this isn't friendly.

56:50.168 --> 56:51.831
- Oh, you wanna play, huh?

56:51.831 --> 56:53.248
Okay, let's play.

56:54.339 --> 56:57.474
(ship weapons pulsing)

56:57.474 --> 57:00.724
(ship engines revving)

57:06.767 --> 57:09.767
(explosion booming)

57:12.440 --> 57:13.857
That was awesome.

57:16.170 --> 57:18.319
Oh man, this isn't good.

57:18.319 --> 57:19.292
- What, what isn't good.

57:19.292 --> 57:21.126
- Oh, crap, I'm losing it.

57:21.126 --> 57:22.163
What's going on?

57:22.163 --> 57:24.633
- Adrenaline rush, you're sobering up.

57:27.831 --> 57:29.041
- I think I'm gonna puke.

57:29.041 --> 57:29.874
- No, no.

57:29.874 --> 57:30.857
- [Blake] I'm gonna puke.

57:30.857 --> 57:32.024
- Set us down.

57:33.254 --> 57:34.254
Set us down.

57:36.859 --> 57:40.942
(ship engines whining)

57:40.942 --> 57:41.775
- Duck.

58:08.073 --> 58:11.490
(ship engine sputtering)

58:15.917 --> 58:16.750
- No, no.

58:20.442 --> 58:22.942
(Blake gasps)

58:24.410 --> 58:26.502
Thanks, man, I owe ya.

58:26.502 --> 58:27.335
- It was nothing.

58:27.335 --> 58:28.640
- Not to me it wasn't.

58:28.640 --> 58:31.550
I almost left the fun parts in there.

58:31.550 --> 58:32.383
- [Kay] How's your head?

58:32.383 --> 58:34.996
- [Blake] Oh, no need to shout.

58:34.996 --> 58:36.403
- [Kay] Serves you right.

58:38.010 --> 58:38.913
- What happened?

58:39.850 --> 58:41.590
- I was hoping you could tell us.

58:41.590 --> 58:42.480
- I don't know.

58:42.480 --> 58:44.750
My shoulder was aching from the stab wound

58:44.750 --> 58:47.810
and I took a few drinks to deaden the pain

58:47.810 --> 58:50.390
and I guess I got a little tipsy.

58:50.390 --> 58:52.030
- A little tipsy.

58:52.030 --> 58:54.930
- And then, and then
suddenly something clicked

58:54.930 --> 58:58.090
and all those weird scary images

58:58.090 --> 59:02.200
when I was wearing the
helmet seemed to make sense.

59:02.200 --> 59:05.260
Like I knew that if I got it,

59:05.260 --> 59:09.593
I could fly the ship and
we'd understand each other.

59:11.120 --> 59:13.170
- A symbiotic relationship with the ship.

59:14.020 --> 59:17.083
That fits with everything
we've learned about the aliens.

59:18.150 --> 59:19.110
They're mindless.

59:19.110 --> 59:20.900
Essentially drones.

59:20.900 --> 59:24.200
Once the alcohol began to
affect the neurotransmitters

59:24.200 --> 59:25.760
in your brain.

59:25.760 --> 59:27.870
- I became a drone?

59:27.870 --> 59:30.493
- But you still retained
your human instincts.

59:31.740 --> 59:33.340
- Let me tell you something, Professor.

59:33.340 --> 59:35.410
Those guys can't fight for squat.

59:35.410 --> 59:37.130
All the destruction they rained down.

59:37.130 --> 59:38.610
It was like crop dusters.

59:38.610 --> 59:40.900
Just spraying a cornfield.

59:40.900 --> 59:42.680
Against an experienced fighter pilot

59:42.680 --> 59:43.790
those guys are hopeless.

59:43.790 --> 59:45.660
- Since when are you an experienced pilot?

59:45.660 --> 59:47.120
- Since you shut up.

59:47.120 --> 59:48.550
Let me tell you something.

59:48.550 --> 59:50.160
A handful of guys with ships like that,

59:50.160 --> 59:51.713
could take this planet back.

59:53.010 --> 59:55.380
- There might be a better way.

59:55.380 --> 59:56.323
- [Kay] What's that?

59:57.670 --> 59:59.880
- If the aliens are from another dimension

59:59.880 --> 01:00:02.700
as we've suspected, it
should be impossible

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:04.180
for them to exist in ours.

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:06.100
Their physical essence would vibrate

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:08.240
at a different frequency so to speak,

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:12.300
unless some device were
compensating for this discrepancy.

01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:13.133
- So this is the device

01:00:13.133 --> 01:00:15.860
that allows them to
exist in our dimension?

01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:18.680
- No, I believe that's just a receiver.

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:21.730
They're all controlled from
these central locations

01:00:21.730 --> 01:00:23.410
scattered around the planet.

01:00:23.410 --> 01:00:24.690
Command posts, if you will.

01:00:24.690 --> 01:00:27.640
- So we need to find the
command posts and destroy them.

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:31.120
- The problem is we're
crippled by a lack of weaponry.

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.580
- I've got a weapon.

01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:34.670
- Yeah, but you have to be
stinking drunk to use it.

01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:36.403
- Sounds like a win-win to me.

01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:38.560
- [Kay] We got this.

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:39.810
- Oh, that's cooking wine.

01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:41.460
Bad cooking wine.

01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:42.490
- It smells like vinegar.

01:00:42.490 --> 01:00:44.486
You wouldn't even get a buzz off of that.

01:00:44.486 --> 01:00:45.860
You gotta have something else.

01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:47.490
- We don't do much drinking around here.

01:00:47.490 --> 01:00:49.620
We need sober heads on our shoulders.

01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:52.160
- Well right now you need a
drunken head on your pilot.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:53.700
- I know where there's booze.

01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:54.920
- [Kay] You do?

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:57.000
- Back where those guys had me.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.010
There was a lot of booze there.

01:00:58.010 --> 01:00:59.700
- [Blake] Yeah, that's right.

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:01.100
Well, no time like the present.

01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:03.070
- Wait, better to go at night.

01:01:03.070 --> 01:01:04.500
Less likely to be spotted.

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:05.691
- [Blake] Yeah, you might be right.

01:01:05.691 --> 01:01:06.810
- And I'll go with you.

01:01:06.810 --> 01:01:07.643
- Why?

01:01:07.643 --> 01:01:08.570
- In case there's trouble.

01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:10.371
- If you come along, I
know there'll be trouble.

01:01:10.371 --> 01:01:13.454
(gong reverberating)

01:01:15.684 --> 01:01:16.970
- [Kay] It looks empty.

01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:17.890
- [Blake] Yeah, well it would be.

01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:19.060
They're all dead.

01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:21.380
- It doesn't mean someone
else hasn't moved in.

01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:24.730
- Yeah, I'll reconnoiter, you wait here.

01:01:24.730 --> 01:01:25.763
- Oh, sure.

01:01:26.970 --> 01:01:28.870
- You are one stubborn little cupcake.

01:01:34.629 --> 01:01:36.046
- Mm, here we go.

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:41.910
- [Kay] There's more over here.

01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:43.610
- Bring it here and start packing.

01:01:49.471 --> 01:01:52.086
(bottles clanging)

01:01:52.086 --> 01:01:54.753
(ominous music)

01:01:56.918 --> 01:02:00.152
(Blake moans)

01:02:00.152 --> 01:02:02.910
- I don't like people
messing with my stuff.

01:02:02.910 --> 01:02:07.170
- Ah, damn you got booze, you got guns.

01:02:07.170 --> 01:02:10.293
Looks like I signed up
with the wrong side.

01:02:11.850 --> 01:02:13.980
- [Thug] Too late to switch sides now.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:15.190
- Are you sure?

01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:16.023
- Oh, yeah.

01:02:16.930 --> 01:02:18.023
Get up, have a seat.

01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:24.123
Take those chains.

01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:27.489
Tie him up nice and tight.

01:02:27.489 --> 01:02:29.439
I don't want him messing with my plans.

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:31.643
- [Kay] What if I don't?

01:02:32.517 --> 01:02:34.330
- Then I'll kill you both.

01:02:34.330 --> 01:02:35.691
Nice and slow.

01:02:35.691 --> 01:02:37.358
An elbow, a kneecap.

01:02:41.938 --> 01:02:44.771
(chains rattling)

01:02:55.610 --> 01:02:57.410
Glad you didn't try anything stupid.

01:02:58.840 --> 01:02:59.673
Come here.

01:03:03.070 --> 01:03:04.303
Take your clothes off.

01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:11.251
Don't do what I tell you,
then I'm gonna kill him.

01:03:11.251 --> 01:03:13.933
Nice and slow, til he can't walk anymore.

01:03:17.930 --> 01:03:18.763
Whoa, whoa.

01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:20.783
Make it slow.

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:23.263
Make it sexy.

01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:25.930
I wanna get warmed up first.

01:03:35.576 --> 01:03:38.076
(he chuckles)

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:41.689
Oh, yeah.

01:03:41.689 --> 01:03:44.341
No fricking golem's
gonna save you this time.

01:03:44.341 --> 01:03:47.258
(wood splintering)

01:03:48.211 --> 01:03:49.710
Oh, come on.

01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:50.644
(creature roars)

01:03:50.644 --> 01:03:53.977
(thug screams)

01:03:53.977 --> 01:03:56.727
(blood dripping)

01:04:06.237 --> 01:04:07.820
- Alex, wait, Alex.

01:04:13.449 --> 01:04:15.680
I always knew that it was you.

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:17.343
You don't have to hide from us.

01:04:18.434 --> 01:04:19.767
- No better way.

01:04:20.730 --> 01:04:21.713
- We can help you.

01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:24.500
You know how brilliant Zayden is.

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.610
He and his colleagues will find a way

01:04:26.610 --> 01:04:27.943
to help make you better.

01:04:27.943 --> 01:04:30.443
(Alex laughs)

01:04:31.303 --> 01:04:32.844
- [Alex] Better?

01:04:32.844 --> 01:04:37.011
I can see things and hear
things you can't imagine

01:04:38.772 --> 01:04:42.041
I am strongest creature on the planet.

01:04:42.041 --> 01:04:44.041
Nothing can hurt me now.

01:04:45.331 --> 01:04:47.581
How can you make me better?

01:04:49.508 --> 01:04:50.817
Just a waste.

01:04:50.817 --> 01:04:51.817
I want this.

01:04:52.927 --> 01:04:54.344
I have a purpose.

01:04:55.529 --> 01:04:58.196
When you need me, I'll be there.

01:05:00.386 --> 01:05:04.053
(Alex's footsteps thudding)

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:23.666
- To Alex.

01:05:23.666 --> 01:05:24.499
- [All] To Alex.

01:05:26.730 --> 01:05:29.450
- Now, that's enough.

01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:32.200
We have to conserve the alcohol.

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:34.590
We're gonna need it for tomorrow morning.

01:05:34.590 --> 01:05:35.930
- So soon?

01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:38.710
- We found the closest of
the alien control centers.

01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:40.590
It's only about 50 miles from here.

01:05:40.590 --> 01:05:43.040
I'll give you the exact
coordinates in the morning.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.250
- Wouldn't it be safer to go at night?

01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:47.130
- No, it's better guarded at night.

01:05:47.130 --> 01:05:49.100
They have some kind of sentries on there.

01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:50.390
I don't know what they are exactly,

01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:53.803
but from what I can gather
they're quite formidable.

01:05:55.809 --> 01:05:56.642
(Zayden sighs)

01:05:56.642 --> 01:06:01.600
Well, I have one of my
miraculous gadgets to finish

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:03.800
and I think you all should get some rest.

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:07.440
Tomorrow could be one of
the most important days

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:08.963
in the history of the world.

01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:21.743
- Good night, everyone.

01:06:25.587 --> 01:06:27.853
(door clicking)

01:06:27.853 --> 01:06:29.520
- Good night, Penny.

01:06:37.176 --> 01:06:39.843
(door clicking)

01:06:40.971 --> 01:06:44.304
- Well, I guess I outta get to bed, too.

01:06:47.259 --> 01:06:50.610
I got me some serious
drinking to do in the morning.

01:06:54.729 --> 01:06:58.591
- Goodnight.

01:06:58.591 --> 01:06:59.591
- Goodnight.

01:07:09.170 --> 01:07:10.370
- You want some company?

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.643
- Why Miss, Miss.

01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:19.923
Say, do you have a last name?

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:23.130
- Flanagan.

01:07:23.130 --> 01:07:25.410
- Do you have a first one?

01:07:25.410 --> 01:07:27.053
- Michael.

01:07:27.053 --> 01:07:27.970
- [Kay] Hm.

01:07:31.321 --> 01:07:34.093
(crow cawing)

01:07:34.093 --> 01:07:36.531
- Come on you lazy bastard, get up.

01:07:36.531 --> 01:07:37.364
(she sighs)

01:07:37.364 --> 01:07:40.020
Oh, I don't believe you two.

01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:41.612
- I'm a victim of circumstance.

01:07:41.612 --> 01:07:43.517
(both giggle)

01:07:43.517 --> 01:07:45.059
- Kay, get out of there.

01:07:45.059 --> 01:07:46.726
And you get to work.

01:07:52.867 --> 01:07:55.820
(camera whirring)

01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:57.310
- Is he ready?

01:07:57.310 --> 01:07:58.250
- If he were any looser,

01:07:58.250 --> 01:08:01.100
we'd have to pour him into
the ship with a funnel.

01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:03.255
- How many fingers am I holding up?

01:08:03.255 --> 01:08:04.770
- Eleventeen?

01:08:04.770 --> 01:08:05.833
- God help us.

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:08.653
- This is a camera.

01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:12.640
It'll feed a signal into the ship

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:13.610
and display on your screen

01:08:13.610 --> 01:08:16.288
so you'll have an idea
of what's going outside.

01:08:16.288 --> 01:08:17.680
- What, me?

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:19.660
What makes you think I'm going with him?

01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:21.779
- I'm a Nobel prize winning
theoretical physicist.

01:08:21.779 --> 01:08:24.200
Won the Kernditz Prize and the Precolone

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.529
and named world's smartest dude

01:08:25.529 --> 01:08:27.229
in the last ever issue of "Rolling Stone".

01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:29.093
I'm not entirely stupid.

01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:33.477
Here, good luck to you both.

01:08:33.477 --> 01:08:35.350
- Here, here's some backup

01:08:35.350 --> 01:08:38.040
in case you feel yourself sobering up.

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.210
- Thanks, bro.

01:08:39.210 --> 01:08:40.479
Mwah.

01:08:40.479 --> 01:08:42.796
Come on, kid, let's go save the world.

01:08:43.991 --> 01:08:46.658
(ominous music)

01:08:51.696 --> 01:08:54.410
- Okay, you need to fly
low to avoid detection.

01:08:54.410 --> 01:08:55.761
- I don't wanna.

01:08:55.761 --> 01:08:56.916
(bushes scraping)

01:08:56.916 --> 01:08:57.749
- Not that low.

01:08:57.749 --> 01:08:58.817
Pull up, pull up.

01:08:58.817 --> 01:08:59.885
- You fly this thing?

01:08:59.885 --> 01:09:01.756
Go ahead, take the wheel.

01:09:01.756 --> 01:09:04.089
(ship engines screeching)

01:09:04.089 --> 01:09:06.006
- All right, I'm sorry.

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:07.933
How are you feeling?

01:09:07.933 --> 01:09:09.048
You're not sobering up are you?

01:09:09.048 --> 01:09:09.881
- No.

01:09:11.027 --> 01:09:12.109
- Good, good.

01:09:17.439 --> 01:09:20.291
All right according to this
data that Zayden gave us,

01:09:20.291 --> 01:09:22.310
right over the hill where the river bends

01:09:22.310 --> 01:09:24.060
there should be this kind of open plain

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:26.395
and whatever it is we're looking
for should be right there.

01:09:26.395 --> 01:09:28.670
- All right, Captain.

01:09:28.670 --> 01:09:30.002
Warp factor one.

01:09:30.856 --> 01:09:32.682
(Kay sighs)

01:09:32.682 --> 01:09:35.932
(ship engines roaring)

01:09:39.323 --> 01:09:42.407
(gong reverberating)

01:09:45.939 --> 01:09:48.738
(gears whirring)

01:09:48.738 --> 01:09:51.130
- All right, that must be it.

01:09:51.130 --> 01:09:52.511
What the hell are those things?

01:09:52.511 --> 01:09:53.852
- Sentries.

01:09:53.852 --> 01:09:57.852
Remember what Zayden said,
they're the sentries.

01:10:07.018 --> 01:10:09.390
(metallic scrapping)

01:10:09.390 --> 01:10:10.620
- You need to slow down.

01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:11.470
You're going too fast.

01:10:11.470 --> 01:10:13.306
They don't fly these things so fast.

01:10:13.306 --> 01:10:15.277
- That's 'cause they're pussies.

01:10:15.277 --> 01:10:17.467
- Slow down, you're
attracting too much attention.

01:10:17.467 --> 01:10:18.467
- All right.

01:10:20.998 --> 01:10:23.748
(Blake chuckles)

01:10:34.195 --> 01:10:36.945
(gears whirring)

01:10:44.721 --> 01:10:46.269
- Oh, this isn't good.

01:10:46.269 --> 01:10:48.092
Something's wrong.

01:10:48.092 --> 01:10:50.842
(gears whirring)

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:55.698
- Relax, they'll think
we're one of the gang.

01:10:55.698 --> 01:10:59.223
(gears whirring)

01:10:59.223 --> 01:11:00.071
- No, no they don't.

01:11:00.071 --> 01:11:01.246
We're getting too close.

01:11:01.246 --> 01:11:02.744
- Everything's fine.

01:11:02.744 --> 01:11:05.305
(weapons pulsing)

01:11:05.305 --> 01:11:06.809
Holy shit!

01:11:06.809 --> 01:11:07.642
- Get us out of here.

01:11:07.642 --> 01:11:08.960
Get us out of here.

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:11.793
(weapons pulsing)

01:11:22.025 --> 01:11:25.756
- Ah, damn, those babies mean business.

01:11:25.756 --> 01:11:27.135
- Okay, stop firing.

01:11:27.135 --> 01:11:28.067
I think we're out of range.

01:11:28.067 --> 01:11:29.123
- Incoming.

01:11:29.123 --> 01:11:31.956
(weapons pulsing)

01:11:43.337 --> 01:11:46.156
(explosion booming)

01:11:46.156 --> 01:11:48.263
He-he, piece of cake.

01:11:49.378 --> 01:11:51.250
Those suckers are too easy.

01:11:51.250 --> 01:11:52.693
Okay, round two.

01:11:54.618 --> 01:11:56.442
- We need a plan.

01:11:56.442 --> 01:11:57.350
(Blake sighs)

01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:58.713
- I gotta a plan.

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:06.950
We're gonna book in there,

01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:07.783
kick some alien ass,

01:12:07.783 --> 01:12:09.400
then we're gonna get the hell out.

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:11.540
- That isn't a real plan.

01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:12.690
- Oh, no?

01:12:12.690 --> 01:12:13.607
Watch this.

01:12:14.518 --> 01:12:17.768
(ship engines revving)

01:12:19.439 --> 01:12:20.272
(gears whirring)

01:12:20.272 --> 01:12:23.105
(weapons pulsing)

01:12:26.987 --> 01:12:29.987
(explosion booming)

01:12:35.093 --> 01:12:37.593
- Retreat, get us out of here.

01:12:40.648 --> 01:12:42.707
(electrical crackling)

01:12:42.707 --> 01:12:45.540
(weapons pulsing)

01:12:48.696 --> 01:12:49.833
- We're going down.

01:12:49.833 --> 01:12:50.848
- No, we can't.

01:12:50.848 --> 01:12:52.442
Do something.

01:12:52.442 --> 01:12:53.650
(debris crashing)

01:12:53.650 --> 01:12:56.467
- I don't think I can do this anymore.

01:12:56.467 --> 01:12:57.360
The images is fading.

01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:58.193
I can't see.

01:12:58.193 --> 01:12:59.343
I don't know what's out there.

01:12:59.343 --> 01:13:00.176
- I can see.

01:13:00.176 --> 01:13:01.009
I can for you.

01:13:01.009 --> 01:13:04.870
- Oh, yes, the ship's
getting away from me.

01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:06.946
(Blake sighs)

01:13:06.946 --> 01:13:08.851
- Okay, listen.

01:13:08.851 --> 01:13:09.865
I have a plan.

01:13:09.865 --> 01:13:12.820
I know what we have to do.

01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:14.153
- Let's hear it.

01:13:15.728 --> 01:13:20.550
- We can't outfight them
and we can't outrun them.

01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:24.180
But what we can do is
turn the ship around,

01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:26.240
fly it right back to that tower

01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:29.410
and put this piece of trash right into it.

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:32.040
- We'll be killed.

01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:35.120
- I know, sweetie.

01:13:37.170 --> 01:13:38.590
But it's what we have to do.

01:13:40.972 --> 01:13:43.139
- You wanna play kamikaze.

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:47.610
I can be a freaking kamikaze.

01:13:47.610 --> 01:13:48.893
Which way do I go?

01:13:50.424 --> 01:13:51.400
- 180.

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:52.421
(Blake chuckles)

01:13:52.421 --> 01:13:53.981
- [Blake] Yee-haw.

01:13:53.981 --> 01:13:56.248
- Okay a little to the left.

01:13:56.248 --> 01:13:57.462
A little more.

01:13:57.462 --> 01:14:01.939
Oh, not so much.

01:14:01.939 --> 01:14:03.356
Okay, stay, stay.

01:14:04.372 --> 01:14:05.267
Okay, you're doing good.

01:14:05.267 --> 01:14:06.100
You're doing great.

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:08.473
We're almost there.

01:14:08.473 --> 01:14:09.726
Pull up a little.

01:14:09.726 --> 01:14:10.578
Pull up.

01:14:10.578 --> 01:14:13.411
(weapons pulsing)

01:14:14.479 --> 01:14:17.396
Bank right, hard right, hard right!

01:14:18.972 --> 01:14:21.972
(explosion booming)

01:14:24.864 --> 01:14:27.697
(metal crunching)

01:14:29.972 --> 01:14:32.639
(ominous music)

01:14:40.197 --> 01:14:41.750
Hey, wake up, get up.

01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:42.583
Up-up-up.

01:14:46.894 --> 01:14:49.394
(Blake moans)

01:14:54.678 --> 01:14:57.345
(image whining)

01:15:04.497 --> 01:15:06.080
Hey, what'd you do?

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:08.900
What, what did you say?

01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:11.300
(Blake whispering)

01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:14.117
Self destruct, is that,
is that what you said?

01:15:14.117 --> 01:15:16.603
Well, let's get the hell out of here.

01:15:17.556 --> 01:15:18.704
Come on.

01:15:18.704 --> 01:15:20.652
(she groans)

01:15:20.652 --> 01:15:23.402
(metal scraping)

01:15:26.381 --> 01:15:28.881
(Kay screams)

01:15:32.428 --> 01:15:33.261
- Grab my hand.

01:15:36.604 --> 01:15:38.836
(Blake yells)

01:15:38.836 --> 01:15:41.919
(gong reverberating)

01:15:53.315 --> 01:15:56.148
(weapons pulsing)

01:16:02.763 --> 01:16:05.513
(gears whirring)

01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:14.960
- Baby, I know what we should do.

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:15.903
- [Blake] What's that?

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:18.847
- On the count of three.

01:16:18.847 --> 01:16:19.680
- Uh-huh.

01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:21.613
- Let go.

01:16:21.613 --> 01:16:22.446
- [Blake] What?

01:16:24.845 --> 01:16:25.780
- We can't hold on.

01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:28.620
Let's, let's go together, ready?

01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:29.453
- [Blake] No.

01:16:29.453 --> 01:16:30.286
- One.

01:16:30.286 --> 01:16:31.119
- Kay!
- Two.

01:16:31.119 --> 01:16:31.952
- Kay, don't!

01:16:31.952 --> 01:16:32.785
- Three.

01:16:32.785 --> 01:16:33.864
- [Blake] Kay!

01:16:37.330 --> 01:16:40.080
(wind whistling)

01:16:42.023 --> 01:16:44.773
(ground quaking)

01:16:51.268 --> 01:16:54.101
(weapons pulsing)

01:17:00.438 --> 01:17:02.938
(Alex growls)

01:17:04.033 --> 01:17:07.033
(explosion booming)

01:17:08.556 --> 01:17:10.378
(metal scraping)

01:17:10.378 --> 01:17:11.472
(Blake yells)

01:17:11.472 --> 01:17:12.488
- Blake!

01:17:12.488 --> 01:17:13.571
- [Blake] No!

01:17:18.531 --> 01:17:21.630
(electrical crackling)

01:17:21.630 --> 01:17:22.590
- Alex, the tower's gonna blow.

01:17:22.590 --> 01:17:24.350
You gotta get us out of here.

01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:25.750
Like how much time do we have?

01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:26.583
- I don't know.

01:17:26.583 --> 01:17:27.740
Not much.

01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:30.990
(electrical crackling)

01:17:36.046 --> 01:17:38.879
(weapons pulsing)

01:17:46.853 --> 01:17:49.270
(Alex howls)

01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:11.118
(explosion roaring)

01:18:11.118 --> 01:18:13.701
(wind howling)

01:18:30.629 --> 01:18:33.712
(gong reverberating)

01:18:46.330 --> 01:18:47.163
- Look.

01:18:50.466 --> 01:18:53.552
(body fizzing)

01:18:53.552 --> 01:18:55.451
I mean, Jayden was right.

01:18:55.451 --> 01:18:56.284
We've won.

01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:07.880
- God, that's one powerful son of a bitch.

01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:15.277
(Alex roars)

01:19:15.277 --> 01:19:16.640
Look like you got yourself a new king.

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:19.831
- Eh, I guess that makes
me the princess royal.

01:19:19.831 --> 01:19:22.720
(both laugh)

01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:25.843
- We won the battle but not the war.

01:19:25.843 --> 01:19:27.493
And only a local battle, at that.

01:19:28.813 --> 01:19:31.013
Things'll get harder
before they get easier.

01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:32.993
We stung them.

01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:35.490
But they'll be on their guard.

01:19:36.710 --> 01:19:39.403
Still, it's a start.

01:19:40.819 --> 01:19:41.869
- And what about him?

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:43.673
- I don't know.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.190
He may be their biggest blunder.

01:19:48.190 --> 01:19:51.470
From what you tell me they
may have created an enemy

01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:55.753
so powerful even the aliens
are helpless against him.

01:19:57.140 --> 01:19:59.130
- You think there are more like him?

01:19:59.130 --> 01:19:59.963
- Could be.

01:20:01.410 --> 01:20:02.243
It's possible.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:09.000
My god, can you imagine
an army of those things.

01:20:09.390 --> 01:20:11.903
They'd be undefeatable.

01:20:13.890 --> 01:20:15.323
- That thing has a name.

01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:20.653

01:20:25.230 --> 01:20:26.890

01:20:26.890 --> 01:20:28.740

01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:31.010

01:20:55.386 --> 01:20:58.053
(ominous music)
