WEBVTT

00:10.144 --> 00:12.513
- * ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR
FIVE, SIX *

00:12.546 --> 00:13.647
* SHAKE IT, DUDE

00:13.681 --> 00:21.589
*

00:35.436 --> 00:37.438
- * CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:46.247 --> 00:49.717
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:49.750 --> 00:53.554
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:53.587 --> 00:56.524
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:59.593 --> 01:01.729
- HEY, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO WITH THESE?

01:01.762 --> 01:04.732
[indistinct chatter]

01:07.135 --> 01:08.736
- OKAY, I'LL TAKE THESE
TO THE WAREHOUSE.

01:08.769 --> 01:10.738
I'LL BE BACK IN AN HOUR.

01:10.771 --> 01:13.441
- WAIT, WAIT.
GRAB THESE.

01:13.474 --> 01:16.544
- WE HAVE TO BE OUT OF HERE
BY THE END OF THE DAY.

01:36.630 --> 01:39.233
[chatter continues]

01:50.178 --> 01:52.580
- HEY, WHAT ABOUT
THESE LIFE-SIZED CUTOUTS?

01:54.515 --> 01:56.350
- IT ALL SEEMS TO BE
COMING TOGETHER--

01:56.384 --> 01:58.219
NO GLITCHES
THAT I CAN FORESEE.

01:58.252 --> 01:59.620
EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.222
NEW LEASE
HAS BEEN SIGNED,

02:01.255 --> 02:02.490
THE LIQUOR LICENSE
HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED

02:02.523 --> 02:03.891
INTO THE NAME
OF KINNETIKORP.

02:03.924 --> 02:05.893
YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH INSURANCE
THAT IF SOMEONE

02:05.926 --> 02:07.695
SO AS MUCH SNEEZES,
YOU'RE PROTECTED.

02:07.728 --> 02:10.764
IN SHORT,
THE JOINT'S ALL YOURS.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.234
- THEODORE, YOU ARE A MARVEL.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.169
- ALTHOUGH WHEN I SAID,
"GO BUY YOURSELF A NEW TOY,"

02:15.203 --> 02:16.904
THIS ISN'T EXACTLY THE TOY
I HAD IN MIND.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.372
- HEY, IT SAYS ON THE BOX

02:18.406 --> 02:20.641
"APPROPRIATE FOR BOYS
AGES 19 TO 30,"

02:20.674 --> 02:23.611
SO STOP FRETTING, MOTHER,
I CAN AFFORD IT.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.515
- ARE YOU SURE WE
CAN AFFORD IT?

02:27.548 --> 02:29.550
- WE DID THE MATH
A DOZEN TIMES.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.785
EVEN WITHOUT THE MOVIE,
WE EACH HAVE ENOUGH INCOME,

02:31.819 --> 02:34.255
PLUS THE MONEY WE'VE SAVED.

02:34.288 --> 02:35.923
- I JUST NEED
SOME REASSURANCE.

02:35.956 --> 02:38.659
- OH.

02:38.692 --> 02:41.395
MMM, HOW'S THAT?

02:41.429 --> 02:43.531
- I'M ALREADY THINKING
COLOR SCHEME.

02:43.564 --> 02:45.533
- OOH.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.835
- ALL THE BACK ROOM NEEDS
IS A FRESH COAT OF BLACK PAINT

02:47.868 --> 02:49.803
AND A CONDOM DISPENSER.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.973
- WHAT ABOUT PINK WALLS
WITH A SKY-BLUE CEILING

02:53.006 --> 02:55.543
AND WHITE, FLUFFY CLOUDS
FOR THE BABY'S ROOM?

02:55.576 --> 02:57.278
- YEAH, IT'S AMAZING
HOW WITH A FEW SIMPLE TOUCHES,

02:57.311 --> 02:58.679
YOU CAN TURN
A TIRED OLD ROOM

02:58.712 --> 03:00.514
INTO A FRESH
AND INVITING SPACE.

03:00.548 --> 03:02.316
- OR WE COULD WALLPAPER.

03:02.350 --> 03:04.418
REMEMBER HOW MONTY AND ELI
HAD THEIR KIDS' ROOM WALLPAPERED

03:04.452 --> 03:05.853
WITH DISNEY CHARACTERS?

03:05.886 --> 03:07.555
- AND, UH, GET
A CLEANING CREW IN HERE

03:07.588 --> 03:10.691
TO JACKHAMMER
THE DRIED CUM OFF THE FLOOR.

03:10.724 --> 03:13.294
- HALF OF IT'S PROBABLY YOURS.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.229
- WITH ALL THIS SPACE,

03:15.263 --> 03:16.764
AT LEAST WE WON'T BE
ON TOP OF EACH OTHER.

03:16.797 --> 03:19.967
- YEAH,
UNLESS WE CHOOSE TO BE.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.304
- I WANT TO REOPEN BY FRIDAY.
- FRIDAY?

03:23.337 --> 03:25.239
THIS FRIDAY?
BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

03:25.273 --> 03:26.707
- WELL, YOU SAID EVERY DAY

03:26.740 --> 03:28.476
THAT WE'RE CLOSED,
WE'RE LOSING MONEY.

03:28.509 --> 03:29.877
- YEAH, BUT WE STILL NEED TO
LINE UP BARTENDERS, GO-GO BOYS,

03:29.910 --> 03:31.312
A NEW MANAGER...

03:31.345 --> 03:32.446
WELL, THEN YOU
BETTER LINE THEM UP.

03:32.480 --> 03:33.781
- BUT--

03:33.814 --> 03:36.584
- THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO.

03:36.617 --> 03:39.320
- THEY SAY IT TOOK 500 YEARS
TO COMPLETE NOTRE DAME.

03:39.353 --> 03:42.323
- [chuckles] IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO BE ENCOURAGING?

03:42.356 --> 03:44.792
- WE'RE MAKING A HOME,
TOGETHER.

03:44.825 --> 03:48.896
WHO CARES
HOW LONG IT TAKES?

03:48.929 --> 03:50.464
- WELL, I-IF THERE'S A PROBLEM,

03:50.498 --> 03:52.466
WE'LL JUST CHANGE
THE TABLECLOTHS...

03:52.500 --> 03:54.602
AND THE NAPKINS...

03:54.635 --> 03:57.338
AND THE FLOWERS...

03:57.371 --> 03:58.906
AND THE MENU.

03:58.939 --> 04:01.342
LET ME KNOW IF YOU WANT
TO CHANGE THE GROOM.

04:01.375 --> 04:04.812
[laughs]
OKAY.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.547
- WHO WAS THAT?

04:06.580 --> 04:09.350
- UGH. THE WEDDING
OF ALIEN AND PREDATOR.

04:09.383 --> 04:12.019
THE GROOM'S THE PRODUCER
OF THE CHANNEL 5 6:00 NEWS.

04:12.052 --> 04:14.622
BELIEVE ME, IT'LL BE
BIG NEWS IF I SURVIVE.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.290
THE BRIDE IS
A TWICE-DIVORCED DRAMA QUEEN,

04:16.324 --> 04:17.758
PANZER DIVISION,

04:17.791 --> 04:19.693
WHO'S CONVINCED
THERE'S GOING TO BE A DISASTER.

04:19.727 --> 04:22.029
AND, BELIEVE ME, IF SHE
DOESN'T GET OFF MY ASS,

04:22.062 --> 04:24.632
WHICH ARE WORDS YOU RARELY HEAR
ME SAY, THERE MAY BE.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.300
- WELL, CAN'T BE WORSE

04:26.334 --> 04:27.768
THAN MEL AND LINDSAY'S
ANNIVERSARY SURPRISE.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.637
- YEAH, NO SHIT.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.305
- YEAH, NOW, HONEY, YOU CAN'T
LET YOURSELF GET ALL WORKED UP.

04:31.339 --> 04:32.906
- I TOLD YOU TO KEEP
YOUR FUCKING PANTS ON.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.042
I'LL TAKE YOUR ORDER
AS SOON AS I CAN.

04:35.075 --> 04:37.378
- OF COURSE, I REALIZE THAT
MAY BE GENETICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.780
OKAY, BOYS, BACON CHEESEBURGER
FOR MICHAEL,

04:39.813 --> 04:41.582
POT PIE FOR EM...
- THANKS.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.917
- AND A B.L.T. FOR TEDDY--

04:43.951 --> 04:47.287
HOLD THE BACON, LETTUCE,
BREAD, MAYO, AND FRIES.

04:49.457 --> 04:52.059
- YOU TRYING TO KEEP YOURSELF
IN SHAPE FOR YOUR NEW BOYFRIEND?

04:52.092 --> 04:53.594
- HE'S ADORABLE.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.663
- YEAH. HE'S HISTORY.

04:55.696 --> 05:00.668
HE JACKS OFF TO PHOTOS
OF TED KENNEDY.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.403
HE ACTUALLY THOUGHT
MARLON BRANDO

05:02.436 --> 05:05.072
NEEDED TO GAIN A FEW POUNDS.

05:05.105 --> 05:06.674
THAT'S WHY HE WAS
IN LOVE WITH ME--

05:06.707 --> 05:08.442
FAT AND OLD TURN HIM ON.

05:08.476 --> 05:10.978
- TEDDY, YOU'RE NOT FAT...

05:11.011 --> 05:13.080
WELL, NOT HUGELY-GROSSLY.

05:13.113 --> 05:15.683
- AND YOU'RE
CERTAINLY NOT OLD.

05:15.716 --> 05:17.017
- EXCUSE ME, SIR?

05:17.050 --> 05:19.553
SIR!

05:19.587 --> 05:22.890
BABYLON REOPENS FRIDAY NIGHT.

05:22.923 --> 05:26.827
HERE YOU GO, GUYS.
CHECK IT OUT.

05:26.860 --> 05:30.431
- HE CALLED ME "SIR."

05:30.464 --> 05:33.734
HE SPOKE LOUDLY
SO I COULD HEAR.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.736
- I THOUGHT BABYLON
WENT BELLY UP.

05:35.769 --> 05:38.372
- YOU MEAN YOU DIDN'T KNOW?
TELL HIM, TEDDY.

05:38.406 --> 05:40.441
- I RESUSCITATED IT.

05:40.474 --> 05:43.644
PUT MY MOUTH ON IT AND BLEW.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.979
- SO THAT'S HOW YOU SPENT
YOUR DISPOSABLE INCOME?

05:46.013 --> 05:48.582
[scoffs]
YOU SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT A HOUSE.

05:48.616 --> 05:51.051
- SOME OF US QUEERS PREFER
DANCING AND FUCKING

05:51.084 --> 05:52.853
TO KIDDIES
AND PICKET FENCES.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.456
- WORD ON THE STREET IS THAT
POPPERZ IS THE NEW HOT SPOT.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.391
- FRIDAY NIGHT POPPERZ GOES BACK

05:57.425 --> 05:58.992
TO BEING THE PISS-HOLE
IT ALWAYS WAS.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.595
- BABYLON REOPENS FRIDAY NIGHT.
CHECK IT OUT.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.464
HERE YOU GO, GUYS,
CHECK IT OUT.

06:03.497 --> 06:06.366
BABYLON REOPENS FRIDAY NIGHT.
- CHECK IT OUT.

06:08.502 --> 06:09.637
- [playful voice]
HI, J.R.

06:09.670 --> 06:12.506
YOUR DADDY LOVES YOU.

06:12.540 --> 06:13.807
- THERE'S THIS NEW PLACE
IN THE MALL.

06:13.841 --> 06:15.476
YOU DESIGN
THE BEARS YOURSELF

06:15.509 --> 06:17.778
AND PICK OUT THEIR OUTFITS,
RECORD THEIR VOICES.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.146
- IT'S ADORABLE.

06:19.179 --> 06:21.749
- PRECIOUS.

06:21.782 --> 06:23.016
- YOU'LL HAVE TO
FORGIVE MELANIE.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.618
SHE'S BEEN UP ALL
NIGHT WITH J.R.

06:24.652 --> 06:26.019
- UH, SHE HAS COLIC.

06:26.053 --> 06:29.490
CRIED FOR FOUR
HOURS STRAIGHT.

06:29.523 --> 06:30.558
- [clears throat]

06:30.591 --> 06:32.159
LOOK, I WANTED
TO APOLOGIZE

06:32.192 --> 06:34.962
FOR GETTING SO HEATED
THE OTHER NIGHT.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.564
IT WAS A SHOCK,
THAT'S ALL.

06:36.597 --> 06:37.965
I WASN'T EXPECTING--
- WE KNOW.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.700
NO ONE WAS.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.503
- ALTHOUGH NOW
THAT I REMEMBER,

06:42.536 --> 06:44.438
EVERY TIME
I WOULD STOP BY,

06:44.472 --> 06:47.675
ONE OF YOU WAS ALWAYS OUT
OR AT WORK OR TAKING A NAP.

06:49.577 --> 06:50.711
ANYWAY, I'M SORRY.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.045
- YOU SAID THAT.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.647
- I MEAN, THAT AFTER
ALL THIS TIME,

06:53.681 --> 06:55.115
YOU TWO COULDN'T WORK
THINGS OUT,

06:55.148 --> 06:56.784
THAT IT HAD TO COME TO THIS.
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.452
WE'RE SORRY TOO.
NOW, IF YOU DON'T MIND,

06:58.486 --> 07:00.521
COULD WE NOT DISCUSS
OUR MARITAL PROBLEMS?

07:00.554 --> 07:02.055
- THE IMPORTANT THING IS,

07:02.089 --> 07:05.192
WE NEED TO DECIDE HOW WE'RE
GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR CHILD.

07:05.225 --> 07:07.595
- OUR CHILD?

07:07.628 --> 07:09.963
- HOW MUCH TIME SHE'LL SPEND
WITH YOU AND WITH LINZ

07:09.997 --> 07:11.131
AND BEN AND ME.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.801
WE'RE BUYING A NEW HOUSE.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.836
- I'LL TELL YOU HOW MUCH TIME
SHE'S GOING TO SPEND WITH YOU--

07:15.869 --> 07:17.471
NONE!
[baby cries]

07:17.505 --> 07:18.972
- MELANIE, PLEASE,
WOULD YOU LOWER YOUR VOICE?

07:19.006 --> 07:21.008
I'M SURE WE CAN HANDLE THIS
WITHOUT SCREAMING.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.810
- WHO'S SCREAMING?
I'M MAKING A POINT.

07:22.843 --> 07:25.145
- TELL THAT TO HER.

07:25.178 --> 07:27.080
- WE HAD AN AGREEMENT--

07:27.114 --> 07:28.949
THAT I'D BE A PART
OF OUR DAUGHTER'S LIFE.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.684
- YEAH, WHICH AT NO TIME
INCLUDED PHYSICAL CUSTODY.

07:30.718 --> 07:32.119
THAT WAS NEVER DISCUSSED.

07:32.152 --> 07:33.954
- BECAUSE WHEN WE MADE IT,
YOU TWO WERE TOGETHER--

07:33.987 --> 07:36.223
A COUPLE, A FAMILY.

07:36.256 --> 07:38.025
NOW ALL THAT'S CHANGED.
NOW YOU'RE NOT.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.093
- WHY? I'M STILL HER MOTHER.
- SO AM I.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.829
- AND I'M HER FATHER.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.030
- NO ONE'S DENYING THAT.
- SHE IS.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.598
SHE'S SAYING I HAVE NO RIGHTS.

07:44.632 --> 07:46.567
- NO, I'M SAYING YOU
MAY BE HER FATHER,

07:46.600 --> 07:48.168
HER BIOLOGICAL FATHER,

07:48.201 --> 07:49.837
BUT LINDSAY AND I ARE
STILL HER PARENTS.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.873
THAT HASN'T CHANGED.

07:56.610 --> 08:00.814
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
MY DAUGHTER NEEDS TO BE FED.

08:04.317 --> 08:07.655
- ALL RIGHT, UPON ARRIVAL, THE
GUESTS WILL BE OFFERED A GLASS

08:07.688 --> 08:10.524
OF CHATEAUNEUF-DU-PAPE, 1991.
- MAKE THAT 1990.

08:10.558 --> 08:12.259
- UH, 1990,

08:12.292 --> 08:13.994
WHILE A STRING QUARTET

08:14.027 --> 08:15.996
PLAYS A MEDLEY OF YOUR FAVORITE
ELTON JOHN SONGS.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.666
- I'VE DECIDED TO GO
WITH EINE KLEINE NACHTMUSIK.

08:18.699 --> 08:21.268
- AH, WELL, SCRATCH
ROCKET MAN.

08:21.301 --> 08:24.037
NOW, UH, WHEN
THE WEDDING MARCH BEGINS--

08:24.071 --> 08:26.306
WE ARE KEEPING
THE WEDDING MARCH?

08:26.339 --> 08:27.741
OH, OF COURSE, UH...

08:27.775 --> 08:29.877
YOU'LL ENTER FROM,
UH, OVER THERE.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.745
UM...
- WHY NOT OVER HERE?

08:31.779 --> 08:34.882
- YOU'LL ENTER FROM OVER HERE
HOLDING A SPRAY OF LILIES.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.917
- I'M THINKING NOW OF
WHITE ROSES AND BABY'S BREATH.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.919
- BABY'S BREATH.
OKAY.

08:38.952 --> 08:41.154
UH, YOU'LL THEN PROCEED
TO THE BOWER.

08:41.188 --> 08:44.057
UM, AT WHICH POINT--
- WHAT IF IT RAINS?

08:44.091 --> 08:46.560
- I ALREADY ASKED JOHNNY--
NO RAIN.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.662
- YOUR WEATHERMAN
COULDN'T PREDICT A HURRICANE

08:48.696 --> 08:51.765
IF IT WAS BLOWING
DOWN MARKET STREET.

08:51.799 --> 08:53.300
- I'VE GOT TO GET
BACK TO THE STATION.

08:53.333 --> 08:54.902
I GOT A REMOTE COMING IN
FROM IRAQ.

08:54.935 --> 08:57.337
- IRAQ?

08:57.370 --> 09:00.874
SCREW IRAQ!
WE'RE HAVING A WEDDING!

09:00.908 --> 09:03.076
- NOW, NOW,
UH, DON'T YOU WORRY.

09:03.110 --> 09:05.045
I AM GOING TO HAVE
A LITTLE TALK WITH GOD.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.814
AND THERE IS NO WAY
HE'S GOING TO LET ANYTHING

09:06.847 --> 09:08.982
RAIN ON YOUR PARADE.

09:09.016 --> 09:11.919
- [chuckles, gasps]
THE LADIES' ROOM--

09:11.952 --> 09:14.788
WE HAVEN'T DECIDED THE COLOR
OF THE TOILET TISSUE.

09:14.822 --> 09:17.057
LAVENDER.
UM, NO. MINT.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.926
UH, NO.
UH, BUTTERCUP.

09:18.959 --> 09:23.063
- I WISH YOU COULD SEE LILA
UNDER LESS STRESSFUL CONDITIONS.

09:23.096 --> 09:26.366
SHE'D STILL DRIVE YOU NUTS,
BUT I LOVE HER.

09:26.399 --> 09:29.102
- WELL, OF COURSE YOU DO.
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.071
- YOU KNOW, I GOT
TO HAND IT TO YOU.

09:31.104 --> 09:33.874
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT.
- WELL...

09:33.907 --> 09:36.209
ONE OF THE REASONS
WE QUEER GUYS ARE AROUND--

09:36.243 --> 09:38.812
HELP YOU POOR STRAIGHT PEOPLE
STRAIGHTEN UP.

09:38.846 --> 09:41.682
[chuckles]

09:41.715 --> 09:44.084
- JOSEPH, MAKE SURE YOU PACK
MY SWIMSUITS AND T-SHIRTS, HUH?

09:44.117 --> 09:46.687
IT'S SUMMER IN AUSTRALIA.
- YES, SIR.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.990
- ANYWAY, THEY FIRED HIM,
THREE DAYS INTO PRODUCTION.

09:50.023 --> 09:51.725
FIRST-TIME DIRECTOR,
HUGE PRODUCTION--

09:51.759 --> 09:53.226
HE COULDN'T HANDLE IT.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.395
ALSO, I HEAR HE AND
ORLANDO BLOOM DID NOT GET ALONG.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.897
OH, BLAIR?
- YES, BRETT.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.298
- I WANT THAT TRAINER

09:58.331 --> 10:00.033
AT MY HOTEL EVERY MORNING
AT 5:00 A.M., HUH?

10:00.067 --> 10:01.702
- THEY'RE STILL
NEGOTIATING THAT.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.737
- WELL, CALL THE PRODUCER
AND FUCKING DEMAND IT!

10:03.771 --> 10:05.873
- YOU GOT IT, BRETT.
- HOW LONG WILL YOU BE GONE?

10:05.906 --> 10:08.275
- WELL, IT'S A SIX-MONTH SHOOT,
PROVIDED I CAN DO POST HERE.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.743
YOU KNOW, WE'RE
STILL NEGOTIATING.

10:09.777 --> 10:12.245
WHERE THE HELL
IS MY AMBIEN? AH.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.281
ON AN 18-HOUR FLIGHT,
IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO FLY.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.116
- I'M SURE.

10:16.149 --> 10:18.118
- LISTEN, I DON'T MEAN
TO THROW YOU OUT OR ANYTHING,

10:18.151 --> 10:19.319
BUT I JUST FIGURED
WHILE I WAS GONE,

10:19.352 --> 10:21.054
IT WOULD BE A GOOD TIME

10:21.088 --> 10:22.756
TO DO SOME WORK ON THE HOUSE,
YOU KNOW, REDECORATE.

10:22.790 --> 10:25.158
BUT PLEASE FEEL FREE TO STAY
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS

10:25.192 --> 10:27.895
UNTIL YOU LINE UP
SOMETHING ELSE.

10:27.928 --> 10:30.130
- THANKS.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.732
- EVEN THOUGH I'M
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD,

10:31.765 --> 10:33.734
I HAVEN'T LOST
MY PASSION FOR RAGE.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.336
MY DEVELOPMENT PEOPLE
ARE GOING TO SHOP IT AROUND.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.271
THE GAY CRUSADER
IS TOO POWERFUL

10:38.305 --> 10:40.307
TO BE DEFEATED
BY SOME ASSHOLE

10:40.340 --> 10:42.142
WHO CAN'T SEE
BEYOND THE BOX OFFICE.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.678
RIGHT?
- MM-HMM.

10:47.915 --> 10:49.883
- BLAIR.
- YES, BRETT.

10:49.917 --> 10:52.686
- I'M NOT HAPPY WITH THE TIME
WE'VE ARRANGED FOR THE CAR...

10:52.720 --> 10:54.788
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THE WAY SHE TALKED TO ME.

10:54.822 --> 10:57.057
- YOU'RE THE FATHER.
- BUT I'M NOT THE PARENT--

10:57.090 --> 10:58.926
AT LEAST NOT AS FAR
AS MELANIE'S CONCERNED.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.327
- OH, THAT'S BULLSHIT.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.062
YOU'RE EVERY BIT
AS MUCH A PARENT AS SHE IS.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.430
- YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD HER,

11:03.463 --> 11:05.165
SCREAMING SO LOUD,
SHE WOKE UP THE BABY.

11:05.198 --> 11:08.902
- [chuckles]
- WITH ALL THEIR CARRYING ON...

11:08.936 --> 11:10.203
I KNOW WE CAN PROVIDE

11:10.237 --> 11:12.773
A MORE STABLE HOME LIFE
FOR J.R. THAN THEY CAN.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.374
- YEAH, I'M SURE YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.910
BUT THE ONE THING WE MUSTN'T DO
IS OVERREACT.

11:16.944 --> 11:19.046
WE'VE GOT TO STAY CALM
AND RATIONAL.

11:19.079 --> 11:22.215
- EVERYBODY
KEEPS TELLING ME THAT!

11:24.818 --> 11:26.186
ALL RIGHT, I'LL BE CALM...

11:26.219 --> 11:29.389
AND RATIONAL, BUT...

11:29.422 --> 11:31.925
THERE'S NO WAY
I'M GIVING UP MY KID.

11:31.959 --> 11:34.327
[tape rips loudly]

11:34.361 --> 11:36.930
- FINISH UP WITH THOSE LIGHTS.
WE'RE ABOUT TO OPEN THE DOORS.

11:36.964 --> 11:38.799
COULD YOU MOVE THOSE
CARTONS BEHIND THE BAR?

11:38.832 --> 11:40.868
- YES, SIR.
- AND DON'T CALL ME "SIR."

11:40.901 --> 11:45.105
- OKAY, THAT LOOKS GOOD.
- BREAK A LEG, BABY!

11:45.138 --> 11:46.874
JUST HOPEFULLY, NOT WHILE
WE'RE SHAKING OUR BOOTIES.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.809
- EM, I DIDN'T THINK
I'D SEE YOU HERE.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.510
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE TOO BUSY
WITH THE WEDDING PLANS.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.413
- OH, I'M NEVER TOO BUSY TO SIT
RINGSIDE ON OPENING NIGHT.

11:53.446 --> 11:56.149
- READY IN TWO MINUTES.
- OKAY.

11:56.183 --> 11:58.418
- AND, UM, WHO HAVE WE HERE?
- OH, UH...

11:58.451 --> 12:00.788
THIS IS ALONZO.
THIS IS EMMETT.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.255
- I'M ALREADY PICTURING
A MOONLIT BEACH

12:02.289 --> 12:04.157
CARESSED
BY A CARIBBEAN BREEZE,

12:04.191 --> 12:06.960
WHILE THE PALMS SWAY GENTLY
TO A LATIN GUITAR.

12:06.994 --> 12:10.297
- WE DIDN'T HAVE TOO MANY PALM
TREES IN TRENTON.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.132
- ALONZO'S
THE NEW CLUB MANAGER.

12:12.165 --> 12:16.837
- AND MAY I SAY, A VAST
IMPROVEMENT OVER THE FORMER ONE.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.872
- I HAVEN'T HAD THIS MUCH FUN
WITH A TOY

12:18.906 --> 12:21.008
SINCE MY ERECTOR SET.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.976
- MY PARENTS COULDN'T AFFORD
AN ERECTOR SET,

12:23.010 --> 12:24.511
SO I JUST HAD TO PLAY
WITH THE ONE GOD GAVE ME.

12:24.544 --> 12:26.046
[both chuckle]

12:26.079 --> 12:29.516
- OKAY, BOYS,
TAKE YOUR PLACES!

12:29.549 --> 12:32.119
LET'S BRING
THE LIGHTS DOWN

12:32.152 --> 12:35.055
AND THE STROBES UP.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.857
- AND WE'RE BACK IN BUSINESS.

12:36.890 --> 12:39.292
- NOT QUITE.

12:39.326 --> 12:40.861
[electronic music plays loudly]

12:40.894 --> 12:42.329
IT AIN'T BABYLON
WITHOUT THAT...

12:42.362 --> 12:44.131
- THUMPA-THUMPA!

12:44.164 --> 12:47.134
- OKAY, BOYS AND BOYS,
WHAT TIME IS IT?

12:47.167 --> 12:51.138
all:
IT'S SHOWTIME!

12:51.171 --> 12:59.212
*

13:12.059 --> 13:15.128
[indistinct chatter]

13:28.375 --> 13:32.245
- WHAT THE FUCK?

13:32.279 --> 13:35.849
- DON'T WORRY.
IT'S STILL--IT'S EARLY.

13:43.256 --> 13:44.858
- WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

13:44.892 --> 13:46.994
- IT'S SHORTS-AND-SHOTS NIGHT
AT POPPERZ.

13:47.027 --> 13:49.529
ALL THE HOT GUYS
ARE OVER THERE.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.631
I THINK I'LL GO,
UM, CHECK IT OUT.

13:51.664 --> 13:58.105
*

13:58.138 --> 14:01.408
[indistinct chatter,
funky music plays]

14:01.441 --> 14:09.382
*

14:15.455 --> 14:17.557
- CON!

14:17.590 --> 14:19.292
- HEY!

14:19.326 --> 14:22.262
- I DIDN'T THINK YOU
WERE STILL IN TOWN.

14:22.295 --> 14:25.298
THIS IS JUSTIN.
AND SO IS THIS.

14:25.332 --> 14:28.635
- SEEMS THERE'S NO SHORTAGE
OF US IN HOLLYWOOD.

14:28.668 --> 14:31.404
- WOULD YOU GET ME
ANOTHER KETEL ONE?

14:35.008 --> 14:37.911
- HE'S CUTE.
- IF YOU LIKE THE TYPE.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.015
REALLY SUCKS ABOUT RAGE,
DOESN'T IT?

14:42.049 --> 14:43.984
- YEAH. IT REALLY SUCKS.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.986
- I SWEAR, THERE'S NOT AN OUNCE
OF ARTISTIC INTEGRITY

14:46.019 --> 14:47.420
IN THIS FUCKING TOWN.

14:47.454 --> 14:50.523
- WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK
TO NEW YORK--DO THEATER?

14:50.557 --> 14:52.993
- I WOULD IN A HEARTBEAT IF I
DIDN'T HAVE A THREE-PICTURE DEAL

14:53.026 --> 14:55.295
WITH BRUCKHEIMER.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.197
SO WHERE'S
OUR GENIUS DIRECTOR?

14:57.230 --> 15:00.200
- HE LEFT YESTERDAY
FOR AUSTRALIA.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.569
- I HEARD HE'S TAKING OVER
THAT REMAKE OF MOTHRA.

15:02.602 --> 15:05.172
WELL, IT ISN'T A BRETT KELLER
FILM UNLESS SOMETHING FLIES.

15:05.205 --> 15:08.008
- HE STILL PLANS
ON DOING RAGE, THOUGH.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.043
HIS PEOPLE ARE OUT SHOPPING IT
TO OTHER STUDIOS

15:10.077 --> 15:12.012
NOW THAT IT'S IN TURNABOUT.

15:12.045 --> 15:15.015
- [chuckles]
THAT'S "TURNAROUND."

15:15.048 --> 15:17.717
- RIGHT. HE SWORE
HE'S GOING TO GET IT MADE.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.319
- WELL, THAT'S OUR BRETTSKI--

15:19.352 --> 15:21.488
FIGHTING THE EVIL EMPIRE
SINGLE-HANDED.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.690
BUT IN THIS BUSINESS,

15:23.723 --> 15:26.359
THE ONLY THING THAT RISES
FROM THE DEAD IS DRACULA.

15:26.393 --> 15:30.097
AND THEN ONLY IF BRAD PITT
IS PLAYING HIM.

15:30.130 --> 15:33.166
WHEN SOMETHING'S OVER,
IT'S OVER.

15:33.200 --> 15:41.141
*

15:58.425 --> 16:00.627
- YOU LOOK LIKE YOU GAVE AN ORGY
AND NOBODY CAME.

16:00.660 --> 16:04.097
- I LOVE HOW YOU CAN TAKE A
STALE CLICHE AND MAKE IT FRESH.

16:06.133 --> 16:08.735
COULD YOU DO THE SAME
FOR THIS MUFFIN?

16:08.768 --> 16:11.004
- WHAT THE FUCK'S
WITH YOU?

16:11.038 --> 16:12.739
- GUESS HOW MANY HOMOS
SHOWED UP LAST NIGHT

16:12.772 --> 16:15.608
FOR THE REOPENING
OF BABYLON?

16:15.642 --> 16:18.145
- IS THIS ONE
OF THOSE LIGHTBULB JOKES?

16:18.178 --> 16:19.479
- 12.

16:19.512 --> 16:22.549
COUNT THEM. 12.

16:22.582 --> 16:26.153
8 FUCKING GRAND
DOWN THE CRAPPER.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.620
IF I DON'T DO SOMETHING QUICK,

16:27.654 --> 16:29.756
IT'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER
8 FUCKING GRAND TONIGHT

16:29.789 --> 16:32.559
AND TOMORROW NIGHT
AND THE NEXT NIGHT.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.794
- SOUNDS LIKE ONE HELL
OF AN EXPENSIVE BLOW JOB.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.764
- YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T HAVE
MINDED EVEN THAT,

16:37.797 --> 16:39.699
BUT NOT ONE OF THEM
WAS EVEN REMOTELY FUCKABLE.

16:39.732 --> 16:42.135
WELL, I DON'T GET IT.
WHERE DID THEY ALL GO?

16:42.169 --> 16:43.670
- THE MUSIC WAS
FUCKING AWESOME!

16:43.703 --> 16:45.372
- AND ONLY A
BUCK A SHOOTER.

16:45.405 --> 16:48.241
- WHERE YOU BOYS BEEN ALL NIGHT?
- POPPERZ.

16:48.275 --> 16:51.578
- POPPERZ?
THAT DUMP'S OLDER THAN I AM.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.113
- ONLY THING THAT IS.

16:53.146 --> 16:54.514
[all laughing]

16:54.547 --> 16:57.417
- SO THERE YOU HAVE IT.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.422
- YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD KNOW...

17:02.455 --> 17:05.558
THERE'S NO ONE
MORE FICKLE THAN A FAG.

17:08.461 --> 17:09.562
[door closes]
- OH, HEY.

17:09.596 --> 17:12.532
- SORRY I'M LATE.

17:12.565 --> 17:16.336
THE WOMAN IN FRONT OF ME
HAD A STACK OF COUPONS.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.305
[child babbles]
HEY, SWEETIE.

17:18.338 --> 17:19.439
- HI, MOMMY.

17:19.472 --> 17:24.211
- DID YOU HAVE FUN WITH MAMA?

17:24.244 --> 17:25.412
HERE'S THE MAIL.

17:25.445 --> 17:26.813
- THANKS.

17:26.846 --> 17:30.150
- OKAY, BIG BOY,
GATHER UP YOUR TOYS.

17:30.183 --> 17:32.452
IT'S TIME TO GO.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.822
- MOM, I DON'T WANT TO GO.

17:35.855 --> 17:38.191
- ARE WE GOING TO GO
THROUGH THIS EVERY TIME?

17:38.225 --> 17:40.293
- HMM.

17:40.327 --> 17:42.295
- OH, IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.

17:42.329 --> 17:45.732
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW WHEN MOMMY
GOES TO WORK, OKAY?

17:45.765 --> 17:48.568
- HOW'S J.R.?
- UP ALL NIGHT, SCREAMING.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.570
- WHY DON'T YOU LET ME TAKE HER?

17:50.603 --> 17:52.439
- YOU CAN'T BE UP ALL NIGHT
AND LOOK AFTER GUS

17:52.472 --> 17:54.374
AND WORK ALL DAY.
- BUT YOU'RE EXHAUSTED.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.243
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME, OKAY?
I CAN HANDLE IT.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.345
- NO ONE SAID YOU COULDN'T.
- THEN DON'T START.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.780
- I'M NOT STARTING ANYTHING.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.715
I JUST WISH
THERE WAS SOME WAY WE COULD...

18:02.749 --> 18:04.484
- KISS AND MAKE UP?

18:04.517 --> 18:06.119
- GET ALONG.

18:06.153 --> 18:07.387
- OH, SHIT!

18:07.420 --> 18:08.655
- WHAT IS IT?

18:08.688 --> 18:12.192
- THAT LITTLE FUCKER
HIRED A LAWYER.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.593
- HER NAME IS BOBBI BENNETT.

18:13.626 --> 18:16.263
- I THOUGHT SHE WAS MARRIED
TO HUGH HEFNER.

18:16.296 --> 18:17.530
- THAT'S BARBI BENTON.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.666
THIS IS A TOUGH,
GAY LAWYER.

18:19.699 --> 18:22.202
- SHE TOOK THE FIRST GAY
ADOPTION CASE IN PENNSYLVANIA

18:22.235 --> 18:23.803
TO THE STATE SUPREME COURT
AND WON.

18:23.836 --> 18:26.139
- YEAH. SHE SAID, AS J.R.'S
BIOLOGICAL FATHER,

18:26.173 --> 18:27.607
I HAVE RIGHTS,
AND I SHOULD FIGHT FOR THEM.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.476
- NO. NO, I DON'T
LIKE IT THERE.

18:29.509 --> 18:31.544
- OH.

18:31.578 --> 18:34.247
SO SHE'S AGREED
TO TAKE OUR CASE.

18:34.281 --> 18:35.748
- I'M GLAD TO SEE
YOU STANDING UP FOR YOURSELF.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.417
I'M JUST SORRY IT
HAD TO COME TO THIS.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.787
- WELL, THEY DIDN'T LEAVE ME
ANY CHOICE.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.522
- I-IS THIS WHERE
YOU WANT IT, DEB?

18:42.555 --> 18:45.425
- WHERE I WANT IT IS IN
THE GARBAGE, BUT...

18:45.458 --> 18:47.660
IT'S CARL'S
FAVORITE CHAIR, SO...

18:58.738 --> 18:59.806
THERE,
THAT'S BETTER, HUH?

18:59.839 --> 19:01.841
- OH, YEAH, MUCH BETTER.

19:01.874 --> 19:04.377
- WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO LET
MY DAUGHTER BE RAISED

19:04.411 --> 19:06.179
BY A COUPLE
OF SINGLE MOTHERS.

19:06.213 --> 19:09.916
- WHEN THERE'S A LOVING,
STABLE HOME WITH TWO FATHERS.

19:09.949 --> 19:13.253
- "SINGLE MOTHERS"?
- HMM?

19:13.286 --> 19:16.289
- YOU JUST SAID
"SINGLE MOTHERS."

19:16.323 --> 19:18.858
YOU MEAN LIKE ME?
- I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT YOU.

19:18.891 --> 19:20.560
I WASN'T EVEN THINKING
ABOUT YOU.

19:20.593 --> 19:21.861
- YEAH, SO WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

19:21.894 --> 19:24.531
BUT I WAS A SINGLE MOTHER.
AND GUESS WHAT.

19:24.564 --> 19:26.299
EVEN WITHOUT A FATHER,

19:26.333 --> 19:28.268
YOU STILL HAD ENOUGH SENSE
TO COME IN OUT OF THE RAIN...

19:28.301 --> 19:29.602
SOMETIMES.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.538
- THAT'S NOT WHAT
I WAS TALKING ABOUT.

19:31.571 --> 19:33.440
FOR CHRIST SAKES, MOM, WILL YOU
STOP MISINTERPRETING?

19:33.473 --> 19:35.575
- WHO'S MISINTERPRETING?
- DEB, ALL WE'RE SAYING IS ...

19:35.608 --> 19:36.943
- I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

19:36.976 --> 19:39.212
I SPEAK THE LANGUAGE--
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

19:39.246 --> 19:40.813
YOU THINK BECAUSE
THERE ARE TWO OF YOU,

19:40.847 --> 19:43.316
THAT YOU'RE BETTER EQUIPPED
TO RAISE A KID.

19:43.350 --> 19:47.220
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU
TWO EXPERTS SOMETHING.

19:47.254 --> 19:49.622
NOT EVERYONE IS FORTUNATE ENOUGH
TO HAVE A PARTNER

19:49.656 --> 19:51.424
AND ENOUGH MONEY TO STAY HOME
AND RAISE THEIR KIDS.

19:51.458 --> 19:54.494
SOME OF US HAD TO WORK,
NIGHT AND DAY,

19:54.527 --> 19:56.896
SOMETIMES TILL 2:00
IN THE FUCKING MORNING,

19:56.929 --> 20:00.300
SO THAT OUR KIDS COULD HAVE
SNEAKERS AND JEANS

20:00.333 --> 20:02.569
AND WALKMANS AND--
AND GO TO THE MOVIES

20:02.602 --> 20:04.471
JUST LIKE ALL THEIR FRIENDS.

20:04.504 --> 20:05.905
AND WHILE WE WERE
OUT THERE WORKING,

20:05.938 --> 20:07.874
WE WERE JUST HOPING
AND PRAYING TO GOD

20:07.907 --> 20:11.878
THAT THEY DIDN'T GET
SICK OR GET IN TROUBLE.

20:11.911 --> 20:14.447
BUT WE HAD NO CHOICE.

20:14.481 --> 20:17.884
WE MADE WHATEVER SACRIFICE WE
COULD FOR OUR KIDS' HAPPINESS.

20:19.786 --> 20:24.657
SO YOU TWO THINK
YOU CAN DO IT BETTER...

20:24.691 --> 20:26.893
ALL I GOT TO SAY IS...

20:26.926 --> 20:29.228
GOOD FOR YOU.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.470
- I ALMOST
DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU

20:37.504 --> 20:39.906
SINCE YOU GAINED
ALL THAT WEIGHT.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.408
- IT'S NOT THAT MUCH.

20:41.441 --> 20:44.477
- I WISH I COULD GAIN WEIGHT
LIKE THAT.

20:44.511 --> 20:47.814
I TRY, AND I TRY,
AND I EAT, AND I EAT,

20:47.847 --> 20:50.817
BUT NO MATTER WHAT I DO,
I JUST CAN'T KEEP IT ON.

20:50.850 --> 20:51.951
- PITY.

20:51.984 --> 20:54.521
- CHOCOLATE?
- I'M ON A DIET.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.623
- OH, AND IT'S
ALREADY WORKING.

20:56.656 --> 20:59.058
YOUR HAIR IS
GETTING THINNER.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.960
- [scoffs] LOOK, WHATEVER
ELSE IS GOING ON,

21:00.993 --> 21:02.562
I'VE ALWAYS HAD
A HEALTHY HEAD OF HAIR.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.632
- WELL, I HATE TO CONTRADICT
MRS. BROLIN,

21:05.665 --> 21:08.501
BUT THE MIRROR
ONLY HAS ONE FACE,

21:08.535 --> 21:11.304
AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT.

21:11.338 --> 21:13.306
- SHIT!

21:13.340 --> 21:15.408
I'M GETTING BALD.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.777
W-W-WHAT DO I DO?
WHAT--W-WHAT DO I DO?

21:17.810 --> 21:19.846
- CONVERT TO JUDAISM
AND WEAR A YARMULKE?

21:19.879 --> 21:23.316
- THERE'S NO USE FIGHTING IT,
SWEETHEART.

21:25.452 --> 21:29.389
I'M AFRAID AGE IS THE LAST TRICK
ANY OF US PICKS UP.

21:29.422 --> 21:32.392
THE PROBLEM IS,
AFTER IT FUCKS US,

21:32.425 --> 21:34.461
IT DOESN'T LEAVE.

21:34.494 --> 21:35.928
SO, IF I WERE YOU,

21:35.962 --> 21:39.732
I'D STOP SINGING
THE TITLE SONG FROM "POOR ME"

21:39.766 --> 21:40.733
AND ACCEPT IT.

21:40.767 --> 21:43.002
- THEN WHAT--DIE?

21:43.035 --> 21:45.104
- OR MOVE TO PALM SPRINGS,

21:45.137 --> 21:48.675
POUR YOURSELF A MARTINI
AND OGLE THE...

21:48.708 --> 21:51.444
MEXICAN BOYS.

21:53.613 --> 21:57.016
- NOW, WHAT SHALL WE DO
WITH THIS?

21:58.485 --> 22:01.888
SAME OLD, SAME OLD?

22:01.921 --> 22:04.891
- OH, IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY
OF THESE WEDDINGS I DO,

22:04.924 --> 22:07.427
I ALWAYS GET A LUMP IN MY THROAT
AND A TEAR IN MY EYE.

22:07.460 --> 22:08.628
- MAYBE IT'S ALLERGIES.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.363
WHAT IF EVERYBODY
STARTS SNEEZING?

22:10.397 --> 22:11.864
YOU SEE? I TOLD YOU--
WE SHOULD HAVE HAD IT INDOORS.

22:11.898 --> 22:14.434
- THE ONLY SNIFFLES TODAY
WILL BE SNIFFLES OF JOY

22:14.467 --> 22:15.902
FROM HOW LOVELY
THE BRIDE LOOKS.

22:15.935 --> 22:17.470
- I STILL THINK
I SHOULD'VE LEFT MY HAIR DOWN.

22:17.504 --> 22:19.372
MY FACE LOOKS TOO ROUND,
DOESN'T IT?

22:19.406 --> 22:21.608
- IT'S THE PERFECT FRAME
FOR THE PERFECT PICTURE.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.843
- YOU HEAR THAT, HONEY?
- IT'S ALL AN ILLUSION.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.712
I'M A MESS.
ARE THOSE RAIN CLOUDS?

22:25.745 --> 22:28.014
- I THINK IT'S TIME TO CUE
THE WEDDING MARCH.

22:28.047 --> 22:29.882
- THOSE...
- YOU NEED TO RELAX.

22:29.916 --> 22:33.453
- [breathing heavily]

22:33.486 --> 22:34.987
OH.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.989
- TO MY BEAUTIFUL BRIDE.

22:37.023 --> 22:40.126
FROM NOW ON, YOU ARE MY
MORNING NEWS, MY EVENING NEWS,

22:40.159 --> 22:41.894
AND MY SPECIAL REPORT.

22:41.928 --> 22:44.997
- DON, WHAT
A BEAUTIFUL SENTIMENT.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.132
[yelping]

22:46.165 --> 22:48.134
OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD!

22:48.167 --> 22:50.770
ALL RIGHT,
PLACES, EVERY--

22:50.803 --> 22:52.605
- I TOLD YOU SOMETHING
WOULD GO WRONG, DIDN'T I?

22:52.639 --> 22:54.507
DIDN'T I TELL YOU
THERE'D BE A DISASTER?

22:54.541 --> 22:56.008
[Wedding March plays]
MY BLOUSE! LOOK AT ME!

22:56.042 --> 22:57.644
HOW CAN I GO OUT THERE?
I CAN'T. IT'S RUINED.

22:57.677 --> 22:58.945
EVERYTHING IS RUINED!

22:58.978 --> 23:01.614
[sobbing]
- TAKE IT OFF.

23:01.648 --> 23:02.882
- WHAT?
- TAKE IT OFF.

23:02.915 --> 23:04.417
TAKE YOUR BLOUSE OFF.
BE QUICK ABOUT IT.

23:04.451 --> 23:05.552
COME ON, WE'VE GOT
150 GUESTS WATCHING.

23:05.585 --> 23:06.753
CHOP-CHOP!
- OKAY.

23:06.786 --> 23:08.888
[crying]

23:08.921 --> 23:11.157
OH, MY GOD.

23:11.190 --> 23:14.827
- GO, GO, GO, GO.
- GOING.

23:14.861 --> 23:18.498
- [sighs]

23:18.531 --> 23:21.634
I NEED A SOUP POT AND TWO
BOTTLES OF BURGUNDY, PLEASE.

23:21.668 --> 23:23.069
VITE! VITE!

23:23.102 --> 23:25.638
FAST AS WE CAN, PEOPLE. PLEASE.

23:25.672 --> 23:28.174
- OH, YOU--
YOU WANT A CHICKEN TOO?

23:28.207 --> 23:29.976
IT'S A HELL OF A TIME
TO MAKE COQ AU VIN--

23:30.009 --> 23:33.212
TWO MINUTES
BEFORE OUR WEDDING.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.047
- WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING?

23:35.081 --> 23:37.584
- SHH, SHH, SHH.
[humming]

23:37.617 --> 23:39.185
- JUST BECAUSE
I DIDN'T CARRY HER

23:39.218 --> 23:41.053
DOESN'T MEAN
I'M NOT HER MOTHER TOO.

23:41.087 --> 23:43.656
- SEE THE CHOO-CHOO GO AROUND
THE TRACK, SONNY BOY?

23:43.690 --> 23:45.191
SEE IT?

23:45.224 --> 23:47.059
SURE IS FUN.

23:47.093 --> 23:50.797
BUT AFTER A WHILE, IT GETS
MONOTONOUS AND PREDICTABLE.

23:50.830 --> 23:53.199
AND THAT'S WHEN WE THROW OFF
THE SHACKLES OF CONVENTION

23:53.232 --> 23:55.101
AND RELINQUISH CONTROL

23:55.134 --> 23:57.670
AND CAUSE A SENSELESS,

23:57.704 --> 24:00.573
TRAGIC DISASTER!
[imitates crash]

24:00.607 --> 24:03.476
OH, MY GOD.
DID YOU SEE THAT?

24:03.510 --> 24:05.144
- BRIAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24:05.177 --> 24:07.680
- I'M JUST TEACHING
MY SON HOW TO HAVE FUN.

24:07.714 --> 24:09.148
- WELL, I WISH YOU'D LISTEN
TO WHAT I'M SAYING.

24:09.181 --> 24:11.150
- "JUST BECAUSE
I DIDN'T CARRY HER

24:11.183 --> 24:12.752
DOESN'T MEAN
I'M NOT HER MOTHER TOO."

24:12.785 --> 24:14.554
- I WAS THERE EVERY STEP
OF THE WAY--

24:14.587 --> 24:18.257
IMPREGNATING HER, COACHING HER,
TAKING CARE OF HER.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.092
I EVEN HELPED
WITH THE DELIVERY.

24:20.126 --> 24:22.629
- SO WHO SAYS YOU'RE NOT?

24:22.662 --> 24:24.731
- MICHAEL.

24:24.764 --> 24:26.265
HE'S PETITIONING
FOR JOINT CUSTODY

24:26.298 --> 24:29.101
AND 50% PHYSICAL CUSTODY.

24:29.135 --> 24:32.004
- WELL, WHO THE HELL
DOES HE THINK HE IS--THE FATHER?

24:32.038 --> 24:33.773
- THE AGREEMENT WAS
THAT HE WOULD ALWAYS BE A PART

24:33.806 --> 24:36.609
OF THE BABY'S LIFE,
BUT MEL AND I WOULD RAISE HER.

24:36.643 --> 24:37.844
- TOGETHER.

24:37.877 --> 24:39.111
- IT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY DIFFERENCE.

24:39.145 --> 24:40.647
WE'RE STILL THE SAME PEOPLE.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.048
WE'RE STILL
JENNY REBECCA'S PARENTS.

24:42.081 --> 24:44.984
- WELL, HE SEEMS
TO FEEL DIFFERENTLY.

24:45.017 --> 24:47.286
- IF ONLY MELANIE
HAD BEEN REASONABLE.

24:47.319 --> 24:48.655
- [scoffs]
MELANIE?

24:48.688 --> 24:50.256
OUR LITTLE MELANIE?

24:50.289 --> 24:51.758
REASONABLE?

24:51.791 --> 24:54.060
- INSTEAD OF TRYING
TO FORCE HIM OUT.

24:54.093 --> 24:55.728
NOW, IF HE GOES THROUGH
WITH THIS,

24:55.762 --> 24:57.797
I'LL BE THE ONE
WHO'S FORCED OUT.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.932
THE COURT WILL SAY I'M
THE ONE WITH NO LEGAL RIGHTS.

24:59.966 --> 25:02.535
- [clicks tongue]
IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR MOMMY

25:02.569 --> 25:04.070
IS IN QUITE A PREDICAMENT.

25:04.103 --> 25:07.640
- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT
SHE IS.

25:09.942 --> 25:13.512
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WHAT A MESS MY LIFE'S BECOME.

25:14.981 --> 25:17.149
- YOU NEED MONEY?

25:17.183 --> 25:20.286
- WHAT I NEED
IS FOR YOU TO TALK TO HIM.

25:20.319 --> 25:22.622
YOU'RE HIS BEST FRIEND.

25:22.655 --> 25:24.824
- HEY, GUS.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.193
IT'S OKAY, SONNY BOY.

25:27.226 --> 25:29.962
WE WILL GET IT BACK ON TRACK.
- WHICH ONE?

25:29.996 --> 25:32.064
- WAIT.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.602
OKAY, FLIP THE SWITCH.

25:36.969 --> 25:38.938
- AND THAT SHOULD
JUST ABOUT DO IT.

25:38.971 --> 25:40.940
AH, JUST TAKE THAT, PLEASE.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

25:40.973 --> 25:44.310
OH, OH, RIGHT HERE.
PERFECT.

25:44.343 --> 25:48.180
HERE WE GO--
AND ONE AND TWO...

25:48.214 --> 25:50.950
THERE.
IT EVEN MATCHES YOUR BOUQUET.

25:50.983 --> 25:53.185
[applause]
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

LET'S GO!
LET'S GO, LET'S GO!

25:54.821 --> 25:58.057
- YOU'RE A GENIUS!
- I AM NOT A GENIUS.

25:58.090 --> 25:59.992
MY AUNT LULAH IS THE GENIUS.

26:00.026 --> 26:02.028
SEE, UM, BACK IN HAZELHURST,
WHEN I WAS A BOY,

26:02.061 --> 26:03.963
MY MAMA WORKED AND SCRAPED
TO BUY ME A PAIR

26:03.996 --> 26:05.965
OF GOOD WHITE PANTS
FOR CHURCH.

26:05.998 --> 26:07.199
WELL, BEFORE WE GOT THERE,

26:07.233 --> 26:08.735
I STOLE
SOME BOYSENBERRY COBBLER,

26:08.768 --> 26:11.103
AND, UH, YOU CAN IMAGINE
THE REST.

26:11.137 --> 26:13.205
WELL, MAMA WAS JUST
ABOUT TO WHUP ME,

26:13.239 --> 26:14.674
BUT AUNT LULAH
SAVED THE DAY.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.609
SHE PICKED A MESS
OF BOYSENBERRIES,

26:16.643 --> 26:18.277
MADE SOME BOYSENBERRY JUICE,
AND THE NEXT SUNDAY

26:18.310 --> 26:20.012
I HAD THE MOST FABULOUS
PURPLE PANTS TO WEAR TO CHURCH,

26:20.046 --> 26:21.347
WHICH I, OF COURSE, ACCESSORIZED

26:21.380 --> 26:23.149
WITH A YELLOW SWEATER
AND A PINK SCARF.

26:23.182 --> 26:24.684
- THAT'S A HELL OF A STORY.

26:24.717 --> 26:25.952
- IT'S HOW
I GOT MY FAIRY WINGS--

26:25.985 --> 26:27.720
BY LEARNING
HOW TO TURN A DISASTER

26:27.754 --> 26:30.690
INTO SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.759
NOW, YOU TWO, WALK
DOWN THAT AISLE

26:32.792 --> 26:34.293
AND LIVE HAPPILY
EVER AFTER.

26:34.326 --> 26:35.762

SO, UH, GUESS IT'S
OFF TO MY PLACE.

A BACK ROOM AT BABYLON.

HEY, HEY.

TO STOP BY LATER.

THE COMPETITION.

UP ALL NIGHT.

30:20.953 --> 30:23.455
- LOOK, YOU REALLY
SHOULDN'T BE HERE,

30:23.489 --> 30:27.093
CONSIDERING HE PLANS
TO SUE ME FOR CUSTODY.

30:27.126 --> 30:29.929
- YOU STILL HAVEN'T LEARNED,
HAVE YOU?

30:29.962 --> 30:33.399
WE HAVE A CHILD HERE
WITH A PROBLEM.

30:33.432 --> 30:36.202
YOU GOT A HOT-WATER BOTTLE?

30:36.235 --> 30:38.204
- IN THE KITCHEN,
I THINK.

30:38.237 --> 30:41.607
- FILL IT...

30:41.640 --> 30:43.275
WITH WARM WATER.

30:43.309 --> 30:44.643
[baby crying]

30:44.676 --> 30:46.412
GRANDMA'S GOING TO MAKE IT
ALL RIGHT.

30:46.445 --> 30:48.881
YES, SHE IS.

30:48.915 --> 30:51.150
GRANDMA'S GOING TO MAKE IT
ALL RIGHT.

30:51.183 --> 30:54.286
YES, I KNOW IT HURTS.
I KNOW IT HURTS.

30:54.320 --> 30:56.422
HERE'S MOMMY.

30:56.455 --> 30:59.358
THANKS.

30:59.391 --> 31:01.227
[baby wailing]

31:01.260 --> 31:05.064
SHH, SHH, SHH.

31:07.299 --> 31:08.968
- DEBBIE...

31:09.001 --> 31:10.903
I KNOW YOU WANT TO SEE
YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER,

31:10.937 --> 31:12.905
AND I APPRECIATE
YOUR HELP, BUT...

31:12.939 --> 31:14.373
- BUT WHAT?

31:14.406 --> 31:16.408
- UNTIL THIS
THING'S SETTLED...

31:16.442 --> 31:19.245
- AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
IT ALREADY IS.

31:19.278 --> 31:20.679
THE THREE OF YOU CARRYING ON,

31:20.712 --> 31:22.514
EACH OF YOU WANTING A PIECE
OF THIS POOR CHILD,

31:22.548 --> 31:24.984
IT'S SHAMEFUL.

31:25.017 --> 31:29.288
IT'S WORSE THAN THAT KING,
YOU KNOW THE ONE--SOLOMON.

31:29.321 --> 31:31.657
YES.

31:31.690 --> 31:34.660
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE...

31:34.693 --> 31:39.131
I SAY A BABY BELONGS
WITH ITS MOTHER.

31:39.165 --> 31:41.600
- YOU DO?

31:41.633 --> 31:44.403
- MAYBE IT'S 'CAUSE
I'M A MOTHER...

31:44.436 --> 31:46.472
A SINGLE MOTHER.

31:46.505 --> 31:48.307
AND ANYONE WHO ISN'T
OR NEVER HAS BEEN

31:48.340 --> 31:51.177
HASN'T A FUCKING CLUE
HOW TOUGH THAT IS,

31:51.210 --> 31:53.612
AND THAT INCLUDES MY SON.

31:56.715 --> 32:00.086
SO, WHATEVER I CAN DO
TO HELP, I'M HERE.

32:00.119 --> 32:03.055
- THANK YOU
FOR BEING ON MY SIDE.

32:03.089 --> 32:06.292
- NOW HEAR THIS.

32:06.325 --> 32:10.062
THE ONLY ONE WHOSE SIDE I'M ON
IS MY GRANDDAUGHTER'S.

32:10.096 --> 32:12.664
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, HONEYBUN?

32:17.136 --> 32:19.571
[sighs]
SO TIRED.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.507
- I HATED IT OUT THERE.

32:21.540 --> 32:23.109
THE WEATHER NEVER CHANGES.

32:23.142 --> 32:25.511
ALL ANYBODY TALKS ABOUT
IS THE BUSINESS,

32:25.544 --> 32:27.479
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GO PROJECT,
YOU'RE INVISIBLE.

32:27.513 --> 32:29.315
- YEAH, YEAH. AS THEY SAY IN THE
MOVIES, CUT TO THE CHASE.

32:29.348 --> 32:31.083
THE GUYS ARE HOT!

32:31.117 --> 32:33.719
- EXCEPT AFTER A WHILE, THEY
ALL START TO LOOK THE SAME--

32:33.752 --> 32:36.188
PERFECT HAIR, PERFECT TEETH,
PERFECT BODIES.

32:36.222 --> 32:37.623
- SOUNDS PERFECTLY AWFUL.

32:37.656 --> 32:39.458
- AND YOU CANNOT TRUST ANYONE

32:39.491 --> 32:41.527
OR BELIEVE ANYTHING
THAT ANYBODY EVER SAYS.

32:41.560 --> 32:44.496
EVERYBODY'S JUST LOOKING OUT FOR
THEMSELVES AND THEIR CAREERS.

32:44.530 --> 32:46.765
- YEAH, SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE WHAT
YOU ALWAYS HEAR ABOUT L.A.--

32:46.798 --> 32:49.068
A LOT OF SHALLOW,
SUPERFICIAL ASSHOLES

32:49.101 --> 32:50.736
DESPERATELY TRYING TO
BE WHAT THEY'RE NOT.

32:50.769 --> 32:53.139
[scoffs]

32:53.172 --> 32:55.207
- HEY, DEB.

32:55.241 --> 32:57.343
CAN I GET A SOUP SPOON?
- YOU SURE CAN, HONEY.

32:57.376 --> 32:59.145
THEY'RE OVER BY THE COUNTER.
HELP YOURSELF.

32:59.178 --> 33:01.647
YOU'RE LUCKY YOU GOT
OUT OF THERE IN ONE PIECE, BABY.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.515
- SO MUCH
FOR RAGE: THE MOVIE.

33:03.549 --> 33:05.351
- SO MUCH
FOR "RAGE: THE MONEY."

33:05.384 --> 33:07.286
- UH, IT'S OKAY.
WE'LL BE FINE.

33:07.319 --> 33:09.555
- YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST AS WELL
THAT THEY DIDN'T MAKE IT.

33:09.588 --> 33:11.690
BEN, YOU WERE RIGHT--BY THE TIME
THEY'D HAVE FINISHED IT,

33:11.723 --> 33:14.693
RAGE WOULD'VE WOUND UP
STRAIGHT.

33:14.726 --> 33:16.762
- AT LEAST WE STILL
HAVE THE COMIC...

33:16.795 --> 33:18.764
OUR COMIC.
- AND MOST IMPORTANT--

33:18.797 --> 33:20.532
YOU'RE BACK HERE WITH US
WHERE YOU BELONG.

33:20.566 --> 33:22.401
- YEAH, WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO NOW, BABY?

33:22.434 --> 33:24.770
- I HAVEN'T HAD MUCH CHANCE
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

33:24.803 --> 33:26.372
- DON'T YOU WORRY, BABY.

33:26.405 --> 33:28.240
YOUR OLD JOB IS STILL
HERE WAITING FOR YOU.

33:28.274 --> 33:31.777
YOU CAN START BUSSING TABLES
ANYTIME YOU WANT.

33:31.810 --> 33:33.179
[smooches]

33:36.148 --> 33:38.650
- SO WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SLIT YOUR THROAT NOW

33:38.684 --> 33:41.187
OR AFTER WE HAVE COFFEE?

33:47.359 --> 33:49.795
- EMMETT,
WELCOME TO CHANNEL 5 NEWS.

33:49.828 --> 33:52.131
EVERYONE IS STILL RAVING
ABOUT THE WEDDING.

33:52.164 --> 33:53.832
LILA'S FRIENDS WANT TO KNOW
WHERE SHE GOT THAT BLOUSE.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.667
SAID THEY NEVER SAW
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL COLOR.

33:55.701 --> 33:57.803
- WELL, I'M JUST RELIEVED
EVERYTHING WORKED OUT ALL RIGHT.

33:57.836 --> 33:59.338
IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE
I CAN DO FOR YOU,

33:59.371 --> 34:00.672
YOU KNOW,
YOUR NEXT WEDDING.

34:00.706 --> 34:03.442
[chuckles]
- ACTUALLY, THERE IS.

34:03.475 --> 34:06.445
I WATCHED YOU, DAY AFTER DAY,
THROUGH THIS ENTIRE EVENT.

34:06.478 --> 34:08.280
- YOU DID?

34:08.314 --> 34:11.617
- AND I HAVE
A LITTLE PROPOSITION TO MAKE.

34:11.650 --> 34:13.419
- YOU DO?

34:13.452 --> 34:16.755
- I WANT YOU, EMMETT.

34:16.788 --> 34:19.458
- LORD, WHAT IS IT
WITH ME AND STRAIGHT MEN?

34:19.491 --> 34:22.828
UM, MR. MAGRUDER,
I'M VERY FLATTERED,

34:22.861 --> 34:25.231
BUT YOU'RE
A MARRIED MAN NOW, SO...

34:25.264 --> 34:27.299
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU...?
YOU DON'T THINK I...?

34:27.333 --> 34:29.168
[laughing]

34:29.201 --> 34:33.305
PLEASE. NO.

34:33.339 --> 34:34.873
- WELL, YOU DID SAY
YOU WANTED ME.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.508
- FOR THE NEWS TEAM.

34:36.542 --> 34:40.179
- AS WHAT--SPORTS COMMENTATOR,
WEATHER GIRL?

34:40.212 --> 34:42.781
EITHER WAY, I-I THINK YOU'D
BE TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED.

34:42.814 --> 34:44.250
- LISTEN,
I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU,

34:44.283 --> 34:45.484
QUEER IS VERY
HOT RIGHT NOW.

34:45.517 --> 34:47.319
EVERYBODY WANTS
THE GAY PERSPECTIVE,

34:47.353 --> 34:49.855
WHAT DO THE GAYS THINK ABOUT
FASHION, COOKING, DECORATING?

34:49.888 --> 34:51.857
LIKE YOU SAID,
THAT LITTLE FAIRY MAGIC

34:51.890 --> 34:53.659
THAT GIVES US STRAIGHTS
A LITTLE TWIST.

34:53.692 --> 34:55.727
AND YOU WANT ME TO...?

34:55.761 --> 34:57.196
- TO DO A NEW SEGMENT.

34:57.229 --> 34:59.131
OFFER US
THE, UH, GAY POINT OF VIEW.

34:59.165 --> 35:00.799
GIVE US SOME TIPS.

35:00.832 --> 35:02.868
DO SOME MAKEOVERS.
- BUT I-I'VE NEVER ...

35:02.901 --> 35:04.803
- AFTER THAT MAGIC ACT
YOU PERFORMED AT OUR WEDDING,

35:04.836 --> 35:06.872
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.

35:06.905 --> 35:10.376
THAT INCLUDES BEING
CHANNEL 5'S QUEER GUY.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.216
[door closes]

35:17.249 --> 35:18.817
- WITHOUT THE LIGHTS
AND THE MUSIC

35:18.850 --> 35:21.553
AND THE HOT GUYS,
THIS IS JUST A ROOM, ISN'T IT?

35:21.587 --> 35:24.156
- IT'S ALL AN ILLUSION.

35:24.190 --> 35:27.359
NOTHING BUT
CHEAP THEATRICS.

35:27.393 --> 35:28.627
SORRY ABOUT YOUR BABY.

35:28.660 --> 35:30.762
- JENNY?
- RAGE.

35:30.796 --> 35:32.764
OH, THAT. WELL...

35:32.798 --> 35:36.768
RIGHT NOW I GOT MORE IMPORTANT
THINGS TO THINK ABOUT.

35:36.802 --> 35:40.906
SO WHY THE URGENT MESSAGE
ON MY CELL?

35:40.939 --> 35:45.244
- I WANT YOU TO LEAVE
MELANIE AND LINDSAY ALONE.

35:45.277 --> 35:46.512
THEY HAVE ENOUGH SHIT
TO WORK OUT RIGHT NOW,

35:46.545 --> 35:47.813
WITHOUT YOU SICCING
YOUR BULLDOG,

35:47.846 --> 35:50.916
OR SHOULD I SAY BULL-DYKE,
LAWYER ON THEM.

35:50.949 --> 35:52.684
- WELL, WHAT THE FUCK
BUSINESS IS IT OF YOURS

35:52.718 --> 35:55.321
IF I WANT TO HIRE A LAWYER?
WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU TO...?

35:55.354 --> 35:57.723
- I'M GUS' FATHER.
THAT'S WHO THE FUCK I AM.

35:57.756 --> 36:00.326
- YOU HAD TO LOSE A BALL BEFORE
YOU EVEN KNEW HE WAS ALIVE.

36:06.632 --> 36:08.800
I'M SORRY. THAT WAS A...

36:08.834 --> 36:11.403
UNCALLED-FOR REMARK.
IT'S JUST THAT...

36:11.437 --> 36:13.539
BECAUSE THEY'RE
YOUR SON'S PARENTS TOO,

36:13.572 --> 36:15.307
I THOUGHT YOU'D UNDERSTAND.

36:15.341 --> 36:17.943
- WHAT I UNDERSTAND IS THAT
IF YOU GO THROUGH WITH THIS,

36:17.976 --> 36:19.811
LINDSAY'S GOING TO BE
THE ONE THAT GETS LEFT OUT.

36:19.845 --> 36:21.613
SHE'S GOING TO BE THE ONE
THAT GETS FUCKED OVER.

36:21.647 --> 36:23.282
- WELL, SHE SHOULD'VE THOUGHT
OF THAT

36:23.315 --> 36:25.317
BEFORE SHE CHEATED ON MEL
AND THEN LIED TO ME.

36:25.351 --> 36:27.553
- CHRIST. WOULD YOU GIVE
IT A REST ALREADY?

36:27.586 --> 36:29.555
WE ALL KNOW THE STORY.

36:29.588 --> 36:31.423
- WHY DON'T YOU STOP
DEFENDING HER FOR A CHANGE

36:31.457 --> 36:35.694
AND TRY DEFENDING ME,
YOUR BEST FRIEND?

36:35.727 --> 36:37.563
RIGHT NOW THE BEST THING
FOR JENNY REBECCA

36:37.596 --> 36:39.431
IS TO BE WITH BEN AND ME,
IN A STABLE HOME,

36:39.465 --> 36:43.969
NOT BEING PASSED BACK AND FORTH
BETWEEN TWO BATTLING LESBIANS.

36:44.002 --> 36:47.439
- WHEN DID YOU CHANGE?

36:47.473 --> 36:48.840
- WHAT?

36:48.874 --> 36:50.342
- WHEN DID YOU BECOME
THIS PIOUS,

36:50.376 --> 36:55.314
SANCTIMONIOUS,
JUDGMENTAL TWIT?

36:55.347 --> 36:57.983
- THE POINT IS NOT
WHEN DID I CHANGE.

36:58.016 --> 37:01.353
THE POINT IS,
WHY HAVEN'T YOU?

37:01.387 --> 37:02.988
WHEN ARE YOU GOING
TO STOP BEING SOME...

37:03.021 --> 37:05.324
OVER-THE-HILL CLUB BOY
AND GROW UP.

37:05.357 --> 37:08.360
- OH, SO NOW I'M THE OBJECT
OF YOUR DISAPPROVAL TOO.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.664
YOU AND THE NUTTY PROFESSOR
GET MARRIED,

37:12.698 --> 37:15.467
IN FUCKING CANADA!

37:15.501 --> 37:16.802
YOU MOVE TO STEPFORD AVENUE

37:16.835 --> 37:19.471
WITH ALL THE OTHER
ERSATZ HETEROSEXUALS,

37:19.505 --> 37:21.373
AND SUDDENLY
THAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT

37:21.407 --> 37:25.744
TO MAKE PRONOUNCEMENTS
ON EVERYBODY ELSE'S LIFE?

37:25.777 --> 37:29.014
WELL, WELCOME TO THE OTHER SIDE
OF YOUR PERFECT MARRIAGE, MIKEY.

37:29.047 --> 37:32.484
IT'S CALLED GAY DIVORCE.

37:32.518 --> 37:34.486
FAGS AND DYKES
CAN FUCK UP THEIR LIVES

37:34.520 --> 37:37.889
JUST LIKE THE REST
OF THE WORLD.

37:37.923 --> 37:40.626
- I'M JUST TRYING TO DO
WHAT'S BEST FOR MY DAUGHTER

37:40.659 --> 37:42.394
AND PROTECT MY RIGHTS.

37:45.664 --> 37:47.966
I'M SORRY YOU
CAN'T SEE THAT.

*

38:16.695 --> 38:19.531
[doorbell rings]

38:19.565 --> 38:23.469
- JUST CALL ME
"THE QUEER GUY."

38:23.502 --> 38:27.072
- WOULDN'T THAT BE LIKE CALLING
THE POPE "THE CATHOLIC GUY"?

38:27.105 --> 38:29.074
- DON MAGRUDER, THE PRODUCER
OF THE CHANNEL 5 NEWS--

38:29.107 --> 38:32.077
I JUST DID HIS WEDDING--
WANTS ME TO JOIN THE NEWS TEAM.

38:32.110 --> 38:34.546
I AM RETURNING
TO THE CAMERAS.

38:34.580 --> 38:36.682
THIS TIME
WITH MY CLOTHES ON.

38:36.715 --> 38:39.117
I'M GOING TO BE CHANNEL 5'S
"QUEER GUY,"

38:39.150 --> 38:40.886
SHARING TIPS, MAKING QUIPS

38:40.919 --> 38:43.422
AND GENERALLY SHOWING PITTSBURGH
HOW TO BE FABULOUS.

38:43.455 --> 38:46.492
- YOU CAN START
BY SHOWING ME.

38:46.525 --> 38:48.427
LOOK AT MY HAIR, MY...

38:48.460 --> 38:50.429
GUT, MY FACE.

38:50.462 --> 38:51.830
GOD, I LOOK
LIKE A SHAR-PEI.

38:51.863 --> 38:54.833
- THERE IS NOTHING WRONG
WITH THE WAY YOU LOOK.

38:54.866 --> 38:56.602
- WOULD YOU STOP BEING A FRIEND
AND BE HONEST.

38:56.635 --> 38:58.970
- I AM BEING HONEST.
COME HERE.

38:59.004 --> 39:01.907
COME HERE.

39:01.940 --> 39:03.975
LOOK AT YOURSELF.
- [sighs]

39:04.009 --> 39:06.111
- YOUR TRUE SELF...

39:06.144 --> 39:09.748
THE SELF THAT KICKED CRYSTAL,
THAT COMPLETED THE LIBERTY RIDE,

39:09.781 --> 39:10.916
THAT GOT A GREAT JOB.

39:10.949 --> 39:12.918
YOU TURNED
YOUR LIFE AROUND, TEDDY.

39:12.951 --> 39:15.587
AND THAT IS SOMETHING
TO BE VERY, VERY PROUD OF.

39:15.621 --> 39:17.589
YOU'RE PRACTICALLY
A HERO, OKAY?

39:17.623 --> 39:19.591
SO WHO CARES
IF YOU PUT ON A FEW POUNDS,

39:19.625 --> 39:22.461
OR HAVE A FEW
CHARACTER LINES?

39:22.494 --> 39:25.897
STOP LOOKING AT THE SHELL
AND SEE THE PEARL.

39:28.900 --> 39:31.603
- YOU'RE RIGHT, EM.

39:31.637 --> 39:35.674
YOU'RE SO RIGHT.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.743
IT DID SOUND GOOD,
DIDN'T IT?

39:37.776 --> 39:40.612
MAYBE I CAN USE THAT
IN A SEGMENT.

39:40.646 --> 39:43.682
WELL, THIS QUEER GUY'S
GOT TO GET TO THE GYM

39:43.715 --> 39:46.017
AND THEN, UH, GET
SOME BEAUTY REST.

39:46.051 --> 39:47.919
THE CAMERA'S MERCILESS,
YOU KNOW.

39:47.953 --> 39:50.756

AND IMMEDIATELY ADDS 10 POUNDS.

I'LL SEE YA, BABY!

HEY, YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE
A GREAT QUEER GUY.

39:56.662 --> 39:59.598
YOU ALREADY ARE.
- CAN'T HELP IT.

40:20.151 --> 40:23.789
- HI. UH, YES, UH,
MY NAME IS TED SCHMIDT,

40:23.822 --> 40:27.058
AND I'D LIKE TO MAKE AN
APPOINTMENT TO SEE THE DOCTOR.

40:27.092 --> 40:29.194
[door bells jingle]

40:29.227 --> 40:31.830
- BE RIGHT WITH YOU.

40:36.868 --> 40:39.605
MY ATTORNEY ADVISED ME
NOT TO TALK TO YOU.

40:39.638 --> 40:41.607
- WELL, I'M AN ATTORNEY TOO,

40:41.640 --> 40:44.943
AND I'D SAY SHE'S BEING
OVERLY CAUTIOUS.

40:44.976 --> 40:47.679
AFTER ALL, WE'RE FRIENDS...

40:47.713 --> 40:49.815
FAMILY.

40:49.848 --> 40:51.717
- ARE WE?

40:51.750 --> 40:54.820
I'M SURE
WE CAN WORK THIS OUT,

40:54.853 --> 40:56.888
SAVE OURSELVES A LOT OF GRIEF
AND LEGAL EXPENSES,

40:56.922 --> 40:58.690
WHICH, IF I KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT LAWYERS,

40:58.724 --> 41:02.694
IS WHY SHE DOESN'T WANT US
COMMUNICATING.

41:02.728 --> 41:06.632
LOOK, I ADMIT I OVERREACTED.

41:06.665 --> 41:09.501
I WAS JUST BEING PROTECTIVE,
THE WAY ANY MOTHER WOULD.

41:09.535 --> 41:11.703
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

41:11.737 --> 41:13.639
- I SUPPOSE.

41:15.807 --> 41:19.578
- THERE'S NO QUESTION YOU'RE
PART OF JENNY REBECCA'S LIFE.

41:19.611 --> 41:21.913
IT'S JUST THAT
SHE'S STILL YOUNG.

41:21.947 --> 41:24.149
SHE'S STILL BREAST-FEEDING.

41:24.182 --> 41:26.985
SO I WAS THINKING THAT MAYBE
LATER ON DOWN THE ROAD,

41:27.018 --> 41:28.854
SAY WHEN SHE'S FOUR OR FIVE,

41:28.887 --> 41:30.856
SHE COULD SPEND SOME TIME
WITH YOU AND BEN.

41:30.889 --> 41:33.592
I THINK THAT'S
PERFECTLY REASONABLE.

41:33.625 --> 41:35.894
DON'T YOU?

41:38.163 --> 41:41.132
- HOW DUMB DO YOU THINK I AM?

41:41.166 --> 41:45.604
NO, DON'T ANSWER THAT.
I CAN IMAGINE.

41:45.637 --> 41:47.806
FIRST, YOU TELL ME I HAVE
NO RIGHTS, WHICH ISN'T TRUE.

41:47.839 --> 41:49.174
I HAVE AS MUCH RIGHTS AS YOU.

41:49.207 --> 41:51.643
NOW YOU TRY TO GET ME
TO AGREE NOT TO TAKE HER

41:51.677 --> 41:54.112
UNTIL SHE'S FOUR OR FIVE?

41:56.915 --> 41:58.884
I'M SORRY, MEL.
I'M NOT BACKING OFF.

41:58.917 --> 42:00.952
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE DOING THIS,

42:00.986 --> 42:02.854
AFTER WE STOOD
RIGHT HERE IN YOUR STORE

42:02.888 --> 42:04.623
AND AGREED THAT YOU COULD BE
THE FATHER

42:04.656 --> 42:05.924
INSTEAD OF JUST A SPERM DONOR.

42:05.957 --> 42:07.759
- THEN WHY WON'T YOU
LET ME HAVE HER?

42:07.793 --> 42:09.227
- BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW SHIT
ABOUT RAISING A BABY.

42:09.260 --> 42:11.329
EVEN YOUR OWN MOTHER AGREES.
- MY MOTHER?

42:11.362 --> 42:13.164
- YEAH, SHE THINKS
YOU'RE BEHAVING LIKE AN ASSHOLE.

42:13.198 --> 42:16.167
- OH, REALLY?
YOU KNOW WHAT?

42:16.201 --> 42:19.070
I DON'T GIVE A FLYING FUCK
WHAT MY MOTHER THINKS.

42:19.104 --> 42:20.906
JENNY REBECCA
IS MY DAUGHTER TOO,

42:20.939 --> 42:24.042
AND I'M GOING TO
HAVE JOINT CUSTODY.

42:24.075 --> 42:27.979
- THEN YOU GO AHEAD AND TRY,
BUT LET ME TELL YOU--

42:28.013 --> 42:31.182
YOU'RE NOT ONLY UP AGAINST
ONE ANGRY MOTHER AND LESBIAN,

42:31.216 --> 42:34.485
YOU'RE UP AGAINST
ONE PISSED-OFF LAWYER.

*

43:25.771 --> 43:28.239
SO...

43:28.273 --> 43:30.876
WAS IT ALL
YOU REMEMBERED?

43:30.909 --> 43:33.879
- AND MORE.
- HMM.

43:33.912 --> 43:37.382
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?
- MMM.

43:37.415 --> 43:39.384
IT WAS OKAY.

43:39.417 --> 43:41.386
[both chuckle]

43:41.419 --> 43:43.254
- JUST OKAY?

43:43.288 --> 43:44.990
IT WAS GREAT.

43:45.023 --> 43:46.992
SAY IT WAS GREAT!
- [chuckles]

43:47.025 --> 43:49.394
- SAY IT WAS GREAT.
SAY IT.

43:49.427 --> 43:51.262
- [laughing]

43:51.296 --> 43:55.734
IT WAS GREAT. IT WAS GREAT.
IT WAS GREAT. IT WAS GREAT.

43:55.767 --> 43:57.268
- MM.
- IT WAS.

43:57.302 --> 44:00.038
IT WAS GREAT.

44:03.709 --> 44:06.745
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE NEVER COMING BACK.

44:06.778 --> 44:10.281
- I FIGURED.

44:10.315 --> 44:12.984
- WELL, WHY WOULD YOU?

44:15.453 --> 44:17.388
CAN'T IMAGINE.

44:48.486 --> 44:50.688
- WHAT'S THIS?

44:54.092 --> 44:56.461
- [sighs]

44:56.494 --> 45:00.198
IT'S ONE OF MY STORYBOARDS
FROM THE MOVIE.

45:00.231 --> 45:02.133
- IT'S GOOD.

45:02.167 --> 45:04.102
- THANKS.

45:10.008 --> 45:12.277
- WHAT?
- NOTHING.

45:18.116 --> 45:21.152
I TOLD EVERYONE
HOW SHITTY IT WAS OUT THERE...

45:21.186 --> 45:24.489
HOW STUPID EVERYONE WAS.

45:24.522 --> 45:26.257
THE TRUTH IS I LOVED IT.

45:29.127 --> 45:32.163
- I KNOW.
[chuckles]

45:32.197 --> 45:35.867
IT WAS HOT. IT WAS FUN.
IT WAS EXCITING.

45:37.903 --> 45:39.404
WE WERE GOING TO CHANGE
THE WORLD--

45:39.437 --> 45:42.007
THE FIRST GAY SUPERHERO.

45:42.040 --> 45:45.243
[chuckles]

45:45.276 --> 45:47.913
NOW IT'S OVER.

45:55.887 --> 45:58.756
- AND NOW YOU'RE BACK.

46:04.229 --> 46:07.498
IT MUST BE QUITE
A LETDOWN AFTER ALL THAT.

46:11.436 --> 46:13.204
- THERE'S STILL ONE THING
PITTSBURGH HAS

46:13.238 --> 46:15.173
THAT HOLLYWOOD DOESN'T.

46:23.448 --> 46:26.517
THAT IS, IF THE
OFFER STILL STANDS.
