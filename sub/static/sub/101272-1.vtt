00:13.875 --> 00:18.880
[gentle piano music]
[birds chirping]

01:41.308 --> 01:43.241
- I can't be late.

01:43.275 --> 01:44.483
- You won't be.

01:48.453 --> 01:49.178
- What?

01:50.179 --> 01:51.007
- Nothing.

01:52.008 --> 01:53.941
[Pearl giggles]

01:53.975 --> 01:55.667
- I know you love me.

01:58.048 --> 02:01.121
[Pearl giggling]

02:01.155 --> 02:03.640
[gentle music]

02:06.540 --> 02:09.473
[Pearl] I wanna control my
destiny.

02:09.508 --> 02:13.133
- And how do you
envision achieving that?

02:13.167 --> 02:14.789
- I'm going to work hard,

02:14.824 --> 02:16.791
harder than anyone else.

02:16.826 --> 02:18.793
And I'll graduate with honors
and go to Harvard or Yale

02:18.828 --> 02:20.450
with a double major
in political science

02:20.485 --> 02:22.659
and global economics.

02:22.694 --> 02:24.144
I wanna intern at
the UN and one day

02:24.178 --> 02:26.456
be an ambassador to France.

02:26.491 --> 02:27.871
- [Betty] And why
do you think Winston

02:27.906 --> 02:29.977
is a good fit for Pearl?

02:30.011 --> 02:31.875
- A mixture of your
strong academics

02:31.910 --> 02:33.981
and the individual attention
you have for the girls

02:34.015 --> 02:37.157
makes you a wonderful
fit as you would say.

02:37.191 --> 02:39.469
- Well, Pearl is a
magnificent girl.

02:39.504 --> 02:43.301
A 4.4 GPA, eights and
nines on her ISEEs,

02:43.335 --> 02:44.854
an accomplished pianist,

02:44.888 --> 02:48.168
well-liked by her teachers,
popular with her friends.

02:48.202 --> 02:49.169
What's your secret?

02:49.203 --> 02:50.653
- Well, it takes a village.

02:50.687 --> 02:54.001
- A stable home is paramount
in creating Winston girls.

02:54.035 --> 02:55.313
If there's trouble in the house,

02:55.347 --> 02:58.316
there's very little we
can do to overcome it.

02:58.350 --> 02:59.351
Oh, this way.

03:01.698 --> 03:04.701

[dark suspenseful music]

04:03.588 --> 04:05.072
- [Anthony] Oh I'm telling.

04:05.106 --> 04:06.556
What, you think I'm gonna
put up your whoring around?

04:06.591 --> 04:07.419
[rifle firing]

04:07.454 --> 04:08.731
- [Helen] Would you calm down?

04:08.765 --> 04:09.456
- [Anthony] Oh good,
'cause you don't want

04:09.490 --> 04:10.284
a whore, I'm unreal.

04:10.319 --> 04:11.251
- [Helen] Let it be.

04:11.285 --> 04:12.631
- Who was he?
- A guy.

04:12.666 --> 04:13.736
- [Anthony] Oh uh, you go
with the internet guy, right?

04:13.770 --> 04:15.082
[rifle firing]
[Pearl panting]

04:15.116 --> 04:16.255
- I wasn't with that guy.
- You fucked him!

04:16.290 --> 04:17.394
Now get away from--
[tense music]

04:17.428 --> 04:18.637
- [Anthony] No, you
fucked him, didn't ya?

04:18.672 --> 04:19.430
You fucked that
British guy Simon too.

04:19.466 --> 04:20.915
- I fucked 'em all

04:20.950 --> 04:23.090
because I need a man not a crazy drunk, emotional cripple.

04:23.124 --> 04:24.574
[rifle firing]

04:24.609 --> 04:25.748
[shell casing clattering]

04:25.782 --> 04:27.991
- Mom, Anthony?
[suspenseful music]

04:37.967 --> 04:41.281
[rifle clacking]

04:41.315 --> 04:42.282
[gasps] No.

04:45.630 --> 04:46.941
No.

[suspenseful music]
[door clattering and creaking]

05:20.354 --> 05:21.321
- Oh my God.

05:24.013 --> 05:26.671
[Pearl crying]

05:48.382 --> 05:52.386
[police radio chattering]

05:52.421 --> 05:54.940
- [Officer] Were they married?

05:55.872 --> 05:56.701
- What?

05:57.943 --> 05:59.704
- We're they married?

06:04.260 --> 06:06.711
[Eve crying]

06:10.784 --> 06:13.614

[somber music]

06:32.461 --> 06:35.774
[keys jangling]

06:35.809 --> 06:37.466
- Come on, Grandma.

06:38.432 --> 06:39.537
Let me help you up.

06:39.571 --> 06:40.400
Come on.

06:50.271 --> 06:52.998
[engine revving]

06:57.486 --> 07:00.350

[phone ringing]

07:40.874 --> 07:43.532
[Jack groaning]

07:47.984 --> 07:49.883
- That was a new trick.

07:51.643 --> 07:52.679
- [Isaac] Jack Wolf?
- Yeah.

07:52.713 --> 07:54.197
- It's Isaac Robbins.

07:54.232 --> 07:57.822
We met years ago when you
were seeing Helen Rosen.

07:58.823 --> 07:59.548
- Right.

08:00.825 --> 08:01.826
You were um,

08:03.344 --> 08:04.518
her pal, a lawyer.

08:04.553 --> 08:06.796
- [Isaac] You sort of
swept her off her feet.

08:06.831 --> 08:08.177
- Yeah, it was mutual.

08:08.211 --> 08:11.663
- [Isaac] I'm
representing her estate.

08:11.698 --> 08:14.355
- [grunts] Her estate?

08:14.390 --> 08:16.668
- [Isaac] She's dead.

08:16.703 --> 08:18.877
She was killed last night.

08:20.223 --> 08:21.535
I'm sorry, Jack.

08:22.916 --> 08:26.195
- What do you mean killed,
how was she killed?

08:26.229 --> 08:28.162
- [Isaac] The funeral's Friday.

08:28.197 --> 08:30.371
Mountainview in Altadena, 10:00.

08:30.406 --> 08:32.650
I thought you'd wanna be there.

08:32.683 --> 08:35.653
- Do you know I haven't seen
her for many, many years.

08:35.687 --> 08:39.241
- [Isaac] It's important
that you be there.

08:41.037 --> 08:44.006
[Jack grunts]

08:44.039 --> 08:46.387
[Jack sighs]

08:52.048 --> 08:54.395
- You have to eat something.

09:02.611 --> 09:06.718
That policeman asked if
I was angry at my mother.

09:08.306 --> 09:10.722
- I don't know what happened.

09:13.242 --> 09:14.968
- They were fighting.

09:17.418 --> 09:19.559
And then Anthony shot Mom.

09:20.421 --> 09:22.492
And then he shot himself.

09:24.598 --> 09:26.566
- She shoulda...

09:26.600 --> 09:28.084
She can't be gone.

09:30.259 --> 09:32.123
She can't be gone.

09:32.157 --> 09:33.573
It's not possible.
[somber music]

09:36.265 --> 09:38.094
- I'm so sorry, Nana.

09:39.786 --> 09:41.132
- [Nana] I know.

09:48.518 --> 09:51.832
[gentle Parisian music]

09:59.840 --> 10:03.119
[police siren wailing]

10:04.500 --> 10:07.296
[engine revving]

10:10.782 --> 10:11.645
[car clattering]

10:11.680 --> 10:12.957
- Fuck!

10:12.991 --> 10:15.269
What the hell are you doing?

10:15.304 --> 10:16.443
- You just pulled out.
- You just come screaming

10:16.477 --> 10:17.168
down the street.
- You didn't even look.

10:17.202 --> 10:18.618
You have to look

10:18.652 --> 10:19.515
before you pull out.
- Could've killed somebody.

10:19.549 --> 10:20.447
- Look what you did to my car.

10:20.481 --> 10:21.448
- What I did to your car?

10:21.482 --> 10:23.484
What the fuck you did to my car?

10:27.005 --> 10:28.835
- I, I didn't see you.

10:29.801 --> 10:31.458
[sighs] I was upset--

10:31.492 --> 10:32.632
- No one lived.

10:32.666 --> 10:33.667
I don't think I was focused.

10:33.702 --> 10:34.944
I wasn't concentrating here.

10:34.979 --> 10:36.187
- No, it's my fault.

10:36.221 --> 10:37.464
I was speeding and I
wasn't paying attention

10:37.498 --> 10:39.777
and then suddenly
you were just there.

10:39.811 --> 10:42.331
[both sighing]

10:43.988 --> 10:44.989
Are you okay?

10:46.404 --> 10:47.198
- Yeah.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.477
You're American?

10:50.511 --> 10:51.512
- Obviously.

10:52.997 --> 10:54.964
- So what were you upset about?

10:54.999 --> 10:57.208
- [scoffs] My
husband just left me

10:57.242 --> 10:58.381
and I think it's my fault.

10:58.416 --> 10:59.486
I mean, I know it's my fault.

10:59.520 --> 11:00.211
- [Jack] Oh.

11:00.245 --> 11:01.143
- Helen.

11:01.177 --> 11:03.248
- Oh, uh, Jack, Jack Wolf.

11:07.183 --> 11:08.012
- I uh...

11:09.703 --> 11:10.531
Here.

11:11.532 --> 11:13.224
For insurance.

11:13.258 --> 11:14.501
- Right.

11:14.535 --> 11:17.815
Well, you know, it's
probably for the best.

11:17.849 --> 11:19.989
[police siren wailing]

11:20.024 --> 11:21.163
Your breakup.

11:21.197 --> 11:22.336
- Oh!

11:22.371 --> 11:24.407
That's what they always say.

11:24.442 --> 11:27.169
- Oh, I'm not so
sure about that.

11:27.203 --> 11:29.171
- Should I give you my number,

11:29.205 --> 11:30.034
I mean, for the car?
- Do you wanna,

11:30.068 --> 11:31.242
do you wanna have a drink?

11:31.276 --> 11:32.519
- What, you think I need one?

11:32.553 --> 11:34.901
- [chuckles] I know I do.

11:34.935 --> 11:36.350
- Uh [sighs].

11:36.385 --> 11:37.869
- I know, I,

11:37.904 --> 11:39.250
look I know you don't,

11:39.284 --> 11:40.009
[sighs] you don't know me
[gentle music]

11:40.044 --> 11:41.183
so I--

11:41.217 --> 11:42.840
- No, I know, I mean,
I don't know you

11:42.874 --> 11:45.049
but I can see you're kind.

11:50.295 --> 11:52.712
I don't belong here.

11:52.746 --> 11:54.023
I'm from LA.

11:54.058 --> 11:54.852
- Me too.

11:54.886 --> 11:56.094
West Hollywood.

11:57.578 --> 11:58.752
- Oh.

11:58.787 --> 12:00.720
I wanna go home.

12:00.754 --> 12:02.583
- I'll take you.

12:02.618 --> 12:03.446
I will.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.380
- We just met.

12:06.415 --> 12:08.797
- [Jack] How long were
you and Michele together?

12:11.075 --> 12:12.766
- [Helen] Seven years.

12:12.801 --> 12:14.734
- [Jack] Do you
think he knew you?

12:14.768 --> 12:15.596
- No.

12:17.909 --> 12:19.048
You married?

12:19.083 --> 12:20.394
- Mmm nnn.

12:20.429 --> 12:21.775
- Divorced?

12:21.810 --> 12:23.121
- Never married.

12:24.260 --> 12:26.884
- But you've been in love?

12:26.918 --> 12:27.747
- Uh...

12:30.646 --> 12:31.612
Yeah, once.

12:32.682 --> 12:36.238
- [sniffles] What was she like?

12:36.272 --> 12:37.757
- She was curious,

12:39.793 --> 12:40.829
smart, funny.

12:43.279 --> 12:44.073
- [Helen] She sounds sexy.

12:44.108 --> 12:45.247
- [Jack] Mmm hmm.

12:45.281 --> 12:47.767
- [Helen] Where is she?

12:47.801 --> 12:48.940
- Um, she's uh,

12:51.115 --> 12:52.495
she's right here.

12:54.290 --> 12:56.120
Yeah, she's right here.

13:07.131 --> 13:09.789
[food sizzling]

13:11.652 --> 13:12.792
- Oh.

13:12.826 --> 13:14.276
- [Pearl] Why
aren't you dressed?

13:14.310 --> 13:15.277
- I'm not going.

13:15.311 --> 13:16.623
- What do you mean?

13:16.657 --> 13:17.624
- [Eve] Enough.

13:17.658 --> 13:18.625
- You have to go!

13:18.659 --> 13:19.453
It's your daughter's funeral!

13:19.488 --> 13:20.523
- I'm not going!

13:20.558 --> 13:21.524
- You have to go, Nana!

13:21.559 --> 13:22.836
- My daughter is dead.

13:22.871 --> 13:24.493
What difference does it make?

13:24.527 --> 13:26.460
- You can't not go!

13:26.495 --> 13:29.360
[doorbell ringing]

13:30.982 --> 13:31.811
- Hi.

13:32.708 --> 13:34.365
You must be Pearl.

13:34.399 --> 13:36.298
I'm Isaac, Isaac Robbins.

13:36.332 --> 13:40.820
I'm an attorney and an old
friend of your mother's.

13:40.854 --> 13:43.063
I'm so sorry for your loss.

13:44.893 --> 13:45.894
- Thank you.

13:47.999 --> 13:49.656
- Well, I have a car
waiting to take you

13:49.690 --> 13:50.553
to the service.

13:50.588 --> 13:51.831
- Oh!

13:51.865 --> 13:54.557
This is all simply
too much to bear.

13:57.388 --> 13:59.321
[door clattering]

13:59.355 --> 14:00.874
[door thudding]

14:00.909 --> 14:03.704
- Did you know my
mother a long time?

14:03.739 --> 14:04.567
- Yes.

14:05.914 --> 14:07.087
I admired her.

14:10.366 --> 14:12.196
- Did you know my dad?

14:13.887 --> 14:14.715
- No.

14:17.063 --> 14:19.410
- He died before I was born.

14:24.933 --> 14:26.279
I'll go get her.

14:27.936 --> 14:30.904
[people chattering]

14:33.942 --> 14:36.392
[Eve crying]

14:40.224 --> 14:41.708
- [Man] I hear it's pretty good.

14:41.742 --> 14:43.883
- [Man] An old friend of yours.

14:43.917 --> 14:45.919
- [Woman] Hi, thought
you'd never make it.

14:45.954 --> 14:47.196
- [Isaac] Jack.

14:47.231 --> 14:48.094
- [Man] You got
a telephone here?

14:48.128 --> 14:49.440
- [Isaac] Been a long time.

14:49.474 --> 14:50.303
- Yeah.

14:51.407 --> 14:52.443
It has, um...

14:53.616 --> 14:55.929
Look, I appreciate
the invitation

14:55.964 --> 14:57.448
but I don't understand.

14:57.482 --> 14:58.898

have to say over the phone

14:58.932 --> 15:00.071
and there was no time.

15:27.098 --> 15:28.410
- How long have you had this?

15:28.444 --> 15:30.757
- I just opened her safe
deposit box yesterday.

15:30.791 --> 15:32.759
- Yeah, but it's
addressed to you.

15:32.793 --> 15:34.934

My mom was one of three

17:31.567 --> 17:35.882
and I've always wanted
a brother and a sister.

To be honest,

19:07.318 --> 19:09.631
I don't understand what

never opened that letter.

Do you get that?

- [Jack] Mmm hmm.

19:13.186 --> 19:14.325
- Okay.

19:14.360 --> 19:16.293
Helen left her entire
estate to her killer.

19:16.327 --> 19:17.984
We can get around that.

19:18.018 --> 19:21.056
But his family might contest
it and tie it up for years.

19:21.919 --> 19:22.989
- No, anger.

19:23.023 --> 19:24.163
- What are they angry about?

19:24.197 --> 19:25.992

they feel guilty.

- [chuckles] Helen never
told me anything about this.

19:41.387 --> 19:43.043
For all I know she
could be your daughter.

19:43.078 --> 19:45.218
- I was not Helen's lover.

19:46.875 --> 19:48.497
Can you support Pearl?

19:48.532 --> 19:49.671
- [Jack] I haven't even met her.

19:49.705 --> 19:51.017
- Do the math.

19:51.051 --> 19:52.674
Why would she choose
you if it weren't true?

19:52.708 --> 19:54.123

19:57.541 --> 19:59.405
Is that Helen's mother?

His family doesn't want
that girl to see a penny.

had money put away.

20:20.909 --> 20:22.221
You know, just in case.

20:22.255 --> 20:23.877
She was too smart not to.

20:23.912 --> 20:24.706
- I have no idea.

- You were her lawyer.

was a very wealthy man.

it could happen?

can't take care of you.

Siegel and her parents.

responsibility.

they would foster you?

do you do here?

Essays, journals.

24:56.425 --> 24:58.358
- [Pearl] Do you sell anything?

24:58.393 --> 25:00.326
- I have sold things
from time to time

25:00.360 --> 25:01.810
but mostly I write for myself.

[kettle whistling]

25:12.027 --> 25:12.856
- Thanks.

25:19.379 --> 25:20.380
Are you my father?

25:20.415 --> 25:21.830
- Why would you ask me that?

25:21.865 --> 25:23.660
- You were dating my mother
when she got pregnant.

25:23.694 --> 25:24.902
- [Jack] She didn't tell
me she was pregnant.

25:24.937 --> 25:29.044
- [scoffs] You're
not sure, are you?

25:29.079 --> 25:31.219
What if you're my father?

25:44.404 --> 25:45.578
You could be my father.

25:45.613 --> 25:47.028
- You don't want me
to be your father.

25:47.062 --> 25:47.891
- No.

25:50.238 --> 25:51.860
- So what do you want?

25:51.895 --> 25:53.413
- Kate Siegel is my best
friend and her parents

25:53.448 --> 25:54.863
want to adopt me.

25:54.898 --> 25:56.589
Her dad's the head of
a big talent agency.

25:56.624 --> 25:58.384
- What, Marty Siegel?

25:58.418 --> 25:59.868
- [Pearl] You know him?

25:59.903 --> 26:02.595
- Um, he's one of the top
agents in TV packaging

26:02.630 --> 26:03.907
in Los Angeles.

26:05.080 --> 26:08.049
- [Pearl] It's
what's best for me.

26:08.083 --> 26:09.222
- Why?

26:09.257 --> 26:10.879
- The Siegels know everyone.

26:10.914 --> 26:13.882
They go everywhere, stay
at the very best places.

26:13.917 --> 26:15.746
They would protect me.

26:17.092 --> 26:19.612
This is how my mom
would've raised me.

26:19.647 --> 26:22.097
So my thought is if
you're my legal guardian,

26:22.132 --> 26:24.893
you could say I'm meant
to be living with them.

26:24.928 --> 26:28.241
- Does your grandmother
know about this?

26:28.276 --> 26:29.967
She's not on board
with this, is she?

26:30.002 --> 26:31.072
She wants you to live with her.

26:31.106 --> 26:31.935
- I can't.

26:33.108 --> 26:34.247
- [Jack] You could
take care of her.

26:34.282 --> 26:36.249
- I love her but I can't.

26:36.284 --> 26:38.148
[Jack sighs]

26:38.182 --> 26:41.323
- Did Robbins give
you my address?

26:41.358 --> 26:42.601
Oh, and you thought
it was better

26:42.635 --> 26:46.328
to just come here rather
than call me first.

26:46.363 --> 26:47.951
[Jack sighing]

26:47.985 --> 26:50.332
You see the letter?

26:50.367 --> 26:52.162
- He showed me a copy.

26:52.196 --> 26:54.302
- [Jack] And you still
think I'm your father?

26:54.336 --> 26:55.614
- Does it matter?

26:55.648 --> 26:57.650
You don't want a kid and
I have somewhere to go.

26:57.685 --> 26:58.927
- Wow.

26:58.962 --> 27:00.619
Practical girl.

27:00.653 --> 27:01.827
- [Pearl] All you have to do

27:01.861 --> 27:03.276
is have a paternity
test and claim me.

27:03.311 --> 27:05.934
- And hand you over
to the Siegels?

27:05.969 --> 27:07.833
- I'm sure they'd
be appreciative.

27:07.867 --> 27:10.352
Maybe he can help
you find a job.

27:10.387 --> 27:12.320
[Jack chuckling]

27:12.354 --> 27:13.493
What?

27:13.528 --> 27:14.805
Why shouldn't you
benefit from helping me?

27:14.840 --> 27:17.118
- Jesus, how old are you?

27:17.152 --> 27:20.017
- Do this for my
mom who you loved.

27:21.156 --> 27:23.642
[Pearl sighs]

27:27.680 --> 27:29.993
Just sign this for me please.

27:31.511 --> 27:32.789
It says you're my
guardian and you agree

27:32.823 --> 27:34.135
my life would be
better if I lived

27:34.169 --> 27:36.516

[Jack groans]

27:51.014 --> 27:51.808

27:51.842 --> 27:53.395
- This is what I want.

27:53.430 --> 27:55.397
- I'm pretty sure
I'm not your father.

27:55.432 --> 27:58.090
- My grandmother's an alcoholic.

28:01.749 --> 28:04.199
[Jack sighs]

28:16.902 --> 28:17.730
Thank you.

28:22.045 --> 28:22.873
- Pearl.

28:25.738 --> 28:26.566
Good luck.

28:27.740 --> 28:29.190
- You too.

28:29.224 --> 28:32.572
[gentle Parisian music]

28:40.580 --> 28:43.411
[camera clicking]

28:45.620 --> 28:48.416
[swans quacking]

28:52.282 --> 28:55.112
[camera clicking]

28:58.771 --> 29:02.602
[speaking in foreign language]

29:07.642 --> 29:10.265
[Jack grunts]

29:10.300 --> 29:12.751
- I think I got a crush on you.

29:12.785 --> 29:13.924
- I know.

29:13.959 --> 29:16.237
- Oh, you're pretty
cocky, aren't you?

29:16.271 --> 29:18.929
[Jack chuckles]

29:20.310 --> 29:22.968
[Jack groaning]

29:27.110 --> 29:27.938
Oh.

29:32.287 --> 29:34.945
[Jack grunting]

29:42.850 --> 29:45.818
- [Eve] I can't believe
you found that loser.

29:45.853 --> 29:47.095
It'll never hold up in court.

29:47.130 --> 29:48.787
- My mom wanted him
to be my guardian.

29:48.821 --> 29:51.134
He's my father and he
gave his permission.

29:51.168 --> 29:53.136
- He's not your father.

29:54.033 --> 29:54.827
It doesn't matter.

29:54.862 --> 29:55.724
- Why?

29:57.657 --> 29:59.659
- Because the Siegels
don't want you.

29:59.694 --> 30:00.971
- Yes, they do.

30:01.834 --> 30:04.112
- I spoke to the mother, Bunny.

30:04.147 --> 30:05.113
- Sunny.

30:05.148 --> 30:06.218
She loves me.

30:07.875 --> 30:11.810
- They feel that you need
special care right now.

30:11.844 --> 30:15.952
Given the exigencies of
Martin's responsibilities

30:15.986 --> 30:17.160
at the agency,

30:18.506 --> 30:20.301
the household couldn't really
[gentle music]

30:20.335 --> 30:24.477
withstand the changes that
taking on another child,

30:24.512 --> 30:26.997
especially one with
special needs would bring.

30:27.032 --> 30:28.343
- You're lying.

30:32.209 --> 30:33.176
[tense music]

30:33.210 --> 30:34.039
[phone beeping]

30:34.073 --> 30:34.867
Call Kay.

30:38.181 --> 30:39.182
- [Kate] Yo, it's Kate.

30:39.216 --> 30:40.010
You know what to do.

30:40.045 --> 30:40.873
[phone beeps]

30:40.908 --> 30:42.254
- Please call me.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.986
- Face it, kiddo.

30:50.020 --> 30:51.263
I'm all you got.

31:03.378 --> 31:04.172
[door clattering]

31:04.207 --> 31:06.865
[food sizzling]

31:09.557 --> 31:11.697
- Don't you lock your door?

31:11.731 --> 31:12.560
- No.

31:15.045 --> 31:16.909
- My grandmother poisoned
their minds against me.

31:16.944 --> 31:18.393
- Who?

31:18.428 --> 31:20.085
The Siegels?

31:20.119 --> 31:21.707
Marty Siegel?

31:21.741 --> 31:24.020
- They don't want me.

31:24.054 --> 31:24.883
- [Jack] He's an asshole.

31:24.917 --> 31:26.712
- No, he's not.

31:26.746 --> 31:27.575
- Yeah.

31:28.576 --> 31:29.888
He's an asshole.

31:31.406 --> 31:32.200
- [Pearl] Can I stay here?

31:32.235 --> 31:33.615
- No.

31:33.650 --> 31:34.893
- Just until I can reach
Kate and straighten this out.

31:34.927 --> 31:35.894
- No.

31:35.928 --> 31:37.033
- You don't have
to be my father.

31:37.067 --> 31:38.206
- If I'm not your
father, then I'm guilty

31:38.241 --> 31:39.552
of kidnapping a minor.

31:39.587 --> 31:40.726
- No one would prosecute you.

31:40.760 --> 31:42.279
- Your grandmother.

31:46.939 --> 31:48.389
[phone beeps]

31:48.423 --> 31:49.769
- Hey, Mr. Robbins.

31:49.804 --> 31:51.047
Pearl Rosen.

31:51.081 --> 31:52.565
Can you talk with my dad

31:52.600 --> 31:54.291
or the guy who might be my dad.

31:54.326 --> 31:55.741
I need to assure him
he won't go to prison

31:55.775 --> 31:58.951
if I crash on his
couch for a few days.

32:00.780 --> 32:01.747
Oh.

32:01.781 --> 32:02.817
I'm actually here right now.

32:02.851 --> 32:04.577
- Nope.
- One second.

32:04.612 --> 32:06.786
- I don't wanna talk to...

32:08.512 --> 32:11.274
[Jack grunts]

32:11.308 --> 32:12.137
Yeah.

32:15.105 --> 32:18.143
Yeah, but I'm not her father.

32:18.177 --> 32:21.525
Yeah, without my
knowledge 15 years ago.

32:23.113 --> 32:23.942
Uh huh.

32:25.357 --> 32:30.258
Well, I'm still not gonna
say that I'm her father.

32:30.293 --> 32:31.466
Yeah, you too.

32:36.126 --> 32:38.542
- You have that old
sports car, don't you?

32:41.028 --> 32:43.685
[door thudding]

32:44.721 --> 32:47.966
[distant dog barking]

32:48.000 --> 32:50.347
- Come back here,
you little thief!

32:50.382 --> 32:52.004
I know you took my money!

32:52.039 --> 32:53.454
- I didn't take your money!

32:53.488 --> 32:54.662
- Help me!
- It's my money.

32:54.696 --> 32:56.284
- I'm being robbed!
- She seems upset.

32:56.319 --> 32:57.285
- Police!

32:57.320 --> 32:59.011
- Call you tomorrow, Nana.

32:59.046 --> 33:00.288
Go.

33:00.323 --> 33:02.808
- Come back here with
my child, you crook,

33:02.842 --> 33:04.879
you goddamn crook.

33:04.913 --> 33:07.502
[gentle music]

33:39.879 --> 33:40.880
- I love you.

33:42.882 --> 33:44.056
[people chattering]

33:44.091 --> 33:44.919
- What?

33:46.058 --> 33:46.886
- Nothin'.

33:48.233 --> 33:50.718
[Jack laughing]

33:50.752 --> 33:52.030
- I make you happy.

33:52.064 --> 33:52.892
- Yeah.

34:01.384 --> 34:02.937
[Jack groans]

34:02.971 --> 34:04.870
- [Pearl] When will
you know the results?

34:04.904 --> 34:05.698
- I'm not sure.

34:05.733 --> 34:07.045
Next week maybe.

34:10.219 --> 34:11.911
- Where are you gonna sleep?

34:11.946 --> 34:14.085
- Downstairs on the couch.

34:15.225 --> 34:16.192
I sleep there often.

34:16.226 --> 34:17.054
It's fine.

34:17.089 --> 34:19.228
[metal clanking]

34:19.264 --> 34:20.368
- What's that?

34:20.402 --> 34:21.989
- It's the mailbox.

34:23.820 --> 34:25.201
Mail comes through
right in the house.

34:25.235 --> 34:26.098
It's, uh...

34:28.411 --> 34:29.274
old school.

34:52.297 --> 34:54.782
[Jack sighs]

34:56.784 --> 34:57.612
Pearl.

35:00.512 --> 35:02.100
This one's for you.

35:08.796 --> 35:11.868
[footsteps clacking]

35:17.839 --> 35:20.463
[gentle music]

35:37.307 --> 35:39.137
[gentle knocking]

35:39.171 --> 35:39.999
Pearl.

35:45.004 --> 35:47.662
[Pearl crying]

35:51.494 --> 35:54.013
[tense music]

36:02.919 --> 36:03.989
Hi.

36:04.023 --> 36:05.818
I'm Jack Wolf and this is Pearl

36:05.853 --> 36:09.546
and I was wondering if we
could see Ms. Whetstone.

36:09.581 --> 36:10.996
- Is she expecting you?

36:11.030 --> 36:11.824
- We don't have an appointment
but it's important.

36:11.859 --> 36:14.206
[door clattering]

36:14.241 --> 36:15.483
Sorry to barge in.

36:15.518 --> 36:17.554
- No, no, please come in.

36:23.388 --> 36:25.838
Mr. Robbins called.

36:25.873 --> 36:30.705
And may I say how terribly
sorry we all are for your loss.

36:30.740 --> 36:32.224
- Thank you.

36:32.259 --> 36:34.364
- How are you feeling, Pearl?

36:34.399 --> 36:36.021
- I'm okay, thank you.

36:36.055 --> 36:37.022
- You know, under
the circumstances

36:37.056 --> 36:39.680
she's doing incredibly well.

36:39.714 --> 36:43.511
- Mr. Robbins explained that
you're her birth father.

36:43.546 --> 36:44.409
- Yeah.

36:46.549 --> 36:50.380
I only recently came
into Pearl's life.

36:50.415 --> 36:52.865
- And you're here to
discuss the letter.

36:52.900 --> 36:55.523
- No, I wanted to tell you
that there's no problem

36:55.558 --> 36:57.076
on paying the tuition,

36:57.111 --> 36:57.905
full-time.
- Mr. Wolf,

36:57.939 --> 36:59.424
it's not about money.

36:59.458 --> 37:02.599
- But my grades, my
community service.

37:03.566 --> 37:04.532
- I'm going to be frank.

37:04.567 --> 37:05.395
- Please.

37:06.948 --> 37:09.227
- Despite our
reputation for rigor,

37:09.261 --> 37:11.608
we want our girls to succeed.

37:11.643 --> 37:15.578
And Pearl has gone through
an incredible trauma.

37:15.612 --> 37:17.269
We felt the Winston program

37:17.304 --> 37:18.788
would only add to her stress.

37:18.822 --> 37:19.961
- [Jack] Don't you
think that's a question

37:19.996 --> 37:21.411
you should ask
Pearl or her family?

37:21.446 --> 37:25.588
- Honestly, we felt your
plate was terribly full.

37:26.934 --> 37:30.731
I know how disappointing
this must be for you, Pearl,

37:30.765 --> 37:34.390
but I sincerely believe that
this is what's best for you

37:34.424 --> 37:35.460
at this time.

37:36.461 --> 37:37.462
- Please.

37:37.496 --> 37:38.601
- I am sorry.

37:40.292 --> 37:42.260
- I don't think you are.

37:43.468 --> 37:44.296
Pearl.

37:51.441 --> 37:52.270
[door clattering]

37:52.304 --> 37:53.409
Can I come in?

37:53.443 --> 37:54.755
- You need to ask before
you open the door.

37:54.789 --> 37:56.274
- Oh, I'm sorry.

37:56.308 --> 37:57.102
You busy?

37:57.136 --> 37:58.310
- [Pearl] Yeah.

37:58.345 --> 37:59.311
- Well, put a pin
in your social media

37:59.346 --> 38:00.105
'cause we need to talk.

38:00.139 --> 38:00.933
- No, we don't.

38:00.968 --> 38:02.107
- Yeah.

38:02.141 --> 38:03.108
I'm sorry about Winston.

38:03.142 --> 38:04.420
- Go away!

38:04.454 --> 38:05.455
- We need to talk
about your school.

38:05.490 --> 38:06.491
- Winston is my school.

38:06.525 --> 38:07.837
- I've enrolled you into JB.

38:07.871 --> 38:09.114
- What's that?

38:09.148 --> 38:10.322
- John Burrows, it's
a local public school.

38:10.357 --> 38:11.289
- I'm not going
to public school!

38:11.323 --> 38:12.773
- Yeah, you are.

38:12.807 --> 38:13.946
You are going to public
school at least for this term.

38:13.981 --> 38:14.775
- You can't stop me!

38:14.809 --> 38:15.948
Winston is my school!

38:15.983 --> 38:17.122
I'm not going there!

38:17.156 --> 38:18.123
- It's not your fucking
school now, is it?

38:18.157 --> 38:19.297
- God, I hate you!

38:19.331 --> 38:21.816
It shoulda been you that died!

38:28.375 --> 38:30.825
[Jack sighs]

38:32.344 --> 38:35.071
- I know that you
don't trust me.

38:39.731 --> 38:42.837
But it's the best
I can do right now.

38:44.667 --> 38:48.843
It's gonna be okay.
[gentle music]

38:49.844 --> 38:52.260
[Jack sighs]

38:54.849 --> 38:57.162
- [Pearl] Why didn't
you tell me about him?

38:57.196 --> 39:00.993
He had a father and a
mother but they're all gone.

39:01.028 --> 39:04.342
She was pretty with
red hair like mine.

39:06.274 --> 39:08.035
He looks like his dad

39:09.277 --> 39:10.589
with those ears.

39:14.041 --> 39:16.871
Are all those people
related to me?

39:20.047 --> 39:23.050
My God, where did
he get those ears?

39:28.573 --> 39:29.401
- Do you want me to come in?

39:29.436 --> 39:30.678
- No.

39:30.713 --> 39:33.888
- Not even to say
hi to the principal?

39:36.408 --> 39:37.582
All right, I'll pick
you up after school.

39:37.616 --> 39:39.100
- We live six blocks away.

39:39.135 --> 39:41.862
Go write or whatever you do.

39:41.896 --> 39:42.725
- Okay.

39:49.421 --> 39:51.285
- So library's over there.

39:51.319 --> 39:52.700
[people chattering]

39:52.735 --> 39:54.875
And then the science building's
next to the parking lot.

39:54.909 --> 39:56.532
You can smoke there.

39:56.566 --> 39:57.912
- I don't smoke.

39:59.983 --> 40:01.399
- What are you lookin' at?

40:01.433 --> 40:03.401
- You I guess.

40:03.435 --> 40:05.437
- Don't be lookin' at me.

40:05.472 --> 40:07.405
Don't you ever be lookin' at me.

40:07.439 --> 40:08.613
- I thought you
were looking at me.

40:08.647 --> 40:12.548
- [chuckles] Why would
I be lookin' at you?

40:12.582 --> 40:13.756
- I don't know.

40:13.790 --> 40:15.723
I didn't wanna be
rude by looking away.

40:15.758 --> 40:18.416
- You didn't wanna be rude.
[girls chuckling]

40:18.450 --> 40:20.452
So you stare right at me?

40:20.487 --> 40:21.315
- I'm Pearl.

40:21.349 --> 40:22.350
- She's new.

40:23.662 --> 40:25.906
- Are you here for the
Special Ed program?

40:25.940 --> 40:27.425
[girls giggling]

40:27.459 --> 40:29.461
Are you special?

40:29.496 --> 40:31.429
- No, just trying
to be friendly.

40:31.463 --> 40:33.154
- Okay, we should go.

40:34.501 --> 40:37.918
- You're an interesting
girl, Perlita.

40:37.952 --> 40:39.126
- So are you.

40:39.160 --> 40:39.954
- Silvia.

40:41.128 --> 40:43.302
- That's a beautiful name.

40:49.654 --> 40:53.036
- [Student] Are you
brave or just stupid?

40:56.488 --> 40:57.765
[people chattering]
[rain pattering]

40:57.800 --> 41:01.148
- So how come a big-time
Hollywood director

41:01.182 --> 41:02.770
wants to teach
Film Directing One

41:02.805 --> 41:04.841
at an art school?

41:04.876 --> 41:06.291
- I just wanted to teach.

41:06.325 --> 41:07.119
- Uh huh.

41:07.154 --> 41:08.604
