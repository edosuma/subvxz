00:15.100 --> 00:16.560
Right before the Chuseok holidays...

00:16.560 --> 00:18.890
I'm sorry I was late.
There was heavy traffic.

00:18.890 --> 00:21.190
No, it's fine. You picked me up
when I had just gotten out.

00:21.440 --> 00:24.360
Hey, my cousin got married pretty late.

00:24.360 --> 00:26.240
So everyone at the wedding cried.

00:26.240 --> 00:28.370
And my mother wanted to pack up
some food from the buffet.

00:28.370 --> 00:30.900
Look at all this food she packed for me.
My goodness.

00:31.170 --> 00:34.700
This sure makes us feel
like normal people, doesn't it?

00:34.770 --> 00:36.810
I went to a wedding on Saturday.

00:36.810 --> 00:39.910
And we're stuck downtown
in the middle of a congested road.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.310
It'd be perfect
if only we weren't headed to a prison.

00:42.310 --> 00:44.420
Seoul Tollgate announced
that cars leaving Seoul...

00:44.420 --> 00:47.120
Hey. How do office workers
wear ties every day?

00:47.120 --> 00:48.790
This is so suffocating.

00:48.790 --> 00:50.400
And the Honam Expressway...

00:50.400 --> 00:53.160
Gosh. Maybe, I should have brought
some clothes to change into.

00:53.500 --> 00:56.030
Do you want to switch shoes at least?

00:56.040 --> 00:58.330
No, it's okay.
By tonight...

00:58.330 --> 00:59.960
Do you want some rice cakes?
What?

01:00.440 --> 01:02.040
Open your mouth.
I'm good.

01:02.040 --> 01:04.140
Open up.
It's expected to take longer.

01:04.140 --> 01:06.140
There. Chew it.
Hello, everyone.

01:06.340 --> 01:07.970
Yes. That's it.

01:08.840 --> 01:10.070
Let's go.

01:12.580 --> 01:15.110
(Seoul Detention Center)

01:15.610 --> 01:17.390
Gosh. Isn't it nice?
Gosh.

01:17.390 --> 01:19.230
It does look big and nice.

01:19.230 --> 01:20.690
I spent two months' salary on this.

01:20.690 --> 01:22.120
It better look fancy.

01:22.390 --> 01:24.450
You're spending more than you're earning.

01:24.920 --> 01:26.620
You need the right tools
to put your skills to use.

01:26.970 --> 01:29.360
Hey, this kind of looks lame.

01:29.440 --> 01:30.470
I'll put it away.

01:30.470 --> 01:32.630
But I'm more comfortable with it.
Let me use it.

01:32.810 --> 01:34.300
You want to?
Yes.

01:34.310 --> 01:36.230
Okay, it's all yours.
Thank you.

01:36.230 --> 01:37.900
All right. Hold on.

01:38.540 --> 01:39.800
This should be...

01:40.480 --> 01:44.170
Should we put this here?

01:45.250 --> 01:46.690
(Keep quiet)

01:46.690 --> 01:48.480
Inmate 4709, you have visitors.

01:52.590 --> 01:53.720
Who's here?

01:57.290 --> 01:59.890
Look at him dusting off
his feet again. Gosh.

01:59.890 --> 02:02.360
That fool.
Just go, will you?

02:02.370 --> 02:03.940
Idiot.
Gosh, seriously.

02:03.940 --> 02:05.260
(Do not flush leftovers down the toilet.)

02:05.260 --> 02:08.699
Hurry up. The officer is waiting.
Goodness.

02:08.699 --> 02:10.169
Gosh, that fool.

02:10.229 --> 02:12.540
I'm sorry, man.
What? What the...

02:12.540 --> 02:14.140
You can't blindside me like this.

02:14.140 --> 02:16.510
I can't even stand the way he walks.

02:16.840 --> 02:18.940
Goodness.
That idiot.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.510
What's with him?

02:39.340 --> 02:43.430
Well, we're not here to interrogate you,
so relax.

02:43.780 --> 02:46.070
Did you put on a suit to meet me?

02:48.180 --> 02:49.310
Why do you ask?

02:51.590 --> 02:53.380
I feel special.

03:01.960 --> 03:03.720
But it's all over now, isn't it?

03:04.750 --> 03:06.490
Do you think it's over?

03:07.030 --> 03:08.120
You caught me.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.130
Mr. Cho, we still have...

03:10.130 --> 03:11.710
many questions for you.

03:11.710 --> 03:13.760
But I told you everything last time.

03:14.470 --> 03:16.340
That lady too. I told her everything.

03:16.340 --> 03:19.040
She is a detective, not a "lady."

03:20.340 --> 03:24.140
We want to hear more about you,
not about the case.

03:24.620 --> 03:26.310
You could tell us about your childhood...

03:26.380 --> 03:29.380
or how you feel.
Feel free to tell us anything.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.360
It's just for our record,
so don't worry about it.

03:38.690 --> 03:39.820
Right.

03:41.220 --> 03:44.630
Well... Is there anything
you'd like to tell us?

03:45.130 --> 03:48.670
It's okay. You can tell us anything.

03:48.710 --> 03:52.170
You're not interrogating me,
but you want to hear my story?

03:53.100 --> 03:56.410
That's right.
No one wants to hear my story.

03:57.050 --> 03:59.240
What's your reason?
We visited your place.

04:00.090 --> 04:01.690
My place?

04:01.690 --> 04:03.250
Yes, it was very clean.

04:03.250 --> 04:05.320
Everything was neatly organized,

04:05.720 --> 04:07.380
even your socks.

04:08.030 --> 04:09.550
I don't like it when things are messy.

04:10.930 --> 04:12.020
I know.

04:14.500 --> 04:17.430
So you must be having a hard time here.

04:17.690 --> 04:18.829
Right?

04:20.310 --> 04:22.970
Every day, you have to eat and sleep...

04:22.970 --> 04:25.240
right next to strangers
who committed all sorts of crimes.

04:25.550 --> 04:27.170
It must be awful.

04:29.220 --> 04:30.870
It is awful.

04:31.640 --> 04:32.840
So...

04:33.810 --> 04:35.180
why don't you...

04:35.710 --> 04:37.010
tell us more about yourself?

04:37.310 --> 04:38.790
The people here...

04:38.790 --> 04:41.920
probably think that you're like them
and treat you as one of them.

04:44.390 --> 04:45.720
But in our eyes,

04:47.520 --> 04:49.530
you seem a little different.

04:51.700 --> 04:53.060
Well...

04:53.500 --> 04:56.330
They don't even wash themselves often.

04:57.410 --> 05:00.340
They stink,
and the cell is small and filthy.

05:00.750 --> 05:03.270
It's really driving me crazy.

05:04.070 --> 05:05.280
Right, I'm sure.

05:05.690 --> 05:07.140
So this was what we were wondering.

05:08.920 --> 05:10.380
Perhaps you...

05:12.790 --> 05:15.020
didn't actually intend to kill Soo Hyun...

05:15.020 --> 05:17.520
That's right, I...

05:17.520 --> 05:19.620
I never intended to kill her.

05:23.760 --> 05:25.460
That is why we want to hear your story.

05:26.460 --> 05:29.230
To find out exactly how different you are
from the others.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.780
You look like
you've lost quite a bit of weight.

05:41.620 --> 05:43.110
Have you been eating well?

05:47.950 --> 05:49.150
Then why don't we...

05:49.950 --> 05:52.820
eat something first
before we start talking?

06:25.300 --> 06:26.620
How are you feeling?

06:26.960 --> 06:29.390
I got to have a proper meal for a change.

06:30.440 --> 06:32.800
I wish every day was like today.

06:34.200 --> 06:35.300
Do you regret it?

06:39.350 --> 06:41.400
She was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

06:43.010 --> 06:45.840
Are you talking about Soo Hyun?
What exactly do you mean by that?

06:47.080 --> 06:49.250
Blame her bad luck.

06:53.730 --> 06:55.020
It's Soo Hyun.

06:55.930 --> 06:57.050
Her name.

06:59.620 --> 07:00.790
Lee Soo Hyun.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.660
Had she not come to that place that day,

07:07.000 --> 07:09.670
nothing would have happened to her or me.

07:12.110 --> 07:13.540
Do you think...

07:15.870 --> 07:17.680
it's Soo Hyun's fault
that you ended up like this?

07:17.680 --> 07:20.580
It is her fault for catching my attention.

07:46.370 --> 07:47.940
I wonder what was on his mind...

07:49.180 --> 07:52.080
as Cho Hyun Gil was watching
such an innocent child.

07:53.010 --> 07:54.680
Why does he feel differently
from the rest of us?

08:05.730 --> 08:07.360
Are you from Samcheonpo?

08:08.170 --> 08:09.790
I don't hear an accent though.

08:11.800 --> 08:14.060
I moved to Seoul when I was 15.

08:14.060 --> 08:15.500
In eighth grade?

08:15.500 --> 08:17.200
I didn't go to middle school.

08:18.240 --> 08:20.370
I started working as soon as I graduated
from elementary school.

08:20.370 --> 08:21.470
What kind of work?

08:21.480 --> 08:23.440
I worked at factories,

08:25.940 --> 08:29.410
sold fish, and worked at butcher shops.

08:30.080 --> 08:32.490
I did everything I was told to do.

08:32.490 --> 08:33.980
I had to work all sorts of jobs too.

08:37.730 --> 08:39.860
My family was very poor when I was young.

08:40.500 --> 08:41.760
Since I'm the eldest son,

08:42.299 --> 08:44.390
I had to help my parents on their farm...

08:44.390 --> 08:45.930
and sell our harvest.

08:46.460 --> 08:47.860
I did all sorts of things.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.800
Detective, what did you say your name was?

08:52.280 --> 08:53.400
My name?

08:54.910 --> 08:55.970
I'm Kook Young Soo.

08:55.970 --> 09:00.010
Detective Kook, then did you
also quit school after elementary school?

09:00.840 --> 09:05.110
I entered middle school
a year later than everyone else.

09:05.630 --> 09:09.420
I see. At least you went to middle school.

09:09.950 --> 09:13.430
Do you think you two are different?
What do you mean?

09:13.430 --> 09:16.430
You were both poor,
and both of you struggled.

09:16.440 --> 09:18.860
But he attended middle school,
so his situation was different.

09:22.180 --> 09:23.730
My life could've turned out
differently too.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.300
Do you think that's why you ended up
becoming a criminal?

09:27.570 --> 09:28.940
Because you had to quit school?

09:38.160 --> 09:39.280
Well...

09:40.950 --> 09:42.090

09:43.300 --> 09:45.720

Yes.

09:46.770 --> 09:49.040

11:55.080 --> 11:57.920
I'm sure there will come a day
when I'll crave a smoke.

15:07.290 --> 15:12.720
(April 2003)

15:12.720 --> 15:17.560
(July 2003)

15:17.560 --> 15:21.990
(August 2003)

15:27.810 --> 15:30.300
(Korean Beef Gopchang)

15:31.180 --> 15:32.940
How long has it been
since we had a team dinner?

15:33.740 --> 15:35.100
Eat up while you can.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.970
You may never see another day like this.

15:37.110 --> 15:38.570
You can eat. I'll grill these.

15:38.570 --> 15:40.240
It's all right. I'm an expert at grilling,

15:40.240 --> 15:41.790
so I never let anyone else do it.

15:41.790 --> 15:43.890
Well, I'll show you what I can do.
Give it here.

15:43.890 --> 15:45.110
No, sir.

15:45.420 --> 15:47.850
Please just eat this. It's hot.

15:48.760 --> 15:50.390
It's good.

15:50.630 --> 15:52.460
Please evaluate my skills.

15:53.130 --> 15:55.730
I'll eat it myself.
My gosh.

15:55.730 --> 15:57.290
You should eat too.
Okay.

15:57.640 --> 16:00.930
All right, then.
Let's continue to hang in there.

16:01.140 --> 16:02.260
Okay.

16:02.440 --> 16:04.630
Great work.
Bottoms up.

16:04.780 --> 16:06.180
Weather newsflash.

16:06.180 --> 16:07.780
The typhoon is heading north,

16:07.780 --> 16:10.670
making many parents worried
as they wait for their children.

16:10.840 --> 16:13.210
Typhoon 14, also known as Maemi,

16:13.210 --> 16:15.210
will cause strong winds to blow...

16:15.210 --> 16:17.580
as well as heavy rain
throughout the entire country.

16:18.060 --> 16:22.930
The wind speed of Maemi
can reach up to 60m per second.

16:22.930 --> 16:24.720
It first headed to Taiwan,

16:24.720 --> 16:26.900
then suddenly changed course...

16:26.900 --> 16:28.990
and began to head to the Korean peninsula.

16:32.190 --> 16:34.700
Honey, I'm home.

16:42.710 --> 16:43.810
Wait, honey...

16:48.020 --> 16:49.150
No.

16:51.160 --> 16:53.880
Honey!

16:54.130 --> 16:55.320
Honey!

16:55.950 --> 16:57.250
What's...

17:07.329 --> 17:10.069
There was another one.
No, why...

17:18.650 --> 17:20.040
(I wanted to take this woman,
so I shut her mouth and took her.)

17:20.040 --> 17:21.579
(She was already dead
before I could do anything. I got angry.)

17:40.030 --> 17:43.030
(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

17:47.040 --> 17:49.540
So do you know who the new chief is?

17:50.620 --> 17:51.740
Sorry?

17:52.270 --> 17:53.640
Oh, right.

17:53.710 --> 17:55.980
What's wrong? What's with that face?

17:57.210 --> 17:58.850
Oh, you're here.

17:59.250 --> 18:01.780
Hey, good morning, Tae Gu.

18:02.250 --> 18:03.520
Have you been well?

18:13.570 --> 18:15.430
Why didn't you tell me?

18:16.770 --> 18:18.800
You could've at least given me a heads up.

18:18.800 --> 18:20.650
Everyone already knew.

18:20.650 --> 18:22.150
I didn't need to do that.

18:22.150 --> 18:23.580
Everyone already knew.

18:23.580 --> 18:25.940
Everyone except me,
who has to take orders from him.

18:26.190 --> 18:28.610
I mean, I thought...

18:29.390 --> 18:32.050
you already knew too, Captain Yoon.

18:35.050 --> 18:36.190
I understand.

18:42.070 --> 18:44.090
Goodness, hello.

18:44.340 --> 18:46.140
I'm Kim Bong Sik,
the new chief of the Special Crime Squad.

18:46.140 --> 18:48.430
Hello.
Nice to meet you.

18:48.730 --> 18:50.410
I hope we all get along.

18:50.410 --> 18:52.270
Yes.
It's nice to meet you.

18:52.270 --> 18:53.880
Let's grab some soju sometime.

18:53.880 --> 18:55.000
Sure.
Okay.

18:57.120 --> 18:59.710
If you knew Kim Bong Sik was coming
as our new chief,

18:59.820 --> 19:01.810
you of all people could've let me know.

19:02.350 --> 19:06.920
I thought you'd only get stressed
if I told you ahead of time.

19:08.830 --> 19:10.660
Also, nothing would change anyway.

19:10.660 --> 19:12.490
Nothing could be changed,

19:13.570 --> 19:15.170
so I happened to be
the only one who didn't know?

19:15.170 --> 19:17.130
No, that's not what I meant.

19:17.440 --> 19:18.730
Well...

19:20.800 --> 19:21.930
I'm sorry.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.930
There's no need for you to apologize.

19:26.180 --> 19:27.270
Forget it.

19:28.440 --> 19:30.340
It probably wasn't easy for you either.

19:33.440 --> 19:36.010
Does the Analysis Team know?
The Analysis Team?

19:39.480 --> 19:41.090
Back when they were at Jungbu Station,

19:41.090 --> 19:42.360
I heard Song Ha Young...

19:42.360 --> 19:44.850
once betrayed Chief Kim Bong Sik.

19:46.190 --> 19:50.190
People in this field really love rumors,

19:51.460 --> 19:52.560
don't they?

19:56.000 --> 19:57.230
(Hwang Dae Sun,
rape and mutilation murderer)

19:57.230 --> 19:58.640
Why are you back?

19:58.640 --> 20:04.540
We still do not understand
why you committed these crimes, Mr. Hwang.

20:04.540 --> 20:05.740
(Keep quiet)

20:05.740 --> 20:07.190
So we came...

20:07.190 --> 20:09.550
to hear the story of your life, Mr. Hwang.

20:09.550 --> 20:10.750
What story?

20:10.820 --> 20:13.150
Well, can you share
the stories of your childhood?

20:13.980 --> 20:16.550
What will you do with the stories
of my unfortunate childhood?

20:17.900 --> 20:19.890
I guess you had lots of bad memories.

20:20.130 --> 20:21.390
In that case,

20:21.760 --> 20:24.460
can you tell me one thing
that made you the angriest?

20:28.960 --> 20:30.270
It's my dad.

20:35.270 --> 20:37.770
He always beat me up without a reason.

20:38.420 --> 20:39.780
He'd beat me up during meals,

20:39.780 --> 20:41.240
and beat me for going to school.

20:42.480 --> 20:44.160
There were days
when I actually skipped school...

20:44.160 --> 20:45.650
because he hurt me so badly.

20:46.980 --> 20:49.080
Whenever he beat me,
he stripped me down to my underwear,

20:49.600 --> 20:51.350
then kicked me out of the house.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.070
So I sat in front of the gate.

20:55.070 --> 20:58.530
So if your neighborhood friends saw you,

20:59.870 --> 21:01.900
they would've teased you a lot.

21:02.260 --> 21:05.700
Kids would make fun of me
until I went to middle school.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.240
I'd beat them up too.

21:12.040 --> 21:13.340
I never hung out with them.

21:13.420 --> 21:15.540
Those emotions
must have been tough on you.

21:17.620 --> 21:20.020
And it must've been embarrassing
that you weren't wearing clothes.

21:20.950 --> 21:23.820
How did you usually deal with your anger?

21:24.160 --> 21:25.820
There wasn't much I could do as a kid.

21:26.900 --> 21:29.260
All I could do was kill animals
because they couldn't talk.

21:31.990 --> 21:34.030
I killed my next-door neighbor's cow
with a sickle.

21:34.230 --> 21:35.860
I caught a dog in my neighborhood...

21:36.230 --> 21:39.570
and watched it jump and bark
in the hot, boiling water.

21:40.850 --> 21:43.070
Watching that got me off.

21:43.920 --> 21:46.580
My father stripped me
and kicked me out countless times.

21:48.010 --> 21:50.410
So I still hate it
when my body is exposed.

21:51.620 --> 21:52.750
It infuriates me.

21:54.190 --> 21:57.790
No matter how hot it is,
I never wear shorts or short sleeves.

21:57.790 --> 21:59.520
After you killed animals,

22:00.370 --> 22:02.490
did you dismember them too?

22:03.230 --> 22:04.330
Sometimes.

22:04.730 --> 22:06.130
I tried cutting them up.

22:06.460 --> 22:08.800
I learned cooking at a restaurant.

22:09.730 --> 22:12.230
Using a knife to cut them
into pieces was fun.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.840
Your second female victim.

22:16.710 --> 22:18.540
Is that why you cut off
the flesh on her leg...

22:18.940 --> 22:21.040
after you raped and murdered her?

22:22.280 --> 22:23.810
I don't know.

22:25.120 --> 22:27.380
I wanted to cut it off when she was alive.

22:28.830 --> 22:31.320
But she kept moving,
and her blood splattered.

22:32.050 --> 22:34.620
So I stopped for a bit.

22:35.400 --> 22:36.690
After I killed her,

22:38.190 --> 22:40.560
I sat next to her
and tried to cut it off again.

22:44.180 --> 22:47.370
But I don't remember much
because I was drunk.

22:47.440 --> 22:49.770
Then you took it home.

22:50.010 --> 22:51.680
But no one saw you?

22:51.680 --> 22:53.140
It was dripping in blood.

22:53.890 --> 22:55.380
I bet it must've scared people.

22:57.390 --> 22:59.010
Why? They wouldn't know what it was.

22:59.980 --> 23:01.720
I thought it was meat for a second...

23:02.480 --> 23:04.250
when I woke up the next day.

23:06.570 --> 23:10.230
Which one is it? You don't remember?
Or you don't want to talk to us?

23:12.030 --> 23:13.360
It's both.

23:17.410 --> 23:19.300
Must I tell you everything?

23:19.680 --> 23:21.300
You said it wasn't an interrogation.

23:25.820 --> 23:27.150
(Implement an improved reform system
for the future)

23:27.150 --> 23:29.210
Good day.
Good day.

23:30.360 --> 23:33.680
Hwang Dae Sun definitely shows
the behaviors of serial killers.

23:33.930 --> 23:36.620
Right. But why do you think
he cut off the flesh on her leg?

23:36.900 --> 23:38.590
It looks like he didn't know either.

23:39.360 --> 23:42.960
I think his rage
against his abusive father...

23:43.260 --> 23:45.960
developed into abnormal sexual behaviors.

23:46.260 --> 23:49.060
Then his rage caused him
to mutilate the body too.

23:49.840 --> 23:50.930
Right.

23:52.850 --> 23:54.040
Gosh.

23:54.610 --> 23:57.820
Many organizations are trying
to support flood victims...

23:57.820 --> 24:01.040
from Typhoon Maemi which struck
the Korean Peninsula pretty hard.

24:01.890 --> 24:03.880
The civic organizations...

24:04.480 --> 24:06.210
How may I help you?

24:09.490 --> 24:12.150
(No smoking)

24:12.250 --> 24:14.790
Is this the Behavioral Analysis Team?

24:15.930 --> 24:18.360
Yes.
Where's Song Ha Young?

24:18.640 --> 24:22.360
Inspector Song? He's out for an interview.

24:22.800 --> 24:24.030
"Inspector"?

24:24.030 --> 24:26.600
Should I tell him
you stopped by when he comes back?

24:28.150 --> 24:30.940
("Sky, Wind, Star, and Poetry"
by Yun Dong Ju)

24:31.350 --> 24:32.770
He hasn't changed.

24:37.210 --> 24:39.250
What brings you here?

24:39.660 --> 24:41.720
Don't mind me.

24:42.190 --> 24:43.390
Get back to work.

24:51.990 --> 24:55.160
It's like nothing ever happened.
This isn't fair.

24:56.530 --> 24:57.700
What?

24:58.640 --> 24:59.740
The weather.

25:01.300 --> 25:03.270
The weather can't be this good.
It's cheating.

25:05.740 --> 25:07.480
The pain and sense of loss.

25:07.980 --> 25:09.810
The suffering...

25:10.480 --> 25:13.380
is only up to the victims to bear.

25:14.860 --> 25:17.790
I bet some people are enjoying
this good weather.

25:30.270 --> 25:32.800
All right.

25:32.800 --> 25:36.000
He's not even investigating the case.
Why is he reading...

25:36.000 --> 25:38.610
the case reports for the detectives?

25:39.820 --> 25:42.180
Seriously. This nosy jerk.

25:42.710 --> 25:44.660
Hey. When he comes back,
I'll tell him you were...

25:44.660 --> 25:45.810
You!

25:47.720 --> 25:48.850
"Hey"?

25:49.830 --> 25:51.820
Read what it says on my name card.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.730
"Special Crime Squad Chief, Kim Bong Sik."

25:57.730 --> 25:59.290
Are you blind?

25:59.800 --> 26:00.840
I'm sorry.

26:00.840 --> 26:04.000
You seem to have picked up
bad habits from Song Ha Young.

26:04.270 --> 26:06.800
You're still wet behind your ears.

26:07.110 --> 26:09.810
No, I just mean this is the office
for the Behavioral Analysis Team.

26:09.820 --> 26:11.470
You need to tell me why you are here.

26:11.470 --> 26:14.150
You are going to make me repeat myself.

26:14.150 --> 26:16.410
You just mind your own business!

26:18.710 --> 26:20.180
I'm back.

26:22.590 --> 26:24.490
Have you been well,
Assistant Inspector Song?

26:25.050 --> 26:27.890
Right. I heard you're an inspector now.
Inspector Song.

26:28.830 --> 26:31.130
Goodness. You seem well.

26:31.140 --> 26:34.530
What do you guys do here?
Why are you dressed up?

26:35.730 --> 26:37.000
Why are you here?

26:37.000 --> 26:39.370
I don't expect you to give me
a warm welcome.

26:40.080 --> 26:43.320
But it's only polite to say hello
when you see your superior.

26:43.320 --> 26:44.340
Don't you agree?

26:44.350 --> 26:46.880
Seriously.
This team is full of rude punks.

26:46.940 --> 26:48.940
Hello. I'm Statistics Analyst Jung Woo Ju.

26:48.940 --> 26:50.410
Statistics analyst?

26:51.360 --> 26:53.050
You guys have difficult titles here.

26:53.050 --> 26:55.780
Dumb people won't be able
to remember them.

26:55.830 --> 26:56.920
What was it called?

26:57.430 --> 27:00.720
Right. A profiler.

27:02.670 --> 27:05.390
If you need to talk to me,
let's talk outside.

27:05.400 --> 27:08.560
I have nothing to say to you in private.

27:08.910 --> 27:11.080
I just wanted to say hello
since I was in the building.

27:11.080 --> 27:14.270
And I wanted to check out
what you do here.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.940
Why is the door open? Did...

27:17.540 --> 27:19.840
It's been a while, Captain Kook.

27:20.850 --> 27:23.110
I've been transferred
to the Special Crime Squad today.

27:23.660 --> 27:25.480
We'll be running into each other a lot.

27:25.620 --> 27:27.050
I look forward to working with you.

27:27.050 --> 27:30.020
Okay.
It was nice to see everyone.

27:30.600 --> 27:34.160
Right. I bought this for you.

27:34.290 --> 27:35.890
I almost forgot.

27:41.070 --> 27:45.030
You still eat chocolates
like a little kid, right?

27:47.440 --> 27:49.910
We'll be seeing each other every day
even if you don't want to.

27:50.540 --> 27:52.210
Let's put our past behind us.

27:55.010 --> 27:56.750
See you around.

27:58.980 --> 28:01.120
All right.

28:02.720 --> 28:04.550
Who was that?

28:04.690 --> 28:07.660
Just as I heard, he's one rude cop.

28:11.730 --> 28:14.160
I was wondering
how great his career was going...

28:14.960 --> 28:17.970
after he stabbed me,
his mentor, in the back.

28:18.840 --> 28:21.170
You've got to be kidding me. An inspector?

28:38.130 --> 28:41.070
(November 1996)

28:41.070 --> 28:43.090
Search every nook and cranny
of the neighborhood.

28:49.610 --> 28:52.970
He's wearing a black jacket
with a hoodie and black sneakers.

28:52.970 --> 28:54.070
Find him now!

29:17.400 --> 29:20.560
I'm chasing a man
who fits the description.

29:20.910 --> 29:23.110
I'm sorry. I lost him.

29:23.110 --> 29:25.130
Yoon Tae Gu, where are you?

29:25.640 --> 29:26.770
Where are you?

30:25.030 --> 30:26.260
Let go of me.

30:43.040 --> 30:44.150
Gosh.

30:49.750 --> 30:50.850
Darn it.

30:51.360 --> 30:52.490
Jung Soo Chan.

30:52.660 --> 30:54.460
You're under arrest...

30:54.460 --> 30:56.790
for robbery, murder, and fleeing.

30:57.940 --> 31:00.060
You have the right
to consult an attorney...

31:00.300 --> 31:02.330
and to remain silent.
Get him!

31:03.580 --> 31:04.700
Gosh.

31:05.500 --> 31:06.900
Did you catch him?

31:07.270 --> 31:09.340
Gosh. You really are a detective now.

31:09.680 --> 31:11.440
Hey. We got him.

31:11.710 --> 31:13.140
Don't stand there. Get him.

31:14.780 --> 31:16.610
Yoon Tae Gu caught Jung Soo Chan.

31:18.390 --> 31:19.780
Nice, Detective Yoon.

31:21.090 --> 31:22.350
She got him.

31:24.660 --> 31:25.790
This punk.

31:26.130 --> 31:29.400
You set an example
for your fellow officers...

31:29.400 --> 31:32.170
by promptly arresting
a robbery and murder suspect...

31:32.170 --> 31:34.700
who was on the run
after committing a brutal crime.

31:34.700 --> 31:36.000
Hence, I hereby award...

31:36.000 --> 31:38.570
Inspector Yoon Tae Gu.

31:41.880 --> 31:43.200
(Special Promotion Ceremony)

31:55.480 --> 31:57.890
Yoon Tae Gu!

31:58.130 --> 31:59.860
Come on. Let's shout together.
Tae Gu, you rock.

31:59.860 --> 32:01.890
Well done!
Go, Yoon Tae Gu!

32:02.290 --> 32:05.630
Oh, my. You really look like a cop now.

32:05.870 --> 32:08.140
Who knew you'd last this long?
I thought you'd quit to get married.

32:08.140 --> 32:09.140
Come on.
She's so cool.

32:09.140 --> 32:10.910
At this rate, you'll be promoted
to commissioner in no time.

32:10.910 --> 32:12.530
For sure.
Tae Gu can definitely do that.

32:12.530 --> 32:14.080
Could you take a photo of us?

32:14.080 --> 32:15.970
Sure!
Can we join?

32:20.090 --> 32:22.340
You even got a special promotion
thanks to Song Ha Young.

32:23.040 --> 32:25.210
I'm surprised you're holding out so well,
Yoon Tae Gu.

32:30.190 --> 32:32.190
Okay, let's try that one more time.

32:34.600 --> 32:37.630
Nice, that looks great. Make a V.

32:42.610 --> 32:43.800
Captain.

32:45.110 --> 32:47.000
Captain Yoon.
Yes.

32:47.540 --> 32:49.170
Superintendent Baek
wants to meet with you.

32:49.300 --> 32:51.210
Superintendent Baek? Why?

32:51.210 --> 32:52.240
I have no idea.

32:52.240 --> 32:54.010
He asked for Chief Kim Bong Sik too,

32:54.010 --> 32:55.510
but I don't know where he is now.

32:56.190 --> 32:57.280
Cheers.

32:58.010 --> 33:00.220
It's nice to have you back.

33:03.750 --> 33:06.690
You're the only one who's happy to see me,

33:07.220 --> 33:10.440
so I'm not sure whether or not
I've been doing well so far.

33:10.440 --> 33:14.100
Come on. I really meant it.
Must you twist my words like this?

33:14.200 --> 33:17.000
What you need is my intel, not me.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.840
That's what makes you indispensable.

33:18.840 --> 33:22.040
Anyway, pretend not to know me
when you see me at HQ.

33:22.040 --> 33:24.170
Goodness. Don't you worry.

33:25.120 --> 33:27.310
Life is full of ironies.

33:28.120 --> 33:29.740
Song Ha Young and even Yoon Tae Gu.

33:29.740 --> 33:31.750
Who knew I'd meet them again here?

33:32.510 --> 33:34.620
Is this fate or something?

33:34.690 --> 33:37.320
Did you meet Inspector Song Ha Young?

33:38.360 --> 33:39.360
Yes, I sure did.

33:39.360 --> 33:41.790
I can't figure out what his team does.

33:41.790 --> 33:44.730
When you stab someone in the back,
it all comes back to you...

33:46.260 --> 33:48.640
Darn it. There's one exception.

33:48.640 --> 33:50.770
Who? You?

33:51.180 --> 33:52.370
You little...

33:53.380 --> 33:56.440
Remember? The head prosecutor...

33:56.770 --> 33:58.510
who asked for Yoon Tae Gu back then.

33:58.620 --> 33:59.740
(Head Prosecutor Lee Dong Ju)

33:59.740 --> 34:00.880
Here.

34:01.920 --> 34:04.780
It's classified information,
so don't reveal your source.

34:04.780 --> 34:06.210
Investigate it alone, quietly.

34:06.950 --> 34:08.159
This is credible info, right?

34:08.159 --> 34:09.850
Have I ever lied to you?

34:10.250 --> 34:12.750
Go through it. There's solid evidence too.

34:15.790 --> 34:18.460
Why did I miss all this?

34:18.489 --> 34:21.400
Yoon Tae Gu is
one of your direct reports, right?

34:21.500 --> 34:22.630
Yes, sir.

34:23.840 --> 34:26.130
Hello.
Where is Room Ten?

34:26.130 --> 34:29.000
It's this way.
You'll find it on your left.

34:29.610 --> 34:30.610
Yoon Tae Gu.

34:30.610 --> 34:32.310
I mean, Detective Yoon.

34:32.920 --> 34:35.810
We're now getting the hang
of working together as a team,

34:35.880 --> 34:37.280
and you worked hard on this case,

34:37.280 --> 34:38.690
so I want to buy you a drink.

34:38.690 --> 34:39.980
Hurry up and meet me here, okay?

34:41.880 --> 34:43.449
I'm telling you.
My goodness.

34:44.090 --> 34:46.219
Oh, there she is. Come on in.

34:46.360 --> 34:48.070
You made it. Take a seat.

34:48.070 --> 34:49.860
Come on. Take a seat.

34:50.670 --> 34:51.860
Come on!

34:52.530 --> 34:53.860
Hey, where are you going?

34:54.610 --> 34:55.610
Are you a bar girl or what?

34:55.610 --> 34:57.700
Goodness, it's such a hot mess.

34:57.700 --> 34:59.700
How dare you disgrace
the entire police force?

34:59.700 --> 35:01.900
Detective Yoon, this is nuts.
How embarrassing.

35:03.510 --> 35:06.340
Remember? The head prosecutor...

35:06.340 --> 35:07.980
who asked for Yoon Tae Gu back then.

35:08.150 --> 35:09.610
I ended up taking bribes...

35:10.260 --> 35:12.210
from a building contractor
against my will...

35:13.150 --> 35:14.950
and arrested a fake suspect.

35:14.950 --> 35:16.820
Because of that,
I was branded a corrupt cop.

35:17.050 --> 35:19.350
Everything was set up
so he'd look like the real culprit.

35:19.550 --> 35:20.670
Anyone would have believed it.

35:20.670 --> 35:23.260
Song Ha Young didn't buy it!

35:23.400 --> 35:25.470
That punk really gets on my nerves.

35:25.470 --> 35:27.900
He has to get in the way
of everything I do.

35:28.110 --> 35:29.610
I got demoted because of that jerk.

35:29.610 --> 35:31.970
But you're back now.

35:32.340 --> 35:35.010
Song Ha Young was branded...

35:35.010 --> 35:36.550
a backstabbing troublemaker...

35:36.550 --> 35:37.870
who betrays his superiors.

35:38.150 --> 35:41.280
That's why he's working
in that dump of an office now.

35:41.280 --> 35:42.810
That's not enough.

35:43.880 --> 35:45.190
He acts like a gentleman to your face...

35:45.190 --> 35:48.080
but skims the cream off the top
behind your back.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.950
Everyone needs to know that.

35:49.950 --> 35:51.090
Bong Sik.

35:51.300 --> 35:54.920
I'll only trust Chief Kim Bong Sik,
who's back in Seoul now.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.470
Why would you trust me?
Don't trust anyone.

35:57.470 --> 35:59.890
Goodness, you're hurting my feelings here.

36:00.240 --> 36:01.360
You don't even trust me?

36:01.360 --> 36:03.460
You little...

36:05.970 --> 36:09.240
By the way,
the Suseong-dong case in Gangnam.

36:09.240 --> 36:11.370
Who is the victim?

36:11.610 --> 36:14.150
Those at Gangnam Police Station
are keeping it on the hush-hush.

36:14.150 --> 36:16.110
Hey, today is my first day.

36:16.380 --> 36:18.580
You must've heard something,
even just in passing.

36:18.650 --> 36:21.450
Can I please eat first?

36:25.130 --> 36:27.060
Captain Yoon, you're here.

36:27.570 --> 36:29.990
I heard you asked for me.
What? You came alone?

36:30.130 --> 36:31.590
Is Bong Sik not at his desk?

36:31.900 --> 36:34.010
Detectives must be ready
to mobilize at all times.

36:34.010 --> 36:36.340
Today is his first day,
and we can't even reach him?

36:36.340 --> 36:37.380
Darn it.

36:37.380 --> 36:40.270
We need you to take on this case.

36:40.950 --> 36:42.150
The victim is Han Seok Hoon,

36:42.150 --> 36:43.970
an economics professor
at Hankuk University.

36:44.470 --> 36:47.880
He and his wife were murdered
in their home two weeks ago.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.590
(Murder of Elderly Couple in Suseong-dong)

36:50.590 --> 36:52.050
We need you to investigate it.

36:53.190 --> 36:54.720
This case belongs
to Gangnam Police Station.

36:54.720 --> 36:57.150
It does fall under their jurisdiction,

36:57.860 --> 37:00.970
but he's related to someone
who is very high up.

37:00.970 --> 37:02.700
I was asked to look into it quietly,

37:02.700 --> 37:04.090
so that's all I know.

37:04.090 --> 37:05.840
But I think
they're struggling to find leads.

37:05.840 --> 37:07.830
How do I find a phone number?

37:08.840 --> 37:12.030
I think the reporters
already caught a whiff of it.

37:12.030 --> 37:13.840
The higher-ups want us...

37:13.840 --> 37:16.570
to prevent further media coverage
and investigate it swiftly.

37:16.700 --> 37:19.270
Everyone at Gangnam Police Station
will help you out.

37:19.780 --> 37:21.040
Okay.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.280
I'll be off, then.
Okay.

37:23.510 --> 37:24.950
There, I found it.

37:26.610 --> 37:27.630
Look at this.

37:27.630 --> 37:30.260
This punk, Kim Bong Sik.
He's not picking up.

37:30.260 --> 37:31.620
Is it an important case?

37:32.050 --> 37:33.860
All homicide cases are equally important.

37:34.090 --> 37:35.260
That's true.

37:35.720 --> 37:37.690
Why are we investigating
Gangnam Police Station's case?

37:37.760 --> 37:39.430
We should go there to find out more.

37:39.800 --> 37:42.400
Chief Kim still isn't at his desk?
No.

37:43.070 --> 37:44.780
People really don't change.

37:44.780 --> 37:46.240
(September 29, 2003)

37:46.240 --> 37:48.000
Are we leaving now? Just the two of us?

37:48.170 --> 37:50.010
(Gungok-dong, Jongno)

37:50.010 --> 37:52.010
(September 24, 2003)

38:46.940 --> 38:48.030
No, please...

39:00.860 --> 39:03.320
(Victim Han Seok Hoon,
economics professor)

39:03.420 --> 39:06.360
Darn it, this scumbag...

39:08.360 --> 39:11.330
(Murder of Elderly Couple in Suseong-dong)

39:11.730 --> 39:15.240
The victims of the murder of the couple
in their 60s in Suseong-dong.

39:15.240 --> 39:16.340
Han Seok Hoon,

39:16.340 --> 39:18.810
a Hankuk University professor,
and his wife.

39:23.510 --> 39:25.850
I bet there's something about
Professor Han Seok Hoon.

39:25.850 --> 39:27.250
Gosh, seriously.

39:28.080 --> 39:30.550
I told you not to say the victim's name.

39:30.850 --> 39:34.060
Come on. You need to give me
something to write about.

39:34.060 --> 39:35.520
Loyalty isn't a one-way street.

39:36.560 --> 39:39.660
They've been preserving the scene
for over two weeks now.

39:39.930 --> 39:42.960
There's definitely something.

39:43.830 --> 39:45.530
Will you really not tell me anything?

39:47.540 --> 39:48.640
Over here.

39:51.010 --> 39:52.340
Good day.

39:52.370 --> 39:53.870
I'm Yoon Tae Gu from the Seoul HQ.

39:53.870 --> 39:55.610
This is...
Nam Il Young, also from HQ.

39:55.610 --> 39:57.450
Yes, they called me. This way, please.

39:57.450 --> 39:58.980
Okay.
Hey, tidy up here.

40:11.030 --> 40:12.960
(Do Not Enter)

40:27.140 --> 40:30.380
There was cash lying around,
but he didn't even touch it.

40:31.980 --> 40:35.150
They think it's an act of resentment
masked as a burglary.

40:40.620 --> 40:41.960
It's clean.

40:45.390 --> 40:47.090
It means the victims were overpowered...

40:49.330 --> 40:51.630
without any sort of resistance.

40:51.630 --> 40:53.270
If they had resisted,
the blood would have splattered...

40:53.600 --> 40:57.170
to the ceiling
because his weapon was swinging around.

40:57.710 --> 40:59.870
You'll see that the victims' bodies
are clean...

40:59.870 --> 41:02.910
with no sign of defense
when you get to the morgue later.

41:03.840 --> 41:06.410
Gosh, I don't know
what this horrifying guy hit them with.

41:06.710 --> 41:09.680
We're trying our best to find out
but weren't able to identify it yet.

41:09.680 --> 41:11.390
He came into a rich house like this...

41:11.390 --> 41:14.320
and he didn't touch the cash
but only pretended to look for it.

41:14.660 --> 41:15.990
Do you think he had a grudge against them?

41:16.160 --> 41:18.830
We looked into that,
but that seems highly unlikely.

41:19.330 --> 41:21.730
Both husband and wife
had a great reputation.

41:22.700 --> 41:25.200
Their identities are accompanied
by their social position.

41:25.200 --> 41:28.000
So they may have incurred a grudge
from someone without knowing.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.040
You're saying it may be the doings
of an acquaintance holding a grudge?

41:32.210 --> 41:34.010
Shall we start by investigating
around the school?

41:34.010 --> 41:35.310
We already did.

41:36.780 --> 41:38.650
Even if we consider this
to be an act of resentment...

41:40.210 --> 41:42.620
his method is too bold and violent.

41:42.620 --> 41:46.250
Overkilling is common amongst
murder targeting acquaintances.

41:46.320 --> 41:48.090
I doubt that a mentally ill person...

41:48.090 --> 41:49.960
could have casually walked into
a house like this.

41:51.330 --> 41:53.990
Could you please give us the list of
acquaintances you interviewed?

41:53.990 --> 41:55.300
Yes, I will.

41:56.230 --> 41:58.500
Once you get the list,
check to see if there's anyone...

41:58.500 --> 42:00.430
with records of previous convictions
and mental illness.

42:00.630 --> 42:01.670
Yes, ma'am.

42:01.670 --> 42:04.610
Why did a detective from Seoul HQ
come to a case in Gangnam?

42:10.480 --> 42:11.580
Yes, sir?

42:11.950 --> 42:14.350
Hey! Didn't I tell you
to release first and fact check later?

42:14.450 --> 42:15.950
An article has been released...

42:15.950 --> 42:18.750
identifying the Suseong-dong victim
as Professor Han Seok Hoon!

42:18.990 --> 42:19.990
What?

42:19.990 --> 42:23.420
You try to be respectful,
conscientious, and even loyal.

42:23.420 --> 42:26.390
So when do you plan
on trying to get an exclusive?

42:26.390 --> 42:27.860
Who wrote that article?

42:28.130 --> 42:30.430
Who do you think?
It's Im Moo Sik, of course.

you'll have homework tonight.

Hwang Dae Sun, aren't you?

44:23.510 --> 44:24.780
You know me.

44:25.510 --> 44:26.680
Why don't we start our meeting?

44:27.250 --> 44:29.850
Serial murders can be categorized
into these three things.

44:29.850 --> 44:30.920
A psychological cooling-off period.

44:30.920 --> 44:33.520
Crime committed against a stranger,
for the sole purpose of murder.

44:33.520 --> 44:37.120
Murdering 3 or more people,
in 3 or more locations.

44:37.120 --> 44:38.860
Out of all the prisoners
we've met until now,

44:38.860 --> 44:41.800
Hwang Dae Sun is closest...

44:41.930 --> 44:44.630
to the serial murderer category
that we've been researching.

44:44.630 --> 44:46.530
He can be viewed as a serial killer
since he killed three people.

44:46.530 --> 44:48.300
But to be exact,
he ended up with three victims...

44:48.300 --> 44:49.670
from two different cases.

44:49.670 --> 44:51.040
He killed one out of impulse.

44:51.440 --> 44:53.010
He may have been planning on murdering...

44:53.010 --> 44:54.880
but it was one that
derailed from his plans.

44:54.880 --> 44:57.980
I see two were raped then murdered
and the other was a man.

44:57.980 --> 45:00.810
He had been drinking
when committing both cases.

45:01.320 --> 45:05.590
The man was the second victim's boyfriend.

45:05.590 --> 45:07.860
Then the boyfriend was the target
of his impulsive crime?

45:07.860 --> 45:09.020
Exactly.

45:09.020 --> 45:10.820
He was murdered...

45:10.820 --> 45:14.400
when he came over to see his girlfriend
and witnessed the rape.

45:14.400 --> 45:17.160
All three victims were murdered
while he was under the influence...

45:17.160 --> 45:19.030
it must have been categorized
as an unsystematic crime.

45:19.770 --> 45:21.370
Just because he murdered
when under the influence...

45:21.370 --> 45:23.400
doesn't mean that
it was an unsystematic crime.

45:23.400 --> 45:24.970
An unsystematic crime...

45:24.970 --> 45:27.610
is when the culprit becomes
confused while committing the crime.

45:27.740 --> 45:31.010
In the case of Hwang Dae Sun,
we can interpret his acts of...

45:31.010 --> 45:33.980
binding and carving out the skin,
as abnormal sexual behaviors.

45:34.080 --> 45:35.620
So it doesn't add up perfectly.

45:35.620 --> 45:38.650
If you look at it according to
the FBI's categories of crime...

45:38.650 --> 45:41.190
a systematic type is someone
who has problems with their personality.

45:41.190 --> 45:42.220
An unsystematic type...

45:42.220 --> 45:44.560
is categorized as someone
delusional or schizophrenic.

45:44.560 --> 45:47.060
With that in mind, Hwang Dae Sun...

45:48.230 --> 45:50.200
isn't someone who has a mental illness...

45:50.700 --> 45:53.230
but a systematic type
with a personality disorder.

45:54.300 --> 45:55.300
Gosh, this is really difficult.

45:55.300 --> 45:58.010
In the case of Hwang Dae Sun,
he showed systematic behavior...

45:58.010 --> 46:00.640
in how he searched for his victim,
planned, and bound them using tools.

46:00.640 --> 46:02.640
I understand when you tell me...

46:02.680 --> 46:05.010
I think the process of reasoning
is always very difficult.

46:05.010 --> 46:06.380
All right then.

46:06.380 --> 46:09.820
I think the reason for
Hwang Dae Sun's case is...

46:11.120 --> 46:13.920
this one. Killing more than three.

46:13.920 --> 46:15.020
Okay.

46:15.590 --> 46:18.260
But I think it's more accurate to label it
a rape and murder case...

46:18.260 --> 46:19.490
which has more continuity to it.

46:19.930 --> 46:21.960
Right, since he had
a sexual purpose to it.

46:22.130 --> 46:25.270
Right, but there was a bigger chance
of him becoming...

46:25.300 --> 46:27.200
a serial killer like in our study
if he hadn't been caught.

46:27.200 --> 46:30.640
I was shocked when I heard
he killed animals as a kid.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.710
It's a classic feature
that a serial killer has.

46:34.710 --> 46:36.310
He didn't have
a cooling-off period though.

46:36.310 --> 46:39.410
(A psychological cooling-off period)

46:39.710 --> 46:42.550
The culprit behind the Suseong-dong
murder case of the old couple...

46:42.550 --> 46:45.150
in their 60s which happened
in Gangnam on the 10th...

46:45.150 --> 46:46.920
has yet to be caught.

46:46.920 --> 46:51.090
People are shocked
after the victim was identified...

46:51.090 --> 46:52.830
as Hankuk University's
Professor Han Seok Hoon.

46:53.090 --> 46:55.730
Not only did Professor Han...

46:55.730 --> 46:57.900
teach economics at the university,

46:57.900 --> 47:01.240
but he also appeared on TV often
to give his economical insights.

47:01.240 --> 47:04.470
His bold attitude led to his popularity.

47:04.810 --> 47:07.670
But does there always have to be
a psychological cooling-off period?

47:07.670 --> 47:10.610
Serial killers feel
the highest form of pleasure...

47:10.610 --> 47:12.110
in the pure act of killing.

47:12.110 --> 47:13.150
Once that feeling ends,

47:13.150 --> 47:15.250
they look for another victim
who will satisfy their need.

47:15.620 --> 47:17.420
To put it simply, a cooling-off period...

47:17.780 --> 47:20.350
is a period where their sense of
fulfillment and satisfaction...

47:20.350 --> 47:22.090
from the murder continues to last.

47:22.090 --> 47:24.320
Once that psychological satisfaction
comes to an end...

47:24.320 --> 47:26.360
they'll move on to the next murder.

47:26.360 --> 47:27.660
Then what about Hwang Dae Sun?

47:27.660 --> 47:29.000
In the case of Hwang Dae Sun,

47:29.260 --> 47:31.700
we can't view those periods
as a cooling-off period...

47:31.700 --> 47:33.530
since he was under the influence
for all the cases.

47:34.740 --> 47:37.640
But the fact that they murder again
once the cooling-off period ends...

47:37.640 --> 47:39.540
is so horrifying.

47:39.540 --> 47:41.010
Thankfully, in the Republic of Korea,

47:41.440 --> 47:43.140
there still hasn't been
a serial murder case...

47:43.140 --> 47:45.850
with the purpose of murder
followed by a cooling-off period.

47:45.850 --> 47:48.050
It's all just speculation.

47:48.520 --> 47:51.920
You wanted to catch guys like this
during your ten years, right?

48:08.300 --> 48:10.700
You said you didn't find
any injuries on the back...

48:10.700 --> 48:11.740
from either of them, right?

48:11.740 --> 48:13.310
Right, I didn't find any.

it all turns into Im Moo Sik's article,

55:47.200 --> 55:50.010
while you're sitting around
depending on Detective Park.

55:50.010 --> 55:51.310
Moo Sik...

55:51.310 --> 55:53.230
even steals articles from juniors?

55:53.580 --> 55:55.340
Man, talk about lack of conscience.

55:55.340 --> 55:57.700
Yes, conscience.

55:57.710 --> 55:59.380
You'll starve to death
after keeping your conscience.

55:59.380 --> 56:03.140
I've been running around a lot
trying not to starve to death.

56:03.890 --> 56:07.010
Okay, sure. You work so hard.
You're very commendable, aren't you?

56:07.220 --> 56:09.560
My diligent boss is doing
a great job at making me slave away.

56:09.560 --> 56:10.720
Forget it.

56:11.160 --> 56:13.350
Go out and find an item
that'll become as good a story...

56:13.430 --> 56:15.090
as the one you had stolen.

56:15.730 --> 56:17.890
It wasn't ours anyway.
What do you mean it was stolen?

56:20.900 --> 56:22.260
It's Detective Park.

56:24.640 --> 56:26.580
Another case at Gangnam Police Station.

56:26.580 --> 56:27.800
Again?
Yes.

56:28.040 --> 56:31.200
Hey, Reporter Choi, keep it up. Run!

56:31.450 --> 56:34.080
Forget all about
your conscience and loyalty!

56:34.080 --> 56:36.410
Reporter Choi, get us just one good story!

56:36.790 --> 56:39.510
Keep up the good work, then.

56:46.100 --> 56:48.520
Man, I like how big this office is.

56:52.100 --> 56:55.240
Are you satisfied with the result
of your first duty on the job?

56:55.240 --> 56:57.910
Captain Kook already did all the work.

56:57.910 --> 56:59.600
If I just sit there
taking up someone's spot,

56:59.810 --> 57:02.580
think of how awkward I'd feel.

57:02.580 --> 57:07.170
So what will they do
with all that information?

57:07.720 --> 57:08.850
No idea.

57:08.850 --> 57:10.910
He said he'll use it
as his pillow or something.

57:11.390 --> 57:16.020
I'm sure Captain Kook
will make good use of everything.

57:24.770 --> 57:27.240
Make sure you check
and take everything as needed!

57:27.240 --> 57:28.460
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

57:28.570 --> 57:30.500
In Tak.
Hey, Young Soo.

57:31.110 --> 57:32.400
Is something going on?

57:32.640 --> 57:34.040
Gangnam Station needed backup,

57:34.040 --> 57:35.540
so we're all going to Jinjung-dong.

57:35.540 --> 57:36.700
What about you?

57:36.780 --> 57:38.580
I have to check some footprints.

57:38.580 --> 57:39.910
I see. Keep it up.

57:40.620 --> 57:41.710
Okay.
Wait.

57:42.150 --> 57:44.390
To the Behavioral Analysis Team?
I'm fine. Get back to work.

57:44.390 --> 57:45.550
I'll go with you.

57:45.550 --> 57:47.860
Hey, I'm still going strong.

57:47.860 --> 57:49.160
You look busy. Get back to work.

57:49.160 --> 57:50.520
Hey.
Bye.

57:50.530 --> 57:52.250
Are you sure?
Yes.

57:52.530 --> 57:54.920
If you get stuck,
feel free to bring it to us.

57:55.560 --> 57:58.220
Bye.
Be careful!

57:59.300 --> 58:00.430
Darn it.

58:02.310 --> 58:04.060
Over here.
Salute.

58:12.480 --> 58:13.670
Grab everything there.

58:15.120 --> 58:16.780
Yes, there.
News flash.

58:16.850 --> 58:18.850
Today afternoon
in Jinjung-dong, Gangnam-gu,

58:18.850 --> 58:20.720
a woman in her 50s was found dead...

58:20.720 --> 58:22.630
after being struck by a blunt weapon.

58:22.630 --> 58:25.430
The police were dispatched
for an investigation...

58:25.430 --> 58:27.360
after a report made by Lee, the maid,

58:27.360 --> 58:29.270
who saw the collapsed victim
in her home in Jinjung-dong.

58:29.270 --> 58:30.820
Can you share something with us?

58:32.100 --> 58:33.340
Gangnam Police Station said...

58:33.340 --> 58:35.840
the culprit
of today's Jinjung-dong incident...

58:35.840 --> 58:36.970
and the Suseong-dong incident is...

58:36.970 --> 58:40.680
Chief Heo, what on earth is going on?

58:40.680 --> 58:42.240
I told you to investigate this quietly.

58:42.240 --> 58:43.810
Why is the case blowing up?

58:43.810 --> 58:46.610
Captain Yoon and Detective Nam are
at the scene right now.

58:46.980 --> 58:48.480
Let's hear from them once they return.

58:48.480 --> 58:49.640
Good grief.

58:50.150 --> 58:51.220
Where's Kim Bong Sik?

58:51.220 --> 58:52.990
No idea. But he'll crawl back...

58:52.990 --> 58:55.290
if he thinks this will affect
his performance.

58:55.290 --> 58:56.690
That's his deal.

58:56.690 --> 58:59.190
Look at how big this case has become.

59:00.330 --> 59:04.230
We might end up taking over
both of these cases.

59:04.230 --> 59:05.630
Tell me about it.

59:05.630 --> 59:07.270
These reporters already began to say...

59:07.270 --> 59:09.130
that they're related or something.

59:09.840 --> 59:13.230
I have a bad feeling about this.
We can't let this happen.

59:14.310 --> 59:16.140
Okay. Who is it?

59:17.780 --> 59:18.900
Excuse me.

59:19.450 --> 59:20.650
Hey.

59:20.650 --> 59:21.750
Hello.
Hello.

59:21.750 --> 59:22.820
What brings you here?

59:22.820 --> 59:25.780
I found something weird.
I wanted your opinion on this.

59:25.860 --> 59:27.010
What is it?

59:31.560 --> 59:32.560
They are both hiking shoes.

59:32.560 --> 59:34.060
Yes.
What about them?

59:34.060 --> 59:36.670
This one is from Suseong-dong, Gangnam.

59:36.670 --> 59:38.860
And this one is from Gungok-dong, Jongno.

59:42.440 --> 59:43.530
They match, right?

59:46.640 --> 59:49.170
They are from different districts,
but it's the same culprit?

59:52.250 --> 59:54.970
(A posh residential house in Gungok-dong)

59:58.420 --> 01:00:01.310
My mom cooked breakfast for me,
and I ate it and went to work.

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:03.780
When I called, she didn't answer.

01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:06.490
So I came home and...

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.730
Can you think of anyone
who held grudges against her?

01:00:09.730 --> 01:00:11.890
Or did she have any money problems?

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.360
None.

01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:17.210
Did she ever sound upset on the phone?

01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:18.210
No.

01:00:18.210 --> 01:00:19.330
Hey.

01:00:22.650 --> 01:00:23.680
("A Woman in Her 50s Found Dead
in Jinjung-dong")

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:26.310
What? There was another case
in Jinjung-dong.

01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:27.720
What?
Look at this.

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:29.050
Yes. I'm reading it now.

01:00:29.050 --> 01:00:31.820
"A woman in her 50s from
a 2-story house in Jinjung-dong..."

01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:33.680
"was found dead from blunt force trauma."

01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:37.080
(Blunt force trauma in the head)

01:00:37.330 --> 01:00:38.820
So was the victim in Gungok-dong.

01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:40.030
Right?

01:00:40.030 --> 01:00:41.190
I'll check out the crime scene.

01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:44.420
I'm going to the Special Crime Squad.

01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:46.600
As published in the news article,

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.890
this case had many similarities
to Professor Han's case.

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:51.670
What? Then it wasn't a revenge killing?

01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:54.880
We'll have to investigate more,
but we don't have any suspects...

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:57.100
for Professor Han's killer.

01:00:59.050 --> 01:01:01.920
They both died from
a blunt force trauma in the head.

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:03.710
And it was staged as a robbery?

01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:05.610
Yes.

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:08.420
Gil Pyo. Chief.

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:10.090
Hey, we're busy. Come back later.

01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:11.890
Check this out now.
Come back later.

01:01:11.890 --> 01:01:14.400
Just look at this.
They are both hiking shoes.

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:15.560
What about them?

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:16.930
In Tak brought them to me.

01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:19.890
One of them is from Suseong-dong.
The other one is from Gungok-dong.

01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:22.490
Suseong-dong is in Gangnam.
And Gungok-dong is in Jongno.

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:25.000
Give me that.
It's the same guy.

01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:27.430
I read the reports. It's the same MO.

01:01:29.810 --> 01:01:31.640
Blunt force trauma?
Yes. Exactly.

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:32.750
Suseong-dong and Gungok-dong...

01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:33.940
They were both hit in the head.

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:36.140
The victim in Jinjung-dong
also died from blunt force trauma.

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:40.180
You knew?

01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:43.450
I just got back...

01:01:45.090 --> 01:01:46.990
from the crime scene in Jinjung-dong.

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:50.760
Who on earth is this guy?

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.360
The MO is the same.

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:25.860
What are you doing here?

01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:27.530
Let me in.

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:30.470
You're not an investigator.
Why are you here?

01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:31.770
I need to see the crime scene.

01:02:31.770 --> 01:02:32.870
Leave!

01:02:33.310 --> 01:02:35.770
Don't try to steal my case. Get lost!

01:02:35.810 --> 01:02:37.880
Please. I must check the crime scene.

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:41.570
Hey. Didn't you hear me?
I told you to get lost, you punk!

01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:42.710
Darn it.

01:02:43.790 --> 01:02:45.340
This is important.

01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:03.900
(Scientific Investigations Team)

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:10.170
The victim was hit by a blunt instrument.

(Blunt force trauma in the head)

01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:24.420
There are no footsteps in the bedroom.

01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:26.550
And the safe wasn't touched either.

(Crime scene stepping plates)

01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:59.650
There's no trace
of blood splattered on the ceiling.

01:04:00.130 --> 01:04:01.250
It means...

01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:06.060
the culprit subdued the victim
with one blow.

01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:15.900
Yes.
Are you there?

01:04:20.650 --> 01:04:21.940
What do we do?

01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:27.950
I thought we had ten years.

01:04:29.730 --> 01:04:31.250
But it happened sooner than I thought.

01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:35.520
Everything fits.

the recent murder cases...

in the wealthy neighborhood...

01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:58.210
could have been part of a serial murder.

the three murder cases...

in Gangnam and Jongno
as serial murder cases...

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:05.760
and do their best
to find the culprit quickly...

in these neighborhoods.

in Suseong-dong...

And between these two cases,
a similar murder case...

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:18.340
took place in Gungok-dong, Jongno-gu.

01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:20.500

01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:22.710

to different neighborhoods...
