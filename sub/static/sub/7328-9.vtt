WEBVTT

00:02.403 --> 00:04.738
( screaming )

00:07.341 --> 00:08.609
Keep screaming, honey.

00:08.642 --> 00:11.045
That way the monster will
never find you.

00:20.654 --> 00:22.656
Boo.
( gasps )

00:24.592 --> 00:26.527
( screaming )

00:26.560 --> 00:28.596
Shh! Don't want to wake
the neighbors now, do we?

00:28.629 --> 00:31.332
No rough stuff... yet.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.436
This is going to be good.

00:41.709 --> 00:42.643
Whoa.

00:42.676 --> 00:44.412
Hey, easy now.

00:48.249 --> 00:49.483
Easy.

00:50.484 --> 00:51.319
Easy.

00:51.352 --> 00:53.421
Please don't...!
( gunshot )

00:57.725 --> 00:59.460
( gagging cough )

01:03.464 --> 01:07.435
Captioning sponsored by
PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

01:07.468 --> 01:11.405
and CBS

01:51.212 --> 01:52.913
Break out the gear.

01:52.946 --> 01:56.417
I'll coordinate with the MPs.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.886
You drink that, DiNozzo,
you're dead.

01:58.919 --> 01:59.853
Just my luck.

01:59.887 --> 02:02.456
One more hour
and we'd have been off duty.

02:02.490 --> 02:03.757
You got big plans today, Tony?

02:03.791 --> 02:06.527
Well, it is Saturday, Kate.
What do you think?

02:06.560 --> 02:07.495
You have a date

02:07.528 --> 02:09.463
with a girl who can't spell
her last name?

02:09.497 --> 02:11.832
First name?

02:11.865 --> 02:13.367
No, I'm supposed to volunteer

02:13.401 --> 02:15.803
at the Eighth Street
soup kitchen today.

02:15.836 --> 02:18.272
Wait... You help
feed the homeless?

02:18.306 --> 02:19.773
Don't be so surprised.

02:19.807 --> 02:23.344
Sorry, I just never pictured you
as a volunteer type.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.346
Well, there's a lot about me
you don't know, Kate.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.381
You're right.
I'm actually impressed for once.

02:27.415 --> 02:28.382
Coffee, probie.

02:28.416 --> 02:29.650
Looks like you
could use it.

02:29.683 --> 02:32.186
Oh, thanks, Tony.

02:32.220 --> 02:34.222
Don't mention it.

02:34.255 --> 02:37.391
You know, I think he's finally
starting to warm up to me.

02:37.425 --> 02:40.494
He even invited me
to a party this afternoon.

02:40.528 --> 02:41.695
Really? Where?

02:41.729 --> 02:43.864
It's a soup kitchen
in DC.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.699
A bunch of Playboy
centerfolds

02:45.733 --> 02:47.301
hosting a fund-raiser there.

02:52.506 --> 02:55.276
( camera shutter clicking )

02:55.309 --> 02:56.877
SERGEANT:
Seems pretty
open and shut.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.379
Perp broke in,
tried to rape her.

02:58.412 --> 02:59.413
She shot him.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.215
Guy's in critical condition
at the base hospital.

03:01.249 --> 03:02.683
I have a Marine
standing guard.

03:02.716 --> 03:03.817
You I.D. him yet, Sergeant?

03:03.851 --> 03:07.388
No, and he's not exactly
in talking shape, either, sir.

03:07.421 --> 03:08.722
This much blood loss,

03:08.756 --> 03:10.558
the guy's lucky
to be alive.

03:11.492 --> 03:12.560
Where's Mrs. Rowans?

03:12.593 --> 03:14.262
With the neighbor
next door.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.529
We'll need her statement.

03:17.265 --> 03:18.732
This is Sergeant Hagerty.

03:18.766 --> 03:20.268
Bring Mrs. Rowans home.

03:20.301 --> 03:21.269
I'll meet you
out front.

03:21.302 --> 03:22.236
Where's the weapon?

03:22.270 --> 03:24.305
It's over here,
the other side
of the couch.

03:27.575 --> 03:28.809
You touch it?

03:28.842 --> 03:29.943
Hell no, sir.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.246
I did get
the serial number, though.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.281
It's registered

03:33.314 --> 03:34.282
with the
Provost Marshal

03:34.315 --> 03:36.284
under her
husband's name--

03:36.317 --> 03:38.419
Major David Rowans.

03:38.452 --> 03:39.487
He's deployed in Iraq.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.988
Been gone
for over five months.

03:42.423 --> 03:44.292
We checked the exterior
of the house, Gibbs.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.225
No sign of a forced entry.

03:45.259 --> 03:46.994
They tend to leave
their doors unlocked.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.996
"They," Sergeant?

03:49.029 --> 03:50.798
This is a military
base, ma'am.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.600
The women expect a certain level

03:52.633 --> 03:54.368
of security
in their own home.

03:54.402 --> 03:56.404
I suspect that will
change after today.

03:56.437 --> 03:59.006
GIBBS:
Kate, DiNozzo, I want you to
head over to the base hospital.

03:59.039 --> 04:01.709
I want this dirtbag's
personal effects and his prints.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.010
Yeah.

04:03.043 --> 04:04.678
Enjoying that coffee,
McGee?

04:04.712 --> 04:06.414
Uh, yeah.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.482
It's not too hot?

04:15.055 --> 04:16.890
It's your coffee.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.859
I'm sorry, boss.
I'll get you another one.

04:19.893 --> 04:21.429
Thanks.

04:21.462 --> 04:25.866
Yeah, maybe next time,
you should remember rule 23.

04:25.899 --> 04:27.568
Is the at one about not
marrying a woman

04:27.601 --> 04:28.736
who eats more than you do?

04:28.769 --> 04:30.338
Never mess with
a Marine's coffee

04:30.371 --> 04:31.439
if you want to live,

04:31.472 --> 04:32.840
Agent DiNozzo.
That's right.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.410
Dead man walking.

04:39.413 --> 04:41.482
( electronic chimes )

04:43.717 --> 04:45.453
( chiming )

05:00.501 --> 05:02.470
WOMAN:
Let me guess--
you take it black, Agent Gibbs?

05:02.503 --> 05:04.372
Marines always do.

05:04.405 --> 05:05.706
What about you,
Agent McGee?

05:05.739 --> 05:06.740
Cream and sugar?

05:09.510 --> 05:12.112
Uh, you know what,
I still have to take
some photos outside,

05:12.145 --> 05:13.481
so maybe later,
but thank you.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.520
Is he old enough to be
an NCIS agent?

05:19.553 --> 05:22.923
I ask myself that every day.

05:22.956 --> 05:23.924
Um...
Thanks.

05:23.957 --> 05:27.127
sorry this place
is such a mess.

05:27.160 --> 05:31.632
I wasn't expecting
any company.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.767
Am I in trouble,
Agent Gibbs?

05:33.801 --> 05:37.771
You did what you had
to do, Mrs. Rowans.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.507
Please call me Laura.

05:39.540 --> 05:43.377
I just have a few questions
I need to ask you, Laura.

05:43.411 --> 05:45.413
Is he going to die?

05:45.446 --> 05:46.680
Maybe.

05:46.714 --> 05:48.549
I just wanted him to go away.

05:48.582 --> 05:51.018
I didn't want
to kill him.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.886
Did you know him?

05:54.021 --> 05:55.989
I never saw him
before in my life.

05:56.023 --> 05:59.427
Any idea how he got in?

05:59.460 --> 06:03.431
I usually leave the back door
unlocked when I'm downstairs.

06:03.464 --> 06:08.469
My husband doesn't like me
to smoke inside the house.

06:08.502 --> 06:11.505
Is he the one who taught
you how to shoot?

06:11.539 --> 06:12.673
Yeah.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.745
He's a smart guy.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.813
How long have you two
been married?

06:21.715 --> 06:23.584
Civilian time...

06:23.617 --> 06:25.553
four years.

06:26.887 --> 06:31.659
Marine time
is more like two.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.494
He's been away a lot.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.730
Must get lonely.

06:38.666 --> 06:42.035
Um... we don't have kids,

06:42.069 --> 06:44.738
so I don't really
fit in

06:44.772 --> 06:47.441
with the wives on base.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.843
I manage, I guess.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.615
Do you have a place
to stay tonight?

06:54.648 --> 06:56.484
My mom lives in Maryland.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.586
Is it okay if I go there?

06:58.619 --> 07:00.488
Mm-hmm.

07:00.521 --> 07:03.056
Just make sure
we have her number.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.658
You, uh...

07:04.692 --> 07:09.129
you think of anything,
you want to talk...

07:09.162 --> 07:11.231
give me a call.

07:11.264 --> 07:15.769
Or you could e-mail me--
night or day.

07:18.706 --> 07:19.607
I hate hospitals.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.510
Maybe we'll get lucky
and he's already dead.

07:22.543 --> 07:23.677
Hi.

07:23.711 --> 07:25.145
I'm Special Agent Todd...

07:25.178 --> 07:26.480
Tony DiNozzo, NCIS.

07:26.514 --> 07:28.015
This is Special Agent Todd.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.484
I'd love to ask you
a few questions.

07:30.518 --> 07:32.019
Say... over lunch,

07:32.052 --> 07:33.521
Lieutenant...?

07:33.554 --> 07:34.622
Uh, Kim.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.123
And this is my engagement ring,

07:36.156 --> 07:37.124
Agent DiNozzo.

07:37.157 --> 07:38.592
I brought my lunch.

07:38.626 --> 07:39.560
How can I help you?

07:42.896 --> 07:44.632
What can you tell us about
the gunshot victim

07:44.665 --> 07:45.499
brought in last night?

07:45.533 --> 07:47.167
I already told the MPs
everything I know.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.268
We're not MPs.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.170
What kind of shape
is he in?

07:51.872 --> 07:53.674
Stable for the moment.

07:53.707 --> 07:54.742
Well, we'll need
to talk to him.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.076
You'll have to
come back tomorrow.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.545
He's in ICU.

07:57.578 --> 07:58.679
He might be dead tomorrow,

07:58.712 --> 08:00.280
and we need answers
now, Lieutenant.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.584
He's not conscious, and he won't
be until tomorrow, Agent Todd.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.854
What about his personal effects?

08:06.887 --> 08:09.122
Right here.

08:11.959 --> 08:14.728
We had to cut off
most of his clothing.

08:14.762 --> 08:16.597
We'll need to get
his prints before we go.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.265
That will also have to wait
until...

08:18.298 --> 08:19.700
Tomorrow. Right.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.101
Lieutenant, this man

08:21.134 --> 08:22.536
tried to rape someone, so...

08:22.570 --> 08:23.537
We'll come back.

08:23.571 --> 08:24.638
Agent Todd--

08:24.672 --> 08:27.140
make sure the MP
guarding him

08:27.174 --> 08:31.211
doesn't screw up the DD-932-A6
form the way he did last time.

08:31.244 --> 08:32.946
If he does,
it's your ass.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.047
We clear?

08:34.081 --> 08:36.717
Crystal.
Crystal what?

08:36.750 --> 08:38.552
Sir.

08:38.586 --> 08:40.554
Better.

08:40.588 --> 08:42.556
Now get moving.
I don't have all day.

08:42.590 --> 08:45.759
Your MP's outside room 107.

08:50.097 --> 08:52.633
So wait... what were you
saying before

08:52.666 --> 08:54.134
about not being married?

08:54.167 --> 08:55.569
Or you're
almost married...

08:55.603 --> 08:57.805
thinking about it...
on a fence.

09:00.007 --> 09:02.710
Every road with access into
Quantico is blocked

09:02.743 --> 09:03.711
by armed gate guards.

09:03.744 --> 09:04.712
There's Marines everywhere.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.614
So why would a rapist
choose a victim here?

09:06.647 --> 09:08.982
HAGERTY:
Maybe he's got
a death wish, Agent McGee.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.653
McGEE:
There's easier ways to die.
It doesn't make sense.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.655
You about done
here, sir?

09:14.688 --> 09:16.690
Yeah, about, Sergeant.

09:16.724 --> 09:17.925
Just one thing--

09:17.958 --> 09:20.260
How'd our dirtbag
get on base?

09:20.293 --> 09:23.030
I've been asking myself
that same question, Agent Gibbs.

09:23.063 --> 09:26.166
I want you and your Marines
to check every car

09:26.199 --> 09:28.335
within a five mile radius
of Laura Rowan's house.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.638
For what specifically?

09:30.671 --> 09:33.240
Make sure their military
decals are current.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.175
They match up with
the plates on the car.
You got it.

09:36.276 --> 09:37.277
BOY:
Sorry.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.012
BOY 2:
Watch where
you're throwing.

09:39.046 --> 09:41.815
You threw it,
you go get it.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.851
Any cars
don't check out,

09:43.884 --> 09:45.352
you call me, okay?

09:45.385 --> 09:46.720
Hey, man,

09:46.754 --> 09:47.921
throw it.

09:56.196 --> 09:57.397
Whoa!

09:57.430 --> 09:58.799
Yeah!

10:02.169 --> 10:04.171
BOY 2:
Who is that guy?

10:05.806 --> 10:08.776
( monitor beeping )

10:16.116 --> 10:20.087
( indistinct conversation
in distance )

10:21.789 --> 10:23.023
( camera shutter clicking )

10:30.297 --> 10:32.866
It was... was a game.

10:32.900 --> 10:36.670
Laura invited me over...

10:38.071 --> 10:40.841
I thought she loved me...

10:52.920 --> 10:54.421
According to our rapist,

10:54.454 --> 10:56.957
he was invited over
by Laura Rowans.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.859
Oh, what was that little tip

10:58.892 --> 11:01.094
that I picked up
as a cop in Baltimore?

11:01.128 --> 11:03.931
Right on the...
Oh, yeah!

11:03.964 --> 11:05.899
Rapists are liars, Kate.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.735
I don't think we should
rule out anything, Tony.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.737
Oh, really?
Do you now, probie?

11:09.770 --> 11:12.172
All we have is Mrs. Rowans' word
for what happened last night.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.007
So you want to drag her in here

11:14.041 --> 11:15.208
and accuse her
of attempted murder, McGee?

11:15.242 --> 11:16.810
No, I didn't say that.
No. Let's do it.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.178
Not like she hasn't been
through enough crap already.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.080
You would know, you're
the master at giving it.

11:20.113 --> 11:20.814
Watch your lip, probie.

11:20.848 --> 11:21.982
Hey!
Your little
quivering lip!

11:22.015 --> 11:23.116
Hey!

11:23.150 --> 11:24.451
My God.

11:24.484 --> 11:26.053
I swear, the two
of you are worse

11:26.086 --> 11:28.221
than my brothers and they're
practically psychotic.

11:28.255 --> 11:29.957
We have to I.D. this guy.

11:29.990 --> 11:32.159
If we find a connection
between the two of them,

11:32.192 --> 11:34.394
we bring Laura Rowans
in for questioning.

11:34.427 --> 11:35.729
Agreed?

11:35.763 --> 11:36.997
His name's Jeremy Davison.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.367
Sergeant Hagerty
found his car

11:40.400 --> 11:42.302
parked outside
the Quantico rear gate.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.037
Keys, wallet,
I.D. all inside.

11:44.071 --> 11:46.073
Run his phone
records,

11:46.106 --> 11:48.108
see if he ever communicated
with Mrs. Rowans.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.142
I am on it.

11:49.176 --> 11:51.044
McGee.
Yeah, boss?

11:51.078 --> 11:52.445
Get a search warrant
for that address.

11:52.479 --> 11:53.446
On it.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.447
Hey, Kate.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.850
Your brothers really like that?

11:56.884 --> 11:59.152
Sadly, yes.

11:59.186 --> 12:02.155
Ah. Explains a lot.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.293
ABBY:
Jeremy Davison has
no criminal record, Gibbs.

12:06.326 --> 12:09.062
He's a civilian,
no ties to the military,

12:09.096 --> 12:11.799
his prints don't match
any open case files.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.500
The boy doesn't even have
a speeding ticket.

12:13.533 --> 12:16.169
We're talking cleaner than
clean, whiter than white.

12:16.203 --> 12:17.838
You put him in a line-up
with snow,

12:17.871 --> 12:19.139
snow is going to jail.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.174
Or it just means
he's never been caught.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.010
Or it just means
he was never caught.

12:23.043 --> 12:25.112
I want you to run
the DNA from his blood.

12:25.145 --> 12:26.046
Cross reference it with every

12:26.079 --> 12:27.147
database you
can think of.

12:27.180 --> 12:30.117
Considering there's no
centralized DNA depository,

12:30.150 --> 12:31.919
that could take months
and months and months...

12:31.952 --> 12:33.186
Uh-huh. Then you
better get started.

12:33.220 --> 12:35.022
You think he did it?

12:35.055 --> 12:38.125
Kind of depends on your
definition of "it."

12:38.158 --> 12:40.293
Spoken like
a true politician, Gibbs.

12:51.304 --> 12:53.306
TONY:
Still going through
his phone records, boss.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.242
Nothing so far
to or from Quantico.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.110
Home and office?
And cell.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.812
Got the warrant
to his apartment.

12:58.846 --> 12:59.546
It's in Alexandria.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.281
Keys.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.216
I'll get the sedan.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.918
No, you stay
on the phone records.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.053
McGee, I want
everything there is

13:06.086 --> 13:08.255
on Davison
by the time I get back.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.389
Kate.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.124
Come on, you're with me.

13:11.158 --> 13:13.160
Let's go.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.405
Clear.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.409
Clear.

13:31.945 --> 13:34.147
This is sort of how
I always pictured

13:34.181 --> 13:35.615
Tony's place.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.218
Yeah, except DiNozzo
has better furniture.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.988
All right, let's find out
who this guy really is.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.395
( beeps )

13:48.428 --> 13:49.897
You might want
to come

13:49.930 --> 13:52.232
take a look at this, Gibbs.

13:55.969 --> 13:58.405
She had to have
sent him that.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.007
Yeah? How do you figure that?

14:00.040 --> 14:02.509
Let's just say theoretically,

14:02.542 --> 14:04.344
I had a picture like this.

14:06.246 --> 14:10.250
I wouldn't be handing them out
on a street corner.

14:10.283 --> 14:14.221
Yeah, well, okay,
since we're being theoretical,

14:14.254 --> 14:17.357
what about if the guy happens
to work in a photo shop?

14:21.261 --> 14:25.365
Here's an e-mail
from Laura Rowans to Davison.

14:25.398 --> 14:28.668
"The thought of us possibly
meeting, Niceguy,

14:28.701 --> 14:31.238
"is both exhilarating
and terrifying.

14:31.271 --> 14:35.175
"On one hand, I can imagine you
throwing me down and..."

14:38.111 --> 14:39.079
Whoa.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.047
Whoa, what?

14:40.080 --> 14:44.918
Whoa, it's, uh,
it's pretty specific, Gibbs.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.319
Yeah?

14:46.353 --> 14:51.124
Uh, by specific,
I mean, uh, explicit.

14:52.525 --> 14:55.262
In the truest, most

14:55.295 --> 14:57.630
pornographic sense
of the word.

15:07.707 --> 15:11.411
Yeah, I'd say that's,
uh, specific, Kate.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.146
Bag it.

15:13.180 --> 15:15.315
( door unlocking )

15:19.619 --> 15:20.587
Jeremy?

15:20.620 --> 15:21.955
He's not here.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.424
Who the hell are you?!

15:24.457 --> 15:27.995
Special Agent Gibbs and Todd,

15:28.028 --> 15:30.030
NCIS.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.198
NCI-what?

15:31.231 --> 15:32.465
We're
Federal agents

15:32.499 --> 15:34.201
executing a search warrant.

15:34.234 --> 15:35.202
Who are you?

15:35.235 --> 15:36.436
Michelle.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.305
Michelle Davison.
Jeremy's sister.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.373
Is he okay?

15:40.407 --> 15:41.741
Your brother was shot
last night

15:41.774 --> 15:43.543
breaking into a home
on a Marine base.

15:43.576 --> 15:45.212
He's in critical
condition.

15:45.245 --> 15:47.047
Oh, my God.

15:47.080 --> 15:50.750
I knew it, I knew something
like this was going to happen.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.285
Something like what?

15:53.486 --> 15:55.222
He went on
a date last night

15:55.255 --> 15:57.290
with some girl he met
on the Internet.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.730
Ooh, is it my birthday?

16:03.763 --> 16:05.432
Yeah, you see
a bow on top?

16:05.465 --> 16:07.434
We think
Laura Rowans

16:07.467 --> 16:09.536
was having an online affair
with Jeremy Davison.

16:09.569 --> 16:10.770
Really?

16:10.803 --> 16:12.405
I could have
told her,

16:12.439 --> 16:14.707
Internet romances
never work out.

16:14.741 --> 16:17.110
They all end in
attempted murder, Abby?

16:17.144 --> 16:20.013
Only the really hot ones, Tony.

16:20.047 --> 16:23.116
I want proof it's true before
I drag Mrs. Rowans in here.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.085
ABBY:
Is this Davison's computer?

16:25.118 --> 16:26.086
GIBBS:
Yep.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.020
ABBY:
If I'm gonna find

16:27.054 --> 16:28.288
something conclusive, Gibbs,

16:28.321 --> 16:29.422
I'm gonna have to have
the lady's as well.

16:29.456 --> 16:30.323
McGee's on
the way with it.

16:30.357 --> 16:31.324
Then we're
in business.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.160
When do you need it by?
Now.

16:33.193 --> 16:36.296
Wow! Laura Rowans
wrote these?

16:36.329 --> 16:38.165
Allegedly.

16:38.198 --> 16:41.034
Okay, Abby, I'll of course need

16:41.068 --> 16:42.302
copies of all
of them, all right?

16:43.536 --> 16:45.438
What?

16:46.539 --> 16:48.208
Hey, McGee.

16:48.241 --> 16:52.379
Ready to plunge into the seedy
side of the Internet with me?

16:52.412 --> 16:54.814
I thought we agreed never
to discuss that at work.

16:54.847 --> 16:58.185
McGee, I'm talking
about the case.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.187
Right, the case.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.654
Okay, we'll leave
the two of you alone.

17:01.688 --> 17:02.822
But Gibbs won't,

17:02.855 --> 17:04.224
so I'd get busy.

17:04.257 --> 17:05.425
DiNozzo!

17:05.458 --> 17:07.060
I'm investigating here--
these letters

17:07.094 --> 17:08.328
speak to the suspect's
state of mind.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.362
I've read them,
and they're

17:09.396 --> 17:10.663
all pretty
much the same.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.165
I've only read two, and if

17:12.199 --> 17:13.433
you think they're all the same,

17:13.466 --> 17:15.302
then we definitely
need to talk, Kate.

17:15.335 --> 17:17.204
12 years of Catholic school says

17:17.237 --> 17:19.206
that ain't ever gonna happen.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.074
Do you still have
the pleated skirt?

17:21.874 --> 17:22.842
Get that.

17:22.875 --> 17:23.410
Yeah.

17:23.443 --> 17:25.478
So, uh, what's going on?

17:25.512 --> 17:27.447
Gibbs just said to bring
Laura Rowans' computer;

17:27.480 --> 17:28.448
he didn't say why.

17:28.481 --> 17:29.649
We've got a cybersex

17:29.682 --> 17:33.086
attempted murder kill-thing
going on, McGee.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.621
Really?
Cool, huh?

17:34.654 --> 17:36.223
Yeah.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.359
Come on...

17:44.164 --> 17:48.168
Let's say Laura did invite
Davison back to her house?

17:48.201 --> 17:49.236
Thank you.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.338
What would she gain
from shooting him?

17:51.371 --> 17:52.772
Maybe he was
blackmailing her?

17:52.805 --> 17:55.208
DiNozzo, he was lying
on the floor

17:55.242 --> 17:56.476
with two bullets in him.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.211
She could have
finished him off.

17:58.245 --> 17:59.512
Instead,
she dialed 911.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.481
She get cold feet?

18:01.514 --> 18:03.650
Or Davison decided
to surprise her,

18:03.683 --> 18:05.118
take it to next step

18:05.152 --> 18:06.486
from fantasy to reality.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.321
Well, if they only
communicated online,

18:08.355 --> 18:09.322
there's a possibility

18:09.356 --> 18:11.358
that she didn't even know
what he looked like.

18:11.391 --> 18:12.559
So you're saying
the whole thing

18:12.592 --> 18:13.593
might have been
an accident?

18:13.626 --> 18:15.462
I don't believe in accidents.

18:15.495 --> 18:16.629
KATE:
Or Davison

18:16.663 --> 18:18.798
could be your
garden-variety psycho.

18:18.831 --> 18:21.634
He latched on to Laura
and he didn't want to let go.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.270
We're missing
something here.

18:23.303 --> 18:24.571
And I think we found it, boss.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.173
ABBY:
Laura Rowans

18:26.206 --> 18:28.708
and Jeremy Davison
were definitely in contact.

18:28.741 --> 18:30.410
We can trace their
e-mail exchanges

18:30.443 --> 18:32.179
back to the day they met online.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.480
ABBY:
Four months ago,

18:33.513 --> 18:35.915
on a little Web site called
the Scarlet Secret.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.717
This is their home page.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.852
Oh, I got to get one of these.

18:39.886 --> 18:40.787
DiNozzo.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.223
I'm talking about
the plasma screen, Kate.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.524
What is this?

18:44.557 --> 18:45.925
Well, um,
you know Friendster,

18:45.958 --> 18:48.461
where people make web pages
with personal profiles

18:48.495 --> 18:49.662
to connect with
their friends online?

18:49.696 --> 18:51.298
And their friends
lead to their friends

18:51.331 --> 18:52.765
and so on and so on.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.502
ABBY:
Um...

18:55.535 --> 18:58.505
Okay... you know what
friends are, right?

18:58.538 --> 18:59.639
Abby.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.174
Well, it's kind of like that,

19:01.208 --> 19:02.041
only it's explicitly for sex.

19:02.074 --> 19:05.478
Male, female,
preferences, fetishes.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.247
And you follow
the chain of pages,

19:07.280 --> 19:10.250
it should lead to somewhat
anonymous cybersex

19:10.283 --> 19:12.319
or a real face-to-face
meeting, if you want.

19:12.352 --> 19:13.253
You're a member?

19:13.286 --> 19:14.221
No.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.556
No, she just created
the page to look online.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.491
ABBY:
I did a little
trial and error,

19:18.525 --> 19:19.792
with Laura Rowans'
screen name--

19:19.826 --> 19:22.229
HomeAlone325,
and Jeremy Davison's

19:22.262 --> 19:23.896
Niceguy653.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.533
Care to guess which fetish
they have in common, Kate?

19:26.566 --> 19:30.637
No, no, I'm going to hell
just listening to all of this.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.507
Rape fantasies.

19:42.249 --> 19:45.918
What kind of a woman
is into rape fantasies?

19:45.952 --> 19:47.754
Actually, it's not
that uncommon, Kate.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.722
Actually, it's sick
and disturbing, McGee.

19:49.756 --> 19:50.890
I dated
a girl once

19:50.923 --> 19:52.592
who used to wear
my police uniform

19:52.625 --> 19:54.361
and make me call her
Detective Sipowicz.

19:54.394 --> 19:56.363
What the hell's
wrong with you?

19:56.396 --> 19:57.230
It wasn't my idea.

19:57.264 --> 19:59.766
Well, the police
uniform part was, but...

19:59.799 --> 20:01.901
How long's Gibbs going
to make her sit there?

20:01.934 --> 20:03.503
It's called
brewing, probie.

20:03.536 --> 20:07.240
She's scared, nervous,
imagining the worst.

20:07.274 --> 20:09.676
You gotta give it time
to percolate.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.980
What's going on, Agent Gibbs?

20:14.013 --> 20:16.015
I thought you said
I wasn't in any trouble.

20:16.048 --> 20:19.719
What makes you think
you're in trouble?

20:19.752 --> 20:22.555
I'm in an interrogation room.

20:22.589 --> 20:26.626
Did the man die?

20:26.659 --> 20:29.396
You mean Jeremy Davison?

20:29.429 --> 20:31.331
Is that his name?

20:31.364 --> 20:33.533
One of them.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.802
He's still alive.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.904
Though, you might

20:37.937 --> 20:42.409
know him better
as Niceguy653.

20:42.442 --> 20:45.645
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.614
No?

20:53.853 --> 20:55.888
Where did you get that?

20:55.922 --> 20:59.392
Off of Jeremy Davison's
computer.

20:59.426 --> 21:02.695
I don't understand? How?

21:02.729 --> 21:04.030
You sent it to him.

21:04.063 --> 21:09.669
No, I sent this
to my husband in Iraq.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.037
I told you,

21:11.070 --> 21:13.473
I never saw that man
before in my life.

21:13.506 --> 21:15.074
How could
I send this to him?

21:15.107 --> 21:17.544
You spend a lot of time
on the Internet,

21:17.577 --> 21:18.778
Mrs. Rowans.

21:18.811 --> 21:20.980
Why? What does that have
to do with anything?

21:21.013 --> 21:24.684
GIBBS:
It was an observation,
not a question.

21:30.423 --> 21:31.691
Oh, my God.

21:31.724 --> 21:34.761
You think I wrote this.

21:36.463 --> 21:38.531
Tell me about
the Scarlet Secret Web site.

21:40.767 --> 21:43.370
Uh... I...

21:43.403 --> 21:45.037
Where discriminating adults
go to play.

21:45.071 --> 21:46.038
Ring any bells?

21:48.975 --> 21:50.443
It's not like that.

21:50.477 --> 21:51.310
You and Jeremy

21:51.344 --> 21:52.912
decided to have
a little cyber fling.

21:52.945 --> 21:55.648
One of you decided
to take it to the next level.

21:55.682 --> 21:57.350
I want to know which one.

21:57.384 --> 22:02.722
I've never cheated
on my husband; I wouldn't.

22:02.755 --> 22:04.757
It was just
supposed to be a game.

22:04.791 --> 22:07.660
Does this feel
like a game, Mrs. Rowans?

22:07.694 --> 22:12.599
Um...

22:12.632 --> 22:19.105
I, uh, I fooled around
a couple times online,

22:19.138 --> 22:20.807
but I never
gave anyone my name

22:20.840 --> 22:22.709
or my picture.

22:22.742 --> 22:25.612
It was harmless!
It was just a fantasy!

22:25.645 --> 22:27.947
GIBBS:
This is sounding like
attempted murder.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.651
I have to talk to Gibbs.

22:31.684 --> 22:32.785
Uh, you're going
to have to wait,

22:32.819 --> 22:34.521
because the last time
I disturbed him

22:34.554 --> 22:36.022
in interrogation was
the last time...

22:36.055 --> 22:37.690
No, McGee, this is an emergency.

22:37.724 --> 22:38.925
We screwed up big time.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.627
GIBBS:
Then how do you explain this?

22:40.660 --> 22:42.495
This is a copy
of the e-mail

22:42.529 --> 22:45.164
you sent Jeremy inviting him
to your house Friday night.

22:45.197 --> 22:48.435
I did not write that.

22:48.468 --> 22:50.503
I never talked to anyone named

22:50.537 --> 22:51.704
"Mr. Nice Guy."

22:51.738 --> 22:54.541
Agent Gibbs, I swear to you.

22:54.574 --> 22:55.742
We have your computer.

22:55.775 --> 22:58.678
You two were exchanging e-mails
for months.

23:00.680 --> 23:04.016
KATE:
Uh, Agent Gibbs,
we need a word with you.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.863
What?

23:16.896 --> 23:18.898
Abby has something to tell you.

23:18.931 --> 23:21.734
I was digging deeper into
Laura Rowan's clusters--

23:21.768 --> 23:23.936
mostly the slack space--
and the log file alignment,

23:23.970 --> 23:26.673
it was off.
Not much, but enough.

23:26.706 --> 23:28.808
So I imaged the
sectors and I found

23:28.841 --> 23:30.743
trace elements
of corrupt...
English!

23:30.777 --> 23:32.745
She's telling
the truth, Gibbs.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.647
She didn't write those e-mails.

23:37.216 --> 23:38.818
Who did?

23:38.851 --> 23:40.487
I don't know.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.054
Sorry.

23:50.630 --> 23:51.531
So she was set up?

23:51.564 --> 23:54.200
It's more like
Jeremy Davison was set up.

23:54.233 --> 23:56.536
His computer wasn't
tampered with.

23:56.569 --> 23:57.904
He thought he
was communicating

23:57.937 --> 23:58.971
with Mrs. Rowans
the entire time.

23:59.005 --> 24:00.707
And the reason for luring him
onto a Marine base

24:00.740 --> 24:02.509
to rape a Marine wife?

24:02.542 --> 24:03.610
Well, closest thing
to a death sentence

24:03.643 --> 24:04.911
I can think of.

24:04.944 --> 24:09.015
Abby's lab, now.

24:09.048 --> 24:10.116
No dice, Gibbs.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.251
The hacker left no back trace

24:12.284 --> 24:13.319
on Laura Rowans'
machine.

24:13.352 --> 24:16.255
But we can tell when he created
the e-mail trail.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.690
The files overwritten
on her computer

24:17.724 --> 24:19.225
show that it happened
right around the time

24:19.258 --> 24:21.027
she shot Jeremy Davison.

24:21.060 --> 24:22.228
Like I said, this guy's good.

24:22.261 --> 24:24.531
The guy's a dirtbag, Abby.
I want him.

24:24.564 --> 24:25.632
McGEE:
Well, unfortunately,

24:25.665 --> 24:27.033
we can't find him from here.

24:27.066 --> 24:29.268
We need access to
the Scarlet Secret Web servers.

24:29.301 --> 24:31.070
And a warrant will take months.

24:31.103 --> 24:33.272
They have a rep for legally
fighting any attempt

24:33.305 --> 24:35.608
to breech the privacy
of their members.

24:35.642 --> 24:36.543
Can't we hack 'em?

24:36.576 --> 24:37.877
Won't work, Tony.

24:37.910 --> 24:38.878
We need core-level access

24:38.911 --> 24:41.280
with full admin privileges
to track this guy.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.549
Which means we have to be
on the inside to do it.

24:42.582 --> 24:43.415
Find another way.

24:43.449 --> 24:44.851
Abby, can you pull up
the home page

24:44.884 --> 24:45.852
for the Scarlet Secret?

24:45.885 --> 24:47.153
Really?

24:47.186 --> 24:49.255
I thought I saw something
that we could use.

24:49.288 --> 24:50.557
Mm.

24:53.125 --> 24:54.927
Okay, at the bottom here--
can you click on

24:54.961 --> 24:56.262
employment opportunities.

24:58.665 --> 24:59.699
Can we get
a job there?

24:59.732 --> 25:01.133
Abby, click
"computer programming."

25:01.167 --> 25:04.103
"We're looking for
a computer programmer

25:04.136 --> 25:05.972
"with experience in
network protocols

25:06.005 --> 25:07.707
"IDS,

25:07.740 --> 25:10.643
"firewalls, and ultra high-speed
network capabilities.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.679
"Excellent
communication skills,

25:12.712 --> 25:15.114
"a professional attitude
and the desire to be challenged

25:15.147 --> 25:16.549
"every day is required.

25:16.583 --> 25:17.950
"Bachelor's degrees
preferred.

25:17.984 --> 25:20.553
Must be able
to start immediately."

25:20.587 --> 25:21.520
Way to go, Kate.

25:21.554 --> 25:23.289
Finally, I get to do
some undercover work.

25:23.322 --> 25:24.323
That's not going to work.

25:24.356 --> 25:25.324
Uh, probie's got cop

25:25.357 --> 25:26.826
written all over

25:26.859 --> 25:27.827
his face.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.128
I, on the other hand...

25:29.161 --> 25:32.231
He does have experience
with cyber... sex.

25:32.264 --> 25:35.067
Yeah.
That true, DiNozzo?

25:35.101 --> 25:36.736
I think what Kate meant
to say was

25:36.769 --> 25:38.270
that I met a very nice girl
online once.

25:38.304 --> 25:39.972
Yeah, what was
her name?

25:41.240 --> 25:43.976
Names aren't that important.

25:45.845 --> 25:48.280
Hotjuggs24, but I think
she meant it as a metaphor.

25:48.314 --> 25:49.649
McGEE:
Boss, Tony could never pass

25:49.682 --> 25:50.783
as a computer programmer.

25:50.817 --> 25:52.218
So McGee goes.

25:52.251 --> 25:53.986
No.

25:54.020 --> 25:55.655
Not McGee.

25:58.290 --> 26:00.893
WOMAN:
You make me really horny, baby.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.070
MAN:
Well, you're
certainly qualified.

26:11.103 --> 26:13.606
And from the look of things,
you'll fit right in around here.

26:13.640 --> 26:16.075
So what do you think,
Ms. Gibbs?

26:16.108 --> 26:17.677
ABBY:
Um...

26:17.710 --> 26:18.978
I'd say,

26:19.011 --> 26:21.013
when can I start, Mr. Kane?

26:21.047 --> 26:22.649
You can call me Devon.

26:22.682 --> 26:24.851
Right. Devon.

26:24.884 --> 26:25.852
What am I wearing?

26:25.885 --> 26:28.320
How do you like
fishnets, baby?

26:29.188 --> 26:30.256
You can start today.

26:30.289 --> 26:32.024
I have a question
for you, though.

26:32.058 --> 26:35.294
Have you thought about
modeling yourself?

26:35.327 --> 26:37.664
Oh, I prefer
the computer programming

26:37.697 --> 26:40.032
side of the business, Devon.

26:40.066 --> 26:42.368
Okay, well, should you
change your mind

26:42.401 --> 26:44.370
we do offer naked tech support

26:44.403 --> 26:47.707
to a very select clientele.

26:47.740 --> 26:48.875
And it pays double.

26:48.908 --> 26:51.911
That's... very thoughtful,

26:51.944 --> 26:54.080
but, um, I'll pass.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.247
Okay, great.

26:55.281 --> 26:57.416
Well, here's your
work station.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.051
And I think that's it.

26:59.085 --> 27:00.286
So...

27:00.319 --> 27:01.754
welcome to Scarlet Secret.

27:02.889 --> 27:04.223
Good work, Abby.

27:04.256 --> 27:05.257
Go.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.959
Get Jeremy Davison's statement.

27:06.993 --> 27:08.895
I want the name of anybody
he's had an altercation with

27:08.928 --> 27:09.696
in the past five years.

27:09.729 --> 27:10.930
BOTH:
You got it.

27:16.002 --> 27:17.136
I'm in, Gibbs.

27:17.169 --> 27:18.337
Is McGee there?

27:18.370 --> 27:19.205
Here, Abbs.

27:19.238 --> 27:20.206
Hi, McGee.

27:20.239 --> 27:21.107
Hey.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.409
Okay, open port 618
on their firewall,

27:23.442 --> 27:24.844
and I'll join you.

27:26.312 --> 27:27.947
Done, and done.

27:29.782 --> 27:30.750
Connected.

27:30.783 --> 27:32.384
How long is this
going to take?

27:32.418 --> 27:34.320
There's a number
of different variables.

27:34.353 --> 27:35.755
Code complexity,

27:35.788 --> 27:36.923
accuracy of the logs,

27:36.956 --> 27:37.924
the software...

27:37.957 --> 27:39.025
You've got one hour.

27:39.058 --> 27:41.027
Or one hour.

27:41.060 --> 27:42.795
DAVISON:
So... so if it wasn't Laura

27:42.829 --> 27:45.431
I was talking to,
who was it?

27:45.464 --> 27:48.200
Well, that's what we're
trying to find out,
Mr. Davison.

27:48.234 --> 27:50.302
( stuttering )
No, I don't believe it.

27:50.336 --> 27:51.838
We talked about everything.

27:51.871 --> 27:53.272
It wasn't just about sex.

27:53.305 --> 27:54.473
She loved me.

27:54.506 --> 27:55.975
It can't be.

27:56.008 --> 27:59.211
At this point, we're not
even sure if she is a she.

27:59.245 --> 28:03.115
We exchanged
hundreds of e-mails.

28:03.149 --> 28:04.717
Why would someone do that?

28:04.751 --> 28:06.719
You tell us.

28:06.753 --> 28:09.722
Anyone holding a grudge
against you, Mr. Davison?

28:09.756 --> 28:11.858
Anyone who might know
their way around a computer?

28:11.891 --> 28:14.861
No, I don't socialize
much off-line.

28:14.894 --> 28:17.797
I kind of s-stutter
when I'm nervous.

28:17.830 --> 28:18.831
What about on-line?

28:18.865 --> 28:19.899
I said no.

28:19.932 --> 28:21.768
Maybe...

28:21.801 --> 28:23.502
maybe she didn't recognize me.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.337
Maybe it was just a mistake.

28:25.371 --> 28:27.506
I-If I talk to her, we can...

28:27.539 --> 28:28.607
She never even heard
of you, Jeremy.

28:28.640 --> 28:31.477
Whoever you were talking to,
it wasn't Laura Rowans.

28:31.510 --> 28:33.913
( sniffling )

28:33.946 --> 28:36.348
So none of it was real?

28:36.382 --> 28:40.753
The whole thing was just
some sick joke?

28:40.787 --> 28:42.254
Jeremy. Oh, God.

28:42.288 --> 28:43.790
Are you okay?

28:44.857 --> 28:46.425
Is this

28:46.458 --> 28:48.094
really necessary,
Agent Todd?

28:49.228 --> 28:51.163
Not anymore.

28:57.503 --> 28:59.806
If you remember anything,
Jeremy,

28:59.839 --> 29:01.874
anything that you think
might help us,

29:01.908 --> 29:04.844
please call me.

29:04.877 --> 29:07.313
It's going to be
all right now, okay?

29:07.346 --> 29:09.148
It's going to be all right.

29:13.252 --> 29:14.286
I got him.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.221
It's custom code.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.056
It matches the stuff
on Laura's computer.

29:17.089 --> 29:19.191
He's got hooks
all over the system.

29:19.225 --> 29:20.526
I'm on it.

29:21.527 --> 29:23.362
Okay, he's using a router

29:23.395 --> 29:24.530
out of Fairfax.

29:24.563 --> 29:25.865
Tracing it back now.

29:27.066 --> 29:28.968
Interesting.

29:29.001 --> 29:31.170
He left his name
in an encrypted file.

29:31.203 --> 29:32.905
Zed-death-six.

29:32.939 --> 29:34.273
The guy's arrogant.

29:34.306 --> 29:36.208
He likes to sign his work.

29:37.376 --> 29:38.577
What?

29:38.610 --> 29:40.880
I talk to myself.
Got a problem with that?

29:44.416 --> 29:46.052
What?

29:49.588 --> 29:50.823
Got him.

29:53.192 --> 29:54.526
Name's Victor Grotinski.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.228
He's in Woodbridge,
Virginia,

29:56.262 --> 29:57.363
off Davis Ford Road.

29:57.396 --> 29:58.564
15 miles from Quantico.

30:00.199 --> 30:01.567
That's a good job, McGee.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.402
You get Abby back here.

30:03.435 --> 30:04.536
Coffee's for you.
DiNozzo.

30:04.570 --> 30:05.537
Yeah, boss.

30:05.571 --> 30:07.840
Meet me at
this address.

30:10.977 --> 30:12.544
( contented sigh )

30:51.683 --> 30:53.619
NCIS Federal agents!

30:53.652 --> 30:55.621
We have a warrant
for your arrest.

31:01.593 --> 31:03.229
Hands in the air.

31:03.262 --> 31:03.996
Now!

31:20.012 --> 31:21.680
That's, uh...

31:21.713 --> 31:24.917
That is just nasty.

31:24.951 --> 31:26.652
Oh, my God.

31:44.503 --> 31:46.105
( camera shutter clicking )

31:46.138 --> 31:48.207
You see anything
interesting, Duck?

31:48.240 --> 31:51.077
They say the eyes are the window

31:51.110 --> 31:52.278
to the soul.

31:52.311 --> 31:55.314
Yeah? They say anything
about when he died?

31:55.347 --> 31:56.282
Perhaps.

31:56.315 --> 31:58.150
Have we found them yet?

31:58.184 --> 31:59.151
Nope.

31:59.185 --> 32:01.020
They took the
optic nerve.

32:01.053 --> 32:01.887
Time of death...

32:01.920 --> 32:04.356
( camera shutter clicking )

32:04.390 --> 32:07.026
...about 18 hours ago.

32:09.461 --> 32:10.362
What do you think
this is?

32:10.396 --> 32:12.531
Tony, he was slaving old systems
together.

32:12.564 --> 32:14.400
He was jerry-rigging
his own super computer.

32:17.269 --> 32:18.304
I talking about this.

32:18.337 --> 32:20.006
Some kind of solvent?

32:20.039 --> 32:21.307
I don't think so.

32:23.342 --> 32:25.244
Oh, I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

32:25.277 --> 32:26.112
You know what this is?

32:26.145 --> 32:29.281
( clanking and clattering )

32:29.315 --> 32:30.282
Hey!

32:30.316 --> 32:32.151
Hi... guys.

32:32.184 --> 32:34.153
No, I don't,
but considering

32:34.186 --> 32:37.289
there's no bathroom
in this apartment...?

32:39.125 --> 32:40.592
Uh, probie...
bag that.

32:41.760 --> 32:42.995
And why don't
you check out

32:43.029 --> 32:45.998
those suspicious-
looking containers
while you're at it.

32:47.699 --> 32:48.600
Ugh!

32:48.634 --> 32:50.436
I think
I'll throw up now.

32:54.606 --> 32:57.009
DiNozzo...

32:57.043 --> 32:58.177
find out what
this operates.

32:58.210 --> 33:00.579
You got it.

33:00.612 --> 33:04.183
Kate, what do you think
about Oedipus here

33:04.216 --> 33:07.286
( sighing ):
Well, there's no obvious
defensive wounds.

33:07.319 --> 33:09.321
He knew his attacker.

33:09.355 --> 33:11.290
Or he was surprised.

33:11.323 --> 33:12.691
Why take his eyes?

33:12.724 --> 33:14.493
Some kind of a message?

33:14.526 --> 33:15.761
DUCKY:
Or a warning, Kate.

33:15.794 --> 33:18.330
Several South American tribes
were known

33:18.364 --> 33:20.499
to ritualistically
pluck the eyes

33:20.532 --> 33:21.600
of their enemies...

33:21.633 --> 33:22.568
( shutter clicking )

33:22.601 --> 33:25.204
...to discourage them
from being followed.

33:25.237 --> 33:27.273
Of course, they were cannibals,
so they did...

33:27.306 --> 33:29.141
GIBBS:
You know, I don't think we're
dealing with cannibals

33:29.175 --> 33:30.142
here, Duck.

33:30.176 --> 33:31.343
No, I should
think not.

33:31.377 --> 33:34.313
Well, not this far north.

33:34.346 --> 33:35.281
Kate, could you come here
for a second?

33:35.314 --> 33:37.216
I need your help
with something.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.787
I need you to climb
on top of me.

33:43.255 --> 33:45.357
I had to wear a skirt today.

33:45.391 --> 33:47.359
Did you say something?

33:47.393 --> 33:50.062
KATE:
Oh, you know,
you realize what would happen

33:50.096 --> 33:51.430
if I dropped this knife,
Tony?

33:51.463 --> 33:54.533
Yep. I'm still deciding
whether it's worth it or not.

34:08.280 --> 34:11.283
Now, why would somebody hide
a camcorder in a vent?

34:11.317 --> 34:13.152
( laughing ):
You're kidding, right?

34:14.353 --> 34:16.122
Aw... You know,
when this is over,

34:16.155 --> 34:17.556
we really need to talk, Kate.

34:17.589 --> 34:19.325
You scare me.

34:19.358 --> 34:21.227
( beep )

34:21.260 --> 34:23.295
( man and woman
moaning passionately )

34:23.329 --> 34:24.563
Eww!

34:24.596 --> 34:26.298
Whoa...

34:26.332 --> 34:27.733
( moaning continues )

34:27.766 --> 34:29.368
Ew.

34:29.401 --> 34:32.304
ABBY:
Well, he certainly isn't

34:32.338 --> 34:34.806
gonna win any awards
for cinematography.

34:34.840 --> 34:37.743
And it didn't help that he was
shooting in almost no light.

34:37.776 --> 34:40.179
Okay, here's where
it gets interesting.

34:40.212 --> 34:41.547
( man and woman moan
passionately )

34:41.580 --> 34:43.149
( woman giggles )

34:43.182 --> 34:45.617
( liquid squishing,
man groans in pain )

34:49.288 --> 34:51.457
ABBY:
She's a black widow.

34:51.490 --> 34:53.759
She killed him right after...

34:53.792 --> 34:55.361
that special moment.

34:55.394 --> 34:57.796
Any close-ups of her face?

34:57.829 --> 35:00.199
One glimpse, but I mean
it's a glimpse.

35:01.267 --> 35:04.270
It's digital, so...

35:04.303 --> 35:06.505
I might be able
to pull out more information.

35:08.674 --> 35:12.411
I'll do my best to pull out
more information...?

35:13.345 --> 35:16.515
I will pull out
more information.

35:18.417 --> 35:21.320
Hey, McGee...
Yeah.

35:21.353 --> 35:22.488
I need to know
who hired Grotinski

35:22.521 --> 35:24.456
to create the e-mail trail
between Rowans and Davison.

35:24.490 --> 35:27.193
Well, there's about
150 gigabytes of data

35:27.226 --> 35:28.494
on several hard drives, boss.

35:28.527 --> 35:29.295
Only 150?

35:29.328 --> 35:30.896
Hell!
( pats shoulder )

35:30.929 --> 35:32.631
That shouldn't take
much time at all!

35:34.333 --> 35:36.602
He has no idea what a gigabyte
is, does he, Abby?

35:36.635 --> 35:39.905
I don't think he knows
what a hard drive is, McGee.

35:39.938 --> 35:41.607
TONY:
I mean, the policy
they have at that beach

35:41.640 --> 35:42.474
isn't strictly nudist,

35:42.508 --> 35:45.344
it's more of like, uh,
it's optional.

35:45.377 --> 35:46.512
WOMAN:
Uh-huh. Yeah.

35:46.545 --> 35:47.446
Ooh! Changed!

35:47.479 --> 35:50.516
We're dealing with
a sociopath here, Tony.

35:50.549 --> 35:53.652
Yeah, the missing eye part would
be the dead giveaway, Kate.

35:53.685 --> 35:56.322
Who likes to
manipulate people.
But the question is:

35:56.355 --> 35:58.724
why Jeremy Davison
and Laura Rowans?

35:58.757 --> 36:02.428
Two lonely people pouring their
hearts out into cyberspace?

36:02.461 --> 36:04.363
Instead they find a psycho
lurking on the

36:04.396 --> 36:05.731
Scarlet Secret Web site.

36:05.764 --> 36:07.466
Works for me.

36:07.499 --> 36:08.367
Not me.

36:08.400 --> 36:09.768
We're being played.

36:09.801 --> 36:11.937
By who, Gibbs?

36:11.970 --> 36:14.506
Kate, Grotinski was murdered
by the woman on the tape.

36:14.540 --> 36:15.941
She hired him?

36:15.974 --> 36:16.975
I don't know yet.

36:17.008 --> 36:19.211
We should bring Laura Rowans
back for questioning.

36:19.245 --> 36:21.280
( phone ringing )

36:21.313 --> 36:23.315
Yeah. Gibbs.

36:23.349 --> 36:25.751
On our way.

36:25.784 --> 36:28.220
Let's go.
Ducky's got something.

36:30.722 --> 36:33.525
To Abby please,
Mr. Palmer.

36:33.559 --> 36:34.426
Sure thing, Doctor.

36:34.460 --> 36:37.296
Uh, what is it exactly?

36:37.329 --> 36:39.431
Our young man was
killed during coitus.

36:39.465 --> 36:42.501
That may be our
black widow's DNA.

36:44.470 --> 36:46.538
You know,
the Romans considered dying

36:46.572 --> 36:49.275
during the act of love
to be a great honor,

36:49.308 --> 36:50.842
Mr. Grotinski.

36:50.876 --> 36:52.544
Yeah? What would they think
about videotaping it?

36:52.578 --> 36:53.912
From some of the murals

36:53.945 --> 36:57.416
I've seen in Pompeii,
I think they'd rather enjoy it.

36:57.449 --> 36:59.485
It's an Italian thing, Ducky.

36:59.518 --> 37:01.520
We're passionate people;
it runs in our blood.

37:01.553 --> 37:04.490
The only thing running
through your blood, Tony,

37:04.523 --> 37:05.557
is cholesterol.

37:05.591 --> 37:06.858
And possibly chlamydia.

37:06.892 --> 37:07.859
It's curable.

37:07.893 --> 37:09.495
What do we got, Duck?

37:09.528 --> 37:10.929
Well, I sent some
fluids up to Abby.

37:10.962 --> 37:12.731
The DNA may be our killers.

37:12.764 --> 37:14.400
But what really interests me
is the manner

37:14.433 --> 37:17.703
in which his throat was cut.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.305
The knife was
inserted into

37:19.338 --> 37:21.940
the side of the neck
and then ripped forward,

37:21.973 --> 37:25.311
severing both the arteries
and the windpipe.

37:25.344 --> 37:26.445
Very professional.

37:26.478 --> 37:29.415
Yeah.
And very familiar.

37:29.448 --> 37:30.482
Yeah.

37:30.516 --> 37:31.817
GIBBS:
Thanks, Duck.

37:31.850 --> 37:33.885
You track down Laura Rowans.

37:33.919 --> 37:35.521
Tell her we
need to talk.

37:37.456 --> 37:38.624
Duck...?

37:38.657 --> 37:40.859
Oh, it's the technique
Marines are taught

37:40.892 --> 37:43.028
to kill enemy sentries.

37:43.061 --> 37:46.532
Her hubby taught her how
to do a lot more than
just shoot.

37:46.565 --> 37:49.901
ABBY:
I'm picking up some highlights
off the baseball cap.

37:49.935 --> 37:51.570
No, that's not good enough.
I need a face.

37:51.603 --> 37:52.738
How much longer,
Abby?

37:52.771 --> 37:53.905
Maybe another hour to filter.

37:53.939 --> 37:55.474
What about the fluid
Ducky sent up?

37:55.507 --> 37:57.509
I've isolated several
female cells.

37:57.543 --> 37:58.977
I'm sequencing the DNA now.

38:00.078 --> 38:02.280
Like... ten hours.

38:02.948 --> 38:04.516
You think that's
Laura Rowans, boss?

38:04.550 --> 38:05.451
Well, considering I've seen

38:05.484 --> 38:06.552
better pictures of a UFO,

38:06.585 --> 38:08.587
you tell me, McGee.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.889
Check her home; if she's there,
hold her, Sergeant.

38:10.922 --> 38:13.459
SERGEANT:
Yes, ma'am.

38:13.492 --> 38:15.527
Talked to
Laura's mother, boss.

38:15.561 --> 38:16.995
She claims she hasn't seen her
since yesterday

38:17.028 --> 38:18.397
and she's not answering
her cell.

38:18.430 --> 38:20.366
KATE:
She's not answering
at home, either.

38:20.399 --> 38:22.501
I have Sergeant Hagerty
heading over there.
You try the hospital?

38:22.534 --> 38:26.104
No, but if she's at
the plucking eyeball stage...?

38:26.137 --> 38:27.606
She might take another shot
at Jeremy.

38:30.376 --> 38:31.510
We're going to Quantico.

38:32.411 --> 38:34.079
Let's roll.

38:34.112 --> 38:35.514
( phone ringing )

38:35.547 --> 38:36.682
ICU. Lieutenant Kim.

38:36.715 --> 38:38.517
Hi. It's Tony.

38:38.550 --> 38:40.552
Tony!
I was hoping you'd call.

38:40.586 --> 38:42.554
What's Jeremy Davison's
condition?

38:42.588 --> 38:43.789
Uh...

38:43.822 --> 38:45.391
Resting comfortably.
What's up?

38:45.424 --> 38:46.458
All right.
Anyone comes to visit him,

38:46.492 --> 38:48.560
tell them he's been transferred
to another hospital.

38:48.594 --> 38:49.661
Is there a problem, Tony?

38:49.695 --> 38:50.996
No. No problem, Pam.

38:51.029 --> 38:52.664
We'll be on base
in about 15 minutes.

38:52.698 --> 38:54.500
( revving )

38:54.533 --> 38:55.634
( strained ):
Make that ten.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.569
You going to tell us
what's up, Gibbs?

38:57.603 --> 38:58.604
My gut.

38:58.637 --> 38:59.738
( phone ringing )

38:59.771 --> 39:00.806
Agent Todd.

39:00.839 --> 39:03.141
Yeah, we've got a serious
situation here, ma'am.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.376
( door opening )

39:04.410 --> 39:07.679
HAGERTY:
Hands in the air!

39:07.713 --> 39:08.914
Now!
( gasps )

39:08.947 --> 39:10.616
( glass shattering )

39:20.125 --> 39:22.561
Sergeant Hagerty has Laura
Rowans in custody, Gibbs.

39:22.594 --> 39:25.130
And he also found Grotinski's
eyes in her kitchen.

39:25.163 --> 39:27.098
She hired him
to make it look like

39:27.132 --> 39:28.800
a third party
set them both up?

39:28.834 --> 39:31.703
Yeah. It's not a bad plan.
It almost worked.

39:31.737 --> 39:33.472
Almost.

39:39.845 --> 39:42.113
Mrs. Rowans didn't seem like
the murdering type to me.

39:42.147 --> 39:43.915
The smart ones never do.

39:43.949 --> 39:45.751
( computer alert whistles )

39:45.784 --> 39:47.986
( beeping )

39:48.019 --> 39:49.721
I thought you told Gibbs
the DNA would take ten hours.

39:49.755 --> 39:51.623
I did.

39:52.558 --> 39:54.860
( beeping )

39:54.893 --> 39:56.895
This doesn't make any sense.
I didn't even send it.

39:56.928 --> 39:58.664
Oh, my God.

39:58.697 --> 39:59.665
You have ten minutes,

39:59.698 --> 40:02.501
and make sure all
your cell phones are off.

40:06.572 --> 40:08.840
You'll be moved to a civilian
hospital tomorrow, Mr. Davison.

40:08.874 --> 40:10.842
Finally.

40:10.876 --> 40:13.712
Any idea why this woman
fixated on my brother?

40:13.745 --> 40:17.082
I was hoping
he could tell me.

40:20.218 --> 40:21.487
( sighs softly )

40:21.520 --> 40:22.688
Jeremy?

40:25.023 --> 40:28.794
She wasn't happy, but she
wouldn't leave her husband.

40:28.827 --> 40:31.697
I was going to tell...
him about us.

40:31.730 --> 40:33.599
Well, you're lucky.

40:33.632 --> 40:35.734
We have her on tape slashing
another guy's throat.

40:36.902 --> 40:38.670
Y... You do?

40:39.971 --> 40:41.607
KATE:
The picture's damaged,

40:41.640 --> 40:43.108
but once our lab
cleans it up...

40:43.141 --> 40:45.811
TONY:
We should be able to
positively I.D. her.

40:49.581 --> 40:51.116
She won't be bothering you
again, Mr. Davison.

40:52.651 --> 40:55.954
I... I loved her.

40:58.624 --> 41:00.626
Let's go.

41:09.968 --> 41:12.504
Come on,
answer, answer, answer.

41:12.538 --> 41:13.605
Pick up, damn it!

41:13.639 --> 41:14.706
Pick up!

41:14.740 --> 41:15.774
If they're at the hospital,

41:15.807 --> 41:17.709
they probably have their phones
turned off, Abby.

41:17.743 --> 41:19.077
We're about to let a murderer
go free!

41:26.818 --> 41:28.654
We have to get going, baby.

41:30.789 --> 41:34.059
ICU! I need to speak to Special
Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs now!

41:34.092 --> 41:35.694
It's a matter of life and death.

41:47.238 --> 41:49.708
Those first two Navy cops
were dumb,

41:49.741 --> 41:51.810
but their boss wasn't.
Did you see the way he was

41:51.843 --> 41:53.612
looking at me?

41:53.645 --> 41:55.847
TONY:
Hey...

41:55.881 --> 41:57.583
that sound harsh to you, Kate?

41:57.616 --> 41:58.984
Very.

42:04.322 --> 42:05.591
Go for it, honey.

42:05.624 --> 42:06.958
My first round's going through

42:06.992 --> 42:08.660
your right eye socket, lady.

42:13.932 --> 42:17.002
( phone ringing )

42:18.704 --> 42:20.005
Yeah. Gibbs.

42:20.038 --> 42:21.707
Don't you pick up your phone
anymore?!

42:21.740 --> 42:23.609
The DNA we ran on Jeremy Davison
two days ago--

42:23.642 --> 42:25.243
matches five
open investigations.

42:25.276 --> 42:26.912
He's a serial rapist
and murderer!

42:26.945 --> 42:28.179
We know.

42:28.213 --> 42:30.048
And the woman that he's with
is his accomplice,

42:30.081 --> 42:31.950
it's not his...

42:31.983 --> 42:33.184
You know?!

42:33.218 --> 42:35.921
Got it covered, Abby.

42:37.789 --> 42:38.890
They know.

42:43.328 --> 42:44.295
Did you know?

42:44.329 --> 42:46.331
No.

42:46.364 --> 42:48.834
If I find out
that you knew,

42:48.867 --> 42:50.301
I will kill you.

42:54.806 --> 42:56.608
( Kate laughs )

42:56.642 --> 42:58.810
I can't believe we almost
let those two walk.

42:58.844 --> 43:01.246
And Davison isn't even
their real names.

43:01.279 --> 43:03.915
Grotinski created
those identities for them.

43:03.949 --> 43:06.051
Yeah, it's amazing what
you can do with computers

43:06.084 --> 43:07.285
these days, Kate.

43:07.318 --> 43:08.787
McGEE:
Sure is, Tony.

43:08.820 --> 43:10.989
Hey, I've got a little something

43:11.022 --> 43:13.058
you might be interested in.

43:15.126 --> 43:16.628
Who's this supposed to be?

43:16.662 --> 43:20.298
I tracked down your cyber babe
for you: Hotjuggs24.

43:20.331 --> 43:22.901
( Kate snickers )

43:26.738 --> 43:28.674
Yeah, she's a real keeper,
DiNozzo.

43:29.975 --> 43:34.345
KATE:
I wonder if he wears
a sports bra.
