09:00.999 --> 09:03.502
We got the second key!

09:03.543 --> 09:05.045

12:06.518 --> 12:08.186
an older brother?

Oh, my God!

19:38.511 --> 19:41.055

20:17.175 --> 20:20.136
...one Halloween when I was 13..

20:20.178 --> 20:22.262
...I told dad I was

20:20.178 --> 20:22.262

20:48.372 --> 20:50.666

20:52.877 --> 20:55.546
Well, after a while you just get

20:55.588 --> 20:57.423
this little voice

20:55.588 --> 20:57.423
inside that tells you

20:57.464 --> 21:00.051
when something's dangerous.

21:00.093 --> 21:03.054

you learn to listen to it.
