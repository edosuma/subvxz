other meta-humans like me.

00:16.851 --> 00:19.092
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

I opened up our world to new threats.

is the entirety of the issue, Bany.

It might be the breach's stability,
or lack thereof.

03:50.064 --> 03:52.350
He's right. We need to think
of the breach as a door.

03:55.069 --> 03:56.149
In between we have a hallway.

03:56.320 --> 04:00.484
But the hallways constantly shifting,
twisting. collapsing upon itself.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.360
And the doors keep moving with it.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.158
So we stabilize the door,
we stabilize the hallway.

10:43.727 --> 10:47.470
So, your brother was not kidnapped.
He was pulling a job.

10:47.773 --> 10:48.888
Vlﬁth your father.

10:49.274 --> 10:50.559
M an

10:50.776 --> 10:52.641
No. Lenny would never do that.

10:52.903 --> 10:56.111
Oh, just like he would never try
and kill The Flash with his cold gun.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.063
Are you sure it was my dad?

11:00.244 --> 11:01.233

Convicted of larceny. armed robbery,

aggravated assault.
assault with a deadly weapon...

11:07.751 --> 11:09.992
You have to believe me.
Lenny would never work with him.

11:10.254 --> 11:11.414
He's a bad guy.

11:12.089 --> 11:17.083
You and your entire family are criminals.
Why should we trust anything you say?

11:24.977 --> 11:28.265
I didn't get this scar being a criminal.
I got it being a daughter.

11:36.947 --> 11:38.437
Let me go. I got this.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.365
I see you found my hiding spot.

11:46.623 --> 11:49.786
This is usually where I come to, you know,

11:51.044 --> 11:52.079
get away.

11:55.757 --> 11:59.090
First time my father came
after me. I was seven.

12:00.762 --> 12:03.139
Second time, I was eight.

12:04.516 --> 12:07.929
That's when I Ieamed that a
bottle hurts worse than a ﬁst.

12:11.481 --> 12:14.473
He used to say he was
trying to teach us lessons.

12:17.404 --> 12:21.943
I must have been a slow Ieamer
because the lessons never stopped.

12:33.879 --> 12:35.744
Lenny practically raised me.

12:37.341 --> 12:39.673
If it weren't for him,
I would have turned out a lot worse.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.296
I know.

12:42.471 --> 12:44.336
(CHUCKLES) How could I be any worse?

12:44.765 --> 12:45.845
(LAUGHS) I didn't say that.

12:46.350 --> 12:48.090
You didn't have to.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.180
But believe me. there is worse.

12:52.814 --> 12:57.558
And look, he may be a jerk brother,
but he's the only jerk brother I've got.

13:00.572 --> 13:02.153
He protected me.

13:03.158 --> 13:04.659
Now it's my turn.

13:06.328 --> 13:10.412
If he's with my dad,
he is in serious trouble.

13:14.252 --> 13:16.538
You've gotta ﬁnd out what's going on.

13:28.892 --> 13:30.974
-Hey, baby.
-Dad.

13:31.478 --> 13:32.763
What are you doing here?

13:32.980 --> 13:35.813
I came to check in on my
favorite crime-ﬁghting reporter.

13:37.442 --> 13:38.477

13:39.027 --> 13:41.439
Actually. there's something
I need to talk to you about.

13:41.655 --> 13:44.442
Hey, Iris, Editorial needs your
photos and story ASAP.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.023
Congratulations. Detective.

13:46.243 --> 13:48.985
Your daughter's expose
just made the front page.

13:49.371 --> 13:50.406
(GASPING) What?

13:51.873 --> 13:53.329
I am so happy for you.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.407
A little bitjealous,
but I'll get over it.

13:55.877 --> 13:57.538
Thanks, Linda. I... lgot lucky.

13:57.754 --> 14:00.871
No. She's being modest.
Your daughter's a serious badass.

14:01.091 --> 14:02.752
You don't have to tell me.

14:03.260 --> 14:05.546
Well, I better let you get back to work.

14:05.762 --> 14:08.014
Wait, there was something that you
wanted to talk to me about, right?

14:08.223 --> 14:10.088
Later. It can wait. Go be fabulousl

14:10.308 --> 14:11.559
(LAUGHS) Okay.

14:21.737 --> 14:24.149
Back from the dead so soon, Bany.

14:29.619 --> 14:31.610
Don't spill. it's bad luck.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.536
Why are you working with Lewis?

14:38.253 --> 14:39.663
Lisa told us you hate him.

14:40.589 --> 14:42.079
Things are...

14:44.426 --> 14:46.212
Complicated with family.

14:46.845 --> 14:48.710
As you know with your own parents, hmm?

14:49.765 --> 14:52.928
Tell me what's going on. Let me help you.

14:53.185 --> 14:56.302
Don't waste your time trying to save
people who don't want to be saved.

14:56.521 --> 14:59.012
Yeah, well, maybe it's not
just about you, right?

14:59.232 --> 15:02.690
I'm betting, whatever you two are up to,
innocent people are gonna get hurt.

15:02.903 --> 15:04.518
Don't wony. I remember our deal.

15:04.738 --> 15:07.104
You leave me alone,
I make sure no one dies.

15:08.200 --> 15:11.533
All right. You're a criminal, Snart.

15:12.621 --> 15:14.111
But you live by a code.

15:14.331 --> 15:18.165
It sounds to me like Lewis doesn't.
Like he won't care if people die.

15:20.003 --> 15:21.618
That's why I can't leave this alone.

15:24.257 --> 15:27.124
Then everyone will know who
The Flash is under that mask.

15:27.886 --> 15:29.296
I don't care.

15:30.138 --> 15:32.971
I will take you down anyway. Both of you.

15:57.582 --> 15:59.914

Why?

16:03.839 --> 16:05.045
,mﬂnnmmmm

16:05.257 --> 16:07.919
Francine did so many things wrong.

16:09.344 --> 16:10.675
Just about everything.

16:12.639 --> 16:17.554
I don't know. Now I feel like
my one wrong might be worse.

16:21.565 --> 16:22.896
Look, Joe.

16:23.775 --> 16:27.188
I've known you for,
you know, most of my life,

16:27.404 --> 16:31.488
and I know that you always have
a good reason for the decisions you make.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.907
And obviously, you were worried

16:34.119 --> 16:37.236
that Iris would go down
the wrong path if Francine raised her.

16:37.455 --> 16:38.661
I mean, look at Snart.

16:38.874 --> 16:41.957
He's a criminal because he had Lewis
for a father. That could have been me.

16:42.210 --> 16:43.541
Oh, come on. Never.

16:43.753 --> 16:45.368
Yeah, because I had you.

16:46.464 --> 16:47.795
And so did Iris.

16:48.008 --> 16:52.718
You just gotta trust in that
and tell her the truth.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.011
Yeah, how do I do that
without hurting her?

16:55.307 --> 16:56.968
She's not a little girl anymore.

16:57.184 --> 16:58.765
You should've seen her
in action the other day.

16:59.561 --> 17:01.802
Putting her neck on the line for a story.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.933
She can handle anything
that comes her way.

17:04.149 --> 17:05.389
I've just lied to her for so long,

17:05.609 --> 17:08.396
I'm scared she's not
gonna understand or forgive me.

17:08.778 --> 17:10.109
I could lose her.

17:10.322 --> 17:12.904
No. She's gonna forgive you.

17:13.867 --> 17:16.324
You just gotta give her a chance.

17:18.205 --> 17:19.240
(SIGHS)

17:22.250 --> 17:23.751
We make our move at 9:00.

17:23.960 --> 17:27.544
That's when the cleaning crews go in,
and the daytime shift leaves.

17:27.756 --> 17:31.499
Now we'll go up in the
service elevator to the 27th ﬂoor.

17:31.718 --> 17:35.711
They got a two-man team of armed guards
working the 27th to the 29th ﬂoor.

17:35.931 --> 17:37.762
But if we time it perfectly
with their shift change.

17:37.974 --> 17:39.225
we should be able to get in and out.

17:39.434 --> 17:40.890
And if timing doesn't work out?

17:41.102 --> 17:44.060
-Then those guards don't make it home.
-But if we start on the top ﬂoor,

17:44.272 --> 17:46.228

17:55.659 --> 17:57.570

for the vault hallway?

17:58.286 --> 18:01.028
Not yet. That Draycon Systems
keypad's gonna be a problem.

18:01.248 --> 18:02.283

18:02.958 --> 18:04.994
Fine. How about you?

18:05.210 --> 18:08.327
You gonna disappoint me too,
or is that freeze gun of yours

18:08.546 --> 18:11.037
gonna look after the
power source for the laser grid?

18:11.258 --> 18:12.464
It's a cold gun.

18:12.676 --> 18:15.258
And yes. But I have a better way
to get past the lasers.

18:15.470 --> 18:20.214

preliminary assessment of my own.

-Oh.
-Decapitation.

19:02.517 --> 19:03.632
-Yeah.
-Yikes.

19:03.852 --> 19:05.137
We're still recovering parts of the head,

19:05.353 --> 19:07.435
so the ID is taking
a little longer than normal.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.980
(SHOUTS) Ughl Sony.
I thought I stepped on an ear.

19:11.234 --> 19:13.190
I didn't. If I did, I'd be hearing things.

-Oh, hell no.
-(BOTH LAUGH)

19:15.363 --> 19:18.605
It doesn't look like the head was sliced
off with any weapon I'm familiar with.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.326
And I'm familiar with most weapons.

19:20.535 --> 19:21.570
Yeah, you're right.

19:21.786 --> 19:26.120
Perforation around the neck is too jagged.
It's almost like the head was blown off.

19:26.374 --> 19:29.161
Like a meta-human
who can explode heads, right?

to Leonard Snart AKA Captain Cold?

-Uh, one second. Come here.
-Sure.

19:57.113 --> 19:59.195
I think this guy is part of Snart's crew.

19:59.407 --> 20:01.648
So, Snart put a bomb in him
to keep him in line?

20:01.868 --> 20:05.235
No, Snart wouldn't do that.
But his father would.

20:05.580 --> 20:08.572
Wait, so Lewis is killing people,
and Snart's still working with him?

20:08.792 --> 20:09.872
What happened with the deal you had?

20:10.085 --> 20:11.416
Maybe he doesn't have a choice.

20:11.628 --> 20:14.540
So you think Lewis
put a bomb in his own son

20:14.756 --> 20:15.996
to force him to pull off a heist?

20:17.550 --> 20:19.211
He'd dig the bomb
out of his own head if he had to.

20:19.427 --> 20:21.918
So there must be something else
that Snart cares about.

cares about is his sister.

your mother was unresponsive.
passed out on that couch.

23:47.385 --> 23:50.798
And in that kitchen. the stove was on.

23:51.639 --> 23:54.847
There you were,
standing in front of an open ﬂame.

23:55.059 --> 23:56.469
If I hadn't gotten here when I did—

23:56.686 --> 23:58.517
Wait, my mom—

23:58.730 --> 24:00.595
Your mom was a drug addict.

24:00.815 --> 24:04.728
This wasn't the ﬁrst time
something like that had happened.

24:06.738 --> 24:10.026
I got Francine into another rehab,

24:10.241 --> 24:12.573
and a couple days later,

24:13.620 --> 24:15.201
she was gone.

24:16.205 --> 24:17.706
I looked everywhere for her, but...

24:18.708 --> 24:21.745
Vlhfe of a cop. She knew how to disappear.

24:22.754 --> 24:25.746
I couldn't stand the thought

24:27.091 --> 24:29.548
of you growing up
thinking you were abandoned.

24:29.886 --> 24:32.377
Going to sleep at night
thinking your mother left

24:32.597 --> 24:35.760
because you weren't enough to
make her stay, that you weren't loved.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.556
Because I loved you.

24:38.227 --> 24:42.140
I loved you with everything I got.

24:43.232 --> 24:44.642
Then we took Bany in.

24:45.902 --> 24:48.439
And I saw the trauma
he was going through, and I...

24:53.076 --> 24:56.068
that I did the right thing.
Not giving you that burden.

24:56.412 --> 24:59.279
What do you mean Mom left? I...

25:00.917 --> 25:02.748
I don't... I don't understand.
I don't understand.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.416
What are you telling me?

25:04.962 --> 25:06.168
Your mother's alive.

25:08.675 --> 25:10.506
She's here in Central City.

25:11.344 --> 25:13.005
She wants to see you.

25:17.934 --> 25:19.674
All these years, I thought...

25:21.854 --> 25:23.810
Dad, you told me that my...

25:24.023 --> 25:25.103
I know.

25:26.943 --> 25:30.276
I should've told you sooner,
but I couldn't ﬁgure out the right way.

25:32.281 --> 25:33.817
And the mother you thought you remember,

25:35.451 --> 25:38.033
the perfect mother in the stories
I made up for you,

25:38.287 --> 25:42.530
that is the mother you deserved.
And I knew Francine couldn't be like that.

25:42.792 --> 25:44.282
She would only break your heart.

25:48.131 --> 25:49.621
I'm so sony.

25:53.010 --> 25:54.966
k 0 BBIN

25:59.308 --> 26:00.559
.IFFI

26:01.644 --> 26:03.805
It's okay. I understand.

26:05.022 --> 26:07.149
You were just trying to keep me safe.

26:17.201 --> 26:21.820
The micro-bomb casing must be made
of some kind of a ferromagnetic material.

26:21.998 --> 26:24.831
Once you hold it steady with the magnet,
I can surgically excise it.

26:25.001 --> 26:26.036
Put the magnet downl

26:26.586 --> 26:28.497
This is a really concentrated bomb.

26:28.671 --> 26:32.038
It's gonna combust if it's exposed
to magnetic friction and an oxidant.

26:34.010 --> 26:35.341
What's he talking about?

26:36.179 --> 26:37.339
-Air.
-Uh...

26:37.555 --> 26:40.592
The... The bomb will explode
if it comes in contact with air.

26:40.850 --> 26:42.932
Don't wony. Lisa. We're gonna ﬁnd
another way to get it out.

26:43.352 --> 26:45.934
Scientiﬁc minds. can we confer, please?

26:46.189 --> 26:48.100
What if The Flash speed-extracts it?

26:48.357 --> 26:49.563
No. It's too risky.

26:49.776 --> 26:52.233
I'm gonna ﬁnd a way to get it out,
I just need a little time.

26:52.445 --> 26:54.606
Well, we need to keep track of Lewis

26:54.864 --> 26:56.570
until you ﬁgure out
how to disarm the bomb.

26:56.783 --> 26:59.570
I wish we knew what he was
gonna steal next. And when.

26:59.869 --> 27:01.530
Maybe I can get them to tell me.

27:02.079 --> 27:03.205
Their tech guy is dead.

27:03.372 --> 27:05.033
So I'm betting they're
gonna need a new one.

27:05.875 --> 27:08.116
I'm saying I'm gonna
inﬁltrate Lewis' crew.

27:08.377 --> 27:09.958
You're going to pretend to be a criminal?

27:10.963 --> 27:12.214
:mmmnm

27:18.221 --> 27:20.428

27:22.892 --> 27:24.382

27:24.769 --> 27:27.886
-I told you. I don't need saving.
-(GUN POWERING UP)

27:29.232 --> 27:30.472
But your sister does.

27:31.734 --> 27:34.396
I know your dad put a bomb in Lisa.

27:35.238 --> 27:38.230
And Lewis told you he'd kill her
if you didn't help him, right?

27:38.407 --> 27:39.442
Look, don't wony.

27:39.617 --> 27:42.074
My team's working on a way
to remove the bomb.

27:42.286 --> 27:45.323
Hope you got that gun of yours
ready to blast 'cause...

27:46.165 --> 27:47.245
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

27:48.584 --> 27:50.415
-Who the hell is this?
-Uh, I'm...

27:50.628 --> 27:52.584
Lenny said you need a new tech.

27:54.090 --> 27:56.422
What's up? I'm... I'm Sam. What's up?

27:58.636 --> 27:59.671
(CHUCKLES)

28:01.514 --> 28:05.006
You're telling me you think this kid
can crack a Draycon keypad?

28:05.268 --> 28:08.101
Well, I did help Snart steal
the Kahndaq Dynasty Diamond

28:08.271 --> 28:09.932
from Central City Museum last year.

28:10.106 --> 28:13.439
That was locked up behind an AmerTek
Industries Phase Three Suppression Door

28:13.651 --> 28:15.516
with a Draycon XL-1218 keypad.

28:15.778 --> 28:16.767
(CHUCKLES) So...

28:18.781 --> 28:20.692
Couldn't have done it without him.

28:20.950 --> 28:22.156
Draycon's my jam.

28:22.451 --> 28:23.440
Ah...

28:28.624 --> 28:31.991
Okay, Sam. Let's go.

28:32.962 --> 28:33.997
Right now?

28:34.630 --> 28:36.336
You got a problem with that?

28:36.549 --> 28:38.631
No. All good. Can't wait.

28:44.640 --> 28:45.971
Oh, this should be fun.

29:38.027 --> 29:39.107
I got it.

29:43.366 --> 29:44.401
It's two armed guards.

29:44.617 --> 29:46.357
Guess your timing
didn't work out after all.

29:46.535 --> 29:48.196
Yeah, that's why we got a Plan B.

29:48.371 --> 29:49.781
'Cause you always needed one.

29:50.873 --> 29:52.033
Yeah, but...

to be a disappointment also.

we get on with the job?

31:19.795 --> 31:21.410
What are you going
to do to me with that thing?

31:21.630 --> 31:24.007
Operating pressure on this
is over 1,000 PSI.

31:24.258 --> 31:26.465
This will easily suck the
micro-bomb out of her neck

31:26.635 --> 31:29.468
and into the barrel of this
with one high-powered shot.

31:30.765 --> 31:33.427
There is one slight risk.

31:33.642 --> 31:36.634
Besides shooting a high-powered
weapon directly against my neck?

31:37.313 --> 31:40.476
The gun does use compressed air.

through dispatch, it gets all jammed up.

37:43.971 --> 37:45.086
rmnmi'm

37:45.305 --> 37:48.012
And as law enforcement colleagues,
efﬁciency is important.

37:48.267 --> 37:49.507
Yes. it is. No, that's...

37:49.768 --> 37:51.804
Yeah.
That's exactly what I was thinking too.

37:52.187 --> 37:53.802
Okay, great. Awesome.

37:54.273 --> 37:55.854
-Okay, I'll see you.
-Yeah.

37:57.276 --> 37:58.686
Just kidding. Okay.

37:59.111 --> 38:00.692
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

38:04.700 --> 38:06.190
So, taking off?

38:06.368 --> 38:07.824
Thought I'd say goodbye.

38:08.203 --> 38:09.363
And thank you.

38:09.955 --> 38:12.196
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't leave a bomb in anyone.

38:12.458 --> 38:13.538
Not even you.

38:16.170 --> 38:18.161
You were there for me
when I was feeling weak.

38:18.714 --> 38:20.375
I hate feeling weak.

38:20.716 --> 38:24.129
It's hard for me to trust people,
but I trusted you.

38:26.388 --> 38:29.972
You know, you might actually
be my ﬁrst real friend.

38:32.060 --> 38:33.516
Is any of that true?

38:49.161 --> 38:51.072
Until next time, Cisco.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.412
-Later, Golden Glider.

39:19.733 --> 39:21.940
Dudes, you actually built the thing.

39:22.194 --> 39:24.685
MARTIN: Mr. Ganick, lam...
I am quite impressed

39:24.905 --> 39:27.612
by what you've accomplished
during my recent wellness hiatus.

39:28.116 --> 39:29.276
-Have you tested it out yet?
-Not yet.

39:29.535 --> 39:30.775
Hm [-It m m:

39:31.787 --> 39:34.028
No, no, no, no! Now that I...

39:34.248 --> 39:37.866
Now that I am back to optimal health,
please. allow me.

mar-111

39:43.757 --> 39:44.917
How did you stabilize it?

39:45.133 --> 39:47.124
-CFL quark matter.
-Ahl

39:47.302 --> 39:49.759
CISCO: Negative energy density
with positive surface pressure.

39:49.972 --> 39:53.089
-It's geniusl
-You created CFL Quark Matter?

39:53.308 --> 39:55.560
It's something we perfected on my Earth.
I'll show you some time.

39:55.978 --> 39:58.390
You mean,
sometime in the next few minutes?

40:00.649 --> 40:01.638
Oh...

40:02.150 --> 40:03.811
Yeah, I guess this is it, huh?

40:05.320 --> 40:06.981
Time for me to go back home.

40:07.823 --> 40:11.486
Right now? I mean, we still need
your help with the breachers.

40:11.827 --> 40:13.738
My ﬁrst priority is Zoom.

40:14.121 --> 40:16.737
I need to ﬁnd out what he's up to.
How he stole my speed.

40:16.957 --> 40:18.322
But you can do that here.

40:18.500 --> 40:20.001
And, you know, if you go back

40:20.168 --> 40:23.660
then we can't get in touch with you
when we need your help,

40:23.839 --> 40:25.500
or with Zoom,

40:28.677 --> 40:31.009
It would be nice to be able to
pick your brain every once in a while.

40:31.263 --> 40:32.298
Get some more speedster tips.

40:33.849 --> 40:34.929
JAY: Hmm.

40:39.021 --> 40:42.980
Okay.
Once we take care of Zoom, I'm going home.

40:43.859 --> 40:45.440
-That's fair.
-Good. (LAUGHS)

40:46.111 --> 40:48.773
'Cause I could use a shower
and a shave, and some sunlight.

40:48.989 --> 40:50.024
(ALL LAUGH)

40:50.532 --> 40:52.648
I'll, uh, see you later.

40:54.369 --> 40:57.031
So, Professor Stein, how are you feeling?

40:57.205 --> 41:01.494
Well, uh, it appears that
a little rest heals all maladies.

41:01.710 --> 41:03.621
(STAMMERING) I couldn't feel—

41:04.296 --> 41:06.207

-Professor?

41:06.548 --> 41:07.958
No, no, no, no. Get back! Come herel

Professor Stein, can you hear me?

41:21.563 --> 41:22.803
-Professor Stein?
-What happened to him?

41:23.023 --> 41:24.979
He... He went up like Firestorm,
but the ﬂame, why was it blue?

41:25.192 --> 41:27.729
I don't know. This isn't good.
We need to stabilize him fast.
