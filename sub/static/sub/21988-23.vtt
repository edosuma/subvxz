00:19.628 --> 00:21.412
Phil loved that boat.

00:21.456 --> 00:22.979
Enough to go down with it?

00:23.023 --> 00:24.763
Apparently.

00:24.807 --> 00:26.504
She was a beauty.

00:26.548 --> 00:28.376
Shame the Coast Guard
couldn't recover her.

00:29.594 --> 00:31.640
Or him.

00:37.385 --> 00:40.388
Fair winds and following seas,
Phil.

00:41.693 --> 00:44.348
Hey, you wouldn't be Gibbs?

00:44.392 --> 00:45.741
Phil talked about you
all the time.

00:45.784 --> 00:47.308
You helped him build
his boat, right?

00:47.351 --> 00:49.266
Hell of a guy.

00:49.310 --> 00:51.138
Hell of a loss.

00:51.181 --> 00:54.358
Yeah.

00:54.402 --> 00:55.446
Thanks for coming, Jethro.

00:55.490 --> 00:58.101
It really means a lot.

00:58.145 --> 00:59.668
Wish we could've
done more.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.280
Oh, no.
NCIS has been great.

01:03.324 --> 01:05.761
So has the Coast Guard.

01:05.804 --> 01:08.720
You and I both know

01:08.764 --> 01:11.288
that Phil should not have been
sailing in that weather.

01:11.332 --> 01:14.552
And we also know
that when he's on leave,

01:14.596 --> 01:17.251
nothing's going to stop him.

01:17.294 --> 01:18.948
Stubborn son of a bitch.

01:18.991 --> 01:22.256
Yeah. You two
and your projects.

01:22.299 --> 01:25.433
I got to say, I never
understood the appeal.

01:25.476 --> 01:27.348
Bourbon and boats, Marce.

01:27.391 --> 01:29.393
Don't overthink it.

01:31.961 --> 01:34.746
In that case, maybe...

01:34.790 --> 01:36.444
maybe you could
do me a favor.

01:36.487 --> 01:38.098
Sure. Name it.

01:38.141 --> 01:41.492
:
Phil's tools.

01:41.536 --> 01:42.798
Take anything you like.

01:42.841 --> 01:45.366
Ah. Come on, Marcy.No, really.

01:45.409 --> 01:46.671
He would want you
to have them.

01:46.715 --> 01:50.458
I don't... I don't even know
what's down there.

01:50.501 --> 01:52.677
Please, Jethro?

01:52.721 --> 01:55.724
Okay. I'll take a look.

02:19.878 --> 02:22.359
♪

03:15.499 --> 03:17.501
About damn time.
Whoa!

03:17.545 --> 03:19.068
Phil: Gibbs.

03:19.111 --> 03:20.765
What the hell?!Shh, shh!

03:23.594 --> 03:25.814
♪

04:05.506 --> 04:07.682
I still can't believe
she's really gone.

04:07.725 --> 04:10.511
BISHOP:
Uh, hello?

04:10.554 --> 04:12.600
McGee?

04:12.643 --> 04:13.731
What are you doing here?

04:13.775 --> 04:14.863
Bishop, I thought you left.

04:14.906 --> 04:16.430
No, it's not 9:00 yet.

04:16.473 --> 04:18.301
I have the lab
from 8:45 to 9:00.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.216
You have it from 9:00 to 9:15.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.000
Well, sorry, I got antsy.

04:22.044 --> 04:23.567
Okay, well...

04:23.611 --> 04:24.742
can you wait somewhere else?

04:24.786 --> 04:26.222
I mean, what's the point
of alone time

04:26.266 --> 04:28.572
if we're not, you know, alone

04:28.616 --> 04:29.530
Oh, hey.

04:30.922 --> 04:32.402
I forgot my schedule.
What

04:32.446 --> 04:33.969
Oh, my God.

04:34.012 --> 04:35.579
You said you didn't want to be
on the list,

04:35.623 --> 04:38.495
that working deep undercover
made it easy for you

04:38.539 --> 04:40.454
to process the loss
of coworkers.

04:40.497 --> 04:43.326
Yeah, because we're all
just cogs in a machine.

04:43.370 --> 04:45.415
I was, uh, wrong about this one.

04:47.678 --> 04:49.376
Abby's not a cog.

04:49.419 --> 04:50.638
She's like a unicorn.

04:50.681 --> 04:51.987
She's like a goth unicorn.

04:52.030 --> 04:53.815
McGEE:
It's been a week.

04:53.858 --> 04:55.425
Why is it still so hard?

04:55.469 --> 04:58.036
Because they were your family.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.648
Abby.

05:00.691 --> 05:02.606
Yeah. And Reeves.

05:02.650 --> 05:05.783
Well, I see the alone-time
schedule I set up for you

05:05.827 --> 05:09.787
has naturally transitioned
to a group discussion.

05:09.831 --> 05:12.616
Next maybe you're ready to sit
down one-on-one and, uh,

05:12.660 --> 05:14.052
Nah, I'm cool.really get to the root

05:14.096 --> 05:16.228
of your emotional...I'm really cool.

05:16.272 --> 05:18.100
We're fine. Thanks.

05:19.449 --> 05:20.798
Okay.

05:20.842 --> 05:22.670
PHIL:
I was out sailingMarcy.

05:22.713 --> 05:24.889
The weather was getting bad
so I was about to head in

05:24.933 --> 05:26.848
when this motorboat
comes out of nowhere.

05:26.891 --> 05:28.893
The next thing I know,
bam, bam, bam!

05:28.937 --> 05:30.721
I realize I'm taking
fire, baby.

05:30.765 --> 05:32.897
This crazy bastard's
trying to kill me.

05:32.941 --> 05:34.812
I got no choice but
to hop into the drink.

05:34.856 --> 05:37.598
The motorboat rams Marcy
and leaves me for dead.

05:37.641 --> 05:40.644
She took on water and,
uh, capsized in the wave.

05:40.688 --> 05:44.518
Must've happened around
37 degrees north

05:44.561 --> 05:46.911
because I was able to
make it to Tom's Cove.

05:46.955 --> 05:49.349
Good thing I keep my
swimming quals current.

05:49.392 --> 05:51.525
It didn't hurt that the
tide was in my favor.

05:51.568 --> 05:54.266
You want to, you
want to chime in?

05:54.310 --> 05:57.357
No. Still waiting.For?

05:57.400 --> 05:59.750
The reason you are down here.

05:59.794 --> 06:01.143
I just told you--
somebody wants me dead.

06:01.186 --> 06:03.058
Who?
I don't know.
That's why you're here.

06:03.101 --> 06:05.539
No, it's not, Phil.
It's not.

06:05.582 --> 06:07.018
I am here for your memorial.

06:07.062 --> 06:09.151
What? It's only been a few days.

06:09.194 --> 06:10.674
Six!

06:10.718 --> 06:12.633
It's been six days, Phil.

06:12.676 --> 06:14.765
The Coast Guard called off
their search.

06:14.809 --> 06:16.376
Oh, my God.

06:16.419 --> 06:17.681
Must've lost track of time.

06:17.725 --> 06:19.291
How the hell did that happen?

06:19.335 --> 06:21.424
Well, I got a pretty good idea.

06:23.470 --> 06:24.732
Why didn't you just call me?

06:24.775 --> 06:27.038
I did. As soon as I made it
back to shore,

06:27.082 --> 06:29.563
I called NCIS and left a message
with one of your agents.

06:29.606 --> 06:31.086
What agent?I don't know.

06:31.129 --> 06:32.000
Some British guy.

06:32.043 --> 06:34.481
Reeves.

06:34.524 --> 06:36.657
Yeah. That's him.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.223
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

06:38.267 --> 06:39.964
Listen, the only reason
I kept Marcy in the dark

06:40.008 --> 06:41.444
was to protect her.

06:41.488 --> 06:42.750
You know,
if somebody is after me,

06:42.793 --> 06:44.795
I don't want her
to become collateral damage.

06:44.839 --> 06:46.449
Hell, she could've been
on the boat with me.

06:46.493 --> 06:48.712
You got to tell her.

06:50.540 --> 06:52.455
Phil.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.763
It might sound crazy,

06:55.806 --> 06:58.592
but this could actually
work in our favor.

06:58.635 --> 07:00.898
Right now,
the bad guys

07:00.942 --> 07:03.205
think they got away with murder.

07:03.248 --> 07:04.685
We have a tactical advantage
here.

07:04.728 --> 07:05.947
A tactical advantage?

07:05.990 --> 07:07.427
Yeah. They don't know
we're hunting them.

07:07.470 --> 07:09.603
"We're"?
"We're hunting them"?

07:09.646 --> 07:10.995
Got to help me,
Gibbs. Please.

07:11.039 --> 07:13.128
For a friend.

07:21.005 --> 07:23.225
I knew you helped Captain Brooks
build his boat.

07:23.268 --> 07:24.966
I didn't know that you were
willing to lie for him.

07:25.009 --> 07:27.098
I'm just trying
to be honest with you, Leon.

07:27.142 --> 07:29.100
Well, your honesty puts me
in a tough spot, Gibbs.

07:29.144 --> 07:32.626
A naval officer everyone thinks
is dead is actually alive

07:32.669 --> 07:34.236
and you agreed
to go along with it.

07:34.279 --> 07:35.977
Until we find out
who tried to kill him, yeah.

07:36.020 --> 07:37.979
And the captain thinks
that this is an advantage?

07:38.022 --> 07:39.763
So do I.Tell that to his wife.

07:39.807 --> 07:42.723
We will, eventually.More time that passes,

07:42.766 --> 07:43.898
the harder that's gonna be
to explain.

07:43.941 --> 07:45.900
Well, it's a good
thing we work fast.

07:45.943 --> 07:48.468
Without the aid of a full-time
forensic scientist?

07:48.511 --> 07:50.426
That's easier said than done.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.472
The team needs to move forward.

07:52.515 --> 07:55.083
Yeah. I know.

07:55.126 --> 07:57.520
And I'm interviewing candidates
to try to fill the vacancy

07:57.564 --> 07:59.653
left by Ms. Sciuto,
which, as you know,

07:59.696 --> 08:01.481
is no easy task.

08:01.524 --> 08:03.221
I mean, this could be
a lengthy process.

08:03.265 --> 08:04.527
Cases don't wait.

08:04.571 --> 08:06.486
I'm open to finding
a temporary solution.

08:07.530 --> 08:09.619
Good.

08:09.663 --> 08:11.839
You already made arrangements.

08:11.882 --> 08:13.493
When were you gonna tell me?

08:18.193 --> 08:19.499
McGEE:
Captain Phillip Brooks.

08:19.542 --> 08:21.022
Married, no kids.

08:21.065 --> 08:23.459
Works in the Navy Office
of Financial Operations.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.895
So he's a glorified
accountant.

08:24.939 --> 08:27.376
McGEE:
The Navy salary
funds his boat hobby.

08:27.419 --> 08:29.030
He also dabbles
in real estate.

08:29.073 --> 08:31.075
Owns some commercial property
in the area.

08:31.119 --> 08:33.077
Leases them out.TORRES: It wouldn't
be the first time

08:33.121 --> 08:35.166
someone wants to
kill their landlord.You have proof

08:35.210 --> 08:36.298
or are you speaking
from personal experience?

08:36.341 --> 08:37.560
Personal experience.

08:37.604 --> 08:39.301
Ooh.

08:39.344 --> 08:41.521
Criminal record
is clean, too.

08:41.564 --> 08:43.435
McGEE:
Yeah, so is
his military record.

08:43.479 --> 08:45.568
Only disciplinary action
was for mentioning the Navy

08:45.612 --> 08:47.962
in a series of political
tweets last year.

08:48.005 --> 08:49.572
Oh, he's one of those crazies.

08:49.616 --> 08:51.574
McGEE: No, he was calling for
higher pay for public educators.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.794
His wife Marcy's
a third-grade teacher.

08:53.837 --> 08:56.623
Am I the only one surprised that
Gibbs has a friend who tweets?

08:56.666 --> 08:58.189
You've got
to be kidding me.

08:58.233 --> 09:00.496
I know, right? Like no way the
love of boats runs that deep.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.584
But no, that's not what I mean.

09:01.628 --> 09:03.368
Reeves's phone system
has been erased.

09:03.412 --> 09:05.545
His desk has been
completely cleared out.

09:05.588 --> 09:08.722
I mean, they-they even got rid
of his flavored crisps.

09:08.765 --> 09:11.463
Who's "they"?It had to be MI6
'cause other than you,

09:11.507 --> 09:14.031
no other Americans
actually eat those things.

09:14.075 --> 09:15.467
Wait, so we have no way
to verify

09:15.511 --> 09:17.078
that the captain
actually called Gibbs?

09:17.121 --> 09:19.428
No. It's-it's-it's like Clay
was never even here.

09:19.471 --> 09:21.038
I'm gonna call MI6.

09:21.082 --> 09:22.300
Check with the Coast Guard
first.

09:22.344 --> 09:24.999
I want everything they found
on Phil's boat.

09:25.042 --> 09:27.871
Um, well, their agents
already processed

09:27.915 --> 09:29.177
the little that was left

09:29.220 --> 09:31.048
after the wreckage.

09:31.092 --> 09:33.703
But, um, we can
take another look.

09:33.747 --> 09:35.009
Really

09:35.052 --> 09:36.619
We don't have
a forensic scientist.

09:36.663 --> 09:37.620
It's not the first time.

09:37.664 --> 09:39.013
Well, all due respect, boss,

09:39.056 --> 09:41.232
I know we've filled in
for Abby before,

09:41.276 --> 09:42.756
but this time I think
it's a little different.

09:42.799 --> 09:44.105
Yes, I agree with you, McGee.

09:44.148 --> 09:46.673
So we aren't working
in the lab?

09:46.716 --> 09:48.500
Good afternoon, Jethro.

09:48.544 --> 09:49.893
Duck. Kasie.

09:49.937 --> 09:51.503
Gibbs. Hey, guys.

09:54.463 --> 09:56.770
Well, this isn't
awkward at all.

09:56.813 --> 09:57.988
Thanks for helping out.KASIE: Yeah.

09:58.032 --> 09:59.642
Hey, Gibbs, uh,

09:59.686 --> 10:01.122
I was wondering if we
could maybe talk...?

10:01.165 --> 10:03.037
McGee, Bishop. Coast
Guard. Torres, come on.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.300
You're with me.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.784
Or I could just
jump right in.

10:12.568 --> 10:14.875
My wife liked
the open-concept kitchen.

10:14.918 --> 10:16.528
I liked the hidden bomb shelter.

10:16.572 --> 10:18.269
Didn't think it'd actually
be useful, though.

10:18.313 --> 10:20.228
Yeah, especially
in this century.

10:20.271 --> 10:21.708
Don't you watch the news?

10:21.751 --> 10:23.666
Mutually assured destruction
is back in vogue.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.755
How about some Krispy Kreme
next time?

10:25.799 --> 10:28.497
Not gonna be a next time.You moving me?

10:28.540 --> 10:29.890
Yes, and we don't have
much time.

10:29.933 --> 10:31.152
Your wife is out meeting
with the grief counselor.

10:31.195 --> 10:33.763
Where am I going?My couch.

10:33.807 --> 10:35.112
Grabbed a few file
boxes from upstairs.

10:35.156 --> 10:37.549
Might help with the case.Did you get my laptop?

10:37.593 --> 10:39.682
Most victims have had previous
contact with their attacker.

10:39.726 --> 10:42.337
Thank you, Detective.

10:42.380 --> 10:43.686
Mm.

10:43.730 --> 10:44.644
MARCY :
Jethro?!

10:44.687 --> 10:46.254
I'm back!

10:46.297 --> 10:48.256
Yeah! Be right up!

10:48.299 --> 10:50.650
Are you still going through
tools down there?!

10:50.693 --> 10:51.868
Oh, boy.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.353
Mrs. Brooks.

10:58.396 --> 10:59.702
How you doing?

10:59.746 --> 11:01.356
Special Agent Nick Torres.

11:01.399 --> 11:02.966
Hi.

11:03.010 --> 11:05.490
Hey.

11:05.534 --> 11:06.927
Can I give you
a hand with those?

11:06.970 --> 11:09.930
I see Gibbs called
for reinforcements.

11:09.973 --> 11:12.672
Guess he wanted more tools
than he thought.

11:12.715 --> 11:13.716
I guess so.

11:13.760 --> 11:16.588
You know, you don't
need to do this.

11:16.632 --> 11:18.416
Oh, it's no problem.

11:20.070 --> 11:24.074
Um, Mrs. Brooks, if I may.

11:24.118 --> 11:29.210
I can't even imagine what
you must be going through.

11:29.253 --> 11:32.474
Thanks.

11:32.517 --> 11:34.955
I think, mainly,
because it's so sudden.

11:34.998 --> 11:36.696
You know, with an illness,

11:36.739 --> 11:39.307
you have time
to process it,

11:39.350 --> 11:40.700
or say good-bye.

11:40.743 --> 11:42.702
But, uh, but this,

11:42.745 --> 11:45.705
Mm-hmm.it's like one day,

11:45.748 --> 11:48.969
someone you love is here, and
the next day, they're gone.

11:49.012 --> 11:51.536
I understand.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.408
Believe me.

11:53.451 --> 11:55.540
KASIE:
Okay.

11:55.584 --> 11:57.151
We are a go for gloves.

11:57.194 --> 11:59.588
Goggles, we are a go.

11:59.631 --> 12:02.112
Fingerprint dust, ooh.

12:02.156 --> 12:03.418
Oh, that's a go.

12:03.461 --> 12:05.768
What are you doing?I'm nervous.

12:05.812 --> 12:08.771
The first solo flight, so I
don't want to mess up anything.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.904
Hence, the prelaunch checklist.

12:10.947 --> 12:13.080
"Prelaunch"? This isn't NASA.

12:13.123 --> 12:15.212
Oh, well, Abby said
I should do things my way,

12:15.256 --> 12:16.779
and my way is the way of NASA.

12:16.823 --> 12:19.651
Well-planned, well-executed,
with the dare to dream.

12:20.957 --> 12:22.916
I went to space camp
when I was a kid.

12:22.959 --> 12:23.873
Really? I did, too.Oh.

12:23.917 --> 12:25.440
Um, yeah.

12:25.483 --> 12:26.789
Well, Mom couldn't afford
real space camp,

12:26.833 --> 12:28.791
so we watched
the Hale-Bopp comet

12:28.835 --> 12:32.142
from my uncle's Monte Carlo in
the back of a Sears parking lot.

12:32.186 --> 12:33.665
Oh.

12:33.709 --> 12:35.798
Wait, wh...
you said you talked to Abby.

12:35.842 --> 12:37.669
Oh, of course.
Dream job or not,

12:37.713 --> 12:39.584
I wouldn't come here
without her blessing.

12:39.628 --> 12:40.803
I'm not crazy.

12:40.847 --> 12:41.891
Could've fooled me.

12:41.935 --> 12:44.024
That was my supervisor.

12:44.067 --> 12:45.765
She has the same
question I do.

12:45.808 --> 12:46.940
Why am I delivering evidence

12:46.983 --> 12:48.811
that the Coast Guard
already processed?

12:48.855 --> 12:50.813
We're just being thorough.

12:50.857 --> 12:53.860
Thorough, or is there something
new that I should be aware of?

12:53.903 --> 12:55.078
No.No, not at all.

12:55.122 --> 12:56.471
Oh, no, no.

12:57.733 --> 12:58.952
AGENT:
Right.

12:58.995 --> 13:00.910
That was totally believable.

13:00.954 --> 13:01.998
KASIE:
Uh...

13:02.042 --> 13:03.826
I'm gonna get to work.

13:03.870 --> 13:06.829
Oh.

13:06.873 --> 13:09.527
Listen, our boss
has a hunch.

13:09.571 --> 13:11.007
What kind of hunch?

13:11.051 --> 13:12.922
The kind that needs
further investigation.

13:12.966 --> 13:16.099
NCIS keeps digging, so do I.

13:16.143 --> 13:18.754
I trust you'll notify me at
the Coast Guard if you find...

13:18.798 --> 13:19.929
something.

13:19.973 --> 13:21.931
Absolutely. You, the same.

13:27.937 --> 13:30.505
Uh, Agent McGee?

13:30.548 --> 13:31.680
Yeah

13:31.723 --> 13:33.682
:
Something.

13:33.725 --> 13:35.162
TORRES:
I don't get it.

13:35.205 --> 13:37.338
It just looks like
damage from the wreck.

13:37.381 --> 13:39.340
Yeah, that's what
the Coast Guard thought.

13:39.383 --> 13:41.995
But they didn't hear
Phil's story.

13:42.038 --> 13:43.997
Kasie tested the
gouge in the wood,

13:44.040 --> 13:46.042
found traces
of cupronickel.

13:46.086 --> 13:47.522
It's a bullet.Slug,

13:47.565 --> 13:49.524
grazed the side
of the sailboat mast.

13:49.567 --> 13:51.961
Coast Guard missed it,
but our forensic astronaut

13:52.005 --> 13:53.267
certainly did not.

13:53.310 --> 13:54.572
Astronaut?

13:54.616 --> 13:55.573
You'll see.

13:55.617 --> 13:56.618
It doesn't give us a shooter.

13:56.661 --> 13:58.402
Well, it does
confirm Phil's story.

13:58.446 --> 14:00.796
I didn't know
that was in question.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.276
BISHOP:
Uh, maybe it should be.

14:02.319 --> 14:06.454
Been scrubbing
the captain's laptop,

14:06.497 --> 14:09.152
and found some pretty
questionable photos.

14:09.196 --> 14:10.893
What is "questionable"?

14:10.937 --> 14:13.461
Put it up.Yeah, Gibbs, I don't know
if you want to see this.

14:13.504 --> 14:14.854
Bishop, do it.

14:14.897 --> 14:16.681
Okay.

14:20.033 --> 14:20.860
Ooh, that is questionable.

14:20.903 --> 14:21.991
It's definitely the captain.

14:24.515 --> 14:25.473
And that ain't Marcy.

14:25.516 --> 14:27.518
McGEE:
Who is she?

14:30.565 --> 14:32.567
She's motive.

14:46.102 --> 14:48.148
Gibbs! Thank God you're home.

14:48.191 --> 14:50.193
Going stir-crazy here.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.457
Got an update for me?

15:00.987 --> 15:04.381
Guess the, uh, pasta puttanesca
will have to wait.

15:04.425 --> 15:05.426
Um...

15:08.385 --> 15:10.474
I know how this looks.
Bad.

15:10.518 --> 15:12.476
These photos are fake.
I got nothing to hide,

15:12.520 --> 15:14.261
and if you don't believe me,
ask Marcy.

15:14.304 --> 15:15.349
She knows about this?I showed them to her.

15:15.392 --> 15:16.567
If she found them on her own,

15:16.611 --> 15:18.613
it would look like
I was hiding something.

15:18.656 --> 15:19.570
It still does.

15:19.614 --> 15:20.528
Who do you think I am, Gibbs?

15:20.571 --> 15:22.530
She's half my age.

15:22.573 --> 15:24.967
I received these photos
from an anonymous e-mail account

15:25.011 --> 15:26.882
demanding 250 grand.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.797
Lot of money, Phil.Which is why I went
to the police.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.103
They said it was just
an Internet scam,

15:30.146 --> 15:31.452
and if these photos
are really fake,

15:31.495 --> 15:33.584
I should go to my wife,
tell her the truth

15:33.628 --> 15:35.151
and move on. I did.

15:35.195 --> 15:37.501
And you didn't think
that was worth mentioning?

15:37.545 --> 15:38.894
It was a year ago.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.114
I didn't think it could be
connected to my murder.

15:41.157 --> 15:42.637
And if somebody wants me
to transfer money,

15:42.680 --> 15:44.160
they need me alive.

15:44.204 --> 15:46.510
No, no, no, these two
are completely unrelated.

15:46.554 --> 15:47.772
I'll decide that.I'm just telling you,

15:47.816 --> 15:49.687
I have no idea where
these pictures are from.

15:52.212 --> 15:54.214
You have never seen this woman?

15:56.956 --> 15:59.741
Well, I didn't say that.

16:01.351 --> 16:03.658
So according to Captain Brooks,
he and the woman

16:03.701 --> 16:06.704
in this picture didn't have
an affair, but are friends?

16:06.748 --> 16:08.489
He told Gibbs
"close friends."

16:08.532 --> 16:10.056
Yeah, okay.
That can happen.

16:10.099 --> 16:11.579
Can it?

16:11.622 --> 16:14.060
Sure. I mean, you and Abby were
close friends for years,

16:14.103 --> 16:16.758
and it's not like the two of you
ever hooked up.

16:18.673 --> 16:20.675
Oh.

16:22.459 --> 16:23.721
Oh.

16:23.765 --> 16:26.724
Uh... let's-let's table that.

16:26.768 --> 16:29.640
Um, so I was able to confirm

16:29.684 --> 16:31.033
what the captain
is saying is true,

16:31.077 --> 16:32.730
a-about the pictures, at least.

16:32.774 --> 16:33.818
They're fake.

16:33.862 --> 16:35.646
Wow. That was fast.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.866
Oh, well, I was in here
working for, like,

16:37.909 --> 16:39.346
three hours before you got here.

16:39.389 --> 16:41.826
That's the job, no?
Yeah.

16:41.870 --> 16:44.307
Yeah, no, I'm just, uh,
saying I'm used to Abby

16:44.351 --> 16:46.744
sort of winding up
to the big reveal.

16:46.788 --> 16:48.746
Oh. Oh!

16:48.790 --> 16:50.226
I skipped a step.

16:50.270 --> 16:51.358
The most fun step.

16:51.401 --> 16:53.316
Okay, uh, let's rewind the tape.

16:56.885 --> 16:58.930
Even the best digital artists
leave breadcrumbs

16:58.974 --> 17:01.020
that show an image
has been altered.

17:01.063 --> 17:02.630
McGEE:
That looks pretty good.

17:02.673 --> 17:04.980
Yeah, I thought so, too,
until I realized

17:05.024 --> 17:07.461
that this picture
must've been taken on Tatooine.

17:07.504 --> 17:09.028
The planet in Star Wars?

17:09.071 --> 17:10.812
Yeah, the-the one
with two suns.

17:10.855 --> 17:13.380
Uh, take a look at the light
in this image.

17:13.423 --> 17:14.555
McGEE: Sun's coming
from two different places.

17:14.598 --> 17:15.991
KASIE:
Mm-hmm.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.949
And there are other subtle
but similar faults

17:17.993 --> 17:19.429
throughout the image.

17:19.473 --> 17:22.345
Rough edges, uh,
mismatched grain patterns,

17:22.389 --> 17:24.130
inconsistent metadata.

17:24.173 --> 17:25.566
Huh.

17:25.609 --> 17:27.133
Although they did
a really nice job

17:27.176 --> 17:29.396
with our mystery woman's
skin tone.

17:29.439 --> 17:31.485
Yeah, her name is
Antonia Morello.

17:31.528 --> 17:33.661
Phil said she leases
one of the stores

17:33.704 --> 17:35.010
in a strip mall that he owns.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.012
Oh, what'd she say
about these photos?

17:37.056 --> 17:38.796
Oh, nothing yet.
Haven't talked to her.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.624
All right, thanks.

17:40.668 --> 17:42.670
It's good work, Abbs.

17:46.195 --> 17:48.763
I'm sorry, it's force of habit.

17:48.806 --> 17:50.765
I've said the same thing
for 15 years.

17:50.808 --> 17:52.680
Don't apologize, be proud.

17:52.723 --> 17:55.770
I can't wait to be somewhere,
doing something for that long.

17:55.813 --> 17:57.685
It means you love
your job, right?

17:58.947 --> 18:00.949
Right.

18:02.994 --> 18:04.518
Hmm.

18:16.051 --> 18:18.358
Can I help you?

18:19.663 --> 18:22.188
It's like Clay
was never here.

18:22.231 --> 18:23.319
Mm!

18:23.363 --> 18:24.799
I know it feels that way.

18:24.842 --> 18:27.106
Ah, screw MI6
and their secret crap.

18:27.149 --> 18:29.020
They can't just, like,
erase a person.

18:29.064 --> 18:31.153
That's right,
you can't.

18:32.589 --> 18:33.808
I won't let them.

18:34.852 --> 18:36.289
Okay.

18:36.332 --> 18:37.551
Listen.

18:37.594 --> 18:38.856
Don't dart angry.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.728
I'm sorry about your wall.

18:40.771 --> 18:42.730
Don't be.
I've never been a big fan

18:42.773 --> 18:45.036
of Cheeto-dusted orange, anyway.

18:46.777 --> 18:48.779
I really thought

18:48.823 --> 18:50.912
I was past the anger stage.

18:52.261 --> 18:54.220
And then, this whole desk thing

18:54.263 --> 18:55.873
made me realize something else.

18:55.917 --> 18:56.744
What's that?

18:58.354 --> 19:00.530
That we don't even have
a picture together.

19:00.574 --> 19:03.403
But Reeves was always snapping
photos with his phone.

19:03.446 --> 19:06.928
I know. Hisphone.

19:06.971 --> 19:11.237
Everything from our trip to
Scotland together two years ago

19:11.280 --> 19:14.718
to the coffee shop last week.

19:14.762 --> 19:17.721
And I... I never asked him
to send me any.

19:17.765 --> 19:19.723
So MI6 took his cell, too, huh?

19:19.767 --> 19:21.421
Yeah.

19:21.464 --> 19:24.206
Clay was only here
as a liaison officer,

19:24.250 --> 19:28.906
which means that he wasn't
officially a part of NCIS.

19:28.950 --> 19:31.170
"Officially."

19:31.213 --> 19:33.041
But we know the truth.

19:33.084 --> 19:34.825
He died a hero.

19:34.869 --> 19:39.743
A hero whose picture won't even
be on our memorial wall.

19:46.359 --> 19:49.797
Phil said these places been
vacant for a long time.

19:49.840 --> 19:53.453
Yeah. Could use a
new coat of paint.

19:53.496 --> 19:55.150
And a new phone number.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.718
That area code was
reassigned three years ago.

19:57.761 --> 19:59.502
You know, I don't
think this place

19:59.546 --> 20:01.983
is paying for the
lacquer on Phil's boat.

20:02.026 --> 20:03.114
It's a boat, McGee.

20:03.158 --> 20:05.378
Spar varnish.

20:06.596 --> 20:08.119
Hey, suits!

20:08.163 --> 20:10.252
I told you, I saw you
nosing around here again,

20:10.296 --> 20:11.384
there'd be hell to pay.

20:11.427 --> 20:13.647
Well, here comes hell.

20:17.564 --> 20:21.785
What do you have to
say about that, huh?

20:21.829 --> 20:23.134
Federal agents.

20:24.397 --> 20:26.529
Oh, damn.

20:28.357 --> 20:29.445
Coffee?

20:30.925 --> 20:33.536
ANTONIA:
There you go, Agent Gibbs.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.930
Sure I can't get you anything,
Agent McGee?

20:35.973 --> 20:38.193
Uh, no, thanks.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.586
You restore all these?

20:39.629 --> 20:40.978
Oh, some are my dad.

20:41.022 --> 20:43.372
Kind of inherited the
place when he passed.

20:43.416 --> 20:45.548
Ah, they're beautiful.Thanks.

20:45.592 --> 20:47.811
Eh, it doesn't
make me rich, but...

20:47.855 --> 20:50.466
there's a reason old machines
like this live on.
