WEBVTT

00:16.917 --> 00:18.917
DO YOU NEED
ANYTHING ELSE, SIR?

00:18.917 --> 00:20.875
MORE BREAD, PERHAPS?

00:20.875 --> 00:22.875
NOT BREAD, BUT I WILL TAKE
ANOTHER ONE OF THESE.

00:22.875 --> 00:24.041
AND YOU DON'T
HAVE TO CALL ME SIR.

00:24.041 --> 00:25.458
IT KIND OF CREEPS ME OUT.

00:25.458 --> 00:26.500
YES, SIR.

00:26.500 --> 00:27.834
SORRY.

00:27.834 --> 00:30.291
I'LL BE LEAVING NOW.

00:34.834 --> 00:37.375
HELLO.
DID YOU MISS ME?

00:37.375 --> 00:39.166
I DID,

00:39.166 --> 00:39.834
BUT THE WAITRESS WAS
TOTALLY FLIRTING WITH ME,

00:39.834 --> 00:41.792
SO IT WAS ALL RIGHT.

00:41.792 --> 00:44.291
OOH, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE FUN.

00:44.291 --> 00:45.917
IT WAS, BUT SHE'S
NOT REALLY MY TYPE.

00:45.917 --> 00:46.708
GOOD.

00:46.708 --> 00:49.708
WHAT IS YOUR TYPE,
EXACTLY?

00:49.708 --> 00:53.542
GENERALLY I TEND TO PREFER
THE BRAINY BRUNETTES
WITH BROWN EYES.

00:53.542 --> 00:55.959
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

00:55.959 --> 00:57.250
FEEL FREE.

00:57.250 --> 01:01.375
WHY DID YOU WAIT SO LONG
TO ASK ME OUT?

01:01.375 --> 01:05.417
WELL, FOR A WHILE THERE
I WAS OTHERWISE ENGAGED,

01:05.417 --> 01:07.291
BUT I'VE TAKEN CARE
OF THAT NOW, I PROMISE.

01:07.291 --> 01:08.959
THANK YOU.

01:08.959 --> 01:12.542
SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO,

01:12.542 --> 01:13.500
I'D LIKE TO PROPOSE
A TOAST IF I MAY.

01:13.500 --> 01:16.250
YOU MAY.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.875
TO GETTING TO KNOW
EACH OTHER BETTER.

01:17.875 --> 01:20.708
MUCH  BETTER.

02:17.041 --> 02:19.417
WELL, JOEY, THAT'S NOT
THE OVERRIDING MESSAGE.

02:19.417 --> 02:20.291
YES, IT IS.

02:20.291 --> 02:23.125
ULTIMATELY,
YOSSARIAN MUST ACCEPT

02:23.125 --> 02:24.583
THAT HE'S TRAPPED
IN AN INSANE WORLD.

02:24.583 --> 02:27.000
NO, BUT HE ESCAPES IN THE END,
SO THERE'S HOPE.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.208
HOPE FOR WHAT?

02:28.208 --> 02:29.917
WELL, THE BEAUTY IS
WE DON'T KNOW,

02:29.917 --> 02:31.792
BUT HIS ESCAPE IS
A TESTAMENT TO THE POWER

02:31.792 --> 02:33.708
OF ONE MAN'S STRUGGLE
AGAINST THE SYSTEM.

02:33.708 --> 02:36.166
HETSON'S INTERPRETATION
IS MUCH BLEAKER.

02:36.166 --> 02:38.375
WHY DOES THAT
NOT SURPRISE ME?

02:38.375 --> 02:40.125
YOU KNOW,
IF ALL YOU'RE GONNA DO
ON THIS FINAL EXAM

02:40.125 --> 02:42.792
IS JUST REGURGITATE EVERYTHING
HETSON SAID IN CLASS,

02:42.792 --> 02:45.125
YOU'RE NOT REALLY DEVELOPING
A MIND OF YOUR OWN.

02:45.125 --> 02:47.291
I'LL DEVELOP
A MIND OF MY OWN LATER.

02:47.291 --> 02:49.000
RIGHT NOW
I HAVE TO ACE THIS FINAL.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.291
YOU REMEMBER
A CERTAIN INCIDENT
THAT HAPPENED

02:50.291 --> 02:52.333
THE LAST TIME
I TOOK A FINAL
FOR THIS MAN?

02:54.542 --> 02:56.417
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.

02:56.417 --> 02:57.500
WHAT'S WRONG?

02:57.500 --> 03:00.250
GOD IS PUNISHING ME.

03:00.250 --> 03:02.166
HERE. READ THIS.

03:04.166 --> 03:06.834
AFTER MY LONG
AND PROTRACTED BATTLE

03:06.834 --> 03:08.125
WITH A SERIOUS
SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEM,

03:08.125 --> 03:11.250
THE HEARTLESS ADMINISTRATION
OF THIS ESTEEMED UNIVERSITY

03:11.250 --> 03:12.917
IS GONNA KICK ME OUT!

03:12.917 --> 03:14.583
THAT SEEMS PRETTY HARSH.

03:14.583 --> 03:17.333
AUDREY, THIS IS
JUST A LETTER FROM THE DEAN

03:17.333 --> 03:19.917
SAYING IF YOU SIGN UP
FOR SUMMER SCHOOL
YOU CAN STAY.

03:19.917 --> 03:21.792
THE DEAN CAN
BITE ME, JO.

03:21.792 --> 03:24.834
YOU MISSED ALMOST
AN ENTIRE SEMESTER.

03:24.834 --> 03:26.125
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

03:26.125 --> 03:28.250
I'M GONNA BE, LIKE,
ALONE HERE IN THIS BOX
ALL SUMMER.

03:28.250 --> 03:31.125
YOU LEAVE IN 2 DAYS,
RIGHT?

03:31.125 --> 03:32.542
NOT BY CHOICE, BUT YEAH.

03:34.375 --> 03:36.208
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

03:36.208 --> 03:37.583
TO NEGOTIATE.

03:37.583 --> 03:39.125
I DON'T THINK
THIS IS NEGOTIABLE.

03:39.125 --> 03:41.208
EVERYTHING IS NEGOTIABLE.

03:44.875 --> 03:48.542
REMIND ME AGAIN.
YOU ARE FRIENDS WITH HER
BECAUSE...

03:48.542 --> 03:51.792
SHE SAVED MY LIFE ONCE
IN A BAR IN CALCUTTA.

03:51.792 --> 03:53.000
RIGHT.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.291
WHICH BRINGS UP
AN EXCELLENT POINT,
EDDIE.

03:55.291 --> 03:57.417
WE'RE GETTING KICKED
OUT OF OUR LITTLE
LOVE NEST

03:57.417 --> 03:58.542
BY WEEK'S END.

03:58.542 --> 04:00.417
AT WHICH POINT
WE'RE GONNA MOVE INTO MY CAR,

04:00.417 --> 04:02.500
WHICH I'VE GOT PARKED
DOWN BY THE RIVER.

04:02.500 --> 04:05.041
THAT IS NOT THE PLAN.

04:05.041 --> 04:06.708
THAT'S MY PLAN.
OH, YEAH?

04:06.708 --> 04:10.083
I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA
GET JOBS IN THE CAPE
THIS SUMMER,

04:10.083 --> 04:11.750
AND LIVE AT MY SISTER'S
AND SAVE MONEY.

04:11.750 --> 04:14.041
RIGHT, AND ENDURE
WEEKLY INTERROGATIONS
FROM YOUR FATHER

04:14.041 --> 04:16.083
ABOUT THE LACK OF PROSPECTS
FOR MY FUTURE.

04:16.083 --> 04:17.541
YOU'RE STARTING SCHOOL
IN THE FALL

04:17.541 --> 04:20.083
AT ONE OF THE MOST
PRESTIGIOUS WRITING PROGRAMS
IN THE COUNTRY.

04:20.083 --> 04:22.417
YES, YES, I KNOW.
IN CALIFORNIA.

04:22.417 --> 04:25.875
AND IF WE'RE GONNA BE
RIPPED APART BY GEOGRAPHY
IN 3 SHORT MONTHS,

04:25.875 --> 04:28.667
I'M NOT GONNA SPEND THAT TIME
BUSSING TABLES.

04:28.667 --> 04:31.250
I'VE GOT SOME BIGGER PLANS
IN MIND.

04:31.250 --> 04:33.166
AND WHAT DO THESE
BIGGER PLANS ENTAIL?

04:33.166 --> 04:35.583
OH, NO. NO, RIGHT NOW
YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON ONE THING,

04:35.583 --> 04:39.458
AND ONE THING ONLY.
AND AFTER THE EXAM, JO,

04:39.458 --> 04:40.500
ALL WILL BE REVEALED.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.625
WELL, AND WHAT IF
I CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG?

04:42.625 --> 04:45.750
I THINK YOU CAN.

04:45.750 --> 04:49.250
MAYBE I'LL JUST HAVE
TO USE MY FEMININE WILES

04:49.250 --> 04:50.250
TO PRY IT OUT OF YOU.

04:50.250 --> 04:52.333
MY LIPS ARE SEALED, JO.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.708
UH-HUH.

04:57.583 --> 05:00.542
NICE TRY.

05:00.542 --> 05:00.625
YOU OFFICIALLY SUCK.

05:08.291 --> 05:11.375
YEAH, YEAH, YOU KNOW,
I'M PRETTY SURE

05:11.375 --> 05:13.083
YOU DON'T WANT TO MIX
MOUNTAIN DEW WITH NODOZ.

05:13.083 --> 05:17.291
WHY? BECAUSE
THEY BOTH CONTAIN
A LOT OF CAFFEINE, AND--

05:17.291 --> 05:19.792
YEAH, YEAH, THAT
QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE
ALBUM DOES REALLY ROCK.

05:19.792 --> 05:21.834
IT'S ONE--

05:24.959 --> 05:28.083
UM, FIRST THING
YOU NEED TO DO IS
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

05:28.083 --> 05:31.083
GOOD. NOW, FIND SOMEBODY
IN YOUR CLASS,

05:31.083 --> 05:32.417
BORROW THEIR NOTES,
AND--

05:32.417 --> 05:34.500
OK, YES, YES.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.333
WE'RE HERE 24/7.
YOU CAN CALL BACK
ANYTIME. OK?

05:37.333 --> 05:39.750
ALL RIGHT. GOOD LUCK.

05:39.750 --> 05:40.834
ROUGH DAY?

05:40.834 --> 05:43.041
YEAH, EXAMS BRING OUT
THE WORST IN PEOPLE.

05:43.041 --> 05:44.708
THE IMPORTANT THING IS
YOU TALKED HIM DOWN

05:44.708 --> 05:47.166
FROM MOUNTAIN DEW
AND NODOZ.

05:47.166 --> 05:47.583
THAT CAN BE
A DEADLY COMBINATION.

05:50.250 --> 05:52.708
YEAH, I'VE DONE
A REAL SERVICE
TO HUMANITY.

05:52.708 --> 05:53.875
DID YOU NEED SOMETHING?

05:53.875 --> 05:58.000
SO THIS WHOLE MAD THING
HASN'T WORN OFF YET, HUH?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.875
SPEAK QUICKLY, JACK.

06:00.875 --> 06:03.500
THE PHONE
COULD RING AGAIN
AT ANY SECOND,

06:03.500 --> 06:05.417
AND THE PROBLEMS OF
A FECKLESS EX-BOYFRIEND
AREN'T MUCH

06:05.417 --> 06:08.250
COMPARED WITH
THE SUICIDAL ANGUISH
OF GRADUATING SENIORS.

06:08.250 --> 06:09.875
CAN WE JUST STOP THIS, PLEASE?

06:09.875 --> 06:11.083
CAN WE JUST TALK?

06:11.083 --> 06:12.708
AT LEAST GIVE ME
THE SAME CHANCE

06:12.708 --> 06:15.792
YOU GIVE ANY RANDOM STRANGER
ON THE END OF THAT PHONE.

06:17.083 --> 06:21.542
JUST MEET WITH ME FOR AN HOUR--
FOR HALF AN HOUR, EVEN.

06:22.917 --> 06:23.917
MAYBE.

06:26.875 --> 06:28.208
MAYBE?

06:28.208 --> 06:30.000
YES. MAYBE.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.041
I NEED SOME TIME
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

06:32.041 --> 06:34.959
COOL. VERY COOL.

06:34.959 --> 06:37.375
HOW MUCH TIME?

06:37.375 --> 06:39.875
I DON'T KNOW.
LOOK, I'LL--I'LL CALL YOU.

06:39.875 --> 06:41.917
OR--OR YOU KNOW,
YOU COULD JUST MEET ME

06:41.917 --> 06:43.417
DOWN AT HELL'S KITCHEN
TONIGHT IF YOU WANT.

06:43.417 --> 06:45.792
I CAN'T TONIGHT.
I HAVE A TEST TOMORROW.

06:45.792 --> 06:47.250
TOMORROW--
TOMORROW'S FINE.

06:47.250 --> 06:49.000
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW--
WHAT? AFTER 8:00?

06:50.708 --> 06:52.333
I'M WORKING UNTIL 9:00.

06:52.333 --> 06:54.208
SO YOU'RE--
YOU'RE COMING?

06:54.208 --> 06:54.875
I SAID
I WOULD THINK ABOUT IT.

06:54.875 --> 06:58.333
OK.

06:58.333 --> 06:59.625
LISTEN, I'M BUSY HERE, SO...

06:59.625 --> 07:01.625
SURE. YEAH. UNDERSTOOD.

07:10.417 --> 07:12.208
GOOD MORNING, JOHN.

07:13.625 --> 07:17.875
I HAD SEX WITH
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN LAST NIGHT.

07:17.875 --> 07:18.875
NOW, THIS SHOULD NOT
HAVE HAPPENED.

07:18.875 --> 07:19.917
SHE WAS
WAY OUT OF MY LEAGUE,

07:19.917 --> 07:20.917
AND I EVEN LIKE TO THINK

07:20.917 --> 07:21.917
THAT I'M A FAIRLY
HANDSOME GUY,

07:21.917 --> 07:23.083
BUT I'M NOT THAT HANDSOME,

07:23.083 --> 07:24.625
AND I LIKE TO THINK
THAT I'M PRETTY GOOD IN BED,

07:24.625 --> 07:25.750
BUT I'M NOT THAT GOOD.

07:25.750 --> 07:27.583
HOW DOES
SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPEN?

07:27.583 --> 07:28.959
I'LL TELL YOU.

07:28.959 --> 07:30.250
I'M 20 YEARS OLD,

07:30.250 --> 07:32.166
AND I AM DOING EXACTLY

07:32.166 --> 07:33.834
WHAT I WAS PUT
ON THIS EARTH TO DO.

07:33.834 --> 07:36.041
I AM MAKING MONEY...

07:36.041 --> 07:37.208
HAND OVER FIST...

07:37.208 --> 07:39.125
FASTER THAN I KNOW
HOW TO SPEND IT.

07:39.125 --> 07:39.792
AND LET'S TELL THE TRUTH.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.625
YOU ALL CAME HERE TODAY

07:41.625 --> 07:42.625
BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO ESCAPE

07:42.625 --> 07:44.792
THE MISERABLE
BOTTOM-FEEDING EXISTENCE

07:44.792 --> 07:46.041
THAT YOU'VE BEEN LIVING

07:46.041 --> 07:49.667
THAT HAS DENIED YOU
WHAT IS RIGHTFULLY YOURS.

07:49.667 --> 07:51.708
IF YOU WANT THIS
FOR YOURSELVES,

07:51.708 --> 07:53.625
YOU CAN HAVE IT.

07:53.625 --> 07:54.792
BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU

07:54.792 --> 07:57.250
YOU WILL GET YOUR ASSES KICKED
ON A DAILY BASIS,

07:57.250 --> 07:58.792
BUT YOU WILL LEARN.

07:58.792 --> 08:00.959
AND ULTIMATELY, YOU WILL DO

08:00.959 --> 08:02.291
WHAT YOU WERE
PUT ON THIS EARTH TO DO,

08:02.291 --> 08:05.333
WHICH IS MAKE MONEY.

08:05.333 --> 08:07.458
NOW, IF ANY OF YOU ARE STILL
INTERESTED IN THIS PROPOSITION,

08:07.458 --> 08:11.250
BE HERE 9 A.M. SHARP
MONDAY MORNING.

08:11.250 --> 08:14.291
IF YOU ARE LATE,
DO NOT COME INTO MY BUILDING.

08:14.291 --> 08:15.959
TURN AROUND, GO HOME,

08:15.959 --> 08:18.125
AND PREPARE YOURSELVES
FOR A LIFE IN RETAIL.

08:18.125 --> 08:19.125
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

08:19.125 --> 08:21.291
HEY. HOW'D IT GO?

08:21.291 --> 08:24.667
HOW DO YOU THINK IT WENT?
I LEARNED FROM THE BEST,
RIGHT?

08:24.667 --> 08:27.083
THAT'S SWEET.
YOU WANNA MAKE OUT OR...

08:27.083 --> 08:28.208
MAYBE LATER.
I GOTTA BRUSH MY TEETH.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.208
WHOO!

08:30.208 --> 08:31.375
WHAT THE HELL
IS ALL THAT ABOUT?

08:31.375 --> 08:33.500
THAT, MR. WITTER,
IS THE SOUND OF BLOOD

08:33.500 --> 08:35.041
RUSHING
TO THE NETHER REGIONS.

08:35.041 --> 08:37.082
LET ME GUESS.
THE STEPATECH APPROVAL
WENT THROUGH?

08:37.082 --> 08:39.082
NOT QUITE YET, AMIGO,
BUT THAT STOCK IS
STILL CLIMBING.

08:39.082 --> 08:40.750
OK, GOOD ENOUGH.

08:40.750 --> 08:42.250
WHY DON'T YOU CALL ROGER
AND CONGRATULATE HIM.

08:42.250 --> 08:43.375
WILL DO, BOSS.

08:43.375 --> 08:45.500
OOH, AH, HEY...

08:45.500 --> 08:47.500
THAT DATE WITH SADIA
LAST NIGHT--

08:47.500 --> 08:48.708
DID YOU
CLOSE THE DEAL?

08:48.708 --> 08:51.458
WHY DON'T YOU JUST ASK
THOSE GUYS IN THERE?

08:51.458 --> 08:54.041
OH, THAT DOES IT,
WITTER.

08:54.041 --> 08:55.667
I USED TO BE
MILDLY IMPRESSED.

08:55.667 --> 08:57.333
NOW I AM IN AWE.

08:57.333 --> 08:58.750
NICELY DONE,
MY FRIEND.

08:58.750 --> 09:00.000
NICELY DONE.

09:00.000 --> 09:00.875
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S JUST WHAT SHE SAID.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.250
MMM.

09:30.250 --> 09:32.041
MMM.

09:32.041 --> 09:36.375
WELL, THAT IS DEFINITELY
ONE OF THE BETTER WAYS
TO START THE DAY.

09:38.583 --> 09:40.959
WELL, I DO HAVE
A FEW OTHER TRICKS
UP MY SLEEVE,

09:40.959 --> 09:42.875
BUT I THOUGHT
I'D KEEP IT SIMPLE.

09:42.875 --> 09:46.625
I DIDN'T WANT
TO BLOW YOUR MIND
JUST YET.

09:47.792 --> 09:51.583
OH, MY GOD, WOMAN,
YOU ARE WAY OUT OF MY LEAGUE.

09:51.583 --> 09:54.417
I KNOW. I KNOW.

09:57.834 --> 10:00.625
OH. UH...

10:00.625 --> 10:01.667
HOLD ON ONE SEC.

10:04.500 --> 10:05.750
EXCUSE ME.

10:05.750 --> 10:08.792
I'M SORRY,
BUT TODAY'S THE DAY
THAT THE FDA IS RULING

10:08.792 --> 10:10.125
ON STEPATECH'S
MIRACLE FLU THINGIE.

10:10.125 --> 10:11.667
THINGIE?

10:11.667 --> 10:14.500
HOW CAN YOU BE SO
EXCITED ABOUT SOMETHING

10:14.500 --> 10:17.083
THAT YOU REFER TO
AS A THINGIE?

10:17.083 --> 10:18.625
I KNOW. I'M SORRY, BUT...

10:18.625 --> 10:20.417
I HAVE A LOT OF MONEY
WRAPPED UP IN THIS THINGIE.

10:20.417 --> 10:21.417
AND THIS THINGIE
IS GONNA BUY ME A NEW CAR.

10:21.417 --> 10:25.166
MAYBE EVEN A NEW HOUSE.

10:25.166 --> 10:28.959
WAIT A MINUTE.
HOW DID SOMEONE
AS YOUNG AS YOU

10:28.959 --> 10:31.208
GET TO BE
SO CAREER OBSESSED?

10:31.208 --> 10:33.041
I USED TO BE OBSESSED
ABOUT A LOT OF OTHER THINGS.

10:33.041 --> 10:34.166
MM-HMM.

10:34.166 --> 10:36.291
WELL, MOSTLY GIRLS, REALLY.

10:36.291 --> 10:38.834
AND THEN WITH THIS
ONE RECENT DALLIANCE,

10:38.834 --> 10:41.708
THAT PROBABLY WAS BETTER
LEFT IN THE PAST,

10:41.708 --> 10:43.583
I REALIZED THAT A CAREER
IS ACTUALLY

10:43.583 --> 10:45.959
A VERY HEALTHY OBSESSION.

10:45.959 --> 10:46.500
NO OFFENSE, OF COURSE.

10:46.500 --> 10:48.000
NONE TAKEN.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.875
AND IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU'RE MY BOYFRIEND
OR ANYTHING.

10:50.875 --> 10:54.583
I HAVE ONE OF THOSE,
AND, QUITE FRANKLY,

10:54.583 --> 10:56.500
THEY'RE OVERRATED.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.125
I WHOLEHEARTEDLY CONCUR.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.000
MM-HMM.

11:01.458 --> 11:05.959
AND THIS OTHER GIRL?
WELL, SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT SHE'S MISSING.

11:05.959 --> 11:08.000
WELL, LIKE I SAID,
SHE'S IN A PAST LIFE,

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
AND I'M QUITE HAPPY
WITH THE LIFE I'M LEADING.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.333
AND AS THEY SAY,
I ALWAYS HAVE MY WORK.

11:13.333 --> 11:15.375
AND THEN THERE'S ME.

11:15.375 --> 11:18.166
AND THEN THERE'S YOU,

11:18.166 --> 11:20.917
WHICH IS PROOF POSITIVE
THAT THERE IS, IN FACT,
A GOD,

11:20.917 --> 11:24.500
AND THAT PACEY J. WITTER
IS HIS FAVORITE SON.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.959
WHAT DOES THE "J"
STAND FOR?

11:26.959 --> 11:29.458
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO KNOW?

11:29.458 --> 11:31.458
WELL, IF YOU WANTED ME
TO TORTURE YOU, PACEY,

11:31.458 --> 11:32.750
ALL YOU HAD TO DO
WAS ASK.

11:32.750 --> 11:33.875
REALLY?
MM-HMM.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.291
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?
MORE COFFEE?

11:51.291 --> 11:52.333
MORE COFFEE?

11:52.333 --> 11:54.208
HOW COULD I POSSIBLY
DRINK ANY MORE COFFEE?

11:54.208 --> 11:56.959
WE'VE BEEN SITTING HERE
ENGAGED IN THIS PRE-TEST
CAFFEINATION

11:56.959 --> 11:58.333
FOR 2 HOURS NOW.

11:58.333 --> 12:00.166
I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO BE LATE, NOW, DID I?

12:03.375 --> 12:07.708
I SEEM TO RECALL THIS IS HOW
MY ACADEMIC DOWNFALL BEGAN
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

12:07.708 --> 12:10.375
WELL, IF IT ISN'T
BONNIE AND CLYDE.

12:12.750 --> 12:16.333
DON'T T.A.s USUALLY
MONITOR THESE EXAMS?

12:17.583 --> 12:20.542
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN ABOUT
MY BIONIC HEARING,
MR. DOLING.

12:20.542 --> 12:24.708
AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
I ACTUALLY ENJOY PROCTORING
MY OWN EXAMS.

12:24.708 --> 12:26.417
I MEAN, I FIGURE IF NABOKOV
HAD TIME TO DO IT

12:26.417 --> 12:28.625
WHILE HE WAS TEACHING
AT CORNELL, REALLY,

12:28.625 --> 12:32.166
WHO AM I
TO PUT MYSELF SO FAR
ABOVE THE LITTLE PEOPLE?

12:32.166 --> 12:34.083
IN OTHER WORDS,
HE DERIVES SOME
SICK PLEASURE

12:34.083 --> 12:36.125
FROM WATCHING US
SQUIRM.

12:36.125 --> 12:38.333
I CAN SEE OVER THE COURSE
OF THE LAST 2 SEMESTERS

12:38.333 --> 12:39.458
THAT YOU'VE LEARNED
HOW TO READ ME.

12:39.458 --> 12:41.750
WHETHER OR NOT YOU'VE ACQUIRED
A SIMILAR MASTERY

12:41.750 --> 12:45.417
OF POST-WAR AMERICAN LITERATURE
REALLY REMAINS TO BE SEEN.

12:47.083 --> 12:50.417
YOU KNOW, I NEVER DID
GET A CHANCE TO THANK HIM

12:50.417 --> 12:51.250
FOR HIS RECOMMENDATION.

12:51.250 --> 12:53.333
AND YOU'RE
GOING TO DO IT NOW?

12:53.333 --> 12:55.125
YEAH. WHAT'S THE WORST
THAT COULD HAPPEN?

12:55.125 --> 12:56.208
I DON'T KNOW.
HE COULD BE INCREDIBLY
RUDE AND INGRACIOUS,

12:56.208 --> 12:58.625
SAY SOMETHING MEAN
AND UNFORGIVABLE,

12:58.625 --> 13:00.583
AND YOU COULD PUNCH HIM
IN THE FACE AGAIN.

13:00.583 --> 13:02.875
I'M NOT GONNA PUNCH HIM
IN HIS FACE AGAIN.

13:02.875 --> 13:04.333
WHAT?

13:04.333 --> 13:06.083
YOU DON'T THINK
I'M CAPABLE OF BEING
THE BIGGER PERSON HERE?

13:06.083 --> 13:08.792
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
THE BIGGER PERSON.

13:08.792 --> 13:12.250
I JUST THINK
YOU'RE UNDERESTIMATING
HOW SMALL HE CAN BE.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.333
WELL,
I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THAT.

13:21.458 --> 13:23.291
HEY, UH...

13:23.291 --> 13:25.500
PROFESSOR HETSON.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.291
MR. DOLING,
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

13:28.291 --> 13:29.959
ACTUALLY, I--
I KIND OF THOUGHT

13:29.959 --> 13:32.291
MAYBE I'D LIKE TO,
UH, TO THANK YOU,

13:32.291 --> 13:36.458
FOR, YOU KNOW,
HELPING ME OUT
WITH THAT SCHOOL THING.

13:36.458 --> 13:39.291
YOU KINDA THOUGHT...

13:39.291 --> 13:44.125
MAYBE YOU'D LIKE
TO THANK ME?

13:44.125 --> 13:46.542
YOUR ELOQUENCE ASTOUNDS ME.

13:46.542 --> 13:50.333
YEAH, WELL,
I KINDA THOUGHT MAYBE
I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU,

13:50.333 --> 13:52.291
BUT NOW THAT I'VE HEARD
THE TONE OF YOUR RESPONSE,

13:52.291 --> 13:53.291
I'M THINKING MAYBE
I SHOULD JUST BAIL
ON THE WHOLE CONCEPT.

13:53.291 --> 13:55.458
WELL, THAT IS
YOUR SPECIALTY, ISN'T IT?

13:55.458 --> 13:57.083
OK, YOU TWO.

13:57.083 --> 13:59.333
DID I NOT SAY
THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN?

13:59.333 --> 14:00.708
HEY, HE STARTED IT.

14:00.708 --> 14:02.834
LET ME KNOW
WHEN YOU'VE RETURNED
FROM THE THIRD GRADE.

14:02.834 --> 14:04.542
IN THE MEANTIME,
ALL HE WAS TRYING TO SAY
IS THANK YOU.

14:04.542 --> 14:06.875
2 SIMPLE WORDS.

14:06.875 --> 14:08.792
AND I BELIEVE
THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE
IS "YOU'RE WELCOME,"

14:08.792 --> 14:10.667
MAYBE "GOOD LUCK
IN FUTURE ENDEAVORS."

14:10.667 --> 14:11.500
WELL, WHATEVER.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.083
WHATEVER.

14:13.083 --> 14:15.291
I ENCOURAGE YOU
TO ACCEPT THIS "WHATEVER,"

14:15.291 --> 14:17.166
AS I BELIEVE THIS IS
THE BEST YOU'LL EVER DO.

14:17.166 --> 14:18.500
WHATEVER.
GREAT.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.917
MY WORK HERE IS DONE.
NOW CAN YOU PLEASE LEAVE?

14:20.917 --> 14:23.208
BECAUSE I FEAR ALL OF THIS
SPONTANEOUS OUTPOURING
OF EMOTION

14:23.208 --> 14:24.500
IS REALLY THROWING ME
OFF MY TEST GAME.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.667
WHATEVER.

14:26.667 --> 14:27.959
GREAT. GOOD-BYE.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.166
ALL RIGHT. BYE.

14:38.375 --> 14:40.125
DAWSON LEERY.

14:40.125 --> 14:42.875
EXCELLENT.
PUT HIM RIGHT THROUGH.

14:42.875 --> 14:45.542
DAWSON. WHAT'S UP, MAN?

14:45.542 --> 14:47.375
HEY, PACE, NOT MUCH.

14:47.375 --> 14:49.125
UM, LISTEN,
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

14:49.125 --> 14:51.125
LET ME GUESS.
YOU'RE NERVOUS,
RIGHT?

14:51.125 --> 14:53.041
NERVOUS? WHO, ME?

14:53.041 --> 14:54.500
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AT PLAY
IN THE STOCK MARKET WHICH,

14:54.500 --> 14:58.375
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND,
CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED
AS GLOBALLY WEAK?

14:58.375 --> 14:59.834
NAH. WHO'S NERVOUS?

14:59.834 --> 15:01.959
OK, WELL,
HOW ABOUT THIS?

15:01.959 --> 15:03.458
YOU JUST TRUST ME,

15:03.458 --> 15:04.834
AND I PROMISE
THAT EVERYTHING
WILL BE ALL RIGHT.

15:04.834 --> 15:06.041
HAVE I EVER
LET YOU DOWN
IN THE PAST?

15:06.041 --> 15:09.542
ACTUALLY,
YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T ANSWER THAT.

15:09.542 --> 15:12.375
UM, BUT SERIOUSLY,
I'M NOT NERVOUS,

15:12.375 --> 15:16.041
I JUST--I'M THINKING
IT MIGHT BE TIME TO CASH OUT.

15:16.041 --> 15:17.458
I'VE GOT
A LOT OF FILM TO BUY,
AND FROM WHAT I CAN UNDERSTAND,

15:17.458 --> 15:18.959
THAT'S GONNA BE
MY BIGGEST EXPENSE, SO...

15:18.959 --> 15:21.583
OK, DAWSON,
HERE'S THE DEAL.

15:21.583 --> 15:23.291
I KNOW THAT YOU NEED
TO MAKE MONEY,

15:23.291 --> 15:24.667
AND THAT YOU NEED
TO MAKE IT FAST,

15:24.667 --> 15:26.542
SO WHAT I'VE DONE FOR YOU
IS INVESTED YOU

15:26.542 --> 15:27.959
IN THIS BIOTECH COMPANY
CALLED STEPATECH.

15:27.959 --> 15:31.250
THEY HAVE
A MIRACLE FLU VACCINE

15:31.250 --> 15:32.583
THAT IS UP FOR APPROVAL
BY THE FDA RIGHT NOW,

15:32.583 --> 15:35.875
AND THE WORD
ON THE STREET
IS IT'S A SHOO-IN.

15:35.875 --> 15:38.417
SO IF YOU CAN HOLD ON
FOR JUST A FEW MORE DAYS,

15:38.417 --> 15:40.041
I PROMISE YOU IT WILL BE
WORTH YOUR WHILE.

15:40.041 --> 15:41.750
IT'LL BE LIKE
THE DIFFERENCE

15:41.750 --> 15:43.542
BETWEEN MAKING
EL MARIACHI  AND  CLERKS.

15:45.542 --> 15:48.542
OK, WELL, AT LEAST
THAT'S JARGON I UNDERSTAND.

15:48.542 --> 15:51.125
UM...I GUESS
IN THE SPIRIT OF CLERKS,

15:51.125 --> 15:52.500
I COULD CHARGE THE FILM.

15:52.500 --> 15:53.917
I'VE BEEN APPLYING
FOR CREDIT CARDS LIKE CRAZY,

15:53.917 --> 15:55.250
AND 2 OF THEM
CAME IN THE MAIL TODAY.

15:55.250 --> 15:58.417
I THINK THAT'S
WHAT COMMONLY KNOWN
AS A SIGN, MY FRIEND.

15:58.417 --> 16:00.166
MAYBE SO. MAYBE SO.

16:00.166 --> 16:02.625
OK, SO WE'RE
COOL HERE, RIGHT?

16:02.625 --> 16:03.792
WHAT--I DON'T KNOW.

16:03.792 --> 16:06.250
IT'S ALL SOMETHING OUT OF
A DAVID MAMET MOVIE TO ME.

16:06.250 --> 16:08.000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
I'M TALKING ABOUT,

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
BUT I TRUST YOU.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.667
KEEP ME POSTED.

16:10.667 --> 16:11.959
WILL DO.
TALK TO YOU LATER, MAN.

16:24.291 --> 16:27.375
I MEAN, WHAT KIND
OF A SADIST ASKS FOR THINGS

16:27.375 --> 16:30.083
LIKE LOLITA'S MARRIED NAME,
OR WHAT DAY OF THE WEEK
IT WAS

16:30.083 --> 16:32.458
ON THE FIRST PAGE
OF GRAVITY'S RAINBOW?

16:32.458 --> 16:35.834
WELL, I DON'T KNOW, JO.
I'D SAY THAT THAT DEPENDS.

16:35.834 --> 16:36.959
ON?

16:36.959 --> 16:38.667
ON WHETHER OR NOT
YOU KNEW THE ANSWERS

16:38.667 --> 16:39.959
TO ANY
OF THOSE 2 QUESTIONS.

16:39.959 --> 16:41.041
SCHILLER.

16:41.041 --> 16:42.083
AND?

16:42.083 --> 16:43.500
MONDAY.

16:43.500 --> 16:46.166
SO WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT COMPLETELY
ACING IT HERE,

16:46.166 --> 16:48.500
NOT JUST SLIDING BY
OR A PARTIAL ACE?

16:48.500 --> 16:49.667
NO.
NO.

16:49.667 --> 16:51.875
I HAD COMPLETE
AND TOTAL MASTERY

16:51.875 --> 16:53.125
OF EVERY ARCANE FACT
IN HETSON'S UNIVERSE.

16:55.875 --> 16:58.166
SO? ARE WE GONNA CELEBRATE
OR WHAT?

16:58.166 --> 17:00.000
OF COURSE.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.959
WELL, DOES THIS CELEBRATION
INVOLVE ANYTHING

17:02.959 --> 17:05.208
OTHER THAN STANDING HERE?

17:05.208 --> 17:07.165
SO NOW THAT MY USEFULNESS
AS YOUR STUDY PARTNER
HAS ENDED,

17:07.165 --> 17:09.083
YOU JUST WANT TO SKIP
TO THE PRESENT PART.

17:09.083 --> 17:12.500
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
IT WAS A SURPRISE?

17:12.500 --> 17:15.541
WELL, YOU KNOW,
PRESENT-SLASH-SURPRISE.

17:15.541 --> 17:17.750
WELL, WHATEVER IT IS,
IS IT COMING ANYTIME SOON?

17:17.750 --> 17:20.750
UM...YEAH, ACTUALLY.
IT IS.

17:20.750 --> 17:23.165
(CLEARS THROAT)

17:23.165 --> 17:25.250
HERE.

17:25.250 --> 17:27.750
I WRAPPED IT MYSELF.

17:27.750 --> 17:29.166
YEAH, I CAN--I CAN SEE THAT.

17:32.542 --> 17:33.625
YOU DON'T LIKE IT.

17:33.625 --> 17:38.417
OH, NO. I--I--

17:38.417 --> 17:39.750
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

17:39.750 --> 17:40.667
YOU'RE GIVING ME
YOUR BACKPACK.

17:40.667 --> 17:41.708
JOEY,
IT'S NOT MY  BACKPACK.

17:41.708 --> 17:44.875
I MEAN, I BOUGHT THIS
SPECIAL JUST FOR YOU.

17:44.875 --> 17:48.875
IN FACT, YOU KNOW,
THERE MAY BE SOMETHING
INSIDE HERE.

17:48.875 --> 17:50.917
YOU PROBABLY
SHOULD CHECK.

17:50.917 --> 17:52.208
I SHOULD CHECK?

17:52.208 --> 17:53.500
YEAH. YEAH. JUST IN CASE

17:53.500 --> 17:56.125
THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL LEVEL
OF--OF GIFT.

18:09.208 --> 18:11.041
I DON'T GET IT.

18:11.041 --> 18:12.250
THAT GIRL WHO
WAS ALWAYS TELLING ME

18:12.250 --> 18:15.583
HOW SHE COULD HAVE
GONE TO PARIS.

18:15.583 --> 18:18.000
WELL, I THINK
IT'S ABOUT TIME

18:18.000 --> 18:20.708
THAT SHE PUT HER MONEY
WHERE HER MOUTH IS.

18:20.708 --> 18:23.208
AND I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT JUST PARIS HERE,
JOEY.

18:23.208 --> 18:25.166
I'M TALKING ABOUT
BARCELONA AND MADRID

18:25.166 --> 18:27.625
AND VIENNA AND PRAGUE
AND WHEREVER.

18:27.625 --> 18:28.917
I MEAN,
THE SKY'S THE LIMIT, JO.

18:28.917 --> 18:31.875
AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS JUST SAY YES.

18:31.875 --> 18:33.667
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
COMPLETELY.

18:33.667 --> 18:36.750
I WANT EVERY MOMENT
WE SPEND TOGETHER
THIS SUMMER

18:36.750 --> 18:38.917
TO BE...HISTORIC.

18:38.917 --> 18:41.208
AND I FIGURE
THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT
IS TO, YOU KNOW,

18:41.208 --> 18:42.417
GO TO WHERE
THE HISTORY IS.

18:43.959 --> 18:46.792
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

18:46.792 --> 18:50.875
OH, MY GOD! YES!

18:50.875 --> 18:52.917
YES!

19:18.667 --> 19:19.834
ALL RIGHT, JACK,
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

19:19.834 --> 19:21.875
OK, I'LL SEE YOU.

19:31.667 --> 19:32.583
HEY.

19:32.583 --> 19:35.125
HEY.

19:35.125 --> 19:37.500
THANKS FOR COMING.

19:37.500 --> 19:40.917
UH, HAVE YOU
BEEN WAITING LONG?

19:40.917 --> 19:44.291
NO. ACTUALLY,
I RAN INTO A GUY FROM
MY SOCIOLOGY CLASS.

19:44.291 --> 19:46.250
YEAH, I--I SAW.

19:49.750 --> 19:52.458
LOOK, THAT'S--THAT'S
NOT WHAT YOU THINK,
ALL RIGHT?

19:52.458 --> 19:53.500
THAT'S
COMPLETELY INNOCENT.

19:53.500 --> 19:54.500
BY WHICH YOU'RE IMPLYING

19:54.500 --> 19:55.792
THAT THE THING
THE OTHER NIGHT WASN'T.

19:55.792 --> 19:59.125
YOU'RE NOT EVEN GIVING ME
A CHANCE HERE, ARE YOU?

19:59.125 --> 20:01.000
MAN, IT'S LIKE
YOU STRUCTURED
THIS WHOLE SCENE

20:01.000 --> 20:02.750
BEFORE YOU EVEN
WALKED INTO THE PLACE.

20:02.750 --> 20:04.458
I HAD 2 VERSIONS, ACTUALLY.

20:04.458 --> 20:06.542
LET ME GUESS.
THE VERSION
YOU'RE GONNA USE

20:06.542 --> 20:07.708
IS THE ONE WHERE
I'M THE BAD GUY?

20:10.458 --> 20:12.375
YEAH.

20:12.375 --> 20:14.375
YOU LED ME ON, YOU KNOW.

20:14.375 --> 20:16.542
THE HALLOWEEN PARTY
WHERE WE FIRST MET.

20:16.542 --> 20:19.708
YOU LED ME TO BELIEVE
YOU WERE ONE OF THE UNDEAD.

20:19.708 --> 20:22.250
COME ON. LOOK,
IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA
TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY--

20:22.250 --> 20:23.500
I'M BEING SERIOUS.

20:23.500 --> 20:26.834
I HAVE A SERIOUS
TOM CRUISE-VAMPIRE LeSTAT
FANTASY

20:26.834 --> 20:29.166
THAT I NEED TO FULFILL
WHILE I'M STILL YOUNG.

20:31.208 --> 20:33.792
WHICH IS WHY
I'M BREAKING UP WITH YOU.

20:33.792 --> 20:35.291
WHAT?

20:35.291 --> 20:35.917
YEAH. YEAH, YOU KNOW,
IT HAS TO BE DONE.

20:35.917 --> 20:37.250
I WAS KIDDING MYSELF--

20:37.250 --> 20:38.708
WHOA, WHOA. HOLD ON--
HOLD ON A SECOND.

20:38.708 --> 20:39.959
IF YOU THINK I'M GONNA
LET YOU WALK OUT OF HERE
LIKE THIS,

20:39.959 --> 20:42.083
I MEAN, COME ON, DAVID.

20:42.083 --> 20:44.291
THIS ISN'T HOW
I WANTED THIS
TO TURN OUT.

20:44.291 --> 20:46.667
WELL, GUESS WHAT? IT IS,
SO IT SUCKS FOR YOU, HUH?

20:46.667 --> 20:48.542
OR MAYBE IT DOESN'T.
MAYBE YOU'RE GONNA
GET OFF EASY AFTER ALL.

20:48.542 --> 20:50.959
IT'S ONLY MY HEART
THAT'S GONNA GET EVEN
THE SLIGHTEST BIT BROKEN.

20:50.959 --> 20:52.583
WHY DO YOU
SAY THINGS LIKE THAT?

20:52.583 --> 20:55.083
I WOULDN'T BE HERE TONIGHT
IF I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE
THIS WORK.

20:55.083 --> 20:56.333
YEAH, AND YOU WOULDN'T
BE HERE AT ALL

20:56.333 --> 20:57.291
UNLESS YOU WERE TRYING
TO PROVE SOMETHING TO YOURSELF.

20:57.291 --> 20:58.750
PROVE WHAT?

20:58.750 --> 21:01.583
LOOK, JACK...

21:01.583 --> 21:02.458
I WANT WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS.

21:02.458 --> 21:05.458
I WANT TO BE IMPORTANT
TO SOMEBODY.

21:05.458 --> 21:07.667
MAYBE YOU WANT THAT, TOO,
BUT...

21:07.667 --> 21:11.917
IF YOU DO, TO BE HONEST,
I CAN'T REALLY SEE IT,

21:11.917 --> 21:14.458
BECAUSE ALL I SEE
WHEN I LOOK AT YOU

21:14.458 --> 21:16.834
IS SOMEBODY WHO'S
GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS
OF BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP

21:16.834 --> 21:18.583
BECAUSE HE THINKS
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

21:18.583 --> 21:21.041
I DON'T KNOW.

21:21.041 --> 21:23.458
I JUST KNOW THAT
THAT ISN'T ENOUGH FOR ME.

21:27.834 --> 21:28.917
SO...

21:28.917 --> 21:31.500
GOOD-BYE.

21:31.500 --> 21:32.625
WAIT.

21:33.625 --> 21:37.542
YOU'RE JUST GONNA
WALK AWAY?

21:37.542 --> 21:40.166
HAVE A GOOD SUMMER, JACK,
AND KEEP IN TOUCH.

21:54.542 --> 21:56.500
Eddie: SO PRAGUE FIRST
AND THEN BUDAPEST?

21:56.500 --> 21:58.792
OR WOULD IT MAKE MORE SENSE
TO DO IT THE OTHER WAY AROUND?

21:58.792 --> 22:00.917
OR WE COULD JUST SKIP
CENTRAL EUROPE

22:00.917 --> 22:02.208
AND STAY LONGER IN SPAIN--
ESPAÑA.

22:02.208 --> 22:05.166
NO, WE CAN'T SKIP PRAGUE.

22:05.166 --> 22:06.458
WE HAVE TO SEE THE CASTLES,

22:06.458 --> 22:10.166
PLUS WE OWE IT TO KAFKA
AND MILAN KUNDERA.

22:10.166 --> 22:12.291
YOU KNOW, I MIGHT JUST HAVE
TO IMPLEMENT A RULE

22:12.291 --> 22:13.583
THAT LIMITS YOU TO ONLY
ONE WRITER'S GRAVE
PER COUNTRY.

22:13.583 --> 22:16.792
WELL, THAT'S NEVER, EVER
GOING TO WORK, NOW,
IS IT?

22:16.792 --> 22:18.667
WHY NOT?

22:18.667 --> 22:20.208
BECAUSE
WHEN WE GET TO FRANCE,

22:20.208 --> 22:23.083
HOW ARE WE EVER
GONNA CHOOSE BETWEEN
PROUST AND FLAUBERT?

22:23.083 --> 22:25.000
AREN'T THEY THE SAME GUY?

22:25.000 --> 22:27.291
KISS ME, AND I PROMISE
NEVER TO TELL HETSON

22:27.291 --> 22:30.166
YOU UTTERED
SUCH BLASPHEMY!

22:30.166 --> 22:32.000
DEAL.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.083
BUT IF WE DO
ACTUALLY DO THIS,

22:34.083 --> 22:35.875
THERE'S PROBABLY
SOMETHING ELSE YOU NEED
TO KNOW ABOUT ME--

22:35.875 --> 22:36.792
SOMETHING I'VE NEVER
TOLD YOU BEFORE.

22:36.792 --> 22:39.750
I ALREADY KNOW.
I KNOW YOU SNORE.

22:39.750 --> 22:42.542
IN ADDITION TO MY LOVE
FOR LITERATURE,

22:42.542 --> 22:47.208
I ALSO HAVE A GREAT
AND PROFOUND APPRECIATION
FOR THE VISUAL ARTS.

22:47.208 --> 22:50.208
OH, WHAT? LIKE,
UM, DAVID,  SISTINE CHAPEL,

22:50.208 --> 22:51.583
THE MONA LISA--
THAT TYPE OF STUFF?

22:51.583 --> 22:52.583
NO, DON'T THINK
YOU'RE JUST GONNA

22:52.583 --> 22:53.917
GET AWAY WITH
THE RENAISSANCE.

22:53.917 --> 22:55.875
I'M TALKING
PICASSO IN PARIS,

22:55.875 --> 22:57.291
THE VAN GOGH MUSEUM
IN AMSTERDAM--

22:57.291 --> 22:58.166
OK, OK.
I GET IT. I GET IT.

22:58.166 --> 22:59.875
SO WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING IS

22:59.875 --> 23:01.083
THAT YOU WANT TO DO
EVERYTHING.

23:01.083 --> 23:02.875
YES!
YES.

23:02.875 --> 23:04.542
WELL,
EVERYTHING WITHIN REASON.

23:04.542 --> 23:05.667
WITHIN REASON?

23:05.667 --> 23:07.041
WELL, YEAH, I MEAN,
WE SHOULD BE

23:07.041 --> 23:08.667
SOMEWHAT PRACTICAL
ABOUT THIS.

23:08.667 --> 23:11.875
YOU WANT TO BE PRACTICAL
ABOUT RUNNING AWAY
TOGETHER?

23:11.875 --> 23:13.333
WELL, EDDIE, I MEAN,
RUNNING AWAY TOGETHER

23:13.333 --> 23:15.208
ISN'T AS EASY
AS IT LOOKS ON TV.

23:15.208 --> 23:17.375
I MEAN, BELIEVE ME.
I'VE DONE IT BEFORE.

23:17.375 --> 23:19.083
AND WE'RE GONNA GET BACK
IN THE FALL.

23:19.083 --> 23:20.375
WE'RE GONNA BE
STARTING SCHOOL.

23:20.375 --> 23:22.000
WE'RE GONNA BE
COMPLETELY BROKE.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.333
SO?

23:23.333 --> 23:25.291
SO THAT THOUGHT
DOESN'T TERRIFY YOU?

23:25.291 --> 23:26.208
NO, NOT MORE
THAN THE THOUGHT

23:26.208 --> 23:29.166
OF NOT SPENDING
THE SUMMER WITH YOU.

23:29.166 --> 23:32.959
OR NOT SEEING YOUR FACE
THE FIRST TIME YOU SEE
THE EIFFEL TOWER,

23:32.959 --> 23:35.917
OR THE LONDON BRIDGE,
OR THE PLAZA SAN MARCO
IN VENICE.

23:35.917 --> 23:40.667
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT LIKE
EITHER OF US HAVE
ANY MONEY NOW.

23:40.667 --> 23:42.583
I MEAN, WE'RE BROKE.
SO WHAT?

23:42.583 --> 23:46.708
WE START OVER.
REBUILD THINGS
FROM SCRATCH.

23:46.708 --> 23:49.083
WITH YOU IN CALIFORNIA
AND ME HERE?

23:49.083 --> 23:51.250
AND A WHOLE LIFETIME'S
WORTH OF MEMORIES.

23:51.250 --> 23:53.041
THINGS THAT'LL
NEVER LEAVE US

23:53.041 --> 23:54.834
NO MATTER
HOW BROKE WE GET.

23:54.834 --> 23:56.959
EDDIE...

23:56.959 --> 24:00.041
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT...

24:00.041 --> 24:01.625
RUNNING AWAY TOGETHER,
NO MATTER HOW ROMANTIC

24:01.625 --> 24:04.333
AND MAGICAL IT ALL SEEMS
AT THE TIME,

24:04.333 --> 24:07.083
IT DOESN'T
SOLVE ANYTHING, OK?

24:07.083 --> 24:09.208
SO WHATEVER IT IS THAT
YOU'RE RUNNING AWAY FROM,

24:09.208 --> 24:12.291
WHETHER IT BE CIRCUMSTANCES
OR GEOGRAPHY,

24:12.291 --> 24:14.583
YOU KNOW, FATE,
ANOTHER PERSON,

24:14.583 --> 24:17.000
IT'S ALWAYS GONNA BE THERE
WHEN YOU GET BACK.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.583
OK, SO WHAT WOULD
YOU SUGGEST TO SOLVE
THESE PROBLEMS, JOEY?

24:20.583 --> 24:21.959
I MEAN,
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

24:21.959 --> 24:23.125
JUST IGNORE
THE OPPORTUNITIES
THAT COME OUR WAY?

24:23.125 --> 24:24.291
NO!

24:24.291 --> 24:27.166
I'M JUST--I'M TRYING
TO BE PRACTICAL.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.125
WHICH MEANS WHAT,
EXACTLY?

24:29.125 --> 24:30.625
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST WAIT.

24:30.625 --> 24:31.250
YOU KNOW,
SCALE BACK A LITTLE.

24:31.250 --> 24:33.333
SCALE BACK?
YEAH.

24:33.333 --> 24:34.834
MAYBE WORK FOR A MONTH OR TWO
AND THEN GO.

24:34.834 --> 24:38.000
JOEY, WE'RE GONNA SPEND
THE REST OF OUR LIVES
WORKING.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.458
YEAH, AND WE HAVE
THE ENTIRE SUMMER
TO TAKE THIS TRIP.

24:40.458 --> 24:43.166
NOBODY SAID
WE HAVE TO GO TOMORROW.

24:43.166 --> 24:46.375
I DO.

24:46.375 --> 24:48.458
WHAT?

24:48.458 --> 24:50.291
YOU DON'T--

24:50.291 --> 24:53.000
YOU DON'T EVEN REALLY
WANT TO DO THIS, DO YOU?

24:53.000 --> 24:55.500
OF COURSE I WANT TO DO THIS.

24:55.500 --> 24:58.542
YEAH, BUT ONLY
ON YOUR TERMS.

24:58.542 --> 25:02.959
WELL, WHOSE TERMS
AM I SUPPOSED TO BE
DOING THIS ON, EDDIE?

25:02.959 --> 25:05.750
I MEAN, IF I'M GONNA
THROW MY LIFE ENTIRELY
OFF COURSE FOR THE CHANCE--

25:05.750 --> 25:08.041
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

25:08.041 --> 25:09.542
THROWING IT OFF COURSE?

25:09.542 --> 25:13.166
I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO THROW YOUR LIFE
OFF COURSE, JOEY.

25:13.166 --> 25:15.333
I'M TALKING ABOUT
A SUMMER HERE.

25:15.333 --> 25:17.500
ALL I'M ASKING IS
THAT YOU TAKE A LEAP.

25:17.500 --> 25:18.959
COME AWAY WITH ME.

25:18.959 --> 25:22.417
OH, LIKE SAUL BELLOW
OR ON THE ROAD?

25:22.417 --> 25:24.458
EDDIE, THOSE ARE
JUST STORIES--POEMS.

25:24.458 --> 25:26.625
LITTLE PIECES OF UNREALITY

25:26.625 --> 25:28.834
THAT WE'RE NOT MEANT
TO BASE OUR LIVES ON.

25:28.834 --> 25:30.792
EVENTUALLY WE ALWAYS
HAVE TO COME BACK

25:30.792 --> 25:31.625
AND DEAL
WITH THE REAL WORLD.

25:31.625 --> 25:32.667
SO WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

25:32.667 --> 25:35.333
YOU JUST WANNA SIT HERE
FOR YOUR ENTIRE LIFE

25:35.333 --> 25:38.000
WAITING AND HOPING
FOR THE WORLD TO COME
TO YOU?

25:38.000 --> 25:40.834
BECAUSE THE POINT
OF THOSE STORIES, JOEY,

25:40.834 --> 25:43.291
IS THAT PEOPLE'S LIVES--
THEIR REAL LIVES--
ONLY BEGIN

25:43.291 --> 25:44.500
WHEN THEY STEP OUT
INTO THE WORLD.

25:44.500 --> 25:46.792
AND WHEN YOU DO THAT,
WHEN YOU MEET IT
HEAD ON,

25:46.792 --> 25:48.792
MAYBE
YOU CHANGE THE WORLD,
MAYBE YOU DON'T,

25:48.792 --> 25:51.917
BUT THE POINT IS
IS THAT IT CHANGES YOU.

25:51.917 --> 25:53.583
AND THAT IS
WHAT PEOPLE MEAN

25:53.583 --> 25:54.708
WHEN THEY TALK
ABOUT GROWING UP.

25:54.708 --> 25:57.834
SO WHAT?
IF I WANT TO BE WITH YOU,

25:57.834 --> 25:59.583
I'M SUPPOSED TO JUST THROW

25:59.583 --> 26:01.542
ALL OF MY PREVIOUS
LIFE EXPERIENCE
OUT THE WINDOW?

26:01.542 --> 26:03.500
I'M SUPPOSED
TO JUST STOP BEING WHO I AM?

26:03.500 --> 26:05.875
WHO YOU ARE, JOEY,
IS NOT SOME SCARED
LITTLE GIRL

26:05.875 --> 26:08.041
WHO'S AFRAID
TO TAKE CHANCES
ON ANYTHING,

26:08.041 --> 26:09.917
WHO'S AFRAID
TO REALLY LOVE SOMEONE

26:09.917 --> 26:12.208
BECAUSE OF THE RISK
OR THE PAIN.

26:12.208 --> 26:14.708
THAT DOES NOT DEFINE YOU
AS A PERSON.

26:14.708 --> 26:16.375
OR MAYBE IT DOES,
YOU KNOW?

26:16.375 --> 26:17.792
MAYBE--MAYBE I'M CRAZY.

26:18.625 --> 26:20.667
MAYBE
YOU'VE JUST BLINDED ME.

26:25.375 --> 26:28.333
ARE YOU DONE?

26:30.083 --> 26:34.667
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY FIND
SOMEWHERE ELSE TO SLEEP TONIGHT.

26:53.250 --> 26:55.083
HI, GUYS.

27:07.750 --> 27:11.250
BELIEVE ME, IT'S LIKE
A MORGUE AROUND HERE.

27:11.250 --> 27:13.917
HEY, LOOK, I TOOK
A MAJOR HIT, TOO.

27:14.792 --> 27:15.959
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL TALK TO YOU SOON.

27:15.959 --> 27:18.708
AND DO ME A FAVOR.
STAY AWAY FROM OPEN WINDOWS.

27:18.708 --> 27:21.625
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT
HOW THEY HAD TO SCRAPE YOU
OFF THE SIDEWALK OR SOMETHING.

27:21.625 --> 27:23.083
HE DIDN'T THINK
THAT WAS VERY FUNNY.

27:23.083 --> 27:26.625
YEAH, GO FIGURE.
WHAT THE HELL
IS HAPPENING HERE, RICH?

27:26.625 --> 27:28.542
FIRST OF ALL, YOU'RE LATE.
WHERE THE HELL YOU BEEN?

27:28.542 --> 27:29.959
AH, FORGET IT.
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT

27:29.959 --> 27:31.792
YOUR SEXUAL EXPLOITS
WITH LOIS LANE.

27:31.792 --> 27:33.000
I'M DEPRESSED ENOUGH
AS IT IS.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.041
I'M BEING SERIOUS.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

27:35.041 --> 27:37.792
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU THINK, DUMBASS?

27:37.792 --> 27:39.750
FDA ISSUED THEIR RULING
THIS MORNING.

27:39.750 --> 27:41.917
BIG FAT REJECTION.

27:41.917 --> 27:45.875
BUT RICH,
YOU SAID STEPATECH
WAS A SURE THING.

27:45.875 --> 27:48.458
YEAH, WELL,
SO DID EVERYONE ELSE.

27:48.458 --> 27:51.083
TURNS OUT ROGER'S
MIRACLE FLU MEDICATION

27:51.083 --> 27:53.083
HAS A BUNCH
OF NASTY SIDE EFFECTS

27:53.083 --> 27:56.333
THE FDA DOES NOT WISH
TO INFLICT ON THE
AMERICAN PUBLIC AT THIS TIME.

27:56.333 --> 27:58.500
RICH, THIS IS
A DISASTER.

27:58.500 --> 28:00.458
SETTLE DOWN, ROOKIE.

28:00.458 --> 28:01.792
I'VE SEEN WORSE.
I'VE LOST MORE.

28:01.792 --> 28:05.458
WE'LL GET OVER IT.
LIVE TO TRADE ANOTHER DAY.

28:05.458 --> 28:06.959
LIVE TO TRADE
ANOTHER DAY?

28:06.959 --> 28:08.291
I'VE BEEN
SHOVING STEPATECH
DOWN MY CLIENT'S THROATS

28:08.291 --> 28:09.500
FOR 6 MONTHS.

28:09.500 --> 28:13.750
PACEY, STOCK MARKET 101--

28:13.750 --> 28:15.458
BIOTECH STOCKS ARE SKETCHY,

28:15.458 --> 28:17.875
ESPECIALLY THESE DAYS.

28:17.875 --> 28:20.542
YOU'RE GOING TO GET SCREAMED
AND YELLED AT TODAY,
BUT IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

28:20.542 --> 28:23.250
IT'S JUST
A PROFESSIONAL HAZARD.

28:26.583 --> 28:28.125
OH, MAN, YOU ALL RIGHT?

28:28.125 --> 28:29.458
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE
GOING TO TOSS YOUR COOKIES.

28:29.458 --> 28:31.083
NO, I'LL BE FINE.

28:31.083 --> 28:32.166
LISTEN...

28:32.166 --> 28:35.208
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.
GO BACK TO YOUR OFFICE.

28:35.208 --> 28:36.708
YOU PROBABLY HAVE
A HUNDRED PHONE CALLS
TO RETURN BY NOW.

28:36.708 --> 28:40.959
LISTEN TO 'EM,
BE CONCERNED,

28:40.959 --> 28:42.333
BE SYMPATHETIC,
BUT BE STRONG.

28:42.333 --> 28:46.208
AND REMEMBER,
THEY GOT THEMSELVES
INTO THIS MESS, NOT YOU.

28:46.208 --> 28:47.083
GOT IT?

28:47.083 --> 28:49.708
NOW GET OUT OF HERE.
GET TO WORK.

29:08.458 --> 29:10.375
SO POTTER...

29:10.375 --> 29:12.792
HERE WE ARE AGAIN,

29:12.792 --> 29:14.583
RIGHT BACK WHERE
WE STARTED FROM.

29:14.583 --> 29:16.166
ADVISOR...

29:16.166 --> 29:17.917
ADVISEE...

29:17.917 --> 29:22.333
AND YOU STILL
NO CLOSER TO HAVING
DECLARED A MAJOR.

29:22.333 --> 29:25.875
I DIDN'T WANT
TO GIVE YOU THE SATISFACTION,
BUT...ENGLISH.

29:27.542 --> 29:28.583
ENGLISH.

29:28.583 --> 29:29.792
YEAH. I MEAN, I CAN
ALWAYS CHANGE IT LATER

29:29.792 --> 29:32.041
TO SOMETHING LIKE
MARINE BIOLOGY, BUT...

29:33.750 --> 29:35.917
CAN I GO NOW?

29:35.917 --> 29:38.917
WHAT, NO INTEREST
IN TRIPPING DOWN
MEMORY LANE WITH ME?

29:38.917 --> 29:40.917
NOT PARTICULARLY, NO.

29:40.917 --> 29:43.792
I DO HAVE OTHER THINGS
ON MY PLATE AT THE MOMENT.

29:43.792 --> 29:45.834
YEAH, UM...

29:45.834 --> 29:48.917
THAT FIRST TIME YOU CAME
TO MY OFFICE HERE,

29:48.917 --> 29:51.417
THAT WAS
YOUR BIRTHDAY, RIGHT?

29:51.417 --> 29:52.500
MY BIRTHDAY?

29:52.500 --> 29:54.750
YEAH.

29:54.750 --> 29:57.625
THE DAY BEFORE MY BIRTHDAY.

29:57.625 --> 29:58.834
SO HOW WAS IT?

29:58.834 --> 29:59.917
MY BIRTHDAY?

29:59.917 --> 30:00.917
YEAH.

30:00.917 --> 30:03.458
SORRY I DIDN'T
GET YOU ANYTHING.

30:03.458 --> 30:04.708
YOU KNOW WHAT?

30:04.708 --> 30:08.000
I REALIZE THAT THIS
IS VERY EXCITING FOR YOU,

30:08.000 --> 30:09.291
SITTING ME DOWN
AND REMINDING ME

30:09.291 --> 30:11.458
HOW I WASTED
AN ENTIRE YEAR OF MY LIFE

30:11.458 --> 30:14.500
AND NEVER REALLY
ACTUALLY LIVED UP
TO MY ACADEMIC POTENTIAL.

30:14.500 --> 30:15.834
BUT...

30:17.125 --> 30:20.291
YOU MORE THAN LIVED UP
TO YOUR POTENTIAL, JOEY.

30:25.917 --> 30:26.959
AN A-MINUS?

30:27.500 --> 30:30.291
THIS MEANS...

30:30.291 --> 30:32.708
FACTORING IN
ALL YOUR PAPERS FROM
THIS SEMESTER AND LAST

30:32.708 --> 30:34.959
BRINGS YOUR GRADE TO
A C-PLUS FOR THE YEAR.

30:34.959 --> 30:38.000
JUST SLIGHTLY
ABOVE AVERAGE.

30:40.166 --> 30:41.792
YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH THAT?

30:41.792 --> 30:43.458
NO. NO.

30:45.166 --> 30:46.000
YOU KNOW, THE SAD THING

30:46.000 --> 30:48.166
IS THAT I ALMOST
GAVE YOU AN "A."

30:48.166 --> 30:51.000
I WENT BACK AND FORTH
ABOUT IT, AND THEN...

30:51.000 --> 30:54.625
ULTIMATELY, I FOUND
YOUR ESSAY ON CATCH 22
A LITTLE BLEAK.

30:54.625 --> 30:57.875
YOU FOUND IT BLEAK?

30:57.875 --> 31:00.500
IT'S A STORY
OF HOPE, JOEY.

31:00.500 --> 31:02.125
I MEAN, THIS MAN,

31:02.125 --> 31:05.208
CONFRONTED WITH
THE ABSOLUTE ABSURDITY
OF THE HUMAN CONDITION,

31:05.208 --> 31:08.000
HE'S TERRIFIED
TO HIS CORE.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.750
HE TAKES A LEAP
OF FAITH.

31:10.750 --> 31:12.041
HE CHOOSES LIFE.

31:14.750 --> 31:16.500
HERE. PAGE 461.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.708
READ THE PART
THAT'S MARKED.

31:24.375 --> 31:26.375
"THEY'LL HAVE TO TRY LIKE HELL
TO CATCH ME THIS TIME.

31:26.375 --> 31:27.291
"THEY WILL TRY LIKE HELL.

31:27.291 --> 31:28.333
"AND EVEN IF
THEY DON'T FIND YOU,

31:28.333 --> 31:29.000
"WHAT KIND OF WAY
IS THAT TO LIVE?

31:29.000 --> 31:30.667
"YOU'LL ALWAYS BE ALONE,

31:30.667 --> 31:31.834
"NO ONE WILL EVER BE
ON YOUR SIDE,

31:31.834 --> 31:34.041
AND YOU'LL ALWAYS LIVE
IN DANGER OF BETRAYAL."

31:38.417 --> 31:39.375
"I LIVE THAT WAY NOW.

31:39.375 --> 31:40.708
"BUT YOU CAN'T
JUST TURN YOUR BACK ON

31:40.708 --> 31:43.000
ALL YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES
AND RUN AWAY FROM THEM,"

31:43.000 --> 31:44.125
MAJOR DANBY INSISTED.

31:44.125 --> 31:46.208
"IT'S SUCH A NEGATIVE MOOD.
IT'S ESCAPIST."

31:46.208 --> 31:47.625
YOSSARIAN LAUGHED
WITH BUOYANT SCORN

31:47.625 --> 31:48.875
AND SHOOK HIS HEAD.

31:48.875 --> 31:51.250
"I'M NOT RUNNING AWAY
FROM MY RESPONSIBILITIES.

31:51.250 --> 31:53.375
"I'M RUNNING TO THEM.

31:53.375 --> 31:55.792
"THERE'S NOTHING NEGATIVE
ABOUT RUNNING AWAY

31:55.792 --> 31:57.834
TO SAVE MY LIFE."

32:02.708 --> 32:04.333
AS I SAID IN CLASS,

32:04.333 --> 32:07.166
A LOT OF CRITICS
FIND THAT MOMENT
TOO SENTIMENTAL.

32:07.166 --> 32:09.667
AN AUTHOR
HAM-FISTEDLY
REACHING IN

32:09.667 --> 32:11.250
AND INJECTING
AN AMORAL TALE
WITH A MORAL.

32:11.250 --> 32:14.333
AN EMBARRASSING BETRAYAL
OF ALL THE DARK COMEDY

32:14.333 --> 32:17.417
THAT CAME BEFORE IT.
BUT ME?

32:17.417 --> 32:20.750
I'VE ALWAYS
KIND OF LIKED IT.

32:20.750 --> 32:24.834
IT HAS SUCH A NICE,
HOPEFUL RING TO IT.

32:24.834 --> 32:26.125
DO YOU SEE MY POINT?

32:29.667 --> 32:31.792
YES, I DO.

32:31.792 --> 32:33.250
I'M SORRY,
DID IT SEEM
LIKE I WAS DONE?

32:33.250 --> 32:37.542
I KIND OF HAVE SOMEPLACE
I NEED TO BE RIGHT NOW.

32:37.542 --> 32:38.834
WE CAN CONTINUE THIS
NEXT SEMESTER.

32:38.834 --> 32:41.125
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK
I'M EVER GONNA LET YOU

32:41.125 --> 32:41.458
INTO ONE OF
MY CLASSES AGAIN?

32:41.458 --> 32:43.417
NO.

32:43.417 --> 32:45.291
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK
I'M EVER GONNA SIGN UP

32:45.291 --> 32:46.917
FOR ONE OF
YOUR CLASSES AGAIN?

32:46.917 --> 32:50.375
BUT I DO NEED AN ADVISOR.

32:50.375 --> 32:52.625
AND YOU'D LIKE
THAT TO BE ME?

32:52.625 --> 32:53.875
YES, I WOULD.

32:53.875 --> 32:56.750
BECAUSE IT IS MY FONDEST WISH
TO CONTINUE TORMENTING YOU

32:56.750 --> 33:00.250
UNTIL THE DAY
I FINALLY LEAVE
THIS INSTITUTION.

33:00.250 --> 33:03.458
BUT IF IT WORKS OUT
THAT I NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN

33:03.458 --> 33:05.458
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,
THAT'S FINE, TOO.

33:05.458 --> 33:07.792
BYE-BYE.

33:12.125 --> 33:16.250
SO THERE IS A SOUL
IN THERE SOMEWHERE.

33:16.250 --> 33:17.583
AND TO THINK
I JUST ASSUMED

33:17.583 --> 33:20.125
YOU WERE ANOTHER ONE
OF RICH RINALDI'S
PET SHARKS.

33:20.125 --> 33:23.458
SADIA, I JUST SCREWED OVER
MY BEST FRIEND.

33:23.458 --> 33:26.000
I'VE BEEN FEELING SICK
TO MY STOMACH ALL DAY.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.291
AND RICH WAS RIGHT,
THE REST OF MY CLIENTS

33:27.291 --> 33:28.667
KNEW WHAT THEY WERE
GETTING THEMSELVES INTO.

33:28.667 --> 33:30.959
BUT DAWSON ENTRUSTED ME
WITH HIS ENTIRE LIFE SAVINGS,

33:30.959 --> 33:33.834
AND I PISSED IT ALL AWAY.

33:33.834 --> 33:34.667
HOW COULD
I LET THAT HAPPEN?

33:34.667 --> 33:37.000
OK, THIS HAPPENS
ALL THE TIME.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.375
IT'S JUST THE LIFE
OF BEING A BROKER.

33:39.375 --> 33:40.959
WELL, THAT'S NOT
ACCEPTABLE TO ME.

33:40.959 --> 33:42.417
I HAVE TO FIX THIS.

33:42.417 --> 33:46.333
DO YOU MIND
IF I ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS?

33:46.333 --> 33:47.667
YEAH, SURE.

33:47.667 --> 33:48.500
ON THE RECORD?

33:48.500 --> 33:52.333
OK, UM...

33:52.333 --> 33:53.667
MAYBE LATER?

33:53.667 --> 33:56.166
LATER, YEAH.
I THINK LATER WOULD
PROBABLY BE BETTER.

33:56.166 --> 33:57.917
THANK YOU.

33:57.917 --> 34:00.041
OH, NOT TONIGHT, THOUGH.
I ALREADY HAVE PLANS.

34:00.041 --> 34:02.375
LET ME GUESS,
THE BOYFRIEND?

34:02.375 --> 34:04.834
FIANCÉ, ACTUALLY.

34:04.834 --> 34:07.542
THE FIANCÉ?
REALLY?

34:07.542 --> 34:08.917
OH, THE HITS
JUST KEEP ON COMING.

34:08.917 --> 34:11.375
NO, IT--

34:11.375 --> 34:14.125
IT'S JUST THIS
LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP,
YOU KNOW,

34:14.125 --> 34:17.291
AND IT'S JUST KIND
OF BORING AND--YOU KNOW?

34:17.291 --> 34:18.041
OH, RIGHT.
WELL, SO LONG
AS IT'S BORING,

34:18.041 --> 34:19.250
THAT MAKES
EVERYTHING OK.

34:24.208 --> 34:27.792
WELL, IT WAS GOOD
WHILE IT LASTED,
I GUESS.

34:33.708 --> 34:36.208
CALL ME
IF YOU WANT TO TALK.

34:36.208 --> 34:37.708
SURE.

34:40.417 --> 34:41.792
SURE.

34:52.667 --> 34:55.125
YOU'RE WELCOME.
BYE.

35:02.083 --> 35:03.333
HEY.

35:03.333 --> 35:04.208
HEY.

35:09.083 --> 35:11.750
EITHER YOU
JUST FAILED AN EXAM

35:11.750 --> 35:15.125
OR LAST NIGHT DIDN'T GO
AS WELL AS I EXPECTED IT TO.

35:15.125 --> 35:18.708
YOU KNOW I'VE NEVER
REALLY CARED THAT MUCH
ABOUT SCHOOL.

35:18.708 --> 35:21.667
I'M SORRY.

35:21.667 --> 35:23.917
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

35:23.917 --> 35:26.417
DO YOU THINK THAT
I WAS JUST GOING
OUT WITH DAVID

35:26.417 --> 35:28.458
TO PROVE SOMETHING
TO MYSELF?

35:28.458 --> 35:30.542
SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT?

35:30.542 --> 35:32.166
JUST TO PROVE
THAT I COULD DO IT,

35:32.166 --> 35:32.959
THAT I COULD BE
IN A RELATIONSHIP.

35:32.959 --> 35:35.458
YOU KNOW,
HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

35:35.458 --> 35:38.458
I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, IS THAT SOMETHING

35:38.458 --> 35:40.625
THAT YOU FEEL
LIKE YOU NEEDED
TO PROVE TO YOURSELF?

35:40.625 --> 35:42.166
YEAH.

35:42.166 --> 35:45.542
WHO WANTS TO BE
THAT 35-YEAR-OLD GUY
THAT'S LIVING ALONE

35:45.542 --> 35:47.000
AND STILL GOING OUT
TO THE BAR SCENE

35:47.000 --> 35:49.291
TRYING TO FIND
THE RIGHT PERSON?

35:49.291 --> 35:51.125
GIVE ME A BREAK.
YOU'RE 20 YEARS OLD.

35:51.125 --> 35:53.291
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
LEGALLY OLD ENOUGH

35:53.291 --> 35:55.041
TO BE IN THOSE BARS,
LET ALONE HAUNT THEM

35:55.041 --> 35:58.250
WITH YOUR SAD,
SINGLE SELF.

35:58.250 --> 36:01.291
YEAH, THAT FROM
THE GIRL WHO WAS ON
A FIRST-NAME BASIS

36:01.291 --> 36:03.125
WITH HALF
THE BOUNCERS
IN NEW YORK.

36:03.125 --> 36:06.792
LOOK, MY POINT IS
IS THAT I DON'T THINK

36:06.792 --> 36:08.458
THAT EVERYBODY MEETS
THE LOVE OF THEIR LIFE

36:08.458 --> 36:09.959
WHEN THEY'RE A TEENAGER.

36:09.959 --> 36:12.667
OR WHEN THEY'RE 25.
OR EVEN WHEN THEY'RE 35.

36:12.667 --> 36:16.708
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT YOU STOP LOOKING
AND HOPING.

36:16.708 --> 36:18.083
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE YOU
WILL MEET THAT PERSON,

36:18.083 --> 36:19.083
AND WHEN YOU DO,

36:19.083 --> 36:21.750
I GUESS YOU KNOW IT.

36:21.750 --> 36:23.667
YOU'RE GONNA END UP
WITH C.J.

36:23.667 --> 36:25.250
YOU KNOW DAVID
USED TO SAY THAT

36:25.250 --> 36:27.667
HE KNEW YOU GUYS
WERE GONNA STICK

36:27.667 --> 36:28.917
BECAUSE YOU
GAVE HIM HOPE.

36:28.917 --> 36:31.166
ME?
Jack: YEAH.

36:31.166 --> 36:33.250
I MEAN,
YOU GIVE ME HOPE.

36:33.250 --> 36:34.250
YOU DID IT,
DIDN'T YOU?

36:34.250 --> 36:36.041
YOU FOUND SOMEBODY
THAT MAKES YOU HAPPY.

36:36.041 --> 36:38.333
SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT GAY.

36:38.333 --> 36:40.667
YEAH, WELL,
HE'S SLIGHTLY GAY,

36:40.667 --> 36:44.041
IF ONLY IN THE SEVENTH GRADE
SENSE OF THE TERM.

36:44.041 --> 36:46.959
HE DOES MAKE ME HAPPY.

36:48.166 --> 36:50.291
EVEN WHEN THINGS
ARE AWFUL.

36:54.250 --> 36:58.166
YOU KNOW, I'D SHARE HIM
WITH YOU IF I COULD.

36:58.166 --> 37:00.291
THANKS, BUT THAT'S
NOT NECESSARY.

37:05.792 --> 37:09.333
(SIGHS)

37:09.333 --> 37:11.291
WHO DO WE HAVE LEFT,
MISS SEATER?

37:11.291 --> 37:15.041
Miss Seater:
JUST DAWSON LEERY.
YOU WANT HIM?

37:15.041 --> 37:17.333
PACEY, DO YOU WANT HIM?

37:26.166 --> 37:27.375
NO, NO.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
HOLD ME UP.

37:27.375 --> 37:29.917
I'VE GOT A HOT DATE
OF MY OWN TONIGHT.

37:29.917 --> 37:31.542
I ADMIT IT.
YOU SHAMED ME, WITTER.

37:31.542 --> 37:32.667
NOW I GOTTA
SPEND MY NIGHTS

37:32.667 --> 37:34.417
KEEPING UP WITH
MY FRIGGIN' PROTGEGEE.

37:34.417 --> 37:35.458
OK, THAT'S GREAT.
I JUST--

37:35.458 --> 37:36.333
I WANT TO ASK YOU
ONE THING BEFORE YOU GO.

37:36.333 --> 37:38.417
AS LONG AS IT
DOESN'T INVOLVE ME

37:38.417 --> 37:40.166
HOLDING YOU
WHILE YOU CRY.

37:40.166 --> 37:42.208
I PROMISE.

37:42.208 --> 37:43.875
WHAT IS IT, KID?

37:45.750 --> 37:49.125
WELL, I WAS JUST
WONDERING IF MAYBE
YOU COULD COVER ME?

37:49.125 --> 37:51.583
LOAN ME
A LITTLE MONEY?

37:51.583 --> 37:54.083
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

37:54.083 --> 37:58.250
NO.
I WISH I WAS, BUT...

37:58.250 --> 37:59.708
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW HARD IT IS

37:59.708 --> 38:00.750
FOR ME TO ASK YOU
FOR THIS, RICH,

38:00.750 --> 38:02.250
BUT A FRIEND OF MINE
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO,

38:02.250 --> 38:04.875
HE CAME TO ME
AND HE WANTED

38:04.875 --> 38:06.041
TO DOUBLE HIS MONEY
REALLY FAST.

38:06.041 --> 38:07.625
SO I JUST PUT IT ALL
INTO STEPATECH.

38:07.625 --> 38:11.417
THAT WAS
A STUPID MOVE, PACEY.

38:11.417 --> 38:14.125
BUT HE WANTED
TO PULL OUT,

38:14.125 --> 38:16.166
AND I TOLD HIM NOT TO,
I TOLD HIM TO
JUST TRUST ME

38:16.166 --> 38:17.542
AND RIDE THE THING OUT,
AND THIS GUY IS

38:17.542 --> 38:20.792
MY OLDEST AND CLOSEST
CHILDHOOD FRIEND.

38:20.792 --> 38:22.834
I CANNOT SCREW HIM
LIKE THIS, RICH.

38:22.834 --> 38:24.041
IT'S ALREADY DONE,
PACEY.

38:24.041 --> 38:24.917
NO, I'M SERIOUS.

38:24.917 --> 38:26.792
ALL I WANT TO DO
IS GIVE HIM BACK

38:26.792 --> 38:27.875
HIS INITIAL
INVESTMENT.

38:27.875 --> 38:28.834
AND THEN
I'LL PAY YOU BACK

38:28.834 --> 38:30.834
WITH WHATEVER
INTEREST YOU WANT.

38:30.834 --> 38:32.125
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

38:32.125 --> 38:33.542
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR DISPOSABLE INCOME?

38:33.542 --> 38:34.750
I GOT NOTHING LEFT.

38:34.750 --> 38:36.625
EVERYTHING I HAD
WAS IN STEPATECH.

38:36.625 --> 38:39.458
I'M WORTH LIKE,
I DON'T KNOW,
300 BUCKS RIGHT NOW.

38:39.458 --> 38:42.792
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.

38:42.792 --> 38:44.250
YOU'RE SO GOOD
AT YOUR JOB,

38:44.250 --> 38:45.208
YOU'RE SO CONFIDENT,

38:45.208 --> 38:47.083
I SOMETIMES FORGET
HOW YOUNG

38:47.083 --> 38:48.291
AND STUPID YOU ARE.

38:48.291 --> 38:50.792
PLEASE, RICH,
I NEED YOUR HELP,

38:50.792 --> 38:51.625
NOT THE SPEECH
RIGHT NOW, OK?

38:51.625 --> 38:53.208
OH, I THINK YOU DO,
ACTUALLY.

38:53.208 --> 38:55.208
AND I'M GONNA SAY TO YOU

38:55.208 --> 38:56.500
WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE
TOLD YOUR LITTLE FRIEND

38:56.500 --> 38:56.834
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

38:56.834 --> 38:58.875
NO.

38:58.875 --> 39:01.375
THAT'S IT?

39:01.375 --> 39:02.375
THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE
TO SAY TO ME?

39:02.375 --> 39:03.750
I COME TO YOU,
I EMBARRASS MYSELF,

39:03.750 --> 39:05.583
AND YOU'RE JUST
GONNA SAY NO?

39:05.583 --> 39:07.333
PRETTY MUCH, YEAH.

39:07.333 --> 39:08.667
(CHUCKLES)

39:08.667 --> 39:11.291
YOU KNOW, RICH,
SOMETIMES YOU'RE
SO GOOD AT YOUR JOB

39:11.291 --> 39:13.792
I FORGET WHAT
AN UNFEELING PRICK
YOU ARE.

39:13.792 --> 39:14.959
YOU WORK FOR ME.
I'M YOUR BOSS.

39:14.959 --> 39:16.166
YOU WATCH YOUR TONE.

39:16.166 --> 39:18.333
OK, RICH,
I'M JUST ASKING YOU
FOR THIS ONE FAVOR!

39:18.333 --> 39:19.333
JUST ONE TIME!

39:19.333 --> 39:24.333
I...DON'T...DO...
FAVORS, WITTER.

39:24.333 --> 39:25.834
WHY NOT?
'CAUSE GOD FORBID
YOU HAVE TO DROP

39:25.834 --> 39:26.917
THE GORDON GEKKO ROUTINE
FOR A SECOND?

39:26.917 --> 39:29.208
I MEAN, THIS WOULD BE
SO EASY FOR YOU, MAN.

39:29.208 --> 39:30.583
JUST HELP ME OUT HERE!

39:30.583 --> 39:31.333
HELP YOU OUT?!

39:31.333 --> 39:34.000
I GAVE YOU
A JOB, WITTER!

39:34.000 --> 39:36.166
I GAVE YOU A CHANCE
TO ESCAPE SOME
BOTTOM FEEDER EXISTENCE,

39:36.166 --> 39:38.542
AND EVERY STEP
OF THE WAY,

39:38.542 --> 39:41.792
YOU HAVE BEEN
A HOLIER-THAN-THOU
PAIN IN THE ASS.

39:41.792 --> 39:42.875
SO YOU TELL ME,

39:42.875 --> 39:45.291
WHY SHOULD
I HELP YOU OUT?

39:47.125 --> 39:48.750
TAKE THIS PEN.

39:48.750 --> 39:49.750
TAKE THIS PEN,
WITTER,

39:49.750 --> 39:51.375
AND WRITE DOWN
TODAY'S DATE.

39:51.375 --> 39:52.500
BECAUSE FROM
THIS DAY FORWARD,

39:52.500 --> 39:54.959
YOU'RE GOING
TO AMOUNT TO NOTHING.

39:54.959 --> 39:57.166
YOU ARE A FAILURE
AND A LOSER,

39:57.166 --> 39:58.875
AND YOU DESERVE
EVERYTHING THAT CAN--

39:58.875 --> 40:00.917
UHH!

40:19.875 --> 40:21.333
IT'S ALL OVER, PACE.

40:21.333 --> 40:23.583
DON'T WORRY...

40:23.583 --> 40:25.417
YOU'RE FIRED.

40:25.417 --> 40:29.166
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED
ALL ALONG, ANYWAY.

40:29.166 --> 40:29.750
LOSER.

40:44.250 --> 40:46.834
HEY, I'M ALL
FOR GOING TO EUROPE,
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND

40:46.834 --> 40:48.583
WHY ANYONE WOULD
WANT TO DO IT
ON $5.00 A DAY.

40:48.583 --> 40:51.417
$5.00 DOESN'T EVEN
BUY YOU A PINT

40:51.417 --> 40:53.166
OF GUINNESS IN DUBLIN.

40:53.166 --> 40:54.667
Joey: THE REGISTRAR
CLOSES IN 10 MINUTES.

40:54.667 --> 40:57.625
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
A COURSE CATALOG.

40:57.625 --> 40:59.250
I KNOW.

40:59.250 --> 41:00.417
BUT ALL THE SUMMER
SCHOOL CLASSES

41:00.417 --> 41:03.333
JUST LOOK
SO BORING, JOEY!

41:03.333 --> 41:05.333
WHO WAS IT THAT SAID
YOU SHOULD NEVER
TAKE A CLASS

41:05.333 --> 41:06.333
WHERE BEOWULF  IS
REQUIRED READING?

41:06.333 --> 41:08.333
ME.

41:08.333 --> 41:09.792
SILLY ME, I THOUGHT
IT WAS WOODY ALLEN.

41:09.792 --> 41:10.625
AUDREY, UNLESS YOU'RE
PLANNING ON ENROLLING

41:10.625 --> 41:12.583
IN SANTA MONICA
JUNIOR COLLEGE,

41:12.583 --> 41:13.542
YOU'D BETTER HURRY.

41:13.542 --> 41:16.792
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

41:16.792 --> 41:17.792
AND CAN YOU
HAND ME THAT BOOK?

41:17.792 --> 41:20.208
I HAVE TO START
MY READING FOR MY TRIP.

41:20.208 --> 41:23.041
WHAT?! SINCE WHEN
DID YOU DECIDE TO GO?

41:23.041 --> 41:25.291
SINCE NOW.

41:25.291 --> 41:26.792
JOEY POTTER,
YOU ARE JUST FULL
OF LITTLE SURPRISES.

41:30.083 --> 41:32.208
CIAO, BELLA!

41:51.375 --> 41:54.583
Eddie, reading:
"DEAR JOEY,

41:54.583 --> 41:57.583
"AS YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT GOOD
AT GOOD-BYES,

41:57.583 --> 42:00.208
"BUT I GUESS
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS.

42:00.208 --> 42:02.333
"A REAL ONE THIS TIME.

42:02.333 --> 42:03.500
"BECAUSE AS MUCH
AS I THOUGHT

42:03.500 --> 42:05.875
"I WANTED US
TO BE TOGETHER,

42:05.875 --> 42:08.792
"I GUESS WHAT I WANT MORE
IS TO BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE

42:08.792 --> 42:10.500
"WHO LIVES EVERY MOMENT
OF HIS LIFE

42:10.500 --> 42:14.125
"WITHOUT INDECISION
AND WITHOUT REGRETS.

42:14.125 --> 42:16.000
"SOMEONE WHO DARES
TO DISTURB THE UNIVERSE

42:16.000 --> 42:19.417
"WITHOUT A THOUGHT
TO THE CONSEQUENCES.

42:19.417 --> 42:21.625
"AND YOU'RE NOT ONE
OF THOSE PEOPLE,

42:21.625 --> 42:24.000
"AT LEAST NOT YET.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.166
"MAYBE YOU'LL PROVE ME WRONG
ABOUT THAT ONE DAY.

42:26.166 --> 42:28.708
"I HOPE YOU DO.

42:28.708 --> 42:31.542
"BUT WHO KNOWS?
MAYBE PEOPLE CAN'T CHANGE.

42:31.542 --> 42:32.959
"MAYBE WE'RE DOOMED
TO REPEAT THE SAME MISTAKES

42:32.959 --> 42:38.542
"OVER AND OVER AGAIN
NO MATTER HOW HARD WE TRY.

42:38.542 --> 42:41.291
"I ALWAYS HOPE
FOR A HAPPY ENDING.

42:41.291 --> 42:45.208
"HOW CRAZY IS THAT?

42:45.208 --> 42:47.417
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF."
