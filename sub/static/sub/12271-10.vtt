00:19.152 --> 00:21.737
(sighs)

00:21.822 --> 00:24.073
Whatever.

00:47.814 --> 00:50.600
(whirring)

01:00.049 --> 01:03.663
So long, girl next door.

01:08.835 --> 01:11.087
(doorbell rings)

01:12.390 --> 01:15.191
Mom. What are you doing here?
Oh, Kristen said

01:15.226 --> 01:17.444
you were blue, so
Mommy's come to make it

01:17.528 --> 01:19.779
all better.

01:21.399 --> 01:24.033
I-I appreciate
your concern,

01:24.068 --> 01:26.403
but I-I just
want to be alone.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.905
No, you want to be with Wilfred.

01:31.659 --> 01:33.993
You know, some people believe
that animals choose us.

01:34.497 --> 01:38.049
They come into our lives
when we desperately need them,

01:38.134 --> 01:40.669
and they help us
find our way to happiness.

01:40.753 --> 01:43.588
And when they die,
they're not really gone.

01:43.673 --> 01:46.091
They just... move on
to someone else.

01:47.510 --> 01:49.811
Where did you hear that?

01:49.846 --> 01:51.479
I don't know.

01:51.514 --> 01:53.982
It's-it's just a silly idea.

01:54.016 --> 01:55.901
I don't... I don't
believe it anymore.

01:55.985 --> 01:57.519
Anymore?

01:57.603 --> 02:00.355
Maybe you do need
some alone time.

02:00.439 --> 02:03.775
I'm gonna let you
grieve in peace.

02:03.860 --> 02:05.911
Did you ever find
my baby pictures?

02:05.995 --> 02:08.029
Oh, shoot, I forgot
to look for them.

02:08.114 --> 02:09.865
I'll-I'll... I'll go
do that right now.

02:09.916 --> 02:12.868
You don't have any.

02:12.952 --> 02:14.703
That's why I've never seen them.

02:14.787 --> 02:16.705
Why are you lying?

02:16.756 --> 02:19.507
Lying? Oh, honestly, Ryan.

02:21.043 --> 02:24.129
I know about The Flock
of the Grey Shepherd.

02:34.523 --> 02:36.391
There was a time

02:36.442 --> 02:39.861
when your father and I
were very happy together.

02:39.896 --> 02:41.563
So, what happened?

02:41.647 --> 02:44.032
Kristen.

02:44.066 --> 02:46.067
I mean, it's not her fault,

02:46.118 --> 02:48.236
but now we had a family,

02:48.321 --> 02:50.655
and he felt like he needed
to grow his practice,

02:50.740 --> 02:53.742
and he needed <i> me</i> to
be a lawyer's wife.

02:53.826 --> 02:58.296
I tried, but I never fit in.

02:58.381 --> 03:00.882
Henry and I started to fight.

03:00.917 --> 03:03.418
I was so miserable,
I just wanted out.

03:03.469 --> 03:05.837
So you joined a cult?

03:05.922 --> 03:09.257
It wasn't a cult, at least...
at least not at first.

03:09.342 --> 03:11.927
When I met Charles, he
was just this amazing man

03:11.978 --> 03:13.728
who listened to me.

03:13.763 --> 03:15.313
(crying):
He said

03:15.398 --> 03:18.600
he could help me find...

03:18.651 --> 03:21.770
unimaginable happiness.

03:24.023 --> 03:26.491
And I wanted that so badly.

03:27.860 --> 03:30.195
So I took Kristen,

03:30.279 --> 03:32.747
and we joined
Charles' community.

03:34.333 --> 03:37.285
(sighs heavily)

03:37.370 --> 03:40.171
We were there for three years.

03:42.875 --> 03:45.126
Three years?

03:46.929 --> 03:49.431
But how did you and Dad have me?

03:54.220 --> 03:56.604
Dad isn't my father.

03:56.639 --> 03:58.306
Jesus, Mom!

03:58.357 --> 04:00.725
I was in love.
I made a mistake.

04:00.810 --> 04:03.311
I-I-I'm crazy!
We all know this!

04:03.396 --> 04:05.814
(sniffles)

04:05.865 --> 04:08.316
Charles started to
have revelations.

04:08.367 --> 04:10.952
He said ancient
gods spoke to him.

04:10.987 --> 04:15.040
<i>He said a dog god would appear</i>
<i>to a Chosen One</i>

04:15.124 --> 04:16.825
<i>and would then lead him</i>
<i>to happiness,</i>

04:16.875 --> 04:19.293
<i>and then, that Chosen One</i>
<i>would be a prophet.</i>

04:19.327 --> 04:22.497
<i>He started having these bizarre</i>
<i>fertility rituals.</i>

04:22.581 --> 04:26.501
<i>We were all drunk on mescal</i>
<i>and dandelion wine.</i>

04:26.552 --> 04:29.971
<i>He called them</i>
<i>"feasts of carnality."</i>

04:30.006 --> 04:33.058
<i>And then, when you were born,</i>
<i>Charles said</i>

04:33.142 --> 04:35.093
<i>you were the one</i>
<i>we'd been waiting for.</i>

04:35.177 --> 04:36.845
<i>The Chosen One.</i>

04:36.929 --> 04:38.847
<i>He said you needed</i>
<i>to be protected,</i>

04:38.931 --> 04:41.850
<i>and he even started</i>
<i>to restrict my access to you.</i>

04:41.934 --> 04:44.602
<i>I was scared.</i>
<i>He wouldn't let us go.</i>

04:44.687 --> 04:46.521
<i>I wrote to Henry.</i>

04:46.605 --> 04:49.657
<i>He went to the police,</i>
<i>and Charles was arrested.</i>

04:49.692 --> 04:52.827
<i>The community was abandoned,</i>
<i>and Henry...</i>

04:52.862 --> 04:55.363
he insisted on adopting you.

04:55.414 --> 04:56.998
(sniffles)

04:57.033 --> 04:58.533
He even agreed to
represent Charles

04:58.584 --> 05:00.201
on his tax evasion charges

05:00.252 --> 05:03.505
if he'd renounce all
parental claims to you.

05:05.925 --> 05:08.009
Charles died in prison.

05:08.044 --> 05:12.263
Henry never wanted
you to know about him.

05:12.348 --> 05:15.383
He forgave me, but I...

05:15.468 --> 05:17.802
couldn't forgive myself.

05:17.887 --> 05:20.021
I had to go.

05:24.060 --> 05:26.361
Am I boring you?

05:26.395 --> 05:28.563
What?

05:28.647 --> 05:30.949
Um... no.

05:33.319 --> 05:37.572
Uh... I need to lie down.

05:37.623 --> 05:40.241
Do you hate me?
Of course not, Mom.

05:40.326 --> 05:42.460
I'm just glad I know the truth.

05:42.545 --> 05:44.079
Every mother

05:44.163 --> 05:46.164
thinks her son is special
but you really are.

05:46.248 --> 05:47.665
(sniffles)

05:47.750 --> 05:49.300
Even though
you're not a prophet.

05:49.385 --> 05:50.752
(laughs quietly)

05:50.836 --> 05:53.304
(Catherine sniffles)

06:07.770 --> 06:11.072
WILFRED (echoey):
<i>Hey, Ryan.</i>

06:11.107 --> 06:13.825
(sighs)

06:13.909 --> 06:15.944
Wilfred?

06:16.028 --> 06:18.196
(echoey):
Over here, mate.

06:20.866 --> 06:24.335
(laughs) You look like shit.

06:24.420 --> 06:26.671
We can talk later.

06:28.624 --> 06:30.792
(water gurgling) Wait.

06:30.876 --> 06:33.178
How...?

06:34.547 --> 06:35.964
What?

06:38.846 --> 06:41.386
(echoey):
Lights out, Ryan.

06:48.718 --> 06:51.053
(sighs)

06:51.120 --> 06:53.372
(bird singing)

06:59.495 --> 07:01.797
(sighs)

07:04.884 --> 07:06.668
(sighs)

07:10.173 --> 07:12.557
Good morning.

07:12.642 --> 07:13.713
Or should I say, good afternoon?

07:13.833 --> 07:15.033
That was quite a nap you took.

07:15.272 --> 07:17.896
But... you were dead.

07:17.980 --> 07:19.848
I-I thought
I'd never see you again.

07:19.899 --> 07:21.817
Yeah, 'cause you
thought all that stuff

07:21.851 --> 07:23.735
about me being a god
was a crock of shit.

07:23.820 --> 07:25.353
Now do you believe?

07:25.473 --> 07:27.711
You really are Mataman?
Well, I'm not

07:27.831 --> 07:29.482
Jesus Christ, and
as far as I know,

07:29.607 --> 07:30.990
he was the only other dude

07:31.075 --> 07:33.276
who managed to pull
off a resurrection.

07:33.360 --> 07:34.911
Speaking of god
tricks, check this out.

07:37.331 --> 07:38.665
Ah.

07:38.749 --> 07:40.283
(dove cooing)

07:40.334 --> 07:42.752
Like to see Jesus do that.

07:42.786 --> 07:44.120
So it's true.

07:44.204 --> 07:46.589
I'm the Chosen One.

07:47.477 --> 07:49.528
Which means I'm not crazy.

07:49.612 --> 07:50.643
It's all real!

07:50.763 --> 07:54.449
I'm not crazy, Wilf...
Ah, gross.

07:56.238 --> 07:57.722
I wasn't dead for long,

07:57.842 --> 08:00.217
barely enough time to
see a few old friends.

08:00.337 --> 08:01.926
Dennis, of course.

08:02.046 --> 08:03.336
I looked around for Jellybeans,

08:03.456 --> 08:05.266
but apparently, they already
sent him back as a dolphin,

08:05.386 --> 08:07.753
which, when you think about
it, totally makes sense.

08:07.873 --> 08:09.472
Ryan?

08:09.592 --> 08:12.417
So sorry about Wilfred.

08:13.753 --> 08:16.171
Thanks, Margot.

08:16.255 --> 08:18.507
(clicks her tongue)

08:18.591 --> 08:19.970
So, you're a ghost?

08:20.090 --> 08:22.041
Not exactly.

08:22.161 --> 08:23.937
I'm between host bodies.

08:24.057 --> 08:27.566
I need to move on to
my next Chosen One.

08:27.650 --> 08:28.887
His name is Nazeem,

08:29.007 --> 08:32.821
which should be, you
know, interesting.

08:32.855 --> 08:35.857
Anyway, Nazeem doesn't
bottom out till Thursday,

08:35.942 --> 08:38.610
so I thought I'd stop by
and do a victory lap.

08:38.693 --> 08:40.912
So, you came to bask
in the happiness

08:40.996 --> 08:42.197
that you brought me and Jenna?

08:42.229 --> 08:43.177
Exactly.

08:43.402 --> 08:44.612
Where is she, by the way?

08:44.732 --> 08:46.445
Wisconsin with Drew.

08:46.720 --> 08:49.069
Ah-ha. Good one. Seriously.

08:49.189 --> 08:51.923
Seriously. She dumped me.

08:52.008 --> 08:53.822
She can't do that to me!

08:53.942 --> 08:55.061
To you?

08:55.181 --> 08:58.832
Ryan, it was my godly duty
to lead you to happiness.

08:58.952 --> 09:00.103
She's screwed up everything!

09:00.184 --> 09:01.735
Don't be so hard on yourself.

09:01.819 --> 09:03.236
I don't think I'm
capable of being happy.

09:03.320 --> 09:05.355
Bullshit! I just...

09:05.439 --> 09:08.157
I just made a miscalculation
with Jenna.

09:08.277 --> 09:09.659
Ah, yeah, yeah. Ah.

09:09.694 --> 09:11.828
All right, okay.

09:11.862 --> 09:14.864
Happiness. Ryan.

09:14.949 --> 09:16.866
Come on, Mataman,
you can do this.

09:16.951 --> 09:18.668
(sighs)

09:18.703 --> 09:21.421
What would make Ryan happy?

09:21.505 --> 09:23.923
Got it.
Got what?

09:24.008 --> 09:26.710
Ryan, I'm gonna lead you
to happiness right now.

09:26.794 --> 09:28.545
Let's go get your car.

09:28.596 --> 09:29.963
We're driving to happiness?

09:30.047 --> 09:31.214
We've been driving for hours.

09:31.298 --> 09:32.966
We're close, mate.

09:33.050 --> 09:37.387
Happiness is very, very,
very close.

09:37.438 --> 09:38.938
(scoffs)

09:39.023 --> 09:41.057
What-What's that?
That derisive grunt?

09:41.108 --> 09:42.609
What-what does that mean?

09:42.693 --> 09:44.561
You're a god, right?

09:44.645 --> 09:46.479
Well, I did rise
from the dead, yeah.

09:46.564 --> 09:48.064
Well, then, I guess you
should know what that means.

09:48.115 --> 09:50.650
It doesn't work that way.
It doesn't work at all.

09:50.735 --> 09:52.235
I mean, if you're a god,

09:52.319 --> 09:53.737
why didn't you know the
truth about my father?

09:53.821 --> 09:55.321
You didn't even
know you <i> were</i> a god.

09:55.406 --> 09:56.740
Admit it, you have no
idea where we're going.

09:56.824 --> 09:59.909
Yes, I do.
I just can't tell you.

09:59.960 --> 10:02.045
Because you don't know.
Oh, I know!

10:02.079 --> 10:04.380
Bullshit!

10:06.133 --> 10:08.468
Something's not right.

10:08.552 --> 10:10.970
Ryan,

10:11.055 --> 10:12.756
you have to trust me.
If you want me

10:12.840 --> 10:15.001
to trust you, why won't you
tell me where we're going?!

10:15.059 --> 10:16.726
It's called dramatic effect!

10:16.761 --> 10:18.094
Seriously?!

10:18.145 --> 10:19.679
I've had enough of this shit!

10:19.764 --> 10:21.931
Tell me right now--
where are we going?

10:25.936 --> 10:28.238
We're here.

10:33.944 --> 10:36.162
I know this place.

10:46.707 --> 10:48.925
Look familiar, mate?

10:53.013 --> 10:56.432
Wilfred... what's inside?

11:32.503 --> 11:35.088
MAN:
Stop right there.

11:35.172 --> 11:38.725
Turn around then, nice and slow.

11:46.934 --> 11:49.352
Uh...

11:49.436 --> 11:53.106
my-my car broke down,
and my-my cell phone's dead,

11:53.190 --> 11:55.658
so I was just...
looking for a phone.

12:09.673 --> 12:11.624
Sorry about the shotgun.

12:11.709 --> 12:14.210
This far out of town,
you can't be too careful.

12:14.295 --> 12:15.762
I understand.

12:17.715 --> 12:19.355
I'll just use your phone
and be on my way.

12:19.383 --> 12:20.800
Okay, then.

12:20.885 --> 12:23.219
Come on, Krunny.

12:23.304 --> 12:25.104
Let's give the man some privacy.

12:34.732 --> 12:38.568
Yeah. Hi, is this the auto club?

12:38.619 --> 12:41.537
Yeah, my car broke down
on route...

13:05.933 --> 13:13.829
Hello, Ryan,
I always hoped you'd come looking for me.

13:15.381 --> 13:17.586
You know, that was
the first baby picture

13:17.706 --> 13:19.634
of myself I'd ever seen.

13:20.739 --> 13:22.798
Well, I got a few more
I can show you.

13:24.473 --> 13:26.725
(keys jingling)

13:29.146 --> 13:31.313
That's my mom.
And Kristen.

13:31.397 --> 13:33.398
When I first met her, she was so

13:33.449 --> 13:35.567
deeply unhappy.

13:35.651 --> 13:37.535
I wanted to save her.

13:39.905 --> 13:41.906
These were some of
the community elders.

13:41.991 --> 13:43.408
The Native
American guy--

13:43.459 --> 13:44.826
that's Bill.

13:44.910 --> 13:47.212
Grew the best weed
in California.

13:47.246 --> 13:48.913
And, uh, Theo.

13:48.965 --> 13:51.049
He was our historian,

13:51.083 --> 13:53.969
took most of the pictures
you see in this book.

13:54.053 --> 13:56.171
And Evan--

13:56.255 --> 13:59.007
he was our liaison
with the outside world.

14:02.762 --> 14:04.763
Bruce?

14:04.814 --> 14:07.482
No, that's Shane.

14:07.566 --> 14:09.818
He always played
the evil god in our rituals.

14:09.902 --> 14:11.736
Krungel.

14:13.356 --> 14:15.190
Right.

14:15.274 --> 14:17.275
He always was a troublemaker
and he still is.

14:17.360 --> 14:19.744
He's been putting the
squeeze on your dad,

14:19.779 --> 14:20.862
threatening to tell you

14:20.946 --> 14:22.447
all about me

14:22.498 --> 14:24.366
if your dad doesn't
keep paying him off.

14:24.450 --> 14:27.952
That cat is finally
out of the bag.

14:35.378 --> 14:38.096
Who is that guy?

14:38.130 --> 14:39.681
That's Richard.

14:39.765 --> 14:42.467
He always played
the good god, Mataman.

14:42.551 --> 14:45.270
A real prick.

14:45.304 --> 14:47.389
Nobody liked him.
Very preachy,

14:47.473 --> 14:49.691
always telling other people
how to live their lives.

14:55.147 --> 14:58.116
That's you and me?

14:58.150 --> 14:59.651
When I signed the papers

14:59.735 --> 15:02.871
giving up all rights to you,

15:02.955 --> 15:05.490
I asked your dad if I could
see you one last time.

15:06.959 --> 15:08.877
That's it.

15:08.961 --> 15:10.912
Your dad...

15:10.996 --> 15:14.799
is a good, good man.

15:14.834 --> 15:18.002
He was killed in a car accident.

15:18.087 --> 15:20.555
Oh, I'm so sorry.

15:20.639 --> 15:24.976
I didn't even know about you
until this morning.

15:25.010 --> 15:28.596
My mom said you died in prison.

15:28.681 --> 15:31.566
That's what I wanted
Henry to tell her.

15:31.650 --> 15:35.437
I figured if she
thought I was dead,

15:35.521 --> 15:38.022
she'd really get on
with her life.

15:38.107 --> 15:41.025
I didn't want her
clinging to some

15:41.110 --> 15:43.778
fantasy love affair
with some crazy man.

15:43.863 --> 15:46.581
You don't seem crazy.

15:46.665 --> 15:48.917
(soft chuckle) Son...

15:49.001 --> 15:51.169
I'm all kinds of nuts.

15:51.203 --> 15:54.038
The only thing that keeps me
from bouncing off padded walls

15:54.123 --> 15:56.875
is... I've discovered
the one, true god.

15:58.878 --> 16:02.213
And I take half a dozen
pharmaceuticals.

16:02.298 --> 16:05.717
These days
the craziest thing I do

16:05.768 --> 16:09.354
is talk to my dog.

16:09.388 --> 16:12.223
Does he ever talk back?

16:13.392 --> 16:15.059
Not for a long, long time.

16:15.144 --> 16:17.228
And for that, I am grateful.

16:17.313 --> 16:20.398
So...

16:20.449 --> 16:22.784
The Flock of the Grey Shepherd?

16:22.868 --> 16:24.369
(sighs)

16:24.403 --> 16:26.371
I wasn't trying to fool anybody.

16:26.405 --> 16:30.492
I believed all that
crazy shit I was saying.

16:30.576 --> 16:33.044
Your mom did me a favor
by getting Henry involved.

16:33.078 --> 16:34.963
He saved me from myself.

16:39.051 --> 16:41.052
So...

16:41.086 --> 16:44.472
I'm not the Chosen One?

16:44.557 --> 16:46.724
CHARLES:
<i>There is no Chosen One.</i>

16:46.759 --> 16:48.726
<i>There's no dog god.</i>

16:48.761 --> 16:51.513
<i>I just made all that up.</i>

16:51.597 --> 16:55.850
<i>All just the insane creation</i>
<i>of a very sick mind.</i>

16:55.935 --> 16:59.521
(Ryan and Wilfred laughing)

16:59.605 --> 17:01.940
(indistinct, speedy chatter)

17:02.024 --> 17:04.358
(distorted laugh)

17:08.280 --> 17:11.833
(distorted): What... Is
this your shock collar?

17:13.285 --> 17:14.953
(buzzing) Aah!

17:15.037 --> 17:16.037
Wilfred, stop.

17:16.121 --> 17:19.174
(gurgling)

17:19.258 --> 17:20.340
(panting)

17:20.425 --> 17:22.010
Goddamn it, Wilfred.

17:24.380 --> 17:25.463
WILFRED:
Well?

17:25.548 --> 17:27.098
Get away from me.

17:27.132 --> 17:29.267
Okay, you're upset.
You want to tell me why?

17:29.301 --> 17:30.969
You're not real.
None of this is real.

17:31.020 --> 17:32.804
That's ridiculous.
Can you hear yourself talking?

17:32.888 --> 17:34.689
Just stay the hell away from me.

17:34.773 --> 17:36.891
Well, you can't
just leave me here.

17:36.976 --> 17:38.810
Ryan.

17:38.861 --> 17:40.695
Ryan!

17:42.815 --> 17:44.282
Ryan.

17:44.316 --> 17:46.150
Wait.

17:46.202 --> 17:47.318
Let's talk about this.

17:47.369 --> 17:48.820
Ryan!

17:48.871 --> 17:50.738
Ryan!

17:58.464 --> 18:00.011
WILFRED:
You little shit.

18:01.968 --> 18:04.469
It took me all
night to walk home.

18:04.520 --> 18:06.771
My pads are bloody stumps.

18:06.806 --> 18:09.307
Oh, what, you're
gonna ignore me, now?

18:09.392 --> 18:11.226
Really?

18:12.367 --> 18:15.230
You gonna ignore this?

18:15.314 --> 18:17.816
He's not real.
He's not real.

18:17.867 --> 18:21.319
(engine starts)
He's not real. He's not real.

18:24.373 --> 18:26.208
Shit.

18:28.461 --> 18:30.045
Morning, Ryan.

18:39.839 --> 18:42.557
WILFRED:
Excuse me, miss?

18:42.642 --> 18:44.426
Miss?

18:44.510 --> 18:47.512
I-I've been waiting here
patiently for about a week now.

18:47.563 --> 18:49.097
I'm here to see Ryan Newman.

18:49.181 --> 18:50.765
I just need five
minutes of his time.

18:50.850 --> 18:53.652
Okay, okay, I'll wait.

19:01.110 --> 19:02.944
Ryan.

19:03.029 --> 19:05.196
Please.

19:07.250 --> 19:11.419
Ryan! It's me,

19:11.504 --> 19:13.038
Wilfred!

19:13.122 --> 19:14.539
Ryan!

19:14.624 --> 19:17.542
Ryan! Ryan!

19:17.593 --> 19:19.461
Ryan!

19:27.053 --> 19:28.386
KRISTEN:
Ryan?

19:28.437 --> 19:31.273
Sorry. You were saying?

19:31.357 --> 19:33.525
Things are going really
well for me at the clinic.

19:33.559 --> 19:36.478
It's weird, I spent years
bringing babies into this world

19:36.562 --> 19:39.114
and I was miserable, and
now that I'm doing...

19:39.198 --> 19:42.233
you know, the opposite,
it's really fulfilling.

19:42.285 --> 19:44.119
That is weird.

19:44.203 --> 19:45.843
What I'm saying is,
I know how tough it is

19:45.871 --> 19:47.238
to be a single mom.

19:47.290 --> 19:48.873
And even though I'm great at it,

19:48.908 --> 19:50.625
it's not the right
choice for everyone.

19:50.710 --> 19:52.460
I'm helping these women

19:52.545 --> 19:54.963
at the most difficult
time in their lives.

19:55.047 --> 19:57.415
Well, that does sound rewarding.
It is.

19:57.466 --> 19:59.301
These women need me.

19:59.385 --> 20:01.219
Because, you know,

20:01.253 --> 20:03.505
not everybody is lucky enough
to have a brother like you

20:03.589 --> 20:05.029
to help them get
their shit together.

20:06.842 --> 20:09.978
Thank you.

20:10.062 --> 20:12.597
I'm glad you're happy.

20:12.648 --> 20:14.349
I wish you were.

20:14.433 --> 20:15.684
I'm okay.
Yeah?

20:15.768 --> 20:17.268
I mean, I'm not unhappy.

20:17.320 --> 20:19.604
I'm just... normal.

20:19.689 --> 20:20.905
That's not good enough, Ryan.

20:20.940 --> 20:23.358
Everybody deserves happiness.

20:23.442 --> 20:25.076
What would make you happy?

20:35.087 --> 20:37.122
Excuse me.

20:37.173 --> 20:38.923
(laughs):
Where are you going?

20:47.266 --> 20:49.100
Wilfred?

20:50.803 --> 20:52.137
Wilfred.

21:08.988 --> 21:11.623
I miss you, Wilfred.

21:11.657 --> 21:14.492
Without you,
my life is so ordinary

21:14.543 --> 21:18.163
and flat and dull.

21:18.247 --> 21:20.832
I need to know
that you're still here.

21:20.883 --> 21:22.634
Please, just give me a sign

21:22.668 --> 21:24.169
to let me know that...

21:24.220 --> 21:25.720
(sniffs)

21:25.805 --> 21:28.089
Oh, God.

21:28.174 --> 21:29.841
Wilfred.

21:29.925 --> 21:31.643
That'd be right, blame the dog.

21:31.677 --> 21:33.678
Oh, thank God.

21:33.729 --> 21:35.513
Ever since you've been gone

21:35.564 --> 21:37.265
I-I feel like I've been
holding my breath.

21:37.349 --> 21:39.184
Well, if that trouser
cough is any indication,

21:39.268 --> 21:40.685
I can understand why.

21:40.736 --> 21:42.103
You know that's all you, right?

21:42.188 --> 21:44.689
I do now.

21:44.740 --> 21:48.076
Wilfred, I want you
to stay, but...

21:48.160 --> 21:50.662
we can't go back to the way things were.
You mean,

21:50.696 --> 21:52.997
I tell you the right
thing to do, you ignore me,

21:53.032 --> 21:55.333
so I make your life a living
hell until you have no choice

21:55.367 --> 21:57.619
but to do the thing I told you
to do in the first place?

21:59.288 --> 22:01.005
Basically, yeah.

22:01.040 --> 22:03.458
Maybe you could pay attention
to the wisdom

22:03.542 --> 22:05.093
your best mate has to offer.

22:05.177 --> 22:07.762
Okay. And maybe, sometimes,

22:07.847 --> 22:09.681
if I need you to lay low...

22:09.715 --> 22:11.800
More nap time for me,
I'm not gonna argue with that.

22:17.723 --> 22:19.974
Man, I'm busting for a
piss. I haven't had a walk

22:20.059 --> 22:22.477
for, like, five weeks.
Would you mind if...

22:22.561 --> 22:24.881
Okay. Let me grab a sweatshirt.
Grab your sweatshirt, yeah.

22:41.714 --> 22:43.548
Huh.

22:47.887 --> 22:49.754
So, where do you go
when you're not around?

22:49.805 --> 22:52.590
I just hang out in your head.

22:52.675 --> 22:55.727
You know, sometimes I'll
check out your hippocampus,

22:55.761 --> 22:57.345
see what I can find.

22:57.429 --> 23:00.815
Uh, for example, I just
across that incident

23:00.900 --> 23:02.600
when you walked in
on your Uncle Larry.

23:02.651 --> 23:04.936
Yikes.
What incident?

23:05.020 --> 23:07.021
You know, when you were
six and you walked in

23:07.106 --> 23:08.773
and he turned around,
but it was too late

23:08.858 --> 23:10.441
because he was already there.

23:10.526 --> 23:11.943
Already where?

23:12.027 --> 23:13.611
There.

23:13.696 --> 23:15.113
Oh, shit.

23:15.164 --> 23:17.115
You repressed that.

23:17.166 --> 23:18.750
My bad. Whoops.

23:18.784 --> 23:20.168
Wait, what are you
talking about?

23:20.252 --> 23:22.036
Oh, nothing, I just
made all that up.

23:26.675 --> 23:28.293
Oh, God.

23:28.377 --> 23:30.962
Sorry, mate, I can't put that
one back where I found it.

23:33.094 --> 23:35.550
Ugh...

23:35.634 --> 23:37.602
So my iPod wasn't stolen?

23:37.636 --> 23:39.521
Nope, nope.
You set it down

23:39.605 --> 23:41.556
on the men's room counter

23:41.640 --> 23:43.525
at The Bungalow when you were
washing your hands

23:43.609 --> 23:45.777
and you just forgot about it.

23:45.811 --> 23:47.979
I-I just left it there?
I don't remember doing that.

23:48.063 --> 23:50.315
You may not remember it,
but that's what happened.

23:50.366 --> 23:53.368
Trust me. It's all in there.

23:53.452 --> 23:55.486
Huh.

23:55.538 --> 23:57.622
Who did I loan my
Polanski box set to?

23:57.656 --> 23:59.741
Jamie Fowler.
Jamie Fowler.

23:59.825 --> 24:02.994
Of course.

24:04.580 --> 24:06.497
What's that?

24:06.549 --> 24:10.168
I think that's a question
you can answer for yourself.
