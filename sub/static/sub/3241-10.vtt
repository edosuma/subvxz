Aye, lad, there is.

03:28.840 --> 03:32.367
The Duke of Sandringham has arrived
to take counsel with the laird.

Some would say too much so.

I'm not about to offer up my hindquarters.

But His Grace wields
a fair amount of power in court,

03:50.600 --> 03:53.285
and if so inclined,
he could lift the price on my head.

03:53.360 --> 03:54.930
Aye, it's worth the asking.

03:55.440 --> 03:58.205
Though he's not a man
to grant a favor lightly.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.567
It's not a favor I'm asking.

04:00.640 --> 04:01.971

04:07.080 --> 04:08.127
I've heard it before.

04:09.560 --> 04:13.042
Jamie, if I tell you something,
do you promise not to ask how I know?

04:13.560 --> 04:16.564
I told ye I'd never ask you for
anything ye dinna wish to tell me.

04:16.640 --> 04:18.404
Yes, I promise.

04:19.040 --> 04:21.088
The Duke, you mustn't trust him.

04:22.160 --> 04:25.323
You mean his fondness for other men?
I ken all about that.

04:25.400 --> 04:27.448
He visited here when I was 16 or so.

04:27.520 --> 04:30.729
Very attentive to me he was,
but that's as far as it went.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.287
(SIGHS)

04:35.360 --> 04:38.045
The Duke is a close ally
of Black Jack Randall.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.085
Did Randall tell ye that?

04:42.320 --> 04:44.288
- You promised.
- I made no such pledge.

04:44.360 --> 04:47.409
We'll both be respecting yer wishes
on that account.

04:50.640 --> 04:52.927
A friend of Jack Randall's
can be no friend of yours.

04:56.800 --> 05:00.521
Perhaps, before you approach the Duke,

05:00.600 --> 05:02.841
it might be worth having a word
with Ned Gowan.

05:03.320 --> 05:06.005
Get his advice in light of this information.

05:06.080 --> 05:07.241
Aye.

05:07.680 --> 05:09.409
I'll talk to the lawyer.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.365
But, Claire,

05:13.600 --> 05:15.443
ye must realize what this means.

05:16.040 --> 05:20.523
This is my first real opportunity
to gain a pardon.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.602
I can finally return home to Lallybroch.

05:23.280 --> 05:26.921
Take my rightful place
as laird of Broch Tuarach.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.843
And you can be my lady.

05:30.920 --> 05:33.810
We'd be happy there, I know we would.

05:38.560 --> 05:40.085
As do I.

05:42.520 --> 05:46.650
Look, laddie, as it stands now,
ye're wanted for murder.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.362
Ye can deny this from now till Judgment Day,

05:49.800 --> 05:52.485
but it's yer word against Captain Randall.

05:52.840 --> 05:54.683
And even with the Duke's backing,

05:54.760 --> 05:58.082
I fear that there is no
way that a British judge

05:58.160 --> 06:01.562
will take yer word over that of
one of His Majesty's officers.

06:02.240 --> 06:03.605
Even if my words speak the truth?

06:03.680 --> 06:06.923

have very little to do with the law.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.571
Hmm.

06:09.680 --> 06:10.761
Then there's nothing to be done.

06:10.840 --> 06:14.640
No, no, no, no, no. Don't be
so quick to surrender yer position.

06:15.720 --> 06:20.009
You tell me the Duke has
close ties to Black Jack?

06:21.000 --> 06:23.810
Well, if that's true,
we may be able to prove to the Duke

06:23.880 --> 06:28.283
that friendship with such a villain
is more dangerous than it's worth.

06:30.920 --> 06:34.129
If ye have something on yer mind,
Ned Gowan, then speak it.

06:35.040 --> 06:37.281
I can draw up a petition of complaint,

06:37.360 --> 06:41.126
accusing Randall of crimes
against the Scottish people,

06:41.200 --> 06:42.531
yer wife included,

06:42.600 --> 06:45.206
and of transgressing His Majesty's laws.

If you can convince the Duke of Sandringham

06:48.400 --> 06:49.811
to deliver that document

06:49.880 --> 06:52.884
to the Lord President
of the Court of Session,

06:52.960 --> 06:56.567
that could lead to a court martial
for Black Jack.

06:56.640 --> 07:00.725
Or at the very least, a reassignment
far from Scottish soil.

07:00.800 --> 07:03.087
Court martial? Reassignment?

Sweating out the rest of his military
career in some West Indies hellhole

07:08.560 --> 07:10.050
would be a far greater punishment.

07:10.640 --> 07:14.167

I can take Jamie's case to court

is denied, it can be very hurtful,

34:11.199 --> 34:13.123
Well, know it we do.

34:13.199 --> 34:15.248
And I have no doubt it's whispered about

34:15.320 --> 34:17.049
in Your Majesty's court as well.

34:17.120 --> 34:20.647
Our Majesty's court, you mean, of course.

34:21.320 --> 34:22.367
Leave us, Minou.

34:22.920 --> 34:24.126
Leave.

34:27.679 --> 34:29.444
Damn that Randall!

34:30.760 --> 34:33.445
I must admit that shielding him

34:33.520 --> 34:36.649
from the consequences of his misdeeds

34:36.760 --> 34:38.808
sometimes feels like a full-time occupation.

34:38.880 --> 34:41.201
And I loathe work.

34:41.880 --> 34:45.202
But it will require a good deal of delicacy.

34:45.280 --> 34:48.362
After all, I must damn the Captain
without damning myself.

34:49.320 --> 34:50.560
Of course.

34:52.280 --> 34:53.645
It could be done.

34:54.159 --> 34:56.606
However, Jamie,

34:56.679 --> 35:00.048
favors must be returned in kind.

35:00.160 --> 35:01.924
If I scrub your back,

35:02.000 --> 35:05.971
I'd expect you to see
that mine was equally spotless.

35:07.720 --> 35:09.802
I've been challenged to a duel.

35:10.760 --> 35:11.966
By the MacDonalds, you mean?

35:12.080 --> 35:14.208
Ah, you saw them leave the house, yes?

35:14.280 --> 35:15.930
Andrew MacDonald.

35:16.520 --> 35:19.842
Some nonsense about an unpaid debt.

35:20.720 --> 35:23.087

turn my back on a game of maw.

35:23.160 --> 35:24.321
Pity I'm not better at it.

35:25.080 --> 35:28.687
Anyway, this is an affair of honor.

35:28.760 --> 35:32.401
Shots will be exchanged,
but I understand no one will be hurt.

35:32.480 --> 35:33.561
MURTAGH: Hmm.

35:33.640 --> 35:35.483
When the MacDonalds are involved,

35:35.560 --> 35:37.801
there's always a chance
that blood will be spilt.

35:37.880 --> 35:40.690
Yes, I know the MacDonalds
and MacKenzies are sworn enemies,

35:40.760 --> 35:43.001
but this is not a clan matter.

35:43.080 --> 35:45.401
I myself will be in the line of fire.

35:45.480 --> 35:49.724
All that I require from Jamie
is that he appears as my second.

35:50.440 --> 35:52.841
Alas, my servants are chosen
for their beauty,

35:52.960 --> 35:55.964
not their belligerence.

35:56.040 --> 35:58.964
You, of course, contain within you

36:00.240 --> 36:02.811
a sublime combination of the two.

36:06.480 --> 36:09.131
This is no good, Jamie.
This is a MacDonald matter.

36:09.200 --> 36:10.486
You need to stay out of it.

36:10.560 --> 36:12.722
You suggested I approach Sandringham
in the first place.

36:12.800 --> 36:15.485
I'd have kept my mouth shut if I knew
he'd lead ye to the MacDonalds.

36:15.560 --> 36:17.403
I'm not feeling blithe about it myself,

36:17.480 --> 36:19.482
but if I back out now,

36:19.560 --> 36:22.370
I lose my chance
to return to Lallybroch a free man.

36:22.440 --> 36:24.807
There will be other chances.

36:24.880 --> 36:28.327
Can you swear to it?
Better than the one afore me?

36:31.480 --> 36:32.641
Well, it's a risk I have to take.

50:48.160 --> 50:49.321
Aye.

50:50.200 --> 50:52.771
There'll be no one to save her
from Colum's ire.

50:55.480 --> 50:56.641
Stay away from her, Claire.

50:57.280 --> 50:58.850
DOUGAL: Kiss your bride goodbye, Jamie.

50:59.520 --> 51:01.284
The others await us.

51:01.360 --> 51:04.842
I want to put some hard miles between
me and my brother before nightfall.

51:09.040 --> 51:11.805
These are dangerous times,
<i>mo nighean donn.</i>

51:11.920 --> 51:12.967
Be careful.

51:13.040 --> 51:14.804
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

51:14.880 --> 51:16.166
I will.

51:27.600 --> 51:29.841
I said kiss her, dinna swallow her.

51:42.080 --> 51:44.401
Come back to me, James Fraser.

51:49.440 --> 51:51.204
As soon as I can.

52:32.320 --> 52:33.526
(SOFT GRUNT)

52:33.600 --> 52:37.047
I'm sorry, my dear.
Didn't mean to bother you.

52:37.120 --> 52:39.043
Thought a wee bit of salve might help.

52:40.920 --> 52:42.809
It's no bother.

52:42.880 --> 52:44.928
I do wish you'd take more care
around the ovens.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.286
That's the second burn this week.

52:46.360 --> 52:48.840
I'd call that a very good week.

52:52.960 --> 52:54.530
Ooh, now.

52:55.800 --> 52:57.723
Dinna fash yerself,

52:57.800 --> 53:00.371
it's not a permanent situation, ye ken.

53:01.240 --> 53:03.891
Jamie will appease his laird best he can

53:03.960 --> 53:07.442
and be back in his good graces in no time.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.128
In your arms, as well.

53:12.560 --> 53:14.050
(LAUGHING)

53:15.040 --> 53:16.610
Thank you, Mrs. Fitz.

53:17.080 --> 53:18.241
TAMMAS: Auntie.

53:18.320 --> 53:19.606
Madam Fraser.

53:20.160 --> 53:22.606
A letter has arrived for you, madam,

53:23.520 --> 53:25.284
from the village.

53:36.640 --> 53:37.641
Hah.

53:52.560 --> 53:55.245
Geillis, I came as quickly as I could.

53:55.320 --> 53:56.367
Claire.

53:58.080 --> 54:00.048
- Your letter.
- What letter?

54:01.240 --> 54:02.685
The one you sent.

54:06.880 --> 54:08.689
'Twas not me who sent it.

54:09.160 --> 54:11.970
Suspect someone's playing a prank
on you, Claire.

54:12.040 --> 54:14.281
I was just about to go downstairs to dinner.

54:14.360 --> 54:17.011
Jeanie, ye can set the table for two.

54:17.080 --> 54:18.809
Geillis, this is no prank.

54:18.880 --> 54:20.484
I've no time for dinner and neither do you.

54:20.560 --> 54:22.050
You must leave here now.

54:22.840 --> 54:25.161
Leave? And go where?

54:25.280 --> 54:26.725
Wherever you choose. I don't care.

54:26.840 --> 54:28.285
Well, that's a comfort.

54:28.600 --> 54:31.604
In that case, I'll remain here.

54:33.800 --> 54:36.167
Geillis, drop the pretense.

54:36.240 --> 54:39.130
I know you poisoned your husband
and I'm not the only one.

54:39.640 --> 54:41.642
What a thing to say, Claire.

54:42.640 --> 54:44.404
It's positively cruel.

54:45.480 --> 54:47.005
Not as cruel as Colum will be.

54:48.200 --> 54:50.487
If you care for your baby,

54:50.560 --> 54:53.166
then you will pack some belongings
and you will flee here.

54:53.240 --> 54:55.402
We can argue the "why" of it later.

54:56.760 --> 54:59.604
Your concern touches my heart,
but it's misplaced.

55:05.720 --> 55:06.721
(SNIFFS)

55:07.360 --> 55:08.361

- WARDEN: Open the door now!

55:13.320 --> 55:14.685
It's the warden.

55:16.840 --> 55:18.046
Mistress?

55:18.120 --> 55:19.565
There are wardens here to see ye!

55:19.640 --> 55:20.766
WARDEN: Open this door now!

55:21.600 --> 55:24.126
Do not let her answer that door.

55:24.200 --> 55:26.680
You can escape through the kitchen.
I'll see to the packing.

55:26.800 --> 55:28.290
I'll meet you in the glade later tonight.

55:28.360 --> 55:31.330
Flee my own house?
Like a thief in the night?

55:31.400 --> 55:33.448
- I won't have it.
- WARDEN: Open this door now!

55:34.280 --> 55:35.486
WARDEN 2: This is official business!

55:35.600 --> 55:38.285
We demand to see Mistress Duncan
right away.

55:39.240 --> 55:40.890
- Open up!
- Mistress!

55:41.680 --> 55:44.206
Dougal will never allow
anything to happen to me.

55:46.720 --> 55:48.165
To us.

55:51.320 --> 55:52.890
Jeanie!

55:52.960 --> 55:54.121
Let them in!

55:55.080 --> 55:56.809
WARDEN 1: Geillis Duncan!

55:59.640 --> 56:00.641
He made me a promise.

56:00.720 --> 56:01.721
WARDEN 1: Take us to your mistress.

56:01.800 --> 56:03.802
The man loves me to death.

56:04.640 --> 56:07.769
Geillis Duncan,
ye're under arrest for witchcraft.

56:09.880 --> 56:12.281
- Under whose orders?
- Well, lookie here.

56:12.360 --> 56:14.010
The other sorceress.

56:14.080 --> 56:15.411
It's the thieves' hole for the both of ye.

56:15.480 --> 56:17.050
What on earth have I done?

56:17.120 --> 56:18.690
You'll hear all about it at the trial.

56:24.080 --> 56:25.127
Let's go.

56:26.240 --> 56:28.163
Get your hands off me!

56:29.200 --> 56:30.884
Stop! Get off me!

56:31.800 --> 56:34.531
Ye'll not be casting any spells on us tonight.

56:35.520 --> 56:38.205
Aye, ye're a feisty little witch,
I'll give ye that.
