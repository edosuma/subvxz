WEBVTT

00:13.828 --> 00:15.057
Here. Thanks, man.

00:15.230 --> 00:16.959
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.

00:27.475 --> 00:28.567
Don't move.

00:31.646 --> 00:33.114
Drive.

00:41.690 --> 00:43.488
What's this about?

00:44.492 --> 00:46.586
Tell us where the money is.

00:47.862 --> 00:49.660
I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:53.935 --> 00:55.562
Get off the main street.

00:57.038 --> 00:58.062
Turn here.

01:03.979 --> 01:05.447
I'll ask again.

01:06.181 --> 01:07.808
Where did you put the money?

02:27.829 --> 02:29.661
- Deeks, what are you doing?
- Agh!

02:30.965 --> 02:31.989
I'm straightening her.

02:32.167 --> 02:33.191
- Straightening?
- Yup.

02:33.368 --> 02:34.665
She's late.

02:34.836 --> 02:36.634
The 405's probably jammed.

02:36.805 --> 02:38.671
The 405 is always jammed. It's L.A.

02:39.941 --> 02:43.377
- You talk to her?
- Yeah. No, I called her to say hi.

02:43.545 --> 02:45.206
Mm-hm. How'd she sound?

02:45.380 --> 02:48.350
You know, irritated and annoyed.

02:48.516 --> 02:50.541
Well, what do you expect?
She was talking to you.

02:50.718 --> 02:53.278
- Sounds like she's back to me.
- Shes.

02:53.455 --> 02:55.014
- Hey.
- Kensi.

02:55.190 --> 02:56.351
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:56.524 --> 02:58.253
Oh, I got you a coffee. Sorry.

02:58.426 --> 03:01.726
A double espresso with almond milk
and two packets of...

03:01.896 --> 03:04.126
You already got a coffee.

03:04.299 --> 03:06.199
I do. Thanks.

03:06.367 --> 03:07.857
- How are you?
- Good.

03:08.036 --> 03:09.731
- Yeah?
- Really good.

03:09.904 --> 03:11.303
You look good.

03:11.806 --> 03:15.401
I mean that you seem good
by the way that you look.

03:15.944 --> 03:17.070
That's because I am good.

03:17.245 --> 03:18.269
- Good.
- Good.

03:18.446 --> 03:19.845
Good.

03:22.951 --> 03:25.716
Kensi, looking good.

03:26.287 --> 03:28.585
Back just in time.
We've got a case, guys.

03:33.094 --> 03:34.289
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

03:34.462 --> 03:37.227
- Welcome back.
- Yeah.

03:49.711 --> 03:51.338
Hey, Nell.

03:51.513 --> 03:52.912
Kens.

03:54.716 --> 03:57.151
And here's
your welcome home prize.

03:57.318 --> 04:00.288
Nell, why don't we tell her
what she's won.

04:00.455 --> 04:03.857
Adrian Davis was a contractor
and former Marine in Iraq.

04:04.025 --> 04:07.825
He later set up a security company
with his partner, Gabriel Stanfill.

04:07.996 --> 04:09.521
They had some major contracts,

04:09.697 --> 04:11.688
and Adrian was their point person
in Baghdad.

04:11.866 --> 04:14.358
And like some
of the less reputable contractors,

04:14.536 --> 04:16.527
embezzled
from the restoration funds.

04:16.704 --> 04:18.762
Our government still can't account
for billions.

04:18.940 --> 04:20.635
Six-point-five, to be exact.

04:20.808 --> 04:23.778
And Davis was caught trying
to smuggle a million dollars

04:23.945 --> 04:25.913
back to the States. For the record,

04:26.080 --> 04:29.516
that is what a million in shrink-wrapped
$100 bills looks like.

04:29.684 --> 04:31.550
Davis did seven years in Lompoc.

04:31.719 --> 04:32.982
He was just released last week.

04:33.154 --> 04:35.816
Last night,
his car was found totaled.

04:35.990 --> 04:39.893
No trace of Davis but there was
a dead guy in the passenger seat.

04:40.061 --> 04:41.893
His name is Areeb Sahar.

04:42.063 --> 04:43.895
He's a known al Qaeda sympathizer.

04:44.065 --> 04:45.533
And ten minutes earlier,

04:45.700 --> 04:49.694
a security camera found him
in the valet lot of a nearby restaurant

04:49.871 --> 04:52.340
talking to this man, Mazhar Tarik.

04:52.507 --> 04:55.568
Tarik is also
a known al Qaeda sympathizer.

04:55.743 --> 04:59.873
So we believe that both of these men
were after the money Davis stole.

05:00.048 --> 05:02.574
Weren't the funds confiscated
when Davis was arrested?

05:02.750 --> 05:05.617
- They were.
- Then why go after Davis?

05:05.787 --> 05:07.482
Because they think
that there's more.

05:07.655 --> 05:08.747
A lot more.

05:08.923 --> 05:10.763
Al Qaeda would never put
an operation in motion

05:10.925 --> 05:12.965
unless there was something there.
So Davis gets out.

05:13.094 --> 05:15.620
They think he's sitting on millions
that he stole from them.

05:15.797 --> 05:18.698
Vendetta and windfall,
perfect storm.

05:18.866 --> 05:20.561
What about, uh, Davis' partner?

05:20.735 --> 05:22.169
Stanfill? He was never charged.

05:22.337 --> 05:25.602
He folded the contracting company
after Adrian Davis was arrested.

05:25.773 --> 05:29.903
And he currently owns a wholesale
wine distributorship in L.A.

05:30.078 --> 05:31.238
We think he was part of this?

05:31.379 --> 05:33.711
No, they could never tie him
to the embezzlement.

05:33.881 --> 05:35.246
Uh, he's squeaky clean.

05:35.416 --> 05:37.908
Davis is single.
He's got a house in the Valley.

05:38.086 --> 05:40.316
All right. Sam,
let's check out Davis' place, huh?

05:40.488 --> 05:41.512
Let's do it.

05:41.689 --> 05:45.523
Great. Me and my, uh, partner
over here, we'll go check out Stanfill.

05:46.094 --> 05:47.892
Yeah, about that. Um...

05:48.062 --> 05:51.293
Hetty would like to speak
with you both first.

05:51.833 --> 05:53.767
- She wants to...
- Why... Okay.

05:58.339 --> 06:03.243
I'd like to join everyone here
in welcoming you home.

06:03.411 --> 06:05.038
Thank you.

06:06.848 --> 06:08.213
At first,

06:08.383 --> 06:11.216
I want you to stay back.

06:11.386 --> 06:14.321
Get your bearings.
You've been through a lot.

06:15.890 --> 06:17.654
Stay back where? Why?

06:17.825 --> 06:18.917
Up in Ops.

06:19.794 --> 06:21.284
Ops?

06:21.462 --> 06:24.830
- I mean, Hetty, do you really think...?
- Oh, yes, I do.

06:26.501 --> 06:29.129
Okay, well, partner,
I guess you're on your own again.

06:29.304 --> 06:31.830
Well, not exactly.

06:32.006 --> 06:37.968
Miss Jones has worked
with Mr. Deeks in your absence.

06:38.146 --> 06:41.446
She's presented herself admirably.

06:43.451 --> 06:46.011
So let's get to work.

07:01.069 --> 07:03.299
Hey. Ahem.

07:03.471 --> 07:04.905
Hey.

07:18.786 --> 07:20.686
You know this wasn't my idea, right?

07:20.855 --> 07:23.881
I mean, this isn't what I wanted.
Not like this.

07:24.592 --> 07:27.823
- I know that.
- Okay, so we're good?

07:28.563 --> 07:29.997
Yeah. No, we're good.

07:30.164 --> 07:31.393
Agents.

07:32.367 --> 07:33.562
What can I do for you?

07:33.735 --> 07:35.464
We'd like to talk to you
about Adrian Davis.

07:36.838 --> 07:39.364
There's nothing to talk about. Um...

07:39.540 --> 07:41.100
Claire, would you just give me
a second?

07:41.242 --> 07:42.641
Thanks.

07:43.578 --> 07:45.205
I told the investigators
seven years ago

07:45.380 --> 07:47.712
I cut off all communication with him
when he was arrested.

07:48.316 --> 07:51.911
Right. But you served with him.
You were his partner and his friend.

07:52.086 --> 07:54.020
And he betrayed me.

07:54.188 --> 07:55.986
Our company was taking off.

07:56.157 --> 07:58.785
After Adrian was caught,
our reputation was ruined.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.860
His greed cost us the company.

08:01.596 --> 08:03.860
I'm lucky. I got a second chance.

08:04.031 --> 08:05.396
This place is nice.

08:05.566 --> 08:08.365
And starting a business like this
takes capital, right?

08:08.536 --> 08:10.004
Like, lots of capital.

08:11.839 --> 08:14.308
Are you insinuating something?

08:14.475 --> 08:18.173
Because if you are,
they confiscated every penny he stole.

08:18.346 --> 08:19.507
Did they?

08:20.181 --> 08:23.082
I had nothing to do with it then.
I've got nothing to do with it now.

08:23.251 --> 08:24.343
We're done here.

08:24.519 --> 08:26.359
I just wanna take a look
around your warehouse.

08:27.155 --> 08:28.714
Not a chance.

08:28.890 --> 08:31.359
I cooperated with the Feds.
They didn't find anything.

08:32.326 --> 08:34.192
So, what's the harm?

08:34.929 --> 08:36.328
I'm running a business here.

08:36.496 --> 08:38.977
We've got a tight schedule.
I don't want my workers distracted.

08:39.133 --> 08:40.861
We could just get a warrant.

08:41.034 --> 08:42.433
Yeah?

08:44.872 --> 08:45.896
I'd bet you couldn't.

09:00.855 --> 09:02.095
How do you think Kensi and Eric

09:02.223 --> 09:03.748
- are gonna do together?
- Heh.

09:03.925 --> 09:05.791
- They get along.
- Uh-huh.

09:05.960 --> 09:09.089
Like an armadillo in Texas gets along
with a truck on the freeway?

09:09.263 --> 09:11.789
- Some of them may. Heh.
- Yeah.

09:23.744 --> 09:25.473
Here we go, G.

09:30.017 --> 09:31.507
Gun!

09:45.166 --> 09:48.033
That's one little friend
I didn't want to say hello to.

10:22.568 --> 10:24.229
What you doing?

10:25.338 --> 10:27.602
Well, Adrian Davis
is a security contractor,

10:27.774 --> 10:31.870
so I figured he would have
security cameras in his house.

10:33.346 --> 10:36.714
This one's got a pretty good
shot at one of the shooters.

10:36.883 --> 10:38.908
So you're running Facial Rec.

10:39.085 --> 10:40.450
Yeah.

10:41.955 --> 10:43.923
What would you like me to do?

10:44.757 --> 10:47.089
I don't know, really.

10:47.260 --> 10:50.093
Well, Hetty said I was supposed
to be helping,

10:50.263 --> 10:52.630
so there's got to be something
for me to do.

10:52.799 --> 10:57.965
Ah, well, I got a pretty big knot
in my shoulder right now.

10:59.706 --> 11:02.835
I'm just kidding. Of course I'd never
ask you to do anything like that.

11:03.743 --> 11:05.074
Even though it would be helping.

11:06.179 --> 11:08.910
Oh, really? So Nell would be
massaging you right now?

11:09.082 --> 11:12.211
No, because she'd be busy
actually doing something.

11:12.385 --> 11:14.479
What would she be doing, Eric?

11:14.654 --> 11:17.316
Remotely accessing Davis' computer,
mirroring the hard drive

11:17.490 --> 11:21.757
and initiating an SSH P3 protocol
for a complete sweep.

11:27.133 --> 11:29.534
- Which shoulder?
- Righty.

11:30.169 --> 11:31.330
Whoa, we got a hit.

11:33.106 --> 11:34.437
I'll call Callen.

11:36.309 --> 11:38.607
Okay. All right, thanks, Eric.

11:39.512 --> 11:42.106
Well, Davis' security cams
caught one of the guys.

11:42.281 --> 11:44.511
Facial Rec has ID'd him
as Alberto Jimenez.

11:44.684 --> 11:46.550
- Cotolo Cartel.
- Ah.

11:46.719 --> 11:49.211
Al Qaeda's hired
Cotolo muscle before.

11:49.389 --> 11:51.983
- I'll hit up one of my informants.
- Get anything from Stanfill?

11:52.158 --> 11:54.286
Well, we won't be getting
a Christmas card.

11:54.460 --> 11:56.451
Threatened a warrant,
he shut us down.

11:56.629 --> 12:00.429
That's when the little pixie had her
spidey-senses and they got all tingly.

12:01.667 --> 12:04.728
He claimed his company was doing
well before Adrian got caught.

12:04.904 --> 12:06.668
So I had Eric check up
on a few things.

12:06.839 --> 12:08.500
And that wasn't the case.

12:08.674 --> 12:11.302
Quite the opposite.
They were struggling to stay afloat.

12:11.477 --> 12:13.912
Three months after Stanfill
closed the security business

12:14.080 --> 12:16.981
and opened the wine company,
he was in the black, big time.

12:17.150 --> 12:19.881
Stanfill might be storing more
than wine.

12:20.053 --> 12:22.078
He's right that we don't have enough
for a warrant.

12:22.255 --> 12:24.189
But that doesn't mean
we can't take a little look

12:24.357 --> 12:26.189
- around his warehouse.
- Ha, ha.

12:26.826 --> 12:28.260
Did I miss something?

12:28.428 --> 12:30.419
Oh, yeah. Just the time
Sam went undercover

12:30.596 --> 12:32.291
for an entire year
as a somnambulist.

12:32.465 --> 12:33.785
You know, one of those wine guys.

12:33.933 --> 12:35.230
Sommelier, Deeks.

12:35.401 --> 12:37.165
A somnambulist is a sleepwalker.

12:37.336 --> 12:39.168
Kind of like what you do on the job.

12:40.540 --> 12:42.269
I know you say these things
out of love.

12:44.444 --> 12:45.969
- Yeah. Ahem.
- Yeah.

12:54.487 --> 12:56.285
Somnambulist.

12:56.456 --> 12:59.426
Like that giant clown on top
of the liquor store in the Valley.

12:59.592 --> 13:02.618
It is absolutely nothing
like that giant clown.

13:02.795 --> 13:04.320
What's different?

13:04.497 --> 13:06.226
A wine bottle is elegant.

13:06.399 --> 13:07.958
A clown is,

13:08.134 --> 13:09.568
you know, a clown.

13:10.903 --> 13:13.497
Oh, that's right, you don't like clowns,
do you?

13:13.673 --> 13:15.313
That's not the point
I was trying to make.

13:15.441 --> 13:17.201
But for the record, no,
I do not like clowns.

13:17.343 --> 13:18.743
Which is something
you already know.

13:18.878 --> 13:21.159
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
A lot of people are afraid.

13:21.314 --> 13:23.078
It's kind of a childhood,
uh, trauma thing.

13:23.249 --> 13:25.741
I am not afraid of clowns.

13:25.918 --> 13:28.888
What I am afraid of is you coming off
as one when we talk to Stanfill.

13:29.055 --> 13:30.420
So how about this:

13:30.590 --> 13:32.957
I'm an oenophile, you're the money.

13:33.126 --> 13:35.618
- I'm the money.
- You're a man of many assets.

13:35.795 --> 13:37.627
Few words. Okay?

13:37.797 --> 13:39.458
- I am the money.
- Yeah, but few words.

13:39.632 --> 13:40.656
- All right.
- Okay.

13:41.601 --> 13:43.569
I was very impressed with your Cab.

13:43.736 --> 13:45.864
Well integrated tannin, lively acidity.

13:46.038 --> 13:48.063
The subtlety of the oak,
that was a surprise.

13:48.241 --> 13:49.265
That was intentional.

13:49.442 --> 13:51.638
Notes of blackcurrant, tobacco.

13:51.811 --> 13:53.745
Figs and eucalyptus.

13:53.913 --> 13:55.972
- You know what, I didn't get the figs.
- No?

13:56.149 --> 13:58.469
But you know what, I really enjoyed
the chardonnay as well.

13:58.618 --> 14:01.280
I got to say, I think we'd be a good fit
for your winery.

14:01.454 --> 14:04.253
- You're kind of new to the business.
- Which is why we fight

14:04.423 --> 14:06.858
for quality product
whenever we can get our hands on it.

14:07.026 --> 14:09.146
- Who else have you met with?
- Paladette and Mestros.

14:09.295 --> 14:11.662
Good companies.
We've got a wider reach.

14:11.831 --> 14:13.151
My sales reps are on the doorstep

14:13.299 --> 14:15.779
of anybody daydreaming about
opening a new restaurant or store.

14:15.935 --> 14:17.425
That's what I like to hear.

14:18.905 --> 14:20.373
Appreciate your time, Mr. Stanfill.

14:20.540 --> 14:21.871
We want your business.

14:22.041 --> 14:23.133
I'll be in touch.

14:23.309 --> 14:24.470
- Thank you.
- Take care.

14:24.644 --> 14:26.203
Thanks.

14:26.712 --> 14:28.180
Unbelievable.

14:28.347 --> 14:30.372
He didn't get the figs.

14:32.919 --> 14:35.479
- This place is enormous.
- You thinking what I'm thinking?

14:35.655 --> 14:37.953
Yeah. It's the perfect place
to hide cash in plain sight.

14:38.124 --> 14:40.491
You remember what a million dollars
looked like?

14:41.060 --> 14:43.256
The size of a case of wine.

14:46.465 --> 14:47.933
Yeah.

14:48.668 --> 14:50.363
Lot of wine.

14:51.837 --> 14:54.329
See, the thing about Cls
is it's always about being in control.

14:54.507 --> 14:56.107
Little Dip understands
I'm the only thing

14:56.275 --> 14:57.640
standing between him and prison.

14:57.810 --> 15:00.302
Essentially, it's just about respect.

15:00.479 --> 15:03.073
- Wanna take some notes?
- I'll try.

15:07.220 --> 15:08.244
Yo, Little Dip.

15:13.059 --> 15:15.084
Slow your roll, Little Dip.

15:18.798 --> 15:20.892
Who's the homegirl? She's fine.

15:21.067 --> 15:24.435
- Yeah, finer than you'll ever be with.
- Oh, snap.

15:24.604 --> 15:26.038
You got some fire, girl.

15:26.205 --> 15:28.105
Nice ink. Carson 16 your crew?

15:31.310 --> 15:34.336
Oh, homegirl's got the words.

15:34.513 --> 15:35.537
Evidently.

15:35.715 --> 15:36.915
Hey, Deeks, you get a haircut?

15:37.083 --> 15:38.949
Yeah, I got a little trim.
Thanks for noticing.

15:39.118 --> 15:40.279
It's too flat.

15:40.453 --> 15:42.773
The beauty parlor could hook
you up with some curlers, man.

15:42.922 --> 15:44.356
I got mad height, son.

15:44.523 --> 15:47.584
You do have mad height.
This is style by pillow.

15:47.760 --> 15:50.889
So I don't put a lot of work into it.
But yours, yeah, it looks really good.

15:51.063 --> 15:53.964
This right here?
This is all natural, this volume.

15:54.133 --> 15:57.053
You know what I'm saying? It makes
the ladies go cray-cray for Little Dip.

15:57.203 --> 15:59.501
- Cray-cray.
- Focus up, Little Dip.

15:59.672 --> 16:01.333
Cotolos been working
with al Qaeda.

16:01.507 --> 16:04.306
Yo, I don't get involved
in that cartel-terrorist deal, so...

16:04.477 --> 16:07.310
We're not asking you to get involved,
we just need a location.

16:08.481 --> 16:10.813
Yo, I don't know, all right?
Yo, Cotolos don't play.

16:10.983 --> 16:13.077
They sent homeboy's head
to his family in a gift box.

16:13.252 --> 16:16.916
- Aw, does that scare you, Little Dip?
- Sounds scared.

16:17.089 --> 16:19.114
Because my partner here
says you're pretty slick.

16:19.292 --> 16:20.316
Super slick.

16:20.493 --> 16:22.962
Unless you don't think
you can handle it.

16:23.129 --> 16:26.724
This takes pretty big cojones, Little
Dip. I don't know if this is for you.

16:29.635 --> 16:31.535
Yeah, I got those.

16:33.839 --> 16:35.500
Yo, I ain't even making no promises.

16:36.642 --> 16:38.974
Okay. Well, see what you can do.

16:39.145 --> 16:43.173
- Yeah.
- Check you later, ma. Unh.

16:43.649 --> 16:44.673
Damn.

16:46.519 --> 16:49.955
Would I be correct in thinking you
believe Kensi needs to be assessed

16:50.122 --> 16:52.250
before sending her back into action?

16:54.093 --> 16:55.117
You would.

16:55.594 --> 16:56.994
She needs
to hit the ground running.

16:57.129 --> 16:59.120
Shouldn't spend too much time
thinking about it.

16:59.765 --> 17:02.928
My team, my call.

17:04.337 --> 17:07.329
This wouldn't be
about Agent Mansfield, would it?

17:08.374 --> 17:10.468
That's absurd.

17:10.943 --> 17:12.468
Is it?

17:13.913 --> 17:17.816
You put him back in the field
after the Sarajevo debacle in '95.

17:17.983 --> 17:20.714
- Careful, Owen.
- And he froze.

17:23.055 --> 17:25.046
Cost his partner his life.

17:29.028 --> 17:32.726
Do not presume to know me.

17:33.299 --> 17:34.824
Never.

17:36.869 --> 17:40.305
But I'm aware of the affection you have
for those under your charge.

17:41.440 --> 17:45.343
For some, they're just history.

17:45.511 --> 17:51.541
For me, they're names and faces.

17:51.717 --> 17:53.549
Well, two of your current agents,

17:53.719 --> 17:57.485
Deeks and Blye,
have a history, Henrietta.

17:57.890 --> 17:59.483
And you know
what I'm talking about.

18:01.460 --> 18:03.224
More than a work relationship.

18:04.330 --> 18:07.857
It's always such a treat

18:08.033 --> 18:11.367
to have these talks, Owen.

18:12.638 --> 18:14.572
Now, if you'll excuse me,

18:16.575 --> 18:19.044
I'll get back to work.

18:24.116 --> 18:25.880
You're tapping.

18:26.419 --> 18:28.444
I tap and I hum when I'm bored.

18:28.621 --> 18:31.147
- I also whistle and click my tongue.
- Please don't.

18:32.825 --> 18:34.589
Don't. Can you...? I asked you...

18:35.261 --> 18:36.660
You can stop this pain.

18:36.829 --> 18:40.459
All you gotta do is tell Hetty that
putting me in Ops was a terrible idea.

18:40.633 --> 18:41.862
- Yes.
- No, no.

18:42.034 --> 18:43.914
You're not supposed
to sound so excited about...

18:44.036 --> 18:45.197
No, no, no, listen.

18:45.371 --> 18:48.238
Remember how Stanfill said
that he hadn't spoken to Adrian Davis

18:48.407 --> 18:50.341
- since he was arrested?
- Yeah?

18:50.509 --> 18:52.238
Well, I ran a search for phone calls

18:52.411 --> 18:54.743
made from the pay phones
from where he was incarcerated.

18:55.448 --> 18:57.712
That's the number
for Stanfill Wine Distributors.

18:57.883 --> 19:00.716
It was made a week
before Adrian Davis was released.

19:00.886 --> 19:03.014
There are hundreds of inmates.
Could've been anybody.

19:03.189 --> 19:07.057
Which is why I accessed
the prison security camera footage.

19:11.030 --> 19:13.397
- That's Adrian Davis.
- Uh-huh.

19:13.732 --> 19:15.860
And the time code
from the prison security camera

19:16.035 --> 19:19.437
matches the date and time
of the call to Stanfill Wine.

19:19.605 --> 19:20.629
Stanfill lied to us.

19:20.806 --> 19:23.503
The GPS on his cell
says that he's at home.

19:23.676 --> 19:25.667
I'll call Callen.

19:27.746 --> 19:28.941
Federal agents.

19:29.114 --> 19:30.843
Stanfill.

19:31.016 --> 19:32.279
Sam, bullet holes.

19:34.253 --> 19:35.982
Got spent casings.

19:47.833 --> 19:49.267
G.

20:00.913 --> 20:03.245
So much for staying in touch.

20:22.033 --> 20:26.231
Ten thousand in hundred dollar bills.
Over 300 grand in the safe.

20:26.404 --> 20:28.839
Packaged just like the ones
stolen from Iraq.

20:29.007 --> 20:32.671
Well, gives a whole new meaning
to money laundering.

20:32.844 --> 20:36.246
The shell casings look like they match
the ones at Adrian Davis' place.

20:36.414 --> 20:37.575
So after killing Stanfill,

20:37.749 --> 20:40.377
Tarik and his cartel friends
find the safe,

20:40.552 --> 20:41.644
but can't open it.

20:41.819 --> 20:44.754
So they blow it off,
because they know it can't hold

20:44.923 --> 20:46.823
anywhere near the millions
they're looking for.

20:46.991 --> 20:49.460
Which is obviously somewhere else.

20:50.361 --> 20:51.556
Where?

20:55.266 --> 20:57.826
Mr. Stanfill told me
not to answer any questions

20:58.002 --> 21:00.471
about the warehouse operation
without his say-so.

21:00.638 --> 21:04.233
Well, that's gonna be a challenge.
Mr. Stanfill was murdered today.

21:04.409 --> 21:06.036
- What?
- Harold, look.

21:06.210 --> 21:08.330
As the manager of the warehouse,
you have two choices.

21:08.479 --> 21:11.278
Either you can be charged with
obstruction of a federal investigation,

21:11.449 --> 21:12.939
or you can cooperate with us.

21:17.488 --> 21:20.048
It's a time-sensitive offer, Harold.

21:22.393 --> 21:25.021
- He wouldn't hide money on the floor.
- Why not?

21:25.196 --> 21:26.891
Because there's
no permanent stock here.

21:27.065 --> 21:30.899
All these cases are gonna ship
to, uh, restaurants and stores.

21:31.069 --> 21:33.538
Couple of weeks, they'll be gone
and replaced with new ones.

21:35.139 --> 21:36.903
Was Stanfill a wine collector himself?

21:37.075 --> 21:38.372
He was.

21:38.543 --> 21:39.983
Where did he keep his private stock?

21:40.144 --> 21:42.511
Yeah, yeah, over here. I'll show you.

21:48.753 --> 21:51.017
Gave some of them to friends
once in a while.

21:51.189 --> 21:52.623
Most he kept for himself.

21:52.790 --> 21:54.952
New purchase
orders for Pasadena delivery

21:55.126 --> 21:57.686
are ready at Dock 8.

22:02.100 --> 22:04.194
- Decaf, Mr. Beale?
- Oh! Agh.

22:04.369 --> 22:05.928
I'm sorry.

22:06.104 --> 22:08.038
Feeling a little,
uh, agitated this morning.

22:08.206 --> 22:11.039
Trying to ease up on the caffeine.

22:12.310 --> 22:16.872
It doesn't seem to be doing much
for your nerves.

22:17.048 --> 22:19.107
Yeah, well...

22:19.283 --> 22:20.876
How are things up in Ops?

22:21.052 --> 22:24.113
Oh, good. Really good.
Excellent, in fact.

22:24.288 --> 22:26.655
You know, a few speed bumps,

22:26.824 --> 22:28.485
but every case has its bumps. Heh.

22:29.027 --> 22:34.158
And, uh, how are Miss Blye's
shock absorbers

22:34.332 --> 22:35.766
in your estimation?

22:35.933 --> 22:37.196
Pretty good. Yeah.

22:37.368 --> 22:39.564
They're not... Not... I wouldn't say,

22:39.737 --> 22:42.069
high-impact motocross good but,

22:42.240 --> 22:45.437
you know,
maybe more like Buick good.

22:45.610 --> 22:46.873
You know, smooth, but not...

22:47.578 --> 22:49.637
Not taking any sharp corners
these day...

22:50.381 --> 22:52.372
This analogy is not really working,
is it?

22:53.217 --> 22:55.185
Mm, not so much.

22:57.455 --> 23:00.550
Kensi is a great agent.

23:02.760 --> 23:04.819
Well, I know that, Mr. Beale.

23:04.996 --> 23:10.628
Yeah, so it would follow that,
um, she'd have greater success

23:10.868 --> 23:13.235
agenting.

23:13.404 --> 23:16.897
Miss Blye's technical prowess
may leave something to be desired,

23:17.075 --> 23:22.036
but your deductive skills
are in fine form.

23:24.115 --> 23:26.015
She's bored and restless, Hetty.

23:26.184 --> 23:28.084
And I don't blame her.

23:28.352 --> 23:30.514
But emotionally?

23:32.056 --> 23:34.081
Solid as a rock as far as I can tell.

23:36.494 --> 23:38.223
Thank you.

23:50.174 --> 23:53.109
Scooby, this one's about
half as light as the rest of them.

23:54.145 --> 23:58.548
Well, a million dollars should be half
as light as 12 bottles of wine.

24:06.791 --> 24:08.418
That's not even close to a million.

24:11.028 --> 24:12.962
What does F-81 mean?

24:13.564 --> 24:15.532
Our boy Harold should know
what that means.

24:16.968 --> 24:18.595
I have no idea what that means.

24:20.972 --> 24:22.736
That's not for delivery.
That's for pickup.

24:22.907 --> 24:24.375
By who?

24:24.542 --> 24:27.068
- Well, I have no idea.
- Where is it going?

24:27.612 --> 24:28.943
Damned if I know.

24:29.113 --> 24:30.553
You're the manager
and you don't know

24:30.715 --> 24:32.479
who's picking it up
or where it's going?

24:32.650 --> 24:34.778
- Nope. Never have.
- There have been others?

24:34.952 --> 24:38.445
Mr. Stanfill marks up a box
and when it's ready, I text a number,

24:38.623 --> 24:41.303
- and some woman picks it up.
- And you don't know where it's going?

24:41.459 --> 24:43.325
- Nope.
- How often did this happen?

24:43.494 --> 24:45.963
Maybe once a month,
since he started the company.

24:46.130 --> 24:49.623
Once a month? And you don't find that
the slightest bit unusual?

24:50.434 --> 24:51.868
Nope.

24:53.704 --> 24:55.672
I think it's time to send another text.

24:57.008 --> 24:59.943
Number's a burn phone
just like we thought.

25:00.311 --> 25:03.031
Well, unfortunately, that means
we have to keep staring at this blip,

25:03.181 --> 25:07.414
which, after careful analysis,
I've determined is not moving.

25:08.186 --> 25:11.019
Well, sometimes
that's part of the job in here.

25:11.355 --> 25:12.447
Not very exciting.

25:14.325 --> 25:15.918
That's actually okay, you know?

25:16.093 --> 25:18.425
I've spent so many more hours
on stakeouts.

25:18.596 --> 25:20.030
And you are so much less irritating

25:20.198 --> 25:22.098
than spending time with Deeks
in a car.

25:23.501 --> 25:25.128
Thanks.

25:25.603 --> 25:26.627
I think.

25:28.406 --> 25:30.932
So how long ago did that
warehouse manager send the text?

25:31.108 --> 25:33.406
Ninety-two minutes and 30 seconds.

25:33.578 --> 25:35.808
You know what they say
about a watched pot.

25:38.683 --> 25:41.709
Yeah. Eventually, it's got to boil.

25:50.995 --> 25:54.522
Showtime, guys. The GPS in the case
of wine says it's on the move.

26:14.385 --> 26:15.409
This your house?

26:15.586 --> 26:17.520
It's Mr. Foster's. I work for him.

26:17.688 --> 26:18.814
Mr. Foster home?

26:19.390 --> 26:22.087
- Of course.
- We need to speak with him.

26:22.293 --> 26:24.193
Please come in.

26:25.329 --> 26:28.788
Mr. Foster, there are
some people here to see you.

26:38.776 --> 26:40.073
What can I do for you?

26:55.358 --> 26:58.020
Mr. Foster, you received
a box of money every month

26:58.194 --> 27:00.822
from Gabriel Stanfill's company,
and you've never heard of him?

27:01.464 --> 27:03.228
No idea who that is.

27:07.403 --> 27:08.802
How do you pay your bills?

27:09.472 --> 27:10.906
My caregiver.

27:11.074 --> 27:13.907
- From your account?
- That's right.

27:14.911 --> 27:17.073
Something tells me your V.A. benefits

27:17.247 --> 27:19.079
aren't gonna match
those monthly balances.

27:21.484 --> 27:23.509
This morning,
Gabriel Stanfill was killed

27:23.686 --> 27:25.848
by cartel muscle hired by al Qaeda.

27:26.389 --> 27:27.914
And now they're after Adrian Davis.

27:28.091 --> 27:30.116
Someone else you claim
you've never heard of.

27:33.263 --> 27:35.163
If you don't help us, Brian,

27:35.331 --> 27:37.163
we might not be able to save Adrian.

27:40.470 --> 27:42.438
Thank you so much.
We really appreciate it.

27:42.605 --> 27:44.733
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

27:46.109 --> 27:47.702
- What'd you get?
- Not a lot.

27:47.877 --> 27:51.006
It's his mother's house. When she
passed away, Bethany moved in.

27:51.181 --> 27:52.774
She's his nurse and caregiver.

27:52.949 --> 27:54.229
She picks up a box once a month.

27:54.384 --> 27:56.876
She doesn't know what's in it
or who Stanfill and Davis are.

27:57.820 --> 28:00.152
It's not much of a story,
but they're on the same page.

28:00.723 --> 28:02.521
So, what now?

28:03.259 --> 28:05.284
Why don't you take her
into Interrogation?

28:06.596 --> 28:08.121
Guys?

28:09.666 --> 28:11.430
Those are at least an 11.

28:11.601 --> 28:12.727
Men's 11.

28:12.902 --> 28:13.994
Not Foster's.

28:17.807 --> 28:19.639
Cover the back. Nell, stay here.

28:30.486 --> 28:31.715
Damn it.

28:44.968 --> 28:45.992
Got you.

28:46.169 --> 28:47.728
- Deeks, what are you doing?
- Huh?

28:51.274 --> 28:52.901
You know, catching bad guys.

29:02.819 --> 29:04.419
Oh, it was like the Wild West
in Baghdad.

29:04.587 --> 29:07.056
There were guys taking out stacks
of hundreds in wheelbarrows.

29:07.223 --> 29:09.920
And it was just too much
to resist, huh?

29:10.093 --> 29:13.063
Why, I did at first,
but the other contractors pushed me.

29:13.229 --> 29:15.596
Said we deserved it,
putting ourselves at risk.

29:15.765 --> 29:16.789
Everyone was doing it?

29:17.700 --> 29:20.465
Yeah, well,
it doesn't make it right.

29:20.637 --> 29:24.267
And I told them. I said I wasn't
going down that rabbit hole.

29:25.642 --> 29:27.974
Then my contracts got canceled.

29:28.211 --> 29:29.645
I was underbid
on every one of them.

29:30.346 --> 29:31.643
They were sending you a message.

29:32.582 --> 29:35.608
Gabe wanted to know
what was going on, you know,

29:35.785 --> 29:37.310
so, we talked about it.

29:37.487 --> 29:38.750
And about Brian.

29:38.921 --> 29:41.788
- You and Stanfill served with Foster?
- Yeah.

29:41.958 --> 29:43.687
What happened?

29:46.062 --> 29:47.962
We were, uh,

29:48.131 --> 29:51.101
I don't know, about 20 klicks
out of Ramadi.

29:51.934 --> 29:54.528
Some of those trucks
are armor-plated,

29:54.704 --> 29:57.537
but not ours.

29:59.042 --> 30:01.602
Some kid playing with what looked
like a remote control toy car

30:01.778 --> 30:03.678
off the side of the road.

30:04.747 --> 30:07.045
They tell you to suspect everything.

30:08.084 --> 30:11.145
Just didn't even have time
to think about it really,

30:11.487 --> 30:12.511
but you always wonder.

30:12.689 --> 30:15.386
You know, Gabe and me,
we did a couple of days in a med unit,

30:15.558 --> 30:17.322
walked away with a few bruises.

30:18.094 --> 30:20.085
Brian, you know, he...

30:21.064 --> 30:22.759
V.A. wasn't doing right by him?

30:23.966 --> 30:27.300
Best they could, you know.
I don't fault those guys.

30:27.737 --> 30:28.863
He had the basics.

30:29.038 --> 30:31.973
But you and Stanfill wanted him
to have more than the basics?

30:33.509 --> 30:35.671
Seemed like the right call at the time.

30:35.845 --> 30:38.109
How much did you take out
of Baghdad for him?

30:39.048 --> 30:42.541
What they caught me with and a little
more I managed to get out before.

30:42.719 --> 30:43.948
What's a little bit more?

30:45.321 --> 30:46.761
I don't know.
A few hundred thousand.

30:46.923 --> 30:49.620
You were in Iraq for four years,
Adrian.

30:49.792 --> 30:51.021
Four years.

30:51.194 --> 30:52.662
That's all you managed to get out?

30:52.829 --> 30:56.732
Like I said, I wasn't comfortable
doing it in the first place.

31:04.240 --> 31:05.366
Hey.

31:06.342 --> 31:07.741
Hey, Nell.

31:09.579 --> 31:11.377
How's it going out there?

31:11.547 --> 31:14.039
Uh, it's good.

31:14.217 --> 31:17.517
It's interesting.

31:17.687 --> 31:20.418
It's kind of challenging.

31:21.591 --> 31:22.717
How's it going in here?

31:24.327 --> 31:28.093
Oh, you know, it's my reward for being
beaten and chained in a cave

31:28.264 --> 31:29.425
with my ex-fiancé.

31:30.299 --> 31:32.097
Yeah.

31:34.303 --> 31:36.465
Kens, you know when you...

31:37.206 --> 31:39.868
You really want something

31:40.042 --> 31:42.170
and you get it.

31:42.478 --> 31:43.673
But...

31:44.947 --> 31:48.679
somehow, it's not the way
that you wanted it at all?

31:52.555 --> 31:54.182
I want to be an agent.

31:55.425 --> 31:57.018
I do.

31:57.260 --> 31:58.728
But...

31:59.929 --> 32:01.590
Not like this.

32:07.570 --> 32:09.129
I get it.

32:10.106 --> 32:11.471
Oh, come on.

32:11.941 --> 32:13.306
What? What's wrong?

32:13.476 --> 32:15.467
The freaking firewall's
jamming me up.

32:18.881 --> 32:20.542
- You sure?
- I beg you.

32:24.120 --> 32:25.781
Okay. What's up?

32:25.955 --> 32:27.684
Brian Foster's personal
financial records

32:27.857 --> 32:29.916
were encrypted
by Monarca Securities.

32:30.092 --> 32:32.186
They knew what they were doing.

32:32.395 --> 32:34.591
Well, game on.

32:46.275 --> 32:47.299
There you go, Beale.

32:47.477 --> 32:49.969
And we're in.

32:51.514 --> 32:52.845
Jukebox?

32:53.015 --> 32:55.416
I think you mean jackpot.

32:55.585 --> 32:57.246
No, look here.

32:57.420 --> 33:00.481
Seven years ago, Brian Foster
bought a jukebox bar in the Valley.

33:00.656 --> 33:02.818
That's after he was injured in Iraq.

33:03.926 --> 33:05.826
That's odd.

33:10.766 --> 33:13.667
That rare Ceylon tea
we got you for your birthday.

33:13.836 --> 33:14.928
Is that it?

33:15.104 --> 33:16.970
It is.

33:17.139 --> 33:18.800
Is it everything you asked for
and more?

33:18.975 --> 33:21.967
- How is it?
- Oh, just fine.

33:22.144 --> 33:24.044
Good to hear.

33:24.313 --> 33:27.840
But I think, Mr. Deeks,

33:28.150 --> 33:31.211
you have something else
on your mind.

33:32.221 --> 33:34.349
I want my partner back.

33:34.924 --> 33:38.485
I need her back
and it's been five months.

33:38.728 --> 33:40.389
And she's right upstairs.

33:43.599 --> 33:45.363
And you shall have her back.

33:45.801 --> 33:48.896
Mm-hm. When exactly?

33:49.071 --> 33:54.532
When I determine that her mind
is sound enough to make decisions

33:54.710 --> 33:58.977
that will directly affect
the national security of this country.

33:59.148 --> 34:01.139
Right. I don't wanna
question your jud...

34:01.317 --> 34:03.809
And yet, you are.

34:03.986 --> 34:07.183
Okay, last question, then. Um...

34:08.391 --> 34:11.382
Honestly, is there more to this

34:11.893 --> 34:13.987
than what Kensi went through
in Afghanistan?

34:16.431 --> 34:19.197
I don't know, Mr. Deeks.

34:21.237 --> 34:23.034
Is there?

34:36.217 --> 34:38.083
It's the jukebox guy.

34:38.254 --> 34:40.552
Uh, does maintenance,
picks up the coinage.

34:40.723 --> 34:42.418
- He's your jukebox guy?
- Yeah.

34:43.726 --> 34:46.456
- How often do you see him?
- Uh, I never see him.

34:46.629 --> 34:49.724
He comes in once a month but it's
after we've closed and I've locked up.

34:49.899 --> 34:52.061
- He's got his own key.
- Can I get another drink?

34:52.234 --> 34:54.362
Natives are getting restless.
Excuse me.

34:54.536 --> 34:57.370
If you owned a million-dollar
wine warehouse,

34:57.540 --> 34:59.440
would you moonlight
as a jukebox repairman?

35:00.076 --> 35:02.306
No, I would not.

35:04.714 --> 35:08.082
Insides should be full of 45s, right?

35:08.250 --> 35:09.945
Yeah.

35:10.953 --> 35:15.413
Except this one doesn't play 45s.
It's been retrofitted for MP3s.

35:15.591 --> 35:17.821
It should be empty inside.

35:29.138 --> 35:31.163
Empty.

35:32.508 --> 35:34.067
Hold it.

35:34.243 --> 35:35.836
Not quite empty.

35:42.318 --> 35:44.184
- The money was here.
- Yeah.

35:44.353 --> 35:46.447
Stanfill moved it.

35:56.598 --> 35:58.760
You're never getting that money,
Adrian.

35:58.933 --> 36:00.293
The minute you walk out that door,

36:00.435 --> 36:02.062
you will be under
constant surveillance.

36:02.237 --> 36:06.538
If al Qaeda gets their hands on that
money, it could tip the balance in Iraq.

36:07.909 --> 36:09.638
You're a marine, Adrian.

36:10.278 --> 36:12.975
You made a pledge
to serve this country.

36:13.147 --> 36:15.241
Or did you conveniently forget that?

36:27.295 --> 36:28.524
It was 42.

36:31.432 --> 36:33.025
Forty-two million?

36:35.603 --> 36:36.661
Look,

36:36.838 --> 36:38.318
we know you and Stanfill
hid the money

36:38.473 --> 36:40.498
at the bar you bought for Foster.

36:40.675 --> 36:43.542
- But he moved it.
- What?

36:43.711 --> 36:46.043
I was still in lockup.
He never told me.

36:46.214 --> 36:47.682
No, that's the truth.

36:47.849 --> 36:50.181
There are al Qaeda operatives
hunting for you,

36:50.351 --> 36:52.911
willing to kill you for the money.

36:53.187 --> 36:55.747
And you have no idea where it is?

36:56.024 --> 36:57.685
You sure about that, Adrian?

36:58.426 --> 37:01.396
You've always been
a pretty good human lie detector.

37:02.263 --> 37:05.096
Thanks to my time spent
with you, Owen.

37:09.404 --> 37:13.966
Ah, Davis' lawyer
for the fifth time today.

37:14.142 --> 37:16.736
We have every right to hold him.

37:16.911 --> 37:20.643
Even if the valet's death was
self-defense, he still left the scene.

37:20.815 --> 37:21.976
That's true.

37:22.150 --> 37:27.054
But given his time served
and motive to help his comrade,

37:27.221 --> 37:30.350
I'm tempted to release him
on his own recognizance,

37:30.525 --> 37:33.893
at least until all of this gets worked out.

37:34.062 --> 37:35.427
It's your call.

37:35.997 --> 37:38.056
Always is.

38:25.213 --> 38:29.275
Our money you stole will go a long way
to helping our cause.

38:29.450 --> 38:30.645
Wait.

38:30.818 --> 38:32.616
You might want to think about this.

38:33.287 --> 38:34.311
Federal agents.

38:41.996 --> 38:44.328
Tarik? Game's over.

38:46.067 --> 38:47.899
On your knees.

38:50.405 --> 38:52.169
See, you got to stay in control,
Deeks.

38:54.876 --> 38:56.708
- Is that so?
- Mm.

38:57.211 --> 38:59.145
Yeah, because it's all about respect.

39:01.315 --> 39:03.374
Okay. Well played.

39:03.551 --> 39:05.246
Well played.

39:07.221 --> 39:08.421
Looks just like the real deal.

39:08.589 --> 39:11.081
Well, thanks to our assistant director,
some of it is.

39:11.259 --> 39:12.954
Question is, where's the real money?

39:13.127 --> 39:14.891
Surprised how fast they found me.

39:15.063 --> 39:16.792
Once we put word out
to our man Little Dip

39:16.964 --> 39:18.164
about where you'd be released,

39:18.332 --> 39:20.692
we knew it was a matter of time
before they had eyes on you.

39:20.835 --> 39:22.599
You put yourself at risk to help us.

39:22.770 --> 39:25.068
- That's gonna go a long way.
- Guys?

39:27.508 --> 39:29.272
Found this in Stanfill's desk.

39:29.444 --> 39:31.708
Has "For Adrian" written on the label.

39:31.879 --> 39:34.871
There was a rolled-up hundred
dollar bill with a note inside.

39:35.049 --> 39:36.676
Read that.

39:37.585 --> 39:40.520
"If you're reading this, I'm gone.
Enjoy the Pinot."

39:40.955 --> 39:42.595
Now, at first,
it didn't make sense to me.

39:42.723 --> 39:44.953
This isn't a Pinot. It's a Merlot.

39:45.893 --> 39:47.884
And you're smiling why?

39:53.568 --> 39:55.536
That's a Pinot.

39:59.207 --> 40:02.199
Hidden in plain sight.

40:02.376 --> 40:04.708
It was the DOJ's decision, Henrietta.

40:04.879 --> 40:07.177
Well, I think
that's an appropriate ending.

40:07.348 --> 40:08.907
I do too.

40:09.083 --> 40:11.984
- Good night, Owen.
- Good night.

40:17.225 --> 40:20.160
Due to Adrian Davis' cooperation,

40:20.328 --> 40:26.097
the DOJ has decided to consider
his punishment time served.

40:26.267 --> 40:28.531
- That's great.
- Yeah.

40:29.904 --> 40:32.032
Would you consider, um,

40:32.273 --> 40:33.399
doing the same for me?

40:35.443 --> 40:39.402
Keeping you here wasn't meant
as punishment, Miss Blye.

40:41.249 --> 40:42.808
I know.

40:44.952 --> 40:47.785
The truth is,
I don't know if you're ready.

40:49.557 --> 40:51.252
That being said,

40:51.425 --> 40:54.861
I don't know that keeping you here
will provide

40:55.029 --> 40:57.259
revelations.

40:58.099 --> 41:01.091
We won't know, will we,

41:01.602 --> 41:03.263
until you're back out there?

41:07.508 --> 41:11.001
Your friends have missed you dearly.

41:14.215 --> 41:15.944
Go.

41:16.117 --> 41:18.176
- You seem calmer, Eric.
- Oh, I am.

41:18.352 --> 41:21.049
Now that things are back to normal
in the department.

41:24.058 --> 41:26.117
- Hey.
- Hi.

41:26.294 --> 41:29.855
We haven't had a lot of time to chat
since you've been back.

41:30.898 --> 41:32.388
I know.

41:32.600 --> 41:34.125
It's gonna change.

41:35.336 --> 41:36.735
You mean, it's gonna change?

41:36.904 --> 41:38.584
Does that mean that...?
Wait. Are you back?

41:39.640 --> 41:41.404
Sure looks like it.

41:41.876 --> 41:43.173
That's good news.

41:43.344 --> 41:46.575
I was getting
a little worried because, uh...

41:46.747 --> 41:49.011
pretty sure Nell
was falling in love with me.

41:53.020 --> 41:54.988
God.

41:59.594 --> 42:01.426
And there she is.

42:02.496 --> 42:04.021
Here I am.

42:06.934 --> 42:08.902
It's good to be back.

42:09.670 --> 42:11.764
It's good to have you back.
