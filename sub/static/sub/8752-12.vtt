WEBVTT

00:11.911 --> 00:14.311
Somebody here is watching them.

00:14.354 --> 00:17.357
They just look creepy.

00:17.359 --> 00:19.095
I've been physically touch.

00:19.097 --> 00:21.868
Things like touching.
Ooh.

00:21.870 --> 00:24.544
They're cutting apart people
with swords.

00:24.546 --> 00:26.847
I just want a safe spot
for my family.

00:26.849 --> 00:28.349
I don't want my kids
experiencing

00:28.351 --> 00:29.717
anything that I have.

00:29.719 --> 00:33.456
They have their sights set
on the children here.

00:34.592 --> 00:36.397
It's really bad in here.

00:36.399 --> 00:38.566
My name is Amy Allan.

00:39.402 --> 00:41.604
Something is not right.

00:41.606 --> 00:42.740
I see dead people.

00:42.742 --> 00:44.978
This person might have been
a serial killer.

00:44.980 --> 00:46.815
I speak to dead people.

00:46.817 --> 00:48.550
You get those chills.

00:48.552 --> 00:49.918
And they speak to me.

00:49.920 --> 00:52.456
He is darkness.
He is evil.

00:52.458 --> 00:55.327
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

00:55.329 --> 00:57.129
I think she broke her neck.

00:57.131 --> 00:58.500
I rely on my partner.

00:58.502 --> 00:59.770
I'm Steve DiSchiavi.

00:59.772 --> 01:02.974
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:02.976 --> 01:04.309
You telling me the truth?

01:04.311 --> 01:07.413
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:07.415 --> 01:09.049
I think the devil is down here.

01:09.051 --> 01:10.551
It's my job to reveal them.

01:10.553 --> 01:11.719
Who the hell would do this?

01:11.721 --> 01:14.155
But Steve and I never speak...

01:14.157 --> 01:16.125
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:16.127 --> 01:17.493
...until the very end.

01:17.495 --> 01:18.862
Who's he looking to kill?

01:18.864 --> 01:20.831
We uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

01:20.833 --> 01:23.136
You need to get out of here
right now.

01:23.138 --> 01:24.305
Or time to get out.

01:24.307 --> 01:27.044
It was like endless darkness.

01:46.852 --> 01:52.464
Amy and I work each case
independently of one another.

01:52.466 --> 01:54.536
I interview living witnesses

01:54.538 --> 01:57.341
and uncover secrets
about the property's past

01:57.343 --> 01:59.811
while Amy communicates
with the dead.

02:03.887 --> 02:05.424
I'm in Rome, New York.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.463
It's about an hour
east of Syracuse.

02:07.465 --> 02:09.699
Amy and I got called in
by a young married couple,

02:09.701 --> 02:10.868
Sue and Joe.

02:10.870 --> 02:13.272
They didn't sound very good
on the phone.

02:13.274 --> 02:15.543
The activity's so bad
and so physical,

02:15.545 --> 02:17.814
Sue had moved out
with the three kids.

02:17.816 --> 02:18.950
But now she's back.

02:18.952 --> 02:21.323
She says if we can't help her
find a way

02:21.325 --> 02:24.192
to make the activity stop,
it may end her marriage.

02:24.194 --> 02:26.829
I'm really hoping
Amy and I can help them out.

02:32.670 --> 02:34.905
Before Amy arrives,

02:34.907 --> 02:38.079
I clear the area
of any leading information.

02:38.081 --> 02:40.914
Family photos
and other personal items

02:40.916 --> 02:43.015
need to be covered or removed.

02:43.017 --> 02:47.218
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

02:58.434 --> 03:00.536
So in my opening,

03:00.538 --> 03:07.044
I saw all of these thick trees,

03:07.046 --> 03:10.213
and there were all these
native American warriors

03:10.215 --> 03:13.148
standing there
with their bow and arrow drawn.

03:17.457 --> 03:20.859
They're waiting
for something to happen.

03:20.861 --> 03:24.329
They were put there
by this leader guy.

03:24.331 --> 03:28.967
He says it is some kind of,
like, spirit warfare.

03:33.941 --> 03:39.880
He says that there were problems
before the white man,

03:39.882 --> 03:44.654
that they had a lot of battles,
many battles,

03:44.656 --> 03:47.722
with these spirits.

03:55.859 --> 03:59.731
Sue, you sounded
clearly upset on the phone.

03:59.733 --> 04:03.237
Give me an idea
of what you're going through.

04:05.272 --> 04:08.941
We hear banging, knocking,
footsteps.

04:08.943 --> 04:11.111
I've seen apparitions.

04:11.113 --> 04:12.681
I've been physically touched.

04:12.683 --> 04:15.521
I've tried to rationalize
with myself

04:15.523 --> 04:17.490
a million times over again.

04:17.492 --> 04:19.491
I have tried to make up
every excuse in the book

04:19.493 --> 04:21.558
other than it being paranormal.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.861
Now, do you
believe in this stuff?

04:23.863 --> 04:25.631
What really made me
believe in it

04:25.633 --> 04:27.369
was when
my 8-year-old daughter,

04:27.371 --> 04:30.811
you know, she heard people
talking, whispering.

04:30.813 --> 04:32.313
- Is this your kids here?
- Yes.

04:33.882 --> 04:35.048
Now, who's who?

04:35.050 --> 04:36.249
This is Madison.

04:36.251 --> 04:37.184
Okay.

04:37.186 --> 04:39.321
That's Brooke Lynn and Joey.

04:39.323 --> 04:41.858
You had actually left with
the kids at one point, right?

04:41.860 --> 04:42.693
Yes.

04:42.695 --> 04:46.167
I moved out for 11 months.

04:47.838 --> 04:50.572
I just couldn't take it
anymore.

04:50.574 --> 04:53.177
They do not like to be alone.

04:53.179 --> 04:56.783
- So did you take them out
to protect them? - Yes.

04:56.785 --> 04:59.053
I don't want my kids
to grow up experiencing

04:59.055 --> 05:01.889
anything that I have.

05:03.292 --> 05:06.863
What made you come back home?

05:06.865 --> 05:09.469
I wanted my family back.

05:09.471 --> 05:13.412
I don't want them
to be from a broken home.

05:13.414 --> 05:14.780
But you came back to hell.

05:14.782 --> 05:15.781
Yeah.

05:15.783 --> 05:17.451
The same as it was
before I left.

05:17.453 --> 05:21.224
Have you guys ever thought
about just moving?

05:21.226 --> 05:23.528
That would be last resort
only because

05:23.530 --> 05:25.798
my husband inherited it
from his grandparents,

05:25.800 --> 05:28.866
so he's got
an emotional attachment.

05:31.972 --> 05:33.773
This native American guy

05:33.775 --> 05:37.512
says that there is some kind
of a family of beasts,

05:37.514 --> 05:41.576
and they think
that they're ghosts.

05:41.578 --> 05:45.815
These things are occasionally
trying to enter the house.

05:49.154 --> 05:52.089
They're very dark,

05:52.091 --> 05:55.658
and they look kind of like
human beings,

05:55.660 --> 05:58.296
but they're definitely not.

05:58.298 --> 05:59.831
Were they living?

05:59.833 --> 06:01.735
I don't know yet.

06:01.737 --> 06:04.837
They just look creepy.

06:10.174 --> 06:13.277
Okay, so why'd you
bring me in the kitchen?

06:13.279 --> 06:15.613
Well, we hear knocking
at the door.

06:15.615 --> 06:17.146
Okay.

06:17.148 --> 06:19.512
Get up, answer it,
nobody there.

06:19.514 --> 06:20.414
Okay.

06:20.416 --> 06:22.584
So, is anything else going on?

06:22.586 --> 06:25.022
Banging.

06:25.024 --> 06:27.893
It's a... bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang!

06:27.895 --> 06:29.192
Where does it sound like
it's coming from?

06:29.194 --> 06:31.926
The far right corner
of the living room.

06:31.928 --> 06:33.659
If something's wrong
with the pressure in the pipes,

06:33.661 --> 06:34.659
that would bang.

06:34.661 --> 06:36.594
All of our pipes
are in the basement.

06:36.596 --> 06:38.331
And does it happen
at any given time?

06:38.333 --> 06:39.534
Mainly at night.

06:39.536 --> 06:41.236
Well, that's got to scare
the hell out of you.

06:41.238 --> 06:42.603
Startles you.

06:42.605 --> 06:45.235
I mean, you'll jump out of
your skin when you hear it.

06:48.203 --> 06:52.540
These things are pretty tall.

06:52.542 --> 06:54.643
How tall?

06:54.645 --> 06:56.944
Well, see where
that dent thing is?

06:59.745 --> 07:01.778
About that tall.

07:01.780 --> 07:05.818
Their head kind of jets forward
on a long neck,

07:05.820 --> 07:07.154
and they're hunched,

07:07.156 --> 07:09.988
and you can really see
their shoulder blades.

07:09.990 --> 07:13.488
And also, they have, like,
a spine thing that sticks out.

07:13.490 --> 07:17.692
And then really long arms
with the long fingers.

07:17.694 --> 07:24.564
It's like a weird dragging sound
against the house.

07:28.833 --> 07:31.937
Do you have any idea how
the living might perceive them?

07:31.939 --> 07:35.038
Making noises
on the outside of the house,

07:35.040 --> 07:38.537
looking in through windows,
growling.

07:38.539 --> 07:40.170
Do you know what they want?

07:40.172 --> 07:43.641
They definitely have their
sights set on the children here.

07:46.679 --> 07:49.813
Maybe these are what
the native American warriors

07:49.815 --> 07:51.915
- are fending off?
- Hm.

07:51.917 --> 07:56.054
Maybe they are trying
to protect kids?

08:01.555 --> 08:06.758
I hear footsteps
walking in here at night.

08:06.760 --> 08:08.561
So it sounds like
it's in the room with you?

08:08.563 --> 08:09.462
Mm-hmm.

08:09.464 --> 08:11.131
Okay.
You have the TV in here now.

08:11.133 --> 08:12.599
- Do you keep the TV on?
- No.

08:12.601 --> 08:14.265
And there's no sounds
coming from upstairs,

08:14.267 --> 08:15.999
- like the kids walking around, or...
- No.

08:16.001 --> 08:18.269
Is anything else going on?

08:18.271 --> 08:21.475
Aside from being touched
a few times, no.

08:21.477 --> 08:23.678
What do you mean "touched"?

08:23.680 --> 08:26.313
Well, there was an incident
in the shower one time

08:26.315 --> 08:27.913
where I felt like
somebody had rubbed

08:27.915 --> 08:29.312
the outer part of my right arm.

08:29.314 --> 08:31.615
And there was another time...

08:31.617 --> 08:33.852
in the living room,
on the couch.

08:33.854 --> 08:35.155
Okay, what happened?

08:35.158 --> 08:40.827
I felt this... grope.

08:40.828 --> 08:43.361
So I'm assuming
it was forceful.

08:43.363 --> 08:45.296
Okay.

08:45.298 --> 08:48.202
Being touched,
it's a violation.

08:48.204 --> 08:51.205
Not only for me,
but for my husband.

08:51.207 --> 08:54.372
I will do whatever I have to do
to make sure that my kids

08:54.374 --> 08:57.206
do not experience
what I have experienced.

08:59.912 --> 09:04.854
They definitely messed
with the boy who lives here.

09:07.589 --> 09:09.623
In this one,
I just hear crying.

09:09.625 --> 09:14.763
Crying and things like touching.
Ooh.

09:14.765 --> 09:17.600
This is not good.

09:17.602 --> 09:18.433
Oh

09:18.435 --> 09:19.768
Like, trying to hide,

09:19.770 --> 09:22.402
and those weird [Bleep]
finger [Bleep] or whatever.

09:25.004 --> 09:28.512
He was crying
'cause he was scared.

09:28.514 --> 09:32.081
So, you mentioned you
were worried about the kids.

09:32.083 --> 09:34.213
What's going on with them?

09:34.215 --> 09:36.782
Well, Joey...
he's more of just...

09:36.784 --> 09:38.786
Scared to go upstairs alone.

09:38.788 --> 09:40.890
Brooke Lynn
also is the same way,

09:40.892 --> 09:42.927
but she seems to be
a little bit more sensitive.

09:42.929 --> 09:44.562
She's hearing voices.

09:44.564 --> 09:48.828
I wonder if she's being affected
more than I know.

09:48.830 --> 09:53.002
I don't want them to grow up
and be scared.

09:53.004 --> 09:56.675
You know, my worst fear
is that they might get worse.

09:56.677 --> 09:58.674
This is home to them,

09:58.676 --> 10:01.107
and they shouldn't be afraid.

10:03.111 --> 10:05.716
Well, for some
[Bleep] up reason,

10:05.718 --> 10:07.386
dead people come here.

10:07.388 --> 10:11.288
I see this dead woman.

10:11.290 --> 10:13.622
She's kneeling on the floor
right here.

10:13.624 --> 10:16.026
She's only one of many...
many of them.

10:18.832 --> 10:21.969
I think the creatures here
have never been human,

10:21.971 --> 10:24.602
but now I'm seeing dead people
lined up,

10:24.604 --> 10:26.871
and they're seeking help
from a living person.

10:26.873 --> 10:30.680
This person here might have...

10:30.682 --> 10:34.084
ohh... an idea
that they are a medium.

10:34.086 --> 10:38.318
Dead people
coming to get moved on.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.222
This is not good for them.

10:40.224 --> 10:42.058
No, this kid's got to go.

11:04.843 --> 11:05.910
Joe, your wife, Sue,

11:05.912 --> 11:08.344
said that you actually grew up
in this house as a kid.

11:08.346 --> 11:11.783
My grandparents used to live
in this house when I was a kid.

11:11.785 --> 11:14.087
- I grew up across the street.
- Okay.

11:14.089 --> 11:15.891
So, I was always over here.

11:15.893 --> 11:18.191
Did you have experiences
as a kid here?

11:18.193 --> 11:20.459
You know,
a couple different times,

11:20.461 --> 11:23.195
but I kind of blew it off as,
you know, it's no big deal.

11:23.197 --> 11:24.933
So your grandparents, I assume,

11:24.935 --> 11:27.972
- the way you're talking now,
they both passed away? - Yeah.

11:27.974 --> 11:29.807
My grandmother passed in 1997.

11:29.809 --> 11:32.308
She had developed emphysema,

11:32.310 --> 11:35.243
and then the emphysema
led to bone cancer.

11:35.245 --> 11:38.949
She passed away in the house,
under hospice care.

11:38.951 --> 11:39.784
Okay.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.885
What kind of woman was she?

11:41.887 --> 11:44.085
She treated me like, you know,
her little prince,

11:44.087 --> 11:45.152
to be honest with you,

11:45.154 --> 11:46.955
and that's how she always
made me feel.

11:46.957 --> 11:49.960
She made me feel loved.

11:49.962 --> 11:54.232
Very kindhearted lady.
Loved to cook.

11:54.234 --> 11:55.698
I mean, I miss her cooking.

11:55.700 --> 11:57.399
You know,
she was my role model.

11:57.401 --> 12:00.103
When Grandma passed on,
it was very hard for me.

12:03.359 --> 12:05.830
I'm getting this older woman.

12:05.832 --> 12:08.368
She was always cooking
and cleaning in here.

12:08.370 --> 12:09.368
She was little.

12:09.370 --> 12:13.203
Tiny, little lady.
Very frail.

12:13.205 --> 12:18.443
And she's putzing around,
putzing around.

12:18.445 --> 12:21.981
She's, I don't know, related
to somebody here or something?

12:21.983 --> 12:24.216
Living?

12:24.218 --> 12:25.918
Yes.

12:27.387 --> 12:31.425
Now, Joe, when did
your grandfather die?

12:31.427 --> 12:35.198
He died September 10, 2001,
the day before 9/11.

12:35.200 --> 12:36.098
Wow.

12:36.100 --> 12:38.367
I'm not sure how he passed on.

12:38.369 --> 12:41.436
There was never
an autopsy done.

12:41.438 --> 12:44.475
I think that he had
a massive heart attack.

12:44.477 --> 12:47.613
He was a hard-core smoker,
three packs a day.

12:47.615 --> 12:50.715
He actually passed away
right here in the kitchen,

12:50.717 --> 12:52.918
and he was, you know,
dead on the floor.

12:52.920 --> 12:54.419
Okay.

12:54.421 --> 12:56.255
Do you know how old
grandpa was when he died?

12:56.257 --> 12:57.425
75.

12:57.427 --> 12:59.695
Okay, so what kind of a guy
was your grandfather?

12:59.947 --> 13:02.715
He was a Sicilian-American
immigrant.

13:02.717 --> 13:05.519
He was very tough, hard-nosed,
old-school Italian.

13:05.521 --> 13:07.323
Somebody that I looked up to.

13:07.325 --> 13:09.294
I actually have a picture here

13:09.296 --> 13:12.132
of him and I
from when I was a little guy.

13:12.134 --> 13:14.800
Joe, you obviously
knew your grandparents

13:14.802 --> 13:16.701
- better than anybody.
- Right.

13:16.703 --> 13:17.969
Would they want you

13:17.971 --> 13:20.104
to stay here and fight
whatever the hell is going on?

13:20.106 --> 13:21.875
They wouldn't want me
to give up.

13:21.877 --> 13:23.111
Right.

13:23.113 --> 13:25.447
They would want me to fight
for what is mine.

13:25.449 --> 13:29.648
And they instilled in me,
you know, you never give up.

13:35.359 --> 13:38.626
I see, like,
some kids running by.

13:38.628 --> 13:43.063
A little girl
and, I think, a little boy.

13:43.065 --> 13:46.832
They're probably
between, like, 5 and 8?

13:46.834 --> 13:50.938
Somebody here is watching them.

13:50.940 --> 13:54.675
I think that this is a male.

13:54.677 --> 13:58.513
He's pretty dang old.
He's probably like 70 maybe.

13:58.515 --> 14:01.082
Yeah, I think he's Italian.

14:01.084 --> 14:02.519
A heavy, heavy smoker.

14:02.521 --> 14:04.555
He's not a bad guy.

14:04.557 --> 14:06.858
Do you know when he's from?

14:06.860 --> 14:11.397
Maybe he died
in, like, the '90s?

14:11.399 --> 14:15.469
1990s? Early 2000?

14:15.471 --> 14:17.270
Do you know how he died?

14:17.272 --> 14:19.406
I think he had a heart attack.

14:19.408 --> 14:21.041
Maybe it was emphysema,

14:21.043 --> 14:25.213
'cause I can't [Bleep] breathe
for [Bleep] from him.

14:31.382 --> 14:34.952
So, Joe, what made you
bring me out here?

14:34.954 --> 14:36.321
I was inside, and I noticed,

14:36.323 --> 14:39.527
off to the right-hand side,
over here,

14:39.529 --> 14:40.796
there was two mirrors,

14:40.798 --> 14:42.967
and I noticed
that both of 'em cracked

14:42.969 --> 14:44.369
and was just stunned.

14:44.371 --> 14:46.669
Kind of really frightened me,
to be honest with you.

14:46.671 --> 14:48.935
So, did anything hit it that
would have caused it to crack?

14:48.937 --> 14:51.905
There was nothing that
could have been thrown at it,

14:51.907 --> 14:53.140
nothing that hit it.

14:53.142 --> 14:55.944
It wasn't broke
when I looked at it

14:55.946 --> 14:57.746
three minutes
prior to this happening.

14:57.748 --> 14:59.015
Okay.

14:59.017 --> 15:00.447
Let me ask you a question, Joe.

15:00.449 --> 15:02.282
What are you trying to get
out of our investigation?

15:02.284 --> 15:03.817
What's the best thing
we could do for you?

15:03.819 --> 15:06.153
I don't want the kids
to be affected.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.924
I don't want to have to keep
things from them.

15:08.926 --> 15:11.828
You know, as a dad
and as a father,

15:11.830 --> 15:14.527
I just want to be there
to protect them.

15:14.529 --> 15:16.262
I just want things to stop.

15:16.264 --> 15:18.298
It's been tough
on your marriage.

15:18.300 --> 15:21.870
Yeah, it's been tough.
It's weighed pretty hard.

15:21.872 --> 15:24.307
You know, it's tough
to talk about those things

15:24.309 --> 15:27.176
because she means
everything to me,

15:27.178 --> 15:30.379
and without her,
I would have no family.

15:30.381 --> 15:32.548
Since she has come back,
you know,

15:32.550 --> 15:34.549
she's been touched and whatnot,

15:34.551 --> 15:37.051
and I just want a safe spot
for my family.

15:37.053 --> 15:38.919
That's all that I want, really.

15:54.095 --> 15:55.732
I combed through
my client's property records,

15:55.734 --> 15:57.201
and as it turns out,

15:57.203 --> 16:00.071
a family lived on the land
for 50 years.

16:00.073 --> 16:02.842
Most of the time,
this doesn't amount to much,

16:02.844 --> 16:04.511
but I spoke
to a local genealogist

16:04.513 --> 16:06.613
who told me the family
that lived on the land

16:06.615 --> 16:09.784
suffered enough tragedy
to last ten lifetimes.

16:18.831 --> 16:20.299
Kobler family...

16:20.301 --> 16:23.636
they lived on my client's
property for almost 50 years.

16:23.638 --> 16:25.739
From about 1874 to 1919.

16:25.741 --> 16:27.508
Now, when we spoke
on the phone,

16:27.510 --> 16:29.478
you said that there
were some terrible times

16:29.480 --> 16:31.747
- on the property when they were there.
- There was.

16:31.749 --> 16:34.685
It all seems to center around
this guy, Henry J. Kobler.

16:37.523 --> 16:41.661
It started at the age of 9
when his dad died.

16:41.663 --> 16:43.997
His father
was about 34 years old

16:43.999 --> 16:47.502
and passed away
of unknown reasons.

16:47.504 --> 16:48.837
34 is young.

16:48.839 --> 16:50.706
- It is very young.
- Okay.

16:50.708 --> 16:53.210
And as part
of his father's will,

16:53.212 --> 16:55.846
Henry was actually to be given
to another family

16:55.848 --> 16:59.285
as a valuable farmhand
as a way for the family to live.

16:59.287 --> 17:01.487
I've never heard of that
before.

17:01.489 --> 17:05.226
And this lasted for five years

17:05.228 --> 17:07.162
when he was finally returned
to his mother.

17:07.164 --> 17:08.530
Okay.

17:08.531 --> 17:09.732
But it continues.

17:09.733 --> 17:11.768
In 1901, his grandmother,

17:11.770 --> 17:13.303
who was about 83 years old...

17:13.305 --> 17:15.406
keep in mind, she was deaf...

17:15.407 --> 17:18.743
was picking berries one day
on the property

17:18.746 --> 17:23.483
and was attacked by a bull
and killed.

17:23.486 --> 17:24.852
She was mutilated.

17:24.854 --> 17:26.188
All right.

17:28.725 --> 17:33.664
There's this crazy lady
who does run around outside.

17:36.102 --> 17:40.340
She's just all over
the [Bleep] place.

17:40.342 --> 17:42.843
And she did die poorly.

17:42.845 --> 17:45.113
What do you mean?

17:45.115 --> 17:46.982
Her head, you know, got...

17:46.984 --> 17:49.319
it got chopped off...

17:49.321 --> 17:50.821
or ripped off, more.

17:50.823 --> 17:54.359
It's not a nice, clean cut.

17:57.464 --> 17:59.599
Oh, my gosh.

17:59.601 --> 18:01.335
It's messy, very messy.

18:05.074 --> 18:08.144
I'm almost afraid to ask.
What else happened to him?

18:08.146 --> 18:10.614
This is probably
the darkest part of his life.

18:10.616 --> 18:14.085
He had a daughter.
Her name was Ella.

18:15.422 --> 18:19.893
And in 1920,
she was 16 years old,

18:19.895 --> 18:22.664
and she was coming home
from a friend's house,

18:22.666 --> 18:25.434
and she was struck by a car.

18:25.436 --> 18:27.404
Wow.

18:27.406 --> 18:30.875
She was an only child.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.677
Oh, geez.

18:32.679 --> 18:35.147
- This guy can't catch a break, can he?
- Correct.

18:35.149 --> 18:38.485
And actually, three years later,
his wife, Fannie,

18:38.487 --> 18:41.389
she passed away
of a botched surgery.

18:41.391 --> 18:42.591
You're kidding.

18:42.593 --> 18:46.563
She was having a routine
stomach procedure,

18:46.565 --> 18:50.067
and she just died mysteriously
and unexpectedly.

18:50.069 --> 18:51.636
Wow.

18:51.638 --> 18:54.407
He ended up passing away
at the age of 67.

18:54.409 --> 18:57.244
The tragedy in this guy's life
is overwhelming.

19:04.854 --> 19:08.191
This native American guy
is saying, like,

19:08.193 --> 19:10.094
how it's not safe here.

19:10.096 --> 19:12.964
There's no place
that's safe here.

19:12.966 --> 19:16.008
Everyone's at risk.

19:16.010 --> 19:20.813
He is saying that, um...

19:20.815 --> 19:26.819
that everyone knew
that nobody should be here.

19:26.821 --> 19:30.917
That people shouldn't live
in this area.

19:30.919 --> 19:34.753
That it's just for ghosts
to live.

19:34.755 --> 19:39.355
So, he just wants to help them
clear the area out.

19:39.357 --> 19:41.457
Of what?

19:45.127 --> 19:46.661
Living people.

20:05.939 --> 20:09.175
So far,
I've uncovered multiple deaths

20:09.177 --> 20:11.610
that are directly tied
to my client's property.

20:12.612 --> 20:15.981
But I need to see
if there's anything else.

20:15.983 --> 20:18.818
Digging through old records,
I find the Joslin family

20:18.820 --> 20:21.253
originally owned
the land I'm investigating.

20:21.255 --> 20:25.791
Turns out, they suffered a lot
of loss in their time there.

20:29.928 --> 20:31.230
I'm on my way to meet

20:31.232 --> 20:33.666
with a local historian
who did some digging for me.

20:33.668 --> 20:35.834
She says she found
some information

20:35.836 --> 20:37.937
that will definitely help
my case.

20:45.411 --> 20:47.446
Now, Mary,
when I did my research,

20:47.448 --> 20:49.281
I came across
a couple of deaths

20:49.283 --> 20:50.749
associated
with the Joslin family,

20:50.751 --> 20:53.252
- but you said there was a lot more.
- There was a lot more, yes.

20:53.254 --> 20:55.587
- Okay, how many are we talking about?
- They had ten children,

20:55.589 --> 20:58.423
and four of those children died
as babies.

20:58.425 --> 21:01.126
And then they had
two young adults die

21:01.128 --> 21:02.427
from tuberculosis,

21:02.429 --> 21:05.130
which was very prevalent
in that era.

21:05.132 --> 21:08.533
Now, Mary, out of the remaining
kids that lived,

21:08.535 --> 21:10.702
did any of them
stay on the property?

21:10.704 --> 21:11.703
Yes, Foster did.

21:11.705 --> 21:13.171
Okay, so what happened
with him?

21:13.173 --> 21:15.540
He lived to be
about 60 years old.

21:15.542 --> 21:17.075
He was a very busy man.

21:17.077 --> 21:19.111
He married at the age of 58,

21:19.113 --> 21:23.081
and they had one child,
who died as a baby.

21:23.083 --> 21:25.350
Shortly afterwards,
not even a year later,

21:25.352 --> 21:27.786
Foster dies on that property.

21:30.923 --> 21:35.060
I'm seeing
those weird creatures again.

21:35.062 --> 21:37.963
A lot of children
they would eat.

21:37.965 --> 21:40.398
I do see, like,
the kids are being bit.

21:42.970 --> 21:44.335
Open their chests.

21:44.337 --> 21:46.938
The leader
of the native Americans

21:46.940 --> 21:48.840
is showing me a horrifying scene

21:48.842 --> 21:51.843
where the tall creatures
by the side of the house

21:51.845 --> 21:53.478
are killing small children.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.913
Kids?

21:54.915 --> 21:56.047
Kids.

21:58.384 --> 22:02.287
It's pretty gross and sad.

22:07.693 --> 22:09.761
In my research, I also found out

22:09.763 --> 22:11.629
that my client's property
was near

22:11.631 --> 22:14.465
the site of a bloody battle
during the French-Indian war.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.901
I'm heading over
to meet with a local historian

22:16.903 --> 22:18.236
at the actual battle site.

22:18.238 --> 22:20.371
He tells me
it was the most violent fight

22:20.373 --> 22:21.639
in the region's history.

22:29.280 --> 22:33.384
This is where the actual
Battle of Fort Bull took place

22:33.386 --> 22:36.354
in March 27, 1756.

22:36.356 --> 22:38.689
What was the French-Indian war
all about?

22:38.691 --> 22:40.458
It was between
two superpowers...

22:40.460 --> 22:41.826
the British and the French.

22:41.828 --> 22:44.161
The British
were building forts here,

22:44.163 --> 22:48.232
and the French felt that it was
getting too close to their area,

22:48.234 --> 22:49.600
so they sent the men down here

22:49.602 --> 22:51.736
with the Indians from Canada,

22:51.738 --> 22:53.971
and they ended up
surrounding the fort.

22:53.973 --> 22:55.072
And who led these people?

22:55.074 --> 22:57.308
The Lieutenant Gaspard de LÃ©ry.

22:57.310 --> 22:58.309
Okay.

22:58.311 --> 23:00.611
And he had with him
the Indian...

23:00.613 --> 23:03.080
Colonel Louis Cook,
who was from Canada.

23:03.082 --> 23:05.883
Okay, so now what went down
with this fight?

23:05.885 --> 23:07.952
- The British were inside this fort here.
- Okay.

23:07.954 --> 23:10.588
The French come up
to the holes in the fort

23:10.590 --> 23:12.223
and were shooting in there,

23:12.225 --> 23:13.557
then they started chopping
at the door.

23:13.559 --> 23:15.659
And finally,
they got through it,

23:15.661 --> 23:18.028
and they're cutting apart people
with swords,

23:18.030 --> 23:19.663
and then they were
scalping them.

23:19.665 --> 23:21.098
Wow.

23:21.100 --> 23:22.299
It was a bloodbath.

23:22.301 --> 23:26.403
The British ended up losing
approximately 60 men.

23:26.405 --> 23:29.373
So, what wound up happening
to the fort?

23:29.375 --> 23:31.575
The French burned it down
with he bodies right in it.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.110
Okay.

23:35.146 --> 23:39.817
Somebody says something
about the dead man down there.

23:39.819 --> 23:41.385
I guess they were settlers.

23:41.387 --> 23:43.287
For whatever reason,

23:43.289 --> 23:46.523
they seem to be stuck
down there.

23:50.495 --> 23:53.463
I do see one of them getting
their head bashed in.

23:54.965 --> 23:59.569
I think they got ambushed,
were brutally murdered.

23:59.571 --> 24:01.071
Yeah.

24:01.073 --> 24:03.240
Do you know who ambushed them?

24:03.242 --> 24:05.342
I think
it was native Americans.

24:11.949 --> 24:16.253
I saw many entities
during my walk,

24:16.255 --> 24:18.388
but two stood out the clearest.

24:18.390 --> 24:21.224
First, the old man
watching over the kids.

24:21.226 --> 24:26.296
He was probably 60, 65.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.465
Heavyset.

24:28.467 --> 24:32.002
Very long eyebrows, very thick.

24:32.004 --> 24:34.104
His nose is rather large.

24:34.106 --> 24:37.607
Next, I described
the tall, dangerous creatures

24:37.609 --> 24:39.476
by the side of the house.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.478
It was hunched.

24:41.480 --> 24:45.381
The shoulder blades
were kind of popping out.

24:45.383 --> 24:49.185
It didn't have any features.

24:54.657 --> 24:57.192
Yes, that's what I saw.

25:16.237 --> 25:19.706
Now that Amy and I have
finished our investigations,

25:19.708 --> 25:21.574
it's time to reveal our findings

25:21.576 --> 25:24.544
to our clients and each other
for the first time.

25:24.546 --> 25:26.679
Amy, I'd like you to meet
Joe and Sue.

25:26.681 --> 25:30.350
They're a great,
down-to-earth couple,

25:30.352 --> 25:32.485
but the activity in the house
is ripping them apart.

25:32.487 --> 25:34.454
It's got so bad last year,

25:34.456 --> 25:36.789
Sue actually left
with the three kids

25:36.791 --> 25:39.392
and moved out
and stayed away for a while.

25:39.394 --> 25:41.761
She's been back
around, what, five months?

25:41.763 --> 25:44.564
Actually, the activity's
gotten even worse now.

25:44.566 --> 25:46.499
They needed our help,
and they want to know

25:46.501 --> 25:49.135
if they can actually stay here
and be safe with their family.

25:49.137 --> 25:50.736
So now that Amy knows
a little bit

25:50.738 --> 25:52.405
about what's going on
with you guys,

25:52.407 --> 25:54.407
I'm gonna ask her to describe
her walk for us.

25:58.846 --> 26:05.117
When I first opened,
I saw native Americans,

26:05.119 --> 26:08.521
and they had
their bows and arrows drawn,

26:08.523 --> 26:11.424
and they were
just in that stance.

26:11.426 --> 26:18.464
I got that they were alive
around 1740, 1750s.

26:18.466 --> 26:22.568
What they're doing is attempting
to protect the area.

26:22.570 --> 26:26.539
There was some type of...

26:26.541 --> 26:30.309
and still is... some kind of,
like, spiritual warfare

26:30.311 --> 26:31.744
going on for them.

26:31.746 --> 26:36.148
I met this older
native American man.

26:36.150 --> 26:38.284
What he said
was that this place

26:38.286 --> 26:42.421
was not meant
for the living to be in.

26:42.423 --> 26:44.690
It is meant for the dead.

26:44.692 --> 26:47.726
I'm not surprised you saw
native Americans

26:47.728 --> 26:50.863
because the British had set up
a fort on the land here.

26:50.865 --> 26:52.598
It was called Fort Bull
back then,

26:52.600 --> 26:58.737
in March 27, 1756,
the French and Canadian Indians

26:58.739 --> 27:01.974
came down here
during the French-Indian wars,

27:01.976 --> 27:03.909
and they attacked the fort.

27:03.911 --> 27:06.511
It was known as
the Fort Bull Massacre.

27:06.513 --> 27:07.846
Now, the guy I spoke to said

27:07.848 --> 27:09.681
it was probably
the bloodiest battle

27:09.683 --> 27:11.817
that was fought
during the French-Indian war

27:11.819 --> 27:13.952
near your property.

27:13.954 --> 27:16.688
Now, the native American
you spoke to

27:16.690 --> 27:18.223
said it wasn't safe
for the living here.

27:18.225 --> 27:19.491
No.

27:19.493 --> 27:22.360
Doing the research
on your property, I went back.

27:22.362 --> 27:23.795
The first white settlers
on your land

27:23.797 --> 27:25.130
was the Joslin family.

27:25.132 --> 27:27.566
They settled in the 1840s.

27:27.568 --> 27:29.634
Hosea and Louisa.
They had ten kids.

27:29.636 --> 27:32.370
Six of them died.

27:33.806 --> 27:38.443
1874, the Koblers
moved into your property.

27:38.445 --> 27:41.046
Most of the tragedy
surrounds a guy named Henry J.

27:41.048 --> 27:45.083
I actually got a photo of him.

27:45.085 --> 27:49.621
He moved onto your property,
he was about... he was a kid.

27:49.623 --> 27:53.925
Three years after he gets there,
his father drops dead,

27:53.927 --> 27:55.960
- 34 years old.
- Oh.

27:55.962 --> 27:58.463
In the will, he's willed off
to be an indentured slave

27:58.465 --> 27:59.731
for some other farm family.

27:59.733 --> 28:02.467
- What?
- Took the mother five years to get him back.

28:02.469 --> 28:07.172
Now, a few years later, 1901,
on your property,

28:07.174 --> 28:09.007
his grandmother, who is deaf,

28:09.009 --> 28:13.278
gets gored to death by a bull
on the property.

28:14.446 --> 28:16.147
Next thing you know,
he gets married,

28:16.149 --> 28:17.415
lives on your property.

28:17.417 --> 28:20.518
His 16-year-old daughter
is coming home on a bicycle.

28:20.520 --> 28:23.021
- She gets hit by a car and killed.
- Oh.

28:23.023 --> 28:24.655
I got a picture of her.

28:24.657 --> 28:28.059
Wow.

28:28.061 --> 28:30.528
Three years after that happens,

28:30.530 --> 28:33.931
his wife goes in
for a simple stomach procedure.

28:33.933 --> 28:34.932
She dies.

28:36.535 --> 28:38.502
So, it's like
there's nothing but death

28:38.504 --> 28:39.804
surrounding this property.

28:42.906 --> 28:45.109
Are you surprised to hear
about all this tragedy?

28:45.111 --> 28:46.577
No, not really.

28:46.579 --> 28:50.114
The location,
it's not healthy for the living.

28:52.184 --> 28:54.919
When I went into the kitchen,

28:54.921 --> 28:58.422
I encountered an older woman,

28:58.424 --> 29:00.391
and from her specifically,

29:00.393 --> 29:02.393
I got that there was
a relationship

29:02.395 --> 29:05.262
with someone living
in the house now.

29:05.264 --> 29:09.200
She prefers the kitchen area,

29:09.202 --> 29:11.635
and then a bit later,
when I went upstairs,

29:11.637 --> 29:13.137
I encountered an older man.

29:13.139 --> 29:17.541
And both of them seem to have
strong ties to the house.

29:17.543 --> 29:20.177
And he was watching
two children playing.

29:20.179 --> 29:22.012
He looked Italian.

29:22.014 --> 29:24.615
He was wearing suspenders.

29:24.617 --> 29:29.019
He definitely did
a lot of work outside.

29:29.021 --> 29:31.622
And when I was around him,
I couldn't breathe.

29:31.624 --> 29:35.659
Like, I felt
that he was a very heavy smoker,

29:35.661 --> 29:41.632
and he either died
of a heart attack or emphysema.

29:41.634 --> 29:44.868
And I think that he died
in the '90s or early 2000s.

29:44.870 --> 29:48.438
I would say that those would be
my grandparents, for sure.

29:49.874 --> 29:53.477
Both of them were smokers.
Grandma was a light smoker.

29:53.479 --> 29:55.379
Grandpa was a heavy smoker.

29:55.381 --> 29:58.048
Worked construction
his whole entire life.

29:58.050 --> 30:02.019
Grandma's favorite spot
was the kitchen,

30:02.021 --> 30:04.121
and I remember,
as a little kid,

30:04.123 --> 30:06.023
Grandpa used to spend
a lot of time

30:06.025 --> 30:07.324
at the top of the stairs.

30:07.326 --> 30:10.594
So, for you to say that,
it hits home, big time.

30:10.596 --> 30:14.097
So, my grandmother
passed on of...

30:14.099 --> 30:16.466
it started with emphysema,

30:16.468 --> 30:19.135
and the emphysema
led to bone cancer.

30:19.137 --> 30:21.371
- Oh. - And that's what
she passed on from

30:21.373 --> 30:22.872
- was bone cancer.
- Oh, wow.

30:22.874 --> 30:24.741
And she did pass away
in the house.

30:24.743 --> 30:26.776
Yes, both of them passed away
in the house.

30:26.778 --> 30:28.812
My grandfather passed away
in the kitchen,

30:28.814 --> 30:31.448
and my grandmother passed away
in what is now our bedroom.

30:31.450 --> 30:34.651
Would it be okay
if I showed Amy their pictures?

30:34.653 --> 30:36.119
- Sure, sure.
- You sure?

30:36.121 --> 30:37.554
Yeah.
It's be all right?

30:37.556 --> 30:40.256
I'm all right with you sharing.

30:40.258 --> 30:41.925
This is his Grandma.

30:41.927 --> 30:45.094
Mm. Okay.

30:45.096 --> 30:49.632
And this is his grandpa,
and that's him as a baby.

30:49.634 --> 30:50.700
Oh, okay.

30:50.702 --> 30:54.070
I did do a sketch
of the guy I met,

30:54.072 --> 30:59.409
but just sitting up on the bed.

31:01.745 --> 31:03.646
Oh, geez.

31:05.449 --> 31:07.950
That's your grandfather,
trust me.

31:09.853 --> 31:12.889
Oh, my gosh.

31:21.331 --> 31:24.000
I miss him.

31:24.002 --> 31:27.537
He watches the kids.

31:27.539 --> 31:30.039
I'm just glad to know

31:30.041 --> 31:33.376
that he, too,
watches over the little ones

31:33.378 --> 31:36.379
'cause that's how he was with me
when I was a little guy.

31:39.082 --> 31:42.151
And this is why
it's so important, really,

31:42.153 --> 31:44.220
for Joe to make this house
work for him.

31:44.222 --> 31:46.922
He just... he feels like
it's a tribute, really,

31:46.924 --> 31:48.124
to your grandparents.

31:48.126 --> 31:50.426
Yeah, and I just feel
that I have to pay

31:50.428 --> 31:51.861
a debt of gratitude to them.

31:51.863 --> 31:54.997
Okay, I have a few questions.

31:54.999 --> 31:58.167
How old are your children,
and what are their names?

31:58.169 --> 32:00.402
Madison, she's 10.

32:00.404 --> 32:04.039
Brooke Lynn is 8,
and Joey is 6.

32:04.041 --> 32:05.074
Okay.

32:05.076 --> 32:11.347
Um, so...
My walk was very active.

32:11.349 --> 32:19.188
So, I'm upstairs, and I went
into the room on the left.

32:19.190 --> 32:21.990
So, I go in there,
and I see a little boy,

32:21.992 --> 32:25.227
and he's crying
because there's something

32:25.229 --> 32:27.896
in the room,
and it was touching him.

32:27.898 --> 32:31.066
This was obviously
very disturbing,

32:31.068 --> 32:32.868
and I don't feel that this

32:32.870 --> 32:36.772
is a very good place
for children.

32:36.774 --> 32:39.608
So, I went into the other room,

32:39.610 --> 32:43.211
and what I saw there was, like,
a line of people out the door.

32:43.213 --> 32:45.614
So, initially,
there's this one woman.

32:45.616 --> 32:47.949
She's kneeling
at the side of the bed

32:47.951 --> 32:50.185
trying to talk
to this little girl,

32:50.187 --> 32:53.021
and she's begging her for help.

32:53.023 --> 32:55.390
And then there's
a line of dead people

32:55.392 --> 32:57.826
out the door
and going down the stairs,

32:57.828 --> 33:01.463
and all of them want help
to be moved on.

33:01.465 --> 33:03.698
And the young girl is living?

33:03.700 --> 33:04.733
Yes.

33:04.735 --> 33:06.635
Whether this child
knows it or not,

33:06.637 --> 33:07.669
she's a medium.

33:07.671 --> 33:11.373
And is actually helping people
in her sleep

33:11.375 --> 33:13.441
to, you know, move on.

33:13.443 --> 33:15.977
I Knew it.

33:15.979 --> 33:17.645
That's why this is so hard
on Sue.

33:17.647 --> 33:21.383
She actually thinks
Brooke Lynn's sensitive.

33:21.385 --> 33:25.186
I know that this is crazy,

33:25.188 --> 33:28.556
but Brooke Lynn wrote
this book a couple years ago

33:28.558 --> 33:32.026
out of nowhere that was called
"Blood drops Everywhere."

33:32.028 --> 33:34.629
And it kind of scared us.

33:34.631 --> 33:37.599
- It was pretty graphic.
- Yeah, okay.

33:37.601 --> 33:40.768
She was probably
in kindergarten, first grade.

33:40.770 --> 33:43.838
I mean, talking about somebody
being stabbed with a knife.

33:43.840 --> 33:49.510
Honestly, it's not unusual
for children who are mediums

33:49.512 --> 33:54.649
to act these things out
via dolls or writing stories

33:54.651 --> 33:58.619
that, you know, would be
more appropriate for an adult.

33:58.621 --> 34:01.322
Apparently, she probably knows
more than I do.

34:04.760 --> 34:06.828
You had a lot of stuff
on this walk.

34:06.830 --> 34:08.062
What else did you see?

34:08.063 --> 34:09.297
This is, you know,

34:09.299 --> 34:12.065
one of the things
that really bothered me.

34:12.068 --> 34:15.002
I saw this thing by the house,

34:15.004 --> 34:18.406
and it was, like,
trying to get into the house.

34:18.408 --> 34:19.607
It was odd.

34:19.609 --> 34:21.042
It was very, very tall.

34:21.043 --> 34:23.310
It was kind of hunched
by its neck,

34:23.312 --> 34:25.312
but it had a weird, long neck.

34:25.313 --> 34:27.514
It had, like,
a human-shaped head.

34:27.516 --> 34:31.185
It just really bothered me.

34:31.187 --> 34:33.219
It did not look human.

34:33.222 --> 34:36.724
I feel, like,
this draw to the window,

34:36.726 --> 34:40.761
and them being outside
and, like, looking in,

34:40.763 --> 34:42.295
making weird noises
and scratches.

34:42.297 --> 34:46.065
And I could see it had,
like, sharp teeth.

34:46.068 --> 34:47.835
Can they make noises
that they'll hear...

34:47.837 --> 34:50.504
like a knocking...
by any chance?

34:50.505 --> 34:51.938
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.

34:51.940 --> 34:54.041
- How about banging?
- Yeah.

34:54.043 --> 34:57.778
Which we've had numerous,
numerous encounters with,

34:57.780 --> 34:59.413
knocking and banging.

34:59.415 --> 35:01.648
Ooh.

35:01.650 --> 35:06.420
- I'm trying to figure out what the hell these
things look like. - Well, I did do a sketch.

35:06.422 --> 35:07.955
I'm dying to see this.

35:15.330 --> 35:18.065
Oh, get the [Bleep]
out of here.

35:40.468 --> 35:45.405
- I'm trying to figure out what the hell these
things look like. - Well, I did do a sketch.

35:45.407 --> 35:46.940
I'm dying to see this.

35:54.315 --> 35:56.816
Oh, get the [Bleep]
out of here.

36:09.697 --> 36:12.899
I'm never gonna get any sleep
in that house... never.

36:15.136 --> 36:19.973
She doesn't want to look at it,
and I'll explain why.

36:19.975 --> 36:21.574
When was it, last week?

36:21.576 --> 36:23.109
Ugh.

36:23.611 --> 36:26.579
Broad daylight,
and she says to me,

36:26.581 --> 36:28.614
"did you just see something
walk across the lawn?"

36:28.616 --> 36:32.351
I seen its head
up above the porch railing.

36:32.353 --> 36:34.620
A couple days later,
she says to me,

36:34.622 --> 36:36.388
"it must have been
pretty tall."

36:43.163 --> 36:44.263
You know what, babe,

36:44.265 --> 36:45.798
I'm gonna turn this around,
all right?

36:45.800 --> 36:47.566
This way,
you don't have to look at it.

36:49.437 --> 36:52.104
Let me ask you, what the [Bleep]
are these things?

36:52.106 --> 36:54.039
I don't think
I've ever seen you

36:54.041 --> 36:56.108
sketch something like that
before.

36:56.110 --> 36:58.177
- Were they ever human?
- No. Mnh-mnh.

36:58.179 --> 37:01.380
I think that these things
harmed children in the past.

37:01.382 --> 37:03.382
- Geez.
- Like, way back when.

37:03.384 --> 37:05.117
They're very old,

37:05.119 --> 37:08.353
and they're definitely focused
on your son.

37:08.355 --> 37:11.190
I think
it's what was touching him.

37:13.059 --> 37:15.060
Sue's been
physically touched twice.

37:15.062 --> 37:18.096
Describe that to Amy,
what it was like.

37:18.098 --> 37:20.766
It was just a rub.

37:20.768 --> 37:22.167
You know, like this.

37:22.169 --> 37:23.302
Flesh on flesh.

37:23.304 --> 37:24.536
The other one,

37:24.538 --> 37:26.438
it's a little difficult
for her to talk about,

37:26.440 --> 37:28.340
but they were together
on the couch,

37:28.342 --> 37:30.242
and she was inappropriately
touched.

37:30.244 --> 37:32.944
- Okay.
- There was nobody else there.

37:32.946 --> 37:35.680
It automatically triggered
just pure anger.

37:41.687 --> 37:44.222
Joe and Sue, I know you've heard
a lot tonight,

37:44.224 --> 37:48.126
and it wasn't easy to hear.

37:48.128 --> 37:50.462
But at least now you know
what's going on in your home.

37:50.464 --> 37:52.530
Big question is, though,
can you continue

37:52.532 --> 37:55.033
the legacy
of your grandparents, Joe,

37:55.035 --> 37:59.371
and stay here safely
with your wife and children?

37:59.373 --> 38:01.206
For that,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

38:07.713 --> 38:10.248
There's a lot going on here.

38:10.250 --> 38:12.684
Especially
because of Brooke Lynn.

38:12.686 --> 38:13.818
She's a medium.

38:13.820 --> 38:16.788
So what you're
gonna have there is, like,

38:16.790 --> 38:19.457
a lighthouse, almost,
in your case,

38:19.459 --> 38:22.527
where the dead are coming
to seek help

38:22.529 --> 38:24.562
from the living sensitives
in the house.

38:26.065 --> 38:28.833
Some of the dead on your
property don't want to leave,

38:28.835 --> 38:31.469
that's why she's gonna need
to learn about her abilities

38:31.471 --> 38:33.671
and to feel comfortable
with them.

38:33.673 --> 38:36.741
I would suggest opening
a line of communication

38:36.743 --> 38:39.977
with all the kids about
any experiences that they have.

38:39.979 --> 38:42.280
My suggestion is,

38:42.282 --> 38:44.148
let them all keep
dream journals,

38:44.150 --> 38:45.249
as well as you guys.

38:47.720 --> 38:51.722
I didn't even mention this
to nobody.

38:51.724 --> 38:55.560
Brooke Lynn just said that
a couple weeks ago.

38:55.562 --> 38:57.428
She wanted all of us
to get journals

38:57.430 --> 38:59.997
and write our dreams down.

38:59.999 --> 39:02.400
Honest to God.

39:06.672 --> 39:10.741
It's so weird.

39:10.743 --> 39:12.576
She wants to talk about it.

39:12.578 --> 39:14.445
Sounds like she's
ahead of the game.

39:14.447 --> 39:16.046
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

39:16.048 --> 39:19.517
All right, the next thing
is the need to protect.

39:19.519 --> 39:22.019
Since native Americans
are guarding your land,

39:22.021 --> 39:24.021
I suggest you contact
a local shaman

39:24.023 --> 39:25.289
who can help you remove

39:25.291 --> 39:27.725
the dead that have been
attracted to your property.

39:27.727 --> 39:31.161
In the meantime...
this is black salt.

39:31.163 --> 39:33.163
Take just a little bit of this

39:33.165 --> 39:36.900
and put it at the entrance
of each bedroom door.

39:36.902 --> 39:39.937
This will create
a protective barrier.

39:39.939 --> 39:41.872
The next thing
I would like you to do

39:41.874 --> 39:47.911
is to build a stone fence
following that property line.

39:47.913 --> 39:50.347
So, this stone wall
you're talking about,

39:50.349 --> 39:52.149
- is this keep the bad out?
- Yeah.

39:52.151 --> 39:54.384
Is it gonna keep
that thing you drew out?

39:54.386 --> 39:56.253
No, I don't think so.

39:56.255 --> 40:00.424
So, no matter what,
they're gonna be there?

40:00.426 --> 40:01.558
Yeah.

40:01.560 --> 40:03.360
Yeah.

40:03.362 --> 40:06.463
Well... ugh.

40:06.465 --> 40:08.932
You have a potential situation

40:08.934 --> 40:12.669
that I personally
have never encountered before.

40:12.671 --> 40:17.174
When I was doing the sketch
of the thing that I saw,

40:17.176 --> 40:20.510
I started to get really upset
by it,

40:20.512 --> 40:24.080
and the reason why was because

40:24.082 --> 40:27.684
I was being told that, in fact,

40:27.686 --> 40:30.954
it was some type
of alien creature.

40:33.091 --> 40:34.391
I know, it's a lot.

40:34.393 --> 40:37.060
And they're trying,
through subtle ways,

40:37.062 --> 40:42.098
to have the living people
get out of the area.

40:42.100 --> 40:46.903
I've never encountered anything
like this in my entire career.

40:46.905 --> 40:49.973
I'm not exactly sure
what these things are

40:49.975 --> 40:52.909
or where they're from,
but it's possible

40:52.911 --> 40:56.346
they're from another world
or another dimension.

40:56.348 --> 40:58.715
I can introduce you
to some experts,

40:58.717 --> 41:02.318
and it's very possible
that they'll have suggestions

41:02.320 --> 41:07.223
as far as how to keep
those suckers away.

41:07.225 --> 41:10.526
What about his grandparents?

41:10.528 --> 41:12.762
They're good.
They're gonna hang out.

41:12.764 --> 41:13.596
Mm.

41:13.598 --> 41:15.164
What are you thinking about?

41:15.166 --> 41:18.034
It's just craziness.

41:18.036 --> 41:19.902
It's a lot of stuff, huh?

41:19.904 --> 41:22.305
Yeah, no doubt.
No doubt.

41:25.509 --> 41:26.576
So, Joe, I got to ask.

41:26.578 --> 41:29.112
Are you gonna take Amy's advice
and do what she says?

41:29.114 --> 41:30.280
Absolutely.

41:30.282 --> 41:32.582
I mean, you know,
all I'm looking for as a dad

41:32.584 --> 41:37.754
is just, you know,
keep my wife and kids safe.

41:37.756 --> 41:39.706
I want to take her advice.

41:39.708 --> 41:41.975
I want to do what we can do

41:41.977 --> 41:44.944
to eliminate
all of this chaos...

41:46.180 --> 41:52.619
And hope that those creatures
will go.

41:53.121 --> 41:56.756
I wish I had better news
for Joe and Sue.

41:56.758 --> 42:00.126
I know if they build a barrier
and work with Brooke Lynn,

42:00.128 --> 42:01.761
their lives should improve.

42:01.763 --> 42:04.730
But whether they can continue
to co-exist

42:04.732 --> 42:06.265
with those creatures,

42:06.267 --> 42:08.801
unfortunately,
remains to be seen.
