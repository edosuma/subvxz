Chloe around the country like that.</i>

Why don't you throw down some roots?</i>

to make a real friend and have a life.</i>

<i>What do you think?
Oh, does she still have that pink hair?</i>

01:49.808 --> 01:53.558
Yes. She was trying to fit in
with friends. I gotta pick my battles.

Look at the little hats and beards.
They're garden gnomes.

Then why aren't they in the garden?

03:48.308 --> 03:51.975
Did you see the piano downstairs?
The last owners must have left it.

03:52.183 --> 03:56.142
New house, new-ish piano.

Did you bring those tiny Santa statues
up here?

05:57.892 --> 06:00.142
Gnomes, Chloe,
and I haven't touched them.

06:00.933 --> 06:02.475
Are you sure?

06:02.642 --> 06:03.933
Of course I'm sure.

Do you remember which box
we packed the auto vac in?

Never mind, found it.

06:08.350 --> 06:12.267
If you see any trash up there,
bring it down. This place is a mess.

06:22.725 --> 06:23.558
Hey!

06:25.392 --> 06:28.600
Glad to see someone's finally
moving into Frankenstein's castle.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.725
That was rude. That's just what
some of the kids at school call it.

06:34.850 --> 06:37.475
Which, when you think about it,
is kind of a compliment.

06:37.558 --> 06:41.433
Frankenstein was a brilliant scientist.
Fatally flawed, but brilliant.

06:42.017 --> 06:44.433
Okay, this is going terrible.

06:44.517 --> 06:46.267
Come on, Liam. Come on!

06:47.475 --> 06:50.892
The house has got great bones.
Not that you don't know that.

06:50.975 --> 06:55.808
You know, I call it more of a Victorian,
post-modern, classical abandon.

06:55.892 --> 06:58.933
Not Frankenstein at all, but...
Hi, I'm Liam!

06:59.767 --> 07:02.308
Strong and silent. I like it.

07:02.392 --> 07:04.517
Also, loving the pink hair.

07:05.100 --> 07:08.058
Hey, may I have one
of your free garden gnomes?

07:11.392 --> 07:12.808
Is that a yes?

07:14.808 --> 07:16.100
I think that's a yes.

07:18.350 --> 07:20.850
This place
is finally coming together, huh?

07:21.100 --> 07:25.475
How was that Combat Captain?
Did you capture all the borks and glorks?

07:25.975 --> 07:29.433
Mom, borks and glorks? Not a thing.

07:29.683 --> 07:32.683
Plus, my team moved on without me anyway.

07:41.017 --> 07:43.308
First day of school tomorrow.
That's exciting.

07:43.517 --> 07:45.392
First day... again.

07:46.142 --> 07:48.267
Yeah. Again.

07:49.142 --> 07:51.183
Who was that boy
you were talking to outside?

07:51.267 --> 07:54.933
- Ew! That guy was the worst.
- I thought he was kind of cute.

07:55.017 --> 07:56.100
Mom!

07:57.058 --> 08:00.933
- You're going to make new friends here.
- It doesn't matter.

08:01.350 --> 08:03.058
We're just gonna move again,

08:03.225 --> 08:05.642
and then my new friends
will forget about me, too.

08:05.725 --> 08:07.642
But you're sending them texts
all the time.

08:07.725 --> 08:09.933
Yeah, sending, but not receiving.

08:10.142 --> 08:12.725
I know it's been hard
moving around so much.

08:12.933 --> 08:16.392
But that's what this house is for.
A place to settle down.

08:16.725 --> 08:17.642
I know.

08:18.517 --> 08:19.558
I'll be fine.

08:20.933 --> 08:23.100
I'm trying, Chlo. I really am.

08:24.100 --> 08:26.892

It took forever...

Mom?

10:03.683 --> 10:07.142
Hey, do you know anything
about an attic in this house?

10:08.433 --> 10:10.308
The realtor didn't mention anything.

10:11.933 --> 10:16.225
And since we bought the house, that means
we own everything inside of it, right?

10:16.350 --> 10:18.017
I suppose, yes.

10:19.017 --> 10:20.017

19:36.058 --> 19:39.225
They never believe me.
Get me a status check on Pinky.

19:40.558 --> 19:43.017
Pocket, put that hammer away.
You look terrifying!

19:45.225 --> 19:48.308
- She must have hit the snooze...
- 'Cause she's passed out.

19:48.392 --> 19:50.933
Guys, she's fine.
Check her for the Keystone!

19:53.392 --> 19:54.642
[laughs]

19:56.933 --> 19:58.433
Ah, shave my beard!

19:58.517 --> 20:01.017
- It's a no-go...
- On the Keystone.

20:01.142 --> 20:03.600
Put her to bed.
We'll question her in the morning.

20:05.725 --> 20:09.017
Until we get the Keystone back,
we're on high alert. Which means,

20:09.100 --> 20:11.267
no poker playing, no whittling,

20:11.392 --> 20:13.850
no singing of those sea shanties.

20:13.933 --> 20:15.392
It's all business.

20:15.475 --> 20:17.017
[clatter from kitchen]

20:23.267 --> 20:25.142
I don't like the look of that.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.975
This is worse than I thought.

20:30.725 --> 20:33.225
You better know
where that Keystone is, Pinky.

20:33.725 --> 20:34.725
Or it's the end.

20:35.642 --> 20:36.850
Of everything.

20:46.225 --> 20:47.058
No.

20:47.392 --> 20:48.433
No.

20:49.767 --> 20:51.808
Santas... Giant...

20:53.392 --> 20:54.517
Hammer...

20:54.933 --> 20:56.683
it's not Christmas.

20:57.642 --> 20:58.600
Gnomes!

20:59.183 --> 21:01.225
- Who were you talking to, hon?
- What?

21:02.058 --> 21:03.517
No one. I was...

21:03.600 --> 21:07.183
I'm sorry I missed you last night.
Traffic was unbelievable.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.600
- What's wrong, Chlo?
- I...

21:10.225 --> 21:13.142
Nothing. I had a bad dream.

21:13.308 --> 21:14.308
Oh, sweetie.

21:14.850 --> 21:17.517
Listen, I have to fly to the city
for the day.

21:17.600 --> 21:20.100
What?
So, I'm gonna be home alone?

21:20.392 --> 21:22.975
The dance is tonight.
I wanted you to meet my friends.

21:23.058 --> 21:25.558
You'll be fine. I won't be too late.

21:25.642 --> 21:28.017
- [horn honks]
- That's my cab. I'll see you tonight

21:28.725 --> 21:30.975
And thanks
for cleaning up the house last night.

22:12.017 --> 22:15.433
And... with the speed of a serpent,

22:15.933 --> 22:17.433
the trap is sprung.

22:17.933 --> 22:19.392
Now!

22:19.475 --> 22:20.642
Go!

22:20.933 --> 22:22.850
What... What is going on?

22:27.142 --> 22:28.267
Who are you?

22:28.767 --> 22:30.892
I'll ask the questions, Pinky.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.433
- Where's the Keystone?
- The what?

22:33.558 --> 22:36.100
"The what?"
You stole it from our headquarters.

22:36.183 --> 22:38.767
Powerful glowing green gem?
Where is it?

22:39.142 --> 22:42.808
And don't even think
about lying to us gnomes!

22:43.142 --> 22:45.892
This cannot be happening right now.

22:45.975 --> 22:49.350
We need that Keystone
back in this house now!

22:49.433 --> 22:52.558
It's the only thing
that can stop the portals.

22:52.642 --> 22:56.600
For be'ith if the sacred Keystone
remains unfound,

22:56.725 --> 22:59.725
a darkness will unfold across this realm.

22:59.892 --> 23:01.975
Darkness means dead.

23:02.058 --> 23:04.350
Wait, is this because I gave away
your dwarf buddy?

23:04.433 --> 23:07.517
Dwarf? Maybe we should put you
on the side of the road.

23:07.975 --> 23:11.392
For sale! Sassy girl: cheap.

23:11.475 --> 23:13.058
Sorry. Santa...

23:13.308 --> 23:15.267
- Elf thing.
- Okay

23:15.933 --> 23:18.850
Elves wear green hats.

23:19.142 --> 23:21.517
We are gnomes.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.433
Okay, I can fix this.

23:23.683 --> 23:25.767
Phone, where can I buy a gnome?

23:25.850 --> 23:28.433
We need the Keystone. The Keystone!

23:29.392 --> 23:32.350
[phone] <i>Keys. Keys 24 hour locksmith.</i>

23:32.433 --> 23:35.558
- I hear a lady speaking...
- But where's she creeping?

23:35.725 --> 23:39.767
Who is that tiny woman?
And how did she come to inhabit the box?

23:39.850 --> 23:42.142
The girl is a witch!

23:42.225 --> 23:43.350
No, I'm not.

23:43.433 --> 23:44.975
Attack the magic box!

23:48.517 --> 23:49.850
<i>What is your question?</i>

23:50.058 --> 23:53.183
I shall release you from your bonds,
captive maiden!

23:59.183 --> 24:01.058
Whoa. Stop!

24:02.642 --> 24:07.017
Just don't smash my phone, I'm expecting
some very important text messages.

24:08.433 --> 24:10.267
I don't even know what that means!

24:10.350 --> 24:13.308
We're too busy protecting you
from all the Troggs.

24:13.392 --> 24:16.808
- What the heck are Troggs?
- You met one last night!

24:16.892 --> 24:20.308
They're small and round,
with razor sharp teeth,

24:20.683 --> 24:22.808
and always hungry.

24:23.392 --> 24:24.892
So, it did happen.

24:24.975 --> 24:27.100
You defended this house honorably.

24:27.475 --> 24:28.975
Yeah, well, for a human.

24:29.058 --> 24:32.350
But the only thing that will keep them
from invading our world

24:32.433 --> 24:36.017
is the Keystone.
And without it, we will be overrun.

24:36.100 --> 24:39.642
If this Keystone is so important,
then I'll just bring it back.

24:39.850 --> 24:41.517
It's safe and sound...

24:41.600 --> 24:43.808
in my locker at school.

24:44.350 --> 24:48.892
- So, if you untie me, I can go get it.
- If those Troggs were to escape,

24:49.100 --> 24:50.850
a ruinous darkness

24:50.933 --> 24:55.475
of a thousand years...

25:04.183 --> 25:05.183
My phone!

25:09.683 --> 25:13.767
Trogg's headed for the basement.
Grab your oozers! Go!

25:13.850 --> 25:16.600
- Wait! Aren't you going to untie me?
- Yeah.

25:17.350 --> 25:19.100
No. I don't trust you.

25:19.725 --> 25:21.767
I need my phone!

25:33.975 --> 25:35.058
Positions.

25:38.392 --> 25:40.725
Pocket, open the door.

25:49.475 --> 25:51.475
[barking]

25:52.975 --> 25:54.725
[footsteps approaching]

25:57.350 --> 25:59.558
- Pinky!
- I can't go anywhere without my phone.

26:03.558 --> 26:07.058
So, your ooze thingies
can kill that thing, right?

26:07.225 --> 26:11.892
Ooze doesn't kill them. It just sends them
back to where they came from, okay?

26:12.058 --> 26:13.767
How nice. Where does my phone go?

26:15.100 --> 26:17.100
[growling]

26:25.308 --> 26:27.142
- Ooze him!
- Ah!

26:35.350 --> 26:37.850
You... shall.. not...

26:41.517 --> 26:42.392
My back.

26:42.475 --> 26:43.558
[doorbell rings]

26:43.642 --> 26:44.892
Now what?

26:48.183 --> 26:50.350
That's the kid that stole Charlie.

26:50.433 --> 26:52.683
Tell your boyfriend to give him back.

26:52.767 --> 26:55.267
Okay, but just so we're clear.
He's not my boyfriend!

26:55.433 --> 26:56.558
Now!

26:57.683 --> 27:00.600
Good morning.
Wanna walk to school together?

27:00.683 --> 27:02.683
[distant clattering, snarling]

27:04.642 --> 27:06.433
I think I'm coming down with something.

27:06.517 --> 27:08.850
Must be that virus
everyone's been talking about.

27:08.933 --> 27:11.183
- Hey, I'm going to need that gnome back.
- Oh!

27:11.267 --> 27:15.225
My grandma'll be happy to hear that.
She says he's been following her around.

27:15.308 --> 27:18.392
A little garden gnome. She's so weird.

27:18.517 --> 27:21.308
What? Crazy. Just bring him back.

27:21.392 --> 27:22.225
Okay, bye.

27:22.308 --> 27:26.017
Wait! Since you're sick, does that mean
you're not going to the dance?

27:26.100 --> 27:29.058
No, I'm going. I'm not like sick-sick.

27:29.142 --> 27:30.517
I'm more like sick-ish.

27:31.392 --> 27:32.600
Just bring the gnome.

27:39.017 --> 27:42.267
My friends are texting me!
Give me back my phone!

27:46.642 --> 27:48.475
Nothing... gets...

27:48.850 --> 27:49.975
between...

27:50.558 --> 27:52.558
me... and...

27:52.725 --> 27:54.642
my... phone!

27:54.725 --> 27:56.475
[phone ringing]

28:00.642 --> 28:02.058
Oh no, it could be Brittany.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.892
Phone, answer the call on speaker.

28:06.392 --> 28:08.308
[Mom] <i>Hello? Chloe!</i>

28:08.642 --> 28:10.892
<i>Just checking to make sure
you got to school okay.</i>

28:11.850 --> 28:13.725
How many maidens are in that box?

28:14.392 --> 28:17.892
- <i>I can't hear you too well, hon.</i>
- Mom! Don't hang up.

28:17.975 --> 28:21.392
You put your mother in that phone?
That's low, Pinky.

28:21.475 --> 28:23.600
<i>There's a storm here. It's very possible</i>

28:23.683 --> 28:25.808
<i>my flight will be delayed
until later tonight.</i>

28:25.933 --> 28:30.100
I really think you should be here tonight.
I'm not so sure about this house.

28:30.183 --> 28:32.683
- <i>All old houses are weird.</i>
- No.

28:32.767 --> 28:35.267
Mom, this house is really, really weird.

28:36.600 --> 28:40.433
<i>Sorry, honey, it's a really bad
connection, you're all garbled.</i>

28:40.767 --> 28:41.683
Mom!

28:41.892 --> 28:43.725
- <i>I'll try you later. Bye.</i>
- No!

28:46.017 --> 28:47.017
Give me that!

28:59.017 --> 29:01.017
Art thee damaged, young lady?

29:01.725 --> 29:02.683
Not really.

29:06.517 --> 29:08.517
[plays classical piano]

29:08.600 --> 29:10.600
[Trogg wailing]

29:12.933 --> 29:13.892
They hate this.

29:18.225 --> 29:19.933
- Your gnome, m'lady.
- Thanks.

29:21.517 --> 29:24.725
- What's going on in there?
- Nothing, just playing Combat Captain.

29:24.808 --> 29:27.600
I play Combat Captain every day.
That is not...

29:27.683 --> 29:28.975
Yeah, you're right. 'K, bye!

29:52.683 --> 29:54.892
What is going on in here?

29:56.225 --> 29:57.183
Oh, boy.

29:58.725 --> 30:00.725
- Gnomes?
- Yep.

30:01.642 --> 30:02.767
Troggs?

30:03.350 --> 30:04.517
Yep.

30:10.392 --> 30:12.225
I can't breathe! I can't brea...

30:12.725 --> 30:14.517
I'm gonna throw up! I'm gon...

30:16.558 --> 30:18.683
All right, guys, come on out.

30:24.475 --> 30:25.933
Charlie!

30:26.433 --> 30:28.433
Charlie!

30:28.517 --> 30:29.725
Gnomes!

30:31.058 --> 30:34.017
- We thought our trio...
- Was down to a duo.

30:35.308 --> 30:36.433
Gnome, gnome!

30:36.517 --> 30:37.767
Like I said,

30:37.850 --> 30:40.392
they're alive.

30:56.433 --> 30:59.975
Watch it, skinny. We've taken down
mushrooms bigger than you.

31:00.142 --> 31:02.850
- Yeah.
- Okay, this was interesting, but...

31:03.350 --> 31:06.392
I have a bio test, need to look over
the old flash cards...

31:06.475 --> 31:08.517
No one is going anywhere!

31:08.600 --> 31:12.058
Just let me out of here and I can get
that gem... or Keystone back.

31:12.142 --> 31:14.517
- Me, too. I can help get the key.
- No way.

31:14.600 --> 31:17.850
I trust you about as far as I can
throw you with my teeny tiny arms.

31:17.933 --> 31:19.975
You go to school and get the Keystone.

31:20.308 --> 31:24.225
Then you can have your boyfriend back.
Floss him, gnomes.

31:26.517 --> 31:27.767
Watch yourself, Liam.

31:27.850 --> 31:30.683
These little guys are cranky and mean.

31:31.933 --> 31:35.142
- But you get to skip school.
- But I like school.

31:39.225 --> 31:40.642
Hey, guys.

31:40.725 --> 31:44.517
New girl, did you totally,
like, skip classes this morning?

31:45.058 --> 31:47.183
I think I have to skip all day, actually.

31:47.267 --> 31:48.850
Too epic.

31:49.308 --> 31:52.392
Listen, so awkward,
but I need that necklace back.

31:53.850 --> 31:57.017
- That's literally so funny, NG.
- The funniest, B.

31:57.558 --> 32:00.350
Right? But I'm kind of being serious,
literally.

32:02.683 --> 32:03.975
It's at my house.

32:05.475 --> 32:06.642
I'll be right back.

32:09.683 --> 32:11.225
[Chloe screaming]

32:13.308 --> 32:17.183
Okay, no problem
about that necklace thing.

32:17.350 --> 32:19.267
Can you just bring it
to the dance tonight?

32:19.350 --> 32:22.100
- You should totes come to yoga with me.
- For sure!

32:22.183 --> 32:25.350
- I've always wanted to...
- Yeah. We're done talking.

32:29.475 --> 32:30.475
Hello?

32:31.725 --> 32:32.725
Liam?

32:33.642 --> 32:35.100
Tiny Santas?

32:41.058 --> 32:42.017
[Liam] Chloe!

32:43.100 --> 32:44.100
You're back!

32:44.767 --> 32:46.308
How did you? Where did you get...

32:49.850 --> 32:50.725
Liam?

32:51.850 --> 32:55.058
Check out this oozer. The gnomes
were actually stealing my water guns

32:55.142 --> 32:57.683
from my house all these years.
Bunch of sneaks!

32:57.767 --> 32:59.933
We talked about it,
reached an understanding.

33:00.017 --> 33:02.183
- So where's the Keystone?
- Well...

33:02.267 --> 33:06.142
We caught two Troggs while you were gone.
Oh, and I almost got eaten.

33:06.267 --> 33:08.517
Twice. Chloe, where's the Keystone?

33:08.600 --> 33:10.517
Yeah, I ran into a little snag.

33:12.475 --> 33:14.808
I lent it to Brittany.
She didn't have it at school.

33:14.892 --> 33:17.725
But it's okay. She promised
she'd give it back after the dance.

33:17.850 --> 33:20.725
There are monsters attacking your house!

33:20.808 --> 33:22.808
Our savior hath returned!

33:22.892 --> 33:26.642
Now, I shall restore the Keystone
forthwith.

33:28.225 --> 33:30.225
She lent it to a girl
who won't give it back.

33:31.683 --> 33:34.058
I take back all the nice things I said.

33:34.142 --> 33:36.017
I'm sorry, but I'm new.

33:36.100 --> 33:40.017
I'm trying to make friends, and Brittany
asked to borrow it. And she's cool.

33:41.392 --> 33:43.350
Oh, okay. Hold on.

33:44.017 --> 33:45.683
You lent out the Keystone

33:46.142 --> 33:48.808
because you wanted to make friends?

33:49.850 --> 33:50.683
Yes.

33:51.308 --> 33:52.183
Missed.

33:58.433 --> 34:00.475
No! I'm sick of these humans.

34:00.683 --> 34:03.892
They don't care about stopping the Troggs,
then why should I?

34:04.058 --> 34:05.767
Go ahead, take the house.

34:06.142 --> 34:07.975
I'm out! <i>¡Adiós!</i>

34:08.058 --> 34:09.391
- Wait!
- Farewell.

34:09.475 --> 34:11.558
- I can't do this.
- Good night.

That's a code red! Fall back!

Everyone in, come on. You, too, Pinky.

36:11.350 --> 36:12.350
What's happening?

36:18.017 --> 36:21.350
All right, boys, keep your eyes peeled
for any portal activity.

36:21.433 --> 36:23.725
Locking us inside with the Troggs?

36:24.017 --> 36:25.933
Yeah, sure, that's a great plan.

36:26.017 --> 36:29.767
What's your plan, Pinky? You failed
at getting the Keystone, and...

36:32.517 --> 36:37.017
until the situation is contained,
no one enters or exits.

36:38.142 --> 36:39.975
I have a dance to get to.

36:40.058 --> 36:41.433
Quick question.

36:42.850 --> 36:44.517
Why are the Troggs here?

36:48.975 --> 36:51.350
Well, quite simply, my boy.

36:51.850 --> 36:53.517
For your destruction.

36:57.142 --> 36:59.933
Many, many years ago,

37:00.225 --> 37:03.183
long before humans walked the earth,

37:03.517 --> 37:08.267
<i>we gnomes made this land
a green, fertile place.</i>

37:09.142 --> 37:13.475
<i>Then one dark day, the Troggs invaded.</i>

37:15.100 --> 37:18.642
<i>Using a magic crystal,
they opened a portal...</i>

37:20.475 --> 37:22.892
<i>and swarmed into our world.</i>

37:24.850 --> 37:29.392
They became our mortal enemies.
We gnomes grew life

37:29.475 --> 37:31.892
<i>and the Troggs devoured it.</i>

37:32.850 --> 37:35.642
The insatiable beasts ate everything!

37:36.183 --> 37:37.975
<i>Using our own magic,</i>

37:38.058 --> 37:41.392
<i>we beat back the Troggs
into their own dimension.</i>

37:41.642 --> 37:45.517
And then some genius human
decided to build this house

37:45.600 --> 37:48.725
directly over the spot
where they first came out.

37:49.808 --> 37:53.600
<i>On top of an intersection
of time and space...</i>

37:56.475 --> 38:00.600
<i>a doorway of endless portals
connected our worlds.</i>

38:01.475 --> 38:03.517
Yeah, the realtor left that part out.

38:03.600 --> 38:07.600
<i>With the Keystone, we were able
to control the portals from opening</i>

38:07.683 --> 38:10.433
<i>and protect the world from destruction.</i>

38:10.808 --> 38:15.183
We six, with our fearless leader Zamfeer,
took a sacred oath

38:15.267 --> 38:18.392
to guard this house, just in case.

38:18.475 --> 38:21.475
- In case of what?
- Oh, I don't know.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.975
Say some kid with mixed up priorities

38:24.058 --> 38:27.517
stumbled upon the Keystone
and decided it would make a nice necklace

38:27.600 --> 38:30.558
to give away to a girl
she thought was cool.

38:33.600 --> 38:35.600
I didn't ask for any of this.

38:36.142 --> 38:37.808
I never wanted to move here.

38:38.433 --> 38:39.600
I hate this house.

- Portal opening in Sector R-4!
- The basement again.

39:07.558 --> 39:08.433
Stand back.

39:09.517 --> 39:12.350
Whatever gets sucked in there
doesn't come back.

39:15.808 --> 39:17.433
Is he okay?

39:18.100 --> 39:20.725
Where six are before you now,

39:21.017 --> 39:24.058
there once stood seven.

39:24.600 --> 39:27.267
- Well, who's missing?
- Zamfeer.

39:27.975 --> 39:29.183
Our leader.

39:29.558 --> 39:33.933
He journeyed alone
into the depths of the Trogg world

39:34.100 --> 39:36.183
to destroy it forever.

39:37.433 --> 39:38.808
He never returned.

39:43.558 --> 39:46.267
Then we'll just have to get the Keystone
back from Brittany.

39:46.350 --> 39:47.350
Yeah, Liam's right.

39:47.433 --> 39:51.017
I have to get out of this house to get
to the dance... to get to the Keystone,

39:51.100 --> 39:53.933
that's why I need to get out.
Definitely not the dance.

39:54.017 --> 39:54.850
Okay.

39:55.267 --> 39:57.767
I'll lift the lockdown. Go to the dance.

39:57.850 --> 40:00.225
- Yes!
- And get the Keystone.

40:00.308 --> 40:03.308
We won't be able to restart the lockdown,
but we will contain...

40:04.142 --> 40:05.308
What are you doing?

40:06.475 --> 40:07.308
What?

40:08.517 --> 40:12.183
So, ooze, what is it?
Don't exactly know.

40:12.642 --> 40:17.433
Why does it work? Couldn't tell you.
Where does it come from? This plant.

40:17.558 --> 40:20.517
We only have as much ooze
as this plant can produce.

40:20.642 --> 40:24.142
Who knows how long it will last.
And when it's gone...

40:25.892 --> 40:26.892
It's gone.

40:29.350 --> 40:31.975
That plant makes a horrible stink, huh?

40:32.100 --> 40:34.100
I lay claim to that foul stench.

40:34.183 --> 40:36.933
All this action
fills me with a mighty wind.

40:37.017 --> 40:39.975
[farts] Ah, mighty wind indeed.

40:42.892 --> 40:45.683
Okay. We should be able
to keep things in check.

Sorry! Texting with Britt. How long do you
think the Trogg oozing thing's gonna take?

No, she left it at home.
Clashed with her outfit.

50:00.558 --> 50:02.808
- What?
- I know, right?

50:02.892 --> 50:05.058
- I think it would have looked great.
- Chloe!

50:05.142 --> 50:07.600
We've got less than an hour
to get back to the house.

50:07.683 --> 50:09.975

50:10.058 --> 50:13.100
Liam, take a chill pill.
It's gonna be fine.

50:58.017 --> 51:00.058
What is happening?

51:00.558 --> 51:03.767
You need to go home right now
and get Chloe's necklace.

51:08.142 --> 51:11.142
No wonder New Girl's
been so desperate for it.

51:11.433 --> 51:14.475
It's a gift... from her boyfriend.

51:15.808 --> 51:18.267
Ew, no! He's not my boyfriend.

51:19.100 --> 51:19.975

Ew?

51:21.808 --> 51:23.267
Liam, go home!

51:26.100 --> 51:28.017

52:37.392 --> 52:39.350
Chloe... couldn't get it.

52:40.600 --> 52:42.183
How much worse can it get?

52:47.600 --> 52:48.433
Liam!

52:58.517 --> 53:00.433
New Girl, you're still here.

53:00.517 --> 53:04.308
- Did you get rid of your boyfriend?
- I want my necklace back now.

53:05.392 --> 53:07.225
- Chill.
- I'm very chill!

53:07.350 --> 53:09.100
Is this girl for real right now?

53:09.558 --> 53:12.433
I lent my necklace to you
because I thought we could be friends.

53:12.517 --> 53:15.475
But you know what? I don't wanna
be friends with someone like you.

53:16.058 --> 53:19.100
Even if I still had it,
I wouldn't give it back.

53:19.850 --> 53:23.267
- What does that mean?
- I tossed it. Supes ugly.

53:24.267 --> 53:26.517
You... you threw away my necklace?

53:32.725 --> 53:34.433
Liam was so right about you.

53:34.517 --> 53:38.100
And I was wrong about you, NG.
You're a loser.

53:38.183 --> 53:40.433
Just like your loser boyfriend.

If you call him a loser again,
I'm gonna go full blow gnome on you.

through all of it.

if we're not friends anymore.

01:08:31.017 --> 01:08:34.017

01:08:37.433 --> 01:08:38.308
Well...

01:08:38.933 --> 01:08:40.725
look what I still have.

01:08:41.183 --> 01:08:42.850
I think I'll give it to...

01:08:43.850 --> 01:08:45.433
my cat.

01:08:45.558 --> 01:08:47.767
You do that. I don't need it anymore.

01:08:47.850 --> 01:08:50.808

You listen to everything...

[thud]

01:08:57.683 --> 01:09:00.975

- We did.

01:09:20.183 --> 01:09:23.558

I never liked you.

01:09:23.642 --> 01:09:25.725

01:10:00.892 --> 01:10:03.058
Game over, man. Game over.

01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:08.933

01:10:09.183 --> 01:10:10.350

01:11:52.225 --> 01:11:53.725
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

01:11:56.725 --> 01:11:57.558
Oh, no!

01:11:59.308 --> 01:12:01.517
Chloe, what are we gonna do?

01:12:06.017 --> 01:12:08.058
You can do it, Chloe!

01:12:08.558 --> 01:12:10.642
- You go, girl!
- Help!

01:12:11.475 --> 01:12:13.308
New Girl! I'm sorry!

01:12:13.392 --> 01:12:15.058
I'm sorry for everything.

01:12:15.808 --> 01:12:17.850

back to where he came from!

01:12:32.517 --> 01:12:36.517
She's gonna do better than that.
She's blowing it up for good!

01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:39.558
Go, girl, go!

01:12:39.642 --> 01:12:41.350
This is my house.

01:12:42.725 --> 01:12:44.600
And you've gotta go.

01:12:54.392 --> 01:12:55.808
- Chloe!
- Pinky!

01:12:59.267 --> 01:13:01.183
- Quick, up the chimney!
- Huzzah!

01:13:05.892 --> 01:13:07.392

01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:42.225
Chlo?

01:13:44.350 --> 01:13:45.308
Mom.

01:13:45.517 --> 01:13:47.308
I tried calling all night.

01:13:47.725 --> 01:13:49.642
I found this in the bathroom?

01:13:51.433 --> 01:13:53.142
What happened?

01:14:03.475 --> 01:14:04.433
Chlo?

01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:08.433
Are you okay?

01:14:10.433 --> 01:14:13.267
- Mom, I want to stay.
- Okay, sure.

01:14:13.683 --> 01:14:16.475
- I'll let school know you're not feel...
- No. I mean here.

01:14:16.933 --> 01:14:18.975
In this house. I...

01:14:19.642 --> 01:14:21.017
I really like it here.

01:14:21.933 --> 01:14:22.975
Feels like...

01:14:24.433 --> 01:14:25.433
home.

01:14:35.308 --> 01:14:36.308
I'm fine.

01:14:42.183 --> 01:14:44.850
Shave my beard!
I gotta get ready for school!

01:14:47.183 --> 01:14:48.183
Hey, Mom?

01:14:51.642 --> 01:14:52.642
I love you.

01:14:58.517 --> 01:15:00.850
Then there's no room for zucchini.

01:15:00.933 --> 01:15:05.600
I spent 50 years talking to Troggs
covered in poop.

01:15:05.725 --> 01:15:07.183
I think I earned it.

01:15:07.267 --> 01:15:10.433
Tomatoes or zucchini,
it matters not to me.

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:14.433
I simply wish for a small patch
to plant my petunias.

01:15:14.725 --> 01:15:17.892
No. The tomato plants have to go here.

01:15:17.975 --> 01:15:20.392
There's no room for flowers.

01:15:20.475 --> 01:15:23.267
- I want my petunias!
- Now, hold on.

01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:26.142
- Gotta decide if we want 'em row by row...
- [doorbell rings]

01:15:26.225 --> 01:15:27.975
...or just scatter the seeds.

01:15:34.350 --> 01:15:35.225
Yo, Liam.

01:15:35.308 --> 01:15:38.267
- Let me get your opinion on something.
- Okay.

01:15:38.350 --> 01:15:42.225
- I think I'm ready to change out the pink.
- Oh, would you really?

01:15:42.308 --> 01:15:43.350
I would.

01:15:44.017 --> 01:15:45.142
What color?

01:15:45.225 --> 01:15:47.558
I don't know,
something a little brown...

01:15:47.808 --> 01:15:49.225
a little blond.

01:15:49.850 --> 01:15:51.850
A little more me.
