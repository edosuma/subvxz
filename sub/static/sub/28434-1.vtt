00:35.153 --> 00:37.285
<font color="#00FFFF"> At least she's comfortable.</font>

00:37.286 --> 00:39.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah, there are worse ways to go.</font>

00:39.351 --> 00:41.885
Well, this is it. <font color="#00FFFF">You're telling me!</font>
<font color="#11FF11"> You can say that again.</font>

00:41.886 --> 00:44.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> Quiet. </font>Shh.

00:44.351 --> 00:46.350
I think it's happening.

00:46.351 --> 00:47.751
<font color="#FFFF00"> Stand by.</font>

Oh, I do hope she stays.

<font color="#FFFF00"> I can't see anything.
Can you lift me up a bit?</font>

<font color="#FFFF00"> Argh!</font>

01:07.352 --> 01:09.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, not this again.</font>

01:09.351 --> 01:11.285
<font color="#11FF11"> Who are you?</font>

01:11.286 --> 01:14.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> I am the ghost of your
great-grandmother.</font>

01:14.351 --> 01:19.350

01:24.351 --> 01:26.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> What's going on?
All I can see is shoes.</font>

01:26.351 --> 01:27.751
<font color="#00FFFF"> You owe me ten.</font>
Oh, no, no.

01:27.752 --> 01:29.350
If you listened to what
I actually said...

01:29.351 --> 01:31.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, don't start.</font>

01:31.351 --> 01:32.351
<font color="#11FF11"> Guys, if you please!</font>

01:32.352 --> 01:35.350
<font color="#11FF11"> Perhaps one of us
should say a few words.</font>

01:35.351 --> 01:37.152
Yes, I'll do it.

01:37.153 --> 01:38.351
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

01:39.351 --> 01:41.885
Bagsie her room.

01:41.886 --> 01:44.285
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, she's only just died.</font>
<font color="#11FF11"> Honestly.</font>

01:44.286 --> 01:47.350
Well, I'll wait until they've taken
her away, of course.

01:47.351 --> 01:50.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> She was the last Button
of Button House.</font>

01:50.351 --> 01:52.352
<font color="#11FF11"> The final Button died today.</font>

01:53.619 --> 01:56.350
<font color="#11FF11"> Though, where she goes,
we cannot say.</font>

01:56.351 --> 01:58.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, he's off again.</font>

01:58.351 --> 02:00.350

02:00.351 --> 02:03.350

Oh, stupid body.</font>

02:08.351 --> 02:14.152

who then will come to call</font>

02:14.153 --> 02:15.351
<font color="#11FF11"> this home?</font>

02:18.351 --> 02:21.618
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, it's bigger than the place
we're renting. </font>And slightly over
budget...</font>

02:21.619 --> 02:23.350
Does it have a garden?

02:23.351 --> 02:25.485
<font color="#00FFFF"> No, but the downstairs flat's got
one you can look at.</font>

02:26.619 --> 02:28.350

02:43.153 --> 02:44.286
<font color="#FFFF00"> Hmm.</font>

02:46.351 --> 02:48.885
It's rubbish, isn't it? <font color="#FFFF00"> Yep. It's
awful. </font>It's so bad.

02:48.886 --> 02:50.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> And I hate it.</font>

02:50.351 --> 02:52.618
<font color="#00FFFF"> Sorry. </font>Nah, fair enough.</font>

03:02.752 --> 03:05.350
We're only looking at flats.
We can't afford to buy a house.

<font color="#11FF11"> This one's not for sale.</font>

03:06.752 --> 03:08.350
Then why are you calling?

03:08.351 --> 03:10.885
God, I hate estate agents.

03:10.886 --> 03:13.285

So, she was like my
step-great auntie?

03:58.351 --> 04:01.350
<font color="#11FF11"> There's no real term
for what you are, but she sadly</font>

04:01.351 --> 04:05.350
<font color="#11FF11"> had no direct relatives
and so you're the only one.</font>

04:05.351 --> 04:08.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> I feel like I'm in the head
master's office.</font>

04:08.351 --> 04:10.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> I put a pussy willow
in Daniel Bellingham's ear,</font>

He's a pastry chef.</font>

Oh, so close.

04:36.752 --> 04:37.886
Lady?

04:39.286 --> 04:40.350
Does that mean I'm a lady?

04:40.351 --> 04:44.350
OK, I know I'm a lady, but,
like, a lady lady?

04:44.351 --> 04:46.350
Like, Lady Gaga.
No, no...

04:46.351 --> 04:48.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's not this house, is it?</font>

04:48.351 --> 04:50.350
<font color="#11FF11"> As a matter of fact, it is.</font>

04:50.351 --> 04:51.885
<font color="#11FF11"> Button House.</font>

04:51.886 --> 04:53.350
No.

04:53.351 --> 04:57.152
<font color="#11FF11"> Now, obviously, it can take several
years to find a buyer</font>

04:57.153 --> 04:58.351

that sort of thing.</font>

<font color="#11FF11"> I mean, she lived on her own...</font>

05:09.351 --> 05:12.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> What if we keep it?</font>
Yes. That is a great idea.</font>

05:12.351 --> 05:15.018
<font color="#11FF11"> The house is in a state
of some disrepair.</font>

05:15.019 --> 05:17.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> We were looking for a bit
of a project anyway</font>

05:17.351 --> 05:19.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> and I retiled the bit
behind the sink in our</font>

05:19.351 --> 05:20.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> last flat, so...</font>

05:20.352 --> 05:22.350
<font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#FFFF00"> The splashback? </font>Is it?</font>

05:22.351 --> 05:26.350
<font color="#11FF11"> I'm not sure this falls
into the category of DIY.</font>

05:26.351 --> 05:28.350
<font color="#11FF11"> You should at least
have a survey done before...</font>

05:28.351 --> 05:31.350
I just feel like it would be better
to keep it in the family.

05:31.351 --> 05:34.350
I think, actually, that's what she
would have wanted.

05:34.351 --> 05:36.018
Aunt Helen. <font color="#11FF11"> Heather. </font>Heather.

05:36.019 --> 05:39.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> And if it can make money
for some hotel chain, then why not
make it work for us?</font>

05:39.351 --> 05:41.351
We could give up our jobs. <font color="#FFFF00"> Yes. </font>We
could do this full time.

05:41.352 --> 05:42.484
<font color="#FFFF00"> OK, yes.</font>

05:42.485 --> 05:45.350
Can we keep it? If we want to?

05:45.351 --> 05:47.351
<font color="#11FF11"> Well, it is your house.</font>

05:48.485 --> 05:50.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> Sorry.</font>

05:57.619 --> 05:59.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Look what the cat's dragged in.</font>

05:59.351 --> 06:01.285
<font color="#FFFF00"> Down here.</font>

06:01.286 --> 06:02.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> You're warm.</font>

06:02.351 --> 06:03.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> Getting warmer.</font>

06:03.352 --> 06:04.751
<font color="#FFFF00"> You're boiling.</font>

06:04.752 --> 06:07.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> No. Cold... Getting cold.</font>

06:07.351 --> 06:09.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Down here! You deaf...</font>

06:09.351 --> 06:12.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, I've got
the ears, haven't I?</font>

06:12.351 --> 06:14.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> Er...</font>

06:14.351 --> 06:16.152
<font color="#00FFFF"> Little guy...</font>

06:20.351 --> 06:22.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> But that's... </font>Checkmate.</font>

06:22.351 --> 06:23.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> HE SIGHS</font>
Fine.</font>

06:23.352 --> 06:24.751
<font color="#FFFF00"> Best of 20.</font>

06:24.752 --> 06:26.351
<font color="#00FFFF"> Come on.</font>

06:26.352 --> 06:32.350
Ideally, you want it
about five potatoes high.

06:32.351 --> 06:36.350
This one's going to have mud
on it, but you don't have mud on it.

06:36.351 --> 06:38.152
This is the tip.

06:38.153 --> 06:41.484
We insert the tip into the split.

06:41.485 --> 06:45.350
THEY TALK OVER EACH OTHER

06:45.351 --> 06:48.351
Then repeat the process
until you be done.

06:51.351 --> 06:55.018
<font color="#00FFFF"> Right, lovely talk of the day
from Mary today.</font>

06:55.019 --> 06:57.484
<font color="#00FFFF"> I think I can safely say
if we had any wicker, or indeed</font>

06:57.485 --> 06:59.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> we could touch anything,
we could all make a pretty</font>

06:59.351 --> 07:01.018
<font color="#00FFFF"> rad-looking basket.</font>

07:01.019 --> 07:04.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> Maybe next week, please, we'd all be
very interested to hear
about the trial.</font>

07:04.351 --> 07:05.752
<font color="#00FFFF"> The witch trial...</font>

07:08.351 --> 07:09.351
<font color="#00FFFF"> Too soon?</font>

07:09.351 --> 07:10.351
<font color="#00FFFF"> When you're ready.</font>

07:10.352 --> 07:13.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> So, tomorrow is food club!</font>

07:13.351 --> 07:16.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> When Kitty will be telling us
all about the first time</font>

07:16.351 --> 07:18.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> she ate an egg. </font>I actually didn't
like it.

07:18.351 --> 07:20.484
<font color="#00FFFF"> All right, Kitty. Well, save it for
tomorrow, please.</font>

07:20.485 --> 07:22.618
<font color="#00FFFF"> Give us something look forward to.</font>

07:22.619 --> 07:27.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> And then on Wednesday, Julian
has volunteered to make a speech.</font>

07:27.351 --> 07:30.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Yes, my by-election victory speech.
'91.</font>

07:30.351 --> 07:33.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Very inspiring, very long
and a few smutty jokes</font>

07:33.351 --> 07:34.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> to keep it light.</font>

07:34.352 --> 07:36.350
Oh, God. Spare me.

07:36.351 --> 07:37.484
<font color="#11FF11"> Right, that's it.</font>

07:37.485 --> 07:39.350
<font color="#11FF11"> Pat, sit down.</font>

07:39.351 --> 07:41.751
<font color="#11FF11"> Right, AOB?
Any other business?</font>

07:41.752 --> 07:43.484
<font color="#11FF11"> Well, I have got
something, actually.</font>

07:43.485 --> 07:48.350
<font color="#11FF11"> Now, ever since I moved rooms,
I've been woken every night by you,</font>

07:48.351 --> 07:50.350

07:50.351 --> 07:52.152
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, I don't think I do!</font>

07:52.153 --> 07:54.351
FANNY SCREAMS

07:57.351 --> 07:59.152
I always thought that was an owl.

07:59.153 --> 08:00.285
<font color="#00FFFF"> An owl?</font>

08:00.286 --> 08:01.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> Do you know what
an owl sounds like?</font>

08:01.351 --> 08:03.350
Well, now, I don't think so.

08:03.351 --> 08:04.351
<font color="#11FF11"> It has got to stop!</font>

08:04.352 --> 08:08.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Look, this is my house
and I shall do what I like.</font>

08:08.351 --> 08:09.351
<font color="#00FFFF"> It was mine first.</font>

08:09.352 --> 08:11.152
<font color="#FFFF00"> No, that's the land, not the house.</font>

08:11.153 --> 08:12.350
HE MIMICS HER

08:12.351 --> 08:14.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, I wish you would all hush.</font>

08:14.351 --> 08:17.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> I cannot do my work
with all this agitation.</font>

08:17.351 --> 08:20.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Work? You haven't done a day's work
in your life, or death.</font>

08:20.351 --> 08:23.350
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh! </font>He's an artist. <font color="#FFFF00"> Pfft! </font>He's ahead
of his time.

08:23.351 --> 08:26.350
<font color="#11FF11"> Oh, he can't still be ahead of his
time, Kitty.</font>

08:26.351 --> 08:28.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Guys, please!</font>

08:28.351 --> 08:30.618
<font color="#FFFF00"> Why don't you just go back
to your old room in the east wing?</font>

08:30.619 --> 08:32.350
<font color="#11FF11"> I don't see why I should.</font>

08:32.351 --> 08:34.350
<font color="#11FF11"> I wanted the garden view.
Now, as ranking officer...</font>

08:34.351 --> 08:37.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> The garden view comes
with the screaming woman.</font>

08:37.351 --> 08:39.350
You get used to it after 100 years.

08:39.351 --> 08:42.284
THEY TALK OVER EACH OTHER

08:42.285 --> 08:43.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Let's be serious here.</font>

08:43.351 --> 08:45.350
<font color="#11FF11"> Don't you get involved.</font>

08:45.351 --> 08:47.351
<font color="#00FFFF"> Argh!</font>

08:48.351 --> 08:49.351
<font color="#00FFFF"> It's simple.</font>

08:49.352 --> 08:51.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> You swap rooms.</font>

08:51.351 --> 08:56.286
<font color="#00FFFF"> You go up top, you come
ground floor and no jumpy.</font>

08:57.351 --> 09:00.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Right. Well, that would suit me, I
think.</font>

09:00.351 --> 09:01.351
<font color="#11FF11"> Yeah, that could work.</font>

09:01.352 --> 09:03.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> Not just a pretty face.</font>

09:03.351 --> 09:04.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, quite.</font>

09:10.485 --> 09:11.619
<font color="#11FF11"> Hmm.</font>

09:15.351 --> 09:16.351
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

09:18.351 --> 09:19.351
<font color="#11FF11"> Ah.</font>

09:20.351 --> 09:21.351
<font color="#11FF11"> Splendid.</font>

09:28.351 --> 09:30.351
CLOCK CHIMES

09:39.351 --> 09:40.752
<font color="#11FF11"> Fanny?</font>

09:47.019 --> 09:48.286
<font color="#11FF11"> What is it, Fanny?</font>

09:51.351 --> 09:52.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> George?</font>

09:52.352 --> 09:54.350
SHE SCREAMS

09:54.351 --> 09:56.351
<font color="#11FF11"> Oh, for heaven's sake.</font>

09:57.752 --> 10:01.485
<font color="#11FF11"> Throw yourself out of
your own damned window.</font>

10:05.351 --> 10:07.351
# I'm bringing sexy back... #

10:12.485 --> 10:14.350
# O-o-o-h

10:14.351 --> 10:15.352
# O-o-o-h. #

10:19.351 --> 10:23.350
# My life has been so overprotected.
#

10:23.351 --> 10:25.350
I always get the timing
wrong on that.

10:25.351 --> 10:26.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> Hang on, hang on.</font>

10:28.351 --> 10:30.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> I think this is it.</font>

10:32.619 --> 10:33.752
Oh, my God.

10:35.351 --> 10:37.751
My heart.

10:37.752 --> 10:39.152
It's so strange.

10:39.153 --> 10:41.351
I feel like I know
the place already.

10:43.351 --> 10:47.350
This track, every tree.

10:47.351 --> 10:50.885
It's like I've been
here my whole life.

10:50.886 --> 10:52.350
Like it's...

10:52.351 --> 10:54.351
..home.

10:54.352 --> 10:56.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> This is the wrong one.</font>
Yeah.

11:00.351 --> 11:01.351
<font color="#11FF11"> This really is beyond the pale.</font>

11:01.352 --> 11:03.152
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, has it happened again?</font>

11:03.153 --> 11:06.350
<font color="#11FF11"> You went in my room, you said,
"George", and then threw yourself</font>

11:06.351 --> 11:09.350
<font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#FFFF00"> out of the window. </font>Well, look, I
don't even realise I'm doing it.</font>

11:09.351 --> 11:12.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> Perhaps there's something deeply
buried reason why you feel</font>

11:12.351 --> 11:14.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> like you have to re-enact...</font>

11:14.351 --> 11:16.350
Maybe try jumping out of
the window before bed,

11:16.351 --> 11:17.351
get it out of the way.

11:17.352 --> 11:21.350
<font color="#11FF11"> No, it's not so much the jumping,
it's the screaming that's annoying.</font>

11:21.351 --> 11:22.351
<font color="#00FFFF"> Yes, that's a compromise.</font>

11:22.352 --> 11:25.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> Keep the jumping, but do it
silently.</font>

11:25.351 --> 11:27.350
Staying hush whilst
falling from a height?

11:27.351 --> 11:28.351
Tush and flops.

11:28.352 --> 11:32.285
<font color="#FFFF00"> Look, perhaps I scream because...</font>

11:32.286 --> 11:34.285
<font color="#FFFF00"> ..and I've never told
anyone this, but...</font>

11:34.286 --> 11:35.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> It's quite all right.
We shan't pry.</font>

11:35.351 --> 11:37.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's just that the night
that I actually...</font>

11:37.351 --> 11:39.350
<font color="#11FF11"> No, look, no screaming.</font>

11:39.351 --> 11:41.484
<font color="#11FF11"> That's all I ask.
Is that reasonable? Good.</font>

11:41.485 --> 11:44.618
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh! Argh! Eeh!</font>

11:44.619 --> 11:46.351
<font color="#00FFFF"> Box. Move.</font>

11:46.352 --> 11:47.485
<font color="#00FFFF"> Wheel.</font>

11:48.485 --> 11:51.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Motor car. </font>Car!</font>

11:51.351 --> 11:54.350
<font color="#11FF11"> Wow. It's like a blooming spaceship.</font>

11:54.351 --> 11:56.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> Poor creatures must be lost.</font>

11:56.351 --> 12:00.350
MUSIC: Kids In America
by Kim Wilde

12:00.351 --> 12:01.351
<font color="#11FF11"> It's Kim Wilde.</font>

12:03.286 --> 12:06.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> Let me pluck out my eyes
for never will I see</font>

12:06.351 --> 12:08.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> such beauty again.</font>

12:08.351 --> 12:10.351
<font color="#11FF11"> Yes, he'd make a very fine soldier.</font>

12:12.752 --> 12:14.019
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

12:21.351 --> 12:22.351
Wow.

12:22.352 --> 12:24.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> Shall we, Lady Alison?</font>

12:33.886 --> 12:35.153
ALISON GASPS

12:36.351 --> 12:37.619
Oh, my...

12:39.351 --> 12:43.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> This is 100% the most
incredible moment of my life,</font>

12:43.351 --> 12:46.285
<font color="#FFFF00"> apart from my wedding.</font>

12:46.286 --> 12:48.018
And it's all ours.

12:48.019 --> 12:49.618
<font color="#00FFFF"> What did that girl just say?</font>

12:49.619 --> 12:51.751
<font color="#11FF11"> She must be related to you.</font>

12:51.752 --> 12:56.350
<font color="#11FF11"> Like a niece, a great,
great, great...</font>

12:56.351 --> 12:58.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> No, no, no, no.
She's no niece of mine.</font>

12:58.351 --> 13:02.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> Look at her. She's exposing her
knees and she's got a tattoo.</font>

13:02.351 --> 13:03.618
So, this is the library.

13:03.619 --> 13:05.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Does that mean we have
to start reading books?</font>

13:05.351 --> 13:06.351
<font color="#00FFFF"> Philistine.</font>

13:06.352 --> 13:08.484
<font color="#11FF11"> It'll be nice to have
some new faces around.</font>

13:08.485 --> 13:10.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> There's enough faces already.</font>

13:10.351 --> 13:12.350
We have to fix up all the
plasterwork.

13:12.351 --> 13:15.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> But need fix architrave.</font>

13:15.351 --> 13:16.351
<font color="#11FF11"> Oh, yeah.</font>

13:16.352 --> 13:18.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> We could do every room in a
different style. </font>Great idea.</font>

13:18.352 --> 13:19.751
<font color="#00FFFF"> Over my dead body!</font>

13:19.752 --> 13:21.351
<font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Wait... </font>I know.</font>

13:22.351 --> 13:25.152
<font color="#FFFF00"> Ye olde worlde.</font>

13:25.153 --> 13:26.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> 1950s.</font>

13:26.351 --> 13:27.351
THEY GROAN

13:28.351 --> 13:30.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Club Tropicana.</font>

13:30.351 --> 13:31.351
<font color="#00FFFF"> That's fun.</font>

13:31.352 --> 13:33.484
<font color="#FFFF00"> Wow. </font>Unbelievable.</font>

13:33.485 --> 13:36.350
<font color="#11FF11"> Well, they seem really nice.
Let's give them a chance.</font>

13:36.351 --> 13:38.350
Look at that.

13:38.351 --> 13:39.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> What is that? </font>Is that a lake?

13:39.352 --> 13:42.350
<font color="#11FF11"> I hate it when that happens.</font>

13:42.351 --> 13:43.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's a lake.</font>

13:43.352 --> 13:46.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, there's only two of them.
Still plenty of room for us.</font>

13:46.351 --> 13:48.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> This is going to make one
incredible hotel.</font>

13:48.351 --> 13:49.352
THEY GASP

13:52.019 --> 13:53.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> What is hotel?</font>

13:53.351 --> 13:56.152
<font color="#11FF11"> Well, a hotel is...</font>

13:56.153 --> 13:57.285
<font color="#00FFFF"> Kill them.</font>

13:57.286 --> 13:58.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> I quite agree.</font>

13:58.351 --> 14:01.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> If we all approve the use of force
to enable them to,</font>

14:01.351 --> 14:03.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> you know, not live any more.</font>

14:03.351 --> 14:06.152
<font color="#11FF11"> Out of the question. That's
completely immoral. </font>And it's wrong.</font>

14:06.153 --> 14:08.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> And if we do kill them, we could be
stuck with them forever.</font>

14:08.351 --> 14:09.885
<font color="#FFFF00"> Would that so bad?</font>

14:09.886 --> 14:11.885
<font color="#11FF11"> She's married, Thomas.
Look at them.</font>

14:11.886 --> 14:14.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Why must I always be spurned?</font>

14:14.351 --> 14:16.350
<font color="#11FF11"> Couldn't we all just
live in the gatehouse?</font>

14:16.351 --> 14:17.484
I'd rather kill them.

14:17.485 --> 14:19.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#FFFF00"> Kill them. </font>Here, here.</font>

14:19.351 --> 14:21.018
<font color="#11FF11"> But that's a crime.</font>

14:21.019 --> 14:22.350
<font color="#11FF11"> CLOCK CHIMES</font>
We'll hang.</font>

FANNY SCREAMS

14:24.351 --> 14:26.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> Dammit, Fanny!</font>

14:26.351 --> 14:28.019
<font color="#11FF11"> We could always try...</font>

14:29.351 --> 14:30.351
<font color="#11FF11"> ..haunting?</font>

14:31.485 --> 14:33.350
<font color="#11FF11"> We're ghosts.</font>

14:33.351 --> 14:34.351
THEY MURMUR

14:39.351 --> 14:41.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Your tea, m'lady.</font>

14:41.351 --> 14:42.351
Thank you, Jeeves.

14:44.886 --> 14:46.618
<font color="#FFFF00"> Taste all right? </font>Why?

14:46.619 --> 14:49.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> I couldn't get any water
in the kitchen and I couldn't find</font>

14:49.351 --> 14:51.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> the other kitchen,
so I ended up using the garden tap,</font>

14:51.351 --> 14:53.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> and then there's no electric
in the kitchen, so I found a plug</font>

14:53.351 --> 14:54.885
<font color="#FFFF00"> that works in the library.</font>

14:54.886 --> 14:58.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> I don't know if the water's
drinkable, but I boiled it twice.</font>

14:58.351 --> 15:01.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> PIGEONS COO</font>
I love the sound of the country.</font>

15:01.351 --> 15:02.351
It's in the room.

15:02.352 --> 15:04.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, yeah.</font>

15:04.351 --> 15:06.285
<font color="#FFFF00"> It must be nesting somewhere.</font>

15:06.286 --> 15:07.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Right, what's first?</font>

15:07.351 --> 15:09.618
<font color="#FFFF00"> The pipes? Electrics?</font>

15:09.619 --> 15:11.350
Probably get the bird out the room.

15:11.351 --> 15:13.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah.</font>

15:13.351 --> 15:14.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> Come on, then, pigeon.</font>

15:14.352 --> 15:16.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Gah!</font>

15:16.351 --> 15:17.351
<font color="#11FF11"> Now, then.</font>

15:17.352 --> 15:20.350
<font color="#11FF11"> Let's have a look at some
of the skills at our
disposal, shall we?</font>

15:20.351 --> 15:22.350
<font color="#11FF11"> Now, we all know that Robin can do
that thing with the lights.</font>

15:22.351 --> 15:23.351
<font color="#11FF11"> Will you please, Robin?</font>

15:23.352 --> 15:25.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, yeah.</font>

15:25.351 --> 15:26.752
<font color="#00FFFF"> Heugh!</font>

15:30.351 --> 15:32.350
<font color="#11FF11"> THEY CHUCKLE</font>
Very good.</font>

15:32.351 --> 15:33.351
<font color="#11FF11"> Yes, Mary.</font>

15:33.352 --> 15:36.350
When I pass through the livings,
they smells burnings.

15:36.351 --> 15:38.350
<font color="#11FF11"> Excellent. None of those are plural,
but...</font>

15:38.351 --> 15:40.618
Tis a most noxious stink.

15:40.619 --> 15:43.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> When I was alive...</font>

15:43.351 --> 15:44.351

15:44.352 --> 15:49.350

cups, but, you know.</font>

16:51.153 --> 16:54.350
<font color="#11FF11"> Excellent. Well, with my leadership
and your skills...</font>

17:11.351 --> 17:13.018
<font color="#FFFF00"> All right, mate.</font>

17:13.019 --> 17:14.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> Is she coming out?</font>

17:15.351 --> 17:16.351
<font color="#00FFFF"> Yes, I think she is.</font>

17:16.352 --> 17:17.352
<font color="#FFFF00"> She's coming out!</font>

17:18.752 --> 17:20.349
<font color="#11FF11"> Stand to, everybody.</font>

17:20.351 --> 17:21.351
<font color="#11FF11"> Prepare for action.</font>

17:21.351 --> 17:22.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> Good luck, everyone.</font>

17:22.352 --> 17:25.352
<font color="#FFFF00"> And remember, as long
as you do your best...</font>

17:29.351 --> 17:31.350
<font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#FFFF00"> Finished? </font>Yes.</font>

17:31.351 --> 17:32.485
Hot water's stopped.

17:34.019 --> 17:35.153
<font color="#11FF11"> Go for Robin.</font>

17:41.619 --> 17:43.618
ROBIN CRIES OUT

17:43.619 --> 17:45.351
<font color="#11FF11"> Man down. Right, cue Jemima.</font>

17:46.886 --> 17:48.350
# Ring a ring o' roses... #

17:48.351 --> 17:49.618
LOUD MUSIC BLASTS

17:49.619 --> 17:52.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Yes! Got the speakers hooked up.</font>

17:52.351 --> 17:54.350
Well, that's the main thing.

17:54.351 --> 17:56.350
<font color="#11FF11"> Yes, please, Mary.</font>

17:56.351 --> 17:57.751
I think your toast is burning.

17:57.752 --> 17:59.350
<font color="#11FF11"> Dammit!</font>

17:59.351 --> 18:01.350
<font color="#11FF11">All on you now, Julian. </font>Come on,
Julian! <font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#FFFF00"> Go for it!</font>

18:01.351 --> 18:04.351
<font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#FFFF00"> Push it! </font>Come on!</font>

18:06.352 --> 18:08.352
<font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#11FF11"> Come on, Julian! </font>Push it!</font>

18:10.019 --> 18:12.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#11FF11"> Come on, Julian! </font>Come on, push it!</font>

18:13.351 --> 18:15.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#11FF11"> Come on! </font>Push it!</font>

18:15.351 --> 18:17.285
VASE SCRAPES AGAINST TABLE

18:17.286 --> 18:19.350
<font color="#11FF11"> Dammit!</font>

18:19.351 --> 18:21.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's much bigger than a cup, so...</font>

18:21.351 --> 18:22.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> Ah!</font>

18:22.352 --> 18:24.350
<font color="#11FF11"> Haunting's hard, isn't it?</font>

18:24.351 --> 18:25.352
So, how did it go?

18:27.351 --> 18:28.351
Guys?

18:30.351 --> 18:33.286
<font color="#FFFF00"> Right, well, I think
the boiler is in...</font>

18:36.351 --> 18:37.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> ..there?</font>

18:41.351 --> 18:43.351
LIGHT SWITCH CLICKS

18:45.351 --> 18:46.352
<font color="#FFFF00"> After you.</font>

18:51.619 --> 18:52.752
Oh.

19:12.351 --> 19:15.350
Sing something,
make this less scary.

19:15.351 --> 19:18.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> # Don't be scared</font>

19:18.351 --> 19:20.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> # Don't be scared</font>

19:20.351 --> 19:22.285
<font color="#FFFF00"> # I'm not scared... #</font>

19:22.286 --> 19:24.350
OK, you're making it worse.

19:24.351 --> 19:26.286
<font color="#FFFF00"> There's another switch here.</font>

19:31.351 --> 19:33.018
<font color="#FFFF00"> I can fix this.</font>

19:33.019 --> 19:34.285
What?

19:34.286 --> 19:35.350
Are you joking?

19:35.351 --> 19:37.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#11FF11"> Who are they? </font>I don't know.</font>

19:37.351 --> 19:38.885
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'll look it up on YouTube.</font>

19:38.886 --> 19:41.350
Mike, not everything can be learned
from a YouTube tutorial.

19:41.351 --> 19:43.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> You'd be surprised. I found a guide
on how to tame an eagle.</font>

19:43.351 --> 19:46.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah, but that's not... What, an
actual eagle? </font>Mm-hm.</font>

19:46.351 --> 19:48.885
<font color="#FFFF00"> Why would you need to know that?</font>
I don't know.</font>

19:48.886 --> 19:51.018
<font color="#FFFF00"> Cool, though.</font>
So cool.

19:51.019 --> 19:52.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Um...</font>

19:52.351 --> 19:54.351
Oi, don't fiddle with that.
Do you even know what that does?

19:54.352 --> 19:56.751
<font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah, it's a thing
for the thingy bob.</font>

19:56.752 --> 19:58.351
<font color="#00FFFF"> It's the valve for the filling loop.</font>

20:00.619 --> 20:02.484
GHOSTS: Hey! Woo!

20:02.485 --> 20:04.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Fixed it. </font>No, you haven't.</font>

20:04.351 --> 20:05.351
<font color="#00FFFF"> It's just the pilot light.</font>

20:05.351 --> 20:06.351
Do you think we need a new one?

20:06.351 --> 20:07.351
<font color="#11FF11"> What? Get rid of old Betsy?</font>

20:07.352 --> 20:08.618
<font color="#11FF11"> No, no.</font>

20:08.619 --> 20:11.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Let's see what the surveyor
says next week.</font>

20:11.351 --> 20:12.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> OK.</font>

20:14.752 --> 20:16.751
<font color="#FFFF00">Ready?</font> <font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#11FF11"> What for? </font>I'm ready.</font>

20:16.752 --> 20:18.350
Ready.

20:18.351 --> 20:20.350
GHOSTS: Aw.

20:20.351 --> 20:23.350
<font color="#00FFFF">I wasn't ready.</font>
<font color="#11FF11"> Well, that was nice, anyway.</font>

20:23.351 --> 20:25.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> Yeah, come back soo...</font>

20:25.351 --> 20:27.351
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, they can't hear me, can they?</font>

20:33.351 --> 20:34.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> They're not warming up down here.</font>

20:34.352 --> 20:35.751
<font color="#FFFF00"> How's yours?</font>

20:35.752 --> 20:37.351
Give me a sec.

20:41.351 --> 20:43.351
PIGEON COOS

20:50.351 --> 20:51.351
There you are.

20:54.351 --> 20:55.886
<font color="#00FFFF"> Hello.</font>

20:57.351 --> 21:02.286
<font color="#11FF11"> We'll be overrun with people
taunting us with their life.</font>

21:04.351 --> 21:06.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> No, we'll just try again.</font>

21:06.351 --> 21:08.885
<font color="#FFFF00"> If at first you don't succeed...</font>

21:08.886 --> 21:10.018
Precisely.

21:10.019 --> 21:11.285
That's right.

21:11.286 --> 21:13.350
We must prepare another charge.

21:13.351 --> 21:15.018
Hit them when they're vulnerable.

21:15.019 --> 21:17.352
We may have lost the battle,
but the war is far from over.

21:28.351 --> 21:30.350
SOMEONE SCREAMS

21:30.351 --> 21:32.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Fanny's early.</font>
I'm right here.</font>

21:32.351 --> 21:34.350
What?

21:34.351 --> 21:36.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> It's Kim Wilde!</font>

21:36.351 --> 21:38.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Alison!</font>

21:38.351 --> 21:39.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> Alison!</font>

21:39.352 --> 21:41.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Alison.</font>

21:41.351 --> 21:43.152
<font color="#FFFF00"> Alison.</font>

21:43.153 --> 21:44.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Look at me. Look at me.</font>

21:44.351 --> 21:46.484
<font color="#FFFF00"> Alison, can you hear me?</font>

21:46.485 --> 21:48.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Alison, I'm here.</font>

21:48.351 --> 21:50.285
<font color="#FFFF00"> Can you hear me? Yeah?</font>

21:50.286 --> 21:51.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Stay with me.</font>

21:51.351 --> 21:52.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> Keep your eyes open.</font>

21:52.351 --> 21:53.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> Alison, I'm here.</font>

22:04.351 --> 22:06.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> B-b-b-b... L-l-l-l...</font>

22:06.351 --> 22:09.152
<font color="#00FFFF"> Let me be absolutely clear.</font>

22:09.153 --> 22:11.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> Did you push her? </font>Well,
now, the thing you have to
understand is this...</font>

22:11.351 --> 22:13.751
<font color="#11FF11"> I'm sorry, but it's rather
a yes or no question.</font>

22:13.752 --> 22:15.350
THEY TALK OVER EACH OTHER

22:15.351 --> 22:16.618
<font color="#00FFFF"> I took a decision to...</font>

22:16.619 --> 22:19.350
Pushy or no pushy?

22:19.351 --> 22:21.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> Robin, let me ask you this.
You know, what was the context?</font>

22:21.351 --> 22:25.152
<font color="#FFFF00"> Answer the question, damn you!</font>

22:25.153 --> 22:26.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> Thomas, I'm trying
to answer the question,</font>

22:26.351 --> 22:27.351
<font color="#00FFFF"> if you'll let me finish.</font>

22:27.352 --> 22:30.350
<font color="#11FF11"> Now, look here. A sacrifice was made
for the greater good.</font>

22:30.351 --> 22:32.350
<font color="#11FF11"> We wanted her out of
the house, didn't we?</font>

22:32.351 --> 22:34.350
<font color="#11FF11"> This has either killed
her or scared her off.</font>

22:34.351 --> 22:36.351
You don't just do that to someone.

22:38.351 --> 22:42.152
What kind of coward would push
a lady out of the window?

22:42.153 --> 22:44.350
<font color="#11FF11"> Now, steady on, Fanny.</font>

22:44.351 --> 22:46.484
No, I won't, because I was pushed.

22:46.485 --> 22:49.350
You hear me? I was pushed.

22:49.351 --> 22:51.351
And I have never told a soul.

22:51.352 --> 22:54.350
It was my husband, George.

22:54.351 --> 22:58.885
<font color="#00FFFF"> I caught him upon the
groundskeeper... </font>Good lord.</font>

22:58.886 --> 23:01.350
..with the butler on him.

23:01.351 --> 23:03.350
<font color="#11FF11">Like a sandwich?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00"> A man-wich.</font>

23:03.351 --> 23:06.350
It's actually known as a Moroccan
tea party. <font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Guys!</font>

23:06.351 --> 23:09.885
Clearly, he didn't trust me
with his sordid little secret,

23:09.886 --> 23:12.350
so he just did away with me.

23:12.351 --> 23:14.350
But he was wrong, wasn't he?
He was very wrong.

23:14.351 --> 23:16.350
Because I have kept it, haven't I?

23:16.351 --> 23:17.618
THEY MURMUR

23:17.619 --> 23:19.350
Until now.

23:19.351 --> 23:21.350
Until now.

23:21.351 --> 23:22.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> I mean, I did know that.</font>

23:22.352 --> 23:25.018
<font color="#FFFF00">I watched all of that.</font> <font color="#11FF11"> So did I.</font>
Yeah, yeah.

23:25.019 --> 23:26.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> I wish I had watched it.</font>

23:26.351 --> 23:27.619
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, Fanny.</font>

23:29.352 --> 23:33.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> That must have been a terrible
burden to bear for all those years.</font>

23:33.351 --> 23:37.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Perhaps now that you've shared it,</font>

23:37.351 --> 23:39.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> you'll be free of your nightly
terrors.</font>

23:39.351 --> 23:42.350
Oh, do you suppose so?

23:42.351 --> 23:43.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'm sure of it.</font>

23:46.351 --> 23:49.350
FANNY SCREAMS

23:49.351 --> 23:51.351
<font color="#11FF11"> Fanny!</font>

23:52.351 --> 23:55.350
<font color="#11FF11"> You see, Pat, what did I tell you?
That's where talking gets you.</font>

23:55.351 --> 23:58.350
<font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#FFFF00"> Nowhere! </font>It was silly of me to
suggest it really.</font>

23:58.351 --> 24:01.018
<font color="#FFFF00"> Lesson learnt.
What shall we do?</font>

24:01.019 --> 24:05.886
<font color="#11FF11"> I don't know. I'm not going to spend
eternity listening to that racket at
the same time every night.</font>

24:11.351 --> 24:13.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#11FF11"> It's worth a try. </font>Ah.</font>

24:13.351 --> 24:14.351
<font color="#00FFFF"> Hah!</font>

24:19.351 --> 24:20.886
JULIAN GRUNTS

24:22.351 --> 24:24.618
CLOCK CHIMES

24:24.619 --> 24:26.886
FANNY SCREAMS

24:29.351 --> 24:30.351
<font color="#11FF11"> Much better.</font>

24:30.352 --> 24:32.350
<font color="#11FF11">Morning.</font> <font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Morning. </font>Good morning.</font>

24:32.351 --> 24:33.618
Good day.

24:33.619 --> 24:35.285
<font color="#11FF11"> Finally.</font>

24:35.286 --> 24:37.351
<font color="#11FF11"> Things can get back
to normal around here.</font>

24:49.153 --> 24:50.351
TOILET FLUSHES

24:52.351 --> 24:54.350
Shift over.

24:54.351 --> 24:55.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> Can't I lie down?</font>

24:55.352 --> 24:57.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'm so tired.</font>

24:57.351 --> 24:58.351
Poor you.

24:58.351 --> 24:59.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's all right for you.</font>

24:59.352 --> 25:01.484
<font color="#FFFF00"> You've been asleep for two weeks.</font>

25:01.485 --> 25:03.152
It's called a coma.

25:03.153 --> 25:04.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Induced coma.</font>

25:04.351 --> 25:05.351
Oh.

25:06.351 --> 25:07.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> You all right?</font>

25:07.352 --> 25:08.352
Yeah.

25:09.619 --> 25:11.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'm glad you didn't die.</font>

25:12.351 --> 25:14.886
Well, technically, I did for a bit.

25:17.752 --> 25:19.351
Did I dream that house?

25:20.485 --> 25:22.619
I feel like I dreamt it all.

25:24.351 --> 25:26.018
Oh.

25:26.019 --> 25:28.350
Have you had the survey back?

25:28.351 --> 25:29.352
<font color="#FFFF00"> No. No, not yet.</font>

25:30.351 --> 25:31.352
Hmm.

25:35.351 --> 25:39.484
<font color="#00FFFF"> Now, have her face the right way,
you want the end with the milk</font>

25:39.485 --> 25:43.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> there, not the end for looking
and chewing out of.</font>

25:43.351 --> 25:47.018
<font color="#00FFFF"> You want to take this
finger and this finger,</font>

25:47.019 --> 25:51.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> gently but quickly, and that
releases a big squirt of the stuff.</font>

25:51.351 --> 25:53.350
<font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Good Lord. </font>Chuck some of the muck
out.</font>

25:53.351 --> 25:55.484
<font color="#00FFFF"> So, you can check then if the milk
be smooth and white,</font>

25:55.485 --> 25:57.351
<font color="#00FFFF"> not beige and lumpy.</font>

25:59.019 --> 26:01.285
<font color="#11FF11"> Oh, my goodness.
They're coming back!</font>

26:01.286 --> 26:03.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> What?</font>

26:03.351 --> 26:07.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Right, so you know how I said
the survey hadn't come back?</font>

26:07.351 --> 26:08.751
Oh, God.

26:08.752 --> 26:10.350
What did it say?

26:10.351 --> 26:12.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> How does she seem?
Is it she OK?</font>

26:12.351 --> 26:15.350
<font color="#11FF11"> I don't know, they're not getting
out of the carriage.</font>

26:15.351 --> 26:17.285
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, there's good
news and bad news.</font>

26:17.286 --> 26:18.350
OK, OK, OK.

26:18.351 --> 26:19.351
Well...

26:19.351 --> 26:20.351
Give me the good news...

26:20.352 --> 26:22.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> The bad news is that the repairs
are extensive,</font>

26:22.351 --> 26:23.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> like, big structural stuff,</font>

can't even begin to renovate</font>

26:26.351 --> 26:31.152
<font color="#FFFF00"> this place without a huge amount
of cash to do those things.</font>

26:31.153 --> 26:33.751
<font color="#FFFF00"> OK. Yeah... </font>So, the good news is I
took out a loan!</font>

26:33.752 --> 26:35.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> What? </font>Yeah. I took out a loan.</font>

26:35.351 --> 26:37.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Some loans. Paid some deposits.</font>

26:37.351 --> 26:39.285
Why didn't you tell me?

26:39.286 --> 26:41.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Because I didn't want you to worry.</font>

26:41.351 --> 26:43.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> This is your dream, right?</font>

26:43.351 --> 26:45.484
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'm going to do everything
I can to make it come true.</font>

26:53.351 --> 26:55.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Hey. </font>All right, mate.</font>

26:55.351 --> 26:57.153
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> How you doing? </font>Terry.</font>

27:01.153 --> 27:03.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> So, we're going to inspect
the site, make it safe.</font>

27:03.351 --> 27:05.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> Everyone has to wear
one of these for now.</font>

27:05.351 --> 27:10.350
<font color="#00FFFF"> Insurance reasons mainly,
but, well, you just should.</font>

27:10.351 --> 27:12.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Cool. </font>Cracking on, then.</font>

27:13.619 --> 27:15.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Exciting, isn't it?</font>

27:15.351 --> 27:18.286
<font color="#FFFF00"> Why don't you go and have a lie
down and I'll grab your bags, yeah?</font>

27:24.351 --> 27:25.352
You should be wearing a hard hat.

27:36.351 --> 27:39.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, she spoke to me,
she spoke to me, she saw me,</font>

27:39.351 --> 27:42.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> she spoke to me. </font>What? What the
devil are you talking about?

27:46.153 --> 27:47.618
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, there you are.</font>

27:47.619 --> 27:50.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> I thought you were
getting some rest.</font>

27:50.351 --> 27:52.484
<font color="#FFFF00"> No turning back now.</font>

27:52.485 --> 27:54.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> What if we made a mistake?</font>
What?</font>

27:54.351 --> 27:57.285
What if this was a bad idea
and we should have just sold it?

27:57.286 --> 27:59.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> Don't say that.
This is a great idea.</font>

27:59.351 --> 28:01.351
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's going to take a lot of work,
but we can do it.</font>

28:03.351 --> 28:04.351
Mike.

28:04.352 --> 28:06.618
<font color="#FFFF00"> You're terrified, and I get it.</font>

28:06.619 --> 28:08.350
Mike.

28:08.351 --> 28:11.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> I get it. I'm scared too.</font>

28:11.351 --> 28:14.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> This house and what we're doing,
it's a huge challenge and who knows</font>

28:14.351 --> 28:16.350
<font color="#FFFF00"> what we're going to have
to deal with on the way?</font>

28:16.351 --> 28:19.285
<font color="#FFFF00"> But, in the end,
we've got each other.</font>

28:19.286 --> 28:20.751
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's just us in this big old house.</font>

28:20.752 --> 28:23.153
<font color="#FFFF00"> There's nothing to be scared of,
is there?</font>
