WEBVTT

00:02.627 --> 00:06.047
We'd like everyone to gather
for a huge announcement!

00:08.383 --> 00:11.219
Okay. We'd like you two
to stay where you are

00:11.302 --> 00:13.013
for a huge announcement.

00:14.889 --> 00:18.518
After watching a bunch
of online magic videos,

00:18.601 --> 00:21.271
we believe
we have a future as...

00:21.354 --> 00:22.397
[both dramatically]
Magicians!

00:24.190 --> 00:26.359
[enthusiastically]
Yay!

00:27.318 --> 00:28.653
Frankie, why aren't
you clapping?

00:28.737 --> 00:31.364
They threw tissue
in the air, Paige.

00:32.824 --> 00:35.160
Now, for my first trick,

00:35.243 --> 00:36.453
I'll need a volunteer.

00:36.536 --> 00:37.871
-Me! Me!
-Her! Her!

00:37.954 --> 00:39.205
-Frankie!
-[groans]

00:41.207 --> 00:43.043
Please, pick a card.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.669
Memorize it, and put it back.

00:46.338 --> 00:48.089
You picked...

00:48.173 --> 00:49.799
-the Queen of Hearts.
-Nope!

00:50.842 --> 00:52.260
-The five of Clubs.
-Nope.

00:52.344 --> 00:54.012
13 of Rocks?

00:54.095 --> 00:55.013
That's not a card.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.141
Speaking of cards,

00:58.224 --> 01:00.060
Paige, you like spoons, right?

01:00.143 --> 01:01.728
Uh, I mean, I haven't really--

01:01.811 --> 01:04.022
-Cool!
-Okay.

01:04.105 --> 01:06.274
Now watch as I
bend this spoon

01:06.358 --> 01:08.234
with my mind.

01:09.694 --> 01:12.322
Just gotta spin around real quick
for unrelated reasons.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.579
And that...

01:19.662 --> 01:21.164
is how you magic.

01:22.582 --> 01:25.001
Frankie, look, I got
a souvenir from the show.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.295
Paige, that's a fork.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.549

-No.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.816
Wait! Actually,
that is my card.

01:47.899 --> 01:50.318
And it only took 39 guesses!

01:50.402 --> 01:51.486
And what if I told you

01:51.569 --> 01:54.030
the number 39 was
written on my chest?

01:54.114 --> 01:55.657
-Is it?
-No.

01:55.740 --> 01:58.284
But that would've been
pretty cool, right?

01:59.577 --> 02:02.205
Guys, we definitely want
your feedback on our tricks,

02:02.288 --> 02:04.124
so we're gonna go grab a pad,
so we can take notes.

02:09.295 --> 02:10.672
What was that all about?

02:10.755 --> 02:13.967
Bernie and Zane wanna know
what we think about their magic.

02:14.050 --> 02:15.051
Spoiler alert.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.136
I'm gonna say things.

02:16.219 --> 02:17.637
They're gonna cry things.

02:19.347 --> 02:22.142
Frankie, Bernie and Zane
need our support.

02:22.225 --> 02:23.685
I mean, sure,
they're not great at magic,

02:23.768 --> 02:25.478
but with our encouragement,
they'll get better.

02:25.562 --> 02:27.439
They're not just
"not great at magic."

02:27.522 --> 02:29.232
They're horrible,
and if they keep at it,

02:29.315 --> 02:30.650
it'll stop them from
finding the thing

02:30.734 --> 02:32.027
they're meant to do in life.

02:32.110 --> 02:33.194
Brutal honesty
will make them

02:33.278 --> 02:34.863
more successful
in the long run.

02:34.946 --> 02:37.032
-Well, I think you're wrong.
-Well, I think you're wrong.

02:37.115 --> 02:39.868
-Well, I think--
-Sweet Tea on a Tuesday!

02:41.369 --> 02:43.580
Don't you guys see
what's going on here?

02:43.663 --> 02:45.874
It's a classic
Paige versus Frankie

02:45.957 --> 02:47.959
in a "I'm Right About Life"
argument.

02:48.043 --> 02:50.170
Come on! I don't think
we disagree enough

02:50.253 --> 02:52.589
to be throwing the word
"classic" around.

02:53.840 --> 02:54.966
Oh, really?

02:55.050 --> 02:56.760
"Saying no
versus saying yes."

02:56.843 --> 02:59.679
"Listening to yourselves
versus listening to your fans."

02:59.804 --> 03:03.099
"Judging a book by its cover
versus not judging a book by its cover."

03:03.183 --> 03:04.476
Those were classics.

03:04.559 --> 03:06.269
Wow. We disagree a lot.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.856
Wait! What Amelia's saying is

03:09.939 --> 03:12.275
this gives us the chance
to put our opposing views to the test.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.277
Uh, that's not
what I was saying!

03:14.361 --> 03:16.613
Yeah! We can see
once and for all

03:16.696 --> 03:18.114
about who is right
about life!

03:18.198 --> 03:20.408
I said none of those words!

03:20.492 --> 03:22.285
I'll work with Zane
and be honest with him

03:22.369 --> 03:23.703
about how he lacks
the talent for magic.

03:23.787 --> 03:25.163
You work with Bernie,

03:25.246 --> 03:26.873
and use that encouraging,
supportive nonsense you believe in.

03:26.956 --> 03:28.625
Great! And at the end of the week,

03:28.708 --> 03:30.543
we'll see which one of them
is more successful.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.754
And if I win,
you have to wear a shirt that says,

03:32.837 --> 03:33.838
"Frankie is always right."

03:33.922 --> 03:35.590
Oh, and when I win,

03:35.674 --> 03:36.966
you have to wear
a shirt that says,

03:37.050 --> 03:38.343
"Paige is always right."

03:38.426 --> 03:41.429
And so it is written,
and so it shall be remembered!

03:41.513 --> 03:42.764
When this is over,

03:42.847 --> 03:45.934
one of us will be right about life.

03:48.770 --> 03:51.356
Your friendship is weird.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.017

04:28.018 --> 04:29.686
I made you something!

04:29.769 --> 04:30.603
[excited]
A bag!

04:31.438 --> 04:32.939
And it's big enough to carry

04:33.023 --> 04:35.942
all my hopes and dreams!

04:36.026 --> 04:38.194
Look inside!

04:38.278 --> 04:40.655
There's an inside?!

04:41.865 --> 04:43.867
It's a dress!

04:45.160 --> 04:47.287
It's made with
hemp and burlap.

04:47.370 --> 04:51.332
All natural.
100% organic materials.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.460
All the things
I know you love.

04:54.377 --> 04:55.545
So, do you love it?

04:55.628 --> 04:56.421
[forced]
I love it so much.

04:58.548 --> 05:01.384
I hate it so much!

05:01.468 --> 05:04.846
Willow, you're so cute,
you can pull anything off.

05:04.929 --> 05:06.848
I recommend starting
with that dress.

05:06.931 --> 05:08.808
It's hideous.

05:08.892 --> 05:10.226
It's not just uggo.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.478
It's itchy!

05:11.561 --> 05:14.356
It feels like I'm taking
a bath in sandpaper.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.649
And you know
how much I hate baths.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.485
You and me both, sister.

05:18.568 --> 05:21.112
You're just sitting
in your own filth.

05:22.697 --> 05:24.741
I gotta tell Amelia the truth.

05:24.824 --> 05:26.659
The dress just isn't for me.

05:26.743 --> 05:29.120
-You'll do no such thing.
-Why not?

05:29.204 --> 05:32.457
Let's just say Amelia doesn't
appreciate negative feedback.

05:34.626 --> 05:35.585
Wow!

05:35.669 --> 05:38.421
Thanks for making me
breakfast, Amelia.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.465
Oh, can you get me some salt?

05:40.548 --> 05:41.549
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:41.633 --> 05:42.884
You don't like my eggs?

05:42.967 --> 05:44.386
[chuckles]

05:45.929 --> 05:47.597
Here's some salt for ya!

05:50.684 --> 05:51.685
Whoa.

05:51.768 --> 05:54.521
Yeah! And then
she made me eat 'em!

05:55.814 --> 05:58.358
My doctor says
it took a year off my life.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.443
My point is,

06:00.527 --> 06:02.445
the only way you're gonna
get out of wearing that dress

06:02.529 --> 06:03.571
is to destroy it.

06:03.655 --> 06:05.907
Great! So how do we do that?

06:05.990 --> 06:07.200
"We"?

06:07.283 --> 06:08.576
[chuckles]
You think I'm gonna help you?

06:09.661 --> 06:10.995
You owe me.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.539
Remember?

06:16.626 --> 06:18.294
This had to be done.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.089
It's time for Bernie
to make real friends.

06:23.425 --> 06:25.176
Sorry, Mr. Mannequin,

06:25.260 --> 06:26.636
but you know what you did.

06:28.763 --> 06:30.473
Fine! I'll help you!

06:30.557 --> 06:33.268
Even though you cried
the whole drive home from the woods.

06:33.351 --> 06:35.603
That's cause you
made me take the wheel!

06:35.687 --> 06:37.564
I was tired!

06:41.568 --> 06:42.944
I will make these balls...

06:43.028 --> 06:44.654
disappear!

06:45.864 --> 06:47.365
Disappear!

06:48.616 --> 06:50.869
Zane, can I, uh, talk to you
about this whole magic thing?

06:50.952 --> 06:53.496
Why talk about magic
when I can dazzle you--

06:53.580 --> 06:54.622
Let me stop you right there.

06:55.665 --> 06:57.542
Zane, have you
heard the story

06:57.625 --> 06:59.669
about the water buffalo
who could fly?

06:59.753 --> 07:01.212
Water buffaloes can't fly.

07:01.296 --> 07:02.422
Exactly!

07:02.505 --> 07:04.049
And you can't do magic!

07:05.258 --> 07:06.092
[disappointed]
Oh.

07:06.634 --> 07:07.886
I don't like this story.

07:09.012 --> 07:10.513
Well, it's not over,

07:10.597 --> 07:13.391
because while the water buffalo
wasn't wasting its time flying,

07:13.475 --> 07:14.851
it was able to
discover something

07:14.934 --> 07:16.144
it was really good at it.

07:16.227 --> 07:17.687
-Like magic?
-No!

07:17.771 --> 07:19.647
Definitely not magic.

07:19.731 --> 07:22.484
Something nobody expected
the water buffalo to do.

07:22.567 --> 07:23.777
Like flying?

07:23.860 --> 07:26.780
No! Flying is a metaphor
for magic.

07:26.863 --> 07:29.407
-I can do magic!
-No you can't!

07:30.450 --> 07:31.368
Look, I'm sorry.
[chuckles]

07:31.910 --> 07:33.953
It's just not what
you're meant to do.

07:34.037 --> 07:36.414
But you're a great kid,
and I'm sure if you keep looking,

07:36.498 --> 07:38.124
you'll find something else
you're amazing at.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.668
Wow, Frankie!

07:39.751 --> 07:41.753
No one's ever been
that honest with me.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.547
Maybe you're right.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.883
Maybe there is something else
I'm meant to do.

07:46.966 --> 07:47.967
Thanks, Frankie.

07:48.051 --> 07:49.344
You're welcome.

07:49.427 --> 07:52.639
And remember what
the Mama water buffalo said to its baby.

07:52.722 --> 07:55.100
"Stay away from magic!"

07:58.812 --> 08:00.855
Watch as I take this coin,

08:00.939 --> 08:02.649
and make it...

08:02.732 --> 08:03.983
-Vanish!
-[coin clinks]

08:06.111 --> 08:07.612
You made it fall!

08:07.696 --> 08:09.864
That's... something!

08:09.948 --> 08:11.491
Yay! Gravity!

08:14.160 --> 08:15.787
Vanish!

08:15.870 --> 08:17.288
Bernie, the coin didn't drop.

08:17.372 --> 08:18.415
You're getting better.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.500
Nah, I just did it
without the coin that time

08:20.583 --> 08:21.459
to see how it felt.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.086
It felt good!

08:26.840 --> 08:28.675
Vanish!

08:29.592 --> 08:31.678
Oh my gosh!
Bernie, you did it!

08:31.761 --> 08:34.472
I did?
I-- I mean, I did!

08:34.556 --> 08:35.974
[both screaming excitedly]

08:37.308 --> 08:38.393
-Yeah, I mean...
-[clears throat]

08:39.227 --> 08:41.104
Cool. Cool.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.522
Yeah.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.275
Thanks for
helping me out, Paige.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.735
I'm so much better at magic now.

08:46.818 --> 08:48.820
It feels so good
to be good at something.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.074
You hear that?

08:53.158 --> 08:54.117
He feels good.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.286
Sounds like
encouragement is working.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.497
Well, I had a little chat
with Zane earlier,

08:59.581 --> 09:00.582
and let's just say,

09:00.665 --> 09:02.709
he's feeling pretty good, too.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.502
[groans]

09:05.628 --> 09:06.755
[sighs heavily]

09:08.048 --> 09:11.551
Ah. The sigh of a happy boy.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.138
Hey, Zane, what's wrong?

09:15.221 --> 09:17.265
I thought we had a great talk.
Remember?

09:17.349 --> 09:19.934
The water buffalo
who made peace with its inadequacies?

09:20.018 --> 09:21.561
Yeah.

09:21.644 --> 09:24.397
And I tried to find
something I'm good at,

09:24.481 --> 09:26.274
but the thing is

09:26.358 --> 09:28.443
I don't think
I'm good at anything.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.571
[sighs heavily]

09:33.365 --> 09:35.784
Ah, the hopeless despair

09:35.867 --> 09:37.744
of a happy, happy boy.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.585
Hey, Willow,
have you seen Zane?

09:45.669 --> 09:46.795
I haven't seen him
since yesterday.

09:46.878 --> 09:48.588
Yeah! I saw him out back.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.590
He's giving away all his stuff.

09:50.674 --> 09:52.676
What? Why?

09:52.759 --> 09:53.885
Not sure.

09:53.968 --> 09:56.554
Something about
how his life's a mess,

09:56.638 --> 09:58.556
and he has no need
for anything anymore.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.643
Oh, no.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.269
That sounds bad.

10:03.353 --> 10:04.938
Maybe I was too honest with him.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.356
Hey, Frankie,

10:06.439 --> 10:09.192
I've been drawing
dolphins all morning.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.194
Should I be an artist?!

10:11.277 --> 10:13.738
Uh... you--

10:13.822 --> 10:15.365
We all-- we--

10:16.282 --> 10:18.076
Zane needs me.
Gotta go. Bye!

10:20.286 --> 10:21.579
Zane, I'm so sorry.

10:21.663 --> 10:23.456
I went too far.

10:23.540 --> 10:24.749
What's going on?

10:24.833 --> 10:26.793
I'm giving away all my stuff.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.003
Thanks to you,

10:28.086 --> 10:29.629
I hit rock bottom!

10:30.880 --> 10:33.008
And yet, you're smiling!

10:33.091 --> 10:35.885
Yeah, because
something amazing happened.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.429
At first, I was sad,

10:37.512 --> 10:39.723
and started giving away
all my stuff.

10:39.806 --> 10:42.809
But then I realized
how good it feels to give.

10:42.892 --> 10:44.394
Oh. Totally agree.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.354
By the way,
my birthday is June 2nd,

10:46.438 --> 10:48.398
and I need a new
panini maker.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.859
Now I'm collecting donations

10:50.942 --> 10:53.361
to give to people
who really need it.

10:53.445 --> 10:55.363
I've never felt so good.

10:55.447 --> 10:56.573
Wait a minute.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.908
Zane, you basically
started your own charity.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.661
I think helping people
might be your true calling.

11:01.745 --> 11:03.329
Take that, Paige!
I'm winning!

11:03.413 --> 11:04.873
-What?
-You're winning!

11:04.956 --> 11:06.791
At life!
Ha, ha!

11:06.875 --> 11:09.294
<i>Mazel tov! </i>Woo!

11:09.377 --> 11:11.046
I guess you're right.

11:11.129 --> 11:14.299
None of this would've happened
if you weren't honest with me.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.967
How can I ever thank you?

11:16.051 --> 11:17.844
Oh, I-- I thought
I was clear before.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.764
June 2nd. Panini maker.
The big one.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.391
I like my bread hot and flat!

11:26.936 --> 11:30.815
All right, how are we gonna
destroy this thing

11:30.899 --> 11:32.776
so I never have to wear it.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.861
Why don't we just
cut it up, throw it away,

11:34.944 --> 11:36.237
and hope the cops
don't find it?

11:36.321 --> 11:37.822
Bing! Bang! Boom!
Done!

11:38.907 --> 11:40.200
You're fun!

11:42.118 --> 11:44.329
But I can't just
destroy the dress.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.456
Amelia will know
I don't like it.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.417
Ah, I see what you're saying.

11:49.501 --> 11:51.628
We gotta make it look like an accident.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.756
You frighten me
just the right amount.

11:56.883 --> 11:59.427
Has anybody seen
my new dress?!

11:59.511 --> 12:02.138
I put it on top of a tray
of cookie dough

12:02.222 --> 12:03.765
for some reason.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.016
Oh, no!

12:05.100 --> 12:08.687
I put that tray in the oven
16 to 18 minutes ago!

12:11.898 --> 12:15.318
Oh no, my favorite dress!

12:15.402 --> 12:17.070
Is not burnt?

12:17.153 --> 12:18.988
Well, of course it's not!

12:19.072 --> 12:21.866
I made it with a natural
flame retardant.

12:22.951 --> 12:24.619
But you know what is burnt?

12:24.703 --> 12:26.621
These cookies!

12:26.705 --> 12:29.499
Maybe they could
use some salt!

12:31.459 --> 12:34.129
I wonder how far
I can throw this!

12:34.212 --> 12:36.673
-[wood chipper whirring]
-Watch out! I have a wood chipper!

12:44.222 --> 12:46.182
It's not ruined?!

12:46.266 --> 12:48.601
That's 'cause it's made
with natural fibers.

12:48.685 --> 12:49.936
And love!

12:54.149 --> 12:55.525
Hey!

12:55.608 --> 12:57.235
Guess who just had
his first paying gig

12:57.318 --> 12:58.486
as a magician?

12:58.570 --> 12:59.988
No way, Bernie!

13:00.071 --> 13:01.031
That's amazing!

13:01.114 --> 13:04.284
Yep! I had a killer set
at the old folks' home.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.119
And the two people
who stayed awake

13:06.202 --> 13:08.455
said it was, and I quote,

13:08.538 --> 13:09.873
"When's Bingo?"

13:11.791 --> 13:13.960
Look at you!
You're glowing!

13:14.044 --> 13:15.462
Yeah, it's mostly sweat.

13:17.255 --> 13:19.341
But like any
professional magician,

13:19.424 --> 13:21.509
I came up with an
amazing stage name.

13:21.593 --> 13:25.013
I am... Illusor!

13:26.181 --> 13:27.474
Uh, yeah.

13:27.557 --> 13:29.642
You might want to consider
a different nickname.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.563
Nah, it's money.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.483
Hey, Paige!

13:36.566 --> 13:39.819
Hey! You look so... happy.

13:39.903 --> 13:42.280
Yeah! Frankie helped me
launch a charity.

13:42.364 --> 13:44.324
It's called "Half Your Stuff."

13:44.407 --> 13:45.909
We all have too many things,

13:45.992 --> 13:48.119
so why not give
half of them away?

13:48.203 --> 13:49.954
Thanks to my honesty,

13:50.038 --> 13:51.581
Zane found his true calling.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.124
Well...

13:53.208 --> 13:55.210
I have news, too.

13:55.293 --> 13:58.963
Bernie, here,
is so good at magic,

13:59.047 --> 14:01.091
he's been hired to
perform professionally.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.801
I opened for Bingo.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.762
Okay.

14:06.971 --> 14:09.057
Well, not only has Zane become

14:09.140 --> 14:10.767
a respected philanthropist,

14:10.850 --> 14:14.813
he is also going to
host a black-tie event

14:14.896 --> 14:16.439
to raise money
for his charity.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.733
-I am?
-You sure are!

14:18.817 --> 14:20.819
Well, that's great news,

14:20.902 --> 14:22.946
because Bernie can
perform his magic,

14:23.029 --> 14:25.073
and be the event's
entertainment.

14:25.156 --> 14:27.283
-I can?
-You sure can!

14:27.367 --> 14:28.535
Then it's settled.

14:28.618 --> 14:29.953
Zane will host an event,

14:30.036 --> 14:30.912
and Bernie will perform at it.

14:30.995 --> 14:33.039
And at the end, we'll see
whose life is better

14:33.123 --> 14:35.000
and that will determine
the winner.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.167
Of what?

14:36.251 --> 14:37.961
Um...

14:38.044 --> 14:39.713
the big game.

14:39.796 --> 14:41.840
Yeah, that is coming up.

14:43.133 --> 14:45.051
Hey! At this event,
I can debut my new trick.

14:45.135 --> 14:46.928
The Devil's Refrigerator.

14:47.012 --> 14:48.346
Oh, cool!
What do you do?

14:48.430 --> 14:50.598
Like make
a refrigerator disappear?

14:50.682 --> 14:53.101
[scoffs] Maybe if I was
a baby magician!

14:53.184 --> 14:55.103
This trick is
a death-defying illusion

14:55.186 --> 14:57.939
where a 1,000-pound refrigerator
hangs above the stage,

14:58.023 --> 15:00.066
dropping onto a box
that I'll be inside,

15:00.150 --> 15:01.192
and crushing me,

15:01.276 --> 15:03.111
unless I can escape in time.

15:04.195 --> 15:07.282
Ha!
That sounds very, um...

15:07.365 --> 15:08.450
advanced.

15:08.533 --> 15:10.744
Yeah! Only eight magicians
have ever tried it.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.287
So, they'll teach it to you?

15:12.370 --> 15:13.705
I wish!

15:13.788 --> 15:15.957
Unfortunately, only
two of them survived.

15:16.041 --> 15:18.585
And they both lost use
of their vocal cords.

15:18.668 --> 15:21.379
Uh, because they screamed
after completing the trick?

15:21.463 --> 15:23.089
I wish!

15:23.173 --> 15:24.924
It's because the box
crushed their throats.

15:25.842 --> 15:27.886
Thanks for booking me
this gig, Paige.

15:27.969 --> 15:28.928
Come on, Zane!

15:31.222 --> 15:33.600
Ah! The misguided optimism

15:33.683 --> 15:35.602
of a guy who's about to
have his throat crushed

15:35.685 --> 15:37.312
by a refrigerator.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.147
Well! See ya at the big game.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.822
Wow! Look at this place.

15:47.906 --> 15:49.240
Yeah. Told you
I'd hook you up.

15:49.324 --> 15:51.951
I asked Liam to call in favors
from his wealthiest friends,

15:52.035 --> 15:53.244
and he couldn't say no.

15:53.328 --> 15:54.496
I mean, he did.

15:54.579 --> 15:56.373
Several times,
but finally he said,

15:56.456 --> 15:58.333
"Ugh! Fine!"

16:00.585 --> 16:03.963
And now for the ceremonial
hoisting of the fridge.

16:04.047 --> 16:05.006
-[hydraulics whirring]
-Um...

16:06.174 --> 16:09.177
Bernie, are you-- are you sure this trick
isn't too dangerous?

16:09.260 --> 16:11.805
Actually, I don't think
this trick is dangerous enough.

16:11.888 --> 16:13.390
Which is why I filled the refrigerator

16:13.473 --> 16:14.683
with knives!

16:16.059 --> 16:18.103
-Butter knives?
-Of course!

16:18.186 --> 16:20.563
-Oh! Phew.
-Wait. Did you say "butter" or "butcher"?

16:20.647 --> 16:21.773
'Cause it's
definitely butcher.

16:24.109 --> 16:25.276
There's still time
to be honest with him

16:25.360 --> 16:26.569
before he goes
through with this.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.363
No! I can't discourage him now.

16:28.446 --> 16:29.572
If I tell him
he can't do the trick,

16:29.656 --> 16:31.157
it would destroy him!

16:31.241 --> 16:34.119
More than a refrigerator
filled with butcher knives?

16:34.202 --> 16:36.204
Oh, you heard that?

16:36.287 --> 16:38.039
Look, if I keep
being supportive,

16:38.123 --> 16:40.041
maybe somehow,
everything will work out fine.

16:40.125 --> 16:42.043
I believe in you, Bernie.

16:42.127 --> 16:43.128
Thanks, Paige!

16:43.211 --> 16:44.504
That means the world to me.

16:47.966 --> 16:49.134
[groans]

16:50.093 --> 16:51.136
Aw, man!

16:51.219 --> 16:54.139
It's the second mannequin
I've lost this month!

16:55.098 --> 16:58.143
So, the mannequin represents you?

16:58.226 --> 16:59.310
Oh, yeah!

16:59.394 --> 17:02.105
Bernie, you know you don't have to do
this trick at the event!

17:02.188 --> 17:03.606
Why don't you just
do your coin trick?

17:03.690 --> 17:06.568
Paige, please!
That's way too dangerous!

17:06.651 --> 17:08.069
Don't worry.
I got this.

17:08.153 --> 17:09.738
Most magicians would quit,

17:09.821 --> 17:11.072
but lucky for us,

17:11.156 --> 17:13.992
I am Illusor!

17:18.413 --> 17:21.666
And then I fire this baby
up to maximum scorch,

17:21.750 --> 17:23.710
and it's bye-bye ugly dress!

17:23.793 --> 17:27.005
Ha! Man,
I'm a good chaperone!

17:28.089 --> 17:29.049
You know what, Grandma?

17:29.132 --> 17:30.592
Don't bother.

17:30.675 --> 17:33.136
I'm sure whatever you do,
the dress will survive.

17:33.219 --> 17:37.349
I just wish Amelia knew
how awful this dress was.

17:37.432 --> 17:40.352
Yeah. Too bad you don't
have one in her size.

17:40.435 --> 17:42.854
Her size?!

17:42.937 --> 17:45.190
Grandma, how are
your sewing skills?

17:45.273 --> 17:46.608
Terrible!

17:46.691 --> 17:48.276
You know,

17:48.360 --> 17:50.653
you really haven't helped me
as much as I hoped you would.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.285
So, what do you think?

17:57.369 --> 18:00.121
I think it's...

18:00.205 --> 18:02.290
It definitely has--

18:02.374 --> 18:04.167
There's a certain--

18:04.250 --> 18:06.086
Don't be afraid
to hurt my feelings.

18:06.169 --> 18:07.587
It itches so bad!

18:07.671 --> 18:10.423
It feels like someone is
stabbing me in the back.

18:10.507 --> 18:13.093
It's so heavy,
I can't breathe,

18:13.176 --> 18:15.387
but so light, I'm freezing.

18:17.013 --> 18:19.933
Oh my gosh, there's
an ugly potato in the room.

18:20.016 --> 18:20.850
[gasps]

18:21.226 --> 18:23.269
Oh my gosh, it's me!

18:23.353 --> 18:24.562
[giggles]

18:25.605 --> 18:28.274
You hated that dress
all along, didn't you?

18:28.358 --> 18:29.693
Just the time that
I was wearing it,

18:29.776 --> 18:31.820
holding it, or looking at it.

18:31.903 --> 18:33.530
Great.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.949
Let's agree never
to wear them again.

18:36.032 --> 18:37.492
It's a deal, 'Mels.

18:37.575 --> 18:39.869
But how are we
gonna get rid of them?

18:39.953 --> 18:42.205
They're literally
indestructible.

18:43.331 --> 18:44.708
I have an idea.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.046
They're dead to me.

18:50.130 --> 18:51.756
Bing! Bang! Boom! Done!

18:53.049 --> 18:55.677
How much time have you been
spending with Grandma?

18:55.760 --> 18:57.262
Too much.

19:02.392 --> 19:05.311
Have I told you yet
how fabulous you look?

19:05.395 --> 19:06.771
Yes, you have!

19:06.855 --> 19:09.899
And have you told me yet
how fabulous I look?

19:09.983 --> 19:11.443
Clearly not enough.

19:13.528 --> 19:15.613
-[dramatic music]
-[applause]

19:18.283 --> 19:22.203
I hope you're all enjoying the
Half Your Stuff Charity Event.

19:22.287 --> 19:23.872
Thanks for your generosity.

19:23.955 --> 19:25.874
We've already received

19:25.957 --> 19:27.709
so many donations.

19:27.792 --> 19:28.626
[applause]

19:30.253 --> 19:32.255
I'm about to make a donation.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.715
To my purse!

19:35.467 --> 19:37.302
It's for charity.

19:37.385 --> 19:38.845
Kids need rolls.

19:41.056 --> 19:42.015
Hey, Paige.

19:42.098 --> 19:44.225
I'd like you to meet
my assistant, Tiffany!

19:44.309 --> 19:45.518
She's gonna be
helping me do the trick.

19:45.602 --> 19:47.395
Also, if things go wrong,

19:47.479 --> 19:49.481
she cleans up
the mess for free.

19:49.564 --> 19:53.234
[Zane over speaker]
<i>Please welcome Bernie Schotz.</i>

19:53.318 --> 19:54.152
[applause]

19:54.402 --> 19:55.236
[stammering]

19:56.946 --> 19:58.323
Good luck out there, Bernie,

19:58.406 --> 19:59.407
and just FYI,

19:59.491 --> 20:00.658
I heard a lot
of people talking about

20:00.742 --> 20:03.036
how they would like
to see a coin trick tonight.

20:04.371 --> 20:05.205
[dramatic music plays]

20:07.082 --> 20:08.291
Good evening.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.752
It feels good to give back.

20:10.835 --> 20:13.254
-[mysterious music plays]
-But you know what I can't give back?

20:13.338 --> 20:14.214
-This crate.
-[crowd gasps]

20:15.840 --> 20:17.342
Because I ordered it online,

20:17.425 --> 20:18.968
and have no idea
how to return it.

20:19.052 --> 20:19.886
[crowd gasps]

20:20.178 --> 20:21.888
I know.

20:21.971 --> 20:24.474
In a moment,
this crate will be crushed

20:24.557 --> 20:25.725
with me inside,

20:25.809 --> 20:28.353
in a trick that
many have tried,

20:28.436 --> 20:30.146
but few have survived.

20:30.230 --> 20:32.774
The Devil's Refrigerator!

20:32.857 --> 20:33.692
[crowd gasping]

20:34.943 --> 20:36.736
You're not gonna
stop him?

20:36.820 --> 20:39.197
You're really gonna
let Bernie go out there

20:39.280 --> 20:40.865
and hurt himself just
to prove you're right?

20:40.949 --> 20:43.243
I really think
everything's gonna be fine.

20:43.326 --> 20:44.327
Are you serious?

20:44.411 --> 20:46.079
Paige, I think you're in denial.

20:46.162 --> 20:47.706
There's nothing
to worry about.

20:47.789 --> 20:49.374
I mean, maybe he won't
even get in the crate.

20:49.457 --> 20:51.626
I am in the crate!

20:53.003 --> 20:55.046
Maybe they won't be able
to put the fridge in position.

20:55.130 --> 20:57.590
The fridge is in position.

20:58.883 --> 21:01.428
I mean, it's not like he's
past the point of no return.

21:01.511 --> 21:04.347
I am past the point
of no return.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.684
Paige! Paige,
Paige, Paige! Paige!

21:07.767 --> 21:08.893
What am I doing?!

21:10.645 --> 21:12.230
Bernie, stop!
You can't do this trick!

21:12.313 --> 21:14.065
You're not ready,
and it's too hard!

21:14.149 --> 21:15.483
Or is it?

21:15.567 --> 21:17.444
No, stop!
Bernie, wait, stop!

21:17.527 --> 21:19.446
-[crowd gasps]
-Bernie, stop!

21:27.037 --> 21:27.871
[crowd exclaims]

21:28.538 --> 21:30.123
My grandson!

21:31.541 --> 21:32.625
Wow!

21:32.709 --> 21:35.712
I don't know how anyone
could have survived that!

21:35.795 --> 21:38.173
[applause]

21:40.467 --> 21:42.010
Gosh, you're alive!

21:42.093 --> 21:44.304
How in the world
did you do that trick?

21:44.387 --> 21:46.181
Easy. I cut a hole
in the stage.

21:46.264 --> 21:47.932
So while everyone was
looking at the refrigerator,

21:48.016 --> 21:49.851
I crawled out and
snuck up to that table.

21:49.934 --> 21:53.146
Oh! Uh, I thought magicians weren't
supposed to reveal their secrets.

21:53.229 --> 21:55.398
Well, I'm not a magician.

21:55.482 --> 21:58.902
I'm Illusor.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.570
He doesn't hear it?

22:00.653 --> 22:02.113
He doesn't hear it.

22:03.114 --> 22:04.115
Bernard.

22:04.199 --> 22:07.452
I'm so happy you're alive! Oh!

22:07.535 --> 22:11.247
Well, looks like you're
gonna be wearing this.

22:11.331 --> 22:12.499
Thanks to my
encouragement,

22:12.582 --> 22:14.834
Bernie became
an amazing magician.

22:14.918 --> 22:15.960
I was right.

22:16.044 --> 22:19.756
No. You're gonna wear this.

22:19.839 --> 22:22.425
My honesty had Zane

22:22.509 --> 22:24.844
pull off this
entire charity event.

22:24.928 --> 22:26.388
I was right.

22:26.471 --> 22:27.931
Hmm.

22:28.014 --> 22:30.100
Is it possible that the result of our
little experiment

22:30.183 --> 22:31.267
was we're both right?

22:31.351 --> 22:32.185
Hmm. [chuckles]

22:33.019 --> 22:34.562
"We were both right"
high-five!

22:35.855 --> 22:37.107
Wait, I'm sorry.

22:37.190 --> 22:38.983
What experiment?

22:39.067 --> 22:39.901
[both]
Uh...

22:41.277 --> 22:43.488
Wait, were you two
just using us

22:43.571 --> 22:45.115
to settle a personal score?

22:45.198 --> 22:47.575
No, no, no, no.
See, you guys don't understand.

22:47.659 --> 22:49.828
We were both right!

22:51.204 --> 22:53.581
Hi! We were wrong.

22:53.665 --> 22:55.417
Hi! Lovely dress.
We were wrong.
