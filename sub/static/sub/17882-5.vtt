WEBVTT

00:06.763 --> 00:09.323
What's up, my muggle?
Hey, I got something for you.

00:09.433 --> 00:11.639
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! What are you doin'?

00:11.763 --> 00:13.722
Oh, me and my boy--
We're gonna get together this weekend

00:13.848 --> 00:14.980
and have a "Harry Potter"-thon.

00:15.087 --> 00:17.421
We're gonna kick back, pound
down some butterbeers,

00:17.548 --> 00:19.784
watch Hermione blossom into wizardhood,

00:19.898 --> 00:22.739
but not in a creepy way.
I have no idea what you just said,

00:22.864 --> 00:24.816
but how about we grab some real beers

00:24.956 --> 00:26.099
and watch the Laker game?

00:26.216 --> 00:27.955
No, well, that's cool, man.
I don't have a dad.

00:28.081 --> 00:30.860
Maybe some other time.
Lose yourself, baby.

00:31.026 --> 00:33.213
Lose yourself. Just you and me.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.505
And me.
Here's the specs you wanted, Mel.

00:35.621 --> 00:38.398
Oh, jeez. Sorry. I gotta get back to work.

00:38.530 --> 00:40.442
Baby, that was crazy good, though.
Yeah?

00:40.567 --> 00:43.770
Yeah. You know what's crazy gooder?
This sweet j-o-b.

00:43.888 --> 00:44.924
I mean, now that we work together,

00:45.055 --> 00:48.138
it's like we're being paid
to hang out 24/siete.

00:48.259 --> 00:51.810
If you need me, I'll be right in here.

00:56.705 --> 00:58.862
Sweet, thoughtful bastard.

00:58.987 --> 01:01.373
And it sucks for you, 'cause
he's the best boyfriend ever.

01:01.498 --> 01:04.402
Yet there he is, tongue-holing a doughnut.

01:05.602 --> 01:07.657
Oh, God.

01:14.833 --> 01:17.078
Okay, down to business.

01:17.303 --> 01:18.934
This weekend is Comic-Con,

01:19.049 --> 01:20.951
and we've been hired by a
Hollywood movie studio

01:21.056 --> 01:24.408
to protect a film they're going
to screen for 100 lucky virgins.

01:24.538 --> 01:27.344
It's the sequel to some '80s
movie called "The Goobers"

01:27.463 --> 01:29.104
or something.
"The Goonies"?

01:29.233 --> 01:33.812
You have "Goonies 2: The Legend
of Sloth" here in our office?

01:34.436 --> 01:36.525
Mm. Nerdgasm.

01:36.635 --> 01:37.314
All right, listen up.

01:37.446 --> 01:40.541
This exclusive screening has
created quite the backlash,

01:40.656 --> 01:42.880
and the studio's been receiving
a lot of angry threats

01:42.996 --> 01:46.558
from fanboys vowing to steal
it because they feel excluded.

01:46.691 --> 01:49.550
Isn't it just a kids' movie?
Kids' movie?

01:49.675 --> 01:51.375
It's the geek Holy Grail.

01:51.498 --> 01:53.478
Truffle shuffle, baby.

01:53.706 --> 01:55.284
What are you doing?
Why are you l--

01:59.068 --> 02:02.102
I have no idea what that means,
but I know your jobs are

02:02.236 --> 02:04.177
to ensure safe delivery of this film.

02:04.301 --> 02:06.924
My job is to tan your hides if you fail.

02:07.046 --> 02:09.568
Now the fans are rabid and mobilized.

02:09.679 --> 02:11.481
They have vowed to steal
the movie, so you've gotta

02:11.592 --> 02:15.267
protect it at all costs.
We have to be discreet.

02:15.551 --> 02:17.773
Now this DVD is heavily encrypted.

02:17.877 --> 02:19.990
It can't be copied, but
we can't be too safe.

02:20.115 --> 02:21.771
Melanie, I need you to design

02:21.893 --> 02:24.200
a secure transport case for this DVD.

02:24.334 --> 02:28.835
Maybe secure it with a bra clasp
so the nerds can't get into it.

02:28.960 --> 02:32.425
Dutch-down! Josh, we're gonna
need you in one of your disguises

02:32.525 --> 02:34.962
so you can be our eyes and
ears on the Comic-Con floor.

02:35.076 --> 02:37.206
And no, I will not pay for a Batmobile.

02:37.332 --> 02:41.098
Ooh! Okay, now me. Now me. What's my job?
Your job is gonna be

02:41.196 --> 02:43.610
in the van with me,
monitoring security feed.

02:43.729 --> 02:46.617
Cameron, your job is gonna
be to hand-deliver the film,

02:46.749 --> 02:48.227
stay there until they finish the screening,

02:48.332 --> 02:49.964
then return it here to contra safely.

02:50.083 --> 02:52.402
What?! Why does Cam get the best job ever?

02:52.525 --> 02:55.684
I mean, the Con is my world!
I'm an expert at this.

02:55.804 --> 02:57.758
I even self-published
my own superhero comic.

02:57.868 --> 03:00.633
Yes, we all know about Black Zeus--

03:00.754 --> 03:03.243
Rapper by day, secret agent by night.

03:06.470 --> 03:08.448
Who raps during the day?

03:08.580 --> 03:11.047
You are too close to this.
It's like my daddy always said--

03:11.183 --> 03:13.750
Don't give the pill popper
keys to the pharmacy.

03:13.910 --> 03:16.719
He was a pill popper... and a pharmacist.

03:16.842 --> 03:18.430
Do we, uh, at least get to watch it?

03:18.553 --> 03:19.978
Yes, in the theaters, with everyone else.

03:20.114 --> 03:22.413
Now hand over the DVD you just swiped.

03:24.672 --> 03:27.009
Three years of Magic Camp for nothin'!

03:27.186 --> 03:30.831
Well, not really for nothin'.
I made a lot of lifelong friends.

03:32.290 --> 03:33.989
Hey, what the hell was that?

03:34.164 --> 03:36.125
What? You didn't have my
back in there with Oz.

03:36.262 --> 03:38.810
I mean, we're boys. We share jobs, kidneys,

03:38.927 --> 03:40.979
superlong noodles,
"Lady and the Tramp" style.

03:41.106 --> 03:42.612
I think you're very confused right now.

03:42.735 --> 03:44.518
I am, 'cause our boss is

03:44.652 --> 03:46.265
the most unfair man on the planet.

03:46.409 --> 03:48.491
I hate to say it, but I
kind of agree with him.

03:48.616 --> 03:51.689
What? You know this is important to me.

03:51.805 --> 03:53.005
"Goonies" is my thing.

03:53.132 --> 03:57.412
I mean, you haven't even seen the movie.
Name one Goonie.

03:57.809 --> 03:58.988
Gary Goonie.

03:59.127 --> 04:01.486
Gary Goonie? Gary Goonie?!
Are you serious?!

04:01.618 --> 04:04.304
That right there is probably why
I'm the best man for the job.

04:04.421 --> 04:06.563
It's just a movie.
I'm telling you, as a friend,

04:06.668 --> 04:10.018
you gotta get a grip.
You get a grip! Okay, you're not my friend.

04:10.151 --> 04:11.481
You're my worst enemy, man.

04:11.616 --> 04:13.145
I'm outta here! I can't believe this!

04:13.477 --> 04:16.106
No! I can't believe it. Gary Goonie.

04:16.237 --> 04:18.003
I can't believe he said--
Really?!

04:18.125 --> 04:21.074
Here's your Gary Goonie. Here it is!
Gary Goonie! Cash. Ca--

04:21.175 --> 04:24.656
Gary Goonie?! You're dead to me!

04:32.842 --> 04:34.533
Hey. You're here early.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.627
Hey. Just trying to squeeze in
a little me time before--

04:37.749 --> 04:40.131
There she is!
Why didn't you wake me up, Boo?

04:40.240 --> 04:41.566
I was gonna make us some brekkie.

04:41.681 --> 04:43.444
It's egg white Wednesday. Come on.

04:43.564 --> 04:45.774
We'll read each other some comics.
Yay.

04:45.914 --> 04:49.708
Come on.
Whoo-hoo! A cup of Joe, toots?

04:49.841 --> 04:51.276
Oh. Thanks.

04:51.402 --> 04:55.777
Coffee is for winners.
And guess whose cover got blown.

04:55.897 --> 04:58.818
Ours. The fanboys have all been tipped off,

04:58.944 --> 05:01.799
and they'll be gunning for us.
Our faces are everywhere.

05:01.921 --> 05:03.242
Well, your faces.

05:03.368 --> 05:05.922
It's virtually impossible to
capture my likeness on camera--

05:06.051 --> 05:09.771
An old trick I learned from
a Zulu shaman named...

05:09.905 --> 05:12.466
That explains the pictures
from the company picnic.

05:18.709 --> 05:20.494
Tell me--
How are things going with Cash?

05:20.606 --> 05:22.404
I know he wasn't too
happy with either of us.

05:22.527 --> 05:25.159
Well, apparently my best friend
took the train to crazy town

05:25.269 --> 05:26.706
and is now my sworn enemy.

05:26.852 --> 05:28.573
Well, this job is very, very important,

05:28.715 --> 05:30.113
so you two lovebirds better work it out,

05:30.264 --> 05:31.894
or I'm gonna be forced
to work it out for you,

05:32.022 --> 05:34.177
and my version involves a car battery

05:34.317 --> 05:36.891
clamped to a certain body part.
I'll give you a hint.

05:37.031 --> 05:38.679
It rhymes with "mesticles."

05:40.194 --> 05:43.208
Hello? Hello?

05:44.126 --> 05:45.707
What the...

05:46.730 --> 05:47.894
What?

05:48.356 --> 05:51.282
It's got my ass! It's got my ass!
What?

05:57.380 --> 05:58.522
You done?

06:00.177 --> 06:01.947
Yes, I'm done.

06:04.897 --> 06:06.448
You.

06:08.266 --> 06:10.117
It's only just begun.

06:11.153 --> 06:14.873
Unless you tell Oz to give me your job.

06:14.994 --> 06:17.966
Hell, no. You want a prank war?
You got one.

06:18.084 --> 06:21.376
I'm gonna own you.
Pranking is my thing, bitch.

06:21.499 --> 06:23.129
Well, you're about to get
beat at your own thing,

06:23.259 --> 06:25.453
bitch.
Saying "bitch" is my thing, bitch.

06:25.572 --> 06:27.676
You can't have two things, bitch.

06:27.816 --> 06:31.555
Well, I do. Game, set, Cash.

06:32.004 --> 06:35.923
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch.

06:55.246 --> 06:58.426
Can I help you?
We saw your post all over hedo.com.

06:58.560 --> 07:00.437
We're here for the All Night Bang-athon.

07:01.011 --> 07:04.009
And the rippin' and the tearin'.
The rippin' and the tearin'.

07:05.287 --> 07:07.269
I'm tearin' off my clothes!

07:09.173 --> 07:10.555
Owned.

07:11.504 --> 07:13.186
Dude, I live with my mom, man.

07:13.331 --> 07:14.891
I mean, she had her church group over.

07:14.994 --> 07:16.380
I had to join the prayer circle.

07:16.503 --> 07:19.625
Stuff went down. It was, like,
this whole thing. So we even?

07:19.753 --> 07:22.583
We will be... once those boner pills

07:22.699 --> 07:24.215
I put in your coffee kick in.

07:24.329 --> 07:26.163
No. I think I would've seen you do that.

07:26.282 --> 07:28.008
Sleight of hand.

07:28.671 --> 07:30.208
Magic Camp.

07:30.325 --> 07:31.836
Sucka!

07:41.006 --> 07:42.460
Move!
What?

07:42.571 --> 07:43.633
I need to get under your desk.

07:43.751 --> 07:45.614
No! No, no, no, no. Any time but now.

07:45.744 --> 07:48.244
Yo, melon balls! Where are you, girl?

07:48.531 --> 07:50.266
Cam, what's up?

07:50.386 --> 07:53.298
Hey, I just saw a midget driving a car.

07:53.411 --> 07:55.652
Genius! Offensive.

07:55.814 --> 07:56.821
She gets it.

07:56.949 --> 07:59.702
Say, you seen my old lady?
No. No, no, no.

07:59.825 --> 08:01.272
Well, if you do, you tell
her I'm in the garage,

08:01.416 --> 08:04.421
working on the van.
I put some shag down in the back

08:04.551 --> 08:08.191
so me and Mel can put some
shag down in the back. Bump!

08:08.330 --> 08:10.384
Rebump. Bump-fecta.

08:10.498 --> 08:12.980
Please go.
You betcha.

08:20.123 --> 08:22.771
This isn't from you. It's from Cash.

08:23.617 --> 08:25.065
Okay. Sweetie.

08:31.322 --> 08:32.909
Ownage.

08:33.195 --> 08:35.177
Oh, baby's gonna tell on me.

08:35.308 --> 08:38.871
Baby's gonna tell on me, is he?

08:39.080 --> 08:41.251
Please don't tell on me.
Oz, I've had enough.

08:41.371 --> 08:44.222
Ever since we got this case,
Cash has been acting insane.

08:44.349 --> 08:46.763
Watch.
Gary Goonie. Gary Goonie. I'll kill you.

08:46.880 --> 08:48.634
See, I can't work with this guy.
Well,

08:48.765 --> 08:50.887
if that's how you feel,
Cash, you are off the case.

08:51.005 --> 08:52.818
What? Wait. I can't even sit in the van

08:52.941 --> 08:55.091
when we're at Comic-Con?
We don't need two people in there.

08:55.204 --> 08:57.262
Stay here. Man the office.

08:59.138 --> 09:00.522
Looks like you won, man.

09:00.646 --> 09:03.085
Congrats. Hope it feels good.

09:06.561 --> 09:07.678
You are sporting a wicked--

09:07.784 --> 09:10.903
Yes. Save that excitement for Comic-Con.

09:11.244 --> 09:12.741
Let's go.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.466
All right, ladies, look alive.

09:28.594 --> 09:31.345
Cambo, the DVD is stashed in your cart.

09:31.464 --> 09:32.786
Roger that. I'm heading in.

09:35.298 --> 09:36.959
Josh, you're my eyes and ears out there.

09:37.074 --> 09:38.454
You see anything weird?

09:39.027 --> 09:42.016
Um, you mean besides everything?

09:42.137 --> 09:44.918
Yeah, I'm talking about the movie.
Any chatter? Goonies!

09:45.046 --> 09:46.826
Well, hall "A" is completely surrounded

09:46.961 --> 09:49.160
with angry goonheads trying
to get into that screening.

09:49.290 --> 09:50.650
We're gonna have to watch our step in here.

09:50.780 --> 09:53.025
Give us "Goonies," or give us death!

09:53.138 --> 09:54.438
Yeah!

09:54.558 --> 09:57.088
10-4. Cameron, I'll reroute you.

09:57.221 --> 09:59.257
Melanie, where you at
with the security feed?

09:59.388 --> 10:00.794
Patching in now.

10:11.937 --> 10:14.487
'Sup, gorgeous? Check out what I got.

10:14.610 --> 10:16.752
Boom! What are you doing here?

10:16.878 --> 10:17.874
You're supposed to be in the van.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.071
Yeah, Oz has got it under control.

10:19.195 --> 10:20.116
I thought I'd keep you company.

10:20.250 --> 10:22.355
Still not patched in, Mel.
Shake a leg.

10:22.484 --> 10:24.234
Yeah, I'm handling it.
Whoa.

10:24.917 --> 10:27.211
What's with the peanuts?
You know I'm crazy allergic.

10:27.355 --> 10:30.497
I know. You're not supposed to be here.
Today, peaches!

10:30.623 --> 10:32.109
I'm handling it.

10:32.244 --> 10:34.524
Look, this is my cover,
and you're blowing it.

10:34.674 --> 10:37.930
Will you just--just give me some space
for once, please?

10:38.074 --> 10:42.054
What--what are you trying to say?
She's saying back off, bro.

10:42.196 --> 10:44.495
Trust me. I know women.
Hey, I'm Jared.

10:44.626 --> 10:47.389
You know what, Mel?
Gobble all the peanuts you want.

10:47.501 --> 10:49.293
Jam your mouth full of peanuts.

10:49.435 --> 10:54.485
Rub peanuts all over yourself
for all I care. Later, Thor.

10:54.717 --> 10:56.048
Dutch!

10:56.232 --> 10:57.599
Thank you.

10:58.619 --> 11:00.735
About time.
All right, Cammy,

11:01.026 --> 11:03.694
screening room is 80
yards to your northeast.

11:03.836 --> 11:06.114
Look alive, people.
There's been an Adam West sighting.

11:06.227 --> 11:08.372
A bunch of caped nerds are headed your way.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.297
Okay, calm down!

11:12.219 --> 11:13.930
Jeez, guys, it's just Adam West.

11:14.052 --> 11:15.366
Calm down!

11:18.454 --> 11:20.897
Okay, I'm at the door of
the screening room now.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.061
Looks like you're all clear.

11:22.181 --> 11:23.399
Bring it on home.

11:27.938 --> 11:29.222
Oh, no.

11:29.665 --> 11:31.782
Cameron, where's that DVD?
Oh, no.

11:31.898 --> 11:33.488
Warming up the car battery.

11:36.935 --> 11:39.458
I've got a $100 million movie
lost, the studio freaking out,

11:39.459 --> 11:42.478
and this company's reputation--
my reputation--on the line.

11:42.479 --> 11:45.514
I know. Whoever stole the DVD
is on that security footage.

11:45.515 --> 11:46.970
I'm gonna look over every inch of it.

11:46.971 --> 11:49.134
You better or you're gonna
start looking for another job.

11:49.150 --> 11:51.259
Make like a pair of ta-tas and bounce.

11:51.260 --> 11:52.330
Okay.

11:59.857 --> 12:01.867
Dude, what the--
Do you know what time it is?

12:01.868 --> 12:03.903
My mom has to be at the courthouse at 6:00.

12:03.904 --> 12:05.741
Oh. Why does she have to go to court?

12:05.742 --> 12:07.659
'Cause she's the judge, racist.

12:08.550 --> 12:11.467
Look, I spent the last five hours
going through security footage,

12:11.468 --> 12:13.592
and you won't believe what I found...

12:14.104 --> 12:17.192
...You.
I don't recall Oz asking you to be there.

12:17.193 --> 12:20.447
Well, I was, as a registered guest,

12:20.448 --> 12:23.289
'cause my ex-best friend
got me kicked off the job.

12:23.290 --> 12:24.795
So this was your plan to get back at me?

12:24.796 --> 12:25.836
'Cause from where I'm standing,

12:25.837 --> 12:27.589
it sure looks like another
one of your pranks.

12:27.590 --> 12:29.544
Are you implying that I stole the movie?

12:29.545 --> 12:31.600
I'm without a doubt saying
you stole the movie.

12:31.601 --> 12:33.595
What makes you think I would
do something like that?

12:34.121 --> 12:36.520
Now hand over the DVD you just swiped.

12:36.521 --> 12:37.687
Gary Goonie. Gary Goonie.

12:37.688 --> 12:39.153
I'll kill you.

12:40.450 --> 12:41.911
But you know what'd be awesome?

12:41.912 --> 12:43.344
Stealing that movie.

12:43.741 --> 12:45.459
Listen, I may be mad at you,

12:45.460 --> 12:47.411
but I'm not gonna sabotage my own team.

12:48.116 --> 12:49.605
Look me in the eyes.

12:49.677 --> 12:52.259
Tell me you believe I did
not steal that movie.

12:54.324 --> 12:56.198
Sorry, Cash. Not buying it.

12:56.798 --> 12:58.879
Dude, you're a crappy friend, man.

12:58.967 --> 13:01.027
And to think, I invited you
to watch "Harry Potter"

13:01.028 --> 13:02.842
'cause I thought you were my Ron Weasley.

13:03.098 --> 13:06.260
But it turns out you're nothing
more than a professor Snape!

13:06.523 --> 13:08.374
No idea what any of that means.

13:08.375 --> 13:09.756
That means get out of my house.

13:10.053 --> 13:10.740
Garage.

13:10.741 --> 13:13.496
It has a mini fridge and a front door.
Makes it a house.

13:13.595 --> 13:15.016
Oh, yeah.
No, totally.

13:15.734 --> 13:16.687
Ooh!

13:16.744 --> 13:17.749
Really?

13:22.164 --> 13:23.435
Garage.

13:26.020 --> 13:27.487
Good morning.

13:28.770 --> 13:30.602
Dude, why are you still wearing that?

13:31.100 --> 13:32.936
Actually, never took it off.

13:33.140 --> 13:34.664
Met a smurf at Comic-Con,

13:34.665 --> 13:38.383
and I smurfed the smurf out
of her, all smurf long.

13:38.917 --> 13:41.734
Well, I'm so happy you had a great night.

13:41.735 --> 13:44.172
Me? Not so much.

13:45.066 --> 13:48.191
Hey, babe. I'm sorry about that.
I was just grabbing a quick...

13:48.586 --> 13:50.394
What are you doing?

13:50.553 --> 13:51.840
Where have you been?

13:52.492 --> 13:55.091
I hand-rolled the Sushi myself!

13:56.004 --> 13:59.040
It was supposed to be a peace
offering served on my rock-hard abs.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.988
All this unagi ruined!

14:02.954 --> 14:04.779
He makes you breakfast and dinner?

14:05.482 --> 14:08.191
Wow. He really is a good boyfriend.

14:09.848 --> 14:11.278
Smurf off.

14:14.561 --> 14:16.364
Hey, Cam. I was just thinking about you.

14:16.365 --> 14:17.725
Okay, before you give me a jump,

14:17.726 --> 14:19.663
you should know I think I
found out who stole the DVD.

14:19.850 --> 14:21.981
Cash.
Yes, I spoke to him this morning.

14:21.982 --> 14:24.200
Now while I appreciate the enthusiasm,

14:24.201 --> 14:27.555
accusing your friend of grand larceny
is sort of a dick move, if you ask me.

14:27.556 --> 14:30.202
All right, but you--you saw that Cash
was at Comic-Con.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.126
You saw the footage, right?
Yes,

14:31.127 --> 14:33.609
the only difference is I watched all of it.

14:33.610 --> 14:35.991
You were so excited that
Cash was at the Con,

14:35.992 --> 14:37.547
you got conned yourself.

14:39.573 --> 14:42.837
There. Right there in the
nerd stampede for Adam West,

14:42.838 --> 14:44.227
that's where the mutant turtle struck.

14:44.585 --> 14:46.558
You know where Cash was during all this?

14:50.483 --> 14:52.497
Sharing a funnel cake with
what appears to be a Norse God

14:52.498 --> 14:54.070
who's eating his feelings.

14:54.071 --> 14:55.906
Oh, my God. Cash was right.

14:55.907 --> 14:56.800
That's the good news.

14:56.801 --> 14:59.951
The bad news is our thief made a web
site that went live this morning.

15:00.799 --> 15:04.296
In eight hours, he promises to upload
the stolen movie for the world to see.

15:04.297 --> 15:05.936
Now if we don't track this guy,

15:06.105 --> 15:07.884
the studio's holding us responsible.

15:07.885 --> 15:10.021
So how are we going to fix this?

15:10.158 --> 15:13.067
We can't, but I know who can.

15:14.017 --> 15:15.944
Can I get everyone's attention, please?

15:16.495 --> 15:19.284
Last night, I accused a good
friend of something he didn't do.

15:20.183 --> 15:22.723
Truth is, I hacked my way into college,

15:22.724 --> 15:24.448
where I hid out for the last seven years.

15:24.449 --> 15:26.879
I was fine with not
having any real friends,

15:27.177 --> 15:31.153
and being so set in my ways
has caused me to hurt someone

15:31.829 --> 15:33.317
I really care about.

15:34.524 --> 15:37.246
And for that... I'm sorry.

15:38.796 --> 15:42.124
Look, we have five hours
to get this movie back,

15:42.125 --> 15:44.656
and that may seem
impossible, but not for us.

15:45.099 --> 15:47.278
All right, this is our time!

15:47.427 --> 15:50.160
It's our time in here, and you know why?

15:50.765 --> 15:52.778
Because goonies never say "Die."

15:55.005 --> 15:56.561
You watched the movie?

15:57.463 --> 15:59.249
Does this answer your question?

15:59.259 --> 16:02.456
No. Don't...
Don't do that unless you mean it.

16:02.663 --> 16:04.211
Truffle shuffle, baby.

16:25.458 --> 16:26.649
That was beautiful.

16:30.570 --> 16:32.099
All right, buddy.

16:32.100 --> 16:33.794
There's only one person who can get inside

16:33.795 --> 16:35.468
the mind of the geek who stole this movie.

16:36.750 --> 16:39.033
This seems like a job for Black Zeus.

16:40.661 --> 16:43.372
The Zeus is loose.

16:46.676 --> 16:48.278
That's his catchphrase.

16:55.534 --> 16:58.802
All right, so I've gamed up
every possible situation,

16:58.803 --> 17:00.239
and this is what I've come up with.

17:00.904 --> 17:03.210
Our thief is feeling pretty cool

17:03.211 --> 17:05.300
that he's seen something
that no one else has,

17:05.300 --> 17:09.602
but what would any geek want to
see more than a "Goonies" sequel?

17:09.835 --> 17:12.490
Only two things--
"Megan Fox

17:12.491 --> 17:14.934
Warrior Princess."

17:14.935 --> 17:18.852
So we give 'em both--
Megan Fox as Xena.

17:19.678 --> 17:21.357
The perfect storm.

17:21.376 --> 17:24.222
What if there was a pirated
rough cut of a Xena movie

17:24.223 --> 17:27.123
that no one knew about, and
we were willing to trade?

17:27.337 --> 17:29.652
No nerd alive would ever turn that down.

17:29.943 --> 17:32.428
But where are we gonna find
someone who looks like Megan Fox?

17:37.097 --> 17:39.078
Oh. Damn it.

17:39.567 --> 17:40.533
Fine.

17:40.534 --> 17:42.420
Where are you gonna find
a Xena costume on such--

17:43.150 --> 17:44.583
Damn it.

17:45.031 --> 17:46.681
And... action.

17:48.647 --> 17:49.943
I know you guys are fighting.

17:49.944 --> 17:52.578
Mel, you're feeling smothered,
but you guys gotta lock lips.

17:52.579 --> 17:55.865
Come on, guys. We need this.
Grab Hercules in your arms...

17:55.866 --> 17:58.714
And kiss him like your life depended on it.

17:58.868 --> 18:00.786
I mean, you just look so ridiculous.

18:00.905 --> 18:03.583
Yeah?
Yeah, and you look... hot.

18:06.864 --> 18:08.166
Baby, I'm an idiot.

18:08.167 --> 18:10.475
I know, but I love you anyway.

18:11.226 --> 18:13.276
24/siete, baby.

18:16.175 --> 18:19.047
All right, I think we got it.
I think we got it. Let's cut.

18:19.048 --> 18:21.192
No, let the scene play.

18:21.347 --> 18:24.556
Everybody, out! Get out! Out now! Go!

18:24.557 --> 18:26.316
Sparta!

18:28.820 --> 18:30.566
Okay, our thief really
knows what he's doing.

18:30.567 --> 18:32.655
His goonileaks web site is untraceable.

18:32.656 --> 18:34.662
But he's been all over the message boards,

18:34.663 --> 18:36.963
bragging about his conquest.
That's how we'll trap him.

18:37.069 --> 18:38.638
Did our little fishy take the bait?

18:39.194 --> 18:40.534
Oh, yeah.

18:40.861 --> 18:44.001
All right. Van's gassed up. Let's do this.

18:44.174 --> 18:46.787
Dude, what is wrong with your face?

18:46.788 --> 18:48.285
What's right with yours?

18:49.572 --> 18:51.153
Oh, my God.

18:52.167 --> 18:55.934
Baby, the Xena kiss.
I forgot about your peanut allergy.

18:56.064 --> 18:57.760
Let me see. Hey.

18:57.761 --> 18:59.046
I regret nothing.

18:59.349 --> 19:00.213
Oh.

19:03.668 --> 19:06.422
All right, Black Zeus, eyes open.
He's out there.

19:06.423 --> 19:07.466
Everyone in position?

19:07.538 --> 19:08.695
Check.

19:09.585 --> 19:10.763
Check.

19:11.970 --> 19:13.083
Check.

19:13.858 --> 19:14.857
Check.

19:15.442 --> 19:16.581
Check.

19:17.549 --> 19:20.113
Target acquired.
You got a tortoise on your tail.

19:20.337 --> 19:22.068
Don't be a hero, Cash.

19:22.403 --> 19:24.668
I'm gonna have turtle soup tonight.

19:34.982 --> 19:36.037
Okay.

19:36.599 --> 19:38.002
On three, we trade.

19:42.822 --> 19:43.643
Come on.
Hey.

19:43.644 --> 19:44.821
Wait your turn.

19:45.581 --> 19:48.272
One, two...

19:50.479 --> 19:53.055
Got a broken arrow. Go, go, go, go.

19:56.031 --> 19:58.617
Hey, you guys!

19:59.067 --> 20:01.711
That doesn't sound anything like Sloth.
This guy sucks!

20:05.090 --> 20:07.457
Go, go, go, go, go! Move! Move!

20:12.862 --> 20:13.993
Where is he? Where?

20:15.858 --> 20:18.224
Well, he shed his shell.
He could be anyone here,

20:18.225 --> 20:19.966
damn it.
He got away with both DVDs.

20:20.435 --> 20:21.453
Oh, did he?

20:22.739 --> 20:24.405
Sleight of hand.

20:25.610 --> 20:27.382
Magic Camp, suckas.

20:27.383 --> 20:29.792
Three, two, one.

20:30.773 --> 20:32.933
Yeah! And the countdown is over.

20:32.934 --> 20:35.410
We have the movie. Nice work, people.

20:35.430 --> 20:37.058
And I just got off the
horn with the studio.

20:37.059 --> 20:40.106
Not only did you rescue their
film from a mutant fanboy,

20:40.201 --> 20:42.974
but you garnered them a
ton of free publicity.

20:42.975 --> 20:46.904
If I had a tail, I'd be wagging it.
Cheers! Cheers!

20:48.032 --> 20:49.607
All right!
Hey, uh,

20:49.608 --> 20:50.959
you, uh, wanna hang tonight?

20:50.960 --> 20:53.206
Maybe grab a beer, watch the Laker game?

20:53.207 --> 20:57.856
No, I was thinking more along the
lines of "Harry Potter"-thon. You in?

20:58.141 --> 20:59.719
I'm in like Slytherin.

20:59.939 --> 21:02.743
All right. Warlocks, abracadabra,

21:02.874 --> 21:04.657
that kid from... I don't know.

21:05.074 --> 21:07.235
You're trying. That's good.
