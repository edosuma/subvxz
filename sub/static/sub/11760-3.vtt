00:03.040 --> 00:06.998
The Bible teaches us that all things
are possible to him that believeth.

00:07.080 --> 00:09.388
And I ask all of you...

00:09.480 --> 00:12.278
Do you believe in the power
of the Almighty Father?

00:16.239 --> 00:18.196
I know the Good Lord can hear.

00:19.640 --> 00:21.596
I witnessed a miracle first-hand.

00:22.679 --> 00:24.271
When I was 11 years old,

00:24.359 --> 00:26.554
the Devil himself came into our home

00:26.640 --> 00:28.596
and tried to take my little sister Jane.

00:29.480 --> 00:31.710
She was dying of pneumonia.

00:31.800 --> 00:34.792
The doctors told my parents
there was nothing more to be done.

00:34.880 --> 00:36.551
"Start planning the funeral."

00:36.640 --> 00:39.756
I loved my little sister
more than anything in the world.

00:39.840 --> 00:43.229
And I stood by her death bed,
took her hand.

00:44.439 --> 00:46.634
And I prayed.

00:46.719 --> 00:48.676
Asked God to heal her.

00:49.799 --> 00:53.395
I felt a warmth move through my body.

00:53.479 --> 00:57.552
It was God,
bestowing his gift of healing upon me.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.551
And here she is today!

00:59.640 --> 01:03.349
My little sister, Jane, alive and well!

01:05.680 --> 01:07.033
Hallelujah!

01:07.120 --> 01:10.031
From that moment on,
I knew God had chosen me

01:10.120 --> 01:12.075
to be his vessel here on earth.

01:12.159 --> 01:15.754
And today, I'm here
to share my gift with all of you.

01:16.439 --> 01:20.069
I'm told this poor young woman is suffering
from a heart condition.

01:20.159 --> 01:22.593
She's in pain every day of her life.

01:23.960 --> 01:26.234
Do you have faith the Lord can heal you today,

01:26.319 --> 01:28.959
- free you from your pain?
- I do.

01:29.039 --> 01:32.668
Then, Lord, I ask you to bless this woman,

01:32.759 --> 01:34.512
free her from her suffering!

01:34.599 --> 01:37.831
In God's holy name,
I demand you demons of sickness

01:37.920 --> 01:39.831
to leave this woman now!

01:41.000 --> 01:47.074

01:48.920 --> 01:50.956
My pain... It's gone!

01:51.039 --> 01:52.950
Hallelujah!

01:53.039 --> 01:54.996
Praise the Lord!

01:56.039 --> 01:59.076
- What a load of rubbish!
- Frank, you promised.

01:59.159 --> 02:02.197
- I'll wager she isn't even sick. She's an actress!
- Stop!

02:02.280 --> 02:05.192
Sir, if you do not wish to be here,
I suggest you leave.

02:05.920 --> 02:07.512
Don't do this, I'm begging you.

02:07.599 --> 02:10.396
You can't take away people's pain.
You're a fraud!

02:11.360 --> 02:13.634
If you disparage me, you disparage God.

02:14.599 --> 02:17.671
God's as big a fraud as you.

02:20.599 --> 02:22.875
He will punish you for your lack of faith.

02:25.599 --> 02:27.795
This man has been blind since birth.

02:27.879 --> 02:30.552
Never gazed into his wife's eyes,

02:30.639 --> 02:33.473
never seen the faces of
his beautiful children...

02:33.560 --> 02:36.233
Are you all right? Fred?

02:36.319 --> 02:37.957
Fred?

02:40.920 --> 02:42.876
Oh, God! Oh, God!

02:42.960 --> 02:45.155
Help me! Help me!

02:45.240 --> 02:47.116
Please help me!

02:49.079 --> 02:50.831
Please, help! Help!

02:50.920 --> 02:53.912
Please! Help me, please! Please!

03:01.599 --> 03:04.876
I suppose it's too late to decline
their dinner invitation.

03:04.960 --> 03:09.908
You're a brilliant wordsmith. No doubt you can
conjure up a few hours of polite conversation.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.955
Allow me.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.353
Arthur!

03:19.759 --> 03:21.716
I see what you're doing.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.756
- Do you?
- It's not going to work.

03:23.840 --> 03:25.318
Shame.

03:44.960 --> 03:47.872
There. That should get you through dinner.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
<font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font>

04:22.639 --> 04:24.596
Don't pack those away.

04:26.879 --> 04:28.677
She's going to come home.

04:42.199 --> 04:43.997
Here's a headline for you.

04:44.079 --> 04:46.548
People who go to faith
healers are already sick.

04:46.639 --> 04:48.437
This fellow Batch just happened to die

04:48.519 --> 04:51.079
moments after the Reverend Elias Downey
condemned him?

04:56.159 --> 04:59.151
- That was a gift from my wife.
- You're in the soup now.

05:00.360 --> 05:02.156
Uh! Ooh, what's this?

05:02.240 --> 05:05.276
You're suggesting they're performing tricks
just like you?

05:05.360 --> 05:06.997
Mine don't endanger people's lives.

05:07.079 --> 05:09.468
Guys like Downey promote quackery
over medicine.

05:09.560 --> 05:12.677
Someone comes to them with a treatable
condition like French gout.

05:12.759 --> 05:16.309
They offer prayer instead of sending them
to the doctor for mercury.

05:16.399 --> 05:19.675
- The sooner we stop Downey, the better.
- I have to agree with Harry.

05:19.759 --> 05:20.908
Beautiful <i>and</i> smart.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.514
You're a Catholic,
but don't believe in the hand of God?

05:23.600 --> 05:26.273
I do, but I don't believe
just anyone can channel it.

05:26.360 --> 05:29.511
According to this paper,
this man has performed countless miracles.

05:29.600 --> 05:32.159
He's cured cancer,
gave a blind man back his sight.

05:32.240 --> 05:36.312
Has he ever regrown a lost limb?
Something you can actually witness?

05:36.399 --> 05:39.516
I know a lot of faith healers are charlatans,
but he seems different.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.670
He doesn't even charge for admission.

05:41.759 --> 05:43.716
I bet he accepts donations, though.

05:43.800 --> 05:47.031
If we can prove he can actually heal people,

05:47.120 --> 05:50.192
imagine the possibilities,
the lives that can be saved.

05:54.159 --> 05:57.629
You want to save lives?
Let's prove that Downey's a fraud.

05:57.720 --> 06:01.076
First we need to determine
if Batch did die of natural causes.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.798
Right. We should do an autopsy.

06:02.879 --> 06:08.079
As far as I can recall, I'm still in charge.
And I will not authorise an autopsy

06:08.160 --> 06:11.072
without strong evidence
that a crime was actually committed.

06:11.560 --> 06:14.074
Batch was a sick man who died.

06:14.160 --> 06:16.798
That's an end to it.
Now, if you'll excuse me...

06:19.519 --> 06:21.875
You heard him say
we should investigate this, right?

06:21.959 --> 06:24.154
- Without a doubt.
- I know just where to start.

06:25.319 --> 06:27.276
Fred <i>did</i> have a mild case of the flu.

06:28.279 --> 06:30.350
But that's not why we went to the show.

06:33.439 --> 06:34.872
Mrs Batch?

06:37.000 --> 06:40.435
If I'm being honest,
I wasn't sure which one of us had a problem.

06:42.840 --> 06:44.273
You wanted a child?

06:44.360 --> 06:47.158
It was difficult because Fred
travelled so much for business.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.276
But after trying for three years,
I knew something was wrong.

06:50.360 --> 06:52.316
Reverend Downey was our last hope.

06:52.399 --> 06:55.153
Clearly your husband
didn't share your beliefs.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.591
He went to the show to appease me.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.716
But he just couldn't keep his mouth shut.

06:59.800 --> 07:03.428
- You're saying he brought this on himself?
- He evoked the wrath of God.

07:03.519 --> 07:05.475
The sooner we bury him, the better.

07:05.560 --> 07:07.516
Mrs Batch?

07:08.399 --> 07:10.355
I wanted to offer my condolences.

07:10.439 --> 07:12.396
Thank you so much.
That's very kind.

07:13.720 --> 07:16.153
I just hope you can find it in your heart
to forgive me.

07:16.240 --> 07:20.074
There's nothing to forgive.
The Lord knows the strength of your faith.

07:20.160 --> 07:22.468
And for that, you'll be rewarded.

07:22.560 --> 07:24.278
Amen to that.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.315
Harry Houdini!

07:26.399 --> 07:29.596
- What an honour. Elias Downey.
- Yes, I know, I've seen your work.

07:29.680 --> 07:32.557
Nice suit. Conning the sick and desperate
must pay well.

07:34.240 --> 07:37.356
It's unwise to insult a servant of God.

07:37.439 --> 07:39.396
Especially in a church.

07:40.680 --> 07:42.271
Is that a threat?

07:42.360 --> 07:45.557
Everyone, come on, gather near and watch,

07:45.639 --> 07:50.350
as Reverend Downey strikes me down
before your very eyes.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.072
What's it gonna be, Downey?
Are you gonna turn me to stone?

07:55.159 --> 07:58.596
Are you gonna summon a horde of wild animals
to tear me limb from limb?

07:58.680 --> 08:02.149
Or perhaps a good old-fashioned lightning bolt?
Ooh!

08:02.759 --> 08:04.750
It promises to be something really dramatic.

08:04.839 --> 08:07.115
- God decides who's punished.
- Don't be so modest.

08:08.360 --> 08:09.918
This looks like a tan line.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.151
Judging by the skin tones,
I'd say around a month old.

08:13.240 --> 08:14.958
He didn't get that tan in London.

08:15.040 --> 08:18.827
Who doesn't love seeing the wrath of God
up close and personal?

08:18.920 --> 08:20.273
I know I do.

08:20.360 --> 08:22.350
You too, sir, huh? I see it.

08:22.439 --> 08:24.396
I see it. Am I right?

08:24.480 --> 08:25.629
A rash.

08:25.720 --> 08:29.029
His wife said he travelled for work.
Must have been somewhere tropical.

08:29.120 --> 08:31.076
I don't think he had the flu.

08:31.160 --> 08:33.115
It might have been dengue fever.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.155
If left untreated, it can be fatal.

08:36.679 --> 08:38.635
Maybe he did die of natural causes.

08:40.200 --> 08:43.431
Isn't it odd that Mrs Batch didn't mention
her husband's rash?

08:44.480 --> 08:47.950
He might have downplayed his illness,
didn't want her to worry.

08:48.039 --> 08:51.588
I'll ask around at his work.
Maybe others were infected as well.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.989
If God really gave a damn,
there'd be no illness.

08:57.080 --> 08:59.957
- We cannot begin to understand his plan.
- Or maybe...

09:00.039 --> 09:04.397
God is just a louse who gets a divine thrill
out of watching people suffer.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.751
Still no lightning bolt?

09:07.840 --> 09:12.118
I'm sure it's coming.
He must just be busy with other blasphemers.

09:13.639 --> 09:15.710
God knows what is truly in your heart.

09:20.399 --> 09:22.355
Again, my deepest condolences.

09:28.639 --> 09:30.551
I'm still waiting to hear from Batch's boss

09:30.639 --> 09:33.312
to see if he was suffering other symptoms
of dengue fever.

09:33.399 --> 09:36.836
But... he wasn't the first non-believer
to have been struck down.

09:36.919 --> 09:40.798
A man in Liverpool burned to death,
a woman in Bristol was electrocuted,

09:40.879 --> 09:43.633
a man in Manchester was trampled
by a horse and carriage.

09:43.720 --> 09:45.836
They were all determined to be accidents.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.354
But they all died
hours after they disparaged Downey.

09:48.440 --> 09:49.952
These can't be coincidences.

09:50.039 --> 09:53.076
It does seem that heresy led to their demise.

09:53.159 --> 09:56.596
If anything, the timing of these accidents
suggests foul play.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.909
With the good Reverend as the main suspect.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.548
Wild speculation.
I'd say you had a grudge against the man.

10:02.639 --> 10:06.792
I know his kind. We've gotta shut this
guy down before more people are killed.

10:13.440 --> 10:15.509
He draws a bigger crowd than you.

10:15.600 --> 10:19.798
I don't use the fear of God to fill seats.

10:29.840 --> 10:31.477
You're Harry Houdini, ain't you?

10:31.559 --> 10:33.551
By your tone, I gather you're not a fan.

10:33.639 --> 10:37.633
Don't think it's a good idea for you to be here,
after what happened to the last doubter.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.995
It's all right, Joseph.
All of God's children are welcome.

10:42.679 --> 10:45.716
Thank you. He's very devoted to my brother.
We all are.

10:46.399 --> 10:48.355
I'm alive today because of him.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.395
His abilities are real.

10:50.480 --> 10:54.028
Now that you're here... Excuse me.
...you can see for yourself.

10:54.120 --> 10:58.317
All things are possible
for him that believeth.

10:59.240 --> 11:03.791
All things are possible for him that believeth.
Say it with me.

11:03.879 --> 11:07.873
All things are
possible for him that believeth.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.918
See, he's putting them in a suggestive state.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.470
There's a lot of techniques these guys use,
starting with the placebo effect.

11:15.399 --> 11:18.836
Charlatans have been using it for years.
Science has finally put a name on it.

11:18.919 --> 11:20.990
If you believe you'll feel better, you will.

11:21.080 --> 11:24.277
This tent is full of people
who want to believe in miracles.

11:24.360 --> 11:26.509
Nothing wrong with that.

11:29.080 --> 11:31.036
- Are you all right?
- My stomach.

11:34.279 --> 11:35.633
Hey.

11:37.039 --> 11:38.758
What are you doing?

11:41.519 --> 11:43.475
He's bleeding.

11:50.519 --> 11:52.272
What is that?

11:52.360 --> 11:54.236
The source of your pain - a tumour.

11:57.679 --> 11:58.953
But...

12:00.759 --> 12:03.479
You healed me. God bless you!

12:06.679 --> 12:09.591
That tumour looks suspiciously like
a chicken gizzard.

12:09.679 --> 12:12.240
Sleight of hand - another faith healer trick.

12:12.320 --> 12:14.595
And when all else fails, they use plants.

12:15.879 --> 12:18.440
That woman on crutches, she lives near me.

12:18.519 --> 12:21.273
Unless she's been feigning for two years,
she's not a plant.

12:21.360 --> 12:23.395
Then I'm afraid she's not walking out of here.

12:23.480 --> 12:26.119
Deliver him, Lord, from his cough. Hallelujah.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.155
Praise the Lord!

12:30.960 --> 12:33.190
- My lungs are clear. It's gone!
- Hallelujah!

12:34.399 --> 12:36.118
Ooh, it's a miracle.

12:36.200 --> 12:38.155
Coughs are always fatal.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.111
Oh, very funny.

12:45.080 --> 12:47.036
Are you all right?

12:50.080 --> 12:52.274
It's food poisoning.

12:52.360 --> 12:54.316
I need to find a bathroom.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.556
Drop your crutches and walk!

13:01.480 --> 13:03.436
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

13:03.519 --> 13:06.192
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!

13:13.159 --> 13:16.436
Miss Downey, there's something
I'd like to discuss with your brother.

13:18.399 --> 13:21.995
Lord, Father, place your healing hand
upon this woman.

13:22.840 --> 13:25.479
Lend her your might, your strength, Good Lord.

13:26.559 --> 13:28.515
In Jesus Christ's name.

13:45.840 --> 13:48.399
You can't expect a miracle
if you don't have faith.

13:49.360 --> 13:52.591
- I do have faith.
- Then prove it.

14:23.600 --> 14:26.159
I know I'm not in a position
to ask for favours.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.993
Especially since I turned my back on the
Church.

14:29.080 --> 14:31.957
Nothing to do with you -
bloody fools in the Vatican.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.196
I hope...

14:36.279 --> 14:38.235
you won't hold it against me.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.556
Or that I killed Holmes.

14:43.240 --> 14:45.196
You probably prefer Dickens.

14:45.279 --> 14:47.235
I'm rather partial to him myself.

14:51.440 --> 14:53.270
I need your help.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.316
The children need their mother.

14:57.279 --> 14:59.235
They miss her.

15:03.159 --> 15:05.115
I miss her.

15:07.759 --> 15:09.716
So much.

15:11.759 --> 15:15.548
I can't go through the rest of my life
without hearing her voice...

15:17.639 --> 15:19.596
...her laughter.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.751
Please.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.317
Please.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.711
Arthur.

16:17.240 --> 16:19.196
You need a haircut.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.078
How long have I been?

16:28.679 --> 16:29.749
Six months.

16:30.559 --> 16:32.118
The children?

16:32.200 --> 16:34.110
They're fine.

16:34.200 --> 16:37.749
Although I have occasionally entertained
the notion of boarding school.

16:40.240 --> 16:41.878
I must look a fright.

16:44.159 --> 16:47.197
You're the most beautiful thing
that I have ever seen.

16:49.879 --> 16:53.190
Then you need a haircut <i>and</i> spectacles.

16:57.759 --> 17:00.149
<i>Her awakening is truly remarkable</i>.

17:00.240 --> 17:01.912
But we need to exercise caution.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.912
If she's to make a full recovery,
she'll need plenty of rest.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.468
- So, please, keep your visits brief.
- Of course.

17:08.559 --> 17:10.710
I got your message.
That's fantastic.

17:10.799 --> 17:12.471
Thank you.

17:12.559 --> 17:15.915
But you couldn't possibly believe
this has anything to do with Downey?

17:16.000 --> 17:18.877
He laid hands on her, and moments later,
she opened her eyes.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.598
- Diseases do go into remission.
- TB?

17:21.680 --> 17:23.432
There has to be a rational explanation.

17:23.519 --> 17:25.828
So far, her doctor has been unable
to provide one.

17:25.920 --> 17:29.355
Before you mention the placebo effect -
she was unconscious.

17:29.440 --> 17:31.476
If you're suggesting she was a plant,

17:31.559 --> 17:36.554
I suppose I have to admit that our 12 years of
marriage and two children could be a ruse.

17:36.640 --> 17:39.757
She could have faked her illness
to get away from your long speeches.

17:39.839 --> 17:41.875
I don't trust Downey.
He's a con artist.

17:41.960 --> 17:44.712
- And maybe a murderer.
- Then why heal my wife?

17:44.799 --> 17:46.836
He didn't! It's all part of his scam.

17:46.920 --> 17:49.991
You're famous - kind of.
Imagine the publicity.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.677
Believe whatever you want.

17:52.759 --> 17:55.876
But something happened here
that you can't explain.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.711
Something wonderful.

18:00.240 --> 18:04.392
I enquired at Batch's work.
He hadn't been anywhere tropical in months.

18:04.480 --> 18:06.038
You're looking a little peaky.

18:06.119 --> 18:08.474
You're not going to throw up again, are you?

18:08.559 --> 18:10.516
- You <i>do</i> care!
- Only about my shoes.

18:11.279 --> 18:13.748
Admit it, you enjoyed our dinner.

18:13.839 --> 18:15.432
We should do it again.

18:15.519 --> 18:17.589
Let's just focus on the investigation.

18:19.319 --> 18:21.196
Good idea.

18:21.279 --> 18:24.795
Right now, we have no medical explanation
for Batch's death.

18:24.880 --> 18:26.836
We need that autopsy.

18:29.559 --> 18:32.313
Merring was adamant
there'd be no autopsy.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.516
However did you get him to authorise this?

18:34.599 --> 18:38.479
Put forth a convincing argument.
I can do that, you know.

18:38.559 --> 18:42.189
And you thought it best to dig up the body
in the middle of the night?

18:42.279 --> 18:44.236
It is a matter of some urgency.

18:45.559 --> 18:49.997
- You didn't ask Merring's permission, did you?
- Ooh, bad girl! I like it.

18:50.079 --> 18:51.512
You could lose your job.

18:51.599 --> 18:53.989
Only if she gets caught -
which is quite likely.

18:54.079 --> 18:55.957
Not if Dr Doyle performs the autopsy.

18:56.799 --> 19:00.348
I've a friend at the coroner's office
who can grant us access in discretion.

19:00.440 --> 19:04.318
Even if we do find something,
that won't disprove Downey's abilities.

19:04.400 --> 19:07.073
- Look at my wife.
- Which is why I pulled her medical records.

19:07.160 --> 19:08.593
You did what?

19:08.680 --> 19:12.115
- Those are confidential.
- Most people can't say no to a celebrity.

19:12.200 --> 19:13.872
You had no right to go behind my back.

19:13.960 --> 19:18.112
Seems our buddy here forgot to mention
his wife was given an experimental treatment.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.588
Her lungs were injected with antiseptic.

19:20.680 --> 19:23.911
Several TB patients in France
were completely cured by it.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.116
That treatment was administered weeks ago
with no improvement.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.271
- Her doctor ruled it a failure.
- Then her doctor was wrong.

19:30.359 --> 19:33.352
Isn't it more likely
that the treatment took time to work,

19:33.440 --> 19:36.272
than some supernatural force
magically cured her?

19:36.359 --> 19:38.316
Are you all right?

19:39.400 --> 19:41.355
Yeah, my back.

19:41.440 --> 19:42.713
Here.

19:44.519 --> 19:46.476
- I'm fine!
- Let me look.

19:53.599 --> 19:55.556
You're covered in boils.

19:59.680 --> 20:03.115
Doctor, have you ever seen
a case of food poisoning like this?

20:03.200 --> 20:06.396
- It's not food poisoning.
- It's not the wrath of God either.

20:06.480 --> 20:09.596
I believe Mr Houdini is suffering from
Hidradenitis suppurativa.

20:10.880 --> 20:13.678
Clogged sweat glands.
It's the price of a great physique.

20:13.759 --> 20:15.875
Does it also cause vomiting?

20:17.079 --> 20:20.038
Not normally,
but there could be an underlying infection.

20:20.119 --> 20:23.395
I've drained the boils.
This poultice will help them heal.

20:23.960 --> 20:25.996
He'll be back to his old self in no time.

20:27.440 --> 20:29.192
Hey, that's a good thing.

20:32.640 --> 20:34.596
It's just the timing of it all.

20:35.960 --> 20:41.239
If a man is struck by a train, and a year later his
brother is struck by the same train, what is that?

20:41.319 --> 20:42.594
- Coincidence.
- Exactly.

20:42.680 --> 20:44.954
One coincidence I can accept, but this?

20:45.039 --> 20:47.917
You express lack of faith
and are struck with an affliction.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.115
Correlation does not equal causation.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.833
I've already explained
Mrs Doyle's miraculous recovery.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.637
Dr Kasad has explained my illness.

20:55.720 --> 20:58.279
And I'm sure the autopsy
will explain Mr Batch.

22:12.079 --> 22:13.307
Doyle!

22:15.880 --> 22:17.836
- Is he...
- Still alive.

22:18.519 --> 22:20.192
Come on, Sleeping Beauty, wake up!

22:22.279 --> 22:24.236
Shall I fetch some smelling salts?

22:24.319 --> 22:26.709
- No, I prefer this method.
- I'm awake! I'm awake!

22:26.799 --> 22:28.756
What happened?

22:30.319 --> 22:32.038
We need to get out of this room.

22:35.519 --> 22:37.476
You were right. Batch was murdered.

22:37.559 --> 22:39.516
I knew that, but how?

22:39.599 --> 22:40.919
Poisoned.

22:42.440 --> 22:44.395
It explains the rash on his chest.

22:45.400 --> 22:48.357
When I nicked his stomach,
a toxic gas was released.

22:48.440 --> 22:52.193
It happens when cyanide
reacts with gastric acid.

22:52.279 --> 22:54.748
- We need to get you to hospital.
- I'm all right.

22:54.839 --> 22:56.796
The cyanide was lethal for Mr Batch,

22:56.880 --> 23:01.351
but the gas it produced wasn't concentrated
enough to cause me any serious harm.

23:04.599 --> 23:06.750
We need to tell Merring.

23:06.839 --> 23:09.718
I specifically told you
there would be no autopsy.

23:09.799 --> 23:11.994
- This means dismissal.
- Chief Inspector...

23:12.079 --> 23:13.558
- Come on!
- You're right.

23:13.640 --> 23:17.872
You have every right to be angry at Stratton.
She should be dismissed, absolutely.

23:17.960 --> 23:20.917
And I'm sure you'll be able to come up with
an explanation

23:21.000 --> 23:25.596
as to how you uncovered a murder in a case
you didn't even want to investigate.

23:26.720 --> 23:30.155
You should issue an arrest warrant for
Elias Downey immediately.

23:30.240 --> 23:33.277
I said Batch was murdered,
I didn't say at the hands of Downey.

23:33.359 --> 23:35.555
Poisoning is a very human way of killing

23:35.640 --> 23:37.869
for someone with other-worldly abilities.

23:37.960 --> 23:39.393
Where is your evidence?

23:39.480 --> 23:42.278
Don't say Touie. She was healed by medicine,
not a miracle man.

23:42.359 --> 23:44.237
Why are you so intent on persecuting Downey?

23:44.319 --> 23:46.880
He's a killer!
Four hecklers are pushing up daisies!

23:46.960 --> 23:48.711
Am I the only one who sees a pattern here?

23:48.799 --> 23:51.439
The fire in Liverpool
was attributed to a stray cigarette.

23:51.519 --> 23:53.988
Electrocution in Bristol
was due to faulty wiring.

23:54.079 --> 23:56.469
And as for the man in Manchester...

23:57.440 --> 24:00.590
...witnesses said the horse got spooked.

24:01.599 --> 24:04.397
- No evidence of foul play.
- Doesn't mean there wasn't any.

24:04.480 --> 24:07.438
I hope you're not suggesting all
English police are incompetent?

24:07.519 --> 24:10.671
I hope you're not suggesting
every murder in England gets solved.

24:11.400 --> 24:14.278
As long as we can all agree
that this one was a murder.

24:14.359 --> 24:16.316
I've got a matinee to do.

24:19.240 --> 24:22.710
It appears the only thing we all agree on
is that Batch was murdered.

24:23.799 --> 24:25.756
If not by Downey, then who?

24:28.839 --> 24:32.037
In these cases,
the most obvious suspect is someone...

24:32.119 --> 24:34.076
a little closer to home.

24:34.799 --> 24:36.790
You said you had difficulty conceiving.

24:36.880 --> 24:39.519
Did that cause discord in your marriage?

24:39.599 --> 24:41.192
We'd had a few rows.

24:41.279 --> 24:43.236
I heard it was more than that.

24:43.319 --> 24:47.153
Your neighbours said they heard screaming
one night, glass breaking.

24:48.599 --> 24:51.272
Fred dropped a box of my mother's china.

24:51.359 --> 24:52.792
I got upset.

24:55.839 --> 24:58.354
You don't think I had something
to do with his death?

24:58.440 --> 25:01.636
You have a new gramophone.
Must have been expensive.

25:02.759 --> 25:05.957
You recently received a large sum
from your husband's life insurance.

25:06.039 --> 25:07.996
Â£2,000, was it?

25:09.440 --> 25:11.395
I did not kill my husband!

25:12.599 --> 25:15.432
That insurance policy
has been in place for years!

25:15.519 --> 25:18.671
- If you don't mind, I'm meeting some ladies.
- A few more questions.

25:18.759 --> 25:20.511
May I use your bathroom?

25:55.039 --> 25:56.519
Look at this.

25:57.440 --> 25:59.031
I could only make out a few words,

25:59.119 --> 26:01.269
but one of them is definitely "apple",

26:01.359 --> 26:04.396
the seeds of which
are the main ingredient in cyanide.

26:04.480 --> 26:07.232
She could have obtained a recipe
from an apothecary.

26:07.319 --> 26:08.958
This is definitely a recipe...

26:09.039 --> 26:10.871
for apple fritters.

26:12.240 --> 26:14.878
See, there's "flour". That looks like "eggs".

26:14.960 --> 26:16.790
Never been a fan of fritters.

26:16.880 --> 26:18.871
Still, I wouldn't rule her out as a suspect.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.996
The insurance money's an excellent motive.

26:21.079 --> 26:23.548
- How can you not like fritters?
- I prefer plum pudding.

26:23.640 --> 26:27.394
Mrs Batch also had opportunity
in the hours leading up to his death.

26:27.480 --> 26:30.836
If she was gonna poison him,
what better place to throw off suspicion?

26:30.920 --> 26:33.194
At the funeral, her behaviour seemed odd.

26:33.279 --> 26:36.032
She wasn't acting like someone
who'd just lost a spouse.

26:36.119 --> 26:38.429
Is there a proper way to
act in that situation?

26:38.519 --> 26:40.032
Devastated.

26:40.119 --> 26:42.713
Barely able to string a sentence together.

26:43.440 --> 26:46.477
Eyes red and puffy from tears
that never stop falling.

26:47.079 --> 26:50.628
Walking round in a fog because
everything you ever knew and loved is gone.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.355
My mother loved my father desperately.

26:55.440 --> 26:57.395
When he died, she never recovered.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.837
I'm sorry.

27:01.359 --> 27:04.510
I also found something else suspicious
in Mrs Batch's bedroom.

27:05.240 --> 27:06.593
The Rosewood?

27:06.680 --> 27:09.512
Why would Mrs Batch have a pencil
from a local hotel,

27:09.599 --> 27:11.556
when she lives here?

27:47.799 --> 27:49.756
Lift him out now!

27:50.599 --> 27:52.556
He's going to die!

27:55.079 --> 27:56.398
Out!

27:57.359 --> 27:59.112
Out now!

28:04.119 --> 28:05.394
Raise the curtain.

28:33.519 --> 28:35.476
- Mummy!
- Oh, my darlings!

28:36.200 --> 28:38.155
I knew you'd wake up.

28:38.240 --> 28:40.195
Let me take a look at you.

28:40.960 --> 28:42.790
My, how you've grown!

28:42.880 --> 28:45.314
Three-quarters of an inch since last month.

28:45.400 --> 28:47.117
He's eating us out of house and home.

28:47.200 --> 28:49.155
Oh, you've done a wonderful job.

28:49.240 --> 28:51.878
Let's just say
we haven't had any major disasters.

28:51.960 --> 28:54.598
- Though you almost burnt the house down.
- Kingsley!

28:54.680 --> 28:56.159
- A fire?
- Small one.

28:56.240 --> 28:59.949
Vera was ill, Father tried to fry lamb chops,
caught the curtains on fire.

29:00.039 --> 29:03.316
The fire brigade showed up.
There was water everywhere.

29:03.400 --> 29:04.515
Just the kitchen.

29:05.519 --> 29:08.272
Well, I never did like those curtains anyway.

29:12.759 --> 29:16.195
We'll have to keep this visit short.
Mustn't overtax your mother.

29:16.279 --> 29:18.236
- Just a little longer.
- Please, Father.

29:18.319 --> 29:21.868
Let them stay. Just the sight of their faces
makes me feel better.

29:25.200 --> 29:27.430
Right, I want to hear everything I've missed.

29:27.519 --> 29:29.476
Don't leave out a single detail.

29:29.559 --> 29:31.516
I made a new friend at school.

29:32.079 --> 29:34.115
Her name's Paloma, she's from Spain.

29:34.200 --> 29:37.237
Guess what?
Paloma's brother sits next to me in class!

29:37.319 --> 29:38.594
No?

29:42.759 --> 29:45.273
- What the hell?
- Thank goodness.

29:45.359 --> 29:46.679
Hey.

29:46.759 --> 29:48.715
OK, I get it.

29:50.680 --> 29:52.032
What am I doing here?

29:52.119 --> 29:55.714
Your fever was so high, it caused a seizure
in the middle of your performance.

29:55.799 --> 29:58.872
Quite the spectacle, I heard.
Florrie saved your life.

29:58.960 --> 30:01.473
- Love that girl.
- I thought you fancied Miss Stratton?

30:01.559 --> 30:03.278
Can't figure that one out.

30:03.359 --> 30:06.238
Are you gonna have dinner with her again,
the good constable?

30:06.319 --> 30:07.719
Maybe.

30:07.799 --> 30:09.199
Turn you down, did she?

30:09.279 --> 30:11.669
I don't understand.
I was a complete gentleman.

30:11.759 --> 30:13.796
I thought we had a good time.

30:13.880 --> 30:16.109
Maybe she prefers the company of women.

30:19.279 --> 30:21.588
Almost every one of these bones
has been broken.

30:22.680 --> 30:24.635
Most weren't even set properly.

30:24.720 --> 30:26.675
Well, I can't do my show in a cast.

30:27.519 --> 30:30.239
You must be in agony every single day.

30:30.319 --> 30:32.276
High pain tolerance.

30:32.359 --> 30:34.874
Your temperature is still
dangerously elevated.

30:34.960 --> 30:37.348
Dr Kasad's treatment clearly isn't working.

30:37.440 --> 30:39.395
Then let's try something else.

30:39.480 --> 30:42.711
You can't treat a condition
unless you know what it is.

30:45.920 --> 30:49.548
I think you should consider
paying a visit to Downey.

30:49.640 --> 30:52.393
I let myself believe and got my wife back.

30:52.480 --> 30:53.753
You're a doctor!

30:53.839 --> 30:57.388
Why would you rather believe
that she was cured by God than medicine?

30:58.240 --> 31:01.117
Do you think that your lack of faith
somehow caused her illness?

31:01.200 --> 31:03.588
Is this your way of regaining
some sense of control?

31:03.680 --> 31:06.751
Control? You won't believe in anything
without tangible evidence.

31:06.839 --> 31:09.990
God was invented to explain things
that we don't understand.

31:10.079 --> 31:12.036
Now we have science.

31:12.119 --> 31:15.430
If I beat this illness, it'll be thanks
to medicine and my constitution.

31:15.519 --> 31:18.353
That may not be enough.
If your fever continues to climb,

31:18.440 --> 31:20.509
your brain will shut down and you will die.

31:21.960 --> 31:23.915
You should be in bed.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.592
I'll hop back in if you'll join me.

31:25.680 --> 31:27.477
That pencil from the Rosewood Hotel.

31:27.559 --> 31:30.836
Mrs Batch was there the night before
her husband was murdered.

31:30.920 --> 31:32.830
Guess who she was visiting.

31:41.880 --> 31:43.836
Mr Houdini. You look quite ill.

31:43.920 --> 31:45.875
Have you come to be healed?

31:45.960 --> 31:48.190
You're not a healer, you're a murderer.

31:48.279 --> 31:51.635
We discovered cyanide
in Mr Batch's stomach contents.

31:51.720 --> 31:53.631
I didn't poison anyone.

31:53.720 --> 31:56.677
Mrs Batch saw you the night before
her husband was murdered.

31:56.759 --> 31:59.228
- Were the two of you having an affair?
- Of course not!

31:59.319 --> 32:02.949
You hatched a plan to get rid of her husband
so you two could be together.

32:04.720 --> 32:06.675
Mrs Batch did come to see me...

32:06.759 --> 32:08.715
to ask for prayer

32:08.799 --> 32:11.597
and to warn me her husband might cause a stir
at the service.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.557
Did you in turn warn her
of possible repercussions?

32:14.640 --> 32:17.313
I did. She said she'd do her best
to make sure he behaved.

32:17.400 --> 32:21.028
If you knew Batch would be there,
you had time to purchase cyanide.

32:22.119 --> 32:25.237
I've been blessed with the ability
to channel the power of God.

32:25.319 --> 32:28.630
Even if I did want to cause someone harm,
why would I resort to poison?

32:28.720 --> 32:31.075
Doyle here might find that
a compelling argument.

32:31.160 --> 32:33.115
For the rest of us, a little test.

32:33.200 --> 32:35.155
I have here a vial of cyanide.

32:35.240 --> 32:36.798
If you're as powerful as you say,

32:36.880 --> 32:39.314
you'll be able to drink this
and nothing will happen.

32:39.400 --> 32:41.834
- Have you lost your mind?
- Harry, please.

32:41.920 --> 32:43.955
He's a vessel of God, he'll be fine.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.672
Because he won't drink it.

32:55.440 --> 32:56.873
We need to induce vomiting.

32:56.960 --> 32:58.313
That won't be necessary.

33:00.160 --> 33:01.912
I'm perfectly fine.

33:13.960 --> 33:16.190
You didn't really give him cyanide, did you?

33:16.279 --> 33:17.837
Because he's still alive?

33:17.920 --> 33:20.832
When Downey reached for the cyanide,
you didn't try to stop him.

33:20.920 --> 33:23.718
- You're an illusionist, not a murderer.
- What was the point?

33:23.799 --> 33:26.029
- A test.
- Which he passed with flying colours.

33:26.119 --> 33:28.713
Just cos he drank it,
it doesn't prove he's the real deal.

33:28.799 --> 33:31.439
It just proves that he's crazy enough
to think that he is.

33:31.519 --> 33:34.159
But it does mean he wouldn't use poison
to kill someone.

33:34.240 --> 33:37.471
- Rules him out as a suspect.
- In other words, you were wrong.

33:39.240 --> 33:41.195
Mrs Batch is still a suspect.

33:41.279 --> 33:44.670
If we establish where the cyanide came from,
maybe we can tie it to her.

33:44.759 --> 33:48.230
Some pharmacies stock it.
It's used topically to treat wounds.

33:48.319 --> 33:50.674
You have to request it from the pharmacist
directly.

33:50.759 --> 33:54.991
I'll request the records of every pharmacy in
town, to verify who purchased cyanide recently.

34:01.200 --> 34:03.155
What have you got?

34:03.839 --> 34:07.548
Two runs of four and a pair for ten.

34:07.640 --> 34:11.632
You missed 15-2, 15-4.
Those points are mine.

34:11.719 --> 34:13.675
Which means I win!

34:14.559 --> 34:16.391
Pinochle's more my game.

34:16.480 --> 34:19.552
Darling, you're good at many things,
but cards isn't one of them.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.956
I've missed this.

34:23.039 --> 34:24.996
Losing to me at cards?

34:25.079 --> 34:26.398
Yes.

34:31.280 --> 34:35.318
Let's sneak out of here, have dinner,
walk along the Thames.

34:35.400 --> 34:36.719
Plotting your escape?

34:37.960 --> 34:40.474
Just an excursion.
I'm feeling much better.

34:40.559 --> 34:42.516
Let's have a listen.

34:45.159 --> 34:47.195
Your lungs are showing improvement.

34:48.400 --> 34:50.436
But you still have a long road ahead of you.

34:50.518 --> 34:53.398
I think it's best you remain under our care.
Get some rest.

34:53.480 --> 34:55.436
I'll look in on you tomorrow.

35:04.360 --> 35:07.909
Why don't we have dinner tomorrow night, here,
just the two of us?

35:08.000 --> 35:09.956
Chateaubriand, roast potatoes.

35:11.320 --> 35:14.197
- You're not going to try and cook again?
- I'll ask Vera.

35:15.679 --> 35:17.750
If we're going to have a proper dinner,

35:17.840 --> 35:19.795
I'd like to dress the part.

35:19.880 --> 35:25.079
I don't know. I reckon you'd set a fashion
trend wearing that hospital frock.

35:25.159 --> 35:28.630
I was thinking more of my black evening dress.
The one with the lace trim.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.195
Or the grey silk if you'd prefer.

35:39.199 --> 35:40.552
What is it?

35:43.519 --> 35:45.476
I gave up on you.

35:49.079 --> 35:52.436
It was precisely your faith
that brought me back.

35:54.199 --> 35:56.235
You've nothing to feel guilty about.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.356
Unless you've taken up with Vera.

36:02.639 --> 36:04.596
I do like her plum pudding.

36:47.360 --> 36:49.554
Harry, get back in bed.

36:59.519 --> 37:02.273
I've got to tell you, Ma, I don't feel so hot.

37:02.960 --> 37:04.597
Rest.

37:04.679 --> 37:07.353
And my chicken soup.

37:07.440 --> 37:09.590
That will make you better.

37:17.239 --> 37:18.719
Thanks.

37:23.639 --> 37:25.596
You're not going to leave me.

37:26.519 --> 37:27.998
Understand?

37:29.840 --> 37:31.795
You're the great Houdini.

37:32.800 --> 37:34.755
You can escape everything.

37:36.159 --> 37:37.717
Don't...

37:46.880 --> 37:48.472
I'm gonna be OK, Ma.

37:49.159 --> 37:51.115
I promise.

38:02.079 --> 38:04.833
This pharmacy was robbed
the night before Batch was killed.

38:04.920 --> 38:06.717
Let me guess, they took cyanide?

38:06.800 --> 38:09.074
It's round the corner from Downey's hotel.

38:09.159 --> 38:12.072
Police collected fragmentary evidence
from the scene.

38:12.159 --> 38:15.835
You sound surprised. Some constables
embrace Sherlock Holmes's methods.

38:15.920 --> 38:17.432
The majority renounce them.

38:17.519 --> 38:20.751
"A dark hair was recovered
from the broken window, 18 inches long."

38:20.840 --> 38:23.400
Our thief was a woman,
but Mrs Batch is blonde.

38:23.480 --> 38:25.436
"One other item was stolen.

38:26.320 --> 38:28.275
A box of Goa powder."

38:29.159 --> 38:32.630
- Meaning?
- I know who the killer is.

38:33.360 --> 38:35.920
I am not the only dark-haired woman in London.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.275
But you're one of the few with psoriasis -

38:38.360 --> 38:41.318
- a condition treated with Goa powder.
- I don't have psoriasis.

38:41.400 --> 38:43.960
This is a misunderstanding.
You have the wrong person.

38:44.039 --> 38:46.713
Your nails are cracked and brittle,
a classic symptom.

38:46.800 --> 38:48.597
From washing dishes after every show.

38:48.679 --> 38:50.715
I doubt you've ever touched a bar of lye.

38:50.800 --> 38:52.755
The day we saw the show was quite hot,

38:52.840 --> 38:55.273
and yet you were wearing a scarf
just as you are now.

38:55.360 --> 38:56.998
My sister is a woman of modesty.

38:57.079 --> 38:59.992
- Prove us wrong. Remove your scarf.
- This is madness!

39:00.079 --> 39:02.753
It's all right, Jane.
Show them you have nothing to hide.

39:03.719 --> 39:06.836
If I had psoriasis,
why wouldn't I ask my brother to heal me?

39:08.000 --> 39:10.230
Because you know he has no healing powers.

39:10.320 --> 39:13.755
That's not true. When I was a child,
he brought me back from the brink of death.

39:13.840 --> 39:16.478
In all likelihood,
your pneumonia got better on its own.

39:16.559 --> 39:18.152
The timing was just coincidence.

39:18.239 --> 39:20.708
You saw I drank cyanide and nothing happened.

39:20.800 --> 39:22.755
It was water - a test.

39:24.119 --> 39:25.757
I've cured hundreds of people,

39:25.840 --> 39:28.559
restored their sight, made them walk,
took away their pain.

39:28.639 --> 39:30.119
Because they believed.

39:30.199 --> 39:33.476
As for those who didn't,
your sister made an example of them.

39:33.559 --> 39:35.072
Like Frederick Batch.

39:35.159 --> 39:37.913
His wife warned you
he might make a scene at the show.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.797
So Jane offered him a refreshment...

39:40.880 --> 39:42.996
one laced with cyanide.

39:43.079 --> 39:45.309
What better way to make people believe

39:45.400 --> 39:47.789
than by showing them
what happens to those who don't?

39:52.559 --> 39:55.313
- Do you know what you're saying?
- Your sister is a murderer.

39:55.400 --> 39:57.550
That's a lie. You've got to believe me.

40:01.559 --> 40:02.913
Remove your scarf.

40:04.760 --> 40:07.034
Are you going to take their word over mine?

40:13.920 --> 40:15.637
- Elias!
- Put the gun down.

40:15.719 --> 40:19.394
If I truly have powers like you say I do,
I can heal you.

40:20.360 --> 40:22.271
That's not the way to prove it.

40:24.880 --> 40:26.393
Please.

40:29.639 --> 40:31.596
You'll kill me.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.956
- It's all been a lie.
- No.

40:45.039 --> 40:49.032
You helped so many people
because we made them believe in you.

40:50.400 --> 40:53.119
But this is... You kept saying I had a gift.

40:53.199 --> 40:57.112
You do. It was your faith...
that gave people hope.

40:58.039 --> 41:01.349
Your faith made them better.
They really got better.

41:01.440 --> 41:03.748
Mr Batch and all the others?

41:03.840 --> 41:05.956
They gave their lives so others could believe.

41:06.039 --> 41:09.918
As long as people had faith in your
divine powers, they could be healed.

41:10.719 --> 41:12.710
There's no higher calling than that.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.869
Their blood is on our hands.

41:14.960 --> 41:16.757
No need to spill any more.

41:18.320 --> 41:21.596
If you shoot her, you're
no better than she is.

41:36.639 --> 41:39.871
Jane Downey, you're under arrest
on the charge of murder.

41:45.199 --> 41:47.155
Are you all right?

41:47.239 --> 41:49.070
Houdini!

41:57.079 --> 41:59.547
Every time I open my eyes,
I've gotta see your face?

41:59.639 --> 42:03.188
- Good afternoon to you too.
- Doctor says your fever has broken.

42:03.280 --> 42:04.918
And the boils are gone.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.036
Downey loses his faith
and you have a miraculous recovery.

42:08.119 --> 42:11.192
Maybe, subconsciously,
you did believe in his powers.

42:11.280 --> 42:14.192
It was my mother.
Her chicken soup can cure anything.

42:14.280 --> 42:17.317
What's more interesting
is why you showed up at that tent.

42:17.400 --> 42:21.438
You didn't know Adelaide and I would be there,
leaving me with only one conclusion.

42:21.519 --> 42:23.750
You went there to ask Downey to heal you.

42:24.599 --> 42:26.715
I lost my cufflink at a show.

42:27.519 --> 42:29.750
It cost more than most people make in a year.

42:29.840 --> 42:31.670
I'm sure it'll turn up.

42:46.400 --> 42:50.074
Nurse, start again and draw some blood.
We need a full test.

42:50.159 --> 42:51.559
Doctor?

42:52.840 --> 42:55.273
She slipped back into unconsciousness.

42:55.360 --> 42:58.829
I can't explain it. I'm sorry.

43:50.500 --> 43:58.500
