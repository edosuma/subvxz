03:34.748 --> 03:35.747
...Here!

03:35.749 --> 03:37.316
It is?

03:37.318 --> 03:40.886
Applesauce of the apple family
lineage is a fourth cousin

03:40.888 --> 03:43.288
Twice removed of the pie family.

03:43.290 --> 03:45.824
I see the part about our great,

03:45.826 --> 03:47.893

twice removed part,

03:47.895 --> 03:50.395
But that last bit's
awful smudged.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.898
Are you sure it says "pie"?

03:52.900 --> 03:55.300
I guess it is a
little smudged.

03:55.302 --> 03:56.802
But I see most of it there,

03:56.804 --> 03:59.738

in my heart it was true.

04:00.840 --> 04:04.576

the sweetest thing.

04:04.578 --> 04:05.944

04:05.946 --> 04:07.980
I'd just hate for us
to get all excited

04:07.982 --> 04:09.781
Before we found
out for sure.

04:09.783 --> 04:12.651
So how are we supposed
to find out for sure?

04:14.921 --> 04:17.522
Cousin goldie delicious!

04:17.524 --> 04:20.993
Her cabin's practically an
apple family history museum.

04:20.995 --> 04:23.895
If anypony has the records
to back up pinkie's theory,

04:23.897 --> 04:25.697
It's her!

04:25.699 --> 04:27.399
I suppose we could always...

04:27.401 --> 04:30.335
I mean goldie delicious doesn't
live all that far away...

04:30.337 --> 04:33.639
<i>And we haven't been on one as</i>
<i>a family in a real long time...</i>

04:36.643 --> 04:38.710
Are y'all thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?

04:40.013 --> 04:41.980
Family road trip!

04:45.952 --> 04:48.787
Has anypony seen my
travelin' bonnet?

04:48.789 --> 04:50.455
Isn't that it on your head?

04:50.457 --> 04:52.858
No.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.593
It looks an
awful lot like--

04:54.595 --> 04:55.594
Well, it's ain't.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.029
And that's final.

04:57.031 --> 05:01.066
Since pinkie pie is back home
gettin' her stuff for the trip,

05:01.068 --> 05:04.369
I just wanted to say
something real quick.

05:04.371 --> 05:07.839
I've had somethin' in my teeth
this whole time, haven't I?

05:07.841 --> 05:10.909
Gadsnickety, what a way to
welcome a family member!

05:10.911 --> 05:14.446
Uh, no, granny, your
teeth are fine.

05:14.448 --> 05:17.316
I just wanted to be sure that
we're all on the same page

05:17.318 --> 05:20.986
About showin' pinkie pie how
awesome a family we really are.

05:20.988 --> 05:23.955
We want her to get to know the
family she's been born into!

05:23.957 --> 05:27.359
But like, the best
version of it, you know?

05:27.361 --> 05:30.028
Oh! Don't you worry, honey!

05:30.030 --> 05:33.732
We're a great family and
she can't help but see it.

05:33.734 --> 05:36.468
I bet my future cutie mark's
gonna be a picture of me

05:36.470 --> 05:38.503

09:08.881 --> 09:10.649
Well, back in the old days

09:10.651 --> 09:12.984
We used to use the sap
from a sugar pine tree

09:14.721 --> 09:17.022
