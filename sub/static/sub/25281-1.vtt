00:07.192 --> 00:08.902
Hey, hi.

00:08.943 --> 00:10.112
Mr. McBride.

00:10.154 --> 00:11.155
Right?

00:11.196 --> 00:13.123
Are you by chance Billy McBride?

00:13.165 --> 00:15.784
- Huh? The Billy McBride.
- Goddamn it.

00:15.826 --> 00:17.578
I got a civil case.

00:17.619 --> 00:19.764
A friend of mine, her brother
worked for Borns Technology

00:19.806 --> 00:21.113
and he died on one of their boats.

00:21.117 --> 00:23.963
Your old firm's big kahuna client,

00:24.043 --> 00:26.378
they told her that her brother
killed himself,

00:26.420 --> 00:27.773
but she's convinced he didn't.

00:27.815 --> 00:29.673
Okay. Come on. Here.

00:29.715 --> 00:31.309
I Googled you, you know.

00:31.351 --> 00:33.969
Did Google happen
to say what became of me?

00:34.011 --> 00:35.304
You drink too much.

00:35.345 --> 00:37.104
That's not accurate.

00:38.515 --> 00:40.684
I drink just the right amount.

00:40.726 --> 00:42.596
He was already drunk.

00:42.637 --> 00:44.688
And this isn't me just ripping on my ex.

00:44.730 --> 00:47.900
This was one of the best
trial lawyers ever.

00:47.941 --> 00:49.068
Juries used to love you.

00:49.109 --> 00:51.111
At one point, they loved me so much,

00:51.153 --> 00:54.329
I could do anything I wanted, just about.

00:54.865 --> 00:56.492
But that can be dangerous.

00:56.533 --> 00:59.466
The idea of you and
my fucked up sister-in-law

00:59.508 --> 01:01.943
tearing open wounds to chase
some big pot of gold...

01:01.985 --> 01:04.333
I'm chasing the truth, Ms.
Larson. That's all I'm doing.

01:04.373 --> 01:06.126
- Bullshit.
- Aren't you interested in the truth?

01:06.168 --> 01:08.337
A Gina Larson called.

01:08.378 --> 01:10.631
Billy McBride visited her.

01:10.672 --> 01:12.633
I went and saw the dead guy's wife.

01:12.674 --> 01:13.926
She's hiding something.

01:13.967 --> 01:16.553
I think there's a bigger picture here.

01:16.595 --> 01:19.890
All I know is what I saw.

01:22.059 --> 01:23.463
The Marquez boys told me that

01:23.504 --> 01:25.194
this rained down on them
after the explosion.

01:25.236 --> 01:26.818
- Where is it from?
- I don't know.

01:26.860 --> 01:28.524
We're gonna have to hire
an explosives expert.

01:28.565 --> 01:31.156
Yes. It's a war crime.

01:31.198 --> 01:33.246
And if Borns Tech
really did work on this,

01:33.288 --> 01:34.945
then Borns Tech are fucking monsters

01:34.986 --> 01:37.241
and they will kill you
before they let you prove it.

01:37.282 --> 01:39.458
Did that dude just take a picture of us?

01:39.500 --> 01:41.577
This boyfriend of yours,
what does he look like?

01:41.618 --> 01:43.413
It's not him, Dad.

01:43.455 --> 01:45.874
Ever since I took this case,

01:45.916 --> 01:47.626
weird shit is happening to me, okay?

01:47.668 --> 01:50.003
People are following me.
I'm getting pulled over

01:50.045 --> 01:52.131
by the cops, having my ass beat.

01:54.466 --> 01:56.440
At the end of the day,

01:56.482 --> 01:58.262
they're big and we're little,

01:58.303 --> 02:01.500
and they're gonna kill us
and I am terrified.

02:01.542 --> 02:03.079
We're still in the game.

02:03.120 --> 02:05.686
That's the good news.

02:08.396 --> 02:11.984
Think about what's
going down in this case,

02:12.025 --> 02:15.487
then ask yourself how much more
of it you can take,

02:15.529 --> 02:18.740
how many more people
are going to get hurt.

02:18.782 --> 02:19.783
Consider...

02:20.415 --> 02:23.412
one dead client.

02:23.453 --> 02:25.080
It's terrible.

02:25.122 --> 02:26.748
We just have one more witness to call.

02:26.790 --> 02:29.084
We'd like to call
Donald Cooperman to the stand.

02:29.126 --> 02:30.990
Miss Kittridge is going to say

02:31.031 --> 02:33.380
that Mr. Stoltz had
a conversation with you.

02:33.422 --> 02:35.681
- Oh.
- Mr. Cooperman!

02:36.351 --> 02:37.759
Good luck, Billy.

02:37.801 --> 02:38.927
It's our witness list.

02:38.969 --> 02:40.890
What did you expect me to do?

02:40.931 --> 02:42.600
I expect you to be my fucking friend!

02:42.642 --> 02:44.166
You were never my friend

02:44.208 --> 02:45.975
because I fuck guys for a living

02:46.016 --> 02:47.686
and you thought that
I'd be handy for you!

02:47.728 --> 02:49.521
- What?
- That was it!

02:49.563 --> 02:52.774
The jury awards the Larson family damages

02:53.316 --> 02:54.943
in the amount

02:54.968 --> 03:00.157
of $162 million.

03:01.107 --> 03:04.036
Burns you up to think I beat you.

03:04.077 --> 03:06.663
Oh, your friend, Rachel Kennedy,

03:06.705 --> 03:09.833
she wasn't the one we were trying to get.

03:09.875 --> 03:11.689
You were supposed to get it.

03:11.731 --> 03:13.921
She took yours.

DEA, search warrant! DEA, search warrant!

04:15.399 --> 04:16.896
Down on the ground now!

04:16.938 --> 04:18.250
Two left, two left!

04:18.291 --> 04:20.176
Get your ass on the ground!

04:20.218 --> 04:22.864
Two right!

04:25.158 --> 04:26.535
Don't do it!

Suspect down!

04:28.745 --> 04:30.612
Move! Move!

04:30.613 --> 04:31.864
Right clear!

04:33.574 --> 04:35.493
Keep moving.

05:10.752 --> 05:13.072
Rest of the house is clear.

05:13.114 --> 05:15.006
All clear. Last room.

05:15.783 --> 05:17.410
That's a lot of fucking money.

05:17.451 --> 05:18.828
Fuckin' "A."

05:21.664 --> 05:24.959
A joint task force
headed by the LAPD and the DEA

05:25.001 --> 05:27.503
are zeroing in on the La Mano Cartel's

05:27.545 --> 05:30.673
opioid distribution ring
operating in Los Angeles,

05:30.715 --> 05:32.528
Orange and San Diego counties.

05:32.570 --> 05:35.803
Over $25 million in drugs and cash

05:35.845 --> 05:37.263
have been seized so far.

05:37.304 --> 05:40.307
City councilwoman and mayoral
candidate Marisol Silva

05:40.349 --> 05:42.518
has been spearheading
the political pressure

05:42.560 --> 05:44.645
to eradicate drugs in her district.

05:44.687 --> 05:47.314
That's why we're working
hand in hand with the DEA,

05:47.356 --> 05:49.817
to stop these drug distribution networks.

05:49.859 --> 05:52.403
And as your next mayor of Los Angeles,

05:52.445 --> 05:54.739
it will be my priority
to provide treatment

05:54.780 --> 05:58.451
for those who are affected
by opioid addiction.

05:58.492 --> 06:01.537
In other news,
officers responded to a report

06:01.579 --> 06:03.873
of a fight in progress at a 7-Eleven

06:03.914 --> 06:06.167
in the 600 block
of Wilshire and Santa Monica.

06:06.208 --> 06:07.857
When they arrived...

06:07.899 --> 06:10.171
You gonna take him home?

06:10.896 --> 06:13.340
Yeah. I got him.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.219
Be right back.

06:17.261 --> 06:19.346
Take your time. I'm gonna be here late.

06:23.434 --> 06:25.686
You want me to send the guys home?

06:25.728 --> 06:27.313
No, tell them to wait for me.

06:27.354 --> 06:29.289
I don't want you here alone.

06:30.107 --> 06:32.101
Bus stop will be lonely
without them, anyways.

06:32.142 --> 06:33.243
Could you grab my hoodie

06:33.268 --> 06:34.803
- for me, please?
- Yeah.

06:38.381 --> 06:41.077
- Hey, Billy.
- Mm?

06:41.118 --> 06:42.750
Billy, come on.

06:42.792 --> 06:44.330
Let's go home.

06:44.371 --> 06:45.539
Where-where's Trudy and those girls?

06:45.581 --> 06:47.208
Uh, I don't know, buddy.

06:47.249 --> 06:49.043
- Come on. Time to go home.
- Is Trudy... Trudy leave?

06:49.085 --> 06:51.978
- Uh-huh. I think so.
- Oh.

06:52.588 --> 06:54.090
- You all right, bud?
- Mm.

06:54.131 --> 06:55.966
Come on now.

06:59.972 --> 07:01.848
There we go.

07:05.976 --> 07:08.020
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

07:08.062 --> 07:09.688
Hey, Billy, remind me tomorrow.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.376
I'll show you that scissor lift video.

07:11.417 --> 07:12.864
Yeah, okay, honey. Thanks.

07:12.905 --> 07:15.778
It is real funny. Sweet dreams.

07:29.416 --> 07:32.419
Fucking thing. Can you believe
I bought this fucking car?

07:36.173 --> 07:37.800
No, I can't.

07:37.842 --> 07:39.260
- Unbelievable.
- Don't look like you.

07:39.301 --> 07:40.512
No, it don't look like me.

07:40.554 --> 07:41.932
The sticker's still in the fucking thing.

07:41.974 --> 07:43.238
Look at that.

07:44.682 --> 07:47.701
It don't feel like me or look like me.

07:49.228 --> 07:51.730
But the salesman,
this cat gave me a pitch.

07:51.772 --> 07:54.358
He said his wife was sick,
and I'm saving the planet

07:54.400 --> 07:56.585
and all this shit, you know, so...

07:57.444 --> 07:58.795
Yeah.

07:59.488 --> 08:02.408
Anyhow, I'm never gonna drive
the fucking thing.

08:02.449 --> 08:03.868
Do you want it?

08:03.909 --> 08:06.162
No, man. I'm good with the bus.

08:06.203 --> 08:09.206
- Let them worry about the traffic.
- Yeah.

08:09.248 --> 08:11.167
You sure? Oh, I'm not shitting you.

08:11.208 --> 08:14.336
- I'll give it to you.
- I don't want it.

08:18.507 --> 08:20.509
Ah, all right.

08:25.389 --> 08:26.944
There you go, brother.

08:26.986 --> 08:28.893
- Appreciate it.
- No, dude. No, come on.

08:28.934 --> 08:30.321
You got to stop passing money out, okay?

08:30.363 --> 08:32.479
Keep it. I'm good.

08:34.815 --> 08:37.234
You got to stop throwing
money around, you know.

08:37.275 --> 08:38.751
You're gonna run out of it.

08:39.528 --> 08:41.530
Yeah, maybe so. I don't give a shit.

08:41.572 --> 08:43.157
I've run out before.

08:43.198 --> 08:44.992
You could use it.
Buy the kids something, man.

08:45.034 --> 08:46.493
I'm good, Billy. Thank you.

08:46.535 --> 08:49.622
I'm good. Come on. Let's go.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.624
I'm good from here.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.542
- No.
- Yeah.

08:53.584 --> 08:56.212
No way, man. I'm taking you up
'cause, you know, if I don't,

08:56.253 --> 08:58.505
you're gonna end up on the beach
all night.

09:00.507 --> 09:02.343
You know what?

09:02.384 --> 09:03.761
That's what we ought to do.

09:03.802 --> 09:05.846
We ought to go down to the beach
to have a drink.

09:05.888 --> 09:08.474
Frankie can take care
of all that shit, right?

09:08.515 --> 09:10.684
I've seen your car.
I don't trust your choices.

09:10.726 --> 09:12.269
Shut up.

09:12.311 --> 09:13.687
Come on, let's go have
a fucking drink, man.

09:13.729 --> 09:15.356
- No. Come on. Come on, Billy.
- Let's go.

09:15.397 --> 09:17.024
- Come on, Billy. Let's go.
- Oh, look at that.

09:17.066 --> 09:18.776
I always wanted a fucking Indian chick.

09:18.817 --> 09:20.527
Yeah?

09:27.534 --> 09:29.203
I really appreciate it, Oscar.

09:29.245 --> 09:30.955
You don't have to...
have to keep doing this shit.

09:30.996 --> 09:33.958
Babysitting a fucking old man like me.

09:33.999 --> 09:36.502
You go way above and beyond
the call of duty, sir.

09:36.543 --> 09:39.421
Well, can I get you something?
You-you need some water?

09:39.463 --> 09:40.322
How do you feel?

09:40.347 --> 09:41.632
Oh. No, you know how I feel about water.

09:43.342 --> 09:45.110
No, I'm good, bud.

09:45.678 --> 09:47.237
I'm good.

09:55.980 --> 09:59.858
I don't want to do this,
but I need to ask you something.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.278
I'm... I don't want to take advantage.

10:02.919 --> 10:05.197
W-Whatever it is, no sweat. What's up?

10:05.714 --> 10:07.658
I just don't know who else to talk to,

10:07.700 --> 10:09.159
I mean, that's a lawyer.

10:09.592 --> 10:12.329
Um, I didn't even tell Frankie.

10:14.164 --> 10:16.625
I'm embarrassed, I-I guess.

10:16.667 --> 10:18.143
Um...

10:19.003 --> 10:21.187
not embarrassed, but...

10:23.382 --> 10:25.134
I-I don't know the words for it.

10:25.175 --> 10:26.693
Uh...

10:27.177 --> 10:29.805
It's okay, Oscar. What is it?

10:37.604 --> 10:39.622
You know my, uh...

10:41.025 --> 10:45.779
my sons... my two older boys.

10:45.821 --> 10:48.006
Yeah, yeah, I know them.

10:50.675 --> 10:52.870
They're not in some gang shit
again, are they?

10:54.429 --> 10:56.165
Yeah.

10:56.206 --> 10:58.641
Oh, I'm sorry, bud.

10:59.043 --> 11:01.227
I know that's a bitch.

11:03.630 --> 11:06.008
They got shot.

11:06.050 --> 11:07.817
Both of them.

11:09.861 --> 11:11.597
Th-They're dead.

11:11.638 --> 11:15.157
Oh, Oscar. Goddamn it, man, I'm sorry.

11:15.182 --> 11:16.143
Yeah.

11:16.185 --> 11:19.120
- Shit.
- Yeah, so, uh...

11:20.230 --> 11:22.208
Son of a bitch.

11:22.250 --> 11:24.693
They're dead, but I...

11:26.737 --> 11:29.615
...wanted to ask you
something about, uh...

11:29.656 --> 11:31.674
it's...

11:32.910 --> 11:35.746
What-what are you... do-do you
need money for a funeral

11:35.788 --> 11:37.373
or something like that?

11:37.414 --> 11:39.583
- No, no. I don't, I don't...
- You just ask me, man.

11:39.625 --> 11:42.252
- You got it.
- I don't think I need money. Um...

11:43.394 --> 11:45.589
What do you want me to do, man?

11:49.676 --> 11:52.821
I-I don't know. I guess
I just wanted to tell you.

12:00.104 --> 12:01.871
Okay.

12:02.815 --> 12:05.401
Well, if you need anything,
like I said, man.

12:05.875 --> 12:08.487
And if you just want to talk
or whatever it is.

12:08.837 --> 12:10.406
I'll see you tomorrow.

12:10.447 --> 12:12.366
Uh, yeah. I'm sure you will.

12:12.408 --> 12:13.534
You good?

12:13.575 --> 12:14.743
Yeah, I'm fine, man.

12:14.785 --> 12:15.953
Don't worry about me.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.832
Y-You need to take some time off, buddy.

12:22.835 --> 12:24.711
I'm good.

12:50.487 --> 12:52.239
It's open.

12:54.450 --> 12:55.576
Hey, Billy.

12:57.260 --> 12:58.636
Yeah, back here.

13:04.168 --> 13:06.920
Yo, you got a second?

13:09.681 --> 13:11.683
Yeah, I guess so.

13:20.364 --> 13:21.535
How you doing?

13:22.577 --> 13:24.270
Same old shit, you know.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.064
- Yeah, I hear you.
- Yeah.

13:28.192 --> 13:30.319
Okay, um...

13:30.360 --> 13:32.654
Uh, I've been going
to these-these meetings,

13:32.696 --> 13:34.239
and, um...

13:37.508 --> 13:39.719
I just came to apologize...

13:40.370 --> 13:41.888
to you.

13:44.625 --> 13:47.377
I mean, I've been apologizing
to a lot of people lately,

13:47.419 --> 13:50.881
and, um... you're at the top of my list.

13:52.315 --> 13:53.425
So...

13:57.070 --> 13:59.348
I'm sorry for...

13:59.739 --> 14:01.350
everything I put you through.

14:02.951 --> 14:04.853
'Cause the thing is, like,
I know what I did was wrong,

14:04.895 --> 14:06.730
but I don't even know why I did it.

14:06.772 --> 14:09.352
I just... I was just mixed up
in my own shit,

14:09.394 --> 14:11.251
and, uh...

14:12.653 --> 14:14.545
and I took it out on you.

14:17.131 --> 14:18.492
And I betrayed you.

14:22.204 --> 14:24.514
I guess I didn't deserve your friendship.

14:26.724 --> 14:28.184
And I'm sorry.

14:30.311 --> 14:31.257
Okay.

14:36.843 --> 14:39.012
Okay, um...

14:39.054 --> 14:41.056
Well, in case I never see you again...

14:44.868 --> 14:46.829
...just know that I love you.

14:51.316 --> 14:53.443
Okay, bye.

14:53.485 --> 14:54.778
Hey, Brittany.

14:54.820 --> 14:56.446
Hang on a second.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.412
Got something for you.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.887
It's for the Borns Tech case.
It's what I owe you.

15:25.349 --> 15:26.767
Are you serious?

15:28.645 --> 15:30.230
But I stabbed you in the back.

15:30.955 --> 15:34.417
Well, it's for your work, it's
not a humanitarian award, okay.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.591
Thank you.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.493
You're welcome.

15:50.167 --> 15:51.851
Hey, Brittany.

15:59.134 --> 16:02.387
Thanks for coming over. It was
big of you to say all that.

16:29.498 --> 16:31.182
What's up, Oscar?

16:38.048 --> 16:39.982
How you holding up, buddy?

16:47.391 --> 16:50.618
I didn't tell you everything
about my sons.

16:52.370 --> 16:53.730
All right.

16:59.778 --> 17:02.948
Well, my youngest son got arrested.

17:02.989 --> 17:04.714
Your younger son?

17:05.367 --> 17:06.742
You talking about the fiddle player?

17:07.510 --> 17:09.079
Cello. Yeah.

17:09.121 --> 17:11.123
Yeah, Julio.

17:11.806 --> 17:13.458
The hell for?

17:13.500 --> 17:16.381
The cops are saying
that he killed somebody.

17:17.493 --> 17:21.425
That it's gang retaliation
for my other sons,

17:21.465 --> 17:23.426
but it don't make any sense.

17:23.468 --> 17:25.178
- Well, no.
- I mean, no, they were in the gang.

17:25.220 --> 17:28.432
Julio's not. He's a good kid.

17:28.473 --> 17:29.991
Yeah.

17:33.478 --> 17:35.955
I don't have any money for a good lawyer.

17:38.316 --> 17:40.235
I mean, I-I can give you some money.

17:42.670 --> 17:44.906
I mean, I-I'll help you
any way I can like that,

17:44.948 --> 17:46.908
but, I mean, if you're
talking about me, I...

17:47.541 --> 17:49.703
I kind of gave up
murder cases and cocaine

17:49.745 --> 17:51.830
right around the same time.

17:51.872 --> 17:53.248
Don't really do that anymore, so...

17:54.481 --> 17:56.334
Yeah, I-I...

17:56.376 --> 17:59.337
I don't know what lawyer does what.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.189
He's got a public defender, right?

18:02.583 --> 18:04.001
Yeah.

18:06.319 --> 18:07.721
It just looks like he's going down.

18:07.763 --> 18:10.348
Public defender just means
you're fucked, doesn't it?

18:10.390 --> 18:12.601
Well, not necessarily.

18:13.034 --> 18:14.603
I mean, they handle
those cases all the time.

18:14.644 --> 18:17.063
They know the ins and outs, you know.

18:18.607 --> 18:21.067
I mean, I-I can go down
and check on him for you

18:21.092 --> 18:24.488
and talk to the lawyer, see that
everything's square, you know.

18:28.484 --> 18:29.534
Thank you, Billy.

18:29.576 --> 18:30.952
No sweat, man.

18:30.994 --> 18:34.305
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, don't be. I'm happy to.

18:38.732 --> 18:40.212
You sure you don't need any money?

18:41.479 --> 18:42.881
Thank you.

18:47.761 --> 18:49.445
Damn it.

18:53.016 --> 18:56.144
Yeah, I don't know. I just
don't drive hardly at all now.

18:56.186 --> 18:57.938
Too much traffic?

18:57.979 --> 19:00.652
Well, all kind of fucking reasons.

19:02.192 --> 19:04.569
You ever wonder where the hell
people are going?

19:04.611 --> 19:07.572
- No.
- I do.

19:08.047 --> 19:11.243
I just assume they're going
nowhere in a hurry.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.869
Yeah.

19:24.172 --> 19:25.590
Thanks, man.

19:29.010 --> 19:32.605
Hey, Julio. You remember me?

19:32.647 --> 19:35.308
Billy McBride, buddy of
your dad's from Chez Jay.

19:35.350 --> 19:37.018
I remember you. I met you before.

19:37.060 --> 19:39.579
Yeah, a couple times.

19:40.730 --> 19:45.607
So I just, uh... wanted to
come by and check on you,

19:45.648 --> 19:47.125
see if they're treating you okay.

19:47.167 --> 19:49.489
And if they're not,
you can tell me, okay?

19:51.588 --> 19:53.198
I didn't kill anybody.

19:53.342 --> 19:55.303
I don't figure you did.

19:56.830 --> 19:59.958
I went by and saw your
public defender, Ms. Blanchard.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.919
- The blonde lady?
- Yeah, she seems like a...

20:02.961 --> 20:05.005
pretty capable gal, you know.

20:05.646 --> 20:08.174
Yeah, so, I just want
to make sure you had somebody,

20:08.216 --> 20:10.427
you know, to take care of you.

20:10.468 --> 20:13.195
I think you're in good hands with her.

20:13.995 --> 20:16.159
But I do have to ask you, um,

20:16.201 --> 20:18.810
where were you that night
of those murders?

20:18.852 --> 20:20.620
I was home,

20:22.022 --> 20:26.192
just doing schoolwork and
practicing for the orchestra.

20:26.959 --> 20:29.003
That's what your dad said, too.

20:32.824 --> 20:35.952
When will I be able to talk
to my dad and my girlfriend?

20:35.994 --> 20:38.121
You can talk to them pretty soon.

20:41.458 --> 20:43.043
Can I ask you a question?

20:43.084 --> 20:44.461
Sure.

20:45.766 --> 20:47.084
You're a lawyer, right?

20:47.563 --> 20:49.925
Yeah, I am.

20:51.760 --> 20:53.252
Why can't you help me?

20:53.861 --> 20:54.971
I didn't do this.

20:55.013 --> 20:57.891
I-I... I understand that.
I really believe you.

20:58.532 --> 21:02.395
But I don't do capital cases,
that's what your case is.

21:02.953 --> 21:05.315
It's not really my bag right now.

21:08.151 --> 21:09.543
Okay.

21:10.153 --> 21:13.031
You're probably real scared.
That's natural.

21:13.073 --> 21:15.174
Anybody would be.

21:15.867 --> 21:18.203
Just keep your head down,
do what your lawyer tells you,

21:18.244 --> 21:19.970
and she'll sort it all out.

21:20.510 --> 21:21.735
Okay.

21:23.208 --> 21:26.127
All right. I'll come back
and check on you again.

21:26.169 --> 21:27.770
Yeah.

21:28.189 --> 21:32.092
I'll tell your dad I saw you.
Give him a hug for you.

21:32.133 --> 21:34.276
- Thank you.
- You got it.

21:48.233 --> 21:49.526
How's your mom?

21:49.567 --> 21:51.069
She's good.

21:51.111 --> 21:52.487
We actually got along.

21:52.529 --> 21:53.905
Well, that's good.

21:54.339 --> 21:55.865
Is she okay?

21:55.907 --> 21:58.118
Yeah, she wants me to come back to London

21:58.159 --> 21:59.911
to visit over winter break.

21:59.953 --> 22:02.497
She's dating a woman
whose family owns a castle.

22:02.539 --> 22:04.541
What, is she some kind of
princess or something?

22:04.582 --> 22:08.628
No, I just, I think
they just own a castle.

22:08.670 --> 22:10.201
There you go, bud. Appreciate it.

22:10.243 --> 22:11.798
Whoa. Thanks a lot, brother.

22:11.840 --> 22:13.341
All right, honey.

22:15.343 --> 22:17.470
Did you just give that guy a $200 tip?

22:17.512 --> 22:21.099
- Yeah, I'm sure he can use it.
- That's very nice of you.

22:21.141 --> 22:23.143
Well...

22:23.184 --> 22:26.146
Oh, my gosh, I haven't seen
a blue sky in so long.

22:26.187 --> 22:27.814
Yeah, I bet.

22:27.856 --> 22:30.249
I've missed it.

22:31.401 --> 22:35.447
The palm trees... and kale salads.

22:35.488 --> 22:38.033
Yeah, I know. Standard thing
for people to say is,

22:38.074 --> 22:40.243
"You know, the food's gotten
a lot better in London."

22:40.285 --> 22:41.394
- Mm.
- They've been saying that

22:41.419 --> 22:42.360
for 30 fucking years.

22:42.402 --> 22:45.331
There it is, honey.

22:45.373 --> 22:47.709
- Holy crap.
- Yeah.

22:47.751 --> 22:48.877
- This one?
- Yeah.

22:48.918 --> 22:50.837
- This is our house?
- Yeah.

22:50.879 --> 22:53.006
You freaking kidding me?

22:53.048 --> 22:56.259
Dad, it's gorgeous.

22:56.301 --> 22:57.969
How much did it cost?

22:58.011 --> 23:00.055
More than it would if it were in Pacoima.

23:00.096 --> 23:03.433
Hmm. I'll Zillow it.

23:03.475 --> 23:05.477
Hurry up, hurry up.

23:08.287 --> 23:11.316
God, I'm starving.
Do we have anything to eat?

23:11.357 --> 23:12.817
Yeah, there-there's...

23:12.859 --> 23:15.570
Don't even bother. I forgot to
go to the grocery store, honey.

23:15.612 --> 23:17.030
- I'm sorry.
- Wow.

23:17.072 --> 23:19.157
You can just fill it up
with whatever you want to.

23:19.799 --> 23:21.284
- Dad.
- I know.

23:21.326 --> 23:22.802
I-I know, I know.

23:31.461 --> 23:34.146
Are you still living at the Ocean Lodge?

23:34.756 --> 23:36.630
Well, I figured I'd wait
till you got back, you know,

23:36.672 --> 23:38.468
before I moved in here.
What the hell am I gonna do

23:38.510 --> 23:39.969
with this place by myself?

23:42.847 --> 23:46.434
- So, work's been keeping you busy?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

23:46.476 --> 23:50.105
- You working?
- Yeah, off and on, you know.

23:50.146 --> 23:52.107
Bits and pieces here and there.

23:52.706 --> 23:55.360
So what do you, like, do all day?

23:56.252 --> 23:58.363
Different stuff, you know.

23:58.404 --> 24:00.365
What do you do all day?

24:01.757 --> 24:03.368
How's the drinking?

24:03.409 --> 24:04.661
It's great.

24:04.702 --> 24:07.997
Going great. Come on.

24:08.039 --> 24:10.416
You just got here, let's not
start that shit, okay, please?

24:10.458 --> 24:13.419
You're not eating.

24:14.061 --> 24:15.421
You're drinking more.

24:15.463 --> 24:17.924
You're pissing away all your money,

24:17.966 --> 24:19.384
and you're still living at the motel,

24:19.425 --> 24:21.052
- and I'm worried about you.
- What-what are you?

24:21.094 --> 24:24.015
Sam Spade or something?
How do you know what I'm doing?

24:24.056 --> 24:26.057
Dad...

24:28.560 --> 24:30.520
I know because Marva told me.

24:30.562 --> 24:32.397
- But you can't tell her...
- You sneaky little shit.

24:32.438 --> 24:34.566
...that I told you. I promised
I wouldn't say anythihng.

24:34.607 --> 24:35.692
- W-What the fuck is this?
- You're really making

24:35.733 --> 24:37.209
a big deal out of nothing.

24:37.234 --> 24:38.296
- Uh, you barely said
- And not you.

24:38.321 --> 24:39.307
Anything about the house.

24:39.349 --> 24:40.738
- I mean, it's great, Dad.
- Look. Yeah, exactly.

24:40.780 --> 24:43.449
It's great, I said that.
I said it was great.

24:43.491 --> 24:45.696
I mean, it's a fake orange.

24:45.737 --> 24:46.934
What does that have to do with anything?

24:46.976 --> 24:48.413
What do you want me to say?

24:48.454 --> 24:49.747
It's-it's beautiful.

24:49.789 --> 24:53.418
It looks very... clean.

24:56.980 --> 24:58.565
Okay.

25:00.175 --> 25:02.594
I'm sorry, it's-it's really nice.

25:02.635 --> 25:04.846
- I love it.
- Yeah, well, good.

25:04.888 --> 25:06.848
Anyway, welcome home, honey.

25:17.336 --> 25:18.421
What's up, Marva?

25:18.462 --> 25:20.354
- Oh! You're up.
- Yeah.

25:20.395 --> 25:24.324
Oh. I brought you some chicken salad.

25:24.365 --> 25:26.201
Well, I appreciate that, honey,
but you don't have to keep

25:26.242 --> 25:27.994
- doing this, all right?
- Oh, I just want to make sure

25:28.036 --> 25:29.996
that you're eating.

25:30.038 --> 25:34.584
Okay, so "frequentation
of daze," D-A-Z-E?

25:35.919 --> 25:37.295
Frequentation?

25:37.337 --> 25:38.880
Seven letters.

25:38.922 --> 25:40.856
Um...

25:42.107 --> 25:43.718
"Tripping"?

25:44.273 --> 25:45.220
No.

25:45.261 --> 25:46.804
- One-one letter too many. Yeah.
- Oh.

25:46.846 --> 25:48.389
Maybe "triping."

25:48.431 --> 25:49.641
Don't want that, do we?

25:49.682 --> 25:51.267
So how does, uh...

25:51.309 --> 25:53.187
how's Denise like the new house?

25:53.768 --> 25:57.106
You should know, since you guys
are big pen pals now, huh?

25:57.873 --> 25:59.776
- Busted.
- Yeah.

25:59.817 --> 26:01.194
She just worries about you.

26:01.236 --> 26:02.237
Yeah, I know.

26:02.278 --> 26:03.363
I know. I know.

26:03.404 --> 26:05.573
Well, I will let you be.

26:05.615 --> 26:07.408
Um...

26:07.450 --> 26:09.410
Just let me know
if you need anything, okay?

26:09.452 --> 26:10.828
Okay, I will. Thanks, honey.

26:10.870 --> 26:11.955
Okay, good.

26:11.996 --> 26:13.623
Oh, and, Marva, you know,

26:13.665 --> 26:16.167
Denise doesn't need
to know everything about me.

26:16.209 --> 26:17.710
You got that, right?

26:17.752 --> 26:19.545
I'm good at keeping secrets.

26:19.587 --> 26:21.506
Not so far.

26:22.231 --> 26:23.508
I'll be better.

26:23.549 --> 26:24.968
Okay.

26:25.567 --> 26:26.636
Bye-bye.

26:26.678 --> 26:28.388
Bye.

26:32.684 --> 26:34.894
Fuck is 67?

26:46.406 --> 26:48.032
Mr. McBride?

26:48.590 --> 26:49.575
Yeah.

26:49.617 --> 26:51.536
Hi, I'm Marisol Silva.

26:51.577 --> 26:53.705
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you, too.

26:53.746 --> 26:56.124
The manager at the motel said
I'd find you here.

26:56.165 --> 26:58.543
Yeah, he'd know.

26:58.584 --> 27:01.004
Um, I'm a friend of the Suarez family,

27:01.045 --> 27:02.422
and I reached out to Oscar,

27:02.463 --> 27:05.216
and he... he said you visited Julio.

27:05.258 --> 27:06.342
Yeah.

27:06.384 --> 27:07.552
Are you taking his case?

27:07.593 --> 27:10.013
- No.
- Oh, I, uh...

27:10.054 --> 27:12.598
I got the impression from Oscar
that you were taking his case.

27:12.640 --> 27:15.435
Nah, that was a misunderstanding.

27:16.076 --> 27:18.688
I visited Julio, but I just went
to check in on him,

27:18.730 --> 27:20.231
see if he had
good representation and all.

27:20.273 --> 27:21.482
So does he?

27:21.524 --> 27:22.984
- Yeah, I think so.
- Good.

27:23.026 --> 27:24.694
Good, good, good.

27:24.736 --> 27:26.571
He's very special to me.

27:26.612 --> 27:29.073
I-I watched him grow up, and...

27:29.115 --> 27:32.118
he's very talented,
and he has a good heart.

27:32.160 --> 27:34.370
Yeah, he seems like an okay kid.

27:35.621 --> 27:37.623
I hope he's doing all right.

27:38.182 --> 27:39.542
I guess he's as all right

27:39.584 --> 27:41.961
as an innocent kid in jail
can be, you know?

27:45.821 --> 27:47.008
Would you visit him again?

27:47.050 --> 27:51.304
Uh... it will make me
feel better if you do.

27:52.196 --> 27:53.765
I'm sure I will.

27:53.806 --> 27:55.308
Thank you.

27:55.350 --> 27:58.686
I don't know when I can get in
and see him.

27:58.728 --> 28:01.606
I'm sure running for mayor
takes up a lot of time, huh?

28:01.647 --> 28:05.068
See, I... I couldn't tell
if you recognized me or not.

28:05.109 --> 28:06.944
Some people don't follow politics.

28:08.872 --> 28:10.915
Yeah, I keep up a little.

28:16.621 --> 28:21.417
Um, well, I know you're not his lawyer,

28:21.459 --> 28:25.421
but if there's anything I can do
to help in his case,

28:25.463 --> 28:27.174
call me, please.

28:27.215 --> 28:28.299
All right.

28:28.341 --> 28:30.134
Here. This is my card.

28:30.176 --> 28:31.733
You know what? I'm gonna
give you my personal phone.

28:31.758 --> 28:32.730
Okay.

28:32.772 --> 28:35.932
So, uh... have a good night.

28:35.973 --> 28:37.767
Yeah, you, too.

28:37.809 --> 28:39.159
Oh, hang on a second.

28:41.646 --> 28:43.898
Why don't you stick around
and have one with me?

28:43.940 --> 28:45.775
Have one what?

28:45.817 --> 28:47.193
Oh, you know, have a little drink.

28:47.235 --> 28:49.278
- Oh, uh...
- You know, a drink.

28:49.962 --> 28:52.407
It wouldn't look good
for a mayoral candidate

28:52.448 --> 28:57.094
to be-be drinking
out of a bottle on the pier.

28:58.121 --> 29:02.875
There's eyes everywhere,
and social media's a bitch.

29:02.917 --> 29:05.044
Yeah, I guess so.

29:05.086 --> 29:06.879
There's really hardly anybody
out here, though.

29:06.921 --> 29:08.401
There's not a fucking soul down there.

29:08.443 --> 29:09.966
Pardon my French.

29:10.007 --> 29:11.843
No, well, you never know.

29:11.884 --> 29:14.095
But thank you so much for the offer.

29:14.137 --> 29:15.805
- Yeah, sure.
- Maybe another time.

29:15.847 --> 29:17.598
- Yeah.
- You know, with glasses, and...

29:17.640 --> 29:19.100
everything.

29:19.142 --> 29:20.935
- Cool.
- Okay.

29:20.977 --> 29:22.854
Oh, let me ask you a question.

29:22.895 --> 29:24.621
Uh-huh?

29:25.815 --> 29:27.525
Do I look depressed to you?

29:28.083 --> 29:30.236
Depressed? Uh...

29:30.278 --> 29:32.269
- Well, my daughter says
I'm depressed.

29:32.311 --> 29:34.115
- Oh. Oh, I see.
- Yeah.

29:34.157 --> 29:35.575
- I'm-I'm sorry.
- I should... I'm sorry.

29:35.616 --> 29:38.119
No, I shouldn't be telling you
personal things like that,

29:38.161 --> 29:39.704
- you know? I'm sorry, we just met.
- No, it's okay. Really.

29:39.745 --> 29:42.373
You know? I mean, it's kind of stupid.

29:44.417 --> 29:46.461
I tend to think about the past a lot,

29:46.502 --> 29:48.796
instead of the future, so maybe...

29:48.838 --> 29:51.090
that's part of it, I know.

29:51.132 --> 29:52.341
See, there I go again...

29:52.383 --> 29:54.010
...saying personal shit to you.

29:54.051 --> 29:56.053
- It's okay. It's fine.
- Sorry about that.

29:57.680 --> 29:59.849
Uh, I better go now.

29:59.891 --> 30:02.185
- Yeah.
- But thank you for the offer.

30:02.226 --> 30:03.511
You need me to walk you
to your car or anything?

30:03.536 --> 30:04.520
No, it's fine.

30:04.562 --> 30:06.163
- You sure?
- Yes.

30:07.664 --> 30:09.025
Hey, you're pretty cool

30:09.066 --> 30:10.860
- for a mayor.
- Thank you.

30:10.902 --> 30:13.170
But I'm not a mayor yet.

30:14.113 --> 30:15.781
It was up to me, you would be.

30:41.365 --> 30:42.767
What's up, Roman?

30:42.808 --> 30:44.810
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

30:46.979 --> 30:48.689
Appreciate you coming out.

30:48.731 --> 30:50.441
Yeah, I didn't know this was your case.

30:50.483 --> 30:53.444
No, it's not.
Uh, I'm doing it for a friend.

30:54.211 --> 30:55.488
Another lawyer?

30:55.530 --> 30:57.865
Nah, I know the suspect's dad.

30:57.907 --> 30:59.909
- Huh.
- Rough deal.

30:59.951 --> 31:02.912
Yeah, well, it's-it's too bad 'cause, uh,

31:02.954 --> 31:04.956
this one's pretty cut and dried.

31:04.997 --> 31:06.711
You mind showing me through?

31:08.558 --> 31:10.002
I owe you one, by the way.

31:10.044 --> 31:12.255
No. No, you don't,
'cause this never happened.

31:12.296 --> 31:14.215
I hear you.

31:14.257 --> 31:15.987
- How's the family?
- Okay.

31:16.029 --> 31:17.427
- I got a new one.
- Yeah?

31:17.469 --> 31:19.049
- Yeah.
- Keeping you up nights?

31:19.091 --> 31:20.846
Oh, absolutely.

31:20.888 --> 31:22.098
Fucking crazy.

31:22.139 --> 31:23.699
Yeah, I'll bet.

31:29.246 --> 31:31.190
So the first victim...

31:32.057 --> 31:33.859
is Marcos Peña.

31:34.501 --> 31:36.779
He was shot from the doorway.

31:36.821 --> 31:38.406
Had a 9mm on him.

31:38.447 --> 31:39.782
- Mm-hmm.
- Not fired.

31:40.757 --> 31:43.202
Victim number two is Hunter Friedman.

31:43.719 --> 31:45.496
Tried to run.

31:45.971 --> 31:47.331
Hunter was unarmed.

31:47.373 --> 31:49.417
Huh. That's interesting.

31:52.461 --> 31:54.213
So what's the white kid's deal, anyway?

31:54.255 --> 31:56.465
He's a rich kid from Brentwood.

31:56.507 --> 31:58.050
- Yeah?
- Goes to a private school.

31:58.092 --> 32:00.177
His parents are hotshots
in entertainment law.

32:00.219 --> 32:02.096
- Was he here buying?
- That's what we're thinking.

32:02.138 --> 32:05.016
There's almost 40 grand in cash,
and a shit-ton of pills.

32:05.057 --> 32:07.435
You don't leave that behind
if it's a straight-up robbery.

32:08.635 --> 32:12.273
Uh, our theory is that your
friend's son took out Marcos,

32:12.315 --> 32:15.026
someone we were circling for
the murder of his own brothers,

32:15.625 --> 32:17.570
and the Friedman kid
was collateral damage.

32:17.612 --> 32:19.739
Well, that's the obvious theory.

32:19.780 --> 32:21.949
Well, nine times out of ten,
obvious is right.

32:21.991 --> 32:24.051
Occam's razor?

32:25.077 --> 32:27.246
You know, the kid's got an alibi, Keith.

32:27.288 --> 32:29.373
Who's that? Your buddy? His dad?

32:29.415 --> 32:31.042
Mm-hmm.

32:31.475 --> 32:32.668
We've got an eyewitness,

32:32.710 --> 32:34.253
says the Suarez kid was here, Billy.

32:34.295 --> 32:36.839
- Who's the eyewitness?
- Guy across the street.

32:37.230 --> 32:39.175
He was out walking his dog
under the overpass.

32:39.216 --> 32:42.053
- By a dirty couch?
- By a dirty couch.

32:42.569 --> 32:44.889
He said he heard gunshots, and
then he saw somebody matching

32:44.930 --> 32:48.100
the Suarez kid's description
come running out of the house,

32:48.142 --> 32:51.228
go up the hill,
past the chain-link fence.

32:51.270 --> 32:52.855
Huh.

32:53.610 --> 32:54.594
Okay.

32:54.636 --> 32:56.150
- Okay?
- Yeah.

32:56.192 --> 32:57.610
I should get you out of here, Billy.

32:57.652 --> 32:59.278
All right. I appreciate it.

32:59.320 --> 33:00.446
Good to see you.

33:00.488 --> 33:02.172
You, too, man.

33:41.711 --> 33:43.656
Hey, buddy!

33:43.698 --> 33:44.865
Come here a minute.

33:45.507 --> 33:47.034
What do you want?

33:47.076 --> 33:49.078
Just come here!

34:02.197 --> 34:03.741
Can you help me do something?

34:03.766 --> 34:05.268
No.

34:05.293 --> 34:06.887
All right, I was gonna give you
a hundred bucks,

34:06.929 --> 34:08.431
but if you don't want it,

34:08.472 --> 34:10.474
I'll just get some other
little shit to do it.

34:10.516 --> 34:11.976
Fuck you, man.

34:12.016 --> 34:14.137
That's not very good language, is it?

34:14.956 --> 34:16.107
To do what?

34:16.455 --> 34:18.259
See that little blue house down there?

34:18.620 --> 34:20.359
I want you to stand at the door,

34:21.126 --> 34:22.402
and then I want you
to run around the side,

34:22.445 --> 34:23.904
and up by that chain-link fence

34:23.946 --> 34:25.906
up to the next street there. That's it.

34:26.922 --> 34:29.452
Is this some bullshit
so you can just steal my bike?

34:30.128 --> 34:31.565
The hell would I want with your bike?

34:31.607 --> 34:33.033
It's not even big enough for you.

34:33.074 --> 34:34.290
Give me the money first.

34:34.973 --> 34:36.891
Little businessman, aren't you?

34:38.018 --> 34:39.587
All right.

34:42.647 --> 34:43.882
There you go.

34:43.924 --> 34:45.301
Give me the bike.

34:46.275 --> 34:47.908
I'll give it to you after, okay?

34:48.456 --> 34:49.987
- Okay, man.
- All right.

35:02.777 --> 35:04.111
You ready?

35:04.153 --> 35:06.614
Yeah! Go for it.

35:31.847 --> 35:33.849
Shot!

35:33.891 --> 35:37.645
Good. Every time.

35:37.686 --> 35:40.022
- Come on.
- You like that, Romie?

35:40.064 --> 35:42.274
- Back, back, back.
- You like that? You gonna bring it?

35:42.316 --> 35:43.526
- Come on.
- You gonna bring it?

35:45.528 --> 35:47.154
- Ball, ball, ball!
- Take me!

35:48.989 --> 35:50.074
Ah, fuck!

35:50.115 --> 35:51.598
Goddamn it!

35:51.640 --> 35:53.118
Told you.

35:53.160 --> 35:55.996
- The fuck, dude?
- I told him to stay out.

35:56.038 --> 35:57.164
I fucking pull up with a hamstring,

35:57.206 --> 35:58.290
and you fucking tackle me.

35:58.332 --> 35:59.458
- You serious?
- Yes.

35:59.500 --> 36:00.709
What, I'm supposed to know that?

36:00.751 --> 36:02.127
Jesus Christ, Danny.

36:06.882 --> 36:09.134
Uncle Creaky. Dude,

36:09.176 --> 36:11.178
I'm sorry, brother, but you know
you can't take me off

36:11.220 --> 36:12.680
- the dribble.
- This is fucking ridiculous, man.

36:12.721 --> 36:14.640
I was so far past you
when you tackled me,

36:14.682 --> 36:15.724
it's fucking ridiculous.

36:15.766 --> 36:17.360
Aw, you're gonna cry about it?

36:17.401 --> 36:18.460
Fuck you.

36:18.501 --> 36:20.855
Dude. Just get a massage, put it on me.

36:20.896 --> 36:22.898
- I'm-a take you up on that.
- That's why I offered.

36:22.940 --> 36:25.128
Seriously, go to Koreatown.
Get yourself a handy.

36:25.170 --> 36:26.777
Yeah, that's just what I need.

36:26.819 --> 36:29.754
- Fucking STD from Koreatown.
- Yeah.

36:30.739 --> 36:32.449
So listen, we're still
in good shape, right?

36:32.491 --> 36:35.035
They still got that kid in custody.

36:35.635 --> 36:36.829
Yeah.

36:36.871 --> 36:38.289
You're a lucky prick.

36:38.931 --> 36:40.765
I'd say we're both pretty lucky.

36:43.294 --> 36:45.421
Well, my luck better not run out,

36:45.462 --> 36:46.797
'cause I had somebody primed and ready

36:46.839 --> 36:48.166
to take the fall for this.

36:48.208 --> 36:49.592
Use him on the next one.

36:50.275 --> 36:52.277
I'm not doing this again.

36:53.137 --> 36:54.513
My stomach is in fucking knots.

36:54.555 --> 36:56.015
Well, get over your fucking stomach.

36:56.056 --> 36:57.824
Take some fucking Pepto-Bismol.
You're serious?

36:57.865 --> 36:59.659
Dude, you don't fucking get this.

37:01.483 --> 37:02.912
I got a call.

37:04.273 --> 37:06.191
Billy McBride is
sniffing around this case.

37:06.233 --> 37:08.110
- Who the fuck is Billy McBride?
- He's a fucking lawyer

37:08.152 --> 37:10.654
who just won $50 million
in a wrongful death suit, okay.

37:10.696 --> 37:12.239
- I've known him for years.
- Never heard of him.

37:12.281 --> 37:14.537
- He's a bulldog, all right?
- I don't give a fuck what he is.

37:14.578 --> 37:15.743
- If he latches onto this...
- I'm not scared, dude.

37:15.784 --> 37:16.744
...he's not letting go.

37:16.785 --> 37:17.953
I'm not fucking scared.

37:17.995 --> 37:19.371
We're so lucky right now,

37:19.413 --> 37:21.047
we should be out playing
the fucking lottery, okay?

37:21.089 --> 37:23.642
I don't need to play the lottery, right?

37:24.809 --> 37:26.462
You're gonna send me a text, right?

37:26.503 --> 37:29.423
Yeah. That's how we do it, right?

37:29.465 --> 37:31.524
Did you check your phone?

37:32.384 --> 37:33.719
- Did you?
- I'll check it.

37:33.761 --> 37:35.804
You'll check it.
Check your fucking texts.

37:35.846 --> 37:37.181
Look, dude, I got to go.

37:37.222 --> 37:39.475
Give my love to Mary.

37:39.516 --> 37:41.518
Ice that thing down, okay?

38:08.170 --> 38:11.799
- Headed out, Mr. Roman?
- Yeah.

38:11.840 --> 38:13.842
Roberto, I, uh...

38:13.884 --> 38:15.511
if I can make it to my car.

38:15.552 --> 38:16.971
I pulled my hamstring playing hoops.

38:17.012 --> 38:19.037
Can use the employee entrance
if you want.

38:19.078 --> 38:20.140
It's quicker.

38:20.182 --> 38:22.643
I'll be okay. Thanks.

38:22.685 --> 38:24.061
Just don't ever get old.

38:24.103 --> 38:26.105
I'm not planning on it. Thanks.

38:26.146 --> 38:27.982
Have a good day.

38:42.006 --> 38:44.873
Motherfucking fuck!

38:49.837 --> 38:51.463
Danny, I can hear you stress-eating.

38:51.505 --> 38:53.305
Okay, what do we got here?
We got Carl's Jr.

38:53.347 --> 38:54.508
or Panda Express.

38:54.550 --> 38:55.509
What is it?

38:55.551 --> 38:56.844
It's a Famous Star with Cheese.

38:56.885 --> 38:58.554
Why do you fucking care what I'm eating?

38:58.595 --> 39:00.305
Oh, God. But a diet soda, right?

39:00.347 --> 39:02.850
Yeah, look, did you see
the fucking picture?!

39:02.891 --> 39:04.935
Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.

39:04.977 --> 39:06.895
And... are you sure that's the same kid?

39:06.937 --> 39:09.106
Yeah, I'm fucking positive, man!

39:09.148 --> 39:10.774
It's a huge fucking billboard.
It's one of those kids

39:10.816 --> 39:13.110
from her-her community
center project or whatever.

39:13.152 --> 39:16.488
Okay, all right, I can see how
this could be a huge problem.

39:16.530 --> 39:19.575
So, I will talk to her,
but don't panic, okay? Relax.

39:19.616 --> 39:21.156
You can see where it's a huge problem?

39:21.198 --> 39:22.286
Tom, listen to me,

39:22.327 --> 39:25.222
you need to be very fucking
clear with her, okay?

39:25.264 --> 39:27.583
Danny, Danny, I'm going to be
very me with her,

39:27.624 --> 39:29.334
which is how we got
this far in the first place.

39:29.376 --> 39:31.295
- No, being you is not a good...
- Bye-bye.

39:36.508 --> 39:38.635
So, the whole time
Marisol's talking to him,

39:38.677 --> 39:40.054
all I can focus on is

39:40.095 --> 39:42.306
this piece of banana stuck in his beard.

39:42.347 --> 39:43.640
Yes, the banana in the beard.

39:43.682 --> 39:45.765
I love that story, uh, but I do think

39:45.807 --> 39:47.644
it's time to be done with the small talk.

39:47.686 --> 39:50.022
Love small talk,
but how's Mr. Vargas doing?

39:50.064 --> 39:55.069
Uh, we're not quite there yet,
but I'm-I'm working on him.

39:55.110 --> 39:57.196
Okay, well, I have the investors excited,

39:57.237 --> 39:58.739
the time to strike is now.

39:58.781 --> 40:00.449
- I need to get that property rezoned.
- Mm-hmm.

40:00.491 --> 40:02.284
So, what can we do to get Vargas's vote?

40:03.426 --> 40:05.579
I think a soccer field
for his youth program

40:05.621 --> 40:06.872
will probably lock it in.

40:06.914 --> 40:08.749
Done. E-mail Loomis. What else?

40:08.791 --> 40:10.250
Wait, you don't even want
to know how much it costs?

40:10.292 --> 40:12.086
No, I do not. I already know
it's a drop in the bucket

40:12.127 --> 40:14.338
compared to the big picture.
What else does he need?

40:14.379 --> 40:16.965
I think a soccer field
will be fine for now.

40:17.007 --> 40:18.842
If he needs anything else,
I'll let you know.

40:18.884 --> 40:20.151
Good.

40:20.719 --> 40:22.596
Well, I think that makes us done here.

40:22.638 --> 40:26.303
Um, we should talk about Julio Suarez.

40:26.345 --> 40:28.393
- Tom...
- Marisol...

40:28.435 --> 40:31.271
- Okay, ju-just listen to me.
- I'm listening.

40:31.746 --> 40:33.583
I've known him since he was eight.

40:33.625 --> 40:35.275
- I know. I know.
- He's one of my kids.

40:35.317 --> 40:37.152
A success story for the community center,

40:37.194 --> 40:39.780
which is the foundation of my campaign.

40:39.822 --> 40:41.198
- Listen, I understand.
- Yeah.

40:41.240 --> 40:44.368
Now I'm gonna tell you something
insensitive, shitty, but true.

40:44.409 --> 40:46.078
You need to distance yourself
from this kid.

40:46.120 --> 40:47.871
Okay, we're gonna have to reimagine

40:47.913 --> 40:49.123
your billboard campaigns around town,

40:49.164 --> 40:50.707
because you're standing
right next to him.

40:50.749 --> 40:52.668
So it doesn't matter that
I believe he's innocent?

40:54.419 --> 40:55.921
We have to think about
the bigger picture.

40:57.673 --> 40:59.216
You're just worried about the election.

40:59.258 --> 41:00.717
- I am worried about the election.
- Mm-hmm.

41:00.759 --> 41:02.261
She's worried about the election,

41:02.302 --> 41:03.679
and you should be worried
about the election, too,

41:03.720 --> 41:05.347
because the election is
right around the corner.

41:05.389 --> 41:07.057
And remember, when you're mayor,

41:07.099 --> 41:09.143
you're gonna be in a much better
position to help this kid.

41:09.184 --> 41:10.978
- That could be too late.
- No, it won't be too late.

41:11.019 --> 41:12.521
This is a double murder case.
They take months,

41:12.563 --> 41:13.939
sometimes years to sort out.

41:13.981 --> 41:15.524
Okay? She knows I'm right.

41:15.566 --> 41:17.303
Distance yourself from the kid.

41:17.344 --> 41:18.986
Focus on the campaign.

41:19.027 --> 41:21.113
Then we can do so much more.

41:21.155 --> 41:22.447
Oh, yeah? For Julio or for you?

41:22.489 --> 41:24.677
For all three of us.

41:24.719 --> 41:26.994
Even Dr. Small Talk over here.

41:27.035 --> 41:28.537
She's my favorite.
She loves me, by the way.

41:28.579 --> 41:29.872
How was everything?

41:29.913 --> 41:31.748
Ryan, that wine was fucking divine.

41:31.790 --> 41:33.167
What was that again?

41:33.208 --> 41:34.835
The Sancerre Clos la Neore, 2005.

41:34.877 --> 41:36.086
The Sance-hulu-what?

41:36.128 --> 41:38.187
Come here, come here.

41:39.423 --> 41:42.259
Um, would you do me a favor and, like,

41:42.301 --> 41:43.969
sneak a case of that for me?

41:44.011 --> 41:46.263
I'll pay for it,
you hide it away... teamwork.

41:46.305 --> 41:48.056
- Sounds good.
- Thank you, my friend.

41:48.098 --> 41:49.474
Let me get these plates out of your way.

41:49.516 --> 41:50.767
I love this guy.

41:50.809 --> 41:52.603
Ryan, I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry,

41:52.644 --> 41:55.263
but I've never noticed before...
how did you lose your finger?

41:56.481 --> 41:57.858
No, no, no, don't be embarrassed, no, no.

41:57.900 --> 41:59.109
Imperfections are what make us beautiful.

41:59.151 --> 42:01.486
- We need to run. Yeah.
- Ah, yes.

42:01.528 --> 42:03.197
They're busy, busy.
She's gonna be the next mayor

42:03.238 --> 42:04.823
of Los Angeles, Marisol Silva.

42:04.865 --> 42:06.617
I'm very aware, Mr. Wyatt. I'm a big fan.

42:06.658 --> 42:08.994
Hey, hey, cut the "Mr. Wyatt"
shit, please.

42:09.036 --> 42:11.538
Sorry. Tom.

42:11.580 --> 42:12.915
And you have my vote, Ms. Silva.

42:12.956 --> 42:15.751
Thank you, Ryan. Thank you again, Tom.

42:15.792 --> 42:18.503
Hey, I'm always here for you guys.

42:18.545 --> 42:20.172
It is always a pleasure.

42:20.214 --> 42:22.132
And I'm always here for you, too, Ryan.

42:22.174 --> 42:23.717
Thanks, Mr. Wyatt.

42:23.759 --> 42:25.276
Tom.

42:51.036 --> 42:52.579
Sí.

43:43.171 --> 43:45.132
Excuse me, sir.

43:45.173 --> 43:47.801
You said you wanted to know right away.

43:47.843 --> 43:50.220
I talked to Tom Wyatt.

43:50.262 --> 43:53.724
He said everything is under control.

44:17.748 --> 44:20.500
I get nervous with speaking
in front of people.

44:21.100 --> 44:23.003
Oh, hell, don't worry about it.
Everybody gets nervous

44:23.045 --> 44:26.173
doing this mess. You're not alone.

44:26.214 --> 44:28.175
Public defender's just gonna
ask you some questions.

44:28.216 --> 44:31.053
Just remember what we went over.
You're good.

44:32.804 --> 44:34.765
I was at home.

44:34.806 --> 44:38.477
Uh, Julio was doing
his homework in his room.

44:38.518 --> 44:40.170
I heard him practicing cello.

44:40.211 --> 44:41.938
Yeah, all that stuff.

44:46.401 --> 44:48.737
Like, is there gonna be an audience?

44:48.779 --> 44:50.697
No, this is just a preliminary hearing,

44:50.739 --> 44:53.075
so there'll be a judge
and a court reporter,

44:53.116 --> 44:55.077
bailiff, that's it.
It's easy as pie, man.

44:58.997 --> 45:00.624
You look very handsome.

45:04.294 --> 45:06.254
Been a while since I had a real suit.

45:07.881 --> 45:10.801
Just tell the truth
as you know it, that's all.

45:10.842 --> 45:12.844
And remember, you're
doing this for your kids,

45:12.886 --> 45:14.638
so you'll be focused.

45:14.679 --> 45:16.264
Don't worry.

45:20.754 --> 45:21.922
You're a good man.

45:22.303 --> 45:24.773
Ah, back at you, buddy.

45:24.815 --> 45:27.625
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

45:28.110 --> 45:31.154
I want to show the guys this.

45:31.196 --> 45:33.198
They've never seen me in a suit.

45:33.240 --> 45:34.741
You ought to go over there
and bus a few tables

45:34.783 --> 45:36.158
in front of them in that.

45:37.661 --> 45:39.011
See you later.

45:39.663 --> 45:41.915
You know, I think I'm just
gonna type up his statement,

45:41.957 --> 45:43.583
just so we have a record of it.

45:43.625 --> 45:45.335
Yeah, well, that's a good idea.

45:58.682 --> 46:00.283
Hey!

46:08.066 --> 46:09.985
Call somebody!

46:10.520 --> 46:12.362
Oscar?

46:12.404 --> 46:14.251
Oscar, stay with me, buddy.

46:14.292 --> 46:16.158
Okay? They're on the way.

46:16.199 --> 46:18.285
Got people on the way.
Just keep looking at me.

46:18.326 --> 46:19.911
Look at me, Oscar, look at me.

46:19.953 --> 46:21.621
Stay with me. Stay with me.

46:21.663 --> 46:22.789
It's okay.

46:22.831 --> 46:23.915
It's all right, buddy.

46:23.957 --> 46:25.375
Look me in the eye, okay?

46:25.417 --> 46:26.835
Just keep looking me in the eye.

46:26.877 --> 46:28.295
Stay with me. They're on the way.

46:28.336 --> 46:30.297
- It's all right. Come on.
- Billy. Billy!

46:30.338 --> 46:32.174
- Stay back, now.
- Billy, what happened?

46:32.215 --> 46:33.842
- Stay with me.
- No...

46:33.884 --> 46:35.635
Look at me. Look at me.

46:39.175 --> 46:42.522
No.

46:47.022 --> 46:48.565
It's okay, it's okay.

46:51.568 --> 46:52.944
No.
