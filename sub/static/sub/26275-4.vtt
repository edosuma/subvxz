WEBVTT

00:05.081 --> 00:07.750
Hey, happy Halloween, Mrs. B.

00:07.784 --> 00:09.352
Thanks. I love this holiday.

00:09.386 --> 00:11.187
It is so spooky.

00:11.220 --> 00:13.956
Um, hey, could one of you

00:13.990 --> 00:16.859
grab my mug
out of the microwave?

00:16.893 --> 00:19.729
Yeah.
I'll get it.

00:19.762 --> 00:21.731
Kyle, you're gonna open the door
and whatever creature

00:21.764 --> 00:24.100
was on sale at Halloween Town
is gonna be in there.

00:24.133 --> 00:25.402
Probably a rat.

00:25.435 --> 00:27.304
What? No.

00:27.337 --> 00:29.171
Oh!

00:31.808 --> 00:33.543
Sorry.

00:33.576 --> 00:36.446
I was expecting a rat.

00:36.479 --> 00:39.282
I love you, Mom, but
your Halloween pranks are lame.

00:39.316 --> 00:42.151
Lame? There's a head
in the microwave.

00:42.184 --> 00:45.322
Yeah, see? Some people
appreciate a good prank.

00:45.355 --> 00:46.956
Oh, well, Kyle's easy.

00:46.989 --> 00:49.292
Almost as easy as you.
You fall for everything.

00:49.326 --> 00:50.993
No, I don't.
G-Give me one example.

00:51.027 --> 00:52.194
-Boo!
-(screams)

00:54.263 --> 00:58.167
You know what? That is not
a prank, that is just rude.

00:58.200 --> 01:00.269
But stick around,
this might be the year

01:00.303 --> 01:03.272
I pull off
the greatest prank ever.

01:03.306 --> 01:05.808
Oh, we can't.
We're taking Kristin and Ryan

01:05.842 --> 01:08.745
to the creepy abandoned trailer
Kyle inherited from his mom.

01:08.778 --> 01:11.614
-We're having a séance.
-Yeah.

01:11.648 --> 01:15.017
I just hope we don't
conjure up my mom.

01:15.051 --> 01:18.655
Even as a ghost, she'll probably
still ask for beer money.

01:19.956 --> 01:21.524
Fine, well,
it'll just be me tonight,

01:21.558 --> 01:24.126
-home alone, handing out candy.
-Yeah, yeah.

01:24.160 --> 01:26.463
Always starts with candy.
Then they'll expect

01:26.496 --> 01:29.632
money, jobs, health care.
Sure.

01:29.666 --> 01:32.535
Trick-or-treating:
the gateway drug to socialism.

01:34.170 --> 01:36.172
Yeah, you said the same thing
about Santa Claus.

01:36.205 --> 01:38.675
You called him
the welfare king of the north.

01:38.708 --> 01:41.644
Specifically, the Santa
at the mall. The real Santa

01:41.678 --> 01:43.680
makes you work for it
with naughty and nice lists.

01:43.713 --> 01:47.350
I know about this.
Don't ask me how.

01:47.384 --> 01:48.385
I can't believe
you are abandoning me

01:48.418 --> 01:50.286
on my favorite holiday.

01:50.319 --> 01:52.121
Honey, I told you this. We're
testing the security system.

01:52.154 --> 01:53.490
Tonight's the perfect night,
'cause no one's

01:53.523 --> 01:54.891
-gonna be at the store.
-All right, Kyle,

01:54.924 --> 01:56.959
let's go.
We got a séance to host.

01:56.993 --> 01:59.496
You know, if we could
talk to anybody who's dead,

01:59.529 --> 02:02.865
-I'd pick Pee-wee Herman.
-What?

02:02.899 --> 02:05.402
Babe, he's not dead.

02:05.435 --> 02:06.636
Oh.

02:06.669 --> 02:09.972
Well, he is awfully pale.

02:10.006 --> 02:13.142
-(laughs)
-Look, I know you want me home

02:13.175 --> 02:15.344
because you want to prank me,
but, honey, I got to admit,

02:15.378 --> 02:17.514
your pranks just aren't working
anymore, okay?

02:17.547 --> 02:19.816
Mm, yeah, you're right,
you're right. Why do I even try?

02:19.849 --> 02:21.651
Hey, uh...

02:21.684 --> 02:24.387
could you get my mug
out of the microwave?

02:29.058 --> 02:31.093
Okay.

02:32.194 --> 02:33.630
Ooh.

02:38.601 --> 02:40.603
*

02:45.742 --> 02:47.677
Hey, Mike Baxter here
for Outdoor Man.

02:47.710 --> 02:50.279
In America, our calendar
is marked by special days.

02:50.312 --> 02:53.616
Um... the day we celebrate
our freedom, July Fourth.

02:53.650 --> 02:55.718
The day we express
our gratitude, Thanksgiving.

02:55.752 --> 02:58.455
And there's the day we all
get the crap scared out of us

02:58.488 --> 03:01.591
by bloodsucking vampires,
Tax Day.

03:02.959 --> 03:04.861
Of course,
Halloween can also be scary.

03:04.894 --> 03:06.463
In fact, many of us--

03:06.496 --> 03:10.032
it taps into our deepest,
deepest, darkest fears:

03:10.066 --> 03:13.570
other people's children
coming to our house.

03:13.603 --> 03:16.639
If you're like me,
you'd actually prefer zombies.

03:16.673 --> 03:18.741
As a culture, we've always
loved scaring each other.

03:18.775 --> 03:20.376
We build elaborate
haunted houses.

03:20.409 --> 03:22.044
And how do we know
that they're working?

03:22.078 --> 03:23.980
(laughing):
We make little kids cry.

03:24.013 --> 03:25.582
What a country.

03:25.615 --> 03:27.249
That's right, we try
to convince our children

03:27.283 --> 03:29.752
the world is a safe place,
and once a year we scream,

03:29.786 --> 03:33.089
"No, it's not! Boo!"

03:33.122 --> 03:36.258
On Halloween, our nation
abandons the war on terror

03:36.292 --> 03:38.427
to wage a war of terror

03:38.461 --> 03:40.730
on our loved ones.

03:40.763 --> 03:42.565
For some reason,
there's nothing better

03:42.599 --> 03:44.767
than seeing those
nearest and dearest to us

03:44.801 --> 03:46.168
standing in a puddle of...

03:46.202 --> 03:48.771
of what we hope are tears.

03:48.805 --> 03:50.673
Of course, this year's
most terrifying haunted house

03:50.707 --> 03:52.742
won't open till
a week after Halloween.

03:52.775 --> 03:55.144
It's called the
House of Representatives.

03:56.212 --> 03:57.480
(sighs)

03:57.514 --> 03:59.148
Baxter out.

04:02.184 --> 04:03.853
Got to hand it to you, Mandy--

04:03.886 --> 04:06.956
you picked the perfect place
to host a séance.

04:06.989 --> 04:09.659
-Or contract hepatitis.
-We have to

04:09.692 --> 04:11.794
untether our spirits
from this plane,

04:11.828 --> 04:14.531
so everyone
must empty their minds.

04:14.564 --> 04:16.132
Done.

04:16.165 --> 04:18.367
You bring the candles?

04:18.400 --> 04:22.004
Oh, yeah, brought
the, uh, Bernie Sanders.

04:22.038 --> 04:24.340
Keep the flame alive.

04:24.373 --> 04:26.375
I'm so glad you agreed
to join us, hon.

04:26.408 --> 04:29.045
I know you had your heart
set on Halloween trivia night.

04:29.078 --> 04:31.814
Yeah, it's okay. I've actually,
uh, never done a séance.

04:31.848 --> 04:35.317
You know, the word "séance"
is French for "session."

04:35.351 --> 04:38.154
Five points for Vogelson.

04:38.187 --> 04:41.290
There's a little preview
of the bullet you dodged.

04:41.323 --> 04:43.359
Oh, I dodged a bullet once.

04:43.392 --> 04:45.828
See?

04:45.862 --> 04:48.798
Shh! Everyone take a seat.

04:48.831 --> 04:51.200
Prepare to summon the spirit

04:51.233 --> 04:53.402
of the great Angelo Santucci.

04:53.435 --> 04:54.837
The great who?

04:54.871 --> 04:56.472
He was an Italian
fashion designer

04:56.505 --> 04:58.474
famous for his all-white suits.

04:58.507 --> 05:00.543
He died in an avalanche
in the Alps.

05:00.577 --> 05:02.712
He was very hard to find.

05:02.745 --> 05:04.747
That's one case where
a pair of black socks

05:04.781 --> 05:06.849
could've saved a life.

05:06.883 --> 05:08.718
You know, the Alps
are the highest mountain range

05:08.751 --> 05:11.821
in Europe. Their world ranking,
though? Number 11.

05:11.854 --> 05:14.757
Another five points and
a commanding lead for Vogelson.

05:16.192 --> 05:17.694
Let's join hands.

05:20.462 --> 05:21.698
Oh, spirit world.

05:21.731 --> 05:23.399
We humbly ask you
to bring forward

05:23.432 --> 05:25.367
the spirit of Angelo Santucci.

05:25.401 --> 05:27.670
Or Patrick Swayze.

05:27.704 --> 05:30.172
If the spirit world
is open to this invitation,

05:30.206 --> 05:32.942
reveal unto us a sign.

05:32.975 --> 05:34.977
(siren chirps)

05:38.815 --> 05:41.584
Uh, if this is a sign,
it's a bad one.

05:45.588 --> 05:47.624
All right,
all the monitors check out.

05:47.657 --> 05:49.892
Thanks for coming up here
to help, Baxter.

05:49.926 --> 05:51.628
It's fine with me.
I like this stuff, you know,

05:51.661 --> 05:53.462
I'm a techie guy.

05:53.495 --> 05:56.465
Now, I was worried it was just
because you wanted to prank me,

05:56.498 --> 05:58.534
it being Halloween and all.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.569
Well... I only
prank people I like.

06:00.603 --> 06:02.939
Oh.

06:02.972 --> 06:05.942
Oh, that's right.
So, in that case...

06:05.975 --> 06:08.911
I guess I wasted 20 bucks.

06:08.945 --> 06:11.380
It's hard to tell
which is which.

06:11.413 --> 06:12.882
(laughs)

06:12.915 --> 06:16.285
Hey, hey, Baxter,
I thought we were alone.

06:16.318 --> 06:17.820
There's something
moving down there

06:17.854 --> 06:19.789
and it's coming up the stairs.

06:19.822 --> 06:22.625
Ooh! Didn't we just agree we
weren't gonna prank each other?

06:22.659 --> 06:25.594
-No, no, no, no, no. It's not
a prank. Whatever it is,
-Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah.

06:25.628 --> 06:28.631
-it's big and it's got
a giant head.
-Whoa.

06:28.665 --> 06:30.499
-Hey, guys, what's up?
-Whoa, whoa.

06:30.532 --> 06:32.669
What are you doing here, Joe?
Everybody else left

06:32.702 --> 06:34.436
to be home with their families
hours ago.

06:34.470 --> 06:36.172
I'm not going home.
I hate Halloween.

06:36.205 --> 06:38.074
-Really? I love it.
-Yeah,

06:38.107 --> 06:40.242
-you know who else loves it?
-Uh, kids?

06:40.276 --> 06:42.344
Satan.
No, I'm serious, okay?

06:42.378 --> 06:44.313
Demon and hellspawn
get to freely roam the earth

06:44.346 --> 06:46.282
one night a year,
and I'm supposed to, what,

06:46.315 --> 06:48.851
open the door
and give them a bonbon?

06:48.885 --> 06:50.352
If you don't want demons
at your door,

06:50.386 --> 06:51.821
don't give 'em the good stuff.

06:51.854 --> 06:55.257
I'm telling you,
Satan hates candy corn.

06:55.291 --> 06:56.859
You know, I hope you're still
laughing when you have

06:56.893 --> 06:59.862
a flaming pitchfork
in your ass, okay?

06:59.896 --> 07:01.998
Look, I'll be in the garage.
I'm working on my car.

07:02.031 --> 07:04.033
Y-You're gonna feel safe
all alone down there?

07:04.066 --> 07:06.435
Oh, yeah, I'm packing.

07:06.468 --> 07:08.871
I got a squirt gun
filled with holy water.

07:13.542 --> 07:14.944
(chuckles)

07:14.977 --> 07:17.046
Phew.

07:17.079 --> 07:20.349
You know, when we said we
weren't gonna prank each other,

07:20.382 --> 07:22.084
we just meant you and I, right?

07:24.153 --> 07:26.388
Oh, yeah.

07:38.034 --> 07:39.235
Hey, Joe.

07:39.268 --> 07:41.370
Freeze, demons!

07:41.403 --> 07:44.006
Are you guys insane?
I almost blasted you!

07:44.040 --> 07:46.408
Yeah, we're lucky.
We almost got wet.

07:46.442 --> 07:48.410
Yeah, go ahead, make your jokes,
have your fun.

07:48.444 --> 07:50.146
Hey, we're not here to make fun
of you, Joe. We're here

07:50.179 --> 07:51.680
to tell you something
very important.

07:51.714 --> 07:53.349
What's that?

07:53.382 --> 07:54.650
-We get it, all right?
-Yeah.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.385
We were just
goofing around upstairs

07:56.418 --> 07:58.220
'cause we wanted to make sure
that you were serious

07:58.254 --> 08:00.823
-about what you said
about Halloween.
-And, obviously, you are.

08:00.857 --> 08:02.825
I mean, it's-it's creepy, right?

08:02.859 --> 08:04.827
Worse than creepy, man--
it's dark, it's evil,

08:04.861 --> 08:07.029
it's like voodoo or-or kale.

08:08.397 --> 08:09.866
It's actually the reason
why Chuck and I

08:09.899 --> 08:11.600
-are here tonight.
-Mm-hmm.

08:11.633 --> 08:13.736
I thought you were down here
putting in motion detectors.

08:13.770 --> 08:16.739
Motion detectors? We... I don't
think this is a good idea.

08:16.773 --> 08:18.941
You know, I trust him, and-and
we're gonna need his help.

08:18.975 --> 08:20.109
You're gonna tell him the whole
story? He's not gonna believe

08:20.142 --> 08:22.578
-this whole story. Just...
-I got to try, Mike.

08:24.413 --> 08:27.283
Listen, Joe.

08:27.316 --> 08:30.419
This store was built
on what was, many years ago,

08:30.452 --> 08:32.354
an old insane asylum.

08:32.388 --> 08:35.057
Oh, please, and what was that
called, The Outdoor Loony Bin?

08:35.091 --> 08:36.926
I told you he wasn't gonna
believe this. Never mind, Joe.

08:36.959 --> 08:39.261
-Let's just
handle this ourselves.
-Okay.

08:42.098 --> 08:44.433
All right, okay,
hang on, hang on.

08:46.502 --> 08:49.806
Let's say there's something
to this whole...

08:49.839 --> 08:52.141
nuthouse story.

08:52.174 --> 08:55.044
100 years ago,

08:55.077 --> 08:57.246
on this very night,
on Halloween,

08:57.279 --> 08:59.648
a madman bound with chains
was brought in.

08:59.681 --> 09:03.085
A madman who claimed
to be a prince.

09:03.119 --> 09:05.454
Yeah.

09:05.487 --> 09:07.123
A prince.
And when they asked him,

09:07.156 --> 09:08.724
"What-what country
are you prince of?"

09:08.757 --> 09:12.628
his-his reply was,
"A kingdom is not a country."

09:12.661 --> 09:15.431
'Cause he claimed
to be the prince...

09:15.464 --> 09:18.968
Of darkness?

09:19.001 --> 09:22.604
-The man...
-Or whatever he was.

09:22.638 --> 09:25.641
...was locked in the deepest,
darkest cell of the asylum.

09:25.674 --> 09:29.511
Everyone was terrified to open
that door again, so they didn't.

09:29.545 --> 09:32.014
Ever.

09:32.048 --> 09:34.616
And that door is in the basement
of Outdoor Man.

09:34.650 --> 09:36.652
Every Halloween, Mike and I
close the store early

09:36.685 --> 09:39.021
so we can make sure
that door stays sealed.

09:39.055 --> 09:40.990
Why do you need my help?

09:42.558 --> 09:45.862
Well, according to my demonic
motion detector...

09:45.895 --> 09:48.464
There's an app for that?

09:48.497 --> 09:50.666
Whatever's behind that door

09:50.699 --> 09:53.202
is trying to get out.

09:56.672 --> 09:58.707
VANESSA:
Wow!

09:58.740 --> 10:02.011
Happy Halloween!
Gosh, I love your costumes.

10:02.044 --> 10:03.712
Here, anybody else
want a toothbrush?

10:03.745 --> 10:06.883
Right? No, no, it's candy.
It's... Come on, it's candy.

10:06.916 --> 10:09.351
All right, well, seriously,
brush afterwards.

10:09.385 --> 10:11.320
Oh, my! Wow.

10:11.353 --> 10:13.055
Look at you.
You're very scary.

10:13.089 --> 10:14.723
Can I have extra? The police
blocked off the street

10:14.756 --> 10:16.358
down at the Kirkpatricks' house.

10:16.392 --> 10:19.161
What? No, my grandson's
at a sleepover there.

10:19.195 --> 10:21.030
-Here, take this. I got to go...
-Got you, Grandma!

10:21.063 --> 10:23.365
Aunt Mandy said
you're easy to prank.

10:23.399 --> 10:26.702
I am not easy to prank!

10:26.735 --> 10:29.371
Oh, wait a minute, where's
the bowl? Where's the-the...

10:29.405 --> 10:33.342
Boyd! You!
I know where you live!

10:36.112 --> 10:37.546
Here she comes.

10:40.249 --> 10:43.352
Uh, happy Halloween, Officer.

10:43.385 --> 10:45.854
What are you folks
doing on this property?

10:45.888 --> 10:47.523
Uh, we're having a séance.

10:47.556 --> 10:49.191
You're aware
that you're trespassing?

10:49.225 --> 10:51.827
Actually, uh, we're not.
This is his trailer.

10:51.860 --> 10:54.396
Yeah, it used to belong
to my mom, Judith Anderson.

10:54.430 --> 10:55.998
You may have met her.

10:56.032 --> 10:58.700
She spent a lot of time
with your organization.

10:58.734 --> 11:00.669
Is there a problem, Officer?
I happen to know

11:00.702 --> 11:02.038
a lot about citizens' rights.

11:02.071 --> 11:05.341
I'm a, uh, marijuana dealer.

11:05.374 --> 11:08.077
I'll need to see
everyone's I.D.s.

11:08.110 --> 11:10.947
Oh, funny thing. Uh, we had
to leave our wallets and phones

11:10.980 --> 11:12.748
in Kyle's van,
because apparently,

11:12.781 --> 11:15.952
they "interfere with the
spiritual gateway." (chuckles)

11:15.985 --> 11:18.387
You know what, I'll just run
to the van and get the I.D.s.

11:18.420 --> 11:20.089
If you're talking about the van
on the frontage road,

11:20.122 --> 11:21.423
we just towed it.

11:21.457 --> 11:23.392
It was parked
in front of a hydrant.

11:23.425 --> 11:26.395
That was a hydrant?
It was wearing a witch's hat.

11:26.428 --> 11:28.130
Still a hydrant.

11:28.164 --> 11:31.300
If you don't have I.D.s,
I have to take you all in.

11:31.333 --> 11:34.036
(laughs)
Wait a minute.

11:34.070 --> 11:35.637
This isn't real.

11:35.671 --> 11:37.639
I told Mom that she was
terrible at pranks,

11:37.673 --> 11:40.809
and all of a sudden, we're gonna
be taken in by a "lady cop"?

11:40.842 --> 11:42.144
(laughs)

11:42.178 --> 11:44.880
Mom's totally trying
to up her game.

11:44.913 --> 11:48.084
Yeah. Hey, aren't you
in Mrs. B's book club?

11:48.117 --> 11:51.453
The one who reads the least,
but drinks the most?

11:53.489 --> 11:56.292
-Guys, I think she might
be a real cop.
-I am.

11:56.325 --> 11:59.461
-Yeah, her squad car
certainly looks real.
-It is.

11:59.495 --> 12:02.898
-Are we going for a ride?
-You are.

12:02.931 --> 12:05.501
You're about to be a part
of a whole different book club.

12:05.534 --> 12:07.536
Come on, now.

12:16.145 --> 12:18.247
Oh, the door's already open!

12:18.280 --> 12:20.282
I thought this was
just a storage room.

12:20.316 --> 12:22.284
I didn't realize
it was the gateway to hell.

12:22.318 --> 12:25.787
-You should've
put up a sign or something.
-It can't be obvious,

12:25.821 --> 12:28.424
otherwise his acolytes
would know where to find him.

12:28.457 --> 12:31.093
Oh, yeah,
that makes sense, yeah.

12:31.127 --> 12:32.694
Did you hear that?

12:32.728 --> 12:35.264
It just got colder.

12:35.297 --> 12:37.166
Can you not say it that way,
with the deep voice?

12:37.199 --> 12:39.168
It just makes everything
sound scarier.

12:39.201 --> 12:40.502
Yeah, it's like
we're fighting evil

12:40.536 --> 12:43.139
-with Barry White.
-Yeah.

12:43.172 --> 12:45.807
I've been talking like this
since I was 11.

12:47.209 --> 12:49.611
Early puberty.

12:49.645 --> 12:51.313
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:51.347 --> 12:52.948
-Think I'm getting a reading,
right there, right there.
-Okay.

12:52.981 --> 12:54.950
It's hot! W-What do we do,
what do we do, what do we do?

12:54.983 --> 12:56.818
Look, I'm not going
near that door, okay?

12:56.852 --> 13:00.389
I'll see the devil on the day
I die, and-and not a day before.

13:00.422 --> 13:03.025
We have a responsibility.

13:03.059 --> 13:05.394
We're the last line of defense
between this abomination

13:05.427 --> 13:06.995
and the rest of humanity.

13:07.029 --> 13:09.798
Who knows what darkness
lies behind that door?

13:09.831 --> 13:11.667
Joe, you go in.

13:11.700 --> 13:14.036
Didn't you just hear me say...
(stammers) the day I die?

13:14.070 --> 13:16.038
I'll go.
This is the day

13:16.072 --> 13:18.240
I've been training for
my whole life.

13:19.841 --> 13:20.909
Wish me luck.

13:20.942 --> 13:22.244
Chuck.

13:22.278 --> 13:25.081
You're gonna need
more than luck.

13:25.114 --> 13:26.948
You're gonna need this.

13:28.016 --> 13:29.051
Thanks, Joe.

13:34.256 --> 13:37.025
Take it easy, take it easy.
Quiet.

13:39.695 --> 13:41.597
(grunting)

13:41.630 --> 13:43.599
Mike, it's got me!

13:43.632 --> 13:45.834
Oh, my God, he's being dragged
to the bowels of hell!

13:45.867 --> 13:47.836
No, no, we can't...
you can't save him.

13:47.869 --> 13:49.738
-Not today, Satan!
-We got to save ourselves!

13:49.771 --> 13:52.441
(screaming)

13:55.477 --> 13:57.446
(laughing)

13:57.479 --> 13:58.980
We got you, man.

14:01.317 --> 14:03.452
MIKE: Oh, that's great.
Oh, that's a great prank,

14:03.485 --> 14:05.354
man, it's... Oh, it's...
oh, it was just me

14:05.387 --> 14:07.856
trying to scare you, man. Take
it easy, breathe a little bit.

14:07.889 --> 14:09.958
-I got a pain in my arm, man.
-What?

14:09.991 --> 14:11.993
I got a pain in my ar...

14:20.302 --> 14:23.105
Joe, Joe, Joe. I-I... I think
the dude had a heart attack.

14:23.139 --> 14:25.307
-Well, give him CPR.
-He's not even breathing.

14:25.341 --> 14:27.443
-Well, give him mouth-to-mouth.
-I don't want to.

14:27.476 --> 14:29.278
Man, get out of the way.

14:29.311 --> 14:31.213
The man is dying.

14:31.247 --> 14:33.115
Okay, Joe. I got you, man.

14:33.149 --> 14:35.451
You might want
to try a breath mint.

14:35.484 --> 14:36.785
(laughs)

14:42.758 --> 14:45.093
And that is how you do a prank!

14:45.127 --> 14:46.728
-Yeah!
-Yes!

14:46.762 --> 14:48.930
Wh... You... you set me up?

14:48.964 --> 14:50.766
That's right, I set you up
by having you think

14:50.799 --> 14:52.301
we were setting him up.

14:52.334 --> 14:53.935
In your face.

14:55.504 --> 14:56.805
An insane asylum.

14:56.838 --> 14:59.107
How dumb do you
think I am? (laughs)

14:59.141 --> 15:01.843
Apparently not as dumb
as Mike thinks I am.

15:01.877 --> 15:05.414
It's not about which one of you
is dumber, it's how smart I am.

15:05.447 --> 15:08.150
Man, this is low, Baxter,
even for you.

15:08.184 --> 15:11.019
-Oh, when I...
when you go low, I go lower.
-(laughs)

15:11.052 --> 15:13.355
I can't believe
you thought this was funny.

15:13.389 --> 15:16.024
Uh, I didn't. He's my bo...
I-I just went along.

15:16.057 --> 15:18.760
(scoffs) You know what?
I'm leaving, you guys.

15:18.794 --> 15:21.297
-Just enjoy the rest
of your Halloween.
-Oh, come on. (chuckles)

15:22.331 --> 15:23.665
He seemed upset.

15:23.699 --> 15:25.033
Eh, I'd be upset, too--
he almost

15:25.066 --> 15:27.068
kissed an old Italian woman.

15:30.806 --> 15:33.842
Wow, nice costume.

15:33.875 --> 15:36.512
But aren't you a little old
to be trick-or-treating?

15:36.545 --> 15:37.979
Here.

15:38.013 --> 15:40.816
Why does everyone
think this is a costume?

15:40.849 --> 15:43.785
Ma'am, I picked up
four individuals tonight

15:43.819 --> 15:46.121
who were trespassing
in an abandoned trailer.

15:46.154 --> 15:48.990
Mm-hmm.

15:49.024 --> 15:51.460
Does a Kyle Anderson live here?

15:51.493 --> 15:55.163
Oh, I don't know that name.

15:55.197 --> 15:58.133
Then why are you smiling?

15:58.166 --> 16:01.203
I just love Halloween.

16:01.237 --> 16:04.005
Anyway, Mr. Anderson's
in my squad car.

16:04.039 --> 16:07.476
He's the one happily
waving at us.

16:07.509 --> 16:10.246
Says he and his wife live here,
and that the deed to the trailer

16:10.279 --> 16:13.014
is inside, which would prove
they weren't trespassing.

16:13.048 --> 16:14.216
Is this true?

16:14.250 --> 16:17.219
No.

16:17.253 --> 16:19.087
And you can tell whoever's
in that car

16:19.120 --> 16:20.922
that I'm not falling
for their trick.

16:20.956 --> 16:23.225
They must have me mistaken
for someone

16:23.259 --> 16:25.861
who is easy to prank.

16:25.894 --> 16:28.397
Are you sure
you don't know them?

16:28.430 --> 16:30.599
It seems like you do.

16:30.632 --> 16:32.568
(laughs)

16:32.601 --> 16:35.371
I'm sure.
Look, are we done here?

16:35.404 --> 16:36.772
Because it's Halloween,

16:36.805 --> 16:39.508
and I have a lot
of work to do, "Officer."

16:39.541 --> 16:41.076
(laughs)

16:41.109 --> 16:43.545
I hate this holiday.

16:46.782 --> 16:48.917
What do you want, Baxter?

16:48.950 --> 16:51.186
You're not answering
my phone calls, man.

16:51.219 --> 16:53.922
Whatever.
If you came over to apologize,

16:53.955 --> 16:55.924
you're wasting your time.

16:55.957 --> 16:59.861
I'm not wasting my time,
'cause I'm not apologizing.

16:59.895 --> 17:01.963
You're being a big crybaby.
You're sucking all the joy

17:01.997 --> 17:04.366
-out of Halloween.
-(scoffs) You're incredible.

17:04.400 --> 17:07.235
I think I'm pretty
incredible, too.

17:07.269 --> 17:09.638
Took me a week to figure that
out. And it was pretty funny

17:09.671 --> 17:11.139
when you thought
we were pranking Joe.

17:11.172 --> 17:13.241
-That's different.
-Why is that different?

17:13.275 --> 17:16.978
Y-You were willing to let me
think I'd killed a man.

17:17.012 --> 17:19.281
Not killed.
Massive heart attack.

17:22.318 --> 17:25.053
That's a huge thing
to lay on a person, man.

17:25.086 --> 17:26.254
You crossed a line.

17:26.288 --> 17:27.956
Stop being so sensitive.
In a week,

17:27.989 --> 17:29.958
we'll both be laughing at it.
At least, I will be.

17:31.360 --> 17:32.794
Are we good?

17:32.828 --> 17:34.563
I guess I have to be.

17:34.596 --> 17:36.465
-Why do you have to be?
-'Cause you're my boss.

17:36.498 --> 17:37.499
-Oh, stop it.
-Oh, no, no.

17:37.533 --> 17:39.401
Whatever you do,
I just have to take it.

17:39.435 --> 17:41.603
Oh, call HR.

17:43.038 --> 17:44.506
You only got to do
what I got to do.

17:44.540 --> 17:46.408
I mean, we hang out
when we're not at work.

17:46.442 --> 17:48.310
Oh, oh, oh, oh--
so you're-you're saying

17:48.344 --> 17:51.680
we're friends, right?
That-that you like me?

17:53.882 --> 17:56.518
You... y-you shouldn't

17:56.552 --> 17:59.154
put words in people's mouths.

17:59.187 --> 18:00.956
Good-bye, Baxter.

18:00.989 --> 18:02.424
(stammers): W-Wait a minute,
you mean I can't leave here

18:02.458 --> 18:04.793
until I-I, I say
w-what you said?

18:04.826 --> 18:06.362
That's right.

18:06.395 --> 18:10.131
And remember, I'm sensitive.

18:10.165 --> 18:12.133
Okay, you know what,
there's-there's a lot of d-days,

18:12.167 --> 18:13.769
-you come to work...
-Mm-hmm.

18:13.802 --> 18:15.837
...and I like it when
you're there, even though

18:15.871 --> 18:18.306
you don't bring doughnuts.
Right?

18:18.340 --> 18:19.808
So that would prove

18:19.841 --> 18:22.578
that we're f-friend... ly.

18:24.145 --> 18:26.047
Friendly?

18:26.081 --> 18:28.149
All right, we're friends.

18:28.183 --> 18:29.985
Can I go now?

18:30.018 --> 18:32.220
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, hang on, hang on.

18:32.253 --> 18:33.855
What level of friends are we?

18:33.889 --> 18:36.157
-No, no, no... Come on.
-No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

18:36.191 --> 18:38.293
Are we acquaintance friends,
good friends?

18:38.326 --> 18:39.495
'Cause we're gonna
have to be pretty close

18:39.528 --> 18:41.397
for me to get over this.

18:41.430 --> 18:43.365
-Okay.
-Hmm.

18:43.399 --> 18:46.234
But if I hear you say anything
to anybody about this,

18:46.267 --> 18:48.203
I will kick you
in the Barry Whites.

18:52.708 --> 18:54.009
We...

18:54.042 --> 18:57.513
You're one of my best friends.

18:57.546 --> 19:00.181
Oh. How about that?

19:00.215 --> 19:03.652
-Mike Baxter, man of stone...
-Yeah, yeah.

19:03.685 --> 19:07.255
...is a mushball.
(chuckles)

19:07.288 --> 19:09.791
I didn't think we'd ever
get you to say that.

19:11.059 --> 19:12.528
Wh... W-Why did you say "we"?

19:12.561 --> 19:14.530
Yes!

19:14.563 --> 19:16.364
(laughing)

19:20.301 --> 19:22.103
Yes!

19:22.137 --> 19:23.905
Best prank ever!

19:25.040 --> 19:26.408
And I was the mastermind.

19:26.442 --> 19:30.211
Oh, yeah. Me.
Yeah, in your face.

19:31.813 --> 19:34.583
-Wait a minute. You did this?
-No, we did it.

19:34.616 --> 19:37.419
Last week, I heard you on
the phone with Joe setting up

19:37.453 --> 19:40.689
your fake prank on him, so you
could actually prank Chuck.

19:40.722 --> 19:44.760
So then I called Chuck to set up
this real prank on you.

19:46.227 --> 19:47.463
Yeah, that's right.
That's right.

19:47.496 --> 19:51.199
I am the prank queen!

19:51.232 --> 19:52.768
(laughs)

19:52.801 --> 19:55.270
It was genius, because
what is the scariest thing

19:55.303 --> 19:56.538
to Mike Baxter?

19:56.572 --> 19:59.040
-Human emotion.
-Human emotion.

19:59.074 --> 20:02.277
-Yes!
-(laughs)

20:02.310 --> 20:04.613
-Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank you. Yes, thank you.
-Oh, thank you.

20:04.646 --> 20:07.415
-Yeah, see, I'm not clapping for
you guys, I'm clapping for me.
-CHUCK: What?

20:07.449 --> 20:09.384
'Cause I think this
is a really big deal for me.

20:09.417 --> 20:12.287
-What?
-I did good work here.
I took a great woman--

20:12.320 --> 20:14.289
kind, big-hearted--
added a little evil.

20:14.322 --> 20:16.291
This might be some
of my best work.

20:16.324 --> 20:18.494
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

20:18.527 --> 20:20.228
No, no.
You can't take credit for this.

20:20.261 --> 20:22.598
This is mine.

20:22.631 --> 20:23.665
Is it?

20:25.534 --> 20:28.737
What if it isn't done yet?

20:28.770 --> 20:30.606
What do you mean, not done yet?
What does that mean?

20:30.639 --> 20:32.373
Tell her, Chuck.

20:34.442 --> 20:36.177
Tell her what?

20:36.211 --> 20:38.413
Come on.
You can tell her.

20:38.446 --> 20:40.749
-What?
-What do you want
to tell me, Chuck?

20:40.782 --> 20:42.751
(stammers)

20:42.784 --> 20:45.854
I think it's gonna
take a while to sort this out.

20:45.887 --> 20:48.189
I'm gonna go have a cold beer.

20:54.329 --> 20:56.331
Hey.

20:56.364 --> 21:00.135
How long were you and Larabee
yelling at each other?

21:00.168 --> 21:03.138
Shut up, Mike.
I got you good,

21:03.171 --> 21:04.806
-and you can't
take that away from me.
-You're right,

21:04.840 --> 21:06.174
-you did, you did.
-Yes.

21:06.207 --> 21:07.509
You know what
that means, though.

21:07.543 --> 21:09.277
Next year, I'm gonna just...

21:09.310 --> 21:12.180
well, let's just
wait till next year.

21:12.213 --> 21:14.449
Well, you better make it
a good one, because my days

21:14.482 --> 21:16.484
-of falling for pranks are over.
-Is that right?

21:16.518 --> 21:19.120
Yeah, you should've seen the one
the kids tried to pull on me.

21:19.154 --> 21:20.822
-What did the kids
try to pull on you?
-I don't know,

21:20.856 --> 21:22.558
it was a...
something to do with a fake cop.

21:22.591 --> 21:24.192
Tell you in the morning.

21:31.700 --> 21:34.402
Oh, wait-- I do have my I.D.

21:37.005 --> 21:38.473
(chicken clucks)
