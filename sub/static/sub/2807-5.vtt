00:02.669 --> 00:05.587
Okay, this one's rare.
This one is medium well. Go!

00:05.755 --> 00:07.715
- Hey, Phoebe! How was dinner?
- Hey!

00:07.882 --> 00:10.467
Dinner was good! Just saying hi!
Now I'm gonna go!

00:10.635 --> 00:12.386
All right, okay.

00:12.554 --> 00:15.973
- Oh. Well, hello there.
- Hi.

00:16.140 --> 00:18.767
I didn't see this on the menu.

00:18.935 --> 00:21.228
Phoebe, this is Tim, my new sous chef.

00:21.396 --> 00:24.732
- Oh. So you're Monica's boss?
- Actually, she's my boss.

00:24.899 --> 00:29.445
- "Sous" is French for "under."
- Ah! I "sous-stand." Heh.

00:29.612 --> 00:33.032
Tim, I need a calamari and a caesar salad.
And could you get me the pesto?

00:33.199 --> 00:35.200
- Yeah.
- You made pesto?

00:35.368 --> 00:36.577
Yes, I did.

00:36.745 --> 00:39.872
Would you say your pesto
is the best-o? Heh.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.624
I don't know.
I would say it's pretty good-o.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.047
I still need the calamari and the salad.

00:48.214 --> 00:50.382
- I like your necklace.
- Oh, I made it myself.

00:50.550 --> 00:53.844
- You are so talented.
- Well, it's no pesto.

00:55.305 --> 00:58.932
All right, let's just cut to the chase.
Okay? You're single, you're single.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.977
He gets off work at 11.
She'll be waiting for your call.

01:02.145 --> 01:07.483
I'll give him your number if I could
just get calamari and caesar salad!

01:09.069 --> 01:11.904
I did not yell.
I am not putting a dollar in the jar.

01:55.115 --> 01:59.952
- Wow, Bing! Burning the midnight oil.
- You know me, sir.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.789
Oh, I have a question. Do you know how
can I get around the computer network...

02:03.957 --> 02:06.917
...so I can access
the really good Internet porn?

02:08.294 --> 02:10.336
You're a joker, Bing.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.466
What's funny about that?

02:14.843 --> 02:18.470
- Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
- That's okay. Where do you wanna go?

02:18.638 --> 02:21.640
Oh, uh, I think you know
where I wanna go.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.393
- The Hard Rock Cafe?
- Yeah.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.186
- Again?
- Yeah.

02:28.314 --> 02:32.693
- I'm telling you, I like the food.
- You like the Purple Rain display.

02:34.362 --> 02:37.698
- Hey, Bob.
- Hey, Toby. Have a good night.

02:38.533 --> 02:43.579
- Did that guy just call you Toby?
- Yeah, he thinks that's my name.

02:44.372 --> 02:48.709
- Why don't you correct him?
- Oh, it's been way too long now.

02:48.960 --> 02:52.296
The first time, we were passing each other
so I didn't say anything.

02:52.463 --> 02:55.883
The next time he said,
"Hey, Toby, want a doughnut?"

02:56.050 --> 02:59.386
And I wanted the doughnut.

02:59.554 --> 03:03.515
Five years later, the doughnut's gone
and I'm still Toby.

03:03.683 --> 03:07.853
- Five years? Chandler, you have to tell him.
- No, that would be so awkward.

03:08.021 --> 03:11.148
Besides, we work in different departments.
He's on the sixth floor.

03:11.316 --> 03:14.443
So he calls me Toby once in a while.
Big deal. Could be worse.

03:14.611 --> 03:17.446
It's not like he's calling me Muriel.

03:17.697 --> 03:21.783
Muriel.
Why would he call you Muriel?

03:25.788 --> 03:26.997
Oh, my God.

03:28.917 --> 03:31.460
Chandler M. Bing.

03:33.671 --> 03:37.257
It's not just an M.
Your middle name is Muriel!

03:37.425 --> 03:40.552
Shh! It is a family name.

03:41.512 --> 03:45.390
Chandler Muriel Bing.

03:45.558 --> 03:48.018
Your parents never even
gave you a chance, did they?

03:51.272 --> 03:54.441
Drake, I've discovered the reason
for your headaches and memory loss.

03:54.609 --> 03:55.692
What is it?

03:55.860 --> 03:59.071
Apparently, your brain transplant
was not entirely successful.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.907
It seems your body
is rejecting Jessica's brain.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.326
Is it serious?

04:04.494 --> 04:06.995
Not if we extract tissue
from the original body...

04:07.163 --> 04:09.915
...synthesize antibodies,
introduce them into your system...

04:10.083 --> 04:13.085
...which could stop you
from rejecting the brain.

04:13.253 --> 04:16.964
That sounds simple enough.
Let's just do that.

04:17.130 --> 04:20.968
We would, but when we went
to exhume Jessica's body...

04:21.135 --> 04:23.553
...it was gone.

04:26.307 --> 04:29.142
Cut. Very nice, people.

04:29.310 --> 04:31.687
- Let me change and we can go to dinner.
- Wh...? Oh.

04:31.854 --> 04:36.316
- What happened to Jessica's body?
- I'm not telling. You'll have to see it on TV.

04:36.484 --> 04:39.486
- You don't know, do you?
- No. Couldn't care less.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.656
- Hey, good scene, man. All right.
- You too.

04:46.452 --> 04:49.204
- What? You weren't in it.
- Oh...

04:50.164 --> 04:54.251
Oh, sorry. Uh, Kash,
this is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash.

04:54.419 --> 04:57.421
- Hi.
- How come I haven't seen you here before?

04:57.588 --> 05:01.258
Well, heh. Joey probably
just thinks I'll embarrass him.

05:01.426 --> 05:04.678
He thinks I'm some kind
of soap opera nut. Ha-ha-ha.

05:04.846 --> 05:07.306
Which I'm not. I'm not. Ha, ha.

05:07.473 --> 05:11.310
Although, I do know your favorite
ice cream flavor is butter pecan.

05:12.854 --> 05:16.064
And, uh... And your dog's name is Wally.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.944
- Look at that, I'm just stroking your arm.
- Here we go.

05:21.112 --> 05:24.114
We're leaving. Bye, Kash.
Say hi to Wally.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.620
- Oh, Monica.
- Hi.

05:30.788 --> 05:35.751
Oh, my God, I had the best time
with Tim last night. He is so sweet.

05:35.918 --> 05:38.462
Ugh! I can't wait to get "sous-neath" him.

05:39.797 --> 05:42.591
- Uh, I... I have to fire him.
- Why?

05:42.759 --> 05:46.178
Because He's terrible.
He's slow. He burns things.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.972
Last night he lit my pastry chef on fire.

05:49.140 --> 05:52.517
He was nervous.
You can be very intimidating.

05:52.685 --> 05:56.521
And I've met your pastry chef.
She can stand to be taken down a peg.

05:56.689 --> 06:00.067
Well, now she has no eyebrows.
Mission accomplished.

06:00.818 --> 06:04.029
But Monica, he loves his job so much.

06:04.197 --> 06:07.157
Can't you just give him
another chance, please?

06:09.327 --> 06:12.496
All right. But if he lights someone
else on fire, he is out of there.

06:12.663 --> 06:16.750
That's fair. Thank you so much. Thanks.

06:17.418 --> 06:20.921
Oops, looks like when he got the pastry
chef, he got you a little bit too.

06:21.089 --> 06:23.548
I paid to have this done.

06:26.010 --> 06:28.053
Love it!

06:31.057 --> 06:32.432
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.060
Oh, you know, uh,
Kash really liked you the other day.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.437
- He said he thought you were charming.
- Ha!

06:37.605 --> 06:40.857
- I thought I was an idiot.
- I'm with you.

06:42.693 --> 06:45.570
- He asked if you'd go out with him.
- Oh!

06:45.822 --> 06:48.198
Oh, I think I'm gonna throw up a little.

06:48.366 --> 06:50.575
- What did you say?
- I said, "No." Heh.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.536
What?

06:52.745 --> 06:56.706
I figured since you're pregnant,
you're not gonna be seeing people.

06:56.874 --> 06:58.750
Okay, Joey.

06:58.918 --> 07:03.505
First of all, Kash Ford? Not people.

07:03.673 --> 07:06.383
Second, what did he say
when you told him I was pregnant?

07:06.551 --> 07:09.219
I didn't. I didn't know
if you were telling people.

07:09.387 --> 07:12.431
This was back when I thought Kash
was still "people."

07:12.598 --> 07:16.393
- Good. Don't. Just have him call me.
- I really don't think that's such...

07:16.561 --> 07:18.728
Okay, you go do it.
I'll come back to that set.

07:18.896 --> 07:21.273
- I'll meet more actors. I'll meet them all.
- Yup.

07:23.484 --> 07:26.736
- Hey, Bob.
- Hey! How's my pal Toby doing today?

07:26.904 --> 07:29.364
- If I see him, I'll ask.
- Aah!

07:32.785 --> 07:36.496
Hey, Bing. Was that Bob from six
you were just talking to?

07:36.664 --> 07:38.498
- Yeah.
- You know each other?

07:38.666 --> 07:41.126
We're on a semi-first-name basis.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.837
What do you think
of adding him to our team?

07:44.005 --> 07:46.131
Bob? Ooh.

07:46.382 --> 07:48.884
Working here with us? Every day?

07:49.051 --> 07:51.761
Yeah, I don't know if he has what it takes.

07:51.929 --> 07:55.807
- Really? They love him down on six.
- But this is 11.

07:56.601 --> 07:59.019
It's almost twice as hard up here.

07:59.937 --> 08:01.438
Okay, I hear you loud and clear.

08:01.606 --> 08:04.024
- Bob will stay put.
- I think it's best, sir.

08:04.192 --> 08:07.903
We really do need to find somebody.
Work is starting to pile up.

08:08.070 --> 08:11.156
I've got a stack of documents on my desk
this high.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.492
What you should do,
toss them in the shredder...

08:13.659 --> 08:15.202
...and claim you never got them.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.997
That's a good one, Bing.

08:19.499 --> 08:24.044
What does a guy have to do
to be taken seriously around here?

08:28.216 --> 08:30.091
- Hey.
- Okay, I gave him another chance...

08:30.259 --> 08:31.927
...but Tim has got to go.
- But...

08:32.094 --> 08:34.136
No! No, no. He's totally incompetent.

08:34.304 --> 08:36.472
I called the chef
who recommended him to me.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.017
He said, "Ha, ha! Gotcha!"

08:40.186 --> 08:42.979
- Okay, but you can't fire him today.
- Why not?

08:43.147 --> 08:47.108
- Because I'm dumping him today.
- What? You said he was sweet.

08:47.276 --> 08:51.238
He is sweet. He's too sweet.
He calls me all the time.

08:51.405 --> 08:54.950
"Did you get home from work okay?
Did you get out of the shower okay?"

08:55.117 --> 08:57.994
- Just don't pick up your phone.
- Then he comes over!

08:58.162 --> 09:01.414
"I was worried about you."
Ugh, be a man!

09:02.083 --> 09:04.000
So now I'm not allowed to fire him?

09:04.168 --> 09:07.504
You can't fire him and dump him
in the same day. He'll kill himself.

09:07.672 --> 09:10.131
I fire him today,
you go out with him another week.

09:10.299 --> 09:14.219
Are you kidding? Another week
with that simp, I'll kill myself.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.639
Then we'll both do it today
and he'll just have to deal with it.

09:18.391 --> 09:21.101
Okay. But the question is,
who's gonna go first?

09:21.269 --> 09:23.311
Whoever goes second is the bitch.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.565
- What do you mean?
- The boss that fires a guy...

09:26.732 --> 09:28.608
...that's just been dumped? Bitch!

09:28.776 --> 09:31.444
And the woman who dumps a guy
that's just been fired?

09:31.612 --> 09:33.530
Blond bitch!

09:33.698 --> 09:36.324
I wanted to do this days ago,
so I think I should go first.

09:37.827 --> 09:40.161
Ugh. All right, that makes sense.

09:40.329 --> 09:41.997
Agh, but...

09:42.164 --> 09:45.000
...screw you! I'm going first!

09:49.422 --> 09:51.798
- Hey, Toby, you got a sec?
- Sure, what's up?

09:51.966 --> 09:55.218
I just had a meeting.
I was hoping to get transferred up here.

09:55.386 --> 09:57.178
But I found out it's not gonna happen.

09:57.346 --> 10:01.474
Apparently somebody thinks
I'm not "11 th-floor material."

10:01.976 --> 10:05.020
Say, uh, who the hell is this Chandler?

10:07.857 --> 10:11.526
What do you think is the better excuse
for why I'm not drinking on this date?

10:11.694 --> 10:15.196
Um, "I'm a recovering alcoholic,"
"I'm a Mormon"...

10:15.364 --> 10:18.950
...or "I got so hammered last night
I'm still a little drunk"?

10:20.077 --> 10:21.202
- Hey.
- Hi.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.913
So, what do you want to do tonight?

10:24.081 --> 10:27.626
There's a Ukrainian film at the Angelika
that's supposed to be very powerful.

10:27.793 --> 10:29.753
- Interested?
- No. No.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.881
But I'll go see
a normal-person movie with you.

10:33.049 --> 10:36.593
- Rach, you wanna come?
- Oh, no, I can't. I got a date.

10:37.136 --> 10:41.056
- Heh. A date?
- Yeah. Why, is that weird for you?

10:41.223 --> 10:46.144
Why, no. It's the opposite of weird.
It's, uh... It's regular. It's, uh...

10:46.312 --> 10:50.440
It's mundane. It's actually a little dull.

10:50.608 --> 10:53.526
It's no Ukrainian film, I'll tell you.

10:53.694 --> 10:55.904
Ooh! Earrings!

10:56.614 --> 11:02.410
- A date? She's got a date? With who?
- I set her up with this actor on my show.

11:02.578 --> 11:06.456
- You set her up?
- No.

11:07.458 --> 11:10.543
- Joey, what were you thinking?
- That it would probably be okay...

11:10.711 --> 11:13.755
...because Ross hasn't gone out
with Rachel in five years.

11:13.923 --> 11:16.883
Joey, I'm not worried about her.
I'm worried about my baby.

11:17.051 --> 11:19.636
Whoever she dates, my baby dates.

11:19.804 --> 11:24.432
- Where is this "actor" taking them?
- Hey! I'm an "actor" too.

11:26.811 --> 11:30.814
I'm not sure. I think they're taking the ferry
to some Italian place on Staten Island.

11:30.981 --> 11:34.693
A ferry? My baby's going on a ferry?

11:34.860 --> 11:37.195
Do you have any idea
how dangerous those are?

11:37.363 --> 11:41.533
Aren't we talking about those big boats
that go, like, five miles an hour?

11:41.701 --> 11:44.619
Why don't they just jump out
of an airplane? That's a fun date.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.621
Or burn each other with matches?
That's fun too.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.164
Whoo!

11:51.669 --> 11:53.002
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Kash.

11:53.170 --> 11:55.422
- Uh, hey, Ross, this is Kash.
- Hey.

11:55.589 --> 11:58.967
- Hey, I hear you're going on a ferry tonight.
- Yeah.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.469
Bit of a daredevil, are we?

12:02.972 --> 12:06.141
Hey, you guys, do you think
this is too slutty? Hi, Kash.

12:06.851 --> 12:10.395
- Hey, Rachel. You ready to go?
- Yeah. See you guys later.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.690
- Okay. Have a great time, you guys.
- Thank you.

12:13.858 --> 12:16.609
And yes, it is too slutty!

12:23.826 --> 12:25.785
- Hi.
- Ah!

12:26.328 --> 12:27.412
Hi.

12:27.580 --> 12:31.040
I'm so glad you called.
I feel like it's always me calling you.

12:31.208 --> 12:34.878
So, what's up?
Is everything okay with Phoebe?

12:36.213 --> 12:39.674
It will be in a minute. Listen.

12:39.842 --> 12:43.344
- Tim, you're a really great guy.
- That's because I'm with you.

12:43.512 --> 12:45.305
Aw.

12:48.100 --> 12:51.436
I'm just... I'm in a place in my life
right now where I...

12:53.189 --> 12:55.273
Whoops! So sorry. "This just in." Heh.

12:57.651 --> 13:00.361
It's 911 from the restaurant.
That means Monica needs me.

13:00.529 --> 13:03.072
Oh, no, she doesn't! I know what that is.
You can stay.

13:03.282 --> 13:04.741
Aw...

13:04.909 --> 13:07.285
I'll miss you too, Pheebs.

13:07.953 --> 13:12.290
And I will be holding you right here.

13:20.132 --> 13:23.468
So, what movie do you wanna see?
And not another one I have to read.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.553
I get enough of that from books.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.850
- Books?
- All right, car magazines, cereal boxes...

13:31.018 --> 13:32.644
...but it's, like, enough!

13:33.562 --> 13:35.230
I tell you what, why don't we...?

13:35.397 --> 13:38.066
Why don't we stay. Let's not see a movie.
We'll just hang.

13:38.234 --> 13:41.110
Just wait for Rachel
to come back from her date?

13:41.278 --> 13:44.614
Hey, if that's what you wanna do,
I'm not gonna say no.

13:44.824 --> 13:47.534
Dude, what is going on?

13:47.701 --> 13:51.162
- I just... I have to find out how it went.
- Why?

13:51.330 --> 13:53.414
This guy could be my baby's stepfather.

13:53.582 --> 13:56.626
They go on one date and you're worried
about them getting married?

13:56.794 --> 13:59.003
He's not you.

13:59.755 --> 14:03.216
I just, I can't believe she's dating.

14:03.384 --> 14:07.262
- What did you think she was gonna do?
- I don't know.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.723
I guess I can't believe
any of this is happening.

14:11.433 --> 14:12.600
What do you mean?

14:12.768 --> 14:15.770
I always thought when I had another kid,
it'd be different.

14:17.773 --> 14:23.069
I love Ben. But every time
I drop him off at Carol and Susan's...

14:23.237 --> 14:26.531
...it breaks my heart a little.

14:27.199 --> 14:31.661
I've always had this picture
of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday.

14:31.829 --> 14:36.833
My kid comes running in, leaps up on
the bed and we all read the paper together.

14:37.001 --> 14:41.129
You know?
Maybe fight over the science section.

14:41.797 --> 14:44.340
That's a nice picture.
Maybe you can still have that.

14:44.508 --> 14:48.177
No, I can't. Rachel's out with some guy.

14:48.345 --> 14:50.722
My baby went with her.

14:52.182 --> 14:55.894
If anything, that picture
keeps moving further away.

14:57.479 --> 14:59.647
Hey, can I ask you something?

14:59.815 --> 15:06.029
In this picture of you and your wife,
is your wife Rachel?

15:06.864 --> 15:08.781
It used to be.

15:10.284 --> 15:13.411
Now she doesn't really have a face.

15:14.663 --> 15:17.373
Smoking body, though.

15:18.959 --> 15:24.130
Good call. But the face, Ross,
the face isn't Rachel.

15:24.298 --> 15:28.426
No. But, ugh, how much easier
would it be if it were?

15:28.594 --> 15:30.762
I know, but I don't think
that's what she wants.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.263
It's not what I want either.

15:32.431 --> 15:35.016
And I can't force myself
to fall in love with her again.

15:35.184 --> 15:38.019
Ross, maybe you need a new picture.

15:38.187 --> 15:42.982
Okay? It's not gonna be what you thought.
But no matter what...

15:43.150 --> 15:46.945
...there's gonna be
a brand-new little baby. Your baby.

15:47.905 --> 15:50.657
Who cares what the picture looks like?

15:51.742 --> 15:53.409
Yeah.

15:54.328 --> 15:57.372
Hey, tell you what. Let's you and me
go out and have some fun.

15:57.539 --> 16:00.249
Huh? Whatever you want. Come on.

16:01.377 --> 16:04.712
- We can catch that Ukrainian film.
- No, I said fun.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.425
- Hey, Toby?
- Hey, Bobby.

16:09.885 --> 16:11.052
It's Bob, actually.

16:13.347 --> 16:17.225
You work up here. Can you tell me
where Chandler Bing's office is?

16:17.393 --> 16:21.854
Uh, yeah, it's right...

16:23.273 --> 16:25.942
Right there.
Let me ask you, why?

16:26.110 --> 16:28.945
Ha, ha, I wanna talk to that bastard,
see what his problem is.

16:29.113 --> 16:31.197
Okay, Bob, listen. Uh...

16:32.491 --> 16:35.410
I'm the reason you didn't get the job.

16:35.577 --> 16:37.495
- Toby, don't.
- Bob.

16:37.663 --> 16:42.166
Toby, I'm not gonna let you
cover for him.

16:42.334 --> 16:45.920
Anything you say will just get me
more upset with Chandler.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.590
Well that puts me in a difficult position.

16:53.053 --> 16:56.597
- I got your page. Is everything okay?
- Uh, well, that depends.

16:56.765 --> 17:00.643
- How are things with Phoebe?
- It's great. Thank you for introducing us.

17:00.811 --> 17:05.064
Oh, my pleasure. Okay,
I'm afraid I've got some bad news.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.151
- Phoebe!
- Monica!

17:09.653 --> 17:11.654
- I'm breaking up with you!
- You're fired!

17:11.821 --> 17:14.656
- What?
- I'm breaking up with you.

17:14.825 --> 17:18.118
- You're fired.
- Why?

17:18.287 --> 17:22.540
I'm sorry. I'm not ready
for a relationship right now.

17:22.708 --> 17:27.211
And I'm sorry too. But, well,
I like things done a certain way.

17:27.378 --> 17:32.675
- And the chemistry's just not right.
- Ooh, good. The chemistry thing for us too.

17:34.219 --> 17:38.264
Wow, heh. Um, okay. Um...

17:39.266 --> 17:41.684
I realize I came on a little strong.

17:41.852 --> 17:44.437
But it's only because
I think you're so amazing.

17:45.481 --> 17:46.731
And, uh...

17:47.232 --> 17:51.027
I just wanna tell you how much I appreciate
you giving me an opportunity here...

17:51.195 --> 17:54.530
...because you're the most talented chef
I've ever worked for.

17:56.283 --> 17:58.201
Anyway, heh.

18:04.041 --> 18:07.335
- Tim, wait. Wait. Um...
- Yeah?

18:08.295 --> 18:12.965
I think I spoke too quickly.
There's a learning curve with this job.

18:13.133 --> 18:15.760
- Maybe we could try it again.
- Really?

18:15.928 --> 18:17.011
Thank you so much.

18:17.179 --> 18:19.138
- Because I know I can be better.
- Okay.

18:21.350 --> 18:25.019
And Tim, I just want to say
good luck here.

18:32.736 --> 18:34.987
- Hello. Ha, ha.
- Hi.

18:35.155 --> 18:36.948
Uh, how was the date?

18:37.116 --> 18:43.329
Well, I'm alone and I just bought $15
worth of candy bars. What do you think?

18:43.497 --> 18:45.748
- Huh. What happened?
- Made the mistake...

18:45.916 --> 18:48.126
...of telling him that I was pregnant.

18:48.293 --> 18:52.547
- He didn't, uh, take it so well?
- Well, better than you.

18:53.257 --> 18:56.467
- But still not what you want.
- Oh?

18:56.635 --> 19:00.304
Yeah. He got all weird and sputtery.
Then he said, uh:

19:00.472 --> 19:03.474
"I hear those hemorrhoids
are a bitch."

19:04.017 --> 19:06.644
- He sounds swell.
- Doesn't he?

19:07.563 --> 19:09.522
Hey, you want a little cheering up?

19:09.690 --> 19:12.066
- Yes. Okay.
- Sit down.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.778
Guess whose middle name is Muriel?

19:20.450 --> 19:22.410
- Chandler M. Bing.
- Yu-huh.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.412
Oh, my God.

19:28.792 --> 19:31.878
- I'm sorry about your date.
- It's all right.

19:32.129 --> 19:35.256
I guess I'm just done
with the whole dating thing.

19:35.799 --> 19:40.261
Just one more thing in my life
that is suddenly completely different.

19:40.512 --> 19:43.931
- This is hard.
- Yeah, I know.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.686
On the other hand, in, um...

19:48.854 --> 19:52.523
In about seven months
you're gonna have something...

19:52.691 --> 19:57.278
...that you're gonna love more than
any guy you've ever gone out with.

19:59.489 --> 20:02.366
Just wait. Wait until, uh...

20:02.910 --> 20:06.454
Wait until the first time
your baby grabs your finger.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.123
You have no idea.

20:11.501 --> 20:14.003
Thanks, sweetie.

20:17.841 --> 20:23.638
- You wanna grab some coffee?
- No. I'm gonna go eat 10 candy bars.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.848
- I thought I cheered you up.
- Oh, you did.

20:26.016 --> 20:28.601
- There are 20 in here.
- Right.

20:29.519 --> 20:31.938
- Good night.
- Good night.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.404
- Ross?
- Yeah?

20:40.572 --> 20:43.074
Hey, it's Mona. From the wedding.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.826
- Oh, hi!
- Hi.

20:45.994 --> 20:47.203
Wow, uh...

20:47.371 --> 20:49.497
- How are you?
- I'm good, except, um...

20:49.665 --> 20:51.290
...you still owe me a dance.

20:51.458 --> 20:52.959
- Oh, that's right.
- Mm.

20:53.126 --> 20:56.170
Well, uh, would you be interested
in seeing a Ukrainian film?

20:58.465 --> 21:00.383
Oh, you're serious. Sure.

21:01.885 --> 21:04.178
Great. Well, uh...

21:05.180 --> 21:07.390
I think I might need
one more cup of coffee.

21:07.557 --> 21:10.726
- Sure, uh, let me get it for you.
- Okay.

21:28.578 --> 21:31.163
Bob? Bob!

21:31.581 --> 21:32.832
Bob!

21:33.917 --> 21:38.587
- What the hell are you doing?
- I just found out this is Chandler's office.

21:38.755 --> 21:40.673
Come on, Toby. Give me a hand!
