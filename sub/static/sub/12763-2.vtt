00:01.000 --> 00:03.663
<i>Previously on Kyle XY:</i>

00:03.737 --> 00:07.104
So let me understand.
The boy has no family that you know of,

00:07.173 --> 00:10.040
he doesn't communicate
and was found wandering alone.

00:10.110 --> 00:13.273
But there is one more thing
you should see.

00:13.346 --> 00:14.313
No belly button.

00:14.414 --> 00:17.383
I have a new patient,
and where he's staying isn't safe,

00:17.450 --> 00:19.680
so I'm bringing him here
for a little while.

00:19.753 --> 00:22.278
Some mental patient's
going to live in our house?

00:22.355 --> 00:24.289
He's a very sweet, very special boy.

00:24.357 --> 00:28.191
- I don't want him touching my things.
- If your mom says he's coming, he is.

00:28.261 --> 00:30.695
Juice me.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.732
Did he just learn to talk in one day?

00:32.832 --> 00:34.527
No. Lori, that's impossible.

00:34.601 --> 00:36.364
That was an hour-long test.

00:36.469 --> 00:40.030
- How long did it take, five minutes?
- Yeah. And he got them all right!

00:40.607 --> 00:42.734
What is this kid, seriously?

00:44.878 --> 00:47.403
Somebody
has to be missing this kid.

00:47.480 --> 00:50.176
So far
no one's filed a report.

00:50.250 --> 00:54.016
I was hoping you wouldn't mind
if Kyle stayed with us a while longer.

01:31.324 --> 01:33.189
<i>They called it sleep.</i>

01:34.060 --> 01:37.393
<i>A strange state after dark
during which they did nothing...</i>

01:41.201 --> 01:42.930
<i>...thought nothing...</i>

01:47.006 --> 01:49.873
<i>...but made odd noises
and sometimes spoke.</i>

01:49.943 --> 01:51.171
Run!

01:55.048 --> 01:57.346
<i>How could they just lie there all night?</i>

01:57.417 --> 01:59.942
<i>There was so much to learn and explore.</i>

02:07.293 --> 02:09.454
<i>I didn't know where to begin.</i>

02:25.812 --> 02:28.747
<i>Every taste and texture
made my senses explode.</i>

04:56.362 --> 04:59.092
<i>- It's 4:00 in the morning.
- It seemed to matter,</i>

04:59.165 --> 05:00.496
<i>what this number was.</i>

05:00.566 --> 05:03.126
- What were you thinking?
- He didn't know better.

05:03.236 --> 05:04.794
Was he raised by wolves?

05:04.904 --> 05:06.838
No, apparently by Chinese people.

05:06.906 --> 05:10.467
OK, enough. It's late.
Let's finish this up in the morning.

05:10.543 --> 05:12.443
Kyle, you must be exhausted.

05:12.512 --> 05:14.844
When did you wake up?

05:14.914 --> 05:16.279
I didn't wake up.

05:18.051 --> 05:20.315
Have you been having trouble sleeping?

05:21.020 --> 05:22.988
I don't sleep.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.683
You mean, not tonight?

05:25.558 --> 05:26.684
I mean, not ever.

05:26.759 --> 05:29.057
You've been
with us for over a week.

05:29.128 --> 05:32.393
You're telling us you haven't slept,
not even once?

05:32.465 --> 05:34.330
Never.

05:43.276 --> 05:44.573
- Hi, hon.
- Hey.

05:45.878 --> 05:47.505
I only have an hour.

05:47.580 --> 05:50.549
<i>Those numbers.
They planned everything around them.</i>

05:50.616 --> 05:54.712
- How about you? You have to go in?
- No. I took time off to be with Kyle.

05:54.787 --> 05:57.153
<i>The numbers represented time,</i>

05:57.223 --> 05:59.885
<i>which they never seemed
to have enough of.</i>

05:59.959 --> 06:02.928
So I'll tell you why Kyle
hasn't slept for ten days.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.657
- He's an alien.
- He's not an alien.

06:06.799 --> 06:09.495
I've never seen him sleep
and his bed is next to mine.

06:09.569 --> 06:11.127
You fall asleep before he does.

06:11.237 --> 06:14.172
Save the imagination for summer school,
which reminds me,

06:14.240 --> 06:16.401
no Xbox until you
finish those assignments.

06:16.476 --> 06:18.103
- I'm gone.
- No breakfast?

06:18.177 --> 06:19.337
No time.

06:20.413 --> 06:23.974
<i>How could she not have any?
It seemed to be all they talked about.</i>

06:24.851 --> 06:27.911
Mom, there's a detective
here to see you.

06:27.987 --> 06:29.420
Kyle,

06:30.757 --> 06:33.851
you said the last thing you remember
is being in the woods.

06:33.926 --> 06:35.894
Now, how did you get there?

06:37.730 --> 06:39.425
I don't know.

06:40.032 --> 06:42.967
Do you remember why
you weren't wearing clothes?

06:48.975 --> 06:51.102
I don't remember ever having any.

06:54.947 --> 06:57.211
OK, um, how old are you?

07:03.156 --> 07:06.319
We don't know.
We're guessing around 16.

07:08.461 --> 07:10.588
Where did you live before here?

07:11.731 --> 07:13.426
Nowhere.

07:16.936 --> 07:18.460
I'm sorry.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.664
I just don't remember.

07:22.475 --> 07:24.340
It's OK, Kyle.

07:25.344 --> 07:26.902
You will.

07:27.980 --> 07:30.312
I wish I could report more progress,

07:30.383 --> 07:34.843
but no one's filed a missing person's
report that fits Kyle's description.

07:34.921 --> 07:36.946
No one noticed he's gone?

07:37.023 --> 07:40.083
How could that be?
He has to have come from somewhere.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.118
Someone has to be missing him.

07:42.228 --> 07:44.389
Maybe he left a bad situation at home.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.125
You think Kyle's a runaway?

07:46.999 --> 07:49.627
Or something terrible
could have happened to him.

07:49.702 --> 07:51.602
I've seen it in my practice,

07:51.671 --> 07:55.698
patients with amnesia caused by
some traumatic experience.

07:55.775 --> 07:59.336
I've seen people with amnesia too,
but never to this degree.

08:00.880 --> 08:03.440
I've never seen anyone like Kyle before.

08:07.620 --> 08:09.918
It was madness
at my house last night.

08:09.989 --> 08:12.150
Captain Clueless ate half our kitchen.

08:12.225 --> 08:15.353
Kyle? I wouldn't mind feasting on him.
That boy's a hottie.

08:18.030 --> 08:18.997
There's Declan.

08:19.098 --> 08:21.259
Can't believe he hasn't called.

08:21.367 --> 08:23.335
Hilary, he can do what he wants.

08:23.903 --> 08:25.393
So can I.

08:32.010 --> 08:33.910
- Yo, Hills.
- Hey there.

08:34.914 --> 08:37.144
Trager, I haven't seen you around.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.014
Been busy.

08:40.086 --> 08:41.553
No time for me anymore?

08:42.221 --> 08:44.485
I might be able
to fit you into my schedule.

08:45.224 --> 08:47.556
As long as you ditch the skank.

08:47.627 --> 08:49.993
We saw you mauling that nympho
at your party.

08:50.062 --> 08:52.587
She was mauling me.
I couldn't shake her.

08:53.599 --> 08:55.863
Besides, you took off with that guy.

08:56.602 --> 08:59.867
- What guy?
- The kung fu master.

08:59.939 --> 09:02.772
The dude who broke my window
then messed with the cop.

09:02.842 --> 09:04.366
- You mean...
- Kyle!

09:04.443 --> 09:08.106
The way he scooped her up
and carried her off...

09:08.180 --> 09:10.444
Isn't he incredible?

09:12.218 --> 09:14.345
Let him chew on that for a little while.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.790
Hi. Nicole Trager.

09:19.859 --> 09:21.554
We're here to see Dr. Stone.

09:24.063 --> 09:27.191
Nicole, all you've written down here
is "Kyle".

09:27.266 --> 09:30.724
His name is the only thing we know
about him and even that we made up.

09:30.803 --> 09:33.101
No memory, no medical history?

09:33.172 --> 09:35.140
No, he's like a 16-year-old newborn.

09:35.942 --> 09:39.434
With a newborn we know the
parents and have a genetic history.

09:39.512 --> 09:41.446
So where do we start?

09:41.514 --> 09:42.879
Let me see the films.

09:49.889 --> 09:52.323
They said the MRI machine was broken.

09:54.760 --> 09:58.252
It had to be. Nobody could produce
that much brain activity.

10:01.267 --> 10:04.031
He does have
an extraordinary aptitude for math.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.468
It's not possible.

10:05.571 --> 10:08.904
Even a genius IQ would not show
half those results.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.515
<i>I had no idea
what he was looking for...</i>

10:22.955 --> 10:24.115
Good.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.853
Kyle, open.

10:27.493 --> 10:28.460
Aah.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.995
<i>...or why he thought he'd find it
in my mouth.</i>

10:33.165 --> 10:34.826
<i>Maybe it was in his.</i>

10:37.003 --> 10:39.369
I'm not a dentist,
but are these veneers?

10:39.472 --> 10:42.339
His teeth don't look worn at all.
They look brand new.

10:42.408 --> 10:45.104
He didn't know what a toothbrush was
until I showed him.

10:45.177 --> 10:46.940
Lay back, Kyle.

10:53.686 --> 10:55.176
You tell me.

10:57.690 --> 11:00.659
I've never seen anything like it.

11:00.726 --> 11:03.092
Clearly a genetic anomaly.

11:03.162 --> 11:05.926
<i>- I knew something was missing...
- Skin graft?</i>

11:05.998 --> 11:08.865
<i>- ... but I didn't know why it mattered.
- What for?</i>

11:08.934 --> 11:10.458
And no trace of a scar?

11:11.671 --> 11:14.936
Perhaps surgery to correct
an umbilical hernia?

11:15.007 --> 11:18.374
Dr. Stone, I don't think they'd wipe out
the whole navel.

11:34.727 --> 11:38.390
Some of his characteristics
are unusual,

11:39.231 --> 11:41.563
but he's in excellent shape, physically.

11:41.634 --> 11:44.398
Obviously, his mental health
is cause for concern.

11:44.503 --> 11:46.471
I'll be working to recover his memory,

11:46.539 --> 11:49.201
but now I'm more worried
that he's not sleeping.

11:49.275 --> 11:52.802
Well, if I didn't know who I was,
I'd have trouble sleeping too.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.607
But he must be sleeping, Nicole.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.375
He looks fine, not tired at all.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.610
But he says he hasn't slept in ten days.

11:58.684 --> 12:00.777
Not once, and I've never
seen him asleep.

12:10.763 --> 12:13.926
Give him one of these.

12:14.867 --> 12:17.233
Guaranteed to give him
a good night's sleep.

12:17.303 --> 12:19.430
And don't worry, Nicole.

12:19.505 --> 12:21.996
Normal people can't go long
without sleeping.

12:22.074 --> 12:24.042
And you think Kyle is normal?

12:25.044 --> 12:27.205
No belly button aside,

12:27.780 --> 12:30.078
heart rate's good,
blood pressure's fine.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.848
Just like any other kid his age.

12:33.919 --> 12:36.479
Oh, my.
How did he do that?

12:41.627 --> 12:43.686
- Oh, my.
- Did you see that?

12:45.364 --> 12:47.628
Great!

13:01.180 --> 13:04.547
I think I've got it.
What if time is different

13:04.617 --> 13:06.175
on Kyle's home planet?

13:06.285 --> 13:09.015
Josh, this is Kyle's home planet.

13:09.088 --> 13:11.989
One earth day might be, like,
an hour for him.

13:12.057 --> 13:13.615
So ten days...

13:13.692 --> 13:15.990
Is like ten hours.
Yeah, I get it.

13:16.061 --> 13:18.723
- You're being ridiculous.
- Think about it.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.699
He's this super brain with amnesia.

13:22.234 --> 13:24.327
He can't understand the simplest things,

13:24.403 --> 13:26.837
but does calculus
like it's two plus two.

13:26.906 --> 13:29.397
He barely knows
what you're saying sometimes,

13:29.475 --> 13:31.841
but somehow speaks Chinese.

13:31.944 --> 13:35.505
He never sleeps and I haven't
gotten to the belly button thing yet.

13:35.581 --> 13:38.516
Mom, I'm telling you, Kyle is not human.

13:42.621 --> 13:44.282
Oh, Kyle.

13:44.356 --> 13:46.324
Of course you're human.

13:46.392 --> 13:48.121
See? Even he's not sure.

13:48.194 --> 13:50.685
Stop wasting time.
Go do your homework.

13:50.763 --> 13:52.390
That's a waste of time.

13:52.464 --> 13:54.489
<i>I didn't know
time could be wasted.</i>

13:58.270 --> 14:03.230
Kyle, I want you to try something.
Sometimes people have trouble sleeping

14:03.342 --> 14:07.608
because they're concerned about
something that's happened to them.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.012
- Am I?
- I'm not sure.

14:10.082 --> 14:12.812
But this might help you recall
some experiences.

14:13.752 --> 14:16.585
I want you to draw anything,
anything at all.

14:16.655 --> 14:19.419
Anything you can remember
about where you came from.

14:20.292 --> 14:22.055
About your home.

14:36.842 --> 14:38.366
Great.

14:39.411 --> 14:41.845
Even if it doesn't make any sense
to you now.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.857
Kyle's still at it.
He's been drawing for hours.

14:51.924 --> 14:53.892
Good. Wear him out.

14:53.959 --> 14:55.893
The way he draws...

14:55.961 --> 14:59.522
It's almost like he snaps a picture
in his head and then reproduces it.

15:00.332 --> 15:02.459
It's the same sort of thing
over and over.

15:02.534 --> 15:05.901
This must be the place near Victor Falls
where he was first seen.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.104
His earliest memory.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.108
What do you think it means?

15:12.177 --> 15:15.146
I think something significant
may have happened there,

15:15.214 --> 15:16.704
but he can't explain it yet.

15:35.668 --> 15:39.229
Chamomile always does the trick for me.
It's very soothing.

15:39.338 --> 15:41.806
It's gonna help you sleep.

15:41.874 --> 15:44.035
- Tastes like horse pee.
- Josh!

15:44.109 --> 15:46.634
- It does.
- What does horse pee taste like?

15:47.713 --> 15:50.147
- How would I know?
- You just said...

15:50.215 --> 15:52.308
It's just an expression.
A rude one.

15:53.652 --> 15:55.552
Here, Kyle.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.384
Try the tea.

15:57.489 --> 15:59.354
It's hot, though.
Be careful.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.164
No, not the tea bag.

16:06.999 --> 16:08.694
The water.
You drink the tea.

16:12.504 --> 16:14.233
- Alien.
- What are you doing?

16:14.306 --> 16:16.240
Eats tea bag.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.809
I'm keeping a list.
What makes Kyle an alien.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.751
- It's good?
- It's good.

16:34.426 --> 16:36.485
Now I'm the tea bag.

16:39.965 --> 16:41.933
<i>Somehow I felt safe here.</i>

16:42.601 --> 16:43.761
<i>Secure.</i>

16:43.836 --> 16:45.701
<i>At peace.</i>

16:49.208 --> 16:50.903
He loves it under there.

16:50.976 --> 16:53.501
'Cause he's weightless,
like in space.

16:53.579 --> 16:55.547
- Out.
- I'm right.

16:55.647 --> 16:57.808
See? He's still under.

17:00.819 --> 17:02.309
Kyle.

17:09.895 --> 17:10.987
Relaxed?

17:11.563 --> 17:13.087
One of us is.

17:29.982 --> 17:33.611
<i>So, what's up for tonight?
Hitting the town with Mr. Kung Fu?</i>

17:33.685 --> 17:35.050
Nope. Just hangin'.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.856
<i>Maybe I'll swing by later.</i>

17:38.490 --> 17:40.321
Maybe I'll be around.

17:40.392 --> 17:41.916
Hold on.

17:42.628 --> 17:44.596
Kyle, do you mind?

17:48.901 --> 17:50.391
Sorry.

17:50.469 --> 17:52.369
<i>...future today.</i>

17:52.438 --> 17:57.137
<i>Madacorp, on the web
at M-A-D-A-C-O-R-P dot com.</i>

18:10.989 --> 18:13.719
Likes white noise.

18:13.792 --> 18:15.225
Check.

18:17.129 --> 18:19.290
Dude, you'll never sleep with that on.

18:24.703 --> 18:26.637
Yo, hands off the stash!

18:27.139 --> 18:29.164
My Sour Patch Kids are sacred.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.211
I can't wait to fall asleep.

18:34.279 --> 18:37.715
<i>Last night the entire Sports Illustrated
swimsuit issue came to life.</i>

18:37.783 --> 18:39.842
Just me and seven supermodels.

18:41.186 --> 18:42.744
I am so primed for the sequel.

18:42.821 --> 18:43.788
OK, Kyle.

18:43.889 --> 18:46.050
Well, you've had a bath, some warm tea.

18:46.725 --> 18:48.693
- Feeling tired?
- No.

18:49.895 --> 18:52.420
I'm sure part of the problem
is you're anxious.

18:52.498 --> 18:55.797
Remember, Detective Breen and the police
are still searching.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.699
They're looking for answers.

18:57.769 --> 19:01.830
In the meantime, you've got
to get some sleep and this will help.

19:01.907 --> 19:03.135
Will you take it?

19:17.055 --> 19:18.818
I took it.

19:20.192 --> 19:22.456
No. You have to...
You have to swallow it.

19:23.295 --> 19:25.195
And then I'll sleep?

19:34.339 --> 19:36.102
- Good.
- Perfect.

19:36.708 --> 19:38.073
Good night, boys.

19:41.413 --> 19:43.381
- Sleep well.
- Sweet dreams.

19:44.783 --> 19:46.808
Oh, they will be.

20:17.115 --> 20:20.278
<i>He looked so pleased,
stretched out, doing nothing.</i>

20:22.454 --> 20:25.821
<i>But I still felt like the whole world
was calling out to me,</i>

20:25.924 --> 20:27.789
<i>waiting to be explored.</i>

20:41.373 --> 20:45.332
<i>I learned it was wrong to touch things
in the house while they were sleeping.</i>

20:46.445 --> 20:49.937
<i>So... I went outside.</i>

22:17.469 --> 22:18.834
Wow.

22:28.680 --> 22:31.444
How did you do that?
You're like the Dog Whisperer.

22:34.219 --> 22:35.914
What are you doing out there?

22:35.987 --> 22:39.684
- Can't sleep.
- Me neither.

22:40.892 --> 22:44.726
By the time I get done with all my stuff
I just can't pass out for eight hours.

22:44.796 --> 22:47.424
I need a little down time, you know?

22:47.933 --> 22:49.298
Down time.

22:50.268 --> 22:51.701
Yeah.

22:51.770 --> 22:53.670
To just sit here.

22:54.873 --> 22:59.367
Do nothing. Just look at the stars.

23:02.681 --> 23:04.205
They make you feel so small.

23:04.282 --> 23:06.614
I just lose myself when I look up there.

23:11.189 --> 23:13.749
I heard how you don't remember anything.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.362
That must be really hard.

23:18.764 --> 23:20.322
Scary.

23:25.670 --> 23:27.570
I should get some sleep.

23:29.541 --> 23:31.099
You should too, Kyle.

23:37.315 --> 23:40.079
I bet your family's searching for you
right now.

23:40.852 --> 23:42.615
I mean, they have to be.

23:44.189 --> 23:46.248
You didn't just fall from the sky.

24:14.653 --> 24:17.486
- What are you doing?
- Walking.

24:17.989 --> 24:20.719
- Why are you out of bed?
- I wasn't sleeping.

24:20.792 --> 24:23.659
Stop skulking around.
You'll give a person a heart attack.

24:23.728 --> 24:25.389
- Lori?
- Oh, great.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.526
- What's going on?
- I heard him down here.

24:30.602 --> 24:33.901
- I wanted to make sure he was OK.
- With full makeup on?

24:33.972 --> 24:36.497
What? I haven't washed my face yet.

24:36.575 --> 24:38.065
- Upstairs. Now.
- Dad, I...

24:38.143 --> 24:39.906
- I was just...
- Move.

24:44.783 --> 24:45.909
Kyle.

24:47.319 --> 24:48.616
Did you get any sleep?

24:49.888 --> 24:51.219
No.

24:51.289 --> 24:53.052
All right.
Come on, upstairs.

24:53.158 --> 24:54.682
Let's go back to bed.

25:07.706 --> 25:10.869
- What happened?
- It's OK. Go back to sleep.

25:12.677 --> 25:15.441
- Where did you go?
- Outside.

25:15.547 --> 25:17.242
You went outside, Kyle?

25:18.950 --> 25:21.009
- Yes.
- What did you do?

25:22.988 --> 25:25.354
I looked at the stars.

25:26.324 --> 25:29.657
OK, now's not the time
for stargazing, Kyle.

25:30.262 --> 25:32.560
Now's the time to get some sleep.

25:33.932 --> 25:35.900
I'll see you guys in the morning.

25:44.175 --> 25:46.143
You had to be out there, didn't you?

25:46.244 --> 25:47.711
Under the stars?

25:48.947 --> 25:50.710
So they could find you.

25:51.416 --> 25:53.577
Were they gonna beam you up?

25:54.286 --> 25:56.447
- Beam me?
- Your peeps, dude.

25:56.555 --> 25:59.524
Your real family in the stars.

26:24.549 --> 26:26.107
- Coffee?
- Black.

26:26.217 --> 26:28.947
In fact, just toss me the can.
I'll chew on the grinds.

26:29.020 --> 26:31.113
You never fell back to sleep, either?

26:32.824 --> 26:35.554
- At least Kyle got some sleep.
- You checked on him?

26:35.627 --> 26:38.095
His door was closed.
I was afraid to make a sound.

26:38.163 --> 26:40.393
'Morning.
I need a cup of joe.

26:41.399 --> 26:43.833
You need a pick-me-up?
Make chocolate milk.

26:44.502 --> 26:46.800
- Kyle still asleep?
- Not in his bed.

26:46.871 --> 26:48.304
He isn't?

26:49.708 --> 26:51.801
- Kyle?
- Check the bathtub.

26:51.876 --> 26:53.434
He loves it in there.

26:54.779 --> 26:56.542
I wonder if he wandered out again.

26:56.648 --> 26:59.412
- When did he wander out before?
- Found him.

27:05.757 --> 27:06.883
Kyle?

27:08.793 --> 27:10.351
What are you doing?

27:10.996 --> 27:13.294
- Waiting.
- For what?

27:14.666 --> 27:15.963
To go home.

27:22.340 --> 27:23.898
Tell me he's not an alien.

27:39.758 --> 27:43.125
I spoke to Dr. Stone and he can't
understand why the pill didn't work.

27:43.228 --> 27:45.492
It didn't do anything.
He's still rarin' to go.

27:45.563 --> 27:48.623
He said if this continues
he wants to admit Kyle and sedate him.

27:48.700 --> 27:50.167
Well, he should.

27:50.235 --> 27:51.600
- No.
- He has to sleep.

27:51.703 --> 27:54.604
No. I don't want Kyle knocked out
in some hospital.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.607
But what we're doing isn't working.

27:56.675 --> 28:00.202
He needs to be where it's familiar,
where he feels comfortable.

28:00.278 --> 28:04.237
Well, how comfortable can he be
if he can't sleep here?

28:12.524 --> 28:14.651
So, what happened last night?

28:14.726 --> 28:17.456
- You never came out.
- Sorry, I got nabbed.

28:20.799 --> 28:23.165
It feels like you're jerking me around.

28:23.268 --> 28:26.032
- Declan, my parents caught me...
- You and who?

28:26.104 --> 28:27.662
That guy Kyle?

28:27.772 --> 28:29.433
Was he in there with you?

28:30.041 --> 28:32.669
Look, Kyle's one
of my mother's head cases.

28:32.744 --> 28:36.009
He's just staying with us.
Hilary was messing with you.

28:36.081 --> 28:37.844
- That right?
- Yeah.

28:38.550 --> 28:41.519
- So come by tonight.
- You gonna leave me hangin' again?

28:41.619 --> 28:44.179
No way. I'm so there.

28:47.158 --> 28:49.217
OK, then. Later, Trager.

28:49.294 --> 28:50.921
Later.

29:03.508 --> 29:06.170
- Where are we running?
- No place.

29:06.244 --> 29:08.075
We're just running.

29:10.281 --> 29:11.976
Why are we running?

29:13.184 --> 29:15.243
Well, the plan is to exhaust you.

29:15.320 --> 29:17.880
We started at ten after, right?

29:19.090 --> 29:22.253
- Gotta go at least a half an hour.
- Why?

29:22.794 --> 29:25.820
It's good exercise,
gets rid of stress.

29:26.297 --> 29:27.594
Stress?

29:28.199 --> 29:30.224
Yeah, pressure.
You know, tension.

29:31.069 --> 29:34.732
Running takes away what's worrying me.
It's my time to escape.

29:35.874 --> 29:40.106
But you watch time when you run and time
is just numbers that people made up.

29:41.146 --> 29:43.671
We need those numbers
to keep order in the world.

29:45.083 --> 29:47.449
So you can never really escape time?

29:47.552 --> 29:49.315
You can never just be.

29:50.922 --> 29:53.891
Well, I think you can escape
in your own head.

29:56.327 --> 29:58.659
Let's pick up the pace.

29:58.730 --> 30:00.163
Go faster.

30:23.888 --> 30:26.254
- Hey, how did it go?
- I'm beat.

30:26.891 --> 30:29.018
He's ready for a marathon.

30:29.093 --> 30:31.584
It's incredible.
That kid's a lightning bolt.

30:31.663 --> 30:32.925
Look at this.

30:32.997 --> 30:34.328
This line he drew.

30:34.399 --> 30:37.095
It has nothing to do
with the rest of the picture.

30:37.168 --> 30:38.692
That's strange.

30:38.770 --> 30:42.069
Stephen, I'm gonna stay up
and watch him tonight,

30:42.140 --> 30:44.370
make sure he doesn't wander out again.

30:44.442 --> 30:46.103
You gonna camp out by his door?

30:46.177 --> 30:49.146
Well, I just think he'd feel more secure
with me nearby.

30:49.914 --> 30:51.643
All right.
We'll go in shifts.

30:52.283 --> 30:55.150
- Me first.
- I knew I loved you.

31:01.993 --> 31:04.120
No midnight Xbox for me tonight.

31:04.195 --> 31:06.561
And no nasty-nasty
for you and Declan either.

31:06.631 --> 31:08.394
What are you talking about?

31:08.466 --> 31:10.957
They're posting guard
to keep track of Kyle.

31:11.035 --> 31:12.900
Right out my door.

31:12.971 --> 31:14.529
Oh, no.

31:15.840 --> 31:18.172
Yeah. Welcome to Alcatraz.

31:24.249 --> 31:26.581
You're killing me.
Can't you slip by them?

31:26.651 --> 31:29.586
- No. Come back later.
- So you can bail on me again?

31:29.654 --> 31:31.952
Don't go high-maintenance on me.

31:32.523 --> 31:34.855
Maybe they'll fall asleep
and I can sneak out.

31:34.926 --> 31:36.826
I'm not staying up for a "maybe. "

31:36.895 --> 31:39.125
Then we'll have
to make it another time.

31:47.772 --> 31:50.332
- You're not happy.
- No, Kyle, I'm thrilled.

31:50.408 --> 31:52.376
You don't sound thrilled.

31:53.378 --> 31:55.869
It's called sarcasm.
Get used to it.

31:57.582 --> 31:59.049
You wanted to leave with him.

31:59.117 --> 32:02.086
No, I wanted to stay here,
trapped in my room all night.

32:02.754 --> 32:05.484
- Sarcasm.
- You're catching on.

32:08.126 --> 32:09.457
Why did you want to go?

32:11.329 --> 32:13.957
Because we have a good time.

32:15.333 --> 32:17.563
Can't you have a good time another time?

32:19.370 --> 32:21.338
I don't know. Maybe.

32:21.406 --> 32:24.170
It doesn't work that way with us.
We don't make plans.

32:24.242 --> 32:25.800
Why?

32:25.910 --> 32:28.845
Kyle, you ask too many questions.
Get out. Go to bed.

32:46.531 --> 32:47.691
Stephen.

32:47.765 --> 32:50.666
Hmm? Wha?

32:50.735 --> 32:52.703
Is he asleep?

32:57.875 --> 32:59.968
Go. You have a huge meeting tomorrow.

33:00.044 --> 33:01.341
I'll take over.

33:02.480 --> 33:03.640
OK.

33:08.319 --> 33:09.809
Thank you.

33:13.024 --> 33:14.787
Are you feeling tired at all?

33:16.461 --> 33:19.589
My body feels slower.
My muscles ache a bit.

33:19.664 --> 33:21.598
Good. That's good.

33:21.666 --> 33:24.328
But my head can't stop thinking.

33:25.303 --> 33:27.601
You have to clear your head, Kyle.

33:27.672 --> 33:30.732
Do what I do.
Count backwards from 100.

33:35.713 --> 33:37.806
You counted already?

33:39.083 --> 33:41.517
OK. Count backwards from 1,000.

33:41.586 --> 33:43.019
No, 100,000.

33:43.087 --> 33:45.578
And if that doesn't work,
try 100 million.

34:22.226 --> 34:25.922
12,680... 12,679...

34:25.996 --> 34:27.862
Still counting?

34:34.972 --> 34:36.496
- Sweetie.
- What? What?

34:36.574 --> 34:39.509
- We overslept.
- My meeting!

34:39.577 --> 34:42.068
Is it too late?

34:42.146 --> 34:45.603
Damn it, Nicole, I can't afford
to make mistakes like this.

34:45.683 --> 34:48.379
We'll get over this hump.
Kyle will acclimate.

34:49.554 --> 34:51.920
This was supposed to be temporary.

34:52.322 --> 34:54.848
You said he'd be here
until somebody claimed him

34:54.926 --> 34:56.484
or you found him another place.

34:56.594 --> 34:59.859
- I'm trying to.
- You spend all day caring for him.

34:59.931 --> 35:01.364
He wakes us up every night.

35:01.432 --> 35:03.059
It's like having a new baby.

35:03.134 --> 35:04.863
New babies keep you up.

35:04.936 --> 35:07.837
Yeah, but this one is huge,
and he's not our kid!

35:07.905 --> 35:09.805
He doesn't belong here, Nicole.

35:13.444 --> 35:16.936
We can't just abandon him because
it's not easy to have him around.

35:17.849 --> 35:20.579
We're the only thing he has right now.

35:22.787 --> 35:24.618
And I can't give up on him.

35:35.867 --> 35:37.027
Kyle.

35:52.350 --> 35:54.079
Thank you.

35:54.152 --> 35:57.781
Detective Breen has squad cars
in the area still looking for him.

35:57.855 --> 36:00.380
He has been gone all day.
Is that all they can do?

36:00.458 --> 36:02.426
Do they know Kyle's sort of different?

36:02.527 --> 36:05.826
They know all about him.
Kyle's listed as a missing person.

36:05.897 --> 36:08.559
So our missing person's missing.

36:08.633 --> 36:10.726
It's not funny.
It's gonna get dark soon.

36:10.801 --> 36:13.133
- Kyle could get hurt.
- Since when do you care?

36:13.204 --> 36:15.570
I don't want anything bad
to happen to him.

36:17.041 --> 36:20.374
It's my fault. I was horrible to him.
That's why he ran away.

36:20.444 --> 36:24.005
No, sweetheart. Actually,
I think he overheard me and your dad.

36:24.115 --> 36:26.640
- We may have upset him.
- Well, I was nice to him.

36:27.318 --> 36:28.979
I was!

36:29.053 --> 36:30.350
Sort of.

36:35.293 --> 36:38.729
I've been all over the neighborhood.
There's no sign of him.

36:40.398 --> 36:42.889
Let's check downtown
where the cops found him.

36:42.967 --> 36:45.299
No, I think the city frightened him.

36:45.369 --> 36:47.200
I just don't think he would go there.

36:47.271 --> 36:49.034
Kyle doesn't know anywhere to go.

36:56.080 --> 36:57.342
Yes, he does.

37:04.956 --> 37:07.720
Nicole, this is a long shot.

37:07.792 --> 37:10.693
- It's worth trying.
- Why would he come out here?

37:10.761 --> 37:14.527
Besides our house,
this is the only home he knows.

37:14.599 --> 37:16.567
He's here to go home.

37:16.634 --> 37:19.262
ET, phone home.

37:20.371 --> 37:24.933
This stump looks like a landing pad
for a shuttle, sent by his mother ship.

37:25.009 --> 37:27.876
- Oh, for Pete's sake.
- We should have left him home.

37:27.945 --> 37:31.244
How did he even make it out here
on his own?

37:31.315 --> 37:34.478
Dad, you're talking about someone
with no belly button.

37:35.586 --> 37:37.213
Who knows what he can do.

37:37.288 --> 37:40.257
- Dork, he's not up there.
- I'm looking for the craft.

37:40.358 --> 37:41.916
Come on. Knock it off.

37:43.327 --> 37:44.885
Kyle.

37:49.500 --> 37:50.558
Kyle!

37:55.506 --> 37:56.768
Kyle.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.647
It's OK.

38:09.587 --> 38:10.747
Gotcha.

38:18.863 --> 38:21.525
You're OK.
We were so worried.

38:21.599 --> 38:23.362
What are you doing here?

38:23.467 --> 38:24.627
Why'd you come?

38:25.736 --> 38:28.830
I came so my family could find me.

38:34.512 --> 38:36.673
I think we just did.

38:40.584 --> 38:43.485
- Come on.
- Come on.

39:07.345 --> 39:10.109
<i>I understood then...
we need patterns.</i>

39:10.848 --> 39:13.874
<i>Time to be awake, time to rest.</i>

39:15.319 --> 39:17.844
Congratulations.
You look exhausted.

39:19.390 --> 39:21.153
You feel it?

39:22.827 --> 39:23.885
Yes.

39:24.562 --> 39:25.995
But what if I don't sleep?

39:26.063 --> 39:28.497
Oh, tonight is your night, Kyle.

39:29.700 --> 39:32.362
You just have to find
the right spot for yourself.

39:32.436 --> 39:34.597
Now, just relax.
Get comfortable.

39:36.340 --> 39:38.171
Be right back.

40:15.579 --> 40:16.944
How's he doing?

40:18.048 --> 40:20.608
Well, he looks beat.

40:21.552 --> 40:23.452
But who knows?

40:23.521 --> 40:25.682
We may be in for another long night.

40:25.756 --> 40:27.917
Well, let's get him to bed.

40:34.965 --> 40:36.125
Kyle?

41:05.062 --> 41:06.222
Dad?

41:06.297 --> 41:08.959
I know.
But that's where he's most comfortable.

41:09.033 --> 41:10.261
In the bathtub?

41:11.068 --> 41:14.834
- Who cares? At least he's asleep.
- If people find out, I will die.

41:14.905 --> 41:17.373
I'm telling you, this guy's an alien.

41:17.441 --> 41:20.137
I'm calling Steven Spielberg.

41:20.211 --> 41:22.873
OK.

41:25.349 --> 41:28.910
Now that he's finally asleep
I have a ton of stuff to catch up on.

41:28.986 --> 41:30.351
Hold on, hold on.

41:31.522 --> 41:35.788
You just stay here and be with me.

41:47.805 --> 41:49.830
I'm so glad Kyle can rest.

41:50.875 --> 41:53.639
Now he can start to remember.

41:59.550 --> 42:01.780
<i>To finally sleep.</i>

42:01.852 --> 42:06.016
<i>A few hours of blissful escape before
facing those questions once again...</i>

42:07.958 --> 42:09.585
<i>...of who I am</i>

42:09.660 --> 42:11.287
<i>and where I'd come from.</i>
