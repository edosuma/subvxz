SuperSubs

04:49.730 --> 04:52.667
Long be unbroken.

05:11.786 --> 05:13.519
I worked overtime again,

05:13.521 --> 05:17.225
and barely made it home to make dinner
for my beloved siblings.

05:18.625 --> 05:20.892
No, he offered me the promotion!

05:20.894 --> 05:23.161
Basically. It was implied.

05:23.163 --> 05:24.829
Come on! Switch weapons!

05:24.831 --> 05:27.699
You'll never win with that BB gun!

05:27.701 --> 05:29.834
ever get laid with that haircut.

05:29.836 --> 05:33.438
- Dave, really?
- Really. It's a shitty haircut.

05:33.440 --> 05:35.140
We have the same haircut.

05:35.142 --> 05:38.510
You guys should try a real game.
Use some imagination.

05:38.512 --> 05:40.445
Save some electricity.

05:40.447 --> 05:41.846
I have a good beginner dungeon.

05:41.848 --> 05:44.315
Yeah,
good luck with that nerd queen!

05:44.317 --> 05:45.286
Watch those corners!

05:46.821 --> 05:48.723
God! No!

05:49.723 --> 05:50.889
Shit!

05:50.891 --> 05:52.524
Can you at least quiet down a little?

05:52.526 --> 05:54.860
Switch around! Switch around!

05:54.862 --> 05:56.364
Shit! Yes...

05:57.865 --> 05:59.367
...and wave it like a flag.

06:01.468 --> 06:02.736
Shit, shit.

06:18.485 --> 06:20.351
That was a saving throw.

06:20.353 --> 06:23.488
I rolled to see if you'd survive
a blackout spell.

06:23.490 --> 06:25.890
You didn't. See? Isn't that fun?

06:25.892 --> 06:27.892
What the hell's wrong with you?

06:27.894 --> 06:29.928
Dinner's ready, so game's over.

06:29.930 --> 06:31.765
Damn right it's over.

06:33.901 --> 06:36.668
I busted my ass on that, you punk!

06:36.670 --> 06:38.536
Smells like your ass too!

06:38.538 --> 06:42.774
Jesus, Dave! My mom's making
crap for dinner. I wanted meat!

06:42.776 --> 06:44.909
I'm not making anything else!

06:53.588 --> 06:55.390
The die never lie.

07:28.422 --> 07:31.459
I'd play your Dragons or whatever
if you asked me to.

07:32.660 --> 07:34.829
That would be hilarious.

07:37.398 --> 07:40.565
- You're serious?
- Why not? You make it sound like...

07:40.567 --> 07:43.837
I don't know, I'm just saying
that I'd play if you asked.

07:49.442 --> 07:51.976
When, exactly?

07:51.978 --> 07:53.949
Can you hang on a second.

07:55.548 --> 07:59.450
It's a shower night tonight,
so lights out at 9:30.

07:59.452 --> 08:02.990
kill you to wash a dish either.

08:04.959 --> 08:07.995
Hey. Nothing really.
It's just the usual.

08:09.730 --> 08:14.369
My brother is a snarling ball
of anger and my sister is...

08:14.735 --> 08:16.468
herself.

08:16.470 --> 08:17.872
Good times.

08:19.339 --> 08:20.639
"Dishes."

08:20.641 --> 08:23.311
You really need to prioritize.

08:54.875 --> 08:57.843
She just wants to play with you.

08:57.845 --> 08:59.511
By unplugging the TV?

08:59.513 --> 09:02.046
Embarrassing me
in front of my friends?

09:02.048 --> 09:04.717
Dave,
u're on that thing all the time.

09:04.719 --> 09:07.353
Barbara is reaching out,
and that's good.

09:07.355 --> 09:10.355
No, it's weird and stupid!

09:10.357 --> 09:14.526
- Why do you care...
loud or she'll hear us talking.

09:34.914 --> 09:36.681
<i>...it popped up again!</i>

09:36.683 --> 09:41.322
<i>On third, Hayes has room.
Hayes makes the catch!</i>

10:05.712 --> 10:07.579
Thurisaz.

10:07.581 --> 10:10.916
The Thorn. The Hammer.

10:10.918 --> 10:13.786
Take the force of my enemy

10:13.788 --> 10:18.092
and send it back to him
a thousand thousand times.

10:56.629 --> 10:58.500
Time to work.

12:34.094 --> 12:37.195
One, two, three, four, five,

12:37.197 --> 12:42.199
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven,

12:42.201 --> 12:45.139
twelve, thirteen, fourteen,
fifteen, sixteen...

12:46.606 --> 12:47.774
Hi.

12:50.110 --> 12:52.877
Are you playing a game?

12:52.879 --> 12:54.548
I don't think so.

12:56.984 --> 12:58.849
If you were, I would...

12:58.851 --> 13:01.688
join you or... I don't know.

13:03.724 --> 13:04.692
I'm Sophia.

13:06.025 --> 13:09.594
We moved here from Leeds, England.

13:09.596 --> 13:11.632
No one here knows Leeds. Only London.

13:19.105 --> 13:20.839
It's stinky.

13:20.841 --> 13:23.711
- What's it for?
- Pray you never find out.

13:26.179 --> 13:28.213
What's with the ears?

13:28.215 --> 13:30.317
Tribute to my spirit guide.

13:31.784 --> 13:34.652
That's interesting.

13:34.654 --> 13:37.791
I, Nice meeting you.

13:39.058 --> 13:40.794
You have a pretty name.

13:42.962 --> 13:46.297
- And I like the way you talk.
- Thank you.

13:46.299 --> 13:47.601
What's your...

13:49.836 --> 13:51.402
Okay...

13:51.404 --> 13:52.307
thanks.

14:07.988 --> 14:11.055
I understand
what "these times" require, sir.

14:11.057 --> 14:13.025
We're allowed three personal days,

14:13.027 --> 14:15.863
and I know that Mr. Guggenheim
considers personal attendance.

14:18.231 --> 14:22.968
No, my sister, she's just a kid,
she can't help, she's...

14:22.970 --> 14:25.237
She can't help with anything.

14:25.239 --> 14:31.376
Um, I'm not a special case.
just asking for common courtesy!

14:31.378 --> 14:35.249
No, obviously, I want to keep my job.
I'm just...

14:39.253 --> 14:40.722
Okay.

14:42.221 --> 14:44.989
Okay, thank you so much, thank you.

14:44.991 --> 14:46.892
Okay, bye.

14:46.894 --> 14:47.762
Bye.

15:28.902 --> 15:30.204
Can I look too?

15:31.238 --> 15:33.070
Thanks!

15:33.072 --> 15:35.442
We're at the same bus stop. Hi, again.

15:36.509 --> 15:38.910
Wow, that looks cool!

15:38.912 --> 15:42.817
Yeah, that's it.
Dark Omens are totally "cool".

15:44.951 --> 15:46.450
What does that mean?

15:46.452 --> 15:48.990
It means my life
is about to get complicated.

15:49.756 --> 15:50.824
Again.

15:54.360 --> 15:55.763
Can I sit next to you?

15:56.797 --> 15:58.095
Why?

15:58.097 --> 16:01.935
You're the only kid I know
in like, all of America.

16:04.804 --> 16:05.839
Hi.

16:23.090 --> 16:24.292
Nine...

16:27.226 --> 16:28.462
Ten...

16:30.397 --> 16:31.966
Eleven...

16:35.134 --> 16:36.370
Twelve...

16:38.404 --> 16:39.874
Thirteen...

16:43.243 --> 16:44.512
Fourteen...

16:53.220 --> 16:54.788
Thirty-four...

16:55.522 --> 16:57.024
Thirty-five...

16:58.524 --> 17:00.026
Thirty-six...

17:01.327 --> 17:02.329
Thirty-seven...

17:08.402 --> 17:10.003
Thirty-eight...

17:12.338 --> 17:13.339
Damn it!

17:47.007 --> 17:49.343
- Excuse me.
- You're excused.

18:50.569 --> 18:52.472
You make a better door than window.

18:53.973 --> 18:55.273
My table.

18:55.275 --> 18:57.111
You owe me a toll.

18:57.477 --> 18:58.946
Give it.

19:01.480 --> 19:02.482
That's all I got.

19:03.482 --> 19:04.618
Keep the change.

19:07.287 --> 19:08.652
You're dead!

19:08.654 --> 19:11.122
Barbara Thorson!

19:11.124 --> 19:14.359
Barbara Thorson!
Mrs. Mollé's office, now.

19:14.361 --> 19:15.994
Please!

19:15.996 --> 19:18.132
Have fun at the shrink, psycho.

19:22.435 --> 19:24.004
She is so weird.

19:25.672 --> 19:29.673
You might not believe this,
you know more about Birch than I do.

19:29.675 --> 19:33.010
I am new here, so you're the expert.

19:33.012 --> 19:36.648
I was hoping you can tell me
a little bit about what you like here,

19:36.650 --> 19:38.686
what you don't.

19:42.021 --> 19:45.158
I've already heard to stay away
from the beef teriyaki.

19:52.298 --> 19:54.035
I really like your pocketbook.

19:55.035 --> 19:56.668
It's nice.

19:56.670 --> 19:59.304
I don't know what

19:59.306 --> 20:02.172
Covliski means.

20:02.174 --> 20:05.309
Cov... Covliski.

20:05.311 --> 20:06.478
What does it mean?

20:06.480 --> 20:08.313
Strike one.

20:08.315 --> 20:10.015
What?

20:10.017 --> 20:12.217
Barbara, you're not being tested.
We're just talking.

20:12.219 --> 20:16.086
For the record, I'm not being difficult
I think your profession is B.S.

20:16.088 --> 20:19.724
I'm busy so I don't have time
be delicate with your feelings.

20:19.726 --> 20:22.663
So you don't even want to know
why you're here?

20:24.163 --> 20:26.797
I am here because people fear
what they don't understand.

20:26.799 --> 20:30.503
I am good with that,
so we're done here.

20:31.738 --> 20:33.404
And next time,

20:33.406 --> 20:35.707
use a sky writer to call me
to the shrink's office.

20:35.709 --> 20:38.209
- Less embarrassing.
- No, I told them...

20:38.211 --> 20:39.279
Yeah.

20:42.348 --> 20:43.616
Wow...

20:58.131 --> 21:01.099
You think it's funny to spit on people?

21:01.101 --> 21:04.134
Not "ha-ha" funny,
but existentially, yes.

21:04.136 --> 21:07.138
You're a disgusting little

21:07.140 --> 21:08.509
bitch.

21:09.509 --> 21:10.778
Open your pocketbook.

21:12.244 --> 21:14.080
What I find, I keep.

21:15.781 --> 21:17.283
If you don't walk away,

21:18.451 --> 21:19.817
right now,

21:19.819 --> 21:23.688
I will do things to you
that will make God cry.

21:23.690 --> 21:25.326
Taylor!

21:26.393 --> 21:27.260
What's going on?

21:29.128 --> 21:30.862
My office.

21:30.864 --> 21:31.798
Now.

21:33.567 --> 21:35.269
A week's suspension.

21:35.868 --> 21:37.538
Let's go.

21:39.538 --> 21:41.271
<i>You're pretty brave</i>

21:41.273 --> 21:43.274
for someone who looks
like they live in a magazine.

21:43.276 --> 21:45.645
I saw Taylor grab you
and got the principal.

21:46.480 --> 21:48.479
You stood up to her.

21:48.481 --> 21:50.183
Think you didn't?

21:50.750 --> 21:52.586
You think I did?

21:53.519 --> 21:55.286
I did.

21:55.288 --> 21:56.289
She's gonna kill me.

21:57.691 --> 21:59.457
No.

21:59.459 --> 22:02.861
Taylor's a bully.
All bullies are the same:

22:02.863 --> 22:05.763
Soon as you stand up to them,
they crumble.

22:05.765 --> 22:07.634
Just like giants.

22:08.634 --> 22:10.434
Giants?

22:10.436 --> 22:12.703
Like in your books?

22:12.705 --> 22:15.575
Dragons and stuff? You like that?

22:17.676 --> 22:19.212
It's weird?

22:20.413 --> 22:21.749
I don't know.

22:23.316 --> 22:25.219
Yeah. A little.

22:27.787 --> 22:30.091
What's so cool about giants?

22:33.626 --> 22:36.594
This is my sanctuary.

22:36.596 --> 22:39.197
A holy place.

22:39.199 --> 22:41.201
You want to know about giants,

22:41.701 --> 22:43.237
you learn here.

22:52.679 --> 22:53.878
It's been said

22:53.880 --> 22:56.713
ll giants are descended from Ur,

22:56.715 --> 22:58.449
the first giant,

22:58.451 --> 23:01.686
who was the misbegotten son
of the Earth and Sky.

23:01.688 --> 23:02.890
Twenty miles tall...

23:03.557 --> 23:05.390
What?

23:05.392 --> 23:08.226
Misbegotten means
the Earth and the Sky did <i>it</i>,

23:08.228 --> 23:09.763
but they weren't married?

23:10.564 --> 23:12.497
Yeah.

23:12.499 --> 23:14.367
My older brother was misbegotten.

23:16.502 --> 23:17.370
Okay.

23:18.238 --> 23:21.842
So Ur is twenty miles tall,

23:22.541 --> 23:24.642
but he's alone.

23:24.644 --> 23:26.878
He's the only one.

23:26.880 --> 23:30.215
He's so lonely that in his anguish,

23:30.217 --> 23:32.920
he tears himself apart.

23:33.787 --> 23:35.886
<i>Giving birth</i>

23:35.888 --> 23:37.988
<i>to giants.</i>

23:39.792 --> 23:42.526
<i>The first dark kings of the Earth.</i>

23:42.528 --> 23:45.165
<i>At least
that's what they liked to think.</i>

23:45.798 --> 23:47.966
<i>Giants are vermin,</i>

23:47.968 --> 23:50.867
<i>like rats or pigeons.</i>

23:50.869 --> 23:52.670
<i>But huge, of course.</i>

23:52.672 --> 23:56.743
<i>They can hit thirty feet
and come in all flavors.</i>

23:57.978 --> 24:01.679
<i>Frost Giants have hair of living ice,</i>

24:01.681 --> 24:04.282
<i>and use human kidney</i>

24:04.284 --> 24:06.853
<i>garnish when they eat reindeer.</i>

24:10.923 --> 24:15.325
<i>Swamp Giants will clear out
a whole village of people,</i>

24:15.327 --> 24:19.799
<i>just to replace them
with dolls made of vines.</i>

24:21.300 --> 24:25.436
<i>Mountain Giants
bathe in the blood of children,</i>

24:25.438 --> 24:28.709
<i>and have a penchant
for singing shepherd songs.</i>

24:29.942 --> 24:33.344
<i>These creeps, they're Harbingers.</i>

24:33.346 --> 24:37.481
<i>They just like to watch.
Totally sketchy.</i>

24:37.483 --> 24:41.619
<i>You see a Harbinger, a Giant is around.</i>

24:43.056 --> 24:46.824
<i>Even worse, though, Titans.</i>

24:46.826 --> 24:49.693
<i>These are the big guys.</i>

24:49.695 --> 24:51.929
<i>Like Greek myth stuff.</i>

24:51.931 --> 24:55.533
<i>Hearts of blackest opal.</i>

24:55.535 --> 25:00.004
<i>A laugh boils your blood in your body.</i>

25:00.006 --> 25:02.910
<i>Eyes that make the sun go out.</i>

25:06.578 --> 25:08.613
Can you imagine that?

25:08.615 --> 25:10.882
Something so horrible,

25:10.884 --> 25:13.886
the sun won't shine on it.

25:15.454 --> 25:16.888
Don't be scared.

25:16.890 --> 25:18.892
No one's seen a Titan
since the dawn of recorded history.

25:20.093 --> 25:21.325
Good.

25:21.327 --> 25:24.495
The real problem is regular giants.

25:24.497 --> 25:25.729
Total dicks.

25:25.731 --> 25:28.365
This was a bad year for giants.

25:28.367 --> 25:33.371
People always write them off
as tornadoes and earthquakes and crap,

25:33.373 --> 25:37.378
but if you open your eyes,
you see the omens and know the truth.

25:38.678 --> 25:40.411
Ever lose a dog?

25:40.413 --> 25:44.681
- Yeah, it got hit by a car.
- Probably not.

25:44.683 --> 25:46.851
Probably hors d'oeuvres for a giant.

25:46.853 --> 25:49.789
No, my dad backed over it.

25:50.423 --> 25:51.922
Lucky.

25:51.924 --> 25:54.092
So what if you do see the omens

25:54.094 --> 25:56.063
and one really comes?

25:58.865 --> 26:00.664
That's where I come in.

26:00.666 --> 26:02.734
I find giants.

26:02.736 --> 26:04.538
I hunt giants.

26:05.538 --> 26:08.008
I kill giants.

26:11.544 --> 26:12.579
With this.

26:13.813 --> 26:16.381
Inside this modest sheath

26:16.383 --> 26:18.882
slumbers the finest war hammer

26:18.884 --> 26:20.684
ever made.

26:20.686 --> 26:23.421
The thunder-maker. Light bringer.

26:23.423 --> 26:26.123
Forged from a fragment of bone

26:26.125 --> 26:29.363
from the jaw of Ur himself...

26:29.929 --> 26:31.962
One perfect strike

26:31.964 --> 26:35.533
would drop even the tallest of giants.

26:35.535 --> 26:36.370
Can I see it?

26:38.104 --> 26:40.036
This is a sacred vessel.

26:40.038 --> 26:42.875
Can it only be opened when duty calls.

26:45.711 --> 26:47.347
"Coveleski."

26:49.048 --> 26:51.417
Weapons of great renown
have to have a name.

26:54.921 --> 26:57.154
Coveleski was a baseball player.

26:57.156 --> 27:00.360
A rookie for the Philadelphia Phillies
100 years ago.

27:06.499 --> 27:07.367
Are you okay?

27:13.772 --> 27:16.140
What's the matter? Barbara?

27:16.142 --> 27:18.575
Sorry... I have to go.

27:18.577 --> 27:19.911
Barbara! Hey!

27:19.913 --> 27:22.712
You don't want to get too close to me.

27:22.714 --> 27:25.016
People close to me get hurt.

30:29.969 --> 30:32.239
I'm over here!

30:34.039 --> 30:37.210
Now this way, you big idiot.

30:38.277 --> 30:39.346
Damn it...

31:02.101 --> 31:04.204
<i>Barbara!</i>

31:19.751 --> 31:21.721
<i>Barbara!</i>

31:25.223 --> 31:27.894
<i>Barbara!</i>

32:01.394 --> 32:03.026
<i>Barbara!</i>

32:07.299 --> 32:09.702
<i>Barbara!</i>

33:05.458 --> 33:07.958
<i>I made a friend.</i>

33:07.960 --> 33:09.794
Her name is Sophia.

33:09.796 --> 33:12.496
She wears nice clothes, but...

33:12.498 --> 33:16.100
She's English so that's to be expected.

33:16.102 --> 33:19.068
So, see? I'm normal. Can I go now?

33:19.070 --> 33:22.072
There's serious stuff going down
I have to deal with.

33:22.074 --> 33:23.877
Do you have many friends?

33:26.378 --> 33:27.978
Right.

33:27.980 --> 33:29.880
Why not, Barbara?

33:29.882 --> 33:33.851
Because most kids my age
care more about who's on TV

33:33.853 --> 33:37.421
or if they have cool sneakers
than talking to me.

33:37.423 --> 33:40.393
And I'm a little mean
to people who are dumb.

33:41.326 --> 33:42.996
And most people are dumb.

33:45.263 --> 33:47.000
What about your sister?
Is your sister Karen dumb?

33:49.268 --> 33:51.004
Family is "strike two" territory.

33:53.471 --> 33:54.540
Barbara...

33:56.174 --> 33:57.341
I'm sorry.

33:57.343 --> 33:59.509
Sometimes I push too hard too soon,

33:59.511 --> 34:02.848
but it's because I want
to get to know you a bit more.

34:04.150 --> 34:05.481
Okay?

34:05.483 --> 34:06.883
I'll go first.

34:06.885 --> 34:08.485
I wasn't always a psychologist...

34:08.487 --> 34:11.286
That would be impossible
unless you were cloned from one.

34:11.289 --> 34:14.357
- I assume you were a baby.
- Yes, I was a baby.

34:14.359 --> 34:15.391
Then a child,

34:15.393 --> 34:16.893
then a young woman,

34:16.896 --> 34:18.896
then I was a manager of
a small hedge fund.

34:18.898 --> 34:21.297
The good kind
or did you rip off old ladies?

34:21.300 --> 34:22.568
I wasn't sure.

34:27.440 --> 34:30.376
So I decided
I wanted to try something else.

34:32.344 --> 34:34.847
I thought I can to make
a difference doing this.

34:35.447 --> 34:37.014
Is that corny?

34:37.016 --> 34:40.050
The word "corny" is corny.

34:40.052 --> 34:43.920
Wanting to make a difference is nice,
but you think too small.

34:43.922 --> 34:47.326
Call me when you've saved a town,
and we can compare notes.

34:48.460 --> 34:50.427
Have you saved a town?

34:50.429 --> 34:54.601
I protect this dump like once a month
I just don't go around bragging about it.

34:56.469 --> 34:58.235
What do you protect us from?

34:58.237 --> 35:01.942
If you have to ask,
you clearly haven't read my file.

35:02.974 --> 35:04.307
I have a file.

35:04.309 --> 35:06.543
Yes, but this file
doesn't tell me who you are,

35:06.545 --> 35:08.081
how you feel.

35:17.222 --> 35:18.592
Delicious!

35:20.192 --> 35:21.094
Right.

36:12.644 --> 36:14.577
Gumbs, Nehring,

36:14.579 --> 36:16.380
Rugg, you're in red.

36:16.382 --> 36:18.148
The rest of you are in blue today.

36:18.150 --> 36:20.550
You know that forest giant
I told you about?

36:20.552 --> 36:22.286
He's getting ballsy!

36:22.288 --> 36:23.653
We have to find him.

36:23.655 --> 36:25.421
I don't want to get
anyone into trouble.

36:25.423 --> 36:26.623
We're already in trouble.

36:26.625 --> 36:28.425
Hey! L'il Posh Spice!

36:28.427 --> 36:30.494
Zip it!
Thorson, drop the book.

36:30.496 --> 36:32.329
Huddle up!

36:32.331 --> 36:35.599
Today we're gonna take a stab
at America's favorite pastime:

36:35.601 --> 36:36.733
baseball.

36:36.735 --> 36:38.434
Miss Laney? Can I be excused?

36:38.436 --> 36:41.271
I might have food poisoning
or a twisted ankle.

36:41.273 --> 36:44.374
It's just baseball, Thorson.
You just stand there...

36:44.376 --> 36:47.443
- I'll take the F. Thanks.
- I thought you liked baseball.

36:47.445 --> 36:49.746
You said Coveleski was a...

36:49.748 --> 36:51.447
Harry Coveleski?

36:51.449 --> 36:54.351
That's some obscure
baseball history, Thorson.

36:54.353 --> 36:57.153
Coveleski hasn't played
in like a hundred years.

36:57.155 --> 36:59.259
any Phillies fans in the family?

37:02.527 --> 37:04.327
Miss Laney,

37:04.329 --> 37:07.266
would you describe your job
worthless or utterly pointless?

37:10.802 --> 37:13.070
Principal's office.

37:13.072 --> 37:13.740
Now.

37:47.572 --> 37:49.639
I cherish our times together.

37:49.641 --> 37:52.508
You really are the
Dalai Lama of principals.

37:52.510 --> 37:54.244
Do you want me to
make it a month?

37:54.246 --> 37:55.579
No thank you, sir.

37:55.581 --> 37:57.447
Namaste.

37:57.449 --> 37:59.051
Get out of here.

38:18.871 --> 38:20.139
Cool.

38:32.684 --> 38:34.517
<i>This is a sacred vessel.</i>

38:34.519 --> 38:37.190
<i>It can only be opened
when duty calls.</i>

38:41.460 --> 38:43.760
No. I'm sorry.

38:43.762 --> 38:47.697
I'm sorry. I wasn't really...
wasn't really going to open it.

38:53.639 --> 38:56.173
sorry. I have forgotten myself.

38:56.175 --> 38:59.809
holy quest. Coveleski is sacred.

38:59.811 --> 39:02.479
It won't ever happen again.

39:02.481 --> 39:05.581
I swear. I swear. I swear.

39:12.224 --> 39:15.726
<i>Please follow staff instructions</i>

39:15.728 --> 39:18.528
<i>and proceed in an orderly fashion</i>

39:18.530 --> 39:22.201
<i>to your assigned areas
outside of the building...</i>

39:23.835 --> 39:27.739
Okay, please. Move along.
Lucy, Jim.

39:30.643 --> 39:31.807
Where are you going?

39:31.809 --> 39:33.911
There's still three periods!

39:33.913 --> 39:35.681
Did you get the note?

39:41.519 --> 39:45.521
There are times
you have to ask yourself,

39:45.523 --> 39:47.726
"Do I want
to live my life as a coward

39:48.626 --> 39:50.230
or a warrior?"

39:51.362 --> 39:52.631
Decide.

40:42.681 --> 40:44.981
Where are we going?

40:44.983 --> 40:46.816
I've been working on a plan

40:46.818 --> 40:49.922
to lead it away from the town
to the old train graveyard.

41:04.702 --> 41:06.306
Stay close.

41:07.438 --> 41:08.373
Stay calm.

41:10.342 --> 41:12.445
It won't hurt you while I'm here.

41:17.815 --> 41:20.483
Barbara,
how long is this gonna take?

41:20.485 --> 41:22.454
Be quiet. It's up ahead.

41:24.590 --> 41:27.994
- We'll get in trouble.
- We're gonna save this town.

41:31.730 --> 41:34.000
It should have taken the second bait.

41:35.434 --> 41:37.733
Something must've caught its attention.

41:37.735 --> 41:41.371
There is no way this wouldn't work.
- Let's go back.

41:41.373 --> 41:43.340
We'll say we got locked out.

41:43.342 --> 41:45.979
Hold on. You need to see
what we're dealing with.

41:59.090 --> 42:00.923
Giants aren't real.

42:00.925 --> 42:02.561
Then why are you sweating?

42:21.746 --> 42:23.713
There you have it.

42:23.715 --> 42:25.581
Can't compete with a baby deer.

42:25.583 --> 42:28.117
Once they find food
they don't go for the bait.

42:28.119 --> 42:30.619
We're going to have to track it.

42:30.621 --> 42:33.592
I want to see if it took a bite
out of this guy, though.

42:38.364 --> 42:40.032
Might give me some clues.

42:40.932 --> 42:43.532
It sucked it up good.

42:43.534 --> 42:45.534
It's pretty drained.

42:45.536 --> 42:46.805
This is weird, Barbara.

42:48.373 --> 42:50.809
I want to go home. Now.

42:52.777 --> 42:53.545
Please!

43:01.387 --> 43:02.055
Sophia!

43:19.170 --> 43:21.373
Harbingers...

43:30.949 --> 43:34.050
ted voice) What good will you be
against real monsters?

43:34.052 --> 43:36.853
Even a dim-witted forest giant

43:36.855 --> 43:39.525
has baffled you... twice!

43:41.025 --> 43:42.127
It will be back.

43:50.001 --> 43:51.871
Just a child,

43:52.503 --> 43:53.605
so weak,

43:54.539 --> 43:56.576
so weak.

44:02.213 --> 44:04.583
Do you have wood in your garage?

44:10.755 --> 44:15.157
You won't get in trouble.
Just don't tell anyone and I'll protect you.

44:15.159 --> 44:18.530
Harbingers are creeps.
You don't want them around you.

44:20.731 --> 44:21.934
Are you afraid of blood?

44:22.568 --> 44:23.569
Yes.

44:27.606 --> 44:28.505
Don't look.

44:28.507 --> 44:30.173
Just squeeze the ice.

44:30.175 --> 44:31.907
I don't like this.

44:31.909 --> 44:34.911
- I know you're into it, but...
- It's your ward of protection.

44:34.913 --> 44:37.546
It has to be your blood.

44:37.548 --> 44:40.085
I do it all the time without any ice.
Come on.

44:41.954 --> 44:43.787
Sophia,

44:43.789 --> 44:46.121
I know I'm an awkward freak.

44:46.123 --> 44:48.657
I know no one likes me.

44:48.659 --> 44:51.661
I know that everything
I do looks crazy.

44:51.663 --> 44:54.264
But this will protect you
when I'm not around.

44:54.266 --> 44:57.202
And I'd feel better
knowing that you're safe.

44:59.804 --> 45:01.039
Trust me.

45:06.210 --> 45:09.548
Look into my eyes and say this:

45:10.282 --> 45:13.986
Thurisaz. The Thorn. The Hammer.

45:16.054 --> 45:18.889
Thurisaz. The Thorn. The Hammer.

45:18.891 --> 45:20.724
Take the force of my enemy

45:20.726 --> 45:23.959
and send it back to him
a thousand thousand times.

45:23.961 --> 45:27.967
Take the force of my enemy and send it
o him a thousand thousand times.

45:30.969 --> 45:32.836
Are you gonna do it?

45:32.838 --> 45:34.606
d it when you looked in my eyes.

45:49.721 --> 45:50.789
Thank you.

45:58.297 --> 46:01.030
<i>here's a high drive, left field,
well hit!</i>

46:01.032 --> 46:03.833
<i>Back there, it is... a home run!</i>

46:08.873 --> 46:11.273
<i>It's a long fly ball...</i>

46:11.275 --> 46:13.278
Barbara!

46:15.146 --> 46:16.516
Barbara?

46:21.619 --> 46:22.587
Barbara?

46:25.157 --> 46:28.059
I can hear your tapes
in the whole house.

46:32.630 --> 46:34.664
I have to be up early tomorrow.

46:34.666 --> 46:38.001
I sure do!
High finance is a man's world,

46:38.003 --> 46:41.737
I don't let anything get me down
because I have gumption!

46:41.739 --> 46:44.273
chew gumption after every meal!

46:44.275 --> 46:46.675
Stinky! Beloved cubicle-mate.

46:46.677 --> 46:50.179
e I told you if you only smelled
like butt dipped in tuna

46:50.181 --> 46:52.182
that would be an improvement?

46:52.184 --> 46:54.617
hink Stinky needs to get to bed.

46:54.619 --> 46:56.686
Luckily I, Glorious Guggenheim,

46:56.688 --> 47:01.023
save you from a life of drudgery
and olfactory assault with...

47:01.025 --> 47:02.391
a promotion!

47:02.393 --> 47:07.363
ank you so much, Mr. Guggenheim!

47:07.365 --> 47:09.699
It's very nice of you.

47:09.701 --> 47:11.704
t I don't need a pity promotion.

47:13.070 --> 47:16.005
I'm gonna figure this out.

47:16.007 --> 47:18.941
That's the smartest thing
you've ever said, big Karen.

47:18.943 --> 47:20.679
Thank you, little Karen.

47:23.815 --> 47:27.186
Perhaps I should talk
to my little sister more too.

47:49.940 --> 47:52.110
I'm trying, Barbara.

48:40.358 --> 48:42.193
I wanna try something new.

48:43.728 --> 48:44.329
A game.

48:48.800 --> 48:53.036
People play too many games.
Let's just keep it honest.

48:53.038 --> 48:53.905
Okay.

48:55.072 --> 48:56.873
Honestly?

48:56.875 --> 48:59.409
I put my neck on the line
to keep you out of suspension

48:59.411 --> 49:01.713
your little stunt in gym class.

49:05.416 --> 49:07.316
It's a word game.

49:07.318 --> 49:09.889
I say a word
and you say a word back, okay?

49:11.822 --> 49:13.458
Like... game.

49:14.793 --> 49:16.191
No!

49:16.193 --> 49:18.329
I... lose.

49:20.231 --> 49:21.363
Diamond.

49:21.365 --> 49:22.798
Fake.

49:22.800 --> 49:24.133
Mrs. Mollé,

49:24.135 --> 49:25.938
gs are happening. I have to go...
- Baseball.

49:35.847 --> 49:36.816
Baseball.

49:47.192 --> 49:48.360
Baseball.

49:56.300 --> 49:57.402
Barbara...

49:58.235 --> 49:59.836
You're holding my hand.

49:59.838 --> 50:01.104
It's okay.

50:01.106 --> 50:02.539
I'm your friend.

50:02.541 --> 50:05.941
Someone you can talk to
if you're having problems.

50:05.943 --> 50:09.278
- I have to go to the bathroom...
- Like if you're... angry,

50:09.280 --> 50:11.113
if you're... afraid.

50:11.115 --> 50:13.115
- Please let me go.
- What's making you sad...

50:13.117 --> 50:15.284
- Please let me go.
- Like what's going on at home.

50:19.257 --> 50:21.527
With Karen and Dave...

50:41.278 --> 50:44.146
<i>Kinarus, kinarus</i>

50:50.054 --> 50:51.854
<i>Coveleski...</i>

50:51.856 --> 50:53.990
<i>Weapons of great renown
have to have a name.</i>

50:53.992 --> 50:55.258
<i>Barbara...</i>

50:55.260 --> 50:57.293
<i>A game.</i>

50:57.295 --> 50:59.561
<i>I say a word
and you say a word back.</i>

50:59.563 --> 51:00.863
<i>Barbara...</i>

51:03.467 --> 51:05.334
<i>Baseball.</i>

51:05.336 --> 51:07.470
<i>Harry Coveleski...</i>

51:07.472 --> 51:10.273
<i>Coveleski was a baseball player,</i>

51:10.275 --> 51:11.507
<i>a rookie</i>

51:11.509 --> 51:13.376
<i>for the Philadelphia Phillies.</i>

51:13.378 --> 51:17.280
<i>That's some obscure
baseball history, Thorson.</i>

51:17.282 --> 51:20.052
<i>any Phillies fans in the family?</i>

51:28.960 --> 51:30.025
Sophia!

51:30.027 --> 51:31.260
Nice one, psycho.

51:31.262 --> 51:33.996
- I'm sorry! I didn't...
- She's a total psycho.

51:33.998 --> 51:35.565
Sophia!

51:35.567 --> 51:36.902
Please...

52:03.427 --> 52:04.661
Sorry dinner's late.

52:04.663 --> 52:06.528
Sorry dinner's gonna suck.

52:06.530 --> 52:08.331
coast guard. The red tide's in.

52:08.333 --> 52:10.066
I had to kiss ass and stay late

52:10.068 --> 52:12.501
because my day got derailed
by a phone call.

52:12.503 --> 52:14.369
We all had issues today.

52:14.371 --> 52:17.643
- I'm trying to move forward.
- You hit a goddamn teacher!

52:21.478 --> 52:23.713
I would never hit a teacher.

52:23.715 --> 52:26.983
They don't get paid enough
for that abuse.

52:26.985 --> 52:30.052
- She's a psychologist.
- Are you freaking mental?

52:30.054 --> 52:31.287
Ouch!

52:31.289 --> 52:32.658
Son of a bitch!

52:38.496 --> 52:40.164
I can't do this.

52:42.599 --> 52:44.435
How can I do this by myself?

52:46.271 --> 52:48.140
You two won't grow up and help me.

52:49.407 --> 52:52.641
I can't deal with you going crazy!

52:52.643 --> 52:57.646
If you act out, they call me at work
and I have to deal with your shit.

52:57.648 --> 53:02.284
And it's a problem for me because
I'm trying my best to hold it all together.

53:02.286 --> 53:04.686
bara. This is not fair, Barbara!

53:04.688 --> 53:07.590
Hey, this is not fair!

53:07.592 --> 53:09.726
- You're not running away!
- Yes, I am!

53:09.728 --> 53:12.195
No, you're not!
Why are you fighting me?

53:12.197 --> 53:14.262
I'm trying to help you.
So is the shrink!

53:14.264 --> 53:17.200
If you want to fight somebody,
stand up to that bully at school!

53:17.202 --> 53:20.436
Says the whiney doormat
who can't talk to her own boss!

53:20.438 --> 53:23.438
You have <i>no</i> idea
what I've given up for you.

53:23.440 --> 53:25.176
Neither do you!

53:55.472 --> 53:58.043
She's crazy,
but she knows how to punch.

53:59.710 --> 54:02.180
It... was an accident.

54:04.081 --> 54:06.484
t did not look like an accident.

54:07.585 --> 54:09.188
She's my friend.

54:10.454 --> 54:12.688
Shouldn't be.

54:12.690 --> 54:15.027
<i>People will talk about you too.</i>

54:15.726 --> 54:17.659
<i>Besides,</i>

54:17.661 --> 54:20.429
<i>crazy people can't have friends.</i>

54:20.431 --> 54:22.465
<i>It's part of their sickness.</i>

54:22.467 --> 54:24.099
<i>I get it.</i>

54:24.101 --> 54:26.068
<i>You're a nice kid.</i>

54:26.070 --> 54:28.637
<i>You want to help her,
like a dog with a broken leg.</i>

54:28.639 --> 54:31.074
<i>only way to help a crazy person</i>

54:31.076 --> 54:33.575
<i>is to expose their sickness.</i>

54:33.577 --> 54:36.079
<i>'ve seen her crazy stuff, right?</i>

54:36.081 --> 54:38.347
<i>I bet she showed you her traps</i>

54:38.349 --> 54:40.019
<i>and weird shit!</i>

54:42.253 --> 54:43.188
<i>I like you.</i>

54:44.489 --> 54:46.722
<i>You're pretty.</i>

54:46.724 --> 54:50.258
<i>You could be cool.
I'll make you a deal.</i>

54:50.260 --> 54:52.264
<i>ll me some of the crazy stuff...</i>

54:54.164 --> 54:56.101
and I'll tell you a secret

54:57.302 --> 54:59.204
about your friend.

55:10.514 --> 55:12.050
Close the door, please.

55:22.427 --> 55:24.063
Tell me about giants.

55:26.563 --> 55:28.299
How come I'm not expelled?

55:29.701 --> 55:32.135
I know you called Karen.

55:32.137 --> 55:34.740
People in New Jersey
know you called Karen.

55:36.608 --> 55:38.610
Why didn't you tell the principal?

55:40.311 --> 55:42.081
Everyone gets one.

55:42.679 --> 55:44.582
I can excuse one.

55:46.550 --> 55:47.619
Do I need to expand?

55:56.628 --> 55:58.697
Why do giants have to die?

56:00.398 --> 56:03.302
Looking at them,
they look pretty silly to me.

56:04.434 --> 56:06.769
If I remember, Mickey Mouse

56:06.771 --> 56:09.371
beat giants twice

56:09.373 --> 56:10.875
with no problem.

56:12.744 --> 56:15.211
Those are so stupid!

56:15.213 --> 56:16.215
God!

56:19.483 --> 56:22.684
A giant comes to a place...

56:22.686 --> 56:25.356
destroys everything in its path.

56:27.559 --> 56:29.228
Worse than that.

56:30.427 --> 56:32.864
It's not like a dumb cartoon
or something.

56:34.766 --> 56:36.235
A giant...

56:42.239 --> 56:43.375
What?

56:44.474 --> 56:45.941
A giant...

56:45.943 --> 56:47.813
is hate.

56:50.681 --> 56:52.783
Smashing stuff isn't enough.

56:55.786 --> 56:57.788
A giant takes.

56:59.657 --> 57:01.793
It takes everything from you.

57:03.827 --> 57:05.730
And when it's done...

57:07.565 --> 57:10.668
It's like anything
that made your life good

57:11.668 --> 57:13.739
was never even there.

57:21.545 --> 57:22.947
It's horrible.

57:28.286 --> 57:29.188
Barbara...

57:31.688 --> 57:33.257
are you afraid of giants?

57:37.561 --> 57:38.496
No.

57:40.965 --> 57:43.633
I'm not afraid of them.

57:43.635 --> 57:45.704
Because I have Coveleski.

57:48.039 --> 57:50.375
With this I can stop it.

57:51.309 --> 57:53.445
If I'm strong enough.

57:54.045 --> 57:56.378
If I stay focused.

57:56.380 --> 57:57.815
If I'm worthy...

58:00.550 --> 58:02.721
I can stop death itself.

58:12.730 --> 58:14.865
Coveleski sounds very special.

58:16.000 --> 58:17.465
May I see it?

58:17.467 --> 58:18.867
After school!

58:18.869 --> 58:20.735
No!

58:20.737 --> 58:23.541
- I'll show you then.
- Now is perfect.

58:27.911 --> 58:31.315
What's going to happen?
Barbara, please stay!

58:32.483 --> 58:34.483
Damn it.

58:34.485 --> 58:37.787
Look at all this crap!
I told you.

58:37.789 --> 58:40.655
Giant traps. What a freak!

58:40.657 --> 58:43.092
ilarious. Can we burn this shit?

58:47.632 --> 58:49.501
Stop it, Taylor!

58:52.603 --> 58:53.668
Stop it

58:53.670 --> 58:55.406
or I'm going to kill you.

58:56.474 --> 58:59.641
She told us about your stupid junk here.

58:59.643 --> 59:03.047
She knows
you're a messed up psycho.

59:04.014 --> 59:06.050
You gonna kill her too?

59:06.951 --> 59:08.784
She'll get hers.

59:08.786 --> 59:10.920
You said you wouldn't touch it.

59:10.922 --> 59:12.391
Worry about yourself.

59:13.891 --> 59:15.527
Coveleski is about to speak.

59:16.994 --> 59:18.864
Come on. She's nothing.

59:40.818 --> 59:42.621
What happened to it?

59:48.826 --> 59:51.496
I'm sorry!
Fight back!

59:52.028 --> 59:53.498
Sorry!

59:57.668 --> 59:59.104
Barbara!

01:01:15.612 --> 01:01:19.914
Sophia...
Why did you bring me upstairs?

01:01:19.916 --> 01:01:22.052
We never go upstairs!

01:01:26.090 --> 01:01:27.559
Come here!

01:01:27.958 --> 01:01:29.557
Slowly.

01:01:29.559 --> 01:01:31.092
Please!

01:01:31.094 --> 01:01:32.563
Don't let it see you.

01:01:40.103 --> 01:01:41.639
Sophia!

01:02:51.976 --> 01:02:54.012
- Mrs. Mollé!
- Barbara?

01:02:55.846 --> 01:02:57.713
I'm sorry.

01:02:57.715 --> 01:03:01.583
niffling) It's the 21st century.
yone knows where everyone lives.

01:03:01.585 --> 01:03:03.885
What happened to you?

01:03:03.887 --> 01:03:05.287
Something's wrong with me.

01:03:05.289 --> 01:03:08.057
No, honey.
There's nothing wrong with you.

01:03:08.059 --> 01:03:10.291
There she is!

01:03:10.293 --> 01:03:12.661
We're so happy Mommy's home, aren't we?

01:03:12.663 --> 01:03:15.930
- Just one second.
- We've been crying for an hour.

01:03:15.932 --> 01:03:17.633
My gosh.

01:03:17.635 --> 01:03:21.003
Momma's here, Momma's here...

01:03:21.005 --> 01:03:23.871
Momma's here. It's okay.

01:03:23.873 --> 01:03:25.776
You picked up a stray?

01:03:28.112 --> 01:03:30.813
This is my friend, Barbara.

01:03:30.815 --> 01:03:32.313
Hey.

01:03:32.315 --> 01:03:34.115
Barbara, this is my husband

01:03:34.117 --> 01:03:36.651
and here is

01:03:36.653 --> 01:03:40.155
the reason why I've been tired
all the time.

01:03:40.157 --> 01:03:45.193
Her name is Jacqueline,
own as Mrs. Fussy Colicky Pants.

01:03:45.195 --> 01:03:46.628
Yeah.

01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:48.630
She's doing better.

01:03:48.632 --> 01:03:50.932
She's going to die.

01:03:50.934 --> 01:03:52.900
- What did she say?
- No, it's fine.

01:03:52.902 --> 01:03:54.637
Everyone's going to die.

01:03:54.639 --> 01:03:56.240
Do you want to come inside?

01:03:57.675 --> 01:04:00.075
Wait, Barbara.
Barbara, come inside!

01:04:00.077 --> 01:04:01.279
Barbara!

01:04:48.125 --> 01:04:51.396
"Under the Stars"

01:06:12.041 --> 01:06:13.877
Where are you?

01:06:18.081 --> 01:06:19.817
Come fight me!

01:06:44.208 --> 01:06:46.244
Let me call you right back.

01:06:53.851 --> 01:06:54.519
Karen?

01:06:55.885 --> 01:06:57.519
<i>It's just not possible</i>

01:06:57.521 --> 01:07:00.389
Because I put her on the bus myself
every day.

01:07:00.391 --> 01:07:03.391
Not the last few days, apparently.

01:07:03.393 --> 01:07:05.126
I have to leave before the bus,

01:07:05.128 --> 01:07:08.130
but I pack her goddamn book bag
and make breakfast.

01:07:08.132 --> 01:07:11.066
I've left messages, Ms. Thorson.

01:07:11.068 --> 01:07:15.503
A lot of the time I just leave
out cereal and milk. Or...

01:07:15.505 --> 01:07:17.274
I don't...

01:07:18.509 --> 01:07:20.909
I think yesterday Dave

01:07:20.911 --> 01:07:23.548
ate left over chicken surprise.

01:07:34.425 --> 01:07:37.862
It's all falling apart.
I'm falling apart.

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:45.936
You've done the best you can.

01:08:46.261 --> 01:08:47.899
Coveleski.

01:09:00.210 --> 01:09:02.243
<i>In 1908,</i>

01:09:02.246 --> 01:09:05.580
<i>Coveleski, a left-handed rookie
m the coal mines of Pennsylvania</i>

01:09:05.582 --> 01:09:08.250
<i>hrust into the spotlight when...</i>

01:09:08.252 --> 01:09:11.118
<i>The pitcher was called
to the mound by the Phillies</i>

01:09:11.121 --> 01:09:15.389
<i>to do battle against
the unstoppable New York Giants.</i>

01:09:15.390 --> 01:09:17.291
<i>At only twenty-one,</i>

01:09:17.292 --> 01:09:21.129
<i>Coveleski stunned the nation.
He decimated the Giants' lineup</i>

01:09:21.131 --> 01:09:24.366
- <i>three times in five days...</i>
<i>- Mom, let me do this part!</i>

01:09:24.368 --> 01:09:28.236
<i>Coveleski's story captured
hearts of fans across the nation,</i>

01:09:28.238 --> 01:09:31.639
<i>earning him the nickname
The Giant Killer.</i>

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:33.274
The Giant Killer.

01:09:33.277 --> 01:09:36.477
<i>See, you never give up, Barbara.</i>

01:09:36.479 --> 01:09:38.714
<i>h I could have seen those games.</i>

01:09:38.716 --> 01:09:42.420
<i>But then you'd be old.</i>

01:10:14.752 --> 01:10:17.689
anny said I could use the table.

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.262
Why weren't you at school?

01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:31.032
Do you know
what a meme of malcontent is?

01:10:31.034 --> 01:10:34.468
It's when someone can think a name
and send a person to hell,

01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:38.608
where their skin is cooked off
and made into pies for demons.

01:10:40.444 --> 01:10:42.146
I'm meme-ing you right now.

01:10:54.524 --> 01:10:57.325
I brought Mrs. Mollé to your house.

01:10:57.327 --> 01:11:00.227
- You're scaring us, Barbara...
- I'm scaring you?

01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:03.732
When bloody parts of people
fall out of the sky

01:11:03.734 --> 01:11:05.666
and all you can see is red,

01:11:05.668 --> 01:11:09.170
then you'll be scared.
And it'll be your fault.

01:11:09.172 --> 01:11:11.072
You betrayed me!

01:11:11.074 --> 01:11:13.708
Coveleski is broken!

01:11:13.710 --> 01:11:17.015
Because of you
your bony-assed friend, Taylor!

01:11:17.648 --> 01:11:20.248
Without it I'm nothing.

01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:23.718
I won't be able to stop the giant...
- There is no giant! Just stop!

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:25.219
I trusted you!

01:11:25.221 --> 01:11:26.754
n why didn't you tell me about...

01:11:43.539 --> 01:11:45.076
Stupid!

01:11:47.543 --> 01:11:48.746
Pathetic.

01:11:49.813 --> 01:11:52.280
Weaker than before,

01:11:52.282 --> 01:11:55.552
playing your game
as the giant draws near.

01:12:01.824 --> 01:12:03.692
We waste our time.

01:12:03.694 --> 01:12:06.628
She have no spirit for this. Lost.

01:12:06.630 --> 01:12:08.162
Confused.

01:12:08.164 --> 01:12:09.598
Friendless.

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:13.567
When the giant finds you,
you will find yourself alone

01:12:13.569 --> 01:12:14.736
and quivering.

01:12:14.738 --> 01:12:15.870
Prove yourself.

01:12:15.872 --> 01:12:17.805
Prove yourself. Now!

01:12:17.807 --> 01:12:20.645
It's waiting at the edge of the forest.

01:15:06.710 --> 01:15:08.410
What did you do?

01:15:08.412 --> 01:15:11.012
saved you and every other idiot
in this stupid town.

01:15:11.014 --> 01:15:13.417
But tell me again I'm crazy.

01:15:44.381 --> 01:15:46.915
<i>I've kept my solemn oath.</i>

01:15:46.917 --> 01:15:48.782
<i>I've kept the darkness</i>

01:15:48.784 --> 01:15:50.751
<i>at bay.</i>

01:15:50.753 --> 01:15:53.754
<i>I have shown my worth.</i>

01:15:53.756 --> 01:15:57.861
<i>Please return Coveleski to me.</i>

01:16:15.679 --> 01:16:17.579
<i>On Doppler radar,</i>

01:16:17.581 --> 01:16:20.882
<i>we see a rapidly developing front
along the Jersey coastline.</i>

01:16:20.884 --> 01:16:24.451
<i>Very rare for this time of year
and surprisingly powerful.</i>

01:16:24.453 --> 01:16:25.853
Barbara?

01:16:25.855 --> 01:16:28.455
<i>Three hours ago, we forecasted
a sunny weekend, and now...</i>

01:16:28.457 --> 01:16:29.491
Barbara?

01:16:29.493 --> 01:16:31.558
<i>Practically out of nowhere.</i>

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:34.963
<i>Some counties in Southern New York
are issuing tornado warnings.</i>

01:16:34.965 --> 01:16:37.635
<i>I highly doubt we're gonna see that...</i>

01:16:47.109 --> 01:16:49.576
- <i>Hello?</i>
- <i>Karen? Hi.</i>

01:16:49.578 --> 01:16:52.746
<i>Hi, it's Mrs. Mollé.
Is Barbara with you?</i>

01:16:52.748 --> 01:16:55.482
<i>No, she didn't go to school?</i>

01:16:55.484 --> 01:16:59.987
<i>She came to school, yes. But...
There was an incident with Taylor.</i>

01:16:59.989 --> 01:17:01.856
<i>What, another fight?</i>

01:17:01.858 --> 01:17:03.590
<i>No, something else.</i>

01:17:03.592 --> 01:17:06.593
<i>Barbara went after Taylor.
It was very upsetting.</i>

01:17:06.595 --> 01:17:08.463
<i>The details don't matter now.</i>

01:17:08.465 --> 01:17:11.732
<i>I just want to make sure
that Barbara's okay.</i>

01:17:11.734 --> 01:17:15.102
<i>Elder spirits,
I have killed the giant</i>

01:17:15.104 --> 01:17:17.438
<i>and set my house in order.</i>

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:20.443
Please. Give it back.

01:17:29.886 --> 01:17:32.019
You ok?

01:17:32.021 --> 01:17:34.822
- Taylor?
- I'm gonna kill that bitch!

01:17:34.824 --> 01:17:36.894
Taylor! Get back here, now.

01:17:44.533 --> 01:17:46.233
<i>Attention, students...</i>

01:17:46.235 --> 01:17:47.570
Stop!

01:17:48.805 --> 01:17:50.039
Barbara!

01:17:51.908 --> 01:17:55.512
<i>gather your things and report to...</i>

01:18:18.868 --> 01:18:19.737
Barbara!

01:18:23.539 --> 01:18:25.072
Go home.

01:18:25.074 --> 01:18:28.809
Go hug your... family.

01:18:28.811 --> 01:18:32.045
I thought it was over,
but something's wrong.

01:18:32.047 --> 01:18:35.583
hought I could sacrifice Taylor,
but they need more.

01:18:35.585 --> 01:18:38.553
I didn't want to kill anything.
That's black magic.

01:18:38.555 --> 01:18:40.958
- This stuff is already dead.
- Barbara...

01:18:42.091 --> 01:18:44.161
Barbara, I went to your house.

01:18:49.231 --> 01:18:51.232
Go home, please.

01:18:51.234 --> 01:18:54.768
- Let me work!
- You work isn't real!

01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:57.104
Let's get in the car.
I'll take you home.

01:18:57.106 --> 01:18:59.741
You're not listening to me!

01:18:59.743 --> 01:19:01.843
Another giant is coming.

01:19:01.845 --> 01:19:05.280
If I don't fix Coveleski,
I can't kill it!

01:19:05.282 --> 01:19:06.650
Barbara.

01:19:07.817 --> 01:19:11.087
Your mother... wants to see you.

01:19:20.296 --> 01:19:22.765
Why are you acting weird?

01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:26.269
I don't...

01:19:29.672 --> 01:19:30.740
I don't have...

01:19:33.143 --> 01:19:36.110
- The giant...
- No! No!

01:19:36.112 --> 01:19:37.114
Okay?

01:19:38.047 --> 01:19:40.149
Your mother is sick.

01:19:41.016 --> 01:19:42.884
Do you understand?

01:19:42.886 --> 01:19:44.785
That's reality, Barbara.

01:19:44.787 --> 01:19:47.056
- And you have to face it.
- No!

01:19:48.324 --> 01:19:49.760
Barbara!

01:20:01.770 --> 01:20:02.803
Stop it!

01:20:02.805 --> 01:20:03.972
I said stop!

01:20:03.974 --> 01:20:06.674
Shut up! She's not even your friend!

01:20:06.676 --> 01:20:08.546
That freak crossed the line!

01:20:09.279 --> 01:20:10.777
She's not a freak.

01:20:10.779 --> 01:20:13.147
Her mom is sick, okay?
Really sick!

01:20:13.149 --> 01:20:14.182
I am her friend!

01:20:14.184 --> 01:20:16.049
I don't give a shit.

01:20:16.051 --> 01:20:18.621
You can all die together.

01:20:48.917 --> 01:20:50.787
I hate you!

01:20:53.023 --> 01:20:54.824
I hate you!

01:20:57.092 --> 01:20:58.628
Barbara!

01:21:01.965 --> 01:21:03.231
What happened?

01:21:03.233 --> 01:21:04.831
I tried to stop her but...

01:21:04.833 --> 01:21:07.237
It's okay!
Come on, we have to get inside.

01:21:08.104 --> 01:21:09.340
My leg...

01:21:14.077 --> 01:21:15.442
What's happening?

01:21:15.444 --> 01:21:17.311
It's time.

01:21:17.313 --> 01:21:19.880
- Take cover.
- We have to get inside!

01:21:19.882 --> 01:21:23.050
Sophia... Please.

01:21:23.052 --> 01:21:25.119
If you can't run, hide.

01:21:25.121 --> 01:21:26.623
Now.

01:21:39.135 --> 01:21:40.337
Barbara!

01:22:17.372 --> 01:22:19.442
No... It's a titan.

01:23:12.194 --> 01:23:13.561
You can't have her!

01:23:13.563 --> 01:23:16.432
You can't have her, you hear me?

01:23:18.268 --> 01:23:21.438
You will not hurt my mother!

01:24:00.143 --> 01:24:01.811
I beat you.

01:24:03.279 --> 01:24:05.012
I beat you!

01:24:08.885 --> 01:24:12.956
My mom is going to live
because I beat you.

01:24:14.858 --> 01:24:17.491
She is going to live!

01:24:17.493 --> 01:24:20.294
Little warrior...

01:24:20.296 --> 01:24:23.496
you fought with honor.

01:24:23.498 --> 01:24:26.569
But I did not come for her.

01:24:28.037 --> 01:24:29.972
I came for you.

01:24:32.041 --> 01:24:34.945
I came... for you.

01:24:35.511 --> 01:24:37.447
But I beat you.

01:24:39.582 --> 01:24:41.385
I beat you.

01:24:43.453 --> 01:24:45.556
I know, child.

01:24:46.154 --> 01:24:47.490
I know.

01:24:55.664 --> 01:24:57.835
I can't save her?

01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:20.089
So finish it.

01:25:58.661 --> 01:26:02.263
<i>l things that live in this world</i>

01:26:02.265 --> 01:26:03.634
<i>die.</i>

01:26:06.970 --> 01:26:12.305
<i>This is why you must find joy
in the living,</i>

01:26:12.307 --> 01:26:15.241
<i>while the time is yours.</i>

01:26:15.243 --> 01:26:17.947
<i>And not fear the end.</i>

01:26:19.148 --> 01:26:21.549
<i>To deny this</i>

01:26:21.551 --> 01:26:23.954
<i>is to deny life.</i>

01:26:24.487 --> 01:26:26.053
<i>But...</i>

01:26:27.422 --> 01:26:29.225
<i>to embrace it.</i>

01:26:31.761 --> 01:26:34.464
<i>Can you embrace it?</i>

01:26:50.145 --> 01:26:51.544
Barbara!

01:27:06.662 --> 01:27:10.534
<i>You are stronger than you think.</i>

01:27:34.489 --> 01:27:37.223
: <i>Climatologists are dumbfounded
by the storm</i>

01:27:37.225 --> 01:27:39.326
<i>that ripped through Long Island.</i>

01:27:39.328 --> 01:27:43.196
<i>There've been no significant tornadoes
in this area for decades.</i>

01:27:43.198 --> 01:27:47.134
<i>Coditions to generate such a storm
are considered extremely rare.</i>

01:27:47.136 --> 01:27:51.071
<i>There were no warning signs
and nothing officials could do.</i>

01:27:51.073 --> 01:27:53.307
<i>Miraculously, despite the devastation,</i>

01:27:53.309 --> 01:27:57.180
<i>there were only minor injuries
and no casualties.</i>

01:30:06.408 --> 01:30:07.810
Mom?

01:30:10.779 --> 01:30:13.282
I'm scared to open my eyes.

01:30:15.650 --> 01:30:17.386
Am I dreaming?

01:30:20.389 --> 01:30:21.791
No, Mom.

01:30:22.490 --> 01:30:23.726
No.

01:30:27.596 --> 01:30:29.666
There was a big storm.

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:33.369
I heard it.

01:30:35.503 --> 01:30:37.373
Was it scary?

01:30:43.279 --> 01:30:44.381
No.

01:30:47.582 --> 01:30:49.885
I'm not scared of storms.

01:30:51.420 --> 01:30:52.956
Neither am I.

01:30:53.689 --> 01:30:55.755
They can be...

01:30:55.757 --> 01:30:57.961
They can be sort of beautiful.

01:30:59.694 --> 01:31:01.463
And then afterwards,

01:31:03.966 --> 01:31:05.969
it's so quiet.

01:31:22.784 --> 01:31:25.255
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- Shh.

01:31:29.324 --> 01:31:32.393
I am sorry I was scared to see you.

01:31:32.395 --> 01:31:33.693
Hush...

01:31:33.695 --> 01:31:35.332
Hush, now.

01:32:16.005 --> 01:32:17.771
Let's get right to it!

01:32:17.773 --> 01:32:20.777
Who wants to tell me
something they did this summer?

01:32:22.478 --> 01:32:25.414
Alright, I'll pick a brave volunteer.

01:32:26.916 --> 01:32:28.583
Barbara Thorson?

01:32:32.654 --> 01:32:35.089
My break wasn't very interesting.

01:32:35.091 --> 01:32:36.924
I needed a lot of rest, so...

01:32:36.926 --> 01:32:40.363
I ate, slept, played.

01:32:40.996 --> 01:32:42.562
Hung out with my mom.

01:32:42.564 --> 01:32:44.998
She also killed a Titan
with her bare hands!

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.433
I mean, technically,
that was before the holidays.

01:32:47.435 --> 01:32:50.036
And she used a hammer.
But she did that too.

01:32:50.038 --> 01:32:52.039
Um, right.

01:32:52.041 --> 01:32:54.844
Okay... Anybody else?

01:32:57.712 --> 01:32:58.881
Barbara.

01:33:04.854 --> 01:33:06.519
Is it time?

01:33:06.521 --> 01:33:08.824
Karen's on her way.
The doctor says it's soon.

01:33:16.564 --> 01:33:18.434
Are you afraid?

01:33:21.103 --> 01:33:23.539
There's nothing to be afraid of.

01:33:41.524 --> 01:33:42.592
Okay.

01:33:43.993 --> 01:33:45.595
Are you ready?

01:33:47.863 --> 01:33:51.434
"A Glimpse of a Time"

01:36:44.806 --> 01:36:46.373
Thank you.

01:36:54.248 --> 01:36:55.751
I'm all right.

01:36:59.954 --> 01:37:01.791
We're all going to be all right.

01:37:06.095 --> 01:37:08.264
We're stronger than we think.
