00:06.982 --> 00:08.934
- <i>Last time on "Superstition"...</i>
- What are you?

00:08.998 --> 00:11.680
<i>The destroyer of worlds. The Dredge.</i>

00:11.705 --> 00:12.974
The Dredge has marked
your family for death.

00:13.006 --> 00:14.187
I need to protect my family.

00:14.212 --> 00:15.973
You'll teach me everything.

00:16.073 --> 00:19.338
You built a wedge
between me and my mother.

00:19.394 --> 00:20.631
I wanna understand your powers.

00:20.664 --> 00:21.838
Russ.

00:21.878 --> 00:24.021
- Just tell me what to do.
- Who'd you make this deal with?

00:24.046 --> 00:26.465
<i>One day soon I will demand repayment.</i>

<i>Calvin, son of Rozan.</i>

00:54.111 --> 00:55.711
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

01:11.611 --> 01:14.962
Everything just feels a little off.

01:15.049 --> 01:16.078
Hard to explain.

01:16.178 --> 01:18.044
Hard or embarrassing? Which one?

01:18.199 --> 01:19.599
You trying to psychoanalyze me now?

01:19.624 --> 01:22.511
No. I'm just saying you're acting like
someone with something to hide.

01:22.844 --> 01:24.483
I'm guessing you came here
because you wanted to talk.

01:24.508 --> 01:26.407
I'm with that, but I just wish
you would've called first.

01:26.455 --> 01:28.116
But it's fine.

01:28.216 --> 01:29.850
I didn't mean to cramp your style.

01:29.950 --> 01:31.483
There's nobody else here, Calvin.

01:31.583 --> 01:33.516
We both know it's not about that.

01:33.616 --> 01:36.150
Okay, well, I've been
having trouble sleeping...

01:36.250 --> 01:37.750
- PTSD.
- ...and it's not PTSD.

01:37.850 --> 01:39.283
- Denial...
- It's not denial.

01:39.383 --> 01:40.916
Good. Good.

01:41.016 --> 01:43.350
Because denying denial
would be just wrong, right?

01:45.244 --> 01:46.443
<i>We are stronger as one.</i>

01:46.521 --> 01:48.006
Because, Calvin, after everything

01:48.054 --> 01:50.850
I'm glad we can still talk, and be friends.
And you know, honestly,

01:51.228 --> 01:52.795
I've been having problems
sleeping myself.

01:53.314 --> 01:55.433
Well, we both know
what that is, don't we?

01:55.512 --> 01:56.583
Hmm.

01:58.050 --> 02:00.965
We need to stop running from each other.

02:00.996 --> 02:04.847
Start accepting the imperfections
of this thing called "life."

02:05.583 --> 02:07.550
I thought you agreed
to respect my wishes.

02:07.650 --> 02:08.799
- True.
- Sure.

02:08.847 --> 02:14.169
But, maybe what we both
need to help us sleep is...

02:14.316 --> 02:16.391
Less emotional and more biological.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.483
Okay, yeah. I've been there,
done that. I'm good.

02:20.637 --> 02:22.582
- Okay.
- Good.

02:22.685 --> 02:24.648
You said we are both alone here, right?

02:24.744 --> 02:27.053
You're really acting way creepier

02:27.117 --> 02:28.831
than your usual, Calvin. All right?

02:28.894 --> 02:30.527
- Let's just...
- Hey.

02:31.016 --> 02:33.016
Okay. You know, maybe
you should get some rest.

02:33.116 --> 02:34.583
- You should just...
- Oh!

02:35.137 --> 02:36.670
Hey.

02:37.480 --> 02:38.947
There she is.

02:40.076 --> 02:42.876
- Calvin?
- I know what you smell like.

02:42.946 --> 02:45.176
I really think that you
need to just go home, okay?

02:45.201 --> 02:46.113
- Okay.
- Okay.

02:46.160 --> 02:48.465
- Just...
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:48.565 --> 02:50.498
I think first you have
something to show me.

02:50.598 --> 02:52.498
What do you have in here?

02:52.598 --> 02:54.298
Ooh!

02:54.398 --> 02:57.265
- I'm gonna enjoy taming you.
- Calvin...

02:57.365 --> 02:59.465
I do not want to hurt you, okay?

02:59.565 --> 03:00.798
Get off of me!

03:03.681 --> 03:05.232
Hey.

03:05.332 --> 03:06.765
Hey, guys.

03:06.865 --> 03:08.265
There she is.

03:09.732 --> 03:12.232
May, to be continued.

03:12.332 --> 03:14.432
I'll let myself out.

03:14.532 --> 03:15.965
And what was that about?

03:16.019 --> 03:17.146
Nothing. Nothing.

03:17.185 --> 03:19.798
An action packed conversation
with your father.

03:20.225 --> 03:21.662
God.

03:21.832 --> 03:23.898
Uh, I got both of the pies.
They're in the kitchen.

03:24.005 --> 03:26.272
So, you know, the taste challenge
is on if you're ready.

03:26.365 --> 03:28.841
Right, I, actually promised Russ
I'd head back over to his place.

03:28.936 --> 03:30.198
I just...

03:30.298 --> 03:32.298
- I can't seem to find my...
- Your phone.

03:32.398 --> 03:34.932
I was going to call you and
tell you it was here, but...

03:35.032 --> 03:36.998
- It was here.
- Thanks, Mom.

03:37.098 --> 03:38.532
- Yeah.
- Right?

03:38.632 --> 03:39.632
Mmm-hmm.

03:39.732 --> 03:40.878
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:40.925 --> 03:42.632
- Love you.
- I, I love you.

04:03.632 --> 04:05.965
I don't know. Something
was definitely going on.

04:06.065 --> 04:09.998
Well, maybe you interrupted
their sexy time.

04:10.098 --> 04:12.465
No. And I've been there, done that.

04:12.565 --> 04:13.898
This one was different. I mean...

04:13.998 --> 04:16.065
The touch was like the opposite of sexy.

04:16.165 --> 04:17.464
Calvin was being really weird.

04:17.565 --> 04:18.765
Well, what do you mean?

04:18.865 --> 04:22.326
He usually has two settings.
Really intense or really chilling.

04:22.351 --> 04:23.498
I don't know. This one was new.

04:23.598 --> 04:26.465
Well, maybe it's because, you know...

04:26.565 --> 04:28.698
I think, the older that couples get,

04:28.798 --> 04:30.532
they wanna fight more than they have sex.
You know what I'm saying?

04:30.632 --> 04:32.432
What? Why?

04:32.532 --> 04:35.398
Well, it's usually because
they're not having enough sex.

04:35.498 --> 04:37.765
So, let's make sure that
doesn't happen with us.

04:37.865 --> 04:39.435
Russ, we're not even having sex.

04:39.499 --> 04:41.932
I know, but I've been practicing.

04:42.032 --> 04:43.665
And that's a wrap.

04:44.798 --> 04:47.232
Come on, Garv. I was joking.

04:47.332 --> 04:50.632
Hold on, wait. Seriously, look.

04:50.732 --> 04:53.555
I wanted you to come by
to show you this.

04:55.098 --> 04:56.665
What is this?

04:56.765 --> 04:58.309
Well, it's just a little database I made

04:58.388 --> 05:00.498
to help out with the
infernal ass kickin' cause.

05:00.598 --> 05:02.798
See, based on the
information you've told me,

05:02.898 --> 05:05.598
some have sonic powers.
Like, they'll blow your ears out.

05:05.646 --> 05:07.098
Like the Herald, right?

05:07.202 --> 05:09.965
Oh, those are psychic mind
benders, like The Dredge,

05:10.065 --> 05:12.032
and others are just bad-ass strong guys.

05:13.198 --> 05:15.532
Russ, this is nice.
Does this leave any...

05:15.632 --> 05:18.032
Any breadcrumbs
across the Dark Web? Nah.

05:18.132 --> 05:19.905
I made sure it's not traceable.

05:19.998 --> 05:21.465
Okay.

05:21.565 --> 05:22.898
- Like it?
- It's not bad.

05:22.998 --> 05:23.965
Mmm-hmm.

05:24.065 --> 05:26.365
Oh, God. Another dinner.

05:26.465 --> 05:28.532
But another voter.

05:33.165 --> 05:34.198
Oh, no.

05:34.655 --> 05:37.189
You've got a second before
I call security, okay?

05:38.632 --> 05:40.098
I trust you can count to one.

05:43.332 --> 05:44.732
One.

05:50.998 --> 05:52.362
What the...

06:19.231 --> 06:20.798
He's been saying that
he's having a problem sleeping.

06:20.914 --> 06:23.197
Do you remember anything
out of the ordinary about him?

06:23.256 --> 06:26.022
Anything at all?
Big, small, I just need you to think.

06:26.598 --> 06:31.265
Well, he does like to stare off
into nothing a lot, you know?

06:31.365 --> 06:32.632
Comes in and out of the house
at all hours of the night,

06:32.732 --> 06:35.813
but, honestly, killing infernals
is not really a 9-to-5-er.

06:36.607 --> 06:39.465
Well, uh... Maybe he's not acting like
himself because he isn't.

06:40.898 --> 06:41.998
PTSD?

06:42.098 --> 06:43.965
Exactly.

06:44.065 --> 06:46.072
He experienced heavy combat
in Afghanistan.

06:46.135 --> 06:48.635
You know, 20% of veterans
from Afghanistan and Iraq

06:48.659 --> 06:50.672
suffer from PTSD and divorce.

06:50.728 --> 06:52.384
Insomnia is a common symptom.

06:52.451 --> 06:55.884
You know, the mood swings, the aggression.
It makes perfect sense.

06:55.984 --> 07:00.118
Wait a minute. You're also describing
the symptoms of onset possession.

07:01.351 --> 07:02.852
Onset who now?

07:02.916 --> 07:05.184
No, I know. I know what possession is.

07:05.284 --> 07:06.984
I just hadn't processed that.

07:07.047 --> 07:08.051
I've been living with
the Hastings long enough

07:08.111 --> 07:09.584
to know that anything is possible.

07:09.684 --> 07:11.722
I don't think that's what it is.

07:11.913 --> 07:14.226
But in the off chance that it
is something supernatural,

07:14.279 --> 07:17.035
I need your help. I need you
to keep an eye on him, please.

07:17.784 --> 07:20.151
Scan him with that infrared,
infernal finder...

07:20.251 --> 07:22.218
- Yeah, I got it.
- ...thing that you have. Yeah.

07:22.318 --> 07:24.351
You know, you could also just arrest him.
You're kind of a cop.

07:25.018 --> 07:26.651
Arrest him for what?

07:26.751 --> 07:27.918
I don't know. Plant something.

07:28.651 --> 07:30.418
Not funny.

07:30.518 --> 07:31.784
Woah, woah, what are you gonna do?

07:31.835 --> 07:34.584
I'm going to go find some answers
that are obviously not here.

07:42.256 --> 07:44.222
Calvin?

07:44.967 --> 07:46.733
- Calvin.
- Hey, stranger.

07:48.795 --> 07:49.962
Stranger.

07:50.055 --> 07:51.584
Much as I would love to believe

07:51.684 --> 07:53.948
that you came all the way
up here looking for me,

07:54.019 --> 07:57.638
I am observing our new
all-business rules apply.

07:57.741 --> 08:00.984
So you have an infernal
for me to handle?

08:01.084 --> 08:03.069
You are in a much better mood.

08:04.351 --> 08:05.973
Calvin, you attacked me.

08:07.518 --> 08:08.951
- What?
- You heard me.

08:10.061 --> 08:11.851
This is my first
time seeing you in days.

08:18.418 --> 08:19.818
- <i>Yeah, Mom. What's up?</i>
- Hey.

08:19.918 --> 08:22.184
Hey, when was the last time
you saw Calvin?

08:22.284 --> 08:24.618
<i>Earlier with you at home. Why?</i>

08:24.718 --> 08:26.657
No reason. See you later.

08:26.871 --> 08:28.871
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

08:29.551 --> 08:30.718
What happened?

08:32.183 --> 08:33.484
What did I do?

08:35.751 --> 08:37.518
Tell me.

08:37.618 --> 08:40.051
You wanted me, and I wouldn't.

08:40.142 --> 08:41.942
And then Garvey walked in
and she interrupted.

08:42.051 --> 08:44.384
But I... I get it, you know.

08:44.484 --> 08:46.384
I understand. I knew in my heart
you wouldn't just do that.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.718
But something in me would.

08:48.818 --> 08:51.318
- And what if Garvey hadn't walked in?
- Shit, I'd have shot you.

08:53.584 --> 08:56.277
May, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

08:56.310 --> 08:57.544
Yeah.

08:59.251 --> 09:00.818
What can I do?

09:00.918 --> 09:02.651
I found this clinic,

09:02.751 --> 09:04.818
and they specialize in PTSD.

09:04.918 --> 09:06.740
The problem, May, is me.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.980
- It's not...
- I killed my brother.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.240
Wait. Whoa, there's way more
to that than just...

09:11.305 --> 09:13.813
You couple that with
what I did to my father.

09:13.913 --> 09:15.013
Calvin.

09:15.113 --> 09:18.013
The infernal that faced Arlo,

09:18.113 --> 09:20.347
- he said I had a dark soul.
- Okay, listen, listen.

09:20.416 --> 09:21.765
If this ring
is making you act like that,

09:21.829 --> 09:23.202
you need to just take it off.

09:23.264 --> 09:24.535
Might have started with the ring, but...

09:24.587 --> 09:26.670
But what? Now you think
it's infected you?

09:27.236 --> 09:28.400
- Just take it off.
- I cannot.

09:28.488 --> 09:30.080
- You can. Just take...
- I cannot take it off!

09:30.180 --> 09:32.380
What if Isaac puts this ring on?

09:32.488 --> 09:34.488
And he is immortal.
He could wipe out the planet.

09:34.580 --> 09:36.547
No, I need to deal with this myself.

09:36.591 --> 09:38.780
- I cannot be a risk to the family
- Whoa, whoa,

09:38.863 --> 09:40.311
- and to you.
- Calvin.

09:40.359 --> 09:42.248
What are you saying right now?

09:43.813 --> 09:48.373
That I need to huddle with Isaac.

09:50.313 --> 09:52.847
We're gonna get in the Alchemy room

09:52.947 --> 09:54.947
and figure out a way to take care of it.

09:56.613 --> 09:58.031
It's what we do.

10:00.680 --> 10:01.913
I'm so sorry.

10:13.347 --> 10:17.158
Whoa, we got us
a diamond cutter right here.

10:18.080 --> 10:21.280
Man, you captured every
branch in that rune, son.

10:23.647 --> 10:24.947
Learned from the best.

10:25.047 --> 10:27.680
No, you better than me now, boy.

10:27.780 --> 10:30.317
I'm not sure how I feel about that.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.277
I mean, you got you a
powerful bullet right there.

10:33.680 --> 10:36.380
Most runes take out an infernal,

10:36.480 --> 10:38.947
maybe a human, but this here...

10:39.047 --> 10:41.713
This will take out whatever
it comes in contact with,

10:41.813 --> 10:43.613
clothes, jewelry, everything.

10:44.447 --> 10:45.480
Hmm.

10:48.147 --> 10:49.813
A nuke in a bullet.

10:50.813 --> 10:52.560
Nuke in a bullet.

10:53.347 --> 10:54.447
Yeah.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.647
So, why are you making it?

10:56.747 --> 10:58.180
Wanted the carving challenge.

10:59.213 --> 11:00.180
Plus, like you always said,

11:00.280 --> 11:03.013
it's better to have a nuke
and not need it

11:03.113 --> 11:04.380
than need it and not have it.

11:06.613 --> 11:08.025
I never said that.

11:09.313 --> 11:11.880
You make me sound like
Kim Jong Il or some shit.

11:12.913 --> 11:16.246
Well, if you want it, it's yours.

11:16.613 --> 11:20.047
Pop, I know I've
complained a lot, but...

11:20.147 --> 11:23.247
Coming back here, being
with you and the family,

11:23.330 --> 11:25.091
I wouldn't trade it for anything.

11:27.747 --> 11:30.847
My daddy, your granddaddy,

11:30.947 --> 11:32.813
used to say to me back in the village,

11:32.913 --> 11:37.192
"Rozan, they are tomorrow people."

11:37.913 --> 11:40.213
People are focused on how
good things will be tomorrow.

11:40.313 --> 11:41.347
What am I gonna get done tomorrow?

11:41.408 --> 11:44.041
How much money or wealth
am I gonna have tomorrow?

11:45.213 --> 11:47.147
And then there are yesterday people.

11:47.247 --> 11:49.547
People that always look
backwards, focusing on the past.

11:49.647 --> 11:50.847
"We had a good time yesterday.

11:50.947 --> 11:53.147
"We were in a better shape yesterday.

11:53.247 --> 11:54.513
"We had fun yesterday."

11:55.947 --> 11:58.880
But very, very few today people.

12:01.013 --> 12:03.687
Most people don't know that right now...

12:04.313 --> 12:06.389
This moment is the gift.

12:09.747 --> 12:11.347
And that's why they call it the present.

12:12.947 --> 12:14.447
You just did that.

12:15.247 --> 12:16.313
Thank you for that.

12:17.713 --> 12:19.147
Where's that coming from?

12:19.247 --> 12:21.113
Sometimes things get lost
in the shuffle.

12:22.780 --> 12:24.080
Just thought you should know.

12:25.113 --> 12:26.480
Yes, they do.

12:31.713 --> 12:32.947
I'm proud of you.

12:34.147 --> 12:35.147
You okay?

12:37.343 --> 12:38.780
Never better.

12:47.880 --> 12:50.621
Uh, I mean, May filled me in...
It's just...

12:50.707 --> 12:52.620
I thought, um...

12:53.347 --> 12:56.280
You know, Pop and I, we're
getting close to finding a spell

12:56.327 --> 12:57.347
to wipe this whole thing out.

12:57.447 --> 12:59.113
- Good.
- It's looking good.

12:59.168 --> 13:00.913
Good, good, that's great.

13:02.147 --> 13:04.213
I'm sorry about everything.

13:04.313 --> 13:05.847
What? No, don't be.

13:06.713 --> 13:08.613
No trust has been broken here.

13:10.580 --> 13:12.513
Thanks for looking out for May, too.

13:14.147 --> 13:15.255
You know, you've helped hold

13:15.280 --> 13:17.180
this business and family together.

13:18.680 --> 13:20.313
I just wanted to let you know.

13:21.380 --> 13:23.047
I see you.

13:23.147 --> 13:24.513
And I love you for it.

13:25.713 --> 13:27.147
Like it or not,

13:29.047 --> 13:30.713
you've become a sister to me.

13:31.959 --> 13:34.025
Aw.

13:34.213 --> 13:36.601
Thank you, Calvin.
You're like a brother to me.

13:38.180 --> 13:40.916
Oh, careful. You know I'm a little...

13:41.495 --> 13:42.880
Bloody.

13:43.913 --> 13:45.147
But thank you.

13:50.280 --> 13:51.547
We'll hug later.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.813
Isaac, I thought you were supposed to be

14:28.913 --> 14:30.180
in the Alchemy room with Calvin.

14:30.280 --> 14:31.364
- Doing what?
- The spell.

14:31.428 --> 14:33.634
He said you guys were closing in on it.

14:33.680 --> 14:35.825
Nope. Not doing any spells.

14:35.904 --> 14:38.023
Okay. Well, then I think
Calvin is in trouble.

14:45.847 --> 14:48.013
Calvin is many
things, but he is a thinker.

14:48.113 --> 14:50.657
Whatever he's doing, he'd have a plan.

14:53.302 --> 14:56.713
What if his plan didn't
include getting help from us?

14:58.516 --> 15:00.513
Sounds like he's trying to protect us.

15:02.247 --> 15:03.706
<i>We have a deal.</i>

15:04.513 --> 15:06.992
No, we don't.

15:17.780 --> 15:19.047
Mr. Mayor.

15:21.047 --> 15:23.980
Why did you send your son to kill me?

15:24.080 --> 15:25.647
If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.

15:25.747 --> 15:27.172
He tried carving me up

15:27.847 --> 15:29.878
like a Thanksgiving turkey.

15:31.547 --> 15:34.147
Well, from the looks of things,
he didn't want you dead either.

15:34.247 --> 15:36.786
Against my better judgment,

15:37.280 --> 15:39.847
I decided to directly approach
the man behind the attack.

15:39.947 --> 15:42.221
But make no mistake...

15:42.421 --> 15:44.521
There are a lot of ways
I could have reacted.

15:44.661 --> 15:46.994
And those methods
are still on the table.

15:47.213 --> 15:48.713
I appreciate you coming to me,

15:50.880 --> 15:52.747
without starting a war.

15:53.980 --> 15:55.580
How'd you get past my gates?

15:57.413 --> 15:58.680
What?

15:58.780 --> 16:00.113
Tilly.

16:03.330 --> 16:06.430
- Uh, yeah?
- Go check on the wards, please.

16:06.648 --> 16:08.000
Will do.

16:13.247 --> 16:14.813
I still need to talk to your son.

16:16.180 --> 16:17.480
I'll talk to him first.

16:18.987 --> 16:20.387
If it's as you say,

16:20.717 --> 16:23.230
he'll come to you
and he'll make this right.

16:25.913 --> 16:26.947
Fair enough.

16:30.513 --> 16:31.547
Mr. Mayor.

16:33.116 --> 16:34.950
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

16:43.647 --> 16:47.213
The wards are gone, which means...

16:47.313 --> 16:49.213
The grounds, the graveyard...

16:51.380 --> 16:54.543
Even the house, it's all
vulnerable to infernal attack.

16:56.369 --> 16:58.102
Who would do such a thing?

17:00.080 --> 17:01.713
Maybe it's a what.

17:13.079 --> 17:14.313
Calvin...

17:14.413 --> 17:16.275
Where have you been, son?

17:16.393 --> 17:17.727
I want to talk to you.

17:18.273 --> 17:20.500
I was handling some things first.

17:24.776 --> 17:26.373
What kind of things?

17:27.047 --> 17:29.847
Things of a personal variety.

17:30.199 --> 17:31.937
Looks like some of those personal items

17:31.961 --> 17:33.841
are from our Alchemy room.

17:34.139 --> 17:37.072
- And why would that be?
- I could tell you.

17:39.813 --> 17:42.013
But then, it would spoil the surprise.

17:42.113 --> 17:43.647
I'm a big boy.

17:43.747 --> 17:45.136
It's not my birthday,

17:45.161 --> 17:46.813
I think I can handle the disappointment.

17:51.113 --> 17:53.145
Keep what's in the bag...

17:53.680 --> 17:55.347
It's time for me to wear the ring.

17:56.247 --> 17:57.380
Would you mind?

18:05.280 --> 18:07.313
Bet you didn't see that one
coming, did you?

18:07.370 --> 18:08.980
Calvin, you got to fight this...

18:09.080 --> 18:11.267
- I get to fight the immortal one,
- Son...

18:11.339 --> 18:13.021
known as the headless
wonder, from the body

18:13.077 --> 18:15.280
- of his own offspring.
- Calvin...

18:22.284 --> 18:23.403
Calvin!

18:23.506 --> 18:24.585
Calvin!

18:24.609 --> 18:25.745
Son!

18:27.313 --> 18:29.180
Pop? Pop?

18:29.280 --> 18:31.213
- I need...
- I know! I know!

18:31.313 --> 18:32.347
- I need...
- I know!

18:32.430 --> 18:34.513
You to get the hell off me.

18:38.813 --> 18:40.347
How does your son

18:40.447 --> 18:43.240
put up with all your
God-complex bullshit?

18:43.647 --> 18:44.747
With some difficulty.

18:59.647 --> 19:01.113
Right about now...

19:02.847 --> 19:04.347
Calvin's enjoying this.

19:04.447 --> 19:05.595
No, son.

19:11.113 --> 19:12.880
Calvin! Calvin!

19:12.905 --> 19:14.022
Son!

19:14.047 --> 19:15.613
Fight it!

19:15.642 --> 19:17.983
- Fight it!
- Shut up.

19:18.080 --> 19:19.580
You'll live.

19:24.526 --> 19:27.340
I don't know how long it takes you
to regenerate, so...

19:27.831 --> 19:29.780
Just to be on the safe side...

19:29.880 --> 19:31.747
I'm keeping some of this.

19:35.823 --> 19:37.190
This ain't goodbye.

19:40.313 --> 19:41.376
I had no idea

19:41.472 --> 19:43.329
how many different variations
of infernals there were.

19:43.380 --> 19:46.003
Yeah. And unlike humans,
they're not all created equal.

19:49.503 --> 19:51.270
- Hey, Calvin.
<i>- We've kept you</i>

19:51.295 --> 19:53.594
<i>at the kid's table long enough.
It's time to step up. You ready?</i>

19:53.951 --> 19:55.411
You don't have to get ready
if you're born ready.

19:55.451 --> 19:57.413
<i>Good. You sound ready enough to me.</i>

19:57.498 --> 19:59.547
<i>Now, meet me at the mouth
of the old cave</i>

19:59.594 --> 20:02.081
<i>in the woods just off the Exansus
and Carline road junction.</i>

20:02.129 --> 20:05.113
<i>And, Garvey, come alone. Trust no one.</i>

20:05.213 --> 20:06.480
Okay.

20:07.952 --> 20:10.619
That crossing's at
the edge of the woods.

20:10.847 --> 20:13.147
I could hear him through your phone.
He's bit of a loud talker.

20:13.247 --> 20:14.680
Let's go.

20:14.780 --> 20:16.480
Russ, we're not going anywhere.

20:16.580 --> 20:17.980
What?

20:18.070 --> 20:20.480
Is this because of the whole
"don't trust anyone" thing?

20:20.562 --> 20:22.743
He said that for everyone
outside the Hastings circle.

20:23.021 --> 20:25.313
- But I'm inside.
- Right.

20:25.640 --> 20:27.711
Ah... Seriously, when we
were in the clock zone,

20:27.777 --> 20:30.277
- I saved your life. Come on.
- Really?

20:30.513 --> 20:32.247
Okay. Almost.

20:32.347 --> 20:34.347
But I have kept every secret,
and never judged you.

20:34.447 --> 20:36.562
Garv, listen... Come on.

20:37.838 --> 20:39.038
Just let me drive you.

20:39.147 --> 20:40.673
Russ, forget it. Okay?

20:43.113 --> 20:44.840
I'm still coming.

20:44.912 --> 20:47.813
My brother's Jeep. I mean, he's super...

20:47.913 --> 20:50.047
- Okay. Stop. Stop!
- Okay, okay.

20:50.147 --> 20:52.047
I think I see some lights
over there, okay?

20:52.147 --> 20:55.483
- I'm gonna go, just stay here.
- Okay.

20:55.514 --> 20:56.983
I'll sit tight. Don't worry.

20:57.030 --> 20:59.570
But listen, if you or your old man
need me, just shoot me a text.

20:59.647 --> 21:00.880
I'm here for back up.

21:00.943 --> 21:03.970
- Seriously. I'm ready.
- Yeah.

21:18.813 --> 21:20.080
Oh, Calvin.

21:20.218 --> 21:21.480
Geez.

21:21.580 --> 21:23.347
That how you address your father?

21:23.983 --> 21:26.583
That shit ends today.
You will learn to respect

21:26.747 --> 21:27.950
and obey.

21:29.980 --> 21:32.480
- Have you been tainted?
- What?

21:33.380 --> 21:35.080
Are you a virgin?

21:36.147 --> 21:38.313
She better be.

21:38.813 --> 21:40.480
Russ.

21:43.947 --> 21:45.047
What's going on?

21:45.650 --> 21:47.173
You're perfect.

21:58.563 --> 22:00.113
No, no, no, no.

22:00.356 --> 22:02.094
How did The Dredge know
the body was there?

22:02.118 --> 22:03.133
'Cause Calvin knew.

22:03.158 --> 22:05.447
The Dredge was able to access
his mind somehow, obvi.

22:05.547 --> 22:06.729
The Dredge tricked his ass.

22:06.769 --> 22:08.396
Wait. So, if...
If he's in Calvin's mind,

22:08.443 --> 22:09.666
then that means
what happened to Dr. Kim,

22:09.705 --> 22:11.300
- is that what's gonna happen to Calvin?
- No, no.

22:11.364 --> 22:12.912
Dr. Kim was a host for The Dredge.

22:12.983 --> 22:14.047
He's not in Calvin's mind.

22:14.110 --> 22:15.309
Right now, he's trapped in the ring,

22:15.364 --> 22:17.247
and can only access
Calvin's mind from there.

22:17.317 --> 22:18.713
It's like a computer hacker,

22:18.753 --> 22:20.647
from a distance it could
take over your computer

22:20.698 --> 22:22.747
or air traffic control,
or shut down a dam,

22:22.846 --> 22:25.080
- or even cause a core meltdown...
- Tilly.

22:26.680 --> 22:28.608
Bottom line is this.

22:28.751 --> 22:31.913
The Dredge took that old
host body for a reason.

22:32.013 --> 22:33.980
Because no infernal can go
from being trapped

22:34.080 --> 22:36.280
in the Ring of Solomon,
which is a prison,

22:36.324 --> 22:38.587
to controlling the person
that wears the ring.

22:38.627 --> 22:39.675
Right.

22:39.713 --> 22:41.547
If he was fully possessing Calvin,

22:41.647 --> 22:43.694
he wouldn't need to steal the old host.

22:43.719 --> 22:44.716
That's right.

22:44.741 --> 22:46.472
You know, the ring should have a manual,

22:46.535 --> 22:48.900
or at least a downloadable PDF option.

22:49.813 --> 22:51.247
Tilly,

22:51.347 --> 22:53.147
what else is missing from the morgue?

22:53.247 --> 22:55.242
'Cause clearly my son
is building something.

22:55.322 --> 22:57.742
Let's see, there's some surgical
supplies, some clamps, tubes,

22:57.830 --> 22:58.942
chemical bottles...

22:59.187 --> 23:02.480
Oh, and my robe from
the downstairs bathroom.

23:02.580 --> 23:04.313
Truth time. I do get a little
too dirty to go upstairs.

23:04.413 --> 23:07.013
He attacked you,
but he left you alive. Why?

23:07.113 --> 23:08.480
Yeah.

23:08.580 --> 23:09.747
He wanted your blood.

23:09.847 --> 23:11.080
That's gotta be it.

23:11.180 --> 23:12.247
She's right.

23:12.347 --> 23:13.980
All right, everybody,

23:14.080 --> 23:17.113
start researching the
re-animation of dead infernals,

23:17.213 --> 23:19.113
and possible usages of their blood.

23:19.213 --> 23:20.847
Oh, got it! Over here.

23:20.947 --> 23:23.480
Okay. "The resurrection
of infernal hosts..."

23:23.580 --> 23:25.347
La-di-da... "Death and destruction..."

23:25.447 --> 23:26.822
Okay, here it is.

23:26.949 --> 23:28.547
So, among the needed elements,

23:28.647 --> 23:30.877
you need the blood
of an infernal, an immortal,

23:30.947 --> 23:33.203
- and a virgin.
- A virgin.

23:34.343 --> 23:35.780
Well, good luck finding
one of those in La Rochelle...

23:35.827 --> 23:37.486
Sh-sh-sh-shit!

23:39.547 --> 23:40.847
Garvey...

23:40.947 --> 23:42.213
Garvey, baby, I need you
to call me right back,

23:42.313 --> 23:44.246
as soon as you get this message.
This is not a game.

23:44.293 --> 23:46.813
This is a true emergency.
You call me right back.

23:47.680 --> 23:49.666
Okay.

23:49.746 --> 23:52.513
It says here, the spell will do more

23:52.613 --> 23:55.055
than just re-animate
The Dredge's first host.

23:55.413 --> 23:56.849
If completed...

23:57.747 --> 24:00.180
The body will become impervious

24:00.280 --> 24:01.551
to anything of this Earth.

24:04.543 --> 24:05.547
So, if the spell works

24:05.647 --> 24:08.747
and Dredge 1.0 becomes
invulnerable, then what?

24:08.847 --> 24:11.380
We throw everything we got at him.

24:11.480 --> 24:13.747
Even if it's just to slow his ass down.

24:13.847 --> 24:15.213
May.

24:15.487 --> 24:17.988
These have a more potent
form of rune on each bullet.

24:18.107 --> 24:19.613
Excuse me, pardon me.

24:19.679 --> 24:22.544
Hate to be the proverbial
turd in the punch bowl here,

24:22.845 --> 24:24.807
but there's been no
discussion about finding him.

24:24.947 --> 24:27.251
Okay, I'm sorry,
why is he with us again?

24:27.401 --> 24:29.180
Because I know The Dredge's weaknesses,

24:29.280 --> 24:31.013
and I just got cut.

24:31.113 --> 24:32.971
May.

24:33.067 --> 24:35.280
Nothing bonds people together
like the common enemy,

24:35.380 --> 24:36.680
and we got one now.

24:37.309 --> 24:38.776
So...

24:38.980 --> 24:40.685
This is a chance
we're gonna have to take.

24:44.749 --> 24:46.649
What about her?

24:47.849 --> 24:50.516
Oh, I deal with dead
infernals, not live ones.

24:51.471 --> 24:52.971
Damascus steel.

24:53.142 --> 24:55.042
- It will cut through anything.
- To that end,

24:55.097 --> 24:57.616
we are stronger
and more powerful united.

24:58.414 --> 25:00.319
We cannot afford to fail.

25:01.327 --> 25:04.383
All right. Tilly, you know
what we need from you.

25:04.684 --> 25:07.446
I dont't know, Isaac, it's
not like ordering a pizza.

25:07.541 --> 25:08.849
I get that.

25:08.949 --> 25:11.949
But desperate times
require desperate measures.

25:23.149 --> 25:25.549
We will get the whole
world ready to give!

25:25.649 --> 25:28.210
Drown the swamp, for real!

25:28.289 --> 25:29.932
Thank you for sending that, boy.

25:29.980 --> 25:32.283
Now the whole gang will be
here for the resurrection.

25:32.383 --> 25:34.449
Please, Dad, stop, don't hurt him.

25:35.950 --> 25:37.850
Please!

25:38.889 --> 25:39.923
Dad!

25:40.926 --> 25:43.031
You can do it. Get it done.

25:43.183 --> 25:44.383
Or not.

25:44.499 --> 25:46.332
What a stirring vote of confidence.

25:46.356 --> 25:48.474
- Mutually give pep talks.
- Where the hell are we going?

25:48.499 --> 25:49.855
I just got a location message.

25:49.919 --> 25:51.719
Russ says they're near the cave quarry.

25:51.784 --> 25:53.186
That's probably all he could send with

25:53.211 --> 25:54.807
the Dredge standing over him.

25:55.136 --> 25:56.707
That's why we're taking the tunnels.

25:56.771 --> 25:58.977
- Tunnels?
- With all the wards removed,

25:59.001 --> 26:01.001
we're vulnerable to an infernal attack.

26:01.143 --> 26:03.818
We don't want them
to track us to The Dredge,

26:03.922 --> 26:05.408
and team forces with him.

26:05.488 --> 26:07.583
So, you have tunnels
running underneath the house?

26:07.683 --> 26:08.773
Oh, yeah.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.876
We've got the underground railroad.

26:10.940 --> 26:14.049
- Did you know about this?
- Hey, I'm new here.

26:16.373 --> 26:20.439
Damn, I had no idea the caves
ran this far under your house.

26:23.026 --> 26:25.616
Just like the human
body, the Earth has meridians.

26:25.716 --> 26:26.969
Pressure points.

26:27.048 --> 26:29.358
Meridians as in like
longitude and latitude?

26:29.406 --> 26:31.747
No, mystical meridians
are certain spots on the globe

26:31.771 --> 26:33.088
that emit energy.

26:33.183 --> 26:36.195
There's rock in Australia, Stonehenge,

26:36.235 --> 26:38.147
the Sedona vortex.

26:38.314 --> 26:40.679
Sometimes the energy is of peace,

26:40.790 --> 26:42.790
and other times it's of power.

26:43.235 --> 26:45.562
The La Rochelle
meridian is also a portal.

26:45.695 --> 26:47.495
That's why we infernals
come through here.

26:47.635 --> 26:50.401
It's also why Isaac
founded the town here.

26:50.501 --> 26:52.068
You know, he was quite a good Mayor.

26:52.168 --> 26:54.335
Not a job I want.

26:54.435 --> 26:56.301
Too much ass-kissing and paperwork.

27:02.635 --> 27:04.968
He's manipulating the power meridian.

27:07.791 --> 27:09.166
Oh, my God.

27:09.564 --> 27:10.730
I feel it.

27:11.535 --> 27:12.801
Meridian time trap.

27:12.901 --> 27:13.935
Shit!

27:14.035 --> 27:16.935
I hate meridian time traps.

27:17.035 --> 27:18.307
- May?
- Yeah.

27:18.332 --> 27:19.775
Listen, with rune
bullets we don't have many,

27:19.800 --> 27:21.735
- so fire in sort bursts.
- Gotcha.

27:21.801 --> 27:23.608
- Bickley, you good?
- Yeah.

27:23.751 --> 27:25.601
I prefer pushing paper,
and kissing asses.

27:25.701 --> 27:26.935
But I'm good.

27:27.035 --> 27:29.017
- Bea?
- Yeah.

27:29.112 --> 27:30.601
I'm good.

27:30.701 --> 27:32.335
Let's move out.

27:32.435 --> 27:33.636
Wait, wait, wait.

27:33.700 --> 27:35.351
What's this meridian shit...

27:35.982 --> 27:37.215
I need some answers...

27:40.201 --> 27:42.401
- Please! Don't...
- Please...

27:42.501 --> 27:43.935
Please, Mr. Hastings, don't do this!

27:44.035 --> 27:46.068
Shut up!

27:46.801 --> 27:48.193
This is a family affair.

27:48.265 --> 27:50.032
I never wanted you
near my daughter anyway.

27:50.097 --> 27:51.700
Yes! The blood's discolorating.

27:51.701 --> 27:53.201
Stop!

27:53.301 --> 27:55.113
Stop!

27:55.368 --> 27:57.968
Come on, Calvin.

27:58.068 --> 28:00.435
I knew you were smart when I met you.

28:00.535 --> 28:02.768
I told old Isaac to watch out for you.

28:16.701 --> 28:18.301
Take your time, son.

28:18.401 --> 28:20.068
You can't hurry love.

28:41.501 --> 28:43.168
<i>Si dominae.</i>

28:43.268 --> 28:44.568
Say the words.

28:54.801 --> 28:56.968
Yes, free at last.

28:57.068 --> 28:58.291
Free at last!

28:58.316 --> 29:01.934
Thank God Almighty, he's free at last!

29:22.335 --> 29:24.668
Welcome, Hastings.

29:27.235 --> 29:28.401
- Garvey!
- May, wait...

29:28.501 --> 29:30.069
- May!
- May, wait!

29:36.268 --> 29:37.701
Let them go.

29:37.801 --> 29:39.013
It's me you want.

29:40.401 --> 29:42.201
I have what I want.

29:43.001 --> 29:44.449
Yes.

29:44.584 --> 29:46.201
Unlike you humans,

29:46.301 --> 29:48.180
I'm a compassionate being.

29:48.299 --> 29:50.666
I have no need for hostages.

29:55.535 --> 29:56.801
Are you trying to have us believe

29:56.885 --> 29:58.468
that you have everything you want?

29:58.568 --> 30:00.501
Your beliefs matter little.

30:00.601 --> 30:03.655
I admire your loving family.

30:03.935 --> 30:07.035
The family that's struck down together,

30:07.135 --> 30:09.035
stays together.

30:18.368 --> 30:19.568
Don't...

30:20.694 --> 30:22.361
...shoot!

30:27.301 --> 30:30.635
I had so looked forward
to making a house call.

30:30.713 --> 30:33.701
That's why I sent Calvin
to dig up the wards.

30:33.801 --> 30:34.888
That's right.

30:34.975 --> 30:36.801
- I know all your secrets.
- Yeah.

30:36.856 --> 30:38.401
I know all your tricks.

30:41.180 --> 30:43.613
Well, I have met your family now,

30:43.801 --> 30:46.268
and it is time for you
to meet my brethren.

30:51.403 --> 30:53.336
Born again!

30:54.836 --> 30:56.168
We born again.

31:43.535 --> 31:44.830
Kill 'em all!

31:46.868 --> 31:48.268
Isaac, behind you!

31:49.153 --> 31:51.752
Come on. Come on! Come on!

32:02.035 --> 32:04.360
Help me. Help me, help me!

32:05.668 --> 32:07.644
- Get her. Hurry up!
- Come on. Come on.

32:08.478 --> 32:10.278
Come on. Get out!

32:49.005 --> 32:50.571
- Check her out!
- I've got you.

32:51.235 --> 32:52.568
All right.

32:52.668 --> 32:53.835
Garvey...

32:53.934 --> 32:55.855
Garvey, baby, I don't have
many rune bullets, all right?

32:55.942 --> 32:57.168
I'm gonna need some of
that Hocus pocus from you.

32:58.301 --> 32:59.831
I want you to protect her, okay?

33:01.789 --> 33:03.636
- Just trust me. Okay?
- Oh...

33:06.135 --> 33:07.301
Nice.

33:07.401 --> 33:08.735
All right, Garvey, me and you,

33:08.779 --> 33:10.890
I need you to do that thing you do here.

33:11.235 --> 33:13.035
I'm trying!

33:22.768 --> 33:24.635
Okay.

33:24.703 --> 33:26.703
Come back to me. Come back to me.

33:26.835 --> 33:28.501
Focus. Focus.

33:58.922 --> 33:59.935
Come on.

34:00.035 --> 34:01.568
Come back to me.

34:22.025 --> 34:24.527
- Come back to me, Calvin.
- Ma.

34:24.599 --> 34:26.773
There you go, son.

34:26.891 --> 34:28.534
Garvey! May!

34:28.635 --> 34:31.001
- Isaac?
- They're good.

34:32.335 --> 34:35.114
Is that any way to treat an
old friend, son of Isaac?

34:35.701 --> 34:36.967
James...

34:37.635 --> 34:38.733
What are you doing here?

34:38.812 --> 34:42.335
You think I'd let you have all
that fun by yourself, now did you?

34:42.455 --> 34:43.835
Isaac threw up the bat signal.

34:43.935 --> 34:45.001
- You're okay?
- Yeah.

34:45.025 --> 34:45.937
- You're okay, son.
- You okay?

34:45.962 --> 34:47.301
Yes, I'm okay. You okay?

34:47.400 --> 34:49.135
- Ready to fight.
- Okay.

34:49.612 --> 34:51.347
James...

34:51.393 --> 34:52.601
It's good to have you back.

34:54.900 --> 34:56.435
Go, go, go, go, go.

35:07.768 --> 35:09.001
Pop!

35:15.623 --> 35:18.186
- May and Garvey?
- Over there.

35:18.226 --> 35:19.801
Go! I'll cover you.

35:28.859 --> 35:30.161
Garvey!

35:30.336 --> 35:31.835
Shoot 'em!

35:36.035 --> 35:37.368
What?

35:37.468 --> 35:39.668
Damn you, Hastings!

35:40.568 --> 35:42.168
That was my last nuke bullet.

35:45.451 --> 35:48.301
Now, please, can I get some help?

35:50.168 --> 35:52.887
- I'm trying, it's not working!
- Come on, baby, just concentrate.

35:52.951 --> 35:54.335
Remember what your grandpa taught you.

35:54.403 --> 35:56.397
The only way I could
ever hit one of those things

35:56.422 --> 35:57.484
is if I get lucky!

35:57.548 --> 35:59.711
Baby, luck is preparation
meeting opportunity.

35:59.743 --> 36:01.101
As in, right now!

36:01.482 --> 36:03.215
You sound just like Grandpa.

36:03.544 --> 36:05.135
Come on, baby! Come on, baby!

36:09.735 --> 36:11.340
That's it.

36:12.001 --> 36:14.101
Good job, baby.

36:44.985 --> 36:46.519
Nope!

37:24.335 --> 37:26.101
That's it. Keep it going!

37:26.201 --> 37:27.501
Ma... What?

37:27.601 --> 37:29.335
Calvin!

37:36.335 --> 37:37.501
Immortal!

37:38.868 --> 37:40.668
I want you to watch you family die,

37:40.768 --> 37:41.975
one by one.

38:00.235 --> 38:01.502
Calvin!

38:03.271 --> 38:05.326
- Pop!
- No, no, no...

38:07.829 --> 38:10.098
Your son bore witness to your beheading.

38:11.201 --> 38:13.501
Actually, he was a little
more hands-on than that.

38:14.964 --> 38:17.289
So, I think that you will agree

38:17.861 --> 38:19.894
that turnabout's fair play.

38:24.144 --> 38:25.192
No!

38:25.263 --> 38:27.485
- This is not over!
- No!

38:31.696 --> 38:34.868
That's for taking my robe,
you fallopian tube.

38:34.942 --> 38:37.135
Ever heard of boundaries?

38:37.235 --> 38:38.902
Equinox wiccans...

38:39.535 --> 38:41.468
Prepare to meet your demise.

38:46.816 --> 38:48.016
Garvey!

38:48.069 --> 38:49.503
Get in the circle, Bea, complete it!

38:53.335 --> 38:55.772
We present earth, air, fire,

38:55.835 --> 38:59.101
and complete with the metal from
the great goddess and Oak King.

39:01.532 --> 39:03.068
These are the elements of this Earth

39:03.168 --> 39:05.913
that shall purify the dark matter!

39:08.601 --> 39:10.001
Get him down!

39:11.123 --> 39:12.714
Never turn your back on your ex.

39:14.301 --> 39:15.545
Not of this Earth!

39:16.529 --> 39:17.735
Hold him down!

39:30.557 --> 39:32.390
I told you this ain't over.

39:37.476 --> 39:39.201
Hold on!

39:49.348 --> 39:52.379
- I'll get May!
- Garvey! Tilly!

39:52.435 --> 39:53.701
Come on, hold it down!

39:54.768 --> 39:55.801
Come on!

39:55.901 --> 39:57.729
Nobody let go!

39:57.840 --> 40:00.868
- Keep it central!
- Hold on! Hold on!

40:00.968 --> 40:03.023
Okay.

40:03.168 --> 40:04.401
Ah!

40:04.501 --> 40:05.515
Isaac!

40:05.563 --> 40:07.601
- Bea, hold on, baby!
- Don't let go of me!

40:07.687 --> 40:11.274
- Ma!
- I can't do it!

40:11.362 --> 40:12.535
Hang on, May!

40:12.635 --> 40:15.268
- Can't do it!
- Come on, everybody, hang on!

40:15.317 --> 40:16.341
You can do this!

40:16.420 --> 40:18.835
- Russ, you're slipping!
- I can't hold on!

40:18.935 --> 40:19.961
- Hang on!
- Russ!

40:20.035 --> 40:21.601
- Garvey!
- No. No!

40:21.701 --> 40:23.101
No!

40:24.901 --> 40:27.435
Russ! Russ!

40:29.228 --> 40:30.847
Hold on!

40:45.392 --> 40:47.096
Calvin.

40:47.216 --> 40:48.987
- You okay?
- Yeah.

40:50.090 --> 40:51.804
May.

40:54.891 --> 40:56.501
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

40:57.899 --> 41:00.447
- Tilly, you good?
- Good, yeah. Yeah.

41:02.568 --> 41:05.468
Garvey? Garvey! Where is she?

41:15.423 --> 41:17.066
You okay?

41:20.040 --> 41:21.401
You okay?
