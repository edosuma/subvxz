02:41.359 --> 02:42.440
Want a piece?

02:47.481 --> 02:49.701
Katie's sister, she's
coming for Christmas.

02:50.075 --> 02:52.839
Her husband is this big-shot
plumber, always buying her jewellery,

02:52.864 --> 02:54.541
but her sister is
always showing it off

02:54.566 --> 02:56.495
and throwing it on
Katie's face, you know?

02:58.485 --> 02:59.751
Well, guess what?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.534
It's payback time.

03:04.359 --> 03:05.876
Almost two karats.

03:06.203 --> 03:07.423
From Zambia.

03:07.742 --> 03:09.387
That's why there's a yellow.

03:10.089 --> 03:11.250
See the yellow?

03:11.834 --> 03:12.956
Yellow's good.

03:14.325 --> 03:15.466
Beautiful.

03:17.148 --> 03:18.396
I hate that dick.

03:25.974 --> 03:27.103
That's him.

03:32.567 --> 03:34.127
Damn! He's on the move!

03:35.162 --> 03:36.669
Cut him on the way!

03:37.368 --> 03:39.221
Get out of the van now!

03:39.279 --> 03:41.019
John, get out of the way!

03:49.340 --> 03:50.687
Breen, I'm all right.

03:52.264 --> 03:53.356
You're OK?

03:53.719 --> 03:54.740
I'm good.

04:01.590 --> 04:04.168
Officer down, Starvil 252.

04:06.827 --> 04:08.040
Stay there.

04:08.768 --> 04:09.857
Oh, shit.

04:13.233 --> 04:14.233
Fight it.

04:14.258 --> 04:15.306
Fight it.

04:15.351 --> 04:17.223
Look at me. Fight it.

04:20.278 --> 04:21.341
You gotta go.

04:22.861 --> 04:23.861
You gotta...

04:34.924 --> 04:37.001
Thirty days modified duty?

04:37.299 --> 04:39.183
It's a long time to be off the job.

04:39.719 --> 04:40.719
Yeah?

04:41.348 --> 04:43.998
But the doctor cleared
me for return, so...

04:44.061 --> 04:46.076
I'm not talking about your arm, John.

04:46.733 --> 04:48.027
Put in your twenty.

04:48.392 --> 04:49.392
More pension.

04:50.044 --> 04:51.445
If I was you, I'd hang it up.

04:51.789 --> 04:52.789
See?

04:53.589 --> 04:54.716
Good as new.

04:56.212 --> 04:58.448
Like I said, just making sure.

04:58.473 --> 04:59.961
No, no, finish your drink.

05:00.003 --> 05:01.571
- Relax.
- Thanks.

05:18.836 --> 05:20.137
Teena McGuire.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.241
Her husband worked for Good Year.

05:22.306 --> 05:24.813
Lay-off hits, four or five years ago?

05:25.649 --> 05:27.249
Boom! Cancer.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.407
No insurance, six year old girl.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.390
The guy's gone in two months.

05:32.415 --> 05:33.415
Hey!

05:33.530 --> 05:35.018
Hey babe! What is it?

05:35.458 --> 05:37.979
Hey Brad, you got a job yet?

05:39.036 --> 05:40.818
There's food in there.

05:41.122 --> 05:42.461
Make it!

05:43.283 --> 05:45.237
OK, wait til I come
home and I'll make it.

05:45.262 --> 05:47.486
- No, no-one's going home.
- I gotta go.

05:47.511 --> 05:49.048
- I gotta go.
- No you don't! - Yeah.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.099
This is our night!

05:50.124 --> 05:51.359
- Come on.
- I can't.

05:51.403 --> 05:52.432
One drink!

05:52.485 --> 05:53.641
- One.
- Alright.

05:53.666 --> 05:54.829
Still love you.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.190
What are you gonna do?

05:59.215 --> 06:01.837
Her boyfriend is going
over the Falls tonight.

06:01.922 --> 06:04.503
The dick that barfed the
beer on our car.

06:06.266 --> 06:08.673
Oh God! I wish that were true!

06:08.711 --> 06:11.007
My mum took Bethie to the movies.

06:12.406 --> 06:13.821
One night.

06:14.835 --> 06:15.835
One...

06:15.910 --> 06:16.955
night.

06:16.980 --> 06:20.321
Free from the hell of fourth
grade math and I get ditched.

06:23.612 --> 06:25.097
Gosh! Sure, why not?

06:25.122 --> 06:26.253
Thanks for asking.

06:27.376 --> 06:28.780
I'm Marteen McGuire.

06:29.300 --> 06:30.580
Friends call me Teena.

06:30.885 --> 06:32.364
Now you say your name.

06:33.557 --> 06:35.010
John Dromoor.

06:36.391 --> 06:38.049
Is this girl a psychic?

06:39.361 --> 06:40.361
Nah!

06:41.213 --> 06:42.961
I don't meet a lot

06:43.589 --> 06:45.309
of real life heroes.

06:47.441 --> 06:48.441
Seriously.

06:48.832 --> 06:49.858
It's an honor.

06:50.719 --> 06:53.001
That was back in April.

06:53.072 --> 06:55.207
Yeah, sure, a whole month ago.

06:55.218 --> 06:56.544
Who remembers?

07:01.208 --> 07:02.208
You...

07:02.721 --> 07:04.321
Crooked smile.

07:06.239 --> 07:07.370
I like that.

07:08.259 --> 07:09.559
Let's get another drink.

07:10.871 --> 07:11.871
No, no!

07:12.538 --> 07:13.735
I got this.

07:15.546 --> 07:16.546
Mike!

07:17.201 --> 07:18.948
Hey, man. Two more.

07:26.069 --> 07:28.316
My mum wants us to move in with her.

07:28.832 --> 07:31.719
Marteen! Lung cancer, the cigarette!

07:31.727 --> 07:34.859
Marteen! A ten-year old needs stability.

07:36.637 --> 07:38.838
Yeah, we would save money, but...

07:39.457 --> 07:41.571
I don't know, we're doing OK.

07:42.291 --> 07:43.498
Pretty stable.

07:44.218 --> 07:46.105
Jesus! Living with my mother?

07:47.894 --> 07:49.010
Could be worse.

07:49.306 --> 07:50.434
Hey, yikes!

07:50.561 --> 07:52.265
I gotta go pick her up.

07:55.362 --> 07:57.213
You know, you could, erm...

07:57.522 --> 08:00.623
You could call me... if you want.
You're a good listener.

08:00.876 --> 08:03.165
We'll have to work on the talking part.

08:03.342 --> 08:05.296
- I'd like to.
- Yeah, me too.

08:06.516 --> 08:07.883
I want you to know...

08:07.946 --> 08:10.384
You're gonna shut me
down just like that?

08:10.609 --> 08:12.129
No, I'm kidding... I'm kidding.

08:12.207 --> 08:13.207
No, erm...

08:13.287 --> 08:14.308
I'm...

08:14.373 --> 08:15.373
I'm a...

08:16.278 --> 08:17.385
a widower.

08:22.267 --> 08:23.861
So, we understand each other.

08:23.886 --> 08:24.990
Maybe so.

08:27.208 --> 08:28.459
John Dromoor.

08:34.018 --> 08:35.125
My new friend.

08:59.628 --> 09:00.676
What's up?

09:09.326 --> 09:10.333
Hey!

09:10.879 --> 09:11.879
Hey, Teena!

09:11.904 --> 09:12.904
Hey!

09:13.843 --> 09:15.228
This is amazing!

09:15.253 --> 09:16.668
You have a barbecue?

09:21.248 --> 09:22.532
Bethie, you're missing it.

09:31.388 --> 09:32.704
Don't let your mum see you.

09:32.882 --> 09:33.882
It's fine.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.474
She also didn't know

09:35.499 --> 09:36.534
I snuck this.

09:36.559 --> 09:37.996
You little thief.

09:43.332 --> 09:44.347
Look at that!

09:53.818 --> 09:55.233
It's awesome.

09:56.126 --> 09:57.386
I like the rain-bow.

10:00.650 --> 10:01.650
Seriously?

10:02.372 --> 10:03.452
No.

10:03.477 --> 10:04.477
I'm good.

10:05.312 --> 10:06.312
Butt-head.

10:17.678 --> 10:19.344
How long's your mum
been seeing Casey?

10:20.962 --> 10:21.962
I don't know.

10:21.987 --> 10:23.438
A while, I guess?

10:25.283 --> 10:26.706
I can see why he likes her.

10:32.692 --> 10:33.728
Bethie?

10:34.257 --> 10:37.701
Bethel Anne McGuire, you get down
right now or you'll break your neck!

10:38.146 --> 10:40.447
Now, damn it! I got this now!

10:40.519 --> 10:41.900
Mum! I'm not gonna fall!

10:41.925 --> 10:44.649
Bethie! Now! Thank you, Casey!
I have this!

10:44.650 --> 10:45.739
Now!

10:45.740 --> 10:47.834
Jesus! What am I, five?

11:08.724 --> 11:09.727
Hey.

11:09.772 --> 11:11.836
Last piece? Saved it just for you.

11:20.638 --> 11:21.882
- Hmmm.
- It's mine.

11:22.181 --> 11:23.237
I can't.

11:23.301 --> 11:24.349
You're right.

11:24.399 --> 11:26.578
You'll let the ice-cream
melting to the crust.

11:28.268 --> 11:29.681
I'm sorry I yelled.

11:34.629 --> 11:36.365
Hey, handsome!

11:36.391 --> 11:37.467
Ain't no kiss?

11:52.273 --> 11:53.440
Bethie, baby,

11:53.465 --> 11:54.801
time to be back.

11:54.846 --> 11:56.812
It's late, why don't you
guys just stay over?

11:56.838 --> 11:57.932
Come on, Case.

11:57.933 --> 12:00.352
I got some Sponge Bobs
loaded on the iPad.

12:00.410 --> 12:01.871
Bethie hasn't seen him.

12:02.057 --> 12:04.180
I ain't done with you
but it's a long shot.

12:04.205 --> 12:05.687
I still got some moves.

12:05.712 --> 12:07.020
We could stay, mum.

12:07.045 --> 12:08.660
See? Gotta load it.

12:08.685 --> 12:11.070
We have breakfast at
Grandma's, 8 AM sharp.

12:11.672 --> 12:12.800
- Are you sure?
- Hmm.

12:12.938 --> 12:15.023
- They're playing our song.
- Again?

12:15.048 --> 12:16.149
I'll run you home.

12:16.150 --> 12:18.417
No, we're gonna walk. You
shouldn't drink and drive.

12:18.418 --> 12:20.484
It's late! Come on, I'll
take you in five minutes.

12:20.697 --> 12:22.077
It's a beautiful night.

12:22.115 --> 12:24.445
Tuesday she's at my mum's, don't forget.

12:24.935 --> 12:26.211
Call you in the morning.

12:29.879 --> 12:30.879
Oh, no.

12:34.940 --> 12:37.301
Oh, Mike's telling this dream...

12:38.034 --> 12:39.089
I'd love to...

12:39.140 --> 12:41.058
Oh no, really?

12:42.272 --> 12:44.800
Why is my purse so heavy?

12:45.335 --> 12:46.514
Hey?

12:47.387 --> 12:49.827
Must be sweet having such a great mum.

12:52.650 --> 12:53.901
You know, when you were a baby

12:53.902 --> 12:56.969
your father used to take you out
on long walks around here.

12:57.592 --> 13:00.165
You always took your dolls.
You had to have them.

13:00.190 --> 13:01.344
I hate dolls.

13:04.397 --> 13:05.397
Hey.

13:06.629 --> 13:07.629
Sweetie?

13:08.991 --> 13:09.991
Wait!

13:12.530 --> 13:13.553
Bethie.

13:13.578 --> 13:15.919
What is it? You don't mind
me talking about your Dad?

13:15.952 --> 13:16.952
Actually,

13:17.605 --> 13:20.530
I don't like you treating me... like

13:21.285 --> 13:22.784
like I'm an infant.

13:23.719 --> 13:25.590
I wasn't gonna fall, mum.

13:25.779 --> 13:26.779
Honey...

13:26.844 --> 13:27.844
Please.

13:28.537 --> 13:29.537
Don't.

13:35.445 --> 13:36.544
I can't remember.

13:37.989 --> 13:39.102
Baby.

13:41.276 --> 13:43.204
I can't remember what he looks like.

13:46.369 --> 13:47.447
His face.

13:50.611 --> 13:51.822
I try.

13:54.240 --> 13:55.693
Really hard.

13:56.322 --> 13:58.105
But he just goes away.

13:59.366 --> 14:01.036
Like he was never there.

14:02.809 --> 14:03.809
It's all right.

14:08.105 --> 14:09.105
And...

14:11.222 --> 14:13.366
When you least expect it...

14:14.161 --> 14:15.186
Out of the blue...

14:17.006 --> 14:18.006
There he is.

14:20.710 --> 14:21.710
Hey.

14:23.136 --> 14:24.718
None of this is just you.

14:26.007 --> 14:28.053
Not your fault you couldn't remember.

14:30.899 --> 14:31.899
Hey, honey.

14:33.272 --> 14:34.706
I miss him too.

14:38.771 --> 14:40.531
It's just how memory works.

14:42.190 --> 14:43.283
Are you sure?

14:44.859 --> 14:46.964
Cross my heart and hope to die.

14:53.500 --> 14:54.562
You know what?

14:54.662 --> 14:56.266
I know a short cut.

14:56.898 --> 14:57.898
Come on.

14:58.967 --> 15:00.510
Let's get you home.

15:04.724 --> 15:05.724
Down here?

15:05.749 --> 15:06.766
Yeah!

15:06.791 --> 15:08.279
OK, his face is creepy.

15:08.280 --> 15:09.337
Oh, he's fine!

15:09.394 --> 15:11.002
He's been there since high school.

15:11.003 --> 15:12.413
It is dark but...

15:21.856 --> 15:23.549
- Mamma?
- Yeah?

15:23.731 --> 15:24.954
Where are we?

15:24.999 --> 15:26.007
You don't remember?

15:26.032 --> 15:27.064
No.

15:27.645 --> 15:29.092
You, me, your Dad...

15:29.117 --> 15:32.054
We used to come out here, rent a canoe,

15:32.785 --> 15:34.435
and go look at Niagara Falls.

15:34.693 --> 15:36.128
- Really?
- Yeah!

15:36.258 --> 15:37.642
Can we still rent one?

15:38.018 --> 15:39.512
You know what? I'm not sure.

15:39.537 --> 15:41.755
Maybe. I'll give them a
call in the morning.

15:42.867 --> 15:43.888
That'll be fun.

15:43.892 --> 15:44.908
Yeah.

15:45.708 --> 15:46.800
Careful.

15:57.783 --> 16:00.109
- This place is beautiful.
- Yeah?

16:01.052 --> 16:03.375
- Oh, look! There's a mermaid.
- Yeah!

16:03.817 --> 16:05.459
They call this place "Mermaid Cove".

16:05.897 --> 16:07.151
I didn't know that.

16:07.176 --> 16:08.795
I can't remember how it goes.

16:08.995 --> 16:11.724
<i>♪ There once was a mermaid, ♪</i>

16:11.725 --> 16:13.490
<i>♪ who lived by the pond, ♪</i>

16:13.491 --> 16:16.088
<i>♪ who was very beautiful, ♪</i>

16:16.113 --> 16:18.394

16:21.788 --> 16:25.211
Hey, it is Marvin Fick, remember me?
Of course you do.

16:26.292 --> 16:27.484
You remember Teena McGuire?

16:27.485 --> 16:29.729
- The cheerleader?
- The cheerleader, ha, ha!

16:29.754 --> 16:32.051
What are you doing here?
Happy Independence Day!

16:32.052 --> 16:33.083
Leave us alone.

16:33.108 --> 16:34.460
Happy Independence Day!

16:34.485 --> 16:36.227
Hey, come on, guys. Leave us alone.

16:36.252 --> 16:37.979
What you guys doing? You wanna
stick around?

16:37.980 --> 16:39.282
You wanna have a beer?

16:39.283 --> 16:40.321
We got some smoke.

16:40.346 --> 16:41.699
Oh my God, is this your daughter?

16:41.724 --> 16:44.632
A handsome guy like you, you
gotta have a girlfriend.

16:44.657 --> 16:46.148
You wouldn't wanna piss her off.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.173
Leave us alone.

16:47.198 --> 16:49.017
She won't mind, will she, Lloyd?

16:49.042 --> 16:50.471
No, she won't mind.

16:50.496 --> 16:51.721
Hey! No, no, no!

16:54.394 --> 16:55.394
Bethie!

16:59.452 --> 17:01.134
Get her! Get her!

17:01.436 --> 17:02.506
Turn her in!

17:02.531 --> 17:03.542
I got her legs.

17:07.015 --> 17:08.615
Open the door!

17:10.088 --> 17:11.088
Bethie!

17:11.978 --> 17:12.978
Bethie!

17:14.877 --> 17:16.348
Get in there! Get in there!

17:17.695 --> 17:18.695
Get inside!

17:18.723 --> 17:19.723
Get inside!

17:20.492 --> 17:21.555
Bethie!

17:26.406 --> 17:27.406
Come on!

17:27.432 --> 17:29.348
Don't chase her, she's got no way to go.

17:36.593 --> 17:37.593
Mammy!

17:39.928 --> 17:42.184
Leave her alone, please!

17:49.018 --> 17:50.466
Don't hurt her, please!

17:50.860 --> 17:52.820
Please, don't hurt her, please!

18:03.867 --> 18:05.530
Get off me!

18:23.638 --> 18:24.638
Whooo!

18:24.763 --> 18:26.047
Did we deceive her?

18:28.457 --> 18:29.627
Let's go!!

18:29.628 --> 18:30.649
I showed this bitch...

18:30.650 --> 18:32.617
Happy Fourth of July!

19:57.884 --> 19:59.565
Please, mom!

20:01.954 --> 20:03.452
It's OK!

20:04.686 --> 20:05.957
It's OK!

20:21.547 --> 20:22.655
What's this?

20:32.019 --> 20:33.019
Hey!

20:36.180 --> 20:37.649
Call an ambulance!

20:47.783 --> 20:49.047
NFPD!

21:42.273 --> 21:43.750
DNA, fingerprints...

21:44.025 --> 21:46.339
The only thing they didn't
leave were name tags.

22:04.253 --> 22:05.295
I'll help her.

22:38.623 --> 22:40.528
No, no, no, Ma'am, stay down, stay down!

22:40.553 --> 22:43.047
Ma'am, you have to stay down.

22:43.072 --> 22:44.717
The juvenile, they raped her too?

22:47.596 --> 22:48.596
Mom!

22:49.474 --> 22:50.864
Mom!

22:50.889 --> 22:52.482
No, come back here. I'm sorry!

22:52.507 --> 22:55.188
I wanna see my mum!
You have to stay down here, I'm so sorry!

22:55.213 --> 22:56.335
Mom!

23:13.804 --> 23:14.804
It's OK, it's OK.

23:14.829 --> 23:17.078
It's OK. You're gonna be OK now.

23:18.536 --> 23:20.047
I'm gonna go get you a brace.

23:30.202 --> 23:31.379
He'll be down soon.

23:31.404 --> 23:33.698
- No, I'm not waiting for the doctor.
- Ma'am...

23:33.699 --> 23:34.997
Don't Ma'am me.

23:35.022 --> 23:36.438
I wanna see my daughter.

23:36.559 --> 23:37.947
I wanna see my girl.

23:40.313 --> 23:41.313
God damn it!

23:44.643 --> 23:45.643
Oh God!

23:46.283 --> 23:47.401
Oh, hey!

23:49.036 --> 23:50.813
Hey, my little angel.

23:51.986 --> 23:53.548
Hey, are you OK?

23:53.549 --> 23:55.280
What did they do to you?

23:55.368 --> 23:56.936
- I'm OK.
- Yeah?

23:57.300 --> 23:59.424
- Promise?
- You promise, huh?

24:01.109 --> 24:02.197
How's mamma?

24:03.634 --> 24:05.526
She's fine,

24:06.170 --> 24:08.919
because you and I are
gonna stick together.

24:09.154 --> 24:10.566
And we're gonna make sure...

24:10.567 --> 24:11.921
Mrs Kevecki,

24:11.946 --> 24:13.354
Detective John Dromoor.

24:13.374 --> 24:15.466
I'm with my grand-daughter.

24:15.467 --> 24:18.306
Well, that's the thing, Ma'am. She
got a good look at those guys.

24:18.331 --> 24:20.650
She's 12... she's 12 years old.

24:20.701 --> 24:23.322
Her mum can't talk,
she's our only witness.

24:23.585 --> 24:25.786
It's OK, baby, that's
all right, sweetheart.

24:26.890 --> 24:28.444
Can you please wait?

24:32.159 --> 24:33.673
I need your help.

24:37.131 --> 24:39.014
Go! Go! NFPD!

24:39.277 --> 24:41.007
Get down! Don't move!

24:41.169 --> 24:42.285
Get down!

24:43.020 --> 24:44.475
You can't come in here like...

24:44.500 --> 24:46.281
Get your kids away!

24:47.283 --> 24:48.980
Police! Don't make a move!

24:49.012 --> 24:50.402
- What is this?
- Go!

24:50.427 --> 24:52.189
Lloyd! Keep your mouth shut!

24:52.190 --> 24:53.285
Get up!

24:53.310 --> 24:54.997
Keep your mouth shut!

24:56.306 --> 24:57.306
Get up!

24:58.332 --> 24:59.406
Stay down!

24:59.707 --> 25:01.966
What did I do? What did I do?

25:02.010 --> 25:03.322
Walter, do something!

25:03.323 --> 25:05.141
Do something! Oh, my God!

25:05.389 --> 25:06.727
What is this?

25:07.052 --> 25:08.052
Marvin!

25:08.176 --> 25:09.992
I'm gonna call Father Muldoon!

25:21.710 --> 25:23.070
Go! You're good?

25:23.180 --> 25:24.180
Yes!

25:24.321 --> 25:25.321
Stop!

25:27.351 --> 25:29.431
Marvin, stop, police!

25:30.115 --> 25:32.063
Where are you gonna go? Stop!

25:34.019 --> 25:35.813
Stop running!

25:37.317 --> 25:38.357
Stop!

26:01.493 --> 26:02.807
One to seven.

26:03.738 --> 26:04.937
One on this side.

26:04.938 --> 26:06.347
Seven on the end.

26:06.652 --> 26:08.819
There's nothing to be
afraid of, sweetie.

26:08.898 --> 26:10.905
Hey, Bethie, you're gonna pick them out

26:10.930 --> 26:13.387
and I'm gonna put him away
for a very long time.

26:13.517 --> 26:14.993
They can't hurt you,

26:15.018 --> 26:16.446
I won't let them.

26:16.809 --> 26:17.809
OK?

26:18.914 --> 26:21.900
The guy in the white eight top.

26:22.468 --> 26:23.468
Number two.

26:27.326 --> 26:29.054
And the one right next to him.

26:29.079 --> 26:30.866
And in the avant garde pants.

26:32.559 --> 26:33.559
Three.

26:36.009 --> 26:37.009
Five.

26:40.078 --> 26:41.078
And seven.

26:44.244 --> 26:45.244
That's them.

26:47.099 --> 26:50.143
Numbers 2, 3, 5 and 7, step forward.

26:56.188 --> 26:58.050
Marvin and Lloyd Fick.

26:59.022 --> 27:00.022
Fritz Haaber.

27:00.549 --> 27:01.549
Jimmy de Lucca.

27:39.468 --> 27:41.339
Bethie, oh my God.

27:41.859 --> 27:42.904
I'm so sorry.

27:43.343 --> 27:44.376
It's OK.

27:44.449 --> 27:45.926
She's gonna be fine.

27:46.596 --> 27:48.332
Her brain stem's good, so,

27:48.357 --> 27:49.802
unless one of them goes down.

27:49.803 --> 27:51.526
They'll let her out.

27:53.612 --> 27:55.315
Thanks for bringing lilies.

27:56.145 --> 27:57.286
She loves them.

27:58.575 --> 27:59.575
Miss K.

27:59.600 --> 28:01.747
Miss K., I came as soon as I heard.

28:02.308 --> 28:03.308
Why?

28:03.686 --> 28:05.266
Oh, what are you doing here?

28:06.288 --> 28:08.687
Look, her color is better.

28:10.731 --> 28:12.735
Did you forget the backpack in the car?

28:12.760 --> 28:13.793
Ouch.

28:13.853 --> 28:14.999
I got it, give here.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.123
I parked just out front, sweetheart.

28:20.775 --> 28:21.819
Sorry.

28:42.119 --> 28:45.487
Marteen McGuire, new patient,
she came in last night?

28:45.512 --> 28:46.653
Are you family?

28:48.971 --> 28:50.313
Sir, are you family?

29:44.592 --> 29:46.264
My favourite is Duffy Duck.

29:51.481 --> 29:52.721
Mum needs you inside.

29:53.752 --> 29:56.580
Oh, I need you to stop
looking like a whore.

29:57.459 --> 29:59.252
Where are you going looking like that?

30:05.135 --> 30:06.933
They couldn't have done this, Father.

30:06.958 --> 30:08.452
They're good boys.

30:09.355 --> 30:10.727
They didn't do it.

30:12.789 --> 30:14.343
For those that truly love him,

30:14.487 --> 30:17.830
God promises to make
things right and good.

30:17.923 --> 30:20.087
If we do our job,

30:20.815 --> 30:22.732
He keeps thy great promise.

30:23.131 --> 30:25.043
As a good Christian parents,

30:25.196 --> 30:26.421
what is your part?

30:27.873 --> 30:30.386
Yes, Irma, we are all His children,

30:31.069 --> 30:32.633
but until he calls us,

30:33.151 --> 30:34.778
we live in this world.

30:35.627 --> 30:37.411
Sometimes He sends an angel,

30:37.605 --> 30:38.746
sometimes...

30:40.564 --> 30:41.775
a messenger.

30:43.190 --> 30:44.295
Your part...

30:44.771 --> 30:47.732
is hiring the best criminal
lawyer you can find.

30:47.757 --> 30:49.354
Who's gonna pay that bill?

30:50.052 --> 30:51.096
God?

30:51.121 --> 30:52.163
You hear that?

30:52.188 --> 30:53.645
Times of trial...

30:58.091 --> 30:59.338
Jay Kirkpatrick.

31:00.929 --> 31:02.619
Sure, he'll charge an arm and a leg.

31:02.644 --> 31:04.317
But he is your man.

31:04.342 --> 31:07.372
He represented 18 cases for the Vatican.

31:09.066 --> 31:12.540
But in this world, a factory
town with no more factories,

31:13.281 --> 31:15.746
tourists are all that's left.

31:18.539 --> 31:20.770
A gang-rape in a city park,

31:22.210 --> 31:23.784
that's bad for business.

31:24.816 --> 31:26.160
Jay Kirkpatrick.

31:29.502 --> 31:30.561
Excuse me.

31:31.399 --> 31:33.743
It's your mum,
honey, she's awake.

31:34.582 --> 31:35.595
OK.

31:52.209 --> 31:53.209
Mamma?

31:54.844 --> 31:55.844
Mamma?

31:59.604 --> 32:00.604
Mamma?

32:02.670 --> 32:04.128
She's the same.

32:05.819 --> 32:06.819
Hey.

32:07.577 --> 32:08.577
Hi baby.

32:10.061 --> 32:11.338
It's Bethie and I.

32:12.271 --> 32:13.305
We're here.

32:15.228 --> 32:16.228
Hey.

32:19.224 --> 32:20.588
Something happened.

32:20.683 --> 32:21.990
It's OK, mamma.

32:22.657 --> 32:23.657
The roof.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.100
- No.
- I told you...

32:28.560 --> 32:29.827
to get down.

32:29.883 --> 32:31.430
No, mamma.

32:34.375 --> 32:35.882
She doesn't remember.

32:36.088 --> 32:37.744
It's OK, honey, she's...

32:38.448 --> 32:40.048
She just woke up.

32:42.294 --> 32:44.106
They have been in trouble before.

32:44.442 --> 32:45.617
That McCormick girl?

32:45.715 --> 32:47.008
Lying bitch.

32:47.009 --> 32:48.920
She withdrew the whole complaint.

32:48.921 --> 32:51.991
The police said they got
evidence, blood and DNA.

32:52.016 --> 32:53.701
- Television.
- Really?

32:54.799 --> 32:56.160
In a Jury trial,

32:56.319 --> 32:58.041
there are two stories.

32:58.461 --> 33:01.341
The Jury picks the story
they like the best.

33:01.988 --> 33:03.542
The story

33:03.853 --> 33:05.930
and how you tell it,

33:06.224 --> 33:07.929
that's all that matters.

33:07.954 --> 33:10.316
So how much for your story?

33:12.611 --> 33:15.118
I like that, cuts right to the chase.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.271
850 an hour.

33:17.299 --> 33:19.250
- 1250 in Court.
- Screw me.

33:19.275 --> 33:22.847
That's against our $50,000
retainer fee for each boy.

33:22.848 --> 33:24.363
We cannot do that!

33:24.952 --> 33:26.424
Oh, yes, we can.

33:26.699 --> 33:27.921
And we will.

33:33.362 --> 33:34.616
Our house.

33:35.412 --> 33:38.429
I worked 30 years to pay that off.

33:38.903 --> 33:40.823
It's all that we got.

33:42.603 --> 33:45.434
We're paying twice because
it's two sons, right?

33:46.319 --> 33:47.383
Two clients.

33:48.907 --> 33:50.914
But they're charged with the same crime.

33:50.930 --> 33:52.215
So one story.

33:52.646 --> 33:53.701
Jesus, Walt!

33:53.702 --> 33:56.837
Wait, it's like... a
woman has two babies.

33:57.472 --> 34:00.003
They ain't twice as much work,
she does the same thing for both,

34:00.004 --> 34:01.735
that's why she's got
two tits, right?

34:01.736 --> 34:02.792
Can you believe this...?

34:02.817 --> 34:04.069
It's OK.

34:05.300 --> 34:08.380
Well now, Walt, wouldn't you have
made a damned fine attorney?

34:11.027 --> 34:12.366
My point is...

34:12.446 --> 34:16.625
maybe you could see your way clear
to giving us a discount here.

34:19.351 --> 34:22.149
I understand your dilemma,
Walt, I really do.

34:22.187 --> 34:24.025
See, I'm a father myself.

34:24.402 --> 34:28.907
But sometimes, we're cast with
making difficult choices.

34:29.630 --> 34:33.590
But we always want to do the right
for our kids, right or wrong.

34:33.716 --> 34:36.231
We'll do anything to help them out,

34:36.487 --> 34:38.202
spare them any pain.

34:39.654 --> 34:41.797
Trust me, you're doing the right thing.

34:44.210 --> 34:45.599
Walt, listen to me.

34:45.960 --> 34:49.344
You're paying me to keep
your sons out of jail.

34:49.896 --> 34:51.786
So that they don't get raped.

34:52.072 --> 34:54.647
Like that innocent woman.

35:03.631 --> 35:04.631
Helen!

35:05.535 --> 35:08.026
Draw up an engagement letter
for the Ficks, please.

35:11.809 --> 35:14.551
Looks like someone might be
coming home real soon, huh?

35:22.596 --> 35:25.054
The police came by today, they were...

35:25.384 --> 35:26.878
asking about...

35:29.189 --> 35:30.850
walking Bethie home.

35:32.938 --> 35:33.956
No.

35:33.981 --> 35:36.588
They wanted to know if you could
maybe look at a few photographs,

35:36.589 --> 35:38.353
in case you might
remember something.

35:38.405 --> 35:39.619
I can't.

35:42.394 --> 35:45.389
It's so weird, I can't
remember anything.

35:46.332 --> 35:47.980
It's OK, it's OK.

35:48.126 --> 35:49.710
No, no, no, it's OK.

35:50.058 --> 35:52.446
The doc says this kind of
stuff comes back in time,

35:52.447 --> 35:54.261
It's nothing to worry about.

35:54.504 --> 35:56.581
This came for you while you were asleep.

35:56.606 --> 36:00.242
I gave her your mail to open it
but I said that's snooping.

36:01.093 --> 36:03.690
No-one likes a snitch, Bethie.

36:07.538 --> 36:09.483
I didn't know you liked flowers.

36:09.895 --> 36:12.902
I said I don't like cut flowers,
there's a difference.

36:14.153 --> 36:15.279
Is there?

36:41.976 --> 36:44.043
Mom, no, not in your house.

36:44.044 --> 36:45.208
I don't wanna hear it.

36:45.438 --> 36:46.754
It's OK, mamma.

36:48.968 --> 36:51.664
We're not moving in,
I told her that, OK?

36:53.528 --> 36:54.937
Jesus Christ.

36:55.593 --> 36:57.699
Please, mamma, we need help.

36:58.668 --> 37:00.800
Just until you get a little bit better.

37:02.992 --> 37:04.960
Grandma's time machine.

37:05.811 --> 37:10.195
She keeps everything the same,
she would still treat me like I'm 16.

37:16.185 --> 37:17.419
How are you doing?

37:18.101 --> 37:19.510
Things could be worse.

37:24.364 --> 37:25.364
Thank you.

37:28.225 --> 37:30.170
You haven't touched your ice-cream?

37:33.298 --> 37:35.015
I wasn't hungry, I guess.

37:35.729 --> 37:37.317
For blueberry swirl?

37:38.484 --> 37:39.484
Really?

37:41.511 --> 37:44.208
Well, well, well, the girl is sick.

38:02.638 --> 38:03.638
Sweetheart?

38:05.376 --> 38:06.800
Listen to me.

38:08.879 --> 38:12.212
Those animals aren't gonna...
come near us.

38:12.986 --> 38:14.483
They've been warned.

38:16.235 --> 38:17.756
They know where we live.

38:23.162 --> 38:24.711
God! You're beautiful.

38:26.168 --> 38:27.168
Help!

38:27.800 --> 38:29.498
I've done this the first time.

38:34.337 --> 38:35.337
Help me!

38:37.293 --> 38:38.293
Help me!

39:09.829 --> 39:11.039
Don't touch me!

39:13.831 --> 39:14.923
It's OK.

39:15.043 --> 39:16.043
It's OK.

39:16.308 --> 39:17.308
It's OK.

39:19.092 --> 39:20.642
No. Why?

39:22.764 --> 39:24.805
Why would they do that?

39:29.411 --> 39:31.081
No, baby.

39:31.767 --> 39:32.767
Oh, no.

39:32.816 --> 39:34.066
Oh, no.

39:34.403 --> 39:35.455
I'm so sorry.

39:38.350 --> 39:39.375
I'm so sorry.

39:39.806 --> 39:40.916
That's OK.

39:41.593 --> 39:42.700
It's OK.

39:49.351 --> 39:52.692
My mum likes a lot of bacon so,
you should go talk to Jack.

39:54.587 --> 39:55.615
Not talk.

39:56.164 --> 39:57.235
Ignore him.

39:57.260 --> 39:58.627
Watch and learn.

40:14.048 --> 40:16.125
All those lies about my brothers...

40:16.759 --> 40:18.586
Bitch better watch her mouth.

40:19.490 --> 40:22.405
You and your whore mamma
better shut your faces.

40:22.827 --> 40:24.029
You hear me?

40:45.040 --> 40:47.407
This is just about
summoning them to trial.

40:47.889 --> 40:50.525
All you have to do is identify them.

40:51.109 --> 40:53.014
You're gonna keep your eyes on me.

40:53.236 --> 40:54.797
And don't look at anyone else.

40:54.822 --> 40:56.247
Until you ask me, who?

40:57.255 --> 40:58.982
Not who, but if.

40:59.632 --> 41:01.151
If you see them?

41:02.290 --> 41:05.035
First I'm gonna ask how you
knew them to establish...

41:05.036 --> 41:07.213
She didn't know them, they
knew from the neighborhood.

41:07.214 --> 41:08.475
Mom, stay out of this.

41:08.545 --> 41:11.292
- Mrs Kevecki.
- Knew them? Jesus Christ!

41:11.794 --> 41:12.794
You're right.

41:13.716 --> 41:15.060
She didn't know them.

41:15.969 --> 41:19.503
And I will make that very
clear in Court, I promise.

41:19.878 --> 41:21.382
OK, I hope so.

41:22.522 --> 41:23.522
Hey.

41:25.413 --> 41:26.547
Eyes on me.

41:27.803 --> 41:28.803
OK?

41:29.099 --> 41:30.208
Here we go.

41:31.033 --> 41:32.581
Mrs McGuire,

41:32.606 --> 41:35.186
Do you see these men in Court today?

41:36.719 --> 41:38.623
Yes, I see them.

41:38.624 --> 41:39.644
Perfect.

41:39.682 --> 41:41.063
It couldn't be any better.

41:41.251 --> 41:42.251
OK?

41:42.699 --> 41:43.762
Sweetie?

41:43.787 --> 41:45.031
What do you think? Look.

41:45.056 --> 41:46.390
I think they look conservative.

41:46.391 --> 41:47.765
Mom, no.

41:49.070 --> 41:50.854
Here, I got this.

41:51.915 --> 41:52.915
See?

41:53.113 --> 41:54.113
Thank you.

41:55.963 --> 41:57.844
I really should be there.

41:57.909 --> 42:00.751
No, she can't.
She gets too emotional.

42:00.752 --> 42:01.845
It's OK.

42:01.846 --> 42:05.104
Mrs Kevecki, this is just a
hearing, it's nothing...

42:05.147 --> 42:07.754
At trial, yes, we will need you there.

42:07.755 --> 42:10.451
Nothing? This is my daughter,
my daughter is not nothing.

42:10.476 --> 42:13.025
We don't need you for this.

42:14.599 --> 42:16.430
I think we have a winner.

42:18.451 --> 42:19.487
Great.

42:20.907 --> 42:22.372
So, we're all set?

42:22.776 --> 42:23.988
Are we, mom?

42:24.941 --> 42:26.037
Are we all set?

42:26.129 --> 42:27.290
Yes, baby.

42:27.610 --> 42:29.138
You're doing great.

42:30.301 --> 42:31.845
- We're all set.
- OK.

42:31.860 --> 42:32.860
OK?

42:33.281 --> 42:34.281
Alright.

42:35.420 --> 42:36.420
Yeah.

42:40.753 --> 42:42.809
You are my brave girl.

42:43.593 --> 42:44.837
Are you hungry?

42:46.488 --> 42:48.678
I made some soup... tomato.

42:48.875 --> 42:51.439
With bacon and that,
like Daddy used to do.

42:53.614 --> 42:55.169
Let's go heat it up.

42:55.999 --> 42:57.219
I'll be right back.

43:02.331 --> 43:03.373
Teena.

43:05.587 --> 43:06.928
Friday morning

43:07.400 --> 43:09.019
is the first step,

43:09.113 --> 43:12.345
in a series of steps to make
sure that men like that,

43:12.383 --> 43:14.824
never do this to anyone ever again.

43:20.842 --> 43:21.842
Hey.

43:24.243 --> 43:25.772
I'll see you in Court.

43:40.814 --> 43:41.814
Detective Dromoor...

44:06.601 --> 44:08.146
You point them out,

44:08.147 --> 44:09.740
I'll put them away.

44:16.364 --> 44:18.280
♪ <i>Teena...</i> ♪

44:18.721 --> 44:20.336
♪ <i>Teena...</i> ♪

44:20.337 --> 44:21.573
You lying whore!

44:21.598 --> 44:22.608
What did you say?

44:22.609 --> 44:24.510
- I said...
- Shh.. Irma.

44:24.573 --> 44:25.680
Take a seat.

44:32.120 --> 44:33.606
Silence!

44:37.805 --> 44:39.184
All rise!

44:45.535 --> 44:47.474
We seem to be missing a lawyer!

44:47.499 --> 44:48.499
Right!

44:48.806 --> 44:50.112
You may be seated!

45:00.415 --> 45:02.728
Jay Kirkpatrick for the
defense, your Honor.

45:02.729 --> 45:04.834
My sincere apologies.

45:05.172 --> 45:08.400
I got trapped on a conference
call on a Federal matter.

45:08.425 --> 45:10.408
No harm, no foul.

45:11.021 --> 45:12.477
Good morning, counselor.

45:12.510 --> 45:13.524
Good morning!

45:14.628 --> 45:15.681
All right!

45:15.706 --> 45:16.726
So...

45:16.751 --> 45:18.687
What are we all doing here this morning?

45:19.295 --> 45:23.691
Your Honor, on July 4th, Marteen
McGuire was viciously attacked,

45:24.067 --> 45:27.677
in fact, she was gang-raped in
the presence of her daughter,

45:27.678 --> 45:29.239
who was also assaulted.

45:29.264 --> 45:32.417
The State plan is to show that
the attack was premeditated

45:32.442 --> 45:35.236
as the defendants stalked
her ten minutes prior.

45:35.746 --> 45:39.407
This gruesome attack was
intended to lead to the death

45:39.408 --> 45:42.499
of Mrs McGuire, as she was left,

45:42.658 --> 45:45.316
in a boat house, to bleed to death.

45:45.758 --> 45:49.418
In fact, if Mrs McGuire's
daughter had not been present,

45:49.443 --> 45:54.146
Marteen McGuire would not be alive
today, to give her testimony.

45:55.314 --> 45:58.775
Mrs McGuire suffered
serious physical injuries,

45:59.099 --> 46:01.415
she's been in intensive care

46:01.482 --> 46:05.034
and she's still recuperating
from the attack today.

46:05.270 --> 46:06.313
Your Honor,

46:06.396 --> 46:08.740
Marteen McGuire's presence
in this Courtroom today

46:08.741 --> 46:10.413
is something of a miracle.

46:10.828 --> 46:11.828
Your Honor,

46:12.350 --> 46:17.285
I had no idea that the People
intended on trying this case today.

46:17.286 --> 46:19.877
But... if it pleases the Court,

46:20.761 --> 46:22.102
we're ready.

46:25.267 --> 46:26.267
OK!

46:26.438 --> 46:29.995
Well, then I'll just save my
opening statement for the trial.

46:31.935 --> 46:33.152
Call your first witness.

46:33.605 --> 46:36.158
The People call detective John Dromoor.

46:44.761 --> 46:48.072
And on the night of July 4th, detective,

46:48.491 --> 46:51.238
you responded to a call
in Rocky Point Park.

46:51.916 --> 46:53.080
Your Honor,

46:54.494 --> 46:57.191
We're gonna have big
problems here if the State

46:57.192 --> 47:01.068
refuses to honor the basic
principles of discovery.

47:02.038 --> 47:03.952
We have no record of a call.

47:04.319 --> 47:05.399
One moment, you Honor.

47:05.400 --> 47:08.871
Actually, me and my partner were coming
from another call, when we observed...

47:08.872 --> 47:12.470
Actually, detective,
it's my partner and I...

47:12.915 --> 47:15.318
And actually, there's
no question pending.

47:16.297 --> 47:17.783
I'd like to rephrase, your Honor.

47:17.784 --> 47:18.876
Thank you, Jesus.

47:18.877 --> 47:21.339
Detective, on the
night of July 4th

47:21.340 --> 47:24.510
when you and your partner were
driving through Rocky Point Park,

47:24.511 --> 47:25.704
What did you observe?

47:25.842 --> 47:29.367
An injured young female came towards
us from outside the boat house.

47:29.507 --> 47:32.260
This young girl here? Bethel McGuire?

47:32.285 --> 47:33.285
Yes.

47:34.460 --> 47:38.214
And when you entered the boat
house, what did you observe?

47:49.647 --> 47:51.735
Detective, you may step down.

47:52.075 --> 47:54.072
The People call Marteen McGuire.

48:05.959 --> 48:07.763
Excuse me, Mrs McGuire,

48:07.764 --> 48:10.607
would you mind removing
the sun glasses?

48:10.608 --> 48:12.338
It's really not that
bright in here.

48:12.339 --> 48:16.067
Your Honor, due to the injuries Mrs
McGuire sustained in this brutal attack,

48:16.068 --> 48:18.776
she's been made unusually
susceptible to light.

48:18.994 --> 48:21.471
Well, they're distracting,

48:21.758 --> 48:24.399
perhaps she could try squinting.

48:29.317 --> 48:30.839
Thank you Mrs McGuire.

48:49.354 --> 48:50.889
- Mrs McGuire?
- Yeah?

48:53.693 --> 48:55.477
Prior to your attack,

48:55.478 --> 48:57.485
did you know the assailants?

48:57.613 --> 48:59.126
They knew my name.

48:59.127 --> 49:01.110
Objection! Unresponsive!

49:01.135 --> 49:03.488
- Teena, Teena...
- Sustained!

49:03.489 --> 49:04.533
Teena!

49:04.558 --> 49:07.476
Please, wait for the next
question, Mrs McGuire.

49:07.501 --> 49:09.323
- Yes, I see them.
- Look at me.

49:10.356 --> 49:14.153
Your Honor, the defense
is happy to stipulate,

49:14.227 --> 49:18.031
Mrs McGuire's positive identification
of all four defendants.

49:18.828 --> 49:21.219
Thank you, Mrs McGuire,
you may step down.

49:21.244 --> 49:24.897
- Excuse me, your Honor...
- No, no, they're here! They're here.

49:25.507 --> 49:27.610
I'm sorry, Miss Dixon...

49:27.611 --> 49:30.189
Does the State have another
question for this witness?

49:30.214 --> 49:31.497
No, your Honor.

49:31.522 --> 49:33.414
Yes, they're there, they're right there!

49:33.415 --> 49:35.452
Shh, OK, let's go.

49:39.685 --> 49:42.910
Do I do OK, do I have a chance?
They'll move them?

49:59.629 --> 50:02.284
I don't know, it'll be right up.

50:04.454 --> 50:05.780
You did fine.

50:09.753 --> 50:11.690
The evidence is overwhelming.

50:11.888 --> 50:15.428
Justice demands that these men
stand trial on first degree rape,

50:15.429 --> 50:18.174
predatory assault and
aggravated assault.

50:19.120 --> 50:20.329
Your Honor,

50:20.400 --> 50:21.926
my clients

50:23.089 --> 50:27.412
freely admit that they had sex with
Mrs McGuire in that boat house.

50:28.878 --> 50:30.725
But it wasn't rape,

50:31.470 --> 50:33.333
it was consensual.

50:35.544 --> 50:37.537
As the evidence will show,

50:38.593 --> 50:41.652
Mrs McGuire had been drinking
earlier that evening

50:41.653 --> 50:44.545
at a party given by
a Raymond Casey.

50:44.897 --> 50:46.090
Her...

50:46.662 --> 50:48.398
ladies' boyfriend.

50:50.514 --> 50:55.568
A party where five kegs of beer
were consumed by 19 people.

50:58.505 --> 51:02.361
You know a keg of beer has
165,12 oz of beer in it?

51:02.386 --> 51:05.440
Five kegs of beer, 19 people?
It's mind boggling.

51:06.673 --> 51:08.804
And then, shortly after midnight,

51:09.493 --> 51:12.249
after she had gotten in a
fight with her boyfriend.

51:12.336 --> 51:15.386
Mrs McGuire dragged her
12 year old daughter

51:15.387 --> 51:17.587
to Rocky Point Park.

51:18.197 --> 51:20.030
- We were walking home!
- Shh.

51:20.031 --> 51:23.452
Young lady, you will control yourself.

51:23.477 --> 51:26.251
She dragged her daughter
to Rocky Point Park,

51:26.276 --> 51:28.523
where she met up with the defendants.

51:29.324 --> 51:30.795
Whom she knew.

51:32.066 --> 51:36.528
And she offered to trade money for sex.

51:39.968 --> 51:43.867
And then afterwards, after the
defendants were all set to leave,

51:44.176 --> 51:48.578
Mrs McGuire suddenly decided
to raise her price.

51:48.603 --> 51:50.039
And then she

51:50.040 --> 51:52.466
wildly, drunken attacked,

51:52.491 --> 51:53.879
the defendants.

51:54.855 --> 51:57.800
My clients were simply
defending themselves.

51:58.437 --> 51:59.812
And then, they left.

51:59.837 --> 52:01.842
- Objection, your Honor.
- Overruled.

52:01.915 --> 52:05.579
My clients and they're companions were
drinking, they freely admit that.

52:06.778 --> 52:08.550
But at no time,

52:09.065 --> 52:10.623
at no time,

52:11.097 --> 52:12.270
were they aware

52:12.295 --> 52:14.731
of the presence of a 12 year old girl,

52:14.756 --> 52:16.885
who apparently hurt herself

52:16.886 --> 52:19.648
while she was crawling
into a storage area.

52:20.500 --> 52:24.142
And by her own testimony, admits,

52:24.167 --> 52:25.813
that at no time,

52:26.014 --> 52:30.193
did she ever actively
see any acts of rape,

52:30.194 --> 52:32.800
or any other crimes being committed.

52:33.148 --> 52:36.050
This was a confused
and frightened child.

52:36.213 --> 52:39.767
Whose mother was so derelict as a parent.

52:39.792 --> 52:40.847
Objection, your Honor.

52:40.848 --> 52:44.767
To drag her to a drunken orgy
of the Fourth of July party.

52:44.806 --> 52:46.338
Little Bethel McGuire,

52:46.746 --> 52:47.777
is a victim.

52:47.778 --> 52:49.963
- Your Honor, she was unconscious.
- Overruled!

52:49.988 --> 52:51.473
She's a victim.

52:51.920 --> 52:52.987
That's right.

52:53.097 --> 52:54.948
Of her mother's

52:54.973 --> 52:57.825
outrageous negligence.

52:58.395 --> 53:02.756
Who was so confused at the
time of the alleged rape.

53:02.798 --> 53:06.377
That she may have misled
her at a later time.

53:06.402 --> 53:08.396
Her testimony and her mother's

53:09.464 --> 53:11.870
is completely fabricated and misleading.

53:13.147 --> 53:16.532
As the evidence, and my
clients' testimony will show,

53:16.904 --> 53:19.487
They did not rape or assault anybody.

53:21.502 --> 53:23.416
They're completely innocent

53:23.758 --> 53:25.044
of all charges.

53:27.965 --> 53:28.965
No!

53:29.126 --> 53:30.273
No!

53:31.092 --> 53:32.899
No, no, no, no, no.

53:38.471 --> 53:39.527
Look at me.

53:51.150 --> 53:52.150
No!

53:53.135 --> 53:54.687
No, no!

53:55.730 --> 53:56.773
How?

53:56.798 --> 53:58.256
How can you do this?

53:58.281 --> 54:01.169
How can you do this to either of us?

54:05.394 --> 54:06.600
Somebody call an ambulance.

54:34.724 --> 54:36.037
Not too bad, huh?

55:14.578 --> 55:16.000
Your mom's gonna be OK.

55:16.402 --> 55:17.722
Gave something to sleep.

55:17.801 --> 55:19.628
At least through the night.

55:26.524 --> 55:28.042
Oh, not now, honey.

55:28.624 --> 55:31.186
- Give her some time.
- I just wanna see her.

55:34.208 --> 55:36.003
Bethie, the doctor's right.

55:36.692 --> 55:38.593
We need to let her rest, OK?

55:40.793 --> 55:42.729
You know? You should all get some rest.

55:43.035 --> 55:44.276
Sleep when she sleeps.

55:44.277 --> 55:45.295
Thank you.

55:52.218 --> 55:53.736
Oh, God...

55:54.943 --> 55:56.163
How is she doing?

55:56.246 --> 55:57.829
How do you think?

55:59.872 --> 56:00.875
Get out.

56:01.960 --> 56:03.023
Get out!

56:03.024 --> 56:04.114
Mrs Kevecki...

56:04.139 --> 56:05.233
You...

56:06.110 --> 56:07.222
promised...

56:07.578 --> 56:09.189
to protect Teena.

56:10.613 --> 56:12.378
You promised justice.

56:12.403 --> 56:13.498
And we're gonna get it.

56:13.499 --> 56:14.774
My daughter...

56:15.829 --> 56:17.113
is unwell.

56:18.043 --> 56:19.484
A trial would kill her.

56:22.909 --> 56:24.095
A trial would kill all of us.

56:24.096 --> 56:25.467
That's not gonna happen.

56:26.116 --> 56:27.985
The Kirkpatrick strategy

56:28.129 --> 56:30.868
is to try to manipulate the
jurors and the gallery.

56:30.894 --> 56:32.187
Well, it worked.

56:32.394 --> 56:34.589
Jurors want to vote not guilty.

56:34.590 --> 56:37.031
It's the generous
Christian thing to do.

56:37.032 --> 56:39.049
Oooh, is that supposed
to be encouraging?

56:39.050 --> 56:42.223
I'm ready for that, for Him.

56:42.541 --> 56:44.824
The women are being attacked.

56:45.004 --> 56:47.856
Rape must be punished, I'm not
gonna let them get away with this.

56:47.881 --> 56:49.709
Now, I need to see Teena.

56:50.469 --> 56:52.049
I need you to leave.

56:52.149 --> 56:53.305
Wait!

58:10.268 --> 58:11.685
Hey, can I get a beer?

58:23.549 --> 58:24.830
Are you OK?

58:31.977 --> 58:33.029
Sorry!

59:25.461 --> 59:26.893
You have a child.

59:30.078 --> 59:31.285
You have a daughter.

59:34.518 --> 59:36.930
We both know what it's like
to lose someone we love.

59:39.417 --> 59:41.417
Don't let her lose her mother too.

59:42.886 --> 59:44.819
Don't let her feel any more pain.

59:47.424 --> 59:49.162
Why do you care?

59:50.912 --> 59:53.392
Because you found me?

59:55.384 --> 59:58.170
Because you met me in a bar... once?

01:00:02.461 --> 01:00:03.793
You don't get it.

01:00:05.917 --> 01:00:07.701
They killed me already.

01:00:09.535 --> 01:00:11.621
They just didn't finish it.

01:00:16.746 --> 01:00:18.834
I'm moving very slowly.

01:00:42.801 --> 01:00:44.225
Thanks, Mrs Lewis.

01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:46.980
Give my love to your mum, honey,
I'm so glad she's feeling better.

01:00:46.981 --> 01:00:48.674
I will. Thanks.

01:00:48.786 --> 01:00:49.916
Bye, Annie.

01:01:13.411 --> 01:01:15.105
Here kitty, kitty. Kitty!

01:01:17.279 --> 01:01:18.865
Tiger Lily!

01:02:08.262 --> 01:02:09.981
Mamma, I thought you were asleep.

01:02:09.982 --> 01:02:11.468
She needed a ride home.

01:02:11.469 --> 01:02:13.281
Bethie, look at me.

01:02:13.794 --> 01:02:15.499
She's having a tough time.

01:02:16.030 --> 01:02:17.504
You gotta keep an eye on her.

01:02:17.616 --> 01:02:19.677
You gotta take real good care of her.

01:02:20.189 --> 01:02:22.830
I don't think she wants
anyone to take care of her.

01:02:25.893 --> 01:02:27.626
You give that to your mum for me.

01:02:27.651 --> 01:02:30.514
She can call anytime, day or night.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.579
Seven, O, Six...

01:02:44.995 --> 01:02:48.237
Three, Five, Eight. Right.

01:03:26.891 --> 01:03:28.928
Leave us alone!

01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:32.372
Miaow.

01:04:13.147 --> 01:04:14.504
They were here.

01:04:16.278 --> 01:04:17.987
Can you please help us?

01:04:24.078 --> 01:04:25.189
Thank you.

01:04:58.293 --> 01:04:59.523
Bethie Bear?

01:05:16.355 --> 01:05:17.970
Oooh, popcorn!

01:05:17.995 --> 01:05:19.418
A-ha!

01:05:19.426 --> 01:05:22.041
And not until after dinner.

01:05:22.959 --> 01:05:24.228
I love this kind.

01:05:33.884 --> 01:05:35.488
You seen Tiger Lily?

01:05:53.176 --> 01:05:55.061
Yes, come on!

01:05:56.271 --> 01:05:59.155
That's right! Make him bleed!

01:06:00.142 --> 01:06:01.169
Come on!

01:06:01.495 --> 01:06:05.430
Hey! Hey! Twenty bucks
says he goes down in six.

01:06:05.792 --> 01:06:07.460
Knock-out or TKO.

01:06:07.651 --> 01:06:10.051
Huh? How about it, asshole?
Twenty bucks.

01:06:10.638 --> 01:06:12.472
You don't got twenty bucks?

01:06:12.594 --> 01:06:14.090
Is that all you got?

01:06:17.617 --> 01:06:18.617
OK.

01:06:19.097 --> 01:06:20.097
OK.

01:06:21.911 --> 01:06:23.821
Fall... down!

01:06:23.846 --> 01:06:26.776
Come on! Call it!
Shithead's bleeding out!

01:06:28.606 --> 01:06:31.858
You're ready, shit-wipe?
Cos they're about to call it.

01:06:42.109 --> 01:06:43.394
Shit!

01:06:47.992 --> 01:06:49.307
Pay up!

01:07:01.142 --> 01:07:02.617
Relax, Jimmy!

01:07:03.331 --> 01:07:04.331
It's OK.

01:07:04.638 --> 01:07:05.698
It's OK.

01:07:07.855 --> 01:07:08.855
Hey.

01:07:10.654 --> 01:07:12.344
Spend it fast.

01:07:12.965 --> 01:07:14.676
Cos I'm gonna do you,

01:07:14.975 --> 01:07:18.259
just like I did Teena.

01:07:21.639 --> 01:07:22.646
What?

01:07:23.246 --> 01:07:26.027
Thought I didn't make you, Case?

01:07:27.924 --> 01:07:30.028
You think I don't know who you are?

01:07:30.084 --> 01:07:31.398
Jimmy?

01:07:35.054 --> 01:07:37.442
You want another Court date?

01:08:06.043 --> 01:08:08.142
Another one of these and a shot of Jack.

01:08:52.678 --> 01:08:54.966
- That's called a head, baby.
- Jimmy!

01:08:56.438 --> 01:08:58.349
Oh, that's a bitch!

01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:09.729
Stay back! Police!

01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:20.286
John Dromoor, badge 736, requesting
an ambulance and a coroner's wagon.

01:09:20.598 --> 01:09:22.045
Chippewa and 4th.

01:09:22.349 --> 01:09:23.785
And at the time of the shooting,

01:09:23.786 --> 01:09:26.517
you were entirely unaware
that this was James de Lucca.

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.457
Yes, Sir, no idea.

01:09:28.836 --> 01:09:31.778
You saw him less than
a month ago in Court.

01:09:32.487 --> 01:09:34.080
It was dark.

01:09:34.609 --> 01:09:35.779
He was brandishing a knife.

01:09:35.779 --> 01:09:37.412
And before in the bar?

01:09:37.662 --> 01:09:38.996
When he was watching the fight?

01:09:38.997 --> 01:09:40.339
I wasn't at the bar.

01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:42.292
I was at a table.

01:09:42.339 --> 01:09:45.948
So, John, when you fired your weapon,
it was purely self-defense, right?

01:09:46.009 --> 01:09:47.046
Yes, Sir.

01:09:49.118 --> 01:09:50.822
Three years in the service.

01:09:52.725 --> 01:09:54.193
Desert Storm.

01:09:54.438 --> 01:09:55.750
A Purple Heart.

01:09:58.721 --> 01:10:00.927
Rocky Point was your case, detective.

01:10:01.247 --> 01:10:03.210
So, you're telling me at
the time of the shooting

01:10:03.211 --> 01:10:05.974
you had no idea about Raymond Casey's
connection with Marteen McGuire?

01:10:05.975 --> 01:10:07.564
Just a name on a file.

01:10:07.610 --> 01:10:09.507
My partner did the interview.

01:10:10.582 --> 01:10:11.874
Name on a file?

01:10:13.485 --> 01:10:14.772
Coincidence?

01:10:14.850 --> 01:10:16.176
Come on, John.

01:10:16.417 --> 01:10:19.073
You, Casey and de Lucca in
a parking lot together?

01:10:19.136 --> 01:10:20.136
No.

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:22.653
No coincidence.

01:10:23.361 --> 01:10:25.943
More like... it was meant to be.

01:10:26.715 --> 01:10:27.735
Like...

01:10:28.328 --> 01:10:29.744
If there is a God...

01:10:32.673 --> 01:10:35.040
In retrospect it felt like...

01:10:38.314 --> 01:10:39.954
I had a purpose.

01:10:41.633 --> 01:10:43.952
And what was that purpose, John?

01:10:46.182 --> 01:10:47.204
John?

01:10:49.341 --> 01:10:52.289
To discharge my sworn duty
as an officer of the law.

01:11:10.042 --> 01:11:12.340
Next week, Friday, 9 AM.

01:11:12.341 --> 01:11:13.350
Works for me.

01:11:13.351 --> 01:11:15.130
Well, Haaber's attorney
can't do the sixth.

01:11:15.155 --> 01:11:19.728
Council for Haaber is in Court on
another matter but I have his power.

01:11:19.729 --> 01:11:21.632
Next week is impossible.

01:11:21.842 --> 01:11:23.398
Sadly...

01:11:24.038 --> 01:11:26.437
de Lucca's power, we won't be needing.

01:11:26.438 --> 01:11:28.211
Your Honor, I need more time.

01:11:28.236 --> 01:11:29.642
This is not a discussion.

01:11:30.293 --> 01:11:32.279
Mr Kirkpatrick's
clients have exercised

01:11:32.304 --> 01:11:34.512
their 6th Amendment Right
to a speedy trial.

01:11:34.537 --> 01:11:36.789
Speed is my middle name.

01:11:36.814 --> 01:11:38.336
And that's the day.

01:12:06.730 --> 01:12:08.577
All right, here's the deal.

01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:12.691
Lose the rape one and
the predatory assaults

01:12:12.885 --> 01:12:16.131
drop the agg assaults to
misdo's and we're done.

01:12:17.444 --> 01:12:19.055
Misdemeanor assault?

01:12:21.576 --> 01:12:23.827
The Ficks plead on two counts.

01:12:24.516 --> 01:12:26.425
For Teena, for the kid.

01:12:27.088 --> 01:12:30.405
18 months each on each
count... consecutive.

01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:31.931
Three years guaranteed.

01:12:34.107 --> 01:12:36.102
Have you seen Teena McGuire?

01:12:36.127 --> 01:12:38.364
Have you seen what they did to her?

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:42.513
Have you?

01:12:43.847 --> 01:12:47.214
Since the hearing, have
you even talked to her?

01:12:50.532 --> 01:12:51.967
But you've tried.

01:12:53.015 --> 01:12:54.724
Went by the house...

01:12:54.951 --> 01:12:57.593
Sweet-talked the mum, the kid...

01:12:58.584 --> 01:13:02.815
Oh, I promise, I promise it'll
all be different in trial.

01:13:05.014 --> 01:13:08.449
The hearing was the trial.

01:13:08.754 --> 01:13:10.285
It's over.

01:13:12.633 --> 01:13:14.839
Teena's not coming back to Court.

01:13:16.916 --> 01:13:18.584
Not by Friday.

01:13:21.695 --> 01:13:23.137
You son of a bitch.

01:13:23.690 --> 01:13:28.652
No victim, no witness, that's a
hard case to win in any venue.

01:13:29.387 --> 01:13:31.387
And this town by next week?

01:13:32.690 --> 01:13:34.337
The case is dismissed.

01:13:43.153 --> 01:13:45.280
What happened to winning this?

01:13:47.231 --> 01:13:48.891
A Jury trial.

01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:50.592
No guarantees.

01:13:51.843 --> 01:13:53.862
I had to finish my shift.

01:13:54.399 --> 01:13:57.432
He wants to make a deal.
Jail. Three years.

01:13:57.433 --> 01:13:59.698
I'm presenting an option.

01:13:59.699 --> 01:14:02.772
Do you not hear yourself?
We are the victims.

01:14:02.773 --> 01:14:05.292
That drunk bitch came on
to us, selling her ass.

01:14:05.293 --> 01:14:07.452
You said, you said that...
we were, we all agreed

01:14:07.453 --> 01:14:10.947
we were messed up and then the
cops went looking for the wrong guys.

01:14:10.948 --> 01:14:13.445
Three years sound pretty
good to me, considering.

01:14:13.446 --> 01:14:16.156
Considering what? They didn't do it!

01:14:16.551 --> 01:14:21.105
Mrs Fick, in a Jury trial...
there's always a risk.

01:14:21.359 --> 01:14:25.898
And a good attorney
advises you of that risk.

01:14:26.525 --> 01:14:27.892
If we lose...

01:14:27.893 --> 01:14:29.967
We're not going to lose,
that's the whole point!

01:14:29.968 --> 01:14:33.257
It's 20 years in State Prison, minimum.

01:14:33.258 --> 01:14:37.095
No, no, no, no... Jail is jail, been
there, done that, I ain't going back.

01:14:37.475 --> 01:14:40.286
We're on! I swear to Christ!

01:14:40.453 --> 01:14:41.716
Canada! We'll go to Canada.

01:14:41.717 --> 01:14:43.416
No, no, no, you won't.

01:14:43.804 --> 01:14:46.000
I put up my damned house.

01:14:48.552 --> 01:14:50.807
You don't have to decide right now.

01:14:51.309 --> 01:14:53.119
Talk it over as a family.

01:14:53.296 --> 01:14:54.559
We've decided.

01:14:54.977 --> 01:14:57.984
Teena McGuire is a lying whore,
no-one's gonna believer her.

01:14:58.350 --> 01:15:02.234
My boys are not pleading guilty
to something they did not do.

01:15:02.235 --> 01:15:03.409
That's it!

01:15:03.873 --> 01:15:05.936
Innocent people don't do time.

01:15:44.331 --> 01:15:45.698
You gonna cry, bitch?

01:15:45.868 --> 01:15:47.304
No, bitch.

01:15:47.721 --> 01:15:49.163
No, bitch.

01:15:53.472 --> 01:15:54.594
Start talking.

01:15:56.206 --> 01:15:57.408
Yeah, you got him.

01:16:06.376 --> 01:16:07.376
Yeah.

01:16:07.616 --> 01:16:08.966
Yeah, I just need the...

01:16:09.001 --> 01:16:10.916
Now, we see an apple pie right above it.

01:16:11.027 --> 01:16:12.117
I gotta get a pie.

01:16:12.142 --> 01:16:13.649
I have to get a pie, I would love it.

01:16:13.945 --> 01:16:15.012
Hm?

01:16:15.013 --> 01:16:17.978
Look, I can have a pie right above the
top with squiggly lines coming out?

01:16:17.979 --> 01:16:21.684
Like it's still hot, like you
just took a pie out of the oven?

01:16:21.948 --> 01:16:23.372
- Cos...
- Hm.

01:16:23.373 --> 01:16:24.373
Yeah.

01:16:24.535 --> 01:16:25.948
- I like it.
- OK.

01:16:26.491 --> 01:16:30.662
Cos my mum, she got me a pie, she
made a pie one time for my birthday.

01:16:30.663 --> 01:16:34.440
Instead of her getting a pie,
which Marvin...

01:16:34.441 --> 01:16:35.969
Marvin, remember the birthday pie?

01:16:36.730 --> 01:16:39.037
- Remember the birthday pie?
- Shut up, dipshit.

01:16:39.062 --> 01:16:40.062
Yeah.

01:16:40.736 --> 01:16:43.618
Yeah, she, she made me a pie for...

01:16:43.643 --> 01:16:44.643
Go again?

01:16:44.668 --> 01:16:46.901
I didn't eat it in time so
the candles had melted.

01:16:46.926 --> 01:16:50.094
So I ate with... and I got
to wax out of my teeth,

01:16:50.095 --> 01:16:53.123
and I didn't brush my teeth so they were
stuck in my teeth for about a week.

01:16:53.147 --> 01:16:54.207
- OK, Lloyd?
- Yeah?

01:16:54.232 --> 01:16:56.457
- You gotta stay still.
- Gotcha.

01:16:58.749 --> 01:16:59.808
Right.

01:17:08.218 --> 01:17:09.535
What's up, dog?

01:17:12.623 --> 01:17:14.152
Everything good on the phone?

01:17:14.177 --> 01:17:15.615
We'd better be going, baby.

01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:16.640
Oh.

01:17:18.716 --> 01:17:20.009
You remember the pie?

01:17:21.924 --> 01:17:23.591
You remember the pie.

01:17:23.701 --> 01:17:24.929
I remember the belt.

01:17:24.964 --> 01:17:26.484
We're meeting an investigator?

01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:28.724
Legal investigator.

01:17:28.884 --> 01:17:30.180
Works for Kirkpatrick.

01:17:31.624 --> 01:17:33.915
I don't get why we're going
to meet him, though.

01:17:33.916 --> 01:17:36.140
You don't get shit.
That's why they called me.

01:17:37.494 --> 01:17:39.261
No, I just... Ah, my dick!

01:17:39.286 --> 01:17:41.635
Yo, I almost frigging
burned my dick off.

01:17:41.868 --> 01:17:45.146
No, I don't get why he called ...you.

01:17:45.646 --> 01:17:48.622
Like why can't Kirkpatrick come and
get this on his own, you know?

01:17:48.713 --> 01:17:51.885
Bitch, Kirkpatrick is an officer of
the Court. These guys stay clean.

01:17:53.615 --> 01:17:56.121
I told your ass!
Everything that criminates their side

01:17:56.146 --> 01:17:58.051
cannot come from our lawyer.

01:17:58.756 --> 01:18:00.157
And this criminates...?

01:18:00.299 --> 01:18:02.632
We're about to get the evidence...?

01:18:02.633 --> 01:18:05.330
That criminates the
shit out of Teena, yes!

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:07.792
He's got proof that
she sold her pussy...

01:18:07.793 --> 01:18:09.140
Pussy likes it rough...

01:18:09.165 --> 01:18:11.272
pictures, sworn statements.

01:18:11.273 --> 01:18:14.064
- But this is good.
- This is good as shit, yeah.

01:18:20.350 --> 01:18:21.415
There he is.

01:18:28.933 --> 01:18:30.090
He's gone.

01:18:30.607 --> 01:18:32.132
So, now what? He gets out?

01:18:32.925 --> 01:18:34.766
No, now you get out.

01:18:34.767 --> 01:18:36.510
- I get out?
- You get the stuff.

01:18:38.336 --> 01:18:40.050
You want me to get out in this rain?

01:18:40.072 --> 01:18:41.352
Yeah, bro!

01:18:41.872 --> 01:18:42.968
I got...

01:18:42.969 --> 01:18:45.033
Judas Priest, little brother!
Where'd you get that?

01:18:45.058 --> 01:18:46.755
I know a guy that...

01:18:46.953 --> 01:18:48.446
- Oh, you know a guy?
- Yeah.

01:18:48.447 --> 01:18:50.530
Good for you, John Wayne. Get out!

01:18:50.531 --> 01:18:54.032
OK! Fuck! What the fuck did I
do now for you to act like that?

01:18:54.618 --> 01:18:57.568
You never listen to me when
I tell you to do shit.

01:18:57.659 --> 01:18:59.263
What are you yelling at me for?

01:19:00.389 --> 01:19:02.184
No, no, he's not inside!

01:19:02.209 --> 01:19:04.488
- What?
- He's not inside!

01:19:06.106 --> 01:19:07.317
Well, check!

01:19:08.728 --> 01:19:11.185
There's an envelope.
I'm grabbing this envelope.

01:19:12.514 --> 01:19:14.158
Yo, it says...

01:19:14.939 --> 01:19:15.990
I think this is...

01:19:17.156 --> 01:19:18.235
What?

01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:19.549
It says "Ficks, confidential..."

01:19:23.233 --> 01:19:25.108
No, no, no, who is this? Huh?

01:19:29.561 --> 01:19:30.818
You, son of a bitch!

01:19:30.819 --> 01:19:32.525
We'll settle this!

01:19:54.664 --> 01:19:58.357
Officer 567 requesting.

01:19:58.382 --> 01:20:00.595
Hey partner, the keys
are in the ignition.

01:20:02.018 --> 01:20:04.913
New York State vehicle tag,
India, Seven Two,

01:20:05.578 --> 01:20:08.391
- Romeo, Oscar, Roger, over...
- Copy that.

01:20:08.652 --> 01:20:11.993
I got a case of beer... three are left.

01:20:13.858 --> 01:20:15.383
Hiking charts?

01:20:18.058 --> 01:20:19.747
The Canadian side is missing.

01:20:28.076 --> 01:20:30.960
Get off my property! This is a private
property, you're trespassing.

01:20:30.961 --> 01:20:32.040
Get out of here!

01:20:32.041 --> 01:20:34.952
You got any relatives in Canada?
Friends? Some place where they might go?

01:20:34.953 --> 01:20:37.427
These are my boys, they wouldn't
do this. Something happened!

01:20:37.428 --> 01:20:38.971
We lost our house.

01:20:39.037 --> 01:20:40.531
That's what happened.

01:20:40.556 --> 01:20:43.199
No, they wouldn't run! I'm telling you.
They wouldn't do this.

01:20:43.224 --> 01:20:44.784
Walt get back out here!

01:20:44.809 --> 01:20:46.719
Mrs Fick, have you heard from them?

01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:47.958
I'm their mother.

01:20:47.959 --> 01:20:50.184
They would've let me know.
They would tell me something.

01:20:50.208 --> 01:20:52.125
Do you think we will
hear from your sons?

01:20:52.150 --> 01:20:54.369
All right.
You wanna know what happened?

01:20:54.394 --> 01:20:55.649
I'll tell you!

01:20:55.736 --> 01:20:58.234
It's that bitch Teena McGuire.

01:20:58.235 --> 01:21:01.744
She's the one who drove my boys away!

01:21:01.769 --> 01:21:03.085
Get out of here!

01:21:03.605 --> 01:21:04.605
They're gone!

01:21:05.294 --> 01:21:06.725
They're outlaws!

01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:07.901
They're...

01:21:08.172 --> 01:21:10.986
There you have it.
Outlaws or fugitives.

01:21:16.825 --> 01:21:17.841
Mamma!

01:21:18.877 --> 01:21:19.935
Mum!

01:21:23.175 --> 01:21:25.510
The Ficks... gone. They're gone.

01:21:25.511 --> 01:21:27.062
[IF YOU BELIEVE YOU
MAY HAVE SEEN THEM,

01:21:31.538 --> 01:21:34.017
Erm... doesn't break my heart.

01:21:34.394 --> 01:21:36.758
Yeah? But what if they come back?

01:21:38.696 --> 01:21:40.098
Honey, they won't.

01:21:40.232 --> 01:21:41.287
They could.

01:21:42.772 --> 01:21:46.145
You listen to me: They
will never hurt us again.

01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:47.707
I promise!

01:21:48.099 --> 01:21:49.125
Bethie!

01:21:49.564 --> 01:21:50.564
OK.

01:21:51.675 --> 01:21:52.675
OK.

01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:55.595
Heading to the mall.

01:21:56.056 --> 01:21:58.722
Anyone wanna join me
for a bit of shopping?

01:21:58.955 --> 01:21:59.972
I do!

01:22:01.953 --> 01:22:03.757
Can we get some food along the way?

01:22:03.782 --> 01:22:05.570
Only if you're driving.

01:22:05.595 --> 01:22:07.685
Hmm, I guess I'm driving.

01:22:07.710 --> 01:22:08.790
Thanks, mom.

01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:12.543
Come on, grandma.

01:22:13.648 --> 01:22:14.925
Come on!

01:22:32.387 --> 01:22:34.409
Like.. are you really like Bethie Bear?

01:22:34.410 --> 01:22:36.801
We're not the same, I'm shorter.

01:22:36.826 --> 01:22:40.091
- We're similar.
- Oh, look at this!

01:22:41.612 --> 01:22:43.474
They are so cute.

01:22:43.570 --> 01:22:46.174
Hmm, too bad they don't
have them in my size.

01:22:48.182 --> 01:22:49.919
I will check with her.

01:23:02.411 --> 01:23:04.059
Listen to me now,

01:23:04.452 --> 01:23:06.118
before the boat house,

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:09.175
before they raped your mum,

01:23:09.567 --> 01:23:12.652
I was gone. That's
what you say in Court.

01:23:12.677 --> 01:23:13.861
Don't forget it.

01:23:13.886 --> 01:23:15.509
Hey! They got them!

01:23:19.322 --> 01:23:20.356
Bethie!

01:23:20.357 --> 01:23:21.833
What'd just happened, honey?

01:23:21.834 --> 01:23:23.046
Sweetheart?

01:23:23.884 --> 01:23:24.898
Shh, hey!

01:23:24.923 --> 01:23:25.923
Talk to me?

01:23:26.207 --> 01:23:27.207
Bethie?

01:23:27.232 --> 01:23:29.073
Bethie! Bethie!

01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:33.016
Hey! How'd you guys get on?

01:23:33.187 --> 01:23:34.187
Bethie?

01:23:34.954 --> 01:23:35.972
What happened?

01:23:35.973 --> 01:23:38.557
- I don't know, she's...
- I'll go check on her.

01:23:38.582 --> 01:23:39.784
Thank you.

01:23:40.043 --> 01:23:41.122
Bethie!

01:23:58.167 --> 01:23:59.209
Hello?

01:23:59.238 --> 01:24:00.635
Fritz Haaber?

01:24:00.996 --> 01:24:02.315
Who wants to know?

01:24:04.245 --> 01:24:05.771
It is you.

01:24:06.131 --> 01:24:09.784
I don't know if you remember me,
Lou Ellen Drought?

01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:12.711
I was a few years behind
you in High School.

01:24:13.793 --> 01:24:14.908
Lou Ellen?

01:24:16.270 --> 01:24:17.362
Yeah.

01:24:18.072 --> 01:24:19.678
Yeah, Lou Ellen?

01:24:20.469 --> 01:24:21.697
Welcome back.

01:24:21.698 --> 01:24:24.702
I heard you had a little bit of trouble

01:24:24.703 --> 01:24:26.535
and I think I can help you out.

01:24:26.536 --> 01:24:29.300
I know some things
about Teena McGuire.

01:24:29.301 --> 01:24:32.157
Things a Jury should know.

01:24:32.473 --> 01:24:34.758
Well, maybe... you should tell me.

01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:38.343
My daughter and I are staying
at the Blackburn's Motel.

01:24:41.909 --> 01:24:43.702
Yeah, I know that dive well.

01:24:44.799 --> 01:24:48.218
You should come meet my
daughter and we can talk.

01:24:48.832 --> 01:24:51.688
11 PM, room 24.

01:24:53.344 --> 01:24:56.304
Yeah, I look forward to meeting
your daughter as well.

01:25:47.419 --> 01:25:48.730
Lou Ellen?

01:25:59.770 --> 01:26:01.189
♪ Lou Ellen? ♪

01:26:19.342 --> 01:26:20.342
Sit.

01:26:24.415 --> 01:26:25.532
Write.

01:26:28.527 --> 01:26:29.738
Write what?

01:26:30.228 --> 01:26:31.853
God, forgive me...

01:26:32.111 --> 01:26:35.061
I did what I believed was
the right thing to do.

01:26:36.155 --> 01:26:37.840
Why would I write that?

01:26:57.732 --> 01:26:59.330
Keep going, finish it.

01:27:19.526 --> 01:27:20.738
Happy?

01:27:21.837 --> 01:27:23.562
Put your hand on the gun.

01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:25.950
No.

01:27:32.805 --> 01:27:34.825
Put your hand on the gun.

01:28:05.672 --> 01:28:08.137
Guess who snapped himself last night?

01:28:08.498 --> 01:28:09.498
Boom!

01:28:10.191 --> 01:28:11.353
Rocky Point.

01:28:11.408 --> 01:28:12.720
Fritz Haaber.

01:28:16.301 --> 01:28:18.002
You should send him flowers.

01:28:33.133 --> 01:28:34.133
Mom?

01:28:35.226 --> 01:28:36.226
Mom!

01:28:36.361 --> 01:28:37.430
She's outside.

01:28:37.455 --> 01:28:38.675
D'you need her?

01:28:38.833 --> 01:28:40.241
Yeah, we need some more boxes.

01:28:40.266 --> 01:28:42.470
I thought we had some
stashed in your closet.

01:28:42.805 --> 01:28:44.990
We used the last ones last night.

01:28:45.114 --> 01:28:46.516
- Sorry.
- No.

01:28:46.718 --> 01:28:48.385
It's not your fault.

01:28:49.585 --> 01:28:51.113
Are you ready for this?

01:28:52.114 --> 01:28:53.277
Yeah.

01:28:54.021 --> 01:28:55.029
I am.

01:28:55.423 --> 01:28:56.503
Are you sure?

01:28:57.461 --> 01:28:59.035
I'm ready for...

01:28:59.635 --> 01:29:00.737
a change.

01:29:00.954 --> 01:29:01.954
Me too.

01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:08.779
Where are you going?

01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:10.433
I was gonna say bye to Annie?

01:29:10.772 --> 01:29:13.707
I also wanted to make one last stop.

01:29:20.250 --> 01:29:22.006
You wanna come with me?

01:29:28.031 --> 01:29:30.005
You think I'm the bad guy?

01:29:30.208 --> 01:29:32.382
Because I defend men
that you think are...

01:29:32.383 --> 01:29:33.631
Scum.

01:29:36.156 --> 01:29:37.381
You know, John?

01:29:37.756 --> 01:29:39.477
We have a document
in this country,

01:29:39.502 --> 01:29:40.940
it's called the Constitution?

01:29:41.145 --> 01:29:42.812
And in that document,

01:29:42.909 --> 01:29:46.278
it expressly provides my services for...

01:29:46.661 --> 01:29:48.141
all citizens.

01:29:48.425 --> 01:29:49.790
Even criminals.

01:29:51.563 --> 01:29:53.953
What's not in that document,

01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:57.244
is vigilante cop justice.

01:29:58.977 --> 01:30:01.845
Even for cold-blooded murderers.

01:30:05.387 --> 01:30:07.420
Maybe they had it coming.

01:30:09.372 --> 01:30:10.735
Maybe they didn't.

01:30:11.219 --> 01:30:13.106
Guess we'll never know now.

01:30:16.159 --> 01:30:17.235
Who knows?

01:30:17.939 --> 01:30:21.015
You might even need my services someday.

01:30:23.941 --> 01:30:25.442
And I hope,

01:30:25.854 --> 01:30:27.964
you'll never need mine.

01:31:28.071 --> 01:31:29.106
Hey.

01:31:31.914 --> 01:31:33.869
I told once before,

01:31:34.723 --> 01:31:36.837
I don't a lot of real life heroes.

01:31:38.188 --> 01:31:39.753
Your daughter is the hero.

01:31:40.659 --> 01:31:41.811
Sorry.

01:31:42.656 --> 01:31:44.429
I'll give you guys a moment.

01:31:44.926 --> 01:31:46.334
You're alright?

01:31:46.951 --> 01:31:48.713
She seems stronger.

01:31:49.214 --> 01:31:50.244
She's fine.

01:31:50.269 --> 01:31:52.186
Well, not fine but better.

01:31:52.591 --> 01:31:54.637
You've been taking good care of her.

01:31:54.883 --> 01:31:56.709
You wanna come to the station?

01:31:56.791 --> 01:31:57.830
No.

01:31:57.855 --> 01:31:59.003
Come on around at the gate.

01:31:59.004 --> 01:32:00.395
We're leaving.

01:32:01.185 --> 01:32:02.506
Tomorrow...

01:32:03.229 --> 01:32:04.603
California.

01:32:05.027 --> 01:32:08.181
I came to say good-bye,
we came to say good-bye.

01:32:08.810 --> 01:32:10.147
And thank you.

01:32:11.804 --> 01:32:13.199
That day,

01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:16.607
you brought her home.

01:32:16.632 --> 01:32:17.722
Bethie...

01:32:18.534 --> 01:32:20.573
I just gave her a ride.

01:32:21.255 --> 01:32:22.780
It was so bad.

01:32:23.237 --> 01:32:24.807
I've seen bad things.

01:32:26.008 --> 01:32:28.094
Things I thought I'd never forget.

01:32:28.946 --> 01:32:30.603
We do forget.

01:32:31.186 --> 01:32:33.084
Not all the way but...

01:32:33.336 --> 01:32:35.124
enough so you can move on.

01:32:35.493 --> 01:32:36.817
Leaving here?

01:32:37.017 --> 01:32:38.452
That's smart.

01:32:39.636 --> 01:32:42.298
There's a lot more
sunshine in California.

01:32:45.229 --> 01:32:46.573
I love you.

01:32:52.166 --> 01:32:53.346
You know?

01:32:53.371 --> 01:32:55.051
I never had a daughter.

01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:57.993
You've never been married.

01:32:58.566 --> 01:32:59.665
Have you?

01:33:01.758 --> 01:33:03.202
I'll tell you something.

01:33:03.907 --> 01:33:05.965
If I ever do have a daughter.

01:33:06.967 --> 01:33:09.550
I hope she grows up
to be just like you.

01:33:10.451 --> 01:33:12.016
Everyday.

01:33:16.449 --> 01:33:18.942
All right then, good-bye.
