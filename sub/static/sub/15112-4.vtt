WEBVTT

00:03.452 --> 00:04.852
(Grunts)

00:06.560 --> 00:08.895
Hey, come on, guys!

00:08.929 --> 00:10.146
Come on!

00:10.180 --> 00:11.147
Hey!

00:11.181 --> 00:13.516
Hey, hey,
get off him! (Grunts)

00:13.550 --> 00:15.101
(Crowd gasps)

00:15.152 --> 00:16.486
Cole:
What's wrong with you?

00:16.520 --> 00:18.438
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean it.

00:18.489 --> 00:20.440
What the hell's going on?

00:20.474 --> 00:22.108
He used one of my rackets

00:22.159 --> 00:23.409
without asking
and he broke it.

00:23.444 --> 00:25.044
So you tackle him?

00:25.079 --> 00:26.629
I already said
I'd pay for it.

00:26.663 --> 00:28.131
You use my racket
all the time.

00:28.165 --> 00:29.298
What's the big deal?

00:32.034 --> 00:33.553
Whoa, where do you think
you're going?

00:33.587 --> 00:36.055
Principal's office. Isn't that
where you were going to send me?

00:36.090 --> 00:37.924
(School bell rings)

00:37.975 --> 00:40.793
I said I'd apologize.

00:40.828 --> 00:42.345
What else do you
want from me?

00:42.379 --> 00:44.647
I'd like to know what the hell
happened out there.

00:44.681 --> 00:46.382
Rex:
He broke my racket.

00:46.416 --> 00:49.102
That's an excuse.
That's not an explanation.

00:49.153 --> 00:50.570
Look, this isn't like you.

00:50.604 --> 00:51.821
How do you know?

00:51.855 --> 00:54.157
And if you think you're going
to suspend me from the team,

00:54.191 --> 00:55.691
don't bother.
I quit.

00:55.725 --> 00:57.360
No one wants to see you quit.

00:58.562 --> 01:00.113
- Rex.
- What?

01:00.164 --> 01:02.582
Come on.

01:02.616 --> 01:05.001
Can we just go?

01:06.420 --> 01:09.622
(School bell rings)

01:09.673 --> 01:11.674
Evans:
<i>Now you understand</i>

01:11.708 --> 01:13.926
that anger is a typical response

01:13.961 --> 01:15.928
for a child
who's experienced something

01:15.963 --> 01:18.264
as tragic and unjust
as losing a parent.

01:18.298 --> 01:20.766
Well, he's acting out
in other ways.

01:20.801 --> 01:23.686
He's missing school.
He's dropping grades.

01:23.720 --> 01:25.521
How are you handling that?

01:25.556 --> 01:27.356
Not well.

01:27.391 --> 01:29.692
I mean, I try and help and...

01:29.726 --> 01:31.527
He won't let me in.

01:31.562 --> 01:32.778
And, uh...

01:32.813 --> 01:34.981
(Sighs)

01:35.032 --> 01:37.099
I feel...

01:37.117 --> 01:39.485
What?

01:40.937 --> 01:42.505
...helpless.

01:42.539 --> 01:45.024
Evans: Has it occurred to
you that part of why you're

01:45.058 --> 01:47.326
finding it difficult to help
your son is because

01:47.377 --> 01:51.547
you haven't truly accepted
what he's experiencing.

01:51.582 --> 01:53.782
Of course I have.

01:53.800 --> 01:57.220
Do you believe your wife
is dead, detective Britten?

02:03.393 --> 02:05.344
Evans:
<i>I wonder if this isn't why</i>

02:05.395 --> 02:09.764
<i>you're having such difficulty</i>
<i>connecting with Rex.</i>

02:09.799 --> 02:13.853
<i>Now how can you expect to help</i>
<i>your son through his loss</i>

02:13.904 --> 02:16.572
<i>when you're in denial</i>
<i>over that same loss?</i>

02:21.745 --> 02:24.280
Britten: Why's the media
so interested in this?

02:24.314 --> 02:26.499
Well, yacht belongs
to a couple of guys

02:26.533 --> 02:28.451
who own some
tech firm up North.

02:28.485 --> 02:32.004
One of them is engaged
to a famous lingerie model.

02:32.039 --> 02:33.656
She and her model friends
were on board

02:33.674 --> 02:36.125
when the victim drowned.

02:36.159 --> 02:39.262
Paparazzi hear someone died
next to a celebrity,

02:39.296 --> 02:41.297
this is what you get.

02:43.967 --> 02:45.601
Vega: She friends with
whoever was famous?

02:45.636 --> 02:47.520
Bryce:
No, her names Annie Yang.

02:47.554 --> 02:48.837
She worked for one of the guys

02:48.855 --> 02:51.107
who owned the boat.

02:51.141 --> 02:52.942
They were a couple Miles
offshore partying,

02:52.976 --> 02:56.062
doing 17 knots when she
jumped from a stateroom.

02:56.113 --> 02:57.846
Couple crew went in
after her but, uh,

02:57.864 --> 02:59.615
she was dead by the time
they hauled her in.

02:59.650 --> 03:01.617
Anyone see her go over?

03:01.652 --> 03:04.153
No, all anyone saw was
when she actually hit the water.

03:04.187 --> 03:05.488
How many are we talking about,

03:05.522 --> 03:07.189
and why are they
getting off the boat?

03:07.207 --> 03:08.791
Almost a hundred,
but we're holding them all

03:08.825 --> 03:10.459
at the end of the dock for you.

03:10.494 --> 03:12.378
A hundred witnesses
who didn't witness

03:12.412 --> 03:14.380
what may or may not be
an actual crime.

03:14.414 --> 03:16.549
This is shaping up
to be a great night.

03:18.568 --> 03:20.219
Lee:
<i>So tell me how this works.</i>

03:20.254 --> 03:22.538
Britten: <i>I'm awake with my
wife, and I close my eyes,</i>

03:22.556 --> 03:24.974
<i>I open them,</i>
<i>I'm awake with my son.</i>

03:25.008 --> 03:27.893
And this has been happening
since the accident?

03:29.396 --> 03:31.614
Lee: <i>So you begin working on one case</i>

03:31.648 --> 03:33.866
<i>here in reality,</i>
<i>and then suddenly</i>

03:33.900 --> 03:36.986
<i>you begin working another case</i>
<i>there in your dream.</i>

03:37.020 --> 03:38.554
Britten: <i>It all feels
completely real to me.</i>

03:38.572 --> 03:41.440
Lee: <i>You can't tell whether
you're awake or asleep</i>

03:41.491 --> 03:42.441
at this very moment?

03:42.492 --> 03:43.693
Evans:
<i>Well, I can assure you,</i>

03:43.727 --> 03:45.528
detective Britten,
this is not a dream.

03:45.562 --> 03:48.197
That's exactly
what the other shrink said.

03:49.732 --> 03:51.832
AWAKE
S01 Ep04 - Kate Is Enough

03:52.370 --> 03:55.870
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

03:57.317 --> 03:59.617
All right guys, 
give me some space, please.

04:00.111 --> 04:01.511
Thank you.

04:02.449 --> 04:04.000
Oh.

04:09.289 --> 04:10.873
Wow.

04:15.762 --> 04:18.831
Ugh. Looks like she had trouble
keeping everything down.

04:26.339 --> 04:27.890
Guess this is where
she went over.

04:27.924 --> 04:31.193
Yeah, they said the gate was
opened when they came up.

04:38.985 --> 04:40.953
Vega:
What?

04:40.987 --> 04:42.321
The handle's clean.

04:42.355 --> 04:43.873
Okay.

04:43.907 --> 04:45.324
She opens the gate,
but she doesn't

04:45.358 --> 04:47.192
leave any kind of print?
Not even a smudge?

04:47.210 --> 04:48.694
Well, maybe she bumped into it.

04:48.712 --> 04:51.747
Maybe she... she didn't mean
to commit suicide after all.

04:51.782 --> 04:53.132
She was was wasted.

04:53.166 --> 04:55.751
You know, hit it.
Went in.

04:55.802 --> 04:58.421
Yeah, or maybe somebody
opened it for her,

04:58.455 --> 04:59.972
and wiped it down afterwards.

05:00.006 --> 05:02.174
Isn't that a reach?

05:02.208 --> 05:05.061
Detectives, we got the guys
who own the boat.

05:05.095 --> 05:06.562
We've taken their statements,

05:06.596 --> 05:10.382
but if you have a few minutes to
sit, they'd like to talk to you.

05:10.400 --> 05:13.602
Bryce: Gentleman, detectives
Britten and Vega.

05:15.221 --> 05:17.073
I'm Cameron Fuller.

05:17.107 --> 05:19.191
Darin, Darin Knox.

05:19.225 --> 05:21.193
Uh, Ms. Yang
worked for you, right?

05:21.227 --> 05:22.027
Not me.

05:22.061 --> 05:23.662
Annie was my assistant.

05:26.733 --> 05:29.869
We were also
sleeping together.

05:31.855 --> 05:34.123
Except he neglected to
mention that to the officer

05:34.174 --> 05:37.793
who interviewed him, so I told
him, he better tell you.

05:37.844 --> 05:39.512
Why didn't you mention it?

05:39.546 --> 05:41.680
I was ashamed, okay?

05:41.715 --> 05:43.933
You're the one that's engaged
to this celebrity?

05:43.967 --> 05:45.050
Yeah, that's correct.

05:45.084 --> 05:46.585
Britten:
So, what happened?

05:46.603 --> 05:48.754
I told Annie this morning
that...

05:48.772 --> 05:50.439
That we need to end things.

05:50.474 --> 05:53.159
And, uh, she seemed okay.

05:53.193 --> 05:55.227
But tonight

05:55.261 --> 05:56.729
after she'd been drinking,

05:56.763 --> 05:59.865
it was pretty obvious
that she wasn't.

05:59.900 --> 06:01.700
What was she doing?

06:01.735 --> 06:03.702
Embarrassing herself.

06:03.737 --> 06:05.371
She was all over camera.

06:05.405 --> 06:08.240
I told him to take her to a
stateroom and put her to bed,

06:08.274 --> 06:10.376
where she made it worse.

06:10.410 --> 06:11.577
And was that difficult?

06:11.611 --> 06:13.379
Did she resist?

06:13.413 --> 06:14.279
No.

06:14.297 --> 06:15.748
The opposite, actually.

06:15.782 --> 06:17.530
She thought I wanted
to sleep with her.

06:17.531 --> 06:17.967
Uh-huh.

06:18.001 --> 06:19.251
I told her
that I couldn't

06:19.285 --> 06:22.755
and we argued for a bit,
but she was so drunk.

06:24.007 --> 06:25.290
When I left, she was asleep.

06:25.308 --> 06:27.176
So, I thought she'd be fine.

06:27.227 --> 06:32.097
And where were you
when she went overboard?

06:32.131 --> 06:33.632
I was on the deck
with Monique.

06:33.650 --> 06:35.133
That's...?

06:35.152 --> 06:36.185
My fiancée.

06:36.236 --> 06:38.470
And about
20 other people.

06:38.488 --> 06:40.723
And I was talking
to some investors when...

06:44.110 --> 06:46.144
I wanted to jump in after her.

06:46.163 --> 06:50.315
I did, but the crew... they asked
us to let them handle it.

06:50.333 --> 06:52.368
Yeah.

06:52.419 --> 06:53.986
She said she couldn't live
without me.

06:54.004 --> 06:57.122
And I just thought she was
being dramatic, you know?

06:57.156 --> 07:00.092
I never imagined...

07:02.295 --> 07:04.430
I shouldn't have left her alone.

07:04.464 --> 07:06.265
Look, this is a...

07:06.299 --> 07:08.300
Terrible situation

07:08.334 --> 07:11.503
and obviously something
we'd prefer to keep quiet.

07:11.521 --> 07:13.639
I know you guys
have a job to do,

07:13.673 --> 07:15.608
but if there's
any way you can,

07:15.642 --> 07:18.477
(sighs) limit who you tell.

07:19.980 --> 07:21.847
We're a growing company,

07:21.865 --> 07:25.117
but we're a young company,
and, uh,

07:25.151 --> 07:28.571
bad publicity is something
we just can't afford.

07:30.189 --> 07:33.659
Well, we will be
as, uh, discreet

07:33.693 --> 07:35.527
as we can be.

07:35.562 --> 07:37.496
But thank you
for coming forward.

07:39.282 --> 07:41.967
I want to see
the toxicology report.

07:42.002 --> 07:43.085
Mr. Britten!

07:44.804 --> 07:45.921
(Woman chuckles)

07:45.972 --> 07:47.205
- Kate?
- Yes!

07:47.224 --> 07:48.924
(Chuckles)
Hi. Hey.

07:48.975 --> 07:49.925
Hi.

07:49.976 --> 07:51.543
What are you doing here?

07:51.561 --> 07:53.012
I was here for the party

07:53.046 --> 07:54.763
until, you know.

07:54.798 --> 07:56.398
You work for the company?

07:56.433 --> 07:58.484
No, no. I live
in New York now.

07:58.518 --> 07:59.768
I'm an investment banker.

07:59.819 --> 08:01.386
We, uh, funded these guys.

08:01.404 --> 08:03.221
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow.

08:03.240 --> 08:06.525
I know. Long way from being
(Chuckles) Rex's babysitter, right?

08:09.195 --> 08:10.663
I'm so sorry.

08:10.697 --> 08:13.949
I... I was out of the country
when it happened.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.734
I meant to call. I just felt... sure.

08:15.752 --> 08:17.903
We hadn't seen each other
in so long, I felt weird.

08:17.921 --> 08:20.339
It's okay.

08:22.042 --> 08:24.260
Look, I don't suppose
you know how long

08:24.294 --> 08:25.344
they're going to keep us.

08:25.378 --> 08:27.353
I mean, I'd be happy to
help if I saw anything,

08:27.354 --> 08:28.464
but I wasn't even outside.

08:28.515 --> 08:30.766
I was coming out
of the bathroom when I heard.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.250
What happened there?

08:32.269 --> 08:35.804
Oh, that's actually
how I heard.

08:35.855 --> 08:38.724
Darin, one of the guys who
owns the company... yeah.

08:38.758 --> 08:39.642
He was totally freaked.

08:39.693 --> 08:41.121
He was running down the hallway,

08:41.121 --> 08:42.594
yelling that someone had jumped

08:42.611 --> 08:45.147
and slammed into me
and spilled his wine.

08:45.198 --> 08:48.320
I've had a long day.
I'd just love to go back to my hotel.

08:48.321 --> 08:49.101
Sure. Well,

08:49.119 --> 08:51.120
let me, uh, let me
ask a couple of questions,

08:51.154 --> 08:52.291
see what the situation is,

08:52.292 --> 08:55.440
and I promise I'll try and get you
out of here as soon as I can, okay?

08:55.458 --> 08:57.242
- (Laughs): All right, thank you.
- All right. (Laughs)

08:57.276 --> 08:58.494
Bye.

08:58.545 --> 09:00.079
Um, aren't you
gonna introduce me?

09:00.113 --> 09:01.997
- Absolutely not. Don't even turn around.
- But she looks...

09:02.048 --> 09:04.166
- She's a babysitter...
- Don't even turn your head.

09:09.806 --> 09:11.106
Bird:
Name's Charlie Simmons.

09:11.141 --> 09:13.425
He had quite a reputation

09:13.459 --> 09:16.545
as a professional partier...
Drugs, girls, full-time fun.

09:16.579 --> 09:18.314
Depends on your idea
of fun, I suppose.

09:18.348 --> 09:20.232
Can you give us
a minute, please.

09:20.266 --> 09:21.350
Neighbor said
he heard something

09:21.401 --> 09:22.801
that sounded like
a gunshot, but figured

09:22.819 --> 09:24.469
it was just another one
of Charlie's parties,

09:24.487 --> 09:25.738
so he didn't call it in.

09:25.772 --> 09:27.022
Housekeeper came in
this morning

09:27.073 --> 09:28.190
and found him as such.

09:28.224 --> 09:30.866
Look like he's been
pretty much executed.

09:30.867 --> 09:33.362
- Hey, check out the fingers. 
- Ooh.

09:33.413 --> 09:35.564
He's not gonna be playing
the ukulele in heaven.

09:35.598 --> 09:37.583
Bird: Charlie definitely
had a rough night.

09:37.617 --> 09:39.835
Come on. Let me
show you why.

09:42.539 --> 09:45.290
Bird:
So they tied him up,

09:45.324 --> 09:47.042
go after a couple of fingers,

09:47.093 --> 09:48.927
get the combination,
take whatever's in there out,

09:48.962 --> 09:50.546
and decide they
don't need a witness.

09:50.597 --> 09:52.831
- We have any idea what was in there?
- Nope.

09:52.849 --> 09:55.300
S.I.D.'s gonna get back to us.

09:55.334 --> 09:57.636
Well, it's behind a panel.
Maybe they knew it was here.

09:57.670 --> 09:58.837
So let's start
figuring out

09:58.872 --> 10:00.589
which of Charlie's friends
was close enough

10:00.623 --> 10:02.374
- to know he had a safe.
- Ooh.

10:02.409 --> 10:05.343
That's gonna take a while.
Charlie had a lot of friends.

10:08.531 --> 10:10.783
Hey, look at this.
See the handle on the safe?

10:10.817 --> 10:13.452
- It's all marked up.
- Yeah.

10:13.486 --> 10:16.321
I'm saying, before they got
the combination from Charlie,

10:16.355 --> 10:19.324
this idiot thought they
could hammer their way in.

10:19.358 --> 10:21.293
We're not looking for a genius.

10:21.327 --> 10:22.861
I can narrow it
down even more.

10:22.879 --> 10:24.529
Alarm company says
that Charlie

10:24.547 --> 10:26.331
set the alarm that night,
but it was shut off

10:26.365 --> 10:27.750
20 minutes before the murder

10:27.801 --> 10:29.868
by someone who entered
a guest code.

10:29.886 --> 10:32.370
So Charlie knew his killer?

10:32.389 --> 10:34.223
- Likely.
- All right.

10:34.257 --> 10:36.508
Let's find out how many
people had guest codes.

10:36.542 --> 10:38.644
I know of one so far.

10:39.679 --> 10:41.397
It was a shame.

10:41.431 --> 10:43.882
I mean, he could be
such a nice man...

10:43.900 --> 10:46.552
When he was himself.

10:46.586 --> 10:47.820
And when he
wasn't himself?

10:47.854 --> 10:49.071
Well, it was the drugs.

10:49.105 --> 10:51.523
They made him angry.

10:51.558 --> 10:53.558
Did he ever take
that out on you?

10:53.576 --> 10:56.361
No. Actually, the parties
worked out okay for me.

10:56.395 --> 10:57.746
Mr. Simmons would feel

10:57.781 --> 10:59.748
so guilty about the state
the house was in,

10:59.783 --> 11:02.167
he paid me extra
when I came to clean.

11:02.202 --> 11:04.036
Where were you
Saturday night?

11:04.070 --> 11:04.920
Playing bingo.

11:04.954 --> 11:07.172
Till what time?

11:07.207 --> 11:10.175
Like, around midnight.
I was with my niece.

11:10.210 --> 11:12.578
She won $200.

11:12.612 --> 11:13.779
Nice.

11:13.813 --> 11:15.431
We'll gonna need
to speak to her.

11:15.465 --> 11:17.099
Okay. Of course.

11:20.970 --> 11:24.807
This is the, uh, code
you use for the alarm

11:24.858 --> 11:26.024
to get into the house

11:26.059 --> 11:27.759
when you're cleaning it
for Mr. Simmons?

11:27.777 --> 11:28.877
Yes.

11:28.912 --> 11:30.529
Do you know who else
had access to it?

11:30.563 --> 11:32.865
His stepbrother, Mark.

11:32.899 --> 11:34.366
Now he would stay

11:34.400 --> 11:37.119
sometimes and watch the house
when Charlie was out of town,

11:37.153 --> 11:38.370
but, um,

11:38.404 --> 11:40.038
well, they haven't talked
in a long time,

11:40.073 --> 11:43.292
so I don't know if he
still had the code or not.

11:43.326 --> 11:44.960
Why not?
Why aren't they talking?

11:44.994 --> 11:48.446
Something to do
with Charlie's father dying,

11:48.465 --> 11:50.549
I think.

11:50.583 --> 11:52.084
Anybody else you can think of?

11:52.118 --> 11:54.253
Girlfriends, ex-girlfriends?

11:54.287 --> 11:56.421
Amber.

11:56.455 --> 11:57.723
Amber?

11:57.757 --> 11:59.624
They were not good together.

11:59.642 --> 12:01.626
Where would we find this Amber?

12:01.644 --> 12:03.962
She's some kind of actress.

12:03.980 --> 12:05.964
<i>Lives in Hollywood.</i>

12:05.982 --> 12:07.900
(Dogs barking)

12:07.934 --> 12:09.485
Here it is.

12:11.905 --> 12:13.071
(Knocking)

12:16.142 --> 12:18.026
Amber Blue?

12:22.015 --> 12:24.449
Kate?

12:24.483 --> 12:26.118
Kate?

12:26.152 --> 12:28.370
Uh, what do you want?

12:28.421 --> 12:30.706
We're with the LAPD.

12:30.757 --> 12:32.424
We need to ask you
some questions.

12:32.458 --> 12:34.293
What for?

12:34.327 --> 12:36.328
Kate... it's me.

12:36.346 --> 12:38.447
It's Michael Britten.

12:38.481 --> 12:42.718
You used to babysit
my son Rex.

12:48.231 --> 12:50.051
When did this happened?

12:50.528 --> 12:53.864
We found him yesterday.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.099
It wasn't an OD?

12:56.134 --> 12:58.735
No. He was murdered.

13:01.889 --> 13:03.924
What about you
and Mr. Simmons?

13:03.958 --> 13:06.426
How did you meet?

13:06.461 --> 13:08.261
We met at a party.

13:08.279 --> 13:11.448
Uh, he said he liked my work
in some film.

13:11.482 --> 13:14.100
It was a terrible film,

13:14.118 --> 13:15.819
but I think
he actually meant it.

13:15.870 --> 13:20.006
And, um, we started dating
or something.

13:20.041 --> 13:23.410
Or something?

13:23.444 --> 13:26.379
Guys like Charlie...
They're just sort of looking

13:26.414 --> 13:27.914
for younger girls
to have around.

13:27.948 --> 13:32.452
They take care of you,
buy you nice things.

13:32.470 --> 13:34.337
He let me move in.
(Clears throat)

13:34.388 --> 13:35.789
When was this?

13:35.807 --> 13:38.008
A little under a year.

13:38.059 --> 13:40.844
But he cut me loose
about a month ago.

13:40.895 --> 13:42.546
What happened?

13:42.580 --> 13:44.631
He went to rehab.

13:44.649 --> 13:48.968
He dropped out after a week,
but that was it.

13:48.986 --> 13:50.320
Not that I blame him.

13:50.354 --> 13:51.855
I mean, we were both a mess
by the end.

13:51.906 --> 13:54.724
All we did
was get high together.

13:54.759 --> 13:58.245
And what have you
been doing since?

13:58.279 --> 14:00.814
Well, I've been
looking for work.

14:00.832 --> 14:02.499
I signed
with a new agent,

14:02.533 --> 14:06.953
and he's got some things
lined up.

14:06.987 --> 14:10.040
Where were you
on Saturday night?

14:13.661 --> 14:15.929
Kate?

14:15.963 --> 14:18.598
Kate...

14:18.633 --> 14:23.336
Where were you
on Saturday night?

14:23.354 --> 14:25.572
Uh... in the ER.

14:28.192 --> 14:30.443
I passed out in a club.

14:30.478 --> 14:32.479
The cops didn't know
what to do with me,

14:32.513 --> 14:36.349
so they took me to the hospital.
Let me sleep it off.

14:36.367 --> 14:37.901
(Sighs)

14:37.935 --> 14:40.787
I have the discharge
papers if you want them.

14:40.822 --> 14:42.239
That would be great.

14:42.290 --> 14:43.356
- Sure.
- Okay.

14:43.374 --> 14:44.691
Hold on.

14:50.998 --> 14:54.417
What can you tell me about
Mr. Simmons' stepbrother Mark?

14:54.468 --> 14:59.256
Not much.
He's some, uh... Rocky wannabe.

14:59.307 --> 15:01.975
Always in training or something.

15:02.009 --> 15:04.227
They weren't speaking

15:04.262 --> 15:05.762
when Charlie and I
started hanging out.

15:05.813 --> 15:09.983
Uh, he came over once with
some papers Charlie had to sign.

15:10.017 --> 15:13.052
He didn't like me very much.

15:13.070 --> 15:14.404
Why is that?

15:19.059 --> 15:21.728
He thought I was part
of Charlie's problems.

15:23.000 --> 15:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:32.290 --> 15:33.840
Kate, what are you using?

15:35.626 --> 15:37.377
Nothing.

15:39.213 --> 15:41.581
Right now.

15:41.599 --> 15:43.133
I know a really
good program

15:43.184 --> 15:45.218
and I know the people there
pretty well.

15:45.252 --> 15:46.720
Why don't you let me help you

15:46.754 --> 15:48.805
get you in there.

15:48.856 --> 15:52.642
Believe it or not, I was doing
just fine 20 minutes ago

15:52.693 --> 15:54.361
when I'd forgotten
you existed.

15:54.395 --> 15:57.314
I don't need your help,
Mr. Britten.

15:57.365 --> 15:59.649
I just need you to leave.

15:59.700 --> 16:02.035
Lee:
<i>Seeing this woman Kate</i>

16:02.069 --> 16:05.121
in reality,
and then dreaming about her

16:05.156 --> 16:06.539
where her life has unraveled,

16:06.574 --> 16:08.959
what comes to mind?

16:11.162 --> 16:13.129
I don't know. Things...

16:13.164 --> 16:16.082
Well, things are, obviously,
they're different.

16:16.116 --> 16:17.751
You've created different
versions of everything

16:17.785 --> 16:21.287
in order to protect yourself
from the discovery

16:21.305 --> 16:23.957
that this is reality.

16:23.975 --> 16:26.626
The fact that this Kate
person shows up

16:26.644 --> 16:28.511
in the world
in which you see Rex

16:28.562 --> 16:29.846
proves that that's a dream.

16:29.897 --> 16:33.733
How?

16:33.768 --> 16:36.019
Would you have dreamt
of running into someone

16:36.053 --> 16:38.305
you haven't seen
for ten years,

16:38.339 --> 16:40.941
and then the very next day

16:40.975 --> 16:43.209
she just happens
to show up in reality?

16:43.244 --> 16:46.246
Isn't it far more reasonable
that you ran into her here

16:46.280 --> 16:49.349
in reality first,
on the boat,

16:49.383 --> 16:54.320
and then your mind carried her
over into your dream?

16:54.338 --> 16:58.408
Evans: <i>You said that Kate was
Charlie's girlfriend, right?</i>

16:58.442 --> 17:00.427
Yeah.

17:00.461 --> 17:03.346
<i>So I'm willing to bet that</i>
<i>there's something in the house,</i>

17:03.381 --> 17:07.165
<i>a-a picture, some mail,</i>
<i>something</i>

17:07.184 --> 17:12.305
<i>that you subconsciously noted</i>
<i>that drew Kate to your mind,</i>

17:12.339 --> 17:14.441
<i>and you called her to life</i>
<i>in your dream.</i>

17:14.474 --> 17:17.844
Lee: <i>That picture isn't real.
You went back</i>

17:17.862 --> 17:19.512
and placed it
in your dream

17:19.530 --> 17:23.182
to try to continue to spin
endlessly on the question

17:23.200 --> 17:25.452
of where Kate appeared
first.

17:27.872 --> 17:29.739
Every time
the answers become clear,

17:29.790 --> 17:33.176
you try to find ways
to cover them up.

17:33.210 --> 17:35.795
Evans: I think what's more
relevant to the question

17:35.830 --> 17:37.196
of which Kate is real,

17:37.214 --> 17:40.533
is why you're seeing her
in one world

17:40.551 --> 17:42.952
and reflecting her
so differently in the other.

17:42.987 --> 17:45.271
I don't know.

17:45.306 --> 17:47.257
It's not like she's...

17:47.308 --> 17:48.892
Well, either of them aren't

17:48.926 --> 17:51.978
particularly central
to either case.

17:52.013 --> 17:53.179
Well, is it possible

17:53.213 --> 17:56.382
that these diverging Kates
have less to do

17:56.400 --> 18:00.620
with the cases you're working
on, and more to do with Rex?

18:00.654 --> 18:01.988
Rex?

18:02.023 --> 18:03.273
Yeah, think about it.

18:03.324 --> 18:06.860
Kate was someone
who used to take care of Rex.

18:06.894 --> 18:09.896
Maybe her appearance
in both worlds

18:09.930 --> 18:12.082
is telling you something
about the difficulty

18:12.116 --> 18:14.667
you're having
connecting with Rex.

18:19.073 --> 18:21.291
Guess who I ran into yesterday.

18:21.342 --> 18:23.777
- Who?
- Kate.

18:23.811 --> 18:26.846
- Babysitter Kate?
- Yeah.

18:26.881 --> 18:29.049
She was, like,
the Rex whisperer.

18:29.083 --> 18:30.383
He loved her.

18:30.417 --> 18:31.968
He did, didn't he?

18:32.019 --> 18:36.306
If Rex had a tantrum
or he was moody,

18:36.357 --> 18:38.892
she would make
this amazing paper airplane.

18:38.926 --> 18:41.478
It could, like, stay in the air
for five minutes.

18:41.529 --> 18:42.812
Rex would stand there

18:42.863 --> 18:45.532
and watch it make
these wide, lazy loops,

18:45.566 --> 18:49.119
and forget anything
that was bothering him.

18:51.105 --> 18:54.240
I'm pretty sure
I put one in his scrapbook.

18:57.962 --> 18:59.462
Where did you run
into Kate?

18:59.497 --> 19:00.997
I took her statement.

19:01.048 --> 19:04.667
She was, she was at a party
where something happened.

19:04.718 --> 19:07.453
I always wondered
what happened to Kate.

19:07.471 --> 19:09.139
I think she did good.

19:09.173 --> 19:12.008
She's some big cheese investment
banker in New York now.

19:12.042 --> 19:13.459
Good for her.

19:13.477 --> 19:15.011
Yeah.

19:15.062 --> 19:19.232
I'd heard she struggled
with loss of her sister.

19:19.266 --> 19:20.250
Her sister died?

19:20.284 --> 19:21.301
Yeah.

19:21.335 --> 19:22.802
I told you that
when it happened.

19:22.820 --> 19:25.405
It was awful.
It was some

19:25.439 --> 19:27.690
freak surfing accident
in Mexico.

19:27.741 --> 19:31.644
Wow. I completely forgot.

19:31.662 --> 19:33.780
Yeah, she went through
a really rough time.

19:33.814 --> 19:37.584
Huh. Something must have
really turned her around.

19:44.091 --> 19:45.475
<i>She's like the Rex whisperer.</i>

19:45.509 --> 19:49.328
<i>She would make</i>
<i>this amazing paper airplane.</i>

19:49.346 --> 19:51.764
It could, like, stay in the air
for five minutes.

19:55.436 --> 19:58.555
<i>I'm pretty sure</i>
<i>i put one in his scrapbook.</i>

20:14.071 --> 20:15.155
What are you doing?

20:15.189 --> 20:16.573
You don't remember this?

20:16.624 --> 20:18.908
These little planes...
You used to make 'em with Kate.

20:18.959 --> 20:20.426
Found it in
the scrapbook.

20:20.461 --> 20:21.694
Kate?

20:21.712 --> 20:25.031
Your babysitter Kate.
You remember her?

20:25.049 --> 20:27.917
Kind of. Not really.

20:27.968 --> 20:29.836
I was, like, five.

20:34.308 --> 20:36.809
I talked to Cole's
parents last night.

20:36.844 --> 20:38.211
They called you?

20:38.229 --> 20:40.096
No, I called them.

20:40.147 --> 20:41.314
It's been two days,

20:41.348 --> 20:42.682
and you haven't
apologized to Cole.

20:42.716 --> 20:44.067
I will.

20:44.101 --> 20:45.318
When?

20:45.352 --> 20:46.569
Soon.

20:46.604 --> 20:48.071
Soon isn't
good enough.

20:48.105 --> 20:49.722
Dad, I have a Spanish test
first period,

20:49.740 --> 20:51.724
and you've been telling me
to get my grade up.

20:51.742 --> 20:53.326
Can we not do this now?

20:58.165 --> 20:59.749
(Door closes)

21:04.495 --> 21:05.695
Charlie and I we're never been close.

21:05.940 --> 21:09.359
But we did okay until his dad
Ben died, my stepdad.

21:11.401 --> 21:15.487
Ben and I...
We just clicked.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.375
He and my mother... they got
divorced about five years ago

21:19.409 --> 21:22.628
so it wasn't like
he had to hang out with me.

21:22.662 --> 21:24.380
We just got close.

21:24.414 --> 21:26.582
And what happened after he died?

21:26.616 --> 21:28.950
I've been trying
to get into UFC fighting,

21:28.969 --> 21:31.286
for a few years,
and Ben's been staking me.

21:31.304 --> 21:33.455
He was paying for my trainers,
giving me an allowance

21:33.473 --> 21:35.557
to live on so I could focus
on the fighting.

21:35.592 --> 21:39.461
But when he died,
Charlie got everything.

21:39.479 --> 21:41.814
He just couldn't wait
to cut me off.

21:41.848 --> 21:43.515
You two have words
about that?

21:43.566 --> 21:44.817
I went down to him,

21:44.851 --> 21:47.102
I said, "look, this is
what Ben and I were into."

21:47.136 --> 21:48.737
Maybe you and I
get something going."

21:48.772 --> 21:50.572
He laughed at me.

21:50.607 --> 21:53.158
I figured, all right,
it's his call.

21:53.193 --> 21:55.394
When I started seeing
where all Ben's money

21:55.428 --> 21:58.313
was going, to the big parties
with the hookers

21:58.331 --> 22:00.115
and the drugs...

22:00.149 --> 22:01.617
Meanwhile, I'm struggling
to get a job

22:01.651 --> 22:03.118
so I can stay in my apartment.

22:03.152 --> 22:05.120
So I sued him.

22:05.154 --> 22:06.288
How did that go?

22:08.324 --> 22:10.325
Got dropped.

22:10.343 --> 22:12.211
I had a decent attorney
file the papers,

22:12.262 --> 22:15.214
but I couldn't afford him
after that, and...

22:15.265 --> 22:17.349
After a while,
I just gave up and moved on.

22:17.384 --> 22:18.851
When was all this?

22:18.885 --> 22:20.168
Maybe two months ago.

22:20.186 --> 22:22.304
Saturday night...
Where were you?

22:22.338 --> 22:23.472
I was here training.

22:23.506 --> 22:25.941
I had a match
early the next morning. Why?

22:25.975 --> 22:27.443
Can anybody confirm
that you were here?

22:31.138 --> 22:34.223
No. I was here
training by myself.

22:34.258 --> 22:35.341
All right, thanks.

22:35.392 --> 22:37.093
That was the D.A.

22:37.127 --> 22:38.460
Just went through
the father's will.

22:38.479 --> 22:39.962
Victim was next in line.

22:39.980 --> 22:41.764
In the event that
anything happened to him,

22:41.798 --> 22:43.099
guess where the assets go.

22:43.133 --> 22:44.984
To Mr. MMA himself, Mark Hudson.

22:45.018 --> 22:46.652
Exactly. So he kills
his stepbrother,

22:46.687 --> 22:48.938
tries to make it look like
an amateur robbery,

22:48.972 --> 22:52.241
hence the hammer marks on the
safe handle, and he's all set.

22:52.276 --> 22:53.359
We go search his place?

22:53.410 --> 22:54.810
He's got a brain in his head,

22:54.828 --> 22:56.612
then he's gotten rid
of the gun by now.

22:56.646 --> 22:58.764
If we find a fingerprint
or a fiber at the house,

22:58.799 --> 23:00.283
he'll say it's from
a previous visit.

23:00.317 --> 23:01.951
So how do we put him

23:01.985 --> 23:03.836
in Charlie's house
on Saturday night?

23:03.871 --> 23:06.655
The old-fashioned way:
We go play detective.

23:08.725 --> 23:10.343
♪

23:29.863 --> 23:31.680
So how's it
going with Rex?

23:31.698 --> 23:34.350
I don't know.
I can't get a word out of him.

23:34.368 --> 23:36.536
Can't even get an opening.

23:36.570 --> 23:37.870
Don't you find
that ironic?

23:37.905 --> 23:39.155
I mean, here
you are,

23:39.189 --> 23:41.791
this big-time detective,
you can get killers to turn,

23:41.825 --> 23:44.160
but you can't get two words
from your own kid?

23:46.496 --> 23:48.447
Man:
<i>What is it</i> ?

23:48.482 --> 23:50.383
We're with the LAPD.

23:50.417 --> 23:52.501
We'd like to ask you some
questions about an incident

23:52.535 --> 23:53.636
at your neighbor's,
Charlie Simmons.

23:53.670 --> 23:54.820
I already told the officers

23:54.855 --> 23:56.705
I didn't hear
or see anything unusual.

23:56.723 --> 23:59.375
Uh, we're following up
on information

23:59.393 --> 24:00.977
about a particular individual

24:01.011 --> 24:02.845
and a vehicle
that we think may have been

24:02.879 --> 24:04.013
in the neighborhood that night.

24:04.047 --> 24:06.082
If we could have a couple
of minutes, please, sir.

24:06.116 --> 24:07.650
Hold the pictures
up for the camera.

24:07.684 --> 24:09.885
I can tell you in two seconds.

24:09.903 --> 24:12.021
There you go.

24:12.055 --> 24:13.940
Nope. Sorry.

24:13.991 --> 24:15.524
Didn't see either.

24:15.558 --> 24:17.360
Is that it?

24:20.414 --> 24:23.749
Think that thing can see
the street from here?

24:23.784 --> 24:25.734
Yeah.

24:25.752 --> 24:28.554
Sir, is your camera linked to
any kind of recording device?

24:28.589 --> 24:30.506
Yeah. Why?

24:30.540 --> 24:32.258
Open up please
or we'll get a warrant.

24:32.292 --> 24:34.377
Your security system
just became evidence

24:34.411 --> 24:37.380
in a murder investigation.

24:47.808 --> 24:49.609
Hey, sleepyhead.

24:49.643 --> 24:51.093
Hey.

24:51.111 --> 24:54.930
I was gonna let you sleep in,
but Efram's on the phone.

24:54.948 --> 24:57.450
He said you'd want me
to wake you up.

24:57.484 --> 24:58.951
Thanks.

24:58.986 --> 25:00.786
I'm making French toast.

25:00.821 --> 25:03.572
Hey. What's up?

25:03.606 --> 25:06.742
Banks called. Said he got the
blood work back on our jumper.

25:06.776 --> 25:08.210
Thought we could
meet over there.

25:08.245 --> 25:09.378
All right.

25:09.413 --> 25:11.113
I'll call you
when I'm on my way.

25:11.131 --> 25:12.048
All right.

25:13.333 --> 25:15.635
Banks:
We found a pretty large amount

25:15.669 --> 25:17.286
of a benzodiazepine
in her blood,

25:17.321 --> 25:18.921
along with
the alcohol.

25:18.955 --> 25:20.556
Probably something
like alprazolam.

25:20.590 --> 25:22.425
Medical records show
she had a prescription.

25:22.459 --> 25:25.928
So Cameron tells her
the affair is off.

25:25.962 --> 25:27.229
Because?

25:27.264 --> 25:30.632
Because he realized he's
engaged to a lingerie model.

25:30.651 --> 25:32.801
She gets drunk, eats
a bottle of her pills

25:32.819 --> 25:34.636
and jumps in the ocean.

25:34.655 --> 25:36.055
Sounds pretty
suicidal to me.

25:36.089 --> 25:37.606
Banks: Yeah, well, with everything

25:37.641 --> 25:39.659
floating through her system,
my guess is she would've been

25:39.693 --> 25:41.327
sluggish enough to drown
in a kiddie pool.

25:41.361 --> 25:44.096
So, we're calling it?

25:44.131 --> 25:46.982
We recovered her phone, right?

25:47.000 --> 25:48.317
It was in her purse?

25:48.335 --> 25:50.770
Yeah. We went through it,
but nothing jumped out.

25:50.804 --> 25:52.755
Let's go through it again.

25:52.789 --> 25:54.090
Why?

25:54.124 --> 25:56.175
Because something
should've jumped out.

25:56.209 --> 25:57.927
Great. Thanks.

25:57.961 --> 25:59.762
I-I'll call you
if I have any more questions.

25:59.796 --> 26:01.931
No, no, you were very helpful.

26:01.965 --> 26:04.166
So that was the last
of Annie Yang's

26:04.184 --> 26:06.168
five most contacted friends
according to her phone records,

26:06.186 --> 26:07.970
and not one of them
had any indication

26:08.004 --> 26:10.056
from her she was having
an affair with Cameron Fuller.

26:10.107 --> 26:12.308
Well, having an affair
with your boss

26:12.342 --> 26:14.193
isn't exactly
something you advertise.

26:14.227 --> 26:16.362
I mean, it's supposed
to be kept a secret.

26:16.396 --> 26:18.180
Yeah, well, apparently she kept
it a secret from herself,

26:18.198 --> 26:19.949
'cause I've read
all the texts to Fuller,

26:19.983 --> 26:22.518
all the texts from Fuller;
There's nothing other than

26:22.536 --> 26:24.620
completely professional
communication.

26:24.654 --> 26:25.854
Maybe she erased the juicy ones.

26:25.872 --> 26:27.490
Everyone knows texting
is how you get caught.

26:27.524 --> 26:28.274
Everyone?

26:28.308 --> 26:29.792
Everyone my age.

26:31.712 --> 26:32.995
Why would Fuller make it up?

26:33.029 --> 26:34.213
When you see the papers,

26:34.247 --> 26:36.549
his fiancée's dumping him
over the affair.

26:36.583 --> 26:39.085
Lie to the cops
and ruin his life?

26:39.136 --> 26:42.171
Maybe to give us a reason
why she might have jumped

26:42.205 --> 26:44.507
and stop us looking for a reason
why she might have been pushed.

26:44.541 --> 26:47.893
There's a totally obvious reason
why she would have jumped

26:47.928 --> 26:50.646
and no evidence that she didn't,
but you're not ready

26:50.680 --> 26:53.682
to make
the call.

26:53.716 --> 26:55.935
All right, well, if you're so
sure it's an open-and-shut case,

26:55.986 --> 26:58.554
why don't you stay here and
erase some of your juicy texts?

26:58.572 --> 27:00.556
Where are you going?

27:00.574 --> 27:02.158
I'm going
to Annie Yang's apartment.

27:04.044 --> 27:05.978
Britten:
Vega.

27:06.012 --> 27:07.780
- Vega: Yo.
- Anything?

27:07.814 --> 27:09.898
There are some pictures
of Annie and Fuller.

27:09.916 --> 27:11.500
Together?

27:11.535 --> 27:13.953
No, just some group shots
from work.

27:14.004 --> 27:15.671
Uh-huh.

27:15.705 --> 27:17.540
Anything else... e-mails?

27:17.574 --> 27:19.208
They all look
professional,

27:19.242 --> 27:21.577
but for all we kw they could have
set up dummy e-mail accounts

27:21.595 --> 27:23.512
or deleted everything
as soon as they got it.

27:23.547 --> 27:24.913
Sure.

27:24.931 --> 27:25.803
I'm telling you,

27:25.804 --> 27:29.018
I've seen people do some serious
stuff to hide an affair.

27:30.187 --> 27:32.021
Look,

27:32.055 --> 27:33.722
you're the senior detective
and I'm the rookie,

27:33.756 --> 27:35.257
but we've been here
for hours

27:35.275 --> 27:37.259
and we've torn
this place apart.

27:37.277 --> 27:39.779
Not only do we not
have anything,

27:39.813 --> 27:41.981
we don't even know
what we're looking for.

27:42.032 --> 27:44.100
So don't take this
the wrong way,

27:44.134 --> 27:46.101
but how much longer
do we do this?

27:46.119 --> 27:47.820
(Sighs)

27:55.278 --> 27:57.746
Just give me a minute.

27:57.780 --> 27:59.781
Where are you going?

28:08.958 --> 28:10.059
What are you looking for?

28:10.093 --> 28:12.211
I have no idea.

28:33.416 --> 28:35.367
Men's shaving cream.

28:35.418 --> 28:36.368
Well, there's your evidence

28:36.419 --> 28:38.420
she was sleeping
with someone.

28:38.455 --> 28:40.589
(Can rattles)

28:51.101 --> 28:53.552
(Sighs)

28:53.603 --> 28:55.604
A safety deposit key.

28:56.973 --> 28:58.691
All right.

28:58.725 --> 28:59.942
Let's get
another warrant.

29:12.796 --> 29:14.264
Hmm.

29:14.998 --> 29:16.131
What is it?

29:16.165 --> 29:18.601
It's some kind
of research document.

29:18.635 --> 29:21.437
The real question is,
why does a personal assistant

29:21.471 --> 29:23.305
have company documents
in a safety deposit box,

29:23.339 --> 29:26.174
and why does
she feel the need

29:26.193 --> 29:29.144
to hide the key
in a can of shaving cream?

29:29.178 --> 29:31.280
I don't know,

29:31.314 --> 29:32.865
but I'd still
like to know

29:32.899 --> 29:35.017
what made you look
under that sink.

29:37.737 --> 29:40.573
When you've been doing the job
as long as I have,

29:40.624 --> 29:42.741
sometimes you just have
to follow your instincts.

29:42.792 --> 29:44.960
All right, let's get
this stuff to Len,

29:44.995 --> 29:47.213
see if he can make
head or tail of it.

29:48.231 --> 29:50.198
All right, thanks.

29:50.217 --> 29:52.835
He says they're materials
research papers.

29:52.869 --> 29:54.970
Why would she
tuck them away?

29:55.005 --> 29:56.722
Apparently the company found
some way to manufacture

29:56.756 --> 29:59.675
silicon chips at a fraction
of the normal cost,

29:59.709 --> 30:01.427
and all the funds they've
raised over the past year

30:01.478 --> 30:02.595
were to get this
off the ground.

30:02.646 --> 30:05.380
These papers show
it wasn't working.

30:05.398 --> 30:06.682
So I'm guessing
she confronted

30:06.716 --> 30:09.384
her boss... lover... Fuller...
And asked him

30:09.402 --> 30:11.020
why he was hiding this
from the investors,

30:11.054 --> 30:12.905
and suddenly he's got a reason
to toss her overboard

30:12.939 --> 30:15.057
or make it look
like she jumped.

30:15.075 --> 30:17.059
Except Fuller was
in front of 20 people

30:17.077 --> 30:19.394
on the deck of the boat
when she went over, so...

30:19.412 --> 30:21.063
Well, the research papers
weren't just bad for him.

30:21.081 --> 30:22.748
They were bad
for the whole company.

30:22.782 --> 30:23.749
Okay.

30:23.783 --> 30:26.401
So he had help.

30:26.419 --> 30:29.405
Do you recognize that woman?

30:29.439 --> 30:31.457
She's one of
our bankers...

30:31.508 --> 30:32.808
Kate something.

30:32.842 --> 30:33.742
Kate Porter?

30:33.760 --> 30:34.927
Right.

30:34.961 --> 30:37.896
She says that seconds
after Ms. Yang went overboard,

30:37.931 --> 30:39.348
you bumped into her
in the corridor,

30:39.382 --> 30:40.516
spilled a drink
on her dress.

30:40.550 --> 30:41.967
That ring a bell?

30:42.018 --> 30:42.968
I-I don't know.

30:43.019 --> 30:44.570
I mean, I-I remember yelling,

30:44.604 --> 30:45.921
someone had jumped.

30:45.939 --> 30:47.523
I was panicked.

30:47.557 --> 30:49.224
Do you remember
what the drink was?

30:49.258 --> 30:51.644
No, I-I honestly don't.

30:51.695 --> 30:54.747
Because we had the,
the stain tested.

30:54.781 --> 30:57.199
It was red wine.

30:57.233 --> 30:59.668
With traces of a benzodiazepine

30:59.703 --> 31:02.204
called alprazolam.

31:02.238 --> 31:04.106
Britten: Which is exactly what
the toxicology report said

31:04.124 --> 31:05.324
was found
in Ms. Yang's system

31:05.375 --> 31:08.160
when they fished her
out of the water.

31:08.194 --> 31:09.244
Even if you could
prove my client

31:09.278 --> 31:11.497
was carrying
that drink, so what?

31:11.548 --> 31:12.831
He could have picked
it up anywhere.

31:12.882 --> 31:15.050
Even if you could prove
he gave it to her,

31:15.085 --> 31:16.919
he could have been
trying to calm her down.

31:16.953 --> 31:18.420
Right, that sounds likely.

31:18.454 --> 31:20.589
Doesn't it?

31:20.623 --> 31:22.791
I got your partner
in the other room,

31:22.809 --> 31:25.293
and he knows what you did
up in that stateroom.

31:25.312 --> 31:28.764
Well, he was part of making up
the whole story with you

31:28.798 --> 31:30.149
and, uh, putting on

31:30.183 --> 31:31.767
that wonderful performance
on the night.

31:31.801 --> 31:33.602
If you think

31:33.636 --> 31:35.237
that he's going
to keep quiet,

31:35.271 --> 31:37.940
take the rap
rather than save himself,

31:37.974 --> 31:39.108
then you keep hiding behind

31:39.142 --> 31:40.242
this slick-talking
young man here,

31:40.276 --> 31:41.527
but if you want
to trade the truth

31:41.578 --> 31:43.145
for any kind of leniency...

31:44.831 --> 31:46.799
Darin,

31:46.833 --> 31:49.451
now is your time.

31:53.907 --> 31:55.524
Here's what I can do.

31:55.558 --> 31:58.761
I can tell the D.A.
you cooperated.

31:58.795 --> 32:01.196
That could change your life.

32:01.231 --> 32:03.298
But it's up to you.

32:03.332 --> 32:05.300
You help us close
this case,

32:05.334 --> 32:08.721
tell the truth,
tell us what we need to hear,

32:08.772 --> 32:13.058
and maybe you might end up
in a minimum security facility.

32:21.034 --> 32:22.484
I liked her.

32:22.519 --> 32:23.969
I did.

32:24.003 --> 32:25.904
She was with me from the start.

32:25.955 --> 32:28.290
She believed in me.

32:28.324 --> 32:31.660
When she found out
about the research results,

32:31.694 --> 32:34.063
she just said
we should come forward.

32:34.097 --> 32:36.382
She wasn't threatening anyone.

32:36.416 --> 32:39.101
I told Darin, and he...

32:41.137 --> 32:42.581
Look, you have to understand,

32:42.582 --> 32:44.723
he's been my partner
since college, okay?

32:44.758 --> 32:45.924
I just had some ideas.

32:45.975 --> 32:48.177
He turned them into a business.

32:48.211 --> 32:49.511
Settled all the problems.

32:49.545 --> 32:50.846
Like Annie?

32:50.880 --> 32:52.214
Yeah.

32:53.382 --> 32:55.434
He talked to her
the morning of the boat party,

32:55.485 --> 32:56.685
and he offered her money,

32:56.719 --> 32:58.620
but she wouldn't
take it.

32:58.655 --> 33:00.439
So...

33:00.490 --> 33:04.726
He came up
with the boat idea and...

33:04.744 --> 33:06.728
And the affair story.

33:06.746 --> 33:09.798
Who came up
with the drugs?

33:09.833 --> 33:12.201
He did.

33:12.235 --> 33:13.886
And then who gave them to her?

33:13.920 --> 33:15.337
- You?
- No.

33:15.371 --> 33:18.924
No, I...

33:18.958 --> 33:20.592
Darin.

33:20.627 --> 33:22.044
(Sniffles)

33:42.782 --> 33:44.783
We combed the security footage
on the block

33:44.818 --> 33:48.403
for the six hours
before and after the murder.

33:48.437 --> 33:50.122
- Mark Hudson's truck?
- Yeah?

33:50.156 --> 33:51.439
Never showed up.

33:51.458 --> 33:53.942
But I did find a car
that I thought

33:53.960 --> 33:56.328
just didn't look right
in the neighborhood.

33:58.381 --> 34:00.282
Well, people who live
in these big homes,

34:00.300 --> 34:01.583
they hire a lot of help.

34:01.617 --> 34:03.451
Except the timing in and
out of the neighborhood

34:03.470 --> 34:04.753
matches the murder exactly.

34:04.787 --> 34:06.421
Did we run the plate?

34:06.455 --> 34:09.975
Yeah, belongs to a
Katherine Porter.

34:12.344 --> 34:14.346
Kate.

34:19.405 --> 34:21.505
I told you, I was in the ER.

34:21.522 --> 34:22.973
Until 9:00.

34:23.007 --> 34:25.275
Charlie Simmons was murdered
two hours later.

34:25.309 --> 34:26.943
Well, I went home after that.

34:26.978 --> 34:28.228
I can't believe you think...

34:28.262 --> 34:29.545
Mr. Britten,

34:29.580 --> 34:31.181
tell him that I
didn't do this, please.

34:31.215 --> 34:32.449
You're telling me
you didn't go

34:32.483 --> 34:33.599
to Charlie's house
that night?

34:33.618 --> 34:35.467
- No.
- You're sure about that?

34:35.503 --> 34:37.454
I think I know where I was.

34:37.487 --> 34:39.121
Okay.

34:39.156 --> 34:41.206
Then help me
out here.

34:42.243 --> 34:45.844
'Cause that must be your
car driving itself.

34:50.434 --> 34:52.252
Please, Mr. Britten.

34:52.286 --> 34:54.638
I used to take care of Rex.

34:54.672 --> 34:57.424
You know me.

34:57.458 --> 34:59.459
I do know you.

34:59.477 --> 35:01.294
And that's why...

35:01.312 --> 35:04.898
I don't want you to make this any
harder on yourself than it already is.

35:04.932 --> 35:06.966
Hey, if you
tell the truth,

35:06.984 --> 35:09.419
I promise you
I will do whatever I can

35:09.453 --> 35:11.688
to help you.

35:13.591 --> 35:15.358
Okay?

35:15.409 --> 35:17.310
Kate?

35:22.616 --> 35:25.001
It wasn't supposed
to happen like this.

35:25.036 --> 35:27.170
Liam was just going to...

35:27.204 --> 35:29.039
He was just supposed
to take the money.

35:29.090 --> 35:30.707
Who's Liam?

35:30.758 --> 35:32.092
(Sighs)
Liam Tell.

35:32.126 --> 35:34.594
He's some guy I know
who knows some other guys.

35:34.628 --> 35:36.179
What kind of guys?

35:36.213 --> 35:37.663
Is he a dealer?

35:40.801 --> 35:43.219
I was broke,
and I hadn't had a hit

35:43.270 --> 35:46.189
in like a week, and I...

35:46.223 --> 35:47.673
I thought I was
losing my mind,

35:47.692 --> 35:50.343
and I knew that Charlie kept
a lot of cash in his house,

35:50.361 --> 35:53.947
so I gave... I gave Liam
the alarm code.

35:53.981 --> 35:55.648
But I swear,
he said he was just

35:55.682 --> 35:59.903
going to go in
and scare Charlie...

35:59.954 --> 36:02.822
And get him
to open the safe.

36:02.856 --> 36:06.309
This wasn't supposed to happen.

36:09.530 --> 36:12.132
I'm so sorry.

36:14.969 --> 36:16.753
(Camera shutter snapping)

36:18.472 --> 36:20.840
You said that Kate
lost her sister, yes?

36:20.874 --> 36:22.258
This way.

36:22.309 --> 36:23.676
Britten:
<i>Yeah.</i>

36:23.710 --> 36:26.679
<i>She drowned.</i>

36:26.713 --> 36:29.599
Lee:
<i>And from that one loss,</i>

36:29.650 --> 36:31.384
<i>you've imagined her life going</i>

36:31.402 --> 36:33.686
<i>in two very different</i>
<i>directions.</i>

36:33.720 --> 36:36.189
Thank you.

36:36.223 --> 36:38.441
What do you make of that?

36:39.860 --> 36:41.261
It's like everything else.

36:41.295 --> 36:45.382
Things are different, but...

36:45.416 --> 36:48.001
Equally plausible.

36:48.035 --> 36:49.953
So, if you find it
just as realistic

36:50.004 --> 36:54.557
that a tragedy can strengthen
someone or destroy them,

36:54.592 --> 36:57.610
what I'm wondering
is what you think

36:57.645 --> 37:00.713
makes it go in one direction
or the other.

37:03.417 --> 37:05.351
Britten:
How did it come to this?

37:05.386 --> 37:07.187
I don't know.

37:09.223 --> 37:13.359
For a long time, I couldn't stop
thinking about that day.

37:13.394 --> 37:15.562
There was a big
storm, big waves.

37:15.596 --> 37:18.281
We both grabbed our boards
and rushed to get into it.

37:18.315 --> 37:20.950
Uh... (Sighs)

37:20.985 --> 37:22.535
But when we got there...

37:22.570 --> 37:26.772
My sister got nervous and said
that maybe we should sit it out.

37:28.409 --> 37:30.827
But I talked her into it.

37:32.613 --> 37:34.214
The waves were horrible.

37:34.248 --> 37:35.615
The riptides were vicious.

37:35.633 --> 37:39.169
We both... fell.

37:39.220 --> 37:42.305
We lost track
of each other and...

37:43.624 --> 37:45.892
That was it.

37:47.628 --> 37:49.562
And for a long time,
I was so angry

37:49.597 --> 37:51.181
at myself and at the world.

37:51.232 --> 37:53.516
I didn't see the point
in anything.

37:53.567 --> 37:54.984
(Sighs)

37:55.019 --> 37:57.237
And it's not like people
didn't want to help.

37:57.271 --> 37:59.272
It's just that when a thing
like that happens,

37:59.306 --> 38:01.741
you don't know
how to let them.

38:04.161 --> 38:05.578
<i>I skipped work.</i>

38:05.613 --> 38:07.146
I didn't talk
to my friends.

38:07.164 --> 38:09.532
My mom kept trying to
get me back out there,

38:09.583 --> 38:12.001
telling me
it would make me feel better.

38:12.036 --> 38:14.120
But I kept telling her
that that was the point.

38:14.154 --> 38:15.955
I didn't want
to feel any better.

38:18.659 --> 38:20.844
Eventually, she just let me be.

38:25.633 --> 38:28.384
<i>After that,</i>
<i>I started finding my own ways</i>

38:28.435 --> 38:30.803
<i>to deal with the pain.</i>

38:32.423 --> 38:34.858
She just wouldn't
let me be.

38:34.892 --> 38:38.695
I don't know how my mom did it.

38:38.729 --> 38:43.449
I mean, she was just as sad
and hurt as I was.

38:43.484 --> 38:45.818
Somehow she had
the strength

38:45.852 --> 38:48.187
to not only stay on her feet,

38:48.205 --> 38:52.125
but to get me
back on mine.

38:52.159 --> 38:54.210
And she must have tried
a thousand times

38:54.245 --> 38:57.864
to get me back into my life,
and I just kept saying no.

38:57.898 --> 39:00.667
I guess I'm lucky

39:00.701 --> 39:04.003
that she was willing
to try a thousand and one.

39:21.338 --> 39:24.941
We have to talk
about what happened.

39:24.975 --> 39:26.743
Again?

39:26.777 --> 39:29.579
Well, you haven't really
told me anything.

39:29.613 --> 39:31.014
Not really.

39:31.048 --> 39:32.898
Cole broke my racquet.

39:32.917 --> 39:34.900
I got mad.

39:34.919 --> 39:36.869
End of story.

39:36.903 --> 39:39.239
He broke a couple of strings.

39:39.273 --> 39:40.790
Come on.

39:40.841 --> 39:42.575
Why would you go after him
like that?

39:42.593 --> 39:43.927
He's your best friend.

39:44.979 --> 39:46.663
Forget it.

39:46.697 --> 39:48.414
Doesn't matter.

39:48.432 --> 39:50.450
It does matter.

39:52.269 --> 39:53.920
It matters to me.

39:59.777 --> 40:02.261
Look.

40:02.279 --> 40:04.881
Hey.

40:04.915 --> 40:07.233
I know you're going
through a lot.

40:07.267 --> 40:08.901
I know it isn't
easy for you.

40:08.936 --> 40:10.603
I get that.

40:10.621 --> 40:12.322
Now, I don't expect
you to tell me

40:12.373 --> 40:14.907
every little thing that's
going through your head,

40:14.941 --> 40:16.726
but you have
to talk to me

40:16.760 --> 40:18.077
because I'm all
you've got.

40:18.111 --> 40:20.380
And I'm not going anywhere.

40:20.414 --> 40:22.382
I'm right here.

40:22.416 --> 40:25.451
I'm your father, and I love you.

40:28.339 --> 40:30.523
Cole shouldn't have used
my racquet.

40:30.557 --> 40:32.392
He says
he'll fix it.

40:32.426 --> 40:33.926
- He can't fix it.
- Why not?

40:33.960 --> 40:35.961
Because it was mom's.

40:39.817 --> 40:42.652
I never used it; I just...

40:44.905 --> 40:47.607
I liked to keep it in my bag.

40:49.810 --> 40:53.646
Made me feel... like something.

40:58.852 --> 41:00.403
Now it's gone.

41:00.437 --> 41:01.754
Well, he didn't know.

41:01.789 --> 41:03.089
I know.

41:03.123 --> 41:04.407
I know that.

41:04.441 --> 41:06.092
He wants to be nice.

41:06.126 --> 41:08.361
Everybody wants to be nice.

41:10.997 --> 41:12.482
But I can't help it, okay?

41:12.516 --> 41:15.268
I think about mom...

41:15.302 --> 41:18.521
And I just get angry
all over again.

41:21.975 --> 41:23.976
Well...

41:24.010 --> 41:27.179
You know, it's okay to be angry.

41:27.197 --> 41:30.216
I get pretty angry, too,
sometimes.

41:36.974 --> 41:39.542
