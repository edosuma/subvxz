00:06.840 --> 00:09.743
[theme music]

01:13.006 --> 01:16.444
More coffee, honey?

01:16.477 --> 01:18.446
Hey, take my word for it.

01:18.479 --> 01:21.949
By midnight tonight, the taxes
will be filed, and all of this

01:21.982 --> 01:27.621
will be behind us-- the
tension, the anxiety, the fraud.

01:27.655 --> 01:29.690
Stupid system run
by stupid people,

01:29.723 --> 01:32.360
thought up by stupid people,
hired by stupid people.

01:32.393 --> 01:35.896
Who are elected by
even stupider people.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.031
Why can't everybody just
pay a flat percentage?

01:38.065 --> 01:40.334
You know, that's a great idea.

01:40.368 --> 01:43.070
Maybe this year, instead of,
you know, filing, you ought

01:43.103 --> 01:45.239
to go change the tax laws.

01:45.273 --> 01:46.540
It makes more sense than this.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.709
This stuff's so complicated,
nobody can understand it.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.478
Well, maybe we
could have found

01:50.511 --> 01:52.246
somebody to explain
it to us if you didn't

01:52.280 --> 01:53.447
wait till the last minute.

01:53.481 --> 01:54.482
Don't, don't.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.550
Don't start laying
this off on me.

01:56.584 --> 01:58.352
I'm not saying nothing.

01:58.386 --> 02:00.854
Of course, it is on
you, because you did go

02:00.888 --> 02:02.190
and wait till the last minute.

02:02.223 --> 02:04.525
You know, if you wanted to
get the texas done earlier,

02:04.558 --> 02:06.994
you could have started getting
stuff together yourself.

02:07.027 --> 02:08.429
Well, I'm so glad
that you brought

02:08.462 --> 02:12.132
that up, honey, because I did.

02:12.166 --> 02:15.569
I got all my W-2s
and all my receipts.

02:15.603 --> 02:19.507
They're all added up,
catalogued, put together,

02:19.540 --> 02:22.410
and ready to go.

02:22.443 --> 02:24.312
No kidding?

02:24.345 --> 02:25.145
You're all done?

02:32.886 --> 02:36.357
No, I just wanted to
see the look on your face.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.892
You know, I thought I'd
try to keep it light,

02:38.926 --> 02:41.395
you know, you know.

02:41.429 --> 02:43.096
So this is how you're
trying to be helpful?

02:43.130 --> 02:44.398
By telling jokes?

02:44.432 --> 02:46.800
No, just till midnight.

02:46.834 --> 02:51.572
I will tell one showstopper at
11:59, and then I shall rest.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.474
You know, if you think
this is so much fun,

02:53.507 --> 02:55.976
you ought to sit down here
and try to figure these taxes.

02:56.009 --> 02:56.810
Fine, no problem.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.515
- You want to do the taxes?
- You want me to?

03:01.549 --> 03:02.516
Oh, do the taxes.

03:02.550 --> 03:03.484
I'd be happy to.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.554
Please do the taxes.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.656
Why, allow me.

03:08.689 --> 03:09.490
OK.

03:16.464 --> 03:17.498
What's the matter, Rosanne?

03:17.531 --> 03:18.332
Nothing.

03:22.102 --> 03:23.804
So what?

03:23.837 --> 03:26.940
You're at line 12.

03:26.974 --> 03:30.010
Business income.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.346
We just tell them it's
none of their business.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.981
[fake laughter]

03:35.683 --> 03:38.319
You know, this
is really one time

03:38.352 --> 03:40.721
where I think being a woman is
really going to come in handy.

03:40.754 --> 03:41.889
You know?

03:41.922 --> 03:44.958
Because you know, us
women read and comprehend

03:44.992 --> 03:49.129
instructions so much better
than you men, as you know.

03:49.162 --> 03:53.033
So that is what I'll be
doing right now, huh?

03:53.066 --> 03:57.971
I'll be looking and reading
the instructions for line 12.

04:11.652 --> 04:16.924
Line 10, line 11,
line 13 and 14.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.727
There is no line 12.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.630
Why isn't there any line 12?

04:22.663 --> 04:25.766
I'll check the back for line 12.

04:25.799 --> 04:26.667
Let's see.

04:26.700 --> 04:27.568
Ah!

04:27.601 --> 04:29.903
Schedule C, aha!

04:29.937 --> 04:31.672
Now, we're in the
money, schedule

04:31.705 --> 04:38.779
C, E, F, E, E. Schedule C. See?

04:38.812 --> 04:40.414
Schedule C.

04:40.448 --> 04:41.615
See this.

04:41.649 --> 04:45.052
15 hours and counting, Einstein.

04:45.085 --> 04:49.723
If line 67 is $500 or more,
and more than 10% of the tax

04:49.757 --> 04:52.326
shown on your return, or
you under-paid your 1989

04:52.360 --> 04:55.396
estimated tax liability
for any payment period,

04:55.429 --> 04:57.230
you may owe a penalty.

04:57.264 --> 04:59.700
Right.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.201
So OK, I give up.

05:01.234 --> 05:03.904
What language is this?

05:03.937 --> 05:06.607
Fiduciary Esperanto.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.208
Well, they couldn't
go put something

05:08.241 --> 05:10.878
in here that, like, nobody
on earth could understand.

05:10.911 --> 05:11.812
They wouldn't do that!

05:11.845 --> 05:13.547
They wouldn't do that.

05:13.581 --> 05:14.782
OK.

05:14.815 --> 05:15.916
OK.

05:15.949 --> 05:18.486
If line 67 is $500 or
more, and more than--

05:18.519 --> 05:20.754
oh, oh, oh.

05:20.788 --> 05:30.197
If line 67 is $500 or more,
and more than 10% of the tax--

05:30.230 --> 05:36.370
oh, then your husband must
by law complete the taxes.

05:45.913 --> 05:47.915
Hey, Becky.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.583
How much money do you think
Mom and Dad last year?

05:49.617 --> 05:50.784
I don't know.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.820
You know, I once heard
Mom saying to Aunt Jackie

05:52.853 --> 05:54.988
that this house
cost them 30,000,

05:55.022 --> 05:56.356
and they bought this
house years ago.

05:56.390 --> 05:57.991
So if they could afford
to spend that much,

05:58.025 --> 06:00.761
then they're probably making
three times that much now.

06:00.794 --> 06:03.531
(LOUDLY) $90,000?

06:03.564 --> 06:04.798
Oh, my god!

06:04.832 --> 06:05.633
Way off.

06:09.069 --> 06:12.506
Way, way off.

06:12.540 --> 06:15.509
So how much did you make?

06:15.543 --> 06:18.045
Way off.

06:18.078 --> 06:20.113
Mom, how much money did
you guys make last year?

06:20.147 --> 06:21.381
Dad doesn't want to tell us.

06:21.415 --> 06:23.216
That's because he don't know.

06:23.250 --> 06:25.419
Besides, it's not polite
to go asking people

06:25.453 --> 06:27.220
how much money they make.

06:27.254 --> 06:28.856
Even if it's your own parents?

06:28.889 --> 06:31.158
Especially if it's
your own parents.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.561
I mean, just generally, how
much does someone with a job

06:33.594 --> 06:34.462
make?

06:34.495 --> 06:35.796
Well, it depends on the job.

06:35.829 --> 06:40.200
Say, she worked, shampooing
heads and gossiping all day.

06:40.233 --> 06:43.270
Well, then, she would probably
be paid very, very well,

06:43.303 --> 06:46.974
but you know, mostly, in the
form of cash tips, which she

06:47.007 --> 06:48.408
would, of course,
pocket, and then

06:48.442 --> 06:51.011
not tell anybody about
that, including her husband

06:51.044 --> 06:54.014
and three wonderful children.

06:54.047 --> 06:56.216
So in other words, you're
not going to tell us either.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.986
Now, look, your dad and I made
enough money last year to live

06:59.019 --> 07:04.224
very, very well for six months.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.994
And then, we juggled.

07:07.027 --> 07:09.396
What do you mean, you juggled?

07:09.429 --> 07:10.631
OK.

07:10.664 --> 07:13.166
You know how when you
borrow a quarter from Becky,

07:13.200 --> 07:14.568
and you can't pay
her back so then

07:14.602 --> 07:16.169
you come borrow $1
from me, and then

07:16.203 --> 07:19.306
I go and deduct it from
your next week's allowance?

07:19.339 --> 07:21.709
Yeah, and then the next week,
when my allowance is only $4,

07:21.742 --> 07:23.010
I can't get into the movies.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.311
Right.

07:24.344 --> 07:25.913
So then, you just go in and
swipe $1 out of my purse.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.515
You know, like you always do.

07:27.548 --> 07:31.151
You mean, you
guys steal money?

07:31.184 --> 07:32.686
No, no.

07:32.720 --> 07:33.987
We don't need to steal money.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.322
We have credit.
Go to school.

07:35.355 --> 07:36.389
Yeah.

07:36.423 --> 07:37.725
What do you think
we're paying taxes for?

07:37.758 --> 07:39.827
Do you guys cheat
on your income tax?

07:39.860 --> 07:40.661
Absolutely not.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.639
On his speech about moving
to an island in the Pacific

07:51.672 --> 07:53.707
and never paying taxes again

07:53.741 --> 07:54.608
yet.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.343
Well, so far so good.

07:56.376 --> 07:57.310
So far.

07:57.344 --> 07:58.512
Except for the yakking.

07:58.546 --> 08:01.849
I have been dreading
this for weeks.

08:01.882 --> 08:04.151
You know how crummy my math is.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.485
Well, no sweat.

08:05.519 --> 08:08.889
DJ will be home by 3:00.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.057
Pretty funny, Roseanne.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.760
I think I can manage
to do my own taxes,

08:12.793 --> 08:14.862
despite what certain
men might think.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.467
Hey, you just said yourself
that you're no good with math.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.535
I know.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.170
I'm self-conscious as
it is about my math.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.806
I don't need to be hearing
about it from my boyfriend.

08:25.839 --> 08:30.177
He tells me that he loves me,
and then he criticizes my math.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.079
So maybe he should look
over my form, you know,

08:32.112 --> 08:33.914
like I can't handle it.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.016
Do you mind?

08:36.049 --> 08:36.917
Come on, Sis.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.051
Let's go in the living room.

08:38.085 --> 08:40.821
He's taking over the
main ballroom here.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.790
The adding machine stays.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.091
Oh, just these two
numbers together.

08:44.124 --> 08:51.364
Look, what's 14,173.80
plus 1,319.16, roughly?

08:51.398 --> 08:53.066
Thanks, great.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.668
You just messed me all up here.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.604
Well, sorry, but
it's just real quick.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.772
14,173-- OK.
- Do it.

08:58.806 --> 09:00.207
- No--
- (YELLING) Do it!

09:00.240 --> 09:01.041
OK.

09:08.749 --> 09:09.850
Well, that's not right.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.085
That can't be right.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.053
Oh, let me.

09:13.086 --> 09:13.887
OK.

09:16.624 --> 09:23.731
On the top-- 14,173.80,
plus the 13--

09:23.764 --> 09:27.000
thanks, Dan.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.135
Good.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.102
Yeah.

09:29.136 --> 09:30.203
Now, see, that's
closer to the total.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.008
OK, OK, OK.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.878
What's going on
between you and Gary?

09:37.911 --> 09:40.781
Oh, nothing.

09:40.814 --> 09:43.383
Oh, yes, there is, and
you're dying to tell me.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.552
- Nothing's going on.
- Spill it.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.955
He thinks he's so smart and
I can't handle anything that

09:47.988 --> 09:50.457
requires a little simple math.

09:50.490 --> 09:52.760
Well, I told you not to
do any math in front of him

09:52.793 --> 09:55.495
till after you're married.

09:55.528 --> 09:56.764
Roseanne?

09:56.797 --> 09:59.399
I need your 1099 for that
magazine subscription job.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.768
I didn't get one!

10:00.801 --> 10:02.135
What do you mean,
you didn't get one?

10:02.169 --> 10:05.272
I mean, l did not get one,
as opposed to, I did get one.

10:05.305 --> 10:08.075
You know, therefore I do
not have one, as opposed to,

10:08.108 --> 10:09.843
I have one.

10:09.877 --> 10:11.111
You didn't get a 1099?

10:11.144 --> 10:13.513
See, now, there's some
communication happening.

10:13.546 --> 10:14.447
Roseanne!

10:14.481 --> 10:16.483
No, I didn't
get a 1099, honey.

10:16.516 --> 10:18.485
But I didn't need
one, because you've

10:18.518 --> 10:20.353
got to make something
like $600 or something

10:20.387 --> 10:21.655
like that to even
get one, you know?

10:21.689 --> 10:22.555
That's the rule.

10:22.589 --> 10:23.691
Says who?

10:23.724 --> 10:24.624
Says god!

10:24.658 --> 10:25.625
I don't know.

10:25.659 --> 10:28.161
It's against the rules.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.329
You know this for a fact?

10:29.362 --> 10:30.197
Yeah!

10:30.230 --> 10:31.531
- You asked someone?
- Yes.

10:31.564 --> 10:32.432
Who?

10:32.465 --> 10:33.266
Jackie.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.605
Jackie's wrong.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.407
Everybody gets a 1099.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.843
DJ didn't get one,
so not everybody.

10:42.876 --> 10:43.811
Oh, come on, Roseanne.

10:43.844 --> 10:44.878
This is a joke.

10:44.912 --> 10:47.080
I need that 1099, or we're dead.

10:47.114 --> 10:49.149
I didn't get any kind of
1099, because I'm not supposed

10:49.182 --> 10:51.218
to get any kind of 1099.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.721
But here's what I'm
going to do for you.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.789
I'm calling up
the IRS right now,

10:55.823 --> 10:58.391
and I'm going to ask them just
to make absolutely positively

10:58.425 --> 11:00.460
sure that I don't need no 1099.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.095
Oh, Roseanne, get real.

11:02.129 --> 11:03.230
It's tax day.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.332
You're never going to
get through to the IRS.

11:05.365 --> 11:06.233
Great.

11:06.266 --> 11:07.534
What are we going to do?

11:07.567 --> 11:08.802
Well, I don't know.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.871
We'll just go ahead and do
everything else, you know,

11:10.904 --> 11:14.341
and then we'll worry about
the 1099 thing later.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.508
What, later?

11:15.542 --> 11:16.343
Later, when?

11:19.079 --> 11:19.980
OK, OK.

11:20.013 --> 11:20.881
Yeah.

11:20.914 --> 11:23.116
We are, kind of, all out later.

11:23.150 --> 11:27.420
But I mean, it's no big deal.

11:27.454 --> 11:28.555
OK?

11:28.588 --> 11:31.091
They didn't mail me any
kind of 1099, so how can

11:31.124 --> 11:31.925
we declare the income?

11:36.363 --> 11:41.368
It's not our fault. I'm done.

11:41.401 --> 11:42.269
Hey.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.137
Hey!

11:44.171 --> 11:46.406
You're messing with the feds.

11:46.439 --> 11:47.607
Hey!

11:47.640 --> 11:50.744
You're the one who told
me when we was in the car

11:50.778 --> 11:52.379
coming back from shopping--

11:52.412 --> 11:55.582
you're the one that says
I shouldn't get one.

11:55.615 --> 11:59.052
Oh, I thought you were
talking about a wig.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.855
You are really, really
getting on my nerves today, man!

12:01.889 --> 12:04.424
I mean, more than usual!
- OK.

12:04.457 --> 12:07.094
What if she is
supposed to get a 1099,

12:07.127 --> 12:08.728
and it got lost in the mail?

12:08.762 --> 12:10.831
And then, the IRS is
going to check her on it,

12:10.864 --> 12:13.500
and you guys are going
to have to have an audit?

12:13.533 --> 12:15.735
[ominous music]

12:17.204 --> 12:19.139
And they don't go back
for one year, you know.

12:19.172 --> 12:22.375
They can go back, like,
six years to audit.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.677
[ominous music]

12:26.113 --> 12:29.182
And if you can't document
every single solitary deduction

12:29.216 --> 12:32.252
for the last six years,
you've got to pay!

12:32.285 --> 12:34.121
And not only the adjusted
tax, but the penalties

12:34.154 --> 12:35.455
and the interest.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.791
And in order to make sure
that you pay, they can freeze

12:37.825 --> 12:40.127
your bank account, they
can garnish your wages,

12:40.160 --> 12:42.362
they can auction
off your furniture!

12:42.395 --> 12:45.032
They'd auction our furniture?

12:45.065 --> 12:48.535
Let's not file, for sure!

12:48.568 --> 12:49.602
Come on, Roseanne.

12:49.636 --> 12:50.770
What are we going to
do about this 1099?

12:50.804 --> 12:52.940
I ain't in no mood for an audit!

12:52.973 --> 12:55.608
[ominous music]

12:57.110 --> 13:01.114
I think we should
get out of this house!

13:01.148 --> 13:04.151
Let's just go down to the
IRS and ask them in person.

13:04.184 --> 13:05.886
No, no, I can't.
No way, no way.

13:05.919 --> 13:06.686
I can't go down
to that building.

13:06.719 --> 13:07.720
It gives me the creeps.

13:07.754 --> 13:09.489
I just know I'm
going to take one

13:09.522 --> 13:11.224
of those snotty little
IRS guys and throw

13:11.258 --> 13:12.960
them through a window.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.395
Well, that would not be
smart, honey, because then we

13:15.428 --> 13:16.696
would definitely get an audit.

13:33.580 --> 13:36.116
Please remain behind
the yellow line, sir.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.484
Hey, look, doll-face.

13:37.517 --> 13:41.955
I got Form 4255 here, entitled,
"Recapture of investment

13:41.989 --> 13:45.058
credits, for disposal or changed
use of investment properties

13:45.092 --> 13:47.027
before the end of
their useful life."

13:47.060 --> 13:51.264
Is there anything sharp
I could stick in my eye?

13:51.298 --> 13:54.001
Do I include Form
8611 for reduction

13:54.034 --> 13:57.670
in quality basis of property
and put the total in line 50,

13:57.704 --> 14:00.640
or do I list them separately?

14:00.673 --> 14:03.743
I'll get the supervisor.

14:03.776 --> 14:05.512
I think the wise
thing would be to go

14:05.545 --> 14:07.547
down to your local IRS office.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.019
Should have been on
vacation in Florida.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.554
Please, step behind
the yellow line.

14:14.587 --> 14:18.691
Sorry, it's not like we're
going to hit you or nothing.

14:18.725 --> 14:19.826
- What do you need?
- OK.

14:19.859 --> 14:23.830
How much you gotta earn
to be mailed a 1099?

14:23.863 --> 14:24.764
1099.

14:24.797 --> 14:27.567
Um, that's income from gambling?

14:27.600 --> 14:28.801
No.

14:28.835 --> 14:30.170
No, it isn't.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.471
Pension income?

14:31.504 --> 14:33.740
[makes buzzer noise]

14:34.741 --> 14:35.976
Times up, Denise.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.644
I'm sure this instruction
book will help, OK?

14:37.677 --> 14:38.811
Uh-huh.

14:38.845 --> 14:40.880
Well, I've read this
book, and it is fabulous.

14:40.914 --> 14:42.282
But I would like
some information.

14:42.315 --> 14:45.518
See, I'd wager that's why they
call this the information line.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.988
I'm sorry, sir, but I've
only been here for two weeks.

14:48.021 --> 14:50.390
Well, so have we.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.459
Look, please, we've
been extremely busy.

14:52.492 --> 14:53.760
This is our busiest
day of the year.

14:53.793 --> 14:55.162
I'm sure you can understand.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.030
I mean, I've been here
since 7:30 this morning,

14:57.064 --> 14:58.298
I never got lunch,
and they don't even

14:58.331 --> 14:59.799
have fresh coffee back here.

14:59.832 --> 15:02.902
Maybe one of your
colleagues can help us.

15:02.936 --> 15:04.204
Ed!

15:04.237 --> 15:06.806
Do you know anything
about a 1099?

15:06.839 --> 15:10.277
1099-r-- pensions and annuity.

15:10.310 --> 15:13.346
No, Ed.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.382
1099 income.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.916
Income, Ed.

15:16.950 --> 15:19.987
Counter 4.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.788
Is there anyone else?

15:21.821 --> 15:23.023
Anyone?

15:23.056 --> 15:24.557
I'll get the supervisor.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.893
Why, next year,
we're starting in June.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.161
Next year, we
ain't gonna file.

15:28.195 --> 15:29.462
Then we'll go to prison.

15:29.496 --> 15:33.033
Of course, I bet you don't
have to file for prison.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.901
What's the problem?

15:34.934 --> 15:37.170
Well, nobody in
your whole operation

15:37.204 --> 15:39.572
here seems to know
how much I have

15:39.606 --> 15:41.708
to earn to get mailed a 1099.

15:41.741 --> 15:42.675
What were your earnings?

15:42.709 --> 15:43.943
$400.

15:43.977 --> 15:45.812
An employer's only
required to send you a 1099

15:45.845 --> 15:47.880
if you earn $600 or more.

15:47.914 --> 15:48.781
$600?

15:48.815 --> 15:50.350
Really?

15:50.383 --> 15:52.052
You guys should have that
written down somewhere.

15:52.085 --> 15:52.986
We do.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.254
We have detailed
instruction books

15:54.287 --> 15:56.123
which can be easily understood
by people with at least

15:56.156 --> 15:57.924
an eighth-grade education.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.327
But of course, we have to
rely on co-operative citizens

16:00.360 --> 16:03.330
such as yourselves taking
the time to read them.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.632
No, see, I did read
this book, and there's

16:05.665 --> 16:07.100
nothing in here about no 1099.

16:07.134 --> 16:14.474
You show me where it says
anything in there about a 1099.

16:14.507 --> 16:17.210
Well, that's the
one page I skipped.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.282
That's on page 34.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.317
Page 34.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.186
Yeah, so it's our fault.

16:26.219 --> 16:27.720
I'm not saying it's
anyone's fault, ma'am,

16:27.754 --> 16:29.356
but the answer is
there in writing.

16:29.389 --> 16:30.523
Sorry there are no pictures.

16:33.526 --> 16:35.395
You're really funny, you know.

16:35.428 --> 16:38.565
You should have a cover
charge to get in this joint.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.133
You know, if more
people would take the time

16:40.167 --> 16:41.834
to read these
simple instructions,

16:41.868 --> 16:44.471
they wouldn't have to come down
here and ask stupid questions.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.274
And then, maybe these
lines wouldn't be so long.

16:47.307 --> 16:48.741
So long.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.143
Hey, hey.

16:50.177 --> 16:52.079
Hey, listen, you
pencil-pushing geek.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.485
I really didn't come down
here to stand in line

16:58.518 --> 17:01.054
all day to put up with
your condescending, snotty

17:01.088 --> 17:02.789
little attitude.
You know?

17:02.822 --> 17:04.424
I mean, I'm sure it
is a pain in your butt

17:04.457 --> 17:06.226
to answer our unimportant
little questions,

17:06.259 --> 17:08.428
but that is your job, isn't it?

17:08.461 --> 17:10.063
And you are paid
with our tax money.

17:10.097 --> 17:11.264
CROWD: Yeah, there you go!

17:11.298 --> 17:12.165
OK, honey.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.133
Come on.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.334
ROSEANNE: No, Dan.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.069
This stuff is impossible
to understand-- these laws

17:16.103 --> 17:17.304
and explanations of laws.

17:17.337 --> 17:19.005
No human being can really
understand these things,

17:19.038 --> 17:20.006
you know.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.541
That's why you've
got to go get some

17:21.574 --> 17:23.776
$200-an-hour lawyer to even
explain the crap to you,

17:23.810 --> 17:24.677
you know.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.279
And I can't afford $200 an hour.

17:26.313 --> 17:28.315
[crowd agreeing]

17:28.348 --> 17:30.217
(YELLING) We don't
write the stinking laws!

17:30.250 --> 17:31.184
You got a complaint?

17:31.218 --> 17:32.885
Talk to the idiots
in Washington!

17:32.919 --> 17:33.720
Ed!

17:40.760 --> 17:43.062
Well, maybe I should.

17:43.096 --> 17:44.131
I mean, us people--

17:44.164 --> 17:46.399
the poor people and
us regular people--

17:46.433 --> 17:48.535
we're paying more taxes
than the rich people

17:48.568 --> 17:50.570
because they got all the lawyers
to figure out the loopholes.

17:50.603 --> 17:51.838
I want to find loopholes.

17:54.974 --> 17:56.243
I mean, we give you
our money, and then

17:56.276 --> 17:57.777
you, like, totally
mismanage it worse

17:57.810 --> 17:59.446
than we ever could anyhow.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.881
I mean, the government is
something like $3 trillion

18:01.914 --> 18:02.949
in debt.

18:02.982 --> 18:05.152
I mean, I think I saw
that on "Donahue."

18:05.185 --> 18:07.687
It's like 3 trillion-- that'd
be like, if you're making

18:07.720 --> 18:09.156
$50,000 a year--

18:09.189 --> 18:12.024
OK, so you run up your master
charge to, like, 50 grand--

18:12.058 --> 18:13.960
they can't even imagine
your monthly bill.

18:13.993 --> 18:17.029
It'd be like $5,000 a month!

18:17.063 --> 18:18.398
I mean, it's insane!

18:18.431 --> 18:19.766
The whole thing is insane!

18:19.799 --> 18:22.935
I mean, some day, us regular
people-- we have to get smart,

18:22.969 --> 18:24.571
you know, and audit them!

18:24.604 --> 18:27.240
[crowd agreeing]

18:27.274 --> 18:28.941
I'm sorry, ma'am.

18:28.975 --> 18:32.645
I didn't get your name.

18:32.679 --> 18:33.680
You don't need our name.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.185
No, Dan.

18:38.218 --> 18:43.756
I'm not going to be intimidated
by that little weasel.

18:43.790 --> 18:47.427
Honey, this isn't the
unemployment office.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.928
(LAUGHING) No, no.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.663
I have nothing to hide.

18:50.697 --> 18:51.631
Excuse me, rabbi.

18:55.968 --> 19:00.207
I am not afraid to
tell you my name.

19:00.240 --> 19:03.075
It's Wagner.

19:03.109 --> 19:05.978
[crowd applauding]

19:11.518 --> 19:12.485
[whispering]

19:12.519 --> 19:15.455
Mrs. Norris T. Wagner.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.357
Come, Norris.
- Yes, dear.

19:25.332 --> 19:29.536
Presenting, new for 1989,
your income tax return!

19:29.569 --> 19:31.738
Pages and pages of
fabulous print on her own

19:31.771 --> 19:35.408
high-quality bond, brought
to you by the United

19:35.442 --> 19:37.076
States government--

19:37.109 --> 19:41.348
your pen, a Bic click,
retailing for $0.98,

19:41.381 --> 19:44.351
available to the bottom of any
of one of Mom's pocketbooks.

19:47.254 --> 19:48.054
Thank you, Vanna.

19:50.590 --> 19:51.358
And now--

19:53.693 --> 19:54.561
Wagner.

19:54.594 --> 19:57.230
Yes!

19:57.264 --> 19:58.598
All right, jackets!

19:58.631 --> 19:59.499
So did you guys cheat?

19:59.532 --> 20:00.433
Yeah.

20:00.467 --> 20:01.901
Rich people rip
up the government.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.403
Why should we?

20:03.436 --> 20:05.071
Oh, where'd you get that?

20:05.104 --> 20:08.140
Awful one of
your Dylan albums.

20:08.174 --> 20:09.041
Nobody cheated.

20:09.075 --> 20:10.176
Get in the car.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.578
Hope you guys
don't get an audit.

20:28.928 --> 20:31.298
[ominous music]

20:36.403 --> 20:37.270
Hi.

20:37.304 --> 20:38.371
I'm John Goodman.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.806
Thank you.

20:39.839 --> 20:43.743
What you've just seen was a
play, a silly little play,

20:43.776 --> 20:46.279
chock full of
jokes, just for fun,

20:46.313 --> 20:47.980
just for your entertainment.

20:48.014 --> 20:50.317
I personally have nothing
but the utmost respect for

20:50.350 --> 20:53.085
the Internal Revenue Service.

20:53.119 --> 20:56.723
Because you know, it's the
great guys and gals at the IRS

20:56.756 --> 20:59.326
who keep America rolling.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.127
See, it's like this.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.430
I got a contract with
a production company,

21:03.463 --> 21:06.299
and they hire writers who
put words in my mouth.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.835
For example, early
in the show, I go--

21:08.868 --> 21:11.738
it was my job to say,
it's a stupid system

21:11.771 --> 21:12.805
run by stupid people.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.273
Right, like, I believe that!

21:14.307 --> 21:16.108
As a matter of fact,
I don't believe

21:16.142 --> 21:17.877
anything I said on the show.

21:17.910 --> 21:21.614
It was my job as an actor.

21:21.648 --> 21:23.716
So I beg you, please
do not confuse

21:23.750 --> 21:26.486
hardworking, responsible,
tax-paying John

21:26.519 --> 21:31.123
Goodman with that lovable but
naughty scamp, Dan Conner.

21:31.157 --> 21:34.327
So to the men and women at
the IRS, my hat's off to you.

21:34.361 --> 21:35.227
Good night.

21:35.261 --> 21:36.896
God bless.
