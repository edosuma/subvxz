01:11.354 --> 01:13.478
Come on, Cameron.

01:36.913 --> 01:39.981
- Is it Dad?
- No.

01:42.152 --> 01:44.385
Come on. Let's cook.

01:44.921 --> 01:46.988
What are we eating?

01:47.624 --> 01:49.513
Spaghetti?

01:49.793 --> 01:51.448
Or...

01:51.528 --> 01:53.395
spaghetti?

01:55.465 --> 01:57.954
Come on. Help me make the sauce.

02:24.827 --> 02:28.184
<i>Lindsey, what are you doing?
Answer the phone.</i>

02:28.264 --> 02:31.354
<i>You can't ignore me, alright?
He's my kid too. I have...</i>

02:31.434 --> 02:34.674
<i>Alright, look. I'm sorry, okay? Just...</i>

02:34.754 --> 02:36.983
<i>just let me talk to him.</i>

02:37.063 --> 02:39.917
<i>I didn't mean to hit him, okay?
It was an accident, alright?</i>

02:39.997 --> 02:43.094
I would never intentionally
hurt him like that. You know that.

02:43.174 --> 02:47.181
<i>Okay? And I've apologized.
What the hell do you want from me?</i>

02:55.258 --> 02:57.047
Honey?

02:57.127 --> 02:59.782
- Everything okay in there?
- One second, Mom.

03:07.504 --> 03:09.331
You okay?

03:40.136 --> 03:41.870
Mom?

05:33.467 --> 05:34.816
Mom!

05:42.759 --> 05:44.881
What? What?

05:44.961 --> 05:46.462
No!

05:54.838 --> 05:56.632
Cameron?

06:38.915 --> 06:41.471
Oh. Could be important.

06:41.551 --> 06:44.707
- More important than right now?
- No.

06:47.457 --> 06:49.846
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

06:49.926 --> 06:52.458
You could have answered your damn phone.

06:52.538 --> 06:54.784
It's time to go, Henry.

06:55.364 --> 06:57.787
- How do you know my name?
- You want me to call security?

06:57.867 --> 07:01.358
No. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Who are you? What's this about?

07:01.438 --> 07:04.479
Look at your watch. What's it say?

07:04.559 --> 07:08.865
- 1:46.
- It's been 1:46 since you came in here.

07:08.945 --> 07:10.833
My watch froze. So what?

07:10.913 --> 07:14.537
I guarantee you every watch and clock
in this place says the exact same thing.

07:14.617 --> 07:19.637
Alright, crazy guy. Security!
Time for you to go.

07:21.123 --> 07:23.257
You know what this is?

07:25.161 --> 07:29.287
It's something important to you.
It's to help you remember who you really are.

07:30.967 --> 07:33.623
My brother gave me this
when I became partner.

07:33.703 --> 07:36.159
That's right. You're a lawyer, Henry.
You work all the time.

07:36.239 --> 07:38.061
You have no social life. You don't go out.

07:38.141 --> 07:42.610
And to be painfully honest, women
don't even look in your general direction.

07:43.146 --> 07:47.303
We're not in a nightclub.
You're not surrounded by beautiful women.

07:47.383 --> 07:49.538
Wake up, buddy.

07:49.619 --> 07:51.852
We're in your head.

07:53.589 --> 07:55.856
It's time for you to go.

07:56.459 --> 07:58.714
That's rude.

07:58.794 --> 08:00.379
Whoa!

08:08.705 --> 08:11.528
You gave them the power, Henry.
You can take it back.

08:11.608 --> 08:14.223
He's just messing with you, babe.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.491
That all you got?

08:18.781 --> 08:20.537
- Looking for Maggie?
- Where is she?

08:20.617 --> 08:23.740
She says she's so very sorry
about your little boy.

08:23.820 --> 08:26.209
- Fuck you!
- Get him out of here.

08:26.289 --> 08:29.646
- Better luck next time.
- Look out the window, Henry.

08:37.232 --> 08:38.520
Something wrong, Henry?

08:38.601 --> 08:41.285
- Come on.
- Oh...

08:48.578 --> 08:52.312
- Don't look at them. Keep moving.
- I'm losing my mind. Losing my mind.

09:02.425 --> 09:03.914
- Shit.
- What? What?

09:03.994 --> 09:07.250
Come on, did you really think I was
gonna make it that easy for you?

09:07.330 --> 09:09.252
- What's your favorite color?
- I don't have a favorite.

09:09.332 --> 09:12.013
What color's your car? Your best suit?
Favorite sweater? Come on!

09:12.093 --> 09:13.873
- What?
- I need to make an escape route,

09:13.953 --> 09:17.226
- something true. Answer the question.
- Green.

09:17.765 --> 09:20.741
- Where the fuck did that come from?
- Come on!

09:23.046 --> 09:26.236
- What the hell is this?
- This is where we break down the illusion.

09:26.316 --> 09:29.817
If you want to wake up from this, jump.

09:34.290 --> 09:37.079
- Henry, open the door!
- Fuck that.

09:37.159 --> 09:39.666
Open the door! Henry, let me in!

09:39.746 --> 09:42.285
But, baby... But your eyes are black.

09:42.365 --> 09:44.521
Baby, he slipped something into your drink.

09:44.601 --> 09:48.457
Henry! Jump, now.
You won't get another chance.

09:48.537 --> 09:51.494
- You can't make me do this.
- I can't make you do anything, Henry.

09:51.574 --> 09:54.497
- You have to believe it will work.
- Open the door! Let me in!

09:54.577 --> 09:57.233
Come on. Open the door! Let me in!

09:57.313 --> 10:00.069
- You go first.
- If that would help, I would.

10:00.149 --> 10:02.538
But you have to make the choice.

10:04.186 --> 10:06.453
Come with me, Henry.

10:27.576 --> 10:29.867
No!

10:31.147 --> 10:33.716
No!

11:25.568 --> 11:28.958
Alright. Rise and shine, boss.

11:29.038 --> 11:32.195
You did it. Another one bites the dust, huh?

11:32.275 --> 11:35.898
Welcome back to reality.
How many fingers am I holding up?

11:35.978 --> 11:39.835
Oliver, get your damn thumb out of my face.

11:39.915 --> 11:42.116
Alright. You'll live.

11:43.485 --> 11:45.809
Maggie wasn't there.

11:46.589 --> 11:49.846
After 15 dives, we've lost her.

11:49.926 --> 11:53.449
I know. But we'll get her.
She can't hide forever.

11:53.529 --> 11:55.930
She's taunting me, Oliver.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.566
It's a game to her.

12:03.673 --> 12:05.428
You.

12:05.708 --> 12:08.242
You were in my dream.

12:19.254 --> 12:21.294
Wasn't a fucking dream.

12:59.228 --> 13:02.196
This is gonna be the end of you.
You know that, right?

13:04.400 --> 13:08.647
- We'll lower the dosage next time.
- Can't lower the dosage.

13:09.739 --> 13:12.127
The problem is you, boss.

13:12.207 --> 13:15.632
Come on. Look what the bouncer
did to your wrist.

13:15.712 --> 13:18.701
Look, you're adapting.
It's becoming too real.

13:18.781 --> 13:22.606
I'm telling you, if you don't watch it,
you're gonna get stuck in there.

13:24.156 --> 13:26.532
You're not going soft on me, are you, Oliver?

13:29.658 --> 13:32.883
I'm just saying... I don't know.
Take a month or two off.

13:32.963 --> 13:35.994
Let your body recover, you know?

13:38.367 --> 13:40.800
Maggie wasn't there.

13:42.672 --> 13:45.127
Why wasn't she there?

13:50.479 --> 13:54.304
Hey, I dug up all the places
our guy visited before the possession.

13:54.384 --> 13:58.875
Aside from his office, he hung out
at Starbucks and low-rent strip clubs.

13:58.955 --> 14:01.343
Okay. Let's check it out.

14:01.423 --> 14:04.747
I'm gonna need surveillance tape
on the nights Henry visited.

14:05.227 --> 14:07.817
I want to see who he's
hanging out with at those strip clubs.

14:07.897 --> 14:10.052
I think I just heard Oliver volunteer.

14:10.132 --> 14:15.791
Oh! You cannot pay me enough money. No.
Besides, I have a date with reality tonight.

14:15.871 --> 14:18.227
Well, that sounds intriguing.

14:18.307 --> 14:21.380
- What's her name?
- Sara.

14:21.460 --> 14:24.530
- Wait a minute.
- What happened to Jenny?

14:24.610 --> 14:28.204
Jenny? Jenny wanted to go skydiving, so...

14:29.084 --> 14:32.041
You broke up with her
because she wanted to go skydiving?

14:32.121 --> 14:34.777
Yeah. You know how I feel about high places.

14:34.857 --> 14:38.147
- Hm.
- Oliver, have I taught you nothing?

14:38.227 --> 14:41.918
Oh, my God. I almost forgot. There's someone
named Camilla that's here to see you.

14:41.998 --> 14:45.831
She said she's from the Andrade Archdiocese.

14:49.337 --> 14:51.369
The Vatican?

15:02.083 --> 15:04.817
- Whoa. She's hot.
- Ugh!

15:09.591 --> 15:12.090
So should I tell her to go away?

15:15.598 --> 15:18.053
Tell her she's got five minutes.

15:18.133 --> 15:20.356
<i>I've been following your work
for quite some time.</i>

15:20.436 --> 15:23.659
I understand you've done
three exorcisms in the last six months.

15:23.739 --> 15:27.266
I prefer to call them evictions. Yes.

15:29.011 --> 15:32.735
- Why are you here?
- My superiors need an incarnate.

15:32.815 --> 15:35.405
What happened to Felix Nazra?

15:36.485 --> 15:39.942
They thought perhaps the student
has surpassed the teacher.

15:40.022 --> 15:43.279
Or they just got sick
of the body counts you leave behind.

15:43.359 --> 15:46.492
This situation needs a scalpel, not a hammer.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.731
Please.

16:11.820 --> 16:13.843
Camilla, right?

16:14.423 --> 16:16.879
You're wasting your time.
It's not gonna happen.

16:16.959 --> 16:19.548
I don't clock in for the Vatican.

16:19.628 --> 16:24.087
- What do you have against the Church?
- How much time you got?

16:25.167 --> 16:28.824
Look, I just don't believe what I do
belongs to any one religion.

16:28.904 --> 16:31.360
- Exorcising demons?
- No, to you, it's a demon.

16:31.440 --> 16:35.198
To others, it's an unclean spirit, it's jinn,
it's orisha. Take your pick, okay?

16:35.278 --> 16:39.368
Really, it's just a parasitic entity
in a non-corporeal transference.

16:39.448 --> 16:45.107
What if I told you a parasitic
entity just took a little boy?

16:45.187 --> 16:47.643
I would say it ain't my problem.

16:47.723 --> 16:49.835
What if I told you it was Maggie?

16:54.763 --> 16:57.198
I thought that would get your attention.

16:58.401 --> 17:00.122
Hmm...

17:03.539 --> 17:05.527
Let me guess.

17:05.807 --> 17:09.832
She's holed up in a half-dead body in a
whorehouse, just ready to be taken down.

17:09.912 --> 17:13.230
You need an incarnate because the ring
of St Vicinius and a piece of holy cloth

17:13.310 --> 17:15.220
- just won't cut it this time.
- I'm sorry.

17:15.300 --> 17:18.174
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Then let me make it crystal-clear.

17:18.253 --> 17:21.089
The last beautiful woman your superiors
sent here dangled the same carrot,

17:21.169 --> 17:25.013
"We're sure it's Maggie."
Well, surprise, it wasn't,

17:25.094 --> 17:27.371
just some lesser succubus who...

17:27.451 --> 17:30.286
turned a suburban housewife
into a heroin-addicted throat-cutter

17:30.366 --> 17:32.254
who nearly killed me and my assistants.

17:32.334 --> 17:36.625
Look, I have no idea
about the last woman they sent.

17:36.705 --> 17:39.987
What I do know is that I have
an archdemon possessing the body

17:40.067 --> 17:42.899
of an innocent 11-year-old boy.

17:43.479 --> 17:46.302
We believe that arch
is that entity you call Maggie.

17:46.382 --> 17:50.339
So if you and your assistants
really want to take her out...

17:50.419 --> 17:52.407
give me a call.

17:52.487 --> 17:56.989
Just don't wait too long. The boy
won't survive more than three days.

18:25.921 --> 18:28.510
- Ember.
- Is it her?

18:29.959 --> 18:32.223
Why don't you come inside?

18:41.036 --> 18:43.035
So this is what Vatican money buys?

18:44.874 --> 18:47.096
Can I offer you anything?

18:47.176 --> 18:50.966
I just need to know, Felix. Is it Maggie?

18:51.046 --> 18:52.834
Uncertain.

18:52.914 --> 18:55.070
The Church has excluded me from this one.

18:55.150 --> 18:58.841
Why? Because they can't stomach
the murder of a child?

18:58.921 --> 19:02.120
Or because they're afraid
they can't cover it up this time?

19:03.425 --> 19:06.249
Ember, remember where you are.

19:07.229 --> 19:09.427
And where's that?

19:09.865 --> 19:11.963
With a friend.

19:16.772 --> 19:20.629
Remember the first thing I taught you
about entering other people's minds?

19:20.709 --> 19:24.133
Humans are easily blinded
by their needs and desires.

19:24.213 --> 19:27.103
It would serve you well to remember that.

19:27.683 --> 19:30.606
We each have our methods.
We each have our motives.

19:30.686 --> 19:34.377
This conversation wouldn't have lasted
this long if you didn't know it was her.

19:34.957 --> 19:37.255
You know it's her, don't you?

19:39.028 --> 19:40.817
Yes.

19:41.497 --> 19:44.230
But if you haven't spoken to the Church...

19:45.368 --> 19:47.323
how do you know?

19:47.403 --> 19:49.717
I want to show you something.

19:58.680 --> 20:02.438
The door's glass is four inches thick.
A rhino couldn't crack it.

20:02.518 --> 20:05.574
There are 12 cameras inside and out,
monitored 24 hours a day.

20:05.654 --> 20:08.477
Fantastic. What is it?

20:08.557 --> 20:11.956
I've found the light agitates it.

20:17.999 --> 20:20.489
Is that a person? You got somebody
fucking locked up in there?

20:20.569 --> 20:23.692
Remember the incarnate
who disappeared last year?

20:23.772 --> 20:25.871
Luka Rejick.

20:42.358 --> 20:44.180
Shit!

20:45.360 --> 20:48.694
This hasn't been Luka Rejick
in a long time, I'm afraid.

20:50.199 --> 20:54.223
- What are you doing with him?
- They know a lot about us.

20:54.303 --> 20:56.570
Isn't it time we learned more about them?

20:59.777 --> 21:00.760
Jesus!

21:00.976 --> 21:04.891
Did you know they've been trying to
infiltrate our ranks for years? He told me.

21:05.171 --> 21:10.112
He also told me about the boy,
about Maggie. That's how I know.

21:10.192 --> 21:13.175
- What am I waiting for?
- Don't you want to know how to beat her?

21:13.255 --> 21:16.221
You know, Ember, sometimes...

21:19.128 --> 21:22.618
in order to avoid a fate worse than death,

21:22.698 --> 21:25.187
you must choose death instead.

21:25.267 --> 21:29.891
And thanks to Luka here,
I was able to develop this.

21:30.371 --> 21:33.862
- What is it?
- C-79.

21:33.942 --> 21:37.166
In this vial is a moment of clarity.

21:37.246 --> 21:38.667
What are you talking about?

21:38.747 --> 21:42.605
It's a serum made in part
from the blood of our friend here.

21:43.385 --> 21:46.942
Should Maggie get the upper hand,
and I hope she doesn't,

21:47.022 --> 21:49.945
this will give you approximately
10 seconds of lucidity

21:50.025 --> 21:53.299
in order to do what needs to be done.

21:53.729 --> 21:57.453
Inject this and you'll wake up
with just enough time

21:57.533 --> 22:01.190
to end your life
before she traps you forever.

22:01.270 --> 22:03.768
You seriously think I'm gonna use this?

22:05.741 --> 22:09.898
Look, Felix... I appreciate
everything you taught me.

22:09.978 --> 22:12.077
But keep your poison.

22:13.215 --> 22:15.447
I'm not planning on dying.

22:27.196 --> 22:28.750
<i>Hello?</i>

22:28.830 --> 22:32.408
Alright, Camilla. Let's talk.

22:39.475 --> 22:42.197
The boy's name is Cameron Sparrow.

22:42.277 --> 22:46.568
His parents just recently divorced.
The mother is originally from Holland.

22:46.648 --> 22:50.149
She has a restraining order
against the father, an alcoholic,

22:50.229 --> 22:52.283
he broke the boy's arm.

22:53.922 --> 22:56.979
Does Cameron have any history
of schizophrenia, delusion?

22:57.059 --> 23:00.115
- Any meds I should know about?
- No. Nothing in his records.

23:00.195 --> 23:03.896
The mother heard him scream in the kitchen.
And when she arrived...

23:04.376 --> 23:06.230
she found this.

23:08.937 --> 23:11.026
The boy broke her neck.

23:11.106 --> 23:15.331
Of course, we sent in the best exorcists
to handle the situation, but...

23:16.011 --> 23:17.376
they failed.

23:19.815 --> 23:23.205
- How does it transfer?
- Physical contact.

23:23.285 --> 23:26.088
Judging from its trail of victims,
it can only possess the weak,

23:26.168 --> 23:29.145
kids, the elderly, sick people.

23:29.925 --> 23:32.315
I haven't told the mother
about your connection with Maggie.

23:32.395 --> 23:36.985
- Is the boy quarantined?
- No one has touched Cameron in a week.

23:37.065 --> 23:39.221
- How's the mother's will?
- She's tired.

23:39.301 --> 23:43.000
She's been through a lot.
We're keeping her away from the boy.

23:45.107 --> 23:49.106
I've already answered
these questions a thousand times.

23:50.345 --> 23:52.134
- Who are you?
- Mrs. Sparrow...

23:52.214 --> 23:54.036
Just Lindsey, no Mrs.

23:54.116 --> 23:58.591
- Lindsey, we brought Dr. Ember to help you.
- Another priest. Great.

23:58.671 --> 24:02.302
No, he's not a priest. He's like a therapist.

24:02.382 --> 24:05.581
I'm not here to treat your son
for mental illness.

24:06.361 --> 24:09.185
- Then why are you here?
- I'm here to evaluate whether or not...

24:09.265 --> 24:12.688
Dr. Ember has employed a cutting-edge
method for helping his patients.

24:12.768 --> 24:17.026
He can go places we can't, get information
that'd otherwise be unavailable to us.

24:17.106 --> 24:20.347
- You're here to perform an exorcism, right?
- Let's get this straight off the bat.

24:20.427 --> 24:24.400
I don't do exorcisms. I don't use
religious methods to treat the symptoms.

24:24.480 --> 24:28.664
I go inside the victim's mind
to treat the disease.

24:29.084 --> 24:32.908
I don't compel these entities
from the outside. I evict them...

24:32.988 --> 24:35.845
- from the inside.
- You evict them?

24:36.025 --> 24:41.584
The entity that is holding your son
has no real power. It's a parasite.

24:41.664 --> 24:44.220
It feeds off your son's energy.

24:44.700 --> 24:47.656
But in order to do that,
it has to hold him in a dream state.

24:47.736 --> 24:50.983
Even if his eyes are open and he's speaking,
your son is asleep,

24:51.063 --> 24:52.494
the entity is controlling him.

24:52.574 --> 24:58.210
In order to keep that control,
it has to convince him his dream is real.

24:59.014 --> 25:01.270
It's holding Cameron by...

25:01.350 --> 25:03.906
convincing him he's in another reality?

25:03.986 --> 25:05.774
Yes.

25:06.454 --> 25:10.112
Through suggestion.
It rifles through his mind

25:10.192 --> 25:13.682
and shows him what he wants most,
but it's all a lie.

25:14.162 --> 25:16.427
I tear down the lies.

25:17.633 --> 25:22.190
Once Cameron sees the truth,
the entity loses its power.

25:22.270 --> 25:24.626
What happens to the entity?

25:24.706 --> 25:28.329
It'll try to jump
into the nearest living host.

25:28.409 --> 25:31.876
If it can't find a host, it dies.

25:35.184 --> 25:37.049
And you've done this before?

25:53.368 --> 25:56.891
<i>Strap her down. Strap her down!</i>

25:57.571 --> 25:59.828
Oh, God.

26:10.135 --> 26:12.032
Okay.

26:18.460 --> 26:20.486
Hello, Father.

26:21.296 --> 26:25.521
- The boy hasn't eaten in days.
- Why don't you take a break?

26:25.601 --> 26:28.199
You look like you need some rest.

26:31.540 --> 26:33.571
He's okay.

26:39.847 --> 26:43.205
It might be best
if you waited in the living room.

26:43.285 --> 26:46.775
- But I want to see him.
- I know. I know. But...

26:46.855 --> 26:52.089
You have to trust us.
He'll be fine. It's gonna be okay.

26:59.034 --> 27:01.324
This is just an evaluation.

27:02.404 --> 27:06.671
If I can't confirm this is Maggie,
I'm outta here.

27:39.975 --> 27:42.240
Hello, Dr. Ember.

27:43.678 --> 27:45.776
You know who I am?

27:48.417 --> 27:50.448
How does it feel?

27:52.087 --> 27:54.318
How does what feel?

27:56.425 --> 28:00.057
To lose the one you love.

28:09.521 --> 28:11.153
Okay.

28:13.408 --> 28:16.474
We've established that you know who I am.

28:19.314 --> 28:21.345
Who are you?

28:21.783 --> 28:24.273
I've been known as Ash.

28:24.553 --> 28:26.551
Others have called me Plague.

28:28.290 --> 28:32.847
After the Great Deluge,
when the angels took the mortal woman,

28:32.927 --> 28:35.360
I was Desire.

28:39.467 --> 28:41.290
Is this fun for you?

28:42.370 --> 28:47.405
Holy water, crucifixes
and idle threats get so...

28:48.510 --> 28:49.832
dull.

28:49.912 --> 28:52.067
What do you want?

28:52.147 --> 28:54.703
You're gonna have to try harder than that.

28:54.783 --> 28:57.773
No. I don't have time for this.

28:58.153 --> 28:59.984
Good!

29:09.297 --> 29:11.028
Ah.

29:12.267 --> 29:14.531
So you do remember.

29:18.707 --> 29:21.429
Hey. Hey, hey.

29:21.509 --> 29:24.533
Hey, where are you going? What about the boy?

29:24.913 --> 29:27.202
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

29:27.282 --> 29:29.113
Wait.

29:29.985 --> 29:31.730
Is it her?

29:33.322 --> 29:36.878
- I know what happened to your family.
- Don't you ever mention my family.

29:36.958 --> 29:40.415
But if this is an archdemon,
the Church needs to know.

29:40.495 --> 29:42.217
A lot of lives could be in jeopardy.

29:42.297 --> 29:45.140
Then move out of my way
so I can get my team in here.

29:46.500 --> 29:49.266
Then I'd lock that door, if I were you.

31:05.430 --> 31:07.328
I'm coming for you.

31:37.045 --> 31:39.167
The Church is pleased
that you have come to help.

31:39.247 --> 31:41.069
Helping? I'm hunting.

31:41.149 --> 31:45.740
Excuse me, but is this necessary?
Why can I not be in the same room as my son?

31:45.820 --> 31:50.111
When the shit hits the fan, I'm gonna
need everybody in here out of my hair.

31:50.191 --> 31:53.658
- It's safer that way, believe me.
- You should see an image.

31:57.499 --> 31:59.763
Oh, Cameron.

32:13.548 --> 32:15.770
What is all this stuff?

32:15.850 --> 32:20.673
Um... this is what we use to monitor
Dr. Ember during dives.

32:21.356 --> 32:24.379
See, each of us is like a wi-fi hot spot,

32:24.459 --> 32:27.282
and our brains give off
an invisible field of energy.

32:27.362 --> 32:31.119
You see this cloud right here?
Some people call this an aura or a soul,

32:31.199 --> 32:34.456
but really what it is
is just a cluster of unique ions,

32:34.536 --> 32:36.658
and each of us has our own frequency.

32:36.738 --> 32:40.295
So this is Dr. Ember's and this is Cameron's.

32:40.375 --> 32:43.932
You see the black streaks in Cameron's?
That's the parasite.

32:44.012 --> 32:47.302
If a victim is weak, it can hook
right into their frequency.

32:47.682 --> 32:49.538
Oh, God.

32:49.668 --> 32:53.614
So we just use this
to monitor it until we can evict it.

32:55.957 --> 32:58.212
What's all that for?

32:58.292 --> 33:02.192
Uh, this is gonna lower his heart rate
and EEG to a stasis state,

33:02.272 --> 33:06.020
leaving the brain as close to death
as physically possible.

33:06.100 --> 33:10.959
When I hit REM, I'll ride into Cameron's
subconscious, begin dismantling the illusion.

33:11.039 --> 33:14.458
The trick is I only have eight minutes
before my heart gives out,

33:14.538 --> 33:16.664
which isn't a lot of time.

33:16.744 --> 33:19.934
Sometimes we get lucky.
It's as easy as the glitch.

33:20.014 --> 33:22.937
- The glitch?
- The time glitch.

33:23.017 --> 33:26.007
We've discovered that time
is meaningless in the subconscious,

33:26.087 --> 33:29.044
so watches, clocks, anything that tells time,

33:29.124 --> 33:32.189
freezes at the time
of the victim's possession.

33:37.699 --> 33:40.021
It'll be okay.

33:40.101 --> 33:42.533
I'm gonna help your son.

33:54.048 --> 33:55.770
Okay, boss. You're good to go.

33:55.850 --> 33:59.157
Keep this area clear in case he tries
to jump. You know the drill.

33:59.237 --> 34:02.644
Don't let the boy touch you or anyone else.
Don't let me touch you or anyone else.

34:02.724 --> 34:07.148
Oliver, I get anywhere near flatlining,
you yank my ass out with the Narcan.

34:07.228 --> 34:09.851
Yeah. I've got the escape hatch
right here, boss.

34:09.931 --> 34:12.196
Only if you absolutely have to.

34:12.567 --> 34:14.431
Dr. Ember.

34:16.938 --> 34:19.168
Good luck in there.

34:19.974 --> 34:21.806
Thank you.

34:44.833 --> 34:48.780
Dr. Ember. So nice of you to join us.

35:09.057 --> 35:11.388
Starting the clock, boss.

35:20.435 --> 35:22.800
Are you ready, Dr. Ember?

35:25.306 --> 35:28.139
Then let the games begin.

36:01.709 --> 36:05.110
Nice, Cameron. Keep it going.
Fastball next, buddy.

36:05.813 --> 36:08.003
Over the plate. Nice!

36:08.583 --> 36:10.438
Nice catch.

36:10.718 --> 36:12.307
Beautiful.

36:13.087 --> 36:15.076
How is he?

36:15.756 --> 36:18.923
Seven minutes to go. So far, so good.

36:22.397 --> 36:24.119
Cameron.

36:24.599 --> 36:28.489
Cameron. Listen, I know you don't know me.

36:28.569 --> 36:32.403
But I'm here to help you.
I just want to talk.

36:34.475 --> 36:36.364
What's wrong?

36:36.444 --> 36:39.843
You're... you're bleeding.

36:49.524 --> 36:52.413
- What?
- Help! We need help over here.

36:52.493 --> 36:54.015
- Oh, no.
- Cameron.

36:54.095 --> 36:56.551
Cameron, come with me, buddy. Come on.

36:56.631 --> 36:59.087
- Wait. Cameron.
- It's okay. You'll be okay.

36:59.167 --> 37:01.789
Sir, I need to lay you down.

37:04.905 --> 37:09.531
No, no, no, no, no. Lie down. Lie down.
You need to lie down. This is serious.

37:09.611 --> 37:11.842
No, no. Hold on.

37:26.828 --> 37:28.859
Oh, crap!

37:33.167 --> 37:36.257
- He's gonna flatline.
- Uh, there's a man bleeding.

37:36.337 --> 37:39.060
I'm in the south-east section
of Douglas Park.

37:39.140 --> 37:41.379
Get away from me. This isn't happening.

37:41.459 --> 37:45.219
You have to calm down.
I'm not sure what's wrong.

37:47.882 --> 37:50.965
Sir. I think I've found your problem.

38:00.060 --> 38:02.183
I'm sorry, boss.

38:02.263 --> 38:05.619
Your EKGs were off the chart,
okay, so we had to pull you out.

38:17.010 --> 38:20.768
- Well, I'm not gonna say I told you so.
- Yeah, well, you just did. Alright, boss.

38:20.848 --> 38:23.770
Let's get you to the hospital,
get you checked out, okay?

38:23.850 --> 38:27.408
- I'm fine, Oliver.
- You're fine?

38:27.988 --> 38:30.193
What the hell happened in there?

38:30.273 --> 38:32.747
It was only a few minutes, Oliver.

38:32.827 --> 38:35.116
A couple of minutes?

38:35.196 --> 38:38.062
Boss, your heart stopped.

38:42.837 --> 38:45.035
Where are you going?

39:26.213 --> 39:29.871
Dan used to play in the park
with Cameron, before he lost his job.

39:29.951 --> 39:31.890
The entity is playing into Cameron's desire.

39:31.970 --> 39:36.528
His desire? That man has never said
"I love you" once to that boy.

39:36.608 --> 39:38.997
Cameron doesn't want anything
to do with his father, believe me.

39:39.077 --> 39:43.117
Maybe you don't want that, but I'm
telling you, Dan was in the park with him.

39:43.197 --> 39:45.587
She's giving him what he wants.

39:46.167 --> 39:48.932
We need to break down her illusion.

39:49.670 --> 39:52.068
It's the only way to free the boy.

39:55.342 --> 39:58.338
- Where's his father?
- He's probably getting drunk.

39:58.418 --> 40:01.435
- We need to bring him here.
- That man is not coming anywhere near my son.

40:01.515 --> 40:03.438
- Listen...
- He broke Cameron's arm!

40:03.518 --> 40:07.342
This entity is strong. Probably
the strongest I've ever encountered.

40:07.422 --> 40:10.245
To get your son back, I'm gonna
need all the ammunition I can get.

40:10.325 --> 40:15.049
- No. It's not gonna happen. I'm sorry.
- Damn it, listen to me! I am too close.

40:15.129 --> 40:17.594
I have come too far.

40:18.366 --> 40:22.065
So you either work with me
or you lose your son.

40:24.205 --> 40:28.238
Ms. Sparrow, just please tell us
where to find him.

40:40.588 --> 40:43.345
There's a bar on 20th and Scarborough.

40:44.125 --> 40:46.390
That's where he usually goes.

40:47.262 --> 40:48.993
Thank you.

41:07.720 --> 41:09.513
Hey!

41:09.984 --> 41:11.506
I'm in a wheelchair.

41:11.586 --> 41:14.475
I can see you're not a fan
of self-preservation.

41:14.555 --> 41:18.246
- Yeah, not much left to preserve.
- Is that self-pity I hear?

41:18.326 --> 41:21.949
No. That's freedom, baby. Freedom.

41:22.029 --> 41:24.428
Focus on the important shit.

41:27.168 --> 41:29.766
Mmm. Found him.

41:30.838 --> 41:33.003
Mr. Sparrow.

41:35.743 --> 41:38.099
Your son's in trouble.
I need you to come with me.

41:38.179 --> 41:42.212
- What are you, another lawyer?
- Do I look like a lawyer?

41:44.251 --> 41:46.716
Your son is in trouble.

41:48.322 --> 41:50.145
Yeah, well...

41:50.725 --> 41:53.591
I need another beer,
so unless you're buying...

41:55.162 --> 41:57.291
You're so funny.

42:06.840 --> 42:08.511
You want me to break your arm, huh?

42:09.691 --> 42:11.332
I don't know what they told you,
but I never touched him.

42:11.412 --> 42:13.634
I don't give a shit.

42:13.914 --> 42:18.239
I said your son's in trouble...
because of you.

42:19.119 --> 42:21.250
Dr. Ember!

42:24.925 --> 42:27.057
Ember, stop!

42:42.175 --> 42:44.891
- Why didn't you call me?
- You're here, aren't you?

42:44.971 --> 42:48.435
Jesus Christ, Lindsey! How long
were you gonna keep this from me?

42:48.515 --> 42:51.605
- Why would I tell you anything?
- Because he's my son!

42:51.685 --> 42:54.351
If we're done flirting here?

42:55.589 --> 43:00.422
- Cameron needs us.
- Dan. You need to go with Dr. Ember now.

43:02.963 --> 43:05.358
Show me where my son is.

43:05.438 --> 43:07.097
With pleasure.

43:12.573 --> 43:16.063
Call him by his name. Remind him
you're in the room. Tell him you love him.

43:16.143 --> 43:19.583
Talk about details that only you
and he would know about.

43:19.663 --> 43:23.871
Okay? He'll hear you. He'll wake up.

43:23.951 --> 43:27.075
- You sure this is gonna work?
- No. I'm not.

43:27.155 --> 43:32.312
- Then why should I do this?
- I would. If it were my son.

43:32.392 --> 43:34.548
Like I said before,
I don't know what they told you, okay,

43:34.628 --> 43:36.984
but I never touched him, okay, ever.

43:37.064 --> 43:40.287
- I never touched him.
- Save it for Cameron.

43:40.367 --> 43:42.923
Alright, we have your back,
if something goes wrong,

43:43.003 --> 43:45.526
you get a bad feeling, we'll get you out.

43:45.606 --> 43:48.629
Like what? What's gonna happen?
Like green vomit?

43:48.709 --> 43:51.165
Are you talking about the whole
head-turning thing? Come on!

43:51.245 --> 43:52.954
- No matter what, don't touch him.
- Come on.

43:53.034 --> 43:55.503
Dan, I mean it.

43:55.983 --> 43:59.073
No physical contact. Do you understand me?

43:59.653 --> 44:03.519
Yeah, I won't... I won't touch him.

44:06.660 --> 44:08.525
Let's go.

44:24.845 --> 44:27.034
Hey, Cam.

44:27.114 --> 44:29.579
It's me. It's Dad.

44:31.852 --> 44:34.349
It's been a while, buddy. I haven't...

44:34.829 --> 44:37.286
Haven't seen you, like, forever.

44:37.566 --> 44:41.658
<i>You know, I tried calling a few times.
I guess my messages weren't getting through.</i>

44:44.264 --> 44:46.521
I remember you had that sick curve ball.

44:47.701 --> 44:50.206
Just me and you down at the park.

44:53.107 --> 44:56.206
You were good, man.
You should try out for the team.

44:58.245 --> 45:00.167
Cameron.

45:00.247 --> 45:02.312
It's Dad.

45:03.050 --> 45:05.794
Slow and easy.

45:13.093 --> 45:15.860
It's working. Cameron's surfacing.

45:22.570 --> 45:26.369
- Dad?
- Yeah, buddy, it's me. It's Dad.

45:33.647 --> 45:36.417
Cameron, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry I hurt you.

45:37.017 --> 45:39.607
You've gotta believe me. It was an accident.

45:42.889 --> 45:45.322
If I could take it back, I'd take it back.

45:47.194 --> 45:50.184
- What do we got?
- There's a lot of movement.

45:50.264 --> 45:53.287
Yeah, it's bouncing around
all over the place.

45:53.767 --> 45:57.124
What happened to you, Cameron?
How did this happen?

45:57.204 --> 45:59.293
I forgive you.

45:59.573 --> 46:03.364
What? I can't... I can't hear you,
buddy. Say it... say it again.

46:04.244 --> 46:07.210
I forgive you, Dad.

46:11.218 --> 46:13.206
You do?

46:13.286 --> 46:15.843
Yeah. I want it to be like it was.

46:16.223 --> 46:20.578
- Can it be like before?
- Yeah. It can be like before. Promise.

46:21.828 --> 46:24.795
I'm gonna clean up. Okay?

46:25.566 --> 46:28.021
I'll do anything for you.

46:28.101 --> 46:30.424
Can we go to the park again?

46:31.104 --> 46:33.428
We can go to the park.

46:33.908 --> 46:37.598
We can go to a carnival.
You want to go on the rides?

46:37.678 --> 46:41.118
- We can do all that.
- Really?

46:41.748 --> 46:44.510
Really. Just as soon as you're better, okay?

46:47.388 --> 46:49.410
I love you, Dad.

46:50.659 --> 46:52.588
Cam...

46:54.428 --> 46:57.551
- Oh, my God!
- No, stay back! Don't touch him!

46:58.231 --> 47:01.311
- Oh, God!
- God is not here.

47:06.039 --> 47:09.840
Stop! Don't do this. It's me you want.

47:34.601 --> 47:37.834
Please follow me. Our people are downstairs.

47:55.088 --> 47:57.217
Why did you say, "It's me you want"?

47:59.827 --> 48:02.379
There's something you're not telling me.

48:04.332 --> 48:06.730
You're not here to help Cameron.

48:08.852 --> 48:11.001
You're here for some other reason.

48:13.740 --> 48:17.772
- Doesn't matter why I'm here.
- Dan is dead!

48:18.212 --> 48:20.677
What the hell is going on here?

48:21.982 --> 48:24.448
Talk to me or get the hell out!

48:35.195 --> 48:37.427
When I was 26...

48:39.934 --> 48:42.599
I discovered that when I was asleep...

48:43.971 --> 48:46.457
I could go into the minds of the possessed.

48:47.941 --> 48:50.698
When I found out there were others like me...

48:51.678 --> 48:54.911
and how their lives
had been turned upside-down...

48:57.117 --> 48:59.515
I kept my abilities hidden.

49:01.421 --> 49:03.853
I just wanted a normal life.

49:07.327 --> 49:09.550
And that's what I had.

50:11.892 --> 50:13.623
No.

50:29.977 --> 50:31.675
No.

50:54.468 --> 50:56.451
<i>She was possessed?</i>

50:57.170 --> 50:59.594
Her name was Maggie Grant.

51:00.574 --> 51:04.149
She was possessed
by the same entity that's in Cameron.

51:04.845 --> 51:07.067
She sensed my ability.

51:08.347 --> 51:10.463
She killed my wife...

51:10.543 --> 51:12.949
and my 11-year-old boy.

51:14.722 --> 51:16.786
After that...

51:19.059 --> 51:21.324
there's no turning back.

51:23.697 --> 51:26.653
Since then, I've used every ability I have...

51:26.733 --> 51:29.189
to try to find her and kill her.

51:29.269 --> 51:31.835
You're not here to help my son.

51:32.907 --> 51:35.972
No. I'm not.

51:39.112 --> 51:42.659
In all these years,
why hasn't she just killed you?

51:48.989 --> 51:51.454
There are fates worse than death.

52:18.886 --> 52:20.971
I was afraid of this.

52:21.721 --> 52:23.744
She's feeding!

52:24.424 --> 52:25.864
What's happening?

52:25.944 --> 52:29.082
Maggie's feeding.
She's consuming Cameron's energy.

52:29.436 --> 52:31.657
We need to move fast.

52:33.934 --> 52:36.323
Boss! Boss!

52:36.403 --> 52:38.930
The kid's got maybe two hours max.
What's the call?

52:39.010 --> 52:42.696
Don't let anyone near him.
Do whatever it takes to keep him alive.

52:42.776 --> 52:46.797
- Where are you going?
- To get the edge I need to end this.

52:52.820 --> 52:54.918
Keep it running.

53:00.160 --> 53:01.925
Felix!

53:06.266 --> 53:09.197
Hello? Felix?

53:11.104 --> 53:12.835
Felix?

53:14.708 --> 53:16.346
Felix, you here?

54:21.942 --> 54:23.673
Felix!

54:24.911 --> 54:27.358
Felix! Felix.

54:27.848 --> 54:29.778
It's Ember.

54:30.750 --> 54:33.807
- What happened?
- I was harvesting more blood.

54:33.887 --> 54:36.243
He broke through the straitjacket and bolted.

54:36.323 --> 54:40.682
- Where are you hurt?
- It's not my blood. I cut him.

54:41.852 --> 54:44.894
Ember, we gotta get out of here.
I think he's still here.

54:46.532 --> 54:48.731
Alright. Let's move.

55:34.714 --> 55:36.536
Whoops.

55:36.716 --> 55:38.405
Felix...

55:38.885 --> 55:40.683
No.

55:41.321 --> 55:43.849
- Stay back.
- Or what?

56:09.082 --> 56:12.330
- What are you waiting for?
- Ember, if only you...

56:24.031 --> 56:26.019
Felix? Felix.

56:26.099 --> 56:29.027
- Maggie wants you for herself.
- No, Felix.

56:29.107 --> 56:31.059
- She's gonna consume you.
- Felix!

56:31.139 --> 56:35.135
- Pray you die so easily.
- Felix! No!

56:53.827 --> 56:56.150
Where have you been?

56:56.830 --> 56:59.887
- I had to get something. How is he?
- He's stable.

56:59.967 --> 57:02.522
- He hasn't moved since you left.
- Alright, let's go.

57:02.602 --> 57:04.738
Where do you think you're going?

57:06.940 --> 57:09.963
- I'm going back in.
- No, you're not.

57:10.043 --> 57:12.505
I need to talk to you.

57:18.851 --> 57:21.499
Look, I don't know where you went,
but you're not gonna go back in,

57:21.579 --> 57:23.343
I'm calling in my people.

57:23.423 --> 57:26.179
If you were gonna call in your people
to contain this you'd have done it.

57:26.259 --> 57:29.416
What happens when this entity's done
with the kid and decides to jump?

57:29.496 --> 57:31.818
- She's not gonna jump.
- Why not?

57:31.898 --> 57:34.888
Because it's me she wants. I'm sport to her.

57:34.968 --> 57:37.733
Which is why I'm your best shot right now.

57:40.974 --> 57:43.687
I need a physical item of Cameron's.
Something special to him.

57:43.767 --> 57:45.332
Why?

57:45.412 --> 57:49.302
We need to find a truth
that she can't distort...

57:49.782 --> 57:52.906
intimate truth that he won't question.

57:53.586 --> 57:56.776
It's our only chance
of shattering his illusion,

57:56.856 --> 57:58.871
pulling him out.

58:04.731 --> 58:07.596
This ring, you know where it is?

58:10.637 --> 58:13.236
Cameron used to keep this by his bed.

58:15.008 --> 58:17.697
And when we left, I took it away.

58:18.077 --> 58:21.250
I wanted as few traces
of his father as possible.

58:21.815 --> 58:24.203
I can't think of anything...

58:24.283 --> 58:26.906
Cameron treasured more than this...

58:26.986 --> 58:28.872
stupid ring.

58:29.522 --> 58:32.755
You can tell me to shut up
any time you want, but, uh...

58:35.228 --> 58:37.885
I think Cameron loves his father, but...

58:38.465 --> 58:41.487
I mean, that doesn't mean
he doesn't love you.

58:43.836 --> 58:46.959
I mean, Cameron might not know
how to say it, but...

58:47.039 --> 58:49.262
I mean, you're his rock.

58:49.842 --> 58:52.265
You're his entire world.

58:52.745 --> 58:55.102
He needs you now more than ever.

58:56.082 --> 58:57.847
Lindsey...

59:00.453 --> 59:02.609
I need you...

59:02.689 --> 59:04.444
to be strong.

59:04.524 --> 59:08.014
We're getting close.
She shouldn't have killed Dan.

59:08.494 --> 59:12.161
Maggie's getting sloppy
and we will use that against her.

59:15.635 --> 59:17.892
I'm gonna get your son back.

59:19.472 --> 59:21.761
I thought you didn't care.

59:21.841 --> 59:23.906
Yeah, well...

59:26.713 --> 59:28.844
I lied.

59:58.611 --> 01:00:00.342
Here.

01:00:02.581 --> 01:00:03.971
You sure about this?

01:00:04.151 --> 01:00:09.176
If I get the boy out and I'm still down,
you get that into my IV.

01:00:10.256 --> 01:00:13.079
If it works, it'll buy me just enough time.

01:00:13.159 --> 01:00:15.582
Enough time for what?

01:00:16.162 --> 01:00:18.928
Enough time to get the job done.

01:00:19.699 --> 01:00:21.930
Whatever you say, boss.

01:00:39.652 --> 01:00:43.043
- Oliver, you got the Narcan?
- Yeah.

01:00:44.123 --> 01:00:46.212
Right here. Ready to go.

01:00:46.292 --> 01:00:48.323
Let me see it.

01:00:53.733 --> 01:00:56.065
Won't be needing this anymore.

01:01:20.493 --> 01:01:23.867
I hope you said your goodbyes.

01:01:25.131 --> 01:01:28.622
Because you won't be coming back.

01:01:29.402 --> 01:01:31.166
Maybe.

01:01:35.709 --> 01:01:38.064
But neither will you.

01:01:53.526 --> 01:01:55.417
Sir?

01:01:56.244 --> 01:01:58.012
Sir?

01:01:58.464 --> 01:02:00.853
Are you gonna take your ticket or not?

01:02:35.753 --> 01:02:38.100
Alright. Here we go.

01:02:41.641 --> 01:02:44.442
Cam, look at that. That looks good, man.

01:02:45.912 --> 01:02:48.435
Hey, Cameron. How about some cotton candy?

01:02:48.515 --> 01:02:50.804
Oh! Jesus, I will never get used to that.

01:02:50.884 --> 01:02:52.205
You're telling me.

01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:07.029
Cameron!

01:03:09.235 --> 01:03:11.099
Cameron!

01:03:15.874 --> 01:03:17.739
Cameron!

01:03:19.946 --> 01:03:23.135
- Dad, it's the guy from the park.
- No worries.

01:03:23.515 --> 01:03:25.805
Cameron, I'm here to help you.

01:03:25.885 --> 01:03:27.941
Why don't you back off
before someone gets hurt?

01:03:28.021 --> 01:03:30.576
This is not your father, Cameron.
This is not real.

01:03:30.656 --> 01:03:33.212
- What are you talking about?
- I know it's confusing.

01:03:33.292 --> 01:03:35.095
- You're just gonna have to trust me.
- Dad!

01:03:35.175 --> 01:03:37.525
Get away from my son.

01:03:39.332 --> 01:03:42.922
You know what, this is gonna
end badly for you, man.

01:03:43.202 --> 01:03:47.184
Cameron, don't be afraid.
Do you remember this ring?

01:03:49.576 --> 01:03:52.631
You used to sleep with it, remember?

01:03:53.011 --> 01:03:55.268
- Dad?
- It's not your dad, Cameron.

01:03:55.348 --> 01:03:58.071
It looks like your dad,
saying everything you want to hear.

01:03:58.151 --> 01:04:00.273
- But it's not your father.
- Give me the ring, Cameron.

01:04:00.353 --> 01:04:04.677
You know what, you're a frickin' psycho.
You stay away from my son.

01:04:04.757 --> 01:04:08.147
You know I'd never hurt you, son. Okay?

01:04:08.227 --> 01:04:10.083
I love you, Cameron.

01:04:10.163 --> 01:04:12.125
Cameron?

01:04:12.265 --> 01:04:14.954
Your father could never say he loved you.

01:04:15.334 --> 01:04:17.866
You ever heard him say those words?

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.929
Don't listen to him, Cam. Okay?

01:04:23.009 --> 01:04:25.832
Hey. I said get out of here.

01:04:25.912 --> 01:04:29.944
You know your dad better than anyone.
This is not your dad.

01:04:30.024 --> 01:04:32.171
Don't listen to him, Cameron.

01:04:32.251 --> 01:04:34.750
I'm sorry. Sorry.

01:04:36.022 --> 01:04:38.210
What's wrong, Cam?

01:04:38.290 --> 01:04:39.779
Dad?

01:04:39.859 --> 01:04:42.385
What's wrong, buddy?
Why you looking at me like that?

01:04:42.465 --> 01:04:44.383
It's not your dad, Cameron.

01:04:44.463 --> 01:04:47.575
- This guy's done something to you, Cam.
- Stay away from me.

01:04:47.655 --> 01:04:50.871
I would never hurt you. Ever.

01:04:51.771 --> 01:04:53.780
You're not my dad.

01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:56.396
Cameron, stop!

01:04:56.976 --> 01:04:59.432
He's coming up on four minutes.

01:04:59.812 --> 01:05:01.710
Cameron!

01:05:03.099 --> 01:05:05.371
- Stay away from me!
- Cameron! Cameron, trust me.

01:05:05.451 --> 01:05:07.974
- I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?
- What's happening?

01:05:08.054 --> 01:05:09.852
Cameron!

01:05:11.891 --> 01:05:13.722
Come on!

01:05:13.994 --> 01:05:15.849
Cameron!

01:05:19.298 --> 01:05:21.722
Come back, Cameron! Come back!

01:05:21.802 --> 01:05:24.361
Come on. We gotta keep moving.

01:05:29.575 --> 01:05:31.998
Don't trust him! He's a bad man!

01:05:32.078 --> 01:05:34.500
He wants to hurt you.

01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:37.837
- Cameron!
- Cameron. Shh! It's okay.

01:05:37.917 --> 01:05:40.940
- What's wrong with me?
- There's nothing wrong with you.

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:44.161
- This isn't real.
- It feels real.

01:05:44.241 --> 01:05:46.045
That's because you believe it.

01:05:46.125 --> 01:05:49.415
Stop believing it
and I promise you it'll go away.

01:05:49.495 --> 01:05:51.317
You can make all of this disappear.

01:05:51.397 --> 01:05:54.887
I just need you to listen to me
right now. Can you do that?

01:05:55.241 --> 01:05:59.167
- O... okay.
- Okay. Do you have a favorite color?

01:06:00.506 --> 01:06:03.472
- Blue.
- Oh, that's good. Mine too.

01:06:07.013 --> 01:06:09.211
You see that blue door?

01:06:10.683 --> 01:06:14.907
It's your world, Cameron.
You can control everything in it.

01:06:15.087 --> 01:06:19.093
It's your way out. Hurry.
Your mom's waiting for you.

01:06:26.165 --> 01:06:29.197
Go ahead. It's gonna be okay.

01:06:34.607 --> 01:06:36.906
Now you're in trouble, Cameron.

01:06:39.278 --> 01:06:42.637
Go through the door, Cameron, now!
You won't get another chance.

01:06:49.188 --> 01:06:52.694
- He's got less than a minute.
- He's cutting it too close.

01:06:53.692 --> 01:06:55.198
Oh, come on, boss.

01:07:02.001 --> 01:07:04.957
Go through the door! Go through the door!

01:07:05.037 --> 01:07:09.205
I'm done with the boy.
I'm going after the bitch that spawned him.

01:07:20.319 --> 01:07:25.120
- There's only one place you're going.
- Yeah. And I'm taking you with me.

01:07:35.501 --> 01:07:37.530
You remember this?

01:07:37.610 --> 01:07:42.612
You remember? My wife was
wearing this the night you killed her.

01:07:42.692 --> 01:07:45.391
I want you to wear it now.

01:08:06.299 --> 01:08:08.396
10 seconds.

01:08:11.337 --> 01:08:13.435
Cameron!

01:08:15.308 --> 01:08:17.113
No!

01:08:33.926 --> 01:08:37.091
Cameron! You did it!

01:08:40.899 --> 01:08:43.812
- Cameron?
- Mom.

01:08:54.514 --> 01:08:57.312
Oh... thank you.

01:09:00.051 --> 01:09:02.082
Thank you.

01:09:14.299 --> 01:09:16.689
Hey, boss.

01:09:16.769 --> 01:09:20.309
- How many fingers am I holding up?
- Get your thumb out of my face.

01:09:22.524 --> 01:09:26.341
- You're gonna be just fine, boss.
- Can we take a vacation now?

01:09:26.979 --> 01:09:29.902
Dad? Can you hear me?

01:09:30.741 --> 01:09:32.938
Is it you, Dad?

01:09:34.787 --> 01:09:37.839
<i>Dad? Dad?</i>

01:09:37.919 --> 01:09:39.412
Dad!

01:09:39.492 --> 01:09:42.689
Dad? Dad?

01:09:43.529 --> 01:09:46.127
Mom! Dad's awake.

01:09:48.167 --> 01:09:51.357
- Hey.
- Where am I? Anna?

01:09:51.737 --> 01:09:53.862
Can you hear us?

01:09:55.942 --> 01:09:59.182
- What happened?
- We were in a car accident.

01:09:59.412 --> 01:10:02.134
- The car went off the road.
- A woman hit us.

01:10:02.214 --> 01:10:05.037
No, no, honey. You swerved around a jogger.

01:10:05.817 --> 01:10:08.049
You don't remember.

01:10:08.650 --> 01:10:12.355
You had a concussion. The doctor
said that you might be disoriented.

01:10:15.962 --> 01:10:18.627
You were in a coma for three days.

01:10:23.269 --> 01:10:25.324
- How you doing, buddy?
- Good.

01:10:25.404 --> 01:10:26.736
Yeah?

01:11:15.054 --> 01:11:17.086
Felt so real.

01:11:22.662 --> 01:11:24.690
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:11:43.415 --> 01:11:45.163
Honey, this way.

01:11:45.243 --> 01:11:47.740
Hey, Dad. So you up for some
one-on-one when we get home?

01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:50.042
No basketball for him, honey.
He needs to rest.

01:11:50.122 --> 01:11:52.445
Then can we play on the Wii?

01:11:53.225 --> 01:11:55.290
I'd like that, Jake.

01:11:57.796 --> 01:11:59.651
I love you.

01:11:59.731 --> 01:12:01.563
I love you.

01:12:12.578 --> 01:12:14.876
Honey, what's wrong?

01:12:16.856 --> 01:12:18.684
Dad, what is it?

01:12:20.786 --> 01:12:22.292
What's wrong?

01:12:23.622 --> 01:12:25.420
No.

01:12:29.028 --> 01:12:30.817
You're not real.

01:12:31.897 --> 01:12:35.955
- Seth. Seth, don't say that.
- I love you both.

01:12:36.035 --> 01:12:37.790
- You're not real.
- Dad!

01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:40.769
- Seth, come back!
- Dad!

01:12:42.592 --> 01:12:44.564
Going somewhere?

01:12:44.644 --> 01:12:46.332
Maggie.

01:12:48.047 --> 01:12:49.636
Oh, shit!

01:12:57.222 --> 01:12:59.921
- No!
- Maggie!

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:03.105
Why don't you just kill me?

01:13:03.185 --> 01:13:05.818
Because I want you to hurt, Seth.

01:13:05.898 --> 01:13:08.464
I want you to know pain.

01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:13.535
You're gonna burn, Seth.

01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:32.921
Think! Think! Think!

01:13:50.008 --> 01:13:52.240
Oh, my God!

01:14:35.087 --> 01:14:37.118
Let him go.

01:14:38.357 --> 01:14:40.580
I'll stop fighting.

01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:43.692
You can have me.

01:14:47.182 --> 01:14:49.576
Release him or I'll jump.

01:14:53.051 --> 01:14:56.005
- Open the door!
- Open the door, Cameron!

01:14:56.085 --> 01:14:58.764
Cameron! Cameron, buddy,
we need you to open the door.

01:14:58.844 --> 01:15:01.916
- Cameron, we need you to open this door.
- Cameron!

01:15:02.046 --> 01:15:06.171
Can you hear me, buddy? Can you hear me?
Just come open the door.

01:15:21.766 --> 01:15:23.689
No, Oliver!

01:15:23.769 --> 01:15:25.691
Boss?

01:15:36.915 --> 01:15:38.980
It's injected!

01:15:43.155 --> 01:15:44.914
Boss...

01:15:48.894 --> 01:15:50.761
Boss?

01:15:54.366 --> 01:15:56.188
Boss?

01:16:10.816 --> 01:16:12.614
No!

01:16:17.656 --> 01:16:19.865
You end now, bitch!

01:16:19.945 --> 01:16:21.981
No!

01:16:22.161 --> 01:16:23.772
No!

01:16:34.439 --> 01:16:37.296
No! No! Don't touch him! Don't touch him!

01:17:35.334 --> 01:17:37.223
Let's move!

01:17:39.771 --> 01:17:42.821
Here we go. The guy's in shock. Clear!

01:17:46.911 --> 01:17:48.737
Here we go. Clear!

01:17:52.418 --> 01:17:54.773
Come on, Ember, fight.

01:17:55.553 --> 01:17:58.243
Here we go again. Clear.

01:18:06.665 --> 01:18:09.270
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, just one more time.

01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:11.849
- Ma'am.
- Now!

01:18:14.906 --> 01:18:17.996
Clear, all clear. Clear!

01:18:32.257 --> 01:18:34.722
Oh, my God. We've got a pulse.

01:18:36.895 --> 01:18:39.085
We've got a rhythm!

01:18:39.465 --> 01:18:41.737
Alright. Let's get another bag here.

01:18:41.817 --> 01:18:44.316
What's our ETA?

01:19:07.292 --> 01:19:09.591
We're losing him!

01:19:11.596 --> 01:19:14.063
Guy's in shock. Clear!

01:19:15.305 --> 01:19:21.431
