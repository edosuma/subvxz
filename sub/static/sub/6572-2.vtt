00:02.602 --> 00:04.661
<i>Previously on</i> Arrested Development.

00:04.771 --> 00:07.830
<i>Michael and his son were
camping out at the family cabin...</i>

00:07.941 --> 00:11.843
<i>- before it was to be relocated.</i>
- I'm just in the middle of a stupid girl problem.

00:11.945 --> 00:15.005
I don't even have a girl,
much less a stupid one.

00:15.115 --> 00:17.345
No, the problem is stupid.
The girl isn't stupid.

00:17.450 --> 00:19.918
<i>But if they ever had a child, it would be...</i>

00:20.020 --> 00:21.783
<i>because the girl
was his cousin Maeby.</i>

00:21.888 --> 00:24.914
Tomorrow morning, before we tell
the cops that that's not Pop-Pop in prison...

00:25.025 --> 00:27.220
we're gonna go down
to the lake, we're gonna discuss...

00:27.327 --> 00:29.295
your girl problem man-to-man,
and it's gonna be fun.

00:29.396 --> 00:31.296
Especially the part about the cops.

00:31.398 --> 00:33.923
<i>But Pop-Pop had other plans...</i>

00:35.568 --> 00:39.561
<i>and Michael awoke to find
his camping trip going south.</i>

00:39.672 --> 00:42.197
Well, you better get up now
if you want to see the lake.

00:44.177 --> 00:47.112
<i>And that was when George Sr.
Made a desperate plea.</i>

00:47.213 --> 00:49.704
Promise me you won't
send me back to prison...

00:49.816 --> 00:53.252
so I can be with my dear love Lucille...

00:53.353 --> 00:55.253
in the twilight of her face.

00:55.355 --> 00:58.153
<i>Michael didn't send his father back to prison...</i>

00:58.258 --> 01:01.716
<i>but instead arranged for him
to be placed under house arrest.</i>

01:01.828 --> 01:03.887
George, we're never going to be...

01:03.997 --> 01:05.897
out of each other's sight.

01:05.999 --> 01:08.229
<i>Which made this woman his warden.</i>

01:08.334 --> 01:11.997
Oh, dear God.
Send me back to prison.

01:12.105 --> 01:14.164
- You gotta send me back to prison.
- More touching.

01:18.678 --> 01:20.976
<i>Michael went to
his parentsâ€™ penthouse to discuss...</i>

01:21.081 --> 01:23.572
<i>his father's ever-worsening
legal situation.</i>

01:23.683 --> 01:25.583
- Where is everybody?
- How should I know, Michael?

01:25.685 --> 01:28.483
As soon as Father came back,
I've been like the Invisible Man.

01:28.588 --> 01:31.523
"Hello! Can anyone see me?"

01:31.624 --> 01:34.491
- Where's your hand, anyway?
- Why even bother getting dressed up?

01:34.594 --> 01:37.586
- I have no one.
- Buster, come on now.

01:37.697 --> 01:39.597
If you're really lonely, maybe
it's time you went out there...

01:39.699 --> 01:42.327
and you got yourself
a girlf... A pet.

01:42.435 --> 01:44.926
- How about a turtle?
- Great.

01:45.038 --> 01:47.939
I've always loved those
leathery little snappy faces.

01:48.041 --> 01:49.941
You certainly have a type.

01:50.043 --> 01:52.511
Mother, have you seen
my rubber hand?

01:52.612 --> 01:55.445
Oh, it's in the dishwasher. Your father
and I were using it for something.

01:55.548 --> 01:57.448
Oh, for God's sake.

01:57.550 --> 02:01.987
- Can't you keep my hand to yourself?
- Uh, "used it for something"?

02:02.088 --> 02:04.113
He's just jealous that I have
a man back in my life.

02:04.224 --> 02:07.216
And guess what else is back.

02:08.828 --> 02:12.229
- My breakfast?
- My friskiness.

02:12.332 --> 02:16.496
-  Mama horny, Michael.
- No, it's my breakfast.

02:16.603 --> 02:19.572
I'm amazed Dad hasn't strangled
himself with his belt yet.

02:19.672 --> 02:23.039
Oh, we're into all kinds of freaky stuff.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.203
Why do I eat breakfast before I come here?

02:26.312 --> 02:28.576
What the hell is this?

02:28.681 --> 02:31.081
Well, now that Dad's back,
I'm going to perform...

02:31.184 --> 02:34.813
one grand illusion for him
before he strangles himself with his belt.

02:34.921 --> 02:37.321
- No, no. Turns out they're into that.
- Oh.

02:37.423 --> 02:40.256
Well, check it.
The illusion is called "Free Bird."

02:40.360 --> 02:44.319
A magical bird... me in a beak...
stands on a platform.

02:44.430 --> 02:46.762
There's a puff of smoke, then I'm gone.

02:46.866 --> 02:50.063
Then seconds later, high above
in a once-empty cage...

02:50.170 --> 02:52.695
- Who should appear?
- A guy that kind of looks like you?

02:52.805 --> 02:55.330
No. Not how I do the trick.

02:55.441 --> 02:58.740
Even if it was, how'd
the look-alike get up there?

02:58.845 --> 03:01.040
- He was hiding behind this mirror here?
- No!

03:01.147 --> 03:03.377
For your information,
Dad asked me to do this...

03:03.483 --> 03:05.383
on the day he pleads not guilty...

03:05.485 --> 03:07.612
as a spectacular protest.

03:07.720 --> 03:09.950
A "protest-acular."

03:10.056 --> 03:12.354
Maybe even get it
on the local news.

03:12.458 --> 03:15.188
Excuse me. I was just
looking for a marker...

03:15.295 --> 03:18.526
A Magic Marker.

03:18.631 --> 03:21.464
I want it out of my living room.
Put it in Buster's room.

03:21.568 --> 03:24.162
That's where she keeps things
she has no need for.

03:24.270 --> 03:26.431
Oh, God.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.939
I'm gonna run this through again
on "Pots and Pans."

03:29.042 --> 03:32.739
You know, Gob, instead of trying to impress
a father that couldn't care less about you...

03:32.845 --> 03:34.745
why don't you try spending
some time with your son...

03:34.847 --> 03:37.145
who's dying to reconnect with you?

03:37.250 --> 03:39.582
<i>Gob had discovered
he was the father of this boy.</i>

03:39.686 --> 03:43.247
- Well, then just tell him that Steve Holt stopped by, okay?
- Okay.

03:43.356 --> 03:45.256
<i>He'd been ducking him ever since.</i>

03:45.358 --> 03:48.725
Tom? Come on over here.
I've got a vitamin for you.

03:48.828 --> 03:51.319
- He's the one who can't see me.
- Because you were hiding in the trick?

03:51.431 --> 03:54.992
Illusion, Michael.

03:55.101 --> 03:57.069
I so very much would like to be...

03:57.170 --> 03:59.070
in your "prostate-icular"...

03:59.172 --> 04:01.970
- as your look-alike.
- Right.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.066
They're gonna see the ink.
It's more of a leading man role.

04:04.177 --> 04:06.611
But it's not really done that way.

04:06.713 --> 04:11.173
Guess I shouldn't have
used a permanent marker.

04:12.352 --> 04:14.479
Starting to see why
you want that divorce.

04:14.587 --> 04:16.918
Yeah, well, actually,
I've been thinking.

04:17.023 --> 04:18.923
Instead of spending money
on a divorce...

04:19.024 --> 04:22.654
which can be slow...
well, maybe I should get something faster.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.753
Not the car.
I said no to the Volvo.

04:24.864 --> 04:27.856
The Lexus. The Volvo didn't have
satellite radio, which is crazy.

04:27.967 --> 04:29.867
I mean, what are we, Amish?

04:29.969 --> 04:31.834
I knew you wouldn't have the guts
to go through with the divorce.

04:31.938 --> 04:34.600
You're one to talk. You haven't had
a serious relationship since your wife.

04:34.707 --> 04:38.438
And... you guys weren't even
speaking toward the end.

04:38.544 --> 04:41.843
- Lot of that was the coma.
- Yeah. I've heard your side of it.

04:41.948 --> 04:44.940
You haven't had the guts to meet someone else.

04:45.051 --> 04:48.851
- Uh...
- Look who finally got his pants on.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.855
You've got 10 minutes.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.925
You gotta get me out of here.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.119
You're the one that said no to prison.

04:55.228 --> 04:58.061
I was wrong. There you just had
to shut your eyes and take it.

04:58.164 --> 05:01.224
Here you have to shut your eyes
and give it. Now listen.

05:01.334 --> 05:03.234
We can't just go in there
and plead not guilty.

05:03.336 --> 05:06.237
We have to have someone big
behind us. Our own private Matlock.

05:06.339 --> 05:08.204
So I made some calls, and I got him.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.469
- Got who?
- Andy Griffith.

05:10.576 --> 05:12.874
- What, you never saw Matlock?
- Not a real attorney, Dad.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.047
Now, for 10 grand, he'll actually...

05:16.149 --> 05:18.709
sit behind us in court
and read the paper.

05:18.818 --> 05:21.912
For 15, he'll actually sit
at the defense table.

05:22.021 --> 05:24.649
For $20,000, he'll twice...

05:24.757 --> 05:28.989
lean forward
and whisper something in your ear.

05:29.095 --> 05:31.154
Oh. White suit...
That's extra.

05:31.264 --> 05:34.700
Well, that's an awful lot of money
for the stupidest idea I've ever heard.

05:34.801 --> 05:37.326
- The juries love him.
- That's just it, Dad.

05:37.437 --> 05:40.736
There won't be a jury
because we are pleading guilty.

05:40.840 --> 05:44.207
I am not guilt...
I didn't want to tell you this.

05:44.310 --> 05:47.404
- Ready for the bombshell?
- Andy Griffith wasn't the bombshell?

05:47.513 --> 05:51.074
I'm a patsy.
I was set up... by the Brits.

05:51.184 --> 05:54.585
A group of British builders
operating outside the OC...

05:54.687 --> 05:56.587
- Don't call it that.
- Contacted me...

05:56.689 --> 05:59.055
for a partnership
to build homes overseas.

05:59.158 --> 06:01.854
I did not know they meant Iraq.

06:01.961 --> 06:03.758
We've got a picture of you
with Saddam Hussein.

06:03.863 --> 06:06.889
I thought that was the guy
who played the Soup Nazi.

06:06.999 --> 06:09.559
- Come on.
- I told him how much I liked his work.

06:09.669 --> 06:12.365
The Brits used that picture
to blackmail me.

06:12.472 --> 06:15.134
A picture like that, Michael,
can end your career.

06:15.241 --> 06:17.801
Not in every case.

06:17.910 --> 06:19.901
These are dangerous people, Michael.
They'll do whatever it takes...

06:20.012 --> 06:22.537
to get inside this family
and just bring us down.

06:22.648 --> 06:26.550
- British people.
- Oh, they're polite and the men all sound gay...

06:26.652 --> 06:29.212
but they will rip out
your heart and...

06:29.322 --> 06:32.291
- Their breath...
- And you want to go after these people?

06:32.392 --> 06:34.724
Well, yes, it takes
a little courage, Michael.

06:34.827 --> 06:36.727
I know that's not
your strongest suit.

06:36.829 --> 06:40.230
You're... You're even scared
to ask a girl out on a date.

06:40.333 --> 06:43.166
Wh... Why does everybody
think that I'm scared of girls?

06:43.269 --> 06:44.998
- Because you're a chicken. You're a chicken.
- No, I'm not.

06:48.104 --> 06:50.064
What are you doing?

06:50.176 --> 06:52.235
Michael and women?

06:52.345 --> 06:54.939
That's what I was just telling him.

06:55.047 --> 06:56.947
Look, I haven't found the right girl.

06:57.049 --> 06:58.949
When I do, I will ask her out.

06:59.051 --> 07:01.781
Has anyone in this family
ever even seen a chicken?

07:01.888 --> 07:04.015
Wait, wait. I've got the perfect thing!

07:04.123 --> 07:06.751
That's enough.
I will give it one day.

07:06.859 --> 07:09.350
All right? I'll see if there's any
evidence of these nefarious Brits.

07:09.462 --> 07:12.488
But I'm warning you...
If I can't, we're pleading guilty.

07:12.598 --> 07:15.863
You're either going to jail, of if the judge
shows absolutely no mercy at all...

07:15.968 --> 07:18.198
you'll be staying here with my mother.

07:18.304 --> 07:20.864
Lindsay, I didn't want to tell you earlier,
but I did get you a car.

07:20.973 --> 07:23.601
- Is it the Lexus?
- It's more like a Lincoln.

07:32.151 --> 07:34.119
Oh, come on!

07:34.220 --> 07:37.053
There's no satellite radio,
but there's a banjo in the closet.

07:37.156 --> 07:39.317
And watch out for live-ins.

07:39.425 --> 07:42.019
You will get some live-ins.

07:49.602 --> 07:51.832
<i>Michael was investigating his father's case...</i>

07:51.938 --> 07:55.032
<i>in the English section
of Orange County.</i>

07:55.141 --> 07:57.041
Lanes reverse!

07:57.143 --> 07:59.737
You're driving on the wrong side,
you bloomin' idiot!

07:59.846 --> 08:01.677
I need to check the records...

08:01.781 --> 08:03.646
for any British-owned
building businesses...

08:03.749 --> 08:06.309
that would have applied for license
about 10 years ago.

08:06.419 --> 08:10.685
Oh, I'm so sorry. You need
a U.K. Passport to check those files.

08:10.790 --> 08:13.588
They're for British eyes only.

08:15.695 --> 08:17.526
Don't I look kind of British?

08:17.630 --> 08:19.655
Perhaps if you're willing
to lose 20 pounds.

08:19.765 --> 08:21.665
<i>The clerk was asking for a bribe...</i>

08:21.767 --> 08:25.533
<i>- but this was lost on Michael.</i>
- You guys do go for the jugular.

08:25.638 --> 08:28.038
If you find someone with a passport,
we're here till 8:00...

08:28.140 --> 08:30.665
and do stay for the Poppins.

08:30.776 --> 08:32.676
<i>So Michael went to the local pub...</i>

08:32.778 --> 08:35.042
- Bloody Yank!
<i>- to see if he could find someone...</i>

08:35.147 --> 08:37.741
<i>- with a British passport.</i>
- Welcome to the Yellow Fang.

08:37.850 --> 08:40.284
I am Lionel, and the soup of the day is...

08:40.385 --> 08:42.581
What's the soup of the day, Mum?

08:42.688 --> 08:46.021
- Bread.
- And the soup of the day is bread...

08:46.125 --> 08:48.093
Unless youâ€™re just here for the Poppins.

08:48.194 --> 08:51.857
<i>And that's when Michael saw
the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen.</i>

08:51.964 --> 08:53.898
<i>Not her.</i>

08:54.000 --> 08:55.900
<i>Wait for it.</i>

09:02.141 --> 09:04.132
Are you from Wee Britain?

09:04.243 --> 09:06.211
Great Britain, actually.

09:06.312 --> 09:09.247
I was wondering if you might
be willing to go somewhere with me.

09:09.348 --> 09:13.216
- I will pay you.
- You'll pay me?

09:13.319 --> 09:17.016
Not... Not for sex. You're gonna think
that I'm Jack the Ripper, right?

09:17.123 --> 09:20.490
- Didn't he kill prostitutes or...
- I'm not a prostitute.

09:20.593 --> 09:23.460
Then I shall let you live.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.726
This is my worst hello.
Let me try again.

09:26.832 --> 09:29.232
- My name is Michael.
- Rita.

09:29.335 --> 09:31.235
So I need access to these files...

09:31.337 --> 09:33.532
that are apparently
for British eyes only.

09:33.639 --> 09:38.303
Well, lucky for you,
my whole face is British.

09:41.280 --> 09:44.078
It's just across the street.
I really appreciate... Hello.

09:44.183 --> 09:46.481
- I thought you said you were open till 8:00.
- Oh, yes... GMT.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.487
Everything here is on Greenwich mean time.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.183
What a curious street.

09:52.291 --> 09:56.193
Uh... Wait, wait, Rita. I don't suppose
that you're here tomorrow morning?

09:56.295 --> 09:59.287
Oh, no. Not in the morning, no.
I'll be back at Slowbrooke.

09:59.398 --> 10:02.299
Slowbrooke... The private school.
You teach kids, huh?

10:02.401 --> 10:04.460
I like to think they teach me.

10:04.570 --> 10:07.130
- Like what? How to eat crayons, throw tantrums...
- Oh, no.

10:07.239 --> 10:10.037
Not when I'm there.
I'm very good.

10:10.142 --> 10:14.135
I didn't mean to impugn
your ability or, uh...

10:14.246 --> 10:16.646
It's turning into one of my worst good-byes.

10:16.749 --> 10:19.047
Farewell, and, uh...

10:19.151 --> 10:21.779
our paths shan't cross again.

10:21.887 --> 10:24.287
As you like it.

10:24.390 --> 10:26.153
<i>Michael would have walked away forever...</i>

10:26.258 --> 10:28.123
<i>but he was struck by
something he remembered...</i>

10:28.227 --> 10:30.821
<i>- from his childhood.</i>
- You know...

10:30.930 --> 10:33.728
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
it's the flight of the Mary Poppins.</i>

10:33.833 --> 10:36.996
<i>- Mary Poppins will take...</i>
- Well, must be the Poppins.

10:37.103 --> 10:40.197
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's wrong to laugh.

10:40.306 --> 10:43.707
No, no, it was good. I liked it.
I was just gonna ask you...

10:43.809 --> 10:45.709
Pre-schools just go half day, right?

10:45.811 --> 10:48.780
I'm not trying to pick you up, but
is there any way that I can come by...

10:48.881 --> 10:51.645
- pick you up, bring you here?
- Yeah, l... I, uh...

10:51.751 --> 10:55.312
I suppose I could sneak out at nap time.

10:55.421 --> 10:57.321
- Yes? Perfect. Great.
- Mmm.

10:57.423 --> 10:59.653
And I shall drop you
off alive, hooker or no.

11:02.361 --> 11:04.761
<i>Tobias, still hoping to be in Gob's trick...</i>

11:04.864 --> 11:09.597
<i>- ventured into a costume shop he'd stumbled upon...</i>
- Oh, look who's back.

11:09.702 --> 11:13.035
<i>- years earlier.</i>
- Are you gonna buy this time, or you just curious?

11:13.139 --> 11:15.767
I suppose I'm, uh, buy-curious.

11:15.875 --> 11:17.843
I have a big TV opportunity.

11:17.943 --> 11:20.070
This is where all the big TVs come.

11:20.179 --> 11:23.945
- Uh, let's start with the Eve Arden.
- All right.

11:24.050 --> 11:25.950
<i>Michael, meanwhile, called his sister.</i>

11:26.052 --> 11:29.215
I wanted to tell you that I got myself
a date with a beautiful woman...

11:29.321 --> 11:32.757
named Rita, and you're the chicken, not me.

11:32.858 --> 11:35.190
Cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck...

11:35.294 --> 11:39.060
Okay. That's a pretty good chicken.

11:50.409 --> 11:52.309
Watch out!

11:52.411 --> 11:55.073
Crazy Brit!

11:55.181 --> 11:57.274
What's the problem?

11:57.383 --> 11:59.283
I know what you were
doing back there.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.285
And if you've got half
a !@%$# brain...

12:01.387 --> 12:04.550
- you'll leave it alone.
- You talking about back in Wee Britain?

12:04.657 --> 12:06.557
- I was just asking a few questions.
- Yeah...

12:06.659 --> 12:08.559
A few too many, if you ask me.

12:08.661 --> 12:11.221
How would you like someone going
after some stupid person in your family?

12:11.330 --> 12:14.094
Now, back off, you !@%$# ponce!

12:16.268 --> 12:18.463
Wow.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.131
Dad was not kidding
about their breath.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.244
<i>Michael had just been threatened...</i>

12:26.345 --> 12:28.779
<i>by a foul-mouthed British man.</i>

12:28.881 --> 12:30.781
It's Michael. I'm not dressed.

12:30.883 --> 12:33.249
Gob, this is Michael.

12:33.352 --> 12:35.513
Shouldn't you be getting ready
for your "Free Bird" trick?

12:35.621 --> 12:37.589
- I couldn't get the rights to "Free Bird."
- Oh.

12:37.690 --> 12:40.318
I'm thinking about calling it "Free..."
I don't know. "Chicken."

12:40.426 --> 12:43.259
I thought you were investigating Dad's
sinister British connection.

12:43.362 --> 12:45.262
Yeah. I, uh, tried, but, uh...

12:45.364 --> 12:47.264
when I was leaving...

12:47.366 --> 12:50.494
one of those British guys
came after me and told me to back off.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.696
Can't believe it, but Dad
may have been telling the truth.

12:52.805 --> 12:55.603
- This might be dangerous.
- So you came back here to hide like a child.

12:55.708 --> 12:59.439
- What are you doing locked in my office, exactly?
- Hiding from a child.

12:59.545 --> 13:01.604
- Big difference.
- Gob, Steve Holt is your son.

13:01.714 --> 13:04.274
- He probably just feels a connection.
- He doesn't know what he feels.

13:04.383 --> 13:06.283
I'm tried of being told.

13:07.820 --> 13:10.618
My God.
What is this feeling?

13:10.723 --> 13:12.691
You know, the feeling that you're...

13:12.792 --> 13:15.852
that you're feeling, it's just
what many of us call a feeling.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.861
It's not like envy...

13:17.963 --> 13:20.864
- Or even hungry.
- Could it be love?

13:20.966 --> 13:24.163
I know what an erection feels like, Michael.
No. It's the opposite.

13:24.270 --> 13:26.465
It's like my heart is getting hard.

13:27.506 --> 13:30.202
Maybe I am ready to be a father.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.368
- Hey, Dad?
- Whoa!

13:32.478 --> 13:34.469
It's my son, Gob.

13:34.580 --> 13:38.175
You know, and what is it with the fathers
in this family always trying to deceive their...

13:38.284 --> 13:40.650
<i>And that's when
Michael realized that the man...</i>

13:40.753 --> 13:43.278
<i>who threatened him
must have been hired by George Sr.</i>

13:43.389 --> 13:45.357
I'm the patsy.

13:46.692 --> 13:48.626
Well, I gotta go.
George Michael?

13:48.727 --> 13:51.594
I'm sorry, but we're gonna talk
about that girl later, okay?

13:51.697 --> 13:53.597
Now all I have to do
is find that look-alike, Michael.

13:53.699 --> 13:55.599
Michael?

13:57.136 --> 13:59.400
Hey!

14:00.439 --> 14:02.669
That's a woman's wig.

14:02.775 --> 14:04.675
I was told it was a bob.

14:07.112 --> 14:09.774
<i>- And Michael confronted his father.</i>
- Find out anything?

14:09.882 --> 14:11.782
Yeah, I found out no matter
how many times I promise myself...

14:11.884 --> 14:13.784
I'm not gonna fall for it,
I always end up...

14:13.886 --> 14:15.911
- getting hustled by you.
- What are you talking about?

14:16.021 --> 14:18.785
The guy that you hired to threaten me
after I looked into the British connection.

14:18.891 --> 14:20.756
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Somebody threatened you?

14:20.860 --> 14:22.885
It's a wonderful performance.
You're a regular Brad Garrett.

14:22.995 --> 14:24.860
But I don't watch TV
at 3:00 in the afternoon...

14:24.964 --> 14:26.693
and you can forget
about pleading not guilty.

14:26.799 --> 14:29.359
- Guilty. We gotta plead guilty.
- What?

14:29.468 --> 14:31.800
Michael, I didn't hire anyone,
I... I swear.

14:31.904 --> 14:34.771
If someone came after you,
they're for real.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.775
- Come on. You serious?
- I told you. These are bad guys.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.107
They do not want
this information out.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.373
He said he was gonna come
after somebody stupid in our family.

14:42.481 --> 14:45.473
- That could be Buster.
- Could be Gob.

14:45.584 --> 14:48.451
- You're not guilty.
- We have to plead guilty.

14:48.554 --> 14:51.387
- We gotta plead guilty.
- We gotta throw ourselves on the mercy of the court.

14:51.490 --> 14:54.755
- We gotta get Andy Griffith.
- In the suit.

14:54.860 --> 14:56.885
<i>And Michael went to cancel with Rita.</i>

14:56.996 --> 14:59.430
Sorry. I just wanted
to let you know...

14:59.531 --> 15:01.965
that I'm not gonna be needing
your passport after all.

15:02.067 --> 15:04.399
We're just gonna go to court, plead guilty.
That'll be that.

15:04.503 --> 15:08.132
- So it's bye-bye to Rita, then?
- Yes, I'll shake your hand good-bye...

15:08.240 --> 15:11.801
but, actually, I was wondering
if you might want to...

15:11.911 --> 15:15.142
I wouldn't. I'll make you blue.

15:15.247 --> 15:18.182
<i>Rita was just talking about the finger paint...</i>

15:18.284 --> 15:20.514
<i>- but Michael didn't know that.</i>
- I was just wondering...

15:20.619 --> 15:24.453
if you might want to bid me fair morrow.

15:24.556 --> 15:28.253
<i>Michael was filled with self-loathing.</i>

15:28.360 --> 15:32.456
<i>Had he been Jack the Ripper,
he would have soothed himself...</i>

15:32.564 --> 15:35.032
<i>in a most unsavory way.</i>

15:35.134 --> 15:37.193
<i>But instead he just
sat in his car...</i>

15:37.303 --> 15:40.500
<i>and ate a whole thing
of candy beans.</i>

15:40.606 --> 15:44.235
<i>And back at the penthouse,
Gob had been called to see his father.</i>

15:44.343 --> 15:46.243
New plan, right?

15:46.345 --> 15:49.337
<i>You put me in the trick.
You make me the guy in the cage.</i>

15:49.448 --> 15:51.507
Okay, I just gotta say
I'm really blown away by this.

15:51.617 --> 15:54.848
You really want to be part of my world.

15:54.954 --> 15:59.448
- I do.
- God, I feel like my heart is straining through my shirt.

15:59.558 --> 16:01.719
They take the ankle monitor off
when I get to court.

16:01.827 --> 16:04.694
So, you make me disappear,
you put Tobias in the cage...

16:04.797 --> 16:07.698
and by the time they realize
that that guy is not me...

16:07.800 --> 16:10.394
I'm running through
the storm drains to freedom.

16:10.502 --> 16:12.993
Where every day it rains...

16:13.105 --> 16:15.539
pennies from heaven!

16:20.145 --> 16:22.375
It was a... bird day...

16:22.481 --> 16:25.382
Gob, I know you're looking
for a twin for your illusion...

16:25.484 --> 16:28.317
and there's somebody
I'd like to put in a plug for.

16:28.420 --> 16:32.379
Uh... Correction.
Make that 4,000 plugs.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.220
- Oh, God!
- Oh, come on.

16:34.326 --> 16:35.725
Mr. Gay, he's bleeding.
Mr. Gay...

16:35.828 --> 16:38.388
No, no, no, no...
I was scared too...

16:38.497 --> 16:41.489
but I realized it was
of being a leading man.

16:41.600 --> 16:45.195
Oh, I can just taste those meaty
leading-man parts in my mouth.

16:45.304 --> 16:48.273
All right, listen to me. The trick
has changed. We want you to play me now.

16:48.374 --> 16:51.775
Oh, but that would mean
I'd have to sh...

16:51.877 --> 16:54.573
Shave my very...
tender head. I see.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.376
Okay. Well, perhaps
I jumped the gun...

16:57.483 --> 16:59.383
on those new head shots.

17:01.353 --> 17:03.844
<i>And later that day,
Michael arrived at the courthouse.</i>

17:03.956 --> 17:05.981
I can't believe you're
just giving up like this.

17:06.090 --> 17:08.059
Well, the guy threatened our family.
We have to plead guilty.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.127
No, I'm talking about that girl
you said you have a date with.

17:10.229 --> 17:12.196
All right, so I lied.
It wasn't a date.

17:12.297 --> 17:14.196
But you could have
made one with her.

17:14.299 --> 17:16.460
I think that Poppins knocked
the courage out of you.

17:16.568 --> 17:18.468
I guess I'm just not in her league.

17:18.569 --> 17:20.560
- How did you hear about the Poppins?
- It was on the news.

17:20.672 --> 17:23.698
An unlicensed Mary Poppins
takes down another tourist.

17:23.809 --> 17:28.371
Is this the work of the Itsy Bitsy IRA?

17:28.480 --> 17:30.380
I don't want to talk about this.

17:30.482 --> 17:32.541
Dad, we're gonna go in there,
Andy Griffith's gonna whisper something.

17:32.651 --> 17:34.551
We're gonna plead guilty.
Nice and simple.

17:34.653 --> 17:37.121
- You didn't hear. We lost Andy.
- What are you talking about?

17:37.222 --> 17:40.214
- He didn't like his trailer.
- He thought we were making fun of him.

17:40.325 --> 17:42.486
<i>No one was making fun of Andy Griffith.</i>

17:42.594 --> 17:44.562
<i>I can't emphasize that enough.</i>

17:46.732 --> 17:48.632
Oh, God. Don't look now...

17:48.734 --> 17:50.634
but Gob's doing his magic show.

17:50.736 --> 17:53.762
Oh, boy, a stupid magic show.
We gotta watch this.

17:53.872 --> 17:57.968
- A big turnout.
- A lot of people are probably here for the free chicken.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.977
Gather round, humans...

18:00.079 --> 18:01.979
and I will show you the plight...

18:02.081 --> 18:04.015
of an innocent man
who yearns to be...

18:04.116 --> 18:07.313
free as a bird!

18:07.419 --> 18:10.820
I've gotta start labeling these suits.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.687
Who shall I send on this journey...

18:13.792 --> 18:16.283
to that dangling cage?

18:16.395 --> 18:20.331
Oh, pick me. Look, could I be
in this stupid trick?

18:20.432 --> 18:22.491
- Please?
- Steve Holt, what are you doing here?

18:22.601 --> 18:24.967
I just came to see the magic show.

18:25.070 --> 18:26.970
I didn't know it was you.

18:27.072 --> 18:30.200
- Do you like magic?
- No.

18:30.309 --> 18:32.675
- I love it.
<i>-  And at that moment...</i>

18:32.778 --> 18:36.009
<i>Gob chose to show his own son
what he was capable of.</i>

18:36.115 --> 18:38.379
I've decided I will be
performing the feat...

18:38.484 --> 18:40.384
myself.

18:40.486 --> 18:44.320
<i>- Wait. We're back to hair?</i>
-  Fortunately for Tobias, however...

18:44.423 --> 18:48.519
<i>- he'd found it too painful
to part with his new hair.</i>

18:48.627 --> 18:53.030
- Boy. Did I catch a break.
<i>- So he opted to wear a bald cap.</i>

18:53.132 --> 18:55.123
This chicken...

18:55.234 --> 18:57.862
shall be wrongly cooped.

19:02.307 --> 19:04.707
-  Is that a chicken?
-  Oh, my God.

19:04.810 --> 19:08.007
- Dad, are you all right?
- I fooled his own son.

19:08.113 --> 19:11.708
I am a leading man.

19:11.817 --> 19:14.012
<i>And Gob himself
was running through the storm drains...</i>

19:14.119 --> 19:16.212
I'm sorry, Steve.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.152
<i>- free as a chicken.</i>
- I need to be a father.

19:19.257 --> 19:22.193
<i>And George Sr. needed to escape too.</i>

19:22.294 --> 19:24.694
I got him.

19:26.698 --> 19:28.598
Keeps him out of the kitchen.

19:28.700 --> 19:31.601
<i>And Michael,
seeing what a life of cowardice leads to...</i>

19:31.703 --> 19:33.830
<i>decided he'd had enough of it.</i>

19:33.939 --> 19:36.737
<i>And soon George Sr. came to,
and it was time...</i>

19:36.842 --> 19:38.742
<i>- to render a plea.</i>
- Oh, no.

19:38.844 --> 19:41.074
Prosecution's got that stud from L.A. Law.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.047
-  It's Harry Hamlin.
- I love my trailer.

19:44.149 --> 19:46.242
In the matter of The People v. Bluth...

19:46.351 --> 19:50.754
- how do you plead?
- We plead... not guilty.

19:50.790 --> 19:53.016
Order in the court!

19:53.125 --> 19:55.025
- Who let a flashbulb camera in?
- What are you doing?

19:55.127 --> 19:58.187
I'm tired of the cowardice. You're not guilty.
We're gonna fight this.

19:58.297 --> 20:00.561
They don't have a !@%$# prayer.

20:00.666 --> 20:04.033
Send the check to my accountant.

20:04.136 --> 20:07.731
- This is where Andy could have helped us.
-  I'm proud of you.

20:07.839 --> 20:09.739
It's about time I showed a little courage.

20:09.841 --> 20:11.775
I just hope those Brits
aren't as dangerous as Dad said.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.777
Well, they're not gonna
get any closer to us.

20:13.879 --> 20:17.110
If they do, we're gonna see them coming.
Oh, my God. That's Rita.

20:17.216 --> 20:20.617
I told her I was coming here and she came.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.448
- That's Rita?
- Yeah.

20:24.389 --> 20:27.790
Wow. She is way out of his league.

20:27.893 --> 20:30.623
I'm glad you're here.

20:30.729 --> 20:33.323
I wanna call you sometime
and take you out.

20:33.432 --> 20:35.400
Oh.
