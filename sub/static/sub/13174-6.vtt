WEBVTT

00:01.039 --> 00:02.540
Previously on "Wrecked"...

00:02.565 --> 00:04.833
I can't stay in the same
place with the same people...

00:04.858 --> 00:05.793
I'm gonna chart the island.

00:05.818 --> 00:07.277
Great idea. I'll come with.

00:07.302 --> 00:08.968
I think I'm gonna go
by myself on this one.

00:08.993 --> 00:10.644
I think we need an election.

00:10.669 --> 00:12.403
The new leader of the island is...

00:12.428 --> 00:13.489
Steve!

00:13.514 --> 00:14.956
Really?!

00:14.981 --> 00:16.471
Todd stole the camp's stuff.

00:16.496 --> 00:17.727
What if we dug a giant pit?

00:17.752 --> 00:18.608
We can throw Todd in there

00:18.633 --> 00:19.878
until he gives us all of our stuff back.

00:19.903 --> 00:20.931
Throw him in the pit!

00:22.374 --> 00:23.886
Oh, God!

00:23.911 --> 00:25.791
All the hard work you've been doing

00:25.815 --> 00:28.037
for all these years is gone.

00:29.776 --> 00:31.252
Pack, the beach is that way!

00:31.277 --> 00:32.442
Hello!

00:32.468 --> 00:34.240
Anybody!

00:38.096 --> 00:41.361
I gave you your stupid stuff back!

00:41.386 --> 00:45.288
Now get me out of here,
you goddamn animals!

00:46.802 --> 00:48.704
What happens if it rains?!

00:48.729 --> 00:50.662
I'll drown!

00:51.562 --> 00:54.248
Or maybe I can swim my way out.

00:54.443 --> 00:57.399
Oh, yeah. Come on, rain.

00:57.424 --> 00:59.062
Come on, rain!

00:59.087 --> 01:00.994
Hey, Todd. I got your food.

01:01.019 --> 01:03.289
Come on. Hey, Chumba!

01:03.314 --> 01:05.942
Chumba, man, hey, listen,
you got to get me out of here.

01:05.966 --> 01:07.298
There's, uh

01:07.324 --> 01:08.700
There's something down here.

01:08.725 --> 01:10.230
- What is it?
- I don't know.

01:10.255 --> 01:12.909
I don't know, Chumba, but it's weird.

01:12.934 --> 01:13.800
It's so weird.

01:13.825 --> 01:16.261
Here, come down here so
you can see for yourself.

01:16.286 --> 01:17.634
Is your plan to get me down there

01:17.659 --> 01:19.125
so you can hold me hostage?

01:20.903 --> 01:22.668
- No.
- I'm not going down there, Todd.

01:22.693 --> 01:25.477
you, Chumba! You rat!

01:25.502 --> 01:27.783
I'll rip your heart out. Oh, God!

01:27.808 --> 01:28.595
Here's your food.

01:28.620 --> 01:29.490
No.

01:29.515 --> 01:32.123
- Goodbye, Todd.
- No! No, Chumba!

01:32.148 --> 01:34.656
Hey, hey! Chumba, wait!

01:34.681 --> 01:36.447
I thought we were bros, dude!

01:36.472 --> 01:38.233
Oh, Chumba, let me out of here!

01:38.258 --> 01:40.386
Oh, Chumba!

Dad?

01:47.527 --> 01:50.589
Hey, there he is! Big O!

01:50.717 --> 01:53.054
Oh, shit!

01:53.079 --> 01:54.910
Was that today?

01:54.934 --> 01:57.845
- I'm sorry, dude, I had this...
- Where are you going?

01:57.870 --> 01:59.335
Well, uh...

01:59.360 --> 02:00.919
I got to jet off for a while.

02:00.945 --> 02:01.813
Why?

02:01.838 --> 02:04.505
Well, your mom and me,
we're having some issues.

02:04.530 --> 02:07.290
Let me see if I can explain it
in terms you can understand.

02:07.536 --> 02:10.461
Sometimes in the, uh, pageant of love,

02:10.485 --> 02:12.884
there can be more than one winner,

02:12.909 --> 02:16.107
like your mom and her friend Linda

02:16.132 --> 02:18.307
and sometimes Linda's sister, Stacey.

02:18.332 --> 02:21.787
The point is, your mom doesn't
want to share the crown.

02:21.812 --> 02:23.475
So I got to move out.

02:23.501 --> 02:25.851
Are you coming back?

02:25.876 --> 02:28.355
Owen, can I give you a
little bit of advice?

02:28.380 --> 02:31.187
Don't ever stay in one
place for too long.

02:31.212 --> 02:32.748
You just end up getting hurt.

02:32.773 --> 02:35.931
It's best to just...
fsht! Keep on moving.

02:35.957 --> 02:38.624
Moving is living.

02:38.812 --> 02:40.768
That and crank one out once a day.

02:40.793 --> 02:42.616
Keeps you loose, sharp.

02:42.641 --> 02:44.564
You got that, buddy?

02:44.997 --> 02:48.220
Moving is living.

02:50.954 --> 02:53.154
And don't forget to crank one out!

03:07.489 --> 03:09.099
Oh.

03:24.598 --> 03:25.946
Hello, everyone.

03:25.971 --> 03:28.762
Welcome to the third
island meeting under me,

03:28.787 --> 03:30.426
your new prime mini-Steve.

03:33.118 --> 03:35.074
All right, well, lots to discuss today.

03:35.099 --> 03:36.837
But first up, some exciting news.

03:36.862 --> 03:39.151
Nigel, quite a good rummager,

03:39.176 --> 03:41.806
going through the wreckage,
found a flare gun.

03:41.831 --> 03:43.910
- Yeah!
- Kudos to you, Nigel.

03:43.935 --> 03:45.182
It'll come in handy.

03:45.357 --> 03:48.729
Now, today,
I'd like to discuss new shelters.

03:48.754 --> 03:50.362
I think it's about time
we started building

03:50.387 --> 03:51.878
- more permanent structures.
- Look!

03:51.959 --> 03:54.426
Owen's back! And I think
he's got something!

03:54.451 --> 03:56.106
Oh, wait, guys! Hang on.

03:56.131 --> 03:58.563
I haven't finished talking
about the structures and...

03:58.587 --> 04:00.401
footpaths.

04:01.266 --> 04:05.641
Hey. I found this on the
other side of the island.

04:05.666 --> 04:06.730
- Nice!
- Yeah.

04:06.755 --> 04:08.243
What were you doing over there?

04:08.378 --> 04:09.968
What do you mean? I was
just walking around.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.427
I was just... It washed up on the beach.

04:11.456 --> 04:13.443
And I was just walking around.
Why, what, huh?

04:13.468 --> 04:15.899
"Cowboy Pants Truck Time."

04:15.924 --> 04:17.019
Yeah.

04:17.043 --> 04:18.563
That's nice, Owen.

04:18.949 --> 04:20.930
Don't you guys see what this is?

04:20.956 --> 04:23.611
A super-confusing Chinese jeans ad?

04:23.636 --> 04:25.970
Guys, it's a sail.

04:26.093 --> 04:27.556
Yeah?

04:27.581 --> 04:29.275
This is our way home.

04:33.431 --> 04:35.595
So hungry.

04:35.620 --> 04:37.748
I'm so hungry.

04:47.484 --> 04:49.259
Ugh!

04:49.283 --> 04:50.892
Oh!

04:52.756 --> 04:54.663
What the hell?

05:10.455 --> 05:13.012
What happened?

05:19.400 --> 05:21.300
Ooh!

05:21.325 --> 05:22.569
Food!

05:22.839 --> 05:25.427
Food!

05:26.072 --> 05:28.363
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

05:30.540 --> 05:33.435
I'm gonna die here.

05:35.194 --> 05:37.616
With two gross dudes.

05:45.370 --> 05:47.226
Owen, how's the tarp going?

05:47.251 --> 05:51.253
Good. Good. I think, you know,
we just got to build a boat.

05:51.289 --> 05:53.845
I was thinking instead of a boat,

05:53.870 --> 05:56.156
we could use the tarp for shelter.

05:56.651 --> 05:57.940
What?

05:57.965 --> 05:59.873
Shelter, it's... It's just basically...

05:59.898 --> 06:01.741
It means like a covering to keep you...

06:01.766 --> 06:04.330
Yeah, I understand
what shelter is, Steve.

06:04.355 --> 06:06.107
I just...  I don't understand why.

06:06.132 --> 06:07.932
Oh, just 'cause it's
always raining here.

06:07.957 --> 06:10.191
You know, it would be nice to
have somewhere dry to hide,

06:10.216 --> 06:13.304
get some sort of livable space.

06:13.329 --> 06:16.080
Well, how about when you find a tarp,
you can make it livable.

06:16.105 --> 06:18.074
But I found this tarp,
so I'm gonna sail home.

06:18.099 --> 06:18.882
Yeah?

06:21.788 --> 06:25.042
Well, the thing is,
I-I'm kind of in charge now.

06:25.067 --> 06:26.353
So...

06:26.378 --> 06:28.185
Wait, was that not a joke?

06:28.210 --> 06:30.522
When Diane said that they
elected you to be the boss,

06:30.547 --> 06:31.850
I thought that was a big joke.

06:31.875 --> 06:33.237
- Is that real?
- That's real.

06:33.262 --> 06:34.648
It was a landslide victory.

06:34.673 --> 06:36.226
Holy moly!

06:36.620 --> 06:38.587
Whoa! That is hilarious!

06:38.622 --> 06:39.385
Steve!

06:39.410 --> 06:40.841
I had a good laugh, too.

06:40.866 --> 06:42.767
- Yeah.
- I mean, I was, "Me?!"

06:42.792 --> 06:44.060
- You know?
- I know, you?!

06:44.085 --> 06:45.553
- Yeah.
- Not you.

06:45.578 --> 06:48.884
- Yes, turns out, I'm the guy.
- Come on.

06:48.909 --> 06:52.572
So what I'm gonna do is now
just confiscate this from you.

06:54.069 --> 06:55.848
Okay, Steve, how about this, man?

06:55.873 --> 06:58.150
How about we go ahead
and we ask your island

06:58.175 --> 06:59.769
what they want to do with the tarp?

07:00.510 --> 07:03.697
Seriously, nobody else wants
to use the tarp as a sail?

07:03.722 --> 07:05.329
Just us three? Really?

07:05.354 --> 07:07.809
Guys, we have to at
least make an attempt.

07:07.834 --> 07:09.968
Moving is living, right?

07:09.993 --> 07:12.144
Florence, don't you
want to get out of here?

07:12.169 --> 07:15.385
Of course I do,
but sailing into that ocean is suicide.

07:15.410 --> 07:17.338
Besides, now we've got a flare gun.

07:17.363 --> 07:19.129
I mean, we could get rescued here.

07:19.162 --> 07:21.061
That's the ultimate plan, surely!

07:21.508 --> 07:23.998
In the meantime,
we can use the tarp for shelter.

07:24.024 --> 07:26.279
It would be nice to have someplace dry.

07:26.304 --> 07:27.839
You know, more livable.

07:27.864 --> 07:28.955
Oh, my God.

07:28.981 --> 07:32.377
Okay, well, who votes we use the
"Truck Time" tarp for shelter

07:32.402 --> 07:35.170
until we come up with a
better solution for rescuing?

07:35.195 --> 07:36.251
Seriously?

07:36.408 --> 07:37.696
Well, there it is, then.

07:38.993 --> 07:42.548
I might even add quite a landslide.

07:43.994 --> 07:47.574
I hope you all feel real
good about yourselves,

07:48.009 --> 07:50.999
making a grown man go crazy!

07:52.821 --> 07:54.351
Who's there?!

07:58.895 --> 08:00.562
Jess, you okay?

08:00.587 --> 08:02.077
Oh, yeah.

08:02.727 --> 08:06.484
Yeah, I'm fine.
It's just stupid Todd and stuff.

08:06.509 --> 08:09.146
Maybe I should just go check on him,
make sure he's okay.

08:09.171 --> 08:13.344
Uh, no. You do not go see
your ex after a breakup, okay?

08:13.369 --> 08:14.209
Trust me.

08:14.234 --> 08:17.599
Besides, you are way too good for him!

08:17.624 --> 08:18.687
What? I don't know.

08:18.712 --> 08:19.696
Oh, my God!

08:19.721 --> 08:22.304
You are the hottest ever,
and he's like a two, max.

08:22.329 --> 08:23.069
Oh, my God.

08:23.094 --> 08:25.672
You're like Kate Winslet in "Titanic."

08:25.853 --> 08:28.784
You don't want to be chained
to some douchebag fiancé.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.688
You want to be getting it on,

08:30.713 --> 08:33.534
dancing a jig to some fiddle
music with some immigrants,

08:33.558 --> 08:34.684
steaming up the windows.

08:34.711 --> 08:35.951
You want to do all that.

08:35.975 --> 08:38.707
You don't want to be locked
up to some ball and chain.

08:38.732 --> 08:41.765
Todd's like that actor
who played the fiancé.

08:41.791 --> 08:43.057
What's that guy's name?

08:43.082 --> 08:44.578
I-I don't know.

08:44.602 --> 08:46.408
Oh, my God! What is
his name? I don't know.

08:46.433 --> 08:47.832
He's got those eyebrows.

08:49.389 --> 08:50.608
Ow.

08:50.633 --> 08:51.896
- Danny?
- Yeah?!

08:51.921 --> 08:53.687
What is the name of the guy

08:53.712 --> 08:57.228
who played Kate Winslet's fiancé in
"Titanic"?

08:57.253 --> 08:58.706
Uh...

08:58.731 --> 08:59.994
With the eyebrows.

09:00.020 --> 09:03.482
It's not Josh Brolin,
but it's like Josh Brolin.

09:03.507 --> 09:05.002
- Nothing like Josh Brolin.
- No, what's his name?

09:05.027 --> 09:06.451
- Idiot.
- Josh Hartnett.

09:06.477 --> 09:07.299
He's got brows!

09:07.324 --> 09:08.067
- No, it's not.
- No.

09:08.092 --> 09:09.459
- Very wrong.
- Eric Stoltz?

09:09.484 --> 09:10.740
Absolutely not!

09:10.765 --> 09:12.672
Matthew Modine. Matthew Fox!

09:12.697 --> 09:14.935
Oh, my God, you're so worthless!

09:14.960 --> 09:15.901
It doesn't matter. Never mind.

09:15.926 --> 09:17.941
It does matter, because
I know I know it.

09:18.472 --> 09:19.956
Don't know his name. Idiot.

09:19.981 --> 09:21.005
It's fine.

09:21.029 --> 09:23.037
Not Stoltz?

09:25.586 --> 09:30.737
Anyways, you have got to
release your inner Winslet.

09:30.762 --> 09:31.385
Mmm.

09:31.410 --> 09:34.230
Okay, and I'm talking about rebound sex.

09:34.255 --> 09:35.774
Oh, my God! No, no, no, no, no.

09:35.799 --> 09:37.875
- I do not think I can do that.
- Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

09:37.900 --> 09:40.354
No. No, no, no.

09:40.379 --> 09:43.533
Some guys are like

09:44.392 --> 09:46.318
Uh...  Oh! Oh!

09:46.343 --> 09:48.885
Pa-pow!

09:48.910 --> 09:50.488
No, no, no, no.

09:55.571 --> 09:56.974
Somebody!

09:58.357 --> 10:01.133
A wild animal fell in here.
I'm not kidding this time!

10:01.159 --> 10:03.247
Somebody come get it! Oh, my God!

10:03.532 --> 10:05.966
All right, fine! I'll deal with it.

10:07.575 --> 10:09.261
Okay. Okay, Todd.

10:09.286 --> 10:11.255
Okay, Todd, you're a badass, Todd.

10:11.280 --> 10:12.494
Do it! Do it!

10:15.143 --> 10:16.325
Get ready to die!

10:19.908 --> 10:21.751
This is killing me.

10:21.776 --> 10:24.221
Yeah, I know. I found that tarp.

10:24.246 --> 10:24.968
What?!

10:24.993 --> 10:26.599
I should be able to do with
my tarp whatever I want.

10:26.624 --> 10:28.318
He finds a tarp,
he can do whatever he wants.

10:28.343 --> 10:29.685
He can build a shelter
with his own tarp.

10:29.711 --> 10:31.729
I respect tarps.
That's not a problem for me.

10:31.754 --> 10:33.759
I'm just trying to get
people off the island.

10:33.784 --> 10:34.762
I'm trying to figure out

10:34.787 --> 10:37.155
who played Kate Winslet's fiancé in
"Titanic."

10:37.233 --> 10:39.692
- Who cares?
- Like half the island.

10:39.717 --> 10:42.538
None of us can remember his name.

10:42.563 --> 10:45.027
I mean, back home, we would know in,
like, two seconds.

10:45.052 --> 10:46.042
I'm sorry.

10:46.258 --> 10:48.285
I can't work until I figure this out.

10:48.310 --> 10:49.949
I'm going to ask somebody else.

10:51.328 --> 10:53.755
All right. Team, let's get together!

10:53.780 --> 10:55.526
Let's figure this out right now!

10:55.551 --> 10:58.429
The ship is going
down. He's a real dick.

10:58.455 --> 11:00.558
Oh, who was that actor, right, guys?!

11:00.583 --> 11:03.484
Oh, I can't even think
about building this shelter

11:03.509 --> 11:04.806
till we figure this out.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.022
If only we were back home!

11:09.618 --> 11:11.218
Eric Roberts?

11:11.253 --> 11:13.220
James Marsden.

11:13.255 --> 11:14.834
Oh, one of the Dillons.

11:14.859 --> 11:17.233
No, no, and no!

11:17.258 --> 11:19.670
Oh, wait. Is he the
guy from "The Mummy"?

11:19.695 --> 11:21.561
You know, the guy that plays the mummy.

11:21.815 --> 11:24.222
You mean Arnold Vosloo?

11:24.247 --> 11:25.253
Yeah.

11:25.278 --> 11:27.717
Are we serious, Pablo?!

11:27.742 --> 11:30.201
Why don't you get the
out of here, okay?!

11:30.227 --> 11:31.583
Why don't you go take a walk

11:31.607 --> 11:33.525
and start using your brain on that walk

11:33.550 --> 11:35.246
and come back when you have some ideas!

11:35.270 --> 11:37.100
Is this really happening?

11:38.019 --> 11:40.086
I just wish I had my phone, you know?

11:40.111 --> 11:41.442
- God damn it!
- Right?

11:41.467 --> 11:42.030
Shit!

11:42.055 --> 11:45.523
I feel like the only way we're
gonna get this guy's name

11:45.548 --> 11:47.497
is if we stop waiting around
for something to happen

11:47.522 --> 11:50.721
and actually do something ourselves,
you know?

11:50.746 --> 11:51.977
Right? Yeah, okay.

11:52.002 --> 11:53.787
I'm gonna go start working on my boat

11:53.811 --> 11:56.264
because something tells me
these people are gonna want

11:56.289 --> 11:58.709
to get off this island
sooner rather than later.

11:58.734 --> 11:59.972
And that tarp is as good as mine.

11:59.997 --> 12:01.205
Yeah, sure. Whatever, man.

12:01.230 --> 12:03.836
Billy Crudup. Huh? No?

12:03.861 --> 12:05.612
- Damn it!
- What's all this?

12:05.637 --> 12:06.868
Why have you stopped working?

12:06.893 --> 12:09.506
We're trying to figure out who
played the fiancé in "Titanic."

12:09.532 --> 12:11.259
It's extremely important.

12:11.475 --> 12:13.587
Is it? Come on, Owen.

12:13.612 --> 12:15.036
Sounds a bit silly.

12:15.061 --> 12:17.228
Silly? Sounds a bit silly?

12:17.513 --> 12:19.546
Okay, if we as an island cannot remember

12:19.571 --> 12:22.866
the name of one of the
world's finest actors,

12:22.892 --> 12:24.883
what are we gonna forget next, huh?

12:24.908 --> 12:27.291
Music? What beauty is?

12:27.315 --> 12:28.955
Huh? Harry Potter?!

12:29.001 --> 12:29.984
- No!
- No!

12:30.009 --> 12:31.172
- Great series.
- Yeah.

12:31.197 --> 12:32.405
Guys, back home,

12:32.430 --> 12:35.031
we were living in the
golden age of information.

12:35.581 --> 12:38.729
Here, we are one step away
from living like apes!

12:38.754 --> 12:39.739
Like apes!

12:39.764 --> 12:42.009
Soon, we're probably gonna be
hucking our poop at each other,

12:42.034 --> 12:43.691
jerking off out in the open.

12:43.868 --> 12:46.323
This guy already did once, I think.

12:46.348 --> 12:48.859
Do you want to Huck your
own poop at people, Diane?

12:48.884 --> 12:50.771
- No!
- You want to Huck poop!

12:50.796 --> 12:52.443
- No!
- Is that what you want, Diane?!

12:52.468 --> 12:54.859
- No!
- I didn't think so!

12:55.722 --> 12:58.409
This is not about just
the name of an actor.

12:58.434 --> 13:00.395
This is about our humanity.

13:00.420 --> 13:02.108
Right, guys? Who's with me?!

13:02.133 --> 13:04.268
Come on!

13:04.293 --> 13:06.112
- That's right!
- Yeah!

13:06.137 --> 13:08.461
- Yes! I'm with you!
- Yeah!

13:08.486 --> 13:10.580
Yeah!

13:11.268 --> 13:13.767
Anthony Edwards?

13:15.193 --> 13:16.299
Buddy?

13:16.324 --> 13:18.491
You ain't looking too good.

13:18.792 --> 13:20.158
You're alive?

13:20.183 --> 13:22.450
Who, me?

13:22.475 --> 13:24.755
Oh. Oh, hell no.

13:24.780 --> 13:26.730
I'm deader than a doorknob.

13:26.755 --> 13:28.815
- So is my old buddy Jerry here.
- How you doing?

13:28.840 --> 13:31.841
How the shit are you talking right now?

13:31.866 --> 13:35.374
Well, my guess,
and I am speaking from some experience,

13:35.400 --> 13:38.087
is that you are in the
final hallucinating stage

13:38.112 --> 13:39.112
of starvation.

13:39.137 --> 13:41.504
Oh, yeah. Your little
body's shutting down.

13:41.530 --> 13:42.673
Is that how you guys died?

13:42.697 --> 13:44.519
Oh, no, no, unh-unh. I took him out.

13:44.545 --> 13:46.272
Oh, bullshit! I got you first.

13:46.297 --> 13:47.546
I got you with a choke hold.

13:47.571 --> 13:49.075
- Oh! Eat stick!
- Yeah, find out who's getting...

13:49.100 --> 13:51.054
Hey! Hey!

13:51.318 --> 13:53.902
Stop it! Stop it!

13:53.927 --> 13:57.429
Stop fighting! Stop fighting!

13:57.454 --> 13:59.718
Agree to disagree!

13:59.743 --> 14:01.157
How did this happen?

14:01.182 --> 14:04.117
Well, after the crash,
we landed out here.

14:04.142 --> 14:06.749
Food ran out about five days ago,

14:06.774 --> 14:09.341
and things went bad fast.

14:09.366 --> 14:13.197
I'm never gonna let this country
jackass make a meal out of me.

14:13.222 --> 14:15.887
- Jackass?!
- Oh, gross!

14:15.912 --> 14:19.343
How could you guys even
think about eating a person?!

14:19.368 --> 14:21.327
I hate to break it to you, pal,

14:21.448 --> 14:23.312
but you're thinking about it right now.

14:23.337 --> 14:25.597
No, no. No, no, I'm not!

14:25.622 --> 14:26.773
- No, I'm not.
- Whoa.

14:26.798 --> 14:29.154
Man, just think of us
for what we really are...

14:29.343 --> 14:31.687
Two piles of meat!

14:31.713 --> 14:33.075
- Mmm!
- No.

14:33.100 --> 14:34.411
Finger-licking.

14:34.436 --> 14:36.169
No.

14:36.581 --> 14:37.680
No.

14:37.705 --> 14:39.226
- All you can eat.
- No.

14:39.251 --> 14:41.345
The buffet is open.

14:45.215 --> 14:46.738
What?

14:47.282 --> 14:48.721
You hungry?

14:49.566 --> 14:51.851
Well, sucks for you.

14:51.876 --> 14:55.281
Should have brought something to eat,
shouldn't you have?

14:57.837 --> 15:00.626
All right.

15:03.127 --> 15:05.597
These are Cheez-Its. They're precious.

15:05.622 --> 15:06.777
It's my last bag.

15:09.468 --> 15:11.375
Good shit, right?

15:13.470 --> 15:15.551
I'm gonna name you Meat.

15:19.977 --> 15:22.811
All right, Owen. The
was quite the prank.

15:22.836 --> 15:24.002
Well done.

15:24.027 --> 15:25.797
I think this should end now, though.

15:25.822 --> 15:28.156
I want everyone to get
back to the shelter.

15:28.898 --> 15:30.765
What's the matter, Steve, huh?

15:30.790 --> 15:33.533
You worried that if people
don't find this place livable,

15:33.558 --> 15:35.417
they might want to give me the tarp?

15:37.253 --> 15:39.870
Owen, do you know the
name of that actor?

15:40.189 --> 15:43.125
Well, maybe I do and maybe I don't.

15:45.694 --> 15:48.014
Well, if you won't end it, I will.

15:48.214 --> 15:51.382
Okay, well, unless you know the name,
I'd like to see you try.

15:51.407 --> 15:52.766
I know the name.

15:53.175 --> 15:56.825
How does Stanley Tucci sound?

15:56.958 --> 15:58.417
Yeah, that's not even close.

15:58.442 --> 16:00.385
Oh! God damn it!

16:00.894 --> 16:02.497
Sure it was Tucci.

16:02.522 --> 16:04.689
He's been in so many goddamn things.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.260
All the faces look the same.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.905
I got it!

16:11.931 --> 16:12.830
I got it.

16:12.854 --> 16:14.451
I know the name!

16:14.476 --> 16:16.543
Rupert Everett!

16:16.796 --> 16:19.178
We already said Rupert Everett, Pablo!

16:19.204 --> 16:20.851
Oh!

16:22.444 --> 16:23.282
What's wrong with you?!

16:24.260 --> 16:25.652
I can't remember!

16:25.677 --> 16:27.476
None of us can remember, Diane!

16:27.501 --> 16:31.228
No, I mean I can't remember
what my dog smells like!

16:31.253 --> 16:32.956
Oh, God.

16:33.418 --> 16:36.501
Dear God, it's begun.

16:39.911 --> 16:42.745
What is beauty?

16:43.724 --> 16:45.756
Oh, look at us.

16:46.374 --> 16:48.819
It's a real shame, isn't it?

16:48.845 --> 16:49.924
You know, I just wish

16:49.949 --> 16:52.077
Owen would tell us what
the name is already.

16:52.125 --> 16:55.140
Owen knows the name?

16:56.087 --> 16:58.124
Yeah.

16:58.149 --> 16:59.307
Yep.

16:59.332 --> 17:00.420
Let's get him!

17:08.285 --> 17:09.625
Owen!

17:09.650 --> 17:10.952
Tell us the name of the actor

17:10.977 --> 17:12.656
who played the fiancé from "Titanic"

17:12.682 --> 17:13.986
or we'll rip your head off!

17:14.011 --> 17:15.464
Owen, I told them you didn't know.

17:15.489 --> 17:16.974
- Oh, God!
- He knows!

17:17.000 --> 17:18.590
He's just keeping it from us

17:18.616 --> 17:21.126
to get back at Steve for
taking his stupid tarp.

17:21.151 --> 17:23.494
Hey, hey, I don't know
the name, I swear.

17:23.520 --> 17:26.521
If he won't tell us the name,
we'll tear his boat apart.

17:26.545 --> 17:27.583
Let's go!

17:27.608 --> 17:29.188
Hey, wait, wait! Wait!

17:29.213 --> 17:32.233
Okay, this is exactly
why we shouldn't be here.

17:32.258 --> 17:33.812
Guys, we cannot live like this!

17:33.837 --> 17:36.100
This is the reason that
we should take this boat

17:36.126 --> 17:37.793
and we should leave the island.

17:38.647 --> 17:40.772
- Tear his boat apart!
- Yeah!

17:40.797 --> 17:42.924
No, no, no! Hey, no!

17:42.949 --> 17:44.358
No!

17:58.360 --> 18:00.301
Oh, everyone!

18:00.326 --> 18:02.526
Look at what Owen has done to us.

18:02.551 --> 18:04.562
Shame on him for causing this.

18:04.587 --> 18:06.013
But shame on us.

18:06.202 --> 18:07.745
We've stooped just as low.

18:07.770 --> 18:09.778
But he won't tell us the name!

18:09.804 --> 18:12.140
We have to know the name!

18:12.165 --> 18:13.541
Well, there's another way.

18:13.566 --> 18:16.233
- What way?
- We try and stop remembering.

18:16.389 --> 18:19.001
We busy our minds with
building the shelter.

18:19.510 --> 18:21.202
We just let the answer come to us.

18:21.227 --> 18:23.041
What if it doesn't work?

18:23.727 --> 18:27.103
Then we're coming for Owen.

18:29.583 --> 18:31.898
You see, the thing about monogamy

18:31.923 --> 18:34.591
is nature doesn't wire us that way.

18:34.616 --> 18:36.575
Exactly!

18:36.600 --> 18:37.691
You know what I mean?

18:37.716 --> 18:40.984
Guy like this, a lot of options.

18:42.216 --> 18:43.446
What the hell?

18:43.621 --> 18:45.711
Meat, stay back.

18:48.030 --> 18:49.329
All right, listen,

18:49.354 --> 18:51.425
we're gonna keep you out of sight,
all right?

18:51.450 --> 18:53.175
'Cause if they knew
you were down here...

18:55.084 --> 18:56.350
they'd eat you.

18:57.640 --> 18:59.439
And you don't want to be eaten, do you?

18:59.464 --> 19:00.535
No, you don't.

19:00.560 --> 19:02.855
You don't want to be eaten.

19:02.880 --> 19:05.281
No, no, no, no, no, no.

19:06.818 --> 19:09.014
- Who's it gonna be, man?
- Shut up.

19:09.039 --> 19:10.592
I kind of cut Gary open a little bit.

19:10.618 --> 19:12.636
Probably dig in there,
get some good rib meat.

19:12.661 --> 19:14.481
- Shut up!
- You don't want me, man.

19:14.506 --> 19:16.154
I'm all dry inside.

19:16.179 --> 19:21.049
But look at this thick...
Oh... juicy rump on Jerry.

19:21.073 --> 19:23.273
I'm gonna tell you what,
if I had my choice,

19:23.298 --> 19:25.283
that's exactly where
I'd sink my chompers.

19:25.308 --> 19:26.595
- This?
- That.

19:26.620 --> 19:28.163
Yeah, you do not want any of this.

19:28.188 --> 19:29.673
I haven't worked out in years.

19:29.698 --> 19:31.371
This is like a can of uncooked biscuits.

19:31.396 --> 19:35.859
That is some grade-A, 100% flank steak.

19:35.884 --> 19:37.467
Put a little bitty
pat of butter on that.

19:37.959 --> 19:39.708
Shut up!

19:39.733 --> 19:43.859
I don't care if I'm
starving or going insane.

19:44.106 --> 19:47.537
I am not eating a person.

19:48.371 --> 19:51.198
That's a bridge you can't uncross.

19:51.959 --> 19:54.389
Okay, so just... Aah!

19:54.414 --> 19:55.746
- Yo, Gary.
- Uh-oh.

19:55.787 --> 19:57.648
I don't even think this
dude wants to live.

19:57.673 --> 19:58.591
He doesn't.

19:58.617 --> 19:59.675
Of course I want to live.

19:59.700 --> 20:01.812
Then give yourself a chance, man.

20:01.837 --> 20:03.622
Here.

20:03.647 --> 20:06.462
This is the jungle, Pack.

20:06.487 --> 20:09.543
It is kill or be killed.

20:09.567 --> 20:11.036
Eat or be eaten.

20:11.061 --> 20:11.990
No, no, no!

20:12.014 --> 20:13.389
Don't you want to survive?

20:13.414 --> 20:14.525
- I want to survive.
- Cross that bridge.

20:14.550 --> 20:15.926
You hear that sound?

20:15.951 --> 20:17.784
That's your mama's dinner bell ringing.

20:17.809 --> 20:20.657
Ding, ding. Ding, ding.

20:20.682 --> 20:23.049
My mama doesn't have a dinner bell.

20:25.560 --> 20:27.537
Well, would you look at this shelter?!

20:30.012 --> 20:32.296
And the tarp fits perfectly!

20:32.638 --> 20:35.040
See, we could make a life here.

20:35.065 --> 20:36.344
That's what's important.

20:36.369 --> 20:37.458
He's right.

20:37.482 --> 20:39.184
I mean, look at what we've built.

20:39.209 --> 20:40.880
Who cares about what's his name?

20:40.905 --> 20:42.329
Steve, Steve!

20:43.504 --> 20:44.737
That's the spirit.

20:44.762 --> 20:45.816
Oh!

20:45.841 --> 20:48.680
Come on, everyone. Get inside!

20:53.942 --> 20:55.761
You okay, man?
