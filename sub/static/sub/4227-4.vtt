The harness, is a process.

00:04.639 --> 00:06.493
And Ben isn't free from it.

00:06.522 --> 00:07.622
Looking for you family?

00:07.647 --> 00:09.590
I combed that
rubble for a long time...

00:09.615 --> 00:10.633
but they were gone.

00:10.658 --> 00:12.672
What were you and Jimmy doing
hunting Skitters, Ben?

00:12.697 --> 00:13.925
I need a reason?

00:13.950 --> 00:16.103
I'm sorry.
He's gone.

00:17.347 --> 00:18.235
You want out?

00:19.723 --> 00:20.720
There's the door.

00:21.636 --> 00:24.039
I can't protect them anymore.
We can't protect them anymore.

That's the craziest thing
I ever seen!

02:00.570 --> 02:02.178
What is that,
26 and 27?

02:02.213 --> 02:03.187
27 and 28.

02:03.222 --> 02:04.263
Tick tick,

02:04.305 --> 02:05.271
Boom!
Boom!

02:05.313 --> 02:06.587
Respect.

02:06.622 --> 02:08.604
Yo, Eminem!
You a'ight?

02:12.263 --> 02:13.644
That...

02:13.679 --> 02:15.153
was...

02:15.187 --> 02:16.602
awesome!

02:17.844 --> 02:19.352

Whoo!

02:37.315 --> 02:39.060
You see that steam?

02:39.094 --> 02:40.940
And the lights on?

02:40.974 --> 02:43.420
The building's got power.

02:45.435 --> 02:46.579
Well, whatever they're up to
in there,

02:46.614 --> 02:48.353
it's none
of our concern.

02:48.388 --> 02:51.912
Our orders are to find
the safest way to Charleston,

02:51.946 --> 02:54.191
which means we'll steer
a wide path around this place.

02:56.038 --> 02:59.189
You've been quiet lately.

02:59.223 --> 03:01.201
Got nothing to say.

03:01.236 --> 03:05.059
You eat by yourself,
you barely sleep.

03:05.093 --> 03:07.004
It's like
you're a different person.

03:07.038 --> 03:09.083
I don't want to talk
about it.

03:09.117 --> 03:10.761
We all miss Jimmy.

03:10.795 --> 03:14.278
But you got to figure out a way
to put that behind you.

03:15.823 --> 03:18.101
Hey!

03:18.135 --> 03:20.951
Those are our bikes!

03:25.978 --> 03:27.788
Can you believe that?

03:27.822 --> 03:31.004
Where the hell
did they come from?

03:32.710 --> 03:35.962
We're not going back to camp
without those bikes.

03:41.926 --> 03:42.997
What are you doing?

03:43.032 --> 03:44.369
I'm just trying something.

03:48.257 --> 03:50.833
They're headed east.

03:50.871 --> 03:53.414
How do you know?

03:53.449 --> 03:55.057
I can hear their engines.

04:10.214 --> 04:12.114
Take those
in to the mess for me.

04:12.149 --> 04:13.816
Thank you.

04:15.951 --> 04:17.517
Look at me.

04:22.457 --> 04:24.991
Good news.

04:25.025 --> 04:26.325
Aliens left?

04:26.360 --> 04:28.060
Who told you?

04:28.128 --> 04:31.529
I wanted to be the first.
I thought you'd be so impressed.

04:31.564 --> 04:32.864
Ha, ha.

04:32.898 --> 04:35.299
So did you actually have
good news?

04:37.903 --> 04:38.870
A chocopie?

04:38.904 --> 04:40.538
Where did you get this?

04:40.572 --> 04:44.042
My unit found a Korean grocery
that hadn't even been touched.

04:44.076 --> 04:45.544
We got enough food
for a week.

04:45.579 --> 04:46.847
Mm!

04:46.881 --> 04:48.321
And I remember
you saying

04:48.356 --> 04:50.828
that you really liked those
when you were a kid.

04:50.862 --> 04:52.501
I was addicted.

04:52.535 --> 04:57.354
These things kept me rolling in
baby fat till I hit high school.

04:57.388 --> 05:01.199
I never thought I'd have
anything like this again.

05:04.610 --> 05:07.117
Me neither.

05:08.455 --> 05:10.929
Hi.

05:17.145 --> 05:19.045
Hi.

05:38.030 --> 05:40.164
Oh, sorry. Um...

05:40.198 --> 05:41.332
No, that's --

05:41.366 --> 05:43.133
Don't mind me.
I'm just, um...

05:43.168 --> 05:45.169
No, it's okay.
I got to go find, uh...

05:45.203 --> 05:47.537
Matt! I sent him
on his first mission today.

05:47.605 --> 05:49.606
Well, then, I'm --
I'm just gonna go --

05:49.640 --> 05:51.507
Okay.

06:19.632 --> 06:21.366
Well, we'll find some.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.501
Now that we got enough wheels to
get out of this hell hole.

06:24.536 --> 06:26.945
Maybe we could go
to the Blue Mountains.

06:26.946 --> 06:28.543
Lots of wildlife.

06:28.578 --> 06:31.646
Be nice to have
some fresh meat for a change.

06:31.681 --> 06:33.983
What do you know
about hunting?

06:34.017 --> 06:35.485
More than you.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.954
My dad used to take my sister
and me.

06:41.892 --> 06:43.526
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

06:45.061 --> 06:46.862
I just want to talk
about the bikes.

06:46.896 --> 06:51.833
15 to 1?
There's nothing to talk about.

06:53.169 --> 06:55.770
Get the hell out.

06:55.804 --> 06:57.171
I'd back off
if I were you.

06:57.206 --> 06:59.106
Yeah?

06:59.141 --> 07:01.508
Yeah.

07:04.912 --> 07:08.546
Now, if they don't stand down
in 5 seconds, you die.

07:09.648 --> 07:14.018
1...

07:14.052 --> 07:15.586

07:16.821 --> 07:18.588

07:18.622 --> 07:22.492

07:22.526 --> 07:23.760
Diego...

07:23.795 --> 07:26.563
4...

07:26.597 --> 07:28.498
Stand down.

07:28.532 --> 07:29.866
Put your guns down.

07:29.900 --> 07:32.702
All of you --
put your guns on the ground.

07:39.644 --> 07:42.045
Diego?
That's your name?

07:42.079 --> 07:47.049
Well, I'm Hal.
And that's my brother, Ben.

07:47.083 --> 07:49.551
Just take the bikes
and go.

08:02.731 --> 08:05.065
It's just you guys here?
No adults?

08:05.099 --> 08:06.233
We don't need them.

08:06.267 --> 08:08.101
Adults get us killed.

08:08.136 --> 08:11.871
We look out
for each other.

08:17.043 --> 08:20.645
Our people are camped out
not far from here.

08:20.713 --> 08:23.214
We might be able to spare
some extra bike parts.

08:23.248 --> 08:25.750
At the very least,
food and water.

08:25.785 --> 08:29.287
You all look like you could use
a good meal, no offense.

08:31.590 --> 08:33.225
Say yes.

08:33.259 --> 08:36.092
Hilary, Sean, Julian, and Rob,
come with us to check it out.

08:36.128 --> 08:37.094
The rest of you...

08:37.129 --> 08:38.696
hold down the fort.

08:38.730 --> 08:40.597
We'll be back
as soon as possible.

08:48.672 --> 08:50.139
Thanks.

08:58.013 --> 08:59.180
All right, all right.

08:59.248 --> 09:00.815

09:23.302 --> 09:24.901
Hey. Hey.

09:24.936 --> 09:26.635
Yo, what gives,
mason jar?

09:26.670 --> 09:28.837
He's 9 years old. Beer?
Use your head.

09:28.871 --> 09:30.706
Little man's just
on cup-holder duty.

09:30.773 --> 09:32.374
We're celebrating.
Yeah?

09:32.408 --> 09:34.275
Two more kills
this morning, boss.

09:34.310 --> 09:36.010
Really? Yeah?
Dad, it was so awesome!

09:36.044 --> 09:39.046
I led two Skitters all by myself
into Tector's field of fire.

09:39.080 --> 09:40.881
What do you mean
you "led"?

09:40.915 --> 09:42.616
He was just
supposed to be a runner.

09:42.650 --> 09:46.852
"Report back to camp if you saw
any alien activity."

09:46.886 --> 09:48.654
We saw an opportunity,
seized the initiative.

09:51.924 --> 09:53.725
And used my son
as Skitter bait?

09:53.759 --> 09:56.627
They were boxed in, man.
It was fish in a barrel.

09:56.661 --> 09:58.629
Dad, it's not a big --
Matthew.

09:58.663 --> 10:02.032
Look, Teck and I have killed
more Skitters than anybody else.

10:02.066 --> 10:04.167
Shut up, Boon.
The man's right. We screwed up.

10:04.201 --> 10:07.202
No, we didn't.
A screw-up is if we miss.

10:07.237 --> 10:10.305
What if you had missed?
Our job is not to miss.

10:10.339 --> 10:13.774
Hey, you're 20 years old! You
were selling cellphones a year ago!

10:13.808 --> 10:15.008
What if you had missed?!

10:15.043 --> 10:16.743
We don't miss --
Boon!

10:16.778 --> 10:21.047
My orders were clear --
man an observation post,

10:21.081 --> 10:25.019
not paint a target
on my 9-year-old's back!

10:25.053 --> 10:28.224
You can take that Barrett rifle
and give it to the second team.

10:28.259 --> 10:30.128
You're off sniper duty.

10:30.162 --> 10:34.898
And you can both go join the
sanitation crew until further notice.

10:34.932 --> 10:36.266
Dismissed.

10:37.267 --> 10:39.068
Let's go.

10:41.371 --> 10:45.073
You're gonna sit out the next
couple of missions, Matt.

10:45.108 --> 10:48.710
Great.
You've ruined everything.

10:49.778 --> 10:51.746
Whoa.

10:51.780 --> 10:54.714
Trouble in paradise?

10:54.749 --> 10:57.950
Discipline issue.
Nothing I can't handle.

11:00.287 --> 11:02.388
Must be Hal and Ben.

11:09.127 --> 11:10.361
What do we have here?

11:10.395 --> 11:11.862
Found them holed up
in a warehouse.

11:11.897 --> 11:14.398
Half-starved.
No adults.

11:14.432 --> 11:16.733
Maybe we can
help them out.

11:23.373 --> 11:24.973
Jeanne?

11:25.008 --> 11:26.907
Dad.

11:28.007 --> 11:29.173
Jeanne?!

11:32.042 --> 11:33.709
Daddy.
Jeanne!

11:33.744 --> 11:35.011
My girl.

11:39.215 --> 11:41.183
Jeanne.

11:51.604 --> 11:53.473
How did she die?

11:53.508 --> 11:56.445
Stroke.

11:56.479 --> 11:59.281
She ran out of her
blood-pressure medication.

11:59.315 --> 12:01.583
Mom always
forgot to refill it.

12:01.617 --> 12:03.385
I used to do it
for her.

12:03.419 --> 12:04.686
Me too.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.954
After you guys split.

12:11.625 --> 12:14.159
I thought about you a lot.

12:14.193 --> 12:16.361
I figured you were dead.

12:23.970 --> 12:28.338
I came looking for you,
Jeanne.

12:28.372 --> 12:33.075
For you, and for your mother,
and for...

12:33.110 --> 12:35.077
for your sister.

12:35.111 --> 12:38.246
Wish I'd gotten there
sooner.

12:41.583 --> 12:44.318
We're together now.

12:44.353 --> 12:46.153
That's all that matters.

12:49.257 --> 12:50.758
I missed you, papa bear.

12:54.329 --> 12:57.563
I missed you, too,
baby bear.

13:17.683 --> 13:20.517
And what else?

13:20.551 --> 13:22.386
Did you spot the factory
on Barnard and High Street?

13:22.420 --> 13:23.487
Yeah, now,
we saw that one.

13:23.521 --> 13:25.355
Lots of
battle bots there.

13:25.389 --> 13:28.391
Kids with those parasites on
their backs, and chinches, too.

13:28.425 --> 13:29.391
Chinches?

13:29.426 --> 13:30.525
The big bugs.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.394
Oh, no, yeah.
We call 'em Skitters.

13:32.429 --> 13:34.031
Oh.

13:35.268 --> 13:37.071
My bad.

13:38.539 --> 13:40.640
I'm gonna get you back.

13:40.675 --> 13:42.609
That your girlfriend?

13:42.676 --> 13:45.578
No. Nah, nah, nah, nah. Nah.
We're just friends.

13:45.612 --> 13:48.013
You're kidding, right?

13:48.047 --> 13:51.416
That girl just kicked
a soccer ball in your face

13:51.450 --> 13:54.119
and you're smiling
like you just won the lottery?

13:54.187 --> 13:55.120
Nah.

13:55.188 --> 13:56.421
Hey, Dad.

13:56.455 --> 13:58.523
Diego was just giving us
some great intel

13:58.557 --> 14:00.391
on our way
down to Charleston.

14:00.426 --> 14:02.593
Good.
What's in Charleston, anyway?

14:02.627 --> 14:04.261
Rumors of survivors
organizing

14:04.296 --> 14:06.530
a pretty substantial force
against the invasion.

14:06.564 --> 14:09.132
Your group's welcome to join us
if you want.

14:09.200 --> 14:11.201
We'll think about it.

14:11.235 --> 14:13.436
Truck's ready if you want
to start loading your supplies.

14:13.470 --> 14:14.637
Jamil scrounged up
some bike parts.

14:14.671 --> 14:17.038
You might
be able to fix yours with.

14:17.072 --> 14:19.473
Sorry we can't give you more,
but we're pretty thin as it is.

14:19.508 --> 14:21.508
It's more
than all right.

14:28.415 --> 14:30.583
All right.
Come on. Let's go.

14:32.285 --> 14:33.318
Let's go.

14:44.792 --> 14:46.158
Matt.

14:47.794 --> 14:50.595
Hey, I'm sorry if I
embarrassed you yesterday.

14:50.630 --> 14:53.131
No, you aren't.

14:53.166 --> 14:54.666
Matt.
What?

14:54.733 --> 14:57.335
I know you want to be a fighter,
but you got a lot to learn.

14:57.402 --> 14:59.570
Following orders,
for starters.

14:59.604 --> 15:02.306
I did a good job.
I killed two Skitters.

15:02.340 --> 15:04.408
You could have gotten yourself
killed in the process.

15:04.443 --> 15:05.843
It wasn't smart.

15:05.877 --> 15:10.280
Well, neither was getting onto
an alien spaceship, Dad.

15:14.352 --> 15:18.354
You remember these, from
your volleyball tournaments?

15:18.389 --> 15:19.722
You were a hit.

15:19.756 --> 15:22.858
Mm-hmm.

15:22.892 --> 15:25.494
We're gonna go load up the
truck, if you want to come help.

15:25.528 --> 15:27.128
I'll be there
in a minute.

15:27.163 --> 15:29.097
Daddy,
did you meet Diego?

15:29.131 --> 15:33.201
Not properly. I'm Dan.
I've heard a lot about you.

15:36.672 --> 15:38.306
Hey, uh...

15:38.807 --> 15:41.342
<i>Te veo afuera, chiquita.</i>

15:41.376 --> 15:43.610
<i>Sí, mi Amor.</i>
<i>Nos vemos ahorita.</i>

15:47.281 --> 15:49.115
You speakin' Spanish now?

15:49.149 --> 15:52.651
Yes, Dad. I speak Spanish.
He's my boyfriend.

15:52.685 --> 15:54.720
Friendly guy.

15:55.421 --> 15:57.155
He's just being
protective.

15:57.189 --> 15:59.157
Protective? Of what?

16:00.525 --> 16:03.293
You just got to
get to know him.

16:03.327 --> 16:04.861
Be open-minded, okay?

16:04.896 --> 16:06.396
I am open-minded.

16:06.431 --> 16:09.299
Since when?

16:09.334 --> 16:11.868
<i>Iapurenle!</i>
<i>While I'm still young, people!</i>

16:11.903 --> 16:13.903
<i>Iya hay que darle matarile</i>
<i>a esto!</i>

16:25.181 --> 16:25.914
Diego.

16:49.602 --> 16:50.702
Hey, what's wrong?

16:50.736 --> 16:52.670
I can't talk. Sorry.

16:54.773 --> 16:55.573
Hey.

16:55.607 --> 16:56.841
Hi.

16:56.875 --> 16:59.410
Nice hat.
You a baseball fan?

16:59.444 --> 17:01.177
No.
I just found it.

17:01.212 --> 17:02.845
You're the kid
who helped kill

17:02.880 --> 17:04.713
those chinches
yesterday, huh?

17:04.748 --> 17:06.714
Skitters.

17:06.749 --> 17:08.317
Yeah, that was me.

17:09.484 --> 17:10.919
Sounded
pretty cool, man.

17:10.953 --> 17:12.420
It was.

17:12.454 --> 17:14.622
I was on my scooter
and I saw two Skitters

17:14.690 --> 17:16.391
but pretended
like I didn't,

17:16.425 --> 17:19.294
and then I led them into
Boon and Tector's field of fire,

17:19.362 --> 17:21.329
and they shot their heads off,
and they exploded like...

17:21.363 --> 17:23.297
Bashoo! Bashoo!

17:23.365 --> 17:25.366
That's pretty good.

17:26.467 --> 17:28.201
- We're loaded.
- Oh.

17:28.236 --> 17:29.936
I was thinking maybe
I should go with you.

17:29.971 --> 17:31.604
Don't worry, Dad.
I'll be fine.

17:31.638 --> 17:33.272
You're just
dropping the supplies,

17:33.306 --> 17:34.640
and you're
coming right back.

17:34.707 --> 17:36.207
We'll be gone
an hour, tops.

17:36.242 --> 17:37.442
You coming?

17:37.476 --> 17:39.710
Of course.

17:39.744 --> 17:42.746
Ahora, mount up,
manitos!

17:42.780 --> 17:44.881
I'm gonna get you back.
You know that, right?

17:44.915 --> 17:46.449
Is that a fact?

17:51.387 --> 17:55.589
Yes, I like to say, "vengeance
is mine, saith the Hal."

18:24.800 --> 18:26.300
This doesn't look good.

18:40.212 --> 18:43.816
Somebody ripped up
our place.

18:53.225 --> 18:55.826
Robbie's jacket.

19:01.233 --> 19:03.100
Somebody, help!

19:07.972 --> 19:10.073
Jonny,
are you all right?

19:10.107 --> 19:12.341
Chinches.

19:12.376 --> 19:13.943
Skitters.

19:13.977 --> 19:15.811
They took everybody.

19:15.845 --> 19:17.413
Hey, buddy,
how long ago was this?

19:17.447 --> 19:19.248
I don't know.

19:23.519 --> 19:25.353
They're gonna be
harnessed.

19:29.680 --> 19:30.911
That factory, right here.

19:30.912 --> 19:32.603
That's where we've seen
a lot of harnessed kids.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.539
And that's the building we saw in
the scouting unit yesterday.

19:34.860 --> 19:35.895
The building has power.

19:35.896 --> 19:37.090
And Mechs guarding it.

19:37.091 --> 19:39.334
Maybe they turned the factory
into a harness facility.

19:39.595 --> 19:42.396
Would explain the security.
Okay. Ben.

19:42.430 --> 19:44.698
What do you remember about the
place where you were harnessed?

19:44.733 --> 19:47.434
Um, not much.
Just fragments.

19:47.469 --> 19:49.569
Anything you can remember
will be helpful.

19:49.604 --> 19:50.870
Um...

19:50.904 --> 19:53.472
first, they kept us
in a holding room.

19:53.507 --> 19:54.873
For how long?

19:54.908 --> 19:57.876
I don't know.
What else?

19:57.910 --> 20:00.746
They took us
to the harnessing chamber.

20:00.780 --> 20:02.347
What was the distance
between

20:02.381 --> 20:04.950
the holding room
and the harnessing chamber?

20:07.286 --> 20:08.920
I'm sorry.
I don't remember.

20:08.954 --> 20:10.388
All right, look.
We're wasting time.

20:10.422 --> 20:11.622
We know they're in there.
Let's go.

20:11.657 --> 20:14.258
Not so fast.
We need a plan.

20:14.292 --> 20:16.393
Improvising gets people killed.
Yeah?

20:16.427 --> 20:17.794
While you're sitting around
making plans,

20:17.828 --> 20:19.762
they're harnessing
our friends.

20:19.796 --> 20:22.797
I'm not gonna put
people's lives at risk

20:22.832 --> 20:25.567
so that you can go off
half-cocked.

20:25.601 --> 20:28.702
Fine.
Stay here with your maps.

20:28.737 --> 20:29.837
I'm going in.

20:29.871 --> 20:31.705
I said no.

20:31.739 --> 20:33.407
I don't take orders
from anyone,

20:33.441 --> 20:35.509
especially a man who couldn't
save his own family.

20:35.543 --> 20:37.511
Hey! You listen to me, there, Sonny boy --
Dad, stop!

20:37.545 --> 20:40.013
You do not talk to me
about my family!

20:40.047 --> 20:41.514
I said stop it!
You hear me?

20:41.549 --> 20:42.949
Stop!

20:42.983 --> 20:44.284
Stop!

20:44.318 --> 20:46.819
I told you
he hasn't changed.

20:48.588 --> 20:50.288
Jeanne, I am sorry.

20:50.322 --> 20:52.257
If you were sorry,
you'd try to be different.

20:52.291 --> 20:54.258
You wouldn't be the same
angry control freak.

20:54.293 --> 20:56.660
This is exactly
why mom kicked you out.

20:56.695 --> 20:58.428
Jeanne.

21:04.835 --> 21:07.403
Finally.
What's the word?

21:07.438 --> 21:08.805
We're going after them.

21:08.839 --> 21:10.606
What about
the 2nd Mass?

21:10.641 --> 21:12.374
Yeah, aren't you supposed to
wait for Weaver and my dad?

21:12.442 --> 21:15.943
I don't need anyone's permission
to go get my own people.

21:15.978 --> 21:17.011
Vamos.

21:19.481 --> 21:20.781
You okay?

21:20.816 --> 21:21.950
Yeah.

21:21.984 --> 21:24.324
Good man.

21:24.358 --> 21:26.365
What about you,
Skitter killer?

21:26.399 --> 21:28.968
There's room
for one more.

21:33.740 --> 21:38.476
Grab your weapons and gear up.
We move out in five.

21:38.510 --> 21:41.612
Ben, you don't have to go along
on this one.

21:41.646 --> 21:43.613
What are you
talking about?

21:43.648 --> 21:45.716
Just, you going back
to a harness facility,

21:45.750 --> 21:47.050
I'm a little worried.

21:47.085 --> 21:49.719
Worried I might freak out
at a critical moment?

21:49.753 --> 21:51.587
No.
No one's thinking that.

21:51.622 --> 21:53.723
Good.
Because I'm going.

21:53.757 --> 21:56.725
Just wanted to let you know you
you had a choice.

21:56.760 --> 21:59.494
Okay. Thanks.

22:03.366 --> 22:05.500
You got a spare shotgun?

22:10.039 --> 22:13.441
You all right?

22:13.509 --> 22:15.576
Everything she said
is true.

22:15.611 --> 22:17.612
I've never been
able to control my anger.

22:17.646 --> 22:19.581
Sweeps through me
like a brush fire.

22:19.615 --> 22:23.584
If I'd been a better husband,
a better father,

22:23.618 --> 22:28.355
her mother and her sister
might still be alive.

22:28.389 --> 22:30.590
There's nothing
I can do about it now.

22:30.624 --> 22:32.358
Yeah, there is.

22:32.392 --> 22:33.892
Talk to her the way
you're talking to me.

22:39.865 --> 22:41.732
Yeah.

22:44.535 --> 22:46.036
Take me with you, boss.

22:46.070 --> 22:47.604
You're benched, Tector.

22:47.638 --> 22:49.372
Please.

22:49.406 --> 22:51.640
I never should have
put your boy at risk.

22:51.675 --> 22:53.642
Give me a chance
to make it right.

22:53.676 --> 22:55.110
All right.
Grab a weapon.

22:55.145 --> 22:57.879
But you're back
on sanitation detail tomorrow.

22:57.913 --> 23:00.147
Yes, sir.

23:16.563 --> 23:19.097
Matt!

23:20.666 --> 23:22.100
Matt!

23:24.436 --> 23:26.070
What's wrong?
Can't find Matt.

23:26.105 --> 23:27.639
He's not in our tent,
he's not in the mess tent.

23:27.673 --> 23:29.407
I don't know
where he is.

23:29.441 --> 23:31.642
He's gone.

23:31.676 --> 23:33.910
Jeanne too.

23:33.944 --> 23:36.512
All the bikes are gone.

23:36.546 --> 23:38.080
They went without us?

23:39.215 --> 23:40.548
Come on.

23:50.995 --> 23:52.391
That's Matt's hat.

23:53.652 --> 23:55.484
You think the cockroaches
got them?

23:55.518 --> 23:56.815
Only one way
to find out.

23:56.849 --> 23:58.248
Maggie, Dai, Tector,
you go in the back.

23:58.282 --> 24:00.744
We'll go in the front.
Let's go!

24:02.212 --> 24:05.639
Don't go loud
unless you have to.

24:05.673 --> 24:07.637
Let's go!

24:07.671 --> 24:09.036
Don't know the layout
of this place

24:09.070 --> 24:10.634
or what we're
walking into.

24:10.669 --> 24:12.068
There's no time
to worry about that.

24:46.764 --> 24:48.865
Help.

24:48.900 --> 24:50.467
Jeanne?

24:50.501 --> 24:53.770
J-Jonny?

24:55.073 --> 24:56.106
It's me, Jeanne.

24:56.140 --> 24:58.107
W-where are we?

24:58.142 --> 25:02.044
Just try to breathe slowly.
I'm right here with you.

25:34.039 --> 25:36.907
What's he doing?!

25:36.941 --> 25:38.809
I'm here, Jonny.

25:51.683 --> 25:53.050
Jeanne!

26:00.925 --> 26:01.925
Get it off!

26:06.096 --> 26:08.097
Get it off!

26:09.566 --> 26:10.932
Jeanne!

26:10.967 --> 26:13.201
Damn you, Chinches!
Go to hell!

26:58.840 --> 27:02.075
They took the others away.
We need to go after them.

27:17.257 --> 27:20.961
No! No!

27:20.995 --> 27:23.998
Dad!

27:28.171 --> 27:30.004
Let me go!

27:30.039 --> 27:31.706
Ugh!

27:31.740 --> 27:32.774
Hey!

27:37.045 --> 27:40.214
Sounds like our team
already found them.

27:51.123 --> 27:53.291
Matt.

27:58.763 --> 28:00.630
Jeanne!

28:00.664 --> 28:02.232
Daddy!
Jeanne!

28:06.170 --> 28:08.270
I'm right here, baby.

28:08.304 --> 28:09.772
Hurry up. Hurry, Dad.

28:09.806 --> 28:11.940
I'm here. I'm here.

28:11.975 --> 28:13.942
It's okay.

28:15.244 --> 28:18.012
You all right?
Yes.

28:18.046 --> 28:19.013
Daddy!

28:19.047 --> 28:20.914
Hey, I'm here.

28:20.949 --> 28:23.016
I'm sorry.
I should have listened to you.

28:23.051 --> 28:25.218
You're okay.
That's all that matters.

28:48.872 --> 28:50.339
Ben.

29:07.022 --> 29:09.223
We're out of here.

29:15.296 --> 29:19.132
Follow me.
Don't look back.

29:39.382 --> 29:42.251
Don't you think you could have
thrown a grenade over there?

29:42.285 --> 29:44.387
Are you okay?

29:44.422 --> 29:46.725
You think you could
get him loose?

29:46.759 --> 29:48.227
We got to
wag it and shag it.

29:48.261 --> 29:49.995
We're gonna have beaucoup
Skitters coming any second.

29:50.029 --> 29:52.264
Ugh!

29:52.298 --> 29:53.999
Ugh!

29:54.033 --> 29:55.934
Son of a -- God.

29:58.170 --> 30:00.104
Ow!

30:11.449 --> 30:14.417
Ugh. I'm all right.
I'm okay. I'm okay.

30:14.451 --> 30:17.888
We got to go.
Let's go! I'm okay!

30:25.812 --> 30:28.249
What is that?
Another pain pill?

30:28.251 --> 30:30.785
Antibiotics,
to prevent infection.

30:30.819 --> 30:33.320
You getting paid
to push 'em?

30:34.890 --> 30:36.323
Take the pill.

30:40.228 --> 30:43.729
All right.

30:43.764 --> 30:45.130
Hey.

30:45.165 --> 30:48.733
I'll check in on you
a little later?

30:51.170 --> 30:52.836
Come on in.

30:54.271 --> 30:55.538
How's the leg?

30:55.573 --> 30:59.108
Oh, it's just a scratch.
It's stupid.

31:07.817 --> 31:11.118
Jeanne...

31:11.153 --> 31:13.654
the things
that you said before...

31:13.689 --> 31:14.789
Forget them.

31:14.823 --> 31:17.558
No. You were right.

31:19.261 --> 31:22.630
I...I let you down.

31:22.664 --> 31:24.765
And...

31:24.799 --> 31:26.900
you deserved better.

31:26.935 --> 31:29.403
Doesn't matter now,
Dad.

31:29.437 --> 31:31.638
I want to make it up
to you.

31:31.672 --> 31:33.406
You already did.

31:33.441 --> 31:35.708
You're not angry?

31:37.611 --> 31:40.179
I'm gonna be honest.

31:40.214 --> 31:42.714
You weren't a great dad.

31:42.749 --> 31:45.850
But you're
an incredible leader.

31:45.885 --> 31:49.186
And the older I get,
the more I appreciate that.

31:49.221 --> 31:52.456
I'm gonna change, Jeanne.
I mean it.

31:52.490 --> 31:53.690
For you.

31:53.725 --> 31:56.159
I know.

31:56.194 --> 31:58.595
Thank you.

32:02.833 --> 32:05.801
I guess that your friends
are getting ready to leave, huh?

32:05.835 --> 32:11.539
They wanted me to thank you
for the extra supplies.

32:11.574 --> 32:13.274
They really liked
all of you.

32:13.309 --> 32:15.277
Even Diego.
Yeah.

32:15.311 --> 32:17.579
But they don't want be
part of the resistance.

32:17.613 --> 32:20.581
They think they have
a better chance of surviving

32:20.616 --> 32:23.751
by avoiding the aliens
and finding a place to hole up.

32:23.786 --> 32:25.654
Well,
they may be right.

32:27.357 --> 32:30.192
You're gonna miss Diego,
aren't you?

32:30.226 --> 32:32.327
Yeah.

32:32.361 --> 32:33.795
I'm gonna miss him
a lot.

32:36.298 --> 32:37.631
I don't want to say goodbye.

32:37.665 --> 32:40.900
Well, hey, come here.
Come here.

32:40.935 --> 32:42.903
It's all right.

32:42.937 --> 32:44.238
I'm sorry.

32:44.272 --> 32:45.906
You don't have to
be sorry.

32:45.940 --> 32:49.375
It's all right, sweetheart.
It's hard, I know.

32:49.410 --> 32:50.909
I know.

32:50.944 --> 32:52.911
Yeah, it is.

32:56.716 --> 32:59.417
Oh, listen, I, uh...

32:59.452 --> 33:01.686
before I forget...

33:03.588 --> 33:06.490
I have something.

33:06.524 --> 33:09.894
Your compass.

33:09.928 --> 33:12.229
Yeah.

33:12.263 --> 33:15.900
Remember the time
we were tracking that buck

33:15.934 --> 33:17.501
up in the Berkshires
and lost track of time?

33:17.535 --> 33:19.002
Mm-hmm.

33:19.036 --> 33:22.605
Sun went down, and we had to
make our way back to camp.

33:22.639 --> 33:24.340
Compass.

33:24.374 --> 33:25.774
Mom was furious.

33:25.808 --> 33:27.776
"You know better than that,
Dan!"

33:27.810 --> 33:29.677
Yeah, well,
she was right.

33:29.711 --> 33:30.945
You know what?
I'm...

33:30.979 --> 33:33.414
I'm sorry.
I think my meds are gonna --

33:33.448 --> 33:36.684
just kicking in.

33:36.718 --> 33:37.951
Hmm.

33:37.986 --> 33:41.655
I'll let you rest.

33:54.334 --> 33:56.668
How's it going?

33:56.703 --> 33:58.537
Quiet.

33:58.605 --> 34:00.605
No sign that the Skitters
followed us.

34:03.608 --> 34:06.743
Look what
I got a hold of.

34:21.757 --> 34:26.460
So, how long's
this been going on?

34:26.495 --> 34:28.596
What?

34:28.630 --> 34:31.297
Come on, Ben.

34:31.331 --> 34:34.833
In the harnessing
facility...

34:34.868 --> 34:37.335
I saw your spikes glow.

34:40.606 --> 34:42.840
You're mistaken.

34:42.873 --> 34:43.974
Really?

34:44.009 --> 34:45.442
That's how
you want to play this?

34:45.476 --> 34:46.777
You're just gonna lie
about it?

34:46.811 --> 34:48.978
Hope it goes away
instead of getting worse?

34:49.013 --> 34:50.380
Yes!

34:50.415 --> 34:53.884
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

34:53.918 --> 34:55.886
Who here is gonna understand
glowing spikes?

34:55.920 --> 35:01.625
Half of these people still think
I killed Jimmy.

35:01.659 --> 35:04.360
You can rat me out
if you want,

35:04.394 --> 35:07.495
but I am not signing
my own death warrant.

35:07.530 --> 35:10.899
And I am your brother.

35:10.933 --> 35:13.834
And all I'm trying to do
is help.

35:13.869 --> 35:16.971
I know.

35:17.005 --> 35:21.641
But you need to back off.

35:45.914 --> 35:47.148
Uh...

35:47.182 --> 35:49.282
You want to see me,
boss?

35:49.316 --> 35:51.985
Yes, I did.

35:52.052 --> 35:54.887
That's the unit's laundry.
I want you to wash it.

35:54.921 --> 35:57.422
Yes, sir.

35:57.457 --> 35:59.191
When you're finished
with that,

35:59.225 --> 36:01.559
you can stop by the armory tent
and pick up the Barrett rifle.

36:01.594 --> 36:04.161
I'm putting you back
on sniper duty.

36:04.195 --> 36:05.462
Yes, sir.

36:05.497 --> 36:08.031
I want you to do something
for me, though.

36:08.065 --> 36:10.166
Keep Boon in line.

36:10.201 --> 36:12.302
Don't you worry, boss.

36:12.337 --> 36:15.572
He step out of line, I'll put
my boot so far up his butt

36:15.606 --> 36:16.673
he'll taste shoe leather.

36:40.296 --> 36:44.131
What's going on, Lo?

36:47.534 --> 36:51.169
Why don't you let me in on it?
Maybe I could help.

36:58.310 --> 37:03.013
I had an aunt and uncle
in Parras.

37:03.047 --> 37:06.282
It's this tiny town

37:06.317 --> 37:10.386
in the middle of nowhere,
Northern Mexico.

37:10.454 --> 37:12.388
And I-I always ask
new people

37:12.456 --> 37:15.291
if they've heard any news
of survivors.

37:15.325 --> 37:17.159
Okay.

37:19.228 --> 37:22.464
And I asked Diego...

37:22.498 --> 37:25.234
and he said
it was wiped out.

37:27.271 --> 37:30.240
And of course it is,
you know?

37:30.274 --> 37:34.676
I don't know why I was hoping
they'd somehow survived.

37:36.279 --> 37:39.113
I'm an idiot.

37:39.148 --> 37:41.115
Lo, you're not an idiot.

37:41.150 --> 37:43.984
And -- and I'm sorry
about your family,

37:44.018 --> 37:48.355
but...it doesn't mean
you stop hoping,

37:48.389 --> 37:51.524
it just means you got to hope
for something else.

37:52.793 --> 37:55.361
You know, for Charleston.

37:55.395 --> 38:00.166
For a new life one day,
a new family.

38:04.037 --> 38:06.705
Hope's all we got.

39:31.878 --> 39:34.847
"Dad, I'm sorry.

39:34.881 --> 39:37.849
"But I'm not coming with you
to Charleston.

39:37.883 --> 39:39.851
"I said some terrible things,

39:39.885 --> 39:42.720
"but I want you to know this
has nothing to do with that.

39:42.755 --> 39:47.324
"I have my own life now
with Diego and the other kids.

39:47.358 --> 39:49.426
"And while I'd love to come
with you,

39:49.460 --> 39:53.564
"I know that they need me
like the 2nd Mass needs you.

39:53.598 --> 39:56.299
"I'm sorry to say goodbye
this way.

39:56.334 --> 39:58.302
"But if I told you in person,

39:58.336 --> 40:01.438
"we both know
you'd never let me go.

40:01.472 --> 40:03.440
"I love you, papa bear.

40:03.474 --> 40:08.544
Always and forever,
baby bear."
