00:45.479 --> 00:46.614
MAN:
Sir?

00:48.382 --> 00:50.084
MAN:
Sir

00:50.084 --> 00:53.287
You... you can't
be out here.

00:53.287 --> 00:55.289
Sir?

00:55.289 --> 00:56.657
Sir?

00:56.657 --> 00:57.625
It's not safe.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.693
Sir?

00:59.693 --> 01:01.429
Sir, you can't be here.

01:03.464 --> 01:04.565
Sir?

01:08.302 --> 01:10.371
They found some guy
wandering and disoriented.

01:10.371 --> 01:12.706
Oh, just what we need--
another lost soul.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.375
You can never have
enough of them.

01:14.375 --> 01:15.776
Nate Lennox, 54.

01:15.776 --> 01:17.245
Medic Alert bracelet
says he's ALS.

01:17.245 --> 01:18.646
Paralyzed and
unresponsive.

01:18.646 --> 01:20.648
He rolled out onto the ice
at Prospect Rink.

01:20.648 --> 01:22.150
Somebody with him?

01:22.150 --> 01:23.184
Uh, called the number
on the bracelet.

01:23.184 --> 01:24.185
Left a message.

01:24.185 --> 01:25.853
Mr. Lennox,
can you hear me?

01:25.853 --> 01:27.688
How did he get
out of the house?

01:27.688 --> 01:29.290
Good question.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.758
Do you think
he was abandoned?

01:30.758 --> 01:31.659
Somebody's taking
care of this guy.

01:31.659 --> 01:33.161
He's got clean clothes

01:33.161 --> 01:34.495
and it looks like
he had a shave this morning.

01:34.495 --> 01:36.164
Pulse ox is only 89.

01:36.164 --> 01:38.166
Let's get him
on five liters by mask. Okay.

01:38.166 --> 01:40.368
Gonna need some
lifting help.

01:40.368 --> 01:42.203
No, no, no, let's just leave him
in the chair for now.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.172
If we lay him down,
it might compress his lungs.

01:44.172 --> 01:45.506
It might make things worse.

01:45.506 --> 01:48.609
Okay,
crackles bilaterally.

01:48.609 --> 01:52.413
CBC, chem panel
and a portable chest.

01:52.413 --> 01:55.216
Let's call for
his old medical records.

01:55.216 --> 01:56.517
Whoa!

01:56.517 --> 01:58.586
( grunting ):
Hey, hey.

01:58.586 --> 02:00.321
What? Did you hit
the joystick?

02:00.321 --> 02:01.589
No.

02:01.589 --> 02:04.625
Okay. Sats are up to 92.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.495
Have RT induce a sputum
for a gram stain

02:07.495 --> 02:08.496
and culture.

02:08.496 --> 02:10.298
Okay. Whoa! Hey.

02:10.298 --> 02:11.465
Don't do that.

02:11.465 --> 02:12.700
I didn't touch it.

02:12.700 --> 02:13.834
Is there a short
or something?

02:16.270 --> 02:18.439
I think the computer
has an eye sensor

02:18.439 --> 02:19.773
that's controlling the chair.

02:19.773 --> 02:21.309
I think he wants
to get out of here.

02:21.309 --> 02:23.277
He's probably altered
from too low oxygen.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.445
Yeah, well, I'm...

02:24.445 --> 02:26.447
I'm gonna disconnect
the battery.

02:26.447 --> 02:27.815
Need a hand?

02:27.815 --> 02:29.517
ALS with pneumonia.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.419
Could use a hep lock.

02:31.419 --> 02:32.453
What's his name?

02:32.453 --> 02:34.222
Nate Lennox.

02:34.222 --> 02:36.224
I've seen him before,
a while back.

02:39.460 --> 02:40.428
SYNTHESIZED VOICE:
No.

02:40.428 --> 02:42.363
Help. Don't.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.432
He did that with his eyes?

02:44.432 --> 02:47.601
Well, looks like
a speech synthesizer program.

02:47.601 --> 02:49.370
It's okay now, sir.

02:49.370 --> 02:50.938
We're gonna take care of you.

02:50.938 --> 02:55.909
Want out.
Please, let me out.

02:55.909 --> 02:58.446
Please,

02:58.446 --> 03:00.881
let me out.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.838
Sats are
still borderline.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.440
I'm not sure
how aggressive

03:59.440 --> 04:00.841
we need to be
with this guy.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.343
Is he a DNR?

04:02.343 --> 04:05.346
If I were like that,
I sure as hell would be.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.518
Mr. Lennox, your oxygen
levels are falling.

04:10.518 --> 04:11.819
Do you understand?

04:16.824 --> 04:20.394
We need to know your wishes
about resuscitation.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.698
Okay.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.669
Home...

04:28.669 --> 04:30.738
Does that mean you don't
want heroic measures?

04:30.738 --> 04:33.040
Home.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.842
If you stop breathing,

04:34.842 --> 04:36.777
do you want us to use
a machine,

04:36.777 --> 04:38.679
a ventilator?

04:38.679 --> 04:39.780
Hungry...

04:39.780 --> 04:42.082
Food.

04:42.082 --> 04:44.418
SAM:
Do you have
a living will?

04:44.418 --> 04:46.354
An advanced
directive?

04:48.822 --> 04:51.959
Drug store.
I don't think
we're getting through to him.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.461
Do you know
where you are?

04:58.499 --> 05:00.568
I have amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis,

05:00.568 --> 05:03.571
also known
as Lou Gehrig's Disease.

05:03.571 --> 05:07.408
It is a progressive degenerative
neurologic disorder

05:07.408 --> 05:08.609
that has weakened my muscles.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.944
All of my senses are intact.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.546
My mind is clear.

05:12.546 --> 05:13.847
Not today, it isn't.

05:13.847 --> 05:16.484
Got his old records.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.118
We need the name
of his neurologist.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.120
Maybe he'll know
what to do with this one.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.423
You want me
to up his oxygen?

05:22.423 --> 05:24.425
I'm gonna say
let's go with BiPap.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.694
It'll buy us time
without having to intubate.

05:26.694 --> 05:27.928
I knew he
looked familiar.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.930
What?
He should already be on BiPap.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.799
Neela and I treated him
about a year ago.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.401
He came in for
shortness of breath.

05:33.401 --> 05:35.669
NATE:
Every time you have a thought,

05:35.669 --> 05:41.041
every time you take a breath,

05:41.041 --> 05:46.146
every time you move a muscle,

05:46.146 --> 05:49.917
every time you take a crap...

05:49.917 --> 05:51.885
( chuckling )

05:54.755 --> 05:57.525
...you should thank your ATP...
AT... ATP.

06:00.761 --> 06:03.597
Oxidative phosphorylation...

06:07.167 --> 06:10.871
( inhaling )

06:10.871 --> 06:12.606
gives...

06:14.942 --> 06:16.944
gives us...

06:19.447 --> 06:21.449
a whopping...

06:21.449 --> 06:23.751
SAM:
The bedpan may distort
things a little.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.185
Hoo, boy.

06:25.185 --> 06:29.122
The kids at school are going
to make fun of me.

06:31.492 --> 06:32.660
This too tight?
No, It's fine.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.665
It's like
an oven in here.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.567
I'm sorry, they're working
on the A/C.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.902
So hot...

06:41.902 --> 06:46.073
The BiPap increases
your tidal volume.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.741
Your neurologist says it'll
give you more energy

06:47.741 --> 06:49.009
and a longer survival.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.544
That's great news.

06:50.544 --> 06:53.747
Sam, labs were hemolyzed
on your heat stroke guy.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.817
I'll be right back.
I'll wait here.

06:56.817 --> 06:59.186
I should have another listen.

07:03.190 --> 07:05.893
Where'd you go
to med school?

07:05.893 --> 07:07.628
Um, right here.

07:07.628 --> 07:12.132
I was a Biochemistry major
at Yale,

07:12.132 --> 07:13.967
so I placed out of your class.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.636
Yale...

07:15.636 --> 07:18.539
I worked in Sandra Hamilton's
lab my senior year.

07:18.539 --> 07:19.540
Yeah, I know.

07:20.874 --> 07:25.713
We were in awe of your work
on anti-sense RNA.

07:25.713 --> 07:27.581
I cited several
of your studies

07:27.581 --> 07:29.249
in my paper
on gene inactivation

07:29.249 --> 07:30.851
in Trypanosoma brucei.

07:30.851 --> 07:35.723
You published
as an undergraduate?

07:35.723 --> 07:37.691
Second author.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.993
Impressive.

07:39.993 --> 07:43.531
So what are you
doing here

07:43.531 --> 07:45.899
in this,
uh, cesspool?

07:45.899 --> 07:50.037
Are you just here
for the big bucks?

07:50.037 --> 07:54.174
What is it
going to be?

07:54.174 --> 07:57.277
Orthopedics?

07:57.277 --> 08:00.013
Plastic surgery?

08:00.013 --> 08:02.049
Neither.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.251
I... can't stand
surgeons.

08:04.251 --> 08:07.087
They're arrogant
workaholics

08:07.087 --> 08:08.789
who can't relate to people
unless they're asleep.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.991
WOMAN:
Sorry, Nate.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.126
The car overheated
and I had to take the El.

08:13.126 --> 08:14.628
What happened?

08:14.628 --> 08:15.829
I'm fine.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.565
He had some shortness
of breath.

08:17.565 --> 08:18.632
I'm Dr. Rasgotra.

08:18.632 --> 08:19.767
Uh, Fran Bevens...

08:19.767 --> 08:20.901
Did you reach Dr. Ames?

08:20.901 --> 08:22.736
He's already
been down.
Okay.

08:22.736 --> 08:26.974
He's consulting
a speech pathologist.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.175
Good.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.210
Not good.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.645
I don't need it.

08:31.645 --> 08:32.980
It's getting hard for people

08:32.980 --> 08:34.313
to understand
what you're saying, Nate.

08:34.313 --> 08:38.217
Maybe they should start
listening better.

08:40.988 --> 08:42.022
Hello, Fran.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.592
Jared... it's good
to see you.

08:47.094 --> 08:49.162
Ready to start?

08:49.162 --> 08:52.800
I'm trying to contain
my enthusiasm.

08:52.800 --> 08:53.901
How long are you guys
going to be?

08:53.901 --> 08:56.103
Half an hour.
15 minutes.

08:56.103 --> 08:57.971
We'll be back with your
aftercare instructions.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.072
You...

08:59.072 --> 09:01.241
think about

09:01.241 --> 09:03.644
what you're doing.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.313
You may realize

09:06.313 --> 09:09.817
you don't... belong here.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.121
Where does he think
you belong?

09:14.121 --> 09:15.355
Probably back
at the Jumbo Mart.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.858
I think he misses
my slushies.

09:17.858 --> 09:19.860
Please be kind.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.294
Hey, severe sunburn.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.163
Dispo if the pain's down
with toradol and aloe.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.364
Not too bad.

09:24.364 --> 09:25.966
Soft rule out
going to tele...

09:25.966 --> 09:28.769
Excellent.
And this guy's
with his PMD,

09:28.769 --> 09:29.837
so there's nothing
for you to do.

09:29.837 --> 09:31.672
Lennox?
Is that Nate Lennox?

09:31.672 --> 09:33.073
Yeah, the biochemistry
professor.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.174
Oh, wait,
I've got one more.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.676
Yeah, I'll figure
it out.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.378
Nate...

09:38.378 --> 09:41.915
Do you like
my new look?

09:41.915 --> 09:43.751
Well, not a lot of people
could pull that off.

09:43.751 --> 09:44.952
Good to see you,
Abby.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.386
Hi, Fran.
Whatcha doing?

09:46.386 --> 09:51.124
Playing Medal of Honor.

09:51.124 --> 09:54.662
I just killed
a convoy of Nazis.

09:54.662 --> 09:56.129
AMES:
His facial muscles
are weakening,

09:56.129 --> 09:59.299
he needs to practice
with assisted speech.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.669
SYNTHESIZED VOICE:
Hey, I've got a great idea...

10:05.072 --> 10:07.140
Oops.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.910
AMES:
Well, we can wait
on speech therapy

10:09.910 --> 10:13.346
for the time being, but I
got to tell you, Nate--

10:13.346 --> 10:15.683
you're just putting off
the inevitable.

10:15.683 --> 10:17.985
You need
to start wearing this.
Why?

10:17.985 --> 10:20.420
Because it has your diagnosis
on it and your name

10:20.420 --> 10:22.422
and your
phone number.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.057
We're lucky you were
in class today.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.425
Otherwise, who knows what might
have happened?

10:25.425 --> 10:26.927
Huh?

10:26.927 --> 10:30.363
Okay, okay.

10:30.363 --> 10:32.733
How about this thing?

10:32.733 --> 10:35.168
Do I have to wear it
all the time?

10:35.168 --> 10:37.705
AMES:
Well, we'll start with
bedtime use.

10:37.705 --> 10:39.072
You'll get the benefits
of eight hours a night

10:39.072 --> 10:40.941
while you're asleep.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.979
I keep waking up...

10:45.979 --> 10:48.749
and something else is gone.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.287
Thank God for the bracelet.

10:54.287 --> 10:55.956
Is that comfortable?

10:55.956 --> 10:57.791
Nate. Nate.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.392
He was speaking with
the computer

10:59.392 --> 11:00.861
when he first came in.

11:00.861 --> 11:02.162
Can't get an IV in him.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.097
He always needs
a central line.

11:04.097 --> 11:06.299
He was at an ice rink?

11:06.299 --> 11:07.935
Yeah. Any idea why?

11:07.935 --> 11:10.470
It was like any other day.

11:10.470 --> 11:13.874
I got up, I shaved him,
bathed him,

11:13.874 --> 11:16.409
fed him breakfast
and then transferred
him to the chair.

11:16.409 --> 11:19.980
He was watching television,
so I went to take a quick nap.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.381
How did he
get outside?

11:21.381 --> 11:23.250
He can open the front door
with his computer.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.385
Ray, ready to present?

11:25.385 --> 11:27.420
Yeah.
Dr. Kovac.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.222
Fran Bevens.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.124
Hello. Hello, sir.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.160
FRAN:
You saw him
a few years ago.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.428
Right middle and lower lobe
infiltrates.

11:35.428 --> 11:39.366
He's altered, borderline
oxygenation, even with BiPap.

11:39.366 --> 11:40.968
Can we have a word?

11:40.968 --> 11:42.903
Yes, of course.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.777
We, uh, may need
to make a decision

11:49.777 --> 11:53.180
about intubating
and ventilation.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.983
You think he can get over
the pneumonia?

11:55.983 --> 11:57.785
BARNETT:
He could,

11:57.785 --> 11:59.052
or he could be intubated
in the ICU,

11:59.052 --> 12:00.320
going downhill
for four weeks.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.422
TAGGART:
He hasn't got a lot
of reserve.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.124
There's no guarantee
he'll get better.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.893
This may be

12:05.893 --> 12:08.195
the natural end point
of his disease.

12:08.195 --> 12:11.231
So maybe it's time to focus
on keeping him comfortable.

12:12.499 --> 12:13.801
Fran, I just heard
you were here.

12:13.801 --> 12:14.902
Thank you for
coming by.

12:14.902 --> 12:18.806
I've taken care
of him before.

12:18.806 --> 12:21.174
He decided

12:21.174 --> 12:22.275
to go out
by himself.

12:22.275 --> 12:23.811
Why'd you do that, Nate?

12:27.480 --> 12:30.283
COMPUTER:
In motion.

12:30.283 --> 12:31.418
What's in motion?

12:34.187 --> 12:35.222
Free.

12:36.890 --> 12:39.226
LOCKHART:
His pulse ox is
down to 82.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.460
What are you
doing?

12:40.460 --> 12:42.062
Well, his lungs
are full of junk,

12:42.062 --> 12:43.831
his sats are down,
he needs to be intubated.

12:43.831 --> 12:46.867
Abby, we've been just discussing
about how best to proceed.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.235
Well, helping him breathe

12:48.235 --> 12:49.436
would be a good way to start,
don't you think?

12:49.436 --> 12:51.104
I don't think that
he'd want that, Abby.

12:55.408 --> 12:56.509
Abby...

12:56.509 --> 12:57.577
Yankauer.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.379
We haven't come
to a consensus.

12:59.379 --> 13:02.415
I'm not comfortable
with this.

13:02.415 --> 13:03.851
I'm not intubating.

13:03.851 --> 13:04.885
( hissing and gurgling )

13:06.019 --> 13:08.255
Large mucus plug
at the cords.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.224
Okay, that should help.

13:11.224 --> 13:12.225
Temporarily.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.161
Sats are coming up.

13:14.161 --> 13:16.329
Well, this will give us time
to treat him with

13:16.329 --> 13:18.465
oxygen and antibiotics
until he's alert enough

13:18.465 --> 13:20.467
to tell us what he wants.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.235
Dr. Lennox.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.071
Nate.

13:24.071 --> 13:26.106
Nate, talk to us.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.547
Around... and into
the subclavian.

13:34.547 --> 13:35.916
Fluoro off.

13:35.916 --> 13:36.984
Okay, that's as far
as we go.

13:36.984 --> 13:38.251
Ceftriaxone's ready.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.887
How'd he do?

13:39.887 --> 13:41.521
Very well. We're starting
the IV antibiotics.

13:41.521 --> 13:42.890
When did he
last eat?

13:42.890 --> 13:44.291
I fed him this morning.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.159
He could use
some calories.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.961
How you doing?

13:47.961 --> 13:49.329
You're in the
hospital, Nate.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.431
LOCKHART:
Nate...

13:51.431 --> 13:56.003
You remember when we talked
about putting in a trake

13:56.003 --> 13:58.438
if you had
trouble breathing?

13:58.438 --> 14:00.640
You said you wanted
to keep going

14:00.640 --> 14:03.443
until they found
a stem cell cure.

14:03.443 --> 14:06.013
BARNETT:
Why don't we just
let him rest?

14:06.013 --> 14:08.515
Snowmobile versus tree.
Morris needs some help.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.018
500 of Azithro
after the Rocephin.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.285
Got it.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.354
Okay, we all need
to agree on this.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.424
You told me
you wanted a trake.

14:17.424 --> 14:20.493
FRAN:
That was a long time
ago, Abby.

14:20.493 --> 14:24.932
His biggest fear now is that
he'll end up on life support

14:24.932 --> 14:27.467
aware of everything,
but with no way
to communicate.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.369
He was communicating
a half hour ago, wasn't he?

14:29.369 --> 14:31.504
BARNETT:
That could have been
random eye movements.

14:31.504 --> 14:32.973
400 cc's of Jevity.

14:32.973 --> 14:34.274
Yeah.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.148
So if we do the trake...

14:41.148 --> 14:42.549
LOCKHART:
He's out of here
in a day.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.117
He can go home with
a portable ventilator.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.352
You'd have to learn
how to suction

14:45.352 --> 14:47.520
and troubleshoot
the vent.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.456
But we can get you some help.

14:49.456 --> 14:50.958
I know you're tired.

14:50.958 --> 14:52.525
He's the one
who's tired.

14:52.525 --> 14:53.961
Fran.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.628
I'm with him
every day, Abby.

14:55.628 --> 14:57.164
I know.

14:57.164 --> 14:59.632
Looks like we've got
a clogged G-tube here.

14:59.632 --> 15:02.535
Do you flush it
with water?

15:02.535 --> 15:04.104
Yes, after every feeding.

15:04.104 --> 15:05.305
He needs nutritional support
soon

15:05.305 --> 15:06.706
to fight off the infection.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.976
It won't go.
Do you know when
the tube was put in?

15:08.976 --> 15:10.978
No. I...

15:10.978 --> 15:13.246
G-tube placed
in May, 2002.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.182
He came in after
a choking spell.

15:15.182 --> 15:16.984
( applause )

15:16.984 --> 15:18.718
You know, each May,
the graduating medical students

15:18.718 --> 15:20.653
vote to present
a Teacher of the Year Award.

15:20.653 --> 15:23.223
Now this year's award
is unique.
Fresh flowers.

15:23.223 --> 15:26.393
in that the students
have chosen not a clinician,
They must think it will make up

15:26.393 --> 15:28.361
but rather
a scientist,
for cutting back on my teaching.

15:28.361 --> 15:31.598
whose dynamism
and passion for inquiry

15:31.598 --> 15:34.634
made a strong impression
during their first year

15:34.634 --> 15:36.603
and stayed with the students
throughout their training.

15:36.603 --> 15:39.639
This year it gives
me great pleasure...
( choking )

15:39.639 --> 15:42.642
to present the 2002 Teacher
of the Year Award
Nate, what is it? Nate? Nate?

15:42.642 --> 15:46.046
to Dr. Nathan Lennox.
( gasps )

15:46.046 --> 15:48.548
Well, your chest X-ray
is negative for aspiration.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.350
You got lucky, Nate.

15:50.350 --> 15:53.420
Yeah, I'm the luckiest man
on the face of the Earth.

15:53.420 --> 15:54.454
It's time for
a feeding tube.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.189
No, it's not.

15:56.189 --> 15:57.757
Well, you know your chewing
and swallowing muscles

15:57.757 --> 15:59.759
are getting pretty weak.

15:59.759 --> 16:02.762
Well, then Fran will
have to cut my meat
smaller, won't she?

16:02.762 --> 16:04.264
Takes him an hour
to eat a meal.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.699
He's lost ten pounds.
More like five.

16:06.699 --> 16:09.202
The rest
is water weight.

16:09.202 --> 16:11.438
Weight loss accelerates
the progression of ALS.

16:11.438 --> 16:14.207
The extra calories
from the tube feeding

16:14.207 --> 16:15.642
will mean increased strength,
more energy

16:15.642 --> 16:17.444
and longer survival.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.079
I'll think about it.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.313
Romano around?

16:20.313 --> 16:22.449
He's stuck in the OR
with a pneumonectomy,

16:22.449 --> 16:24.217
but I'll see about
getting you on the schedule.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.386
I said I'll
think about it.

16:26.386 --> 16:27.620
Well, we'll save
you a spot.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.256
We can always cancel.

16:29.256 --> 16:30.457
Good night.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.125
I'll walk out
with you, Donald.

16:32.125 --> 16:34.361
I'll be right back.
Night, guys.
It's been great.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.463
Tell them to send
the trophy
to my mother.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.465
Trophy?

16:38.465 --> 16:40.567
I won the potato sack race
at the county retreat.

16:45.238 --> 16:47.140
Abby Lockhart around?

16:47.140 --> 16:48.508
No, not tonight.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.410
It's pretty quiet
around here.

16:50.410 --> 16:53.146
Sometimes it's slow.

16:53.146 --> 16:55.248
It's not just that.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.184
Are you cutting back
on staff or something?

16:57.184 --> 17:00.253
One of our attendings died.

17:00.253 --> 17:01.554
Mark Greene.

17:01.554 --> 17:04.156
A lot of people took off
to go to his memorial.

17:04.156 --> 17:06.358
Chen wants you in Exam Three
with the belly pain guy.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.627
It's a slam-dunk
diverticulitis.

17:08.627 --> 17:10.730
I called medicine--
all she has to do
is co-sign my chart.

17:10.730 --> 17:13.366
I'll let you tell
her that yourself.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.540
What year residency
you in?

17:21.540 --> 17:23.843
First. I'm an intern.

17:23.843 --> 17:27.114
Ooh, pretty cocky
for an intern,
aren't you, huh?

17:27.114 --> 17:31.451
You're either real smart
or really insecure.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.220
If I were you, I'd put
my money on the first one.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.554
Of course, 'cause all
the great minds

17:34.554 --> 17:36.289
want to work
in the County E.R.

17:36.289 --> 17:40.127
Actually, this is
just temporary.

17:40.127 --> 17:41.661
Planning on moving over
to Northwestern soon.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.697
Congratulations.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.133
Got in, huh?

17:46.133 --> 17:47.834
Well, not yet, but believe me,
I will.

17:47.834 --> 17:50.403
JARVIK:
Pre-op instructions
for the G-tube.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.805
Okay, cool.
All right,
listen up.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.874
This is going to show you
everything you need to know

17:54.874 --> 17:57.210
about the procedure:
where to show up,

17:57.210 --> 17:59.512
what to eat
the night before,
what to wear...

17:59.512 --> 18:00.647
( sobs gently )

18:00.647 --> 18:03.583
Uh... are you okay?

18:04.751 --> 18:09.156
Look, I know it's hard.

18:09.156 --> 18:10.290
This isn't me.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.659
It's the disease.

18:12.659 --> 18:15.562
Okay. The nerve deterioration
leads to pseudobulbar affect.

18:15.562 --> 18:17.464
His emotions can be
very exaggerated.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.466
Yeah, I see.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.301
Okay, shh, shh.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.570
It's called emotional
incontinence.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.538
It sucks.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.307
You get a little
upset about something,

18:27.307 --> 18:29.376
and the next thing
you're crying like a baby.

18:29.376 --> 18:32.745
Well, there has to be some sort
of medicine for that.

18:32.745 --> 18:34.214
FRAN:
He won't take it.

18:34.214 --> 18:36.483
NATE:
Side effects
are too much.

18:36.483 --> 18:40.420
And it's the BDNF...

18:40.420 --> 18:43.856
I've been injecting
Nerve Growth Factor

18:43.856 --> 18:46.793
twice a day
for a year.

18:46.793 --> 18:50.397
Stuff turns ALS mice

18:50.397 --> 18:51.664
into Olympic athletes,

18:51.664 --> 18:54.201
but the human trials--
worthless.

18:54.201 --> 18:55.535
Results haven't
panned out in humans.

18:55.535 --> 18:56.803
I'm sorry to hear that.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.905
Now Fran has to pour...

18:58.905 --> 19:01.508
Ensure in my stomach
tube all day long.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.576
FRAN:
It's no big deal.
Shh. Come on.

19:03.576 --> 19:05.712
Come on.
Calm down.
I just...

19:05.712 --> 19:08.715
didn't want to be
a burden on anyone.
Shh. Come on.

19:08.715 --> 19:11.884
( sobbing )
Come on.

19:11.884 --> 19:14.621
FRAN:
Should this
be hurting him?

19:14.621 --> 19:16.289
Maybe just
a little.

19:16.289 --> 19:18.858
Okay, G-tube is in.

19:18.858 --> 19:22.229
Balloon is up.
Check the flow.

19:22.229 --> 19:23.930
I think he's
waking up a little bit.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.498
Go ahead and set up
for PFT's.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.799
The flow's looking good.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.568
Thank you.

19:28.568 --> 19:31.604
All right, we need
to test his lung function.

19:31.604 --> 19:35.242
Nate, I'm going to put this
in your mouth

19:35.242 --> 19:37.544
and Sam's going
to pinch your nose.

19:37.544 --> 19:40.447
Here we go.

19:40.447 --> 19:42.482
Easy. All right.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.520
Easy.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.955
Okay...

19:48.955 --> 19:52.792
All right, deep breath in.

19:52.792 --> 19:55.462
( wheezing breath )

19:55.462 --> 19:56.796
And blow it out.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.931
Blow it out,
blow it out.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.333
Great.

20:00.333 --> 20:03.670
Forced vital capacity
is 32% of normal.

20:03.670 --> 20:06.706
That's the amount
of air that he can move...
I know what it means.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.808
Okay.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.210
Nate...

20:13.713 --> 20:15.348
Nate.

20:15.348 --> 20:18.418
Your lung capacity
has deteriorated.

20:20.019 --> 20:22.989
The best way
to help your breathing

20:22.989 --> 20:24.991
is for us to put in
a trake.

20:24.991 --> 20:27.494
You're going to need
assisted ventilation.

20:27.494 --> 20:28.328
Do you want us
to do it?

20:31.030 --> 20:33.866
I'm not sure you'll
recover without it.

20:33.866 --> 20:35.435
The trake is
the best chance you have

20:35.435 --> 20:39.606
of clearing up
your pneumonia.

20:39.606 --> 20:41.508
Nate...

20:47.347 --> 20:48.948
Okay.

20:48.948 --> 20:50.483
Okay.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.719
Call Surgery.
He consented
to the procedure.

20:52.719 --> 20:54.421
I'm okay.

20:54.421 --> 20:56.323
Abby, I don't think that
that's what he meant.

20:56.323 --> 20:59.326
What? He said, "okay."

20:59.326 --> 21:00.593
He said "I'm okay,"
after that,

21:00.593 --> 21:01.761
which could mean
leave him alone.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.530
It's not exactly
informed consent.

21:03.530 --> 21:06.433
Nate, you want
the trake, don't you?

21:06.433 --> 21:08.868
I don't... you all heard
what he said.

21:08.868 --> 21:12.672
At a vital capacity of 30%,
some ALS patients

21:12.672 --> 21:14.441
enter into hospice care.

21:14.441 --> 21:16.643
It means they have
six months to live.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.511
His FVC is low, yes, but that's
because of the pneumonia.

21:18.511 --> 21:20.347
We clear that up,
and his lung function

21:20.347 --> 21:21.781
will bounce right back.
That's the best
case scenario.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.716
He expressed his wishes
in advance.

21:23.716 --> 21:25.785
Now he's too sick.
He can't give
reliable consent.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.654
How's his PO2?
I want to do
a trake.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.489
We have a consent
issue here.

21:29.489 --> 21:30.723
I explained the procedure
to the patient.

21:30.723 --> 21:32.792
I asked him if he wanted
us to do it.

21:32.792 --> 21:33.693
he said, "okay,"
on his computer.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.061
KOVAC:
He did?

21:35.061 --> 21:36.663
He also said, "I'm okay,"
after that.

21:36.663 --> 21:38.565
I don't think
that he understood.

21:38.565 --> 21:40.467
LOCKHART:
He was alert

21:40.467 --> 21:42.369
and looking at me
the entire time.
He understood.

21:42.369 --> 21:43.836
I really don't think that this

21:43.836 --> 21:45.872
is what
he wants.

21:45.872 --> 21:48.741
Fran has
a durable power of attorney.

21:48.741 --> 21:49.942
Thank you.
It's your call.

21:52.812 --> 21:53.846
You know, with
all due respect,

21:53.846 --> 21:54.947
I'm sorry, but...

21:54.947 --> 21:56.583
Nate expressed

21:56.583 --> 21:59.386
his wishes, and I think
we have to go with that.

22:01.053 --> 22:05.091
Well, if there's a chance that
he asked for the procedure...

22:05.091 --> 22:06.993
I'm not sure that he did.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.928
I think we have to do it.

22:08.928 --> 22:10.697
Dr. Kovac...

22:10.697 --> 22:12.565
Ray, I need you next door
to help me with a central line.

22:12.565 --> 22:13.566
Let's go.

22:16.403 --> 22:17.704
I'd like to page
Dr. Ames.

22:17.704 --> 22:19.138
I'll try to find him.

22:19.138 --> 22:22.642
And call Dubenko to put
in the trash

22:22.642 --> 22:24.411
and RT to set up a vent.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.523
Between the first and second
tracheal rings.
Dr. Lennox,

22:36.523 --> 22:38.558
close your eyes
if you're having any pain.

22:38.558 --> 22:40.059
Doesn't look like
he's feeling anything.

22:40.059 --> 22:42.495
Aspirate air,
confirm you're in.
Guidewire.

22:42.495 --> 22:44.096
So you're in surgery
now, Neela?

22:44.096 --> 22:46.132
I'm just doing an elective.

22:46.132 --> 22:48.468
Well, things change, right?

22:48.468 --> 22:50.036
Certainly do.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.170
11 French dilator.

22:51.170 --> 22:52.505
Balloon's good to go.

22:52.505 --> 22:54.874
I hope he's okay
with this.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.143
Mm.

22:57.143 --> 22:58.445
Doesn't want to pass.

22:58.445 --> 23:00.847
A little more muscle.

23:00.847 --> 23:02.649
( soft gasps )

23:02.649 --> 23:04.150
You doing all right, Nate?

23:04.150 --> 23:06.185
DUBENKO:
Okay, remove the dilator.

23:06.185 --> 23:07.854
Slide the trake
tube in.

23:07.854 --> 23:09.055
Mm.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.990
Bit of oozing here.

23:10.990 --> 23:13.025
Direct pressure should
take care of that.

23:13.025 --> 23:14.561
Little bit of bleeding
can be normal.

23:14.561 --> 23:15.562
Tachy at 130.

23:15.562 --> 23:17.096
I'll open up his fluids.

23:17.096 --> 23:20.132
Is he okay?
Um, he could be sensitive
to the blood loss.

23:20.132 --> 23:22.469
Let's take another look.

23:22.469 --> 23:24.003
Oh, my God.
Pressure again.

23:24.003 --> 23:26.005
Ten blade.
What are you doing?

23:26.005 --> 23:28.207
Converting to an open procedure.
We need deep hemostasis.

23:28.207 --> 23:29.809
Two units of packed cells.

23:29.809 --> 23:31.043
A blood transfusion?
It's just a precaution.

23:31.043 --> 23:33.112
Call for type specific.

23:33.112 --> 23:35.114
And, Sam, can you see
if his antibody screen
is in the old chart?

23:35.114 --> 23:36.749
Okay, Abby, grab a Yankauer.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.918
What is happening?
It's just a minor complication.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.987
It doesn't look minor.
ABBY:
Suction on high.

23:40.987 --> 23:43.122
I never should've
let you do this.
Mosquito clamp.

23:43.122 --> 23:44.957
Antibody screen's negative.

23:47.727 --> 23:49.028
He looks like he's in pain--
you guys might

23:49.028 --> 23:50.129
need to give
him some pain medication.

23:50.129 --> 23:50.997
Four of morphine.

23:50.997 --> 23:52.865
No. No morphine.

23:52.865 --> 23:54.501
Yeah, don't give him morphine,
he had a bad reaction

23:54.501 --> 23:55.768
in 2001 when he came in
with a broken wrist.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.937
But the transgene
will be suppressed.

23:57.937 --> 24:00.206
We'll use two
fluorescent reporters
with different spectra.

24:00.206 --> 24:02.509
Why two?
One for transfected cells

24:02.509 --> 24:03.976
and one for
translational fusion

24:03.976 --> 24:06.012
with the target gene.

24:06.012 --> 24:08.915
That's brilliant.
Well, it's simple.
I don't know if it's...

24:11.651 --> 24:14.153
( groaning ):
Oh... ow!

24:14.153 --> 24:15.922
Four morphine.

24:15.922 --> 24:18.758
Get back to work
on the plasmid DNA vectors.
Right now?

24:18.758 --> 24:21.027
I don't want Gregorio
beating us to the Nobel Prize.

24:21.027 --> 24:22.995
KOVAC:
Right.

24:22.995 --> 24:25.197
You know that
you're not supposed
to take the stairs.

24:25.197 --> 24:26.966
They were servicing
one of the elevators.

24:26.966 --> 24:29.836
So you wait
for the next one.
We were late, Fran.

24:29.836 --> 24:31.871
All right. Listen, I...
I've canceled your
morning classes.

24:31.871 --> 24:34.006
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would you do that?

24:34.006 --> 24:36.142
I couldn't get ahold
of Baker, and he's
the only one...

24:36.142 --> 24:38.878
Baker doesn't...
Uh, what did
he say?

24:38.878 --> 24:41.948
Uh, he thinks it's time
to start using a wheelchair.

24:41.948 --> 24:44.283
You've got to be kidding.

24:44.283 --> 24:46.786
The weakness in your legs
is progressing to the point

24:46.786 --> 24:49.188
that it's not safe.
Next time you could
break your hip.

24:49.188 --> 24:50.923
They have power wheelchairs,

24:50.923 --> 24:52.559
motorized scooters.

24:52.559 --> 24:54.561
You-you'll still be
very independent.

24:54.561 --> 24:56.195
Until my battery goes dead.

24:56.195 --> 24:57.997
You won't be losing something,

24:57.997 --> 25:00.700
you will be conserving energy
so you can do more things.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.168
You're trying to turn me
into an invalid.

25:03.636 --> 25:07.073
People with
degenerative diseases

25:07.073 --> 25:08.775
do best when...
when they have...

25:08.775 --> 25:09.642
What?

25:09.642 --> 25:10.643
Hope?

25:11.911 --> 25:13.079
Do you read the paper?

25:13.079 --> 25:15.214
Bush just banned federal funding

25:15.214 --> 25:17.149
for embryonic stem cell
research.

25:17.149 --> 25:20.019
I am trying to hold on
to hope, Doctor...

25:20.019 --> 25:23.122
but nobody's cooperating
these days.

25:26.158 --> 25:28.695
Well, Dr. Ames
has some papers

25:28.695 --> 25:30.162
on mobility assist
devices for...

25:30.162 --> 25:32.198
I don't want 'em.

25:32.198 --> 25:35.001
I'll-I'll go pick
them up. Thank you.
Not for me.

25:35.001 --> 25:37.003
Not for me.

25:38.938 --> 25:40.607
( sighs )

25:40.607 --> 25:42.609
( groans ):
Ow!

25:42.609 --> 25:46.078
So Fran drives you to
all your doctor visits.

25:46.078 --> 25:48.047
Mostly she just
drives me crazy.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.281
Ow, wow...

25:49.281 --> 25:50.683
How long have
you been together?

25:53.252 --> 25:54.854
We're not together.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.656
She works for me.

25:56.656 --> 25:57.790
Oh.
Yeah.

25:57.790 --> 25:58.791
For some time now?

26:00.793 --> 26:03.029
15 years.

26:03.029 --> 26:04.764
She was right out of college.

26:04.764 --> 26:07.333
I needed an assistant
who was on the ball.

26:07.333 --> 26:10.269
She was ridiculously
overqualified.

26:10.269 --> 26:11.804
Only thing that
really surprised me

26:11.804 --> 26:14.373
is that she stayed
after that first year.

26:14.373 --> 26:16.643
She could've gone
to law school,

26:16.643 --> 26:19.111
to business school...

26:19.111 --> 26:21.714
I have to say,
she stuck with me.

26:21.714 --> 26:23.115
She knows you pretty well.

26:23.115 --> 26:25.251
I think that's why
I assumed...

26:25.251 --> 26:28.655
you guys were...
No, no. No, no, no.
( chuckles )

26:31.157 --> 26:35.127
There was a point...

26:35.127 --> 26:38.297
a million years ago...

26:38.297 --> 26:41.668
when it almost happened.

26:43.670 --> 26:46.338
But then I came to my senses.

26:46.338 --> 26:48.007
You married?

26:48.007 --> 26:50.276
Then you understand.

26:50.276 --> 26:54.246
Who has time for family when
you're devoted to your work?

26:54.246 --> 26:57.784
Well, some people try
for a balance.

26:57.784 --> 26:59.318
Maybe if you're an E.R. doc.

26:59.318 --> 27:00.820
But if you're trying

27:00.820 --> 27:02.955
to push back
the frontiers of science,

27:02.955 --> 27:04.691
it's 24/7.

27:04.691 --> 27:06.192
Right.

27:08.027 --> 27:12.965
It's not bad
to be married to your career.

27:12.965 --> 27:16.035
My career is
a good companion.

27:16.035 --> 27:19.238
Never nags me.

27:19.238 --> 27:21.040
Whoa.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.809
( gagging )
You okay?

27:24.076 --> 27:26.012
( loud groan )

27:26.012 --> 27:27.714
Side effect of
the morphine.

27:27.714 --> 27:29.716
That's good to know.

27:29.716 --> 27:31.183
This will make
you feel better.

27:31.183 --> 27:33.219
Two of versed.

27:33.219 --> 27:35.421
That should settle him down.
Sats are only 89.

27:35.421 --> 27:37.824
Maybe we've done enough.
We need to find the
source of the bleeding.

27:37.824 --> 27:39.792
And what if you can't?
We may have
to split open his chest,

27:39.792 --> 27:41.327
but we'll find it.
Damn it!

27:41.327 --> 27:43.830
It's a detour, Fran--
we can get back on track.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.231
You don't know that.
If you'd like,

27:45.231 --> 27:47.133
I can take you out
to the family room.

27:47.133 --> 27:48.801
No!
Okay.

27:48.801 --> 27:50.937
Stay there and hold his
hand and talk with him.

27:50.937 --> 27:53.072
Vascular clamp
and pickups.
Frazier tip suction.

27:53.072 --> 27:54.941
Nate, I am so sorry.
Careful, careful.

27:54.941 --> 27:57.476
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Right there.

27:57.476 --> 27:59.345
( groans )

27:59.345 --> 28:00.813
Deep to the
manubrium.

28:00.813 --> 28:02.849
I think you've got it.

28:02.849 --> 28:05.051
My, oh, my.
What?

28:05.051 --> 28:06.753
We poked through the
left innominate vein.

28:06.753 --> 28:08.187
I've never seen
anything like that.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.056
RASGOTRA:
Very unusual anatomy.

28:10.056 --> 28:12.158
Well, when they made Nate,
they broke the mold.

28:12.158 --> 28:14.894
Sats are coming up,
B.P. 120/75.

28:14.894 --> 28:16.929
Okay, we're out of the woods.
Good.

28:16.929 --> 28:19.766
Trake's in, vent tubing.

28:19.766 --> 28:22.201
Four-oh prolene.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.771
You gave us
a little scare there.

28:24.771 --> 28:27.039
Let me help you.
You're not gonna be
needing this anymore.

28:32.344 --> 28:35.314
Nate.

28:35.314 --> 28:37.216
RASGOTRA:
Dr. Lennox, open your eyes.

28:39.251 --> 28:41.420
Could just be
because of the sedative.

28:41.420 --> 28:44.523
Um, there might be some damage.

28:44.523 --> 28:46.859
RASGOTRA:
The blood loss may have
deprived the brain

28:46.859 --> 28:49.962
of oxygen.

28:49.962 --> 28:53.032
Pass the tubing
all the way...

28:53.032 --> 28:55.935
and cover the suction port
with your thumb.

28:55.935 --> 28:58.971
( wheezing, coughing )
Then pull out slowly.

28:58.971 --> 29:00.807
It's making him cough.

29:00.807 --> 29:03.009
That's good-- it'll help
clear the secretions.

29:03.009 --> 29:04.476
That's all there is to it.

29:04.476 --> 29:05.978
How often?

29:05.978 --> 29:07.947
Uh, maybe two,
three times a day.

29:07.947 --> 29:09.481
More if he sounds junky.

29:09.481 --> 29:12.018
We're gonna get you
some help at home.

29:12.018 --> 29:14.453
I don't think so.
( chuckles )

29:14.453 --> 29:17.456
You know how many caregivers
he's made me get rid of?

29:17.456 --> 29:20.426
It's just easier
if I do it myself.

29:20.426 --> 29:23.062
Sometimes
you need a break.
Well, I'm fine.

29:23.062 --> 29:24.997
Uh, I've cut back
to 12 hours a day,

29:24.997 --> 29:28.067
and we have
night aides now.

29:28.067 --> 29:30.236
I mean, if there's
a problem, they still
come and wake me up.

29:30.236 --> 29:35.007
It's hard for me to
see someone not giving
him the best care, so...

29:38.410 --> 29:40.980
Nate.

29:40.980 --> 29:42.048
Hey, Nate.

29:47.319 --> 29:50.256
Okay, you let us know
when you're ready to talk.

29:50.256 --> 29:53.225
Can I take him home?

29:53.225 --> 29:56.528
In a couple of days.

29:56.528 --> 29:59.031
How about tonight?

29:59.031 --> 30:00.232
I think that after everything

30:00.232 --> 30:02.101
he's been through,

30:02.101 --> 30:04.303
we should probably
keep an eye on him.

30:04.303 --> 30:07.173
I know, but I promised him

30:07.173 --> 30:09.108
that I would keep
him at home.

30:09.108 --> 30:10.576
It's what he wants.

30:10.576 --> 30:13.145
Well, he'll do better
in the hospital.
Yeah.

30:14.881 --> 30:18.017
But I promised him.

30:20.987 --> 30:23.289
How long have you been with him?

30:23.289 --> 30:26.525
Oh, 21 years.
( laughs )

30:26.525 --> 30:29.862
It's hard for me to believe
sometimes.

30:29.862 --> 30:34.033
It started out as just a job,
you know, but, um...

30:34.033 --> 30:38.104
after a while...

30:38.104 --> 30:42.108
There was this one time
I traveled with him to Boston.

30:42.108 --> 30:45.878
It was, uh, September of '99.

30:45.878 --> 30:49.448
It's beautiful there
in the fall.

30:49.448 --> 30:55.587
He was giving a paper at a
molecular biology symposium.

30:55.587 --> 30:58.190
I was still prepping
his slides and his handouts

30:58.190 --> 31:00.927
five minutes
before the talk.

31:00.927 --> 31:05.131
We worked so hard, he added
a couple of days to the trip.

31:07.934 --> 31:11.470
We went up to Cape Cod.

31:11.470 --> 31:14.373
The hotel was right
on the beach, and, uh...

31:17.343 --> 31:19.545
( crying softly )

31:19.545 --> 31:21.981
He took me sailing.

31:24.483 --> 31:28.354
It was one of those times
in life where you think

31:28.354 --> 31:31.323
everything is just
falling into place.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.062
( sniffles )

31:36.062 --> 31:38.998
Couple of weeks later
he got the diagnosis.

31:38.998 --> 31:42.001
Oh, one more thing--
I saw the neurologist today.
Everything okay?

31:42.001 --> 31:44.003
All the blood
tests are normal.
Oh, good.

31:44.003 --> 31:46.605
No peri-ventricular lesions
on the MRI, so it's not MS.

31:46.605 --> 31:49.541
Great!
Although I was kind
of hoping for MS.

31:49.541 --> 31:53.412
What?
The EMG showed
denervation

31:53.412 --> 31:55.381
of the muscles of
the right hand.

31:55.381 --> 31:58.117
I have motor neuron
disease, Fran.

31:58.117 --> 32:00.286
I have ALS.

32:00.286 --> 32:03.622
Oh, my God.
The average
life expectancy

32:03.622 --> 32:05.691
is four years, but five percent
of patients progress

32:05.691 --> 32:06.993
and then plateau.

32:06.993 --> 32:08.594
There's some guy in his 60s

32:08.594 --> 32:10.729
who's still playing golf
40 years into the disease.

32:10.729 --> 32:13.132
They're starting me
on a new drug called Riluzole.

32:13.132 --> 32:14.700
It's very promising

32:14.700 --> 32:16.668
at slowing the progression
of the degeneration.

32:19.205 --> 32:21.507
There are going to
be some challenges.

32:21.507 --> 32:23.475
But I'm very hopeful
about all the new research,

32:23.475 --> 32:25.011
and they're setting me up

32:25.011 --> 32:26.678
with a multi-disciplinary
support team,

32:26.678 --> 32:29.015
physical and occupational
therapist, nutritionist,

32:29.015 --> 32:31.317
speech pathologist,
respiratory therapists.

32:31.317 --> 32:32.751
I could help, too.

32:32.751 --> 32:35.221
Well, I'm still going to
need an assistant, Fran.

32:35.221 --> 32:37.023
Obviously, of course.
Now more than ever.

32:37.023 --> 32:39.525
That's not what I meant.

32:44.396 --> 32:47.399
I have to put all my energy
into fighting this disease.

32:50.336 --> 32:52.304
He didn't want
to start something

32:52.304 --> 32:53.739
only to have it
taken away.

32:53.739 --> 32:56.608
He was, um, he was afraid
it would be too painful.

32:56.608 --> 32:57.776
For you or for him?

32:57.776 --> 32:59.345
For both of us.

32:59.345 --> 33:01.313
COMPUTER:
Hello.

33:01.313 --> 33:04.050
Hey. Good to see
you're back.

33:05.451 --> 33:08.087
My neck.

33:08.087 --> 33:09.555
They did a trake.

33:09.555 --> 33:12.758
LOCKHART:
To treat
your pneumonia.

33:12.758 --> 33:14.326
Really?

33:14.326 --> 33:16.462
Yes, your oxygen
levels are up,

33:16.462 --> 33:18.364
your title volume's improved,
you're more alert.

33:21.767 --> 33:24.436
I'll never wear
a turtleneck again.

33:24.436 --> 33:25.604
You still want
an ICU bed?

33:25.604 --> 33:27.073
Uh, no.

33:27.073 --> 33:28.307
I'll get
a tele bed.
Thank you.

33:28.307 --> 33:29.641
We're admitting you

33:29.641 --> 33:32.611
for antibiotics and
respiratory therapy.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.548
No trake.

33:41.520 --> 33:44.423
I thought you
would've wanted this.

33:47.093 --> 33:48.460
Appreciate it.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.162
It saved your life, Nate.

33:51.297 --> 33:54.766
I understand.

33:54.766 --> 33:58.804
Um, you know, you can live
for a long time with this.

34:00.739 --> 34:03.675
My facial muscles
are getting weaker.

34:03.675 --> 34:07.446
Once I lose my eye movements,
I'll be locked in.

34:07.446 --> 34:11.617
I'll be seeing, hearing,
and feeling my surroundings

34:11.617 --> 34:14.553
but I'll be unable to
communicate my needs and wishes.

34:14.553 --> 34:18.724
I don't want to get
to that point.

34:18.724 --> 34:21.127
Well, this infection that you
have is a temporary setback.

34:21.127 --> 34:22.428
Once you rid of that,

34:22.428 --> 34:23.829
you're going to be right back
to where you were.

34:23.829 --> 34:25.731
I'm going downhill.

34:25.731 --> 34:27.766
Well, maybe more slowly

34:27.766 --> 34:29.501
with good oxygenation
and ventilation.

34:29.501 --> 34:32.237
Had enough.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.139
No, you know what,
in a couple of days

34:34.139 --> 34:35.274
you're going to have
a lot more energy...

34:35.274 --> 34:36.475
He's made up his mind.

34:40.679 --> 34:43.514
Take out trake.

34:54.860 --> 34:57.163
I can't.

35:11.643 --> 35:13.379
Fine.
Then home.

35:13.379 --> 35:15.181
Poker.

35:24.923 --> 35:30.262
He wants me to invite some of
his friends over for poker.

35:30.262 --> 35:31.697
His friends can visit him
in the hospital.

35:37.203 --> 35:40.639
Beer.

35:40.639 --> 35:41.940
We've got beer.

35:41.940 --> 35:44.910
Well, you're in no condition
to go home, Nate.

35:51.417 --> 35:53.519
I'm not comfortable
with this.

35:53.519 --> 35:54.920
I am.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.555
Why don't we wait
in the lobby?

35:56.555 --> 35:58.524
No. Outside.

35:58.524 --> 36:00.459
I'm not sure that
the van is here yet.

36:00.459 --> 36:01.727
Fresh air.

36:01.727 --> 36:03.362
You know, it's
cold out there.

36:03.362 --> 36:07.599
Oh, no.
I might catch pneumonia.

36:07.599 --> 36:10.436
Well, I'm sending a respiratory
therapist home to assist you.

36:12.338 --> 36:13.472
Don't bother.

36:13.472 --> 36:15.541
You know, it's to help Fran.

36:17.409 --> 36:20.379
Tonight, we turn off
the vent.

36:22.614 --> 36:25.251
Go to sleep, won't wake up.

36:28.320 --> 36:29.521
Fran...

36:29.521 --> 36:30.622
I got those papers
for you to sign.

36:30.622 --> 36:33.725
I'll be quick.

36:33.725 --> 36:34.893
I know the way out.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.462
Well, it's
hospital policy.

36:36.462 --> 36:38.397
Somebody has to accompany
you to the van.

36:38.397 --> 36:40.266
You forgot your coat.

36:42.634 --> 36:44.503
You have a treatable
condition.

36:44.503 --> 36:45.971
I'm just asking for two
days in the hospital.

36:45.971 --> 36:47.273
Two days.

36:47.273 --> 36:49.575
Can't.
Why not?

36:49.575 --> 36:52.578
I don't want to be a soul
trapped in a corpse.

36:52.578 --> 36:53.879
Well, you're
not there yet.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.013
Close.

36:55.013 --> 36:56.348
Wait. Just wait a minute.

36:56.348 --> 36:57.516
Wait, wait.

36:57.516 --> 36:59.618
What happened to
fighting this disease?

36:59.618 --> 37:01.653
Too tired.

37:01.653 --> 37:02.688
Well, once we treat
the pneumonia

37:02.688 --> 37:03.989
you're going to feel better.

37:03.989 --> 37:06.292
You can even plateau--
look at Stephen Hawking,

37:06.292 --> 37:07.893
he's had this disease
for 40 years.

37:07.893 --> 37:10.629
I'm not Stephen Hawking.

37:10.629 --> 37:12.998
You're still advising
students, writing books.

37:12.998 --> 37:14.900
You published the lead article
in Cel two months ago.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.568
Just please wait. Wait.

37:18.870 --> 37:21.540
If you recover from this,

37:21.540 --> 37:25.311
you could hang on
until there's a cure.

37:30.816 --> 37:32.684
If I don't recover?

37:37.456 --> 37:38.657
Then I'll be there...

37:40.859 --> 37:43.929
to make sure you're comfortable,

37:43.929 --> 37:46.698
take you off the vent
and let you go.

37:58.910 --> 38:01.046
I bet you ten bucks
you can get through this.

38:11.890 --> 38:13.024
Ten bucks?

38:15.026 --> 38:17.363
All you have to do is
go back into the hospital.

38:21.667 --> 38:25.371
I'm impressed.

38:25.371 --> 38:28.374
You've become
a pretty persuasive doctor.

38:31.810 --> 38:35.113
I'm not so sure I'd be here
if it weren't for you.

38:35.113 --> 38:36.682
NATE:
The air you breathe,

38:36.682 --> 38:39.084
all the food you eat,

38:39.084 --> 38:43.422
it all leads to the production
of one incredible molecule.

38:43.422 --> 38:46.057
ATP-- adenosine triphosphatase--

38:46.057 --> 38:49.127
the end result of oxidative
phosphorylation.

38:49.127 --> 38:53.499
This is the force of life.

38:53.499 --> 38:59.405
7,300 kilocalories per mole.

38:59.405 --> 39:01.072
Pure unadulterated energy.

39:01.072 --> 39:02.674
What are you doing right now?

39:02.674 --> 39:05.611
You're taking notes,
uh, crossing your legs,

39:05.611 --> 39:08.880
coughing, digesting your food,
listening to your voice mail

39:08.880 --> 39:10.749
while the professor
is lecturing.

39:10.749 --> 39:13.485
Every action of the human body,

39:13.485 --> 39:20.459
every single thing it means
to be alive, is powered by ATP.

39:20.459 --> 39:21.693
How much do you weigh?

39:21.693 --> 39:23.829
155.
Stand up.

39:23.829 --> 39:26.164
Stand up.

39:26.164 --> 39:31.637
Every day, the human body
uses 180 pounds of ATP.

39:31.637 --> 39:33.972
Yes, yes.
More than you weigh.

39:33.972 --> 39:37.943
And yet... and yet, this body
only has half a pound of ATP.

39:37.943 --> 39:38.810
What's going on?

39:38.810 --> 39:40.145
You recycle it?

39:40.145 --> 39:42.047
Yes. Yes, you do.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.515
Thank you.

39:43.515 --> 39:44.950
Bravo. Thank you.
A-plus.

39:44.950 --> 39:46.585
You recycle it.

39:46.585 --> 39:49.721
Otherwise, you would
burn off your ATP

39:49.721 --> 39:51.457
in five minutes.

39:51.457 --> 39:55.461
The human body recycles it
300 times a day.

39:55.461 --> 39:56.928
If you were a car,

39:56.928 --> 40:01.567
you would get 150,000 miles
to the tank.

40:01.567 --> 40:03.969
Now, electron transport jams
protons

40:03.969 --> 40:06.805
into the inter-membrane space
of the mitochondria.

40:06.805 --> 40:10.909
ATP synthase is, in fact,
a rotary engine.

40:10.909 --> 40:13.912
The flow of protons
spins the shaft.

40:13.912 --> 40:17.716
That sucks in ADP
and blows out fresh ATP,

40:17.716 --> 40:21.052
filled with the energy it takes
to fuel the human body,

40:21.052 --> 40:24.690
the human mind and,
yes, yes, the human spirit.

40:24.690 --> 40:26.191
Okay, we're done.
Thank you very much.

40:26.191 --> 40:27.726
Tomorrow... thank you.
( applause )

40:27.726 --> 40:31.162
Tomorrow, chapter 19, Lehninger.

40:31.162 --> 40:33.098
Electron transport in detail.
Thank you.

40:33.098 --> 40:34.733
Thank you.

40:39.705 --> 40:40.906
Dr. Lennox...

40:40.906 --> 40:41.973
Yeah.
Do you have
a minute?

40:41.973 --> 40:43.241
And you are...?

40:43.241 --> 40:45.176
Abby Lockhart.
I'm a first year.

40:45.176 --> 40:46.812
Uh-huh.

40:46.812 --> 40:49.815
Um, I need your signature
to drop this class.

40:49.815 --> 40:51.483
You want to quit
Biochemistry?

40:51.483 --> 40:53.084
Well, I failed the midterm,
and I'm not feeling

40:53.084 --> 40:54.853
very optimistic about
the final, so...

40:54.853 --> 40:56.187
It's a required course.

40:56.187 --> 40:57.756
Well, maybe I'll
try again next year.

40:57.756 --> 41:00.726
Tough to do, second year
curriculum is pretty busy.

41:00.726 --> 41:02.093
I'm thinking about
maybe taking a year off

41:02.093 --> 41:03.529
to just reconsider my options.

41:03.529 --> 41:05.997
Wow, I'm surprised.

41:05.997 --> 41:08.834
So, you don't want
to be a doctor?

41:10.936 --> 41:12.203
I-I... I'm trying.

41:12.203 --> 41:13.639
I just... it's a lot.

41:13.639 --> 41:15.541
With biochemistry
and physiology,

41:15.541 --> 41:16.708
and microbiology,
anatomy.

41:16.708 --> 41:18.209
It's just a lot,
a lot to memorize.

41:18.209 --> 41:19.945
Ah, there's your problem.

41:19.945 --> 41:21.680
Rote memorization

41:21.680 --> 41:22.881
is the path to failure.

41:22.881 --> 41:24.550
Um...

41:24.550 --> 41:27.052
You like sports?

41:29.555 --> 41:31.690
Ice skate?
Not really, no.

41:31.690 --> 41:33.559
You dance?
Everybody likes
to dance.

41:33.559 --> 41:36.061
I took ballet when I was a kid,
yes.

41:36.061 --> 41:37.896
Did you like it?

41:39.164 --> 41:40.866
Yes.

41:40.866 --> 41:42.834
I was the Sugarplum Fairy
in The Nutcracker,

41:42.834 --> 41:43.902
third from the left.

41:43.902 --> 41:45.003
Excellent.

41:45.003 --> 41:46.738
Do you want to learn?

41:46.738 --> 41:51.643
Stop memorizing and
think conceptually.

41:51.643 --> 41:55.981
Biochemistry is
the dance of life.

41:55.981 --> 41:58.784
Ballet is
its central dogma.

41:58.784 --> 42:03.054
Adenine holds hands with
thymine, cytosine with guanine.

42:03.054 --> 42:05.290
When they let go,

42:05.290 --> 42:08.159
a line of gypsy dancers
breaks free

42:08.159 --> 42:09.828
to look for new partners,

42:09.828 --> 42:11.597
and messenger RNA
is created.

42:11.597 --> 42:13.331
Ooh. Sorry.
Oh, sorry.

42:13.331 --> 42:14.633
I'm not usually so clumsy.

42:14.633 --> 42:15.634
See?

42:18.737 --> 42:21.139
Um, yeah.
Can you sign my form?

42:23.709 --> 42:26.144
My office hours begin
at 1:00 p.m. on Tuesdays.

42:27.613 --> 42:28.614
Show up.

42:30.081 --> 42:31.116
You're going to tutor me?

42:31.116 --> 42:32.150
Think of it
as dance lessons.

42:32.150 --> 42:33.919
After three weeks,
I guarantee

42:33.919 --> 42:35.987
that you will pass
your makeup midterm
with flying colors.

42:35.987 --> 42:37.923
In fact, I will
bet you ten bucks.

42:37.923 --> 42:39.858
That's a very generous offer.
I just...

42:39.858 --> 42:41.259
I-I just don't... I think...

42:41.259 --> 42:44.996
I know that you
can do this.

42:44.996 --> 42:47.966
I wish I had
your confidence.

42:47.966 --> 42:51.637
You will. Don't give up.

42:51.637 --> 42:54.172
If nothing else,
I will teach you how to fight.

42:54.172 --> 42:55.907
See you Tuesday.

42:57.743 --> 42:58.744
Thank you.
