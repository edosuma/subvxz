What fun is being vice president
of field operations

when I can't go out into the field?

He can't get me. I'm safe in here.
I'm safe--

01:17.077 --> 01:18.369
I never said you were.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.580
My hands are cold.
I do pretend bongos to warm them up,

01:20.663 --> 01:23.792
and the bongos make me brave--
[hyperventilating]

01:25.251 --> 01:28.880
Sure they do, sport.
Let's just slip these on here.

01:30.381 --> 01:31.382

-[thunder cracks]
-Ah!

01:33.426 --> 01:35.094

-Oh, great. It's contagious.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.685
-[Gigi] Hello.
-It's Dad!

01:43.895 --> 01:46.731
Oh, hi, sweetie.
How's your big-boy office job? What the--?

01:46.815 --> 01:48.191
Why aren't you coming home yet?

01:48.274 --> 01:49.567
Oh, hey, Tim.

01:49.651 --> 01:52.612
Well, the storm flooded the bridge
back into town,

01:52.695 --> 01:55.198
so we may not be back
until tomorrow morning.

01:55.281 --> 01:58.201
Tomorrow morning? As in tomorrow?

01:58.451 --> 02:01.663
But don't you worry, big guy.
You've got Gigi there.

02:01.955 --> 02:05.208
And we're fine here.
Office is a little waterlogged, but--

02:05.291 --> 02:06.209
[Mom] Great news.

02:06.543 --> 02:10.171
I found some blue cheese dressing
and deli ham that wasn't underwater yet.

02:10.255 --> 02:11.297
Ooh, la, la.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.007
"Le cuisine française."

02:13.424 --> 02:15.009
Gotta go. Be good. Bye, Tim.

02:15.093 --> 02:15.927
Love you, Tim.

02:16.010 --> 02:17.637
- Kiss the baby.
-Not happening.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.932
Ted, is that my coffee mug?

02:22.934 --> 02:24.727
Your dad and mom stuck at the office?

02:25.145 --> 02:26.563
Then I'd better go prepare.

02:26.729 --> 02:29.858
We don't have much time.
The worst of this is yet to come.

02:31.276 --> 02:35.113
The worst? Are we getting tornadoes?
Hail? [gasps]

02:35.196 --> 02:37.490
-Hail-nadoes?
-Don't joke.

02:37.866 --> 02:40.076
A storm this bad means...

02:40.451 --> 02:41.619
he's coming.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.372
Who? Thunderstorm Santa?

02:44.622 --> 02:46.833
Worse. The Frodarg.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.376
Not a real word. Try again.

02:48.543 --> 02:51.129
The Hartman Bog Frodarg.

03:05.184 --> 03:08.021
...with two glowing red eyes.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.524
Only two eyes?
Pretty lame for a monster, if you ask me.

03:11.608 --> 03:12.442
-Get down!
-[grunts]

03:13.109 --> 03:15.069
-[Tim] The body of a dinosaur.
-[snarling]

03:15.153 --> 03:17.488
The spines of a dinosaur.

03:17.947 --> 03:20.575
The razor-sharp claws of a tiger.

03:20.992 --> 03:22.869
Why not the claws of a dinosaur?

03:22.952 --> 03:25.914
[scoffs] 'Cause then he'd just be
a dinosaur with a frog face.

03:25.997 --> 03:27.957
Ooh, don't forget the two eyes.

03:28.416 --> 03:31.336
You won't be joking so much
if the Frodarg is hungry, or--

-Templeton!

03:40.053 --> 03:41.512
I just had a three-milk dinner.

03:41.804 --> 03:44.224
Does your make-believe monster
wanna get vomited on?

03:44.307 --> 03:45.683
He's not make-believe.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.269
Everyone in town knows about the Frodarg,

03:48.353 --> 03:51.356
but few have seen him
and lived to tell the tale.

03:51.439 --> 03:52.482
How convenient.

04:02.533 --> 04:04.244
I'm no expert in urban legends,

04:04.327 --> 04:07.121
but I'm pretty sure the Frodarg
is totally not real.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.164
Like, at all.

04:08.456 --> 04:09.832
Yeah, well, a year ago,

04:09.916 --> 04:13.211
I was pretty sure that babies
totally didn't talk or run corporations.

04:13.294 --> 04:16.130
-Like, at all. But here we are.
-Touché.

04:16.214 --> 04:17.382
-[thunder cracks]
-Ah!

04:17.882 --> 04:19.425
-[panting]
-[fingers drumming]

04:20.718 --> 04:23.596
You'll be okay.
This storm's like a bear market.

04:23.763 --> 04:26.766
We're all gonna take it in the shorts
for a while, but it can't last forever.

04:26.849 --> 04:29.477
I didn't understand any of that,
but it helps that you're trying.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.771
-Whatever you need.
-Now help me barricade the door

04:31.854 --> 04:34.857
so the Frodarg can't claw through
and drink our brains like milkshakes.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.693
-[baby monitor chimes]
-Sorry, that's work.

04:36.776 --> 04:39.612
If you need further emotional support,
though, maybe try Gigi.

04:39.737 --> 04:41.948
But I don't wanna leave you here
with the Frodarg.

04:42.031 --> 04:44.117
I am confident that's not a problem.

04:44.867 --> 04:46.953
Gigi, I'm scared!

04:48.121 --> 04:48.955
Go for Boss Baby.

04:49.205 --> 04:52.750
Good. You've got your crisis face.
We need that.

04:52.834 --> 04:55.920
-Why? Do we have a crisis?
- Don't you see my crisis face?

04:57.672 --> 04:59.215
Yes?

04:59.465 --> 05:02.051
Someone knows about Stinkless Serum.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.469
What? Which someone?

05:03.678 --> 05:06.222
A dog someone. Puppy Co.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.434
Oh. You know what?
I can totally see your crisis face now.

05:09.517 --> 05:11.019
Wait! Did you say Puppy Co.?

05:11.102 --> 05:12.395
[thunder cracks]

05:13.229 --> 05:16.232
The Frodarg? Oh, Timmy, come here.

05:16.983 --> 05:19.944
I promise,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

05:22.030 --> 05:22.947
Okay.

05:23.698 --> 05:26.701
Because I'm not letting that swamp demon
set one scaly foot in this house!

05:27.118 --> 05:29.078
Eat somebody else's family, Frodarg!

05:29.370 --> 05:32.582
[grunting]

05:35.001 --> 05:38.463
Without human leadership,
Puppy Co. has gone to the dogs.

05:38.796 --> 05:40.590
Pun intended. You may giggle.

05:40.673 --> 05:42.842
[forced giggling]

05:43.134 --> 05:44.135
End giggles now.

05:44.469 --> 05:45.928
An all-puppy organization.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.765
Pure, fluffy, cuddly evil.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.224
I'll secure the serum, ma'am.

05:50.308 --> 05:53.019
I'm not playing fetch
with our company's future.

05:53.352 --> 05:56.731
Pun returned. Mine was better.
Now, clarification.

05:57.023 --> 06:02.028
Intel says Puppy Co.'s best agent
en route, Bug, dispatched. Thoughts?

06:02.320 --> 06:04.280
Did you say... Bug?

06:05.031 --> 06:07.784
Tech-- failing. Explain your concern.

06:08.076 --> 06:11.746
It can't be  the  Bug. He doesn't exist.
He's just a legend.

06:12.121 --> 06:14.874
Can't hear-- Situation is critical.

06:14.957 --> 06:16.709
He's coming. Be ready.

06:23.383 --> 06:27.303
He's real, right? Totally real.
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!

06:27.386 --> 06:29.597
Saw the beast myself
when I was just a little girl.

06:29.680 --> 06:30.515
[shudders]

06:30.807 --> 06:33.392
Hideous. I mean the creature was, not me.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.019
I was stinking adorable.

06:35.103 --> 06:38.106
And you know how much the Frodarg
likes eating cute little children.

06:38.189 --> 06:39.107
[whimpers]

06:39.315 --> 06:41.734
But don't you be afraid.
You're gonna be fine.

06:41.818 --> 06:43.694
As long as you follow the rules
of the Frodarg.

06:43.986 --> 06:45.822
What are the rules?
Hurry up and tell me the--!

06:46.989 --> 06:48.950
One, never take a shower.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.744
The more you smell like a swamp,
the less you'll smell like dinner.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.204
No bath. Way ahead of you.

06:53.287 --> 06:54.997
Two, keep raw liver handy.

06:55.081 --> 06:57.583
Liver to the Frodarg
is like garlic to a vampire.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.919
I always keep some in the cooler
for nights like this.

07:00.044 --> 07:00.878
Liver means we live.

07:00.962 --> 07:03.798
And three, never turn out the lights.

07:03.881 --> 07:05.383
It can only see in the dark.

07:05.466 --> 07:07.176
I don't care if we blind the neighbors

07:07.260 --> 07:09.053
and bankrupt your parents
with the power bill.

07:09.137 --> 07:13.516
If we're going to survive this night,
you turn on all the lights.

07:13.599 --> 07:14.976
Every single one. Got it.

07:19.063 --> 07:20.064
Mm! [sniffs]

07:20.148 --> 07:22.567
"Fresh Springtime Meadow."
No baby or serum smells here.

07:23.317 --> 07:24.152
Ah!

07:24.402 --> 07:27.321
Help me protect the house.
We've gotta lock the place down.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.949
Good call. We can't let him get in.

07:30.032 --> 07:32.118
-Wait, what are you doing?
-[spray hissing]

07:32.201 --> 07:34.662
Deodorizing the place
to throw him off the scent.

07:34.745 --> 07:36.581
Ooh! Your no-tears shampoo.

07:36.664 --> 07:38.958
Smear that ocean breeze smell
on the windows and doorknobs.

07:39.375 --> 07:42.211
No, we can't make the room
smell like nice and clean me.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.255
That's exactly what the Frodarg likes.

07:44.505 --> 07:48.384
Frodarg? You're chasing nickels
around a $10 bill, Templeton.

07:48.676 --> 07:50.094
We've got real problems now.

07:50.303 --> 07:54.599
Bigger than a tiger-clawed dino-frog
that slurps brain milkshakes?

07:54.765 --> 07:55.600
Way bigger.

07:55.683 --> 07:58.686
Puppy Co. knows about the serum,
and they've sent the best.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.980
Bug the Pug.

08:02.773 --> 08:05.026
A pug? Those little squishy-faced dogs

08:05.109 --> 08:07.028
that look happy and sad at the same time?

08:07.278 --> 08:08.905
Do not take Bug the Pug lightly!

08:08.988 --> 08:11.616
That dog is the stuff of corporate legend.

08:11.908 --> 08:14.952
He's like a ninja, and a wolf,
and a werewolf samurai ninja,

08:15.203 --> 08:18.289
all wrapped up in a muscly,
squirmy pug body.

08:18.873 --> 08:22.043
He attacks without warning
and disappears just as quickly.

08:22.126 --> 08:23.628
-[grunts]
-[whimpers]

08:24.253 --> 08:26.297
-I never clocked out!
-Ah!

08:26.380 --> 08:28.841
[Boss Baby]  Nothing is safe
from his slobbery jaws.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.093
-[panting, whimpering]
-[snarling]

08:32.053 --> 08:34.639
[Boss Baby]  And you never see him coming.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.474
Ah!

08:38.142 --> 08:41.771
If Bug the Pug is after the serum,
he'll stop at nothing to get it.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.065
-[jingle plays]
-[lid whirs]

08:45.483 --> 08:48.528
He'll destroy this entire house
and whoever gets in his way.

08:48.653 --> 08:49.654
We are not safe.

08:49.737 --> 08:51.822
So Gigi gave me some rules
to stop the Frodarg.

08:51.906 --> 08:54.200
-There is no Frodarg!
-Dogs aren't spies!

08:54.742 --> 08:56.953
Raw liver. Bog monsters hate it.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.371
And dogs love it.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.498
Now's not the time to argue.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.542
No matter what's coming,
which is the Frodarg,

09:02.875 --> 09:05.878
it's up to us to protect the house.
Let's be logical.

09:06.087 --> 09:09.298
You're right. We need real backup
for my real, actual threat.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.550
I'm calling Staci and Jimbo.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.010
What? And set up a baby buffet?

09:13.427 --> 09:16.806
Why not put out a sign?
"All Frodarg can eat!" [grunts]

09:17.014 --> 09:19.850
-Let go!
-Never!

09:19.934 --> 09:21.894
[panting, snuffling]

09:30.987 --> 09:33.781

09:49.547 --> 09:51.382
[both grunting]

09:52.800 --> 09:54.677
[baby monitor chiming]

09:55.011 --> 09:58.389
What's up, sir?
Oh! Brother battle to the death, huh?

09:58.806 --> 10:00.641
I always knew this day would come.

10:00.725 --> 10:04.395
If Tim wins, I promise to hunt him down
in your honor, sir.

10:04.812 --> 10:06.147
And if you win,

10:06.230 --> 10:10.234
I know a guy from daycare with some
swampland on the Eastern seaboard.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.445
No, Staci. We're both fine.

10:12.528 --> 10:13.654
I'm not. [muffled grunt]

10:13.738 --> 10:17.116
But we do have a crisis.
Puppy Co. knows about Stinkless Serum.

10:17.199 --> 10:18.868
They've sent the best.

10:19.076 --> 10:20.828
-The who?
-Bug the Pug.

10:21.412 --> 10:22.622
Breaking up, sir.

10:23.205 --> 10:26.375
Did you just say Bug the--

10:27.418 --> 10:28.252
Staci?

10:28.336 --> 10:30.379
-[distorted snarling]
-Ah!

10:30.463 --> 10:31.505
[Staci]  ...Pug?

10:31.589 --> 10:32.923
-The pug is here!
-The Frodarg.

10:33.215 --> 10:34.050
Boss!

10:34.800 --> 10:35.676
[snarling continues]

10:35.760 --> 10:37.345
I think it's inside the house.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.055
Or maybe it's just the wind.

10:39.930 --> 10:40.806
Will you cut it out?

10:41.140 --> 10:42.642
There are no monsters, period.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.561
Except sometimes Gigi.
But old age will defeat her.

10:45.978 --> 10:48.105
Still, you were right. We shouldn't fight.

10:48.397 --> 10:51.859
Whatever's in here, which is Bug the Pug,
we must protect the house.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.445
Yes, we should be ready
for either scenario.

10:54.528 --> 10:56.405
Especially the real one,
which is the Frodarg.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.240
I'll build a trap to lure in the Frodarg.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.909
And I'll make one for the pug.

11:02.662 --> 11:03.621
[horn toots]

11:15.341 --> 11:18.177
I'm no longer afraid of you, Frodarg.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.930
Come get your severance package,

11:21.347 --> 11:22.681
Bug the Pug.

11:23.057 --> 11:24.767
-[thunder cracks]
-[both screaming]

11:26.268 --> 11:27.687
-We got this.
-Totally.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.480
[panting]

11:41.117 --> 11:42.660
[electricity crackles]

11:53.295 --> 11:54.547
-[thunder cracks]
-[shouting]

11:54.630 --> 11:55.840
-[Tim] Sorry.
-[Boss Baby] Shh.

11:55.923 --> 11:57.842
-Do you hear something?
-[Tim] I can't tell.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.677
We should creep around and investigate.

11:59.760 --> 12:00.928
[Boss Baby] Sounds reasonable.

12:01.679 --> 12:02.638
[both screaming]

12:02.721 --> 12:04.807
-Where am I? What is this in my hand?
-[Tim] Soap!

12:04.890 --> 12:06.350
Ew! I'm clean now!

12:06.851 --> 12:08.769
Hands off my grandson, Frodarg!

12:09.270 --> 12:10.479
Or grandsons.

12:10.896 --> 12:14.275
Both of them. I'm just saying,
if you have to pick-- Never mind.

12:14.692 --> 12:17.111
-Everyone okay?
-No. Can we call Mom and Dad?

12:17.361 --> 12:19.864
Oh, Timmy, I'm sorry,
the phones are dead.

12:21.699 --> 12:24.410
Listen. I'm gonna check
the circuit breakers in the basement.

12:24.493 --> 12:25.786
I'm sure we just blew a fuse.

12:27.329 --> 12:31.250
But if not, and the Frodarg gets me,
you avenge my death in blood.

12:31.667 --> 12:34.128
No mercy. It's the Templeton way.

12:34.462 --> 12:37.006
Sure. Um... Can I come, too?

12:37.173 --> 12:38.007
I should come.

12:38.257 --> 12:40.760
That's my man of the house.
Grab your brother.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.345
I think he wants to stay.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.016
Alone in the dark?

12:47.099 --> 12:50.269
We've got liver in our fort.
It's the safest place in the house.

12:50.352 --> 12:52.313
Guess it'll build character. Let's go.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.110
[panting] Please be the Frodarg,

12:58.194 --> 13:00.070
please be the Frodarg,
please be the Frodarg.

13:20.090 --> 13:21.842
[stairs creaking]

13:23.093 --> 13:24.929
-[rustling]
-[panting]

13:25.888 --> 13:27.139
[Gigi] We are not alone.

13:27.681 --> 13:28.891
[snarling]

13:30.935 --> 13:32.645
Gigi. Look.

13:32.853 --> 13:33.979
[rattling]

13:35.689 --> 13:36.815
-[snarls]
-[Tim gasps]

13:39.985 --> 13:41.529
It's... it.

13:41.612 --> 13:45.157
Don't run. Fear only makes it hungrier.

13:46.033 --> 13:48.160
Come and get me,
you frog-headed abomination!

13:49.203 --> 13:50.454
Ah!

13:50.538 --> 13:51.455
It came and got me!

13:52.164 --> 13:53.290
[Tim screams]

13:53.374 --> 13:54.291
Frodarg!

13:54.375 --> 13:56.544
Run, Timmy! Save yourself and the baby!

13:57.044 --> 13:59.880
-[screaming, grunts]
-[panting]

14:02.049 --> 14:04.843
[panting, whimpering]

14:04.927 --> 14:06.762
-[door rattling]
-[Gigi] It's locked!

14:06.929 --> 14:09.515
I'm gonna get the lights back on!
Find a place to hide!

14:12.810 --> 14:13.644
[gasps]

14:14.436 --> 14:15.271
Identify yourself!

14:15.354 --> 14:17.439
It's me. I saw it. I saw the Frodarg.

14:17.523 --> 14:18.399
It got Gigi.

14:18.482 --> 14:19.441
Impossible.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.944
It jumped her in the basement.
We've got to go save her.

14:22.194 --> 14:24.738
Think, Templeton, because we need to know
how to fight this thing.

14:25.072 --> 14:27.867
Did you see a bog monster
or a nasty smoosh-faced mutt?

14:28.200 --> 14:30.870
It's-- I honestly don't know anymore.

14:30.953 --> 14:33.205
Gah. If it's Bug, he's coming up here
for the serum.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.164
I have to protect it.

14:34.373 --> 14:37.585
If it's Frodarg, I have to go down there
to save Gigi from it.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.211
Just give me two seconds to freak out.

14:39.837 --> 14:43.799
[screams, pants]

14:43.883 --> 14:44.717
Go time.

14:45.634 --> 14:47.803
Templeton, wait.
I know there's no Frodarg,

14:47.887 --> 14:51.181
but, just in case,
you might wanna dress for the occasion.

14:55.853 --> 14:56.687
How do I look?

14:58.439 --> 15:01.358
-Like a marshmallow that's going to war.
-Is that good?

15:01.525 --> 15:03.986
Depends on how much
that thing down there likes marshmallows.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.280
Oh, man, that liver smells terrible.

15:06.530 --> 15:08.407
Ooh, yeah. Don't bring it back.

15:09.992 --> 15:10.826
[panting]

15:13.495 --> 15:15.664
[snarling]

15:16.081 --> 15:16.916
[gasps]

15:20.544 --> 15:23.422
I know you're there. Sh-- Show yourself.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.092
[gasps]

15:29.178 --> 15:30.012
[exhales]

15:30.387 --> 15:31.597
Hey, I think he left.

15:34.558 --> 15:36.435
-[gasps]
-Ah!

15:37.061 --> 15:38.187
Ah! Frodarg!

15:38.270 --> 15:41.357
-[Tim] Ah!
-It's real! I'm coming, Templeton!

15:41.440 --> 15:42.274
[Tim grunting]

15:42.358 --> 15:44.193
Leave him alone, you-- Eh?

15:44.276 --> 15:45.986
[both grunting]

15:47.237 --> 15:48.113
Uh...

15:49.949 --> 15:51.659
-Monster!
-Ah! Danny?

15:52.117 --> 15:53.452
[coos]

15:53.535 --> 15:54.620
You scared me.

15:54.870 --> 15:57.623
You scared me.
What the heck are you doing here?

15:57.873 --> 15:59.083
The rain flooded our basement,

15:59.166 --> 16:01.418
and my dad and his girlfriend
are barreling it out.

16:01.502 --> 16:04.380
Plus, it drove
all the cockroaches upstairs,

16:04.463 --> 16:07.049
and they took over the kitchen.
So that's a whole thing.

16:07.257 --> 16:09.301
I mean, why'd you scare me?

16:09.385 --> 16:10.511
[chuckles]

16:10.594 --> 16:13.681
Oh, yeah, sorry.
Forgot I was dressed like a Frodarg.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.475
Didn't want the real Frodarg
to come after me.

16:16.684 --> 16:20.437
I also haven't taken a bath in a week.
Pretty crafty, huh?

16:20.521 --> 16:22.773
-[coos]
-But it's only been raining for a day.

16:22.856 --> 16:23.816
Never mind.

16:23.899 --> 16:27.653
Danny, listen.
The Frodarg might be in the house.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.030
[chuckles] No way. You see him?

16:30.239 --> 16:33.742
I stared right into those two red eyes.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.786
[chuckles, gasps]

16:35.869 --> 16:38.831
Man, if we could catch
a real-life Frodarg,

16:38.914 --> 16:42.084
we'd be millionaires.
We could get on the news.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.335
-[glass shatters]
-[both gasp]

16:43.419 --> 16:45.004
-[low growling]
-[coos]

16:46.130 --> 16:48.382
-[snarling]
-[glass shatters]

16:49.258 --> 16:50.467
Quick. You got any liver?

16:52.511 --> 16:54.430
Then let's bag us a 'Darg.

16:59.268 --> 17:02.271
-Thanks for coming to save me.
-Night's not over yet. Faster!

17:02.563 --> 17:04.773
[snarling]

17:06.316 --> 17:07.609
Hey, Frodarg!

17:09.695 --> 17:10.946
[barking]

17:11.030 --> 17:11.864
[all gasping]

17:14.241 --> 17:15.075
[Tim] No way.

17:15.492 --> 17:17.161
It's Bug the Pug?

17:17.244 --> 17:18.120
[laughing]

17:18.203 --> 17:19.913
He looks hilarious.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.250
[cries, whimpers]

17:23.792 --> 17:24.626
[Tim gasps]

17:24.835 --> 17:26.420
[whispers] Stinkless Serum!

17:26.503 --> 17:28.505
Let's grab him before he wrecks
the whole house.

17:28.589 --> 17:29.965
[whimpers] Nuh-uh.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.216
No way, man.

17:31.508 --> 17:34.178
Stop waving your arms.
He thinks you wanna play.

17:34.553 --> 17:36.138
Why is he wearing goggles, Tim?

17:36.388 --> 17:39.016
Only dogs with unclean souls wear goggles.

17:39.099 --> 17:42.019
How are you more scared of a Not-Frodarg?

17:42.352 --> 17:43.854
He's got a sweater on.

17:43.937 --> 17:46.356
Animals in people clothes
really freak me out, man.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.942
It's wrong. That's in the Bible.

17:49.276 --> 17:51.528
-[squeals, grunts]
-Ah!

17:51.612 --> 17:52.946
-Get away from me!
-[barking]

17:55.908 --> 17:57.159
[Danny] Somebody help me!

17:58.368 --> 18:00.496
He's wearing a shirt!

18:00.788 --> 18:01.622
[both gasp]

18:02.081 --> 18:03.123
-Don't eat me!
-Ah!

18:04.166 --> 18:06.210
Staci. About time you showed up.

18:06.293 --> 18:10.005
Sir, it's the middle of the night,
and it's pouring rain, and we're babies.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.799
We're lucky to get here at all.

18:12.049 --> 18:14.176
My diaper absorbed every raindrop.

18:14.510 --> 18:17.096
-[sloshes]
-[giggles]

18:17.179 --> 18:20.641
[Danny] Help me! Please!

18:20.724 --> 18:22.101
-Who's that?
-[Boss Baby sighs]

18:22.476 --> 18:24.228
-Bug the Pug is real.
-[glass shatters]

18:24.311 --> 18:27.356
He's as good as they say
and uglier than you can imagine.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.399
Stole the serum
from right under our noses.

18:29.483 --> 18:32.778
Well, we both got scared,
and you left the door open, and-- Ow!

18:32.861 --> 18:35.989
[Danny sobs] Ugh! He's so slobbery!

18:36.365 --> 18:37.282
We'd better help him.

18:37.699 --> 18:39.118
Good idea. You first.

18:39.368 --> 18:42.371
He's just a dog.
He's only scary if you let him be scary.

18:42.454 --> 18:43.580
Easy for you to say.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.582
You're scared of a monster
that's not even real.

18:45.874 --> 18:49.128
The Frodarg is real.
But he's not here right now.

18:49.545 --> 18:51.130
Your monster is,

18:51.672 --> 18:53.549
so let's get him out of here.

18:53.632 --> 18:56.343
But how do we catch
the best corporate thief in the business?

18:56.593 --> 18:58.679
A little bit of liver and a lot of luck.

18:58.762 --> 19:01.598
-Come on, we've got a trap to build.
-What about me?

19:01.682 --> 19:04.726
Simple, Templeton.
You must face the Frodarg.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.019
[thunder rumbles]

19:09.815 --> 19:10.816
Tim!

19:10.899 --> 19:11.775
[barks]

19:12.568 --> 19:14.236
Do something!

19:14.820 --> 19:17.281
Stop letting him chase you.
Chase him right back.

19:19.449 --> 19:21.201
[Danny whimpering]

19:22.202 --> 19:24.788
-[barking]
-[whimpering continues]

19:27.708 --> 19:29.835
You're the Frodarg, man. Use it.

19:30.335 --> 19:31.295
Ah!

19:33.797 --> 19:37.134
Yes, I am the Frodarg.

19:37.551 --> 19:38.886
[snarls]

19:39.303 --> 19:41.096
-Roar!
-[whimpers]

19:42.181 --> 19:43.223
It's on!

19:43.515 --> 19:44.558
[Danny roaring]

19:44.641 --> 19:45.767
Upstairs, Danny!

19:47.019 --> 19:48.270
Get him up the stairs!

19:48.770 --> 19:50.731
[Danny] Get lost, well-dressed pug!

19:51.148 --> 19:53.650
Danny, no! Not outside! Not yet!

19:54.026 --> 19:55.777
Eat light, Frodarg.

19:56.445 --> 19:57.279
[shouts]

19:59.781 --> 20:01.617
Ow.

20:04.578 --> 20:06.914
-Whoa! [grunts]
-[barks, whimpers]

20:10.876 --> 20:11.919
[Tim] Comin' in hot!

20:13.837 --> 20:15.380
Save yourself, man.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.050
I think I broke my butt.

20:25.682 --> 20:26.934
[snarling]

20:31.396 --> 20:33.857
Come and get me, monster. Ah!

20:34.024 --> 20:35.150
It came and got me!

20:35.234 --> 20:38.111
[laughing] It tickles.

20:38.695 --> 20:39.571
Templeton, now!

20:43.700 --> 20:44.868
-[grunts]
-[Tim] Oof!

20:45.744 --> 20:47.287
[laughs]

20:48.538 --> 20:51.583
Sloshy, sloshy, boom, boom.
Sloshy, sloshy, boom, boom.

20:53.335 --> 20:54.670
[snarling]

20:54.753 --> 20:56.213
[sniffing]

20:56.296 --> 20:57.130
What's this, boy?

20:57.464 --> 20:59.049
What is it? Liver?

21:02.928 --> 21:06.431
Well, I hear that's only good
for one thing.

21:11.395 --> 21:13.230
[slo-mo grunt]

21:19.278 --> 21:20.112
Yeah!

21:20.779 --> 21:21.905
[whimpers]

21:21.989 --> 21:23.198
[yowls]

21:23.573 --> 21:25.117
Getting rid of monsters.

21:27.995 --> 21:29.579
-Got him?
-Got him good.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.960
Do not let him out of that cooler.

21:35.335 --> 21:39.339
Get him to Baby Corp and let the CEO know
that the package is secure.

21:39.423 --> 21:40.424
You want the liver back?

21:40.924 --> 21:44.386
Let him eat it.
A gift to a truly worthy adversary.

21:44.928 --> 21:47.681
Until next time, Bug,
you devious canine, you.

21:54.479 --> 21:55.939
Is he gonna be okay?

21:56.565 --> 21:59.526
Yeah. He's just wiped
from having to run for a few minutes.

21:59.818 --> 22:01.653
His insides are mostly nacho cheese.

22:03.071 --> 22:04.614
Thanks for the assist, Templeton.

22:04.698 --> 22:07.034
It got way less scary
when we were scared together.

22:07.117 --> 22:10.162
And if the Frodarg does show up tonight,
we're ready.

22:10.495 --> 22:11.788
I'm ready for anything.

22:11.872 --> 22:14.291
I just beat the dog who once fought
three hammerhead sharks

22:14.374 --> 22:17.544
with his hind paws while hanging on
to a supersonic jet with his teeth.

22:17.961 --> 22:21.256
Well, the Frodarg once ate 17 farmers
in one night.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.175
And you know how tough farmers are.

22:23.592 --> 22:27.012
Let's both agree our fears are irrational.
Yours, slightly more so.

22:27.095 --> 22:29.264
And just be grateful the serum's safe.

22:29.347 --> 22:31.016
All in all, a pretty good night.

22:31.683 --> 22:32.517
[sighs]

22:33.226 --> 22:34.561
[sighs] Yeah.

22:36.396 --> 22:38.482
By the way, our grandmother's
still locked in the basement.

22:38.690 --> 22:39.775
Gigi!
