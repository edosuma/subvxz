00:18.041 --> 00:21.041
I've got this petition for the

00:21.083 --> 00:22.625
Oh, that's good. Very old.

00:22.667 --> 00:26.166
Yeah. Two years ago, some boy

00:26.208 --> 00:27.458

"Oh, well. What can we do?"

00:33.834 --> 00:35.000
Can you believe?

00:35.291 --> 00:37.000
Well, I hadn't heard that

00:37.041 --> 00:39.083
but yes, we'd like to

00:37.041 --> 00:39.083
build a better playground.

Give to me. We sign.

00:40.208 --> 00:41.250
Great!

00:45.750 --> 00:46.834
Is there a problem?

00:47.083 --> 00:48.333
No. No problem.

00:48.709 --> 00:50.500
One problem. Red pen.

00:52.458 --> 00:55.792
In Korea, when you die,

00:52.458 --> 00:55.792
they write you name in red.

00:56.041 --> 00:58.083
Name in red mean you is dead.

00:58.500 --> 01:01.875
I'm so sorry. I had no idea

00:58.500 --> 01:01.875
Koreans were so superstitious.

01:01.917 --> 01:04.458
Oh, many Korean

01:01.917 --> 01:04.458

01:04.500 --> 01:05.792
But we is Christian.

02:15.834 --> 02:18.083

02:18.125 --> 02:19.834
Take $20 and buy album.

06:51.375 --> 06:53.000
but this isn't personal.

06:53.041 --> 06:54.291

-Morning.

06:54.792 --> 06:57.333
-Gerald! You early!

06:57.375 --> 06:59.792
Early for what?

06:57.375 --> 06:59.792
What's he talking about?

06:59.834 --> 07:01.583
I need someone to help store.

07:01.625 --> 07:03.583
Gerald is new helper.

07:04.208 --> 07:05.458
I know why you're doing this.

07:05.709 --> 07:09.125
Don't take personal, Janet.

07:05.709 --> 07:09.125
It's just business.

07:09.667 --> 07:11.959
I'm sorry. But you know

07:09.667 --> 07:11.959
how much I could use the cash.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.333
Well, good luck with that.

07:13.375 --> 07:14.542
He doesn't pay, you know.

07:16.834 --> 07:18.083
You're paying him?

-How much?

07:21.166 --> 07:22.959
-Ten bucks an hour.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.917
You know that's not even

07:23.000 --> 07:24.917
minimum wage.

07:24.959 --> 07:27.458
Okay, I pay to Gerald

07:24.959 --> 07:27.458
$12 an hour.

07:28.041 --> 07:30.000

07:32.375 --> 07:33.542
Wow, cool!

07:34.166 --> 07:35.875
Yet, so unfair.

07:35.917 --> 07:37.959
I can't believe you'd rather

07:35.917 --> 07:37.959
pay Gerald than pay me.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.417
Gerald is a nice,

07:38.000 --> 07:40.417
respectful boy.

07:40.458 --> 07:42.291
In fact, you get

07:40.458 --> 07:42.291
another raise,

07:42.542 --> 07:44.208
$13 an hour!

07:44.959 --> 07:46.166
You know what?

07:46.208 --> 07:48.291
Pay him whatever you want.

07:48.333 --> 07:51.083
It's none of my business.

07:48.333 --> 07:51.083
I've got to get to work.

07:54.208 --> 07:55.917
Thank you so much

07:54.208 --> 07:55.917
for the raise, Mr Kim.

07:56.250 --> 07:57.542
No raise. That was joke.

07:57.792 --> 07:59.000
Oh.

07:59.041 --> 08:00.750
So, it's back to just

07:59.041 --> 08:00.750
$12 an hour.

08:00.792 --> 08:01.875
Ten.

08:01.917 --> 08:03.041
But Janet said

08:01.917 --> 08:03.041
that's not even...

08:03.083 --> 08:04.875
Ten dollars or five dollars,

08:03.083 --> 08:04.875
you choose.

08:06.959 --> 08:08.083
Ten.

08:10.125 --> 08:11.834
This will be your home

08:10.125 --> 08:11.834

08:11.875 --> 08:14.083

08:17.583 --> 08:20.083
-Make sure she gets a uniform.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.959
I thought I was going

08:20.125 --> 08:21.959
to be out front.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.083
You know,

08:22.000 --> 08:23.083
working with customers.

08:23.125 --> 08:24.333
That's my area of expertise.

08:24.625 --> 08:26.000
Everybody starts back here.

08:26.041 --> 08:28.125
And if you play your cards

08:26.041 --> 08:28.125
right, you stay back here.

08:28.834 --> 08:29.959
Okay. That's cool.

08:30.375 --> 08:31.917
You know,

08:30.375 --> 08:31.917
I wasn't sure at first,

08:31.959 --> 08:34.041
but I think it's going to be

08:31.959 --> 08:34.041
fun having you here.

08:34.375 --> 08:37.917
Of course it's going to

08:34.375 --> 08:37.917
be fun. I'm fun. Super fun.

08:38.333 --> 08:40.208
Gotta say, I'm surprised

08:38.333 --> 08:40.208
you're here.

08:40.250 --> 08:42.041
You had a pretty

08:40.250 --> 08:42.041
cushy gig at the store.

08:42.083 --> 08:44.542
Yeah, cushy gig that couldn't

08:42.083 --> 08:44.542
pay for WayHome tickets.

08:44.583 --> 08:46.208
WayHome?

08:44.583 --> 08:46.208
Isn't that this weekend?

08:46.583 --> 08:48.709
-Yeah.

08:46.583 --> 08:48.709
-You know you work weekends.

08:49.583 --> 08:50.959
But probably not this weekend.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.083
Part-timers work

08:51.000 --> 08:53.083
every weekend.

08:54.625 --> 08:55.792
What's this for?

08:56.083 --> 08:57.125
The guy ran over something.

08:57.166 --> 08:58.709
It's a rabbit or a cat.

08:58.750 --> 09:00.041
We'll find out soon enough.

09:00.291 --> 09:02.166
I'll hose, you scrape.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.083
Can't I hose?

09:03.125 --> 09:04.583
You've got to earn the hose.

09:05.333 --> 09:08.375
Okay, I am everyday

09:05.333 --> 09:08.375
customer. Ready?

09:08.417 --> 09:09.709
I guess so.

09:15.333 --> 09:17.041
-Hello.

09:17.083 --> 09:20.333
Beautiful store you have.

09:17.083 --> 09:20.333
You must be very successful.

09:20.625 --> 09:24.041
I am a hungry man.

09:20.625 --> 09:24.041
Give to me two can pop,

09:24.083 --> 09:26.834
one bag chip, and gum.

09:24.083 --> 09:26.834
How much?

09:26.875 --> 09:28.000
Oh, uh...

09:28.750 --> 09:31.166
-That would be...

09:28.750 --> 09:31.166
-(MIMICS BUZZER) Wrong.

09:31.208 --> 09:32.333
Three question.

09:32.375 --> 09:34.041
You have to know

09:32.375 --> 09:34.041
what kind pop,

09:34.083 --> 09:36.709
which size chip,

09:34.083 --> 09:36.709
which brand gum.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.417
All different price, Gerald.

09:38.458 --> 09:39.959
Right, I'm sorry, Mr Kim.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.625
I didn't get a very good look

09:40.000 --> 09:42.625
at your imaginary chip bag.

09:42.667 --> 09:43.875
(DOOR OPENS)

09:47.458 --> 09:50.166
Could I get a pack of Graydon

09:47.458 --> 09:50.166
Extra Milds, please?

09:50.208 --> 09:53.166
Stop! You forgot to ask ID.

09:53.208 --> 09:55.750
But she's clearly very old...

09:55.792 --> 09:57.959
Enough for

09:55.792 --> 09:57.959
the product. I think.

09:58.291 --> 10:00.083
Hard to tell how old she is.

10:00.375 --> 10:02.959
Hey, I'm 40 and

10:00.375 --> 10:02.959
proud of it, you know.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.667
40? What you talking?

10:03.000 --> 10:06.667
I think you is 25.

10:06.709 --> 10:08.125
Thank you, Mr Kim.

10:08.667 --> 10:11.542
Oh, yeah. I can see now.

10:11.917 --> 10:14.458
Lots of little crack.

10:11.917 --> 10:14.458
Like broken eggshell.

10:14.500 --> 10:15.625
See?

10:16.166 --> 10:17.834
We can move this along,

10:16.166 --> 10:17.834
you know?

10:17.875 --> 10:20.709

10:17.875 --> 10:20.709
Fast! Gerald!

Soon to be old employee.

10:28.250 --> 10:29.333
What?

10:30.542 --> 10:32.458
-Okay, see you.

10:32.834 --> 10:35.083
-Gerald! What you doing?

10:32.834 --> 10:35.083
-Appa!

10:35.125 --> 10:37.542
Don't be angry.

10:35.125 --> 10:37.542
It's his first day.

10:37.583 --> 10:39.083
Gerald is not problem.

10:39.125 --> 10:42.125
He walk like problem, he talk

10:39.125 --> 10:42.125
like problem, he is problem.

10:42.166 --> 10:43.375
-You is problem.

10:42.166 --> 10:43.375
-What?

10:43.417 --> 10:44.875
You make him nervous.

10:45.166 --> 10:47.750
Go, leave Gerald with me.

10:45.166 --> 10:47.750
I train.

10:47.792 --> 10:52.375
Okay, but if whole store

10:47.792 --> 10:52.375
is destroy, I blame you.

10:52.417 --> 10:53.709
Go, go. Go!

10:57.792 --> 10:59.125
Thanks, Mrs Kim,

10:57.792 --> 10:59.125
you really...

10:59.166 --> 11:01.583
Okay, store is not

10:59.166 --> 11:01.583
mop itself. Get busy. Hmm?

11:12.625 --> 11:13.709
Hey.

11:14.208 --> 11:15.792
-How's it going?

11:14.208 --> 11:15.792
-Great.

11:15.834 --> 11:16.917
Great.

11:17.542 --> 11:19.083
Just one little thing.

11:19.500 --> 11:21.625
I need a weekend off.

11:19.500 --> 11:21.625
This weekend.

11:22.625 --> 11:24.625
You need your first

11:22.625 --> 11:24.625
weekend off?

11:24.667 --> 11:25.750
The reason I needed this job

11:25.792 --> 11:27.625
was so I could buy

11:25.792 --> 11:27.625
a ticket to WayHome.

11:27.667 --> 11:29.208
You know it's going to be

11:27.667 --> 11:29.208
a couple of weeks

11:29.250 --> 11:30.625
before you get

11:29.250 --> 11:30.625
your first paycheque.

11:30.667 --> 11:31.500
Oh.

11:32.375 --> 11:33.542
I also need an advance.

11:34.417 --> 11:35.625
Okay.

11:35.667 --> 11:37.041
I can front you the money

11:35.667 --> 11:37.041
for the concert,

11:37.083 --> 11:38.583
but I can't change

11:37.083 --> 11:38.583
your schedule.

11:38.875 --> 11:40.458
How's it going to look

11:38.875 --> 11:40.458
if the assistant manager

11:40.500 --> 11:41.542
is playing favourites?

11:41.583 --> 11:43.000
Well, it looks awesome

11:41.583 --> 11:43.000
if you're me.

11:43.041 --> 11:44.458
I can't do it.

11:44.500 --> 11:46.291
You're gonna have to find

11:44.500 --> 11:46.291
someone to take your shift.

11:46.333 --> 11:47.542
Okay.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.250
Jung.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.542
I'm already

11:49.291 --> 11:50.542
working the counter.

11:53.542 --> 11:54.625
Don't ask Shannon.

11:54.667 --> 11:56.000
She's too nice,

11:54.667 --> 11:56.000
she'll say yes.

11:56.542 --> 11:58.166
I'm not going to ask Shannon.

12:03.792 --> 12:05.417
-Nothing.

Oh, I meant to get salsa, too.

Thought you might say that.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.417
That'll be $10.25.

-How you do that?

12:17.625 --> 12:19.500
-Do what?

12:19.542 --> 12:20.875
Fix Gerald!

12:21.208 --> 12:22.792
Okay, see you.

12:22.834 --> 12:25.542
I just talk to him.

He is a smart boy,

12:25.583 --> 12:28.625
and fast learner,

12:25.583 --> 12:28.625
you just have to be nice.

12:28.667 --> 12:29.875
I am nice.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.583
Then be more nice.

12:39.291 --> 12:40.625
Gerald!

12:43.500 --> 12:46.333
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It was

13:20.709 --> 13:22.208
to switch shifts,

13:22.250 --> 13:23.291
and I'm not having

13:22.250 --> 13:23.291
much luck.

Is that all?

13:26.709 --> 13:27.959

13:33.333 --> 13:35.542

13:35.583 --> 13:36.709
Stop.

13:38.834 --> 13:41.667

13:38.834 --> 13:41.667
to see Destiny's Child

13:41.709 --> 13:43.250
and I passed it up

13:41.709 --> 13:43.250
because of "school."

13:47.000 --> 13:48.625
I thought I could catch them

13:47.000 --> 13:48.625
on the next tour,

13:48.667 --> 13:49.792
but I think

13:48.667 --> 13:49.792
you know what happened.

13:49.834 --> 13:51.458
You can still see Beyonce.

13:51.500 --> 13:53.333

you're really nice.

Interesting.

14:13.417 --> 14:14.500
You wanted to see me?

Yes. I was wondering if you

14:15.875 --> 14:18.166
could work this weekend.

Oh. Sure.

It was Jung.

What's this?

15:38.917 --> 15:40.834
It's for the milk

15:38.917 --> 15:40.834
and cereal I just used.

15:40.875 --> 15:42.917
Looks like lots of milk.

16:40.166 --> 16:41.750

16:41.792 --> 16:43.542
What? He told Shannon

16:41.792 --> 16:43.542
it was fine.

16:43.583 --> 16:44.625
Because Shannon's the boss.

16:44.667 --> 16:46.000
Of course

16:44.667 --> 16:46.000
he's not going to say no.

your dirty work for you.

17:01.166 --> 17:02.458
Like, like her.

17:02.500 --> 17:06.166
What? No. Okay.

17:02.500 --> 17:06.166
I'm not even gonna... Not.

(BELL CHIMES)

17:12.458 --> 17:14.917
Gerald.

17:12.458 --> 17:14.917
Five minute early. Good.

17:15.750 --> 17:17.000
We need to talk.

17:17.041 --> 17:18.041
Sure.

17:18.875 --> 17:22.041
Gerald, you good boy.

17:18.875 --> 17:22.041
Hard worker.

17:22.083 --> 17:25.625
It's not your fault

17:22.083 --> 17:25.625
you are terrible at this job.

17:25.875 --> 17:27.959
To be fair, I'm only terrible

17:25.875 --> 17:27.959
when you're around.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.667
To be fair, it's my store.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.667
I'm around.

17:31.041 --> 17:32.333
Okay, that is fair.

17:32.792 --> 17:34.208
Wait. Are you firing me?

17:35.000 --> 17:38.041
I give to you one week pay.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.041
But yeah.

17:39.667 --> 17:40.834
What's that?

17:42.208 --> 17:44.333
It's my letter of resignation.

17:42.208 --> 17:44.333
I was about to quit.

17:44.375 --> 17:47.166
Oh, okay, you quit.

17:44.375 --> 17:47.166
No severance.

17:47.208 --> 17:48.125
But you fired me first.

17:48.166 --> 17:49.333
When you write letter?

17:50.583 --> 17:52.208
See, that's kind of why

17:52.250 --> 17:53.583
I didn't want to work

17:52.250 --> 17:53.583
here any more.

17:54.625 --> 17:55.750
Okay, okay.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.125
This is nice.

18:04.166 --> 18:05.917
See? I can be nice.

18:11.125 --> 18:13.000
Yeah, I'm just gonna go.

18:15.959 --> 18:17.208
Can I talk to you for a sec?

18:17.250 --> 18:19.041
Sure, what's up, Jan?

18:19.291 --> 18:22.000
Hey, Jan and Shan,

18:19.291 --> 18:22.000
just a couple of work buds.

18:23.583 --> 18:24.667
What's up?

18:24.709 --> 18:25.875
Actually.

18:27.709 --> 18:29.083
I'm going to work Saturday.

18:29.333 --> 18:31.458
Terence had plans.

18:29.333 --> 18:31.458
He was just being nice.

18:31.709 --> 18:33.125
He should have just

18:31.709 --> 18:33.125
said something.

18:33.166 --> 18:34.500
He wasn't going

18:33.166 --> 18:34.500
to say it to you.

18:34.959 --> 18:36.792
And I'm sorry for getting

18:34.959 --> 18:36.792
you involved.

18:37.208 --> 18:38.291
No harm, no foul.

18:38.333 --> 18:39.917
Well, just wanted to

18:38.333 --> 18:39.917
clear that up.

18:43.959 --> 18:46.542
Sometimes it feels good

18:43.959 --> 18:46.542
to say what you think.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.250
'Cause maybe you're nervous

18:46.834 --> 18:49.250
and you don't want to say it.

18:49.291 --> 18:51.959
Janet, I would

18:49.291 --> 18:51.959
love to be friends.

18:52.667 --> 18:54.458
Oh... Okay.

18:54.959 --> 18:56.125
Me too.

18:56.792 --> 18:58.834
But just think about

18:56.792 --> 18:58.834
what I said

18:58.875 --> 19:02.500
and apply it to

18:58.875 --> 19:02.500
all aspects of your life.

19:03.542 --> 19:04.709
Okay.

19:06.166 --> 19:08.250
That's very general advice,

19:06.166 --> 19:08.250
but that can be good too.

19:21.375 --> 19:22.542
Janet.

19:23.041 --> 19:24.125
Hey, Appa.

19:25.834 --> 19:27.834
Okay. Ten.

19:28.709 --> 19:29.834
Huh?

19:30.375 --> 19:31.917
That's what I pay Gerald.

19:32.417 --> 19:34.041
That's less than minimum wage.

19:34.083 --> 19:35.500
But free snack.

19:35.792 --> 19:38.083
I don't know, Appa. I've

19:35.792 --> 19:38.083
already got a pretty good job.

19:38.125 --> 19:39.917
I need a better reason

19:38.125 --> 19:39.917
than free snacks.

19:40.250 --> 19:42.417
Okay. What you want?

19:43.834 --> 19:44.917
You're asking me what I want?

19:45.166 --> 19:46.417
Seriously?

19:46.458 --> 19:47.834
Serious face.

19:47.875 --> 19:49.750
Well, as long as

19:47.875 --> 19:49.750
you're asking,

19:50.166 --> 19:52.458
I want coffee breaks.

19:50.166 --> 19:52.458
I like coffee breaks now.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.041
We have a coffee maker.

19:54.083 --> 19:55.709
I'm talking about

19:54.083 --> 19:55.709
where I get a coffee,

19:55.750 --> 19:57.875
I enjoy the coffee,

19:55.750 --> 19:57.875
then I come back to work.

19:58.583 --> 20:01.166
-Okay, one break.

19:58.583 --> 20:01.166
-Two.

20:01.208 --> 20:03.000
One break, two coffees.

20:03.041 --> 20:04.125
Appa...

20:05.375 --> 20:07.083
I want to feel appreciated.

20:09.083 --> 20:09.917
Okay.

20:19.125 --> 20:20.083
-Hello.

20:20.333 --> 20:22.083
Hi. Do you have

20:20.333 --> 20:22.083
any 1%?

20:22.125 --> 20:24.333
Yeah, just have delivery.

20:22.125 --> 20:24.333
It's in the back.

20:24.375 --> 20:27.458
-Janet, go get.

20:24.375 --> 20:27.458
-I'd love to, but I'm on

20:24.375 --> 20:27.458
my first coffee break.

20:27.792 --> 20:29.125
-Really?

20:27.792 --> 20:29.125
-Uh-huh.

20:29.166 --> 20:30.667
Okay, see you.

20:34.083 --> 20:35.125
You want a job?

20:41.125 --> 20:42.500
JUNG: Hey, Shannon.

20:43.667 --> 20:45.000
Sorry about my sister.

20:45.041 --> 20:46.333
I mean,

20:45.041 --> 20:46.333
I thought she'd at least

20:46.375 --> 20:48.083
-make it through the month.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.083
-Yeah, it's a shame.

20:49.583 --> 20:51.709
I'm just going to throw

20:49.583 --> 20:51.709
something out there.

20:55.625 --> 20:57.500
Lunch buddies should

20:55.625 --> 20:57.500
order in today.

20:57.750 --> 20:59.417
Yeah, sure. That sounds great.

21:00.667 --> 21:02.000
What do you think about Thai?

21:02.041 --> 21:03.125
I love Thai.

21:05.834 --> 21:08.125
Did you want to say

21:05.834 --> 21:08.125
something else?

21:09.166 --> 21:11.000
Uh, I don't think so.

21:11.041 --> 21:13.333
Unless there was something

21:11.041 --> 21:13.333
else you wanted me to say?

21:15.083 --> 21:16.166
No, no.

21:17.083 --> 21:19.083
Great, I'll Thai it up.
