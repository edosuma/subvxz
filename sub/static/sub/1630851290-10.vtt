00:08.921 --> 00:10.662
- <i>Previously on</i> Chapelwaite...

00:10.793 --> 00:12.751
You said the only way
to be rid of your curse

00:12.882 --> 00:16.277
was to return it to the undead.
It's with Mary Dennison.

00:16.407 --> 00:18.453
I'm coming for you, demon.
I'll have your head.

00:18.583 --> 00:19.758
<i>
I saw my father last night.</i>

00:19.889 --> 00:22.283
It can't be.
Is it really you?

00:22.413 --> 00:23.762
Cousin Stephen
is still out there.

00:23.893 --> 00:25.155
<i>You know what he's capable of.</i>

00:25.286 --> 00:26.983
No!

00:27.114 --> 00:29.768
- I gave her the book.
- Loa!

00:29.899 --> 00:33.946
De Vermis Mysteriis <i>
has found its way home.</i>

00:34.077 --> 00:35.513
Who do you have there?

00:35.644 --> 00:36.384
It's Mary.

00:36.514 --> 00:37.602
Let me go!

00:40.997 --> 00:43.782
- George!
- Save me.

00:43.913 --> 00:47.699
<i>To become undead,
you drink the vampire's blood. </i>

00:47.830 --> 00:51.834
<i>When you die,
you return like them. </i>

00:51.964 --> 00:54.793
We're riding to Jerusalem's Lot
to fight Jakub.

00:54.924 --> 00:58.710
Once I open this book,
it must not be closed.

00:58.841 --> 01:01.278
They will plunge our world
into darkness.

01:01.409 --> 01:02.932
<i>Every one of us will die.</i>

01:03.063 --> 01:06.240
<i>Each page must
be read to raise the Worm. </i>

01:08.503 --> 01:09.895
It's begun.

03:41.133 --> 03:42.439
Child.

03:44.876 --> 03:46.487
You made this possible.

03:47.923 --> 03:49.794
Come...

03:49.925 --> 03:52.667
Stand with me, daughter.

03:58.803 --> 04:00.544
Read the Latin.

04:02.981 --> 04:06.028
When the last page is turned,

04:06.158 --> 04:09.771
we will welcome
the dark together

04:09.901 --> 04:12.513
for all eternity.

04:15.777 --> 04:19.694
<i>O gloriose</i>

04:19.824 --> 04:22.262
<i>Non-nominande,</i>

04:23.567 --> 04:26.744
<i>a tenebris exsurge.</i>

04:31.314 --> 04:36.406
<i>Foedatus est a genere
impurissimo mundus tuus. </i>

04:40.671 --> 04:42.282
No time to spare.

04:44.806 --> 04:45.676
Let's go.

04:47.809 --> 04:51.508
<i>Obliviscet
canis magistri sui. </i>

04:53.293 --> 04:56.905
<i>Servus gradum proprium discet.</i>

05:19.797 --> 05:21.408
Burn it.

05:22.626 --> 05:23.714
<i>Decede.</i>

05:24.846 --> 05:26.717
<i>Decede.</i>

05:26.848 --> 05:28.328
<i>Decede.</i>

05:40.601 --> 05:41.776
Oh, dear God.

05:53.004 --> 05:54.441
Prepare yourselves.

06:05.669 --> 06:07.541
Christ almighty.

06:19.161 --> 06:20.641
They're behind us!

06:46.797 --> 06:48.016
There's one behind you!
He's coming!

06:48.146 --> 06:49.800
The heart.

06:49.931 --> 06:51.802
Strike the heart!

06:51.933 --> 06:54.022
- Stay back!

07:12.170 --> 07:12.910
Come on!

07:20.178 --> 07:21.049
There's more!

07:21.179 --> 07:23.051
Get to the trees!

07:23.660 --> 07:25.793
- Rebecca!

07:25.923 --> 07:27.447
Rebecca!

07:28.056 --> 07:29.492
George!

07:30.145 --> 07:31.625
Come on.

07:31.755 --> 07:33.714
Stay with me.

07:33.844 --> 07:34.758
Let's go!

07:56.954 --> 07:58.478
Stay away!

08:02.960 --> 08:04.484
It's you!

08:05.876 --> 08:07.530
Daughter.

08:10.794 --> 08:11.926
No!

08:14.972 --> 08:17.671
Drink and live.

08:18.846 --> 08:19.803
No.

08:21.196 --> 08:22.937
What happened to you?

08:23.720 --> 08:27.507
How...
how could you do this?

08:30.292 --> 08:32.120
You brought Jakub to Maine.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.731
Make it right, Father.

08:34.862 --> 08:36.516
Help us!

08:37.299 --> 08:38.648
Think about Mother.

08:41.259 --> 08:42.609
Me.

08:46.264 --> 08:48.876
Is there any man
left inside you?

08:50.399 --> 08:51.879
Surely you must
feel something?

08:53.924 --> 08:56.536
I feel as much
as I choose to.

09:00.278 --> 09:02.672
Last chance.

09:06.284 --> 09:07.808
No.

09:10.071 --> 09:12.726
All my life,
I made excuses for you.

09:12.856 --> 09:14.815
You didn't deserve it.

09:16.207 --> 09:18.949
You truly are just
a selfish coward.

09:21.038 --> 09:24.041
I'm content with my choices.

09:24.172 --> 09:26.957
I doubt you'll feel
the same way about yours.

10:02.210 --> 10:03.733
What is that?

10:23.710 --> 10:24.841
- Let's get out of here.

10:35.896 --> 10:37.114
They're alive!

10:46.036 --> 10:47.647
What's happening
out there?

10:49.344 --> 10:50.824
There must've been others.

10:53.391 --> 10:54.871
George...

10:56.003 --> 10:58.135
This is it for you.

10:58.266 --> 11:00.181
I want you to stay here.

11:00.311 --> 11:02.139
I'll make a run
for the door.

11:02.270 --> 11:04.881
No, there's too many.
You won't make it.

11:05.012 --> 11:07.841
- I have to try.
- Wait.

11:11.148 --> 11:13.716
Here. Take this.

11:14.456 --> 11:16.066
You might need it.

11:19.591 --> 11:22.159
I hope to see my wife
again shortly.

11:28.383 --> 11:29.950
I hope you do, too.

11:38.610 --> 11:40.700
Come on!

11:41.396 --> 11:43.354
Come on, demons!

11:46.009 --> 11:47.881
Come on! Come on!

11:51.406 --> 11:54.365
Come on, you!

12:10.207 --> 12:12.862
Loa!
Get away from him.

12:12.993 --> 12:14.908
Oh, Whaler.

12:15.038 --> 12:17.214
Jakub, I want that book.

12:17.345 --> 12:19.129
You broke your word.

12:21.436 --> 12:23.960
You were supposed
to bring it to me.

12:24.091 --> 12:28.791
I mistook you
for a better man.

12:29.879 --> 12:34.057
Now, you give me that book
and I'll let you live.

12:34.188 --> 12:37.931
You can have Jerusalem's Lot
for your own.

12:38.061 --> 12:39.933
We can coexist in peace.

12:42.239 --> 12:43.937
That's my offer.

12:44.067 --> 12:45.895
You refuse, you die.

12:47.114 --> 12:49.420
We already exist
in your world,

12:49.551 --> 12:51.945
but it is no life.

12:53.555 --> 12:57.994
We hide in shadows,

12:58.125 --> 13:00.127
feed like scavengers.

13:01.389 --> 13:03.086
But no more.

13:04.566 --> 13:06.220
Now it is your turn.

13:07.482 --> 13:10.050
Then you choose death.

13:10.180 --> 13:11.094
Kill him.

13:19.189 --> 13:20.190
No, Loa.

13:24.064 --> 13:25.065
Loa.

13:26.588 --> 13:29.286
Don't you listen to him.

13:29.417 --> 13:31.027
He's a deceiver.

13:34.335 --> 13:35.989
That monster
does not care about you.

13:37.077 --> 13:38.208
And you do?

13:40.210 --> 13:42.125
Loa. Stop.

13:42.256 --> 13:43.126
Stop now.

13:46.173 --> 13:47.827
This is for Mother.

14:09.326 --> 14:11.459
- Whaler...

14:11.589 --> 14:13.853
Father!

14:16.290 --> 14:17.073
Aah!

14:25.603 --> 14:28.911
I'm going to
bleed you, whaler.

14:30.565 --> 14:35.918
Now you will know
what it is to be Leviathan.

15:05.295 --> 15:07.254
You wanted to bring
the darkness.

15:08.516 --> 15:10.387
Well, here it comes.

15:12.215 --> 15:14.000
- Ah!

15:20.528 --> 15:22.312
Loa.

15:23.705 --> 15:26.316
You have to hide.

15:27.665 --> 15:30.625
You have to.
hide behind there.

15:30.755 --> 15:32.235
I'll come back for you.

15:32.366 --> 15:34.020
Go now.

15:44.856 --> 15:46.293
Charles!

16:05.616 --> 16:06.966
Stephen!

16:07.575 --> 16:09.185
Stop!

16:09.316 --> 16:11.274
The coming of the dark.

16:13.494 --> 16:15.278
It's even more beautiful
than I imagined.

16:16.540 --> 16:17.541
No more.

16:17.672 --> 16:19.456
Look at us.

16:19.587 --> 16:22.198
We're not so different, cousin.

16:22.329 --> 16:24.331
Haven't we both
lost enough?

16:26.376 --> 16:28.030
You're the only
family I've got.

16:29.292 --> 16:31.425
Let's end this fight

16:31.555 --> 16:33.470
and welcome
the Worm together.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.429
Never.

16:35.559 --> 16:37.170
You're a fool.

16:38.519 --> 16:40.303
Your father
feared the book.

16:41.478 --> 16:43.089
He was weak.

16:43.219 --> 16:45.004
Like you.

16:46.570 --> 16:48.137
- Don't do it, Stephen!
- It's over!

16:48.268 --> 16:49.660
<i>Resurgemus.</i>

16:49.791 --> 16:51.488
- <i>Resurgemus!
</i>

18:05.388 --> 18:07.390
Get up, you bastard.

18:09.479 --> 18:10.437
Cousin...

18:10.567 --> 18:12.091
Get up.

18:17.574 --> 18:20.447
Blood calls blood, cousin.

19:25.555 --> 19:27.166
Oh...

19:28.776 --> 19:32.171
Loa. Come.

19:50.450 --> 19:51.538
Loa.

19:56.630 --> 19:58.240
Loa, come out.

20:07.684 --> 20:09.295
Loa.

20:11.514 --> 20:12.602
It's all right.
It's over.

20:16.824 --> 20:18.347
You're safe.

20:20.828 --> 20:22.438
Come.

20:44.678 --> 20:46.288
I'm sorry.

20:46.984 --> 20:48.551
I am, too.

20:53.643 --> 20:54.688
Come.

21:00.998 --> 21:02.391
Come home.

21:12.923 --> 21:14.708
Mister Boone!

21:16.536 --> 21:17.537
Mister Boone!

21:22.890 --> 21:23.804
Where are the others?

21:23.934 --> 21:26.285
It's just us now.

21:48.742 --> 21:51.788
Leave no trace
of this godforsaken place.

23:01.554 --> 23:03.077
Able.

23:03.207 --> 23:05.645
- Where's Father?
- He's okay.

23:05.775 --> 23:07.734
Don't worry. We're
to meet him at the house.

23:07.864 --> 23:09.997
Oh! Rebecca!

23:10.127 --> 23:11.738
Oh, thank God!

23:11.868 --> 23:12.869
It's over.

23:15.829 --> 23:17.874
It was him.

23:18.005 --> 23:19.659
Father's gone...

23:20.964 --> 23:21.791
for good now.

23:28.058 --> 23:29.582
They won't want to see me.

23:32.062 --> 23:33.586
They'll be scared.

23:36.066 --> 23:37.720
They may be at first.

23:39.592 --> 23:41.811
But we'll prove that there's
nothing to be frightened of.

23:50.994 --> 23:52.605
Father!

23:53.301 --> 23:55.651
- Oh! Ooh.

23:55.782 --> 23:57.261
You did it!
I knew you would!

23:57.392 --> 23:59.002
I was so worried.

23:59.133 --> 24:00.830
It's good to see you both.

24:02.136 --> 24:04.834
Hello, Honor. Tane.

24:10.144 --> 24:11.798
What is she doing here?

24:13.930 --> 24:15.454
She has the book.

24:16.193 --> 24:17.630
Yes.

24:17.760 --> 24:19.849
It has to be with her kind.

24:21.285 --> 24:22.939
That's what keeps us well.

24:26.247 --> 24:27.857
Loa's home now.

24:36.997 --> 24:39.782
Tane, we'll need
water to wash.

24:39.913 --> 24:42.655
Honor, take the horses
to the stable.

24:42.785 --> 24:44.526
Go on.

24:45.309 --> 24:47.616
- Rebecca...
- Tane.

24:47.747 --> 24:48.835
Tane, come with me.

24:48.965 --> 24:50.663
Go on.

24:56.277 --> 24:57.757
They don't want me.

24:59.149 --> 25:00.803
That will change.

25:03.240 --> 25:04.894
Why don't you go
up to your room?

25:07.070 --> 25:08.681
Go on now.

25:16.123 --> 25:17.646
She's right, Father.

25:19.126 --> 25:20.693
I don't trust her.

25:22.216 --> 25:26.002
- She's your sister.
- No, she's not.

25:26.133 --> 25:28.483
Not anymore.

25:28.614 --> 25:30.703
Loa's not the one
to be frightened of.

25:30.833 --> 25:32.661
What do you mean?

25:33.836 --> 25:34.924
You think there are others?

25:36.099 --> 25:37.971
I do.

25:38.624 --> 25:40.234
We still have the book.
They'll come for it.

25:40.364 --> 25:41.975
Honor, stable the horses.

25:42.105 --> 25:43.672
- I don't want her here.
- The horses!

25:43.803 --> 25:45.718
Not another word.

26:49.303 --> 26:50.826
<i>Charles...</i>

26:50.957 --> 26:53.960
I know what you're afraid of.

26:54.090 --> 26:56.658
But you are not your father.

26:59.052 --> 27:01.097
<i>You will know what to do.</i>

27:54.324 --> 27:56.849
No, Tane.
She's not one of us anymore.

27:56.979 --> 27:58.938
She helped me before.

27:59.068 --> 28:02.158
I'm afraid.
Will she hurt us?

28:02.289 --> 28:04.857
She can't be trusted.
She's dangerous.

28:07.381 --> 28:10.166
Able, I need a favor.

28:10.297 --> 28:12.125
Anything, Mr. Boone.

28:12.255 --> 28:14.867
Ride to town,
bring Doctor Guilford.

28:16.129 --> 28:17.696
Yes, sir.

28:22.396 --> 28:24.267
Able,

28:24.398 --> 28:25.878
tell him to bring
his medical instruments.

28:27.227 --> 28:28.707
Of course.

28:31.666 --> 28:33.276
Are you hurt, Father?

28:33.407 --> 28:34.930
Nothing to worry about.

28:42.198 --> 28:43.722
Come in.

28:51.381 --> 28:53.209
I'm sorry about your father.

28:55.995 --> 28:57.039
It's funny.

28:58.388 --> 28:59.999
I should feel melancholy,

29:00.129 --> 29:01.870
but mostly
what I feel is liberated.

29:06.005 --> 29:07.876
What now, Charles?

29:10.139 --> 29:11.924
Where do we go from here?

29:31.508 --> 29:34.076
As long as that book exists...

29:37.123 --> 29:38.994
as long as it's out
in the open,

29:39.125 --> 29:41.214
my children's lives
are in danger.

29:44.130 --> 29:46.436
It's only a matter of time
before...

29:46.567 --> 29:49.788
others like Jakub come for it.

29:59.058 --> 30:00.189
There must be a way out.

30:04.237 --> 30:05.151
There is.

30:23.430 --> 30:25.432
<i>It's not
what I would've chosen, </i>

30:25.562 --> 30:27.129
<i>if I thought
there was any other way. </i>

30:31.351 --> 30:32.656
<i>
Don't you worry</i>

30:32.787 --> 30:34.180
<i>what will become of
the children without you? </i>

30:34.310 --> 30:36.138
<i>
Of course I do.</i>

30:37.183 --> 30:39.315
<i>But I know what will become
of them if I don't do this. </i>

30:43.319 --> 30:47.193
I have a chance to free
Honor and Tane from this curse.

30:48.585 --> 30:50.979
They can create
their own destiny.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.941
Maybe someday they will...

30:58.204 --> 31:00.336
they'll realize that
this is the greatest gift

31:00.467 --> 31:01.990
I could ever give them.

31:06.473 --> 31:09.041
I want you to know
I will always watch over them.

31:11.608 --> 31:13.872
Whether they
want me to or not.

31:16.396 --> 31:18.050
They will.

31:22.663 --> 31:24.273
They've grown to love you,

31:26.319 --> 31:28.103
as have I.

31:32.455 --> 31:34.980
This should be
the beginning of our story.

31:38.374 --> 31:40.986
Perhaps someday you'll write
a better ending for us.

31:43.510 --> 31:45.207
I hope you will.

32:29.338 --> 32:30.252
Honor.

32:32.341 --> 32:33.212
Tane.

32:34.430 --> 32:36.084
Tane, wake up.

32:36.215 --> 32:37.433
What is it?

32:41.568 --> 32:43.091
Is everything okay?

32:47.617 --> 32:49.445
We need to speak.

33:23.349 --> 33:24.480
Loa?

33:33.707 --> 33:35.404
It's all right.

34:02.605 --> 34:04.346
I know what
you want me to do.

34:07.393 --> 34:09.482
I won't.

34:09.612 --> 34:11.745
I won't do it.

34:11.875 --> 34:14.269
The book needs
to be hidden.

34:15.357 --> 34:18.186
It needs to be kept
from those like Jakub.

34:18.317 --> 34:20.188
It needs a keeper.

34:23.496 --> 34:26.151
Someone who will guard it
from the world.

34:28.414 --> 34:31.982
I'll keep it,
then you'll be okay.

34:32.113 --> 34:33.462
That's not
your responsibility.

34:47.563 --> 34:49.391
I know how difficult this is.

34:50.653 --> 34:52.090
I have to do it.

34:52.655 --> 34:54.092
No.

34:56.311 --> 34:57.921
I made a mistake.

34:58.052 --> 35:00.359
I did it to hurt you.

35:01.534 --> 35:03.231
I wish I could take it back.

35:05.320 --> 35:06.452
You're not to blame.

35:07.931 --> 35:10.108
I should've protected you.

35:14.242 --> 35:18.420
A father's job is to
look after his children.

35:20.683 --> 35:22.250
I failed you.

35:24.470 --> 35:26.472
The guilt that I carry
for that is...

35:28.648 --> 35:30.128
bottomless.

35:33.740 --> 35:36.395
I don't want you to live
the way I have to.

35:39.485 --> 35:41.574
It's terrible in the dark.

35:41.704 --> 35:44.316
- Loa...
- No!

35:44.446 --> 35:47.319
Please listen.

35:47.449 --> 35:49.147
Think of your sister.

35:51.584 --> 35:53.281
Think of your brother.

35:55.370 --> 35:56.458
This book...

35:57.938 --> 35:59.505
will be a plague on them...

36:01.724 --> 36:04.466
until one way or another,
it takes their lives.

36:20.830 --> 36:22.441
Take me with you.

36:25.444 --> 36:27.272
It'll be too dangerous.

36:30.840 --> 36:32.320
You're safer here.

36:33.539 --> 36:34.670
No one will know of you.

36:36.759 --> 36:38.283
It's the only way.

36:59.521 --> 37:01.393
I forgive you, Father.

37:54.576 --> 37:55.664
<i>I love you.</i>

37:55.795 --> 37:57.666
Not for a moment
have I ever not.

39:11.784 --> 39:12.741
Loa.

39:17.006 --> 39:18.660
You've done it, then?

40:38.000 --> 40:39.437
Rebecca.

40:40.742 --> 40:42.440
You should go now.

40:45.007 --> 40:47.445
This is something
you should not see.

42:01.780 --> 42:02.824
That's enough.

42:04.957 --> 42:07.960
It only has to appear
as though we buried them.

42:31.374 --> 42:33.159
If you
don't want to remain here,

42:33.289 --> 42:34.943
where would you want to go?

42:36.292 --> 42:38.294
Nuka Hiva.

42:38.425 --> 42:41.080
It's not
that simple, Tane.

42:41.210 --> 42:44.039
There's an opportunity
for us here.

42:44.170 --> 42:45.867
A home. A business.

42:49.088 --> 42:51.699
What about you, Rebecca?

42:51.830 --> 42:53.179
What will you do?

42:53.309 --> 42:56.356
You'll live with us,
won't you?

42:56.486 --> 42:59.838
For a time,
if you'd like.

42:59.968 --> 43:01.883
Or until you can
no longer stand me.

43:03.624 --> 43:05.626
You're our family now.

43:09.064 --> 43:10.675
Dr. Guilford.

43:22.948 --> 43:25.733
Your father's
death certificate.

43:30.869 --> 43:32.000
Heart failure.

43:36.570 --> 43:38.659
His secret dies with me.

43:42.184 --> 43:43.708
Good night.

45:37.517 --> 45:40.955
<i>Father says
we have nothing to be afraid of. </i>

45:41.086 --> 45:43.175
But how do I know
I can fully trust her?

45:44.872 --> 45:47.005
I spoke with one of them
in Jerusalem's Lot.

45:48.093 --> 45:50.225
Far worse than Loa.

45:50.356 --> 45:53.751
I asked him if there was
any man left inside him.

45:55.143 --> 45:57.319
And he told me
he felt as much

45:57.450 --> 45:59.191
or as little as he chose to.

46:01.367 --> 46:03.761
Loa is choosing you.

46:06.198 --> 46:08.287
My hope is that you can
find it within yourself

46:08.417 --> 46:10.202
to love her
as you once did.

46:10.332 --> 46:11.638
She betrayed us.

46:11.769 --> 46:13.988
And for that
she lost everything.

46:15.511 --> 46:17.165
More than
you could ever take.

46:28.437 --> 46:29.917
It's all right.

46:31.136 --> 46:32.964
We have to show him strength.

47:22.230 --> 47:25.233
Sir, I'll leave you
to your family.

47:26.495 --> 47:27.975
It's been a privilege.

47:30.369 --> 47:31.892
The privilege is mine.

47:33.459 --> 47:35.026
You're a good man, Able.

47:35.156 --> 47:37.202
Thank you, Mr. Boone.

47:37.332 --> 47:39.247
Come with me.
I'll walk you out.

48:04.359 --> 48:05.273
My children.

48:08.668 --> 48:15.283
Saying goodbye to you

48:15.414 --> 48:17.372
is the hardest thing
I'll ever have to do.

48:22.595 --> 48:24.162
Take care of one another.

48:25.511 --> 48:27.905
Be kind, compassionate.

48:28.731 --> 48:31.038
And if life separates you,

48:32.822 --> 48:34.912
always find your way
back to each other.

48:36.435 --> 48:39.960
Never let distance or
words come between you.

48:47.272 --> 48:49.013
Son.

48:54.540 --> 48:56.542
Set your own course.

48:56.672 --> 48:59.414
Be true to that course.

49:00.154 --> 49:05.420
Let no person, misfortune,
deviate you from it.

49:05.551 --> 49:08.162
Leave an indelible mark
upon this world.

49:11.731 --> 49:14.342
I won't disappoint you.

49:20.435 --> 49:22.046
Honor.

49:24.744 --> 49:26.964
You're so brave.

49:29.183 --> 49:30.141
And strong.

49:31.403 --> 49:33.013
And beautiful.

49:34.841 --> 49:37.104
Your mother
would've been proud.

49:47.332 --> 49:49.247
Watch over your sister.

49:49.377 --> 49:51.118
Please.

51:07.368 --> 51:09.153
I'll see you again!

51:10.284 --> 51:12.069
Out there.

51:20.381 --> 51:22.209
I'll be looking for you.

52:32.801 --> 52:34.629
Father!

52:38.894 --> 52:41.462
I love you!

52:54.780 --> 52:57.652
<i>On that strip
of weathered Maine sand, </i>

52:57.783 --> 52:59.741
<i>I watched
as the sea reclaimed </i>

52:59.872 --> 53:01.613
<i>the only man
I've ever loved... </i>

53:03.005 --> 53:04.485
<i>...the sullen white surf</i>

53:04.616 --> 53:07.009
<i>washing him back
where he belonged... </i>

53:07.140 --> 53:10.491
<i>leaving no trail nor care
for all we'd lost. </i>

53:12.580 --> 53:13.538
Let's go.

53:16.845 --> 53:19.631
<i>Charles Boone's
absence is as raw today </i>

53:19.761 --> 53:22.503
<i>as it was
that ill-fated night. </i>

53:23.374 --> 53:27.421
<i>But I find comfort in
the presence of his children, </i>

53:27.552 --> 53:30.598
<i>Honor, Loa, Tane.</i>

53:37.779 --> 53:39.607
<i>In the end,</i>

53:39.738 --> 53:42.219
<i>it was love
that vanquished evil. </i>

53:43.698 --> 53:46.875
<i>And good grew,
like seedlings, </i>

53:47.006 --> 53:49.226
<i>from the ash.</i>
