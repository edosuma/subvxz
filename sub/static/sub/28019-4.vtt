21:52.240 --> 21:53.810
Too good for a man like Sandro.

21:53.850 --> 21:55.500
You know the Ravenzos well, don't you?

21:55.550 --> 21:57.860
Everyone in Italy knows
the Ravenzos well.

21:57.900 --> 22:00.470
When you came by the house,
I noticed a closeness

22:00.510 --> 22:02.820
between you and Francesca.

22:02.860 --> 22:04.990
Maternal, even.

22:06.990 --> 22:09.700
The Ravenzos took my family
in after World War II.

22:09.800 --> 22:12.080
When everyone was
starving and destitute,

22:12.170 --> 22:14.310
the Ravenzos gave my grandparents work,

22:14.350 --> 22:16.480
a place to live.

22:16.530 --> 22:20.010
And when my parents died,
Francesca took me in

22:20.050 --> 22:22.480
and raised me alongside
her own children.

22:22.540 --> 22:24.760
The woman is a saint.

22:24.880 --> 22:29.280
But I was alive for the Brigate Rosse.

22:29.300 --> 22:31.150
I watched as they extorted

22:31.190 --> 22:33.330
the privileged of our
country for ransom.

22:33.370 --> 22:35.280
Held our government hostage.

22:35.300 --> 22:39.330
This type of negotiation
was banned for a reason.

22:39.370 --> 22:41.940
But you've seen my website.
You know what I can do.

22:43.220 --> 22:45.340
With your help, we can ensure
this stays out of the press.

22:45.350 --> 22:48.800
Nobody knows except my team,
the Ravenzos and you.

22:50.560 --> 22:52.300
Hypothetically,

22:52.340 --> 22:54.420
if I were to look the other way...

22:56.440 --> 22:58.179
... what other way would I look?

22:58.180 --> 23:01.120
I need you to do full
forensics on Sandro's car.

23:01.140 --> 23:05.140
Fingerprints, DNA, the works,
and if this was a hit,

23:05.180 --> 23:07.120
now it's an auction for Fiona's life.

23:07.140 --> 23:09.190
If we lose the bid,
identifying the kidnappers,

23:09.230 --> 23:11.280
tracking them down, may
be the only way for us

23:11.320 --> 23:12.680
to bring Fiona back alive.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.400
I'll call you when it's ready.

23:14.410 --> 23:16.930
Okay, thank you.

23:16.940 --> 23:18.960
Mr. Beaumont.

23:20.980 --> 23:25.120
If you in any way take advantage
of Francesca Ravenzo,

23:25.160 --> 23:28.550
being arrested for negotiating ransom

23:28.600 --> 23:30.730
will be the least of your problems.

23:41.760 --> 23:44.000
Hey.

23:44.050 --> 23:46.200
How much did you get?

23:46.220 --> 23:48.360
None.

23:48.400 --> 23:51.060
The million I got earlier
emptied the family trust.

23:51.100 --> 23:52.540
There is no more.

23:52.550 --> 23:55.099
Well, I find it hard to believe
the Ravenzo fashion empire...

23:55.100 --> 23:56.760
What, do you think we are made of money?

23:56.770 --> 23:58.410
Huh?

23:58.450 --> 23:59.480
Is that it?

24:00.980 --> 24:03.019
This new bag, the overhead,

24:03.020 --> 24:05.439
the deliveries, you have no idea.

24:05.440 --> 24:07.270
Ravenzo Luxury Goods is worth a fortune.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.579
I mean, the name alone could
sell for what? Half a billion.

24:09.580 --> 24:11.580
What's going on, Sandro?
Where's the money?

24:12.340 --> 24:13.760
I lost it.

24:14.720 --> 24:16.210
Gambling.

24:17.980 --> 24:20.140
I kept thinking I could win it back

24:20.150 --> 24:22.090
and refill the trust
before anyone noticed,

24:22.130 --> 24:24.020
but I kept losing,

24:24.040 --> 24:26.420
and no bank will touch me now.

You think it's me.

Roberto was a no-show,

24:45.020 --> 24:47.399

And?

24:48.500 --> 24:50.940
He's dead.

24:50.980 --> 24:52.520
CYNTHIA: Suicide.

Either that or a murder made

Get me a statement.

25:00.950 --> 25:02.000
What's going on there?

25:03.430 --> 25:06.040
Were you able to track down
a life insurance policy?

25:06.090 --> 25:08.920
Yeah. Ten million euros.

25:08.960 --> 25:10.480
To who?

25:11.460 --> 25:13.880
The Ravenzo family trust.

25:28.590 --> 25:30.370
Well, Giulia's finally arrived.

25:30.420 --> 25:32.550
She's in the study, working.

25:32.590 --> 25:34.999
Francesca and Sandro are in the kitchen.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.860
Do we really think one of the Ravenzos

25:36.900 --> 25:38.210
is trying to have Fiona killed?

25:38.250 --> 25:39.940
ERIC: Her insurance pays ten million

25:39.960 --> 25:41.540
to the Ravenzo family trust.

25:41.550 --> 25:42.819
Nothing else makes sense.

25:42.820 --> 25:44.740
So if the Ravenzos are our clients,

25:44.780 --> 25:47.040
that means we're in a bidding
war against ourselves.

25:47.090 --> 25:48.350
Yeah, it looks that way.

25:48.390 --> 25:50.400
So? Which Ravenzo is it?

25:50.410 --> 25:52.679
Well, I don't see Francesca
risking her son's life

25:52.680 --> 25:54.040
just to kill his wife.

25:54.080 --> 25:55.740
My vote's for Giulia.

25:55.800 --> 25:57.980
This is the first time
she's been to the house

25:58.000 --> 25:59.270
since Fiona was taken.

25:59.320 --> 26:01.120
CYNTHIA: If the factory fire was arson,

26:01.140 --> 26:02.739
we can assume that Roberto knew...

26:02.740 --> 26:06.780
that's why he led us there...
but what if Fiona knew as well?

26:06.840 --> 26:10.139
Giulia showed me a photograph
of Fiona and Roberto together.

26:10.140 --> 26:11.799
Now, she thought they
were having an affair,

26:11.800 --> 26:14.900
but what if he was telling
her what he found out?

26:14.980 --> 26:16.400
That's when she confronted Giulia,

26:16.410 --> 26:18.279
Giulia puts a hit out on Fiona

26:18.280 --> 26:20.680
to shut her up about the arson.

26:20.900 --> 26:24.520
Makes you wonder what else
these people are capable of.

26:26.470 --> 26:29.260
We're sure that Roberto
wasn't a suicide, right?

26:29.280 --> 26:32.020
Nah, nah. Right when he's
about to blow the whistle

26:32.040 --> 26:34.859
on the Ravenzos for burning
down their own factory,

26:34.860 --> 26:36.790
he takes his own life?

26:36.830 --> 26:39.100
That's too coincidental.

26:39.140 --> 26:41.899
If we're gonna accuse the
people picking up our tab

26:41.900 --> 26:44.100
of murder, I'd really
like to be certain.

26:44.140 --> 26:46.360
Okay, head to the police station.

26:46.380 --> 26:48.240
See if you can get eyes
on that forensics report

26:48.280 --> 26:49.400
from the cop that you met.

26:49.410 --> 26:51.160
S.I. Marmoldo didn't come through?

He practically threatened to
kill me if I touched a hair

26:53.440 --> 26:54.469
on Francesca's head.

26:54.470 --> 26:56.850
Now, if he catches on that

26:56.900 --> 26:58.030
a member of her family,

26:58.070 --> 26:59.760
we may never see that report.

do with Giulia Ravenzo.

I am very interested to see

27:15.370 --> 27:17.870

Look, I have the invoice.

that ox, and I will leave.

27:59.080 --> 28:01.060
- Then we are done.
- Why?

28:01.070 --> 28:02.879
Because you received a better
offer from whoever hired you

28:02.880 --> 28:04.440

What's the number?

28:05.940 --> 28:08.599
One and a quarter million euros.

28:08.600 --> 28:11.020
How much of that money do you
think you'll live to spend?

28:11.040 --> 28:13.220
I am not interested in what-ifs.

anything to offer. Do we?
