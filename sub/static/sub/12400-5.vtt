- You're insane.
- No. No, I disagree.

29:36.233 --> 29:37.769
I think I've made
some real growth.

29:37.943 --> 29:40.810
I'm finally moving on
with my life.

29:40.904 --> 29:43.281

I've seen enough war.

to be a part of something

Yeah, but there are other ways

I picked Up during my time

that I like being a teacher.

What's Nikita going to do, hmm?
Tell the truth?

35:25.290 --> 35:27.656
She's already done that.
Testified before Congress

35:27.834 --> 35:29.199
- and swore it was over.
- Hmm.

35:30.253 --> 35:32.460
You honestly think
She won't recant?

35:32.631 --> 35:35.748
I think the United States government
will never let that happen.

Probably a double, someone who
was coerced into playing Amanda.

35:50.649 --> 35:53.732
Ryan's right. This iS bigger
than MDK and Jones.

35:53.860 --> 35:55.396
Before he died, he told me

35:55.487 --> 35:57.773
there were seven other

- Do we know who they are?
- Not yet, but we'll find out.

36:08.500 --> 36:09.910
The first thing we have to do
iS tell everybody

36:10.085 --> 36:11.746
that we were wrong,
this isn't over.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.160
If we're gonna go public,
we need more than Speculation.

36:13.338 --> 36:16.375
- It'll take time to investigate.
- Time we don't have, Senator.

36:16.549 --> 36:19.586
They almost started World War III.
We know they have doubles in place.

36:19.761 --> 36:21.717
That'S why we can't say
anything without proof.

36:21.888 --> 36:23.298
The kind of panic
thiS could cause,

36:23.473 --> 36:25.634
it would be unlike anything
we've ever seen.

36:25.809 --> 36:28.050

each other of being imposterS,

36:28.228 --> 36:31.186
using it aS an excuse for war,
uprisings, riots.

36:31.356 --> 36:32.641
- It'd be chaos.
- Exactly.

36:33.066 --> 36:34.431
That'S why we can't do nothing.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.229
We will find the truth,

36:36.403 --> 36:38.234
and then we will figure out
what the hell to do with it.

36:38.405 --> 36:40.236
But until then,
we don't tip our hand.

36:40.448 --> 36:41.984
We let them believe
that they've won.

36:42.158 --> 36:44.865
I will not go in there
and lie.

36:45.245 --> 36:46.735
You have to.

36:46.913 --> 36:49.154
The country--
hell, the world needs this.

36:49.332 --> 36:52.540
They need to believe that
the bad guys have been defeated.

36:52.711 --> 36:55.748
They need a hero,
and you're it.

36:56.715 --> 36:58.171

to give me a medal.

- How iS that right?
- You said it yourself.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.091
There are more doubles
out there.

37:09.269 --> 37:10.679

right now.

in how we play this.

- Amanda.
- We will get her.

They wouldn't tell us anything.

38:14.918 --> 38:16.533
They just said
there's been an accident.

38:16.711 --> 38:19.544
When we saw Nikita on television,
we thought maybe he was okay.

38:21.716 --> 38:25.334

aS long aS they can, but Ryan iS--

- Ryan's dead.
- Oh.

How iS She handling thiS?

38:56.501 --> 38:58.037
She's gonna need
a few minutes.

39:09.180 --> 39:10.966
It'S me.

39:11.140 --> 39:14.348
I know you're not alone right now,
but I really need to talk.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.932
I'm supposed to let it go,
but I can't.

39:18.481 --> 39:22.394
They don't get to win.
Not like this.

39:26.990 --> 39:29.732
Nikita: When we came here,
I thought it was ﬁnally over.

39:29.909 --> 39:32.571
No more running and hiding
and lying.

39:32.787 --> 39:35.574
I really believed that the truth
was going to free us,

39:35.748 --> 39:38.205
but now I'm trapped
in an even bigger lie.

39:40.253 --> 39:42.869
The world doesn't know
that Amanda is alive,

39:43.047 --> 39:46.539
but I do, because Ryan
believed in the truth.

39:46.968 --> 39:48.549
He died for the truth,

39:48.720 --> 39:50.961
and I can 't let that be
for nothing.

39:56.561 --> 39:59.348
Going after her means breaking
some promises I made,

39:59.522 --> 40:01.854
but I don 't see any other way.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.767
I can 't trust the system,
not with this.

40:05.945 --> 40:09.688
lt's failed me, all of us,
too many times.

40:17.707 --> 40:20.619
Jones and his cronies,
they need to pay.

40:20.793 --> 40:23.125
I want them to die
with the whole world watching,

40:23.296 --> 40:25.378
so everyone knows
who they really are

40:25.548 --> 40:26.924
and what they've done.

40:32.138 --> 40:35.471
Taking them on....
I can 't do it alone.

40:39.270 --> 40:42.137

but I need you.

Hey.

40:47.946 --> 40:50.358
I need your help,
one last time.

40:50.573 --> 40:52.188

41:06.756 --> 41:08.792
We started this ﬁght together,

41:09.050 --> 41:11.086
just you and me.

41:12.303 --> 41:13.543
A lot has happened since then,

41:13.721 --> 41:16.303
but I know that this is how
it's supposed to end.

41:18.393 --> 41:20.384
It's time to ﬁnish what we started.
