WEBVTT

00:00.603 --> 00:04.016
We all have our moments
when we suddenly lose it,

00:04.046 --> 00:06.687
but his was in a whole different league.

00:09.440 --> 00:13.039
He was like a cuckoo,
caught between two families.

00:13.040 --> 00:15.719
You're not responsible for
how he's turning out, Ed.

00:15.720 --> 00:17.479
You think you are, but you're not.

00:17.480 --> 00:20.120
And divorce is hardly a
novelty these days, is it?

00:20.580 --> 00:22.559
But he didn't belong in either of them.

00:22.560 --> 00:24.439
Your mother may be
blind to the guilt trips

00:24.440 --> 00:26.879
and the poor, misunderstood
crap you pull, but I'm not.

00:26.880 --> 00:29.470
What about your dad? Build some bridges.

00:29.471 --> 00:31.999
Maybe even think about moving
into his place for a while.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.719
He might surprise you.

00:33.720 --> 00:36.819
- My stepsister's moved in with us.
- And you like her?

00:36.974 --> 00:39.919
Half-brother, stepbrother... we're
all one family now, aren't we?

00:39.920 --> 00:42.719
It's happening again, Gran.
It's like it takes me over.

00:42.720 --> 00:44.425
You have to control it.

00:44.426 --> 00:48.294
- Your grandfather lost control and...
- And what?

00:54.440 --> 00:56.199
And yet losing control...

00:56.200 --> 00:58.336
still haunted him.

01:59.280 --> 02:01.920
He kept doing that
fight-or-flight thing.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.680
But what if that threat is inside you?

02:07.200 --> 02:09.158
No matter how fast you run...

02:09.160 --> 02:10.880
or where you go...

02:12.080 --> 02:13.680
there's no escape.

02:23.757 --> 02:26.849
Turn on all the taps and make
sure the system's drained.

02:33.797 --> 02:36.960
Jesus. Are you OK?

02:50.436 --> 02:53.122
You don't know where my
errant son is by chance?

02:54.156 --> 02:57.214
Er... he texted. Something
about going to his dad's.

02:59.497 --> 03:02.912
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Who's hungry?

03:11.283 --> 03:13.988
- Do you need a hand, or...
- Sure.

03:14.013 --> 03:17.408
You could just take
those to his room for me.

03:17.826 --> 03:19.338
Sure.

03:23.217 --> 03:25.256
So, how are you settling in?

03:25.360 --> 03:28.101
At college, here...

03:28.361 --> 03:30.538
and all points between?

03:30.814 --> 03:32.414
All good.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.376
Why don't you and I do
something on Saturday?

03:36.401 --> 03:38.641
Your dad can baby-sit.

03:38.970 --> 03:42.383
We could check out a few clothes shops,

03:42.600 --> 03:44.398
maybe get some lunch?

03:44.921 --> 03:47.241
Catch a movie, even.

03:47.625 --> 03:52.328
I've got college stuff to
catch up on this weekend, so...

03:53.072 --> 03:55.632
Yeah, well, some other time.

03:59.795 --> 04:01.434
That went well.

04:10.614 --> 04:12.905
- Yeah?
- Is he home yet?

04:12.906 --> 04:16.723
- I thought he was at yours.
- I'm at the hospital with Beth.

04:17.546 --> 04:20.695
- Everything all right?
- Well...

04:21.127 --> 04:23.507
I'm a surgeon, I work here.

04:25.374 --> 04:28.414
We thought it was labour, it was
a false alarm. Shock, probably.

04:28.439 --> 04:29.481
Shock?

04:29.506 --> 04:33.160
Yeah, something at home.
The damn water tank exploded.

04:33.185 --> 04:34.901
And he was there, Hannah.

04:34.926 --> 04:37.380
And he legged it, just like
he did after the car crash.

04:37.405 --> 04:38.942
What the hell is going on with that boy?

04:38.966 --> 04:42.736
Has he no shred of...
common humanity whatsoever?

05:36.542 --> 05:38.701
Is there a swimming pool at the hotel?

05:38.702 --> 05:40.437
It's not a holiday, Jack,

05:40.462 --> 05:42.621
just a stop-gap until we
get this place fixed up.

05:42.622 --> 05:44.557
- How long?
- Three or four days.

05:44.582 --> 05:46.782
Just pop those in the
car for me, please.

05:49.041 --> 05:52.441
I've sent pictures to the insurers.
That's about all we can do for now.

05:52.466 --> 05:54.066
Are you ready?

05:55.272 --> 05:57.471
Why would it suddenly go like that?

05:57.582 --> 05:59.942
The water tank just
suddenly crack like that?

06:00.881 --> 06:03.521
A fault in the seal? God
knows, I'm not a plumber.

06:04.679 --> 06:07.079
You always say surgery's like plumbing.

06:08.887 --> 06:11.768
It's not just the water tank,
it's like an earthquake hit.

06:13.367 --> 06:16.007
And why would he run away like that?

07:17.527 --> 07:19.098
What's going on?

07:21.727 --> 07:23.480
Come on inside.

07:27.607 --> 07:29.540
Are you OK?

07:33.884 --> 07:35.773
I heard something.

07:40.927 --> 07:42.651
The wind.

07:45.927 --> 07:48.167
We should get one of those apps for him.

07:50.348 --> 07:52.387
The guys at work were talking about it,

07:52.412 --> 07:55.675
a GPS thing that tracks your kid's
movement without them knowing.

07:59.567 --> 08:01.471
What, spy on him?

08:01.801 --> 08:04.464
Better than you lying
awake every night worrying.

08:19.167 --> 08:23.213
So, why do you have all
that stuff on your computer?

08:24.567 --> 08:27.284
All that death and disaster stuff.

08:29.967 --> 08:31.706
I had a snoop.

08:36.327 --> 08:39.494
It reminds me, no matter
how bad my shit gets...

08:40.366 --> 08:41.893
it has to be doable.

08:43.076 --> 08:44.955
How bad does it get?

08:47.425 --> 08:50.764
Sometimes, if I hope for
something, I know it won't happen...

08:51.761 --> 08:53.464
just cos I hoped for it.

09:00.527 --> 09:02.727
You into all that as well?

09:05.247 --> 09:07.726
I once asked an RS teacher
if God created the universe,

09:07.727 --> 09:09.327
then who created God?

09:10.527 --> 09:13.885
And he said, "It's because no-one
created Him that makes Him God."

09:15.967 --> 09:18.322
They've got it all nailed
down in the small print.

09:26.327 --> 09:28.527
When my mum got sick...

09:30.287 --> 09:32.807
and all the pain she was in and...

09:35.927 --> 09:39.563
Dad said it was God's way of testing us.

09:40.407 --> 09:42.567
Testing our faith.

09:45.247 --> 09:47.487
And I failed.

09:51.247 --> 09:53.126
Why keep wearing it?

09:56.140 --> 09:57.993
It was hers.

10:24.087 --> 10:26.902
Wait, wait. No, this isn't
right. This isn't right.

10:26.927 --> 10:29.262
We can't... This isn't right.

10:29.287 --> 10:31.807
We shouldn't be doing this.

10:33.302 --> 10:35.141
This can't happen...

10:35.687 --> 10:37.258
ever.

11:27.262 --> 11:28.360
Are you all ri...

11:28.385 --> 11:30.016
What's happening?

11:31.614 --> 11:34.094
No, no. Don't come in, there's glass.

11:36.211 --> 11:38.142
- Did you do that?
- Leave me to this.

11:40.563 --> 11:42.789
Will you see to the baby, please?

11:50.175 --> 11:51.957
What happened?

11:52.169 --> 11:54.035
I didn't touch it.

11:56.132 --> 11:58.692
- Right.
- I didn't go near it.

11:59.406 --> 12:01.244
I'm gonna clean this up in the morning.

12:01.245 --> 12:03.565
You'd best sleep on the sofa tonight.

12:21.766 --> 12:23.966
Where have you been?

12:35.246 --> 12:38.185
You do know Beth ended up in hospital?

12:38.263 --> 12:40.423
They thought she was having the babies.

12:42.286 --> 12:43.902
False alarm.

12:47.833 --> 12:49.472
How could you do that?

12:49.497 --> 12:52.059
Run off and leave her in that state?

12:54.046 --> 12:56.174
Well, I didn't know, did I?

12:57.126 --> 12:59.323
She was all right when I left.

13:02.406 --> 13:04.729
What is going on with you?

13:05.840 --> 13:07.682
Why can't you tell me?

13:10.820 --> 13:13.090
Don't sweat the small stuff, Mum.

13:14.646 --> 13:16.176
I'm fine.

13:57.286 --> 13:59.725
Right, you lot, it's coming this arvo.

13:59.726 --> 14:01.445
It's only 100cc at the moment,

14:01.446 --> 14:03.285
but once I've got a
bit of paper together,

14:03.286 --> 14:05.445
- I'm gonna ramp that up.
- Yeah, we gotta pimp her up.

14:05.446 --> 14:07.885
Flags, reflectors, tail-fin
exhausts. She'll be cool.

14:07.886 --> 14:09.805
As if my dad will ever go for that.

14:09.806 --> 14:12.562
Why is it cars and motorbikes
are always called she?

14:12.761 --> 14:14.361
Cos we like to ride 'em.

14:15.566 --> 14:17.725
Is he always such a creep?

14:17.726 --> 14:20.246
Only 90% of the time.

14:22.611 --> 14:23.972
Hey.

14:30.373 --> 14:32.075
What's up with you, bro?

14:32.806 --> 14:35.085
I've just got some shit
going on, man, that's all.

14:35.086 --> 14:36.763
Such as?

14:39.766 --> 14:42.406
You know where I am, yeah. Whenever.

14:42.443 --> 14:44.725
Cheers, man. Actually,
Az, can you do me a favour?

14:44.726 --> 14:46.326
Sign me in, please.

14:46.406 --> 14:48.686
Anyone asks, say...
say I'm in the library.

14:49.166 --> 14:51.319
- Where's he going?
- I don't know.

14:51.344 --> 14:53.464
Something's going on with him, though.

14:54.286 --> 14:55.908
Are you OK?

15:23.646 --> 15:25.845
See this? In her room.

15:25.846 --> 15:28.765
She never touched the stuff
before, never went near it.

15:28.790 --> 15:30.749
And you know that for a fact, do you?

15:31.180 --> 15:34.860
What do you really know about
her? And I mean really know?

15:35.310 --> 15:39.117
Who her friends were, what
she thinks, what she feels...

15:39.125 --> 15:40.884
Why are you acting like this?

15:40.885 --> 15:43.265
Because I will not let
you make him a scapegoat.

15:43.290 --> 15:45.126
You know perfectly well
you've been no kind of father

15:45.150 --> 15:46.244
to that girl all these years.

15:46.245 --> 15:48.725
And now you want to make
up for it. Yeah, right.

15:49.125 --> 15:51.525
Well, it's too little, too late.

15:52.205 --> 15:54.605
So much for us being a team.

16:04.165 --> 16:06.644
You mentioned your stepsister yesterday,

16:06.645 --> 16:09.526
about having feelings for her.
Did something happen there?

16:09.654 --> 16:11.620
Nothing's gonna happen.

16:12.721 --> 16:14.424
I told you.

16:17.319 --> 16:22.020
And building those bridges with
your dad that we talked about,

16:22.045 --> 16:23.645
how did that go?

16:24.445 --> 16:27.005
It didn't.

16:28.805 --> 16:31.007
It happened again.

16:32.484 --> 16:34.921
The control thing, I... I lost it and...

16:36.116 --> 16:37.716
And?

16:39.366 --> 16:41.280
I trashed his house.

16:45.325 --> 16:46.924
And what triggered that?

16:46.925 --> 16:48.525
A row.

16:48.975 --> 16:51.655
- With your dad?
- Stepmother.

16:54.605 --> 16:57.626
When you lose control like
that, how does it feel?

16:57.651 --> 17:00.985
I mean, physically. Describe it.

17:04.481 --> 17:09.606
Everything gets, like,
heightened... intense...

17:10.125 --> 17:11.844
sounds and colours...

17:11.845 --> 17:14.067
my hands go ice-cold...

17:14.578 --> 17:18.417
and I can hear my own
heart... throbbing,

17:18.847 --> 17:20.935
pounding deep in here.

17:21.973 --> 17:25.086
And emotionally, what do
you feel when that happens?

17:29.365 --> 17:31.525
Ecstasy.

17:39.761 --> 17:43.282
Sorry, receptionist is off today.

17:43.965 --> 17:45.282
One minute.

17:59.999 --> 18:01.953
Sorry about that.

18:08.147 --> 18:10.404
I want you to take a look at this.

18:10.405 --> 18:13.460
Here, deep inside the brain

18:13.485 --> 18:15.965
is something called the limbic system.

18:16.525 --> 18:19.165
It regulates all of our emotions.

18:19.573 --> 18:22.107
Passion, pleasure...

18:23.005 --> 18:25.645
anger, fear.

18:26.124 --> 18:28.164
But if it gets impaired in some way,

18:28.325 --> 18:32.156
a hormone dysfunction
or injury or whatever,

18:32.245 --> 18:35.844
it ceases to function effectively,
your emotions can get out of whack.

18:36.005 --> 18:39.844
They start to control you
rather than vice versa.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.260
I'd like to send you for some tests.

18:42.589 --> 18:46.797
A blood test, a brain scan, just
to rule anything like that out, OK?

18:46.845 --> 18:49.883
It's a routine precaution, that's all.

18:50.328 --> 18:53.245
Just so we know the best
course of treatment to go for.

18:53.845 --> 18:55.684
I can call your dad,
he can go with you...

18:55.685 --> 18:58.204
You said what happened here
is between us, no-one else.

18:58.205 --> 19:01.086
I stand by that. I just thought
you could use the support.

19:01.402 --> 19:03.340
But what if it's something else?

19:04.731 --> 19:07.405
What if I was born with
it and it can't be treated

19:07.525 --> 19:09.205
and I can never control it?

19:10.952 --> 19:13.019
Why would you think that?

19:17.578 --> 19:20.581
Whatever's going on, we're
going to deal with it, OK?

19:52.685 --> 19:55.004
Go on. In the middle! In the middle!

19:55.005 --> 19:56.605
Jack!

19:57.965 --> 19:59.791
Yes!

20:00.420 --> 20:02.020
That's my boy!

20:29.744 --> 20:31.090
Hey, Azfal.

20:31.115 --> 20:33.830
- So, is this the new scooter.
- Yep.

20:33.925 --> 20:35.525
Coming for a spin?

20:46.965 --> 20:48.564
- Ready?
- OK.

20:48.565 --> 20:50.924
- Keep your legs on there.
- All right. Like this?

20:50.925 --> 20:52.399
- Yeah.
- OK.

20:52.424 --> 20:55.071
- Hold on tight.
- All right.

22:15.314 --> 22:17.954
Looking back, the signs were there...

22:18.674 --> 22:20.393
we just didn't see them.

22:20.675 --> 22:22.697
Or we didn't want to see them.

22:24.034 --> 22:27.690
We were all set on a collision
course but we never saw it coming.

22:27.714 --> 22:30.432
Not for him, for me...

22:31.996 --> 22:34.196
or any of us.

22:36.634 --> 22:38.793
Bless us, Lord, and these thy gifts

22:38.794 --> 22:40.553
that we are about to receive

22:40.554 --> 22:44.193
from thy merciful bounty, through
Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.

22:48.554 --> 22:50.392
Do you want to explain this?

22:53.484 --> 22:55.212
You first.

22:56.194 --> 22:59.449
What, am I not allowed
my own personal space now?

22:59.474 --> 23:01.742
Not if that's what you're
gonna use it for, no.

23:03.070 --> 23:04.913
Where'd you get it?

23:04.914 --> 23:07.937
- Victor.
- I want an answer.

23:08.114 --> 23:09.638
It's mine.

23:10.554 --> 23:13.404
Everybody does it, Dad,
it's not a big deal.

23:13.474 --> 23:16.765
It's illegal. Excuse me,
I call that a big deal.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.279
It's the first step to
hard drugs, to addiction.

23:19.280 --> 23:20.999
Your brain is still developing.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.839
You want to risk doing it
long-term damage, permanent damage?

23:23.840 --> 23:25.845
Someone's been Googling.

23:25.870 --> 23:27.455
I'll say this just once.

23:27.481 --> 23:30.681
So long as you live under my roof
you do not give, sell or provide

23:30.706 --> 23:33.761
my daughter with any
more of this filth, ever.

23:33.841 --> 23:36.601
- Do you understand me?
- Except it's not your roof, is it?

23:37.799 --> 23:40.521
Cos my dad paid off the
mortgage in the divorce.

23:41.643 --> 23:44.601
So technically, it's
his roof, and his house.

23:46.587 --> 23:48.212
You're like...

23:48.542 --> 23:50.118
a lodger here.

23:50.676 --> 23:52.579
Go to your room.

23:56.078 --> 23:57.906
You stay.

24:01.976 --> 24:07.734
There are less confrontational
ways of handling things, Victor.

24:09.955 --> 24:13.682
Yeah, well, we lodgers
are a dumb lot, aren't we?

24:53.961 --> 24:56.281
You didn't need to do that.

24:57.137 --> 24:58.515
No biggie.

24:59.743 --> 25:02.383
Anyway, thanks.

25:31.361 --> 25:32.724
Yeah.

25:33.815 --> 25:36.400
I assume this isn't
a professional visit.

25:36.401 --> 25:38.441
I was hoping to talk about your lad.

25:38.466 --> 25:41.961
Thought it best to do it in person,
but if now's not a good time...

25:45.742 --> 25:50.469
I know teenagers can be rebellious,
volatile and the rest. I know that.

25:50.494 --> 25:53.125
But he... he's...

25:53.925 --> 25:56.894
he's beyond reach. Beyond
mine anyway, and his mother's.

25:56.919 --> 25:58.718
He's out all hours of the night,

25:58.738 --> 26:01.168
and when he is home, it's back-chat
or you can't get a word out...

26:01.192 --> 26:03.817
As you say, par for the
course for teenagers.

26:03.818 --> 26:06.318
The other night he smashed
up his room for no reason.

26:06.836 --> 26:09.236
Is that par for the course, too?

26:11.746 --> 26:13.906
Yep. Two minutes.

26:14.178 --> 26:16.377
My daughter lives with
us now. Did he tell you?

26:16.378 --> 26:19.938
I can't have him doing that stuff
around her, getting her into all that.

26:20.158 --> 26:21.758
The weed.

26:21.926 --> 26:24.046
And God knows whatever else he's into.

26:24.551 --> 26:26.830
I'm the bad guy, aren't I?
I'm the wicked stepfather.

26:26.855 --> 26:29.055
I'm the last person
he's gonna listen to.

26:29.283 --> 26:31.553
Hannah won't... or can't confront him.

26:31.578 --> 26:35.993
It's like, I don't know, she feels
guilty about your marriage ending.

26:36.018 --> 26:38.618
Not that she's anything
to feel guilty about there.

26:38.740 --> 26:42.098
I hardly think the blame game is
particularly fruitful at this point.

26:42.138 --> 26:45.426
Hannah mentioned your late
father, his grandfather.

26:45.551 --> 26:47.137
She said she saw some
photographs of him,

26:47.138 --> 26:49.177
how he and the boy are
dead spit of each other.

26:49.178 --> 26:50.898
Two peas in a pod, she says.

26:51.190 --> 26:55.439
She said something about him
having mental health problems.

26:55.672 --> 26:58.553
Do you think that's what we
could be looking at here, too?

26:59.065 --> 27:00.526
That's quite a leap

27:00.551 --> 27:01.594
I'm just trying to find a way...

27:01.618 --> 27:04.513
There's no empirical
evidence that genetic factors

27:04.538 --> 27:06.578
are the cause of behavioural issues.

27:06.658 --> 27:09.818
It's not only simplistic to go
down that road, it's ill-informed.

27:10.338 --> 27:12.538
You know something's not right with him.

27:12.698 --> 27:15.177
Why else would you be
sending him to that shrink?

27:15.178 --> 27:17.719
Or do you pay him to
listen so you don't have to?

27:18.578 --> 27:21.058
This conversation is over.

27:24.658 --> 27:28.738
I came here in good faith because
I'm running out of road with that boy.

27:29.538 --> 27:31.177
I've got my own family to think of.

27:31.178 --> 27:34.036
They're my priority now
as he should be yours.

28:23.258 --> 28:25.009
Er... stay here.

29:13.018 --> 29:14.897
Are you OK?

29:15.403 --> 29:18.102
She started freaking out in the hotel,

29:18.128 --> 29:19.728
said we had to come back.

29:19.753 --> 29:21.753
She's been at it since we got here.

29:21.778 --> 29:25.248
Did I do right to call you? Only she
was weirding me out with it and...

29:25.273 --> 29:26.953
Yeah, of course, of course.

29:27.431 --> 29:30.214
Go watch TV for a
bit, OK? It's all good.

29:30.378 --> 29:32.042
I'm here now.

29:38.611 --> 29:41.137
Look at it! And they've barely
started on the damn plastering.

29:41.162 --> 29:42.802
It's gonna be weeks at this rate.

29:42.827 --> 29:44.730
They're probably just sitting
on their backsides all day

29:44.754 --> 29:46.274
because no-one's keeping tabs on them.

29:46.938 --> 29:49.778
Well, we could stay at the
hotel and do that, sweetheart.

29:49.898 --> 29:50.058
I could pop by on my way to
work, keep an eye on progress.

29:50.059 --> 29:52.940
I could pop by on my way to
work, keep an eye on progress.

29:53.473 --> 29:56.273
Progress? There's a crack in
the ceiling in the bedroom.

29:56.298 --> 29:57.977
And look at these scratches.

29:57.978 --> 30:00.337
They applied the seal
before they removed them.

30:00.338 --> 30:04.097
The only way is to be here to check on
them before they screw up anything else.

30:04.098 --> 30:05.512
OK.

30:05.778 --> 30:09.978
But stressing out about it isn't gonna
do you or the babies any good, is it?

30:10.338 --> 30:13.805
Come on, let's get you upstairs.
Seriously, Beth, you need to rest.

30:16.047 --> 30:18.572
The plumber said it wasn't the
seal that broke on the water tank.

30:18.596 --> 30:20.968
He said it looked like
the thing just exploded.

30:20.993 --> 30:22.593
Literally exploded.

30:22.618 --> 30:25.258
An act of God, he called it.

30:25.418 --> 30:28.940
What if it wasn't God? What
if it was... something else?

30:30.331 --> 30:31.752
Like what?

30:33.338 --> 30:35.017
It was bad luck, that's all.

30:35.018 --> 30:36.618
It happens.

30:36.698 --> 30:38.764
No-one is immune from it.

30:39.938 --> 30:42.337
Let's get you upstairs,
you need to rest.

30:42.633 --> 30:44.233
It was all so perfect.

30:44.258 --> 30:47.428
If it can happen once, it
can happen again, can't it?

30:47.458 --> 30:50.991
No. Lightning never
strikes twice, does it?

31:00.739 --> 31:03.018
You must be telepathic.

31:03.618 --> 31:06.417
I've only just this minute
been trying to call your father.

31:06.418 --> 31:08.172
Now, not to alarm you, pet,

31:08.391 --> 31:11.149
but your gran's had what's called a TIA,

31:11.664 --> 31:13.264
a mini stroke.

31:20.095 --> 31:21.669
Hey, Gran.

31:27.018 --> 31:28.672
What have you been up to?

31:32.738 --> 31:34.897
You're going to get through this, OK?

31:34.898 --> 31:36.857
That's an order.

31:42.267 --> 31:44.228
Why not close your eyes for a bit?

31:44.658 --> 31:46.572
I'll sit with you.

33:39.711 --> 33:41.336
Hi.

33:45.773 --> 33:49.398
So, is this how it's
going to be with us?

33:50.933 --> 33:52.631
The big freeze?

33:54.405 --> 33:56.765
The thing about Azfal is...

33:58.133 --> 34:00.413
he'll chat up anything in a skirt.

34:01.213 --> 34:03.085
Thanks for the heads up.

34:09.773 --> 34:11.663
Sometimes I do stuff.

34:12.772 --> 34:14.339
Bad stuff.

34:15.813 --> 34:17.268
Like what?

34:17.878 --> 34:19.268
You don't want to know.

34:19.293 --> 34:22.197
I do, as it goes.

34:29.373 --> 34:31.853
Some graffiti near my dad's house.

34:33.413 --> 34:36.053
"The urge to destroy is creative".

34:38.533 --> 34:40.380
Do you believe that?

34:40.757 --> 34:45.036
I might, if I knew what it meant.

34:54.853 --> 34:57.293
This stuff you do...

34:59.308 --> 35:00.802
how bad is it?

35:04.293 --> 35:06.334
You know what I think?

35:08.654 --> 35:10.120
I don't think you have
a bad bone in your body.

35:10.144 --> 35:12.784
- You don't know the half of it.
- So tell me.

35:16.508 --> 35:17.990
If I did...

35:19.454 --> 35:21.251
I'd have to kill you.

35:36.862 --> 35:40.277
You think we can do this
whole brother-and-sister thing?

35:40.597 --> 35:42.292
We have to.

35:42.723 --> 35:44.730
Easier said than done.

35:47.293 --> 35:49.693
I didn't say it was easy.

35:56.152 --> 35:58.270
Maybe I can make it easy.

36:16.413 --> 36:19.510
- Come in, Mr Jarrett.
- Thank you.

36:58.782 --> 37:01.102
My boys.

37:12.893 --> 37:15.533
He forgot his packed lunch again.

37:16.525 --> 37:17.932
See you in a bit.

37:17.933 --> 37:20.696
He's not in a very good
place at the moment, Faith.

37:20.773 --> 37:25.017
He really doesn't need any
more... complications in his life.

37:27.013 --> 37:29.714
However we got here,
we're a family now, but...

37:30.893 --> 37:33.173
we're hanging on by a thread.

37:36.347 --> 37:39.267
We used to come here
every weekend, you and I.

37:39.292 --> 37:40.892
Do you remember?

37:42.653 --> 37:45.839
It was that roundabout,
you used to love it.

37:52.413 --> 37:54.292
- All right, ready?
- Yeah, go.

38:11.733 --> 38:14.053
So, you're seeing the shrink again?

38:15.893 --> 38:17.866
Is it helping?

38:20.133 --> 38:22.333
She'll be all right, won't she?

38:23.118 --> 38:24.774
Gran.

38:25.133 --> 38:27.571
She's a lot tougher than people think.

38:36.093 --> 38:37.972
Where'd you get this?

38:37.973 --> 38:39.572
What made him do it?

38:43.573 --> 38:48.031
"The balance of his mind was
disturbed," to quote the coroner.

38:49.101 --> 38:52.628
His note said something
about by ending his life,

38:52.653 --> 38:55.065
he might save the lives of others.

38:59.813 --> 39:01.772
He suffered from delusions.

39:01.773 --> 39:06.264
He was obsessed with the idea
that he had psychic powers,

39:06.318 --> 39:10.397
that he could move objects
through thought control.

39:10.748 --> 39:12.428
Not that it made him happy.

39:13.214 --> 39:16.303
If anything, he was tortured by it.

39:18.773 --> 39:21.413
That's why I became a surgeon.

39:22.653 --> 39:25.293
The safe harbour of logic...

39:26.173 --> 39:27.811
reason.

39:28.425 --> 39:31.013
The science of deduction.

39:34.053 --> 39:36.412
Then again, maybe we all
rebel against our fathers

39:36.413 --> 39:38.493
when we discover they're not perfect.

39:46.642 --> 39:48.393
I was thinking...

39:49.893 --> 39:52.533
maybe I could come
live with you for a bit.

39:53.608 --> 39:55.030
Because of Victor?

39:55.179 --> 39:59.046
No, it's just... things are
kind of heavy at home right now.

40:00.333 --> 40:02.370
I would like nothing more.

40:03.566 --> 40:06.006
You have no idea.

40:08.773 --> 40:11.668
Beth is very fragile at the moment

40:11.693 --> 40:13.892
since that damn business
with the water tank.

40:13.893 --> 40:16.040
And you legging it away
like that didn't help.

40:16.065 --> 40:18.853
I'll try harder with her. I will.

40:22.893 --> 40:26.520
She just... she can't deal with...

40:27.293 --> 40:30.036
chaos, uncertainty.

40:30.213 --> 40:34.520
If she's not in control she...
she finds it threatening.

40:37.596 --> 40:40.012
When the babies come,
when we're in a routine,

40:40.013 --> 40:42.733
when she's more settled,
I'll broach it with her then.

40:43.558 --> 40:45.158
A couple of months, max.

40:46.783 --> 40:49.263
You can hang on that long, can't you?

40:51.673 --> 40:53.264
No worries.

40:57.573 --> 40:59.310
Late for clinic.

41:00.653 --> 41:03.802
Dinner next week? Yeah? I'll text you.

41:19.133 --> 41:21.092
It was just a white lie.

41:21.093 --> 41:24.448
Just one stupid white lie.

41:24.630 --> 41:26.390
I only did it to protect him.

41:26.603 --> 41:29.995
Instead, I pushed him into the abyss.

41:36.241 --> 41:38.612
- Hey.
- Where are you?

41:38.613 --> 41:41.851
I'm at the library
finishing an assignment.

41:42.203 --> 41:44.803
Look, whatever's getting
on between us, we need to,

41:44.828 --> 41:46.569
you know, deal with it.

41:46.968 --> 41:48.568
One way or the other.

41:48.593 --> 41:50.573
Can we talk about this later?

41:50.813 --> 41:52.057
OK.

41:53.653 --> 41:56.053
So I'm your assignment now, am I?

42:15.813 --> 42:18.053
I don't know how you...

42:21.293 --> 42:23.933
All right, I'm off. See you later?

42:24.293 --> 42:26.733
Yeah, yeah.

42:54.229 --> 42:55.954
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

42:56.205 --> 42:57.915
Oh, my God!

43:06.628 --> 43:08.502
Azfal! Azfal!

43:08.527 --> 43:10.048
I'm a nurse.

43:45.470 --> 43:47.443
I came as soon as I could.

43:55.293 --> 43:56.932
I can't make it stop.

43:56.933 --> 43:58.812
It just keeps coming,
it keeps happening.

43:58.813 --> 44:00.493
What? What keeps happening?

44:00.653 --> 44:03.492
- I did a wrong thing, a bad thing.
- All right, take a breath, OK?

44:03.563 --> 44:05.163
Calm down.

44:05.233 --> 44:07.973
- What kind of bad thing?
- I didn't mean to, I didn't mean it.

44:07.998 --> 44:10.453
Hey, stop that. Enough. Stop.

44:11.613 --> 44:13.192
Just tell me what you did.

44:13.217 --> 44:14.754
I can't help you if you don't tell...

44:14.779 --> 44:17.133
I didn't want this.
I never asked for it.

44:17.213 --> 44:20.148
I got it from him, my
grandfather. He had it, too.

44:20.173 --> 44:21.773
He could do it, too.

44:22.306 --> 44:23.906
Move things with this.

44:26.013 --> 44:27.800
You don't believe me?

44:28.293 --> 44:30.782
- You want proof? I can give you proof.
- You don't have to prove anything to me.

44:30.806 --> 44:33.213
I need you to believe me.

44:33.773 --> 44:36.292
Don't you get it? I can't
be alone with it any more.

44:36.293 --> 44:37.893
All right, fine.

44:39.210 --> 44:40.740
Prove it.

45:38.414 --> 45:39.945
Now do you believe me?

45:41.312 --> 45:45.118
