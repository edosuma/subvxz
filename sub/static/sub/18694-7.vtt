00:00.001 --> 00:01.464
<i>Previously on</i> Bones...

00:01.468 --> 00:02.690
<i>That's Aldo Clemens.</i>

00:02.691 --> 00:04.657
- Who's Aldo Clemens?
- He was the chaplain

00:04.693 --> 00:06.107
of Booth's army unit.

00:06.131 --> 00:07.892
Anytime
I needed anything,

00:07.893 --> 00:09.192
Aldo was always there for me.

00:09.228 --> 00:10.878
I'm sure that goes
for the other men

00:10.879 --> 00:12.145
<i>in your unit, too.</i>

00:12.180 --> 00:13.446
-Sergeant.
 -Hey, Mike.

00:13.481 --> 00:14.859
I wish it was
for a different occasion.

00:14.883 --> 00:16.883
- Me too.
- Who killed him, Seeley?

00:16.918 --> 00:18.295
I don't know, Dave,
but I'm gonna find out.

00:18.319 --> 00:20.720
<i>Aldo Clemens was tortured</i>

00:20.755 --> 00:21.966
<i>for an extended period of time.</i>

00:21.990 --> 00:23.456
<i>He was fastened to the table</i>

00:23.491 --> 00:26.192
by duct tape,
but he managed to loosen it.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.394
<i>He could raise</i>
<i>his upper torso...</i>

00:28.429 --> 00:30.396
And sever his spinal cord.

00:30.431 --> 00:31.564
It was a sacrifice.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.432
<i>You know</i>
<i>that X-ray that we saw?</i>

00:33.468 --> 00:34.545
I'm the one who made that shot.

00:34.569 --> 00:35.701
Bosnia, 1995.

00:35.737 --> 00:37.370
The warlord?

00:37.405 --> 00:38.871
Aldo knew
that I was the shooter.

00:38.907 --> 00:40.239
He killed himself

00:40.275 --> 00:42.742
so he wouldn't
have to give me up.

00:42.777 --> 00:44.010
This is about revenge.

00:44.045 --> 00:45.144
What should we do?

00:45.180 --> 00:46.612
Just be ready.

00:51.853 --> 00:52.952
Help!

00:52.987 --> 00:54.987
He's still after me!

00:55.990 --> 00:58.257
He's still after me!

00:58.293 --> 01:00.126
No, no, no! Help!

01:02.330 --> 01:03.563
He's still coming!

01:05.433 --> 01:06.632
Darla?

01:11.406 --> 01:14.473
Talk to me.
What is it this time?

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:28.423 --> 01:31.424
Darla, are you all right?

01:31.459 --> 01:33.359
All right, calm down.

01:33.394 --> 01:35.795
It's never as bad
as you think it is.

01:37.498 --> 01:39.131
<i>So your dad stepped out</i>

01:39.167 --> 01:41.000
to take a private call.
What's the big deal?

01:41.035 --> 01:42.335
It's not only that, Booth.

01:42.370 --> 01:44.971
He looks different to me.

01:45.006 --> 01:46.706
Healthier.
That's good.

01:46.741 --> 01:47.851
Maybe he's changing his ways.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.275
No. At his age?

01:49.310 --> 01:50.776
I do not believe that.

01:50.812 --> 01:53.980
Come on, people can change
later in life, Bones.

01:54.015 --> 01:56.882
Actually, neurological studies
show how difficult it is

01:56.918 --> 01:59.485
for an elderly
person to alter

01:59.520 --> 02:00.886
their basal ganglia.

02:00.922 --> 02:02.989
Basal... gangamaly?
What are you talking about?

02:03.024 --> 02:06.125
It's a part of the forebrain
that is responsible

02:06.160 --> 02:08.693
for routine behavior
and deeply ingrained habits.

02:10.965 --> 02:11.998
Good morning, everyone.

02:12.033 --> 02:13.132
The, uh,

02:13.167 --> 02:14.367
kiddos ready for drop-off?

02:14.402 --> 02:15.501
They are.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.169
Everything all right, Dad?

02:17.205 --> 02:18.371
Absolutely.

02:18.406 --> 02:19.505
Why wouldn't it be?

02:19.540 --> 02:21.274
Well, you never go
outside to take a call,

02:21.309 --> 02:22.553
so why the sudden need
for privacy?

02:22.577 --> 02:24.610
Oh, I was just catching up
with an old friend.

02:24.646 --> 02:26.746
At 8:00 in the morning?

02:26.781 --> 02:28.014
- Whoa! -00 a.m.

02:28.049 --> 02:29.982
I... really. It's that late?

02:30.018 --> 02:32.518
I should help the kiddos,
you know, tie their shoes.

02:32.553 --> 02:34.520
I-I'll help, too.
No! Good luck with that.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.155
Dad.

02:36.190 --> 02:38.024
We need to talk.

02:38.059 --> 02:42.795
Well, I guess I'm not going
anywhere until we do, am I?

02:42.830 --> 02:44.997
What's going on?

02:45.033 --> 02:46.399
What do you mean, Tempe?

02:46.434 --> 02:48.167
You know what I mean.

02:48.202 --> 02:50.936
Your skin
has a healthy pinkish flush.

02:50.972 --> 02:53.739
And for the last few weeks
you haven't once wheezed

02:53.775 --> 02:55.441
while playing on the floor
with the kids.

02:55.476 --> 02:58.077
Well, thank you. I think.

02:58.112 --> 03:00.179
What's wrong with feeling great?
Nothing.

03:00.214 --> 03:02.848
As long as you can provide me
with a causal explanation.

03:02.884 --> 03:04.895
Well, I have a right to keep
certain things to myself.

03:04.919 --> 03:06.719
Not when it comes
to your health.

03:06.754 --> 03:09.322
Okay, okay.
A few months ago,

03:09.357 --> 03:12.992
I had some issues, and I went
to a cardiologist about it.

03:13.027 --> 03:15.328
When were you planning
on telling me this?

03:15.363 --> 03:17.129
I-I couldn't find the time--
you're so busy--

03:17.165 --> 03:19.932
so I just went ahead and I went
in and I had it put in my chest,

03:19.967 --> 03:21.233
and I feel...
Excuse me.

03:21.269 --> 03:22.868
I was...
You-you had a pacemaker

03:22.904 --> 03:24.737
embedded in your chest
without telling us?

03:24.772 --> 03:25.883
Yeah. And I feel great, too.

03:25.907 --> 03:27.273
Dad!

03:27.308 --> 03:28.741
Now I've upset you.

03:28.776 --> 03:29.975
Yes! Of course I'm upset.

03:30.011 --> 03:31.221
You had a significant procedure

03:31.245 --> 03:32.411
done without telling me.

03:34.682 --> 03:35.848
Hold on.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.616
A body was found.

03:37.652 --> 03:38.951
They're bringing it to the lab.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.886
Don't-don't be angry with me.

03:40.922 --> 03:42.121
You-you have
to understand.

03:42.156 --> 03:45.458
We'll talk about this later.

03:50.465 --> 03:53.265
A jogger found the body
in Fountainhead Regional Park.

03:53.301 --> 03:55.179
I'll have Aubrey look into
any missing person reports

03:55.203 --> 03:56.669
in the area.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.148
It looks like
it's been there for a while,

03:58.172 --> 04:00.406
judging from the decomposition

04:00.441 --> 04:02.141
and the animal predation.

04:02.176 --> 04:04.043
You know, I've been
thinking about your dad.

04:04.078 --> 04:05.811
Maybe you should
give him a break.

04:05.847 --> 04:07.680
Wha--? A break?

04:07.715 --> 04:10.216
Absolutely not.
He lied to me.

04:10.251 --> 04:12.351
I'm an FBI agent.
That was not a lie.

04:12.387 --> 04:13.986
He lied by omission.

04:14.021 --> 04:17.555
Why would you hide
a significant medical issue

04:17.591 --> 04:19.225
from your own daughter?

04:19.260 --> 04:20.637
Well, 'cause he didn't
want to worry you.

04:20.661 --> 04:21.927
Well, I want to be worried.

04:21.963 --> 04:23.462
What, you want to-- Why?

04:23.498 --> 04:25.008
Because I want
to be involved in his life.

04:25.032 --> 04:26.999
At his age, I only have
so much time with him.

04:27.034 --> 04:29.435
I don't want to be in the dark
about what he's going through.

04:29.470 --> 04:32.972
Well, you know. He's lucky
to have a daughter like you.

04:33.007 --> 04:34.618
Well, he'll be a little less
lucky if he continues

04:34.642 --> 04:36.942
to withhold information
about his health.

04:39.714 --> 04:41.647
The obtuse angle
of the mandible

04:41.682 --> 04:43.949
indicates the
victim was female.

04:43.985 --> 04:47.353
And the texture of
the hair suggests Asian descent.

04:47.388 --> 04:50.923
Rounded eminence of the maxilla
supports that.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.758
The length of the femur
indicates

04:52.794 --> 04:55.327
her height was approximately
five feet, three inches.

04:55.363 --> 04:56.896
X-rays show osteophytic lipping

04:56.931 --> 04:59.732
on the thoracic vertebrae,
which indicates

04:59.767 --> 05:02.802
the victim was probably
in her mid-70s.

05:02.837 --> 05:06.939
There's also evidence of
osteoarthritic degeneration

05:06.974 --> 05:08.974
on the humeral heads
of the shoulders.

05:09.010 --> 05:10.554
It must have been painful
for her to move.

05:10.578 --> 05:11.677
Based on
the blowfly larvae,

05:11.712 --> 05:13.446
she's been dead about a week.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.581
Hey. What do we have here?

05:15.616 --> 05:17.016
More hair?

05:17.051 --> 05:19.618
Well, it looks like canine hair.
I'm gonna examine

05:19.654 --> 05:22.688
the medulla structures. See
if I can narrow down the breed.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.657
What did you find?

05:24.692 --> 05:27.426
When the jogger fell
on the body,

05:27.462 --> 05:29.695
the impact must have
lodged this object

05:29.730 --> 05:34.033
in the infraglenoid tubercle
of the scapula.

05:34.068 --> 05:36.068
Can I see that?

05:38.272 --> 05:39.905
It looks like jewelry.

05:42.043 --> 05:46.011
Oh. I might be able
to locate a make and vendor.

05:46.047 --> 05:47.613
Oh. No need.

05:47.648 --> 05:50.916
It's a limited edition
Enchanted Hummingbird Brooch.

05:53.588 --> 05:55.688
O-Okay. How did you know that?

05:57.825 --> 06:00.059
You can get it from HSM.

06:01.796 --> 06:03.996
Histological Stenotic
Microanalysis?

06:04.031 --> 06:07.533
More likely the Home Super Mall.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.168
O-Okay. Hold on
a second, now.

06:09.203 --> 06:12.137
Our cosmopolitan,
stylish Cam Saroyan

06:12.173 --> 06:15.107
watches the Home Super Mall?

06:15.142 --> 06:16.575
Well, I-I may have caught

06:16.611 --> 06:18.410
bits and pieces
while I was channel surfing.

06:18.446 --> 06:22.081
I can barely get her
away from HSM whenever it's on.

06:22.116 --> 06:23.916
Oh!

06:23.951 --> 06:25.696
No, no, no. Hey. Where
are you going? No. Come on, Cam.

06:25.720 --> 06:27.753
I have so many more questions
for you now.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.555
I'm sure there
are more pressing things

06:29.590 --> 06:30.923
to attend to, Dr. Hodgins,

06:30.958 --> 06:33.826
and we will discuss this later,
Dr. Vaziri.

06:37.865 --> 06:39.899
"Dr. Vaziri."

06:41.102 --> 06:42.601
I think you're in trouble.

into the sales records

07:21.242 --> 07:22.405
at the Home Super Mall.

07:22.406 --> 07:25.941
2,108 people across the country
bought this limited edition

07:25.942 --> 07:27.908
Enchanted Hummingbird Brooch.

07:27.944 --> 07:29.285
Any in the D.C. area?

07:29.286 --> 07:30.485
83 individuals.

07:30.520 --> 07:32.253
Okay. How many were elderly?

07:32.289 --> 07:34.122
My guess would be all of them.

07:34.157 --> 07:35.390
See that thing?

07:35.425 --> 07:36.891
Right.
And Angela said

07:36.927 --> 07:39.060
that this woman matched
a reconstruction.

07:39.095 --> 07:41.396
Margaret Kwan
of Rockville, Maryland.

07:41.431 --> 07:44.766
Looks like we have
our victim, yeah?

07:44.801 --> 07:47.502
The X-rays show pronounced
bone loss on both femurs.

07:47.537 --> 07:49.838
Almost certainly due
to Vitamin D deficiency.

07:49.873 --> 07:53.074
Chances are, she didn't
get much sunlight.

07:55.512 --> 07:57.312
And what are you finding?

07:57.347 --> 07:59.047
That you think it's appropriate

07:59.082 --> 08:02.016
to share personal details
about me with everyone here.

08:02.052 --> 08:04.819
You have nothing to be ashamed
of. You like to shop on TV.

08:04.855 --> 08:06.955
And you enjoyed
telling everyone about it.

08:06.990 --> 08:08.223
Okay. A little.

08:08.258 --> 08:09.791
Only because
you're so professional.

08:09.826 --> 08:11.359
I mean, if you weren't,

08:11.394 --> 08:12.627
I would kiss you right now.

08:12.662 --> 08:15.163
I might even grab your butt.

08:15.198 --> 08:16.497
Don't you dare.

08:16.533 --> 08:18.299
Okay, fine. I'll try not to.

08:18.335 --> 08:20.034
But the struggle is real.

08:20.070 --> 08:22.070
Well, I am flattered,
and appalled

08:22.105 --> 08:24.105
by your lack of professionalism.

08:24.140 --> 08:27.809
Now, I'm finding adhesive
capsulitis and tendinitis

08:27.844 --> 08:30.178
on the victim's
capsular ligament.

08:30.213 --> 08:31.958
So the victim had
a repetitive stress injury?

08:31.982 --> 08:34.048
Yeah, but only on
the right shoulder.

08:37.921 --> 08:39.888
There's also bone spurs
on the right hand.

08:39.923 --> 08:41.456
Do you think
they're related?

08:41.491 --> 08:43.390
Well, it's just
on one side of the body.

08:43.426 --> 08:45.827
Maybe caused by an
activity or a hobby

08:45.862 --> 08:47.061
that favors one arm.

08:47.097 --> 08:49.631
Something repetitive
and detail-oriented.

08:49.666 --> 08:51.399
Knitting?

08:51.434 --> 08:52.800
Oh! That would do it.

08:52.836 --> 08:53.880
So, an old shut-in who spent

08:53.904 --> 08:55.270
most of her time knitting.

08:55.305 --> 08:57.505
Who would want to kill
such a woman?

08:59.509 --> 09:01.576
So how long did
Margaret live here?

09:01.611 --> 09:03.044
And what's with all
the boxes?

09:03.079 --> 09:04.212
Beats me.

09:04.247 --> 09:05.324
Don't you manage the building?

09:05.348 --> 09:07.115
Yeah, only because
my dad makes me.

09:07.150 --> 09:09.617
I'm so out of here as soon
as I find something better.

09:09.653 --> 09:12.120
Attitude like that,
you're gonna go far.

09:12.155 --> 09:13.733
That's funny.
My dad said the same thing.

09:13.757 --> 09:15.690
Right. So, any idea

09:15.725 --> 09:17.959
who might've wanted
to hurt Margaret?

09:17.994 --> 09:20.128
No. She kept to herself.
Barely ever left.

09:20.163 --> 09:22.397
Any friends or family
come and visit?

09:22.432 --> 09:23.976
That would mean I would
have had to let them in.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.099
I'll take that as a no.

09:25.135 --> 09:26.601
Wow. Looks like Margaret

09:26.636 --> 09:28.269
was preparing
for the apocalypse.

09:28.305 --> 09:29.782
She got everything
delivered here, huh?

09:29.806 --> 09:31.806
So, no photos
of family or friends.

09:31.841 --> 09:33.074
No visitors.

09:33.109 --> 09:34.943
It looks like
no one cared about her.

09:36.980 --> 09:39.547
I'm finding antemortem
comminuted fractures

09:39.582 --> 09:42.283
on the phalanges
and metatarsals of the feet.

09:42.319 --> 09:44.552
These are impact fractures.

09:44.587 --> 09:47.121
Note the radiating pattern.

09:47.157 --> 09:51.392
They appear to have been caused
by a heavy cylindrical object.

09:51.428 --> 09:52.560
A hammer?

09:52.595 --> 09:54.562
That would match
the force profile.

09:54.597 --> 09:55.897
I can see that the fractures

09:55.932 --> 09:58.166
were made by multiple blows,
inflicted

09:58.201 --> 09:59.567
over an extended period of time.

09:59.602 --> 10:02.170
Which suggests this
woman was tortured.

10:02.205 --> 10:05.773
The amount
of remodeling indicates

10:05.809 --> 10:08.209
the damage occurred
a week prior to death.

10:09.112 --> 10:10.912
I was examining tissue

10:10.947 --> 10:13.247
from the victim's
wrists and ankles

10:13.283 --> 10:16.284
and found ligature marks.

10:16.319 --> 10:18.886
They're
at least two inches wide.

10:18.922 --> 10:21.255
So she was strapped down
before she was tortured?

10:21.291 --> 10:24.525
Torture is usually is an attempt
to extract information.

10:24.561 --> 10:27.295
What information
could Margaret possibly have?

10:30.767 --> 10:33.701
I've been looking
into Margaret Kwan's records,

10:33.737 --> 10:36.604
and looks like her life
was pretty quiet.

10:36.639 --> 10:38.539
No husband, no children.

10:38.575 --> 10:40.908
No contact
with the outside world.

10:40.944 --> 10:43.244
Everything points
to her being a hermit.

10:43.279 --> 10:44.812
Well, the killer
targeted Margaret.

10:44.848 --> 10:46.547
There's got to be something.

10:46.583 --> 10:48.082
I'm sure that's true,
I just,

10:48.118 --> 10:50.385
I can't find links
between her and anyone.

10:50.420 --> 10:51.919
She barely used her cell phone.

10:51.955 --> 10:56.057
Parking security cameras
show that her car sat

10:56.092 --> 10:57.892
for three and four weeks
at a time.

10:57.927 --> 10:59.505
That's consistent
with what we found.

10:59.529 --> 11:01.329
She even ordered
her food online.

11:01.364 --> 11:02.697
Apartment was filled with boxes.

11:02.732 --> 11:05.033
That's it-- boxes.

11:05.068 --> 11:06.467
I mean, look.

11:06.503 --> 11:07.902
Someone delivered those boxes.

11:07.937 --> 11:10.471
Whoever it was...
may have seen something.

11:10.507 --> 11:12.340
Most of the deliveries came

11:12.375 --> 11:14.308
through National Parcel.

11:14.344 --> 11:16.644
Those drivers have routes.
Can you get a name?

11:16.679 --> 11:19.480
Yeah. Uh, her shipping
receipts show

11:19.516 --> 11:22.550
that the packages were
delivered by one employee.

11:22.585 --> 11:23.751
Michael Reiss.

11:23.787 --> 11:25.553
Wait a second,
Michael L. Reiss?

11:26.523 --> 11:28.890
Yeah. How did you know?

11:28.925 --> 11:30.691
He served with me
in my Ranger unit.

11:30.727 --> 11:32.393
I just saw him
at Aldo's funeral.

11:32.429 --> 11:34.195
Wait, another guy in your unit?

11:34.230 --> 11:35.797
We got to find Mike.

11:35.832 --> 11:38.599
Uh, according
to his work records,

11:38.635 --> 11:41.235
he hasn't been there
for a few weeks.

11:41.271 --> 11:42.370
What about cell records?

11:42.405 --> 11:44.806
That stopped about a week ago,

11:44.841 --> 11:50.178
and no ATM withdrawals
or credit card use, either.

11:53.233 --> 11:55.044
Are we certain that Margaret
and Aldo were killed

11:55.068 --> 11:56.100
by the same person?

11:56.136 --> 11:57.336
We are not certain of anything

11:57.370 --> 11:58.469
until we can prove it.

11:58.505 --> 11:59.670
Now, Aldo Clemens

11:59.706 --> 12:02.774
was restrained
with duct tape.

12:02.809 --> 12:05.176
Let's compare the width
of the ligature marks I found

12:05.211 --> 12:07.311
on Margaret Kwan with Aldo's.

12:08.882 --> 12:10.448
They seem to match.

12:10.483 --> 12:13.050
But both of them were
tortured in different ways.

12:13.086 --> 12:14.485
That is
correct.

12:14.521 --> 12:17.255
However, the modus operandi
are identical.

12:17.290 --> 12:22.460
In each case, the torture
was extensive and prolonged.

12:22.495 --> 12:23.806
Well, fortunately,
there aren't that many

12:23.830 --> 12:25.541
people out there with
an aptitude or a taste

12:25.565 --> 12:26.842
for inflicting
this amount of pain.

12:26.866 --> 12:27.832
Finally got a breed

12:27.867 --> 12:29.100
for those
dog hairs I found

12:29.135 --> 12:31.936
on Margaret Kwan's blouse:
border collie.

12:31.971 --> 12:33.816
Well, Booth said there was no
evidence that she owned a pet.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.339
It might have come
from the killer.

12:35.375 --> 12:37.508
How is Booth, by the way?

12:37.544 --> 12:40.745
He is deeply concerned.
Aldo's death was a blow to him,

12:40.780 --> 12:43.848
and now Mike Reiss appears
to be in danger.

12:43.883 --> 12:47.885
There's a chip between the first
and second mandibular molars.

12:47.921 --> 12:49.787
It appears to be perimortem.

12:49.823 --> 12:53.024
Presumably caused by the victim
biting intensely

12:53.059 --> 12:56.194
during her torture.

12:56.229 --> 12:58.129
Oh, there's a faint blue stain.

12:58.164 --> 12:59.964
Something came into contact
with the teeth

12:59.999 --> 13:01.110
long enough to leave residue.

13:01.134 --> 13:02.834
I'll swab.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.302
See if it leads us somewhere.

13:04.337 --> 13:07.405
Wait... there's damage
on the mandible.

13:12.945 --> 13:15.512
General Josip Radik.

13:15.548 --> 13:17.648
I do not like the way
he's looking at me.

13:17.683 --> 13:20.317
He was a war criminal.
Guilty of ethnic cleansing.

13:20.353 --> 13:22.019
That pretty much confirms it.

13:22.054 --> 13:23.598
Look, my unit was the one
who killed him in the '90s.

13:23.622 --> 13:25.055
I was the one who took the shot.

13:25.091 --> 13:26.724
Too many links to you, Seeley,

13:26.759 --> 13:28.492
for this to not be
about revenge.

13:28.527 --> 13:30.527
The killer tried to get
Booth's name out of Aldo.

13:30.563 --> 13:32.329
Aldo wouldn't give it up.

13:32.365 --> 13:33.809
I still don't understand
what this has to do

13:33.833 --> 13:34.898
with Margaret Kwan.

13:34.934 --> 13:36.400
Mike was a Ranger,
just like Aldo,

13:36.435 --> 13:38.869
so the killer knew that
torture wouldn't work.

13:38.904 --> 13:43.040
Are you telling me this monster
tortured an innocent old lady

13:43.075 --> 13:45.175
in order to get Mike Reiss
to give up your name?

13:45.211 --> 13:47.378
That's the way Mike was.
He was a good guy.

13:47.413 --> 13:48.690
That was the killer's best shot.

13:48.714 --> 13:50.581
I'm not taking any chances,
<i>Cher.</i>

13:50.616 --> 13:51.915
I'm putting you and your family

13:51.951 --> 13:54.184
into the highest level
of safe house.

13:54.220 --> 13:55.686
Even I won't know
where to find you.

13:55.721 --> 13:57.199
Make sure that Max
and the kids get there,

13:57.223 --> 13:58.533
'cause I'm not giving up
on this case.

13:58.557 --> 14:00.224
Why did I know
you would say that?

14:00.259 --> 14:01.625
Booth.

14:01.660 --> 14:03.127
We know how Margaret Kwan died.

14:03.162 --> 14:05.129
We found corresponding nicks

14:05.164 --> 14:06.575
on the gonial angles
of the mandible.

14:06.599 --> 14:08.031
The killer slit her throat.

14:08.067 --> 14:10.045
He would only do that if
he was finished torturing her.

14:10.069 --> 14:13.003
Which means he got
what he needed.

14:13.038 --> 14:14.905
We have to assume he knows
who you are, Booth.

14:14.940 --> 14:16.473
Then I'll have
to get to him first.

14:17.710 --> 14:19.276
I think that I found something.

14:19.311 --> 14:22.413
You know that weird blue stain
on the victim's molars?

14:22.448 --> 14:24.982
Hodgins says
that it's calcium,

14:25.017 --> 14:28.252
aloxite, silica,
and cobalt chloride.

14:28.287 --> 14:29.553
Chalk?

14:29.588 --> 14:31.155
Well, it's a
high-end billiard chalk

14:31.190 --> 14:33.090
called Blue Lightning.

14:33.125 --> 14:35.826
Well, Margaret Kwan was a
shut-in, not a pool shark.

14:35.861 --> 14:37.461
It must have been
from the killer.

14:37.496 --> 14:40.164
Well, I've been running a search
for bars and pool halls

14:40.199 --> 14:43.534
within the D.C. area
that use this Blue Lightning.

14:43.569 --> 14:46.904
I've found 37, so far.

14:46.939 --> 14:49.251
Now, Hodgins said the killer
had border collie hair on him.

14:49.275 --> 14:50.541
Can you help us with that?

14:50.576 --> 14:52.910
Yeah, I can run a search
for dog licenses.

14:55.781 --> 14:58.882
There was a license filed
for a border collie

14:58.918 --> 15:01.585
by a Javor Nicovic.

15:01.620 --> 15:03.620
And the address
is Eastland Bar.

15:03.656 --> 15:06.690
One of the locations that uses
Blue Lightning chalk.

15:09.094 --> 15:10.828
Nicovic emigrated

15:10.863 --> 15:12.963
from Serbia 20 years ago.

15:12.998 --> 15:14.198
I'll tell Booth.

15:21.540 --> 15:23.640
Give me high five,
to the side,

15:23.676 --> 15:25.042
the other side,
down low-- ooh!

15:25.077 --> 15:28.078
Too slow.
I don't understand!

15:28.113 --> 15:30.058
If there's somebody out there
that is a threat to Booth,

15:30.082 --> 15:31.648
please let me help.

15:31.684 --> 15:33.217
It's more than a threat, Dad.

15:33.252 --> 15:36.286
This is revenge for something
Booth did years ago,

15:36.322 --> 15:38.555
and Booth says that
they won't be satisfied

15:38.591 --> 15:40.090
until they kill him.

15:40.125 --> 15:43.260
I have experience with this,
Temperance. You need me.

15:43.295 --> 15:45.496
I need to help Booth,
and I-I can't do that

15:45.531 --> 15:47.498
until I know
my children are safe.

15:47.533 --> 15:49.600
Well, they're-they're
with an FBI agent.

15:49.635 --> 15:50.879
That is not enough for me.

15:50.903 --> 15:52.703
We're sending them
to a safe house.

15:52.738 --> 15:53.971
I want you there.

15:54.006 --> 15:55.639
How am I gonna know
if you're okay?

15:55.674 --> 15:57.407
You're tying my hands
behind my back.

15:57.443 --> 16:00.744
Dad, I have never needed you
more than I do now.

16:00.779 --> 16:03.013
Please, do this for me.

16:03.048 --> 16:06.083
Of course.

16:15.761 --> 16:17.027
Javor Nicovic?

16:17.062 --> 16:18.695
Yeah. How can I help you?

16:18.731 --> 16:21.131
FBI, Special Agent
Seeley Booth.

16:21.166 --> 16:21.684
Special Agent James Aubrey.

16:21.708 --> 16:23.401
Hey, I don't understand.
What's this about?

16:23.402 --> 16:26.069
Put your hands
on the bar, please.

16:26.105 --> 16:29.139
Ooh! Do a lot of damage
with that, Javor.

16:29.174 --> 16:30.974
Show me a bartender
that doesn't keep a gun.

16:31.010 --> 16:32.142
It's licensed.

16:32.177 --> 16:33.544
Hey.
Whoa.

16:33.579 --> 16:36.413
Put your hands on the bar.
Don't move.

16:36.448 --> 16:38.515
Will you please tell me
what this is about?

16:38.551 --> 16:40.417
Yeah, Margaret Kwan.
Never heard of her.

16:40.452 --> 16:42.152
Yeah, well,
she was murdered.

16:42.187 --> 16:43.820
And our lab connected it
to your bar.

16:43.856 --> 16:45.088
Well, that's terrible,

16:45.124 --> 16:46.757
but this is not a place
for criminals.

16:46.792 --> 16:48.792
This is a community place
for my people.

16:48.827 --> 16:50.160
You recognize that guy there?

16:50.195 --> 16:51.862
Of course I do.

16:51.897 --> 16:53.931
Everybody from Serbia
knows about General Radik.

16:53.966 --> 16:55.098
Those kind of people are why

16:55.134 --> 16:56.466
we left Serbia.

16:56.502 --> 16:58.235
Any of them ever show up here?

16:58.270 --> 17:01.204
I told you, this place
is not for criminals.

17:02.608 --> 17:04.473
What, Booth?

17:04.510 --> 17:05.909
Hand me that picture.

17:13.986 --> 17:15.551
Who is this? You know him?

17:15.588 --> 17:17.421
Mark Kovac.
He was a good player

17:17.455 --> 17:18.989
for our soccer team
some 20 years ago.

17:19.023 --> 17:20.201
Does he still come in here now?

17:20.224 --> 17:21.592
Yeah, to play pool.

18:21.328 --> 18:24.386
Hey. So, it's Mark Kovac.

18:24.387 --> 18:26.020
He came to this country
when he was eight

18:26.055 --> 18:28.156
via a Red Cross
refugee program.

18:28.191 --> 18:29.657
I'm sure this is important.

18:29.692 --> 18:31.826
How about you
let me know why?

18:31.861 --> 18:33.861
That is General Radik's son.
This is our guy.

18:33.897 --> 18:34.996
How do you know this?

18:35.031 --> 18:38.633
I just know.

18:38.668 --> 18:39.967
We need more than that, <i>Cher.</i>

18:40.003 --> 18:42.770
Immigration papers,
adoption records,

18:42.805 --> 18:45.406
something that directly
ties them together.

18:45.441 --> 18:46.819
Look, I'm just saying,
if something happens,

18:46.843 --> 18:49.343
I want you
to remember that name, Kovac.

18:49.379 --> 18:52.213
I don't like the tone
of your voice, Seeley.

18:52.248 --> 18:55.049
It disquiets me.
What's gonna happen?

18:55.084 --> 18:56.684
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

18:56.719 --> 18:59.053
I'm just saying
if something does...

18:59.088 --> 19:00.888
this is our guy.

19:04.427 --> 19:08.396
So, Mark Kovac is now 28,
married, no children,

19:08.431 --> 19:10.731
and works as an EMT.

19:10.767 --> 19:14.068
That is a productive and
honorable occupation.

19:14.103 --> 19:17.572
Yeah, well, everything
about him is pretty honorable.

19:17.607 --> 19:19.707
He was a war hero, one of ours.

19:19.742 --> 19:22.376
Two tours in Iraq
as a medic.

19:22.412 --> 19:25.780
Combat Infantryman Badge
and a Bronze Star.

19:25.815 --> 19:27.648
Is there any evidence showing

19:27.684 --> 19:31.085
that Mark Kovac
is General Radik's son?

19:31.120 --> 19:32.620
I've been looking
at birth records,

19:32.655 --> 19:34.099
but it would have been
right around the fall

19:34.123 --> 19:37.225
of the Soviet Union,
and government services

19:37.260 --> 19:38.593
in that region were a mess.

19:38.628 --> 19:40.428
That woman.

19:40.463 --> 19:42.930
"Sasha Radik."

19:42.966 --> 19:45.266
She would be
Mark Kovac's mother.

19:45.301 --> 19:49.103
I have an algorithm that can
mix and match facial features,

19:49.138 --> 19:50.838
so let me see if that'll work.

19:58.982 --> 20:01.148
Please extrapolate
the age backwards

20:01.184 --> 20:03.618
to Mark Kovac's
current age of 28.

20:08.891 --> 20:11.025
Similar zygomatic processes.

20:11.060 --> 20:13.828
Upward arching maxillas.

20:13.863 --> 20:15.830
The width of the mandibles

20:15.865 --> 20:17.765
are extremely similar.

20:17.800 --> 20:22.503
Mark Kovac is almost certainly
the product of the same parents.

20:26.542 --> 20:28.709
Mark Kovac?

20:28.745 --> 20:30.144
Special Agent Seeley Booth.

20:30.179 --> 20:32.947
This here is Special Agent
Aubrey from the FBI.

20:32.982 --> 20:34.048
FBI?

20:34.083 --> 20:36.150
Mark, what's this about?

20:36.185 --> 20:37.485
Can we come in?

20:37.520 --> 20:40.821
Uh, yeah.

20:40.857 --> 20:42.423
<i>Sure, I go to Eastland.</i>

20:42.458 --> 20:44.825
It's a chance to hear the
language I heard as a child.

20:44.861 --> 20:46.138
When was the last time
you were there?

20:46.162 --> 20:47.962
A few weeks ago.

20:47.997 --> 20:49.842
Seems like you're pretty
plugged into that community.

20:49.866 --> 20:51.644
Absolutely. I'm-I'm very proud
of my heritage.

20:51.668 --> 20:54.001
I know you didn't ask,
but I brought some coffee.

20:54.037 --> 20:55.703
Uh, we're fine, thank you.
We're okay.

20:55.738 --> 20:57.004
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.706
I didn't realize
that was inappropriate.

20:59.676 --> 21:02.810
Um, Mark, is everything okay?

21:02.845 --> 21:04.456
Yeah, everything's fine.
These men are just asking me

21:04.480 --> 21:06.347
some questions about Eastland.

21:06.382 --> 21:07.422
Do you mind
telling me why?

21:07.450 --> 21:08.894
Well, there was a murder
connected to the bar.

21:08.918 --> 21:10.651
Oh, my God, that's terrible.

21:10.687 --> 21:11.819
Who was murdered?

21:11.854 --> 21:14.121
What do you know about
General Josip Radik?

21:14.157 --> 21:17.024
Yeah, why are you
asking me about him?

21:17.060 --> 21:19.860
I-I know who Radik was,
everybody from Serbia does.

21:19.896 --> 21:21.407
- This is a murder investigation, Mark,
- Yeah.

21:21.431 --> 21:22.663
not really a good time to lie.

21:22.699 --> 21:25.700
I don't understand.
Lie about what?

21:31.708 --> 21:34.041
Josip Radik was
my biological father.

21:34.077 --> 21:36.358
I thought you said you didn't
know your biological father.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.454
Look, I never said that.
Mark, you said you were adopted.

21:38.455 --> 21:39.381
I was adopted.
I didn't lie about...

21:39.415 --> 21:40.626
You didn't tell me that
you knew your biological father?

21:40.650 --> 21:42.461
Well, I was gonna tell you
when the time was right.

21:42.485 --> 21:43.729
When were you gonna
tell me that?

21:43.753 --> 21:45.286
Mrs. Kovac,
please. Okay?

21:45.321 --> 21:46.398
We're asking the
questions here.

21:46.422 --> 21:48.189
I don't broadcast

21:48.224 --> 21:50.725
who my biological father was.

21:50.760 --> 21:52.560
You can probably imagine why.

21:52.595 --> 21:54.495
Why?

21:54.530 --> 21:55.863
Tell her, Mark.

21:57.467 --> 21:58.699
He was a war criminal.

21:58.735 --> 22:00.701
Oh, my God. A war criminal?

22:00.737 --> 22:02.937
Mark! Don't you think
I should've known about that?!

22:02.972 --> 22:05.539
I was six when he died.
You still should've told me.

22:05.575 --> 22:07.975
Okay, you guys can work that out
later-- look, we're looking

22:08.010 --> 22:09.288
for anyone who's
connected to the general.

22:10.613 --> 22:12.813
Look, I barely remember him.

22:12.849 --> 22:15.015
I was taken out of Serbia
by the Red Cross

22:15.051 --> 22:16.751
and I was placed
with a family here.

22:16.786 --> 22:18.419
As far as
I'm concerned,

22:18.454 --> 22:20.054
those are my parents!

22:20.089 --> 22:22.056
That man, Radik?

22:22.091 --> 22:23.824
That man wasn't my father.

22:26.629 --> 22:28.796
I'm so sorry.

22:35.138 --> 22:36.270
Hey.

22:36.305 --> 22:38.939
Cam, hey. So, I swabbed
the wrist and ankle

22:38.975 --> 22:40.274
skin samples you gave me.

22:40.309 --> 22:41.820
Any luck figuring out
what Margaret Kwan

22:41.844 --> 22:42.810
was strapped down with?

22:42.845 --> 22:44.011
Duct tape.

22:44.046 --> 22:45.579
The kind you can buy anywhere.

22:45.615 --> 22:47.481
Same that was used
on Aldo Clemens.

22:48.651 --> 22:49.917
Also, I found particulates

22:49.952 --> 22:51.619
of a discontinued
old talcum powder.

22:51.654 --> 22:53.087
How do you know
it was discontinued?

22:53.122 --> 22:54.500
Well, because it used to
have two percent asbestos

22:54.524 --> 22:55.456
in its makeup.

22:55.491 --> 22:57.024
Mm, yuck.
Yeah.

22:57.059 --> 22:59.126
And it's been banned
for the past two decades

22:59.162 --> 23:00.928
because of its link to cancer.

23:00.963 --> 23:02.797
So, we should be looking
for a place

23:02.832 --> 23:04.732
that has old talc
sitting around?

23:04.767 --> 23:06.834
That, as well as
resilite vinyl.

23:06.869 --> 23:09.336
It's the stuff that they
use to make wrestling mats.

23:10.506 --> 23:11.539
So, maybe we should be

23:11.574 --> 23:14.208
looking for old abandoned gyms.

23:14.243 --> 23:15.921
Hold on a second.
Cam, didn't the killer use

23:15.945 --> 23:18.212
an abandoned recording studio
for Aldo's murder?

23:29.859 --> 23:31.358
Stop right...

23:31.394 --> 23:33.327
Hold you fire, Aubrey,
it's only little old me.

23:33.362 --> 23:35.007
You still managed
to scare the hell out of me.

23:35.031 --> 23:37.164
Where's your partner?
He's looking for Mike.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.300
Tell him about
what I'm showing you.

23:39.335 --> 23:41.902
He'll understand.
You only get one look.

23:43.139 --> 23:45.739
And it never leaves my sight.

23:45.775 --> 23:47.408
Okay.

23:48.811 --> 23:50.322
Ooh, this is Mark Kovac's
psych evaluations

23:50.346 --> 23:51.712
from the military?

23:51.747 --> 23:54.315
Strictly off-limits
without a court order.

23:54.350 --> 23:57.151
That would take days
for me to obtain.

23:57.186 --> 23:58.285
Have you read them?

23:58.321 --> 23:59.253
If I had,

23:59.288 --> 24:00.588
I would have seen

24:00.623 --> 24:02.623
multiple assessments that say

24:02.658 --> 24:05.826
Kovac had no disorders
whatsoever.

24:05.862 --> 24:08.240
Well, I don't understand, that
just confirms what he told us.

24:08.264 --> 24:09.930
He's completely clean.

24:09.966 --> 24:13.000
Have you ever met anyone
with no neuroses, no OCD,

24:13.035 --> 24:15.069
no hint of anger issues?

24:15.104 --> 24:17.371
I guess everybody's
got something.

24:17.406 --> 24:19.340
Especially a son
of a war criminal

24:19.375 --> 24:20.875
who saw his father killed

24:20.910 --> 24:23.110
and then served
in combat himself.

24:23.145 --> 24:25.079
So he's got to be
hiding something.

24:25.114 --> 24:26.614
Or he's a complete psychopath.

24:26.649 --> 24:28.015
One thing I know from

24:28.050 --> 24:30.584
spending most of my life
prosecuting murderers:

24:30.620 --> 24:33.087
a man with no disorders
whatsoever

24:33.122 --> 24:35.389
is always hiding something.

24:37.927 --> 24:40.694
Oh. Agents found another body
in an abandoned gym

24:40.730 --> 24:41.929
in Bethesda.

24:41.964 --> 24:43.342
Booth's on his way,
I better get there.

24:43.366 --> 24:44.798
You're forgetting something,
<i>Cher.</i>

24:44.834 --> 24:47.034
Oh, right.

25:06.422 --> 25:08.255
There was no I.D.

25:08.291 --> 25:10.758
But based on height and weight,
he matches the description.

25:10.793 --> 25:11.825
Check his left arm.

25:11.861 --> 25:12.927
Okay. Where?

25:12.962 --> 25:14.161
Right below his shoulder.

25:22.905 --> 25:25.005
<i>"Sua Sponte."</i> Latin.

25:25.041 --> 25:26.440
"Of their own accord."

25:28.511 --> 25:31.645
It's a Ranger motto.
I was with Mike when he got it.

25:33.549 --> 25:36.317
I'm sorry, Booth.
This was bad.

25:39.422 --> 25:40.766
This must have been where
Margaret Kwan was tortured.

25:40.790 --> 25:43.824
She was positioned right
in Mike's sightline.

25:48.898 --> 25:50.664
You okay?

25:50.700 --> 25:52.800
No. Should I be?

25:52.835 --> 25:55.169
No.

25:59.875 --> 26:01.041
Okay. This is weird.

26:01.077 --> 26:02.142
What?

26:02.178 --> 26:04.445
Well, the body...

26:04.480 --> 26:06.080
your friend.

26:06.115 --> 26:08.582
The techs assumed,
based on the way it looked,

26:08.618 --> 26:10.651
he'd been here a while.
He hasn't?

26:10.686 --> 26:12.853
He's been dead an hour at most.

26:21.092 --> 26:23.225
The maxillary sinuses
have multiple scratches

26:23.260 --> 26:25.828
that appear to have been made
with a sharp, thin object.

26:25.863 --> 26:27.196
How about an ice pick?

26:27.231 --> 26:28.630
That would do the job.

26:28.666 --> 26:30.733
Mike's nail beds
are lacerated,

26:30.768 --> 26:32.935
because the fingernails
were torn from the phalanges.

26:32.970 --> 26:34.203
Yeah.

26:34.238 --> 26:35.337
Most likely with these.

26:35.373 --> 26:37.339
I'm still seeing keratin residue

26:37.375 --> 26:39.775
in the pliers'
jaws. Wow.

26:39.810 --> 26:41.777
This guy used
every tool in the set.

26:41.812 --> 26:43.178
And every region of the body.

26:43.214 --> 26:45.147
The patellae show
an extensive amount

26:45.182 --> 26:47.082
of blunt force trauma.

26:47.118 --> 26:48.638
That actually correlates
to the hammer.

26:49.787 --> 26:51.298
Yeah. The diameter
of the hammer's head

26:51.322 --> 26:53.922
suggests it was the same
one used on Margaret Kwan.

26:55.493 --> 26:57.860
The size of the fractures
are identical.

26:57.895 --> 26:59.539
However, the extent to which
Mike Reiss was tortured

26:59.563 --> 27:01.830
far exceeds what was
done to Margaret Kwan.

27:04.201 --> 27:06.568
Margaret's torture
appears to have been an effort

27:06.604 --> 27:08.137
to obtain information.

27:08.172 --> 27:11.140
Once the killer had it,
he quickly ended her life.

27:11.175 --> 27:13.509
Troponin enzyme levels and
elevated stress hormones

27:13.544 --> 27:14.710
in Mike's blood

27:14.745 --> 27:17.012
indicate he died
of cardiac arrest.

27:17.048 --> 27:18.747
So then, why keep
torturing Mike

27:18.783 --> 27:20.849
if he already told the killer
everything he knew?

27:20.885 --> 27:22.251
For the pleasure of it.

27:22.286 --> 27:23.619
I'm aware Dr. Brennan considers

27:23.654 --> 27:26.422
the field of psychology
a-a soft science,

27:26.457 --> 27:27.790
but do you guys happen to know

27:27.825 --> 27:29.691
about the concept
of the dark tetrad?

27:29.727 --> 27:32.294
Yeah. It's the
diagnosis of individuals

27:32.329 --> 27:35.197
who share the same four sinister
personality traits.

27:35.232 --> 27:36.999
Narcissism, sadism,

27:37.034 --> 27:38.834
Machiavellianism
and psychopathy.

27:38.869 --> 27:41.070
Well, our killer
ticks every box.

27:41.105 --> 27:43.116
I don't think Dr. Brennan
would encourage us to analyze

27:43.140 --> 27:45.374
this killer psychologically,
but it's clear to me,

27:45.409 --> 27:47.443
this person is certainly sick.

27:47.478 --> 27:49.011
And dangerous.

27:49.046 --> 27:51.346
Which means we have to find
him before he finds Booth.

27:57.121 --> 27:58.687
Hey. I need to talk to you.

27:58.722 --> 28:00.789
I heard about Reiss.
How's you partner taking it?

28:00.825 --> 28:03.125
Blaming himself for not
getting there sooner.

28:03.160 --> 28:04.493
He can't take that on.

28:04.528 --> 28:05.761
Reiss didn't have a chance.

28:05.796 --> 28:06.995
Good luck telling him that.

28:07.031 --> 28:08.564
Look, there's got to
be something more

28:08.599 --> 28:09.965
that we can bring Kovac in on.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.611
You and I both know
that he's behind this.

28:11.635 --> 28:14.336
I bent the rules to get you
those psych files.

28:14.371 --> 28:15.904
Now you want more?

28:15.940 --> 28:19.475
You FBI boys are cute,
but not lose-my-job cute.

28:19.510 --> 28:21.221
Well, then we've got a problem
because we need more evidence

28:21.245 --> 28:22.856
to get a warrant, but we're
not getting a warrant

28:22.880 --> 28:24.746
without some evidence here.

28:24.782 --> 28:26.048
Yeah. It's a paradox.

28:26.083 --> 28:27.494
Let me know when you've
untangled it.

28:27.518 --> 28:30.085
Caroline, come on.
This guy is after Booth.

28:30.121 --> 28:31.553
I get it.

28:31.589 --> 28:33.422
But how am I gonna find a judge

28:33.457 --> 28:36.225
who isn't going
to demand probable cause?

28:36.260 --> 28:37.926
Caroline, please.

28:37.962 --> 28:39.695
My partner needs this.

28:40.564 --> 28:42.598
I'll do what I can.

28:42.633 --> 28:44.433
But no promises.

28:46.837 --> 28:48.615
I've been working on the
killer's communications

28:48.639 --> 28:49.872
from that gym.

28:49.907 --> 28:51.340
What communications?

28:51.375 --> 28:54.109
He didn't leave any cell
phones or laptops behind.

28:54.145 --> 28:56.545
Well, I've been checking out
Wi-Fi usage in the area.

28:56.580 --> 28:58.947
There's no service
in that abandoned gym,

28:58.983 --> 29:04.119
but I did find 11 wireless
routers in the vicinity.

29:04.155 --> 29:06.255
And a computer that was
piggybacking a signal

29:06.290 --> 29:07.456
from this place,

29:07.491 --> 29:10.425
Nancy's Cuts & Curls.

29:10.461 --> 29:13.962
Are you sure it wasn't a
customer in for a cut or a curl?

29:13.998 --> 29:15.264
No.

29:15.299 --> 29:17.466
This person had an agenda.

29:17.501 --> 29:20.802
Look at what they
were searching for.

29:29.613 --> 29:30.813
Wait a second,
what do you mean

29:30.848 --> 29:32.025
you couldn't get
a search warrant?

29:32.049 --> 29:33.148
I went to three judges.

29:33.184 --> 29:34.316
None would sign off.

29:34.351 --> 29:35.751
You have no
probable cause.

29:35.786 --> 29:37.430
I am not waiting for Kovac
to make the next move.

29:37.454 --> 29:38.598
What do you propose, then?
I don't know.

29:38.622 --> 29:40.189
Bring him in on
a parking ticket,

29:40.224 --> 29:41.490
a house code violation,

29:41.525 --> 29:42.991
a broken tail light
if you have to.

29:43.027 --> 29:44.259
Just bring him in.

29:44.295 --> 29:45.994
If he gets a restraining
order against you,

29:46.030 --> 29:47.296
you're off the case

29:47.331 --> 29:48.475
and there's nothing I can do.

29:48.499 --> 29:51.433
I'll take my chances, okay?

29:53.003 --> 29:55.637
Maybe you won't have to.

29:55.673 --> 29:57.306
What the hell is he doing here?

29:57.341 --> 29:58.473
Agent Booth.

29:59.243 --> 30:01.643
I need your help.

30:07.885 --> 30:10.385
I found evidence
of electrolytes

30:10.421 --> 30:13.488
and TPN
in Mike Reiss's system.

30:13.524 --> 30:16.124
Glucose, amino acids, lipids.

30:16.160 --> 30:17.926
All components
of a maintenance IV.

30:17.962 --> 30:20.395
Mike was being kept alive
to extend the torture.

30:20.431 --> 30:24.766
Why did both of you come here
to give me this information?

30:24.802 --> 30:27.402
We wanted to see how you were.

30:27.438 --> 30:29.238
Not well.

30:29.273 --> 30:32.107
I find it difficult being
separated from my children.

30:32.142 --> 30:34.076
Well, no one would blame you
for being with them.

30:34.111 --> 30:36.178
This is not going to end

30:36.213 --> 30:38.247
until we find evidence
to stop Mark Kovac.

30:38.282 --> 30:39.648
Usually,

30:39.683 --> 30:41.683
you let the evidence lead you
to the suspect.

30:41.719 --> 30:43.318
How are you so sure it's Kovac?

30:43.354 --> 30:46.054
Kovac is the son
of a man Booth killed.

30:46.090 --> 30:48.690
And he has paramedic training,
which is consistent with the IV.

30:48.726 --> 30:50.792
Normally,

30:50.828 --> 30:53.795
you'd insist on a higher degree
of evidence, Dr. Brennan.

30:53.831 --> 30:56.598
These are not
normal circumstances.

30:59.203 --> 31:01.603
Okay, you do realize
that I am recording this?

31:01.639 --> 31:03.238
You have to say yes.

31:03.274 --> 31:04.973
Yes.

31:05.009 --> 31:06.886
All right, so why don't we start
with why you're here.

31:06.910 --> 31:08.188
Look, I know this is
gonna sound nuts,

31:08.212 --> 31:09.678
but I think somebody's trying

31:09.713 --> 31:11.691
to pin both those murders on me.
Wait a second, Mark.

31:11.715 --> 31:13.015
We only talked
about one murder,

31:13.050 --> 31:14.383
and that was Margaret Kwan.

31:14.418 --> 31:15.895
I saw the news that
you found another body

31:15.919 --> 31:18.053
at that abandoned
gym in Bethesda.

31:18.088 --> 31:20.404
That's... that's my
wife's old listing.

31:20.428 --> 31:21.357
Listing?

31:21.358 --> 31:23.058
Jeannine's a commercial
real estate agent.

31:23.093 --> 31:24.526
Okay, so Radik was your father.

31:24.561 --> 31:26.194
Now you're connected
to a crime scene.

31:26.230 --> 31:27.729
Yeah, it's worse than that.

31:27.765 --> 31:29.276
That old recording studio
where they found that body

31:29.300 --> 31:30.610
around a month ago,
that's Jeannine's, too.

31:30.634 --> 31:32.901
Well, I'm assuming

31:32.936 --> 31:34.014
that you wouldn't be here
unless there

31:34.038 --> 31:35.537
was some sort of explanation.

31:35.572 --> 31:37.017
Somebody must be using
Jeannine's old listings.

31:37.041 --> 31:38.740
That doesn't wash with me, Mark.

31:38.776 --> 31:41.243
Hey, this has nothing
to do with me.

31:42.980 --> 31:44.090
All right, you know what?
You're giving me

31:44.114 --> 31:45.158
no reason but to lock you up.

31:45.182 --> 31:46.448
Please, Agent Booth.

31:46.483 --> 31:49.451
I'm the victim here.

31:51.322 --> 31:52.654
I need to talk to you.

31:55.726 --> 31:58.927
Hey... I'm just trying
to work things out.

31:58.962 --> 32:00.896
Yeah, what is it?

32:00.931 --> 32:02.497
There's been a shooting.

32:02.533 --> 32:05.901
It was the safe house where
we put Max and the kids,

32:05.936 --> 32:07.936
but we don't
know anything...

32:15.997 --> 32:17.397
Where are they?

32:17.432 --> 32:18.832
Come on!
Wait... Hank!

32:18.867 --> 32:20.867
- Come on!
- Christine! Where are they?!

32:20.902 --> 32:23.736
Booth, over here!
There, there, there. They're over there.

32:23.772 --> 32:25.305
Hank, Christine!

32:25.340 --> 32:27.507
Come here, come here, you okay?
What's going on, Daddy?

32:27.542 --> 32:29.409
It's okay.
All right.

32:29.444 --> 32:30.955
Okay, everything's
gonna be okay, all right?

32:30.979 --> 32:32.056
Don't be scared.
We-we're here, honey.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.813
Where-Where's Grandpa?
Bones.

32:35.617 --> 32:37.083
Mommy, don't go.

32:37.118 --> 32:38.396
Hold on, honey.
I'll be right back. I promise.

32:38.420 --> 32:39.519
Be right back.

32:39.554 --> 32:41.654
Dad. Dad!

32:41.690 --> 32:43.489
All right.
I'm here.

32:43.525 --> 32:45.024
Hey.
I'll make sure you're okay.

32:45.060 --> 32:46.593
I'm fine, I'm fine.

32:46.628 --> 32:49.195
Nothing that I haven't
been through before.

32:49.231 --> 32:51.231
How are the kids?
The kids are fine.

32:51.266 --> 32:53.366
Who did this to you, Max?
Two guys.

32:53.401 --> 32:54.745
We need to get him
to the hospital now.

32:54.769 --> 32:57.036
I'm coming with you.
Oh, that... No, I'm fine.

32:57.072 --> 32:59.439
No arguments.
I'm coming with you.

32:59.474 --> 33:00.551
He's got some bullets in him.

33:00.575 --> 33:02.108
We stabilized
the hemorrhaging, but...

33:02.143 --> 33:03.654
Bones, go with him. Everything's
gonna be fine, okay?

33:03.678 --> 33:05.845
I'll make sure everything's okay
back here.

33:10.385 --> 33:12.785
Tom, what the hell happened?

33:12.821 --> 33:14.287
Two gunmen ambushed
the safe house.

33:14.322 --> 33:15.967
How the hell'd they find it?
It's a safe house.

33:15.991 --> 33:17.602
We're working on it.
That means you got nothing.

33:17.626 --> 33:19.604
- I want to talk to all the shooters.
- Both were killed.

33:19.628 --> 33:21.761
So was Agent Chatterjee,
stationed at the entrance.

33:21.796 --> 33:23.329
They came through
the side yard.

33:23.365 --> 33:25.131
Blew the door
with an RPG.

33:29.704 --> 33:32.138
Wounds are tightly clustered.
High intensity rounds.

33:32.173 --> 33:34.674
They went right through
her Kevlar vest.

33:34.709 --> 33:35.942
These guys are well-trained.

33:35.977 --> 33:38.144
They weren't expecting
your father-in-law.

33:44.953 --> 33:46.219
Okay, go ahead.

33:46.254 --> 33:47.320
What happened, Austin?

33:47.355 --> 33:48.721
They came through the yard,

33:48.757 --> 33:50.356
tripped the sensors.

33:50.392 --> 33:53.026
Max put the children
in the basement.

33:53.061 --> 33:55.295
Max came up
on this guy's blind side.

33:55.330 --> 33:56.629
Yeah, he saved my life.

33:56.665 --> 33:59.165
Stood his ground
and got off a full clip.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.600
How much did the kids see?

34:00.635 --> 34:02.313
Your father-in-law made sure
they saw nothing.

34:02.337 --> 34:03.748
He turned up the TV
so they wouldn't hear anything,

34:03.772 --> 34:05.338
and we took 'em out
through the back.

34:05.373 --> 34:08.206
Who are these guys?
We pulled fingerprints.

34:08.243 --> 34:10.476
Their names are Goran Milovic
and Andre Belgrader.

34:10.512 --> 34:13.279
Yeah, one of them,
as he was bleeding out,

34:13.315 --> 34:15.081
kept saying <i>"majka."</i>

34:16.318 --> 34:17.183
Evidently it's Serbian.

34:17.217 --> 34:19.351
For "mother."

34:20.922 --> 34:23.690
Max is stable
and going into surgery.

34:23.725 --> 34:25.891
Ah, good. He's tough.
He's gonna be okay.

34:25.927 --> 34:28.194
Okay, so Milovic and Belgrader

34:28.228 --> 34:30.763
were both Radik's
bodyguards in Serbia.

34:30.799 --> 34:33.833
I checked cybersecurity
with both the DOJ and the FBI,

34:33.868 --> 34:36.202
and there were no security
breaches on either one of them.

34:36.237 --> 34:37.370
Was it an inside man?

34:37.405 --> 34:39.539
Unlikely. The team
was picked by Booth.

34:39.574 --> 34:41.641
Then they had to have been
tracking the family.

34:41.676 --> 34:42.853
Yeah, but how?
Brennan made Max leave

34:42.877 --> 34:44.377
his phone at the Jeffersonian.

34:44.411 --> 34:47.013
And she wouldn't even let
Christine take her iPad.

34:47.047 --> 34:48.982
So there were no
devices to track.

34:49.016 --> 34:50.350
Wait, Brennan said that Max

34:50.385 --> 34:52.585
recently had
a pacemaker implanted.

34:52.620 --> 34:55.621
Pacemakers send GPS signals
to their doctors.

34:55.657 --> 34:58.291
Max was a patient at
the St. Francis Medical Center.

34:58.326 --> 35:00.093
I can get on their server.

35:01.963 --> 35:04.998
The pacemaker was the link.

35:05.033 --> 35:07.400
But it looks like
someone was still pinging it

35:07.435 --> 35:11.738
for GPS information even after
the bodyguards were shot dead.

35:11.773 --> 35:13.072
So this isn't over.

35:19.447 --> 35:21.147
Tell me
those children are okay.

35:21.182 --> 35:22.348
They will be.

35:22.384 --> 35:23.616
And your father-in-law?

35:23.651 --> 35:25.952
Getting surgery.
Bones is at the hospital.

35:25.987 --> 35:28.054
Seeley, we can't
hold Kovac much longer.

35:28.089 --> 35:30.656
I'm not gonna hold him anymore.
I'm gonna take him down.

35:32.560 --> 35:35.395
So, you used
my father-in-law's

35:35.430 --> 35:36.929
pacemaker to locate
the safe house.

35:36.965 --> 35:39.365
I came here for help.
Why would I do that?

35:39.401 --> 35:40.733
To see the look
on my face

35:40.769 --> 35:42.735
when they tell me
my children are dead.

35:42.771 --> 35:44.070
That's crazy.
Really?

35:44.105 --> 35:45.872
Because it says here
that General Josip Radik

35:45.907 --> 35:48.641
was shot at long range
during his son's sixth birthday.

35:48.676 --> 35:50.076
September 15,

35:50.111 --> 35:52.078
1995.

35:52.113 --> 35:53.146
I don't remember that.

35:53.181 --> 35:54.547
I must have blocked that out.

35:54.582 --> 35:56.293
Well, let me help remind you.
There was a party.

35:56.317 --> 35:57.850
There were a lot
of people there.

35:57.886 --> 35:59.519
It was fun. There was cake.

36:03.458 --> 36:05.925
- The general's blood splattered all over
- You can stop.

36:05.960 --> 36:07.171
the boy who was celebrating....

36:07.195 --> 36:09.262
You can stop!

36:09.297 --> 36:11.130
That must've been
a nightmare for you,

36:11.166 --> 36:12.365
'cause you love your dad.

36:12.400 --> 36:13.533
My father was a monster.

36:13.568 --> 36:14.568
Yeah,
but he was still

36:14.602 --> 36:16.836
your dad, right?

36:23.645 --> 36:25.211
Who are you?

36:25.246 --> 36:26.179
I'm Mr. Kovac's lawyer.

36:26.214 --> 36:27.947
I'll be with you in a moment.
No.

36:27.982 --> 36:30.302
My client will not answer any
more questions until we talk.

36:50.138 --> 36:52.238
Dr. Vaziri.
I'm looking

36:52.273 --> 36:53.417
I'm looking at
Mike Reiss' bones,

36:53.441 --> 36:54.685
and there's
some unusual contusions

36:54.709 --> 36:56.187
on the anterior surfaces
of the sternal ribs.

36:56.211 --> 36:59.745
The marks seem to form
an oval pattern.

36:59.781 --> 37:01.781
There's fracturing,
yet there's no sign of impact.

37:01.816 --> 37:03.983
It doesn't make any sense.

37:04.018 --> 37:05.985
I concur that this is not
an impact fracture.

37:06.020 --> 37:07.720
What else could it be?

37:07.755 --> 37:09.033
We know the killer
administered an IV

37:09.057 --> 37:11.891
to Mike Reiss
to prolong torture.

37:11.926 --> 37:14.594
Is it possible he had access
to a defibrillator?

37:14.629 --> 37:15.895
Of course!

37:15.930 --> 37:18.097
Mark Kovac is a paramedic.

37:21.903 --> 37:23.970
The bruise is an exact match
for the shape

37:24.005 --> 37:26.372
of a defibrillator paddle.

37:26.407 --> 37:28.141
Dr. Brennan,
your father's out of surgery.

37:28.176 --> 37:31.277
Okay, um, Dr. Vaziri,
I need you to call Booth.

37:34.682 --> 37:35.915
Take a good look, Mark.

37:35.950 --> 37:39.285
Crime techs did
a sweep of your ambulance.

37:39.320 --> 37:41.087
According to
the report,

37:41.122 --> 37:42.555
you cleaned
your defibrillator pads

37:42.590 --> 37:45.258
with accelerated
hydrogen peroxide.

37:45.293 --> 37:46.926
A good EMT always cleans
his pads

37:46.961 --> 37:48.995
before and after every shift.

37:49.030 --> 37:50.997
You cleaned your machine, too.

37:51.032 --> 37:53.110
As my client has explained,
it is important to maintain

37:53.134 --> 37:54.800
a sanitary environment.

37:55.837 --> 37:56.936
Forgot your cord, Mark.

37:56.971 --> 37:59.438
With all its nooks
and crannies.

37:59.474 --> 38:02.708
Turns out, when you shock
someone with 800 volts,

38:02.744 --> 38:06.279
saliva and sweat and God
knows what gets tossed around.

38:06.314 --> 38:07.947
Mike Reiss' DNA is in there.

38:07.982 --> 38:09.248
My client did not...

38:09.284 --> 38:11.517
I do not need a confession.

38:11.553 --> 38:13.352
I got him.

38:13.388 --> 38:14.820
You're done.

38:16.491 --> 38:20.526
Did you kill my father,
Agent Booth?

38:21.763 --> 38:24.830
I ask the questions here.
Let's go.

38:42.750 --> 38:44.517
Tempe.

38:46.187 --> 38:48.688
How you feeling, Dad?

38:48.723 --> 38:51.324
Thirsty.
That's from

38:51.359 --> 38:56.429
the laryngeal airway tube
that was used to intubate you.

38:56.464 --> 38:59.031
The soreness will go
away in a few days.

38:59.067 --> 39:01.234
Christine and Hank?

39:01.269 --> 39:03.169
They're fine.

39:03.204 --> 39:06.105
At home, worried
about their grandpa.

39:06.140 --> 39:08.007
And Booth?

39:08.042 --> 39:11.510
He has what he needs to put
Mark Kovac away for good.

39:13.081 --> 39:15.014
You mad at me?

39:15.049 --> 39:17.650
Why would I be mad at you?

39:17.685 --> 39:19.986
The pacemaker. I...

39:20.021 --> 39:22.855
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about it.

39:22.890 --> 39:26.259
No, I'm-I'm not mad.

39:26.294 --> 39:28.527
But for future reference,

39:28.563 --> 39:30.830
it's preferable to be informed

39:30.865 --> 39:33.432
of any pending
medical procedures.

39:33.468 --> 39:35.201
I'll try.

39:37.505 --> 39:40.306
I was just dreaming about you.

39:40.341 --> 39:42.942
What was
the dream?

39:45.113 --> 39:48.247
You were a little girl.

39:48.283 --> 39:51.250
And we were in the car, driving.

39:51.286 --> 39:54.387
The whole family.

39:55.490 --> 39:59.058
Your mom and Russ were with us.

39:59.093 --> 40:01.761
The leaves
were turning,

40:01.796 --> 40:04.764
changing.

40:04.799 --> 40:08.067
And it started to drizzle.

40:08.102 --> 40:10.703
It was so quiet

40:10.738 --> 40:13.939
you could hear
the raindrops falling

40:13.975 --> 40:17.243
on the windshield.

40:17.278 --> 40:19.679
And you were in the back,

40:19.714 --> 40:23.516
doing that thing you do

40:23.551 --> 40:25.418
with my ear.

40:25.453 --> 40:28.721
Rubbing your earlobes?

40:28.756 --> 40:31.691
It always put me at ease
when I was driving.

40:36.130 --> 40:38.764
And all those years

40:38.800 --> 40:41.334
I was gone...

40:42.637 --> 40:46.005
...whenever I missed you,

40:46.040 --> 40:48.641
I'd just think back

40:48.676 --> 40:52.078
on the rides in the car.

40:58.820 --> 40:59.885
Dad?

40:59.921 --> 41:01.287
Dad?

41:01.322 --> 41:03.823
No, no, no.

41:03.858 --> 41:05.624
No, no... Dad.
No, no, no, no, no.

41:05.660 --> 41:07.126
Okay, what do we got?

41:07.161 --> 41:09.295
I-I can help you with this!

41:09.330 --> 41:11.697
- Please, let us do our job, ma'am.
- Dad, I'm right here!

41:14.068 --> 41:16.502
I'm right here, Dad.
Heartbeat's still dropping!
