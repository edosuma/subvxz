00:21.100 --> 00:22.039
You need another bag ?

00:22.766 --> 00:23.798
Yo, Mike, where you at ?

00:24.443 --> 00:25.147
Yeah, over here.

00:26.225 --> 00:26.874
Drug war ?

00:31.611 --> 00:33.758
Barksdals coming back
on my boy Marlo, hmm ?

00:35.823 --> 00:36.315
Shit.

00:37.441 --> 00:37.816
Got it.

00:46.155 --> 00:47.622
Yo man, I don't know where we at.

00:48.654 --> 00:50.612
We are in Baltimore, Lamar.

00:51.598 --> 00:52.701
Baltimore, Maryland.

02:00.960 --> 02:03.846
That's the second crib of mine
them motherfuckers cracked this week.

02:04.621 --> 02:06.005
Stir up a hornet's nest

02:06.720 --> 02:08.186
no tellin' who gonna get stung.

02:17.832 --> 02:19.275
All paranoid an' shit.

02:20.312 --> 02:20.839
Got to be.

02:38.171 --> 02:39.181
They got Latroy.

02:42.556 --> 02:44.609
What the fuck is y'all
on the streets for, man ?

02:44.633 --> 02:47.025
Don't you all know there's
a fucking war going on, man ?

02:47.050 --> 02:48.421
Get the fuck in the truck, man.

03:21.035 --> 03:22.455
What happened to all them towers ?

03:23.581 --> 03:24.543
Slow train comin'.

03:28.977 --> 03:30.044
Reform, Lamar.

03:31.487 --> 03:32.201
Reform.

05:06.944 --> 05:08.069
Reformation

05:28.149 --> 05:30.518
We should be up on
this shit, hearin' voices.

05:30.953 --> 05:33.264
We get a signature number
on Bodie's phone, we will be.

05:33.311 --> 05:35.118
We got enough P.C.
off the burners alone.

05:35.727 --> 05:38.084
Every time these fucking pen
registers click out a call

05:38.119 --> 05:39.371
it screams drug conspiracy.

05:39.395 --> 05:41.272
I'm not the one
takin' the case to court.

05:41.307 --> 05:44.121
Pearlman wants a specific link
to a known drug trafficker.

05:51.185 --> 05:52.194
These drug crews ?

05:52.370 --> 05:54.599
They're dumping phones
every couple weeks at best.

05:54.763 --> 05:57.132
So when we do get a wire up,
it's gonna be a limited run.

05:57.308 --> 05:59.885
And dumping phones doesn't
meet the cellular company's

05:59.897 --> 06:01.928
definition of exigent
circumstance, huh ?

06:03.309 --> 06:04.741
What's your boss willing to do ?

06:05.258 --> 06:05.797
Demper ?

06:06.302 --> 06:09.056
He's a bit too focused on next
year's re-election fight.

06:09.220 --> 06:10.082
How about the feds ?

06:10.486 --> 06:12.282
They say they can't
do anything for us

06:12.563 --> 06:15.155
and if you look at how they use
the federal communications act

06:15.168 --> 06:15.988
they're not lying.

06:16.388 --> 06:18.674
For national security stuff,
they use the Patriot Act

06:18.909 --> 06:20.246
every thing else gets shorted.

06:20.914 --> 06:23.248
The fact is, the industry
has all of us by the balls.

06:26.556 --> 06:27.894
Pardon my french, Your Honor.

06:29.876 --> 06:31.061
Alright, I'll tell you what.

06:31.296 --> 06:32.632
Best I can do for you is this:

06:33.078 --> 06:36.468
You give me a boilerplate affidavit
with the P.C. from the court report

06:37.747 --> 06:40.187
and then as you get fresh
numbers for new disposables

06:40.205 --> 06:40.921
you call me...

06:41.965 --> 06:45.073
anytime, day or night,
to jump phones.

06:45.461 --> 06:46.351
That helps.

06:46.810 --> 06:48.263
But we're still gonna be getting up

06:48.276 --> 06:50.164
on their phones even
as they're coming down.

06:50.172 --> 06:50.946
Yeah, probably so.

06:50.947 --> 06:53.058
- This is so totally...
- fucked up ?

06:55.334 --> 07:02.689
"Je parle français bien,
et tu es très charmant aujourd'hui."

07:08.084 --> 07:09.890
Judge Phelan has you on his mind.

07:10.949 --> 07:12.381
How long has that been going on ?

07:13.166 --> 07:13.893
Started with...

07:15.160 --> 07:17.107
my first jury trial
in his court, I think.

07:17.588 --> 07:18.925
I bet you won all your motions.

07:24.784 --> 07:25.922
You wanted to see me, sir ?

07:26.509 --> 07:27.130
Have a seat.

07:31.846 --> 07:33.727
I wanna thank you for
the loyalty you showed

07:34.514 --> 07:35.382
moving that body.

07:37.175 --> 07:39.181
It wasn't the most
sensible thing, but...

07:39.452 --> 07:40.633
I appreciate it nonetheless.

07:42.056 --> 07:43.278
You're a good man, Sergeant

07:44.189 --> 07:45.268
you got good instincts

07:45.784 --> 07:48.282
and as far as I can tell
you're a decent supervisor.

07:50.053 --> 07:51.027
But from where I sit

07:52.657 --> 07:54.431
you ain't shit when
it come to policin'.

07:55.416 --> 07:57.528
Don't take it personal,
ain't just you.

07:57.551 --> 07:59.452
It's all our young police.

08:00.191 --> 08:01.411
A whole generation of y'all.

08:02.443 --> 08:03.545
Now, you think about it:

08:05.035 --> 08:07.428
You been here over
a year now, Carver.

08:07.464 --> 08:09.399
You got nobody looking out for you

08:09.469 --> 08:11.040
nobody willing to talk to you.

08:12.566 --> 08:13.563
That about sum it up ?

08:15.252 --> 08:16.212
And that's a problem.

08:17.304 --> 08:18.816
And I didn't think
there was anyway

08:18.827 --> 08:20.505
I was ever gonna
get my head around it.

08:20.518 --> 08:22.617
But then Dozerman
gets shot for some bullshit...

08:25.042 --> 08:26.720
and that's when
I 'bout reach my limit.

08:28.044 --> 08:29.840
And that's when the idea
of the free zone

08:29.863 --> 08:30.966
of Hamsterdam come to me.

08:30.989 --> 08:34.049
Because this drug thing,
this ain't police work.

08:34.696 --> 08:35.868
No, it ain't.

08:37.253 --> 08:40.114
I mean, I can send any fool
with a badge and a gun

08:40.126 --> 08:42.554
up on those corners and
jack a crew and grab vials.

08:43.610 --> 08:44.325
But policing ?

08:46.860 --> 08:49.381
You call something a war,
and pretty soon

08:49.382 --> 08:51.897
everybody gonna running
around acting like warriors.

08:53.094 --> 08:55.393
They gonna be runnin'
around on a damn crusade

08:55.402 --> 08:58.181
stormin' corners, slappin' on
cuffs, rackin' up body counts.

08:59.942 --> 09:02.228
And when you at war,
you need a fuckin' enemy.

09:03.156 --> 09:04.187
And pretty soon

09:04.458 --> 09:07.521
damn near everybody on every
corner is your fuckin' enemy

09:08.412 --> 09:11.069
and soon the neighborhood that
you're supposed to be policin'

09:11.367 --> 09:12.752
that's just occupied territory.

09:15.238 --> 09:16.154
You follow this ?

09:17.128 --> 09:17.785
I think so.

09:18.481 --> 09:20.744
Look, the point I'm makin',
Carver, is this...

09:21.226 --> 09:23.818
soldierin' and policin',
they ain't the same thing.

09:24.486 --> 09:26.503
And before we went
and took the wrong turn

09:26.504 --> 09:28.404
and started with these war games

09:29.396 --> 09:32.117
the cop walked a beat,
and he learned that post.

09:34.006 --> 09:36.317
And if there were things
that happened up on that post

09:36.327 --> 09:38.545
whether there be a rape,
a robbery, a shooting...

09:39.378 --> 09:41.947
he had people out there helping
him, feeding him information.

09:43.474 --> 09:46.452
But every time I come to you,
my D.E.U. sergeant

09:46.985 --> 09:47.977
for information

09:48.545 --> 09:50.839
to find out what's going
on out there on them streets

09:52.233 --> 09:53.853
all that came back
was some bullshit.

09:55.674 --> 09:58.476
You had your stats, you had
your arrests, you had your seizures.

09:59.009 --> 10:01.620
But don't none of that amount
to shit when you talking about

10:01.632 --> 10:03.772
protecting a neighborhood
now, do it ?

10:10.978 --> 10:12.515
You know the worst
thing about this

10:13.969 --> 10:15.140
so called drug war ?

10:15.837 --> 10:16.700
To my mind ?

10:20.867 --> 10:23.268
It just ruined this job.

10:26.117 --> 10:26.768
Major ?

10:27.109 --> 10:27.879
What do you got ?

10:28.056 --> 10:28.708
Incoming.

10:29.475 --> 10:30.550
"Sunpapers" reporter.

10:30.929 --> 10:32.680
Been to the free zones,
all three of 'em.

10:35.435 --> 10:36.013
It's begun.

10:41.068 --> 10:43.419
I was thinkin', maybe
we rewrite the affidavit

10:43.431 --> 10:45.879
add some of the stuff we're
gettin' from the pen registers

10:45.890 --> 10:47.841
build the case that way,
take it to the judge.

10:47.865 --> 10:48.881
You have a law degree ?

10:48.989 --> 10:50.915
If you did, it would
be your call to make.

10:51.081 --> 10:53.102
Who would pretend to be
a lawyer that wasn't ?

10:54.403 --> 10:55.089
I'm just saying.

10:55.100 --> 10:56.886
I think we're being
too cautious on this.

10:56.898 --> 10:58.576
We're going the
extra mile for Phelan.

10:58.600 --> 11:01.035
A short cut now could cost us
later in motions hearings.

11:01.165 --> 11:02.768
We drew Phelan on this wiretap ?

11:02.993 --> 11:05.239
That two-faced hack sold
me out the last go-round.

11:05.334 --> 11:05.912
Relax...

11:06.610 --> 11:08.821
he's not running for
a new term. He'll be fine.

11:08.822 --> 11:10.003
He's a piece of shit.

11:10.087 --> 11:12.232
We're all pieces of shit
when we're in your way.

11:12.929 --> 11:14.394
That goes with the territory.

11:25.269 --> 11:26.119
Point taken.

11:28.365 --> 11:30.611
So it's these warehouses

11:30.824 --> 11:34.093
the old Winchester homes and the
dead blocks down by Vincent Street.

11:34.365 --> 11:35.133
All three.

11:36.174 --> 11:38.399
And they're just supposed
to let it go on like this ?

11:38.408 --> 11:41.139
Colvin told us to push the
street dealing in these areas

11:41.222 --> 11:43.225
then we would start
locking people up.

11:43.532 --> 11:45.329
But so far, not a single
fucking arrest.

11:45.683 --> 11:47.114
And they know about this downtown ?

11:47.137 --> 11:49.182
I don't think they have
a fucking clue about it.

11:49.195 --> 11:51.406
But I'd love to be there
when you pop the question.

11:54.161 --> 11:55.131
This is just...

11:56.195 --> 11:57.129
Tell me about it.

12:05.999 --> 12:07.607
Got the place lookin' good.

12:07.725 --> 12:08.292
Yeah.

12:08.493 --> 12:11.627
Now all needs doin' is to go
out and get you some kids.

12:11.910 --> 12:12.721
Come on, man.

12:13.444 --> 12:14.625
You makin' it sound easy

12:15.464 --> 12:16.989
but to tell you the truth

12:17.852 --> 12:20.323
I ain't got no idea how
to go at these hoppers.

12:20.347 --> 12:22.286
I wouldn't lose
any sleep over that.

12:22.924 --> 12:24.404
Nobody else does neither.

12:33.069 --> 12:33.933
We got one.

12:35.153 --> 12:35.875
His grandmother...

12:36.170 --> 12:36.903
<i>Looking for me ?</i>

12:36.915 --> 12:39.775
<i>Look, boy, there's no reason
to leave your clothes in the washer.</i>

12:39.835 --> 12:41.962
<i>How many damn times
do I have to tell you...</i>

12:41.987 --> 12:44.553
<i>Gag, grandma, sorry,
I just forgot, okay ?</i>

12:44.931 --> 12:47.238
<i>But I did pick up the laundry
soap, I picked it up...</i>

12:47.262 --> 12:48.893
Laundry soap,
that's definitely code.

12:48.977 --> 12:51.589
Now, let's listen to an intercept
we made of Bodie Broadus

12:51.590 --> 12:54.130
when we were up on the pay
phones a couple years back.

12:55.264 --> 12:56.141
<i>I'm tellin' ya all</i>

12:56.257 --> 12:58.539
<i>I saw the boy he sayin'
he ain't got that thing.</i>

12:58.763 --> 13:00.206
Same voice, no question.

13:00.454 --> 13:01.494
I'll let the judge know.

13:02.062 --> 13:04.285
Reference the voice comparison
in the court report.

13:04.355 --> 13:05.538
We're up.

13:13.169 --> 13:14.528
Major Colvin, Western district.

13:14.753 --> 13:16.623
Banisky, "Sunpapers".

13:17.074 --> 13:18.362
So this your idea ?

13:22.784 --> 13:23.800
Mind if we walk ?

13:29.480 --> 13:31.325
You got dealers
selling with impunity.

13:32.070 --> 13:33.972
Addicts shooting up on the street.

13:34.623 --> 13:37.531
People down here doing outreach,
giving out needles and all.

13:38.134 --> 13:40.273
I mean, who knows about
this down at headquarters ?

13:40.285 --> 13:42.342
Command is well
aware of the situation

13:43.123 --> 13:45.795
and while there were
some initial concern

13:45.817 --> 13:48.023
but they feel the cases
that we're gonna bring in...

13:48.035 --> 13:48.579
Cases ?

13:49.016 --> 13:50.434
Yeah, prosecutions, sure.

13:50.459 --> 13:53.533
Your officers say no one's being
locked up in the free zones.

13:53.555 --> 13:55.819
My troops are only involved
in pushing the trafficking

13:55.829 --> 13:56.831
to designated areas.

13:56.913 --> 13:59.492
I mean they're completely ignorant
of the investigative aspect

13:59.501 --> 14:00.940
that's run out of C.I.D. downtown.

14:00.962 --> 14:01.530
Yeah ?

14:01.862 --> 14:03.067
Who's the lead detective ?

14:04.178 --> 14:04.900
Look...

14:06.723 --> 14:08.188
I already said more than I should.

14:08.802 --> 14:11.557
Bottom line is you start
throwing calls around right now

14:12.526 --> 14:14.619
they gonna shit blue
thinking there's a leak.

14:14.880 --> 14:16.452
They gonna come up
on the case early

14:16.464 --> 14:18.763
and we're not gonna get all
we can out of the good work

14:18.774 --> 14:19.507
we did down here.

14:19.578 --> 14:22.191
You're telling me all this
is an enforcement strategy.

14:23.752 --> 14:25.490
What the hell else could it be ?

14:26.668 --> 14:29.424
I mean, you think we'd actually
let this happen otherwise ?

14:29.931 --> 14:31.032
Come on, Banisky.

14:31.563 --> 14:33.302
I mean, look, look at this mess.

14:34.980 --> 14:36.635
Any other reporter gets on it...

14:38.530 --> 14:41.178
I give it to you and you
run with it right then.

14:41.781 --> 14:42.502
Absolutely.

14:44.156 --> 14:44.759
A week.

14:44.984 --> 14:47.019
But then I gotta run
something no matter what.

14:48.372 --> 14:49.720
<i>Purple Rain, Purple Rain.</i>

14:49.731 --> 14:50.512
It's understood.

14:54.484 --> 14:56.281
So, Brother, what
brought you back ?

14:57.333 --> 14:59.952
It disturbs me to leave
business unfinished.

15:01.136 --> 15:03.736
Heard you was shot before
you even got started down here.

15:04.528 --> 15:05.840
Not like you to get played.

15:06.242 --> 15:07.602
Betrayed, you mean.

15:08.335 --> 15:10.061
I am looking for the man they sent.

15:10.708 --> 15:13.380
From his accent he's homegrown,
raised on the street.

15:14.077 --> 15:16.868
Skilled, intelligent.
Late 20s, dark

15:17.577 --> 15:20.734
but with a scar
across his face like so.

15:22.653 --> 15:23.835
You down with this nigger ?

15:24.273 --> 15:24.876
I know him.

15:25.479 --> 15:26.366
Not to speak to

15:27.512 --> 15:29.202
but you can't be
anywhere near the game

15:29.226 --> 15:30.563
and not know
the motherfucker.

15:31.538 --> 15:32.720
He with Barksdale ?

15:33.548 --> 15:34.422
He with himself.

15:35.522 --> 15:37.874
'Cept for when he runnin'
with a young boy or two...

15:40.239 --> 15:42.083
10 months to the primary,
and you right now

15:42.095 --> 15:43.177
should be all about money.

15:43.189 --> 15:45.470
I know, I know,
dialing for dollars.

15:45.483 --> 15:48.367
You start this week and you don't
stop until you hit your numbers.

15:48.674 --> 15:50.731
We're gonna need a million
just for television.

15:50.755 --> 15:52.174
You really think this is doable ?

15:52.428 --> 15:54.473
The odds aren't great, but yeah...

15:55.017 --> 15:56.116
I think it can be done.

15:56.554 --> 15:59.272
As long as the thousand things
that can go wrong don't go wrong.

15:59.319 --> 16:00.337
Even for a white guy ?

16:01.129 --> 16:02.074
Even for a white guy.

16:02.560 --> 16:03.948
Speaking of which

16:04.422 --> 16:07.667
I notice a certain
monochromatic effect here.

16:08.288 --> 16:10.734
One thing we're gonna
need is black faces

16:11.362 --> 16:13.555
and we're gonna need them
in prominent positions.

16:13.697 --> 16:14.228
You're right.

16:14.571 --> 16:17.196
We've gotta start thinking about
endorsements by black leaders.

16:17.207 --> 16:19.962
Ministers, community people,
elected officials.

16:20.460 --> 16:21.766
Here comes the hard part:

16:22.085 --> 16:25.170
Splitting the black vote is the
only way to make the math work.

16:25.822 --> 16:27.724
So Tony Gray's gotta
get in the race

16:27.736 --> 16:30.632
he's gotta stay in the race and
he's gotta stay viable in the race.

16:30.739 --> 16:32.431
Guy's kind of a lightweight,
ain't he ?

16:32.442 --> 16:33.789
He's a good guy, all in all.

16:33.849 --> 16:35.623
Great, he's a good guy

16:36.024 --> 16:38.306
but we need him to siphon
votes from Royce.

16:38.447 --> 16:39.004
I dunno.

16:39.867 --> 16:40.860
This thing with Tony...

16:41.616 --> 16:43.128
it's not personal, Tommy.

16:43.495 --> 16:44.488
It's politics.

16:45.800 --> 16:46.829
Live with it or lose.

16:51.072 --> 16:51.781
<i>Hey, yo.</i>

16:51.842 --> 16:54.189
<i>That boy with the sharp nose,
he gonna, you know...</i>

16:54.200 --> 16:55.228
<i>he going to the Apollo.</i>

16:55.240 --> 16:56.045
<i>The Apollo ?</i>

16:56.150 --> 16:57.924
<i>Yeah, he gonna need two tickets.</i>

16:58.113 --> 17:00.053
<i>Damn, Tweety Bird
workin' that shit.</i>

17:00.064 --> 17:02.972
<i>Motherfucker, how many times
I gotta tell you not to use no names ?</i>

17:02.985 --> 17:05.017
<i>Oh yeah, right.
So I holler at you ?</i>

17:05.313 --> 17:06.318
<i>Yeah, a-ight.</i>

17:08.103 --> 17:09.486
Apollo, like the theater ?

17:09.521 --> 17:10.881
Like 125th Street.

17:11.094 --> 17:13.565
125 grams, one eighth of a kilo.

17:13.589 --> 17:15.133
Two tickets means twice that.

17:15.167 --> 17:17.023
Only new code so
far is Hamsterdam.

17:17.224 --> 17:18.112
Hamsterdam ?

17:18.219 --> 17:21.090
We're thinkin' it might have
something to do with the stash house.

17:21.730 --> 17:24.377
Well, I'm gonna hook up with Kima,
cash the Tweety Bird meet.

17:26.368 --> 17:28.048
You're happy with
what we're getting ?

17:28.592 --> 17:31.264
Another week of calls like this
and we'll have their network

17:31.299 --> 17:33.546
fleshed out and plenty
more phones to go up on.

17:35.551 --> 17:37.146
I need a moment with the detectives.

17:38.566 --> 17:39.039
Sure.

17:43.542 --> 17:45.399
I.I.D. picked up Prez's shooting.

17:45.505 --> 17:46.386
It's to be expected.

17:46.469 --> 17:49.011
The racial thing alone is tense
enough that they gotta react.

17:49.022 --> 17:50.690
No luck at all to that boy, huh ?

17:52.498 --> 17:53.929
For the supervisor's report

17:54.922 --> 17:56.228
I need to ask if either of you

17:56.240 --> 17:58.746
had any indication that Prez
harbored racial prejudices.

17:59.444 --> 18:02.045
Well, he harbored
some weird shit, no doubt.

18:02.340 --> 18:03.665
But I never got a racial vibe.

18:03.937 --> 18:05.438
Lieutenant, you seriously askin' ?

18:13.543 --> 18:14.524
Not to start no shit

18:14.583 --> 18:16.712
but you think Waggoner
gets shot if he's white ?

18:16.923 --> 18:19.336
Description called
for a number one male.

18:19.548 --> 18:20.495
I'm just sayin'.

18:23.698 --> 18:27.399
The good lord set sunday
mornin' aside for church-goin'.

18:27.777 --> 18:30.633
Even kenny bird and peanut,
when they was warring,

18:30.645 --> 18:32.725
had the good sense
to respect the truce.

18:33.730 --> 18:35.457
You know them
Barksdales sent a hat ?

18:37.454 --> 18:38.424
A church crown ?

18:39.177 --> 18:41.754
Walked up, rang the bell,
and set it down on her porch.

18:42.132 --> 18:43.148
'Cause they shamed.

18:46.033 --> 18:47.547
Is Miss Josephine mendin' ?

18:47.559 --> 18:49.551
She bruised up still,
but she a-ight though.

18:50.722 --> 18:51.525
But you ain't.

18:52.495 --> 18:53.934
Not until I settle this for good.

19:00.082 --> 19:02.871
Hey, yo, Butch, I want you
to go inside my bank

19:03.451 --> 19:04.284
and spread the word:

19:04.295 --> 19:06.884
Omar payin' cash money to get
at them people, ya feel me ?

19:07.417 --> 19:08.185
Save your money.

19:08.410 --> 19:10.100
Come now, Butch,
I got to do this, yo.

19:10.113 --> 19:11.531
I'm sayin' you ain't got to pay.

19:15.108 --> 19:16.444
Thomkins, up on McCulloh.

19:19.022 --> 19:20.038
What the funeral home ?

19:23.467 --> 19:26.299
You mean to tell me, all this time,
you had a scope on them clowns

19:26.310 --> 19:28.001
and you ain't let loose
a mumblin' word.

19:28.013 --> 19:29.562
Caught myself lookin' out for you.

19:30.366 --> 19:32.941
Fact of the matter is,
your chances of goin' up

19:32.942 --> 19:36.341
against that mob and comin'
back is as slim as a garter snake.

19:41.312 --> 19:42.612
I can't help that now, Butch.

19:49.309 --> 19:50.717
The fuck ?
Where's my people ?

19:51.199 --> 19:52.300
Slim Charles pulled 'em.

19:52.699 --> 19:53.532
Hired new muscle.

19:53.778 --> 19:55.621
Slim Charles ?
When the fuck did he...

19:57.961 --> 19:58.805
How's the count ?

19:59.486 --> 20:01.280
Down bad for the
third straight week.

20:01.679 --> 20:03.392
And the shelf-life
of the shit we got

20:03.496 --> 20:04.764
it ain't gonna last, String.

20:12.203 --> 20:12.859
I know.

20:13.270 --> 20:15.487
Slim said they was to stick
to you for protection.

20:22.112 --> 20:22.850
Nice shot.

20:23.367 --> 20:25.150
Dribble it back out.
Dribble it back out.

20:25.594 --> 20:26.546
Get your dribble on.

20:28.551 --> 20:29.947
Hey, yo, easy, easy.

20:30.493 --> 20:31.959
Y'all just hacking my man up.

20:32.440 --> 20:33.249
Foul machine.

20:36.358 --> 20:37.073
Nice drive.

20:41.360 --> 20:42.815
Kinda unschooled, ain't they ?

20:44.961 --> 20:47.495
Is that observation meant as
just a casual curbside fuck-you

20:47.518 --> 20:49.783
or are you lookin' to step up,
maybe help out here ?

20:51.178 --> 20:52.246
I'ma give it a try.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.390
I'm lookin' to get some
kids interested in boxin'.

20:57.396 --> 20:57.818
Boxing ?

21:00.552 --> 21:01.209
Look here.

21:02.252 --> 21:03.532
This is my time-out corner.

21:04.384 --> 21:06.683
Where I send children
who can't play nice together.

21:07.962 --> 21:10.801
Listen up, this man's
starting a boxing program.

21:10.823 --> 21:13.756
And from the looks of some of you,
signing on might be a good thing.

21:13.869 --> 21:14.736
Gonna need it.

21:14.995 --> 21:16.870
Only thing he know
how to do with his fist

21:16.882 --> 21:18.137
is wrap it around his cock.

21:18.595 --> 21:19.392
Fuck you, man.

21:19.439 --> 21:20.460
I'm gonna kick your ass.

21:20.472 --> 21:22.173
Come on, motherfucker,
you ain't shit.

21:23.764 --> 21:26.228
Yo, sit down, sit down,
come on, ease up.

21:26.239 --> 21:29.360
Sit down, sit down, come on,
man, sit down, man, sit down.

21:30.896 --> 21:31.624
My man...

21:37.512 --> 21:39.564
my man, you droppin' your right.

21:40.725 --> 21:43.154
You see, if the youngun there
was trained, he'd whip you.

21:43.271 --> 21:44.819
Look like he was the one got beat.

21:47.347 --> 21:48.930
Stand up, let me
show you something.

21:50.924 --> 21:52.555
Come on, man.
I ain't gonna hurt you.

21:54.440 --> 21:56.667
<i>Yellow Tops, Yellow Tops,
got them Yellow Tops.</i>

21:57.369 --> 21:58.237
<i>Yellow tops.</i>

21:59.680 --> 22:00.290
See that ?

22:01.193 --> 22:02.649
Alright, sit down.

22:03.316 --> 22:05.569
Look, if y'all want to learn more

22:06.554 --> 22:09.975
I got a gym down on Gilmor
in the old tire plant.

22:10.913 --> 22:11.758
You're all welcome.

22:12.755 --> 22:13.377
Alright ?

22:29.286 --> 22:30.951
I saw Tweety Bird parked up there.

22:32.112 --> 22:34.024
Now all we got to do
is wait for the re-up.

22:34.787 --> 22:37.590
I hope these fucks don't dick 'round
and make us sit here all day.

22:38.939 --> 22:40.054
What, this eatin' at you ?

22:42.340 --> 22:43.184
No, I'm good.

22:45.284 --> 22:46.457
Yeah, I can see that.

22:50.398 --> 22:52.214
Remember that woman
I was talking about ?

22:52.977 --> 22:54.209
The politician woman ?

22:54.948 --> 22:55.756
How's it going ?

22:56.344 --> 22:57.599
It ain't, it turned to shit.

23:02.266 --> 23:05.456
Feel like I don't even belong to any
world that even fucking matters.

23:06.419 --> 23:07.334
'Cause you're a cop ?

23:08.413 --> 23:09.643
Naw, it's not just that.

23:12.335 --> 23:13.800
It's like, I went to meet her once.

23:13.813 --> 23:15.619
She was in a hotel
room, the top floor.

23:15.924 --> 23:18.462
I punch the button on the elevator,
it doesn't even go there

23:18.463 --> 23:20.572
because you have to have
some fucking special key

23:20.583 --> 23:22.484
to even get to that
special fucking floor.

23:23.832 --> 23:26.917
So I go to the front desk, some
sneering fuck call upstairs

23:27.304 --> 23:28.888
gimme permission to go get laid.

23:31.626 --> 23:33.232
I listen to the shit she talks about

23:33.233 --> 23:36.165
and for the first time in my life,
I feel like a fucking doormat.

23:36.622 --> 23:38.179
Like anyone with
any smarts would

23:39.047 --> 23:41.017
do something else with
his life, you know ?

23:41.393 --> 23:42.413
Earn money or...

23:43.750 --> 23:44.454
get elected.

23:46.085 --> 23:48.610
Like I'm just a breathin'
machine for my fucking dick.

23:51.918 --> 23:52.598
I'm serious.

23:54.087 --> 23:55.930
I'm the smartest asshole
in three districts

23:55.952 --> 23:57.889
and she looks at me like
I'm some stupid fuck

23:57.911 --> 24:01.105
playing some stupid game
for stupid penny-ante stakes.

24:04.353 --> 24:05.972
She fuckin' looks through me, Kima.

24:18.004 --> 24:18.901
Stay in the car, man.

24:18.962 --> 24:20.886
But the tall man said
to stick to you like...

24:20.908 --> 24:23.525
Tall man gonna be there when
I'm stomp on your fucking head ?

24:24.344 --> 24:25.025
Stay in the car.

24:37.143 --> 24:39.652
Yo, make it short, man,
I got a meet to make.

24:39.712 --> 24:40.979
Oh, fuck the meet !

24:41.365 --> 24:43.934
You harder to get at than
my fat wife's cunt, nigger.

24:44.157 --> 24:45.760
Yeah, you high and
mighty Barksdales

24:45.761 --> 24:47.671
can afford to sit back
and play low key,

24:48.262 --> 24:50.284
But some of us gotta work
for a got-damn livin'.

24:50.307 --> 24:52.676
What you think this mess
ain't fuckin' up our business ?

24:52.688 --> 24:55.105
That mean Avon's willin' to sit
down and talk with Marlo

24:55.128 --> 24:55.996
work this shit out ?

25:00.014 --> 25:03.157
Well, if that don't happen,
String, I got you some bad news.

25:03.603 --> 25:05.433
Me and the boys had us a sit down.

25:05.738 --> 25:07.709
Got a quorum an'
took a vote that says...

25:08.389 --> 25:11.189
if y'all don't quit this war
we of a mind to shut you out.

25:11.623 --> 25:13.921
And when I say out, String,
I mean out the package.

25:14.414 --> 25:16.326
The boys don't want
to extend the good shit

25:16.349 --> 25:19.224
if it's gonna keep you and your
peoples out on them corners bangin'.

25:19.234 --> 25:21.111
What about the boy ?
What the fuck he say ?

25:21.265 --> 25:22.730
Vinson say Marlo willing to talk

25:23.505 --> 25:24.854
if he can keep his corners.

25:27.164 --> 25:29.558
Now, hear me on this,
String, we ain't no ingrates.

25:29.944 --> 25:32.501
We all recognize your
contribute to the co-op.

25:33.124 --> 25:34.426
But the feeling is this:

25:34.977 --> 25:37.394
it ain't right for you to be
at the head of our table

25:37.417 --> 25:38.872
when you can't call off your dog.

25:41.499 --> 25:43.470
Call it a crisis of leadership.

25:49.991 --> 25:50.999
You're gonna tell 'em ?

25:52.384 --> 25:52.911
Got to.

25:53.708 --> 25:55.658
Between the health care
workers, the reporter

25:55.744 --> 25:57.985
my own pissed-off troops,
it's gonna come out.

25:59.687 --> 26:01.188
Either tomorrow, or the next day.

26:01.657 --> 26:03.029
Then we should make a few arrests

26:03.698 --> 26:04.719
make it look tactical.

26:05.164 --> 26:05.861
Naw.

26:07.280 --> 26:10.226
You know what happens if we start
lockin' people up in Hamsterdam ?

26:11.374 --> 26:14.025
The whole rest of the district
goes back to being a shithole.

26:15.879 --> 26:16.295
Naw.

26:17.667 --> 26:19.556
If Rawls is gonna hand me my ass

26:20.963 --> 26:23.626
at least give me a chance
to tell the man my story first.

26:39.298 --> 26:39.872
Devonne.

26:57.131 --> 26:57.952
It needed doin'.

26:59.433 --> 27:00.629
<i>Somebody just got shot.</i>

27:05.286 --> 27:08.102
What you want I should give the
snitch that clued us to the denali.

27:08.442 --> 27:10.943
I mean we didn't
get Marlo, but still...

27:11.377 --> 27:13.148
No, he kept his end up.

27:13.264 --> 27:13.875
Go it all.

27:14.309 --> 27:16.562
Avon, I need a word, man.

27:16.691 --> 27:18.390
A-ight, get them
things out of here.

27:21.091 --> 27:21.995
Check it out, String.

27:22.558 --> 27:24.892
This shit got a kill range
of like 50 meters.

27:25.631 --> 27:28.517
Slim got this from some soldier
comin' back from wherever.

27:33.571 --> 27:34.990
I spoke to Prop Joe's people.

27:36.527 --> 27:37.935
They think we can work this out.

27:38.298 --> 27:39.049
A sit-down ?

27:39.295 --> 27:41.196
It's the perfect time
for it, man, I mean...

27:42.158 --> 27:43.721
you done represented yourself, man.

27:43.745 --> 27:45.434
Your name ringin' out
now that you done

27:45.446 --> 27:47.052
taken Marlo down
a notch or two, man.

27:47.053 --> 27:48.402
So why not quit while we ahead.

27:48.953 --> 27:50.568
Just let me get this
thing right, man

27:50.588 --> 27:52.689
then, you know, we get
back to business as usual.

27:52.708 --> 27:53.966
They gonna cut us out, Avon !

27:54.138 --> 27:56.232
Prop Joe and them niggers,
man, they took a vote.

27:56.249 --> 27:57.176
They gonna cut us out.

27:57.187 --> 27:59.557
We ain't gonna have that dope,
so even if we win, we lose

27:59.581 --> 28:02.688
'cause we ain't gonna have no product
to put on those fucking corners, B.

28:02.713 --> 28:03.546
Avon, look at you.

28:03.933 --> 28:06.660
Fuckin' shooting dope without
a fucking needle right now, man

28:06.672 --> 28:09.486
getting high on a power trip,
playin' fucking soldier.

28:10.225 --> 28:12.513
Yo, you gotta sit back, man,
think about our business.

28:12.536 --> 28:13.580
What the fuck you want ?

28:20.954 --> 28:23.313
That motherfucker, he good.

28:24.672 --> 28:25.388
What happened ?

28:30.629 --> 28:33.774
You know, Avon, you gotta think about
why we got in this game for, man.

28:35.087 --> 28:35.861
Was it the rep ?

28:37.070 --> 28:38.520
Was it so our names could ring out

28:38.544 --> 28:40.499
on some fucking ghetto
street corners, man ?

28:40.526 --> 28:43.117
Naw, man, there's games
beyond the fucking game.

28:44.743 --> 28:47.676
Avon, look, you and me,
we brothers, B.

28:48.040 --> 28:50.238
We ain't think we make it
this fucking far, but fuck

28:50.250 --> 28:51.410
if we ain't standing here

28:51.411 --> 28:53.318
right now, with the
whole world at our feet.

28:54.239 --> 28:56.355
The whole world, man,
not these fucking corners.

28:56.942 --> 28:57.950
The whole world, B.

28:59.499 --> 29:00.929
You know what Slim just told me ?

29:03.311 --> 29:04.601
Devonne come up dead.

29:07.706 --> 29:09.793
She was shot one in the
mouth, one in each tit.

29:13.441 --> 29:15.177
You still want to
talk truce, String ?

29:18.651 --> 29:20.984
You right when you say I need
to learn more discipline.

29:21.513 --> 29:22.146
But this...

29:23.718 --> 29:24.832
you could do this better...

29:25.230 --> 29:26.780
You're the perfect bait, Lamar.

29:27.220 --> 29:28.510
They'll see you as conflicted.

29:29.107 --> 29:30.785
Your homophobia is so visceral.

29:31.746 --> 29:32.544
You see that ?

29:32.884 --> 29:34.702
I ain't even stepped
inside the joint yet

29:34.726 --> 29:36.544
and you callin' me
a cocksucker already.

30:05.339 --> 30:06.384
You in the right place ?

30:07.956 --> 30:09.680
I'm lookin' for someone name Omar.

30:10.404 --> 30:13.113
No last name.
Scar across his face an' shit.

30:13.594 --> 30:14.686
Scarface named Omar.

30:15.166 --> 30:17.441
Sounds different,
but I can't help you.

30:17.665 --> 30:18.310
You drinking ?

30:25.241 --> 30:26.848
Maybe you wait four years.

30:28.151 --> 30:30.273
No, it has to be now.

30:32.163 --> 30:34.579
It's gotta be a three-way
and Tony's gonna go this time.

30:38.110 --> 30:38.720
I'm just...

30:40.949 --> 30:42.903
Tony's my oldest
friend on the council.

30:44.756 --> 30:46.528
Well, couldn't you
go talk to him first ?

30:47.560 --> 30:48.509
Put it on the table ?

30:49.025 --> 30:50.761
You know, may
the best man win...

30:51.149 --> 30:52.063
Truth is...

30:54.368 --> 30:56.221
he can't win alone
against Royce, either.

30:58.484 --> 31:00.677
He's got the bumper stickers,
but not much else.

31:02.085 --> 31:03.455
Wants to run on education.

31:05.026 --> 31:05.695
I mean...

31:07.407 --> 31:08.650
where do you go with that ?

31:10.680 --> 31:13.577
If I level with Tony and he
gets out, then I can't win.

31:15.243 --> 31:16.533
I need him in the race.

31:23.923 --> 31:24.873
I feel like shit.

31:26.270 --> 31:26.997
I really do.

31:55.226 --> 31:56.458
Don't look like much.

31:59.427 --> 32:01.151
This some weak ass
shit right here.

32:01.163 --> 32:01.702
Hells yeah.

32:01.714 --> 32:04.271
Man, we got lockers,
you got gear.

32:04.459 --> 32:05.656
It's all peelin' and shit.

32:06.112 --> 32:06.746
Go long.

32:08.768 --> 32:09.602
Pass it here.

32:14.551 --> 32:16.181
You gettin' me all dirty and shit.

32:16.369 --> 32:17.632
What's wrong with you ?

32:17.668 --> 32:19.204
Fuck you, bitch.

32:20.308 --> 32:23.105
We clocked the meet with Tweety Bird,
stayed on him overnight,

32:23.128 --> 32:26.348
tracked him to a possible stash house
and then home to nest in Woodlawn.

32:26.377 --> 32:27.856
Got photos, his tags...

32:30.755 --> 32:31.471
What happened ?

32:31.752 --> 32:33.137
They ditched their phones.

32:33.442 --> 32:37.043
The D.N.R.S and the wire all
died around three o'clock.

32:37.406 --> 32:39.623
We were on line just shy 30 hours.

32:41.898 --> 32:44.444
I thought we had them on their
burners for a couple of weeks.

32:44.467 --> 32:46.978
Not anymore, it's a week at best.

32:47.387 --> 32:51.048
We just spent $9,000 and
change for 18 intercepts.

32:51.834 --> 32:53.067
Five of them non-pertinent.

32:54.990 --> 32:57.161
That's close to $700 per drug call.

32:57.666 --> 32:59.084
Until we see which way this goes

32:59.109 --> 33:01.278
shouldn't we get back
on Bernard and his girl ?

33:01.325 --> 33:03.284
I mean, get a line on
the new phones at least.

33:03.355 --> 33:06.493
But that'll only give us
what we just had: 30 hours.

33:08.969 --> 33:10.927
Anyway to get ourselves
ahead of the curve ?

33:12.382 --> 33:15.326
If there were some way
to pre-wiretap the burners...

33:15.417 --> 33:16.062
What then ?

33:16.812 --> 33:18.572
Stick 'em on the rack
at Baba whatever's

33:18.607 --> 33:20.437
and wait for Bernard
to show up that day ?

33:20.461 --> 33:22.009
The problem is the wireless people.

33:22.560 --> 33:24.452
They claim it takes
a minimum of four days

33:24.487 --> 33:26.551
to process a court order
and that's only after

33:26.552 --> 33:28.698
I had my office threatened
to go public on them.

33:28.921 --> 33:30.938
Four days to hit
a couple of keystrokes.

33:30.985 --> 33:31.631
Bullshit.

33:33.507 --> 33:34.558
What if...

33:37.830 --> 33:38.605
no way.

33:39.344 --> 33:40.551
I know what you're thinking.

33:40.563 --> 33:42.404
I just thought the
same fucking thing.

33:45.790 --> 33:46.623
Alright, look, man.

33:46.634 --> 33:48.358
You wanna take your
left foot out, man.

33:49.649 --> 33:51.642
Hey, unc's playin'
wit my man's feet.

33:51.771 --> 33:53.120
Yeah, he smellin' up my ass, too.

33:53.435 --> 33:54.924
Stop with the damn clownin', man.

33:56.073 --> 33:58.783
How you gonna learn somethin'
actin' like a damn fool ?

34:00.167 --> 34:02.830
Ain't no big mystery why
your face got tattooed.

34:02.853 --> 34:04.902
Shit, that man can't
talk to you like that.

34:04.937 --> 34:07.107
I seen his ragged ass up
the spot, copin' vials.

34:07.119 --> 34:09.007
Yeah, probably pimps his ass, too.

34:09.793 --> 34:10.966
Listen, motherfucker.

34:10.978 --> 34:12.572
Yeah, bitch, touch me.

34:13.277 --> 34:14.860
Touch a juvenile, see what happen.

34:16.632 --> 34:17.453
Let's bounce.

34:18.297 --> 34:18.976
Bitch ass.

34:19.681 --> 34:20.315
Faggot.

34:22.251 --> 34:23.014
Chump ass.

34:32.563 --> 34:33.384
Lester.

34:39.891 --> 34:41.335
First time I seen him smoking.

34:42.237 --> 34:43.036
Tough habit.

34:44.092 --> 34:46.050
And pacing like a motherfuck, too.

34:47.348 --> 34:49.400
Heavy is the head
that wears the crown.

35:39.574 --> 35:42.293
<i>Bay Wireless Connect 411.
What city and state ?</i>

35:42.398 --> 35:43.336
Baltimore, Maryland.

35:46.094 --> 35:47.490
<i>How may I help you ?</i>

35:47.513 --> 35:48.556
Baltimore police.

35:50.377 --> 35:51.585
<i>Any particular department ?</i>

35:52.161 --> 35:53.568
Western District police.

35:55.422 --> 35:56.630
<i>Is this mergency ?</i>

35:58.307 --> 35:59.268
Non-emergency.

36:00.465 --> 36:02.987
Man, they just did you
with the bum rush.

36:03.608 --> 36:04.723
That's what they do.

36:05.579 --> 36:08.055
They past expert at pluckin' nerves.

36:09.567 --> 36:11.784
You just gotta remember,
they barely house broke.

36:11.843 --> 36:13.855
I'm tellin' you, man,
you wouldn't believe it.

36:13.949 --> 36:16.459
They was all wild and shit.
Wouldn't listen.

36:17.128 --> 36:19.075
Andre, I want you to crowd him.

36:19.238 --> 36:20.283
Yes, sir, crowd him.

36:20.365 --> 36:20.999
Alright.

36:29.699 --> 36:30.356
Time !

36:33.009 --> 36:35.437
You gotta set your
mind to stick with it.

36:37.747 --> 36:41.137
When those two stumbled in here,
they was wilder than wild.

36:41.220 --> 36:42.510
Now they comin' everyday.

36:43.237 --> 36:44.794
Yes, sir, no, sir.

36:46.120 --> 36:47.000
Still pretty rough

36:47.011 --> 36:49.404
but you know with the right
breaks, they gonna make it.

36:49.487 --> 36:50.085
How ?

36:50.577 --> 36:53.662
Try as they might,
I don't let 'em fail.

36:55.215 --> 36:57.550
You do that, it messes
with their mind.

36:58.382 --> 37:01.174
Pretty soon, they run out
of their little bag of tricks.

37:05.033 --> 37:06.090
What you think of that ?

37:10.008 --> 37:10.735
Pretty weak.

37:11.216 --> 37:11.862
Ain't weak.

37:13.117 --> 37:14.359
That's the startin' point...

37:21.544 --> 37:23.772
Naw, naw, I can't
put a name on him

37:24.418 --> 37:25.356
but I seen him 'round.

37:25.505 --> 37:26.854
He's off a west side.

37:27.312 --> 37:30.092
He ain't no drug dealer,
less he doin' it on the Q.T.

37:31.171 --> 37:32.602
You can't go at him, game him ?

37:33.177 --> 37:35.511
I don't know, Kima,
I mean, it be pressin'.

37:36.379 --> 37:37.347
What about her ?

37:37.687 --> 37:38.237
Squeak.

37:39.200 --> 37:40.055
Offa Lanvale.

37:41.710 --> 37:44.232
Yeah, she used to boost
for Turtle Wells', old mob.

37:44.748 --> 37:46.238
She lost a little bit of weight too.

37:46.249 --> 37:48.208
I mean, lookin' a lot
better than I remember

37:48.395 --> 37:50.073
and I remember a lot
about that girl.

37:51.036 --> 37:53.850
Damn, Bubs, is there anybody
westside you don't know ?

37:54.648 --> 37:56.056
Jus' citizens an' shit.

37:59.246 --> 38:00.675
My C.I. knows the girl.

38:00.990 --> 38:01.812
He can work her ?

38:01.999 --> 38:02.973
If it's smooth, yeah.

38:03.771 --> 38:04.311
Check this.

38:09.892 --> 38:11.014
That's Western District ?

38:11.652 --> 38:13.060
Stringer's calling the Western ?

38:13.271 --> 38:14.667
Maybe he's surrendering.

38:15.453 --> 38:18.270
After all the work we've done,
I'd never forgive the sonofabitch.

38:22.759 --> 38:24.330
Go down. Go down and out.

38:29.667 --> 38:30.313
Sweet !

38:30.583 --> 38:31.474
I got hands.

38:38.347 --> 38:40.190
What's up ?
My knuckleheads didn't post ?

38:40.470 --> 38:42.453
They did, but they left.

38:45.186 --> 38:45.878
Over here.

38:51.121 --> 38:52.787
You lookin' for
a discount, old man ?

38:53.463 --> 38:54.928
Naw, but I'm lookin' for you.

38:55.538 --> 38:56.912
Why somethin' come up missin' ?

38:57.415 --> 38:59.163
Came past to apologize.

38:59.632 --> 39:01.310
I'm new at this coachin' thin'.

39:01.321 --> 39:03.421
An' I got us off on the wrong foot.

39:04.008 --> 39:07.723
I ain't gonna leave it between us,
you thinkin' I gave up on y'all.

39:08.323 --> 39:11.537
Motherfucker's memory weak as shit.
We the ones bailed out on him.

39:14.329 --> 39:16.238
Anyway, I'm here now.

39:21.996 --> 39:22.919
Let me understand:

39:22.954 --> 39:25.581
You want to sell drug traffickers
a series of cell phones

39:25.582 --> 39:27.893
that are pre-approved
for telephonic intercepts.

39:28.644 --> 39:29.828
And you want me

39:30.368 --> 39:33.384
to sign off on court-ordered taps
on a bunch of phones that

39:33.403 --> 39:34.928
at the time I am signing the order

39:34.986 --> 39:38.282
have not been used for any
illegal activity whatsoever.

39:38.822 --> 39:40.754
If you're looking for
precedents, your honor ?

39:40.777 --> 39:41.540
There aren't any.

39:41.563 --> 39:44.320
It's circumstantial P.C. at best.

39:49.645 --> 39:50.866
What the hell, let's do it.

39:51.698 --> 39:55.287
Let the court of appeals sort it
out, if it even gets that far.

40:05.326 --> 40:06.322
Quite the legal mind.

40:33.111 --> 40:33.933
Buy you a drink ?

40:34.707 --> 40:36.349
Why the fuck
you comin' up behind me ?

40:36.901 --> 40:37.557
Sorry.

40:57.084 --> 40:57.763
Bushy Top.

40:58.257 --> 41:00.602
You called, I didn't know if
I'd find you here so late.

41:00.614 --> 41:02.432
Just getting ready
for COMSTAT tomorrow.

41:02.655 --> 41:03.675
So what's up, Major ?

41:08.221 --> 41:09.770
Your unit is still working...

41:10.626 --> 41:11.834
a drug war, right ?

41:11.869 --> 41:12.913
Working it hard.

41:13.969 --> 41:17.258
Does the name Avon Barksdale
do anythin' for you ?

41:18.224 --> 41:19.068
He's a player ?

41:19.184 --> 41:20.111
He's the main guy.

41:20.523 --> 41:22.892
We thought he was down,
but he popped up in september.

41:23.385 --> 41:25.386
You add him to the equation,
it goes a long way

41:25.411 --> 41:26.641
to explaining the violence.

41:28.109 --> 41:30.032
So it wouldn't be
a stretch if he got shot ?

41:30.219 --> 41:31.216
You heard he got shot ?

41:32.471 --> 41:34.580
You know when or where ?
I could run it out quick.

41:34.614 --> 41:36.057
Naw, ain't gonna make no difference

41:36.070 --> 41:38.556
he didn't post up at an
emergency room from what I hear.

41:41.582 --> 41:44.804
Major, I'm gonna be straight with you.
We're runnin' wires into his people

41:45.684 --> 41:47.209
but we're barely
above the street.

41:47.232 --> 41:49.227
So far, we haven't even
put an eyeball on him.

41:54.870 --> 41:56.430
Suppose to be layin' his head there.

41:57.638 --> 42:00.348
I need you to check that out,
get back to me as soon as you can.

42:00.372 --> 42:01.426
You got a C.I., huh ?

42:01.627 --> 42:03.748
You wanna see if your
man's creds are bonafide.

42:04.967 --> 42:06.435
Don't try to play me, Bushy Top.

42:07.103 --> 42:08.932
I didn't say male,
I didn't say female.

42:10.058 --> 42:10.516
Alright.

42:11.197 --> 42:12.991
I'll get a surveillance
goin' right away.

42:13.062 --> 42:15.755
According to my source,
Barksdale's name is on the paperwork.

42:15.860 --> 42:16.563
No shit.

42:18.840 --> 42:21.350
You get the confirmation on
that, call me back on my cell.

42:24.540 --> 42:26.147
Good luck tomorrow.

42:26.323 --> 42:26.957
Yeah, right.

42:57.213 --> 42:57.892
Sham.

43:00.662 --> 43:01.447
Shamrock.

43:03.499 --> 43:05.165
Run these over to Levy for me.

43:05.447 --> 43:06.773
Tell him I want a read on it.

43:07.370 --> 43:08.180
A read ?

43:08.990 --> 43:09.787
Fresh eyes.

43:10.878 --> 43:12.309
Tell him I'll call him tomorrow.

43:12.814 --> 43:13.306
A-ight.

43:20.550 --> 43:21.899
Come on, Mr. Bodyguard.

43:52.230 --> 43:54.095
And so, we're gonna
come at her like that.

43:54.553 --> 43:56.559
So you gonna give me
these phones to sell ?

43:57.157 --> 43:58.716
The money comes back, Bubs.

43:59.010 --> 43:59.585
All of it ?

44:04.857 --> 44:06.746
- Is that Beadie Russell ?
- Looks like.

44:09.713 --> 44:11.708
Whoa, yo, you can't
turn from this lane.

44:17.583 --> 44:18.932
Sweet Beatrice Russ...

44:23.324 --> 44:24.521
I was just gonna say, "hey."

44:30.679 --> 44:31.664
North and Pulaski.

44:32.568 --> 44:35.761
The photo was taken at four P.M.,
prime time for street-level dealing.

44:38.072 --> 44:39.749
That is Riggs and Calhoun.

44:41.145 --> 44:42.248
Mount and Fayette.

44:43.116 --> 44:44.088
Edmondson and Brice.

44:44.711 --> 44:46.073
It's your old foot post, Deputy.

44:47.058 --> 44:48.418
I know where it is, Major...

44:49.521 --> 44:52.442
what I don't know and
very much want to know is

44:52.852 --> 44:54.741
where is the west
Baltimore drug trade ?

44:55.421 --> 44:59.323
I hope, major, these are not staged
photographs you're showing us.

44:59.347 --> 45:00.802
No, sir, they are not.

45:01.985 --> 45:04.109
No, Deputy, I found another approach.

45:04.567 --> 45:05.704
I'm all ears, Bunny.

45:06.667 --> 45:07.864
I moved them off the corners.

45:07.924 --> 45:11.219
Goddamnit, don't be coy
with me, Major. I can see that.

45:11.946 --> 45:14.609
What I want to know is how the
fuck you managed to move them

45:14.844 --> 45:16.275
and where the fuck they are now.

45:18.128 --> 45:18.762
Deputy

45:21.072 --> 45:23.184
I don't know quite
how to put this, but we...

45:24.721 --> 45:25.565
I mean, I...

45:27.383 --> 45:29.842
I began by identifying those
areas of my district where

45:29.843 --> 45:31.822
drug trafficking was least harmful

45:32.071 --> 45:35.497
I proceeded to push all street-level
dealing towards those areas.

45:36.060 --> 45:37.092
Now at first

45:37.925 --> 45:41.147
dealing with the juveniles
on them corners, had little success.

45:42.050 --> 45:43.869
But ultimately

45:44.666 --> 45:48.081
by rounding up all the mid-level
dealers in my district

45:48.853 --> 45:50.776
and making an offer
they couldn't refuse

45:50.859 --> 45:52.794
- I was able to...
- You made them an offer ?

45:53.662 --> 45:54.260
Yes, sir.

45:57.674 --> 46:02.430
Either they move their people
to one of three designated areas

46:03.310 --> 46:05.949
where drug enforcement was
not a district priority...

46:07.052 --> 46:10.008
or they face the wrath of every
able-bodied soul in my district.

46:14.199 --> 46:15.429
Major, I don't understand.

46:15.970 --> 46:17.669
The only time we can
hold a drug corner

46:17.670 --> 46:19.559
is when we assign
officers to stand there.

46:20.298 --> 46:23.473
Your slides don't suggest any
concerted deployment on any corners.

46:24.246 --> 46:25.501
How were you able to...

46:25.525 --> 46:28.293
Jesus christ, you nit,
don't you see what he's done.

46:29.360 --> 46:30.652
He's legalized drugs !

46:31.891 --> 46:34.155
Actually, I elected to ignore them.

46:34.801 --> 46:37.440
You lost your fucking mind.
He's lost his fucking mind.

46:38.672 --> 46:42.038
You. In my office. Now !

46:44.988 --> 46:46.149
That's it, gentleman.

47:12.930 --> 47:13.634
She's a go.

47:14.279 --> 47:15.230
Showtime, Bubs.

47:28.585 --> 47:29.758
Oh, shit.

47:30.908 --> 47:31.975
Sister Squeak.

47:32.280 --> 47:33.172
Bottom-end Bubbles.

47:33.852 --> 47:34.813
How you stand, girl ?

47:35.013 --> 47:35.905
Been a long time.

47:36.501 --> 47:37.428
T-shirts ?

47:37.603 --> 47:39.527
<i>What the hell kinda
money is in t-shirts ?</i>

47:39.843 --> 47:41.098
<i>Girl, you just don't know.</i>

47:41.275 --> 47:42.242
<i>But how's your game ?</i>

47:42.278 --> 47:43.426
<i>I heard you was locked up.</i>

47:43.438 --> 47:45.206
<i>Shit, I been on paper for a year.</i>

47:45.440 --> 47:47.459
<i>- I got some things going.
- I can see that.</i>

47:47.834 --> 47:48.701
<i>You look good.</i>

47:48.726 --> 47:49.476
How's he doing ?

47:49.887 --> 47:51.341
He'd talk a cat off a fish cart.

47:51.658 --> 47:53.042
<i>A-ight, Bubs, I gotta get.</i>

47:53.501 --> 47:54.839
Alright, I see you later on.

47:58.323 --> 47:59.214
Yo, Squeak, Squeak.

47:59.894 --> 48:00.774
I 'bout forgot.

48:01.513 --> 48:03.356
I can sell you one
of these, real cheap.

48:03.366 --> 48:04.711
If you got use for the shits...

48:08.418 --> 48:10.025
I'm fuckin' dead.

48:10.682 --> 48:12.207
You mean, we're fuckin' dead.

48:12.360 --> 48:13.802
We're all dead behind this shit.

48:14.753 --> 48:16.008
Jesus christ.

48:16.946 --> 48:19.034
What I did, I did knowingly
and on my own.

48:20.266 --> 48:22.095
My men had nothin' to do with this.

48:22.458 --> 48:24.605
They thought it was part
of some elaborate trap.

48:25.775 --> 48:28.672
So if you need me to fall on
that sword, I'm good with that.

48:29.587 --> 48:30.644
You're good with it ?

48:31.042 --> 48:34.984
Hey, you know I got my vacation time,
my last 30 in a couple months.

48:35.828 --> 48:37.529
So, if you need me
to fall, I'm ready.

48:39.101 --> 48:40.930
But don't let me hear
that you're taking

48:40.931 --> 48:42.668
any punitive action
against my people.

48:43.406 --> 48:44.801
Because I can get on the soapbox

48:44.802 --> 48:47.499
and I can lie as good as
the next man, if I have to.

48:48.812 --> 48:50.466
Are you threatening me ?

48:52.965 --> 48:54.126
I believe I am, sir.

48:55.767 --> 48:56.623
My apologies.

48:58.406 --> 49:01.502
Bunny, you cocksucker, I got
give it to you, a brilliant idea.

49:01.843 --> 49:05.538
Insane and illegal, but stone
fuckin' brilliant nonetheless.

49:07.424 --> 49:08.725
After all my puttin' my foot up

49:08.726 --> 49:11.013
people's asses to decrease
the numbers, he comes in

49:11.471 --> 49:15.612
and in one stroke, gets
a fuckin' 14% decrease.

49:16.538 --> 49:19.683
Fuckin' shame it's gonna
end our careers, but still.

49:21.818 --> 49:24.164
You're all probably tired
of hearin' from me, but...

49:29.290 --> 49:30.228
I brought these.

49:31.354 --> 49:32.175
Letters...

49:32.961 --> 49:36.598
from community associations,
ministers, business people, citizens.

49:38.392 --> 49:39.514
And they're all positive.

49:40.968 --> 49:43.419
They're all happy that the
dealers are off the corners.

49:44.486 --> 49:47.127
You think that's
gonna save our asses ?

49:48.534 --> 49:49.108
Do you ?

49:50.359 --> 49:51.885
No, I guess not, but...

49:53.491 --> 49:55.052
that and my badge is all I got.

49:55.297 --> 49:59.356
I might have your badge,
Major, but not today.

50:00.048 --> 50:03.707
I don't want to draw any attention
to this shit before we're...

50:04.176 --> 50:05.491
ready to speak to it.

50:06.746 --> 50:10.686
So if you have any vacation
time, you're taking it now.

50:11.506 --> 50:16.021
Do not report for
a shift until notified.

50:27.272 --> 50:28.011
Oh...

50:30.028 --> 50:31.190
one more thing, sir.

50:32.373 --> 50:34.832
A "Sun" reporter is
aware of my deployment.

50:36.144 --> 50:37.939
I told him an investigation
was pending

50:38.925 --> 50:40.344
he promised to delay the article.

50:41.400 --> 50:41.904
How long ?

50:42.901 --> 50:45.306
About a week, tops.

50:51.425 --> 50:54.267
I was with Superstroke on the
pool circuit in the early days.

50:54.466 --> 50:56.625
But mostly pickpocketin'
and short cons.

50:57.364 --> 51:00.871
I did the long distance access card
heist before cell phones got popular.

51:01.399 --> 51:02.267
You crept numbers ?

51:03.358 --> 51:05.438
Yeah, I favored the airports, yeah.

51:05.790 --> 51:07.004
Can you still read numbers ?

51:07.420 --> 51:08.312
What's up with this ?

51:08.334 --> 51:10.411
Your man thinkin' I brought
him bad merchandise ?

51:10.423 --> 51:12.839
'Cause if that what he think,
we can beat feet right now.

51:12.848 --> 51:15.394
Damn, Bernard, why you
actin' all C.I.A. and shit ?

51:15.440 --> 51:16.883
We tryin' to make money here.

51:16.953 --> 51:18.642
If you had to answer
to the people I do

51:18.666 --> 51:20.670
your ass would be damn
more sight cautious, too.

51:20.683 --> 51:21.586
That's all I'm sayin'.

51:21.610 --> 51:22.501
I appreciate caution.

51:23.130 --> 51:24.642
'Cause I'm hangin' out here too.

51:26.038 --> 51:26.753
Give it a go.

51:27.481 --> 51:28.255
Use a cell phone.

51:39.244 --> 51:41.378
Marlene, you send
that copy off to Paris ?

51:42.505 --> 51:43.396
Thank you, darling.

51:44.522 --> 51:46.040
That will work, I'm at the airport.

51:46.531 --> 51:47.506
The shuttle, yes...

52:06.486 --> 52:15.084
three, one, oh, double four, eight,
sixteen, ninety-one, double seven

52:15.448 --> 52:20.477
eight, three, one, two.
Now that last number might be a seven.

52:20.512 --> 52:23.093
I'm not too sure with
these small keypads and all.

52:23.691 --> 52:24.735
We can do business.

52:28.752 --> 52:29.315
That's it.

52:30.054 --> 52:32.388
One two, one two, one two.

52:33.549 --> 52:34.557
One two, that's it.

52:35.297 --> 52:36.541
One two, there you go.

52:37.591 --> 52:39.879
Alright, there it is.
Now you gettin' it.

52:40.477 --> 52:41.603
Keep that left hand up.

52:45.252 --> 52:45.838
Hey.

52:46.530 --> 52:46.977
Hey.

52:48.685 --> 52:49.331
Alright.

52:49.554 --> 52:50.797
Watch your balance now.

52:50.961 --> 52:51.829
Don't lean forward.

52:51.830 --> 52:54.050
Don't lean too much, don't
lean too forward, alright ?

52:54.071 --> 52:56.463
Alright, let's go. Don't lean
too forward, that's right.

52:56.744 --> 52:57.859
One two, pivot...

52:58.128 --> 52:58.934
You're kidding.

52:59.955 --> 53:01.773
Tell me he's kidding.

53:03.520 --> 53:04.599
You're kidding, right ?

53:05.773 --> 53:08.494
He did it without our knowledge.

53:08.635 --> 53:09.858
Without your knowledge.

53:10.515 --> 53:12.685
Well, that's worse.
You're the Commissioner...

53:13.201 --> 53:14.526
Was the Commissioner.

53:15.593 --> 53:18.538
You think the buck's gonna stop
in this office, you're wrong.

53:18.913 --> 53:23.919
If I might, these are letters
from people in his district.

53:24.764 --> 53:27.462
Ministers, business
people, voters...

53:28.270 --> 53:29.490
all glowing reports.

53:30.241 --> 53:34.440
And there's the 14% reduction
in crime, in the Western.

53:35.402 --> 53:37.220
That's not an anomaly.

53:38.030 --> 53:39.261
It's hard data.

53:40.505 --> 53:42.926
Now, we can clean it up,
make it go away.

53:43.853 --> 53:45.589
The press might already
have wind of it

53:45.600 --> 53:49.495
but we can explain that as
some sort of a new initiative.

53:50.351 --> 53:52.111
Trap high-end drug dealers...

53:53.651 --> 53:54.461
14% ?

53:55.669 --> 53:59.809
If we handle this right, we
might all get out from underneath.

54:00.419 --> 54:01.662
No mud on anybody.

54:04.644 --> 54:06.134
No, no.

54:07.883 --> 54:10.264
I trusted you, Erv, I really did.

54:10.756 --> 54:11.882
You let me down.

54:12.715 --> 54:14.841
Now, this thing goes wrong,
no tellin' the damage.

54:14.864 --> 54:16.353
On this, you walk point.

54:16.553 --> 54:19.157
That's the way things work, Erv.
You know it as well as I do.

54:26.263 --> 54:27.037
Thank you, Ervin.

54:28.808 --> 54:30.849
I'll be over shortly
to see the detailed plan

54:30.871 --> 54:33.019
on how this shit gets
cleaned up immediately.

54:50.612 --> 54:53.579
If you could call this shit
something other than what it is...

54:53.732 --> 54:54.916
Don't even think it.

55:01.244 --> 55:02.464
Way it works is this:

55:02.781 --> 55:06.124
If you don't re-up the minutes
on your cell phone before 60 days

55:06.312 --> 55:08.361
the wireless company
recycles the phone number.

55:08.408 --> 55:09.734
And that's where I get them.

55:10.215 --> 55:13.053
I put the word out on the street
that I'm buying tossed-off burners.

55:13.065 --> 55:14.308
Payin' two dollars a pop.

55:14.566 --> 55:16.290
Street people bring me hundreds.

55:16.666 --> 55:19.150
I bring 'em in here to my niece
she jiggles the computer

55:19.162 --> 55:22.164
juices them up another 200
minutes on a bogus account.

55:22.740 --> 55:27.008
And that automatically extends the
life of the phone for another 60 days.

55:27.571 --> 55:29.957
She charges me 20
on each phone on her end.

55:30.298 --> 55:32.607
I double it or more
on the street to make mine.

55:33.335 --> 55:34.403
So what you sayin' ?

55:35.481 --> 55:37.554
Baby, a standard
Trac phone, with two

55:37.566 --> 55:40.405
maybe 400 minutes on it
gonna run you 150, 200, easy.

55:41.260 --> 55:45.131
I charge you an even 100,
you clear 50 on each phone.

55:45.237 --> 55:47.315
That's if'in you can back
them up with receipts.

55:47.421 --> 55:49.955
I gotta show receipts lookin'
like they from different places

55:49.978 --> 55:50.705
or I can't play.

55:52.594 --> 55:54.119
Can we accommodate the good man ?

55:54.705 --> 55:56.769
Damn, Calvin, you know
I got the bingo tonight.

56:09.631 --> 56:11.978
Look, friend, I ain't sure
you want to be around here.

56:12.153 --> 56:14.382
And I'm damn sure we're
gettin' tired of havin' you.

56:14.406 --> 56:15.298
That plain enough ?

56:15.320 --> 56:16.305
You should know by now

56:16.329 --> 56:18.710
I don't wanna be 'round no
bunch of cocksucking faggots.

56:19.028 --> 56:21.455
But I ain't gonna stop coming
round till I run up on Omar.

56:21.561 --> 56:23.122
You might want to get the word out.

56:23.191 --> 56:25.338
For the last time,
I don't know him.

56:25.572 --> 56:27.040
Then I'm back tomorrow.

56:51.997 --> 56:52.993
Maybe I can help you ?

56:58.600 --> 56:59.949
I don't doubt it for a minute.

57:00.305 --> 57:06.374
