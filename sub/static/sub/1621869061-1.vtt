What did I tell you?

17:41.894 --> 17:43.937
Someone could have seen you!

17:44.021 --> 17:45.314
I heard something!

17:45.397 --> 17:47.566
-What did I tell you?!
-I thought it was her!

17:47.649 --> 17:49.860
I told you, she's gone!

17:50.778 --> 17:53.405
[sighs] It's my fault.
I told you not to be afraid.

17:53.489 --> 17:54.782
I thought I could trust you.

You can!

17:55.949 --> 17:57.910
No, we need to trust each other!

17:57.993 --> 18:01.413
I don't trust you. You don't tell me
everything. You think I'm too little!

18:59.429 --> 19:01.098
You mind lowering the gun?

19:03.142 --> 19:04.351
Feel better if I didn't.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.603
I'm just looking for someone.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.313
Well, they're not here.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.065
You better look someplace else.

19:12.109 --> 19:13.277
How long you been here?

19:14.778 --> 19:16.989
I realize how this looks,
but I give you my word,

19:17.072 --> 19:18.699
I had no idea your camp was here.

19:18.782 --> 19:20.325
Who said I had a camp?

19:23.120 --> 19:25.581
My sister went off in these mountains,

-It's not a place for an unarmed woman.
-Don't move.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.337
I want to know if she made it through.

19:32.421 --> 19:34.256
She didn't come through here.

19:35.632 --> 19:38.385
You should get back on the road
before it gets dark.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.723
The road's the last place
you want to be, friend.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.768
You haven't gotten out much lately, huh?

19:52.399 --> 19:53.942
[Pubba] What's it like out there?

19:56.028 --> 19:56.862
It sucks.

19:58.322 --> 20:00.199
No rules, no laws.

-People think the hybrids caused it.
-Yeah, well, maybe it caused them.

20:22.679 --> 20:23.680
[man] Yeah, maybe.

20:24.431 --> 20:26.975
Any case, ain't many of us left.

20:47.287 --> 20:49.957
I've lived here alone by myself

20:50.040 --> 20:52.751

21:20.112 --> 21:22.614
-Gus, son, get in.
-I don't wanna.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.408
I said, get in the cubby.

21:24.491 --> 21:26.285
-It's a hole.
-It's not a hole.

21:27.077 --> 21:30.956
You know how foxes hide out during the day
in their little fox house in the ground?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.418
What's the Sick?

21:34.501 --> 21:35.335
It's, uh…

21:36.461 --> 21:37.754
grownup stuff.

21:37.838 --> 21:39.673
Why'd you say you lived alone?

21:40.382 --> 21:41.300
To protect you.

21:42.217 --> 21:45.721
Sometimes it's okay to bend the truth
if it helps someone you love.

21:46.346 --> 21:47.806
Understand?

21:47.889 --> 21:49.308
[Gus] I'm scared.

21:49.391 --> 21:51.935
I know, but I promise you,

21:52.019 --> 21:54.604
if you hide in that cubby
and you be very quiet,

21:54.688 --> 21:56.815
I'll be back before the sun goes to bed.

22:08.243 --> 22:10.454
That's what you took
from that conversation?

22:10.537 --> 22:12.789
No, I said don't come out
until you hear from me.
