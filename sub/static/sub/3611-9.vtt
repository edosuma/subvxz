00:28.571 --> 00:30.357
You wanna hear something crazy?

00:31.949 --> 00:33.155
What's that?

00:33.242 --> 00:36.450
You see the big guy
when we got on in LA?

00:36.537 --> 00:39.779
Sitting in first class?
Curly hair? Guitar case?

00:40.666 --> 00:41.826
What about him?

00:41.918 --> 00:43.909
He's one of the Oceanic Six.

00:44.003 --> 00:46.540
Guy's got nerves of steel, man.

00:46.631 --> 00:49.464
He survives a full-on
commercial airliner crash,

00:49.550 --> 00:52.883
now he's back flying
over the same South Pacific?

00:52.970 --> 00:57.555
Well, maybe he doesn't believe lightning
will strike twice in the same place.

01:10.947 --> 01:13.108
You all right there, Frank?

01:13.199 --> 01:14.484
l'mjust fine.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.118
Dude, you might wanna
fasten your seat belt.

01:29.840 --> 01:30.920
Oh, no.

01:32.176 --> 01:33.256
What?

01:42.645 --> 01:44.431
Auto-pilot off!

01:44.522 --> 01:48.140
- l have the controls.
- Auto-pilot off. You have the controls.

01:54.699 --> 01:56.280
Full right rudder!

02:10.131 --> 02:11.211
What?!

02:11.299 --> 02:12.459
Sta/l.

02:12.550 --> 02:13.539
We've lost power!

02:14.927 --> 02:16.713
Restarting one.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.385
Restarting two.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.973
Altimeter reading 650!

02:22.226 --> 02:23.966
Oh, my God!

02:25.688 --> 02:27.394
Give me more power!

02:27.481 --> 02:29.267
- You're gonna rip us apart!
- Do it!

02:33.029 --> 02:34.235
Come on.

02:34.322 --> 02:36.404
Come on.

02:44.915 --> 02:46.530
Is that a runway?

02:47.710 --> 02:50.326
Massive instrument failure!
Putting her down!

02:50.421 --> 02:54.960
Mayday! Mayday! This is Ajira
316! Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

02:55.051 --> 02:56.291
Fifteen, 16...

02:56.385 --> 02:59.297
- Full flaps!
- Gear down! Airspeed 190!

03:00.931 --> 03:02.637
We're coming in too steep!

03:12.068 --> 03:13.274
Reverse thrusters!

03:16.989 --> 03:18.490
Come on!

03:18.574 --> 03:19.939
We're running out!

03:21.077 --> 03:22.692
Hold on!

03:22.787 --> 03:24.618
Brace for impact.

03:53.317 --> 03:54.306
Hey!

03:59.615 --> 04:01.025
Hey!

04:01.117 --> 04:03.449
Hey, lady, are you OK?

04:03.536 --> 04:04.651
Jarrah?

04:04.745 --> 04:07.578
No. My name is Caesar.
We had an accident.

04:07.665 --> 04:09.496
But we're OK now.

04:26.684 --> 04:27.890
Frank?

04:28.018 --> 04:30.930
Sun. You all right?

04:31.021 --> 04:33.273
Oh, my God! What happened?

04:33.357 --> 04:35.063
I don't know.

04:39.864 --> 04:41.195
Where's everyone else?

04:42.199 --> 04:44.190
Jack. Kate. Hurley.

04:45.161 --> 04:46.776
Where'd they go?

04:46.871 --> 04:48.031
They're gone.

04:52.293 --> 04:55.205
Gone? Gone where?

04:56.839 --> 04:57.954
How would I know?

05:40.883 --> 05:42.123
You're alive.

05:45.304 --> 05:47.795
Dude, I can't believe it!

05:51.477 --> 05:53.138
Easy on the ribs there, Kong.

05:53.229 --> 05:56.471
Kong. I actually missed that.

05:56.565 --> 05:58.226
Missed you too, Hugo.

05:59.235 --> 06:00.270
Sawyer.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.193
Doc.

06:12.248 --> 06:13.533
Good to see you, Kate.

06:14.625 --> 06:16.240
You too, James.

06:28.472 --> 06:32.590
Son of a bitch actually did it. Locke
said he was gonna bring you back, but...

06:33.811 --> 06:34.926
...where is he?

06:40.276 --> 06:41.686
John's dead.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.442
Dead? How?

06:50.411 --> 06:52.151
It doesn't matter. He's gone.

06:53.998 --> 06:57.286
What's up with you guys
in the old Dharma jumpsuits?

06:59.545 --> 07:00.660
You didn't tell 'em?

07:02.047 --> 07:03.503
No. l was waiting for you.

07:03.591 --> 07:05.081
Tell us what?

07:11.682 --> 07:13.513
We're in the Dharma lnitiative.

07:15.144 --> 07:17.931
- They came back to the island?
- No.

07:18.022 --> 07:19.637
We came back.

07:24.361 --> 07:26.317
It's 1977.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.942
Oh, what?

07:51.972 --> 07:54.634
So you're telling me
that you've been here,

07:54.725 --> 07:57.967
living with the Dharma Initiative
for the past three years?

07:58.062 --> 08:01.680
That's right. How long's it been
for you since the chopper?

08:01.774 --> 08:02.809
Three years.

08:02.900 --> 08:06.893
Hey, Jin, this is Miles.
Where are you? Over.

08:07.029 --> 08:09.896
lfl don't report in soon,
they'll send out a patrol.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.946
What should we do with them?

08:13.994 --> 08:15.734
Dude, your English is awesome.

08:15.871 --> 08:17.407
What we do is we bring 'em in.

08:17.539 --> 08:18.665
Bring us in where?

08:18.791 --> 08:22.875
The barracks at Dharmaville. Can't
wander in the jungle with the hostiles.

08:22.961 --> 08:24.212
"The hostiles"?

08:25.422 --> 08:26.411
The Others.

08:26.548 --> 08:29.130
What about everyone else
from the plane?

08:29.259 --> 08:30.840
Everyone else?

08:30.928 --> 08:32.418
We didn't come back alone.

08:33.806 --> 08:35.922
Sayid was on the plane, too, Lapidus...

08:38.102 --> 08:39.091
...and Sun.

08:41.980 --> 08:44.187
Jin, hold up! Where you going?

08:44.274 --> 08:48.108
The Flame. If a plane landed
on the island, Radzinsky will know.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.277
Hold on, we gotta think about this!

08:57.538 --> 09:00.826
All right, that's it.
Listen, you guys gotta stay put.

09:00.916 --> 09:02.747
Don't go nowhere, don't do nothing

09:02.835 --> 09:06.293
until I figure out how the hell
to explain where you came from.

09:07.423 --> 09:08.788
Sawyer, wait.

09:09.591 --> 09:12.333
Other than you and Jin,
who else is still here?

09:20.978 --> 09:23.594
Miles, have you seen James?

09:23.689 --> 09:27.147
Nope. He's not answering
his walkie, either.

09:28.652 --> 09:30.608
Jin called him this morning.

09:30.696 --> 09:33.654
Then he just ran off without
telling me what was going on.

09:34.742 --> 09:36.698
Well, let's see what we've got.

09:42.499 --> 09:44.205
Hang on. There he is.

09:57.681 --> 09:58.761
Hey.

09:58.849 --> 10:01.761
You seen my baggy sweatshirt,
the one with the bulldog?

10:01.852 --> 10:03.217
It's in the laundry.

10:03.312 --> 10:05.849
James. What's going on?

10:05.981 --> 10:07.721
They're back.

10:09.985 --> 10:11.270
I'm sorry, who's back?

10:12.446 --> 10:14.357
Jack, Hurley, Kate.

10:16.366 --> 10:17.697
What?

10:18.452 --> 10:20.033
I know.

10:22.206 --> 10:23.787
They came back, Juliet.

10:24.875 --> 10:27.617
- Are they here now?
- Yeah.

10:27.711 --> 10:31.704
They're off the north point,
waiting for me to tell 'em what to do.

10:33.383 --> 10:35.510
- How did they get... ?
- I'm not sure.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.380
They said they were on a plane.

10:48.899 --> 10:51.390
I don't understand it
any more than you do.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.604
But they're here.

10:53.695 --> 10:57.404
And I gotta find a way to bring
them in before someone else finds 'em

10:57.491 --> 10:59.698
and they screw up
everything we got here.

11:04.289 --> 11:07.747
There's a sub coming in this afternoon.

11:33.402 --> 11:35.893
Do you understand
the concept of knocking?!

11:45.330 --> 11:47.662
Get your hands off that!

11:48.041 --> 11:50.623
Thought you learned English!
I said hands off!

11:50.711 --> 11:54.579
Nobody handles any of the gear
in this station except me. Understand?

11:55.632 --> 11:57.372
I need to check the radar logs.

11:59.428 --> 12:00.463
For what?

12:00.554 --> 12:04.342
Please. I need to know
if a plane landed on the island.

12:04.433 --> 12:06.719
If a plane landed? Here?

12:06.810 --> 12:07.845
Yes.

12:09.187 --> 12:12.475
What, so you think
if a plane landed on our island

12:12.566 --> 12:14.852
I'd be over there
just building my model?

12:14.943 --> 12:18.856
That I wouldn't have called anyone?
That I wouldn't have put out an alert?

12:18.947 --> 12:21.734
Maybe you missed it.
Check with the other stations.

12:21.825 --> 12:24.692
ljust told you, I would not be...

12:25.954 --> 12:28.661
Check with the other stations.

12:40.344 --> 12:44.383
Attention all stations, this is a system
wide broadcast from Radzinsky.

12:44.890 --> 12:48.758
I'm checking in to see if anyone's
seen an airplane over the island.

12:48.852 --> 12:52.891
No one else has seen an airplane, but if
you have, could you call in to me? Over.

12:56.652 --> 12:59.894
So what are you all hot
and bothered about, Kwon?

13:00.030 --> 13:02.021
Why is this plane so damn important?

13:04.910 --> 13:06.650
ltjust is.

13:31.561 --> 13:33.552
Did you lose someone?

13:34.189 --> 13:35.645
Excuse me?

13:35.732 --> 13:39.520
I saw you looking around. I thought
maybe you lost someone on the plane.

13:40.237 --> 13:41.898
No.

13:43.073 --> 13:44.938
l... was traveling alone.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.274
Can I get everybody's attention?!

13:49.037 --> 13:50.447
Everybody, please!

13:54.209 --> 13:56.200
Listen up, folks.

13:56.962 --> 13:58.827
Here's where we're at.

13:58.922 --> 14:03.165
The radio is dead, so I haven't
been able to call in our situation.

14:03.260 --> 14:05.467
That's all right.
Soon as they figure out

14:05.554 --> 14:09.092
we're not where we're supposed
to be, they'll come looking for us.

14:09.641 --> 14:13.725
So best thing to do right now
is stick together,

14:13.812 --> 14:16.929
stick together, hunker down,
and wait 'til help gets here.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.764
- Where is "here"?
- What's that?

14:19.776 --> 14:21.812
Where is here? What is this place?

14:23.739 --> 14:27.323
I don't know where here is
because this island's not on my charts.

14:27.909 --> 14:28.989
Really?

14:29.536 --> 14:30.616
Really.

14:30.954 --> 14:34.617
Because there are buildings over there
and animal cages.

14:36.877 --> 14:40.495
Down at the beach, you can see
a bigger island across the water.

14:42.132 --> 14:44.339
So maybe you should get
some new charts.

14:44.426 --> 14:48.169
Right now, I'm just trying
to keep everyone here safe.

14:48.263 --> 14:50.219
So let's gather up some firewood.

14:51.016 --> 14:53.382
If he wants to wait, let him.

14:53.477 --> 14:55.342
I say we search these buildings.

14:56.897 --> 14:59.809
Maybe they have a radio
or some food.

15:01.985 --> 15:03.976
Who wants to help me?

15:40.190 --> 15:41.896
Why are you following me?

15:46.071 --> 15:47.481
Where are you going?

15:48.365 --> 15:49.855
Back to our island.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.155
You wanna come?

16:08.468 --> 16:09.674
Juliet?

16:10.637 --> 16:14.300
Hey, Amy.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

16:14.391 --> 16:16.097
No, it's fine.

16:16.184 --> 16:18.049
| just came to get the sub manifest.

16:19.146 --> 16:22.479
- I don't want you working today.
- Thank you.

16:24.568 --> 16:26.559
- Full load?
- Almost.

16:26.653 --> 16:29.486
Two of the recruits dropped out
in the eleventh hour.

16:29.573 --> 16:32.280
They didn't want
to take the sedative for the trip.

16:32.367 --> 16:33.982
Can you tell Pierre for me?

16:34.077 --> 16:35.408
Hey.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.660
Hi.

16:38.707 --> 16:40.368
Hello, little one.

16:40.458 --> 16:41.868
Hey.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.660
You and Horace decided on a name?

16:45.755 --> 16:49.213
Yeah, we have.
We're going to name him Ethan.

16:57.893 --> 17:00.726
Hey, buddy.

17:03.106 --> 17:06.098
So when are you and Jim
gonna have one of these?

17:07.068 --> 17:08.649
I don't know.

17:10.447 --> 17:12.187
The timing's gotta be right.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.537
So the woman who told you
how to come back,

17:25.629 --> 17:27.995
did she mention
that it would be 30 years ago?

17:29.674 --> 17:32.791
No. No, she left that part out.

17:35.597 --> 17:37.633
What are we supposed to do now?

17:40.810 --> 17:42.186
I'm not sure yet.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.932
Sawyer's back!

17:59.079 --> 18:02.913
Listen. Y'all are gonna be the second
batch of recruits coming off a sub

18:02.999 --> 18:05.911
pulling into port about now,
so we ain't got much time.

18:06.002 --> 18:10.462
Nice suit, Doc. Not exactly
island wear. Try this one.

18:10.548 --> 18:13.756
You want us to say we came in
on the sub? How's that gonna work?

18:13.843 --> 18:16.380
Everyone gets knocked out
before the trip.

18:16.471 --> 18:18.883
Nobody meets each other
'til we process 'em.

18:19.057 --> 18:21.799
We need to find the rest
of the people from the plane.

18:21.893 --> 18:25.602
lfthere was a plane, Jin'll find it
so we got ten minutes to make intake

18:25.689 --> 18:28.305
or you'll be camping
in the jungle for a long time.

18:28.400 --> 18:31.437
Ain't another batch
of recruits due in for six months.

18:34.489 --> 18:37.947
- What do you think?
- I think we should listen to Sawyer.

18:38.034 --> 18:39.899
| vote for not camping.

18:40.704 --> 18:43.320
Trust me. Do what I say,
everything'll be fine.

18:46.209 --> 18:47.870
Let's move.

18:54.551 --> 18:56.963
| just heard from the Looking Glass.

18:57.053 --> 19:00.716
They were the last station to check in.
Got nothing but an incoming sub.

19:03.560 --> 19:07.018
Why don't you go home
and I'll call you if something happens.

19:10.358 --> 19:12.815
Move! Move! Out of my way.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.151
Those bastards.

19:15.238 --> 19:16.273
What do you see?

19:16.406 --> 19:18.647
Grid 325.
Motion sensor alarm was tripped.

19:18.742 --> 19:21.108
We've got a hostile
inside the perimeter.

19:22.954 --> 19:24.569
Hey! Where are you going?!

19:57.781 --> 19:59.396
Stop right there!

20:08.416 --> 20:09.531
Sayid?

20:10.794 --> 20:12.125
Jin.

20:13.963 --> 20:15.373
Where is Sun?

20:17.133 --> 20:18.714
I don't know.

20:19.761 --> 20:20.750
Shut up!

20:24.140 --> 20:25.300
Get down!

20:26.434 --> 20:28.425
Say another word and you are dead!

20:40.698 --> 20:44.737
- OK, so it's 1977.
- Yep.

20:44.828 --> 20:48.491
And you guys are all members
of the Dharma lnitiative.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.034
Yep.

20:53.503 --> 20:56.119
You do realize those dudes
get wiped out, right?

20:57.048 --> 20:59.380
I saw the pit
where the bodies got dumped.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.583
- What about it?
- Aren't you gonna warn them?

21:01.678 --> 21:03.839
Aren't you gonna stop it from happening?

21:03.930 --> 21:06.922
I ain't here to play Nostradamus
to these people.

21:07.016 --> 21:10.759
Faraday's got interesting theories
on what we can and can't do here.

21:10.854 --> 21:13.345
Did you say Faraday? He's here?

21:15.692 --> 21:17.432
Not anymore.

21:26.453 --> 21:31.493
Welcome, new recruits. We '/I be going
inside the processing station,

21:31.583 --> 21:34.666
where you'll be given
your work assignment and lodging.

21:47.891 --> 21:51.975
Put these on. Juliet's got it worked out
so your names will be on the list.

21:52.061 --> 21:54.598
When you get in,
watch the meet-and-greet video

21:54.689 --> 21:56.475
and wait for 'em to call your name.

21:56.566 --> 22:00.104
When they do, smile and take
yourjumpsuits and work assignments.

22:00.195 --> 22:02.402
- Work assignments?
- I got it covered.

22:02.489 --> 22:04.980
Act doped up because
you just woke up from the sub.

22:05.074 --> 22:09.238
What if they ask us questions we can't
answer? "Who's the President in 1977?"

22:09.329 --> 22:11.866
It's not a damn game show, Hugo.

22:11.956 --> 22:14.538
Besides, I'm gonna be in there
to get your backs.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.038
Let's move.

22:34.812 --> 22:38.771
LaFleur, where've you been? I've been
trying to reach you on the walkie.

22:42.111 --> 22:44.022
What the hell are they doing here?

22:44.113 --> 22:45.819
They're our new inductees.

22:45.907 --> 22:50.651
I'll explain later. Stop staring
and tell me what your damn problem is.

22:50.745 --> 22:52.451
lt's... it's Jin.

22:53.122 --> 22:54.623
There's a 14-J at the Flame.

22:54.749 --> 22:55.864
What?

22:57.210 --> 22:58.746
Jin, you there?

22:59.879 --> 23:02.461
James, we have a problem.
We found a hostile.

23:02.549 --> 23:04.631
What do you mean? Where?

23:06.594 --> 23:10.007
He was wandering in the jungle.
Radzinsky's taking care of him.

23:10.098 --> 23:12.965
What was he doing in our territory?
Violation of the truce.

23:17.146 --> 23:18.181
lt's Sayid.

23:18.273 --> 23:20.059
What?

23:20.149 --> 23:22.140
Son of a bitch.

23:22.694 --> 23:24.059
Was anyone else with him?

23:24.153 --> 23:26.144
No, he was alone.

23:38.418 --> 23:39.498
Wait!

23:40.670 --> 23:43.002
Waiting doesn't interest me
much right now.

23:43.089 --> 23:46.081
There are three outriggers near here.
I'm gonna take one.

23:46.175 --> 23:48.257
So you can come along
and help me row...

23:49.429 --> 23:50.714
...or you can stay here.

23:51.681 --> 23:54.297
Frankly, it makes no difference to me.

23:54.392 --> 23:56.974
- Why are you leaving?
- Why are you staying?

23:58.354 --> 23:59.969
The main island...

24:01.357 --> 24:02.938
Is that where Jin is?

24:04.944 --> 24:06.445
Honestly? I don't know.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.362
But that's where I'd start looking.

24:11.534 --> 24:12.694
Sun!

24:13.578 --> 24:14.909
Over here!

24:19.042 --> 24:20.157
Hello, Frank.

24:21.836 --> 24:23.121
You all right?

24:23.212 --> 24:24.713
Yes, I'm fine.

24:25.590 --> 24:29.378
I got worried when I couldn't find you
and I saw him leaving.

24:30.136 --> 24:31.967
What are you doing out here?

24:36.559 --> 24:38.595
Ben knows where there's a boat.

24:39.520 --> 24:42.387
I'm going back
to the main island with him.

24:45.401 --> 24:48.609
You don't think you can
really trust this guy, do you?

24:55.203 --> 24:56.818
l have to trust him.

25:18.226 --> 25:20.182
- You ready?
- Yes.

25:20.269 --> 25:21.349
Sun.

25:21.938 --> 25:24.930
I want you to think about this.
This guy is dangerous.

25:26.609 --> 25:27.940
That boat I came here on

25:28.027 --> 25:31.565
was filled with commandos
whose only mission was to get him.

25:31.948 --> 25:33.984
And how'd that work out for everyone?

25:37.787 --> 25:39.197
Don't do it.

25:41.624 --> 25:42.659
Come with us?

25:42.750 --> 25:45.537
I can't. I've got people
I've gotta look after.

25:45.628 --> 25:50.122
That's right, Frank. A captain's first
responsibility is to his passengers.

25:50.633 --> 25:52.999
l have people
l have to take care of, too.

25:53.094 --> 25:56.211
There's a small dock a half mile
due south across the water.

25:56.305 --> 25:59.797
It leads to a town where | used to live.
There are resources there.

25:59.892 --> 26:03.885
So if anyone can help you and the rest
of the plane get out of here safely...

26:12.488 --> 26:14.228
I thought you trusted this guy.

26:15.992 --> 26:17.482
I lied.

26:19.996 --> 26:21.327
Welcome to the island.

26:21.414 --> 26:22.995
For your comfort and safety,

26:23.124 --> 26:26.867
we ask that you stay within the confines
of your new living quarters.

26:26.961 --> 26:31.500
Our barracks are surrounded
by a high frequency sonar fence

26:31.591 --> 26:35.083
to protect us from the island's
abundant and diverse wildlife.

26:35.970 --> 26:38.211
How are we gonna do this?

26:39.766 --> 26:42.257
Shephard? Jack Shephard?

26:44.187 --> 26:45.347
Here we go.

26:47.148 --> 26:49.685
Hey, Jack. Have a seat.

26:53.404 --> 26:55.144
Of course it isn't here.

26:56.032 --> 26:57.772
- What's that?
- Your file.

26:57.867 --> 27:00.825
Could they be any more
disorganized on the other side?

27:02.038 --> 27:06.702
Sorry. Namaste. l'm Pierre Chang.
Welcome to the Dharma lnitiative.

27:07.043 --> 27:08.874
How was your ride in?

27:08.961 --> 27:10.462
It was fine.

27:10.546 --> 27:14.084
Good. Who was your shuttle driver?

27:14.175 --> 27:16.006
I'm sorry?

27:16.093 --> 27:18.800
The shuttle. From the sub.
Who was your driver?

27:18.888 --> 27:20.344
Oh, that was...

27:21.933 --> 27:23.423
It was LaFleur.

27:23.518 --> 27:26.601
Ah, yes. Good man, LaFleur.
Runs a very tight operation.

27:28.356 --> 27:30.813
I'm sorry for the disorganization.

27:30.900 --> 27:34.609
The woman who is supposed to be
processing you in had a baby last night,

27:34.695 --> 27:36.401
I got pulled out of my lab.

27:37.448 --> 27:41.066
Here it is, yourjob assignment.

27:44.121 --> 27:47.579
You've been assigned to the Shed.

27:47.667 --> 27:49.828
"Workman." What does that mean?

27:49.919 --> 27:53.082
Based on your aptitude tests,
you'll do janitorial work.

28:02.598 --> 28:05.761
Hey there, ma'am.
They haven't called you yet?

28:05.852 --> 28:07.843
No, not yet.

28:07.937 --> 28:09.677
What's your name?

28:10.189 --> 28:12.771
Kate Austen.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.315
Austen.

28:15.069 --> 28:16.605
Austen.

28:23.578 --> 28:25.318
You're not on my list.

28:25.413 --> 28:29.156
You're not on the sub manifest, either.
Who was your recruiter?

28:32.920 --> 28:34.376
Hold on, Phil.

28:34.463 --> 28:36.454
| just got the new list from Amy.

28:36.549 --> 28:38.665
Some last minute additions,

28:38.759 --> 28:41.250
including Miss Austen.

28:47.310 --> 28:49.596
Alrighty then. She's all yours.

28:53.816 --> 28:57.149
I'm sorry for the mix-up. l'm Juliet.

28:59.071 --> 29:00.186
Kate.

29:00.990 --> 29:03.823
Hi, Kate. Welcome to the island.

29:19.550 --> 29:21.086
What the hell happened?

29:21.177 --> 29:24.169
Sayid just came walking
out of the jungle in handcuffs.

29:24.263 --> 29:27.300
What? He say anything
about the plane they came in on?

29:27.391 --> 29:30.679
Radzinsky thinks he's a hostile.
He won't leave us alone.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.140
I got this.

29:38.694 --> 29:40.946
- Where is he?
- Locked in the storage room.

29:41.030 --> 29:42.065
Give me the key.

29:42.156 --> 29:44.989
You need to know, LaFleur,
he saw the model of the Swan.

29:45.076 --> 29:47.783
Could've seen the survey
of where we're building it.

29:47.870 --> 29:49.030
And your point is?

29:49.121 --> 29:51.703
He's a spy! This whole thing is an act.

29:51.791 --> 29:54.703
And we either play into it or we don't.

29:55.711 --> 29:57.212
We can end this right now.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.253
What the hell are you talking about?

30:02.593 --> 30:04.003
We shoot him.

30:08.307 --> 30:10.684
I appreciate your input, Quick Draw.

30:10.768 --> 30:13.259
But I wanna talk to him first.
Give me the keys.

30:34.417 --> 30:36.703
My name's LaFleur.
l'm Head of Security.

30:37.420 --> 30:40.332
I want you to listen
real carefully to what I got to say.

30:41.173 --> 30:45.712
If you do that, you'll be fine.
Understand?

30:49.640 --> 30:53.349
All right, let's start simple.
ldentify yourself as a hostile.

30:56.564 --> 31:01.103
The terms of the truce say you gotta
identify yourself as a hostile,

31:01.193 --> 31:03.445
or we've got the right to shoot you.

31:04.363 --> 31:07.855
We do not refer to ourselves
as "hostile,"

31:07.950 --> 31:09.941
but yes, I am one of them.

31:13.956 --> 31:17.369
All right, good. Then we can proceed
like a couple of gentlemen.

31:18.419 --> 31:20.831
Let's go.
I'm taking him back to the barracks.

31:20.921 --> 31:23.207
If you're taking him in
I'm coming with you.

31:25.092 --> 31:27.424
I want to talk directly
to Horace about this.

31:27.511 --> 31:29.502
Fine. Talk away.

31:42.359 --> 31:45.567
You wanna remind me
why the hell we're doing this?

31:45.654 --> 31:47.736
Ben said if my husband is on the island,

31:47.823 --> 31:50.405
the best place
to start looking for him is here.

31:50.493 --> 31:54.156
| see, that's some advice you took
before you whacked him in the head.

32:22.024 --> 32:23.264
Tell me you saw that.

32:26.362 --> 32:28.444
Probably just an animal.

32:29.532 --> 32:31.272
An animal. Great.

32:50.052 --> 32:52.668
I'm sorry to say, Sun, but...

32:53.556 --> 32:56.047
...I don't think
we'll find your husband here.

32:56.142 --> 32:58.053
Maybe we ought to just head back.

33:29.133 --> 33:30.418
Hello.

33:31.343 --> 33:32.458
Who the hell are you?

33:34.096 --> 33:35.961
My name's Christian.

33:38.434 --> 33:41.847
I'm looking for my husband.
His name is Jin Kwon.

33:41.937 --> 33:43.598
Do you know where he is?

33:47.443 --> 33:48.774
Follow me.

34:08.964 --> 34:10.215
What is this place?

34:10.299 --> 34:14.212
'72, '76, '78.

34:14.303 --> 34:16.134
Where is my husband?

34:16.222 --> 34:18.304
Here we go, '77.

34:19.934 --> 34:21.390
He's...

34:23.687 --> 34:26.975
- He's with your friends.
- What friends?

34:41.997 --> 34:44.989
I'm sorry, but you have
a bit of a journey ahead of you.

34:51.632 --> 34:53.998
OK, ready? Everybody say...

34:55.135 --> 34:56.420
..."Namaste!"

34:56.512 --> 34:58.628
- Namaste.
- Nama-what?

34:59.431 --> 35:00.762
OK, right on.

35:00.849 --> 35:03.431
You have the rest of the day
to get acquainted

35:03.519 --> 35:06.932
with the security protocol
handbooks waiting in your new digs.

35:07.022 --> 35:11.106
Some of it may seem a little scary,
but we are perfectly safe here.

35:11.193 --> 35:14.936
So make yourselves at home. We've got
hamburgers, we've got punch...

35:15.030 --> 35:17.772
You there, Phil?
We 're coming in with a 14-J.

35:17.866 --> 35:19.276
Roger that, Mr. LaFleur.

35:34.758 --> 35:38.717
lfl could get everyone to hold back.
We have a minor security situation.

35:45.019 --> 35:46.054
Move.

35:58.240 --> 36:00.026
I guess we found Sayid.

36:19.261 --> 36:22.253
Hang out here 'til we figure
out what the hell to do with you.

36:22.348 --> 36:24.134
What are we gonna do with him?

36:26.310 --> 36:29.052
Bring the man some damn food.
We're not savages.

36:47.206 --> 36:52.246
Excuse me. Can you tell me
where James LaFleur lives?

36:52.920 --> 36:54.706
That's his house right there.

36:54.797 --> 36:56.788
Thanks.

36:59.134 --> 37:00.840
But I wouldn't call him James.

37:02.429 --> 37:03.805
He hates it.

37:32.835 --> 37:34.041
Hey, Jack.

37:37.381 --> 37:40.748
I saw you earlier today
when you were helping Kate

37:40.843 --> 37:43.585
and I wanted to say something
to you then but...

37:43.679 --> 37:45.965
We're not supposed
to know each other.

37:46.348 --> 37:48.054
Yeah.

37:51.728 --> 37:54.720
l was looking for Sawyer.
Guess I came to the wrong house.

37:54.815 --> 37:56.646
No, come in.

38:04.032 --> 38:05.693
Evening, Doc.

38:13.292 --> 38:15.954
I'm sure you two have
a lot to talk about.

38:21.592 --> 38:23.628
Take a load off. You want a beer?

38:23.719 --> 38:26.506
No. No, I'm fine.

38:31.018 --> 38:32.554
What can I do for you, Jack?

38:36.815 --> 38:38.806
I don't even know where to start.

38:40.736 --> 38:42.351
How about with Sayid?

38:43.989 --> 38:45.729
I had no choice.

38:45.824 --> 38:49.066
He was running around in the jungle
and got caught by my people.

38:49.161 --> 38:52.278
Seeing as how he can't tell
the truth about how he got here,

38:52.372 --> 38:55.330
- I had to improvise.
- Improvise?

38:57.127 --> 39:00.915
For now, Sayid is safe.
Which is all that matters.

39:04.134 --> 39:05.965
So where do we go from here?

39:06.845 --> 39:07.925
I'm working on it.

39:08.013 --> 39:10.720
Really? It looked to me
like you were reading a book.

39:15.395 --> 39:19.764
I heard once Winston Churchill read a
book every night, even during the Blitz.

39:19.858 --> 39:21.769
They said it made him think better.

39:23.445 --> 39:25.481
That's howl like to run things.

39:25.572 --> 39:27.233
I think.

39:28.617 --> 39:30.699
I'm sure that doesn't mean much to you.

39:30.786 --> 39:33.653
Back when you were calling
the shots you just reacted.

39:35.374 --> 39:37.706
See, you didn't think, Jack.

39:37.793 --> 39:40.705
And as I recall,
a lot of people ended up dead.

39:44.508 --> 39:45.793
I got us off the island.

39:47.594 --> 39:51.086
But here you are.
Right back where you started.

39:52.432 --> 39:55.799
So I'm gonna go back to reading my book.
And I'm gonna think.

39:57.688 --> 40:00.475
'Cause that's how
I saved your ass today.

40:00.607 --> 40:03.189
That's how I'll save Sayid's tomorrow.

40:05.487 --> 40:08.229
All you gotta do is go home,
get a good night's rest,

40:08.323 --> 40:09.938
let me do what I do.

40:13.704 --> 40:15.160
Ain't that a relief?

40:18.292 --> 40:19.452
Yeah.

41:04.713 --> 41:06.044
Hey, Phil.

41:06.131 --> 41:09.043
I'm just gonna go in there
and deliver him a sandwich.

41:10.135 --> 41:11.375
All right.

41:21.480 --> 41:22.560
Hello.

41:29.196 --> 41:30.732
I brought you a sandwich.

41:38.747 --> 41:41.113
I didn't put mustard on it.

41:41.208 --> 41:43.415
But if you'd like some I can get some.

41:46.880 --> 41:48.916
This will be fine. Thank you.

41:51.426 --> 41:52.506
Are you a hostile?

41:55.764 --> 41:57.345
Do you think I am?

42:01.269 --> 42:02.395
What's your name?

42:04.022 --> 42:05.353
Sayid.

42:06.441 --> 42:07.817
What's yours?

42:09.444 --> 42:10.479
l'm Ben.

42:17.494 --> 42:19.655
It's nice to meet you, Ben.
