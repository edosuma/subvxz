01:01.487 --> 01:03.342
- You all right, sir?
- Yes. 

01:04.816 --> 01:06.410
So what are you doing here
at 4:00 in the morning?

01:06.481 --> 01:08.009
I'm a cop. 

01:08.787 --> 01:12.368
- Got a badge?
- Was a cop, I'm leaving town. 

01:14.455 --> 01:17.173
I just thought I'd stand here
for a while till I went. 

01:18.104 --> 01:19.666
That your car?

01:20.314 --> 01:23.218
- What division you work out of?
- Downtown, Homicide. 

01:23.484 --> 01:25.372
- Who runs it?
- Captain Cronjager. 

01:28.639 --> 01:30.298
I can smell booze on you. 

01:33.634 --> 01:35.642
I'm waiting to sober up. 

01:36.388 --> 01:39.619
Want me to drive you home in your car?
My partner can follow us. 

01:42.919 --> 01:44.928
I'll wait till I'm sober. 

01:47.626 --> 01:49.187
Okay. 

03:37.388 --> 03:38.436
Where you from?

03:42.672 --> 03:44.298
Where you headed?

03:48.435 --> 03:49.843
Massachusetts. 

03:51.125 --> 03:52.555
Massachusetts?

03:53.206 --> 03:55.182
All the way to Massachusetts?

03:55.832 --> 03:59.183
You gotta be kidding me, mister.
Massachusetts?

04:00.442 --> 04:03.346
<i>Paradise, Massachusetts is a long way
from home. </i>

04:04.285 --> 04:06.490
But it's been my home for 20 years. 

04:07.999 --> 04:11.613
In many ways, this town and I
grew up together. 

04:13.538 --> 04:17.370
I've appreciated the opportunity
to serve as your police chief

04:17.445 --> 04:20.894
- and I tried never to forget...
- It's a sad day. 

04:20.999 --> 04:24.613
... that the trust
you so generously placed in me

04:25.417 --> 04:26.366
had to be earned. 

04:27.019 --> 04:28.132
Not once, 

04:28.972 --> 04:30.467
but every day. 

04:30.765 --> 04:33.702
So, as I move on, 

04:35.920 --> 04:37.744
I just want to say

04:38.834 --> 04:40.329
thank you. 

04:41.747 --> 04:43.090
So... 

04:43.445 --> 04:45.813
Before I start crying,
does anyone know a good joke?

04:47.127 --> 04:49.845
<i>So, this guy takes his old dog to the vet</i>

04:50.425 --> 04:52.663
and he says, "Doc, it looks
like it hurts when he pees. "

04:52.730 --> 04:54.160
Doc says, "How old is he?"

04:54.235 --> 04:58.710
Guy says, "Twelve. "
Doc says, "He's peed enough. "

05:00.223 --> 05:02.166
Not funny, huh?

05:29.936 --> 05:31.498
Are you all right?

05:34.195 --> 05:35.789
Going far?

05:36.437 --> 05:37.779
Long way. 

05:49.917 --> 05:51.892
I don't see why you feel the need to work. 

05:51.965 --> 05:54.618
I like it.
It gives me a sense of independence. 

05:55.007 --> 05:57.278
Is that new police chief coming this week?

05:57.345 --> 05:58.688
Yeah, from California. 

05:59.843 --> 06:01.120
That's a long away. 

06:01.283 --> 06:03.073
Why is Lou retiring anyway?

06:03.461 --> 06:06.048
He's a relatively young man. 

06:06.887 --> 06:08.349
I don't know.
He said he's fed up with the job. 

06:08.424 --> 06:09.799
He's put his 20 years in. 

06:11.049 --> 06:12.512
Don't you have to be at the bank?

06:12.906 --> 06:14.533
I can go to work when I want. 

06:17.773 --> 06:19.563
That'll look good on you. 

06:20.687 --> 06:21.702
Why don't you come back to bed?

06:22.256 --> 06:24.559
I can't. I'm going to be late. 

06:24.914 --> 06:26.060
Sorry. 

06:54.083 --> 06:57.347
I've always wanted to drive across
country. Take the back roads. 

06:57.797 --> 06:59.325
I got nothing better to do. 

06:59.399 --> 07:01.222
<i>What if you don't get the job?</i>

07:03.337 --> 07:04.800
<i>Where are you?</i>

07:05.994 --> 07:07.489
Missouri, I think. 

07:08.011 --> 07:09.321
<i>What's that noise?</i>

07:09.613 --> 07:10.858
I'm in a phone booth. 

07:10.926 --> 07:13.513
The phone in my room doesn't work.
It's raining. 

07:13.935 --> 07:15.245
<i>You drinking?</i>

07:15.312 --> 07:16.393
Yes. 

07:16.625 --> 07:19.082
<i>You need to be careful of that. </i>

07:19.155 --> 07:20.202
I know. 

07:20.947 --> 07:22.770
<i>Am I losing you, Jesse?</i>

07:23.861 --> 07:26.165
There's some danger of it, Jenn. 

07:57.001 --> 07:58.628
Tequila Sunrise. 

08:01.484 --> 08:02.597
Hi. 

08:05.166 --> 08:06.377
Hi. 

08:14.228 --> 08:16.139
You come here often?

08:16.597 --> 08:18.027
What's your sign?

08:18.358 --> 08:19.853
Is there a hidden camera in here?

08:20.407 --> 08:22.230
Gee, I was sure that would work. 

08:23.321 --> 08:24.784
My name's Sandy. 

08:25.018 --> 08:27.475
- And you are?
- Jesse. 

08:27.964 --> 08:30.868
I'm a student here.
I don't figure you for one. 

08:30.973 --> 08:32.698
Grad student. 

08:34.847 --> 08:36.889
Okay. I'm not in school. 

08:37.826 --> 08:41.057
- What do you do for a living, Jesse?
- I'm an insurance adjuster. 

08:41.220 --> 08:44.222
So, are you working on a case
or you have a thing for college girls?

08:44.294 --> 08:46.270
- Both.
- I'm one. 

08:46.439 --> 08:49.255
- A case or college girl?
- Both. 

08:51.274 --> 08:52.802
And what do you do, Sandy?

08:52.907 --> 08:54.631
I already told you, I'm a student. 

08:56.909 --> 08:58.852
You're kind of old for me. 

09:00.784 --> 09:02.673
Everybody says that. 

09:03.570 --> 09:05.131
You want to go someplace?

09:06.804 --> 09:08.877
That's a very nice offer, Sandy, 

09:10.069 --> 09:12.242
but I'm already going someplace. 

09:14.488 --> 09:15.833
I admire your spirit. You know, just... 

09:17.402 --> 09:21.179
Take all the back roads,
get in the car and just drive. 

09:21.244 --> 09:22.936
I mean, I think it's great. 

09:25.247 --> 09:26.524
Fifty grand. 

09:26.591 --> 09:27.901
Lou. 

09:28.800 --> 09:30.175
It's the end of it. 

09:31.971 --> 09:33.947
Hasty, is there any other way?

09:34.020 --> 09:36.639
No, there's no other way.
Listen, I just can't afford you anymore. 

09:37.510 --> 09:40.610
- We already picked your replacement so...
- You're just gonna have to pay him. 

09:40.776 --> 09:42.817
No, why would I?
The guy's pathetic, he's a loser. 

09:42.921 --> 09:45.956
He's just looking for a nice quiet place
to hide, and I'm gonna give it to him. 

09:46.123 --> 09:47.466
Yeah, well, he just might not be
the answer to that... 

09:47.532 --> 09:49.770
You know what? It's not your problem.
Don't worry about it. 

09:49.837 --> 09:52.708
Just forget about us, forget about this town. 

09:54.960 --> 09:55.976
Hey. 

09:59.763 --> 10:00.779
Gonna miss you. 

10:00.852 --> 10:04.150
Go find what's at
the end of that rainbow, all right?

10:35.240 --> 10:36.703
<i>What time is it there?</i>

10:37.034 --> 10:38.464
10:45. 

10:39.019 --> 10:40.843
<i>It's 7:45 here. </i>

10:40.908 --> 10:42.916
That would be my guess. 

10:43.214 --> 10:45.637
<i>- What are you wearing tomorrow?
- I don't know. </i>

10:45.711 --> 10:48.298
<i>Wear your blue suit.
You look so handsome in it. </i>

10:49.489 --> 10:51.629
<i>I wasn't telling you, Jesse. </i>

10:52.307 --> 10:54.610
<i>I'm thinking about going into therapy. </i>

10:54.837 --> 10:56.212
Well, do me a favor, Jenn. 

10:56.277 --> 10:58.166
If you see a shrink, see a real shrink. 

10:58.551 --> 11:02.131
Not some idiot who reads your aura
and does crystal therapy. 

11:02.265 --> 11:05.879
<i>I'm just so mixed up about things.
My career, and you, and me... </i>

11:05.979 --> 11:07.321
And Elliott. 

11:08.381 --> 11:10.422
<i>I don't want to talk to you
when you're like this!</i>

11:14.849 --> 11:18.080
<i>I made a mistake, but I don't see
why I should be singled out for it. </i>

11:18.147 --> 11:20.450
<i>Everyone's goofed off around here. </i>

11:20.516 --> 11:23.267
<i>The Caine's a slack ship.
The men act like a pack of cutthroats, </i>

11:23.334 --> 11:25.123
<i>the decks look like a Singapore junk. </i>

11:25.447 --> 11:28.994
<i>I take it, then, that you must
also strongly disapprove of leave. </i>

11:29.065 --> 11:30.757
<i>Go ahead, Keith, man to man. </i>

11:30.826 --> 11:32.583
<i>Sir, I'm in no position
to approve or disapprove. </i>

11:33.420 --> 11:36.488
<i>I only know that my conception of
a captain seems different from your own. </i>

11:37.134 --> 11:39.591
<i>I'll take it under advisement. </i>

11:39.664 --> 11:41.388
<i>Since you feel so bitter, </i>

11:41.809 --> 11:44.778
<i>perhaps what's in the dispatch
will brighten your day. </i>

11:47.284 --> 11:50.678
<i>As you can see, Keith,
I'm being relieved of command. </i>

12:38.291 --> 12:39.818
What are you looking at?

13:31.859 --> 13:33.649
You're welcome. 

13:34.421 --> 13:36.527
Obviously, you know,
we think your resume is impressive

13:36.598 --> 13:37.875
or you wouldn't be sitting here. 

13:37.943 --> 13:40.246
So this interview is basically a formality. 

13:40.376 --> 13:44.721
But I am head of town council,
so I guess it's my job to ask. 

13:45.660 --> 13:48.116
We talked to your Captain... 

13:49.310 --> 13:50.773
- Cronjager.
- Cronjager. 

13:51.263 --> 13:53.174
And he speaks well of you, but... 

13:53.248 --> 13:55.584
He fired me for being drunk on the job. 

14:00.229 --> 14:01.691
He said
he thought it might have something to do

14:01.765 --> 14:02.976
with problems in your marriage. 

14:03.271 --> 14:06.174
I guess I did go off the deep
end for a bit, but I'm fine now. 

14:06.312 --> 14:08.484
So, it wasn't an ongoing thing,
you just went through a rough patch

14:08.553 --> 14:10.944
in your marriage and you needed a drink.
I've been there myself. 

14:11.051 --> 14:13.671
You know, when a man like you with your
record applies for a job like this... 

14:13.900 --> 14:16.269
I just think you
had a few too many drinks, I mean... 

14:16.334 --> 14:19.019
Most of us would have done
the same thing under the circumstances. 

14:19.088 --> 14:20.715
I don't have a problem here, do you, Lou?

14:20.881 --> 14:22.343
No problem, Hasty. 

14:25.460 --> 14:27.436
You make sure you give these to the kids. 

14:27.733 --> 14:29.425
I'm gonna miss you, Lou. 

14:30.999 --> 14:32.429
What's the new guy like?

14:33.049 --> 14:34.478
He seemed nice, 

14:34.618 --> 14:37.554
- except he smelled like a brewery.
- You're kidding me. 

14:37.627 --> 14:38.675
Hi!

14:38.748 --> 14:41.749
Hey, Jesse, this is Molly Crane. 

14:42.205 --> 14:44.214
Molly, this is Jesse Stone, your new chief. 

14:44.319 --> 14:46.328
- Nice to meet you, Molly.
- And you. 

14:47.105 --> 14:48.764
This is Boomer. 

14:49.634 --> 14:52.570
Well, I was just packing up a few things.
I'll... 

14:53.188 --> 14:54.498
Don't let me run you out. 

14:54.565 --> 14:56.476
As a matter of fact,
I'd like to talk to you if I could. 

14:57.318 --> 14:59.621
Sure. Please. 

15:11.535 --> 15:13.030
Weird sitting here. 

15:13.712 --> 15:15.470
Is this a first-name department?

15:15.730 --> 15:17.487
- Has been.
- Good. 

15:18.388 --> 15:21.237
- How you feel about retiring?
- Relieved. 

15:21.301 --> 15:23.790
- You didn't like being chief?
- Not really. 

15:23.959 --> 15:25.521
Pay's not worth the aggravation. 

15:25.880 --> 15:27.376
Tell me about the aggravation. 

15:27.641 --> 15:30.098
You, you're used to a big force, big city. 

15:30.171 --> 15:32.856
Here, you're an employee of the town. 

15:32.988 --> 15:35.805
And sometimes the town and the police

15:35.870 --> 15:38.523
don't exactly agree
on how things should get done. 

15:38.592 --> 15:40.633
That's exactly what I'm used to. 

15:42.146 --> 15:43.357
So, what're you going to do?

15:44.387 --> 15:47.203
I was going to throw the fishing rod
in the back of the car and drive. 

15:47.268 --> 15:48.796
Never did that before. 

15:48.870 --> 15:50.081
Always wanted to. 

15:50.695 --> 15:52.868
Mr. Stone, it's your new boss. 

15:52.969 --> 15:55.141
Just press the lighted button. 

16:03.663 --> 16:05.005
Change your mind?

16:05.071 --> 16:08.422
<i>Listen, Jesse, we're having a little
fundraiser at our yacht club Saturday. </i>

16:08.530 --> 16:10.222
<i>I think you should be there. </i>

16:10.291 --> 16:12.496
<i>- I will be.
- Good. </i>

16:16.598 --> 16:18.542
Well, good luck. 

16:19.256 --> 16:20.784
Thank you, Lou. 

16:41.414 --> 16:46.152
Here's Lou Carson's badge and gun.
They belong to the department. 

16:46.313 --> 16:49.097
Thanks, but I got my own gun.
I will need a permit. 

16:49.162 --> 16:50.340
Yes, you will. 

16:50.443 --> 16:52.233
And I guess I'll need some business cards. 

16:52.300 --> 16:53.828
Well, I think you should get some. 

16:58.736 --> 17:01.225
What exactly do you do, Molly?

17:01.297 --> 17:02.792
I'm a police officer. 

17:02.866 --> 17:04.940
Actually, most of the time,
I'm the dispatcher. 

17:05.012 --> 17:06.060
Who do you dispatch?

17:06.133 --> 17:09.747
- Usually one of two people, small town.
- You know a good realtor?

17:09.815 --> 17:13.592
I know who my boss would recommend.
I think I got a card someplace. 

17:31.428 --> 17:35.041
Officer Simpson just called. They have
a domestic dispute out on Sylvan Road. 

17:35.110 --> 17:36.419
I think you should be there. 

17:36.711 --> 17:38.141
Okay. 

17:41.098 --> 17:43.008
You know where Sylvan Road is?

17:45.068 --> 17:46.563
No. 

17:48.590 --> 17:50.085
Thank you. 

17:52.080 --> 17:55.880
I don't think I smell like a brewery.
I was drinking Scotch. 

18:20.450 --> 18:22.109
- Jesse Stone.
- Luther Simpson. 

18:22.178 --> 18:23.423
Walk with me. 

18:24.228 --> 18:25.374
Carole Genest called us. 

18:25.445 --> 18:28.032
Said her ex-husband forced his way
into the house, threatened her. 

18:28.102 --> 18:30.208
- Who's the kid?
- Their daughter. 

18:30.664 --> 18:33.349
He's pretty belligerent. D'Angelo's
up there trying to calm him down. 

18:33.481 --> 18:35.043
Don't let her come in. 

18:38.476 --> 18:41.096
Why don't you give me the divorce?
What do you want?

18:41.166 --> 18:42.727
- You want money?
- You got money. 

18:42.895 --> 18:45.318
- So what! So what!
- Anthony D'Angelo. How are you doing?

18:45.873 --> 18:48.689
- Any more kids in the house?
- There's a couple of kids upstairs. 

18:48.755 --> 18:50.130
- Who are you?
- You got kids, Anthony?

18:50.516 --> 18:51.945
Yeah, I got three. 

18:52.116 --> 18:54.801
- Do what you can to make them feel safe.
- Okay. 

18:54.870 --> 18:56.759
Hey, buddy, I said, who are you?

19:02.170 --> 19:03.927
I'm the new police chief, sir. 

19:04.989 --> 19:07.412
Oh, yeah. I heard about you. 

19:07.486 --> 19:09.309
Only good things, I hope. 

19:09.407 --> 19:10.814
Oh, you're a funny guy. 

19:11.872 --> 19:14.743
Does Mrs. Genest have
a restraining order on you, sir?

19:14.851 --> 19:15.833
Yeah, so?

19:15.907 --> 19:17.697
He's gonna kill me one day, the bastard. 

19:17.764 --> 19:20.067
- Did he say he was going to kill you?
- Every time I see him. 

19:20.133 --> 19:23.452
- Can you people do anything about him?
- Yes, ma'am, we can. 

19:23.527 --> 19:26.399
Did he hit you or in any way assault you?

19:26.569 --> 19:27.781
No, not this time. 

19:31.725 --> 19:32.936
She's okay. 

19:33.965 --> 19:35.046
Did he force his way in?

19:35.119 --> 19:39.016
Yeah, yeah, I tried to lock the door,
but he's still got a key. 

19:39.153 --> 19:41.489
- It's my house.
- Has he assaulted you in the past?

19:41.554 --> 19:43.944
Sure, he's beat the crap out of me
a lot of times. 

19:44.020 --> 19:46.061
Well, we probably don't have
an assault charge here. 

19:46.646 --> 19:48.851
We may get forced entry
even though he had a key. 

19:48.919 --> 19:52.434
But obviously, we've got him for
violating the restraining order. 

19:52.505 --> 19:54.873
Restraining order don't mean crap,
and you know it. 

19:55.419 --> 19:56.663
Yes, sir, I know. 

19:57.148 --> 20:00.411
I just go to court with my lawyer,
they issue a new restraining order. 

20:00.574 --> 20:02.168
I am out of there in 20 minutes. 

20:02.239 --> 20:04.476
That's the way it usually works,
especially if you've got some money. 

20:04.545 --> 20:05.887
Which I do. 

20:07.298 --> 20:08.542
So... 

20:08.835 --> 20:12.766
I guess that means I get to come in here
and visit my wife

20:14.182 --> 20:15.841
just as much as I please. 

20:17.832 --> 20:19.262
Is that true?

20:21.642 --> 20:23.050
You just said
there's nothing you can do about it. 

20:23.115 --> 20:26.914
No, sir, I said the restraining order
probably wouldn't work. 

20:27.374 --> 20:28.749
Isn't that the same thing?

20:29.295 --> 20:30.473
Not really. 

20:39.990 --> 20:41.649
If you come near this woman again, 

20:41.974 --> 20:45.621
if anything happens to her, or her kids,
no matter what, 

20:45.849 --> 20:47.541
no matter whose fault it is, 

20:47.610 --> 20:51.355
I will kick you around this town
until you look like road kill. 

20:52.957 --> 20:55.829
And if you're annoying, like you were today, 

20:56.896 --> 20:58.969
I just might shoot you. 

21:01.538 --> 21:04.387
Stay here with D'Angelo
until Mr. Genest leaves. 

21:04.645 --> 21:06.206
What if he comes back?

21:06.501 --> 21:08.924
I don't think he'll come back. 

21:16.780 --> 21:19.334
Molly, can I get a cup of coffee?

21:19.629 --> 21:21.223
If you make it. 

21:21.295 --> 21:24.712
Just because I'm the dispatcher
doesn't mean I can't do police work. 

21:32.470 --> 21:34.380
We need to talk. 

21:37.080 --> 21:40.311
I should have introduced myself earlier.
I'm Abby Taylor, the city attorney. 

21:40.378 --> 21:41.361
Jesse Stone. 

21:41.434 --> 21:43.738
- May I call you Jesse?
- Of course, Abby. 

21:45.758 --> 21:49.819
Whatever the circumstances
of your police work in Los Angeles, 

21:50.176 --> 21:53.047
this is a town where everyone's
civil liberties are important. 

21:53.122 --> 21:56.320
Now, I can certainly sympathize
with Carole Genest's situation, 

21:56.420 --> 21:58.658
but you cannot go around
beating people up. 

21:59.013 --> 22:01.054
- Can I ask you a question?
- Of course. 

22:01.350 --> 22:04.768
You asked if you could call me Jesse.
I said you could, but you didn't. 

22:05.385 --> 22:07.458
- Excuse me?
- You didn't use my name. 

22:07.883 --> 22:10.786
What does that have to do
with you assaulting Mr. Genest?

22:11.052 --> 22:12.362
Just seemed odd to me. 

22:14.062 --> 22:17.578
Do you have anything to say on
the matter of your assault on Mr. Genest?

22:17.841 --> 22:21.323
The restraining order wasn't working.
Think of me as implementing it. 

22:21.619 --> 22:24.468
You really need to take this more seriously. 

22:28.151 --> 22:31.830
You really need to take
this more seriously, Jesse. 

22:32.697 --> 22:35.896
You really need to take
this more seriously, Jesse. 

22:35.964 --> 22:37.426
No, I don't, Abby. 

22:37.500 --> 22:39.411
You don't make it easy, Jesse. 

22:39.486 --> 22:42.237
Joe Genest should be kicked
in the gonads once a day. 

22:42.399 --> 22:44.670
It was necessary to get his attention. 

22:44.737 --> 22:47.324
The town council is prepared
to go forward from here, 

22:47.650 --> 22:48.796
but they would like your assurance

22:48.867 --> 22:51.007
that something like this
will not occur in the future. 

22:51.077 --> 22:53.893
- It might.
- You don't give an inch, do you?

22:54.022 --> 22:55.332
Jesse. 

22:55.751 --> 22:56.832
Jesse. 

22:58.825 --> 23:01.641
Have you had much experience
with people like Mr. Genest?

23:01.804 --> 23:05.101
People in South Central L. A.
Would keep Joe Genest for a pet. 

23:05.165 --> 23:06.573
Are you married, Abby?

23:07.726 --> 23:08.905
No. 

23:09.007 --> 23:11.660
I don't see what that has to do
with the issue before us. 

23:11.729 --> 23:12.974
Me, either. 

23:13.202 --> 23:14.348
Have you ever been married?

23:14.419 --> 23:16.143
- Yes.
- But you're not married now?

23:16.212 --> 23:17.195
No. 

23:17.269 --> 23:18.415
- Divorced?
- Yes. 

23:19.862 --> 23:23.344
Jesse, one of the rules of conversation
is that when asked a question, 

23:23.416 --> 23:25.239
you don't give a one-word answer. 

23:25.306 --> 23:28.177
Okay, want to have dinner with me?

23:30.013 --> 23:31.442
Yes. 

23:41.892 --> 23:42.940
It's good. 

23:43.620 --> 23:45.050
Holster your weapon. 

23:46.214 --> 23:47.327
You might want to get into the habit

23:47.399 --> 23:49.375
of keeping your finger
outside the trigger guard. 

23:49.896 --> 23:50.911
If you're handling a suspect, 

23:50.985 --> 23:53.540
you might get a sympathetic response
and shoot somebody. 

23:53.963 --> 23:57.226
And you don't just stand there,
you shoot and move. 

24:03.633 --> 24:05.739
How'd you learn to shoot like that?

24:06.226 --> 24:07.437
Practice. 

24:14.487 --> 24:16.823
So, in a fight, front sight. 

24:19.161 --> 24:22.098
You hear I was drunk at my job interview?

24:22.684 --> 24:24.409
I did hear something about that. 

24:24.573 --> 24:25.686
- Small town.
- Small town. 

24:28.256 --> 24:31.454
I wouldn't have hired me, would you?

24:32.065 --> 24:35.067
Well, I don't know. 

24:36.356 --> 24:39.140
Any idea why Lou Carson retired?

24:39.846 --> 24:41.308
I don't know. 

24:44.329 --> 24:47.081
<i>Hello, you've reached Paradise Realty.
Please leave a message. </i>

24:48.139 --> 24:51.141
My name's Jesse Stone.
I'm calling about finding a residence. 

24:51.245 --> 24:54.149
You can reach me at the police station.
Thank you. 

24:55.472 --> 24:56.901
<i>- I'll start with an egg.
- All righty. </i>

24:56.976 --> 24:58.919
<i>One egg. Now, you don't have to use eggs. </i>

26:16.512 --> 26:18.007
Paradise Police Station. 

26:18.306 --> 26:20.991
- Hey, Molly.
- Hey, Lou. Where are you?

26:21.123 --> 26:22.401
I don't know. 

26:23.076 --> 26:24.571
Doesn't really matter. 

26:25.158 --> 26:27.395
This just doesn't make any sense. 

26:28.520 --> 26:31.369
Maybe you'll be surprised about Stone. 

26:32.234 --> 26:34.439
He's got more iron in him
than I was expecting. 

26:34.507 --> 26:35.915
Yeah, maybe I won't. 

26:35.980 --> 26:38.021
Boy, does this guy have baggage. 

26:41.200 --> 26:44.584
Listen, Molly,
there's something I want you to know. 

26:45.811 --> 26:47.754
<i>I always enjoyed working with you. </i>

26:49.301 --> 26:51.244
And I consider you my friend. 

26:52.310 --> 26:53.740
Thanks, Lou. 

26:54.135 --> 26:55.478
<i>Keep in touch. </i>

26:56.409 --> 26:58.133
Bye, Molly. 

27:21.319 --> 27:22.268
What are you doing?

28:13.255 --> 28:15.111
I don't think he'll do that again. 

28:15.880 --> 28:17.507
Maybe not if you're around. 

28:18.186 --> 28:20.130
He hasn't bothered me since that day. 

28:22.092 --> 28:24.068
How long are you going to
stick around here for?

28:25.326 --> 28:26.603
I don't know. 

28:30.001 --> 28:33.167
I'm worried about Michelle. She's older... 

28:33.235 --> 28:35.986
- How old is she?
- Fifteen. 

28:36.053 --> 28:37.482
- Tough age.
- Yeah. 

28:38.518 --> 28:40.308
She took the divorce really hard. 

28:41.016 --> 28:43.920
- She hates her dad.
- That's too bad. 

28:44.058 --> 28:46.612
- You think so?
- Fathers are important. 

28:48.380 --> 28:50.650
- You want some more coffee?
- Yes, thank you. 

28:53.568 --> 28:55.871
- Luther?
- Yes, ma'am. 

28:57.634 --> 28:59.522
You get the house as part of the divorce?

28:59.587 --> 29:01.377
Yeah, yeah. 

29:02.213 --> 29:04.156
He's supposed to pay me alimony,
but he never does. 

29:04.230 --> 29:05.889
Must be tough to keep the payments up. 

29:05.991 --> 29:06.940
Well, I... 

29:07.239 --> 29:10.208
You know, I got to pay taxes quarterly,
but at least there's no mortgage. 

29:10.281 --> 29:11.875
- Well, that's good.
- Yeah. 

29:11.946 --> 29:14.369
Joe bought it for cash when we got married. 

29:17.486 --> 29:18.731
What's he do?

29:22.033 --> 29:25.963
He works in Boston.
He never shared his work with me. 

29:26.515 --> 29:30.227
My ex-husband has a very bad temper. 

29:31.094 --> 29:33.462
I learned very early not to question him. 

29:35.033 --> 29:38.330
Besides, I'm not very smart. 

29:39.067 --> 29:42.331
I never learned anything in school.
I didn't even graduate. 

29:42.653 --> 29:44.826
Taking care of me was his job, right?

29:45.983 --> 29:47.610
Well, I'll talk to him. 

29:48.769 --> 29:51.159
You know,
you're going to need to be careful. 

29:51.747 --> 29:54.912
Joe's mean. He's gonna wanna get even. 

29:56.133 --> 29:57.595
Joe's a fake. 

29:58.054 --> 30:02.017
Sometimes for a minute he knows it
and he knows that I know it, too. 

30:02.537 --> 30:04.481
He isn't really tough. 

30:04.938 --> 30:06.346
And you are?

30:07.308 --> 30:08.869
Yes, ma'am. I am. 

30:12.239 --> 30:15.023
I find dealing with cash
unbelievably tedious. 

30:15.088 --> 30:16.616
Yeah, but you're pretty good at that. 

30:16.690 --> 30:19.409
Started as a teller, worked my way up. 

30:22.677 --> 30:25.875
I hear you had a little run-in
with our new chief. 

30:26.392 --> 30:28.760
Yeah, the son of a bitch blindsided me. 

30:29.113 --> 30:32.912
I hope your little personal and petty
problems with him don't get in our way. 

30:32.987 --> 30:34.646
He's the chief of police. 

30:36.061 --> 30:37.239
So what?

30:37.406 --> 30:41.402
I get $1, 114, 905. You wanna do a recount?

30:41.472 --> 30:42.782
I'll take your count. 

30:42.849 --> 30:46.168
Okay, well, then, your share
of my eight percent... 

30:47.268 --> 30:49.124
$22, 298. 

30:49.702 --> 30:51.743
Oh, that's the wrong number, Hasty. 

30:52.359 --> 30:54.051
We're equal partners now. 

30:55.113 --> 30:56.543
Well, Joe, I don't want to diminish

30:56.618 --> 30:58.659
your very valuable contribution
to this little enterprise, 

30:58.731 --> 31:00.139
but there's no way in hell
you're getting half... 

31:00.236 --> 31:01.927
Lou Carson's dead. 

31:05.103 --> 31:06.216
What?

31:06.320 --> 31:08.743
He had a terrible accident. 

31:14.836 --> 31:17.074
What an incredibly stupid thing to do. 

31:17.622 --> 31:20.242
Don't worry, they're never gonna find him. 

31:20.632 --> 31:23.351
He knew everything.
Come on, he was a danger to us. 

31:24.762 --> 31:28.081
- He never would have said a word.
- What difference does it make?

31:28.157 --> 31:29.335
He's dead. 

31:31.263 --> 31:33.174
That makes you an accessory. 

31:34.080 --> 31:35.063
So... 

31:35.553 --> 31:36.896
From now on

31:38.115 --> 31:39.392
I get half. 

31:41.028 --> 31:42.141
Thanks. 

31:43.430 --> 31:46.050
I wouldn't have figured you
for a beer drinker. 

31:46.664 --> 31:49.087
I'm not. I'm a Scotch on the rocks drinker. 

31:49.738 --> 31:52.390
Just didn't want to get drunk
on our first date. 

31:52.651 --> 31:54.059
Do you get drunk?

31:54.284 --> 31:56.675
I have trouble stopping when I start. 

31:58.031 --> 32:00.683
Is that what happened on the job interview?

32:01.841 --> 32:04.210
Actually,
I had way too much the night before. 

32:04.275 --> 32:07.790
I just made the mistake
of having one in the morning to steady up. 

32:09.334 --> 32:12.849
Well, he hired you anyway,
so he must have seen something in you. 

32:13.656 --> 32:16.407
- Maybe.
- Why maybe?

32:16.954 --> 32:18.810
I wouldn't have hired me. 

32:20.861 --> 32:22.684
What's your take on our boss?

32:23.230 --> 32:27.324
My father told me to never trust a man
that smiles all the time. 

32:27.392 --> 32:28.800
That's good advice. 

32:29.761 --> 32:32.064
If you want a Scotch, go ahead. 

32:32.484 --> 32:34.427
I'm willing to risk it if you are. 

32:39.015 --> 32:41.438
Did your ex-wife ever remarry?

32:41.513 --> 32:43.969
No, but she's in another guy's bed a lot. 

32:44.203 --> 32:45.992
And that hurts. 

32:48.941 --> 32:51.561
Maybe it would help if you got even. 

32:58.643 --> 33:01.874
I think coffee and donuts
tend to certify one's copness. 

33:01.941 --> 33:03.316
Thanks for buying. 

33:03.958 --> 33:06.229
I'm trying to prove I'm a regular guy. 

33:08.313 --> 33:09.841
Luther your real name?

33:09.914 --> 33:13.145
My mother teaches Sunday school.
She's a very religious person. 

33:13.212 --> 33:15.450
Named me after some religious guy. 

33:15.517 --> 33:17.493
Gym teacher called me Spider
when I was in the fourth grade

33:17.567 --> 33:19.094
and that stuck for a while. 

33:19.167 --> 33:23.064
- I don't see you as a Spider.
- Well, what do you see me as?

33:23.458 --> 33:25.182
Stop the car, Suitcase. 

33:25.251 --> 33:26.779
- What did you say?
- Stop the car. 

33:26.852 --> 33:28.282
No, after that. 

33:38.123 --> 33:40.612
Drive around the block a couple of times,
Suitcase. 

33:53.813 --> 33:55.636
You gonna run me out of here or what?

33:55.702 --> 33:56.717
No. 

33:56.886 --> 34:00.271
You come here, you smoke dope.
I chase you out, you come back. 

34:00.345 --> 34:01.971
It's a waste of my time and yours. 

34:02.393 --> 34:05.297
- You gonna kick me in the nuts?
- That would be difficult. 

34:08.317 --> 34:09.627
You know, 

34:10.591 --> 34:13.626
- you can't prove I'm smoking dope.
- Doesn't matter. 

34:13.697 --> 34:15.257
So, why don't you just
leave me alone, then?

34:15.329 --> 34:18.047
- Why don't you go to school?
- School sucks. 

34:27.529 --> 34:29.897
So, I guess you just think it's okay
to push me around?

34:29.962 --> 34:32.746
- Am I pushing you around, Michelle?
- How do you know my name?

34:32.812 --> 34:35.116
I'm the police chief, I know everything. 

34:38.512 --> 34:40.902
You know, I saw you going
into the Gray Gull last night. 

34:41.746 --> 34:43.152
Small town. 

34:43.667 --> 34:45.806
Aren't you a little old for her?

34:46.292 --> 34:49.293
I don't know. Maybe I'll ask her. 

34:49.525 --> 34:51.152
Did you have a drink?

34:51.927 --> 34:53.521
Yes, I did. 

34:53.656 --> 34:55.795
So how come that's okay
and smoking dope isn't?

34:55.866 --> 34:58.770
It's legal, and smoking dope is illegal. 

34:58.844 --> 35:02.010
- So that makes it right?
- Nope, just legal and illegal. 

35:02.590 --> 35:05.407
- Well, that sucks.
- A lot of things suck. 

35:06.336 --> 35:10.910
You said stuff was just legal or illegal.
Well, what about it being right or wrong?

35:10.979 --> 35:14.593
I'm not in the right and wrong business.
I'm in the legal and illegal business. 

35:14.661 --> 35:17.511
- You just don't want to answer.
- No, I don't mind answering. 

35:17.960 --> 35:20.383
Actually, that was part of my answer. 

35:21.001 --> 35:23.490
You and I both know
that sitting around here all day

35:23.563 --> 35:25.986
smoking dope isn't the right thing
to do with your life. 

35:26.060 --> 35:28.265
Who the hell are you
to say what's right for me?

35:28.526 --> 35:29.934
The guy you asked. 

35:35.698 --> 35:39.181
Most people don't have trouble seeing
what's right and wrong. 

35:39.412 --> 35:41.802
Doing it is sometimes complicated, 

35:41.877 --> 35:44.497
but knowing what's right
usually isn't so hard. 

35:45.432 --> 35:48.783
And chasing you out of here
is obviously not the right way

35:49.050 --> 35:50.939
to help you do the right thing. 

35:51.164 --> 35:55.127
- So, why are you still here?
- Trying to do the right thing. 

36:05.444 --> 36:06.906
It has a living area. 

36:06.981 --> 36:09.830
It has a kitchen with a dining area
and a half bath. 

36:09.894 --> 36:11.805
- Mrs. Hathaway...
- Cissy. 

36:12.616 --> 36:14.144
I think I want a house. 

36:14.601 --> 36:16.425
Excuse me, Jesse,
I don't mean to offend you, 

36:16.491 --> 36:18.826
but within your budget range... 

36:19.692 --> 36:20.937
You know, it's the people from Boston, 

36:21.006 --> 36:23.757
they keep coming up here
and driving the prices up. 

36:25.136 --> 36:27.593
Actually, there is a place I could show you. 

36:28.498 --> 36:30.091
It's absolutely charming. 

36:30.323 --> 36:33.707
You have the ocean on both sides,
and it's extremely private. 

36:33.781 --> 36:36.652
Pretty isolated. Where's the garage?

36:36.727 --> 36:38.703
Well, there isn't one. 

36:38.776 --> 36:42.040
But you just park your car back there
and take this bridge. 

36:42.939 --> 36:45.526
Might be a drag if you're carrying groceries. 

36:51.264 --> 36:52.759
This is it. 

36:57.667 --> 36:59.523
Floors are originals of the house. 

36:59.588 --> 37:01.793
You don't see craftsmanship
like that anymore. 

37:01.862 --> 37:05.890
And it's very reasonable.
Well within your budget range. 

37:06.345 --> 37:09.096
- You mean, it's cheap?
- Exactly. 

37:11.084 --> 37:12.361
I'll take it. 

37:12.973 --> 37:15.822
I think you're going to
be very happy here, Jesse. 

37:17.647 --> 37:19.241
You think so?

37:23.796 --> 37:27.475
- Well, thanks, Skipper.
- D'Angelo, please, don't call me Skipper. 

37:27.734 --> 37:31.282
- Your appointment's here.
- I don't have an appointment. 

37:35.834 --> 37:37.591
- Jesse?
- Yeah. 

37:38.204 --> 37:40.507
I'm Captain Healey,
State Police, Homicide Commander. 

37:40.574 --> 37:42.582
Nice to meet you. Sit down. 

37:43.999 --> 37:46.849
I work out of Boston, but I live up this way. 

37:46.977 --> 37:50.874
- I've been meaning to stop by.
- I'm glad you did. 

37:53.637 --> 37:56.388
- You like Scotch?
- I do. 

37:56.455 --> 37:59.272
- Want some pizza?
- No, thanks. 

37:59.592 --> 38:01.601
I like pizza, it don't like me. 

38:02.571 --> 38:04.295
So, I hear

38:05.228 --> 38:07.947
- you're up from L. A. , right?
- Right. 

38:08.014 --> 38:10.983
- That's a long way from Paradise.
- Long way. 

38:11.632 --> 38:13.575
You worked homicide?

38:14.065 --> 38:15.178
Yeah. 

38:15.922 --> 38:17.450
I know Cronjager. 

38:20.149 --> 38:21.579
How's it going?

38:23.031 --> 38:24.439
I don't drink

38:25.080 --> 38:26.324
on the job. 

38:27.770 --> 38:29.876
Good night, Skipper. You gonna lock up?

38:29.947 --> 38:32.217
- I will.
- Thanks. 

38:33.341 --> 38:36.507
So, I hear you used to play ball. 

38:36.575 --> 38:39.228
Double-A,
tore up my shoulder, and that was that. 

38:39.489 --> 38:42.043
The Phillies signed me as a pitcher. 

38:42.339 --> 38:46.367
- And?
- And I wasn't good enough. 

38:48.327 --> 38:49.669
You miss it?

38:50.663 --> 38:51.941
Every day. 

38:58.796 --> 39:00.390
Lou Carson's dead. 

39:02.159 --> 39:04.680
Went off the road, drowned in his car. 

39:05.488 --> 39:07.530
There weren't any witnesses. 

39:07.730 --> 39:10.667
The local police
aren't even sure when it happened. 

39:10.740 --> 39:14.222
Their ME says he's been in the water
at least a few days. 

39:14.518 --> 39:17.815
Found alcohol in his blood.
Lou liked to drink. 

39:18.745 --> 39:19.890
Family?

39:21.626 --> 39:23.995
Divorced, lived alone. 

39:24.220 --> 39:27.037
So nobody reported him missing. 

39:27.165 --> 39:29.949
If the fisherman hadn't seen
his car in the water... 

39:31.136 --> 39:33.276
You released it to the press yet?

39:34.018 --> 39:36.737
Not yet. I'm gonna hold it. 

39:36.804 --> 39:40.002
Take a look at it.
Make sure it was an accident. 

39:40.069 --> 39:42.559
- Doesn't sound right.
- Why?

39:44.680 --> 39:46.274
No reason. 

39:51.340 --> 39:54.691
Anyway, I thought you should know. 

41:08.539 --> 41:11.704
<i>Welcome to Northeastern Bell.
If you have any problems... </i>

41:23.139 --> 41:24.416
<i>- Hello.
- Hi. </i>

41:25.060 --> 41:27.233
<i>- Hi.
- You okay?</i>

41:27.719 --> 41:29.028
<i>Not really. </i>

41:29.223 --> 41:30.686
<i>Broke up with Elliott. </i>

41:30.761 --> 41:31.874
I'm shocked. 

41:32.393 --> 41:35.045
<i>Don't make fun of me, Jesse. It's too easy. </i>

41:36.204 --> 41:37.382
I'm sorry. 

41:39.213 --> 41:41.483
<i>You think I'm a dreadful fool,
don't you, Jesse?</i>

41:41.551 --> 41:43.854
I think you do foolish things
sometimes, Jenn. 

41:43.920 --> 41:45.514
I don't think you're dreadful. 

41:46.289 --> 41:47.752
<i>Have you met anyone?</i>

41:48.466 --> 41:49.645
Yes. 

41:49.972 --> 41:51.435
<i>Do you love her?</i>

41:53.206 --> 41:54.319
Not yet. 

41:56.632 --> 41:58.673
I don't think I belong here, though. 

41:59.482 --> 42:01.556
<i>- You mean, you didn't get the job?
- No, I got the job. </i>

42:01.627 --> 42:04.050
I'm just not so sure they should've hired me. 

42:04.829 --> 42:07.383
<i>- Are you drinking?
- Not on the job. </i>

42:48.472 --> 42:51.375
I'll need you to drive me into town
to pick up my car. 

42:53.242 --> 42:57.041
I called the towing garage. I'll clean
up the paint before they get here. 

42:59.902 --> 43:01.364
Leave it alone. 

43:05.313 --> 43:08.631
Thank you. Sorry about your car. 

43:10.597 --> 43:13.216
- Your boss called.
- You don't like him, do you?

43:13.286 --> 43:14.694
I think he's a son of a bitch. 

43:14.759 --> 43:18.274
Anyway, he wants you to meet him for
breakfast at the coffee shop in 15 minutes. 

43:18.345 --> 43:20.005
I already had breakfast. 

43:26.189 --> 43:29.453
- Molly, I know you and Lou were close.
- Still are. 

43:31.345 --> 43:32.775
Lou's dead. 

43:34.386 --> 43:36.592
He drowned. His car went off the road. 

43:37.045 --> 43:39.217
- But I just spoke to him.
- When?

43:40.087 --> 43:41.549
First day out. 

43:47.195 --> 43:49.400
You want to go home? Take the day off?

43:53.694 --> 43:56.827
Molly, I don't want you to talk
about this to anybody. 

43:56.896 --> 43:58.391
Even Simpson, D'Angelo. 

44:01.091 --> 44:02.237
I'm sorry. 

44:24.465 --> 44:26.354
Who do you think
did that to your car, Skipper?

44:27.059 --> 44:28.042
Jesse. 

44:28.372 --> 44:31.024
- Jesse.
- Come in. Close the door behind you. 

44:33.750 --> 44:36.141
I want this to be between just you and me. 

44:41.403 --> 44:42.811
I need a hat. 

44:43.741 --> 44:45.051
We got hats, Skipper. 

44:45.694 --> 44:48.663
How do I put this delicately?
I don't like them. 

44:50.305 --> 44:51.288
I'm used to navy blue. 

44:51.361 --> 44:54.211
Can you have one made up for me?
PPD, silver letters?

44:55.075 --> 44:58.208
And maybe you could have them embroider
"Chief" on the back. 

44:58.565 --> 45:00.476
- I guess so.
- Good. 

45:01.384 --> 45:03.207
Who's gonna pay for it?

45:04.970 --> 45:07.426
- I will.
- Okay. 

45:13.038 --> 45:14.665
This may come as a complete shock to you, 

45:14.735 --> 45:16.329
but I've been hearing
good things about you. 

45:16.401 --> 45:18.857
No, I couldn't be happier about
the job you're doing. 

45:18.930 --> 45:22.762
Well, I was under the impression you didn't
like the way I handled Joe Genest. 

45:22.836 --> 45:27.029
Well, officially that's true. But off the
record, I think he got what he deserved. 

45:27.447 --> 45:30.995
- So you know him?
- Well, I know who he is. It's a small town. 

45:31.225 --> 45:32.567
You sure I can't bring you anything, Chief?

45:32.634 --> 45:35.603
- No, I already ate. Thanks.
- Thank you, Tammy. 

45:37.277 --> 45:40.214
I understand that Captain Healey
was in your office last night. 

45:41.408 --> 45:43.318
- Yes.
- How's he doing?

45:43.393 --> 45:45.915
I don't know,
he just stopped by to introduce himself. 

45:45.986 --> 45:47.994
Oh, I see. What did you guys talk about?

45:48.067 --> 45:51.746
- Baseball, mostly.
- Baseball. Anything else?

45:52.197 --> 45:53.507
Not really. Why?

45:53.863 --> 45:57.214
Well, it's just that we like to handle
our own problems here in Paradise. 

45:57.289 --> 46:00.640
In fact, if you do have a problem, Jesse,
I'd like you to call me first. 

46:00.715 --> 46:03.335
I mean it, I don't care if
it's the middle of the night, you call me. 

46:03.405 --> 46:05.195
- Anytime?
- Anytime. 

46:05.806 --> 46:08.295
- Well, I appreciate that, Hasty.
- Sure. 

46:09.104 --> 46:11.145
- Thanks for the coffee.
- All right. 

46:11.665 --> 46:14.864
You seem to have made a decision
not to wear a uniform. 

46:15.605 --> 46:18.541
- Oh, well, actually I...
- It's okay, I don't mind. 

46:19.350 --> 46:21.555
I'm growing really fond of you, Jesse. 

46:21.944 --> 46:24.312
- See you. Yeah.
- See you. 

46:37.313 --> 46:40.282
- I think I'm overdressed.
- I told you, small town. 

46:40.355 --> 46:43.652
But when I heard yacht club I was
thinking blue blazers and deck shoes. 

46:44.741 --> 46:46.815
Well, that's what Hasty's wearing. 

46:47.271 --> 46:49.476
The bow tie is his party trademark. 

46:49.705 --> 46:52.456
At Christmas,
he has one with red and green lights. 

46:52.651 --> 46:54.026
Sporty guy. 

47:04.274 --> 47:06.217
- Hi, Peter.
- Hi, Abby. 

47:06.291 --> 47:08.397
Jesse, this is Dr. Peter Perkins. 

47:08.692 --> 47:10.832
- I heard about you.
- Everybody says that. 

47:10.902 --> 47:13.805
- Peter has a very successful practice here.
- Really?

47:13.879 --> 47:17.143
Jesse Stone.
Abby, could I borrow Jesse for a dance?

47:17.689 --> 47:19.862
- A short one.
- Come on. 

47:20.827 --> 47:22.137
Nice meeting you. 

47:25.663 --> 47:28.315
- So how's the house coming?
- It's charming. 

47:38.534 --> 47:41.831
- Do you like my dress?
- Yes, I do. 

47:42.472 --> 47:45.507
Can you tell that I'm not wearing
anything underneath it?

47:45.866 --> 47:47.656
I wasn't sure. 

47:48.075 --> 47:51.012
Is that something you might be
interested in seeing?

47:58.162 --> 47:59.472
Here's the deal. 

47:59.955 --> 48:02.509
I like men and I like sex. 

48:03.157 --> 48:06.607
And assuming you're interested,
we could have something very nice

48:06.839 --> 48:10.157
and very uncomplicated
with nothing at stake. 

48:11.354 --> 48:12.467
Wow. 

48:13.019 --> 48:14.809
Hi. May I cut in?

48:16.157 --> 48:19.257
That was short. By all means. 

48:21.184 --> 48:23.095
I didn't know that you knew Cissy Hathaway. 

48:23.169 --> 48:24.118
Yeah. 

48:24.962 --> 48:26.490
She found me my house. 

48:27.876 --> 48:31.358
And how does she stack up as a kisser?

48:32.359 --> 48:34.051
There's better. 

48:39.755 --> 48:42.659
Will trouble find you if I use the facilities?

48:42.957 --> 48:44.070
Hard to say. 

48:47.216 --> 48:48.558
Jesse. 

48:50.802 --> 48:53.673
Scotch on the rocks your drink?
Yeah, I had a feeling. 

48:54.196 --> 48:55.659
Want to get some air?

48:56.982 --> 48:57.931
Come on. 

49:05.915 --> 49:08.088
Cheers. You having a good time?

49:09.501 --> 49:10.996
Your batteries are low. 

49:11.710 --> 49:13.238
There's a switch. 

49:17.121 --> 49:19.294
Women are kind of hard to figure,
aren't they?

49:19.459 --> 49:21.086
Yes, they are. 

49:21.156 --> 49:24.835
Yeah, I guess you've had your share of
trying to figure them out. Sexual problems?

49:24.902 --> 49:26.878
- Excuse me?
- In your marriage. 

49:27.432 --> 49:30.750
Sexual problems. I mean, it's usually sexual
problems that make a marriage hit a reef. 

49:30.826 --> 49:33.161
No, we didn't have any sexual problems. 

49:34.284 --> 49:36.325
- No?
- No. 

49:38.863 --> 49:41.352
When we were dating,
she was hotter than Cleopatra. 

49:43.761 --> 49:45.421
That's probably
one of the reasons I married her. 

49:45.491 --> 49:46.986
When we were dating, 

49:47.156 --> 49:49.197
we did everything except it. 

49:49.558 --> 49:51.501
She said she didn't want to cheapen
the relationship. 

49:51.575 --> 49:54.675
Kept talking about saving it for marriage. 

49:54.936 --> 49:57.807
Then when we got married,
she wasn't interested. 

50:00.187 --> 50:03.091
She'd lie back, close her eyes and
think of England. 

50:03.390 --> 50:06.391
- I guess marriage is different than dating.
- Yeah. 

50:08.897 --> 50:11.484
You ever wonder why you weren't enough?

50:12.259 --> 50:13.275
Yes. 

50:17.671 --> 50:19.581
Cissy seem frigid to you?

50:20.648 --> 50:22.405
- Hard to say.
- Oh, come on, Jesse. 

50:22.473 --> 50:24.297
She embarrassed us both
out there on the dance floor. 

50:24.362 --> 50:25.824
She seem frigid to you then?

50:26.027 --> 50:27.010
No. 

50:27.083 --> 50:29.190
How come she's frigid at home
and hot with other guys?

50:29.646 --> 50:32.069
I'm a cop, Hasty. That's a shrink question. 

50:36.497 --> 50:38.157
Funny thing is

50:40.596 --> 50:42.320
I'm still in love with her. 

50:45.943 --> 50:47.602
Lou Carson's dead. 

50:49.273 --> 50:52.024
- What happened?
- Car accident. 

50:54.973 --> 50:56.730
He was looking forward so much
to his retirement. 

50:56.798 --> 50:59.003
Hell of a thing to happen
first day of his trip. 

50:59.071 --> 51:01.528
How do you know it happened
on the first day?

51:01.601 --> 51:04.024
Well, it was just an assumption I made. 

51:04.450 --> 51:07.387
- It's a good assumption.
- I was fond of Lou. 

51:12.103 --> 51:13.795
I was very fond of Lou. 

51:20.972 --> 51:25.830
- What do you do when you have groceries?
- Well, you carry them across the bridge. 

51:26.608 --> 51:28.202
It's charming. 

51:36.438 --> 51:39.637
- Boomer's not eating.
- It's just the new surroundings. 

51:39.927 --> 51:41.586
He'll be fine. 

51:42.394 --> 51:44.599
Any plans to furnish it at some point?

51:44.955 --> 51:46.712
That's a good idea. 

51:47.388 --> 51:50.107
There is a mattress in the bedroom. 

51:50.494 --> 51:51.836
Do you have a box spring?

51:51.903 --> 51:54.393
I just want to know
what I'm getting myself into. 

52:01.445 --> 52:04.196
That's Ozzie.
The best shortstop that ever lived. 

52:04.710 --> 52:07.014
- And that would be baseball?
- Yes. 

52:13.997 --> 52:15.045
Thank you. 

52:17.262 --> 52:19.849
Jesse, what's going on with you
and Joe Genest?

52:19.984 --> 52:23.761
No shrugging. I asked you a question.
I expect an answer. 

52:23.986 --> 52:25.481
Are you afraid of him?

52:25.555 --> 52:28.492
Joe is stupid and mean
and he doesn't like me. 

52:29.237 --> 52:30.612
On the other hand, 

52:30.742 --> 52:34.454
if I had to, I could shoot him just
as easily as if he were smart and kind. 

52:39.324 --> 52:41.365
<i>Hi, Jesse. Are you there?</i>

52:44.254 --> 52:46.394
You can pick that up if you want to. 

52:46.592 --> 52:48.960
<i>You said you were trying not to love me. </i>

52:50.595 --> 52:52.156
<i>Are you succeeding?</i>

52:54.469 --> 52:56.739
Well, that was just getting interesting. 

53:00.872 --> 53:02.629
Do you still love her?

53:03.691 --> 53:07.075
I'm not a good basket to put
all your eggs in at the moment. 

53:09.198 --> 53:11.021
Am I too young for you?

53:11.951 --> 53:14.670
Is that another way of saying
I'm too old for you?

53:15.858 --> 53:17.452
Come here. 

53:38.015 --> 53:39.292
How old is he?

53:39.776 --> 53:43.007
- Ten.
- Do you see that? Right there?

53:43.331 --> 53:46.944
That's polycystic renal disease.
His kidneys are failing. 

53:50.630 --> 53:52.038
What can we do?

53:52.232 --> 53:55.550
Well, nothing, I'm afraid.
It's often the kidneys that go first. 

53:57.323 --> 53:59.691
- Did you breed this dog?
- No. Why?

54:00.492 --> 54:03.342
He's not been neutered.
Any particular reason why?

54:08.049 --> 54:11.761
Somehow I didn't think Boomer
would be Boomer without testicles. 

54:12.692 --> 54:16.950
Oh, well, be that as it may,
the end won't be pretty. 

54:17.783 --> 54:21.779
I think you need to put him down.
It would be the right thing to do. 

55:11.896 --> 55:15.214
Paradise Women's Club. Makes me blush. 

55:15.514 --> 55:18.363
Maybe it's evolved
into a powerful force for feminism. 

55:18.780 --> 55:20.691
And maybe pigs fly. 

55:23.679 --> 55:25.273
- Did you see that?
- What?

55:26.144 --> 55:29.212
Did you see Cissy get all wiggly
listening to Joe?

55:29.730 --> 55:32.383
I'm telling you,
I think there's something there. 

55:32.484 --> 55:33.467
I don't see it. 

55:33.541 --> 55:35.484
I think he's plonking her. 

55:35.558 --> 55:37.381
- Plonking?
- Yeah. 

55:37.447 --> 55:39.106
And you can tell this just by looking?

55:39.176 --> 55:41.446
I can. I am wise in these matters. 

55:41.514 --> 55:42.659
And why is that?

55:42.730 --> 55:44.771
Because I am blessed with a penis. 

55:46.060 --> 55:48.069
Hey, Stone. How about a drink?

55:48.334 --> 55:52.711
Hey. Sorry I couldn't say hi
outside the vet's, but I was in a rush. 

55:53.072 --> 55:55.889
You're not following me around,
are you, Joe?

55:56.402 --> 55:59.306
- How're you doing, little lady?
- I'm fine. 

55:59.412 --> 56:00.657
Yes, you are. 

56:00.725 --> 56:01.806
What do you do, Joe?

56:01.878 --> 56:03.734
- What?
- For a living?

56:04.184 --> 56:06.771
I don't see how that's any of your business. 

56:07.674 --> 56:09.846
I was sorry to hear about Lou Carson. 

56:09.914 --> 56:11.028
What about him?

56:11.100 --> 56:12.529
He was killed. 

56:13.244 --> 56:15.188
Where were you when it happened?

56:15.261 --> 56:16.669
I got an alibi. 

56:16.734 --> 56:18.808
How do you know when he was killed?

56:18.976 --> 56:21.945
Whenever it happened, I didn't do it. 

56:22.018 --> 56:23.263
Do what?

56:23.554 --> 56:25.628
I don't got to listen to this crap. 

56:31.272 --> 56:33.378
How long have you known about this?

56:35.146 --> 56:36.390
How long?

56:39.628 --> 56:41.353
Couple of days. 

56:42.766 --> 56:46.084
You may like to stir the pot
and play your stupid little games, 

56:46.320 --> 56:48.777
but Lou Carson was a friend of mine. 

56:49.939 --> 56:53.553
And you should at least be honest
with someone who's sharing your bed. 

57:05.436 --> 57:06.451
Captain Healey. 

57:06.524 --> 57:08.827
It's Jesse.
Sorry we've been playing phone tag. 

57:08.895 --> 57:11.285
The lid's coming off on Lou Carson's death. 

57:11.360 --> 57:12.538
Thanks for letting me know. 

57:12.608 --> 57:14.268
We're still calling it an accident. 

57:14.338 --> 57:16.226
Is there a reason we shouldn't?

57:17.091 --> 57:20.060
I don't know.
Maybe I just like stirring the pot. 

57:20.261 --> 57:22.434
- Skipper?
- In a minute. 

57:22.662 --> 57:26.407
Listen, I need to talk to you, but I can't do it
on the phone. Can you come down here?

57:26.473 --> 57:28.099
<i>- I can.
- When?</i>

57:28.170 --> 57:29.665
- Today.
- Thanks. 

57:29.738 --> 57:30.917
Yeah. 

57:30.988 --> 57:32.396
D'Angelo. 

57:34.574 --> 57:36.036
What do you think?

57:40.113 --> 57:41.423
It's a good hat. 

57:41.938 --> 57:43.183
Here's your receipt. 

57:43.251 --> 57:45.554
Did you tell Hasty Hathaway
that Captain Healey

57:45.620 --> 57:47.727
was in my office a couple of days ago?

57:48.790 --> 57:53.648
Yeah. I saw him on the street, and
he was asking me how things were going. 

57:53.817 --> 57:55.192
It's a small town. 

57:55.418 --> 57:58.453
Well, here's an idea. Don't do that. 

57:58.845 --> 58:00.668
What happens here stays here. 

58:01.566 --> 58:05.463
If it happens again, I'll have your badge
and gun in my drawer. Understood?

58:06.241 --> 58:08.151
- Understood.
- Thanks for the hat. 

58:09.122 --> 58:10.585
You're welcome. 

58:11.172 --> 58:12.383
Suit!

58:16.359 --> 58:19.743
Come on in. It's okay. You're not in trouble. 

58:21.066 --> 58:24.417
- You practicing?
- Yes, I am. In a fight, front sight. 

58:25.292 --> 58:26.984
Sit down. 

58:27.054 --> 58:28.364
Jesse, can I ask you something?

58:28.430 --> 58:30.056
I was looking at this report. 

58:30.127 --> 58:33.959
You arrested Joe Genest
for assault and battery six months ago. 

58:34.162 --> 58:36.018
- Yes, sir.
- Jesse. 

58:36.435 --> 58:39.753
Jesse, Joe beat up this guy bad. 

58:40.373 --> 58:42.578
Well, no charges were filed. Why?

58:42.807 --> 58:44.269
That's the way Lou wanted it. 

58:44.344 --> 58:47.729
He said it was self-defense on Joe's part,
which was a load of crap. 

58:47.802 --> 58:50.007
Any idea why he might be
following me around?

58:50.075 --> 58:53.393
It might have something to do with
you kicking him in the nuts. 

58:54.911 --> 58:57.400
I think he's plonking Hasty's wife. 

58:57.472 --> 58:58.487
He is. 

58:59.521 --> 59:01.048
How do you know?

59:02.723 --> 59:04.382
What do you know about Cissy Hathaway?

59:04.452 --> 59:06.461
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean. 

59:06.533 --> 59:09.884
- I don't know anything about that.
- Am I missing something here?

59:09.959 --> 59:14.217
I ask you about Cissy Hathaway, and
you look like you just swallowed a squirrel. 

59:15.883 --> 59:17.029
Suit... 

59:18.540 --> 59:19.817
How do you know?

59:20.686 --> 59:23.754
I was plonking her
before Joe took my place. 

59:40.794 --> 59:42.999
Did I hear you call Luther "Suitcase"?

59:43.196 --> 59:44.985
- You did.
- Why?

59:46.077 --> 59:47.322
Why not?

59:47.390 --> 59:49.781
Do you ever give anybody
a straight answer?

01:00:09.259 --> 01:00:12.010
- Change your mind about lunch?
- No. 

01:00:12.076 --> 01:00:14.499
- We going to a different place?
- No. 

01:00:14.574 --> 01:00:17.096
- Would you prefer I didn't ask?
- Yes. 

01:00:37.308 --> 01:00:39.065
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes. 

01:00:39.133 --> 01:00:41.044
Why you following Joe Genest?

01:00:41.439 --> 01:00:42.934
Coply intuition. 

01:00:44.096 --> 01:00:45.439
What's he doing?

01:00:45.505 --> 01:00:46.880
I don't know. 

01:00:47.778 --> 01:00:50.780
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes. 

01:00:50.948 --> 01:00:53.699
- What do you think's in the bag?
- Money. 

01:00:54.566 --> 01:00:57.568
- That's good police work, Officer Crane.
- Thank you. 

01:01:03.372 --> 01:01:06.276
Assuming you're right about the bag
and it's not full of clothes, 

01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:08.620
I think our friend is laundering money. 

01:01:09.744 --> 01:01:11.850
So why is Hasty a son of a bitch?

01:01:13.522 --> 01:01:15.890
Lou didn't retire. Hasty forced him out. 

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:17.580
Why?

01:01:17.652 --> 01:01:18.830
I don't know. 

01:01:19.542 --> 01:01:20.851
Can you guess?

01:01:22.647 --> 01:01:24.404
I don't want to. 

01:01:25.978 --> 01:01:29.362
I think Joe Genest killed Lou
and made it look like an accident. 

01:01:29.691 --> 01:01:31.416
Because Lou knew about this?

01:01:32.894 --> 01:01:34.455
That would be a motive. 

01:01:36.736 --> 01:01:41.528
Unless Lou Carson's car could go sideways,
it wasn't an accident. 

01:01:43.236 --> 01:01:45.506
It was smashed in on the passenger side. 

01:01:45.798 --> 01:01:48.417
So obviously not a suicide
drive off the cliff. 

01:01:48.551 --> 01:01:50.854
Traffic found
an abandoned rental truck in town. 

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:54.817
Traces of paint on the front bumper
matched the paint on Lou Carson's car. 

01:01:55.275 --> 01:01:58.506
Rented under a phony name.
Driver's license didn't check out. 

01:01:58.765 --> 01:02:03.656
Anyway, we did pick up enough at the scene
to know he was pushed off. 

01:02:04.337 --> 01:02:05.996
His motor wasn't running. 

01:02:07.442 --> 01:02:08.904
You getting all this?

01:02:09.876 --> 01:02:11.371
You got a suspect?

01:02:12.053 --> 01:02:13.298
Not yet. 

01:02:13.366 --> 01:02:17.230
- How about you?
- I got a prospect. Guy named Joe Genest. 

01:02:18.489 --> 01:02:20.312
I know a guy named Joe Genest. 

01:02:20.379 --> 01:02:24.472
Bag man for Gino Fish,
who is a very prosperous businessman. 

01:02:25.534 --> 01:02:27.193
Drugs and gambling mostly. 

01:02:28.031 --> 01:02:31.677
He runs the South End and the Back Bay.
Why Joe Genest?

01:02:32.225 --> 01:02:33.753
He's following me around. 

01:02:33.827 --> 01:02:35.486
And why would he do that?

01:02:35.555 --> 01:02:37.214
'Cause he doesn't like me. 

01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:39.907
Jesse, 

01:02:40.454 --> 01:02:43.522
we've had Joe Genest
as a person of interest

01:02:43.592 --> 01:02:46.561
in about five mob killings. 

01:02:47.371 --> 01:02:49.063
We got nowhere. 

01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:52.137
I'd be a little careful if I were you. 

01:03:07.254 --> 01:03:09.622
- Where's Boomer?
- He's home. 

01:03:12.538 --> 01:03:14.099
I got some furniture. 

01:03:18.141 --> 01:03:21.110
Jesse, I think
that we're moving way too fast. 

01:03:23.584 --> 01:03:25.440
I think that I need some time. 

01:03:29.828 --> 01:03:31.356
I understand. 

01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:35.005
I'm sorry. 

01:04:12.350 --> 01:04:14.937
I got a surprise for you, Boomer. 

01:04:16.257 --> 01:04:17.784
Steak. 

01:04:40.782 --> 01:04:44.101
<i>Hi. It's me. Call me. </i>

01:04:57.561 --> 01:05:01.492
<i>So I'd be kind of like a hyphenate.
A pediatricianlmedical examiner. </i>

01:05:01.692 --> 01:05:03.481
Well, no offense, Doc, 

01:05:03.549 --> 01:05:07.348
I didn't know you were a pediatrician.
How about just medical examiner?

01:05:07.551 --> 01:05:09.691
I haven't seen a cadaver since med school. 

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:13.145
And you'll probably never see one.
Hell, nothing ever happens here. 

01:05:13.219 --> 01:05:16.898
I can get you an extra 500 bucks a month
and a nice title. 

01:05:17.157 --> 01:05:19.941
- Sounds like a challenge.
- There's one other thing. 

01:05:21.127 --> 01:05:23.649
I want you to put down my dog. 

01:05:23.721 --> 01:05:24.899
Excuse me?

01:05:24.969 --> 01:05:27.109
I want you to put down my dog. 

01:05:27.884 --> 01:05:29.445
Jesse, I can't do that. 

01:05:30.413 --> 01:05:33.317
For me to euthanize your dog
would be completely unethical. 

01:05:33.391 --> 01:05:34.406
Why?

01:05:34.479 --> 01:05:37.164
'Cause as a doctor,
I took an oath to do no harm. 

01:05:38.386 --> 01:05:40.940
I'm a people doctor, not an animal doctor. 

01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:42.384
Why don't you have the vet do it?

01:05:42.452 --> 01:05:44.276
Because I don't like her. 

01:05:46.614 --> 01:05:49.136
Look, if you could get your mind around it, 

01:05:50.137 --> 01:05:51.894
I'd consider it a favor. 

01:05:57.725 --> 01:06:00.181
- Hey, Suit.
- Hi. 

01:06:01.823 --> 01:06:03.647
- You got a second?
- Sure. 

01:06:06.146 --> 01:06:07.609
Where's Boomer?

01:06:08.195 --> 01:06:09.505
He's home. 

01:06:11.141 --> 01:06:12.669
Jesse, I got a problem. 

01:06:12.742 --> 01:06:14.499
I don't care about Cissy Hathaway. 

01:06:14.567 --> 01:06:15.910
No, it's not that. 

01:06:15.976 --> 01:06:17.984
Something's been bothering me. 

01:06:18.057 --> 01:06:20.547
I wasn't sure if I was supposed to ask and... 

01:06:22.124 --> 01:06:25.290
Maybe I'm supposed to know.
See, the thing is... 

01:06:25.358 --> 01:06:27.694
Why do you call me "Suitcase"?

01:06:27.759 --> 01:06:28.840
Why not?

01:06:28.912 --> 01:06:31.150
That's not funny, Jesse. 

01:06:31.217 --> 01:06:32.462
I'm sorry. 

01:06:32.530 --> 01:06:34.735
It's after Harry "Suitcase" Simpson. 

01:06:34.835 --> 01:06:36.942
- The baseball player.
- Why "Suitcase"?

01:06:37.141 --> 01:06:40.012
Because he was traded to a lot of teams.
He traveled a lot. 

01:06:40.087 --> 01:06:42.030
But I've lived here all my life. 

01:06:42.553 --> 01:06:44.758
Yeah, I know. Just seemed to fit. 

01:07:18.254 --> 01:07:19.881
How long you had him?

01:07:20.847 --> 01:07:22.539
Since he was a pup. 

01:07:44.894 --> 01:07:46.684
I went on the Internet. 

01:07:49.889 --> 01:07:51.646
Found out how to do this. 

01:07:54.884 --> 01:07:57.569
You can find out nearly anything
on the Internet. 

01:08:39.423 --> 01:08:41.049
I'm sorry, Jesse. 

01:08:42.273 --> 01:08:43.680
Thank you, Doc. 

01:09:27.068 --> 01:09:31.326
<i>Hi, Jesse.
Doc Perkins just told me about Boomer. </i>

01:09:32.255 --> 01:09:33.816
<i>Call me when you can. </i>

01:10:10.038 --> 01:10:12.079
I guess Lou was on the take. 

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:15.223
I think so. 

01:10:15.289 --> 01:10:17.112
You know, last night I was thinking. 

01:10:17.178 --> 01:10:20.409
About a year ago, Hasty kept coming
in and out of here as he pleased. 

01:10:20.475 --> 01:10:24.155
He used Lou's office... Sorry, your office. 

01:10:25.439 --> 01:10:28.507
Hasty's white-collar.
Doesn't figure he'd order a murder. 

01:10:29.217 --> 01:10:31.585
Can you prove that Joe Genest killed him?

01:10:32.739 --> 01:10:35.130
I got some evidence, but no proof. 

01:10:40.488 --> 01:10:42.344
This happened on my watch. 

01:10:46.604 --> 01:10:48.460
I gotta make something happen. 

01:10:52.847 --> 01:10:54.310
Where's Boomer?

01:10:57.971 --> 01:10:59.149
He's home. 

01:11:39.564 --> 01:11:41.736
- You got a cigarette?
- No. 

01:11:42.221 --> 01:11:44.044
- What, you don't smoke?
- No. 

01:11:44.783 --> 01:11:47.086
- You ever?
- No. 

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:49.424
- How come?
- I was a jock. 

01:11:49.713 --> 01:11:51.787
I didn't want it to affect my wind. 

01:11:52.115 --> 01:11:53.677
So, what are you doing here?

01:11:53.748 --> 01:11:55.275
I was waiting for you. 

01:11:55.958 --> 01:11:57.420
I talked to your mom. 

01:11:58.006 --> 01:11:59.534
She worries about you. 

01:12:00.665 --> 01:12:03.863
She said you took the divorce really hard,
that you hate your dad. 

01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:05.305
Well, I do. 

01:12:05.372 --> 01:12:06.867
Well, that's too bad. 

01:12:06.941 --> 01:12:09.593
- Fathers are important.
- Look, I don't want another lecture. 

01:12:09.662 --> 01:12:11.703
I'm not lecturing. I'm sharing. 

01:12:12.063 --> 01:12:14.879
- We have something in common.
- You hate your dad?

01:12:15.841 --> 01:12:18.428
No. But I've been through a divorce. 

01:12:19.075 --> 01:12:22.939
- You hate your ex-wife?
- Sometimes. But not all the time. 

01:12:23.014 --> 01:12:28.200
And I'm a better person when
I remember that I care about her. 

01:12:30.058 --> 01:12:32.164
Your dad's done some bad things. 

01:12:33.068 --> 01:12:34.498
Tell me about it. 

01:12:37.167 --> 01:12:38.629
To other people, too. 

01:12:42.097 --> 01:12:45.416
If something happens and you need to talk, 

01:12:46.804 --> 01:12:48.660
let me know. 

01:12:50.646 --> 01:12:52.054
I'll meet you here. 

01:13:04.735 --> 01:13:06.907
You gotta watch that drinking thing. 

01:13:07.777 --> 01:13:10.975
Oh, hey there, Chief, you following me?

01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:13.410
I asked you first. 

01:13:15.173 --> 01:13:16.701
So, how's Hasty's wife?

01:13:19.591 --> 01:13:20.639
Excuse me?

01:13:21.129 --> 01:13:22.853
What do you do, Joe?

01:13:24.939 --> 01:13:28.454
Guy drives a nice car,
pays cash for his house. I get curious. 

01:13:28.942 --> 01:13:30.950
Maybe you should stay that way. 

01:13:32.656 --> 01:13:34.762
You've done some bad things, Joe. 

01:13:35.025 --> 01:13:37.645
So throw me in jail. 

01:13:37.779 --> 01:13:39.122
Not tonight. 

01:13:41.333 --> 01:13:43.854
When's the last time you had sex
with a woman?

01:13:46.776 --> 01:13:48.632
None of your business. 

01:13:48.729 --> 01:13:51.000
Well, I think you should consider it. 

01:13:51.387 --> 01:13:53.691
'Cause it's going to be the last time. 

01:14:30.963 --> 01:14:33.004
- Hello.
- Hi, Hasty. 

01:14:33.076 --> 01:14:36.340
Sorry to bother you in the middle
of the night, but you said anytime. 

01:14:36.406 --> 01:14:38.895
<i>Listen, something's come up.
We have to talk. </i>

01:14:38.967 --> 01:14:41.074
- What's going on?
- Can it wait till morning?

01:14:41.145 --> 01:14:43.001
- Lf you say so, boss.
- What's going on?

01:14:43.066 --> 01:14:44.790
Right. I'll call you
first thing in the morning. 

01:14:44.859 --> 01:14:45.808
<i>Fine. </i>

01:15:24.435 --> 01:15:26.509
The son of a bitch has landed. 

01:15:30.775 --> 01:15:34.039
- I thought you were gonna call me.
- Well, you said it was urgent. 

01:15:34.105 --> 01:15:36.048
I'm sorry, boss, you said anytime. 

01:15:36.122 --> 01:15:37.879
- What's going on?
- Want some coffee?

01:15:37.948 --> 01:15:39.891
Coffee? No, I don't want coffee. 

01:15:43.743 --> 01:15:45.500
Lou Carson was murdered. 

01:15:46.593 --> 01:15:48.055
Murdered?

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:51.868
Well, I find that hard to believe. 

01:15:52.196 --> 01:15:55.165
You know what? I actually...
I will have some coffee. 

01:15:57.351 --> 01:16:00.135
Molly, can we have another cup of coffee?

01:16:00.425 --> 01:16:02.433
- You told me it was a car accident.
- I was wrong. 

01:16:02.506 --> 01:16:05.323
- Newspapers called it a car accident.
- That's what the police gave them. 

01:16:05.388 --> 01:16:08.139
- But you remember this guy Joe Genest?
- Joe Genest?

01:16:10.575 --> 01:16:12.943
Molly, close the door. 

01:16:15.282 --> 01:16:18.000
- You think Joe Genest killed Lou?
- I know it. 

01:16:18.067 --> 01:16:20.851
- How do you know it?
- I can't tell you. 

01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:25.807
Look, Hasty,
I know I owe you a lot but this... 

01:16:29.146 --> 01:16:31.831
All right. All right. 

01:16:32.413 --> 01:16:34.356
But this has to stay between us. 

01:16:34.493 --> 01:16:35.988
Yeah, of course, I understand. 

01:16:36.062 --> 01:16:38.846
Well, Healey found evidence
that Joe was at the scene. 

01:16:39.104 --> 01:16:41.724
Oh, he found it.
Why hasn't he arrested him, then?

01:16:41.794 --> 01:16:45.058
Well, they don't have enough to make
a case. They don't have a motive yet but... 

01:16:45.124 --> 01:16:48.125
See, I think I do. Joe works for the mob. 

01:16:48.197 --> 01:16:51.461
And I think he and Lou
had some kind of deal that went bad. 

01:16:53.641 --> 01:16:55.301
There's something else. 

01:16:57.388 --> 01:16:59.528
Joe's sleeping with your wife. 

01:17:02.735 --> 01:17:06.032
I think if he's arrested, it's gonna come out. 

01:17:09.011 --> 01:17:11.019
No one else knows about this. 

01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:16.110
I appreciate that you came
to me first with this. 

01:17:16.183 --> 01:17:18.770
I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you. 

01:17:21.594 --> 01:17:24.214
- I'll walk you out.
- Yeah. 

01:18:21.182 --> 01:18:22.393
I got it. 

01:18:27.746 --> 01:18:30.114
- Hello.
- Jesse, this is Hasty. Listen. 

01:18:30.179 --> 01:18:33.116
This thing has really thrown me
for a loop, and I need to talk. 

01:18:33.189 --> 01:18:35.296
I understand. I'll come to you, boss. 

01:18:35.367 --> 01:18:37.277
No, no. It's got to be somewhere private. 

01:18:37.351 --> 01:18:39.524
I don't want everybody to know about this. 

01:18:39.593 --> 01:18:41.766
<i>You know where that rusted ship is tied up?</i>

01:18:41.835 --> 01:18:43.811
- Yes.
- Tonight, 8:00. 

01:18:43.915 --> 01:18:46.218
- I'll be there.
- Good. Thanks. 

01:18:51.728 --> 01:18:53.617
He'll be there. 

01:18:54.258 --> 01:18:57.129
You got to talk to him in private
about what?

01:19:00.342 --> 01:19:03.093
Anything you want to say
to me there, Hasty?

01:19:04.696 --> 01:19:08.789
I don't think there is anything I could say
that'll make a difference, will it?

01:20:10.432 --> 01:20:12.669
I work for the mob and I kill people. 

01:20:12.738 --> 01:20:13.982
Excuse me?

01:20:14.626 --> 01:20:17.049
You asked what I do for a living. 

01:20:18.597 --> 01:20:20.453
Give me your gun. 

01:20:21.094 --> 01:20:22.371
No. 

01:20:24.328 --> 01:20:26.598
Put your hands behind your head. 

01:20:26.665 --> 01:20:27.910
No. 

01:20:28.651 --> 01:20:29.699
Excuse me?

01:20:30.508 --> 01:20:33.739
I'm not putting my hands behind my head.
I'm drinking coffee. 

01:20:34.318 --> 01:20:36.043
And you're gonna shoot me anyway. 

01:20:36.111 --> 01:20:38.054
That's a good point. 

01:20:53.082 --> 01:20:54.806
Is he dead?

01:20:54.874 --> 01:20:55.857
Yeah. 

01:20:55.931 --> 01:20:57.306
How do you know?

01:20:58.589 --> 01:20:59.800
You just know. 

01:21:06.241 --> 01:21:10.237
Tragically, Joe's ambitions
exceeded his abilities. 

01:21:10.596 --> 01:21:13.183
And it's one way
to keep him away from my wife. 

01:21:14.086 --> 01:21:15.713
You all right?

01:21:16.072 --> 01:21:17.829
Too soon to tell. 

01:21:25.229 --> 01:21:26.506
Oh, Hasty. 

01:21:27.694 --> 01:21:29.004
Yeah, I know. 

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:33.323
I was growing really fond of you, too.
I'm sorry to put you through this. 

01:21:33.394 --> 01:21:35.817
This? This is nothing. 

01:21:36.019 --> 01:21:37.995
I just had to bury my dog. 

01:21:39.125 --> 01:21:41.516
What'd you do, Hasty? See this in a movie?

01:21:41.783 --> 01:21:45.167
You shoot Joe with the Chief's gun.
And then you use his on me. 

01:21:45.785 --> 01:21:47.062
Pretty much. 

01:21:47.131 --> 01:21:52.316
Well, the problem is you might have trouble
explaining why Joe was shot in the back. 

01:21:56.672 --> 01:21:57.720
Oh, right. 

01:21:57.825 --> 01:22:00.444
You're out of your league, Hasty.
Don't do this. 

01:22:01.346 --> 01:22:03.257
I don't wanna see you get hurt. 

01:22:04.292 --> 01:22:05.952
I'm the one with the gun. 

01:22:06.118 --> 01:22:07.525
Not the only one. 

01:22:08.103 --> 01:22:09.860
Don't move a muscle, Hasty. 

01:22:16.011 --> 01:22:18.566
Oh, hell. No. 

01:22:20.366 --> 01:22:21.861
Just put it down. 

01:22:24.977 --> 01:22:26.352
<i>Did you get all that, Molly?</i>

01:22:26.417 --> 01:22:28.972
Tell the son of a bitch we got it all. 

01:22:36.216 --> 01:22:38.552
There's another one in his pocket. 

01:22:42.651 --> 01:22:44.343
I was ready, Jesse. 

01:22:44.861 --> 01:22:46.750
Sure you were, Suitcase. 

01:23:05.898 --> 01:23:07.426
Good God.
