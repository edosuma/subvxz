00:12.180 --> 00:13.306
(young Shawn)
DAD, DAD!

00:13.340 --> 00:14.568
DAD, DAD, DAD!

00:14.610 --> 00:16.077
WAIT, WHOA. SLOW DOWN.
SLOW DOWN. FIRE.

00:16.110 --> 00:17.372
DAD, YOU'LL NEVER
BELIEVE IT.

00:17.410 --> 00:20.243
I KNOW WHAT I WANNA BE
WHEN I GROW UP.

00:20.280 --> 00:21.349
A FIREMAN!

00:21.380 --> 00:24.543
I NEVER WOULDA GUESSED.
WHAT EXACTLY BROUGHT THIS ON?

00:24.590 --> 00:26.182
FIREMAN PAUL.
HE CAME TO OUR SCHOOL.

00:26.220 --> 00:28.256
HE IS SO TOTALLY RAD.

00:28.290 --> 00:31.179
FIREMAN PAUL?
DID HE HAPPEN TO BE SOBER?

00:31.230 --> 00:35.394
SHAWN, COME HERE.
LISTEN TO ME.

00:35.430 --> 00:38.763
YOU DO NOT
WANNA BE A FIREMAN.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.097
WHAT? WHY NOT?

00:40.140 --> 00:41.334
BECAUSE YOU WANNA BE A COP.

00:41.370 --> 00:43.099
WHAT DO YOU THINK I'VE BEEN
TEACHING YOU ALL THESE YEARS?

00:43.140 --> 00:45.199
BUT BEING A FIREMAN
IS THE COOLEST.

00:45.240 --> 00:47.208
BEING A FIREMAN IS NOT COOLER
THAN BEING A COP.

00:47.240 --> 00:49.242
WELL, THEY HAVE
COOLER UNIFORMS,

00:49.280 --> 00:51.100
COOLER TRUCKS,
AND COOLER SIRENS.

00:51.150 --> 00:53.277
THEY EVEN
GET TO CARRY AXES!

00:53.320 --> 00:54.412
AXES?

00:54.450 --> 00:56.839
I GET TO CARRY A GUN.
A REAL GUN, WITH REAL BULLETS.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.209
I GET TO SHOOT BAD GUYS.

00:58.250 --> 01:00.252
I'M LIKE DIRTY HARRY.

01:00.290 --> 01:01.848
CAN YOU EVEN NAME
A FAMOUS FIREMAN?

01:01.890 --> 01:03.619
SMOKEY THE BEAR?

01:03.660 --> 01:05.753
FIRST OF ALL, SMOKEY THE BEAR
IS NOT A FIREMAN.

01:05.790 --> 01:08.588
NUMBER TWO, HE'S NOT REAL.
NUMBER THREE, HE'S A BEAR.

01:08.630 --> 01:10.166
HE TAKES HIS POOPS
IN THE WOODS.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.167
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

01:11.200 --> 01:14.192
FIREMAN PAUL SAID
YOU'D SAY THAT.

01:19.210 --> 01:20.575
[imitates fire hose spraying]

01:20.610 --> 01:25.309
[imitates fire hose spraying]

02:14.230 --> 02:16.289
(Shawn)
WHAT IS GOING ON IN THERE?

02:16.330 --> 02:17.820
SHE NEVER CLOSES HER BLINDS.

02:17.870 --> 02:19.292
YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE
BEING OUT OF THE LOOP.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.432
(Juliet)
SHAWN, WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

02:20.470 --> 02:21.937
JULES.

02:21.970 --> 02:23.335
HOW 'BOUT AN UPDATE
ON THIS BLIND SITUATION?

02:23.370 --> 02:24.462
OH, JUST SOME CASE

02:24.510 --> 02:25.863
WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT
OR SOMETHING.

02:25.910 --> 02:27.229
FIRE DEPARTMENT?
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

02:27.280 --> 02:28.406
OF COURSE I DID.

02:28.440 --> 02:29.475
I'M STANDING 2 1/2 FEET
AWAY FROM HER.

02:29.510 --> 02:30.875
SO WHAT'S THE SCOOP?

02:30.910 --> 02:32.377
WELL, APPARENTLY

02:32.420 --> 02:33.842
SOME BUILDING BURNED DOWN
LAST WEEK ON BENEDETI'O

02:33.880 --> 02:36.314
UNDER SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES
AND THEY'RE LOOKING FOR BACKUP.

02:36.350 --> 02:37.817
SORRY, GUYS.
I GOTTA GO.

02:37.850 --> 02:42.287
DUDE, THAT'S US.
WE'RE BACKUP.
WHAT?

02:42.330 --> 02:43.319
(Conrad)
I STRONGLY BELIEVE--

02:43.360 --> 02:44.349
EXCUSE US.

02:44.390 --> 02:46.722
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR THE FIREMAN.

02:46.760 --> 02:47.829
HE'S PROBABLY WEARING
A YELLOW OR RED HARD HAT,

02:47.860 --> 02:50.658
MAYBE CARRYING AN AXE,
POSSIBLY A LARGE BUCKET OF SAND.

02:50.700 --> 02:53.260
AND A DALMATIAN.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.234
DISCOUNTING YOUR INTERRUPTION
TO A CLOSED-DOOR MEETING,

02:55.270 --> 02:56.407
MISS CONRAD
IS THE CITY'S

02:56.440 --> 02:57.634
ARSON INSPECTOR.

02:57.670 --> 02:59.831
ARSON.
MISS.
HELLO.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.939
ARSON. THAT'S FIRE?

03:01.980 --> 03:03.868
SHAWN SPENCER,
HEAD PSYCHIC, SBPD.

03:03.910 --> 03:05.605
I'M AVAILABLE.

03:05.650 --> 03:07.242
FOR CASES AS WELL.

03:07.280 --> 03:09.282
UM, I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT.

03:09.320 --> 03:11.914
I UNDERSTAND.
OBSESSIVE-COM PU LSIVE.

03:11.950 --> 03:12.882
(Vick)
IF YOU'RE FINISHED,
MR. SPENCER,

03:12.920 --> 03:14.478
WE'D LIKE TO PROCEED
WITH OUR MEETING, SO...

03:14.520 --> 03:15.851
AH, HOW RUDE
OF ME.

03:15.890 --> 03:17.323
I'D LIKE TO LOOK AT THE
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY FOR THAT AREA.

03:17.360 --> 03:19.590
I BELIEVE HER.
WHAT?

03:19.630 --> 03:20.995
I'M SENSING THAT LASSIE

03:21.030 --> 03:22.998
IS SKEPTICAL
THAT THIS IS ARSON.

03:23.030 --> 03:25.260
OF COURSE I'M SKEPTICAL,
SHE'S AN ARSON INVESTIGATOR,

03:25.300 --> 03:26.733
THEY ALWAYS WANT IT
TO BE ARSON.

03:26.770 --> 03:28.260
KEEPS THEIR JOB VIABLE.
CAN I GO NOW?

03:28.300 --> 03:29.437
ALL I NEED IS ACCESS
TO SOME OF YOUR FILES

03:29.470 --> 03:30.437
FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS.

03:30.470 --> 03:31.732
I CAN DO THAT FOR YOU.

03:31.770 --> 03:33.431
WHAT?
(Shawn)
COME ON, CHIEF.

03:33.480 --> 03:34.777
I KNOW WHERE THE FILE ROOM IS.

03:34.810 --> 03:35.879
BESIDES, WHEN
YOU GET DOWN THERE,

03:35.910 --> 03:38.003
THINGS CAN GET TRICKY,
SOME OF THOSE DRAWERS STICK.

03:38.050 --> 03:40.439
WHO GAVE YOU ACCESS
TO THE FILE ROOM?

03:40.480 --> 03:42.448
IRRELEVANT AND IMMATERIAL.

03:42.490 --> 03:43.616
CHIEF, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
LET HIM DO THAT THING

03:43.650 --> 03:44.617
WHERE HE ONLY USES
COURTROOM JARGON,

03:44.650 --> 03:46.311
ARE YOU?
MR. SPENCER--

03:46.360 --> 03:48.351
HE IS MAKING A MOCKERY
OF THESE PROCEEDINGS.

03:48.390 --> 03:49.948
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT

03:49.990 --> 03:52.458
SHE IS MAKING A VERY
COMPELLING ARGUMENT.
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.821
THAT'S LESS COMPELLING.
MOVE TO STRIKE.

03:54.860 --> 03:55.827
(Morgan)
PLEASE REMOVE HIM.

03:55.860 --> 03:58.465
SIDEBAR,
MISS CONRAD.

03:58.500 --> 03:59.762
I THINK I CAN HELP YOU.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.336
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHY I'M HERE.

04:01.370 --> 04:02.906
I'M SENSING SOMETHING HAPPENED
ON BENEDE'I'I'O STREET

04:02.940 --> 04:03.907
AND YOU'RE NOT GE'I'I'ING
THE SUPPORT YOU WANT

04:03.940 --> 04:05.407
FROM YOUR DEPARTMENT,

04:05.440 --> 04:06.839
AND YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
A LITTLE OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.973
THAT'S ACTUALLY
SPOT-ON.

04:09.010 --> 04:10.500
YES, I KNOW.

04:10.550 --> 04:13.644
CHIEF,
I BELIEVE WE HAVE A MATCH

04:13.680 --> 04:16.683
MADE IN HEAVEN.

04:16.720 --> 04:18.449
[indistinct voice
over police walkie-talkie]

04:18.490 --> 04:19.980
(Shawn)
CRAP.

04:20.020 --> 04:21.453
THIS PLACE IS LIKE,
COMPLETELY BURNED.

04:21.490 --> 04:22.889
(Gus)
IT'S CALLED A FIRE, SHAWN.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.785
AND IT'S ALL EVIDENCE,
SO DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING.

04:25.830 --> 04:28.321
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL TRY TO SPEAK SLOWLY.

04:28.360 --> 04:29.395
LET'S REVIEW.

04:29.430 --> 04:32.331
I BELIEVE THE FIRE STARTED
IN THIS GENERAL AREA,

04:32.370 --> 04:35.498
AND SPREAD
IN THIS DIRECTION.
(Army)
CONRAD.

04:35.540 --> 04:36.438
WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

04:36.470 --> 04:38.335
NOW YOU'RE DRAGGING
THE COPS DOWN HERE?

04:38.370 --> 04:39.735
AND THIS IS...

04:39.780 --> 04:42.476
ARMY JOHNSON,
FIRE PREVENTION BUREAU.

04:42.510 --> 04:44.341
AND YOUR SUPERVISOR,
IN CASE YOU FORGOT.

04:44.380 --> 04:46.371
WELL, IF THIS IS ARSON, THEN--

04:46.420 --> 04:47.717
LOOK. AT THE BUREAU,
WE HAVE A POLICY

04:47.750 --> 04:49.069
OF SUPPORTING
OUR ROOKIES.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.144
ROOKIES?

04:50.190 --> 04:52.556
SO I GAVE YOU A LOT
OF LATITUDE ON THIS CASE.

04:52.590 --> 04:53.818
I READ YOUR REPORT,

04:53.860 --> 04:55.714
AND I SURVEYED
THE SCENE MYSELF.

04:55.760 --> 04:58.979
IT LOOKS LIKE AN ACCIDENTAL FIRE
TO ME, NOT MALICIOUS ARSON.

04:59.030 --> 05:00.395
I RESPECT FULLY DISAGREE.

05:00.430 --> 05:02.421
HONEY,

05:02.470 --> 05:05.064
THE LAST TIME THIS CITY
HAD AN ARSONIST WAS SO LONG AGO

05:05.100 --> 05:07.364
I WAS STILL
ON THE BIG, RED TRUCK.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.334
BESIDES,
THIS BUILDING

05:09.370 --> 05:10.439
HAD NO FIRE INSURANCE.

05:10.470 --> 05:11.505
SO NO ONE PROFITS.

05:11.540 --> 05:13.428
A FIREBUG
DOESN'T NEED A MOTIVE.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.471
YEAH, ENOUGH.

05:15.510 --> 05:17.501
JUST FINISHOYl-(IDUR REPORT.

05:17.550 --> 05:19.711
NOW I'M LATE FOR
MY HOT YOGA CLASS.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.415
I'M TEACHING THIS YEAR.

05:24.120 --> 05:25.382
AN ACCIDENT?

05:25.420 --> 05:27.911
IS THERE SOMETHING
WE'RE MISSING, HERE?

05:27.960 --> 05:29.427
WELL, WE DID FIND SOME

05:29.460 --> 05:31.382
EMPTY LIQUOR BO'I'I'LES
AND CIGARETTE BU'I'I'S

05:31.430 --> 05:32.522
AROUND THE FIRE'S POINT
OF ORIGIN, BUT--

05:32.560 --> 05:34.448
AND WE'VE HAD SEVERAL REPORTS

05:34.500 --> 05:36.092
OF TEENAGERS LOOKING
FOR PLACES TO PARTY.

05:36.130 --> 05:37.358
I THINK LASSIE'S
ON TO SOMETHING.

05:37.400 --> 05:40.062
HAVE WE RULED OUT TEENAGERS
WHO MEET IN ABANDONED BUILDINGS

05:40.100 --> 05:41.465
AND MAKE BANANAS FOSTER?

05:41.500 --> 05:43.809
(Morgan)
IT IS NOT TEENAGERS.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.034
ONE OF THE FIREMEN
REMEMBERS

05:45.070 --> 05:47.777
SMELLING A DISTINCT SWEET ODOR
WHILE PUTTING OUT THE FIRE,

05:47.810 --> 05:49.539
AND THAT IS A SIGN

05:49.580 --> 05:50.740
OF A STRONGER ACCELERANT
THAN ALCOHOL.

05:50.780 --> 05:55.114
AND IF THIS IS A FIREBUG,
HE IS JUST GETTING STARTED.

05:55.150 --> 05:58.608
DUDE. THAT WALL OVER THERE
DOESN'T HAVE ANY INSULATION.

05:58.650 --> 06:01.448
I THINK THAT'S
AN EXTERNAL WALL.

06:01.490 --> 06:03.526
LOOK, IF NO ONE FROM
YOUR DEPARTMENT IS ON BOARD,

06:03.560 --> 06:05.585
I'M ON BOARD!

06:11.900 --> 06:14.869
GUS, WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?

06:14.900 --> 06:16.458
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

06:16.510 --> 06:18.535
THERE'S SOMETHING OFF
WITH THIS WALL RIGHT HERE.

06:18.570 --> 06:20.606
I CAN FEEL IT.

06:20.640 --> 06:21.777
[sigh]

06:21.810 --> 06:22.902
(Morgan)
OH, MY GOD.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.042
(Gus)
WHAT THE...

06:24.080 --> 06:26.969
(Shawn)
DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.

06:27.020 --> 06:30.114
MISS CONRAD,
THIS WASN'T JUST ARSON.

06:30.150 --> 06:33.051
IT WAS MURDER.

06:33.090 --> 06:36.059
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

06:36.090 --> 06:40.550
*

06:40.600 --> 06:44.024
* IN BETWEEN THE LINES
THERE'S A LOT OF OBSCURITY *

06:44.070 --> 06:46.868
* I'M NOT INCLINED
TO RESIGN TO MATURITY *

06:46.900 --> 06:50.461
* IF IT'S ALL RIGHT,
THEN YOU'RE ALL WRONG *

06:50.510 --> 06:55.470
* BUT WHY BOUNCE AROUND
TO THE SAME DAMN SONG *

06:55.510 --> 07:00.618
* YOU'D RATHER RUN
WHEN YOU CAN'T CRAWL *

07:00.650 --> 07:04.711
* I KNOW YOU KNOW
THAT I'M NOT TELLING THE TRUTH *

07:04.750 --> 07:08.083
* I KNOW YOU KNOW
THEY JUST DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF *

07:08.120 --> 07:11.886
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION,
LEARN HOW TO BEND *

07:11.930 --> 07:22.738
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS TEND
TO PSYCH YOU OUT IN THE END *

07:22.770 --> 07:27.833
I'M SENSING THAT THIS MAN...
IS IT A MAN?

07:27.880 --> 07:29.768
I DON'T--
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

07:29.810 --> 07:31.903
YES, BASED ON THE PELVIC GIRDLE.

07:31.950 --> 07:33.918
BURNED TO DEATH.
HELL OF A WAY TO GO.

07:33.950 --> 07:35.178
HE DIDN'T BURN TO DEATH.

07:35.220 --> 07:36.949
M.E. PULLED A .22 SLUG
OUT OF HIS STERNUM.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.082
HE WAS SHOT, THEN BURNED?

07:38.120 --> 07:39.656
IT'S SAD,

07:39.690 --> 07:42.158
BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY DO
TO GUYS WHO WEAR GIRDLES.

07:42.190 --> 07:44.579
THIS MAN IS THE REASON
THE FIRE WAS SET.

07:44.630 --> 07:45.688
ACCORDING TO THE M.E.'S
PRELIMINARY REPORT,

07:45.730 --> 07:47.925
THE BULLET ENTERED THE BODY
AT A DOWNWARD TRAJ ECTORY,

07:47.960 --> 07:50.724
BASED ON BONE FRAGMENTS
CONTAINING LEAD RESIDUE.

07:50.770 --> 07:53.739
SEE, SO FROM BEHIND AND DOWNWARD
MEANS OUR SHOOTER

07:53.770 --> 07:54.839
OW!
DROPPED HIM
DOWN ON HIS KNEES,

07:54.870 --> 07:56.132
POPPED HIM EXECUTION STYLE.

07:56.170 --> 07:57.933
BANG.

07:57.970 --> 07:59.779
YOU TRIM THAT FINGERNAIL,
MING THE MERCILESS.

07:59.810 --> 08:01.209
THEN THE KILLER
TORCHED THE BUILDING

08:01.240 --> 08:03.071
TO MAKE THE BODY
UNIDENTIFIABLE.

08:03.110 --> 08:05.670
(Juliet)
OR TO REMOVE ANY TRACE
OF HIS OWN FINGERPRINTS OR DNA.

08:05.710 --> 08:07.075
WE COULDN'T EVEN PULL
A PRINT OFF THE BULLET.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.144
SMART MOVE.

08:08.180 --> 08:09.215
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT,
DETECTIVE,

08:09.250 --> 08:10.888
THIS IS MY
"I TOLD YOU SO" FACE.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.888
(Shawn)
WHICH IS KIND OF HARD
TO DISTINGUISH

08:12.920 --> 08:14.956
FROM YOUR "I THOUGHT THIS
WAS GONNA BE A NEW EPISODE

08:14.990 --> 08:16.719
"OF LAW AND ORDE BUT TURNS OUT
IT'S A REPEAT" FACE.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.022
(Lassiter)
A DEAD BODY
CHANGES THINGS.

08:18.060 --> 08:19.789
THAT'S HIS E-MAIL SIGNATURE.

08:19.830 --> 08:21.957
SO, WE'RE ON BOARD.
AND BECAUSE IT'S A HOMICIDE,

08:22.000 --> 08:23.160
IT'S OUR INVESTIGATION.

08:23.200 --> 08:24.565
NO, IT'S ARSON.

08:24.600 --> 08:25.692
AND I'VE ALREADY
BRIEFED ARMY ON ALL OF THIS.

08:25.730 --> 08:29.234
HE SAYS IT'S MY CASE,
I'M ON POINT, YOU REPORT TO ME.

08:29.270 --> 08:30.237
LOOK, WHEN WE FIND
OUR MURDERER,

08:30.270 --> 08:31.760
YOU'LL FIND YOUR ARSONIST.

08:31.810 --> 08:33.801
NO, WHEN I FIND MY ARSONIST,
I'LL FIND YOUR MURDERER.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.831
NO.
GUYS, PLEASE.

08:35.880 --> 08:36.949
CAN'T WE COME UP WITH A TERM

08:36.980 --> 08:39.005
THAT COVERS BOTH
KILLER AND ARSONIST?

08:39.050 --> 08:42.110
HOW ABOUT ARSASSIN?

08:42.150 --> 08:44.186
THE SKELETON HAD TRACE AMOUNTS
OF METHYLBENZENE

08:44.220 --> 08:45.414
THE PRIMARY COMPONENT
OF TNT.

08:45.450 --> 08:49.011
YOU CAN GET IT AT ANY HARDWARE
STORE, AND IT HAS A SWEET ODOR.

08:49.060 --> 08:51.620
ALL RIGHT, FINE. BUT NO ONE
OUTSIDE THIS ROOM CAN KNOW

08:51.660 --> 08:52.797
WE RECOVERED A SKELETON.

08:52.830 --> 08:54.127
AND MAKE SURE THE CITY
TREATS THE SITE

08:54.160 --> 08:54.899
LIKE AN ACCIDENT,
ALL RIGHT?

08:54.930 --> 08:55.498
ALL RIGHT,
I WANT OUR KILLER--

08:55.530 --> 08:56.667
(Shawn)
ARSASSIN!

08:56.700 --> 08:57.667
OR KARSONIST.

08:57.700 --> 08:59.839
ARSASSIN .

08:59.870 --> 09:01.599
I WANT THE KILLER
TO FEEL SAFE,

09:01.640 --> 09:02.902
I WANT HIM TO THINK
THAT HIS PLAN WORKED.

09:02.940 --> 09:05.101
SECONDLY, THE KEY
TO SOLVING THIS CASE

09:05.140 --> 09:08.701
IS TO FIGURE OUT
WHO THIS GUY WAS.

09:08.740 --> 09:10.549
COME HERE OFTEN?

09:14.380 --> 09:15.711
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD AFFORD
TO SLOW DOWN A LITTLE.

09:15.750 --> 09:17.217
YOU WALK ANY FASTER,

09:17.250 --> 09:19.286
YOU'RE GONNA
TRAVEL THROUGH TIME.

09:19.320 --> 09:20.252
SO WHAT'S
OUR NEXT MOVE?

09:20.290 --> 09:21.587
WELL, I ASSUME WE'RE
GONNA TEAM UP, RIGHT?

09:21.620 --> 09:23.326
TRAVEL CROSS-COUNTRY

09:23.360 --> 09:24.258
SOLVING MYSTERI ES,

09:24.290 --> 09:25.655
MAYBE SET UP SHOP
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,

09:25.690 --> 09:27.191
FORM A BLUEGRASS TRIO.

09:27.230 --> 09:29.357
LOOK. I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS
GETTING THE COPS

09:29.400 --> 09:31.322
TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY,
BUT YOU DON'T

09:31.370 --> 09:32.598
HAVE A LOT
OF EXPERIENCE WITH THIS,

09:32.640 --> 09:33.766
SO I PREFER
TO HANDLE POINT ALONE.

09:33.800 --> 09:38.203
YOU KNOW, SUN TZU SAYS THAT
TEAMWORK CAN BE VERY SENSUAL--

09:38.240 --> 09:41.232
I'LL E-MAIL YOU
THE REST!

09:41.280 --> 09:43.669
I'D GO AFTER HER IF SHE WASN'T
WALKING AT COUGAR SPEEDS.

09:43.710 --> 09:45.371
RIGHT.
SO WHAT'RE WE DOING?

09:45.410 --> 09:46.877
ARE WE REALLY DONE?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.649
GUS, DON'T BE WILLIAM ZABKA
FROM BACK TO SCHOOL.

09:48.680 --> 09:49.476
WE NEED TO GET IN

09:49.520 --> 09:50.646
WITH THE FIREMEN
THAT PUT OUT THE FIRE.

09:50.690 --> 09:51.816
SHOTGUN ON FIRE POLE.

09:51.850 --> 09:53.317
YOU CAN'T CALL SHOTGUN
ON A FIRE POLE.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.782
AND WHY THEM?

09:54.820 --> 09:56.310
I THINK WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A FIREMAN.

09:56.360 --> 09:57.679
SOMEONE WHO KNOWS FIRES

09:57.730 --> 09:58.924
SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THE SYSTEM.

09:58.960 --> 09:59.892
THEY STARTED THE FIRE
SOMEWHERE ELSE,

09:59.930 --> 10:01.750
THEN MOVED THE FLAMES
TOWARDS THE VICTIM.

10:01.800 --> 10:04.792
BECAUSE THE FIRST THING
AN ARSON INSPECTOR LOOKS FOR

10:04.830 --> 10:06.388
IS A POINT OF ORIGIN.
OKAY.

10:06.430 --> 10:08.091
HOW IN THE WORLD
DO YOU KNOW ALL THAT?

10:08.140 --> 10:09.767
I RODE THE BACKDRAFT RIDE
AT UNIVERSAL STUDIOS

10:09.810 --> 10:11.266
LIKE 74 TIMES.

10:11.310 --> 10:13.369
SHAWN, YOU CAN'T BASE
A WHOLE THEORY ON A MOVIE.

10:13.410 --> 10:14.729
THERE'S A MOVIE?

10:18.980 --> 10:23.679
[indistinct voice
over loudspeaker]

10:23.720 --> 10:25.415
NOW, WHEN WE GET IN HERE,

10:25.450 --> 10:26.678
DON'T DO THAT THING YOU USED
TO DO WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

10:26.720 --> 10:27.948
HI, FIREMAN.

10:27.990 --> 10:28.957
HELP YOU?

10:28.990 --> 10:30.878
SHAWN SPENCER.

10:30.930 --> 10:32.329
HUNTING AN ARSONIST.

10:32.360 --> 10:33.327
STEP ANTHONY, WALLY ALI.

10:33.360 --> 10:34.896
CAT STUCK IN A TREE.

10:34.930 --> 10:38.923
OH, CONRAD TOLD ME ABOUT YOU.
THE PSYCHO.

10:38.970 --> 10:39.959
PSYCHIC.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.695
BUT BEFORE WE GET
DOWN TO BUSINESS,

10:41.740 --> 10:43.298
UH, IS FIREMAN PAUL AROUND?

10:43.340 --> 10:45.069
WE HEARD HE USED
TO WORK OUTTA HERE

10:45.110 --> 10:46.065
BACK IN THE DAY.

10:46.110 --> 10:47.771
(Gus)
WE JUST WANNA SAY HELLO.

10:47.810 --> 10:49.072
HE CAME TO OUR SCHOOL
WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

10:49.110 --> 10:50.077
NO, WE'RE SURE
HE'D REMEMBER US.

10:50.110 --> 10:51.077
GUS ACCIDENTALLY
PEED ON HIM,

10:51.110 --> 10:53.044
AND I GAVE HIM IMPETIGO.

10:53.080 --> 10:55.742
OVER HERE.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.840
DIED FIGHTING
THE RENKEL FIRES OF '98.

10:58.890 --> 11:00.152
SET BY A BUNCH OF VANDALS.

11:00.190 --> 11:01.817
SO YOU THINK
IT'S ARSON, TOO.

11:01.860 --> 11:02.986
YOU BEEN CANOODLING
WITH CONRAD?

11:03.030 --> 11:05.021
IS CONRAD A CANOODLER?

11:05.060 --> 11:05.719
DID SHE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ME?

11:05.760 --> 11:07.694
CAN I GET HER NOTE
THROUGH YOU?

11:07.730 --> 11:09.254
I'M NOT SURE I LIKE
RANDOM PEOPLE INTERROGATING

11:09.300 --> 11:11.860
MY MEN, ESPECIALLY
BASED ON PSYCHIC HOKUM.

11:11.900 --> 11:13.128
HOKUM?

11:13.170 --> 11:15.798
WELL, THAT "HOKUM" FOUND TRACES
OF METHYLBENZENE AT THE SCENE.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.000
REALLY?

11:17.040 --> 11:19.008
YEAH, SO MY COLLEAGUE
WOULD LIKE TO TRY

11:19.040 --> 11:21.076
AND GLEAN MORE "HOKUM"
FROM YOUR MEN.

11:21.110 --> 11:23.999
LISTEN, IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY,
MY SHIFT IS OVER. MANETTI!

11:24.050 --> 11:26.439
MANETTI'S MY RIGHT-HAND MAN.

11:26.480 --> 11:27.913
THESE GUYS ARE HERE
ABOUT THE FIRE.

11:27.950 --> 11:28.974
DEAL WITH IT, WOULD YA?

11:29.020 --> 11:30.908
(Gus)
SO.

11:30.950 --> 11:32.713
YOU WERE THE GUYS WHO PUT OUT
THE FIRE A WEEK AGO?

11:32.760 --> 11:34.250
THAT WAS US.
THANKS TO MANETTI, HERE.

11:34.290 --> 11:35.450
WELL, THAT'S A GIVEN.

11:35.490 --> 11:37.924
YOU DON'T LOOK OLD ENOUGH
TO OPERATE A HOSE.

11:37.960 --> 11:41.020
WE DOUSED THAT FIRE
IN 33 MINUTES.

11:41.060 --> 11:42.152
REALLY?

11:42.200 --> 11:43.997
YOU KNOW, DOMINO'S CAN STILL
GET YOU A PIZZA IN UNDER 30.

11:44.030 --> 11:45.224
THAT MIGHT BE
MORE IMPRESSIVE.

11:45.270 --> 11:46.965
YEAH?
WELL, YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN

11:47.000 --> 11:48.991
HOW FAST I BOOKED THE PERPS
BACK IN MY COP DAYS.

11:49.040 --> 11:50.769
[whistles]

11:50.810 --> 11:52.038
WOW, WELL WE'RE
POLICE-AFFILIATED TOO,

11:52.070 --> 11:53.731
SO CAN WE ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS?

11:53.780 --> 11:55.202
WE DON'T HAVE TIME.
STARTING TRAINING DRILLS.

11:55.240 --> 11:56.798
PERFECT. WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO DO THEM WITH YOU.

11:56.850 --> 11:59.944
REALLY?
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

11:59.980 --> 12:01.174
YEAH, IT SOUNDED WEIRD
TO US TOO,

12:01.220 --> 12:02.881
BUT IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT
WE GET THIS INFORMATION

12:02.920 --> 12:04.478
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,
IT'S A HEADQUARTERS THING.

12:04.520 --> 12:06.909
LOOK, BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

12:06.960 --> 12:08.359
THERE'S NOTHING
WE'D RATHER DO LESS,

12:08.390 --> 12:09.880
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST GRAB US
A COUPLE OF THESE COSTUMES

12:09.930 --> 12:11.056
AND WE'LL GET IT
OVER WITH.

12:11.090 --> 12:12.284
YOU MEAN UNIFORMS.

12:12.330 --> 12:13.922
I'VE HEARD IT BOTH WAYS.

12:13.960 --> 12:15.291
CAN I RING THE BELL?

12:19.970 --> 12:22.268
[chaotic shouting]

12:22.300 --> 12:24.803
(man)
MOVE! MOVE!
COME ON! COME ON!

12:24.840 --> 12:26.034
GET MOVING DOWNHILL!

12:26.070 --> 12:27.833
THIS WAY!
YOU'RE GOING DOWN HILL!

12:27.880 --> 12:28.835
MOVE IT, MOVE IT!

12:28.880 --> 12:30.848
SO HOW MANY PEOPLE DID YOU PULL
OUT OF THE FIRE?

12:30.880 --> 12:32.939
NONE! BUILDING WAS EMPTY.
KEEP MOVING! MOVE IT! MOVE IT!

12:32.980 --> 12:33.912
(man)
GO, GO, GO!

12:33.950 --> 12:36.077
DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING
WEIRD ABOUT THE FIRE

12:36.120 --> 12:37.940
BESIDES THE SMELL? OH!

12:37.990 --> 12:41.050
LOTTA OPEN SPACES. NO FURNITURE
CLUTTERING UP THE JOINT.

12:41.090 --> 12:45.083
HEY! THIS ISN'T A PICNIC!
MOVE! GO, GO, GO, GO!

12:51.330 --> 12:55.096
NOPE, I DIDN'T SEE ANYONE
SUSPICIOUS IN THE CROWD.

12:55.140 --> 12:56.095
WOO!

12:56.140 --> 12:57.835
I QUESTIONED HIM
ALREADY, SHAWN.

12:57.870 --> 12:59.303
DUDE, HE WAS DOING
THE POLE.

12:59.340 --> 13:01.205
DID ANYONE MISS
THEIR SHIFT THAT NIGHT?

13:01.240 --> 13:04.300
NO. NO ONE WANTS
TO LOSE OUT ON THE O.T.

13:04.350 --> 13:06.306
ANYBODY HERE
WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD?

13:06.350 --> 13:08.341
SHH! NO TALKING.
IT KILLS THE ILLUSION.

13:08.380 --> 13:09.813
(Gus)
HOW MUCH MORE OF THIS
DO I HAVE TO TAKE?

13:11.390 --> 13:14.109
MAN, IN ORDER FOR HIM
TO STAY CERTIFIED IN CPR,

13:14.160 --> 13:15.388
HE HAS TO PRACTICE
ON A LIVE PERSON.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.479
HE'S GONNA USE A TONGUE GUARD
WHEN HE GIVES YOU MOUTH-TO-MOUTH

13:17.530 --> 13:19.521
SO IT'S NOT EVEN
REALLY LIKE KISSING.
WHAT?

13:19.560 --> 13:21.528
IF YOU FIND YOURSELF BECOMING
AROUSED, DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.061
YOU MUST BE OUTTA
YOUR DAMN MIND.

13:23.100 --> 13:25.421
[fire bell ringing]

13:25.470 --> 13:26.892
[siren sounding]

13:26.940 --> 13:28.066
EVERYBODY MOVE IT!

13:28.100 --> 13:30.068
THIS ISN'T PART OF THE DRILL,
LET'S GO!

13:30.110 --> 13:31.600
NO, SHAWN.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.005
THE ARSONIST MIGHT
STILL BE THERE.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.268
AND WE'RE ALREADY GEARED UP.

13:34.310 --> 13:36.005
THEY WON'T EVEN KNOW
I'M DRIVING THE TRUCK!

13:36.040 --> 13:37.075
WE SHOULD STAY HERE.
GET SOME GELATO,

13:37.110 --> 13:37.974
AND READ
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT'S REPORTS

13:38.010 --> 13:40.149
FROM THE COMFORT
OF OUR NOT-ON-FIRE OFFICE.

13:40.180 --> 13:41.078
DUDE, IF WE GO,

13:41.120 --> 13:43.941
YOU CAN DRIVE BEHIND
A SPEEDING FIRE TRUCK.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.343
ALL RIGHT.
REPEAT AFTER ME:

13:45.390 --> 13:47.085
WE ARE NOT GOING
INTO A BURNING BUILDING.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.610
WE ARE NOT-NOT GOING
INTO A BURNING BUILDING.

13:48.660 --> 13:52.027
BREAK!

13:52.060 --> 13:55.848
[sirens]

13:55.900 --> 14:00.269
[fire roaring]

14:05.370 --> 14:07.031
(Shawn)
HEY!

14:07.080 --> 14:08.035
THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOUR SHIFT WAS OVER.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.035
I HEARD ABOUT IT
ON MY SCANNER.

14:09.080 --> 14:10.399
WHAT IS THIS,
HALLOWEEN?

14:10.450 --> 14:12.372
WHY, YOU GOT CANDY?
I'LL TAKE SOME GOOD & PLENTY.

14:12.410 --> 14:13.377
OR GOOD & FRUITY.

14:13.420 --> 14:14.375
(Gus)
HOW BAD IS IT
IN THERE?

14:14.420 --> 14:15.512
I HAVEN'T BEEN INSIDE.

14:15.550 --> 14:16.539
I'M PATROLLING
THE SCENE FROM OUT HERE.

14:16.580 --> 14:18.047
SO JUST TRY TO STAY
OUTTA THE WAY, ALL RIGHT?

14:18.090 --> 14:19.341
THIS IS COMMAND.
FIRST FLOOR IS SECURE.

14:19.390 --> 14:21.449
I'M SENDING MORE MEN
TO THE SECOND FLOOR.

14:21.490 --> 14:23.549
ALPHA SIDE OVER.

14:23.590 --> 14:25.228
NO, SHAWN, WE'RE NOT GOING
INTO A BURNING BUILDING.

14:25.260 --> 14:26.056
YOU PROMISED.

14:26.090 --> 14:27.523
ACTUALLY,
I DIDN'T.
YES, YOU DID.

14:27.560 --> 14:28.458
THE FIRST FLOOR IS SECURE.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.297
THOSE THINGS
FLARE BACK UP ALL THE TIME.

14:30.330 --> 14:31.661
AND YOU KNOW HOW
FIRE'S ATTRACTED TO ME.

14:31.700 --> 14:33.236
CAN YOU BLAME IT?

14:33.270 --> 14:34.134
MAN, LOOK AT YOU.

14:34.170 --> 14:36.195
BLAIR UNDERWOOD CAN'T
TOUCH YOU RIGHT NOW.

14:36.240 --> 14:38.037
BLAIR UNDERWOOD NEVER PLAYED
A FIREMAN, EITHER.

14:38.070 --> 14:40.072
EXACTLY. COME ON.
I NEED THE SUPER SNIFFER.

14:40.110 --> 14:42.032
SHAWN!

14:42.080 --> 14:43.968
THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA,
SHAWN.

14:44.010 --> 14:45.671
SHAWN!

14:45.710 --> 14:50.010
DAMMIT.
I-I DON'T KNOW.

14:50.050 --> 14:53.019
MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY, UH--

14:53.060 --> 14:54.413
GUS, WHERE ARE YOU?

14:54.460 --> 14:56.155
(Gus)
DOWN HERE!

14:56.190 --> 14:58.124
THE KEY IS TO STAY
UNDERNEATH THE SMOKE!

14:58.160 --> 15:01.095
WOULD YOU GET UP?

15:01.130 --> 15:05.590
START SNIFFING!

15:05.630 --> 15:07.097
THERE'S SOMETHING SWEET
IN THE AIR!

15:07.140 --> 15:09.358
I NEED TO SEE WHAT
THE CEILING LOOKED LIKE

15:09.400 --> 15:13.678
BEFORE IT WAS SCORCHED!

15:13.710 --> 15:15.177
[ceiling collapses]

15:21.150 --> 15:23.641
ANYTHING ELSE?

15:23.690 --> 15:26.284
NOPE.
WE'RE GOOD.

15:33.330 --> 15:35.150
IN ALL THE YEARS
OF FIGHTING FIRES,

15:35.200 --> 15:38.499
THAT WAS THE DUMBEST THING
I HAVE EVER SEEN!

15:38.530 --> 15:42.569
IF I WAS STILL A COP,
I'D PUT YOU BOTH IN JAIL!

15:42.600 --> 15:46.263
I DEFINITELY SMELLED SOMETHING.

15:46.310 --> 15:48.107
THIS FIRE WAS
NOT AN ACCIDENT.

15:48.140 --> 15:50.199
I'LL DO YOU ONE BETTER.

15:50.250 --> 15:51.046
THE CHIEF HAD FLAKES

15:51.080 --> 15:53.310
OF THE UNBURNED CEILING
IN HIS HAIR.

15:53.350 --> 15:55.409
HE WAS IN THERE
BEFORE THE FIRE STARTED.

15:55.450 --> 15:57.179
WE'VE FOUND OUR ARSONURDERER.

15:57.220 --> 15:58.482
WHAT?

15:58.520 --> 16:01.284
FIREARSMEN.

16:01.320 --> 16:02.514
UH-UH.

16:02.560 --> 16:05.688
SENOR PANTALONES DE FUEGO?

16:14.300 --> 16:15.528
YOUR PSYCHIC HUNCH
WAS RIGHT, SHAWN.

16:15.570 --> 16:19.165
THIS BODY WAS FOUND IN A WALL
SPACE AT THE SITE OF THE FIRE.

16:19.210 --> 16:21.428
YES. I COULD SENSE THAT
THE FIRES WERE RELATED,

16:21.480 --> 16:23.744
AND SINCE THE FIRST ONE
WAS SET TO COVER UP MURDER--

16:23.780 --> 16:26.669
THERE MIGHT BE A BODY
AT THE SECOND FIRE TOO.

16:26.710 --> 16:27.711
[mumbles] NICE WORK.

16:27.750 --> 16:29.274
I'M SORRY?

16:29.320 --> 16:30.719
IT WAS EITHER
"NICE WORK" OR "ICE FORK,"

16:30.750 --> 16:31.614
BUT I COULDN'T TELL WHICH.

16:31.650 --> 16:33.311
(Juliet)
ACCORDING TO THE M.E.'S REPORT,

16:33.360 --> 16:35.783
THERE'S A UNIQUE
PURPLE RUBBER

16:35.820 --> 16:37.253
MELTED IN BETWEEN
THE VICTIM'S TOES.

16:37.290 --> 16:38.484
UNIQUE HOW?

16:38.530 --> 16:40.054
IT HAS REAL SPECKS
OF GOLD IN IT.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.795
THEY THINK IT CAME
FROM THE VICTIM'S SNEAKERS.

16:41.830 --> 16:43.263
PURPLE AND GOLD SPECKS.

16:43.300 --> 16:44.597
THAT'S JET JAGUARS.

16:44.630 --> 16:47.292
GUS OWNED THEM.
THEY'RE THE UGLIEST

16:47.340 --> 16:49.160
AND MOST UNCOMFORTABLE
SNEAKERS KNOWN TO MAN.

16:49.200 --> 16:50.736
I HAD A PAIR.
THEY WEREN'T THAT BAD.

16:50.770 --> 16:53.568
THEY WERE PROVEN
TO CAUSE POLIO.

16:53.610 --> 16:54.770
I HAVE ELONGATED METATARSALS
AND INVERTED PHALANGES, SPENCER,

16:54.810 --> 16:56.209
I HAVE TO WEAR
WHATEVER FITS.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.571
WELL THEN YOU KNOW THEY
WERE ONLY SOLD IN '98,

16:57.610 --> 17:00.374
AND THEN DISCONTINUED
IMMEDIATELY.

17:00.420 --> 17:01.671
THE VICTIM WAS WEARING
TEN-YEAR-OLD SNEAKERS?

17:01.720 --> 17:03.449
WHO HOLDS ONTO TENNIS SHOES
FOR THAT LONG?

17:03.490 --> 17:05.583
ESPECIALLY PAINFUL
PURPLE AND GOLD ONES?

17:05.620 --> 17:07.417
IF THIS MAN WAS WEARING THEM
AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH,

17:07.460 --> 17:09.087
THEN HE WAS DEFINITELY
KILLED IN '98,

17:09.120 --> 17:11.156
POSSIBLY BY
THE FASHION MAFIA.

17:11.190 --> 17:12.748
TEN YEARS AGO,
THAT MAKES NO SENSE.

17:12.790 --> 17:15.099
WHY WOULD SOMEONE HANG
ONTO A BODY FOR A DECADE

17:15.130 --> 17:16.199
AND THEN BURN IT
TO A CRISP?

17:16.230 --> 17:17.128
UNLESS...

17:17.170 --> 17:19.730
THE BODIES HAVE
BEEN THERE THE WHOLE TIME.

17:19.770 --> 17:21.590
JUST ROTTING FOR TEN YEARS?
THAT'S YOUR THEORY?

17:21.640 --> 17:22.789
ACTUALLY, COME TO THINK OF IT,

17:22.840 --> 17:24.569
BOTH BUILDINGS
WERE BUILT IN '98.

17:24.610 --> 17:25.759
AN EMPTY CONSTRUCTION SITE

17:25.810 --> 17:27.300
IS A GOOD PLACE
TO KILL SOMEONE,

17:27.340 --> 17:29.137
AND IT'D BE EASY TO SLIP
A BODY BEHIND THE DRYWALL.

17:29.180 --> 17:31.102
WHAT...

17:31.150 --> 17:33.573
YOU'RE SURE YOU'RE
NOT A GERMAPHOBE.

17:33.620 --> 17:34.575
ALL RIGHT, LET'S JUST
CONFIRM THE SNEAKER THING,

17:34.620 --> 17:35.746
AND IF SPENCER'S RIGHT,

17:35.780 --> 17:37.179
LET'S GET A LIST
OF ALL THE BUILDINGS

17:37.220 --> 17:38.482
THAT WERE BUILT TEN YEARS AGO.

17:38.520 --> 17:39.509
WHAT?

17:39.550 --> 17:41.552
YOU CAN JUST GET A LIST
OF THAT KIND OF STUFF?

17:41.590 --> 17:44.127
I'D LIKE A LIST OF ALL
AVAILABLE ZOLTAR MACHINES.

17:44.160 --> 17:46.628
FOR A LITTLE 14-YEAR-OLD
FRIEND OF MINE.

17:46.660 --> 17:48.321
THANKS, JULES.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.225
SO, MISS CONRAD.

17:50.270 --> 17:53.364
ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD KNOW
ABOUT THE SECOND FIRE?

17:53.400 --> 17:54.867
JUST THAT THE FIREFIGHTERS
CAUGHT A BREAK

17:54.900 --> 17:57.232
BECAUSE THERE WASN'T SUFFICIENT
VENTILATION ON THE TOP FLOOR.

17:57.270 --> 17:58.498
WITHOUT THE OXYGEN,

17:58.540 --> 18:00.474
THE MEN HAD NO TROUBLE
PUTTING OUT THE FIRE.

18:00.510 --> 18:01.477
YEAH, THAT WAS US.

18:01.510 --> 18:02.772
THANKS TO MANETTI, HERE.

18:02.810 --> 18:04.675
WE DOUSED THAT FIRE
IN 33 MINUTES.

18:04.710 --> 18:07.440
SO BOTH FIRES WENT OUT
RELATIVELY EASILY.

18:07.480 --> 18:08.515
I GUESS, YEAH.

18:08.550 --> 18:10.814
ARE YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

18:10.850 --> 18:13.512
I WILL BET EVERY PENNY
I HAVE THAT I'M NOT.

18:13.560 --> 18:17.348
THE ARSONIST MADE
THE FIRES EASY TO PUT OUT.

18:17.390 --> 18:19.620
HAVE YOU AT ALL CONSIDERED
THAT THIS IS AN INSIDE JOB?

18:19.660 --> 18:20.695
WELL, THIS BUILDING
WASN'T INSURED EITHER.

18:20.730 --> 18:21.799
THE OWNERS DON'T
GET ANYTHING.

18:21.830 --> 18:23.468
INSIDE YOUR DEPARTMENT.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.161
A FIREFIGHTER?

18:30.240 --> 18:32.800
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

18:32.840 --> 18:34.603
DO YOU SEE A BRUISE ON MY CHEST
FROM ALL THAT CPR?

18:34.640 --> 18:36.301
ALL I SEE IS CHOCOLATE
WITH HAIR ON IT.

18:36.340 --> 18:37.773
YOU KNOW THE RULES, SHAWN.

18:37.810 --> 18:39.675
NO SLIDING DOWN THE POLE
WHILE I'M NOT HERE.

18:39.710 --> 18:41.143
BUT YOU ARE HERE.
YOU'RE RIGHT HERE.

18:41.180 --> 18:42.875
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN,
ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M STUCK

18:42.920 --> 18:44.842
TAILING FIRE CHIEF DAN
ALL DAY.

18:44.890 --> 18:46.687
AND THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE
A DALMATIAN HERE, SHAWN.

18:46.720 --> 18:48.381
WOULD YOU STOP
WITH THE DALMATIANS ALREADY?

18:48.420 --> 18:49.387
I'M JUST SAYING

18:49.420 --> 18:51.285
IT'D BE NICE TO SEE ONE
IN HIS NATURAL HABITAT.

18:51.330 --> 18:54.322
THEY'RE NOT INDIGENOUS
TO FIREHOUSES, GUS.

18:54.360 --> 18:55.429
DID YOU FIND
ANYTHING OUT OR NOT?

18:55.460 --> 18:57.291
WELL, I HID IN A CORNER
WHILE HE GOT A PICTURE FRAMED

18:57.330 --> 18:59.662
OF HIM, JOHN DENVER,
AND THE MUPPETS.
MUPPETS?

18:59.700 --> 19:00.860
HEY, GONZO'S
WAS THE SHOT, BOY.

19:00.900 --> 19:02.629
WHAT?
SOUNDS PRODUCTIVE.

19:02.670 --> 19:03.637
THEN I JUST HAD
TO STAND AROUND

19:03.670 --> 19:04.807
WHILE HE SPENT AN HOUR
FIGURING OUT

19:04.840 --> 19:06.364
WHAT TYPE OF ROTOTILLER
TO BUY.

19:06.410 --> 19:07.707
WELL, IT'S NOT
AN EASY DECISION, GUS.

19:07.740 --> 19:09.879
AFTER ALL,
IT'S HARVEST SEASON, PA.

19:09.910 --> 19:11.639
JEB CAN'T WORK THE PLOW.
YOU KNOW HE AIN'T BEEN RIGHT

19:11.680 --> 19:13.341
SINCE HE COME DOWN
WITH THE CONSUMPTION.

19:13.380 --> 19:14.608
WILL YOU STOP, SHAWN?

19:14.650 --> 19:15.719
IT DID GET INTERESTING.

19:15.750 --> 19:17.342
HE'S OUR GUY,
AND I KNOW IT.

19:17.390 --> 19:18.914
HE WAS ON
HIS CELL PHONE CONSTANTLY.

19:18.950 --> 19:21.282
AND I THINK I HEARD HIM
ASK ABOUT THE ACCELERANT.

19:21.320 --> 19:23.527
AFTER THAT, HE CAME RUSHING
BACK HERE IN A PANIC.

19:23.560 --> 19:26.859
[door slams]

19:55.490 --> 19:58.482
[metal clattering]

20:10.370 --> 20:11.439
DUDE.

20:11.470 --> 20:12.801
IT'S SABOTAGE.

20:12.840 --> 20:14.273
HE'S MAKING IT HARDER
FOR THE MEN

20:14.310 --> 20:15.379
TO PUT OUT THE FIRES.

20:18.910 --> 20:20.878
(Gus)
WE GOTTA STOP HIM.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.255
HE'S HEADING
TO THE ALL-PURPOSE ROOM.

20:29.290 --> 20:30.951
THERE'S ONLY ONE EXIT
TO THAT ROOM.

20:30.990 --> 20:33.754
HERE'S THE PLAN:
WE CORNER, WE CONFRONT.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.927
HE CONFESSES?
WE GET SAMOSAS.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.291
BET.

20:39.730 --> 20:40.890
DUDE, IS THAT
REALLY NECESSARY?

20:40.940 --> 20:42.760
I DON'T PLAY
WITH KILLERS, SHAWN.

20:42.800 --> 20:46.634
[sighs]

20:51.480 --> 20:53.675
HELLO, CHILDREN.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.972
Uaugh'
in
YES!g]

20:56.020 --> 20:59.410
(Shawn)
FIELD TRIP
TO THE OLD FIRE STATION.

20:59.450 --> 21:00.678
WHAT'RE YOU TWO DOING?

21:00.720 --> 21:02.881
WE ARE HERE TO HELP
WITH THE LESSON.

21:02.920 --> 21:04.785
CLEARLY.

21:04.830 --> 21:07.822
SO, UH, KIDDIES,

21:07.860 --> 21:10.021
ALWAYS REMEMBER
TO PUT OUT YOUR CIGARETTES

21:10.060 --> 21:11.789
WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED
SMOKING THEM.

21:11.830 --> 21:13.058
UH--
EXCUSE ME?

21:13.100 --> 21:16.831
UH, I MEAN,
DON'T SMOKE.

21:16.870 --> 21:19.566
(Shawn)
UH, IN BED.

21:19.610 --> 21:22.636
OR IN RESTAURANTS.

21:22.680 --> 21:24.409
OR IN...
CAVES?

21:24.450 --> 21:27.613
NO SMOKING.
ABSOLUTELY NO SMOKING.

21:27.650 --> 21:28.617
AND DON'T LISTEN
TO ANYONE

21:28.650 --> 21:29.810
WHO SAYS THAT
A PIPE IS COOL,

21:29.850 --> 21:31.442
BECAUSE I'M TELLING YOU,

21:31.490 --> 21:33.082
IT IS NOT.

21:33.120 --> 21:34.087
GET OUT.

21:34.120 --> 21:36.088
GET OUT.
GET OUT!

21:36.120 --> 21:38.327
WELL, THAT WAS
A WASTE OF TIME.

21:38.360 --> 21:40.419
OR WAS IT?

21:40.460 --> 21:41.427
WHAT IS THAT?

21:41.460 --> 21:42.529
I ACCIDENTALLY
MIXED UP

21:42.560 --> 21:43.822
FIRE CHIEF DAN'S PHONE
WITH MINE.

21:43.870 --> 21:44.723
THEY'RE SIMILAR SHAPES,

21:44.770 --> 21:46.021
AND MY HAND WAS
IN HIS JACKET POCKET.

21:46.070 --> 21:46.866
YOU STOLE HIS PHONE?

21:46.900 --> 21:48.629
HE WAS THROWING US OUT--

21:48.670 --> 21:50.069
GUS, I PLEAD THE THIRD.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.135
THE THIRD AMENDMENT IS

21:51.170 --> 21:53.001
NO SOLDIER CAN LIVE IN
YOUR HOUSE AGAINST YOUR WILL.

21:53.040 --> 21:53.972
YOU MEAN THE FIFTH.

21:54.010 --> 21:55.432
I'VE HEARD IT
BOTH WAYS.

21:55.480 --> 21:56.504
WHAT OTHER WAYS
HAVE YOU HEARD IT?

21:56.540 --> 21:58.599
JUST LOOK AT THIS.

21:58.650 --> 21:59.878
FIVE CALLS IN A ROW

21:59.910 --> 22:00.740
TO HARDWARE STORES
ALL OVER THE CITY.

22:00.780 --> 22:02.839
WHERE ONE MIGHT GO
TO BUY METHYLBENZENE.

22:02.880 --> 22:04.939
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

22:04.990 --> 22:07.618
FIRE CHIEF DAN?

22:07.660 --> 22:08.888
HON ESTLY?

22:08.920 --> 22:10.785
THAT'S WHY YOU BROUGHT ME
DOWN TO THIS DEATH TRAP?

22:10.830 --> 22:11.956
DEATH TRAP?

22:11.990 --> 22:13.389
THIS OFFICE IS IN VIOLATION

22:13.430 --> 22:14.829
OF ALMOST EVERY
FIRE SAFETY CODE

22:14.860 --> 22:15.827
ON THE BOOKS.

22:15.860 --> 22:18.966
NOT TO CONTRADICT,

22:19.000 --> 22:20.865
BUT WE ARE 100% UP TO CODE.

22:20.900 --> 22:21.992
I DON'T WALK INTO A BUILDING
UNLESS IT'S SAFE.

22:22.040 --> 22:24.008
MUCH LESS WORK IN ONE.

22:24.040 --> 22:24.859
YOUR SMOKE DETECTOR

22:24.910 --> 22:26.730
IS A PAPER BOWL
WITH AN M&M STUCK TO IT.

22:26.770 --> 22:28.408
(Gus)
SHAWN,

22:28.440 --> 22:29.407
WHERE'S THE RYERSON
SMOKE DETECTOR

22:29.440 --> 22:30.407
I BOUGHT
FOR THE OFFICE?

22:30.450 --> 22:31.269
(Shawn)
OH, THAT THING?

22:31.310 --> 22:32.470
IT KEPT BEEPING
DURING SEANCE WEEK.

22:32.510 --> 22:33.579
WHERE IS IT NOW?

22:35.680 --> 22:37.545
CHARLESTON CHEW?
CHARLESTON CHEW.

22:37.590 --> 22:39.012
YOU ALSO HAVE

22:39.050 --> 22:40.711
AN OVERLOADED SOCKET,
AND A HOTPLATE ON THE GROUND.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.910
I LIKE SOUP.
I WON'T APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.

22:42.960 --> 22:45.053
IT'S NEXT TO A STACK
OF OLD NEWSPAPERS.

22:45.090 --> 22:47.957
I ALSO LIKE TO READ
WHILE I EAT.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.149
CAN YOU PLEASE JUST TELL ME
WHY YOU THINK IT'S DAN?

22:49.200 --> 22:51.896
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE I STOLE
HIS CELL PHONE OR ANYTHING.

22:51.930 --> 22:53.636
'CAUSE I MEAN I DON'T
DO THAT SORT OF THING.

22:53.670 --> 22:55.888
ALTHOUGH I'M SENSING SOMEONE
DID, I'LL SOLVE THAT LATER.

22:55.940 --> 22:57.931
NO, THIS, THIS WAS JUST
DEEPLY-ROOTED

22:57.970 --> 23:00.473
PSYCHIC VIBAGE.

23:00.510 --> 23:02.034
I KNOW IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.

23:02.080 --> 23:05.072
NO. ACTUALLY IT'S NOT.
IT KINDA MAKES SENSE.

23:05.110 --> 23:06.941
HE NEVER THOUGHT
IT WAS ARSON,

23:06.980 --> 23:09.676
AND HE HATED IT
WHEN I QUESTIONED HIS MEN.

23:09.720 --> 23:10.744
WHAT DID THE COPS SAY?

23:10.790 --> 23:12.087
WE HAVEN'T TOLD THEM.

23:12.120 --> 23:14.554
WE THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE
TO MAKE THE BUST.

23:14.590 --> 23:16.956
AFTER ALL,
THIS IS YOUR CASE.

23:16.990 --> 23:21.199
OH--
THAT--

23:21.230 --> 23:23.994
I MEAN, TO SAY THAT--
I MEAN, THAT--

23:24.030 --> 23:26.498
THAT YOU WOULD THINK OF ME.
THAT--

23:26.530 --> 23:28.088
YOU WOULD DO THAT.

23:28.140 --> 23:30.961
THIS SEEMS LIKE A GREAT
OPPORTUNITY FOR A HUG. C'MERE.

23:31.010 --> 23:32.204
EH--

23:32.240 --> 23:33.673
NO?
[cell phone vibrates]

23:33.710 --> 23:35.200
AH, ROTATOR CUFF.

23:35.240 --> 23:36.207
RIGHT.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.572
THERE'S BEEN ANOTHER FIRE.

23:38.610 --> 23:41.010
WITH ANOTHER BODY?

23:44.690 --> 23:46.146
FORENSICS IS ON THE WAY.

23:46.190 --> 23:49.455
ANOTHER BODY.
YOU WERE RIGHT.

23:49.490 --> 23:51.481
AS A COURTESY, I WANT TO LET YOU
KNOW MY OFFICE IS GOING TO BE

23:51.530 --> 23:54.158
BRINGING IN DAN TROMBLY
FOR QUESTIONING.

23:54.200 --> 23:55.724
THE FIRE CHIEF?
CORRECT.

23:55.760 --> 23:58.627
THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM.
WHY?

23:58.670 --> 24:00.558
BECAUSE...

24:00.600 --> 24:04.036
THAT SKELETON WASN'T
THE ONLY BODY WE FOUND.

24:04.070 --> 24:05.162
LIFT THAT, PLEASE.

24:05.210 --> 24:08.532
(Shawn)
AH.

24:15.650 --> 24:16.912
IT SAYS HERE THAT THE FIRE CHIEF
DIED OF ASPHYXIATION.

24:16.950 --> 24:20.147
SMOKE INHALATION.

24:20.190 --> 24:21.612
OH, I'M GETTING
SOMETHING.

24:21.660 --> 24:24.584
HOW MUCH MORE OF THIS
DO I HAVE TO ENDURE?

24:24.630 --> 24:27.121
DO YOU SEE THE BRUISE
ON MY CHEST FROM ALL THAT CPR?

24:27.160 --> 24:28.593
THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE THERE.

24:28.630 --> 24:29.699
THEY TRIED TO GIVE HIM CPR
BEFORE HE DIED.

24:29.730 --> 24:31.266
MAYBE SOMEONE
WHO KNEW HIM.

24:31.300 --> 24:32.619
OF COURSE
THEY KNEW HIM.

24:32.670 --> 24:33.898
IT'S LIKE PRACTICALLY
KISSING HIM.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.589
WHAT THE HELL WAS THE FIRE CHIEF
DOING THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE?

24:35.640 --> 24:36.868
I MEAN, I DON'T THINK
HE STARTED THE FIRE.

24:36.900 --> 24:37.832
HE WASN'T WEARING
ANY PROTECTIVE GEAR,

24:37.870 --> 24:39.735
THERE WEREN'T ANY TRACES
OF ACCELERANTS ON HIM.

24:39.770 --> 24:40.873
WE GOT A BREAK.

24:40.910 --> 24:42.775
THE LATEST SKELETON
IS STILL TOO BURNED

24:42.810 --> 24:44.744
TO GET AN I.D.,
BUT OUR KILLER DIDN'T KNOW

24:44.780 --> 24:45.599
THAT OUR VICTIM

24:45.650 --> 24:46.901
HAD AN ICD IN HIS BODY.

24:46.950 --> 24:48.212
EW. THEY MAKE THOSE
FOR MEN?

24:48.250 --> 24:49.410
IT'S LIKE A PACEMAKER.

24:49.450 --> 24:51.611
TRACKED THE SERIAL NUMBER
BACK TO CENTRAL COAST COMPONENTS

24:51.650 --> 24:53.242
WHO SOLD IT
TO SAINT MARY'S

24:53.290 --> 24:55.110
WHO IMPLANTED IT INTO OUR VICTIM
12 YEARS AGO.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.549
OKAY, WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT OUR VICTIM?

24:57.590 --> 24:59.626
WAIT, OUR SKELETON
WAS A CRIMINAL?

24:59.660 --> 25:01.719
THAT'S RIGHT.
HIS NAME IS STEVEN J. RENKEL.

25:01.760 --> 25:03.125
AS IN THE KID
FROM FAMILY MATTERS.

25:03.160 --> 25:04.297
NO.

25:04.330 --> 25:05.661
AS IN THE RENKEL
FIRES OF '98.
YES.

25:05.700 --> 25:06.826
GUYS, BRING IT IN.

25:06.870 --> 25:08.838
SO OUR VICTIM
IS A FIRESTARTER HIMSELF?

25:08.870 --> 25:10.531
YEAH, THEY WERE
A BUNCH OF VANDALS

25:10.570 --> 25:13.869
WHO LIKED GOING AROUND
AND STARTING FIRES.

25:13.910 --> 25:19.598
THESE ARE RENKEL'S
ONLY KNOWN ACCOMPLICES.

25:20.680 --> 25:25.117
WHOA.
OH, I'M GETTING SOMETHING.

25:25.150 --> 25:26.708
THE SECOND VICTIM IS
IN ONE OF THOSE PICTURES.

25:26.750 --> 25:28.115
WHAT?
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

25:28.160 --> 25:29.286
HE'S TELLING ME
HE WAS MURDERED,

25:29.320 --> 25:30.309
HE'S SAYING IT POORLY 'CAUSE
HE SPEAKS WITH A WHISTH-LE.

25:30.360 --> 25:32.885
A WHITHLE, LIKE THITH,
HE THPEAKTH LIKE THITH.

25:32.930 --> 25:34.693
WHICH WOULD BE ENDEARING
ON AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD,

25:34.730 --> 25:36.322
MAYBE TERRY THOMAS,
OR THE ORIGINAL SUPERMODEL

25:36.360 --> 25:37.998
LAUREN HUTTON.

25:38.030 --> 25:39.327
BUT THIS, THIS JUST SCREAMS
FOR ADULT BRACES.

25:39.370 --> 25:42.066
ANY FORM OF SIMPLE
ORTHODONTIA, REALLY,

25:42.100 --> 25:43.260
IT'S NOT THAT EXPENSIVE.

25:43.300 --> 25:45.063
YOU'RE SAYING IT'S THE GUY
WHO HAS THE GAP IN HIS TEETH?

25:45.110 --> 25:46.634
DON'T SAY "GAP."
HE PREFERS "TOOTH ALLEY,"

25:46.670 --> 25:48.638
BUT YETH, IT ITH.

25:48.680 --> 25:49.806
I REMEMBER THESE GUYS.

25:49.840 --> 25:50.602
THEY ALL DISAPPEARED
AROUND THE SAME TIME.

25:50.650 --> 25:51.799
WE FIGURED
THEY'D JUST SKIPPED TOWN.

25:51.850 --> 25:53.272
THAT'S IT!

25:53.310 --> 25:54.811
THE THIRD VICTIM
IS UP THERE AS WELL.

25:54.850 --> 25:56.249
HE'S NOT SPEAKING

25:56.280 --> 25:57.679
BECAUSE HE'S AFRAID
YOU'LL CRITICIZE HIS APPEARANCE,

25:57.720 --> 25:58.709
JUST LIKE YOU DID
WITH TOOTH GAP BOY.

25:58.750 --> 25:59.910
LOOK, NOW YOU GOT ME DOING IT.

25:59.950 --> 26:01.759
SOMEONE MUST'VE
HUNTED THEM DOWN

26:01.790 --> 26:02.711
AND KILLED THEM
TEN YEARS AGO.

26:02.760 --> 26:04.318
AND NOW THEY'RE BURNING OFF
THE EVIDENCE.

26:04.360 --> 26:06.726
IT'S A LONG TIME TO WAIT
TO CLEAN UP A MESS.

26:06.760 --> 26:08.853
YOU SHOULD SEE HOW LONG IT TAKES
GUS TO CLEAN HIS CEREAL BOWL.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.595
(Juliet)
ONLY ONE GUY IN THE CREW

26:10.630 --> 26:12.097
HAS BEEN A SUSPECT
IN OTHER ARSONS

26:12.130 --> 26:13.165
SINCE THE RENKEL FIRE.

26:13.200 --> 26:15.737
AND THAT'S BODIE LAMBERT.

26:15.770 --> 26:17.362
ALL RIGHT,
SO WHY IS BODIE

26:17.400 --> 26:18.901
THE ONLY ONE WE'RE STILL
HEARING FROM?

26:18.940 --> 26:20.737
MAYBE HE TURNED ON
HIS PARTNERS.

26:20.780 --> 26:21.735
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

26:21.780 --> 26:23.702
THIS COULD BE OUR KILLER.

26:23.750 --> 26:24.705
FURDERER.

26:24.750 --> 26:25.705
WHAT?

26:25.750 --> 26:27.718
FIRE MURDERER.

26:27.750 --> 26:28.717
FURDERER.

26:28.750 --> 26:31.048
PUT A BOLO
ON HIM, ASAP.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.717
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA...

26:32.750 --> 26:34.615
YOU'RE GONNA ISSUE
THESE GUYS BOLO TIES?

26:34.660 --> 26:36.810
IT STANDS
FOR "BE ON THE LOOKOUT."

26:40.830 --> 26:41.990
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:42.030 --> 26:43.759
ARMY WILL KILL YOU IF HE SEES
YOU MESSING WITH THIS STUFF.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.722
WELL, WHY ARE WE HERE?

26:45.770 --> 26:47.169
THE COPS ARE FOLLOWING
THE BODIES.

26:47.200 --> 26:48.690
I THOUGHT WE'D TAKE
A DIFFERENT AVENUE.

26:48.740 --> 26:49.798
THE BUILDINGS.

26:49.840 --> 26:51.865
WHAT DO WE KNOW?

26:51.910 --> 26:53.002
THEY'RE ALL COMMERCIAL
AND INDUSTRIAL.

26:53.040 --> 26:53.836
AND...

26:53.880 --> 26:56.098
THEY WERE ALL BUILT
IN THE SAME YEAR.

26:56.140 --> 26:57.107
AFTER THE RENKEL FIRE.

26:57.140 --> 26:58.778
CORRECT.

26:58.810 --> 27:02.678
LOTTA OPEN SPACES. NO FURNITURE
CLUTTERING UP THE JOINT.

27:02.720 --> 27:07.316
ALSO. THEY SEEMED
TO BE ABANDONED.

27:07.350 --> 27:09.352
YET NONE OF THEM
ARE FOR SALE.

27:09.390 --> 27:11.255
WHY WOULD THREE
DIFFERENT OWNERS

27:11.290 --> 27:13.121
LEAVE VALUABLE REAL ESTATE
LIKE THAT SITTING AROUND EMPTY?

27:13.160 --> 27:14.821
[door opens]

27:14.860 --> 27:17.420
WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU GUYS?

27:17.460 --> 27:19.769
WE NEED TO SEE YOUR FILES
ON THE THREE BURNED BUILDINGS.

27:19.800 --> 27:21.836
SURE, JUST FILL OUT
REQUISITION FORM IG88,

27:21.870 --> 27:24.009

(Morgan)
ARMY, THAT WILL TAKE FOREVER.
WE REALLY NEED TO 5--

27:25.470 --> 27:28.405
PAPERWORK IS PAPERWORK.
IT'S THE BASIS FOR CIVILIZATION.

27:28.440 --> 27:29.702
JUST FILL OUT THE FORMS,

27:29.740 --> 27:30.707

27:30.750 --> 27:31.876
[fire alarm sounds]

27:31.910 --> 27:33.741
FIRE ALARM.

27:33.780 --> 27:34.940
WE'D BETTER EVACUATE.

27:34.980 --> 27:38.086
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY OUTTA HERE.
I GOTTA GO DEAL WITH THIS.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.924
GOOD THING WE HAD
A PLAN B READY.

27:52.970 --> 27:54.369
YOU SMELL LIKE
A PEACH MEADOW.

27:54.400 --> 27:57.437
THAT'S THE INCENSE I USED
TO SET OFF THE SMOKE DETECTOR.

27:57.470 --> 27:58.437
YOU DIDN'T JUST PULL
THE FIRE ALARM?

27:58.470 --> 27:59.437
IT'S RIGHT THERE
ON THE WALL.

27:59.470 --> 28:02.928
UH, THAT'S A CRIME, SHAWN.
I REMAIN NOT CULPABLE.

28:02.980 --> 28:05.801
I DIDN'T SET OFF THE DETECTOR.
THE SMOKE DID.

28:05.850 --> 28:07.715
WHO BURNED
THE INCENSE?
I PLEAD THE FIFTH.

28:07.750 --> 28:08.717
MM-HMM.

28:08.750 --> 28:10.342
ELEMENT, DIMENSION, BEATLE?

28:10.380 --> 28:12.314
YOU CAN'T PLEAD
"BILLY PRESTON."

28:12.350 --> 28:13.317
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT'RE WE DOING?

28:13.350 --> 28:16.057
BRING UP
THE BURNT BUILDINGS.

28:16.090 --> 28:18.229
OKAY.

28:18.260 --> 28:19.921
(Gus)
HERE WE ARE.

28:19.960 --> 28:22.929
DUDE.

28:22.960 --> 28:23.824
ALL THESE BUILDINGS
HAVE "SR" NEXT TO 'EM.

28:23.870 --> 28:26.293
THAT STANDS
FOR "SEISMIC RETROFIT."

28:26.330 --> 28:29.367
IT APPLIES TO ANY BUILDING
BUILT IN '98.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.960
LOOKS LIKE ALL
THE SAFETY CODES

28:32.010 --> 28:33.034
WERE JUST CHANGED LAST WEEK.

28:33.070 --> 28:34.970
RIGHT BEFORE THE FIRST FIRE.

28:35.010 --> 28:36.409
THAT'S WHY
THEY'RE ALL EMPTY.

28:36.440 --> 28:38.271
THEY'RE NO LONGER
CONSIDERED EARTHQUAKE SAFE.

28:38.310 --> 28:40.813
THEY'RE GONNA OPEN UP THE WALLS
TO BRING THEM UP TO CODE.

28:40.850 --> 28:42.044
DUDE, THAT'S IT.

28:42.080 --> 28:44.412
THAT'S WHAT STARTED
THIS WHOLE THING.

28:44.450 --> 28:45.417
THE KILLER REALIZED
THAT THE BODIES

28:45.450 --> 28:46.883
HE STASHED IN THOSE BUILDINGS
TEN YEARS AGO

28:46.920 --> 28:47.750
ARE GONNA BE DISCOVERED,

28:47.790 --> 28:49.883
AND NOW HE'S TORCHING
THE EVIDENCE.

28:49.920 --> 28:51.080
THERE'S, LIKE,
20 BUILDINGS

28:51.130 --> 28:52.381
SCHEDULED TO BE
RETROFITTED.

28:52.430 --> 28:53.419
LEMME PRINT OUT
THE LIST.

28:53.460 --> 28:54.791
WELL, STEP IT UP.

28:54.830 --> 28:55.728
WE STILL HAVE
A FEW MINUTES

28:55.760 --> 28:56.897
BEFORE THEY LET ANYBODY BACK
IN THE BUILDING.

28:56.930 --> 29:00.969
DUDE, TRUST ME.
YOU WANNA HURRY.

29:04.040 --> 29:05.962
YOU COULDA PULLED ME
OUTTA THERE.

29:06.010 --> 29:07.363
DUDE, I GAVE YOU
TWO FULL WARNINGS.

29:07.410 --> 29:08.832
MY UNDERWEAR'S SOAKED.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.131
JUST LIKE
OLD TIMES.
KISS MY--

29:10.180 --> 29:10.976
GUYS.

29:11.010 --> 29:12.204
ONE OF THOSE BUILDINGS
IS GONNA BE

29:12.250 --> 29:13.308
TARGETED NEXT
BY THE ARSONIST.

29:13.350 --> 29:14.442

29:14.480 --> 29:17.938
I'M AL B. SURE WATCHING
DIANE SCHUUR APPLY SURE ROLL-ON.

29:17.990 --> 29:19.981

29:20.020 --> 29:20.952
THAT'S PRETTY SURE.

29:20.990 --> 29:22.014
IT'S ALL-DAY SURE.

29:22.060 --> 29:24.528
YOU ARE A STRANGE PERSON,

29:24.560 --> 29:26.778
BUT EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE.

29:26.830 --> 29:28.525
SEE? A LITTLE TEAMWORK
ISN'T THE WORST THING.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.528
PSYCHICALLY, I COULD
SENSE THAT THERE WAS

29:30.560 --> 29:32.960
INFORMATION IN THAT OFFICE
THAT WE NEEDED, SO, UH,

29:33.000 --> 29:34.797
WE'LL GO CHECK WITH THE COPS
WHILE YOU SCOPE THOSE OUT.

29:34.840 --> 29:37.900
[imitates explosion]

29:37.940 --> 29:40.534

29:40.570 --> 29:43.437
H EY!
THAT'S FAIR.

29:45.950 --> 29:46.974
(Vick)
HEY.

29:47.010 --> 29:48.170
WE GOT A HIT
ON THAT BOLO.

29:48.220 --> 29:50.017
SHERIFF IN BARSTOW
FOUND BODIE LAMBERT

29:50.050 --> 29:52.439
HOLED UP IN A MOTEL 6
UNDER ONE OF HIS ALIASES.

29:52.490 --> 29:54.014
EXCELLENT.

29:54.060 --> 29:54.879
DOBSON!

29:54.920 --> 29:56.217
GET A HOLD OF BARSTOW PD,

29:56.260 --> 29:57.818
TELL 'EM NOT TO MAKE A MOVE
WITHOUT US.

29:57.860 --> 30:00.488
HE IS MINE.

30:05.070 --> 30:09.860
POLICE!

30:09.900 --> 30:10.901
CLEAR.

30:10.940 --> 30:11.907
O'HARA, YOU GOT ANYTHING?

30:11.940 --> 30:13.009
NOTHING HERE.

30:13.040 --> 30:13.938
[into walkie-talkie]
ALL CLEAR.

30:13.980 --> 30:16.574
DO THESE THINGS COME
IN DIFFERENT SIZES?

30:16.610 --> 30:17.577
BECAUSE MY MOVEMENT
IS VERY CONSTRICT ED.

30:17.610 --> 30:19.498
I FEEL LIKE IT'S CREATING
ALL THE WRONG LINES.

30:19.550 --> 30:20.949
MAYBE IF THEY
WERE V-NECKS,

30:20.980 --> 30:22.049
OR LAPELS.

30:22.080 --> 30:23.047
OR EPAULETS.

30:23.080 --> 30:24.286
WHAT'RE THEY DOING HERE?

30:24.320 --> 30:25.548
I MAY HAVE GIVEN THEM
A HEADS-UP.

30:25.590 --> 30:27.444
IT WASN'T EXACTLY
AN INVITATION.

30:27.490 --> 30:28.855
WELL, HE MUST'VE BOLTED
OUT THE WINDOW.

30:28.890 --> 30:29.959
HE'S NOT GONNA
GET FAR.

30:29.990 --> 30:30.979
AERIAL TWO,

30:31.030 --> 30:31.849
YOU GOT
A TWENTY ON THE PERP?

30:31.890 --> 30:33.027
YOU CALLED IN AIR SUPPORT
FOR THIS?

30:33.060 --> 30:34.095
OF COURSE I DID.

30:34.130 --> 30:36.496
'SCUSE ME.

30:37.530 --> 30:39.327
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

30:39.370 --> 30:45.036

30:45.070 --> 30:48.608
OW!

30:48.640 --> 30:49.629

30:49.680 --> 30:52.501
PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

31:02.120 --> 31:03.656
HE'S NOT TALKING.

31:03.690 --> 31:06.079
I SENSE THAT
HE'S SUPERSTITIOUS.

31:06.130 --> 31:06.858
HE MIGHT TALK
TO SOMEONE

31:06.890 --> 31:09.256
FROM A HIGHER
ETHEREAL PLANE.

31:09.300 --> 31:11.291
MAY I HAVE A SHOT?

31:11.330 --> 31:12.297
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

31:12.330 --> 31:13.422
GIMME A SECOND.

31:13.470 --> 31:17.497
I HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE AND GET
SOMETHING OFF THE GROUND.

31:19.040 --> 31:22.305
HEY.

31:22.340 --> 31:28.210
SHAWN SPENCER.
PSYCHIC INTERROGATOR.

31:28.250 --> 31:30.070
MAYBE YOU REMEMBER ME
FROM WHEN I APPREHENDED YOU?

31:30.120 --> 31:32.543
REMEMBER BACK THEN?

31:32.590 --> 31:35.980
NO?
THAT'S OKAY.

31:36.020 --> 31:37.658
I GOT EVERYTHING I NEED.
HAVE FUN IN PRISON.

31:37.690 --> 31:41.296
WORD TO THE WISE:
DON'T DROP THE BAR OF SOAP.

31:41.330 --> 31:43.457
OH, PLEASE.
DON'T TRY THAT ROUTINE ON ME.

31:43.500 --> 31:46.025
NO, LITERALLY, MAN.
DON'T DROP THE SOAP.

31:46.070 --> 31:47.935
THERE'S SO MUCH BACTERIA
ON THOSE FLOORS.

31:47.970 --> 31:50.689
I'M PRETTY SURE THEY ONLY
ISSUE ONE BAR A MONTH, SO...

31:50.740 --> 31:52.139
WHY ARE YOU EATING THAT?

31:52.170 --> 31:53.706
RAW LEAVES IS WHAT
THE EARTH MOTHER

31:53.740 --> 31:55.503
ALLOWS ME TO EAT.

31:55.540 --> 31:57.178
IT BANISHES
ALL NEGATIVE ENTITIES.

31:57.210 --> 31:58.245
WHAT, ARE YOU A FAIRY?

31:58.280 --> 31:59.679
HARDLY. I'VE SEEN

32:01.980 --> 32:03.447
BUT I AM A MALE WICCAN.

YOU'RE NOT WICCAN.

32:04.750 --> 32:06.149
I'M LEVEL EIGHT, JACK.

32:06.190 --> 32:07.509
I'D BE LEVEL NINE

EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID, MAN.

32:27.470 --> 32:29.404
OHHH.

32:29.440 --> 32:34.173
IT IS SO DOPE TO CONNECT
WITH OTHER WEIRDOS.

32:34.220 --> 32:35.448
BUT RIGHT HERE, MAN,
YOU AND ME?

32:35.480 --> 32:37.038
WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER.

32:37.080 --> 32:39.241

32:46.390 --> 32:47.527
AND HAUL YOU OUT,

32:47.560 --> 32:49.221
SO I'M GONNA LEVEL
WITH YOU.

32:49.260 --> 32:53.526
THE EARTH FORCE MOTHER
IS PRETTY P.O.'ED AT YOU, MAN.

32:53.570 --> 32:55.561
ME?

32:55.600 --> 32:57.090
YOU'RE CRAZY.
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

32:57.140 --> 32:59.062
SHE SENT ME HERE
TO STOP YOU.

32:59.110 --> 33:00.099
HOW DO YOU THINK
I FOUND YOU

33:00.140 --> 33:01.209
IN THAT CEILING, BRO?

33:01.240 --> 33:02.776
LUCK? NO.

33:02.810 --> 33:04.107
I GOT A MESSAGE.

33:04.150 --> 33:05.777
WHY IS THE EARTH SPIRIT
AFTER ME?

33:05.810 --> 33:09.644
SHE KNOWS YOU LIT
THOSE FIRES, BRO.

33:09.680 --> 33:12.080
WE FOUND THE CREWMATES
YOU MURDERED IN THE BUILDINGS.

33:12.120 --> 33:13.485
I DIDN'T KILL
NOBODY, BROTHER.

33:13.520 --> 33:15.158
IT MUST'VE BEEN THAT GUY.

33:15.190 --> 33:18.421
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WHAT GUY?

33:18.460 --> 33:22.726
TEN YEARS AGO, SOMEBODY STARTED
HUNTING US DOWN.

33:22.760 --> 33:24.261
SOMEONE GRABBED ME
OUTTA MY CAR.

33:24.300 --> 33:26.723
TOOK ME
TO SOME CONSTRUCTION SITE.

33:26.770 --> 33:27.828
MADE ME GET ON MY KNEES.

33:27.870 --> 33:31.067
TOLD ME I HAD TO PAY
FOR KILLING THOSE TWO FIREMEN.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.032
THEN HE PULLS THE TRIGGER.
NOTHING HAPPENS.

33:33.070 --> 33:35.675
ARGH!

33:35.710 --> 33:36.699
(Bodie)
I GET THE HELL OUTTA THERE.

33:36.740 --> 33:39.641
I HAVEN'T BEEN TO SANTA BARBARA
SINCE THAT NIGHT.

33:39.680 --> 33:42.319
I FOUND WICCA.

33:42.350 --> 33:43.647
AND REFORMED.

33:43.680 --> 33:47.218
WHERE'D THIS MYSTERY MAN
TAKE YOU, BRO?

33:47.250 --> 33:49.286
LIKE, AN ADDRESS
OR SOMETHING?

33:49.320 --> 33:51.379
HAD A BAG OVER MY HEAD
MOST OF THE TIME.

33:51.430 --> 33:53.648
BUT THAT NIGHT IS BURNED
IN MY MIND.

33:53.690 --> 33:56.056
I WAS ABOUT TO DIE,

33:56.100 --> 33:58.227
AND ALL I REMEMBER
HEARING IS BIRDS.

33:58.270 --> 33:59.760
LOTS OF THEM.

33:59.800 --> 34:02.735
SOUNDED LIKE HUNDREDS.

34:02.770 --> 34:05.136
BIRDS.

34:05.170 --> 34:07.309
YEAH. CHIRPING.

34:07.340 --> 34:11.674
WICCA OUT, BROTHA.

34:18.890 --> 34:20.243
(Spencer)
SHAWN, I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE

34:20.290 --> 34:22.155
THE POLICE THOUGHT
YOUR BIRD-CHIRPING CLUE

34:22.190 --> 34:23.487
WAS TOO VAGUE.

34:23.520 --> 34:24.487
(Shawn)
WELL, THEY'RE STILL
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

34:24.530 --> 34:26.157
WHAT BUILDING BODIE
WAS TAKEN TO.

34:26.190 --> 34:27.623
HEY.
HEY.

34:27.660 --> 34:29.651
WELL, AT LEAST BODIE TOLD US
THE KILLER'S MOTIVES.

34:29.700 --> 34:30.621
SOMEONE IS AVENGING
THE DEATHS

34:30.660 --> 34:32.321
OF THE FIREMEN KILLED
DURING THE RENKEL FIRES.

34:32.370 --> 34:34.338
MAYBE IT IS A FIREFIGHTER.

34:34.370 --> 34:36.565
I WARNED YOU, SHAWN.
FIREFIGHTERS ARE TROUBLE.

34:36.600 --> 34:38.636
I DID EVERYTHING IN MY POWER
TO KEEP YOU OFF THE POLE.

34:38.670 --> 34:42.333
AND YOU SUCCEEDED, DAD,
IN EVERY CONCEIVABLE WAY.

34:42.380 --> 34:44.200
BUT, SINCE OUR BAD GUY
WAS TARGETING CRIMINALS,

34:44.250 --> 34:46.844
ROGUE COP IS NOW ADDED
TO THE LIST.

34:46.880 --> 34:49.212
LOOK, WE HAVE ALL
THE POTENTIAL ARSON TARGETS.

34:49.250 --> 34:51.309
SINCE OUR KILLER SCOUTED
ONE OUT FOR BODIE,

34:51.350 --> 34:53.341
HE MAY HAVE STILL
USED THEM FOR OTHER VICTIMS.

34:53.390 --> 34:55.255
AND ALL YOU GOT GOING ON
IS YOUR BIRD CHIRPING.

34:55.290 --> 34:56.689
WAIT A MINUTE.

34:56.720 --> 34:58.187
WHAT ABOUT
MRS. MUGGLESWORTH?

34:58.230 --> 34:59.788
MY COCKATOO
WHEN I WAS EIGHT?

34:59.830 --> 35:01.889
YEAH.
WOW. I HAVEN'T THOUGHT
ABOUT HER IN YEARS.

35:01.930 --> 35:03.522
REMEMBER WHEN SHE DIED,
YOUR PARENTS FED YOU SOME STORY

35:03.560 --> 35:04.697
ABOUT TAKING
HER SOMEWHERE?

35:04.730 --> 35:05.697
THE BIRD SANCTUARY.

35:05.730 --> 35:06.822
BUT SHE'S NOT DEAD.

35:06.870 --> 35:08.861
SHE'S STILL THERE,
LIVING AMONGST

35:08.900 --> 35:09.992
OTHER RELINQUISHED AVIANS.

35:10.040 --> 35:12.565
GUS, HAVE YOU SEEN HER SINCE
YOUR PARENTS TOOK HER THERE?

35:12.610 --> 35:13.634
OF COURSE NOT.

35:13.670 --> 35:14.898
SHE HAD A RARE
BIRD DISEASE

35:14.940 --> 35:15.907
WHERE SHE WOULD
LOSE HER FEATHERS

35:15.940 --> 35:16.929
IF ANYONE EVER
LOOKED AT HER.

35:16.980 --> 35:20.143
SO SHE HAS TO BE KEPT
IN A SPECIAL MIRRORED CAGE.

35:20.180 --> 35:21.147
WHAT?

35:21.180 --> 35:23.273
GUS, YOUR PARENTS LIED TO YOU.

35:23.320 --> 35:25.709
WE DO IT SOMETIMES
TO PROTECT OUR KIDS.

35:25.750 --> 35:26.717
YOUR BIRD BIT THE BIG ONE.

35:26.750 --> 35:28.354
SORRY, PAL.

35:28.390 --> 35:30.187
YEAH, NOT ALL PETS CAN GO LIVE
ON A SPECIAL WHEAT FARM

35:30.220 --> 35:31.653
LIKE MY RABBITS.

35:31.690 --> 35:32.725
THAT'S RIGHT, SON.

35:32.760 --> 35:34.899
WHERE IS
THIS BIRD SANCTUARY?

35:34.930 --> 35:37.922
THIRD STREET AND D.

35:37.960 --> 35:39.359
THIRD AND D.
YEAH.

35:39.400 --> 35:40.162
REALLY?

35:40.200 --> 35:42.566
DUDE, HUNDREDS
OF BIRDS CHIRPING.

35:42.600 --> 35:44.238
THAT NEVER OCCURRED
TO YOU TILL NOW?

35:44.270 --> 35:46.409
LEAVING MRS. MUGGLESWORTH
WAS A PAINFUL MEMORY, SHAWN.

35:46.440 --> 35:48.476
I BLOCKED IT OUT
UNTIL 12 SECONDS AGO.

35:48.510 --> 35:50.501
GUYS, GUYS, GUYS.
THE DAEDALUS BUILDING.

35:50.540 --> 35:51.404
IT'S RIGHT THERE.
RIGHT IN THAT AREA.

35:51.450 --> 35:52.803
WELL WHEN IS IT SCHEDDED
TO BE RETROFITTED?

35:52.850 --> 35:54.044
TOMORROW.

35:54.080 --> 35:57.868
WELL THAT MEANS YOUR PYROMANIAC
IS GONNA GET TO WORK TODAY.

35:57.920 --> 35:59.581
SHAWN, WE TOLD MORGAN
TO CHECK ALL THESE BUILDINGS.

35:59.620 --> 36:01.258
I GOTTA CALL HER.

36:01.290 --> 36:02.257
TELL HER NOT TO GO
IN WITHOUT BACKUP.

36:02.290 --> 36:05.282
[phone vibrates]

36:23.510 --> 36:25.307
DAMMIT, I STILL CAN'T
GET A HOLD OF MORGAN.

36:25.350 --> 36:26.203
I GOT A BAD FEELING
ABOUT THIS.

36:26.250 --> 36:27.842
YOU CALL LASSITER
AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT?

36:27.880 --> 36:30.314
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY.

36:37.760 --> 36:40.729
(both)
MORGAN!

36:40.760 --> 36:45.629
[clattering]

36:45.670 --> 36:47.365
ARMY JOHNSON?

36:47.400 --> 36:48.992
(Army)
STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.861
DON'T MAKE A MOVE.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.866
DUDE. START TALKING.

36:53.910 --> 36:55.434
STALL HIM
TILL EVERYBODY GETS HERE.

36:55.480 --> 36:57.277
DON'T LET HIM TOSS
THAT FLAME.

36:57.310 --> 37:00.575
I KNOW YOU KILLED
THOSE CRIMINALS.

37:00.610 --> 37:02.339
BUT I KNOW WHY.

37:02.380 --> 37:05.713
HONEY, THE LAST TIME
THIS CITY HAD AN ARSONIST WAS

37:05.750 --> 37:07.980
SO LONG AGO, I WAS
STILL ON THE BIG RED TRUCK.

37:08.020 --> 37:09.908
BECAUSE BACK IN THE DAY,

37:09.960 --> 37:11.427
YOU WERE A FIREMAN.

37:11.460 --> 37:14.258
AND THOSE VANDALS SET FIRES

37:14.300 --> 37:16.359
THAT TOOK THE LIVES
OF TWO OF YOUR COLLEAGUES.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.493
DIED FIGHTING THE RENKEL FIRES
OF '98.

37:18.530 --> 37:20.566
SET BY A BUNCH OF VANDALS.

37:20.600 --> 37:23.535
I SERVED SIDE-BY-SIDE
WITH THOSE FIREMEN FOR YEARS.

37:23.570 --> 37:24.798
THEY HAD FAMILIES.

37:24.840 --> 37:27.900
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THEY DID.

37:27.940 --> 37:29.976
SO YOU LEFT THE DEPARTMENT.

37:30.010 --> 37:32.547
YOU TOOK A JOB

37:32.580 --> 37:33.877
INSPECTING BUILDINGS
FOR CODE VIOLATIONS.

37:33.910 --> 37:36.708
AND YOU DISCOVERED...

37:36.750 --> 37:38.889
THOSE ARE PRETTY GOOD PLACES
TO HIDE A BODY.

37:38.920 --> 37:40.342
[gunshot]

37:42.520 --> 37:43.680
YOU COVERED THEM
WITH LYE,

37:43.720 --> 37:45.551
AND THEN PLUGGED THEM
INTO WALLS.

37:54.070 --> 37:57.528
BUT YOUR OLD BUDDY
THE FIRE CHIEF FIGURED YOU OUT.

37:57.570 --> 37:58.707
MADE A FEW CALLS.

37:58.740 --> 38:00.332
FIVE CALLS IN A ROW
TO HARDWARE STORES

38:00.370 --> 38:01.473
ALL OVER THE CITY.

38:01.510 --> 38:04.479
AFFIRMED THAT IT WAS YOU
THAT BOUGHT THE ACCELERANT...

38:05.650 --> 38:07.606
THEN FINALLY,
HE CAUGHT YOU IN THE ACT.

38:07.650 --> 38:09.811
ARMY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

38:09.850 --> 38:11.647
DON'T DO IT! DON'T DO IT!

38:11.690 --> 38:14.352
(Shawn)
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE,
WASN'T IT?

38:14.390 --> 38:17.484
ALWAYS THE FIREMAN,
HE TRIED TO PUT IT OUT.

38:20.630 --> 38:23.451
YOU EVEN TRIED
TO SAVE HIS LIFE.

38:23.500 --> 38:25.024
COME ON, DANNY.

38:25.070 --> 38:27.721
IT WASN'T MY FAULT.

38:27.770 --> 38:29.089
DANNY WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE THERE.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.358
WHAT ABOUT US?

38:31.410 --> 38:32.468
HUH?

38:32.510 --> 38:33.807
WHAT ABOUT
YOUR ARSON INSPECTOR?

38:33.840 --> 38:36.536
WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

38:36.580 --> 38:38.036
DO WE DESERVE
TO DIE?

38:42.920 --> 38:45.548
I DON'T...

38:46.920 --> 38:50.481
I DON'T...

38:50.520 --> 38:51.487
NO.

38:51.530 --> 38:52.588
NO.

38:52.630 --> 38:54.552
BUT--

38:54.600 --> 38:56.556
BUT I CAN'T LIVE
WITH THIS ANYMORE.

38:56.600 --> 38:58.363
NO.

38:58.400 --> 38:59.867

39:18.820 --> 39:20.549

WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

40:31.930 --> 40:33.625

40:37.130 --> 40:40.520

40:44.670 --> 40:45.659

40:48.270 --> 40:57.577
REALLY?

40:57.620 --> 40:59.087
WELL, LOOK AT THAT.

40:59.120 --> 41:01.042
GOT YOU DOING THE GRUNT WORK,
HUH?

41:01.090 --> 41:03.183
WELL, ALL THE NEW VOLUNTEERS
HAVE TO DO IT.

41:03.220 --> 41:04.016
HOW'S IT GOING SO FAR?

41:04.060 --> 41:05.948
I'M PRETTY MUCH A HERO
TO THE NEWBIES.

41:05.990 --> 41:07.480
I MEAN, I'VE ALREADY BEEN
IN TWO FIRES,

41:07.530 --> 41:09.623
CARRIED A MAN OUT,
STOPPED AN ARSONIST.

41:09.660 --> 41:11.218
YES, YOU HAVE.

41:11.260 --> 41:12.818
WELL, I JUST WANTED
TO DROP SOMETHING BY

41:12.870 --> 41:14.690
BEFORE I VISIT MORGAN
IN THE HOSPITAL.
WHAT'S THAT?

41:14.740 --> 41:17.834
MEET YOUR NEW FIREDOG.

41:17.870 --> 41:20.532
LADY GODIVA.

41:20.570 --> 41:22.003

OH, YEAH,
LOOK AT THAT.

41:24.880 --> 41:26.848
NOW I'VE ALREADY CLEARED IT
WITH THE NEW FIRE CHIEF.

41:26.880 --> 41:27.847
YOU JUST GOTTA WALK HIM,
FEED HIM,

41:27.880 --> 41:29.575
CLEAN UP AFTER HIM
AND WHATNOT.

41:29.620 --> 41:31.611
HE NEEDS EYEDROPS AT 2:00,

41:31.650 --> 41:32.878
AND HE MAY OR MAY NOT
HAVE MANGE.

41:32.920 --> 41:33.989
YOU'RE NOT LEAVING
THAT THING HERE.

41:34.020 --> 41:34.987
I'M NOT TAKING CARE
OF HIM.

41:35.020 --> 41:37.181
GUS, IF YOU DON'T TAKE HIM,

41:37.220 --> 41:39.051
CRUELLA WILL TURN HIM
INTO EARMUFFS.
