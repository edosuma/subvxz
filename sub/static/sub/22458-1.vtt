You know, these are nice.
Nice shot of you two,

00:31.487 --> 00:34.638
nice font. Just a great,
all-round package.

00:34.687 --> 00:38.043
That's the last bottle, OK?
I'm saving it.

00:38.087 --> 00:40.885

How's my hot date for tonight?

00:49.687 --> 00:51.279
Hmm? Heather?

00:51.327 --> 00:53.158
Yeah, I think I remember.

00:53.207 --> 00:55.004
Double date? Yeah, why not?

00:55.047 --> 00:57.925
 Yeah, I think I've got
just the guy.

00:57.967 --> 01:00.003
Hang on.
Mark, double date tonight?

01:00.047 --> 01:01.924
N... no.

01:01.967 --> 01:04.083
What's she like? Is she sexy?

01:04.126 --> 01:07.085
Mark, beggars can't be choosers.
She's an actual woman.

01:07.127 --> 01:09.038
It's too early. I'm not into it.

01:09.087 --> 01:10.918
No, I'm still technically married.

01:10.967 --> 01:14.164
I'm not safe to be reintroduced
into society yet.

01:14.207 --> 01:15.640
OK, I've got someone.

01:15.687 --> 01:19.726
Tell her not to get her hopes up,
but he's a safe pair of hands.

01:19.767 --> 01:22.361
Yeah, see you there.
Bye-bye, bye, bye.

01:22.407 --> 01:24.204
You're back in the game!

01:26.127 --> 01:28.800
God, no.
No, it's too early, cancel!

01:28.847 --> 01:31.441
Call back and cancel.
Tell her the whole story.

01:31.487 --> 01:33.478
Although... 

01:33.527 --> 01:36.405
Tell me more about her.
What's she like? Is she sexy?

01:36.447 --> 01:38.403
She's not too sexy, is she?

01:38.447 --> 01:41.041
She's Paula's friend.
Remember Paula? Tony's sister?

01:41.087 --> 01:43.157
Are you sure this isn't going
to be a nightmare encounter?

01:43.207 --> 01:44.879
No, Paula's cool.

01:44.927 --> 01:47.043
She's cultural.
We're going to see a play tonight.

01:47.087 --> 01:48.315
A play

01:48.367 --> 01:51.598
I know, but relax. It's all
different now. They've moved on.

01:51.647 --> 01:54.719
They use proper actors.
Americans and people off the telly.

01:54.767 --> 01:57.884
And they're all based on films,
so it's fine.

01:57.927 --> 01:59.599
We might need to tidy up a bit...

02:00.967 --> 02:06.803
...and we might have to untape the DVD
and video and TV and Sky remotes.

02:06.847 --> 02:10.122
The Megatron? But...

02:10.167 --> 02:11.395
No.

02:11.447 --> 02:13.085
It smells wrong.

02:13.127 --> 02:16.836
The Megatron doesn't say
urban free-wheelers.

02:16.887 --> 02:19.355
It says sofa masturbators,

02:19.407 --> 02:20.556
 you know.

02:22.847 --> 02:24.121
Here we are.

02:25.207 --> 02:27.437

02:27.487 --> 02:29.955
Friends of the British Museum Magazine.

Clearly, I'm not a Johnny Depp,
Tony Parsons hunk of the month.

02:33.247 --> 02:35.397
I need my props. I have my rituals.

Oh, my God, look at her!

02:47.047 --> 02:50.437
She's perfect! I love her, Jez.

02:50.487 --> 02:52.523
I don't know if I can do this.

02:52.567 --> 02:55.684
You stay, I'm going to go home.
Tell her I love her.

02:55.727 --> 02:58.639
Will you keep it together!
Just play it cool.

02:59.887 --> 03:03.641
'Maybe she's the one? My marriage
was just a warm-up for the one. '

Heather, this is Mark.

03:05.287 --> 03:06.276
Um... hi.

03:06.327 --> 03:10.366
Hi. 'Jeremy was right -
she is an actual woman. '

03:10.407 --> 03:11.726
Shall we get a drink?

03:12.727 --> 03:16.242
Um... listen, thanks for
stepping in at short notice.

03:16.287 --> 03:20.246
Oh, wow, the Samurai exhibition.
Doesn't it look amazing?

03:20.287 --> 03:23.199
Well, I'm no expert but
if it's old and it involves swords,

03:23.247 --> 03:25.602
I'm basically interested.

03:25.647 --> 03:29.003
I could get us tickets if
that wasn't incredibly forward.

03:29.047 --> 03:33.677
I'd love to cos I did a whole
course on it in college,

03:33.727 --> 03:36.002
but I checked, it's all sold out
for the next few weeks.

03:36.047 --> 03:38.117
Well, it is to the shit-munchers,

03:38.167 --> 03:40.840
but I'm actually a friend
of the British Museum.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.481
Oh, right, well...
Yeah, that would be great.

03:43.527 --> 03:46.121

closed on a second date.

03:46.167 --> 03:49.159

03:49.207 --> 03:51.846
So, great to see you...

03:51.887 --> 03:55.482
Listen, Jez, there's something I need
to tell you. It's a bit difficult.

03:55.527 --> 03:56.926
Oh, OK...

03:56.967 --> 04:00.084
The other day, I found out...
Well, I was in the clinic and...

04:00.127 --> 04:02.960
Basically, I've got a
sexually-transmitted disease.

04:03.007 --> 04:05.521
- It wasn't me.
- I didn't say it was.

04:05.567 --> 04:09.640
It's chlamydia. I was just telling you
in case you wanted to get tested.

It's symptomless? Oh, right.

04:15.327 --> 04:17.079
So what's the biggie?

04:17.127 --> 04:20.517
I mean, no-one minds if the
Invisible Man comes to dinner.

Mark, look.
Look what's bloody happened.

06:42.447 --> 06:44.677
Have we been burgled?

06:44.727 --> 06:46.638
That's exactly what I thought.

06:46.687 --> 06:50.157
Have you called the locksmith?
Have the police already been?

06:50.207 --> 06:52.163
Well, no, I thought
I'd check with you first.

06:52.207 --> 06:54.641
Cos, you know, I didn't know...
What do you call?

06:54.687 --> 06:56.518
Or do you do it all online now?

06:56.567 --> 06:57.886
Why haven't you done anything, Jeremy?

06:57.927 --> 07:00.964
I don't know. Maybe I'm in shock.
I've lost some CDs.

07:01.007 --> 07:02.360
Shit.

07:04.167 --> 07:08.604
They've... They've taken
my digital camera, my watch, my iPod!

07:08.647 --> 07:10.877
And they nicked my little bit of dope.

07:10.927 --> 07:14.715
Actually, maybe I smoked that...
They certainly nicked the PlayStation.

07:14.767 --> 07:18.157
Shall we get some pizza?
We're too stressed to cook.

07:18.207 --> 07:19.322
The PlayStation?!

07:19.367 --> 07:22.643
The memory card! I'd nearly
broken through on Medal Of Honor.

07:22.687 --> 07:27.363
They've nicked 120 hours of
quality me-time! Bloody hell!

07:27.407 --> 07:29.716
I know, everything's shit.

07:29.767 --> 07:32.725
You've lost your iPod,
I've got chlamydia. American Hot?

07:32.767 --> 07:36.680
What? You've finally caught VD?

07:36.727 --> 07:40.356
Yeah, Paula told me.
Still, it's only chlamydia. Symptomless.

07:40.407 --> 07:43.717
Still, a bit of a pisser
having to call all your exes?

07:43.767 --> 07:46.759
What? Oh, yeah...

07:46.807 --> 07:49.446
You are going to call all your exes?
Big Suze?

07:49.487 --> 07:51.284
Well, yeah, yeah, at some point.

07:51.327 --> 07:53.716
Jeremy, it makes women infertile.

07:53.767 --> 07:57.555
Yeah, all right, Dr Miriam Stoppard.
Fine, I'll do it. Jesus!

07:59.407 --> 08:02.046
Oh, my God!

08:02.087 --> 08:03.600
They did a shit.

08:03.647 --> 08:07.606
Oh, God! That is so...
Why do burglars do that?

08:07.647 --> 08:10.684
I think it's nerves
or marking their territory.

08:10.727 --> 08:13.002
Look, it's sort of all...

08:14.127 --> 08:15.560

'The big date
and she's 45 minutes late.

08:27.687 --> 08:30.724
'Great
I'm getting pitying smiles.

08:30.767 --> 08:34.157
'Still, got the phone.
You're never alone with a phone.

08:34.207 --> 08:35.434
'Look at that.

'No calls. Everyone I know
doesn't want to talk to me.

08:47.847 --> 08:50.122
It's actually quite nice to see you,
Jeremy.

08:50.167 --> 08:53.079
Yeah. So, I've been getting
in touch with all my exes

08:53.127 --> 08:55.721
because there's something
I need to tell them.

08:55.767 --> 08:58.440
But I just thought,
why not turn it into a bit of a date?

08:58.487 --> 09:00.842
Yeah? Well, I've got some news, too.

09:00.887 --> 09:02.400
Me and Johnson are over.

09:02.447 --> 09:06.122
He's looking for someone
more subservient on the internet.

09:06.167 --> 09:07.839
Is he?

09:07.887 --> 09:09.366
What a shit!

09:10.647 --> 09:11.966
So, what's your news?

09:12.007 --> 09:14.396
My news?

09:14.447 --> 09:16.756
What is my news?

09:16.807 --> 09:19.275
My news... is that...

09:19.327 --> 09:21.238
I've just got this hunch

09:21.287 --> 09:24.404
that everything's gonna
turn out OK in Iraq.

09:24.447 --> 09:25.641
Iraq?

09:25.687 --> 09:29.236
Yeah, everyone seems to have this
massive downer on the whole thing

09:29.287 --> 09:32.279
but I say,
"It ain't over till it's over, baby. "

09:32.327 --> 09:35.717
So, what shall we have to drink
to celebrate?

09:35.767 --> 09:37.359
Well, a Barolo is always nice.

09:37.407 --> 09:38.886
'Shit.

09:38.927 --> 09:42.522
'Can't ask how much. Restaurant.

'Flicking, looking. If only I knew the
name of any other wine. What's a wine?

'Ls the one Hannibal Lecter drinks
real or a joke? '

09:56.447 --> 09:58.677
A bottle of Barolo it is.

09:58.727 --> 10:00.046
Lovely!

10:01.167 --> 10:06.878
'There it is!
Oh, shit. No! 45 quid!

10:06.927 --> 10:10.476
'I've just spent 45 quid on wine. '

10:10.527 --> 10:11.960
I'm paying, I assume.

10:12.007 --> 10:14.237
<i>Well, you did invite me.</i>

10:14.287 --> 10:16.847
Of course.

10:18.007 --> 10:21.124

right there. '

10:22.727 --> 10:25.036
Oh, that is fantastic!

10:25.087 --> 10:28.124
This... this is wine.

10:28.167 --> 10:30.635
Yeah, look at what these idiots
are drinking.

10:30.687 --> 10:33.281
Look at these dicks. Huh!

10:33.327 --> 10:36.797
Obviously, it's not really delicious,
like hot chocolate or Coke,

10:36.847 --> 10:38.041
but for wine...

10:38.087 --> 10:39.964
Mwah! Brilliant.

10:40.007 --> 10:44.205
'Oh, everyone in that restaurant
knew I'd been stood up.

had an accident.</i>

I'm just the man you wanted to see. '

11:12.127 --> 11:16.279

my phone and it had your number

11:16.327 --> 11:19.558
and also the address of the restaurant,
and I didn't know where...

11:19.607 --> 11:21.359
'Almost plausible. '

11:21.407 --> 11:25.366
I cycled back this way cos I thought...
Your place is somewhere near here?

11:25.407 --> 11:26.886
Oh, right.

11:26.927 --> 11:29.202
So what do you think?
A bit late or?

11:29.247 --> 11:31.442
'I'm going to have
my pound of date. '

11:31.487 --> 11:33.443
No, it's not too late.

11:33.487 --> 11:37.116
Let's go for a drink. We were
going to have a date, let's have a date.

11:37.167 --> 11:40.842
Great! Is there anywhere nice
around... here?

11:40.887 --> 11:44.402
- No.
- Well, it's a bit late to go into town.

11:44.447 --> 11:47.086
Look, we're right by my place.

11:47.127 --> 11:51.359
We could always have a drink up there
if you didn't think it too weird.

11:51.407 --> 11:53.762
It'd be nice to see your place.

11:53.807 --> 11:55.365
'She's coming back to my place.

11:55.407 --> 11:58.319
'She trusts me. It's still possible
she stood me up,

11:58.367 --> 12:01.916
'but she almost definitely doesn't
consider me a physical threat. '

12:03.487 --> 12:06.320
I'm really glad
that we did manage to meet up,

12:06.367 --> 12:09.723
cos I don't know what
I'd have done with this, otherwise.

12:09.767 --> 12:12.281
Samurai, The World Of The Warrior!

12:12.327 --> 12:15.717
It really is the only book you need
on Samurai culture...

12:15.767 --> 12:18.201
'... that I could find
for under 15 quid. '

12:18.247 --> 12:19.760
Oh, Mark, that is thoughtful.

12:19.807 --> 12:23.925
'Oh, yeah,
getting kissed by the one! '

12:23.967 --> 12:28.802
Oh, look at this,
Jeremy left the bloody door on the...

12:28.847 --> 12:30.917
Jeremy!

12:30.967 --> 12:32.036
Hello.

12:32.087 --> 12:33.122
Hi.

12:33.167 --> 12:34.885
What are you?

12:34.927 --> 12:38.840
- I'm... I'm looking for... Kenny?
- Kenny's not here.

12:38.887 --> 12:40.957
Oh. OK, then, I'll just...

12:41.007 --> 12:44.556
- No. 'Oh, my God, what am I doing? '
- Can I?

12:44.607 --> 12:47.201
I've got asthma!
What the fuck are you doing?!

12:47.247 --> 12:50.717
'I'm wrestling with the white
working class. Morse never did this. '

12:50.767 --> 12:52.359
Just shut up!

12:52.407 --> 12:55.479
'I'm better than Morse! '

12:55.527 --> 12:58.325
- Wow, Mark! You totally took him out!
- 'Oh, yeah, baby! '

12:58.367 --> 13:00.244
Yeah, well, my home is my castle.

13:00.287 --> 13:02.357
Look... Get off, I was just...

13:02.407 --> 13:05.399
You were coming back
for what you didn't get last week!

13:05.447 --> 13:08.166
That's my bloody watch!
You've got my watch on!

13:09.247 --> 13:13.798
Police, please.
Yes, I've apprehended a burglar.

13:13.847 --> 13:16.919
Flat 5, Apollo House,
London Road, Croydon.

13:16.967 --> 13:19.959
45 minutes?! But...

13:20.007 --> 13:24.239
I'm sitting on him - is that legal?

13:24.287 --> 13:25.515
OK.

13:25.567 --> 13:29.355
Who needs a Samurai exhibition
when you get a Samurai display?

13:29.407 --> 13:31.875
Look, if you want,
we can do this another time.

13:31.927 --> 13:34.964
No, I can't leave you now.
You might need...

13:35.007 --> 13:37.646
That's great.
I think I'm OK with him,

13:37.687 --> 13:40.759
but it would be good to have
someone else there with a bottle

13:40.807 --> 13:43.844
or a spanner to bonk him
on the head with if he tries anything.

13:43.887 --> 13:45.400
This is a nice place.

13:45.447 --> 13:47.165
Thank you.

13:47.207 --> 13:49.437
If she spanners me I'll kick off.

13:49.487 --> 13:51.478
It's good to get a foot on the ladder.

13:51.527 --> 13:54.439
Plus, I've got pension provision
coming out of my arse.

13:54.487 --> 13:55.886
There's wine in the fridge.

13:55.927 --> 14:00.523
'This is turning out pretty well.
This could be a funny family story.

14:00.567 --> 14:02.922
'We met when he sat on a burglar. '

14:02.967 --> 14:05.435
Mark, what are you doing?
Who are you sitting on?

14:05.487 --> 14:06.761
It's a burglar!

14:06.807 --> 14:08.001
Oh, my God!

14:08.047 --> 14:10.720
I'm not! I got the wrong flat,
I'm looking for Kenny.

14:10.767 --> 14:13.839
I'm asthmatic.
We need money for our meter.

14:13.887 --> 14:16.765
- Oh, the plot thickens.
- He might've got the wrong flat.

14:16.807 --> 14:18.559
That's right! Take his side.

14:18.607 --> 14:21.963
You've only known me for 15 years,
whereas he's a pillar of society

14:22.007 --> 14:25.795
- Stop sitting on him. You look a dick.
- You didn't see him take him down.

14:25.847 --> 14:27.360
- Hi, I'm Heather.
- Hi.

14:27.407 --> 14:29.523
Look, Heather, can you watch him?

14:29.567 --> 14:32.320
I'll double-lock the door

14:32.367 --> 14:37.202
and then we can all go
through into the living room and just

14:37.247 --> 14:39.920
all keep an eye on him there, OK?

14:41.327 --> 14:44.797
Oh, guard duty, great vibe.
Just put him in the kitchen

14:44.847 --> 14:48.317
with a couple of Garfield's.
What you think he's going to do?

14:48.367 --> 14:52.918
I think, Jeremy, that he's going to
try and nick our stuff, all right?

14:54.167 --> 14:55.725
So...

14:55.767 --> 14:57.678
What's going on for you, man?

14:57.727 --> 14:59.922
For God's sake, Jeremy,
don't try to bond.

14:59.967 --> 15:04.085
Did you run away from home?
Are you a rent boy and everything?

15:04.127 --> 15:06.436
Fuck off, I'm looking for Kenny.

15:06.487 --> 15:11.356
Look, let's just try to continue
our evening as if he wasn't here and

15:11.407 --> 15:14.956
if he tries to escape,
I'll just have to... take him down.

15:15.007 --> 15:17.077
'I've got balls like baked potatoes. '

15:17.127 --> 15:20.039
And how would you "take him down",
just out of interest?

15:20.087 --> 15:23.477
With extreme prejudice
or On Her Majesty's Secret Service?

15:23.527 --> 15:26.917
Has anyone seen the new
Tom Hanks film with him in the?

15:26.967 --> 15:28.719
Saw it on pirate. It's shit.

15:28.767 --> 15:32.123
Look, shut up!
You are not part of this conversation!

15:33.687 --> 15:36.076
Oh, look, this is too weird.

15:36.127 --> 15:38.960
Let's lock him away somewhere
until the police arrive.

15:39.007 --> 15:42.397
Good. We're trying to relax.
He's your guest - put him in your room.

15:42.447 --> 15:44.881
- He might do a shit in there.
- I'm not gonna shit!

15:44.927 --> 15:49.842
Mark, everyone in London is not trying
to do a shit on your possessions. Relax.

15:49.887 --> 15:51.525
What's this?

15:51.567 --> 15:54.081
'Oh, the Megatron is shrinking
my massive balls. '

15:54.127 --> 15:56.595
That... What is?

15:56.647 --> 15:58.478
Did you do that? You're sick!

15:58.527 --> 16:00.085
What?

16:00.127 --> 16:02.004
Why don't we tie him up in the bath?

16:02.047 --> 16:04.436
I guess we could
tie him up in the bath but

16:04.487 --> 16:06.921
it might feel like
we'd crossed a bit of a line.

16:06.967 --> 16:10.482
Why don't we burn him with cigarettes?
He might tell you where your stuff is.

16:10.527 --> 16:11.960
We are not going to burn him.

16:12.007 --> 16:14.760
- Suze, that's horrible!
- She's only brainstorming.

16:14.807 --> 16:18.925
I think the best thing for you is if
we just stick you out on the balcony.

16:18.967 --> 16:22.243
Oh, the balcony, you serious?
It's fucking raining.

16:22.287 --> 16:24.243
What about my human rights?

16:24.287 --> 16:27.996
There's no human right to be dry.
You have a look for Kenny out there.

16:28.047 --> 16:31.244
'That felt good. Maybe I should
join the prison service. '

16:31.287 --> 16:35.405
This is quite a weird date, Jeremy. Even
weirder than when we went to Laser Quest

16:35.447 --> 16:38.484
- and you tried to hump me in the dark.
- Jeremy.

16:38.527 --> 16:41.997
Since when are you on a date
with Big Suze?

16:42.047 --> 16:45.005
What about the chlamydia,
didn't she mind?

16:45.047 --> 16:46.844
Er, no. Not really.

16:46.887 --> 16:50.038
Oh, my God, you haven't told her!
You're disgusting!

16:50.087 --> 16:53.363
According to Johnson,
they're not even definitely broken up.

16:53.407 --> 16:55.045
I won't let you do this, Jeremy!

16:55.087 --> 16:57.681
If necessary,
I'll stand physically between you.

16:57.727 --> 16:59.285
Mark...

16:59.327 --> 17:02.478
If I have to fuck you to fuck her,
then I will.

17:03.727 --> 17:07.163
So you be careful where you stand, OK?

17:08.686 --> 17:11.520
- Is he on the phone?
- Oh, God...

17:11.567 --> 17:14.080
'Guantanamo is compromised! '

17:14.127 --> 17:17.039
Give me that. Who are you phoning?

17:17.087 --> 17:21.160
<i>Just calling my mates...
All my mates. They're coming over.</i>

17:21.207 --> 17:22.765
Oh, fucking hell!

17:22.807 --> 17:24.398
Let's just get him out of here.

17:24.446 --> 17:27.040
No, the police
will be here soon, Jeremy.

17:27.087 --> 17:29.317
Any minute now our door will get
kicked down

17:29.367 --> 17:31.597
by 100 maniacs
with no stake in society.

17:31.647 --> 17:33.842
Is that your idea of a relaxing date?

17:33.887 --> 17:36.526
- We've got to tough it out.
- Fine, you're a knob.

17:36.567 --> 17:40.401
Good luck with your civilisation.
I'm barricading myself in my room.

17:40.447 --> 17:42.642
Suze!

17:42.687 --> 17:47.283
'Great, it's me protecting civilisation
again while Jeremy has sex.

17:47.327 --> 17:50.319
'Lf this was the war,
I'd be getting shot by Rommel

17:50.367 --> 17:53.245
'while he was in Paris
getting a blow-job from a Nazi. '

17:55.927 --> 17:58.202
Sorry it's been such a weird evening.

17:58.247 --> 17:59.282
Memorable, though.

17:59.327 --> 18:01.887
'Maybe I can
raise the temperature a bit? '

18:01.927 --> 18:05.761
<i>So... here we are, on bed together.</i>

18:05.807 --> 18:07.320
'Bit too much? '

18:09.927 --> 18:11.326
Look at that...

18:11.367 --> 18:14.404
Look how much bigger
my feet are than yours.

18:15.647 --> 18:17.285
I'm not boasting, they just are.

18:17.327 --> 18:19.443
'Oh, yeah, now she's getting hot'

18:19.487 --> 18:20.715
BANGING ON DOOR

18:20.767 --> 18:24.316
Oi! Come on, Mark - hurry up
and open up! Let's have you! 

18:24.367 --> 18:28.440
Mark, the barbarians are
at the gate! It's your responsibility!

18:28.487 --> 18:31.206
Ignore the banging
and the threats, Heather.

18:31.247 --> 18:34.364
Relax and have some cheese.
'Ls cheese relaxing? '

18:34.407 --> 18:38.639
They're going to get in and have
us all, Mark. Just let him go, OK?

18:38.687 --> 18:43.477
No, Jeremy, that's not
how I roll... You know that.

18:43.527 --> 18:46.325
We know he's fuckin' in there.
Let him out, you mug! 

18:46.367 --> 18:48.927
'That little dick!
If they come in here and kill me

18:48.967 --> 18:52.118
'before I get to have sex,
I'm going to be so annoyed.

18:52.167 --> 18:53.839
'Oh, fuck it! '

18:57.887 --> 19:00.560
I'll let you go,
cos I'm a really nice guy like that,

19:00.607 --> 19:03.246
but promise you won't burgle us again.
We've got a bond.

19:03.287 --> 19:05.039
'I think he likes me. '

19:05.087 --> 19:09.842
I'm going to let you go now,
but if you ever come back,

19:09.887 --> 19:15.598
then me and my mate
will go mental. OK?

19:19.207 --> 19:21.198
'OK, this is good.

19:21.247 --> 19:24.398
'He'll probably write a rap
about how amazing I am. '

19:24.447 --> 19:27.245
- 'Shit! '
- Hattie's got a massive TV.

19:27.287 --> 19:30.518
Give us your TV
or we'll fucking rush you.

19:30.567 --> 19:32.159
'Don't hurt my lovely face! '

19:32.207 --> 19:35.961
'God, she's lovely. But
how do I take it to the next level?

19:36.007 --> 19:38.919
'Boast about the size of my hands?

19:38.967 --> 19:42.880
'Tell her she might be the one?
What have I got to lose? '

19:42.927 --> 19:47.443
Well, it's been fun.
I'm really glad we did meet up, but...

19:47.487 --> 19:48.476
Maybe I should...

19:48.527 --> 19:50.483
Yeah, I guess you probably should.

19:50.527 --> 19:52.085
But there is the mob,

19:52.127 --> 19:57.281
so the mob probably means
you can't actually go just yet.

19:57.327 --> 19:58.999
Shall I top you up? 'Thanks, mob. '

19:59.047 --> 20:00.036
THUMP

20:00.087 --> 20:01.725
 Fuck! Shit! Careful!

20:01.767 --> 20:02.995
 Quick, let's go, boys.

20:04.847 --> 20:07.202
What the?!
What's going on, Jeremy?!

20:07.247 --> 20:09.283
He escaped, he overpowered me.
They got in.

20:09.327 --> 20:11.283
Stop! Stop, thieves!

20:11.327 --> 20:12.680
Fuck off, clean shirt!

20:12.727 --> 20:15.878
THEY LAUGH

20:18.807 --> 20:22.322
The front door was locked!
You let them in, didn't you, Jeremy?

20:22.367 --> 20:25.006
- No.
- Then how did he open the door?!

20:25.047 --> 20:27.720
Well, maybe you should
chase them down, Mark.

20:27.767 --> 20:30.918
Maybe if your date saw you beating
up a whole gang of children,

20:30.967 --> 20:32.286
that would get her hot.

20:32.327 --> 20:35.717
'Right, you shit.
It's mutually-assured destruction! '

20:35.767 --> 20:38.600
Suze, I'm afraid
I have to inform you

20:38.647 --> 20:42.560
that Jeremy has or may have
a sexually transmitted disease.

20:42.607 --> 20:44.882
- I'm sorry I had to tell you...
- Shut up!

20:44.927 --> 20:46.280
Is it AIDS?

20:46.327 --> 20:49.478
Of course it's not AIDS.
This isn't the '80s.

20:49.527 --> 20:54.555
It's the best STD. Just cute, old,
mostly symptomless chlamydia.

20:54.607 --> 20:56.518
And I haven't even definitely...

20:56.567 --> 20:59.843
Chlamydia?! When were you
going to tell me, Jeremy?

20:59.887 --> 21:05.200
I don't know. Probably...
I was going to tell you, sensitively,

21:05.247 --> 21:07.124
during the next little bit of time,

21:07.167 --> 21:09.727
until he just blurted it all out.

21:09.767 --> 21:12.725
Look, Suze, no...! Suze!

21:12.767 --> 21:14.359
Don't go!

21:14.407 --> 21:15.726
You can't go.

21:15.767 --> 21:17.246
Mark, I need to go.

21:17.287 --> 21:18.766
The police will be here any minute,

21:18.807 --> 21:21.605
<i>and I'm not telling them
I let the burglar go. That's your job.</i>

21:21.647 --> 21:23.717
- You're an accessory to the crime.
- Bollocks!

21:23.767 --> 21:27.521
Jeremy, if you try anything,
I will take you down. I'm not afraid.

21:27.567 --> 21:30.877
Ooh! I can't wait to see this.
What are you going to do?

21:32.567 --> 21:35.639
Oh, my God! What are you doing?

21:35.687 --> 21:37.405
Are you putting your hand on me?

21:37.447 --> 21:40.166
Are you having a fight with me?
Are you fighting me?

21:40.207 --> 21:42.004
I'm doing what I've got to do.

21:44.007 --> 21:46.077
- I'm going to go, Mark.
- No, Jeremy.

21:46.127 --> 21:48.357
My God, you are!

21:48.407 --> 21:51.126
You are fighting me! This is incredible!

21:51.167 --> 21:53.203
You are putting your foot behind me

21:53.247 --> 21:55.636
and you're pushing me
down towards the floor!

21:55.687 --> 21:57.996
Finally, you're restraining me!

21:58.047 --> 22:02.279
OK, I'm not going to hurt you. I'm just
keeping you here till the police arrive.

22:02.327 --> 22:04.636
This is...
Why hasn't this happened before?

22:04.687 --> 22:06.917
This is what it's all been
leading towards!

22:06.967 --> 22:08.719
I'm confiscating your keys.

22:08.767 --> 22:12.043
Have a good rootle around -
you never know what you might find.

22:12.087 --> 22:13.076
Mark, Mark...

22:13.127 --> 22:16.597
I'm not sure how much more there is
I can do here, so I might head off.

22:16.647 --> 22:18.877
No, no, no, we're having a date.

22:18.927 --> 22:20.758
We can still date.
You owe me a date.

22:20.807 --> 22:23.162
We've had our date, Mark.
We've had half an hour date.

22:23.207 --> 22:26.040
20 minutes, it's too soon.

22:26.087 --> 22:28.840
You can't go yet.
I won't let you go.

22:28.887 --> 22:31.526
I think it might take the edge off
the evening if I'm being held hostage!

22:31.567 --> 22:34.957
Look, I wanted to tell you something.

22:35.007 --> 22:39.125
Nothing's going to happen. We're not
a good fit. You're a weird guy.

22:39.167 --> 22:40.361
<i>He is a weird guy.</i>

22:40.407 --> 22:41.999
I tried to let you down gently with
the phone story but

22:42.047 --> 22:45.278
now I'm tired and I'm going home.

22:45.327 --> 22:47.318
What did you want to tell me?

22:47.367 --> 22:50.962
I thought that... you might be...

22:51.007 --> 22:55.717
the one, but... but...
I guess probably not, so...

22:55.767 --> 22:57.325
Good night.

22:57.367 --> 22:58.686
'Night.

23:03.687 --> 23:05.200
She might be the one.

23:05.247 --> 23:06.885
Fuck off, Jeremy.

23:06.927 --> 23:08.758
'I'm his one. '

23:16.407 --> 23:18.284
<i>Paranoia, paranoia</i>

23:18.327 --> 23:21.319
<i>Everybody's comin' to get me</i>

23:21.367 --> 23:24.245
<i>Just say you never met me</i>

23:24.287 --> 23:29.441
<i>I'm runnin' underground
with the moles, diggin' holes</i>
