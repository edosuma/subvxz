00:07.280 --> 00:12.400
Painting of a Gothic castle,
artist unknown, circa 1920s.

00:12.760 --> 00:17.959
Oil on canvas, 20-by-28. Miss Franklin,
where did you say you got this?

00:18.120 --> 00:23.638
I inherited it a few months ago. But
it's been in my family for generations.

00:24.120 --> 00:27.157
The composition is so unusual.

00:27.320 --> 00:30.073
The artist used pure colour straight
from the tube and then varnished

00:30.240 --> 00:33.994
- each layer over and...
- I'm sorry for interrupting.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.997
But do I really need to be here?

00:36.160 --> 00:40.517
No, of course not. It's just that most
people prefer to be at an appraisal,

00:40.680 --> 00:42.591
especially when they plan
on selling the piece.

00:42.760 --> 00:46.036
- It's just that I'm kind of in a hurry.
- Say no more.

00:46.200 --> 00:49.272
Just sign at the bottom,
and you are free to go.

00:49.440 --> 00:53.353
Thank you. So how long
do you think it'll take to sell it?

00:53.560 --> 00:56.632
Well, I'll need to see ownership
records before I can do anything.

00:56.800 --> 01:00.076
I'll send you everything I have.
So is that all, then?

01:00.240 --> 01:02.071
No, since you definitely wanna sell
the piece,

01:02.240 --> 01:05.152
I'll need to confirm its authenticity,
its physical condition.

01:05.319 --> 01:07.151
So if you'll just sign at the bottom,

01:07.360 --> 01:09.157
that will let us go ahead
and x-ray the piece.

01:09.760 --> 01:11.751
Done.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.754
- Anything else?
- Um...

01:15.320 --> 01:18.949
Well, yes, Miss Franklin. I would really
like the time to research this.

01:19.160 --> 01:21.037
That way I can get you the best price.

01:21.200 --> 01:26.194
Look, I appreciate
your professionalism. I really do.

01:26.360 --> 01:28.920
But I'm not interested in getting
the best price.

01:29.080 --> 01:33.835
I just want you to sell that painting
as soon as you can, all right?

01:34.840 --> 01:37.149
- Good night, Miss Halliwell.
- Good night.

01:47.920 --> 01:50.832
Piper, it was an accident.
It's not like I borrowed Prue's car

01:51.040 --> 01:53.679
- so I could drive it into a pole.
- How bad's the damage?

01:53.840 --> 01:56.638
Not bad, but maybe expensive,
which is why I need a favour.

01:56.800 --> 01:59.439
If you're calling to borrow money,
I don't have any.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.152
No, it's not about money.
It's just... I don't want you to tell Prue.

02:04.320 --> 02:07.517
She's been so supportive,
and I don't wanna lose her trust again.

02:07.680 --> 02:11.116
- You mean you haven't told her?
- Well, not yet, but I have a plan.

02:11.280 --> 02:12.508
Phoebe, you have to tell her.

02:12.680 --> 02:14.955
It's her car, and you don't have
the money to fix it.

02:15.120 --> 02:17.759
But I will have the money to fix it.
I'm at this company called

02:17.920 --> 02:20.912
Web San Francisco. It's
an interactive network on the Internet.

02:21.120 --> 02:22.678
And I faxed them my résumé
this morning,

02:22.840 --> 02:24.398
and they wanna meet
with me tonight.

02:24.560 --> 02:26.869
I've gotta go, but I don't wanna
be in the middle of this.

02:27.040 --> 02:30.077
- Just tell her, okay?
- If I don't get the job, I will tell her.

02:34.120 --> 02:35.792
[SIGHS]

02:47.720 --> 02:51.998
Hello, I'm Phoebe Halliwell.
I have an appointment.

02:55.120 --> 02:56.439
Thanks.

02:57.080 --> 03:00.231
All these people, they're here
for the interview too, aren't they?

03:00.440 --> 03:03.034
Well, you won't have any trouble
with this if you figured that out.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.158
It's an aptitude test.
You can finish it at home.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.072
Great. Great.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.358
APPLICANT 1: You won a fellowship
from the National Science Foundation?

03:15.520 --> 03:17.636
When I was at Harvard, yeah.
How'd you know?

03:17.840 --> 03:20.912
I saw it on your résumé.
I was cum laude also.

03:21.080 --> 03:22.832
APPLICANT 1: Except I was
a Ford Foundation scholar.

03:23.080 --> 03:25.389
So then you must have gone
to Stanford?

03:25.640 --> 03:27.392
Stanford? I went to Stanford.

03:29.080 --> 03:30.752
APPLICANT 2:
Intimidating, isn't it?

03:31.120 --> 03:33.350
The Good Will Huntings
or this aptitude test?

03:33.560 --> 03:37.189
Oh, who cares about linear algebra or
differential? And that test is a snap.

03:37.360 --> 03:39.191
I mean, in this day and age,
who can't write

03:39.360 --> 03:41.555
in HTML and numeric
languages, right?

03:41.720 --> 03:42.709
[CHUCKLING]

03:42.880 --> 03:43.869
Right.

03:45.840 --> 03:49.833
Yeah, that's... That's for you.

04:04.800 --> 04:06.631
What?

04:13.680 --> 04:15.352
Oh...

05:41.720 --> 05:45.156
At first I just thought that it was a
reflection off of something in the room.

05:45.400 --> 05:48.119
But then when I moved closer,
I saw a man

05:48.280 --> 05:50.589
inside the painting, in the castle.

05:50.760 --> 05:54.958
Right, but the moment I saw him,
he backed away from the window.

05:55.160 --> 05:58.436
And then there was this strange glow
that went past the window again.

05:58.600 --> 06:00.591
It was just so...

06:02.320 --> 06:03.878
- Piper?
- What?

06:04.960 --> 06:08.509
- We were talking?
- I know, about a man in a painting.

06:08.720 --> 06:12.110
Listen to this one. "Hallway
near club entrance too narrow."

06:12.280 --> 06:14.430
I thought that we had discussed
your code violations.

06:14.600 --> 06:15.953
Well, I keep finding more.

06:16.120 --> 06:18.509
The plumbing, the electrical,
the heating.

06:18.680 --> 06:20.830
- It... None of it is up to code.
- Stop.

06:21.880 --> 06:24.440
- You're obsessing.
- Well, it runs in the family.

06:25.040 --> 06:26.678
I don't obsess.

06:27.480 --> 06:32.349
I think intensely.
Anyway, I can't really help it.

06:32.560 --> 06:35.552
I mean, we've seen so many bizarre
things, why not a man in a painting?

06:35.720 --> 06:37.472
At least he's safe
from building inspectors.

06:37.720 --> 06:40.109
I can't imagine
that castle's up to code.

06:40.280 --> 06:43.556
I'm sorry, but I couldn't find anything
in the <i>Book of Shadows</i> about people

06:43.720 --> 06:46.951
who may be trapped inside paintings.
I looked everywhere.

06:47.440 --> 06:51.877
Hey, you were asleep by the time
I got home. How did your interview go?

06:54.160 --> 06:55.752
It went fine.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.073
Actually, it's still going. I have
to finish this take-home aptitude test,

07:00.240 --> 07:02.674
which I actually think
I will start right now.

07:02.840 --> 07:05.149
So I will see you guys later.

07:05.360 --> 07:06.713
- Phoebe?
PHOEBE: What?

07:06.880 --> 07:09.553
Aren't you forgetting something?
My car keys?

07:13.400 --> 07:15.868
They'd be with your car...

07:16.880 --> 07:20.395
...which is at the body shop,
having an estimate.

07:20.960 --> 07:25.909
- An estimate?
- Yeah, I bumped...

07:26.320 --> 07:30.598
No, actually I backed your car
into a pole last night.

07:31.440 --> 07:33.158
A pole?

07:34.320 --> 07:35.548
You hit a pole?

07:35.720 --> 07:38.314
Yeah, you don't even have to say it.
I know what you're thinking.

07:38.480 --> 07:41.836
How could I be so irresponsible?
How could I be so stupid?

07:42.240 --> 07:46.518
Okay, irresponsible, yes. Stupid,
no way. Where is that coming from?

07:46.680 --> 07:48.830
It's coming from the fact
that I'm the youngest sister,

07:49.000 --> 07:51.958
the one who always makes mistakes,
the one who always causes problems.

07:52.120 --> 07:54.793
I mean, if anybody were gonna back
your car into a pole

07:54.960 --> 07:57.030
and not tell you right away,
it'd be me, right?

07:57.880 --> 08:00.758
- I think I'll just be going now.
- See? Even the middle sister,

08:00.920 --> 08:03.912
the one that's supposed to stay neutral
when it comes to family problems,

08:04.080 --> 08:06.799
- checks out on this one.
- Yes, you're right. You're on your own.

08:06.960 --> 08:09.428
Well, leave me out of it too.
I don't wanna argue with you.

08:09.600 --> 08:12.956
- I just wanna find a cab.
- Well, whatever it costs,

08:13.120 --> 08:15.680
I will pay for the damages.
And whatever the cab costs,

08:15.840 --> 08:17.592
I will pay for that too.

08:20.760 --> 08:23.877
- What just happened here?
- I don't know anything about anything.

08:24.080 --> 08:26.150
- I'm gonna go see Dan.
- Piper!

08:26.320 --> 08:29.835
Just forget about the car.
What about the man in the painting?

08:30.200 --> 08:34.352
Well, unless he's real and screaming
for help, forget about him.

08:34.520 --> 08:37.352
We shouldn't go looking for trouble.
We have enough around here.

08:37.960 --> 08:40.110
I'm going next door.

08:48.680 --> 08:50.671
- Dan.
- Good morning.

08:50.880 --> 08:53.792
- I'm sorry to bother you.
- No, you're not bothering me, unless

08:54.080 --> 08:57.550
- you refuse to hand over my paper.
- Oh, all yours.

08:57.720 --> 09:01.952
- Thanks. You wanna come in?
- No, no, really,

09:02.160 --> 09:05.232
I just stopped by to ask a quick favour.
My club received a visit

09:05.400 --> 09:07.755
- from the DBI last night...
- And you got code violations.

09:07.960 --> 09:10.679
I have the <i>War and Peace</i>
of code violations.

09:10.880 --> 09:14.475
And you were thinking what?
Neighbour Dan, he's in construction,

09:14.880 --> 09:18.031
- maybe he could help, huh?
- Of course I'd pay you something.

09:18.640 --> 09:21.916
JENNY: Uncle Dan, I'm late. Hey, Piper.
- Hi, Jenny.

09:22.080 --> 09:26.517
See you later, Uncle Dan.
And don't forget your promise.

09:27.920 --> 09:32.198
Okay, then, I'll tell you what I can do.
I'll check out the code violations,

09:32.360 --> 09:35.272
see how serious they really are
if you will help me with the promise

09:35.440 --> 09:38.159
- I made Jenny.
- Deal. Wait, what's the promise?

09:38.320 --> 09:42.199
She needs help with a paper. It's...
It's for bio class. You know, something

09:42.400 --> 09:46.473
- with the human reproductive system.
- Oh, you mean sex.

09:47.440 --> 09:50.477
It's just way too awkward for me
to talk to my niece about.

09:50.680 --> 09:54.309
Yeah. Sure, not to worry,
I have plenty of experience.

09:54.880 --> 10:00.398
- Really? With sex?
- No, I mean, talking about it.

10:02.880 --> 10:04.279
Yeah.

10:07.920 --> 10:09.876
So was there a problem
with any

10:10.040 --> 10:11.792
of the ownership records
that I sent over?

10:11.960 --> 10:13.632
No, everything's in order.

10:13.960 --> 10:15.916
Then I'm not sure why you wanted
to meet with me.

10:16.080 --> 10:19.550
Look, Miss Franklin, I know that you
don't really wanna be here,

10:19.720 --> 10:25.078
so I'll just be perfectly honest. There is
something strange about that painting.

10:26.160 --> 10:28.549
- Have you seen him?
- Him?

10:29.200 --> 10:32.590
- That's how it all starts, you know.
- What do you mean?

10:32.760 --> 10:36.070
At first, you see him...

10:37.400 --> 10:38.799
...the man inside the painting.

10:39.760 --> 10:45.039
At least you think you see him,
but he just... He disappears so fast.

10:46.720 --> 10:49.951
And you start to think about it, but
it doesn't make any sense. I mean,

10:51.200 --> 10:56.035
how could a man be inside a painting?
And then you see him again.

10:56.560 --> 10:58.596
This time longer.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.352
And now you're sure.

11:03.520 --> 11:06.318
So you think that the painting
is haunted by a ghost?

11:07.000 --> 11:11.312
Oh, no, no,
I think he's definitely alive.

11:12.120 --> 11:14.588
I think he's trapped inside.

11:16.120 --> 11:19.590
- Do you know who he is?
- No, I have no idea.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.272
Nobody does.

11:23.960 --> 11:27.748
Look, all I know is that
if I don't get rid of that painting,

11:28.000 --> 11:30.878
I'm gonna end up just like everybody
else in my family who ever owned it.

11:31.080 --> 11:33.071
- I'm gonna be completely insane.
- Miss Franklin...

11:33.240 --> 11:35.196
No, you've only seen the beginning,
Miss Halliwell.

11:35.400 --> 11:39.712
Just trust me when I tell you
it's only gonna get worse.

11:48.880 --> 11:54.318
Spirits send the words from all...

11:54.480 --> 11:55.469

11:55.640 --> 11:57.278
PIPER:
It's me. Can I come in?

11:57.440 --> 11:59.795
Piper, I really just wanna be alone
right now.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.633
I won't stay long, promise.

12:03.560 --> 12:05.630
All right, just give me a sec.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.394
Okay, you can come in now.

12:15.880 --> 12:19.998
I just wanted to tell you
the body shop called.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.351
Yeah, I know, I heard the message,
1,200 bucks.

12:22.520 --> 12:25.876
- Did you tell Prue?
- I didn't have to. She already knew.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.473
She called the body shop herself.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.551
That's why I have got
to get this job, Piper.

12:29.760 --> 12:31.796
It's the only way that I could pay
for the damages.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.558
The only way I can make
things right.

12:33.760 --> 12:35.637
All the more reason
you just should've told her.

12:35.840 --> 12:38.274
Okay, well, maybe a smarter person
would've figured that out.

12:38.600 --> 12:42.036
Then again, a smart person wouldn't
have backed the car into a pole.

12:42.280 --> 12:45.272
A smart person would've realised
that it was a $1,200 pole.

12:45.480 --> 12:49.837
That's because smart people don't do
stupid things, only stupid people do.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.719
- Phoebe, I didn't mean to upset you.
- I know.

12:53.080 --> 12:56.277
- Maybe we should just talk later.
- Okay.

12:57.560 --> 13:00.677
- You sure you're gonna be okay?
- Yeah. Why?

13:00.840 --> 13:03.479
Phoebe, I know you think getting
this job is the answer, but please,

13:03.640 --> 13:06.438
- just don't do anything...
- What, stupid?

13:06.600 --> 13:09.672
No, just don't do
anything I wouldn't do.

13:11.880 --> 13:13.677
Don't worry, I won't.

13:17.360 --> 13:19.669
You would never cast a smart spell.

13:20.920 --> 13:21.955
Okay.

13:24.400 --> 13:27.756
For 24 hours, from 7 to 7,
I will understand all meaning

its authenticity?

It did a lot more than that.
Check out the x-ray.

It's got definitive underwriting
on the canvas.

40:29.560 --> 40:32.233
