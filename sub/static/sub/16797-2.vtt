MAN: Walter Blunt,
what you doing
on the bus?

00:03.738 --> 00:05.004
Trying to be
a responsible citizen.

00:05.006 --> 00:08.674
How do you know Walter?
He's my sex and
love addict sponsor.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.776
Oh, shit, I just spit
in your mouth.

00:10.778 --> 00:13.278
My thing is to wear
no underwear,

00:13.280 --> 00:14.980
then I ride the M52 bus.

00:14.982 --> 00:16.482
And I just hope
somebody sees

00:16.484 --> 00:19.385
what I have hidden up here,
my noodle and my wontons.

00:19.387 --> 00:20.552
What about Monday's
Medicine Cabinet?

00:20.554 --> 00:24.056
How about this, Walter?
Half a million Americans
die of colon cancer.

00:24.058 --> 00:26.992
It's hereditary,
so Jim will have
to have a colonoscopy

00:26.994 --> 00:29.862
and I say why not make it
into a live broadcast?

00:29.864 --> 00:30.896
What? Mommy.

00:30.898 --> 00:33.465
This is Shelly Tinkle
doing her thing.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.467
Cornelia White.
Find out if she's in LA.

CELIA: <i> Why, Walter?</i>
WALTER: <i> 30 years ago,</i>
<i> I was madly in love with her.</i>

You know, you were
the love of my life.

I'm so sorry, Walter!
I love to play soccer.

01:20.014 --> 01:21.280
It was instinct.

01:21.282 --> 01:24.249
Sylvia, darling,
are you all right?

01:24.251 --> 01:25.317
I'm fine.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.852

01:34.728 --> 01:38.430
JIM: Not so good.
I feel like a water balloon
with diarrhea.

01:38.432 --> 01:41.733
Oh, you poor thing.
You're suffering.

01:41.735 --> 01:45.571
Can I come in?
Okay, just no judgment.

01:45.573 --> 01:50.275
Look at you, hard at work
at the broadcast.
We're gonna win a Peabody.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.577
Yeah, well,
look at this.

01:51.579 --> 01:57.483
It says one out of every
1,400 colonoscopies
lead to injury

01:57.485 --> 02:01.520
including
a punctured colon,
sometimes death.

02:01.522 --> 02:04.189
What if I get
a punctured colon, Celia?

02:04.191 --> 02:06.925
Well, then
you'd have a semicolon.

02:06.927 --> 02:08.293
That's not funny.
Why would you say that?

02:08.295 --> 02:11.263
No, look, I know
that you're concerned
and you should be,

02:11.265 --> 02:14.867
but the proctologist
who's seeing you
is world-class.

02:14.869 --> 02:16.869
Yeah, but who becomes
a proctologist?

02:16.871 --> 02:19.171
Imagine looking
at rectums all day long.

02:19.173 --> 02:23.175
You'd have to be
an unfeeling person.
How can I trust this man?

02:23.177 --> 02:27.446
Yeah, but maybe
every anus is different
like so much in nature.

02:27.448 --> 02:29.648
I mean, that would
keep it interesting.

02:30.016 --> 02:31.617
I wonder what proctologists
dream about.

02:31.619 --> 02:33.018
You're not listening
to me, Celia.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.920
(STAMMERS)
I want to call this off.

02:34.922 --> 02:37.055

that nothing bad
happens, okay?

03:05.084 --> 03:06.285

I've got porridge
on my fencing tunic, Harry.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.718
It's because
you're distracted, Major.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.454
I thought we said
no cell phones during meals.

03:42.456 --> 03:46.291
Yes, I know, Harry.
But I don't understand.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.700
I can't say, sir.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.168
Perhaps she's on
a digital diet.

03:56.170 --> 03:58.904
Oh, that's nonsense, Harry.
She's perfectly fit.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.340
Sylvia, darling,
what do you think?

04:01.342 --> 04:02.474
This is the woman
from your past

04:02.476 --> 04:07.246
who you kissed
Friday night,
but didn't make love to?

04:08.748 --> 04:09.982
Yes, that's quite correct.

04:09.984 --> 04:13.051
Whom you kissed
and didn't make
love to, sweetheart.

04:13.053 --> 04:17.422
Harry, I've asked you
not to correct my grammar.

04:17.424 --> 04:20.892
It undermines
my confidence as an
aspiring screenwriter.

04:20.894 --> 04:23.562
I'm sorry.
I don't know
what I was thinking.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.597
My mother
used to do it to me.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.531
I don't want
to be my mother.

Look, I'm sorry,
uh, can we just focus
on my Cornelia situation?

04:30.871 --> 04:34.906
I've sent flower emojis,
six regular texts,

04:34.908 --> 04:38.343
and a selfie
that Harry took of me.

04:39.312 --> 04:41.079
Did I overreach?

04:42.181 --> 04:44.583
Yes.
Oh, shit.

04:44.585 --> 04:47.019
But you have
to give her space.

04:47.353 --> 04:49.288

04:49.290 --> 04:51.890
You have to let her
come to you.

for 30 years.

to comb it on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday.

But... (SIGHS)
How are you feeling?

about the lumps in your
breast all weekend.

05:17.384 --> 05:19.084
Why? There weren't
any lumps.

05:19.086 --> 05:21.687
I know,
but that was Friday
and I was thinking...

05:21.689 --> 05:23.055
This came to you
from India.

05:23.057 --> 05:25.624
Indiana?
No, India.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.360
God, she gets angry
so easily.

05:28.362 --> 05:30.662
I really thought
she said Indiana.

05:30.664 --> 05:31.296
What is it?

05:31.298 --> 05:34.199
It's from my cousin
in Jaipur.

05:38.438 --> 05:39.471

06:09.336 --> 06:11.269

calling you yesterday.

06:11.271 --> 06:12.237
Maybe there is
a higher power.

06:12.239 --> 06:15.340
I'm sorry. I get
so many calls,
you know?

06:15.342 --> 06:17.609
Anyway,
how have you been?

06:17.611 --> 06:20.011
We haven't seen you
since the party.

06:20.013 --> 06:20.879

You're my

06:23.517 --> 06:25.183
You supposed to be
looking after me.

06:25.185 --> 06:27.252

to answer
the damn phone.

06:27.254 --> 06:27.886

to be your sponsor.

06:30.657 --> 06:32.724

I'm homeless.

06:44.338 --> 06:46.037

That's terrible.

06:46.039 --> 06:48.774

My job, my Camry.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.277
And I mean I really
did lose it.

06:52.279 --> 06:56.081
I parked it someplace
and for the life of me
I can't remember where.

06:56.083 --> 06:59.618
But that's because
I was drinking
and acting out.

06:59.620 --> 07:02.220
A Camry?
Oh, dear.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.162
Oh, that's my valet.

10:33.065 --> 10:35.133
Well, Walter, yes...

10:35.135 --> 10:36.034
Cheers.
Cheers.

10:36.036 --> 10:40.005
I wanted to meet you
out here so that
we could speak safely.

10:40.007 --> 10:42.440
I think
I'm being followed.

10:42.442 --> 10:46.277
And my phone
and my email
may be compromised.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.946
That sounds serious.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.948
What have you
got involved with?

10:49.950 --> 10:51.983
A colleague of mine
at <i> The Guardian</i>

10:51.985 --> 10:53.018
came to LA
several weeks ago.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.587
He was working
on a massive
climate change story,

10:55.589 --> 10:58.056
going around
the world to different
drought regions...

10:58.058 --> 11:00.925
Uh, Somalia,
Northeast China,
Syria.

11:00.927 --> 11:05.096
And now LA.
Well, fascinating.
I would like to meet him.

11:05.098 --> 11:07.432
Well,
that's not possible.

11:07.434 --> 11:08.366
He's dead.

11:08.368 --> 11:09.968
The cause of death
was listed

11:09.970 --> 11:12.771
as autoerotic
asphyxiation.

11:12.773 --> 11:13.672
Really?
Mmm.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.974
I've never understood
its appeal.

11:15.976 --> 11:19.377
But then I don't like
eating by myself.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.312
Walter,
that's not it.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.682
I'm afraid
it was murder.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.083
Who killed him?
I don't know.

11:25.085 --> 11:28.787
He was on to something
very corrupt here in LA
with the water

11:28.789 --> 11:30.188
and got himself killed.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.692
Now I think
they're on to me.

11:34.293 --> 11:36.861
I'm so glad
you came to me.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.963
I am going
to help you in this.

11:38.965 --> 11:41.866
Harry, we're going
back to the office.

11:41.868 --> 11:44.102
Uh, forget about
the oysters.

11:45.104 --> 11:47.038
Oh, for...

11:47.239 --> 11:50.341
(SIGHS)
Oi, watch where
you're going, sir.

11:50.343 --> 11:53.178
This is an awfully big
artificial lake.

11:53.180 --> 11:54.946
Sorry,
I'm nearsighted.

11:54.948 --> 11:57.215
I thought
this was the 101.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.717
The...

12:01.554 --> 12:04.856
ROSALIE: I really
appreciate this, Celia.

12:04.858 --> 12:07.659
With Teddy away,
my feet are suffering.

12:07.661 --> 12:11.096
I don't mind.
My feet get so much
attention from Jim,

12:11.098 --> 12:13.765
it's nice to be
on the other side.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.366
Dear Jim.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.335
Dear Jim.

12:17.337 --> 12:18.870
(SIGHS)
I'm worried about him.

12:18.872 --> 12:22.107
The colonoscopy.
No, it's not that.

12:22.109 --> 12:24.075
He thinks he loves me.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.376
What's wrong with that?

12:25.378 --> 12:28.246
Well, he doesn't
even know me,
not yet.

12:28.248 --> 12:31.149
Oh, I'm full of
ugly secrets, Rosalie.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.350
That's normal.

12:32.352 --> 12:35.453
No man has ever
seen me for who I am.

12:35.455 --> 12:38.890
They'd be too scared.
I'd be too scared.

12:38.892 --> 12:41.726
Maybe it was wrong
to start an office
romance with Jim.

12:41.728 --> 12:45.063
Of course it was wrong,
but that's okay.

12:45.065 --> 12:45.764
That's life.

12:45.766 --> 12:48.800
We go from mistake
to mistake.

12:48.802 --> 12:50.268
It's how we learn.

12:50.270 --> 12:54.706
But if we're always
making mistakes,
what are we learning?

12:56.642 --> 12:59.744
Jim Stone.
Jim Stone.

12:59.746 --> 13:02.413
Jim Stone.
Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.

13:02.415 --> 13:02.981
Jim, Jim, Jim.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.583
Jimmy Stone.
James Stone.
Jimmy.

13:05.585 --> 13:07.218
Jimmy Stone.
Jimmy Jims.

13:07.220 --> 13:10.688
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
HERSCHEL: Hey, what the hell
is going on in there?

13:10.690 --> 13:12.257
(SIGHS)

13:14.493 --> 13:16.861
(SIGHS)
Who are you
talking to in here?

13:16.863 --> 13:19.364
Wait, wait a sec.
Have we met?

13:19.366 --> 13:20.532
Mmm-mmm.

13:20.534 --> 13:21.132
I know you.

13:21.134 --> 13:24.969
You spit a mini wiener
in my mouth
at Walter's party.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.705
Ah, that's right.
(LAUGHS)

13:27.707 --> 13:31.109
Oh, my God, I felt
so terrible about that.
That was so disgusting.

13:31.111 --> 13:35.046
Good news is,
you're the guy getting
a colonoscopy, right?

13:35.048 --> 13:35.513
Yep.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.816
Well, if that hot dog
has given you cancer,

13:37.818 --> 13:39.284
they gonna catch it
right away.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.853
What? Cancer?
Don't, don't say that.

13:41.855 --> 13:44.455
Jesus Christ.
Cancer?

13:44.457 --> 13:45.990
(GASPS)
Oh, my bad.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.926
I... You know what?
The news on

13:47.928 --> 13:49.627
processed meat
in hot dogs is bad

13:49.629 --> 13:51.462
and that's all I've been
eating for years.

13:51.464 --> 13:54.332
Yeah, it's scary.
I don't want to die.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.701
I recently
just fell in love.

13:56.703 --> 13:59.671
Oh, shit.
Love.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.506
That is so painful.
You know what?

14:01.508 --> 14:04.876
You need, like,
a pill or something
for your nerves?

14:05.277 --> 14:06.578
Yeah, what do you got?

14:06.580 --> 14:07.478
Well...
(CHUCKLES)

14:07.480 --> 14:12.050
I have ecstasy,
mescaline, Valium.

14:12.718 --> 14:14.152
Oh, what,
what's that?

14:14.154 --> 14:17.188
Um, you know what?
This might be
the mescaline.

14:17.190 --> 14:20.058
And you know what?
You need Valium.

14:20.492 --> 14:23.194
Please don't tell Walter
about these pills.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.729
He's my sponsor
and I wouldn't...

14:24.731 --> 14:27.665
CELIA: Ready, Jim?
We have to go to
the hospital now.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.567
Hey, Stretch.

14:30.102 --> 14:32.003
Mmm-hmm.

14:32.271 --> 14:34.873
Did I just swallow
mescaline?

14:34.875 --> 14:36.341
Yeah.

14:39.912 --> 14:41.713
(EXHALES)

14:43.015 --> 14:45.550
And this is our very
democratic kitchen

14:45.552 --> 14:49.387
where the staff gather
to discuss stories.

14:49.688 --> 14:52.891
Well, this really is
very impressive, Walter.

14:52.893 --> 14:56.094
I do think you should
have more posters
of yourself, though.

14:56.096 --> 14:59.430
That's what
I keep saying.
Hmm.

14:59.632 --> 15:03.001

(LAUGHING)

15:03.369 --> 15:05.970
WALTER:
This is my office.

15:06.405 --> 15:07.505
(LAUGHING)

15:07.507 --> 15:09.674
WALTER: Herschel!
Turn that off!
Whoa!

15:09.676 --> 15:11.276
Walter.
(GROANS)

15:11.278 --> 15:13.945
Okay, I am sorry.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.013
(HERSCHEL PANTS)

15:15.015 --> 15:17.448
I'm weak.
I slipped already,
Walter, I'm sorry.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.817
Harry, will you take
Herschel to the
conference room?

15:19.819 --> 15:21.719
Yes, Major, right away.
I swear, you know
what I'm gonna do?

15:21.721 --> 15:25.356
Come on.
Is I'm gonna work
on all the steps...

15:25.358 --> 15:26.057
Sorry, sir.

15:26.059 --> 15:29.727
I am so sorry,
Cornelia.
No, no, it's...

15:29.729 --> 15:33.798
A neighbor of mine
made a pornographic
parody of...

15:33.800 --> 15:36.768
You know what?
Never mind. Drink?

15:36.770 --> 15:37.735
Oh, yes.
I need one.

15:37.737 --> 15:41.172
Well, you make
yourself at home.
The bathroom is through there.

15:41.174 --> 15:44.242
We have secure Wi-Fi
and telephones.

15:44.244 --> 15:46.844
And when I have
finished my broadcast,

15:46.846 --> 15:52.517
you are gonna help me
to understand everything
that is going on.

15:52.519 --> 15:54.218
You're in
the trenches still.

15:54.220 --> 15:56.888
Corruption,
intrigue.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.791
To getting
your hands dirty.

16:00.292 --> 16:00.692
Hmm.

16:00.694 --> 16:03.895
DOCTOR: Okay,
let's try this again,
please, on three.

16:03.897 --> 16:06.898
One, two, three.
(WHISPERS)
Two...

16:07.933 --> 16:09.534
No, no, no.
I'm sorry.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.703
Mr. Stone,
you're gonna need
to relax, okay?

16:11.705 --> 16:12.837
It shouldn't be
this difficult.

16:12.839 --> 16:14.472
I feel like
you might be clenching.

16:14.474 --> 16:18.476
But I am relaxed
and everything feels
so amazing.

16:18.478 --> 16:22.113
My gown,
the cold lube,

16:22.314 --> 16:23.214
your thrusting.

16:23.216 --> 16:25.783
Are you all right, Jim?
You're acting very funny.

16:25.785 --> 16:27.618
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm okay.

16:27.620 --> 16:30.321
I'm just, you know,
a little... (CHUCKLES)

16:30.323 --> 16:31.889
(CLEARS THROAT)
Never mind.

16:31.891 --> 16:34.692
Okay, why don't
we take a deep breath

16:34.694 --> 16:36.761
and let's try it again?

16:37.896 --> 16:38.896
Try to open up, Jim.

16:38.898 --> 16:42.200
Like a flower
in the sun.

16:42.202 --> 16:44.302
Or like the mouth
of a baby bird.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.604
I don't think
that these are
helpful metaphors, Shelly.

16:46.606 --> 16:47.939
I know what
I'm talking about.

16:47.941 --> 16:49.674
Yeah, I read a memoir
on sodomy, so...

16:49.676 --> 16:51.609

On three, please.
One, two, three.

16:51.611 --> 16:54.345
Come on, Jim.
You can do this.
I know you can.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.980
Okay.
DOCTOR:
God damn it.

16:55.982 --> 16:57.615
Okay, again.
On three.

16:57.617 --> 16:59.984
Come on.
One, two, three.

16:59.986 --> 17:01.953
Oh!

17:01.955 --> 17:04.088
Mmm. Uh...

17:07.760 --> 17:09.060
We're in.

17:09.062 --> 17:09.861
Yes! Oh...

17:09.863 --> 17:13.297
Yes. I'm so happy
you have so much...

17:13.299 --> 17:14.766
Mmm... Ugh.

17:14.768 --> 17:18.269
You'll start with
the immigration bill.

17:18.271 --> 17:19.237
Then a commercial.

17:19.239 --> 17:22.540
Then we'll go
to the hospital
for Jim's colonoscopy.

17:22.542 --> 17:25.810
Yeah, got it.

Are you okay?

17:25.812 --> 17:27.178

Yes.

17:29.616 --> 17:32.650
I feel like a fool
in her eyes.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.852
Come on.
Why would you say that?

17:34.854 --> 17:37.688
Because she's still
a real journalist.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.657
I'm just a talking head.

17:39.659 --> 17:42.293
An easy target
for vulgar parodies.

17:42.295 --> 17:45.630
Stop it, Walter.
You're doing
important work.

17:45.632 --> 17:48.499
Jim's colonoscopy tonight
is gonna save lives.

17:48.501 --> 17:53.204
You know what?
It should be me
getting that colonoscopy.

17:53.206 --> 17:56.507
I need to get out
from behind this desk!

17:56.509 --> 17:58.609
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

17:58.611 --> 18:02.246
We'll think
of a medical procedure
for you, I promise.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.715
Like what?
I don't know.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.584

Oh, Doctor, excuse me.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.164
Off the record,
what's your stance
on anal sex?

18:20.166 --> 18:21.799
Is that something
we should be doing
every day

18:21.801 --> 18:25.403
or is it
the old moderation
in all things or...

18:25.405 --> 18:26.771
Shh! Okay.

18:26.773 --> 18:30.441

in 30 seconds.

18:40.152 --> 18:43.654
Welcome back.
Tonight in the
Medicine Cabinet

18:43.656 --> 18:46.958
we will be looking
at colorectal cancer,

18:46.960 --> 18:50.161
which is the third
most common cancer
in the United States.

18:50.163 --> 18:55.933

<i> without the usual</i>
<i> benefit of sedation.</i>

<i> Hello, Celia.</i>

19:06.746 --> 19:07.678
Hello, Walter.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.914
Celia, what is that mask
you're wearing?

19:09.916 --> 19:12.150
It looks like something
a welder might use.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.218
I'm told this is called
a splash guard.

19:14.220 --> 19:16.821
And this is the
splash zone.

19:16.823 --> 19:17.355
Ah.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.357
This is
Dr. Rudy Kamper,

19:19.359 --> 19:22.293
who will be performing
the colonoscopy for us
this evening.

19:22.295 --> 19:25.263
Yes, hello, uh, Mr. Blunt.
I'm a very big fan

19:25.265 --> 19:28.533
and I appreciate
your stance on gun control.

19:28.535 --> 19:31.569
Thank you.
Jim, how are you feeling?

19:31.571 --> 19:34.872
I feel like my eyes
are prison bars

19:34.874 --> 19:37.742
and my head's
a space helmet.

19:37.910 --> 19:38.876
(CHUCKLES)
Right, Jim.

19:38.878 --> 19:42.146
<i> Now, Dr. Kamper,</i>
<i> can you explain</i>
<i> to our audience</i>

19:42.148 --> 19:44.982
what you're going
to be looking for
during this procedure?

19:44.984 --> 19:47.552
Absolutely, Mr. Blunt.
Uh, great question
as always.

19:47.554 --> 19:50.388
Uh, what I'm looking for
during the procedure
are polyps.

19:50.390 --> 19:53.958
They're usually benign,
but if, you know,
we come across any of them,

19:53.960 --> 19:55.026
we're gonna get them
out of there.

19:55.028 --> 19:56.427
So I, I guess
you could say

19:56.429 --> 19:58.829
you're going to nip
them in the butt.

19:58.831 --> 19:59.330
(LAUGHS)

19:59.332 --> 20:01.265
Certainly a lot of room
for puns in this field.

20:01.267 --> 20:04.835
And I would, uh,
also offer a bottoms up.
(CHUCKLES)

20:04.837 --> 20:06.771
JIM:
Yeah, I have a pun.

20:06.773 --> 20:08.673
I could be dying.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.274
Uh, shall we begin,
Doctor?

20:10.276 --> 20:12.343
Absolutely, Mr. Blunt.
Let's go ahead and start.

20:12.345 --> 20:13.744
Phyllis, if you'll bring
the monitor over

20:13.746 --> 20:16.747
so the patient can watch
while we do this.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.716
And let's explore
his colon.

20:18.718 --> 20:22.720
Now, right now,
the lens is at the far end
of his colon.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.957
So what I'm gonna do
is slowly withdraw it,

20:25.959 --> 20:29.627
keeping an eye out
for anything suspicious.

20:29.629 --> 20:30.795
Oh, my God.
JIM: What?

20:30.797 --> 20:34.899
It's the most beautiful
pink tunnel I've ever seen
in my life.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.934
I love it.
DR. KAMPER:
I feel the same way.

20:36.936 --> 20:39.036
You know,
people always ask me,
they say,

20:39.038 --> 20:42.406
"Dr. Rudy Kamper,
how can you be
a proctologist?"

20:42.408 --> 20:44.575
And I say to them...

20:44.910 --> 20:45.543
"Because of this."

20:45.545 --> 20:47.945
WALTER:
<i> What exactly are you</i>
<i> seeing there, Doctor?</i>

20:47.947 --> 20:50.648
Those fatty folds,
are they healthy?

20:50.650 --> 20:52.717
Uh, that's another really
great question, Mr. Blunt.

20:52.719 --> 20:54.418
Yeah, these folds
are totally healthy.

20:54.420 --> 20:57.088
Certainly a polyp
can hide on the undersides.

20:57.090 --> 20:59.991
<i> But right now everything</i>
<i> looks really great.</i>

20:59.993 --> 21:03.160
Celia, are there any
preventative measures

21:03.162 --> 21:06.597
our viewers may want
to be made aware of?

21:07.966 --> 21:08.899
Celia?

21:08.901 --> 21:11.669
Walter, sorry.
Um, yes,
there are measures.

21:11.671 --> 21:14.205
A diet high in fiber,
avoid processed foods,

21:14.207 --> 21:16.874
and if it comes
in a plastic bag,
don't eat it.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.676
I mean, give it
a wide berth.
Things...

21:18.678 --> 21:19.944
If I can just interrupt
for one second

21:19.946 --> 21:21.912
and point something out
that's fascinating.

21:21.914 --> 21:25.216
Jim, have a look
at that blue dot
right there.

21:25.218 --> 21:25.950
That's your liver.

21:25.952 --> 21:28.986
Hey, liver.
Why so blue?

21:28.988 --> 21:31.822
Now, let's move on
to the transverse colon.

21:31.824 --> 21:35.459
One fact a lot
of people don't know
about the transverse colon

21:35.461 --> 21:38.796
that it differs slightly
from the colon.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.866
People don't
know that unless...
(VOICE FADES)

21:41.868 --> 21:44.902
Hey, who are you guys?

21:45.470 --> 21:49.040
(ECHOING)
<i> Please tell me,</i>
<i> who, who are you guys?</i>

21:51.910 --> 21:54.078
We're your good
bacteria, chief.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.313
We keep things
healthy down here.

21:55.315 --> 21:57.748
What are you doing?
We're not supposed
to talk to the chief.

21:57.750 --> 22:00.518
Yeah, well, there's
never been a camera
down here before.

22:00.520 --> 22:03.754
This is our chance.
Chief, we've all
been talking

22:03.756 --> 22:05.856
and we think
Celia's the one.

22:05.858 --> 22:08.125
Hold on to her.
Don't ever let
her go.

22:08.127 --> 22:09.393
Oh, no!
Okay?

22:09.395 --> 22:11.395
Coming in!
Run! Run!

22:11.397 --> 22:12.697
Oh. Oh, no.

22:12.699 --> 22:15.066
Oh, no. No...

22:15.200 --> 22:16.400
No, no, no. No.

22:16.402 --> 22:17.435
<i> No!</i>

22:17.437 --> 22:21.172
(SPUTTERING)
Chief! Chief!

22:21.174 --> 22:22.473
Please.

22:22.475 --> 22:24.275
(SPUTTERING)

22:24.277 --> 22:26.077
JIM:
<i> No, no, no, no, no.</i>

22:26.079 --> 22:28.179
No!
Little Jims!

22:28.181 --> 22:29.747
DR. KAMPER:
Jim, Jim, Jim.
You okay?

22:29.749 --> 22:31.816
What's going on, Doctor?
Jim, are you all right?

22:31.818 --> 22:34.952
CELIA: <i> Jim, are you okay?</i>
JIM: <i> I'm more than okay,</i>
<i> Celia.</i>

22:34.954 --> 22:39.290
I just had a...
I just had a scary vision,
but I love you.

22:39.292 --> 22:42.326
Every cell in me
loves you.

22:42.328 --> 22:43.160
We're on-air, Jim.

22:43.162 --> 22:45.062
Jim, I suggest
you lie back down.

22:45.064 --> 22:48.165
Walter, I want
to propose to Celia.

22:48.167 --> 22:49.400
Do I have
your permission?

22:49.402 --> 22:52.303
Jim, uh, this isn't
the time or place.

22:52.305 --> 22:55.339
I don't care.
I'm gonna
ask her anyway.

22:55.341 --> 22:58.275
Celia,
will you marry me?

22:58.277 --> 23:00.211
I love you so much.
I really do.

23:00.213 --> 23:02.646
Not, not here.
Please?

23:02.648 --> 23:04.081
This is terrible, Jim!

23:04.083 --> 23:05.683
Okay.
Celia. Celia!

23:05.685 --> 23:08.219
I think he's on drugs
or something.
JIM: <i> Celia!</i>

23:08.221 --> 23:10.020
Jim, please.
(GROANING)

23:10.022 --> 23:11.989
Hi, Walter.
So sorry about that.

23:11.991 --> 23:15.092
We just saw a very real,
very emotional moment,

23:15.094 --> 23:18.696
which I assume are,
are common during
cancer screenings.

23:18.698 --> 23:19.597
Dr. Kamper,
is that right?

23:19.599 --> 23:22.133
Uh, sure, yeah.
Cancer can be a trigger.

23:22.135 --> 23:25.803
Jim, stop fighting us.
The camera took forever
to get inside you.

23:25.805 --> 23:27.138
I have to get to Celia.

23:27.140 --> 23:29.440
SHELLY:
<i> Wait, wait, wait!</i>
<i> Dr. Kamper.</i>

23:29.442 --> 23:30.274
Is that a polyp?

23:30.276 --> 23:34.044
Uh, yeah, definitely
looks like one.

23:34.046 --> 23:35.279
What, I...
I have a polyp?

23:35.281 --> 23:39.150
Got a good eye, Shelly.
I'm gonna have to lance that.
Lance?

23:39.152 --> 23:40.518
DR. KAMPER:
<i> This is not good.</i>

23:40.520 --> 23:42.319
Okay, Walter,
go to commercial.

23:42.321 --> 23:44.722
Shelly, we're going
to take a break now.

23:44.724 --> 23:46.257
Oh, okay, Walter.

23:46.259 --> 23:50.227
This is Shelly Tinkle
doing her thing.

23:51.496 --> 23:54.231
Of course
Cornelia was here
for this catastrophe.

23:54.233 --> 23:57.635
Where was she
when Barney Frank
and I cried together?

23:57.637 --> 23:59.336
That was beautiful, Major.

23:59.338 --> 24:01.839
Stop it, Walter.
Tonight was great.

24:01.841 --> 24:05.576
Jim was nuts,
but the Internet
is on fire.

24:05.578 --> 24:07.478
We really raised
awareness.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.380
But what about
<i> Blunt Cock?</i>

24:09.382 --> 24:12.283
I've been made to look
like a clown in Jaipur.

24:12.285 --> 24:14.652
Relax.
Don't worry.

24:14.654 --> 24:15.252
Legal is on it.

24:15.254 --> 24:18.622
And anyway, the actor
who portrayed you

24:18.624 --> 24:21.058
is very well hung.

24:21.060 --> 24:23.461
Really?
Mmm.

24:25.330 --> 24:26.664
(CHUCKLING)

24:26.666 --> 24:29.333
I gotta tell you,
I am loving your book,
Walter.

24:29.335 --> 24:30.100
It is hilarious.

24:30.102 --> 24:32.803
Herschel,
where's Cornelia?
Your lady friend?

24:32.805 --> 24:33.838
Uh, I heard her
on the phone.

24:33.840 --> 24:37.074
She's meeting somebody
at the old depot.

24:37.076 --> 24:37.641
The S&M bar?

24:37.643 --> 24:39.610
(GASPS)
Oh, I know that bar.

24:39.612 --> 24:41.412
We should totally
go there sometime.

24:41.414 --> 24:44.949
But, no, I'm talking about
the old depot
in Griffith Park.

24:44.951 --> 24:46.116
Did she say why?

24:46.118 --> 24:48.419
Something about a source.

24:48.421 --> 24:49.053
It seemed serious.

24:49.055 --> 24:51.722
We should
go there, Harry.
I'm concerned.

24:51.724 --> 24:54.124
Oh, before you go,
can I tell you
about something

24:54.126 --> 24:56.060
that happened to me
at the other Old Depot?

24:56.062 --> 24:56.994
Not now, Herschel.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.462
It's a really
good story.

24:58.464 --> 25:00.764
(LAUGHS)
There's no penetration.

25:00.766 --> 25:03.767
(SONG PLAYING)
<i> Celia,</i>

25:55.520 --> 25:59.390
Cornelia,
it's Walter... again.

25:59.591 --> 26:01.592
Please call.

26:03.361 --> 26:06.797
It's pointless, Harry.
She's not picking up.

26:06.799 --> 26:08.933
We'll find her, sir.

26:09.534 --> 26:11.135
Sir.

26:24.115 --> 26:26.417
This can't be good,
Harry.

26:30.121 --> 26:32.022
Cornelia.

26:32.857 --> 26:34.992
Cornelia?

26:46.972 --> 26:48.505
(SIGHS)

26:54.145 --> 26:55.245
Oh, no.

26:55.247 --> 26:58.449
Hey.
Hey, chief.

26:58.516 --> 27:00.884
We never said propose.

27:01.686 --> 27:02.820
(STUTTERS)
Just saying.

27:02.822 --> 27:05.022
Please, go away.

27:05.024 --> 27:07.191
Yep, okay.
Absolutely.

27:07.193 --> 27:09.827

Sorry. (CHUCKLES)
