WEBVTT

00:01.917 --> 00:03.278
Previously on {\i0} the fosters...

00:03.319 --> 00:04.620
Hey! What the hell's
going on? He's with me.
He's my foster son.

00:04.653 --> 00:05.783
We've got to start
communicating.

00:05.822 --> 00:07.352
We're communicating
right now!

00:07.389 --> 00:09.589
We're never gonna get
anywhere if we keep pointing
the finger at each other.

00:09.625 --> 00:11.426
We need to go
to therapy.

00:11.461 --> 00:12.691
I cheated on
my boyfriend...

00:12.728 --> 00:15.728
And i lost my virginity to{\i0}
a random boy i barely know.{\i0}

00:15.765 --> 00:17.405
I'm pretty sure that{\i0}
makes me a slut.{\i0}

00:17.434 --> 00:20.333
You know what?
We all do things that
we wish we hadn't.

00:20.370 --> 00:23.339
What do i say to callie?
She's gonna hate me.

00:23.373 --> 00:25.603
The next time you're looking
for adventure, you ought to
knock on my door.

00:25.641 --> 00:28.141
A.J., you're my
foster brother.
I can't.

00:29.312 --> 00:30.382
Hello?

00:30.413 --> 00:32.243
A.J., it's ty.{\i0}

00:34.149 --> 00:36.310
You were three minutes
long this morning.

00:36.353 --> 00:37.423
Can you stop
timing my showers?

00:37.454 --> 00:39.423
Sure. Can you actually
stick to schedule?

00:39.456 --> 00:41.155
Yeah, brandon,
you're first,

00:41.191 --> 00:42.451
So if you're late
the whole system
gets messed up.

00:42.491 --> 00:45.021
A couple minutes
doesn't matter.

00:45.060 --> 00:48.131
Until callie gets in there,
and then three minutes turns
to five--

00:48.164 --> 00:50.963
Okay, wait.
You're timing me now?
I'm on your side here.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.201
And then
after a.J.,
we're at six--

00:52.234 --> 00:53.335
Whoa, whoa.
Leave me out of this.

00:53.369 --> 00:55.229
so when's construction
gonna be done?

00:55.271 --> 00:59.002
Well, unfortunately, we had
to fire the contractor.
It's a long story...

00:59.042 --> 01:00.741
What are you doing
with ketchup on tacos?

01:00.777 --> 01:02.116
That's disgusting!
Ew!

01:02.145 --> 01:03.145
That's gross.

01:03.179 --> 01:04.938
So, callie, we're going
to the store tomorrow.

01:04.980 --> 01:07.081
Is there anything
in particular you
want for your birthday party?

01:07.117 --> 01:09.817
Um--
i'd hardly call it a party when
it's just us and the quinns.

01:09.852 --> 01:11.783
Well, lucky it's not your
party then, isn't it?

01:12.923 --> 01:15.552
Um, no. Whatever
is easy is fine...

01:15.591 --> 01:18.662
But i would like to,
maybe talk about my...

01:18.694 --> 01:20.495
Birthday gift
to myself.

01:20.530 --> 01:22.590
Yeah?
Uh--

01:22.632 --> 01:23.962
"your birthday gift
to yourself"?

01:24.000 --> 01:26.629
Well, interesting.
What-- what exactly
did you have in mind?

01:26.670 --> 01:28.870
So i have been saving
from my job,

01:28.905 --> 01:30.575
And i have $800.

01:30.606 --> 01:32.406
Well done.
Wow. Good job.

01:32.442 --> 01:34.671
And i would like to
buy myself a car.

01:37.514 --> 01:40.484
Oh, honey, i--
i don't know.

01:40.516 --> 01:41.757
Okay, i know
it's a big deal,

01:41.784 --> 01:45.325
But it would just
make it so much easier
to get to work,

01:45.354 --> 01:49.424
And school and i could
help you guys, too, you know
with errands and stuff...

01:49.459 --> 01:51.489
Careful what you wish for.
They will run you ragged.

01:51.527 --> 01:53.457
Ey! Hey! Take it
easy over there.

01:53.496 --> 01:55.165
Um, not that i mind.
I don't mind.

01:55.198 --> 01:58.527
I think that that's
very admirable, callie,

01:58.567 --> 02:02.067
But i don't know if that
$800 is enough to buy
something that's safe.

02:02.105 --> 02:03.275
I thought you would say that,

02:03.305 --> 02:06.075
Um, but airbags have actually
been standard since the '90s.

02:06.108 --> 02:07.108
Boy, you have done
your research.

02:07.143 --> 02:08.973
Yes,
so there are options.

02:09.012 --> 02:11.312
Uh, well, you know,
what about monthly costs?

02:11.348 --> 02:13.177
There's gas
and insurance...

02:13.216 --> 02:15.156
Well, you pay for
brandon's monthly costs...

02:15.185 --> 02:16.254
And you bought
him a car.

02:16.286 --> 02:18.186
Sounds like sexism to me.

02:18.221 --> 02:20.191
Okay,
moms didn't buy that car.
It was a hand-me-down.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.122
That got totaled,
and then they bought
you a nicer one.

02:22.158 --> 02:24.888
It wasn't my fault.
I'd like to make it clear that

02:24.927 --> 02:26.018
Insurance paid
for that car.

02:26.062 --> 02:27.991
Yes, and it belongs to
all of you, by the way.

02:28.031 --> 02:29.830
What-- it does?

02:29.865 --> 02:33.735
Yes, now that callie has
her license and the twins
will soon, too. Yes, it does.

02:34.837 --> 02:36.638
What if we had
two cars to share?

02:37.706 --> 02:38.947
honey,
i'm sorry.

02:38.974 --> 02:40.645
But for now,
the answer is no.

02:43.045 --> 02:45.545
So, have you
talked to callie yet...

02:45.581 --> 02:47.551
About the
wyatt of it all?

02:47.584 --> 02:48.783
Are you even going to?

02:48.817 --> 02:50.948
Um, i wanna--

02:50.986 --> 02:54.656
I just, i'm gonna wait
until after her birthday
party to tell her.

02:55.692 --> 02:57.622
You know, if i ruin that
on top of everything else,

02:57.661 --> 02:59.360
She'll never forgive me.

03:04.334 --> 03:06.364
Well, that's gonna suck.

03:06.402 --> 03:09.633
Do you think
she even should...
Tell her, i mean?

03:09.673 --> 03:11.242
I'm sorry, do i know you?

03:11.274 --> 03:13.274
It's just...
Mariana's really hurting.

03:14.443 --> 03:16.373
I know she would take it back
if she could, but she can't.

03:17.646 --> 03:19.417
It's not like
she's dating wyatt.

03:20.516 --> 03:22.317
It's just gonna
hurt callie.

03:24.153 --> 03:26.054
Maybe everything doesn't
have to be talked about.

03:26.088 --> 03:28.288
Well, i'm not gonna
argue with you about
that one.

03:28.324 --> 03:30.324
Does this mean
we don't have to go
to therapy tomorrow?

03:30.360 --> 03:32.020
no.

03:32.062 --> 03:33.021
just checking...

03:34.264 --> 03:35.993
Hey, bud.
Hey!

03:36.031 --> 03:38.031
So, everyone's going
to be here at 5:00...

03:38.067 --> 03:40.228
I told them to park
down the street, so
she won't see the cars...

03:40.270 --> 03:42.400
Good idea.
And callie has no idea.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:33.055 --> 04:35.055
Happy birthday!

04:35.091 --> 04:36.221
what?

04:38.161 --> 04:40.261
What is this?

04:40.295 --> 04:41.995
Wow, mariana--

04:43.098 --> 04:44.158
What is this?

04:44.199 --> 04:45.430
600 bucks.

04:45.468 --> 04:47.327
I saved it from
my {\i1} quinceanera{\i0}
and my allowance.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.329
But, i want you
to have it...

04:49.372 --> 04:51.141
So you can get a car
that moms will approve.

04:53.042 --> 04:54.312
Uh, why would you--

04:56.346 --> 04:59.146
No, mariana, i can't.

04:59.182 --> 05:01.882
What about, when you turn 16
and you want to buy a car?

05:03.019 --> 05:04.119
I'll just borrow yours.

05:04.153 --> 05:07.153
no.
I can't keep this.

05:09.291 --> 05:12.122
Okay, but what if we
bought a car together?

05:12.161 --> 05:14.132
You know, with both
of our jobs, i'm sure...

05:14.163 --> 05:16.233
Gas and insurance
will be easy.

05:16.266 --> 05:17.305
Really?

05:18.968 --> 05:20.168
Okay. I'm in.

05:21.303 --> 05:23.074
We just have to get
moms on board.

05:23.105 --> 05:24.105
Why?

05:26.276 --> 05:29.975
Sometimes it's better to ask
forgiveness than permission.

05:33.182 --> 05:35.112
So...

05:35.151 --> 05:37.321
It's really clear that
you two love each other.

05:37.353 --> 05:38.983
Oh, well,
thank god.

05:39.021 --> 05:40.351
but...

05:40.389 --> 05:42.220
What's also clear

05:42.257 --> 05:43.957
Is that your concern
for each other

05:43.992 --> 05:45.293
Is making you polite.

05:45.327 --> 05:47.057
That doesn't work.
Polite?

05:48.096 --> 05:50.096
It doesn't feel
very polite.

05:50.132 --> 05:52.132
No, no.
Probably not.

05:52.168 --> 05:54.367
Because all of your
real issues then end up
getting subverted

05:54.403 --> 05:56.903
And coming out in all
these passive-aggressive
ways.

05:58.141 --> 05:59.201
Sound familiar?

06:00.310 --> 06:01.870
So...

06:01.911 --> 06:03.880
I want you both
to make lists.

06:03.913 --> 06:05.142
Everything you love
about each other...

06:05.180 --> 06:07.050
And everything that
drives you nuts.

06:07.083 --> 06:09.052
And next week,
we'll read them.

06:09.084 --> 06:10.324
Out loud?
Mm-hmm.

06:10.353 --> 06:12.983
We're going to jump start
your communication skills.

06:13.021 --> 06:15.891
Starting with everything
that we hate about each other?

06:15.925 --> 06:17.995
I'm-- i'm--
i'm--

06:18.026 --> 06:20.336
I'm sorry, but aren't you
supposed to be helping us
stay married?

06:22.231 --> 06:23.292
Pretty sweet, right?

06:23.332 --> 06:26.062
Nelson was
my first car.

06:27.103 --> 06:28.872
It breaks my heart
to have to sell him.

06:30.273 --> 06:33.043
But i can tell you two
will take care of him
as well as i did.

06:33.076 --> 06:34.975
So he's yours,
if you want.

06:35.011 --> 06:36.040
$1,400.

06:37.213 --> 06:38.343
We'll take it...

06:38.380 --> 06:41.050
Him... For $1,150.

06:41.084 --> 06:43.084
But the ad said $1,400.

06:43.119 --> 06:44.119
I know.

06:45.153 --> 06:47.153
The car's in
perfect condition.

06:47.189 --> 06:49.120
I really can't
let him go for
any less.

06:49.158 --> 06:51.218
That's too bad.
Thank you.

06:54.230 --> 06:55.930
What are you doing?

06:55.965 --> 06:57.435
We're playing hardball.

06:57.466 --> 07:00.007
She needs to know that
we're willing to walk away
to take her seriously.

07:00.036 --> 07:01.975
No, mariana,
she named her car...

07:02.004 --> 07:03.875
Okay? This is not
someone you can
negotiate with.

07:03.906 --> 07:06.947
Okay, trust me.
She's going to ask us to
stop in like five seconds.

07:10.879 --> 07:12.209
She's leaving.

07:21.024 --> 07:22.824
Okay,
she's going to call.

07:22.858 --> 07:23.858
Two hours tops.

07:32.034 --> 07:33.634
 Hey! What's up?{\i0}

07:33.670 --> 07:35.800
Hey! What happened?

07:35.838 --> 07:36.937
I was waiting for you
like you said.

07:36.973 --> 07:38.603
I got into some trouble.{\i0}

07:38.641 --> 07:39.941
What kind of trouble?

07:39.975 --> 07:41.846
Look, just tell me{\i0}
where you are and{\i0}
i'll come get you.{\i0}

07:41.877 --> 07:42.968
Tonight, i can't.

07:43.012 --> 07:44.781
Tomorrow?{\i0}

07:44.814 --> 07:45.814
Okay. I gotta go.

07:47.582 --> 07:48.582
All right. Peace.

07:49.851 --> 07:50.781
You need some help?

07:52.555 --> 07:54.595
Uh, yeah. Could you
grab that card table?

07:56.459 --> 07:57.588
Where'd you
get the phone?

07:57.627 --> 07:58.596
Your dad.

07:58.627 --> 07:59.718
Oh, yeah?
Who were you talking to?

07:59.762 --> 08:01.291
Your dad.

08:04.300 --> 08:07.329
It's been a half hour,
mariana, okay? I'm tired
of playing hardball.

08:07.370 --> 08:08.370
That's our car.

08:08.403 --> 08:10.403
Okay, we can't cave.
Not now.

08:11.574 --> 08:12.603
But nelson...

08:14.276 --> 08:15.276
Fine!

08:19.348 --> 08:22.408
Hi! My sister and i just
test drove your car earlier...

08:22.451 --> 08:25.252
Oh! Is that right?
What?

08:25.288 --> 08:27.247
Uh-huh!

08:27.290 --> 08:28.420
Okay, great. Thanks.

08:31.259 --> 08:32.360
Nelson found a new home.

08:32.394 --> 08:34.065
Mariana!

08:35.365 --> 08:36.933
There you are!
Where've you been?

08:36.966 --> 08:38.865
The quinns are going
to be here any minute!
Come on!

08:43.139 --> 08:44.999
Paper products and platters
on the big table.

08:45.040 --> 08:46.971
We're eating buffet
style tonight...

08:47.009 --> 08:49.240
And you will come back
for condiments.

08:49.278 --> 08:52.038
Surprise!

08:59.889 --> 09:01.288
Don't look at me.

09:01.323 --> 09:03.053
Oh, we didn't tell mariana.
You know, she would've blown
the whole thing.

09:04.894 --> 09:09.594
Look, this is the first
truly happy birthday
you've had in a long time,

09:09.631 --> 09:12.731
And i-- all of us
wanted to help you
celebrate it!

09:14.570 --> 09:15.570
Did i miss a surprise?

09:23.895 --> 09:25.895
Hi!
Hey!

09:25.931 --> 09:27.161
So you had no idea?
None!

09:28.500 --> 09:30.799
Hey, where's dad? You two
are the only people
i actually invited.

09:30.836 --> 09:32.206
I don't know.
Mom dropped me off.

09:32.236 --> 09:33.777
Oh!

09:34.940 --> 09:36.840
Hey, girl!
Whoa!

09:36.875 --> 09:38.115
Get over here!

09:39.177 --> 09:41.076
Hi!
Hey!

09:41.113 --> 09:43.043
You seriously weren't
going to tell us
it was your birthday?

09:43.081 --> 09:45.081
Yeah, thank god
jude had the sense
to invite us.

09:45.116 --> 09:47.886
Of course that means
we got double the chores
to do at the house tomorrow...

09:47.919 --> 09:48.879
But yay! Happy birthday!

09:48.921 --> 09:50.051
Wow!

09:50.087 --> 09:52.847
Hey! Happy birthday!

09:53.892 --> 09:55.961
And i,
sincerely mean it.

09:55.994 --> 09:57.823
Look at you...

09:57.863 --> 09:59.562
Really nice turn out.

09:59.597 --> 10:01.597
Thanks.
A lot of people
love you, callie.

10:06.705 --> 10:07.835
Well, that's awkward.

10:07.873 --> 10:10.673
I guess, maybe we should've
checked jude's guest list.

10:10.708 --> 10:13.369
I got half the mind
to smack that kid.

10:13.412 --> 10:15.542
Mariana said she was
the one who instigated it,

10:15.581 --> 10:17.681
So, no need
for violence.

10:17.716 --> 10:19.686
Well, there's something you
can add to your hate list.

10:19.717 --> 10:21.447
Honey, it's not
a hate list--

10:21.485 --> 10:23.655
The delivery guys were supposed
to be here 30 minutes ago.

10:24.655 --> 10:27.296
Ah, well, i'm sure
they're just running
behind, honey.

10:27.326 --> 10:28.495
Yeah.
We'll give them a call though.

10:28.527 --> 10:29.626
Yeah. We can do that.

10:33.599 --> 10:35.298
Do you think
callie's having fun?

10:36.368 --> 10:38.528
I think that you are
the bestest brother ever.

10:41.572 --> 10:44.243
Hey, did you talk
to a.J. This morning?

10:45.509 --> 10:46.509
What do you mean?

10:46.544 --> 10:48.184
Like on the phone?

10:48.212 --> 10:52.153
I kinda overheard him
on a call.
He was acting weird.

10:52.183 --> 10:53.283
He said he was
talking to you.

10:53.317 --> 10:55.177
I'm sure he was.

10:55.220 --> 10:57.049
It's like, what time?

10:57.088 --> 10:58.288
What's eating you, b?

10:58.322 --> 11:00.253
Well, i just-- i...

11:00.292 --> 11:02.261
I think he was
talking to his brother.

11:02.293 --> 11:04.124
Why? Did he say
something specific?

11:04.162 --> 11:06.831
Uh, no. He's just being
all secretive or whatever.

11:06.865 --> 11:08.034
I'm not concerned.

11:11.903 --> 11:12.932
Hey! Can you
grab me a lighter?

11:22.780 --> 11:23.780
Hey there.

11:26.784 --> 11:28.884
I'm sorry if me
being here is weird,

11:28.919 --> 11:30.850
Since you're
avoiding me and all.

11:30.889 --> 11:33.088
I'm not avoiding you.

11:33.125 --> 11:34.865
It's just complicated.

11:34.893 --> 11:36.962
'cause of callie,
i get that.

11:36.995 --> 11:40.894
And she doesn't know
about anything, so--

11:40.932 --> 11:42.631
Don't worry.

11:43.735 --> 11:45.634
Also, i had a boyfriend.

11:47.806 --> 11:50.775
Like, when we--
exactly.

11:50.808 --> 11:53.538
I'm sorry i didn't--
it's not your fault.

11:54.712 --> 11:55.842
It's okay.

11:57.581 --> 11:58.711
So you had a boyfriend?

12:00.585 --> 12:01.554
Or you have?

12:01.586 --> 12:03.586
(girls scatting
and beat-boxing)

12:05.791 --> 12:08.591
Yo, callie,
check this out.

12:17.635 --> 12:20.306
Whoa!

12:22.441 --> 12:24.400
That's true.

12:34.619 --> 12:36.448
Yo! Drop it
like it's hot, ladies.

12:38.490 --> 12:40.120
Hey! Hey!
Hi.

12:40.158 --> 12:41.187
Surprised to see me?

12:41.225 --> 12:42.426
Yeah.

12:42.461 --> 12:46.061
Um, listen, my mums don't
know that i got fired.

12:46.097 --> 12:48.498
I know. I kind of assumed
as much when i got invited.

12:48.533 --> 12:50.102
We miss you
at the center.

12:51.168 --> 12:52.399
yeah.
I miss you guys, too.

12:54.038 --> 12:56.198
Hey, so what's
he doing here?

12:57.375 --> 12:58.945
Uh, he kinda
lives here now.

13:01.113 --> 13:02.212
Really?

13:02.246 --> 13:04.246
Wow! Well,
that's unexpected.

13:04.282 --> 13:06.052
Trust me, yeah.
Callie...

13:06.083 --> 13:07.283
Hey, dad!

13:07.318 --> 13:09.149
Happy birthday.
Sorry i'm late.
Thank you.

13:09.187 --> 13:11.027
No!
I guess i missed
the big moment, huh?

13:11.056 --> 13:13.125
Don't worry about it.
Did you see soph?

13:13.158 --> 13:15.118
Uh...
Why did you guys
not come together?

13:15.159 --> 13:17.889
I had a work thing.

13:17.928 --> 13:19.158
Callie,
sorry to interrupt...

13:19.197 --> 13:21.136
Becka has another
present for you.

13:21.166 --> 13:23.206
go.

13:32.878 --> 13:34.008
The party's out
there, you know?

13:36.148 --> 13:37.807
I'm just
taking a break.

13:39.918 --> 13:42.677
So, what do you think of
your new foster brother?

13:43.922 --> 13:45.892
Not much. Why?

13:48.960 --> 13:50.759
He's cute.

13:50.796 --> 13:51.936
Objectively,
he's cute.

13:51.962 --> 13:53.863
I didn't make
the rules.

13:53.899 --> 13:56.698
So what? You don't
like him? Why not?

13:56.735 --> 13:59.504
Well, for one,
he stole something from me.

13:59.538 --> 14:01.597
Something worth
a lot of money.

14:01.639 --> 14:03.600
Do your moms know?

14:03.642 --> 14:05.511
Um... No.

14:05.543 --> 14:06.573
He gave it back.

14:06.610 --> 14:08.711
But i still think
he's full of crap.

14:08.746 --> 14:09.817
So why not tell them?

14:11.482 --> 14:12.613
I should've, but i--

14:12.650 --> 14:16.350
I can't now.
I had to sell it...

14:16.388 --> 14:17.748
To replace something
i lost.

14:19.356 --> 14:21.397
Specific much?
uh--

14:21.426 --> 14:25.336
And my moms can't
find out about it.

14:26.463 --> 14:27.463
So there's nothing
i can do.

14:30.302 --> 14:31.432
Well, there's got
to be something.

14:34.306 --> 14:36.505
Okay, so this is your
immediate future. Okay?

14:38.509 --> 14:39.539
Two of cups?

14:39.577 --> 14:41.207
You're going
to have coffee.

14:41.245 --> 14:43.385
Great.
It actually means romance.

14:43.414 --> 14:44.485
That's unlikely.

14:46.217 --> 14:47.447
Well, it could
also mean friendship.

14:47.485 --> 14:49.325
Well, now you're
just guessing.

14:49.354 --> 14:52.153
I mean, so this card
is the final outcome.
Okay.

14:57.428 --> 14:59.259
What does it mean?

14:59.297 --> 15:00.397
Um--

15:02.033 --> 15:05.033
Chaos, upheaval
and downfall.

15:07.172 --> 15:08.172
Happy birthday.

15:13.828 --> 15:15.528
Uh, no.

15:15.565 --> 15:18.504
not that bulge. Gross.

15:18.533 --> 15:20.234
Right front pocket.

15:20.269 --> 15:23.328
His phone. Should have all the
proof that you need to show
your dad that he's lying, right?

15:24.440 --> 15:25.470
So?

15:25.508 --> 15:26.538
So, you need to get it.

15:28.476 --> 15:30.317
Right, yeah.
I'll just go up to him
and be like,

15:30.346 --> 15:32.645
"hey, a.J., can i borrow
your phone? I'd like to
check the call history."

15:35.350 --> 15:36.480
It's a fair point.

15:40.288 --> 15:41.649
Hey!

15:41.691 --> 15:45.221
Everything all right with you
and certain surprise guest?

15:46.328 --> 15:47.558
You can say his name.

15:47.596 --> 15:51.236
And he actually
asked me out.

15:51.267 --> 15:53.336
Really? And?

15:55.136 --> 15:57.206
I don't know.
I mean...

15:57.239 --> 15:59.198
He's nice
and cute and--

16:00.308 --> 16:01.438
He doesn't think
callie would care.

16:01.476 --> 16:04.187
Said i should
just ask her.

16:04.212 --> 16:06.082
And what do
you think?

16:06.115 --> 16:09.085
Well, let's say
i do ask her...

16:09.118 --> 16:13.077
And let's say she's
cool with wyatt and i
getting together, and--

16:13.121 --> 16:16.221
Then maybe you don't
have to tell callie that
you already got together.

16:16.258 --> 16:19.057
Well, if it doesn't
bother callie now,

16:19.095 --> 16:21.034
Then that means it wouldn't
bother her then, right?

16:23.198 --> 16:25.028
You're gonna make
a really great
lawyer someday.

16:26.201 --> 16:29.032
Is that really how
you want to handle this?

16:29.071 --> 16:30.941
Hey, guys.
Hey, honey.

16:35.244 --> 16:38.183
Okay, so you remember
the '98 sedan we were
looking at?

16:38.213 --> 16:40.144
The guy just texted me back
and he's bringing it over.

16:40.182 --> 16:42.812
When?
In an hour.

16:42.851 --> 16:45.721
Well, you can't just
test drive a car in the
middle of your party.

16:45.754 --> 16:48.024
No one's gonna notice
if we're gone a few minutes.

16:48.057 --> 16:50.027
Whose birthday
is it anyway? Come on.

17:09.912 --> 17:11.612
Hey!
Hey!

17:11.646 --> 17:12.886
How are you?
I'm good. How are you?

17:12.914 --> 17:14.515
How's everything
at the center?

17:14.549 --> 17:15.710
Good, yeah.
Real good.

17:15.750 --> 17:17.451
How's callie doing?

17:17.486 --> 17:19.586
Good. Yeah.
She's doing good.

17:19.622 --> 17:21.491
Let me ask you
something...

17:21.522 --> 17:23.894
Where was callie
when i dropped off
carmen last week?

17:27.829 --> 17:29.490
I had to let callie go.

17:29.531 --> 17:30.701
Hmm...

17:30.732 --> 17:33.363
I thought she was
doing really well.

17:33.402 --> 17:34.602
Yeah. She was.

17:34.636 --> 17:35.737
She was doing great.

17:35.770 --> 17:36.730
So what happened?

17:41.309 --> 17:42.710
He did.
And who is he?

17:44.547 --> 17:45.646
Her new foster brother.

17:47.615 --> 17:48.586
Oh!

17:49.719 --> 17:52.148
Here you go.
Thanks.

17:53.521 --> 17:55.291
If, uh--

17:55.324 --> 17:58.423
If ty calls... When he calls,
you'd let me know, right?

17:59.595 --> 18:00.565
Right.

18:00.596 --> 18:02.066
Okay.

18:12.407 --> 18:15.137
Another round of burgers
are up if you're hungry.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.414
Uh, no, thanks.
I think i'll save
room for cake.

18:18.446 --> 18:23.186
I wanted to tell you
how sorry lena...

18:23.219 --> 18:25.919
And i were to hear
about you and jill.

18:25.954 --> 18:28.055
Were you? Sorry?

18:28.089 --> 18:30.250
I never had any intention
of telling jill.

18:36.298 --> 18:38.157
Stef, you were
blackmailing me.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.829
It was a risk
i couldn't take.

18:41.069 --> 18:43.069
Well, i am still sorry to
hear about the separation.

18:45.207 --> 18:46.947
But you were the one who
chose to have an affair.

18:53.015 --> 18:54.045
How 'bout this?

18:54.083 --> 18:55.712
We put on a slow song...

18:55.750 --> 18:57.111
I'll ask a.J. To dance...

18:57.153 --> 18:58.952
I'll snuggle up
to him, and you know...

18:58.988 --> 19:00.018
Grab his phone
out of his pocket.

19:01.056 --> 19:03.695
Um, no, you're 15.

19:03.726 --> 19:05.796
I'm not pimping you out
just to prove my dad wrong.

19:05.827 --> 19:07.018
Fine. You want to
dance with him?

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
Or... We could just
unplug his phone from
the charger and take it.

19:23.494 --> 19:25.335
It's got
everything we need.

19:25.364 --> 19:27.294
Yeah, including a big
dent in the bumper.

19:28.767 --> 19:31.007
Which gives a character.
it's time
that we negotiate.

19:32.037 --> 19:33.336
So? What do you think?

19:33.372 --> 19:35.971
It's yours for $1,350.
We'll take it.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.337
What happened
to negotiating?

19:37.375 --> 19:39.976
Um, we just have
to get some money
out from the bank...

19:40.011 --> 19:42.342
Uh, do you think you can
hold it until tomorrow?
That works.

19:42.381 --> 19:44.381
Call me in the morning.
Perfect.

19:44.415 --> 19:45.986
Will do.

19:51.990 --> 19:53.089
We just bought a car.

19:53.125 --> 19:54.325
I know!

19:56.260 --> 19:57.891
Where's that from?

19:57.929 --> 20:00.128
It's from a box of
old photos my dad
just gave me.

20:00.164 --> 20:02.865
Oh! It's great to have those.

20:03.934 --> 20:06.075
I can't get over
the bowl cut.
I mean, honestly...

20:06.104 --> 20:08.844
And look at how happy
she is smiling there.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.773
When she was a kid,
callie was obsessed
with her birthdays.

20:11.809 --> 20:14.940
And, apparently,
the little mermaid as well.

20:14.980 --> 20:16.880
It was never
just one day.

20:16.914 --> 20:18.884
She always made it
like her birth-week.

20:18.916 --> 20:20.916
And one time
she even made it
her birth-month.

20:20.951 --> 20:25.021
Well... You threw
a very nice party.

20:25.057 --> 20:25.997
Good job.

20:27.025 --> 20:28.765
I saw you
talking to robert.

20:28.794 --> 20:31.763
Yeah. Apparently
it's my fault that he and
jill separated because...

20:31.797 --> 20:33.967
I threatened to tell
her about the affair.

20:33.999 --> 20:35.858
Don't look at me like that.
Like what?

20:35.901 --> 20:38.631
I know that you think
what i did was wrong.

20:38.670 --> 20:39.930
You can add that
to your hate list.

20:39.971 --> 20:42.601
Honey, i really wish
you would stop calling
it a hate list.

20:42.641 --> 20:45.540
That's what it feels like.
I'm pretty sure that it defeats
the purpose of the exercise.

20:45.576 --> 20:47.616
What? I'm sorry--
hey, we need more buns.

20:47.645 --> 20:49.645
Here it is.
You know what, mike,
take a break.

20:50.648 --> 20:51.648
I got it.

20:55.386 --> 20:56.527
Did i walk in
on something?

20:56.555 --> 21:00.355
no, it's fine.
We're going to couples
counseling.

21:00.392 --> 21:02.592
Really?
Mm-hmm.

21:02.626 --> 21:03.666
Everything all right?

21:05.364 --> 21:06.493
Yeah, it's fine.

21:06.530 --> 21:08.401
It's just the therapist
has us making lists

21:08.432 --> 21:12.732
Of everything that we love
and h-- don't like
about each other.

21:14.271 --> 21:15.402
That sounds like
a bad idea.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.299
You've agreed to this?

21:17.342 --> 21:18.342
What could i say?

21:18.376 --> 21:20.247
That's what married
couples do, right?

21:20.278 --> 21:21.438
I know.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.380
I should've agreed to go
to counseling with you.

21:23.414 --> 21:25.184
I got it.

21:25.217 --> 21:27.156
Well,
in hindsight though,

21:27.184 --> 21:29.484
No amount of therapy
was going to turn you
into a woman.

21:29.520 --> 21:32.221
Wait, wait. If i
was a woman, you think
we'd still be together?

21:32.257 --> 21:35.297
oh, god, no.
That's funny.

21:35.326 --> 21:36.527
You didn't have to
answer that fast.

21:38.497 --> 21:40.467
Is it weird
having wyatt here?

21:40.499 --> 21:42.128
No. No,
we're cool now.

21:43.167 --> 21:45.097
That's nice.
Hmm.

21:45.136 --> 21:46.406
So, question for you...

21:46.438 --> 21:48.097
Okay?

21:48.140 --> 21:49.970
It just occurred to me,
today...

21:50.008 --> 21:50.998
Yeah?

21:51.041 --> 21:54.372
You know, since wyatt's
single and cute...

21:54.413 --> 21:57.083
And now i'm single
and cute...

21:57.115 --> 22:01.015
You wouldn't care if i
ever went out with him,
would you?

22:01.051 --> 22:02.981
I mean, only if
you don't mind.

22:04.890 --> 22:07.019
You just broke up
with mat.

22:07.057 --> 22:10.288
I know, but i was
thinking that maybe,
if i started dating again,

22:10.327 --> 22:11.958
It'll help me
get over him.

22:15.032 --> 22:18.063
Um-- wyatt and i
are just friends now.

22:18.103 --> 22:19.772
Are you sure?
Yeah.

22:34.685 --> 22:36.786
No record of any incoming
or outgoing calls...

22:36.822 --> 22:38.991
No texts... Wow.

22:40.991 --> 22:43.791
He's erased everything.
He's covering his tracks.

22:43.828 --> 22:45.689
Well, maybe there's a way
to find out what he deleted.

22:48.567 --> 22:49.866
Okay, now,
charlie's angels. Come on.

22:52.903 --> 22:54.903
Hey! Got a sec?

22:54.940 --> 22:56.500
Uh, sure.

23:00.811 --> 23:03.541
So, um...
I talked to callie...

23:03.582 --> 23:04.811
And?

23:04.849 --> 23:07.410
And you were right...

23:07.451 --> 23:08.481
She's totally cool with us.

23:09.788 --> 23:11.788
So...
So...

23:11.823 --> 23:13.692
You want to go
out with me?

23:15.359 --> 23:17.289
I mean, if you're into the
whole french cowboy thing...

23:18.696 --> 23:19.666
Of, course, i do.

23:19.698 --> 23:21.327
Oui...{\i0}

23:21.365 --> 23:22.506
Oui.{\i0}

23:25.269 --> 23:26.400
Having fun?
Yeah.

23:27.672 --> 23:28.672
You don't sound
so sure about that.

23:30.241 --> 23:31.271
Um--

23:32.410 --> 23:34.509
I think mariana wants
to go out with wyatt.

23:34.546 --> 23:36.445
Why do you say that?

23:36.480 --> 23:38.211
'cause she asked me
if it was okay.

23:40.184 --> 23:41.555
Oh! What did--
what did you say?

23:41.586 --> 23:43.256
That it's fine.

23:44.455 --> 23:45.526
Is it?

23:48.226 --> 23:49.496
I mean,
it's kinda weird.

23:49.528 --> 23:51.387
My sister and
my ex-boyfriend.

23:56.468 --> 23:58.298
Hey! Where's my phone?

23:59.336 --> 24:01.277
I haven't seen it.
Are you sure about that?

24:04.108 --> 24:05.568
Give it to me. Now!
Who is this? Huh?

24:05.609 --> 24:08.009
Who's calling?
How the hell am i supposed
to know, you got my phone?

24:08.046 --> 24:09.246
Hello!
I said give it to me.

24:09.280 --> 24:10.340
Who is this,
your brother?

24:10.382 --> 24:12.051
Hey! Come on!
Oh, my gosh!

24:12.083 --> 24:13.282
A.J.!
Hey!

24:19.190 --> 24:20.220
Brandon! Brandon!

24:20.258 --> 24:21.988
What's going on?
He tried to steal my phone.

24:22.027 --> 24:23.227
He freaked out 'cause
i answered the phone.

24:23.260 --> 24:25.830
What are you doing
answering his phone,
brandon?

24:25.864 --> 24:27.193
It's like i told you.
He's talking to his brother...

24:27.231 --> 24:30.001
Or someone else
that he doesn't want
you to know about.

24:30.035 --> 24:31.035
Give me the phone!

24:36.207 --> 24:37.146
Okay, everyone...

24:37.174 --> 24:38.714
Hi, did you just call?

24:40.077 --> 24:41.907
Yeah, don't call
this number again, okay?

24:45.683 --> 24:47.713
Just some kid who
saw the number on
the water tower.

24:49.587 --> 24:50.617
What are you doing?

24:52.557 --> 24:54.656
I... I...
I was worried--
worried about what?

24:55.926 --> 24:57.697
There's nothing to
worry about, okay?

24:57.729 --> 24:58.828
Stay the hell out
of it, brandon!

25:17.307 --> 25:18.376
Hey...

25:21.310 --> 25:23.111
You okay?
What was that about?

25:25.214 --> 25:26.914
That guy doesn't
want me here, okay?

25:28.050 --> 25:29.080
He don't like me.

25:34.156 --> 25:35.297
I'm really sorry
he did that.

25:46.903 --> 25:47.972
Hey.

25:53.742 --> 25:56.643
You know, word of advice,
now that you've got two kids...

25:56.679 --> 25:57.739
You can't play favorites.

25:58.881 --> 26:00.851
I know you're trying
to show a.J. That you
trust him...

26:00.883 --> 26:03.952
But you can't do that
at brandon's expense.

26:12.729 --> 26:13.828
Uh, hi. Can i talk
to you for a sec?

26:14.931 --> 26:16.461
Sure.

26:18.800 --> 26:20.730
Hey! You got another
party you're going to?

26:20.769 --> 26:22.900
No, i, uh--

26:22.939 --> 26:25.469
I'm just letting my mom
know when to pick me up.

26:25.508 --> 26:27.538
Oh, your dad can't take
you home? Where is he?

26:27.576 --> 26:28.646
I don't want him to.

26:30.546 --> 26:31.586
Okay.

26:33.449 --> 26:34.409
Why not?

26:34.450 --> 26:36.380
Did you know that, um--

26:37.753 --> 26:39.784
That he cheated
on my mom?

26:46.496 --> 26:49.296
You know,
i totally remember...

26:49.332 --> 26:52.332
The first time i realized
that my dad was human.

26:52.367 --> 26:54.367
And man, it was hard...

26:55.438 --> 26:58.198
Seeing him actually
make mistakes.

26:58.240 --> 26:59.540
It's just so
humiliating.

27:02.144 --> 27:06.315
No one... No one thinks that
this has anything to do
with you, i promise you.

27:10.353 --> 27:11.452
And, uh...

27:15.191 --> 27:18.090
It doesn't mean that your
dad loves you any less.

27:18.126 --> 27:20.067
I know that
for a fact.

27:24.334 --> 27:26.134
I hope you'll stay
around for cake...

27:26.169 --> 27:27.169
Yeah?

27:38.314 --> 27:39.943
We need to break up.

27:41.917 --> 27:42.978
Uh...

27:43.019 --> 27:44.179
I'm kidding.

27:44.220 --> 27:46.849
But, i don't think
we should do this.

27:46.888 --> 27:47.848
Why?

27:47.890 --> 27:50.960
Because callie said that
she was okay with it...

27:50.992 --> 27:52.923
But she's not.

27:58.734 --> 28:00.674
Hey!

28:00.702 --> 28:01.803
I hear a.J.
Got you fired.

28:03.638 --> 28:06.798
Don't worry,
i'm not gonna narc on you.
That's up to you to do.

28:07.977 --> 28:10.646
I'm gonna... I just
wanted to have...
Yeah.

28:10.680 --> 28:11.640
You'll find
the right time.

28:13.849 --> 28:15.950
Callie... Why is
he in your house?

28:15.984 --> 28:17.654
I was trying
to help him.

28:19.622 --> 28:20.821
You know...

28:20.856 --> 28:23.626
You are so good
at taking care
of other people.

28:25.528 --> 28:26.557
Just once...

28:27.630 --> 28:29.430
I'd like to see you
take care of yourself.

28:37.807 --> 28:39.576
I really don't want to
talk to you right now.

28:42.644 --> 28:43.644
All right.

28:46.281 --> 28:48.481
okay,
but look--

28:48.518 --> 28:50.248
Something happened
the other day,

28:50.286 --> 28:52.486
When a.J. Was with me
in the squad car...

28:52.521 --> 28:54.451
And i guess i'm just...

28:54.490 --> 28:56.349
Sensitive to people
accusing him--

28:56.392 --> 28:57.561
Okay, but what about me?

28:59.194 --> 29:00.164
Huh?

29:01.364 --> 29:03.534
You seem pretty fine
of accusing me of
just about anything.

29:03.566 --> 29:05.435
I'm sorry, i didn't mean
to accuse you--

29:05.468 --> 29:07.498
Save it for the son
you wish you had.

29:10.138 --> 29:12.239
You guys can talk about
it at like a padres game
or whatever.

29:14.309 --> 29:16.269
You know,
you've been here

29:16.311 --> 29:18.241
To see him more
in the last few weeks

29:18.280 --> 29:20.480
Than you've ever come
to see me in the last
few years.

29:25.354 --> 29:28.023
I was... Just...

29:31.160 --> 29:32.359
Looking out for you.
It won't happen again.

29:32.394 --> 29:34.194
Look, brandon,
i'm sorry.

29:36.031 --> 29:37.362
I screwed up.

29:37.400 --> 29:40.000
I'm new to this.
I don't know how
to parent you kids.

29:41.002 --> 29:43.002
It's a big change, i know.

29:46.308 --> 29:48.068
I need you to understand,

29:48.109 --> 29:50.109
I'm never gonna choose
anyone over you.

29:51.247 --> 29:52.317
Okay?

30:00.923 --> 30:02.353
You know,
the entire time
that we went out,

30:02.391 --> 30:04.060
All you did was
yank me around.

30:04.093 --> 30:05.323
I was understanding...

30:05.361 --> 30:08.191
I was patient. I did
everything that you ever
asked me to do...

30:08.230 --> 30:09.290
Just for you
to dump me.

30:09.332 --> 30:11.231
Now you're not gonna let
mariana date me either?

30:11.267 --> 30:12.866
I already told mariana,

30:12.902 --> 30:15.201
If you two want to date,
i don't have any rights
to stand in your way. Okay?

30:15.238 --> 30:17.097
You're right. You don't!
No.

30:17.138 --> 30:18.939
'cause we didn't
do anything wrong.

30:18.974 --> 30:21.045
What?
And honestly,
i'm really tired of

30:21.076 --> 30:23.886
All this stressing,
about whether you're gonna
get upset about something.

30:23.913 --> 30:25.883
What do you mean,
do anything wrong, wyatt?
What? When?

30:25.914 --> 30:27.984
She's been so scared...

30:28.017 --> 30:31.057
That you would find out
and get all upset.

30:31.086 --> 30:32.926
Like you said,
you don't have
any right to be,

30:32.954 --> 30:34.795
So i don't even know
why we're keeping this
a secret.

30:34.824 --> 30:36.193
Keeping what a secret?

30:36.224 --> 30:38.894
That mariana and i
hooked up...

30:38.927 --> 30:40.117
At the
end-of-school party.

30:44.133 --> 30:45.163
What do you mean
you hooked up?

30:49.971 --> 30:50.971
Callie!

30:53.875 --> 30:55.145
Hey! You good?
Come on.

31:09.241 --> 31:10.442
Stop eating all of it.

31:12.244 --> 31:14.144
You had sex with wyatt?

31:14.180 --> 31:16.240
I-- can we go somewhere?

31:16.281 --> 31:18.112
What? You don't
want people to hear?

31:18.151 --> 31:19.310
No, i just--

31:19.352 --> 31:20.352
I just want to explain.

31:20.386 --> 31:22.287
There's nothing to
explain, mariana.

31:22.321 --> 31:25.051
Look, i am so sorry.

31:26.291 --> 31:28.321
If you were fine
with me and wyatt dating

31:28.361 --> 31:31.290
Then... Is the sex thing
really that big a deal?

31:31.330 --> 31:34.161
I mean, it was a mistake,
and it only happened once.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.130
And what about lying to me?
Is that a one time thing, too?

31:37.302 --> 31:39.002
I told you i lost
my virginity...

31:39.038 --> 31:40.439
You assumed that
it was mat, so--

31:40.472 --> 31:42.103
What?
Did i really lie?

31:42.142 --> 31:44.072
This isn't a
negotiation, mariana.

31:45.944 --> 31:47.914
Okay, if you
wanna date wyatt...

31:47.947 --> 31:49.346
It doesn't really
matter to me, okay?

31:49.382 --> 31:51.352
But don't pretend
like you care what
i think.

31:51.384 --> 31:54.153
No... Look, i don't
want to date wyatt.

31:54.186 --> 31:55.656
I just thought--

31:55.688 --> 31:57.988
That in this case
my permission would be easier
to get than my forgiveness?

31:58.023 --> 32:00.263
No! I just thought that--

32:00.292 --> 32:02.893
If he was my boyfriend...

32:02.929 --> 32:04.189
I wouldn't be
that girl that

32:04.230 --> 32:07.099
Lost it to, you know,
some random guy
she barely knows.

32:09.001 --> 32:11.132
I'd be the girl that
lost her virginity
to her boyfriend.

32:12.872 --> 32:14.872
Someone i can maybe...

32:14.907 --> 32:15.897
Eventually love...

32:17.911 --> 32:19.010
The way i love mat.

32:21.280 --> 32:22.911
I was gonna tell you.

32:23.982 --> 32:25.212
I swear.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

32:25.250 --> 32:27.820
I was... Just not today.

32:27.854 --> 32:28.884
I didn't want to
ruin your party.

32:28.922 --> 32:31.021
Oh, the big surprise
party i didn't want?

32:31.057 --> 32:32.957
It's a little late
for that, mariana.

32:34.227 --> 32:36.027
Hey! Just the girl
i'm looking for.

32:36.061 --> 32:38.092
Can i borrow you
for a second?

32:38.131 --> 32:39.131
Yeah, sure.

32:39.164 --> 32:40.734
Okay. Come on.

32:47.973 --> 32:48.973
Hey!

32:53.813 --> 32:55.042
here.

32:58.084 --> 33:00.054
Brandon was right.

33:00.086 --> 33:01.655
I've been talking to ty.

33:06.826 --> 33:07.965
Okay?

33:10.896 --> 33:12.696
Look...

33:12.731 --> 33:14.632
If you want to run...

33:14.666 --> 33:15.967
And i really hope you don't...

33:16.001 --> 33:17.872
But if you do,
there's nothing
i can do about it.

33:20.973 --> 33:22.844
I'm glad you're back
in touch with ty.

33:24.943 --> 33:27.584
All i ask is that
you keep me in the loop.

33:33.752 --> 33:34.722
What's going on?

33:34.753 --> 33:36.523
Wait. Give me one sec.

33:42.729 --> 33:43.689
Happy birthday.

33:45.765 --> 33:48.765
Sorry about the bow...
I don't know where they
get those giant ones.

33:50.802 --> 33:51.802
You got me a car?

33:51.837 --> 33:53.567
Yeah! You like it?

33:54.907 --> 33:55.867
I do!

33:57.477 --> 33:59.846
I will handle the insurance,
don't worry, but the gas is
all you.

33:59.878 --> 34:01.578
I wasn't sure
if you like red.

34:01.614 --> 34:04.614
I think cops pull over
the color red more
than any other,

34:04.651 --> 34:06.611
But hey, that might
be a good thing.

34:06.653 --> 34:08.552
Keep you from speeding.

34:10.489 --> 34:12.489
Uh, i can't take it.

34:14.693 --> 34:15.793
Why not?

34:15.827 --> 34:18.728
I don't think it's fair on
the other kids in the family,

34:18.764 --> 34:21.804
And i kinda made a deal
with mariana, we're gonna
get a car together.

34:21.833 --> 34:23.534
I don't really wanna
go back on that.

34:23.570 --> 34:27.500
Wow! You might be
the only teenager

34:27.539 --> 34:29.739
That turned down
a car, like...

34:29.775 --> 34:32.675
Sorry.
...Ever.

34:32.710 --> 34:34.512
It's so sweet, though.

34:36.782 --> 34:38.313
You're a good kid.

34:39.552 --> 34:40.722
So will you be
able to take it back?

34:42.322 --> 34:43.481
Probably not.

34:43.523 --> 34:45.592
But sophia's gonna be
driving soon, so...

34:55.235 --> 34:56.235
I, uh--

34:57.469 --> 34:59.130
I told her...

34:59.172 --> 35:00.541
About the affair.

35:00.572 --> 35:02.202
She was really lashing
out at her mom

35:02.242 --> 35:03.572
About the whole
separation and i just...

35:06.512 --> 35:08.581
Felt like i owed her
the truth, you know?

35:08.614 --> 35:10.284
Of course, now she's
not talking to me.

35:17.289 --> 35:20.119
You know, the best
gift you ever gave me...

35:21.527 --> 35:24.536
Is even when i was
so mad at you...

35:24.563 --> 35:27.434
And even when i told
you to leave me alone...

35:28.534 --> 35:30.063
You never did.

36:01.934 --> 36:03.364
Where are you going?
Connor's.

36:03.402 --> 36:05.003
Oh, you're leaving
my party?

36:05.038 --> 36:07.297
The party you
never wanted?
Yeah, i am.

36:09.175 --> 36:10.914
Jude, i didn't mean it.

36:10.943 --> 36:13.143
No, i love that you
did all this, really...

36:15.213 --> 36:17.213
It's just, all these people
paying attention to me...

36:18.284 --> 36:19.313
It's a lot.

36:22.288 --> 36:24.217
You used to love
your birthdays.

36:25.858 --> 36:26.887
Yeah.

36:28.061 --> 36:29.990
I guess i don't really
remember that girl anymore.

36:32.864 --> 36:35.005
Well, i guess,
i have to remember
her for you.

36:41.873 --> 36:44.813
Okay. I have one more
surprise for you.

36:44.844 --> 36:46.114
Though, you might hate it.

36:48.181 --> 36:51.050
I remember it wasn't
a birthday party unless mom
and dad got you one of these.

36:54.119 --> 36:55.119
Sorry...

36:56.121 --> 36:57.692
You're kidding?

36:58.824 --> 37:00.125
come on!

37:04.063 --> 37:07.103
Guys, come on!
This bouncy castle's
way too big for two people.

37:17.976 --> 37:20.686
Rita, come on.
Guys, rita!

37:20.713 --> 37:21.782
Come on! Yes!
No.

37:21.813 --> 37:23.753
Rita, yes! Get in here!
No...

37:23.782 --> 37:24.882
All right.

37:24.916 --> 37:25.987
Look out, i'm coming in.

37:26.018 --> 37:27.878
rita!

37:30.789 --> 37:32.719
Get back! Everybody!

37:32.759 --> 37:34.018
Keep your distance!

37:48.807 --> 37:50.768
Here's that piece of cake that
you've been holding out for.

37:50.809 --> 37:51.840
Thanks.

37:55.815 --> 37:56.885
Um--

37:58.851 --> 38:00.820
You know,
everything that i did...

38:00.853 --> 38:02.682
During the custody battle...

38:02.722 --> 38:04.822
I keep telling myself
it was all justified--

38:04.856 --> 38:06.896
Look, stef, i don't
blame the problems in
my marriage on you--

38:06.925 --> 38:09.795
No, no, no.
That's not what
i'm saying. I--

38:09.829 --> 38:11.728
You've been really
good to callie...

38:11.764 --> 38:14.934
And you've proven yourself
to be an honorable man and
what i did, it was not...

38:14.967 --> 38:16.467
Honorable.

38:21.606 --> 38:22.706
Hey, how'd she
like the car?

38:28.748 --> 38:30.507
Callie knows.
You told her?

38:31.550 --> 38:32.851
I don't think she'll ever
stop being mad at me.

38:34.987 --> 38:36.856
Well, she doesn't look
too mad right now.

38:38.724 --> 38:40.824
Go! Bounce with your sister.

38:51.670 --> 38:54.740
You'll be happy to know
that i apologized to robert.

38:54.773 --> 38:57.643
Nice. Add that
to my love list.

38:57.677 --> 38:59.847
Oh, good. At least
you'll have something
on that list.

38:59.878 --> 39:02.878
Honey...
Almost everything i write
ends up on the love list.

39:04.684 --> 39:06.583
It does. I--

39:06.619 --> 39:09.918
Whenever i think of
something that drives
me crazy about you...

39:09.956 --> 39:11.856
I immediately want to
come to your defense...

39:12.891 --> 39:14.722
Because i know why
you're quick to react...

39:14.760 --> 39:16.690
Because you're protecting
our family,

39:16.728 --> 39:18.789
And i know why sometimes
you snap, because...

39:18.831 --> 39:20.601
You're stressed...

39:20.632 --> 39:22.463
From taking care
of everybody.

39:22.501 --> 39:24.871
I don't think those lists
were meant to make us
focus on all the bad stuff.

39:28.974 --> 39:30.614
Rita's done!

40:20.826 --> 40:21.996
I never gave
you a present.

40:33.706 --> 40:35.905
"super callie"?

40:35.942 --> 40:38.672
I know it's stupid,
but marvel already took
all the good names.

40:39.911 --> 40:41.581
You're such a dork.

40:51.824 --> 40:52.853
I'm sorry.

40:54.827 --> 40:56.827
I know nothing's gonna
happen while we're under
the same roof.

40:59.664 --> 41:01.605
Well, there's
no rooheref .
