00:14.600 --> 00:16.566
- and every month,
do you realize that Game Shakers

00:16.567 --> 00:21.432
is spending over $3,000
on snacks and beverages?

00:21.433 --> 00:22.732
- No way, wow.

00:22.733 --> 00:26.066
- Babe, this business stuff
is important.

00:26.067 --> 00:27.866
- And it's also important

00:27.867 --> 00:28.932
that I get this glue
all over my fingers,

00:28.933 --> 00:32.699
so it can dry,
and then I can peel it off.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.432
- Okay.
Avoid the obstacles.

00:34.433 --> 00:34.933
Watch out!
Watch out!

00:34.934 --> 00:37.799
Juuuuuump...

00:37.800 --> 00:39.232
Ooo! Pass that butt!

00:39.233 --> 00:41.466
- Oh I'll pass that butt!
Right after I...

00:41.467 --> 00:42.932
Ah! Owww!

00:42.933 --> 00:44.599
- What's wrong?

00:44.600 --> 00:48.699
- Ah, it's my hand...
It's been hurtin' all week.

00:48.700 --> 00:51.299
- Want me to massage it?

00:51.300 --> 00:54.899
- No!
No, I don't want that to happen.

00:54.900 --> 00:56.299
- All right, Trip...

00:56.300 --> 00:58.532
you just need to
man up and get the surgery.

00:58.533 --> 00:59.167
- No I don't!

00:59.168 --> 01:01.066
- Surgery for what?

01:01.067 --> 01:03.732
- His hand... Trip has
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.

01:03.733 --> 01:05.932
- Aw noooooo!!!

01:05.933 --> 01:08.066
Oh my God buddy, I'm so sorry!

01:08.067 --> 01:09.199
- What are you?
What are you doing?

01:09.200 --> 01:10.932
- Just give me a hug.
- Dude...

01:10.933 --> 01:12.066
- Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
isn't a big deal.

01:12.067 --> 01:15.199
- It's just a pinched
nerve in your wrist.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.799
But if you get the surgery...

01:16.800 --> 01:19.232
- Ahh, that's the customer
service line.

01:19.233 --> 01:21.267
Hudson, will you answer that?
- All over it.

01:23.833 --> 01:25.899
Hello.

01:25.900 --> 01:26.833
You've reached Game Shakers.

01:26.834 --> 01:28.599
- Yeah hi, uh...

01:28.600 --> 01:32.066
could I please get some
help with your game, Sky Whale?

01:32.067 --> 01:33.299
- Sure.
What's your question?

01:33.300 --> 01:36.166
- Well see, I'm really good
at making the narwhal

01:36.167 --> 01:38.299
eat the donuts
when I'm in the air...

01:38.300 --> 01:41.466
- Oh! Okay so...
- Uh, one moment, please hold.

01:41.467 --> 01:43.099
Hey! Let me handle
this call, all right?

01:43.100 --> 01:44.732
- Why?
- 'Cuz...

01:44.733 --> 01:46.832
I got a feelin' about this girl.

01:46.833 --> 01:50.566
- Well okay playa,

01:50.567 --> 01:51.567
go for it.

01:53.467 --> 01:55.899
- Ahem, yes, uh...
to answer your question,

01:55.900 --> 01:59.599
it'd help if we video chat.

01:59.600 --> 02:00.467
- Uh... okay, sure.

02:00.468 --> 02:02.533
- One moment while I connect.

02:04.167 --> 02:05.499
- Y'know, Trip really
shouldn't be using

02:05.500 --> 02:07.632
our customer service line
to meet girls.

02:07.633 --> 02:09.366
That's not very professional.

02:09.367 --> 02:12.266
- I know, it's really not right.
- Wait, where ya goin'?

02:12.267 --> 02:14.100
- I wanna see if
this chick's hot.

02:15.533 --> 02:16.333
- Check it out.

02:16.334 --> 02:19.466
This girl's gonna be amazin'.

02:19.467 --> 02:22.166
- Dude, you can't tell what
a girl looks like by her voice.

02:22.167 --> 02:23.899
- I can.
It's like a gift I have.

02:23.900 --> 02:27.499
Watch this.

02:27.500 --> 02:28.632
- Oh yeah!

02:28.633 --> 02:30.932
- Hello?
Can you see me okay?

02:30.933 --> 02:33.766
- I see you just fine.

02:33.767 --> 02:35.166
- Cool. So...

02:35.167 --> 02:37.299
I'm really good
at making the narwhal

02:37.300 --> 02:39.432
eat the donuts
when I'm in the air...

02:39.433 --> 02:42.766
but I can never make him get
the donuts when I'm under water.

02:42.767 --> 02:44.066
- Oh, that's easy.

02:44.067 --> 02:45.866
All ya need to do is
just time it out so...

02:45.867 --> 02:49.366
- Ahhhh, uh yeah, see,

02:49.367 --> 02:52.199
the under water element
of the game can be tricky.

02:52.200 --> 02:54.066
It'd be easier for me
to show you how to do it

02:54.067 --> 02:57.299
in person.

02:57.300 --> 02:59.332
Uh, are you here in New York?

02:59.333 --> 03:02.132
- Well, yeah, I live
on the Upper East Side.

03:02.133 --> 03:04.232
- Ah. Cool.

03:04.233 --> 03:05.966
So, why don't you and I
meet somewhere tonight?

03:05.967 --> 03:08.066
- Oh. Uh... thanks,

03:08.067 --> 03:10.632
but I'm busy and, like,

03:10.633 --> 03:13.566
I-I have a boyfriend,
and I think I have a fever,

03:13.567 --> 03:16.132
so...

03:16.133 --> 03:17.599
- Trip!
Yo Trip!

03:17.600 --> 03:18.932
Hey! I need a trash can
for this sandwich!

03:18.933 --> 03:21.466
Where's the trash can?

03:21.467 --> 03:23.766
- There's a trash can
right over there.

03:23.767 --> 03:26.166
- Ah, that's too far.

03:26.167 --> 03:27.666
- Uhhh...
what's going on?

03:27.667 --> 03:29.399
- Uh, nothin'...
just uh...

03:29.400 --> 03:31.132
- Hey, what up
with your sandwich rage?

03:31.133 --> 03:33.366
- I'll tell ya...
Okay?

03:33.367 --> 03:34.466
I wanted a Canadian club
sandwich...

03:34.467 --> 03:38.766
but Bunny here got me
a Mexican Montay Kristo.

03:38.767 --> 03:41.532
- Dad, please! I'm on
an important business call.

03:41.533 --> 03:44.366
- Well, I'm here on time
so let's start this meeting.

03:44.367 --> 03:48.067
- The meeting was yesterday.
You missed it.

03:50.333 --> 03:51.100
- I had it down for today.

03:51.101 --> 03:53.499
- Well ya had it down wrong.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.966
Aren't ya tired of
getting everything wrong?

03:55.967 --> 03:57.599
- I... I ye...

03:57.600 --> 04:00.066
- You know what it is?
It's the Meat Pockets.

04:00.067 --> 04:01.299
Yeah, you eatin' too many
of them Meat Pockets.

04:01.300 --> 04:04.666
It's startin' to klug up
your mental brain activities.

04:04.667 --> 04:06.566
- Dub, wait...

04:06.567 --> 04:09.266
I wanted a Canadian
club sandwich!

04:09.267 --> 04:10.966
- Dub! I'm just a person.

04:10.967 --> 04:12.500
- Yeah... Not really!

04:14.067 --> 04:15.432
- Hey uh, sorry about my dad.

04:15.433 --> 04:17.099
- Oh my God!

04:17.100 --> 04:21.499

04:21.500 --> 04:24.632

04:24.633 --> 04:27.832

04:29.533 --> 04:32.732

04:34.167 --> 04:35.432

06:03.833 --> 06:05.066
- Yeeaaahh.

06:05.067 --> 06:06.266
Tonight I'm gonna do my toes.

06:06.267 --> 06:08.099
You should try it.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.567
- Nooo.

06:11.633 --> 06:13.399
- What's up, lady Game Shakers?

06:13.400 --> 06:15.099
- Nada mucho.
- Hey Hudson.

06:15.100 --> 06:16.499
- Where's Trip?

06:16.500 --> 06:18.266
- He's on another date
with "Shanelle".

06:18.267 --> 06:22.299
- Whoa. That girl
must really like him.

06:22.300 --> 06:24.566
- Oh please.
The only reason "Shanelle"

06:24.567 --> 06:26.299
is paying so much
attention to Trip

06:26.300 --> 06:28.066
is 'cuz she wants
to hang out with Dub,

06:28.067 --> 06:29.067
'cuz he's a big celebrity.

06:29.068 --> 06:31.832
- Or she might really like Trip.

06:31.833 --> 06:33.366
- Dude...
when Trip first asked her out,

06:33.367 --> 06:35.166
she was all,
"Uhhh, sorry, I'm sick,

06:35.167 --> 06:38.266
and my boyfriend's on fire"

06:38.267 --> 06:39.299
And then, as soon as Trip said,

06:39.300 --> 06:42.499
"Well hey girl...
Y'know, Double G's my dad"

06:42.500 --> 06:45.466
She totally changed
her 'tude and was all,

06:45.467 --> 06:47.266
"Oh my God, we should
totally hang out,

06:47.267 --> 06:51.566
you're so cute,
oh my God."

06:51.567 --> 06:53.166
- Wow... you're good
at doing voices.

06:53.167 --> 06:54.133
- Yeah.
Can you do my voice?

06:54.134 --> 06:57.499
- Yeah. Can you do my voice?

06:57.500 --> 07:00.500
- Whooaa!
Now do Babe!

07:03.267 --> 07:06.166
- Hey, are you gonna
finish that spaghetti?

07:06.167 --> 07:07.399
- Uhhh...

07:07.400 --> 07:09.400
- Yeah, I'll eat it.

07:14.833 --> 07:18.299
Ooo, Game Shakers
customer service call.

07:18.300 --> 07:19.899
- Wait, what do you mean?

07:19.900 --> 07:22.132
- I forwarded our customer
service line to my cell.

07:22.133 --> 07:24.899
Shhhh.

07:24.900 --> 07:26.199
Hello.

07:26.200 --> 07:29.299
You've reached the Game Shakers
customer service hotline.

07:29.300 --> 07:30.532
Uh-huh...

07:30.533 --> 07:34.366
Y'know, it'd be a lot easier
for me to show you

07:34.367 --> 07:36.832
how to do that... in person.

07:36.833 --> 07:39.266
- Great. The boys have turned
our customer service line

07:39.267 --> 07:40.332
into their own personal
dating service.

07:40.333 --> 07:44.066
- And they take our spaghetti.

07:44.067 --> 07:45.366
- Yeah... sure.

07:45.367 --> 07:47.466
I'll meet you there in an hour.

07:47.467 --> 07:51.599
Bye Sophia.

07:51.600 --> 07:54.566
That was Sophia.
I'm gonna go meet her.

07:54.567 --> 07:55.300
- Dude, goin' to meet
someone you don't know

07:55.301 --> 07:57.499
is really dumb.

07:57.500 --> 08:00.567
- Relaaax.
I know what I'm doin'.

08:12.233 --> 08:14.666
- Yeah! I'm riding a bus!

08:14.667 --> 08:17.599
- We launched the game
in April... right?

08:17.600 --> 08:21.067
And our first update was
in July, so that would...

08:23.067 --> 08:25.666
Okay, I think you're starting
to get a little obsessed

08:25.667 --> 08:27.266
with putting glue on your hands.

08:27.267 --> 08:29.700
- I'm not obsessed.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.699
- Uh-huh.

08:38.700 --> 08:39.267
- Hey! Hey!
She's comin'! She's comin'!

08:39.268 --> 08:41.166
- Who's comin'?

08:41.167 --> 08:42.932
- Shanelle!

08:42.933 --> 08:44.632
Awww, why does it smell
like garlic in here?!?

08:44.633 --> 08:45.300
- We're eating a pizza.

08:45.301 --> 08:47.566
- Where's the Le Breeze?

08:47.567 --> 08:48.832
Where'd you all put
all the Le Breeze?!?

08:48.833 --> 08:50.833
- It's right there,
on the thing.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.800
No. No...

09:01.367 --> 09:04.299
- Ahhh!!!

09:04.300 --> 09:06.166

09:06.167 --> 09:08.332

09:09.234 --> 09:13.366

09:13.367 --> 09:15.299

09:15.300 --> 09:18.299
- Yes you l'do.

09:18.300 --> 09:19.466
Oh, uh... Shanelle,

09:30.300 --> 09:32.499
No way! Double G! Hi!

09:32.500 --> 09:33.932

- Ulch...

09:36.533 --> 09:38.432
- And I'm also a singer
and a dancer!

09:38.433 --> 09:41.766
- Wow, that's so interesting.

09:41.767 --> 09:43.299
Uh, why don'tcha tell
Bunny all about it,

09:43.300 --> 09:45.666

09:45.667 --> 09:48.266
- What? Oh no. Wait just...
- Come on. No.

09:48.267 --> 09:49.466
- All right Trip...

09:49.467 --> 09:51.832
You're all ready
for your surgery

09:51.833 --> 09:54.966
tomorrow at 4:30
at Peter Sinai Hospital.

09:54.967 --> 09:56.399
- Whoa, you're having
the surgery tomorrow?

09:56.400 --> 09:58.932
- Yeah...
Doctor says I have to.

09:58.933 --> 10:00.332
- Awww, don't worry,
it'll go fine.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.799
- That's right.
And by tomorrow night,

10:02.800 --> 10:05.332
you'll have a brand new heart.

10:05.333 --> 10:07.832
- Yeah, I mean...
New heart?!?

10:07.833 --> 10:09.399
- Yeah, you can't do
a heart transplant

10:09.400 --> 10:10.367
without a new heart.

10:10.368 --> 10:12.032
- Dub!!!

10:12.033 --> 10:14.232
- Trip doesn't need
a heart transplant!

10:14.233 --> 10:17.799
- I need wrist surgery for my
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome!

10:17.800 --> 10:20.032
Wait, wait wait a minute,
your your wrist?!?

10:20.033 --> 10:21.166
Aww... Bunny...?

10:21.167 --> 10:22.532
- Yeah Dub?

10:22.533 --> 10:24.432
- Why'd you tell me
I need to buy

10:24.433 --> 10:25.466
a new heart for Trip's surgery?

10:25.467 --> 10:26.367
- I thought he needed one?

10:26.368 --> 10:28.599
- Well he doesn't need one!

10:28.600 --> 10:31.999
He just has
the Carmel Apple Syndrome!

10:32.000 --> 10:34.366
- Relax Dad, I just need you
to be there at the hospital

10:34.367 --> 10:36.732
with me when I have
the surgery. Okay?

10:36.733 --> 10:38.432
- All right, all right,
I'll be there.

10:38.433 --> 10:40.966
- Uhhh...
Double G?

10:40.967 --> 10:42.366
You're going to be
at the hospital tomorrow?

10:42.367 --> 10:44.632
- Yeah, Trip's gettin' surgery

10:44.633 --> 10:47.132
for his
Purple Toe Nail Syndrome.

10:47.133 --> 10:49.832
- Awww, Trip... I didn't know
you were having surgery.

10:49.833 --> 10:52.599
- Yeah, well I told you
I was having surgery, so...

10:52.600 --> 10:54.199
- Well, I wanna be there.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.332
With you. For you.

10:56.333 --> 11:00.632
Me and your dad'll
be there together.

11:00.633 --> 11:02.066
- Awwww. That's so sweet.

11:02.067 --> 11:04.866
- Yeah.
And while you're in surgery...

11:04.867 --> 11:07.232
Maybe your dad
can help me with advice

11:07.233 --> 11:07.767
about my singing career.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.432
- Mmmm... yeah,

11:09.433 --> 11:12.066
that sounds like
a good time... bye.

11:12.067 --> 11:13.732
- Oh, well, wait wait wait.
- Dub, wait for me.

11:13.733 --> 11:16.066
- No Bunny, I will
not wait for you.

11:16.067 --> 11:18.600
If you wanna hang out with me
you gonna' have to catch up.

11:20.533 --> 11:22.266
- Wait Dub!
I love you!

11:22.267 --> 11:23.466
- Shut up Bunny!

11:23.467 --> 11:25.766
- Wow, that's so cool!

11:25.767 --> 11:27.499
Does Double G come by a lot?

11:27.500 --> 11:29.567
- A lot more than we want, yes.

11:31.400 --> 11:34.867
- Ohhh... yeah...
ehe...

11:41.700 --> 11:43.699
- I'm sorry, but I don't see how

11:43.700 --> 11:44.766
you can still think
Shanelle's a bad person.

11:44.767 --> 11:46.299
- Uh, how much more
evidence do you need?

11:46.300 --> 11:49.799
- But she offered to go
all the way to the hospital,

11:49.800 --> 11:51.832
just to be with Trip
while he gets his surgery.

11:51.833 --> 11:53.566
- She offered
after she found out

11:53.567 --> 11:55.366
Dub was gonna be there,

11:55.367 --> 11:57.199
'cuz all that girl
cares about is Dub

11:57.200 --> 11:59.066
'cuz he's a star.

11:59.067 --> 12:00.867
- So, you think Shanelle is a...
- Star skazz.

12:01.601 --> 12:03.699
But, what if you're wrong?

12:03.700 --> 12:04.700
What if she is a nice girl?

12:04.701 --> 12:07.466
You don't wanna
skazz-shame a nice girl.

12:07.467 --> 12:10.966
- Okay...
then let's test her.

12:10.967 --> 12:12.432
Let's find out if she
really likes Trip or not.

12:12.433 --> 12:14.432
- How?

12:16.433 --> 12:19.800
- You see her?

12:21.067 --> 12:23.066
You want that to be you
in fifty years?

12:23.067 --> 12:24.532
'Cuz that's where you're
headed with your little...

12:24.533 --> 12:28.067
glue habbit.

12:35.500 --> 12:36.780
- I swear this is
my last bottle.

12:48.067 --> 12:49.932
- Ulch.
You're such a baby.

12:49.933 --> 12:52.266
I just don't like
lying to people,

12:52.267 --> 12:54.832
especially a nice man
like Bunny.

12:54.833 --> 12:56.632
- Look! We're not gonna
be hurting Bunny.

12:56.633 --> 12:58.914
And anyway, we're only doing
this 'cuz we care about Trip.

13:03.367 --> 13:04.766
- Hey.
You guys want some carrot mush?

13:04.767 --> 13:08.199
- Why are you making
mushy carrots?

13:08.200 --> 13:10.099
- It's for my new friend,
Sophia...

13:10.100 --> 13:11.166
The one I met on our
customer service line.

13:11.167 --> 13:14.766
- Oh... so you're like,
into this girl now?

13:14.767 --> 13:16.532
- I guess.

13:16.533 --> 13:17.832
Yesterday she was asking me
questions about our games,

13:17.833 --> 13:21.532
and we just had a
lotta fun hangin' out...

13:21.533 --> 13:22.699
talking... y'know.

13:22.700 --> 13:26.899
- So, now you're gonna
take her some carrot mush?

13:26.900 --> 13:30.232
- Yep.
It's her favorite treat.

13:30.233 --> 13:33.366
- Is she a turtle?
- Mmhmm.

13:33.367 --> 13:34.466
- Nah.

13:34.467 --> 13:37.067
But her head does
kinda retract into her neck.

13:38.667 --> 13:41.732
- Oh...
So um...

13:41.733 --> 13:42.832
how old is Sophia?

13:42.833 --> 13:45.799
- Uh... I think she
said somethin' like...

13:45.800 --> 13:47.732
19... maybe 29...

13:47.733 --> 13:50.466
- Whoa whoa...

13:50.467 --> 13:52.666
Sophia is either 19 or 29?

13:52.667 --> 13:54.966
- Nah nah nah...

13:54.967 --> 13:57.966
I think she was born in 1929.

13:57.967 --> 14:00.966
- That would make Sophia
close to 90 years old.

14:00.967 --> 14:03.232
- Yeah, that's about right.

14:03.233 --> 14:05.066
She lives in a that
home for old people,

14:05.067 --> 14:06.599
in Crown Heights.

14:06.600 --> 14:07.732
- Sagging Meadows?

14:07.733 --> 14:10.066
- That's it.

14:10.067 --> 14:12.333
Well... I better hurry and
get this carrot mush to her.

14:15.267 --> 14:17.966
- Oh! Hey Bunny.
- Ooo, is that carrot mush?

14:17.967 --> 14:20.299
- Yep.
Hehehehehe....

14:20.300 --> 14:22.532
- Hey girls. I got your text,
what do you guys need?

14:22.533 --> 14:23.732
- Oh, uh...

14:23.733 --> 14:26.666
- Well we were at Wall Booms,
and we got ya these.

14:26.667 --> 14:27.866
- Ooo, Meat Pockets!

14:27.867 --> 14:29.899
These are my favorite.

14:29.900 --> 14:31.732
- Yeah, we know.

14:31.733 --> 14:35.799
- You can have these tonight
before Dub's pop-up concert.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.866
- Wait...
what pop-up concert?

14:37.867 --> 14:41.099
- Awww, Bunny.
- Ohhhh Bunny noooo.

14:41.100 --> 14:42.299
- But I don't know...

14:42.300 --> 14:43.899
- Dude, if you screw up
Dub's schedule again,

14:43.900 --> 14:46.266
he might fire you.

14:46.267 --> 14:48.132
- We don't want you
to get fired.

14:48.133 --> 14:49.532
- Yeah, me neither.
- Uh uh...

14:49.533 --> 14:51.266
- So, where's this
pop-up concert at?!?

14:51.267 --> 14:52.732
- Oh, uhhh...
- Uh, ohhh...

14:52.733 --> 14:55.266
- Sagging Meadows.

14:55.267 --> 14:57.932
- That retirement home
in Crown Heights?

14:57.933 --> 14:59.432
- Yep.
- Exactly.

14:59.433 --> 15:01.066
- So, you better make
sure Dub's there,

15:01.067 --> 15:02.932
ready to perform,
at six o'clock.

15:02.933 --> 15:04.732
- Six o'clock..
But wait...

15:04.733 --> 15:07.966
Dub's supposed to go be
with Trip at the hospital.

15:07.967 --> 15:08.900
- Ah, we'll take care of Trip.

15:08.901 --> 15:11.599
- Tell Dub not
to worry about Trip.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.232
- Okay... just make sure Dub
gets to Sagging Meadows.

15:13.233 --> 15:15.199
- Okay, I understand.
- Don't mess this up.

15:15.200 --> 15:18.400
- Go tell Dub.
- Run like a Bunny.

15:26.300 --> 15:29.232
- So...
is Triple G unconscious?

15:29.233 --> 15:33.666
- Not yet. But I think
the anesthesia's working.

15:33.667 --> 15:34.766
Trip...

15:34.767 --> 15:36.099
can you tell me the name

15:36.100 --> 15:38.133
of the President
of the United States?

15:40.100 --> 15:42.932
- I love you, man.

15:42.933 --> 15:46.667
- We'll start the surgery
in a few minutes.

15:49.333 --> 15:52.932
- Dad...
Dad... are you here?

15:52.933 --> 15:55.166
- Nooo...

15:55.167 --> 15:56.566
but your dad's
supposed to be here.

15:56.567 --> 15:59.899
How come he's...

15:59.900 --> 16:01.800
Your phone's ringing.

16:06.100 --> 16:10.700
- Hey!!!
Is that you Daddy?

16:11.067 --> 16:14.899
- Triple G's phone,
what do you want?

16:14.900 --> 16:16.099
- Oh, hi Shanelle.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.067
Are you with Trip
at the hospital?

16:17.068 --> 16:19.699
- Yeah, where's Double G?

16:19.700 --> 16:21.499
He said he was gonna be here.

16:21.500 --> 16:22.832
- Right, he was...

16:22.833 --> 16:25.332
but now he's gotta do
a surprise pop-up concert...

16:25.333 --> 16:27.332
'bout an hour from now.

16:27.333 --> 16:30.199
- Wait... Double G's
not coming to this hospital?

16:30.200 --> 16:32.732
- No... but I'm not worried

16:32.733 --> 16:35.066
'cuz you're gonna stay
there with Trip, right?

16:35.067 --> 16:36.932
Which is so nice of you.
- Yeah yeah...

16:36.933 --> 16:40.266
where's Double G
doing his pop-up concert?

16:40.267 --> 16:41.866
- I think it's at that
home for elderlies,

16:41.867 --> 16:44.166
Sagging Meadows.

16:44.167 --> 16:46.466
- Sagging Meadows.
- Yeah.

16:46.467 --> 16:49.333
Anyway, thanks for
taking care of Trip... byeeee.

16:53.333 --> 16:55.633
- Trip?
Trip, can you hear me?

17:03.567 --> 17:06.066
- I'm going to Sagging Meadows,
to bust her.

17:06.067 --> 17:08.732
- Good.
Bust that skazz.

17:08.733 --> 17:10.066
- You need to go down to the
hospital to look after Trip.

17:10.067 --> 17:12.066
- Got it.

17:12.067 --> 17:13.499
- Oh! And hey,

17:13.500 --> 17:16.066
no more putting
glue on your hands... promise?

17:16.067 --> 17:18.132
- Yes, I promise.

17:18.133 --> 17:20.133
- Good girl.

17:21.533 --> 17:24.233
- Promise not to
tell you about it.

17:37.667 --> 17:39.066
- Hey, Hudson...

17:39.067 --> 17:42.066
- Oh... wow.
What are you doin' here?

17:42.067 --> 17:43.932
- I'm lookin' for a skazz.

17:43.933 --> 17:47.699
- Oh.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.699
- Hey...
what time does Double G go on?

17:49.700 --> 17:50.767
- I don't know.

17:52.933 --> 17:57.966
- Well hellooooo.

17:57.967 --> 18:00.066
- Oh. Babe. Hi.
I'm...

18:00.067 --> 18:03.299
- A skazz?
- Hey.

18:03.300 --> 18:04.133
- You're supposed to be
at the hospital,

18:04.134 --> 18:06.099
making sure Trip's okay.

18:06.100 --> 18:08.366
- Oh, who cares about Trip?

18:08.367 --> 18:10.166
- Uh, pretty much
everyone but you.

18:10.167 --> 18:11.799
And I'm gonna tell Trip

18:11.800 --> 18:13.732
that you've just been using him
to get to Double G.

18:13.733 --> 18:15.066
- Pfft. So?

18:15.067 --> 18:17.832
Trip's like in love with me,

18:17.833 --> 18:19.432
he's not gonna believe you.

18:19.433 --> 18:22.732
- Oh. So, you're just
gonna keep on using Trip,

18:22.733 --> 18:25.866
even though you don't
really care about him at all?

18:25.867 --> 18:26.932
- That's right.

18:26.933 --> 18:30.066
- Well, thank you.
I really appreciate it.

18:30.067 --> 18:32.566
- Appreciate what?

18:32.567 --> 18:34.099
- You saying that
stuff into my phone

18:34.100 --> 18:35.266
so now I can play it for Trip.

18:35.267 --> 18:36.832
- You... you better
delete that!

18:36.833 --> 18:38.466
- Well girl, you better
delete that attitude!

18:38.467 --> 18:41.266
Get off my phone!
- Give me the phone.

18:41.267 --> 18:44.432
Uh-oh, don't panic...

18:44.433 --> 18:46.499
It's okay everyone!

18:46.500 --> 18:49.366
She's just choking
on some carrots!

18:49.367 --> 18:52.232
Stay with me, Sophia!
It's not your time!

18:52.233 --> 18:55.266
Put your arms up like this!

18:55.267 --> 18:57.400
There ya go...

18:59.067 --> 19:02.066
- Ulch!

19:02.067 --> 19:06.432
What is on my face?!?

19:06.433 --> 19:08.332
- Uh, I'm not sure...

19:08.333 --> 19:11.099
but it came outta
that lady over there.

19:11.100 --> 19:13.867
- Ahh!

19:16.600 --> 19:19.467
- Okay!
Let's get together never!

19:22.567 --> 19:27.632
- Shanelle...?
Shanelle...

19:27.633 --> 19:32.132
Oh... Shanelle...?
Shanelle...

19:32.133 --> 19:34.166
Mmmm...
Shanelle...

19:34.167 --> 19:36.632
- Wake up.
- Trip, wake up.

19:36.633 --> 19:38.967
- Ooo! In movies, they
wake people up like this...

19:46.067 --> 19:48.466
- Owwww!
- Hudson!

19:48.467 --> 19:50.932
- You're supposed to throw
the water in his face.

19:50.933 --> 19:52.932
- Not the cup.

19:52.933 --> 19:58.599
- Well it worked.
He's awake.

19:58.600 --> 20:01.866
- Hey.
Wh-where's Shanelle?

20:01.867 --> 20:04.266
- We um...

20:04.267 --> 20:09.799
we... we got rid of Shanelle.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.599
- Pfft... Wait...

20:11.600 --> 20:13.299
W-what do you mean you
got rid of Shanelle?

20:13.300 --> 20:17.132
- Look, we're sorry, but she...

20:17.133 --> 20:19.933
she didn't really like you.

20:22.167 --> 20:23.466
- Huh?

20:23.467 --> 20:26.099
- Shanelle was just using you...

20:26.100 --> 20:30.099
because Dub's your dad.

20:30.100 --> 20:33.332
- Well DUHHHHHH.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.299
You think I didn't know that?!?

20:35.300 --> 20:36.599
- Wait, if you knew Shanelle

20:36.600 --> 20:37.766
was just using you
to get to Dub...

20:37.767 --> 20:39.432
- then why would you
wanna go out with her?

20:39.433 --> 20:43.266
- Uhh...
'Cuz she's hot!

20:43.267 --> 20:44.599
What, do you all
think I'm stupid?!?

20:44.600 --> 20:45.200
- Well no!
- Well no, of course not!

20:45.201 --> 20:49.132
- Sometimes.

20:49.133 --> 20:50.432
- Aw man.
You guys wrecked

20:50.433 --> 20:52.166
the best relationship
I ever had.

20:52.167 --> 20:55.566
- We thought we
were helping you!

20:55.567 --> 20:58.232
- And hey, uh...
How come my dad's not here?

20:58.233 --> 21:00.366
- Uh. Well see...

21:00.367 --> 21:02.232
We made Dub think
he was supposed to do

21:02.233 --> 21:04.599
a pop-up concert
at a home for elderlies.

21:04.600 --> 21:06.299
- Wait...

21:06.300 --> 21:07.666
My dad's doing a pop-up
concert tonight?

21:07.667 --> 21:09.866
- Well, no 'cuz
Kenzie called him

21:09.867 --> 21:11.532
and told him he's not
really supposed to do it.

21:11.533 --> 21:14.532
- Nooo, you were gonna call him.

21:14.533 --> 21:17.299
- Noooo, you said you were...
Whoa whoa...

21:17.300 --> 21:19.732
neither of us called Dub

21:19.733 --> 21:21.773
and told him not to go
perform at Sagging Meadows?!?
