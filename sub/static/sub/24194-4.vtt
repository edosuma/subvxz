RICHARD HENDRICKS:
Are you suggesting that

00:11.336 --> 00:14.044
someone in here is leaking info
to Gavin Belson?

00:14.044 --> 00:15.878
Tell me about these... fridges.

00:15.878 --> 00:17.420
It's a company secret.

00:17.420 --> 00:19.795
Do you want to save a fortune,
or not?

00:19.795 --> 00:20.670
Well, yes.

00:20.962 --> 00:22.920
In exchange, I need you to do
something for me,

00:22.920 --> 00:25.128
with regard to the people
who hacked your refrigerators.

00:25.378 --> 00:27.044
I'm going to destroy
their lives.

00:27.628 --> 00:30.962
Jared, do you think it's...
time we hire a COO?

00:30.962 --> 00:32.837
You're 20-30 pounds underweight.

00:32.837 --> 00:34.086
Don't worry about him.

00:34.086 --> 00:36.128
We're gonna find you
a much better COO.

-All right-- Ugh. All right.

00:49.086 --> 00:51.586
Okay, everybody, um,
thanks for coming.

00:51.586 --> 00:52.920
Uh, sorry about the venue.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.420

security issue.

00:55.420 --> 00:56.670

00:56.670 --> 00:58.336
hosting you guys
at-- at our offices.

00:58.336 --> 01:00.211
But, hey, at least out here,

01:00.211 --> 01:01.586
we don't run the risk

01:01.586 --> 01:03.586
of running into anyone
from the tech industry.

01:03.586 --> 01:05.962
Yeah, they're all so old.

01:11.503 --> 01:13.336

you guys to meet,

01:13.336 --> 01:16.294

being a very diverse

01:16.294 --> 01:18.878

young web developers--

01:18.878 --> 01:22.003

Social coding platform.

01:27.211 --> 01:28.712
Gay dating site.

01:28.712 --> 01:31.378
Okay, technically,
you're a dating site,

01:31.378 --> 01:33.378
but specifically, a gay one.

01:33.378 --> 01:35.503
Which is a subset,
so I'm not wrong.

01:35.503 --> 01:37.795
Anyway, uh, despite
all our differences,

01:37.795 --> 01:40.253
we all have one thing
in common, right?

01:40.253 --> 01:42.169
A signed agreement with me

01:42.169 --> 01:44.712
to build and launch
your websites,

01:44.712 --> 01:47.878
not on the tired,
bloated, old web,

01:47.878 --> 01:51.128
but on the new
Internet of the future.

01:51.128 --> 01:52.503
The Pipernet.

01:52.503 --> 01:55.461
Which is why,
from this day forward,

01:55.461 --> 01:57.461
I'm going to be naming
the eight of you...

01:57.461 --> 01:59.044
the OctoPipers.

02:02.003 --> 02:03.545
Until something better, TBD.

02:03.545 --> 02:04.837
So when can
we tell people?

02:04.837 --> 02:06.253
Soon! Actually, very soon.

02:06.253 --> 02:09.837
Uh, next Tuesday,
Gavin Belson is, uh...

02:09.837 --> 02:11.336
launching his Box Three.

02:11.336 --> 02:13.336
So, um, the day before,

02:13.336 --> 02:16.712
we are going to announce
our partnerships with you all,

02:16.712 --> 02:18.211
and beat him to the punch.

02:18.211 --> 02:20.128
Shit. He's gonna be
super pissed.

02:20.128 --> 02:21.753
Man:
He's really gonna
come after us.

02:21.753 --> 02:24.044
Yeah, he is,
but fuck him.

02:24.044 --> 02:25.586
Not butt fuck him.

02:25.586 --> 02:27.503
Just...
You don't have to explain

02:27.503 --> 02:29.545
that kinda stuff.
I-I know what you mean.

02:29.545 --> 02:31.420
Yeah, I know. Look-- look.

02:31.420 --> 02:33.420
As long as we stick together,

02:33.420 --> 02:35.586
and support each other,
we can crush him.

02:35.586 --> 02:38.003
Because what we are doing
is amazing, okay?

02:38.003 --> 02:40.211
We are building the world's
first truly open,

02:40.211 --> 02:43.294
truly free
de-centralized Internet.

02:43.294 --> 02:46.753
And I tell you what,
I got a sneak preview
for you guys, okay?

02:46.753 --> 02:48.420
Because as of this morning,

02:48.420 --> 02:51.628

What!

02:51.628 --> 02:53.503
Cool.
Yeah.

02:53.503 --> 02:54.962
Really? So cool!

peer-to-peer Internet.

03:04.086 --> 03:05.795
Ready?

03:07.253 --> 03:08.962
"Hit her."

03:08.962 --> 03:11.795
I don't get it.
Are you talking about me?

03:11.795 --> 03:13.128
I meant to say "Hi there."

03:13.128 --> 03:15.461
Well, it definitely
says "Hit her."

03:15.461 --> 03:17.294
I'll try it again.
There's a new one.

03:17.294 --> 03:18.920
There. "Hi there."

No, it's--
it's totally cool.

Oh! Wait a minute, no,
I don't mean you are anti-gay.

03:33.670 --> 03:35.169
I mean the opposite.
Like, are you worried

03:35.169 --> 03:37.086
that we're excluding
straight people?

03:37.086 --> 03:38.336
Oh.
I just remember you said,

you want your new Internet
to be open for everybody,

to make sure we're jibing

people you want.

Yep.

know we are on to you,

09:27.962 --> 09:30.336
In addition to being
business associates,

09:30.336 --> 09:32.795
the CEO and I take
medically prescribed

09:32.795 --> 09:34.670
and supervised
MDMA together.

09:34.670 --> 09:37.211
I'm taking it for severe
post-partum depression.

09:37.211 --> 09:39.670
I do not know
why he is taking it.

09:39.670 --> 09:41.878
Regardless, when
I saw him yesterday,

09:41.878 --> 09:45.670
he was quite euphoric
about speaking to you
regarding a deal.

09:45.670 --> 09:47.336
K
The creators of the game

09:47.336 --> 09:49.878
"Undead Sex Offender"?
They're-- they're huge.

09:49.878 --> 09:53.545
Yeah! Yeah, partnering
with a company
of that size this early

09:53.545 --> 09:55.044
would put us months ahead.

09:55.044 --> 09:57.253
This is not a done deal.

09:57.253 --> 10:00.253
K-Hole is protective
of its brand.

10:00.253 --> 10:01.712
They will want
to speak to you

10:01.712 --> 10:03.461
regarding who else
you are dealing with.

10:03.461 --> 10:05.878
Okay, right, well, um...

10:05.878 --> 10:07.420
why don't I just
bring the OctoPipers?

10:07.420 --> 10:10.503
New name to come,
though it's pretty
popular around here.

10:10.503 --> 10:13.962
Uh, they can talk to K-Hole.

10:13.962 --> 10:16.003
Tell them why they joined.

10:16.003 --> 10:19.044
Allowing you to speak less?

10:19.044 --> 10:20.753
Good strategy. Alright.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.920
K-Hole will be
expecting you
this afternoon.

10:24.169 --> 10:25.503
Knock 'em dead, Richard.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.920
Whatever you are doing,
stop it now.

10:31.420 --> 10:34.586
Um, yeah.
We're just... high-fiving.

10:34.586 --> 10:35.753
Bye.

10:35.753 --> 10:37.253
K-Hole.
I can't believe it!

10:37.253 --> 10:39.294
I'm bursting. I'm bursting!

10:39.294 --> 10:41.336
Um, here, I printed
driving directions.

10:41.336 --> 10:43.086
Oh, it's okay,
I got my phone.

10:43.086 --> 10:45.253
Well, I have marked available
bathrooms along the route.

10:50.003 --> 10:51.670
Okay, here we go.

10:51.670 --> 10:54.670
Richard, you never
return my calls.

10:54.670 --> 10:57.253
You mean the hundreds
of voicemails you've left

10:57.253 --> 11:00.795
where you just called me
a terrible CEO with no dick?

11:00.795 --> 11:02.878
Yes! You're talking
to other companies.

11:02.878 --> 11:05.378
That is not
public information.

11:05.378 --> 11:07.503
Jian-Yang:
I'm a part owner
in Pied Piper.

11:07.503 --> 11:10.420
You need to make a deal
with my companies.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.962
You mean your incubator's
spurious knock-offs

11:12.962 --> 11:15.169
of legitimate
American businesses?

11:15.169 --> 11:18.461
"New Expedia,"
"New Snapchat,"
"New Zillow"?

11:18.461 --> 11:20.878
But they're for Chinese market.

11:20.878 --> 11:23.128
It's a very
sophisticated strategy.

11:23.128 --> 11:25.294
Okay, look, taking
existing companies

11:25.294 --> 11:28.670
and just calling them "new"
isn't sophisticated.
That's theft.

11:28.670 --> 11:30.503
You make a new Internet.

11:32.420 --> 11:33.753
That is different.

11:33.753 --> 11:35.420
I-- Look, we're not
gonna make any deals

11:35.420 --> 11:37.336
with any of your
companies, okay?

11:40.962 --> 11:42.336
Don't pick up.

11:45.128 --> 11:47.586
Richard, hello.

11:47.586 --> 11:48.795
It's Jian-Yang.

11:48.795 --> 11:51.920
You are a shitty CEO.

11:54.003 --> 11:57.753
As long as I own
10% of Pied Piper,

11:57.753 --> 11:59.378
I will make chaos.

11:59.378 --> 12:01.336
Okay.

12:02.628 --> 12:04.086
I thought
you hated that car.

12:04.086 --> 12:06.628
Aviato car smells
like a dead pig.

12:06.628 --> 12:10.003
You're aware
that Russ Hanneman
urinated in that car, no?

12:11.294 --> 12:12.336
This car?

12:12.336 --> 12:13.336
Mm-hmm.

12:16.712 --> 12:17.712
Uh...

12:17.712 --> 12:19.878
are you just
gonna leave it here?
Yes.

12:19.878 --> 12:21.169
Well...

12:22.211 --> 12:23.378
looks like I have
a reason to find

12:23.378 --> 12:25.420
Pied Piper's official
towing company.

12:25.420 --> 12:26.670
I'm gonna get some bids.

12:26.670 --> 12:28.044
Yeah, while you're at it,

12:28.044 --> 12:30.420
see if you can find someone
to bash that guy's face in.

12:30.420 --> 12:33.545
Uh, I-I can do
some research.

12:39.211 --> 12:41.753
Maybe turn your phone off
during the meeting.

12:41.753 --> 12:43.586
You're a shitty CEO!

12:49.670 --> 12:51.712
Richard:
Thanks again, Colin,
for having us.

12:51.712 --> 12:53.461
Uh, the fact that
a company like yours

12:53.461 --> 12:56.086
with such a
pristine reputation
it sitting down with us

12:56.086 --> 12:57.878
is, honestly,
incredibly flattering.

12:57.878 --> 12:59.044
It's cool.

12:59.044 --> 13:00.503
Ooh, wow.

13:00.503 --> 13:02.962
That'll be a
closed casket. Yeah.

13:02.962 --> 13:04.461
Alright, well,
we thought the best way

13:04.461 --> 13:05.420
to introduce the Pipernet

13:05.420 --> 13:07.586
would be through
the eight developers

13:07.586 --> 13:08.628
that have already
signed on.

13:08.628 --> 13:10.878
Who we are calling
the OctoPipers.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.086
That's dumb.

13:13.086 --> 13:16.169
Um, anyway,
let's introduce you
to the group.

13:16.169 --> 13:18.962
Um, we've got a great
analytics tool

13:18.962 --> 13:20.753
by a former Google guru.

13:20.753 --> 13:22.586
Wish I'd have thought
of that one.
Cool.

13:22.586 --> 13:25.336
Uh, music streaming
with an AI taste predictor

13:25.336 --> 13:27.003
that is off the charts.

13:27.003 --> 13:28.003
Good space.

13:28.003 --> 13:30.503
Yes, and this handsome
devil over here,

13:30.503 --> 13:33.128
is creating a very promising
gay dating site.

13:33.128 --> 13:36.169
That's cool.
Yeah, but don't worry,
he's not snobby about it.

13:36.169 --> 13:37.461
He's actually
pretty boring.

13:37.461 --> 13:39.336
I don't mean
that as an insult.
Those are his words.

13:39.336 --> 13:41.545
Long-term relationship.
Doesn't smoke, doesn't drink.

13:41.545 --> 13:44.086
And him and his man
go to church every Sunday.

13:44.086 --> 13:45.878
So...

13:45.878 --> 13:48.211
loves Bible studies, right?

13:48.211 --> 13:50.586
Just a straight-up
boring, ordinary guy,

13:50.586 --> 13:51.753
but obviously not straight.

13:51.753 --> 13:55.211
Very gay, and also
a Christian, right?

13:56.586 --> 13:58.461
Richard:
Okay, so, that went well.

13:58.461 --> 14:01.712
It started out a little weird,
but things really picked up--
Why did you do that?

14:01.712 --> 14:03.753
Why did you say that?
Say what?

14:03.753 --> 14:05.753
Richard, you just told
a room full of tech people

14:05.753 --> 14:07.086
that I'm a
Christian.

14:07.086 --> 14:08.420
Oh.

14:08.420 --> 14:10.461
Okay, but--
but you are, aren't you?

14:10.461 --> 14:12.795
Yes, but I told you
that in confidence.

14:12.795 --> 14:14.586
I said "between you and me."

14:14.586 --> 14:17.253
I'm not openly Christian.

14:17.253 --> 14:18.753
Thanks a lot, man.

14:18.753 --> 14:19.795
You just outed me.

14:19.795 --> 14:22.253
Oh, I'm sorry, Deedee.
I didn't--

14:22.253 --> 14:25.253
Okay, um,
should we hug?

14:25.253 --> 14:27.128
I can not make it
weird this time.

14:30.420 --> 14:31.837
I'm-- I'm sorry, Richard.

14:31.837 --> 14:33.670
You know that
my default position

14:33.670 --> 14:36.753
is blind support
of whatever you do, but...

14:36.753 --> 14:38.128
this was not
your best moment.

14:38.128 --> 14:40.253
Guys, it can't be
that big of a deal, right?

14:40.253 --> 14:41.503
Why should it be?

14:41.503 --> 14:43.294
America loves Christians.

14:43.294 --> 14:44.378
Muslims are the enemy.

14:44.378 --> 14:46.128
Well, that's true
in most of America,

14:46.128 --> 14:48.712
but not in
Silicon Valley, sadly.

14:48.712 --> 14:51.545
"Sadly"?
You can be openly
polyamorous.

14:51.545 --> 14:53.670
And people here
will call you brave.

14:53.670 --> 14:56.962
You can put micro-doses
of LSD in your cereal,

14:56.962 --> 14:58.670
and-- and people
will call you a pioneer.

14:58.670 --> 15:02.294
But the one thing
you cannot be
is a Christian.

15:02.294 --> 15:04.336
I find their theology
to be illegitimate,

15:04.336 --> 15:06.586
and it's clear that
they are the source

15:06.586 --> 15:08.628
of the majority of
the world's problems.

15:08.628 --> 15:11.044
But, fuck, Richard,
even I wouldn't just...

15:11.044 --> 15:12.670
out a Christian like that.

15:12.670 --> 15:14.461
Yeah, it was
kinda fucked up.

15:14.461 --> 15:17.545
Cool man, thanks.

15:17.545 --> 15:20.211
Hey, I thought he wasn't
supposed to chime in.

15:20.211 --> 15:21.878
Yeah, he's not, but...

15:23.211 --> 15:25.044
based on its merits,
I'll allow that one.

15:25.044 --> 15:27.420
Guys,
come on.

15:27.420 --> 15:28.878
It can't be that bad.

15:28.878 --> 15:30.169
Richard!

15:30.169 --> 15:32.420
What the fuck
did you do over there?

15:32.420 --> 15:35.712
So I just got off
the phone with Colin
over at K-Hole,

15:35.712 --> 15:37.253
and while he loves your tech,

15:37.253 --> 15:39.044
he's considering
blowing up the deal.

15:39.044 --> 15:40.044
What?

15:40.044 --> 15:42.044
Just because one of
my CEOs is Christian?

15:42.044 --> 15:43.878
It freaks people out
in the Valley!

15:43.878 --> 15:46.211
Okay, so what do you
want me to do, Monica?

15:46.211 --> 15:48.962
You want me to drop Deedee
just because he's Christian?

15:48.962 --> 15:51.670
The company's not Christian.
It's gay...

15:51.670 --> 15:52.878
which is fine, right?

15:52.878 --> 15:54.753
Yeah! No, that--
that plays great.

15:54.753 --> 15:57.712
Look, cutting all ties
to Deedee and FirstSight

15:57.712 --> 16:00.253
will definitely send
a strong message to Colin.

16:00.253 --> 16:01.586
And it might be
the only way.

16:01.586 --> 16:04.086
Like killing somebody
to prove you're not a narc,

16:04.086 --> 16:06.086
or showing a john
your genitals

16:06.086 --> 16:07.962
to prove you're
a legitimate
male prostitute

16:07.962 --> 16:09.128
and not an undercover cop.

16:09.128 --> 16:11.878
What?
Because cops aren't
allowed to do that.

16:11.878 --> 16:13.294
And worst case scenario,

16:13.294 --> 16:15.128
the john walks off
with a free peek.

16:15.128 --> 16:17.586
Oh, that's the
towing company.
Excuse me.

16:18.753 --> 16:20.336
Forget it.

16:20.336 --> 16:21.878
Monica, I'm not doing it.

16:21.878 --> 16:24.086
I mean, I'm not dropping him.

16:24.086 --> 16:25.920
Alright. Fine.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.837
Fine. I-I will call Colin,

16:27.837 --> 16:29.628
and try and smooth
things over for you,

16:29.628 --> 16:31.336
but you need
to handle Deedee.

16:31.336 --> 16:33.712
Okay, apologize
for outing him, of course,

16:33.712 --> 16:36.545
but you need to make sure
he keeps quiet about this.

16:36.545 --> 16:38.586
Alright, 'cause it's not just
about losing K-Hole,

16:38.586 --> 16:39.962
it's way worse than that.

16:39.962 --> 16:41.211
Let's put it this way.

16:41.211 --> 16:43.211
Would you want to go
from being a rock band

16:43.211 --> 16:46.795
to being...
a Christian rock band?

16:47.962 --> 16:49.336
Oh, shit.

16:49.336 --> 16:52.378
"The bear is sticky
with honey."

16:52.378 --> 16:54.545
Those were
his exact words.

16:54.545 --> 16:55.753
But what does that mean?

16:55.753 --> 16:57.461
Well, Gavin speaks
in parables.

16:57.461 --> 17:00.128
I think what
Gavin is saying is...

17:00.128 --> 17:01.670
"consider the bear."

17:01.670 --> 17:04.336
And all this pizazz
is like the honey.

17:04.336 --> 17:06.378
And it's become too sticky.

17:06.378 --> 17:07.795
There's too much of it.
It's all over him.

17:07.795 --> 17:10.712
Incorrect. No, see,
the whole launch
is the bear,

17:10.712 --> 17:12.461
and the honey is the pizazz.

17:12.461 --> 17:14.211
The bear needs more pizazz.

17:14.211 --> 17:16.878
The bear is ravenous
for pizazz.

17:16.878 --> 17:18.211
You don't speak for Gavin.

17:18.211 --> 17:20.753
I don't need to.
This is the word of Gavin.

17:20.753 --> 17:22.545
Alright, forget it.

17:22.545 --> 17:24.253
You do it your way,
I'll do it mine.
Okay, fine.

17:24.253 --> 17:27.128
Gonna show you.
Make it clear for all of you.
Okay, follow me.

17:27.128 --> 17:29.670
Jared:
Well, congratulations
on becoming

17:29.670 --> 17:31.837
Pied Piper's official
towing company.

17:31.837 --> 17:33.503
Uh-huh, yeah, great.

17:33.503 --> 17:34.628
So should I bill this to you,

17:34.628 --> 17:37.044
or is Mr. Bighetti
gonna take care of it?

17:37.044 --> 17:39.878
"Bighetti"?
It's registered
under his name.

17:39.878 --> 17:41.211
I'm sorry. Can I...?

17:43.336 --> 17:47.003
♪ ♪

17:47.003 --> 17:49.003
Richard:
Anyway, it was a mistake.

17:49.003 --> 17:50.336
I'm sorry I outed you.

17:50.336 --> 17:51.962
I just wish we could
go back to normal.

17:51.962 --> 17:54.336
You know, just like,
how things were.

17:54.336 --> 17:55.753
A CEO and a gay CEO.

17:55.753 --> 17:57.670
I don't even know what
normal is anymore, Richard.

17:57.670 --> 17:59.795
It's been such
a crazy 24 hours,
you know?

17:59.795 --> 18:02.420
Gossip travels
so fast in the Valley.

18:02.420 --> 18:04.503
I'll be lucky if my parents
ever talk to me again.

18:04.503 --> 18:06.044
Your parents
aren't Christian?

18:06.044 --> 18:07.294
I'm from Palo Alto.

18:07.294 --> 18:10.294
You know, my dad says
my lifestyle makes him sick.

18:10.294 --> 18:11.795
He just wants
his gay son back.

18:11.795 --> 18:13.920
And he's okay
with the gay part?

18:13.920 --> 18:15.545
He's gay.
Oh.

18:15.545 --> 18:16.878
But the crazy part is,

18:16.878 --> 18:19.670

to thank for it.

it could be more gay.

this is great,

gay and a Christian.
