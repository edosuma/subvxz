00:27.920 --> 00:29.550
I don't know about you,

00:29.600 --> 00:32.270
but to me there's something
a bit funny about tortoises.

00:32.320 --> 00:34.830
The way even
the teenagers are wrinkly.

00:34.880 --> 00:37.230
I bet that leads to some
awkward moments.

00:37.280 --> 00:39.750
"Oh, Brian, I love you so much.
How old are you?"

00:39.800 --> 00:42.270
"I'm 17. How old are you, Janet?"

00:42.320 --> 00:46.110
"I'm 86." "Goodness me. You're old
enough to be my grandmother."

00:46.160 --> 00:47.550
"Yeah, actually, Brian,

00:47.600 --> 00:49.670
~ "I ~ AM ~ your grandmother."

00:49.720 --> 00:51.630
But the story I want to tell you,

00:51.680 --> 00:55.230
although it does involve tortoises,
it doesn't begin with a tortoise.

00:55.280 --> 00:58.470
It begins with a man
called Mr Hoppy.

00:58.520 --> 01:01.470
'Mr Hoppy, the hero of our story,

01:01.520 --> 01:06.230
'lived in a nice flat
in an apartment block in London.

01:06.280 --> 01:09.870
'There are three things
you should know about Mr Hoppy.

01:09.920 --> 01:11.750
'He's kind...

01:11.800 --> 01:13.830
'he's shy...

01:13.880 --> 01:17.270
'and most importantly -
he's not that guy in the hat.'

01:17.320 --> 01:19.870
Oh, are you OK,
Mr Mavrokoukoudopolous?

01:19.920 --> 01:21.430
'He's the man in the lift.'

01:21.480 --> 01:25.600
No rush, Mr Mavrokoukoudopolous.
I'm holding the door.

01:27.680 --> 01:29.510
~ Take your ti...
~ Whoa!

01:29.560 --> 01:30.600
Ah!

01:42.160 --> 01:44.230
You care for a crisp, Mr Pringle?

01:44.280 --> 01:46.480
Ah, yes.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.190
Lovely.

01:51.240 --> 01:54.110
'And don't worry if he doesn't look
the flashiest of fellows.

01:54.160 --> 01:56.190
'I've learnt
that very often in life,

01:56.240 --> 01:57.830
'it's the quiet, unassuming ones

01:57.880 --> 02:00.240
'who turn out to be
the most interesting.'

02:11.000 --> 02:12.790
HE SIGHS

02:12.840 --> 02:14.240
I'll have to fix that.

The truth is there were
two loves in Mr Hoppy's life.

04:17.760 --> 04:19.269
One was his flowers

04:19.320 --> 04:22.350
and the other was a secret love
he kept all to himself.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.190
And like so many secrets,

04:24.240 --> 04:27.830
it was the most important thing
of all about him.

04:27.880 --> 04:30.590
Because Mr Hoppy was in love...

04:30.640 --> 04:32.320
with the girl downstairs.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.390
WOMAN: Good morning, Mr Hoppy.

04:39.440 --> 04:40.680
Ah.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.990
Mrs Silver.

04:45.040 --> 04:46.240
Hello.

04:49.320 --> 04:50.600
Hello.

04:53.160 --> 04:57.390
By the way, our story
is mainly concerned with this -

04:57.440 --> 04:58.750
the second love.

04:58.800 --> 05:02.110
If you want to find out about the
flowers, watch Gardeners' World.

05:02.160 --> 05:05.110
I mean, I like plants as much as the
next bloke, but this is very much

05:05.160 --> 05:08.790
not a "will or won't the dahlias
blossom before the frost kicks in?"

05:08.840 --> 05:09.950
type of thing.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.110
Oh, wait, I think that's mine. Hey!

05:12.160 --> 05:13.200
Hey!

05:16.640 --> 05:20.190
Another absolutely gorgeous morning.

05:20.240 --> 05:22.510
Yes. Gorgeous. Absolutely.

05:22.560 --> 05:24.030
Another one of them.

05:24.080 --> 05:26.670
The sort of weather that makes me
want to just

05:26.720 --> 05:30.070
take off all my clothes and
dive naked into the nearest lake.

05:30.120 --> 05:31.680
Don't you think, Mr Hoppy?

05:34.360 --> 05:35.670
~ Mr Hoppy? ~ Yes.

05:35.720 --> 05:37.390
Yes, yes.

05:37.440 --> 05:40.150
Perfect weather for jumping
into lakes

05:40.200 --> 05:42.190
wearing very little.

05:42.240 --> 05:44.990
'Sadly, Mr Hoppy was so shy,

05:45.040 --> 05:48.350
'he couldn't even ask Mrs Silver
round for a cup of tea...'

05:48.400 --> 05:51.120
let alone dive stark naked
into a lake with her.

05:53.640 --> 05:55.830
But he loved her.

05:55.880 --> 05:59.390
And he remembered the precise moment
he'd fallen in love.

05:59.440 --> 06:03.510
'Which happened to be
the first moment he ever met her -

06:03.560 --> 06:04.760
'five years ago.'

06:06.440 --> 06:07.960
Hold that lift!

06:10.040 --> 06:12.830
Oh, thank you so much,
you darling man.

06:12.880 --> 06:14.550
Oh, they won't be long.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.630
~ What floor are you?
~ Four.

06:16.680 --> 06:19.870
Oh, isn't that lucky?
I'm moving in on three, below you.

06:19.920 --> 06:22.270
I hope you're not
one of those rowdy types,

06:22.320 --> 06:24.790
keeping me up all night
with your hip-hop stylings.

06:24.840 --> 06:27.030
No. But my name is Mr Hoppy,
in fact.

06:27.080 --> 06:31.030
Hoppy. Oh, what a gorgeous name!

06:31.080 --> 06:33.710
And do I detect a little
American accent there?

06:33.760 --> 06:35.390
Well, yes, I am an American.

06:35.440 --> 06:38.190
Oh, how divine.
Oh, you're a gorgeous bunch.

06:38.240 --> 06:40.270
From Cary Grant to Paul Newman,

06:40.320 --> 06:42.750
I can't keep my hands
off the lot of you!

06:42.800 --> 06:47.110
Oh, I'm Mrs Silver. Lavinia.
Facebook status - widowed.

06:47.160 --> 06:50.870
Ah. My Facebook status is
"I'm not in the Facebook".

06:50.920 --> 06:52.550
No. Too busy living, I expect.

06:52.600 --> 06:54.800
Oh, come in, boys.
We've held the lift.

06:55.880 --> 06:57.040
Come in.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.910
Would it be easier
if I maybe took the next one,

07:01.960 --> 07:03.510
give you a little more room?

07:03.560 --> 07:05.440
No, no, it's just getting cosy!

07:10.760 --> 07:12.870
Wonderfully quiet lift.

07:12.920 --> 07:14.840
~ That's very good news. ~ Yes.

07:16.480 --> 07:19.270
I don't think anyone's
actually pushed a button yet.

07:19.320 --> 07:20.590
Oh!

07:20.640 --> 07:23.240
I'm such a silly sausage sometimes.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.550
Ooh!
SHE CHUCKLES

07:26.600 --> 07:28.670
You're four. I'm three.

07:28.720 --> 07:31.670
Perhaps I should press two
and one as well and give us

07:31.720 --> 07:33.550
more time to get to know each other.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.550
'He never forgot
that first brief encounter'

07:36.600 --> 07:38.870
and every time
he met her from then on

07:38.920 --> 07:41.990
just made him love her even more.
Summer.

ELEVATOR BELL DINGS

07:47.440 --> 07:51.000

07:53.040 --> 07:54.270
Autumn.

07:54.320 --> 07:55.440
Oh.

07:57.640 --> 08:00.750
Always such a relief
when summer's over.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.150
Mm.

08:02.200 --> 08:03.520
'Winter.'

08:05.040 --> 08:07.760
This is so much
my favourite time of year.

08:10.440 --> 08:11.680
Spring.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.590
Oh.

08:16.640 --> 08:18.120
Spring at last!

08:24.200 --> 08:26.830
Doing something special tonight,
Mrs Silver?

08:26.880 --> 08:30.230
Us midwives are going out
for a good old knees-up.

08:30.280 --> 08:33.470
Funny when you think of it -
when we spent our entire careers

08:33.520 --> 08:36.669
extracting babies from women
lying with their knees up.

08:36.720 --> 08:40.870
Oh... I...
I didn't know you were a midwife.

08:40.919 --> 08:42.110
Retired.

08:42.159 --> 08:44.550
I just thought
if I can't have kids myself,

08:44.600 --> 08:46.950
I might as well just help others
to have them.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.070
How wonderful.

08:49.120 --> 08:51.830
Well, perhaps you could come with me,
Mr Hoppy?

08:51.880 --> 08:54.630
~ You could waltz me off my feet.
~ Oh, no. I... I...

08:54.680 --> 08:57.230
~ I'm not a dancer.
~ Nonsense.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.750
There's no such thing
as "not a dancer" -

08:59.800 --> 09:03.670
just a person who's never found
the right girl to dance with.

09:03.720 --> 09:08.070
You're American, for heaven's sake -
the land that brought us

09:08.120 --> 09:10.630
Fred Astaire and John Travolta
and...

09:10.680 --> 09:13.350
that naughty little
Justin Timberlake.

09:13.400 --> 09:14.790
I know you can dance.

09:14.840 --> 09:16.870
~ No, no, I can't.
~ Can!

09:16.920 --> 09:18.510
No, I can't.

09:18.560 --> 09:19.910
Can!

09:19.960 --> 09:21.510
No, I really can't.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.390
You bloody well can!

09:23.440 --> 09:25.640
SHE HUMS HAPPILY

09:27.320 --> 09:31.270
'He loved her and
longed for her to love him back

09:31.320 --> 09:34.270
'but there really were
a lot of problems.

09:34.320 --> 09:38.830
'For one thing, unlike Mr Hoppy,
Mrs Silver didn't live alone.

09:38.880 --> 09:43.590
'Well, she did for a while, but
then she did something about it.'

DOORBELL RINGS

09:45.120 --> 09:47.080

09:56.000 --> 10:00.310
This is honestly the most
exciting moment of my life.

10:00.360 --> 10:02.110
Come in. Come in!

10:02.160 --> 10:04.710
'She just went
and got herself a new chap.'

10:04.760 --> 10:06.750
A chap called Alfie.

10:06.800 --> 10:13.880
Well... you are more gorgeous than
I could possibly have dreamed.

10:17.160 --> 10:22.630
Oh, my darling. What heaven.

10:22.680 --> 10:25.840
We're going to have
such a wonderful life together.

10:30.480 --> 10:33.390
'From then on,
Mrs Silver dedicated all her love

10:33.440 --> 10:36.110
'and attention to her
wrinkly companion.

10:36.160 --> 10:39.550
'And although he wasn't the
world's greatest conversationalist,

10:39.600 --> 10:42.030
'she did quite enough talking
for the both of them.'

10:42.080 --> 10:45.630
Look, Alfie,
that's me on my wedding day.

10:45.680 --> 10:49.750
I'm not so sure about that dress
any longer.

10:49.800 --> 10:52.470
Rather too much bust, I think
you'll agree.

10:52.520 --> 10:53.710
SHE CHUCKLES

10:53.760 --> 10:56.840
Oh, and that chap there -
that's my husband.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.630
Look how tall he is. 6'3".

11:02.680 --> 11:05.550
I only came up to his chest hair.

11:05.600 --> 11:08.430
I never once saw
the top of his head.

11:08.480 --> 11:10.040
More a giant than a man.

11:11.960 --> 11:14.190
A wonderful posture.

11:14.240 --> 11:18.150
He was a perfect English gent...

11:18.200 --> 11:20.470
and a prize-winning dancer.

11:20.520 --> 11:22.560
Oh, he was so, so kind.

11:24.240 --> 11:26.870
The things we were going to do.
And the...

11:26.920 --> 11:29.360
places we were going to go
and the...

11:31.440 --> 11:33.480
.. life we were going to lead.

11:46.120 --> 11:51.110
Oh, that's enough of me gabbing on.
You must be exhausted.

11:51.160 --> 11:53.320
Time for your nap, my gorgeous.

12:00.080 --> 12:03.630
I love you so much. I really do.

12:03.680 --> 12:06.630
Even your little stubby legs.

12:06.680 --> 12:08.480
SHE CHUCKLES

12:11.280 --> 12:14.830
Our love will last a lifetime,
Alfie.

12:14.880 --> 12:16.870
Sweet dreams.

12:16.920 --> 12:20.470
'Oh, how Mr Hoppy wished
she was saying those words to him.'

12:20.520 --> 12:23.150
Not the ones about the little
stubby legs, obviously,

12:23.200 --> 12:25.470
but the others, about love.

12:25.520 --> 12:28.030
His life was now terribly
complicated -

12:28.080 --> 12:31.150
head over heels in love with
a woman whose only interest in life

12:31.200 --> 12:33.070
was a small tortoise.

12:33.120 --> 12:36.680
If only he could find the words
to convince her of his love.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.510
If only I'd been paying attention.
I think I'm on the wrong bus.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.270
That's the problem with stories.

12:43.320 --> 12:45.470
You get swept up in them,
you lose track.

12:45.520 --> 12:48.070
Does he get anywhere?
Does she fall in love with him?

12:48.120 --> 12:50.230
You're going to have to wait,
I'm afraid.

12:50.280 --> 12:51.350
PASSENGERS GROAN

12:51.400 --> 12:53.510
Mr Hoppy knew
he had to say something.

12:53.560 --> 12:56.040
He had to tell her how he felt.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.280
Hello.

13:01.320 --> 13:02.430
Again.

13:02.480 --> 13:05.070
Isn't this perfect?

13:05.120 --> 13:08.110
Grab joy while you can, I say.

13:08.160 --> 13:09.630
Oh...

13:09.680 --> 13:11.870
You're right, completely right.

13:11.920 --> 13:16.950
And I was... just thinking...

13:17.000 --> 13:19.230
wondering, uh...

13:19.280 --> 13:21.470
whether...

13:21.520 --> 13:24.950
And the thing of it is,
we've been neighbours for years.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.310
You live alone and I live alone...

13:27.360 --> 13:28.910
JAZZ PLAYS THROUGH HEADPHONES

13:28.960 --> 13:31.240
I just wondered whether...

13:32.600 --> 13:34.000
.. you know...

13:37.440 --> 13:39.990
Oh, no, you're...

13:40.040 --> 13:43.560
You're right, best,
best leave things as they are.

13:48.320 --> 13:49.830
On the contrary,

13:49.880 --> 13:52.030
I think you've got
a very good point.

13:52.080 --> 13:55.350
It's high time
we got to know each other.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.390
How about dinner tonight?

13:57.440 --> 13:59.630
~ That's very kind of...
~ Excellent.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.230
I'll pop round about six.

14:01.280 --> 14:04.560
Open-neck shirt, possibly, give you
a glimpse of the old tan, eh?

14:06.040 --> 14:07.880
HE CHUCKLES

14:13.320 --> 14:14.710
Yummy.

14:14.760 --> 14:19.270
So, Hoppy, it's wonderful
to have a chance to really,

14:19.320 --> 14:21.070
really get to know you.

14:21.120 --> 14:23.550
Find out about the man
behind the mask, as it were.

14:23.600 --> 14:24.750
Yes, well, I...

14:24.800 --> 14:27.510
It's so easy, in life,
to pass people in the lift

14:27.560 --> 14:30.750
and never really get to grips with
who they are, where they come from.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.270
~ That's so true.
~ So, tell me everything -

14:33.320 --> 14:36.510
where you were born, where
you grew up, what job you did,

14:36.560 --> 14:40.070
love, life, back problems -
the whole caboodle.

14:40.120 --> 14:42.990
~ Well, start at the beginning.
~ Well... ~ Born?

14:43.040 --> 14:44.470
Well, yes, I was born...

14:44.520 --> 14:46.230
Never match my story, I suspect.

14:46.280 --> 14:49.350
I was born in the back
of a Volkswagen Beetle

14:49.400 --> 14:50.710
on Waterloo Bridge.

14:50.760 --> 14:54.190
~ Oh. ~ Dad went over a speed bump
and out I plopped.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.190
Well, that's his story anyway.

14:56.240 --> 14:58.710
~ Oh, well, I-I-I...
~ It was downhill from there, really.

14:58.760 --> 15:00.550
Dad was in sausages,
we moved to Germany.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.830
I spent from two until eight

15:02.880 --> 15:06.430
feasting on frankfurters
und bratwurst,

15:06.480 --> 15:09.990
and then sent straight back here
to boarding school.

15:10.040 --> 15:11.320
You board?

15:12.480 --> 15:14.430
~ No, no...
~ Got used to it, though.

15:14.480 --> 15:17.070
Made a wonderful friend, Isherwood.

15:17.120 --> 15:19.070
Huge feet...

15:19.120 --> 15:20.590
tiny ears.

15:20.640 --> 15:21.870
Are you done?

15:21.920 --> 15:24.990
So there I was, assistant manager.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.430
Only 23.

15:26.480 --> 15:30.430
Still allergic to cats,
unfortunately, but...

15:30.480 --> 15:34.190
"You must be joking, Giles," I said,
and walked straight out,

15:34.240 --> 15:36.750
still in full Wonder Woman
costume...

15:36.800 --> 15:38.870
A whole octopus!

15:38.920 --> 15:40.840
HE CACKLES

15:42.960 --> 15:46.590
But that's enough about me -
what about you?

15:46.640 --> 15:47.910
BELLS TOLL

15:47.960 --> 15:51.230
~ Well, we may have to do me
next time. ~ Nonsense.

15:51.280 --> 15:54.750
What brought you to England?
The full story.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.240
OK. Ah.

15:57.880 --> 16:00.150
My parents brought me here
when I was ten...

16:00.200 --> 16:03.190
~ No, you're right. ~ Unfortunately...
~ It's too late.

16:03.240 --> 16:06.990
Let's do same time next month.

16:07.040 --> 16:08.480
It's all about you.

16:11.600 --> 16:14.950
But don't let me forget to tell you
about the Alsatian

16:15.000 --> 16:16.750
and my corduroy trousers.

16:16.800 --> 16:17.960
HE CHUCKLES

16:23.080 --> 16:26.240
Well. That's the way it goes,
I guess.

16:32.280 --> 16:35.920
'Mr Hoppy went to bed that night
feeling terribly alone.

16:37.360 --> 16:40.390
'Knowing in his bones
that he always would be alone.

16:40.440 --> 16:42.990
'No Mrs Silver for him.'

16:43.040 --> 16:44.030
Ow!

16:44.080 --> 16:46.110
'He couldn't help but wonder,

16:46.160 --> 16:48.750
'is this all there is?

16:48.800 --> 16:53.310
'Old age is scary and all downhill.'

16:53.360 --> 16:54.600
HE COUGHS

17:07.520 --> 17:11.470
But the very next morning,
a conversation occurred

17:11.520 --> 17:14.069
that changed Mr Hoppy's life.

17:14.119 --> 17:18.190
Good morning, Mrs Silver.
Alfie's looking well this morning.

17:18.240 --> 17:19.550
Likes his food.

17:19.599 --> 17:23.079
Yes. Well, we both live in hope.

17:24.440 --> 17:26.270
Oh.

17:26.319 --> 17:28.710
What are you both hoping for?

17:28.760 --> 17:31.350
Well, obviously,
that he'll grow a little faster.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.630
Every month I weigh him
on the kitchen scales,

17:33.680 --> 17:34.910
he never puts on an ounce.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.590
Well, no, I believe tortoises
come in different sizes.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.870
There's nothing wrong with Alfie
being one of the small ones.

17:40.920 --> 17:42.630
Oh, don't be silly.

17:42.680 --> 17:45.950
Just think how miserable it must
make him to feel so titchy.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.110
Mm.

17:47.160 --> 17:52.110
We've been stuck on 13oz
since the day he arrived.

17:52.160 --> 17:55.200
Didn't you want to be taller
when you were growing up?

17:56.320 --> 17:58.550
I guess I did.

17:58.600 --> 18:00.550
Yes.

18:00.600 --> 18:01.800
When...

18:03.040 --> 18:06.190
When I was a kid,
I used to wear thick socks to bed.

18:06.240 --> 18:09.390
~ What, to make yourself grow taller?
~ Right.

18:09.440 --> 18:11.830
I actually read that
"The warmer your feet,

18:11.880 --> 18:14.030
"the deeper you sleep,
the more you grow."

18:14.080 --> 18:17.310
~ SHE CHUCKLES
~ But sadly, all I got was...

18:17.360 --> 18:18.800
stinky feet.

18:21.040 --> 18:24.270
Oh, no... Well, I was tiny too.

18:24.320 --> 18:25.550
Oh.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.910
And then when I was 11,
a boy in my class told me

18:27.960 --> 18:29.670
that kissing made you grow taller.

18:29.720 --> 18:31.030
~ No! ~ Yes.

18:31.080 --> 18:33.680
So I paid him sixpence every day
to kiss me.

18:35.040 --> 18:37.150
Well, you have to hand it to him.

18:37.200 --> 18:40.590
And I did hand it to him.
On a plate.

18:40.640 --> 18:42.240
Every morning at break.

18:43.640 --> 18:47.790
~ Mind you, it did make me FEEL taller.

18:47.840 --> 18:50.600
A kiss does that,
don't you think, Mr Hoppy?

18:52.360 --> 18:55.550
I believe it does.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.310
Oh, no.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.670
Size is very important.

18:59.720 --> 19:03.960
And Alfie's just at the beginning
of his size journey.

19:10.200 --> 19:13.470
'That was the seed
that planted the idea.'

19:13.520 --> 19:17.430
And the next day, it got a proper,
full-scale watering.

19:17.480 --> 19:19.950
Alfie any bigger today, Mrs S?

19:20.000 --> 19:21.160
Not a jot.

19:22.520 --> 19:25.560
But I am knitting him
some little socks, just in case.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.750
But I'm not giving up.

19:28.800 --> 19:32.310
One day, I'll find the right food,
and the right exercise regime,

19:32.360 --> 19:34.150
and the right vitamin supplement,

19:34.200 --> 19:36.230
probably something to do
with fish oil.

19:36.280 --> 19:39.030
Then at last we'll both be happy,
won't we, darling?

19:39.080 --> 19:44.990
So, you don't think you'll ever
be totally happy until he grows?

19:45.040 --> 19:47.630
I'm afraid not, Mr Hoppy.

19:47.680 --> 19:51.590
Come on, pipsqueak,
finish your strawberry.

19:51.640 --> 19:55.590
'And that night, the seed
that had been watered blossomed.

19:55.640 --> 19:59.750
'And in Mr Hoppy's brain flowered
a plan to make Mrs Silver happy.

19:59.800 --> 20:03.790
'And he thought if he could make
her happy then maybe, just maybe,

20:03.840 --> 20:06.480
'he might be worthy
of winning her heart.'

20:11.320 --> 20:14.360
HE MUMBLES

20:18.320 --> 20:19.720
Esio Trot.

20:42.080 --> 20:43.600
HE SIGHS

20:58.960 --> 21:00.640
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

21:02.800 --> 21:04.390
Mrs Silver.

21:04.440 --> 21:05.710
Oh, yes?

21:05.760 --> 21:07.750
I think I may just be able
to help with the

21:07.800 --> 21:09.510
Alfie-being-disappointedly-tiny

21:09.560 --> 21:11.390
month-after-month thing.

21:11.440 --> 21:13.110
Oh, Mr Hoppy.

21:13.160 --> 21:15.830
If only you could, I would love
you for the rest of my days.

21:15.880 --> 21:19.150
Oh. That'd be very nice.

21:19.200 --> 21:24.390
The thing is, last night,
I suddenly remembered a conversation

21:24.440 --> 21:26.750
I once had with a friend
at the airline

21:26.800 --> 21:28.510
who'd been a pilot in North Africa

21:28.560 --> 21:33.670
and he told me a conversation that
he once had with a Bedouin tribesman

21:33.720 --> 21:39.070
who told him an extraordinary
tortoise-size-related secret.

21:39.120 --> 21:41.710
~ Really?
~ Yes.

21:41.760 --> 21:44.110
Oh, tell me! I beg you, Mr Hoppy.

21:44.160 --> 21:45.280
Mrs Silver...

21:48.920 --> 21:53.590
.. I am going to lower this...

21:53.640 --> 21:55.040
this piece of paper.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.950
And, by the way, you were right.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.670
Alfie can get bigger. But...

22:02.720 --> 22:04.150
you must read this.

22:04.200 --> 22:07.030
How exciting! What is it?

22:07.080 --> 22:09.990
It's a Bedouin tortoise chant.

22:10.040 --> 22:11.280
Oh, good lord.

22:14.920 --> 22:20.390
"Esio Trot, Esio Trot...

22:20.440 --> 22:23.830
"teg reggib reggib..."

22:23.880 --> 22:26.670
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr Hoppy,

22:26.720 --> 22:29.430
I don't understand.
Is this in another language?

22:29.480 --> 22:30.910
Yes and no.

22:30.960 --> 22:33.880
Now, according to the Bedouin...

22:35.680 --> 22:38.550
.. tortoises are very
backwards creatures.

22:38.600 --> 22:42.230
So, therefore it's logical that
they would only understand words

22:42.280 --> 22:44.630
that are spoken backwards, you see.

22:44.680 --> 22:48.350
Oh, I see. So "Esio Trot"
is "tortoise" backwards.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.750
~ Yes. ~ Oh! Oh, yes.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.990
"Esio Trot, Esio Trot..." Yes.

22:53.040 --> 22:57.030
"Emoc no, Esio Trot.

22:57.080 --> 22:59.110
"Worg pu...

22:59.160 --> 23:02.590
HE MOUTHS
".. ffup pu, toohs pu."

23:02.640 --> 23:04.350
There's a lot of "pu's" in it.

23:04.400 --> 23:08.430
Yes. Yes. Yes. Pu is a
very powerful word in any language.

23:08.480 --> 23:12.390
Are you having me on, Mr Hoppy?
Is this serious?

23:12.440 --> 23:16.070
Mrs Silver, I have never been
more serious in my life.

23:16.120 --> 23:19.950
Well... I suppose it could be true.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.510
The world's full of wonders.

23:21.560 --> 23:25.710
I once heard that a cockroach can
live for two weeks without a head.

23:25.760 --> 23:27.590
~ Is that right? ~ Well, apparently.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.390
And bats always turn left

23:29.440 --> 23:31.870
~ when they leave the cave.
~ Yes, I heard that.

23:31.920 --> 23:33.670
And dolphins understand French.

23:33.720 --> 23:37.350
~ Really?
~ So, I suppose this could work.

23:37.400 --> 23:42.110
What this is really saying is
"Tortoise, tortoise,

23:42.160 --> 23:44.110
"get bigger, bigger."

23:44.160 --> 23:45.910
Er...

23:45.960 --> 23:47.950
"Grow up, puff up, shoot up" -

23:48.000 --> 23:49.670
not what they mean these days.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.110
Oh, that's a relief.

23:51.160 --> 23:54.070
"Spring up", "blow up"...

23:54.120 --> 23:56.070
Again, not the violent version.

23:56.120 --> 23:57.830
"Swell up."

23:57.880 --> 23:59.400
Um, er...

24:00.720 --> 24:05.550
BOTH: "Gorge, guzzle, stuff, gulp.

24:05.600 --> 24:08.350
"Put on fat, tortoise, put on fat.

24:08.400 --> 24:10.910
"Get on! Get on!

24:10.960 --> 24:12.510
"Gobble food."

24:12.560 --> 24:13.550
That's it.

24:13.600 --> 24:15.190
SHE GASPS

24:15.240 --> 24:16.950
And if my memory serves me correct,

24:17.000 --> 24:20.110
my friend told me that all you have
to do is pick up little Alfie

24:20.160 --> 24:22.790
right up to your face
and say it three times a day,

24:22.840 --> 24:23.990
morning, noon and night.

24:24.040 --> 24:26.160
~ And if you do it...
~ What time at night?

24:27.520 --> 24:28.870
Before dinner.

24:28.920 --> 24:31.390
~ And if you do it properly...
~ His dinner or my dinner?

24:31.440 --> 24:33.350
~ Does it matter?
~ Well, you tell me.

24:33.400 --> 24:36.950
~ You're the one with all
the inside Bedouin knowledge. ~ Yes.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.630
Quite right.
Before your dinner.

24:39.680 --> 24:42.990
And I'm betting
that by the end of the month,

24:43.040 --> 24:45.470
he'll be twice the size he is now.

24:45.520 --> 24:48.150
And that's a conservative estimate,
Mrs Silver.

24:48.200 --> 24:52.310
Well, goodness. I can't believe it.

24:52.360 --> 24:55.430
But if it works, oh, Mr H,

24:55.480 --> 24:58.150
I'll never be able
to thank you enough.

24:58.200 --> 25:02.390
You'll be the marvellous man
who made all my dreams come true.

25:02.440 --> 25:04.720
Well, wouldn't that be wonderful?

25:07.280 --> 25:09.510
"Esio Trot, Esio Trot..."

25:09.560 --> 25:13.070
'Suddenly, for the first time ever,

25:13.120 --> 25:16.950
'the happiness of two human beings
rested entirely

25:17.000 --> 25:22.230
'on the possibility of a small
tortoise becoming a big tortoise.'

25:22.280 --> 25:25.950
Which, of course, was
a very serious issue indeed

25:26.000 --> 25:29.230
because what Mr Hoppy had devised
here was no simple thing.

25:29.280 --> 25:32.390
It was,
and I won't mince my words here,

25:32.440 --> 25:37.030
the greatest and most complicated
plan in the long and noble history

25:37.080 --> 25:39.640
of tortoise-based tale-telling.

25:45.480 --> 25:48.870
I have 16 tortoises for sale.
From small to large to enormous.

25:48.920 --> 25:51.590
Each one comes
with its own certificate,

25:51.640 --> 25:55.230
and you should know I do not sell
any animal without first

25:55.280 --> 25:59.510
assuring myself that it's going
to a good, caring home.

25:59.560 --> 26:02.950
~ How many do you want?
~ I'll take all 16.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.270
I'll bag 'em up.

26:04.320 --> 26:06.350
I don't really need
the enormous ones...

26:06.400 --> 26:08.320
I'll chuck 'em in for free anyway.

26:09.680 --> 26:12.880
All the big money is in
guinea pigs these days.

26:45.080 --> 26:49.080
~ I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
~ That's all right.

27:03.200 --> 27:05.950
~ I don't actually have any tortoises.
~ OK.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.230
But I've got a lovely iguana
out back. You want to see it?

27:09.280 --> 27:11.030
It's tempting, but no.

27:11.080 --> 27:13.990
Or I've got a weasel going
very cheap-cheap cheap-cheap.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.390
I just need tortoises.

27:15.440 --> 27:17.510
I've got a snake -
I could chop it in half

27:17.560 --> 27:20.430
~ and put a seashell on its back.
~ It's lovely meeting you.

27:20.480 --> 27:24.510
Or I could shave a hedgehog.
No-one would ever know.

27:24.560 --> 27:25.800
I've done it before.

27:56.480 --> 27:57.960
That's probably enough.

28:00.880 --> 28:03.150
Oh, no! Go back.

28:03.200 --> 28:05.520
Go back. Go back.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.430
I really must fix that.

28:09.480 --> 28:13.030
FROM OUTSIDE:
'"Esio Trot, Esio Trot,'

28:13.080 --> 28:15.160
"teg reggib, reggib.

28:17.000 --> 28:22.110

28:26.520 --> 28:30.400
Well, thank goodness I'm not asking
you to sip up anything.

28:32.360 --> 28:34.110
All right, darling,

28:34.160 --> 28:37.320
I'm just popping out to get you
some delicious cabbage.

28:43.400 --> 28:45.000
I'll be back in half an hour.

29:00.320 --> 29:02.000
Action time.

29:07.080 --> 29:08.600
OK.

29:09.880 --> 29:11.440
No - too heavy.

29:15.360 --> 29:16.640
Too light.

29:20.280 --> 29:23.200
Just perfect.
2oz more than Alfie.

29:24.800 --> 29:28.560
You, sir, are the chosen one.

29:37.600 --> 29:40.030
No! Or you're going back
to the pet shop.

29:40.080 --> 29:41.240
Stay there.

29:49.960 --> 29:51.800
OK, team...

29:53.520 --> 29:54.880
.. this is it.

30:13.160 --> 30:14.950
You can do this.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.520
You can do this.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.520
You can't do this.

30:22.360 --> 30:23.800
I can't do this.

30:29.040 --> 30:30.880
(Hang in there, Alfie 2.)

30:34.920 --> 30:36.400
HE SIGHS

30:42.000 --> 30:44.240
HE BREATHES NERVOUSLY

30:53.520 --> 30:55.200
CREAKING

31:14.360 --> 31:15.480
Ah!

31:20.640 --> 31:22.040
HE GROANS

31:24.480 --> 31:25.800
HE SCREAMS

31:31.160 --> 31:32.400
Good afternoon.

31:34.320 --> 31:35.760
Sorry to bother you.

31:38.120 --> 31:41.870
My name is Mr Hoppy and I...

31:41.920 --> 31:44.270
I live a couple of floors up.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.870
Mummy says I mustn't talk
to strangers.

31:46.920 --> 31:49.630
No. Quite right. Well done, Mum.

31:49.680 --> 31:52.390
Are you about to offer me sweets
and then kidnap me?

31:52.440 --> 31:54.830
No, I'm not.

31:54.880 --> 31:56.710
That's a relief.

31:56.760 --> 32:00.790
But, as I said, I do...

32:00.840 --> 32:03.550
actually live in this building.

32:03.600 --> 32:05.030
I've never seen you.

32:05.080 --> 32:06.120
Well...

32:07.400 --> 32:09.630
.. I sort of keep myself to myself.

32:09.680 --> 32:11.430
Weirdos always do.

32:11.480 --> 32:16.070
Well, be that as it may,
do you think you could be a good boy

32:16.120 --> 32:19.990
and get your mummy to help me
onto your balcony?

32:20.040 --> 32:23.000
Why would I do that?
That would be a crazy thing to do.

32:30.040 --> 32:31.710
Mummy, Mummy, come and look.

32:31.760 --> 32:33.870
No, Philip.
I will not come and look.

32:33.920 --> 32:36.670
~ A nasty dwarf is NOT trying
to climb onto our balcony.

32:36.720 --> 32:40.080
~ But, Mummy! ~ No more scary movies
for you, young man.

32:43.760 --> 32:46.310
~ Mummy!
~ Philip, darling, I'm doing dinner.

32:46.360 --> 32:50.590
So Mr Hoppy decided
to abandon Plan A - the ladder.

32:50.640 --> 32:53.470
But, happily, he knew the
fundamental rule of life was that

32:53.520 --> 32:56.550
if Plan A fails,
Plan B will usually succeed.

32:56.600 --> 33:01.230
And if Plan B doesn't add up,
then Plan C always works every time.

33:01.280 --> 33:04.840
The only tiny problem was
he didn't have a Plan B...

33:06.160 --> 33:07.720
.. or a Plan C.

33:10.440 --> 33:12.480
'So, where did this leave Mr Hoppy?

33:16.360 --> 33:20.030
'Was he out for the count?
Done for? Doomed?

33:20.080 --> 33:23.360
'Was he going to give up?
Admit defeat?'

33:31.600 --> 33:32.910
Wait a minute.

33:32.960 --> 33:34.350
Of course he wasn't!

33:34.400 --> 33:36.670
This is Mr Hoppy
we're talking about.

33:36.720 --> 33:39.440
The Hopster!
The Hippity Hop Meister!

33:42.440 --> 33:44.910
He had a plan - Plan D.

33:44.960 --> 33:46.200
Let's go.

34:52.800 --> 34:55.270
~ Oh!
~ Oh! Hello, Mr Hoppy.

34:55.320 --> 34:56.429
Hello.

34:56.480 --> 34:58.950
Good lord. What have you got there?

34:59.000 --> 35:00.510
Oh, er...

35:00.560 --> 35:04.510
It looks like a huge fishing rod
for catching jellyfish or something.

35:04.560 --> 35:08.190
Yes, it is a huge fishing rod
for catching jellyfish.

35:08.240 --> 35:10.950
What on Earth do you want that for?

35:11.000 --> 35:14.790
Well, that's a very good question.
But, er...

35:14.840 --> 35:16.760
the answer's pretty simple.

35:18.640 --> 35:21.190
All my life
I wanted to catch a jellyfish.

35:21.240 --> 35:23.310
I got bitten by one...

35:23.360 --> 35:25.910
and I wanted to seek my revenge,

35:25.960 --> 35:30.110
so I thought the time had come
to get a huge fishing rod

35:30.160 --> 35:35.190
and do just that -
catch a... huge jellyfish.

35:35.240 --> 35:38.070
Well! What a thing!

35:38.120 --> 35:40.030

35:49.600 --> 35:52.230
very nice, Mrs Silver.
Where are you off to?

35:52.280 --> 35:54.910
A dance marathon,
at the community centre.

35:54.960 --> 35:56.990
For charity. You know?

35:57.040 --> 35:58.910
Chi-Chi-Chi!

35:58.960 --> 36:01.120
We're hoping for a lot of sponsors.

36:03.560 --> 36:06.110
Well... it's for charity.

36:06.160 --> 36:08.110
Oh...

36:08.160 --> 36:10.710
Oh, maybe I could be a sponsor too.

36:10.760 --> 36:13.310
~ Well, that would be wonderful!
~ Yes, why not?

36:13.360 --> 36:16.190
Put me, erm... down for a pound.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.110
A pound? Oh!

36:18.160 --> 36:19.280
Right, lovely.

36:20.480 --> 36:22.600
Er... No, that's... very kind.

36:23.680 --> 36:26.350
By which I mean...

36:26.400 --> 36:28.320
a pound a minute, of course.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.470
~ A pound a minute?! ~ Yes.

36:32.520 --> 36:34.750
~ That's incredible! ~ Is it?

36:34.800 --> 36:37.870
~ Oh, yes. Most people sponsor
by the hour. ~ They do?

36:37.920 --> 36:42.070
Well, yes, because it's a marathon.
I mean, a pound a minute?!

36:42.120 --> 36:43.510
That's marvellous!

36:43.560 --> 36:46.550
~ A marathon.
~ Oh, it's really inspired me.

36:46.600 --> 36:49.790
~ Oh. ~ Ooh! A pound a minute? ~ Yes.

36:49.840 --> 36:53.600

If I could have been anyone
in the history of the world,

41:14.960 --> 41:18.150
I wouldn't have been Julius Caesar
or Leonardo Da Vinci,

It's just like the first day
of school.

should really be worried.

Mr Hoppy's secret plan
was a cunning one. See,

If a creature grows slowly enough,
you'll never notice it grows at all.

45:03.600 --> 45:06.790

if it happened all at once.

45:06.840 --> 45:08.790
Let's say you had a small puppy.

45:08.840 --> 45:11.110
You drop it off at school
in the morning

45:11.160 --> 45:13.790
and pat its little head goodbye.

45:13.840 --> 45:15.400
~ Bye. ~ Bye-bye.

45:34.920 --> 45:37.950
I was telling them about Mr Hoppy.
I got carried away.

45:38.000 --> 45:41.320
Where have you got to?
Have you got to the death scene yet?

45:42.880 --> 45:44.150
Sorry!

45:44.200 --> 45:47.110
So, Mr Hoppy had completed
his first tortoise swap.

45:47.160 --> 45:50.030
Now all he had to do was keep
swapping every couple of days

45:50.080 --> 45:54.750
until Alfie doubled in size,
whilst living with 100 tortoises.

MRS SILVER CHATTERS INDISTINCTLY

48:19.800 --> 48:23.630
~ I so thought he was dead!
~ I know. ~ The first time I heard it.

48:23.680 --> 48:25.030
I know.

48:25.080 --> 48:26.720
Alfie!

48:28.400 --> 48:29.480
Alfie?

48:30.960 --> 48:32.240
Alfie?

48:36.440 --> 48:38.150
Alfie?

48:38.200 --> 48:42.550
Mummy, Mummy!
A tortoise just fell out of the sky!

48:42.600 --> 48:45.470
Yah! I hear so many things!

48:45.520 --> 48:47.230
So many things...

48:47.280 --> 48:49.120
Alfie?

48:50.560 --> 48:52.320
Oh! Mr Hoppy...

48:53.640 --> 48:55.430
Mr Hoppy?

48:55.480 --> 48:56.790
Yes.

48:56.840 --> 49:00.480
~ I'm here. ~ I don't know what's
happened, but... Alfie's gone.

49:01.600 --> 49:02.950
Gone?

49:03.000 --> 49:04.870
I think he's jumped.

49:04.920 --> 49:06.270
Oh, my darling!

49:06.320 --> 49:09.430
Oh, he's always had
very powerful legs!

49:09.480 --> 49:12.590
I think he's just bounced
himself over the edge!

49:12.640 --> 49:15.070
~ Oh! ~ Oh! I can't bear to look!

49:15.120 --> 49:17.430
Don't! Please, don't!

49:17.480 --> 49:20.550
Maybe he's gone back into the flat.

49:20.600 --> 49:22.550
I don't... Well...

49:22.600 --> 49:25.640
~ Yeah, I'll check that first.
~ OK. ~ Alfie!

49:26.920 --> 49:29.710
OK, OK, OK...

49:29.760 --> 49:33.950
Put Alfie 8 back on the balcony
and then go get Alfie 9.

49:34.000 --> 49:35.430
What's left of him.

49:35.480 --> 49:38.440
I know. I know...

49:42.040 --> 49:43.240
Oh!

50:04.960 --> 50:07.840
Better luck for you, Alfie 8.
There you go.

50:23.280 --> 50:24.630
Oh!

50:24.680 --> 50:26.040
Oh, Alfie!

50:38.920 --> 50:40.990
I've looked everywhere!

50:41.040 --> 50:43.070
I... Oh!

50:43.120 --> 50:45.270
Alfie!

50:45.320 --> 50:46.830
There you are!

50:46.880 --> 50:52.070
Oh, my holy aunt! You frightened
the living daylights out of me.

50:52.120 --> 50:54.470
Oh! Oh!

50:54.520 --> 50:57.830
Oh, dab, dab Esio Trot.

50:57.880 --> 50:59.120
Oh!

51:00.120 --> 51:02.470
Oh, it's all right, Mr Hoppy.

51:02.520 --> 51:04.190
I've found him.

51:04.240 --> 51:06.510
All's well.

51:06.560 --> 51:08.830
Thank the living Lord!

51:08.880 --> 51:10.270
Evening, Hoppy.

51:10.320 --> 51:12.950
Oh, good evening, Mr Pringle.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.800
And... what a...

51:17.280 --> 51:20.800
~ .. relaxing evening it is.
~ Yes, indeed.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.190
~ Are you cooking anything special?
~ No, I don't think so.

51:26.240 --> 51:29.390
Just something out of the fridge...
Frozen chicken pie...

51:29.440 --> 51:32.070
Sounds good to me. Love a pie.

51:32.120 --> 51:34.190
Love chicken.

51:34.240 --> 51:36.590
LOVE chicken pie!

51:36.640 --> 51:38.760
~ Oh. ~ You haven't forgotten?

51:40.520 --> 51:43.870
~ Forgotten? ~ Did I hear someone
mention chicken pie?

51:43.920 --> 51:45.550
You certainly did, Mrs Silver.

51:45.600 --> 51:48.710
We're having chicken pie,
round at Hoppy's tonight.

51:48.760 --> 51:50.070
Join us.

51:50.120 --> 51:53.150
~ Oh! Oh, no. I couldn't possibly.
~ Course you can!

51:53.200 --> 51:55.790
~ You don't mind, do you, Hoppy?
~ Mind, wha... ~ Excellent!

51:55.840 --> 51:58.750
My motto - two's company,
three's a party!

51:58.800 --> 52:03.550
~ Are you sure, Mr Hoppy? ~ No...
Yes. Oh, no problem.

52:03.600 --> 52:06.710
It'll be wonderful to have
you come around, Mrs Silver.

52:06.760 --> 52:09.200
Oh! Oh!

52:10.280 --> 52:11.720
Oh!

52:17.320 --> 52:19.270
Oh, no.

52:19.320 --> 52:22.440
No! Guys! Guys, I need your help!

52:23.840 --> 52:25.800
~ Nngg!
~ DOORBELL

52:29.640 --> 52:31.150
Oh.

52:31.200 --> 52:34.910
~ You look gorgeous, Mrs Silver.
~ Oh, thank you, Mr Pringle.

52:34.960 --> 52:37.400
~ Lawrence, please. ~ Lavinia.

52:39.440 --> 52:42.910
~ DOORBELL
~ Come on, Hoppy!

52:42.960 --> 52:44.280
Oh, look...

52:47.160 --> 52:48.510
Come in!

52:48.560 --> 52:49.950
Come on in.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.360
~ Oh, thank you. ~ You're welcome.

52:56.640 --> 52:59.550
Oh! What a lovely big room!

52:59.600 --> 53:04.270
~ Oh, I love that look
you've gone for. ~ Mm.

53:04.320 --> 53:07.550
~ What's it called? ~ Erm... ~ Prison cell.

53:07.600 --> 53:11.910
~ No, minimalist. Yes, that's it. Oh!
It's very stylish! ~ Thank you.

53:11.960 --> 53:15.360
Can I get you a drink? Er...
I have wine and...

53:16.720 --> 53:20.430
~ Well, wine. ~ A glass of white wine
would be perfect.

53:20.480 --> 53:24.950
~ Er... I... ~ Although, red's my real
favourite. I love lovely red.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.110
So glamorous.

53:27.160 --> 53:28.390
Thank you.

53:28.440 --> 53:31.030
I'm a little short on glasses today.

53:31.080 --> 53:33.990
~ Mrs Silver... ~ Thank you.

53:34.040 --> 53:36.240
And Mr Pringle. I'll have...

53:37.560 --> 53:38.640
.. this.

53:41.360 --> 53:43.360
Well... Serve yourselves.

53:45.480 --> 53:46.870
Er...

53:46.920 --> 53:49.990
I have to just get back
to the, er...

53:50.040 --> 53:52.590
~ Get back to... ~ Chin-chin!

53:52.640 --> 53:55.040
..cooking. Excuse me.

53:56.760 --> 53:58.360
(Excuse me.)

54:01.280 --> 54:05.190
You're doing great, guys.
Just try to keep the noise down.

54:05.240 --> 54:06.480
Easy.

54:11.240 --> 54:12.680
Ah!

54:19.640 --> 54:21.070
Dolly, it's hot.

54:21.120 --> 54:23.520
Potatoes. Got to put them
up to high.

54:26.240 --> 54:29.520
Spartacus, sorry,
but I really need the fridge now.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.430
~ Can I give you a hand in there? ~ No...

54:38.480 --> 54:41.350
~ We're feeling very guilty out here.
~ No, no.

54:41.400 --> 54:44.430
No, thank you.
I... I'm a very private cook.

54:44.480 --> 54:46.390
My recipe's a secret, Mrs Silver.

54:46.440 --> 54:49.590
Oh, and Mr Pringle's very keen
to know what vegetable we're having.

54:49.640 --> 54:52.590
Apparently, he enjoyed your carrots
enormously last time.

54:52.640 --> 54:56.030
~ Yes, tell him it's peas.
I hope that's all right. ~ Oh, peas!

54:56.080 --> 55:00.400
~ My favourite! ~ Peas are about the only
vegetable that I... I... really like.

55:04.200 --> 55:08.070
Apart from cabbages, of course.
Can't get enough of cabbage.

55:08.120 --> 55:11.600
Hope you don't mind, but I've been
tucking in to your nibbles.

55:12.800 --> 55:15.160
~ Nibbles? ~ Mm. Balti mix, is it?

55:18.160 --> 55:19.790
Mm!

55:19.840 --> 55:21.510
Peppery.

55:21.560 --> 55:23.870
Would you like some, Lavinia?

55:23.920 --> 55:25.350
Oh...

55:25.400 --> 55:28.120
~ No, thank you.
Not one of my favourites. ~ Oh.

55:29.400 --> 55:30.840
I've got to get the food.

55:42.560 --> 55:43.840
Sorry, Paul.

55:46.040 --> 55:49.270
~ A little more?
~ Oh, thank you. ~ Here we go!

55:49.320 --> 55:51.990
Fresh out of the oven. One pie
for you...

55:52.040 --> 55:54.070
Oh! That looks yummy!

55:54.120 --> 55:55.720
Oh, forgot the garnish.

56:02.360 --> 56:03.680
How did that happen?

56:06.960 --> 56:10.030
Oh, how magnificent!

56:10.080 --> 56:12.230
A pie to die for!

56:12.280 --> 56:16.910
Right, Lavinia.
I want to hear all about you.

56:16.960 --> 56:18.880
Every single little thing.

56:20.520 --> 56:22.190
Where were you born?

56:22.240 --> 56:25.310
~ I... ~ I was actually born
on the Thames myself.

56:25.360 --> 56:28.110
In the back of a Volkswagen Beetle.

56:28.160 --> 56:31.310
Dad went over a speed bump
and out I popped.

56:31.360 --> 56:35.710
So I said, "That's certainly
an original use for an octopus!"

56:35.760 --> 56:38.030
HE LAUGHS

56:38.080 --> 56:39.830
Good Lord.

56:39.880 --> 56:43.350
But enough about me.
I want to know all about you two.

56:43.400 --> 56:46.430
Go on. Favourite films.
Ladies first.

56:46.480 --> 56:50.110
~ Oh, The Railway Children.
Every time. ~ Oh, yes!

56:50.160 --> 56:53.430
That moment at the end when
Jenny Agutter goes to the station...

56:53.480 --> 56:57.110
~ And the train comes in...
~ The smoke clears... ~ And there he is!

56:57.160 --> 56:58.840
"Daddy, my daddy!"

57:00.840 --> 57:03.350
~ Oh! ~ I never really bothered
with that one.

57:03.400 --> 57:07.470
Always try to avoid films with
the word "children" in the title.

57:07.520 --> 57:09.000
And "Chihuahua".

57:10.000 --> 57:12.910
My favourite's The Sound Of Music.

57:12.960 --> 57:15.990
~ Really? ~ No! Course not!

57:16.040 --> 57:19.430
Top Gun! That's the ticket!
Go, Cruise!

57:19.480 --> 57:24.550
"Son, your ego is writing cheques
your body can't cash!"

57:24.600 --> 57:29.280
~ Genius! ~ Oh, you certainly are
a character, Lawrence!

57:31.120 --> 57:32.550
Can I help clear?

57:32.600 --> 57:35.080
~ Oh, thank you. That's very kind.
~ Waste not.

57:39.000 --> 57:40.510
Oh! No! Er...

57:40.560 --> 57:42.870
Where are my manners? Er...

57:42.920 --> 57:45.550
~ Here, let me. ~ Oh! Well...

57:45.600 --> 57:48.230
If I can't see your kitchen,

57:48.280 --> 57:50.990
can I take a look at
your beautiful balcony?

57:51.040 --> 57:52.990
Certainly.

57:53.040 --> 57:54.760
~ It'd be my honour. ~ Oh.

58:01.880 --> 58:04.240
Oh... goodness!

58:06.640 --> 58:10.430
Who needs to travel the world when
you've got sights like this at home?

58:10.480 --> 58:12.870
It's one of the two great passions
of my life.

58:12.920 --> 58:16.230
Well, I can certainly see that.

58:16.280 --> 58:21.390
~ Look, an avocado plant. ~ Oh, yes.
I grow them myself. From the pips.

58:21.440 --> 58:23.070
That's terribly clever.

58:23.120 --> 58:25.710
~ Thank you. ~ Oh!

58:25.760 --> 58:28.110
Oh, a miniature rose!

58:28.160 --> 58:31.670
Oh! My absolutest favourite!

58:31.720 --> 58:35.880
Well, do tell me,
what is the other passion?

58:38.200 --> 58:39.680
Well, er...

58:41.400 --> 58:43.990
Well, Mrs Silver...

58:44.040 --> 58:48.080
~ It's something I've never spoken to
anyone about. ~ Well, how exciting!

58:49.320 --> 58:51.400
On my... On my mind...

58:52.960 --> 58:55.600
Er... Every moment
of every day, but...

58:57.960 --> 59:00.670
But never once on my lips.

59:00.720 --> 59:02.440
Oh. What could it be?

59:05.800 --> 59:08.910
~ It's... ~ Time for tea, I think.

59:08.960 --> 59:11.280
Shall I bung the kettle on
in the kitchen?

59:13.400 --> 59:15.910
No, no. I'd better do it myself.

59:15.960 --> 59:17.400
Splendid.

59:22.720 --> 59:24.150
Lavinia...

59:24.200 --> 59:26.080
What a gorgeous name that is.

59:27.680 --> 59:29.720
HE WHISPERS AND SHE CHUCKLES

59:35.280 --> 59:37.040
THEY BOTH LAUGH

59:44.800 --> 59:46.600
What a splendid evening!

59:48.800 --> 59:50.590
Lavinia's a good sort, isn't she?

59:50.640 --> 59:53.070
~ Mm. ~ I'm surprised you haven't
made a move on her.

59:53.120 --> 59:55.990
Well, it's funny you should say that
because just between us...

59:56.040 --> 59:58.710
Hope it's OK, I pounced
while you were out making tea.

59:58.760 --> 01:00:01.790
Glad to say
she leapt at the opportunity.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.760
~ Dinner next Tuesday. ~ Oh.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.830
~ That's fast. ~ Yeah.

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:10.830
I suppose the truth is
we're all a little bit lonely

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:13.750
and anything which takes the edge
off, it's got to be a good thing.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.990
~ Hm. ~ Sure that's all right with you?

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:19.270
~ You seemed to be getting on awfully
well during the dinner. ~ Mm.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:23.910
~ I often hear you chatting away on
the balcony. ~ No... Yes, that's fine.

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:27.950
She's got... to be allowed to go out
to dinner with whoever

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.710
she wants to go out to dinner with.

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.190
Next Tuesday.

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:33.950
Splendid, then!

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.750
Who knows? Sparks may fly
when Flat 32 meets Flat 43!

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:40.840
Wish me luck.

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:47.710
Is that wedding bells I hear?

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:50.230
Or just a squeak of bedsprings!

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:53.110
Perfectly happy either way,
eh, Hoppy?

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:54.550
Yes.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:56.480
HE HUMS WEDDING MARCH

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.400
Good night, Lawrence.

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:09.670
'Mr Hoppy felt dead inside.'

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:12.870
Think of the saddest you've ever
felt and then double it.

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:16.710
That was the world of Mr Hoppy's
heart that night.

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.590
Poor Mr Hoppy.

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:23.590
Losing the love of your life is a
terrible feeling. It's an emptiness.

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:27.150
Like the death of a friend.
Or a parent.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:28.560
Or a gerbil.

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:32.400
Or, yes, indeed... a gerbil.

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:39.790
Here's the thing...

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.160
You see, little Alfie?

01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:45.150
HE SIGHS

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:49.750
However many years we live -
and you're a tortoise

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:52.750
so you're in for a lot of them -

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:57.310
there's probably only ten moments
that really matter.

01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:59.840
Ten key moments that seal your fate.

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:05.430
Where we get the chance
to change our lives.

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.080
Get the job we always dreamed of.

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:11.760
Get the perfect girl.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:15.520
Well...

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:20.560
.. I've had my share
of those moments.

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:28.040
And I've blown every
single one of them.

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:33.280
Because the truth is, Alfie...

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:41.600
.. your Mr Henry Hoppy just doesn't
deserve Mrs Lavinia Silver.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:56.310
And so, the next morning, Mr Hoppy
began returning the tortoises.

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:59.310
The game was up. The dream was over.

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:02.510
First to go was the most
important tortoise of all,

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:06.470
the one he picked out at the start,
the trophy tortoise.

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:08.750
Exactly double little
Alfie's weight.

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:13.390
~ I brought you one of my tortoises
to sell. ~ He's a lovely big one!

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:17.030
Yes, he is. 26 ounces, to be exact.

01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:21.150
~ Can I tempt you with something else
to fill the hole in your life? ~ No.

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:24.590
~ Now you say goodbye to the big
fella. ~ No, it's a pretty big hole.

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:26.630
I've got an elephant out back.

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:30.200
Not exactly an elephant. More
a very big dog. Same shape ears.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.600
'One down, 99 to go.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.950
'That evening, Mr Hoppy sat on his
balcony, certain of one thing.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.920
'That he and Mrs Silver
would never be together.'

I want you to know something.

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:12.630
I'm going to fight on till the final
whistle and even if I lose,

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:15.720
even if she marries
Mr Potato Head Pringle...

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:22.080
.. I will always, always
want her to be happy.

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:27.030
Sorry.

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:30.070
It turns out
I couldn't live without him.

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:33.630
I'm not surprised.
He's a laugh a minute, this one.

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:36.950
The times we had... Classic!

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.280
Thank you.

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:06.710
'Where's my boy?

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:09.070
'Where's my Alfie?'

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:10.750
Alfie, Alfie!

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.280
Alfie...

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.870
Oh, my goodness!

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.120
Mr Hoppy?

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:23.550
What, Mrs Silver?

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:27.070
Something very extraordinary
has happened.

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:28.990
What?

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:32.590
Something very, very extraordinary!

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:34.640
And quite marvellous!

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:41.310
Alfie can't get through his door!
He must have got bigger!

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:44.590
She's not very perceptive, is she?
I mean, he's double the size!

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:46.950
No, she's not the sharpest
arrow in the quiver.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.390
~ She's not the cleverest
fox in the forest. ~ No.

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:51.670
~ She's not the smartest
cookie in the jar. ~ No,

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:54.750
but she's full of the joys of life,
and that's what matters.

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:58.550
~ Of course it is. ~ Hey, you! ~ Ah!
~ Ha-ha!

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:01.270
Well, Mrs Silver,

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:03.830
perhaps you should weigh him.

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:06.030
I believe it's been a month

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:08.710
since you started
the Esio Trot experiment.

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:10.030
So it is!

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:14.760
Yes, it's exactly a month!
Oh! How exciting!

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.750
Oh, Mr Hoppy!

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.470
Guess how much he weighs!

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:28.830
~ (26 ounces). ~ 27 ounces!

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:30.510
(You should check your scale.)

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:31.790
Ooh!

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.510
Alfie!

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:37.310
You great big beautiful boy!

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:40.550
Look what clever
Mr Hoppy's done for you!

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:42.400
Oh, you did it, Mr Hoppy!

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:45.830
You're my miracle man.

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:47.600
How can I possibly thank you?

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:55.950
Well, Mrs Silver,

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.870
do you think I could perhaps
pop down to your balcony

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:03.270
and just see for myself how much
Alfie has grown?

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:06.590
Well, of course you can.
Oh, come down at once!

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.080
Oh, my dear man!

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:12.440
Dear man.

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:16.390
HE BREATHS HEAVILY

01:08:16.439 --> 01:08:20.109
Thank you, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:22.790
Thank you, Wallace.
Thank you, Usain.

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:24.640
And thank you, most of all...

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:29.760
.. little original Alfie.

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:47.200
Key moment.

01:08:51.319 --> 01:08:52.790
Where are you?

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:55.069
There you are.

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.080
Oh, don't blow this.

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:37.310
Hurray! Come in at once.

01:09:37.359 --> 01:09:40.310
~ I've just made you
a delicious cup of tea. ~ Oh.

01:09:40.359 --> 01:09:43.710
~ Er... ~ Oh! Oh, clever you!

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:46.520
~ Thank you. ~ Oh, my!

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:52.840
~ Oh, my goodness!
~ SHE CHUCKLES

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:59.790
~ I'd quite forgotten it was
Christmas. ~ Oh, it isn't.

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:03.630
I just like to get my tree up
on the first day of August.

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:07.120
What's the point in getting old
if you can't break the rules?

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:15.270
~ It's my little piece of paradise
in the sky. ~ Perfect.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.720
Oh, and this is Alfie.

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:23.400
Ha-ha!

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:30.520
~ Have you ever held a tortoise before?
~ Once or twice.

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:34.870
I just don't want to drop him.

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:36.950
Oh!

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.630
~ Can I ask you a question? ~ Of course.

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:42.150
Would it be all right
if I came up later

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:45.070
and had another look at your balcony?

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:47.830
I think it's one
of the Seven Wonders of the World.

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:50.670
Who needs the Hanging Gardens
of Babylon

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:54.430
when you've got Mr Hoppy's beautiful
balcony in Bethnal Green?

01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:57.790
Oh, I'd be delighted. Can I ask you
a question too, Mrs Silver?

01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.920
~ Yes, of course. ~ Will you marry me?

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:14.270
That was very out of the blue.

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.910
Yes. It... It... It was.

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:21.310
It's just that I've been meaning
to ask you for some time,

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:23.870
since the first time I saw you,
in fact,

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:29.030
when it was perfectly clear to me
that you are the most... wonderful

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:33.030
and beautiful person
in the Western hemisphere.

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:35.190
Probably the Eastern hemisphere too.

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:38.750
I only exclude it because
I haven't actually been there.

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:40.600
Well...

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:43.390
Well...

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:45.030
Er...
DOORBELL

01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:46.910
Oh!

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:50.400
~ Oh, I'm sorry. ~ Oh. ~ I'd better
get that. I won't be a tick.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.190
Ah, Mrs Silver.
I was just wondering,

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:04.590
might this little chap
belong to you, my dear lady?

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:08.750
Oh, no! Oh, no! My Alfie's much
larger than that these days.

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:11.430
He was just coming out of Mr Hoppy's
flat and I thought,

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:14.030
but it's Mrs Silver that has
the tortoise, isn't it?

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:16.750
Yes, quite. Well... Yes...

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.790
Oh, no...

01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:21.430
He does look very like Alfie
when he was little,

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:23.550
but he can't be darling Alfie.

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:27.190
Cos darling Alfie has
doubled his size in the last month.

01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:28.750
Hasn't he, Mr Hoppy?

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:31.510
~ Doubled in size?
~ Yes. ~ In a month? ~ Yes.

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:33.430
~ A tortoise? ~ Yes.

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:37.830
Mr Hoppy gave me this little poem
of North African origin and said

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:43.310
if I recited it to Alfie three times
a day, he would grow much...

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:45.360
much larger...

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:49.560
A little poem of North African
extraction?

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:54.510
Yes. Bedouin, I believe.

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:56.670
Three times a day?

01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:58.470
Yes, before meals.

01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:03.390
Well, I'm not a biologist.
I'm not Charles Darwin!

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:07.070
I'm not David bloody Attenborough,
but I suspect Mr Hoppy here

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:10.430
has been playing a little joke
on you, my dear Mrs Silver.

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:11.990
Mr...

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:15.550
~ Mr Hoppy? ~ Hoppy!
You're a dark horse, aren't you?

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.960
Should have kept
a sharper eye on you.

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:21.950
Yes...

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.750
~ Well, I think
he might be mine after all. ~ Oh.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.520
Thank you very much.

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:31.880
~ Now, if you'd excuse me
for a moment... ~ Yes, of course.

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:35.430
Don't forget our date on Tuesday.

01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:38.830
We'll have lots to talk about.
Snakes in the grass, etc...

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:41.390
~ I can't wait! ~ Well,
we can discuss that later.

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:42.990
Hoppy...

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:45.790
Good to see you.

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:50.120
Who'd have thought it, eh?
Who'd have damn well thought it?

01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:00.270
~ So... ~ Yes.

01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:04.120
~ You've been swapping tortoises. ~ Yes,
I have. A number of little swaps.

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:09.190
~ And that's not Alfie. ~ No, it isn't.

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:11.070
Who is it?

01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:13.640
Oh, his name is Tyson.
He's quite nice.

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:21.390
And all that... Esio Trot stuff
is just nonsense.

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:23.160
I'm afraid so.

I never was the brightest bulb

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:34.230
~ Maybe not, but you have many other
wonderful qualities... ~ Ssh!

01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:36.400
Not at all the time for that.

01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:46.590
OK, I guess I should go now.

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:48.990
Yes, if you would.

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:50.880

Yes, buddy. I'm sorry to say it is.

01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:00.470
Mr Hoppy doesn't get the girl.

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:04.350
I'm afraid he'll probably spend
the rest of his life alone.

01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:07.990
Which won't be very long,
seeing how old he is.

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:10.670
Which could be for absolutely ages,
Roberta,

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:14.240
seeing how long
people live these days!

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:21.270
Not the ending you were expecting,
I realise that.

01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:26.070
But it's still a story worth telling
because he gave it a go.

01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.390
And that's what matters.

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:31.150

~ I give him a year. Tops. ~ Shush!

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:40.070
You saw how he was yesterday,

01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:43.040
when he came down to our flat
in the afternoon.

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:49.550
Hello. I have a present
for you and your brother.

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:51.270
Come in.

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:52.750
Come on in.

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:54.590
No, that's all right.

01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:59.520
Oh, it's OK, Philip.
I have a present for you.

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:05.990
See? This one's name is Darth
and that one's name is Dolly.

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:10.280
'He gave us Dolly and little Darth
and he was really sad.

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:16.470
'And then you asked him in
for a drink

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:19.040
'and he told you and Mum
the whole story.

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:28.990
'And now he's leaving.'

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:31.590
~ Can't you stop him? ~ No.

01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:34.880
He's made up his mind
the deed is done.

01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:40.960

Hi...

01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:09.560
Mr Hoppy?

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.230
~ Are you leaving? ~ Yes, that's right.

01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:16.350
I felt it best after
the unfortunate incident.

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:19.830
I didn't know.
I'm glad I came up, then.

01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:21.080
Oh...

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:27.470
One of your plants must have blown
over the balcony.

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:30.470
~ I thought I should return it.
~ Oh, yes.

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:32.120
~ Thank you. ~ You're welcome.

01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:37.560
Er... I... Er...

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:44.230
May I... just say that...
I hope you and Mr Pringle

01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:46.830
will be very happy.

01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:49.630
Oh, well... that's very kind of you,
Mr Hoppy.

01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:52.510
But I'm afraid I could never
be happy with Mr Pringle.

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:56.070
I know he's a real pal of yours,
but he is without doubt

01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:59.070
the world's most spectacular
arse-paralysing bore.

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:00.990
And his table manners are atrocious.

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:03.950
I only had two prawns
in my very overpriced,

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.630
under-prawned prawn cocktail.
He took both of them.

01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:10.190
I'm not saying it was the worst
experience of my life,

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:12.910
but I was once mugged in Maida Vale
underground station

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:14.510
by a Russian chap with a big knife

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:16.800
and our date was definitely
worse than that.

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:19.480
My goodness!

01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:25.030
I just have a couple of other things
I want to say.

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:27.750
Parish notices, as it were.

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:29.310
Sure.

01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:31.070
Er...

01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:36.590
First, I think it's only fair to tell
you... Well, before you leave...

01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:38.470
that, um...

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:43.310
ever since I first squeezed up to you
in the lift on my first day,

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:46.800
I've actually had
the most frightful crush on you.

01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:50.320
~ I beg your pardon?
~ You heard me, Hoppy.

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:53.830
Did you never think
it was slightly odd

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:56.800
that we ended up in the lift together
quite so often?

01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:02.560

01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:09.270

01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:22.550
LIFT PINGS

01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:25.280
~ Oh! Hello, Mr Hoppy!
~ Oh...

01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:34.590
Oh.

01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:37.440
But then you went and tricked me.

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:40.950
I know, and I'm...

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.070
Mrs Silver, I'm more sorry
than you can possibly imagine.

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.120
~ It ruined everything. ~ I know.

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:51.510
But then...

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:56.590
there is an argument that a man
who would go to such terrible trouble

01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:59.520
to make a woman's dreams come true...

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:06.480
Well... that man might be
very exceptional indeed.

01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:13.600
So, the final thing I have to say,
I think it's the last...

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:17.950
.. is that, in short,

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.710
the answer to your earlier question,
yes.

01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:24.120
I will marry you.
If you still want me.

01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:27.200
Thank you very much for asking.

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:31.440
Oh, Mrs Silver!

01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:37.350
Thank you.

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:39.390
Well...

01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:42.640
I think we can do better than that,
don't you?

01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:00.230
