WEBVTT

00:06.274 --> 00:07.534
You're on a desert island.

00:07.608 --> 00:09.835
You can bring five books.
Which five do you take?

00:09.911 --> 00:11.535
I gotta read five books?

00:11.612 --> 00:13.839
All right, one.

00:14.815 --> 00:16.405
Come on.

00:16.484 --> 00:18.074
I got it. Three Musketeers.

00:18.152 --> 00:20.982
- You've read that?
- No, I'm saving it for the island.

00:21.055 --> 00:23.783
All right, let's start
this whole thing over.

00:23.858 --> 00:26.688
Best Chamberlain:
Wilt, Richard, or Neville?

00:26.761 --> 00:27.850
For the desert island?

00:27.929 --> 00:29.792
- Okay.
- Richard.

00:29.864 --> 00:31.761
You know, he was in
The Three Musketeers.

00:31.832 --> 00:34.162
Exactly. Save me having
to read the book.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.565
What's going on over there?

00:36.637 --> 00:39.331
I don't know. I gotta see somebody.

00:44.645 --> 00:47.714
So, Marcy, you should have
seen me in the hot tub today.

00:48.349 --> 00:50.178
- Why?
- I was naked.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.751
- Oh, George.
- I saw it.

00:52.820 --> 00:56.048
- How'd he look?
- Okay. I wouldn't see it again.

00:56.657 --> 01:00.090
A friend of mine thought she got
Legionnaires' disease in a hot tub.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.353
Really, what happened?

01:01.429 --> 01:03.759
Yada, yada, yada.
Just some bad egg salad.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.296
I'll be right back.

01:08.302 --> 01:10.233
- Nice girl.
- Lovely.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.429
I notice she's big on
the phrase, "Yada, yada."

01:12.506 --> 01:14.597
- Is "yada yada" bad?
- No, "yada yada"'s good.

01:14.675 --> 01:17.073
- She's very succinct.
- She is succinct.

01:17.144 --> 01:19.075
Yeah, it's like
you're dating USA Today.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.273
- Hey.
- Hey, Tim.

01:22.350 --> 01:25.351
- George, you know Tim Whatley.
- Yeah, dentist to the stars.

01:25.419 --> 01:29.285
- What's up?
- I'll tell you what's up. I'm a Jew.

01:30.124 --> 01:31.657
- Excuse me?
- I'm a Jew.

01:31.726 --> 01:33.657
I finished converting two days ago.

01:34.061 --> 01:37.653
Oh, well, welcome aboard.

01:39.333 --> 01:42.698
- Thanks. So I'll see you tomorrow?
- Yeah, I have a cavity, lower left.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.963
- Were you just at the health club?
- Oh, yeah.

01:45.039 --> 01:47.437
- We must have just missed you.
- I didn't do much.

01:47.508 --> 01:48.870
I just sat in the sauna.

01:48.943 --> 01:51.773
You know, it was more like
a Jewish workout.

01:51.846 --> 01:53.345
I'll see you.

01:58.386 --> 02:02.013
Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days.
He's already making Jewish jokes.

02:02.690 --> 02:07.124
So what? When someone turns 21,
they usually get drunk the first night.

02:07.194 --> 02:08.955
Booze is not a religion.

02:09.030 --> 02:10.562
Tell that to my father.

02:11.899 --> 02:14.695
Anyway, guess what.
Beth Lookner called me.

02:14.769 --> 02:17.963
Beth Lookner. I'm still
waiting out that marriage.

02:18.139 --> 02:21.640
What are you talking about?
That marriage ended six months ago.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.401
She's already remarried.

02:23.677 --> 02:25.210
Where was I?

02:26.080 --> 02:27.477
It was when you were engaged.

02:27.548 --> 02:31.243
Oh, I gotta get on that Internet.
I'm late on everything.

02:32.319 --> 02:35.320
Anyway, so Beth
and her new husband, Arnie...

02:35.389 --> 02:38.686
have listed me as a reference
for an adoption agency.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.156
They're trying to get a baby.

02:40.227 --> 02:43.262
Oh, God, a baby. That can
add two years to a marriage.

02:44.965 --> 02:46.726
Hey. Elaine, all right.

02:46.967 --> 02:50.594
Who looks better
in this shirt, me or Mickey?

02:50.671 --> 02:51.999
We're double-dating tonight.

02:52.073 --> 02:54.539
If we wear the same shirt,
we'll look like idiots.

02:55.209 --> 02:56.674
Turn around.

03:03.117 --> 03:05.981
Well, you're both so striking.

03:06.053 --> 03:07.780
Yeah, tell me about it.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.889
We just picked up two women
at The Gap.

03:10.257 --> 03:13.190
How did you decide which one
of you would date which girl?

03:20.134 --> 03:23.931
So I'm on Third Avenue, minding my
own business and yada, yada, yada.

03:24.004 --> 03:26.800
I get a free massage and a facial.

03:28.275 --> 03:30.536
What a succinct story.

03:30.911 --> 03:33.571
So I'm surprised
you drive a Cadillac.

03:33.647 --> 03:36.147
Oh, it's not mine. It's my mother's.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.308
Are you close with your parents?

03:39.520 --> 03:43.112
Well, they gave birth to me
and yada, yada.

03:43.190 --> 03:44.279
Yada what?

03:44.859 --> 03:47.587
Yada, yada, yada.

03:49.000 --> 03:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:56.770 --> 03:58.394
It's a nice place.

03:58.472 --> 03:59.766
Really nice.

04:01.275 --> 04:03.502
- I like your shirt.
- Oh, thank you.

04:03.577 --> 04:07.135
It's a hundred percent cotton.
And some wool.

04:09.450 --> 04:12.644
Well, you two seem
to have the same taste.

04:13.254 --> 04:16.584
- Well, I like it too.
- Oh, well, I have the same shirt.

04:16.656 --> 04:18.519
Yeah, well, I'm wearing it.

04:20.327 --> 04:21.916
Well, I like your shirt too.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.354
Well, so do I.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.434
Did I mention I'm a serious actor?

04:32.806 --> 04:35.670
- Really?
- I enjoy polo.

04:37.311 --> 04:38.639
I like the beach.

04:39.513 --> 04:42.514
My aunt has been ill of late.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.681
I own a tuxedo.

04:47.221 --> 04:49.551
Anything to drink?
Some wine perhaps?

04:49.623 --> 04:51.452
- I like merlot.
- I love merlot.

04:51.525 --> 04:55.083
- I'm crazy about merlot.
- I live for merlot.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.186
We're out of merlot.

05:03.103 --> 05:04.761
We'll clear out for your interview.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.530
- Okay.
- Make us sound good.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.607
- Oh, come on.
- Bye.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.607
- Bye, Beth. Bye, Arnie.
- Bye.

05:12.279 --> 05:14.108
Nice people.

05:14.181 --> 05:17.216
So you know Beth and Arnie
pretty well?

05:17.284 --> 05:18.749
Oh, yeah, yeah.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.611
Do you socialize with them often?

05:20.688 --> 05:22.813
Yeah, yeah,
we go out to dinner a lot...

05:22.890 --> 05:26.153
usually Chinese.
Well, sometimes Thai.

05:28.162 --> 05:31.390
And we go to the movies.
Arnie's a real film buff.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.925
Actually, I remember this one time.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.229
This is funny.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.833
We went to see
the movie Striptease.

05:40.908 --> 05:44.671
I don't know if you've seen it.
It doesn't matter. Anyway.

05:45.179 --> 05:47.042
And it was during
the opening credits...

05:47.114 --> 05:49.079
it was before
the movie even started.

05:49.149 --> 05:52.343
And I was whispering
something to Beth...

05:52.419 --> 05:56.956
and Arnie leans over to me
and he goes, "Would you shut up?"

05:58.292 --> 06:01.225
I mean, he barely even knew me.
Where did he get off...?

06:12.840 --> 06:15.875
But they're great people.

06:20.481 --> 06:22.105
You're in here.

06:22.750 --> 06:25.580
- What are you doing here?
- I knew you had an appointment.

06:25.653 --> 06:27.948
Well, this is very awkward.

06:28.422 --> 06:30.080
I'll leave when the guy comes in.

06:30.524 --> 06:33.752
Hey, I gotta tell you.
I am loving this yada yada thing.

06:33.827 --> 06:36.157
You know, I can gloss over
my whole life story.

06:36.230 --> 06:39.299
- Look at that.
- Hey, don't play with that.

06:39.366 --> 06:41.229
That's going in my mouth.

06:41.669 --> 06:43.964
- What is this thing?
- All right. That's enough.

06:44.038 --> 06:46.538
- Just get going. Get out of here.
- All right.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.402
- Hey, Tim. Quick question.
- Hey.

06:48.776 --> 06:51.538
Is it normal for your
teeth to make noises...

06:51.612 --> 06:53.577
Iike a hissing or a chirping?

06:53.647 --> 06:55.146
George.

06:56.383 --> 06:59.452
Fine, I'll make an appointment.

06:59.620 --> 07:03.816
All right. It is cavity time.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.453
Here we go.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.723
Reminds me,
you hear the one about the rabbi...

07:11.799 --> 07:14.265
and the farmer's daughter, huh?

07:15.903 --> 07:18.437
"Those aren't matzo balls."

07:20.007 --> 07:22.075
- What?
- Tim, do you think you should be...

07:22.142 --> 07:23.675
making jokes like that?

07:23.744 --> 07:26.005
Why not? I'm Jewish. Remember?

07:26.880 --> 07:30.143
- I know, but...
- Jerry, it's our sense of humor...

07:30.217 --> 07:33.514
that sustained us
as a people for 3000 years.

07:34.488 --> 07:38.046
- Five thousand.
- Five thousand, even better.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.795
Okay. Chrissy...

07:42.863 --> 07:44.624
give me a shtickl of fluoride.

07:49.303 --> 07:52.736
And then he asked the assistant
for a shtickl of fluoride.

07:53.674 --> 07:56.038
Why are you so
concerned about this?

07:56.110 --> 07:57.677
I'll tell you why.

07:57.745 --> 08:02.646
Because I believe Whatley converted
to Judaism just for the jokes.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.310
- Hello.
- Would you be interested...

08:07.388 --> 08:09.649
in a subscription
to the New York Times?

08:09.723 --> 08:11.381
Yes.

08:17.297 --> 08:20.127
- Well, I don't believe that.
- If you'd got in the back seat...

08:20.200 --> 08:21.733
we could've figured this out.

08:21.802 --> 08:24.166
Well, why were you holding
the door open for?

08:24.238 --> 08:27.205
Not for you. Who holds
a door open for a man?

08:27.274 --> 08:31.572
Well, I thought it was a nice gesture,
but I guess I was wrong.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.904
Let's just put their names in a hat.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.844
I don't even know their names.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.609
Look, why don't you take
the one on the left?

08:39.686 --> 08:43.051
- I'm not sure she's my type.
- Oh, everybody's your type.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.747
What the hell does that mean?

08:44.825 --> 08:47.621
- You've been married three times.
- That's it. It's go time.

08:47.694 --> 08:50.524
- All right. Take it easy. Easy, easy.
- Hey, hey, hey!

08:50.597 --> 08:53.632
No, come on, let him go.
You wanna throw? Let's throw!

08:53.700 --> 08:57.930
Hey, hey! Hold on a second.

08:59.973 --> 09:02.200
All right, look. I got an idea.

09:02.276 --> 09:05.311
Why don't you just
show up early for your next date...

09:05.379 --> 09:09.916
sit across from each other
and see who the girls sit next to.

09:11.718 --> 09:14.378
- That's not bad.
- All right. So we let the girls decide.

09:14.455 --> 09:16.546
Yeah, why should we
knock ourselves out?

09:16.623 --> 09:19.920
- I wanna wear that shirt next time.
- No one wears the shirt next time.

09:19.993 --> 09:23.551
- Right, because they already saw it.
- We'll look like idiots.

09:24.832 --> 09:28.390
Well, we.... We were engaged
to be married.

09:29.169 --> 09:32.898
We bought
the wedding invitations and...

09:33.340 --> 09:36.273
yada, yada, yada. I'm still single.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.136
So, what's she doing now?

09:40.747 --> 09:42.280
Yada.

09:42.349 --> 09:46.146
- I get it.
- I love talking to you.

09:46.620 --> 09:50.053
Me too. So speaking of exes...

09:50.123 --> 09:52.589
my old boyfriend
came over late last night...

09:52.659 --> 09:57.822
and yada, yada, yada.
Anyway, I'm really tired today.

10:08.575 --> 10:12.270
Beth, Arnie, hi. What's up?

10:12.679 --> 10:15.304
Well, our adoption
application was denied.

10:15.782 --> 10:18.316
- Really?
- The adoption agent seems to feel...

10:18.385 --> 10:20.612
that Arnie has a violent temper.

10:22.256 --> 10:24.290
So we're just asking our friends...

10:24.358 --> 10:26.790
what they may have said
to the adoption agent.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.025
Well, I....

10:30.664 --> 10:34.962
You know, I just told them
what kind people you are...

10:35.035 --> 10:38.036
and how Arnie's a big movie buff...

10:38.105 --> 10:42.164
and yada, yada, yada. That is it.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.314
How you doing?

10:48.382 --> 10:50.211
I have some discomfort in my molar.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.211
You like Tootsie Rolls, don't you?

10:53.220 --> 10:54.981
Father Curtis,
why don't you come in?

10:56.757 --> 10:59.451
Father Curtis, good guy.
Oh, which reminds me.

10:59.526 --> 11:02.993
Did you hear the one about the pope
and Raquel Welch on the lifeboat?

11:04.097 --> 11:06.097
I'll tell you later.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.833
Whatley.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.867
What are they doing here?

11:14.942 --> 11:16.771
Told you we should've
gotten here early.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.968
All right. Okay, now what are
we going to do?

11:19.046 --> 11:20.477
All right. Don't panic.

11:20.547 --> 11:22.842
Let's just decide now.
Which one do you want?

11:24.284 --> 11:26.181
- I'll take Julie.
- I knew you wanted her.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.548
- That's who I wanted.
- All right. I'll take Karen.

11:28.622 --> 11:31.088
No, you think I'm falling for that?
I'll take Karen.

11:31.158 --> 11:33.818
Fine. I'll take Julie.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.894
All right. Which one is Julie?

11:38.498 --> 11:40.532
I don't know.

11:40.934 --> 11:43.525
- Why don't we just grab a chair?
- You first.

11:43.604 --> 11:45.194
No, you first.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.931
- How you doing?
- Good evening.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.113
Stop.

12:02.255 --> 12:05.222
Well, you ladies look lovely tonight.

12:12.199 --> 12:14.927
So Whatley says to me,
"Hey, I can make Catholic jokes.

12:15.002 --> 12:16.660
I used to be Catholic."

12:16.903 --> 12:19.130
Now, see, I don't think
it is a Catholic joke.

12:19.206 --> 12:21.638
I think it's more
of a Raquel Welch joke.

12:21.875 --> 12:26.844
What was it?
"No, I said, 'Hand me the buoys."'

12:31.318 --> 12:33.249
"Buoys."

12:34.388 --> 12:37.218
Don't you see
what Whatley is after?

12:37.290 --> 12:39.051
Total joke-telling immunity.

12:39.126 --> 12:41.285
He's already got
the big two religions covered.

12:41.361 --> 12:44.487
If he ever gets Polish citizenship,
there'll be no stopping him.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.328
So, what are you going to do?

12:46.633 --> 12:49.566
I think this Father Curtis
might be very interested to hear...

12:49.636 --> 12:53.331
what Whatley has
the pope doing with Raquel Welch.

12:54.841 --> 12:57.239
Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine.

12:57.310 --> 13:00.538
Thought you guys might wanna
have lunch. Give me a call. Bye.

13:00.847 --> 13:03.939
They're not getting a baby,
so you're taking them to lunch.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.009
I thought it would be nice.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.977
- Poor Beth.
- Hey, Arnie's just as upset.

13:09.056 --> 13:11.056
Oh, screw him.

13:11.858 --> 13:13.186
Listen to this.

13:13.260 --> 13:16.591
Marcy comes over, tells me her
ex-boyfriend was over late last night...

13:16.663 --> 13:20.460
and "Yada, yada, yada,
I'm really tired today."

13:22.002 --> 13:26.436
- What do you think she's tired from?
- Well, obviously the yada yada.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.566
You don't think
she'd yada yada sex?

13:30.577 --> 13:32.907
I've yada yada-ed sex.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.343
- Really?
- Yeah. I met this lawyer.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.642
We went out to dinner.
I had the lobster bisque.

13:37.718 --> 13:39.809
We went back to my place.
Yada, yada, yada...

13:39.886 --> 13:42.386
I never heard from him again.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.991
But you yada yada-ed
over the best part.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.559
No, I mentioned the bisque.

13:53.066 --> 13:55.828
Well, I gotta do something.

13:58.705 --> 14:00.705
Well, I gotta do something.

14:00.874 --> 14:03.033
George is already in there.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.746
No, Mickey and I.
We can't work it out.

14:07.814 --> 14:11.509
You know, I'm thinking of asking that
Karen out by myself. She's the one.

14:11.585 --> 14:13.118
You were leaning towards Julie.

14:13.186 --> 14:17.450
Well, I was. But the one I thought
was Julie turned out to be Karen.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.453
Well, it was a hell of a yada yada.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.188
He's moving to Seattle.
He wanted to say goodbye.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.958
I was just getting out of the shower
and yada, yada, yada...

14:27.033 --> 14:28.464
All right. Enough. Enough.

14:28.535 --> 14:33.800
From now on, no more yada yadas.
Just give me the full story.

14:33.874 --> 14:36.067
Okay. Well...

14:36.143 --> 14:38.370
when I got out of the shower,
I was dripping...

14:38.445 --> 14:41.207
Not that story. Another story.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.975
Tell me about the free facial.

14:44.151 --> 14:48.153
Okay, well, like I said,
I was on Third Avenue...

14:48.221 --> 14:50.653
and I stopped by
a large department store.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.724
- Which one?
- Bloomingdale's.

14:52.793 --> 14:54.485
Very good. Go on.

14:55.562 --> 15:00.156
- And... Oh, I stole a Piaget watch.
- What's that?

15:00.233 --> 15:03.393
And then I was on such a high...

15:03.470 --> 15:06.664
that I went upstairs
to the salon on the fifth floor...

15:06.740 --> 15:12.107
and got a massage and a
facial and skipped out on the bill.

15:18.151 --> 15:19.809
Shoplifting.

15:19.886 --> 15:23.478
Well, what about you?
You told me that you were engaged.

15:23.557 --> 15:25.284
What was the rest of that?

15:35.268 --> 15:36.665
Excuse me, Mother?

15:36.937 --> 15:39.096
- Sister.
- Sister. Right.

15:39.172 --> 15:41.832
Do you know when
Father Curtis has office hours?

15:41.908 --> 15:43.305
Well, not until tomorrow.

15:44.044 --> 15:46.374
I really need to speak with him.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.066
You know, that's a kneeler.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.112
Tell me your sins, my son.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.376
Well, I should mention
that I'm Jewish.

16:25.452 --> 16:28.043
- Oh, that's no sin.
- Oh, good.

16:30.457 --> 16:33.117
Anyway, I wanted to talk
to you about Dr. Whatley.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.521
I have a suspicion...

16:34.594 --> 16:38.357
that he's converted
to Judaism purely for the jokes.

16:38.965 --> 16:41.625
And this offends you
as a Jewish person?

16:41.701 --> 16:44.497
No, it offends me as a comedian.

16:51.311 --> 16:56.007
And it'll interest you to know
that he's also telling Catholic jokes.

16:56.082 --> 16:59.208
- Well...
- And, I mean, they're old jokes.

16:59.286 --> 17:03.550
I mean, the pope and
Raquel Welch in a lifeboat.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.656
I haven't heard that one.

17:08.028 --> 17:10.653
Oh, I'm sure you have.
They're out on the ocean...

17:10.730 --> 17:13.127
and yada, yada, yada and she...

17:13.199 --> 17:16.233
And she says, "Those aren't buoys."

17:22.943 --> 17:25.340
- Father.
- One second.

17:29.215 --> 17:32.580
Well, if it would make you feel
better, I could speak to Dr. Whatley.

17:32.652 --> 17:35.152
I have to go back and have
a wisdom tooth removed.

17:35.221 --> 17:36.982
Good luck.
You know the difference...

17:37.057 --> 17:39.990
between a dentist
and a sadist, don't you?

17:40.060 --> 17:42.321
Newer magazines.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.095
That's funny.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.532
Now if you would excuse me.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.433
Jerry, I gotta talk to you.

18:05.819 --> 18:07.477
- Hi.
- Hi, Kramer.

18:08.321 --> 18:09.854
Got a minute?

18:09.923 --> 18:13.254
Actually, my parents are over,
but would you like to meet them?

18:13.326 --> 18:15.656
- Yeah.
- Mom, Dad.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.295
Hi.

18:26.806 --> 18:29.534
Elaine, I have to ask you
about something.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.643
- What?
- The yada yada.

18:31.711 --> 18:34.644
- Yada yada?
- What exactly happened down there?

18:36.349 --> 18:40.385
Well, I don't know.
I mean, I talked to him...

18:40.453 --> 18:45.650
and blah, blah, blah.
He asked about you guys and:

18:45.725 --> 18:49.124
More questions. Blah, blah, blah.

18:49.195 --> 18:50.557
All right. Shut up.

18:51.664 --> 18:54.631
Shut up? Again you are telling
me to shut up?

18:54.701 --> 18:56.393
- What?
- You yelled at me...

18:56.469 --> 18:58.127
that time at the movies.

18:58.204 --> 19:01.205
That's why you're not
getting the baby.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.066
And you told that
to the adoption guy?

19:05.378 --> 19:08.140
- Slipped out.
- Oh, God.

19:08.214 --> 19:09.906
What am I gonna tell Beth?

19:11.084 --> 19:15.086
Well, Arnie, look, I'll go down
and talk to this adoption guy...

19:15.155 --> 19:17.348
and make sure
it all gets straightened out.

19:17.424 --> 19:22.427
- Just don't screw it up this time!
- See, again you're yelling.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.995
Not a fan of the yelling.

19:32.072 --> 19:33.605
Are you about done?

19:33.940 --> 19:35.598
Oh, I'm just getting warmed up.

19:38.645 --> 19:41.873
Because I'm just a sadist
with newer magazines.

19:44.417 --> 19:48.453
Father Curtis told me your little joke.
I really didn't appreciate it.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.946
Well, what about
all your Jewish jokes?

19:51.024 --> 19:53.615
I'm Jewish. You're not a dentist.

19:55.228 --> 19:58.729
You have no idea what my people
have been through.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.126
- The Jews?
- No, the dentists.

20:05.004 --> 20:07.800
You know, we have the highest
suicide rate of any profession.

20:08.274 --> 20:10.808
Is that why it's so hard
to get an appointment?

20:14.881 --> 20:19.577
So I'll.... I'll see you
tonight, huh? Okay.

20:20.553 --> 20:23.144
- Date with Karen?
- No, Julie.

20:23.490 --> 20:25.558
- She's the one.
- What happened to Karen?

20:25.625 --> 20:29.320
Well, Mickey and her have more in
common. Her parents are little people.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.429
Oh, small world.

20:32.365 --> 20:35.332
So little people can have
"non-little-people" children?

20:35.401 --> 20:37.298
Oh, yeah, and vice versa.

20:37.370 --> 20:40.769
Yeah, Mother Nature's
a mad scientist, Jerry.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.702
So you won't believe
what happened with Whatley.

20:43.776 --> 20:47.835
It got back to him that I made this little
dentist joke and he got all offended.

20:48.348 --> 20:50.814
Those people can be so touchy.

20:50.884 --> 20:55.580
- "Those people." Listen to yourself.
- What?

20:55.722 --> 20:58.882
You think that dentists are
so different from me and you?

20:58.958 --> 21:03.461
They came to this country just like
everybody else in search of a dream.

21:03.530 --> 21:05.928
- Whatley's from Jersey.
- Yes, and now...

21:05.999 --> 21:08.499
he's a full-fledged American.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.761
Kramer, he's just a dentist.

21:10.837 --> 21:13.735
Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite.

21:16.176 --> 21:18.005
I am not an anti-dentite.

21:18.077 --> 21:20.611
You're a rabid anti-dentite.

21:21.981 --> 21:24.572
Oh, it starts with a few jokes
and some slurs:

21:24.651 --> 21:27.049
"Hey, denty."

21:27.120 --> 21:30.314
Next thing you know, you're saying
they should have their own schools.

21:30.390 --> 21:33.288
- They do have their own schools.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

21:35.862 --> 21:41.025
Oh, come on. One little baby,
whatever you have in stock.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.498
- Miss Benes, please.
- Lookit, lookit, Brian.

21:44.404 --> 21:49.669
These people are getting
a baby, period.

21:49.742 --> 21:53.539
Now, we can do this the easy way...

21:53.613 --> 21:58.047
or we can do this...

21:58.117 --> 21:59.878
the fun way.

22:10.396 --> 22:12.589
I'm sorry to bother you.
But you always said...

22:12.665 --> 22:14.596
- you'd be there for me.
- What's wrong?

22:14.667 --> 22:18.032
- I'm thinking of leaving Arnie.
- Talk to me.

22:19.606 --> 22:22.607
He met with Elaine,
and I asked him what happened.

22:22.675 --> 22:25.608
And he yada yada-ed me.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.405
Could they be having an affair?

22:27.480 --> 22:29.377
I wouldn't put
anything past anybody.

22:29.549 --> 22:31.116
But we just got married.

22:31.184 --> 22:33.548
Well, obviously, that was a mistake.

22:33.620 --> 22:37.918
You need to forget about Arnie. The
important thing is you're moving on.

22:37.991 --> 22:40.218
Why would Elaine do that to me?

22:40.293 --> 22:43.521
Forget about Elaine.
Let's just focus on us.

22:43.596 --> 22:45.789
- Come on, big hug.
- Hey, Jerry.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.728
Where's Kramer?
I've got exciting news.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.801
- I'm in the middle of something.
- Karen and I are getting married.

22:50.870 --> 22:54.406
Oh, congratulations.
Her marriage just fell apart.

22:54.641 --> 22:56.936
- How many is that for you?
- Two.

22:57.343 --> 23:00.003
You're a lightweight.
Come on, honey.

23:07.654 --> 23:09.813
This church give you any ideas?

23:12.058 --> 23:13.318
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hey.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.625
What are you doing here with Beth?

23:18.831 --> 23:20.660
Beth and Arnie broke up.

23:21.134 --> 23:23.065
So they don't want a baby?

23:32.645 --> 23:35.714
I think I'm gonna be sick.

23:39.952 --> 23:41.952
Hey, where's Marcy?

23:42.555 --> 23:47.183
She went shopping
for some shoes for the wedding...

23:47.260 --> 23:51.023
and yada, yada, yada,
I'll see her in six to eight months.

23:56.169 --> 23:59.363
- Hey, Kramer, over here.
- I'd just as soon not sit next to you.

24:00.006 --> 24:01.232
Kramer.

24:08.214 --> 24:11.977
- Look, there's Mickey and his parents.
- Oh, a nice-looking family.

24:12.051 --> 24:13.641
Very handsome.

24:14.287 --> 24:16.218
How you doing?

24:16.289 --> 24:18.186
Hey, Kramer.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.124
You must be so proud.

24:28.201 --> 24:30.599
We never thought he'd settle down.

24:30.670 --> 24:32.795
Well, not again.

24:34.907 --> 24:39.239
Oh, Mickey. Excuse me.
I can't take this.

24:45.518 --> 24:47.347
Hi, Mr. Abbott.

24:48.821 --> 24:52.118
That's Dr. Abbott, D.D.S.

24:52.191 --> 24:54.885
Tim Whatley was
one of my students.

24:54.961 --> 24:57.495
And if this wasn't
my son's wedding day...

24:57.563 --> 25:02.066
I'd knock your teeth out,
you anti-dentite bastard.

25:03.636 --> 25:05.670
What was that all about?

25:05.738 --> 25:09.740
Oh, I said something about dentists,
and it got blown all out of proportion.

25:10.243 --> 25:13.779
Hey, what do you call a doctor
who fails out of med school?

25:13.846 --> 25:16.312
- What?
- A dentist.

25:17.383 --> 25:19.474
- That's a good one.
- Yeah.

25:19.552 --> 25:22.348
- Dentists.
- Yeah, who needs them?

25:22.422 --> 25:24.456
Not to mention
the blacks and the Jews.

25:41.574 --> 25:45.235
- Where's Beth?
- She ran out to get her head shaved.

25:46.045 --> 25:48.773
We are gathered here today
to unite this couple...

25:48.848 --> 25:52.611
in the bonds of holy matrimony.

25:53.052 --> 25:55.484
Those wisdom teeth
are tough to get out.

25:55.555 --> 26:00.183
Marriage is not an institution
to be entered into lightly.

26:00.259 --> 26:03.795
Yada, yada, yada.
I pronounce you man and wife.

26:17.210 --> 26:19.540
I really wanted you.
