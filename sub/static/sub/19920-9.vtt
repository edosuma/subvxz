WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.492
<i>Previously on "Shots Fired"...</i>

00:01.539 --> 00:03.210
The gun found in your office
was the same gun

00:03.273 --> 00:04.765
used to kill Joey Campbell.

00:04.813 --> 00:06.214
We had a break-in a few nights ago.

00:06.281 --> 00:08.216
Maybe that's when the gun was planted.

00:08.283 --> 00:10.117
Lieutenant Breeland found a witness

00:10.185 --> 00:11.752
who contradicted your theories

00:11.820 --> 00:13.788
regarding a link between
the Carr and Campbell shooting.

00:13.856 --> 00:16.041
Ruiz is prepping
a new team to take over.

00:16.111 --> 00:17.558
You both have a week to finish up.

00:17.626 --> 00:18.826
The gun used to kill Joey Campbell

00:18.894 --> 00:20.962
- is yours.
- It was stolen.

00:21.029 --> 00:24.065
Those two people are aiming
to blame that killing on me.

00:24.132 --> 00:25.700
ASHE: <i>Someone broke into our work space,</i>

00:25.767 --> 00:27.468
<i>sucker-punched me, and
I'm still mad about it.</i>

00:27.536 --> 00:29.776
They were after the video we
recovered off Jesse's phone.

00:29.837 --> 00:31.369
They don't have a video.
They're bluffing.

00:31.416 --> 00:32.363
Jesse didn't open his door.

00:32.430 --> 00:33.865
You pulled it open for him.

00:33.933 --> 00:36.086
I got your text. You're done
messing with my daughter.

00:36.111 --> 00:38.136
You were there when
Arlen Cox killed Joey.

00:38.204 --> 00:41.339
You ever want to be a mother
to your little girl again,

00:41.407 --> 00:43.608
you better start figuring out
what the word "smart" means.

00:44.110 --> 00:45.777
(both grunting)

00:45.845 --> 00:46.978
<i>I just lost Kai.</i>

00:47.046 --> 00:49.147
I killed somebody's child.
Why shouldn't I lose mine?

00:49.215 --> 00:50.549
Hey.

00:52.552 --> 00:53.985

01:51.344 --> 01:53.278
Never been more focused in my life.

01:57.950 --> 02:01.553
The new team's arriving in two days.

02:01.621 --> 02:04.556
I don't want them messing up
what we started.

02:04.624 --> 02:07.258

02:07.326 --> 02:09.461
You and me.

02:12.965 --> 02:16.314
<i>The footage you're about to see
was uncovered on social media.</i>

JESSE: <i>Why did you pull me over?</i>

02:19.587 --> 02:21.973
BECK: <i>Because you don't look right.</i>

02:22.041 --> 02:24.476
JESSE: <i>I didn't realize it was
illegal to be in this part of town.</i>

02:24.543 --> 02:26.945
BECK: <i>Depends on what you're doing here.</i>

02:27.013 --> 02:29.981
JESSE: <i>I came for some fried chicken.</i>

02:30.049 --> 02:31.282
You released it.

02:31.350 --> 02:33.318
I meant to send it to my account

02:33.386 --> 02:36.955
but I accidentally shared it
with Jesse's network.

02:37.023 --> 02:39.090
That's the story you're sellin'?

02:39.158 --> 02:40.325
Yeah.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.595

Alicia...

Alicia...

03:37.683 --> 03:39.494
Your memories of him,

03:39.652 --> 03:41.686
those are things between the two of you

03:41.754 --> 03:43.655
that ain't never gonna change.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.024
That the world can't touch.

03:46.092 --> 03:49.294
That's the truth you gonna hold on to.

03:49.361 --> 03:50.595
Not this.

03:56.235 --> 03:59.471
REPORTER: Sir... did you know
about the video, Sheriff?

03:59.538 --> 04:01.406
Does the department still
stand behind Deputy Beck?

04:01.474 --> 04:02.573
Will Beck finally be arrested?

04:02.629 --> 04:04.030
I know y'all are anxious for answers

04:04.105 --> 04:07.549
and, uh, I wish that I had them.

04:08.112 --> 04:11.026
We're just as surprised at this
latest development as you are.

04:11.057 --> 04:12.888
Any idea where the video came from?

04:12.947 --> 04:15.353
The department's spokesperson
will be releasing

04:15.447 --> 04:17.916
an official statement later today.

04:18.156 --> 04:20.925
I have no further comment
at this time. Thank you.

04:20.993 --> 04:22.594
How can your department support
a murderer?

04:29.201 --> 04:32.637
<i>Deputy Beck has been suspended.</i>

04:32.705 --> 04:35.173
<i>He is under a DOJ investigation.</i>

04:35.241 --> 04:37.575
<i>We are not supporting a murderer,</i>

04:37.643 --> 04:39.677
<i>we are supporting the legal process.</i>

04:39.745 --> 04:41.112
<i>Thank you.</i>

04:41.404 --> 04:43.681
- BREELAND: Tess, where are your sisters?
- They're coming.

04:43.749 --> 04:45.150
Y'all are gonna be late.

04:46.252 --> 04:47.986
Oh, my God, Daddy.

04:48.053 --> 04:50.588
It's nothing, I just got into it
with another cop last night.

04:50.656 --> 04:51.856
Are you okay?

04:51.924 --> 04:53.258
Yeah, it looks worse than it feels.

04:54.119 --> 04:56.694
Does that have anything to do
with that video on TV this morning?

04:56.762 --> 05:00.098
No, no, separate matter altogether.

05:00.166 --> 05:01.533
Hope the other guy looks worse.

05:04.488 --> 05:06.704
- Come on, girls.
- All right.

05:53.876 --> 05:56.588
Yeah, okay, fellas, real cute.

06:17.142 --> 06:19.944
You got a complaint, you can
take it up with the department.

06:20.012 --> 06:21.746
Sit down.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.749
Don't make me say it again.

06:36.061 --> 06:38.263
I know Breeland put you up to that stop.

06:38.330 --> 06:39.664
You missed a yield sign.

06:39.732 --> 06:42.066
You pulled your gun on me
for failing to yield?

06:42.134 --> 06:43.668
That was for assaulting an officer.

06:47.306 --> 06:49.674
So what happens if you shot me?

06:49.742 --> 06:52.076
What would you have done?

06:52.144 --> 06:54.579
Bury me and pray my body
never washed up?

06:54.647 --> 06:56.281
You're really willing to go down

06:56.348 --> 06:58.483
for a superior officer who would
put your life in jeopardy?

06:58.550 --> 06:59.884
You got nothing on me.

07:02.187 --> 07:06.190
You're one of the deputies named
in our corruption report.

07:07.326 --> 07:09.861
Nobody comes out of this clean.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.629
I know you got kids.

07:11.697 --> 07:13.197
So think.

07:13.265 --> 07:17.135
No pension, no paid leave, no future.

07:17.202 --> 07:19.070
But I can make sure that doesn't happen.

07:23.275 --> 07:24.809
I work with these people.

07:24.877 --> 07:26.778
DOJ can protect you.

07:26.845 --> 07:28.713
Rumor has it, you and that
lawyer are gonna be replaced.

07:30.382 --> 07:33.217
Where's my protection then, hmm?

07:39.358 --> 07:40.825
PROTESTORS (chanting):
Justice for Jesse!

07:40.893 --> 07:42.226
Justice for Jesse!

07:42.294 --> 07:45.330
Justice for Jesse! Justice for Jesse!

07:45.397 --> 07:47.241
Justice for Jesse!

07:47.266 --> 07:49.034
My client maintains his innocence.

07:49.090 --> 07:50.702
That video paints a different picture.

07:50.727 --> 07:52.342
The video does not tell the full story.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.334
It only kills my credibility.

07:54.359 --> 07:55.359
Which is what you wanted.

07:55.384 --> 07:56.984
I want justice to be served.

07:57.009 --> 07:58.454
Did you orchestrate
the release of the video?

07:58.479 --> 07:59.439
With all due respect,

07:59.464 --> 08:00.637
that is the least
of your concerns right now.

08:00.662 --> 08:02.347
BECK: I can't even have my family here.

08:02.414 --> 08:03.948
Is that not a concern?

08:05.728 --> 08:09.539
They walk out of this house
and have crazy people in their face.

08:10.065 --> 08:13.267
My kids have people telling them
I'm a monster.

08:13.292 --> 08:14.926
Mr. Beck.

08:15.015 --> 08:17.937
- Calm down.
- Why am I here, Joshua?

08:26.438 --> 08:27.972
(sighs)

08:31.944 --> 08:33.244
What's this?

08:35.347 --> 08:38.227
Records of everyone who
went through the Tours.

08:38.336 --> 08:41.157
You mean the same Tours you told me
you knew nothing about?

08:41.820 --> 08:45.157
- I have all this information already.
- Your documents are falsified.

08:45.876 --> 08:47.931
After Joey's murder.

08:48.961 --> 08:50.561
Those are the real things.

08:52.454 --> 08:54.130
The Auxiliary Deputies never went

08:54.169 --> 08:58.002
through the required 480 hours
of field officer training.

08:58.333 --> 09:01.013
Nor were they ever qualified
to even carry a weapon.

09:01.473 --> 09:03.908
But they still went on patrols
with Breeland and Derkin,

09:03.976 --> 09:05.610
carried their own personal firearms,

09:05.677 --> 09:07.745
and received department-issued Tasers.

09:07.813 --> 09:09.247
It's all there...

09:09.314 --> 09:12.350
dates, arrests, everything.

09:12.418 --> 09:14.585
How long have you had these?

09:16.922 --> 09:18.523
Couple of months.

09:25.798 --> 09:27.565
What do you want?

09:27.633 --> 09:29.767
We want Deputy Beck's
cooperation in the matter

09:29.835 --> 09:31.436
to be taken into consideration.

09:31.503 --> 09:33.738
He killed Jesse.

09:33.806 --> 09:35.106
And his silence killed Joey.

09:35.174 --> 09:37.275
I didn't murder Jesse.

09:37.342 --> 09:41.612
You saved these documents
because you wanted to speak up.

09:41.680 --> 09:44.749
Then something stopped you.

09:44.817 --> 09:45.983
Why the change of heart?

09:47.719 --> 09:49.287
I'm done bleeding blue.

09:55.518 --> 09:56.952
I'm sorry to interrupt,

09:57.020 --> 09:59.422
but they just sent over
the revised budget.

09:59.489 --> 10:01.565
You're killing the education initiative?

10:01.658 --> 10:02.992
The riots wreaked havoc

10:03.049 --> 10:04.775
on funds we appropriated
for Gate Station.

10:04.842 --> 10:06.543
I asked Arlen if he would funnel

10:06.611 --> 10:08.678
his support for the education initiative

10:08.746 --> 10:10.447
to our rebuilding efforts.

10:10.515 --> 10:13.550
Even with federal aid,
we're nearly $12 million short.

10:13.618 --> 10:15.285
Something had to go.

10:15.353 --> 10:17.120
What about Shawn Campbell?

10:17.188 --> 10:19.689
We looked his mother in the eye
and we made promises.

10:19.757 --> 10:22.058
We can't just pull him out of Lorton.

10:22.126 --> 10:24.381
I assure you I've considered every option.

10:24.405 --> 10:26.272
- But...
- Sarah, we took a swing

10:26.296 --> 10:27.545
few others would have taken,

10:27.608 --> 10:30.432
but if we're being honest,
the education initiative

10:30.500 --> 10:31.834
was a hard sell from the start.

10:31.901 --> 10:34.570
We silenced our detractors.

10:34.637 --> 10:37.739
And we did it without compromising.

10:37.807 --> 10:40.843
Those-those parents who were
so afraid of kids from The Houses

10:40.910 --> 10:42.177
coming into their schools
stopped fighting us

10:42.245 --> 10:43.412
because they realized
they had nothing to fear.

10:43.480 --> 10:47.616
What kind of message are we sending
if we just shut them down?

10:47.684 --> 10:50.953
Mr. Terry, thank you for coming.
Join me outside?

10:52.568 --> 10:55.390
I'm assuming with this latest
video coming to light,

10:55.458 --> 10:57.759
Deputy Beck's arrest is imminent.

10:57.827 --> 10:59.995
My decision on whether or not
to indict is imminent.

11:00.063 --> 11:02.331
If you had listened to my
suggestion from the beginning,

11:02.398 --> 11:03.565
this all could have been avoided.

11:03.633 --> 11:05.667
What could have been avoided, Governor?

11:05.735 --> 11:07.669
The culture of corruption
left unchecked by the city

11:07.737 --> 11:09.991
or the uprising that happened
as a direct result of it?

11:10.016 --> 11:11.264
Are you able to substantiate

11:11.289 --> 11:12.641
your claims against
the Sheriff's Office?

11:12.709 --> 11:14.543
Are you genuinely asking
or are you looking for a way

11:14.568 --> 11:15.773
to get your name out from under it?

11:15.798 --> 11:18.714
I just spent 48 sleepless hours
balancing the budget

11:18.781 --> 11:21.383
to help the people
of Gate Station rebuild.

11:21.451 --> 11:23.986
If you have hard evidence that a
program I helped to implement

11:24.053 --> 11:26.221
is corrupt, I need to know.

11:26.289 --> 11:28.423
Your Auxiliary Deputies
were never qualified

11:28.491 --> 11:29.992
to carry any weapons,

11:30.059 --> 11:32.227
never received any training
to get out on the field.

11:32.295 --> 11:34.496
The reports were falsified
to cover it up.

11:35.899 --> 11:37.499
And you have the names
of people involved?

11:37.567 --> 11:39.701
Names, dates, everything.

11:39.769 --> 11:41.169
There may have only been one shooter,

11:41.237 --> 11:43.038
but Joey's blood is on a lot of hands.

11:43.106 --> 11:46.742
If this is true, my heart will be broken

11:46.809 --> 11:48.944
and I can promise you, I will make sure

11:49.012 --> 11:51.113
those responsible are held accountable.

12:05.228 --> 12:06.395
You fight dirty.

12:08.932 --> 12:12.000
I guess I can respect that.

12:12.068 --> 12:13.535
We do what we gotta do.

12:13.603 --> 12:16.505
You need to cooperate
with this investigation.

12:16.573 --> 12:18.373
We know the training records
were falsified,

12:18.441 --> 12:21.352
and we know you planted weed
in Jesse's car to keep Beck quiet.

12:21.544 --> 12:23.245
Did Beck say I planted weed?

12:23.712 --> 12:25.360
Anyone see me plant weed?

12:25.438 --> 12:27.316
No. Do you want to know why?

12:27.383 --> 12:30.385
Because I reported exactly what I found.

12:30.453 --> 12:32.487
So you're saying Beck's
the one who planted it.

12:32.555 --> 12:34.089
I did not say that.

12:34.157 --> 12:36.533
Of course not. You're too good a soldier.

12:36.761 --> 12:38.915
So let me tell you what's in play.

12:40.463 --> 12:42.236
You're either gonna take all the heat

12:42.432 --> 12:45.337
or you're gonna let us know
how Platt was involved.

12:46.064 --> 12:47.633
I wanna know why Arlen killed Joey.

12:47.718 --> 12:50.265
And I wanna know how
Pastor Janae got his gun.

12:54.978 --> 12:57.462
I wanna know how it feels to fail

12:58.414 --> 13:01.116
and be replaced by someone who
has to clean up your mess.

13:01.184 --> 13:03.485
Someone who won't get stopped for a DUI

13:03.553 --> 13:05.487
while they're in the
middle of a custody suit.

13:07.757 --> 13:10.492
Funny thing about beating your bitch ass

13:10.560 --> 13:13.662
is your threats don't faze me anymore.

13:13.730 --> 13:16.164
I'll fight you in the alley and
I'll fight you in the courtroom.

13:16.232 --> 13:20.469
Like I said, we do what we gotta do.

13:29.712 --> 13:33.548
You think that the charges against
Pastor Janae will hold up?

13:34.617 --> 13:36.685
I do.

13:36.753 --> 13:38.887
Even though they've traced
the gun back to me.

13:40.123 --> 13:42.557
They can't prove a thing.

13:51.734 --> 13:55.170
They've come in three times,
saying I can get out of here

13:55.238 --> 13:58.206
if I sign a confession.

13:58.274 --> 14:02.644
I have a master's degree, I've
counseled hundreds of people,

14:02.712 --> 14:05.514
and yet the idea of signing a confession

14:05.581 --> 14:09.551
to something I didn't do
sounds inviting.

14:11.587 --> 14:13.789
I haven't exactly seen
eye-to-eye with you

14:13.856 --> 14:17.292
on everything, but...
you don't belong here.

14:20.196 --> 14:22.497
I'm gonna get this cleared up.

14:25.468 --> 14:27.135
Keep the faith.

14:33.309 --> 14:34.509
What about your faith?

14:37.080 --> 14:38.714
What about it?

14:38.781 --> 14:41.249
Have you lost it?

14:43.586 --> 14:45.487
Barely holding on.

14:50.426 --> 14:51.593
Mind if I pray with you?

15:05.842 --> 15:11.880
Dear God, we come to you for guidance.

15:11.948 --> 15:17.552
Quite possibly, we are both,
in our own ways, incarcerated.

15:20.873 --> 15:22.624
- GIRL: Got it.
- (laughter)

15:22.731 --> 15:24.231
What are you saying?

15:24.990 --> 15:27.311
We did everything we
could to protect him.

15:29.725 --> 15:31.741
And to protect our department.

15:31.901 --> 15:33.852
And there is...

15:34.563 --> 15:37.445
some honor in that, but...

15:37.540 --> 15:39.407
There's only one course
of action, Calvert.

15:39.820 --> 15:41.576
Just keep your mouth shut.

15:41.644 --> 15:44.646
If you talk, you'll go to jail
for the rest of your life.

15:45.016 --> 15:48.289
I kept quiet because you taught me

15:48.985 --> 15:51.071
to protect our own.

15:52.755 --> 15:55.702
But Arlen Cox is not family.

15:56.926 --> 15:58.483
I was protecting him for you.

16:00.694 --> 16:04.247
- For me?
- This should never have happened.

16:04.534 --> 16:06.528
But it did.

16:07.003 --> 16:09.520
And you were
the superior officer in charge.

16:10.184 --> 16:11.606
What the hell are you saying?

16:11.950 --> 16:13.559
We need to protect each other.

16:15.611 --> 16:16.645
Calvert.

16:19.515 --> 16:22.066
(laughter)

16:28.501 --> 16:30.165
- Good evening.
- Congrats, boss.

16:30.287 --> 16:31.627
(chuckling): Thank you.

16:34.182 --> 16:38.219
Made me proud to see you graduate.

16:39.944 --> 16:41.011
Thanks for inviting me.

16:42.680 --> 16:44.615
You're a man now.

16:45.249 --> 16:46.783
I respect that.

16:47.311 --> 16:50.354
And whatever problems
that your mom and I have

16:50.421 --> 16:51.588
won't change that.

16:53.191 --> 16:55.239
You used to be my hero.

16:56.294 --> 16:59.129
Strongest guy in the
world, I used to think.

16:59.197 --> 17:01.857
But the, the minute
you became Sheriff...

17:02.433 --> 17:04.334
I was what, nine years old?

17:04.426 --> 17:07.590
See, when you were home,
if I played too loud, I was in trouble.

17:07.616 --> 17:10.044
If I cried too loud, I was in trouble.

17:10.279 --> 17:12.476
You needed everything to be so peaceful

17:12.542 --> 17:15.306
because your important job
was so stressful.

17:15.445 --> 17:19.884
I didn't choose law enforcement.
Law enforcement chose me.

17:20.818 --> 17:23.587
And it's been a blessing and a curse.

17:25.237 --> 17:27.847
If I feel myself, even for one minute,

17:28.039 --> 17:30.541
turning into you, I will
find another line of work.

17:30.624 --> 17:32.358
I guarantee you that.

17:34.686 --> 17:36.654
Thanks for the beer, Dad.

17:53.818 --> 17:55.919
(car doors close)

17:56.074 --> 17:58.019
Ms. Akino. Mr. Terry.

17:58.285 --> 18:00.496
Reed Wyatt,
Lieutenant Breeland's attorney.

18:00.725 --> 18:01.715
Why the secret meeting?

18:01.769 --> 18:03.326
My client thought about an
earlier conversation

18:03.394 --> 18:05.024
he had with Ms. Akino.

18:05.126 --> 18:07.864
He reconsidered and has now decided
to come forward with information.

18:07.889 --> 18:08.892
What kind of information?

18:08.917 --> 18:11.626
Information that could shed some light
on the murder of Joey Campbell.

18:11.688 --> 18:14.237
Unless he's giving up the actual
murderer of Joey Campbell

18:14.305 --> 18:16.873
or the details of Jesse Carr's death,
he can't help himself.

18:16.941 --> 18:18.742
He has details that can
lead to an indictment

18:18.810 --> 18:20.662
on at least one of your cases.

18:21.162 --> 18:22.857
We'll need a deal.

18:23.545 --> 18:24.881
I'm listening.

18:24.949 --> 18:26.016
House arrest.

18:26.470 --> 18:28.226
Disciplinary action
within the department

18:28.251 --> 18:29.686
is something we'd consider.

18:29.754 --> 18:31.388
- But no jail time.
- Two boys were killed.

18:31.456 --> 18:34.191
You got a hand in it
and you expect to walk?

18:34.955 --> 18:36.893
No jail time or there's no deal.

18:37.188 --> 18:38.908
- Let's go.
- Hold on.

18:42.266 --> 18:43.767
How can I get in touch?

18:53.010 --> 18:54.945
(car starts up)

19:00.078 --> 19:02.112
It's protocol.
I have to let the bosses know.

19:02.220 --> 19:04.721
Protocol? Or are you fine
letting him get away with murder?

19:04.789 --> 19:05.856
It's a negotiation.

19:05.923 --> 19:06.957
You're kidding me, right?

19:07.024 --> 19:08.825
Think about everything
he'll be giving us.

19:08.893 --> 19:10.560
Think about everything he's done.

19:10.628 --> 19:12.051
Everything he's done to me.

19:12.076 --> 19:13.697
It's not about you, it's about our case.

19:16.701 --> 19:19.311
Ashe, look, I didn't mean that, okay?

19:21.706 --> 19:23.348
Breeland's name is on all the falsified

19:23.395 --> 19:26.143
Auxiliary Deputy training records
we received from Deputy Beck.

19:26.465 --> 19:29.223
But we're in the driver's seat

19:29.293 --> 19:31.176
when it comes on
to the Joey Campbell case.

19:31.238 --> 19:32.652
We don't need Breeland to close it.

19:32.769 --> 19:35.512
<i>How can you guarantee
his testimony without making a deal?</i>

19:35.566 --> 19:36.807
We don't think we need it, sir,

19:36.832 --> 19:38.705
we've already tied the
murder weapon to Arlen Cox.

19:38.730 --> 19:40.824
<i>Which was explained
away by a theft report.</i>

19:40.892 --> 19:43.050
<i>And you need more
than just a strong hunch</i>

19:43.160 --> 19:45.708
<i>that Breeland planted that
marijuana in Jesse's glove box.</i>

19:45.888 --> 19:48.064
Frankly, sir, instead of
making a deal with Breeland,

19:48.132 --> 19:51.013
we think he should be prosecuted
alongside Arlen Cox and Sheriff Platt.

19:51.095 --> 19:52.974
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

19:53.337 --> 19:55.669
<i>You want to walk away from a dea that...</i>

19:55.895 --> 19:58.742
<i>damn sure guarantees
indictments in both cases?</i>

19:58.810 --> 20:01.560
<i>The records Beck provided you
suggest corruption.</i>

20:01.622 --> 20:03.372
<i>Breeland's testimony proves it.</i>

20:03.480 --> 20:05.048
<i>We need this win.</i>

20:06.003 --> 20:07.614
<i>The new team is already en route.</i>

20:07.684 --> 20:09.809
<i>I'm authorizing them to make
the deal with Breeland.</i>

20:09.934 --> 20:11.612
<i>Davies will wrap up the case</i>

20:11.637 --> 20:14.524
<i>and we'll see you two
back in D.C. shortly.</i>

20:14.803 --> 20:16.170
<i>Good work.</i>

20:20.665 --> 20:22.774
Remember your first game here?

20:22.967 --> 20:24.367
Yeah.

20:24.435 --> 20:26.036
They were all screaming
and yelling at you

20:26.103 --> 20:28.678
- to get that damn girl off the field.
- (chuckles)

20:29.069 --> 20:32.075
Yeah, and when the crowd got too rowdy,

20:32.143 --> 20:34.875
you came up to me and you
said, "Dad, if we win this,

20:34.919 --> 20:36.845
- they'll shut up."
- (chuckles)

20:37.615 --> 20:39.446
Too bad we got our asses kicked.

20:40.196 --> 20:43.906
It's been my proudest moment
to coach you, Tess Breeland.

20:48.960 --> 20:50.227
Dad, what's wrong?

20:55.046 --> 20:56.847
Things are gonna change a little, baby.

21:01.585 --> 21:03.296
With my job and...

21:04.075 --> 21:05.663
maybe at home.

21:05.910 --> 21:07.110
I don't understand.

21:13.150 --> 21:15.816
A week ago you called me a hero

21:16.252 --> 21:19.320
for helping those kids in the riots.

21:21.506 --> 21:23.292
But I ain't a hero.

21:25.196 --> 21:26.543
I'm far from it.

21:26.931 --> 21:28.800
Why do you keep saying that?

21:30.089 --> 21:32.903
I was on the scene the night
Joey Campbell was killed.

21:35.139 --> 21:38.190
We saw what we thought was
a drug deal going down.

21:39.310 --> 21:41.885
We chirped our siren and he ran off.

21:42.703 --> 21:44.104
So we chased after him.

21:48.786 --> 21:50.688
Did you shoot him?

21:52.037 --> 21:53.204
No.

21:55.209 --> 21:57.210
But someone else who was with us did.

21:59.530 --> 22:01.473
It should never have happened.

22:02.400 --> 22:04.832
We made a split decision to cover it up.

22:06.504 --> 22:07.871
And we left him right there.

22:11.242 --> 22:13.463
A little while later
I came back to the scene, and...

22:14.145 --> 22:16.596
he was still laying down
there on the pavement.

22:18.178 --> 22:21.000
And a crowd started to gather, so...

22:22.687 --> 22:24.321
I called it in as a homicide.

22:25.352 --> 22:26.856
You didn't mean for
that to happen, though.

22:26.891 --> 22:28.392
It wasn't your fault.

22:30.239 --> 22:31.678
Sweetheart...

22:34.298 --> 22:35.899
I gotta make this right.

22:37.952 --> 22:39.569
What does that even mean?

22:39.741 --> 22:42.567
I've been trying to blackmail
someone to cover it up.

22:47.513 --> 22:49.107
But now I'm...

22:49.818 --> 22:52.364
working on doing a deal with the DOJ.

22:53.884 --> 22:56.348
I think the other people
who I was involved with

22:56.554 --> 22:58.054
want me to take the fall.

23:02.493 --> 23:04.194
But I ain't gonna let that happen.

23:04.362 --> 23:06.065
Come here.

23:15.124 --> 23:16.708
PRESTON: Left the fax number here for you.

23:16.733 --> 23:18.465
Joey Campbell case files
are in the blue box.

23:18.832 --> 23:20.663
Jesse Carr's in the green.

23:21.676 --> 23:22.810
All right.

23:22.951 --> 23:24.678
We'll start with the Carr case.

23:24.879 --> 23:26.380
Comb through what you have then...

23:26.448 --> 23:27.881
see where we are
before we move to indict.

23:27.949 --> 23:30.384
PIERCE: You guys mind driving us around,
giving us the lay of the land?

23:30.529 --> 23:32.798
You want us to be your chauffeur?

23:33.042 --> 23:34.809
(chuckles)

23:34.870 --> 23:36.604
An escort.

23:36.671 --> 23:37.871
Is that a problem?

23:38.455 --> 23:39.853
PRESTON: Not at all.

23:46.843 --> 23:48.510
I'll get the car.

23:51.806 --> 23:54.093
PIERCE: We want a full confession
for the Joey Campbell shooting.

23:54.163 --> 23:56.229
That means identifying
all of the players...

23:56.254 --> 23:59.046
every witness, every officer,
volunteer or not,

23:59.215 --> 24:01.782
and all the people that were involved
in the cover-up that followed.

24:02.135 --> 24:03.686
My client can't speak to any of that

24:03.816 --> 24:05.085
without incriminating himself.

24:05.153 --> 24:06.775
Which is why we're offering
Lieutenant Breeland

24:06.829 --> 24:08.056
full immunity.

24:08.423 --> 24:11.384
What? No, that-that's not
the deal I discussed with him.

24:11.431 --> 24:12.826
Is everybody on board with this deal?

24:12.894 --> 24:14.461
- Yes.
- No.

24:15.540 --> 24:17.451
Ms. Pierce, can I have a word?

24:24.672 --> 24:26.140
Full immunity?

24:26.207 --> 24:27.541
That's more than what he proposed.

24:27.609 --> 24:29.042
I'm taking an aggressive stance

24:29.110 --> 24:30.532
to make sure we get full cooperation.

24:30.557 --> 24:32.379
It's not necessary. He wants to speak.

24:32.447 --> 24:33.647
PIERCE: Carroll wants a win.

24:33.715 --> 24:34.648
This guarantees it.

24:34.716 --> 24:36.283
You can have both.

24:36.585 --> 24:38.352
Since you got here, Mr. Terry,

24:38.419 --> 24:41.555
this city has rioted, a police
officer has taken his own life,

24:41.623 --> 24:43.657
and the community's distrust
for the Sheriff's Department

24:43.725 --> 24:45.292
has grown twofold.

24:45.360 --> 24:46.994
So I'd appreciate it
if you would back off

24:47.061 --> 24:49.233
and let me do the job my way.

24:58.139 --> 24:59.339
Well?

24:59.407 --> 25:01.608
Full immunity. Do we have a deal?

25:04.546 --> 25:05.746
Write it up.

25:13.553 --> 25:16.221
ASHE: So what happens when Breeland
transfers to another department

25:16.299 --> 25:17.624
and another black kid dies?

25:17.692 --> 25:19.693
This isn't what I wanted. You know that.

25:19.761 --> 25:21.595
We can't let it go down like this.

25:23.598 --> 25:25.132
What are you thinking?

25:25.200 --> 25:27.788
They're going to try to make Breeland
the star witness.

25:27.922 --> 25:29.823
We gotta get somebody
else to talk first.

25:35.043 --> 25:37.584
Weren't the parameters
made clear enough?

25:38.065 --> 25:40.600
If you want to talk to me,
contact my lawyer.

25:40.706 --> 25:42.707
Consider this a social visit.

25:43.017 --> 25:46.071
Oh... we're friends now, huh?

25:46.244 --> 25:47.516
More than you know.

25:47.590 --> 25:49.790
I confess to being intrigued.

25:50.191 --> 25:52.079
There's a new witness
who's willing to tell us

25:52.140 --> 25:53.820
everything he knows about the Tours

25:54.395 --> 25:56.495
and what happened the night
Joey Campbell was killed.

25:56.537 --> 25:58.405
None of which is my concern.

25:59.878 --> 26:02.603
Are you sure you have nothing
to get off your chest?

26:04.472 --> 26:07.397
By morning, I'm assuming
he'll name you as the shooter.

26:07.542 --> 26:10.163
And by then, it'll be too
late to save yourself.

26:16.437 --> 26:17.812
Kind of ironic.

26:18.028 --> 26:20.487
Building a prison
that may end up housing you.

26:23.442 --> 26:26.497
You could've told me you forced
Jesse's door open.

26:26.995 --> 26:29.130
I know how it is going
from zero to a hundred.

26:29.348 --> 26:31.015
Yeah, well, he went for my gun.

26:31.169 --> 26:33.694
Which is one detail that no one
seems to care about.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.427
I care.

26:35.737 --> 26:37.004
You can talk to me.

26:37.071 --> 26:38.372
I tried to talk,

26:38.694 --> 26:40.540
about the Tours,

26:40.866 --> 26:43.011
before this whole Jesse thing went down,

26:43.334 --> 26:44.868
and you told me not to.

26:45.046 --> 26:46.380
Who were you trying to protect?

26:46.438 --> 26:48.869
- Me or the department?
- I was protecting you

26:49.309 --> 26:51.495
and Kerry and those boys.

26:52.253 --> 26:55.791
What were we gonna do,
take on the whole department?

26:56.124 --> 26:57.939
Yeah, well, I'm done protecting them.

27:02.130 --> 27:03.297
I'm coming forward now.

27:13.975 --> 27:16.550
With the backlash from the department?

27:17.182 --> 27:18.949
Even more press outside your door?

27:20.515 --> 27:22.433
Doesn't matter.

27:23.718 --> 27:26.320
I got Kerry, my boys.

27:30.325 --> 27:32.359
And a bachelor party I gotta plan.

27:33.426 --> 27:34.593
Ain't all bad.

27:37.665 --> 27:39.599
Anna's dad is putting his foot down.

27:43.390 --> 27:44.957
He's threatening to cancel
the whole deal

27:45.017 --> 27:46.217
if you're at the wedding.

27:50.611 --> 27:52.683
I'm working on Anna.

27:53.715 --> 27:56.783
But... well, the video.

28:15.169 --> 28:17.147
"When Caleb and I became deputies,

28:17.538 --> 28:19.806
"we took an oath to serve and protect,

28:20.054 --> 28:23.624
"but Caleb's been doing that
since the first day we met.

28:24.979 --> 28:28.028
"Today, he took a vow
for better or for worse.

28:28.683 --> 28:33.263
"Five words used to describe
one... loyalty.

28:34.083 --> 28:36.761
"Anna, today you are
marrying my best friend,

28:36.948 --> 28:38.878
"one of the most loyal people I know,

28:39.427 --> 28:45.097
who will serve and protect you
for better or for worse."

28:49.404 --> 28:51.379
Maybe the new guy can use it.

28:58.846 --> 29:00.480
(sighs)

29:00.548 --> 29:03.216
I know how hard it is to come clean

29:03.932 --> 29:08.121
when you know that a wrong
has been committed...

29:10.314 --> 29:13.877
...especially when that wrong
has been committed by you.

29:15.163 --> 29:17.731
(clears his throat)

29:17.799 --> 29:20.686
Unfortunately, I have remained silent

29:20.757 --> 29:24.194
in the face of a terrible wrong.

29:24.672 --> 29:28.241
And today I want to free myself
of this burden.

29:31.207 --> 29:32.913
I can no longer keep silent

29:32.980 --> 29:37.504
about the death of a young
man in this community,

29:39.487 --> 29:42.893
a young man whose face, by now,

29:43.807 --> 29:44.977
we all know.

29:47.418 --> 29:49.579
<i>I...</i>

29:54.101 --> 29:56.020

30:41.360 --> 30:43.071
<i>I'm ashamed.</i>

30:44.196 --> 30:46.938
<i>I have to live with the fact that...</i>

30:47.790 --> 30:50.492
<i>a simple mistake took the life</i>

30:50.847 --> 30:53.117
<i>of a promising young man.</i>

30:55.531 --> 30:58.387
<i>Had Lieutenant Breeland
not intimidated me,</i>

30:58.750 --> 31:03.240
<i>I believe that I would have
come forward sooner.</i>

31:04.246 --> 31:06.488
<i>But as an officer sworn</i>

31:06.599 --> 31:08.435
<i>to uphold the law,</i>

31:09.049 --> 31:12.184
<i>he did in fact intimidate me</i>

31:12.844 --> 31:17.483
<i>and he should have reported the
accident to his superiors.</i>

31:17.915 --> 31:22.589
<i>He allowed for Pastor Janae Jones,</i>

31:23.212 --> 31:24.546
<i>an innocent woman,</i>

31:24.925 --> 31:27.018
<i>to be wrongfully detained.</i>

31:27.169 --> 31:30.338

something to do</i>

31:30.453 --> 31:32.251
<i>with finding my gun in her church.</i>

31:33.056 --> 31:37.659

31:44.587 --> 31:47.465
Who knew this would happen, me?
I-I didn't know this was happening.

31:48.259 --> 31:51.090
Calm down... calm the hell down.

31:51.355 --> 31:53.115
Sit down, calm down.

31:53.347 --> 31:55.582
I-I-I'm as shocked as you are.

31:55.712 --> 31:57.346
Sit down.

31:57.825 --> 32:00.198
He's placing himself in your custody!

32:00.260 --> 32:01.768
What the hell do you mean,
you're shocked?

32:01.792 --> 32:04.370

32:04.921 --> 32:06.121

32:20.466 --> 32:22.001
Derkin's gone.

32:22.142 --> 32:24.454
It's your word against Arlen's.

32:24.571 --> 32:26.583
I got your back, Calvert.

32:31.280 --> 32:33.081
Do you?

32:56.405 --> 32:57.606
When can we talk?

32:57.827 --> 32:59.997
Your info is no longer needed.

33:00.763 --> 33:02.043
What?

33:02.364 --> 33:03.857
We never presented you
with a written deal.

33:03.925 --> 33:06.482
Due to recent events,
consider it null and void.

33:13.375 --> 33:14.760
You did this.

33:23.197 --> 33:25.465
What made you decide
to come forward now?

33:25.868 --> 33:30.025
Well, actually, it was Ms. Akino
made me realize

33:30.306 --> 33:33.375
that I had the courage to speak up.

33:33.541 --> 33:35.338
Ms. Akino? When was this?

33:35.470 --> 33:36.837
Earlier today.

33:37.025 --> 33:39.247
She paid me a visit

33:39.315 --> 33:45.554

The smartest move is

How about we get all the facts

ASHE (on voice mail):

41:35.979 --> 41:39.548
Ashe, hey, call me back
as soon as you can.

(sighs)

41:42.601 --> 41:43.744
ALICIA: So what happens

41:43.778 --> 41:46.603
now that the world saw
that deputy kill my son?

41:51.883 --> 41:53.586
Look, we're still assembling
all the facts of the case.

41:53.633 --> 41:55.860
What more do you need?

41:56.125 --> 41:57.684
I really can't get into the
specifics of the case.

41:57.752 --> 41:59.486
How did the video even get leaked?

41:59.554 --> 42:02.589
I thought you had Jesse's cell phone
in your possession this entire time.

42:03.958 --> 42:06.393
Jesse's video will be
hard to overlook now.

42:12.493 --> 42:13.927
Okay, then.
