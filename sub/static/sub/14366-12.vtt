WEBVTT

00:01.514 --> 00:04.619
<i>Previously on "Transformers Prime..."</i>

00:06.121 --> 00:09.423
- Bulkhead, where is Ratchet?
- He's gone.

00:09.425 --> 00:12.793
If Megatron is truly
rebuilding the Omega lock,

00:12.795 --> 00:16.029
synthetic Energon might
be a necessary component.

00:16.030 --> 00:19.500
What did the cortical
psychic patch yield?

00:19.502 --> 00:22.302
Only that the synthetic
Energon formula is unstable.

00:22.304 --> 00:24.905
<i>If the transponder were still
attached to Laserbeak,</i>

00:24.907 --> 00:26.773
<i> - we could follow it.
- So, we're gonna let this</i>

00:26.775 --> 00:28.742
<i>doohickey fly back to 'Con central...</i>

00:28.744 --> 00:32.012
- And lead us right to Ratchet.
- You would like to see the

00:32.014 --> 00:35.349
ruins of our devastated home
world restored to their

00:35.351 --> 00:37.851
- former brilliance.
- You would just try to conquer

00:37.853 --> 00:42.400
- Cybertron all over again.
- But that does not change the fact

00:42.400 --> 00:45.623
that you may be Cybertron's only hope

00:45.695 --> 00:49.897
-  of ever seeing life again.
- I'll do it.

00:57.090 --> 01:01.840
You sure we don't need to
install a GPS on our scout here?

01:01.840 --> 01:04.970
Too risky ... both sides are
getting real good at rooting out

01:04.980 --> 01:08.506
- that kind of trick.
- Besides, we don't need a tracker.

01:08.548 --> 01:10.620
We have Optimus.

01:14.595 --> 01:16.990
But won't the 'Cons
see you coming, big guy?

01:16.990 --> 01:20.690
- Not until it's too late.
- We'll be prepared for

01:20.690 --> 01:23.020
immediate mobilization
upon your command, sir.

01:23.030 --> 01:25.160
- Good luck, Optimus.
- Be safe.

01:27.330 --> 01:29.500
Whatever the outcome,

01:29.500 --> 01:33.600
know that Ratchet would be most
proud of your contribution.

01:36.170 --> 01:39.740
Come on, kid.
Let's light this thing.

02:09.229 --> 02:11.990
Fetch me the quantum-cyber measure.

02:11.990 --> 02:17.900
Hmm.
Do I look like hired help to you, Autobot?

02:17.900 --> 02:21.270
Knockout, attend to the needs
of our esteemed guest.

02:21.270 --> 02:23.500
As you command.

02:29.820 --> 02:33.280
So, we know this cyber matter
to be produced by an atypical

02:33.280 --> 02:37.320
- molecular-displacement reaction.
- Extensive empirical evidence

02:37.320 --> 02:40.320
indicates the fundamental
instability within the Synth-En

02:40.320 --> 02:44.690
- formulation to be the cause.
- Double-blind analysis?

02:44.690 --> 02:47.530
Naturally. The
results only confirmed my original

02:47.530 --> 02:52.350
hypothesis. Once the erroneous
variable has been corrected for,

02:52.350 --> 02:57.170
the stabilized synthetic material will
bind properly with cybernucleic acid.

02:57.170 --> 03:00.740
And produce a stable
form of cyber matter.

03:00.740 --> 03:03.940
- Remarkable.
- Yes.

03:03.950 --> 03:06.910
- Quite an act of providence.
- And to think that, had we not

03:07.000 --> 03:10.850
let you destroy the beasts,
none of this would be possible.

03:10.850 --> 03:14.770
- Let?
- Uh, what I meant to say was...

03:14.820 --> 03:17.520
those specimens you requested earlier

03:17.630 --> 03:21.560
aren't going to prepare
themselves, are they?

03:22.160 --> 03:24.930
There is much to do
and little time, Doctor.

03:24.930 --> 03:27.870
- Shall we get back to work?
- Certainly.

03:42.170 --> 03:44.980
<i>Prime. Haven't heard
from you in a while.</i>

03:44.980 --> 03:46.850
<i>Everything all right up there?</i>

03:46.860 --> 03:50.220
- So far, Agent Fowler.
- What happens when the 'Cons

03:50.230 --> 03:53.340
- I.D. Laserbeak's signal?
- We're counting on Optimus

03:53.440 --> 03:56.060
making visual contact with the
warship before its radar can

03:56.160 --> 03:58.870
- detect the ship.
- The boss will be fine.

03:58.870 --> 04:01.070
It's not Optimus I'm worried about.

04:01.870 --> 04:03.143
Knockout.

04:03.157 --> 04:05.727
I require a fresh CNA sample.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.910
Ohh, I ...

04:08.910 --> 04:12.250
"Knockout, bring this.
Knockout, get that."

04:17.089 --> 04:20.550
Apparently, fetching is
all I'm good for lately.

04:20.560 --> 04:26.990
It wasn't all that long
ago I used to run this lab.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.730
Now I am everyone's gofer.

04:41.140 --> 04:45.180
- Yes?
- The ... the isoprobe!

04:45.180 --> 04:51.490
- I-I... don't see one.
- What a surprise. Ohh.

05:33.350 --> 05:36.440
Anything else?

05:38.310 --> 05:39.600
Thank you.

05:41.540 --> 05:44.010
You're welcome.

05:51.710 --> 05:56.280
We stand at the very
precipice of a new age!

05:59.720 --> 06:01.630
What do you mean, our scanners have

06:01.720 --> 06:04.680
detected Laserbeak's Signal?
Starscream.

06:05.960 --> 06:10.600
You did destroy the
Autobot base, did you not?

06:10.600 --> 06:15.600
With great fervor, my lord.
Why do you ask?

06:16.010 --> 06:21.610
Because Laserbeak's frequency
has been detected on radar.

06:21.610 --> 06:25.150
But that's not possible.
He's right here in Soundwave's torso.

06:25.150 --> 06:30.840
Which is why this would
appear to be an Autobot trick

06:30.850 --> 06:35.330
designed to uncover our position
and rescue a certain prisoner.

06:35.560 --> 06:40.140
But then one has to
wonder how would they

06:40.280 --> 06:44.160
possibly manage to
execute such a complex task

06:44.170 --> 06:47.570
- without the proper facilities!
- I, uh ...

06:47.570 --> 06:50.640
Allow me to troubleshoot.

07:09.260 --> 07:13.660
The final piece of the puzzle.

07:13.660 --> 07:18.150
Thank you, Decepticon engineering.

07:18.430 --> 07:21.921
<i>Shockwave!
Assembly of the Omega lock is</i>

07:21.921 --> 07:26.040
<i>entering the final stage.
Your guidance is required.</i>

07:26.040 --> 07:28.780
Understood, my liege.

07:28.780 --> 07:32.790
Knockout, supervise our guest
in my absence.

07:32.870 --> 07:36.480
Wow.
Thanks for the big vote of confidence.

07:39.020 --> 07:42.260
I can't allow Megatron to
possess the stabilized formula.

07:45.900 --> 07:48.900
Not now or ever.

07:56.840 --> 07:59.510
For the love of ...
what is happening?!

07:59.510 --> 08:02.200
The formula's instability ...
it must have triggered

08:02.290 --> 08:05.550
- a chain reaction!
- Guards, help me extinguish

08:05.550 --> 08:08.450
this inferno before it
scorches the project...

08:08.450 --> 08:11.160
And my finish!

08:45.450 --> 08:47.430
<i>Optimus Prime!</i>

08:48.650 --> 08:51.610
<i>How dare you continue to live?</i>

09:00.410 --> 09:04.190
<i>Blast that Autobot into oblivion!</i>

09:26.420 --> 09:28.923
The frequency isn't emanating
from Prime,

09:28.936 --> 09:31.530
and it's still on the move.

09:33.719 --> 09:35.070
Finish him!

09:35.070 --> 09:37.970
If I cannot find the source of
the signal before it finds

09:38.060 --> 09:41.630
the warship,
Megatron will have our heads!

09:46.357 --> 09:49.520
<i>Lord Megatron, uh, there
has been a situation...</i>

09:49.520 --> 09:51.880
<i>uh, more like an accident, really. I ...</i>

09:51.880 --> 09:54.310
Spit... it... out!

09:54.490 --> 09:56.116
<i>The prisoner has escaped!</i>

10:20.430 --> 10:23.800
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

10:59.520 --> 11:04.520
Not bad for an old bot.

11:09.230 --> 11:11.300
If you terminate me,

11:11.300 --> 11:14.920
you'll never get
your hands on the formula!

11:16.500 --> 11:19.740
Oh, I wouldn't be so certain, Doctor.

11:19.740 --> 11:22.970
My experts are working
diligently to disentangle your...

11:22.980 --> 11:26.110
false trail as we speak.

11:33.050 --> 11:36.810
<i>There you are.
And down you go.</i>

11:47.240 --> 11:48.670
No!

11:55.840 --> 11:58.770
Aah!
I need a ground bridge ... now!

12:14.710 --> 12:18.350
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Nice try.

12:18.440 --> 12:22.230
I'll just put this
back where it belongs.

12:23.680 --> 12:26.620
Spectrum analysis
confirms that the synthetic

12:26.740 --> 12:28.200
Energon is stable.

12:29.630 --> 12:31.600
The formula is now complete.

12:31.600 --> 12:34.080
And your timetable for production?

12:34.080 --> 12:37.920
With the aid of hyper-acceleration
technology, not long.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.810
Ohh, a pity you won't live long

12:40.810 --> 12:43.570
enough to witness the
fruits of your labor.

12:43.570 --> 12:46.770
But as much as we appreciate
your contributions, Doctor,

12:46.780 --> 12:50.860
I've made a promise to
someone that I intend to keep.

12:59.410 --> 13:03.270
<i>Do you feel defenseless, Autobot?</i>

13:06.390 --> 13:09.110
Good.
Now you know what my fellow

13:09.120 --> 13:11.080
Predacons endured...

13:11.080 --> 13:13.030
...right before you massacred them!

13:40.130 --> 13:42.300
Optimus to base ... come in.

13:42.800 --> 13:46.020
<i>Commander, have you determined
the warship's location?</i>

13:46.020 --> 13:51.080
No, Ultra Magnus.
The transponder has been destroyed.

13:51.080 --> 13:55.910
We are no closer to finding
Ratchet than when we began.

14:13.415 --> 14:16.752
<i>Lord Megatron, synthesis of
the cyber matter required to</i>

14:16.752 --> 14:21.210
- cyberform Earth has commenced.
- Splendid, Shockwave!

14:21.210 --> 14:23.640
Move the Omega lock into position.

14:23.640 --> 14:28.050
- I want to be ready.
- At last, good riddance to

14:28.050 --> 14:31.750
- a wretched species.
- Although I will say they

14:31.750 --> 14:35.390
manufacture some
fine-looking automobiles.

14:54.070 --> 14:55.320
Just get it over with.

14:55.780 --> 14:57.740
It's not like I could ever live

14:57.740 --> 14:59.840
with myself, knowing the
role I played in

14:59.950 --> 15:02.860
humankind's extinction.

15:03.180 --> 15:06.520
But if you want to avenge
your cohorts, don't stop with me!

15:06.520 --> 15:11.820
Keep avenging all the way
to Megatron!

15:14.060 --> 15:16.660
What?!
What do you mean?!

15:16.660 --> 15:20.600
Your high and mighty
leader wanted your Predacons

15:20.600 --> 15:25.870
exterminated and simply allowed
us to do his dirty work for him!

15:25.870 --> 15:28.770
Nothing but a false claim
to save your own spark!

15:28.780 --> 15:34.330
But you consider yourself an
intelligent being, don't you?!

15:35.250 --> 15:41.400
Then rise above your base instincts
and analyze the situation.

15:45.130 --> 15:47.730
We followed the trail
that day with the desperate

15:47.730 --> 15:50.330
hope that it would
lead to an Energon mine.

15:50.330 --> 15:53.970
We had no idea we would
find Shockwave's laboratory.

15:53.970 --> 15:56.470
The coincidence
barely seems plausible!

15:56.470 --> 15:58.970
Because it wasn't a coincidence.

15:58.970 --> 16:01.670
The Energon was clearly planted

16:01.670 --> 16:06.040
- to lure us there ... by Megatron!
- Hmm.

16:06.050 --> 16:09.580
Why would my liege wish to destroy us?

16:09.580 --> 16:13.580
Having just been on
the receiving end of your might,

16:13.590 --> 16:16.290
one theory springs to mind ...

16:16.300 --> 16:21.040
Megatron fears you and any like you.

16:37.250 --> 16:40.140
<i>Lord Megatron, Predaking is
on a rampage and moving rapidly</i>

16:40.150 --> 16:43.350
<i>toward the ... ohh!</i>

16:46.970 --> 16:48.520
Autobot base, do you read?

16:48.520 --> 16:50.490
<i>This is Ratchet.
Can anyone hear me?</i>

16:50.490 --> 16:53.760
- Loud and clear, old friend.
- Whoo-hoo!

16:53.760 --> 16:55.660
- Yes! Ratchet!
- I knew he was all right!

16:55.660 --> 16:58.930
<i>Listen to me ... Megatron
has managed to rebuild the</i>

16:58.930 --> 17:01.320
<i>Omega lock on board his warship.</i>

17:01.320 --> 17:04.589
I've deactivated the Decepticon
shielding system.

17:04.720 --> 17:08.290
You should be able to get a fix
on my coordinates.

17:08.740 --> 17:11.380
Optimus, you must hurry!

17:11.380 --> 17:16.250
Megatron is preparing to
cyberform Earth as we speak!

17:19.119 --> 17:21.579
Ratchet...

17:22.099 --> 17:26.119
Autobots, lock on to those
coordinates and prepare

17:26.359 --> 17:29.990
- to storm the warship.
- You heard our leader.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.430
We're going in, and
we're going in heavy.

17:32.430 --> 17:35.370
Gear up.

17:48.280 --> 17:50.720
They can't leave
without saying goodbye.

17:50.720 --> 17:53.150
No time for that, and no need.

17:53.150 --> 17:55.620
- They'll be back.
- Initiating groundbridge.

17:59.210 --> 18:01.590
<i>Members of team Prime,</i>

18:01.590 --> 18:06.600
<i>Autobot and human, it has
been my honor to lead you.</i>

18:06.600 --> 18:11.100
<i>On this day, the fates of two
worlds hang in the balance, and</i>

18:11.100 --> 18:15.440
<i>the battle to come may
very well be our last.</i>

18:15.440 --> 18:21.790
<i>But for Earth, for Cybertron,
for our comrade, Ratchet,</i>

18:21.820 --> 18:26.670
<i> we must take the Decepticon warship.</i>

18:28.650 --> 18:32.460
Are you sure confronting the
beast-bot directly is the best

18:32.460 --> 18:37.530
- option, lord Megatron?
- We shall see how his majesty

18:37.530 --> 18:40.720
fares against the most
powerful weapon in our vault ...

18:40.780 --> 18:43.030
the Dark Star Saber!

18:50.540 --> 18:54.210
- Megatron!
- I'll just go fetch that

18:54.210 --> 18:56.010
little something we talked about.

18:56.020 --> 19:00.020
Is it true that you ordered
the annihilation of my army?!

19:00.020 --> 19:02.840
Indeed,
and my only mistake was not

19:02.840 --> 19:05.660
seeing the extermination through.

19:22.140 --> 19:26.710
- Aah!
- I will tear you apart!

19:35.050 --> 19:36.480
I ...

19:53.750 --> 19:55.840
That's the spirit.

19:55.840 --> 19:59.280
But I was a champion
of the pits of Kaon not

19:59.280 --> 20:04.850
only due to my savage
might... but also my cunning!

20:13.630 --> 20:17.660
You should have heeded my
advice and faced me as a beast.

20:35.170 --> 20:39.660
Bravo, my liege. It isn't
every day one witnesses

20:39.660 --> 20:42.850
the extinction of a
species all over again.

20:42.850 --> 20:45.730
One ultimate weapon coming right up.

20:46.040 --> 20:49.240
Uh, where's tall, dark, and scaly?

20:49.430 --> 20:52.060
<i>- Report.
- Lord Megatron, the ship is</i>

20:52.060 --> 20:57.000
- under attack ... by the Autobots.
- But the warship is cloaked.

20:57.000 --> 21:02.010
- How is that possible?
- The medic lives!

21:02.010 --> 21:04.780
Mobilize what remains of our forces!

21:04.780 --> 21:08.510
The Omega lock must be
defended at all costs!

21:09.400 --> 21:11.850
<i>If Optimus Prime wishes to wage</i>

21:11.850 --> 21:17.120
<i>a battle for the fate of
both Earth and Cybertron...</i>

21:17.120 --> 21:19.770
then I shall oblige him.

21:19.880 --> 21:25.030
This will be our last stand!
