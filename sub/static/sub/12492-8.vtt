I WAS TO BE CARRYING
MY LITTLE BUNDLE OF JOY.

01:47.541 --> 01:51.245

IT'S WORSE.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.435

04:19.727 --> 04:21.429
I'm in the middle

04:21.462 --> 04:23.497
WOULD YOU PLEASE
JUST CALM DOWN?

04:23.531 --> 04:25.733
I'VE DONE THIS

04:25.766 --> 04:28.536
AND JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR,
THERE WILL NOT BE A FIFTH.

04:28.569 --> 04:30.638

I DON'T KNOW, SON.
WHY DON'T YOU ASK HIM?

06:04.865 --> 06:07.701
- HOW DO WE GET HIM OUT?
- WE DON'T.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.603
HE'S THE BEAR.
HE MAKES THE DECISIONS.

06:09.637 --> 06:12.139
DAD, YOU'RE AN EXTERMINATOR.
YOU SHOULD DEAL WITH THIS.

06:12.172 --> 06:16.176
I WILL--
WHEN HE LOSES 600 LBS
AND FITS IN A MOUSETRAP.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.145
HOW ARE WE GONNA GET

06:18.178 --> 06:20.914
START WALKING.

I'M FRANKENSTEIN

IT'S FOR A PLAY I WROTE.

06:52.012 --> 06:54.448
I DON'T GET IT.

06:54.482 --> 06:56.817
NEITHER DID THE AUDIENCE.

06:56.850 --> 06:59.587
WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?
NO, THE KIDS LOVED IT.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.555
ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR FLAT HEAD?

07:01.589 --> 07:03.223
IT WAS A DISASTER.

07:03.256 --> 07:07.461
- THEN WHY WERE THEY CHEERING?
- BECAUSE WE HAD TO LEAVE EARLY.

07:07.495 --> 07:10.598

AMY DUNCAN.

07:10.631 --> 07:11.965

( moans )

07:22.042 --> 07:24.878

- HI, FRANKENSTEIN.

07:24.912 --> 07:27.247
HI-- ( groans )

07:27.280 --> 07:30.884
I HAD THE SAME REACTION
WHEN I SAW THIS WIG.

07:30.918 --> 07:34.522
CONTRACTION.
( exhales )

07:34.555 --> 07:36.924
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- SUPER, GREAT.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.527
COULDN'T BE BETTER.
ALL MY DUCKS ARE IN A ROW

07:39.560 --> 07:41.629
AND EVERYTHING'S
UNDER CONTROL.

07:41.662 --> 07:43.664
SO WHERE'S GABE?

07:43.697 --> 07:46.667
I GUESS I LEFT
ONE OF MY DUCKS AT HOME.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.736
WAIT, GABE'S HOME ALONE?

07:48.769 --> 07:51.038
OH, THAT IS NOT GOOD.

07:53.541 --> 07:55.275
GABE, YOU OKAY?

07:55.308 --> 07:57.811

08:11.559 --> 08:15.028
HEY HEY, ANYBODY HERE?

08:17.565 --> 08:20.000
- DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- P.J., WE'VE GOT TO GET
TO THE HOSPITAL.

08:20.033 --> 08:22.536
I'M JUST GONNA SEE IF I CAN
HOTWIRE ONE OF THESE THINGS.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.938
- UH, DAD!
- YOU TRYING TO STEAL OUR BIKES?

08:28.942 --> 08:31.879
NOT STEAL-- HOTWIRE.

08:31.912 --> 08:34.948
NO, LOOK LOOK LOOK,
BEFORE YOU DO SOMETHING
YOU MIGHT REGRET,

08:34.982 --> 08:37.317
THERE IS A PERFECTLY GOOD
EXPLANATION.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.720
AND I'D LOVE TO HEAR IT...

08:39.753 --> 08:42.122
RIGHT AFTER I GUT YOU
LIKE A FISH.

08:44.892 --> 08:48.996
YOU WANT YOUR BIG KNIFE
OR YOUR REALLY BIG KNIFE?

08:49.930 --> 08:51.932
SURPRISE ME.

09:04.745 --> 09:08.015
BOY, CHARLIE'S REALLY
LOVING HER BIRTHDAY CAKE.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.050
I KNOW.
ISN'T IT ADORABLE?

09:12.085 --> 09:15.856
WHEN SHE DOES IT IT'S ADORABLE.
WHEN I DO IT IT'S WRONG.

09:15.889 --> 09:19.827
AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE WERE
AT A RESTAURANT AND IT
WASN'T YOUR CAKE.

09:22.362 --> 09:24.732
COME ON, LET'S GET BACK
TO THE STORY.

09:24.765 --> 09:27.601
DID THE BIKERS GUT YOU
LIKE A FISH?

09:27.635 --> 09:30.938
- YOU WERE THERE.
- OH, RIGHT.

09:32.773 --> 09:35.075
ALL RIGHT, ANYWAY,
BIKERS WERE COMING ON STRONG,

09:35.108 --> 09:37.711
I HAD TO COME BACK STRONGER.

09:37.745 --> 09:39.980
PLEASE DON'T HURT US.
PLEASE DON'T HURT US.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.982
GIVE US ONE GOOD REASON
WHY WE SHOULDN'T.

09:42.015 --> 09:44.718
BECAUSE IT WOULD HURT.

09:44.752 --> 09:46.887
LOOK LOOK LOOK,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

09:46.920 --> 09:50.791
MY WIFE IS HAVING A BABY
AND THERE'S A BEAR IN OUR TRUCK.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.727
THAT'S WHY I'M TRYING
TO BORROW THE BIKE.

09:53.761 --> 09:56.630
I CAN'T-- I CAN'T MISS
THE BIRTH OF MY CHILD.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.767

09:59.800 --> 10:01.669
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

10:01.702 --> 10:06.139

OH, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH

10:18.819 --> 10:20.754
I'M FRANCIS.
SHE'S MAD DOG.

10:22.189 --> 10:25.793
MY REAL NAME'S SHIRLEY.
IF YOU CALL ME THAT...

10:25.826 --> 10:27.160
YOU'LL GUT HIM
LIKE A FISH?

10:28.696 --> 10:31.031
YOU CATCH ON REAL FAST.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.835
( groaning )

10:34.868 --> 10:37.137
MRS. D., CAN YOU KEEP IT
DOWN A LITTLE BIT?

10:37.170 --> 10:39.039
I'M TRYING TO WIN
CONCERT TICKETS.

10:40.908 --> 10:43.110
WHERE IS HE?
I'M STARTING TO GET WORRIED.

10:43.143 --> 10:46.213
OKAY, MOM, RELAX.
I'M SURE DAD'S GOING

10:46.246 --> 10:48.949
DAD?!
WHO CARES ABOUT DAD?

10:48.982 --> 10:50.818
I'M TALKING
ABOUT DR. SINGH.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.820
HE'S DELIVERED
ALL MY CHILDREN.

10:52.853 --> 10:55.956
AND, LADY, I AM NOT HAVING
THIS BABY WITHOUT HIM.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.693
FRANKENSTEIN, CAN I TALK
TO YOU A MINUTE?

10:59.727 --> 11:01.128
YEP.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.936

11:08.969 --> 11:12.873
NOT AT ALL.
HE'S TAKING A PERSONAL DAY.
IT'S HIS SON'S BIRTHDAY.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.842
SO YOU MEAN HE'S
NOT GONNA BE HERE.

11:14.875 --> 11:19.079
LOOK, I KNOW YOU HAVE
SOMEONE ELSE'S BRAIN
INSIDE YOUR HEAD,

11:19.112 --> 11:22.115

WE'LL JUST DO THIS TOMORROW
WHEN DR. SINGH CAN BE HERE.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.155

HOW IT WORKS, MRS. D.

12:02.189 --> 12:04.291

12:49.169 --> 12:52.539
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO OPEN
THE DOOR TO STRANGERS.

12:52.572 --> 12:56.009
I WISH WE WERE STRANGERS.
LET ME IN.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.983
WHAT IS GOING ON IN HERE?

13:03.016 --> 13:05.819
JUST THE BEST DAY
OF MY LIFE.

13:05.853 --> 13:09.957
PARTY'S OVER.
YOUR SISTER CALLED AND ASKED ME
TO BRING YOU TO THE HOSPITAL.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.591
NO WAY.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.593
I'M NOT GOING JUST
TO SEE SOME STUPID BABY

13:13.626 --> 13:15.963
WHO I DON'T EVEN WANT
ANYWAY.

13:15.996 --> 13:18.966
I SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.
HAVE A SEAT.

13:18.999 --> 13:21.935
I'M GONNA TELL YOU A STORY.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.041
WHEN I WAS FOUR,
I GOT A BABY SISTER.

13:28.075 --> 13:30.944
HATED THAT GIRL
FROM THE FIRST MINUTE
I LAID EYES ON HER.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.312
I USED TO PULL HER HAIR

13:32.345 --> 13:35.949
AND CALL HER NAMES
AND TEASE HER TILL SHE CRIED.

13:35.983 --> 13:39.086
BUT WE GREW UP AND ONE THING
LED TO ANOTHER

13:39.119 --> 13:42.289
AND AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
I STILL CAN'T STAND HER.

13:42.322 --> 13:45.225
HOW IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?

13:45.258 --> 13:47.294
I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS GOING
TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.396
I SAID I WAS GOING
TO TELL YOU A STORY.

13:49.429 --> 13:51.932
NOW TAKE THAT HELMET OFF
AND LET'S GO.

13:55.302 --> 13:59.239
- WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR HEAD?
- GAVE MYSELF A HAIRCUT.

13:59.272 --> 14:02.175
- YOU LIKE IT?
- I WANT IT DOCUMENTED

14:02.209 --> 14:04.411
THAT THAT HAPPENED
BEFORE I GOT HERE.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.088
WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT,
NO, HEY HEY.

14:15.122 --> 14:18.892
- ALL RIGHT, TIME OUT.
- DR. SINGH?

14:18.926 --> 14:21.328
OH, IT'S ABOUT TIME.
I--

14:21.361 --> 14:24.231
WAIT A MINUTE.
I ORDERED BATMAN.

14:24.264 --> 14:27.034
NOT FRANKENSTEIN
AND... GOLDILOCKS?

14:27.067 --> 14:29.903
CLOSE ENOUGH.

14:29.937 --> 14:32.272
NO, WE'RE NOT
HERE FOR THE PARTY.
YOU DELIVERED ME.

14:32.305 --> 14:35.242
I THINK I WOULD HAVE
REMEMBERED THAT.

14:35.275 --> 14:38.178
I'M TEDDY,
AMY DUNCAN'S DAUGHTER.
SHE'S ABOUT TO GIVE BIRTH

14:38.211 --> 14:40.280
- AND NEEDS YOU AT THE HOSPITAL.
- I CAN'T LEAVE.

14:40.313 --> 14:43.350
I HAVE TO STAY HERE AND ENJOY
MY SON'S BIRTHDAY.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.020
WHO THREW THAT?
WAS IT YOU, TYLER?

14:47.054 --> 14:50.257
OR THE OTHER TYLER?

14:50.290 --> 14:51.424
NO NO NO NO NO.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.692
NO NO NO.

14:52.725 --> 14:56.196
HOW ABOUT WE
MAKE A DEAL, OKAY?

14:56.229 --> 14:58.331
IF YOU GO TO THE HOSPITAL
AND TAKE CARE OF MY MOM,

14:58.365 --> 15:00.433
THEN WE'LL STAY HERE
AND ENTERTAIN THE KIDS.

15:00.467 --> 15:03.403
- AND HOW ARE WE GONNA DO THAT?
- WE'LL DO MY PLAY FOR THEM.

15:03.436 --> 15:06.339
OH, IT'S A DELIGHTFUL FABLE
ABOUT PEOPLE FROM
DIFFERENT WORLDS

15:06.373 --> 15:09.943
WHO OVERCOME
THEIR DIFFERENCES
AND BECOME FRIENDS.

15:09.977 --> 15:13.113
I GIVE IT TWO THUMBS UP.
GOOD LUCK.

15:14.714 --> 15:17.117
HEY, KIDS, WHO WANTS
TO SEE A PLAY, HUH?

15:17.150 --> 15:19.386
THAT IS A YES FROM TYLER.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.357
HEY!

15:24.391 --> 15:26.960
IF GRETEL GETS HIT
WITH A FOOTBALL,

15:26.994 --> 15:29.997
THERE'S GONNA BE ONE LESS
TYLER AT THIS PARTY.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.709
THIS SHOULD BE GOOD.

15:42.742 --> 15:45.145
WE JUST DROVE 40 MILES
BEHIND A TRUCK

15:45.178 --> 15:48.148
LOADED WITH LIVE CHICKENS
ON MOTORCYCLES.

15:48.181 --> 15:52.119
THE CHICKENS WEREN'T
ON MOTORCYCLES.
WE WERE.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.988
- YOU MUST BE THE DUNCANS.
- HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

15:55.022 --> 15:57.057
WILD GUESS.
IN THERE.

15:57.090 --> 16:00.393
OH, UH, THANKS
FOR DROPPING US OFF.
WE CAN HANDLE IT FROM HERE.

16:00.427 --> 16:03.363
OH, WE CAN'T LEAVE NOW.
WE'RE EMOTIONALLY INVESTED.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.498
AND I NEED TO GRAB
A QUICK SHOWER.

16:05.532 --> 16:07.434
SHE'S NOT KIDDING.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.439
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
THREW UP IN MY CAR.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.442
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?

16:15.475 --> 16:18.445
FOR LUNCH I ATE
TWO CANS OF FROSTING.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.780
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR AMY DUNCAN.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.116
WE KNOW THE DUNCANS.

16:24.417 --> 16:27.054
GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.324
- I LIKE YOUR HAIR.
- THANKS.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.293
I LIKE YOUR SCAR.

16:39.432 --> 16:43.536
HELLO, IS ANYONE HOME
IN THIS GINGERBREAD HOUSE?

16:43.570 --> 16:46.206
( moaning )

16:48.841 --> 16:50.810
FRANKENSTEIN?

16:50.843 --> 16:54.114
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN GERMAN SWITZERLAND?

16:57.484 --> 17:01.288
ME WANT FRIEND.

17:01.321 --> 17:04.491
BUT HOW CAN A BIG
MONSTER LIKE YOU

17:04.524 --> 17:09.496
BE FRIENDS WITH A SWEET
LITTLE PEASANT GIRL LIKE ME?

17:10.630 --> 17:13.566
IT'S POSSIBLE.
IF YOU BELIEVE

17:13.600 --> 17:17.337
WE CAN BE FRIENDS,
CLAP HANDS.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.108
CLAP HANDS!

17:22.509 --> 17:24.511
LIKE THIS!

17:26.346 --> 17:27.580
T, GIVE IT UP.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.449
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
STICK TO THE SCRIPT.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.451
LOOK AT THEM.
THEY'RE BORED SILLY.
LET'S JUST STOP.

17:31.484 --> 17:35.155
NO, WE CAN'T.
FRANKENSTEIN HASN'T FOUND
THE COURAGE TO CRY YET.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.559
SORRY, FRANKIE,
GRETEL'S TAKING OVER.

17:42.129 --> 17:45.532
HEY, KIDS, WHO WANTS
TO PLAY PIN THE TAIL
ON THE FRANKENSTEIN?

17:45.565 --> 17:47.400
All:
ME ME ME!

17:51.504 --> 17:53.506
THAT'S A PICTURE
OF OUR SON HOG.

17:53.540 --> 17:56.376
HIS NAME'S HOG?

17:56.409 --> 17:59.512
IT WAS.
HE CHANGED IT TO KEVIN.

18:01.148 --> 18:03.416
THE BOY'S BEEN A REAL
DISAPPOINTMENT.

18:03.450 --> 18:06.619
- IS HE LIKE A CRIMINAL
OR SOMETHING?
- WORSE.

18:06.653 --> 18:10.089
VICE PRESIDENT
OF MARKETING.

18:11.924 --> 18:15.195
- FIRST BABY?
- THAT OBVIOUS, HUH?

18:15.228 --> 18:18.898
( chuckles )
HEY, I'VE BEEN THERE.

18:18.931 --> 18:22.202
- YOU HAVE?
- OH YEAH.

18:22.235 --> 18:25.605
- THIS IS MY THIRD TIME
SITTING IN THESE CHAIRS.
- WOW.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.674
IF YOU DON'T MIND
MY ASKING,

18:27.707 --> 18:31.144
- HOW OLD WERE YOU
THE FIRST TIME?
- TWO.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.549
- HAS MOM GIVEN BIRTH YET?
- NOPE.

18:36.583 --> 18:40.187
- HEY, TEDDY.
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HAIR?

18:40.220 --> 18:42.555
I'M CONDITIONING.

18:44.491 --> 18:45.625
YOU'RE TEDDY?

18:45.658 --> 18:47.627
YOU'RE EXACTLY LIKE
GABE DESCRIBED YOU.

18:52.465 --> 18:56.336
HEY, KIDS, COME ON.
THERE'S SOMEBODY
I WANT YOU TO MEET.

19:03.943 --> 19:06.246
( whispers )
HI.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.482
COME IN, COME IN.

19:15.488 --> 19:18.558
SAY HELLO TO YOUR NEW
BABY SISTER, EVERYBODY.

19:18.591 --> 19:21.661
HER NAME IS CHARLOTTE.
DO YOU WANT TO
HOLD HER, TEDDY?

19:21.694 --> 19:23.696
- CAN I?
- OF COURSE.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.706
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.976
HI THERE.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.479
NICE TO MEET YOU.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.449
AND I DON'T USUALLY
LOOK LIKE THIS.

19:46.386 --> 19:49.656
I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAVE
A BABY SISTER.

19:49.689 --> 19:52.625
WOULD YOU MIND
TAKING A PICTURE?

19:52.659 --> 19:53.760
THANK YOU.

19:56.263 --> 19:58.631
- WHAT'S THE BABY'S NAME?
- CHARLOTTE.

19:58.665 --> 20:02.001
- MAMA, CAN WE CALL HER CHARLIE?
- CHARLIE!

20:02.034 --> 20:05.705
- OH, I LOVE IT.
- ( laughs )

20:05.738 --> 20:07.507
QUITE A FAMILY YOU GOT THERE.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.409
GOOD LUCK, CHARLIE.

20:14.781 --> 20:17.717
- SWEETIE, I JUST
LOVE THIS PRESENT.
- OH, THANKS, MOM.

20:17.750 --> 20:21.621
BUT TO BE FAIR,
P.J. AND GABE SET
THE BAR PRETTY LOW.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.390
- WHAT?!
- HEY.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.492
( doorbell rings )

20:28.728 --> 20:30.497
SURPRISE.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.765
OH, MAD DOG, FRANCIS,

20:32.799 --> 20:34.467
COME ON IN.

20:34.501 --> 20:36.469
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?

20:36.503 --> 20:39.672
WE HAVE A BIRTHDAY PRESENT
FOR OUR GODDAUGHTER.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.544
- WHOO-HOO!
- OHHH.

20:44.577 --> 20:47.414
A BABY BIKER VEST.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.482
LET'S TRY IT ON.

20:50.617 --> 20:53.586
THAT'S SO CUTE.
I LOVE IT.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.688
- DID YOU ASK THEM
TO BE THE GODPARENTS?
- OF COURSE NOT.

20:55.722 --> 20:58.291
THEN YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM
THAT THEY ARE NOT
THE GODPARENTS.

20:58.325 --> 20:59.526
NO THANK YOU.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.561
FINE, I'LL DO IT.

21:01.594 --> 21:04.797
EXCUSE ME.
THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

21:08.335 --> 21:10.737
OH, WELCOME TO THE FAMILY.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.508
GUYS, CHECK IT OUT.

21:15.542 --> 21:18.445
- OHHH!
- CUTIE.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.528
- I KNOW I HEARD SOMETHING.
- ( rattling )

21:35.562 --> 21:37.797
I THINK IT'S COMING
FROM THE KITCHEN.

21:37.830 --> 21:40.333
OKAY, YOU WAIT HERE.

21:40.367 --> 21:42.502
OR I COULD HIDE UPSTAIRS.

21:50.443 --> 21:53.613
( roars )

21:53.646 --> 21:56.483
YOU'RE HERE FOR
THE EGG SALAD, AREN'T YOU?

21:58.751 --> 22:01.521
OKAY, SIT DOWN.

22:04.391 --> 22:07.427
YOU BRING BACK
MY TRUCK?

22:07.460 --> 22:10.563
- FULL TANK OF GAS?
- ( groans )

22:11.798 --> 22:13.666
WHAT, WERE YOU RAISED
IN A CAVE?
