- What made you decide to come
and decide to marry a stranger?

1:01:31.679 --> 1:01:33.263
- I don't have a problem
meeting women.

1:01:33.347 --> 1:01:36.024
My friends call me
Facebook Crook

1:01:36.183 --> 1:01:37.517
because they just, like,
usually ask,

1:01:37.601 --> 1:01:38.777
"How do meet these girls?"

1:01:38.861 --> 1:01:41.113
"Through Facebook,"
and you meet somebody,

1:01:41.197 --> 1:01:44.116
they put on this persona
on the internet,

1:01:44.275 --> 1:01:46.118
and you meet them, and you're
like, "Wow, this is nobody

1:01:46.202 --> 1:01:47.944
"who I--this is like
'Catfish, ' almost.

1:01:48.028 --> 1:01:49.371
You just look
like that person."

1:01:49.455 --> 1:01:51.114
- Yeah.
- So in my past,

1:01:51.207 --> 1:01:53.458
I'll be honest with you guys,
I haven't been honest.

1:01:53.543 --> 1:01:55.460
<i>[tense music]</i>

1:01:55.545 --> 1:01:57.212
In college, I had, like,
multiple names.

1:01:57.296 --> 1:01:58.880
They used to call me Isaac

1:01:58.965 --> 1:02:01.049
because that's how much I was
running around and whatever.

1:02:01.208 --> 1:02:02.384
- Yeah.
- And you can't get caught

1:02:02.543 --> 1:02:03.626
if you have different
identities.

1:02:03.720 --> 1:02:05.462
[laughter]

1:02:05.546 --> 1:02:07.055
- I feel like guys
with girlfriends

1:02:07.140 --> 1:02:08.798
always try and talk to me.

1:02:08.883 --> 1:02:10.642
I always find out
they have a girlfriend.

1:02:10.727 --> 1:02:13.052
I was dating this guy,
and everything was,

1:02:13.137 --> 1:02:14.563
like, going good.

1:02:14.722 --> 1:02:17.315
And then my intuition
or something

1:02:17.400 --> 1:02:19.726
tapped me on the shoulder,
like, "Find his Facebook."

1:02:19.810 --> 1:02:22.904
Come to find out, he's in
a nine-year relationship.

1:02:22.989 --> 1:02:25.648
He got this other girl
and then me.

1:02:25.733 --> 1:02:28.151
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, so...

1:02:28.235 --> 1:02:29.569
I'm like,
"What is going on here?

1:02:29.653 --> 1:02:31.329
"Does it say, like,
'side chick' on my forehead?

1:02:31.414 --> 1:02:34.750
Because I'm not
signing up for this."

1:02:34.834 --> 1:02:36.084
- I'm really gonna
put in a effort.

1:02:36.243 --> 1:02:38.420
This is the most
I've ever put into...

1:02:38.579 --> 1:02:39.662
- A relationship?
- Meeting somebody.

1:02:39.747 --> 1:02:40.839
Yes. A relationship.
- That's good, man.

1:02:40.998 --> 1:02:41.923
- You gotta mature.

1:02:42.008 --> 1:02:43.082
I'm at that level
in my life, man.

1:02:43.176 --> 1:02:44.259
It's time for me to settle down,

1:02:44.418 --> 1:02:45.502
find me
a old good girl, you know?

1:02:45.595 --> 1:02:47.003
- Yeah.

1:02:47.087 --> 1:02:48.430
- You know, this is
a beautiful opportunity

1:02:48.589 --> 1:02:50.340
to meet the love of your life.
It's huge.

1:02:50.424 --> 1:02:52.008
- And for you, too, to, like,

1:02:52.101 --> 1:02:53.760
like--like--like you just said,
be vulnerable...

1:02:53.853 --> 1:02:55.103
- Yeah, I'm being
very vulnerable.

1:02:55.262 --> 1:02:56.354
- To, like--to go all in...
- Yes. 100%.

1:02:56.439 --> 1:02:57.522
- And be like,
"This is-this is who O is."

1:02:57.607 --> 1:02:58.774
- Yes.

1:02:58.933 --> 1:03:00.192
<i>- So when it comes to Olajuwon,</i>

1:03:00.276 --> 1:03:01.777
he's the youngest one
out of the bunch,

1:03:01.936 --> 1:03:03.853
<i>so I hope he has done the growth</i>

1:03:03.938 --> 1:03:05.363
<i>that he's talking about</i>

1:03:05.448 --> 1:03:07.774
<i>so that he's ready
for--for this relationship.</i>

1:03:07.858 --> 1:03:10.869
But if not, you know,
that could be problematic.

1:03:10.953 --> 1:03:12.862
- Like, what was
your last relationship like?

1:03:12.947 --> 1:03:16.625
- So me and my ex, we dated
for 2 1/2 years.

1:03:16.709 --> 1:03:19.702
And he--I was making him dinner,

1:03:19.796 --> 1:03:23.790
and he came home from work
and broke up with me...

1:03:23.883 --> 1:03:26.384
- Oh, my God.
- Out of nowhere.

1:03:26.544 --> 1:03:27.886
- That's the worst.

1:03:27.970 --> 1:03:31.297
- So I got out of that
and realized, like,

1:03:31.390 --> 1:03:32.808
I just want to find my person,

1:03:32.892 --> 1:03:34.810
and I started saying
it out loud.

1:03:34.969 --> 1:03:36.636
Like,
"I want to find my husband.

1:03:36.729 --> 1:03:38.137
I don't want to date anymore.

1:03:38.231 --> 1:03:40.315
Like, please bring me my guy."

1:03:40.474 --> 1:03:42.984
And I would say it
every single day, and...

1:03:43.143 --> 1:03:45.403
- Did you make a list?
- Here I am.

1:03:45.488 --> 1:03:47.063
- I've been in
multiple relationships

1:03:47.147 --> 1:03:48.657
going all the way back
to college

1:03:48.816 --> 1:03:49.899
that were multiple years,
most of the time.

1:03:49.992 --> 1:03:51.067
- Yeah.

1:03:51.151 --> 1:03:52.244
- So I'd date a girl for a year,

1:03:52.328 --> 1:03:53.653
date a girl for two years,
three years.

1:03:53.746 --> 1:03:55.163
I was looking for long-term,

1:03:55.248 --> 1:03:56.656
but I never found
the right person.

1:03:56.740 --> 1:03:58.166
- I'm the type of person
where I can't date someone

1:03:58.251 --> 1:03:59.909
for, like, a long period of time

1:04:00.002 --> 1:04:01.911
if it's not gonna go
down--down to marriage.

1:04:01.996 --> 1:04:03.496
- I'm the opposite.
- Yeah.

1:04:03.581 --> 1:04:05.340
See, like, I meet people.
I'm like, "How long you--

1:04:05.424 --> 1:04:06.424
"You had, like, two-, three-,
or four-year relationships.

1:04:06.584 --> 1:04:07.759
How do you do that?"

1:04:07.844 --> 1:04:09.010
Like, after, like,
six to eight months,

1:04:09.169 --> 1:04:10.420
I'm like, "We gotta
get a place together.

1:04:10.504 --> 1:04:12.597
"I ain't packing a bag.
I don't want a pen pal.

1:04:12.682 --> 1:04:13.590
"Like, how many times we gonna
hook up to realize,

1:04:13.674 --> 1:04:14.599
like, I want to be with you?"

1:04:14.758 --> 1:04:16.101
- Mark the Shark's wife

1:04:16.260 --> 1:04:18.103
is gonna have to be ready

1:04:18.262 --> 1:04:20.597
<i>for someone who wears
their heart on their sleeve,</i>

1:04:20.690 --> 1:04:24.192
<i>someone who's aggressive,
someone that is no BS.</i>

1:04:24.351 --> 1:04:26.769
So I hope that
she's able to see that

1:04:26.863 --> 1:04:29.105
and see it as a positive
as opposed to something

1:04:29.189 --> 1:04:32.117
that's, like--
Makes her nervous.

1:04:32.201 --> 1:04:34.944
So I think I'm on
the opposite end of you.

1:04:35.037 --> 1:04:37.122
I am picky, to where, like,
I'll meet someone.

1:04:37.281 --> 1:04:38.623
They're great.
- Yeah.

1:04:38.708 --> 1:04:40.283
- And I'll find, like,
one little thing...

1:04:40.376 --> 1:04:41.618
- Okay.

1:04:41.711 --> 1:04:43.461
- Where I'm like,
"Oh, this isn't gonna work."

1:04:43.621 --> 1:04:45.213
- So how are you gonna--
How is this gonna work for you?

1:04:45.372 --> 1:04:47.040
- "You ordered your steak
which way?"

1:04:47.133 --> 1:04:48.216
- Yeah.
- "Check, please."

1:04:48.375 --> 1:04:50.126
- Like, "Who cuts food
like that?"

1:04:50.210 --> 1:04:52.971
- Right.
- "Left-handed? No."

1:04:53.055 --> 1:04:54.389
- I don't know what
it's gonna be with Mike.

1:04:54.473 --> 1:04:55.548
I'm dying to hear
what the things

1:04:55.641 --> 1:04:57.550
that he picks--picks apart.

1:04:57.635 --> 1:04:58.894
<i>I feel like, with Mike,</i>

1:04:59.053 --> 1:05:01.730
<i>he might like somebody
really outgoing,</i>

1:05:01.889 --> 1:05:03.056
<i>because it might help him
get out--</i>

1:05:03.149 --> 1:05:04.816
I don't know if he's in a shell,

1:05:04.901 --> 1:05:06.559
where he's shy
and quiet and reserved.

1:05:06.652 --> 1:05:08.236
- With this process...
- Yeah.

1:05:08.395 --> 1:05:10.647
- It's kind of for me
to prove to myself--

1:05:10.731 --> 1:05:12.148
- It forces you...
- Exactly.

1:05:12.232 --> 1:05:12.982
- To stay in the situation
no matter what.

1:05:13.075 --> 1:05:14.067
- Exactly.

1:05:14.160 --> 1:05:15.485
- I never thought that I would

1:05:15.569 --> 1:05:17.162
be doing something like this.

1:05:17.321 --> 1:05:21.991
I'm pretty private when
it comes to my personal life.

1:05:22.076 --> 1:05:23.910
But I'm just, like--
- I'm getting that sense.

1:05:23.994 --> 1:05:25.754
- I realize,
with my past relationships,

1:05:25.838 --> 1:05:29.090
I've always dated men who were,
like, emotionally unavailable.

1:05:29.175 --> 1:05:31.000
- Yeah.
- And--

1:05:31.085 --> 1:05:32.335
- They're the worst.
- Yeah.

1:05:32.428 --> 1:05:35.421
I just always felt like
I was always that girl

1:05:35.506 --> 1:05:38.758
that men had to go through
to get it right.

1:05:38.842 --> 1:05:40.760
- Oh! So you were the person
to fix them.

1:05:40.844 --> 1:05:43.846
- Yeah.
<i>- I mean, Jasmina is stunning.</i>

1:05:43.940 --> 1:05:46.358
She captures your breath
when she walks in a room.

1:05:46.442 --> 1:05:48.526
And she's, like,
also my co-pink princess.

1:05:48.611 --> 1:05:51.104
So, Jasmina...

1:05:51.197 --> 1:05:53.782
I just think she's a knockout.

1:05:53.866 --> 1:05:57.527
Ooh! I know 100% that when her
husband walks down the aisle

1:05:57.611 --> 1:05:58.870
<i>and sees her at the other end,</i>

1:05:58.955 --> 1:06:00.872

no qualms about it.</i>

- Shih tzu.
- Okay.

- Wow.
- Really?

1:06:21.978 --> 1:06:22.719
- So you're really
passionate about it.

1:06:22.812 --> 1:06:24.062
- I know.

1:06:24.146 --> 1:06:24.971
- How many dogs do you
have in your house?

1:06:25.064 --> 1:06:26.564
- I just have one on my own.

1:06:26.724 --> 1:06:28.650
- God forbid they set me up
with a man with a small dog.

1:06:28.809 --> 1:06:30.893
And a penis to match.
Can you imagine?

1:06:30.978 --> 1:06:32.729
Ugh.

1:06:32.813 --> 1:06:34.406
That dog
wouldn't stand a chance.

1:06:34.490 --> 1:06:37.400

so bad.

you don't want her

1:06:51.590 --> 1:06:52.832
not to like about you?

1:06:52.925 --> 1:06:54.250
- Well, I think the one thing--

1:06:54.343 --> 1:06:56.428
I wanted to get a cat
for, like, my apartment

1:06:56.512 --> 1:07:00.265
with, like, my roommate,
and I'm getting two.

1:07:00.349 --> 1:07:03.092
So everyone I've met
has been allergic.

1:07:03.177 --> 1:07:04.436
- Oh.

1:07:04.520 --> 1:07:06.095
- But then I had
a coworker move in with me.

1:07:06.188 --> 1:07:07.680
She brought a cat.
So, like, to tell the girl,

1:07:07.773 --> 1:07:09.599
"Hey, what's up?
I got three cats."

1:07:09.692 --> 1:07:11.100
- [laughs]

1:07:11.185 --> 1:07:12.193
- I'm off the table.
I'm allergic to cats.

1:07:12.278 --> 1:07:13.445
- You're allergic to cats.

1:07:13.529 --> 1:07:14.353
- Not gonna work.
- It's not gonna work.

1:07:14.438 --> 1:07:15.864
- Not gonna work.

1:07:15.948 --> 1:07:17.940

And that was kind of rough.

It was kind of like
you got dumped to your face.

1:15:48.126 --> 1:15:50.294

and thinking more about

1:15:50.379 --> 1:15:52.380

'Cause they might not make it

1:38:26.317 --> 1:38:28.392
Being able to have that
be a wife

1:38:28.477 --> 1:38:31.062

1:38:31.146 --> 1:38:34.324

Nothing I can do about it.

he pulls me in when I fidget,

1:39:32.383 --> 1:39:35.876

want the right side of the bed.

will be sleeping next to me,

1:39:39.640 --> 1:39:43.634

You know, even though the

I feel really calm, collected,

1:41:24.661 --> 1:41:27.738
I've never met a stranger
I didn't like,

Now, some strangers don't like

I can get through them,

2:01:45.873 --> 2:01:47.373
- Work out?
- Yeah.

2:01:47.458 --> 2:01:48.633
- I like to work out
first thing in the morning.

2:01:48.792 --> 2:01:49.968
- So I started--I've been
going first thing

2:01:50.052 --> 2:01:51.294
in the morning, 'cause I figure

2:01:51.378 --> 2:01:52.628
I can't do my split shifts
when I get married,

2:01:52.713 --> 2:01:53.629
so I gotta do a straight shift.

2:01:53.723 --> 2:01:54.723
I'm like,
"Listen, I'm married."

2:01:54.807 --> 2:01:55.974
I'm like, "My wife's not gonna
want me,

2:01:56.058 --> 2:01:57.383
like, splitting my shift
and being home late,"

2:01:57.476 --> 2:01:58.643
so I started going in, like,
at 5:00 in the morning

2:01:58.728 --> 2:02:00.729
so I could just
get used to that.

2:02:00.813 --> 2:02:02.564
- Oh, my God.
You're giving me WAP.

2:02:02.648 --> 2:02:03.898
I'm loving that.

2:02:03.983 --> 2:02:05.150
Like, a man who wants
to be there

2:02:05.234 --> 2:02:07.810
for his family after work?
Hoo!

2:02:07.895 --> 2:02:10.238
You know, I had to, like,
beg and plead my ex

2:02:10.323 --> 2:02:11.898
to change his work shift
by one hour

2:02:11.982 --> 2:02:13.483
so we could have
dinner together.

2:02:13.567 --> 2:02:15.243

is willing to jump above

2:02:15.328 --> 2:02:17.153
<i>and beyond
before he's even met me</i>

2:02:17.237 --> 2:02:18.830

a great home

2:02:18.914 --> 2:02:20.749

2:02:20.833 --> 2:02:23.585

for the adventure

2:02:23.669 --> 2:02:25.161

into his life,

2:02:25.245 --> 2:02:28.331

like, love and stability

2:02:28.415 --> 2:02:30.083
he's gonna bring into mine.

2:02:30.167 --> 2:02:31.343
I just want to have a family

2:02:31.427 --> 2:02:32.251
and live a debt-free life
and be happy.

2:02:32.336 --> 2:02:33.669

2:02:33.754 --> 2:02:34.670
- So I want my husband
to come home from work

2:02:34.764 --> 2:02:35.847
and want to dance in the kitchen

2:02:35.931 --> 2:02:37.090

- Yes.

2:02:37.174 --> 2:02:38.600

the money and I stay home,

2:02:50.437 --> 2:02:51.946
- I literally said that.
- "Have her food ready."

2:02:52.031 --> 2:02:53.782
- I was like, "He can--he can
be the stay-at-home mom."

2:02:53.866 --> 2:02:55.191
I was like,
"But just don't expect me

2:02:55.275 --> 2:02:56.609
to work all day
and cook and clean."

2:02:56.693 --> 2:02:59.028

2:02:59.113 --> 2:03:00.205
