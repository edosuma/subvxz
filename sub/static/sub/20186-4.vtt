Ah.

00:50.018 --> 00:51.204
Ah.

01:34.368 --> 01:36.673
Ah.

01:45.270 --> 01:46.743
Sì, señor.

01:53.526 --> 01:54.548
Ah.

02:16.101 --> 02:17.567
Whoa.

02:39.792 --> 02:40.810

02:52.384 --> 02:54.048
Ahhhh.

03:26.558 --> 03:27.923
Whoa.

03:34.728 --> 03:37.056
Ahhh.

04:14.542 --> 04:16.165

05:20.018 --> 05:21.329
Mm?

Pop?

08:33.034 --> 08:34.462
Hey, honey.

08:34.488 --> 08:36.269
Almost didn't recognize the number.

08:36.270 --> 08:37.982
I'm sorry.

08:38.008 --> 08:39.640
They changed my hours up at work.

08:39.666 --> 08:41.957
I'm still gettin' used to it.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.421
How are you two?

08:44.423 --> 08:45.940
We're great.

08:45.965 --> 08:47.624
Did it go okay?

08:47.626 --> 08:49.960
Yeah, yeah, thanks to
those movers you got.

08:49.962 --> 08:52.262
All I had to do was watch.

08:52.264 --> 08:54.934
And, Pop, this house...

08:55.645 --> 08:57.167
It's good?

08:57.169 --> 08:59.043
It's great.

08:59.068 --> 09:00.671
Kaylee loves her new school.

09:00.673 --> 09:02.526
The neighborhood's friendly.

09:02.551 --> 09:04.374
We feel safe.

09:04.376 --> 09:06.209
That's good.

09:06.211 --> 09:08.712
Mike, I don't know how to thank you.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.881
Well, you don't have to.

09:10.883 --> 09:13.951
I'm just glad you're enjoying it.

09:13.953 --> 09:16.307
Do you want to come over for dinner?

09:16.332 --> 09:17.549
Tonight?

09:17.574 --> 09:20.824
Sure. I'm making lasagna.
There'll be plenty.

09:23.228 --> 09:25.696
Well, that's very sweet, but
I don't want to put you out.

09:25.698 --> 09:27.397
Pop-pop, come over!

09:27.399 --> 09:30.535
There's someone here
who wants to see you.

09:45.484 --> 09:47.358
Ice cream!

09:49.488 --> 09:51.113
Oh, is she snoozing?

09:51.138 --> 09:52.701
Close.

09:53.559 --> 09:55.158
Ice cream?

09:56.328 --> 09:57.928
I shoulda let well enough alone.

09:57.930 --> 10:00.197
Well, I can't understand it.

10:00.199 --> 10:02.866
According to the map, we were
supposed to be taking a shortcut.

10:02.868 --> 10:04.434
I'm good.

10:04.436 --> 10:06.436
- You sure?
- Yeah.

10:06.438 --> 10:07.738
I'll have his.

10:07.740 --> 10:09.339
Oh, I don't think so.

10:09.341 --> 10:12.075
Maybe we can get a lift.

10:19.918 --> 10:21.322
Hey!

10:21.347 --> 10:22.352
What's the matter?

10:22.354 --> 10:23.754
There's some guys
hanging around the truck.

10:23.756 --> 10:25.022
Air Raid Wardens?

10:25.024 --> 10:26.523
No, these is funny-lookin' guys.

10:26.525 --> 10:28.125
What do you mean "funny-lookin'"?

10:28.127 --> 10:29.898
I mean funny-lookin', like fish.

10:29.923 --> 10:32.095
Who are you kidding? What
do you mean "like fish"?

10:32.097 --> 10:33.711
- They got scales.
- Hey.

10:33.736 --> 10:35.032
- Where?
- All over 'em!

10:35.034 --> 10:36.618
You okay?

10:37.064 --> 10:39.970
Oh, yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

10:39.972 --> 10:42.633
They're off a flyin'
saucer, off a sputnik.

10:42.658 --> 10:44.640
Ohh, look! They've seen us!

10:44.665 --> 10:46.086
Let's get outta here!

10:46.111 --> 10:47.689
They're from outer space.

10:47.714 --> 10:49.713
They're off a flying saucer!

10:54.644 --> 10:56.001
Receipt.

11:16.515 --> 11:17.788
Eh.

11:30.789 --> 11:32.956
Welcome to Los Pollos
Hermanos. May I take your order?

11:32.958 --> 11:35.425
¿Tu jefe esta aquí?

11:36.491 --> 11:37.694
Ah...

11:37.696 --> 11:39.496
¿Donde esta?

11:39.498 --> 11:41.279
Uh, men's room is over
there on the left, sir.

11:41.304 --> 11:45.035
Cabrón, I need to see your boss.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.471
Okay. Well, I'm... I'm
the assistant manager.

11:47.473 --> 11:48.939
The manager's actually not here today.

11:48.941 --> 11:52.109
Not the manager... the boss.

11:53.257 --> 11:55.345
- You mean Mr. Fring?
- Mr. Fring.

11:55.347 --> 11:58.927
O-okay, well, he's
not here at the moment.

11:58.952 --> 12:01.412
Uh, I'm sure I could help
you with whatever you need.

12:01.437 --> 12:03.304
I need Fring.

12:04.223 --> 12:05.722
Well, like I said, he's not here,

12:05.724 --> 12:07.324
uh, and I don't really
know when he'll be back.

12:07.326 --> 12:09.369
I can... I can take a message.

12:09.394 --> 12:11.077
I'll wait.

12:13.587 --> 12:15.198
You... you don't have to do that.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.833
I'd be happy to take a message.

12:16.835 --> 12:19.709
Uh, I'm sure Mr. Fring wouldn't
want to keep you waiting.

12:23.509 --> 12:25.876
Uh, okay, sir, if
you... if you don't mind,

12:25.878 --> 12:28.107
there are oth... there
are other customers.

12:30.779 --> 12:32.416
Uh, s-sorry about that.

12:32.441 --> 12:34.717
Welcome to Los Pollos Hermanos.
Uh, may I take your order?

12:34.742 --> 12:36.942
Yeah, can I get a 12-piece bucket,

12:36.967 --> 12:39.170
uh, with jumbo fries...

12:39.195 --> 12:40.759
and, uh...

12:40.784 --> 12:43.178
- You said the 12-piece?
- Yeah, the 12-piece.

12:43.203 --> 12:44.484
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

12:45.337 --> 12:46.904
Uh, excuse me, sir.

12:46.929 --> 12:48.161
You can't light that in here.

12:48.186 --> 12:49.552
Sir!

12:49.577 --> 12:52.232
There's no smoking on the premises.

12:53.890 --> 12:55.957
Please, sir, look... look at the signs.

12:55.982 --> 12:57.445
No fumar.

12:58.507 --> 13:01.890
You can't. That's... it's a...
it's a health-code violation.

13:06.743 --> 13:09.345
- Uh, sir, it's employees only.
- We have to go, okay?

13:09.370 --> 13:10.719
Let's go.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.266
Sir!

13:22.030 --> 13:23.507
Sir!

13:33.549 --> 13:35.953
Sir, you're not allowed back here.

13:52.131 --> 13:55.223
Gus Fring is a pillar of
our local business community,

13:55.248 --> 13:57.545
and not just for underwriting
our travel raffle,

13:57.570 --> 14:00.137
but for making the best
damn chicken in town!

14:01.686 --> 14:03.520
- Gus.
- Thank you.

14:03.546 --> 14:05.212
Thank you.

14:05.214 --> 14:07.361
Well, uh, gentlemen, ladies, uh,

14:07.386 --> 14:09.716
I-I hope to never need your services...

14:09.718 --> 14:11.330
I mean, no offense, but...

14:11.355 --> 14:13.353
if I ever did, it's good to know that...

14:31.040 --> 14:32.439
Yes?

14:43.319 --> 14:45.118
I'll be right there.

15:09.361 --> 15:11.792
I want you all to go home now.

15:12.281 --> 15:14.862
You will be compensated
for your full shifts.

15:15.214 --> 15:17.143
Normal schedule tomorrow.

15:21.564 --> 15:23.612
Go now.

15:24.113 --> 15:26.268
We are closed for today.

15:35.223 --> 15:37.995
Mr. Fring, y-you sure you want
to be left with these guys?

15:38.020 --> 15:39.712
I'm fine, Lyle.

15:39.737 --> 15:41.962
- You go home.
- Should I call someone?

15:41.964 --> 15:43.300
No.

15:43.999 --> 15:45.899
That will not be necessarily. Truly.

15:45.901 --> 15:47.334
Are you sure?

15:47.336 --> 15:49.136
Please do as I ask.

15:49.138 --> 15:50.737
I'll see you tomorrow.

16:01.016 --> 16:03.285
He's waiting in the office.

16:03.895 --> 16:06.386
I know where he is.

16:11.184 --> 16:13.060
Don Hector.

16:13.062 --> 16:15.429
Took you long enough.

16:27.376 --> 16:29.223
Don Hector,

16:29.248 --> 16:32.653
mine is a cartel business,

16:33.100 --> 16:36.082
but it is mine.

16:36.919 --> 16:39.049
And it is legitimate.

16:39.074 --> 16:41.785
My employees are civilians.

16:42.091 --> 16:45.028
Your actions here today
have endangered them,

16:45.053 --> 16:49.121
my interests, and those of the cartel.

16:50.966 --> 16:53.438
I am the cartel.

16:53.463 --> 16:56.466
And from now on, you are my mule.

16:56.491 --> 17:00.526
You are going to bring my product north.

17:02.111 --> 17:03.665
Mierda.

17:04.291 --> 17:06.008
Ah.

17:14.182 --> 17:17.954
I understand that your supply
line has been compromised,

17:18.454 --> 17:21.328
and this is most unfortunate.

17:21.329 --> 17:25.781
However, my trucks are
already at maximum capacity.

17:25.807 --> 17:27.555
Make room.

17:29.338 --> 17:31.063
Don Hector,

17:31.088 --> 17:33.459
you must understand that
I answer to Juan Bolsa.

17:33.484 --> 17:36.777
You want to cry to Bolsa, cry to Bolsa.

17:36.779 --> 17:39.125
Or, hell, Eladio.

17:42.109 --> 17:43.617
Adding more product will threaten

17:43.619 --> 17:46.586
the reliability of the entire operation.

17:47.172 --> 17:48.969
May I ask...

17:48.994 --> 17:52.453
did Don Eladio approve this?

17:55.342 --> 17:58.280
I approve this.

18:08.341 --> 18:10.638
You're doin' it.

20:02.024 --> 20:04.063
You gonna let me out of here?

20:04.737 --> 20:06.258
Hello?

20:15.137 --> 20:16.903
Tell him we're square.

20:16.905 --> 20:19.196
What? No.

21:45.515 --> 21:47.959
Excuse me, everyone.

21:47.984 --> 21:50.804
Could you all please take a
moment and join me out here?

21:50.806 --> 21:52.772
Please, come.

21:56.479 --> 21:58.664
Come, come, come.

22:07.622 --> 22:09.736
I would, uh,

22:10.291 --> 22:14.427
I would like to apologize
to each and every one of you

22:14.429 --> 22:18.759
who, yesterday, had to endure
the behavior of those men.

22:20.713 --> 22:23.837
It was unacceptable.

22:25.177 --> 22:28.013
Despite the difficult circumstances,

22:28.038 --> 22:32.208
you all acquitted yourselves impeccably.

22:32.643 --> 22:34.536
That said,

22:35.210 --> 22:37.207
if any of you wish to seek counseling

22:37.232 --> 22:39.652
due to lingering trauma,

22:39.654 --> 22:44.247
speak with me privately,
and it will be arranged.

22:44.638 --> 22:49.195
Also, you will all be
receiving 24 hours of overtime,

22:49.197 --> 22:51.497
as I am sure, in one way or another,

22:51.522 --> 22:53.996
each of you brought this
incident home with you.

22:54.021 --> 22:55.958
Uh, yes, Lyle?

22:56.304 --> 22:58.647
Mr. Fring, uh...

22:58.672 --> 23:01.115
who were those guys?

23:03.879 --> 23:07.313
Well, some of you know,
that many years ago,

23:07.315 --> 23:09.482
I opened my first Los Pollos Hermanos

23:09.484 --> 23:11.482
in Michoacán.

23:13.989 --> 23:15.764
Shortly thereafter,

23:15.789 --> 23:19.990
those same men showed up.

23:21.052 --> 23:23.229
They wanted money.

23:23.231 --> 23:26.295
And I-I am...

23:26.320 --> 23:30.709
I'm ashamed to say that I paid them.

23:31.295 --> 23:35.375
You see, in that place, at that time,

23:35.377 --> 23:38.467
if I wished to conduct my business...

23:38.492 --> 23:40.546
I had no choice.

23:40.548 --> 23:42.966
but yesterday...

23:46.421 --> 23:50.170
yesterday, they came here.

23:50.992 --> 23:52.525
Here.

23:54.694 --> 23:57.461
They intimidated my customers.

23:57.486 --> 24:00.321
They threatened my employees.

24:00.323 --> 24:02.912
And, again,

24:03.765 --> 24:05.993
they wanted money.

24:05.995 --> 24:10.271
Now, my friends, I-I must confess

24:10.296 --> 24:13.466
that I almost gave
them what they wanted.

24:13.836 --> 24:16.889
But then, I thought, "No.

24:17.206 --> 24:19.039
"No.

24:19.041 --> 24:22.389
"This is America."

24:23.045 --> 24:27.147
Here, the righteous
have no reason to fear.

24:27.172 --> 24:30.436
Here, those men have no power.

24:31.153 --> 24:34.088
And when they saw that
I had no fear of them,

24:34.090 --> 24:36.390
they ran like the cowards they are.

24:36.392 --> 24:38.574
Back across the border.

24:39.742 --> 24:43.040
They will not return.

24:43.065 --> 24:46.168
We will move on from this.

24:46.193 --> 24:48.207
My friends,

24:48.234 --> 24:51.394
I promise you...

24:53.673 --> 24:57.721
that together, we will prosper.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.456
All right.

25:05.535 --> 25:08.012
Yes, hi. I'm still here.

25:08.465 --> 25:10.958
Really? Uh, are you sure?

25:10.960 --> 25:12.626
Sure. Gotcha.

25:12.628 --> 25:14.402
Sorry for bothering you.

25:18.656 --> 25:20.313
Hi. I'm calling because

25:20.338 --> 25:23.119
we had an appointment with you guys for,

25:23.144 --> 25:25.985
I think, Wednesday?

25:26.010 --> 25:27.118
I'll be honest with you...

25:27.143 --> 25:29.743
I can barely read my
own darn handwriting.

25:29.745 --> 25:31.378
My mistake.

25:31.380 --> 25:33.080
Okay. Have a nice day.

25:37.620 --> 25:41.126
Hello. I'm calling to confirm an
appointment for Charles McGill.

25:41.151 --> 25:44.462
Yes, it's 215 San Cristobal Road...

25:44.487 --> 25:46.230
McGill, with an "M."

25:46.255 --> 25:47.389
A door?

25:47.414 --> 25:48.614
Oh. Okay.

25:48.639 --> 25:50.572
I thought it was you guys.

25:50.597 --> 25:51.942
Guess I was wrong.

25:51.967 --> 25:53.267
Thanks, anyway.

25:54.698 --> 25:58.718
Hi! I'm calling about an
appointment for Charles McGill.

25:58.743 --> 26:00.908
Well, that's why I'm calling.

26:00.910 --> 26:03.095
I think it's for this week, but...

26:03.120 --> 26:05.415
Good thing my head's
attached to my neck, right?

26:05.440 --> 26:07.247
San Cristobal... that's right.

26:07.249 --> 26:11.251
Yes, that's it! 2:30 tomorrow.

26:11.253 --> 26:12.681
Great!

26:12.706 --> 26:16.374
So, uh, we're gonna need to cancel that.

26:16.399 --> 26:17.768
Yeah.

26:17.793 --> 26:19.293
I will.

26:19.295 --> 26:21.362
Thank you. Bye.

26:25.835 --> 26:28.267
Ohh, poor Frisky.

26:28.292 --> 26:32.039
Mm. Pomeranians can be
difficult... all that hair.

26:32.041 --> 26:33.751
I know.

26:33.776 --> 26:36.968
So, Mrs. Vallance, does
Thursday 11:30 work?

26:37.711 --> 26:39.789
That's right.

26:39.814 --> 26:41.765
No.

26:41.790 --> 26:43.007
Really?

26:43.078 --> 26:45.946
Martin's Handyman and
Repair... 2:30 tomorrow.

26:45.948 --> 26:47.093
Thank you.

26:47.118 --> 26:49.326
How many calls did that take?

26:49.351 --> 26:51.618
I lost track. Is that it?

26:51.929 --> 26:54.020
Yeah. I'm nearly done.

26:54.022 --> 26:56.898
I'm just giving it a remorse pass.

26:56.923 --> 26:58.912
Well, remorse is important.

27:05.578 --> 27:08.109
"Destroyed property."

27:10.062 --> 27:12.672
Hmm. I'd try...

27:12.697 --> 27:14.568
"damaged" the victim's property

27:14.593 --> 27:15.829
instead of "destroyed" property.

27:15.854 --> 27:18.945
- See if you can't get away with that.
- Yeah.

27:24.933 --> 27:26.153
Boom.

27:26.472 --> 27:28.181
Oh. That's nice.

27:30.292 --> 27:31.877
I mean it, by the way.

27:31.902 --> 27:33.144
What?

27:34.933 --> 27:36.534
Thank you.

27:36.559 --> 27:38.464
Seriously.

27:39.968 --> 27:41.935
You're welcome seriously.

27:44.898 --> 27:47.589
- I better get back to it.
- Yeah.

27:48.597 --> 27:49.943
Are you...?

27:49.945 --> 27:54.247
You're absolutely sure you
got the right guy for this?

27:54.249 --> 27:58.628
Oh, uh, the crème de la crème.

28:28.911 --> 28:30.411
Martin's Repair?

28:30.436 --> 28:32.498
- Yeah. Mr. McGill?
- Good afternoon.

28:32.523 --> 28:34.692
If you don't mind wiping your shoes?

28:37.078 --> 28:38.623
It's this way.

28:44.399 --> 28:46.566
Mind... mind the step here.

28:46.568 --> 28:49.369
Uh, as you'll see, the
frame is boarded over,

28:49.371 --> 28:52.505
but the, uh, the door itself is intact.

28:52.530 --> 28:55.371
The damage is mainly to
the doorjamb and the casing.

28:55.420 --> 28:57.320
There's another step up here.

29:04.298 --> 29:06.332
- Ohh.
- Mm-hmm.

29:09.920 --> 29:12.524
- Break-in?
- That's right.

29:15.016 --> 29:18.610
Went after your copper
wire, from the look of it.

29:20.702 --> 29:22.569
There was a time... remember?

29:22.571 --> 29:25.005
When we could leave our doors unlocked.

29:25.007 --> 29:26.976
I certainly do.

29:27.001 --> 29:28.876
Well...

29:29.391 --> 29:31.304
Where do I plug in?

29:31.329 --> 29:32.462
You don't.

29:32.487 --> 29:33.796
- No?
- No.

29:33.821 --> 29:35.415
Didn't you...

29:35.417 --> 29:38.241
I believe my assistant was very
clear with your dispatcher...

29:38.266 --> 29:39.753
no electricity,

29:39.755 --> 29:42.956
due to a condition that was
explained in some detail.

29:45.727 --> 29:47.360
No problem.

29:47.362 --> 29:49.029
Good thing I charged my battery.

29:49.031 --> 29:52.321
I'd be going at it like
Fred Flintstone, otherwise.

29:54.102 --> 29:56.031
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

29:56.056 --> 29:59.072
I understood there would be
no power tools of any kind.

29:59.074 --> 30:01.350
What? A screwdriver and a hammer?

30:01.375 --> 30:03.376
Turns a morning job into two days

30:03.378 --> 30:05.712
with me, myself, and Bengay.

30:05.714 --> 30:07.480
But... it's your call.

30:10.469 --> 30:12.477
I suppose...

30:13.655 --> 30:15.497
Very well, if...

30:25.547 --> 30:28.186
You seem to be making fast work of it.

30:28.211 --> 30:31.024
That's good. That's good.

30:31.280 --> 30:33.829
Um, okay, what I'll
do, I think, is, uh...

32:10.579 --> 32:12.241
Very good.

32:12.243 --> 32:13.999
Oh, yeah.

32:14.024 --> 32:15.874
Nice.

32:17.882 --> 32:19.414
Great.

32:19.439 --> 32:20.775
Yep, nice.

32:20.799 --> 32:24.335
At some point, we should probably
discuss the rule of thirds,

32:24.360 --> 32:26.661
but, otherwise, these, uh...

32:26.686 --> 32:30.187
Oh, wow. Yep.

32:30.212 --> 32:33.819
A gas lantern sitting on a stack
of friggin' Financial Times.

32:33.844 --> 32:35.878
Now, that tells the whole story.

32:35.880 --> 32:38.069
These are museum quality.

32:38.094 --> 32:42.561
You, my friend, are the Ansel
Adams of covert photography.

32:43.922 --> 32:46.265
And that other thing?

32:59.856 --> 33:01.288
How'd you get it?

33:01.313 --> 33:04.054
Address book on his desk.

33:04.755 --> 33:06.366
Right.

33:08.089 --> 33:09.741
So...

33:10.798 --> 33:13.124
what'dya think of him?

33:13.149 --> 33:16.252
I mean, speak freely. You
couldn't possibly offend me.

33:16.254 --> 33:18.968
He's a bit of a prick, right?

33:21.413 --> 33:23.226
Nothing?

33:23.228 --> 33:24.936
Seriously?

33:25.366 --> 33:26.975
All right.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.538
Can't even dish the dirt with this guy.

33:29.563 --> 33:32.327
Isn't our business concluded?

33:32.352 --> 33:34.794
Yeah, even Steven.

33:34.819 --> 33:38.593
- I mean, you did fix the door, right?
- Yeah.

33:38.618 --> 33:40.655
Y-you did a reasonably good job of it?

33:40.680 --> 33:43.169
- Because, otherwise, he'll be...
- He won't be grumbling to anyone.

33:43.194 --> 33:44.814
That's all I'm asking.

33:44.816 --> 33:46.796
I did it right.

33:47.389 --> 33:48.918
Thank you.

33:50.388 --> 33:53.085
Nice to fix something for once.

33:53.936 --> 33:55.468
Hell, if that's how you feel,

33:55.493 --> 33:58.710
I got a leaky toilet back at the office.

33:58.735 --> 34:00.944
All right.

34:00.969 --> 34:03.570
If you ever need anything from my end...

34:06.304 --> 34:08.103
Hasta luego.

34:43.672 --> 34:45.360
May we talk?

34:47.618 --> 34:49.980
You can park it over there.

35:13.074 --> 35:16.103
You sent back the
payment we agreed upon.

35:17.649 --> 35:20.823
What I did, I didn't do for you.

35:25.145 --> 35:26.894
The man.

35:27.485 --> 35:30.847
The one killed for
helping the truck driver.

35:32.591 --> 35:35.271
If I may make an observation...

35:36.123 --> 35:38.528
Perhaps you are trying
to correct something

35:38.530 --> 35:40.365
which cannot be corrected.

35:41.866 --> 35:45.401
It's not the kind of thing
I want to take money for.

35:45.403 --> 35:47.980
But the fact remains that your actions

35:48.005 --> 35:50.206
benefited me more than you can know.

35:50.208 --> 35:52.275
That's your business.

35:52.300 --> 35:56.410
I'm just glad to have
Salamanca out of my head.

36:01.047 --> 36:03.338
Well, perhaps, in the future...

36:03.834 --> 36:06.268
you will consider working for me.

36:15.633 --> 36:17.373
Could be.

36:17.935 --> 36:20.213
That'd depend on the work.

36:34.147 --> 36:36.707
Would you care to know why...

36:36.732 --> 36:39.614
I stopped you from killing Hector?

36:40.225 --> 36:43.396
Like you said... it
wasn't in your interest.

36:45.669 --> 36:49.786
A bullet to the head would
have been far too humane.

37:37.484 --> 37:39.046
Jimmy.

37:39.078 --> 37:40.905
Howard.

37:53.591 --> 37:55.224
Jimmy.

38:13.963 --> 38:15.338
Howard.

38:15.363 --> 38:17.663
- Kim.
- Chuck.

38:17.688 --> 38:19.276
Kim.

38:50.859 --> 38:52.553
Good afternoon.

38:53.350 --> 38:56.271
Oh! Good.

38:56.296 --> 38:57.919
Mr. McGill, does this work for you?

38:57.921 --> 39:00.355
It'll have to do. Thank you.

39:00.357 --> 39:03.459
I assume everyone left
their cellphones and so on

39:03.484 --> 39:05.093
at reception.

39:05.095 --> 39:06.381
Yes, indeed.

39:06.406 --> 39:09.864
And you'll let me know if you
need a break or anything else?

39:09.866 --> 39:11.733
I will. Thank you, Ms. Hay.

39:11.735 --> 39:13.652
You know...

39:13.677 --> 39:17.405
I was actually speaking to my
husband about your condition.

39:17.407 --> 39:18.654
Oh, yes?

39:18.679 --> 39:20.775
I had an aunt. She's no longer with us.

39:20.777 --> 39:22.744
She went to church every Sunday,

39:22.769 --> 39:24.873
but when the boys' choir sang,

39:24.898 --> 39:27.282
she would absolutely have to leave.

39:27.307 --> 39:29.806
Something about the
frequency of their voices

39:29.831 --> 39:31.653
really did a number on her.

39:31.655 --> 39:34.375
- Well, that is a shame.
- Indeed.

39:34.400 --> 39:36.431
All right.

39:37.160 --> 39:40.005
Let's get down to it.

39:41.120 --> 39:42.731
We are here to finalize

39:42.756 --> 39:46.391
the Pre-Prosecution Diversion
for James Morgan McGill.

39:46.393 --> 39:49.902
Representing the divertee,
Ms. Kimberly Wexler.

39:49.927 --> 39:52.563
Mr. James McGill has signed a contract

39:52.565 --> 39:54.332
waiving his rights to a speedy trial

39:54.334 --> 39:56.000
and presentment of his case

39:56.002 --> 39:58.236
within the statute of limitations.

39:58.238 --> 40:00.505
The terms of the deal
are for you, James,

40:00.507 --> 40:02.774
to report to your
Pre-Prosecution Service Officer

40:02.776 --> 40:05.176
at the Albuquerque
District Attorney's Office

40:05.178 --> 40:07.445
on the second Monday of every month

40:07.447 --> 40:09.487
for the next 12 months.

40:09.512 --> 40:12.683
Community service
hours will be assigned.

40:12.685 --> 40:15.386
You must maintain lawful employment.

40:15.388 --> 40:19.346
Must only associate with
law-abiding citizens.

40:19.371 --> 40:20.713
Your client understands that,

40:20.738 --> 40:23.227
if he violates the
terms of the agreement

40:23.229 --> 40:25.696
or is arrested for any infraction,

40:25.698 --> 40:27.698
the crimes to which
he has confessed here

40:27.700 --> 40:30.301
will be prosecuted to the
full extent of the law,

40:30.303 --> 40:31.975
in addition to any new charges?

40:32.000 --> 40:33.304
He understands.

40:33.306 --> 40:35.039
And I must inform you, Mr. McGill,

40:35.041 --> 40:38.944
as an officer of the court
and member of the bar,

40:38.969 --> 40:40.878
your confession will be referred

40:40.880 --> 40:43.523
to the New Mexico Bar Association.

40:44.918 --> 40:46.784
Okay. I have your statement here.

40:46.786 --> 40:49.420
Has everyone had a chance to read it?

40:49.422 --> 40:51.255
Comments? Thoughts?

40:51.257 --> 40:53.090
Actually, page 2,

40:53.092 --> 40:55.960
he "damaged the victim's property."

40:55.962 --> 40:58.095
Would it not be more accurate to say

40:58.097 --> 41:00.431
"destroyed a cassette tape"?

41:00.433 --> 41:02.934
I'm sorry. Wasn't the
cassette tape his property?

41:02.936 --> 41:05.236
- Of course it was.
- Then it seems entirely accurate to say

41:05.238 --> 41:07.240
he damaged the victim's property.

41:07.265 --> 41:08.476
Why be vague?

41:08.501 --> 41:11.211
And "damaged" doesn't reflect
its irrevocable condition...

41:11.236 --> 41:13.644
Fine. "Damaged property
belonging to the victim."

41:13.646 --> 41:15.246
It was a cassette tape.

41:15.248 --> 41:17.682
That's what it was... not
a teacup, not a chair...

41:17.684 --> 41:19.684
- a cassette tape.
- Yeah.

41:19.686 --> 41:23.298
How about "destroyed item
of personal property"?

41:23.323 --> 41:25.089
All right.

41:25.091 --> 41:28.860
Uh, we'd suggest "destroyed
item of personal property."

41:28.995 --> 41:30.494
Ms. Wexler?

41:30.867 --> 41:32.630
Works for us.

41:32.632 --> 41:34.390
Shall I change it, or...?

41:34.415 --> 41:35.833
If you would.

41:41.841 --> 41:44.456
"Destroyed item...

41:44.481 --> 41:47.789
"of personal property."

41:47.814 --> 41:49.318
There.

41:49.343 --> 41:51.650
Can you initial it, please?

41:52.519 --> 41:56.002
"JMM." Initialed.

41:57.557 --> 42:00.157
Charles, was there anything
else you found wanting

42:00.159 --> 42:02.666
in your brother's statement?

42:04.218 --> 42:05.524
No.

42:05.549 --> 42:07.031
We're satisfied. Thank you.

42:09.385 --> 42:12.313
All right. So, we're all set.

42:12.338 --> 42:14.171
No, not all set, Mr. McGill.

42:14.173 --> 42:16.507
Your brother may be
satisfied, but I am not.

42:16.509 --> 42:19.677
The confession you've
written is adequate,

42:19.679 --> 42:23.147
but, frankly, I-I
sense a lack of remorse.

42:23.149 --> 42:26.010
And I, for one, would
like to hear an apology.

42:26.035 --> 42:28.702
Charles deserves at least that much.

42:29.322 --> 42:30.922
Uh...

42:31.282 --> 42:34.575
- Now?
- Yes, Mr. McGill, now.

42:37.764 --> 42:40.231
Okay.

42:41.718 --> 42:42.867
I was wrong.

42:42.869 --> 42:46.552
Mr. McGill, could you at least
look your brother in the eye?

42:55.971 --> 42:57.760
Chuck...

42:59.635 --> 43:01.503
I'm very sorry.

43:02.565 --> 43:05.523
I lost my temper, and
I did some things...

43:05.525 --> 43:08.903
so many things that I regret.

43:09.143 --> 43:13.253
I shouldn't have broken down your door.

43:13.466 --> 43:17.049
Doesn't matter how I was provoked.

43:17.643 --> 43:19.110
I-I shouldn't have done that.

43:19.135 --> 43:21.042
There's no excuse for that.

43:21.163 --> 43:24.552
Or for the things that I said.

43:26.161 --> 43:28.282
I regret it all,

43:28.307 --> 43:31.030
all of it more than you can imagine,

43:31.055 --> 43:32.784
because...

43:33.720 --> 43:35.456
'cause you're my brother,

43:35.481 --> 43:40.291
and no one should treat
his own brother like that.

43:40.293 --> 43:42.193
Not ever.

43:45.131 --> 43:46.824
Okay?

43:48.574 --> 43:50.401
All right, then.

43:50.403 --> 43:52.236
On to the matter of restitution.

43:52.238 --> 43:54.171
Mr. McGill, according to your agreement,

43:54.173 --> 43:55.979
you have two weeks to
pay your brother back.

43:56.004 --> 43:58.643
I would like to pay up now, if I may.

43:58.645 --> 44:00.254
You may.

44:00.680 --> 44:03.614
The amount is $321.

44:03.616 --> 44:06.017
Uh, Ms. Hay. I'm sorry.

44:06.019 --> 44:08.785
That figure doesn't
represent a full accounting.

44:08.810 --> 44:09.839
Oh, no?

44:09.864 --> 44:14.308
I believe the correct amount is $323.98.

44:14.519 --> 44:16.927
That includes the cassette tape...

44:16.929 --> 44:18.682
which was destroyed.

44:18.707 --> 44:20.050
Good. Thank you.

44:20.075 --> 44:23.051
$323.98,

44:23.076 --> 44:26.338
including the cassette tape.

44:47.560 --> 44:49.540
What do you say we get you home?

44:51.464 --> 44:53.698
Howard. Chuck.

44:53.700 --> 44:56.567
I'm putting you both on notice
regarding the bar hearing.

44:56.569 --> 44:58.903
The first thing, I'm filing a
motion to suppress that tape.

44:58.905 --> 45:00.905
The tape that Jimmy destroyed, you mean?

45:02.052 --> 45:03.423
How about we stop with the games?

45:03.448 --> 45:05.076
There's no way there isn't a duplicate.

45:05.078 --> 45:06.410
Really?

45:06.412 --> 45:08.012
Of course there is.

45:08.878 --> 45:10.400
You knew Jimmy was gonna break in.

45:10.425 --> 45:11.595
You wanted him to.

45:11.620 --> 45:12.963
There's no way you were
gonna let him destroy

45:12.988 --> 45:15.456
the only copy of that tape,
so you made a duplicate...

45:15.481 --> 45:17.384
- it's the first thing you did.
- Kim...

45:17.409 --> 45:18.923
this is not how we do discovery.

45:18.925 --> 45:21.024
Actually, Jimmy destroyed the duplicate.

45:22.161 --> 45:24.399
Ah, it's fine, Howard.

45:24.424 --> 45:27.565
The original is under lock
and key, and in due time,

45:27.567 --> 45:30.167
it will be put into
evidence for your review.

45:30.169 --> 45:32.670
So, of course, file
whatever motions you'd like.

45:32.672 --> 45:34.839
- It's your privilege.
- I will. Count on it.

45:34.841 --> 45:36.941
But, Kim, you should be aware...

45:36.943 --> 45:38.576
because I believe this will be

45:38.578 --> 45:40.578
your first disciplinary hearing...

45:40.580 --> 45:43.469
uh, the Bar Association's
standard of proof

45:43.494 --> 45:46.383
is far more lenient
than what you're used to.

45:46.385 --> 45:50.711
Motions aside, that tape will be played.

45:51.367 --> 45:52.790
- Chuck.
- Yeah.

45:53.127 --> 45:54.484
See you, Kim.

46:16.653 --> 46:18.297
Well?

46:20.486 --> 46:22.161
What?

46:22.849 --> 46:24.579
Bingo.
