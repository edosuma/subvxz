- See? Look at him right now.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.021

06:36.146 --> 06:37.898
We could learn a lot from him.

06:38.148 --> 06:40.401
Teach us everything you know, Finn.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.494
I guess that works.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.711
You find a couple more branch rubes.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.460

07:39.459 --> 07:41.587
to lay horizontal
between two blockhead trees.

07:41.836 --> 07:44.840

into leaning against each other.

hoodwinked our body temperature.

- Pea, pea. Where's the pea?
- Gee.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.941
I don't like the looks of this.

We couldn't scam this guy into being a rope.

You can't use scams to save
somebody from quicksand.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.529
You kids weren't scamming sticks
or branches or anything.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.402
You've been camping the whole time.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.628
ALL: No scam?

10:21.162 --> 10:24.257
Wow. You scammed us into
thinking we were scamming.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.543
You scammed us good.
You're our hero.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.295
Nothing was a scam.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.922
- GARY: (SARCASTICALLY) Yeah, right.
- No scam! No scam!

10:31.047 --> 10:32.299
(SIGHS) 1 give up-

10:34.425 --> 10:36.519
So, Finn,
how are the Marshmallow Kids doing?

10:37.303 --> 10:38.395
Eh?

10:39.806 --> 10:41.023
(GASPS)

10:43.268 --> 10:47.444
Fellas! I'm scamming these numbers
into subtracting themselves from each other.

10:47.689 --> 10:49.191
Ha-ha. Suckers.

10:50.567 --> 10:53.537
We're scamming this globe into teaching
us about geography.

10:53.945 --> 10:55.822
I had to get kind of rough with this book,

10:55.947 --> 10:58.826
but now it's putting thoughts into my head,
for nothing!

10:59.784 --> 11:01.582
You did a wonderful job, Finn.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.830
Now all we need to do is worry about him.

11:04.539 --> 11:06.541
Same as before. Let's do it some more.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.589
- FINN: Jake.
- Uh...

11:08.585 --> 11:10.553
These gentlemen dropped their shells.

11:10.712 --> 11:12.339
Heh. Gah-ooh...

11:14.924 --> 11:18.599
<i>Come along with me</i>

11:19.053 --> 11:22.603
<i>And the butterflies and bees</i>

11:26.227 --> 11:28.195
This party is so crazy!
