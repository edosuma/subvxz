00:01.093 --> 00:02.964
Previously on "11.22.63..."

00:02.965 --> 00:04.808
I need you to go in this closet.

00:04.809 --> 00:07.404
Then I'll tell you everything.

00:09.355 --> 00:10.514
What the fuck was that?

00:10.515 --> 00:13.404
That was 1960.

00:13.405 --> 00:14.554
Al, why did you show this to me?

00:14.555 --> 00:17.504
I need you to prevent the assassination

00:17.505 --> 00:19.434
of John F. Kennedy.

00:19.435 --> 00:21.484
Never gotten an A-plus before.

00:21.485 --> 00:23.414
Listen, you love Harry.

00:23.415 --> 00:25.444
I love Harry. We all love Harry.

00:25.445 --> 00:29.092
If you do something that
really fucks with the past,

00:29.093 --> 00:30.262
the past fucks with you.

00:30.263 --> 00:33.142
- My son!
- Sir, you shouldn't be here.

00:33.143 --> 00:34.292
I can't do this.

00:34.293 --> 00:37.232
We have a chance here to
change people's lives.

00:37.233 --> 00:41.232
The day that changed my
life was Halloween night.

00:41.233 --> 00:44.202
It was 1960.

00:44.203 --> 00:47.172
I lived in Holden, Kentucky.

00:47.173 --> 00:51.903
It was the night my father
murdered my mom, brother,

00:51.905 --> 00:52.944
and my sister.

00:52.946 --> 00:54.955
Hey, mister, are you lost?

00:55.463 --> 00:57.393
How far is Holden?

02:05.293 --> 02:07.133
Where are you going, Harry?

02:10.323 --> 02:12.312
Come on, Harry, don't be like that.

02:12.313 --> 02:14.292
We love you!

02:14.293 --> 02:16.193
Come on, Harry!

02:19.163 --> 02:20.313
Get back here.

02:26.323 --> 02:28.213
Where you going, Harry Fairy?

02:32.133 --> 02:34.092
Do it, Randy. Do the thing.

02:34.093 --> 02:35.252
- Yeah, Randy.
- Oh, yeah?

02:35.253 --> 02:38.132
All right, hold still, Harry.

02:38.133 --> 02:39.263
Open up.

02:46.123 --> 02:48.262
Grab his pants.

02:48.263 --> 02:50.283
Come on.

02:55.303 --> 02:57.222
Go get it, dumb ass.

03:00.203 --> 03:02.143
Oh, there they go.

03:10.273 --> 03:12.223
See you around, Harry Fairy.

04:10.193 --> 04:12.242
Oh, Jesus Christ on a crutch, Harry.

04:12.243 --> 04:14.202
I did what you said.

04:14.203 --> 04:17.172
I went through the woods,
but they knew somehow.

04:17.173 --> 04:20.221
You're gonna have to learn
how to defend yourself.

04:20.223 --> 04:23.172
I thought Frank would've
taught you that by now.

04:23.173 --> 04:24.322
Can I have the shorts, please?

04:24.323 --> 04:26.192
I don't know if I'm doing you any favors

04:26.193 --> 04:28.102
by letting you stash them here.

04:28.103 --> 04:29.172
I got to get to school.

04:29.173 --> 04:31.203
All right, just hold your horses.

04:57.103 --> 04:58.323
Thanks.

05:04.253 --> 05:06.222
Bye.

05:10.193 --> 05:12.232
Seems like a nice kid.

05:12.233 --> 05:15.112
Yeah.

05:15.113 --> 05:17.202
Anything else?

05:17.203 --> 05:21.192
Um, actually I'm... I'm
looking for a place to stay.

05:21.193 --> 05:23.182
Well, Lexington's about an hour.

05:23.183 --> 05:27.132
They got a lot of nice motels,
Holiday Inn, Howard Johnson.

05:27.133 --> 05:30.322
Actually maybe a place in Holden.

05:30.323 --> 05:32.252
Nobody stays here.

05:32.253 --> 05:34.222
Smell from the plant's
enough to keep most folks

05:34.223 --> 05:37.212
from even stopping for gas.

05:37.213 --> 05:41.142
Well, I just have a little business

05:41.143 --> 05:43.112
that I need to do before I go back east,

05:43.113 --> 05:45.292
so if you know of anything...

05:45.293 --> 05:47.103
All right.

05:50.213 --> 05:53.212
Right.

05:53.213 --> 05:55.252
Thank you.

05:55.253 --> 05:57.173
Um...

06:00.143 --> 06:02.222
You maybe could try the Prices,

06:02.223 --> 06:05.302
Edna and Arliss over on Fulton.

06:05.303 --> 06:09.262
They rent a room usually to
fellows with wife problems.

06:09.263 --> 06:12.312
They're good Christians.

06:12.313 --> 06:15.302
Great, love Christians.

07:18.263 --> 07:21.142
A writer?

07:21.143 --> 07:24.252
Yes, I'm actually working on
a book about the common man.

07:24.253 --> 07:27.112
Have you read "Let Us
Now Praise Famous Men"

07:27.113 --> 07:28.292
by James Agee?

07:28.293 --> 07:31.142
Are you a communist, Mr. Amberson?

07:31.143 --> 07:32.232
What? No.

07:32.233 --> 07:34.252
Aren't most writers communists?

07:34.253 --> 07:36.112
I don't know; I certainly am not.

07:36.113 --> 07:38.112
Because we are Baptists,

07:38.113 --> 07:40.312
so I prefer reading the
"Saturday Evening Post,"

07:40.313 --> 07:46.192
and Arliss is partial
to "Field and Stream."

07:46.193 --> 07:49.152
Those are both wonderful publications.

07:49.153 --> 07:50.322
How long would you need the room?

07:50.323 --> 07:54.112
I'll be leaving on the first.

07:54.113 --> 07:57.212
Three nights.

07:57.213 --> 07:59.292
I would have to charge
you the full-week rate.

07:59.293 --> 08:01.172
That's okay.

08:01.173 --> 08:04.242
You understand you are in our home,

08:04.243 --> 08:06.112
so there are certain rules.

08:06.113 --> 08:09.102
Is it necessary that I
spell them out for you?

08:09.103 --> 08:10.282
No, I think I get it.

08:10.283 --> 08:12.192
Well, just for my own peace of mind,

08:12.193 --> 08:17.172
no girls or food upstairs.

08:17.173 --> 08:18.202
Crystal clear.

08:18.203 --> 08:21.102
Fine, $3.

08:21.103 --> 08:22.282
Okay.

08:22.283 --> 08:25.102
In advance.

08:34.183 --> 08:38.102
It wasn't a day but a night.

08:38.102 --> 08:40.232
The night that changed my life.

08:42.173 --> 08:46.242
It was the night my
father murdered my mother

08:46.243 --> 08:52.133
and my brother and hurt me... bad.

08:53.313 --> 08:55.172
He hurt my sister too,

08:55.173 --> 08:58.102
so bad she went into a coma.

08:58.103 --> 09:00.262
In two months, she died
without waking up.

09:00.263 --> 09:04.122
Her name was Ellen, and
I loved her very much.

09:04.123 --> 09:06.142
We all loved Ellen. She was only seven,

09:06.143 --> 09:08.122
but she was a real Lucille Ball.

09:08.123 --> 09:09.222
Harry!

09:09.223 --> 09:12.192
She could make anybody
laugh, even my father.

09:12.193 --> 09:14.202
If he was sober, that is.

09:14.203 --> 09:17.102
When he was drunk, he was always mad.

09:17.103 --> 09:18.322
Harry!

09:18.323 --> 09:22.302
When he was drunk.

09:22.303 --> 09:24.223
Drunk.

09:35.263 --> 09:38.322
Hey.

09:38.323 --> 09:42.302
Day after tomorrow, you gonna
have many trick-or-treaters?

09:42.303 --> 09:46.092
Ah, a few.

09:46.093 --> 09:48.252
Well, I might go see the sights.

09:48.253 --> 09:50.223
Uh-huh.

09:53.273 --> 09:57.192
Do you know if there's a, um, like a...

09:57.193 --> 10:00.282
Sammy's Town House is
what you're looking for,

10:00.283 --> 10:03.102
out on the Dixie Highway.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.182
Sammy's, got it.

10:04.183 --> 10:07.192
Word of warning, friend.

10:07.193 --> 10:10.213
Edna's not to be trifled with.

10:13.193 --> 10:16.242
Got it.

10:23.223 --> 10:26.102
Evening.

10:26.103 --> 10:28.132
What can I get you?

10:28.133 --> 10:31.252
Uh... beer on tap?

10:31.253 --> 10:34.092
Falstaff in a bottle.

10:34.093 --> 10:37.212
That'll work.

10:37.213 --> 10:39.152
Quiet night.

10:39.153 --> 10:41.322
We're just getting started.

10:41.323 --> 10:44.322
Oh, ah...

10:44.323 --> 10:47.262
35.

10:47.263 --> 10:50.162
Um, do you happen to know a guy

10:50.163 --> 10:52.153
named Frank Dunning?

10:54.263 --> 10:55.322
Who are you?

10:55.323 --> 11:00.132
Oh, I'm Jake Amberson.

11:00.133 --> 11:01.172
What are you doing in Holden?

11:01.173 --> 11:02.282
Oh, just writing a book.

11:02.283 --> 11:04.212
About Frank Dunning?

11:04.213 --> 11:06.282
No, no, no, no, I was
just told to look him up

11:06.283 --> 11:09.143
if I was ever passing through.

11:11.203 --> 11:12.312
Did I say something wrong?

11:12.313 --> 11:15.092
If you want a table, you better get one.

11:15.093 --> 11:17.092
Plant's about to let out.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.132
All right.

11:19.133 --> 11:20.232
Keep the change, huh?

11:20.233 --> 11:22.162
Come on, boys!

11:22.163 --> 11:23.262
No hard feelings, Dickie.

11:23.263 --> 11:26.212
Billy boy, Billy boy, set 'em up, man.

11:26.213 --> 11:28.192
Hit me, and beers are on
Dickie tonight, okay?

11:28.193 --> 11:30.122
Yeah, I'm starting a tab.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.292
You can't run a tab. I
don't own this dump.

11:31.293 --> 11:33.202
Don't make me come around there, Billy.

11:33.203 --> 11:35.092
- Don't call me Billy.
- All right, fine.

11:35.093 --> 11:36.292
- Well, well, Billy, you don't...
- I warned you!

11:36.293 --> 11:38.132
Don't you come around here.

11:38.133 --> 11:39.292
Well, he's on his way around now.

11:39.293 --> 11:41.302
Stay behind the bar. You
stay behind the bar.

11:41.303 --> 11:43.282
- Hey, hey! All right!
- Come on, Billy!

11:43.283 --> 11:45.232
- What are you having?
- Give me a Fallstaff.

11:45.233 --> 11:46.322
- No, I'll...
- Just take it easy, man.

11:46.323 --> 11:47.322
- There you go.
- Thank you, Dickie.

11:47.323 --> 11:49.232
It's not a big deal.

11:49.233 --> 11:51.172
- See, I got what I need now.
- There you go.

11:51.173 --> 11:53.282
- Here's one for you.
- 35 on the go.

11:53.283 --> 11:55.162
- Got ya.
- 35 double.

11:55.163 --> 11:56.272
- Don't be an asshole, Dickie.
- Hey.

11:56.273 --> 11:58.102
- Come on.
- You're still here?

11:58.103 --> 12:00.102
Hey, Frank, drinks on me.

12:14.133 --> 12:16.142
All right then, make
it a double bourbon.

12:16.143 --> 12:17.272
Don't you spare the horses.

12:17.273 --> 12:20.112
How you doing, my man?

12:20.113 --> 12:23.102
- You guys good?
- Yeah.

12:23.103 --> 12:25.102
How is it over there?

12:25.103 --> 12:28.152
You got a friend, Frank,
someone says he knows you.

12:28.153 --> 12:30.172
Who?

12:30.173 --> 12:32.213
Jake Henderson. He's a writer.

12:36.143 --> 12:38.092
How about a round for all my friends?

12:40.113 --> 12:44.312
Especially our new friend
over here, Jake Henderson.

12:44.313 --> 12:46.322
Frank Dunning, Dunning Butchers.

12:46.323 --> 12:49.232
Hi, uh, Amberson. Jake Amberson.

12:49.233 --> 12:51.312
Oh, hell, did I say Henderson?

12:51.313 --> 12:53.262
God damn it, Bill gets everything wrong.

12:53.263 --> 12:57.192
I'm sorry about that. This
here is Calvin and Dickie.

12:59.093 --> 13:02.192
Pleased to meet you.

13:02.193 --> 13:04.252
So Bill tells me you're a writer,

13:04.253 --> 13:08.162
which means you're
probably an astronaut.

13:08.163 --> 13:10.162
No, he... he got that one right.

13:10.163 --> 13:12.312
Ah, well, even a broken clock
is right twice a day, huh?

13:12.313 --> 13:14.202
Sure.

13:14.203 --> 13:16.292
I don't get that.

13:16.293 --> 13:19.162
You don't... he doesn't get it.

13:19.163 --> 13:20.232
Yeah, see, this is the kind of shit

13:20.233 --> 13:22.192
that I get to deal with here in Holden,

13:22.193 --> 13:24.202
so maybe you could help a brother out.

13:24.203 --> 13:26.272
Bring in a little light
from the outside world,

13:26.273 --> 13:29.312
because I sure as hell need it.

13:29.313 --> 13:31.222
Yeah, I can try.

13:31.223 --> 13:33.142
That's the spirit, Jakey.

13:33.143 --> 13:35.292
- Cheers, boys, cheers.
- Yeah.

13:35.293 --> 13:38.103
- Cheers, cheers, cheers.
- Pleasure to meet you, Jake.

13:42.223 --> 13:47.112
"How, looking thus into your eyes

13:47.113 --> 13:53.092
"and seeing thus, how
each of you is a creature

13:53.093 --> 13:56.262
"that never in all time existed before

13:56.263 --> 13:59.302
and which will never in
all time exist again..."

13:59.303 --> 14:02.192
- Preach it, brother.
- "How am I to speak of thee

14:02.193 --> 14:06.142
"as tenants, farmers,

14:06.143 --> 14:09.102
"representatives of your class,

14:09.103 --> 14:12.202
"social integers in a criminal economy,

14:12.203 --> 14:16.152
"or as fathers, wives, sons,

14:16.153 --> 14:20.302
"daughters, individuals, as my friends

14:20.303 --> 14:23.202
and as I know thee?"

14:23.203 --> 14:25.202
Uh...

14:25.203 --> 14:27.132
You sure are full of shit.

14:27.133 --> 14:29.132
- That is... you're full of shit.
- That's Agee.

14:29.133 --> 14:31.092
That's James Agee.

14:31.093 --> 14:33.202
He knew what it was like to be a man.

14:33.203 --> 14:35.222
He knew what made us great.

14:35.223 --> 14:37.252
He saw guys like you.

14:37.253 --> 14:40.212
You know, the little guys at the bottom,

14:40.213 --> 14:42.322
struggling in the dirt,
because that's...

14:42.323 --> 14:46.232
That's where the real stuff of life is.

14:46.233 --> 14:48.272
Yeah, well, maybe you want
to tell my wife that.

14:48.273 --> 14:50.232
Yeah, or you can tell Frank's wife that,

14:50.233 --> 14:54.102
'cause he is the one
sleeping on my couch.

14:54.103 --> 14:56.102
Not for long.

14:56.103 --> 14:59.302
Yeah, Frank, I know it's hard, you know?

14:59.303 --> 15:02.142
I'm divorced myself.

15:02.143 --> 15:04.152
Yeah, I'm not divorced.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.322
Yeah, not yet.

15:05.323 --> 15:08.202
Why don't you shut your
fucking pie hole, Dickie?

15:08.203 --> 15:13.182
I'm just saying, you
know, maybe sometimes

15:13.183 --> 15:18.292
it's better to just walk
away from your problems.

15:18.293 --> 15:21.232
I ain't got no problems.

15:21.233 --> 15:24.242
In fact, half of what you just said

15:24.243 --> 15:26.283
went right over my head.

15:31.153 --> 15:34.222
But I figure every writer needs

15:34.223 --> 15:37.132
a great chapter one, am I right?

15:37.133 --> 15:38.302
Oh, yeah, 100%, yeah.

15:38.303 --> 15:41.212
Yeah.

15:41.213 --> 15:44.092
I'm about to give you yours.

15:44.093 --> 15:45.252
Come on.

15:50.293 --> 15:54.122
When I'm calling you.

16:00.123 --> 16:01.142
Where are we headed?

16:01.143 --> 16:03.242
Oh, you'll see.

16:05.123 --> 16:07.162
You like Slim Whitman?

16:07.163 --> 16:09.112
- Sure.
- Yeah?

16:09.113 --> 16:11.262
Not exactly you're cup
of tea, is that it?

16:11.263 --> 16:13.242
No, it's fine.

16:13.243 --> 16:17.262
Well, James Agee wouldn't like it.

16:17.263 --> 16:19.202
No, I mean, I didn't...

16:19.203 --> 16:22.272
So Bill tells me that you knew me.

16:22.273 --> 16:25.202
How so? 'Cause I sure
as shit don't know you.

16:25.203 --> 16:27.152
Oh, no, I didn't tell
him that I knew you.

16:27.153 --> 16:31.322
I just... there's this guy
in Lexington that told me

16:31.323 --> 16:33.312
if I ever passed through,
I should look you up.

16:33.313 --> 16:37.162
What kind of a guy? What was his name?

16:37.163 --> 16:39.182
- I don't remember.
- What did he look like?

16:39.183 --> 16:42.262
How did he know me?

16:44.273 --> 16:47.292
Guess he must've known
you in the service.

16:47.293 --> 16:53.272
He's short and wiry, uh, a joker.

16:53.273 --> 16:58.252
Oh, yeah, that had to be Woody Nelson.

16:58.253 --> 17:01.162
- Sounds right.
- Yeah.

17:01.163 --> 17:02.292
So what's your book about, Jakey?

17:02.293 --> 17:04.182
You ever written a book before?

17:04.183 --> 17:06.212
Um, no, this is my first one.

17:06.213 --> 17:09.172
So what's it about?

17:09.173 --> 17:10.321
It's a ghost story.

17:10.323 --> 17:14.212
Ooh, a ghost story.

17:14.213 --> 17:17.222
So what's it gonna be called?

17:17.223 --> 17:20.102
"Halloweentown."

17:20.103 --> 17:23.172
"Halloweentown"? "Halloweentown."

17:23.173 --> 17:26.152
Something like that.

17:26.153 --> 17:27.182
That's dumb.

17:27.183 --> 17:29.132
Why don't you shut up?

17:29.133 --> 17:32.162
You assholes think you could
write a book like Jakey here?

17:32.163 --> 17:35.212
Huh?

17:35.213 --> 17:37.122
- Oh, here we go.
- There it is, Jakey.

17:37.123 --> 17:39.132
This is gonna be fun.

18:00.313 --> 18:03.122
Hey, uh, what are...
What are we doing here?

18:03.123 --> 18:05.162
Oh, we're gonna have a little fun.

18:05.163 --> 18:08.202
You like fun, don't you, Jakey?

18:08.203 --> 18:09.282
- Sure.
- Frank.

18:09.283 --> 18:12.112
Clayton!

18:12.113 --> 18:13.302
You boys ain't supposed to
be here this time of night.

18:13.303 --> 18:16.102
Yeah, I got a friend
in from out of town.

18:16.103 --> 18:17.272
I wanted to show him where
his hamburger comes from.

18:17.273 --> 18:20.192
I was thinking maybe you could
take a little smoke break.

18:20.193 --> 18:22.312
Say 30 minutes?

18:22.313 --> 18:25.102
I'll need two.

18:25.103 --> 18:27.142
You can keep them all. Thank you.

18:27.143 --> 18:29.252
Right this way.

18:29.253 --> 18:33.272
So my family's been in the meat
business for three generations.

18:33.273 --> 18:38.102
My granddaddy... my
granddaddy used to travel

18:38.103 --> 18:42.092
from farm to farm butchering
whatever they had handy,

18:42.093 --> 18:43.222
right there in the front yard.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.152
Now, it doesn't get any
fresher than that.

18:45.153 --> 18:48.153
In fact, he's the one who
taught me how to use a knife.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.303
Come on, Jakey!

18:58.313 --> 19:00.302
My old man?

19:00.303 --> 19:03.272
He worked in this goddamn
building his whole life,

19:03.273 --> 19:05.272
but I tell you what,
we never went hungry.

19:05.273 --> 19:07.092
Sounds like a good man.

19:07.093 --> 19:09.302
Well, Mama loved him.

19:09.303 --> 19:12.272
Anyway, for as long as there
have been slaughterhouses,

19:12.273 --> 19:16.312
the worst job that you
could possibly have...

19:20.173 --> 19:23.172
Was to work the hide cellar.

19:23.173 --> 19:24.312
Yeah, it's them flies

19:24.313 --> 19:26.322
that make the fellas
down here go insane.

19:35.203 --> 19:36.312
There hadn't been no one who could last

19:36.313 --> 19:38.172
more than a month or two.

19:40.123 --> 19:41.272
The heat and the salt are one thing,

19:41.273 --> 19:44.102
but once them flies crawl
up inside your ears

19:44.103 --> 19:45.102
and start to live there...

19:45.103 --> 19:47.182
You can't be serious.

19:47.183 --> 19:50.163
Oh, yeah, sometimes they lay eggs.

19:55.323 --> 19:59.252
Welcome to the kill floor, Jakey.

19:59.253 --> 20:02.202
This is where all the action happens.

20:02.203 --> 20:04.092
Go get one.

20:04.093 --> 20:06.133
Get... get what, a cow?

20:14.163 --> 20:16.142
You know, when my daddy
worked the kill floor,

20:16.143 --> 20:18.152
they used to call him the Bambino,

20:18.153 --> 20:20.292
you know, like Babe Ruth,

20:20.293 --> 20:22.262
because it only took him one swing.

20:25.243 --> 20:28.122
When I was working down here,
it was never quite that easy,

20:28.123 --> 20:30.192
but I got in a lot of practice.

20:30.193 --> 20:32.202
Go on. Go on!

20:32.203 --> 20:34.092
Right in there.

20:34.093 --> 20:37.162
Come on now! Go on now!

20:37.163 --> 20:38.272
- Oh, there we go.
- Right in there.

20:38.273 --> 20:42.272
Don't be scared. Come
on, come on, come on!

20:49.093 --> 20:50.242
Guys, I don't... I don't want to...
I don't want to...

20:50.243 --> 20:52.092
Ow!

20:52.093 --> 20:54.182
- Ohh!
- Aww!

20:54.183 --> 20:57.162
I say we put him in the next chute too!

20:57.163 --> 20:58.282
- Let's put him in there.
- Shit!

20:58.283 --> 21:00.262
Okay, okay, okay.

21:00.263 --> 21:04.242
Oh, this is fun, ain't it?

21:04.243 --> 21:08.182
Go ahead, Shakespeare.

21:13.313 --> 21:17.112
Don't they use guns for this?

21:17.113 --> 21:19.272
Yeah, that's how the
chicken-shits do it.

21:19.273 --> 21:24.152
Special bullet melts the
brain nice and neat,

21:24.153 --> 21:28.162
but we wanted to see if you
were one of us, you know,

21:28.163 --> 21:30.253
struggling in the dirt.

21:33.213 --> 21:36.102
Go on, now.

21:36.103 --> 21:38.182
Show us what you got, yankee.

21:38.183 --> 21:40.172
Yeah, you're gonna...
You're gonna like it.

21:40.173 --> 21:44.182
You'll... you'll... You'll like it.

21:44.183 --> 21:47.152
Right between the eyes, Jakey boy.

21:47.153 --> 21:49.233
Put him out of his misery.

21:52.093 --> 21:53.152
Maybe it would help if you thought

21:53.153 --> 21:55.323
of that bitch ex-wife of yours.

22:08.293 --> 22:10.132
Jesus Christ, are you kidding me?

22:10.133 --> 22:13.232
Oh, come on!

22:13.233 --> 22:16.123
All right.

22:18.293 --> 22:20.262
- Here we go.
- Frank!

22:29.233 --> 22:31.182
I guess some men just
don't have what it takes,

22:31.183 --> 22:33.223
do they, boys?

22:48.293 --> 22:50.142
Congress also amended

22:50.143 --> 22:51.242
the National Labor Relations Act

22:51.243 --> 22:53.252
as part of the same piece of legislation

22:53.253 --> 22:56.182
that prohibits against
secondary boycotts,

22:56.183 --> 22:58.112
prohibiting certain types of...

23:37.173 --> 23:39.122
Uh, hate to bother you.

23:39.123 --> 23:40.232
I ain't got any money, so...

23:40.233 --> 23:44.142
Oh, no, no, this is not a sales call.

23:44.143 --> 23:47.102
Actually you're a winner.

23:47.103 --> 23:49.252
- Doris Dunning, right?
- Yeah.

23:49.253 --> 23:51.282
Yeah? Great.

23:51.283 --> 23:56.243
Well, I am J. Epping with the
Howard Johnson organization.

23:58.313 --> 24:02.172
Um, I'm here to deliver
you a prize package.

24:02.173 --> 24:03.292
We won something?

24:03.293 --> 24:05.142
Hush, Harry.

24:05.143 --> 24:08.182
You sure have.

24:08.183 --> 24:10.262
Sorry to see your son's
not feeling well.

24:10.263 --> 24:13.102
Seems like he's feeling
better all of a sudden.

24:13.103 --> 24:14.222
Well, he should feel better,

24:14.223 --> 24:16.322
because it's not every
day that his family

24:16.323 --> 24:19.202
wins an all-expense-paid weekend

24:19.203 --> 24:22.132
to the Landmark for Hungry Americans,

24:22.133 --> 24:27.112
and tickets to the Lexington
Halloween Festival are included.

24:27.113 --> 24:29.222
And Halloween's only a day away.

24:29.223 --> 24:31.092
- What's the catch?
- No catch.

24:31.093 --> 24:32.202
We just ask that you
fill out our survey.

24:32.203 --> 24:34.182
Be as detailed as possible.

24:34.183 --> 24:35.322
We know we can always be improving.

24:35.323 --> 24:37.282
They got 28 ice cream flavors.

24:37.283 --> 24:39.232
Mama, I've seen it on TV.

24:39.233 --> 24:42.132
They sure do, kiddo.

24:42.133 --> 24:45.312
I just don't know what
we did to deserve this.

24:45.313 --> 24:51.162
Sometimes fate just steps in
and deals you a good hand.

24:51.163 --> 24:53.183
I like the sound of that.

24:57.103 --> 24:58.302
So how many will be joining you?

24:58.303 --> 25:00.222
Myself and three kids.

25:00.223 --> 25:02.172
One adult, three children.

25:02.173 --> 25:05.142
- No other adults?
- Nope, just me.

25:05.143 --> 25:06.292
Great.

25:06.293 --> 25:09.302
And I hear that there is a...

25:09.303 --> 25:12.302
costume contest in the
lobby, if you're interested.

25:12.303 --> 25:14.312
I'm gonna be Buffalo Bob.

25:14.313 --> 25:16.162
That sounds swell.

25:16.163 --> 25:20.192
Now, enjoy your visit, and don't worry.

25:20.193 --> 25:22.323
Things are about to get a
whole lot better, Harry.

25:35.133 --> 25:36.222
And the Nixon campaign,

25:36.223 --> 25:38.172
reaching an interesting point.

25:38.173 --> 25:40.242
When "Time" magazine asked
President Eisenhower

25:40.243 --> 25:42.282
for an example of a
major idea of Nixon's

25:42.283 --> 25:45.312
that he had adopted as part
of a decision-making process,

25:45.313 --> 25:48.132
the President's response was...

25:48.133 --> 25:49.292
If you give me a
week, I might think of one.

25:49.293 --> 25:52.152
I don't remember."

25:52.153 --> 25:53.232
At the same press conference,

25:53.233 --> 25:56.102
President Eisenhower said...

25:56.103 --> 25:58.112
Mrs. Price, thank you for this food.

25:58.113 --> 26:00.102
It's great.

26:00.103 --> 26:02.202
I'm glad you like it.

26:02.203 --> 26:05.262
I got the recipe right off the can.

26:05.263 --> 26:08.212
Arliss, what do you think?

26:08.213 --> 26:11.292
It tastes like cream of mushroom soup.

26:11.293 --> 26:15.162
The paprika is supposed to
give it that Hungarian flavor.

26:15.163 --> 26:20.132
That's the Hungarian part of the gulash.

26:20.133 --> 26:22.282
Soup.

26:22.283 --> 26:25.232
He's a picky eater.

26:25.233 --> 26:27.142
President Eisenhower
could not remember...

26:27.143 --> 26:28.292
Oh, Ike.

26:28.293 --> 26:31.322
I'd vote for Ike again if he ran.

26:31.323 --> 26:34.092
Arliss served under him in WWII.

26:34.093 --> 26:35.202
Everybody served under him, Edna.

26:35.203 --> 26:38.132
- It's no big deal.
- It was a big deal.

26:38.133 --> 26:41.102
Arliss got the Bronze Star for bravery.

26:41.103 --> 26:42.252
- Wow.
- That's what I said.

26:42.253 --> 26:44.292
I wanted to frame it and
put it up in the house,

26:44.293 --> 26:47.252
- but he won't let me.
- You serve?

26:47.253 --> 26:51.282
Uh, yeah, Korea, two tours.

26:51.283 --> 26:55.242
That right? What unit?

26:55.243 --> 26:59.123
MASH, 4077th.

27:01.263 --> 27:04.282
- A little coffee?
- Yes.

27:04.283 --> 27:07.172
All right.

27:07.173 --> 27:09.112
This.

27:09.113 --> 27:10.252
Thank you.

27:20.173 --> 27:24.112
Then we both know the truth.

27:24.113 --> 27:25.283
What's that?

27:28.193 --> 27:32.172
There ain't no such thing as a war hero.

27:32.173 --> 27:34.272
Oh, right.

27:34.273 --> 27:40.212
Well, hell, sometimes people
have to do terrible things

27:40.213 --> 27:45.122
in order to make the world
a better place, and...

27:45.123 --> 27:48.143
that's a kind of heroism, right?

27:51.313 --> 27:54.262
You want to hear about the Bronze Star?

27:54.263 --> 27:58.172
Sure.

27:58.173 --> 28:02.223
It was in Sicily, part
of that whole mess.

28:05.203 --> 28:08.102
Me and two fellas got
separated from our squad,

28:08.103 --> 28:12.252
ended up pinned down behind some rocks.

28:12.253 --> 28:15.173
Nazis were handing us our asses.

28:18.173 --> 28:20.112
My pal, Fuzzy Bracowicz,

28:20.113 --> 28:23.212
he took a shot in the head

28:23.213 --> 28:25.323
just above the right eye.

28:29.113 --> 28:31.313
Part of his scalp went down my shirt.

28:34.143 --> 28:35.192
I tried everything I could.

28:35.193 --> 28:38.183
I...I couldn't get it out.

28:42.113 --> 28:45.292
Other fella, Ernie Calvert,
he... he twisted his ankle

28:45.293 --> 28:49.233
when we took cover, so he was...
He was completely useless.

28:53.293 --> 28:56.173
When it got dark, they
let off for some reason.

28:59.193 --> 29:03.212
So I hauled Ernie onto my
back and made a run for it.

29:03.213 --> 29:05.122
Ended up down at the river.

29:05.123 --> 29:08.283
Seemed like... seemed like
we were in the clear.

29:14.143 --> 29:17.252
That's when I saw him.

29:17.253 --> 29:21.292
German kid.

29:21.293 --> 29:25.092
Couldn't have been more than 17.

29:25.093 --> 29:29.252
Asleep on the bank.

29:29.253 --> 29:33.252
Wandered away from his
unit, I don't know.

29:33.253 --> 29:37.313
I could've just gone
on, left him there...

29:39.303 --> 29:41.232
But I kept thinking, "Maybe he's the one

29:41.233 --> 29:46.092
who pulled the trigger on Fuzzy."

29:46.093 --> 29:48.302
After the fact, you always...

29:48.303 --> 29:51.143
tell yourself there was a good reason.

29:59.213 --> 30:01.302
Anyway, I put Ernie down,

30:01.303 --> 30:06.282
went over and dragged the
kid to the water's edge.

30:06.283 --> 30:09.282
He was so sleepy...

30:09.283 --> 30:14.212
he didn't even wake up...

30:14.213 --> 30:18.232
till I put his head under the water.

30:18.233 --> 30:20.203
Then his eyes opened.

30:23.213 --> 30:26.313
Strange though, he...

30:28.143 --> 30:30.252
He didn't struggle at all.

30:30.253 --> 30:36.242
He just looked up,

30:36.243 --> 30:41.232
looked up through the mud and the silt,

30:41.233 --> 30:46.112
his face the color of a fish's belly.

30:46.113 --> 30:49.102
Then he opened his mouth
and said something

30:49.103 --> 30:53.182
just before he died.

30:53.183 --> 30:56.292
In German.

30:56.293 --> 30:59.123
I don't know what. I don't speak Kraut.

31:03.253 --> 31:06.102
After a while,

31:06.103 --> 31:08.242
I pushed him out into the river,
let the current take him.

31:21.153 --> 31:25.162
I picked up Ernie and
headed off into the woods.

31:25.163 --> 31:30.102
Hour later, we found the
rest of the division.

31:30.103 --> 31:32.182
Next morning, CO comes into my tent,

31:32.183 --> 31:34.303
tells me he's gonna put me up for the...

31:39.163 --> 31:41.397
Put me up for the Bronze Star.

31:45.203 --> 31:49.212
Last thing you can say
about killing a man

31:49.213 --> 31:52.203
is that it's brave.

32:05.143 --> 32:06.323
I'll get it.

32:12.163 --> 32:14.112
Edna,

32:14.113 --> 32:16.192
what a delight it is to see you.

32:16.193 --> 32:17.272
Mr. Dunning.

32:17.273 --> 32:19.152
Yeah, I'm looking for a buddy of mine

32:19.153 --> 32:21.132
who said he was staying here.

32:21.133 --> 32:24.302
Mr. Amberson didn't inform me
that he was expecting guests.

32:24.303 --> 32:27.282
Yeah, I just figured I'd drop in.

32:27.283 --> 32:29.172
You know, that's the kind of guy I am.

32:29.173 --> 32:32.142
And which kind is that?

32:32.143 --> 32:34.132
It's all right, Mrs. Price.

32:34.133 --> 32:37.283
Jakey, how you doing, buddy?

32:39.283 --> 32:41.262
Yeah, I feel like maybe we got off

32:41.263 --> 32:43.242
- on the wrong foot last night.
- I'm fine.

32:43.243 --> 32:47.182
No, no, I'd like to make it up to you.

32:47.183 --> 32:50.192
Come on, pal.

32:50.193 --> 32:52.203
Come on, it'll be fun.

32:54.303 --> 32:57.312
Okay.

32:57.313 --> 33:01.302
All right.

33:01.303 --> 33:03.202
Edna, always a pleasure.

33:03.203 --> 33:05.282
You men think I don't
know what's going on,

33:05.283 --> 33:08.093
but I know.

33:15.323 --> 33:17.262
And don't you go spitting that out.

33:17.263 --> 33:19.172
I made it fresh this morning.

33:19.173 --> 33:21.282
I hope you cleaned the
bathtub out beforehand.

33:23.233 --> 33:24.292
That's what I like about you, Jake.

33:24.293 --> 33:26.192
You're a funny guy.

33:26.193 --> 33:28.192
Sense of humor's important,
don't you think?

33:28.193 --> 33:30.122
I do.

33:30.123 --> 33:32.212
You know, we're not all
rubes down here, you know?

33:32.213 --> 33:35.122
Some of us have good qualities, values.

33:35.123 --> 33:37.092
- I never thought otherwise.
- That's good to hear.

33:37.093 --> 33:39.182
- Hey, you like steak?
- Yeah.

33:39.183 --> 33:42.093
Then I got something for you.

33:58.233 --> 34:01.322
My pride and joy.

34:01.323 --> 34:06.222
Best goddamn butcher shop in the county.

34:06.223 --> 34:10.232
Finally worked my way out of the
slaughterhouse with this baby.

34:10.233 --> 34:13.152
Never looked back.

34:13.152 --> 34:14.181
Nice.

34:14.183 --> 34:16.152
Yeah.

34:16.152 --> 34:19.092
Yup.

34:19.092 --> 34:21.181
You know what I like most about it?

34:21.183 --> 34:23.101
What?

34:23.103 --> 34:26.103
It's my place, my rules.

34:28.152 --> 34:30.212
It's rules that hold
the universe together.

34:30.213 --> 34:32.322
- Am I right?
- I guess.

34:32.322 --> 34:36.243
Yeah, yeah, so you understand
how this world works.

34:39.132 --> 34:43.092
When rules are broken,
there's a price, right?

34:45.112 --> 34:47.193
Without that, everything
else just falls apart.

34:49.223 --> 34:52.312
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

34:52.313 --> 34:56.183
A price must be paid
to set things right.

35:00.143 --> 35:01.313
All right, come on out now.

35:06.253 --> 35:09.172
- Come on!
- Oh, no, Frank...

35:09.173 --> 35:11.242
Come on, don't be shy. Get over here.

35:11.243 --> 35:13.223
Frank, please.

35:19.133 --> 35:21.262
Show him.

35:21.263 --> 35:22.323
Show him.

35:29.233 --> 35:31.252
No, no, look, Frank.

35:31.253 --> 35:34.132
Frank, this is... It's
not what you think.

35:34.133 --> 35:35.253
No?

35:37.273 --> 35:40.183
Because it looks to me like
you're trying to fuck my wife.

35:49.133 --> 35:51.172
Okay, it's what I was doing,

35:51.173 --> 35:54.232
but she didn't know
anything about it, okay?

35:54.233 --> 35:56.092
She had nothing to do with it.

35:56.093 --> 35:59.262
Ah!

35:59.263 --> 36:03.112
Frank, please!

36:03.113 --> 36:04.253
Grand prize winner.

36:06.253 --> 36:09.142
Take it from me.

36:09.143 --> 36:11.252
She ain't worth it. Now, get up.

36:21.163 --> 36:23.302
Now, if I were you, I'd get in
that faggot yellow car of yours,

36:23.303 --> 36:27.103
drive away from this town,
and don't ever look back.

36:49.193 --> 36:55.132
Doris, I'm...

36:55.133 --> 36:57.113
I'm sorry.

37:28.233 --> 37:31.142
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey,
I just need a minute.

37:31.143 --> 37:32.322
- Just a minute.
- Closed.

37:32.323 --> 37:35.202
Look, I'll make it worth
your while... cash.

37:35.203 --> 37:37.142
Cash money, okay?

37:37.143 --> 37:39.262
I need a gun, just a little gun.

37:39.263 --> 37:42.312
I'll take that gun. That's it.

37:42.313 --> 37:46.132
What you planning to do with it?

37:46.133 --> 37:47.272
Shoot cans.

37:47.273 --> 37:51.112
That'd be an awful waste of $20.

37:51.113 --> 37:53.093
$20.

37:55.123 --> 37:57.322
How about two 20s?

37:57.323 --> 38:00.112
- No.
- No?

38:00.113 --> 38:02.102
I don't think I will.

38:02.103 --> 38:05.152
Man looking like you do
coming around at night

38:05.153 --> 38:07.182
looking to buy a firearm?

38:07.183 --> 38:09.143
Nothing good can come of it.

38:12.173 --> 38:13.233
You're not gonna sell me the gun?

38:16.273 --> 38:19.172
God damn it. Look, I need this gun.

38:19.173 --> 38:21.302
Hell, son.

38:21.303 --> 38:24.152
What?

38:24.153 --> 38:27.112
Can't you take a joke?

38:27.113 --> 38:29.102
I'll sell you five guns.

38:29.103 --> 38:31.153
Come on.

38:48.223 --> 38:52.142
Happy fucking Halloween, Frank Dunning.

38:52.143 --> 38:55.232
I'm coming for you.

38:55.233 --> 38:57.222
Al, I've got a question.

38:57.223 --> 39:02.102
What's this thing about the past
doesn't want to be changed?

39:02.103 --> 39:04.142
Like, it pushes back?

39:04.143 --> 39:05.312
How do you know?

39:05.313 --> 39:09.192
You feel it.

39:09.193 --> 39:12.152
When I first started going
through the rabbit hole,

39:12.153 --> 39:16.252
I saw a news story
about a girl in Lisbon

39:16.253 --> 39:22.152
who got shot and crippled in
a random hunting accident,

39:22.153 --> 39:27.102
and I thought, "Hell, there's no harm.

39:27.103 --> 39:29.312
Let me try to keep this from happening."

39:29.313 --> 39:33.152
And every time I tried,
something would come up.

39:33.153 --> 39:35.152
I'd get a flat tire,

39:35.153 --> 39:39.212
a fender bender, a
little tree in the road.

39:39.213 --> 39:42.102
Lost count of the times I tried.

39:45.133 --> 39:48.102
I know it sounds strange,

39:48.103 --> 39:51.212
like mysticism or some horseshit,

39:51.213 --> 39:55.222
but things would happen,

39:55.223 --> 40:01.112
and they were both random and, oh...

40:01.113 --> 40:03.122
not random at all.

40:03.123 --> 40:05.182
- Violent.
- Are you sure?

40:05.183 --> 40:08.162
I mean, don't you think we
see what we want to see?

40:08.163 --> 40:13.323
Listen, I didn't have
cancer before I went in.

40:17.303 --> 40:20.182
You... are you telling me that
the past gave you cancer?

40:20.183 --> 40:22.282
All I can tell you is I got

40:22.283 --> 40:26.142
a full check-up the month
before my last trip,

40:26.143 --> 40:27.323
and nothing was wrong with me.

40:54.113 --> 40:56.202
The past.

40:56.203 --> 41:01.272
Think a little food poisoning,
a little flu is gonna stop me?

41:01.273 --> 41:04.202
You coming for me?

41:04.203 --> 41:06.202
Not today.

41:06.203 --> 41:08.282
Okay.

41:08.283 --> 41:13.122
Uh, right.

41:13.123 --> 41:15.302
Uh, hey, do you have any...
Do you have Gatorade?

41:15.303 --> 41:17.232
Gate or... I'm sorry, what was it?

41:17.233 --> 41:19.142
No, forget it, forget it, forget it.

41:19.143 --> 41:21.092
Just this. This will be fine.
This will be fine.

41:21.093 --> 41:22.172
You feeling a little under the weather?

41:22.173 --> 41:24.092
Yes, sir. Yes, I am.

41:24.093 --> 41:26.172
Well, I suggest a diet of white foods.

41:26.173 --> 41:29.252
- What?
- Bananas, breads, rice.

41:29.253 --> 41:31.242
I suggest we just hurry this up,

41:31.243 --> 41:34.152
or I'm gonna have to put these
on right here, right now.

41:34.153 --> 41:35.322
Please, thank you. Please, thank you.

41:35.323 --> 41:37.182
- All right then, come on.
- Thank you, thank you.

41:37.183 --> 41:41.152
"Anyway, he came in the door.

41:41.153 --> 41:43.292
"I was in my bedroom,

41:43.293 --> 41:49.112
"and then I heard my mother say...

41:49.113 --> 41:51.222
"'Get out of here with that thing.

41:51.223 --> 41:55.102
"You're not supposed to be here.'

41:55.103 --> 42:00.132
"The next thing was she was screaming,

42:00.133 --> 42:04.132
and then they were all screaming."

42:46.103 --> 42:48.212
Trick or treat!

43:00.263 --> 43:03.212
Trick or treat!

43:13.143 --> 43:14.202
Hurry up, it's dark already.

43:14.203 --> 43:15.252
We got to get started.

43:15.253 --> 43:16.302
Hold your horses.

43:16.303 --> 43:18.162
I got to get Ellen in her costume,

43:18.163 --> 43:20.172
and then we'll go.

43:20.173 --> 43:23.242
Why can't I just take
Tugga and y'all catch up?

43:23.243 --> 43:31.142
Ellen, honey, help your
brother with his costume.

43:31.143 --> 43:32.212
You can take your...

43:32.213 --> 43:34.132
both: Toy rifle if you want to, Harry.

43:34.133 --> 43:35.132
It's not a real gun...

43:35.133 --> 43:36.242
Or even shoot pretend bullets.

43:36.243 --> 43:38.223
Buffalo Bob wouldn't mind.

43:41.253 --> 43:45.172
"It was the last thing
she ever said to me.

43:45.173 --> 43:49.322
I'm glad it was a nice thing,
because she was real strict."

43:49.323 --> 43:51.182
Let's go, baby.

43:51.183 --> 43:54.232
Halloween only comes but once a year.

43:54.233 --> 43:55.213
You ain't going nowhere.

44:00.203 --> 44:02.312
- What are you doing?
- I'm asking you the same thing.

44:02.313 --> 44:04.192
I'm trying to help them.

44:04.193 --> 44:06.152
What are you, Frank's watchdog?

44:06.153 --> 44:08.202
Hardly. I hate that son of a bitch.

44:08.203 --> 44:10.242
All right, so do I. Listen, so do I.

44:10.243 --> 44:12.122
You got to listen to me, okay?

44:12.123 --> 44:15.262
Frank Dunning is coming
here to kill Doris

44:15.263 --> 44:18.322
and the kids at 8:00, okay?

44:18.323 --> 44:21.222
They're gonna die at 8:00,
and I'm trying to stop him.

44:21.223 --> 44:22.312
Did he tell you that?

44:22.313 --> 44:25.092
No, no, it's complicated.

44:25.093 --> 44:26.262
'Cause he killed my sister.

44:26.263 --> 44:28.192
What?

44:28.193 --> 44:31.192
Frank was married to
my older sister Clara.

44:31.193 --> 44:34.262
He killed her 12 years ago and
buried her body somewhere,

44:34.263 --> 44:36.232
her and the baby.

44:36.233 --> 44:38.292
Nobody believes me 'cause I
was just a kid at the time,

44:38.293 --> 44:40.282
- but I know it's true.
- I believe you.

44:40.283 --> 44:42.192
Listen to me, he's gonna do it again.

44:42.193 --> 44:43.322
He's gonna do it again.

44:43.323 --> 44:45.232
Now, you want to stop him, okay?

44:45.233 --> 44:47.202
Now, you don't just
walk up and kill a man.

44:47.203 --> 44:49.292
Sometimes you do, and
right now is the time.

44:49.293 --> 44:51.092
You don't know what's gonna happen.

44:51.093 --> 44:52.312
- I do. I know.
- How? How?

44:52.313 --> 44:55.132
You said you knew Frank, but I
don't believe you for a minute.

44:55.133 --> 44:56.322
How do you know anything's
gonna happen to Doris?

44:56.323 --> 44:58.312
I'm from the future, okay?

44:58.313 --> 45:01.252
I know Harry Dunning
in the future, okay?

45:01.253 --> 45:03.162
Well, that's it.

45:03.163 --> 45:04.282
You're just bat-shit crazy.

45:04.283 --> 45:08.222
Okay, okay, stay down.

45:08.223 --> 45:09.312
- Okay, all right.
- Stay down.

45:09.313 --> 45:13.202
Okay, time travel man, no need for that.

45:13.203 --> 45:15.192
You want to kill Frank? Kill Frank.

45:15.193 --> 45:17.292
I won't stop you.

45:17.293 --> 45:19.282
It seems to me like maybe
you got something wrong

45:19.283 --> 45:21.092
in your story.

45:21.093 --> 45:22.222
What?

45:22.223 --> 45:24.242
It's 8:05.

45:24.243 --> 45:25.223
What?

45:31.113 --> 45:33.252
Maybe I fixed it...

45:33.253 --> 45:35.312
just by being here.

45:35.313 --> 45:38.192
No.

45:38.193 --> 45:40.112
Get that thing out of here!

45:40.113 --> 45:41.253
He went through the back door.

45:49.093 --> 45:54.172
"The Cheyenne Show."

45:54.173 --> 45:59.112
Starring Clint Walker as Cheyenne...

46:00.283 --> 46:02.143
You're hurting me!

46:03.273 --> 46:07.112
Harry.

46:17.143 --> 46:20.172
Hey.

46:20.173 --> 46:22.292
You all right? Yeah?

46:22.293 --> 46:24.242
All right, Harry, listen to me.

46:24.243 --> 46:26.282
You have to promise me,
no matter what happens,

46:26.283 --> 46:29.312
you will not come out of there, okay?

46:33.183 --> 46:35.312
Shh, stay here.

46:35.313 --> 46:37.252
No, please!

46:45.103 --> 46:49.172
Frank!

46:49.173 --> 46:50.273
You shouldn't be here.

47:23.183 --> 47:26.262
Run! Run, run!

47:26.263 --> 47:27.302
- Don't you run!
- Run!

47:27.303 --> 47:29.293
God damn it, get back here!

47:41.233 --> 47:44.242
Harry, Harry, why don't
you bring me that hammer.

47:44.243 --> 47:48.172
- Run, Harry!
- Give me that fucking hammer!

47:48.173 --> 47:50.292
Harry! Give me that fucking hammer!

47:50.293 --> 47:52.282
Give me that...

47:52.283 --> 47:55.182
Give me that fucking hammer, boy!

47:55.183 --> 47:57.162
Come here, Harry!

47:57.163 --> 48:01.092
You give me that fucking
hammer, you little shit!

48:06.293 --> 48:08.283
Bill, help me!

48:11.143 --> 48:12.282
Aah!

48:19.293 --> 48:22.182
Ah!

48:50.133 --> 48:52.183
Shh.

49:02.103 --> 49:05.152
Don't go in the bedroom.

49:05.153 --> 49:09.162
Everything okay in here?

49:09.163 --> 49:11.092
Where's Doris?

49:11.093 --> 49:12.323
Somebody thought they heard shots.

49:17.273 --> 49:19.213
Is that real blood?

49:46.183 --> 49:49.222
Mr. Amberson.

49:49.223 --> 49:54.132
Mrs. Price.

49:54.133 --> 49:57.122
You done trick-or-treating?

49:57.123 --> 49:59.182
I just want to leave.

49:59.183 --> 50:01.272
Looks like I might owe
the sheriff a call.

50:01.273 --> 50:04.102
Please don't.

50:04.103 --> 50:07.093
No matter what this looks like,
I didn't do a bad thing.

50:11.103 --> 50:15.172
God knows what's in your heart,
Mr. Amberson.

50:15.173 --> 50:20.262
He'll be the final judge.

50:20.263 --> 50:23.242
I hope you're prepared for that.

51:55.193 --> 51:57.242
Doris.

51:57.243 --> 51:59.232
Tugga.

51:59.233 --> 52:02.092
Ellen.

52:02.093 --> 52:06.302
They're still alive.
They're still alive.

52:06.303 --> 52:10.192
They're still alive.

52:10.193 --> 52:13.263
Doris, Tugga, and Ellen.

52:33.113 --> 52:34.233
It worked.

52:38.223 --> 52:40.283
It worked.

52:48.233 --> 52:50.173
Hey!

52:57.293 --> 52:59.262
What the hell is this?

53:05.193 --> 53:07.172
Get in.
