WEBVTT

00:06.789 --> 00:08.423
Like, how you
feeling, pal?

00:09.707 --> 00:11.875
Never better.

00:14.669 --> 00:16.536
Great. I was worried
there for a sec

00:16.604 --> 00:18.138
we'd have
to leave you behind.

00:18.205 --> 00:19.606
Fred!
What?

00:19.674 --> 00:21.841
The mystery solver
state finals is tomorrow.

00:21.909 --> 00:23.243
Every team
mystery solving

00:23.310 --> 00:25.879
group from around
the country will be there.

00:25.946 --> 00:27.881
You mean there's more
than one of us?

00:27.948 --> 00:29.949
It's being held
right here in Crystal Cove.

00:30.017 --> 00:33.053
Whoever wins will be declared
the best mystery solving team

00:33.120 --> 00:35.155
and go on to compete
in the Olympics!

00:35.222 --> 00:37.991
Olympics?
I don't think that's right.

00:38.059 --> 00:40.760
Well, I'm sure the prize will
be something big and Greek.

00:40.828 --> 00:43.530
I'm sorry, Fred,
but we can't go to the finals

00:43.597 --> 00:46.700
with Scooby sick like this.

00:46.767 --> 00:49.469
Oh, right.
No. Of course not.

00:49.537 --> 00:51.738
Will you excuse me
a second?

00:54.108 --> 00:57.243
Nooo!

00:57.311 --> 00:59.312
Why?

00:59.380 --> 01:01.047
Why, why?!

01:01.115 --> 01:05.084
Don't worry, Scoob. I got just
what you need.

01:05.152 --> 01:06.820
Chicken soup.

01:06.887 --> 01:09.022
Here.

01:09.090 --> 01:11.291
Huh? Wha-choo!

01:13.761 --> 01:16.529
Sorry. Maybe...

01:16.597 --> 01:18.898
You guys should
go without me.

01:18.966 --> 01:19.866
Wha-choo!

01:19.934 --> 01:22.435
No, you're part
of the team, Scooby.

01:22.503 --> 01:24.370
What good are we
without our sidekick?

01:24.438 --> 01:26.539
Sidekick?

01:26.607 --> 01:28.942
Velma!
What she means is--

01:29.009 --> 01:31.344
I know what she means.

01:31.412 --> 01:32.345
Ah, come on, gang.

01:32.413 --> 01:34.881
Let's let him
get some sleep.

01:36.851 --> 01:39.219
Hmmph.

01:39.286 --> 01:41.454
Sidekick.

01:41.522 --> 01:44.691
Is that all I am?

01:49.430 --> 01:51.731
Oooh-oh.

01:51.799 --> 01:54.968
Hmm, ahhh.

01:55.035 --> 01:57.737
Wahh-uhh--oh!

01:57.805 --> 02:00.406
I didn't sneeze!

02:04.011 --> 02:05.478
Normal.

02:05.546 --> 02:07.647
I'm cured!

02:07.715 --> 02:10.350
I'm cured! I'm cured!

02:10.417 --> 02:12.452
Ha ha, like, what?

02:12.520 --> 02:14.020
Way to go, Scoob!

02:14.088 --> 02:15.855
Must have been
that chicken soup.

02:15.923 --> 02:17.157
I'll say.

02:17.224 --> 02:18.758
Well, what are we
waiting for, gang?

02:18.826 --> 02:22.829
We've got a mystery
solvers club state finals to win.

02:30.237 --> 02:32.372
Oh, man,
this is going to be great.

02:32.439 --> 02:34.274
I can't wait to meet our--

02:34.341 --> 02:36.609
huh?

Scooby Dooby Doo!

03:34.568 --> 03:36.870
So, are you guys the other--

03:36.937 --> 03:40.106
the word you're looking
for is "sidekicks", don't you know.

03:40.174 --> 03:44.344
I'm the Funky Phantom,
and this is Boo.

03:44.411 --> 03:45.578
I'm Jabberjaw.

03:45.646 --> 03:48.514
Hugga bugga!
Me Captain Caveman,

03:48.582 --> 03:50.750
big smash!

03:50.818 --> 03:54.254
Speed Buggy!

03:54.321 --> 03:57.490
I'm sorry, but,
uh, are you a car?

03:57.558 --> 03:59.692
Woman on P.A.:
Attention, everyone, attention.

03:59.760 --> 04:01.194
If you could
all take your seats.

04:02.963 --> 04:05.431
I want to welcome you all
to the competition.

04:05.499 --> 04:08.034
I'll be honest--
mystery solving is not really

04:08.102 --> 04:09.402
a priority for me,

04:09.470 --> 04:11.070
or anyone else
in Crystal Cove.

04:11.138 --> 04:13.373
But the school district
made a healthy contribution

04:13.440 --> 04:14.974
to put on this event,

04:15.042 --> 04:17.410
so Mayor Jones encouraged me
to take their money.

04:17.478 --> 04:19.077
Go, dad!

04:19.146 --> 04:20.880
The mayor's
my dad.

04:20.947 --> 04:23.016
You guys might
as well give up right now.

04:23.083 --> 04:24.851
Also, after the dinner,

04:24.919 --> 04:29.188
we'll be having a mixer
DJed by Kghoul's Angel Dynamite.

04:29.256 --> 04:30.723
Word, mystery solvers.

04:30.791 --> 04:33.226
Angel Dynamite's going to be
spinning some mad licorice,

04:33.294 --> 04:36.296
so watch out! Hey now!

04:36.363 --> 04:39.065
Ugh. But before
we begin all this joy,

04:39.133 --> 04:42.135
I'm sure you'd like to find out
what we've all come here for.

04:45.639 --> 04:47.674
Tonight's mystery is...

04:47.741 --> 04:50.610
You're doomed!

04:50.678 --> 04:53.279
I'm Lord Infernicus,
and there's been

04:53.347 --> 04:56.082
a little change in plans!

04:56.150 --> 04:58.518
Ah ha ha!

05:00.754 --> 05:02.822
Huh?

05:02.890 --> 05:05.792
Hey, where is everyone?

05:05.859 --> 05:08.127
Raggy?
Boo?

05:08.195 --> 05:10.096
Rugga bugga?!

05:10.164 --> 05:12.432
Puhh?

05:12.499 --> 05:17.236
Your friends are hidden
somewhere in this building.

05:17.304 --> 05:20.173
All communication with the
outside world is cut off.

05:20.240 --> 05:23.076
If you try to leave
or call for help,

05:23.143 --> 05:25.111
you'll never see them again!

05:25.179 --> 05:27.447
You have until sunrise
to find them.

05:27.514 --> 05:30.183
Good luck!

05:31.719 --> 05:33.619
Oooh! My heart
is racing!

05:33.687 --> 05:34.954
I can't breathe!

05:35.022 --> 05:36.189
I'm going down.

05:36.256 --> 05:38.191
Whoo-whoo-whoo-
whoo-whoo!

05:38.258 --> 05:40.893
Oh, he's hy--hy--
hyperventilating,

05:40.961 --> 05:42.295
don't you know?

05:42.363 --> 05:44.964
Oh, me help
big fish calm down!

05:45.032 --> 05:47.533
No, wait!

05:57.144 --> 05:58.244
Thanks.

05:58.312 --> 06:00.079
Oh, boy,
that hit the spot.

06:01.448 --> 06:03.383
Dead. Flame Face
wasn't lyin'.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.318
Something is
jamming the phones.

06:05.386 --> 06:09.022
Principle Quinlan, is there any
other way to get a message out?

06:09.089 --> 06:12.025
Principle Quinlan?

06:14.428 --> 06:16.662
Principal!

06:16.730 --> 06:18.931
Leave me alone!

06:18.999 --> 06:20.133
Let me hide in peace!

06:20.200 --> 06:22.101
Communications
are jammed.

06:22.169 --> 06:24.203
We need to unjam
them, now!

06:24.271 --> 06:27.774
Well, there is a communication
tower over the gym.

06:27.841 --> 06:29.475
Infernicus warned us!

06:29.543 --> 06:31.878
No communication
with the outside world!

06:31.945 --> 06:33.413
Yeah!

06:33.480 --> 06:36.349
Scooby,
little help here?

06:37.251 --> 06:39.485
Uh, Angel's right.

06:39.553 --> 06:41.354
We need help.

06:41.422 --> 06:42.955
Teach, lead the way.

06:43.023 --> 06:45.158
Dune Buggy, since
we're in a hurry,

06:45.225 --> 06:46.592
how about you
give us a ride?

06:48.262 --> 06:50.530
Wait!

06:50.597 --> 06:52.498
What do we do?

06:52.566 --> 06:54.934
You're a dog, dawg.
Sniff out some clues.

06:55.002 --> 06:57.603
Ain't that what
you mystery solvers do?

07:00.741 --> 07:03.776
Mystery solvers? Us?

07:03.844 --> 07:05.278
Me find teenagers!

07:05.345 --> 07:10.316
Captain Caveman!

07:15.956 --> 07:17.123
Eehhee!

07:17.191 --> 07:18.691
Phhbbtt.

07:18.759 --> 07:20.927
What's that?

07:20.994 --> 07:24.263
Wood shavings? A clue!

07:24.331 --> 07:26.532
Oh, that could
be anything, anything!

07:26.600 --> 07:28.935
Leftovers from some
beaver making a nest

07:29.002 --> 07:31.838
or a whittler carving some
nesting dolls, even.

07:31.905 --> 07:33.206
Huh?!

07:33.273 --> 07:35.208
Heavens to Delaware,

07:35.275 --> 07:38.177
don't forget
the Funky Phantom!

07:42.741 --> 07:46.143
Whoa!

07:47.515 --> 07:49.015
It is so against
school policy

07:49.083 --> 07:50.717
to have a dune buggy
on the roof.

07:50.785 --> 07:52.719
Kids are in danger,
you dig?

07:52.787 --> 07:55.221
You know, you're very robust
for a woman.

07:55.289 --> 07:59.192
You're like those female wrestlers
on TV, except not so vein-y.

07:59.260 --> 08:00.460
Is that it?

08:00.528 --> 08:03.396
Yes, that's the school's
communication tower.

08:03.464 --> 08:07.634
My predecessor Principal Scrim installed
it in the hopes of getting free cable.

08:09.503 --> 08:10.470
Yeah!

08:16.377 --> 08:19.245
In here.

08:29.390 --> 08:31.024
Hold on
to my horses!

08:31.092 --> 08:33.960
This mystery just got hairier,
don't you know?

08:35.363 --> 08:38.063
Infernicus turned our friends
into guinea pigs!

08:51.479 --> 08:52.746
Shaggy?

08:52.813 --> 08:54.114
Can you hear me?

08:54.181 --> 08:57.617
Drop one plant for yes,
and two for no.

08:59.053 --> 09:01.921
Would you do it
for a Scooby snack?

09:01.989 --> 09:04.157
Aooo!

09:04.225 --> 09:07.894
That is not shaggy,
no way, uh-uh.

09:07.962 --> 09:10.597
What are you saying?
Of course it is.

09:10.665 --> 09:13.500
Let's face facts, huh?
Our friends are gone.

09:13.567 --> 09:16.036
Possibly never
coming back, even!

09:16.103 --> 09:19.506
Teenagers no more
coming Harry?

09:19.573 --> 09:21.541
And watch gave
the incentive bath?

09:21.609 --> 09:25.045
And pig freeze out
of cavey-hair?

09:25.112 --> 09:26.479
When me not like,

09:26.547 --> 09:29.716
me get primal
urge to smash!

09:31.585 --> 09:33.319
Enough,
enough already!

09:33.387 --> 09:35.188
Someone needs
to take charge of this mystery,

09:35.256 --> 09:37.057
don't you know?

09:37.124 --> 09:41.127
And obviously, you're not
the dog to do it! Snap!

09:41.195 --> 09:44.564
Yeah? Well, who died
and put you in charge?

09:45.566 --> 09:47.167
Ooh, heh, sorry.

09:47.234 --> 09:49.102
Where are you going?

09:49.170 --> 09:51.237
To the library
to find a way

09:51.305 --> 09:52.439
to change them back.

09:52.506 --> 09:54.541
Post hastey pudding.

09:57.378 --> 09:59.112
Who to follow?

09:59.180 --> 10:00.747
Dog or fappish ghost?

10:00.815 --> 10:02.415
How should I know?

10:02.483 --> 10:04.217
I'm just a shark
from the future.

10:04.285 --> 10:05.919
Ra ra ra.

10:09.657 --> 10:11.991
Don't you think
we found them a little easy?

10:12.059 --> 10:13.793
And why guinea pigs?

10:13.861 --> 10:15.195
Give it up, Scooby Doo.

10:15.262 --> 10:17.030
I'm a ghost
from the revolution.

10:17.098 --> 10:18.531
You're a dog, hello.

10:18.599 --> 10:20.500
Little more street cred here.

10:20.568 --> 10:23.269
Come back.
We're missing something!

10:25.840 --> 10:27.474
Mua-ha-ha-ha!

10:27.541 --> 10:29.976
In-in-infernicus!

10:30.044 --> 10:32.846
That's Lord Infernicus!

10:32.913 --> 10:35.515
Get it right,
sidekick!

10:45.092 --> 10:47.193
We're trapped!

10:47.261 --> 10:48.294
Yahhh!

10:48.362 --> 10:50.163
Time is running out,
sidekicks!

10:50.231 --> 10:53.066
Of course, you could
always give up!

10:57.138 --> 11:00.273
Flaming man gone!

11:00.341 --> 11:03.476
And so is woo-woo-woo,
the Funky Phantom.

11:03.544 --> 11:05.779
What do we do now,
Scooby Doo?

11:05.846 --> 11:07.347
Only thing
we can do--

11:07.414 --> 11:10.984
solve this mystery
before it's too late.

11:11.051 --> 11:13.720
Oooh, this is horrible.
My nerves can't take any more!

11:19.260 --> 11:20.994
Me fix this.

11:23.030 --> 11:25.265
Thanks, I needed that.

11:26.700 --> 11:28.835
Hmm.

11:31.539 --> 11:32.972
Look at this.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.408
Hmm, what's it say?
What's it say?

11:35.476 --> 11:38.011
Me no be able
to read modern ink symbols.

11:38.078 --> 11:41.447
Modern ink symbols
mock Captain Caveman.

11:41.515 --> 11:42.982
I can read.

11:43.050 --> 11:45.485
I help shaggy with
his homework sometimes.

11:47.021 --> 11:48.988
Something
about a ship

11:49.056 --> 11:51.825
leaving from
Crystal Cove docks.

11:51.892 --> 11:53.693
That's outside the school!

11:53.761 --> 11:56.462
We can't leave!

11:57.565 --> 11:59.532
We need to find Angel
and the others.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.801
Lead the way,
Scooby Doo.

12:10.010 --> 12:10.977
Box!

12:11.045 --> 12:12.579
Hey now, baby.

12:12.646 --> 12:14.147
That shouldn't
be there.

12:14.215 --> 12:15.915
Wh--what is it?

12:15.983 --> 12:17.350
Scrambler.

12:21.822 --> 12:23.489
Try your cell phone
now, teach.

12:24.758 --> 12:26.893
It's working!

12:26.961 --> 12:29.062
Not for long!

12:29.129 --> 12:30.630
You were warned.

12:30.698 --> 12:33.800
No communication until
the mystery is solved!

12:33.868 --> 12:37.237
Now you will
pay the price!

12:56.926 --> 12:58.627
Ooh, baby.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.562
That must have been
some party.

13:00.630 --> 13:01.764
Teach?

13:01.831 --> 13:04.500
Oh,
I'm all right.

13:04.567 --> 13:06.168
Oh, thank goodness
Speed Buggy

13:06.236 --> 13:07.503
was there
to help me out.

13:07.570 --> 13:09.671
I owe that
dune buggy my life.

13:09.739 --> 13:11.840
Wait, where is--

13:11.908 --> 13:13.409
Speed Buggy!

13:17.313 --> 13:18.914
He's too heavy
to lift out of there.

13:18.982 --> 13:21.316
There's an emergency
valve on the wall.

13:24.888 --> 13:27.222
He's not breathing!

13:31.161 --> 13:32.761
Oh, we're losing him!

13:32.829 --> 13:33.929
No way, sister.

13:33.997 --> 13:35.297
This dune buggy
ain't gonna die

13:35.365 --> 13:37.900
on Angel Dynamite's
watch. You know CPR?

13:37.967 --> 13:39.068
There's no mouth!

13:39.135 --> 13:41.403
Just blow, woman! Blow!

13:43.840 --> 13:45.908
Sputty.

13:45.975 --> 13:48.177
Aaah!

13:52.949 --> 13:55.784
Oh, plugs!

13:55.852 --> 13:58.787
I did! I gave him...Life!

13:58.855 --> 14:02.257
For the first time,
I feel so alive!

14:02.325 --> 14:04.226
Oh, we have
to drown something

14:04.294 --> 14:06.428
so I can bring it
back to life again!

14:06.496 --> 14:08.831
No time.
Communications are back up.

14:08.898 --> 14:10.032
You still got
that cell phone?

14:10.100 --> 14:11.667
We need to call
the sheriff.

14:11.734 --> 14:14.503
Oh!

14:14.571 --> 14:16.438
Don't worry.
I've confiscated

14:16.506 --> 14:17.873
a ton of these
over the years.

14:17.941 --> 14:19.641
We'll just jet to my office!

14:28.051 --> 14:29.318
Angel?

14:29.385 --> 14:31.487
Principal Quinlan?

14:31.554 --> 14:34.923
Quiet! Uh, I hear something.

14:43.900 --> 14:47.369
Scooby! Dog, we got the
communications tower working.

14:47.437 --> 14:48.971
We found the clue.

14:49.038 --> 14:51.874
Teach, how long till
we get to your office?

14:51.941 --> 14:53.842
Right about...

14:53.910 --> 14:55.744
Now.

15:00.383 --> 15:02.050
Ha ha. Look at that.

15:02.118 --> 15:04.186
It does look like a turkey.

15:05.755 --> 15:07.956
Sheriff Bronson Stone.

15:08.024 --> 15:10.459
Sheriff, this is
Principal Quinlan.

15:10.527 --> 15:12.194
We've got an emergency
at the school.

15:12.262 --> 15:14.096
We need you to get
down to the docks.

15:14.164 --> 15:16.565
Hold on there.
According to my caller id,

15:16.633 --> 15:17.900
this is Amanda Murphy's phone.

15:17.967 --> 15:20.169
Bronson, it's me!

15:20.236 --> 15:21.970
Ha! You kids never quit.

15:22.038 --> 15:23.138
And let me guess--

15:23.206 --> 15:24.640
you want to know
if my refrigerator is running.

15:24.707 --> 15:26.408
Well, I'm no idiot!

15:26.476 --> 15:28.911
Ha! My refrigerator
is right here.

15:28.978 --> 15:32.147
That'll teach 'em.

15:32.215 --> 15:35.250
Oh. Looks like
we're on our own.

15:37.086 --> 15:40.722
There it is,
the Crystal Cove docks.

15:46.629 --> 15:48.697
Look!

15:53.203 --> 15:54.303
He's getting away!

15:54.370 --> 15:56.538
Don't worry!
Now we're in my territory!

15:57.674 --> 15:59.007
Me help, too!

15:59.075 --> 16:00.909
Ride shark like pony.

16:00.977 --> 16:03.979
Hurt skull man
who took teen angels!

16:04.047 --> 16:06.381
Yoo-hoo!

16:11.921 --> 16:14.256
Huh?

16:14.324 --> 16:17.793
Get away from my ship,
you pathetic mackerel!

16:20.630 --> 16:22.531
He's getting away!

16:22.599 --> 16:27.736
Not for long!
Captain Caveman!

16:32.709 --> 16:35.844
No! No, no, no!

16:38.681 --> 16:40.415
Yeah!

16:53.863 --> 16:55.564
Huh?

16:55.632 --> 17:00.035
Yo, hot head!
Pull it over! It's a wrap!

17:00.103 --> 17:03.338
I have to admit,
I admire your persistence.

17:03.406 --> 17:05.406
Oh, wait--no, I don't!

17:18.186 --> 17:20.521
Raggy!

17:20.589 --> 17:22.124
Scooby Doo!

17:22.191 --> 17:23.925
Where'd I go?!

17:23.992 --> 17:25.060
I was right.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.662
These guinea pigs
are just--

17:26.729 --> 17:27.996
Guinea pigs.
Scooby,

17:28.064 --> 17:29.231
you're a genius.

17:29.299 --> 17:31.333
Speed Buggy,
pull in front of the truck.

17:31.401 --> 17:32.734
I've got a plan.

17:38.841 --> 17:40.842
Piggies away!

17:44.480 --> 17:46.248
What?! No!

17:53.723 --> 17:55.123
Aah!

17:57.460 --> 18:00.295
Ohh, a wise-guy, ehh?

18:00.363 --> 18:02.597
Aahh!

18:14.110 --> 18:15.844
Thanks, Angel,
Principal Quinlan.

18:15.912 --> 18:17.479
It was starting
to get ripe in there.

18:17.547 --> 18:20.215
Although it was
a pretty well constructed box.

18:20.283 --> 18:23.085
Don't thank us,
baby. Thank them.

18:25.121 --> 18:27.255
Look at that.
For the time ever,

18:27.323 --> 18:29.458
the sidekicks have
solved the mystery.

18:29.525 --> 18:34.896
Now, let's see exactly
who Lord Infernicus is.

18:34.964 --> 18:36.798
The Funky Phantom?!

18:36.866 --> 18:39.067
It's me,
don't you know.

18:39.135 --> 18:40.602
But why?

18:40.670 --> 18:42.637
I was sick of being
a sidekick.

18:42.705 --> 18:44.139
Resentful, even.

18:44.207 --> 18:45.807
I'm not a real ghost.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.676
I'm Jonathan
Wellington Muddlemore--

18:47.744 --> 18:51.980
actor, thespian,
dramatator.

18:52.048 --> 18:53.949
I was behind
in my rent at the Y,

18:54.016 --> 18:57.819
so a friend told me about
this clock I could squat in.

18:57.887 --> 19:00.255
When they found me
and thought I was a ghost,

19:00.323 --> 19:01.590
I figured why not.

19:01.657 --> 19:04.059
Ghost gig got me
3 hots and a cot,

19:04.127 --> 19:06.695
but I got tired of taking
a back seat, don't you know.

19:06.763 --> 19:09.164
I wanted to headline.
I wanted to be the boss.

19:09.232 --> 19:10.432
In charge, even.

19:10.500 --> 19:12.100
With my own sidekicks.

19:12.168 --> 19:15.270
That's when I stumbled upon
the mystery solvers state finals.

19:15.338 --> 19:17.873
I had workshopped
my Lord Infernicus character

19:17.940 --> 19:20.675
at various comedy clubs and
state fairs around the country.

19:20.743 --> 19:22.110
And it has always
been a hit.

19:23.513 --> 19:25.881
It was a simple matter
to use mirrors

19:25.948 --> 19:29.217
and a video projector
to make myself appear and fly.

19:29.285 --> 19:31.119
A little smoke,
fireworks,

19:31.187 --> 19:34.222
a skeleton puppet identical
to my own bone structure

19:34.290 --> 19:35.824
for close-up work,
a pre-recorded voice,

19:35.892 --> 19:38.059
and the deed was done.

19:38.127 --> 19:40.996
I even abducted
my own cat Boo.

19:41.063 --> 19:44.232
The plan was to ship
everyone off to Africa,

19:44.300 --> 19:45.400
where there is
a desperate need

19:45.468 --> 19:47.035
for teenage
mystery solvers.

19:47.103 --> 19:49.638
I then created the ruse
with the guinea pigs;

19:49.705 --> 19:52.574
sewing each of their
tiny costumes by hand,

19:52.642 --> 19:55.944
using the actual vintage fabrics
of their real life counterparts

19:56.012 --> 19:57.479
just to throw you
off track.

19:57.547 --> 20:01.049
It was perfect.
Genius, even.

20:01.117 --> 20:04.619
Until your ridiculous dog
started acting like a hero

20:04.687 --> 20:05.854
instead of a sidekick.

20:05.922 --> 20:07.656
Ohhh!

20:07.723 --> 20:10.125
You lied to me.

20:10.193 --> 20:11.526
Meow!

20:13.596 --> 20:15.297
Like, Scoob,

20:15.364 --> 20:18.400
looks like you and your pals
are the heroes of this mystery.

20:18.468 --> 20:20.368
Let's hear it
for the sidekicks.

20:20.436 --> 20:21.436
Hip hip--

20:21.504 --> 20:24.206
hooray! Hip hip hooray!

20:24.273 --> 20:25.874
Hip hip hooray!

20:25.942 --> 20:28.243
Huh?

20:28.311 --> 20:29.778
Scooby?
Are you ok?

20:29.846 --> 20:31.847
Oh, he doesn't
look so good, gang.

20:31.914 --> 20:34.316
What happened?
I don't feel...

20:34.383 --> 20:36.451
So well...

20:36.519 --> 20:38.487
Shaggy!

20:38.554 --> 20:40.155
Scoob! Scooby Doo!

20:40.223 --> 20:42.357
Calm down. I'm right here.

20:42.425 --> 20:44.326
We're all right here.

20:44.393 --> 20:45.927
What happened?

20:45.995 --> 20:47.329
You had a fever.

20:47.396 --> 20:49.564
You've been
delirious for days.

20:49.632 --> 20:53.101
Days? But the mystery
solvers finals!

20:53.169 --> 20:55.871
Oh, we blew that off.
You know we'd never go without you.

20:55.938 --> 20:58.139
Excuse me for a second.

21:02.411 --> 21:04.346
Why!

21:04.413 --> 21:05.780
I still can't believe it!

21:05.848 --> 21:08.049
Why, why, why?!

21:08.117 --> 21:10.118
But I was there!

21:10.186 --> 21:13.655
There was shark,
a cave man, and a dune buggy!

21:13.723 --> 21:16.458
Dude! You mean
like these?

21:17.960 --> 21:19.828
It was a dream?

21:19.896 --> 21:21.763
I guess I was afraid
you'd go without me

21:21.831 --> 21:25.133
because you didn't need
a sidekick.

21:25.201 --> 21:26.401
No way!

21:26.469 --> 21:27.702
You're not
a sidekick.

21:27.770 --> 21:29.137
You're
a team member.

21:29.205 --> 21:30.739
And besides,
they moved the date

21:30.806 --> 21:31.740
just so
you could go!

21:31.807 --> 21:33.942
We haven't
told Fred yet.

21:34.010 --> 21:37.112
Yeah. The chairman himself
came to see how you were doing.

21:37.179 --> 21:38.346
Hello!

21:38.414 --> 21:40.181
How you doing?
Good to see you.

21:40.249 --> 21:42.117
A pleasure, even!

21:42.184 --> 21:44.519
Aahh! It's him!

21:44.587 --> 21:46.655
Funky Phantom!
Funky Phantom!

21:46.722 --> 21:48.790
Heavens to Delaware!

21:48.858 --> 21:50.792
Was it something I said?!
