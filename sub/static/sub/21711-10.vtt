01:01.520 --> 01:03.064
Hey!

01:06.025 --> 01:10.112
Hey, ladies.
Are you looking for something?

01:10.613 --> 01:13.491
We're just taking a ride.
Can't we pass?

01:13.949 --> 01:16.118
No, sweetheart. You have to go back.

01:24.627 --> 01:28.339
Listen... Do you want to hang out
later back in town?

01:28.464 --> 01:30.800
- What?
- I said...

02:08.337 --> 02:09.880
No, no, no!

02:37.366 --> 02:39.869
- Julio.
- Pacho, you motherfucker.

02:39.994 --> 02:41.620
Motherfucking dog!

02:47.126 --> 02:49.253
Let me go!

02:53.632 --> 02:56.302
Let go of me!

02:57.261 --> 03:00.181
Let me go! Let go...

03:01.682 --> 03:02.892
You.

03:05.019 --> 03:06.562
Mrs. Salazar.

03:08.898 --> 03:11.317
Do you know
what makes me happy, Pacho?

03:11.442 --> 03:13.402
Makes me very happy?

03:13.527 --> 03:17.823
That my sons didn't kill
your brother Alvaro.

03:17.948 --> 03:23.495
Because he's going to live
the rest of his life as half a man.

03:23.621 --> 03:25.706
Half man, half...

03:51.398 --> 03:52.983
Help!

03:54.818 --> 03:56.320
Help!

06:22.800 --> 06:24.843
'The great event
of the surrender

06:24.968 --> 06:28.597
'of Helmer Herrera to Colombian justice.

06:28.722 --> 06:34.395

Leave that there.

07:36.832 --> 07:39.668
Gilberto. How've you been?

07:39.793 --> 07:43.589
Good, brother.
Grateful that we're all together.

07:43.714 --> 07:47.176
The investment we made in our friends
can bear fruit.

07:47.301 --> 07:48.927
And then, all this will pass away

07:49.052 --> 07:51.847
like some old joke
you can't quite remember.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.975
For this, gentlemen,
I propose a toast.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.768
Of course you would.

07:56.894 --> 07:58.479
Fucking Chepe.

07:59.229 --> 08:02.065
Gilberto, I'd like to say a few words.

08:03.025 --> 08:06.028
You all know this wasn't what I wanted.

08:06.153 --> 08:11.992
So it's very hard for me to admit
that I know this is for the best.

08:12.117 --> 08:15.245
And thanks to you, we're on
the verge of... How do you call it?

08:15.370 --> 08:17.372
"A great victory."

08:21.043 --> 08:22.961
We believe in you.

08:23.879 --> 08:27.007
To my brother, Gilberto.
Our leader.

08:27.132 --> 08:29.384
Gentlemen of Cali<i>... salud!</i>

08:29.510 --> 08:31.178
Cheers!

08:55.786 --> 08:57.120
Don't worry about it.

09:04.002 --> 09:05.379
Agent Peña.

09:07.172 --> 09:08.674
Hello.

09:08.799 --> 09:11.218
- Can we talk?
- Yeah. Give me a second.

09:11.343 --> 09:13.095
Go with your mum.

09:13.887 --> 09:17.099
I checked with the embassy. They're
finishing up paperwork this afternoon.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.142
You're on a flight tomorrow. First thing.

09:22.271 --> 09:23.855
Guillermo Pallomari...

09:25.399 --> 09:28.569
- Any idea where we can find him?
- No. Why do you need him?

09:28.694 --> 09:31.196
Gilberto and Miguel Rodríguez
gave six million dollars

09:31.321 --> 09:33.365
to Samper's presidential campaign.

09:34.533 --> 09:37.578
So unless we get Pallomari in the States
testifying on the cartel,

09:37.703 --> 09:39.413
generating new indictments...

09:40.998 --> 09:44.918
- What are you telling me?
- The godfathers won't stay locked up.

09:48.297 --> 09:52.259
What'll happen to my family if these men
keep all their money and all their power?

09:52.384 --> 09:55.679
Witness Protection Services will provide
security for as long as you need.

10:03.604 --> 10:05.814
Pallomari's wife's having an affair.

10:05.939 --> 10:09.026
- With who?
- Some guy at her office. Fredy Moya.

10:09.151 --> 10:11.778
The phones in the cartel safe house,
they're tapped.

10:11.903 --> 10:14.990
I overheard a conversation between them.
It didn't sound like business.

10:19.494 --> 10:24.458
- And he can keep them in prison?
- We find Pallomari or the godfathers walk.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.463
You're not gonna find him without me.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.550
You're right.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.265
Go ahead, sir.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.184
Director.

10:42.309 --> 10:45.312
Don Miguel.
Please, go ahead.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.696
♪ To all the killers
and a hundred dollar billers... ♪

10:57.616 --> 10:59.159
- Hello.
- 'It's me.

10:59.660 --> 11:02.371
- Where are we on Pallomari?
- 'We put Navegante on it, Dad.'

11:02.496 --> 11:04.456
I'll find him, don't worry about it.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.750
And fucking Salcedo too, you'll see.

11:06.875 --> 11:09.378
David, don't take your eye off Henao.

11:10.212 --> 11:14.841
That motherfucker might see this
as an opportunity. Keep a low profile.

11:16.677 --> 11:19.137
Sure, don't worry.

11:20.639 --> 11:23.266
- How's María?
- 'I really don't know.'

11:23.392 --> 11:27.145
'How come you don't know?
Make sure she's taken care of.'

11:27.270 --> 11:29.398
It's very important
that you handle Pallomari.

11:29.523 --> 11:34.528
That motherfucker could ruin everything.
Call me when it's done.

11:51.670 --> 11:54.089
- Guillermo?
- I need your help, Gonzalo.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.633
You know I can't get involved.

11:56.758 --> 12:00.137
Nothing is going to happen to you.
When has anything ever happened to you?

12:00.262 --> 12:02.222
I'm asking you for legal advice,
and quickly.

12:03.807 --> 12:07.436
I've decided that the best way
to get out of this situation

12:07.561 --> 12:09.646
is to turn myself in to the authorities.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.732
Yes, normally that would be
the case. Yes.

12:11.857 --> 12:15.068
But the problem is you already
have a warrant out for your arrest.

12:15.193 --> 12:16.695
An arrest warrant?

12:16.820 --> 12:20.198
The police won't protect you.
In fact, they'll probably kill you.

12:20.949 --> 12:23.326
I'm the head accountant.

12:23.452 --> 12:25.579
And every dollar in this organisation,
and every secret,

12:25.704 --> 12:27.622
has been through this head.
It's all in here.

12:27.748 --> 12:29.708
So tell whoever needs to know
that I'm willing to negotiate.

12:31.585 --> 12:34.755
Guillermo, my advice to you
is to get your family and leave Cali.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.799
My wife's very attached to her work.

12:37.924 --> 12:41.344
- What? I don't understand.
- You know her, she's stubborn.

12:42.304 --> 12:45.307
She built her business
from the ground up.

12:49.853 --> 12:51.480
I can't leave without her.

12:52.314 --> 12:57.360
Look, Guillermo... this is not
my legal advice, but as your friend.

12:57.486 --> 13:02.157
Talk some sense into your wife.
Immediately.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.497
Can you get me a gun?

13:12.209 --> 13:14.336
We'll have to look out for ourselves
for the rest of our lives,

13:14.461 --> 13:19.090
but if I help them, maybe one day
we can come back to Colombia.

13:19.216 --> 13:21.927
Are you insane? They almost killed us.

13:23.011 --> 13:26.890
They almost killed us, and now you're
telling me you want to go back? To Cali?

13:27.015 --> 13:29.309
Do you really think
we can come back to Colombia?

13:29.434 --> 13:33.855
The moment we come back to Colombia,
they'll kill our daughters.

13:33.980 --> 13:37.609
Are you doing this to make up
for the last four years of your life?

13:42.823 --> 13:44.658
I'm a good man.

13:50.080 --> 13:52.082
I was a good man.

13:52.207 --> 13:56.086
I'll leave with the girls tomorrow.
I'm not waiting for you.

14:08.557 --> 14:10.934
Wait for me, okay? Thanks.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.616
That way.

14:33.206 --> 14:37.043
Keep looking for him.
No more fucking excuses.

14:38.461 --> 14:39.796
Okay.

14:46.553 --> 14:47.846
Yeah?

14:49.890 --> 14:52.434
Have you heard from your father?

14:53.476 --> 14:54.603
Yes.

14:58.815 --> 15:02.694
David, I've been wondering about
the arrangement I had for my son and...

15:02.819 --> 15:04.070
Arrangement?

15:06.072 --> 15:07.741
I thought it was true love.

15:10.327 --> 15:12.913
Your father knows I care about him.

15:15.874 --> 15:18.335
That's beautiful. Seriously.

15:19.169 --> 15:21.004
But here's the thing...

15:22.213 --> 15:24.215
You don't mean anything to me.

15:24.925 --> 15:26.885
You're not my mother.

15:27.010 --> 15:29.429
You're not my fucking problem.

15:30.013 --> 15:31.556
- David...
- What?

15:32.432 --> 15:34.809
What the fuck do I owe you?

15:40.065 --> 15:41.399
María...

15:41.524 --> 15:45.612
Open your legs for someone else.
You're good at that.

15:48.073 --> 15:49.449
Okay?

16:03.630 --> 16:08.176
Once we step off this plane,
whatever goes down is on me.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.262
We are way off the well-lit path.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.143
Jorge...

17:41.603 --> 17:43.271
Good afternoon, Mr. Salcedo.

17:43.396 --> 17:47.275
Mr. Espinosa's still at lunch.
He should be back soon.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.694
- We'll wait for him inside.
- Okay, sir.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.240
Another drink?

17:56.284 --> 17:58.828
I need to go. See you next week.

18:10.048 --> 18:12.967
Excuse me.
How are the girls here?

18:13.093 --> 18:14.719
The best of Cali.

18:15.970 --> 18:17.097
Open it!

18:19.849 --> 18:21.267
Get in.

18:22.560 --> 18:25.021
Get in, motherfucker!

18:31.736 --> 18:33.029
Okay...

18:35.698 --> 18:38.118
ACCESS RESTRICTED
PASSWORD REQUIRED

18:42.664 --> 18:44.541
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

18:44.666 --> 18:47.335
- I'm looking for Fredy Moya.
- Yes.

18:47.460 --> 18:50.004
- The one wearing purple.
- Thanks.

18:52.507 --> 18:55.635
Don't pull my chain.
I'm looking at the numbers.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.888
Excuse me.
You work with Patricia Pallomari?

19:01.307 --> 19:03.393
Javier Peña, DEA.

19:04.352 --> 19:05.895
I'll call you back.

19:07.438 --> 19:10.525
I'm afraid Patricia has
taken a temporary leave of absence.

19:10.650 --> 19:11.985
That so?

19:13.361 --> 19:16.781
- You have any idea where I can find her?
- I wouldn't know.

19:17.574 --> 19:20.910
- She in trouble?
- No, but her husband is.

19:21.035 --> 19:25.373
There's a warrant out for his arrest
and a pretty substantial reward.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.458
Any information is helpful.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.832
- 'Hello?'
- It's me.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.294
Baby, I can't talk right now.
Call me back later.

20:11.419 --> 20:14.255
'No. Wait, I can't call you back.
Wait.'

20:14.380 --> 20:15.632
Yes.

20:16.633 --> 20:20.803
Yes, I'd have to check
my records in the office.

20:22.013 --> 20:24.891
I can't talk. Wait...

20:25.016 --> 20:29.854
Patricia, the DEA was just here.
The DEA. Asking questions.

20:29.979 --> 20:32.357
- 'What did you tell them?'
- 'To go fuck themselves.

20:32.482 --> 20:36.110
- 'They want Guillermo, not you.'
- 'I can't talk now. We'll discuss it later.'

20:36.236 --> 20:39.364
- That's her.
- 'Patricia, they talked about a reward.'

20:42.533 --> 20:44.661
So, she used the line

20:44.786 --> 20:47.956
in an apartment
in the north part of the city.

20:48.081 --> 20:50.208
We need to take advantage.

20:51.251 --> 20:54.003
I need to use the bathroom.

21:11.145 --> 21:13.731
- Work again?
- Yes.

21:13.856 --> 21:15.275
Excuse me.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.026
Excuse me.

21:17.151 --> 21:19.153
Open the window this time.

21:42.552 --> 21:43.553
This way.

21:57.066 --> 22:03.614
I'd offer a drink,
but I don't pour liquor for Cali whores.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.454
Have a seat.

22:16.669 --> 22:20.423
Don Orlando,
I'm here to ask for your protection.

22:21.758 --> 22:25.470
Why? You don't feel safe?

22:30.475 --> 22:33.853
I did what I had to do
after my husband died.

22:33.978 --> 22:39.067
Now I'm in your home...
ready to do what I have to do once again.

22:44.614 --> 22:46.824
So what is it you're offering me?

22:55.416 --> 22:58.336
In here.
How was the drive?

22:58.461 --> 23:00.546
It was easy.

23:00.671 --> 23:02.048
Nice place.

23:14.811 --> 23:16.938
Let me start by thanking you
for the meeting.

23:17.063 --> 23:20.233
We're both busy men.
I won't waste your time.

23:20.775 --> 23:23.569
But I'm a businessman, like you.

23:24.362 --> 23:30.326
The information you seek maybe,
maybe, maybe is in my possession.

23:32.662 --> 23:35.832
If we come to an arrangement,
my information becomes yours.

23:35.957 --> 23:37.917
You feel me?

23:39.961 --> 23:45.133
On the phone, you told me
you know where Pallomari is. Correct?

23:47.927 --> 23:50.054
Look, let me put it this way...

23:52.682 --> 23:55.059
Patricia and I are in love.

23:55.184 --> 23:57.478
We want to be together.

24:00.064 --> 24:02.442
So Guillermo's a problem for me.

24:04.026 --> 24:09.532
And from what I've heard,
he's a problem for you too. Am I right?

24:10.783 --> 24:12.618
You are correct.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.333
So maybe we can help each other.

24:19.459 --> 24:23.129
If we come to an arrangement,
my information becomes yours.

24:28.926 --> 24:30.344
Okay.

24:32.680 --> 24:33.931
Okay.

24:34.849 --> 24:37.852
- Let me fix you a drink. Okay?
- Sure.

24:39.687 --> 24:42.773
By the way, are you guys
running Windows 95 yet?

24:42.899 --> 24:45.193
Think we're going to wait for next year.

24:46.611 --> 24:48.905
Where the fuck is Pallomari,
you queer?

24:49.030 --> 24:50.740
Did you hear me?

25:05.046 --> 25:08.466
Here's the milk. Just a few minutes
and then you go to bed.

25:13.804 --> 25:16.974
- Get in your room.
- Who is it? Who is it?

25:17.099 --> 25:19.018
I don't know.
Get in your room. Quickly.

25:25.441 --> 25:27.818
- Drop the gun! Put it down!
- Drop your weapon! Put it down!

25:27.944 --> 25:29.904
- It's okay.
- They're the gringos.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.656
- Calm down.
- Do you know them?

25:31.781 --> 25:33.824
- They came to my office.
- Put the gun down.

25:33.950 --> 25:36.994
- Close the door.
- We're here to help you.

25:37.828 --> 25:39.413
Close the door.

25:39.539 --> 25:41.457
- Okay.
- Okay.

25:43.167 --> 25:45.461
Lower your gun.
You understand?

25:48.297 --> 25:51.050
- I'd put the safety on.
- Sorry.

25:52.134 --> 25:53.970
Do you want to sit?

26:14.240 --> 26:18.619
Okay, DEA, are we speaking English
or Spanish or...? I don't give a shit.

26:18.744 --> 26:20.663
The Colombians have a warrant
for your arrest.

26:20.788 --> 26:22.790
- I know.
- And the cartel wants you dead.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.792
I'm well aware of that.

26:27.670 --> 26:32.925
The only way you survive this
is if we get you out to the United States.

26:33.050 --> 26:34.468
Guillermo...

26:35.928 --> 26:38.931
- The United States?
- We have your ledger.

26:43.519 --> 26:47.690
You decode it for us
and you testify on what you know...

26:47.815 --> 26:49.317
That's quite a bit.

26:49.442 --> 26:52.111
...and we make sure that
you and your family are safe.

26:55.448 --> 26:58.951
- Which place in the United States?
- I'm not sure. We have a program that...

26:59.076 --> 27:03.164
Yeah, I know. The program.
But if I'm giving up my life...

27:05.416 --> 27:08.169
...I want to know
what I'm getting for it.

27:08.294 --> 27:11.255
For instance,
which kind of house will we have?

27:12.423 --> 27:14.884
My family requires
a certain amount of square footage.

27:15.009 --> 27:17.511
It wasn't very hard for us to find you
and it won't be hard for them.

27:17.637 --> 27:19.263
Do you understand that?

27:19.388 --> 27:23.934
This is your chance
to keep your family alive.

27:26.437 --> 27:28.272
We will negotiate the details later.

27:28.397 --> 27:31.901
This is the only option you have.
Do you understand that?

27:35.029 --> 27:36.364
- Yeah.
- Okay.

27:36.489 --> 27:38.699
Why don't you pack your things,
as little as possible.

27:38.824 --> 27:41.577
No, Guillermo.
We can't leave for at least a week.

27:41.702 --> 27:44.789
- You heard them.
- The company. I can't just leave!

27:44.914 --> 27:47.458
- I need at least a week...
- Okay!

27:54.256 --> 27:59.095
Put the radio on the dash
and your hands on the wheel.

28:18.614 --> 28:20.866
How are you, Jorge Salcedo?

28:26.455 --> 28:30.042
Go help your kids pack
and let me talk to your wife.

28:30.167 --> 28:31.961
Yeah.

28:37.258 --> 28:40.469
I know about Fredy Moya.
It's none of my business.

28:40.594 --> 28:44.265
- You're right. It's not your problem.
- You realise what happens if they find you?

28:45.808 --> 28:47.643
And your kids?

28:52.857 --> 28:56.902
I have to say goodbye to him.
We're in love. I can't leave like that.

28:57.027 --> 29:00.239
Mrs. Pallomari, if you stay, you die.

29:01.490 --> 29:02.700
Understood?

29:03.784 --> 29:05.745
I'll be honest with you.

29:06.454 --> 29:08.497
The truth is...

29:08.622 --> 29:12.710
I was very disappointed
to hear you were the fucking rat.

29:15.921 --> 29:18.007
But I still like you.

29:20.509 --> 29:24.638
It's all good. I'm not going to kill you.

29:27.224 --> 29:28.851
David Rodríguez...

29:30.853 --> 29:33.856
...he wants to do it himself
personally, you know?

29:35.065 --> 29:36.776
That's fine by me.

29:38.235 --> 29:41.655
That way,
our friendship will remain intact.

29:55.044 --> 29:56.295
- Let's go.
- Come on, damn it!

29:57.213 --> 29:59.381
- The jacket...
- Okay, that's it. Let's go.

29:59.507 --> 30:00.925
We're on our way down.

30:21.654 --> 30:24.198
'Salcedo, we're in the lobby now.'

30:24.323 --> 30:26.242
Are we clear?

30:27.993 --> 30:29.411
'Salcedo?'

30:30.746 --> 30:32.748
Tell them to come out.

30:37.086 --> 30:38.546
Jorge, we clear or not?

30:40.965 --> 30:43.551
Tell them to come out, Jorge Salcedo.

30:47.847 --> 30:49.515
All clear.

30:52.226 --> 30:53.686
Copy.

30:53.811 --> 30:55.688
All right, stay close.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.123
Let's finish this.

31:19.420 --> 31:20.880
Put the gun down.

31:23.591 --> 31:25.426
I don't want to kill you.

31:28.762 --> 31:30.764
We both know that's a lie.

31:35.895 --> 31:39.106
Get down! Get behind the car!
Over there!

31:51.911 --> 31:54.163
What the fuck happened?

31:55.205 --> 31:57.374
He has the keys.

31:57.499 --> 31:59.835
- Let's move!
- Come on, get in the car!

31:59.960 --> 32:01.629
Let's go!

32:01.754 --> 32:02.922
- You drive.
- Patricia!

32:03.047 --> 32:06.967
Don't look!
Don't look! Don't look! Don't look!

32:09.136 --> 32:12.765
- Don't look at that!
- What the fuck is he doing here?

32:12.890 --> 32:15.643
He saved your life!
Get in the fucking car!

32:15.768 --> 32:17.436
Open! Open!

32:18.270 --> 32:21.649
Be careful, be careful. Okay.

32:21.774 --> 32:23.233
Move, move, move, move!

32:36.538 --> 32:38.707
What happened? Huh?

32:39.792 --> 32:41.335
They killed Navegante.

32:43.629 --> 32:46.966
- And Pallomari?
- The motherfucker's gone.

32:48.050 --> 32:49.468
You sure?

32:53.931 --> 32:56.600
We're going to the airport.
We're going to catch those...

32:56.725 --> 32:59.812
We're leaving, now!
Motherfuckers!

33:04.566 --> 33:06.402
You, come with me.

33:08.112 --> 33:11.865
We're going to the airport.
Take the guys. Now, now, now!

33:19.790 --> 33:24.461
That's the North Valley, you fuckers.
Who do they think they're messing with?

33:24.586 --> 33:26.714
You just got smoked, bitches.

33:34.596 --> 33:35.806
Boss!

33:37.307 --> 33:38.517
Boss!

33:52.865 --> 33:54.867
Let's go. Out.

33:55.701 --> 33:58.078
- Could you open, please?
- Yes. There you go.

33:58.203 --> 33:59.455
Thank you.

33:59.580 --> 34:03.208
Patricia, get out this way.
Careful, my love.

34:03.333 --> 34:04.626
Okay.

34:05.711 --> 34:09.131
- What's this?
- You're wanted by the CNP.

34:09.256 --> 34:12.843
We can't aid the escape of a fugitive,
so you've gotta fly yourself out.

34:13.761 --> 34:16.055
Do you see that?
We have a private plane.

34:16.180 --> 34:18.390
We have a plane just for us.

34:18.515 --> 34:22.770
- If you could sign here, sir?
- Me? Okay. Yeah.

34:23.479 --> 34:26.607
You have to pay for the plane.
Whatever you have on you.

34:27.775 --> 34:29.860
I don't carry that kind of cash...

34:29.985 --> 34:33.822
It's just a technicality.
So that it's not kidnapping.

34:33.947 --> 34:36.784
Just a moment.
If it's just a technicality...

34:38.702 --> 34:41.997
- Thanks. Okay.
- Okay.

34:42.122 --> 34:44.917
Get on the plane. Go.
Everything's going to be fine.

34:45.042 --> 34:47.377
Come on. Let's go.

34:52.382 --> 34:53.842
Goodbye, Salcedo.

35:24.039 --> 35:28.168
Ladies and gentlemen, my next witness
has direct, first-hand knowledge

35:28.293 --> 35:32.798
of the criminal activities uncovered
by Operation Cornerstone.

35:32.923 --> 35:34.675
Please state your name, sir.

35:35.717 --> 35:37.302
Guillermo Pallomari.

35:37.427 --> 35:39.638
And you were an accountant
for the Cali cartel?

35:39.763 --> 35:43.142
No, I was the chief accountant.
The chief<i>. El jefe.</i>

35:43.267 --> 35:45.811
'Guillermo Pallomari
had a lot to say.

35:45.936 --> 35:48.897
'And he said it in federal courtrooms
from Miami to New York City.'

35:49.022 --> 35:52.359
This is the ledger of Mr. Pallomaro
that only he himself can interpret.

35:52.484 --> 35:56.655
I'm sorry, your Honour, my English is not
quite good, but his Spanish is awful.

35:56.780 --> 35:59.199
Can you repeat my name?
"Pallomari." It's so simple.

35:59.324 --> 36:01.869
'And people were interested
in what he had to say,

36:01.994 --> 36:05.205
'especially about the cartel's influence
with the Colombian government.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.332
'So that government
went on the defensive.'

36:07.457 --> 36:10.711
'And we have total
agreement in that these testimonies

36:10.836 --> 36:16.175
'that we have heard from Mr. Pallomari
are ridiculous and grotesquely false.

36:16.300 --> 36:17.551
'Thank you very much.'

36:17.676 --> 36:19.469
'But the damage was done.

36:19.595 --> 36:22.973
'It would be most helpful if the Colombian
president, who's head of the government,

36:23.098 --> 36:25.225
'was as dedicated
to fighting narcotics trafficking

36:25.350 --> 36:27.269
'as many of the people
in his own government.'

36:27.394 --> 36:30.731
'The U.S. House and Senate
began making noise about decertification,

36:30.856 --> 36:35.068
'turning Colombia from an ally
in The War on Drugs into an enemy,

36:35.194 --> 36:37.112
'threatening to choke off
the vital foreign aid

36:37.237 --> 36:40.532
'that served the shadowy interests
of both nations.

36:40.657 --> 36:42.326
'And that scared people.

36:42.451 --> 36:47.456
'Enough to see justice finally done?
Well, governments don't work that way.'

36:47.581 --> 36:49.374
You know how many times
I've gotten a call

36:49.499 --> 36:52.085
from the Department of Justice and State
the same morning?

36:53.921 --> 36:58.300
Count 'em on one finger.
Guess we have you to thank for that.

36:59.134 --> 37:01.345
I'm headed over
to the National Palace right now,

37:01.470 --> 37:07.142
to make clear to President Samper himself
that the godfathers stay in jail.

37:07.267 --> 37:11.271
- At least for the foreseeable future.
- But that's as far as it goes?

37:15.150 --> 37:18.862
We drew up a draft indictment outlining
President Samper's ties to the Cali cartel.

37:18.987 --> 37:20.656
Alleged ties.

37:21.865 --> 37:24.743
And I suggest you keep that draft
to yourself.

37:24.868 --> 37:28.455
The DOJ's not going to topple
a government, Agent Peña.

37:31.500 --> 37:34.336
You can't tell me
you're surprised by that.

37:35.671 --> 37:39.383
Some part of me
was holding out hope, I guess.

37:41.093 --> 37:44.304
Well, you should tell that part
to grow the fuck up.

37:44.429 --> 37:47.766
No, I mean it, Agent Peña.
You should be happy.

37:47.891 --> 37:49.977
You played the system
like a goddamn fiddle.

37:53.105 --> 37:55.816
You won.

38:03.824 --> 38:05.450
Yes, sir.

38:16.169 --> 38:18.171
'Another deal.

38:19.673 --> 38:21.675
'A compromise.

38:23.427 --> 38:25.429
'A charade.

38:27.347 --> 38:29.141
'A way for governments
who don't give a shit

38:29.266 --> 38:31.560
'about the war
they're supposed to be fighting...

38:33.145 --> 38:35.689
'to go on pretending they're winning it.

38:36.732 --> 38:38.734
'But it can't be won.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.362
'It'll never be won.

38:44.072 --> 38:46.992
'At least not until people see it
for what it is.

38:50.037 --> 38:52.164
'Not until they know the truth.'

39:19.816 --> 39:23.653
You know what it means
if you go on the record, right?

39:24.571 --> 39:26.865
There'll be a price to pay.

39:28.658 --> 39:30.494
Press the button.

39:34.706 --> 39:37.542
Let's start with your name
and occupation.

39:42.172 --> 39:46.843
Javier Peña,
DEA attaché in Colombia.

39:50.430 --> 39:52.516
'And so the truth got out.

39:52.641 --> 39:57.145
'The news that the Cali cartel had
donated to the president's campaign

39:57.270 --> 40:00.524
'in exchange for virtual immunity

40:00.649 --> 40:03.360
'turned Colombia upside down.

40:03.485 --> 40:08.490
'And when the highest-ranking DEA agent
in the country went on the record

40:08.615 --> 40:11.618
'and said not only did
the United States know about it,

40:11.743 --> 40:14.621
'but we allowed it to happen,

40:14.746 --> 40:16.665
'they couldn't hide from it anymore.'

40:16.790 --> 40:18.625
'In an exclusive interview,

40:18.750 --> 40:21.878
'he accuses the country
of being a Narco-Democracy.

40:22.003 --> 40:24.339
'He said the country
has fallen into the abyss.

40:24.464 --> 40:28.051
'His words have not been well received
by the Colombian people.

40:28.176 --> 40:31.680
'The public is demanding
an official response...'

40:42.190 --> 40:46.445
You didn't really call the country that
we're guests in a "Narco-Democracy"?

40:46.570 --> 40:48.780
- Are you saying it isn't?
- The State Department's livid.

40:48.905 --> 40:52.451
Good.
They're responsible. We all are.

40:53.618 --> 40:56.580
Samper is not going anywhere.

40:56.705 --> 41:00.208
Well, at least people know the truth.

41:06.840 --> 41:10.343
I want you gone, Peña.
So do the Colombians.

41:10.469 --> 41:12.304
I understand, sir.

41:19.686 --> 41:24.524
You know, any aspirations you had
for your career...

41:26.193 --> 41:29.112
...just got dragged
behind the barn and shot.

41:33.450 --> 41:36.411
I resigned from the DEA this morning.

41:48.965 --> 41:53.303
'Recordings that link the president
with narcotrafficking have been leaked.'

41:53.428 --> 41:55.430
'The reality is that
they need five million.

41:55.555 --> 41:57.974
- 'Uh-huh.'
- 'We're missing three, see?'

41:58.099 --> 41:59.809
- 'We have it.'
- 'Yes?'

41:59.935 --> 42:01.394
'Yes, that's done.'

42:01.520 --> 42:04.523
'This scandal threatens elected president
Ernesto Samper's career

42:04.648 --> 42:08.360
'if the authorities confirm his campaign
was funded by narcotrafficking money.'

42:08.485 --> 42:12.322
'President Samper,
the only solution is your resignation!'

42:12.447 --> 42:16.409
'Colombians can be certain...

42:19.829 --> 42:25.835
'...that if they prove
any money transfer of any kind,

42:25.961 --> 42:30.757
'the deposit would've been made
behind my back.'

42:31.925 --> 42:36.346
'The Colombians called
the scandal "Proceso 8000".

42:37.681 --> 42:40.517
'And it set into motion
a series of events

42:40.642 --> 42:44.437
'that finally brought the reign
of the Cali godfathers to an end.

42:46.356 --> 42:50.318
'Chepe Santacruz never did make it
back to New York.

'Without the government's guarantee

42:55.991 --> 43:00.370
'Chepe decided that prison wasn't
the best place for him to be.

43:01.079 --> 43:03.957
'And so, he released himself...

43:05.542 --> 43:08.253
'...and set out in search of new alliances,

'You won't believe who he chose.'

43:15.635 --> 43:16.886
Don Chepe.

43:18.847 --> 43:20.765
I was happy to get your call.

43:22.434 --> 43:25.645
'Predictably,
it wasn't much of a partnership.

43:25.770 --> 43:29.357
'It seems the Castaños expected
a larger contribution to their cause...

43:31.401 --> 43:34.279
'...than Chepe was comfortable making.

43:35.363 --> 43:38.158
'So the alliance died quickly.

43:38.283 --> 43:42.078
'And Chepe Santacruz's wild ride
came to an end.

43:44.497 --> 43:47.751
'Pacho Herrera didn't fare
much better staying in jail.

43:47.876 --> 43:50.086
'Vendettas in the drug game
never end.'

43:51.588 --> 43:54.257
'And Pacho's war on the Salazars

43:54.382 --> 43:57.052
'made him some lifelong
North Valley enemies.

44:01.848 --> 44:03.308
Motherfucker!

44:06.895 --> 44:09.189
'And as for
the Rodríguez-Orejuela brothers,

44:09.314 --> 44:13.193
'political pressure from the U.S.
and a disgraced Colombian president

44:13.318 --> 44:16.363
'who needed to prove
he was tough on narcos

44:16.488 --> 44:22.535
'brought back the only effective weapon
we have in The War on Drugs: extradition.

44:24.579 --> 44:28.500
'All out of favours
and unlikely to find more,

44:28.625 --> 44:32.629
'they will spend the rest of their lives
in a U.S. prison.

44:32.754 --> 44:35.590
'The good guys didn't do much better.

44:35.715 --> 44:39.386
'Back in Colombia, Jorge Salcedo
was publicly branded a rat.'

44:39.511 --> 44:42.889
The danger that he put himself in
to insure the success of our operation...

44:43.014 --> 44:47.185
'And in the States, despite testimony
that he was instrumental to our efforts

44:47.310 --> 44:50.855
'to capture and prosecute
the Cali godfathers,

44:50.980 --> 44:54.859
'he still had to plead guilty
to felony conspiracy charges.

44:56.194 --> 44:58.405
'And from there, Jorge Salcedo...

44:59.614 --> 45:03.660
'...the guy who had the most to do
with bringing down the Cali cartel

45:03.785 --> 45:07.497
'disappeared into the Federal
Witness Protection Program

45:07.622 --> 45:10.291
'somewhere in the U.S.

45:11.751 --> 45:13.962
'A prison of its own.'

45:31.396 --> 45:35.817
- You knew him, right? Agent Camarena?
- Of him.

45:35.942 --> 45:37.861
My first assignment out of the academy

45:37.986 --> 45:40.113
was a task force that
searched for him in Guadalajara.

45:42.115 --> 45:46.453
It all started there. Before him,
we didn't even know we were in a war.

45:47.662 --> 45:49.664
Another hot one down there
for you, huh?

45:49.789 --> 45:51.916
You took down the big players
in Colombia.

45:52.041 --> 45:56.296
Yeah, well... we'll make new ones.

45:56.421 --> 46:00.800
Don't turn a victory into a defeat, Javier.
The Colombian super-cartels are gone.

46:00.925 --> 46:04.429
And whoever comes next are gonna be
fighting amongst themselves for years.

46:04.554 --> 46:08.224
They're still only going to be a shadow
of what Medellín and Cali were.

46:08.349 --> 46:12.353
And now it's time to take the fight
to the real enemy in The War on Drugs.

46:12.479 --> 46:14.272
Mexico.

46:15.315 --> 46:17.066
"The real enemy"?

46:17.859 --> 46:21.863
Let me put in some calls. I'll make
this bullshit resignation go away.

46:24.824 --> 46:27.202
What else is a guy like you gonna do?

46:58.358 --> 47:01.194
All right, fellas. Let's move.
Keep going.

47:03.154 --> 47:04.989
Keep going.

47:47.156 --> 47:49.909
You helping me with this or not?

47:51.077 --> 47:54.873
- I thought I was getting a partner.
- Come on, Pop. Give me that.

47:54.998 --> 47:56.875
Stubborn.

48:00.628 --> 48:04.299
You can stand here
for an hour and count 20 of 'em going by.

48:04.424 --> 48:09.387
So... do you have to fix
the fence every time a storm hits?

48:11.097 --> 48:15.393
Someone has to do it.
That's how life works.

48:22.525 --> 48:25.987
You thinking
of taking them up on it? Mexico?

48:28.156 --> 48:29.991
It's different there.

48:31.034 --> 48:33.119
- Son, let me tell you...
- Dad.

48:35.496 --> 48:37.332
I've done enough.

48:39.918 --> 48:41.753
I'm through.

48:49.302 --> 48:51.262
Hand me that cutter.
