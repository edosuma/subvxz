WEBVTT

00:03.475 --> 00:06.238
I'm sorry, dude.
I'm a little short today.

00:06.272 --> 00:08.256
Can I make you a candle in trade?

00:08.357 --> 00:12.063
Oh yeah, sure. As long as you make one
of those candles look like a twenty.

00:12.097 --> 00:15.601
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's with the titude?

00:15.635 --> 00:18.400
If she wanted somethg rotten,
she'd buy your bananas.

00:18.434 --> 00:20.033
Hey, Maggie. I got it.

00:20.233 --> 00:23.203
No, no, Alex. You do too
much for me already.

00:23.237 --> 00:27.608
I need to thank you for getting
my landlord to lower my rent.

00:27.642 --> 00:31.077
People really underestimate
my arm-wrestling skills.

00:31.112 --> 00:33.846
It's all about wrist
position and a greasy table.

00:35.448 --> 00:36.582
Here I am, sir,

00:36.616 --> 00:38.851
paying for fruit from this table

00:38.885 --> 00:41.949
where I found a bunch
of cockroaches.

00:44.150 --> 00:45.482
Shhhh.

00:45.516 --> 00:48.084
Just pay me half and
get out of here, Russo.

00:49.854 --> 00:53.656
Right on. Stick it to the Man.

00:53.690 --> 00:55.824
You know I hate cheating people.

00:55.858 --> 00:59.160
Maggie, wait till you
taste those mushy apples.

00:59.194 --> 01:01.226
Believe me, we're not
the ones cheating.

01:01.261 --> 01:04.126
Hey, you've got 15 minutes
to beat feet to school.

01:04.161 --> 01:08.963
Actually, 14 because you have
to give me a hug before you go.

01:09.964 --> 01:11.130
Peace, Alex.

01:11.164 --> 01:12.865
Thank you.

01:18.232 --> 01:20.098
I know it sounds weird,

01:20.133 --> 01:21.833
but one of my homework assignments

01:22.034 --> 01:24.266
was to carry grocery bags
to someone's apartment,

01:24.301 --> 01:25.433
and I forgot to do it.

01:25.801 --> 01:27.566
- Alex, I'll be fine.
- It's okay.

01:27.600 --> 01:30.399
All I have to do at school is
read the morning announcements.

01:30.434 --> 01:32.867
- Don't you have classes?
- Oh, I have classes.

01:32.901 --> 01:35.201
The question is, "Which one
of them I'll be going to?"

01:35.235 --> 01:38.769
You know, I love how you
stuck it to the Man.

01:38.804 --> 01:40.303
Sock it to 'em!

01:40.337 --> 01:41.838
Oh, yeah! Come on.

01:41.872 --> 01:44.173
Sock it to 'em! Oh, yeah!

01:44.208 --> 01:47.136
* Well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

01:47.171 --> 01:49.104
* That the end will no
doubt justify the means *

01:49.705 --> 01:51.305
* You can fix any problem
with the slightest of ease *

01:51.340 --> 01:52.940
* Yes, please *

01:52.974 --> 01:54.774
* But you might find out
it'll go to your head *

01:55.376 --> 01:56.575
* When you write a report
on a book you never read *

01:57.310 --> 01:58.910
* With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

01:58.945 --> 02:00.745
* That's what I said *

02:00.779 --> 02:04.082
* Everything is not what it seems *

02:04.116 --> 02:07.719
* You can get all you wanted
in your wildest dreams *

02:07.754 --> 02:11.291
* You might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

02:11.325 --> 02:16.161
* Because everything
is not what it seems *

02:16.195 --> 02:19.296
* Everything is not what it seems *

02:19.330 --> 02:23.098
* When you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

02:23.132 --> 02:26.933
* Be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

02:26.967 --> 02:30.800
* Because everything is not *

02:30.835 --> 02:32.368
* What it seems *

02:32.369 --> 02:39.169

02:39.174 --> 02:42.642
When you highlight, Max,
you don't use a black marker.

02:42.676 --> 02:45.077
- That... makes it disappear.
- Oh, my gosh!

02:45.111 --> 02:47.379
Ssh! Dude, that's
Jeanette Brocoletti.

02:48.581 --> 02:50.949
Someday I'm going to ask her out.

02:50.983 --> 02:52.383
Why not now?

02:52.417 --> 02:54.584
Well.. Because, I...

02:54.618 --> 02:56.719
I don't know what to say, and...

02:56.753 --> 02:58.920
I think I smell like teriyaki.

02:58.955 --> 03:02.089
Oh! You do.
Did you spill on yourself?

03:02.123 --> 03:07.426
Let's just say this is not
the front of my shirt.

03:07.460 --> 03:09.727
OK, look. Let me
give you some advice.

03:09.762 --> 03:11.696
If you want to talk to Jeanette,

03:11.897 --> 03:13.964
all you gotta do is go up
to her and make her laugh.

03:13.999 --> 03:16.400
Girls love guys who
can make 'em laugh.

03:16.434 --> 03:19.602
All right. I'll give
that a shot. - Good.

03:19.637 --> 03:20.937
Oh! Wait.

03:20.971 --> 03:24.672
Are you setting me
up for something bad?

03:24.707 --> 03:27.574
No. But should have.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.541
It would've been a great joke.
I'm too nice.

03:37.915 --> 03:39.315
Oh, hey, Jeanette.

03:39.350 --> 03:41.650
Hey!

03:41.685 --> 03:43.718
Bet you wanna know what
I'm laughing about?

03:43.886 --> 03:47.187
Yeah. We all do. That's why
they sent me over here.

03:47.221 --> 03:50.189
I will tell you.

03:50.224 --> 03:51.557
See that girl over there?

03:51.925 --> 03:54.159
Her hair looks like
spaghetti in a ponytail.

03:54.194 --> 03:58.328
And where does she get her clothes,
Forever 1985?

03:58.363 --> 04:01.464
Max, that's my best friend.

04:03.166 --> 04:04.733
I'm just gonna go.

04:05.701 --> 04:07.835
Max, it's OK.

04:07.869 --> 04:09.769
Sarah makes fun of me sometimes.

04:09.804 --> 04:12.204
Because your eyes
are too far apart?

04:12.705 --> 04:13.738
What?

04:14.907 --> 04:16.574
You think my eyes
are too far apart?

04:16.608 --> 04:18.242
No! Not for me.

04:18.276 --> 04:20.411
I wish they were further apart.

04:20.445 --> 04:22.912
Change the subject.

04:22.947 --> 04:26.548
I kinda wanted to ask
you out on a date.

04:26.582 --> 04:28.315
Why don't you just ask me?

04:28.350 --> 04:29.850
'Cause I blew it.

04:29.884 --> 04:32.018
Go ahead.

04:33.054 --> 04:34.754
Nah. I'm just gonna wreck it.

04:36.222 --> 04:37.756
Max.

04:37.790 --> 04:39.357
I'm giving you a second chance,

04:39.392 --> 04:41.159
because I think
you're kind of funny.

04:41.194 --> 04:43.729
Oh. OK, well... That's fine.

04:43.763 --> 04:45.363
But I don't think it's gonna work.

04:47.131 --> 04:50.500
Uh, Jeanette...

04:50.534 --> 04:51.867
Do you want to go out with me?

04:51.902 --> 04:53.602
Nah.

04:55.638 --> 04:56.571
What?

04:56.605 --> 04:58.906
Just kidding.

05:00.208 --> 05:02.809
Give me a call.

05:02.843 --> 05:04.811
Whoa. Jeanette, thank you!

05:04.845 --> 05:06.813
It totally worked, bro.

05:06.847 --> 05:08.514
You were funny and she liked you.

05:08.649 --> 05:11.683
Really? I wasn't even
trying to be funny.

05:11.717 --> 05:13.951
I barely knew what was going on.

05:16.321 --> 05:18.156
Believe me, dude,
when it comes to girls

05:18.190 --> 05:20.057
that's always the best way.

05:23.528 --> 05:27.498
Hello. Alex, where are you?
Second period is starting.

05:27.532 --> 05:30.468
Yeah, the hallway's clear. OK.

05:30.502 --> 05:33.737
Help me travel on my own.
I need to get there through this phone.

05:35.807 --> 05:37.340
Thanks, Harper.

05:37.475 --> 05:39.943
I would've gotten here sooner
but I dialed the wrong number.

05:39.977 --> 05:41.744
There's this really
confused guy in India

05:41.878 --> 05:43.645
with my footprint on
the side of his face.

05:44.947 --> 05:46.550
Alex, Mr. Laritate's
really mad at you

05:46.851 --> 05:48.685
because you flaked out
on morning announcements.

05:48.887 --> 05:51.386
He had the kid with the rubber
bands on his braces do them.

05:51.421 --> 05:53.421
I'm not sure if he said
"Friday is Picture Day"

05:53.456 --> 05:56.724
or "Fried eggs in pickled hay."

05:56.759 --> 06:00.127
It doesn't matter.
I'm going to be ready for both.

06:00.161 --> 06:02.995
I better get to Geometry.
No. English. No.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.930
Government. Oh. Whatever the
class isefore Mr. Laritate...

06:05.964 --> 06:07.397
Sees you?

06:09.099 --> 06:11.099
Sit by the window in detention.

06:11.134 --> 06:13.335
I'll throw you some CornNuts.

06:18.340 --> 06:20.107
No more detention for you.

06:20.442 --> 06:22.743
I came to that decision when
you brought a blow-up mattress

06:22.778 --> 06:25.479
and clock radio that
made ocean noises.

06:25.514 --> 06:26.981
To the hoosegow.

06:27.983 --> 06:29.617
I don't know what hoosegow means,

06:29.952 --> 06:32.420
but I'm pretty sure it
doesn't mean ice cream stand.

06:38.392 --> 06:39.325
Blueberry or apple?

06:39.359 --> 06:40.559
Apple.

06:42.429 --> 06:44.263
T marshmallows.

06:45.498 --> 06:48.766
Hey, nice new Navajo blanket.

06:48.801 --> 06:51.368
Thanks, I picked it
up at a yard sale.

06:51.403 --> 06:54.670
Oh. It really ties
the room together.

06:56.238 --> 06:58.806
You're in here way too often.

06:58.841 --> 07:01.308
Hey, dude, that's your call,
not mine.

07:03.178 --> 07:04.945
Miss Russo,

07:04.979 --> 07:09.383
I used to fancy myself a little
bit of an outlaw like you.

07:09.417 --> 07:11.651
I used to belly up
to the soda fountain

07:11.686 --> 07:14.953
and have a glass of all the
flavors mixed together.

07:14.987 --> 07:18.055
They called it soda danger.

07:18.089 --> 07:20.057
I called it breakfast.

07:20.091 --> 07:23.593
That all changed when the
doctor called it a peptic ulcer.

07:23.627 --> 07:25.295
Do you see where I'm
going with this?

07:25.629 --> 07:29.732
No, but I rarely do when
we have these talks.

07:30.634 --> 07:32.168
I'm talking about...

07:34.504 --> 07:36.371
...howkipping morning announcements

07:36.505 --> 07:39.707
is the latest in a long
line of your selfish acts.

07:39.742 --> 07:42.710
If it's not putting an "out of
order" sign on the girls' bathroom

07:42.744 --> 07:44.578
just so you can watch the panic...

07:44.613 --> 07:47.080
That was a good one.

07:47.114 --> 07:51.383
Then it's having the library
order up your fashion magazines.

07:51.418 --> 07:53.085
Oh, that reminds me.

07:53.119 --> 07:56.288
I need them to renew "
Hot Rods and Handbags."

07:56.322 --> 08:00.058
Here's what we're going to do
to break this selfish streak.

08:00.092 --> 08:02.260
You're going to join
the Happy Helpers club.

08:02.294 --> 08:05.696
Oh, two things I don't like:
clubs and helping.

08:05.730 --> 08:08.198
I'm not a fan of happy either.
So throw that in, too.

08:09.867 --> 08:12.001
If you don't join,
you'll be suspended.

08:12.035 --> 08:14.603
And don't think you can skip it,
because I'm the advisor.

08:14.637 --> 08:16.605
Fine.

08:16.639 --> 08:21.108
I'm not going to lie,
I still might try.

08:21.143 --> 08:22.843
ax] I got a date. I got a date.

08:22.878 --> 08:24.445
Dad! I got a date.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.080
Max, I told you.

08:26.115 --> 08:28.349
If a girl comes in and
asks if you do take-out,

08:28.383 --> 08:30.684
it doesn't mean she
wants to take you out.

08:30.718 --> 08:35.153
No, a real date with
Jeanette Brocoletti.

08:35.188 --> 08:37.388
Really? Atta boy.

08:37.423 --> 08:38.990
"Atta boy" what?

08:39.024 --> 08:41.691
Our son is about to
go onis first date.

08:41.726 --> 08:44.461
No, he isn't. He's only 13.

08:44.495 --> 08:47.796
- Mom.
- Come on, Theresa.

08:47.831 --> 08:50.732
I'm a reasonable person.

08:50.766 --> 08:53.402
Your father and I will
chaperone the date. OK?

08:53.436 --> 08:54.970
And it has to happen in here.

08:55.104 --> 08:58.740
I don't know, guys.
Let me ask Justin.

08:58.775 --> 09:00.476
Justin!

09:00.510 --> 09:01.844
Hey.

09:01.878 --> 09:05.180
Mom and Dad want to
chaperone me on my date.

09:05.214 --> 09:06.181
Oh!

09:06.215 --> 09:09.617
Sounds more like a play date.

09:09.651 --> 09:13.020
My expertise in romance got you this far.
Let me give you a hand.

09:13.054 --> 09:15.121
Guys. I can chaperone him.

09:15.156 --> 09:19.358
Oh, look at my big boy
looking after my little boy.

09:19.393 --> 09:20.826
You're taking me out that night.

09:20.960 --> 09:22.961
- Movie in Times Square?
- Yeah.

09:23.195 --> 09:25.996
We can make fun of tourists who visit
New York and eat at chain restaurants?

09:26.031 --> 09:29.232
- I love you.
- Me too.

09:31.802 --> 09:35.004
OK, Justin, one last favor.

09:35.038 --> 09:36.572
Can you pretend to be the waiter,

09:36.940 --> 09:38.206
so she doesn't know
I'm being chaperoned?

09:39.041 --> 09:41.142
Yeah, dude. No problem. I've got a
suit that I've been dying to wear

09:41.176 --> 09:44.979
since Grandma made that
miraculous recovery.

09:46.000 --> 09:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:00.927 --> 10:05.330
Out.

10:05.364 --> 10:08.132
Thanks for joining the Happy
Helpers Club with me, Harper.

10:08.166 --> 10:10.534
No problem. I don't want
to see you get suspended.

10:10.869 --> 10:14.504
I don't like hearing what teachers say
about you when you're not at school.

10:14.538 --> 10:18.106
Well, this club
might not be so bad.

10:18.140 --> 10:21.041
Yeah, it's not like they have
a club cheer or anything.

10:22.377 --> 10:24.244
Did I just set it up?

10:24.278 --> 10:26.446
I think you did.

10:26.481 --> 10:28.114
Happy Helpers! Happy Helpers!

10:28.149 --> 10:29.482
That's what we are!

10:29.517 --> 10:30.750
Helping people! Helping people!

10:30.951 --> 10:32.852
Helping near and far! Yay!

10:34.754 --> 10:36.689
OK, Happy Helpers.

10:36.723 --> 10:39.224
Before we start our jamboree,

10:39.258 --> 10:44.060
I'd like to welcome Alex Russo
and Harper Finkle to our posse.

10:44.094 --> 10:45.094
Club.

10:45.129 --> 10:46.663
Right. Club.

10:48.231 --> 10:49.598
Now, let's go over

10:50.067 --> 10:52.736
who participated in this
week's community work.

10:52.770 --> 10:55.539
Did anyone throw away a
candy wrapper they found?

10:55.573 --> 10:57.707
Good.

10:57.742 --> 11:01.711
Did anyone push an elevator
button for someone else?

11:01.746 --> 11:03.580
Good!

11:03.614 --> 11:06.481
Wait. These are the
good deeds they do?

11:06.516 --> 11:08.282
That's just stuff they
should do every day.

11:08.317 --> 11:11.785
I made change for a dollar.

11:16.390 --> 11:18.191
OK. This week we need someone

11:18.225 --> 11:20.826
to close the front door
when the bell rings.

11:20.860 --> 11:22.694
Eeny, meeny, miny..

11:22.728 --> 11:24.229
Alex.

11:26.131 --> 11:28.532
That's great, Alex.
Whenever we do volunteer work,

11:28.567 --> 11:32.502
we get awards and ribbons
to put in our Spirit Books.

11:32.537 --> 11:35.538
They're what make us Happy Helpers.

11:37.340 --> 11:39.975
A ribbon for closing the door?

11:40.010 --> 11:41.610
Harper, you see what's going on?

11:41.644 --> 11:43.512
They don't care about
helping people.

11:43.980 --> 11:47.682
They only care about getting credit
for doing nothing. I'm out of here.

11:47.716 --> 11:51.585
If anyone wants to close the door
behind me and get a ribbon, feel free.

11:51.619 --> 11:54.387
No.

11:54.422 --> 11:57.490
Alex, if you don't stay in this class,
you're going to get suspended.

12:00.493 --> 12:02.760
Mr. Laritate, I just
gave Alex good advice.

12:02.794 --> 12:04.895
How many ribbons is that worth?

12:08.733 --> 12:11.300
I'll split them with you.

12:16.005 --> 12:20.173
Hey Alex, what's
with the bummer face?

12:20.208 --> 12:22.675
The Man come down on you?

12:23.777 --> 12:25.144
Yeah.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.945
The Man said I was being selfish

12:27.180 --> 12:30.214
so he made me join a stupid
club to teach me a lesson.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.917
You mean like a commune?

12:32.951 --> 12:34.918
Don't knock it till
you've tried it.

12:34.952 --> 12:37.987
No. It's the Happy Helpers Club.

12:38.022 --> 12:41.356
Who are supposed to be all
about helping the community

12:41.391 --> 12:43.959
but really they're just
all about themselves.

12:43.993 --> 12:46.260
Oh, man. That's bogus.

12:46.295 --> 12:48.829
You are one of the most...

12:48.864 --> 12:50.064
Oh!

12:50.098 --> 12:51.965
...unselfish...

12:52.000 --> 12:54.668
...coolest chicks I know.

12:54.702 --> 12:56.436
That's the truth, Ruth.

12:56.471 --> 12:58.739
Mm! It's Maggie.

12:58.773 --> 13:00.240
It's an expression.

13:00.274 --> 13:01.374
Ah!

13:01.409 --> 13:02.509
Respect.

13:04.078 --> 13:06.679
This club does stuff like...

13:06.713 --> 13:08.480
...telling someone
their shoe's untied

13:08.514 --> 13:10.783
and then they call
that community service.

13:10.817 --> 13:12.551
Man, I know where
you're coming from.

13:12.786 --> 13:16.188
Back in '68 I was very
into the peace movement.

13:16.223 --> 13:19.925
You know? Marching,
talking to people, organizing.

13:19.960 --> 13:23.462
Then one day, I went to
a campus peace rally.

13:23.497 --> 13:26.799
Well, these guys weren't into
working for peace at all.

13:26.834 --> 13:31.070
They were just using the whole scene so
they could rebel against their parents.

13:31.105 --> 13:32.371
Blew my mind.

13:32.406 --> 13:34.474
So then you just bailed, right?

13:34.508 --> 13:37.977
Hm? No way, LBJ.

13:38.011 --> 13:39.144
What?

13:39.179 --> 13:41.847
Well, it's an expression.

13:41.881 --> 13:43.982
Respect.

13:45.785 --> 13:49.154
Look, my friends may be
puppets of the establishment,

13:49.188 --> 13:51.990
but my cause was righteous.

13:52.025 --> 13:56.195
So I grabbed my bullhorn
and I spoke the truth.

13:56.229 --> 13:58.830
- Spoke the truth.
- Yeah! Right on.

13:58.865 --> 14:03.501
You know, you should
try it sometime.

14:05.372 --> 14:07.573
I can dig it. Thanks.

14:09.576 --> 14:13.279
Yeah. Stick it to the Man!

14:13.313 --> 14:15.881
Sock it to 'em!
Sock it to 'em! Oh, yeah!

14:15.915 --> 14:18.217
Sock it to 'em!
Sock it to 'em! Oh, yeah!

14:18.251 --> 14:19.284
Sock it to 'em!

14:25.125 --> 14:26.291
Excuse me.

14:26.426 --> 14:30.795
We have a reservation.
Russo, party of two.

14:30.830 --> 14:33.064
Yes, you do. Your
table's right over here.

14:33.098 --> 14:36.099
Wow, Max. Pretty impressive,
having your own waiter.

14:38.036 --> 14:43.039
That's rht,
I do have my own waiter.

14:43.074 --> 14:44.274
Is this table all right?

14:44.742 --> 14:46.643
It's the one that I set
up with the tablecloth.

14:46.677 --> 14:47.977
I'm OK here.

14:48.011 --> 14:50.612
No. Look, you don't
have to be nice to him.

14:50.647 --> 14:52.380
He's my waiter.

14:54.784 --> 14:56.218
We'd like to move over there.

14:57.820 --> 14:59.354
She said she was fine here.

14:59.389 --> 15:01.056
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

15:01.090 --> 15:03.358
Lose the 'tude, waiter dude.

15:05.462 --> 15:08.197
The lady would be more
comfortable over there.

15:23.847 --> 15:26.581
Will you excuse me a moment,
Jeanette?

15:28.885 --> 15:31.019
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

15:31.154 --> 15:33.455
I'm being funny in front of
my date like you told me to.

15:33.589 --> 15:36.524
You think ordering me around and
treating me like this is funny?

15:36.559 --> 15:40.095
Yeah, you're pretty mad,
so I think it's hilarious.

15:42.531 --> 15:44.231
Jeanette, I am so sorry.

15:44.266 --> 15:46.466
I wonder if our waiter
comes with chips,

15:46.501 --> 15:49.068
because he is a dip.

15:50.604 --> 15:52.037
Hey, waiter.

15:52.238 --> 15:57.341
Do you think you can handle
getting us some water?

16:04.550 --> 16:05.483
Ah!

16:05.517 --> 16:07.351
The fizzy type.

16:07.386 --> 16:08.686
Yes.

16:08.720 --> 16:11.789
The lady and I would
love the fizzy type.

16:19.799 --> 16:22.034
Is that fizzy enough for you, sir?

16:23.536 --> 16:25.838
He is so funny.

16:25.872 --> 16:27.206
And cute.

16:29.208 --> 16:31.910
Jeanette, what do you mean by cute?

16:31.945 --> 16:34.146
Cute like he looks cute? Or...

16:34.280 --> 16:37.349
...cute like when I put pretzel
sticks up my nose and my mom goes:

16:37.383 --> 16:38.950
"Cute."

16:38.985 --> 16:40.418
That sounds funny.

16:40.453 --> 16:41.720
Oh, yeah it is.

16:41.921 --> 16:44.256
Hey, waiter, where are
our pretzel sticks?

16:50.030 --> 16:52.264
You had your chance.

16:53.967 --> 16:55.167
Hey!

16:55.201 --> 16:58.470
Before you mop that up,
let's hear the specials.

17:04.144 --> 17:05.844
For the lady,

17:06.012 --> 17:08.646
I'd recommend losing the boy with
the bloody nose in his future

17:08.781 --> 17:12.083
and having dinner with someone
that can make you laugh, for real.

17:12.117 --> 17:15.319
And for the boy, I'd recommend
the dinosaur chicken strips

17:15.354 --> 17:18.789
with a side of wet wipes.

17:18.823 --> 17:20.691
I'll go get you a bib
and some crayons.

17:20.724 --> 17:22.859
If you stay inside the lines...

17:22.894 --> 17:25.028
I'll put it on the wall.

17:28.430 --> 17:29.864
Will you excuse me, please?

17:33.368 --> 17:36.003
Pound for pound, you're a clown.

17:39.107 --> 17:42.808
Back to our date.

17:42.843 --> 17:45.944
Let's get this party started.

17:49.782 --> 17:51.649
Is there something in my nose?

17:59.590 --> 18:01.391
Oh!

18:01.425 --> 18:03.960
Uh-oh. Justin!

18:12.768 --> 18:16.269
You think this is hilarious,
don't you?

18:16.304 --> 18:18.438
Yes. Yes, I do.

18:22.576 --> 18:25.144
Yeah. It's pretty funny.

18:28.414 --> 18:30.115
You got me.

18:30.149 --> 18:33.217
Actually, you got yourself.

18:33.251 --> 18:34.752
I did.

18:34.786 --> 18:37.588
Hello? Are we having a date or not?

18:37.622 --> 18:40.391
Relax, we'll get back
to the date in a second.

18:42.994 --> 18:44.261
I guess I had it coming to me.

18:44.295 --> 18:45.962
What were you thinking?

18:46.230 --> 18:50.166
I'm thinking that when I'm mean
and insulting that it's funny.

18:50.200 --> 18:53.502
But it might only be me.

18:53.536 --> 18:56.004
Why don't you ask Jeanette?

19:00.743 --> 19:02.943
Yeah, it's only me.

19:05.113 --> 19:06.245
Man.

19:06.280 --> 19:08.648
That was my first
date and I ruined it.

19:08.682 --> 19:11.384
There will be plenty
of other dates,

19:11.418 --> 19:15.053
and you'll find different
ways to ruin those too.

19:15.088 --> 19:18.590
Hey, I started the
dino chicken strips.

19:18.624 --> 19:21.825
- You did? I call the T-rexes.
- Of course.

19:24.796 --> 19:26.463
I got another ribbon.

19:28.399 --> 19:30.667
No more for her.

19:32.737 --> 19:33.904
Alex, where were you?

19:34.239 --> 19:36.307
You missed seeing me
get all these ribbons.

19:36.341 --> 19:39.076
Ribbons for what?
This is only your second meeting.

19:39.110 --> 19:41.345
This one is for coming
to a second meeting.

19:43.080 --> 19:48.215
This next award goes to Alex
Russo for clapping erasers.

19:48.250 --> 19:51.518
I wasn't clapping erasers.
I was trying to hit the clock

19:51.553 --> 19:53.620
to see if I could get
it to move forward.

19:53.654 --> 19:56.622
Repairing a stuck clock.
Even better.

19:56.657 --> 19:58.090
Come on up and get your ribbon.

19:58.224 --> 20:00.125
No. Wait.

20:00.159 --> 20:03.027
You want to give me a ribbon
for something I didn't even do?

20:03.061 --> 20:05.029
You honestly see nothing
wrong with that?

20:05.063 --> 20:06.864
I don't.

20:06.898 --> 20:09.934
It's about time I got
some appreciation, Mom.

20:19.277 --> 20:21.946
It's stick it to the Man time.

20:21.980 --> 20:25.882
I'm sorry, Mr. Laritate. I can't take
that ribbon. I didn't do anything.

20:25.917 --> 20:27.818
And even if I had,
I still wouldn't take it.

20:27.852 --> 20:30.153
I'll take it.

20:30.188 --> 20:31.455
Oh! Sorry.

20:32.924 --> 20:36.260
I was told I had to join
this club or get suspended.

20:37.629 --> 20:41.264
Most of you know me.
That's not a shocker.

20:41.299 --> 20:44.601
You think you're helping the community,
but you're hardly doing anything.

20:44.635 --> 20:47.470
And you do it for selfish reasons.

20:47.504 --> 20:50.139
Now, I know I can be
a little selfish too,

20:50.174 --> 20:52.241
because I don't help
a lot of people.

20:52.276 --> 20:54.143
But I know when I do.

20:54.244 --> 20:57.613
I do more than this and I don't
expect anything in return.

20:57.647 --> 20:59.682
I don't even do it to
make myself feel better.

20:59.850 --> 21:01.784
I do it to make the other
person feel better.

21:03.253 --> 21:04.586
Wow.

21:04.621 --> 21:07.590
That was a very moving speech...

21:07.624 --> 21:08.924
...worthy of a ribbon.

21:08.959 --> 21:10.292
No!

21:10.327 --> 21:11.293
No.

21:11.328 --> 21:13.095
I don't want a ribbon.

21:13.130 --> 21:14.997
It's either the
ribbon or suspension.

21:15.031 --> 21:16.765
That's a lovely ribbon.

21:22.358 --> 21:24.325
There you go, Mr. Laritate.

21:24.359 --> 21:26.460
You're going to look great
for 60's Day at school.

21:26.494 --> 21:28.896
- Thank you, Alex.
- Yeah, she's the best.

21:28.930 --> 21:32.432
You know, she really
understands flower power.

21:32.467 --> 21:34.767
Flower power? I don't get it.

21:34.802 --> 21:36.268
It means you're generous, Alex.

21:36.837 --> 21:39.271
I don't know why you didn't
tell me you were a Happy Helper.

21:39.305 --> 21:42.206
Nope, not a Happy Helper.
An unhappy troublemaker

21:42.241 --> 21:44.775
who quietly does good
without anyone knowing.

21:46.144 --> 21:47.411
I can dig it.

21:48.179 --> 21:50.180
So I'm not suspended?

21:50.215 --> 21:51.882
Whoa!

21:51.916 --> 21:53.517
You mean you're the Man?

21:53.551 --> 21:57.721
And I was gonna give you a candle.

21:59.023 --> 22:00.457
Alex, I'll make you a deal.

22:00.825 --> 22:02.926
I'll suspend the suspension
if you'll show more

22:02.961 --> 22:05.062
flower power around school.

22:05.097 --> 22:06.998
And I'll try to get
the Happy Helpers

22:07.033 --> 22:09.434
to start calling your club a posse.

22:10.569 --> 22:11.836
Deal.

22:14.540 --> 22:17.909
But I'm still gonna have
to make fun of your outfit.

22:17.944 --> 22:20.479
I would expect nothing less.

22:21.381 --> 22:22.681
Right on.

22:22.715 --> 22:23.451
Oh, yeah! I can dig it.
