00:06.781 --> 00:08.847
Previously, on <i>House of Lies</i>...

00:08.901 --> 00:10.201
Rich little
14-year-old over here

00:10.275 --> 00:12.209
thinks he got the moves.
Biter?

00:12.283 --> 00:13.315
Biter.

00:13.316 --> 00:15.248
<i>Listen. I don't care</i>

00:15.249 --> 00:17.682
what your grandpa said.

00:17.683 --> 00:19.416
When I tell you
to do something, you...

00:22.816 --> 00:25.148
You take Colossal Foods,
I take Free Range.

00:25.149 --> 00:28.515
We share a little intel,
play both companies

00:28.516 --> 00:30.382
against the middle,
keep them on the hook

00:30.383 --> 00:32.548
forever.

00:32.549 --> 00:35.148
I just landed us
a multi-year contract

00:35.149 --> 00:36.815
with the Department of Justice.

00:36.816 --> 00:37.782
That is huge.

00:37.783 --> 00:39.482
And the small caveat

00:39.483 --> 00:42.282
is that we need
to dump DollaHyde.

00:42.283 --> 00:44.115
Oh. See, that's a big caveat.

00:44.116 --> 00:45.582
What if I could deliver some

00:45.583 --> 00:47.548
<i>incriminating financial records</i>

00:47.549 --> 00:49.648
<i>on Lukas Frye and Dre Collins?</i>

00:49.649 --> 00:51.715
Could we trade that
for the DOJ contract?

00:51.716 --> 00:52.948
Absolutely.

00:52.949 --> 00:54.915
Hey...

00:54.916 --> 00:56.915
What?

00:56.916 --> 00:58.283
I love you.

01:33.683 --> 01:35.683
Hey.

01:39.516 --> 01:40.715
You're here.

01:40.716 --> 01:42.748
Yep.

01:42.749 --> 01:44.182
It's my house.

01:44.183 --> 01:46.416
Right.

01:48.016 --> 01:50.015
Are you making me breakfast?

01:50.016 --> 01:51.682
I am.

01:51.683 --> 01:52.948
Pancakes.

01:52.949 --> 01:54.915
Look at this.

01:54.916 --> 01:57.349
See? You gotta whip the shit
out of these eggs whites.

01:58.283 --> 02:00.048
Uh-oh.
What?

02:00.049 --> 02:01.848
I just got very turned on

02:01.849 --> 02:03.148
when you said that.

02:03.149 --> 02:05.349
Oh.

02:11.483 --> 02:12.615
Marty?

02:12.616 --> 02:13.848
Yeah?

02:13.849 --> 02:15.949
Whatever this is,
I really like it.

02:17.349 --> 02:19.349
Me, too.

02:20.516 --> 02:22.415
Can we keep doing it?

02:22.416 --> 02:24.048
Yeah, we can keep doing it.

02:24.049 --> 02:25.982
Let's keep doing it.

02:25.983 --> 02:27.582
For a really long time.

02:27.583 --> 02:29.549
Okay.

02:39.649 --> 02:41.382
We're gonna do this, right?

02:41.383 --> 02:43.615
I mean, we gotta do it.

02:43.616 --> 02:45.048
I don't think I can,

02:45.049 --> 02:46.148
again.

02:46.149 --> 02:47.348
I mean, I want to...

02:47.349 --> 02:48.648
but I don't...
honestly, I don't

02:48.649 --> 02:49.915
think I can handle it.
Oh, come on.

02:49.916 --> 02:51.348
You-you know
what I meant.

02:51.349 --> 02:53.415
Okay. Yes.

02:53.416 --> 02:55.082
You're saying yes
to a real date?

02:55.083 --> 02:56.748
A real date.

02:56.749 --> 02:58.115
For reals.

02:58.116 --> 02:59.415
Tonight.

02:59.416 --> 03:00.715
Tonight.

03:00.716 --> 03:01.982
Jeannie, I will make

03:01.983 --> 03:03.415
a fucking reservation, okay?
Okay.

03:03.416 --> 03:04.682
Make it.
I'll be there.

03:04.683 --> 03:05.948
Okay.

03:05.949 --> 03:07.349
Okay.
I'm serious.

03:11.749 --> 03:12.715
No, don't...

03:12.716 --> 03:13.715
I got to, I got to.

03:13.716 --> 03:15.716
Come on.

03:17.749 --> 03:19.315
Dougie.
No Doug.

03:19.316 --> 03:21.016
Sorry, Doug.
Mama says no.

03:27.016 --> 03:28.382
Oy.

03:28.383 --> 03:29.715
Busy.

03:29.716 --> 03:31.215
Doug again.
No.

03:31.216 --> 03:33.516
No.
We already had this discussion.

03:44.649 --> 03:45.883
It's Clyde.

03:48.616 --> 03:50.583
Doug, again.

03:51.983 --> 03:52.982
Hey.
Hi, Doug.

03:52.983 --> 03:55.482
Clyde, slow down, man.

03:55.483 --> 03:56.748
Are you crying?

03:56.749 --> 03:58.015
What?

03:58.016 --> 04:00.683
Bullshit.

04:05.083 --> 04:06.283
Fuck me.

04:08.316 --> 04:09.748
No unauthorized personnel...

04:09.749 --> 04:11.583
Yeah, these...

04:15.254 --> 04:16.815
Do you have any idea
what this is about?

04:16.815 --> 04:18.281
No.

04:18.283 --> 04:19.483
I have no idea.

04:23.483 --> 04:25.415
Hey.

04:25.416 --> 04:27.215
Excuse me.

04:27.216 --> 04:29.382
Do you mind telling me
what the fuck is going on?

04:29.383 --> 04:31.282
Actually, yeah, I do.

04:31.283 --> 04:32.415
Who the fuck are you?

04:32.416 --> 04:34.282
Watch yourself.
I'm... Jesus.

04:34.283 --> 04:36.048
I'm Marty Kaan.

04:36.049 --> 04:37.115
This is my company.

04:37.116 --> 04:38.382
And... and hers.

04:38.383 --> 04:39.582
Could I see some ID?

04:39.583 --> 04:42.083
Some ID.

04:46.083 --> 04:47.682
Man of the hour.

04:47.683 --> 04:48.948
My professional opinion,

04:48.949 --> 04:50.849
you are deeply fucked.

04:53.683 --> 04:55.582
This doesn't say what
it is specifically

04:55.583 --> 04:56.782
that you're looking for.

04:56.783 --> 04:58.148
What do you think
I'm looking for?

04:58.149 --> 04:59.515
Seriously, Columbo?

04:59.516 --> 05:01.015
How 'bout you just
tell me what it is

05:01.016 --> 05:02.348
you are looking for?
Then maybe I can

05:02.349 --> 05:03.448
help you guys find it.
Marty,

05:03.449 --> 05:04.482
I think we just need
to call Ben Hyam.

05:04.483 --> 05:05.548
Yeah, or you and your friends

05:05.549 --> 05:06.682
can get the fuck
out of my office

05:06.683 --> 05:08.148
until we can reach counsel.
How about that?

05:08.149 --> 05:09.782
You don't have
that luxury, Mr. Kaan.

05:09.783 --> 05:11.582
I'm just here
executing a warrant.

05:11.583 --> 05:12.915
You can go in
the conference room

05:12.916 --> 05:14.448
and wait with your associates.

05:14.449 --> 05:15.982
Or not.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.048
I didn't give you a choice.

05:17.049 --> 05:18.648
You can do that now.

05:18.649 --> 05:19.949
Okay.
Let's go.

05:21.849 --> 05:23.482
<i>What did they say?</i>

05:23.483 --> 05:24.882
We can't leave.
We can't leave.

05:24.883 --> 05:26.415
What is going on, huh?
Who did this?

05:26.416 --> 05:27.548
Was it your fucking
crazy bitch ex-wife?

05:27.549 --> 05:28.848
Is that who did this?

05:28.849 --> 05:30.148
Well, you know, I'm not
actually experiencing

05:30.149 --> 05:31.382
an enemy shortage at this point,

05:31.383 --> 05:32.782
but if I was guessing,

05:32.783 --> 05:34.115
I'm gonna say...
It's gotta be about DollaHyde.

05:34.116 --> 05:36.215
It's 100%...
No, no. We have no exposure on that.

05:36.216 --> 05:38.215
They're not gonna prosecute you

05:38.216 --> 05:40.315
for killing Lukas's dog.
We don't know that, Clyde.

05:40.316 --> 05:42.015
Really? The FBI is gonna be here
I have blood on my hands.

05:42.016 --> 05:44.182
'Cause you gave a little bit
of chocolate to a fucking dog.

05:44.183 --> 05:46.015
Hey, hey, do we need to do
this right now? Please?

05:46.016 --> 05:47.548
Okay, I'm fine.
That's not all.

05:47.549 --> 05:50.115
I probably need to...
air something out

05:50.116 --> 05:52.382
that may or may not
come to light in the course

05:52.383 --> 05:53.715
- of this investigation.
- Spill it, Guggenheim.

05:53.716 --> 05:56.248
Here goes. Okay, Marty,
you know that I-I-I tend to be

05:56.249 --> 05:57.882
a little...
what, humorous,

05:57.883 --> 06:01.548
devil-may-care, uh, hell,
even insouciant in my e-mails.

06:01.549 --> 06:04.415
Okay. And, uh, so I may or may not
have referred to you

06:04.416 --> 06:06.682
as a "Stalinesque man-child
who's threatened

06:06.683 --> 06:08.415
by my Ivy League education."
Okay.

06:08.416 --> 06:09.615
So humorous.

06:09.616 --> 06:10.648
- Right, yeah.
- Yeah.

06:10.649 --> 06:12.448
So it's a joke.
It's a <i> joke.</i>

06:12.449 --> 06:13.882
Great.

06:13.883 --> 06:16.282
And, uh, Jeannie as
a "come-guzzling backwater

06:16.283 --> 06:17.382
gutter slut."
Jesus.

06:17.383 --> 06:18.915
In context,
it's-it's funny.

06:18.916 --> 06:20.548
And I like Stalin.
So let's not forget that.

06:20.549 --> 06:21.448
The man stopped Hitler,

06:21.449 --> 06:23.682
so big fan, right?
And there may be more.

06:23.683 --> 06:26.415
Lots and lots and lots more, okay?
But I want you all to know

06:26.416 --> 06:27.948
that it's all in good fun.

06:27.949 --> 06:29.315
And I know that you're,
you know, suffering

06:29.316 --> 06:30.382
and worried about
your business surviving,

06:30.383 --> 06:32.082
and blah, blah, blah,
but my novel was

06:32.083 --> 06:34.282
on my hard drive...
Oh, I'm sorry, what...

06:34.283 --> 06:36.548
I'm sorry, it sounded like
you said your "novel."

06:36.549 --> 06:39.248
Yeah, that's right, Marty, some
of us have literary ambition,

06:39.249 --> 06:41.582
and, uh, well, I would thank you
not to besmirch that.

06:41.583 --> 06:43.482
No, no, 'cause that
would be Stalinesque.

06:43.483 --> 06:46.648
- Ho-ho-ho!
- So, Doug, we are trapped here

06:46.649 --> 06:49.615
in this fucking conference room,
and we do need

06:49.616 --> 06:51.882
a little diversion... and because
Please don't.

06:51.883 --> 06:52.948
You will never,

06:52.949 --> 06:54.615
ever have another
chance to do this,

06:54.616 --> 06:56.782
because literally, at any
other point in our lives,

06:56.783 --> 06:59.248
we'd rather be eating
shit-encrusted razor blades

06:59.249 --> 07:00.982
than listen to this bullshit.
Marty...

07:00.983 --> 07:03.648
Oh, let's...
elevator pitch.

07:03.649 --> 07:04.983
What's your novel about?

07:06.049 --> 07:08.648
Yeah. Okay. Okay.

07:08.649 --> 07:11.215
You have to get on that side of the
table to pitch it? Would you please, Clyde!

07:11.216 --> 07:14.548
Imagine, if you will,
in the sci-fi/fantasy realm...

07:14.549 --> 07:15.815
and now please understand that

07:15.816 --> 07:17.915
I use the genre
to mask its profound

07:17.916 --> 07:19.382
social relevance...

07:19.383 --> 07:21.915
a deeply erotic exploration
of interplanetary love,

07:21.916 --> 07:24.948
a multi-galactic
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>

07:24.949 --> 07:27.548
probing, if you will...
pun intended... the semiotics

07:27.549 --> 07:30.915
of love, sex,
the burden of genius...

07:30.916 --> 07:33.115
- uh, in a dystoptian society. Now,
- Nope.

07:33.116 --> 07:35.282
We open... That's a wrap.
You got a couple words in,

07:35.283 --> 07:36.482
though... that's good for you.
Are you kidding me?

07:36.483 --> 07:37.515
You just said that
I could do it.

07:37.516 --> 07:39.948
You just said "dystopian."
What the fuck is that?

07:39.949 --> 07:41.882
Marty, do you have any of those shit-
encrusted razor blades?

07:41.883 --> 07:43.015
Because I am fuckin' starving.

07:43.016 --> 07:45.215
Okay, well,
I got one right here.

07:45.216 --> 07:46.215
Pop it in my mouth.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.682
There we go.
Oh, it's shit, though.

07:47.683 --> 07:49.215
But I want another.
Got another.

07:49.216 --> 07:50.315
The dedication page says:

07:50.316 --> 07:52.416
"To Doug Guggenheim,
for doing it."

07:55.949 --> 07:57.715
Hey. I left you a message.

07:57.716 --> 07:59.615
What the fuck, Samantha?

07:59.616 --> 08:01.348
I mean... what the fuck?

08:01.349 --> 08:04.648
Jeannie...
No! Goddamn it, I told you about DollaHyde,

08:04.649 --> 08:06.515
but I never sent you
the goddamn books,

08:06.516 --> 08:09.082
and I decided
not to move forward, and...

08:09.083 --> 08:11.348
you f... you fucked me?

08:11.349 --> 08:13.648
Uh, in case you were unaware,
one of the subjects

08:13.649 --> 08:15.748
of this investigation was
murdered since we last spoke.

08:15.749 --> 08:18.882
Yes, I am very well aware,
because I got his fucking brains

08:18.883 --> 08:20.748
Jeannie...
all over my new shoes. Thanks.

08:20.749 --> 08:23.182
You of all people should
understand blind ambition.

08:23.183 --> 08:24.882
But...

08:24.883 --> 08:26.648
I have...

08:26.649 --> 08:29.348
a very good thing...

08:29.349 --> 08:30.748
I had...

08:30.749 --> 08:32.582
a good thing going,
and this is...

08:32.582 --> 08:34.815
Look, Jeannie,
I told you when this came up

08:34.816 --> 08:38.682
it was a rough road to take, and
you said you wanted to take it.

08:38.683 --> 08:41.381
And just so you know,
it'll probably get a lot worse.

08:41.383 --> 08:43.982
I'm gonna try to protect you,
but we shouldn't speak.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.182
There is nothing
It'll compromise this investigation.

08:46.183 --> 08:47.948
To...

08:47.949 --> 08:50.382
Samantha?

08:50.383 --> 08:52.848
Fuck.

08:52.849 --> 08:54.548
Oh, yeah, I hear you, Jimmy.

08:54.549 --> 08:57.248
No, no, no, I hear you,
and if I were you,

08:57.249 --> 08:59.115
I would feel
exactly the same way.

08:59.116 --> 09:01.248
But thankfully, I'm not you,

09:01.249 --> 09:02.648
and I can see
the bigger picture.

09:02.649 --> 09:05.215
Let me paint it for you, 'kay?
In one week,

09:05.216 --> 09:07.148
this thing is a
blip on the radar,

09:07.149 --> 09:10.215
and you, in that panicky way
that you are undoubtedly working

09:10.216 --> 09:13.948
with your therapist on, realize
that you have shit-canned

09:13.949 --> 09:15.815
the best fucking consultants
on the planet,

09:15.816 --> 09:17.715
who will never,
ever take you back

09:17.716 --> 09:19.615
in a <i> million</i> years after your

09:19.616 --> 09:22.215
cowardly act of abandonment.
And then you are left

09:22.216 --> 09:25.582
with that old, so familiar
feeling again, Jimmy: Oh, no,

09:25.583 --> 09:27.415
I fuckin' blew it,

09:27.416 --> 09:28.848
I fuckin' hate myself,

09:28.849 --> 09:30.615
I am a piece of CEO shit

09:30.616 --> 09:33.782
at the far reaches
of the CEO universe!

09:33.783 --> 09:37.948
Or, alternate painting:
You stick with K&A,

09:37.949 --> 09:42.382
and as our loyal client you soar
to the top of the pile,

09:42.383 --> 09:45.415
K&A works harder for you
than ever before,

09:45.416 --> 09:48.782
platforming you into bigger
and better market positions.

09:48.783 --> 09:51.515
Pretty soon, you're making
so much fucking money that,

09:51.516 --> 09:53.382
quite frankly, you're
a little embarrassed, Jimmy.

09:53.383 --> 09:56.282
But your young, sexy wife
is literally doing backflips

09:56.283 --> 09:58.215
on your Cialis-engorged cock.

09:58.216 --> 10:01.782
And... yes, I know,
I've seen the missus...

10:01.783 --> 10:04.582
and your children, oh,
they-they actually worship you

10:04.583 --> 10:06.015
as their godhead.

10:06.016 --> 10:08.248
You want to pick up
that third crib? Get it.

10:08.249 --> 10:11.282
Oh, the yacht with the helipad?
Pick that shit up, too.

10:11.283 --> 10:13.915
Your <i> cojones</i> are the size
of fucking basketballs

10:13.916 --> 10:15.182
and you're a goddamn winner,
Jimmy.

10:15.183 --> 10:17.315
Now you tell me,
which painting do you...?

10:17.316 --> 10:19.416
Oh, you like the second one?
Okay, you're welcome.

10:20.616 --> 10:22.448
Ah!

10:22.449 --> 10:23.848
Ha!
Okay?

10:23.849 --> 10:26.615
Doug, that's what
this is gonna look like

10:26.616 --> 10:27.848
for the next, you know...

10:27.849 --> 10:29.882
Marty, I can't do that.

10:29.883 --> 10:31.915
Doug, you and Clyde
just fucking find out

10:31.916 --> 10:34.715
who brought the hammer down,
okay, and squash this shit.

10:34.716 --> 10:36.748
I need to know
if it's an internal thing.

10:36.749 --> 10:38.248
Jeannie and I are gonna focus

10:38.249 --> 10:39.715
on keeping the clients from
jumping ship.

10:39.716 --> 10:41.948
Should we be taking Will
and his pod off the road?

10:41.949 --> 10:45.248
No, we need to be in Act As If
Mode for the foreseeable future.

10:45.249 --> 10:47.548
Anybody inside
the business asks,

10:47.549 --> 10:48.948
things are great.

10:48.949 --> 10:52.615
Just... fucking...
great.

10:52.616 --> 10:53.848
Great.

10:53.849 --> 10:56.015
Great. Yeah.
Great.

10:56.016 --> 10:58.115
So, what, you don't need
consultants anymore, Blaine?

10:58.116 --> 11:00.815
What are you gonna do,
you gonna go to Kinsley?

11:00.816 --> 11:02.682
Are you kidding me?
That fucking toxic...

11:02.683 --> 11:04.448
You-You gonna go
to the wreckage of Galweather?

11:04.449 --> 11:05.982
No, you're gonna stay with me,

11:05.983 --> 11:08.415
Marty fucking Kaan.
Are you joking?

11:08.416 --> 11:10.015
It's a loyalty issue, Blaine.

11:10.016 --> 11:11.582
You know, back in the day,

11:11.583 --> 11:13.748
everything we did
was because of loyalty.

11:13.749 --> 11:17.082
Yeah. You shit all over
Skip Galweather,

11:17.083 --> 11:20.048
I stayed loyal
as a goddamn spaniel.

11:20.049 --> 11:21.248
You did, you did,

11:21.249 --> 11:22.815
and I was very
appreciative of that.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.815
But this is fucking end of days.

11:24.816 --> 11:27.448
In this environment,
you go with a Marty Kaan

11:27.449 --> 11:29.115
because he's a winner...
That's right.

11:29.116 --> 11:30.315
Not because of loyalty.

11:30.316 --> 11:32.948
So what are you trying to fucking
tell me, Blaine?

11:32.949 --> 11:34.348
Marty...

11:34.349 --> 11:37.015
you're not a winner anymore.

11:37.016 --> 11:38.448
I'm not a winner.

11:38.449 --> 11:39.682
Are you kidding me?

11:39.683 --> 11:42.282
Whoa! A finger?
Really?

11:42.283 --> 11:44.249
That necessary?

11:46.349 --> 11:48.249
Power-walking fuck.

11:49.383 --> 11:52.982
Uh-huh, and how's the baby?

11:52.983 --> 11:57.015
Absolutely, 11 is not at all
a baby... anymore.

11:57.016 --> 12:00.949
Um, but you know,
she'll always be <i> your</i> baby.

12:02.683 --> 12:05.849
He.<i> He</i> will always be
your baby.

12:10.149 --> 12:11.415
Go ahead. So?

12:11.416 --> 12:12.715
So, as I was saying,

12:12.716 --> 12:15.682
Marty, you made a real point of
never confusing

12:15.683 --> 12:17.315
this business relationship
for a friendship.

12:17.316 --> 12:18.848
I mean, there was

12:18.849 --> 12:21.548
a moment there where
we both thought...

12:21.549 --> 12:22.882
New fuckin' bestie, brah.
Yeah.

12:22.883 --> 12:23.782
No, but you wanted

12:23.783 --> 12:25.448
to keep it straight up
bid-ness, homie.

12:25.449 --> 12:27.148
And we respect that.

12:27.149 --> 12:29.115
Much respect.

12:29.116 --> 12:32.882
So in that same spirit, Marty...

12:32.883 --> 12:34.149
Wait for it.

12:35.283 --> 12:37.082
Wait for it.

12:37.083 --> 12:38.782
You're fucking fired.

12:38.783 --> 12:40.015
Dismissed.

12:40.016 --> 12:40.949
Boo!

12:42.383 --> 12:44.348
Are you fucking kidding me?

12:44.349 --> 12:48.216
I'm getting fired by the guys
who brought me vagina perfume?

12:49.916 --> 12:51.715
It's a new low.

12:51.716 --> 12:53.482
New low.
New low.

12:53.483 --> 12:56.748
New low.
New low.

12:56.749 --> 12:58.815
Aw, Marty.

12:58.816 --> 13:02.448
Marty! Do not pass go,
do not collect Dushkin dollars.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.282
Oh, why so serious?

13:04.283 --> 13:06.715
Marty, Marty, we're totally
fucking with you, man. Come on. Yeah.

13:06.716 --> 13:08.882
It's us, it's us. Come on back,
come on back. No, you're still fired!

13:08.883 --> 13:10.983
You're f... Oh!
Oh!

13:13.283 --> 13:15.215
Oh, hey, Dad.

13:15.216 --> 13:17.448
Uh-huh. Where you going?

13:17.449 --> 13:19.748
Just to shoot around.
Hey, Grandpa, come on. Let's go.

13:19.749 --> 13:21.948
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Shoot around? Who's gonna be there?

13:21.949 --> 13:23.748
I don't know.
Whoever's ballin'.

13:23.749 --> 13:25.815
Just whoever?
I don't know.

13:25.816 --> 13:27.548
Maybe Ethan, Coltrane.

13:27.549 --> 13:29.215
Maybe Lex.

13:29.216 --> 13:31.082
Dad, what does it matter?

13:31.083 --> 13:34.048
No, Roscoe.
Are you forgetting the tears,

13:34.049 --> 13:36.082
the mascara all over my shirt?

13:36.083 --> 13:37.615
Dad. Dad. You want to go through that
again? Because this is where

13:37.616 --> 13:39.882
it's headed.
You understand that? Hey.

13:39.883 --> 13:42.215
I-I told him
that he could go.

13:42.216 --> 13:45.282
Look, I-I feel
it's important for him

13:45.283 --> 13:47.215
to work this out for himself.
Oh, you feel?

13:47.216 --> 13:48.983
Can I talk to you
over here for a second?

13:50.849 --> 13:53.382
Pop, I tell him he can't go.

13:53.383 --> 13:55.348
Then you tell him he can go.
Okay, don't you think

13:55.349 --> 13:56.748
that undermines my authority
a little bit?

13:56.749 --> 13:58.182
No, no. You're right.
You're right.

13:58.183 --> 13:59.915
When you're right,
you're right, okay?

13:59.916 --> 14:03.348
But I was just thinking that,
you know, Roscoe <i> and</i> Lex

14:03.349 --> 14:05.815
need to go through this
for themselves.

14:05.816 --> 14:08.115
We can't help 'em with that.
Grandpa,

14:08.116 --> 14:09.848
can we please go now?

14:09.849 --> 14:11.315
You have to ask your father.

14:11.316 --> 14:12.983
Oh.

14:19.083 --> 14:21.048
Yeah, go ahead, man.

14:21.049 --> 14:23.483
Thanks, Dad.

14:30.383 --> 14:31.782
Lex, come on!

14:31.783 --> 14:33.048
What's with you, fat ass?

14:33.049 --> 14:35.183
Go out! Go out! Go out!

14:37.349 --> 14:39.015
Foul for touching.

14:39.016 --> 14:40.148
Ah.

14:40.149 --> 14:42.015
Oh. Ah!

14:42.016 --> 14:44.349
Hey!

14:51.149 --> 14:52.548
I need a screen!
Give me the ball,

14:52.549 --> 14:54.582
give me the ball, give me the ball.
You're not open!

14:54.583 --> 14:55.949
Damn it.

14:57.249 --> 14:59.215
Who's the big dog now, huh?

14:59.216 --> 15:01.115
Hey, Lex, overcompensate much?

15:01.116 --> 15:02.148
Oh, shut up, Ethan.

15:02.149 --> 15:03.848
Ooh, I'm scared.
I said

15:03.849 --> 15:05.348
shut the fuck up!
Hey! Can we just

15:05.349 --> 15:07.015
chill for a second?
We done playing?

15:07.016 --> 15:08.382
I'm definitely done.

15:08.383 --> 15:09.382
Yeah, pussy boy's done.

15:09.383 --> 15:10.482
Relax.

15:10.483 --> 15:12.082
Fuck you.

15:12.083 --> 15:13.815
I think I'm gonna head home.

15:13.816 --> 15:15.149
Wait.

15:16.283 --> 15:18.115
Your turn.

15:18.116 --> 15:20.048
What?
You kiss him.

15:20.049 --> 15:22.615
The hell? No. Get off of me. Kiss him.
You want to. Do it. You've been wanting to

15:22.616 --> 15:24.448
for months now.
Lex, what the fuck?

15:24.449 --> 15:26.848
Just fucking do it!

15:26.849 --> 15:29.715
What? Can't handle the truth
being shoved in your face,

15:29.716 --> 15:33.749
<i>faggot?</i>
Fuck you, Lex!

15:39.916 --> 15:43.615
Sorry, guys.

15:43.616 --> 15:47.616
I'm just fucking with y'all.
Jesus.

15:49.783 --> 15:51.015
I got to go.

15:51.016 --> 15:53.649
Me, too.

16:00.283 --> 16:02.282
Fuck.

16:02.283 --> 16:03.682
It's like, I don't want to be

16:03.683 --> 16:05.248
in your fucking book club,
you know,

16:05.249 --> 16:08.115
and talk about Jonathan Franzen
until I blow my brains out,

16:08.116 --> 16:10.282
but now I can't say that
to her, so...

16:10.283 --> 16:13.315
now I'm in the fucking
book club.

16:13.316 --> 16:14.515
And...

16:14.516 --> 16:17.816
I know.

16:20.183 --> 16:23.215
You know,
this got me through today.

16:23.216 --> 16:25.216
It really did. Thank you.

16:26.383 --> 16:29.282
Me, too, Marty.
I'd close my eyes and...

16:29.283 --> 16:32.582
you know, just thinking
about these past few days

16:32.583 --> 16:35.915
with you

16:35.916 --> 16:39.882
and where we're headed and...

16:39.883 --> 16:42.748
I'd just kind of drift away from
the fucking misery, you know?

16:42.749 --> 16:44.682
It's like I didn't even care

16:44.683 --> 16:46.484
they were carrying the computers
out the door.

16:48.183 --> 16:50.183
I'm really happy to be here
with you.

16:56.649 --> 16:59.315
All this bullshit
that we've been through,

16:59.316 --> 17:03.348
I think... that somehow I knew
that we were gonna wind up...

17:03.349 --> 17:04.615
here,

17:04.616 --> 17:07.415
something real, you know?

17:07.415 --> 17:09.015
It's fucking amazing, right?

17:09.016 --> 17:12.615
It is.

17:12.616 --> 17:14.748
I don't...

17:14.749 --> 17:16.548
Are you all right?

17:16.549 --> 17:17.915
Yeah.

17:17.915 --> 17:21.415
I just keep thinking,
what if this all gets...

17:21.415 --> 17:23.048
I don't know...
goes to hell?

17:23.049 --> 17:24.682
With this investigation thing?

17:24.683 --> 17:26.415
What if they really
blow it wide open?

17:26.415 --> 17:27.948
This amazing company.

17:27.949 --> 17:30.882
It won't. But what if it does?
And what if...

17:30.883 --> 17:34.048
I-it takes the... this...

17:34.049 --> 17:36.683
company and destroys it?

17:39.216 --> 17:40.982
I really...

17:40.983 --> 17:44.149
I r...

17:46.249 --> 17:48.582
Fuck me.

17:48.583 --> 17:50.582
Wow.
Okay.

17:50.583 --> 17:52.982
Well, that was the world's
shortest relationship.

17:52.983 --> 17:54.348
No.

17:54.349 --> 17:56.082
I'm kidding.
No, no.

17:56.083 --> 17:58.149
I... That's not...
Jeannie, I was kidding.

18:02.716 --> 18:05.215
I don't feel good. My stomach...

18:05.216 --> 18:06.748
Oh. D-Do you want to go?

18:06.749 --> 18:09.348
Yeah, probably.

18:09.349 --> 18:11.348
Okay.
Sorry.

18:11.349 --> 18:13.548
It's all right. Excuse me.
Could-could you find our server?

18:13.549 --> 18:15.549
I think we're gonna take off.

18:27.283 --> 18:30.148
Hi. I need to, um...
L-Let me go first, okay?

18:30.149 --> 18:32.215
Uh, at we need is an index

18:32.216 --> 18:34.315
of all our accounts and where we
stand in terms of keeping them.

18:34.316 --> 18:37.482
That's a good idea. Okay, and then
we just build a model that predicts

18:37.483 --> 18:39.782
the statistical likelihood of us
keeping or losing the account.

18:39.783 --> 18:41.682
Then we just put
in the requisite time and effort

18:41.683 --> 18:44.615
based on the outcome. I think that's great.
I-I just need two minutes

18:44.616 --> 18:46.015
of your uninterrupted attention.
Hey.

18:46.016 --> 18:48.082
Hey, guys. Um...
Okay.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.415
We have some info.

18:49.416 --> 18:51.715
Uh, all right.
You say it.

18:51.716 --> 18:55.082
- I... No, I'll say it.
- All right,

18:55.083 --> 18:56.615
you tell the first part...
Will you guys fucking please?

18:56.616 --> 18:57.948
We're in the clear on DollaHyde.

18:57.949 --> 19:00.682
They came in looking for two
sets of books they thought we had

19:00.683 --> 19:02.115
and they found
absolutely nothing.

19:02.116 --> 19:03.348
Right, because we had nothing.

19:03.349 --> 19:04.315
That's great.

19:04.316 --> 19:06.648
But-but, um,
they-they did find

19:06.649 --> 19:08.148
some pretty incriminating paper

19:08.149 --> 19:09.982
on the Colossal Foods
and Free Range deals.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.148
Fuck.

19:11.149 --> 19:12.448
Collusion, conspiracy.

19:12.449 --> 19:14.215
- No.
- Now the CEO of Free Range

19:14.216 --> 19:16.148
wants to see you cooked
in a vegan casserole.

19:16.149 --> 19:18.815
Who the fuck let the Feds in on
this thing in the first place?

19:18.816 --> 19:20.915
I mean, how'd they even know
about the two sets of books?

19:20.916 --> 19:22.415
We have absolutely no idea.
We've been searching. No idea.

19:22.416 --> 19:24.816
Jeannie, what did your friend
at the DOJ say?

19:25.816 --> 19:28.948
Um...

19:28.949 --> 19:31.283
Um...

19:35.249 --> 19:36.948
I told her about the books.

19:36.949 --> 19:38.682
What do you mean you
told her about the books?

19:38.683 --> 19:40.548
I mean I told her.

19:40.549 --> 19:41.548
Wait, what am I missing?

19:41.549 --> 19:42.682
Wh-What's the play? Why?

19:42.683 --> 19:44.282
Because I wanted the DOJ gig,

19:44.283 --> 19:47.048
and I...

19:47.049 --> 19:48.982
offered her the DollaHyde books.

19:48.983 --> 19:50.848
But I never...

19:50.849 --> 19:52.582
After Lukas got killed,

19:52.583 --> 19:56.016
she... she just fucking did it.

20:03.716 --> 20:05.716
Can you guys give us
a minute, please?

20:13.783 --> 20:16.448
I've never been
an honest person, Marty.

20:16.449 --> 20:18.482
It's... I just...

20:18.483 --> 20:20.448
Never seemed like
a viable option.

20:20.449 --> 20:22.716
Me, either.

20:30.549 --> 20:32.948
It's okay.

20:32.949 --> 20:34.382
It's okay.

20:34.383 --> 20:36.416
Please, Marty.

21:04.183 --> 21:06.715
Jeannie, this was not easy,

21:06.716 --> 21:10.083
but you're in the clear.
They're letting you skate.

21:19.116 --> 21:20.596
You have the right
to remain silent...

21:38.683 --> 21:41.348
Call Ben Hyam, all right,
tell him... tell him to meet me

21:41.349 --> 21:42.915
downtown with a bail agreement.

21:42.916 --> 21:44.615
All right, get back to work.

21:44.616 --> 21:46.148
All right, nothing's changed.

21:46.149 --> 21:47.482
Things to do.

21:47.483 --> 21:49.183
Don't talk to the fucking press,
everybody.

22:19.149 --> 22:21.949
Here he comes.

22:30.149 --> 22:32.082
Hey.

22:32.083 --> 22:33.649
Hey.

22:35.383 --> 22:38.015
Uh, thanks, you know.
I appreciate...

22:38.016 --> 22:40.515
Mm. Yeah. Get in.

22:40.516 --> 22:42.715
Okay, uh, usually I sit...

22:42.716 --> 22:45.882
She called shotgun. You want to get in
the car before they change their mind?

22:45.883 --> 22:48.282
Get in the car. We got
to make it to the Valley.

22:48.283 --> 22:51.116
What's in the Valley?
Get in the car.

25:31.016 --> 25:34.448
So...

25:34.449 --> 25:38.415
I, uh, spent a decent amount
of time with my lawyer,

25:38.416 --> 25:40.382
and things are not looking
too good for me.

25:40.383 --> 25:43.915
Everything points to a pretty
aggressive prosecution,

25:43.916 --> 25:47.715
followed by a deadly bankruptcy
of Kaan and Associates

25:47.716 --> 25:51.115
<i>unless I'm effectively removed</i>
<i>from the company.</i>

25:51.116 --> 25:52.848
<i>In all likelihood,</i>

25:52.849 --> 25:54.382
<i>I'm gonna get worked over</i>
<i>pretty good in the courtroom,</i>

25:54.383 --> 25:56.448
<i>but if I want the company</i>
<i>to survive,</i>

25:56.449 --> 25:58.148
I have to be out completely,

25:58.149 --> 25:59.915
not hanging around
on the sidelines

25:59.916 --> 26:02.048
in some advisory capacity,

26:02.049 --> 26:04.216
but gone.

26:22.116 --> 26:24.248
I guess I taught you
well, huh, Jeannie?

26:24.249 --> 26:26.348
You out-Martied Marty Kaan.

26:26.349 --> 26:28.415
Keys to the kingdom are yours.

26:28.416 --> 26:30.316
Marty, I never meant to...

26:32.116 --> 26:35.215
All I wanted... all I <i> want...</i>

26:35.216 --> 26:37.516
Is what?

26:52.221 --> 26:53.489
You.
