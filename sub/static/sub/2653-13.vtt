00:02.670 --> 00:03.808
- Hi there.
- Hey.

00:03.871 --> 00:05.145
I'll be your server for tonight.

00:05.206 --> 00:07.049
My name is Brian,
if you guys need anything.

00:07.108 --> 00:09.054
What's your name
if we don't need anything?

00:09.110 --> 00:10.851
Patricia.

00:10.911 --> 00:12.413
You're quick, Patricia!

00:12.480 --> 00:16.292
Thanks. Our specialty cocktail for tonight
is a basil-infused mojito.

00:16.350 --> 00:19.331
Oh, yum! We'll take three.

00:19.387 --> 00:20.923
No, that's okay. I'm good.

00:20.988 --> 00:25.300
Come on now. Join us for a specialty cocktail
on our specialty evening.

00:25.359 --> 00:26.702
- Three, please.
- Okay.

00:26.761 --> 00:28.399
You don't drink it, someone will.

00:29.830 --> 00:32.834
Well, that Brian sure is a cutie, huh?

00:32.900 --> 00:34.709
I'd kill to have those lips.

00:34.769 --> 00:37.272
I mean on me.
I mean I want his lips on my mouth.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.942
Can't we just cut to the chase?

00:39.006 --> 00:42.078
- He's got great lips.
- No. What are we doing here? What is this about?

00:42.143 --> 00:44.783
Nothing. We wanted to have
a fun night out with our daughter.

00:44.845 --> 00:46.586
Yeah! Just think of us as your friends.

00:46.647 --> 00:48.490
I don't have 45-year-old friends.

00:48.549 --> 00:52.190
Well, you don't have 45-year-old parents
yet either, honey, so calm down.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.927
Haley has no plan
for her future whatsoever.

00:54.989 --> 00:56.491
She's living in our basement...

00:56.557 --> 00:59.538
taking community college classes in,
well, meandering.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.470
So we're gonna take her out.
We'll have some fun.

01:01.529 --> 01:04.873
And then gently ease her into
a friendly conversation about her future.

01:04.932 --> 01:08.209
As opposed to the approach
that we've taken in the past.

01:10.871 --> 01:13.875
Is this what you're gonna do with your life-
sleep late and take a selfie?

01:13.941 --> 01:17.218
Why are you always criticizing me?
Is this really how you want to start the day?

01:17.278 --> 01:18.985
My day started five hours ago.

01:19.046 --> 01:21.048
- I am under a lot of pressure!
- How? How?

01:21.115 --> 01:23.493
You take three classes a week,
and you miss half of them!

01:23.551 --> 01:25.155
The parking is tricky!

01:25.219 --> 01:27.199
Morning, sunshine.
I saved you some lunch.

01:27.254 --> 01:30.701
I get it, okay? I'm lazy! God!

01:37.965 --> 01:39.945
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:40.000 --> 01:41.911
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:41.969 --> 01:43.971
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:44.038 --> 01:46.018
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:46.073 --> 01:47.211
♪ Hey,♪♪

01:49.844 --> 01:51.050
No!

01:52.346 --> 01:53.916
You know what drives me crazy?

01:53.981 --> 01:56.120
Getting these customer satisfaction calls
during dinner.

01:56.183 --> 01:58.185
They change the oil on your car,
they want a love letter.

01:58.252 --> 02:00.789
I know. I'm waiting for a call
from my doctor's office-

02:00.855 --> 02:02.732
"Please rate your prostate exam.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.736
Would you say you were satisfied?"

02:04.792 --> 02:06.237
I hope you weren't.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.136
"I hope you weren't."

02:08.195 --> 02:10.698
That's a good one, Gloria!

02:10.764 --> 02:13.904
Do you know how hard it is to be funny
in a second language, Jay?

02:13.968 --> 02:17.745
Esta hermosa dama es muybuena.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.115
Ay. Darlene, you're learning Spanish?

02:20.174 --> 02:22.484
Yes, Shorty and I
have been taking classes.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.045
- We're getting good.
- Oh, yeah.

02:24.111 --> 02:25.556
¡Es maravilloso!

02:25.613 --> 02:27.354
You said, "That's wonderful," right?

02:27.414 --> 02:28.757
My Italian helps me.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.921
Why the sudden interest in Spanish?

02:30.985 --> 02:33.591
Actually, there's something
we have to tell you. How's this?

02:33.654 --> 02:36.567
- We're moving to Costa Rica!
- Yeah!

02:36.624 --> 02:38.126
- What?
- When?

02:38.192 --> 02:41.036
In a couple of weeks.
The cost of living is so low down there.

02:41.095 --> 02:43.097
We found this beautiful place
on the water.

02:43.164 --> 02:44.973
It's got its own private beach.

02:45.032 --> 02:47.034
Bathing suits are optional.

02:47.101 --> 02:49.103
But encouraged.

02:49.170 --> 02:50.774
Ay. I'm going to miss you guys.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.785
Don't worry about it. I give it three months, tops.
You hate the beach.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.548
And you know how humid it is down there?

02:55.609 --> 02:58.215
I love the steam room at the club.
It's the same thing.

02:58.279 --> 03:01.317
Except I don't have to see you sitting there
like a pile of melted ice cream.

03:01.382 --> 03:02.759
'Cause you're Tom Selleck in a towel.

03:02.816 --> 03:05.296
I'm just ready for an adventure.
I want to try something new.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.491
Stick around here.
Pick up a check every now and then.

03:07.555 --> 03:10.900
Why do you always have to be so negative?
I think it's great.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.666
No, you're right. I'm sorry.
I'm surprised, that's all.

03:13.727 --> 03:17.231
Let's toast this amazing new chapter
of your lives.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.244
To mosquitoes the size of your fist.

03:20.534 --> 03:23.174
This is why
all your friends move away.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.982
To us, alone at last.

03:28.042 --> 03:30.488
We both look very handsome tonight.

03:30.544 --> 03:34.458
You know, if you'd just said that I looked
handsome, I would have said, "So do you."

03:34.515 --> 03:37.621
I couldn't take that chance.
I wanted to get off on the right foot.

03:37.685 --> 03:41.462
Mitchell and I desperately
need a romantic night out to reconnect.

03:41.522 --> 03:43.866
Yeah. I don't know if it's the stress
of planning a wedding...

03:43.924 --> 03:46.427
but we've been a little tense
with each other lately, huh?

03:46.493 --> 03:49.770
- Even our friend J'Marcus said how bitchy we've been.
- When did he say that?

03:49.830 --> 03:52.674
At Pepper's party that night you wore
those pants that don't fit you anymore.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.646
Oh, right. And you brought that bad wine
that everybody hated.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.979
- See? We really need this.
- We really do.

03:58.038 --> 04:01.281
Oh, you know, Pepper said that
for our cake tasting, we needed to have-

04:01.342 --> 04:03.288
Ah, ah, ah, ah. Remember our rules?

04:03.344 --> 04:05.688
No wedding talk, no Lily talk.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.657
- Sorry. No, you're right.
- Hmm?

04:08.782 --> 04:10.455
So, just gonna-

04:14.455 --> 04:18.062
- Should we hear the specials again?
- We can't ask him a third time.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.964
You know what I might try
when I'm down there? Surfing.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.976
So it's gonna be a closed casket?

04:25.032 --> 04:27.376
- My turn.
- What are you talkin' about? I just sunk the three ball.

04:27.434 --> 04:30.005
Then you moved the cue ball
with your stick while you were telling me...

04:30.070 --> 04:32.812
how you were gonna move away
from Southern California to try surfing.

04:32.873 --> 04:35.046
- I didn't touch the cue ball.
- Yeah, I know. But you did.

04:35.109 --> 04:36.713
You're calling me a cheater? You?

04:36.777 --> 04:39.417
The guy on a golf course
who can't seem to count higher than five?

04:39.480 --> 04:42.723
Maybe I can't keep track of my shots
because somebody won't stop talking.

04:42.783 --> 04:46.959
It is in my nature to comment on the bizarre
and unusual things I see in the world...

04:47.021 --> 04:49.160
like that convulsion
you call a golf swing.

04:49.223 --> 04:51.669
- You know what? I'm done here.
- No, I'm done.

04:51.725 --> 04:54.137
I will not have
my integrity questioned here.

04:54.194 --> 04:57.175
I was a marine.
I served with guys who died.

04:57.231 --> 04:59.233
Of old age. You never left the States.

04:59.300 --> 05:00.677
Are you saying
I didn't serve my country?

05:00.734 --> 05:02.111
Which one? America or Costa Rica?

05:02.169 --> 05:04.445
- What's with you and Costa Rica?
- It's a terrible idea!

05:04.505 --> 05:07.349
You get into things without thinking
and you need to be rescued.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.911
Like that time you bought that car
that was supposed to turn into a boat.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.684
- Yeah?
- It turned into a reef!

05:11.745 --> 05:13.986
- That's 'cause you left your door cracked open!
- Yes, it was my fault.

05:14.048 --> 05:17.996
Mark my words. Costa Rica is another
Amphibicar at the bottom of a lake...

05:18.052 --> 05:20.123
only this time,
I won't be bailing you out!

05:20.187 --> 05:23.657
Who asked you? Darlene! We're going!

05:24.725 --> 05:26.466
What do you mean we're going?

05:26.527 --> 05:28.939
Gracias, Gloria.
That was a lovely dinner.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.873
And you are an incredible woman...

05:30.931 --> 05:32.535
for putting up with this gringo!

05:32.599 --> 05:34.078
¡Adiós!

05:34.134 --> 05:35.704
- Come on.
- What happened?

05:35.769 --> 05:38.716
- Good luck in Costa Rica!
- Uh, thanks, Jay.

05:38.772 --> 05:43.187
- He didn't mean it!
- I know. I'm just trying to defuse the tension.

05:49.550 --> 05:50.824
Here we go, guys.

05:50.884 --> 05:53.228
- Oh, yeah!
- Three more mojitos.

05:53.287 --> 05:55.631
Yum! Aren't these yum?

05:55.689 --> 05:57.430
I didn't even drink the first one.

05:57.491 --> 06:00.097
Are you sure?
'Cause I don't think it drank itself.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.662
No, it did not.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.640
Look, I have no problem drinking.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.699
I can literally do it
standing on my head.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.609
But, "A," not with my parents...

06:07.668 --> 06:09.614
and plus, also,
I needed to stay sharp...

06:09.670 --> 06:12.617
because they were obviously
up to something, and I was in no mood.

06:12.673 --> 06:16.018
I barely got 10 hours
of sleep last night.

06:16.076 --> 06:17.521
I'll go get you guys some more water...

06:17.578 --> 06:19.455
and your food should be out
in just a few minutes.

06:19.513 --> 06:21.322
Thanks so much, pal. We appreciate it.

06:21.382 --> 06:23.328
He seems like a real go-getter, huh?

06:23.384 --> 06:25.091
'Cause he goes and gets things?

06:25.152 --> 06:27.154
I wonder what he wants to
do with his life.

06:27.221 --> 06:30.202
- I wonder that about people all the time.
- I think that's very common-

06:30.257 --> 06:33.932
to wonder about
other people's aspirations.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.133
- I do it all the time.
- Yeah, you do. Yeah.

06:36.196 --> 06:37.766
- Here we go.
- Hey, Brian.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.333
You're a young guy.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.380
What do you want to do after this?
What's your plan?

06:41.435 --> 06:43.437
Uh, to be perfectly honest...

06:43.504 --> 06:45.677
I'm probably gonna go home,
watch a movie and get high.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.685
- Oh.
- You guys looking for something to do?

06:47.741 --> 06:49.584
- No. No, no.
- I think I got extra.

06:49.643 --> 06:52.123
- No, that's-
- I think he meant your plan for your life...

06:52.179 --> 06:53.283
not just tonight.

06:53.347 --> 06:55.122
Oh. I want to be a screenwriter.

06:55.182 --> 06:56.684
Ambitious.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.560
And-And so interesting.
Isn't that interesting, Haley?

06:59.620 --> 07:01.327
- Sure.
- You should tell him what you're doing.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.527
You mean after we all
go get high with Brian?

07:03.590 --> 07:05.399
That's not happening.
I'm sorry. I meant-

07:05.459 --> 07:07.666
I know what you meant.
Brian, could you give us a second?

07:07.728 --> 07:08.832
Uh, sure.

07:08.896 --> 07:11.240
So this is what
this whole night's about-

07:11.298 --> 07:13.471
the drinks,
the pretending to be my friend?

07:13.534 --> 07:15.036
We are your friend.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.309
Honey, we care about you.

07:17.371 --> 07:19.942
And we want to make sure
that you've got a plan...

07:20.007 --> 07:21.816
'cause it seems like you're meandering.

07:21.875 --> 07:26.255
No. Sweetie, don't just start texting
because you don't like the conversation.

07:26.313 --> 07:28.259
- Here.
- What is this?

07:28.315 --> 07:30.317
That's a blog that I've been doing.

07:30.384 --> 07:31.886
I'm really liking my photography...

07:31.952 --> 07:34.262
and people always say
that they like the way that I dress...

07:34.321 --> 07:37.268
so I've been posting
pictures of my outfits on this site.

07:37.324 --> 07:39.702
I know it's not
a huge moneymaker right now...

07:39.760 --> 07:43.435
but I do get money whenever someone clicks
on a link and buys something that I wore.

07:43.497 --> 07:45.568
I'm gonna take a business class
next semester...

07:45.632 --> 07:48.545
which I'm hoping will help me
turn all of this into becoming a stylist.

07:48.602 --> 07:51.879
I have 1 ,200 followers. Most are women
who want to know what to wear.

07:51.939 --> 07:54.283
Some are men who want to know
what I'm wearing...

07:54.341 --> 07:57.550
but I'm trying to figure a way
to block all of the pervs.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.557
So, yeah. I guess that is my plan.

08:00.681 --> 08:03.127
- It's amazing.
- We are so proud of you.

08:03.183 --> 08:06.096
Don't even, guys.
You always assume the worst of me.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.497
- Honey.
- No, you guys sit here...

08:08.555 --> 08:11.035
acting like we're drinking buddies,
judging me...

08:11.091 --> 08:14.538
when I have a better handle on my future
than either one of you did at my age.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.370
You? You wanted to be a magician.

08:16.430 --> 08:19.274
And you were changing your major
every three minutes, according to Grandpa...

08:19.333 --> 08:21.677
who, by the way,
has been drinking with me for years...

08:21.735 --> 08:25.148
because he loves me and he thinks
I say funny things when I'm buzzed.

08:28.275 --> 08:31.279
- Mmm.
- Well, apparently, the situation in Syria is worsening.

08:31.345 --> 08:33.825
I know.

08:33.881 --> 08:36.259
In fact, now U. N. evidence
suggests that Assad-

08:36.316 --> 08:38.318
- Are you reading this off your phone?
- What?

08:38.385 --> 08:39.625
- You're-
- No!

08:39.686 --> 08:40.892
- Yeah.
- No!

08:40.953 --> 08:42.900
- I was just making sure my facts were straight-
- Cam?

08:42.956 --> 08:45.493
Before I started a spirited conversation
of current events.

08:45.559 --> 08:47.061
Yeah.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.973
What else does it say?

08:52.032 --> 08:53.477
Oh, thank you.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.946
Mmm. Sorry. Is that the tuna tartare?

08:56.003 --> 08:58.643
- Yes, and it is delicious.
- Should've ordered it.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.207
- Well.
- Would you like a taste?

09:00.274 --> 09:03.016
Oh, no. But thank you.
That's very sweet.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.578
She really means it.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.784
- Katie loves sharing food.
- Me too.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.849
I think it's growing up
in a big family...

09:08.916 --> 09:11.487
'cause everything at suppertime
on the table was up for grabs.

09:11.552 --> 09:14.795
We didn't say grace.
We said, "On your marks, get set, go."

09:14.855 --> 09:18.302
You sound exactly like my dad. He was
from this really big family in Missouri, and-

09:18.358 --> 09:20.736
Shut up! I'm a Missouri farm boy myself!

09:20.794 --> 09:23.331
- Stop!
- Oh, my gosh! I'm Cam.

09:23.397 --> 09:25.343
Well, right pleased to meet you, Cam.

09:25.399 --> 09:28.175
- This is Brandon.
- Hi. She doesn't really talk like that.

09:28.235 --> 09:32.615
Oh, well, he slips in and out of his accent
like Kate Winslet in Titanic

09:32.673 --> 09:34.949
- Uh, I'm Mitchell, by the way.
- Hi.

09:35.008 --> 09:37.784
- Hi.
- What's yours, Brandon? It looks delicious too.

09:37.844 --> 09:40.381
It's the truffle Parmesan gnocchi.

09:40.447 --> 09:42.256
- Ooh!
- You know what though?

09:42.316 --> 09:44.592
If you want a bite of that,
you're barking up the wrong tree.

09:44.651 --> 09:46.722
'Cause that dish
is in a strict no-share zone.

09:46.787 --> 09:49.290
I just-
I don't like people eating off my plate.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.802
Yeah, because you're not an animal.
I'm the same way.

09:51.858 --> 09:53.531
Oh, my gosh! You're exactly us!

09:53.594 --> 09:55.870
No, you guys are more interesting,
'cause you have the whole gay thing.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.205
Katie, you don't know if they're gay.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.211
Okay, that's adorable.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.008
Yeah, it was a pretty safe bet.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.776
Okay. I'm running to the powder room.

10:03.837 --> 10:06.841
Cam, please try the tartare,
because whatever you order, I want a taste.

10:06.907 --> 10:11.583
Okay. Don't you dillydally, because I ain't
exactly slow once I tie on the ol' feed bag!

10:11.645 --> 10:13.420
Calm down, Honey Boo Boo.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.323
- She's so cute!
- Very adorable.

10:15.382 --> 10:17.225
Brandon, what do you do for a living?

10:17.284 --> 10:21.255
Look, guys, I hate to be blunt,
but could you please give us some space?

10:23.056 --> 10:25.832
- Not a problem.
- Look, no, it's-

10:25.892 --> 10:27.565
I mean, you guys are great...

10:27.628 --> 10:30.199
but I'm gonna propose
to Katie tonight...

10:30.263 --> 10:32.766
- and I'm kind of feeling-
- What? Here?

10:32.833 --> 10:34.335
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God! That's amazing!

10:34.401 --> 10:36.677
We just got engaged a few months ago.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.944
- Very good.
- Yeah, so we will definitely give you your privacy.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.349
- Absolutely.
- Congratulations.

10:40.407 --> 10:41.545
Good luck.

10:41.608 --> 10:43.815
If you wanted,
I could pretend like I'm texting...

10:43.877 --> 10:46.380
and I could video
the whole thing on my phone.

10:46.446 --> 10:49.723
- That way you'd have it forever.
- Really? That would be awesome.

10:49.783 --> 10:54.630
Are you sure? He gets very, uh, excited,
and he might give it away.

10:54.688 --> 10:59.034
Mitchell, um, I think I know Katie
well enough to tell if she's getting suspicious.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.472
- Cam.
- She said I could.

11:03.530 --> 11:05.771
Where the hell's the corkscrew?

11:07.467 --> 11:09.970
- Do you want to talk about it?
- There's nothing to talk about.

11:10.037 --> 11:12.039
Shorty does dumb things all the time.

11:12.105 --> 11:16.281
You mark my words. In three months,
he'll be back here needing money.

11:16.343 --> 11:20.485
Maybe this is not about Shorty coming back.
Maybe this is about Shorty not coming back.

11:20.547 --> 11:22.322
- Manny.
- What she's saying is...

11:22.382 --> 11:25.056
deep down, you're afraid
Shorty's going to love Costa Rica...

11:25.118 --> 11:26.961
and you'll lose
your best friend forever.

11:27.020 --> 11:31.025
That's what you do. You push people away,
so when they leave, it doesn't hurt that much.

11:31.091 --> 11:34.664
I don't get it. You're the greatest generation,
but why can't you feel?

11:34.728 --> 11:37.834
Why can't you spend your teen years
locked in your bedroom like a normal kid?

11:37.898 --> 11:39.900
See? Now he's doing it to me.

11:39.966 --> 11:43.812
You have to face it, Jay.
One day, I'll be moving out of this house.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.474
Can I get that in writing?

11:45.539 --> 11:47.712
'Cause I can't shake this image
of a 30-year-old you...

11:47.774 --> 11:49.481
eating my food
and cuddling with my wife.

11:49.543 --> 11:52.683
- Boys should never stop cuddling their mothers.
- I'm gonna have nightmares!

11:52.746 --> 11:55.955
You pretend to be so tough.
But you know what I think?

11:56.016 --> 12:00.294
I think that deep down,
you're the most sensitive person in this house.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.060
Hmm. See?

12:02.122 --> 12:03.658
You did it again.

12:03.724 --> 12:05.795
I say something that strikes a nerve...

12:05.859 --> 12:07.861
and immediately you cannot handle it.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.930
That's why you-
in my face!

12:09.996 --> 12:12.203
We just found the one thing
you can't make sexy.

12:12.265 --> 12:13.801
There it is again.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.245
- I need a drink.
- Jay.

12:16.303 --> 12:18.374
You have to make this right with Shorty.

12:18.438 --> 12:21.385
You have to tell him how you feel!

12:21.441 --> 12:24.888
He has been a great compadre
with you for many years.

12:24.945 --> 12:27.357
Besides, who else is going
to laugh at your jokes?

12:27.414 --> 12:29.291
Lots of people laugh at my jokes.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.795
- Name one person that doesn't work for you.
- You know what?

12:31.852 --> 12:33.661
Why don't you two just go cuddle?

12:35.055 --> 12:36.693
- Okay, here she comes.
- Stay calm.

12:36.757 --> 12:38.964
- You're gonna spoil it.
- Ooh, that looks good.

12:39.025 --> 12:41.767
- What is it?
- Um, this is the grilled calamari.

12:41.828 --> 12:44.001
It's scrumptious.
Would you care for a ring?

12:44.064 --> 12:46.237
Um, I mean, dig in there, girlfriend!

12:46.299 --> 12:48.575
Oh, no, that's okay. Thank you.

12:48.635 --> 12:50.080
This looks so delicious.

12:50.137 --> 12:52.083
Yeah, mine's delicious too.

12:52.139 --> 12:54.415
Katie...

12:54.474 --> 12:56.249
you look so beautiful tonight.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.016
Aw.

12:58.078 --> 13:03.289
You know, I-I've never met anyone like you,
and I know that I never will, and I-

13:03.350 --> 13:04.852
I love you so much.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.459
Will you make me...

13:07.521 --> 13:10.525
the happiest man on earth
and be my bride?

13:10.590 --> 13:11.694
What?

13:11.758 --> 13:14.204
Oh, my God!

13:14.261 --> 13:16.138
- No!
- No?

13:16.196 --> 13:18.142
No!

13:18.198 --> 13:19.268
I'm sorry.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.073
Did you know this place
used to be a bank?

13:21.134 --> 13:24.172
- Was it really?
- Just- I don't want to be married, Brandon.

13:24.237 --> 13:27.446
We'll end up like one of those couples
that sits there with nothing to talk about...

13:27.507 --> 13:30.113
until we glom on to other people.

13:30.177 --> 13:33.351
I can't believe this.
You- You don't love me?

13:33.413 --> 13:34.915
- No!
- No?

13:34.981 --> 13:36.756
- I'm sor-
- No!

13:36.817 --> 13:38.694
I need some air.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.694
- So, Syria. Any updates?
- No, nothing yet.

13:44.758 --> 13:46.260
Nothing.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.642
Do you remember how cute she was...

13:52.699 --> 13:54.736
when she was little
and she couldn't say her P's?

13:54.801 --> 13:56.974
- "Bakeatatoes."
- "Bakeatatoes."

13:57.037 --> 13:59.039
- And "attlesauce."
- "Attlesauce"!

13:59.105 --> 14:00.607
"Can I have attlesauce?"

14:00.674 --> 14:02.347
First of all, you're screaming.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.082
Can we just get the check, please?

14:04.144 --> 14:06.522
Could you please
not be mad at us anymore?

14:06.580 --> 14:10.289
We are very sorry
that you felt manipulated.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.523
- You know what I'm pretty sure is ironic?
- Mm-mmm.

14:12.586 --> 14:15.294
You guys spend all this time
worrying about what I'm going to do...

14:15.355 --> 14:18.666
and maybe you should start thinking
about what you're going to do.

14:18.725 --> 14:20.671
What are you talking about?

14:20.727 --> 14:24.504
Well, what are you gonna do
when we're gone? What's your plan?

14:24.564 --> 14:26.202
Uh, to be fine.

14:26.266 --> 14:27.768
- Yeah.
- 'Cause we're fine.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.745
Totally.
You guys are gone.

14:29.803 --> 14:31.544
We get an R.V. Bam!

14:31.605 --> 14:35.485
Me, Mama and our dog, Merlin,
hit the open road.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.783
No, I am not spending my golden years...

14:37.844 --> 14:41.621
driving around an R.V. park,
looking for a place to plug my house in.

14:41.681 --> 14:43.922
No. I am gonna go see the world.

14:43.984 --> 14:46.726
- Where do you wanna go?
- I don't know, Phil.

14:46.786 --> 14:49.266
- India. Africa.
- Diarrhea. Diarrhea.

14:49.322 --> 14:53.270
Wow. it sounds like you guys
really need to start thinking about your future.

14:53.326 --> 14:56.796
- Are you just gonna put Merlin in a kennel when we're gone?
- Okay, Merlin doesn't exist.

14:56.863 --> 15:00.538
And why do you want to get a dog
to take care of so soon after the kids leave?

15:00.600 --> 15:02.637
Well, I'm gonna need
someone to love me, Claire.

15:02.702 --> 15:05.649
And in the meantime, Mom,
Grandpa wants you to take over the business...

15:05.705 --> 15:08.185
but... do you want that?

15:08.241 --> 15:11.814
I-i guess I hadn't thought
this far into the future.

15:11.878 --> 15:14.222
And, Dad, are you just
gonna keep selling houses?

15:14.281 --> 15:18.696
I mean, I don't want to blow your mind here,
but you could still be a magician.

15:18.752 --> 15:19.822
- I could.
- No.

15:19.886 --> 15:21.593
- He couldn't.
- Really?

15:21.655 --> 15:25.501
- Mm-mmm.
- The salt shaker behind your head says different.

15:25.558 --> 15:28.038
Oh, Phil, you're getting salt all over me!

15:28.094 --> 15:29.903
- I feel like a margarita.
- You got it.

15:29.963 --> 15:32.466
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Just the check, please.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.739
- Okay.
- Thank you so much.

15:34.801 --> 15:36.405
- Thanks, buddy.
- Yeah.

15:36.469 --> 15:39.973
Oh, no. I left my wallet
in the other coat.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.042
I did not bring my purse.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.484
It's fine, guys. I got this.

15:45.545 --> 15:48.321
- Honey, thank you.
- Oh. Thank you, sweetie.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.759
- I should probably drive too, huh?
- Probably.

15:50.817 --> 15:52.194
- I g- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:52.252 --> 15:54.254
Why don't you guys
have the valet pull the car up...

15:54.321 --> 15:55.800
while I pay the check?

15:55.855 --> 15:57.892
That we can do.

16:02.862 --> 16:04.364
You guys, it's that way.

16:04.431 --> 16:05.671
- Mm-hmm.
- It is.

16:05.732 --> 16:07.734
Oh. Um-

16:13.106 --> 16:15.382
You know, for the record,
we do have a lot to talk about.

16:15.442 --> 16:19.413
Yeah, we took a couple of topics off the table
because we wanted to have a romantic date night.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.323
And it probably
put too much pressure on it to be special...

16:22.382 --> 16:26.262
but the truth is, every day I spend
with this man is special.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.821
Oh, Cam!

16:27.887 --> 16:30.026
Oh, no, I'm the lucky one.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.569
There we are.

16:31.624 --> 16:35.333
I'm sorry. I guess I just panicked
when Brandon asked me.

16:35.395 --> 16:40.242
We're so different, and I know it seems petty,
but it speaks to something bigger.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.302
I don't know if I can spend
the rest of my life...

16:42.369 --> 16:44.542
with the kind of guy
who won't let me eat off his plate.

16:44.604 --> 16:48.381
- Trust me. it can be done.
- And I should not make such a big deal about that.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.512
- I promise I'll try and do better.
- No, you're right.

16:50.577 --> 16:53.786
- You don't like it, and I should respect that more.
- Are you guys married?

16:53.847 --> 16:57.294
Oh, this May. But, basically,
we've been married for years.

16:57.350 --> 17:00.263
- Yeah.
- And is Cam everything that I dreamed of?

17:00.320 --> 17:03.494
- Tread lightly, counselor.
- Yes. Yes, he is.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.433
Because through all the compromises...

17:05.492 --> 17:08.803
and negotiations and arguments
and sometimes even boredom...

17:08.862 --> 17:11.468
I cannot picture my life without him.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.943
That's very sweet.
I would've scooted past the boredom, but-

17:14.000 --> 17:18.449
At the end of the day, you have to ask yourself,
can you imagine your life without this person?

17:18.505 --> 17:20.280
Huh.

17:20.339 --> 17:23.116
Hey. All right, look.
I paid the check, okay?

17:23.175 --> 17:25.178
- Let's just go.
- Can you just please sit?

17:25.244 --> 17:29.193
I've been talking to the guys here,
and they've really opened my eyes.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.251
- They did?
- Yes.

17:31.317 --> 17:36.266
I've been trying to picture my life
without you, and... you know what?

17:37.257 --> 17:38.668
I can.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.001
- We didn't tell her that.
- I didn't say that.

17:41.061 --> 17:44.304
No, I want what you guys have, okay?
I'm sorry, Brandon.

17:44.364 --> 17:47.277
I am so sorry,
but we both deserve that.

17:47.333 --> 17:49.609
I've never been so sure of anything.

17:50.870 --> 17:54.215
You know what?
I'm just gonna go get a cab, okay?

17:54.274 --> 17:56.550
Good-bye. And thank you.

17:56.609 --> 18:00.022
- Don't-Don't thank us!
- We didn't do anything, so- We didn't. Honestly.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.855
This is the worst night of my life.

18:01.915 --> 18:05.795
I'm sorry. But, I mean,
um, at least now it's over.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.854
You can... start to move on.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.026
I've been trying
to picture...

18:10.090 --> 18:13.230
my life without you
and.. you know what?

18:13.293 --> 18:14.897
- Stupid phone.
- I can.

18:14.961 --> 18:16.167
It's a...

18:16.229 --> 18:17.970
devil phone.

18:20.967 --> 18:23.914
When Mitchell was born,
he was a month premature...

18:23.970 --> 18:26.644
so it was touch and go there
for a while.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.208
It's 2:00 a.m.

18:28.274 --> 18:31.278
I walk out into the hospital
waiting room to get some air...

18:31.344 --> 18:33.119
and there's Shorty.

18:33.179 --> 18:37.924
He'd been sitting there for six hours
and refused to leave for the next two days.

18:37.984 --> 18:39.930
That's where we got
Mitchell's middle name.

18:39.986 --> 18:42.933
Not Shorty. Vincent.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.491
M.V. P.

18:45.658 --> 18:48.104
We were a little premature
on that one too.

18:49.996 --> 18:52.272
Gloria, I'm going for a drive.

18:52.332 --> 18:55.108
- Say hi to Shorty for me.
- I'm not talking to you.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.614
Hey.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.380
I was just coming to see you.

19:02.442 --> 19:05.218
- Um, I left my jacket.
- Oh!

19:05.278 --> 19:07.280
There it is. Come on in.

19:12.118 --> 19:14.860
- Shorty, you know that stuff I said, uh-
- Yeah, I get it.

19:14.921 --> 19:17.026
- We're good, huh?
- Under the bridge.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.829
- All right. I'll see you.
- Shorty, wait.

19:22.795 --> 19:25.742
- I need to say something to you.
- Yeah.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.800
I want to thank you...

19:28.801 --> 19:30.712
for all the great times we've had.

19:30.770 --> 19:34.081
Yeah. We, um-

19:34.140 --> 19:36.086
- We had a lot of laughs.
- Yeah.

19:36.142 --> 19:38.281
And you should know that, uh...

19:39.379 --> 19:41.381
you're my best friend.

19:41.447 --> 19:44.951
You know? Probably the best friend
I'm ever gonna have.

19:45.018 --> 19:47.259
Jay, I, uh- What are you doing to me?

19:47.320 --> 19:49.322
This is hard for me. I'm just-

19:49.389 --> 19:51.767
I'm just trying to tell you how I feel.

19:51.824 --> 19:54.634
Well, I'm gonna tell you how I feel.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.334
I admire the hell out of you, Jay.

19:57.397 --> 20:00.435
I always tell Darlene,
"That's a real guy."

20:00.500 --> 20:02.605
Self-made, stand-up.

20:02.669 --> 20:05.809
- The kind of guy you want to be in a foxhole with.
- I'm not all that.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.648
Well, it's not like
I've been in a foxhole.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.347
I'm gonna miss you, Vincent.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.859
I'm gonna miss you too.

20:15.915 --> 20:18.122
I love you.

20:18.184 --> 20:20.323
I love you too, Jaybird.

20:20.386 --> 20:23.333
I really, really do.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.633
You call me, okay?

20:27.694 --> 20:29.640
Every day!

20:29.696 --> 20:32.108
Every damn day!

20:32.165 --> 20:36.272
I'm being honest.
This is a little girlier than I thought.

20:36.336 --> 20:38.043
Ugh.

20:42.108 --> 20:44.054
Two years.

20:44.110 --> 20:45.714
How could she just walk away?

20:45.778 --> 20:47.780
- You know what? She did you a favor.
- Absolutely.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.349
- You can do so much better.
- Oh, my God.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.361
- Insanely better.
- No, he's not kidding.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.863
Brandon, you are seriously gorge!

20:53.920 --> 20:55.957
If you ask me,
she got the better end of the deal.

20:56.022 --> 20:57.695
- You really think so?
- Yes!

20:57.757 --> 20:59.498
- Yes!
- And her whole fake blonde thing?

20:59.559 --> 21:02.631
- It was kind of trampy.
- And truth be told, she didn't seem that bright.

21:02.695 --> 21:05.369
Is she older than you?
She looked significantly older than you.

21:05.431 --> 21:07.377
Trust us. This is the-

21:07.433 --> 21:09.242
best thing
that's ever happened to you.

21:09.302 --> 21:11.248
Oh! Thank God you're still here!

21:11.304 --> 21:13.716
I was on my way home,
and all of a sudden, I started crying.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.253
And I realized I was just scared,
and I love you...

21:16.309 --> 21:18.118
and I'm so, so sorry.

21:18.177 --> 21:22.557
And, yes, Brandon,
if you'll still have me, yes, I will marry you!

21:24.083 --> 21:25.687
- Okay. Well, good luck.
- So nice meeting you.

21:25.752 --> 21:27.254
- Yeah, take care.
- Okay.
