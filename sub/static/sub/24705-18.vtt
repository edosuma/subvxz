NICKY: Come on. Don't push me.
I'm going into major back spasms.

00:23.662 --> 00:25.073
Pain's shooting down.

00:25.246 --> 00:29.624
Shouldn't have jumped through that
transom. It's hard on the sciatic.

00:29.793 --> 00:34.918
NICKY: Don't take the bag off my head.
- We're at the station. You're safe.

00:35.089 --> 00:39.964
NICKY: I'm safe? Oh, that's a good one.
That's rich. I'm a dead man.

00:40.136 --> 00:44.547
This is the escaped material witness.
I need aspirin for his back.

00:44.723 --> 00:46.182
NICKY:
Tylenol 3!

00:46.349 --> 00:50.928
- DA's detectives will pick him up.
- Hope you gave them directions.

00:51.146 --> 00:52.937
Up the stairs, Nick. Up.

00:53.105 --> 00:55.941
NICKY: That bitch Kimmy gave me up,
didn't she?

00:56.108 --> 00:59.026
- I don't know.
NICKY: Yeah, tell me another one.

00:59.194 --> 01:03.322
She gave me up. You send me
to my death, making me testify.

01:03.490 --> 01:07.820
You play the Elephant Man?
Say this with your nose all clogged:

01:07.995 --> 01:11.411
I'm not an animal,
I'm a human being.

01:12.624 --> 01:17.202
Why don't you just shoot me
in the head? Come on, right now.

01:17.378 --> 01:21.422
No? Okay, how about the mouth then?
Right through the brain.

01:21.590 --> 01:27.261
That way, I know when it's coming.
Not knowing when it's coming scares me.

01:27.429 --> 01:32.055
That's it, Nicky, keep working
yourself up. Try for a heart attack.

01:32.308 --> 01:36.388
The Olivas are in custody, Nick.
They cannot hurt you.

01:37.271 --> 01:40.722
So are you trying to insult me now?
Is that it?

01:40.899 --> 01:43.734
They can't get to me?
Who are you kidding?

01:43.902 --> 01:46.856
You called it in,
seeing them do that whack.

01:47.031 --> 01:51.276
I was pissed off. You don't
kill a guy in front of his kid.

01:51.451 --> 01:56.825
- They did it in front of the guy's kid.
- You did the right thing calling it in.

01:56.997 --> 02:01.824
And I called it in anonymous.
That word is not in your vocabulary?

02:02.002 --> 02:07.162
You want anonymous, don't use your own
phone. We trace incoming calls here.

02:07.340 --> 02:10.210
So I do a good thing,
I have to die for it.

02:10.384 --> 02:14.962
You're not gonna die.
You're gonna testify, and that is it.

02:16.056 --> 02:18.594
I don't believe a word out of you.

02:18.766 --> 02:24.307
lD the man. Pick him out of a lineup.
You don't gotta go to the grand jury.

02:24.481 --> 02:28.181
I come in, I make the lD.
Two days later, boom!

02:28.359 --> 02:33.815
"Our other evidence fell out. You gotta
testify." When I wouldn't do that...

02:33.989 --> 02:38.069
...you make me a material witness
and throw me in a civil jail.

02:38.243 --> 02:42.490
And that was really cute.
That was nice. You know?

02:42.665 --> 02:46.115
- In there with the animals.
- We put you in a motel.

02:46.292 --> 02:50.124
It's protective custody.
We put you there to protect you.

02:50.296 --> 02:53.332
But deep thinker that you are,
you escape.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.665
Of course I escaped!

02:55.843 --> 02:58.214
I have this thought, you know...

02:58.386 --> 03:04.175
...that maybe my life
is still worth something, you know?

03:04.810 --> 03:07.514
I could still do something
with my life.

03:08.771 --> 03:11.974
I mean, fellas, come on now...

03:12.149 --> 03:18.898
...if I stay in this town and I testify,
I'm a dead man.

03:20.073 --> 03:23.358
Look me in the eye
and tell me that ain't true.

03:23.576 --> 03:28.037
Nicky, if you stop acting like a flake,
that won't be true.

03:29.999 --> 03:35.419
Yeah. Yeah, sure. And Rose Kennedy
shouldn't keep a black dress pressed.

03:35.629 --> 03:37.004
Screw you guys.

Zeppo Marks Brothers

04:50.239 --> 04:54.485
Hey, he's got a bad back.
You might want to be aware of it.

04:54.659 --> 05:00.413
Hey, guys, here's a little tip. We try
to alternate the guys who are asleep.

05:00.582 --> 05:04.875
We try not to have both cops asleep
in a room at the same time.

05:05.044 --> 05:10.204
That way, the guy can't vault
over your shoulders out the transom.

05:10.466 --> 05:12.956
That's not the way it happened.

05:13.134 --> 05:14.214
NICKY:
Okay, okay.

05:14.386 --> 05:17.091
KELLY: He has 48 hours
before he has to testify.

05:17.264 --> 05:20.597
If we could keep him in custody,
that'd be ideal.

05:20.767 --> 05:24.846
NICKY: You tell Kimmy I hope she
got well, ratting me out to you.

05:25.021 --> 05:26.479
You'll be all right.

05:26.647 --> 05:30.311
Deep down,
don't you feel pretty good about this?

05:30.483 --> 05:34.066
NICKY: Whatever happens to me
is on your heads, you pricks.

05:34.237 --> 05:35.696
Oh! My back.

05:38.491 --> 05:43.152
It's probably the only good thing
he's ever done, and it jams him up.

05:43.329 --> 05:45.998
Not like he had much
of a life to ruin.

05:46.164 --> 05:49.864
Better get your uniforms in shape.
Uniform detail soon.

05:50.043 --> 05:52.499
- You're kidding.
- Commander's request.

05:52.671 --> 05:54.046
What's the detail?

05:54.255 --> 06:00.258
<i>Broadway on Broadway.  People from the
musical performing songs on the street.</i>

06:00.428 --> 06:03.262
We're gonna be hip- deep in leotards.

06:05.266 --> 06:08.634
It's the division commander
busting Fancy's balls.

06:08.810 --> 06:12.939
I gotta see Roberts for breakfast.
He didn't sound too good.

06:13.106 --> 06:16.605
- How's that your problem?
- I don't know. See you later.

06:16.818 --> 06:18.228
I'm calling the dry cleaner.

06:18.444 --> 06:21.148
Does your uniform need
any alterations?

06:21.697 --> 06:23.736
What's that supposed to mean?

06:24.533 --> 06:27.071
No. All I'm saying is, you know...

06:27.243 --> 06:33.993
...if it was necessary, my dry cleaner
does alterations, is all I meant.

06:36.252 --> 06:37.627
Excuse me.

- Hi, Mike.
- Hey.

06:59.481 --> 07:02.186
- Nice to see you.
- Yeah, you too. Thanks for meeting me.

07:02.359 --> 07:03.818
KELLY:
Sure.

07:04.485 --> 07:07.107
- How you been?
- I've been better, John.

07:07.280 --> 07:08.775
What's going on?

07:08.949 --> 07:13.278
Well, you know, Connie's
got me sleeping on the couch.

07:13.453 --> 07:17.865
She wants a divorce,
only we can't afford one.

07:18.624 --> 07:20.497
She can't forgive me, John.

07:20.668 --> 07:24.036
That stuff with Dee Dee,
she can't get past it.

07:24.212 --> 07:27.878
- Give her some time, Mike.
- It's not gonna happen.

07:28.049 --> 07:31.881
She looks over at me sometimes,
to get a glass of water...

07:32.053 --> 07:36.679
...I'm on the couch like a dog.
She looks at me with no respect.

07:36.891 --> 07:39.761
My kids used to ask me
how the day went.

07:39.935 --> 07:44.263
Now they ask me,"You seen anything
on TV? Anything good on TV?"

07:44.439 --> 07:49.397
I had decorations, John. I had two
separate citations for valor, right?

07:53.739 --> 07:59.029
Enough bitching and moaning from me.
You got enough problems of your own.

08:00.328 --> 08:03.828
I wanted to tell you,
I took out a Pl license.

08:03.999 --> 08:06.288

- Yeah.

...bodyguarding for Jimmy Wexler,
maybe you have work for me.

08:15.426 --> 08:18.343
He's been so sick,
I'm not working for him.

08:18.512 --> 08:21.513
No kidding, huh? Oh.
I'm sorry he's so sick.

08:21.681 --> 08:25.382
I will think of you
if I get that kind of work. Okay?

08:25.602 --> 08:28.686
- Yeah, I'd appreciate that.
- Okay.

08:29.690 --> 08:32.808
You thought I was an okay cop,
right, John?

08:33.775 --> 08:39.279
I know I crossed the line that one time,
my relationship with Dee Dee...

08:39.448 --> 08:42.482
...but in general,
you respected me as a cop?

08:42.658 --> 08:45.032
In general, Mike, I did.

08:48.039 --> 08:50.197
You know what,
hold on to a few dollars, will you?

08:50.416 --> 08:54.080
Absolutely not. Put that away.

I'm not looking to glom on to anybody.

How did this happen?

10:03.817 --> 10:07.896
Nicky jumped out while they
were taking him to the motel.

10:08.070 --> 10:11.652
He got lost.
I guess his back spasms let up, huh?

10:11.823 --> 10:13.317
KELLY:
Why didn't we hear?

10:13.491 --> 10:17.405
DA cops never called.
They looked for him themselves.

10:17.579 --> 10:21.826
He ran around loose for an hour.
They shot him 20 minutes ago.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.285
KELLY: What have you got?
- No witnesses to the shooting.

10:25.461 --> 10:29.541
That guy saw a blue Pontiac
driving away and a girl running.

- White, late 20s, blond hair.

- I saw her with him.

No, she met him.
He'd been in here, hitting it good.

She came in. She made a phone call.
I think they had a drink.

- They leave. He gets shot out front.
- How come you remember the phone call?

they slaughtered him.

15:38.496 --> 15:41.912
- That's not it.
- DA squad detectives had him.

15:42.084 --> 15:46.377
I don't give a damn. He was your
witness, you were responsible.

15:46.546 --> 15:50.210
The girlfriend saw him get hit.
She can lD the guy.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.754
But she's not gonna open her mouth...

15:52.927 --> 15:56.460
...unless there's money
for her to get out of town.

15:57.388 --> 15:59.761
- How much?
- $3000.

16:00.226 --> 16:02.052
And she'd have to lD him?

16:02.227 --> 16:07.517
Either we pop this guy or the
Olivas walk away, and we all look bad.

16:10.692 --> 16:12.519
I'll get you $2000.

16:14.863 --> 16:16.820
Is that the best you can do?

16:16.990 --> 16:19.529
What are you, working off commission?

16:23.413 --> 16:24.955
Twenty five hundred.

16:25.289 --> 16:29.832
If you bring this guy in off her lD,
and he won't flip on them...

16:30.002 --> 16:33.038
...I don't care what promises
you made this girl...

16:33.213 --> 16:37.791
...it's understood between us
she's gonna testify.

16:38.260 --> 16:39.635
Okay.

16:46.308 --> 16:47.933
You wanna thank him
for the uniform detail?

16:48.102 --> 16:49.216
KELLY:
Yeah.

16:49.395 --> 16:53.605
Listen to this. Ready?
The dry cleaners can't find my uniform.

16:53.774 --> 16:57.985
- They're having trouble tracking it.
- You got the claim ticket?

16:58.154 --> 17:02.861
I lost it. It's three years, they
should have it. They're required.

17:03.032 --> 17:07.326
- I'd go arrest them, Medavoy.
- I may have to buy a new uniform.

17:10.830 --> 17:13.784
I don't wanna wind up a liar
with this girl.

17:13.959 --> 17:18.538
I keep a promise to a witness
once a year, to remember the feeling.

17:18.714 --> 17:22.082
- Let's start on photographs.
- Want to handle that?

17:22.258 --> 17:25.294
KELLY: What's up?
- I want to talk to that bartender again.

17:25.470 --> 17:27.509
All right. I'll see you later.

17:27.846 --> 17:29.044
- Hey.
LAURA: Can I talk to you?

17:29.222 --> 17:32.638
KELLY: Sure. Get her started
on the photographs, please.

17:32.809 --> 17:35.561
- Sure, no problem.
- What's going on?

17:35.729 --> 17:38.599
My trial calendar
had a hole put in it.

17:38.774 --> 17:43.684
The Oliva prosecution's in trouble
now because of Constantino's death.

17:43.861 --> 17:45.900
What did you wanna talk about?

17:46.072 --> 17:50.733
Maybe I'm crazy, but I've had the
feeling that I'm being followed.

17:51.702 --> 17:55.070
- Tell me about it.
- Well, it's nothing concrete.

17:55.247 --> 17:59.161
Three times over the last week.
It's more like a feeling.

17:59.334 --> 18:02.916
I come out of a place,
I feel someone watching me...

18:03.087 --> 18:06.704
...and I turn around,
it's just people on the street.

18:06.882 --> 18:10.879
Probably some post- stress syndrome
from the Giardella thing.

18:11.052 --> 18:14.089
- I wanna look into this.
- What'll you do?

18:14.264 --> 18:17.218
I'll call your super
and send a sector car.

18:17.392 --> 18:19.633
Okay, yeah. Thanks.

18:21.062 --> 18:23.469
- Hey, Laurie.
- Yeah.

18:25.190 --> 18:28.973
The guy you're seeing,
does he have this feeling too?

18:29.152 --> 18:33.648
- What does he have to do with this?
- You're spending lots of hours together.

18:33.865 --> 18:34.896
Yeah?

18:35.074 --> 18:39.535
- Well, does he feel this way too?
- No, he doesn't. Anything else?

18:39.703 --> 18:42.159
I'll send a car.
You gonna be around?

18:42.331 --> 18:45.166
You wanna know where I'm sleeping?

18:47.794 --> 18:50.166
I won't get into your private life...

18:50.380 --> 18:53.879
...but to check this out,
I need to know where you are.

18:54.050 --> 18:57.419
- I sleep at his place half the time.
- In Manhattan?

18:57.595 --> 19:02.091
Yeah. I finally made it
over the bridge.

19:03.767 --> 19:06.637
Here's his name and number.

19:07.979 --> 19:10.305
- Anything else?
- No, that's it.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.854
- Okay, thank you.
- Yeah.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.643
MARTINEZ: You okay?
- Yeah.

19:35.880 --> 19:37.789
BARTENDER:
What's up?

19:38.800 --> 19:41.717
- You remember me, right?
- Yeah.

19:42.511 --> 19:47.385
- I'm following up on the shooting.
- I don't know what else I can tell you.

19:47.557 --> 19:49.135
I'll ask questions.

19:49.309 --> 19:52.226
That'll give you a hint about
what I'm interested in finding out.

19:52.395 --> 19:54.187
BARTENDER:
Sure.

19:54.606 --> 19:59.895
So this girl comes in and meets Nicky.
Let's go over this next part again.

20:00.069 --> 20:04.446
Okay, she made a phone call,
they had a drink, they left.

20:05.031 --> 20:08.400
- He was paying for his drinks, right?
- Yeah.

20:08.577 --> 20:12.277
And she broke a 20 with you
so she could make the call?

20:12.497 --> 20:14.288
Yeah, that's right.

20:14.457 --> 20:19.912
That's how you remember her making the
call, because she asked for change?

20:20.087 --> 20:22.209
Yeah, we talked about all this.

20:22.381 --> 20:27.587
So Nicky's paying for his drinks,
he's got money on the bar...

20:27.761 --> 20:32.386
...and she goes into her pocket
and asks for change for a $20 bill.

20:32.557 --> 20:34.846
That doesn't make sense to me.

20:35.017 --> 20:38.432
- I don't think she did that.
- What's your problem?

20:38.604 --> 20:40.845
I got no problem.

20:41.022 --> 20:44.855
I just get the feeling
that you really want me to know...

20:45.027 --> 20:50.151
...that she made a phone call, and so
you lied about her asking for change.

20:50.323 --> 20:55.447
This is why people hate cops. You
cooperate, and you get the third degree.

20:57.997 --> 20:59.455
Hey, sit down.

21:00.582 --> 21:02.076
I said, sit down.

21:06.254 --> 21:09.208
Did you make a phone call too?
What's your name?

21:09.382 --> 21:12.715
- Lenny.
- Lenny, did you make a phone call too?

21:12.885 --> 21:16.633
Because her call was
to the Port Authority.

21:16.805 --> 21:21.680
I'm wondering who else might have
made a call that got Nicky whacked.

21:21.851 --> 21:24.390
Hey, I said all I'm gonna say.

21:24.563 --> 21:28.145
Listen, this girl is cooperating.
She saw the hitter.

21:28.316 --> 21:33.310
As soon as we pop that guy,
I will find out did you make that call.

21:33.487 --> 21:39.489
Don't cooperate, I'll make it worth some
time off to that guy, giving you up.

21:40.285 --> 21:42.325
- Come on, Lenny.
- All right.

21:42.496 --> 21:45.662
I didn't know.
Zeppo said Nicky owed him money.

21:45.832 --> 21:48.833
Yeah, right,
and I'm an lndian princess.

21:50.419 --> 21:53.704
All right, this Zeppo got a last name?

21:57.717 --> 21:59.675
Anybody doesn't look right.

21:59.844 --> 22:02.845
Keep an eye on the place,
talk to the super...

22:03.015 --> 22:06.596
...see if any front door locks
are broken, missing keys.

22:06.768 --> 22:10.682
Hey, you know what?
You don't need to bother her either.

22:10.855 --> 22:13.060
Good. That'd be great. Yeah.

22:13.774 --> 22:18.435
She goes back to one photo,
but she's too spooked to pick the guy.

22:18.611 --> 22:20.320
- Talking about Kimmy?
- Yeah.

22:20.489 --> 22:24.616
Would the guy she's looking at
be named Zeppo Marchansky?

22:26.202 --> 22:28.111
How'd you know that?

23:00.149 --> 23:01.775
[EXPLODING ]

23:01.943 --> 23:05.276
The boiler just exploded!
We have to get out!

23:07.239 --> 23:09.315
Get up against the wall.

23:09.492 --> 23:11.116
KELLY: Zeppo Marchansky?
- Yeah.

23:11.284 --> 23:13.775
KELLY: You're under arrest.
- You made a mistake.

23:13.953 --> 23:16.955
I got a face,
people think I'm somebody else.

23:17.124 --> 23:20.575
I got the same problem.
A woman the other day says:

23:20.752 --> 23:25.627
<i>"Bob, you were marvelous in The Sting. "
Get this asshole some clothes.</i>

23:42.480 --> 23:48.564
- I'm scared. I'm really scared.
- I promise, he cannot see you in here.

23:48.735 --> 23:52.815
If we cut him loose, you're in danger.
You'll be all right.

24:00.372 --> 24:01.782
Okay.

24:02.748 --> 24:05.417
It's number three.

24:06.377 --> 24:09.211
KELLY:
Good. That's good.

24:10.547 --> 24:13.464
Everybody but number three can leave.

24:17.470 --> 24:19.296
Bitch, you're dead meat!

24:19.472 --> 24:21.215
- He can see in!
KELLY: He cannot.

24:21.391 --> 24:23.466
He's guessing. Don't worry.

24:23.643 --> 24:26.595
You gonna take me to the grand jury
and get me killed?

24:26.770 --> 24:30.269
You gave us what we needed.
You gave the lD. Right?

24:30.440 --> 24:34.769
I'm not sure.
I need to think about this some more.

24:35.695 --> 24:38.021
Can I talk to you outside, please?

24:45.287 --> 24:49.700
Tell her that she's not gonna have
to testify for the grand jury.

24:49.874 --> 24:51.832
- How?
- Any way you want.

24:52.002 --> 24:56.130
- She has an excellent chance not to go.
- I'm not going to.

24:56.297 --> 25:00.508
If this guy doesn't testify
and doesn't give you the Olivas...

25:00.676 --> 25:03.961
...my boss is gonna make her
go to the grand jury.

25:04.138 --> 25:06.628
We can't flip him
unless he's lD'd.

25:06.807 --> 25:11.185
We can't get him lD'd unless
you talk to her and reassure her.

25:11.353 --> 25:14.520
- I'm not comfortable doing that.
- Okay.

25:22.613 --> 25:25.364
COSTAS:
Listen, understand and trust me.

25:25.532 --> 25:30.988
I speak with full authority. All we ask
is for you to lD that perpetrator.

25:31.163 --> 25:32.787
And the grand jury?

25:32.956 --> 25:37.284
We will exert every resource
to make your testimony unnecessary.

25:37.460 --> 25:41.457
Between the preliminary arraignment
and the grand jury...

25:41.630 --> 25:44.002
...we'll develop
corroborating evidence...

25:44.174 --> 25:48.467
...and simply name you anonymously
as a reliable informant.

25:51.390 --> 25:55.553
- Can I talk to you without them here?
- Of course.

26:03.108 --> 26:05.978
I'm not sure I can trust them,
after Nicky.

26:06.152 --> 26:09.273
This isn't coming from the cops.
It's from me.

26:09.448 --> 26:12.199
I want you to trust me on this.

26:16.663 --> 26:18.120
All right.

26:21.417 --> 26:23.041
It's number three.

26:27.339 --> 26:32.416
- You don't think I'll have to testify?
- You heard what I said.

26:34.428 --> 26:37.050
She lD'd your suspect.

26:39.433 --> 26:41.840
How could you lie to her like that?

26:42.019 --> 26:46.431
I said we'd make sure she won't have
to testify. I'll honor that.

26:46.607 --> 26:49.856
If push comes to shove,
you'll make her testify.

26:50.026 --> 26:53.608
Yes, if push comes to shove,
I will make her testify.

26:53.779 --> 26:55.902
Welcome to the world, sweetie.

26:59.076 --> 27:01.648
KELLY: Right over here.
KIMMY: Okay.

27:10.128 --> 27:14.042
Detective, there's a Dr. Schrager
here to see you.

27:14.214 --> 27:15.922
- For me?
- Yeah.

27:16.091 --> 27:18.498
Okay, would you give her some coffee?
Keep an eye on her.

27:18.677 --> 27:20.052
Sure.

27:22.681 --> 27:24.555
- Dr. Schrager?
SCHRAGER: Mm.

27:25.142 --> 27:29.353
John Kelly. You didn't have
to come in. I said give me a call.

27:29.521 --> 27:33.767
- I hope you don't mind, detective.
- No. Come on in.

27:33.941 --> 27:39.564
I just wanted to come down here
and see where Laurie spends her time.

27:40.572 --> 27:45.234
It's really very, very different
from the world that I live in.

27:45.411 --> 27:50.368
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
I work with children.

27:50.540 --> 27:53.493
Yeah, I got that
from the pediatric part.

27:56.879 --> 28:00.710
Well, Laurie just respects
the hell out of you.

28:00.881 --> 28:03.456
You don't need me to tell you that.

28:03.635 --> 28:06.007
Well, same goes for you.

28:07.597 --> 28:11.641
She mentioned to you
she feels like she's being followed.

28:11.809 --> 28:14.975
- Yeah, she has.
- You have any sense of that?

28:15.145 --> 28:18.347
Well, to be truthful, I don't, John...

28:18.523 --> 28:22.391
...but I'm the least paranoid guy
in the whole world.

28:22.777 --> 28:28.020
- Okay. You have any enemies?
- Me? No.

28:28.199 --> 28:32.990
- Malpractice suits, something like that?
- No, I've been very lucky.

28:33.161 --> 28:37.823
Although I have colleagues
just tell me some horror stories.

28:37.999 --> 28:40.751
- Ex- wife that's mad at you?
- Never married.

28:40.919 --> 28:42.248
Former girlfriend?

28:43.755 --> 28:45.130
No.

28:45.632 --> 28:47.209
Okay.

28:48.134 --> 28:51.549
It says you live
at 842 Central Park West.

28:51.720 --> 28:54.970
Right. It's a real schlep
from the hospital...

28:55.182 --> 29:00.424
...but, I tell you, I wouldn't give up
that view of the park for anything.

29:01.021 --> 29:04.057
Any trouble in the neighborhood
over there?

29:04.690 --> 29:08.059
Well, the co- op board is up in arms...

29:08.235 --> 29:12.648
...because there's a rock star
trying to move into the building.

29:12.822 --> 29:15.278
That's about as bad as it gets.

29:15.908 --> 29:20.406
Okay, okay. I think that's it.

29:22.124 --> 29:23.915
Thanks for coming in.

29:24.875 --> 29:29.169
Good. I'm hoping that eventually
you and I, we can be friends.

29:33.258 --> 29:37.671
KELLY: Yeah. Thanks for coming in.
- All right.

29:43.601 --> 29:46.092
LAURA:
What are you doing here?

29:49.148 --> 29:53.690
- John, you ready to talk to Zeppo?
- Oh, gee, Zeppo. Yep.

29:57.323 --> 29:58.353
Hey.

30:02.494 --> 30:05.280
- Soda or a cigarette?
- No, I don't smoke.

30:05.455 --> 30:06.699
Good for you.

30:06.872 --> 30:09.872
Don't have to be a scientist.
Smoking kills.

30:10.042 --> 30:13.541
Jail's unhealthy too.
People go downhill in jail.

30:13.711 --> 30:18.955
You've been lD'd for shooting Nicky.
We're talking major hard time here.

30:19.134 --> 30:24.376
Yeah, because that bitch lD'd me?
Hey, people change their minds.

30:24.888 --> 30:30.474
- What bitch would that be?
- The bitch. She thinks she lD'd me.

30:32.478 --> 30:37.390
You shot this guy in front of people.
You don't think we have witnesses?

30:37.568 --> 30:40.188
SlPOWlCZ:
You got to look up, Zeppo. Up.

30:40.361 --> 30:46.114
If you'd looked up, you'd realize that
it wasn't smart, where you whacked him.

30:46.283 --> 30:48.405
Look up? Some sea gull flew by?

30:48.577 --> 30:53.404
A neighborhood woman with arthritis.
She looks out the window all day.

30:53.582 --> 30:55.704
It's like going to the movies.

30:55.876 --> 30:59.576
She calls her husband to the window.
They both saw it.

30:59.754 --> 31:03.538
You don't wanna go to bat on this one.
We got witnesses.

31:03.716 --> 31:07.416
Okay, recess is over now.
You follow this arithmetic.

31:07.594 --> 31:11.675
You do 25 years, you'll be 60
by the time you see the board.

31:11.849 --> 31:17.435
They'll turn you down, you'll be 63
before you got a chance of getting out.

- Depends on what you have.

- Was it the Olivas?

31:43.710 --> 31:47.161
Marchansky agreed.
They send him to Rikers, wired.

- Without an escort?
- With an escort, some trustee notices.

31:51.593 --> 31:56.385
- It'll get to the Olivas.
- It's a big risk to be unaccompanied.

31:56.555 --> 31:59.093

and be outside.
