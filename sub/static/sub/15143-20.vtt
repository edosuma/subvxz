WEBVTT

00:10.834 --> 00:12.250
Ta-da!

00:12.291 --> 00:14.500
Thank you, thank you.

00:14.542 --> 00:15.834
And now,

00:15.875 --> 00:19.792
for The Amazing Rickini's

00:15.875 --> 00:19.792
next trick...

00:19.834 --> 00:22.834
Oscar said he's gonna have

00:19.834 --> 00:22.834
a video game bus at his party.

00:22.875 --> 00:25.625
And a chocolate fountain

00:22.875 --> 00:25.625
with all the dippins.

00:25.667 --> 00:27.917
Speaking of dippins,

00:27.959 --> 00:30.333
how about I dippins

00:27.959 --> 00:30.333
to this box

00:30.375 --> 00:32.667
and pull out another trick?

00:32.709 --> 00:35.250
Ooh, I heard karaoke

00:32.709 --> 00:35.250
is gonna be there.

00:35.291 --> 00:36.583
You don't like to sing.

00:36.625 --> 00:39.125
No, Carrie Oakie.

00:39.166 --> 00:42.959
That cute girl from

00:39.166 --> 00:42.959
math class.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.333
Come on, guys.

00:44.375 --> 00:46.208
I need you to pay attention.

00:46.250 --> 00:48.583
Magic's not magic

00:46.250 --> 00:48.583
without an audience.

00:48.625 --> 00:50.208
It's like the light

00:48.625 --> 00:50.208
in the fridge:

00:50.250 --> 00:53.041
since there's no audience

00:50.250 --> 00:53.041
inside to see it,

00:53.083 --> 00:56.709
do we really know if it turns

00:53.083 --> 00:56.709
off when you close the door?

00:56.750 --> 00:58.959
You're right,

00:56.750 --> 00:58.959
we don't know.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.250
Or do we?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.250
No, we don't.

01:01.291 --> 01:03.166
Or do we?

01:03.208 --> 01:07.542
Now observe as I magically

01:03.208 --> 01:07.542
separate these rings.

01:12.208 --> 01:15.333
You know, there is gonna be

01:12.208 --> 01:15.333
a magician at Oscar's party.

01:15.375 --> 01:17.250
Maybe you can ask him

01:15.375 --> 01:17.250
how to do that trick

01:17.291 --> 01:19.458
without the poo-poo face.

01:19.500 --> 01:20.500
First of all,

01:20.542 --> 01:24.208
this is not

01:20.542 --> 01:24.208
my poo-poo face,

01:24.250 --> 01:26.917
and second,

01:26.959 --> 01:30.333
I've already got a whole list

01:26.959 --> 01:30.333
of questions prepared.

01:30.375 --> 01:32.959
For example:

01:30.375 --> 01:32.959
when will I grow armpit hair?

01:33.000 --> 01:35.834
This list is for Dad.

01:35.875 --> 01:37.125
What are those?

01:37.166 --> 01:38.458
Smoke pellets.

01:38.500 --> 01:39.625
[all]

01:38.500 --> 01:39.625
Ooh.

01:39.667 --> 01:41.583
Bup, bup, bup.

01:39.667 --> 01:41.583
They're not toys.

01:41.625 --> 01:44.792
They're an important part

01:41.625 --> 01:44.792
of a magician's toolbox.

01:44.834 --> 01:48.291
They create a cloud of smoke

01:44.834 --> 01:48.291
to distract the audience.

01:50.834 --> 01:53.125
Mom and Dad said I can't

01:50.834 --> 01:53.125
use these in the house.

01:53.166 --> 01:54.041
What if they come in?

01:54.083 --> 01:55.709
They won't.

01:55.750 --> 01:57.625
They're outside

01:55.750 --> 01:57.625
cleaning the gutters.

01:57.667 --> 01:59.458
We're not gonna

01:57.667 --> 01:59.458
leave you hanging.

01:59.500 --> 02:02.250
If you get in trouble,

01:59.500 --> 02:02.250
we all get in trouble.

02:02.291 --> 02:06.291
Yeah, we stick together.

02:02.291 --> 02:06.291
It's the Quad Code.

02:06.333 --> 02:10.208
All for Quad

02:06.333 --> 02:10.208
and Quad for All.

02:10.250 --> 02:11.875
[sighs]

02:11.917 --> 02:13.291
Okay, I'll do it.

02:13.333 --> 02:14.875
[all]

02:13.333 --> 02:14.875
Yes!

02:14.917 --> 02:18.333
Now stand back

02:14.917 --> 02:18.333
and watch The Amazing Rickini

02:18.375 --> 02:21.375
make Squishy Paws

02:18.375 --> 02:21.375
disappear.

02:21.417 --> 02:24.917
Abracadabra, alakazam.

02:24.959 --> 02:28.792
In a puff of smoke,

02:24.959 --> 02:28.792
Squishy will scram!

02:32.166 --> 02:35.000
[both coughing]

02:35.041 --> 02:36.750
Ricky.

02:36.792 --> 02:38.458
What do you have to say

02:36.792 --> 02:38.458
for yourself?

02:42.166 --> 02:45.333

Ricky,

03:21.959 --> 03:23.625
what were you thinking?

03:23.667 --> 03:25.667
You know you're not allowed to

03:23.667 --> 03:25.667
use smoke pellets in the house.

03:25.709 --> 03:27.458
I wasn't using them.

03:27.500 --> 03:30.834
It's all an illusion.

03:30.875 --> 03:33.917
It wasn't an illusion.

03:33.959 --> 03:36.792
Which means you're in

03:33.959 --> 03:36.792
a lot of trouble.

03:41.583 --> 03:44.917
- Why do I feel like

03:41.583 --> 03:44.917
this is all our fault?

03:41.583 --> 03:44.917
- 'Cause it's all our fault.

03:44.959 --> 03:47.375
- Then why are

03:44.959 --> 03:47.375
we hiding in here?

03:44.959 --> 03:47.375
- 'Cause it's all our fault.

03:47.417 --> 03:49.417
But we told Ricky

03:47.417 --> 03:49.417
we'd stick together.

03:49.458 --> 03:53.709
- [sighs]

03:49.458 --> 03:53.709
Dicky, what do you think?

03:49.458 --> 03:53.709
- I think the light

03:49.458 --> 03:53.709
just stays on.

03:53.750 --> 03:56.166
On, on, on, can't see it.

03:56.208 --> 03:59.500
On, on, on, on,

03:56.208 --> 03:59.500
can't see it.

03:59.542 --> 04:00.375
On, on, on--

04:00.417 --> 04:03.458
Dicky, focus!

04:03.500 --> 04:06.417
What happened to "All for Quad

04:03.500 --> 04:06.417
and Quad for All"?

04:06.458 --> 04:09.250
Yeah, we probably

04:06.458 --> 04:09.250
shouldn't bail on him.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.417
Fine, so let's go tell

04:09.291 --> 04:11.417
Mom and Dad

04:11.458 --> 04:14.208
whatever punishment Ricky gets,

04:11.458 --> 04:14.208
we deserve, too.

04:17.208 --> 04:19.875
I don't care if Oscar's party

04:17.208 --> 04:19.875
is gonna be magical.

04:19.917 --> 04:22.333
You're grounded

04:19.917 --> 04:22.333
and you're not going.

04:22.375 --> 04:23.875
[Ricky]

04:22.375 --> 04:23.875
What? No way!

04:23.917 --> 04:26.583
On the other hand,

04:23.917 --> 04:26.583
why should we all suffer?

04:31.917 --> 04:34.667
"Stick together," they said!

04:34.709 --> 04:38.125
"Quad for All," they said!

04:38.166 --> 04:41.166
We've both suffered for

04:38.166 --> 04:41.166
our craft, Wondrous Androoni.

04:41.208 --> 04:43.792
All in the name of magic!

04:45.959 --> 04:48.291
Magic's hard.

04:48.333 --> 04:49.583
- Hey, buddy.

04:49.625 --> 04:51.333
Don't "hey, buddy" me.

04:51.375 --> 04:52.709
Hey, pal.

04:52.750 --> 04:55.625
That's the same as buddy.

04:55.667 --> 04:57.583
I can't believe

04:55.667 --> 04:57.583
you bailed on me.

04:57.625 --> 05:00.875
In our defense, it was only

04:57.625 --> 05:00.875
because we didn't want to miss

04:57.625 --> 05:00.875
out on the party.

05:00.917 --> 05:02.834
We were gonna

05:00.917 --> 05:02.834
do the right thing,

05:02.875 --> 05:06.542
but this party is

05:02.875 --> 05:06.542
going to be awesome.

05:06.583 --> 05:08.000
If you were allowed

05:06.583 --> 05:08.000
to go,

05:08.041 --> 05:11.208
you'd totally understand

05:08.041 --> 05:11.208
our position.

05:11.250 --> 05:12.500
So, we're good here?

05:12.542 --> 05:14.208
Oh, we're good.

05:14.250 --> 05:16.375
Go to your awesome party,

05:14.250 --> 05:16.375
backstabbers.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.834
I have plenty of awesome stuff

05:16.417 --> 05:18.834
happening right here.

05:18.875 --> 05:20.917
Like finally organizing my desk.

05:23.291 --> 05:24.250
Ricky, don't be mad--

05:24.291 --> 05:27.000
Go! This could take me

05:24.291 --> 05:27.000
all night.

05:36.667 --> 05:38.250
Done!

05:38.291 --> 05:40.208
Darn it.

05:45.875 --> 05:47.500
The video game bus

05:45.875 --> 05:47.500
is here!

05:47.542 --> 05:50.125
I get to play the same

05:47.542 --> 05:50.125
video games I play at home,

05:50.166 --> 05:52.083
but on a bus!

05:52.125 --> 05:53.959
Check it out!

05:54.000 --> 05:57.458
You can dip anything

05:54.000 --> 05:57.458
in the chocolate fountain.

05:57.500 --> 06:01.333
I dipped a taco.

06:01.375 --> 06:03.583
Ugh, chocolate meat!

06:03.625 --> 06:06.959
Chocolate meat!

06:07.000 --> 06:09.875
Man, look at

06:07.000 --> 06:09.875
all this magic stuff.

06:09.917 --> 06:12.083
Ricky would love this.

06:12.125 --> 06:14.375
I thought we agreed we weren't

06:12.125 --> 06:14.375
gonna talk about Ricky.

06:14.417 --> 06:16.625
Hey, where's Ricky?

06:16.667 --> 06:17.959
He couldn't come.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.333
Oh, that's a crying shame.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.333
That boy loves magic.

06:21.375 --> 06:23.125
Oh, well.

06:21.375 --> 06:23.125
Enjoy the party.

06:27.250 --> 06:29.458
All right, now can we try

06:27.250 --> 06:29.458
to have a good time

06:29.500 --> 06:30.709
and forget about Ricky?

06:30.750 --> 06:32.583
Hey, guys.

06:30.750 --> 06:32.583
Where's Ricky?

06:32.625 --> 06:34.875
[all]

06:32.625 --> 06:34.875
He's not here!

06:34.917 --> 06:37.750
Wow, that's surprising.

06:34.917 --> 06:37.750
That boy loves magic.

06:37.792 --> 06:40.166
If I had to pick one quad out of

06:37.792 --> 06:40.166
all of you that should be here,

06:40.208 --> 06:41.959
it would be him.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.583
Oh, well.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.583
Have a good time.

06:46.625 --> 06:49.000
All right, maybe we should

06:46.625 --> 06:49.000
just stay away from people.

06:51.125 --> 06:53.917
Hey, maybe this will help us

06:51.125 --> 06:53.917
forget about Ricky.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.041
I know what

06:57.000 --> 07:01.041
you are thinking.

07:01.083 --> 07:02.625
[all]

07:01.083 --> 07:02.625
Aah!

07:05.667 --> 07:07.500
All right, the kids are

07:05.667 --> 07:07.500
at the party,

07:07.542 --> 07:08.834
Ricky's upstairs grounded,

07:08.875 --> 07:10.041
and I am done

07:08.875 --> 07:10.041
cleaning the gutters.

07:10.083 --> 07:12.125
Which means,

07:12.166 --> 07:14.000
it's Tom time.

07:14.041 --> 07:15.041
Hmm.

07:15.083 --> 07:18.333
How about we make it

07:15.083 --> 07:18.333
Tom and Anne time?

07:18.375 --> 07:20.458
I'm listening.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.125
I'm no longer listening.

07:22.166 --> 07:23.792
Come on, Tom, we have to

07:22.166 --> 07:23.792
clean this place.

07:23.834 --> 07:25.875
Ricky's magic dust is

07:23.834 --> 07:25.875
everywhere.

07:25.917 --> 07:27.083
It's not that bad.

07:27.125 --> 07:28.250
[sighs]

07:28.291 --> 07:31.166
[coughing]

07:31.208 --> 07:33.875
Don't worry.

07:31.208 --> 07:33.875
It'll settle.

07:33.917 --> 07:37.500
You know what, fine, but let's

07:33.917 --> 07:37.500
at least make this interesting.

07:37.542 --> 07:40.125
If I make this into the fruit

07:37.542 --> 07:40.125
basket, you clean up the mess.

07:40.166 --> 07:42.875
Sweetie, didn't you learn

07:40.166 --> 07:42.875
your lesson from the gutters?

07:42.917 --> 07:44.083
Every time you don't

07:42.917 --> 07:44.083
want to clean,

07:44.125 --> 07:46.542
you challenge me

07:44.125 --> 07:46.542
to some game, I win,

07:46.583 --> 07:48.417
and you end up having to

07:46.583 --> 07:48.417
do it all by yourself.

07:48.458 --> 07:49.500
What's the matter, Anne?

07:49.542 --> 07:50.500
You afraid

07:49.542 --> 07:50.500
your lucky streak is over?

07:50.542 --> 07:51.500
[laughs]

07:51.542 --> 07:53.208
Huh? Huh?

07:51.542 --> 07:53.208
Here we go.

07:53.250 --> 07:56.417
[exhales]

07:56.458 --> 07:57.458
- Hey!

07:56.458 --> 07:57.458
- Boom!

07:57.500 --> 07:58.375
No blocksies!

07:58.417 --> 07:59.375
You never called

07:58.417 --> 07:59.375
"no blocksies."

07:59.417 --> 08:00.834
Oh, you want to play

07:59.417 --> 08:00.834
street rules?

08:00.875 --> 08:02.166
All right, all right,

08:00.875 --> 08:02.166
let's go, Harper.

08:02.208 --> 08:04.000
- First to ten, wins.

08:02.208 --> 08:04.000
- I'll spot you nine.

08:04.041 --> 08:05.625
Hey, I have my pride, Anne.

08:05.667 --> 08:07.375
- Pfft.

08:05.667 --> 08:07.375
- I'll take eight.

08:07.417 --> 08:08.959
Oh, ho ho,

08:07.417 --> 08:08.959
not in my house, Stretch.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.083
You might want to get

08:09.000 --> 08:10.083
some ointment,

08:10.125 --> 08:12.875
'cause you're about

08:10.125 --> 08:12.875
to get burned.

08:12.917 --> 08:14.000
We're actually really

08:12.917 --> 08:14.000
out of ointment,

08:14.041 --> 08:15.250
so next time we're by

08:14.041 --> 08:15.250
the pharmacy...

08:15.291 --> 08:16.667
Got it.

08:16.709 --> 08:18.000
- Hoo!

08:16.709 --> 08:18.000
- Ooh!

08:18.041 --> 08:19.125
[Nicky]

08:18.041 --> 08:19.125
This thing's freaking me out.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.083
It looks

08:19.166 --> 08:21.083
just like Ricky.

08:21.125 --> 08:23.083
It's not Ricky, it's just

08:21.125 --> 08:23.083
a mind-reading robot.

08:23.125 --> 08:24.917
Ooh, maybe it can

08:23.125 --> 08:24.917
read my mind.

08:27.583 --> 08:30.667
Whoa, he's good.

08:30.709 --> 08:31.750
He didn't say anything.

08:31.792 --> 08:33.792
I wasn't thinking

08:31.792 --> 08:33.792
anything.

08:33.834 --> 08:35.583
You have to press the button

08:33.834 --> 08:35.583
first.

08:35.625 --> 08:37.458
Let me try.

08:37.500 --> 08:41.083
Do I feel guilty

08:37.500 --> 08:41.083
for bailing on Ricky?

08:41.125 --> 08:43.917
Your heart knows

08:41.125 --> 08:43.917
the answer.

08:43.959 --> 08:46.250
It does.

08:43.959 --> 08:46.250
And I do!

08:46.291 --> 08:49.000
This is silly.

08:46.291 --> 08:49.000
It's just answering randomly.

08:49.041 --> 08:50.959
Okay, my turn.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.417
Oh, Great Cosmo,

08:52.458 --> 08:56.000
did we do the wrong thing

08:52.458 --> 08:56.000
leaving Ricky at home?

08:56.041 --> 08:59.000
Your path soon

08:56.041 --> 08:59.000
will become clear.

08:59.041 --> 09:00.667
What do you mean?

09:00.709 --> 09:02.834
It's not like we can just sneak

09:00.709 --> 09:02.834
him out and bring him over here.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.834
Look for a sign.

09:04.875 --> 09:06.166
Attention.

09:06.208 --> 09:08.083
In ten minutes,

09:06.208 --> 09:08.083
the magic show will begin

09:08.125 --> 09:09.625
with our very special guest,

09:09.667 --> 09:11.917
The Wondrous Androoni!

09:11.959 --> 09:13.917
[cheers and applause]

09:13.959 --> 09:16.667
Oh, that's Ricky's

09:13.959 --> 09:16.667
favorite magician.

09:16.709 --> 09:18.166
Maybe that's a sign.

09:18.208 --> 09:21.625
No, that's not a sign.

09:18.208 --> 09:21.625
It's a coincidence.

09:21.667 --> 09:23.875
[electricity crackles]

09:23.917 --> 09:27.208
It says "Get Ricky."

09:27.250 --> 09:29.542
Okay,

09:27.250 --> 09:29.542
now that's a sign.

09:34.333 --> 09:37.750
All right, Anne,

09:34.333 --> 09:37.750
playtime's over.

09:37.792 --> 09:40.125
It's time to... play.

09:40.166 --> 09:42.458
[blows whistle]

09:42.500 --> 09:44.208
This ain't no roller derby.

09:44.250 --> 09:47.166
Hey, you called street rules,

09:44.250 --> 09:47.166
Scaredy Shorts.

09:47.208 --> 09:48.417
They should call you

09:47.208 --> 09:48.417
Elevator,

09:48.458 --> 09:50.667
cause you're, bing,

09:48.458 --> 09:50.667
going down!

09:50.709 --> 09:51.792
You wish.

09:51.834 --> 09:52.917
- Okay.

09:51.834 --> 09:52.917
- Here we go.

09:52.959 --> 09:54.250
Oh, wait, wait,

09:52.959 --> 09:54.250
wait, wait.

09:54.291 --> 09:55.834
Should we be doing this

09:54.291 --> 09:55.834
here in the living room?

09:55.875 --> 09:58.083
I mean, what kind of message

09:55.875 --> 09:58.083
does it send to the kids?

09:58.125 --> 09:59.500
Ah, they'll never see us.

09:58.125 --> 09:59.500
Boink!

09:59.542 --> 10:00.959
Hey! No, no!

10:01.000 --> 10:01.792
Just going to the bathroom!

10:01.834 --> 10:02.750
[Dicky]

10:01.834 --> 10:02.750
Together!

10:02.792 --> 10:05.917
No time to talk.

10:05.959 --> 10:09.166
Ricky!

10:09.208 --> 10:11.166
He made himself

10:09.208 --> 10:11.166
disappear.

10:11.208 --> 10:13.667
I'm over here.

10:13.709 --> 10:14.959
Whoa!

10:15.000 --> 10:18.583
Wow, he's really improved.

10:18.625 --> 10:21.792
Ricky, you are seriously missing

10:18.625 --> 10:21.792
out on the best party ever.

10:21.834 --> 10:23.959
And you came all the way

10:21.834 --> 10:23.959
back home just to rub it in?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.208
Classy.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.250
No, we came

10:25.250 --> 10:27.250
to break you out.

10:27.291 --> 10:28.542
You need to come

10:27.291 --> 10:28.542
with us.

10:28.583 --> 10:32.041
No way. I'm already grounded

10:28.583 --> 10:32.041
because of you.

10:32.083 --> 10:33.709
And if I do this

10:32.083 --> 10:33.709
and get caught,

10:33.750 --> 10:37.583
I'll be in even more trouble

10:33.750 --> 10:37.583
because of you.

10:37.625 --> 10:39.291
The Wondrous Androoni's

10:37.625 --> 10:39.291
performing.

10:39.333 --> 10:41.291
I'll get my coat.

10:41.333 --> 10:43.458
Wait. How are we gonna

10:41.333 --> 10:43.458
sneak him out?

10:43.500 --> 10:45.208
Just meet me

10:43.500 --> 10:45.208
at the party.

10:45.250 --> 10:46.917
I'll create the illusion

10:45.250 --> 10:46.917
I'm still here.

10:46.959 --> 10:48.625
Then make myself...

10:48.667 --> 10:51.041
disappear.

10:51.083 --> 10:53.417
You sure

10:51.083 --> 10:53.417
you can pull it off?

10:53.458 --> 10:56.333
Trust me, I've got

10:53.458 --> 10:56.333
a few tricks up my sleeve.

10:56.375 --> 10:59.583
[upbeat music]

10:59.625 --> 11:01.834
Bring it, chump.

11:01.875 --> 11:03.333
Hey, Mom and Dad,

11:03.375 --> 11:06.291
I'm gonna listen to my hour-long

11:03.375 --> 11:06.291
crossword puzzle podcast.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.834
Tonight's

11:06.333 --> 11:07.834
the Crossie Awards.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.500
The competition for the best

11:07.875 --> 11:10.500
down word is intense.

11:10.542 --> 11:13.208
Anyway, no need to check on me

11:10.542 --> 11:13.208
for the next hour.

11:13.250 --> 11:14.667
Hey, what's that

11:13.250 --> 11:14.667
in the kitchen?

11:18.583 --> 11:21.625
Magic is all about...

11:21.667 --> 11:23.667
wonder.

11:26.542 --> 11:28.709
Aah! Aah!

11:28.750 --> 11:31.041
[applause]

11:31.083 --> 11:33.166
Classic Androoni.

11:33.208 --> 11:34.709
Soak it all in,

11:33.208 --> 11:34.709
'cause in ten minutes,

11:34.750 --> 11:38.583
your podcast is over

11:34.750 --> 11:38.583
and we gotta get you back.

11:38.625 --> 11:40.250
For my next trick,

11:40.291 --> 11:43.291
I'm going to need

11:40.291 --> 11:43.291
a volunteer.

11:45.917 --> 11:47.834
You, I guess.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.125
Ricky Harper.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.125
And I am your biggest fan.

11:50.166 --> 11:54.041
By the way, I have a list

11:50.166 --> 11:54.041
of questions for you.

11:54.083 --> 11:56.375
Who wants to see Ricky

11:54.083 --> 11:56.375
and his questions

11:56.417 --> 11:57.792
disappear?

11:57.834 --> 12:01.250
[cheers and applause]

12:01.291 --> 12:02.875
Get ready

12:02.917 --> 12:06.834
to be filled with wonder!

12:06.875 --> 12:08.458
One...

12:08.500 --> 12:10.291
Two...

12:10.333 --> 12:12.709
Three!

12:12.750 --> 12:17.709
[cheers and applause]

12:17.750 --> 12:20.542
I wonder where he is.

12:20.583 --> 12:22.750
Could he be in here?

12:25.792 --> 12:27.291
I wonder

12:27.333 --> 12:30.500
why he's not in there?

12:30.542 --> 12:33.417
The Wondrous Androoni

12:30.542 --> 12:33.417
will be back

12:33.458 --> 12:36.333
after a short Wonder-mission.

12:36.375 --> 12:38.542
[applause]

12:38.583 --> 12:40.000
He's good.

12:40.041 --> 12:44.125
A little too good.

12:44.166 --> 12:45.875
Excuse me,

12:44.166 --> 12:45.875
Mr. Androoni--

12:45.917 --> 12:50.500
Mr. Androoni was my father.

12:45.917 --> 12:50.500
Call me Wondrous.

12:50.542 --> 12:52.583
Yeah, look, Wondrous,

12:50.542 --> 12:52.583
we need our brother back.

12:52.625 --> 12:54.875
I wonder where he is.

12:54.917 --> 12:57.125
You lost our brother!

12:57.166 --> 13:00.041
The Wondrous Androoni

12:57.166 --> 13:00.041
has never lost anyone...

13:00.083 --> 13:01.583
until now.

13:01.625 --> 13:03.125
Magic's hard.

13:08.417 --> 13:10.834
Guys, we have five minutes to

13:08.417 --> 13:10.834
get Ricky back to the house.

13:10.875 --> 13:12.917
But he's in

13:10.875 --> 13:12.917
the magic netherworld.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.875
He's gotta be around here

13:12.959 --> 13:14.875
somewhere.

13:14.917 --> 13:16.208
You two stay here

13:14.917 --> 13:16.208
and look for him.

13:16.250 --> 13:17.792
I'm gonna go home

13:16.250 --> 13:17.792
and stall Mom and Dad.

13:17.834 --> 13:20.208
How are you

13:17.834 --> 13:20.208
gonna do that?

13:20.250 --> 13:23.709
The answer is right

13:20.250 --> 13:23.709
in front of you.

13:23.750 --> 13:27.375
I think I know someone

13:23.750 --> 13:27.375
who can help.

13:27.417 --> 13:28.709
Who?

13:34.542 --> 13:36.250
- Okay.

13:36.291 --> 13:37.875
- All tied up.

13:36.291 --> 13:37.875
- Okay.

13:37.917 --> 13:39.166
Next basket wins.

13:39.208 --> 13:40.917
Got it.

13:39.208 --> 13:40.917
Let's go.

13:43.542 --> 13:45.500
Yeah.

13:45.542 --> 13:49.250
Ooh. Hoo.

13:45.542 --> 13:49.250
Okay.

13:49.291 --> 13:51.500
- Ho!

13:49.291 --> 13:51.500
- No, no! Oh!

13:51.542 --> 13:52.500
Oh!

13:52.542 --> 13:53.709
My vase!

13:53.750 --> 13:56.417
First of all,

13:53.750 --> 13:56.417
it's vahhz.

13:56.458 --> 13:57.625
Oh!

13:57.667 --> 13:59.709
And secondly...

13:59.750 --> 14:01.709
Boom!

13:59.750 --> 14:01.709
Tomahawk!

14:01.750 --> 14:03.458
Yeah!

14:03.500 --> 14:07.417
I can't believe you broke

14:03.500 --> 14:07.417
my vase just so you could win!

14:07.458 --> 14:09.000
Hey, guys!

14:09.041 --> 14:10.208
Hey.

14:09.041 --> 14:10.208
You're back again?

14:10.250 --> 14:12.875
Crazy line for the bathroom.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.875
Gotta go!

14:12.917 --> 14:14.792
You know, she does have

14:12.917 --> 14:14.792
your tiny bladder.

14:26.083 --> 14:28.417
Come on, Cosmo.

14:28.458 --> 14:30.333
I can't believe

14:28.458 --> 14:30.333
you cheated.

14:30.375 --> 14:33.542
I did not.

14:30.375 --> 14:33.542
I broke your vahhz by accident.

14:33.583 --> 14:37.583
I can tell you're lying

14:33.583 --> 14:37.583
by that smirk on your...fahhz.

14:37.625 --> 14:39.041
- Accident.

14:37.625 --> 14:39.041
- Purpose!

14:39.083 --> 14:40.375
La la la la la!

14:52.417 --> 14:54.542
[footsteps approaching]

14:54.583 --> 14:55.458
Uh-oh.

15:01.959 --> 15:05.458
Hey, sweetie, you awake?

15:05.500 --> 15:09.166
Oh, good.

15:05.500 --> 15:09.166
How was your podcast?

15:09.208 --> 15:12.834
Did all your favorite words win?

15:12.875 --> 15:14.458
Honey?

15:20.125 --> 15:21.291
I know you're still mad

15:20.125 --> 15:21.291
about the party,

15:21.333 --> 15:25.166
but you need to talk to me.

15:25.208 --> 15:28.291
I know what

15:25.208 --> 15:28.291
you're thinking.

15:28.333 --> 15:30.959
Wait, really?

15:28.333 --> 15:30.959
Is it that obvious?

15:32.125 --> 15:34.000
Your mind is

15:32.125 --> 15:34.000
an open book.

15:34.041 --> 15:36.583
Oh, huh.
