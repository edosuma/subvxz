WEBVTT

00:10.000 --> 00:20.000
TRESPASS (2011)

00:29.160 --> 00:32.369
I don't understand why we
can 't continue construction.

00:32.439 --> 00:34.363
We could become partners.

00:34.440 --> 00:37.410
Well, If you finish it, we can sell it.

00:37.480 --> 00:39.130
You're being unreasonable.

00:39.200 --> 00:41.931
Look, you're bleeding us dry!

00:42.000 --> 00:46.130
Don't twist. Everyone knows real
estate 's in trouble. Come on!

00:46.200 --> 00:49.170
We sell, everybody wins.

00:49.240 --> 00:51.561
I-I'll get you
some money.

00:51.640 --> 00:55.247
No, don't hang up.
Goddamit.

00:58.640 --> 01:01.007
Mr. Kaplan,
Kyle Miller again.

01:01.120 --> 01:04.488
Yeah, hi. I'm calling about the
golconda diamond that we discussed.

01:04.560 --> 01:08.121
Well, I have a buyer.
I know we haven't done business before

01:08.200 --> 01:10.771
but I assure you I can be
an asset to your company.

01:10.880 --> 01:13.565
Let me show you what I
can do with this stone.

01:13.680 --> 01:18.242
No, I won't take commission. What do you have to lose?
It's my contact and my risk.

01:18.320 --> 01:20.846
I guarantee it's 100% reliable.

01:20.920 --> 01:23.446
If this goes upside down,
it's on me, okay?

01:23.560 --> 01:27.281
Hang up. Hang up.
I'm calling him now. Thanks.

01:33.040 --> 01:36.806
Emile Strewart?
Kyle Miller. How are you?

01:36.880 --> 01:39.087
Hey, Mom, can I go to a party?

01:39.200 --> 01:41.168
Come on, Avery. Not tonight.

01:41.240 --> 01:43.447
Please?

01:43.520 --> 01:47.286
It's at this guy Jake's house.
Everyone's going.

01:47.360 --> 01:49.408
Who's everyone?

01:49.480 --> 01:50.970
Friends from school.

01:51.040 --> 01:52.883
Why are you being so vague about it?

01:52.960 --> 01:55.645
I'm not. Hang on.
I'm getting water-boarded.

01:57.440 --> 01:59.044
Please? It's
no big thing.

01:59.120 --> 02:01.441
Yeah? Well, if
it's no big thing,

02:01.520 --> 02:04.364
why can't you tell me who
you're going with? Hm?

02:04.440 --> 02:07.569
So, that little daydream we discussed.

02:07.640 --> 02:09.926
Yes, the flawless one.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.050
Well, it turns out it could
be yours provided that, uh...

02:14.120 --> 02:16.043
Just a minute.

02:16.120 --> 02:19.761
Provided that you come up
with a less insulting number.

02:19.840 --> 02:23.083
No, you're gonna have to do a
little bit better than that, Emile,

02:23.160 --> 02:24.889
or my seller's gonna walk.

02:24.960 --> 02:27.008
It's just a party.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.003
With Kendra?

02:29.080 --> 02:31.606
Why do you have such a
problem with Kendra?

02:31.720 --> 02:35.611
Avery, I just thought we could have dinner at
home tonight as a family. Your Dad's back.

02:35.680 --> 02:37.444
I thought it'd be nice.

02:37.520 --> 02:40.569
I don't wanna have dinner.
I wanna go to a party.

02:40.680 --> 02:43.286
Well, I said no.

02:43.360 --> 02:45.124
Emile. Emile.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.531
Fine, I'll ask Dad.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.523
Okay. Ask him.

02:48.600 --> 02:52.127
Emile, Stafford's offering two
percent above your price.

02:52.200 --> 02:55.647
Yes! That Stafford.
Carl Stafford.

02:57.360 --> 02:59.328
Mom's being arbitrary and inflexible.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.004
Oh, come on.

03:01.080 --> 03:03.242
I need hugs.

03:03.320 --> 03:05.971
What difference does it make if
Carl said it or he didn't say it?

03:06.080 --> 03:08.287
The point is you're
getting a damn good rock.

03:08.360 --> 03:10.567
Uh, just a minute.

03:10.640 --> 03:12.688
Did you wear that to school?

03:12.760 --> 03:14.205
Can I go to a friend's party?

03:14.280 --> 03:16.726
No.

03:16.840 --> 03:18.842
I have to go with your mother on this.

03:18.920 --> 03:20.570
No! I wanna
meet with you.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.563
You don't know what we
we're talking about.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.330
Yes. We were
talking about Kendra.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.448
That means boys, probably older,

03:26.560 --> 03:29.450
and that is every father's worst nightmare.
I'm sorry, Sweetie.

03:29.560 --> 03:32.291
Yes, yes. I'm back.
No, tonight is fine.

03:32.360 --> 03:35.125
Uh, I could be there
in 30,45 with traffic.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.771
Whatever you two are going through
treating me like a child,

03:37.840 --> 03:39.569
isn't gonna make anything any better.

03:39.640 --> 03:41.688
Are we going through something?

03:41.760 --> 03:43.205
I don't know.
Are we?

03:45.200 --> 03:47.407
Look, I'm sorry about all this.
It's just...

03:47.480 --> 03:50.051
It's just a bit crazy
here at the office today.

03:50.120 --> 03:54.170
Yes. Well, I don't think
you're really hearing me.

03:54.240 --> 03:56.083
Emile, this is the flawless.

03:56.160 --> 03:58.401
It's whiter than the
snow on Mount Fuji.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.005
Are you cartooning me?
This is a 2A diamond

04:03.080 --> 04:05.970
so clear you will weep.
You will just weep.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.805
I mean, in any other circumstance
a four karat golconda

04:08.880 --> 04:11.201
is 1.5 million dollars.
I mean, this is a steal.

04:11.280 --> 04:14.204
I'm inviting you to steal from me.
Yes, cash.

04:14.280 --> 04:16.680
This is a basement price.

04:16.760 --> 04:18.841
I'm not even taking a commission.

04:18.920 --> 04:21.651
No, it has to be cash.

04:21.760 --> 04:25.367
Thank you. Thank you, Emile.
I'm glad we could come to an understanding.

04:25.440 --> 04:28.330
And you won't be
disappointed. Good-bye.

05:16.920 --> 05:19.241
Kyle?

05:19.320 --> 05:21.448
I'm on the phone.

05:21.520 --> 05:25.650
I just wondered if you wanted
something to eat before you go out.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.842
Uh, no, I'll pick something up.

05:47.360 --> 05:51.285
Please don't say it's all because you
love me and you're worried about me.

05:52.880 --> 05:55.281
Honey, you have to eat something.

05:55.360 --> 05:57.567
I'm not hungry.

05:57.640 --> 06:01.440
All right.
Well, I'm just gonna leave it here.

06:01.520 --> 06:03.727
It's yummy.

06:06.160 --> 06:10.051
Avery, you're so pretty and
you're so smart and you...

06:12.000 --> 06:15.004
You just don't have to be
in such a hurry to grow up.

06:18.720 --> 06:20.609
I love you, baby.

06:20.680 --> 06:23.889
I know, Mom.
I love you, too.

08:05.480 --> 08:08.131
Hey.

08:11.760 --> 08:13.967
They think you're a bad influence.

08:14.040 --> 08:16.088
They're right.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.289
You know, I'm actually pretty sure

08:20.360 --> 08:22.681
that my mom is having sex
with her divorce lawyer.

08:22.760 --> 08:25.445
Do you have his number?
My mom's gonna need one.

08:26.960 --> 08:29.531
Kendra!

08:35.240 --> 08:36.924
Shit.

08:42.240 --> 08:44.288
Wow.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.201
How was Houston?

08:49.280 --> 08:52.966
Just supplying diamonds for oil
men's mistresses.

08:54.840 --> 08:56.729
How's Avery?

08:56.800 --> 08:59.531
Oh, she's still in her room.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.290
She hates me.

09:01.360 --> 09:04.842
No, she doesn't hate you.
She hates both of us.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.004
Uh. I found this.

09:09.080 --> 09:10.605
Do you think she's smoking?

09:10.680 --> 09:12.648
I hope not.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.291
It's not just this.
There were cigarettes out by the pool.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.600
Really?

09:16.680 --> 09:17.920
Uh-huh.

09:21.360 --> 09:22.600
I'm worried about her.

09:22.680 --> 09:24.569
Yeah.

09:24.640 --> 09:26.529
Here.

09:30.200 --> 09:34.524
This guy's only in town tonight, otherwise
the whole deal, just, you know?

09:38.320 --> 09:40.527
You look so beautiful.

09:40.640 --> 09:42.642
I do?

09:42.720 --> 09:46.327
What I do, that I leave,
that I can't always be here,

09:46.400 --> 09:48.482
it's all for you and Avery.

09:48.560 --> 09:51.928
To take care of you.
You know that?

09:53.520 --> 09:55.045
I know.

10:09.280 --> 10:11.487
Hey. Hm?

10:11.560 --> 10:13.722
I have to go.

10:16.800 --> 10:19.201
I wonder how many times
this has to happen before

10:19.280 --> 10:23.888
I'm not really gonna care any more.

10:23.960 --> 10:26.167
What does that mean?

10:39.400 --> 10:40.731
Yes. Hello?

10:40.800 --> 10:42.006
Mr. Kyle Miller?

10:42.120 --> 10:43.645
Yes.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.484
Sheriffs Department,
Mr. Miller.

10:45.560 --> 10:48.962
May we come in to speak with you?

10:49.040 --> 10:50.724
What's this about?

10:50.800 --> 10:53.246
How many people are at
your house at this time?

10:53.320 --> 10:55.971
My wife and daughter and myself.
Is there a problem, oficer?

10:56.040 --> 10:57.963
Kyle, what's going on?

10:58.040 --> 11:00.168
Sir, we're talking to all
the families in the area

11:00.240 --> 11:03.005
because there 's been
a rash of burglaries.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.082
Get Avery.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.924
Mr. Miller?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.970
Yes, all right. All right.
Just- just a minute.

11:25.520 --> 11:27.648
Avery!

11:27.720 --> 11:29.131
Oh.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.806
Avery, come on, open up.

11:31.920 --> 11:34.207
Avery.

11:34.280 --> 11:36.567
Come on, don't be silly.

11:36.640 --> 11:39.405
Avery! Come on! It's locked!

11:39.480 --> 11:43.087
Well, will you just get her to open it?
I want her down here now.

11:43.160 --> 11:45.527
Yeah. Yeah.
Avery, come on!

11:57.320 --> 11:59.163
She's gone!

11:59.280 --> 12:05.481
Sarah, run!
Run, Sarah!

12:05.560 --> 12:07.642
Shut the fuck up.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.961
Don't fucking do anything.

12:10.080 --> 12:13.129
Get her!
Get after her!

12:13.200 --> 12:15.771
I'm will put a hole in you.

12:15.880 --> 12:18.850
Don't fucking look at me. Get the cash.

12:47.920 --> 12:49.524
I told you it was happening.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.489
What is happening is
you almost killed us.

12:51.560 --> 12:53.722
Do not embarrass me and
go acting your age.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.086
What age should do I act?

12:55.160 --> 12:56.525
Legal!

12:59.320 --> 13:00.924
What up, ladies?

13:01.000 --> 13:02.570
I'm glad you all could make it here.

13:02.640 --> 13:05.211
My name is Jake.
Welcome to my party.

13:05.280 --> 13:08.170
Hey, Jake. I, uh,
I invited them. Jake.

13:08.240 --> 13:11.687
Yeah! It's
all cool.

13:11.760 --> 13:14.366
Kendra.
Follow me, please.

13:14.480 --> 13:18.166
I would absolutely love to show you something.
Check this out.

13:18.240 --> 13:19.924
In your fucking knees.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.604
Face down.

13:27.480 --> 13:29.767
We need that in case security calls.

13:29.840 --> 13:33.208
Okay. Let's all get really clear
on one thing here. All right?

13:33.280 --> 13:36.045
This is my house now.
It's my house, it's my rules.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.565
Daddy's home!

13:37.640 --> 13:39.324
Kid's gone.

13:41.720 --> 13:46.931
So, do you have any idea where
your underage daughter is

13:47.000 --> 13:49.207
and when she 's coming back?

13:49.280 --> 13:52.090
No, I don't know.

13:52.160 --> 13:54.845
Don't you just love surprises?

13:54.920 --> 13:56.206
She'll be back.

13:56.280 --> 13:59.887
Hey, 15 minutes.
In and out.

13:59.960 --> 14:02.201
No bullshit.

14:02.320 --> 14:04.527
All right.
Cell phones on the floor, now!

14:04.600 --> 14:06.523
Now! Cell phones!

14:08.520 --> 14:09.726
I don't have one!

14:09.800 --> 14:11.006
Liar!

14:11.120 --> 14:12.326
I don't have one on me.

14:12.400 --> 14:13.890
You don't have one?

14:13.960 --> 14:16.088
All right.
We'll see about that.

14:16.160 --> 14:19.004
Shall we, Sarah? Spread.
Oh, that's a nice ass.

14:19.080 --> 14:20.411
Do not...

14:20.480 --> 14:22.164
No! No! No!

14:22.240 --> 14:24.368
Don't you ever fucking
do that again, Kyle.

14:24.440 --> 14:26.966
If I see a gun, if I see a hand,

14:27.040 --> 14:28.610
I will fucking put a hole in you.

14:28.720 --> 14:30.688
Do I make myself clear, asshole?

14:30.760 --> 14:33.001
Shut the fuck up!

14:33.080 --> 14:35.970
They're feisty.

14:38.600 --> 14:41.922
Okay. Get that.
Get it.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.004
Kill it.
And the rest, too.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.922
All right. Let's
try that alarm now.

14:56.040 --> 14:59.203
After all, we wanna know when
little Avery gets home, right?

14:59.280 --> 15:02.045
You'd be surprised the things
I know about you, Kyle,

15:02.120 --> 15:05.203
and what I don't know,
you're gonna tell me.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.570
Like, what's the alarm code?

15:10.800 --> 15:13.406
What's the alarm code?

15:16.240 --> 15:19.528
You know, Kyle, I'm sorry,
I couldn't hear you.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.921
What did you say the code was?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.002
I can't hear you!
What's the fucking code?

15:24.080 --> 15:25.127
774...

15:25.200 --> 15:27.885
65!
7465!

15:27.960 --> 15:30.770
7465? You sure
about that?

15:30.840 --> 15:32.922
Yes.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.606
All right. You sure about that?
You're sure about that.

15:35.680 --> 15:38.650
I just wanna be sure because we
really, really hate surprises.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.530
7465!

15:41.600 --> 15:43.523
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Wait! No!

15:43.600 --> 15:45.921
Wait! Wait! Wait!
No! No! What?

15:46.000 --> 15:50.005
What? You hear the cops?
You hear anything? You hear a siren?

15:50.080 --> 15:52.845
I don't hear a siren.
You know why I don't hear a siren?

15:52.920 --> 15:55.526
Because there are
two codes here, Kyle.

15:55.640 --> 16:00.362
One that's real and one that acts
real, only it calls the police!

16:00.480 --> 16:03.324
Now, we happen to know your code.

16:03.440 --> 16:06.046
And we happen to know a
lot about you, Kyle.

16:06.120 --> 16:08.361
Please don't fucking
underestimate us, okay?

16:08.440 --> 16:12.047
Don't waste your time. Get up. See?

16:12.120 --> 16:15.010
This is what we call a
little trust exercise, Kyle.

16:15.080 --> 16:18.004
Now, relationships are
essentially built on trust.

16:18.120 --> 16:21.249
And once that trust is broken,

16:21.320 --> 16:25.006
it's very, very hard to get back.

16:25.080 --> 16:27.003
Isn't that right, Sarah?

16:27.080 --> 16:29.048
What do you want from us?

16:29.120 --> 16:32.044
I don't know. Why don't we
start with everything you got?

16:33.680 --> 16:36.251
Old man has no idea I know the combo.

16:36.320 --> 16:38.448
Do you want some blow?

16:38.520 --> 16:40.204
See that?

16:40.280 --> 16:42.362
There's 100K in there
and a stash of cipro

16:42.480 --> 16:44.084
just in case the terrorists

16:44.160 --> 16:46.447
completely destroy
the financial universe

16:46.520 --> 16:49.808
and mail him some anthrax.
It's unbelievable.

16:49.880 --> 16:51.405
You want some of this?

16:51.480 --> 16:53.403
Oh, no. I'm okay.
Just gonna go see

16:53.480 --> 16:55.562
what Kendra 's doing
maybe or something.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.130
Look. I know.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.009
I like you, too. I do.

16:59.120 --> 17:03.091
And I know you just met
me, but I can tell.

17:03.160 --> 17:05.925
You want this.
You do.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.127
And, you know, maybe neither one of us

17:08.200 --> 17:10.964
exactly saw this night
going like this,

17:11.040 --> 17:14.442
but you gotta ask yourself, I mean,

17:14.520 --> 17:18.319
do you really want tonight to
be about what could've been?

17:18.400 --> 17:20.800
Huh?

17:25.800 --> 17:27.529
Dispatch.

17:27.599 --> 17:29.648
Yeah. I'd
like a taxi.

17:29.720 --> 17:31.449
One moment, please.

17:31.520 --> 17:33.921
Picking up at what address?

17:34.000 --> 17:35.490
Where are you going?

17:35.560 --> 17:37.289
Somewhere I can throw up.

17:37.360 --> 17:40.443
Well... I got
a bathroom.

17:41.880 --> 17:43.484
Watch out for the kid.

17:43.560 --> 17:45.130
Leave me!

17:45.200 --> 17:48.090
Baby, just do what he says, okay?

17:53.360 --> 17:55.601
You know what, Kyle?

17:55.720 --> 17:59.281
Isn't this a little bit obvious?
You have a safe behind your picture.

17:59.360 --> 18:01.169
It's-it's aesthetic.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.924
Aesthetic?

18:03.000 --> 18:05.241
It's not about hiding it from people.

18:05.320 --> 18:07.846
It's a... there's not
a giant safe staring...

18:07.920 --> 18:10.924
Ten minutes.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.890
What are we gonna do?

18:13.960 --> 18:15.644
You know, Kyle? I'm impressed with you.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.563
You have a Benelli
pointed at your forehead

18:17.640 --> 18:20.211
and you still have the
audacity to condescend to me.

18:20.280 --> 18:24.968
Your either really, really
stupid or you're suicidal.

18:25.080 --> 18:27.651
Come on, open the safe.

18:27.720 --> 18:30.121
Open the safe.

18:32.120 --> 18:33.610
Open it!

18:35.800 --> 18:38.565
Now, this doesn't have
to be hard, all right?

18:38.640 --> 18:42.122
Just get in there and open the safe.

18:42.200 --> 18:45.602
Hell, you can probably claim
whatever you get in insurance.

18:45.680 --> 18:49.048
You'll get the cash all back, so
it's a win-win situation, right?

18:50.840 --> 18:52.922
Now, the combination.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.571
No.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.800
No?

19:20.880 --> 19:23.247
No.

19:23.320 --> 19:25.209
One "no" is not an option, Kyle.

19:27.680 --> 19:30.968
Please. Don't make us
be obvious about this.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.644
I don't know it!
I don't know it!

19:32.720 --> 19:34.688
What do you expect to find?

19:34.760 --> 19:37.889
We know things about you, okay?
I told you that, asshole!

19:37.960 --> 19:40.804
We saw you sign for diamonds.
Lots of them!

19:40.920 --> 19:44.402
I know you've got diamonds in there
smaller than my pinkie Fingernail

19:44.480 --> 19:46.881
that are worth more than
a Porsche, all right?

19:46.960 --> 19:49.122
I don't give a shit what's in the safe

19:49.200 --> 19:52.124
as long as you fucking open it, so
I'm gonna ask you one more time

19:52.200 --> 19:56.444
really nicely.
Open the goddamn safe, pretty please.

19:56.520 --> 19:59.046
Please. Please! Kyle.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.204
Who's cutting them?

20:02.280 --> 20:04.362
You gotta be kidding me.

20:04.440 --> 20:08.684
These diamonds, who 's cutting them?

20:08.760 --> 20:11.684
Kyle Miller.

20:11.760 --> 20:14.240
You really don't wanna
get smart with me now.

20:14.320 --> 20:17.881
You really wanna stay as
stupid as fucking possible.

20:17.960 --> 20:20.008
I stay stupid, you go to jail.

20:20.080 --> 20:23.971
So, I assume you have someone
to deal with the inscriptions?

20:24.040 --> 20:26.202
Eight. Minutes.

20:26.280 --> 20:29.170
Tell me you thought this through.
You came here to steal diamonds.

20:29.240 --> 20:31.242
You must know something about them.

20:31.320 --> 20:33.527
What does it take to shut
this prick up, Sarah?

20:33.600 --> 20:35.807
Yes, I'll shut up, because
there's another way.

20:35.920 --> 20:38.241
You can learn about the
micro-laser inscriptions

20:38.320 --> 20:41.051
when you're being arrested for
trying to pass off stolen goods.

20:41.120 --> 20:42.884
We're wasting time.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.883
Wait. No. I wanna hear it.
I need to hear it.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.166
No more talking.

20:46.240 --> 20:48.447
No! Don't hurt him!

20:48.520 --> 20:51.569
Anyone with a jeweler's Loupe is gonna
know that the stones are stolen

20:51.640 --> 20:53.369
and who you stole them from.

20:53.480 --> 20:55.562
Every diamond on the market
in the United States

20:55.640 --> 20:58.041
is registered with the Gemological
Institute of America.

20:58.120 --> 21:00.487
The weight, the shape, the grade,

21:00.560 --> 21:03.131
fluorescence and ownership

21:03.240 --> 21:05.686
are documented, filed,
etched into the stone.

21:05.760 --> 21:08.127
You get caught trying
to pass off my diamonds

21:08.200 --> 21:11.841
how soon before they
connect you to my murder?

21:11.920 --> 21:13.843
Open the safe.
No one gets murdered.

21:13.960 --> 21:16.042
Wait. What's he
talking about?

21:16.120 --> 21:18.885
Just-just let him talk.
I need to hear this.

21:21.920 --> 21:25.208
The only way to sell stolen
diamonds is to change the shape,

21:25.280 --> 21:27.681
shave off the inscription.

21:27.760 --> 21:30.684
Even so, if you try to sell recur
diamonds without a certificate,

21:30.800 --> 21:34.930
the buyer's gonna know they're stolen,
he's gonna be the bell of your bought.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.482
And yes, yes, there are several
hundred thousand dollars

21:38.600 --> 21:41.843
worth of diamonds in this safe.
But how much do you think a bunch of, you know,

21:41.920 --> 21:44.844
pardon my French, hooligans
are gonna get for them

21:44.960 --> 21:48.646
assuming you can even find a buyer who's
interested in stolen goods to begin with?

21:48.720 --> 21:53.886
Huh? Ten thousand?? I doubt it.
Ten hundred? Maybe. Probably not!

21:54.000 --> 21:58.688
In your hands, they go back
to being nothing but rocks.

21:58.760 --> 22:01.366
Just-just pretty,
shiny little rocks.

22:01.440 --> 22:04.762
So, I'm gonna ask you again.

22:04.840 --> 22:06.763
Who's cutting them for you?

22:06.840 --> 22:09.366
Every minute we stay
past the first 20,

22:09.440 --> 22:12.410
ups our risk 10%, which is

22:12.480 --> 22:14.767
six minutes from right now.

22:14.840 --> 22:17.047
Kyle.

22:20.400 --> 22:23.244
Why are you telling us this?

22:23.360 --> 22:25.886
Because I'm that guy.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.083
I'm the one who can get the stones recut
without anyone tracing them to us.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.806
We'll be partners.
I'll sell the diamonds, give you the cash.

22:31.880 --> 22:33.962
Report them stolen,
claim the insurance.

22:34.080 --> 22:37.641
Everybody wins and everybody lives.

22:37.720 --> 22:39.529
That is fucking brilliant.

22:39.600 --> 22:41.967
Let me get this straight.
We take the diamonds

22:42.040 --> 22:44.486
and then we give them back to you?

22:44.560 --> 22:46.767
Look.
We do not need this asshole

22:46.840 --> 22:51.243
and whatever bullshit he is selling
because there is cash. Okay?

22:51.320 --> 22:56.087
I don't know how much but it's enough
to give this disk jocky a workout.

22:56.160 --> 22:59.482
It's enough to make us tonight's
fucking lottery winners.

22:59.560 --> 23:01.289
Fuck the diamonds.

23:01.400 --> 23:04.802
Let's get the cash and
get the fuck outta here.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.004
All right.

24:00.080 --> 24:02.003
You had your show.
You made your offer.

24:02.080 --> 24:04.321
I refuse.
Now, open the safe.

24:04.400 --> 24:07.802
You don't have any rope, handcuffs,
nothing to tie us up with.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.405
I know what you're going to do.

24:09.480 --> 24:11.084
Open the safe.

24:11.160 --> 24:13.527
No.

24:13.600 --> 24:15.841
You son of a bitch.

24:15.920 --> 24:18.924
You son of a bitch!

24:19.000 --> 24:20.570
Please. Please!

24:20.640 --> 24:23.007
Please. Please. Please.

24:23.080 --> 24:26.368
Just put the gun down.
Let her go and I'll open it.

24:26.440 --> 24:27.851
Four minutes.

24:27.920 --> 24:30.161
Do you have any last words, Sarah?

24:30.280 --> 24:32.851
Kyle, give them what they want.
Please. Open the safe!

24:32.920 --> 24:35.844
They'll kill us, Sarah.
They'll just kill us if I do.

24:35.920 --> 24:38.127
It's called trust!

24:38.200 --> 24:40.931
Okay? Trust me, Kyle.
Trust me.

24:41.040 --> 24:46.171
And trust that I will fucking
kill her, right now if you don't!

24:46.240 --> 24:47.765
You promised me!

24:47.880 --> 24:50.121
Stay there! Just open the goddamn safe!

24:50.200 --> 24:52.009
If you let her go!

24:52.080 --> 24:54.367
That lock is the only
reason we're still alive.

24:54.440 --> 24:57.922
I open it, we lose leverage.
We lose leverage, we die.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.731
I want you to look at this
very pretty face here, okay?

25:00.800 --> 25:04.361
Now, can you imagine what
a 125 gram hollow point

25:04.480 --> 25:07.609
is gonna do to this?
It's gonna fucking destroy it, all right?

25:07.680 --> 25:10.251
We are moments away!
How about that for leverage?

25:10.360 --> 25:12.647
This is a negotiation.

25:12.760 --> 25:15.809
You have the power to take our lives,
but I have the power to make you rich.

25:15.880 --> 25:18.121
Let her take the car and
drive away and I'll do that.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.929
I'll open the safe and make you rich.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.526
Oh, her? You sure
she's worth it, Kyle?

25:22.600 --> 25:24.762
A million dollars?
Yes, that's right, kid!

25:24.840 --> 25:26.922
You did it!
You hit the mother load!

25:27.000 --> 25:29.651
You saw me sign for a
million with your own eyes.

25:29.720 --> 25:31.882
And it's right there just inches away.

25:31.960 --> 25:35.009
All you have to do
is just let my wife go!

25:35.080 --> 25:37.401
And then, come on down and grab it!

25:37.480 --> 25:38.481
Come on! Elias!

25:38.560 --> 25:39.800
No!

25:39.880 --> 25:41.928
No! No! No!

25:42.040 --> 25:44.930
Of all the stupid mistakes, that
man just about said your name.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.402
So you get your people in order!
You let my wife leave.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.847
And then I'll give you what you want.

25:50.920 --> 25:53.446
Hey, go get the magic wand.

26:14.440 --> 26:17.011
Succinylcholine.

26:17.080 --> 26:18.809
It's a paralytic.

26:18.880 --> 26:20.962
On the operating table

26:21.040 --> 26:24.647
it makes you think that someone
else is getting all cut up

26:24.720 --> 26:27.883
instead of you.
Now, it's a hell of a kick

26:27.960 --> 26:29.610
and this much would kill you,

26:29.680 --> 26:32.286
but with Papa Bear and Mama Bear

26:32.400 --> 26:35.882
and little Baby Bear,
it's just about right.

26:35.960 --> 26:38.930
It'll knock you flat,
give you a hell of a ride

26:39.000 --> 26:41.162
but it won't kill you.

26:41.240 --> 26:46.644
So this is the rope, the handcuffs

26:46.720 --> 26:49.007
which I have to say, Kyle,

26:49.080 --> 26:51.765
are a little bit kinky,
don't you think?

26:54.480 --> 26:56.767
But he was good,
though. Huh?

26:56.840 --> 26:58.330
Wasn't he good?

26:58.400 --> 27:00.368
You are a piece of work.

27:00.440 --> 27:02.488
"Get your people
in order!"

27:02.560 --> 27:04.801
The man's a born deal maker.

27:24.400 --> 27:25.845
One minute.

27:28.240 --> 27:30.846
Come on, hero.
You open that big guy up, okay?

27:30.960 --> 27:33.691
I'm gonna stick you with this shit.
You'll fall asleep.

27:33.760 --> 27:35.728
By the time you wake
up, we're in Mexico.

27:35.840 --> 27:39.162
This is all a bad
dream with insurance.

27:39.240 --> 27:42.403
I want you to listen to me,
listen to me really good, okay?

27:42.520 --> 27:46.764
You may have noticed that I don't really
have control over the big guy, okay?

27:46.840 --> 27:50.208
So you have to ask yourself why
I'm gonna bring someone like that

27:50.280 --> 27:54.729
to a job like this.
Maybe I don't have a choice, all right?

27:54.800 --> 27:57.849
Now, I don't wanna
hurt you or your wife.

27:57.920 --> 28:00.241
But he does and he will.

28:00.320 --> 28:03.051
I'm not giving you anything
until after you let her go.

28:03.160 --> 28:05.208
Come on, man, don't
do this to yourself.

28:08.400 --> 28:10.323
Time's up.

28:13.360 --> 28:15.124
Ugh!

28:22.880 --> 28:24.689
Kyle! Kyle!

28:26.600 --> 28:30.446
Leave her alone!
Leave her the fuck alone.

28:30.560 --> 28:32.130
What the fuck are you doing?

28:32.200 --> 28:34.009
Keep his dirty fucking
hands off of her.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.605
You agreed to shut your mouth.

28:35.680 --> 28:37.569
Please, help me.
Help us.

28:37.640 --> 28:40.689
You told me nobody was gonna touch her.
You promised!

28:40.760 --> 28:42.888
You're gonna shut your fucking mouth.

28:42.960 --> 28:44.291
Did you take your pills?

28:44.360 --> 28:46.328
Yes, I took my fucking pills!

28:46.400 --> 28:49.404
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Fuck you! Fuck you!

28:49.480 --> 28:52.290
If you touch her,
I will fucking kill you.

28:58.200 --> 28:59.884
F Fuck!

29:34.440 --> 29:37.489
Well, the contractor
keeps calling and calling.

29:37.560 --> 29:40.245
I don't know what you
want me to do here, Kyle.

29:40.320 --> 29:44.848
Come one. This is
what you wanted.

29:44.920 --> 29:47.730
I thought we were happier
in the old house.

29:47.800 --> 29:50.485
Don't yell at me.

29:50.600 --> 29:53.809
I was just asking, Kyle. What do you...

29:53.880 --> 29:58.090
Okay. Okay.
I'll talk to you later.

29:58.160 --> 30:00.003
Bye.

30:11.680 --> 30:13.728
Oh.

30:13.800 --> 30:15.689
Um, no, I'm sorry, I...

30:15.760 --> 30:18.366
I couldn't help overhear.

30:18.440 --> 30:20.442
Are you-you okay?

30:20.520 --> 30:22.921
Yeah. Yeah,
yeah, I'm fine.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.684
Okay.

30:24.800 --> 30:26.928
Did you design this whole
place by yourself?

30:27.000 --> 30:30.004
The house? Yeah. I did.

30:30.080 --> 30:32.731
You are very talented.

30:32.800 --> 30:34.609
Thank you.

30:34.680 --> 30:36.842
It's a little bigger
than we needed, but...

30:36.920 --> 30:39.969
Well, if you're gonna
dream, dream big. Right?

30:40.040 --> 30:41.963
Yeah.

30:42.040 --> 30:44.247
I'm all finished here today, so.

30:44.360 --> 30:45.691
Well, thank you.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.444
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

31:12.320 --> 31:13.810
Take that off!

31:13.880 --> 31:15.484
Oh, did I remind you of someone?

31:15.600 --> 31:17.648
Take it off!

31:17.720 --> 31:20.121
It's not yours.

31:20.200 --> 31:22.407
It is now.

31:28.920 --> 31:30.649
Are you sure this is
the right location?

31:30.720 --> 31:32.802
Uh-huh.

31:32.920 --> 31:35.685
Look, if it's about the money, I'll
take you where you want to go.

31:35.760 --> 31:38.047
No, no, my my house
is right here. I'm fine.

31:38.120 --> 31:39.246
You sure?

31:39.320 --> 31:40.845
Uh-huh. Thank you.

31:43.160 --> 31:45.083
No. No. No.

31:45.160 --> 31:47.401
I'm taking Sarah for a
little walk with me.

31:47.480 --> 31:48.481
No!

31:48.560 --> 31:49.925
Sarah!

31:50.000 --> 31:51.081
Kyle!

31:51.160 --> 31:52.810
Come with me.

31:52.880 --> 31:54.325
Help!

31:56.760 --> 32:02.369
You know, you don't see a lot of
biometrics on home security systems.

32:02.480 --> 32:03.970
Fingerprint scanner?

32:04.040 --> 32:06.008
Ugh.

32:12.440 --> 32:16.729
You know, you're gonna put your thumb
on that thing sooner or later.

32:19.400 --> 32:25.169
The only question is, whether it
will still be attached to your body.

32:36.440 --> 32:39.364
Serve me.
Serve me.

32:39.440 --> 32:42.171
Pour me some wine.
I want you to serve me.

32:42.240 --> 32:44.129
Would you serve me?

32:45.560 --> 32:47.562
Would you serve me?

32:47.640 --> 32:49.449
Like you served my baby brother?

32:49.520 --> 32:50.965
Huh?

32:51.040 --> 32:53.884
Yes, you recognized
him. I saw you.

32:53.960 --> 32:55.246
No.

32:55.320 --> 32:56.560
Yes.

32:56.640 --> 32:58.404
No, I didn't.

32:58.480 --> 33:00.482
Drop the fucking thing.
Don't even try.

33:00.560 --> 33:03.245
Drop the fucking knife or I'll
bite your fucking ear off.

33:03.320 --> 33:05.288
You know why we're here, Sarah,

33:05.360 --> 33:07.488
because you fucked around
with my little brother.

33:07.600 --> 33:10.729
And for that reason, I have to tell
you something. You're gonna die.

33:10.840 --> 33:14.447
And I think you know deep down
inside you that you deserve to die.

33:14.520 --> 33:17.091
And I need you to tell
me "I deserve to die."

33:17.160 --> 33:18.685
You go to hell.

33:18.760 --> 33:20.967
Not go to hell, Sarah.
Not go to hell.

33:21.040 --> 33:23.202
I'm not doing this for me, Sarah.

33:23.320 --> 33:26.802
It's for you. There's a reason they
send priests to guys on death row.

33:26.920 --> 33:31.084
It's their last chance for moral clarity.
Let's get really clear on one thing here.

33:31.160 --> 33:34.004
Only you can save your husband

33:34.080 --> 33:37.527
and your little girl.
We will come back for your little fucking girl

33:37.600 --> 33:41.127
and she doesn't deserve
to die, does she?

33:41.200 --> 33:44.283
No. No.

33:44.360 --> 33:47.648
So, I need you to say it.

33:47.720 --> 33:49.210
What?

33:49.280 --> 33:53.285
I need you to say it. I deserve...

33:53.360 --> 33:55.203
I..

33:55.280 --> 33:56.441
Say it.

33:56.520 --> 33:59.171
Say it.

33:59.240 --> 34:01.083
I..

34:02.400 --> 34:04.767
deserve

34:04.840 --> 34:09.083
to die. Say it, Sarah.

34:09.159 --> 34:12.130
I deserve

34:12.199 --> 34:13.884
to die.

34:17.040 --> 34:20.647
Good girl.
Good girl.

34:20.719 --> 34:24.281
Now, you're gonna help
me get that money, okay?

34:24.360 --> 34:25.600
How do I do that?

34:25.679 --> 34:27.762
I think you'll find a way.

34:27.840 --> 34:30.605
And I will make sure that your husband

34:30.679 --> 34:34.321
and your little girl are taken care of.
And they will never have to know...

34:34.400 --> 34:35.889
You promise?

34:35.960 --> 34:37.928
Yes. And I think
you'll find a way

34:38.000 --> 34:41.208
'cause I think you know your
way around men, don't you?

34:41.280 --> 34:43.089
Now, you come with me.

34:44.480 --> 34:46.369
I'd prefer not to make a mess.

34:46.480 --> 34:47.719
But I do when I have to.

34:47.800 --> 34:49.688
Nothing personal.

34:49.760 --> 34:51.569
I'm a collector, you see?

34:51.639 --> 34:53.641
I'm here to collect on a debt.

34:53.719 --> 34:55.051
Ugh!

34:55.120 --> 34:56.884
Ah!

34:56.960 --> 34:58.610
Hey, I don't owe you anything.

34:58.680 --> 35:01.001
Who said it was your debt?

35:01.080 --> 35:02.161
Sarah! Sarah!

35:02.240 --> 35:04.368
No. Kyle. Yeah.

35:06.920 --> 35:09.810
Tell me where they are.

35:09.920 --> 35:11.410
Tell me where they are!

35:11.480 --> 35:13.369
Mom? Mom?

35:13.440 --> 35:15.090
Run, Avery!

35:15.160 --> 35:16.525
Run, Avery!

35:16.600 --> 35:19.649
Avery!

35:30.960 --> 35:32.962
Shit.

35:37.400 --> 35:40.290
Where did you go? Huh?
Where did you go? Sweetie?

35:40.360 --> 35:42.249
Did we scare you?

35:44.880 --> 35:47.087
I promise we won't hurt you.

35:53.920 --> 35:56.082
Where the fuck are you?

36:01.440 --> 36:02.771
All right.
Come on.

36:02.840 --> 36:04.205
No!

36:04.280 --> 36:08.126
Avery! Avery!
Oh, my God!

36:08.200 --> 36:12.000
Avery! You shit
fucking animals!

36:15.800 --> 36:17.404
It's all right.

36:17.480 --> 36:19.050
Sweetie.

36:19.120 --> 36:21.248
Dad.

36:21.320 --> 36:25.405
Av... Avery.

36:27.560 --> 36:30.609
It's all right, baby.
It's all right. I got you.

36:37.280 --> 36:39.965
Okay, man. Okay, okay. Hey. Hey.

36:40.040 --> 36:41.849
You know what? You did good. All right?

36:41.920 --> 36:44.002
You did good.
You held your ground.

36:44.120 --> 36:47.681
Now it's just your bad luck that
your little girl showed up, okay?

36:47.760 --> 36:50.331
I'm glad that you feel
this way, though.

36:50.400 --> 36:52.402
Now you know how I feel, man.

36:52.520 --> 36:54.443
I'm a family man, too, okay?

36:54.520 --> 36:56.409
That's why we're here.

36:56.480 --> 36:58.767
My Mom...

36:58.840 --> 37:00.968
My Mom got herself beat up every night

37:01.040 --> 37:03.611
by her drunken, asshole husband.

37:03.680 --> 37:06.251
Because she thought that
if she was getting beat up,

37:06.320 --> 37:08.163
we weren't getting beat up.

37:08.240 --> 37:10.766
And she got beat and she
got beat and she got beat

37:10.840 --> 37:12.922
until she got renal failure.

37:13.080 --> 37:17.324
You know what that means?
She needs a new fucking kidney, Kyle,

37:17.400 --> 37:18.970
which is where you come in.

37:19.040 --> 37:21.122
I got a broker that's gonna get us one

37:21.200 --> 37:24.249
but it's gonna cost us
$180,000, all right?

37:24.320 --> 37:28.325
So, I have a choice.
I have to leave here with a $180,000

37:28.440 --> 37:33.048
or a new kidney, and I don't care
which, but I have to tell you, man,

37:33.120 --> 37:36.249
the younger the kidney, the better.

37:36.320 --> 37:37.765
You're full of shit.

37:37.840 --> 37:39.968
No, I'm not, man.
Why do you think

37:40.040 --> 37:44.125
I brought the guy with the
knife and the tranquilizer?

37:44.240 --> 37:47.005
Now, for her sake

37:47.080 --> 37:49.242
I'm gonna ask you one more time

37:49.320 --> 37:52.529
open the fucking safe.

37:56.400 --> 37:59.449
Open the safe.

38:01.120 --> 38:02.565
No!

38:02.640 --> 38:05.371
Motherfucker!
You're a motherfucker!

38:05.440 --> 38:09.081
I'll shoot you up with this
and you'll never wake up.

38:09.160 --> 38:11.447
Isn't that what you said?
So you let my daughter go.

38:11.520 --> 38:14.205
I swear to God I'm gonna do it.

38:14.280 --> 38:16.681
Somebody shoot her!

38:16.760 --> 38:20.003
Five! Go away. Come on, let her go.

38:20.080 --> 38:21.923
You're all gonna fucking die with me.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.526
Come on, Avery.
Go on. Two!

38:29.160 --> 38:31.686
No one's killing your girl.

38:31.760 --> 38:34.047
Nobody's killing her.

38:34.120 --> 38:37.010
Avery get up.
Come on, you gotta run. Run!

38:37.080 --> 38:39.162
Don't you fucking touch her!

38:39.240 --> 38:42.050
Kyle! Run!

38:42.120 --> 38:43.326
What the fuck are you doing?

38:43.400 --> 38:44.811
What needs to be done.

38:44.880 --> 38:46.723
Avery, baby, I need you to run.

38:46.800 --> 38:49.167
Run, baby. Run
as fast as you can.

38:49.240 --> 38:50.571
Go! Go!

38:50.680 --> 38:52.125
I can't, Mom.

38:52.200 --> 38:54.487
You can do it.
You can do it, baby.

38:54.600 --> 38:57.365
Run! Run!

39:00.680 --> 39:03.126
Now, drop the needle, open the safe,

39:03.200 --> 39:05.567
or I bring her back.

39:05.640 --> 39:07.324
Open it, Kyle.

39:07.400 --> 39:08.686
Sarah...

39:08.760 --> 39:11.843
Open the safe!

39:11.920 --> 39:16.244
Do it! Or we can all die because
I don't give a fuck anymore!

39:20.000 --> 39:21.365
A Ha boy.

39:38.760 --> 39:39.841
Let go.

39:39.920 --> 39:41.445
No!

39:41.520 --> 39:43.045
No, no, no, no, no!

39:43.120 --> 39:45.691
No fucking way, you motherfucker!

39:45.760 --> 39:48.491
You motherfucker!
Where is it?

39:48.560 --> 39:53.043
Shut up. Shut up.
Just shut the fuck up!

39:55.000 --> 39:57.162
Where is it, baby?
You said...

39:57.240 --> 39:58.651
Shut up!

39:58.720 --> 40:02.850
Okay, let me think.
Let me think.

40:02.960 --> 40:05.725
Kyle, put your hand against the wall.

40:05.840 --> 40:09.003
Ah! Oh, fuck!

40:09.080 --> 40:10.366
No! No!

40:10.440 --> 40:12.329
No! Get off!

40:14.400 --> 40:17.006
Damn you!

40:17.080 --> 40:18.844
Fuck!

40:18.920 --> 40:20.809
It's the second time
you lied to me, Kyle...

40:20.880 --> 40:24.043
There's not gonna be a third time.
Where's the money?

40:26.440 --> 40:28.886
I have no money.

40:28.960 --> 40:30.325
Bullshit.

40:30.400 --> 40:32.448
Fuck that.
Where's the stuff?

40:32.520 --> 40:36.206
I put it all in my house, in my family.

40:36.280 --> 40:40.171
No, no, no, no! No fucking way
he spent all of that. Okay?

40:40.240 --> 40:43.084
That was too much fucking cash, Kyle!
I saw...

40:43.160 --> 40:44.650
I got it, I got it! I got it!

40:44.720 --> 40:46.882
Where's the fucking money?

40:46.960 --> 40:49.486
There is no fucking money.

40:49.560 --> 40:52.450
Everything is mortgaged.
It's all borrowed.

40:52.520 --> 40:55.251
We never owned this house-
It owned us! We 're broke...

40:55.320 --> 40:57.527
Bullshit!! Bullshit!!

40:57.640 --> 41:00.246
It was a family business.
I'm not family. Honey, they fired me.

41:00.320 --> 41:03.051
They found someone
that could do it cheaper.

41:03.120 --> 41:06.966
I-I was just trying to save something
before the bank took it all.

41:07.040 --> 41:08.280
No. No.
I saw you!

41:08.400 --> 41:10.084
Yeah, we saw you, asshole!

41:10.160 --> 41:12.367
Yeah, you saw me, fucker!
I mean, I just drive

41:12.440 --> 41:16.047
and hustle and drive and
try to make some money.

41:20.120 --> 41:21.724
Honey, I'm sorry.

41:53.480 --> 41:56.404
Oh.

41:56.480 --> 41:58.608
What's all
this, then? Huh?

41:58.680 --> 42:00.523
What's all this?

42:00.600 --> 42:02.602
Where's the money, Kyle?

42:02.680 --> 42:06.287
Oh, my God! I have no money.
I have no money!

42:06.360 --> 42:09.489
Hey! These are diamonds.

42:09.600 --> 42:13.082
Each one of these is a diamond, so
you're gonna tell me where they are.

42:13.160 --> 42:15.561
Have a look at it.
Tell me where they are!

42:15.640 --> 42:18.644
How am I supposed to read
without my glasses, asshole?

42:21.400 --> 42:24.006
Where is it? Hm?

42:24.080 --> 42:25.889
Where is the money?

42:25.960 --> 42:28.167
You tell me where each of these are!

42:28.240 --> 42:30.049
Uh, this one's in Houston, I think.

42:30.120 --> 42:34.364
Sarah. Sarah.
I'm not asking for me, okay?

42:34.440 --> 42:36.647
I am asking for us.

42:36.720 --> 42:40.406
Uh, Albany, maybe... I don't know!
I don't have these!

42:40.480 --> 42:44.610
I never owned them!
I'm a middle man living on credit.

42:44.720 --> 42:47.724
Baby, what's he talking about?
What are we gonna do?

42:47.800 --> 42:50.644
You! You are a fucker!

42:50.720 --> 42:54.645
You said that there was millions here.
This is your fault!

42:54.720 --> 42:58.042
Fucking amateurs.
Look what I found, huh?

42:58.120 --> 43:00.521
No!

43:00.640 --> 43:02.642
Baby, baby, did they hurt you?

43:02.720 --> 43:04.563
What the hell has she got
to do with any of this?

43:04.640 --> 43:06.642
Well, yeah. What do you call it?

43:06.720 --> 43:08.563
You call it leverage, right?

43:08.640 --> 43:11.803
If it's a kidney you want,
then take mine, ass fuck!

43:11.880 --> 43:13.644
Kyle!

43:13.720 --> 43:16.087
Really? You're
really ready?

43:16.160 --> 43:18.527
Yeah. Do it, shithole!

43:20.000 --> 43:22.526
You ready for that?
Now this knife,

43:22.600 --> 43:25.365
does it have to be
sterilized or is it good?

43:25.440 --> 43:27.841
You might want to turn away.
Get some ice!

43:27.920 --> 43:30.526
Okay. That's the way
you want it, yuppie.

43:30.600 --> 43:31.840
Are you...

43:31.960 --> 43:33.166
Ugh.

43:33.240 --> 43:35.163
Don't look,
Avery. Avery!

43:35.240 --> 43:38.403
Okay, the kidney's on this side, right?
Brace yourself.

43:40.480 --> 43:42.881
Two. Three!

43:45.000 --> 43:46.809
You thought I want your kidney?

43:46.880 --> 43:49.884
My Mom, she died because
she was a fat ass drunk.

43:49.960 --> 43:53.123
It's okay. It's okay.

43:57.880 --> 43:59.928
I'm still here.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.844
I don't know.
Let me ask him.

44:02.920 --> 44:04.649
How're we doing?

44:04.720 --> 44:06.484
Under control.

44:06.560 --> 44:10.884
It's under control.
That's what Elias says...

44:11.000 --> 44:13.810
We'll be there.

44:15.280 --> 44:17.567
You got an hour.

44:17.640 --> 44:20.405
No. No. No, no, no, no.

44:20.480 --> 44:22.403
No. No, baby.
He's lying.

44:22.480 --> 44:24.448
Fucking look at this place.

44:24.520 --> 44:27.171
Look at it. They're fucking rich.
You're lying!

44:27.240 --> 44:29.527
You are lying!

44:31.120 --> 44:33.202
Get that girl under control.

44:33.280 --> 44:35.442
You said you have
things under control?

44:35.520 --> 44:38.922
Get it under control.

44:44.320 --> 44:47.290
We're not the only hostages here.

44:47.360 --> 44:49.761
Fuck you.

44:57.320 --> 44:59.209
Help us. Please.

45:02.720 --> 45:04.085
Help us.

45:08.520 --> 45:11.171
Baby, will you stop it? Stop.

45:13.920 --> 45:16.127
It's not... You're not
fucking helping me.

45:16.200 --> 45:18.441
Baby, there's a fucking car.
It's a Porsche.

45:18.520 --> 45:20.443
We can get money for the Porsche.

45:20.520 --> 45:23.126
What are we gonna do with it?
Have a fucking yard sale?

45:23.240 --> 45:24.969
I don't know, baby.
I'm really scared.

45:25.040 --> 45:26.804
I just wanna get out of here.

45:26.880 --> 45:29.201
I wanna go, too.
But you're safer here with me.

45:29.280 --> 45:31.123
They can't get you
here. All right?

45:31.200 --> 45:33.009
Tye is gonna fucking kill you.

45:33.080 --> 45:34.491
Don't worry about
Tye. I got Tye.

45:34.560 --> 45:36.608
Please. You can't
die on me, okay?

45:36.680 --> 45:38.728
I'm not gonna die.
Do I look like I'm gonna die?

45:38.840 --> 45:40.444
I'm not gonna fucking die.

45:40.520 --> 45:43.683
I don't know what I'll
do without you, baby.

45:43.800 --> 45:46.406
Please, this is fucking wrong.
Let's just go.

45:46.480 --> 45:48.881
We can be in Mexico.
At least, we can, we can...

45:48.960 --> 45:50.246
We can just get away...

45:50.320 --> 45:52.163
No one's running.

45:52.240 --> 45:54.481
No. No. No.
No. No. No.

45:54.560 --> 45:58.326
No, man.
No one's running.

45:58.440 --> 46:00.681
Nobody's running anywhere.

46:04.280 --> 46:07.090
Tape 'em up. These two. Not Sarah.

46:07.200 --> 46:10.204
You're gonna show me where you're
hiding this little number.

46:10.280 --> 46:11.520
Hey! Fucker!

46:13.120 --> 46:16.761
You heard him.
Get up.

46:16.840 --> 46:18.683
Get up.

46:18.760 --> 46:21.764
Dad. Please.

46:21.880 --> 46:23.484
Dad!

46:26.880 --> 46:29.201
Oh, yeah.
How much is this thing worth?

46:29.280 --> 46:30.645
You promised me.
We had a deal.

46:30.720 --> 46:32.324
What's this thing worth?

46:32.400 --> 46:34.971
We had a deal.
You would let my family go.

46:35.040 --> 46:36.724
No. You
stay here.

46:36.800 --> 46:38.848
You take her downstairs.
I'll care for her.

46:38.920 --> 46:40.809
Please.

46:40.880 --> 46:43.486
It's gonna be fine.
Take your fucking hands off me. Go.

46:43.560 --> 46:46.131
Go! Go.

46:50.920 --> 46:54.402
What is he gonna do to her?

46:54.480 --> 46:58.610
They're just getting
the necklace, honey.

46:58.680 --> 47:01.331
You know what they're
talking about in there.

47:01.400 --> 47:02.640
They're gonna kill us.

47:02.720 --> 47:05.564
So what?
Shut up.

47:05.640 --> 47:07.642
They're gonna kill us.

47:13.120 --> 47:16.283
Now, you know what happens next, right?

47:18.120 --> 47:20.566
I'm begging you.
Please don't hurt my daughter.

47:20.640 --> 47:22.369
Please. She's just
a little girl.

47:22.440 --> 47:24.010
She's not a little girl.

47:24.080 --> 47:26.401
Please. Please? Maybe you have a child.

47:26.480 --> 47:28.960
Are you a mother?
Do you have a child?

47:29.040 --> 47:30.963
Maybe you know what I'm talking about?

47:31.040 --> 47:32.610
You don't know shit about me!

47:32.680 --> 47:34.967
Hey! All right. All right. I got her.

47:37.360 --> 47:40.091
They'll kill us. That's what he said.
He's gonna kills us.

47:40.160 --> 47:41.286
No, he's not!

47:43.720 --> 47:45.961
I'm won't let him.
He's not gonna touch you.

47:46.040 --> 47:47.565
What is she saying to you?

47:47.640 --> 47:49.927
Shut up!

47:50.000 --> 47:52.526
I have a lighter in my right pocket.

47:52.640 --> 47:54.290
Can you find it?

47:57.280 --> 47:59.089
Can-can you do it?

48:03.680 --> 48:06.763
Can you do it?
Can you find it?

48:06.840 --> 48:08.729
Yeah.

48:08.800 --> 48:10.882
Okay. Put it-put it
in my hand.

48:12.920 --> 48:15.730
I'm going to help you.
I'm going to help you, okay?

48:15.800 --> 48:18.406
You'll save her?
You'll protect Avery?

48:18.480 --> 48:21.006
You'll help her?
You'll get her out of here alive?

48:39.280 --> 48:41.248
Okay, this-this
is gonna hurt.

48:50.280 --> 48:51.691
I need to tape you up.

48:53.040 --> 48:55.486
I'm gonna tape you, okay?

48:58.920 --> 49:01.685
If you save her, I'll do
anything, anything you want.

49:01.760 --> 49:03.967
You know that,
don't you? Huh?

49:04.040 --> 49:06.122
Don't listen to that bitch! Don't.

49:06.200 --> 49:08.965
I know you're not like them, are you?

49:09.040 --> 49:12.931
Can-can you...
Are you a bit loose?

49:13.000 --> 49:16.482
Yeah. Yeah.

49:16.560 --> 49:18.801
Babe, where are you?

49:18.880 --> 49:21.804
You up to this?

49:21.880 --> 49:24.804
Good. 'Cause you made a fucking mess.
It's time to clean up.

49:41.680 --> 49:45.127
You Just get her out
of here alive and I'm yours.

49:45.200 --> 49:47.248
What the fuck are you doing?

49:49.560 --> 49:51.961
What the fuck are you doing, huh?

49:52.040 --> 49:53.644
Where's your fucking mask?

49:53.760 --> 49:56.366
He has his mask off.
Don't look. Don't look.

49:56.440 --> 50:00.331
Close your eyes. Just close your eyes.
Don't look at him.

50:00.400 --> 50:02.129
Look down.
Look down.

50:02.200 --> 50:04.362
You got what you needed, all right?
Let's go.

50:04.480 --> 50:07.086
Yeah. Okay, you go and
get the security tapes.

50:07.160 --> 50:08.924
I'll finish up in here, okay?

50:09.000 --> 50:10.525
You'll finish up in here?

50:10.600 --> 50:14.571
No. Nobody fucking
touches her, okay?

50:16.440 --> 50:18.363
Okay. All right.

50:18.440 --> 50:21.569
Or the kid.

50:25.080 --> 50:27.447
Okay, go get the girl, Pet, now.

50:27.520 --> 50:29.488
Run. Run. Run.

50:29.560 --> 50:31.164
All right?

50:31.240 --> 50:33.288
I swear to God...

50:33.360 --> 50:34.885
Go.

50:38.840 --> 50:41.127
You hurt her and I will kill you.

50:41.200 --> 50:43.009
I'll kill you!

50:43.080 --> 50:44.650
Do I look scared?

50:44.720 --> 50:46.051
Oh.

50:53.440 --> 50:55.010
What?

50:57.520 --> 50:59.602
On your knees.

51:31.240 --> 51:34.005
You're a stupid asshole, you
brought this on yourself.

51:34.080 --> 51:36.367
I didn't want it
like this. Okay?

51:36.440 --> 51:38.124
So you can save yourselves,

51:38.240 --> 51:40.447
but how much do you care
about your daughter?

51:40.520 --> 51:41.806
You can still save her.

51:41.880 --> 51:43.370
I told you.
We have nothing.

51:43.440 --> 51:44.885
Okay.

51:44.960 --> 51:46.689
That's the way you wanna play it.

51:46.760 --> 51:48.410
I'm gonna take the necklace.

51:48.480 --> 51:50.482
I'm gonna leave three bodies.

51:52.960 --> 51:56.646
If you're gonna kill me, why don't you
fucking look me in the eye, you coward!

51:56.720 --> 51:58.609
It's fake.

51:58.680 --> 52:00.045
Come again?

52:00.120 --> 52:03.841
The necklace.
It's fake.

52:03.920 --> 52:07.003
The stones are cubic zirconia.

52:07.080 --> 52:09.606
Ninety-nine bucks a pop
on the shopping network.

52:09.680 --> 52:11.569
Bullshit.

52:15.240 --> 52:16.571
Fuck you.

52:20.280 --> 52:22.442
Are you okay?

52:22.520 --> 52:25.808
Don't fucking worry
about me, honey, okay?

52:27.800 --> 52:31.202
You sure? Because I know where
my Mom hides the Vicodin.

52:34.800 --> 52:36.962
Do you expect me to believe

52:37.040 --> 52:39.202
that you bought your wife fakes?

52:39.280 --> 52:44.002
I sold the real ones.
That's a copy.

52:44.080 --> 52:47.482
Do you know anything

52:47.600 --> 52:51.366
about the etymology
of the word "diamond?"

52:51.480 --> 52:54.290
Why don't you educate me, asshole?

52:54.400 --> 52:58.724
It comes from the Greek
adamas meaning "unbreakable"

52:58.800 --> 53:02.247
'cause real ones are so hard

53:02.320 --> 53:05.927
they won't break.

53:10.560 --> 53:13.484
They won't break.

53:13.560 --> 53:15.130
All right.

53:15.200 --> 53:16.929
We're done.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.526
No!

53:19.600 --> 53:24.083
Hey, man, it's still my show!

53:24.160 --> 53:26.083
It's still my show.

53:26.160 --> 53:29.448
Then wrap it up.

53:40.040 --> 53:43.169
Does that look like the hardest
substance in the world to you?

53:46.960 --> 53:49.804
You know what?
This doesn't save you.

53:55.920 --> 53:58.048
Hey, Kyle.

53:58.160 --> 54:02.006
You know, your loving wife,
she fucked my baby brother.

54:02.080 --> 54:04.367
That's why we're here.

54:04.440 --> 54:06.920
That's why we picked you.

54:10.440 --> 54:14.240
Kyle, he's lying.
Look at me.

54:16.080 --> 54:18.242
It's up there.
You want me to get it?

54:18.320 --> 54:21.483
What? And untie you?
How dumb do you think I am, huh?

54:26.640 --> 54:29.450
Stupid bitch!
You fucking bitch!

54:29.520 --> 54:30.851
Get that tweaking bitch.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.729
Ugh.

55:10.080 --> 55:12.765
I'm getting a lot of money to do this.

55:12.840 --> 55:14.285
And you...

55:14.360 --> 55:16.203
Ah!

55:16.280 --> 55:19.443
You, I'm gonna do it for free.
You, I'm gonna enjoy.

55:19.520 --> 55:21.887
Ah!

55:38.560 --> 55:40.688
Hello?

55:40.760 --> 55:43.411
Good evening, sir.
This is Guardalert Security.

55:43.480 --> 55:45.721
Uh, we're gonna have to call you back.

55:56.880 --> 56:01.010
Am I talking now,
Kyle? Huh?

56:01.080 --> 56:03.686
Huh? No more
bullshit, Kyle?

56:03.760 --> 56:05.489
I don't hear you talking.

56:16.800 --> 56:20.521
You know what else they use
that needle for? Huh? Huh?

56:20.600 --> 56:23.206
Lethal injection. Yeah.

56:23.280 --> 56:27.080
See? It paralyzes you
but you stay conscious.

56:27.160 --> 56:29.527
Eventually,

56:29.600 --> 56:31.887
your lungs collapse and you die.

56:31.960 --> 56:33.883
Before that happens,

56:33.960 --> 56:38.363
you're gonna get to watch me
slice you to little pieces.

57:20.680 --> 57:23.445
Good evening, sir, this is Kyle
with Guardalert Security.

57:23.520 --> 57:26.410
We have an indication there's an
alarm incident at your residence.

57:26.480 --> 57:29.609
I think you have the wrong number.
This is the Miller's residence.

57:29.720 --> 57:33.008
I need to speak to either Kyle,
Sarah or Avery Miller right away.

57:33.080 --> 57:35.162
Hang on a sec.

57:57.320 --> 57:58.560
Get up.

58:00.520 --> 58:01.851
Don't fuck with me.

58:01.920 --> 58:04.730
Drop the gun.

58:04.800 --> 58:07.167
How about you
drop the gun? Hm?

58:18.200 --> 58:20.362
You, too, sweetie.

58:20.440 --> 58:23.011
Except that's not even a nail
gun until it's turned on.

58:27.240 --> 58:30.210
Yeah, sorry about that.
Who did you say you were looking for?

58:30.280 --> 58:33.329
Sir, I've alerted
the local authorities.

58:33.400 --> 58:34.925
No, no, no.
Hang on. Hang on.

58:35.000 --> 58:36.764
Avery, can you talk to this woman?

58:36.840 --> 58:39.923
It's something about your alarm.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.321
Yeah, hi, this is Avery.

58:42.400 --> 58:45.085
Hi. You having a bit of
a party there tonight?

58:45.160 --> 58:48.243
Yeah, um, sorry.

58:48.320 --> 58:50.561
That was Brad and he's
emotionally retarded.

58:50.640 --> 58:52.768
How can I help you?

58:52.880 --> 58:55.201
Well, your alarm went off
so I need you to provide me

58:55.280 --> 58:58.090
with the password to this account.

58:58.160 --> 59:01.767
If for any reason you feel
like you can't speak...

59:01.840 --> 59:04.969
No, no, um, um, it's-it's "diamond."

59:07.720 --> 59:10.246
That's right, isn't it?

59:10.320 --> 59:13.403
Yes. Yes, it is.

59:19.560 --> 59:21.722
Patrol cars have been
dispatched to your location.

59:21.800 --> 59:24.087
The officers will need to verify...

59:24.160 --> 59:27.289
No. Please don't do that.
My parents have no idea I'm having this thing.

59:27.360 --> 59:30.045
If they find out, um, I'm dead.

59:30.120 --> 59:33.488
I mean, this is my first party here,

59:33.560 --> 59:37.406
and-and we're gonna clean
up and everything.

59:37.480 --> 59:40.484
And you have the password, okay?

59:47.880 --> 59:50.008
Okay?

59:50.080 --> 59:51.525
Okay? Please?

59:51.600 --> 59:54.126
Sure. Sure. Okay.

59:54.200 --> 59:57.841
I'll let it go this time, honey.

59:57.920 --> 59:59.684
Have a good time.

59:59.760 --> 01:00:00.841
Thank you.

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:08.602
You're a smart girl.
Okay.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.282
Let's start over.

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:25.284
Oh!

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:27.567
Oh, my God!

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:31.770
No! Stay there, dammit!
I'm fucking sick of you yelling all the time!

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:34.411
Shut up, Sarah!
Shut up!

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:37.609
It's your fucking fault!
I got it. I got it, bro. Okay?

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:39.523
Just trust me for a fucking moment.

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.602
Everyone just shut the fuck up!

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:45.480
And let me concentrate for a minute.

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.164
Avery, shut up.

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:50.244
We're just gonna sit for a minute.

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.361
You know what? When I was a little boy,

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.522
you know what my mom used to say to me?

01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:59.251
I'd get these headaches.
I'd be screaming and she would say,

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:02.449
"Elias, would you shut up?
You're taking all the air out of the room.

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:05.126
Air that other people could
be doing good things with."

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:07.089
I was never any good at anything.

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.049
I mean, I had a few jobs, you know,

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:10.804
nothing that stuck, though.

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:14.521
Avery, quiet, okay?
Daddy needs to concentrate.

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:22.567
There was one thing I was good at.
Selling dope, okay?

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:23.880
When I had the product,

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:26.486
everything worked.

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:29.803
I was so good at it, man, that they
decided they were gonna front me

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:33.123
$180,000 worth.

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:37.728
When they said that, I thought,
hey, this is too much, man.

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:41.646
I can't handle this.
But then I thought about it.

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:44.331
I figured, fuck it, man.

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:48.928
The world's been against
me my whole life.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.641
It's time I back myself and my girl.

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.121
Hey, buddy.

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.690
I want you to listen to me

01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:58.922
because I'm telling you a story.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.004
See? Somebody
jacked my shit.

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:04.082
$180,000 worth.

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.645
No, no, no.

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:10.326
No. No.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.926
Hundred an eighty.
That's a whole lot of money you owe.

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.850
Yeah. We're
getting it.

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:17.450
How?

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:21.206
Never mind how. Okay?
We're getting it.

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.851
He has a pretty face.

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:27.845
It would be a shame to
cut up a face like that.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:29.968
And there's some of us, you know,

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.247
we can't turn around and just say,

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:35.961
"Hey, man, I'm sorry. I'd love to pay
you back but I'm bankrupt, bro."

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:39.169
Which is why they sent
the big guy along.

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:42.084
Because I owe his boss a lot of money.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:44.367
So, guess who they're
gonna blame for that?

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:47.205
You know, it's really bad
mojo to cut the tax man.

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:49.681
So I'll tell you what, man.

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:51.808
Get me some cash.

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:55.123
And then we'll get this thing seen to.
All right?

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:05.521
I'm-I'm worth
more dead than alive.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:18.521
Baby, look.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:31.481
I guess I'm not the only one
you've been holding out on, huh?

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:34.450
You knew all along about my
baby brother and your wife.

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:52.927
Hey. No.
No, it's me, man.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.925
Well, he-he can't come
to the phone right now.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.890
I'm getting your goddamn
money, that's what I'm...

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:02.770
Yeah. Okay.

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.923
No, I'm sorry.
I'll-I'll be there.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.843
I'll be there.

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.924
Hey, man.

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:20.281
I'm sorry.

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.931
How's that leg doing?

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.923
I'm sorry about this.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.480
Looks like you had enough
problems before we came.

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:30.803
You know, you're not the
only one bleeding, man.

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:35.283
You could have saved us
all this fucking hassle.

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:37.169
No!

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.208
Stay away, you whore!

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:45.964
Back off.
Back off.

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:47.849
You're a coward.
You know that?

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:50.002
You're a fucking coward
and you are fucked up!

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:52.003
What the fuck did you expect?

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:55.527
Look. Look around you.
Could this be any more fucked up?

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.965
Oh, yeah.
It could be, man.

01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:58.844
Like if someone was here,

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:01.526
if someone was here for
something other than money.

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.967
What does that mean? Huh?
What does that mean?

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.530
You're not even supposed to be here...

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.011
No, you're not coming.

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.367
Why the hell I'm not?

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:12.046
You can go somewhere and get
yourself seen by a lot of people

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:13.770
and I'll call you afterwards.

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:16.491
How about I save you
the trouble of calling?

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.807
I'm here for the same
reasons and you know that.

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:20.689
You're not taking your medications.

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:22.524
What?

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:26.127
You're not taking your medications.

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:27.725
Medication.

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:30.406
That trick again?
Let me look at that.

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:31.686
Don't...

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:33.728
Mm.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:37.361
Man, you have an asshole of a doctor.

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:40.205
He prescribes
tic-tacs for psychosis.

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:53.006
Stay here.

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:13.003
Hey, it's a little late for
house calls, don't you think?

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:16.402
I apologize, Mr. Miller.
It's Officer Kelly, from Guardalert.

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:18.289
We had an alarm incident earlier.

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:20.124
Oh, yeah, yeah!
That was my daughter.

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.282
She had some people
over without asking us.

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:25.443
We worked it out.
She 's being punished.

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:27.488
Let me assure you.

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:30.086
Sorry, but the police
summons was canceled.

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:32.242
As a matter of Guardalert's protocol,

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:35.085
I just-I need a signature
from a family member.

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:40.691
How about we just all
get some sleep, huh?

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:42.762
I mean, thanks for stopping by.

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:44.444
I will have to notify the police.

01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:50.887
Give me a sec.

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:56.606
Kyle, I love you.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:59.251
I love you.

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:00.606
It doesn't matter.

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:03.889
You have to know, this is...

01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:05.928
It doesn't matter.

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:09.010
Believe me, please.

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:12.004
It matters to me.

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:19.244
Look, I'm sorry to trouble you.

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:21.448
I just need a signature
from a family member.

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:23.648
Yeah, it's no problem.

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:26.769
I'm just sorry you had to come all
the way out here for nothing.

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:29.923
Where do I sign?

01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:33.404
Fuck!

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:37.687
Are you fucking psycho?

01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:40.923
You fucking psycho!

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.163
Look at yourself. Huh?
Tell me who the psycho is.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:47.050
Me or the guy talking to a rent-a-cop
with blood all over your face?

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:49.327
Get the fuck outta here.

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:52.244
I knew this guy.
He took my shift tonight.

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:54.049
554 to dispatch.

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:56.851
1098 at the Miller
Residence. All clear.

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:08.531
Game over.

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:15.402
No, no, please, stop, stop.

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:18.649
I can get you your money. $200,000 cash.
Maybe more. Please. Please.

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:27.121
Baby, come on. We gotta go home.
Just do it. Come on.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.089
Don't you get it?
There is no home.

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:31.606
There's no money, There's no nothing.
End of the line.

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:34.286
Please! Please. This kid.
This kid, Jake. He has cash.

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:36.886
Stacks of it.
Stockpiled for the next 9/11.

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:38.246
She's messing with your head.

01:08:38.319 --> 01:08:39.890
No. He showed me.

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.367
I'm not lying.
Mom, I'm not lying.

01:08:46.439 --> 01:08:48.761
I-I can get you
bricks of cash.

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:50.841
Please. No alarms
and no security.

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:54.002
Where? Where?

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:58.768
Twenty minutes
from here. Please.

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:00.490
Twenty minutes.

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.562
Avery.

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:05.644
Listen, I know what I'm doing.
I know what I'm doing, okay?

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:08.200
Are you seriously buying this?

01:09:08.279 --> 01:09:10.567
No millions of dollars, no diamonds,

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:13.849
so we'll just have the
teenage girl go to the ATM.

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:15.724
What, you got a better idea?

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:18.201
You run. You don't
come back for us.

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:20.886
You hear me? Don't come back for us.

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:22.803
Avery! Avery!

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:24.006
Come!

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:27.091
Take her upstairs.

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:29.447
Avery, no.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.568
If you see people, if
you tell them anything,

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:36.529
I'm gonna kill your parents.

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:39.171
And I'm gonna do it as
punishment and then you'll know

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:42.288
it wasn't me that killed your parents.
It was you. Right?

01:09:42.359 --> 01:09:44.761
Now go Get changed.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:02.282
Honey. You rich people,
you don't smoke.

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:06.683
Sarah, you don't need to worry.

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:09.047
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.282
I will take care of you and Avery.

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:14.364
Okay? The way
he never did.

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:16.130
You know, you're right.

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:20.407
He 's right.

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:22.721
Come on, you don't really believe...

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:25.565
That you're a part of this?
That I'm a cuckold? What?

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:28.405
That your filthy lust
invited them in? What?

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:34.043
Jesus. He's insane.

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:51.169
Oh.

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:54.608
No, I'm-I'm sorry.
I-I couldn't help but overhear.

01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:56.603
Are you okay?

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:16.286
Excuse me.
What are you doing?

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.647
What are you doing?

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:24.044
You need to get your things.
You need to leave.

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:28.965
No.

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:30.963
No, I'm good.

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.963
I have the whole afternoon off.

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:39.722
You have to leave.

01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:41.325
You have to go.

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:42.885
Sarah. Sarah. Sarah!

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:44.849
Please! Please.
I asked you to leave.

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:46.206
I need you
to go. Please.

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:47.924
Really? Is that
what you want

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.889
or what you just you
think you should say?

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:51.883
What are you talking about?

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:53.564
This is good. Okay?

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.449
No, this is insane.
Please leave.

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:56.806
Be honest with yourself.

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.484
I am honest, I...

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:00.927
We could be so fucking good together.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.402
No. I'm gonna call your supervisor
if you don't get out right now.

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:06.608
I'm gonna call him and tell
him what you're doing.

01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:08.762
You don't need to.

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:11.207
Please. Come on.
You're scaring me.

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:12.805
I need you to leave.

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:14.723
Listen, you do not have to be unhappy.

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:17.246
I'm not unhappy, I...

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:21.325
I love my husband and I want
you to get out of my house.

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:22.680
Okay.

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:24.364
Get your stuff and leave.

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:25.771
I will go.

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.922
Oh, God, please don't touch me.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.446
You know I'm right.

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:40.128
Do you love her?

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:44.491
And she loves me.

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.767
Well, good.
Because that stuff

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:49.042
your brother was gonna
shoot her up with?

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:51.964
They use it for executions.
Did you know that?

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:55.886
Yeah. Yeah. That was the plan.
To execute her.

01:12:55.960 --> 01:13:00.124
So if you love her, take her,
find Avery and get out of here

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:01.770
before that jackass kills her!

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.810
Baby, you know you can do this, right?

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:15.483
I'm gonna take you to Mexico.

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:17.801
And we're, we're gonna get her...

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:20.724
We're gonna her out of foster
care, I'm gonna marry you,

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:22.564
and what are you gonna do?

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:24.244
You're gonna get clean, baby.

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:25.970
I'm gonna get clean.

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:33.925
But if it turns out that this party's
bullshit, what are you gonna do?

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:39.682
I'm gonna kill her.

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:45.601
I would never...

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:48.883
Never leave Avery, I know, which is why
you have to go with him now and get her.

01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:55.370
Sarah, come on.
Sarah. Sarah. Come on.

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:57.807
What are you waiting for? Go. Go.

01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:01.441
Come on. Sarah.
Come on.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.204
Go.

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:05.123
If you love me, you go.

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:07.248
Sarah!

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:27.971
So what's your little plan, princess?

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.050
This guy wants to have sex with me.

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:38.170
And he's gonna pay 100K just
for that little privilege?

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:41.244
You think you're worth that, huh?

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:43.846
Do you think you're worth
that much more than me?

01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:49.490
You know my plan, huh?
You wanna know my plan?

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:50.846
Stop it.
Stop it.

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:52.649
I'm gonna go in there

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:55.326
and I'm gonna blow
everybody's brains out.

01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:59.007
All your rich fuck friends.

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.731
Boom. Boom. Boom.

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:05.771
Off with their fucking heads.

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:09.441
Then I'm gonna take that cash
money and I'm gonna turn around

01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:11.602
and I'm gonna blow that smug

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:14.365
superior look off your fucking face.

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:16.647
You know what you are
gonna do about it?

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:20.486
You're gonna do shit!
Because you can't do shit, can you?

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:22.210
You can't do shit, can you?

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:37.811
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:40.281
Let's go.

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:41.566
Come on.

01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:54.890
Sarah!

01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:57.241
Sarah!

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:51.365
Ugh.

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:57.123
What the fuck did you do that for?

01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:59.771
You can't fucking hurt my brother.

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:02.286
Why are you protecting him, man?

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:07.810
He's the reason you're in this mess.
Think about it.

01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:09.644
What?

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:13.247
How did you think they
knew where you were going?

01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:16.881
Where you were taking the dope?

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:18.644
That's right.

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:20.563
He sold you out.

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:23.405
He 's fucking lying, okay?

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:26.643
So you'd have to come here

01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:31.886
to get his queen.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.764
That's bullshit. Okay?

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:35.330
It's bullshit!

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:38.449
How the fuck would you know?

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:40.045
Go. Go. Go.

01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:42.930
I was there.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.449
We got our dope back.
We owned your ass.

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:51.002
And your brother got ten grand.

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:52.411
No, man! No, no, no!

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:55.251
Shut up!

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.926
No, it's not true.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.368
Ain't family a bitch? Huh?

01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:13.921
He's lying.
He's fucking lying.

01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:17.931
He's fucking dead, man, that's what he is.
He's fucking dead.

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:23.849
Ugh.

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:34.846
Go. Get the police
and find Avery.

01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:37.651
No, I'm not
leaving you. What...

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:42.370
Hey, I got something for you, fucker!

01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:47.450
Ah!

01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:56.291
Leave her alone!
Leave her alone!

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.886
Ah, shit.

01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:08.883
I told you that there was cash!

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:10.849
You fucking people.

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:25.683
Man, you could have saved us
all a lot of aggravation.

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:29.207
You would have ki-ki-killed us sooner.

01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:31.886
Oh, well, you know, it
all ends up the same.

01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:33.883
Any last words?

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:39.366
Get out of our house.

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:43.047
Where's Petal?

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:45.043
Where is she? What did you do with her?

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:47.088
I'll kill you.

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:49.049
Not before I kill one of your parents.

01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:53.808
So which one 's it gonna be?
Huh ? Who?

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:56.724
I'll tell you what I'll
choose for ya. Mommy.

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:22.007
Oh, fuck.

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:24.890
You see, Sarah,

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:26.291
he didn't love you.

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:29.409
He knew you'd leave him for me.

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:32.927
Right? He saw divorce
and decided to cash out.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.809
Why, Kyle?

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:37.451
You were just gonna cry poor

01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:39.528
and screw your family in a settlement?

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:43.924
I was saving it for my family.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:49.643
Something the bank
c-couldn't take.

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:53.770
It's the money from the necklace.

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:58.846
I hid it to get us out of this.

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:01.002
Oh, well, thank you.

01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:03.003
Thank you, for all of it.

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:05.367
Sarah, do you wanna help
me with this cash?

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:06.930
Huh?

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:19.003
What? Kyle.

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:21.321
Run.

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:23.482
No. No. No!

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:24.846
Run.

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:27.685
Kyle. Kyle, no!
Kyle!

01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:29.125
We gotta go.

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:31.680
No! Kyle!

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:34.081
Sarah! Sarah!

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:36.043
Take Avery.

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:38.731
Kyle! Kyle!

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:40.564
Avery, I said run now!

01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:47.203
Sarah!

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:51.329
Run, Mom, please.

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:53.004
Avery.

01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:54.923
Come on.

01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:03.322
Leave

01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:04.526
my family

01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:07.489
alone.

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:11.761
Oh!

01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:19.731
No! No!

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:21.882
Get out of the way.

01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:24.531
You're gonna have to shoot me.

01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:27.524
I would-I would never hurt you.
I love you.

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:31.082
If you love me, give me the gun.

01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:38.203
Help me.

01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:41.045
Help me.
Help me.

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:45.041
Give me the gun! Please.

01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:47.361
Jonah.

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:50.051
I knew that you would
come back for me.

01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:51.610
Yeah.

01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:53.887
Yeah. That's right.

01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:57.567
I love you.
Come on.

01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:01.964
Give it to me.
It's fine. Yeah.

01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:03.684
I'll help you.

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:05.330
You're a liar!

01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:07.721
You're just trying to protect him!

01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:13.921
If I'm dying, you are coming with me.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.968
Okay? We
belong together.

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:30.763
Ah!

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:54.530
I'm sorry.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.331
Your necklace...

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:03.643
No, it doesn't
matter. Please.

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:07.122
I had insurance for when I'm gone.

01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:09.646
You're not going anywhere.

01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:11.722
We need you.

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:13.723
I need you.

01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:16.561
I need you.

01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:21.969
Mom! They're
coming. Dad!

01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:26.409
It's all right. Mom!
They're coming. They're coming.

01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:29.165
They're coming, Dad.
You're gonna be okay.

01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:33.522
They're here.
They're here.

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:35.489
You're gonna be okay, Dad.
