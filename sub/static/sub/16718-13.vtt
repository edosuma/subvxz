WEBVTT

00:17.480 --> 00:19.400
Are you really ready for it?

00:20.960 --> 00:25.520
I would go away
from here, but I can't.

00:27.360 --> 00:30.280
When I can't be an emergency
room doctor anymore

00:30.720 --> 00:32.520
is it okay to be a
chaplain in the hospital?

00:33.840 --> 00:35.520
I am happy about the chance.

00:38.480 --> 00:39.800
The new drugs are not working?

00:43.240 --> 00:44.840
Have you thought about
an operation again?

00:45.040 --> 00:48.600
The brain pacemaker?
Yes, I have thought carefully.

00:49.360 --> 00:50.600
Especially with
regard to the risks...

00:51.640 --> 00:53.880
I could lose my
memories and my life.

00:54.240 --> 00:56.000
Or it can change
your life, Rollie.

00:57.160 --> 00:58.960
Fields says you would
be a good candidate.

00:59.080 --> 01:00.240
But maybe not much longer.

01:00.360 --> 01:01.600
Yes I know that.

01:02.200 --> 01:05.680
I think you should change
your mind because...

01:07.480 --> 01:11.120
It looks like a disaster,
an apartment fire.

01:11.240 --> 01:13.400
Look, I understand what you
were saying, Dr.  Campbell.

01:13.560 --> 01:14.920
But I've made up my mind.

01:15.320 --> 01:18.920
Fine, but there are
rules for your new job.

01:19.560 --> 01:21.560
You can give advice and comfort

01:21.680 --> 01:22.840
to those who
wish, but you can...

01:23.080 --> 01:27.160
I am not allowed to
treat patients, understood.

01:34.480 --> 01:36.240
The first emergency vehicle will
be on the ramp in two minutes.

01:36.640 --> 01:38.400
Hey guys.  30 to 40
patients come straight away.

01:38.800 --> 01:41.000
So smoke inhalation,
burns and injuries.

01:41.120 --> 01:43.440
You in the second year, what
do you do first with burn victims?

01:43.720 --> 01:46.360
-Intubate early...
-... with burned airways.

01:46.480 --> 01:47.440
Expect fluid deficit.

01:47.560 --> 01:48.640
Rollie, good to see you.

01:48.760 --> 01:49.920
Likewise, Leanne.

01:50.280 --> 01:52.720
-Dr.  Guthrie...
-No, I'm just Rollie.

01:53.320 --> 01:54.520
You're still a doctor.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.840
This way I don't
confuse the patients.

01:56.960 --> 01:58.240
I am there to support you.

01:58.920 --> 01:59.880
That pleases me.

02:00.080 --> 02:02.000
Leighton, Pineda,
Savetti, take care!

02:02.560 --> 02:04.200
Disturbed families
are coming soon.

02:04.320 --> 02:05.360
Yes, I will be there.

02:08.880 --> 02:09.840
What's up?

02:09.960 --> 02:11.920
A 55-year-old, smoke inhalation
and shortness of breath.

02:12.040 --> 02:13.200
He complains of
severe chest pain.

02:13.440 --> 02:15.200
Lola?  Lola!

02:15.680 --> 02:16.680
-His daughter.
-Lola!

02:16.800 --> 02:18.800
She lost her balance as
she helped him up the ladder.

02:18.920 --> 02:19.880
She fell two floors.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.680
-Come with you?
-No, another car.

02:21.800 --> 02:22.760
What is going on here?

02:22.880 --> 02:25.280
A 28 year old.  2nd degree
burns to chest and neck.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.040
Diffuse wheezing
after smoke inhalation.

02:27.160 --> 02:28.720
Okay, why is it fixed?

02:29.040 --> 02:30.760
Acute restlessness.
Absolutely incoherent.

02:30.880 --> 02:33.480
She must be confused
about the lack of oxygen.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.480
My daughter.  She saved me.

02:37.600 --> 02:38.680
Let's take him to
the Center Stage.

02:42.200 --> 02:45.440
It's arabic.  She's talking
about a baby.  Is there a baby

02:45.560 --> 02:47.600
There may be a baby in
one of the cars.  Check it out!

02:47.720 --> 02:50.720
Eloise, ask at
headquarters for a baby

02:50.840 --> 02:53.320
- that came unaccompanied.
-Get a translator.

02:53.760 --> 02:54.760
Center Stage?

02:55.040 --> 02:56.360
Is busy.
It has to be in the side panel.

02:56.720 --> 02:58.040
Where is he?  Where is the child?

02:58.160 --> 03:00.240
Sir, lean back in.
You have to breathe.

03:00.360 --> 03:01.320
Child?  Her child?

03:01.440 --> 03:04.280
No!  The little bastard that
it was.  He started the fire!

03:04.400 --> 03:05.680
He burned down my building!

03:08.000 --> 03:10.640
Breathe with me.
Breathe... calmly...

03:11.240 --> 03:12.280
Your wheezing is getting worse.

03:12.800 --> 03:15.920
We need ventilation and 5
units of Haldoperidol per IV.

03:16.040 --> 03:17.000
Scissors.

03:17.320 --> 03:19.840
-What do you have here?
-A 26 year old, passed out,

03:20.280 --> 03:22.760
blunt injuries on the abdomen,
defensive tension and on both sides

03:22.880 --> 03:25.040
Injuries to the lower
limbs, pulse not felt.

03:25.160 --> 03:26.360
Okay, Doppler confirmation.

03:26.480 --> 03:27.440
That's okay.

03:27.560 --> 03:28.560
Hurry up.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.320
I need to know how
my daughter is doing.

03:31.440 --> 03:34.920
Where's Lola?  My chest hurts

03:35.040 --> 03:36.240
I will give you pain medication.

03:36.360 --> 03:38.400
He has to go to cardiology,
looks like a heart attack.

03:38.520 --> 03:41.600
That is not enough.  At 1 and
2, the ST extension depression,

03:41.720 --> 03:44.000
-and the increase under aVR?
- Infarct, left main artery.

03:44.120 --> 03:45.760
He'll need a bypass.

03:45.880 --> 03:47.440
Let the OP know.
Prepare everything.

03:47.560 --> 03:50.280
No blood flow in the foot, it
needs to be directed.  Dr.  Willis?

03:50.400 --> 03:51.360
I'm on my way.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.280
Thank you.  Ready?

03:54.720 --> 03:57.520
Do you have the foot?
One two Three.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.200
Dr.  Willis!
He's having a heart attack!

04:01.880 --> 04:03.800
Go on, check the
pulse and re-shine.

04:03.920 --> 04:04.880
I start the resuscitation.

04:10.880 --> 04:13.640
Daddy  Daddy!  I love you.

04:15.120 --> 04:16.560
We have to get him
out of here right now.

04:17.800 --> 04:18.760
Dad!

04:20.560 --> 04:21.839
Daddy i love you

04:22.640 --> 04:24.520
-Daddy.
-Keep still, okay?

04:24.640 --> 04:25.720
Your ankle is not stable.

04:25.840 --> 04:29.320
Your dad had a heart attack
and is going to be operated on.

04:29.600 --> 04:30.840
We take care of him.

04:30.960 --> 04:32.560
Good blood circulation in the foot.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.200
She needs an abdominal
CT after splinting.

04:35.320 --> 04:36.280
The drugs are there.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.400
OK.
Kerlix and silver sulfadiazine.

04:38.560 --> 04:39.560
Will be done.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.440
A boy of four months.

04:41.880 --> 04:44.520
Slight burns 1st and
2nd degree, good values.

04:44.640 --> 04:47.240
See, your baby was found.
He is safe.

04:50.880 --> 04:51.880
He has to go to the neonatal unit.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.040
Let her see him, please.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.680
She can't hold him
because of the burns.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.080
You're welcome.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.320
Here you go.  Fast.

04:57.480 --> 04:58.600
OK?  Chill out.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.480
There it is, see?

05:01.680 --> 05:03.800
He's okay  I have
to treat him now.

05:07.320 --> 05:08.280
He'll be over there.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.360
Chill out.

05:10.920 --> 05:12.760
Something is not right.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.000
-She said babies.
-What?

05:14.120 --> 05:16.240
Babies.  Not baby, babies.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.800
Moment.  There are two?

05:18.920 --> 05:19.880
Are there two babies?

05:23.040 --> 05:24.120
There are two.  They are twins.

05:32.480 --> 05:35.480
Tell the driver to
turn off the alarm.

05:36.080 --> 05:37.040
Okay good.

05:37.800 --> 05:40.680
I said they are twins.
They just brought us a baby.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.360
We made some
sacrifices at St. Joe's.

05:42.480 --> 05:43.680
I called St. Joe's.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.920
Well, I'll check.  Description?

05:46.440 --> 05:48.440
About six months, female...

05:48.680 --> 05:51.600
Do I really have to
describe a baby to you?

05:51.920 --> 05:55.240
You know what?  Just bring
all of the babies here, okay?

05:55.680 --> 05:58.600
I need to see my father, please.

06:01.040 --> 06:03.960
Can anyone hear me
Is there a doctor here?

06:04.200 --> 06:05.720
-Someone who...
-What's going on here?

06:05.840 --> 06:09.120
I want to see my father,
but nobody brings me to him.

06:09.240 --> 06:10.760
Because you have two broken legs

06:11.120 --> 06:13.240
and a liver injury.
You have nowhere to go

06:13.360 --> 06:14.480
He's also still in the operating room.

06:15.680 --> 06:17.560
Do you want to be fixed

06:17.760 --> 06:18.960
You don't understand.

06:19.160 --> 06:22.440
We argued and...
I said something.

06:23.280 --> 06:24.800
Fathers and daughters
are always fighting.

06:25.520 --> 06:28.480
What I said to him must
not have been the last.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.720
I have to tell him I'm sorry.

06:32.320 --> 06:34.480
When he's out of the operating
room, I'll try to take you there.

06:34.840 --> 06:35.880
When?

06:37.080 --> 06:39.640
Hey Risa.  How about Emanuel?

06:40.160 --> 06:43.000
No you have to do that.

06:43.520 --> 06:44.760
That can't wait.

06:45.560 --> 06:47.160
You have to tell him I'm sorry.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.040
You're welcome.

06:52.720 --> 06:55.280
That's crazy.
Rollie Guthrie has the jackpot.

06:55.400 --> 06:57.040
The operation cannot be
performed on everyone.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.960
Okay, sew the fabric
away from the blockage.

07:01.240 --> 07:03.320
Next to the left
coronary artery.  All right.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.120
You told him time
is running out, right?

07:05.240 --> 07:06.880
That he won't be a
candidate forever?

07:08.200 --> 07:09.200
He knows that.

07:09.480 --> 07:10.440
This is insane.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.000
- Did you ask him why?
-I beg your pardon?

07:12.280 --> 07:13.240
Of course not.

07:13.360 --> 07:15.040
Try to ask him why he
doesn't want the surgery.

07:15.240 --> 07:16.480
Maybe he has a good reason.

07:21.640 --> 07:24.560
She says the baby was in
the back room, it's called Adira.

07:24.680 --> 07:25.800
She speaks very quickly.

07:27.960 --> 07:30.120
I understand.

07:30.800 --> 07:34.640
Not your words, but what
you're going through, okay?

07:37.520 --> 07:38.600
Dr.  Rorish.

07:43.800 --> 07:46.160
We found the baby.
It'll come in a few minutes.

07:47.240 --> 07:48.280
How is the condition?

07:50.600 --> 07:52.960
It is alive, but it
shows no reaction.

07:55.160 --> 07:56.720
Should i tell her

08:01.160 --> 08:02.480
No not yet.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.200
Are you still in pain?
We can give you more.

08:14.240 --> 08:17.160
That's him!  That's him!
He burned my house down!

08:17.280 --> 08:18.640
Sir, you have to
stay in your bed, yes?

08:18.760 --> 08:22.480
Jared!  Thank god!
Can you hear me?  Jared?

08:22.600 --> 08:25.120
This is my son.  Is he alright?
Why is he not responding?

08:25.240 --> 08:27.680
He has 2nd degree burns
on his chest and stomach.

08:27.960 --> 08:29.920
See who finally shows up.

08:30.240 --> 08:31.480
What?  Larry!

08:31.640 --> 08:34.400
Twice a week I'll
turn off your fire alarm

08:34.520 --> 08:36.000
because your child
is burning their food.

08:36.120 --> 08:37.080
He likes to cook.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.080
He has to cook.
You are never there.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.679
I blame you!

08:40.799 --> 08:44.200
Your irresponsibility burned
the whole house down!

08:44.320 --> 08:46.080
It wasn't me, dad.  I swear.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.320
Just stay down.

08:47.440 --> 08:49.120
If my son says it
wasn't him, it wasn't him.

08:49.240 --> 08:50.320
Call the police!

08:50.440 --> 08:51.400
Leave him in peace!

08:51.520 --> 08:53.080
-It's just your...
-Don't touch me.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.000
That's enough!
I said that's enough!

08:55.120 --> 08:57.640
Come on, get her out.
Go back to your bed.

08:57.760 --> 09:00.640
You left him alone.
These people are dead.

09:01.160 --> 09:02.360
This is your fault, Devon!

09:05.240 --> 09:06.600
-Dr.  Rorish.
-Forgiveness.  What do we have here?

09:06.760 --> 09:09.320
A 30 year old with minor
injuries, severe bradycardia

09:09.440 --> 09:10.800
Hypotensive from
smoke inhalation.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.840
Center Stage is full,
take her to the side area.

09:13.360 --> 09:14.400
Your son, Jack.

09:17.520 --> 09:19.760
Hi Jack.  We'll take good
care of your mom, right?

09:20.200 --> 09:21.400
Eloise will take care of you.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.720
Ok go  She needs
high-flow oxygen.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.920
Ready?  One two Three.

09:37.880 --> 09:38.880
Check your pulse, Malaya.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.040
The pulse is down to around 20.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.440
Atropine doesn't work.
Should we give her dopamine?

09:45.040 --> 09:46.680
The fire department found
this next to her in her room.

09:48.560 --> 09:49.520
Atenolol.

09:49.640 --> 09:51.200
This is a beta blocker overdose.

09:51.360 --> 09:52.760
Dopamine doesn't work,
she needs glucagon.

09:52.880 --> 09:54.800
I'm losing her pulse,
starting resuscitation.

09:58.040 --> 09:59.920
Dr.  Willis, did you
want to see me?

10:00.560 --> 10:02.280
I want to know how
Emanuel Johnson is doing.

10:02.440 --> 10:04.440
Still unconscious,
but stable.  How so?

10:04.560 --> 10:05.960
I have a message
from his daughter.

10:06.080 --> 10:07.240
When he wakes up,
will you page me?

10:08.640 --> 10:10.120
Dr.  Willis, it's about Lola.

10:11.280 --> 10:12.240
What happened?

10:12.360 --> 10:14.680
She wanted to see her dad, and
her blood pressure plummeted.

10:14.800 --> 10:15.920
We have a baby here.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.120
Is this the other twin?

10:19.440 --> 10:21.160
The paramedics just found them.
No burns.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.560
She was stuck in a
room full of smoke.

10:23.760 --> 10:26.080
The pulse is slow at
160, capillarization time.

10:26.240 --> 10:27.600
Dr.  Dixon, what do you see?

10:28.320 --> 10:31.360
Retinal hemorrhage.
And cherry skin.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.000
This is CO poisoning.

10:37.120 --> 10:38.760
-Mommy?
-Sorry, he ran away.

10:38.880 --> 10:39.840
Get him out now!

10:41.840 --> 10:42.840
The glucagon is there.

10:42.960 --> 10:43.920
It has to work.

10:50.360 --> 10:51.960
Looks like she tore
open the liver wound.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.200
We have to stop the bleeding.

10:53.400 --> 10:54.520
Your stomach is full of blood.

10:54.960 --> 10:56.160
Center Stage, go.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.640
Put them in a
hyperbaric chamber.

10:58.760 --> 10:59.880
It needs hyperbaric
oxygen to replace

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
the carbon monoxide
in hemoglobin.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.480
-I'm going to get a senior doctor.
-No.

11:04.040 --> 11:05.480
Nobody is here except you.

11:05.680 --> 11:06.680
What?

11:06.800 --> 11:08.600
Four emergency vans
come up the ramp.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.160
-Rollie, go with me.
-I am not allowed to treat.

11:11.280 --> 11:12.920
You are in front of the chamber.
No time to discuss.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.040
She has to get in there immediately.

11:14.160 --> 11:15.480
-Come on!
-Let's go.

11:21.520 --> 11:25.800
Jesse, good.  Give
me two units, far up.

11:26.920 --> 11:27.880
All right.

11:28.680 --> 11:30.080
Systolic blood
pressure is at 64.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.360
Appears posterior, presumably
the inferior vena cava.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.320
Let's try a Pringle maneuver.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.280
That gives us time
until the operation.

11:39.200 --> 11:40.400
The bleeding subsides.

11:40.560 --> 11:41.600
The blood pressure rises.

11:41.720 --> 11:44.080
It's not over the mountain.
Let's take her to the operating room.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.360
Your oxygen levels drop rapidly.

11:46.480 --> 11:47.560
You have to intubate.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.320
Never have I ever
intubated a baby.

11:49.440 --> 11:50.640
Dr.  Dixon, listen to me.

11:51.600 --> 11:54.040
You are your only chance.
Do you understand?

11:56.200 --> 11:57.200
You can do it.

11:59.440 --> 12:02.160
The baby's relatively large
head causes the neck to flex.

12:02.280 --> 12:04.800
Put a towel under your
shoulder for a better view.

12:06.760 --> 12:07.800
Good Good.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.360
Very gently.

12:11.960 --> 12:13.120
Tell me what you see

12:16.000 --> 12:18.840
Nothing.  The vocal
cords are too far forward.

12:18.960 --> 12:22.280
Use a Miller laryngoscope
to elevate the epiglottis.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.400
Concentration, Dr.  Dixon.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.040
There is only you
and your patient.

12:33.160 --> 12:34.120
I see nothing.

12:34.520 --> 12:35.480
Fine

12:35.600 --> 12:38.200
Then lift it up and
slide the tube in.

12:41.920 --> 12:43.880
Your heart stopped!
I need help!

12:44.160 --> 12:46.480
-I can't open the door.
-The room is under pressure.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.040
Elliot, start the resuscitation.

13:05.360 --> 13:06.320
Check the pulse.

13:16.360 --> 13:17.320
Damn it.

13:18.520 --> 13:19.880
How long has she been asystolic?

13:21.320 --> 13:22.360
For 32 minutes.

13:30.920 --> 13:31.880
Explain death.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.040
No.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.320
No, I can go on.

13:37.440 --> 13:40.360
Dr.  Dixon, you
did what you could.

13:41.160 --> 13:44.360
You have to
explain death, I can't.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.400
Time of death, 11:01 p.m.

14:14.440 --> 14:15.560
Please get me out of here.

14:18.560 --> 14:19.720
That will not do.

14:22.880 --> 14:25.160
We have to decompress
the chamber first.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.120
How long?

14:30.200 --> 14:31.360
About an hour.

14:33.640 --> 14:34.880
I'm sorry son

14:37.000 --> 14:38.440
I wish I could have helped.

14:50.440 --> 14:51.560
Is that the pastor's daughter?

14:51.960 --> 14:52.920
Lola.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.120
Dr.  Pinkney and I stopped
the bleeding, but the

14:55.240 --> 14:59.240
liver is injured, and possibly
the vena cava as well.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.600
As long as the
vessels are supplied,

15:01.720 --> 15:03.040
we can save most of their liver.

15:03.160 --> 15:04.120
Yes...

15:04.240 --> 15:06.600
She wanted me to tell her
father something important.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.200
He's not awake.

15:08.320 --> 15:09.280
She's bleeding again.

15:09.680 --> 15:10.760
I'm coming.

15:11.720 --> 15:14.040
We didn't save
Emanuel to let her die.

15:14.680 --> 15:15.880
Can I please assist?

15:17.560 --> 15:18.520
See you in there.

15:25.640 --> 15:27.200
Rima, I'm so sorry.

15:28.880 --> 15:30.600
The doctors did
everything they could...

15:32.120 --> 15:33.800
... they couldn't
save your baby.

15:50.600 --> 15:51.680
I'm so sorry.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.400
How many died in the fire?

16:06.680 --> 16:07.800
You know Jared...

16:11.120 --> 16:14.000
We see really bad
things here every day.

16:14.400 --> 16:15.640
Terrible accidents.

16:16.400 --> 16:20.960
But they are accidents.

16:25.760 --> 16:27.960
I was playing with
fireworks on the roof.

16:29.360 --> 16:31.840
Just a few firecrackers.

16:32.440 --> 16:33.600
I was just playing around.

16:34.880 --> 16:39.120
One of them caught fire
and fell down a drainpipe.

16:40.840 --> 16:43.480
I was scared of what to say.
I shouldn't be up there.

16:44.280 --> 16:46.640
I didn't know anything
was happening.

16:50.920 --> 16:54.240
All of these people
are hurt because of me.

16:59.280 --> 17:00.720
You are dead because of me.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.119
How long is he in there?

17:22.319 --> 17:23.480
Thirty-seven minutes.

17:25.880 --> 17:28.079
Dr.  Guthrie, the pastor who was

17:28.200 --> 17:29.680
admitted, asks
about the chaplain.

17:30.880 --> 17:34.480
Are you going.
I'm staying here with Elliot.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.120
OK.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.080
Hey, Tracy.  How do you feel?

18:02.960 --> 18:06.720
I sent Jack to the
cafeteria with a sister

18:07.640 --> 18:09.080
but he wasn't very hungry.

18:11.920 --> 18:14.320
Don't worry, I'll make
sure he eats something.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.160
He's better off without me.

18:17.280 --> 18:18.240
That's not true.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.240
You do not know me.

18:21.880 --> 18:23.080
That's true.

18:23.680 --> 18:24.920
I saw your scars on your wrists.

18:25.960 --> 18:27.440
You've already
been through this.

18:29.240 --> 18:30.360
A few times.

18:33.240 --> 18:34.240
You have a son.

18:34.480 --> 18:35.760
Do you think I don't know?

18:36.040 --> 18:37.840
We could get you some help.

18:38.480 --> 18:41.200
I just need someone
to take this boy.

18:47.400 --> 18:48.760
He needs a good home.

18:48.880 --> 18:50.400
But you're his mother.

18:50.640 --> 18:53.160
Don't talk like you know me.

18:53.280 --> 18:55.680
You don't do that.  You don't even
know what I was going through.

18:58.640 --> 18:59.720
Where is his father

19:02.000 --> 19:03.160
He left us.

19:05.680 --> 19:07.200
One day he just ran away.

19:08.560 --> 19:09.680
I am so sorry.

19:10.920 --> 19:12.200
He left me all alone.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.160
When I needed him most.

19:17.080 --> 19:18.360
Tracy, listen up.

19:20.520 --> 19:22.640
Your tablets have
slowed your breathing

19:23.160 --> 19:24.760
so that you inhaled less smoke.

19:26.600 --> 19:27.560
As strange as that
is, you wanted to

19:27.680 --> 19:30.880
kill yourself and
that saved your life.

19:32.840 --> 19:35.560
This is a second chance
as it is in the book.

19:42.320 --> 19:44.560
Hey  You can't move like that.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.120
We just operated
on your injured liver.

19:46.880 --> 19:48.240
Did you deliver the
message to my dad?

19:48.800 --> 19:50.720
Not yet.  He's still
passed out from surgery.

19:50.840 --> 19:53.560
He is recovering.  It looks
good, he should be awake soon.

19:53.800 --> 19:55.600
But I'm worried
about you right now.

19:56.400 --> 19:58.000
You have to heal yourself too.

19:58.400 --> 19:59.520
Heal yourself.

20:00.920 --> 20:02.160
That's what my father said.

20:02.920 --> 20:04.640
He always brings it to
his Sunday sermons.

20:06.920 --> 20:09.360
There is only a fine line
between medicine and faith.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.680
Are you a believer, Dr.  Willis?

20:15.200 --> 20:16.480
I believe in medicine.

20:18.160 --> 20:19.840
My dad would have
something to say about that.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.400
As with everything.

20:22.440 --> 20:23.400
Are you close

20:24.120 --> 20:25.760
When it's not on my neck.

20:27.040 --> 20:28.600
He doesn't accept that I am an

20:28.720 --> 20:30.400
adult and can make
my own decisions.

20:31.880 --> 20:33.680
It's hard to let go
of those we love.

20:34.760 --> 20:38.320
He shouldn't let go of me,
just let me go to New York.

20:39.360 --> 20:40.440
What's in New York?

20:41.720 --> 20:42.680
Broadway.

20:44.040 --> 20:45.120
Are you a dancer

20:45.920 --> 20:46.920
A female singer.

20:48.360 --> 20:51.240
I've always been in the
church choir, but when I was 12

20:52.520 --> 20:53.480
I saw Les Misérables.

20:54.400 --> 20:56.240
He always said, "If you want
to find God, go to church."

20:56.360 --> 20:59.440
And if you want to sing,
you go to New York.

21:00.520 --> 21:01.560
Did you fight about it?

21:03.200 --> 21:06.080
He said I am turning away
from him, the church and God.

21:07.160 --> 21:09.400
I said I don't care.
It was a bad argument.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.040
I yelled at him:
"To hell with God!"

21:11.160 --> 21:13.480
His expression.  I could
have spit on him as well.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.480
He must know that I
didn't mean any of that.

21:18.840 --> 21:21.560
He needs to know that I
love him and that I am sorry.

21:23.440 --> 21:25.400
Do you want me to take you
upstairs and tell him yourself?

21:26.240 --> 21:27.280
I need to see a patient.

21:28.040 --> 21:29.120
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

21:38.720 --> 21:39.760
Rima.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.640
I know how difficult
this is for you.

21:45.840 --> 21:49.120
And believe me, there are
no words of comfort for that.

21:53.720 --> 21:56.240
But Sami is still alive.

22:03.560 --> 22:04.680
He will make it.

22:09.720 --> 22:10.720
They have each other.

22:24.800 --> 22:27.000
No, I don't want to see him.

22:27.120 --> 22:29.120
Rima, but he's your son.

22:31.400 --> 22:32.840
No, I don't want to see him.

22:35.360 --> 22:36.440
I don't want to see him.

22:39.320 --> 22:41.160
I don't want to see him.
My daughter is dead

22:41.280 --> 22:42.240
My daughter is dead

22:43.960 --> 22:45.520
Okay okay

22:57.680 --> 23:01.160
I'm Rollie Guthrie,
I'm the chaplain here.

23:01.720 --> 23:03.120
You wanted someone
to pray together?

23:03.440 --> 23:05.160
I prayed for my daughter.

23:05.520 --> 23:06.560
Yes of course.

23:11.480 --> 23:14.800
I have to admit, this is
my first day as a pastor.

23:15.400 --> 23:18.680
I am not exactly qualified
in the traditional sense.

23:18.840 --> 23:20.360
I am actually a doctor.

23:20.480 --> 23:21.600
Do you know the bible?

23:22.080 --> 23:23.040
For sure.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.320
This is a good start.

23:28.600 --> 23:29.720
What is bothering you?

23:29.840 --> 23:31.520
No, I'm here
because of you, father.

23:32.960 --> 23:35.280
It helps me that I can help you.

23:39.080 --> 23:40.960
I saw a child die today.

23:42.800 --> 23:44.400
And now you doubt God.

23:45.400 --> 23:46.360
No.

23:46.600 --> 23:50.440
You are human.
And people want answers.

23:51.680 --> 23:56.320
These answers don't come in
the form of any visible evidence.

23:58.120 --> 24:00.960
They require you to believe
in something you can't see.

24:03.040 --> 24:06.080
After all, that's what
we call "belief", isn't it?

24:08.160 --> 24:09.800
Otherwise we
would call it "proof".

24:11.800 --> 24:15.160
My daughter and
I recently had an

24:15.280 --> 24:18.240
argument and I
asked God for help.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.120
And did you get an answer?

24:22.600 --> 24:27.200
He would have more children
if raising them was easy.

24:29.320 --> 24:30.720
Do you have children, Rollie?

24:30.880 --> 24:32.160
Yes a son.

24:33.520 --> 24:35.120
Unfortunately, we are not close.

24:36.080 --> 24:37.560
I try to reach him.

24:39.280 --> 24:43.520
I have to make a decision
and talk to him first.

24:45.080 --> 24:46.320
I'm so sorry.

24:50.600 --> 24:51.800
I am scared, father.

24:52.920 --> 24:54.360
Do you believe in god my son

24:54.720 --> 24:55.720
Yes.

24:56.360 --> 24:57.640
Then you don't
need to be afraid.

25:03.600 --> 25:05.520
Emanuel?  Emanuel!

25:09.000 --> 25:10.040
Emanuel.

25:16.040 --> 25:17.200
His lungs are full of fluids.

25:17.440 --> 25:20.000
Loud diastolic.
The aortic valve is torn.

25:20.120 --> 25:21.080
The pulse is weak.

25:21.240 --> 25:22.640
We have to get him back to
the operating room immediately!

25:33.800 --> 25:35.280
I'll take Lola up to her father.

25:36.320 --> 25:37.280
Haven't you heard?

25:38.360 --> 25:39.320
What?

25:42.720 --> 25:44.520
He had an extremely
bad aortic valve rupture.

25:44.640 --> 25:46.560
We tried emergency intervention

25:48.080 --> 25:49.840
but the cardiogenic
shock was too advanced.

25:50.240 --> 25:51.560
-He died.
-Yes.

25:54.960 --> 25:56.800
I told her I'll get her
up in 10 minutes.

25:57.800 --> 25:58.760
Before an hour.

26:04.400 --> 26:05.720
She doesn't want to see the baby.

26:07.320 --> 26:09.080
Grief is not logical.

26:10.840 --> 26:11.800
No, that is right.

26:13.360 --> 26:15.280
We're lucky we were
able to save one.

26:15.560 --> 26:16.560
I know.

26:17.720 --> 26:20.040
But she is overwhelmed
with grief over the other baby.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.720
The little boy needs her now.

26:23.480 --> 26:24.640
And she needs him.

26:32.760 --> 26:34.360
I want to see him.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.120
Did you tell him I was sorry?

26:37.240 --> 26:39.280
I tried, when I came
he was sleeping.

26:40.240 --> 26:41.400
OK?  I tried.

26:42.720 --> 26:44.840
Then you should
have looked again.

26:47.960 --> 26:49.080
You promised.

26:49.680 --> 26:51.240
You said you'd tell him.

26:51.840 --> 26:53.800
Then you said
you'd take me to him.

26:54.040 --> 26:55.080
And you were too busy.

26:55.520 --> 26:56.640
Now he's dead.

26:57.280 --> 26:59.240
You said you
would be right back.

27:01.520 --> 27:04.240
Now my father will never
know how much I loved him.

27:04.360 --> 27:05.680
That's not correct.

27:05.920 --> 27:06.920
You don't know.

27:07.440 --> 27:08.440
You don't know anything.

27:11.640 --> 27:14.120
-Lola...
-Please go.

27:33.360 --> 27:34.480
I feel very sorry for him.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.120
His mother wanted
to kill herself.

27:37.120 --> 27:38.440
I don't know what to tell him.

27:39.720 --> 27:41.440
Dr.  Pineda believe me

27:41.640 --> 27:44.400
You can't say anything that
will make it better for him.

27:46.480 --> 27:48.200
We reached his
father in New York.

27:48.520 --> 27:50.960
He's flying here, but he'll
be on the road for a while.

27:53.440 --> 27:54.560
Maybe you could talk to him?

27:55.120 --> 27:56.520
No, I can not do that.

27:57.360 --> 27:58.320
Why not?

27:59.600 --> 28:00.720
Because I can not.

28:10.040 --> 28:11.040
Jared?

28:13.000 --> 28:14.760
Dr.  Savetti said you
wanna tell me something.

28:15.760 --> 28:17.480
It's okay.
You are doing the right thing.

28:18.720 --> 28:20.440
I was too scared to
tell you beforehand.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.360
What to say?

28:25.280 --> 28:26.640
That it was me

28:28.160 --> 28:29.440
I set the house on fire.

28:30.880 --> 28:31.840
What?

28:31.960 --> 28:33.800
I was stupid.  I played
around with fireworks...

28:33.920 --> 28:34.880
Fireworks?  Inside?

28:35.000 --> 28:35.960
I was on the roof.

28:36.080 --> 28:37.760
I don't care where it was!

28:39.040 --> 28:40.080
What's wrong with you

28:40.200 --> 28:41.160
Sometimes very slowly.

28:41.280 --> 28:42.520
-People died.
-I am sorry.

28:42.640 --> 28:43.600
You are sorry

28:46.600 --> 28:47.800
I need a lawyer

28:48.680 --> 28:49.640
No you do not need to.

28:50.360 --> 28:51.400
It wasn't him.

28:53.320 --> 28:54.280
Tell him.

28:54.640 --> 28:56.040
The fire started in the basement.

28:56.600 --> 28:57.600
What?

28:58.240 --> 28:59.600
It was due to a
defective power line.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.520
It was my fault.  Not yours.

29:09.760 --> 29:14.120
Forgive me for what
i said  I was wrong.

29:16.680 --> 29:17.840
OK.

29:34.080 --> 29:35.440
LOS ANGELES FIRE DEPARTMENT

29:36.000 --> 29:37.360
He's still very upset.

29:39.280 --> 29:40.480
Let me talk to him.

29:54.320 --> 29:57.280
I lay awake at night, afraid of

29:57.400 --> 30:00.680
the feeling of losing a patient.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.160
But I never thought
that I would...

30:05.280 --> 30:06.640
I know.

30:07.480 --> 30:11.520
Losing a child, especially a

30:11.640 --> 30:13.160
baby, is the hardest
part of the job.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.680
Then I don't want him anymore.

30:18.800 --> 30:19.920
I stop.

30:21.600 --> 30:22.680
What?

30:23.920 --> 30:25.600
I'm sorry.  I can not do this.

30:27.440 --> 30:28.480
Elliot, listen to me.

30:29.880 --> 30:31.760
Do you know why you
are good at the job?

30:32.960 --> 30:34.600
Because these are
not your patients.

30:35.880 --> 30:36.920
They are they.

30:38.280 --> 30:39.520
Do you know what I mean by that?

30:41.240 --> 30:45.720
Almost everyone has compassion.

30:46.840 --> 30:48.120
But empathy

30:48.840 --> 30:52.280
the gift of feeling
what other people feel

30:53.400 --> 30:54.800
you have that in you.

30:55.800 --> 30:57.160
Don't go away.

30:58.840 --> 31:01.320
Because this is not
your job, my son.

31:02.440 --> 31:03.480
This is your destiny.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.360
When you stop

31:07.920 --> 31:09.880
you will regret it for
the rest of your life.

31:10.960 --> 31:12.760
Believe me, my son.
I know that.

31:17.720 --> 31:19.680
Now keep your head up, Dr.  Dixon.

31:24.880 --> 31:25.840
Yes.

31:26.880 --> 31:28.000
Alleluia.

31:32.400 --> 31:33.640
Okay, Tracy.  It looks like...

31:35.080 --> 31:36.960
No no!  Dr.  Rorish!

31:37.920 --> 31:38.960
Dr.  Rorish!

31:41.320 --> 31:42.280
Oh my God!

31:43.040 --> 31:44.400
Let's get her to the
Center Stage, please.

31:45.880 --> 31:46.880
What's happening?

31:47.720 --> 31:48.720
Out of the way!

31:52.360 --> 31:53.600
Watch out!
Get out of the way guys!

31:54.880 --> 31:55.880
Watch out.

31:56.640 --> 31:59.640
I need sutures, a 4-0 and gauze.

32:00.840 --> 32:01.920
Spread out, spread out.

32:02.360 --> 32:03.440
How much blood did she lose?

32:03.560 --> 32:05.400
-At least three liters.
-I put a ZVK.

32:05.520 --> 32:06.920
First the airways.  Intubate.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.240
There's too much blood here.
I can't get to the artery.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.320
-What do we have here?
- Slashed wrists.

32:12.560 --> 32:13.520
Great loss of blood.

32:13.640 --> 32:14.960
Probably still
swelling after the fire.

32:15.080 --> 32:16.040
Put the fiber optics in.

32:16.160 --> 32:18.200
We have to stop this bleeding.

32:19.120 --> 32:21.400
Dr.  Guthrie, I need your help.

32:22.120 --> 32:23.360
Come here, Rollie.  Come on.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.680
I am not allowed to
cross the orange line.

32:25.800 --> 32:27.240
Rollie!  Open your eyes!

32:27.400 --> 32:28.840
What?  What do you mean by that?

32:28.960 --> 32:30.720
Rollie!  Open your eyes.

32:30.840 --> 32:32.000
Rollie!  Open your eyes.
Come on.

32:32.120 --> 32:33.200
Open your eyes.

32:33.320 --> 32:35.640
Open your eyes.

32:36.400 --> 32:38.440
Come back to consciousness.  Good.

32:39.360 --> 32:41.280
Go on, yes.  Open your eyes.

32:47.280 --> 32:48.400
Rollie, you're in the operating room.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.800
You are a little disoriented
from the anesthesia.

32:53.760 --> 32:55.680
I'm not ready for surgery yet.

32:56.360 --> 32:57.520
It sounded different a week ago.

32:58.040 --> 33:00.040
We've been here for four
hours and it's going great.

33:01.120 --> 33:03.120
Rollie, let's move on
to the questions now.

33:04.120 --> 33:05.160
Which questions?

33:05.280 --> 33:07.960
We asked you to answer
personal questions,

33:08.400 --> 33:11.000
so I know that I
won't break anything.

33:13.600 --> 33:14.720
I love this song.

33:15.400 --> 33:16.880
-Go to the next question.
-OK.

33:20.640 --> 33:22.440
Rollie, what university
did you go to?

33:25.000 --> 33:26.040
NYU.

33:26.160 --> 33:27.200
Very good.

33:28.560 --> 33:29.600
OK.

33:30.640 --> 33:32.200
Where did you do
your specialist training?

33:35.000 --> 33:36.080
Angels.

33:36.880 --> 33:38.160
How many kids do you have

33:40.160 --> 33:41.160
I have a son.

33:43.200 --> 33:44.280
Cole.

33:48.200 --> 33:49.240
Rollie...

33:52.000 --> 33:53.320
What was your father's name

33:54.920 --> 33:56.280
People want answers.

33:56.600 --> 34:00.760
These answers don't come in
the form of any visible evidence.

34:01.640 --> 34:05.200
You have to believe in
something that you cannot see.

34:05.600 --> 34:06.600
Emanuel.

34:08.159 --> 34:09.320
He was a pastor.

34:09.480 --> 34:12.280
We need nitroglycerin
by IV. 0.05 milligrams.

34:15.880 --> 34:17.239
That's why we call it "belief".

34:18.280 --> 34:20.960
Otherwise we
would call it "proof".

34:22.760 --> 34:23.760
What do you think rollie

34:24.080 --> 34:25.159
I am sure.

34:25.360 --> 34:27.960
You sure?  Not more?

34:28.159 --> 34:29.320
I am scared, father.

34:29.760 --> 34:31.199
Do you believe in god my son

34:31.320 --> 34:32.280
Yes.

34:32.400 --> 34:33.679
Then you don't have to be afraid.

34:35.199 --> 34:36.199
Emanuel?

34:37.000 --> 34:38.199
Daddy

34:46.920 --> 34:48.960
Now keep your head up, Dr.  Dixon.

34:49.080 --> 34:50.600
Why do you call me that?

34:50.719 --> 34:52.400
My name is Rollie...
Rollie Guthrie.

35:06.360 --> 35:08.040
Tears stream

35:09.160 --> 35:11.600
Down your face

35:12.160 --> 35:17.480
When you lose something
that you can't replace

35:19.560 --> 35:21.240
Tears stream

35:22.200 --> 35:24.960
She said babies.
Not baby, babies.

35:25.080 --> 35:26.160
There are two.  They are twins.

35:26.640 --> 35:27.840
This is CO poisoning.

35:29.680 --> 35:31.680
We're lucky we were
able to save one.

35:32.880 --> 35:34.960
But the death of the other
baby consumes them completely.

35:35.520 --> 35:38.560
He let me down when
I needed him most.

35:38.680 --> 35:39.920
You should talk to him.

35:40.080 --> 35:41.480
- I can not.
- Why not?

35:41.680 --> 35:44.040
Because I'm on the plane.
I was not here.

35:44.400 --> 35:46.520
You left him alone
and now there are dead.

35:46.880 --> 35:48.120
It's on you, Rollie.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.240
No.

35:58.840 --> 35:59.840
Tears stream

36:00.000 --> 36:01.360
Tears stream

36:01.480 --> 36:02.640
Down your face

36:02.760 --> 36:04.080
Down your face

36:04.600 --> 36:09.880
When you lose something
that you can't replace

36:12.040 --> 36:13.000
Tears stream

36:13.120 --> 36:14.440
Tears stream

36:14.600 --> 36:16.840
Down your face

36:25.160 --> 36:30.920
The lights will lead you home

36:31.760 --> 36:37.400
And inflame your bones

36:38.120 --> 36:43.480
And I'll try to heal you

36:52.000 --> 36:53.040
Welcome back.

36:53.480 --> 36:55.960
Rollie, you did a great job.

36:59.840 --> 37:01.040
None of this was real?

37:05.040 --> 37:06.000
I am not the pastor?

37:06.120 --> 37:08.760
Pastor?  We don't have that.

37:09.880 --> 37:12.720
You are a doctor, Rollie.
You always will be.

37:15.800 --> 37:16.920
Dr.  Guthrie?

37:17.160 --> 37:18.160
Why are you crying

37:18.480 --> 37:21.040
Why is Cole not there?

37:23.120 --> 37:25.560
Dad, dad.  I'm right here.

37:31.240 --> 37:32.280
Cole.

37:32.400 --> 37:33.840
I came last night remember

37:35.480 --> 37:37.320
There is something
I have to tell you son.

37:37.600 --> 37:38.800
Come on guys.

37:39.640 --> 37:41.120
Take a rest, dad.
We have a lot of time.

37:41.240 --> 37:43.760
No, I have to tell you now.

37:49.720 --> 37:51.360
There is something
you don't know

37:54.040 --> 37:55.400
You had a twin, Cole.

37:56.200 --> 37:58.360
A sister.  Her name was Lola.

37:59.400 --> 38:00.960
Okay dad.
For now, calm down...

38:01.240 --> 38:02.640
No, just listen.

38:03.600 --> 38:04.760
I have to tell you

38:06.440 --> 38:08.840
She died when you
were only a year old.

38:09.080 --> 38:10.240
We never told you.

38:10.880 --> 38:12.920
It was a terrible tragedy, Cole.

38:15.120 --> 38:17.760
I got out of the hospital late

38:18.440 --> 38:20.560
and looked after you two.

38:22.320 --> 38:24.000
But neither of you was breathing.

38:25.680 --> 38:27.920
It was a carbon monoxide leak.

38:28.240 --> 38:29.280
Dad, this is not the time...

38:29.400 --> 38:30.760
But.  Listen to me.

38:32.720 --> 38:34.640
I got you both and
your mother out.

38:34.840 --> 38:36.640
I ventilated you first.

38:38.240 --> 38:39.520
And you finally woke up

38:40.840 --> 38:44.000
but when I reached for Lola...

38:46.800 --> 38:48.400
She was freezing then.

38:49.880 --> 38:52.960
Cole, I wanted to save
her, I really wanted to

38:53.400 --> 38:54.680
but it was too late.

38:54.840 --> 38:56.880
No, Cole, listen to me.

38:57.520 --> 39:00.680
Your mother loved you,
my son.  She loved you

39:01.800 --> 39:05.200
But she couldn't take
the loss of your sister.

39:06.040 --> 39:07.040
You...

39:10.880 --> 39:13.840
No no.

39:14.960 --> 39:16.680
No, that wasn't the whole truth.

39:17.560 --> 39:19.760
We were lucky.
We were able to save one.

39:21.840 --> 39:24.080
I was overwhelmed by
the grief for the other child.

39:25.160 --> 39:26.680
It was me, Cole.

39:29.560 --> 39:32.360
I couldn't cope with the loss.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.760
Your mother was
doing badly, I knew that

39:38.040 --> 39:39.400
but I couldn't help her.

39:42.720 --> 39:44.840
Because I didn't know
how to help myself.

39:47.520 --> 39:51.040
I am so sorry my son.
I am so sorry.

39:51.160 --> 39:53.800
I love you more
than anything, but...

39:54.960 --> 39:56.280
...I have disappointed you.

39:56.880 --> 39:58.080
I have disappointed you.

39:58.200 --> 40:00.760
No, you didn't let me down, dad.

40:01.880 --> 40:02.920
You didn't let me down.

40:06.360 --> 40:07.440
It's OK.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.120
I love you too.

40:14.200 --> 40:15.600
And I am here now.

40:17.560 --> 40:18.720
I love you my son

40:18.840 --> 40:19.840
I love you too.
