You and them boys didn't get no spray
in that field.

03:48.784 --> 03:52.580
- They'll get to it first thing in the morning.
- They better.

03:52.788 --> 03:55.791
Fella said, "Why you beating
on the back of that truck?"

03:56.000 --> 04:03.174
He says, "I got a two-ton truck and four
tons of canaries. I gotta keep half flyin'."

04:04.800 --> 04:07.219
How's the whiskey business, Gator?

04:07.428 --> 04:09.805
You make it, Mr Simms. I haul it.

04:10.014 --> 04:15.436
Hey, boy, you ain't been drag-racin'
my sedan again, have you?

04:15.644 --> 04:18.272
Tell you what,
you keep me working on that car,

04:18.481 --> 04:21.274
you're gonna blow everybody
right out of the tub.

04:21.483 --> 04:23.944
Can I have one of those?

04:25.654 --> 04:30.659
Boy, you better get your shirt on.
You got a visitor over at the office.

04:30.868 --> 04:35.456
- Visitor?
- Your cousin. She's got bad news for you.

04:59.063 --> 05:00.523
Hello, Louella.

05:06.153 --> 05:09.031
It ain't your mama or your daddy, Gator.

05:13.202 --> 05:15.663
Donny was killed.

05:20.960 --> 05:23.212
I drove up 'cause I knew
you'd wanna know.

05:27.425 --> 05:30.219
Your mama didn't wanna come.

05:30.428 --> 05:33.305
She sends her love, Gator.

05:35.433 --> 05:38.853
Shoot! There's no way
to make it any better.

05:39.061 --> 05:43.149
Donny was killed down in Bogan County.

05:43.357 --> 05:44.984
Who killed him, Louella?

05:45.818 --> 05:48.654
They're not sure.

05:48.863 --> 05:53.159
They found him in the lake. There was
another kid from school with him.

05:53.367 --> 05:58.247
I don't know what the hell you're talking
about. Donny didn't run liquor.

05:58.456 --> 06:01.709
Your daddy thinks
it was on account of the sheriff.

06:04.587 --> 06:09.383
- The sheriff?
- He thinks it was on account of...

06:09.592 --> 06:12.428
...kids he hung out with.

06:12.636 --> 06:15.514
All them protesting.

06:16.640 --> 06:19.226
All them damn hippies.

06:34.825 --> 06:38.454
Gator! How long you gonna sit there, boy?

06:40.039 --> 06:45.503
Five days. Mr Simms said you go
and get yourself on over to the shop.

06:46.462 --> 06:48.756
Mr Simms done give you
every break there is

06:48.964 --> 06:52.176
and all you
son of a guns think you got to do

06:52.385 --> 06:58.641
is just make moonshine liquor and don't
give a damn about nothin' or nobody...

09:01.263 --> 09:03.933
Gator, where in the hell
you think you're goin'?

09:10.856 --> 09:15.444
Look like you gonna dig me a ditch
all the way to Memphis, Gator.

09:19.949 --> 09:24.954
You did your time pretty good up to here.
You only got one more year to go.

09:25.162 --> 09:28.249
Two ways you can do it: hard or easy.

09:31.669 --> 09:34.839
Bill, get them boys started
about 50 yards on up the field.

09:35.047 --> 09:37.091
Move it out.

09:39.051 --> 09:41.512
Put down that shovel.

09:43.639 --> 09:49.186
You listen to me, boy.
Ain't nothin' you, I or anybody else can do.

09:49.395 --> 09:53.524
Your brother's dead
and you ain't goin' home for another year.

09:56.485 --> 09:59.280
You can do your time easy,
that's all I'm saying.

09:59.488 --> 10:02.658
I've seen a hell of a lot
of old boys come and go.

10:02.867 --> 10:05.369
Captain.

10:07.121 --> 10:10.374
- Federal law got me in here, didn't it?
- What'd you say?

10:10.583 --> 10:14.378
I said the federal law
got me in here, didn't it?

10:14.587 --> 10:18.716
- You reckon it can get me out?
- What are you drivin' at?

10:20.634 --> 10:22.887
Sheriff in Bogan County, what's his name?

10:23.095 --> 10:25.139
J C Connors?

10:26.640 --> 10:30.394
You know he's taking money
from the whiskey business, don't you?

10:39.945 --> 10:42.740
I'll get evidence against him.

10:42.948 --> 10:44.992
JC?

10:46.577 --> 10:49.455
Boy, he runs Bogan County.

10:51.123 --> 10:56.337
Yeah. But I'll nail his ass.

10:57.797 --> 11:01.342
Let those reports go for now
and wait outside.

11:01.550 --> 11:07.181
Gator, this is Mr Cantrell.
Mr Cantrell, it's your wingding.

11:07.390 --> 11:10.643
Sit down, Mr McKlusky.

11:10.851 --> 11:15.356
Mr Simms tells us you want to cooperate
with the federal department.

11:15.564 --> 11:18.067
Is that correct?

11:18.275 --> 11:20.277
Yeah.

11:20.486 --> 11:24.073
Let's see.
12 months remaining in your sentence.

11:24.281 --> 11:28.244
Second offence: making and transporting
untaxed whiskey.

11:28.452 --> 11:30.496
- As you understand...
- Third.

11:30.705 --> 11:33.624
- I beg your pardon?
- Third offence.

11:33.833 --> 11:37.670
First time I was 13.

11:37.878 --> 11:40.548
Yeah.

11:40.756 --> 11:47.430
If information related to federal income-tax
evasion or unpaid liquor tax is obtained,

11:47.638 --> 11:51.892
it's within the policy of the government
to cooperate with state-prison officials.

11:52.101 --> 11:57.314
We have a file on the Bogan County
sheriff. He's a damn tough cookie.

11:57.523 --> 12:02.028
He's got several unsolved homicides going
for him, as well as other circumstances.

12:02.236 --> 12:07.074
But our jurisdiction is only the manufacture
of untaxed, illegal whiskey.

12:07.283 --> 12:10.411
If you haul from an illegal steal,
that's direct evidence.

12:10.619 --> 12:13.247
If you see he receives money,
that's direct evidence.

12:13.456 --> 12:17.710
If you can testify as to money paid
to the sheriff's department, that's evidence.

12:17.918 --> 12:22.715
If you can determine the actual location
of illegal, unreported income,

12:22.923 --> 12:25.009
that is a federal case.

12:25.217 --> 12:27.261
Do you understand?

12:35.811 --> 12:38.230
Well? Gonna miss it, McKlusky?

12:38.439 --> 12:41.525
Gosh, yes. I'm gonna miss
all that good cooking.

12:41.734 --> 12:44.028
Pay attention.

12:45.029 --> 12:48.741
This is Dude Watson.
He's your contact man in Bogan County.

12:48.949 --> 12:52.828
Right now you can find him
driving down at the Benton Speedway.

12:53.037 --> 12:56.791
Read this file. All of it.

13:01.587 --> 13:03.881
Bye, boys. Have a good time.

13:12.598 --> 13:14.433
- McKlusky?
- Yeah.

13:14.642 --> 13:16.852
Over here.

13:17.061 --> 13:19.397
There it is. Take a look at it.

13:19.605 --> 13:22.983
This is the car you'll do
your whiskey running in.

13:25.778 --> 13:28.656
- Who tuned it?
- D'you like it?

13:28.864 --> 13:31.951
Doggone! Would you look at that motor!

13:32.159 --> 13:36.122
The guy who did it's one of our boys.
He used to do a little running.

13:36.330 --> 13:38.374
Watson operates a garage.

13:38.582 --> 13:43.421
- We've got him on federal probation, so...
- Would you look at that engine...

13:43.629 --> 13:47.717
We've got him on federal probation,
therefore he'll help you.

13:47.925 --> 13:50.386
- Is that it?
- Good luck.

13:52.471 --> 13:54.515
- See you, fella.
- Yeah.

13:56.267 --> 13:58.936
Keep that thing between the ditches.

16:09.775 --> 16:11.819
Gator?

16:12.236 --> 16:15.114
Gator? Gator.

16:15.698 --> 16:18.617
Gator McKlusky. Sherry Lynne.

16:18.826 --> 16:21.495
- Sherry Lynne, how are you, darlin'?
- Hi there.

16:21.704 --> 16:25.124
- I know you. What's your name?
- I'm Becky-Jo's little sister.

16:25.332 --> 16:28.711
Last time I saw you, you were flat-chested.

16:28.919 --> 16:31.088
- This is Kip.
- Gator's a funny name.

16:31.297 --> 16:35.009
Kip's a funny name, too.
Here's one for the kipper.

16:35.217 --> 16:38.012
- Where have you been?
- I've been saving myself, darlin'.

16:38.220 --> 16:39.555
<i>For what?</i>

16:39.764 --> 16:41.766
All right, all right!

16:41.974 --> 16:44.226
- Gator what?
- Gator anything you like.

16:44.435 --> 16:46.979
- I'm trying to talk.
- I wanna know his name.

16:47.188 --> 16:52.735
- You get me excited, I'll eat you up.
- You going to see your mama and papa?

16:52.943 --> 16:57.239
<i>You tell your mama...</i>

17:18.426 --> 17:20.054
Gator?

17:20.262 --> 17:22.306
Hello, Papa.

17:30.898 --> 17:32.274
Oh!

17:35.945 --> 17:38.781
Hello, Mama.

17:38.989 --> 17:42.743
I would have written more, Mama,
but I didn't know what to say.

17:42.952 --> 17:45.413
That's what Donny used to say...

17:47.123 --> 17:50.209
What do you think you might do now, son?

17:53.629 --> 17:57.550
- What happened to Donny?
- Don't you go hauling no more liquor.

17:57.758 --> 18:01.220
- I ain't.
- You think you might get a job at Rexville?

18:03.556 --> 18:06.017
What happened to Donny, Mama?

18:07.268 --> 18:10.396
We don't know.

18:10.604 --> 18:15.776
I don't want nothin' to happen to you,
Bobby. I just can't stand it no more.

18:15.985 --> 18:20.281
- Tell her it's gonna be all right.
- Whatever you got in your head, get it out!

18:20.489 --> 18:25.077
- It's gonna be all right.
- "Settle yourself. " No.

18:25.286 --> 18:27.538
- That's what Donny said.
- Now, hush.

18:27.747 --> 18:31.250
There's no call for that.
Now quit it! Come on.

18:31.459 --> 18:34.170
Gator's home. He had supper with us.

18:34.378 --> 18:37.798
We're sitting out here on the porch
like we always did.

18:40.301 --> 18:44.096
I don't rightly know
what happened to your brother, son.

18:44.305 --> 18:48.476
I don't understand it.
He wasn't mixed up in the law no way.

18:49.477 --> 18:53.105
But you know what they say
college kids do these days.

18:54.607 --> 18:56.650
But it's all right.

18:59.904 --> 19:02.990
You're home now. We can get in that crop.

19:06.202 --> 19:08.662
When are you leaving?

19:10.373 --> 19:13.042
In the morning.

19:13.250 --> 19:15.294
Where are you going, son?

19:17.129 --> 19:19.173
Where are you going?

19:24.887 --> 19:27.223
- Bogan County.
- You listen to your daddy.

19:27.431 --> 19:30.643
Stay away from there.
Don't get us mixed up in more trouble.

19:30.851 --> 19:33.938
Know how I got out of prison, Daddy?

19:35.981 --> 19:38.025
The law. The law let me out.

19:39.652 --> 19:42.738
What do you mean, son?

19:43.781 --> 19:50.996
That sheriff, he owns Bogan County.
We ain't gonna get him for killing Donny.

19:51.205 --> 19:56.419
The only way you're gonna get
that sheriff... is for taking whiskey money.

19:58.838 --> 20:00.881
Are you goin' for the federal laws?

20:02.299 --> 20:04.927
Taking names of liquor people
and turning them in?

20:05.136 --> 20:08.264
- I'm gonna get that sheriff.
- Taking names, that's...

20:08.472 --> 20:11.267
I'm gonna get that sheriff.

20:21.360 --> 20:23.446
It's a bad thing, Bobby.

21:31.305 --> 21:33.349
Howdy.

21:33.557 --> 21:35.935
Say, how are you?

21:36.143 --> 21:38.437
You Dude Watson?

21:38.646 --> 21:41.899
That's what they call me.

21:42.108 --> 21:45.861
- I hear you're a hell of a mechanic.
- Oh, yeah?

21:46.070 --> 21:49.490
Shoot. Well, I don't know.

21:49.699 --> 21:54.745
You wanna... tune up my old iron here?

21:54.954 --> 21:58.290
What, today? No way.

22:01.794 --> 22:04.714
- You got a big race today, have you?
- You know it.

22:04.922 --> 22:07.842
- Can I have a little tap of that?
- What's that?

22:08.050 --> 22:11.137
That's moon, ain't it, pard?

22:12.763 --> 22:15.599
Is that what that is?
Shoot. I was wondering.

22:15.808 --> 22:19.437
Some old boy come by about an hour ago,
just left it there.

22:19.645 --> 22:23.274
Hell, it's yours.
I don't know what the hell it is.

22:27.403 --> 22:29.447
You think I'm the fuzz?

22:29.655 --> 22:31.699
I don't know what you are.

That shine'll blind you, boy.

My name's Gator McKlusky.
You know why I'm here, don't you?

22:47.339 --> 22:51.344
I said you know why I'm here, don't you?

22:51.552 --> 22:54.722
Last year you made $18,000,

22:54.930 --> 22:59.352
working on cars and running
moonshine whiskey to your neighbours.

23:00.186 --> 23:04.607
Except you neglected to pay
Uncle Sam the taxes.

23:04.815 --> 23:10.154
He's pissed off about that.
Man, is he pissed off about that!

<i>Warm your cars up and get 'em ready
to go and get used to the track.</i>

23:22.208 --> 23:27.004
So, I'm gonna help you make some
deliveries, take down a few names.

23:27.213 --> 23:30.007
Is that right? Tell me somethin'.

23:30.216 --> 23:34.220
Why mess with an old boy who's just tryin'
to make a livin' out of liquor?

23:34.428 --> 23:38.933
I'm only gonna nail one guy's hide:
J C Connors.

23:39.141 --> 23:42.103
J C Connors? Shoot!

23:42.311 --> 23:48.150
You might as well try to swim over to
China and get old Mao Tse-tung. Bye-bye.

23:58.035 --> 24:03.374
- You're thirsty.
- You got the best shine in town, Maggie.

<i>Fill it up.</i>

<i>Did you hear about James?
He got so bombed on this stuff,</i>

- Not any hotter than what's holdin' them.
- You behave yourself.

24:24.395 --> 24:27.064
- See you next week.
- Bye, sugar.

- Open the door, dammit!
- That was a dumb thing to do.

25:08.898 --> 25:13.486
- What's going on out here?
- Go on back in the house.

25:13.694 --> 25:17.198
Sharon Anne,
what are you doing out here?

25:17.406 --> 25:21.118
Give me back my gun.
That's my gun. Give it back to me.

25:21.327 --> 25:24.455
Don't ever take a man's gun.
What's the matter with you?

25:24.663 --> 25:28.250
Look what you did to the stock!
And look at that.

25:28.459 --> 25:30.669
Who the hell's gonna fix my ceiling? You?

25:30.878 --> 25:33.964
- Will you just calm down?
- Don't tell me to calm down!

- No damn federal stool-pigeon is gonna...
- Don't call me that.

Take a bite of this.
It'll make you feel better.

Get the hell away from me, man.

that drowned in the lake?

26:20.302 --> 26:22.763
You didn't have to hit me in the gut, man.

26:22.972 --> 26:26.058
- One of them boys was my brother.
- I'm sick.

26:26.267 --> 26:31.814
- I said one of them kids was my brother.
- I said you didn't have to hit me in the gut!

26:32.023 --> 26:34.775
No sheriff is gonna kill
any brother of mine.

26:34.984 --> 26:38.529
- Well, go hit him in the gut, not me!
- You didn't even know him.

26:38.738 --> 26:43.367
Know him? I've known him since
I was a kid. He's been the sheriff here.

26:43.576 --> 26:46.370
Not the sheriff!
I'm talking about my brother!

26:50.624 --> 26:53.502
<i>Hey, Maggie.</i>

26:56.172 --> 26:59.592
Henry, why don't you just bring it out
in broad daylight?

26:59.800 --> 27:03.262
I told you I want one gallon in there
and the rest outsideways.

27:03.471 --> 27:07.516
Them feds ain't comin' to get you, honey.
Unless they wanna reckon with me.

27:07.725 --> 27:10.186
Who the hell's that?

27:17.526 --> 27:20.863
Who does he haul for?

27:26.660 --> 27:32.083
- You better start answering my questions.
- I don't have to tell you a damn thing.

27:32.291 --> 27:37.213
- I'm on probation.
- You broke probation.

27:37.421 --> 27:41.092
You know it and I know it and so do they.

27:41.300 --> 27:44.887
If you don't answer my questions,
they'll send you back to prison.

27:45.096 --> 27:49.308
You're not gonna see your kids or your
wife no more. Now, answer my questions.

27:49.517 --> 27:51.560
Lookee, man.

27:52.812 --> 27:57.024
I ain't got no damn love for J C Connors.

27:57.233 --> 28:01.028
But I can't help you. Even if I could,
it wouldn't do you any good.

28:01.237 --> 28:05.908
If I got you in to run liquor, make liquor,
what good's it gonna do you?

28:06.117 --> 28:11.038
For gettin' court proof, legal stuff like that,
you ain't gonna make it.

28:12.164 --> 28:15.334
I pay J C Connors, sure. Everybody does.

28:15.543 --> 28:19.755
But it's cash money, man.
It's in a paper sack. Ain't no cheques.

28:19.964 --> 28:25.678
And them tax boys put me on a stand
in front of a damn jury, I'm gonna lie.

28:25.886 --> 28:28.139
I'm gonna have to.

28:28.347 --> 28:33.519
Five years in a federal pen is no picnic,
but J C Connors can put me under.

28:33.728 --> 28:36.814
You understand what I'm saying to you?

28:44.655 --> 28:50.369
If you wanna get that sheriff, man...
you're gonna have to kill him.

28:50.578 --> 28:54.623
<i>- Do you want me to put that on your tab?
- Yeah, if you still trust me.</i>

28:54.832 --> 28:57.918
<i>Trust you? No way.</i>

29:03.132 --> 29:06.469
Ain't this some beautiful mess?

29:06.677 --> 29:10.931
Five years in the pen one way,
and J C Connors the other.

29:21.400 --> 29:23.235
You gotta help me, Dude.

29:26.864 --> 29:28.699
You gotta help me.

29:40.711 --> 29:44.840
A court-house right in the middle
of the city square.

29:45.049 --> 29:48.427
I like that.
You don't hardly see that any more.

29:48.636 --> 29:51.389
- That is the court-house?
- No, it's a pool hall.

29:51.597 --> 29:54.684
Court-house is across the street over here.

29:59.063 --> 30:03.150
Legalise that shit,
it's gonna ruin moonshine liquor for ever.

30:03.359 --> 30:07.196
Them long-haired hippy freaks.
Pot-smoking bastards...

30:08.239 --> 30:10.741
- What say, sis?
- Hey, Dude.

30:14.578 --> 30:16.247
Ha!

30:20.334 --> 30:25.673
- What say, Ray, TR?
- Old Dirty Dude's back in town.

30:25.881 --> 30:28.592
- How you boys doin'?
- Pretty good. How are you?

30:28.801 --> 30:32.430
- You need anybody to do some runnin'?
- Not right now.

30:32.638 --> 30:36.308
Old Roy's out back. He may need
somebody to run blocker for him.

30:36.517 --> 30:38.394
Yeah?

30:38.602 --> 30:40.646
Take it easy.

30:42.732 --> 30:46.193
- Hey, Roy.
- What say, Dude?

30:46.402 --> 30:48.904
- How's that old race car?
- Better than yours.

30:49.113 --> 30:53.409
I want you to meet somebody.
Gator McKlusky, this is Roy Boone.

30:53.617 --> 30:58.164
Gator, huh? That's a mighty funny name.

30:58.372 --> 31:05.087
Rebel Roy. Knew an old boy back home
with Rebel Roy on his car. A drivin' fool.

31:05.296 --> 31:07.882
Run old Junior Johnson
off the road one time.

31:08.090 --> 31:13.429
Bull. Ain't nobody ever rode
old Junior Johnson off the road, boy.

31:13.637 --> 31:18.309
- Wanna shoot some pool?
- No, I got Sugar Puddin' waitin' out there.

31:18.517 --> 31:24.357
Had Rebel Roy on the side of the car.
Hell of a football player. Rebel Bookman.

31:24.565 --> 31:28.194
Every time he won a race,
he'd yell out the rebel yell. Yee-up!

31:30.071 --> 31:32.740
Rack 'em up, will you?

31:35.951 --> 31:40.373
Dude, why don't you come on outside
and say hello to Sugar Puddin'?

31:40.581 --> 31:43.042
She'd be glad to see you.

31:45.002 --> 31:47.588
I'd kinda like to say hello to her myself.

31:47.797 --> 31:49.840
- Rebel Roy, huh?
- Uh-huh.

31:52.009 --> 31:56.055
Roy, I understand you need somebody
to run blocker for you.

31:56.263 --> 31:58.808
No, I don't need nobody right now, Dude.

31:59.016 --> 32:02.436
- Gator's a hell of a driver.
- I know. Rebel Roy, huh?

32:02.645 --> 32:05.398
Rebel Roy, yeah.
Taught me everything I know.

32:05.606 --> 32:08.275
That's why I'm so good.

32:08.484 --> 32:11.737
- You wouldn't kid me, now, would you?
- Uh-huh.

32:11.946 --> 32:15.616
Hey, Sugar Puddin'.
This here's Gator McKlusky.

32:15.825 --> 32:18.536
Roy, come here.
I wanna show you somethin'.

32:19.870 --> 32:22.748
I'll be right back, Sugar Puddin'.

32:22.957 --> 32:25.000
Rebel Roy, huh?

32:25.209 --> 32:28.963
Good-looking rascal.
Reminds me a lot of you.

32:29.171 --> 32:32.717
Had a rebel flag, just like you got,
painted right down the hood.

32:32.925 --> 32:35.678
Doggone, that joker could drive.

32:35.886 --> 32:38.097
You wanna look at somethin', look at that.

32:38.305 --> 32:40.933
<i>Wow!</i>

32:41.142 --> 32:45.771
- You got yourself some motor there, boy.
- Sure you don't need a blocker, Roy?

32:45.980 --> 32:48.024
Well, I don't know, Dude.

32:50.067 --> 32:52.778
I might.

32:52.987 --> 32:56.198
I just might. I sure will think about it.

33:00.911 --> 33:02.955
There's your friend.

33:04.040 --> 33:06.250
- J C Connors?
- That's him.

33:08.794 --> 33:12.548
- I wanna talk to him.
- Go talk to him. I ain't botherin'.

33:12.757 --> 33:18.971
- I want you to come with me.
- Are you crazy? I'll wait here in the car.

33:23.100 --> 33:26.187
What the hell's wrong with you, man?

33:26.395 --> 33:30.858
You're gonna kill us.
Don't act so damn crazy!

33:35.446 --> 33:38.991
- What's your hurry, Dude?
- Ain't no hurry, Sheriff.

33:39.200 --> 33:43.287
- Hot, though, ain't it?
- Yeah, it's hot.

33:43.496 --> 33:46.332
Just don't make it any hotter
than it is, now.

33:46.540 --> 33:48.584
I won't.

34:08.938 --> 34:11.815
I'll have somethin' for you
on Friday, Mr Connors.

34:18.447 --> 34:21.659
I'll bet this machine'd outrun
about anything, wouldn't it?

34:21.867 --> 34:23.202
Yeah.

34:23.411 --> 34:26.914
Motorcycles and state police cars.

34:28.373 --> 34:30.668
Just about anything on the road.

34:30.876 --> 34:34.547
- It's a hot car.
- It's tuned up fine.

34:36.090 --> 34:41.137
- Only two things I'm scared of.
- Only scared of two things? What's that?

34:41.344 --> 34:45.683
- Women and the police.
- Women and the police.

34:45.891 --> 34:50.396
You spend all your time
tryin' to hump 'em both, don't you?

34:54.065 --> 34:57.153
You take it easy
in this machine in this county.

34:57.361 --> 35:01.741
- We'll take it easy, Mr Connors.
- I know you will.

35:02.658 --> 35:04.702
<i>Women and the police.</i>

35:09.999 --> 35:15.004
Boy, that was cute. I mean that was cute.

35:23.512 --> 35:27.099
- Ready?
- I was born ready.

35:27.308 --> 35:31.187
We'll take State 102,
go in past the lumber-yard.

35:31.395 --> 35:33.939
Think you can handle
that big machine all right?

35:34.148 --> 35:36.734
Get on with it.

35:36.942 --> 35:41.197
You just keep your eyes on the road
and your foot on the pedal.

35:51.207 --> 35:53.834
All right, Harvey. What does that mean?

35:54.043 --> 36:00.800
All right, JC. That means Ben Fairfield
says that county records may be...

36:01.008 --> 36:04.929
- Thank you for taking care of that matter.
- My pleasure, Judge Tainey.

36:05.137 --> 36:06.972
He says what?

36:07.181 --> 36:11.143
The county records may be placed
in investigative custody,

36:11.352 --> 36:13.896
in which case prior investigative function

36:14.105 --> 36:17.733
may be retained by local authorities
over federal jurisdiction.

36:17.942 --> 36:22.321
- Bogan County's still Bogan County.
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

36:22.530 --> 36:25.074
It's not the same. It can't be the same.

36:25.282 --> 36:30.413
That's a bunch of stuff. Ben played football
with me. He puts his pants on...

36:30.621 --> 36:34.125
- You're still coming for Sunday dinner?
- Fried chicken.

36:34.333 --> 36:39.255
Benjamin Fairfield is now a US senator
and I'm down here in Bogan County

36:39.463 --> 36:42.883
doin' the same thing his daddy did
when he was sheriff here

36:43.092 --> 36:48.264
and I had a cell downstairs 'cause I burned
down the outhouse on the Fourth of July.

36:48.472 --> 36:52.143
That was 25 years ago. Federal law
and state law's not what it was.

36:52.351 --> 36:56.063
Dammit, Harv... Excuse me, Miss Martha.

36:56.272 --> 37:00.234
- You don't believe everything you hear?
- Not workin' round here.

37:00.443 --> 37:03.654
Now, look, JC, let me
explain it to you one more time.

37:03.863 --> 37:07.324
Federal law and state law
is not what it was.

37:07.533 --> 37:10.327
Harvey, you know, you need a haircut.

37:10.536 --> 37:15.374
What's it the business of any income-tax
federal revenuer, anyway,

37:15.583 --> 37:18.377
if Pot Willoughby
and any other old moonshiner

37:18.586 --> 37:23.341
wants to put down his paper sack full
of money, like he's being doin' for years,

37:23.549 --> 37:27.928
and I take that money and spread it around
among 25 men in my department

37:28.137 --> 37:30.514
who do not make enough
to buy their wives

37:30.723 --> 37:36.604
a washer, drier and all them things every
American family is supposed to have?

37:36.812 --> 37:40.399
You tell me, Harvey,
is it better if a man pays

37:40.608 --> 37:44.445
seven dollars a fifth for
government drinking-liquor in a dry county

37:44.653 --> 37:46.697
or six bits a pint for shine?

37:46.906 --> 37:51.577
Don't argue with me, JC. I'm with you.
Everybody in the department is.

37:51.786 --> 37:55.414
- But you got to pull in your horns.
- Bull.

37:55.623 --> 38:00.753
If Ben Fairfield says that Washington's
sending a man here snooping around,

38:00.961 --> 38:05.591
he knows what he's talking about,
and maybe he's already here.

38:22.775 --> 38:25.361
If that ain't a whiskey runner, I'll spit.

38:25.569 --> 38:28.656
Hunkered down on his springs like that.

38:29.907 --> 38:31.951
- Shall we get him?
- Let's go.

38:32.159 --> 38:34.203
Kill the tape.

38:35.996 --> 38:38.040
Oh, shit!

39:12.241 --> 39:14.910
What the hell we got here?

39:56.118 --> 39:59.163
Got a whiskey transporter
and a blocker car running east.

39:59.372 --> 40:02.416
In pursuit on Farrel Road.

41:41.140 --> 41:42.558
Son of a bitch!

43:02.888 --> 43:04.724
Well, I'll be damned.

43:24.702 --> 43:26.454
Hey, Gator.

43:26.662 --> 43:31.709
Guy in the body shop wants to know what
you did to the undercarriage on that car.

43:31.917 --> 43:37.798
- I told you, I just dinged it up a little bit.
- Gonna ding your pocketbook.

43:38.007 --> 43:40.968
That's her, the one
in the yellow dress up there.

43:51.937 --> 43:53.981
- Hi.
- Hi.

43:54.190 --> 43:56.025
Court-house closed?

43:56.233 --> 44:00.654
The sheriff's office is open,
but that court is closed for the day.

44:00.863 --> 44:06.118
- Where you get your licence renewed?
- The vehicle department closes at 5.30.

44:06.327 --> 44:08.454
Dammit!

44:08.662 --> 44:11.207
Sorry.

44:11.415 --> 44:15.086
They close at 5.30. It's after 5.30 now.

44:15.294 --> 44:17.755
Gonna be in trouble now.

44:23.094 --> 44:25.805
When did your licence expire?

44:28.265 --> 44:31.519
February. That's my birthday.

44:34.605 --> 44:37.233
- I guess I'm gonna catch hell.
- No.

44:37.441 --> 44:40.820
They don't even fine you
or anything like that.

44:41.028 --> 44:44.573
You just renew it and that's all.

44:46.409 --> 44:51.163
- Do you work up in the court-house?
- I work at the sheriff's office.

44:51.372 --> 44:55.584
- That's good.
- You don't have a lot of tickets, do you?

44:55.793 --> 45:00.172
No. I just wanna get my licence renewed.

45:01.716 --> 45:05.219
- What time does the court-house open?
- Nine o'clock.

45:06.846 --> 45:12.101
I'm gonna have to stay here all night.
Do you know where I can get supper?

45:13.352 --> 45:18.065
- Right down there at the Citadel Café.
- Any good?

45:18.274 --> 45:21.819
Oh, yeah.
They got a real nice dining room.

45:23.487 --> 45:26.574
I know you're gonna think
this is dumb, but...

45:27.700 --> 45:29.952
...I hate to eat alone.

45:30.161 --> 45:34.040
You know somethin'?
I hate to eat alone, too.

45:34.248 --> 45:36.500
Yeah?

45:36.709 --> 45:38.753
Come on.

45:42.214 --> 45:44.258
<i>No.</i>

45:46.218 --> 45:49.722
Listen, I know you.

45:49.930 --> 45:51.974
No, you don't.

45:53.684 --> 45:56.145
I got an idea, honey.

45:58.814 --> 46:02.568
I just want a goodnight kiss.

46:02.777 --> 46:05.237
- You sure?
- Lay one on me.

46:05.446 --> 46:09.075
No, I don't think so. I'm not so sure.

46:19.043 --> 46:22.797
Oh, honey. You're too much.

46:28.219 --> 46:35.476
Honey, I know that you want me to dig out
a lot of tickets or somethin' like that.

46:35.685 --> 46:39.855
And, honey, there ain't a chance.
No chance.

46:42.024 --> 46:44.652
What tickets?

46:44.860 --> 46:49.573
I ain't got no tickets!
What the hell you talking about tickets?

46:49.782 --> 46:52.326
That ain't what I want at all!

46:52.535 --> 46:56.288
<i>Ow! Son of a...</i>

46:57.415 --> 47:01.210
Thank you, Maggie. When are you gonna
leave that old boy and marry me?

47:01.419 --> 47:03.462
Sugar, you ain't asked me.

47:03.671 --> 47:06.841
Dude, don't you want another piece of pie?

47:07.049 --> 47:09.510
No, I don't want any pie.

47:11.303 --> 47:13.639
Well, what do you think?

47:13.848 --> 47:17.351
I can jerk the head,
but I can't give it to you before Tuesday.

47:17.560 --> 47:20.855
Ain't there someplace around here
you can find that's open?

47:21.063 --> 47:24.734
- I gotta make a pick-up at Big Bear's.
- Let Gator do it for you.

47:24.942 --> 47:27.236
You said he's the best blocker
you ever had.

47:27.445 --> 47:32.616
I can't understand that damn pushing rod
going out on me like that! Damn!

47:32.825 --> 47:35.870
- How you doin'?
- Everybody I can.

47:36.078 --> 47:40.833
Big Bear just might kick my butt
if I take you out there to make a pick-up.

47:41.042 --> 47:45.212
- I could sure use the money.
- Don't look like I got much of a choice.

47:47.340 --> 47:51.385
- Roy, it'll be all right.
- Hell, what do you know?

47:51.594 --> 47:54.263
Damn! I hate to mess up
a man's car like that.

47:54.472 --> 47:56.599
You can fix it back, can't you?

47:56.807 --> 47:59.894
Pick me up some new licence plates.

48:32.134 --> 48:33.761
Come on back.

48:33.969 --> 48:36.263
Is that Roy?

48:36.472 --> 48:39.767
Yeah. He's got Lou and a fella with him.

48:43.854 --> 48:48.442
- Who is it? Harry Noonan?
- I don't know. Honey, be still.

48:53.406 --> 48:59.286
You know, I never heard of no Roy Goober
runnin' whiskey round Martinsville.

48:59.495 --> 49:03.749
Yeah? He's my cousin.
Everybody's heard of him.

49:03.958 --> 49:09.255
- Who'd you say he was? Gator what?
- McKlusky.

49:09.463 --> 49:13.342
- You sure you know who he is?
- Hell, Big Bear. Gator's all right.

49:13.551 --> 49:16.137
I threw a rod on my car.

49:16.345 --> 49:20.349
Well, you boys let that be. He'll finish it up.

49:20.558 --> 49:22.810
Come on in and eat a bite.

49:23.019 --> 49:27.481
That's a good idea. I'm so hungry I could
eat the tail-end out of a hobby-horse.

49:28.482 --> 49:32.737
- You got a hell of an operation here.
- I got 15 men piddling around.

49:32.945 --> 49:35.948
If I didn't give 'em something to do,
they'd be sucking wind.

49:36.157 --> 49:38.659
How many gallons do you run a month?

49:38.868 --> 49:40.911
- 3,000 or so.
- Whoo!

49:43.372 --> 49:46.876
- We fit our stacks different.
- We gotta keep 'em out of sight.

49:47.084 --> 49:51.547
The feds have got TV doodads, helicopters
and every other thing snoopin' around.

49:51.756 --> 49:56.302
Like a bunch of old hens scratching
a manure pile for sunflower seeds.

49:58.471 --> 50:03.017
You can eat my grub.
I'll let you haul my whiskey.

50:03.225 --> 50:05.811
But don't you ever do me no wrong!

50:06.937 --> 50:09.690
How would you like that knife
shoved up your ass?

50:14.712 --> 50:16.756
I wouldn't like that at all.

50:22.053 --> 50:24.514
Let's go eat some greens.

50:28.643 --> 50:32.021
But you remember what I told you.

50:45.910 --> 50:50.290
<i>That smells so nice, that honeysuckle.</i>

50:53.418 --> 50:56.170
Gator, tell me somethin'.

50:56.379 --> 51:01.759
Was you scared back there when old
Big Bear pulled that pigsticker on you?

51:01.968 --> 51:04.012
Scared shitless.

51:05.513 --> 51:07.557
I knew it.

51:08.766 --> 51:11.894
- Gonna hate to see old Big Bear leave.
- Why's that?

51:12.103 --> 51:15.898
Good old boy like him. Fought in the war,
like his daddy before him.

51:16.107 --> 51:19.360
He says if the government keeps
dogging him about moonshine,

51:19.569 --> 51:22.030
he'd as soon turn communist
and be a Chinaman.

51:22.238 --> 51:25.325
I believe that old boy'd do it, too.

51:49.974 --> 51:53.061
Another day, another quarter.

52:12.538 --> 52:16.000
What did you do with all that money
you got for singing lessons?

52:16.209 --> 52:20.964
That isn't fair. I was imitating that old lady
I was telling you about up on the float.

52:21.172 --> 52:24.384
We was up on the float, too.
They even took pictures.

52:24.592 --> 52:27.553
<i>In the Bogan County Star.
Maybe you saw those pictures?</i>

52:27.762 --> 52:31.724
We had to dive in the water
and go from one side to the other side.

52:31.933 --> 52:35.937
Whoever got to the other side first
won fine gifts: hair goods...

52:36.145 --> 52:39.399
Wasn't it around here
where those people were drowned?

52:39.607 --> 52:43.152
- This where them two boys was drowned?
- Just past the point.

52:43.361 --> 52:46.698
- What boys are you talking about?
- Never mind.

52:48.283 --> 52:51.452
Anyway, I could have won
that race, right, Roy?

52:51.661 --> 52:55.331
But Bonnie Rae Slocum grabbed
the back of my bra and held on to me.

52:55.540 --> 52:58.001
It might have changed our life if I'd won.

52:58.209 --> 53:01.337
Roy would be an engineer
if he'd just gone on to school.

53:01.546 --> 53:05.300
Ever since we were going steady
I wanted him to study engineering.

53:05.508 --> 53:10.597
We could have had children and a home
and a house and everything nice.

53:10.805 --> 53:15.685
If you keep running that white lightning,
you're gonna get caught, sent to prison...

53:15.893 --> 53:20.857
Shoot, it'd just be probation.
There ain't nobody gonna turn me in, hon.

53:21.065 --> 53:23.359
- First time's probation.
- Second time.

53:23.568 --> 53:26.946
You already had your probation
that time up in Crescent County.

53:27.155 --> 53:30.408
- That don't count. I was 16 years old.
- It does too count!

53:30.617 --> 53:33.828
- Shoot.
- It does. Doesn't it count?

53:34.037 --> 53:36.789
What's the matter with you?

53:36.998 --> 53:39.876
You two are more fun
than going to an all-night dentist.

53:40.251 --> 53:44.505
Sowing in the morning
sowing seeds of kindness

53:44.714 --> 53:48.885
Sowing in the noontide and the dewy eve

53:49.093 --> 53:53.640
Waiting for the harvest
and the time for reaping

53:53.848 --> 53:56.184
We shall come rejoicing...

53:56.392 --> 53:59.437
What you always writing
in that little book about?

53:59.646 --> 54:03.858
- I'm writing the story of my life, darlin'.
- Yeah?

54:04.067 --> 54:06.945
- Am I in it?
- You're working on it.

54:09.155 --> 54:12.825
The first little old boy I ever took out
in back of the corn crib,

54:13.034 --> 54:16.162
he wasn't but nine years old.

54:16.371 --> 54:18.414
Nine years old?

54:20.166 --> 54:23.294
I was reading this magazine article
the other day.

54:23.503 --> 54:28.049
It said your average girl doesn't start
even playing with herself till she's 12.

54:33.680 --> 54:36.599
I was early.

54:40.895 --> 54:43.940
I sure admire them folks.

54:44.148 --> 54:50.154
Bought 'em a damn organ
outta that whiskey money. How about that?

54:50.363 --> 54:52.407
Hey, Roy.

54:53.324 --> 54:56.619
- You better pop, Gator.
- Remember what I said.

54:56.828 --> 55:00.415
- What'd she say?
- I gave him my recipe for shaky puddin'.

55:00.623 --> 55:05.253
- Shaky puddin'?
- He said he'd like to try some.

55:08.798 --> 55:12.051
Hey, bubba. Keep that door open, boy.

55:12.260 --> 55:14.304
Bring it inside, Roy.

55:20.351 --> 55:23.021
What are you thinkin' about?

55:25.898 --> 55:27.942
Shaky puddin'.

55:30.153 --> 55:32.196
Gonna try some?

55:34.365 --> 55:37.035
I'm thinkin' about it.

55:39.704 --> 55:45.418
Gator, I don't believe
in foolin' around none. Never did.

55:45.627 --> 55:50.632
If you want it, just say so. If you don't...

55:50.840 --> 55:54.844
- What about Roy?
- He's not gonna be watchin' us, is he?

55:56.638 --> 56:01.559
- I hope not.
- Keep the fires burnin'. See you.

56:02.685 --> 56:05.772
Roy's runnin' a little late tonight, ain't he?

56:07.857 --> 56:10.318
Who's that new guy
he's got runnin' with him?

56:12.820 --> 56:15.365
African trip?

56:15.573 --> 56:20.161
Blank, blank, F, A, blank, blank.

56:20.370 --> 56:26.584
Put that crossword puzzle down, see
if you can act like an officer of the law.

56:34.092 --> 56:40.598
Safari. S-A-F-A-R-I.

56:40.807 --> 56:44.310
Pretty soon there'll be
more guns than people.

56:44.519 --> 56:48.940
- Why should anybody want a gun?
- To protect themselves.

56:49.148 --> 56:52.485
If we'd stuck it out,
we could have got us one of them.

56:52.694 --> 56:56.656
I'm gonna get me one like that,
honey-bun, just like that.

57:10.628 --> 57:15.800
- I wanna protect myself.
... TV violence, movies, the whole bit.

57:16.009 --> 57:19.178
I wouldn't know what to do
with a gun if I had one.

57:19.387 --> 57:24.601
- That's a typical female statement.
- Are you attacking females now?

57:30.106 --> 57:36.404
The army goes round busting people for
smoking dope and then they kill them.

57:36.613 --> 57:40.325
- Do y'all go to school round here?
- No. Do you?

57:40.533 --> 57:44.912
- No, I'm out of school.
- We need a woman president.

57:48.374 --> 57:53.713
If they elected a woman president,
there wouldn't be any more wars.

57:56.299 --> 58:00.386
You don't believe me? You know the name
of that stuff they put in hot dogs?

58:00.595 --> 58:05.266
No, I don't know. Y'all know anybody
who goes out to Horacebee College?

58:05.475 --> 58:08.186
No, we're from Dowton Junior College.

58:08.394 --> 58:12.982
- Do you have people from Horacebee?
- I used to.

58:15.777 --> 58:18.237
Let's go.

58:18.446 --> 58:20.490
Cradle-robber.

58:26.204 --> 58:28.414
What were you talking to them about?

58:28.623 --> 58:33.002
- Trying to hustle up a hippy chick?
- Yeah.

58:33.211 --> 58:37.799
Why you talkin' to them draft-dodging,
pot-smoking sons of bitches?

58:38.007 --> 58:41.719
They don't know nothin'.
All they do is cause dissension.

58:41.928 --> 58:44.430
Ain't never worked a day in their lives.

58:44.639 --> 58:49.018
Must be 50 of 'em. If it was up to me,
I'd shoot 'em all.

58:49.227 --> 58:53.273
Bringing in the sheaves
Bringing in the sheaves

58:53.481 --> 58:57.944
<i>Bringing in the sheaves
Bringing in the sheaves</i>

58:58.152 --> 59:03.074
We shall come rejoicing
Bringing in the sheaves

59:03.283 --> 59:09.580
Bringing in the sheaves...
Bringing in the sheaves

59:13.543 --> 59:18.423
We shall come rejoicing
Bringing in the sheaves

59:29.934 --> 59:31.978
Bringing in the sheaves

59:38.443 --> 59:40.528
Hey.

59:40.737 --> 59:42.363
- Mornin'.
- Mornin'.

59:42.572 --> 59:44.157
Mornin'.

59:44.365 --> 59:47.452
- Would you like a bite?
- Uh-huh.

59:47.660 --> 59:50.288
Come on up here and get it.

59:51.181 --> 59:52.515
Where's Roy?

59:55.810 --> 59:58.271
He's inside. Sleeping.

01:00:10.659 --> 01:00:15.413
- You do that all by yourself?
- All by myself. Just for you.

01:00:20.168 --> 01:00:22.462
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

01:00:22.671 --> 01:00:25.090
- You like that?
- Beats prison cookin'.

01:00:25.298 --> 01:00:28.468
- You was in prison?
- Mm-hm.

01:00:28.677 --> 01:00:31.846
Doin' my time.

01:00:32.055 --> 01:00:34.474
- You know what?
- What?

01:00:34.683 --> 01:00:36.726
I wanna thank you

01:00:36.935 --> 01:00:42.065
from the bottom
of my worthless, horny little soul.

01:00:42.274 --> 01:00:45.360
I believe that.

01:00:45.569 --> 01:00:48.280
- How long was you in for?
- Four years.

01:00:51.575 --> 01:00:54.411
How come is you out?

01:00:54.619 --> 01:00:56.162
Ow!

01:00:56.371 --> 01:00:59.708
'Cause they got tired of me.

01:00:59.916 --> 01:01:06.548
If you keep runnin' that white liquor, you're
just gonna go right back in there again.

01:01:06.756 --> 01:01:09.426
Not this boy.

01:01:09.634 --> 01:01:12.095
- Tell you what.
- What?

01:01:13.555 --> 01:01:19.019
You come on in here and wash my back,
I'll buy you a new dress come pay-day.

01:01:20.353 --> 01:01:22.397
- A new dress?
- Mm-hm.

01:01:44.377 --> 01:01:47.047
<i>Sh.</i>

01:01:47.255 --> 01:01:49.299
Lou?

01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:54.554
Lou!

01:02:15.867 --> 01:02:18.245
Damn people wanderin' off.

01:02:18.453 --> 01:02:21.873
Now I know why they call you Gator.

01:02:24.793 --> 01:02:29.881
I have a signed affidavit here.
Against my client who was issued...

01:02:30.090 --> 01:02:32.133
JC.

01:02:37.222 --> 01:02:41.059
There it is. Ben Fairfield got that
out of the CID section.

01:02:41.268 --> 01:02:45.522
Dude Watson and some stool-pigeon
they turned loose out of state prison.

01:02:45.730 --> 01:02:47.857
- You better start backtracking.
- Dude?

01:02:48.066 --> 01:02:53.029
It's there in black and white. The federals
have got him over a barrel on taxes.

01:02:53.238 --> 01:02:55.949
- Taxes.
- They're after you, boy.

01:02:58.368 --> 01:03:01.997
- Turnin' a man against his own people...
- It don't matter to them.

01:03:02.205 --> 01:03:04.499
Washington DC's a damn dictator.

01:03:04.708 --> 01:03:10.046
They're gonna integrate our schools,
get all our coloureds to vote,

01:03:10.255 --> 01:03:15.302
they're gonna send all those long-haired
smart-alec hippies down here.

01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:20.473
What would we be doing if Ben Fairfield
wasn't sittin' up there pulling strings?

01:03:20.682 --> 01:03:24.060
Living in Russia.
That's what you might as well be doing.

01:03:24.269 --> 01:03:26.897
Miss Martha, excuse us.
I'm liable to get heated.

01:03:27.105 --> 01:03:30.191
- Watch your blood pressure.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:03:31.651 --> 01:03:36.239
Communism, Harvey, that's what it is.
That's plain and simple.

01:03:36.448 --> 01:03:39.326
That is plain as the nose on your face.

01:03:39.534 --> 01:03:41.578
The communists.

01:03:43.288 --> 01:03:45.957
That's what he said.
Destroy from the inside.

01:03:46.166 --> 01:03:48.627
What are you gonna do?

01:03:50.378 --> 01:03:53.256
I'm gonna get mean, Harvey.

01:03:53.465 --> 01:03:59.179
You don't understand. It can't be
the way it was. It cannot be the way it was.

01:03:59.387 --> 01:04:03.266
Don't you know there are times
that your learned opinion

01:04:03.475 --> 01:04:07.187
is about as useless as tits on a boar hog?

01:04:21.535 --> 01:04:24.663
You know who them
hog-huggers are, man? Feds.

01:04:24.871 --> 01:04:28.250
I want 'em out of here
and this whole mess over with.

01:04:28.458 --> 01:04:32.254
- How you doin', McKlusky?
- All right.

01:04:32.462 --> 01:04:35.715
Have you got anything for us?

01:04:35.924 --> 01:04:38.593
No, not yet.

01:04:38.802 --> 01:04:41.263
When?

01:04:41.471 --> 01:04:45.141
- I don't know.
- Is Dude cooperating?

01:04:48.228 --> 01:04:50.230
Yeah.

01:04:50.438 --> 01:04:54.442
Why you gotta come around here?
I told you I'd call you.

01:04:54.651 --> 01:04:57.737
- Cool it.
- What you gotta bother these people for?

01:04:59.322 --> 01:05:01.366
Let's go.

01:05:02.450 --> 01:05:05.537
Be seein' you, McKlusky. Take it easy.

01:05:17.215 --> 01:05:22.637
By the way, what are you
so dressed up for, Sugar Puddin'?

01:05:22.846 --> 01:05:25.640
When I woke up I was feelin' so fine,

01:05:25.849 --> 01:05:30.103
I just thought I'd put on
a new dress for you, Roy.

01:05:31.438 --> 01:05:33.982
Where'd you go this afternoon, Gator?

01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:36.401
- Over to Dude's.
- Did you go with him?

01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:38.653
- No.
- No.

01:05:40.530 --> 01:05:43.617
That's mighty fine
spruce and dogwood, isn't it?

01:05:49.623 --> 01:05:51.666
Hi, Huey.

01:05:55.629 --> 01:05:57.964
- You got my sugar?
- Five sacks.

01:05:58.173 --> 01:06:01.885
- Big Bear wanted eight.
- Haven't got it.

01:06:02.093 --> 01:06:06.264
- They been checkin' on us lately.
- We'll take it.

01:06:10.727 --> 01:06:12.854
Where'd you and him go this mornin'?

01:06:13.063 --> 01:06:15.732
Noplace.

01:06:15.941 --> 01:06:20.737
Big Bear hasn't paid me for the last he got,
and we're not runnin' any credit.

01:06:20.946 --> 01:06:23.532
I'll tell him. Give me some beadin' oil, too.

01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:26.868
Buck Thurmond took my last.
I won't have any till Tuesday.

01:06:27.077 --> 01:06:29.120
- Where'd you and Lou go?
- Walkin'.

01:06:29.329 --> 01:06:31.790
- It took you long enough.
- Hey.

01:06:32.958 --> 01:06:36.711
You got somethin' to say to me, say it.

01:06:43.176 --> 01:06:46.221
I don't want you lookin' at Lou no more.

01:06:46.429 --> 01:06:50.141
Let me ask you somethin'.
Just exactly what are your intentions?

01:06:50.350 --> 01:06:52.394
About what?

01:06:52.602 --> 01:06:56.898
- Are you gonna marry her or what?
- What?

01:06:57.107 --> 01:06:59.568
That's just what I thought.

01:07:04.531 --> 01:07:09.327
Marry her? What the hell has that got to do
with what we were talking about?

01:07:09.703 --> 01:07:12.330
- Where's Dude?
- I don't know.

01:07:12.539 --> 01:07:18.253
I just want him to come down
the court-house, discuss some things.

01:07:20.130 --> 01:07:25.552
Course, you can call the NAACP first,

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:30.640
<i>or the ACLU or...</i>

01:07:30.849 --> 01:07:34.936
...the CIO, the FBI or any other damn thing.

01:07:36.563 --> 01:07:40.233
- Well, he's not here.
- Well, he ain't here.

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:45.113
Maybe you'd better come with us, then.

01:07:45.322 --> 01:07:50.702
Yes, sir. I'll just get my pocketbook.

01:07:50.911 --> 01:07:54.998
You better go help her
lock the back door, I think.

01:08:11.056 --> 01:08:13.141
Let me go. Please don't.

01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:16.435
Don't. Stop it.

01:08:16.645 --> 01:08:19.356
Would you let my deputy
up from there, please?

01:08:24.986 --> 01:08:27.488
Now, where's Dude?

01:08:30.283 --> 01:08:34.955
- Where is Dude?
- He's out at his folks'.

01:08:35.162 --> 01:08:39.626
What about that guy in that brown sedan?

01:08:39.834 --> 01:08:42.295
Haulin' with Roy Boone.

01:08:42.504 --> 01:08:45.381
Thank you, honey, for your cooperation.

01:08:48.801 --> 01:08:50.845
See you later.

01:08:52.639 --> 01:08:56.100
We're givin' him stuff as sweet
as that old Hatchy River was.

01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:59.437
If you'd sweeten this hogwash up,
you'd get him up to six.

01:08:59.645 --> 01:09:02.899
You know as much about making whiskey
as a flop-eared mule.

01:09:03.108 --> 01:09:05.443
Tell 'em to sweeten it up.

01:09:05.652 --> 01:09:09.281
If I sweeten this up,
we're gonna be fired back here.

01:09:18.290 --> 01:09:22.711
Quit drinkin' that stuff. Get behind there
and help me get this stuff outta here.

01:09:22.919 --> 01:09:25.130
You been messin' around all day.

01:09:30.135 --> 01:09:34.430
Take it easy on that Ford this time.

01:09:34.639 --> 01:09:37.100
I'll let Dude work on it.

01:09:38.350 --> 01:09:40.395
Stop nippin' on that jug.

01:09:40.604 --> 01:09:44.816
If you don't start making it better,
I'm gonna quit drinkin' it altogether.

01:09:46.443 --> 01:09:48.486
Keep your eyes on that popper keg.

01:09:48.694 --> 01:09:52.991
I don't care if it gets a little too short. We're
not making this stuff for the government.

01:09:55.744 --> 01:09:59.247
Take them back there.
Like a pile of maggots in the outhouse.

01:09:59.456 --> 01:10:02.500
- You better be glad you got me.
- Where's that Gator?

01:10:02.709 --> 01:10:06.046
Hell, I don't know.
Shaking the dew off his lily, I guess.

01:10:11.259 --> 01:10:13.261
I'll be back in a minute.

01:10:13.470 --> 01:10:17.098
You get them jugs
outta here like I told you.

01:10:24.606 --> 01:10:26.441
- Hi.
- What?

01:10:26.650 --> 01:10:30.987
You really like them electric hair-driers?
Must make your head hot.

01:10:31.196 --> 01:10:34.157
With all them chemicals,
you're gonna ruin your hair.

01:10:35.742 --> 01:10:37.911
I don't care for naturally curly hair.

01:10:38.119 --> 01:10:41.081
I like the artificial kind,
with the curlers in it.

01:10:41.289 --> 01:10:44.668
- What are you doin' in here?
- Just talkin' to the lady.

01:10:44.876 --> 01:10:46.920
Get the hell out.

01:10:50.006 --> 01:10:52.676
Get that thing back on your head.

01:11:13.822 --> 01:11:16.533
- What say, Frank?
- What's happening?

01:11:16.741 --> 01:11:20.412
Not much. What you makin' there, Scotch?

01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:22.414
Bourbon.

01:11:22.622 --> 01:11:26.960
This here's Gator McKlusky. He's gonna
be makin' some runs for Big Bear.

01:11:27.168 --> 01:11:31.798
McKlusky. I knew a McKlusky once
who lived in Oleander County.

01:11:32.007 --> 01:11:34.885
- Want another case Saturday?
- Yeah.

01:11:39.306 --> 01:11:45.729
Jim McKlusky. Made real still pot liquor,
not this lead radiator poison.

01:11:45.937 --> 01:11:49.649
Just sell it. Don't drink it, Frank.

01:11:49.858 --> 01:11:52.861
He looked a little bit like you.

01:11:53.069 --> 01:11:57.449
Jim McKlusky. He any kin to you?

01:11:57.657 --> 01:12:01.369
- What'd you say?
- Is he any kin to you?

01:12:01.578 --> 01:12:04.539
- My daddy.
- Well, I'll be go to hell.

01:12:04.748 --> 01:12:08.335
You Jim McKlusky's boy?
It's been a long time.

01:12:10.253 --> 01:12:14.841
Long time ago. 1952. When I was a kid,
he used to work in the shot house.

01:12:15.050 --> 01:12:18.136
Let's go. Ain't got time to shoot the breeze.

01:12:21.097 --> 01:12:24.726
When you see your daddy,
you tell him Frank Robley said hello.

01:12:24.935 --> 01:12:26.978
I'll tell him.

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:50.627
What you got in that book?

01:12:50.835 --> 01:12:52.879
You got the wrong idea.

01:12:53.088 --> 01:12:55.507
You better not keep
tryin' somethin' with Lou.

01:12:55.715 --> 01:12:57.968
- I ain't talkin' about Lou.
- I am.

01:12:58.176 --> 01:13:01.179
- You been writin' a love poem?
- You peanut head.

01:13:01.388 --> 01:13:04.266
You don't know your can
from second base.

01:13:04.474 --> 01:13:07.978
- I don't have to take that from nobody.
- You super giant ass!

01:13:08.186 --> 01:13:10.021
Damn you!

01:13:10.856 --> 01:13:13.942
Goddam it! Let go of me!

01:13:14.150 --> 01:13:16.194
You stupid...!

01:13:37.257 --> 01:13:38.884
Punk!

01:13:44.598 --> 01:13:46.224
Now, listen, you son of a...

01:13:46.433 --> 01:13:48.894
Goddam it!

01:13:49.102 --> 01:13:50.437
Shoot!

01:13:53.648 --> 01:13:55.692
- Hey.
- What?

01:13:58.486 --> 01:14:00.113
You damn peanut head.

01:14:00.322 --> 01:14:03.783
Don't tell me you wasn't
messin' around with Lou.

01:14:03.992 --> 01:14:09.539
I don't mind you foolin' around, but I can't
let you block the alley with this vehicle.

01:14:09.748 --> 01:14:12.542
I'm gonna have to give you a citation.

01:14:12.751 --> 01:14:15.337
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

01:14:31.686 --> 01:14:36.066
Hey, Skeeter.
Still tryin' to beat that machine?

01:14:36.274 --> 01:14:38.318
He ain't here.

01:14:40.195 --> 01:14:42.572
I didn't ask if anybody was here,
Mrs Watson.

01:14:42.781 --> 01:14:46.409
You was talkin' about Dude in town.
He ain't here. I ain't seen him.

01:14:46.618 --> 01:14:50.163
Howdy, Mrs Watson. What you doin'?
Makin' a banana puddin'?

01:14:54.751 --> 01:14:58.630
What I need to do, Skeeter,
is ask Dude a couple of questions.

01:14:58.838 --> 01:15:01.883
You heard her. He ain't here.

01:15:03.718 --> 01:15:05.762
Damn near had that 75 there.

01:15:05.971 --> 01:15:09.474
Now, you wouldn't wanna see Dude
get in any trouble.

01:15:09.683 --> 01:15:11.893
And I'm here to see he don't.

01:15:12.102 --> 01:15:18.733
Just can't beat one of these Sears
Roebuck pinball machines. No, siree.

01:15:18.942 --> 01:15:23.655
- You gotta hit the flippers.
- I hit the flippers all the time.

01:15:27.909 --> 01:15:30.370
Where is he, Mrs Watson?

01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:41.298
You know, don't you, Skeeter?

01:15:46.970 --> 01:15:50.056
I believe you got a loose hinge here.

01:15:51.516 --> 01:15:54.144
- Come here.
- You tryin' to tear my clothes off?

01:15:54.352 --> 01:15:55.770
Feel in there.

01:15:55.979 --> 01:15:58.857
Where is he? Where's he at?

01:15:59.065 --> 01:16:02.569
Harry... Harry Boon's place!

01:16:07.073 --> 01:16:09.534
Get some ice water for them fingers.

01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:20.754
JW! Boy, we got a load out here for ya!

01:16:21.546 --> 01:16:26.801
- JW!
- Roy? Is that you? Something's wrong.

01:16:27.010 --> 01:16:29.638
There's nobody around here.
Let's get the hell...

01:16:35.894 --> 01:16:37.938
Dude!

01:16:46.446 --> 01:16:49.074
Get your hands off of me!

01:16:56.414 --> 01:16:58.875
You can do better than that.

01:17:01.253 --> 01:17:03.296
Come on.

01:17:11.471 --> 01:17:13.515
Dammit!

01:17:18.270 --> 01:17:19.688
Attaway!

01:17:21.606 --> 01:17:23.650
Come back here!

01:17:33.201 --> 01:17:34.953
Damn you.

01:17:51.052 --> 01:17:57.058
Tan her hide, Freddie. Oughta be more
hide-tanning and less psychology.

01:17:57.267 --> 01:18:00.061
Junior, go tell J C Connors
to come on down here.

01:18:00.270 --> 01:18:03.190
Put the cuffs on him there. Elmer.

01:18:03.398 --> 01:18:06.401
You should have done your time
and stayed in that prison.

01:18:06.610 --> 01:18:12.240
It tees me off, federal sons of Yankees
comin' down here, stool-pigeonin'.

01:18:12.449 --> 01:18:16.244
- I'm sorry about what I done to you.
- Get your hands off me.

01:18:22.167 --> 01:18:25.670
You know how to put that stuff away,
don't you, boy?

01:18:28.715 --> 01:18:35.680
You know, when you first come up
to my place, I knowed you wasn't right.

01:18:35.889 --> 01:18:38.850
- I smelled it.
- Sheriff's on his way.

01:18:39.059 --> 01:18:41.937
Dagnabit!

01:18:42.145 --> 01:18:45.857
J C Connors'll come with that rowboat
now and some cement blocks.

01:18:46.066 --> 01:18:49.402
<i>We'll have to put this old boy away.</i>

01:18:49.611 --> 01:18:53.740
- Let's go upstairs.
- Get your damn hands off of me!

01:18:58.286 --> 01:19:02.958
Why, you ignorant, stupid jughead!
Can't you see she ain't willin'?

01:19:03.166 --> 01:19:06.503
Bring her back in here and sit her down.

01:19:09.005 --> 01:19:12.008
<i>Get your hands off!</i>

01:19:14.886 --> 01:19:17.889
I hope you rot and burn in hell!

01:19:29.818 --> 01:19:32.279
I know why you're doin' that.

01:19:35.824 --> 01:19:39.411
That's right. I'm gonna get
so goddam drunk,

01:19:39.619 --> 01:19:43.999
I ain't gonna know what's happenin'
when you take me out to drown me.

01:19:44.207 --> 01:19:47.919
You're gonna have more fun
than we are, ain't you?

01:19:48.128 --> 01:19:50.505
Bet your big butt I am.

01:19:50.714 --> 01:19:53.925
You know what? You're a good old boy.

01:19:54.134 --> 01:19:58.847
It's a cryin' shame you gotta be
a sneakin', lyin', behind-the-back,

01:19:59.055 --> 01:20:01.850
yellow, chicken, thievin' stool-pigeon!

01:20:03.810 --> 01:20:06.062
<i>Well, don't worry about it.</i>

01:20:06.271 --> 01:20:10.275
I'm gonna be so drunk,
I ain't gonna know the difference.

01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:16.907
- You know what?
- What?

01:20:17.115 --> 01:20:20.202
You know what she's got on her belly?

01:20:21.494 --> 01:20:23.538
What?

01:20:25.665 --> 01:20:27.500
Come here.

01:20:35.634 --> 01:20:38.845
- She's got a tattoo.
- Tattoo!

01:20:39.930 --> 01:20:41.640
What?

01:20:41.848 --> 01:20:46.728
What? I said she's got
a tattoo on her belly.

01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:51.233
Know what of?

01:20:54.069 --> 01:20:56.696
American flag.

01:20:56.905 --> 01:20:59.074
- You know what else?
- What?

01:20:59.282 --> 01:21:03.453
- Two eagles fightin' a snake.
- Malarkey!

01:21:03.662 --> 01:21:06.039
American flag!

01:21:06.248 --> 01:21:10.043
I've seen it. It's beautiful.

01:21:14.339 --> 01:21:17.300
Didn't Roy tell you about it?
You don't believe me, do you?

01:21:17.509 --> 01:21:19.511
No.

01:21:19.719 --> 01:21:23.014
- Why don't you go take a look?
- Shoot.

01:21:25.976 --> 01:21:28.019
All right, I will.

01:21:29.312 --> 01:21:31.356
Hey, come here.

01:21:33.567 --> 01:21:35.402
<i>No!</i>

01:21:38.154 --> 01:21:40.532
Dammit! Leave me alone!

01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:42.784
Leave me alone!

01:21:49.749 --> 01:21:52.294
Honey, the boys wanna
take a peek at a tattoo.

01:21:52.502 --> 01:21:54.588
It ain't gonna hurt nobody.

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:19.404
Come on!

01:22:38.924 --> 01:22:40.967
No, no. Come on.

01:23:31.309 --> 01:23:35.730
<i>Shove the devil away,
because the devil's tryin' to get you, too.</i>

01:23:35.939 --> 01:23:39.693
<i>He's workin' at you. He's workin' with you.
He's against you.</i>

01:23:39.901 --> 01:23:42.279
<i>But the Lord's on your side,</i>

01:23:42.487 --> 01:23:46.825
<i>so reach out your hand
and put your hand in his hand</i>

01:23:47.033 --> 01:23:49.077
<i>and don't let him go.</i>

01:23:53.832 --> 01:23:55.876
It pinches the saw.

01:23:59.629 --> 01:24:01.298
Hi.

01:24:01.506 --> 01:24:03.550
There.

01:24:05.719 --> 01:24:09.097
- Where in the hell am I?
- Are you feelin' any better now?

01:24:09.306 --> 01:24:11.808
This is Sister Linda Fay

01:24:12.017 --> 01:24:15.103
and over here is Annie Lou and Betty Jo,

01:24:15.312 --> 01:24:18.481
and Vicky, and I'm Vinnie Carruthers.

01:24:18.690 --> 01:24:23.486
You're just prattling.
Everybody out of here, right now.

01:24:24.654 --> 01:24:28.408
Go on. Out of here.
That takes care of the devil's harness.

01:24:28.617 --> 01:24:33.455
Come on, everybody.
Out of here right now. Shoo. Go on.

01:24:33.663 --> 01:24:37.834
Don't you go getting him excited.
He'll tear out all those stitches.

01:24:38.043 --> 01:24:40.795
Isn't she wonderful? Praise God!

01:24:41.004 --> 01:24:42.839
Where the hell am I?

01:24:43.048 --> 01:24:46.426
You're at Sister Linda Fay's
Home For Unwed Mothers.

01:24:46.635 --> 01:24:49.763
- No shit.
- Lou told us all about you.

01:24:49.971 --> 01:24:52.849
Lou here was one of our mothers.
Had a girl.

01:24:53.058 --> 01:24:56.937
What would you like for lunch?
Hominy or tapioca?

01:24:57.145 --> 01:24:59.523
Tapioca. All right.

01:24:59.731 --> 01:25:02.817
Bet that ain't as good as shaky puddin'.

01:25:03.693 --> 01:25:08.448
- Is your name McKlusky?
- Jenny, come and feed that baby.

01:25:08.657 --> 01:25:11.618
- OK.
- Carol Cray, you come up here, too.

01:25:11.826 --> 01:25:15.539
What... what happened to you?

01:25:18.166 --> 01:25:21.461
I was tryin' to save
these two buddies of mine from...

01:25:21.670 --> 01:25:24.673
...gettin' knocked up by a homosexual.

01:25:24.881 --> 01:25:26.550
Praise God.

01:26:02.836 --> 01:26:05.505
Here comes little Dude.

01:26:05.714 --> 01:26:09.217
- The other son of a bitch is loose.
- We'll get him.

01:26:09.426 --> 01:26:11.845
Couldn't believe it, Maggie.

01:26:12.053 --> 01:26:15.223
I swear to God, I just couldn't believe it.

01:26:15.432 --> 01:26:19.853
- Good old Dude.
- I told him. I warned him.

01:26:22.355 --> 01:26:24.399
Too much wooly booger, JC.

01:26:24.608 --> 01:26:27.235
You can't go at it every night, Bear.

01:26:27.444 --> 01:26:30.238
You know what?
We ain't been fishin' in a long time.

01:26:30.447 --> 01:26:33.116
Why don't we just take a day off
and go fishin'?

01:26:33.325 --> 01:26:39.873
Fishin'? Right now my boat
ain't rigged for fishin', Bear.

01:26:40.081 --> 01:26:43.335
Dude was a good old boy.

01:26:43.543 --> 01:26:47.297
He was just lucky the boys
didn't know what he was doin'.

01:26:47.505 --> 01:26:50.550
Listen, Maggie, you
and the little girl need anything,

01:26:50.759 --> 01:26:53.470
you just tell me, OK?

01:26:53.678 --> 01:26:57.098
Thanks, Roy. That wife of his in Memphis,

01:26:57.307 --> 01:27:00.018
she's going to get every cent
of that insurance money.

01:27:09.444 --> 01:27:13.198
- You seen that McKlusky fella?
- No, sir, JC. I still ain't seen him.

01:27:13.406 --> 01:27:18.787
- Well, you let me know if you do.
- Yes, sir. I sure will.

01:27:18.995 --> 01:27:22.249
Respects and condolences
to you, ma'am.

01:27:22.457 --> 01:27:24.793
You go to hell.

01:27:28.547 --> 01:27:30.924
How long ago was it you were in here?

01:27:31.132 --> 01:27:33.593
I don't wanna talk about it.

01:27:37.013 --> 01:27:39.057
Mornin'.

01:27:49.109 --> 01:27:51.152
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:27:52.445 --> 01:27:54.281
- It's a pretty baby.
- Thank you.

01:27:54.489 --> 01:27:56.575
- What's his name?
- Jimmy Lee.

01:27:56.783 --> 01:27:59.035
Lee's a lot better than Grant.

01:27:59.244 --> 01:28:02.914
Would you take the baby in?
I think he's gettin' a little hungry.

01:28:03.123 --> 01:28:07.961
- I sure will. Is his bottle on the stove?
- No, it's up in my room coolin'.

01:28:08.169 --> 01:28:11.256
You did say your name
was McKlusky, didn't you?

01:28:12.966 --> 01:28:15.385
Yeah. Why?

01:28:15.594 --> 01:28:18.054
You got a brother named Donny?

01:28:20.265 --> 01:28:23.393
- Did you know my brother?
- We was good friends.

01:28:23.602 --> 01:28:26.229
We went to school together
down in Auburn.

01:28:26.438 --> 01:28:29.774
- I saw it the night when it happened.
- You what?

01:28:29.983 --> 01:28:33.195
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
said anything about that.

01:28:35.238 --> 01:28:38.575
- Jesus Christ, you mean...
- I didn't see when he was killed.

01:28:38.783 --> 01:28:41.661
I was with him before.

01:28:41.870 --> 01:28:44.623
Some of us kids,
we come down from school afterwards.

01:28:44.831 --> 01:28:47.125
There was nothing we could do.

01:28:47.334 --> 01:28:50.879
Yeah, but why? Why'd it happen?

01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:57.219
- What... what did Donny do?
- Nothin'. I mean, nothin' bad.

01:28:57.427 --> 01:29:01.306
- We was all just protestin'.
- Protestin'?

01:29:02.516 --> 01:29:05.644
What the hell's he got to protest about
in Bogan County?

01:29:05.852 --> 01:29:08.021
You protest up north, up in New York.

01:29:08.230 --> 01:29:12.901
That's the beauty of it. Don't you see?
It was his idea.

01:29:13.109 --> 01:29:16.613
We take the worst county in the state
to hold the demonstration.

01:29:16.821 --> 01:29:19.950
- Why?
- You know how Donny was.

01:29:21.284 --> 01:29:22.869
No, I don't.

01:29:23.078 --> 01:29:25.997
Ten of us come up.
We had this here sit-in.

01:29:26.206 --> 01:29:30.085
We was goin' back to school in
the mornin', so we bought a six-pack.

01:29:30.293 --> 01:29:34.714
I guess we was makin' too much noise.
The manager called the sheriff.

01:29:34.923 --> 01:29:37.300
Pretty soon, there he was.

01:29:37.509 --> 01:29:42.514
Donny told him he couldn't do nothin'
'cause he didn't have a search warrant.

01:29:42.722 --> 01:29:46.184
The sheriff said he wasn't gonna have
a bunch of damn hippies

01:29:46.393 --> 01:29:50.605
stirrin' up folks with all their protestin'
and startin' anything in his county.

01:29:50.814 --> 01:29:53.775
And so Donny told him everybody knew

01:29:53.984 --> 01:29:57.654
he was nothin' but a fascist pig mother
stealin' the county blind.

01:29:57.863 --> 01:30:00.365
Then the sheriff hit him.

01:30:00.574 --> 01:30:05.662
Then the deputy grabbed Donny and
one of the other guys and took 'em away.

01:30:05.871 --> 01:30:10.417
Next thing we knew, he was dead.
That's it.

01:30:16.548 --> 01:30:18.592
You know somethin'?

01:30:20.468 --> 01:30:22.929
I just got out of prison.

01:30:25.849 --> 01:30:30.937
For runnin' cars, stealin' cars,
runnin' moonshine.

01:30:33.106 --> 01:30:35.150
I ain't never...

01:30:37.611 --> 01:30:41.156
I ain't never done nothin' good
in my whole life.

01:30:45.076 --> 01:30:48.997
And then along come Donny and...

01:30:51.708 --> 01:30:54.252
...he's the only one
that ever went to school.

01:30:54.461 --> 01:30:57.797
Only one that ever accomplished anything.

01:30:59.090 --> 01:31:02.177
Only one who ever did anything
in the whole family.

01:31:10.185 --> 01:31:13.355
What the hell does it mean?

01:31:14.981 --> 01:31:19.486
Mr McKlusky. Sheriff's out there
askin' about you.

01:31:35.669 --> 01:31:38.296
Gator.

01:32:11.162 --> 01:32:13.206
Let's go! Come on!

01:32:13.707 --> 01:32:17.002
Get in the car! Junior, let's go!

01:32:28.555 --> 01:32:34.352
All units. Got a man headin' down the
Jackson road towards Colton. Cut him off.

01:33:28.990 --> 01:33:30.450
Stay right on him.

01:34:09.197 --> 01:34:11.241
Take a right.

01:34:11.449 --> 01:34:14.953
- That's back to town.
- Take a right here.

01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:22.419
Get after him.

01:34:23.753 --> 01:34:25.797
Dammit!

01:34:49.988 --> 01:34:51.907
I'll get a shot at him here.

01:35:24.523 --> 01:35:28.235
Get over to the right a little bit, Junior.
Just get it to the right.

01:35:37.744 --> 01:35:41.957
Junior, if you lose this thing,
it's comin' out of your paycheck.

01:35:44.459 --> 01:35:47.420
Got to ease in the curve, Junior.

01:35:47.629 --> 01:35:51.550
- We're gettin' him.
- Now you're gettin' him.

01:36:15.824 --> 01:36:18.159
Where in the hell did he go?

01:36:18.368 --> 01:36:21.413
Well, get after him, Junior.

01:36:59.743 --> 01:37:05.081
I told you. I told you and I told you!
Damn hard-head!

01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:12.047
- You OK?
- You see me walking, don't you?

01:37:13.006 --> 01:37:15.842
Dammit. When I get my hands on him...!

01:39:44.407 --> 01:39:52.123
<i>Way down under
Way down under</i>

01:39:54.292 --> 01:40:00.840
<i>There's a place
where every man finds his brother</i>

01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:05.887
<i>Way down under</i>

01:40:06.805 --> 01:40:14.855

01:40:15.063 --> 01:40:19.192

01:40:19.401 --> 01:40:26.658
<i>Lord, it rings with the sound of thunder...</i>

01:40:27.993 --> 01:40:31.621
Damn. The good, they die young.

01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:38.795
<i>Way down under
Well, I wonder</i>

01:40:40.297 --> 01:40:47.179
