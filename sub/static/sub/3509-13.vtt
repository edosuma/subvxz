WEBVTT

00:00.335 --> 00:02.572
Previously on Castle...

00:03.335 --> 00:05.572
10 years, since we came home

00:05.606 --> 00:08.108
and found detective
Raglan waiting for us.

00:08.141 --> 00:11.328
It was my mother.
She had been stabbed.

00:11.362 --> 00:13.705
Three people were killed
the same way her mother was

00:13.706 --> 00:14.869
right about the same time.

00:14.870 --> 00:16.323
We believe we're dealing
with a professional.

00:16.324 --> 00:17.485
A contract killer?

00:17.486 --> 00:20.611
I caught him...
The man who killed my mom.

00:22.300 --> 00:23.883
Somebody paid him to do it.

00:23.884 --> 00:24.914
Who hired you to kill her?

00:24.915 --> 00:26.469
Forget it. You'll never touch 'em.

00:26.470 --> 00:27.726
But I had to shoot him...

00:29.063 --> 00:31.148
Before I could find out who.

00:34.000 --> 00:34.667
Someday soon,

00:34.685 --> 00:37.439
I'm gonna find who
had Coonan kill her.

00:37.952 --> 00:40.426
And I'd like you around when I do.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

01:18.045 --> 01:22.227
Mm.

01:24.080 --> 01:25.514
Beckett.

01:25.548 --> 01:26.915
Detective Beckett.

01:26.950 --> 01:28.684
Yeah.

01:28.718 --> 01:30.811
This is John Raglan.

01:30.812 --> 01:33.305
Uh... I was the lead investigator

01:33.340 --> 01:36.014
on your mother's
homicide 12 years ago.

01:37.520 --> 01:40.195
I remember you, detective Raglan.

01:40.542 --> 01:43.838
Listen, I...

01:45.315 --> 01:49.018
We need to talk about
your mother's case.

01:49.053 --> 01:51.087
There's something you don't know.

01:51.121 --> 01:53.256
There's a coffee
shop at 4th and Main.

01:53.290 --> 01:55.191
Meet me there in an hour.

01:55.225 --> 01:58.347
Just you. No cops.

02:07.386 --> 02:08.471
Beckett.

02:08.489 --> 02:09.020
Hey.

02:09.021 --> 02:11.874
Come on in.

02:13.737 --> 02:16.603
Can we talk for a second?

02:21.350 --> 02:23.300
That's him.

02:29.758 --> 02:32.727
Lady, what part of "no cops"
didn't you understand?

02:32.761 --> 02:35.256
- He's not a cop.
- Well, who the hell is he, then?

02:35.257 --> 02:37.231
He's someone I trust.

02:39.501 --> 02:41.753
More coffee?

02:41.787 --> 02:44.005
Thank you.

02:47.409 --> 02:50.814
Tell me what I don't know
about my mom's murder.

02:52.287 --> 02:53.911
Everybody drinks their coffee

02:53.912 --> 02:56.758
outta cardboard cups these days

02:56.800 --> 02:58.664
or those plastic travel mugs.

02:58.665 --> 03:00.019
But there's...

03:00.020 --> 03:01.196
There's something about the way

03:01.197 --> 03:03.974
ceramic warms your hands that...

03:05.712 --> 03:07.463
It's weird...

03:07.906 --> 03:10.408
The things you notice.

03:12.611 --> 03:15.846
I just got the long
face from the doc.

03:15.847 --> 03:17.991
Lymphoma.

03:17.992 --> 03:19.649
Six months.

03:19.650 --> 03:22.056
Sorry to hear about that.

03:24.966 --> 03:26.190
Every year around the holidays,

03:26.224 --> 03:28.325
they... they run that
"Christmas Carol"

03:28.360 --> 03:29.500
on local TV.

03:29.501 --> 03:31.578
When I was a kid,

03:31.579 --> 03:34.632
I remember, Jacob Marley
scared the hell out of me,

03:34.666 --> 03:38.269
forced to drag that... that chain
around in the next world.

03:38.270 --> 03:40.816
"I wear the chain
I forged in life."

03:40.817 --> 03:44.455
"I made it link by link."

03:46.677 --> 03:50.669
I hid a lot of sins
behind my badge.

03:50.700 --> 03:53.577
And now I gotta carry 'em.

03:53.578 --> 03:55.660
But your mother's case...

03:55.661 --> 03:57.231
That one weighs a ton.

03:57.232 --> 03:59.345
Why? Because you wrote it off

03:59.346 --> 04:02.453
as random gang violence
when you knew it wasn't?

04:02.454 --> 04:04.204
I did what I was told.
Yeah.

04:04.272 --> 04:05.973
And I kept quiet

04:06.007 --> 04:08.442
because I was afraid.

04:09.558 --> 04:10.542
About a year ago,

04:10.543 --> 04:12.607
there was a hostage
standoff in your precinct.

04:12.608 --> 04:15.223
You killed a hit man
named Dick Coonan.

04:15.224 --> 04:17.950
It was a big deal in the papers.

04:17.959 --> 04:19.660
People noticed.

04:19.695 --> 04:22.230
Who hired Coonan to kill my mom?

04:22.264 --> 04:23.865
You need some context here.

04:23.899 --> 04:26.211
This thing started
about 19 years ago,

04:26.212 --> 04:29.737
back before I ever knew
who Johanna Beckett was.

04:30.300 --> 04:33.641
19 years ago, I...

04:34.394 --> 04:37.234
I made a bad mistake.

04:37.334 --> 04:40.100
And that started the
dominoes falling.

04:40.494 --> 04:42.632
And one of 'em was your mom...

04:43.735 --> 04:47.000
Everybody, on the ground. Now!

04:49.364 --> 04:51.699
Back away from the window!
Away from the window!

04:51.700 --> 04:53.880
You're hit.
I'm fine. It's not my blood.

04:56.800 --> 05:00.136
1 Lincoln 40, I have shots
fired on 4th and Main.

05:00.170 --> 05:02.221
I need backup and an ambulance.

05:02.256 --> 05:04.607
1 Lincoln 40, repeat
your last transmission.

05:04.641 --> 05:07.577
You were broken.
1 Lincoln 40, repeat. Castle?

05:07.578 --> 05:11.380
Dispatch to 1 Lincoln 40, repeat.

05:11.415 --> 05:15.706
Dispatch to 1 Lincoln 40.
1 Lincoln 40, are you there?

05:16.214 --> 05:18.553
1 Lincoln 40...

05:18.554 --> 05:22.238
Please be advised,
this is now a homicide.

05:44.007 --> 05:45.792
Retired NYPD cop gunned down

05:45.793 --> 05:47.002
in front of one of my people,

05:47.003 --> 05:47.882
which means I'm gonna have to

05:47.883 --> 05:49.609
do a damn press conference.

05:49.610 --> 05:52.000
Tell me you didn't come
down here without backup.

05:52.083 --> 05:54.349
Sir, I...
We were backing her, captain.

05:54.350 --> 05:57.245
Yeah, we were just,
uh, down the block.

05:57.246 --> 06:00.365
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

06:01.458 --> 06:03.424
What the hell am I
gonna do with you?

06:03.499 --> 06:05.456
You're gonna let
me work this case.

06:05.457 --> 06:07.428
You're too close to it.
It's all over your face.

06:07.429 --> 06:08.264
You're thinking, what was

06:08.265 --> 06:10.137
Raglan gonna tell
me before he died,

06:10.138 --> 06:11.021
when you should be thinking

06:11.022 --> 06:12.415
how you're gonna catch
the guy that killed him.

06:12.416 --> 06:14.657
Sir, Raglan was killed
because he was gonna

06:14.658 --> 06:16.854
tell me something about
my mother's case.

06:16.855 --> 06:19.975
Nobody knows it better than I do.
Yeah, but I know you.

06:19.976 --> 06:21.170
You're gonna want to
pick up those scissors

06:21.171 --> 06:22.964
and run around the house with 'em,

06:22.965 --> 06:25.359
but I'm telling you now,
walk, don't run.

06:25.360 --> 06:28.677
Go where the evidence leads,
not the other way around.

06:29.482 --> 06:30.625
Do you read me?

06:30.626 --> 06:34.833
Yes, sir. Loud and clear.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.821
Found a bullet
embedded in the booth.

06:39.822 --> 06:42.518
.338 Magnum. Fairly exotic
antipersonnel round.

06:42.519 --> 06:43.951
Can you show me the trajectory?

06:43.952 --> 06:46.891
Yeah, it's right over here.

06:55.200 --> 06:58.686
All right, I make the building
across the street, fourth floor.

06:58.720 --> 07:00.688
Esposito. 
Yeah, I'll lock it down.

07:00.722 --> 07:02.857
Somebody had to have seen something in there.
Yeah.

07:02.891 --> 07:05.860
Ryan, I am betting that Raglan's
murderer followed him here.

07:05.894 --> 07:06.949
Can you check with his neighbors,

07:06.950 --> 07:09.327
see if anyone was hanging
around his place this morning?

07:09.328 --> 07:11.999
You got it.
Thanks.

07:14.002 --> 07:15.136
Hey.

07:15.170 --> 07:16.520
Hey. You good?

07:16.521 --> 07:19.474
Yeah. I think I got
it all off my hands.

07:19.508 --> 07:22.319
It's different when it happens
right in front of you.

07:23.161 --> 07:25.953
You're close enough to
watch the lights go out.

07:26.815 --> 07:28.842
Yeah.

07:28.843 --> 07:30.384
When I saw the blood
on your shirt,

07:30.419 --> 07:32.476
I thought you'd been shot.

07:37.646 --> 07:39.944
Um, I'm gonna go to the 12th.

07:40.266 --> 07:42.071
How about I drop you
off at your place?

07:42.072 --> 07:44.347
Not a chance.

07:45.850 --> 07:47.250
Okay.

07:55.342 --> 07:57.864
Yo. So I checked out
the fourth floor.

07:57.865 --> 07:59.881
There's no prints,
no casings, no witnesses,

07:59.882 --> 08:02.065
but the good news is,
it's a secure building.

08:02.099 --> 08:04.349
The only way in or out is
through the lobby, and nobody

08:04.350 --> 08:05.446
gets through the lobby turnstiles

08:05.447 --> 08:07.704
without a key card.
So our shooter had a card.

08:07.738 --> 08:09.873
Yeah, they're sending over a
list of all their employees.

08:09.907 --> 08:11.858
They're also downloading
surveillance video

08:11.909 --> 08:13.359
from the lobby. 
Hey.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.232
So I, uh, talked to the neighbors.

08:15.233 --> 08:18.265
Raglan was a widower.
No next of kin that I could find.

08:18.266 --> 08:20.984
Super said he didn't
really even have visitors,

08:21.018 --> 08:22.845
except every once in a while,
his buddy would come over

08:22.846 --> 08:24.406
to watch a Yankee game.

08:24.407 --> 08:27.708
Gary McCallister...
Raglan's old academy classmate.

08:27.709 --> 08:29.092
Get ahold of McCallister.

08:29.126 --> 08:30.749
See if he'll come.
I want to talk to him.

08:30.750 --> 08:32.374
You got it.

08:34.162 --> 08:36.065
19 years ago.

08:36.066 --> 08:38.835
What's that? 
Raglan started telling us about something

08:38.869 --> 08:40.433
that happened 19 years ago.

08:40.433 --> 08:42.094
My mom's murder was 12 years ago.

08:42.095 --> 08:44.375
It's not making any sense.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.393
You know, I sacrificed
my best years

08:47.444 --> 08:49.946
and worst marriages
to this damn city.

08:50.808 --> 08:53.169
You'd think that'd be enough,
but it never is.

08:53.851 --> 08:56.498
Had to gobble up my
best friend, too.

08:56.499 --> 08:59.405
When was the last time
you saw John Raglan?

08:59.456 --> 09:01.558
Week ago. Told me he was dying.

09:01.592 --> 09:03.526
What else did he tell you?

09:04.104 --> 09:06.859
Isn't that enough?

09:06.860 --> 09:08.221
But I don't get it.

09:08.222 --> 09:10.653
Raglan was retired by the
time you come on the job.

09:10.654 --> 09:11.652
What'd he want with you?

09:11.653 --> 09:14.771
Raglan was helping
me with a-a cold case

09:14.805 --> 09:16.272
that I was working on.

09:16.307 --> 09:18.621
I believe he was killed
to keep him quiet.

09:18.622 --> 09:20.476
Look, Raglan seemed
to think that the case

09:20.511 --> 09:23.847
had something to do with
something he did 19 years ago.

09:23.848 --> 09:25.718
What was he into back then?

09:25.719 --> 09:27.083
What was he into?

09:27.117 --> 09:29.969
John Raglan was no angel,

09:29.970 --> 09:32.317
and New York was a
different city back then,

09:32.318 --> 09:33.056
and I'm here to tell you,

09:33.090 --> 09:35.525
kid gloves didn't get
it done out there.

09:35.559 --> 09:37.443
You police a damn theme park.

09:37.494 --> 09:40.163
You're lookin' to start some
half-assed truth commission,

09:40.197 --> 09:41.166
you can count me out.

09:41.167 --> 09:43.722
I'm not trying to
tarnish Raglan's memory.

09:43.723 --> 09:47.190
I'm trying to find his murderer.

09:51.099 --> 09:53.909
I told him not to get
involved with that guy.

09:53.910 --> 09:56.195
With who? 
Vulcan Simmons.

09:56.229 --> 09:59.340
Vulcan Simmons? 
He runs half the drug trade in New York.

09:59.341 --> 10:01.364
Raglan liked to play the ponies.

10:01.365 --> 10:03.719
19, 20 years ago would
be about the time

10:03.753 --> 10:06.765
he had a string of bad luck

10:06.766 --> 10:07.523
and he was hard up for money.

10:07.557 --> 10:09.725
And then he wasn't.

10:09.759 --> 10:12.070
And then he wasn't.

10:12.071 --> 10:13.342
Word was, he got well

10:13.343 --> 10:16.062
working as a dope
courier for Simmons,

10:16.063 --> 10:19.604
moving product across
town in his patrol car.

10:19.605 --> 10:22.027
Raglan worked Homicide
for four years.

10:22.028 --> 10:24.821
And I know Simmons put
people in the ground.

10:25.728 --> 10:27.362
If it were my case,

10:27.363 --> 10:30.071
I'd take a hard look
at Vulcan Simmons.

10:30.072 --> 10:32.345
Assault, attempted murder,
extortion,

10:32.346 --> 10:35.369
possession with intent,
witness intimidation...

10:37.000 --> 10:38.634
Then it looks like
it just dries up.

10:38.635 --> 10:40.059
Nobody's booked him in years.

10:40.060 --> 10:42.055
So what does that mean,
he found religion?

10:42.056 --> 10:44.220
It means he got smart.
Swimming in deeper waters.

10:44.221 --> 10:46.411
Guess he's come a long way
since Washington Heights.

10:46.412 --> 10:49.338
Wait. What? You said Washington Heights?
Back in the day,

10:49.339 --> 10:51.814
Simmons used to run the drug
trade in Washington Heights.

10:55.100 --> 10:58.002
My mom and a group
of her colleagues,

10:58.036 --> 10:59.323
they put together this campaign

10:59.324 --> 11:00.852
called Take Back the Neighborhood.

11:00.853 --> 11:02.953
They were trying to get
drug dealers off the streets

11:02.954 --> 11:04.468
in Washington Heights.

11:04.469 --> 11:06.613
With Simmons running all the
dope in that neighborhood,

11:06.614 --> 11:08.118
that campaign woulda cost him.

11:08.119 --> 11:10.339
That hit man, Coonan,
we know that he was into dope.

11:10.340 --> 11:12.253
Maybe that's how Simmons
got in contact with him.

11:12.254 --> 11:14.399
So Simmons hires Coonan
to kill them all,

11:14.400 --> 11:17.095
including your mother,
and pays his old friend Raglan

11:17.096 --> 11:19.753
to write off their homicides
as random gang violence.

11:19.754 --> 11:20.457
There would've been
no way to trace

11:20.458 --> 11:21.545
the murders back to him.

11:21.546 --> 11:24.459
Until Raglan threatens to reveal
his role in the conspiracy,

11:24.460 --> 11:26.150
and Simmons has him silenced.

11:26.151 --> 11:28.001
We'll have him in the
box before lunch.

11:30.776 --> 11:33.578
You painted since the
last time I was here.

11:33.579 --> 11:36.496
Hmm. You'd have been about 16,

11:36.497 --> 11:37.943
wrestling some pimply kid

11:37.944 --> 11:39.564
in the back of his daddy's wagon,

11:39.565 --> 11:41.830
wondering if you were gonna
give it to him or not.

11:41.831 --> 11:44.202
Hey. That's enough.

11:44.203 --> 11:48.339
He's sweet on you. 
Makes him brave.

11:48.340 --> 11:51.048
What was your association
with detective John Raglan?

11:51.049 --> 11:53.826
Raglan? 
Raglan, Raglan, Raglan?

11:53.827 --> 11:55.311
Thirsty cop, right?

11:55.312 --> 11:58.147
Couldn't pick a winner
to save his life?

11:58.181 --> 12:00.208
Well, detective, our association,

12:00.209 --> 12:00.763
as you put it,

12:00.764 --> 12:04.325
exceeded the statute of
limitations many moons ago.

12:04.326 --> 12:08.107
There is no statute of
limitations on murder,

12:08.108 --> 12:08.791
Mr. Simmons.

12:08.792 --> 12:12.356
And here begins what is known
as the initial confrontation.

12:12.357 --> 12:14.022
During this phase of
the interrogation,

12:14.023 --> 12:16.331
the interrogator may invade
the suspect's personal space

12:16.332 --> 12:18.226
in order to increase
his discomfort.

12:18.227 --> 12:20.003
You want to invade
my personal space?

12:20.004 --> 12:23.229
Look at me.

12:26.770 --> 12:28.926
12 years ago, Johanna Beckett led

12:28.927 --> 12:30.809
a big take back the
neighborhood campaign

12:30.810 --> 12:33.610
in Washington Heights. And
that must have pissed you off.

12:33.645 --> 12:35.846
And this would be
theme development.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.182
Presenting the crime through
the eyes of the suspect.

12:38.216 --> 12:40.317
Johanna Beckett was murdered

12:40.351 --> 12:42.252
along with two of her colleagues.

12:42.287 --> 12:45.518
They were professional hits
carried out on your orders.

12:45.519 --> 12:46.340
And you had

12:46.341 --> 12:49.894
your pet homicide detective
John Raglan bury them.

12:55.404 --> 12:57.576
Look at her face.

12:57.577 --> 13:01.247
Tell me you don't remember her.

13:01.248 --> 13:04.049
You know, detective Beckett...

13:05.300 --> 13:08.535
I think I do remember her.

13:08.570 --> 13:13.428
Bled out in an alley
like the trash she was.

13:13.429 --> 13:15.035
Mr. Simmons, you better watch it.

13:15.036 --> 13:19.246
Rich bitch from Uptown
on safari in the Heights.

13:20.185 --> 13:22.182
Somebody shoulda warned her

13:22.217 --> 13:25.594
not to feed or tease the animals.

13:25.595 --> 13:26.487
You...

13:26.521 --> 13:29.690
If they had, she might
not have gotten eaten.

13:29.724 --> 13:31.658
From what I hear, though...

13:31.676 --> 13:33.794
She was pretty tasty. 
Oh!

13:33.828 --> 13:36.146
Whoa, Beckett!

13:36.943 --> 13:38.115
Back off, Castle!

13:38.149 --> 13:41.487
Remember your old life, Vulcan.
Savor it.

13:41.488 --> 13:44.487
Because I am gonna
take it all away.

13:44.488 --> 13:46.216
Stand down.
Beckett, that's enough.

13:46.217 --> 13:48.375
Stand down. 
Oh.

13:51.012 --> 13:52.963
Oh, you want some, too?
Come on.

13:53.014 --> 13:55.649
All right, all right,
that's enough!

13:55.683 --> 13:57.466
I have to kick that son
of a bitch loose now.

13:57.467 --> 13:59.422
You realize that? 
Sir, you heard him.

13:59.423 --> 14:01.453
He as much as confessed
to the murder.

14:01.454 --> 14:03.348
Come on. He's playing you.
And you let him

14:03.349 --> 14:05.657
get under your skin,
acting like a damn rookie.

14:05.658 --> 14:07.077
We've got nothing to tie
him to Raglan's murder

14:07.111 --> 14:10.056
or your mother's.
You're off this case.

14:12.576 --> 14:14.683
No, sir. You can't do that.
Not now.

14:14.684 --> 14:15.662
I just did. 
No.

14:15.663 --> 14:18.563
I just did! 
Now you go home.

14:27.482 --> 14:29.846
Beckett?

14:30.311 --> 14:32.494
Kate? 
You, too, Castle. Clear out.

14:32.495 --> 14:35.765
What did I do?
I don't need you playing Nancy Drew on this.

14:36.050 --> 14:37.028
As of this moment,

14:37.029 --> 14:39.651
you two are running point
on Raglan's homicide.

14:40.632 --> 14:41.948
Uh, captain, m...

14:41.949 --> 14:43.960
My partner and I don't
wish to be insubordinate...

14:43.961 --> 14:46.100
But we respectfully
decline the assignment.

14:46.101 --> 14:47.961
What does it say on my badge?

14:47.962 --> 14:49.886
"Captain."
Now read the fine print.

14:49.887 --> 14:52.214
It says get your ass out there
and solve Raglan's murder

14:52.248 --> 14:53.817
before I bust you both
back down to traffic.

14:53.818 --> 14:55.483
Yes, sir. 
Yes, sir.

14:55.484 --> 14:56.777
You want to help her?
Find that shooter.

14:56.778 --> 14:58.904
Solve the damn case.

15:10.379 --> 15:12.730
What if it had been you?

15:14.516 --> 15:16.434
I didn't know you were home.

15:16.468 --> 15:18.598
I heard about the
shooting on the news.

15:18.599 --> 15:22.073
It could've been you.
You know that, don't you?

15:22.107 --> 15:23.826
Yeah, but I'm fine. 
It wasn't me.

15:23.827 --> 15:25.877
Richard, this isn't
one of your books.

15:25.911 --> 15:27.862
You don't know the ending.

15:27.896 --> 15:29.666
You were just lucky yesterday.

15:29.667 --> 15:33.564
You're overreacting, mother.
Where is this coming from?

15:33.565 --> 15:36.912
How the hell can you ask
me something like that?

15:38.039 --> 15:39.659
Think about how much
you love Alexis,

15:39.660 --> 15:41.242
and that is how much I love you.

15:41.276 --> 15:45.113
And don't you dare ask me
where this is coming from.

15:47.923 --> 15:48.816
You have gotten through
most of your life

15:48.850 --> 15:53.484
on your wit and charm and
no small amount of talent.

15:53.485 --> 15:55.748
But that is the real
world out there,

15:55.749 --> 15:59.049
and you can't charm your
way out of a bullet.

16:01.318 --> 16:04.190
You think I should quit?

16:04.191 --> 16:05.553
I think you should be
honest with yourself

16:05.554 --> 16:07.733
about why you're doing this.

16:08.327 --> 16:11.408
You have written 22
novels before you met her,

16:11.409 --> 16:14.825
and you didn't need to spend
every day in a police station

16:14.826 --> 16:16.347
in order to finish them.

16:17.962 --> 16:20.024
It's not about the books anymore.

16:23.853 --> 16:25.921
So you think that Simmons
hired the sniper?

16:25.956 --> 16:28.023
If we find the sniper,
we can ask him.

16:28.058 --> 16:30.827
- I figure, he had to disassemble
his rifle, right? - Yeah.

16:30.828 --> 16:32.774
Break his weapon down to
a less conspicuous shape

16:32.775 --> 16:34.541
in order to get it
through the lobby.

16:34.542 --> 16:35.906
Something that would fit
inside of a briefcase.

16:35.907 --> 16:38.062
Everyone in that lobby's
carrying a damn briefcase.

16:38.063 --> 16:39.455
You should be a detective.

16:42.725 --> 16:44.695
We can't come up
empty on this one.

16:44.696 --> 16:46.347
I know, bro.

16:47.911 --> 16:50.245
Whoa. That wasn't an accident.

16:52.234 --> 16:53.549
He just lifted her key card.

16:53.583 --> 16:55.127
Well, so much for
the card telling us

16:55.128 --> 16:56.860
who the sniper was. 
Wait a minute.

16:57.372 --> 16:58.389
He's not wearing gloves.

16:58.390 --> 16:59.917
So what? He didn't touch
any printable surfaces.

16:59.918 --> 17:01.076
Yeah, but he touched her.

17:01.077 --> 17:02.782
We can print a dead body, right?

17:02.783 --> 17:03.974
So why can't we print a live one?

17:03.975 --> 17:05.170
She's probably showered by now.

17:05.171 --> 17:07.396
Not necessarily. It's Saturday.
And it's barely afternoon.

17:07.396 --> 17:09.832
Come on.

17:21.205 --> 17:22.536
Hey, Castle.

17:22.808 --> 17:24.089
Hey.

17:25.154 --> 17:26.387
Where's Josh?

17:26.387 --> 17:29.018
Oh, he's in Africa.
He's saving the world.

17:30.222 --> 17:33.321
Uh, I brought you some...

17:33.322 --> 17:35.208
I just thought,
after everything, that...

17:35.209 --> 17:37.365
You might wanna...

17:37.583 --> 17:39.473
Here.

17:41.248 --> 17:43.131
Thank you.

17:43.132 --> 17:44.494
That's really sweet.

17:45.009 --> 17:47.525
You wanna come in?
Sure.

17:52.356 --> 17:55.364
Wow. Nice.

17:57.917 --> 18:00.353
You know, I was thinking
on the way over here,

18:00.354 --> 18:02.670
all the best cops... 
Dirty Harry,

18:02.671 --> 18:04.904
Cobra, the guy from
"Police Academy"

18:04.905 --> 18:06.203
who makes the helicopter noises...

18:06.204 --> 18:08.852
They all have one thing in common.
Plucky sidekick?

18:08.853 --> 18:11.573
That, and they do
their very best work

18:11.574 --> 18:13.399
after they've been
booted off a case.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.706
Is that what you came all the
way over here to tell me?

18:15.707 --> 18:19.334
Montgomery booted us
off the Raglan murder.

18:19.335 --> 18:21.640
But he didn't say anything
about your mother's case,

18:21.641 --> 18:22.987
did he?

18:22.988 --> 18:26.712
Here's my plan... I sneak back
into the station wearing a hat.

18:26.713 --> 18:28.071
Montgomery always
takes a coffee break

18:28.072 --> 18:29.664
15 minutes after the hour.

18:29.665 --> 18:31.378
I get your mother's
file wearing soft shoes.

18:31.379 --> 18:35.649
The south entrance has... 
What?

18:35.650 --> 18:37.998
Come on, Castle.
I gotta show you something.

18:45.222 --> 18:46.178
You know, I sometimes forget

18:46.179 --> 18:48.982
that you live with this every day.

18:50.698 --> 18:52.328
Josh know about this?

18:53.006 --> 18:55.308
No.

18:56.356 --> 18:58.187
When did you start?

18:58.287 --> 19:01.496
Over the summer,
when you were in the Hamptons.

19:03.824 --> 19:06.572
And how far have you gotten? 
Well, aside from my mom,

19:06.573 --> 19:09.303
there was also Diane Cavanaugh,
Jennifer Stewart.

19:09.304 --> 19:10.838
They volunteered for
her from time to time

19:10.839 --> 19:12.219
for the justice initiative.

19:12.220 --> 19:14.174
And then the fourth
victim was Scott Murray.

19:14.175 --> 19:16.789
He was a document clerk
at the courthouse.

19:16.790 --> 19:19.507
You know, Castle, up until today,
I'd always run this

19:19.508 --> 19:21.768
on the theory that they got
killed because of a legal case

19:21.769 --> 19:23.551
that they were working on.

19:23.748 --> 19:28.046
My mom requested a court file
just before she was murdered,

19:28.047 --> 19:29.164
and that file went missing.

19:29.165 --> 19:32.127
Well, your mom must have
had personal papers,

19:32.128 --> 19:34.128
an appointment book,
something that could tell you

19:34.129 --> 19:36.209
what she was working
on before she died.

19:36.210 --> 19:38.973
Oh, I went through all of that
nine years ago. There's nothing.

19:38.974 --> 19:41.101
Yeah, but a lot's
happened since then.

19:42.506 --> 19:45.125
Maybe you missed something.

19:45.126 --> 19:47.203
So the guy who touched
my arm was a murderer?

19:47.204 --> 19:50.253
Figures. Why do I
attract all the creeps?

19:50.254 --> 19:51.098
I dated this one guy, Craig,

19:51.099 --> 19:52.807
for like two months,
and I thought,

19:52.808 --> 19:55.465
like, he was the one.
And I called him up one night,

19:55.466 --> 19:56.854
and his roommate answered
the phone and told me

19:56.855 --> 19:59.054
that Craig had died,
and I was, like, devastated.

19:59.055 --> 20:00.868
And me and the roommate,
we scattered his ashes

20:00.869 --> 20:02.327
throughout Central Park...
the whole thing.

20:02.328 --> 20:05.085
And I worked through the stages
of grief with my life coach

20:05.086 --> 20:07.541
and a lot of random guys,
and I was getting into acceptance

20:07.542 --> 20:09.401
when I ran into Craig at a bar.

20:09.402 --> 20:11.860
He had faked his own death.
Unbelievable.

20:11.861 --> 20:14.032
I know, right? All he had to
do was say he didn't want us

20:14.033 --> 20:17.375
to date anymore. I mean,
it's not like I'm some psycho.

20:17.376 --> 20:19.808
Looks like we got a lift.
Thank you.

20:19.809 --> 20:23.778
Oh. Well, good thing
I slept in late, huh?

20:25.275 --> 20:27.603
There's nothing in
her appointment book.

20:27.604 --> 20:30.203
Not that I can make
sense of anyway.

20:30.204 --> 20:31.470
She had her own system.

20:31.471 --> 20:33.972
I mean, my dad and I could
never figure it out.

20:35.356 --> 20:37.009
Aww. You were adorable.

20:37.010 --> 20:38.541
Did your mom take these?

20:38.542 --> 20:41.873
Yeah, about three
weeks before she died.

20:46.842 --> 20:48.500
Oh, I don't get to
see you in action?

20:48.501 --> 20:51.090
Trust me, Castle.
It was not pretty.

20:51.091 --> 20:52.632
Oh, now I have to see it.

21:00.183 --> 21:01.118
Hmm.

21:01.956 --> 21:02.852
What?

21:03.696 --> 21:04.593
Uh...

21:04.901 --> 21:06.338
There's 24 exposures on this role,

21:06.339 --> 21:08.814
but there's only 20 pictures.

21:13.820 --> 21:14.673
What is it?

21:14.843 --> 21:16.512
I don't know. An empty street?

21:26.223 --> 21:28.518
Castle, this is where
my mom was murdered.

21:32.509 --> 21:33.071
I don't understand.

21:33.072 --> 21:34.796
I mean, these pictures
were developed

21:34.797 --> 21:36.239
a week before she was killed.

21:36.240 --> 21:38.569
Why would she be taking
photos of that alley?

21:38.570 --> 21:39.833
I don't know. 
I always thought

21:39.834 --> 21:42.149
it was just a convenient place
for the killer to attack.

21:42.150 --> 21:44.477
I mean, it was dark,
it was secluded.

21:44.478 --> 21:46.421
What if there was
more to it than that?

21:46.967 --> 21:47.965
What if she was
looking into something

21:47.966 --> 21:50.455
that happened in that alley
when they killed her?

21:50.778 --> 21:52.699
Well, I'd have to go into the
old archives and reports,

21:52.700 --> 21:53.872
and captain Montgomery
won't let me

21:53.873 --> 21:55.599
back into the precinct right now.

21:55.639 --> 21:56.611
I'll go.

22:03.573 --> 22:04.668
Hal Lockwood.

22:04.669 --> 22:06.523
Male, white, 32.

22:06.524 --> 22:08.079
Record's clean.

22:08.508 --> 22:11.610
According to this, Lockwood's never
had so much as a traffic citation.

22:11.611 --> 22:13.721
Credit history only goes
back about two years.

22:13.722 --> 22:15.548
Well, it's gotta be a cover I.D.

22:15.938 --> 22:17.988
Huh. His credit card's active.

22:17.989 --> 22:20.025
It shows Lockwood's
checked into a corporate suite

22:20.026 --> 22:21.528
in Midtown right now.

22:23.796 --> 22:24.734
NYPD! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

22:24.735 --> 22:26.290
NYPD clear!

22:26.681 --> 22:27.574
Clear.

22:28.328 --> 22:29.225
Clear.

22:35.595 --> 22:36.871
Looks like we just missed him.

22:36.872 --> 22:38.972
Yo. Look at this.

22:41.251 --> 22:42.611
He's been watching her.

22:51.782 --> 22:53.616
Ryan and Esposito
traced your sniper

22:53.617 --> 22:55.291
to a corporate suite in Midtown.

22:56.106 --> 22:58.130
He's been on you since
Raglan's murder.

22:58.319 --> 23:00.252
This isn't just a
kook with a deer rifle

23:00.253 --> 23:02.129
and a copy of
"Catcher in the Rye."

23:02.478 --> 23:05.353
This guy is a professional...
highly trained and well-funded.

23:05.354 --> 23:07.787
Maybe part of a team.
Sir, we gotta let Castle know.

23:07.788 --> 23:09.189
He does. He's back at the 12th.

23:09.190 --> 23:12.100
I caught him in the men's room,
poking through some old reports.

23:13.188 --> 23:16.488
You want to tell me about that?
You really want to know?

23:17.899 --> 23:19.725
Listen, I'm gonna have
to put a detail on you.

23:20.078 --> 23:21.194
But I need you to stay home.

23:21.195 --> 23:22.828
If this sniper is after me,

23:22.829 --> 23:24.927
the safest place in
the city is the 12th.

23:24.928 --> 23:27.302
You gotta let me have this, Roy.

23:27.381 --> 23:29.540
Let me come back and
work on my mom's case.

23:29.541 --> 23:31.524
No, I'm sorry.

23:31.952 --> 23:33.493
Absolutely not.

23:35.977 --> 23:38.662
C.S.U. analyzed the capsules
we found in Lockwood's suite

23:38.663 --> 23:41.194
and found they contain a
highly concentrated form

23:41.195 --> 23:44.485
of an antianxiety
drug called Prazepam.

23:45.226 --> 23:46.197
That fits.

23:46.545 --> 23:48.503
A good sniper fires
between heartbeats.

23:48.504 --> 23:49.954
Back in Special Forces,
some of the guys

23:49.955 --> 23:52.506
would use antianxiety meds to
slow down their heart rate.

23:52.507 --> 23:53.514
Gives 'em more time to shoot.

23:53.515 --> 23:55.545
But these didn't come
from any commercial lab.

23:55.546 --> 23:57.271
They were hand-ground by
someone on the street,

23:57.272 --> 24:00.533
someone very good with chemicals.
Someone like Vulcan Simmons.

24:00.534 --> 24:02.478
I thought the same thing,
but check this out.

24:03.631 --> 24:05.131
Dealers sometimes use
symbols like these

24:05.132 --> 24:07.013
to mark their product.

24:07.014 --> 24:08.948
These symbols don't
belong to Simmons.

24:09.066 --> 24:10.947
They're the brand of a
street pharmacist in Soho

24:10.948 --> 24:12.487
named Chad Rodrick.

24:12.915 --> 24:14.586
Chad Rodrick.

24:15.017 --> 24:16.608
You must be one lucky guy.

24:17.127 --> 24:19.923
You've been arrested for
possession of pseudoephedrine,

24:19.924 --> 24:22.044
possession of forged
triplicate prescriptions,

24:22.045 --> 24:25.228
and the manufacture of
a controlled substance,

24:25.229 --> 24:26.669
but never convicted.

24:26.980 --> 24:28.539
Those are all misunderstandings.

24:28.540 --> 24:30.273
I'm just a college student

24:30.354 --> 24:33.427
with my father's
lawyer on speed dial.

24:36.942 --> 24:37.645
You know why you're here?

24:37.646 --> 24:39.328
No, but I'm going to guess
it has something to do

24:39.329 --> 24:41.857
with class resentment.
I bet it's a special treat

24:41.858 --> 24:43.747
for you to interrogate
above your station.

24:44.179 --> 24:46.431
You're here because
you sold these...

24:48.335 --> 24:49.346
To him.

24:51.171 --> 24:52.963
But we're not dope cops, Chad.

24:52.964 --> 24:55.047
So these...
We don't care about.

24:55.048 --> 24:58.155
Him... we want.

25:03.691 --> 25:06.532
I'm afraid I can't help you.
You guys can't arrest me.

25:06.533 --> 25:08.044
You don't have proof of anything.

25:08.898 --> 25:12.045
Oh... we're not gonna
arrest you, Chad.

25:12.046 --> 25:14.958
We're just gonna detain
you for a while...

25:15.274 --> 25:16.439
In lockup.

25:16.566 --> 25:18.432
Yeah, we've got a
parolee in there.

25:18.550 --> 25:19.912
Sex offender...

25:20.114 --> 25:23.102
6'1", couple bills and change.

25:23.661 --> 25:25.068
They call him Peppermint.

25:25.079 --> 25:26.993
And he'd just love to
meet a handsome young man

25:26.994 --> 25:28.726
of your station.

25:28.727 --> 25:31.306
We know you sold
custom-blend Prazepam,

25:31.307 --> 25:33.070
which is a controlled substance,

25:33.071 --> 25:35.970
but... we're running
a special today.

25:36.606 --> 25:39.476
All we want to know is
where we can find him.

25:39.477 --> 25:40.412
Or...

25:40.936 --> 25:42.413
You can go to lockup...

25:42.919 --> 25:44.320
And meet your new friend.

25:45.331 --> 25:46.264
Listen...

25:47.780 --> 25:50.730
I sold those two weeks ago,
but not to him.

25:50.731 --> 25:52.379
I've never seen this
guy before in my life.

25:52.380 --> 25:54.734
Who bought the pills?
Jolene. She's one of my regulars.

25:54.735 --> 25:57.890
Tell me about her.
Blonde, 30s.

25:57.891 --> 26:00.236
I think she lives somewhere in Brooklyn. 
Last name?

26:00.237 --> 26:03.424
I don't know. She just shows
up when she wants something.

26:04.087 --> 26:06.341
I swear. I don't even know
how to get ahold of her.

26:12.242 --> 26:13.526
You talked to Montgomery?

26:13.759 --> 26:14.694
Yeah.

26:16.673 --> 26:19.120
Castle, there's something
I need you to do.

26:20.803 --> 26:21.775
Name it.

26:21.853 --> 26:22.787
Go home.

26:23.213 --> 26:26.282
Forget it. Fear does
not exist in this dojo.

26:26.323 --> 26:28.308
Look, I signed up for this
when I put that badge on.

26:28.309 --> 26:32.191
You didn't. It's not your fight.
The hell it isn't.

26:32.735 --> 26:35.143
I don't hang around
you just to annoy you.

26:35.144 --> 26:36.112
I don't ride out to murder scenes

26:36.113 --> 26:38.945
in the middle of the night to
satisfy some morbid curiosity.

26:39.412 --> 26:41.527
If that's all this was,
I would've quit a long time ago.

26:41.528 --> 26:43.760
Well, then why do you
keep coming back, Rick?

26:50.592 --> 26:52.964
Look, I may not have a badge,

26:53.636 --> 26:54.660
unless you count the chocolate one

26:54.661 --> 26:56.642
that Alexis gave
me for my birthday,

26:58.742 --> 26:59.880
but I'll tell you this...

26:59.881 --> 27:03.028
Like it or not,
I'm your plucky sidekick.

27:04.001 --> 27:06.315
Plucky sidekick
always gets killed.

27:08.181 --> 27:09.270
Your partner, then.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.308
Okay. What'd you find?

27:16.929 --> 27:19.048
You remember what Raglan
said back at the coffee shop

27:19.049 --> 27:21.262
about this thing going back 19 years?
Uh-huh.

27:21.263 --> 27:23.449
Turns out, before your mother,
there was another murder

27:23.450 --> 27:23.963
in this alley,

27:23.964 --> 27:26.553
back when it was the
back entrance to a club

27:26.554 --> 27:28.966
called Sons of Palermo.
It was a mafia hangout.

27:28.967 --> 27:30.130
I didn't know this was a club.

27:30.131 --> 27:32.341
Well, it got shut down years
before your mother was killed,

27:32.342 --> 27:35.014
after an FBI agent by
the name of Bob Armen

27:35.015 --> 27:37.636
was killed in the alley
behind it. It says Armen

27:37.637 --> 27:39.033
was working undercover
in the mafia.

27:39.034 --> 27:41.428
Somehow the mob got on to Armen,

27:41.450 --> 27:44.046
used the old family remedy.
Summary execution.

27:44.047 --> 27:46.169
The NYPD arrested a mob enforcer

27:46.170 --> 27:48.924
in Armen's murder...
a guy by the name of Joe Pulgatti.

27:48.925 --> 27:52.613
He later pled guilty. And guess
who the arresting officer was.

27:52.964 --> 27:54.331
Officer John Raglan.

27:54.332 --> 27:56.228
Your mother was a
civil rights attorney.

27:56.229 --> 27:58.247
Did she ever mention
Armen's murder

27:58.248 --> 27:59.599
or Pulgatti's conviction? 
No,

27:59.600 --> 28:01.907
but there's gotta be a
connection somewhere.

28:02.837 --> 28:04.975
I bet Pulgatti could
shed some light on it.

28:05.439 --> 28:07.301
I didn't kill Bobby Armen.

28:07.302 --> 28:08.975
Then why'd you plead guilty?

28:09.297 --> 28:10.928
'Cause I don't like needles.

28:10.931 --> 28:13.094
Detective Raglan
places you in the alley

28:13.095 --> 28:16.136
at the time of the murder.
Yeah, I was in that alley with Bobby.

28:16.137 --> 28:17.976
I was the only witness
to his murder,

28:17.977 --> 28:19.382
but it wasn't a hit.

28:19.383 --> 28:21.638
It was a kidnapping
that went sideways.

28:21.639 --> 28:24.575
Three guys in ski masks
rolled up in a van,

28:24.576 --> 28:27.926
said they wanted to take
me on a tour of the city.

28:27.970 --> 28:30.050
Bobby tried to stop 'em,
he went for one of their guns

28:30.051 --> 28:32.781
and wound up on the
wrong end of it.

28:32.782 --> 28:34.396
Were the guys from a rival family?

28:34.397 --> 28:37.077
No. No way. We had a
truce going back then

28:37.078 --> 28:38.150
because there was this, uh,

28:38.151 --> 28:40.102
ghost crew out there...
professional kidnappers

28:40.103 --> 28:42.505
targeting members of
all five families.

28:42.955 --> 28:45.542
Look, I was in that
alley with Bobby.

28:45.543 --> 28:47.525
But no one else
could've known that.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.643
It was a blind alley.

28:51.841 --> 28:54.244
And the only other people
in it when Bobby was shot

28:54.245 --> 28:56.421
were the people who shot him.

28:57.974 --> 28:59.762
So you tell me, detective...

29:00.658 --> 29:02.987
How could Raglan have
known I was there?

29:03.264 --> 29:05.555
You're saying Raglan was
one of the kidnappers?

29:09.593 --> 29:10.876
There was, uh...

29:11.655 --> 29:13.423
A lawyer named Johanna Beckett.

29:13.424 --> 29:14.360
Are you familiar with her?

29:14.361 --> 29:16.301
She was murdered in the alley

29:16.302 --> 29:18.867
about seven years into
your incarceration.

29:19.374 --> 29:21.123
You look just like her, you know?

29:23.114 --> 29:24.669
You first walked in here...

29:25.913 --> 29:27.856
It was like I was
looking at a ghost.

29:29.139 --> 29:30.395
The way she talked about you,

29:30.396 --> 29:32.522
I should've known
you'd become a cop.

29:34.037 --> 29:35.940
I-I-I sent letters...

29:36.096 --> 29:38.079
To every lawyer I could find.

29:39.011 --> 29:41.149
And your mother was the only one

29:41.462 --> 29:42.803
who wrote me back,

29:42.804 --> 29:45.287
the only one willing to
take a chance on me.

29:45.794 --> 29:47.711
She didn't care that I was a thug.

29:48.061 --> 29:49.668
All she cared about was the truth.

29:49.669 --> 29:50.853
She came to visit me here

29:50.854 --> 29:52.829
and she said she'd
look into my case.

29:53.305 --> 29:55.249
Later, I found out
she was murdered.

29:57.631 --> 30:00.084
Don't get yourself killed
chasing this thing.

30:00.389 --> 30:02.970
Take it from me. There's nothing
more dangerous out there

30:02.971 --> 30:04.755
than a killer with a badge.

30:14.534 --> 30:17.295
We'll talk about the definition
of a direct order later.

30:17.336 --> 30:18.887
Right now, I just want
to hear what you found.

30:18.888 --> 30:20.149
Okay, so here's what
we know so far...

30:20.150 --> 30:22.937
19 years ago, Raglan and
at least 2 other cops

30:22.938 --> 30:25.681
were kidnapping
mobsters for ransom.

30:25.682 --> 30:26.435
Things went south when they

30:26.436 --> 30:29.265
tried to snatch Joe Pulgatti.
They mistakenly killed

30:29.266 --> 30:31.635
an undercover fed named Bob Armen.

30:31.863 --> 30:32.702
To cover their asses,

30:32.703 --> 30:34.768
they pinned Armen's
murder on Pulgatti.

30:34.769 --> 30:35.728
And then seven years later,

30:35.729 --> 30:37.824
my mom and a group
of her colleagues

30:37.825 --> 30:40.367
tried to put together
an appeal for Pulgatti.

30:40.368 --> 30:42.736
Now the cops knew that if
the case got overturned,

30:42.737 --> 30:44.836
they would all be exposed.

30:44.964 --> 30:47.509
So they hired Dick Coonan
to kill all of them.

30:47.510 --> 30:49.157
And Raglan wrote
off their homicides

30:49.158 --> 30:51.830
as random gang violence. And
that would've been the end of it,

30:51.831 --> 30:53.614
but Raglan found out he was dying,

30:53.615 --> 30:55.443
decided he wanted to come clean.

30:55.600 --> 30:57.012
So they had to silence him, too.

30:57.013 --> 30:59.242
Pulgatti said that there were
three kidnappers in that van.

30:59.243 --> 31:01.910
That means there's at least two
conspirators out there now.

31:01.911 --> 31:03.196
And we already know
who one of 'em is...

31:03.197 --> 31:06.113
Raglan's old academy buddy, Gary McCallister.
How you know that?

31:06.114 --> 31:08.756
I pulled the dispatcher's
log from the archives.

31:08.796 --> 31:10.132
There was another
unit backing Raglan

31:10.133 --> 31:11.476
when he arrested Pulgatti...

31:11.477 --> 31:15.439
a one-man patrol unit...
Officer Gary McCallister.

31:16.838 --> 31:18.430
Get that son of a bitch.

31:19.559 --> 31:22.608
Vulcan Simmons had
nothing to do with this.

31:22.609 --> 31:24.980
But as a former cop,
you knew that he fit the part,

31:24.981 --> 31:27.294
and so you used him to throw us off

31:27.295 --> 31:29.050
when the truth is
that you and Raglan

31:29.051 --> 31:32.196
were up to your necks in
murder and kidnappings.

31:34.295 --> 31:36.547
Listen, it's easy for you
to sit in judgment now,

31:36.548 --> 31:38.064
but you weren't there.

31:38.338 --> 31:40.590
We did what we
thought we had to do.

31:40.591 --> 31:42.498
And you did plenty.

31:42.538 --> 31:45.081
Kidnapping, cover-ups.

31:45.082 --> 31:47.336
You killed a fed, and then
you pinned it on Pulgatti.

31:47.337 --> 31:49.490
You want me to tell you
about Joe Pulgatti,

31:49.491 --> 31:50.989
about the people he
put in the hospital,

31:50.990 --> 31:52.796
the ones he put in the river?

31:53.004 --> 31:55.898
He and the rest of those jackals
fed on this city for decades,

31:55.899 --> 31:59.279
but you couldn't touch them
because they bought everybody.

31:59.280 --> 32:01.196
And this part...
this part I want you to know,

32:01.197 --> 32:02.147
'cause this part
I'm not ashamed of,

32:02.148 --> 32:04.445
'cause at least we
tried to do something.

32:04.508 --> 32:08.312
It wasn't pretty and it wasn't legal,
but it was right.

32:08.313 --> 32:10.721
Kidnapping people for
ransom was right?

32:12.469 --> 32:14.577
We called it incarceration.

32:14.694 --> 32:15.953
Yeah, we grabbed
'em off the street,

32:15.954 --> 32:18.372
and we'd take them somewhere
and we'd tune them up.

32:18.373 --> 32:21.246
We put the fear of God into 'em,
at least for a while.

32:21.596 --> 32:23.745
But we knew we couldn't
hold 'em forever.

32:25.454 --> 32:26.775
So we set bail.

32:27.399 --> 32:29.183
And I'm here to tell you
that we set it high.

32:29.184 --> 32:31.177
If those bastards wanted
back on the street,

32:31.178 --> 32:32.949
they were gonna have
to pay for their way.

32:32.950 --> 32:35.310
When my mom put together
that appeal for Pulgatti,

32:35.311 --> 32:36.882
you got worried that
she'd get on to you,

32:36.883 --> 32:39.875
and so you hired Dick Coonan to kill her.
No.

32:39.876 --> 32:41.511
And then when Raglan
grew a conscience,

32:41.512 --> 32:42.903
you had him killed, too. 
No.

32:42.904 --> 32:45.194
I didn't have anything
to do with that.

32:46.488 --> 32:49.622
That was... that was somebody else.

32:49.623 --> 32:51.731
Who? 
Somebody you'll never touch.

32:51.732 --> 32:52.598
Who?

32:56.641 --> 32:58.735
You don't understand, detective.

32:59.550 --> 33:01.378
You woke the dragon.

33:02.099 --> 33:05.551
And this is so much
bigger than you realize.

33:07.184 --> 33:08.624
And I'm done talking.

33:08.857 --> 33:10.155
I want a lawyer.

33:11.035 --> 33:13.482
He's afraid of someone,
and it's not a cop.

33:14.937 --> 33:16.332
We gotta find that shooter.

33:16.683 --> 33:17.742
I think we got a lead on him.

33:17.743 --> 33:19.383
According to Rodrick,
a woman named Jolene

33:19.384 --> 33:20.864
bought those capsules
that we found

33:20.865 --> 33:22.806
in Lockwood's corporate suite.
Girlfriend?

33:22.807 --> 33:25.687
Probably. All we got is blonde,
30s, lives in Brooklyn.

33:25.688 --> 33:28.101
So we fed her descriptors
into the DMV database.

33:28.102 --> 33:29.775
Got it narrowed
down to two women...

33:29.776 --> 33:32.726
Jolene Granger and Jolene Anders.

33:33.077 --> 33:34.383
Okay, you guys take Jolene Anders.

33:34.384 --> 33:37.260
- We'll take Granger. You call me 
when you get her. - Roger that.

34:08.206 --> 34:10.406
Jolene Granger, NYPD.

34:12.398 --> 34:13.331
Jolene?

34:30.159 --> 34:30.992
Esposito.

34:30.993 --> 34:34.606
Jolene Granger is dead.
We're on our way. Let's go.

34:40.027 --> 34:41.272
Cover your ears!

34:41.875 --> 34:45.148
Esposito? Esposito?!

34:51.596 --> 34:53.996
So what do you got?
What you heard was a flash bang.

34:53.998 --> 34:55.208
Lockwood must've grabbed 'em.

34:55.210 --> 34:57.630
Only thing we've recovered
so far are their cell phones.

34:57.631 --> 35:00.781
He dumped both of their phones,
so we can't GPS track 'em.

35:00.782 --> 35:02.276
We couldn't find Jolene's
cell phone either.

35:02.277 --> 35:03.632
Lockwood must have
gotten rid of it.

35:03.633 --> 35:07.099
Because her phone was a link to him.
She called him on it.

35:07.100 --> 35:09.717
There's gotta be a cell phone
bill around here somewhere.

35:16.475 --> 35:18.612
I want to congratulate you both.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.944
I don't know how
you found my place,

35:21.372 --> 35:23.427
but I've been doing this
kind of work for a while now,

35:23.428 --> 35:25.552
and no one's ever
come that close to me.

35:25.943 --> 35:28.564
My problem is that
your investigation

35:28.565 --> 35:31.305
has gone further than I expected.

35:31.306 --> 35:33.424
And now in order for
me to finish my job,

35:33.425 --> 35:37.327
I need to know exactly
what you know about me

35:37.328 --> 35:38.919
and my employer.

35:42.069 --> 35:46.378
Now I got a lot of
respect for you guys.

35:48.229 --> 35:49.395
What?
I do.

35:50.534 --> 35:53.063
Now I'm gonna make you a deal.

35:53.253 --> 35:54.824
You tell me what I need to know,

35:54.825 --> 35:56.829
one pro to another,

35:57.890 --> 36:00.182
and I will put
bullet in your brain.

36:00.487 --> 36:01.497
You don't,

36:02.390 --> 36:04.180
you jerk me around,

36:05.188 --> 36:09.290
and you will be begging me
to before this night is up.

36:19.271 --> 36:21.058
I'm gonna have to
go with option "B."

36:21.081 --> 36:22.014
Oh, yeah.

36:23.149 --> 36:24.939
We're definitely gonna
jerk you around.

36:28.087 --> 36:28.875
What's her account number?

36:28.876 --> 36:33.315
58-92-639-11-99.

36:33.403 --> 36:35.625
All right. If we can figure
out her mother's maiden name,

36:35.626 --> 36:37.055
they'll e-mail us the password.

36:37.056 --> 36:38.896
I need everything you can
get on Jolene Granger,

36:38.897 --> 36:41.643
specifically her
mother's maiden name.

36:51.436 --> 36:52.797
Listen, ass clown,

36:53.312 --> 36:55.548
I was in catholic
school for 12 years.

36:55.549 --> 36:58.309
Hell. They used to do this
to me for talking in cla...

36:58.528 --> 36:59.989
You're dead, Lockwood. 
Yeah,

36:59.990 --> 37:01.987
you know, they always
start off with bravado.

37:01.988 --> 37:04.644
The begging comes later.
See, this is ice cold water.

37:04.645 --> 37:06.781
It'll burn like hell
when it hits his lungs,

37:06.782 --> 37:08.606
but he won't lose
consciousness right away.

37:08.607 --> 37:12.659
But all this stops when you
tell me how much the cops know!

37:14.526 --> 37:16.317
Lockwood would've been one of
the last numbers she called.

37:16.318 --> 37:16.865
Uh, got it.

37:16.866 --> 37:21.627
Uh, 917-555-0176

37:21.628 --> 37:23.837
I need a GPS track.
Castle, you've done it again.

37:25.175 --> 37:26.359
That guy is gonna
spot a S.W.A.T. team

37:26.360 --> 37:29.044
from a block away, 
warn Lockwood.

37:31.024 --> 37:33.358
We call in the cavalry,
and they're both dead.

37:35.339 --> 37:37.088
I'm open to dumb ideas here.

37:38.252 --> 37:40.008
Good. 'Cause I got one.

37:55.567 --> 37:57.473
He's not buying it, Castle.

38:31.280 --> 38:32.602
That was amazing.

38:35.876 --> 38:37.154
The... the way you knocked
him out, I mean.

38:37.155 --> 38:38.091
It was...

38:41.273 --> 38:42.071
Let's go.

38:42.072 --> 38:42.966
Yeah.

38:50.078 --> 38:50.974
Okay!

38:53.887 --> 38:56.556
Ohh. Don't tell this
jack hole anything.

38:56.557 --> 38:58.502
I'm sorry, bro.
I can't watch this.

38:58.503 --> 39:01.767
Listen to me. You're too late.

39:02.273 --> 39:05.769
The cops already know all
about me and your mom.

39:08.489 --> 39:10.005
Shoot out one of his kneecaps.

39:10.006 --> 39:10.518
No!

39:10.519 --> 39:12.712
No! No! Hey!

39:12.713 --> 39:15.391
No! Come on. No! Hey!

40:14.543 --> 40:15.485
You okay?

40:15.486 --> 40:16.419
