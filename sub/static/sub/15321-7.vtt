WEBVTT

00:08.092 --> 00:10.299
The maid
probably just moved it.

00:10.636 --> 00:12.888
Always be putting my gideons
in the drawer,

00:12.889 --> 00:15.301
making me lose
my place in exodus.

00:16.142 --> 00:18.133
The drawing was packed away.

00:18.561 --> 00:21.348
This was a message.

00:21.814 --> 00:24.681
Whoever did this
knows things about me.

00:28.779 --> 00:31.236
That old case
you were working on?

00:31.782 --> 00:34.114
Is that what Carlson
was talking about?

00:40.917 --> 00:42.953
You need to trust me
on this, Linden.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.666
We're safe.

00:45.379 --> 00:46.789
No one ever comes around here,

00:46.797 --> 00:49.209
not even Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:53.721 --> 00:56.212
Only thing we got to worry about
is the young 'un robbing us.

00:56.807 --> 00:58.798
I said roll for me, not rob me.

00:58.809 --> 01:00.185
You owe me rent.

01:00.186 --> 01:02.393
Yeah. Rent on pioneer square
ain't two G's.

01:03.481 --> 01:05.688
I think your zen rock garden
and fountain

01:05.691 --> 01:07.431
are what's really
gonna help me relax.

01:07.443 --> 01:10.560
Laugh it up, Linden.
My dojo is a sanctuary of light.

01:17.495 --> 01:19.281
All right. How much?

01:20.081 --> 01:20.911
- 2 G's.
- 2 G's...

02:12.466 --> 02:14.422
Now, I know this farmer, right?

02:14.427 --> 02:16.338
It's sick what they do
to them chickens.

02:16.345 --> 02:19.087
And then he tells me
it's lonely on a farm.

02:19.098 --> 02:20.884
That's why you got to buy
organic eggs.

02:20.891 --> 02:22.472
'Cause you never know what's
been inside of a chicken.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.467
You know what I'm saying?

02:25.104 --> 02:26.969
She rises from the dead.

02:26.981 --> 02:29.222
Told you posturepedic
is the shiznit.

02:29.233 --> 02:30.609
What are you making?

02:30.610 --> 02:33.602
Just an all-natural
Mexican-American breakfast.

02:33.613 --> 02:34.773
Good morning, mom.

02:34.780 --> 02:37.613
Morning.
Do you need help?

02:37.617 --> 02:40.654
No. Take a load off.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.826
We got you.

02:43.039 --> 02:44.495
Oh, just a heads up.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.204
There's a poison—control number
on top of the fridge

02:46.208 --> 02:48.585
in case you go into shock
since this ain't freeze-dried.

02:48.586 --> 02:50.747
Ha ha ha.

02:52.214 --> 02:54.671
Hey, uh, get the Habanero Jelly
out of the fridge,

02:54.675 --> 02:56.540
mix it with them eggs,
and boom.

02:56.552 --> 02:58.668
We got spicy and sweet in one.

03:01.098 --> 03:03.555
See you found
my knowledge corner.

03:04.018 --> 03:05.679
There's a bookstore
down on Jones Street...

03:06.354 --> 03:08.436
you get a crate of books
for a quarter.

03:08.439 --> 03:10.896
But you can't put a price on wisdom.
ain't that right, little man?

03:10.900 --> 03:12.811
- I guess.
- You guess?

03:13.319 --> 03:15.310
Ain't no guesswork for seekers.

03:16.030 --> 03:17.611
Monarchs.

03:17.615 --> 03:19.355
They left about a month ago.

03:19.367 --> 03:22.029
Should be down in Cali by now,
and then down in Mexico.

03:22.036 --> 03:23.867
Come on. Let's eat.

03:23.871 --> 03:27.034
Speaking of travel plans,
you and klepto here...

03:27.041 --> 03:30.158
you're welcome to crash here
as long as you need.

03:32.755 --> 03:34.837
Thanks. It was just
for the night.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.172
Of course.
It's just too much fun here.

03:42.515 --> 03:44.051
- Linden.
- It's, uh, Ray.

03:44.058 --> 03:45.673
Look, I know Carlson told me

03:45.685 --> 03:47.676
not to dedicate any more time
to the Larsen case.

03:47.687 --> 03:49.052
What do you got, Ray?

03:49.563 --> 03:52.145
Rosie 's voicemail...
from yesterday...

03:52.149 --> 03:55.858
Analyst l'm tight with,
local FBI task-force guy,

03:55.861 --> 03:56.976
took a listen.

03:56.987 --> 03:59.899
That weird buzzing noise
that starts three seconds in?

03:59.907 --> 04:01.408
He said it could be
the cooling fan

04:01.409 --> 04:03.491
of a portable diesel generator

04:03.494 --> 04:06.076
The most popular users
are construction companies.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.536
What about the other sounds,

04:07.540 --> 04:09.656
your guy confirm
it was some kind of a door?

04:09.667 --> 04:11.248
Yeah, sliding door.

04:11.252 --> 04:14.210
Flush-fin construction probably,
glass inset.

04:14.630 --> 04:17.417
Okay, got it. No need
for Carlson to get the memo.

04:17.425 --> 04:19.290
I got to go.

04:21.220 --> 04:23.927
Rosie's call most likely came
from a construction site,

04:23.931 --> 04:26.297
probably inside the casino.

04:26.308 --> 04:28.765
Ames was trying to hide why
he was doing business there.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.384
Go to the County Recorder's Office.

04:30.396 --> 04:32.933
Get any business records between
Ames' construction company

04:32.940 --> 04:34.396
and the casino.

04:34.400 --> 04:37.187
Let's find out exactly
what they were building there.

04:37.194 --> 04:39.526
Jack, are you all packed up?

04:39.530 --> 04:41.066
I haven't finished
my breakfast.

04:41.073 --> 04:43.735
Yo, you got to try some
of my Habanero-Jelly eggs.

04:43.743 --> 04:45.279
I'm not hungry.

04:45.286 --> 04:47.026
All right, well,
just so you know,

04:47.037 --> 04:49.904
there's a spare key
under the green flowerpot.

04:49.915 --> 04:53.373
Just in case all the hotels
are booked or something.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.914
Keep your head up, little man.

05:05.264 --> 05:07.550
You're early. I still have to do
my physical therapy.

05:07.558 --> 05:09.970
I told the nurse to push it
back so we could start now.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.559
Commissioner's apology ran
on page one this morning.

05:12.563 --> 05:15.145
Yeah, below the fold and under
the Seahawks preview.

05:15.149 --> 05:16.639
You've publicly been
branded a killer.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.141
And we have less than seven days
to change voters' minds.

05:19.153 --> 05:21.189
And short of the cops
finding the actual killer,

05:21.197 --> 05:22.983
nothing we say
is gonna make a difference.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.481
Which is why we're gonna get
the Larsens to do it...

05:25.493 --> 05:27.154
And publicly absolve you
from any blame

05:27.161 --> 05:28.367
in their daughter's death.

05:28.370 --> 05:30.201
They'll never agree.
We tried this.

05:30.206 --> 05:32.322
I know the prosecutor
charging Stan Larsen

05:32.333 --> 05:33.698
for the kidnap and assault
of Bennet Ahmed.

05:33.709 --> 05:34.869
Who is it?
Preston.

05:34.877 --> 05:36.333
He owes me.

05:36.337 --> 05:39.204
He might be willing to agree
to a lighter sentence if I ask.

05:41.467 --> 05:43.628
Should be incentive enough for
the Larsens to come down

05:43.636 --> 05:45.501
to city hall
and read a simple statement.

05:45.513 --> 05:47.845
I'm all for it.
Just know if you do it,

05:47.848 --> 05:50.134
you're gonna be throwing Ahmed
under the bus.

05:56.065 --> 05:57.726
Do it. All right.

05:57.733 --> 05:58.939
We're gonna have to
have the presser here, though.

05:58.943 --> 06:00.729
Leaving the hospital
is too hard for Darren.

06:00.736 --> 06:03.398
We'll have to re-dress
the waiting room.

06:08.619 --> 06:09.859
Gwen.

06:10.329 --> 06:13.787
Preston's a law-and-order dick.
He doesn't cut deals.

06:13.791 --> 06:16.999
I know that.
Stan Larsen doesn't need to.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.679
Mr. Larsen?

06:45.155 --> 06:47.612
Principal Meyers said
they ran out of lockers,

06:47.616 --> 06:49.948
so they had to give Rosie's
to a new student.

06:49.952 --> 06:53.490
But I think it was really
because...

06:53.497 --> 06:56.910
You know, what the papers
have been saying about her.

06:58.961 --> 07:01.794
I thought maybe
you and Mrs. Larsen

07:01.797 --> 07:03.458
might want this stuff.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.508
Did Rosie ever talk

07:08.512 --> 07:11.549
about an old shoe box
of her mom's that she had?

07:11.557 --> 07:14.048
- No.
- No?

07:14.059 --> 07:15.845
No. Why?

07:26.572 --> 07:29.029
Was she happy?

07:29.033 --> 07:31.194
Yeah.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.992
I mean, I think she was.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.660
The last time I saw her...

07:40.586 --> 07:43.953
She was standing there...
by the stairs.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.757
l was on the phone in here.

07:48.761 --> 07:52.629
She stood there for a while,
just looking at me like she...

07:53.349 --> 07:54.338
Like what?

07:54.767 --> 08:01.980
Like she was... sad.

08:04.485 --> 08:10.401
| forgot till just now
how she looked standing there.

08:24.797 --> 08:27.163
Mr. Larsen?

08:28.133 --> 08:31.341
l, uh... I got to go.

08:31.345 --> 08:35.133
My mom gave me a ride here.
She's waiting for me.

09:03.627 --> 09:05.208
There's cameras
in every hallway,

09:05.212 --> 09:07.373
and someone's at the desk
24 hours.

09:10.676 --> 09:11.961
I'll be home for dinner,

09:11.969 --> 09:14.836
but you should order something
from room service for lunch.

09:15.806 --> 09:18.172
And, uh...
Just this once,

09:18.183 --> 09:20.048
I'll let you order a movie.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.051
...If you would
like to donate blood

09:22.062 --> 09:23.472
to help victims,

09:23.480 --> 09:25.345
you can do so by contacting
your local red cross.

09:25.357 --> 09:27.143
I'll put the
"Do not disturb" sign out

09:27.151 --> 09:29.392
in case the maid comes by,
but...

09:32.114 --> 09:33.945
You should make sure
that you...

09:33.949 --> 09:37.066
put the chain on the door
after I leave.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.609
Jack.

09:41.999 --> 09:44.331
If there's a fire or something
like that, and you're trapped,

09:44.334 --> 09:46.746
use the bathroom window
to get out and call for help.

09:47.129 --> 09:49.165
I thought we were safe here.

09:49.173 --> 09:52.665
We are. I'm being
extra cautious, that's all.

09:52.676 --> 09:55.292
Just promise me
you'll stay put?

09:56.597 --> 09:58.633
I mean it.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.307
Yeah, okay. Whatever.

10:08.650 --> 10:09.730
Yeah, Holder.

10:09.735 --> 10:10.895
Hey, I got that connect

10:10.903 --> 10:12.234
between Ames
and the casino, Linden.

10:12.237 --> 10:15.525
Okay.
l-l'll meet you there.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.397
I'm on the next ferry.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.518
I had to pull some strings,
give out some HJ's,

10:43.519 --> 10:45.180
but I found Ames'
construction company...

10:45.187 --> 10:46.302
Columbia Domain Fund.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.974
State taxes filed
in the last two quarters

10:47.981 --> 10:49.642
are on the up and up,
no red flags.

10:49.650 --> 10:50.981
But check this...

10:50.984 --> 10:54.317
For their $50 million casino
job, CDF turned zero profit.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.312
Clerk there said
no way that ever happens.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.563
Likeliest scenario

10:57.574 --> 10:59.610
is that the project was either
put on hold or abandoned.

10:59.618 --> 11:01.074
What were they building?

11:01.078 --> 11:03.364
That's the $6 million question
'cause it could be anything.

11:03.372 --> 11:06.284
All it says is
"Hotel/Casino renovations."

11:08.168 --> 11:12.161
Walk around, talk to customers,
employees.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.504
You know, just, uh...

11:16.718 --> 11:18.709
Just try to blend in.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.382
I'm everyone and no one.

11:21.390 --> 11:23.051
J” Ain't no half steppin' .l’

11:23.058 --> 11:24.559
So, what are you
gonna be doing,

11:24.560 --> 11:27.518
just playing wheelman
in the parking lot?

11:28.313 --> 11:29.814
Got it.

11:30.816 --> 11:33.478
Yo, you stole that from my dojo.
It's part of a set.

11:33.485 --> 11:35.316
Rosie filmed
the butterfly migration

11:35.320 --> 11:36.651
out here at Point Yubec.

11:36.655 --> 11:38.156
Maybe she saw something.

11:38.157 --> 11:41.149
Yeah, inside the casino.

11:41.160 --> 11:43.993
Nicole Jackson has this whole
island under her thumb.

11:43.996 --> 11:45.657
The tribal leaders
have said publicly

11:45.664 --> 11:46.995
that she robs the reservation,

11:46.999 --> 11:50.457
she pockets all
of the casino's profits.

11:50.460 --> 11:51.961
Rosie had secrets.

11:51.962 --> 11:55.125
She went all over the city
with that camera.

11:55.132 --> 11:58.465
Maybe she... saw something

11:58.468 --> 12:00.299
or was looking for something...

12:00.304 --> 12:01.714
Maybe out here.

12:01.722 --> 12:04.179
So, what, you're
the ghost whisperer now?

12:09.730 --> 12:11.266
I think Rosie felt trapped.

12:11.273 --> 12:14.106
She covered her walls
in butterflies.

12:14.109 --> 12:15.724
She climbed out
onto her roof at night

12:15.736 --> 12:16.976
to feel free.

12:16.987 --> 12:18.978
Is that what got you in trouble
on the Picasso case...

12:18.989 --> 12:22.106
You talking mumbo jumbo
to the dead person?

12:31.001 --> 12:34.289
You can walk from here.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.663
Next time you talk to Rosie,

12:37.674 --> 12:39.210
why don't you ask her
who killed her?

12:39.218 --> 12:40.628
Save me doing
real detective work.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.425
You know, Jack's been telling me
you haven't been sleeping.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.595
I mean, he's worried about you.

12:48.602 --> 12:51.719
So don't go all looney tunes,
you know, for his sake.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.061
You're right.

12:53.065 --> 12:56.102
I hear there's a 12—step program
for shitty moms like me.

12:56.109 --> 12:59.101
Yo, I'm just saying you might
want to step back a little.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.443
You think 'cause you made us
some omelettes,

13:00.447 --> 13:02.733
you know what's best for Jack?
Some breakfast burritos.

13:02.741 --> 13:05.699
Go deal with your own problems.
I've got mine covered.

13:06.995 --> 13:09.987
Yeah, you do.

13:09.998 --> 13:11.613
You talk
to your sponsor lately?

13:11.625 --> 13:13.286
You might
want to give him a call,

13:13.293 --> 13:16.285
make sure you don't go
off the rails again.

13:16.296 --> 13:19.413
Yeah, well, at least
I own my addiction.

14:57.522 --> 15:00.059
So, why are you here?
What do you want?

15:00.067 --> 15:01.523
Mr. Larsen, first of all,

15:01.526 --> 15:04.188
we want to offer our condolences
to you and your family.

15:04.196 --> 15:06.027
We can't even imagine
what you and your wife

15:06.031 --> 15:07.692
- have been through...
- I got a lot to do.

15:07.699 --> 15:08.779
Get to the point.

15:08.784 --> 15:10.900
Councilman Richmond
would like to know

15:10.911 --> 15:13.118
if you'd be willing
to read a statement

15:13.121 --> 15:14.782
that publicly supports him.

15:14.790 --> 15:16.621
As you know,
he was wrongfully arrested.

15:16.625 --> 15:18.581
And right now,
the councilman's top priority

15:18.585 --> 15:20.826
is bringing your daughter's
killer to justice.

15:22.589 --> 15:25.922
You think you're the first
person to try and sell me that?

15:25.926 --> 15:29.418
You're not here for Rosie.
Why don't you guys just get...

15:29.429 --> 15:31.420
I talked to the ADA
who's handling your case.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.137
He and the councilman
are old friends.

15:33.141 --> 15:35.632
He's open to reducing
your sentence.

15:35.644 --> 15:38.886
He might be even willing
to help you avoid prison time.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.102
I want to see a deal...
on paper.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.941
And we'll get that to you,

15:44.945 --> 15:46.856
but right now,
we have a press conference

15:46.863 --> 15:48.524
scheduled for tonight.

15:48.532 --> 15:49.863
The election's
in less than seven days,

15:49.866 --> 15:51.242
and we need to move quickly.

15:51.243 --> 15:55.077
Like I said, I still need
to see it in writing.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.617
You can reach us
at this number.

16:00.335 --> 16:02.667
The councilman is innocent.

16:02.671 --> 16:04.957
Right now, he's in a hospital,
paralyzed.

16:04.965 --> 16:07.297
l was sorry to hear
about your friend.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.087
It's a shame how the media
can mislead people.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.125
Yo, Linden,
you'll be happy to hear

17:26.129 --> 17:27.505
that while you're out
chasing butterflies,

17:27.506 --> 17:29.087
I'm in here busting my ass.

17:29.090 --> 17:32.457
Nobody's talking and nothing's
renovated in this piss hole.

17:32.469 --> 17:34.255
I'm thinking it's
in the hotel somewhere,

17:34.262 --> 17:36.002
but security's gonna grab my ass

17:36.014 --> 17:38.130
if I keep walking
around like this.

17:59.788 --> 18:02.450
Look who it is.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.039
My man...

18:06.169 --> 18:07.830
Myron.

18:08.463 --> 18:10.704
Got a feeling you're gonna
help your brother out..

18:13.260 --> 18:14.716
Yeah.

18:17.722 --> 18:19.883
Hit me again, brother.

18:20.559 --> 18:23.767
Boom. That's what
I'm talking about.

18:28.692 --> 18:30.148
Damn, brother.

18:30.151 --> 18:32.528
I thought you were gonna
hook a brother up.

18:33.280 --> 18:36.317
Blackjack ain't the action
I'm looking for anyways.

18:36.324 --> 18:38.531
I'm more looking
for a "room service,

18:38.535 --> 18:40.491
"bury the hatchet"
kind of action.

18:40.495 --> 18:42.486
You know what I'm saying?

18:45.750 --> 18:47.866
Ye-e-e-ah.

18:47.877 --> 18:49.868
That's what I'm talking about.

18:49.879 --> 18:52.837
Give that to the bartender.
He'll hook you up.

18:54.843 --> 18:57.505
You know if they're doing
any renovations in the hotel?

18:57.512 --> 18:59.218
Last time l was here,
I got the crabs

18:59.222 --> 19:01.599
in one of them
skanky-ass rooms.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.556
The girls will know
about them rooms.

19:03.560 --> 19:04.845
Ask them.

19:04.853 --> 19:06.889
Thanks, brother.

19:12.402 --> 19:15.018
Stan Larsen won't do it.

19:15.739 --> 19:17.320
Even with the offer we've made?

19:17.324 --> 19:19.315
Preston backed off.
He wasn't...

19:19.326 --> 19:23.911
The deal was a bluff.
It was my call. It didn't work.

19:23.913 --> 19:26.404
You needed this, Darren.

19:26.416 --> 19:27.576
The parents of the dead girl

19:27.584 --> 19:28.994
could have turned it
around for you.

19:29.002 --> 19:31.163
So you lied to them.

19:31.171 --> 19:33.412
I told you I'd win this race.
I didn't tell you how.

19:33.423 --> 19:35.129
Look, even if Larsen said yes,

19:35.133 --> 19:36.293
it's probably not the best idea

19:36.301 --> 19:37.962
for us to put him
in front of the camera.

19:37.969 --> 19:40.005
He's a grieving wreck.

19:40.013 --> 19:42.504
Real Debbie Downer.
But we can't cancel the presser.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.130
Otherwise, there'll be
endless speculation

19:44.142 --> 19:45.552
that it's
about your health, so...

19:45.560 --> 19:46.720
We're gonna lead
with your health,

19:46.728 --> 19:48.093
we're gonna get out there
and talk about it.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.605
Talk about how quickly
you're recovering.

19:49.606 --> 19:51.016
How you're more dedicated
than ever.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.686
How running is more important
than walking.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.900
Voters will be inspired
by your commitment to them.

19:59.491 --> 20:02.949
Okay. Great. We'll draft it.

20:05.163 --> 20:06.494
They're still gonna ask you

20:06.498 --> 20:08.580
where you were the night
the Larsen girl was killed.

20:08.583 --> 20:13.168
And I'll tell them the truth.
I was in Tacoma with you.

21:13.815 --> 21:16.272
Sacred burial grounds.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.980
We believe our bodies
are a gift to Mother Earth,

21:19.988 --> 21:23.025
a final tribute for the land
she provided.

21:25.285 --> 21:28.072
The casino also a gift to her?

21:28.288 --> 21:31.030
To our people.

21:31.207 --> 21:33.994
So we may continue
to be self—supporting,

21:34.002 --> 21:36.994
not rely on your government.

21:37.005 --> 21:40.793
Looks to be supporting you
more than your people.

21:43.511 --> 21:45.672
I know Rosie Larsen was here...

21:45.680 --> 21:48.342
and inside your casino.

21:54.606 --> 21:57.097
Used to be a beautiful view.

21:57.108 --> 22:00.600
When I was a girl,
I remember fishing out here

22:00.612 --> 22:03.604
and hearing the story
of Keylela,

22:03.615 --> 22:06.527
who always canoed out
past our shores,

22:06.534 --> 22:10.026
exploring,
looking for adventure.

22:10.413 --> 22:12.699
The elders warned her
not to go so far,

22:12.707 --> 22:15.665
but she didn't listen.

22:15.668 --> 22:18.580
Then one day,
she didn't come back.

22:19.214 --> 22:22.627
The water swallowed her
for her disobedience.

22:22.634 --> 22:25.797
When the wind blows
through the totems,

22:25.804 --> 22:30.298
it's Keylela begging the elders
for forgiveness,

22:30.308 --> 22:32.970
so she can come back home.

22:35.855 --> 22:39.063
When I was older,
I found out the story was a lie.

22:39.067 --> 22:41.558
Keylela was just a 9-year—old
girl who got lost

22:41.569 --> 22:43.275
and wandered off our land.

22:43.279 --> 22:45.656
A week later, she was found,

22:45.657 --> 22:48.444
beaten and tied to a tree.

22:52.997 --> 22:55.909
A warning from the white man.

22:57.836 --> 22:59.622
I'm a cop.

23:00.088 --> 23:03.876
Anything can happen
on this land, detective.

23:05.802 --> 23:08.418
You've been warned.

23:47.051 --> 23:50.009
I already said
all l have to say.

23:51.639 --> 23:55.097
| only came here because
I wanted you to hear it from me.

23:57.186 --> 24:00.929
I absolutely had nothing to do
with your daughter's murder.

24:03.359 --> 24:06.943
My heart goes out
to your family...

24:08.072 --> 24:09.653
Neither you or your family

24:09.657 --> 24:13.570
ever have to do a thing for me.

24:16.039 --> 24:17.529
I know you think
you're helping me

24:17.540 --> 24:20.623
- with those charges, too, but...
- No, no.

24:20.627 --> 24:24.040
The ADA won't do
anything about that.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.753
My people promised something
they couldn't deliver,

24:26.758 --> 24:29.374
and that was wrong.

24:30.219 --> 24:32.426
You deserve the truth.

24:39.896 --> 24:42.603
I'm sorry about
what happened to you.

24:46.194 --> 24:48.731
I've lost more...

24:49.697 --> 24:52.439
As have you.

24:55.036 --> 24:57.072
The papers...
They, uh...

24:58.247 --> 25:01.375
They're just printing lies
about Rosie.

25:01.376 --> 25:05.085
The school gave her locker
away to another kid.

25:07.674 --> 25:11.132
Nobody cares
about my daughter anymore.

25:13.846 --> 25:16.462
Then make them.

25:17.266 --> 25:20.599
Make them care about her.

25:33.992 --> 25:36.028
Here you go.

25:36.995 --> 25:39.828
I hear you're looking
for a good time.

25:39.831 --> 25:42.243
I'm always looking
for a good time, baby,

25:42.250 --> 25:45.492
especially with a pretty
young thing like you.

25:47.839 --> 25:50.922
So, lead the way
to your room, sexy.

25:51.759 --> 25:53.545
You got a room, right?

25:53.553 --> 25:56.886
Did they ever finish renovating
any of those new rooms?

25:57.598 --> 25:59.884
Still under construction.

26:00.518 --> 26:03.430
Look, you don't got a room,
we can do it in your car.

26:03.438 --> 26:05.269
Head's $20, tail's $50.

26:05.273 --> 26:06.433
I'll give you $100

26:06.441 --> 26:09.558
if we do it
at the construction site.

26:09.569 --> 26:11.525
I like that thing, you know.

26:11.696 --> 26:13.903
No one's supposed to go
up there.

26:15.158 --> 26:17.023
No dice, baby.

26:17.035 --> 26:19.947
Mm. You sure?

26:22.498 --> 26:24.238
Hmm?

26:24.250 --> 26:26.241
I'm out.

26:26.502 --> 26:29.869
Aw, come on, mami,
you making me all hot.

26:29.881 --> 26:32.543
You want...

26:58.743 --> 27:00.825
Like it dirty, white boy?
I got dirty.

27:00.828 --> 27:04.161
Yeah, see, l-l-l'm in,
but... but not here.

27:04.165 --> 27:06.656
You know, like I said,
I want to do it at the site.

27:06.667 --> 27:08.407
You want to wear a hard hat

27:08.419 --> 27:10.626
or ride me bare back,
macho man?

27:10.630 --> 27:13.167
I'm not riding you neither way
until we're up there.

27:13.716 --> 27:15.502
Give me the cash.

27:15.510 --> 27:18.297
Uh, not until you tell me
where we're going.

27:19.722 --> 27:21.678
10th floor.

27:21.682 --> 27:24.344
Don't you worry.
Best money you'll ever spend.

27:24.352 --> 27:27.810
Yeah. I just blew my wad,
Freddy.

27:32.193 --> 27:34.024
Name's Benny, asshole.

27:34.529 --> 27:36.065
All right, Benny boy.

28:37.091 --> 28:39.628
My badge and my gun.

28:45.391 --> 28:48.007
Have a safe trip back,
detective.

29:02.366 --> 29:04.482
You and me both, baby.

29:14.212 --> 29:15.998
Hold the door, please.

29:31.145 --> 29:32.851
For your cigarettes.

29:33.981 --> 29:36.563
Nah, I got a lighter.
Thanks.

29:43.449 --> 29:46.407
I hope Rosie's finally
got her backpack okay.

29:46.410 --> 29:48.071
What? Wait!

30:06.806 --> 30:09.138
Heard you were looking
for a party.

30:10.643 --> 30:13.510
Holder, where are you?

30:13.521 --> 30:15.557
Nicole Jackson and her goons
are chasing me off the island,

30:15.564 --> 30:16.895
so if you're still
in the casino,

30:16.899 --> 30:18.685
you've got to get out of there.

30:31.122 --> 30:33.488
Yuck.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.785
Come on, now.
It's not that bad.

30:36.794 --> 30:39.706
Hey, dad, mine's gonna be
a spider,

30:39.714 --> 30:41.796
like the one
on spider-man.

30:41.799 --> 30:43.664
That's great, buddy.

30:44.635 --> 30:46.171
I moved all the crap
off the table.

30:46.178 --> 30:48.920
I didn't know
if this was important.

30:50.182 --> 30:54.767
Nah, just a couple people
come by, wanting something.

30:55.187 --> 30:57.439
Them and everybody else, right?

30:58.190 --> 31:00.351
Were they policemen, too?

31:00.359 --> 31:01.735
What?

31:02.194 --> 31:04.571
The police talked to aunt Terry
at school yesterday.

31:08.242 --> 31:10.574
Those two cops just bugging me
with their questions.

31:10.578 --> 31:11.909
A waste of time.

31:11.912 --> 31:13.493
You got to put your hand
in there.

31:13.497 --> 31:16.159
Wait.
Questions about what?

31:16.542 --> 31:18.078
Nothing. Just...

31:18.085 --> 31:21.248
You know.

31:21.255 --> 31:24.964
Thinking they got their...
I don't know. Nothing.

31:24.967 --> 31:27.344
Boys, go to your room.

31:27.345 --> 31:29.506
- But, dad, I'm not even...
- Now!

31:47.156 --> 31:49.442
What did they ask you about?

31:55.289 --> 31:58.076
Michael. My boyfriend.

31:58.918 --> 32:00.783
The one who kicked me out.

32:02.755 --> 32:07.089
What does your boyfriend
have to do with Rosie?

32:07.093 --> 32:09.835
Hmm? Look at me.

32:14.892 --> 32:19.682
He's... Jasper's father.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.188
What...

32:24.735 --> 32:30.196
does your boyfriend
have to do with Rosie?

32:40.209 --> 32:44.623
Me and him...

32:44.630 --> 32:46.916
met...

32:48.509 --> 32:50.966
through Beau Soleil.

32:56.016 --> 32:57.176
I'm sorry.

32:57.184 --> 33:00.267
I should have told you,
but I was scared.

33:02.898 --> 33:06.516
I didn't know that Rosie had
anything to do with that.

33:07.445 --> 33:09.151
I never told her
about Beau Soleil,

33:09.155 --> 33:10.986
- I swear.
- You need to leave.

33:10.990 --> 33:12.105
You know, l-l don't know.

33:12.116 --> 33:14.732
You need to leave.

33:14.743 --> 33:16.870
I'm s... it doesn't make sense
to me.

33:16.871 --> 33:19.613
Because Rosie would never
do anything like that.

33:19.623 --> 33:21.579
She just went on the website
once, that's it.

33:21.584 --> 33:24.371
Get out of my house!!

33:49.862 --> 33:51.193
Yeah, that's fine, Ray.

33:51.197 --> 33:52.858
But right now, I need you
to find out everything you can

33:52.865 --> 33:54.856
about the burial grounds
near Point Yubec

33:54.867 --> 33:57.028
on the Wapi Reservation.

33:57.036 --> 33:58.822
Will you just do it?!

34:04.585 --> 34:05.995
Hey, get away from my son!

34:06.003 --> 34:07.994
Easy, Detective Linden, easy.

34:08.005 --> 34:09.666
Who are you?
How do you know my name?

34:09.673 --> 34:12.005
I'm officer Miller.
This is Officer Flynn.

34:12.009 --> 34:15.342
We're with Child
Protective Services.

34:15.846 --> 34:18.508
We need to inspect
your place of residence.

34:18.516 --> 34:22.509
This is your current place
of residence, isn't it?

34:22.520 --> 34:25.182
Why?
Why are you here?

34:25.189 --> 34:26.520
Our offices received a call

34:26.524 --> 34:28.389
alleging neglect
of your minor son.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.311
We're here to investigate
those charges

34:30.319 --> 34:31.980
and speak to Jack.

34:32.404 --> 34:34.110
Get inside, Jack.

34:35.950 --> 34:38.236
You don't want
to do that, miss Linden.

34:49.296 --> 34:50.547
Really?

34:51.298 --> 34:52.959
No, easy there, thunderheart.

34:52.967 --> 34:54.958
We don't got a safety word yet.

34:54.969 --> 34:57.802
Yo, you got this all wrong.
Man, I'm a cop.

34:57.805 --> 34:59.466
Not here you ain't.

34:59.473 --> 35:01.885
Just call your boss,
and we'll straighten this out.

35:06.772 --> 35:08.478
Chief wants to see you.

35:08.482 --> 35:09.983
See, that's what
I've been telling y'all.

35:09.984 --> 35:12.316
We're just gonna fire up the
peace pipe and figure this out.

35:12.319 --> 35:13.434
Okay?

35:25.374 --> 35:28.036
I need you to stay
on this side of the room

35:28.043 --> 35:30.455
and not talk to your son.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.794
You left your minor son
here unsupervised

35:36.802 --> 35:39.134
for how many hours?

35:39.138 --> 35:40.469
Three or four.

35:40.472 --> 35:42.758
He's 13 years old.
He's not a child.

35:44.351 --> 35:46.307
How long has your room
been in this state?

35:47.938 --> 35:50.725
I told him not
to let the maid in.

35:51.567 --> 35:54.684
Why didn't you want
your son to let the maid in?

36:00.993 --> 36:04.326
You'll need to come downtown
for a formal interview.

36:05.289 --> 36:06.779
A judge will then
make an initial ruling

36:06.790 --> 36:09.042
taking into account
Jack's statement,

36:09.043 --> 36:10.328
your statement,

36:10.336 --> 36:14.124
my report on health,
safety, living conditions.

36:14.131 --> 36:16.417
A ruling?

36:17.217 --> 36:20.300
On whether your son will remain
in your care, miss Linden.

36:23.724 --> 36:26.761
Mom, I got to go
to the bathroom.

36:29.730 --> 36:31.436
No.

36:33.984 --> 36:36.771
But I really got to go.

36:40.783 --> 36:42.648
Go on.

36:51.669 --> 36:56.789
Oh. I need to take this call.
I'll be... back in a second.

36:59.385 --> 37:01.717
This is Detective Linden.
What is it?

37:30.833 --> 37:32.915
You shouldn't
have done that, Jack.

37:34.753 --> 37:37.790
This isn't a good idea.
This is crazy.

37:44.012 --> 37:45.001
Jack?

37:45.013 --> 37:46.924
Get off of me!

37:49.393 --> 37:50.633
I'm sorry, Jack.
I'm sorry.

37:50.644 --> 37:54.136
Leave me alone!
Just leave me alone!

37:54.148 --> 37:55.308
Okay. I'm sorry.

37:55.315 --> 37:56.725
Leave me alone!

38:03.073 --> 38:05.189
I'm sorry, Jack.

38:10.247 --> 38:12.533
l'd first like to say

38:12.541 --> 38:15.874
my doctors have cleared me
to continue my campaign.

38:15.878 --> 38:17.539
I'll be leaving the hospital
tomorrow,

38:17.546 --> 38:20.208
and my health will not be
an issue going toward,

38:20.215 --> 38:23.332
although I may move
a bit more slowly.

38:24.136 --> 38:25.797
I know you have a lot
of questions,

38:25.804 --> 38:29.046
all of which I will, uh...
I will answer.

38:32.770 --> 38:36.809
But right now, my main concern

38:37.441 --> 38:41.730
is the unsolved murder
of Rosie Larsen.

38:41.737 --> 38:43.853
He's agreed to read
a statement.

38:45.824 --> 38:48.486
And I would like to thank
Stan Larsen

38:48.494 --> 38:50.075
for coming here tonight.

38:52.790 --> 38:55.577
This isn't about
what happened to me.

38:55.584 --> 39:01.545
This is about...
justice for a young girl

39:01.548 --> 39:04.039
and for a family
who still need answers.

39:04.051 --> 39:06.508
Mr. Larsen would like
to say a few words.

39:08.013 --> 39:10.880
Nearly three weeks ago,
my daughter, Rosie,

39:10.891 --> 39:13.724
was taken from us.

39:13.727 --> 39:16.844
Our loss has made us
realize how...

39:19.066 --> 39:22.524
How... how important
every day is together.

39:24.112 --> 39:27.400
This could have happened
to anybody...

39:32.496 --> 39:36.956
Rosie was my little girl.

39:36.959 --> 39:41.453
She was everything to me.

39:41.463 --> 39:45.001
But she means nothing
to you people.

39:45.008 --> 39:48.341
Rosie would be gone
and forgotten

39:48.345 --> 39:50.836
if you weren't using her
to sell papers

39:50.848 --> 39:53.214
or get people
to turn on the TV.

39:53.225 --> 39:58.060
She's not entertainment.
She's my daughter.

39:58.063 --> 39:59.394
None of you... none of you

39:59.398 --> 40:02.390
give a rat's ass about doing
what's right for her.

40:04.945 --> 40:08.654
I'm just like you, all of you
out there who are watching.

40:08.657 --> 40:11.148
I don't have much...
about $12,000.

40:11.159 --> 40:14.492
But the money's yours
if you find Rosie's killer

40:14.496 --> 40:16.953
or help the cops find
who killed my daughter.

40:16.957 --> 40:19.289
'Cause somebody's
gonna pay for this.

40:19.293 --> 40:24.128
Somebody's gonna pay for taking
my daughter away.

40:24.131 --> 40:25.211
That's all I got to say.

40:58.790 --> 41:01.623
Yo, Cochise, you missed it.

41:02.252 --> 41:04.584
Hey.

41:22.940 --> 41:24.180
Hey, Holder.

41:24.191 --> 41:26.352
I don't know where you are,
but you need to call me.

41:26.360 --> 41:27.475
There's something going on.

41:27.486 --> 41:31.445
I don't know what,
but just... just call me.

41:41.333 --> 41:43.369
Damn, now I know
what that guy meant

41:43.377 --> 41:45.368
when he said the casino
was business in the front

41:45.379 --> 41:47.461
and party in the back.

41:48.173 --> 41:50.164
You're very curious, detective.

41:50.175 --> 41:51.836
You and your partner
both like to go

41:51.843 --> 41:53.970
where you're not supposed to.

41:56.598 --> 41:58.884
Too bad for you, she already
got the warning.

41:59.851 --> 42:01.637
Yeah, that's more
than Rosie did.

42:01.645 --> 42:03.226
Aah!

42:03.230 --> 42:04.640
[ Groans ]

42:10.112 --> 42:12.569
Holder, where the hell
have you...

42:22.416 --> 42:24.907
Holder!
