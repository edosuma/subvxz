(Fredrik)
Oh, my goodness.

00:08.141 --> 00:10.310
- 3,100 foot, blended.
- It's a big price.

00:10.343 --> 00:11.778
For that really high price,
you know what I need?

00:11.811 --> 00:13.646
A scale model with lots
of beautiful renderings.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.915
We have a very different
philosophy on that.

00:15.949 --> 00:18.785
Have you looked into buying the
apartments in the entire floor?

00:18.818 --> 00:20.453
That means
this is a buyout.

00:20.487 --> 00:21.988
(Luis)
Buyouts are very difficult.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.456
The sellers have all the power.

00:23.490 --> 00:24.991
12 E, F,
the guy is never in town.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.494
I don't even know
if we could track him down.

00:27.527 --> 00:30.263
I must find
the owners of E and F.

00:30.296 --> 00:32.198
I got an interesting call
this weekend

00:32.232 --> 00:33.533
from this guy Michael,

00:33.566 --> 00:35.301
who lives
at 230 Central Park South.

00:35.335 --> 00:37.270
He's been approached
by Luis.

00:37.303 --> 00:39.839
- Ortiz?
- Yes.

00:39.873 --> 00:43.076
I feel that I'm being forced
out of the apartment.

00:43.109 --> 00:45.178
I'm gonna give Luis,
our friend, a call.

00:45.211 --> 00:46.780
I'm asking $10 million.

00:46.813 --> 00:48.214
You son of a bitch.

00:48.248 --> 00:50.083
I'd like us to take
the next step.

00:51.351 --> 00:52.585
We want to ask you

00:52.619 --> 00:56.790
if you would give
your eggs to us.

00:58.158 --> 01:00.393
No.
They're my eggs.

01:00.427 --> 01:01.895
I just cannot do it
right now.

01:01.928 --> 01:04.531
I'm really,
really sorry.

01:04.564 --> 01:06.900
We have been talking.

01:06.933 --> 01:11.571
We think that the three of us
should have a baby.

01:11.604 --> 01:13.640
Milla!

01:13.673 --> 01:15.675
Emilia,
will you marry me?

01:15.709 --> 01:16.676
Yes.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.945
Oh, my God!
[laughing]

01:18.978 --> 01:20.447
They want me to move
to Geneva,

01:20.480 --> 01:21.915
like, full-time.

01:21.948 --> 01:23.149
I can't leave New York.

01:23.183 --> 01:26.219
You have only one spoon,
one plate.

01:26.252 --> 01:27.520
You don't have nothing.

01:27.554 --> 01:29.289
- I'm always working.
- I don't like that.

01:29.322 --> 01:30.323
(Luis)
I was sitting with a client,

01:30.357 --> 01:32.926
and I had a panic attack.

01:32.959 --> 01:35.929
Close your eyes
and just breathe.

01:35.962 --> 01:38.098
They will absolutely do
$11 million.

01:38.131 --> 01:39.099
And we have a deal.

01:39.132 --> 01:40.100
You really delivered here.

01:40.133 --> 01:41.134
Let's get it done.

01:48.775 --> 01:49.976
Motherf***er!

01:50.010 --> 01:52.746
Oh, Jesus.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.381

My motto is expansion...

01:59.652 --> 02:02.655
always in all ways.

(Luis)
New York City--

02:03.890 --> 02:06.059
it's the most exciting city
for real estate,

02:06.092 --> 02:07.093
and that's why I'm here.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.261
(Fredrik)
I'm the closer

02:08.294 --> 02:09.662
and a listing machine.

02:09.696 --> 02:12.098
What makes me better is that
I work harder than anyone else.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.266
Whee!

02:13.299 --> 02:15.368
We're friends now,
right?

02:15.402 --> 02:17.404
I don't need him,
and you don't either.

02:17.437 --> 02:19.172
This will never end.

[keys clacking]

02:32.085 --> 02:33.319
Everyone have a minute?

02:33.353 --> 02:35.689
514 Broome Street.

02:35.722 --> 02:37.557
We were on the market
for $10 million,

02:37.590 --> 02:39.926
and we went to contract
at $11 million,

02:39.959 --> 02:41.728
which is awesome.

02:41.761 --> 02:44.330
And then the buyer
went to jail.

02:44.364 --> 02:46.266
So what I convinced
the owner to do

02:46.299 --> 02:48.568
was to send us
his entire contact list.

02:48.601 --> 02:52.172
I wasn't gonna give Roger the
satisfaction of just firing me.

02:52.205 --> 02:55.842
You don't just lay down.
You fight. You persevere.

02:55.875 --> 02:57.310
That's what
Jean-Claude Van Damme did,

02:57.344 --> 02:58.678
and that's what he taught me.

02:58.712 --> 03:01.548
I really do think
that the buyer for this house

03:01.581 --> 03:04.150
is gonna be someone
in your personal network.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.053
My gut is telling me
that one of those people

03:07.053 --> 03:09.689
will have Roger's same likes
and sensibilities

03:09.723 --> 03:13.059
and will connect in the same way
on this house,

03:13.059 --> 03:14.761
and I am going to sell it
to them.

03:14.794 --> 03:17.597
I want you to hand over
your entire Rolodex to me,

03:17.630 --> 03:20.100
and I'm going to reach out
personally

03:20.133 --> 03:22.068
to everybody
that you've ever met,

03:22.102 --> 03:24.070
and I just know it in the core

03:24.104 --> 03:26.072
that one of these people
will be the buyer.

03:30.276 --> 03:32.078
Okay?

03:32.112 --> 03:36.783
There's at least 22,000 names
and phone numbers in here.

03:36.816 --> 03:38.084
So what I want to do

03:38.084 --> 03:39.886
is I'm gonna break this up
into everybody,

03:39.919 --> 03:41.488
and we're gonna call
every single person

03:41.521 --> 03:42.789
that he has ever known.

03:42.822 --> 03:44.657
There you go.

03:44.691 --> 03:45.759
Thank you.

03:45.792 --> 03:46.926
Does anyone have
any questions?

03:46.960 --> 03:47.994
(woman)
No.

03:48.094 --> 03:49.929
Whoever gets the buyer
gets the deal,

03:49.963 --> 03:51.264
and that's how it works.

03:51.297 --> 03:53.099
And pick up your phones.
Let's do it.

03:53.099 --> 03:54.934
Brad Mohr,
I'm calling from Nest Seekers.

03:54.968 --> 03:59.272
I am calling on behalf
of Roger Stein's townhouse.

03:59.305 --> 04:00.306
Do you remember him?

04:02.876 --> 04:05.045
Okay, I'm sorry.
Not your friend.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.513
I will not call you again.

04:06.546 --> 04:09.049
- Those are the best ones.
- Oh, he did not like him.

04:09.049 --> 04:12.085
How's everyone doing out there?
Any leads?

04:12.118 --> 04:13.687
A lot of hang-ups?

04:13.720 --> 04:17.757
Roger hasn't deleted people
that, like, he doesn't talk to

04:17.791 --> 04:19.426
and he shouldn't talk to.

04:19.459 --> 04:20.927
Keep calling.

04:20.960 --> 04:22.395
We're not leaving here until
we call every single person

04:22.429 --> 04:24.497
he's ever known.

04:24.531 --> 04:25.632
Hey, Eric.

04:25.665 --> 04:28.768
I was given your information
by Roger Stein.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.605
He has a townhouse in SoHo.

04:32.639 --> 04:34.507
I'd love to send the details
over to you.

04:34.541 --> 04:35.675
I would love
to show it to you.

04:35.709 --> 04:36.810
What's your email address?

04:39.212 --> 04:41.247
- Sure.
- Thank you, Peter.

04:42.782 --> 04:43.783
Thanks, Eric.

04:56.996 --> 04:59.099

One's a developer.

04:59.132 --> 05:02.035
If I do find the buyer
through Roger's contact list,

05:02.035 --> 05:04.871
by putting in that work,
by working my team,

05:04.904 --> 05:08.241
and by sourcing, literally,
a needle in a haystack,

05:08.274 --> 05:11.945
that shows why you pay brokers
commissions--

05:12.045 --> 05:13.713
Good brokers, me.

Hi.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.135
- What a gorgeous showroom.
- Thank you.

05:36.636 --> 05:39.305
I think this is gonna be so good
for my buyers at 290 West

05:39.339 --> 05:42.876
to finally touch and feel
and see the kitchens.

05:42.909 --> 05:44.778
(Fredrik)
It's been a few days
since my boat party

05:44.811 --> 05:46.880
for my new development,
290 West.

05:46.913 --> 05:48.381
Zach!

05:48.415 --> 05:50.450
When it's done and you see
all that glass and the water...

05:50.483 --> 05:52.419
The entire roof
with a swimming pool.

05:52.452 --> 05:55.088
Kitchens are all open,
all glass.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.757
The party created
a lot of excitement.

05:57.791 --> 06:00.326
In fact, I've been talking
to specific people

06:00.360 --> 06:02.228
about specific units.

06:02.262 --> 06:03.730
I heard you flew
from Mexico

06:03.763 --> 06:05.532
to buy new construction
in Manhattan.

06:05.565 --> 06:06.533
Yes.

06:06.566 --> 06:08.902
I think the penthouse
is good for you.

06:08.935 --> 06:11.404
So, in my efforts
to steer people away

06:11.438 --> 06:13.406
from the dirty
construction site...

06:13.440 --> 06:14.407
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:14.441 --> 06:15.542
Oh, hi!

06:15.575 --> 06:19.946
I am continuing
my off-site sales strategy.

06:20.046 --> 06:23.049
(Lee)
This is some
beautiful cabinetry.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.050
No handle.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.819
No handle on all
of the lower cabinets.

06:25.852 --> 06:27.654
- Try it. Try it.
- How do you open it?

06:27.687 --> 06:29.489
(Fredrik)
Close your eyes
and pretend that you live here.

06:29.522 --> 06:31.458
You own a 290 West.

06:31.491 --> 06:33.626
Zach didn't provide
a sales gallery for me,

06:33.660 --> 06:36.129
so I, instead, started
reaching out to the people

06:36.162 --> 06:38.531
that are supplying the finishes
of the building.

06:38.565 --> 06:41.067
And then the countertop is gonna
be exchanged to a marble.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.602
(Lee)
Correct.

06:42.635 --> 06:44.170
Since the apartments
aren't finished yet,

06:44.204 --> 06:47.107
this is a great way of bringing
the renderings to life.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.275
Lot of times, you know,
we wear nail polish,

06:49.309 --> 06:50.543
and we put our hands here,

06:50.577 --> 06:53.113
and nail polish
gets on the cabinet.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.314
Is there a way
we can maybe have, like,

06:54.347 --> 06:55.382
a little handle
that we can pull out?

06:55.415 --> 06:56.783
Absolutely.

06:56.816 --> 06:58.785
One of the reasons we picked
this particular manufacturer

06:58.818 --> 07:01.354
is that you have an option
to upgrade or change.

07:01.388 --> 07:05.492
For anyone
with really long claws...

07:05.525 --> 07:07.827
we can add in a tiny,
little handle.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.496
Are you saying I have
long claws, Fredrik?

07:09.529 --> 07:12.332
No, no, no! I didn't say that.
I said just if you--

07:12.365 --> 07:14.701
We don't want you
to break any nails.

07:14.734 --> 07:16.069
This is the fridge.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.537
(Esther)
Oh, that's a fridge.

07:17.570 --> 07:18.872
- Yep.
- I thought it was a cabinet.

07:18.905 --> 07:20.340
That's great.

07:20.373 --> 07:23.176
(Fredrik)
It's all about the clean,
modern look.

07:23.209 --> 07:25.111
It's phenomenal.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.480
Selling new construction
without a sales gallery,

07:27.514 --> 07:29.382
that's a major undertaking.

07:29.416 --> 07:32.519
But thinking of $3 million
in commission,

07:32.552 --> 07:34.120
I think I'm motivated.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.056
Beautiful views,
really high ceilings,

07:36.056 --> 07:37.424
amazing kitchens.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.925
That you can customize.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.794

- I like it.

I have some other business
to attend to.

- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

Do you live here?

08:21.468 --> 08:23.136
No.
Does it look like I do?

There's a lot of alcohol,
so I don't know.

It's good to see you.

08:37.083 --> 08:38.051
What about it?

08:38.084 --> 08:40.920
So I've got
this listing there.

08:44.591 --> 08:48.228
And I'm asking $10 million.

08:48.261 --> 08:50.430
I know for a fact that
$10 million is not the number

08:50.463 --> 08:51.698
that you have in mind.

08:51.731 --> 08:54.167
Pretty much trying
to f*** with me.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.435
That is delusional,

08:55.468 --> 08:57.671
and the fact that you actually
stand by that number

to create one big luxury home.

09:08.148 --> 09:11.451
Without my client's unit...

09:11.484 --> 09:14.020
they can't do that.

09:14.054 --> 09:17.724
$10 million?

09:17.757 --> 09:19.292
That really is your number?

09:19.325 --> 09:23.196
It's only, like,
$6,200 a foot.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.565
Doesn't sound terrible.

09:25.598 --> 09:30.036

worth $1.5 million.

09:32.339 --> 09:35.041

09:35.075 --> 09:37.911
probably some 80 feet
or so.

09:37.944 --> 09:39.479
And then if that
weren't enough,

09:39.512 --> 09:40.914
there's a double whammy.

09:40.947 --> 09:44.317
A second one
right across the street.

09:44.351 --> 09:45.385
(Luis)
He's going to have

09:45.418 --> 09:47.087
the darkest apartment
on planet Earth.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.389
Right now he has
a very good opportunity

09:49.422 --> 09:51.691
to walk away
with $1.5 million.

09:51.725 --> 09:54.761
So that's your offer,
is 1.5 million?

09:54.794 --> 09:56.796
Yes.

09:59.466 --> 10:00.867
(Ryan)
The last time a two-bedroom

10:00.900 --> 10:03.903
on Central Park South
was worth $1.5 million,

10:03.937 --> 10:06.473
Luis was still in diapers.

10:06.506 --> 10:08.608
And I was three.

10:08.641 --> 10:10.310
The total square footage
is what?

10:10.343 --> 10:11.511
Of everything
that he wants to do?

10:11.544 --> 10:13.279
5,000 feet.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.348
What do you think we could ask
for that apartment?

10:15.382 --> 10:17.584
$25 million.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.919
Michael has got
about 1,600 square feet

10:19.953 --> 10:22.322
of the 5,000 square feet.

10:22.355 --> 10:27.027
* *

10:27.060 --> 10:28.762
Give me a counter.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.700
I think for that apartment,

10:33.733 --> 10:36.102
based on what
Ian is trying to do,

10:36.136 --> 10:37.637
that $7 million...

10:37.671 --> 10:38.938
[laughs]

10:38.972 --> 10:39.939
Is a solid number.

10:39.973 --> 10:40.974
Why are you laughing?

10:41.007 --> 10:43.810
You are clearly lost

10:43.843 --> 10:45.845
in some...

10:45.879 --> 10:47.781
fairy tale.

10:47.814 --> 10:51.051
I will give you
$1.750 million.

10:51.084 --> 10:55.488
That is $250,000 over
what that apartment is worth.

10:55.522 --> 10:58.925
What is this?

10:58.958 --> 11:01.194
[mouth full]
Oh, my God.
It's avocado in there.

11:03.463 --> 11:06.066
We're prepared to give him
something,

11:06.099 --> 11:08.568
but how can I even give you
a number, a real number,

11:08.601 --> 11:12.972
when you're in f***ing
planet Jupiter?

11:13.073 --> 11:14.074
All right, good.

11:14.074 --> 11:18.411
Listen, Santa Claus,
to get him to move...

11:18.445 --> 11:21.381
the bottom line
that he has given me

11:21.414 --> 11:23.616
is $5 million.

11:23.650 --> 11:25.819
You are full of sh**.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.987
(Ryan)
With Michael's unit,

11:28.088 --> 11:29.556
full-floor apartment.

11:29.589 --> 11:31.124
Without Michael's unit,

11:31.157 --> 11:33.093
no full-floor apartment.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.461
- Okay.
- Listen--

11:34.494 --> 11:35.462
Sit down. Sit down.
Sit down.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.564
Let me talk to you
for a second.

11:37.597 --> 11:39.099
We're almost the same height
level when you stand,

11:39.132 --> 11:40.233
so sit down
for one second.

11:40.266 --> 11:44.437
Don't touch me, bro.

11:44.471 --> 11:47.607
$5 million
gets the deal done.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.309
I'm gonna give you $2 million,

11:49.342 --> 11:50.744
and that's as much
as I'm going to go.

11:50.777 --> 11:53.780
I--
[exhales deeply]

11:53.813 --> 11:55.115
I got all the time
in the world.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.316
Oh, I'm sure you do,

11:56.349 --> 11:57.650
because this is the only deal
you're working on.

11:57.684 --> 12:00.887
Because I care about it.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.722
How can we make
this deal work?

12:02.756 --> 12:04.591
Tell me a real number.

12:04.624 --> 12:06.559
To come from $10 million
to $7 million to $5 million,

12:06.593 --> 12:08.728
you're starting at outrageous,

12:08.762 --> 12:11.231
and now you're ending
at ridiculous.

12:11.264 --> 12:14.067
This is not
how you negotiate,<i>papi.</i>

12:14.067 --> 12:17.070
I'm gonna go to the bathroom,
and I want a f***ing response.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.539

Please wash your hands.

12:20.774 --> 12:22.342

12:23.443 --> 12:27.747
We have reached
50% sold at 290 West.

12:27.781 --> 12:28.782
50%!

12:28.815 --> 12:29.916
That pays the bank back.

12:29.949 --> 12:31.418
You got to be f***ing
kidding me.

12:31.451 --> 12:34.688
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

[dramatic music]

12:41.594 --> 12:48.301

12:48.335 --> 12:51.438
(Luis)
Do we have a deal,
or do we have a deal?

12:55.709 --> 13:00.046
$4 million,
and that's it.

13:00.046 --> 13:01.915
I think we're
getting somewhere.

13:01.948 --> 13:06.119
No bullsh**.
$4 million.

13:06.152 --> 13:08.321
I'll give you
$2 1/2 million.

13:11.491 --> 13:14.060
Tell him we've maxed out
at $2.5 million.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.396
Okay.
I'll tell him.

13:16.429 --> 13:20.100
"Maxed out at $2.5 million."

13:21.801 --> 13:23.670
Now we wait.

[tense music]

13:26.706 --> 13:33.813
* *

13:33.847 --> 13:36.116
You agree that $2.5 million
is a good deal.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.317
[cell phone chimes]

13:41.788 --> 13:44.190
"$4 million,
my bottom.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.559
They don't want it,
leave."

13:49.996 --> 13:51.364
(Luis)
Ian doesn't want to spend

13:51.398 --> 13:54.467
more than $6 million for
the remaining of the apartments.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.103
We've already spent half of that
in 12-D.

13:57.103 --> 13:59.506
Contract's out.
Love it.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.174
Which means I only have
$3 million left.

14:01.207 --> 14:03.410
I cannot spend more than that

14:03.443 --> 14:05.545
on Ryan's apartment.

14:05.578 --> 14:08.882
I'm not doing a deal
for more than $2 1/2 million.

14:14.054 --> 14:16.956
We're done.

Congratulations.

Thanks for the avocado.

Hi, Jordan.

14:33.973 --> 14:37.477
I'm on my way to Zach's
apartment for an update on 290.

14:37.510 --> 14:41.648
Just want to make sure that
that last B-line got signed.

14:41.681 --> 14:45.318
And that penthouse A
at $12,750,000 is signed, right?

14:48.121 --> 14:49.222
Amazing.

14:49.255 --> 14:51.324
I think it's fair to say
at this point

14:51.358 --> 14:54.761
that I definitely know
how to rock the boat.

14:54.794 --> 14:58.164
We think that the three of us
should have a baby.

14:58.198 --> 15:01.034
Not only did I come back ashore
with the greatest gift

15:01.067 --> 15:02.302
of my entire life,

15:02.335 --> 15:05.739
but I also got not only one,
not two, not three--

15:05.772 --> 15:07.774
four offers,

15:07.807 --> 15:10.110
including one
of the penthouses.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.345
I'm home.

15:12.379 --> 15:13.613
Oh, good to see you.

15:13.646 --> 15:16.216
And once I started taking people
to the kitchen showroom,

15:16.249 --> 15:17.384
two more sold.

15:23.289 --> 15:26.559
The big news,
as of this morning,

15:26.593 --> 15:32.265
I accepted $12,750,000
full ask

15:32.298 --> 15:33.667
on penthouse A.

15:35.201 --> 15:38.471
We have reached 50% sold
at 290 West.

15:40.507 --> 15:41.641
Whee!

15:44.911 --> 15:46.579
What are the terms
of the contract?

15:46.613 --> 15:48.181
Full ask, they're paying
all closing costs.

15:48.214 --> 15:49.416
Transfer tax?

15:49.449 --> 15:50.450
- Everything.
- Everything?

15:50.483 --> 15:52.686
Everything on them.

15:55.255 --> 15:56.823
Okay.

15:56.856 --> 16:00.060
That's your reaction--
"Okay"?

16:00.093 --> 16:01.461
"Okay"?

16:01.494 --> 16:05.365
I mean, I just sold out half the
building with hardly any tools.

16:05.398 --> 16:08.068
We only been on the market for
a little bit of time and 50%.

16:08.101 --> 16:10.036
That pays the bank back.

16:10.036 --> 16:11.404
"The bank, the bank,
the bank."

16:11.438 --> 16:12.539
I mean, come on, please.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.274
I sold half the building
in just a few weeks.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.308
And you know what?

16:15.342 --> 16:17.577
$3,100 per square foot
blended average

16:17.610 --> 16:19.679
was exactly
what I promised.

16:19.713 --> 16:23.483
I mean, we're setting records,
if I might add.

16:23.516 --> 16:27.220
Now, I've come to you
with one request.

16:31.925 --> 16:35.295
We want you to be...

16:35.328 --> 16:38.898
godfather for Milla.

16:38.932 --> 16:40.333
Really?

16:40.367 --> 16:43.303
Seeing that Lynn gave her eggs
and good news to us

16:43.336 --> 16:46.072
at the party I threw for Zach
at 290 West,

16:46.072 --> 16:49.476
Derek and I started talking
about our little project.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.678
That's the best thing
I heard.

16:51.711 --> 16:54.814
Finally, a reaction
from Zach Vella.

16:54.848 --> 16:55.815
This is amazing.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.650
Zach, the godfather.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.353
Zach and I have been working
together now for five years.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.022
I mean,
that's a dozen projects,

17:02.055 --> 17:04.557
and as much as we disagree
sometimes in business

17:04.591 --> 17:06.526
and we don't see
eye to eye always,

17:06.559 --> 17:08.461
we've become
really good friends.

17:08.495 --> 17:11.031
Zach and his business partner
were the only two developers

17:11.031 --> 17:12.532
that were invited
to my wedding.

17:12.565 --> 17:15.402
I'm honored, and I couldn't
imagine anything better.

17:15.435 --> 17:18.738
I'm happy for you guys,
and that was a huge surprise.

17:18.772 --> 17:19.739
Thank you.

17:19.773 --> 17:21.408
What's the timeline here?

17:21.441 --> 17:22.409
Last time I checked,

17:22.442 --> 17:24.144
it's nine months
you have to wait.

17:24.177 --> 17:25.578
Since Derek
and I have been waiting

17:25.612 --> 17:27.247
such a long time for this,

17:27.280 --> 17:29.049
we don't want to waste
any more time.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.216
We have to celebrate
a little here.

17:31.251 --> 17:32.619
Ooh.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.621
So we want to start the process,
actually, immediately with Lynn.

17:34.654 --> 17:37.057
And we're already looking
for a surrogate.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.692
It is really happening.

- Cheers. Cheers.
- Whee!

Remember the coffee?

17:53.340 --> 17:54.341
Oh.

17:57.711 --> 17:59.746
Just hang here.

As long as Central Park South
remains at a stalemate,

18:02.716 --> 18:05.452
it's time for me to put
another listing to bed

18:05.485 --> 18:08.355
once and for all.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.789
- Ryan.
- Hey.

18:09.823 --> 18:11.358
- How are you?
- Your favorite broker.

18:11.391 --> 18:12.692
I guess we'll see
about that.

18:12.726 --> 18:15.095
I'm pretty sure it was a mix
of groveling

18:15.128 --> 18:18.665
and chutzpah that got me
a second chance with Roger.

18:18.698 --> 18:22.035
I am certain
there will not be a third.

18:22.035 --> 18:24.304
So...

18:24.337 --> 18:26.306
thank you for giving us
your contact list.

18:26.339 --> 18:27.640
I have a lot
of interesting people.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.909
I'm sure.

18:29.943 --> 18:33.346
It worked.

This guy Seth--
tennis player.

18:36.216 --> 18:40.053
Like, 30 years ago, you used to
play doubles with this guy

18:40.053 --> 18:41.054
at a club.

18:41.087 --> 18:42.455
We were good friends.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.657
- He was actually a great guy.
- He's super interested.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.693
Actually, in the city,
and ironically enough,

18:46.726 --> 18:48.661
is looking for a place.

18:48.695 --> 18:52.232
And he offered
7 million bucks.

18:52.265 --> 18:54.434
- $7 million?
- Yes.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.503
You got to be f***ing
kidding me, Ryan.

18:56.536 --> 18:59.439
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.241
You had $11 million--
$11 million.

19:01.274 --> 19:04.044
You come in here
and bring me $7 million?

19:04.077 --> 19:06.146
It's like that scene
in<i>Desperado</i>

19:06.179 --> 19:07.480
with Antonio Banderas,

19:07.514 --> 19:10.283
and he whips out the guns
out of his guitar cases.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.285
That's what's happening
in front of me.

19:12.318 --> 19:15.789
So you don't like $7 million?
That's what you're saying?

19:15.822 --> 19:17.791
Hopefully, we can still retain
our friendship

19:17.824 --> 19:20.326
after you sign
the other contract

19:20.360 --> 19:22.028
that I'm bringing you
from your other friend,

19:22.028 --> 19:24.497
a guy named Jay,

19:24.531 --> 19:26.900
who's at the table
with $10 million.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.871
And this is a guy
that's not incarcerated?

19:31.905 --> 19:34.174
Not yet,
but he's one of your friends,

19:34.207 --> 19:36.643
and if he acts the way
you do in public around people,

19:36.676 --> 19:38.144
he could go to jail tomorrow.

19:38.178 --> 19:39.746
[laughs]

19:39.779 --> 19:41.448
But he's gonna give you
$10 million for your house,

19:41.481 --> 19:43.283
and I want to lock it up now.

19:43.316 --> 19:47.220

19:47.253 --> 19:50.523
Take the $10 million.

19:50.557 --> 19:54.527

19:54.561 --> 19:56.796
Let's do it.

19:56.830 --> 19:59.366
This is why I have
premature gray hair, man.

19:59.399 --> 20:02.068
- I thought you dyed it gray.
- No, I don't dye it gray!

20:02.102 --> 20:04.004
- [laughs]
- It's 'cause people like you.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.372
You stress me the f*** out.

20:05.405 --> 20:08.108
Not only did I not lose
this deal,

20:08.141 --> 20:11.544
I procured the buyer directly
out of thin air.

20:11.578 --> 20:14.881
We're gonna call every single
person that he has ever known.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.017
He isn't represented
by another agent,

20:17.050 --> 20:21.321
and that means I just scored
a double commission.

20:22.922 --> 20:27.360
$600,000 for me.

20:27.394 --> 20:28.361
How good is that?

20:28.395 --> 20:30.830
Wow.

20:30.864 --> 20:33.233
How expensive is that?

20:33.266 --> 20:34.734
That's not coming
out of my commission,

20:34.768 --> 20:36.002
just so you know.

20:36.770 --> 20:38.204
$4 million is ridiculous.

20:38.238 --> 20:41.174
That destroys
the whole mission.

Ian.

20:56.089 --> 20:57.357
Hey, Ricky.
How are you?

20:57.390 --> 20:59.526
- How are you? Very well.
- What's been going on?

20:59.559 --> 21:02.696
The negotiation with Ryan
was a straight-up fiasco.

21:02.729 --> 21:04.264
We're prepared
to give him something,

21:04.297 --> 21:06.332
but how can I even give you
a real number

21:06.366 --> 21:10.370
when you're in f***ing
planet Jupiter?

21:10.403 --> 21:13.606
Ryan was just wasting my time.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.642
We did the best we could.

21:15.675 --> 21:16.876
What's the problem?

21:16.910 --> 21:18.378
Originally, he came in
with $10 million,

21:18.411 --> 21:19.746
which is
obviously ridiculous.

21:19.779 --> 21:23.717
But then he came down
to $4 million.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.586
$4 million is ridiculous.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.988
At $4 million,
there is zero margin for me.

21:29.089 --> 21:29.989
I understand that.

21:30.090 --> 21:32.158
That destroys
the whole mission.

21:32.192 --> 21:34.361
I already spent $3 million
on 12-D.

21:34.394 --> 21:37.230
Even though it's a much smaller
apartment than Ryan's,

21:37.263 --> 21:38.765
it has park views

21:38.798 --> 21:41.001
which makes it worth
much more.

21:41.101 --> 21:43.703
I don't have $4 million
to spend.

21:43.737 --> 21:45.005
The whole mission impossible

21:45.105 --> 21:46.473
is now impossible
at $4 million.

21:46.506 --> 21:47.574
Yes, yes, yes.

21:47.607 --> 21:48.908
Don't bring me
a $4 million offer.

21:48.942 --> 21:50.577
That's useless. I could have
went and paid the guy

21:50.610 --> 21:52.145
a lot less than that
and got this myself.

21:52.178 --> 21:53.646
One second, one second,
one second.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.415
Listen to me.
It's not even the $4 million.

21:55.448 --> 21:57.851
It's the fact that they think
that we need them

21:57.884 --> 21:59.019
in order to move along.

21:59.119 --> 22:00.353
That's a traditional
hold-out mentality.

22:00.387 --> 22:01.855
100%.

22:01.888 --> 22:03.723
What did you proposed to them,
and what have they offered you?

22:03.757 --> 22:05.325
I went all the way up
to 2.5 million.

22:05.358 --> 22:06.693
Ricky...

22:06.726 --> 22:10.230
I want those units.

22:10.263 --> 22:12.532
I want those apartments

22:12.565 --> 22:14.768
the same way you do.

22:14.801 --> 22:17.070
Ryan will not come down
from $4 million

22:17.070 --> 22:18.905
because he doesn't want to show
his client

22:18.938 --> 22:20.640
that his strategy
was a disaster.

22:20.674 --> 22:22.442
But...

22:22.475 --> 22:26.279
I'm gonna help Ryan
save his reputation.

22:26.312 --> 22:30.817
The strategy is for us
to market what we have.

22:30.850 --> 22:34.187
Let's do the biggest party
the world has ever seen.

22:34.220 --> 22:35.355
It's not even
for the people

22:35.388 --> 22:36.756
that are gonna come
to this event.

22:36.790 --> 22:38.558
It's for Ryan and Michael

22:38.591 --> 22:41.394
to know that we're
moving forward without them.

22:41.428 --> 22:43.096
Once they realize
that we're moving forward,

22:43.129 --> 22:45.965
that apartment goes back
to its current value,

22:45.999 --> 22:48.134
and Michael's going
to blame Ryan

22:48.168 --> 22:49.502
for not being able
to deliver,

22:49.536 --> 22:51.371
and he's gonna blame himself
for even hiring a broker

22:51.404 --> 22:53.873
to try to do something
that did not work.

22:53.907 --> 22:56.142
That's my plan.

22:56.176 --> 22:58.578
If we're not able
to get the entire floor

22:58.611 --> 23:00.447
and have the elevator open
directly into the unit,

23:00.480 --> 23:03.683
this is not
a $25 million apartment.

23:03.717 --> 23:06.052
In fact, this is not even
a $20 million apartment.

23:06.052 --> 23:08.321
[dramatic music]

23:08.355 --> 23:09.956

out of this apartment,

and get them back to the table.

23:12.459 --> 23:13.426
Let's do it.

23:13.460 --> 23:14.427
Yes.

I'm going to make sure

23:16.696 --> 23:19.065
that the first invitation that
Ronita sends about this party

23:19.065 --> 23:22.435
is addressed specifically
to Ryan Serhant.

23:22.469 --> 23:23.636
But let me warn you--

23:23.670 --> 23:25.271
failure in this situation
is not an option.

23:25.305 --> 23:27.140
Failure is not an option
for me either.

23:27.173 --> 23:28.208
- Okay, good.
- So we will do this.

23:28.241 --> 23:29.242
- It's a good strategy.
- All right.

23:29.275 --> 23:30.910

- Ricky.

I, um...

I don't think you'd believe me
if I told you

23:54.534 --> 23:57.470
what the negotiation was like.

23:57.504 --> 23:59.873
We were in a--
basically, in a vault...

No.

That's why you hired me.

I do.
I--

I take back
that I'm tired.

24:15.321 --> 24:19.726
I'm standing firm at
$4 million for your apartment,

24:19.759 --> 24:23.329
and they are stuck, stuck,
stuck, stuck, stuck

24:23.363 --> 24:24.898
at $2 1/2 million.

24:28.168 --> 24:29.736
A little bit.

It's a little tricky
because he believes so strongly

$1 1/2 million,

I'm almost done.

28:58.972 --> 29:00.507
Now it's getting muddy.

29:00.540 --> 29:01.708
What did I say?

29:01.741 --> 29:04.177
- You said that.
- You didn't listen to me.

29:04.210 --> 29:06.212
[classical musical flourish]

[light rock music]

29:12.285 --> 29:18.191

29:18.224 --> 29:20.326
(Fredrik)
So come here to the left.

29:20.360 --> 29:22.729
[light harp music]

29:22.762 --> 29:24.197
This is the hallway.

29:25.065 --> 29:27.767
[chuckling]

29:27.801 --> 29:29.569
This is the--
Wait. Open the door, babe.

29:29.602 --> 29:31.037
Open the door.

29:31.037 --> 29:32.439
[chuckling]

29:32.472 --> 29:33.673
Oh, it's so heavy.

29:33.707 --> 29:38.645
* *

29:43.049 --> 29:44.484
(Fredrik)
Derek just flew in from London

29:44.517 --> 29:46.286
where he was visiting
his parents.

29:46.319 --> 29:47.954
And for the very first time,

29:48.054 --> 29:50.390
he's seeing our new home.

29:50.423 --> 29:53.493
* *

29:53.526 --> 29:55.395
(Fredrik)
I've had so many
amazing memories here,

29:55.428 --> 29:57.630
like, little Mousey
over there,

29:57.664 --> 30:00.834
Fritzy begging for food
in the kitchen,

30:00.867 --> 30:04.204
Derek sitting naked,
reading a book.

30:04.237 --> 30:06.439
Derek and I have actually
been talking for a while now

30:06.473 --> 30:08.308
about putting our place
on the market.

30:08.341 --> 30:10.276
Out with the old,
in with the new.

30:10.310 --> 30:12.245
And with Milla coming,

30:12.278 --> 30:14.681
it was the perfect time
to start fresh

30:14.714 --> 30:18.151
and find a new place
where we're gonna grow a family.

30:18.184 --> 30:20.854
This is the bedroom,
right here.

30:20.887 --> 30:22.222
If you wake up--

30:22.255 --> 30:25.291
And that's all gla--
That's one piece of glass.

30:25.325 --> 30:28.294
- You like it?
- Incredible. I love it.

30:28.328 --> 30:33.533
* *

30:33.566 --> 30:36.603
Derek and I
are now proud owners

30:36.636 --> 30:40.674
of a huge three-bedroom loft
facing the river at 290 West.

30:40.707 --> 30:43.476
[upbeat music]

30:43.510 --> 30:44.811
And Milla, you know what?

30:44.844 --> 30:47.747
She's gonna be able to watch
Hudson River sunset

30:47.781 --> 30:49.449
from her crib.

30:49.482 --> 30:52.485
[chuckles]

30:56.389 --> 30:58.925
You know how hard I worked
to get here.

30:58.958 --> 31:02.962
I mean, to travel all the way
to New York, to begin with,

31:03.063 --> 31:06.166
and then to search
the whole world to find you

31:06.199 --> 31:10.270
and then to be able for us
to have an apartment like this.

31:16.609 --> 31:18.178
My wish is just that

31:18.211 --> 31:22.082
I want us to be as strong
together as possible.

31:22.115 --> 31:26.619
You know, I think we really need
to be tight as parents.

31:26.653 --> 31:28.555
I think having a big house
is great,

31:28.588 --> 31:30.090
and all these other things
are great,

31:30.090 --> 31:32.092
but I think this
is more important,

31:32.092 --> 31:33.326
like, us being strong.

31:33.360 --> 31:34.561
I agree with you.

31:34.594 --> 31:36.396
As long as you and I
are together,

31:36.429 --> 31:37.564
it doesn't really matter
where we are.

31:37.597 --> 31:38.665
I mean, that's why
I like the idea

31:38.698 --> 31:40.100
of doing this
in a construction site,

31:40.100 --> 31:41.234
'cause here we are.

31:41.267 --> 31:43.903
There's no kitchen,
no walls, no glass.

31:43.937 --> 31:45.872
Just dusty concrete,
and look at us,

31:45.905 --> 31:48.108
having a romantic--

31:48.108 --> 31:49.943
romantic moment.

31:49.976 --> 31:52.012
(Fredrik)
I've always wanted a family.

31:52.112 --> 31:54.781
I was alone for so many years,
working so hard.

31:54.814 --> 31:57.217
So now we're gonna be
this little unit.

31:57.250 --> 31:59.719
This little solar system.

31:59.753 --> 32:02.922
What more can I ask for?

32:02.956 --> 32:05.492
(Fredrik)
I'll never get sick
of this view.

32:05.525 --> 32:07.527
This view.

32:07.560 --> 32:08.528
[chuckles]

32:08.561 --> 32:10.063
I will never
get sick of it.

32:10.063 --> 32:11.698
[Derek laughs]

32:29.516 --> 32:34.587

32:34.621 --> 32:36.623
- Did you see the floor plan?
- Yeah.

32:36.656 --> 32:38.491
I mean, you can basically have
three little floors.

32:38.525 --> 32:39.492
Excuse me one second.

32:39.526 --> 32:40.727
Where's--
where's Ryan?

32:40.760 --> 32:42.662
He's gonna show up.
He RSVP'd.

32:42.696 --> 32:43.930
He's gonna show up.

32:43.963 --> 32:46.099
* *

32:46.099 --> 32:48.635
Ian had to jump on a plane
very last minute to Europe

32:48.668 --> 32:50.136
this afternoon,

32:50.170 --> 32:54.007
and I'm expecting to give him
good news by the time he lands.

32:54.107 --> 32:56.242
He's gonna show up.

32:56.276 --> 32:57.744
But if Ryan doesn't show up,

32:57.777 --> 32:59.546
I'm gonna have to throw
this phone

32:59.579 --> 33:01.948
outside these
$25 million windows.

33:02.048 --> 33:06.219
* *

33:06.252 --> 33:07.887
Thanks.

33:11.224 --> 33:12.359
Um...
I will--

33:12.392 --> 33:13.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
100%.

33:13.693 --> 33:16.563
I'm sorry.
I'm distracted.

33:16.596 --> 33:18.064
(woman)
I have to tell you...

33:21.434 --> 33:24.270
Thank you very much.

33:24.304 --> 33:25.872
Can you guys give me one second,
please?

33:25.905 --> 33:27.841
Sure.

33:27.874 --> 33:29.142
Finally.

33:29.175 --> 33:32.645
[upbeat dance music]

33:32.679 --> 33:35.281
Now let's put on a show.

33:35.315 --> 33:37.417
Wow.
This is an amazing place.

33:37.450 --> 33:40.887
(Luis)
We have right now
about 3,200 square feet.

33:40.920 --> 33:41.921
- 75.
- Wow.

33:41.955 --> 33:43.156
I've actually searched

33:43.189 --> 33:45.091
for 75 feet of frontage
of entertainment space

33:45.091 --> 33:46.359
in Central Park South,

33:46.393 --> 33:48.628
and there hasn't been one
for at least 30 years.

33:50.630 --> 33:53.733
[speaking Spanish]

33:53.767 --> 33:55.201
Price is $18 million.

33:58.872 --> 34:00.206
Done.
Done and done.

34:00.240 --> 34:01.675
Now get yourself a drink.

34:01.708 --> 34:02.876
- Thank you.
- Good to see you.

34:02.909 --> 34:04.144
Ryan.

34:04.177 --> 34:05.945
Finally decided to show up.

34:06.046 --> 34:07.447
Uh-huh.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.649
So what do you think?

34:09.683 --> 34:12.852
It's the most beautiful display
of plumbing risers

34:12.886 --> 34:14.054
I've ever seen.

34:14.087 --> 34:16.456
* *

34:16.489 --> 34:18.324
(Ryan)
It seems a little strange to me

34:18.358 --> 34:19.926
that Luis would just drop
the negotiation

34:19.959 --> 34:22.429
without getting
Michael's apartment,

34:22.462 --> 34:24.898
but I certainly
did not get involved in this

34:24.931 --> 34:26.266
to walk away with nothing.

34:26.299 --> 34:29.169
All right,
so here's the deal.

34:31.471 --> 34:33.106
Michael's not easy,

34:33.139 --> 34:34.741
but I've worked my ass off
for you.

34:34.774 --> 34:36.076
He believes so strongly

34:36.109 --> 34:38.578
that the apartment is only worth
$1 1/2 million.

34:38.611 --> 34:42.415
They're willing to offer you
a $1 million premium over that.

34:58.765 --> 35:00.066
I'm gonna save your breath.

35:00.100 --> 35:03.069
If you have an offer
at $4 million still,

35:03.103 --> 35:04.604
we're not interested.

35:04.637 --> 35:06.573
We weren't interested before,
we're not interested now,

35:06.606 --> 35:07.707
and we will not be interested
in the future.

35:07.741 --> 35:10.043
Shh.
I'm still talking.

35:10.043 --> 35:11.511
The apartment's worth
$1.5 million.

35:11.544 --> 35:13.179
You and I both know that.
I'm not stupid.

35:13.213 --> 35:14.347
You're not stupid.

35:14.381 --> 35:15.849
If you want to buy him out

35:15.882 --> 35:18.852
so that you can get
all of that back space,

35:18.885 --> 35:21.554
I want a 100% markup.

35:21.588 --> 35:23.857
I want $3 million.

35:23.890 --> 35:27.160
[tense music]

35:27.193 --> 35:30.363
I feel that I'm being forced
out of the apartment

35:30.397 --> 35:31.931
that I love to live in,

35:31.965 --> 35:33.433
with a crowbar,

35:33.466 --> 35:35.869
but if it's
a million-dollar crowbar...

35:35.902 --> 35:37.971
It's a million-dollar crowbar.

35:38.071 --> 35:39.472
Then I would sell.

35:39.506 --> 35:41.608
- That's an expensive crowbar.
- Million-dollar crowbar.

35:41.641 --> 35:42.609
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

35:42.642 --> 35:45.078
This is still an amazing deal.

35:45.111 --> 35:48.348
If Michael doesn't get out now
and those towers go up,

35:48.381 --> 35:50.884
uh, he's f***ed.

35:52.085 --> 35:54.421
You really are...

35:54.454 --> 35:56.690
Beautiful,
I know.

35:58.625 --> 36:00.026
3 million bucks.

36:00.060 --> 36:02.629
You got yourself a deal.

36:05.165 --> 36:06.766
I think I want
a little more now.

36:06.800 --> 36:09.769
[tense music]

36:09.803 --> 36:14.808
* *

36:14.841 --> 36:17.177
You know, I hate you,
and I love you at the same time.

36:17.210 --> 36:20.413
Shake my hand,
'cause this is not gonna last.

36:20.447 --> 36:22.649
[upbeat music]

36:22.682 --> 36:24.551
Deal.

36:24.584 --> 36:26.252
I have to admit
that you are--

36:26.286 --> 36:27.654
You brought
the best of me.

36:27.687 --> 36:29.656
- [laughs]
- Good job, really.

36:29.689 --> 36:30.957
You as well.
I don't think anyone else

36:31.057 --> 36:32.625
could have kept me
at the table for that long.

36:32.659 --> 36:33.927
Do you want to get a drink
and celebrate?

36:33.960 --> 36:35.061
- Yes.
- Come here.

36:35.061 --> 36:36.529
Let's do it.

36:36.563 --> 36:39.099
Ryan and I have always been
very competitive.

36:39.132 --> 36:42.569
That's why we've always had
a rocky relationship.

36:43.737 --> 36:45.171
- Is that really yours?
- Uh, yes.

36:45.205 --> 36:46.172
- Did you buy that?
- Yes.

36:46.206 --> 36:47.607
(Ryan)
How expensive is that?

36:47.640 --> 36:48.942
Maybe I need to come
work for you.

36:48.975 --> 36:50.543
- Maybe.
- You are rich.

36:50.577 --> 36:53.346
But I think tonight
we walk away from this deal

36:53.380 --> 36:55.648
with mutual respect
for each other.

36:55.682 --> 36:58.685
And I'm also walking away with
a $25 million apartment to sell.

36:58.718 --> 37:00.787
(Ryan)
Luis did a good job.

37:00.820 --> 37:02.055
And so did I.

37:02.088 --> 37:03.757
Luis got
what his developer wanted,

37:03.790 --> 37:05.425
and I got
what my seller wanted.

37:05.458 --> 37:06.793
So, listen, we actually
finally did a deal.

37:06.826 --> 37:08.028
Finally.

37:08.061 --> 37:09.562
This one was a little more
intense than usual.

37:09.596 --> 37:10.830
This one was very intense.

37:10.864 --> 37:11.931
(Ryan)
At the end of the day,

37:12.032 --> 37:14.501
what's most important
is our clients.

37:14.534 --> 37:16.202
And through all of it,

37:16.236 --> 37:19.305
we basically got our clients
exactly what they wanted.

37:19.339 --> 37:21.808
So, for old times' sake
and to looking forward...

37:21.841 --> 37:22.876
Absolutely.

37:22.909 --> 37:24.044
And sh**'s about to get real.

37:24.044 --> 37:25.045
Let's go.

37:25.045 --> 37:26.479
- Bitch.
- You f***er.

37:26.513 --> 37:28.882
[Luis laughs]

[light guitar music]

37:35.088 --> 37:36.122

37:36.156 --> 37:37.724
Where are we going?

37:37.757 --> 37:39.159
I got a surprise.

37:39.192 --> 37:40.660
I don't like surprises.

37:40.694 --> 37:42.729
This past year has been...

37:42.762 --> 37:46.399
I mean, my craziest year,
to date.

37:46.433 --> 37:47.500
(woman)
Congratulations.

37:47.534 --> 37:48.968
Here's your next project
to sell out.

37:49.069 --> 37:49.969
What?

37:50.070 --> 37:51.071
This is the next building.

37:51.071 --> 37:53.073
20 million bucks,
here I come, baby!

37:53.073 --> 37:54.174
[laughs]

37:54.207 --> 37:55.342
Whoo!

37:55.375 --> 37:56.843
What do you think
about living here?

37:56.876 --> 37:58.545
- What are you saying?
- I think we should buy it.

37:58.578 --> 38:00.780
And I think I say
that every year,

38:00.814 --> 38:03.249
but I also think that
that's how it's supposed to be.

38:03.283 --> 38:04.317
Did you get me a pony?

38:04.351 --> 38:05.919
I didn't get you a pony.

38:06.019 --> 38:09.022
I want every year to be bigger
and better than the last,

38:09.055 --> 38:12.859
both professionally
and personally.

38:12.892 --> 38:15.261
Emilia,
will you marry me?

38:15.295 --> 38:17.030
[sobs]

38:17.030 --> 38:20.233
I went from single
to girlfriend

38:20.266 --> 38:22.335
to now being engaged,

38:22.369 --> 38:26.039
and next year
I'm gonna be married, and then--

38:26.039 --> 38:29.042
Oh, my God.
I have to have kids.

38:29.042 --> 38:31.444
(Emilia)
I got promoted today.

38:31.478 --> 38:34.881
They want me to move
to Geneva.

38:34.914 --> 38:37.650
To Geneva?

38:37.684 --> 38:39.119
- I am--
- Put your phone away.

38:39.152 --> 38:41.154
- Look.
- My phone is away.

38:44.090 --> 38:46.126
[whispering]
Why are we at a furniture store?

38:46.159 --> 38:49.229
We need nice furniture...

38:49.262 --> 38:53.166
now that I'm gonna stay...

38:53.199 --> 38:54.434
in New York.

38:54.467 --> 38:57.303
I turned down the job
in Switzerland.

38:57.337 --> 38:59.472
What?

38:59.506 --> 39:02.175
I want to be here.

39:04.010 --> 39:06.146
[laughs]
Good.

39:06.179 --> 39:09.549
If I could,
I would go back in time,

39:09.582 --> 39:12.852
and I would go up
to my little kid self,

39:12.886 --> 39:16.456
and I would just say,
"You made it."

39:16.489 --> 39:18.491
All right, let's go
furniture shopping.

39:18.525 --> 39:20.126
* *

39:20.160 --> 39:22.696
- I think the chair's cool.
- That's awesome.

39:22.729 --> 39:24.330
- That fits you very well.
- That looks like you.

39:24.364 --> 39:26.066
- Yeah.
- Very white and leathery.

39:26.099 --> 39:27.100
[women laugh]

39:27.133 --> 39:28.935
[whispering]
This looks like

39:29.035 --> 39:30.070
really expensive furniture.

39:30.103 --> 39:32.372
It is very expensive
furniture.

39:32.405 --> 39:34.040
Maybe we should go
to Geneva.

39:34.040 --> 39:35.508
Uh, no.

39:35.542 --> 39:37.410
[laughs]

39:37.444 --> 39:39.679

39:39.713 --> 39:40.880
(Ronita)
Look what we got.

39:40.914 --> 39:43.049
Ricellys
got a new exclusive.

39:43.083 --> 39:44.451
I love it.

39:44.484 --> 39:45.952
I know.
It's a good one.

39:46.052 --> 39:48.621
This year has been...

39:48.655 --> 39:49.856
a hell of a journey.

39:49.889 --> 39:51.224
I think we're having
a problem.

39:51.257 --> 39:52.859
I know.
We're making a lot of mistakes.

39:52.892 --> 39:54.594
I think we just need
additional support.

39:54.627 --> 39:57.664
We need some help.

39:57.697 --> 40:00.000
One of the most important things
that I've learned...

40:00.033 --> 40:01.167
Good morning, guys.

40:01.201 --> 40:02.502
Good morning, good morning,
good morning.

40:02.535 --> 40:04.871
Is that I have to surround
myself with great people.

40:04.904 --> 40:06.773
We got a new member
on our team--Devin Leahy.

40:06.806 --> 40:08.975
I'm sure everybody already
have actually met him.

40:09.009 --> 40:11.878
That's why I'm continuing
to grow my team.

40:11.911 --> 40:15.015
Last week we did $37 million
in contracts,

40:15.048 --> 40:16.316
so congratulations.

40:16.349 --> 40:17.851
[applause]

40:17.884 --> 40:19.152
But it's not only in business.

[light piano music]

40:26.993 --> 40:29.329
- Luis.
- Yes.

40:30.530 --> 40:32.298
In your apartment.

40:33.833 --> 40:35.101
I know a lot of people.

40:35.135 --> 40:36.636

40:36.670 --> 40:38.805
[laughter]

40:38.838 --> 40:40.640
(Luis)
We got paella. We got empanadas.

40:40.674 --> 40:43.209
And vegetable and shrimp.
We got mofongo.

40:43.243 --> 40:45.345
I'm now making
a very conscious decision

40:45.378 --> 40:47.781
to change all aspects
of my life.

40:47.814 --> 40:49.449
I must say, I'm amazed--

40:49.482 --> 40:50.917
taking care of the dinner.

40:50.950 --> 40:53.019
I'm becoming a new man.

40:53.053 --> 40:55.422
- There he is.
- Hey.

40:57.590 --> 40:59.793
Can I get you
some wine, please?

40:59.826 --> 41:01.528
Guys, listen.

41:01.561 --> 41:04.964
I just realize that life
really is about memories,

41:05.065 --> 41:06.866
and it's about friendship,
and it's about family,

41:06.900 --> 41:08.802
and it's about spending time
with people that you love

41:08.835 --> 41:12.706
and sharing those moments
that you'll forever remember.

41:12.739 --> 41:15.308
So I love you incredibly,

41:15.342 --> 41:19.145
and this year is going to be
the best.

You're selling it.

41:35.095 --> 41:36.396
(Fredrik)
This was the perfect time

41:36.429 --> 41:38.098
to write and release a book.

41:38.098 --> 41:40.133
- You're slouching.
- Slouching?

41:40.166 --> 41:41.801
Mm-hmm.
Stand more erect.

41:41.835 --> 41:43.470
- Erect?
- Mm-hmm.

41:43.503 --> 41:45.405
[laughter]

41:45.438 --> 41:46.973
(Fredrik)
I'm the number-one
real-estate agent

41:47.007 --> 41:50.610
in New York City,
but the irony of this

41:50.643 --> 41:52.579
is that it's almost like
an end of an era.

41:52.612 --> 41:54.214
- Oh.
- That's amazing.

41:54.247 --> 41:56.116
- That's it. That is nice.
- Money shot.

41:56.116 --> 41:58.118
The book is,
cover to cover,

41:58.118 --> 42:01.087
400 pages of information.

42:01.121 --> 42:02.856
And when I close that,
release it,

42:02.889 --> 42:06.292
send it off to the readers,
a new chapter starts.

42:06.326 --> 42:09.529
It's almost like a new book
in my life.

42:09.562 --> 42:11.598
I'm always gonna be doing
real estate,

42:11.631 --> 42:13.633
but now...

42:13.667 --> 42:15.869
You have paint
in your nose.

42:15.902 --> 42:17.070
I'm gonna be a father.

42:17.103 --> 42:19.172
Milla!

42:19.205 --> 42:21.941
Priorities are gonna switch
and change.

42:21.975 --> 42:24.878
Are you gonna fit a little crib,
baby crib in here too?

42:24.911 --> 42:27.213
Maybe we can do a painting
of her when she arrives.

42:27.247 --> 42:30.216
I have so many visions of me,
Derek, and Milla--

42:30.250 --> 42:32.118
this new trio.

42:32.152 --> 42:34.120
Every night as the sun sets,

42:34.154 --> 42:37.657
we walk by the river
and this little baby carriage,

42:37.691 --> 42:39.592
and there she is--
this blonde little creature

42:39.626 --> 42:41.161
with big blue eyes,

42:41.194 --> 42:45.899
and I just feel such calmness.

42:45.932 --> 42:48.768
She basically gonna be
in our arms

42:48.802 --> 42:50.170
this time next year.

42:50.203 --> 42:53.106
To have a family,
to be in love,

42:53.106 --> 42:56.242
to be married,
and to have Milla,

42:56.276 --> 42:58.578
it's finally a reality.
