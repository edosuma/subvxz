00:11.000 --> 00:13.730
Previously on 24

00:14.000 --> 00:15.730
Ken Dellao, CNB.

00:15.800 --> 00:17.900
I'm wondering if you can confirm some information.

00:17.960 --> 00:20.230
I'm gonna be reporting

00:20.300 --> 00:21.800
in this evening's broadcast

00:21.860 --> 00:23.900
that a rogue ex-federal agent named Jack Bauer

00:23.960 --> 00:26.700
is the prime suspect in the murder of Ryan Burnett.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.660
You leaked this story of Burnett's murder

00:28.730 --> 00:30.600
and my involvement to the press.

00:30.660 --> 00:34.400
So another one of your errors in judgment bites you on the ass.

00:34.460 --> 00:36.330
You've gone too far this time.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.400
Renee, it'Jack. Don't hang up the phone, please.

00:38.460 --> 00:40.460
Whatever they told you, I did not kill Burnett.

00:40.530 --> 00:42.760
I sent you a photo of the man who did.

00:42.830 --> 00:44.760
All I want you to do is make an ID.

00:44.830 --> 00:47.400
John Quinn, Black Ops combat vet.

00:47.460 --> 00:48.960
He works for Starkwood.

00:49.030 --> 00:50.130
Starkwood work with Juma?

00:50.200 --> 00:51.700
They didn't on the books.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.860
You know, if anyone knows, it's Senator Mayer.

00:53.930 --> 00:57.060
Renee, where's Bauer?

00:57.130 --> 00:59.030
- I don't know.  - Don't you lie to me.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.230
We know you accessed

01:00.300 --> 01:01.700
a classified government database

01:01.760 --> 01:03.360
and sent someone's name and address to Bauer.

01:03.430 --> 01:04.560
Tell me where he is.

01:04.629 --> 01:05.730
I can't.

01:05.800 --> 01:06.930
Put her in holding.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.930
Mirandize her.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.500
If Bauer connects us to Juma,

01:10.560 --> 01:12.000
it could seriously impede this operation.

01:12.060 --> 01:14.000
Yes, it could.

01:14.060 --> 01:16.000
Is the shipment on time?

01:16.060 --> 01:18.900
Yes. Due into port in the next hour.

01:18.960 --> 01:20.260
Once the weapons are deployed,

01:20.330 --> 01:22.260
then it doesn't matter what Mr. Bauer

01:22.330 --> 01:23.760
or anyone else knows.

01:23.830 --> 01:25.430
I didn't kill Burnett.

01:25.500 --> 01:26.460
This man did.

01:26.530 --> 01:27.800
His name is John Quinn.

01:27.860 --> 01:29.760
He works for Starkwood.

01:29.830 --> 01:31.960
And what does Starkwood have to do with this?

01:32.030 --> 01:34.160
Your informant claims that Starkwood was trying

01:34.230 --> 01:36.500
to acquire a bioweapon, and that's your connection to Juma.

01:36.560 --> 01:37.960
You've been trying to dismantle Starkwood

01:38.030 --> 01:39.500
for the last six months.

01:39.560 --> 01:40.760
If they have a weapon like this,

01:40.830 --> 01:42.630
you'd better believe they intend to use it.

01:44.700 --> 01:46.300
No!

01:49.230 --> 01:50.930
Just tell me where the weapons are coming in.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.200
You're too late.

01:53.260 --> 01:55.630
They're already here.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:33.230 --> 02:34.860
Sir?

02:34.930 --> 02:37.630
Preliminary sweep of the immediate area's done.

02:37.700 --> 02:40.630
There's no sign of Bauer.

02:40.700 --> 02:42.130
All right, widen the grid.

02:42.200 --> 02:44.160
And run down security cameras around the perimeter, witnesses.

02:44.230 --> 02:46.160
Somebody must have seen him.

02:46.230 --> 02:48.500
Yes, sir.

03:02.830 --> 03:04.200
- Kanin?  - Yes?

03:04.260 --> 03:06.000
Mr. Kanin, it's Larry Moss.

03:06.060 --> 03:07.660
Agent Moss,

03:07.730 --> 03:10.300
please tell me you have Jack Bauer in custody.

03:10.360 --> 03:14.200
I wish that were the case, Mr. Kanin, but the truth is...

03:15.330 --> 03:18.800
Sir, it's Senator Mayer.

03:18.860 --> 03:20.560
He's dead.

03:20.630 --> 03:22.430
What?!

03:22.500 --> 03:24.060
He was murdered at his house.

03:24.130 --> 03:25.430
We only found out

03:25.500 --> 03:27.430
that Bauer was on his way over here a short time ago.

03:27.500 --> 03:28.600
Unfortunately, we got here too late.

03:28.660 --> 03:29.760
Wait a minute.

03:29.830 --> 03:32.100
Are you telling me

03:32.160 --> 03:35.200
that Jack Bauer just killed a United States Senator?

03:35.260 --> 03:37.600
That's the assumption that we're working under, yes, sir.

03:39.530 --> 03:42.230
How could you have let this happen?!

03:42.300 --> 03:44.330
He had us all fooled, sir.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.900
I released Jack Bauer into your custody!

03:46.960 --> 03:49.560
I ordered you to keep him on a short leash!

03:49.630 --> 03:52.430
No, no, Mr. Kanin, you are not gonna lay this one at my feet.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.930
It was your decision to give Bauer access to Burnett.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.330
I advised you against it.

03:59.360 --> 04:01.360
Mr. Kanin?

04:05.060 --> 04:07.000
I'm sorry. Uh,

04:07.060 --> 04:09.060
what did you say?

04:09.130 --> 04:11.260
I said, I advised you

04:11.330 --> 04:13.430
against it.

04:13.500 --> 04:16.260
Yes, you did.

04:18.130 --> 04:20.959
Sir, I have teams sweeping the area.

04:21.029 --> 04:23.130
Just find him, Agent Moss.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.660
Yeah, I will.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.700
Starkwood was involved with everything that happened today.

04:47.760 --> 04:49.600
They were the ones that helped Juma and his men

04:49.660 --> 04:51.330
bring down those planes and attack the White House.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.260
In exchange, they were allowed to develop

04:53.330 --> 04:55.500
and manufacture a WMD in Sangala.

04:55.560 --> 04:56.700
It's a bioweapon.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.560
Apparently, it's already here in the US.

04:58.630 --> 04:59.760
Who else knows about this?

04:59.830 --> 05:01.430
No one. Senator Mayer and I

05:01.500 --> 05:02.860
were piecing together the information

05:02.930 --> 05:04.300
right before he was killed.

05:04.360 --> 05:05.800
You said the weapon's already here.

05:05.860 --> 05:07.200
Are they in possession of it?

05:07.260 --> 05:08.930
I don't think so. The text message I got

05:09.000 --> 05:11.060
off their agent's cell phone said, "Port of Alexandria,

05:11.130 --> 05:12.860
Lot C, 10:15 p.m."

05:12.930 --> 05:15.060
Why don't we just call the FBI and lock the whole place down?

05:15.130 --> 05:16.230
Because we're fugitives, Tony.

05:16.300 --> 05:17.530
No one's going to believe us.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.500
We need to know exactly where that weapon is

05:19.560 --> 05:20.830
before we call anyone else in.

05:20.900 --> 05:23.330
Tony, I need to know if you're with me on this.

05:23.400 --> 05:25.960
Yeah, I'm with you.

05:26.030 --> 05:27.860
Okay. Meet me at the north end of the port.

05:27.930 --> 05:29.560
There's an access road right before the main entrance.

05:29.630 --> 05:32.200
All right, I'll be there.

05:35.530 --> 05:37.400
It's over.

05:37.460 --> 05:39.930
Dubaku and Juma are dead.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.330
Everyone responsible for the terrorist attacks...

05:44.400 --> 05:47.600
responsible for Roger.

05:47.660 --> 05:51.430
Thank God for that.

05:51.500 --> 05:54.230
And there's... there's something else.

05:54.300 --> 05:57.860
Something good that's come out of all of this.

05:57.930 --> 05:59.660
Olivia

05:59.730 --> 06:01.660
is here at the White House.

06:01.730 --> 06:03.230
Olivia?

06:03.300 --> 06:06.500
She's come home, Henry.

06:06.560 --> 06:11.130
The crisis... it brought us together.

06:11.200 --> 06:14.530
I've asked her to stay on as Special Advisor, 

06:14.600 --> 06:16.000
and she's agreed.

06:16.060 --> 06:18.100
Ally...

06:18.160 --> 06:19.860
I can't begin to tell you

06:19.930 --> 06:22.460
how happy that makes me.

06:22.530 --> 06:24.900
Me, too.

06:24.960 --> 06:27.130
Sweetheart, I know that you're tired.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.900
You should get some rest.

06:28.960 --> 06:31.430
Olivia and I will come to the hospital

06:31.500 --> 06:33.030
just as soon as we can.

06:33.100 --> 06:35.060
When you can.

06:35.130 --> 06:37.930
I'm not going anywhere.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.200
Give Olivia my love.

06:41.260 --> 06:43.960
Love you.

06:44.030 --> 06:46.060
We love you, too.

06:53.560 --> 06:57.430
The doctors expect him to make a full recovery.

06:58.400 --> 07:02.100
Henry's a lot tougher than anyone thought.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.000
Oh, maybe, maybe, maybe, just maybe,

07:04.060 --> 07:07.060
this day will end on a positive note.

07:15.160 --> 07:17.330
What is it, Ethan? What's wrong?

07:19.360 --> 07:21.900
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, Madam President,

07:21.960 --> 07:24.530
but Senator Mayer is dead.

07:24.600 --> 07:27.000
What happened?

07:27.060 --> 07:31.100
All evidence points to the fact that he was murdered

07:31.160 --> 07:32.700
by Jack Bauer.

07:32.760 --> 07:34.760
Bauer?

07:34.830 --> 07:37.100
It's hard to believe, I know.

07:37.160 --> 07:38.960
It... It doesn't make any sense.

07:39.030 --> 07:40.360
After everything

07:40.430 --> 07:41.960
he has done today,

07:42.030 --> 07:43.860
why on earth would he do this?

07:43.930 --> 07:46.660
We'll know more

07:46.730 --> 07:48.760
when we find him.

07:48.830 --> 07:50.800
My God.

07:52.930 --> 07:55.700
Madam President,

07:55.760 --> 07:57.600
in light of what's happened,

07:57.660 --> 08:00.300
and for the sake of your administration,

08:00.360 --> 08:02.160
I'm afraid I have no choice but to resign

08:02.230 --> 08:03.360
as your Chief of Staff.

08:03.430 --> 08:04.530
Ethan!

08:04.600 --> 08:09.300
Madam President, please, you need to hear this.

08:09.360 --> 08:12.230
Inevitably, it'll come to light that I sanctioned

08:12.300 --> 08:15.360
Bauer's release from custody.

08:15.430 --> 08:18.700
Unless I step down immediately,

08:18.760 --> 08:21.030
the damage to your office, and you personally,

08:21.100 --> 08:25.400
will be extensive.

08:25.460 --> 08:28.660
Ethan, Olivia has already killed this story once today.

08:28.730 --> 08:31.230
We can control the damage.

08:31.300 --> 08:32.429
No.

08:32.500 --> 08:37.030
No, not even Olivia can control it now.

08:37.100 --> 08:40.929
Not after the senator's murder.

08:42.659 --> 08:45.730
The truth is, Madam President,

08:45.800 --> 08:49.030
I didn't do enough to protect you.

08:49.100 --> 08:51.630
The truth is, I failed you.

08:51.700 --> 08:53.100
And I should...

08:53.160 --> 08:55.300
shoulder the blame for what's happened.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.900
Ethan, really, you're...

08:57.960 --> 08:59.300
you're taking this too far.

08:59.360 --> 09:01.300
Am I?

09:01.360 --> 09:04.360
I'm not so sure.

09:04.430 --> 09:06.230
As your daughter has made abundantly clear,

09:06.300 --> 09:09.600
I have a lot to answer for.

09:09.660 --> 09:14.300
You have done nothing but be an invaluable advisor to me

09:14.360 --> 09:15.760
and an even better friend.

09:15.830 --> 09:17.560
I appreciate you saying that,

09:17.630 --> 09:21.600
Madam President, but Olivia right.

09:21.660 --> 09:24.530
The political knives will be out.

09:24.600 --> 09:27.500
Every decision I've made will be scrutinized.

09:27.560 --> 09:29.460
There will be calls

09:29.530 --> 09:31.660
for a special prosecutor.

09:34.830 --> 09:38.000
You're a great woman, Allison.

09:40.560 --> 09:42.930
You have great work yet to do.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.660
I'm a liability

09:44.730 --> 09:47.300
to you now.

09:47.360 --> 09:51.460
Don't let me compromise your next three years in office.

09:51.530 --> 09:53.300
Don't let me sink

09:53.360 --> 09:55.330
your agenda.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.700
Our agenda, Ethan.

10:01.960 --> 10:04.060
Yes.

10:04.130 --> 10:06.160
Our agenda.

10:10.260 --> 10:12.200
Trust me, Madam President,

10:12.260 --> 10:15.660
it's the right thing to do.

10:17.100 --> 10:19.730
Accept my resignation.

10:31.600 --> 10:34.660
I'll have a letter on your desk in the morning.

10:51.260 --> 10:52.800
They're gonna be here any minute.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.630
We need to narrow down the search.

10:54.700 --> 10:55.930
If they offloaded it today,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.030
it should still be on the storage dock.

10:58.100 --> 11:00.160
That's still a needle in a haystack, Jack.

11:00.230 --> 11:03.500
There must be over a thousand containers in there.

11:03.560 --> 11:04.960
We need to access the yard's manifest.

11:05.030 --> 11:06.560
What's the security?

11:06.630 --> 11:09.060
- I've spotted one Port Authority officer.  - That's it?

11:09.130 --> 11:10.830
That's it.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.260
There's got to be more.

11:12.330 --> 11:13.660
Come on, let's go.

11:14.930 --> 11:16.430
Honey, it'll be fine.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.160
I get relieved in a few hours.

11:18.230 --> 11:20.600
Carl, you know I don't like you working double shifts.

11:20.660 --> 11:22.330
Well, it was my choice.

11:22.400 --> 11:23.860
And we could use the overtime.

11:23.930 --> 11:25.500
How are the girls?

11:25.560 --> 11:26.830
Kicking like a chorus line tonight.

11:26.900 --> 11:28.800
They miss their daddy.

11:28.860 --> 11:30.160
What'd the doctor say?

11:30.230 --> 11:34.130
That I'm lucky it's not triplets.

11:37.500 --> 11:39.500
Honey, let me call you back.

12:08.360 --> 12:11.130
Don't even think about going for your weapon.

12:14.130 --> 12:16.730
I need the port's manifest. Where is it?

12:16.800 --> 12:18.400
I'm just a PA cop.

12:18.460 --> 12:19.960
Where is it?

12:20.030 --> 12:22.130
Customs House.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.500
That way.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.400
We on schedule?

12:39.460 --> 12:40.800
We're at the staging area

12:40.860 --> 12:42.800
near the port, sir, but we're still waiting on Quinn.

12:42.860 --> 12:44.230
He should have been there by now.

12:44.300 --> 12:45.460
Have you heard from him?

12:45.530 --> 12:47.460
We've tried his cell, but he's not answering.

12:48.500 --> 12:51.160
If Bauer took out Quinn,

12:51.230 --> 12:53.160
he might have knowledge of the operation.

12:53.230 --> 12:54.760
Mightn't he?

12:54.830 --> 12:56.830
Should we stand down, sir?

12:58.330 --> 13:00.760
No. Give Quinn five more minutes,

13:00.830 --> 13:02.700
then go in.

13:02.760 --> 13:05.760
Do so with extreme caution

13:05.830 --> 13:07.130
then contact me the minute

13:07.200 --> 13:08.600
that you've secured the container.

13:08.660 --> 13:10.130
Yes sir.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.530
Everybody on the board is here, sir.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.760
You have a worried look, Greg.

13:15.830 --> 13:17.960
It's very tense in there, sir.

13:18.030 --> 13:20.130
They're six-year-olds, Greg.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.530
And they need to eat their carrots.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.560
It's been a rough day for the United States of America.

13:35.630 --> 13:37.460
The White Hous under siege,

13:37.530 --> 13:39.230
the President taken hostage...

13:39.300 --> 13:40.430
It's especially painful

13:40.500 --> 13:41.830
because we know this didn't have to be.

13:43.360 --> 13:45.730
the United States military

13:45.800 --> 13:47.500
is strained to the breaking point.

13:47.560 --> 13:50.700
Fact reinstatement of the draft

13:50.760 --> 13:53.560
is off the table for political reasons.

13:53.630 --> 13:56.600
The people in this room, you all control

13:56.660 --> 14:00.000
the largest private army in the Western hemisphere.

14:00.060 --> 14:02.200
Now, could we have been of help today?

14:02.260 --> 14:05.400
You bet your ass we could've been of help!

14:05.460 --> 14:07.060
But they didn't call us, did they?

14:07.130 --> 14:09.060
No. Instead,

14:09.130 --> 14:11.100
we sit here, our contracts are canceled,

14:11.160 --> 14:14.100
our soldiers vilified, our corporate sovereignty

14:14.160 --> 14:16.260
is threatened by Congressional Fiat.

14:16.330 --> 14:18.660
Doug, you brokered the deal with this government.

14:18.730 --> 14:20.500
You were short-sighted

14:20.560 --> 14:22.060
and they don't understand that the global war

14:22.130 --> 14:24.060
on terror can only be won

14:24.130 --> 14:25.300
by forces like ours.

14:25.360 --> 14:27.260
So as of this minute, we sit

14:27.330 --> 14:28.900
for no more depositions.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.400
We volunteer no more documents.

14:30.460 --> 14:31.730
I don't even want us to take

14:31.800 --> 14:33.560
- any phone calls.  - Is that what this is about?

14:33.630 --> 14:35.960
- With the security of our country,  - Is that what this is about?

14:36.030 --> 14:37.660
we cannot afford to let them take us down.

14:37.730 --> 14:39.100
Is that what this is about then?

14:39.160 --> 14:41.260
You came here

14:41.330 --> 14:44.760
to ask the board to risk a federal indictment?

14:44.830 --> 14:46.560
It won't work, Jonas.

14:46.630 --> 14:48.230
We got a deal.

14:48.300 --> 14:51.230
It's a good deal and we're lucky to have it.

14:51.300 --> 14:53.630
With an administration that wants to destroy us.

14:53.700 --> 14:55.060
Wants to take us out of business.

14:55.130 --> 14:57.230
No, it's all different now.

14:57.300 --> 14:58.400
Today was a game-changer.

14:58.460 --> 15:00.430
No, institutionally,

15:00.500 --> 15:02.630
we are in compliance with the subpoena.

15:02.700 --> 15:03.760
Documents have been filed,

15:03.830 --> 15:05.100
depositions taken.

15:05.160 --> 15:06.260
Not anymore.

15:06.330 --> 15:08.800
Jonas, we have to stay engaged with this

15:08.860 --> 15:11.300
- administration.  - No, we don't, Doug.

15:11.360 --> 15:12.730
So look, you and I can talk this out.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.900
If you guys have any questions,

15:14.960 --> 15:16.000
any further questions, Greg, you will

15:16.060 --> 15:17.560
stick around and you'll answer them.

15:17.630 --> 15:18.800
Thank you for coming everyone.

15:18.860 --> 15:20.200
Thank you.

15:27.130 --> 15:29.700
Your way was a mistake, Doug.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.400
You have to acknowledge that.

15:31.460 --> 15:34.430
Maybe. But you and I both know

15:34.500 --> 15:35.800
that Starkwood cannot survive

15:35.860 --> 15:37.330
an all-out war against the subcommittee.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.800
Let me worry about that.

15:39.860 --> 15:42.000
No, you should worry about Senator Mayer.

15:42.060 --> 15:43.900
He's not going to let go of this.

15:43.960 --> 15:45.300
He's got his teeth in it.

15:47.030 --> 15:48.460
Senator Mayer's dead.

15:50.260 --> 15:52.430
He was killed by a rogue federal agent

15:52.500 --> 15:54.830
not one hour ago, tragically.

15:58.630 --> 16:00.130
Jonas.

16:05.330 --> 16:07.700
Tell me you had nothing to do with this.

16:09.330 --> 16:11.930
Are you accusing me of complicity

16:12.000 --> 16:14.300
in the murder of Senator Mayer?

16:14.360 --> 16:16.800
I want a personal assurance.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.430
Starkwood is not in the business

16:21.500 --> 16:23.200
of political assassination, Doug.

16:24.600 --> 16:28.700
Though maybe we should look into it.

16:39.360 --> 16:41.730
Jack, you finding anything?

16:41.800 --> 16:43.460
I hear it's 12 ships were unloaded here today.

16:43.530 --> 16:45.000
Any from Sangala?

16:45.060 --> 16:47.460
There's no deepwater port in that area of West Africa.

16:47.530 --> 16:49.130
If the weapon originated from there,

16:49.200 --> 16:52.560
it would've had to overland into Pointe-Noire.

16:52.630 --> 16:54.760
Where...

16:54.830 --> 16:56.700
two of the 12 ships acquired

16:56.760 --> 16:59.030
cargo from that port within the last four weeks.

17:00.730 --> 17:02.030
Come on.

17:03.460 --> 17:05.660
Come on. Damn it!

17:05.730 --> 17:07.560
- What is it?  - I can't access

17:07.599 --> 17:09.460
their manifests; their database is password protected.

17:14.900 --> 17:16.000
What's your name, officer?

17:16.060 --> 17:17.200
Gadsen.

17:17.260 --> 17:18.430
Carl Gadsen.

17:18.500 --> 17:19.599
I don't have any information

17:19.660 --> 17:20.859
about a password.

17:20.930 --> 17:23.430
Carl, I want you to listen to me very carefully.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.230
The same terrorists who took down two planes earlier today

17:25.300 --> 17:26.599
and attacked the White House are trying

17:26.660 --> 17:27.829
to acquire a weapon of mass destruction.

17:27.900 --> 17:29.800
They're coming here to pick up that weapon.

17:29.860 --> 17:31.230
It's somewhere out there

17:31.300 --> 17:33.030
in your yard in one of those canisters.

17:33.100 --> 17:34.930
Look, I understand this might be hard

17:35.000 --> 17:37.200
- for you to believe.  - No, actually, it's not.

17:37.260 --> 17:38.800
You don't have a lot of time.

17:38.860 --> 17:40.300
What do you mean?

17:40.360 --> 17:42.100
They are coming.

17:42.160 --> 17:43.530
In fact, they should be here already.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.230
Keep talking, Carl.

17:45.300 --> 17:47.200
They told me they were smuggling in

17:47.260 --> 17:48.530
electronics from South Korea.

17:48.600 --> 17:49.560
I swear.

17:49.630 --> 17:51.860
I had no idea they were terrorists.

17:51.930 --> 17:53.060
What'd you agree to do for them?

17:53.130 --> 17:54.800
Open the front gate. Look the other way.

17:54.860 --> 17:57.030
Is that it?

17:57.100 --> 17:58.300
Disable the security cameras.

17:58.360 --> 18:00.700
A yard this size should have more police officers.

18:00.760 --> 18:02.600
- Where are they?  - I'm the supervisor.

18:02.660 --> 18:04.100
I do the shift schedules.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.430
I made sure I'd be the only one here.

18:06.500 --> 18:08.400
That's enough confirmation for me.

18:08.460 --> 18:09.660
I'm making the call. Untie him.

18:09.730 --> 18:10.800
Who's he calling?

18:10.860 --> 18:12.500
The FBI. Now that we're confident

18:12.560 --> 18:14.900
the weapon's here, we're calling in the authorities.

18:19.330 --> 18:21.560
Tony? My cell is down, so is the landline.

18:21.630 --> 18:23.600
Someone's jamming communications.

18:30.730 --> 18:32.600
It's them.

18:32.660 --> 18:35.060
They gave me that radio; told me they'd be

18:35.130 --> 18:36.900
- contacting me.  - Answer the call. Just play along.

18:40.230 --> 18:41.900
Answer the call.

18:45.060 --> 18:46.030
Hello?

18:46.100 --> 18:47.030
Where are you?

18:47.100 --> 18:49.030
I didn't think you were coming.

18:49.100 --> 18:50.330
- You're late.  - Well, we're re now

18:50.400 --> 18:52.230
and we're waiting.

18:52.300 --> 18:54.730
Okay.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.100
They're at the front gate.

18:56.160 --> 18:57.560
Put your belt back on.

18:57.630 --> 18:59.000
I want you to resume your post.

18:59.060 --> 19:00.630
Pretend like everything's normal.

19:00.700 --> 19:02.200
- Just let them in.  - And then what?

19:02.260 --> 19:04.030
We're going to follow them as soon as they pick up

19:04.100 --> 19:05.600
their container; once we're past

19:05.660 --> 19:07.200
- the jamming grid, we'll make our call.  - I don't know.

19:07.260 --> 19:09.200
What do you mean you don't know?

19:09.260 --> 19:11.100
You're a part of this, Carl,

19:11.160 --> 19:12.630
whether you want to be or not.

19:12.700 --> 19:14.730
You became a part of it this the second you said

19:14.800 --> 19:16.500
- "yes" to these people.  - Jack!

19:16.560 --> 19:18.460
- What do you got?  - I got three vehicles.

19:18.530 --> 19:20.230
Eight hostiles,

19:20.300 --> 19:22.530
heavily armed; got to assume there's more inside the trucks.

19:22.600 --> 19:26.000
Carl, if you don't open that gate, they're going

19:26.060 --> 19:28.160
to come in here looking you, you understand me?

19:29.560 --> 19:31.430
Let me put it to you this way.

19:31.500 --> 19:34.460
These men have killed over 300 people today.

19:34.530 --> 19:36.660
If they get ahold of that weapon,

19:36.730 --> 19:39.000
they're going to make that look like child's play.

19:40.430 --> 19:42.900
You've only got one choice here.

19:45.230 --> 19:47.030
I just open the gate and let them in.

19:47.100 --> 19:48.700
That's all you've got to do.

19:48.760 --> 19:50.860
- And you guys got my back, right?  - Yeah.

19:50.930 --> 19:52.930
Promise me.

19:57.430 --> 19:58.860
I promise you.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.230
Okay.

20:04.300 --> 20:05.930
Tony, get the surveillance package.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.460
Don't worry.

20:07.530 --> 20:09.100
It's just so we can hear what's going on.

20:11.100 --> 20:12.400
Turn aroun

20:12.460 --> 20:14.630
I need to put this on your back.

20:14.700 --> 20:17.130
Listen, the money... it wasn't about

20:17.200 --> 20:19.300
greed or anything.

20:19.360 --> 20:21.760
It's my wife, Linda. She's having twins.

20:21.830 --> 20:24.000
They say it's the most natural thing in the world, right?

20:24.060 --> 20:25.160
Getting pregnant?

20:25.230 --> 20:27.200
Well, it took us three years,

20:27.260 --> 20:28.500
cost an arm and a leg.

20:28.560 --> 20:32.860
No excuses, but insurance doesn't cover a dime.

20:32.930 --> 20:34.660
I just always wanted to have a family.

20:34.730 --> 20:36.060
You know what I mean?

20:36.130 --> 20:38.130
Put this in your pocket.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.030
You got him?

20:40.100 --> 20:41.900
Yeah.

20:47.300 --> 20:48.830
Remember, it's just another

20:48.900 --> 20:50.230
day at the office.

20:50.300 --> 20:52.460
You're going to be fine.

21:14.760 --> 21:16.530
What took you so long, Carl?

21:16.600 --> 21:18.060
You got the routing documents?

21:18.130 --> 21:19.730
Sure.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.630
I need to see them in order to locate the container.

21:21.700 --> 21:23.900
Relax, Carl. They're right here.

21:26.960 --> 21:29.030
Okay.

21:29.100 --> 21:31.230
Center section.

21:31.300 --> 21:34.560
Row 36, Q-block.

21:34.630 --> 21:36.560
It's that fourth stack on your left.

21:37.960 --> 21:39.200
I know where the container is, Carl.

21:39.260 --> 21:42.530
Did you disable the security cameras?

21:42.600 --> 21:44.100
They've been off since 10:00,

21:44.160 --> 21:45.500
just like you said.

21:48.460 --> 21:49.900
How's your wife?

21:49.960 --> 21:52.130
She's fine.

21:53.760 --> 21:55.400
You didn't tell her anything about this, did you?

21:55.460 --> 21:57.700
No, of course not.

21:57.760 --> 21:59.860
Did you tell anybody else?

21:59.930 --> 22:01.460
No, no, why would I?

22:01.530 --> 22:03.500
You tell me,Carl.

22:04.530 --> 22:07.400
Why are you so nervous?

22:07.460 --> 22:11.030
Okay, um, you want to know the truth, Mr. Stokes?

22:11.100 --> 22:14.300
Uh... I was expecting a simple pickup,

22:14.360 --> 22:16.030
but you show up

22:16.100 --> 22:18.430
- with a small army here, and, um...  - And what?

22:18.500 --> 22:22.460
It's just... not w-what I was expecting, that's all.

22:22.530 --> 22:24.730
I just don't want to get caught.

22:24.800 --> 22:28.830
Nobody's gonna get caught, Carl.

22:28.900 --> 22:30.300
Let's go, we're moving.

22:30.360 --> 22:32.500
You too, Carl, take a ride.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.760
I told you, it's the fourth stack on your left.

22:34.830 --> 22:35.860
Q-block, row 36.

22:35.930 --> 22:36.960
I'd feel better if you showed us.

22:37.030 --> 22:38.760
I really should stay here, Mr. Stokes.

22:38.830 --> 22:40.130
I got to finish my patrol.

22:40.200 --> 22:41.200
Why, Carl?

22:41.260 --> 22:42.560
You expecting somebody?

22:42.630 --> 22:44.760
- No.  - Then get in.

22:47.160 --> 22:49.160
Okay.

22:55.400 --> 22:56.600
Damn it.

22:56.660 --> 22:59.060
Forget about him,Jack.

22:59.130 --> 23:01.130
He was dead the minute he stepped out that door.

23:01.200 --> 23:04.060
You and I both know that.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.030
Ethan, I just came to say how sorry I am.

23:25.100 --> 23:29.860
Well, I appreciate the courtesy if not the sincerity.

23:29.930 --> 23:34.630
As much as I may feel this is what's best for my mother,

23:34.700 --> 23:36.330
on a personal level

23:36.400 --> 23:38.730
I'm sorry you have to go through this...

23:38.800 --> 23:40.230
and for some of the harsher things

23:40.300 --> 23:44.160
I said to you in anger.

23:44.230 --> 23:46.730
Well, I suppose I owe you an apology, too,

23:46.800 --> 23:48.560
for accusing you

23:48.630 --> 23:51.960
of leaking my role in this Bauer fiasco

23:52.030 --> 23:53.560
to the press.

23:53.630 --> 23:56.260
I really believed you were trying to blindside me.

23:57.760 --> 23:59.900
Considering the impression I gave you, I'm not surprised.

24:00.930 --> 24:03.530
Olivia,

24:03.600 --> 24:06.660
as someone who's known you most of your life,

24:06.730 --> 24:08.660
I'd like to offer some advice.

24:08.730 --> 24:10.700
Of course.

24:15.430 --> 24:17.430
Ambition can be a valuable quality

24:17.500 --> 24:19.330
here in Washington

24:19.400 --> 24:22.260
as well as in life,

24:22.330 --> 24:26.860
but unchecked, it can be unhealthy, if not dangerous.

24:26.930 --> 24:29.360
What I'm trying to say is...

24:29.430 --> 24:33.230
you got yourself a seat at the president's table.

24:33.300 --> 24:36.300
She listens to you.

24:36.360 --> 24:39.560
But running a country is not like running

24:39.630 --> 24:41.530
a campaign.

24:41.600 --> 24:45.230
It's not about doing whatever it takes to win.

24:45.300 --> 24:48.730
It's about doing what's right for the American people.

24:50.760 --> 24:54.600
Sometimes those things aren't mutually exclusive.

25:01.300 --> 25:03.300
Well...

25:04.930 --> 25:06.860
good-bye, Olivia.

25:06.930 --> 25:08.930
Good-bye.

25:21.160 --> 25:23.100
Hello.

25:23.160 --> 25:24.500
It's Olivia.

25:24.560 --> 25:27.000
You can go with that story now, Ken, and it just got better.

25:27.060 --> 25:28.930
Tell me.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.860
Ethan Kanin's resigning.

25:30.930 --> 25:31.860
What happened?

25:31.930 --> 25:33.230
I thought the plan was to let him twist

25:33.300 --> 25:34.400
in the wind for a while.

25:34.460 --> 25:35.730
His hand was forced.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.260
It seems Jack Bauer just murdered

25:37.330 --> 25:39.760
Senator Mayer.

25:39.830 --> 25:41.160
What?

25:41.230 --> 25:43.330
You're kidding me.

25:43.400 --> 25:44.800
Anybody else have this yet?

25:44.860 --> 25:47.430
Not yet, it's all yours in time for the 11:00.

25:47.500 --> 25:49.300
Told you I'd take care of you, didn't I?

25:49.360 --> 25:50.660
You are too good to me, Olivia.

25:50.730 --> 25:53.330
You just hold up your end.

25:53.400 --> 25:55.330
Make sure Kanin's the fall guy.

25:55.400 --> 25:57.200
My mother is nowhere near this, understand?

25:57.260 --> 25:58.660
No problem.

25:58.730 --> 26:00.360
She really doesn't have any idea that you're the leak?

26:00.430 --> 26:02.660
No, and it'd better stay that way.

26:02.730 --> 26:06.530
She won't hear it from me.

26:06.600 --> 26:07.760
When are we having that dinner

26:07.830 --> 26:09.000
you promised?

26:09.060 --> 26:11.900
Maybe next week.

26:11.960 --> 26:13.160
It's always next week.

26:13.230 --> 26:14.230
You'd better get to work. 

26:14.250 --> 26:16.230
We are gonna make another broadcast.

26:32.700 --> 26:35.030
Preliminary ballistics.

26:35.100 --> 26:37.100
So these files on the computer...

26:37.160 --> 26:38.460
presumably Senator Mayer was looking

26:38.530 --> 26:39.700
at 'em before he was killed?

26:39.760 --> 26:40.700
Someone was, sir.

26:40.760 --> 26:41.700
They were opened and viewed

26:41.760 --> 26:43.230
within the last hour.

26:43.300 --> 26:45.530
So if the sen...

26:45.600 --> 26:49.060
if the senator was killed point-blank

26:49.130 --> 26:51.200
in the entry hall, how are we explaining the slugs

26:51.260 --> 26:53.230
in the door frame and the railing?

26:53.300 --> 26:54.400
I don't know, sir.

26:54.460 --> 26:56.300
Get the crime lab guys on it.

26:56.360 --> 26:58.360
Yes, sir.

27:11.800 --> 27:13.800
Agent Walker, it's Larry Moss for you.

27:15.730 --> 27:17.660
Hello.

27:17.730 --> 27:19.000
Senator Mayer is dead.

27:19.060 --> 27:21.700
Where's Jack?

27:21.760 --> 27:26.060
Don't know, we don't have him.

27:26.130 --> 27:28.460
Okay, but what, you think that he did this,Larry?

27:28.530 --> 27:29.530
First Burnett and now Mayer?

27:29.600 --> 27:31.000
Well...

27:31.060 --> 27:32.730
it looks that way.

27:32.800 --> 27:34.760
What do you mean "looks that way"?

27:34.830 --> 27:36.730
Well, that's why I'm calling. Senator Mayer

27:36.800 --> 27:38.830
was killed with a UMP 40 submachine gun.

27:38.900 --> 27:40.530
If Bauer was on the run,

27:40.600 --> 27:42.760
where'd he get ahold of a weapon like that?

27:42.830 --> 27:45.130
Also, there's evidence to suggest that the, uh...

27:45.200 --> 27:46.560
there was a third party in the house

27:46.630 --> 27:48.530
when the senator was killed. What kind of evidence?

27:48.600 --> 27:49.930
Unexplained slugs...

27:51.060 --> 27:53.100
... a broken set of French doors,

27:53.160 --> 27:54.530
a chair where it doesn't belong.

27:54.600 --> 27:56.230
Okay, so are you saying that this third party killed Mayer?

27:56.300 --> 27:57.400
Well, you know, Renee,

27:57.460 --> 27:59.300
I might be saying that if I knew what the hell

27:59.360 --> 28:02.400
Bauer was doing here in the first place.

28:02.460 --> 28:03.730
All right, Renee, listen.

28:03.800 --> 28:05.100
I want to meet you halfway, I do,

28:05.160 --> 28:06.860
but if you expect me to even entertain

28:06.930 --> 28:08.800
Bauer's innocence, you have got to help me here.

28:08.860 --> 28:09.800
I can't, Larry.

28:09.860 --> 28:11.230
If Jack is still underground,

28:11.300 --> 28:12.960
he is underground for a reason.

28:13.030 --> 28:15.530
There were files open on Mayer's computer...

28:15.600 --> 28:18.500
documents relating to his investigation into Starkwood.

28:18.560 --> 28:20.560
All right, so just tell me that, tell me that.

28:20.630 --> 28:23.830
Did Starkwood ever come up in your conversation with Bauer?

28:28.430 --> 28:31.600
Renee.

28:31.660 --> 28:36.100
Look, maybe, maybe I should have trusted you before,okay,

28:36.160 --> 28:39.730
but you have got to trust me now.

28:39.800 --> 28:42.860
What role does Starkwood play in all this?

28:49.200 --> 28:51.130
The man who framed Jack

28:51.200 --> 28:55.530
for Burnett's murder was John Quinn, a Starkwood contractor.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.300
Jack believes that they were behind Juma

28:57.360 --> 28:59.600
and all of the terrorist attacks today.

28:59.660 --> 29:01.960
He went to Mayer to get the evidence to prove it.

29:02.030 --> 29:05.360
I have to assume that Quinn followed him there.

29:05.430 --> 29:07.030
That's all that I know, Larry, I swear.

29:07.100 --> 29:09.600
Okay, I believe you.

29:09.660 --> 29:10.700
Thank you.

29:10.760 --> 29:13.530
Just sit tight, I'll be in touch soon.

29:13.600 --> 29:14.630
Well, let me help, Larry.

29:14.700 --> 29:15.860
I mean, Jack could still be out there.

29:15.930 --> 29:16.960
He may be in trouble.

29:17.030 --> 29:18.600
No, no, I can't release you, not yet.

29:33.860 --> 29:35.560
Reese, what's the status?

29:35.630 --> 29:37.200
Just getting the chassis on, sir, I'll be a minute.

29:37.260 --> 29:38.260
Hurry it up.

29:41.060 --> 29:43.700
Hold up, hold up, I don't have my truck.

29:43.760 --> 29:45.360
Put it down there, I want it there.

30:00.060 --> 30:01.560
Mitch, get up there.

30:01.630 --> 30:02.700
Let's run a diagnostic now.

30:02.760 --> 30:03.930
I want to be ready to roll

30:04.000 --> 30:05.660
as soon as Reese gets here with that flatbed.

30:05.730 --> 30:08.300
Yes, sir.

30:18.560 --> 30:20.260
All right, there's the package.

30:20.330 --> 30:21.700
We should get back to the car.

30:21.760 --> 30:23.230
We want to be in position to follow that container

30:23.300 --> 30:24.430
once they move out.

30:27.260 --> 30:29.600
Jack.

30:29.660 --> 30:32.400
Just give me one second.

30:32.460 --> 30:33.700
Cooper.

30:33.760 --> 30:35.360
Now's as good a time as any

30:35.430 --> 30:36.360
to settle up with Carl.

30:36.430 --> 30:38.200
Yes,sir.

30:38.260 --> 30:39.300
Thanks,Carl.

30:39.360 --> 30:41.800
Good luck.

30:41.860 --> 30:43.930
Let's go.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.500
Where we going?

30:45.560 --> 30:48.260
Your money's in my truck,just one aisle over.

30:52.430 --> 30:54.300
Jack,we should get going.

30:54.360 --> 30:55.430
No.

31:02.960 --> 31:04.930
What are you doing?

31:05.000 --> 31:05.930
I thought you said

31:06.000 --> 31:07.830
the money was in the truck.

31:10.160 --> 31:12.430
What the hell's going on?

31:12.500 --> 31:14.660
Just keep moving.

31:14.730 --> 31:17.860
Listen,I don't know what Stokes told you,

31:17.930 --> 31:19.300
but I didn't tell a soul.

31:22.500 --> 31:25.200
Damn it, Jack, what the hell are you doing?

31:25.260 --> 31:26.560
Don't do it.

31:26.630 --> 31:28.360
You're gonna turn a surveillance job into a firefight.

31:28.430 --> 31:29.800
It'll be two against ten.

31:29.860 --> 31:31.200
Two against nine.

31:31.260 --> 31:33.060
Right,and we lose our best chance

31:33.130 --> 31:34.700
at getting this weapon.

31:34.760 --> 31:35.730
Don't break your own rules.

31:35.800 --> 31:36.800
You may save one man,

31:36.860 --> 31:38.360
but what about the thousands of people

31:38.430 --> 31:39.800
who could die in a biological attack?

31:39.860 --> 31:42.900
Is this about you,Jack,or about them?

31:42.960 --> 31:44.460
You want to prevent another disaster

31:44.530 --> 31:46.560
or ensure that it's going to happen?

31:52.160 --> 31:53.830
That's far enough.

31:55.700 --> 31:56.730
Turn around.

31:58.760 --> 32:01.660
You're going to kill me,

32:01.730 --> 32:03.830
you're going to have to look me in the eye.

32:03.900 --> 32:05.960
Okay.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.030
Damn it.

32:12.060 --> 32:14.830
Thank you, thank you.

32:14.900 --> 32:16.400
We've got about 30 seconds

32:16.460 --> 32:17.900
before they figure out what happened.

32:17.960 --> 32:19.230
Okay, what's our fallback?

32:19.300 --> 32:21.230
- Steal the truck.  - Strong?

32:21.300 --> 32:23.400
I'll make the direct assault, you cover the east flank.

32:23.460 --> 32:25.030
All we need is a big enough firefight

32:25.100 --> 32:26.360
to get one of us behind the wheel.

32:26.430 --> 32:27.560
- You ready?  - Yeah.

32:27.630 --> 32:29.730
Go.

32:32.930 --> 32:34.830
How do we look?

32:35.900 --> 32:38.530
Gnostics check out, sir.

32:38.560 --> 32:39.630
The package is stable.

32:40.600 --> 32:42.800
Good.

32:42.860 --> 32:45.900
All right, let's get her on the chassis!

33:04.060 --> 33:05.030
Cooper, come on.

33:05.100 --> 33:07.230
Let's roll.

33:07.300 --> 33:09.130
Cooper, do you copy?

33:17.460 --> 33:18.730
Dolen.

33:18.800 --> 33:19.830
Check the next aisle over.

33:19.900 --> 33:21.730
Find Cooper.

33:26.260 --> 33:27.330
Hold your position.

33:27.400 --> 33:28.560
Wait for my signal.

33:34.260 --> 33:35.460
Cooper's down, Cooper's down.

33:35.530 --> 33:36.630
Go red, go red!

33:36.700 --> 33:38.230
Let's move out... Greer.

33:38.300 --> 33:40.200
Engage... engage.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.760
Reese, get the truck out of here now!

34:36.830 --> 34:38.929
Go, go, go!

34:39.000 --> 34:40.030
Tony!

34:40.100 --> 34:41.400
The truck... I'm going after it.

34:41.460 --> 34:42.530
Cover me now!

35:12.660 --> 35:16.660
Two shooters... fan out and find them.

35:48.060 --> 35:50.100
Tony, this is Jack... do you copy?

36:05.030 --> 36:06.230
Drop it.

36:11.260 --> 36:12.400
Tony?

36:12.460 --> 36:13.960
I know you.

36:15.660 --> 36:17.630
You're on Emerson's crew.

36:17.700 --> 36:19.730
You're Almeida, right?

36:24.830 --> 36:26.100
I know Bauer's with you. Now where is he?

36:53.030 --> 36:54.900
Larry Moss.

36:54.960 --> 36:57.330
- Larry, it's Jack.  - Jack, where the hell have you been?

36:57.400 --> 36:59.060
I need you to scramble multiple teams

36:59.130 --> 37:01.500
to a weigh station on Highway 236, exit 29.

37:01.560 --> 37:03.760
I'm in a big rig about ten miles south.

37:03.830 --> 37:04.930
What's going on?

37:05.000 --> 37:06.760
You also need to send a CDC recovery unit.

37:06.830 --> 37:07.900
Why?

37:07.960 --> 37:09.400
I'm in possession of a biological weapon

37:09.460 --> 37:10.960
interdicted at the Port of Alexandria.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.100
A biological weapon?

37:13.160 --> 37:14.100
Larry, just listen to me.

37:14.160 --> 37:15.230
I don't care if you arrest me.

37:15.300 --> 37:16.360
I don't care if you shoot me.

37:16.430 --> 37:18.300
Just get your teams out here.

37:18.360 --> 37:20.660
I fully expect to be pursued by hostiles.

37:20.730 --> 37:21.900
Starkwood?

37:22.000 --> 37:23.330
How do you know about Starkwood?

37:23.400 --> 37:24.530
I talked to Renee.

37:24.600 --> 37:26.030
And I saw what was on Mayer's computer.

37:26.100 --> 37:27.560
Larry, they're coming after this weapon.

37:27.630 --> 37:28.830
You can count on it.

37:28.900 --> 37:30.130
Now, be advised, I believe

37:30.200 --> 37:32.060
that Tony Almeida is being held hostage.

37:32.130 --> 37:34.700
All right, I'll call out an interagency alert.

37:34.760 --> 37:35.700
We'll secure both locations.

37:35.760 --> 37:36.730
Larry, hurry.

40:41.530 --> 40:43.500
Damn it!

40:55.100 --> 40:56.430
Sir, this is Stokes.

40:56.500 --> 40:57.960
What's your status?

40:58.030 --> 40:59.930
The package is secure... we're inbound.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.500
What about Bauer?

41:01.560 --> 41:02.960
He's at the scene, sir,

41:03.030 --> 41:04.500
but he sought cover nearby.

41:04.560 --> 41:06.100
Well, we have to assume

41:06.160 --> 41:08.060
that he contacted the authorities,

41:08.130 --> 41:11.160
so we better be on an accelerated timetable.

41:11.230 --> 41:12.400
Get over here.

41:12.460 --> 41:13.930
It will be there in ten minutes.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
We're right behind.

41:15.060 --> 41:16.100
Good.

41:17.730 --> 41:20.960
I've got teams on the ground prepping for your arrival.

41:26.030 --> 41:27.060
Larry Moss.

41:27.130 --> 41:28.230
Larry, it's Jack.

41:28.300 --> 41:29.960
I'm still on Route 236,

41:30.030 --> 41:31.860
but I had to stop approximately seven miles

41:31.930 --> 41:33.330
before the weigh station.

41:33.400 --> 41:35.260
Jack, I got two units moving to you right now.

41:35.330 --> 41:37.060
Yeah, well, you're gonna have to redirect them.

41:37.130 --> 41:38.060
Why?

41:38.130 --> 41:39.800
Starkwood reacquired the bioweapon.

41:39.860 --> 41:41.000
They managed to access

41:41.060 --> 41:42.600
one of the dock's freight helicopters.

41:42.660 --> 41:45.260
While they had me pinned down, they airlifted the freight

41:45.330 --> 41:46.600
right out of here.

41:46.660 --> 41:48.500
They were headed due west from my current position.

41:48.560 --> 41:50.700
West... they got a large military facility

41:50.760 --> 41:51.800
in that area.

41:51.860 --> 41:53.160
Okay, good... redirect the teams there.

41:53.230 --> 41:54.900
Jack, I can't assault a private compound

41:54.960 --> 41:56.260
unless I have proof

41:56.330 --> 41:57.260
that a weapon exists.

41:57.330 --> 41:58.460
Okay, where's the CDC?

41:58.530 --> 42:00.030
They're scrambling a team right now.

42:00.100 --> 42:01.760
Send them to me.

42:01.830 --> 42:03.260
You'll have all the proof you need.

42:03.330 --> 42:04.500
Jack, what happened?

42:05.760 --> 42:07.100
One of the canisters was breached

42:07.160 --> 42:08.160
during the interdiction.

42:08.230 --> 42:11.130
Some of the bio-agent was released.

42:11.200 --> 42:13.000
I...

42:13.060 --> 42:14.560
I was exposed.

42:16.700 --> 42:17.800
Okay.

42:17.860 --> 42:19.300
Jack, just sit right.

42:19.360 --> 42:20.800
CDC's on the way.

42:20.860 --> 42:22.430
They're going to be there soon.

00:00.500 --> 00:13.000
