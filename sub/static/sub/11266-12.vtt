because I'm in
love with you.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.664
Cannon did not reject me.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.840
Um, the one from Kansas.

11:13.881 --> 11:16.468
Her mom's in rehab, so I think

11:16.510 --> 11:18.470
I'm going to be
pretty busy with her.

11:19.638 --> 11:20.847
Uh... okay.

11:20.888 --> 11:23.099
Then, no problem.

11:23.141 --> 11:25.602
I'll call you, okay?

11:25.644 --> 11:27.604
♪ ♪

11:27.646 --> 11:30.231
Okay.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.949
(sighs)

11:39.991 --> 11:41.784
Uh... so Ade's in the middle

11:41.826 --> 11:43.453
of a crisis, and uh...

11:43.495 --> 11:45.163
I couldn't break up with her.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.165
But as-as soon as
things calm down...

11:47.207 --> 11:48.791
I'm going to do it.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.669
Anyway, uh,

11:50.709 --> 11:52.170
I hope Naomi's okay.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.421
Miss you.

11:53.463 --> 11:54.548
Hey!

11:54.589 --> 11:56.007
Hey!
What's up?

11:56.049 --> 11:57.551
Um...

11:57.592 --> 11:59.010
C-can...

11:59.052 --> 12:00.845
Can a guy kiss a guy

12:00.887 --> 12:02.347
and not be gay?

12:02.389 --> 12:04.098
Persian guys do.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.225
Oh, especially
if they're related.

12:05.266 --> 12:06.643
It's a cultural thing.

12:06.685 --> 12:07.935
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.021
Um... but wh-what if

12:10.063 --> 12:12.023
the two dudes aren't Persian,

12:12.065 --> 12:13.567
or related,

12:13.608 --> 12:15.734
and... they kiss on the mouth?

12:15.776 --> 12:17.736
What are you
talking about, dude?

12:17.778 --> 12:19.322
Hey... Teddy!

12:19.364 --> 12:20.365
Uh, wait. I
think Dixon's,

12:20.407 --> 12:21.740
uh, trying
to come
on to me.

12:21.782 --> 12:22.825
He's hinting around
like he wants to...

12:22.867 --> 12:23.868
make out.
Shut up,

12:23.910 --> 12:25.161
dude, shut up.

12:25.203 --> 12:26.246
What? About you
hitting on me?

12:26.287 --> 12:28.873
You're an idiot, okay? Um...

12:28.915 --> 12:30.166
I-I was just... talking about

12:30.208 --> 12:32.335
something I-I... I saw

12:32.377 --> 12:33.587
in a movie.
At the

12:33.628 --> 12:34.879
West Hollywood Film Festival?

12:36.047 --> 12:38.841
Well, catch you guys tomorrow.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.051
Hey, you're smart
to run, bro,

12:40.093 --> 12:41.760
before Dixon starts
putting the moves on you.

12:41.802 --> 12:45.056
Later!

12:45.098 --> 12:45.973
(zany grunt)

12:47.559 --> 12:48.476
Let me buy you some cider.

12:49.644 --> 12:50.811
I was never raped.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.440
Everything I said

12:53.481 --> 12:55.108
about Mr. Cannon was a lie.

12:55.149 --> 12:58.236
I... tried to seduce him...

12:58.278 --> 13:00.405
because I had a crush on him.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.907
And when he rejected me,

13:02.949 --> 13:05.076
I couldn't handle it.

13:05.118 --> 13:08.580
So I got Silver to help me,
to get revenge.

13:09.748 --> 13:11.625
Um...

13:11.666 --> 13:13.876
what we did was

13:13.918 --> 13:15.253
incredibly stupid
and wrong

13:15.295 --> 13:18.339
and we destroyed
an innocent man's life.

13:18.381 --> 13:20.091
We're sorry.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.678
Please
forgive us.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.723
And let Mr. Cannon go free.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.519
(whispering):
Thank you.

13:32.771 --> 13:35.482
I appreciate you
telling the truth, finally.

13:38.652 --> 13:39.569
Good.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.947
Before I go, I need money.

13:42.989 --> 13:45.283
I think I have a few
hundred in my purse,

13:45.325 --> 13:46.534
and probably some
more in the safe.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.453
Don't screw with me.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.580
I need, uh,

13:50.622 --> 13:52.791
enough money to live on
until my name's cleared.

13:52.831 --> 13:54.250
You have a trust fund;

13:54.292 --> 13:57.295
I want it. Tell me how to
log on to your accounts.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.964
Give me your password, I'll
make a transfer, and then...

14:00.006 --> 14:02.216
and then we'll
be done here.
I can't.

14:02.258 --> 14:04.260
I can't do
it online.

14:04.302 --> 14:05.637
Transactions over five grand

14:05.679 --> 14:06.971
have to be made in person.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.641
Don't you lie to me!
I'm not!

14:09.683 --> 14:10.975
I'm not.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.477
My online
shopping

14:12.519 --> 14:14.479
was getting a little out of
hand, and my business manager

14:14.521 --> 14:16.272
set it up so that I can't
make impulsive purchases.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.818
I can't.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.238
You have no self-control.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.824
You know that?

14:25.865 --> 14:28.451
(whispers):
Bloody hell.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.996
Okay.

14:34.165 --> 14:36.835
We'll go to the bank together.

14:36.876 --> 14:41.047
I guess we'll just have to
wait until morning.

14:53.810 --> 14:54.728
Hey.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.857
Hey.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.650
Just thought I'd get

15:00.692 --> 15:02.068
another practice in
before the meet.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.029
Me, too.

15:08.783 --> 15:10.201
I'm going to go in the water.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.328
Look, Dixon...

15:12.370 --> 15:14.038
I'm sorry.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.499
Okay? I'm sorry for what I did.

15:17.667 --> 15:18.668

She'll be all right.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.883
I'd be freaking out.

18:11.925 --> 18:15.678
Yeah, but you freak out
over hairless dogs.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.471
Eww, yeah,
'cause they're gross!

18:17.513 --> 18:19.098
That skin? Ugh!

18:20.266 --> 18:22.018
Oh!

18:22.060 --> 18:23.770
What's with this
bed, anyway?

18:23.811 --> 18:26.230
Oh, you mean the bed
that I'm trying to make?

18:26.272 --> 18:28.232
(laughs)
Yeah.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.735
Cousin Emily gets in today.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.111
Any minute.
Wow.

18:32.152 --> 18:33.195
You seem psyched.

18:33.237 --> 18:34.697
I know I'm going to be the one

18:34.739 --> 18:36.240
who gets stuck being
her babysitter,

18:36.282 --> 18:39.452
and tour guide, and roommate
for the next five months.

18:39.493 --> 18:40.745
All right, look.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.789
Maybe she's changed,
okay? Maybe she's...

18:42.830 --> 18:44.415
less annoying than
she used to be.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.917
(sighs) Yeah.

18:57.095 --> 18:58.554
(shrieks)

18:58.596 --> 19:00.598
I'm here!
I'm really here!

19:00.640 --> 19:01.975
You're really here.

19:02.016 --> 19:04.978
(shrieking)

19:05.812 --> 19:07.187
Oh...! Hi, Dixon.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.689
Hey, Emily.

19:08.731 --> 19:11.776
We are going to have the best
time together, aren't we?

19:11.818 --> 19:12.902
We sure are!

19:12.944 --> 19:16.072
(shrieks)

19:16.114 --> 19:19.241
You can't imagine the horror
of having someone

19:19.283 --> 19:23.121
so close to you die
in your arms.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.123
Can you simplify
that, verbally?

19:25.164 --> 19:27.041
Try, "To have someone

19:27.083 --> 19:29.335
die in my arms
was horrifying."

19:29.376 --> 19:31.337
"Horrible" or "horrifying"?
Which sounds better?

19:31.378 --> 19:32.964
Um...
Never mind.

19:33.006 --> 19:33.965
Go with "horrible."

19:34.007 --> 19:36.300
Okay. "To have someone
that close to me...

19:36.342 --> 19:38.845
"die in my arms...

19:38.886 --> 19:40.429
It was horrible."
Good.

19:40.471 --> 19:42.056
You know that he didn't actually

19:42.098 --> 19:43.641
die in my arms, right?
Luckily for us,

19:43.683 --> 19:45.643
he's not available for comment.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.521
Okay. Uh, then I go
into the part about having PSTD?

19:48.562 --> 19:50.523
P-T-S-D. Geez.

19:50.564 --> 19:51.816
Whether or not
you have PSTD

19:51.858 --> 19:53.818
is between you and
your gynecologist,

19:53.860 --> 19:54.902
and Navid...

19:56.362 --> 19:57.989
Okay. So, "die
in your arms"...

19:58.031 --> 19:59.657
"post-traumatic
stress disorder."

19:59.699 --> 20:01.492
Okay. Should I cry?
Oh...

20:01.534 --> 20:02.785
you can mist up. No bawling.

20:02.827 --> 20:04.162
(knock on door)
Hello.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.371
How are we doing?

20:05.412 --> 20:08.666
(women squealing)
Renee, so good
to see you.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.001
You look amazing.

20:10.043 --> 20:11.335
Raw foods.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.004
I am throwing
out my stove.

20:13.046 --> 20:14.505
Lindsay Austin,

20:14.547 --> 20:15.506
Hi!

20:15.548 --> 20:16.841
Hi...

20:16.883 --> 20:18.509
Relax.

20:18.551 --> 20:19.510
Just be yourself.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.345
Okay? Tell your story.

20:21.387 --> 20:24.015
It's all going to
be just fine.
Yeah.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.892
I hope you're right.
I'll see you

20:25.933 --> 20:27.185
out there.... Okay.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.102
(giggles)

20:29.562 --> 20:31.939
So... Ready, Addy?

20:31.981 --> 20:33.232
Yeah, I'm ready.

20:33.273 --> 20:34.692
Mm.

20:34.734 --> 20:35.818
Mmm.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.031
Wish me luck.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.074
Yeah.

20:41.115 --> 20:42.282
Break a leg.

20:46.286 --> 20:48.247
(sighs)

20:53.586 --> 20:54.461
(cell phone beeps)

20:56.089 --> 20:57.548
Hey. So, uh...

20:57.590 --> 21:00.300
looks like Ade will be out of
the... woods pretty soon.

21:00.342 --> 21:02.720
Um...
call you after I talk to her.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.430
Hope you're having
a good morning.

21:04.471 --> 21:06.224
Bye.

21:07.391 --> 21:09.602
(sighs) OMG. Katy Perry

21:09.643 --> 21:11.062
and Ben Affleck are

21:11.104 --> 21:12.188
next-door neighbors!

21:12.230 --> 21:14.314
How cool must their
block parties be?

21:14.356 --> 21:16.943
Oddly, they
never invite me.
Oh!

21:16.984 --> 21:18.778
Going out! Bye!
Hey, Annie.
Wait!

21:18.819 --> 21:22.740
Did you know that you live
less than half a mile away

21:22.782 --> 21:24.784
from Julia Roberts'
brother Eric Roberts--

21:24.825 --> 21:26.077
father of Emma Roberts?

21:26.119 --> 21:28.955
I had no idea!
Where are you going?

21:28.996 --> 21:30.497
Uh, just to return a shirt.

21:30.539 --> 21:31.916
In Beverly Hills?

21:31.958 --> 21:34.460
Oh, that sounds amazing! You
know, I always wanted to know

21:34.501 --> 21:36.921
if those salespeople there
really are as snobby

21:36.963 --> 21:38.131
as they were in Pretty Woman.

21:38.172 --> 21:39.632
Gosh, I wonder

21:39.673 --> 21:41.926
where Richard Gere lives.
In a mansion,

21:41.968 --> 21:43.136
no doubt.

21:49.433 --> 21:52.519
Emily, um, you...
you wouldn't want

21:52.561 --> 21:53.562
to come... with...

21:53.604 --> 21:55.481
I'll grab my purse!

21:55.522 --> 21:56.482
ANNIE:
Okay, great.

21:56.523 --> 21:58.317
(giggles)

22:03.322 --> 22:04.157
(gasps)

22:05.783 --> 22:07.534
What are you doing?

22:11.956 --> 22:13.124
Right...

22:13.166 --> 22:14.959
We're going
to the bank.

22:15.001 --> 22:17.253
Naomi, you're driving.

22:17.295 --> 22:19.255
Silver waits with me.

22:19.297 --> 22:22.466
You try anything,
and she's dead.

22:22.508 --> 22:23.383
Let's go.

22:30.348 --> 22:32.101
Wait. Can I
fix my makeup?

22:32.143 --> 22:33.811
Naomi.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.646
What, you want to look hot
for the bank teller?

22:35.688 --> 22:38.774
Once a slut,
always a slut, huh?

22:38.816 --> 22:40.526
If they see me looking
like this,

22:40.567 --> 22:42.069
they'll know something's wrong.

22:43.821 --> 22:45.698
Okay. Go on, then.

22:52.997 --> 22:54.832
Cosmetics...

22:54.874 --> 22:56.709
The tools of feminine deception.

22:59.670 --> 23:01.547
Your cheeks
aren't that pink,

23:01.588 --> 23:03.257
your lips
aren't that red,

23:03.299 --> 23:04.842
and your eyelashes
aren't that long.

23:04.884 --> 23:08.512
It's all a lie.
You're such a liar.

23:08.554 --> 23:09.763
(screaming)

23:11.015 --> 23:12.183
(groaning)

23:20.941 --> 23:23.069

went shopping on Rodeo Drive.

23:23.110 --> 23:24.528
That's, like, by far
the coolest thing

23:24.570 --> 23:25.946
I've ever done in
my entire life.

23:25.988 --> 23:27.281
Well, I'm glad
you had fun.

23:27.323 --> 23:29.742
Do you really think that was
Lauren Conrad we saw in Barneys?

23:29.783 --> 23:31.618
No. Like I said,
I don't think it was.

23:31.660 --> 23:32.745
Oh, my gosh.

23:32.786 --> 23:35.039

movie star, right?

23:36.207 --> 23:38.376
Hi. You must be Emily.

23:38.416 --> 23:40.378
I must be.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.340
I mean, I...
I am. I am. Hi.
Mm-hmm.

23:44.382 --> 23:45.883
Hi.

Emily, Liam.
Hello. Hi.

23:48.468 --> 23:49.803
Hi.
Hi.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.347
Hello.

Hello.

All right.

Hey. Um, did you
clear your head yet?

23:57.435 --> 23:59.272
I'm still thinking.

24:01.815 --> 24:03.650
Okay.

24:05.152 --> 24:07.029
I'm just going
to check out the surf meet.

24:07.071 --> 24:08.281
I'll see you later.

24:08.322 --> 24:09.949
Nice to meet you, Emily.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.742
(hushed laughing)

24:11.784 --> 24:13.286
OMG!

24:13.327 --> 24:15.955
That's, like, the cutest
boy I have ever seen.

24:19.457 --> 24:22.336
I totally get why you're
so H-over-H for him.

24:22.378 --> 24:24.546
I am not H-over-H.

24:24.588 --> 24:26.173
Where do you
even get that?

24:26.215 --> 24:27.633
Okay, so watching
the sparks

24:27.674 --> 24:30.594
between you two is like
the Fourth of July.

24:30.636 --> 24:32.638
Yeah, well,
that doesn't make him

24:32.679 --> 24:34.556
any more right for me.

24:34.598 --> 24:35.891
Why?

24:35.933 --> 24:37.393
Is he a bad boy?

24:37.435 --> 24:38.644
Something like that.

24:38.685 --> 24:40.062
It's complicated.

24:40.104 --> 24:44.275
Um, I'm dating his
brother, Charlie.

24:44.317 --> 24:46.484
Oh. That's intense.

24:46.526 --> 24:49.571
Yeah. And-and he's
a really awesome guy.

24:49.613 --> 24:50.948
(sighs)

24:50.990 --> 24:53.284
That sounds just like
a Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt,

24:53.326 --> 24:55.411
Angelina Jolie love triangle.

24:55.453 --> 24:56.954
It does?
Exactly.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.831
Brad and Jen
were America's sweethearts

24:58.872 --> 25:00.582
before Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith,

25:00.624 --> 25:03.627
Okay.
where Angelina
ignited his passion.

25:03.669 --> 25:06.380
You know, people said she
was wild and dangerous.

25:06.422 --> 25:09.675
You know, they said she had
this tattoo near her privates

25:09.716 --> 25:12.594
and wore some other guy's
blood around her neck.

25:12.636 --> 25:14.013
(sighs)
Look at them now.

25:14.054 --> 25:15.389
They're Brangelina,

25:15.431 --> 25:17.850
one of the ten happiest
couples in Hollywood,

25:17.891 --> 25:20.311
and Jen can't get a second date.

25:20.353 --> 25:22.021
Okay. I think I follow.

25:22.062 --> 25:24.106
I think you just need
to stop being a scaredy-cat

25:24.148 --> 25:25.232
with your true feelings.

25:25.274 --> 25:26.484
You know, it's obvious

25:26.524 --> 25:27.901
that you and Liam
belong together.

25:29.862 --> 25:32.865
Strangely enough,
that makes sense.

25:32.906 --> 25:34.492

Thank you.

25:34.532 --> 25:35.659
You're welcome.

ADRIANNA:
To have someone
that close to me

25:40.498 --> 25:44.168
die in my arms...
it was horrible.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.752
Apparently, it triggered

25:45.794 --> 25:48.214
what they call
post-traumatic stress disorder.

25:48.255 --> 25:51.133
Of course, I didn't
know that at the time.

25:51.175 --> 25:54.845
All I knew was,
everything was this haze.

25:54.887 --> 25:57.056
You know, I...
I couldn't think clearly.

25:57.097 --> 26:00.017
And so, when you took
Javier's notebook,

26:00.059 --> 26:01.394
you were in that state?

26:01.435 --> 26:02.560
That haze?

26:02.602 --> 26:03.729
Exactly.

26:03.770 --> 26:05.856
And I feel awful
about it.

26:05.898 --> 26:08.526
But I just...
I couldn't think straight.

26:08.566 --> 26:11.153
You know, I...
I wasn't myself.

26:11.195 --> 26:12.863
And when did you come out of it?

26:16.242 --> 26:18.244
Um, out of it?

26:18.285 --> 26:20.913
The state of shock. The PTSD.

26:20.954 --> 26:23.499
Was it before or
after you decided

26:23.541 --> 26:26.419
to record an entire album
of stolen material?

26:27.836 --> 26:29.296
Well, uh, PSTD...

26:29.338 --> 26:31.631
I mean, uh, PTSD...

26:31.673 --> 26:34.885

26:37.179 --> 26:38.431
Was it before
or after

26:38.472 --> 26:40.015

33:39.142 --> 33:42.145
(sobbing): Please,
please, please, please.

33:42.187 --> 33:43.647
Beg, you dog.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.315
I'm begging you, please!

33:45.357 --> 33:46.483
Naomi!

33:46.525 --> 33:47.609
He deserves

33:47.651 --> 33:49.110
to die.

33:49.152 --> 33:50.153
Don't!

33:50.195 --> 33:51.655
I'll do anything.

33:51.697 --> 33:53.824
Shut up!

33:53.866 --> 33:55.993
I know he deserves
to die, but...

33:56.034 --> 33:57.661
You're not going
to kill anybody.

33:57.703 --> 34:00.664
Not even him.

34:00.706 --> 34:04.209
Naomi, if you do this,
your life is over.

34:05.752 --> 34:08.295
He's not worth it.

34:08.338 --> 34:11.049
He's not
worth it.

34:11.090 --> 34:12.759
Save your own life.

34:22.811 --> 34:26.188
(whimpering)

34:26.231 --> 34:28.942
(sobbing)

34:40.036 --> 34:42.539
Okay, well,
it was a mistake.

34:42.581 --> 34:43.748
All right? I didn't
mean to hurt anybody.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.123
I didn't mean to do it.

34:45.166 --> 34:46.877
LINDSAY:
Okay, just take it easy.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.962
(sniffles)

34:49.004 --> 34:52.049
Hopefully, our next
guest will be able to
help clear things up.

34:52.090 --> 34:55.552
Please welcome Javier's uncle
and lifelong manager--

34:55.594 --> 34:56.553
Victor Luna.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.471
Thank you.

34:58.513 --> 35:00.223
Thank you for having me.

35:00.265 --> 35:03.018
Why don't you
start out

35:03.060 --> 35:05.353
by telling us about your
relationship with Adrianna?

35:05.395 --> 35:08.815
Well, she did this
amazing musical number

35:08.857 --> 35:10.108
at Javier's memorial.

35:10.149 --> 35:13.152
And frankly, I was surprised
that she had it in her.

35:13.194 --> 35:17.240
So she comes to me and she asks
me if I would be her manager.

35:17.282 --> 35:19.743
So I check out
her new material

35:19.785 --> 35:20.953
and it's incredible.

35:20.994 --> 35:23.580
It's as if she was
channeling Javier.

35:23.622 --> 35:26.165
And of course, now I know why.

35:26.207 --> 35:27.250
He's lying, okay?

35:27.292 --> 35:28.877
He knew about the
notebook all along.

35:28.919 --> 35:29.920
He blackmailed me!

35:29.962 --> 35:32.255
Stop finger-pointing,
and just admit

35:32.297 --> 35:33.882
this was all
your doing.

35:33.924 --> 35:36.551
Adrianna, Javier's fans
deserve better.

35:36.593 --> 35:39.220
I can't do this.

35:39.262 --> 35:40.764
(sniffles)

35:45.310 --> 35:47.145
Victor, I think we're
just all dying to know...

35:47.186 --> 35:48.939
ADRIANNA:
They ambushed me.

35:48.981 --> 35:50.816
It was horrible.

35:50.857 --> 35:52.859
Renee left me.
Everybody hates me.

35:52.901 --> 35:54.444
(blowing nose)

35:54.486 --> 35:55.862
(Victor speaking
indistinctly)

35:55.904 --> 35:58.031
Thank God I have you.

36:00.075 --> 36:02.494
Oh, my God.

36:04.621 --> 36:06.873
Annie, have
you seen my...?

36:06.915 --> 36:09.459
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
I thought you were Annie.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.086
No problem.
Annie's amazing.

36:11.128 --> 36:13.296
She said I could borrow
anything I wanted.

36:13.338 --> 36:15.757
Oh, I'm glad you two
are getting along.

36:19.845 --> 36:21.513
(sighs)

36:30.605 --> 36:32.149
Hey, guys,
third place
isn't bad.

36:32.231 --> 36:35.902
It's not awesome,
but it doesn't suck.

36:35.944 --> 36:38.113
All right, I'll see you
guys next week, okay?

36:39.906 --> 36:42.742
Dixon, you were--
you were killing it
out there today, buddy.

36:42.784 --> 36:44.161
Yeah.

36:46.746 --> 36:49.374
Yeah, I think I'm going
to head out of here.

36:49.415 --> 36:50.542
How's the leg?

36:50.583 --> 36:51.918
It blows.

36:51.960 --> 36:53.920
Later.
Later.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.425
TEDDY:
Hey, Dixon!

37:02.470 --> 37:04.097
Hey, you going back out?

37:04.139 --> 37:05.765
If so, I might
stick around.

37:05.807 --> 37:08.601
Um... No, um, maybe.

37:08.643 --> 37:10.603
Um...

37:10.645 --> 37:13.356
I'm-I'm not sure yet.

37:13.398 --> 37:14.941
Is there something wrong?

37:14.983 --> 37:16.151
No. Why?

37:16.193 --> 37:17.569
I don't know,

37:17.610 --> 37:18.945
you're just acting
kind of weird.

37:18.987 --> 37:21.614
Look who's talking.

37:23.282 --> 37:24.868
What's that supposed to mean?

37:29.122 --> 37:30.916
Look, dude, I think
you already know.

37:34.836 --> 37:36.963
Nope. No idea.

37:39.132 --> 37:41.801
I saw you kissing Ian
last night at Adrianna's.

37:41.843 --> 37:44.596
Good one. Very funny.

37:44.637 --> 37:47.974
I don't know whether you were
drunk or-or high

37:48.016 --> 37:50.476
or whatever, but
I know what I saw.

37:50.518 --> 37:52.645
Maybe you were high or drunk,
because it wasn't me.

37:52.687 --> 37:53.605
I was completely sober.

38:01.821 --> 38:03.823
Fine.

38:08.369 --> 38:10.956
Look, I...

38:10.997 --> 38:12.540
Are you-- are you gay?

38:18.588 --> 38:20.673
Look... look, I don't want
to talk about it.

38:20.715 --> 38:21.925
Just please,

38:21.967 --> 38:24.177
just don't say anything
about what you saw.

38:24.219 --> 38:26.054
Man, I am begging you.
Please.

38:32.018 --> 38:33.311
Okay.

38:33.352 --> 38:35.814
Fine. Cool.

38:43.404 --> 38:45.282
♪ ♪

38:58.419 --> 39:00.297
(engine starts)

39:02.715 --> 39:04.383
There you are.

39:04.425 --> 39:06.552
I thought we were
meeting out front.

39:06.594 --> 39:08.180
Oh.

39:08.221 --> 39:12.017
Look, Liam, I'm sorry
that I made you wait.

39:12.058 --> 39:14.894
I just-- I had a lot
to sort out.

39:14.936 --> 39:18.231
But... it's you, Liam.

39:18.273 --> 39:20.900
I want to be with you.

39:20.942 --> 39:22.902
More than you can even imagine.

39:22.944 --> 39:24.904
So I'm going to break up
with Charlie...

39:24.946 --> 39:26.239
Don't.

39:26.281 --> 39:28.574
Don't do that.

39:28.616 --> 39:32.245
I don't understand.

39:32.287 --> 39:34.206
What's going on?

39:34.247 --> 39:35.707
Charlie came to see me today.

39:35.748 --> 39:36.958
Oh, my God.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.918
Did you tell
him about...?
No, no, no.

39:38.960 --> 39:40.253
But-But we talked.

39:40.295 --> 39:42.839
For the first time in
years, we really talked.

39:44.299 --> 39:46.301
I was wrong about him.

39:46.343 --> 39:48.761
About everything.

39:48.803 --> 39:51.597
I screwed up, and I want
to make things right, you know.

39:51.639 --> 39:53.766
He didn't deserve it--
the way I treated him.

39:53.808 --> 39:58.104
I finally have
my brother back.

39:58.146 --> 40:00.023
I have family.

40:03.609 --> 40:06.654
If we got together,
it would ruin that.

40:10.325 --> 40:12.493
I'm sorry.

40:15.454 --> 40:17.415
(garbled radio transmission)

40:17.456 --> 40:19.417
Thank you.
We'll be in touch.

40:19.458 --> 40:21.253
Get him out of here.
