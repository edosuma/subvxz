Morning, Peter.
Morning, Lois.

00:40.073 --> 00:41.339
You using
the bathroom?

00:41.341 --> 00:42.207
Yeah. Why?

00:42.209 --> 00:42.974
I was just curious.

00:42.976 --> 00:45.143
Before you go,
I wanna ask you
a question.

00:45.145 --> 00:46.411
Is there something
on my elbow?

00:46.413 --> 00:48.213
Me first, me first,
me first!

00:48.215 --> 00:49.881
(both grunting)

00:54.320 --> 00:55.720
Peter, I'm going first.

00:55.722 --> 00:56.421
Oh, no, you don't!

00:56.423 --> 00:57.956
Move your ass, Peter!
You move yours!

00:57.958 --> 01:00.358
I made reservations
with the maitre d'.

01:00.360 --> 01:01.793
Isn't that right,
Cornelius?

01:01.795 --> 01:03.261
Lois Griffin,
poop for one.

01:03.263 --> 01:04.295
I also need a poop.

01:04.297 --> 01:05.397
Do you have
a reservation, sir?

01:05.399 --> 01:07.232
Yeah, I called
a couple days ago.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.466
Who did you
speak to?

01:08.468 --> 01:11.503
Dave... ald... Jeff

01:11.505 --> 01:14.139
illiam... tonio?

01:14.141 --> 01:17.475
Davaldjeffilliamtonio
hasn't worked here
for four years.

01:17.477 --> 01:21.312
Ah, the hell with you.
I'll use the other bathroom.

01:21.314 --> 01:23.348
MALE VOICE:
Somebody's in here.

01:24.417 --> 01:25.884
Oh, excuse me.

01:25.886 --> 01:27.052
Good morning.

01:27.054 --> 01:29.654
Lois, since when does
an elephant live here?

01:29.656 --> 01:33.091
He's an exchange student.
Don't you remember?

01:33.093 --> 01:34.225
Oh, that's right.

01:34.227 --> 01:35.427
Don't you feel foolish?

01:35.429 --> 01:37.462
Well, how long
does it usually take you?

01:37.464 --> 01:38.463
I don't remember.

01:38.465 --> 01:39.497
(to himself):
Oh, my God,

01:39.499 --> 01:40.432
that is such
a bunch of crap.

01:40.434 --> 01:43.535
I hope my son is having
a better time with your family.

01:43.537 --> 01:46.304
(screams)
Poachers!

01:48.340 --> 01:52.077
(whimpering)

01:52.144 --> 01:53.978
Joe, I need
to use your bathroom.

01:53.980 --> 01:55.413
Sure, Peter.

01:58.551 --> 01:59.851
What the hell?

01:59.853 --> 02:01.319
How do you even?

02:01.321 --> 02:03.154
Wha...? It...

02:03.156 --> 02:04.889
I-I don't...

02:04.891 --> 02:06.157
Wait. How do I...?

02:06.159 --> 02:07.325
Uh, yeah,
that's gonna be

02:07.327 --> 02:08.960
way too complicated
for ya.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.261
How come there
are two toilets?

02:10.263 --> 02:13.031
The other one's
for blood.

02:13.033 --> 02:16.101
(whimpering)

02:17.169 --> 02:20.171
Cleveland's old house.
Perfect!

02:20.173 --> 02:21.873
(whimpering)

02:21.875 --> 02:24.008
Damn, no toilet paper.

02:24.010 --> 02:24.576
(whimpers)

02:24.578 --> 02:26.444
Hey, Joe, can I borrow this?

02:26.446 --> 02:28.179
Sure.

02:34.053 --> 02:35.186
Peter, where
have you been?

02:35.188 --> 02:37.455
Oh, let's just say
I've been

02:37.457 --> 02:39.491
at Cleveland's empty house
taking a dump.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.425
Ugh! That's disgusting!

02:40.427 --> 02:43.928
I will be taking
all of my movements
there from now on.

02:43.930 --> 02:46.264
All of 'em!
Brrreeee-ha-ha!

Peter, your breakfast
is ready.

03:09.422 --> 03:11.022
Hang on.
I'll be right back, Lois.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.457
I'm just going
across the street.

03:12.459 --> 03:14.893
Peter, you can't keep
using Cleveland's bathroom.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.094
Oh, my God!
Yes, I can!

03:16.096 --> 03:18.263
Cleveland's bathroom
is the greatest discovery

03:18.265 --> 03:21.266
since fat women
discovered Diet Coke.

03:22.368 --> 03:24.903
Now I can eat anything!

03:28.440 --> 03:30.542
Hey, hey, hey, no, no, no!
What are you doing?!

03:30.544 --> 03:31.409
That's my bathroom!

03:31.411 --> 03:32.410
What are you
talking about?

03:32.412 --> 03:33.978
We just rented
this place.

03:33.980 --> 03:37.348
Holy crap! Dan Aykroyd
and Chevy Chase!

03:37.350 --> 03:39.184
What the hell are you guys
doing in Quahog?

03:39.186 --> 03:41.953
Oh, we're just doing
research for a movie.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.521
Oh, my God,
that's amazing!

03:43.523 --> 03:44.389
Listen, I gotta tell you guys,

03:44.391 --> 03:47.058
I've watched all your movies,
like, a thousand times.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.226
You saw <i>Cops</i>
<i>a</i> <i>nd Robbersons?</i>

03:48.228 --> 03:49.093
And <i>My Stepmother</i>
<i>I</i> <i>s An Alien?</i>

03:49.095 --> 03:52.964
Almost all of 'em.
Boy, I sure would love it
if you guys would come

03:52.966 --> 03:54.265
to our house
for dinner tonight.

03:54.267 --> 03:55.200
My wife's cooking sucks,

03:55.202 --> 03:56.634
but I just want
to look at ya.

03:56.636 --> 03:58.469
You like meat loaf?
Uh, yeah, sure.

03:58.471 --> 03:59.504
All right,
see you at 8:00.

03:59.506 --> 04:02.073
Oh, man I can't believe
I'm gonna have dinner

04:02.075 --> 04:03.474
with two
of the three amigos.

04:03.476 --> 04:04.576
This is gonna be way better

04:04.578 --> 04:08.146
than when we had that Victorian
girl ghost over for dinner.

04:08.148 --> 04:08.546
(sobs)

04:08.548 --> 04:11.149
My governess drowned me
in a well.

04:11.151 --> 04:14.919
You are a horrible
dinner guest.

04:19.258 --> 04:20.124
Can you believe it?

04:20.126 --> 04:22.493
We're eating with two
of the three ghostbusters.

04:22.495 --> 04:23.561
Actually,
I wasn't in that.

04:23.563 --> 04:26.364
Look at these guys,
they can't take
a compliment.

04:26.366 --> 04:27.765
You know, you guys are funny,

04:27.767 --> 04:30.101
but, uh, I got
a confession to make.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.537
I'm a pretty funny guy myself.

04:32.539 --> 04:35.106
Maybe I say a few things here,
maybe I get a few laughs.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.374
Maybe you guys put me
in one of your pictures.

04:36.376 --> 04:39.010
Uh, well, uh, yeah,
I suppose it's possible.

04:39.012 --> 04:41.145
Yeah, we got all kinds
of roles available.

04:41.147 --> 04:42.113
Speaking roles,
background roles.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.248
Background would be
good for you.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.049
Ooh, yeah.
Speaking role
or background role.

04:45.051 --> 04:45.750
Either one
would be good.

04:45.752 --> 04:47.652
You know, I'm really
good at sight gags.

04:47.654 --> 04:50.488
Oh, I didn't mean
to do that.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.590
Now it's everywhere!

04:52.592 --> 04:54.425
That's comedy.

04:54.427 --> 04:54.993
(laughs)

04:54.995 --> 04:57.328
Peter, what the hell
is wrong with you?
That's not funny.

04:57.330 --> 04:58.529
Oh, well, interesting
opinion, Lois.

04:58.531 --> 05:01.299
Gee, I wonder
if there's anyone
else at this table

05:01.301 --> 05:02.267
who's maybe
more qualified

05:02.269 --> 05:03.568
to say what's funny
than you are?

05:03.570 --> 05:06.004
Well, we'd need to see
a little bit more,

05:06.006 --> 05:07.639
but, uh... (chuckles)
Is that the time?

05:07.641 --> 05:09.841
I can't believe
that's the time.
It's late.

05:09.843 --> 05:12.310
I don't understand.
You're not wearing a watch.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.812
You see, that's sort
of a joke, Peter.

05:14.814 --> 05:17.215
Oh. Well, that's
not that funny.

05:17.217 --> 05:19.083
It's kind of funny,
you know.

05:19.085 --> 05:19.651
No, it's not funny.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.286
See, if you had said
something like,

05:21.288 --> 05:23.154
"Oh, it's half past
a freckle."

05:23.156 --> 05:23.554
(laughs)

05:23.556 --> 05:27.058
Oh, you know, I'm thinking
of the three of you.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.559
I'm-I'm thinking this guy...

05:28.561 --> 05:30.228
Let me show you
something that's funny.

05:30.230 --> 05:32.230
Okay, here's an impression
of John Wayne

05:32.232 --> 05:33.398
on the first Thanksgiving.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.666
(normal voice):
I'm John Wayne

05:34.668 --> 05:37.435
at the first
Thanksgiving, pilgrims.

05:37.437 --> 05:40.438
Happy Thanksgiving,
pilgrims.

05:40.440 --> 05:41.506
(laughs)

05:41.508 --> 05:42.540
Where's this guy been?

05:42.542 --> 05:44.342
Well, Mr. Griffin,
this has been a lot of fun.

05:44.344 --> 05:47.111
A lot of fun.
But we gotta get back
over to our place

05:47.113 --> 05:50.181
Mm-hmm.
and, uh, kinda do, uh...
what do we have to do?

05:50.183 --> 05:51.482
Roll some joints
and get high.

05:51.484 --> 05:53.318
Yeah, we gotta do
those things.

05:53.320 --> 05:53.885
That's not funny.

05:53.887 --> 05:56.521
Drugs aren't funny.
They ruin lives.

05:56.523 --> 05:57.155
Amen.

05:57.157 --> 05:58.756
No, Peter,
you're not funny.

05:58.758 --> 06:01.225
I'm afraid Dan's right.
You're not funny at all.

06:01.227 --> 06:02.327
I don't get it.

06:02.329 --> 06:04.329
You're painfully unfunny.

06:04.730 --> 06:07.432
Get the (bleep)
out of my house!

06:10.035 --> 06:12.170
Hey, Stewie, can I
talk to you for a sec?

06:12.172 --> 06:13.304
Look, Brian,
I've colored

06:13.306 --> 06:14.439
Sebastian the
crab blue.

06:14.441 --> 06:17.108
If that isn't a middle
finger to society,

06:17.110 --> 06:18.576
I don't know
what is.

06:18.578 --> 06:20.345
Ew, I don't
like it anymore.

06:20.347 --> 06:22.347
I wish I had
colored him red.

06:22.349 --> 06:23.381
Do you think
it's a little odd

06:23.383 --> 06:26.784
that Chevy Chase
and Dan Aykroyd have moved
into Quahog together?

06:26.786 --> 06:28.619
I mean...
why here, why now?

06:28.621 --> 06:29.354
I don't know.

06:29.356 --> 06:31.489
Maybe we go over
there and find out.

06:31.491 --> 06:32.590
Maybe we do.

06:32.592 --> 06:33.391
Hey. Hi, there.

06:33.393 --> 06:38.196
Uh, can you guys tell Meg
I'm seeing someone?

06:40.466 --> 06:41.366
BRIAN:
You see anything?

06:41.368 --> 06:43.334
Doesn't look like
anybody's home.

06:43.336 --> 06:44.802
(guns cock)

06:46.238 --> 06:49.640
Won't you gentleman
have a Pepsi?

06:58.117 --> 06:58.883
What do we do?

06:58.885 --> 07:03.488
"Won't you gentleman
have a Pepsi?"

07:07.526 --> 07:11.462
(both screaming)

07:11.464 --> 07:14.565
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

07:14.567 --> 07:17.201
Yell, yell, yell,
yell, yell, yell.

07:20.172 --> 07:22.040
(electronic trilling)

07:25.344 --> 07:26.344
What the...?

07:26.346 --> 07:28.079
What the hell
is this place?

07:28.081 --> 07:28.846
Welcome to D.U.M.P.--

07:28.848 --> 07:31.482
Deep Underground Military
Protection Facility.

07:31.484 --> 07:32.750
Wouldn't that
be D.U.M.P.F.?

07:32.752 --> 07:34.318
The "F" is silent,
like in "knife."

07:34.320 --> 07:37.221
We're actually working
for the federal government

07:37.223 --> 07:38.256
and we need your help.

07:38.258 --> 07:40.058
Do you want to be
spies like us?

07:40.060 --> 07:41.859
Can we be
spies like them?

07:41.861 --> 07:44.829
We've actually resolved
our differences.

07:50.402 --> 07:51.736
Wait a minute,
I don't understand.

07:51.738 --> 07:53.905
What do you mean you guys
work for the government?

07:53.907 --> 07:55.606
Well, Brian,
it turns out <i>Spies Like Us</i>

07:55.608 --> 07:57.608
was Ronald Reagan's
favorite movie.

07:57.610 --> 07:59.977
So he actually appointed us
honorary spies

07:59.979 --> 08:00.812
back in the '80s.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.713
That still doesn't explain
what you're doing here.

08:02.715 --> 08:04.248
You see, Brian,
during the Cold War

08:04.250 --> 08:07.185
the Soviet Union brainwashed
dozens of American civilians,

08:07.187 --> 08:08.586
effectively making them
sleeper agents

08:08.588 --> 08:10.521
who could be activated
at any time

08:10.523 --> 08:12.290
to do the work of the KGB.

08:12.292 --> 08:13.124
Activated how?

08:13.126 --> 08:14.459
The agents could be activated

08:14.461 --> 08:15.893
by uttering
a predetermined phrase.

08:15.895 --> 08:17.728
At which point,
they would snap into a trance

08:17.730 --> 08:20.665
and mindlessly carry out
whatever orders they were given

08:20.667 --> 08:21.766
by their KGB handlers.

08:21.768 --> 08:24.035
Well, I mean, what if
they encountered somebody

08:24.037 --> 08:25.603
who said the phrase
accidentally?

08:25.605 --> 08:26.237
Not possible.

08:26.239 --> 08:27.305
The activation phrase
was something

08:27.307 --> 08:29.474
that no one would
ever think to utter.
What is it?

08:29.476 --> 08:33.478
The phrase is, "Gosh, that
Italian family at the next table

08:33.480 --> 08:34.779
sure is quiet."

08:34.781 --> 08:35.746
You see,
the U.S. government

08:35.748 --> 08:37.615
believes that one of these
sleeper agents

08:37.617 --> 08:38.549
is right here in Quahog.

08:38.551 --> 08:41.252
Now you two...
individuals live here.

08:41.254 --> 08:42.420
Are there any local residents

08:42.422 --> 08:43.521
whom you've seen
acting strangely?

08:43.523 --> 08:44.856
Well, there's a pedophile
up the street

08:44.858 --> 08:46.724
that nobody seems to be
doing anything about,

08:46.726 --> 08:48.259
but it's mainly because
he's so funny.

08:48.261 --> 08:50.761
Well, look, we'd be happy
to help in any way we can.

08:50.763 --> 08:52.797
Hey, is Ron Howard's
weird-looking brother

08:52.799 --> 08:54.265
one of these lab
technicians?

08:54.267 --> 08:56.033
Of course he is.
It's an '80s movie.

08:56.035 --> 08:59.437
Hey, there's something
on the screen.

09:02.207 --> 09:03.808
And those two bums
turned to me

09:03.810 --> 09:05.343
and said, "You're
not funny, Peter."

09:05.345 --> 09:07.612
In my own house.
Well, what was the bit?

09:07.614 --> 09:08.212
Okay, ready?

09:08.214 --> 09:12.650
(John Wayne voice):
I'm John Wayne at the first
Thanksgiving, pilgrims.

09:12.652 --> 09:15.453
Happy Thanksgiving,
pilgrims.

09:15.455 --> 09:16.787
(both laughing)

09:16.789 --> 09:18.656
Oh, my.
Oh, my.

09:18.658 --> 09:19.790
Oh, my God,
Peter, I'll tell ya--

09:19.792 --> 09:22.560
and I'm your friend
and I'll be honest with you--

09:22.562 --> 09:23.594
that's funny;
that is funny.

09:23.596 --> 09:26.631
You know what I appreciate
about your joke, Peter?

09:26.633 --> 09:28.666
It's clean-- it's clean funny.

09:28.668 --> 09:29.834
I just wish there was some way

09:29.836 --> 09:31.002
I could show them
how wrong they are.

09:31.004 --> 09:33.538
Show 'em that we know comedy
better than they do.

09:33.540 --> 09:34.338
Hey, I got an idea.

09:34.340 --> 09:37.375
What's the most consistently
funny form of comedy

09:37.377 --> 09:39.443
in existence?

09:39.445 --> 09:40.912
Improv?
Improv!

09:40.914 --> 09:42.780
Improv.
Improv.

09:42.782 --> 09:43.681
Improv.

09:43.683 --> 09:44.582
Improv!

09:44.584 --> 09:46.617
We'll start our
own improv group

09:46.619 --> 09:49.253
and put on a show.
All right!

09:51.256 --> 09:54.358
Thank you for seeing us on
such short notice, Mayor West.

09:54.360 --> 09:55.793
No problem, gentlemen.

09:55.795 --> 09:57.828
May I call you gentlemen?
Yeah.

09:57.830 --> 10:01.499
Now you say this spy is
located somewhere in Quahog?

10:01.501 --> 10:03.935
That's right. We need you
to set up some roadblocks

10:03.937 --> 10:05.303
to help us contain him.

10:05.305 --> 10:06.337
Do you have any clues

10:06.339 --> 10:08.472
regarding the identity
of the spy?

10:08.474 --> 10:09.540
It's a little tricky, sir.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.375
See, the operative is
completely unaware

10:11.377 --> 10:12.510
that he's been programmed.

10:12.512 --> 10:13.678
And the only way
to activate him

10:13.680 --> 10:15.713
and discover his identity
is by saying the phrase,

10:15.715 --> 10:19.917
"Gosh, that Italian family at
the next table sure is quiet."

10:19.919 --> 10:22.286
(speaking Russian)

10:25.023 --> 10:26.357
It's him!

10:39.571 --> 10:41.505
(beeping)

10:44.343 --> 10:45.676
(groans)

10:45.678 --> 10:48.479
I haven't been this...
(moaning)

10:48.481 --> 10:50.715
since I... (moaning)

10:53.552 --> 10:54.151
I-I don't...

10:54.153 --> 10:57.588
I don't really know
what I'm supposed to be doing.

10:57.590 --> 10:59.090
Uh, but...

10:59.092 --> 11:01.492
Oh, there's track star
Wilma Rudolph.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.828
Obviously she had something
to do with the gag,

11:03.830 --> 11:06.097
but I didn't hear
the setup,

11:06.099 --> 11:08.633
so I don't really know
the context.

11:08.635 --> 11:11.469
Hey, I wonder what
Peter's up to?

11:13.438 --> 11:16.641
Okay, so we gotta come up with
a name for our improv group.

11:16.643 --> 11:17.675
Anybody got anything?

11:17.677 --> 11:18.576
Um...
Um...

11:18.578 --> 11:20.811
How about
"The Joke Ridge Boys"?

11:20.813 --> 11:21.646
Eh. Not bad.

11:21.648 --> 11:23.080
Wait, how about
"Funny Side Up"?

11:23.082 --> 11:25.449
No, no, no, guys, guys,
we've got the name.

11:25.451 --> 11:28.886
It's "Impravda:
The Truth is Ad-libbed."

11:28.888 --> 11:32.056
What about
"Deliveries in Rear"?

11:32.058 --> 11:32.857
Oh, yes!

11:32.859 --> 11:35.926
No, no, you can't just jam
jokes in for no reason.

11:35.928 --> 11:37.595
It has to be organic
to the situation.

11:37.597 --> 11:40.064
What the hell you being
so friggin' comedy Hitler about?

11:40.066 --> 11:42.466
I was in three improv groups
in college, Peter.

11:42.468 --> 11:45.236
I was in "Improvidence,"
I was in the "Wackadamia Nuts"

11:45.238 --> 11:47.004
and I know I'm dating
myself here,

11:47.006 --> 11:48.472
but "Three Smile Island."

11:48.474 --> 11:49.006
My point being

11:49.008 --> 11:51.175
that I am the only experienced
member of this group.

11:51.177 --> 11:54.812
I can already tell
this is not going to be fun.

12:05.824 --> 12:06.957
How do we know
where to start looking?

12:06.959 --> 12:09.327
The tracking beacon I shot
into Mayor West's ankle

12:09.329 --> 12:10.795
will allow us
to locate him.

12:10.797 --> 12:13.531
(rapid beeping)

12:15.367 --> 12:18.336
Wow, those are
the Russian people?

12:19.104 --> 12:21.739
I mean, granted, you do
think of bears on unicycles

12:21.741 --> 12:23.274
when you think of
the Russian people,

12:23.276 --> 12:25.676
but they're all bears
on unicycles?

12:25.678 --> 12:26.944
Bears on unicycles,
every one.

12:26.946 --> 12:27.745
So what do
we do now?

12:27.747 --> 12:30.014
We're undercover U.S. agents
in a hostile foreign territory.

12:30.016 --> 12:32.683
We've just gotta make sure
we don't do anything

12:32.685 --> 12:33.584
that makes us stick out.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.754
Hey! They're not
bears on unicycles!

12:36.756 --> 12:37.955
(guns cocking)

12:37.957 --> 12:39.557
You are under arrest.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.826
Oop.
Time to lose this costume.

12:42.761 --> 12:45.596
(high-pitched voice):
'Cause we're in Russia!

12:54.539 --> 12:58.976
Here are the American spies
we captured, Mr. Prime Minister.

13:01.780 --> 13:04.014
(all gasping)

13:04.016 --> 13:05.583
(all sighing)

13:06.618 --> 13:08.652
(all gasping)

13:10.088 --> 13:11.722
(all sighing)

13:13.058 --> 13:15.626
(all gasping)

13:15.628 --> 13:16.794
(all sighing)

13:16.796 --> 13:19.196
Well, he was "Putin"
us on, huh?

13:19.198 --> 13:20.231
Right?

13:20.233 --> 13:21.866
What do you think of that?

13:21.868 --> 13:22.700
Chevy, right?

13:22.702 --> 13:24.034
That would have
passed for funny

13:24.036 --> 13:25.770
in one of your
movies, right?

13:25.772 --> 13:26.737
Okay, movin' on.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.906
Gentlemen, let me put
your minds at ease.

13:28.908 --> 13:32.777
I know why you are here,
and I mean to help you.

13:32.779 --> 13:34.545
Oh... (laughing)

13:34.547 --> 13:35.212
Well, terrific.

13:35.214 --> 13:39.083
The truth is, the reactivation
of a Cold War sleeper spy

13:39.085 --> 13:41.685
would be an embarrassment
to my government.

13:41.687 --> 13:42.987
On the scale of our 1981

13:42.989 --> 13:45.289
failed Czechoslovakian
occupation outpost

13:45.291 --> 13:47.858
which was penetrated
by Bill Murray, Harold Ramis

13:47.860 --> 13:50.327
and their ragtag band
of misfit soldiers

13:50.329 --> 13:51.662
who didn't even graduate.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.364
They slept through
the graduation ceremony

13:53.366 --> 13:55.900
and somehow managed
to come out of the manhole

13:55.902 --> 13:57.902
wearing clean pressed
suit, as you say.

13:57.904 --> 13:59.837
So the long and
the veiny of it is

13:59.839 --> 14:01.038
you're gonna help
us out, right?

14:01.040 --> 14:03.274
I will provide you
with transportation,

14:03.276 --> 14:05.242
passports, food, supplies,

14:05.244 --> 14:07.244
everything from
A to backwards R.

14:07.246 --> 14:09.980
Wow, thank you so much
for your help, Mr. Putin.

14:09.982 --> 14:12.149
Would you like to see
Russian cutaway gag?

14:12.151 --> 14:15.085
Yeah, sure.
Here is Russian cutaway gag.

14:15.087 --> 14:17.621
(shouting in Russian)

14:24.596 --> 14:26.931
(laughing)

14:29.100 --> 14:30.034
Where the hell
is Quagmire?

14:30.036 --> 14:33.170
I don't know.
He said improv rehearsal
at 7:00, right?

14:33.172 --> 14:34.171
Yeah, where is Quagmire?

14:34.173 --> 14:35.005
I haven't
seen him all day.

14:35.007 --> 14:37.875
Oh, you know what?
I think he went
down to the bank.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.643
What was that?
What'd you hit me for?

14:39.645 --> 14:40.911
I'm passing
the story on to you.

14:40.913 --> 14:42.179
Keep it going,
keep the story going.

14:42.181 --> 14:43.747
Huh?
What's Quagmire
doing at the bank?

14:43.749 --> 14:44.849
It's improv, Peter.
You don't think,

14:44.851 --> 14:45.883
you don't think,
you don't think.

14:45.885 --> 14:46.951
You just keep talking.
You don't think.

14:46.953 --> 14:48.185
Don't think, don't think.
What comes to mind?

14:48.187 --> 14:49.987
Talk, talk, talk,
talk, talk!
Oh, I get it!

14:49.989 --> 14:51.288
Tap me, Quagmire,
tap me!

14:51.290 --> 14:53.691
Quagmire went to the
bank to donate sperm,

14:53.693 --> 14:54.992
because it's
a sperm bank.

14:54.994 --> 14:55.726
Yes! There you go.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.661
He's moving it forward,
he's moving it forward.

14:57.663 --> 14:59.296
See, Peter?
Now tap Peter.

14:59.298 --> 15:01.165
(John Wayne voice):
Hey, pilgrims.

15:01.167 --> 15:03.834
Happy Thanksgiving, pilgrims.

15:03.836 --> 15:05.035
It's me, John Wayne.

15:05.037 --> 15:06.570
Oh, no.
All right, you know what?

15:06.572 --> 15:07.404
You're not loosened up yet.

15:07.406 --> 15:09.306
All right, l-let's do
some warm-up exercises.

15:09.308 --> 15:12.009
Okay, this is one we call
"Going Bananas."

15:12.011 --> 15:12.576
Okay.

15:12.578 --> 15:15.346
♪ I'm a banana,
I'm a banana ♪

15:15.348 --> 15:18.382
♪ Peel the banana,
peel the banana ♪

15:18.384 --> 15:22.119
♪ Now go bananas,
go, go bananas ♪

15:22.121 --> 15:23.988
(yelling):
Gah...!

15:23.990 --> 15:26.290
Whoa! Come on, you guys,
do it with me!

15:26.292 --> 15:27.725
Go bananas! Yeah!

15:27.727 --> 15:30.160
(yelling):
Wah...!

15:30.162 --> 15:31.829
Whole body, Joe,
whole body!

15:31.831 --> 15:33.097
(Quagmire and Joe yelling)

15:33.099 --> 15:34.698
Come on, go bananas!

15:34.700 --> 15:36.433
Am I doing it?!
Am I doing it?!

15:36.435 --> 15:37.902
(bleep) the matter
with you guys?

15:37.904 --> 15:39.003
All right,
let's try something else.

15:39.005 --> 15:42.172
Okay, this is a warm-up exercise
called "One Word Story."

15:42.174 --> 15:44.141
Now, I start a story
with one word

15:44.143 --> 15:47.177
and then you each continue
with one word at a time.

15:47.179 --> 15:48.245
Okay, ready?
Yeah, yeah.

15:48.247 --> 15:50.247
I'm into this now.
Okay.

15:50.249 --> 15:51.215
The.

15:51.217 --> 15:52.249
Dog.

15:52.251 --> 15:53.217
And.

15:53.219 --> 15:54.218
My.

15:54.220 --> 15:55.252
Mom.

15:55.254 --> 15:56.220
And.

15:56.222 --> 15:57.121
This.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.255
Handkerchief.

15:58.257 --> 15:59.156
And.

15:59.158 --> 16:00.858
Twenty.
Birds.

16:00.860 --> 16:02.126
And.
Peter!

16:02.128 --> 16:03.127
Geez!
And.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.128
Peter, hang on a sec.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.362
You're not
contributing.

16:05.364 --> 16:06.030
I'm doing it.

16:06.032 --> 16:07.264
You're not
adding information.

16:07.266 --> 16:08.832
Well, one of you guys
says "Thanksgiving,"

16:08.834 --> 16:10.334
I got a good idea
where to go with it.

16:10.336 --> 16:13.037
Okay, Peter, let's try
something different.

16:13.039 --> 16:14.471
Okay, close your eyes.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.774
What's the first thing
you see?
Uh...

16:16.776 --> 16:19.243
Don't think, just say it.
First thing.
Pelican.

16:19.245 --> 16:20.311
Okay, what's he doing?

16:20.313 --> 16:21.879
He's complaining about

16:21.881 --> 16:22.980
some undercooked food.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.014
Who's he complaining to?

16:24.016 --> 16:25.549
A snooty French waiter.

16:25.551 --> 16:27.451
Who's really mean
to his customers.

16:27.453 --> 16:29.954
But then when he goes home,
his own life's sad,

16:29.956 --> 16:31.755
'cause his girlfriend's
mean to him

16:31.757 --> 16:33.490
and his apartment
isn't so very nice.

16:33.492 --> 16:36.160
And he's always
running out of paper towels.

16:36.162 --> 16:39.863
(panting)

16:39.865 --> 16:40.764
I saw it.

16:40.766 --> 16:41.799
I seen it, Quagmire.

16:41.801 --> 16:44.501
I was there, in the apartment.

16:44.503 --> 16:45.936
We're ready.

16:48.506 --> 16:49.707
If these signatures
are correct,

16:49.709 --> 16:52.843
Mayor West is located one-third
of a kilometer that way.

16:52.845 --> 16:53.911
Just over this rise.

16:53.913 --> 16:54.945
Yeah, that's what
you told us

16:54.947 --> 16:56.981
a third of a kilometer ago,
you douche.

16:56.983 --> 16:58.148
Perhaps you'd like
to do something

16:58.150 --> 17:00.884
besides criticizing me
and quoting my movies.

17:00.886 --> 17:04.221
You just
watch your mouth, mister.

17:05.256 --> 17:06.557
Look!

17:12.097 --> 17:13.430
(all gasp)

17:22.107 --> 17:23.874
Anyway,
I'd be happy to help you

17:23.876 --> 17:26.276
conduct a search
of Quahog and find--

17:26.278 --> 17:27.344
What the hell?

17:27.346 --> 17:27.878
Where am I?

17:27.880 --> 17:31.081
I didn't just bite into
a York Peppermint Patty, did I?

17:31.083 --> 17:32.316
Mayor West,
you're in Russia.

17:32.318 --> 17:34.184
You've just launched
a nuclear missile

17:34.186 --> 17:35.185
against the United States.

17:35.187 --> 17:37.388
Well, this day
has taken a bad turn.

17:37.390 --> 17:40.357
Like Mike Brady's
first marriage.

17:40.359 --> 17:42.126
Here's your
beer, honey.

17:43.161 --> 17:46.897
Huh. I don't remember
asking for a warm beer.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.866
Well, I didn't want
to quit working!

17:48.868 --> 17:49.299
You made me!

17:49.301 --> 17:52.369
You don't talk to me
that way!

17:54.439 --> 17:56.573
Alice, what did you see?

17:56.575 --> 17:58.108
Enough to know I'm
getting a raise.

17:58.110 --> 18:02.980
(upbeat musical stinger plays
over goofy recorded laughter)

18:08.553 --> 18:08.986
What the...?

18:08.988 --> 18:11.488
Oh, man, we're supposed
to do a show tonight.

18:11.490 --> 18:12.790
Where's the audience?

18:12.792 --> 18:13.991
I don't see them anywhere.

18:13.993 --> 18:15.459
If only they could
make some noise

18:15.461 --> 18:16.927
to let me know they're here.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.062
MAN:
We're here!

18:18.064 --> 18:19.096
Oh, there you are!

18:19.098 --> 18:19.997
(chuckles):
Oh, thank God.

18:19.999 --> 18:21.398
Well, we're
"Room For Improv-ment."

18:21.400 --> 18:24.001
So, without further ado,
I need a place.

18:24.003 --> 18:24.968
MAN:
Your ass!

18:24.970 --> 18:26.336
(chuckles):
Okay, come on now.

18:26.338 --> 18:27.271
Something serious.

18:27.273 --> 18:28.105
MAN:
Your mom's ass!

18:28.107 --> 18:30.274
Hey, let's get that guy
out of here, huh?

18:30.276 --> 18:31.008
Okay, a real place.

18:31.010 --> 18:33.477
MAN 2: Goldman's Pharmacy
on Third and Maple.

18:33.479 --> 18:34.778
WOMAN:
Give him the hours.

18:34.780 --> 18:35.579
MAN 2:
8:00 a.m. to...

18:35.581 --> 18:37.581
Okay, I heard "pharmacy."
Who's in the pharmacy?

18:37.583 --> 18:38.348
PETER:
John Wayne.

18:38.350 --> 18:41.051
What the-- Peter, you're not
supposed to be in the audience!

18:41.053 --> 18:44.188
Get the hell up on stage!

18:44.190 --> 18:44.722
All right.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.457
Hey, there, sir,
welcome to my pharmacy.

18:46.459 --> 18:46.957
Can I help you?

18:46.959 --> 18:49.126
Here's John Wayne at
the first Thanksgiving.

18:49.128 --> 18:52.362
(John Wayne voice):
Happy Thanksgiving, pilgrims.

18:52.364 --> 18:54.231
(laughter, applause)

18:54.233 --> 18:55.032
Ah, you like that?

18:55.034 --> 18:58.202
Okay, here's John Wayne Bobbitt
at the first Thanksgiving:

18:58.204 --> 19:01.338
Where's my penis,
pilgrims?

19:01.340 --> 19:02.406
(laughter)

19:02.408 --> 19:05.375
And here's John Wayne Gacy
at the first Thanksgiving.

19:05.377 --> 19:10.180
I want to dress up like a clown
and have sex with children

19:10.182 --> 19:11.982
and kill them, pilgrims.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.318
(laughter, applause)

19:14.320 --> 19:16.353
Guys, I got to split.

19:16.355 --> 19:19.022
I took a wet duke.

19:19.024 --> 19:19.323
And.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.892
Okay, this is not something that
should ever have been attempted.

19:21.894 --> 19:24.094
Thank you very much.
Good night, everybody.

19:24.096 --> 19:25.963
Improv!

19:39.477 --> 19:42.312
I wish there was some way
I could have prevented this.

19:42.314 --> 19:43.514
It wasn't your
fault, Mayor West.

19:43.516 --> 19:44.915
There's nothing
you could've done.

19:44.917 --> 19:47.351
To be honest,
I don't remember a thing.

19:47.353 --> 19:48.385
Except how much I love

19:48.387 --> 19:50.587
the Michael Jackson
"Thriller" video.

19:50.589 --> 19:53.190
Boy, could that guy dance!

19:53.192 --> 19:54.525
"Guy dance?"

19:54.527 --> 19:55.359
Guidance.

19:55.361 --> 19:56.593
Source programmable guidance.

19:56.595 --> 19:59.263
We can reprogram and disarm
the missile from here!

19:59.265 --> 20:00.230
From here?!
Well, our arms

20:00.232 --> 20:01.932
would have to be
40 feet long, Dan.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.167
No, yutz, not from
right here.

20:03.169 --> 20:04.501
We go over there
and do it.

20:04.503 --> 20:06.503
Oh, right.
Oh, come on, Chevy.

20:06.505 --> 20:09.206
You should've known
what he was talking about.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.541
All I have to do is bypass

20:10.543 --> 20:12.409
the primary navigational
guidance circuits,

20:12.411 --> 20:14.378
deprogram the hardwired
safety overrides

20:14.380 --> 20:16.513
and reconfigure the motherboard
so that the missile's

20:16.515 --> 20:19.049
primary central processing unit
tells itself

20:19.051 --> 20:21.084
to eject its own warhead
while still

20:21.086 --> 20:23.020
safely above
the Earth's atmosphere.

20:23.022 --> 20:24.321
Hey, Dan,
when this is all over,

20:24.323 --> 20:27.558
you may get a call asking you
to evaluate my performance.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.194
Can I count on you
to give me a ten?

20:30.196 --> 20:32.262
And that should do it.

20:44.342 --> 20:45.342
You did it, Dan!

20:45.344 --> 20:46.543
My God, you did it!

20:46.545 --> 20:49.046
(cheering, laughter)

20:50.381 --> 20:51.381
Mission accomplished,
gentlemen.

20:51.383 --> 20:54.251
Warhead has been destroyed,
we've saved millions of lives.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.186
Let's just hope the
fuselage doesn't fall

20:56.188 --> 20:58.455
where it can cause
too much damage.

21:02.961 --> 21:06.330
No, no, no, no, no, no!

21:08.366 --> 21:10.801
I-I don't get it.

21:16.574 --> 21:18.041
So what's the
deal with Chris?

21:18.043 --> 21:20.410
Is he actually, like,
still in Africa?

21:20.412 --> 21:21.111
No, no, he's not.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.980
So that was all,
that was just a bit.

21:22.982 --> 21:24.314
Yeah, he'll be back
next week.
Great.

21:24.316 --> 21:27.284
Boy, who would've thought all
this trouble could be caused

21:27.286 --> 21:28.218
by simply uttering
the phrase:

21:28.220 --> 21:32.556
"Gosh, that Italian family at
the next table sure is quiet."

21:38.429 --> 21:40.931
(speaking Russian)

21:44.769 --> 21:48.038
MAN (Russian accent):
Shut up, 2476.
