00:25.275 --> 00:27.735
In the darkest depth
of cyberspace,

00:27.736 --> 00:29.321
there is another world.

00:30.822 --> 00:35.451
A lost dimension,
home to wonders unseen,

00:35.452 --> 00:37.329
terrors unspeakable.

00:39.248 --> 00:43.710
Stories unlike any

01:17.411 --> 01:19.745
Life is a lot like Frogger.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.038
Chaos surrounds us

01:21.039 --> 01:23.207
and death is
everywhere you look.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.626
To survive in
Frogger and in life,

01:25.627 --> 01:28.629
you have to obey
two simple rules.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.132
Keep thy.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.383
Hey, what are you
doing in there?

01:32.384 --> 01:34.385
Nothing?

01:34.386 --> 01:35.428
Well, shake a leg.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.222
You're gonna be late for church.

01:43.645 --> 01:44.937
To survive in Frogger,

01:44.938 --> 01:46.063
and in life,

01:46.064 --> 01:48.232
you have to obey
two simple rules:

01:48.233 --> 01:49.817
Keep thy head down.

01:49.818 --> 01:51.028
Run like hell.

01:53.071 --> 01:54.613
On the highway of life,

01:54.614 --> 01:57.033
every second can be your last.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.659
If you wanna make it
across the road,

01:58.660 --> 01:59.827
you have to see trouble coming

01:59.828 --> 02:01.538
and avoid it at all costs.

02:03.749 --> 02:05.916
Hesitate and you're dead.

02:05.917 --> 02:08.252
Stop and smell the rosesbam.

02:08.252 --> 02:10.130
You're pushing daisies, pal.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.049
Don't be a hero, don't show off,

02:13.050 --> 02:14.718
just follow the
arcade commandments.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.724
And above all else,

02:21.725 --> 02:23.935
try not to get eaten.

02:44.456 --> 02:46.248
You're really good.

02:46.249 --> 02:49.627
Yep.

02:49.628 --> 02:51.253
Think you'll get a high score?

02:51.254 --> 02:53.298
I'm actually trying
for a kill screen.

03:05.102 --> 03:06.477
What's a kill screen?

03:06.478 --> 03:07.687
It's when you get
a score so high,

03:07.688 --> 03:08.729
it crashes the game.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.440
I'm really close
to getting one, so...

03:11.441 --> 03:13.484
Wilma, I think
this game's busted.

03:13.485 --> 03:14.819
It ate my quarter.

03:14.820 --> 03:16.987
No quartershit the bricks!

03:16.988 --> 03:19.490
Man, this place sucks.

03:19.491 --> 03:21.242
Hey, you go to Jefferson.

03:21.243 --> 03:22.660
I've seen you at the bike racks.

03:22.661 --> 03:23.453
I just moved here.

03:23.454 --> 03:24.620
Do you wanna be friends?

03:24.621 --> 03:26.247
Mom says I have to try to
make friends this time.

03:26.248 --> 03:28.165
I'm Amy. Amy, I really need

03:28.166 --> 03:30.084
to focus here.

03:30.085 --> 03:34.548
Hey, Wilma, I am so
sorry that I'm late.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.641
Wow, that guy is hot.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.853
 Did you get it?

03:48.854 --> 03:50.354
Did you kill the screen?

03:50.355 --> 03:51.814
He wishes.

03:51.815 --> 03:53.691
Can smell that pizza now, Myers.

03:53.692 --> 03:56.610
Is that, pepperoni
or fine Italian sausage?

03:56.611 --> 03:58.154
In your dreams.

03:58.155 --> 03:59.321
Free pizza?

03:59.322 --> 04:01.615
Only if he gets the kill
screen before I do.

04:01.616 --> 04:04.034
Well, now you're
both in trouble.

04:04.035 --> 04:06.829
Hey, you're welcome for
your mail, by the way.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.747
Mail? You get your mail
delivered to the arcade?

04:08.748 --> 04:11.459
You do when your parents think
that video games are the devil.

04:11.460 --> 04:15.172
If anybody asks, he's at
Bible study right now.

04:19.009 --> 04:20.384
My God.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.344
What, is that it?

04:21.345 --> 04:22.511
Bits 'N Blips.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.389
Well, go on, man, open it!

04:28.852 --> 04:30.561
"Dear Andrew."

04:30.562 --> 04:31.896
Thank you for your
recent submission,

04:31.897 --> 04:33.731
"'Conquering Centipede
in 100 Simple Steps.'"

04:33.732 --> 04:35.524
"We found your writing
to be both informative

04:35.525 --> 04:36.734
"and enjoyable," see, dude?

04:36.735 --> 04:38.569
I told you they'd like it.

04:38.570 --> 04:41.071
"Unfortunately, as
Centipede is an older title,"

04:41.072 --> 04:42.907
blah, blah, blah,
"write about a newer game

04:42.908 --> 04:44.909
if you ever want
to get published."

04:44.910 --> 04:46.535
You shoulda wrote
about Millipede.

04:46.536 --> 04:47.620
That game rocks.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.580
I'm... sorry, who are you?

04:49.581 --> 04:50.748
I'm Amy.

04:50.749 --> 04:51.916
Well, bad news, Amy.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.083
This is the only arcade in town,

04:53.084 --> 04:54.418
and this place is in
the middle of nowhere.

04:54.419 --> 04:55.711
We never get any new games.

04:55.712 --> 04:58.047
Come on, buddy,
it's not that bad.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.381
I'm sure you'll find
a way out someday.

04:59.382 --> 05:00.591
It's official.

05:00.592 --> 05:02.802
I'm going to die in Beaverton.
Okay, that is not true.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.094
One day, I'm going
to be able to tell

05:04.095 --> 05:05.304
every single kid
that comes in here

05:05.305 --> 05:06.264
that I was once best buds with

05:06.265 --> 05:10.100
the great video game
journalist Andrew Myers.

05:10.101 --> 05:12.103
Thanks.

05:13.605 --> 05:16.982
Hey, what are you.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.275
For my scrapbook.

05:18.276 --> 05:20.194
You guys wanna
play another round?

05:20.195 --> 05:21.487
I should probably go.

05:21.488 --> 05:22.780
I'm out of quarters anyway.

05:22.781 --> 05:26.075
You're out of quarters, then
I know, the bricks.

05:26.076 --> 05:28.202
I'll catch you guys later...

05:28.203 --> 05:30.789
if I live that long.

05:43.426 --> 05:44.803
What's this?

05:46.596 --> 05:49.849
Polybeeus.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.810
Polybuyus?

05:52.811 --> 05:53.811
Weird.

05:53.812 --> 05:54.979
Hey, Wilma.

05:54.980 --> 05:57.982
How long have we had this?
Get back to work.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.316
I mean, if it were new,

05:59.317 --> 06:01.068
we would have heard about a
release or something, right?

06:01.069 --> 06:03.487
There's always ads,
previews, and junk.

06:03.488 --> 06:04.697
I bet it's a beta.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.073
A what now?

06:06.074 --> 06:07.241
When they make a new game,

06:07.242 --> 06:08.742
sometimes they place
a prototype into the wild,

06:08.743 --> 06:10.953
you know, see
what the kids think.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.454
They call it a beta.
A game so new

06:12.455 --> 06:14.373
it's not even out yet.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.209
Bits 'N Blips'll flip!

06:22.007 --> 06:24.884
I'd watch out for that thing.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.094
Why is that?

06:27.095 --> 06:28.512
It ate my quarter.

06:28.513 --> 06:32.309
If you aren't careful,
it'll eat yours too.

06:33.852 --> 06:35.352
Scram, kid.

06:35.353 --> 06:36.812
You'll be sorry! Jess!

06:36.813 --> 06:40.232
well, I gotta get back
to fixing the Robotron machine,

06:40.233 --> 06:42.819
but I'll catch you
guys later, okay?

06:44.863 --> 06:49.033
Welcome to 198404.

06:49.034 --> 06:51.410
If you're jonesing
for a rosecolored ride

06:51.411 --> 06:56.582
down memory lane,
you're in the wrong dimension.

06:56.583 --> 06:59.960
Because tonight, the nerd
doesn't get the girl.

06:59.961 --> 07:02.880
The bully doesn't get
what's coming to him.

07:02.881 --> 07:05.674
Tonight, a kid living
life on hard mode

07:05.675 --> 07:09.887
tries to survive it
one quarter at a time

07:09.888 --> 07:12.389
and discovers the things in life

07:12.390 --> 07:13.390
no man can escape.

07:13.391 --> 07:14.850
Heads up, freshman.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.769
What his heart wants,

07:16.770 --> 07:18.520
what his mind fears,

07:18.521 --> 07:22.441
and whatever the hell
is in Polybius.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.194
Hey, swimming laps
today, ladies.

07:25.195 --> 07:26.945
And no one dips a toe in my pool

07:26.946 --> 07:29.073
without showerin' off first.

07:29.074 --> 07:31.033
So get stripped
and start scrubbin'.

07:31.034 --> 07:32.743
Whoo! Hey!

07:32.744 --> 07:35.413
No, none of that homo stuff.

07:38.041 --> 07:42.087
Man, why is it these jerks are
at the top of the food chain?

07:47.425 --> 07:48.759
Keep your head down
and keep moving.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.219
We'll make it out
the other side.

07:50.220 --> 07:52.388
Screw that, man,
I'm takin' a shower.

07:52.389 --> 07:53.555
Dude, are you crazy?

07:53.556 --> 07:55.599
They can't kick all our asses.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.103
Freshmen...

08:00.271 --> 08:02.981
What do we have here?

08:02.982 --> 08:04.901
You wanna shower with
the big boys, Dennis?

08:06.277 --> 08:07.611
You know what, faggot?

08:07.612 --> 08:11.866
You just won yourself a visit
from the magic finger.

08:15.161 --> 08:17.538
No, you're just
messin', right, man?

08:17.539 --> 08:18.622
Here's the deal.

08:18.623 --> 08:21.917
You can beat me up, but
don't give me the finger.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.127
What's the matter?

08:23.128 --> 08:25.797
You afraid you're gonna like it?

08:27.090 --> 08:29.092
You can stay and play too, nerd.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.471
... Please, don't leave.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.140
I'm sorry, man.

08:39.477 --> 08:42.981
Now, can I get a
drum roll, please?

09:03.585 --> 09:05.335
'Kay, me first! Nope, sorry.

09:05.336 --> 09:07.172
Quarter.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.598
All right, Bits 'N Blips.

09:17.599 --> 09:20.517
Here I come.

09:20.518 --> 09:22.312
Nono, come on.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.567
Okay. There it goes.

09:32.781 --> 09:34.698
A maze game.

09:34.699 --> 09:35.825
Okay.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.703
Is that all you do
is wander around?

09:39.704 --> 09:40.704
Real scary.

09:45.960 --> 09:49.046
Your souls are mine.

09:49.047 --> 09:51.131
What is that?

09:51.132 --> 09:52.382
He's getting faster.

09:52.383 --> 09:54.510
He's gaining. There's no exit.

09:54.511 --> 09:55.761
This is weird.

09:55.762 --> 09:58.222
You just rack up
points until you die.

09:58.223 --> 09:59.765
Let me try again.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.058
You're just
wasting your quarters.

10:01.059 --> 10:02.684
Hold on, I got this.

10:02.685 --> 10:03.685
Come on.

10:07.065 --> 10:08.608
Run!

10:14.737 --> 10:18.802
Kill screen? Kill screen...

10:42.892 --> 10:47.105
Your souls are mine.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.467
Hey Myers.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.553
Hey Dennis!

11:19.554 --> 11:20.513
Are you okay?

11:20.514 --> 11:21.972
Take a wild guess.

11:21.973 --> 11:23.892
What was I supposed to do?

11:25.055 --> 11:28.104
Are you okay?
What is your problem?

11:31.274 --> 11:33.610
You should have run.

11:35.111 --> 11:36.528
Running would have been a picnic

11:36.529 --> 11:39.281
compared to what
I'm gonna do to you.

11:39.282 --> 11:40.782
Hey.

11:40.783 --> 11:44.286
You get out now.

11:44.287 --> 11:46.164
Okay.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.959
I'll see you in
gym class, dweeb.

11:53.755 --> 11:54.963
Hey.

11:54.964 --> 11:57.132
You okay, man?

11:57.133 --> 11:58.635
You okay?

12:07.936 --> 12:10.812
I'm fine.

12:10.813 --> 12:12.606
I gotta go.

12:12.607 --> 12:14.733
Andrew, wait!

12:14.734 --> 12:15.734
Andrew.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.002
The parents of a high
school boy were shocked

12:34.003 --> 12:36.630
by the mysterious death
of their 14yearold son,

12:36.631 --> 12:39.049
found deceased
early this morning.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.842
Melvin Raimi of Jefferson High

12:40.843 --> 12:41.927
was discovered in the basement

12:41.928 --> 12:43.887
of his parents'
Beaverton Court home.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.223
No details as to
the cause of death

12:46.224 --> 12:47.683
have been released at this time.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.184
A source close to the family

12:49.185 --> 12:51.603
detailed the scene
as "beyond description."

12:51.604 --> 12:53.856
More on this tragic
incident, soon.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.029
Ew! I have a surprise

13:01.030 --> 13:02.698
for that barf bag
where's his locker?

13:02.699 --> 13:06.034
No, Amy, please just
leave it alone, okay?

13:06.035 --> 13:07.953
No way, after what he did?

13:07.954 --> 13:09.413
You don't know the whole story.

13:09.414 --> 13:11.373
Andrew, he called you...

13:11.374 --> 13:12.916
an FAG.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.418
You don't call people
that, it's mean.

13:14.419 --> 13:17.921
Especially if they're
Especially if they're what?

13:17.922 --> 13:20.507
If they're...

13:20.508 --> 13:22.718
different.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.386
Listen.

13:24.387 --> 13:26.305
Where are you from, again?

13:26.306 --> 13:27.931
San Diego.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.850
Well, originally Boston
by way of Chattanooga.

13:29.851 --> 13:31.601
Okay, well, you're
in Beaverton now,

13:31.602 --> 13:35.105
right, and being different
in Beaverton gets you killed.

13:35.106 --> 13:36.606
Believe it or not, Kill Screen,

13:36.607 --> 13:40.944
I kinda know a lot
about being different.

13:40.945 --> 13:43.030
I'm just saying
we're friends now,

13:43.031 --> 13:45.282
you can talk to me,
even share secrets.

13:45.283 --> 13:47.200
Look, you don't
even know me, okay?

13:47.201 --> 13:49.036
You don't know the
first thing about me.

13:49.037 --> 13:51.121
But I'm not different.

13:51.122 --> 13:52.247
You're not my friend.

13:52.248 --> 13:53.749
Keep your head down,
keep to yourself,

13:53.750 --> 13:55.333
and if someone
calls me an FAG,

13:55.334 --> 13:58.504
do us both a favor and
leave me the hell alone.

14:21.235 --> 14:23.320
What's going on in there?

14:23.321 --> 14:24.821
Just saying my prayers.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.490
Well, it's bedtime,
get to sleep.

14:26.491 --> 14:28.493
Yes sir, goodnight.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.473
Dad?

14:56.854 --> 14:58.439
Hello?

15:52.410 --> 15:54.703
Hey, Myers.

15:54.704 --> 15:57.248
See you in gym class, dweeb.

16:14.265 --> 16:16.725
All right, everyone,
quit your dillydallying.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.936
Get in the showers.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.620
Um...

16:36.621 --> 16:39.581
I... just,

16:39.582 --> 16:42.542
freshening up, um, I...

16:42.543 --> 16:44.044
Shower.

16:44.045 --> 16:45.921
Yeah.

16:45.922 --> 16:48.007
Shower Yeah.

16:58.809 --> 17:00.477
Hop in, frosh.

17:00.478 --> 17:02.063
Water's fine.

17:25.711 --> 17:28.172
Myers, don't leave me, Myers.

17:44.355 --> 17:45.981
Excuse me, Detective?

17:45.982 --> 17:48.024
I think I might know
something about what's happened.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.568
Tell us what you know, son.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.194
This is gonna sound weird,

17:51.195 --> 17:53.780
but there's a strange
video game at Wilma's Arcade.

17:53.781 --> 17:56.283
It's called Polybius,
it might be a beta,

17:56.284 --> 17:58.785
that's besides the point, um...

17:58.786 --> 18:00.745
Look, there's this
weird symbol, right?

18:00.746 --> 18:04.541
And... the nightmares...

18:04.542 --> 18:06.209
Okay, just lemme back up.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.044
There's this monster, see.

18:08.045 --> 18:09.045
Slow down.

18:09.046 --> 18:09.964
What's your name?

18:09.965 --> 18:11.506
Um, Andrew Myers.

18:11.507 --> 18:12.882
Well, Andrew Myers,

18:12.883 --> 18:16.136
I'm gonna make you my
junior detective, okay?

18:16.137 --> 18:17.262
Take this notebook,

18:17.263 --> 18:20.724
write down all your scary
video game nightmares

18:20.725 --> 18:21.725
into that book,

18:21.726 --> 18:23.602
then you hand it to
MeeMaw and PawPaw

18:23.603 --> 18:26.229
and you let them handle it.
I'm not making any of this up.

18:26.230 --> 18:29.316
Myers, come on, let's go.
lt's a crime scene, okay?

18:29.317 --> 18:30.859
Go on, buddy. God.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.236
Run on home now.

18:34.739 --> 18:37.282
Excuse me.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.909
Did I hear that right?

18:39.910 --> 18:42.788
Did you play a game
called Polybius?

18:44.498 --> 18:46.833
You gonna make fun of me too?

18:46.834 --> 18:48.418
Who else have you told?

18:48.419 --> 18:52.047
Just him, and now you, I guess.

18:52.048 --> 18:55.258
Do you know anyone else
that's played the game?

18:55.259 --> 18:56.885
What's going on?

18:56.886 --> 18:59.095
Why don't you come
with me, Andrew,

18:59.096 --> 19:02.432
and we'll talk about Polybius.

19:02.433 --> 19:03.768
Who are you?

19:05.311 --> 19:09.689
You... obviously like
video games, right?

19:09.690 --> 19:11.316
Well, we've got
all the best ones.

19:11.317 --> 19:16.613
PacMan, Missile
Attack, Mr. Frog.

19:16.614 --> 19:20.784
Maybe even a few
you've never heard of.

19:20.785 --> 19:21.869
Come with me.

19:23.454 --> 19:26.707
I've got a whole roll
of quarters in the car.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.796
 Bedtime, buddy.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.172
Say your prayers
and hit the hay.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.508
Okay.

20:18.509 --> 20:20.344
I don't hear you praying.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.182
Now I lay me down to sleep,

20:26.183 --> 20:27.892
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.269
If I die before I wake,

20:29.270 --> 20:30.855
I pray the Lord...

20:33.941 --> 20:36.026
my soul to take.

20:44.201 --> 20:46.536
It appears the case
is an isolated incident

20:46.537 --> 20:49.622
and has no connection with
the discovery of Melvin Raimi,

20:49.623 --> 20:51.875
found deceased
earlier this morning.

20:51.876 --> 20:53.710
Authorities are urging witnesses

20:53.711 --> 20:55.754
or anyone with
knowledge of the crime

20:55.755 --> 20:59.382
to come forth and contact the
county sheriff's department.

20:59.383 --> 21:02.177
Now, on to Sports.
Quittin' time, Amy.

21:02.178 --> 21:05.556
Come on, just one more!

21:11.061 --> 21:12.562
All righty, Amy, come on.

21:12.563 --> 21:15.858
Okay, okaywait a second.
Come on, it's time to go.

21:18.903 --> 21:19.944
Hey.

21:19.945 --> 21:21.404
Um, sir?

21:21.405 --> 21:24.324
I'm sorry, but we're closed.

21:24.325 --> 21:26.035
Andrew?

21:28.162 --> 21:30.539
It's not just a game.

21:34.043 --> 21:36.169
Andrew, that's just...

21:36.170 --> 21:38.172
it's just crazy, man.

21:40.090 --> 21:41.425
Is it?

21:44.512 --> 21:46.095
Jesus, you too?

21:46.096 --> 21:48.932
I was trying to knock FAG
off the highscore board.

21:48.933 --> 21:51.309
I played last night till
I ran out of quarters,

21:51.310 --> 21:53.061
had a bad dream, and I woke up,

21:53.062 --> 21:55.522
and this was on my tummy, I

21:55.523 --> 21:58.608
I thought it was a rash.

21:58.609 --> 21:59.901
I get those.

21:59.902 --> 22:01.736
In the shape of the
symbol from the game?

22:01.737 --> 22:03.780
Come on. No, it's gotta be

22:03.781 --> 22:05.031
just a coincidence, man.

22:05.032 --> 22:07.784
What about the guy in the suit?

22:07.785 --> 22:09.702
Probably a child molester.

22:09.703 --> 22:10.954
That's a relief.

22:10.955 --> 22:12.580
What are you trying
to say, man, that

22:12.581 --> 22:15.166
that these guys are going
after and killing everyone

22:15.167 --> 22:16.752
that's played the game?

22:19.463 --> 22:20.713
What I'm trying to say is,

22:20.714 --> 22:23.550
I think it is the game.

22:23.551 --> 22:25.218
In the Revelations of Ezekiel,

22:25.219 --> 22:26.636
one of the lost
books of the Bible,

22:26.637 --> 22:29.347
there's a story about
an angel named Polybius.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.182
He was like a heavenly muse.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.976
He inspired artists to
create works of beauty

22:32.977 --> 22:34.477
in the Lord's name.

22:34.478 --> 22:37.689
Songs, paintings,
stuff like that.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.732
But God got all the
credit for the work.

22:39.733 --> 22:41.192
So one day, a jealous Polybius

22:41.193 --> 22:43.820
inspired someone to do
a painting on him instead.

22:43.821 --> 22:44.863
When God found out,

22:44.864 --> 22:46.239
He branded him with
the mark of death

22:46.240 --> 22:47.490
and cast him out.

22:47.491 --> 22:48.992
That's just crazy, man.

22:48.993 --> 22:51.035
According to lore,
he's still out there,

22:51.036 --> 22:53.997
wandering the fiery maze
of hell for all of eternity.

22:53.998 --> 22:57.584
His only remaining power is to
possess the artists of Earth.

22:57.585 --> 22:59.044
Here, listen.

23:02.256 --> 23:04.132
"And woe be to all who listen."

23:04.133 --> 23:05.508
The foul works made in his name,

23:05.509 --> 23:08.052
for by night, Polybius
shall brand their flesh

23:08.053 --> 23:11.598
"and cast their souls into hell."

23:11.599 --> 23:13.308
Polybius is real.

23:13.309 --> 23:14.642
Okay, somehow, that
thing got into the game,

23:14.643 --> 23:16.853
and we played it, right?

23:16.854 --> 23:18.229
So we're marked.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.273
We've been cursed.

23:20.274 --> 23:22.942
Tonight, he'll come for us
and try to claim our souls.

23:22.943 --> 23:25.361
I mean, that's just stupid.

23:25.362 --> 23:28.197
The marks, the monster,
"your souls are mine"?

23:28.198 --> 23:31.367
Hell, even that guy,
the... child molester!

23:31.368 --> 23:33.161
He kept talking
about video games

23:33.162 --> 23:34.370
like he knows something.

23:34.371 --> 23:35.538
It's stupid, it's clearly

23:35.539 --> 23:36.457
a government experiment.

23:36.458 --> 23:37.790
And that's impossible.

23:37.791 --> 23:40.919
Makes more sense than demons.
Guys?

23:40.920 --> 23:42.378
lt's just, it's lt's.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.173
It's alive.

23:50.971 --> 23:52.473
My God.

23:54.141 --> 23:56.267
Look, there's obviously
something strange

23:56.268 --> 23:57.560
going on in Beaverton.

23:57.561 --> 23:59.479
I think the bodies of
Dennis and Headgear Kid

23:59.480 --> 24:00.730
prove that much.

24:00.731 --> 24:03.191
If I'm right
and it is this game,

24:03.192 --> 24:04.484
we need to figure out
where it came from

24:04.485 --> 24:05.902
and get some answers.

24:05.903 --> 24:07.779
And what if we can't?

24:07.780 --> 24:10.031
Then we might not make it
through the night.

24:10.032 --> 24:12.450
But if that's the case,

24:12.451 --> 24:14.203
we do what I always do.

24:18.082 --> 24:19.833
We run like hell.

24:23.963 --> 24:27.633
Your souls are mine!

24:34.848 --> 24:36.933
All right, I'm gonna go
check Wilma's back office,

24:36.934 --> 24:39.936
see if I can dig
anything up on this thing.

24:39.937 --> 24:41.187
I'll start with Bits 'N Blips.

24:41.188 --> 24:44.066
Just see if you can find
any mention of Polybius.

24:48.779 --> 24:50.446
So.

24:50.447 --> 24:51.949
Crazy day?

24:53.617 --> 24:55.035
Yeah.

24:57.621 --> 24:59.455
Hey, and about this morning,

24:59.456 --> 25:02.209
I'm sorry, I was
being a huge jerk.

25:03.627 --> 25:06.337
I was being nosy.

25:06.338 --> 25:09.007
I kind of have
a problem with that, so.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.759
I'm sorry I lashed out.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.136
Cool beans?

25:13.137 --> 25:14.137
Cool beans.

25:14.930 --> 25:16.140
Hand hug!

25:22.396 --> 25:25.064
For what it's worth, though...

25:25.065 --> 25:28.401
I think you guys would
make a really cute couple.

25:28.402 --> 25:32.363
I don'tI don't know
what you're talking about.

25:32.364 --> 25:33.657
Okay then.

25:37.703 --> 25:40.621
You think that he might be
Have you asked him?

25:40.622 --> 25:42.040
Of course not!

25:42.041 --> 25:43.042
I don't...

25:44.001 --> 25:47.171
He sorts your mail, Andrew.

25:50.340 --> 25:54.677
Maybe you should go
see if he needs some...

25:54.678 --> 25:55.971
help?

26:00.851 --> 26:04.687
Yeah, go see if he needs some...

26:04.688 --> 26:05.606
all right.

26:05.607 --> 26:06.690
Yeah.

26:10.319 --> 26:11.862
Scream if you need me.

26:13.113 --> 26:14.698
Hey, Jess!

26:16.992 --> 26:18.410
Jess?

26:23.665 --> 26:24.958
Jess?

26:31.715 --> 26:33.049
Jess!

26:33.050 --> 26:34.551
Jess, is that you?

26:44.728 --> 26:45.728
Wilma!

26:45.729 --> 26:47.605
Hey.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.648
She's sleeping.

26:48.649 --> 26:50.691
Whatwhat are you doing?

26:50.692 --> 26:52.110
Wilma keeps everything in here.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.820
So if we can trace
the cabinet back

26:53.821 --> 26:55.238
to a name or an address, then

26:55.239 --> 26:57.740
Why don't we just ask her?
No, no, no!

26:57.741 --> 26:58.866
Trust me.

26:58.867 --> 27:00.994
You do not want to
wake that woman up.

27:03.914 --> 27:05.791
Come on, help me look.

27:12.798 --> 27:15.883
Did you know Wilma ran
a laundrymat in Austin?

27:15.884 --> 27:19.387
Portland, Albuquerque,
Detroit... man.

27:19.388 --> 27:20.888
She's been everywhere.

27:20.889 --> 27:24.767
Makes you wonder how she
ended up in a dump like this.

27:24.768 --> 27:26.185
If I actually
die in Beaverton...

27:26.186 --> 27:28.396
Okay, dude; We get it.

27:28.397 --> 27:30.273
Beaverton blows.

27:30.274 --> 27:32.149
Listen, I'm not trying
to say that I like this town

27:32.150 --> 27:33.818
any more than you, but...

27:33.819 --> 27:36.195
instead of wanting to be
somewhere else all the time,

27:36.196 --> 27:39.615
why don't you just
try being here?

27:39.616 --> 27:41.158
What's so great
about being here?

27:41.159 --> 27:43.786
I don't know, your friends?

27:43.787 --> 27:45.538
Amy?

27:45.539 --> 27:47.249
Me?

27:50.961 --> 27:52.086
Look.

27:52.087 --> 27:54.505
I'm not bound for
greatness, like you.

27:54.506 --> 27:58.426
'Kay, I'm a Dstudent
on a good day at best.

27:58.427 --> 28:02.013
Jess But the point is,

28:02.014 --> 28:03.890
I don't let it anchor me down.

28:03.891 --> 28:06.267
I live life in the
moment, you know?

28:06.268 --> 28:08.978
That's very Yoda of you.

28:08.979 --> 28:11.565
Try it sometime, you should!

28:18.488 --> 28:19.656
Whoa!

28:21.700 --> 28:22.700
What are you doing?

28:22.701 --> 28:24.201
I...

28:24.202 --> 28:25.746
living in the moment?

28:41.553 --> 28:43.930
Look, I'm sorry, dude,
I just thought that.

28:43.931 --> 28:46.515
Youyou thought what?

28:46.516 --> 28:48.351
Psst!

28:48.352 --> 28:49.853
You guys!

28:55.525 --> 28:57.110
Damn!

29:06.036 --> 29:07.119
That's the guy!

29:07.120 --> 29:09.872
He must have followed
me from school.

29:09.873 --> 29:11.791
We should bail.

29:11.792 --> 29:13.417
And go where?

29:13.418 --> 29:16.379
It's not like we actually
still know what's goin' on.

29:16.380 --> 29:17.880
That guy knows something.

29:17.881 --> 29:20.049
I bet my allowance on it.

29:20.050 --> 29:22.427
Why don't you walk up and ask?

29:53.917 --> 29:56.336
Can I ask you a few questions?

29:57.421 --> 29:59.256
I can't believe
that actually worked.

30:00.924 --> 30:03.759
No wallet, no ID, nothing.

30:03.760 --> 30:04.802
He's a spy.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.262
See if he has fingerprints.

30:06.263 --> 30:07.930
He has fingerprints, Amy.

30:07.931 --> 30:09.015
Switch to decaf.

30:09.016 --> 30:11.100
Hey, guys, look what
I found in this trunk.

30:11.101 --> 30:12.601
Put that down!

30:12.602 --> 30:13.437
It all makes sense.

30:13.438 --> 30:16.480
This is some
Black Ops MKUltra thing.

30:16.481 --> 30:17.940
What are you talking about?

30:17.941 --> 30:20.026
The CIA mind control program?

30:20.027 --> 30:23.029
They gave people LSD and filmed
them dorking hookers and stuff.

30:23.030 --> 30:25.906
You're saying the CIA or
the MKUltrons or whoever

30:25.907 --> 30:28.576
made a mindcontrolling
video game that kills people

30:28.577 --> 30:30.202
and they left it
here at Wilma's.

30:30.203 --> 30:32.872
In Beaverton.

30:32.873 --> 30:34.791
 You should run, children.

30:36.168 --> 30:38.252
It won't save you,

30:38.253 --> 30:41.130
but it might just
buy you some time.

30:41.131 --> 30:42.298
It's the game, right?

30:42.299 --> 30:43.967
How do we stop it?

30:44.968 --> 30:49.973
No, that's not
how this is played.

30:51.141 --> 30:53.100
You're already dead.

30:53.101 --> 30:54.810
There has to be a way.

30:54.811 --> 30:57.146
If there is, let me know.

30:57.147 --> 30:59.648
I'll put it in my report.

30:59.649 --> 31:02.651
My... guys, you're
gonna want to look at this.

31:02.652 --> 31:03.819
Look here.

31:03.820 --> 31:06.322
Sunnyvale, California,
summer 1978.

31:06.323 --> 31:09.658
17 were found dead at
Sinnesloschen Software.

31:09.659 --> 31:11.285
"Documents recovered
at the scene reference"

31:11.286 --> 31:12.995
a new game prototype,

31:12.996 --> 31:14.663
"Polybius."

31:14.664 --> 31:16.499
July 1979.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.334
It was found at a movie
theater in Colorado Springs.

31:18.335 --> 31:20.586
Eight confirmed dead.

31:20.587 --> 31:23.839
Then in a laundrymat
in Seattle, 1982.

31:23.840 --> 31:26.884
"Agency commences
Level 5 blackout."

31:26.885 --> 31:28.636
My God.

31:28.637 --> 31:30.513
He doesn't even know what it is.

31:30.514 --> 31:32.181
He's just cleaning up its mess,

31:32.182 --> 31:34.100
sweeping it under the rug.

31:34.101 --> 31:35.518
Why are you doing this?

31:35.519 --> 31:38.813
Because some things are
beyond comprehension.

31:38.814 --> 31:42.441
They cannot be stopped
nor controlled.

31:42.442 --> 31:45.444
The only way people
can sleep at night

31:45.445 --> 31:51.075
is if they can pretend
they didn't exist.

31:51.076 --> 31:53.327
My colleagues and I

31:53.328 --> 31:56.664
facilitate this process

31:56.665 --> 32:00.794
by any means necessary.

32:03.130 --> 32:05.132
Well, if they didn't
build it, then who did?

32:06.716 --> 32:08.592
No way.

32:08.593 --> 32:10.637
Now, will you let me go.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.728
Our souls are his.

32:26.560 --> 32:28.185
Now yousit.

32:28.186 --> 32:29.270
Wilma, please, just put.

32:29.271 --> 32:30.730
Shut up!

32:32.816 --> 32:35.317
He'll be here soon.

32:35.318 --> 32:37.111
I can't let you leave.

32:37.112 --> 32:40.322
lf I let you leave, he comes
Who?

32:40.323 --> 32:41.825
Who's coming?

32:44.244 --> 32:46.745
It's not my fault.

32:46.746 --> 32:48.456
It's just a game.

32:49.749 --> 32:52.459
How was I supposed to know
it was gonna hurt people?

32:52.460 --> 32:54.337
Wilma, please,
you don't have to.

32:58.758 --> 33:00.342
You were there,

33:00.343 --> 33:02.094
at Sinnesloschen.

33:02.095 --> 33:05.598
You helped them create
the game, didn't you?

33:05.599 --> 33:07.892
Back in 1978.

33:07.893 --> 33:09.602
I was the best
programmer they had

33:09.603 --> 33:13.522
in that shithole of a place.

33:13.523 --> 33:15.774
You've heard of Rabbit Run?

33:15.775 --> 33:17.610
That was mine.

33:17.611 --> 33:19.612
Xenoblaster too.

33:19.613 --> 33:22.406
Did I get any credit, no.

33:22.407 --> 33:25.326
Sometimes, ideas just
pop into your head.

33:25.327 --> 33:28.538
They come from
someplace, some...

33:31.082 --> 33:32.708
other dimension.

33:32.709 --> 33:34.753
A little voice
whispered in my ear.

33:38.506 --> 33:40.591
Polybius.

33:40.592 --> 33:42.969
It used me to make itself.

33:46.139 --> 33:48.891
I just set it free.

33:48.892 --> 33:50.517
And now what?

33:50.518 --> 33:52.019
You're feeding it.

33:52.020 --> 33:53.979
Sunnyvale, Portland?

33:53.980 --> 33:57.024
You take it from place
to place so it can kill.

33:57.025 --> 33:59.360
I'm sorry.

33:59.361 --> 34:01.904
I really am.

34:01.905 --> 34:03.447
But I've seen what
he does to people

34:03.448 --> 34:06.034
and I'm not gonna
let that happen to me.

34:08.453 --> 34:10.621
We have an understanding.

34:14.833 --> 34:17.462
You're a real bitch, lady.

34:26.638 --> 34:28.848
Come to me.

34:32.351 --> 34:33.311
No!

34:33.312 --> 34:35.897
He's here.

34:37.190 --> 34:38.942
My baby.

35:07.012 --> 35:09.472
No!

35:17.814 --> 35:18.856
No!

35:18.857 --> 35:20.232
No!

35:20.233 --> 35:23.528
Leave my friend alone,
you ugly piece of.

35:25.238 --> 35:29.034
No, Amy, no!

35:33.663 --> 35:35.415
No!

35:37.751 --> 35:39.544
No, Amy!

35:42.047 --> 35:44.966
Hey, asshole!

35:51.640 --> 35:52.681
Amy! Come on!

35:52.682 --> 35:54.433
Amy! Come on, we have to go!

35:54.434 --> 35:55.934
She's gone!

35:55.935 --> 35:57.603
Amy! Andrew, we gotta go!

35:57.604 --> 35:59.647
She's gone, let's go!

35:59.648 --> 36:01.149
Amy! Let's go!

36:04.235 --> 36:06.820
Come on, go, go!

36:06.821 --> 36:08.781
Jess, Jess! Come on, let's go!

36:08.782 --> 36:09.948
Go where?

36:09.949 --> 36:11.784
As far away from that
thing as we can get.

36:11.785 --> 36:13.494
It's just gonna catch up to us.

36:13.495 --> 36:14.828
Well, then we'll
go somewhere else.

36:14.829 --> 36:16.789
I can't, Jess, I'm done running.

36:16.790 --> 36:19.249
Well, then you're gonna
end up just like Amy.

36:19.250 --> 36:20.501
We are like Amy.

36:20.502 --> 36:21.710
She's dead, Jess.

36:21.711 --> 36:22.795
And so is the next poor chump

36:22.796 --> 36:24.546
in the next hick town
that Wilma goes to,

36:24.547 --> 36:25.964
unless we put a stop to it.

36:25.965 --> 36:29.301
But it's suicide, man!
Then we're dead either way.

36:29.302 --> 36:30.636
You're right.

36:30.637 --> 36:32.805
Live in the moment,
it's what you said.

36:32.806 --> 36:34.432
This moment, Jess.

36:36.226 --> 36:38.811
Together, we can.

36:38.812 --> 36:42.940
If you wanna get yourself
killed, then go right ahead.

36:42.941 --> 36:45.359
But you're on your own.

36:45.360 --> 36:47.112
I love you, Jess.

36:49.906 --> 36:51.490
And I know you don't feel
the same way about me

36:51.491 --> 36:53.325
and that's fine.

36:53.326 --> 36:55.828
But I'm tired of hiding.

36:55.829 --> 36:58.997
From who I am, from everything.

36:58.998 --> 37:01.166
I don't know what's gonna
happen when I go back in there,

37:01.167 --> 37:02.043
but whatever it is,

37:02.044 --> 37:04.878
it's better than what
I've been living.

37:04.879 --> 37:07.173
Please don't make me
face it alone.

37:09.676 --> 37:11.636
I'm sorry.

37:13.096 --> 37:14.723
But Jess!

37:47.505 --> 37:48.965
I'm in the game.

37:50.967 --> 37:53.928
Okay, let's get this over with.

38:40.558 --> 38:44.187
Your souls are mine.

38:52.028 --> 38:52.779
Jess!

38:52.780 --> 38:54.112
You came back. I thought about

38:54.113 --> 38:55.531
what you said, okay?

38:55.532 --> 38:56.740
You were right.

38:56.741 --> 38:59.284
You gotta live in the moment,
man, I'm through running.

38:59.285 --> 39:00.370
I'm through with.

39:01.454 --> 39:03.121
Holy shit, it's
the monster, man!

39:03.122 --> 39:04.998
Yeah, no shit, dude,
did you come with a plan?

39:04.999 --> 39:06.333
Not exactly.

39:06.334 --> 39:07.293
Well, the cabinet's
indestructible,

39:07.294 --> 39:08.460
we've gotta find another way.

39:08.461 --> 39:10.547
You better think fast,
any bright ideas?

39:13.091 --> 39:16.593
No, but I just came up
with a really stupid one.

39:16.594 --> 39:18.887
We don't destroy the cabinet,
we destroy the game.

39:18.888 --> 39:20.430
Rack up enough points,
crash the program,

39:20.431 --> 39:21.974
a kill screen.

39:21.975 --> 39:24.017
Quarters, I need
quarters, come on!

39:24.018 --> 39:25.520
It's my last one.

39:28.314 --> 39:29.899
Make it count.

39:31.901 --> 39:33.151
Hey, ugly!

39:33.152 --> 39:34.612
Come and get me.

40:01.639 --> 40:03.807
Come on!

40:03.808 --> 40:05.226
Come get some!

40:05.977 --> 40:07.312
Over here!

40:13.026 --> 40:14.360
Come on, man!

40:15.528 --> 40:17.822
Shit, no, no, no, no, no.

40:20.658 --> 40:21.910
No!

40:30.627 --> 40:32.795
No, no, no!

40:43.514 --> 40:45.349
No!

40:45.350 --> 40:46.350
No!

40:47.852 --> 40:49.561
Andrew!

40:49.562 --> 40:51.981
Andrew, he's coming for you!

41:14.420 --> 41:16.089
Yes, yes, come on!

42:30.163 --> 42:31.622
No!

42:34.876 --> 42:37.085
Amy!

42:37.086 --> 42:38.588
Hit the bricks, Wilma.

42:45.219 --> 42:48.013
 You okay?

42:48.014 --> 42:50.183
Yeah.

42:54.353 --> 42:56.313
Let's get the hell outta here.

42:56.314 --> 42:57.814
Geez, the way you
dips are acting,

42:57.815 --> 43:01.068
you'd think I died or something.

43:01.069 --> 43:02.194
You know what?

43:02.195 --> 43:04.654
Beaverton sucks.

43:04.655 --> 43:06.375
I was actually gonna
say it's growing on me.

43:07.408 --> 43:08.742
Do you guys wanna
play some video games?

43:08.743 --> 43:09.660
No! No!

43:09.661 --> 43:11.913
You sure? Yes!

43:39.107 --> 43:40.273
"Polybius."

43:40.274 --> 43:42.901
A review by Andrew Myers.

43:42.902 --> 43:45.654
Life is a lot like maze games.

43:45.655 --> 43:49.282
They're cruel, they're hard...

43:49.283 --> 43:52.536
and no matter what, you die.

43:52.537 --> 43:53.745
Now, given all that,

43:53.746 --> 43:55.413
you have two basic options.

43:55.414 --> 43:57.165
You can live in fear,
hide in the shadows,

43:57.166 --> 43:58.750
and die anyway,

43:58.751 --> 44:00.877
or you can stop trying
to survive your life

44:00.878 --> 44:03.088
and start trying to live it.

44:03.089 --> 44:04.422
It's not the easier choice,

44:04.423 --> 44:07.926
especially if being yourself
means being different.

44:07.927 --> 44:10.262
But it's worth it.

44:10.263 --> 44:12.305
In your darkest moments,
when you're most afraid,

44:12.306 --> 44:15.142
just remember the
two commandments.

44:15.143 --> 44:16.518
Keep thy chin up,

44:16.519 --> 44:18.312
and fight like hell.
