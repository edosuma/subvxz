WEBVTT

00:02.936 --> 00:05.139
This doesn't happen
very often, does it?

00:05.239 --> 00:06.574
Two of us,
just hanging out.

00:06.674 --> 00:07.741
I know, it's weird,
isn't it?

00:07.841 --> 00:08.742
Mm.

00:08.842 --> 00:09.777
[chuckles]

00:11.145 --> 00:12.546
Let's make sure
it never happens again.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.315
Absolutely.

00:14.415 --> 00:15.383
Hey, guys.

00:15.483 --> 00:17.085
(Will and Karen)
Oh, thank God.

00:17.185 --> 00:18.219
Coffee.

00:18.319 --> 00:19.587
Will.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.389
All of the charitable
work you've been doing

00:21.489 --> 00:24.292
for the Coalition of
Justice...has inspired me.

00:26.194 --> 00:30.164
I have volunteered to redecorate
a nursing home in Brooklyn.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.765
Thank you.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.767
I realize I haven't done
anything charitable

00:33.867 --> 00:36.070
since that time I helped
feed the homeless.

00:36.170 --> 00:39.140
You threw Skittles at a wino.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.776
He ate 'em, didn't he?

00:42.876 --> 00:45.146
But seriously, I'm--I'm
very proud of you.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.114
I'm glad you're volunteering.

00:47.348 --> 00:49.117
This is nice,
isn't it?

00:49.217 --> 00:50.784
Just the three
of us hanging out.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.253
Hmm.

00:52.353 --> 00:53.254
Hey, guys.

00:53.354 --> 00:55.123
Oh, thank God.

00:55.223 --> 00:56.757
[heavy exhale]

00:56.857 --> 00:58.092
Nice day out, huh?

00:58.192 --> 01:02.130
[coughing]

01:02.230 --> 01:04.465
Well, I gotta take
the subway to work.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.066
It's gonna take forever
to get downtown,

01:06.167 --> 01:07.501
but I have to help
my friend, Bill.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.203
Bill...

01:09.303 --> 01:11.105
Of Rights.

01:12.873 --> 01:14.074
Uhh.

01:14.175 --> 01:15.676
Maybe you didn't
hear me...

01:15.776 --> 01:17.077
but I said--

01:17.178 --> 01:18.412
[coughing]

01:18.512 --> 01:20.514
Jack, are you okay?

01:20.614 --> 01:23.417
I sick.

01:23.517 --> 01:26.086
With the Evian flu.

01:28.756 --> 01:33.093
I shared a bottle of Evian
with a stranger at the gym.

01:34.895 --> 01:38.098
Honey, if you're sick, you
should come stay at the manse

01:38.199 --> 01:39.400
for a couple days.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.202
It'd be fun, I could
take care of you.

01:41.302 --> 01:46.374
You know, chicken soup, and
comfy blankets, and leeches.

01:48.309 --> 01:50.411
Hey, we could raid my collection
of old Movies of the Week.

01:50.511 --> 01:51.212
[clapping]

01:51.312 --> 01:53.814
Oh, I love old
movies of the week.

01:53.914 --> 01:56.617
Annie Potts is never better than
when she's getting beatin' up

01:56.717 --> 01:59.153
or someone's stealin'
one of her babies.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.422
Hey, Grace, you wanna
come watch with us?

02:01.522 --> 02:03.757
Oh, that's too bad,
Jackie, let's go!

02:08.196 --> 02:09.697
Hector, I've only
got five minutes

02:09.797 --> 02:11.399
before I have to get
back to the office.

02:11.499 --> 02:13.267
I want what
I had yesterday.

02:13.367 --> 02:15.169
I don't remember what it was,
and you weren't working,

02:15.269 --> 02:16.437
but I want it anyway.

02:17.905 --> 02:19.873
Hi...Margo.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.842
From Will's law firm, right?

02:21.942 --> 02:23.211
Don't tell me.

02:23.311 --> 02:24.912
Grace Adler, Interior Designer.

02:25.012 --> 02:27.248
I remember because...

02:27.348 --> 02:30.218
you smelled like doll head.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.921
So, you can set your own budget.

02:34.021 --> 02:35.356
What do you say?

02:35.456 --> 02:36.524
About what?

02:36.624 --> 02:37.925
Oh sorry, I-I do this a lot.

02:38.025 --> 02:40.228
I-I rehearse conversations
in my head

02:40.328 --> 02:44.164
and then I can't remember if
I've actually had them or not.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.767
Listen, I want to
redo the law firm.

02:46.867 --> 02:49.370
So, you can set your own
budget, what do you say?

02:50.504 --> 02:51.505
R-Really?

02:51.605 --> 02:53.507
Wow.

02:53.607 --> 02:56.877
Oh, I just, uh, volunteered...

02:58.279 --> 02:59.613
You know what?

02:59.713 --> 03:02.182
Um, I will, I will get back
to you by this afternoon.

03:02.283 --> 03:04.585
I stopped loving
you years ago.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.223
Excuse me?

03:09.323 --> 03:11.925
Sorry...I'm having lunch
with my husband later.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.928
[upbeat jazz music]

03:15.028 --> 03:19.833
*

03:22.603 --> 03:26.740
Wow, I've never been to this
part of the manse before.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.243
Oh, well that's
the gift-wrapping room,

03:29.343 --> 03:30.678
that's the meat locker,

03:30.778 --> 03:33.314
discotheque, car wash,

03:33.414 --> 03:37.251
and then,
down here we have...

03:37.351 --> 03:41.489
liquor storage...
liquor collectibles...

03:41.589 --> 03:44.224
liquor dry goods...

03:44.325 --> 03:47.895
emergency liquors, and...

03:47.995 --> 03:49.830
Candles.

03:53.801 --> 03:54.968
Dipped in liquor.

03:57.471 --> 03:58.906
And, uh,

03:59.006 --> 04:01.475
I thought I'd set you up
here in Stan's library.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.277
Hmm.

04:03.377 --> 04:07.247
Where does this door go?

04:17.491 --> 04:18.792
What door, honey?

04:22.095 --> 04:24.031
This door.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.535
There's no door there.

04:29.069 --> 04:31.839
You need to get
your eyes checked.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.807
Why don't you go
see a optometrist.

04:33.907 --> 04:36.276
Ten doors down on the right,
just past Spencer's Gifts.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.379
Go on.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.416
Wait a minute.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.851
It's not one of
those doors you open

04:43.951 --> 04:46.019
and then fall off of the
side of the building, is it?

04:46.119 --> 04:48.689
Of course it's not!

04:48.789 --> 04:51.925
Those are all marked:
"Door sticks, push hard."

04:52.025 --> 04:53.894
Come on.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.029
Come on, Karen, I wanna know
what's behind the door!

04:57.531 --> 04:59.500
All right, I'll tell you.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.768
It's not that big of a deal,

05:00.868 --> 05:03.737
it's just that...well.

05:03.837 --> 05:08.376
That's...that's the
forbidden room.

05:08.476 --> 05:09.042
The what?

05:09.142 --> 05:12.312
The forbidden room!

05:15.849 --> 05:20.053
Wow...so dramatic.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.756
The forbidden room.

05:22.856 --> 05:26.494
Reminds me of my
nickname at camp.

05:26.594 --> 05:28.596
Forbidden Fruit.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.366
Unless I was
in a sleeping bag.

05:32.466 --> 05:33.367
Then it was...

05:33.467 --> 05:35.769
Fruit roll-up.

05:41.942 --> 05:45.913
Okay, no more ordering from
restaurants with cutesie names.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.114
You know, I mean...

05:47.214 --> 05:50.518
Curry in a Hurry,
I can deal with, but...

05:50.618 --> 05:55.088
But Tapas Don't Preach,
that's just going too far.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.624
Will.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.091
Really big news.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.362
You know your old boss, Margo.

06:02.463 --> 06:03.163
I ran into her this morning

06:03.263 --> 06:05.566
and she asked if
I would redecorate

06:05.666 --> 06:07.134
the law firm.

06:07.234 --> 06:11.439
I thought you were gonna do that
job for the nursing home.

06:11.539 --> 06:14.041
I know and I really wanted
to do it, but I can't do both,

06:14.141 --> 06:16.009
and Margo said that the budget
would be unlimited.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.078
Ha ha!

06:18.178 --> 06:21.381
The only thing unlimited at
the nursing home is apple sauce

06:21.482 --> 06:23.817
between 2:00 and 4:00.

06:23.917 --> 06:26.520
Well, I-I-I thought
you said I inspired you

06:26.620 --> 06:28.656
to finally do something
charitable with your life.

06:28.756 --> 06:30.157
Well, you did.

06:30.257 --> 06:33.461
And then it went away.

06:33.561 --> 06:36.396
Do I have to remind you
that I quit

06:36.497 --> 06:38.832
that heartless, money-grubbing
corporate law firm

06:38.932 --> 06:40.033
and now you're choosing it?

06:40.133 --> 06:42.436
O-Over sweet elderly people
who just want to live out

06:42.536 --> 06:44.404
the rest of their days
with dignity?

06:44.505 --> 06:46.574
Nice!

06:48.141 --> 06:50.744
When you say it like
that, I feel awful.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.446
Well, you should, Grace.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.748
I mean, I was proud of you
for doing something meaningful.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.650
You were?
Yes!

06:56.750 --> 06:59.587
God.

07:02.590 --> 07:04.424
Okay, I won't take the job.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.628
Okay?

07:07.728 --> 07:10.430
I finally committed
to doing something charitable,

07:10.531 --> 07:11.765
and I'm going
to see it through.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.133
That's my Grace.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.735
You're a good person.

07:14.835 --> 07:16.003
Just like Jake Gyllenhall.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.807
Sometimes when I look at
my screensaver, I think:

07:19.907 --> 07:24.978
Yeah, you're thinking
about me too.

07:25.078 --> 07:28.448
You know what, I used to be that
way about Sarah Jessica Parker.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.651
But then, we shared
an elevator ride together

07:30.751 --> 07:32.720
and she poked me
in the boob with her umbrella

07:32.820 --> 07:35.222
and didn't apologize.

07:35.322 --> 07:40.460
Were you trying
to hug her?

07:41.995 --> 07:43.964
That's not important.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.536
(Jack)
Thanks, Kare.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.170
Oh.

07:50.270 --> 07:53.206
BTW...

07:53.306 --> 07:55.709
I think I figured out what's
in the forbidden room.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.713
It's my birthday
present, isn't it?

07:59.813 --> 08:03.884
Damn it, Jack,
you are just too smart!

08:03.984 --> 08:07.087
Something I've been
excused of many times.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.158
Mr. Stan is upset.

08:11.258 --> 08:13.193
He can't fit
in his skinny jeans.

08:15.295 --> 08:17.230
That man.

08:17.330 --> 08:21.201
He wakes up one morning, can see
his feet, and he gets all cocky.

08:23.203 --> 08:27.675
Now, you stay in bed and stop
thinking about your present.

08:27.775 --> 08:30.210
Hi, Rosie.

08:30.310 --> 08:31.211
[patting on the sofa]

08:31.311 --> 08:33.547
Asta mañana.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.086
So.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.854
We haven't talked
in a while.

08:40.954 --> 08:43.090
How are you?

08:43.190 --> 08:44.825
Hmm, not so good.

08:44.925 --> 08:46.159
My uncle died--

08:46.259 --> 08:48.862
I don't care.
Uh, uh--

08:48.962 --> 08:50.297
What did Karen get me
for my birthday?

08:50.397 --> 08:51.732
Nothing yet.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.001
But she's looking at
the L.L. Bean catalogue.

08:54.101 --> 08:57.270
What size duck boot
do you wear?

08:57.370 --> 08:59.272
But wait, if she didn't
get me anything yet,

08:59.372 --> 09:00.708
what's she hiding
in that room?

09:00.808 --> 09:02.042
What room?

09:02.142 --> 09:03.543
You know.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.112
[whispering]
The forbidden room.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.682
I never heard of
a room like that.

09:08.782 --> 09:11.118
And unless you want to
get yourself killed,

09:11.218 --> 09:12.853
you haven't heard
it either.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.788
Rosie, wait.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.790
I've already said too much.
Don't follow me.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.759
Oh come on, you know
you can't outrun me.

09:26.667 --> 09:29.837
I'm so pleased you decided
to accept this job, Grace.

09:29.937 --> 09:30.904
I am too.

09:31.004 --> 09:31.972
[laughing]

09:32.840 --> 09:34.775
Yeah, I can do
a nursing home anytime.

09:34.808 --> 09:37.210
It's just...plastic fichus
trees and rubber mats.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.079
Oh, but listen.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.882
If you need to call me,
don't call me at home.

09:41.982 --> 09:44.618
Use the cell
or the office,

09:44.718 --> 09:47.688
but not home...
never home.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.623
You're hiding something.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.725
And I bet it's
wickedly evil.

09:51.825 --> 09:54.628
You know, I belong to
a secret club downtown

09:54.728 --> 09:56.163
that recruits
young women--

09:56.263 --> 09:57.798
O-kay, wow.

09:57.898 --> 09:59.667
Great, okay.

09:59.767 --> 10:00.668
Good, Margo.

10:00.768 --> 10:01.869
Let's-let's um,

10:02.870 --> 10:05.105
let's talk about what
you want for your office.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.675
I'm not sure what you mean when
you say tasteful bloodbath.

10:10.343 --> 10:11.812
So, Will.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.681
You quit your, uh,
stupid charity job

10:13.781 --> 10:15.683
to come back to
corporate law, huh?

10:15.783 --> 10:17.617
And you didn't
even tell Grace.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.619
How do you know?

10:19.720 --> 10:21.021
Well, whenever she calls
you answer the phone:

10:21.121 --> 10:22.690
"The Coalition
for Justice."

10:24.124 --> 10:25.392
What's the matter, Will?

10:25.492 --> 10:26.960
You ashamed that you
didn't save the world?

10:27.060 --> 10:29.129
Hey, I'm still
doing noble work.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.398
Now come on,
let's get cracking.

10:31.498 --> 10:33.066
We have a power plant
to defend

10:33.166 --> 10:35.736
against a very whiny
elementary school.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.238
I'll be right back, Margo.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.744
[sugar packet shaking]

10:59.459 --> 11:01.061
Woo-woo!

11:01.161 --> 11:03.096
[whistles]

11:03.196 --> 11:04.364
[gobbling noise]

11:07.968 --> 11:10.303
[doorknob rattling]

11:10.403 --> 11:12.172
What am I thinking?

11:12.272 --> 11:18.011
I have a bobby pin.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.213
[sighs]

11:20.313 --> 11:21.749
There.

11:21.849 --> 11:24.317
Can't do anything
with hair in my face.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.754
Hey, what the hell are
you doing by that door?

11:26.854 --> 11:27.755
[gasps]

11:27.855 --> 11:30.190
Look how pretty!

11:32.292 --> 11:35.128
I can finally see your face.

11:37.264 --> 11:39.299
Come on, honey,
let's get back in bed.

11:39.399 --> 11:42.302
Why do you keep trying
to spoil your birthday present?

11:42.402 --> 11:44.437
Karen, I know the truth.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.207
Rosie spilled the beans.

11:47.307 --> 11:50.944
Then she told me there's
no present in there.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.080
Now I demand you tell me
what's behind that door!

11:53.180 --> 11:54.748
Honey, I don't
want you to know.

11:54.848 --> 11:57.184
But we're friends, we're
not supposed to have secrets.

11:57.284 --> 11:58.485
Yeah, well guess what,
we do.

11:59.586 --> 12:00.954
What's behind that door
is none of your business.

12:00.988 --> 12:01.121
Fine!!

12:04.557 --> 12:07.160
You have a secret.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.329
I have to respect that.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.364
Truth is...

12:11.464 --> 12:14.201
I have a secret too.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.369
You're trapped,
I'm going behind that door!

12:16.469 --> 12:19.372
Oh my God,
I am trapped!

12:22.342 --> 12:25.345
Well, I guess
I could move these.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.080
Jackie, nooooo!

12:27.180 --> 12:29.249
crash!
(Jack)
Ugh!

12:29.349 --> 12:33.353
Why...are...you...so...strong?

12:33.453 --> 12:37.357
And, Rosie so fast?

12:37.457 --> 12:41.962
What is this place?

12:42.062 --> 12:43.130
Ahh.

12:43.230 --> 12:44.364
[heavy breathing]

12:44.464 --> 12:45.365
Great!

12:45.465 --> 12:48.768
My forbidden doorknob.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.470
All right,
fine, you win.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.973
Too sick to fight.

12:53.073 --> 12:55.342
I won't go in your
new little door--

12:55.442 --> 12:57.010
thud!

12:58.345 --> 13:02.082
Oh, my God!

13:02.182 --> 13:03.817
(Grace)
And then I was thinking,
on the walls

13:03.917 --> 13:08.388
we could hang photographs
from famous landmark cases

13:08.488 --> 13:10.323
like, you know, um.

13:10.423 --> 13:12.792
Or we could just
paint them all.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.464
I know I've said this,
like, a thousand times,

13:17.564 --> 13:22.235
but, Grace, you remind me
so much of my sister.

13:22.335 --> 13:25.805
They never found
her killer.

13:27.875 --> 13:30.410
Thank you?

13:30.510 --> 13:31.578
I'm gonna go get my, um,

13:31.678 --> 13:33.413
paint samples.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.115
Oh, no.

13:35.215 --> 13:36.816
I left them at home.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.085
Oh, I'll swing by later.

13:38.185 --> 13:41.154
I'm having an affair
with a guy on 73rd St.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.423
No, you can't.

13:43.523 --> 13:47.260
Why not, I'm not
getting any at home.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.263
Uh, no, I mean, you can't
come to my house.

13:50.363 --> 13:53.166
I-I know this may
sound strange,

13:53.266 --> 13:55.468
but I haven't told Will
that I'm working here.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.237
I don't understand.

13:57.337 --> 14:02.175
You know how Will is working
for the Coalition for Justice?

14:02.275 --> 14:05.445
Really, he's working for
the Coalition for Justice.

14:05.545 --> 14:09.449
Seems like only minutes ago
I saw him in the break room.

14:09.549 --> 14:13.453
I know, he's, he's
such a good person.

14:13.553 --> 14:16.289
Anyway, um.

14:16.389 --> 14:19.459
I told him that I wasn't
taking this job,

14:19.559 --> 14:23.363
so I'd prefer if we could
keep it between us.

14:23.463 --> 14:24.932
Of course, we're like
sisters, you know,

14:25.032 --> 14:27.000
if one of us hadn't
been murdered.

14:28.601 --> 14:33.040
Listen, would you mind waiting
here for me for a minute?

14:33.140 --> 14:35.208
There's something
I need to check on.

14:35.308 --> 14:36.576
(Margo)
I need to talk to you.

14:36.676 --> 14:38.411
Gary, get back to your hole.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.183
[door closes]

14:43.283 --> 14:44.517
Will.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.020
You were aware that I offered
Grace a job, weren't you?

14:47.988 --> 14:49.089
Oh yeah, yeah, she--she
couldn't take it.

14:49.189 --> 14:50.423
Oh, why not?

14:50.523 --> 14:52.392
Do you know?

14:52.492 --> 14:54.394
Well, yeah, she volunteered to,
uh, redecorate a nursing home.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.396
Oh.
She's such
a good person.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.365
You both are.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.000
Wait here, I wanna
show you something.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.368
Sure, Margo.

15:04.137 --> 15:08.475
This is unbelievable!

15:08.575 --> 15:10.177
A baby's room?

15:10.277 --> 15:13.513
Why do you have a baby's room?

15:13.613 --> 15:14.681
I don't wanna talk about it.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.417
You've seen it, now
let's get out of here.

15:17.450 --> 15:18.485
But, Karen, you could
tell me anything.

15:18.585 --> 15:19.486
[foot stamps]

15:19.586 --> 15:20.487
No.

15:20.587 --> 15:21.554
Please?

15:21.654 --> 15:23.290
All right,
you've worn me down!

15:23.390 --> 15:25.492
[sighs]

15:25.592 --> 15:28.595
Remember a few years ago when
I thought I was pregnant?

15:28.695 --> 15:33.033
Well, before I found out
it was a false alarm,

15:33.133 --> 15:35.435
I had this room turned
into a nursery.

15:37.204 --> 15:38.471
Haven't been in it since.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.241
Karen.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.442
You want a baby.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.577
No, I don't.

15:44.677 --> 15:47.114
I don't know.

15:47.214 --> 15:50.417
Sometimes I do think about
how sweet it would be

15:50.517 --> 15:53.320
to see my child smear
on my make-up

15:53.420 --> 15:57.190
and teeter around
in my high heels.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.560
And if it was a girl,
that'd be okay too.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.398
Aww.

16:05.498 --> 16:08.435
See, now that's why
I didn't want to tell you.

16:08.535 --> 16:10.670
'Cause I didn't want to have
to see that pity puss.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.672
Karen, I don't pity you.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.041
Yes, you do.

16:14.141 --> 16:15.608
Poor little rich girl.

16:15.708 --> 16:18.578
Wants the one thing
she'll never have.

16:18.678 --> 16:23.583
It's so Farrah Fawcett
in Poor Little Rich Girl.

16:23.683 --> 16:26.586
Or, Meredith Baxter Birney

16:26.686 --> 16:29.256
in The One Thing
She'll Never Have.

16:29.356 --> 16:33.293
Karen, I think you're being
too hard on yourself.

16:33.393 --> 16:35.495
Like Joanna Kerns in--

16:35.595 --> 16:38.498
Too Hard on Herself.

16:39.466 --> 16:41.568
Maybe.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.603
But come on, Jackie.

16:43.703 --> 16:46.106
What kind of mother
would I make?

16:46.206 --> 16:48.608
I'm impatient, I'm selfish.

16:48.708 --> 16:52.512
I mean, can I really take care
of another human being?

16:52.612 --> 16:55.615
I'm not exactly
the maternal type.

16:55.715 --> 16:58.485
But, Karen--
[coughing]

16:58.585 --> 16:59.552
[clears throat]

16:59.652 --> 17:02.055
You do not sound good,
come here.

17:04.591 --> 17:08.595
Oh, for Pete's sake,
you're burning up.

17:08.695 --> 17:13.032
Now, you get your kiester
back into bed, young man.

17:13.133 --> 17:18.138
* Hush, little gay boy,
don't you... *

17:21.408 --> 17:23.210
Grace, um.

17:23.310 --> 17:26.179
Will you step into
the break room for a minute?

17:26.279 --> 17:27.647
Sure.
I'll be right in.

17:28.915 --> 17:31.384
I think you will find something
to keep you occupied.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.821
I guess that's
only funny to me.

17:34.921 --> 17:36.123
Right now.

17:39.126 --> 17:41.194
Oh, crap.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.072
Ugh.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.145
There you go.
Oh, thank you.

17:58.245 --> 18:01.348
Ahhhh!
Ahhhh!

18:01.448 --> 18:02.849
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?

18:02.949 --> 18:04.551
Are you working here?
Are you working here?

18:04.651 --> 18:05.652
You lied to me!
You lied to me!

18:05.752 --> 18:07.420
[two cracks]
Ow!
Ow!

18:07.520 --> 18:08.688
Me?

18:08.788 --> 18:10.423
Wha-how long have
you been working here?

18:10.523 --> 18:12.359
And why didn't you tell me?

18:12.459 --> 18:13.693
I--was going to.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.362
Eventually.

18:16.629 --> 18:17.630
Like, when--when we're old and
living in th-that nursing home

18:18.465 --> 18:19.666
you're supposed
to be redecorating!

18:19.699 --> 18:20.367
Don't you make this about me!

18:20.467 --> 18:21.868
D--

18:21.968 --> 18:23.436
[sighs]

18:23.536 --> 18:26.173
I was, I really wanted
to tell you, it's--

18:26.273 --> 18:28.775
But you were so proud of me.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.344
You know, and I made a big deal
about doing charity work.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.679
But, Grace, that office.

18:32.779 --> 18:33.780
It--

18:33.880 --> 18:36.649
It smelled like
soy cheese and Raid.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.819
And I-I--

18:39.919 --> 18:41.388
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

18:41.488 --> 18:42.855
And maybe it makes
me a bad person,

18:42.955 --> 18:46.293
But I-I like doing
corporate law.

18:46.393 --> 18:50.397
And I love doing it
someplace pretty.

18:50.497 --> 18:52.265
I know you do.

18:53.433 --> 18:57.570
And you could never
disappoint me.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.272
You know what?

18:59.372 --> 19:03.176
I'm going to make
your office super pretty.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.211
Yeah, about that.

19:04.311 --> 19:05.278
Okay, fine.

19:05.378 --> 19:06.679
I took the job.

19:06.779 --> 19:09.482
And I didn't tell you
because, blah, blah, blah,

19:09.582 --> 19:11.584
disappoint you, blah,
blah, guilt, blah, blah,

19:11.684 --> 19:13.152
old people freak me out,

19:13.253 --> 19:17.690
blah, blah...sorry.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.559
Aww, that was beautiful.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.494
You know, if I had known we
were going to do blah blahs,

19:21.594 --> 19:23.230
I could have done that whole
speech a whole lot shorter,

19:23.330 --> 19:24.531
you know.

19:24.631 --> 19:25.732
Never go first, Will.

19:25.832 --> 19:26.799
Mmm.

19:28.735 --> 19:29.902
Grace?

19:30.002 --> 19:31.538
Yeah, baby?

19:31.638 --> 19:33.206
What the hell
are you wearing?

19:36.676 --> 19:38.345
Hey, Karen.

19:38.445 --> 19:39.779
Sorry, I--

19:39.879 --> 19:41.180
I should have minded
my own business.

19:41.281 --> 19:42.181
N-n-n-no.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.750
Honey, forget about it.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.952
I'm glad that you
made me come in here.

19:46.052 --> 19:47.720
Yeah.

19:47.820 --> 19:50.189
I think I'm finally
ready to let go.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.191
You know what,
I'm gonna turn this room

19:52.292 --> 19:55.762
into something practical,
like...liquor storage.

19:55.862 --> 19:58.698
We just do not
have the space.

20:00.567 --> 20:02.435
Hey, you know.

20:02.535 --> 20:03.470
Just a thought,
Kare, but...

20:03.570 --> 20:05.838
maybe you should keep it
like this for a while.

20:05.938 --> 20:08.275
Oh, yeah.

20:08.375 --> 20:09.876
Well, maybe I will.

20:09.976 --> 20:12.912
You know, just for
a little while.

20:31.030 --> 20:32.299
Back to my office.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.401
I want it--I want it
to look masculine.

20:34.501 --> 20:37.837
Then stay out of it.

20:37.937 --> 20:40.740
Good. You've worked it out.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.542
On company time.

20:42.642 --> 20:45.912
Really, what kind of
relationship do you two have

20:46.012 --> 20:47.814
that you can't be honest
with each other?

20:47.914 --> 20:48.915
It's disgraceful.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.717
[cell phone ringing]

20:50.817 --> 20:52.885
Margo.

20:52.985 --> 20:54.687
Oh, hello, dear.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.589
[whispers]
My husband.

20:56.689 --> 21:00.427
Yes, yes,
Florida's beautiful.

21:00.527 --> 21:02.362
In fact, I'm in the water
right now.

21:02.462 --> 21:02.562
[water sloshing]
