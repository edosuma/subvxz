11:18.781 --> 11:19.920
- Got no way of knowing.

11:19.955 --> 11:21.784
Did you get 'ere alright?

11:21.819 --> 11:23.234
- Oh yeah, fine, thank you.

11:23.268 --> 11:24.338
- You got the
instructions there?

11:24.373 --> 11:25.408
- I certainly did.

11:25.443 --> 11:26.755
Oh my God it was so amazing.

11:26.789 --> 11:28.791
Was like a proper treasure hunt!

11:28.826 --> 11:30.690
I felt like I was
a spy or something.

11:30.724 --> 11:31.656
- Nice one.

11:31.691 --> 11:32.761
- Like what was that
about not being able

11:32.795 --> 11:34.003
to talk to anyone
on the way here--

11:34.038 --> 11:34.763
[banging]

11:34.797 --> 11:36.281
What's that?

11:36.316 --> 11:39.733
- These windows are
totally closed up.

11:39.768 --> 11:40.734
- [Ron] Oh yeah.

11:40.769 --> 11:41.701
- [Abbi] No ways.

11:41.735 --> 11:43.081
- [Ron] I suppose
they don't want us

11:43.116 --> 11:45.256
looking out at the road.

11:45.290 --> 11:46.464
- Yeah.

11:46.498 --> 11:48.017
- [Ron] Yeah,
that'll be it, yeah.

11:48.052 --> 11:50.986
- God, not being able
to bring my phone!

11:51.020 --> 11:53.333
I almost went mad on the train.

11:53.367 --> 11:54.783
It was a nightmare.

11:54.817 --> 11:57.095
Everyone was on their
phones, literally everyone.

11:57.130 --> 11:58.718
You don't realize till you
don't have one, do you?

11:58.752 --> 12:00.547
- Absolutely, we
don't realize how much

12:00.581 --> 12:02.480
we all depend on our
phones, do we, these days?

12:02.514 --> 12:03.999
- Well that's it isn't it?

12:04.033 --> 12:04.896
Addicted.

12:06.415 --> 12:08.555
- So, did you have
to travel far then?

12:08.589 --> 12:11.247
- Oh not too far, I'm from
Whitely, near Southampton.

12:11.282 --> 12:13.008
- Oh yeah, down
near Southampton.

12:13.042 --> 12:14.664
- Yeah.
- I been to Southampton.

12:14.699 --> 12:16.114
- Oh, you been there before.

12:16.149 --> 12:17.150
- My grandma used to live there.

12:17.184 --> 12:19.773
- Ah yeah, it's alright.

12:19.808 --> 12:22.776
But my God, I've had an
absolute nightmare of a day.

12:22.811 --> 12:23.950
- Oh yeah, how come?

12:23.984 --> 12:25.399
- 'Cause my Mum wanted
to come with me,

12:25.434 --> 12:27.022
'cause, obviously, she thinks
I'm going to Australia.

12:27.056 --> 12:28.299
- Australia!

12:28.333 --> 12:30.750
- Yeah, I know, that's
what everyone thinks.

12:30.784 --> 12:33.269
So she wanted to give me
a lift to the airport.

12:33.304 --> 12:34.926
And I was like, oh
no, it's alright,

12:34.961 --> 12:36.169
I'm gonna get the train.

12:36.203 --> 12:38.205
Then she was like gonna get
Nick to drive to the airport

12:38.240 --> 12:39.966
anyway, and I was like no,

12:40.000 --> 12:42.831
and she just weren't
taking no for an answer!

12:42.865 --> 12:46.110
In the end I was like: look
mum, I'm gonna do this my way,

12:46.144 --> 12:49.251
I'm gonna get the
train to the airport,

12:49.285 --> 12:51.322
you can give me a lift to the
train station if you want.

12:51.356 --> 12:53.496
And then on the way
there she getting Nick

12:53.531 --> 12:54.808
to drive to the airport anyway!

12:54.843 --> 12:56.465
I was like: no!

12:56.499 --> 12:59.675
Oh my god, I completely
lost it at her!

12:59.709 --> 13:00.918
God, yeah.

13:00.952 --> 13:02.816
You know, that made me
almost miss my train.

13:02.851 --> 13:07.545
God, it was just, it just
wasn't how I wanted to leave it,

13:07.579 --> 13:08.788
you know, as I was going.

13:09.927 --> 13:12.930
God, she knew something
weird was going on.

13:12.964 --> 13:14.345
You know how mums just know.

13:14.379 --> 13:16.002
- Oh yeah.

13:16.036 --> 13:17.693
- I guess actually
now you do know Mum.

13:17.727 --> 13:18.798
- She knows.

13:18.832 --> 13:21.283
- Sorry about that.
[laughing]

13:21.317 --> 13:23.561
- God, she was a bag of
tears at the train station.

13:23.595 --> 13:24.631
- Aw, bless her.

13:24.665 --> 13:26.184
- I was just so,
give it a break.

13:26.219 --> 13:27.427
- Yeah, I had to tell my wife

13:27.461 --> 13:28.980
I was going on this
training course--

13:29.015 --> 13:31.327
- Oh!
- Hi.

13:32.363 --> 13:33.674
- Look, I've been given this.

13:33.709 --> 13:35.884
And, I've been told to
lock the door with this.

13:35.918 --> 13:37.851
[group exclaiming]

13:37.886 --> 13:38.818
Here we go, here we go!

13:40.302 --> 13:42.062
- Sorry, who did you see?

13:42.097 --> 13:43.546
- Oh, there was a guy out there,

13:43.581 --> 13:44.754
stopped me on the steps up here.

13:44.789 --> 13:45.825
- What did he say?

13:45.859 --> 13:47.723
- Not much, he told me
I was the last one in

13:47.757 --> 13:48.966
and he gave me this.
- Last one.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.726
And told me to lock the
door when I got inside.

13:50.760 --> 13:52.452
- No way.
- This is it.

13:52.486 --> 13:53.315
- That's what he said.

13:53.349 --> 13:54.592
- Hi, I'm Abbi by the way.

13:54.626 --> 13:55.489
- Hi, I'm James.

13:55.524 --> 13:56.594
- James.
- Hi, I'm Ron.

13:56.628 --> 13:57.491
- Ron.
- James, hello.

13:57.526 --> 13:58.354
- Marcus.

13:58.389 --> 13:59.390
- James.

13:59.424 --> 14:00.356
- [Ron] Right then!

14:00.391 --> 14:02.082
- Come take a seat, join us.

14:05.120 --> 14:05.983
- What's in the envelope?

14:06.017 --> 14:07.087
- [James] Oh, I
haven't looked yet.

14:07.122 --> 14:08.157
- [Abbi] Oh God, yeah.

14:08.192 --> 14:09.124
Oooh, more laminate!
- There's this.

14:09.987 --> 14:11.195
Something else as well.

14:11.229 --> 14:12.230
There we go.

14:12.265 --> 14:13.507
And--
- Are they microphones?

14:13.542 --> 14:14.336
- Yeah they are.

14:14.370 --> 14:15.785
- That was it.

14:15.820 --> 14:19.444
- [Abbi] Shit, we've
gotta put on microphones.

14:19.479 --> 14:21.515
- I've used those
microphones before.

14:21.550 --> 14:22.723
- Oh have you?
- So exciting.

14:22.758 --> 14:24.553
- Used them at a conference.

14:24.587 --> 14:26.037
- Oh really.
- James?

14:26.072 --> 14:27.176
- James.

14:27.211 --> 14:29.627
- James, yeah Marcus.
[Ron mumbling]

14:29.661 --> 14:30.835
- Hello testing, one, two.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.009
- [Abbi] How does it clip on?

14:32.043 --> 14:34.183
- Just sort of clips on.

14:34.218 --> 14:35.460
- [Ron] This is Ron
Weatherall speaking,

14:35.495 --> 14:36.496
hello, hello, hello.

14:37.462 --> 14:38.601
- What's this?

14:38.636 --> 14:39.533
What is that?

14:39.568 --> 14:40.500
- [Ron] Task one.

14:40.534 --> 14:41.950
- [Abbi] Task, oh my
God, we get a task.

14:41.984 --> 14:43.158
- Shall I do the honors.

14:43.192 --> 14:44.642
- [James] Yeah, go for it.

14:44.676 --> 14:47.369
- I'll read it out loud for
all the folks back home.

14:47.403 --> 14:48.680
They'll want to know
what's gonna happen.

14:48.715 --> 14:51.821
- Sod them, I want to know.
[laughing]

14:51.856 --> 14:53.409
- Right, task one.

14:53.444 --> 14:55.101
Welcome to Eyes and Prize.

14:55.135 --> 14:56.826
I'm sure you'll all
be wanting to find out

14:56.861 --> 14:58.759
what's going to happen
during your stay here.

14:58.794 --> 14:59.691
- [Abbi] Yes!

14:59.726 --> 15:01.141
- You will find out soon enough,

15:01.176 --> 15:04.869
but first we need to do a
little housekeeping exercise.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.077
- [Abbi] Okay.

15:06.112 --> 15:08.045
- You are going
to open your case

15:08.079 --> 15:10.668
and place it on the
floor in front of you.

15:10.702 --> 15:13.153
Then, another participant
will thoroughly

15:13.188 --> 15:15.845
go through your
suitcase making sure

15:15.880 --> 15:18.710
that nothing prohibited
has been brought in.

15:18.745 --> 15:21.265
Any of the following items

15:21.299 --> 15:24.889
must be put into the
plastic bag supplied.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.063
Which we've got over there.

15:26.097 --> 15:28.962
Mobile phone, mp3
player, tablet device,

15:28.997 --> 15:33.242
computer, any electrical
devices and any watches.

15:33.277 --> 15:34.174
Blimey!

15:34.209 --> 15:35.451
- I don't have any of those.

15:35.486 --> 15:36.694
- [Abbi] Yeah, we
were already told

15:36.728 --> 15:38.316
not to bring them
in the instructions.

15:38.351 --> 15:40.732
- You will also check the
pockets of all the other

15:40.767 --> 15:43.735
participants to make sure
that no prohibited items

15:43.770 --> 15:45.945
have been hidden in there.

15:45.979 --> 15:48.706
Ooh, right, now
then, here we go.

15:48.740 --> 15:51.985
Once you have completed
the first task,

15:52.020 --> 15:54.298
place the key in the plastic bag

15:54.332 --> 15:56.024
and leave it by the front door.

15:57.473 --> 16:00.131
Right, congratulations on
completing your first task,

16:00.166 --> 16:01.995
you will find a
reward in the fridge.

16:02.030 --> 16:04.480
- Oooh!
[Ron laughs]

16:04.515 --> 16:05.895
- Please attach the microphones

16:05.930 --> 16:07.345
to clothing close to your mouth.

16:07.380 --> 16:09.209
Yes, yes, we've
done that already.

16:09.244 --> 16:13.765
These must be worn
at all times, hmm.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.284
Enjoy today.

16:15.319 --> 16:17.079
We will be in contact soon.

16:17.114 --> 16:20.531
And remember, expect
the unexpected.

16:20.565 --> 16:24.017
[Abbi shrieking]

16:24.052 --> 16:25.294
- [Abbi] What's in the fridge?

16:25.329 --> 16:26.123
- That'll be the wine.

16:26.157 --> 16:27.193
- [Abbi] Wine!

16:27.227 --> 16:29.160
That's a great reward.

16:29.195 --> 16:30.748
[Ron mumbling]

16:30.782 --> 16:31.645
Oh yes.

16:31.680 --> 16:32.784
- Nice.

16:32.819 --> 16:34.994
- As if, our first task already.

16:35.028 --> 16:36.581
- [Ron] Wonder what
the next task will be.

16:36.616 --> 16:39.481
- 'Ere, James hasn't
had the grand tour yet.

16:39.515 --> 16:40.792
Look at all the cameras.

16:40.827 --> 16:42.173
- [Ron] Through
there's locked, James.

16:42.208 --> 16:43.105
- Oh that's locked?

16:43.140 --> 16:44.313
- [Abbi] Here's the bathroom.

16:44.348 --> 16:45.970
- [Ron] We reckon that's
the bedroom through there.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.834
- Oh the bedroom--
- Oh my God yeah, the bedroom.

16:47.868 --> 16:48.835
[Ron and Abbi mumbling]

16:48.869 --> 16:50.319
- So how long have you
guys been here for?

16:50.354 --> 16:52.114
- You know what, maybe we
have to do another task

16:52.149 --> 16:53.322
to get through there?

16:53.357 --> 16:54.530
[Ron and Abbi chatting]
- What d'this guy say to you?

16:54.565 --> 16:55.255
- Not much.

16:55.290 --> 16:56.256
Like I said it was really brief.

16:56.291 --> 16:58.120
I didn't know what was
going on to be honest.

16:58.155 --> 16:59.259
- What was he like?

16:59.294 --> 17:00.571
- Sort of normal I guess.

17:00.605 --> 17:02.297
- He had a headset with a--

17:02.331 --> 17:03.194
- A mic?

17:03.229 --> 17:04.436
- Yeah, yeah.

17:04.471 --> 17:06.541
So he went back down and just
told me to keep on going.

17:06.577 --> 17:08.233
- Oh, he didn't say
anything else to you?

17:08.268 --> 17:09.200
- No, nothing else.

17:09.234 --> 17:10.752
Didn't really think much of it.

17:10.788 --> 17:11.685
- Yeah, of course.

17:11.720 --> 17:13.272
- Shall we check each other's?

17:13.308 --> 17:14.377
- Yeah.

17:14.412 --> 17:15.619
- This one is mine here.

17:16.828 --> 17:19.383
- What we supposed to
be looking for again?

17:19.416 --> 17:22.868
- [James] It says on the
sheet, mobile phones,

17:22.903 --> 17:25.527
MP3 players, tablets, computers.

17:25.560 --> 17:26.804
- [Abbi] Okay, [mumbling].

17:28.253 --> 17:29.082
- Swap places, you come.

17:29.117 --> 17:30.877
There we go, I'm in.

17:30.911 --> 17:33.604
- [Abbi] Sorry it's a mess.

17:33.638 --> 17:34.984
- Well what's this fellow?

17:35.019 --> 17:37.849
- Yeah I thought I'd risk it.

17:37.884 --> 17:41.543
[James and Marcus mumbling]

17:44.166 --> 17:45.616
- It was already
a heatwave there.

17:45.650 --> 17:47.825
It was like 115 or something.

17:47.859 --> 17:49.240
- [Abbi] Oh God, that is hot.

17:49.275 --> 17:50.897
That's too hot, that is.

17:50.931 --> 17:52.105
- And we couldn't find a doctor.

17:52.140 --> 17:53.555
And the rep were
nowhere to be seen.

17:53.589 --> 17:55.557
Of course we were in a
villa and not in a hotel,

17:55.591 --> 17:57.076
there was no receptionist
to help us out.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.801
I didn't know what to do.
- Oh no.

17:58.836 --> 18:01.114
- There was nobody in
the villa next to us,

18:01.149 --> 18:02.495
so we couldn't get
any medication.

18:02.529 --> 18:05.394
And she was so bad I
had to stay with her

18:05.429 --> 18:08.052
and I had to keep a cold flannel
on her head all day long.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.916
- [Abbi] Oh no, poor thing.

18:09.950 --> 18:12.539
- And what made it worse
was, I couldn't figure out

18:12.574 --> 18:16.095
how to switch the damned
air conditioning on.

18:16.129 --> 18:18.097
It was this computerized thing.

18:18.131 --> 18:22.411
When I started fiddling with
it, I screwed it right up.

18:22.446 --> 18:23.516
- Oh no!

18:23.550 --> 18:25.380
- It was on to begin with,
then I went and turned

18:25.414 --> 18:26.588
the damn thing off.

18:26.622 --> 18:28.107
- [Abbi] Couldn't you
call your friends?

18:28.141 --> 18:29.660
- Oh yeah, I tried that,
but they couldn't remember

18:29.694 --> 18:33.319
'ow to do it without being
there, in front of it like.

18:33.353 --> 18:34.906
- [Abbi] Are you close
to your wife, Ron?

18:34.941 --> 18:37.150
- Yeah, yeah, of course, yeah.

18:37.185 --> 18:39.635
- [AbbiÃ·}] I dunno how you can
get away with not telling her.

18:39.670 --> 18:42.776
I mean, I know I
didn't tell my mum

18:43.950 --> 18:45.641
but when it's your partner,
it's a bit different, isn't it?

18:45.676 --> 18:48.127
I mean don't get me wrong,
I think you've done amazing

18:48.161 --> 18:51.440
to do that, but I just think
it must have been so hard?

18:51.475 --> 18:52.959
- No, no, it was easy.

18:52.993 --> 18:56.514
I mean it sounds a bit bad,
but she is the gullible sort.

18:56.549 --> 18:58.999
You know, I can say anything
and she'll believe me.

18:59.034 --> 19:01.864
- [Abbi] But, didn't it kill
you to have to lie to her?

19:01.899 --> 19:04.384
- Yeah, I see where
you're going, yeah,

19:04.419 --> 19:07.456
but the way I look at
it, I had to do it,

19:07.491 --> 19:09.320
so I wasn't really
thinking like that.

19:09.355 --> 19:13.531
- [Abbi] Yeah, well, I mean,
I felt awful lying to my mum,

19:13.566 --> 19:17.880
and Sally, and Kate as well,
and everyone, actually.

19:17.915 --> 19:19.261
- Well, it wasn't
easy, but the way

19:19.296 --> 19:20.538
I look at it like is for the

19:20.573 --> 19:22.333
greater good like, you know.

19:23.369 --> 19:24.611
- Oh yeah, I mean...

19:24.646 --> 19:25.785
I totally get that.

19:25.819 --> 19:26.648
I just think...

19:27.580 --> 19:29.202
You've done really well.

19:29.237 --> 19:30.686
It just must of
been tough on you.

19:30.721 --> 19:32.240
- [Ron] Well, yeah, it
wasn't the easiest, no.

19:32.274 --> 19:33.448
- [Marcus] ...medium
sized venues of 200 people

19:33.482 --> 19:35.174
- [Abbi] I'll just
get the garlic bread.

19:35.208 --> 19:36.554
- Yeah, I mean, it
was tough, really.

19:36.589 --> 19:38.660
- [Marcus] ...then, you
don't get actual money.

19:39.523 --> 19:40.731
So then it works out that

19:40.765 --> 19:42.215
guys who were set
up the instruments.

19:42.250 --> 19:44.044
Get paid more than
the fucking band.

19:44.631 --> 19:45.529
- So not fair.

19:45.563 --> 19:46.668
- Is this your band, is it?

19:46.702 --> 19:48.980
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

19:49.015 --> 19:51.259
It's hard to get money
out of people, isn't it?

19:51.293 --> 19:52.467
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

19:52.501 --> 19:54.227
- It's not that. People
are willing to pay.

19:54.262 --> 19:55.573
Just don't go where it should.

19:55.608 --> 19:57.437
To the band.
- Yeah, that's it.

19:57.472 --> 19:59.232
It's the way of the world, yeah.

19:59.267 --> 20:01.510
The fat cats get all the milk.

20:01.545 --> 20:03.685
- Hey, has everybody
got wine, by the way?

20:03.719 --> 20:05.031
- Thank you, yes.
- Yeah.

20:05.065 --> 20:07.792
- [Abbi] Well, cheers, everyone!

20:07.827 --> 20:09.035
- Thank you so much, Abbi.

20:09.069 --> 20:10.795
- [Abbi] Yeah, to our
first meal in the house.

20:10.830 --> 20:12.521
- Yeah!
- To our good health.

20:12.556 --> 20:13.798
- To the show.
- Yeah.

20:13.833 --> 20:16.249
- Yes, to Eyes and Prize
and having a great time.

20:16.284 --> 20:18.147
- Eyes and Prize.
- Yeah, yeah!

20:18.182 --> 20:20.426
- And to finding
out what's going on.

20:20.460 --> 20:22.807
And what the hell we're
supposed to be doing.

20:22.842 --> 20:23.843
[laughing]

20:23.877 --> 20:26.121
That would help.

20:28.365 --> 20:30.470
- Well, there is an easy way.

20:31.644 --> 20:32.472
- Yeah?

20:34.163 --> 20:35.613
- You've still got
the key, right?

20:36.890 --> 20:38.098
The key for the door.

20:38.133 --> 20:40.135
- Oh yeah I was gonna put it
in that bag, like they said.

20:40.169 --> 20:42.102
- We could just unlock the door

20:42.137 --> 20:43.345
find whoever's in charge.

20:44.277 --> 20:45.485
Ask them a few questions.

20:45.520 --> 20:46.486
- Yeah!

20:46.521 --> 20:47.798
Oh my god, shit!

20:48.626 --> 20:49.903
Maybe that's what
we're supposed to do?

20:49.938 --> 20:51.457
- Thinking outside the box.

20:51.491 --> 20:53.459
- I wonder what they'd do
if we just went out there?

20:53.493 --> 20:54.529
- Find out.

20:54.563 --> 20:56.047
- This is nice Abbi, thanks.

20:56.082 --> 20:57.773
- Oh, thank you!
- Yeah, this is real nice.

20:57.808 --> 20:59.292
- I'll have to make my
chili con carne soon.

20:59.327 --> 21:00.535
- Oh, I love a bit of chili.

21:00.569 --> 21:01.846
- Maybe I could do
that tomorrow night?

21:01.881 --> 21:02.985
- Yeah, that'd be great, yeah.

21:03.020 --> 21:04.780
- Not too hot though, I'm
not a fan of spicy food.

21:04.815 --> 21:06.955
- Oh no, it's not that
hot, it's more kind of--

21:06.989 --> 21:09.406
- Tasty.
- Yeah, it's tasty.

21:09.440 --> 21:10.717
- I won't put too much chili in.

21:10.752 --> 21:11.994
- No.

21:12.029 --> 21:13.479
- This is real nice
though Abbi, lovely.

21:13.513 --> 21:15.239
- Hey, do you reckon that's
what we're supposed to do?

21:15.274 --> 21:16.516
To get outside?

21:16.551 --> 21:17.897
- Could be.
- Maybe.

21:17.931 --> 21:19.692
- Maybe that's how
to get to the garden?

21:19.726 --> 21:20.624
- Yeah, yeah.

21:20.658 --> 21:21.797
- Oh my god, I hope
it's still sunny.

21:21.832 --> 21:22.626
- It's supposed to be.

21:22.660 --> 21:23.799
- Really?

21:23.834 --> 21:25.353
Oh, it'd be so nice to have
a glass of wine outside.

21:25.387 --> 21:26.906
- The forecast have
said it's gonna

21:26.940 --> 21:28.010
be even hotter next week.

21:28.045 --> 21:29.840
- Oh, yes!

21:29.874 --> 21:31.531
- [Ron] Yes, they said it's
gonna be Mediterranean.

21:31.566 --> 21:34.603
- Best time of year,
everyone's just in a good mood.

21:34.638 --> 21:37.192
Like less stressed out,
in a brighter mood.

21:37.226 --> 21:38.435
- Vitamin Ds.

21:38.469 --> 21:39.953
- Yeah, it makes such a
difference, doesn't it?

21:39.988 --> 21:41.403
- It does, doesn't it?
- That's why holidays

21:41.438 --> 21:42.577
are so important.

21:42.611 --> 21:43.854
- Yeah.
- So that's when you can

21:43.888 --> 21:47.029
really well relax, just
sit back and just let

21:47.064 --> 21:49.756
the stresses of the
day job just disappear.

21:49.791 --> 21:52.311
- Yeah, so long as you can get
the air conditioning to work.

21:52.345 --> 21:54.761
[laughing]

21:54.796 --> 21:56.867
- Well guys, we're
all on holiday at the
moment, aren't we?

21:56.901 --> 21:58.938
- Yeah, that's true.
- Actually, I think I'd still

21:58.972 --> 22:00.249
be on the plane.

22:00.284 --> 22:01.665
- [Ron] You wouldn't
be nearly there yet.

22:01.699 --> 22:03.114
- Yeah!

22:03.149 --> 22:04.806
God, what time is it?

22:04.840 --> 22:07.671
I don't even think I
would be at Singapore yet.

22:07.705 --> 22:09.086
- I tell you what,
better dinner here though

22:09.120 --> 22:10.501
than what you get on the plane.

22:10.536 --> 22:12.020
- I like dinner on the planes.

22:12.054 --> 22:13.746
- Yeah, [mumbles.
- Yeah!

22:13.780 --> 22:14.919
[mumbles]

22:14.954 --> 22:17.128
- [Marcus] Nothing
beats a nice air hostess

22:17.163 --> 22:19.061
serving you a nice cold beer.

22:19.096 --> 22:20.787
- [Abbi] Oh my god, that's
what I was gonna say.

22:20.822 --> 22:22.548
- [Marcus] Thank
you very, very much.

22:22.582 --> 22:24.273
- A nice G&T on ale.
- Oh, that's good.

22:24.308 --> 22:25.689
- [Abbi] Celebrate
going on holiday.

22:25.723 --> 22:27.622
- Nice bit of luxury that, yeah.

22:27.656 --> 22:29.348
- Yeah.
- Drinks on the plane.

22:31.971 --> 22:32.799
- This is lovely.

22:36.734 --> 22:40.738
- [Marcus] I'm off to Thailand,
you're off to Australia,

22:40.773 --> 22:43.534
you're off to Mexico,
and you, you're off

22:43.569 --> 22:45.364
to the north of Scotland.

22:45.398 --> 22:46.572
[laughing]

22:46.606 --> 22:47.883
- What's wrong with
that, what, what?

22:47.918 --> 22:49.402
- [Marcus] You got the
shit deal there, mate.

22:49.437 --> 22:51.818
- Hey, I am supposed to
be going to Spain as well.

22:51.853 --> 22:55.753
[all talking over one another]

22:56.996 --> 22:59.101
- [Abbi] So what did
you tell your band?

23:01.483 --> 23:04.383
- Same as I told
everyone, really.

23:04.417 --> 23:06.177
- [Abbi] How is that?

23:06.212 --> 23:10.078
- Fine, I was just sort of like
you, just sorting things out

23:10.112 --> 23:11.459
with Spike.
- Oh yeah, with Spike.

23:11.493 --> 23:13.944
- [Abbi] Oh my god,
he was so great.

23:13.978 --> 23:16.843
He literally saved
me so many times.

23:16.878 --> 23:18.707
I hope we get to
meet him actually.

23:18.742 --> 23:20.191
- [Ron] Yeah,
yeah, me too, yeah.

23:20.226 --> 23:22.642
- [Abbi] Oh my god, the worst,
that was my leaving party.

23:22.677 --> 23:23.988
- [Ron] You had a leaving party?

23:24.023 --> 23:25.680
- [Abbi] Oh my
god, it was awful.

23:25.714 --> 23:27.958
They threw a surprise
thing for me.

23:27.992 --> 23:29.442
- You're joking.
- And they were asking

23:29.477 --> 23:32.307
me so many questions about
Australia, and I just didn't

23:32.341 --> 23:34.689
know the answer so I kept
having to run to the toilet

23:34.723 --> 23:38.624
to email Spike and he was so
great, told me what to do,

23:38.658 --> 23:41.109
what to say.
- Good old Spike, yeah.

23:41.143 --> 23:42.835
- [Abbi] Oh my god,
can you believe?

23:42.869 --> 23:45.113
They got me one of
those hats with the--

23:45.147 --> 23:46.563
- [Ron] Australian
hats, with the cork?

23:46.597 --> 23:49.669
- [Abbi] Yeah, yeah, no,
they did, with the cork!

23:49.704 --> 23:51.188
I was like oh thanks, great.

23:51.222 --> 23:52.879
- [Ron] You know the
corks are supposed

23:54.053 --> 23:55.710
to keep the flies out.
- Oh, is that it?

23:55.744 --> 23:57.401
I was just like could've
given me money, or something.

23:57.436 --> 23:58.195
Bloody hell.

23:58.229 --> 23:59.714
- [Marucs] Hey!

23:59.748 --> 24:01.854
- I'm sorry, I'll
see you tomorrow.

24:09.931 --> 24:11.622
- [Marcus] What the
fuck just happened?

24:14.901 --> 24:17.421
âª Here we go, here we go

24:17.456 --> 24:19.181
[laughing]

24:19.216 --> 24:21.390
[panting]
Fuck.

24:23.254 --> 24:25.153
[knocking]

24:25.187 --> 24:26.223
- [Marcus] James, mate.

24:28.570 --> 24:29.433
James.

24:30.848 --> 24:33.195
Where the fuck's he gone?

24:35.715 --> 24:37.199
[knocking]

24:37.234 --> 24:38.925
Where the fuck is he?

24:38.960 --> 24:40.582
I'm so confused right now.

24:41.790 --> 24:45.449
He just upped and left,
in the middle of dinner.

24:52.421 --> 24:54.769
- [Marcus] James, mate.

24:54.803 --> 24:57.496
[knocking]

24:57.530 --> 25:00.050
He's ignoring me as well?

25:00.084 --> 25:01.465
[knocking]

25:01.500 --> 25:03.122
- [Abbi] Hello?

25:03.156 --> 25:03.985
James?

25:05.745 --> 25:06.643
Can we come in?

25:06.677 --> 25:08.196
- [James] Yes mate, come on.

25:08.230 --> 25:09.887
[giggling]

25:09.922 --> 25:10.992
[knocking]

25:11.026 --> 25:12.269
- [Abbi] Are you
gonna let us in?

25:12.303 --> 25:13.857
- [Ron] I don't think
he's gonna let you in.

25:13.891 --> 25:15.065
- [Marcus] Your
wine's out 'ere, mate.

25:15.099 --> 25:16.860
- [Abbi] Yeah, you haven't
even finished your dinner.

25:16.894 --> 25:17.930
- [Marcus] Ron's
gonna eat it all.

25:17.964 --> 25:18.931
- [Abbi] Yeah!

25:18.965 --> 25:20.139
- We've got ice cream.
- Yeah, we're all gonna

25:20.173 --> 25:21.830
have ice cream for desert.

25:23.107 --> 25:24.971
[knocking]

25:25.006 --> 25:26.663
[mumbles]

25:26.697 --> 25:29.079
- [Marcus] Come on,
mate, [mumbles].

25:29.113 --> 25:32.531
[voices muffled by door]

25:36.949 --> 25:39.296
[knocking]
[mumbles]

25:39.330 --> 25:40.953
- [Abbi] Hello?

25:40.987 --> 25:42.782
Jamesy?

25:44.439 --> 25:45.682
- [Marcus] Hey!

25:50.341 --> 25:52.585
- [Abbi] Who else is in there?

25:54.483 --> 25:56.624
Is that the bedroom
in there, James?

25:58.039 --> 26:00.248
[knocking]

26:04.390 --> 26:07.807
[voices muffled by door]

26:15.815 --> 26:16.885
James!

26:19.163 --> 26:21.096
We wanna be part of the fun!

26:23.409 --> 26:26.826
[voices muffled by door]

26:27.758 --> 26:30.450
[typing clicks]

26:30.485 --> 26:33.868
[voices muffled by door]

26:44.050 --> 26:46.259
[voices muffled by door]

26:46.294 --> 26:48.745
[knocking]

26:48.779 --> 26:50.574
[Abbi] How do we
get out of here?

26:53.232 --> 26:54.060
James!

26:59.479 --> 27:03.345
[voices muffled by door]

27:03.380 --> 27:04.657
[knocking]

27:04.692 --> 27:05.554
James!

27:11.906 --> 27:15.323
[voices muffled by door]

27:46.388 --> 27:48.563
[knocking]

27:48.597 --> 27:51.739
[Abbi] Is there a magic
word we need to say?

27:51.773 --> 27:53.775
Please?

28:44.446 --> 28:45.965
[knocking]

28:46.000 --> 28:48.761
- [Marcus] Come on
mate, let us in.

28:48.796 --> 28:50.073
Don't ignore me

28:50.107 --> 28:53.697
[knocking out "Shave
and a Haircut"]

28:56.769 --> 29:00.117
[voices muffled by door]

29:04.950 --> 29:07.228
[rustling]

29:08.885 --> 29:12.302
He said he's seen
someone, right?

29:39.674 --> 29:41.158
- Got some sort of reward?

29:41.193 --> 29:42.781
- Like the bedroom.

29:42.815 --> 29:44.368
- Yes, he's got the bedroom!

29:44.403 --> 29:46.060
Fuck!

29:46.094 --> 29:48.717
Maybe that's what we've
gotta do, like some sort

29:48.752 --> 29:50.823
of secret mission and you get

29:50.858 --> 29:53.205
rewards for doing
secret missions.

29:53.239 --> 29:54.378
- Yeah, you never know.

29:54.413 --> 29:56.760
- Jesus. Hey maybe
someone else'll come in?

29:56.795 --> 29:58.555
- Yeah, who knows?

29:58.589 --> 30:01.040
Right game this is, eh?

30:01.075 --> 30:02.214
We're in a right game here, hey.

30:02.248 --> 30:03.732
- God...

30:03.767 --> 30:06.080
He said he'll be back in
here tomorrow so I suppose

30:06.114 --> 30:07.667
we're gonna just find out then.

30:07.702 --> 30:08.530
- Yeah.

30:11.879 --> 30:14.882
- I don't get why he was
given a key, for that door.

30:14.916 --> 30:18.057
Like, couldn't someone from the
show have locked us in here?

30:18.092 --> 30:19.472
- Well, I think it
was a secret mission.

30:19.507 --> 30:20.542
- No, the front door.

30:21.716 --> 30:23.856
How come someone gave
him a key to lock that?

30:23.891 --> 30:26.031
Couldn't someone have locked
us in from the outside, you

30:26.065 --> 30:28.205
know, once we're all in here.

30:28.240 --> 30:31.830
- Maybe they gave him two
keys and they said to him

30:31.864 --> 30:33.832
he's gotta leave
at some point today

30:33.866 --> 30:36.144
and he's gotta take
both keys with him

30:36.179 --> 30:39.423
and he's gotta keep it a secret
cause it's a secret mission.

30:39.458 --> 30:40.735
- Yeah, yeah!

30:40.769 --> 30:42.979
- Yeah, maybe, but I dunno.

30:43.013 --> 30:44.532
It just don't sound right to me.

30:44.566 --> 30:46.879
Would someone really
pull him to one side

30:46.914 --> 30:49.848
and say all that to him just
before he comes in here?

30:49.882 --> 30:50.814
- Yeah. I guess so.

30:50.849 --> 30:51.711
- Yeah, yeah.

30:52.920 --> 30:55.923
- Well, what if there
weren't anyone outside?

30:57.890 --> 31:00.237
I mean, we don't know.

31:00.272 --> 31:02.895
What if he's not
actually a contestant?

31:02.930 --> 31:04.172
- What, James?

31:04.207 --> 31:05.656
- Yeah.

31:05.691 --> 31:07.486
What if 'he's like, not
real, like not a contestant.

31:07.520 --> 31:09.695
And he's been sent in to
fuck things up for us?

31:09.729 --> 31:10.903
- But, why would he do that?

31:10.938 --> 31:12.974
- I dunno, maybe he's
been sent in by the show

31:13.009 --> 31:14.217
to mess with our heads.

31:14.251 --> 31:15.390
- Maybe.
- Maybe that's what this

31:15.425 --> 31:16.357
was all about.

31:16.391 --> 31:17.358
- It's a good point, that.

31:17.392 --> 31:18.359
- No, it could be, no?

31:18.393 --> 31:19.705
- Yeah, yeah, I think
you've got it there.

31:19.739 --> 31:20.809
- We just don't know, do we?

31:20.844 --> 31:21.880
- So where's he gone then?

31:22.811 --> 31:24.330
- I don't know, backstage?

31:24.365 --> 31:25.814
- So that's not a bedroom then.

31:25.849 --> 31:27.989
- I don't know, maybe not,
it didn't look like it to me.

31:28.024 --> 31:29.404
- So where's the bedroom then?

31:29.439 --> 31:31.786
- I don't know, it
could be downstairs.

31:31.820 --> 31:32.925
- Through the other door?
- Yeah.

31:32.960 --> 31:34.858
And we can't go check now
can we, 'cause he's got

31:34.893 --> 31:35.755
the fucking key with him?

31:35.790 --> 31:36.895
- Yeah.
- And the bag.

31:36.929 --> 31:37.757
- Yeah.

31:42.348 --> 31:44.868
- So now we're
fucking stuck in here.

31:47.491 --> 31:50.115
- Maybe we just need to
do some sort of secret

31:50.149 --> 31:51.461
mission or something.

31:51.495 --> 31:54.533
- Yeah, yeah, could be.

31:54.567 --> 31:55.430
Could be anything.

31:56.707 --> 31:58.330
What's gonna happen next, ey?

31:59.227 --> 32:00.711
- Yeah, god.

32:00.746 --> 32:02.955
Well, he said he'd be back
in here tomorrow, right?

32:02.990 --> 32:04.957
So we'll wait and see
what happens then.

32:06.786 --> 32:08.961
- That's if he weren't
lying about that.

32:08.996 --> 32:10.583
- But that's what he said.

32:10.618 --> 32:13.897
- Yeah, but that's if he
was an actual contestant.

32:13.932 --> 32:14.967
[laughing]

32:15.002 --> 32:16.210
- But why wouldn't he be?

32:16.244 --> 32:18.626
- Like I'm saying,
we don't know, okay?

32:18.660 --> 32:20.041
He could be an actor, right?

32:20.076 --> 32:21.629
Sent in to fuck things up.

32:21.663 --> 32:23.458
- Yeah, I think you've
got it there now.

32:23.493 --> 32:25.978
[mumbles] think about it,
yeah, expect the unexpected.

32:26.013 --> 32:29.878
- So you're saying it's
just us three then.

32:29.913 --> 32:31.950
- I don't know, maybe, yeah.

32:31.984 --> 32:33.744
And he could be an actor
and he's been sent in

32:33.779 --> 32:35.470
to fucking manipulate us.

32:35.505 --> 32:37.265
- Yeah, yeah, I think
you've got it here,

32:37.300 --> 32:38.439
I think you've got it.

32:40.544 --> 32:42.236
- I don't know, I don't
know what to think.

32:42.270 --> 32:44.065
- They ain't got me.

32:44.100 --> 32:45.377
- We just don't
know, do we, Abbi?

32:45.411 --> 32:47.310
- They ain't got me, pally.

32:47.344 --> 32:50.037
- So then how do I know that
you're not an actor then?

32:50.071 --> 32:51.590
- That's what I'm saying,
we don't know, okay?

32:51.624 --> 32:54.075
Because he's been sent in
to fuck with our heads,

32:54.110 --> 32:56.836
to fuck with us, make
us all doubt each other

32:56.871 --> 32:58.666
and not fucking
trust each other.

32:58.700 --> 33:00.909
- Trust me, I am not an actor,
Abbi, you can believe me.

33:00.944 --> 33:03.291
- I do, I do think it's you.
- Abbi, Abbi, Abbi,

33:03.326 --> 33:04.327
Neither am I, okay?

33:04.361 --> 33:06.501
The thing is, it could be that.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.440
- It's just weird, I don't know.

33:14.475 --> 33:16.822
Let's just wait until tomorrow,
see what happens then.

33:16.856 --> 33:17.685
- Yeah.

33:22.966 --> 33:25.141
Maybe something
else could happen.

33:25.175 --> 33:27.039
[laughing]

33:27.074 --> 33:28.247
Like oh, dear!

33:29.421 --> 33:30.870
- He didn't say
much though, did he?

33:30.905 --> 33:33.045
- I noticed that.
- Not really?

33:33.080 --> 33:35.220
- Watch the quiet ones, hey.
- Yeah?

33:35.254 --> 33:38.085
- I bet this bit'll be going
out on the highlights bit.

33:38.119 --> 33:40.052
- Oh god, yeah!

33:40.087 --> 33:41.433
- If they do highlights.

33:41.467 --> 33:44.125
- Oh, I'm sure
they will do, yeah.

33:44.160 --> 33:47.059
- Ooh, guess he won't be
coming back for this then.

33:47.094 --> 33:49.268
Cheers very much.

33:49.303 --> 33:50.097
[laughing]

33:50.131 --> 33:51.339
Waste not, want not.

33:51.374 --> 33:53.307
- Oh, he's taken my
fucking clippers.

33:53.341 --> 33:54.929
- What, how you gonna
do your hair now?

33:57.345 --> 33:59.347
- That's all right.

33:59.382 --> 34:01.970
- Did he say
anything else to you?

34:02.005 --> 34:04.318
- Yeah, you were
talking to him a lot.

34:04.352 --> 34:06.492
- I don't think he said much.
- Lot more than us, anyway.

34:06.527 --> 34:10.324
- He didn't really say anything
apart from about Mexico.

34:10.358 --> 34:11.187
- Yeah.

34:12.395 --> 34:13.879
Should have known there
was something up with him

34:13.913 --> 34:15.467
when he mentioned that.

34:15.501 --> 34:18.539
I mean, who goes to Mexico?

34:25.373 --> 34:26.340
- I dunno.

34:26.960 --> 34:30.137
[mumbles]

34:30.170 --> 34:32.070
- Oh, nice.
[mumbles]

34:34.313 --> 34:37.109
- Don't look round now,
Ron's getting naked.

34:39.353 --> 34:40.699
- Ron!
- What?

34:41.562 --> 34:43.045
I've got to take my shirt off.

34:44.530 --> 34:45.773
I'm not sleeping in me shirt.

34:45.806 --> 34:49.293
- I'm joking, you've
got a nice body.

34:49.328 --> 34:50.398
- [Ron] Come off it.

34:50.433 --> 34:52.538
- Very manly, I like it.

34:52.572 --> 34:53.677
- [Ron] Give over.

34:53.712 --> 34:55.989
[laughing]

35:02.065 --> 35:02.893
- So mean.

35:10.556 --> 35:12.558
You sleeping on the
sofa tonight then.

35:12.593 --> 35:13.663
- Yeah, I reckon so.

35:15.665 --> 35:18.599
I might get the cushions,
put 'em on the floor though.

35:18.633 --> 35:21.153
I never liked sleeping on sofas.

35:21.188 --> 35:23.051
- You don't like
sleeping on sofas?

35:23.086 --> 35:25.330
- Mm-mm, I get like a
funny taste in my mouth.

35:25.364 --> 35:26.158
- What?

35:26.193 --> 35:27.090
Oh, it's the best.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.264
- What, better than
sleeping on a bed?

35:28.298 --> 35:30.197
- Yeah, loads.

35:30.231 --> 35:33.890
I reckon I've slept on
more sofas than beds.

35:33.924 --> 35:37.480
- No you haven't, no one has
slept on more sofas than beds.

35:37.514 --> 35:38.722
- Honestly, honestly.

35:38.757 --> 35:39.896
- Except for a
tramp or something.

35:39.930 --> 35:41.173
- Honestly, I reckon I have?

35:41.208 --> 35:44.211
I have lived on three houses.
- Oh right yeah.

35:44.832 --> 35:45.867
- Since I was a kid, right?

35:45.902 --> 35:47.110
That's three beds.

35:47.145 --> 35:50.493
Last month, four
sofas, all right?

35:50.527 --> 35:52.184
James's sofa.

35:52.219 --> 35:53.392
- What about holidays?

35:53.427 --> 35:55.153
- Pete's sofa, my mum's sofa.
- What about when you're

35:55.187 --> 35:58.811
touring with your band, what,
do you sleep on sofas then?

35:58.846 --> 36:01.573
- No, we get put up in
hotels, but you ignore that--

36:01.607 --> 36:03.057
- You can't ignore that!
- Then you got

36:03.091 --> 36:04.610
Jack's in Bristol.

36:04.645 --> 36:05.473
- No!

36:06.957 --> 36:08.787
- No, you're right,
I've slept in more beds.

36:08.821 --> 36:09.650
- See?

36:10.789 --> 36:11.997
- But I prefer sofas.

36:12.825 --> 36:13.999
- Lucky you.

36:14.033 --> 36:17.140
- Yeah, I actually might
sell my bed at home

36:18.762 --> 36:21.040
and replace it with a
sofa, just constantly live

36:21.075 --> 36:22.525
the sofa dream.

36:22.559 --> 36:23.491
[laughing]

36:23.526 --> 36:24.354
I might!

36:27.599 --> 36:30.118
- Oh my god, I need more wine.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.262
Can we have some
more wine please?

36:35.296 --> 36:36.228
- Or beer?

36:36.263 --> 36:37.643
- Yeah, or beer.
- I love beer.

36:37.678 --> 36:39.990
- I don't care, actually,
anything will do.

36:41.613 --> 36:42.959
- Please?

36:42.993 --> 36:44.029
We're not fussy.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.242
- Take that as a yes?

36:51.795 --> 36:54.626
- Yeah, someone's just gonna
magically appear at the door

36:54.660 --> 36:58.699
with a can of beer and
a nice bottle of wine.

36:58.733 --> 37:00.148
- How nice.

37:00.183 --> 37:02.012
- Oh, it sounds great.
- Delivery.

37:02.047 --> 37:04.291
[laughing]

37:06.051 --> 37:07.328
What time is it?

37:08.502 --> 37:12.851
- No idea, no watch,
no fucking phone.

37:12.885 --> 37:14.128
- No clocks?

37:15.612 --> 37:16.510
- I don't think...

37:17.752 --> 37:19.582
- [Ron] Take a look at the
cooker, I think that's got a--

37:19.616 --> 37:21.549
- Yes, cooker.

37:22.481 --> 37:23.310
Yes!

37:24.069 --> 37:25.519
- What time is it?

37:26.692 --> 37:28.349
- [Abbi] Okay, 17
minutes past three.

37:28.384 --> 37:29.868
- That's definitely not right

37:29.902 --> 37:31.732
- [Ron] It must be stuck,
I think it must be stopped.

37:31.766 --> 37:33.251
- Yeah.

37:33.285 --> 37:35.425
I reckon it's
about 11, maybe 12?

37:35.460 --> 37:37.841
- [Abbi] I don't
like not knowing.

37:37.876 --> 37:40.568
How we gonna know when to
get up tomorrow morning?

37:40.603 --> 37:41.880
- I--
- We'll know.

37:44.779 --> 37:47.575
- [Abbi] I'm gonna see if
it'll let me get in there.

37:47.610 --> 37:48.921
- [Marcus] They're
not gonna let you in.

37:48.956 --> 37:50.302
[banging]

37:50.337 --> 37:51.407
- Hey!

37:51.441 --> 37:53.547
You can open up now.

37:55.928 --> 37:57.620
We're all gonna
get ready for bed.

38:00.933 --> 38:02.866
Kind of like to sleep
in a bed tonight.

38:04.040 --> 38:04.972
Not on a sofa.

38:06.905 --> 38:07.940
[banging]

38:07.975 --> 38:08.769
Hello?

38:09.977 --> 38:12.117
- Let us in, you fuckers!

38:12.151 --> 38:13.221
- Yeah!
[banging]

38:13.256 --> 38:14.982
- Guys, guys.
- Wake up!

38:15.016 --> 38:16.673
- Yeah!
- Let us in.

38:16.708 --> 38:18.813
- [Ron] Abbi, Marcus, guys,
guys, guys, I don't think

38:18.848 --> 38:22.334
we're supposed to be going
through there tonight.

38:22.369 --> 38:23.853
- Don't say, Ron.

38:23.887 --> 38:25.958
- [Ron] I mean, they
didn't leave them blankets

38:25.993 --> 38:28.478
in the sideboard there
for nothing, did they?

38:28.513 --> 38:31.412
[laughing]

38:31.447 --> 38:32.931
- They're not listening to us.

38:32.965 --> 38:34.415
- They are, right?

38:34.450 --> 38:37.245
And they're laughing
their fucking tits off.

38:37.280 --> 38:39.420
[banging]

38:40.801 --> 38:42.803
- There's definitely
none of them cans left?

38:42.837 --> 38:44.218
- No.

38:44.252 --> 38:45.253
- Did you check
behind the cupboard?

38:45.288 --> 38:46.116
- Yeah.

38:48.878 --> 38:49.706
Yeah.

38:50.535 --> 38:52.813
[laughing]

39:09.312 --> 39:11.452
[humming]

39:18.666 --> 39:20.323
- Morning.
- Oh, hiya!

39:20.358 --> 39:21.289
Good morning!

39:23.015 --> 39:24.534
Hey, I didn't wake you, did I?

39:24.569 --> 39:26.467
- No, I don't think so.

39:27.572 --> 39:28.469
Making breakfast?

39:28.504 --> 39:29.712
- Yeah, do you want some?

39:29.746 --> 39:33.025
- What are you doing?
- Boiled eggs and toast.

39:33.060 --> 39:36.028
- Nah, I'll do my
own, thank you though.

39:36.063 --> 39:37.616
- What, you don't like eggs?

39:37.651 --> 39:39.722
- It's a bit much for breakfast.

39:39.756 --> 39:41.689
- God, are they great.

39:42.863 --> 39:44.796
Great way to start the day.

39:47.212 --> 39:48.040
You sleep okay?

39:50.008 --> 39:51.803
- Yeah, okay, I think.

39:51.837 --> 39:55.565
- Hey, when I go out of bed,
all these lights got bright.

39:56.497 --> 39:57.843
Amazing.

39:57.878 --> 40:00.087
- Really?
- Yeah, it was amazing.

40:00.121 --> 40:02.434
As I woke up, it
was completely dark.

40:02.469 --> 40:05.851
And then as I got out of
bed, it slowly got light.

40:08.544 --> 40:10.615
- They were still on
when I fell asleep.

40:10.649 --> 40:12.444
- Must be some sort
of dimmer light.

40:17.276 --> 40:18.450
- Is it comfortable
enough down there?

40:18.485 --> 40:20.314
- Oh yeah, went great,
slept like a log.

40:20.348 --> 40:21.384
- Really?
- Yeah, it was like

40:21.419 --> 40:23.006
proper camping, that was.

40:23.041 --> 40:25.319
[laughing]

40:27.597 --> 40:29.047
[humming]

40:29.081 --> 40:30.738
- Wonder what
today's got in store.

40:30.773 --> 40:32.878
- Yeah, looking forward
to it, to finding out,

40:32.913 --> 40:34.949
could be anything, ey?

40:34.984 --> 40:36.986
- I reckon we'll
be through there.

40:37.020 --> 40:39.091
- Yeah?
- Yeah, or downstairs.

40:39.126 --> 40:40.368
- Yeah, yeah.

40:43.199 --> 40:45.373
- Wonder why they kept
us in here last night?

40:45.408 --> 40:49.308
- Yeah, all part of their
little game I guess.

40:49.343 --> 40:52.829
- Yeah, is there any milk?

40:52.864 --> 40:54.452
- Yeah, tons.

40:54.486 --> 40:55.660
- Oh, yes!

40:55.694 --> 40:57.282
- And there's some cereal
in here, some corn flakes.

40:57.316 --> 40:58.766
- Ah yes, I want
a bowl of cereal.

40:58.801 --> 41:00.527
Ooh, what's that smell?

41:00.561 --> 41:01.597
- Oh, damn!

41:01.631 --> 41:03.046
- Oh, oh no, Ron!

41:04.772 --> 41:06.153
- Oh, I had to push it in again

41:06.187 --> 41:09.087
'cause it weren't done enough.

41:09.121 --> 41:10.675
- I hate when that happens.

41:10.709 --> 41:12.746
- No bother, plenty more bread.

41:12.780 --> 41:13.609
- Yeah.

41:15.473 --> 41:19.546
One thing I do know about
toasters is you know that dial?

41:19.580 --> 41:22.583
That actually controls the
length of time that it toasts.

41:22.618 --> 41:24.240
- Yeah?
- Not the temperature.

41:24.274 --> 41:26.587
So when you turn it up
full blast 'cause you want

41:26.622 --> 41:29.694
it to go quicker, it just
puts it in for longer,

41:29.728 --> 41:31.523
doesn't make it
any hotter inside?

41:31.558 --> 41:34.077
- Yeah, no, I just
forgot, that's all.

41:34.112 --> 41:36.217
- Aww, yeah, no, I've
done that before.

41:36.252 --> 41:37.322
- Yeah, yeah.

41:39.635 --> 41:41.809
[humming]

41:43.846 --> 41:45.295
Do you know if there's
any orange juice?

41:45.330 --> 41:48.747
- Not sure, fridge, wouldn't it?

41:48.782 --> 41:51.888
I don't know see any, no,
no, I don't think so, no.

41:54.615 --> 41:56.099
- Maybe in the cupboard?

41:56.134 --> 41:58.826
- Well, if not, you can just
ask for some, can't you?

42:00.034 --> 42:01.070
- Yeah, suppose so.

42:02.278 --> 42:04.073
- Hey, we should make up a
list of things that we want.

42:04.107 --> 42:06.489
- Mm, good idea, yeah!

42:08.560 --> 42:13.531
- Right, here we go, waiting
for your little soldiers.

42:15.222 --> 42:16.741
- Do you reckon it's
safe to have a shower?

42:16.775 --> 42:18.397
- Yeah, I reckon so, yeah.

42:20.917 --> 42:23.264
- I might wear my
bikini just in case.

42:23.299 --> 42:24.783
- Yeah, good plan, good idea.

42:29.132 --> 42:32.308
- Aw, done, how long's
it take to do eggs?

42:32.342 --> 42:34.344
- Boiled eggs, four minutes.

42:34.379 --> 42:36.208
- Four minutes?
- Yeah.

42:36.243 --> 42:38.072
- [Abbi] Well, how do you
know when they're done then?

42:38.107 --> 42:40.903
- [Ron] Oh, you just know, got
like an internal body clock.

42:40.937 --> 42:42.939
Everybody does.
- Hm!

42:42.974 --> 42:45.908
[light clattering]

42:48.807 --> 42:50.360
- Oi-Oi, Savaloys.

42:50.395 --> 42:51.638
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Marcus.

42:51.672 --> 42:52.984
Nice of you to join us.

42:54.088 --> 42:55.642
- What's going on then?

42:55.676 --> 42:58.265
[cup rattling]

43:33.749 --> 43:36.648
Oh, yeah.

43:36.683 --> 43:39.478
[sighing]

43:39.513 --> 43:41.411
- You gonna have another sleep?

43:41.446 --> 43:42.274
- [Marcus] Nah.

43:45.139 --> 43:47.832
- Hey, do you wanna
help us look for clues?

43:49.523 --> 43:50.351
- [Marcus] Nah.

43:55.667 --> 43:57.980
- So why don't you tell us
a bit more about your band?

44:00.948 --> 44:02.260
- [Marcus] Not much
to say, really.

44:04.158 --> 44:05.781
- What sort of music is it then?

44:08.266 --> 44:10.958
- [Marcus] I don't know,
sort of rock music, I guess.

44:10.993 --> 44:13.685
- Oh, wow, I love a
bit of rock music, me.

44:14.721 --> 44:16.723
I like a bit of Queen, I do.

44:16.757 --> 44:18.517
- [Marcus] Yeah,
it's not like that.

44:21.141 --> 44:24.800
- Brian May, he's
something else.

44:26.664 --> 44:29.528
One of a kind, he
is, he's a visionary.

44:33.015 --> 44:33.843
Hm.

44:35.258 --> 44:37.640
So when did you start
picking up the guitar, then?

44:40.263 --> 44:41.471
- [Marcus] When I was at school.

44:41.506 --> 44:43.611
- Oh yeah, that's the
time, when you're young.

44:44.854 --> 44:47.512
I'd love to play guitar,
me, but I'm too old.

44:47.546 --> 44:50.101
It gets tougher to
pick some stuff up,

44:50.135 --> 44:51.619
the older you get like.

44:52.759 --> 44:54.070
There's no doubt about that.

44:58.281 --> 45:01.457
You must be well glad that
you got on here then, yeah?

45:03.770 --> 45:07.152
I mean, this is really gonna
boost your profile, hey,

45:07.187 --> 45:10.155
I bet that record label'll
be crawling back to you.

45:10.190 --> 45:12.123
- [Marcus] Yeah, it
don't work like that.

45:12.157 --> 45:13.400
- I bet they do, though.

45:13.434 --> 45:15.471
- [Marcus] Yeah, well
that's not why I'm here,

45:15.505 --> 45:19.475
I'm just here for the
experience, for the craic.

45:19.509 --> 45:20.994
- Oh yeah, so are we all.

45:21.028 --> 45:22.202
- Shh!

45:22.236 --> 45:25.136
Can hear something
again, someone moving.

45:26.102 --> 45:26.965
- Again?

45:29.416 --> 45:30.935
- And a ding, it sounds
like a microwave!

45:30.969 --> 45:31.798
- [Ron] Yeah?

45:34.076 --> 45:35.767
- [Marcus] Yeah, I can
smell something cooking.

45:35.802 --> 45:37.113
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

45:38.425 --> 45:39.426
- [Marcus] Is that tomato soup?

45:39.460 --> 45:40.979
- It is, as well!

45:41.014 --> 45:44.396
Hey, we've got tomato
soup in here as well.

45:44.431 --> 45:45.777
- They must have a
kitchen in there then.

45:45.812 --> 45:47.434
- [Ron] Do you wanna
come and join us?

45:49.160 --> 45:51.265
- Are you coming back in?

45:53.647 --> 45:55.166
He must still be in there then.

45:56.823 --> 45:58.548
- It's probably a camera man.
- Who is it?

45:58.583 --> 45:59.895
We can hear you.

46:07.109 --> 46:08.524
- I don't think
it's gonna be open.

46:08.558 --> 46:09.974
- Yeah, any luck?

46:11.492 --> 46:13.046
- Nah, nothing yet.

46:13.080 --> 46:15.358
- Yeah, me neither, still.

46:15.393 --> 46:16.739
Plenty more to go on.

46:16.774 --> 46:18.258
- Yeah.

46:18.292 --> 46:20.570
I'm gonna go through
the kitchen next,

46:20.605 --> 46:21.813
have a look through
all the cupboards.

46:21.848 --> 46:24.885
- Yeah, yeah, good idea, that.

46:24.920 --> 46:26.680
- [Marcus] You're not
gonna find anything.

46:26.714 --> 46:31.029
- Well, we need to give it
a try, Marcus, you know.

46:32.790 --> 46:35.827
We're searching for any words
that might be underlined.

46:35.862 --> 46:37.242
- [Marcus] I think
it's a waste of time.

46:37.277 --> 46:38.243
- Well, I don't know.

46:39.727 --> 46:41.937
- No!
- Oh, you fucker!

46:41.971 --> 46:44.180
Oh my god!
- How did I miss?

46:44.215 --> 46:45.733
- Where did it even go?

46:45.768 --> 46:48.288
Where did it go?
- Oh my god.

46:48.322 --> 46:49.876
Down there.
- Got it, got it?

46:49.910 --> 46:51.015
- Down there.
- No!

46:52.879 --> 46:55.226
That's so poor, thank you!

46:55.260 --> 46:57.055
- Fuck!
- Okay!

46:57.090 --> 47:00.576
- Oh, Abbi goes for gold!
- One, two!

47:00.610 --> 47:02.164
- Oh, every time!
- Come on, sir!

47:02.198 --> 47:03.855
- What?
- Rubbish.

47:03.890 --> 47:04.925
- Come on, [mumbles],
come on, [mumbles].

47:04.960 --> 47:07.238
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Oh my god!

47:07.272 --> 47:09.447
- I got it, I got it
this time, this time!

47:09.481 --> 47:10.586
[cheering]

47:10.620 --> 47:15.315
Shit!
- One, two, three, four, five!

47:16.868 --> 47:18.145
- He missed!
- I missed, I missed.

47:18.180 --> 47:19.595
- He missed!
- I missed.

47:19.629 --> 47:21.666
- [Abbi] Why is
no one getting it?

47:21.700 --> 47:22.840
Okay.
- Here we go.

47:22.874 --> 47:23.771
- [Abbi] On the chair, ready.

47:23.806 --> 47:25.118
- On the chair.
- For the big shot.

47:25.152 --> 47:25.808
- [Ron] Big shot.

47:26.913 --> 47:28.017
[cheering]

47:28.052 --> 47:29.777
- Yes, yes, yes!
- Get down, get down,

47:29.812 --> 47:31.262
get down, get down!
- Wow!

47:31.296 --> 47:35.300
Three, two, one!

47:35.922 --> 47:37.647
[laughing]

47:37.682 --> 47:39.373
[all talking over one another]

47:39.408 --> 47:41.513
- Forfeit time.
- No, no, no.

47:41.548 --> 47:42.894
Not gonna play this silly game.

47:42.929 --> 47:44.171
- Pick a cup, Ron.

47:44.206 --> 47:45.724
- Oh, come on.
- Ron, you've got to.

47:45.759 --> 47:46.898
- Yeah!
- You lost.

47:46.933 --> 47:48.106
- Well, you must
think I'm right stupid

47:48.141 --> 47:49.487
if I'm gonna play this.
- You have to.

47:49.521 --> 47:50.695
- Ron.
- Now, now, now.

47:50.729 --> 47:52.662
- You paid the ticket, you
take the ride, pick up the cup.

47:52.697 --> 47:53.871
Abbi did hers.
- Yeah!

47:53.905 --> 47:55.389
- Let's just--
- You might not even get it.

47:55.424 --> 47:57.564
- Ron, you can't play if
you're not gonna do a forfeit.

47:57.598 --> 47:59.566
- Well, let's think of
a better forfeit, right?

47:59.600 --> 48:01.775
How about, I was--
- Ron.

48:01.809 --> 48:03.915
- Right on the chairs.
- One, two, three.

48:03.950 --> 48:06.021
- Stop talking you out
of it and pick a cup.

48:06.055 --> 48:07.263
- Yeah, pick a cup, Ron.

48:07.298 --> 48:08.920
- Christ of lights.
- Come on.

48:08.955 --> 48:09.921
I believe in you.

48:09.956 --> 48:12.268
[giggling]

48:12.303 --> 48:14.788
- [Ron] One, two, three.

48:14.822 --> 48:16.031
[cheering]

48:16.065 --> 48:18.136
- [Marcus] Yes, yes, yes, yes!

48:18.171 --> 48:19.897
- I am not going [mumbles].
- Bad luck, Ronnie boy.

48:19.931 --> 48:21.553
- No way, I am not
going to do that.

48:21.588 --> 48:23.141
You might think
I'm right stupid--

48:23.176 --> 48:25.316
- Time to pay your dues.
- I'm not going to do that.

48:25.350 --> 48:26.800
- Ron, you've got to.
- No, no, no.

48:26.834 --> 48:28.526
- You can't play if you're
not gonna do a forfeit

48:28.560 --> 48:29.630
or what's the point of playing?

48:29.665 --> 48:30.942
- Well, for the fun of it.

48:30.977 --> 48:32.461
- That's boring,
come on, just do it!

48:32.495 --> 48:34.221
- Yeah, come on,
Ron, I did mine.

48:34.256 --> 48:35.878
- If there's no punishment,
there's no point in playing.

48:35.913 --> 48:37.500
- Yours wasn't so bad, Abbi.

48:37.535 --> 48:38.881
- Mine was?

48:38.916 --> 48:40.055
I [mumbles] hair!

48:40.089 --> 48:41.539
- Come on, mate.
- I think [mumbles].

48:41.573 --> 48:44.059
No way, I'll leave that
stuff to you two young ones.

48:44.093 --> 48:45.370
- Okay, then you
can't play anymore.

48:45.405 --> 48:47.131
- Okay, I'll sit and
watch you two play.

48:47.165 --> 48:49.271
- No, you can't watch us, if
you don't do your forfeit,

48:49.305 --> 48:50.617
you've got to wait
in the bathroom.

48:50.651 --> 48:52.170
- Oh, what?
- Yeah.

48:52.205 --> 48:53.413
You got to wait in there.

48:53.447 --> 48:54.655
- Why don't we
change the forfeit?

48:54.690 --> 48:57.072
- It's okay, Abbi,
you know what I'll do?

48:57.106 --> 48:59.488
I'm gonna grab a couple
of books and I'm gonna

48:59.522 --> 49:00.834
sit on me throne.
- Good.

49:00.868 --> 49:03.733
- Actually, I'll
have a bath, yeah.

49:03.768 --> 49:05.666
- On you go.
- Nice couple of books here,

49:05.701 --> 49:08.014
I'll just sit and have
a soak and have a read.

49:08.048 --> 49:09.567
- You can't come
out until we say so.

49:09.601 --> 49:12.156
- [Ron] Fine, fine, cool,
cool, have fun, good luck.

49:14.952 --> 49:16.574
- [Abbi] Oh my god.

49:16.608 --> 49:18.610
- I wish he'd done the forfeit,
I really wish he'd done it.

49:18.645 --> 49:20.060
- I know, that would
have been so great.

49:20.095 --> 49:22.131
- It would have been so funny.

49:22.166 --> 49:23.374
He didn't wear his
swimming shorts

49:23.408 --> 49:24.823
again, did he?

49:24.858 --> 49:26.239
- I think he goes
in there naked.

49:26.273 --> 49:28.482
- Oh my god, I feel
sorry for that cameraman.

49:28.517 --> 49:29.656
- [Abbi] I know.

49:29.690 --> 49:31.416
- Right, let's play.
- Let's do it.

49:32.417 --> 49:33.315
[cheering]

49:33.349 --> 49:34.454
- [Marcus] Feeling pumped!

49:38.354 --> 49:39.942
I'm gonna do it sat down
- Yeah.

49:41.219 --> 49:42.876
- I'm not even gonna think
about it, it's like trying

49:42.910 --> 49:45.016
to be cool about the whole
thing, hey, how's it going?

49:45.051 --> 49:46.052
What's your name,
where you from?

49:47.225 --> 49:48.882
- [Abbi] That would
have been so nice.

49:50.056 --> 49:51.747
Yeah, what are you
up to next week?

49:53.404 --> 49:58.167
- Oh my god, oh my goodness!

49:58.202 --> 50:02.275
Smashed it out of the
park, gone, see you later.

50:02.309 --> 50:03.552
- Can't believe that.

50:03.586 --> 50:05.243
- I'm embarrassed
to have a go now.

50:05.278 --> 50:06.555
[laughing]

50:06.589 --> 50:08.557
- [Abbi] That's
great, go on, do it.

50:08.591 --> 50:12.630
- Okay, fine, fine, all
right, I'm not gonna look.

50:19.602 --> 50:22.260
[soft clicking]

50:38.242 --> 50:40.278
[typing]

53:38.629 --> 53:41.079
... just them, it all could be.

53:42.357 --> 53:44.531
- I'm hungry and
I wanted to eat.

53:44.566 --> 53:47.431
- Well, we're all in the
same boat here, Marcus

53:47.465 --> 53:49.398
- So we're just gonna
be left to starve, then.

53:49.433 --> 53:50.813
- Well, no, of course not.
- So what?

53:50.848 --> 53:52.850
- I think we all need to
agree, right, when someone goes

53:52.884 --> 53:54.092
to eat something, right?

53:55.301 --> 53:57.441
- Okay, all right, then.

53:57.475 --> 53:59.374
Can I eat the biscuits?

53:59.408 --> 54:01.203
I say yes, Abbi?

54:02.031 --> 54:04.102
- [Abbi] Um, yeah.

54:04.137 --> 54:05.656
- That's the majority.

54:05.690 --> 54:07.278
- Well, no, we should all agree.

54:08.383 --> 54:09.487
- Come on!

54:09.522 --> 54:11.178
- Well yes, of course, if
we all agree then that's

54:11.213 --> 54:12.697
a proper democracy.

54:12.732 --> 54:14.181
- Is it?

54:14.216 --> 54:18.185
Sorry, I wasn't aware
that was proper democracy.

54:18.220 --> 54:19.428
- I think if we're
all in agreement,

54:19.463 --> 54:20.843
then we'll all be happy.

54:20.878 --> 54:23.777
I mean, you ate the last
of the salt and vinegar

54:23.812 --> 54:25.400
crisps as well and
the last of the eggs.

54:25.434 --> 54:27.194
- Yeah, but I can't
drink the long life milk,

54:27.229 --> 54:29.300
you know that,
you can drink tea.

54:29.335 --> 54:30.128
- Yeah, that's true.

54:30.163 --> 54:31.475
- So there you go.

54:31.509 --> 54:33.270
- I just think we should
all be in agreement.

54:33.304 --> 54:36.687
- Yeah, you had the
tea, I had the eggs.

54:36.721 --> 54:39.862
- But with everything,
like the biscuits,

54:39.897 --> 54:41.554
we can't just go eating them.

54:41.588 --> 54:43.418
Anyway, they were the
prizes, what are we gonna do

54:43.452 --> 54:44.350
for prizes now?

54:44.384 --> 54:45.937
- Fuck knows and fuck cares.

54:45.972 --> 54:47.836
- And anyway, you only don't
drink the milk 'cause you

54:47.870 --> 54:50.045
don't like it, it's not
'cause you can't drink it.

54:50.079 --> 54:50.873
- What?

54:50.908 --> 54:52.358
Fuck off!

54:52.392 --> 54:54.601
Just 'cause I don't drink
that shit, tastes like shit.

54:54.636 --> 54:57.086
- Yeah but--
- I'm not gonna drink it.

54:57.121 --> 54:59.157
- Well, we're all
in this together.

54:59.192 --> 55:02.402
- Anyway, it's fair enough
I had the eggs, I'm the one

55:02.437 --> 55:05.716
working out here, I'm
the one needs proteins.

55:05.750 --> 55:07.027
- We all need proteins.

55:07.062 --> 55:09.444
- Yeah, but you're not
working out, though.

55:09.478 --> 55:12.792
- Yeah, but we still all
need protein, though.

55:12.826 --> 55:17.831
What I mean is we need to
work together as a team, yeah?

55:19.488 --> 55:22.077
What if it's like you said?

55:22.111 --> 55:26.599
Like some sort of a survival
show, except this time,

55:26.633 --> 55:30.016
it's in a house and not in the
outback or something, yeah?

55:31.466 --> 55:33.433
They're doing this 'cause
they wanna see how we all

55:33.468 --> 55:35.297
get on together, yeah?

55:36.402 --> 55:38.093
That's what it's
all about, isn't it?

55:39.301 --> 55:41.234
- Just feels like
we've been forgotten.

55:43.132 --> 55:45.031
- That's what it is, isn't it?

55:45.065 --> 55:46.446
To see how we all get on.

55:48.655 --> 55:51.762
- Great, sounds fucking great.

55:51.796 --> 55:53.453
- Oh, come on, think about it.

55:54.868 --> 55:57.388
What if there's a whole bunch
of other people involved?

55:57.423 --> 56:01.219
Groups of three other people
all in different locations

56:01.254 --> 56:03.981
and they're all in it
like this, like us, yeah?

56:04.015 --> 56:06.708
And what if it's like
a competition, yeah?

56:06.742 --> 56:09.849
What's that show where
there's a big bunch of people

56:09.883 --> 56:12.369
and they're all on the
run and it's a competition

56:12.403 --> 56:15.302
to see who can be on
the run for the longest.

56:15.337 --> 56:16.407
- [Abbi] Yeah, yeah.

56:16.442 --> 56:17.857
- What's it called?

56:17.891 --> 56:19.065
- Hunted.
- Hunted, yeah, yeah,

56:19.099 --> 56:21.447
that's it, what if
it's like that, yeah?

56:21.481 --> 56:24.242
See who can stay on the
run for the longest, yeah?

56:25.658 --> 56:28.005
Maybe that's what we've got
to do, make sure we don't use

56:28.039 --> 56:30.179
up all the stuff
straightaway, keep it going,

56:30.214 --> 56:34.321
ticking over like, and
maybe we'll be the last ones

56:34.356 --> 56:35.392
on the run.

56:37.117 --> 56:39.119
That's why it was so
secretive, you know, getting

56:39.154 --> 56:41.708
here like, yeah, 'cause
they didn't want anyone

56:41.743 --> 56:44.193
to know of, maybe that's
where the prize is.

56:45.367 --> 56:47.438
- It'd just be nice if
we had something to do.

56:48.715 --> 56:49.578
- We ain't gonna.

56:50.855 --> 56:52.236
- [Ron] Well, this
is it, you know.

56:53.651 --> 56:54.549
Keep us here.

56:58.380 --> 57:01.141
[water trickling]

58:25.571 --> 58:27.745
- Oh, light's gone out.

58:27.780 --> 58:29.402
- Really?
- Yeah.

58:29.436 --> 58:30.783
Bulb in that light.

58:47.454 --> 58:52.356
- Maybe it's because something
terrible just happened.

58:55.497 --> 58:58.880
No, my mum always used
to say that to me.

58:58.914 --> 59:01.676
That when a light bulb
goes out like that,

59:01.710 --> 59:05.231
it's because something terrible
just happened in the world.

59:06.715 --> 59:08.475
- Huh.
- Yeah.

59:11.409 --> 59:14.171
[water dripping]

01:00:04.497 --> 01:00:05.912
... my fucking contract.

01:00:05.947 --> 01:00:07.742
- Marcus, how do you
think we're going to win

01:00:08.881 --> 01:00:10.054
if we keep throwing
the food around?

01:00:10.089 --> 01:00:11.642
- I don't give a fucking
shit about winning.

01:00:11.677 --> 01:00:13.161
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:00:13.195 --> 01:00:15.612
I wanna see my contract
or I'm gonna fucking walk.

01:00:15.646 --> 01:00:16.682
- [Ron] Marcus,
just relax, yeah?

01:00:16.716 --> 01:00:17.993
- Fuck off, okay?

01:00:18.028 --> 01:00:19.477
I wanna see my contract.

01:00:19.512 --> 01:00:21.065
- Marcus--
- Tell me how much fucking

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:23.930
longer I'm gonna be in
this fucking shithole.

01:00:23.965 --> 01:00:26.312
- Marcus, Marcus, they're
not gonna show us a contract,

01:00:26.346 --> 01:00:27.520
it doesn't work like that.

01:00:27.554 --> 01:00:29.798
- Fuck off, Ron, I
know my rights, okay?

01:00:29.833 --> 01:00:33.008
I wanna see my fucking
contract, or someone please

01:00:33.043 --> 01:00:36.598
fucking tell me how much longer
I'm gonna be in here, man,

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:39.428
and give us some fucking
proper food, man, and some

01:00:39.463 --> 01:00:42.121
fucking air man, I
wanna go outside!

01:00:42.155 --> 01:00:44.088
It's fucked up keeping us
in here, we're like fucking

01:00:44.123 --> 01:00:46.159
prisoners.
- Marcus, Marcus.

01:00:46.194 --> 01:00:48.575
- Fuck, I want some air.
- Marcus, all right.

01:00:48.610 --> 01:00:50.647
All right.
- And not this shit, please.

01:00:50.681 --> 01:00:52.269
- Marcus, they're not gonna
keep us in here forever.

01:00:52.303 --> 01:00:54.512
We just need to keep
calm and carry on,

01:00:54.547 --> 01:00:56.411
that's what we've
got to do, yeah?

01:00:56.445 --> 01:00:57.377
- You know what

01:00:57.412 --> 01:00:59.483
fuck it, I'm done, I'm out.

01:00:59.517 --> 01:01:00.691
- Marcus, you can't leave now.

01:01:00.726 --> 01:01:02.935
- I don't see my
contract, I am out.

01:01:02.969 --> 01:01:05.385
I want some fucking air.
- Come on, Marcus.

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:06.663
- And some fucking sun.

01:01:06.697 --> 01:01:07.974
- Marcus, Marcus.
- No, I'm serious.

01:01:08.009 --> 01:01:09.666
- You can't go.
- I'm fucking out, I'm done.

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:11.771
- Come on, come on.
- No no no, I'm serious.

01:01:11.806 --> 01:01:16.224
Or give us some fucking
decent food, then, all right?

01:01:16.258 --> 01:01:19.952
I want some fucking
eggs or a protein shake.

01:01:19.986 --> 01:01:22.161
Yeah, a fucking protein shake.

01:01:22.195 --> 01:01:24.025
- Marcus, I'm sure they will.

01:01:24.059 --> 01:01:25.578
- And some more
fucking toothpaste.

01:01:25.612 --> 01:01:27.614
- You've just squirted the
toothpaste down the sink.

01:01:27.649 --> 01:01:29.513
- Well, they should give us
some more, shouldn't they?

01:01:29.547 --> 01:01:32.861
Treat us like fucking
humans and not like shit.

01:01:32.896 --> 01:01:34.345
- Marcus...
- You know, fuck it,

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:35.864
I can't be fucked anymore.

01:01:35.899 --> 01:01:37.107
- Marcus--
- Eeither you give me what

01:01:37.141 --> 01:01:39.696
I want or I'm out.
- Marcus, we will lose

01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:41.145
if you walk through that door.

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:42.733
- I don't fucking care, okay?

01:01:42.768 --> 01:01:45.218
I wanna see a printed
copy of my contract

01:01:45.253 --> 01:01:48.256
in the next 30
seconds or I'm out.

01:01:48.290 --> 01:01:50.223
- Marcus, think about
your fans, yeah, yeah?

01:01:50.258 --> 01:01:52.639
You think they're gonna
wanna see you leave?

01:01:52.674 --> 01:01:55.021
- Oh, fuck off, Ron, no one's
watching this fucking shit!

01:01:55.056 --> 01:01:56.333
- You serious?
- Us sat around here

01:01:56.367 --> 01:01:58.438
and doing fuck all, all day.
- Oh Marcus.

01:01:58.473 --> 01:01:59.785
- It's a fucking
joke, man, I'm done.

01:01:59.819 --> 01:02:01.200
- Are you serious?

01:02:01.234 --> 01:02:03.133
They'll be millions of
people watching us right now.

01:02:03.167 --> 01:02:04.824
Watching this, this
very moment, yeah

01:02:04.859 --> 01:02:07.240
- Like fuck, 20 seconds.

01:02:07.275 --> 01:02:09.726
- Oh, Marcus.
- 19, 18.

01:02:10.796 --> 01:02:12.038
- I can't believe
you're a quitter, mate.

01:02:12.073 --> 01:02:16.008
- 17, 16.
- Oh Marcus, Marcus.

01:02:16.042 --> 01:02:17.285
- 15.
- Oh, you're ruining it

01:02:17.319 --> 01:02:19.011
for us, you know?
- 14.

01:02:19.045 --> 01:02:20.909
- Think about me and Abbi.
- 13.

01:02:20.944 --> 01:02:22.808
- We're not ready to leave yet.

01:02:22.842 --> 01:02:24.602
- [Marcus] 12, 11.

01:02:24.637 --> 01:02:25.672
- Oh Marcus, Marcus.
- 10.

01:02:25.707 --> 01:02:26.812
- At least give them
- Nine.

01:02:26.846 --> 01:02:27.951
- five minutes to sort
- Eight.

01:02:27.985 --> 01:02:28.883
- Something out, yeah?

01:02:28.917 --> 01:02:30.194
And then you can have a proper
- Seven.

01:02:30.229 --> 01:02:31.264
- think about it,
- Six.

01:02:31.299 --> 01:02:32.714
- and not do anything rash.
- Five.

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:37.754
Four, three, two.
- Marcus, Marcus.

01:02:38.409 --> 01:02:39.238
- One.

01:02:40.204 --> 01:02:41.585
Right.
[knocking]

01:02:41.619 --> 01:02:42.517
Where are you?

01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:45.382
- Marcus, just--
- No one?

01:02:46.417 --> 01:02:47.660
Okay, cool.
- Sit down, sit down.

01:02:47.694 --> 01:02:49.006
- Well done, open
the fucking door.

01:02:49.041 --> 01:02:50.801
- [Ron] I'll make you a nice
cup of hot chocolate, yeah?

01:02:50.836 --> 01:02:52.147
- Open the fucking
door, I'm done.

01:02:52.182 --> 01:02:53.114
- Marcus--
- I'm out.

01:02:53.148 --> 01:02:54.805
- Sit down, yeah, Marcus?

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:55.633
[knocking]

01:02:55.668 --> 01:02:57.152
- Open the fucking door!

01:02:57.187 --> 01:02:59.499
- Give them a chance, they
might not be there yet.

01:02:59.534 --> 01:03:02.157
- Oi, open the fucking
door and let me out!

01:03:02.192 --> 01:03:03.365
- Just give them a second!

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:05.712
Marcus, Marcus,
calm down a minute.

01:03:05.747 --> 01:03:07.611
- The fuck you gonna do!

01:03:07.645 --> 01:03:09.889
Fuck off!
[screaming]

01:03:09.924 --> 01:03:10.821
[mumbles]

01:03:10.856 --> 01:03:13.444
Fucking done, mate, done.

01:03:13.479 --> 01:03:16.793
I told you, let me
fucking out of here now!

01:03:16.827 --> 01:03:20.727
Now, I told you, I gave
you the fucking chance,

01:03:21.832 --> 01:03:23.972
just let me out!
[banging on each word]

01:03:24.007 --> 01:03:26.078
- [Ron] Calm down!

01:03:26.112 --> 01:03:26.906
- [Marcus] I'm fucking done!

01:03:26.941 --> 01:03:27.942
[crashing]

01:03:27.976 --> 01:03:30.082
You, seriously, fuck you!

01:03:31.393 --> 01:03:33.602
- The fuck!
[screaming]

01:03:33.637 --> 01:03:37.192
- Shut the fuck up, don't
touch the fucking cameras!

01:03:37.227 --> 01:03:38.987
If you try and bash your
way out of here again,

01:03:39.022 --> 01:03:42.749
I swear I'll shoot you,
I'll fucking do it.

01:03:43.647 --> 01:03:45.097
Got it, got it?

01:03:45.131 --> 01:03:46.788
- [Marcus] Fuck yeah, yeah,
I've got it, I've got it.

01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:47.651
- Right.

01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:55.038
- Oh, fuck.

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:58.835
- What the fuck?

01:03:59.697 --> 01:04:00.871
Oh god, we're fucked.

01:04:00.906 --> 01:04:02.459
- [Abbi] What?

01:04:02.493 --> 01:04:04.841
[chuckling]

01:04:06.014 --> 01:04:07.878
- That was brilliant!

01:04:07.913 --> 01:04:10.260
Oh dear, that was class!

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.126
Oh, they've really
got you, haven't they?

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.610
- What?

01:04:15.644 --> 01:04:17.508
- [Ron] They can't pull
the wool over my eyes.

01:04:17.543 --> 01:04:18.751
- What are you talking about?

01:04:18.785 --> 01:04:20.926
- They've totally
got you, don't they?

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:22.203
- [Marcus] We're fucking
trapped, what the fuck

01:04:22.237 --> 01:04:23.687
you talking about?
- What, what?

01:04:23.721 --> 01:04:24.930
- [Marcus] Don't you get it?

01:04:24.964 --> 01:04:26.483
We can't get out, we're
fucking trapped in here.

01:04:26.517 --> 01:04:28.554
- Oh my god, they've really
got you going, haven't they?

01:04:28.588 --> 01:04:29.831
- [Marcus] Ron, he
just came in here

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:31.315
with a fucking gun, okay?

01:04:31.350 --> 01:04:33.697
He's been there all this
fucking time and we can't

01:04:33.731 --> 01:04:34.629
fucking get out.

01:04:34.663 --> 01:04:36.873
- He's not real, he's an actor.

01:04:36.907 --> 01:04:38.391
- [Marcus] Ron, he's
got a fucking gun, mate!

01:04:38.426 --> 01:04:41.325
- [Ron] That wasn't a
real gun, it was a fake,

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:43.465
it was a prop, don't you get it?

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.951
This is all part of a show!

01:04:45.985 --> 01:04:48.539
- Ron, what the fuck
are you talking about?

01:04:48.574 --> 01:04:50.265
We're being fucking
held hostage.

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:52.336
[laughing]

01:04:52.371 --> 01:04:54.062
- Hostage, is that
what you think?

01:04:54.097 --> 01:04:56.168
Oh, they're all laughing
at you now, sonny,

01:04:56.202 --> 01:04:59.033
you hear me, all of them out
there, they're all laughing

01:04:59.067 --> 01:05:01.104
at you right now.

01:05:01.138 --> 01:05:02.277
- Go ahead, try and leave.

01:05:02.312 --> 01:05:04.003
- I don't want to leave.
- No, go on, try.

01:05:04.038 --> 01:05:06.695
- I don't want to, I'm having
the time of my life in here.

01:05:06.730 --> 01:05:08.007
- You try and leave
and you won't fucking

01:05:08.042 --> 01:05:09.491
be able to.

01:05:09.526 --> 01:05:11.528
- [Ron] Oh, this is so
funny, this is brilliant.

01:05:11.562 --> 01:05:14.669
- Ron, what the fuck
are we gonna do then?

01:05:14.703 --> 01:05:16.878
- [Ron] Just go with the
flow, enjoy it, yeah?

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:18.328
- [Abbi] What's going on?

01:05:18.362 --> 01:05:19.950
- We're being fucking held
here against our will.

01:05:19.985 --> 01:05:21.641
- [Ron] No, come on.

01:05:21.676 --> 01:05:23.298
- By that fucking guy.
- We're not.

01:05:23.333 --> 01:05:24.644
- He's not gonna hurt us, right?

01:05:24.679 --> 01:05:25.887
- [Marcus] He's
got a fucking gun!

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:27.199
- Of course not.

01:05:27.233 --> 01:05:29.028
- [Ron] They had to
come in here to stop him

01:05:29.063 --> 01:05:29.995
from going crazy,

01:05:30.029 --> 01:05:31.410
didn't they?
- Ron, it's just

01:05:31.444 --> 01:05:33.791
him in there by himself
making sure we don't

01:05:33.826 --> 01:05:35.034
fucking leave.
- James.

01:05:35.069 --> 01:05:36.829
- Yeah, James, whatever
the fuck his name is.

01:05:36.863 --> 01:05:41.144
- Abbi, Abbi, it's an actor,
sent in to mix things up.

01:05:41.178 --> 01:05:43.008
It's only gone
and bloody worked.

01:05:43.042 --> 01:05:44.492
- Haven't seen
anyone from the show.

01:05:44.526 --> 01:05:45.734
- Isn't that what
it's all about?

01:05:45.769 --> 01:05:47.288
- No, it's fucking
not, Abbi, okay?

01:05:47.322 --> 01:05:48.772
Ron doesn't know
what's going on.

01:05:48.806 --> 01:05:50.567
He thinks he does, but he don't.

01:05:50.601 --> 01:05:51.706
- He's probably listening.

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:53.018
- I don't give a shit, okay?

01:05:53.052 --> 01:05:56.331
Think about it, no one
knows we're here, okay?

01:05:56.366 --> 01:05:59.748
We haven't talked to anyone
about where we're really going.

01:05:59.783 --> 01:06:02.096
We didn't bring our mobile
phones, we didn't use our

01:06:02.130 --> 01:06:05.375
bankcards on the journey here,
no one knows where the fuck

01:06:05.409 --> 01:06:06.893
we are, okay?

01:06:06.928 --> 01:06:09.448
We're completely untraceable,
we could be fucking anywhere

01:06:09.482 --> 01:06:10.932
and now we're fucking
trapped in here.

01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:12.969
- Trapped?
- Did you see what happened?

01:06:14.349 --> 01:06:15.833
- How long are we
gonna be in here for?

01:06:15.868 --> 01:06:18.975
- [Marcus] I don't know,
as long as he wants, okay?

01:06:19.009 --> 01:06:20.286
'Cause we can't fucking get out.

01:06:20.321 --> 01:06:21.839
- But someone's gonna come
and get us though, right?

01:06:21.874 --> 01:06:22.806
- I fucking hope so.

01:06:25.050 --> 01:06:27.466
But how are they gonna
know where to look?

01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:31.056
- [Abbi] Maybe we can send
out some sort of message?

01:06:31.090 --> 01:06:32.989
What was the name of
the road we were on?

01:06:33.023 --> 01:06:35.094
- Abbi, no one is
fucking watching, okay?

01:06:35.129 --> 01:06:36.889
It ain't a show.

01:06:36.923 --> 01:06:39.478
We've been here for fuck
knows how long and we haven't

01:06:39.512 --> 01:06:41.273
seen anyone from the show, okay?

01:06:41.307 --> 01:06:43.965
There is no fucking show
as far as I'm concerned,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.141
it's just him in
there watching us.

01:06:48.521 --> 01:06:50.489
- [Abbi] We're on
the website, though.

01:06:50.523 --> 01:06:51.593
- Maybe there is no website.

01:06:51.628 --> 01:06:53.492
- No, there is, I went
on it before I came in.

01:06:53.526 --> 01:06:55.597
- So did I too, but he might
have fucking taken that down

01:06:55.632 --> 01:06:57.116
by now, so there's
no one watching.

01:06:57.151 --> 01:06:59.049
- But then why so many cameras?

01:06:59.084 --> 01:07:00.637
- I don't know.

01:07:00.671 --> 01:07:01.465
For him...

01:07:03.847 --> 01:07:06.850
[sighing]
Oh, fuck.

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:12.511
Or maybe there are people
watching and we're on some

01:07:12.545 --> 01:07:15.548
website and people are paying
to watch us get fucking

01:07:15.583 --> 01:07:17.619
tortured here.
- What?

01:07:17.654 --> 01:07:19.104
- Yeah, we're fucking
trapped, aren't we?

01:07:19.138 --> 01:07:21.071
Watch us be imprisoned,
go fucking mental in here.

01:07:21.106 --> 01:07:23.211
- What kind of people would
watch something like that?

01:07:23.246 --> 01:07:25.662
- I don't know, there's a
lot of dark websites online,

01:07:25.696 --> 01:07:27.940
Abbi, a lot of sick
fucking people, okay?

01:07:27.974 --> 01:07:29.976
Think about all those
weird snuff sites.

01:07:32.358 --> 01:07:34.740
- If there are people watching,
then surely we can just

01:07:34.774 --> 01:07:37.639
send out a message and
someone will come and get us.

01:07:37.674 --> 01:07:41.057
- Yeah, yeah, it's worth trying.

01:07:43.714 --> 01:07:44.543
Fuck...

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:47.891
Okay.

01:07:49.341 --> 01:07:51.722
We need to figure out a way
to get the fuck out of here.

01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:53.621
Okay?

01:07:53.655 --> 01:07:54.725
- Yeah, okay.

01:07:57.142 --> 01:07:58.074
What do you think?

01:08:00.214 --> 01:08:01.111
- Let's not, okay?

01:08:03.803 --> 01:08:06.530
- Mmhm, right.

01:08:06.565 --> 01:08:07.704
[sighing]

01:08:07.738 --> 01:08:11.915
[Ron singing]

01:08:39.322 --> 01:08:42.877
âª Mary Jane, Mary Jane

01:08:42.911 --> 01:08:46.743
[Ron singing]

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:53.810
- Come on, you two,
liven up a bit.

01:09:56.399 --> 01:09:59.574
You're not exactly being
very entertaining, are you?

01:10:02.439 --> 01:10:04.683
Like a bloody morgue in here.

01:10:07.375 --> 01:10:09.653
[groaning]

01:10:13.692 --> 01:10:14.934
Chuffin' hell!

01:10:17.661 --> 01:10:18.593
Oh my god!

01:10:28.396 --> 01:10:33.401
Guys, guys, Marcus, Abbi, check
this out, come look at this!

01:10:34.299 --> 01:10:36.197
There's loads of stuff!

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:38.682
[laughing]

01:10:38.717 --> 01:10:39.787
Toilet paper!

01:10:44.032 --> 01:10:47.553
Milk, Marcus, it's milk!

01:10:47.588 --> 01:10:50.142
[laughing]

01:10:50.176 --> 01:10:51.592
Yeah?

01:10:51.626 --> 01:10:54.664
Look, beers, yeah,
beers as well.

01:10:56.976 --> 01:10:59.116
This is our lucky day.

01:10:59.151 --> 01:11:02.050
What did I tell you, what
did I tell you, yeah?

01:11:02.085 --> 01:11:03.224
- Toothpaste.

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:05.813
- Oh my god, oh, yes, yes, yes!

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:09.575
What did I say?
- Tuna.

01:11:09.610 --> 01:11:11.197
- What did I say, they
have been listening, yeah?

01:11:11.232 --> 01:11:12.233
All this time, yeah?

01:11:13.614 --> 01:11:16.202
Oh, we're gonna have a party
today, guys, we're gonna

01:11:16.237 --> 01:11:18.135
have a party today.

01:11:18.170 --> 01:11:19.999
Marcus, stick the
kettle on, yeah?

01:11:20.034 --> 01:11:22.692
Oh, yes!
- Crumpets.

01:11:22.726 --> 01:11:23.555
Fantastic.

01:11:26.351 --> 01:11:27.421
- Biscuits...

01:11:28.629 --> 01:11:30.216
- Hey, we're gonna a nice
breakfast in the morning!

01:11:30.251 --> 01:11:31.079
- Cereal.

01:11:32.667 --> 01:11:36.188
- Lovely, great stuff,
chicken, fantastic.

01:11:37.741 --> 01:11:39.709
- Chocolate fingers.

01:11:39.743 --> 01:11:40.951
- [Ron] My favorites.

01:11:41.987 --> 01:11:42.815
Look...

01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.784
- Drinks.

01:11:50.202 --> 01:11:50.996
Noodles.

01:11:56.381 --> 01:11:59.591
- Chick peas, not my favorite.

01:11:59.625 --> 01:12:02.525
[gentle clattering]

01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:31.234
[soft whispering]

01:13:40.243 --> 01:13:42.383
- [Marcus] Stay by
the door and listen,

01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:45.041
he must go out at some
point to go shopping.

01:13:45.075 --> 01:13:46.007
- [Abbi] Maybe.

01:13:46.042 --> 01:13:47.388
- [Marcus] Stay by
the door, and listen.

01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:51.496
- For a meal or
whatever, go for a walk.

01:13:53.670 --> 01:13:55.845
Maybe we could have a
trip to the park, yeah?

01:13:55.879 --> 01:13:58.744
Nice little stroll up
there, go to that cafe

01:13:58.779 --> 01:14:01.506
at the top of the hill,
have a nice pot of tea

01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:03.577
and a slice of cake.

01:14:03.611 --> 01:14:06.442
Good bit of carrot cake they
do there, do you remember?

01:14:09.237 --> 01:14:12.655
I expect you'll go for the
Victoria's sponge, as ever.

01:14:12.689 --> 01:14:13.518
Oh yes.

01:14:17.729 --> 01:14:19.731
Be nice to stretch
the old legs, though.

01:14:21.526 --> 01:14:22.665
Get a breath of fresh air.

01:14:26.323 --> 01:14:30.362
I would imagine you meeting
up with Julia today, hope so.

01:14:31.708 --> 01:14:34.918
Have a good old natter and
hopefully you're watching this.

01:14:36.506 --> 01:14:37.438
Hi, Julia.

01:14:39.026 --> 01:14:39.854
Hi, everyone.

01:14:50.555 --> 01:14:51.970
I'll make it up to you, love.

01:14:53.730 --> 01:14:56.733
Actually, I've got a nice
little surprise in mind,

01:14:56.768 --> 01:14:59.253
so you best get
ready for that, yeah?

01:15:06.398 --> 01:15:08.849
I'm sorry I can't be
there for your big day.

01:15:13.681 --> 01:15:14.717
That's for you, love.

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:25.728
I hope all them
checkups went well.

01:15:32.458 --> 01:15:35.634
- Can you turn the
lights on, please?

01:15:35.669 --> 01:15:37.394
Hello, can you
turn the lights on?

01:15:46.956 --> 01:15:47.750
[knocking]

01:15:47.784 --> 01:15:48.613
Hello?

01:15:51.236 --> 01:15:53.583
[knocking]

01:15:53.618 --> 01:15:54.446
Hello?

01:15:55.343 --> 01:15:57.622
[knocking]

01:15:57.656 --> 01:16:00.038
[clattering]

01:16:01.902 --> 01:16:03.041
Fuck!

01:16:03.766 --> 01:16:05.215
Give me the spatula.

01:16:09.150 --> 01:16:10.324
- [Marcus] Fuck!

01:16:12.188 --> 01:16:12.982
- Hello, help!

01:16:15.950 --> 01:16:16.779

01:16:19.367 --> 01:16:20.714
- Someone fucking help us!

01:16:20.748 --> 01:16:21.818
- We're stuck inside!

01:16:21.853 --> 01:16:23.302
- Guys, guys, guys!

01:16:26.029 --> 01:16:28.791
- Help!
- Guys, guys, guys!

01:16:28.825 --> 01:16:30.447
What are you doing?

01:16:33.174 --> 01:16:34.417
- Shut up, you, shut up.

01:16:34.451 --> 01:16:36.315
- Yeah, yeah, for
god's sake, guys.

01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:39.629
- You do this again, I
swear I'll shoot you.

01:16:39.664 --> 01:16:41.079
I swear I'll do it.

01:16:43.219 --> 01:16:45.117
- Please don't do this, okay?

01:16:45.152 --> 01:16:46.532
It's not worth it.

01:16:46.567 --> 01:16:48.534
- Marcus, don't you know yet?
- You don't have to do this

01:16:48.569 --> 01:16:50.295
to us, please, we're so young.

01:16:50.329 --> 01:16:51.537
Please.
- Marcus, for god's sake,

01:16:51.572 --> 01:16:52.746
this isn't real.
- Please, please.

01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:53.919
- Marcus, don't you get it yet?

01:16:53.954 --> 01:16:55.334
- We need some air.

01:16:55.369 --> 01:16:56.922
- Ron, shut the fuck up!
- Don't you get it?

01:16:56.957 --> 01:16:57.647
- Ron!

01:16:57.682 --> 01:16:59.511
Please, please, just let us go.

01:16:59.545 --> 01:17:00.477
- Oh, for god's sake, look--

01:17:00.512 --> 01:17:01.513
[all talking over one another]

01:17:01.547 --> 01:17:06.276
[gun firing]
[screaming]

01:17:06.311 --> 01:17:11.316
[panting]
[Abbi's muffled screaming]

01:17:21.291 --> 01:17:23.639
- [Marcus] Get a fucking towel.

01:17:23.673 --> 01:17:25.779
Ron, don't you fucking die
on me, don't you fucking

01:17:25.813 --> 01:17:27.850
die on me, mate.

01:17:27.884 --> 01:17:29.058
Ron?

01:17:29.092 --> 01:17:31.612
[Abbi sobbing]

01:17:31.647 --> 01:17:34.373
[Marcus panting]

01:18:39.922 --> 01:18:41.199
Abbi?

01:18:41.233 --> 01:18:43.442
Abbi, I need your help.

01:18:43.477 --> 01:18:46.411
Abbi, please, Abbi, listen
to me, listen to me,

01:18:46.445 --> 01:18:48.275
listen to me, okay?

01:18:48.309 --> 01:18:50.139
Abbi, please, I need
your help, okay?

01:18:50.173 --> 01:18:51.692
It won't take long.

01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:52.866
- Please don't make me do it.

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:54.005
- It's just me and you, okay?

01:18:54.039 --> 01:18:55.385
It's just me and you.

01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:57.008
We're a team now, okay?

01:18:57.042 --> 01:18:58.526
Abbi?

01:18:58.561 --> 01:19:00.805
Listen to me, listen

01:19:01.909 --> 01:19:04.084
[panting]

01:19:05.637 --> 01:19:09.537
I'm sorry, Ron, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry.

01:19:09.572 --> 01:19:10.504
It's gonna be okay.

01:19:14.059 --> 01:19:17.822
I've got you, I've
got you, I've got you.

01:19:17.856 --> 01:19:20.031
There we go, there we go.

01:19:20.065 --> 01:19:22.447
[panting]

01:19:22.481 --> 01:19:23.482
Fuck.

01:19:23.517 --> 01:19:25.691
[panting]

01:19:33.113 --> 01:19:35.978
[grunting]

01:19:36.012 --> 01:19:37.600
I've got you,
mate, I've got you.

01:19:37.634 --> 01:19:38.912
Okay?
[sobbing]

01:19:38.946 --> 01:19:42.812
I know they will.

01:19:42.847 --> 01:19:44.676
Look at me, look at me.

01:19:44.710 --> 01:19:45.677
People will know we're missing,

01:19:45.711 --> 01:19:46.540
Okay?

01:19:47.610 --> 01:19:50.026
- Oh my god!
- Abbi, Abbi, Abbi.

01:19:50.061 --> 01:19:55.066
Abbi, Abbi!
[sobbing]

01:19:55.929 --> 01:19:57.068
People will know we're missing.

01:19:57.102 --> 01:19:58.276
They'll be searching
for us, okay?

01:19:58.310 --> 01:20:00.865
Somehow, they'll
fucking find us.

01:20:00.899 --> 01:20:02.659
I know they will, okay?

01:20:02.694 --> 01:20:04.178
We're in the middle
of a fucking city,

01:20:04.213 --> 01:20:06.836
they'll fucking

01:20:06.871 --> 01:20:08.389
Abbi, please.

01:20:08.424 --> 01:20:10.046
- What are we gonna do?

01:20:12.014 --> 01:20:13.947
Abbi, you've got to believe
me, you've got to believe me.

01:20:13.981 --> 01:20:16.846
Abbi, Abbi, believe me, okay?

01:20:16.881 --> 01:20:19.538
Fuck, we're gonna
get through this.

01:20:19.573 --> 01:20:20.505
Abbi?

01:20:20.539 --> 01:20:25.544
Shh, shh.
[wild sobbing]

01:20:28.616 --> 01:20:30.998
Abbi, Abbi, Abbi, Abbi, Abbi.

01:20:32.448 --> 01:20:35.727
Please, [mumbles],
just breathe, okay?

01:20:35.761 --> 01:20:37.211
We're fucking gonna get
through this, we are not

01:20:37.246 --> 01:20:38.868
gonna fucking die in here, okay?

01:20:38.903 --> 01:20:42.044
We are not gonna fucking
die in here, all right?

01:20:42.078 --> 01:20:43.700
- Oh my god.
- All right?

01:20:43.735 --> 01:20:46.531
- It's okay, they
have to find us.

01:20:47.463 --> 01:20:48.774
They'll find us.

01:20:49.637 --> 01:20:52.330
[water sloshing]

01:21:55.703 --> 01:21:57.843
[sobbing]

01:21:59.259 --> 01:22:00.018
- Sorry.

01:22:03.711 --> 01:22:04.540
Please...

01:22:07.853 --> 01:22:08.854
Please, mum!

01:22:11.616 --> 01:22:12.789
James, please.

01:22:17.691 --> 01:22:18.864
James, please.

01:22:20.625 --> 01:22:23.214
[wild sobbing]

01:22:30.186 --> 01:22:31.947
I just wanna go home.

01:22:33.431 --> 01:22:35.191
I just wanna go home.

01:22:44.338 --> 01:22:45.788
- Right, there we are.

01:22:45.822 --> 01:22:48.204
Give it all a toss together.

01:22:48.239 --> 01:22:50.034
There we go.
[Abbi sobbing]

01:22:50.068 --> 01:22:51.207
Just a little lemon
juice in there.

01:22:51.242 --> 01:22:53.554
- Touch of lemon juice.
- Chili, garlic.

01:22:53.589 --> 01:22:55.729
[panting]

01:23:48.954 --> 01:23:49.955
- I think...

01:23:53.683 --> 01:23:54.822
I think...

01:23:58.033 --> 01:24:00.035
The water's been poisoned.

01:24:05.074 --> 01:24:05.902
- Yeah?

01:24:07.490 --> 01:24:08.319
- Yeah.

01:24:11.218 --> 01:24:13.807
Something I've been
thinking for a while now.

01:24:18.846 --> 01:24:20.779
I can't be sure, but...

01:24:22.229 --> 01:24:23.230
Don't wanna risk it.

01:24:27.027 --> 01:24:28.373
Gonna boil it, now.

01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:34.172
Boil it before I touch it.

01:24:40.937 --> 01:24:43.664
[rain pattering]

01:24:56.953 --> 01:24:59.887
[footsteps]

01:24:59.922 --> 01:25:02.442
[bag rustling]

01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:28.123
[liquid trickling]

01:26:07.023 --> 01:26:09.164
[silence]

01:26:43.577 --> 01:26:46.408
[click of typing]

01:27:08.602 --> 01:27:11.881
[soft music]
- Help...

01:27:13.297 --> 01:27:14.159
Help me...

01:27:18.578 --> 01:27:19.406
Help...

01:27:23.065 --> 01:27:23.893
Help...

01:27:27.828 --> 01:27:29.105
Help me...

01:27:32.592 --> 01:27:33.420
Help me...

01:28:01.586 --> 01:28:03.692
[panting]

01:28:03.726 --> 01:28:06.004
[coughing]

01:28:09.387 --> 01:28:10.768
- [James] Pour a
bit in, just a bit.

01:28:10.802 --> 01:28:13.460
[both coughing]

01:28:14.427 --> 01:28:15.945
Just a bit.

01:28:15.980 --> 01:28:19.466
[both coughing violently]

01:28:20.916 --> 01:28:22.918
- There have been
cases of missing people

01:28:22.952 --> 01:28:26.301
across the UK every year,
but what has turned this case

01:28:26.335 --> 01:28:29.062
out of the ordinary is that
on the day they went missing,

01:28:29.096 --> 01:28:32.203
they were all captured on a
CC TV camera walking along

01:28:32.237 --> 01:28:35.965
this platform here in North
Bromley, just minutes apart.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.278
They all arrived by different
trains and were each

01:28:38.313 --> 01:28:39.935
carrying a suitcase.

01:28:39.969 --> 01:28:42.109
Now, what they had told
their friends and family was

01:28:42.144 --> 01:28:43.421
that they were going--

01:28:43.456 --> 01:28:46.321
[paper crinkling]

01:28:59.955 --> 01:29:02.302
- [Abbi] [mumbles] and peaches.

01:29:02.337 --> 01:29:04.269
We also wanna have
something to do.

01:29:05.512 --> 01:29:07.376
We wanna have some magazines.

01:29:08.515 --> 01:29:13.244
Some recent magazines
or papers to read.

01:29:14.487 --> 01:29:15.902
Something about the outside.

01:29:27.638 --> 01:29:29.087
[dog barking]

01:29:29.122 --> 01:29:31.296
[panting]

01:29:41.859 --> 01:29:44.689
[cameras humming]

01:29:54.872 --> 01:29:57.702
[soft clattering]

01:30:17.135 --> 01:30:21.899
[tense music]

01:30:37.501 --> 01:30:40.331
[screaming]

01:30:40.365 --> 01:30:42.816
[eerie music]

01:30:45.785 --> 01:30:48.443
[wood snapping]

01:30:51.411 --> 01:30:53.275
[screaming]
[crashing]

01:30:53.309 --> 01:30:54.449
- What are you, please--

01:30:54.483 --> 01:30:55.450
- [Marcus] Get off me!

01:30:55.484 --> 01:30:56.727
- Please, stop, stop!
- Get off me!

01:30:56.761 --> 01:30:58.453
- [Abbi] No, no, no, no!

01:30:58.487 --> 01:31:00.455
Please [mumbles], stop!

01:31:00.489 --> 01:31:01.317
Stop!

01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:03.906
- Fucking cameras!

01:31:03.941 --> 01:31:04.804
Stand up now!

01:31:07.738 --> 01:31:10.188
[clattering]

01:31:15.539 --> 01:31:17.782
[shouting]

01:32:57.433 --> 01:33:00.816
[eerie, discordant music]
