WEBVTT

00:02.233 --> 00:03.467
[children screaming]

00:03.467 --> 00:05.367
- HEY, GUYS.
COME ON, SETTLE--

00:05.367 --> 00:07.267
WHO TOLD YOU
YOU COULD HAVE THOSE--

00:07.267 --> 00:08.633
PUT THOSE BACK
WHERE YOU FOUND THEM.

00:08.633 --> 00:10.733
SETTLE DOWN.
RAY, CAN YOU HELP ME?

00:10.733 --> 00:12.867
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY,
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!

00:12.867 --> 00:16.867
LISTEN.

00:16.867 --> 00:18.033
BYE.

00:18.033 --> 00:19.567
- RAY.

00:19.567 --> 00:22.433
- [shrieking]

00:22.433 --> 00:24.200
- WHAT?

00:24.200 --> 00:25.533
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

00:25.533 --> 00:26.967
I TOLD YOU YESTERDAY
I WAS GOING TO PICK OUT

00:26.967 --> 00:28.567
PAINT COLORS
FOR THE BEDROOM TODAY.

00:28.567 --> 00:31.167
- I TOLD YOU I WANTED
TO GO GOLFING.

00:31.167 --> 00:34.267
- YEAH, AND I SAID,
"TOO BAD."

00:36.233 --> 00:39.267
- I THOUGHT THAT MEANT
FOR YOU.

00:40.733 --> 00:42.800
- RAY, I'M GOING
TO THE HARDWARE STORE.

00:42.800 --> 00:45.433
YOU ONLY HAVE TO WATCH THE BOYS
'CAUSE ALLY'S AT MOLLY'S.

00:45.433 --> 00:47.433
- LOOK, I'LL SPEND THE WHOLE
DAY WITH THEM TOMORROW, OKAY?

00:47.433 --> 00:48.833
I PROMISE.
I'LL EVEN--

00:48.833 --> 00:50.900
I'LL SKIP CHURCH, OKAY?

00:50.900 --> 00:52.433
I'LL GIVE MY KIDS
THE TIME

00:52.433 --> 00:56.700
I NORMALLY RESERVE
FOR THE LORD.

00:56.700 --> 00:59.800
- DO YOU WANT TO BE ANY PART
OF THEIR CHILDHOOD MEMORIES?

00:59.800 --> 01:01.500
- "CHILDHOOD MEMORIES."
COME ON.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.267
ASK THEM ABOUT THEIR TRIP
TO DISNEY WORLD.

01:03.267 --> 01:05.167
THEY DON'T EVEN REMEMBER IT.
- THEY WERE THREE.

01:05.167 --> 01:06.633
- [scoffs]

01:06.633 --> 01:08.333
TIGER WOODS COULD HIT
A BALL 200 YARDS

01:08.333 --> 01:11.433
WHEN HE WAS THREE.

01:12.767 --> 01:14.867
- OKAY, RAY, GO AHEAD.

01:14.867 --> 01:16.167
YOU GO GOLFING.

01:16.167 --> 01:17.667
I'LL DRAG THEM AROUND
WITH ME ALL DAY.

01:17.667 --> 01:19.133
I'M SURE THEY'LL HAVE
A WONDERFUL TIME

01:19.133 --> 01:20.833
LOOKING AT PAINT SAMPLES.

01:20.833 --> 01:23.467
- THERE YOU GO.

01:23.467 --> 01:26.067
- YOU PUT
THOSE GOLF CLUBS DOWN,

01:26.067 --> 01:27.533
SPEND SOME TIME
WITH YOUR KIDS,

01:27.533 --> 01:30.667
AND CREATE
SOME DAMN MEMORIES!

01:34.633 --> 01:36.733
- ALL RIGHT!

01:44.267 --> 01:45.500
MAYBE YOU SHOULD WORRY
ABOUT THE MEMORIES

01:45.500 --> 01:48.333
I'M GOING TO HAVE OF YOU.

01:52.400 --> 01:53.667
- YOU KNOW,
YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME

01:53.667 --> 01:55.733
YOU WERE PICKING OUT
PAINT SAMPLES.

01:55.733 --> 01:57.233
I COULD HAVE GONE WITH YOU.

01:57.233 --> 02:00.733
- OH, WHAT WAS I THINKING?

02:00.733 --> 02:02.667
- WELL, NO MATTER.
SIT DOWN, SWEETHEART.

02:02.667 --> 02:04.600
YOU KNOW, WHEN I HEARD
THAT YOU WERE LOOKING

02:04.600 --> 02:06.600
FOR NEW COLORS
FOR THE BEDROOM,

02:06.600 --> 02:10.533
I BROUGHT OVER
MY OWN SAMPLES.

02:10.533 --> 02:14.333
THIS IS
FROM WHEN PAINT WAS GOOD.

02:14.333 --> 02:16.067
- NO, MARIE, I THINK
I ALREADY FOUND

02:16.067 --> 02:17.567
SOMETHING I LIKE.

02:17.567 --> 02:19.133
- YES, BUT YOU HAVE
TO CONSIDER

02:19.133 --> 02:20.533
ALL YOUR OPTIONS.

02:20.533 --> 02:22.267
- THAT'S TRUE THERE,
DEBRA.

02:22.267 --> 02:24.100
YOU GOT TO CHOOSE CAREFULLY
WHEN IT'S SOMETHING

02:33.500 --> 02:38.167
all: [singing]
NA-NA-NA-NA BATMAN

02:39.467 --> 02:42.833
ALL RIGHT, THAT CONCLUDES
OUR SUPER-SPECIAL DADDY DAY.

02:42.833 --> 02:45.000
WHO DO WE LOVE?
both: DADDY!

02:45.000 --> 02:47.933
- THAT'S ME.

02:47.933 --> 02:49.433
- THAT'S GREAT!

02:49.433 --> 02:52.033
- AW, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU BOYS HAD FUN.

02:52.033 --> 02:55.167
- WE WENT
TO DADDY'S GOLF COURSE.

02:57.967 --> 02:59.400
- DADDY'S GOLF COURSE?

02:59.400 --> 03:03.300
- WELL, I PLAYED
LIKE I OWN THE PLACE.

03:03.300 --> 03:05.367
- WHY ARE YOU ALL WET?

03:05.367 --> 03:07.333
- OH, YEAH, I LET THEM
PLAY IN THE SAND TRAP,

03:07.333 --> 03:09.067
AND THEN I HIT SOME BALLS
INTO THE LITTLE CREEK

03:09.067 --> 03:11.967
SO THEY COULD GO GET THEM
AND RINSE OFF.

03:11.967 --> 03:14.133
- YOU WHAT?

03:14.133 --> 03:15.633
- YEAH, IT WAS GREAT.

03:15.633 --> 03:18.233
IT WAS LIKE AN UNDERWATER
EASTER EGG HUNT.

03:18.233 --> 03:19.567
OH, THEY LOVED IT.

03:19.567 --> 03:22.900
- BOYS, GO UPSTAIRS AND CHANGE.
- OKAY.

03:22.900 --> 03:25.100
OH, BOY.

03:25.100 --> 03:27.333
SO WHAT'S SUPER-SPECIAL DADDY
GETTING

03:27.333 --> 03:29.600
FOR SUPER-SPECIAL SUPPER?

03:29.600 --> 03:31.167
- THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
THE KIDS' DAY,

03:31.167 --> 03:33.467
AND YOU DRAGGED THEM
AROUND THE GOLF COURSE?

03:33.467 --> 03:35.167
- WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

03:35.167 --> 03:36.600
THEY HAD A GREAT TIME.

03:36.600 --> 03:38.433
I THOUGHT THE WHOLE POINT
WAS FOR ME AND THE KIDS

03:38.433 --> 03:41.500
TO SPEND SOME TIME TOGETHER
AND HAVE FUN, HUH?

03:41.500 --> 03:43.400
LIKE WHEN DAD
USED TO TAKE ME AND ROBERT

03:43.400 --> 03:45.633
TO THE LODGE
INSTEAD OF THE PLAYGROUND.

03:48.933 --> 03:54.300
- YOU TOOK MY BABIES
TO YOUR DISGUSTING LODGE?

03:54.300 --> 03:55.633
- NEVER HAPPENED.

03:55.633 --> 03:58.767
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

04:01.133 --> 04:03.600
- OH, WHAT?
IT WAS FUN--

04:03.600 --> 04:07.367
COLLECTING BOTTLE CAPS
AND LEARNING HOW TO PLAY POOL.

04:07.367 --> 04:09.467
DAD, REMEMBER
YOU WOULD GET A BEER,

04:09.467 --> 04:12.300
AND YOU'D LET ME AND ROBERT
SUCK THE FOAM OFF THE TOP OF IT?

04:15.300 --> 04:18.800
- YOU LET MY RAYMOND
HAVE BEER?

04:18.800 --> 04:22.433
- MADE A MAN OUT OF HIM...

04:22.433 --> 04:24.367
ALMOST.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.967
- WHAT? NO BIG DEAL.

04:28.967 --> 04:31.500
- THIS IS YOUR DEFENSE,
HIM?

04:33.767 --> 04:35.700
- YEAH.

04:35.700 --> 04:39.533
WE WERE HAPPY
'CAUSE WE WERE WITH OUR DAD.

04:39.533 --> 04:42.267
AND THAT'S WHY THE BOYS
HAD A GOOD TIME.

04:42.267 --> 04:44.133
- DOING WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

04:44.133 --> 04:47.067
- THE BOYS HAD FUN.

04:47.067 --> 04:51.667
TO QUOTE THEM, "YA-HOO."

04:57.200 --> 04:59.567
- THEY DID SEEM HAPPY.

04:59.567 --> 05:03.233
- NEXT TIME,
GIVE THEM SOME BEER.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.367
- I MEAN, LOOK, YOU SAID

05:11.367 --> 05:13.000
YOU SHOULD CREATE
SOME CHILDHOOD MEMORIES.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.333
I THINK WE MADE A WHOLE BUNCH
OF GOOD ONES TODAY.

05:15.333 --> 05:18.267
- I AGREE WITH RAYMOND.

05:20.433 --> 05:22.900
- [sighs]

05:22.900 --> 05:26.833
WELL, YOU KNOW, THEY DID SEEM
LIKE THEY HAD A GOOD TIME.

05:26.833 --> 05:29.833
SO, OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT.

05:29.833 --> 05:31.000
- THANK YOU.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.233
AND I HAD
A GREAT TIME TOO.

05:33.233 --> 05:34.767
- HEY, RAY,
REMEMBER AT THE LODGE

05:34.767 --> 05:36.300
WHEN THE GUYS TRIED TO GET YOU
TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE,

05:36.300 --> 05:39.200
AND YOU SWALLOWED IT?

05:42.900 --> 05:45.700
YOU THREW UP FUNNY.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.067
- OH, BOY.

05:51.067 --> 05:54.167
THOSE KIDS
REALLY WORE ME OUT TODAY.

05:54.167 --> 05:55.600
I'VE PROBABLY GOT
JUST ENOUGH STRENGTH

05:55.600 --> 05:59.067
TO MAKE LOVE,
AND THAT'S IT.

06:06.767 --> 06:09.000
HOW YOU DOING?

06:10.700 --> 06:12.633
- SO YOU REALLY SPENT
THE WHOLE DAY

06:12.633 --> 06:15.967
ON THE GOLF COURSE
WITH THE KIDS?

06:15.967 --> 06:19.300
- WAIT A MINUTE, DIDN'T
I ALREADY WIN THIS ARGUMENT?

06:19.300 --> 06:21.933
- I KNOW,
BUT IT'S JUST--

06:21.933 --> 06:23.733
I DON'T KNOW.

06:23.733 --> 06:26.567
IT SEEMED LIKE YOU HAD
SUCH A GOOD TIME TOGETHER.

06:26.567 --> 06:29.733
- YOU TOLD ME TO.

06:29.733 --> 06:31.700
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT ME?

06:31.700 --> 06:32.967
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

06:32.967 --> 06:34.267
YOU CAN HAVE
A GOOD TIME WITH THEM

06:34.267 --> 06:37.167
EVERY DAY, IF YOU WANT.
DO IT TOMORROW.

06:37.167 --> 06:40.367
I CAN GO GOLFING
WITHOUT THE NOISE, YOU KNOW.

06:40.367 --> 06:41.667
I DIDN'T WANT
TO SAY ANYTHING,

06:41.667 --> 06:44.533
BUT THEY COST ME,
LIKE, FOUR STROKES.

06:44.533 --> 06:48.100
- NOT ME AND THEM,
ME AND YOU.

06:48.100 --> 06:49.667
- WHAT?

06:49.667 --> 06:52.533
- I MEAN, YOU CAN HAVE SUCH
A FUN TIME WITH THE KIDS.

06:52.533 --> 06:54.600
WHY CAN'T YOU
HAVE FUN WITH ME?

06:54.600 --> 06:57.667
- I WAS JUST TRYING
TO HAVE FUN WITH YOU.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.700
- YOU WERE TRYING
TO HAVE SEX WITH ME.

06:59.700 --> 07:01.533
- SEX IS FUN.

07:01.533 --> 07:05.233
ESPECIALLY WITH ME
'CAUSE I WHISTLE.

07:07.833 --> 07:09.667
- DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE
BOYFRIEND AND GIRLFRIEND?

07:09.667 --> 07:12.533
WE USED TO GO
TO CONCERTS AND BOWLING,

07:12.533 --> 07:14.967
BASEBALL GAMES,
EVERYTHING.

07:14.967 --> 07:16.333
WE USED TO HAVE FUN.

07:16.333 --> 07:17.767
- WELL, LOOK,
I DIDN'T KNOW

07:17.767 --> 07:19.400
THAT YOU WERE STILL
INTERESTED IN HAVING FUN.

07:19.400 --> 07:22.167
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
OF COURSE I AM.

07:22.167 --> 07:23.600
- WELL, ALL RIGHT,
BUT THEN, YOU KNOW,

07:23.600 --> 07:25.133
BUT YOU GOT TO TELL ME.
I'M NOT A MIND READER.

07:25.133 --> 07:26.733
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:26.733 --> 07:29.800
I AM TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW,
I WANT TO HAVE FUN WITH YOU.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.467
- OKAY--
- NONSEXUAL FUN.

07:32.467 --> 07:34.700
- BUT WHERE
IS THIS COMING FROM?

07:34.700 --> 07:36.333
WERE YOU READING
ONE OF THOSE MAGAZINES

07:36.333 --> 07:39.267
IN THE BEAUTY PARLOR?
- NO, RAY.

07:39.267 --> 07:42.267
BUT I DID HAPPEN
TO GET A POSTCARD

07:42.267 --> 07:43.867
FROM AMY AND ROBERT TODAY.

07:43.867 --> 07:48.067
- OH, AMY AND ROBERT!

07:48.067 --> 07:50.333
"OH, WE'RE IN ITALY.

07:50.333 --> 07:52.333
"LET'S SHARE A PIECE
OF SPAGHETTI TOGETHER,

07:52.333 --> 07:55.900
AND THEN WE CAN SLURP IT
TILL WE MEET IN THE MIDDLE."

07:55.900 --> 07:58.800
- "WE'RE HAVING
SUCH A GREAT TIME TOGETHER.

07:58.800 --> 08:01.233
IT'S ABSOLUTELY MAGICAL."

08:01.233 --> 08:03.433
- THEY'RE ON
THEIR HONEYMOON!

08:03.433 --> 08:07.433
GUESS WHAT THEY'RE DOING
A LOT OF.

08:07.433 --> 08:09.100
- IT'S NOT JUST THAT.

08:09.100 --> 08:10.533
THEY ENJOY EACH OTHER.

08:10.533 --> 08:12.367
THEY ENJOY
EACH OTHER'S COMPANY.

08:12.367 --> 08:14.000
THEY ENJOY BEING TOGETHER.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.133
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT THAT WAS LIKE?

08:16.133 --> 08:19.367
- WELL--
SO WHAT?

08:19.367 --> 08:21.867
WHAT, DO YOU WANT TO HAVE,
LIKE, A PICNIC OR SOMETHING?

08:21.867 --> 08:22.933
- NO.

08:22.933 --> 08:25.167
YOU KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING?

08:25.167 --> 08:27.567
WHY DON'T WE GO GOLFING
TOGETHER?

08:31.867 --> 08:33.400
COME ON, RAY.

08:33.400 --> 08:36.033
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
YOU LOVE GOLF,

08:36.033 --> 08:37.967
AND I WANT TO BE
A PART OF THAT.

08:37.967 --> 08:39.767
IT COULD BE FUN.
YOU COULD TEACH ME.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.233
COME ON, RAY, I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
GOLF IS YOUR THING.

08:48.233 --> 08:49.633
YOU READ ABOUT IT.
YOU WATCH IT.

08:49.633 --> 08:52.400
YOU WEAR
YOUR NICEST CLOTHES TO IT.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.867
I WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT.

08:53.867 --> 08:59.500
- LISTEN, GOLF--
GOLF, IT'S A FRUSTRATING GAME.

08:59.500 --> 09:00.533
ALL RIGHT?

09:00.533 --> 09:02.300
AND IT'S REALLY HOT
OUT THERE.

09:02.300 --> 09:06.300
AND--AND IF THERE'S LIGHTNING,
YOU COULD BE KILLED.

09:19.033 --> 09:21.933
ALL RIGHT.

09:21.933 --> 09:24.267
LISTEN.

09:24.267 --> 09:28.067
IF--IF YOU WANT
TO GO GOLFING...

09:40.700 --> 09:43.633
WE'LL GO.

09:48.533 --> 09:52.467
BECAUSE YOU'RE
MY GIRLFRIEND.

09:52.467 --> 09:55.400
- YEAH?
- YEAH. YEAH.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.233
- AW.
- AND IF THERE'S LIGHTNING,

09:57.233 --> 10:00.433
I'LL STEP IN FRONT OF YOU
AND TAKE IT IN THE HEAD.

10:10.700 --> 10:13.000
- THERE YOU ARE.
- HEY.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.500
- I WAS JUST
IN THE GIFT SHOP.

10:14.500 --> 10:16.267
YOU DIDN'T PAR OFF
WITHOUT ME, DID YOU?

10:16.267 --> 10:19.433
- NO, NO.
NO, I DIDN'T.

10:19.433 --> 10:20.900
I DIDN'T TEE OFF--
TEE OFF.

10:20.900 --> 10:21.900
- RIGHT.
- YEAH.

10:21.900 --> 10:24.733
- LOOK, I GOT US VISORS.

10:24.733 --> 10:26.333
- HEY, HEY!
- RIGHT?

10:26.333 --> 10:28.800
- GREAT, YEAH.
HEY, THEY MATCH, RIGHT?

10:28.800 --> 10:32.067
"I LOVE BIRDIES."
- YEAH.

10:32.067 --> 10:34.400
I MEAN, I KNOW IT DOESN'T
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH GOLF,

10:34.400 --> 10:37.100
BUT I JUST THOUGHT
THEY WERE CUTE.

10:38.900 --> 10:40.633
OKAY, RAY, I AM READY.

10:40.633 --> 10:41.800
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

10:41.800 --> 10:44.167
- ALL RIGHT.
WHY DON'T I TEE OFF FIRST?

10:44.167 --> 10:45.967
AND THEN, HERE,
THEN WE'LL GET YOU GOING.

10:45.967 --> 10:49.100
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT?

10:51.100 --> 10:54.233
- WAIT. YOU'RE NOT
WEARING YOUR VISOR.

10:56.067 --> 10:58.733
- [chuckles]
ALL RIGHT.

11:00.500 --> 11:01.967
- YEAH.

11:01.967 --> 11:05.100
NOW WE LOOK
LIKE TEAMMATES. WHOO!

11:19.633 --> 11:23.233
OH, MY GOSH, RAY,
THAT WAS GREAT!

11:23.233 --> 11:27.033
- YEAH, THAT'LL WORK.

11:27.033 --> 11:29.700
- NO, REALLY, RAY,
THAT WAS AWESOME.

11:29.700 --> 11:31.333
I HAD NO IDEA
YOU WERE SO GOOD.

11:31.333 --> 11:34.700
MY GOSH, YOU WERE LIKE
ONE OF THOSE PROS ON TV.

11:34.700 --> 11:36.667
- NO.

11:36.667 --> 11:38.967
YEAH?
- YEAH!

11:38.967 --> 11:40.533
WOW!

11:40.533 --> 11:44.433
- WELL, YOU KNOW, I GOT MY HIPS
THROUGH ON THAT ONE. YEAH.

11:44.433 --> 11:45.967
- GO ON,
HIT ANOTHER ONE.

11:45.967 --> 11:47.433
- NO, DON'T WORRY.

11:47.433 --> 11:51.100
THERE'LL BE PLENTY MORE TIMES
TO AMAZE YOU.

11:51.100 --> 11:52.800
HERE, GO AHEAD.
- OH, BOY.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.433
- I'LL SET YOU UP HERE.

11:54.433 --> 11:57.200
- OKAY.
- YEAH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

11:57.200 --> 11:59.000
GO AHEAD.
- OKAY.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.733
- YEP. RELAX.

12:01.733 --> 12:04.033
ALL RIGHT, WELL--

12:04.033 --> 12:06.133
ALL RIGHT, I'LL HELP YOU.

12:06.133 --> 12:08.600
JUST, UM--

12:08.600 --> 12:10.800
[laughs]
- WHAT?

12:10.800 --> 12:12.633
- NO, IT'S JUST,
THIS IS A LOT BETTER

12:12.633 --> 12:17.700
THAN WHEN I SHOWED ROBERT.
- OH. [chuckles]

12:17.700 --> 12:20.767
- ALL RIGHT, SO--
YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.

12:20.767 --> 12:22.000
WELL, THE GRIP--
HERE.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.233
FIRST, THIS HAND GOES UP HERE...
- OKAY.

12:23.233 --> 12:24.633
- AND THE RIGHT HAND ON TOP.
- YES.

12:24.633 --> 12:27.367
- THEN KIND OF INTERLOCK
THE PINKY THERE.

12:27.367 --> 12:29.400
- I GOT IT.
- OKAY, NOW JUST WATCH IT,

12:29.400 --> 12:33.333
AND JUST TAKE IT BACK
NICE AND SLOW,

12:33.333 --> 12:36.467
AND THEN
JUST SWING THROUGH.

12:42.533 --> 12:44.233
- OH, I HIT IT!

12:44.233 --> 12:45.867
I HIT THAT BALL,
THAT LITTLE BALL!

12:45.867 --> 12:47.733
- THAT'S--THAT'S--

12:47.733 --> 12:49.700
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NOT BAD.

12:49.700 --> 12:51.033
THAT'S VERY GOOD.

12:51.033 --> 12:53.967
- REALLY? YEAH?
- REALLY. YEAH.

12:53.967 --> 12:56.100
[chuckles]

13:09.800 --> 13:11.467
- SORRY, GUYS.
- OH, HEY.

13:11.467 --> 13:13.833
- WE'LL GET OUT OF YOUR WAY.
- YEAH, SORRY.

13:13.833 --> 13:16.033
ALL RIGHT.

13:16.033 --> 13:17.200
HEY, GUYS,
IF MY WIFE CALLS,

13:17.200 --> 13:18.700
TELL HER
I'M WITH MY GIRLFRIEND.

13:18.700 --> 13:20.700
- OH! STOP.

13:23.367 --> 13:24.700
- ALL RIGHT,
THIS IS GREAT.

13:24.700 --> 13:26.433
YOU GOT A CHANCE
TO BREAK TEN ON THIS HOLE.

13:26.433 --> 13:28.133
- YEAH.

13:28.133 --> 13:29.533
OKAY, SHOW ME AGAIN.

13:29.533 --> 13:31.133
- OKAY, JUST--

13:31.133 --> 13:33.433
YOU JUST PUT YOUR THUMBS
ON TOP OF THE GRIP.

13:33.433 --> 13:35.700
- RIGHT, AND PALMS
FACING EACH OTHER.

13:35.700 --> 13:37.667
- RIGHT.

13:42.900 --> 13:44.667
- OH! [laughs]
YEAH!

13:44.667 --> 13:47.433
- SEE? SEE,
YOU'RE A GREAT PUTTER.

13:49.500 --> 13:51.000
- OKAY.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.133
OKAY, HONEY, SLICE IT IN.

13:58.933 --> 14:02.067
- OH, YOU GOT TO HIT IT,
YOU IDIOT!

14:05.767 --> 14:07.700
- UM, YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:10.767 --> 14:12.333
- WHAT?

14:12.333 --> 14:14.100
- NOTHING, IT'S JUST
I NOTICED THAT YOUR THUMBS

14:14.100 --> 14:16.600
AREN'T REALLY
ON TOP OF YOUR GRIP.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.433
- OH, YEAH.
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:19.433 --> 14:22.067
[chuckles]
OKAY.

14:22.067 --> 14:24.167
- VERY GOOD SHOT, HONEY.

14:24.167 --> 14:27.133
- YEAH, A BOGEY.

14:27.133 --> 14:28.533
- ARE YOU OKAY?

14:28.533 --> 14:30.233
YOU DIDN'T MIND ME
CORRECTING YOU, DID YOU?

14:30.233 --> 14:31.867
- NO, NO, NOT AT ALL.

14:31.867 --> 14:33.333
I LOVE IT AT HOME.

14:33.333 --> 14:36.467
WHY WOULDN'T I LOVE IT
ON THE GOLF COURSE?

14:38.033 --> 14:39.600
THAT'S A--
I'M JOKING.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.767
GOLFERS, THEY ZING
EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME.

14:41.767 --> 14:45.100
THEY ZING-ZING!

14:45.100 --> 14:48.233
COME ON, NEXT HOLE.
- OKAY.

14:53.367 --> 14:54.833
- POSTURE, POSTURE, POSTURE.

14:54.833 --> 14:57.267
- I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.

14:58.267 --> 14:59.867
- HOLD ON. HOLD ON.

14:59.867 --> 15:01.400
YOU JUST, UH--

15:01.400 --> 15:03.267
YOU'RE A LITTLE
TOO BENT OVER.

15:03.267 --> 15:04.733
- YOU KNOW WHAT, RAY?
LET ME JUST

15:04.733 --> 15:08.833
DO THIS ONE MYSELF.
I JUST NEED A LITTLE SPACE.

15:08.833 --> 15:10.767
- OKAY.

15:13.867 --> 15:16.000
- OKAY.

15:17.467 --> 15:20.433
HERE I GO.

15:25.500 --> 15:26.467
WOW! WOW!

15:26.467 --> 15:27.967
DID YOU SEE
HOW FAR THAT WENT?

15:27.967 --> 15:30.467
IT LANDED ON THE SMOOTH PART!

15:30.467 --> 15:32.400
RAY?

15:38.000 --> 15:39.933
- WHAT?

15:39.933 --> 15:41.100
- YOU WEREN'T WATCHING?

15:41.100 --> 15:45.000
- I-I WAS ADJUSTING
MY VISOR.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.533
- YOU KNOW, I WATCH
ALL YOUR SHOTS.

15:46.533 --> 15:48.233
WOULD IT KILL YOU
TO WATCH MINE?

15:48.233 --> 15:50.567
- SORRY, YOU SHOULD
HAVE SAID SOMETHING.

15:50.567 --> 15:52.867
- I DID.
I SAID, "HERE I GO."

15:52.867 --> 15:55.100
- YOU DID?
- YES.

15:55.100 --> 15:56.600
YOU DON'T LISTEN
TO ME AT HOME,

15:56.600 --> 16:00.700
SO WHY SHOULD YOU LISTEN TO ME
ON THE GOLF COURSE?

16:00.700 --> 16:03.633
ZING-ZING.

16:12.300 --> 16:14.100
- CAN YOU BACK UP
A COUPLE FEET?

16:14.100 --> 16:15.933
- WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

16:15.933 --> 16:20.100
- YOUR SHADOW
IS IN MY WAY.

16:20.100 --> 16:21.633
- WHAT?

16:21.633 --> 16:24.133
- IT'S--IT'S RIGHT
IN FRONT OF THE HOLE.

16:24.133 --> 16:27.667
- AND MY SHADOW'S
GOING TO STOP YOUR BALL?

16:27.667 --> 16:29.733
- NO, IT'S--
IT'S JUST--

16:29.733 --> 16:32.467
LOOK, COULD YOU JUST
BACK UP A COUPLE STEPS?

16:40.967 --> 16:44.000
DAMN IT!

16:44.000 --> 16:48.933
- THE BALL BARELY EVEN MADE IT
TO WHERE MY SHADOW WAS.

16:48.933 --> 16:50.767
- 'CAUSE YOU GOT ME ALL NUTS.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.133
[sighs]

16:56.133 --> 16:58.800
CAN'T EVEN MAKE
A FRICKIN' PUTT!

16:58.800 --> 17:02.400
- I DON'T THINK
IT'S YOUR PUTTER'S FAULT, RAY.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.500
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S NOT THE PUTTER.

17:04.500 --> 17:05.533
- WHAT?

17:11.967 --> 17:14.100
- IT'S YOU.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.600
- EXCUSE ME?

17:17.600 --> 17:19.433
- YOU KNOW,
WHEN WE STARTED TODAY,

17:19.433 --> 17:22.300
YOU WERE ALL, "OH, OH, OH,
YOU'RE GREAT, RAY.

17:22.300 --> 17:24.267
OH, YOU'RE LIKE A PRO, RAY."

17:24.267 --> 17:25.600
- YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE NOT
EXACTLY THE SAME GUY

17:25.600 --> 17:26.667
I TEED OFF WITH EITHER.

17:26.667 --> 17:28.467
YOU WENT FROM HUGGING
AND KISSING ME

17:28.467 --> 17:30.967
TO NOT WANTING TO HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH ME OR MY SHADOW.

17:30.967 --> 17:33.433
- I-I STOPPED HUGGING YOU

17:33.433 --> 17:35.967
WHEN YOU STARTED YELLING,
"I NEED MY SPACE," HUH?

17:35.967 --> 17:38.033
WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL
THE BOYFRIEND-GIRLFRIEND CRAP?

17:38.033 --> 17:39.167
- BOYFRIENDS ARE SUPPOSED
TO PAY ATTENTION

17:39.167 --> 17:40.467
TO THEIR GIRLFRIENDS.

17:40.467 --> 17:44.667
- YEAH?
WELL, WE'RE MARRIED NOW.

17:44.667 --> 17:46.700
- YOU'RE STILL SUPPOSED
TO WANT TO BE WITH ME.

17:46.700 --> 17:48.933
YOU'RE STILL SUPPOSED
TO LISTEN TO ME.

17:48.933 --> 17:51.133
- OH, GOD, LOOK, I'M SORRY
THAT I MISSED YOUR SHOT.

17:51.133 --> 17:52.567
- IT'S NOT ABOUT THE SHOT!

17:52.567 --> 17:54.433
- WELL, THEN WHY'D
YOU BRING IT UP, HUH?

17:54.433 --> 17:56.433
GOLFING--WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE FUN HERE!

17:56.433 --> 17:57.733
AND YOU KNOW--
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:57.733 --> 17:58.967
I ALWAYS DO HAVE FUN
WHEN I COME HERE,

17:58.967 --> 18:00.533
BUT NOT TODAY.

18:00.533 --> 18:03.600
HMM, I WONDER WHAT'S
DIFFERENT ABOUT TODAY, HMM.

18:05.367 --> 18:06.933
- WHAT'S DIFFERENT
ABOUT TODAY IS

18:06.933 --> 18:08.533
THAT I MADE A BIG EFFORT
TO DO SOMETHING

18:08.533 --> 18:10.467
YOU LOVE,
SO WE COULD BE TOGETHER.

18:10.467 --> 18:13.067
- THAT'S NOT WHY YOU DID IT.
- YES, IT IS!

18:13.067 --> 18:14.467
- NO, I THINK YOU DID IT,

18:14.467 --> 18:15.900
SO IT WOULD RUIN WHAT I LOVE,

18:15.900 --> 18:17.133
SO I DON'T LOVE IT ANYMORE.

18:17.133 --> 18:19.533
- WHAT?
- YES, THAT'S RIGHT!

18:19.533 --> 18:21.733
RIGHT, SO ALL I WOULD
WANT TO DO IS STAY HOME

18:21.733 --> 18:24.200
AND LISTEN TO YOU ALL DAY,
AND THEN WHEN YOU SLEEP,

18:24.200 --> 18:27.933
I SHOULD TAKE OUT A PAD
AND SKETCH YOU!

18:27.933 --> 18:30.933
- HOW DARE YOU SAY I CAME HERE
TO RUIN GOLF FOR YOU?

18:30.933 --> 18:32.900
- WELL, THEN WHY'D YOU COME?
- FORGET IT, RAY.

18:32.900 --> 18:35.267
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT YOU
DON'T EVEN WANT ME HERE.

18:35.267 --> 18:37.767
- WELL, MAYBE I DON'T.
MAYBE I NEED MY SPACE TOO!

18:42.000 --> 18:43.733
- YOU'RE RIGHT, RAY.

18:43.733 --> 18:45.200
YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.333
BUT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE
IT WOULD HELP YOUR ARGUMENT

18:47.333 --> 18:49.700
IF WE WERE EVEN A LITTLE BIT
CONNECTED AT HOME.

18:49.700 --> 18:51.700
BUT IT DOESN'T
HAPPEN THERE EITHER.

18:51.700 --> 18:53.933
MAYBE I DO WANT
WHAT AMY AND ROBERT HAVE.

18:53.933 --> 18:57.967
MAYBE I DO WANT
WHAT WE HAD.

18:57.967 --> 19:01.633
BUT I SHOULDN'T
HAVE COME HERE.

19:01.633 --> 19:03.567
SORRY.

19:42.533 --> 19:44.333
- I'M SORRY.

19:44.333 --> 19:47.200
I'M SORRY.
I'M GOING TO--

19:47.200 --> 19:48.500
I'M GOING TO WORK
ON ALL THOSE THINGS

19:48.500 --> 19:51.633
THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT.

19:56.600 --> 20:00.067
I WANT TO HAVE FUN
WITH YOU TOO.

20:00.067 --> 20:02.767
I LIKE BEING WITH YOU.

20:02.767 --> 20:06.433
I JUST--YOU KNOW,
I GUESS IT'S--

20:06.433 --> 20:07.833
IT'S EASY TO FORGET

20:07.833 --> 20:11.333
AFTER YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED
FOR 12 YEARS.

20:12.433 --> 20:14.200
- 13.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.100
- I GUESS IT JUST
FEELS LIKE 12

20:18.100 --> 20:22.100
BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MUCH FUN.

20:25.133 --> 20:26.467
COME ON, LET'S--
LET'S FINISH.

20:26.467 --> 20:28.033
WE'VE GOT
A COUPLE MORE HOLES.

20:28.033 --> 20:30.133
- YOU KNOW,
I THINK I HAD ENOUGH.

20:30.133 --> 20:32.100
- NO, BUT YOU'RE DOING GOOD,
YOU KNOW?

20:32.100 --> 20:34.600
ALL YOU GOT TO DO
IS JUST KEEP TRYING.

20:34.600 --> 20:37.533
- THANKS, RAY,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:37.533 --> 20:39.467
[sighs]

20:39.467 --> 20:42.133
I HATE GOLF.

20:42.133 --> 20:44.267
- REALLY?
- [whispers] YEAH.

20:46.800 --> 20:49.567
- YOU'RE NOT JUST SAYING THAT
TO MAKE ME FEEL GOOD, ARE YOU?

20:59.600 --> 21:04.000
I GOT TO SAY, THIS PART--
A LITTLE BETTER WITH ROBERT.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.133
ZING-ZING!
- OH, YEAH.

21:12.500 --> 21:13.633
- HEY.

21:13.633 --> 21:15.033
all: HI.

21:15.033 --> 21:16.300
- SORRY WE'RE LATE.

21:16.300 --> 21:18.033
THE KIDS GIVE YOU
ANY TROUBLE?

21:18.033 --> 21:19.567
- JUST THE BIG, UGLY ONE.

21:25.767 --> 21:28.533
HOW WAS YOUR GOLF DATE?
- IT WAS REALLY NICE.

21:28.533 --> 21:29.933
- YEAH.

21:29.933 --> 21:33.000
BOY, THAT'S THE MOST FUN
WE'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.333
- WELL,
THEN YOU REALLY RECOMMEND

21:34.333 --> 21:36.233
THIS SPENDING
THE DAY TOGETHER?

21:36.233 --> 21:37.567
- ABSOLUTELY.

21:37.567 --> 21:40.033
MAKES YOU FEEL YOUNG.
- YEAH.

21:40.033 --> 21:42.267
- OH, I'M SO JEALOUS.

21:42.267 --> 21:43.933
FRANK, I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU SAY.

21:43.933 --> 21:47.467
TOMORROW I'M SPENDING
THE DAY WITH RAYMOND.
