        Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

00:04.537 --> 00:06.739
             Woody.             

00:07.974 --> 00:09.641
I hear that you and Kelly       

00:09.709 --> 00:12.011
are having a hard time          
getting a wedding ring.         

00:12.078 --> 00:13.345
      That's right, Carla.      

00:13.413 --> 00:14.713
They're pretty expensive,       
        you know.               

00:14.781 --> 00:16.114
Yeah. That's                    
what I thought.                 

00:16.181 --> 00:18.717
And you know, I'm not           
gonna be able to afford         

00:18.785 --> 00:20.986
to get you kids the kind        
of present you really deserve,  

00:21.054 --> 00:22.788
so, on the way                  
over here                       

00:22.856 --> 00:26.025
I stopped by my bank,           
and, uh,                        

00:26.092 --> 00:28.494
I took this out                 
of my safety deposit box.       

00:28.561 --> 00:30.529
      Oh, Carla, that's a beaut!

00:30.597 --> 00:32.164
Yeah, I know.                   

00:32.232 --> 00:33.332
It's solid silver.              

00:33.400 --> 00:35.100
It's been in my family          
for years.                      

00:35.168 --> 00:37.603
My great uncle Amerigo          

00:37.671 --> 00:39.438
gave it to my                   
great aunt Sophia,              

00:39.506 --> 00:42.307
and then I was gonna give it    
to my youngest girl,            

00:42.375 --> 00:46.045
but she inherited               
the Tortelli knuckles.          

00:46.112 --> 00:47.980
              Oh, Carla, I could
                  never take it.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.282
Oh, Woody,                      
I-I want you to have it.        

00:50.350 --> 00:52.518
        Well, at least let me   
      give you something for it.

00:52.585 --> 00:53.886
    I have $500 in my budget.   

00:53.953 --> 00:56.989
Well, if it makes you           
feel better.                    

00:57.057 --> 00:59.058
                 Well, you know,
                the thing is,   

00:59.125 --> 01:01.527
                uh, Kelly really
                prefers gold.   

01:01.594 --> 01:02.928
        Oh.                     

01:02.996 --> 01:05.364
Well, I got it                  
in gold, too.                   

01:05.432 --> 01:07.700
                    Perfect.    

01:07.767 --> 01:09.635
Hey, does she need              
any earrings?

02:24.344 --> 02:26.412
     Afternoon, everybody.      

02:26.479 --> 02:28.147
                            ALL:
                        Norm!   

02:28.214 --> 02:29.782
          Oh, hey, Mr. Peterson,
         that's quite a haircut.

02:29.849 --> 02:32.084
    Yeah, well, they're only    
      halfway done, Woody.      

02:34.487 --> 02:35.821
    I got a little thirsty.     

02:35.889 --> 02:37.823
     You know what I mean?      

02:37.891 --> 02:39.591
        Give me a beer.         

02:40.927 --> 02:42.961
        Hi, Woody.              

02:43.029 --> 02:44.830
        Oh, hey, Kelly.         
    What are you doing here?    

02:44.898 --> 02:46.331
                     I wanted to
             spend the afternoon

02:46.466 --> 02:48.133
    with Mr. Peterson           
        and Mr. Clavin.         

02:48.201 --> 02:49.935
Boy, you've been spending       
         a lot of time          

02:50.003 --> 02:51.103
  with them lately. What's up?  

02:51.171 --> 02:52.404
              I thought it would
                  be a good idea

02:52.472 --> 02:53.672
                for me to get to
              know your friends.

02:53.740 --> 02:54.873
Why?                            

02:54.941 --> 02:56.108
                    Because when
                 we get married,

02:56.176 --> 02:58.177
              and you turn to me
                and say, "Kelly,

02:58.244 --> 02:59.878
            I'm gonna spend a   
             night on the town,"

02:59.946 --> 03:01.547
                and I burst into
            tears and ask you   

03:01.614 --> 03:03.248
            to spend just one   
              night at home, and

03:03.316 --> 03:05.317
             you say, "I'm gonna
            be with my friends,"

03:05.385 --> 03:08.787
            well, I want to know
          who those friends are.

03:08.855 --> 03:12.458
Boy, could I sing               
a couple bars of that.          

03:12.525 --> 03:14.460
So, what do you guys            
talk about?                     

03:14.527 --> 03:15.894
                  Oh, the usual.

03:15.962 --> 03:18.097
                 How the Celtics
             need a point guard,

03:18.164 --> 03:19.732
          the Sox need pitching,

03:19.799 --> 03:22.201
        the fact that there's an
      exact replica of the earth

03:22.268 --> 03:25.170
        on the other side of the
      sun that we can never see.

03:25.238 --> 03:26.939
Wow. Really?                    

03:27.007 --> 03:28.474
The Sox need pitchers?          

03:28.541 --> 03:30.843
            Well, on this earth.

03:30.910 --> 03:32.277
            Anyway, Woody, if   
        you'll excuse me now,   

03:32.345 --> 03:34.546
    one of your friends is gonna
      teach me how to play pool.

03:34.614 --> 03:35.814
Oh, which one?                  

03:35.882 --> 03:37.316
                I don't remember
                his name, but   

03:37.384 --> 03:40.786
    he's the man from the CIA   
    who trains the Green Berets.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.821
  Let's go, tootsie. We're up.  

03:45.959 --> 03:47.893
         Do you realize         
    it's been 18 years          

03:47.994 --> 03:49.928
  since we've seen each other?  

03:49.996 --> 03:51.964
     Me, too. I can't wait.     

03:52.032 --> 03:53.232
         Okay. Bye-bye.         

03:53.299 --> 03:55.534
              You'll never guess
                who that was.   

03:55.602 --> 03:58.904
Your dental hygienist?          

03:58.972 --> 04:02.441
                     Come on. Be
                 serious. Guess.

04:02.509 --> 04:04.376
Okay, I'll be serious.          

04:04.444 --> 04:05.577
I don't really care.            

04:05.645 --> 04:06.979
                        (scoffs)

04:07.047 --> 04:08.547
Well, I'm gonna tell you anyway.

04:08.615 --> 04:09.748
     It was Mark Newberger.     

04:09.816 --> 04:12.251
We have not seen each other     
since graduation night.         

04:12.318 --> 04:14.153
Oh, Mark Newberger.             

04:14.220 --> 04:17.089
We met doing <i>The Bad Seed</i>       
  in our sophomore production.  

04:17.156 --> 04:19.358
He was my first boyfriend.      

04:19.426 --> 04:21.694
      I really loved him.       

04:21.761 --> 04:24.063
Maybe he was the <i>only</i> guy       
I've ever really loved.         

04:24.130 --> 04:25.998
I don't know                    
why I gave him up.              

04:26.066 --> 04:29.134
Oh, I guess I wanted to go off  
to college and be free,         

04:29.202 --> 04:30.269
        that whole deal.        

04:30.337 --> 04:31.370
                I don't know.   
                  What an idiot.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.372
                Why would I ever
                    give him up?

04:33.440 --> 04:36.408
Nobody's listening              
to you.                         

04:36.476 --> 04:39.945
     I am trying to pretend     
  like I have a friend, okay?   

04:40.013 --> 04:41.246
         Wait. What am I saying?

04:41.314 --> 04:43.482
        I do have a friend. I   
          don't need to pretend.

04:43.550 --> 04:44.717
         Mark Newberger is back,

04:44.784 --> 04:46.552
            and he's better than
            any friend <i>you</i> have!

04:46.619 --> 04:47.753
I'm sorry.                      

04:47.821 --> 04:49.388
I wasn't listening.             

04:51.624 --> 04:53.726
                 Anybody in here
                  know this guy?

04:53.793 --> 04:56.095
Sam! My God, what's the matter? 

04:56.162 --> 04:57.663
        We found him out        
  in the middle of the street   

04:57.731 --> 04:58.964
      staring at an empty       
         parking space,         

04:59.032 --> 05:01.200
     muttering to himself,      
      shouting at people.       

05:01.267 --> 05:02.568
SAM:                            
My corvette!                    

05:02.635 --> 05:04.470
They stole my 'Vette!           

05:04.537 --> 05:06.438
Frasier, have you seen          
my 'Vette?                      

05:06.506 --> 05:09.241
                    Oh, Sam, I'm
                     afraid not.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.543
Well, Sam, stop by              
the station house sometime      

05:11.611 --> 05:13.112
and fill out                    
a report.                       

05:13.179 --> 05:14.713
Then you'll give me             
my 'Vette back!                 

05:14.781 --> 05:16.148
Whatever you say.               

05:16.316 --> 05:18.150
            Oh, God.            

05:18.218 --> 05:19.451
I left it outside!              

05:19.519 --> 05:20.753
What was I thinking?            

05:20.820 --> 05:22.488
I should have                   
stayed with it!                 

05:22.555 --> 05:24.356
Boy, oh, boy,                   
oh, boy, Normie,                

05:24.424 --> 05:26.492
I'm gonna miss that car.        

05:26.559 --> 05:28.260
Here, take a look at that.      

05:28.328 --> 05:31.397
            Wow. That's you next
              to Sammy's 'Vette.

05:31.464 --> 05:32.765
    Yeah.                       

05:32.832 --> 05:36.735
Truth be told, I, uh...         
I tell the ladies it's mine.    

05:36.803 --> 05:38.037
Yeah.                           

05:38.104 --> 05:40.673
                Wait. That's not
                 even your body.

05:40.740 --> 05:45.444
          It's Sammy's body with
         your head superimposed.

05:45.512 --> 05:48.447
Yeah, you'd be surprised        
what Ma can do in a darkroom.   

05:48.515 --> 05:52.151
Yeah. Yeah, we got one of, uh,  
me at the Yalta conference.     

05:52.218 --> 05:54.219
    Yeah.                       

05:54.287 --> 05:57.656
You-You should see the look     
that Churchill's giving me.     

05:57.724 --> 06:01.126
          Oh. Oh. Oh!           

06:01.194 --> 06:04.530
    I suppose one of us ought to
     go over and cheer Sammy up.

06:04.597 --> 06:05.698
Uh, yeah, yeah.                 

06:05.765 --> 06:07.266
Well, I'll do it.               
I, uh...                        

06:07.334 --> 06:09.368
I got a flair                   
for this kind of thing.         

06:09.436 --> 06:11.470
You just, uh, stay there        
and drink your beer.            

06:11.538 --> 06:14.540
Okay. We all have to play       
to our strengths, I guess.      

06:14.607 --> 06:15.674
                 Oh, Sammy.     

06:15.742 --> 06:17.543
              Sammy, Sam, Sammy.

06:17.610 --> 06:19.978
        Gee, you know, I, uh,   
    heard about the bad news.   

06:20.046 --> 06:21.180
          I'm really sorry, pal.

06:21.247 --> 06:22.581
              It's, uh, terrible
             what these guys do.

06:22.649 --> 06:24.683
             You know, they, uh,
             just pluck your car

06:24.751 --> 06:26.652
                right up off the
              street and take it

06:26.720 --> 06:28.821
         to what's, uh, commonly
        known as a chop shop.   

06:28.888 --> 06:30.456
                Yeah, where they

06:30.523 --> 06:32.658
 unceremoniously dismantle it,  
        and after that,         

06:32.726 --> 06:35.361
        the felons take         
  an acetylene torch, and, uh,  

06:35.428 --> 06:37.363
            just methodically   
                cut the frame   

06:37.430 --> 06:40.499
                    into little,
                    tiny pieces.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.901
Cliff, do you really think      
    any of this helps?          

06:42.969 --> 06:45.371
  Well, it sure as heck keeps   
the car from being traced, Sam. 

06:48.842 --> 06:51.076
         (raspy voice):         
            Uh, hi.             

06:51.144 --> 06:52.244
I'm looking                     
for Rebecca Howe.               

06:52.312 --> 06:53.479
            She's over there.   

06:54.514 --> 06:56.782
                  Rebecca?      

06:56.850 --> 06:58.851
        My God, Rebecca,        
    you're beautiful!           

06:58.918 --> 07:01.220
Who'd have ever thought         

07:01.287 --> 07:03.355
  that you would've developed   
 into this gorgeous creature?!  

07:03.423 --> 07:05.391
No, Mark!                       
Over here!                      

07:05.458 --> 07:08.193
            Rebecca, you haven't
                  changed a bit!

07:09.262 --> 07:11.163
                    My God, look
                at that hair!   

07:11.231 --> 07:12.731
            If you had any more,

07:12.799 --> 07:14.900
          I could get you listed
    as an endangered species!   

07:14.968 --> 07:16.735
             Well, come on, turn
            around, turn around.

07:16.803 --> 07:18.303
                     Let me see.
                     Let me see.

07:18.371 --> 07:20.406
                  Oh, I like it.
                More to love.   

07:20.473 --> 07:22.041
Me? What about you?!            

07:22.108 --> 07:23.876
             Hey, I'm bulking up
            for the Olympics.   

07:23.943 --> 07:25.844
        (laughs)                
                    You'll never
                     guess what.

07:25.912 --> 07:27.413
      I finally gave up smoking.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.848
Oh, I can tell. Your voice      
sounds so much better.          

07:29.916 --> 07:31.183
Sam?                            

07:31.251 --> 07:32.951
        Sam, I want you         
    to meet somebody.           

07:33.019 --> 07:34.219
  Sam, this is Mark Newberger.  

07:34.287 --> 07:35.721
        Mark Newberger,         
      this is Sam Malone.       

07:35.789 --> 07:36.889
    Sam owns the bar.           

07:36.956 --> 07:39.258
Let me go get some of           
my other friends.               
                        Okay.   

07:39.325 --> 07:41.593
      Hey, guys, guys, I want to
      introduce you to somebody!

07:41.661 --> 07:43.996
Somebody stole my car.          

07:44.064 --> 07:45.931
            Oh, I've been there.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.599
Yeah? Really?                   

07:47.667 --> 07:49.101
              Yeah, my ex-lover.

07:49.169 --> 07:52.471
        First he stole my heart,
        then he stole my car.   

07:52.539 --> 07:55.607
            He?                 

07:55.675 --> 07:58.510
Aren't you supposed             
to be Rebecca's old flame?      

07:58.578 --> 08:00.612
                    Well, I'm   
                not that old.   

08:02.282 --> 08:04.316
             Thank God he didn't
            steal the water bed,

08:04.384 --> 08:07.152
         the lying little tramp.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.355
                        Meow!   

08:09.422 --> 08:11.357
      Like you were there.      

08:13.893 --> 08:15.828
                        REBECCA:
                        Mark,   

08:15.895 --> 08:17.596
        I want you              
    to meet all my friends.     

08:17.664 --> 08:19.498
        All right,              
this is Dr. Sternin-Crane,      

08:19.566 --> 08:20.899
                    our resident
                     researcher.

08:20.967 --> 08:22.067
        This is Cliff Clavin,   

08:22.135 --> 08:24.737
our resident                    
trivia expert.                  

08:24.804 --> 08:25.838
                    This is Norm
                    Peterson,   

08:25.905 --> 08:28.941
our... resident.                

08:29.009 --> 08:31.810
              Uh, this is Woody,
                the bartender   

08:31.878 --> 08:33.178
and Carla,                      
the waitress.                   

08:33.246 --> 08:35.246
                 And what do you
                    do, Rebecca?
(whispering):                   
Shut up!                        

08:35.315 --> 08:37.850
        Thought I could trick   
            her into telling us.

08:39.885 --> 08:41.820
Oh, Lilith,                     
I feel so victimized.           

08:41.888 --> 08:43.822
I feel so angry.                

08:43.890 --> 08:45.391
I don't know what to do.        

08:45.458 --> 08:47.493
            Well, actually, Sam,
        this is precisely how   

08:47.560 --> 08:49.495
                  victim support
             groups got started.

08:49.562 --> 08:51.864
    People who were suffering   
        and unable to cope found

08:51.931 --> 08:53.165
                they felt better

08:53.233 --> 08:55.267
            if they were able to
        share those feelings.   

08:55.335 --> 08:57.803
Well, maybe I should try        
to get in one of those groups.  

08:57.871 --> 08:59.505
I wonder if they have           
a group for people              

08:59.572 --> 09:02.441
who have had high-performance   
automobiles stolen.             

09:02.509 --> 09:03.909
                    You had a   
                     car stolen?
Yeah.                           

09:04.077 --> 09:05.210
            What kind was it?   

09:05.278 --> 09:07.680
'64 Corvette.                   

09:07.747 --> 09:10.315
          '57 Tee-Bird          
      two weeks ago today.      

09:10.383 --> 09:12.351
    Oh, man.                    

09:12.419 --> 09:15.087
Does it still                   
really hurt inside?             

09:15.155 --> 09:16.989
                  Sometimes more
                    than others.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.991
                  Like, when I'm
                  late for work,

09:19.059 --> 09:21.460
      and I run out of the house
         and try and jump in it.

09:21.528 --> 09:23.996
              Just end up in the
                 gutter weeping.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.131
Oh, man, I hear you,            
I hear you.                     

09:26.199 --> 09:27.199
                         It just
                     isn't fair.

09:27.267 --> 09:28.634
Oh, no kidding.                 

09:28.702 --> 09:31.904
You know, when bad things happen
to good-looking people.         

09:33.640 --> 09:36.642
                  Oh, here's you
                in glee club.   

09:36.710 --> 09:39.378
                  Captain of the
                    debate team.

09:39.446 --> 09:40.579
Mm-hmm.                         
                Oh, Mark, you...

09:40.647 --> 09:42.815
                 Oh, look, Water
                  Polo Champion.

09:42.882 --> 09:44.216
                        Oh.     

09:44.284 --> 09:46.752
                     Head of the
                 prom committee.

09:46.820 --> 09:47.953
    Most likely to succeed.     

09:48.021 --> 09:49.521
            Are you in there,   
                      Miss Howe?

09:49.589 --> 09:50.789
     Well, sure I am. Here.     

09:54.961 --> 09:57.062
    I... I know I am.           

09:57.130 --> 09:58.931
Wait. There.                    
                Oh, yes.        

09:58.998 --> 10:01.133
     Yes, there's my elbow      
        on protest day.         

10:01.201 --> 10:02.468
                             Oh.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.503
                What were you   
                     protesting?

10:04.571 --> 10:05.804
      Oh, I-I don't know.       

10:05.872 --> 10:08.507
    The war, cafeteria food,    
        the bomb.               

10:08.575 --> 10:10.275
 Uh, it's just a real neat way  
         to meet kids.          

10:10.343 --> 10:12.644
         Look at this.          

10:12.712 --> 10:14.346
         18 years old--         

10:14.414 --> 10:16.448
    ready to graduate           
     and take on the world.     

10:16.516 --> 10:17.950
                  Wait a minute.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.319
         You graduated from high
        school when you were 18?

10:20.387 --> 10:22.354
                 What, did Daddy
              pull some strings?

10:27.727 --> 10:28.861
                    (gasps)     

10:28.928 --> 10:30.963
             Look at this! Look,
         look, look, look, look!

10:31.031 --> 10:33.198
        Here's our production   
            of <i>South Pacific.</i>   

10:33.266 --> 10:36.969
     Oh, Mark, you were the most
    powerful Emile de Becque.   

10:37.037 --> 10:38.637
Oh, and you were a great...     

10:38.705 --> 10:41.140
one of the nurses that washed   
Nellie Forbush's hair.          

10:41.207 --> 10:42.975
Hey, Kelly,                     
how's it going back there?      

10:43.043 --> 10:45.844
Oh, fine. I just came out       
      to get myself a soda      

10:45.912 --> 10:47.846
         and some suds          
    for the Philster.           

10:50.950 --> 10:52.685
Kelly, why are you              
doing this?                     

10:52.752 --> 10:54.653
                  I want Woody's
             friends to like me.

10:54.721 --> 10:56.455
Did you buy them                
a round?                        
                            Yes.

10:56.523 --> 10:58.724
You'll never                    
get rid of them.                

11:00.827 --> 11:02.027
                You know, Carla,

11:02.095 --> 11:03.996
             you're the only one
              of Woody's friends

11:04.064 --> 11:05.898
                  that I haven't
            spent time with yet.

11:05.965 --> 11:08.033
                 Let's you and I
            have a chat, hmm?   

11:08.101 --> 11:11.270
I'd better put on               
my thinking cap.                

11:13.139 --> 11:15.007
Oh, doll,                       
I have got to run.              

11:15.075 --> 11:16.175
Kiss, kiss.                     

11:16.242 --> 11:17.343
                    Oh, Mark,   
                        so soon?

11:17.410 --> 11:19.178
      Yeah. Well, I found       
     this great apartment,      

11:19.245 --> 11:22.681
but the rent is sky-high,       
 so I'm interviewing roommates. 

11:22.749 --> 11:24.483
This could be exhausting.       

11:24.551 --> 11:25.784
             Later.             

11:27.087 --> 11:29.688
So that was                     
the old boyfriend, huh?         

11:29.756 --> 11:32.257
(sighing):                      
Yeah. Can you believe it?       

11:32.325 --> 11:35.361
How could I have been           
so stupid?                      

11:35.428 --> 11:37.963
I should have seen it           
way back in high school.        

11:38.031 --> 11:40.132
            Well, we all have   
                our blind spots.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.002
    Yeah. This one was just     
 staring me right in the face.  

11:44.371 --> 11:47.106
 He is the perfect man for me.  

11:48.908 --> 11:51.310
    I think this is the man     

11:51.378 --> 11:53.345
     that I'm gonna marry!      

11:53.413 --> 11:54.646
(clapping)                      

12:05.225 --> 12:06.892
         Mr. Peterson.          

12:06.960 --> 12:08.227
                        Yeah?   
It's your barber                
on the phone,                   

12:08.294 --> 12:09.461
and he says it's been two days. 

12:09.529 --> 12:10.796
        He wants to know        
    when you're coming back.    

12:10.864 --> 12:11.797
    What should I tell him?     

12:11.865 --> 12:13.666
                Tell him what   
                    I tell Vera.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.135
    Uh, he'll be home           
        after one more.         

12:16.202 --> 12:17.870
Yeah, I'll tell you,            
Cliffie, uh,                    

12:17.937 --> 12:19.138
when it comes                   
to photography,                 

12:19.205 --> 12:20.773
your ma's quite                 
a hotshot.                      

12:20.840 --> 12:22.107
          Yeah, yeah,           
    she's pretty good.          

12:22.175 --> 12:23.375
          Uh, you like          
         this one, huh?         

12:23.443 --> 12:24.777
Yeah.                           

12:24.844 --> 12:27.813
  That's me planting Old Glory  
     on the lunar surface.      

12:27.881 --> 12:29.415
             Here's my favorite.

12:29.482 --> 12:32.785
                It's you getting
         hitched to Princess Di.

12:33.853 --> 12:37.156
        Yeah, what a day        
        that was.               

12:38.291 --> 12:39.558
        Excuse me,              
         is this where          

12:39.626 --> 12:41.093
    the victim support group    
          is meeting?           

12:41.161 --> 12:42.494
        Yeah, right over        
      by the office there.      

12:42.562 --> 12:43.696
    I'll be right with you.     

12:43.763 --> 12:45.564
                There you go.   

12:45.632 --> 12:48.300
Sam, uh, am I                   
to understand                   

12:48.368 --> 12:49.601
 that you took it upon yourself 

12:49.669 --> 12:51.003
        to form a               
     victim support group?      

12:51.071 --> 12:52.838
         I think that's         
    an excellent idea.          

12:52.906 --> 12:55.140
        Well, actually,         
     it was Lilith's idea.      

12:56.276 --> 12:57.976
    It'll never work,           
        I hope you know.        

13:02.215 --> 13:03.248
    You Tom's friend?           

13:03.316 --> 13:05.050
                  Oh, yeah, I'm,
                      uh, Kirby,

13:05.118 --> 13:07.152
                      1967 vinyl
                covered hardtop,

13:07.220 --> 13:10.289
            sun fire yellow, 427
        high performance engine.

13:10.357 --> 13:11.423
Oh, yeah, yeah.                 

13:11.491 --> 13:13.625
Hi, hi, I'm Sam, I spoke        
to you on the phone.            

13:13.693 --> 13:16.462
'64 ragtop, black interior,     
rally red                       

13:16.529 --> 13:17.996
with, uh,                       
knock-off hubs.                 

13:18.064 --> 13:19.598
          Good to know you, man.

13:19.666 --> 13:20.599
             Yeah.              

13:22.836 --> 13:24.069
          This is '70           

13:24.137 --> 13:25.504
        Cutlass Supreme         
          convertible,          

13:25.572 --> 13:27.206
              uh, white interior
                 with overdrive.

13:27.273 --> 13:29.441
    I'm sorry, I'm not very good
  with names-- what's your name?

13:29.509 --> 13:31.043
Sam.                            
                     Sam, right.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.712
        Shall we?               

13:35.115 --> 13:36.382
  Honey, come on, sweetheart.   

13:36.449 --> 13:38.317
 We... we got the office here,  
        thank you.              

13:38.385 --> 13:39.318
             Sorry.             

13:39.386 --> 13:41.787
        I'm almost ready        
        for my big date.        

13:41.855 --> 13:43.022
                Hey, guys.      

13:43.089 --> 13:44.423
     Don't wait up for me.      

13:44.491 --> 13:46.291
Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.       
            (laughs)            

13:46.359 --> 13:48.060
If she was only a...            

13:48.128 --> 13:49.928
             horse with a broken
            leg or something,   

13:49.996 --> 13:51.797
             we could shoot her.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.834
Well, hey,                      
Norm, Norm, Normie,             

13:55.902 --> 13:57.102
we... we've got                 
to tell her.                    

13:57.170 --> 13:58.203
Come on.                        

13:58.271 --> 14:00.072
One of us has got               
to tell her-- let's go.         

14:00.140 --> 14:01.106
        One, two, three.        

14:01.174 --> 14:02.174
                      All right!

14:02.242 --> 14:03.676
                 My rock smashes
                  your scissors.

14:03.743 --> 14:05.444
Oh, no, not these               
scissors, pal.                  

14:05.512 --> 14:07.946
                        What?   

14:08.014 --> 14:10.416
This is a, uh, special          
titanium steel alloy...         

14:10.483 --> 14:12.484
            Oh, give me a break!

14:12.552 --> 14:14.219
Developed by NASA               
for the space program.          

14:14.287 --> 14:16.422
These scissors would smash      
your rock to smithereens, pal.  

14:16.489 --> 14:18.624
            No, no, no, not this
        rock-- this rock happens

14:18.692 --> 14:20.125
          to be Kryptonite, from
             the planet Krypton.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.760
Oh, for                         
crying out...                   
                    Maybe you've
            heard of it, huh?   

14:21.828 --> 14:22.895
Sounds to me                    
like you guys                   

14:22.962 --> 14:24.263
are trying to get out           
of telling her.                 

14:24.330 --> 14:26.398
Oh, well, gee, Woody,           
if you're so brave,             

14:26.466 --> 14:28.634
why don't you, uh,              
go back there and tell her?     

14:28.702 --> 14:30.602
    All right, I will.          

14:30.670 --> 14:32.304
     'Cause you know what?      

14:32.372 --> 14:33.605
    That's what friends do.     

14:33.673 --> 14:35.040
 They look out for each other.  

14:35.108 --> 14:37.376
 If one friend knows something  
that another friend needs       

14:37.444 --> 14:39.778
to know, then he lets them know,
    even if it's difficult.     

14:39.846 --> 14:41.547
     That's what friendship     
         is all about.          

14:45.285 --> 14:47.119
What am I supposed to tell her? 

14:47.187 --> 14:49.655
Tell her that her friend,       
Mark, is gay.                   

14:49.723 --> 14:53.025
          (laughing):           
Oh, I could never tell her that.

14:54.027 --> 14:55.928
                    Okay.       

14:55.995 --> 14:57.796
Hey, girls,                     
here's a little trick           

14:57.864 --> 14:58.964
I learned                       
in high school.                 

14:59.032 --> 15:02.234
  You put on your lipstick...   

15:02.302 --> 15:03.369
     then you powder them.      

15:03.436 --> 15:04.636
        That way,               
    when you're making out,     

15:04.704 --> 15:06.505
you don't get the lipstick      
    all over the boy.           

15:06.573 --> 15:07.773
        (giggles)               
                            Aha.

15:07.841 --> 15:09.308
                        Rebecca,

15:09.376 --> 15:11.610
I believe you're laboring       
under a misconception...        

15:11.678 --> 15:13.212
                 Oh, no, Lilith.

15:13.279 --> 15:14.680
    Rebecca, you see,           
          what Lilith           

15:14.748 --> 15:16.515
        is trying to say        
        is that...              

15:16.583 --> 15:19.151
  the powder isn't gonna keep   
the lipstick off the boy,       

15:19.219 --> 15:22.221
    but if he really cares,     
      he's not gonna mind.      

15:22.288 --> 15:24.490
    Yeah.                       
                    Yeah.       

15:24.557 --> 15:26.525
So just go on out               
and have a great time.          

15:26.626 --> 15:29.228
            Oh, thank you, guys!

15:29.295 --> 15:30.629
                Bye!            

15:33.166 --> 15:34.667
Why didn't you                  
let me tell her?                

15:34.768 --> 15:36.101
      'Cause it would be wrong. 

15:36.169 --> 15:37.736
                     It-It's not
                    our place   

15:37.804 --> 15:39.772
            to interfere with   
        their personal lives.   

15:39.839 --> 15:42.274
              That's why they're
        called "personal lives."

15:42.342 --> 15:43.876
              It's not our place
                    to play God.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.645
Well, actually,                 
I pulled down 60 big ones       

15:46.713 --> 15:49.148
last year playing God,          
but I see your point.           

15:49.215 --> 15:50.983
And I owe you an apology.       

15:51.051 --> 15:53.218
 I actually thought you didn't  
        want to tell her        

15:53.286 --> 15:54.553
so that she would be humiliated,

15:54.621 --> 15:56.422
    at which point you          
     would make fun of her.     

15:56.489 --> 15:58.123
    See how wrong you were?     

16:00.427 --> 16:02.428
         (door closes)          

16:02.495 --> 16:04.530
    How was your date           
      last night, Rebecca?      

16:04.597 --> 16:06.198
        Get lucky?              

16:06.266 --> 16:07.966
        (laughing)              

16:08.034 --> 16:10.869
        Okay, let's talk some   
          more about how we feel

16:10.937 --> 16:13.238
                about having our
                    cars stolen.

16:13.306 --> 16:16.475
                 Alice, you want
                to start off?   

16:16.543 --> 16:18.777
I feel empty.                   

16:19.779 --> 16:20.813
             Okay.              

16:20.880 --> 16:22.181
          Empty, how?           

16:22.248 --> 16:24.817
Like...                         

16:24.884 --> 16:27.186
a Crock-Pot?                    

16:28.922 --> 16:30.756
                Let me... let me
                    just respond

16:30.824 --> 16:31.990
                to what Alice   
                      just said,

16:32.058 --> 16:34.426
            you know, that...   
        that Crock-Pot thing.   

16:34.494 --> 16:38.163
     Yeah, yeah, that's me.     

16:38.231 --> 16:41.266
Sometimes when I'm walking      
down the street,                

16:41.334 --> 16:44.236
I think I see my car            
out of the corner of my eye.    

16:44.304 --> 16:46.605
             Let me, let me just
      say something here, you...

16:46.673 --> 16:49.908
          That... that          
  "corner of the eye" thing...  

16:49.976 --> 16:51.543
        yeah, that's me.        

16:52.879 --> 16:55.214
  Guys, you... I just thought   
    of something, you know.     

16:55.281 --> 16:57.950
     I mean, maybe our cars     
    weren't actually stolen.    

16:58.018 --> 17:00.052
Maybe... maybe they             
were just towed by the city     

17:00.120 --> 17:01.720
            and it's... and it's
          taking them time to...

17:01.788 --> 17:04.656
    to process the paperwork    
        and, you know...        

17:04.723 --> 17:06.858
        and, uh...              

17:06.925 --> 17:08.761
        (sobbing)               

17:13.465 --> 17:15.166
I think what Kirby's going      
          through here          

17:15.234 --> 17:17.736
is what they call denial.       

17:17.804 --> 17:20.172
                    (crying):   
                I feel so silly!

17:20.240 --> 17:22.907
Oh, no, man, come on,           
don't say that, don't be...     

17:22.976 --> 17:24.343
This is not silly;              
this is beautiful.              

17:24.411 --> 17:25.577
This is what                    
it's all about.                 

17:25.645 --> 17:26.712
        You know,               
    I think it's true.          

17:26.780 --> 17:28.614
      Suffering does bring      
        people together.        

17:28.682 --> 17:31.016
 I tell you, I feel very close  
     to you all right now.      

17:31.151 --> 17:32.718
I-I just want to say I...       

17:32.786 --> 17:34.620
I treasure our friendship.      

17:34.688 --> 17:35.654
        (knock at door)         

17:35.722 --> 17:36.922
Hey, Sam.                       

17:36.990 --> 17:38.524
Police called--                 
they just found your car.       

17:39.626 --> 17:41.827
             Okay,              
        meeting's over.         

17:49.969 --> 17:51.570
That was a great                
dinner tonight.                 

17:51.638 --> 17:53.906
I haven't had osso buco         
that good in years.             

17:53.973 --> 17:55.774
                What the hell is
            osso buco anyway?   

17:55.842 --> 17:57.476
You don't want                  
to know.                        

17:58.745 --> 18:01.246
            Mark, I-I had the   
    greatest evening tonight.   

18:01.314 --> 18:03.449
  Well, we're gonna have a lot  
        of great nights.        

18:03.516 --> 18:05.684
    I want to pick up           
    right where we left off.    

18:05.752 --> 18:08.120
                  Do you want to
                start right now?

18:08.188 --> 18:10.255
             Sure.              
                        Okay.   

18:10.323 --> 18:12.424
                You just make   
        yourself comfortable,   

18:12.492 --> 18:15.160
         and I'll be right back.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.664
            I feel like we're   

18:18.732 --> 18:20.766
                  in high school
            again, don't you,   

18:20.834 --> 18:23.002
                Marcus Aurelius?

18:23.069 --> 18:25.704
  Yes, I do, Beckus Aurelius.   

18:25.772 --> 18:27.706
                  You remembered
                  my Latin name.

18:27.774 --> 18:28.907
Well, how could I forget?       

18:28.975 --> 18:30.075
         You're the one         
        who got me              

18:30.143 --> 18:31.076
     through Mr. Vincent's      
          Latin class.          

18:31.144 --> 18:32.244
                 (Rebecca gasps)

18:32.312 --> 18:35.114
             Oh, Mr. Vincent-- I
        forgot all about him.   

18:35.181 --> 18:37.616
                  Oh, God, I had
                    such a crush

18:37.684 --> 18:40.819
                    on that man.
        (softly):               
          Who didn't?           

18:45.759 --> 18:47.292
        Here I am.              

18:49.396 --> 18:51.430
      Be still, my heart.       

18:52.532 --> 18:54.733
Do you like what you see, Mark? 

18:54.801 --> 18:57.436
         It's gorgeous.         

18:57.504 --> 18:58.737
         Get over here.         

18:58.805 --> 19:00.506
        Give us a feel.         

19:00.573 --> 19:02.441
                        Okay.   

19:08.448 --> 19:10.416
         Fabulous.              

19:12.485 --> 19:13.952
Give it--                       
is it silk?                     

19:15.055 --> 19:16.755
Rayon?                          
I don't believe it!             

19:16.823 --> 19:18.957
So what do you do, you put it   
in a delicate cycle,            

19:19.025 --> 19:20.192
let it spin?                    
We have to talk.                

19:20.260 --> 19:21.760
              Mark, stop joking.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.396
              You know perfectly
             well that the point

19:24.464 --> 19:28.801
          of this nightie is not
        laundry instructions.   

19:28.868 --> 19:31.503
            The point of this   
                nightie is to...

19:31.571 --> 19:33.105
To what?                        

19:33.173 --> 19:37.209
                You know... a   
              man and a woman...

19:37.277 --> 19:39.745
    Where?                      

19:40.780 --> 19:42.715
                    Oh, Mark.   

19:42.782 --> 19:46.318
Rebecca, you know I'm gay,      
don't you?                      

19:47.387 --> 19:49.421
        Why, of course, I do!   

19:54.861 --> 19:56.795
              Why do you think I
             feel so comfortable

19:56.863 --> 19:59.164
 wearing this in front of you?  

20:01.301 --> 20:04.403
 I mean, this is my housecoat!  

20:04.471 --> 20:07.406
    I know it's sexy,           
    but I paint in it.          

20:10.210 --> 20:12.411
          You're gay?           

20:12.479 --> 20:14.680
 Don't tell me you didn't know. 

20:14.748 --> 20:16.949
    I mean, usually I assume    
that somebody is straight       

20:17.017 --> 20:18.550
 until I find out they're not.  

20:18.618 --> 20:20.986
         That's funny,          
I usually assume people are gay 

20:21.054 --> 20:22.621
 until I find out they're not.  

20:24.157 --> 20:26.225
Sometimes we find out together. 

20:26.292 --> 20:28.127
                Oh.             

20:28.194 --> 20:30.062
     I'm the one, aren't I?     

20:31.498 --> 20:33.932
    Yeah, I'm the one           
    that put you off girls.     

20:35.068 --> 20:36.902
          No, Rebecca.          
                 No, no, really,

20:36.970 --> 20:38.170
go ahead, you can say it.       

20:38.238 --> 20:39.972
     I've heard it before.      

20:43.510 --> 20:47.446
Rebecca, if anything,           
you confused me.                

20:47.514 --> 20:50.082
You're the only woman           
I've ever been attracted to.    

20:50.150 --> 20:52.017
            Thank you.          

20:52.085 --> 20:54.086
Oh, look at you--               
you're getting goose bumps.     

20:54.154 --> 20:55.754
Come on, let's cuddle up        
on the couch                    

20:55.822 --> 20:57.756
with a blanket, huh?            

21:04.264 --> 21:05.531
                         (sighs)

21:05.598 --> 21:07.333
                      So we both
                    like men?   

21:07.400 --> 21:09.335
    Yep.                        

21:11.404 --> 21:14.173
                Are we stupid   
                        or what?

21:14.240 --> 21:16.442
            They're so insincere

21:16.509 --> 21:18.644
                     and they're
            inconsiderate, rude.

21:18.712 --> 21:22.047
They lie,                       
they cheat on you.              

21:22.115 --> 21:24.650
         Men.                   
                        Men.    

21:24.718 --> 21:26.685
You know, things really         
would have been                 

21:26.753 --> 21:30.122
a lot easier                    
if I was attracted to women.    

21:30.190 --> 21:32.157
                        Me, too.

21:35.228 --> 21:37.229
                     You want to
                  watch some TV?

21:37.297 --> 21:38.697
Yeah, sure.                     

21:38.765 --> 21:41.266
Maybe there's                   
an old movie on, huh?           

21:43.970 --> 21:45.004
    Rebecca.                    

21:45.071 --> 21:46.605
                        Hmm?    

21:46.673 --> 21:48.807
What are you doing?             

21:48.875 --> 21:50.442
                 Looking for the
                 remote control.

21:52.112 --> 21:53.645
It's on the                     
coffee table.                   

21:55.248 --> 21:57.349
                 You can't blame
                  me for trying.
