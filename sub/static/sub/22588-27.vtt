01:47.358 --> 01:50.058
Sure'n it could be
harmless, sir.

01:50.060 --> 01:51.459
Uh, how so, Chief O'Hara?

01:51.461 --> 01:53.627
There was a piece
in the paper this morning.

01:53.629 --> 01:57.397
The Gotham City Museum
is unveiling a new exhibit

01:57.399 --> 01:59.699
of Egyptian antiques
this very day.

01:59.701 --> 02:03.335
Of course and this could
be just a publicity stunt.

02:03.337 --> 02:04.402
Yes, sir.

02:04.404 --> 02:05.169
Is there no limit

02:05.171 --> 02:08.538
to the brazen effrontery
of the press agent?

02:08.541 --> 02:11.475
I'll put paid
to their stunts.

02:11.677 --> 02:12.709
- 'Yes?'
- Uh, Bonnie.

02:12.711 --> 02:14.811
Get me my good friend,
millionaire Bruce Wayne.

02:14.813 --> 02:18.381
I expect he'll be at his
stately residence, Wayne Manor.

02:18.383 --> 02:20.850
Well, time to leave
for the museum, one and all.

02:20.852 --> 02:23.552
Mercy, yes. Let's not
be late, Bruce.

02:23.554 --> 02:28.890
There isn't anything I enjoy
more than a nice, fresh exhibit

02:28.892 --> 02:30.558
of Egyptian antiquities.

02:31.694 --> 02:32.726
What is it, Alfred?

02:32.728 --> 02:33.960
The telephone, madam.

02:33.962 --> 02:35.361
Police Commissioner Gordon

02:35.363 --> 02:37.629
wishes to speak with Mr. Wayne.

02:37.631 --> 02:39.597
- With me, Alfred?
- Uh, yes, sir.

02:39.599 --> 02:43.567
He was most distinct.
With Mr. Bruce Wayne.

02:43.569 --> 02:46.303
Excuse me, Aunt Harriet.

02:47.938 --> 02:48.771
Bruce Wayne speaking.

02:48.773 --> 02:51.306
Oh, um, sorry to bother you,
Bruce, but you're on

02:51.308 --> 02:54.275
the board of trustees of
the Gotham Museum, aren't you?

02:54.277 --> 02:56.243
Certainly,
I'm treasurer, in fact.

02:56.245 --> 02:58.311
'Well, you've gone
too far, Bruce.'

02:58.313 --> 03:01.447
This sphinx which has reared
itself at the park

03:01.449 --> 03:04.283
this terrifying
publicity stunt--

03:04.285 --> 03:05.851
This what?

03:05.853 --> 03:08.954
You mean...it isn't
a publicity stunt?

03:08.956 --> 03:13.858
My dear commissioner, I think
you've taken leave of your wits.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.993
Goodbye.

03:17.795 --> 03:21.597
Imagine...the idea
of the Gotham Museum

03:21.599 --> 03:22.931
pulling a publicity stunt.

03:22.933 --> 03:27.869
- So, if it's not a stunt..
- Precisely, Chief O'Hara.

03:27.871 --> 03:30.972
This phenomenon takes
on new dimensions.

03:30.974 --> 03:34.008
Strange and sinister dimensions.

03:34.010 --> 03:39.747
In fact, there is only one man
alive who can take its measure.

03:52.859 --> 03:55.827
I'll summon him, sir.

04:09.840 --> 04:14.009
Bruce, come on. What on Earth
is the matter with you two?

04:14.011 --> 04:16.411
I don't know, Aunt Harriet.
It's just that..

04:16.413 --> 04:17.712
- A sphinx he said.
- Gosh, Bruce.

04:17.714 --> 04:21.548
- That means what it could mean.
- We'll know soon enough.

04:21.551 --> 04:23.517
Excuse me, sir.

04:23.519 --> 04:25.819
Something in red, Alfred?

04:25.821 --> 04:26.920
Precisely, sir.

04:26.922 --> 04:28.721
Great heavens.
How forgetful of me.

04:28.723 --> 04:30.489
This new volume
by a Professor Red

04:30.491 --> 04:32.324
on ancient Egyptian
cat worship cults.

04:32.326 --> 04:35.727
I'd promised the museum
committee I'd look through it.

04:35.729 --> 04:36.861
Come on, Dick.

04:36.863 --> 04:37.561
Bruce.

04:37.563 --> 04:38.828
Those antiquities have waited

04:38.830 --> 04:41.096
thousands of years
for us, Aunt Harriet

04:41.098 --> 04:43.998
they'll wait a little longer.

04:45.433 --> 04:48.735
Mercy alive.
Such an impetuous pair.

04:48.737 --> 04:53.339
There should be some way
to harness such energy.

04:55.709 --> 04:56.542
Yes, commissioner.

04:56.544 --> 04:59.578
'A strange and terrible threat
to Gotham City.'

04:59.580 --> 05:01.846
An ultimatum from the
remote past.

05:01.848 --> 05:04.114
We're on our way.

05:04.116 --> 05:05.014
Holy hieroglyphics!

05:05.016 --> 05:06.949
This might mean
a battle royal.

05:06.951 --> 05:09.651
Not the first, Dick,
not the last.

There's no doubt at all..

that arch criminal, King Tut.

06:46.199 --> 06:49.767

he died in that warehouse fire.

06:49.769 --> 06:50.734

06:56.741 --> 06:59.976
Just what was his threat,
commissioner?

06:59.978 --> 07:00.977
Grandiose, Batman.

07:00.979 --> 07:03.245
He claimed Gotham City
for his own.

07:03.247 --> 07:05.180
In a greedy female voice.

07:05.182 --> 07:09.784
So...our mad pharaoh
has found himself a Nefertiti.

07:09.786 --> 07:13.788
Some hapless female
entrapped in a life of crime!

07:13.790 --> 07:16.023
The situation is grim, Batman.

07:16.025 --> 07:17.024
We've cordoned off the park

07:17.026 --> 07:19.259
but panic will soon
raise its ugly head.

07:19.261 --> 07:21.761
We could call out
the National Guard.

07:21.763 --> 07:25.664
Have them blast that pigging
sphinx with their artillery.

07:25.666 --> 07:27.065
No, Chief O'Hara. No.

07:27.067 --> 07:28.599
- No?
- No.

07:28.601 --> 07:29.566
If that were our objective

07:29.568 --> 07:32.268
I could do it with
the Batmobile's Bat-beam.

07:32.270 --> 07:33.002
Batman's right.

07:33.004 --> 07:36.872
King Tut may be a super-crook,
but he's a sick man too.

07:36.874 --> 07:38.907
Precisely, Robin.

07:38.909 --> 07:39.741
Let's not forget..

07:39.743 --> 07:43.678
...that he was once an eminent
professor at Yale University.

07:43.680 --> 07:47.081
Then he was struck on
the head during a student riot

07:47.083 --> 07:50.751
'and awoke with
a strange double delusion'

07:50.753 --> 07:53.353
that Gotham City is the
reincarnation of ancient Thebes

07:53.355 --> 07:59.726
and he himself, the pharaoh
known to history as King Tut.

08:00.895 --> 08:02.828
This man is to be pitied.

08:02.830 --> 08:04.629
Pitied, Batman? Ha!

08:04.631 --> 08:06.797
How can one pity
a criminal who threatens

08:06.799 --> 08:07.964
our entire citizenry
with death?

08:07.966 --> 08:11.634
Pitied, commissioner.
Tempered with caution.

08:11.636 --> 08:15.104
Our first aim is to thwart
his criminal plans.

08:15.106 --> 08:16.205
What could it be?

08:16.207 --> 08:19.007
A mad dream to make
subjects of us all.

08:19.009 --> 08:20.875
'But why tip us off?'

08:20.877 --> 08:23.744
Why warn us that
he's trying to make a comeback?

08:23.746 --> 08:25.779
Maybe this sphinx
will give us a clue.

08:25.781 --> 08:28.748
Robin's right. And we
don't have a moment to lose.

08:28.750 --> 08:32.784
Let's take a close look
at that inscrutable lady.

08:32.787 --> 08:36.020
Be careful, Batman.
Be careful.

08:36.722 --> 08:40.091
<i> Meanwhile, in the palace</i>
<i> of King Tut</i>

08:40.092 --> 08:44.862
<i> bizarre remnant of last year's</i>
<i> Gotham City Exposition</i>

<i> Chief O'Hara's question</i>

<i> inside the moldering</i>
<i> Great Hall.</i>

08:51.370 --> 08:52.168
I don't get it.

08:52.170 --> 08:55.338
If you're gonna move in
on somebody's territory

08:55.340 --> 08:56.271
why tip him off?

08:56.273 --> 08:58.806
How should I know?
I'm only the Grand Vizier.

08:58.808 --> 09:01.241
Why don't you ask
His Royal Highness?

09:17.624 --> 09:20.392
You may rise.

09:22.161 --> 09:25.830
Loyal subjects, we are
pleased to inform you

09:25.832 --> 09:29.767
that Phase 1 of our royal
master plan has succeeded

09:29.769 --> 09:31.168
as prophesied.

09:31.170 --> 09:33.870
Hey, that's great, boss.

09:33.872 --> 09:36.305
I mean, Your Royal Highness.

09:36.307 --> 09:40.909
Phase 2 will now
be put into being.

09:40.911 --> 09:44.178
- Are there any questions?
- I got one.

09:44.180 --> 09:45.712
You may speak, Royal Scrivener.

09:45.714 --> 09:49.082
Like why? I mean why keep
that hunka rock in the park

09:49.084 --> 09:51.518
and tip off the suckers
what we're gonna do?

09:51.520 --> 09:54.353
You're a twit.

09:54.355 --> 09:56.788
'It's merely a sovereign
subterfuge'

09:56.790 --> 10:01.860
to exterminate a winged
rodent once and for all..

10:01.862 --> 10:03.194
...Batman!

10:03.196 --> 10:07.565
He should be biting
at the bait at about now.

10:07.567 --> 10:09.300
Oh, boy!

10:09.302 --> 10:12.569
All hail to King Tut.

10:12.571 --> 10:15.338
Great thorn of Thebes.

10:15.340 --> 10:18.541
Nemesis of the Nile.

10:19.876 --> 10:23.345
Thank you, Grand Vizier.
Thank you.

10:23.347 --> 10:25.714
It was delightfully spoken.

10:26.116 --> 10:30.852
However, just in the off chance
that the Dynamic Duo

10:30.854 --> 10:33.454
should elude our
snick-snack snare

10:33.456 --> 10:37.257
battle stations
for the royal barque

10:37.259 --> 10:42.228
will land our
sinister sphinx upon.

10:42.929 --> 10:43.995
What do you make
of it, Batman?

10:43.997 --> 10:49.300
A rather good imitation of the
Fourth Dynasty sphinx of Giza.

10:50.503 --> 10:53.103
Holy hurricane. What's that?

10:53.105 --> 10:54.237
I think it means the sphinx

10:54.239 --> 10:56.772
is going to make
another pronouncement.

10:56.774 --> 10:59.141
'Now, hear this.'

10:59.143 --> 11:00.475
'Now, hear this.'

11:00.477 --> 11:04.846
'Whosoever transgresses
upon the sacred sphinx'

11:04.848 --> 11:07.782
'shall be smitten
down by Anubis.'

11:07.784 --> 11:11.218
'The jackal God,
Guardian of the Cemeteries.'

11:11.220 --> 11:15.288
'And that goes
double for Batman.'

11:15.290 --> 11:18.124
- Challenge?
- So be it.

11:18.126 --> 11:20.059
Up we go.

11:27.199 --> 11:28.933
'What do you think, Batman?'

11:28.935 --> 11:30.434
Could it be full
of King Tut's henchmen?

11:30.436 --> 11:34.538
If it is, there must be
a secret entrance somewhere.

11:35.206 --> 11:37.240
Look here.

11:37.441 --> 11:38.240
This must be it.

11:38.242 --> 11:40.108
Don't touch that handle, Robin.

11:40.110 --> 11:42.276
We don't know what
we're up against yet.

11:42.278 --> 11:46.380
You're right. The sphinx
could be booby trapped.

11:47.215 --> 11:50.083
Let's play it safe.

12:10.236 --> 12:13.504
Holy whiskers!
That was a close shave!

12:13.506 --> 12:16.240
There's no longer
any doubt, Robin.

12:16.242 --> 12:22.346
Brilliant, warped mind of
King Tut is bent on murdering.

12:33.923 --> 12:36.557
Signal from Nefertiti.

12:36.559 --> 12:37.524
Indeed.

12:37.526 --> 12:42.562
What does Great Ra, God
of the Sun have to inform us?

12:45.299 --> 12:48.167
Dynamic Duo escaped.

12:49.537 --> 12:52.871
Curses of Amenhotep!

12:54.306 --> 12:55.939
Your pharaoh speaks.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.841
Slaves and Helot swordsmen

12:58.843 --> 13:00.142
prepare for action.

13:00.144 --> 13:01.109
What's our next move, Batman?

13:01.111 --> 13:04.145
- Destroy this crooked sphinx?
- No, I don't think so, Robin.

13:04.147 --> 13:07.782
It's better to leave it here
under police observation so..

13:08.183 --> 13:09.716
Robin.

13:09.718 --> 13:11.184
Look, over there.

13:13.555 --> 13:14.587
Holy masquerade!

13:14.589 --> 13:17.723
It's an odd getup
for a walk in the park.

13:17.725 --> 13:18.490
Odd indeed.

13:18.492 --> 13:21.159
It's a costume of the
Fourteenth Dynasty.

13:21.161 --> 13:22.860
Kind Tut's dynasty.

13:22.862 --> 13:25.028
Wow! Let's get her!

13:26.530 --> 13:29.031
Halt, you deluded creature.

13:29.033 --> 13:32.801
We've got you.
Escape is impossible.

13:38.239 --> 13:42.342
Holy asp!
A trick Egyptian snake.

13:43.477 --> 13:46.145
Look out, Robin!

14:05.996 --> 14:07.997
Quick! Let's hot-foot it
after 'em.

14:07.999 --> 14:08.897
No, Robin, wait.

14:09.299 --> 14:11.532
I think that's exactly
what they want.

14:11.534 --> 14:12.533
- Why?
- An old game.

14:12.535 --> 14:14.601
To draw us away
from their real target.

14:14.603 --> 14:17.837
Of course. The Egyptian
exhibit at the museum.

14:17.839 --> 14:18.838
Right. The museum.

14:18.840 --> 14:23.375
Where Bruce Wayne will
deal them a small surprise.

14:28.415 --> 14:33.352
<i> A short while later</i>
<i> at the Gotham City Museum..</i>

14:33.354 --> 14:36.521
You'll know it's the twin
emblems of the two lands.

14:36.523 --> 14:38.856
The large carnelian cobra here

14:38.858 --> 14:41.258
which is representative
of Upper Egypt

14:41.260 --> 14:44.861
and the vulture, which is
the cult sign of Lower Egypt

14:44.863 --> 14:46.495
and carved from lapis lazuli.

14:46.497 --> 14:47.462
- Mr. Wayne.
- Yes.

14:47.464 --> 14:50.331
- What's the value of the crown?
- I don't really know.

14:50.333 --> 14:53.233
Except that as a rare
and historic art treasure

14:53.235 --> 14:54.234
it's undoubtedly priceless.

14:54.236 --> 14:58.605
Please inform your readers that
it's well-guarded at all times.

15:00.442 --> 15:01.874
Now, ladies and gentlemen

15:01.876 --> 15:03.308
in deference to the press here

15:03.310 --> 15:05.510
which has deadlines
to meet I'm sure

15:05.512 --> 15:10.381
I propose now to offer to you
the <i> pieces de resistance</i>

15:10.383 --> 15:13.550
the mummified remains of..

15:13.552 --> 15:15.285
Hmm.

15:15.686 --> 15:17.853
All we know about this
particular gentleman

15:17.855 --> 15:21.289
is that he was a king
in the Fourteenth Dynasty

15:21.291 --> 15:23.224
and reigned in 1500 BC.

15:23.226 --> 15:25.192
Now, if my arithmetic is correct

15:25.194 --> 15:28.461
that would mean that
he's been dead approximately

15:28.463 --> 15:30.596
thirty five hundred years.

15:30.598 --> 15:32.598
And I believe it's
safe to state that

15:32.600 --> 15:38.170
this particular pharaoh fellow
will not rise again.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.193
It's alive.
The sphinx prophecy was right.

16:02.195 --> 16:03.360
The king has risen again.

16:03.362 --> 16:06.396
Is there a doctor in the house?

16:07.197 --> 16:09.598
It is impossible,
isn't it, Bruce?

16:09.600 --> 16:11.232
It's fantastic! Incredible.

16:11.234 --> 16:15.769
The preservation techniques.
What a man he must've been!

16:16.837 --> 16:20.406
- The imagination boggles.
- 'The ambulance is here.'

16:20.408 --> 16:23.642
Make way for
the stretcher bearers.

16:31.450 --> 16:33.451
I'll leave you to
restore order here.

16:33.453 --> 16:36.921
I think I should go
along to the hospital.

16:41.960 --> 16:44.561
Mr. Wayne, what happened?
Is he still alive?

16:44.563 --> 16:48.398
- What about the prophecy now?
- No comment.

16:54.637 --> 16:55.703
Hey, he's coming to.

16:55.705 --> 16:59.373
I rather expected he would. He
may want to tell us something.

16:59.375 --> 17:02.576
- What do you think he's saying?
- Shh. Shh.

17:02.710 --> 17:04.877
- Maybe this will help.
- Shh.

17:35.708 --> 17:37.875
All hail Your Majesty.

17:37.877 --> 17:39.610
Phase 2 has worked perfectly.

17:39.612 --> 17:44.448
Naturally, it was
foreseen in the scrolls.

17:44.450 --> 17:47.651
To the palace with this...Helot.

17:47.653 --> 17:50.687
Your whim is our
command, O Majesty.

18:43.504 --> 18:46.539
Nefertiti, you abandoned wench.

18:46.541 --> 18:47.706
How many times must I tell you

18:47.708 --> 18:53.645
queens consume nectar
and ambrosia, not hot dogs?

18:53.779 --> 18:54.512
So I get hungry.

18:54.514 --> 18:57.982
Living on nothing but figs
and dates and pomegranates.

18:57.984 --> 19:01.885
- You want a bite?
- Dah! Unclean.

19:02.653 --> 19:06.088
I must proclaim
my reincarnation

19:06.090 --> 19:07.923
to the faithful.

19:07.925 --> 19:10.792
Give me the telephone.

19:17.699 --> 19:21.001
Osman Abu, switcher of messages

19:21.003 --> 19:22.535
your pharaoh speaks.

19:22.537 --> 19:25.070
'What is your desire,
great pharaoh?'

19:25.072 --> 19:27.939
Connect me to the voice box
of the sphinx

19:27.941 --> 19:30.841
in Gotham Central Park, please.

19:30.843 --> 19:33.510
'It shall be done,
great pharaoh.'

19:35.046 --> 19:40.849
Instruct the royal charioteer
to my palace with haste.

19:45.055 --> 19:48.022
Home, toots, and step on it.

20:24.223 --> 20:27.158
'"Now, hear this.
Now, hear this.'

20:27.160 --> 20:31.762
"As it was written in the stars
so it has come to pass.

20:31.764 --> 20:35.732
"The great King of the Nile
has risen from the sands of time

20:35.734 --> 20:39.402
"to reclaim his lost kingdom.

20:41.538 --> 20:47.576
'The next voice you will hear
will be King Tut himself."'

20:51.149 --> 20:54.383
Loyal subjects and Helots

20:54.385 --> 20:56.151
this is your king.

20:56.153 --> 20:58.621
'As our first royal act,
we have perpetrated'

20:58.623 --> 21:02.391
'the abduction of your
millionaire philanthropist'

21:02.393 --> 21:03.325
'Bruce Wayne.'

21:03.327 --> 21:07.729
'He will be held prisoner until
our royal demands are met.'

21:07.731 --> 21:10.865
These demands will
be made known to you

21:10.867 --> 21:14.768
by our inscrutable sphinx
at a later date.

21:14.770 --> 21:20.673
'In the meantime, the police
are warned not to interfere'

21:20.675 --> 21:23.542
'and this includes
the Dynamic Duo'

21:23.544 --> 21:28.914
'and pass my words on
or  my reach.'

21:28.916 --> 21:31.650
Remember, Batman

21:31.652 --> 21:37.422
Bruce Wayne's life
is in your hand.

21:46.397 --> 21:49.365
I wonder how much he's
gonna ask of Bruce Wayne?

21:49.367 --> 21:52.534
I hear he's a rich millionaire.

21:52.536 --> 21:54.969
You know, Harry,
that Tut's a kook

21:54.971 --> 21:56.337
but he's got brains.

21:56.339 --> 21:58.405
I wouldn't be surprised
if he didn't wind up

21:58.407 --> 22:02.375
with the keenest gang
since old Moe got the hot squad.

22:09.481 --> 22:10.614
Robin speaking.

22:10.616 --> 22:13.450
Uh, put Batman on, Boy Wonder.

22:13.452 --> 22:14.317
It's a crisis.

22:14.319 --> 22:16.319
Bruce Wayne has
just been kidnapped.

22:16.321 --> 22:18.521
Bruce Wayne kidnapped?
How? When?

22:18.523 --> 22:19.321
Only minutes ago.

22:19.323 --> 22:21.723
The King Tut resurrection was
just an elaborate smokescreen

22:21.725 --> 22:24.425
to conceal his real crime.
Let me speak to Batman.

22:24.427 --> 22:26.560
Commissioner,
I don't know where he is.

22:26.562 --> 22:29.396
As soon as you hear from him,
there's not much time.

22:29.398 --> 22:32.499
Bruce Wayne is one of our
most prominent millionaires.

22:32.501 --> 22:33.366
So I've heard.

22:33.368 --> 22:36.302
This arch-abductor may ask
a king's ransom for him.

22:36.304 --> 22:36.969
We've got to move fast.

22:36.971 --> 22:39.871
I...I can't understand
where Batman could be?

22:39.873 --> 22:42.306
Neither can I.
Goodbye, commissioner.

22:42.308 --> 22:44.374
You've heard the calamitous
news, Master Robin?

22:44.376 --> 22:48.277
- Yes. Does Aunt Harriet know?
- On the 3 o'clock news.

22:48.279 --> 22:49.578
I'm afraid she's badly shaken.

22:49.580 --> 22:53.748
And I must admit,
it's left me a bit shaken too.

22:53.750 --> 22:55.349
Is there nothing to be done?

22:55.351 --> 22:56.717
Don't lose heart, Alfred.

22:56.719 --> 22:58.618
Batman is, well, Batman!

22:58.620 --> 23:01.587
He'll get a message
to us somehow.

24:02.345 --> 24:03.778
<i> Holy cliffhanger!</i>

24:03.780 --> 24:08.716
<i> Bruce Wayne hurtling</i>
<i> toward an awesome abyss!</i>

24:08.718 --> 24:09.850
<i> What will be his fate?</i>

24:09.852 --> 24:14.020
<i> How can he possibly</i>
<i> be saved this time?</i>

24:14.022 --> 24:15.421
<i> Be in front of your</i>

24:15.423 --> 24:17.623
<i> Bat-sets tomorrow night.</i>

24:17.625 --> 24:18.991
<i> Same time.</i>

24:18.993 --> 24:21.360
<i> Same channel.</i>

24:21.362 --> 24:21.960
<i> One hint</i>

24:21.962 --> 24:25.764
<i> the most horrendous</i>
<i> is yet to come.</i>
