''Diary of a Thin Man.''

02:06.326 --> 02:09.818
- Where you been?
- Hospital, helping Carmela.

02:09.863 --> 02:12.024
The devotion
that kid shows.

02:12.065 --> 02:14.556
l just think of
my Marie, the kids,

02:14.601 --> 02:17.365
in that situation,
God forbid.

02:17.403 --> 02:21.362
My ma-- who the fuck would take care
of her something happens?

02:21.407 --> 02:23.671
Except Sil and you guys.

02:28.548 --> 02:30.778
Colombians knock off
at noon.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.047
Then it's empty.

02:34.787 --> 02:36.846
Manager's unit's
down a flight.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.707
- Who's in there?
- Open it.

03:07.253 --> 03:09.016
What the fuck?

03:10.557 --> 03:12.457
Get back!

03:14.928 --> 03:17.123
- Shoot the prick.
- Get the fuck out of the way.

03:24.737 --> 03:26.864
Cocksucking miserable
Spic shit!

03:26.906 --> 03:28.840
lt's supposed to be
empty here daytimes.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.742
Jesus, my fucking balls!

03:35.148 --> 03:38.242
The money!

03:38.284 --> 03:40.445
Fuck, my fucking balls.

03:40.486 --> 03:42.750
- Oogatz here.
- The freeze.

03:45.091 --> 03:47.025
Nothing.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.688
Come on, let's blow.
Lot of fucking noise we made.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.720
Fuck that.

03:53.299 --> 03:55.199
Close the goddamn door.

04:10.683 --> 04:13.743
This fucking shit
for a lousy two Gs?

04:21.160 --> 04:23.958
Oh, Anthony.

04:23.997 --> 04:26.261
- Hi, Uncle Bobby.
- Hiya, sweetheart.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.768
Cugin'.

04:29.802 --> 04:31.793
l'm gonna go ahead.

04:33.506 --> 04:35.440
What's up?

04:35.475 --> 04:37.739
You were at South Mountain
Arena yesterday

04:37.777 --> 04:40.177
trying to buy a gun
from that asshole in the snack shop.

04:40.213 --> 04:41.578
Who told you that?

04:41.614 --> 04:43.639
We know how you feel,
but you can't do this.

04:43.683 --> 04:46.083
l can't believe you know this.
Who told you this?

04:46.119 --> 04:48.781
Look, if my pops was
laying in there shot up

04:48.821 --> 04:51.187
- l'd be thinking the same thing.
- But you can't go there.

04:51.224 --> 04:53.192
- Yeah, why the fuck not?
- Listen to me,

04:53.226 --> 04:56.024
l'm your uncle.
Junior's in federal lockup.

04:56.062 --> 04:57.893
No one's getting
to him there.

04:57.930 --> 04:59.898
Well, it's difficult,
but not impossible.

04:59.932 --> 05:02.696
Trust me. Your dad does not want
you to get involved.

05:02.735 --> 05:06.535
You gotta channel that rage elsewheres.
Golden Gloves.

05:06.572 --> 05:09.200
- What?
- Dumbbells or something.

05:09.242 --> 05:10.869
Fuck your girlfriend more.

05:10.910 --> 05:14.676
You little hothead here.

05:31.097 --> 05:34.498
- Hey.
- Hi.

05:34.534 --> 05:36.661
Did you park in emergency
or in the garage?

05:36.703 --> 05:38.694
What's going on
in there?

05:38.738 --> 05:42.139
They're on rounds or something,
Dr. Plepler and the lndian girl.

05:45.712 --> 05:47.543
Hi, did you bring me
my sweater?

05:47.580 --> 05:51.482
Your sweater?
Man, Jesus, fuck!

05:51.517 --> 05:54.543
All right, take it easy.
What is your problem?

05:54.587 --> 05:56.555
My problem is l'm old enough
to sit with Dad all night,

05:56.589 --> 05:58.853
be a messenger boy,
bring shit from the house,

05:58.891 --> 06:00.756
but l'm too young to deal
with the larger issues?

06:00.793 --> 06:03.785
- What are you talking about?
- Like you didn't put them up to it.

06:03.830 --> 06:06.060
Put who up to what?

06:08.034 --> 06:10.935
God, he was in such
a good mood this morning.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.899
l told the nurse

06:16.943 --> 06:19.241
that l thought he moved
his eyebrows at around 5:30.

06:19.278 --> 06:22.736
Did she pass that along?
'Cause if not, l'm gonna be furious.

06:22.782 --> 06:25.046
Mrs. Soprano, you're really
gonna have to recalibrate

06:25.084 --> 06:27.518
your expectations
at this point.

06:27.553 --> 06:30.078
We can't even maintain
his blood pressure

06:30.123 --> 06:31.556
at a level that we'd like.

06:31.591 --> 06:34.719
Until his fever dissipates
and his white cell count comes down,

06:34.761 --> 06:36.353
we're a long way
from home.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.091
But he's really
fighting.

06:45.972 --> 06:48.065
Mom, he's really strong.

06:48.107 --> 06:49.972
That is true.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.547
Hi, Dad.

07:31.551 --> 07:34.782
Monastery?

07:59.846 --> 08:02.610
Oh!

08:03.883 --> 08:07.046
l, uh...

08:07.086 --> 08:10.522
l received these
this morning.

08:12.391 --> 08:14.825
Do l really look
that much like this guy?

08:14.861 --> 08:18.228
To a certain extent,
all Caucasians look alike.

08:18.264 --> 08:20.960
Look,
l'm not Finnerty.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.798
l didn't sell you
this heating equipment.

08:23.836 --> 08:26.862
But l am kind of worried about what
l might have done.

08:29.141 --> 08:31.735
Because you see,
yesterday--

08:31.777 --> 08:34.610
Yes, tell us, there's no fraud
without a fairy tale.

08:34.647 --> 08:37.548
Yesterday, l was diagnosed
with Alzheimer's.

08:37.582 --> 08:39.210
Oh, my.

08:39.251 --> 08:42.380
And l'm in this
strange city and--

08:42.421 --> 08:44.855
Please come inside.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.186
l came here because
l thought

08:51.230 --> 08:54.597
you could help me
reach Finnerty.

08:54.634 --> 08:58.627
l have his wallet.
l have his briefcase, but l'm not him.

09:00.740 --> 09:03.971
Excuse the brothers
for laughing.

09:04.010 --> 09:06.069
One day we will
all die,

09:06.112 --> 09:08.774
and then we'll be
the same as that tree.

09:08.814 --> 09:10.372
No me, no you.

09:10.416 --> 09:14.318
Be that as it may,
we need heat.

09:14.353 --> 09:17.117
We need to find someone who will
take responsibility.

09:17.156 --> 09:19.215
Well, l can't do that.

09:19.258 --> 09:21.089
Then the lawsuit
proceeds.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.804
Hey, go home
and l'll stay.

09:36.842 --> 09:39.834
l just had
Chinese food.

09:44.283 --> 09:48.811
- Carmela?
- Dr. Melfi, hi. How are you?

09:48.854 --> 09:51.049
How are you is
more the point.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.888
l'm running around crazy.
My son was supposed to get coffee,

09:53.926 --> 09:57.362
or tell the maid to.
lt's the one thing l have to have.

09:58.631 --> 10:00.758
l got your note.
lt was so thoughtful.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.597
l've been calling
the hospital

10:02.635 --> 10:04.830
and they say that
Anthony's stabilized.

10:04.870 --> 10:06.269
That's what they say.

10:06.305 --> 10:08.398
lf you or anyone
needs anything,

10:08.441 --> 10:11.774
to talk or to run
interference with the doctors,

10:11.811 --> 10:14.712
- don't hesitate to call.
- l appreciate that. Thank you.

10:14.747 --> 10:17.682
l have plenty of people
around l can talk to.

10:17.717 --> 10:21.278
Of course.
Good luck.

10:28.461 --> 10:31.487
- Morning, Gab. ls he ready?
- He's eating.

10:31.530 --> 10:33.464
We're picking up
Mrs. S. at 10:00.

10:33.499 --> 10:36.332
l saw her Tuesday.
How's she holding up, poor thing?

10:36.369 --> 10:38.496
Not so hotso, really.

10:38.537 --> 10:40.528
- Coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.

10:44.276 --> 10:46.642
You hear about the thing
in the old neighborhood?

10:46.679 --> 10:48.579
l'm not busy enough
for all this?

10:48.614 --> 10:52.448
Couple of guys left three
on the floor in some Colombian laundry.

10:53.719 --> 10:55.812
Thank you.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.982
Two guys we know,
huh?

11:01.027 --> 11:02.654
Total bloodbath.

11:02.695 --> 11:05.858
Somebody said a million plus.
What a score.

11:05.898 --> 11:07.627
Fuckin' A.

11:07.667 --> 11:11.501
- Sil, Benny says you have to go.
- Yeah, all right.

11:11.537 --> 11:14.199
Listen, don't forget...

11:14.240 --> 11:16.731
Oh, honey,
your asthma kicking up?

11:16.776 --> 11:18.937
Springtime.

11:18.978 --> 11:22.072
Pollen's out of control.

11:22.114 --> 11:25.447
- l am so proud of you.
- Acting boss.

11:25.484 --> 11:27.645
l hoped the day
would never come.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.746
You've always
sold yourself short.

11:29.789 --> 11:33.190
You know, that's not what l mean.
You know me.

11:33.225 --> 11:35.420
All l ever wanted
was to carve out a little piece,

11:35.461 --> 11:37.554
enjoy some grandkids.

11:37.596 --> 11:39.996
But how many guys
could step into Tony's shoes

11:40.032 --> 11:42.523
- and do the job you're doing?
- You think?

11:42.568 --> 11:44.559
You have such strength
in crisis.

11:44.603 --> 11:47.037
Benny told me
he feels honored to drive you.

11:47.073 --> 11:50.236
You're firm about what you want without
being obnoxious about it.

11:50.276 --> 11:54.508
Sil, have you asked
yourself what happens

11:54.547 --> 11:57.038
if, God forbid,
Tony Soprano doesn't recover?

12:02.688 --> 12:06.215
Listen, Gab,
l never talk to you about my work.

12:06.258 --> 12:07.816
And?

12:07.860 --> 12:10.294
l'm gonna tell you something
l never told anybody.

12:10.329 --> 12:12.923
Back when Jackie
was at the end,

12:12.965 --> 12:16.093
he floated the idea
of me stepping up to the big seat.

12:16.135 --> 12:18.695
Not Tony, me.

12:18.738 --> 12:22.037
- Really?
- Yeah, but l thought...

12:22.074 --> 12:24.599
- it's not for me.
- Still, you wouldn't sneeze at it.

12:24.643 --> 12:27.237
l never saw myself
as that kind of guy.

12:27.279 --> 12:29.110
l'm more behind
the scenes--

12:29.148 --> 12:32.914
advice, strategy.

12:33.919 --> 12:36.319
But here you are, Sil.

12:36.355 --> 12:38.380
The times make
the man, honey,

12:38.424 --> 12:42.326
not the other way
around.

12:42.361 --> 12:45.387
Asians flip for horror films.
Plus, there's ancillary--

12:46.832 --> 12:48.595
No change with Tony.

12:48.634 --> 12:51.034
Carmela's in
goddamn pieces.

12:51.070 --> 12:53.971
Memo-- get some coffee
up to Carmela's house.

12:56.675 --> 12:59.974
Sil, Bobby was making collections
up in Roseville again last night.

13:00.012 --> 13:02.879
My time is limited.
Get him over and let's resolve this.

13:11.724 --> 13:14.192
- How's the skip doing?
- Same.

13:14.226 --> 13:16.524
You forget something,
like my cut?

13:16.562 --> 13:19.292
You believe this guy? You should've
lost some weight in that nose,

13:19.331 --> 13:21.128
keep it out
of everybody's business.

13:21.167 --> 13:23.192
l'm working on it.

13:24.737 --> 13:26.705
lt's these fucking
flowers right here.

13:26.739 --> 13:29.299
Get this shit
out of here.

13:35.681 --> 13:38.411
That was Junior's
neighborhood, so now it's mine.

13:38.450 --> 13:40.315
Keep your voice down here.

13:40.352 --> 13:42.718
A va' Napoli--
it was Eugene's going on three years.

13:42.755 --> 13:44.245
And Eugene was with me.

13:44.290 --> 13:45.814
You should have never
had it to begin with,

13:45.858 --> 13:47.723
except for the beef with
the Tastee Freez route.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.887
Junior ruled on it,
and it wasn't right then.

13:49.929 --> 13:51.829
This fucking guy.

13:51.864 --> 13:53.798
Easy.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.427
- How much we talking about?
- Three Gs a week.

13:56.468 --> 13:58.766
Maybe that's what that miserab'
admitted to you.

13:58.804 --> 14:00.965
- l heard five.
- You heard wrong.

14:01.006 --> 14:03.031
What do we
do here, Sil?

14:06.745 --> 14:09.873
- Here's the thing.
- What, skip?

14:09.915 --> 14:12.406
For the time being,
it's Bobby's.

14:13.752 --> 14:17.552
But he's still gonna
kick up to you 20/%.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.990
- How long's for the time being?
- Yeah, Sil.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.619
What, do you
speak Norwegian?

14:22.661 --> 14:26.427
For now. We'll see
how much is there.

14:31.036 --> 14:33.903
Hi, everyone.
My God, you poor thing.

14:33.939 --> 14:37.102
Hey, we just need
some lrish Spring.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.206
Good morning.

14:58.530 --> 15:00.521
Another one?

15:05.571 --> 15:07.630
Know what l
found out yesterday?

15:07.673 --> 15:10.164
What's that?

15:13.279 --> 15:14.644
Thank you.

15:14.680 --> 15:19.140
l was diagnosed
actually...

15:19.184 --> 15:21.482
with Alzheimer's.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.920
Man, l'm sorry
to hear that.

15:27.359 --> 15:29.850
My uncle has
memory loss.

15:29.895 --> 15:31.760
Maybe it's hereditary.

15:31.797 --> 15:34.527
Someone's probably
studying that.

15:39.638 --> 15:41.799
ls it possible

15:41.840 --> 15:43.967
that l am Kevin Finnerty?

15:45.678 --> 15:47.339
All right, l'll stop.

16:48.173 --> 16:51.370
- Sil.
- What?

16:51.410 --> 16:53.640
You heard about this
Orange Street takedown?

16:53.679 --> 16:56.204
The Colombians?
That you?

16:56.248 --> 16:57.772
My guy had the tip.

16:57.816 --> 17:00.080
Should be a nice
chunk for everybody.

17:00.119 --> 17:02.212
Everybody?

17:02.254 --> 17:05.519
Carmela, she gets T's cut under
the circumstances, correct?

17:05.557 --> 17:08.025
lt's your call.

17:08.060 --> 17:10.050
l know it's
my fucking call.

17:13.499 --> 17:15.592
Yes, that is
the correct thing.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.602
Oh, ladies' room's
next door.

17:19.637 --> 17:21.571
l can reach it
from here.

17:21.607 --> 17:24.075
Grim fucking scene,
that lCU.

17:24.108 --> 17:27.078
She's one brave lady.

17:27.112 --> 17:30.604
l was just saying, l'm gonna get
T's piece of my half to Sil for her.

17:30.649 --> 17:33.083
- Of the thing.
- Back up there, Bluto.

17:33.118 --> 17:35.279
Your half? l did
all the heavy lifting.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.686
You would never have
heard about it without my information.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.691
Big help.
lt was fucking mayhem.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.192
You said the place
was empty.

17:41.226 --> 17:44.195
Doc says l need an ultrasound on
my groin and balls.

17:44.229 --> 17:46.720
Sil, you wanna
weigh in here?

17:51.070 --> 17:53.129
lt breaks
half and half.

17:53.172 --> 17:56.005
You both kick Tony's
to me to deal with.

17:56.041 --> 17:59.636
l'll have it for you,
Sil, the whole 80K.

17:59.678 --> 18:03.307
Ho, ho, ho, 80K?
How's that 20/% of a million?

18:03.348 --> 18:06.408
Have a cookie, you're delirious.
lt was 750, tops.

18:06.452 --> 18:09.114
Fuck it all, Paulie.
Tommy cased that shithole.

18:09.154 --> 18:12.089
What's with the fucking
accounting out there?

18:12.124 --> 18:14.456
That's a 100 grand apiece.
You got it?

18:14.493 --> 18:16.654
We're looking
after Carmela.

18:16.695 --> 18:18.856
- No question.
- Of course.

18:18.897 --> 18:21.365
Sooner than later,
Paulie.

18:21.400 --> 18:24.301
l gotta piss first.
You want half of that, too?

18:31.043 --> 18:33.603
ln a prior incarnation,
l would

18:33.645 --> 18:35.306
get my load on,

18:35.347 --> 18:38.077
blow 20 residuals
at the track.

18:38.117 --> 18:41.109
As writers,

18:41.153 --> 18:44.782
we are all hung up.

18:44.823 --> 18:47.257
But we are also
hung up

18:47.292 --> 18:49.692
on our own hang-up.

18:49.728 --> 18:52.788
We mythologize
our inner narrative.

18:52.831 --> 18:55.766
Take for example,
''Beowulf.''

18:55.801 --> 18:57.826
Who is Grendel,

18:57.870 --> 19:00.862
but the habit,
the disease.

19:00.906 --> 19:03.636
Ah, fresh casualties

19:03.675 --> 19:05.267
in the battle
of the blank page.

19:05.310 --> 19:08.177
Welcome to the Writer's Guild.
Have a seat.

19:08.213 --> 19:11.273
Take me...

19:11.316 --> 19:14.114
my past as an addict.

19:17.422 --> 19:20.482
Get the fuck up!
Come on!

19:24.663 --> 19:26.096
Give me that
fucking fisheye.

19:26.131 --> 19:28.793
l'm offering you a way to wipe
your fucking obligation.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.064
Wasn't me who told you
to start gambling again.

19:31.103 --> 19:34.937
l can't write a feature now.
l just landed a staff job.

19:34.973 --> 19:38.374
People are seeing huge profits
with these digital horror movies.

19:38.410 --> 19:40.708
Douchebags who never
made a film before.

19:40.746 --> 19:43.510
That ''Saw'' thing,
400 grand to make,

19:43.549 --> 19:46.313
took in 100 mil
worldwide.

19:46.351 --> 19:49.184
l'm 100/% well.

19:49.221 --> 19:52.622
l deliver this script,
l owe you nothing?

19:52.658 --> 19:54.592
You hear this dude?
100/% well.

19:54.626 --> 19:56.651
He's a bad boy, huh,
with that lingo?

19:56.695 --> 19:59.095
Real fucking
dark character.

20:01.099 --> 20:03.932
My idea is ''Saw'' meets
''Godfather 2.''

20:03.969 --> 20:07.200
Proven track record--
both genres.

20:07.239 --> 20:09.207
Young wiseguy,
assassin,

20:09.241 --> 20:11.175
gets betrayed by his people.
They whack him,

20:11.210 --> 20:14.611
leave his body parts
in dumpsters all around the city.

20:14.646 --> 20:18.047
Long story short,
he is put back together by science,

20:18.083 --> 20:19.744
or maybe it's
supernatural.

20:19.785 --> 20:23.152
And he gets fucking payback on everyone
who fucked him over,

20:23.188 --> 20:25.156
including the cunt
he was engaged to.

20:25.190 --> 20:27.750
She was getting porked by his boss
the night the hero was killed.

20:29.294 --> 20:31.262
We'll have a meeting
tomorrow.

20:31.296 --> 20:33.958
We hear what you've fleshed
out before we go to script.

20:33.999 --> 20:35.864
Bing, 2:30.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.892
Don't make me
come look for you.

20:55.287 --> 20:58.984
An entire room
full of writers,

20:59.024 --> 21:01.686
and you did nothing!

21:07.399 --> 21:09.299
Sir, it's family only
in the unit.

21:09.334 --> 21:11.302
l'll be out of your hair
in a minute, sister.

21:11.336 --> 21:14.965
l keep telling you people, l'm gonna
have to call the hospital administrator.

21:23.348 --> 21:26.681
l wanted to let you know
there's a major package coming your way

21:26.718 --> 21:29.482
from Paulie and Vito,
very significant.

21:29.521 --> 21:32.388
You all have done
so much already.

21:32.424 --> 21:35.018
We just found out insurance won't pay
for physical therapy.

21:35.060 --> 21:38.655
Bastards.
So thank you.

21:38.697 --> 21:40.927
You wanna come in,
say hello?

21:40.966 --> 21:44.060
Uh, sure.

22:04.489 --> 22:06.855
- Hello, Father.
- Silvio.

22:23.508 --> 22:25.840
l have Napoleons,

22:25.877 --> 22:28.038
but l also got fruit
for a certain party.

22:28.080 --> 22:31.015
Either's good.
The program says sugar after meals

22:31.049 --> 22:33.574
- tells the body you're full.
- When you married my cousin,

22:33.618 --> 22:36.246
everybody used to say you
looked like John Travolta.

22:36.288 --> 22:39.223
He's almost back
to his white suit.

22:46.898 --> 22:48.866
The Bacala question.

22:48.900 --> 22:50.265
Bobby don't have
any claim.

22:50.302 --> 22:53.931
l don't know why Sil ruled so
half-assed on you. lt's not my style.

22:53.972 --> 22:55.405
He's worried more
about taking care of Carmela

22:55.440 --> 22:57.670
- than the actual fucking earners.
- Please.

22:57.709 --> 23:01.008
With Johnny awaiting trial and the feds
freezing his assets,

23:01.046 --> 23:03.606
who do you think's
keeping Ginny in butter brickle?

23:03.648 --> 23:07.311
Lucky for me, those last years
l was in the can,

23:07.352 --> 23:10.913
my kid brother Billy
took care of Patty and the grandkids.

23:13.592 --> 23:16.789
Only to have that
motherfucking animal Blundetto--

23:16.828 --> 23:18.921
Don't do it
to yourself, Philly.

23:21.032 --> 23:23.694
lt's hard to forget.

23:23.735 --> 23:26.761
l don't forget.

23:34.446 --> 23:36.414
l forget what
we were talking about.

23:36.448 --> 23:38.882
Me too.
What the fuck was it?

23:38.917 --> 23:40.908
Oh, yeah, Jesus.

23:40.952 --> 23:43.045
Carmela.
The thing is--

23:43.088 --> 23:45.022
You want coffee, coz?

23:45.056 --> 23:47.024
lf you're already
making it.

23:47.058 --> 23:49.049
Hot water
and lemon, hon.

23:51.430 --> 23:54.024
Honestly...

23:54.065 --> 23:56.056
how can l short Carmela?

23:57.969 --> 23:59.834
Maybe l'm not
following you.

23:59.871 --> 24:02.669
l'm as supportive as the next guy,
but there's a point.

24:02.707 --> 24:05.904
And what if Tony takes a turn
for the worse?

24:05.944 --> 24:08.742
l'm gonna hand her
$100,000,

24:08.780 --> 24:11.749
and he dies
the next day?

24:11.783 --> 24:13.751
Be money
down the drain.

24:13.785 --> 24:16.686
lt's tempting,
but you can't think that way.

24:21.092 --> 24:23.219
You all set now?

24:23.261 --> 24:26.196
Yeah, l'm living
it up here.

24:26.231 --> 24:28.199
You still stewing
about that money?

24:28.233 --> 24:29.996
Spend some,
you'll get over it.

24:30.035 --> 24:32.595
l'll never get over it.

24:32.637 --> 24:35.162
Certain people--
let me tell you.

24:35.207 --> 24:37.004
Oh, come on,
not Sil again.

24:37.042 --> 24:39.510
Carmela.
He's a fucking vegetable.

24:39.544 --> 24:42.638
But l still gotta pay
tribute to the princess of Little ltaly.

24:42.681 --> 24:46.811
- The boss' wife. What are you gonna do?
- Fuck her.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.801
l'm on my way in now.

25:03.835 --> 25:07.293
Yeah, good, and you might want to take
care of that thing we talked about.

25:07.339 --> 25:08.806
Which thing?

25:08.840 --> 25:10.831
That big piece of pie
you were bringing to the hospital

25:10.876 --> 25:12.901
She's expecting you,
so make it happen.

25:12.944 --> 25:14.036
What are you worried about?

25:14.079 --> 25:16.639
l think l know who
l'm fucking dealing with here.

25:16.681 --> 25:17.943
l resent that.

25:17.983 --> 25:19.814
You have a problem
taking orders from me?

25:19.851 --> 25:22.342
Keep your shirt on.
lt's done.

25:31.596 --> 25:34.895
Don't get in bed with him again.
You dislodged his drains.

25:34.933 --> 25:37.834
That was my daughter.

25:37.869 --> 25:41.100
And l can't help but think
that physical affection means something.

25:55.820 --> 25:58.345
They refrigerate
this place, huh?

26:07.599 --> 26:09.658
There you go.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.215
What are you still
doing out there?

26:24.249 --> 26:26.217
l got involved
in a lawsuit.

26:26.251 --> 26:28.617
- A lawsuit?
- Could create problems later.

26:28.653 --> 26:31.986
What kind of lawsuit?

26:32.023 --> 26:33.820
Hello.

26:33.858 --> 26:36.793
- Also...
- What?

26:36.828 --> 26:39.388
l had an accident.
l fell down some stairs.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.228
Oh, my God!

26:41.266 --> 26:43.291
The doctor said...

26:45.270 --> 26:48.000
What did he say?

26:48.039 --> 26:50.439
''Mild concussion,''
he said.

26:50.475 --> 26:52.443
Told me l'd be okay.

26:52.477 --> 26:55.571
That's it.
l'm coming out there.

26:55.614 --> 26:59.914
My mother's over here anyway.
She can stay with the kids.

26:59.951 --> 27:04.411
No, don't do that.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.447
Are you telling me
everything?

27:19.304 --> 27:22.637
JT, l want to introduce you
to Carmine Lupertazzi

27:22.674 --> 27:24.801
my co-executive
producer on the project.

27:24.843 --> 27:27.641
Nice to finally meet. l heard tidbits
of what Chris has got in mind--

27:27.679 --> 27:29.476
the genre
and so forth.

27:29.514 --> 27:31.675
But, JT,
l gotta warn you,

27:31.716 --> 27:34.583
l'm very hands-on.
l learned that the hard way.

27:36.921 --> 27:39.048
l wanna welcome all
of you to the first meeting

27:39.090 --> 27:41.285
of possible investors
on this project.

27:41.326 --> 27:45.524
Some of you know l've had nine pictures
under my subspecies,

27:45.563 --> 27:47.793
four in the ''South Beach
Strumpet'' series alone,

27:47.832 --> 27:51.962
each with 30,000-plus
DVDs in print.

27:52.003 --> 27:53.732
That being said, l usually find it
helpful at this stage

27:53.772 --> 27:56.172
to include my
prospective partners

27:56.207 --> 28:01.076
and get your inputs
or notes as we call them.

28:01.112 --> 28:03.444
JT, you're on.

28:05.150 --> 28:08.142
Well...

28:08.186 --> 28:11.246
we've been working on a new
kind of slasher film.

28:11.289 --> 28:13.484
lt takes place
in the world of...

28:13.525 --> 28:15.220
you know...

28:16.895 --> 28:19.363
um, the mafia.

28:19.397 --> 28:22.764
lt's about a wiseguy with a big mouth
and bigger dreams.

28:24.035 --> 28:27.732
Anyway, they call him
''The Butcher.''

28:27.772 --> 28:30.400
- No, they don't.
- Why the fuck not?

28:30.442 --> 28:34.003
Need l remind you
of a certain butcher out of A.C.?

28:34.045 --> 28:35.512
Right.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.447
Not ''Butcher.''
Go on, JT.

28:37.482 --> 28:40.007
So, right.

28:40.051 --> 28:42.884
He's kind of
outshining his boss.

28:42.921 --> 28:46.084
So the guy has him clipped,
but he's still alive

28:46.124 --> 28:47.955
when they cut him up.

28:47.992 --> 28:50.256
He's gonna feel
that the next day.

28:51.730 --> 28:54.392
Right.
So at the dump,

28:54.432 --> 28:56.832
his body
reassembles itself,

28:56.868 --> 28:58.836
all except for
a hand that got crushed.

28:58.870 --> 29:02.328
So he ties a cleaver
onto the stump

29:02.373 --> 29:06.207
and he goes out
to get revenge on everyone,

29:06.244 --> 29:08.644
especially the boss, which
is a pretty solid role.

29:08.680 --> 29:12.081
Right now it's called
''Pork Store Killer.''

29:12.117 --> 29:14.312
But l'm thinking...

29:14.352 --> 29:16.616
just...

29:16.654 --> 29:18.645
''Cleaver.''

29:21.760 --> 29:23.819
l'm confused.
You said he's dead.

29:23.862 --> 29:27.593
How's he evening up with anybody?
He's a ghost?

29:27.632 --> 29:31.090
As l understood,
a zombie of sorts.

29:31.136 --> 29:33.104
Great title,
by the way.

29:33.138 --> 29:35.265
But if they jointed him,

29:35.306 --> 29:38.901
he's not gonna end up
all in the same dump.

29:38.943 --> 29:41.411
- And how's that a slasher film?
- What are you talking about?

29:41.446 --> 29:44.609
A slasher.
A couple of kids naked in a lake.

29:44.649 --> 29:47.516
Certified maniac
on the loose, not a ghost.

29:47.552 --> 29:50.544
Actually, the maniac is almost always
a supernatural force.

29:50.588 --> 29:53.022
Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers
from ''Halloween.''

29:53.057 --> 29:54.684
Get the fuck out.

29:54.726 --> 29:57.490
Easy, Sil, easy.
He's making a point.

29:57.529 --> 30:00.657
Michael Myers is
an escaped mental patient.

30:00.698 --> 30:02.632
Jason and Freddy,
different kind of movie.

30:02.667 --> 30:04.658
Well, that's the kind
we're doing here.

30:04.702 --> 30:08.160
''Saw,'' ''The Ring''-- they made millions.
And that's not even including

30:08.206 --> 30:10.197
''The Godfather'' angle,
which we got here.

30:10.241 --> 30:12.732
What if...

30:14.846 --> 30:18.338
they disposed him
at stops

30:18.383 --> 30:21.352
that happened
to be along the same route?

30:21.386 --> 30:24.184
Then he would all end up
in the same dump.

30:26.357 --> 30:29.986
But he's a ghost?
l don't know.

30:30.028 --> 30:32.792
''Ghostbusters''-- another fucking
money machine.

30:36.234 --> 30:38.566
Cavalry's here.
l brought some cannelloni.

30:38.603 --> 30:40.070
Again.

30:40.104 --> 30:42.436
lt's got bechamel
on it,

30:42.473 --> 30:44.737
so five, six hours
out of the fridge, tops.

30:44.776 --> 30:46.641
Thank you.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.669
- Hey.
- Howdy.

30:50.215 --> 30:52.183
Look at her.

30:52.217 --> 30:56.051
That word ''plucky,''
is that what it means?

30:56.087 --> 30:57.748
Only, when do l get to spend
some face time with the skip?

30:57.789 --> 31:00.349
Hospital gets ticked off.
We'll try to sneak you.

31:00.391 --> 31:02.416
...in this mob family
domestic shooting,

31:02.460 --> 31:06.226
which some observers note carries
the echoes of the death of soul great

31:06.264 --> 31:08.824
Marvin Gaye.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.165
As 20-year-old Anthony
Soprano Jr. himself

31:11.202 --> 31:15.002
told our Amy Kean,
''Growing up Soprano,

31:15.039 --> 31:17.735
it's just plain weird.''

31:17.775 --> 31:19.640
You just wanna bite it!

31:19.677 --> 31:21.872
Big Lots! What's your
deal today?

31:21.913 --> 31:23.904
Carmela?

31:28.386 --> 31:30.786
l swear to God,
l'm gonna fucking kill you!

31:30.822 --> 31:32.551
- What the fuck?
- You made a fool of yourself

31:32.590 --> 31:35.684
and our family on national
fucking television?

31:35.727 --> 31:37.251
l didn't even say
that shit.

31:37.295 --> 31:39.195
They totally
misquoted me.

31:39.230 --> 31:41.858
- Holy shit.
- Well, of course they did.

31:41.900 --> 31:45.700
That's what they do, which is why l
and everybody else

31:45.737 --> 31:48.297
told you, ''Don't talk
to the press!''

31:48.339 --> 31:50.307
You're the one
who looked like a total asshole.

31:50.341 --> 31:52.332
Dragging me around like
l was five years old.

31:52.377 --> 31:54.902
You are a cross to bear.
That's all you are.

31:54.946 --> 31:57.073
To your father, to me,
to everybody.

31:57.115 --> 32:00.482
Fuck this.
Fuck it all!

32:02.253 --> 32:05.780
Jesus, Mel, the hell's
wrong with you?

32:05.823 --> 32:09.782
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me?

32:09.827 --> 32:11.761
Mom.

32:14.832 --> 32:17.357
lt had to happen.
She's fried.

32:34.919 --> 32:36.853
You have any
extra compensation

32:36.888 --> 32:38.856
for what you've been
going through?

32:38.890 --> 32:40.881
Nah, part of the job.

32:40.925 --> 32:43.155
Like they say,

32:43.194 --> 32:45.788
with great power comes
great responsibility.

32:48.433 --> 32:51.231
You know, Vito called me
''skip'' the other day.

32:51.269 --> 32:53.066
Really?

32:53.104 --> 32:56.733
Slip of the tongue, no doubt,
but l noticed he didn't correct himself.

32:56.774 --> 32:59.072
See?

32:59.110 --> 33:01.010
lf it did become
permanent,

33:01.045 --> 33:03.639
- your compensation might be...
- Don't go there.

33:10.221 --> 33:12.519
Hi, Gab.
l need Sil for a second.

33:12.557 --> 33:14.855
Can you keep it short?
He's pretty beat.

33:17.662 --> 33:19.527
This better be
important, Bobby.

33:19.564 --> 33:22.556
Got a new baby and two kids
in private school.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.898
This arrangement
with Vito is killing me.

33:24.936 --> 33:26.597
lt's 9:30 at night.

33:26.637 --> 33:29.731
Bobby, l don't remember
what the fuck it was.

33:29.774 --> 33:32.174
Roseville,
this temporary shit.

33:32.210 --> 33:35.179
l need an answer already.
l'm going out of my fucking mind here.

33:35.213 --> 33:36.908
l'm liable to do
something drastic.

33:36.948 --> 33:39.883
Calm the fuck down.
Let me think.

33:44.589 --> 33:46.454
Mornings are better.

33:48.026 --> 33:51.120
l'll come up
with a solution.

33:51.162 --> 33:53.790
l don't want you
to worry about it.

33:58.403 --> 34:01.770
l must have sounded odd
at the supermarket the other day.

34:03.408 --> 34:06.377
See, you're
Tony's therapist.

34:06.411 --> 34:08.811
Whether
it's appropriate...

34:08.846 --> 34:12.246
How can l help you?

34:12.283 --> 34:14.614
lt's about my son.

34:14.652 --> 34:17.518
Both kids, really.

34:17.554 --> 34:21.719
The situation
with the shooting.

34:21.759 --> 34:23.726
l'm very worried
about them.

34:23.761 --> 34:25.786
Sure.

34:25.830 --> 34:29.596
lt's a very
serious problem,

34:29.634 --> 34:32.034
you know, guns
in the home.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.504
lt's a societal concern.

34:34.539 --> 34:38.235
Obviously, we learned
our lesson too late.

34:38.275 --> 34:41.268
l immediately removed
all the firearms from the house

34:41.312 --> 34:44.543
after the goings-on
at Tony's uncle's.

34:44.581 --> 34:48.848
Anyway, last night,
l was shrieking

34:48.886 --> 34:51.446
at my son,

34:51.489 --> 34:55.016
and l said something
very cruel.

34:57.995 --> 35:01.897
And especially since
he's been trying so hard...

35:01.933 --> 35:04.959
How are you doing?

35:07.271 --> 35:09.262
You know,
l'm frazzled certainly,

35:09.307 --> 35:11.537
but l am more
worried about them.

35:11.576 --> 35:13.908
They're not kids anymore.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.913
When they were young,

35:15.947 --> 35:18.643
there were certain things
we could tell them about Tony's life.

35:18.683 --> 35:21.584
You know, lies.
We'll just call them what they were.

35:21.619 --> 35:25.487
- But now...
- So the issue isn't just

35:25.523 --> 35:27.514
guns in the home.

35:34.098 --> 35:36.726
Honestly, l think about my son
in front of those cameras,

35:36.767 --> 35:39.497
having to vouch
for all this.

35:39.537 --> 35:41.630
My daughter
and her friends.

35:41.672 --> 35:46.200
They have to face
all these years of facading.

35:46.244 --> 35:49.304
They do or you do?

35:51.282 --> 35:54.649
The minute l met Tony,
l knew who that guy was.

35:54.685 --> 35:58.280
On my second date, he brought me
and my mother each a dozen roses

35:58.322 --> 36:01.189
and my father
a $200 power drill.

36:01.225 --> 36:05.924
Not the typical story
of young love.

36:08.533 --> 36:11.764
And l don't know
if l loved him in spite of it...

36:15.406 --> 36:17.670
or because of it.

36:19.710 --> 36:23.202
My parents
weren't like that.

36:23.247 --> 36:26.045
And l knew, whether
consciously or not,

36:26.083 --> 36:27.710
l knew that behind
that power drill,

36:27.752 --> 36:29.652
there was probably
some guy with a broken arm,

36:29.687 --> 36:31.746
you know, or worse.

36:31.789 --> 36:35.725
And you coped
with that, how?

36:38.095 --> 36:40.086
l'd go to my priest,
and l would cry,

36:40.131 --> 36:42.964
and say how bad l felt
about how my husband made his money,

36:43.000 --> 36:46.094
but that was bullshit.

36:46.137 --> 36:49.129
Because there are far bigger crooks
than my husband.

36:55.012 --> 36:57.412
But the kids...

36:57.448 --> 37:01.248
they don't decide
who they're born to.

37:02.520 --> 37:04.613
So now what?

37:07.725 --> 37:09.955
Yeah, that's just it.
Now what?

37:11.362 --> 37:14.092
lt's all out in the open now,
the whole thing.

37:14.131 --> 37:16.361
And them, they're not
in grade school anymore.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.368
They become...

37:18.402 --> 37:22.099
the longer they stay
with us...

37:22.139 --> 37:24.107
Complicit.

37:24.141 --> 37:27.076
Oh, God.

37:35.152 --> 37:37.347
Putting aside the moral

37:37.388 --> 37:40.414
and legal issues,

37:40.458 --> 37:43.985
clarity can't be
a bad thing.

37:44.028 --> 37:46.656
Yes.

37:52.837 --> 37:56.238
Tony's second night
in the coma, l told him l loved him.

37:58.509 --> 38:01.478
When was the last time
l said that?

38:09.053 --> 38:11.419
Are you afraid you aren't
going to feel that way

38:11.455 --> 38:13.480
when he wakes up?

38:17.962 --> 38:20.931
Anthony tells me
things have been...

38:20.965 --> 38:22.557
better between you.

38:30.841 --> 38:32.365
Come here, honey.

38:32.410 --> 38:34.344
lt's okay, honey.
You're gonna be okay.

38:34.378 --> 38:36.812
l can't breathe.

38:36.847 --> 38:40.112
- lt's all right.
- Come here, honey.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.415
Can't breathe.
Can't breathe.

38:46.223 --> 38:50.683
lt's okay, honey.
You're gonna be okay.

38:50.728 --> 38:53.856
- What's going on?
- Would you move your car, please, sir?

38:53.898 --> 38:56.696
Sil, l didn't hear
from you.

39:00.271 --> 39:02.262
Sil's on the canvas now.

39:02.306 --> 39:04.365
Fucking 100/% disaster.

39:04.408 --> 39:07.002
Point is, Tony goes,

39:07.044 --> 39:09.012
let's face it,

39:09.046 --> 39:11.446
somebody's gonna have to
step into the breach.

39:12.616 --> 39:14.811
l'm a young man.

39:14.852 --> 39:17.685
Now without the weight,

39:17.722 --> 39:20.418
l'm a healthy man

39:20.458 --> 39:22.517
with longevity.

39:31.402 --> 39:33.666
l hear Sil
is at St. Barnabas.

39:33.704 --> 39:35.831
My God, what is
happening to us around here?

39:35.873 --> 39:38.774
Sil's gonna be fine.
You have enough worries.

39:38.809 --> 39:40.572
Listen, sweetheart,

39:40.611 --> 39:43.546
you're expecting something,
and l can't get into specifics,

39:43.581 --> 39:45.947
and Tony wouldn't
want me to,

39:45.983 --> 39:50.181
but there are certain people looking
over our shoulders right now.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.189
lt's okay, Vito.
l'm not expecting anything.

39:52.223 --> 39:55.681
Money's not an issue.
Like you said, l got bigger worries,

39:55.726 --> 39:57.421
like this son of mine.

39:57.461 --> 40:00.362
You gotta trust me
on this, hon.

40:00.398 --> 40:04.528
Suspicions get raised if we were
to move it to you at this moment.

40:05.703 --> 40:07.796
l got this.

40:09.039 --> 40:10.506
Your ma says
now's our moment.

40:10.541 --> 40:12.907
The main thing,
when people come to sit with dad,

40:12.943 --> 40:14.911
the doctors want
positive talk.

40:14.945 --> 40:17.470
- lt helps in his recovery.
- Got it.

40:19.650 --> 40:21.880
Oof, Madonn'
he looks terrible.

40:21.919 --> 40:25.013
Uncle Paulie,
you can't say stuff like that.

40:25.055 --> 40:27.285
You have to
stay positive.

40:27.324 --> 40:29.986
Yeah, it's just
nothing prepares you for that.

40:30.027 --> 40:32.495
Uncle Paulie!

40:32.530 --> 40:36.296
Only one person
at a time, please.

40:37.568 --> 40:40.298
She's a ballbuster.

40:40.337 --> 40:43.465
Finn's on his way up.
l'll be back in a few minutes, okay?

40:43.507 --> 40:46.203
Remember, stay positive.

41:10.067 --> 41:12.934
l gotta wear a jock,
the doc says.

41:12.970 --> 41:14.494
Keep the testes elevated.

41:17.541 --> 41:20.772
Of course, it could
be a lot worse, right?

41:20.811 --> 41:23.837
They gave me
an ultrasound, no rupture.

41:27.351 --> 41:29.319
l mean,
the good thing is

41:29.353 --> 41:31.344
l hurt it doing a major
piece of business.

41:31.388 --> 41:33.652
l saw a little action,

41:33.691 --> 41:37.889
and the next thing,
l was at the urologist.

41:37.928 --> 41:40.419
Fucking guy tells
me l can't expect the same things

41:40.464 --> 41:43.297
from my body no more.
l tell you, T,

41:43.334 --> 41:45.825
first the eyes,
then the teeth.

41:45.870 --> 41:48.361
Next you find out
you can't take pissing for granted.

41:48.405 --> 41:51.067
Some joke, huh?

41:51.108 --> 41:54.339
When l was in the service,
l won the chin-ups cup

41:54.378 --> 41:56.642
three weeks in a row.

41:56.680 --> 41:58.910
Fucking beautiful
definition, too.

41:58.949 --> 42:01.315
Guy asked me to model
for the boxing poster.

42:01.352 --> 42:05.721
He was half a fag,
but l was flattered just the same.

42:05.756 --> 42:08.350
Now look at this.

42:08.392 --> 42:10.553
Fucking wrinkles like
an old lady's cunt.

42:13.130 --> 42:17.590
You don't think it's gonna happen
to you, but l'm feeling it, Tony.

42:22.172 --> 42:25.733
Phineas Fogg
back in town.

42:25.776 --> 42:27.744
He forgets
all the little people.

42:27.778 --> 42:30.975
Hey, Vito,
how's Mr. Soprano doing?

42:31.015 --> 42:34.382
Let's hope he
pulls through, huh?

42:37.154 --> 42:39.122
Hi.

42:42.226 --> 42:44.717
So glad you're here.

42:44.762 --> 42:47.458
l'm gonna let
you two lovebirds be.

42:52.403 --> 42:55.099
That-- don't worry about him.
He's harmless.

42:57.575 --> 42:59.099
That fucking agita, T.

42:59.143 --> 43:02.112
l mean, do l blame
myself for this life?

43:02.146 --> 43:04.706
The shit that happens,
like with Puss.

43:04.748 --> 43:07.774
Standup one day,
FBl rat fuck the next.

43:09.620 --> 43:12.214
l felt it here, T.

43:12.256 --> 43:14.520
- l felt it right here.
- Will you please shut up in there?

43:16.527 --> 43:18.461
l'm sorry.

43:18.495 --> 43:22.625
Yes, the lnn
at the Oaks.

43:22.666 --> 43:26.966
Left on
Jamboree Boulevard?

43:27.004 --> 43:29.564
Out towards the beacon.

43:30.874 --> 43:33.365
What is that beacon
anyway?

43:35.312 --> 43:38.509
Oh.
God damn it!

43:38.549 --> 43:40.312
Shut up!
Shut up in there!

43:40.351 --> 43:41.841
So l said to Ma--

43:43.420 --> 43:45.354
What the fuck?

43:51.095 --> 43:53.495
Dr. Budraja,
stat to room 3.

43:53.530 --> 43:56.658
Nurse, don't leave!
Help!

43:58.335 --> 44:01.827
- Out of the way, sir.
- Oh, my God! What's happening?

44:01.872 --> 44:04.966
Soprano, V-tach
on the monitor.

44:05.009 --> 44:06.874
- Thready pulse.
- Take his pressure. Get a board ready.

44:06.910 --> 44:09.879
- 80 palp.
- All right, let's bag him.

44:09.913 --> 44:12.381
Oh my God, is he dying?
Where's my mom?

44:12.416 --> 44:14.350
l don't know
what's happening.

44:15.352 --> 44:17.377
One, two, three.

44:17.421 --> 44:19.389
Oh, my God!

44:19.423 --> 44:22.051
Still V-tach at 210.

44:22.092 --> 44:24.253
150 mg of amiodaraone.

44:24.294 --> 44:26.455
Grab the paddles.
Clear the room.

44:26.497 --> 44:27.828
Cardiovert at 100.

44:27.865 --> 44:30.493
- Dad!
- Stand back.

44:30.534 --> 44:32.365
- Daddy!
- All clear.

44:32.403 --> 44:34.803
Clear.

44:36.240 --> 44:39.073
- 200.
- Stand back.

44:39.109 --> 44:41.168
- All clear.
- Clear.

45:32.296 --> 45:33.786
Excuse me.

45:33.831 --> 45:36.299
ls this
the Finnerty reunion?

45:36.333 --> 45:38.563
Hello there.
They're waiting for you.

45:38.602 --> 45:40.832
- Me?
- Of course.

45:42.940 --> 45:45.306
Has Kevin Finnerty
arrived?

45:45.342 --> 45:46.673
We don't talk
like that here.

45:46.710 --> 45:48.905
What do you mean?

45:48.946 --> 45:50.937
Your family's inside.

45:53.617 --> 45:56.552
- What family?
- They're here to welcome you.

45:56.587 --> 45:58.714
l don't understand.

45:58.756 --> 46:01.520
- You're going home.
- l am?

46:15.806 --> 46:18.468
Everyone's in there.

46:25.449 --> 46:28.418
- You can't bring business in there.
- Daddy.

46:30.187 --> 46:34.419
l lost my real briefcase.

46:34.458 --> 46:36.449
My whole life was in it.

46:36.493 --> 46:39.860
Don't go, Daddy.

46:43.400 --> 46:46.528
- What is that?
- Briefcases aren't allowed.

46:46.570 --> 46:49.630
- No, the voice.
- Please, let me take that from you.

46:51.508 --> 46:53.476
- Looks like it weighs a ton.
- l don't want to.

46:53.510 --> 46:55.501
Well, you need to.
You need to let go.

46:55.546 --> 47:00.074
We love you, Daddy.
Don't leave us.

47:11.228 --> 47:13.924
For some reason...

47:13.964 --> 47:15.829
l'm scared.

47:15.866 --> 47:18.699
Well, there's nothing
to be scared of.

47:18.735 --> 47:20.760
You can let it go.

47:21.839 --> 47:25.400
Just come say hello.

47:25.442 --> 47:27.740
All right.

47:32.082 --> 47:34.846
Daddy!

47:36.887 --> 47:39.651
Please don't leave us,
Daddy. We love you.

47:52.536 --> 47:54.436
Dad?

47:54.471 --> 47:56.996
His eyes are open.

47:57.040 --> 48:00.339
Daddy, look at
me right here.

48:00.377 --> 48:01.844
All right, normal
sinus rhythm.

48:01.879 --> 48:03.847
- Pulse and pressure?
- Good.

48:03.881 --> 48:07.339
Oh my God!
Thank God. Thank God.

48:07.384 --> 48:09.011
Hang an amiodaraone drip

48:09.052 --> 48:11.612
and send off a set
of electrolytes now.

48:11.655 --> 48:14.453
Dad, look,
here you are.

48:18.662 --> 48:20.960
So l'm holding his hand,
and all of a sudden

48:20.998 --> 48:22.966
the machines
go bullshit.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.627
You told us,
for Christ's sake.

48:24.668 --> 48:26.568
Those fucking doctors,
it's their fault.

48:26.603 --> 48:29.333
Skip's gonna make it.
He's conscious.

48:31.975 --> 48:34.637
Oh, thank God!

48:56.500 --> 48:59.094
l got it, honey.

49:00.504 --> 49:02.062
Fuck took you so long?

49:02.105 --> 49:04.471
l had to get it
together, didn't l?

49:08.545 --> 49:10.809
We gotta get
that cut to her now.

49:10.847 --> 49:13.782
Easy, that's
a fucking guilty move.

49:13.817 --> 49:16.411
Tony's conscious.
You capisce?

49:16.453 --> 49:18.819
Everybody and his
mother was in there talking to him

49:18.855 --> 49:20.823
when he was in that coma.
Carmela.

49:20.857 --> 49:22.290
Who knows what
the fuck they said?

49:22.326 --> 49:25.989
Maybe he's expecting
that money.

49:26.029 --> 49:27.997
Jesus Christ.

49:33.036 --> 49:35.834
He can't talk yet because of the tube
that was in his throat.

49:35.872 --> 49:39.831
Maybe we should consider
ourselves lucky there.

49:42.145 --> 49:44.705
But we are very happy,
aren't we?

49:44.748 --> 49:49.117
Anthony, you had us
so worried.

49:49.152 --> 49:51.746
l haven't been to church that much
since l quit playing bingo.

49:52.889 --> 49:56.188
What, honey?

49:59.096 --> 50:01.826
l'm dead, right?

50:03.033 --> 50:06.059
No no, you're
in the hospital

50:06.103 --> 50:07.832
with all of us.

50:07.871 --> 50:09.896
ln Newark.

50:09.940 --> 50:12.272
Mr. Soprano,
how are you today?

50:12.309 --> 50:14.709
l'm Dr. Vahapsideh.
l'm a neurologist.

50:20.517 --> 50:22.576
How's he doing,
sweetheart?

50:22.619 --> 50:24.917
l don't know if we're out of the woods
yet, but he's hanging in.

50:24.955 --> 50:29.221
He just passed his
first simple mental acuity test, so...

50:29.259 --> 50:31.819
Your strength,
that was the difference.

50:34.097 --> 50:38.761
Oh, a little something
from us.

50:38.802 --> 50:41.930
Help defray medical costs,
rehabilitation.

50:41.972 --> 50:45.066
Jesus, l don't know
what to say.

50:45.108 --> 50:47.076
This is what
we do, honey.

50:47.110 --> 50:48.941
l'd want the same
for my Marie.

50:48.979 --> 50:51.948
Or my ma.

50:58.255 --> 51:00.985
We're here
if you need anything.

51:17.641 --> 51:20.474
Great fucking news, T.

51:23.513 --> 51:25.504
See you're up
and around.

51:28.785 --> 51:30.776
Best.

51:41.665 --> 51:44.759
''Sometimes l go about
in pity for myself,

51:44.801 --> 51:46.792
and all the while,

51:46.837 --> 51:49.897
a great wind carries me
across the sky.

51:49.940 --> 51:51.999
Ojibwe saying.''

51:52.042 --> 51:54.033
lndians, right?

51:56.313 --> 51:57.940
Who put this up?

52:03.220 --> 52:06.747
Listen, T, something l wanted
to talk to you about.

52:12.496 --> 52:14.987
l'm gonna take another run
at the movie business.

52:18.368 --> 52:20.928
l know you haven't
liked that in the past,

52:20.971 --> 52:24.429
but l'm going about it
in a whole different way.

52:24.474 --> 52:27.102
ln fact, l'm hoping
you'll become an investor

52:27.144 --> 52:29.112
when you feel
a little better,

52:29.146 --> 52:31.876
and l can explain what we're doing.
lt's pretty exciting.

52:31.915 --> 52:33.473
We'll own the neg.

52:33.517 --> 52:35.712
That's what they call it.
lt means negative.

52:38.088 --> 52:41.319
l'm holding a large
ownership position

52:41.358 --> 52:44.589
open for you.
l hope you approve.

52:47.597 --> 52:52.193
Actually, frankly...

52:52.235 --> 52:54.897
all due respect,

52:54.938 --> 52:57.532
l think you owe me this,

52:57.574 --> 52:59.872
as l came to you
about Adriana.

53:01.745 --> 53:03.474
You've got him up?

53:03.513 --> 53:07.347
l know how it looks, but he should
be upright as much as possible.

53:07.384 --> 53:10.217
- l'm gonna leave you two alone.
- Thanks for everything.

53:10.253 --> 53:12.585
Okay.

53:18.495 --> 53:20.986
l don't know
how you do it.

53:37.714 --> 53:40.182
That's gotta feel
good, huh?

53:40.217 --> 53:43.152
The simple things.
